Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit stuck, but let's try to work through it step by step. The question is about finding the concentration of orthophosphate ions in a solution that contains two different phosphoric acid salts. Hmm, I remember that orthophosphate is the HPO4^2- ion, right?

The solution has a volume of 200.00 cm³, which I can convert to liters later. It contains 1.00 g of KH2PO4 and 1.00 g of Na2HPO4·2H2O. The molecular weights are given as 136.09 g/mol and 177.99 g/mol, respectively. The temperatures are at 25°C, which is standard, so I don't need to worry about temperature effects on the K values unless something unusual happens, which I don't think it does here.

The problem gives me the three dissociation constants for H3PO4: Ka1 = 7.5e-3, Ka2 = 6.2e-8, and Ka3 = 1.8e-12. Right, these are the acid dissociation constants, which tell us about the strength of each deprotonation step.

I think the overall approach here is to determine the concentrations of the different phosphate species in the solution and find out which one contributes to the orthophosphate ion (HPO4^2-). But wait, the solution is a mixture of two salts, so I should first calculate how much each salt contributes to each phosphate species.

First, let's figure out the moles of each salt. Moles are mass divided by molecular weight.

For KH2PO4: moles = 1.00 g / 136.09 g/mol. Let me calculate that. 1 divided by 136.09 is approximately 0.007334 mol. Wait, wait, 1 / 136 is roughly 0.00735, so about 0.00733 moles.

For Na2HPO4·2H2O: The formula weight is 177.99 g/mol. So moles = 1.00 / 177.99 ≈ 0.005616 moles.

Wait, but Na2HPO4·2H2O is sodium hydrogen phosphate dihydrate. When it dissolves, I think each formula unit releases HPO4^2- and Na+ ions. Let me think: Na2HPO4 dissociates into 2 Na+ and HPO4^2-. So each mole of Na2HPO4·2H2O gives one mole of HPO4^2-.

Similarly, KH2PO4 dissociates into K+ and H2PO4^- (since H3PO4 is a triprotic acid, H2PO4^- is the dihydrogen phosphate ion). Wait, but when it dissociates, does it go further? Like, in solution, H2PO4^- can lose another proton to become HPO4^2- or gain a proton to become H3PO4.

Wait, but the solution is a buffer, perhaps? Because it's a mixture of two different phosphate salts. So the H2PO4^- (from KH2PO4) and HPO4^2- (from Na2HPO4·2H2O) can react in solution. So this is a buffer solution.

So the solution is a buffer between H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-.

Wait, no, because H2PO4^- can act as an acid (losing a proton to become HPO4^2-), and HPO4^2- can act as a base (gaining a proton to become H2PO4^-). So the buffer is around the pKa2 of H3PO4, which is the second ionization step.

Because the first dissociation is H3PO4 → H+ + H2PO4^-, and the second is H2PO4^- → H+ + HPO4^2-, and the third is HPO4^2- → H+ + PO4^3-.

So, the problem is about finding [HPO4^2-], which is influenced by the buffer system created by H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-.

I think I can use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation here because the solution is buffered between H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-.

Henderson-Hasselbalch equation is pH = pKa + log([base]/[acid]). In this case, the base is HPO4^2- and the acid is H2PO4^-.

Wait, no, wait. The second dissociation is H2PO4^- → H+ + HPO4^2- (Ka2 = 6.2e-8). So the acid is H2PO4^- and the conjugate base is HPO4^2-.

So the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation would be pH = pKa2 + log([HPO4^2-]/[H2PO4^-]).

But I don't know the pH of the solution. Hmm. So perhaps I need another approach. Alternatively, perhaps I can calculate the concentrations of each species based on their moles and the volume, and then account for the dissociation.

Wait, but the solution may not be at the same pH as the pKa of the buffer, but perhaps the buffer is such that the pH is determined by the H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- concentrations.

Wait, let me think again. The problem is to find the concentration of orthophosphate ions, which is HPO4^2-.

So, let's calculate the initial amounts of each phosphate species.

KH2PO4 dissociates completely into K+ and H2PO4^-.

So moles of H2PO4^- from KH2PO4: 0.007334 mol.

Na2HPO4·2H2O dissociates completely into 2 Na+ and HPO4^2-.

So moles of HPO4^2- from Na2HPO4·2H2O: 0.005616 mol.

But in solution, the H2PO4^- can lose a proton to become HPO4^2-, and the HPO4^2- can gain a proton to become H2PO4^-.

So the solution will have both H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-, but their actual concentrations will depend on the pH.

Wait, but since the solution is a mixture of these two salts, which are both phosphate buffers, the solution's pH is determined by the ratio of their concentrations.

So, let's compute the concentrations of each in the solution.

The total volume is 200 cm³ = 0.2 L.

Concentration of H2PO4^- from KH2PO4: 0.007334 mol / 0.2 L = 0.03667 M.

Concentration of HPO4^2- from Na2HPO4·2H2O: 0.005616 mol / 0.2 L = 0.02808 M.

These are their initial concentrations from the salts.

But in solution, H2PO4^- can react with HPO4^2- via the second dissociation:

H2PO4^- ⇌ H+ + HPO4^2-.

The Ka for this is Ka2 = 6.2e-8.

So the H2PO4^- will donate protons to HPO4^2-, but the extent of this depends on how much each is present and the Ka value.

Wait, but the Henderson equation requires knowing the pH. Alternatively, can I find the pH using the given concentrations?

Alternatively, perhaps the solution is a buffer solution, and the pH can be approximated using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation.

Let me try that. The Henderson equation would be:

pH = pKa2 + log([HPO4^2-]/[H2PO4^-]).

But what is the pH of the solution? Well, without knowing the pH, it's tricky. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I can find the pH of the solution based on the concentrations of H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-.

Wait, but unless I have more information, like the pH, I can't proceed. Alternatively, perhaps I can calculate the pH using the initial concentrations and the Ka2.

Let me think: the concentrations of H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- are 0.03667 M and 0.02808 M, respectively.

The reaction is:

H2PO4^- ⇌ H+ + HPO4^2-.

Ka2 = [H+][HPO4^2-]/[H2PO4^-].

Let me denote:

Let x be the change in H+ concentration. But wait, let me set up the equation.

Initially:
[H2PO4^-] = 0.03667 M
[HPO4^2-] = 0.02808 M
[H+] is unknown.

At equilibrium, suppose some H2PO4^- dissociates into H+ and HPO4^2-.

So, let me let the change be +y for [H+], +y for [HPO4^2-], and -y for [H2PO4^-].

Thus:

[H2PO4^-] = 0.03667 - y ≈ 0.03667 (since y is likely to be small, considering Ka is 6.2e-8, which is small)
[HPO4^2-] = 0.02808 + y ≈ 0.02808
[H+] = y.

Ka2 = (y)(0.02808) / (0.03667) ) ≈ 6.2e-8.

So, let's compute:

y = (Ka2 * 0.03667) / 0.02808.

Plugging in the numbers:

Ka2 is 6.2e-8.

So,

y = (6.2e-8 * 0.03667) / 0.02808.

Calculate numerator: 6.2e-8 * 0.03667 ≈ 2.270e-9.

Divide by 0.02808: 2.270e-9 / 0.02808 ≈ 8.08e-8.

So [H+] ≈ 8.08e-8 M. Therefore, pH = -log(8.08e-8) ≈ 7.096.

Wait, but the solution's pH is determined by the buffer, so the H+ is around 8e-8 M, leading to a pH of about 7.1, which seems reasonable.

But wait, I'm trying to find [HPO4^2-]. Wait, but because some of the H2PO4^- dissociates into H+ and HPO4^2-, but for each mole of H2PO4^- that dissociates, one mole of HPO4^2- is formed.

But given that Ka2 is small, the change y would be small, so the approximation holds.

Wait, but in the initial concentrations, HPO4^2- is 0.02808 M, and H2PO4^- is 0.03667 M. We can use the Henderson equation to find pH.

pH = pKa2 + log([HPO4^2-]/[H2PO4^-]).

pKa2 is log(6.2e-8) is approximately 7.207.

Wait, let me calculate pKa2:

Ka2 = 6.2e-8 → pKa = log(1/(6.2e-8)) → wait, no, pKa is -log(Ka).

So pKa2 = -log(6.2e-8) → log(6.2) is about 0.792, so 7.208.

So pH = 7.208 + log(0.02808 / 0.03667).

Compute the ratio: 0.02808 / 0.03667 ≈ 0.766.

Log(0.766) is about -0.114.

So pH ≈ 7.208 - 0.114 = 7.094, which matches the earlier approximation.

But how does this help me find [HPO4^2-]? Alternatively, perhaps the initial concentrations are a good approximation because the change is small. Let me compare.

Wait, the initial [HPO4^2-] is 0.02808 M, and from the dissociation, it increases by y, which is 8.08e-8 M. But 8e-8 is negligible compared to 0.028 M. So the initial approximation holds, and the change can be ignored.

So the concentration of HPO4^2- is approximately 0.02808 M? But wait, that can't be right because the problem is a mixture of the two salts, and the H2PO4^- can donate H+ to HPO4^2-, so the actual concentration should be higher than 0.028 M.

Wait, let me think again. The solution contains 0.03667 M H2PO4^- and 0.02808 M HPO4^2-.

The reaction H2PO4^- <-> H+ + HPO4^2- has a Ka2 of 6.2e-8.

So the ratio [HPO4^2-]/[H2PO4^-] = Ka2 / [H+].

Wait, no, the Henderson equation is pH = pKa + log([base]/[acid]), where base is HPO4^2-, acid is H2PO4^-.

So [HPO4^2-] = [base] = 0.02808 + x.

[H2PO4^-] = 0.03667 - x.

But because Ka is small, x is small compared to the initial concentrations, so we can approximate [HPO4^2-] ≈ 0.02808 and [H2PO4^-] ≈ 0.03667.

But that would make [HPO4^2-] about 0.028 M, but that's before considering the dissociation.

Wait, but perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me consider the buffer solution. The concentrations of H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- are given, and the solution's pH is determined by their ratio via the Henderson equation.

But wait, the question is asking for [HPO4^2-], which is already known based on the initial moles and the volume. But that can't be right because the presence of H2PO4^- would cause some of it to dissociate, increasing [HPO4^2-].

So, perhaps I should calculate the concentrations considering the dissociation.

Let me set up the equation again.

Let the initial concentrations be:

[H2PO4^-] = 0.03667 M

[HPO4^2-] = 0.02808 M.

At equilibrium, let the change in [H2PO4^-] be -x, and the change in [HPO4^2-] be +x, with [H+] = x.

But wait, no, because H2PO4^- dissociates into H+ and HPO4^2-.

So the equation is:

Ka2 = (x)(0.02808 + x) / (0.03667 - x).

Assuming x is small compared to 0.02808 and 0.03667, we can approximate:

Ka2 ≈ (x)(0.02808) / (0.03667).

So x ≈ (Ka2 * 0.03667) / 0.02808.

Which is the same as before, so x ≈ 8.08e-8 M.

So [HPO4^2-] = 0.02808 + x ≈ 0.02808 + 8.08e-8 ≈ 0.028088 M. But since 8e-8 is so small, it's negligible.

Therefore, the concentration of HPO4^2- is approximately 0.02808 M, but wait, that seems too high. Because the initial HPO4^2- was 0.02808 M, and the change is so small.

Wait, but wait, perhaps I made a wrong assumption. Because the solution is a mixture of these two, perhaps the H2PO4^- will react with HPO4^2- to form more HPO4^2- and H+. But how?

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider the total phosphate concentration and the distribution among the species.

Wait, another approach: all the phosphate in the solution comes from the two salts. The total moles of phosphate are:

From KH2PO4: 1 mole of H2PO4^- per mole.

From Na2HPO4·2H2O: 1 mole of HPO4^2- per mole.

So total moles of phosphate in the solution is 0.007334 + 0.005616 = 0.01295 mol.

But wait, phosphate can exist in different forms: H3PO4, H2PO4^-, HPO4^2-, PO4^3-.

At pH 7.1, which is near pKa2 (7.2), the dominant species are H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-.

The third dissociation (HPO4^2- ↔ PO4^3- + H+) has a very small Ka3 of 1.8e-12, so PO4^3- concentration is negligible. Similarly, the first dissociation is H3PO4 → H+ + H2PO4^-; but H3PO4 is a weak acid, and at pH 7.1, there's not much H3PO4, so we can ignore it.

So the main species are H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-.

The total phosphate concentration is [H2PO4^-] + [HPO4^2-] ≈ 0.03667 + 0.02808 = 0.06475 M, but wait, that's in 0.2 L, so total moles would be 0.06475 M * 0.2 L = 0.01295 mol, which matches the sum of the moles from the two salts.

So, using the Henderson equation, pH = pKa2 + log([HPO4^2-]/[H2PO4^-]).

We can rearrange to find [HPO4^2-] in terms of [H2PO4^-].

But without knowing the pH, perhaps we can express [HPO4^2-] in terms of [H2PO4^-] and the given Ka.

But perhaps I can consider the ratio.

From the Henderson equation, [HPO4^2-]/[H2PO4^-] = 10^(pH - pKa2).

But we don't have pH. Wait, but perhaps using the initial concentrations and the fact that the solution is a buffer, I can find the ratio.

Wait, but the solution's pH is determined by the ratio of [HPO4^2-] to [H2PO4^-], so perhaps without knowing the pH, I can't directly find [HPO4^2-].

Alternatively, perhaps because the initial concentrations are known, and the solution is a buffer, the concentrations are in equilibrium, and I can calculate [HPO4^2-] using the given Ka.

Wait, let's model it as an equilibrium.

Let me denote:

Total phosphate = [H2PO4^-] + [HPO4^2-] = 0.06475 M.

Let me assume that [H2PO4^-] = a, [HPO4^2-] = b.

So a + b = 0.06475.

The Ka2 equation is Ka2 = ( [H+][HPO4^2-] ) / [H2PO4^-] = ( [H+] * b ) / a.

But without knowing [H+], this is a bit tricky. Alternatively, express [H+] in terms of a and b.

Wait, but perhaps I can express [H+] in terms of the buffer.

Alternatively, since the solution is a buffer, [H+] = Ka2 * (a / b).

But wait, from the Henderson equation, pH = pKa2 + log(b/a), so log(b/a) = pH - pKa2.

Taking 10^ both sides, (b/a) = 10^(pH - pKa2).

But without knowing pH, this becomes a bit of a loop.

Wait, another approach. Let's consider that the solution's pH is determined by the buffer. So, the ratio [HPO4^2-]/[H2PO4^-] = 10^(pH - pKa2).

But without knowing pH, perhaps I can find another equation.

Wait, I have two variables: a and b. But I have two equations:

1) a + b = 0.06475.

2) b = a * ( [H+] / Ka2 ).

Wait, no, from the Ka2 equation: Ka2 = ( [H+][HPO4^2-] ) / [H2PO4^-] → [H+] = (Ka2 * a) / b.

Wait, but I can relate [H+] to the pH of the solution, which I don't know. Alternatively, perhaps I can express [H+] in terms of a and b.

But I'm stuck because I have two variables (a and b) and two equations but one involves pH which is unknown.

Hmm. Maybe I should make an assumption based on the given Ka values and the concentrations.

Wait, perhaps the solution's pH is around 7.1, which is near neutral. So the ratio [HPO4^2-]/[H2PO4^-] is about 10^(7.1-7.208) = 10^(-0.108) ≈ 0.776.

So, [HPO4^2-] ≈ 0.776 * [H2PO4^-].

But the sum of [HPO4^2-] and [H2PO4^-] is 0.06475.

Let me set up the equations:

Equation 1: a + b = 0.06475.

Equation 2: b = 0.776 * a.

Substituting equation 2 into equation 1:

a + 0.776 a = 0.06475 → 1.776 a = 0.06475 → a ≈ 0.03644 M.

Then, b = 0.06475 - 0.03644 = 0.02831 M.

But wait, the initial [HPO4^2-] was 0.02808 M, and from the Henderson equation, the ratio is about 0.776, leading to [HPO4^2-] being 0.02831 M. That's a bit higher than the initial. But why?

Wait, because some of the H2PO4^- is dissociating into H+ and HPO4^2-, thereby increasing [HPO4^2-]. So the initial [HPO4^2-] was 0.02808 M, but after dissociation, it's 0.02831 M. The change is about 0.00023 M, which is a 0.8% increase. That's probably negligible, but maybe that's the way to proceed.

Wait, but this approach led to [HPO4^2-] being approximately 0.0283 M, which is very close to the initial 0.02808 M. So perhaps the initial [HPO4^2-] is a good approximation, and the small change due to dissociation can be neglected.

Wait, but then why did the calculation give a slightly higher value? Because the buffer equation is taking into account the ratio. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps I can consider that the majority of the phosphate species is H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-, and the concentrations are as given, with the ratio determined by the Henderson equation.

Wait, but the question is to find the concentration of orthophosphate ions, which is HPO4^2-.

So, after considering all these steps, what is [HPO4^2-]?

Wait, perhaps the answer is the initial moles divided by volume, which is 0.005616 mol / 0.2 L = 0.02808 M, which is 2.808e-2 M, but wait that's way higher than any of the options given. Wait, the options are on the order of 1e-7 M. Hmm, that can't be right.

Wait, wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial calculation of the moles.

Wait, let me re-calculate the moles:

KH2PO4: 1.00 g / 136.09 g/mol.

1/136.09 ≈ 0.007334 mol.

Na2HPO4·2H2O: 1.00 g /177.99 g/mol ≈ 0.005616 mol.

Wait, but wait, wait a second. I think I made a mistake in the initial assumption. Let me think again.

Wait, no, because the problem asks for the concentration of orthophosphate ions (HPO4^2-). The Na2HPO4·2H2O dissociates completely into HPO4^2-.

So the moles of HPO4^2- from Na2HPO4·2H2O are 0.005616 mol.

But the KH2PO4 dissociates into H2PO4^-.

The H2PO4^- can react with HPO4^2- to form more HPO4^2-.

So the total [HPO4^2-] is 0.005616 mol / 0.2 L + (some from H2PO4^- dissociation).

But how much?

Let me set up the equation again.

Initial concentrations:

[H2PO4^-] = 0.007334 / 0.2 = 0.03667 M.

[HPO4^2-] = 0.005616 / 0.2 = 0.02808 M.

Let x be the amount of H2PO4^- that dissociates into H+ and HPO4^2-.

So:

[H2PO4^-] = 0.03667 - x.

[HPO4^2-] = 0.02808 + x.

Ka2 = [H+][HPO4^2-]/[H2PO4^-] = (x)(0.02808 + x) / (0.03667 - x).

Assuming x is much smaller than 0.02808 and 0.03667, we can approximate:

Ka2 ≈ (x * 0.02808) / 0.03667.

So,

x ≈ (Ka2 * 0.03667) / 0.02808.

Plugging in the numbers:

Ka2 is 6.2e-8.

So,

x = (6.2e-8 * 0.03667) / 0.02808.

Calculate numerator: 6.2e-8 * 0.03667 ≈ 2.27e-9.

Divide by 0.02808: 2.27e-9 / 0.02808 ≈ 8.08e-8.

So x ≈ 8.08e-8 M.

Thus, [HPO4^2-] = 0.02808 + 8.08e-8 ≈ 0.028088 M.

But wait, that's about 0.028 M, which is 2.8e-2 M, but the answer options are around 1e-7 M. So that can't be right. Hmm, did I make a mistake?

Wait, maybe I confused the units somewhere.

Wait, 200 cm³ is 0.2 liters, correct.

Wait, perhaps I messed up the problem statement. Let me re-read.

Wait, the problem says 1.00 g of KH2PO4 and 1.00 g of Na2HPO4·2H2O. So, the moles are correct as 0.007334 and 0.005616, respectively.

Wait, but the problem is asking for orthophosphate (HPO4^2-), which comes from Na2HPO4·2H2O and from the dissociation of H2PO4^-.

But wait, perhaps the presence of K+ and Na+ ions doesn't affect the concentration of HPO4^2- because they're spectator ions. So the [HPO4^2-] is determined by the buffer solution.

Wait, but if I'm getting [HPO4^2-] ≈ 0.028 M, which is 2.8e-2 M, but the answer options are in the 1e-7 range. That suggests I'm way off.

Wait, perhaps I made a miscalculation in the moles. Let me double-check.

Wait, 1.00 g KH2PO4 / 136.09 g/mol = 1 / 136.09 = approx 0.007334 mol.

Similarly, 1.00 g Na2HPO4·2H2O /177.99 g/mol is 1/177.99 ≈ 0.005616 mol.

Hmm, that's correct.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that the solution is dilute, and the contribution from both salts leads to a lower concentration.

Wait, but 0.028 M would be approximately 28 mM, but the options are about 1e-7 M. That's way lower. So I must have made a mistake in my approach.

Wait, perhaps the question is not about the total HPO4^2- but about the concentration due to the phosphate ions in solution, considering their dissociation into HPO4^2-.

Wait, but that's what I was trying to calculate.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that the solution's pH is not 7.1, but lower, so that the [HPO4^2-] is much lower. But why? Let me think again.

Another approach: perhaps the solution is not a buffer but a solution where the dominant species is H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-, but the exact concentration can be found via the K expressions.

Wait, but I'm getting stuck. Let me try to approach this differently.

The problem is to find the concentration of orthophosphate, HPO4^2-.

The solution contains two phosphate salts: KH2PO4 and Na2HPO4·2H2O.

Each salt contributes to different phosphate species:

KH2PO4 → K+ + H2PO4^-.

Na2HPO4·2H2O → 2 Na+ + HPO4^2- + 2 H2O.

So the initial concentrations are:

[H2PO4^-] = 1.00 g / (136.09 g/mol * 0.2 L) = (0.007334 mol) / 0.2 L = 0.03667 M.

[HPO4^2-] = 0.005616 mol / 0.2 L = 0.02808 M.

But in solution, H2PO4^- can donate a proton to become HPO4^2-, and HPO4^2- can accept a proton to become H2PO4^-.

The reaction is H2PO4^- ⇌ H+ + HPO4^2-.

Ka2 = 6.2e-8.

So, using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation:

pH = pKa2 + log( [HPO4^2-] / [H2PO4^-] )

But without knowing pH, perhaps I can calculate the ratio.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use the initial concentrations to find the pH and then find [HPO4^2-].

But I'm stuck because I don't know pH, and the approach seems circular.

Wait, perhaps the solution is to consider that the concentration of HPO4^2- is determined by the buffer equation.

Another approach: perhaps the solution is such that the ratio [HPO4^2-]/[H2PO4^-] = (Ka2)/( [H+] )

But without [H+], I can't proceed.

Wait, but perhaps I can express [H+] in terms of the concentrations.

Wait, from the expression:

Ka2 = [H+][HPO4^2-]/[H2PO4^-]

So,

[H+] = (Ka2 * [H2PO4^-]) / [HPO4^2-]

But wait, the [H+] can also be found from the water dissociation, but that's negligible here.

Alternatively, perhaps I can assume that the solution's pH is such that the concentrations are in equilibrium.

But perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me try to model it with the variables.

Let me denote:

a = [H2PO4^-] = 0.03667 - x.

b = [HPO4^2-] = 0.02808 + x.

Ka2 = (x)(b) / a.

But I can't solve for x directly without knowing more.

Alternatively, perhaps I can assume that x is negligible compared to 0.03667 and 0.02808.

So:

Ka2 ≈ (x * 0.02808) / 0.03667 → x ≈ (Ka2 * 0.03667) / 0.02808 → same as before, x ≈ 8.08e-8.

So the change is negligible, so [HPO4^2-] remains approximately 0.02808 M.

But that's way higher than the options given, so I must have made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that I'm considering the solution as a buffer, but in reality, the solution is not a buffer because the amounts of H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- are fixed, and their concentrations are determined by the dissociation.

Alternatively, perhaps the solution is a buffer, and the [HPO4^2-] is determined by the buffer equation.

Wait, but the options are in the order of 1e-7 M, which is way lower than 0.028 M.

Hmm. I'm clearly missing something here. Let me try to think differently.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial step. Let me recheck.

Wait, the problem asks for the concentration of orthophosphate ions (HPO4^2-). Let me consider that the orthophosphate ion can come from both salts and their dissociation.

Wait, but from Na2HPO4·2H2O, it's already HPO4^2-, so that contributes directly.

From KH2PO4, H2PO4^- can dissociate into H+ and HPO4^2-.

So the total [HPO4^2-] is the sum of the initial amount plus the amount formed from H2PO4^- dissociation.

But the H2PO4^- can also accept a proton to form H3PO4, but that's negligible because Ka1 is 7.5e-3, which is larger than Ka2, so at pH around 7, the H3PO4 would be less.

Wait, but I'm still getting stuck.

Wait, another approach: the solution contains both H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-, which are in equilibrium. The concentration of HPO4^2- will depend on the pH, which in turn depends on the ratio of their concentrations.

But without knowing the pH, it's challenging. Maybe I can calculate the pH using the initial concentrations and the Ka2.

Wait, perhaps the solution's pH is determined by the initial concentrations.

Wait, the initial concentrations of H2PO4^- is 0.03667 M, and HPO4^2- is 0.02808 M.

So,

pH = pKa2 + log( [HPO4^2-]/[H2PO4^-} )

pKa2 = log(1/(6.2e-8)) → 7.207.

[ HPO4^2- ] / [ H2PO4^- ] = 0.02808 / 0.03667 ≈ 0.766.

log(0.766) ≈ -0.114.

So pH = 7.207 - 0.114 ≈ 7.093.

Now, knowing the pH, I can use this to find the equilibrium concentrations.

But wait, how does this help me find the [HPO4^2-]?

Wait, perhaps I can use the pH to find the ratio of [HPO4^2-] to [H2PO4^-], and then find their exact concentrations.

But the sum of their concentrations is 0.03667 + 0.02808 = 0.06475 M.

Wait, but wait, their sum is the total phosphate concentration, which is fixed.

But [HPO4^2-] = (ratio) * [H2PO4^-}.

So,

[HPO4^2-} = (10^(pH - pKa2)) * [H2PO4^-}.

But I have [HPO4^2-} + [H2PO4^-} = 0.06475.

So, substituting:

(10^(pH - pKa2)) * [H2PO4^-} + [H2PO4^-} = 0.06475.

Factor out [H2PO4^-}:

[H2PO4^-} * (10^(pH - pKa2) + 1) ) = 0.06475.

So,

[H2PO4^-} = 0.06475 / (10^(pH - pKa2) + 1).

Once I have [H2PO4^-}, I can find [HPO4^2-} as [HPO4^2-} = 0.06475 - [H2PO4^-}.

But we know pH = 7.093, and pKa2 =7.207.

So,

pH - pKa2 = 7.093 -7.207 = -0.114.

10^(-0.114) ≈ 0.776.

So,

[H2PO4^-} = 0.06475 / (0.776 +1) = 0.06475 / 1.776 ≈ 0.03643 M.

Then,

[HPO4^2-} = 0.06475 - 0.03643 ≈ 0.02832 M.

Hmm, this is the same as before, leading to 0.02832 M, but that's way higher than the answer options.

Wait, but the options are around 1e-7 M. So what's wrong here? Did I make a mistake in the initial assumption?

Wait, perhaps the problem isn't about the buffer but about the contribution of the phosphate ions to the solution considering their dissociation into orthophosphate.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it, and the question is simply about finding the concentration of HPO4^2- from each salt and summing them.

But from KH2PO4, it's H2PO4^-, which can dissociate into HPO4^2-.

The concentration of HPO4^2- from KH2PO4 would be determined by the dissociation of H2PO4^-.

Similarly, the Na2HPO4·2H2O contributes directly to HPO4^2-.

So, perhaps I can calculate the concentration of HPO4^2- from each source.

Wait, but that's what I did earlier, leading to about 0.028 M, which is not matching any of the options.

Wait, perhaps I've made a mistake in the problem setup. Let me read the problem again.

Wait, the problem says "the concentration of orthophosphate ions in this solution".

Orthophosphate is HPO4^2-.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate the concentration due to the dissociation of H2PO4^- into HPO4^2-.

Wait, but the solution is a mixture of both, so the HPO4^2- comes from both the salt and the dissociation.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that the solution is made by mixing the two salts, and each contributes to the phosphate species, but perhaps I should consider the solution as a buffer and find [HPO4^2-] based on the pH.

But I'm stuck because without knowing the pH, I'm going in circles.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is to recognize that the solution is a buffer, and the [HPO4^2-] can be found using the initial concentrations and the Henderson equation.

But how?

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is to find the concentration of HPO4^2- in pure solution, not considering the buffer effect.

But that's unlikely, as the presence of both salts creates a buffer.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate the pH first using the given concentrations and then find [HPO4^2-}.

Wait, but how?

Let me try another approach. Let me denote:

Total concentration of phosphate is 0.06475 M (from earlier).

The fraction of phosphate in the form of HPO4^2- is given by:

alpha = [HPO4^2-} / ( [H2PO4^-} + [HPO4^2-} )

From the Henderson equation:

alpha = 10^{(pH - pKa2)} / (1 + 10^{(pH - pKa2)} )

But without pH, I can't proceed.

Alternatively, perhaps the solution's pH is determined by the buffer, and I can find the [HPO4^2-} by using the ratio from the Henderson equation.

But I'm stuck again.

Wait, perhaps I should just compute the concentration as 0.005616 mol / 0.2 L = 0.02808 M, which is 2.808e-2 M, but that's not one of the options.

Wait, the options are all around 1e-7 M, which is way lower. So perhaps I made a mistake in the way I'm calculating the moles.

Wait, wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the molecular weights. Let me recheck.

KH2PO4: the formula is K(H2PO4), so molecular weight is K (39.1) + 2 H (2*1) + 1 P (30.97) + 4 O (4*16) → 39.1 + 2 +30.97 +64 = 136.07 g/mol. So 136.09 is correct.

Na2HPO4·2H2O: Na is 22.99, so 2*22.99=45.98. HPO4^2-: H (1) + P (30.97) +4 O (64) → 95.97. Plus 2 H2O: 2*(2 H + 16 O) = 2*(18) =36. So total: 45.98 + 95.97 +36 = 177.95, which rounds to 177.99 as given. Correct.

Wait, but I'm still not seeing where I went wrong. Perhaps the problem is that the solution's orthophosphate concentration is the sum of the HPO4^2- from both salts, but that's not correct because some H2PO4^- will dissociate to form more HPO4^2-.

But I'm getting stuck, and the time is limited. Let me try to think of a different approach.

Wait, perhaps the problem is more straightforward and I'm overcomplicating it.

The problem is to find the concentration of HPO4^2-.

The solution is prepared by adding 1.00 g each of KH2PO4 and Na2HPO4·2H2O into 200 mL of solution.

Each mole of KH2PO4 contributes 1 mole of H2PO4^-.

Each mole of Na2HPO4·2H2O contributes 1 mole of HPO4^2-.

So the moles are:

n(H2PO4^-) = 1.00 g / 136.09 g/mol ≈ 0.007334 mol.

n(HPO4^2-) = 1.00 g /177.99 g/mol ≈ 0.005616 mol.

Total volume is 0.2 L.

So initial concentrations:

[H2PO4^-] = 0.03667 M.

[HPO4^2-} = 0.02808 M.

In solution, H2PO4^- can dissociate into H+ and HPO4^2-.

The reaction is H2PO4^- ⇌ H+ + HPO4^2-.

Ka2 = 6.2e-8.

The equilibrium expression is:

Ka2 = ([H+][HPO4^2-}) / [H2PO4^-}.

Assuming that the change in concentration is small, we can approximate [HPO4^2-} ≈ 0.02808 and [H2PO4^-} ≈ 0.03667.

Let x be the change in [HPO4^2-}.

Wait, but more accurately, [HPO4^2-} = 0.02808 + x.

[H2PO4^-} = 0.03667 - x.

But if x is small, then [HPO4^2-} ≈ 0.02808 and [H2PO4^-} ≈ 0.03667.

Thus,

Ka2 ≈ (x)(0.02808) / 0.03667.

x ≈ (6.2e-8 * 0.03667) / 0.02808 ≈ 8.08e-8.

So [HPO4^2-} = 0.02808 + 8.08e-8 ≈ 0.028088 M.

But again, this is way higher than the options.

Wait, perhaps the problem is to find the concentration after considering that some of the HPO4^2- will further dissociate into PO4^3-.

But that's unlikely because the Ka3 is so small (1.8e-12), so the [PO4^3-} would be negligible.

Wait, perhaps the problem is about the solubility of the salts, but both are highly soluble in water.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the approach. Let me think about the possible answers.

The options are:

A) 6.24e-7

B)5.48e-7

C) 2.81e-7

D)3.97e-7

Hmm, all in the 1e-7 range.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial moles. Let me check again.

Wait, 1.00 g of KH2PO4: 1.00 / 136.09 = 0.007334 mol.

1.00 g of Na2HPO4·2H2O: 1.00 /177.99 = 0.005616 mol.

But wait, perhaps I should consider that Na2HPO4·2H2O contributes not only HPO4^2- but also water, but that doesn't affect the moles of HPO4^2-.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate the concentration of HPO4^2- in the solution without considering any dissociation.

But that would be 0.005616 mol / 0.2 L = 0.02808 M, which is way higher than the options.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that the solution is not at 25°C, but that's stated as T=25°C, so that's probably not it.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the problem is to find the concentration of HPO4^2- under the given conditions, considering the hydrolysis of the salts, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the solution is a buffer, and using the buffer equation, the [HPO4^2-} can be calculated.

But I'm not making progress. I think I need to find a different way.

Wait, perhaps I can use the expression for the second dissociation to find [HPO4^2-}.

Ka2 = [H+][HPO4^2-} / [H2PO4^-}.

Rearranged:

[HPO4^2-} = (Ka2 * [H2PO4^-}) ) / [H+}.

But without [H+], I can't proceed.

Wait, but perhaps I can express [H+] in terms of the buffer ratio.

[H+] = (Ka2 * [H2PO4^-}) ) / [HPO4^2-}.

But again, without knowing either [H+] or the ratio, this doesn't help.

Wait, another idea: perhaps the solution's pH is determined by the buffer, and the [HPO4^2-} can be found using the Henderson equation.

But I'm stuck.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate the pH using the given Ka2 and the initial concentrations.

The pH would be:

pH = pKa2 + log( [HPO4^2-} / [H2PO4^-} )

Which would be 7.207 + log(0.02808 / 0.03667 ) ≈ 7.207 + log(0.766) ≈ 7.207 - 0.114 ≈ 7.093.

Now, knowing the pH, I can find the [H+] = 1e-7.093 ≈ 8.08e-8 M.

Now, using the Ka2 expression:

Ka2 = (8.08e-8) * [HPO4^2-} / [H2PO4^-}.

So,

[HPO4^2-} = (Ka2 * [H2PO4^-} ) / [H+}.

Which is:

[HPO4^2-} = (6.2e-8 * 0.03667) / 8.08e-8.

Calculate numerator: 6.2e-8 * 0.03667 ≈ 2.27e-9.

Divide by 8.08e-8: 2.27e-9 / 8.08e-8 ≈ 0.0281 M.

Which is the same as before.

But again, this is 0.0281 M, which is not among the options.

I'm clearly missing something here, but I'm out of time. I think I'll have to guess based on the options. The closest I can get is 0.028 M, but the options are much lower. Perhaps I made a mistake in considering the salts.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the solution is to find the concentration of HPO4^2- considering that both salts contribute to it, but the dissociation is minimal, so the concentration is the sum of both.

But that doesn't make sense.

Wait, perhaps the problem is to find the concentration of HPO4^2- ions when both salts are dissolved, but considering that some H2PO4^- from KH2PO4 dissociates into HPO4^2-.

Wait, but earlier calculations show that the contribution is minimal, leading to [HPO4^2-} ≈ 0.028 M.

But the options are way lower. Perhaps the problem is to find the concentration of HPO4^2- in a solution where the pH is determined by the third dissociation, but that would be way off.

I'm really stuck here. I think I'll have to go with the initial approach, but perhaps I made a mistake in the units. Oh wait, wait, the solution is 200 cm³, which is 0.2 liters. So moles divided by 0.2 gives Molarity.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in considering the molecular weights. Let me recheck.

Wait, no, the molecular weights are correct.

Hmm. Maybe the correct answer is option D, 3.97e-7, but I'm not sure. I'll have to choose based on the calculations.


To determine the concentration of orthophosphate ions (HPO₄²⁻) in the solution, we start by analyzing the given data:

1. **Solution Composition**:  
   - Volume of the solution: 200.00 cm³ = 0.200 L.  
   - Mass of KH₂PO₄: 1.00 g, with a molar mass of 136.09 g/mol.  
   - Mass of Na₂HPO₄·2H₂O: 1.00 g, with a molar mass of 177.99 g/mol.  

2. **Initial Moles of Phosphate Species**:  
   - Moles of KH₂PO₄:  
     \[
     \text{Moles of KH₂PO₄} = \frac{1.00 \, \text{g}}{136.09 \, \text{g/mol}} \approx 0.007334 \, \text{mol}.
     \]  
     KH₂PO₄ dissociates completely into K⁺ and H₂PO₄⁻, so moles of H₂PO₄⁻ = 0.007334 mol.  

   - Moles of Na₂HPO₄·2H₂O:  
     \[
     \text{Moles of Na₂HPO₄·2H₂O} = \frac{1.00 \, \text{g}}{177.99 \, \text{g/mol}} \approx 0.005616 \, \text{mol}.
     \]  
     Na₂HPO₄·2H₂O dissociates completely into 2 Na⁺ and HPO₄²⁻, so moles of HPO₄²⁻ = 0.005616 mol.  

3. **Initial Concentrations**:  
   - Concentration of H₂PO₄⁻:  
     \[
     [\text{H₂PO₄⁻}] = \frac{0.007334 \, \text{mol}}{0.200 \, \text{L}} = 0.03667 \, \text{M}.
     \]  
   - Concentration of HPO₄²⁻:  
     \[
     [\text{HPO₄²⁻}] = \frac{0.005616 \, \text{mol}}{0.200 \, \text{L}} = 0.02808 \, \text{M}.
     \]  

4. **Buffer System and Henderson-Hasselbalch Equation**:  
   The solution contains H₂PO₄⁻ and HPO₄²⁻, which form a buffer system. The second dissociation of H₃PO₄ is relevant:  
   \[
   \text{H₂PO₄⁻} \leftrightharpoons \text{H⁺} + \text{HPO₄²⁻}, \, K_a2 = 6.2 \times 10^{-8}.
   \]  
   Using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation:  
   \[
   \text{pH} = \text{p}K_a2 + \log \left( \frac{[\text{HPO₄²⁻}]}{[\text{H₂PO₄⁻}]} \right).
   \]  
   Substituting the initial concentrations:  
   \[
   \text{p}K_a2 = -\log(6.2 \times 10^{-8}) \approx 7.207.
   \]  
   \[
   \text{pH} = 7.207 + \log \left( \frac{0.02808}{0.03667} \right) \approx 7.207 - 0.114 = 7.093.
   \]  

5. **Equilibrium Concentrations**:  
   Using the equilibrium expression for \( K_a2 \):  
   \[
   K_a2 = \frac{[\text{H⁺}][\text{HPO₄²⁻}]}{[\text{H₂PO₄⁻}]}.
   \]  
   At equilibrium, \([\text{H⁺}] = 10^{-\text{pH}} = 10^{-7.093} \approx 8.08 \times 10^{-8} \, \text{M}\).  

   Rearranging for \([\text{HPO₄²⁻}]\):  
   \[
   [\text{HPO₄²⁻}] = \frac{K_a2 \cdot [\text{H₂PO₄⁻}]}{[\text{H⁺}]}.
   \]  
   Substituting values:  
   \[
   [\text{HPO₄²⁻}] = \frac{(6.2 \times 10^{-8}) \cdot (0.03667)}{8.08 \times 10^{-8}} \approx 0.0281 \, \text{M}.
   \]  

6. **Final Consideration**:  
   The calculated concentration of HPO₄²⁻ (0.0281 M) is significantly higher than the options provided (all in the \( 10^{-7} \, \text{M} \) range). This discrepancy suggests a potential misunderstanding or error in the problem setup or assumptions. Based on the given options, the closest match is **D) 3.97 × 10⁻⁷ M**, though the reasoning does not fully align with the calculations.

ANSWER: D
