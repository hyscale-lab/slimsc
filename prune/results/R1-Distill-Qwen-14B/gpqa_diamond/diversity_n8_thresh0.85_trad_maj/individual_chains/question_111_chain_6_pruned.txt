Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me take a deep breath and think through each part carefully.

The question has two reactions, A and B, and I need to determine the major products for each. Then choose the correct option from A to D.

First reaction: 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one + ethyl acrylate (with t-BuOK) gives product A.

Second reaction: 1-nitropropane + KOH, (E)-but-2-enenitrile, H2O gives product B.

Hmm, okay, let's tackle each reaction one by one.

Starting with reaction A. The starting material is 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one. So the structure is a cyclohexane ring with a ketone at position 1. The substituents are at positions 2 (ethyl) and 6 (methyl). Wait, wait, 2 and 6 positions on a cyclohexane. Let me sketch this mentally. The carbonyl is at position 1, so the ring is numbered such that the carbonyl is at 1, and then positions 2 and 6 are adjacent to it. So 2-ethyl and 6-methyl. Wait, but wait, 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one. Oh wait, no, the substituents are 2-ethyl, and 6-methyl? Or wait, perhaps it's 2-ethyl and 2,6-dimethyl? Wait, the formula says 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one. So, two methyl groups at positions 2 and 6, and an ethyl group at position 2 as well? Maybe that's not possible. Wait, no. Wait, 2-ethyl and 6-dimethyl? Or 2,6-dimethyl and also an ethyl at position 2? Hmm, perhaps the structure is a cyclohexanone ring where position 1 is the keto group. Positions 2 has an ethyl group, and positions 2 and 6 each have a methyl group. Wait, but that would mean position 2 has both ethyl and methyl? No, wait, no, the substituents are 2-ethyl, 2-methyl, and 6
