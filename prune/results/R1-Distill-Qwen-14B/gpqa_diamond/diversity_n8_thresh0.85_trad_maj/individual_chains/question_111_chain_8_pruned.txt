Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question is about. The problem involves two different reactions, and I need to determine the major products A and B from each. Then, I have to choose the correct option from the given choices.

The first reaction is between 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one and ethyl acrylate in the presence of t-BuOK. The second reaction is between 1-nitropropane and a mixture of KOH, (E)-but-2-enenitrile, and water. 

Let me tackle each part one by one.

Starting with reaction A: 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one reacting with ethyl acrylate under basic conditions (t-BuOK). Hmm, I think this is a Michael addition or some kind of conjugate addition. Wait, t-BuOK is a strong, bulky base, so maybe it's a Claisen or aldol condensation? Alternatively, since ethyl acrylate is an alpha, beta-unsaturated ester, it might undergo a conjugate addition (Michael addition) with the cyclohexanone.

Wait, Michael addition is a nucleophilic addition to an alpha, beta-unsaturated carbonyl. But in this case, the cyclohexanone is the carbonyl, and the ethyl acrylate is the Michael donor? Or the acceptor? Let me think. The Michael addition typically involves a nucleophile attacking the beta position of an alpha, beta-unsaturated carbonyl. So maybe the cyclohexanone is the acceptor, and ethyl acrylate is the donor? Or vice versa.

Wait, no, the Michael donor is usually a nucleophile (like enolates) attacking the acceptor, which is the alpha-beta unsaturated carbonyl. So if the cyclohexanone is the acceptor, perhaps the base deprotonates ethyl acrylate to form an enolate, which then attacks the cyclohexanone.

Wait, but another thought: The cyclohexanone might undergo enolate formation under strong base. t-BuOK is a strong base, so it could deprotonate the cyclohexanone to form an enolate. Then, the enolate would attack the ethyl acrylate, which is an alpha-beta unsaturated ester. So the enolate would perform a conjugate addition.

Alternatively, maybe the reaction is a Claisen-like addition. Let me think about the structure of 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one. The carbonyl is at position 1, so the cyclohexane ring has substituents at positions 2 (ethyl and methyl) and 6 (methyl). So positions 2 and 6 are both substituted. The 2 position has an ethyl and a methyl group, making it quite bulky.

When the base (t-BuOK) deprotonates the cyclohexanone, where would the enolate form? The alpha positions are adjacent to the carbonyl, so in this case, positions 2 and 6 are adjacent to carbonyl (position 1). But wait, the carbonyl is at position 1, so the adjacent positions are 2 and 6. Now, the 2 position is already substituted with ethyl and methyl groups, making it more hindered. So the base would prefer to deprotonate the less hindered position, which is position 6. Because position 2 is more substituted, the enolate would form at position 6 if possible. Or wait, perhaps position 2 is more hindered, so the base would choose the less hindered position, perhaps position 3 or 5? No, wait, the carbonyl is at position 1, so the adjacent carbons are 2 and 6. Let me draw the structure.

Structure of 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one: The carbonyl is at C1. C2 has an ethyl and a methyl substituent. C
