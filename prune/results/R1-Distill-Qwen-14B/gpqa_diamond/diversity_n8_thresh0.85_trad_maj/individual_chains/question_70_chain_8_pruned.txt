Okay, let's try to work through this problem. It's a chemistry question, and I need to figure out the molecular symmetry group of product E. Hmm, symmetry groups... I remember those from my studies, but I need to think carefully.

So, the question has several reactions. Let's break them down step by step.

First reaction: Solid A reacts with 8 equivalents of gas B to form bright red product C. Wait, 8 equivalents suggests that the molar ratio is 1:8, maybe. So, perhaps A is a metal, and B is a halogen or something that can form a compound in an 8:1 ratio. But I'm not sure yet.

Then, C reacts with 2 equivalents of gas D to produce E, which is extremely hazardous. Hmm, dangerous products... Maybe something like a nerve agent or a toxic gas? But I'm not certain. Let me think about the next clue.

C reacts with water to reform A plus two different acids F and G. F is a strong acid, G is a weak acid. So when C is hydrolyzed, it gives back A and two acids. Strong and weak acids. Maybe F is HCl (strong) and G is maybe H2S or something? Or perhaps another combination. Wait, but if A is a metal, maybe C is a metal compound that when hydrolyzed gives back the metal and two acids. Like, if A is a metal oxide or something. Wait, but the product is C, which is red. Bright red... Maybe a transition metal compound. Like maybe Co or Mn?

Wait, let's think about the reactions again. So A + 8 B → C. Let's think of possible reactions. Maybe A is a metal, and B is Cl2? Because sometimes metals react with Cl2 in certain ratios. But 8 equivalents would be a high ratio. Wait, 8 moles of Cl2 per mole of A. That's a lot. Alternatively, maybe B is O2? Or maybe another diatomic gas.

But wait, another reaction: C reacting with D and water. Let me think about the next part: D reacts with B in 1:1 ratio to form H, which is a solvent. Common solvents include H2O, maybe something like ethanol, but B is a gas. So what reacts with B (a gas) in a 1:1 ratio to form a solvent? Let's think. If B is Cl2, then D could be something like NH3 (but ammonia is a gas, but perhaps it's another gas). Wait, if B is Cl2, then D could be something that when combined with Cl2 would form a solvent. Alternatively, if B is O2, D might be H2, forming H2O as the solvent. But H2O is a solvent. Alternatively, if B is F2, D could be something else.

Wait, another approach: Let's think about product E. It's formed when C reacts with D. Then, D reacts with B in 1:1 to form H, a solvent. So H is a solvent made from D and B. Let's think about common solvents. For example, water (H2O) is a solvent. So if H is H2O, then B and D must form H2O. So B and D would be H2 and O2, but their ratio is 1:1. Because H2O is formed from 2 H2 and O2 in a 1:1 ratio. Wait, the reaction is 2 H2 + O2 → 2 H2O. So in that case, the molar ratio is 2:1 for H2 to O2. But the problem says D and B react in a 1:1 ratio to form H. Hmm, doesn't fit. Alternatively, maybe B is H2 and D is O2? No, that would give H2O again with a 2:1 ratio.

Wait another thought: Maybe H is something like NH3? But then B and D would have to combine to form NH3. For example, if B is N2 and D is H2. The reaction would be N2 + 3H2 → 2 NH3. So in that case, the ratio is 1:3, but the problem says 1:1. Hmm, not matching.

Wait, perhaps H is a different solvent. Like maybe CH3OH (methanol) or another alcohol. But that would require B and D to combine in a 1:1 ratio. Alternatively, H could be something like HF, but that's a gas, not a solvent. Or maybe H is CO2? No, that's a gas.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let's think of H as a common solvent. Water is a good candidate. So if H is H2O, then B and D must combine in a 1:1 ratio to form H2O.

Wait, but H2O is H2O. To make H2O, you need 2 H and 1 O. So if B is O2 and D is H2, then H2 + O2 → H2O. But the molar ratio would be 2:1 for H2 to O2. But the problem states D and B are in a 1:1 ratio. So that doesn't fit.

Another possibility
