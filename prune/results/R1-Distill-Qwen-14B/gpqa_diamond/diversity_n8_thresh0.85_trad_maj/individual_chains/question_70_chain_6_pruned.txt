Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem in front of me, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of these reaction mechanisms. Let me try to break it down step by step.

First, the problem describes a series of reactions. Let me list out what each part says and see if I can figure out the substances involved.

The first reaction: Solid A reacts with 8 equivalents of gas B to form product C. The product C is bright red. Hmm, bright red makes me think of something like sulfur, but wait, maybe it's another compound. Alternatively, could it be a transition metal compound? Let me think. Oh, wait, maybe it's a reaction involving sulfur. Wait, another thought: when I mix a metal with a gas, like sulfur vapor, perhaps forming a sulfide. But I'm not sure yet.

Moving on. The second reaction: C reacts with 2 equivalents of gas D to produce product E, which is extremely hazardous. So, what's E? Maybe something like sulfur trioxide (but that's SO3), but wait, let's think about the reactions. If C is a sulfide, reacting with D (another gas) to form a hazardous product. Alternatively, maybe C is a metal oxide? Let's hold that thought.

Third reaction: C reacts with water to reform A and two different acids F and G. F is a strong acid, G is a weak acid. So, when C is treated with water, it breaks down into A plus two acids. Strong and weak. What reactions produce two acids? Maybe something like the hydrolysis of a sulfide? Wait, when a sulfide (like FeS) reacts with water, it might produce H2S and maybe another acid. Or wait, more likely, if C is a metal sulfide, perhaps when it reacts with water, it can form a corresponding metal hydroxide (which might not be stable) or perhaps a metal oxide. Wait, no, because it's reacting with water to form A. So, perhaps C is a metal oxide. Let me think: for example, if A is a metal, B is, say, oxygen gas. Then C would be the oxide of A. But, wait, the first reaction uses 8 equivalents of B. Hmm, that's a lot. For example, maybe A is Fe, and B is O2. If Fe reacts with O2 in a certain condition, perhaps forming Fe3O4? Which has Fe in both +2 and +3 oxidation states. Wait, but Fe3O4 is actually a mix of FeO·Fe2O3, but I'm not sure if that's relevant here.

Alternatively, let's think about the number of equivalents. Solid A reacting with 8 equivalents of B. So, if B is O2, and A is, say, sulfur, but that might not fit. Alternatively, if A is a metal that forms an oxide with a high oxidation state. Let me think about the first reaction: 8 equivalents is a lot. So maybe A is Fe, and B is Cl2? Hmm, but that might not fit the color.

Wait, let me think about the product C. It's bright red. What compounds are bright red? Maybe a nitrate or something else. Wait, iron(III) oxide is reddish, but I'm not sure if it's bright red. Alternatively, perhaps C is a sulfide. No, sulfides are usually black or yellow. Wait, could it be a copper compound? Copper(II) sulfate solution is blue. Hmm.

Wait, another approach: the first reaction, solid A with 8 equivalents of B. Let's think stoichiometry. 8 equivalents could mean 8 moles of B per mole of A. So, if B is a diatomic gas, like O2, then 8 equivalents would mean 8 moles of O2 per mole of A.

Wait, let's think about the formula of the product C. If A is a metal M and B is O2, then M reacts with O2 to form MO4? Hmm, maybe not. Let me think of the possible oxide. Alternatively, maybe A is sulfur (S), and B is O2? Then C could be SO3? But that's a gas, but the product C is a solid because it's reacting further. Alternatively, maybe C is a metal oxide.

Alternatively, maybe it's a reaction where the metal is reacting with a halogen. For example, if B is Cl2, then A could be a metal reacting to form a chloride. But then, I need to think about the color. For example, FeCl3 is yellow, not bright red. Hmm.

Wait, looking at the third reaction: when C reacts with water, it produces A and two different acids F and G. One strong, one weak. So, if C is a sulfide, maybe the reaction is C + H2O → A + H2S (weak acid) and another acid. Wait, but H2S is a weak acid, and if another acid is formed, maybe a strong acid like H2SO4? Or wait, perhaps C is a nitride? Let's think: if C is a nitride, like Mg3N2, then adding H2O would produce NH3 and Mg(OH)2. But NH3 is a weak base, not an acid. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps C is a metal oxide. For example, if C is Al2O3, then reacting with water would produce Al(OH)3, which is a weak acid? No, Al(OH)3 is amphoteric. Hmm, not sure.

Wait, another angle: the second reaction. C reacts with 2 equivalents of D to form E, which is extremely hazardous. So, E could be a highly toxic gas, perhaps. For example, HCl gas is toxic, but maybe something more dangerous like HCN or SO2? Or perhaps a metal cyanide? Alternatively, maybe E is something like phosgene, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps D is a halogen, like Cl2. So, if C is a metal oxide, reacting with Cl2 would form a chloride and possibly some other compound. Wait, but if C is a metal oxide, say FeO, and D is Cl2, then FeO + Cl2 → maybe something else
