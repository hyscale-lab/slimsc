Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. I'm a bit rusty, but let's try to think it through. The question is about synthesizing a specific compound starting from benzene. The target molecule is 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene. Hmm, that's a mouthful. Let me break down the structure.

So, the benzene ring has three substituents: a tert-butyl group, an ethoxy group, and a nitro group. The positions are 1, 2, and 3. Wait, benzene numbering is a bit tricky. Let me visualize the numbering. If the positions are 1, 2, 3, then the substituents are adjacent in a way. Wait, no, in benzene, 1,2,3 would form a meta arrangement, but maybe I'm getting that wrong. Let me just think about it as the substituents being at specific positions.

Wait, the target is 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene. So, the positions are 1, 2, 3. So substituents at positions 1 (ethoxy), 2 (tert-butyl), and 3 (nitro). Let me sketch this mentally. Position 1 is ethoxy, position 2 is tert-butyl, and position 3 is nitro. So they are each adjacent, like a chain around the ring. So the substituents are in positions 1,2,3 in a clockwise direction, making a 1,2,3-trisubstituted benzene.

So the synthesis steps need to introduce these groups in some order, considering the directing effects of each group. Since benzene is the starting material, we'll need to do electrophilic substitutions.

Let me think about the substituents and their directing effects. The tert-butyl group is a strong activating, o/p-directing group because it's an alkyl group. Ethoxy is also activating, o/p-directing, but wait, actually, ethoxy is an activating group (since it's an electron-donating group) and o/p-directing. Nitro is a strong deactivating, m-directing group.

But wait, the order in which we add these groups matters because each group will direct the incoming substituents. So we need to plan the order of reactions to ensure each new group is added in the correct position.
