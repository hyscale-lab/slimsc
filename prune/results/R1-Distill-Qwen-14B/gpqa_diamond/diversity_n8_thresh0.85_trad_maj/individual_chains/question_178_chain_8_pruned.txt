Okay, so I've got this problem here about Lagrangians and renormalizability. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, but let me think it through.

The question gives me the Lagrangian: L_int = κ ψ̄ σ_{μν} ψ F^{μν}, and σ_{μν} is defined as (i/2)[γ_μ, γ_ν]. I need to find the mass dimension of κ and determine if the theory is renormalizable.

First, I remember that in quantum field theory, the mass dimension of a coupling constant determines whether the interaction is renormalizable. If the dimension is positive, the theory is renormalizable. If it's negative, it's not. Wait, no, wait. Let me get that straight. I think the rule is that a renormalizable interaction has a coupling with mass dimension ≤ 3. Or is it the opposite? Wait, no, the dimension of the coupling is determined by the power of the field, and for the interaction term to have a certain dimension, the coupling's dimension is set so that the whole term is dimension 4, because the Lagrangian has to have mass dimension 4 (since the action is dimensionless, and integrating over d^4x which is dimension 4).

So each term in the Lagrangian must have mass dimension 4. So for L_int = κ ψ̄ σ_{μν} ψ F^{μν}, each field and coupling contributes to the mass dimension.

Let me break down each part.

ψ is a Dirac spinor. I remember that in 4 dimensions, the Dirac spinor ψ has mass dimension 3/2. Because the Dirac equation is (iγ^μ ∂_μ - m)ψ = 0. The derivative ∂_μ has dimension 1, and m is mass dimension 1. So ψ must have dimension 3/2 to balance the terms.

So ψ̄ (which is ψ† γ^0) also has dimension 3/2.

Now, σ_{μν} is (i/2)[γ_μ, γ_ν], which is a commutator of gamma matrices. The gamma matrices themselves are dimensionless, so σ_{μν} is dimensionless as well.

F^{μν} is the field strength tensor for electromagnetism (I think, since F is antisymmetric and built from derivatives of the gauge field A). The field tensor F_{μν} is ∂_μ A_ν - ∂_ν A_μ. Each A has mass dimension 1, because the covariant derivative is D_mu = partial_mu + i e A_mu, and partial has dim 1, so A must have dim 1. So F, being derivatives of A, would have dimension 2.

Wait, no. Let me think again. The field strength F_{μν} is (∂_μ A_ν - ∂_ν A_mu). Each A has dimension 1, each derivative adds 1, so each term in F has dimension 2. So F^{μν} has dimension 2.

Putting it all together, the term κ ψ̄ σ ψ F has the product of the fields and κ. Let's compute the dimension.

ψ̄ σ ψ: each ψ is 3/2, and σ is dimensionless. So ψ̄ σ ψ has dimension 3/2 + 3/2 = 3.

Then multiply by F^{μν}, which is dimension 2. So 3 + 2 = 5.

So the term κ multiplied by ψ̄σψ F gives a term with dimension [κ] + 5. But the Lagrangian must have dimension 4. So [κ] +5 =4 → [κ] = -1.

So the mass dimension of κ is -1.

Now, the next part is whether the theory is renormalizable. I remember that a theory is renormalizable if all the coupling constants have positive or zero mass dimension. Because if a coupling has a negative mass dimension, it's a dimensionful coupling, leading to an effective theory that needs a cutoff, implying it's not renormalizable.

Wait, but wait. The dimension of the coupling is determined by the term in the Lagrangian. For the interaction term to have the correct dimension, the coupling's dimension is set accordingly. For renormalizability, the coupling's dimension must be non-negative. Because if it's negative, the coupling becomes strong at high energies, leading to non-renormalizable interactions.

So here, [κ]=-1, which is negative. So the theory would not be renormalizable because the coupling has a negative mass dimension. That would mean it's not renormalizable.

So looking at the options:

Option A: [κ]=-1, renormalizable. No, because negative implies not renormalizable.

Option B: [κ]=1, renormalizable. But we found [κ]=-1.

Option C: [κ]=-1, not renormalizable. Yes.
