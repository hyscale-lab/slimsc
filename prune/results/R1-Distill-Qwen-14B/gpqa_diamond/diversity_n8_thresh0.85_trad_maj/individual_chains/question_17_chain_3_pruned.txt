Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of these kinds of questions. Let me read it again and try to break it down.

The question is about finding the concentration of calcium ions in a solution. The solution contains 0.02 M of a stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex. The pH is ideal, and the temperature is 25 degrees Celsius. The given K for the Ca-EDTA complex is 5x10^10. The options are A to D, each with different concentrations.

Hmm, I remember that EDTA is a chelating agent. It binds metal ions like Ca²+ in a 1:1 ratio. So, the Ca-EDTA complex is a stable species, right? The K here is the formation constant, which tells us how stable the complex is.

Wait, the problem says it's a stoichiometric solution. So the concentration of the Ca-EDTA complex is 0.02 M. But wait, when EDTA binds Ca²+, it's in a 1:1 ratio, so the concentration of the complex [CaEDTA²-] is 0.02 M. But the question is asking about [Ca²+], the free calcium ions.

Oh right, because the formation constant K is the equilibrium between the metal ion and the EDTA. The K is given as 5e10, which is a very large number, indicating that the complex is very stable. So the concentration of free Ca²+ should be really low.

The formation reaction is: Ca²+ + EDTA^4- ↔ CaEDTA²-.

The formation constant K is [CaEDTA²-] / ([Ca²+][EDTA^4-]).

Wait, but in this case, the solution is 0.02 M Ca-EDTA. So [CaEDTA²-] is 0.02 M. But what about the EDTA and Ca²+ concentrations?

I think I need to consider that in solution, some of the EDTA might be in different protonated forms. Oh wait, the problem says the pH is ideal. EDTA is a polyprotic acid, and at a certain pH, it exists mainly in the Y^4- form, which is the one that binds the metals. So I can assume that the concentration of EDTA^4- is approximately equal to the total EDTA concentration, because other forms are negligible. But wait, wait. The problem gives K_Ca-EDTA, which is the formation
