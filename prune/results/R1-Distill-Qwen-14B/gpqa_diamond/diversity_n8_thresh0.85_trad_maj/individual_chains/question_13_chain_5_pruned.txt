Okay, so I'm trying to solve this organic chemistry problem. Let's read it again and break it down step by step.

The starting material is (R)-(+)-Limonene. I remember that limonene is a cyclic monoterpene, specifically a bicyclic monoterpene. Wait, no, limonene is actually a cyclic monoterpene with a structure that's a substituted cyclohexene. Oh right, limonene is the main component in citrus essential oils, like lemon peel. Its structure is a bicyclic monoterpene? Or is it just a cyclohexene derivative? Wait, (R)-limonene is a chiral molecule, so it's a substituted cyclohexene with a specific stereochemistry.

The first step is that the limonene solution is stirred with Pd/C under hydrogen. So that's hydrogenation. Since Pd/C is a catalyst, this is probably a hydrogenation reaction. The question says after 1 equivalent of hydrogen is consumed. So limonene has a double bond, which would be hydrogenated.

Limonene has a structure where a cyclohexene ring is connected to a methyl group and another substituent. The structure of (R)-limonene is such that the double bond is between C1 and C2, with a methyl group at C2 and another substituent. Wait, maybe it's better to think of limonene as having a structure where there's a cyclohexene ring with substituents.

So hydrogenation of limonene would add hydrogen across the double bond. Since limonene is (R) configuration, the product after hydrogenation would be a cyclohexane derivative. Let me imagine the structure: after hydrogenation, the double bond becomes a single bond, so the ring becomes cyclohexane. So product 1 is the hydrogenated form of limonene.

Wait, limonene is a bicyclic monoterpene? No, I think it's a monocyclic monoterpene. Let me recall: limonene is a substituted cyclohexene with a specific configuration. Its structure is a cyclohexene ring with a methyl group and another substituent (maybe an isopropyl group), but I need to get the structure right.

Alternatively, limonene is (R)-5-methyl-2-(1-methylethenyl)cyclohexanone or something similar? Hmm, perhaps I should think of limonene's structure. Oh wait, limonene is actually 1-methyl-4-(1-methylethenyl)cyclohexene. So it's a cyclohexene ring with a methyl group at C1 and a isopropenyl group (CH2CH(CH3)) at C4, maybe? Or wait, perhaps that's not right. Alternatively, limonene is (R)-5-methyl-2-(1-methylvinyl)bicyclo[2.2.1]hept-2-ene, but maybe that's a different terpene.

Wait, perhaps I should look up limonene's structure. But since I can't do that right now, I'll proceed with what I remember. Limonene is a cyclic monoterpene, and its structure includes a six-membered ring with a double bond. So when hydrogenated, the double bond would be saturated, turning the ring into a cyclohexane.

So product 1 is the hydrogenated limon
