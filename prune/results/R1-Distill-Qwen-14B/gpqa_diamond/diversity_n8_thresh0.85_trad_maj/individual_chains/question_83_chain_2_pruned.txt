Okay, so I have this chemistry problem in front of me, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of titration problems. Let me try to break it down step by step.

Alright, the problem says we're diluting 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid with 20.00 cm³ of water. Then we titrate this diluted solution with 0.1 M NaOH. We need to find the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point. The options are given, and I have to choose the correct one.

First, I think I should figure out the concentration of the acetic acid after dilution. Acetic acid is a weak acid, and when we dilute it, the concentration changes, which will affect how it reacts with NaOH.

So, the initial volume is 20.00 cm³, and after adding 20.00 cm³ of water, the total volume becomes 40.00 cm³. The initial moles of acetic acid can be calculated using Molarity (M) = moles/volume (in liters). Wait, right, moles = Molarity × Volume (in liters). So for the acetic acid before dilution: 0.05 M * 0.02 L = 0.001 moles. Because 20 cm³ is 0.02 liters.

After dilution, the volume is 40 cm³ or 0.04 L. So the new concentration (M2) is moles / new volume. So M2 = 0.001 moles / 0.04 L = 0.025 M. Okay, that makes sense. So the diluted solution is 0.025 M acetic acid.

Now, when we titrate this with NaOH, each mole of NaOH will neutralize a mole of acetic acid. The reaction is: CH3COOH + NaOH → CH3COONa + H2O. So, for each mole of NaOH added, a mole of CH3COOH is converted to CH3COO^-.

The equivalence point is when moles of NaOH equal moles of acetic acid. Let me calculate the moles of acetic acid we have: 0.025 M * 0.04 L = 0.001 moles. So, we need 0.001 moles of NaOH to reach the equivalence point.

The concentration of NaOH is 0.1 M. So the volume needed would be moles / Molarity = 0.001 / 0.1 = 0.01 L, which is 10 cm³. But wait, the question isn't about the volume, but about the pH at 25% titration and at equivalence.

Let me tackle each part one by one.

First, the pH at 25% titration.

25% of the equivalence point means we've added 25% of the required NaOH. Since we need 10 cm³ for equivalence, 25% would be 2.5 cm³.

But wait, when you add NaOH, the amount in moles is important.
