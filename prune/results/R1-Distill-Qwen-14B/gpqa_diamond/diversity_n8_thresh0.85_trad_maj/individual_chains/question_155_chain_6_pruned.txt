Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me start by reading it carefully.

The question is about finding the uncertainty ΔP_z of the operator P_z. I remember that the uncertainty is calculated using the formula ΔP_z = sqrt(⟨P_z²⟩ - ⟨P_z⟩²). So I need to find the expectation values of P_z and P_z squared in the given state.

The system is in an eigenstate of P_x with eigenvalue -ħ. The state is given as a column vector: (-1/2, 1/sqrt(2), -1/2). Wait, actually, the problem says the explicit form is this vector. So I think the state |ψ> is this vector.

The basis vectors are the eigenvectors of P_z. So the matrix representations of P_x, P_y, and P_z are given in this basis. I need to compute the expectation values.

First, I should write down the operator matrices. Let me see:

P_x matrix:
First row: 0, ħ/√2, 0
Second row: ħ/√2, 0, ħ/√2
Third row: 0, ħ/√2, 0

P_y matrix:
First row: 0, -iħ/√2, 0
Second row: iħ/√2, 0, -iħ/√2
Third row: 0, iħ/√2, 0

P_z matrix:
First row: ħ, 0, 0
Second row: 0, 0, 0
Third row: 0, 0, -ħ

So the state |ψ> is a column vector [ -1/2; 1/sqrt(2); -1/2 ].

Wait, but this state is an eigenstate of P_x, right? Because the system is in the eigenstate of P_x with eigenvalue -ħ. Hmm, but let me confirm that. The eigenvalue of P_x is given as -ħ. So that would mean P_x |ψ> = (-ħ) |ψ>.

But maybe I don't need that information right now. Let's get back to computing the uncertainty.

I need to compute ⟨P_z⟩ and ⟨P_z²⟩.

First, let's compute ⟨P_z⟩. That's the expectation value of P_z in state |ψ>.

⟨ψ| P_z |ψ⟩.

The state |ψ> is a column vector, so to compute this, I can either do the matrix multiplication or perhaps recognize that since P_z is diagonal in this basis, the expectation value is just the sum of the diagonal elements multiplied by the probabilities of each eigenstate.

Wait, wait, because |ψ> is expressed in the eigenbasis of P_z. So each component corresponds to the eigenstates of P_z. That makes things easier.

Because in the eigenbasis of an operator, the expectation value is just the weighted sum of the eigenvalues, where the weights are the square of the amplitudes (probabilities).

So P_z has eigenvalues ħ, 0, and -ħ for the first, second, and third basis vectors respectively.

The state |ψ> has components a, b, c, where a = -1/2, b = 1
