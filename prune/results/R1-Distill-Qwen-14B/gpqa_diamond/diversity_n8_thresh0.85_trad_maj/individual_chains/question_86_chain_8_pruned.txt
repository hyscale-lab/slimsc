Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to work through it. Let's see what the question is about.

So, the problem says that a chemist did two reactions. Each reaction used a different reducing agent on an unknown starting material. The products are both 4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one, but one is the R configuration and the other is the S. I need to figure out which starting materials A and B were used for each reaction.

The options give me possible structures for compounds A and B. They are all some sort of isobutoxy substituted oxo acids. Let me jot down the key points.

First, the reactions:

1. A is treated with LiBH4 and H+ to give (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one.
2. B is treated with BH3 and H+ to give (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one.

Wait, but LiBH4 and BH3 are both reducing agents. I remember that LiBH4 is a strong reducing agent, often used to reduce ketones to alcohols. BH3 is usually used with other reagents like THF or in hydroboration reactions. Oh wait, BH3 itself isn't a strong enough reducing agent for ketones, maybe? Or is it used in a different context?

Wait, the product is a ketone, 4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one. So the starting material must have had a carbonyl group which, when reduced, would form an alcohol. Wait, but wait, the product is a ketone, so no, that doesn't make sense. Oh wait a minute, maybe the starting material is a more complex carbonyl compound.

Wait, looking at the product, 4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one. Pyran is a six-membered ring with one oxygen. The 2-one means a ketone at position 2. Position 4 has an ethyl group. So when this is formed from a starting material, perhaps it's from a cyclic ketone or something else.

Wait, but the reaction is a reduction. So if the product is a ketone, that doesn't involve reduction of a carbonyl to an alcohol. Hmm, maybe I'm thinking about this wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is an ester or an acetal. Wait, but wait, the product is a cyclic hemiacetal or something else? Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the starting material is a cyclic ketone ester. Or maybe a lactone? Wait, no, because the product is a pyranone. Pyranone is a cyclic ketone.

Wait, perhaps the starting material is a diethyl acetal or something that can undergo reduction. I'm a bit confused here.

Wait, maybe the starting materials are ketones, and the reducing agents are actually doing some kind of conjugate reduction or something else.

Wait, another approach: the product is a tetrahydro pyranone. So perhaps the starting material is a gamma or delta lactone? Wait, a lactone is an ester, so maybe.

Wait, when a lactone is treated with a reducing agent like LiBH4, would it open up? Let me think. Lactones are cyclic esters. Esters can be reduced by strong reducing agents like LiBH4
