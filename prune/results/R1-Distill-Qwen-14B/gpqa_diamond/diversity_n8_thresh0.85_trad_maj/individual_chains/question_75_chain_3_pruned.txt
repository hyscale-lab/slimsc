Okay, so I'm looking at this problem about a mouse model study involving the GADD45G protein. The researcher is trying to overexpress this protein by introducing a coding sequence with an influenza hemagglutinin tag at the N-terminus. They used Lipofectamine to transfect Chinese hamster ovary cells and selected antibiotic-resistant colonies, but the overexpression didn't happen as expected. The question is why.

The given DNA sequence is the plus strand, so I need to analyze it for possible issues that would prevent the expression of the desired protein.

Let me think about each option:

Option A: The sequence for the antigenic determinant has a missense mutation. Well, the tag is added at the N-terminus. If there's a mutation in the HA tag, maybe the protein won't be recognized for purification. But the main issue here is overexpression, which is about whether the gene is expressed, not whether the protein is detectable. So maybe A isn't the main problem.

Option B: The ribosome terminated the translation early. That suggests a premature stop codon. Let me look for a stop codon in the sequence. The mRNA is read from 5' to 3', so looking for TAA, TAG, or TGA. Let me scan the sequence.

Looking for these triplets:

The sequence starts with ATG, which is the start codon. Let's go through the sequence. There's a TAC, which is Tyrosine, then CAT (His), etc. Hmm. Let me see...

Wait, I should look for any in-frame stop codons. Let's go through the DNA sequence in triplets.

The DNA is in the plus strand, which is the same as the mRNA except T→U. So the mRNA would be AUGC... etc.

Looking through the sequence:

Looking for TAG, TAA, or TGA in the mRNA. So in the DNA, that would be ATG (if it was a start), but as stop codons in DNA would be complementary to the mRNA stops. Wait, actually, the mRNA is the same as the DNA's plus strand, just T→U. So in DNA, the stop codons would be TAA, TAG, TGA.

Looking through the DNA sequence:

The first part is ATG TAC CCA TAC GAT GTT CCAGAT... Let me look for these triplets.

Looking for any occurrence of TAA, TAG, or TGA.

Wait, let's go through the sequence step by step.

The sequence is:

5' ATG TAC CCA TAC GAT GTT CCA GAT TAC GCC AAA TGA CTC TGG AAG AAG TCC GCC GGC CAG GAC ACA GTT CCG GAA AGC ACG CCA GGA TGC AGG GTG CCG GAA AGC GCT GCA GAG TTC GCT GCT GTC GGC GCC AGC GTC AGG GCT GCC TCA CTC GCG CGT GCT ACG AGT CAG CCA AAG TCT TGA ACG TGG ACC CCC GAC AAT GTG ACT TTC TGT GTG CTG GCT GCG GGG TGA GGA GGA CGA GGC GAC ATC GCG CTG CAG ATC CTT TTA CGC ATC CAG GCT TCT GCT GCG AGA ACG ACC ATC GAC ATA GTG CGC GTC GGC GAT GTG CAG CGG CTG GCG GCT ATC GTG GGC GCC GGC GAG GAG GCG GGG TGC GCC GGC GAC CTG CAC TGC ATC CTC ATT TCG AAC CCC CAG GAC GCG CTT GGA AGG ATC CCC CTT GGA GAG CTC AGC CTG TTT TGC GAG GAG AGC GCA GCG TTAA CGA TGG GGT GCC CAG CAT CAC CCT CCCC GAG TGA 3'

Wait, I'm trying to find any in-frame TAA, TAG, or TGA.

Looking for TAA:

I see a part: ... GGA TGC AGG GTG CCG GAA AGC GCT GCA GAG TTC GCT GCT GTC GGC GCC AGC GTC AGG GCT GCC TCA CTC GCG CGT GCT ACG AGT CAG CCA AAG TCT TGA ... Oh, wait, here's TGA in the DNA. So the mRNA would have UGA, which is a stop codon. So the DNA has TGA in the sequence. Let me count where that is.

Looking at the sequence: at some point, it's ... TCT TGA ACG TGG ... So the triplet is TGA in the DNA, which would be UGA in mRNA. So that's a stop codon. So the ORF would terminate early here.

Wait, how many codons before that? Let me count the letters before that TGA.

Wait, let me look again.

The DNA sequence is:

5' ... TCT TGA ACG TGG ... So the triplet is TGA. So the mRNA is UGA, which is a stop codon. So the ribosome would stop at this point, producing a truncated protein.

That's a problem because the construct has a stop codon, leading to early termination.

So why is the stop codon there? Because the HA tag was added at the N-terminus. Wait, the problem states that the construct includes the HA tag at the N-terminus. So the HA tag's coding sequence is added before the GADD45G coding sequence.

Hmm, but in the DNA sequence provided, the HA tag should be at the beginning. So the HA tag's sequence would be before the GADD45G starts.

Wait, perhaps the HA tag is correctly added, but in the provided DNA sequence, there's a TGA early on, which is a stop codon.

So the protein would be truncated, which would prevent overexpression. So the presence of TGA (UGA in mRNA) is causing the ribosome to stop early, resulting in a non-functional or smaller protein.

So the issue is that there's a stop codon in the coding sequence, leading to early termination.

Looking back at the options, option B says the ribosome terminated early. That would be due to encountering a stop codon.

So that's likely the problem. The construct has a premature stop codon leading to the truncation of the protein, hence no overexpression.

Another possibility: the HA tag was inserted but caused
