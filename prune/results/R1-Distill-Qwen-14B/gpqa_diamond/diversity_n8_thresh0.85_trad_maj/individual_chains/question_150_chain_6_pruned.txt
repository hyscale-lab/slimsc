Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because NMR problems can be tricky. But let's take it step by step. The question gives me a compound with the molecular formula C8H9NO and some NMR data. Then, it's reacted through a series of reagents, and I need to find the final product from the options given.

First, I'll try to figure out what the starting compound is based on the NMR data. The molecular formula is C8H9NO. Let's calculate the degree of unsaturation. Each degree is a ring or a double bond. The formula is: Degree of Unsaturation (DoU) = (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. Here, X is 0. So, C=8, H=9, N=1.

DoU = (2*8 +2 -9 +1)/2 = (18-9)/2= (9)/2=4.5? Wait, that can't be right. Oh wait, I think I made a mistake. Let me recalculate. 

Wait, the formula is (2C + 2 - H - X + N)/2. So substituting, 2*8 is 16, +2 is 18. Minus H (9) is 9, plus N (1) is 10. So 18 -9 =9, plus 1 is 10. Oh wait, no, wait. Let me write it correctly: 2C +2 - H - X + N. So 16+2 =18, minus 9 (H) is 9, plus N (1) is 10. So DoU=10/2=5. So five degrees of unsaturation. That could be, say, a benzene ring (which is 3 DoU), a double bond (1), and a couple of rings or other double bonds. Or maybe a benzene and a conjugated system.

Looking at the NMR data: 9.72 ppm is a triplet integrating to 1H. That's a high chemical shift, so probably an aldehyde proton. Aldehydes typically show up around 9-10 ppm. The triplet suggests coupling with two protons, which might be adjacent to a CH2 group.

Then, 6.98 is a doublet integrating to 2H. 6.51 is another doublet of 2H. These look like a pair of aromatic protons, perhaps from a para-substituted benzene. The coupling pattern could be from a di-substituted aromatic, maybe para positions. 

Next, 6.27 is a broad singlet integrating to 2H. Broad singlet could indicate some exchange, maybe an -OH group, but in this case, the integration is 2H. Alternatively, perhaps these are protons adjacent to an oxygen, like in a conjugated system. Hmm.

Then, 3.66 is a doublet integrating to 2H. The chemical shift around 3.6 ppm suggests something deshielded, maybe adjacent to an oxygen or an electronegative atom. The doublet suggests coupling with one neighboring group, perhaps a CH2 next to another CH2.

Putting this together, maybe the structure has a benzene ring with substituents, a conjugated system, and an aldehyde group. Let me think. The aldehyde is probably at one end, then maybe a conjugated double bond, followed by another benzene ring.

Wait, but the molecular formula is C8H9NO. Let me count: if it's an aldehyde, that's CHO. Then, let's see. Maybe the structure is something like benzaldehyde with substituents. But let's try to draw a possible structure.

Looking at the shifts, the triplet at 9.72 ppm is probably the aldehyde proton. Then, the 6.98 and 6.51 doublets suggest a para-substituted benzene, perhaps with substituents at the para positions. Wait, but the integration is 2H each, so maybe a di-substituted benzene. Like a para-substituted with two substituents, each having two protons each. Or perhaps each substituent is an adjacent group.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the aldehyde is at the end of a chain, with a conjugated double bond leading into a benzene ring. For example, like cinnamaldehyde, but with substituents. Or maybe there's an aromatic ring attached to a CH2 group, then a double bond, then another CH2, then the aldehyde.

Wait, let me think about the H at 3.66 ppm, a doublet of 2H. That could be a CH2 group adjacent to another CH2, perhaps in an ethyl group. Wait, but the structure: maybe it's something like Ph-CH2-CH2-CHO? But then, the NMR would have a triplet for the aldehyde (if adjacent to CH2), but in that case, the H on CH2 would be split into a
