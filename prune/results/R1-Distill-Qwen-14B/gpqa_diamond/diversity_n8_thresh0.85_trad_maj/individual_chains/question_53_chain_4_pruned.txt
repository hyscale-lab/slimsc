Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let me read the question again.

The compound is a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring. The FTIR shows ester groups. So, that means there's an ester functional group somewhere. Ester groups have specific absorption bands, like the carbonyl stretching around 1700 cm^-1, I think. So that's a clue.

Now, looking at the 1H NMR spectrum: six signals. Let's break them down. Two aromatic-H signals. Wait, a benzene ring with two substituents is di-substituted. Depending on the substitution pattern, the aromatic protons can have different splitting. If it's para-substituted, you'd have two sets of equivalent protons. Or if it's ortho or meta, but di-substituted can vary. But the NMR shows two signals, so maybe each set is equivalent. So perhaps para substitution, where the two sets are each a pair of equivalent Hs. Alternatively, maybe it's a mono-substituted ring with two substituents in a way that gives two distinct signals, but I'm not sure.

Then there are two vinyl-H signals: one is a doublet, the other a doublet of quartets. Vinyl protons are usually deshielded and appear downfield. A doublet suggests maybe coupling with one neighboring proton. A doublet of quartets is a bit more complex. Quartet implies coupling with a group that has three equivalent protons, like a CH3 group? Or perhaps another set of protons.

Next, two signals for –CH3 groups. So two different methyl groups. And no –CH2 signals. So the compound doesn't have any CH2 groups. That suggests that any CH2 groups are either absent or perhaps in a different environment that doesn't show up as a separate peak. Or maybe they're part of a more complex splitting but are integrated into the existing peaks.

So, putting this together, the compound is an aromatic ring with two substituents, one of which is an ester. Let me think about possible structures. Ester groups are typically R-O-CO-O-R structures, but wait, no, that's an ester as R-O-CO-R', where R and R' are alkyl or aryl groups. So in an aromatic ring, the substituent could be an ester group like O-CO-O-R, or perhaps an acetyloxy group, but esters usually have the structure like RCOOR'.

Wait, the NMR has signals for -CH3 groups. So perhaps the ester is an ethyl or methyl ester? Let me think. If the ester is, say, methyl, then the carbonyl would be adjacent to a CH3. But wait, methyl esters have a singlet for the CH3, but in our case, there are two CH3 signals. So maybe two different methyl groups attached to the ring or part of the ester.

Wait, but the aromatic ring is di-substituted. So, perhaps one substituent is an ester, and another substituent is another group that has a CH3. Alternatively, maybe the ester is a part of a side chain attached to the ring.

Let me think about the NMR signals. The aromatic Hs: two signals. Let's say the substituents are at the para positions, so the ring has two substituents opposite each other. Then the aromatic Hs would be in two sets of two each. So that's two signals, each integrating to 2 H each, perhaps as a doublet each if they're adjacent to substituents.

The vinyl Hs: one is a doublet, the other a doublet of quartets. Vinyl protons are typically in doublets or more complex splitting. If one is a doublet, maybe it's adjacent to one proton. The doublet of quartets suggests it's coupling with two different sets of protons. Maybe from a CH2 group, but the question says no CH2 signals, so that doesn't fit. Alternatively, perhaps it's next to a CH3 group? Or maybe it's part of a substituent that's adjacent to an oxygen, like an ester.

Wait, the ester group. Let's think about a structure where the aromatic ring has an ester substituent and another group. For example, maybe it's a benzoyl ester or something else. Alternatively, perhaps one substituent is an ester group and the other is a vinyl group.

Wait, but the NMR has two vinyl H signals. So maybe the substituent is a vinyl group, like a CH2-CH2 group, but that would have more signals. Hmm, maybe the substituent is a group like -CH2CH2COOR, but that might have more signals.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a propenyl group or something with two vinyl Hs. Wait, another possibility: the substituent is a carbonyl group, but that doesn't have Hs. So perhaps the substituent is a methoxycarbonyl group or similar.

Wait, let me think about the ester structure. The
