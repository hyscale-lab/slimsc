Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Let me try to unpack it step by step. Hmm. The question is about finding probabilities and the average value of an operator. Alright, let's start.

The state is given as |alpha> proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>. I remember that in quantum mechanics, the state vector's components give the amplitudes for each eigenstate. But wait, since it's proportional, I'll need to normalize it first. So the first thing I should do is find the normalization constant.

Let me write down the state: |alpha> = (1+i)|up> + (2 - i)|down>. Since |up> and |down> are orthonormal, the inner product of |alpha> with itself will be the sum of the magnitudes squared of the coefficients. So the normalization factor N is such that |N|^2 [ |1+i|^2 + |2 - i|^2 ] = 1.

Calculating |1+i|^2: (1)^2 + (1)^2 = 2. Because (1+i)(1-i)=1+1=2. Similarly, |2 - i|^2 is (2)^2 + (-1)^2 =4 +1=5. So the sum is 2 +5=7. Therefore, N^2 =1/7 → N=1/sqrt(7). So the state is (1+i)/sqrt(7)|up> + (2 -i)/sqrt(7)|down>.

Next, I need to find the probabilities of measuring the eigenstates of the operator with matrix Aij. The matrix A has elements A_ij = ħ/2 if i ≠ j, and 0 otherwise. Wait, what does that matrix look like? Let's see, it's a 2x2 matrix. So for a two-level system, the matrix would be:

A = [ [0, ħ/2],
       [ħ/2, 0] ]

Because when i≠j, the elements are ħ/2. So the diagonal elements (i=j) are zero. Hmm, this resembles the Pauli X matrix multiplied by ħ/2. Because the Pauli X matrix is [[0,1],[1,0]], so A is (ħ/2) times that. So the operator is (ħ/2) σ_x.

Now, the eigenstates of σ_x are the eigenstates of A. Because A is a multiple of σ_x. So the eigenstates of A are the same as those of σ_x. Let me recall, the eigenstates of σ_x are (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2) and (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2), right? Let me double-check. Since σ_x |+x> = |+x>, and similarly for the other. So yes, those are the eigenstates.

Wait, actually, I should compute the eigenstates of matrix A. Let me do that. The eigenvalues of A can be found by solving det(A - λ I) =0.

The matrix A has trace 0 (since diagonal elements are zero) and determinant (0)(0) - (ħ/2)^2 = -(ħ²/4). So the eigenvalues are λ = [0 ± sqrt( (0)^2 - 4*( - (ħ/2)^2 ) ) ] / (2*1) ) → sqrt( (ħ²/4) ) → ħ/2 and -ħ/2. So the eigenvalues are ± ħ/2. That makes sense because A is (ħ/2) σ_x and σ_x has eigenvalues ±1.

So the eigenstates are the same as those of σ_x. Let me write them down:

|+x> = (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2)
|-x> = (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2)

Wait, no, the standard eigenstates for σ_x are (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2) for +1 and (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2) for -1. So in terms of A's eigenstates, |+x> corresponds to
