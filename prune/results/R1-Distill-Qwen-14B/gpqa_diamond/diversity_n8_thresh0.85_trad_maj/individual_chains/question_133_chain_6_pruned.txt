Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit stuck, but let's try to break it down step by step. The question is about finding the concentration of orthophosphate ions in a solution. Hmm, orthophosphate is HPO4^3-, right? So I need to figure out how much of that is present in the solution given the amounts of KH2PO4 and Na2HPO4·2H2O.

First, let me read the problem again. The solution has 200.00 cm³, which is 0.2 liters. It contains 1.00 g of KH2PO4 and 1.00 g of Na2HPO4·2H2O. The molecular weights are given: 136.09 g/mol for KH2PO4 and 177.99 g/mol for the sodium hydrogen phosphate dihydrate. The temperature is 25°C, but I'm not sure if that's relevant yet. The Ka values for H3PO4 are given as Ka1=7.5e-3, Ka2=6.2e-8, and Ka3=1.8e-12.

Wait, I remember that H3PO4 is a triprotic acid, so it can donate three protons. The different Ka values correspond to the three dissociation steps. So, the first dissociation is H3PO4 ↔ H+ + H2PO4^- (with Ka1), the second is H2PO4^- ↔ H+ + HPO4^2- (Ka2), and the third is HPO4^2- ↔ H+ + PO4^3- (Ka3).

But the question is about orthophosphate ions, which I think is HPO4^2-? Or wait, sometimes people refer to HPO4^3- as orthophosphate. No, wait, orthophosphate is actually HPO4^3-? No, wait, HPO4^3- is the orthophosphate ion. So when H3PO4 loses two protons, it becomes HPO4^3-.

Wait, no, wait a second. Let me clarify. H3PO4 is phosphoric acid. The first deprotonation gives H2PO4^- (dihydrogen phosphate), the second gives HPO4^2- (hydrogen phosphate), and the third gives PO4^3- (phosphate). So orthophosphate is HPO4^2-.

Hmm, but I'm a bit confused because sometimes people use different terms. But in this context, when they're talking about orthophosphate, it should be the HPO4^2- ion.

So the problem is to find the concentration of HPO4^2- in the solution. 

Now, the solution contains two different salts: KH2PO4 and Na2HPO4·2H2O. Let's think about what each of these salts dissociates into.

KH2PO4 is potassium dihydrogen phosphate. When it dissolves in water, it dissociates into K+ and H2PO4^- ions. So for every mole of KH2PO4, we get one mole of H2PO4^-.

On the other hand, Na2HPO4·2H2O is sodium hydrogen phosphate dihydrate. When it dissolves, it dissociates into 2 Na+ and HPO4^2- ions. So each mole of Na2HPO4·2H2O gives one mole of HPO4^2-.

Wait, but wait. So in the solution, we're adding both H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- ions. But the solution is a buffer solution because it's made of a weak acid and its conjugate base.

Wait, but H2PO4^- can act as an acid (donate a proton to become HPO4^2-) or as a base (accept a proton to become H3PO4). Similarly, HPO4^2- can act as an acid (donate a proton to become PO4^3-) or a base (accept a proton to become H2PO4^-). So the system is a buffer between H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-, which is the second dissociation step.

Wait, but when you mix H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-, the solution will have both species, and the pH will be determined by the pKa2 of H3PO4. Because H2PO4^- can lose a proton to become HPO4^2-, so the relevant equilibrium is H2PO4^- ↔ H+ + HPO4^2-.

So the concentration of HPO4^2- would depend on the concentrations of H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- and the pH of the solution. But wait, in this case, since the solution contains both H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-, the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation might be the way to go here. Or maybe we can calculate the concentration directly because the solution is a mixture of these two salts.

Wait, but let me think again. The problem is asking for the concentration of orthophosphate ions, which is HPO4^2- in this case. So, the solution has both H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-.

Wait, but when you dissolve KH2PO4 and Na2HPO4 in water, both H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- are present. So the solution is a buffer solution of H2PO4^- / HPO4^2-, which relates to the Ka2 value.

But wait, no—the solution is a mixture of the two, so the concentrations of H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- will be determined by the amounts of the two salts. Then, the pH of the solution can be found using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation, and from that, the concentration of HPO4^2- can be calculated.

Alternatively, perhaps I can calculate the total concentration of phosphate species and then find the ratio based on the pH.

Wait, but maybe the solution is simpler. Let's compute the moles of H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- from the given masses.

First, calculate moles of each salt.

Molar mass of KH2PO4 is 136.09 g/mol. So moles = mass / molar mass.

For KH2PO4: 1.00 g / 136.09 g/mol ≈ 0.007345 mol.

Each mole of KH2PO4 gives 1 mole of H2PO4^-.

So moles of H2PO4^- = 0.007345 mol.

For Na2HPO4·2H2O: molar mass is 177.99 g/mol.

Moles = 1.00 g / 177.99 g/mol ≈ 0.005614 mol.

Each mole gives 1 mole of HPO4^2-.

So moles of HPO4^2- = 0.005614 mol.

The total volume is 200 cm³ = 0.2 L.

So concentrations:

[H2PO4^-] = 0.007345 mol / 0.2 L = 0.036725 M.

[HPO4^2-] = 0.005614 mol / 0.2 L = 0.02807 M.

Wait, but wait. These are the concentrations in solution, but the ions can interconvert. However, because the solution is a buffer, the ratio of HPO4^2- to H2PO4^- depends on the pH.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit confused here. The solution is a buffer, so the pH is determined by the ratio of the concentrations of HPO4^2- and H2PO4^-.

The Henderson-Hasselbalch equation for the second dissociation (Ka2) is:

pH = pKa2 + log([HPO4^2-]/[H2PO4^-])

But the problem is that we don't know the pH yet. Alternatively, perhaps the presence of both salts already determines the pH, and the concentrations of HPO4^2- and H2PO4^- are fixed by the amounts of the salts added, but that can't be right because the H2PO4^- can dissoci
