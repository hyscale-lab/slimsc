Okay, so I've got this astronomy question about detecting exoplanets using the transit method. Hmm, I remember that the transit method involves a planet passing in front of its star from our point of view, causing a dip in brightness. The probability of this happening depends on the size of the planet and the star's size, and the alignment of the orbit.

The question says there are two planets, Planet_1 and Planet_2. Both have the same mass, which was detected via the radial velocity (RV) method. But their orbital periods are different; Planet_1's period is three times shorter than Planet_2's. Also, both have circular orbits, which probably simplifies things.

The host stars have the same radii but different masses. Planet_1's star is twice as massive as Planet_2's. Wait, but same radius? So the stars are more massive but same size—maybe they're subgiants or something? Not sure if that matters here.

The researchers want to observe the one with the higher probability of transiting because they have limited time. So the higher the probability, the more likely they'll catch the transit.

I need to figure out which planet has a higher probability of transiting. The transit probability (P) depends on the size of the planet relative to the star and the orbital inclination. But since we're comparing two planets, perhaps relative probabilities can be calculated.

The formula for transit probability is roughly P = (R_p / R_s)^2 * (1/(1 - e²))^(3/2), but since the orbits are circular, e=0. So it simplifies to (R_p / R_s)^2. Wait, but wait. Actually, more accurately, the probability is (R_p / (R_s + R_p))², but since R_p is much smaller than R_s, this approximates to (R_p / R_s)^2.

Wait, no, wait. Another thought: the transit probability also depends on the alignment between the planet's orbital plane and our line of sight. The probability is the ratio of the star's area to the area that the planet would block, which is (R_p / R_s)^2, multiplied by a factor that depends on the orbital inclination. Wait, I might be mixing up some concepts here.

Wait, no, the actual formula for the probability of a transit is (R_p + R_s) / a, where a is the semi-major axis. No, that doesn't make sense. Wait, no, let me think again.

The probability of transit is the chance that the planet's orbital plane is aligned such that
