Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here. Let me read it again. The question says that racemic 3-methylpent-1-ene is treated with Grubbs catalyst. They're asking how many possible products there are, excluding ethene. The options are A)4, B)8, C)6, D)2.

Hmm, I remember Grubbs catalyst is used for olefin metathesis reactions. Metathesis involves the redistribution of alkene fragments. Grubbs is a transition metal catalyst, usually rhodium or ruthenium-based, used for ring-closing metathesis and other olefin metathesis reactions. So when Grubbs is used, the double bonds can break and reform, leading to different products.

The starting material is 3-methylpent-1-ene. Let me draw that structure. Pent-1-ene means the double bond starts at carbon 1. So the structure is CH2=CH-C(H)(CH2CH3)-? Wait, wait. Wait, pent-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH2CH3. But wait, 3-methylpent-1-ene. So the structure would be CH2=CH-C(CH2CH3)-CH2CH3? No, wait, the pent chain is five carbons. Let me think. The formula for pent-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH2CH3. But when it's 3-methyl, the structure would be CH2=CH-C(CH3)-CH2CH3? No, wait, the position of the substituents is important.

Wait, 3-methylpent-1-ene is CH2=CHCH(CH2CH3)CH2? Wait, no because pent means five carbons. So pent-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH2CH3. 3-methyl would add a methyl group on carbon 3. But carbon 1 is the double bond, so carbon 3 is the third carbon. Let me number: 1 is the double bond, so the structure is:

Carbon 1: CH2=
Carbon 2: CH-
Carbon 3: CH(CH3)
Wait, wait, the structure is CH2=CH-CH(CH2CH3)-? Wait, no, because pent has five carbons. Maybe it's better to think of it as:

The molecule is CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2CH3. Wait, but that would be five carbons? Let's count: CH2=CH is two, then CH(CH3), then CH2CH3. That's
