Okay, so I've got this question about the Lagrangian and whether the theory is renormalizable. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my QFT, but let me think through this step by step.

The Lagrangian given is L_int = κ ψ̄ σ_{μν} ψ F^{μν}. Oh wait, σ_{μν} is (i/2)[γ_μ, γ_ν]. Right, those are the antisymmetric products of gamma matrices. F^{μν} is the field strength tensor, which I remember is like ∂^μ A^ν - ∂^ν A^μ, or something like that. But wait, in this case, what's the field? I think A here is a vector potential, like in electromagnetism, so the field is for a gauge field.

But wait, the question is about the mass dimension of κ and whether the theory is renormalizable. So I need to find the mass dimension of each term in the Lagrangian and figure out the dimension of κ.

Let me recall: in 4-dimensional spacetime, the mass dimension is related to the scaling of fields. The Lagrangian density has dimension [Mass]^4 because the action is dimensionless, and the integral is over four dimensions.

So each term in the Lagrangian must have mass dimension 4.

Now, let's break down the term κ ψ̄ σ_{μν} ψ F^{μν}.

First, I need to find the dimensions of ψ, σ_{μν}, and F^{μν}.

The Dirac spinor ψ has mass dimension 3/2 because, in the kinetic term i ψ̄ γ^μ ∂_μ ψ, each derivative has dimension 1. So (i ψ̄ γ ∂ ψ) must have dimension 4. Let's see: ψ has [3/2], so ψ̄ is same? So ψ̄ γ ∂μ ψ: [3/2] + [1] + [3/2] = 3/2 + 1 +3/2 = 4. Yep, that works.

So ψ has [3/2].

Now σ_{μν} is (i/2)[γ_μ, γ_ν]. The gamma matrices are dimensionless (they're just matrices), and each γ has [0], so the commutator [γ_mu, gamma_nu] has dimension 0. So sigma_{mu nu} has dimension 0.

What about F^{mu nu}? For a gauge field A, the field strength F is ∂μ Aν - ∂ν Aμ. So each ∂ has dimension 1, and A has dimension 1 (since the gauge field term in the Lagrangian is something like (1/4) F^2, which needs to have dimension 4. Let me check: F is ∂A, which is dimension 1+1=2. Then F^2 would be 4, so (1/4) F^2 has dimension 4, correct. So A has dimension 1. So F has dimension 2.

So putting all together: the term is κ * ψ̄ * σ_{μν} * ψ * F^{μν}.

Let me compute the dimensions of each part:

- ψ̄ has [3/2], same as ψ.
- σ_{μν} is dimension 0.
- F^{μν} is dimension 2.
- So the product ψ̄ σ ψ F is [3/2] * 0 * [3/2] * 2 = (3/2 + 3/2 + 2) ? Wait no, dimensions multiply. Actually, each factor's dimension is multiplied. So:

Wait, no, wait. Each field's dimension is multiplied. So:

ψ̄: 3/2

σ_{μν}: 0

ψ: 3/2

F: 2

So the product is (3/2) * (0) * (3/2) * 2. Wait, but that can't be right because multiplying by zero would make the whole term zero. That can't be. Oh wait, no, the sigma term is a tensor made of gamma matrices, which are just matrices and have no mass dimension. So the dimension of σ_{μν} is indeed 0, but it's a tensor, so when multiplied by F^{μν}, which has dimension 2, it's part of the tensor structure, but dimensionally, it's just 0.

Wait, perhaps I should approach this differently. Let me think about each term's dimensions:

The whole term must have dimension 4 because it's part of the Lagrangian. So κ * [ψ̄ σ ψ] * [F] must have dimension 4.

Wait, but ψ̄ σ ψ is a scalar, right? Because σ_{μν} is a tensor, but when you contract it with ψ̄ and ψ, you get a scalar. So what's the dimension of ψ̄ σ ψ? 

Since σ is dimensionless (0), and each ψ is 3/2. So ψ̄ (3/2) * σ (0) * ψ (3/2) = 3/2 + 3/2 = 3. So ψ̄ σ ψ has dimension 3.

Then, F^{mu nu} has dimension 2. So the product (ψ̄ σ ψ) * F has dimension 3 + 2 =5.

Then, the entire term is κ multiplied by that product. So the term is κ * (dimension 5). Since the term must have dimension 4, we have:

kappa * 5 =4 → so [κ] must be 4 -5 = -1.

So the mass dimension of κ is -1.

Now, the second part: is the theory renormalizable?

Renormalizability depends on the mass dimension of the coupling constant. For a theory to be renormalizable, the coupling constants must have positive mass dimension (or zero for marginal operators).

Wait, no, wait. Let me think. Each interaction term in the Lagrangian must have a dimension ≤4. Because higher dimensional terms would make the theory non-renormalizable, as they introduce high-energy behavior.

Wait, but in this case, the term is part of the Lagrangian, which must have dimension 4. So if the coupling's dimension is negative, does that make the theory renormalizable? Or not?

Wait, in general, for a term in the Lagrangian like g φ^n, the dimension is [g] + n [φ] =4. So [g] =4 -n [φ].

If [g] is positive, the term is renormalizable. If [g] is negative, it's non-renormalizable because you can't have a positive mass dimension coupling without a counterterm at higher order.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused. Let me get it straight.

Renormalizable theories require that the coupling constants have mass dimension ≥0. Because higher dimension terms (nonrenormalizable) have negative mass dimension for their couplings.

Wait, no. The idea is that renormalizable theories have interactions with coupling constants of dimension ≤4 (since the term is in the Lagrangian which has dimension 4). So for a term like g O, where O is an operator of dimension d, then [g] =4 -d. If [g] ≤4, but that's not the point. The key is that for the theory to be renormalizable, the coupling constants should have positive or zero mass dimension. Because if [g] is negative, the interaction becomes stronger at higher energies, making the theory non-renormalizable.

So in our case, [κ] is -1, which is negative. So the interaction is non-renormalizable. Because each time you have a loop, you need to introduce more counterterms, which leads to an infinite number of terms, making the theory not predictive.

Therefore, the theory is not renormalizable.

So putting it together: [κ] is -1, and the theory is not renormalizable.

Looking at the options, option C says [κ]_M = -1 and the theory is not renormalizable. So the answer should be C.


To determine the mass dimension of the coupling constant $\kappa$ and whether the theory is renormalizable, we analyze the given Lagrangian:

\[
\mathcal{L}_{\text{int}} = \kappa \bar{\psi} \sigma_{\mu\nu} \psi F^{\mu\nu},
\]
where $\sigma_{\mu\nu} = \frac{i}{2}[\gamma_\mu, \gamma_\nu]$ and $F^{\mu\nu}$ is the field strength tensor.

### Step 1: Mass dimensions of the fields
- The Dirac spinor $\psi$ has mass dimension $[\psi]_M = \frac{3}{2}$, as it appears in the kinetic term $\bar{\psi} \gamma^\mu \partial_\mu \psi$, which must have dimension 4 in 4 spacetime dimensions.
- The field strength tensor $F^{\mu\nu}$ has mass dimension $[F]_M = 2$, as it is derived from the gauge field $A_\mu$ with $[A_\mu]_M = 1$.
- The $\sigma_{\mu\nu}$ tensor, defined as $\sigma_{\mu\nu} = \frac{i}{2}[\gamma_\mu, \gamma_\nu]$, is a combination of gamma matrices, which are dimensionless. Thus, $[\sigma_{\mu\nu}]_M = 0$.

### Step 2: Mass dimension of $\kappa$
The Lagrangian density $\mathcal{L}_{\text{int}}$ must have mass dimension 4. Breaking down the term $\kappa \bar{\psi} \sigma_{\mu\nu} \psi F^{\mu\nu}$:
- $[\bar{\psi}]_M = [\psi]_M = \frac{3}{2}$.
- $[\sigma_{\mu\nu}]_M = 0$.
- $[F^{\mu\nu}]_M = 2$.

The product $\bar{\psi} \sigma_{\mu\nu} \psi F^{\mu\nu}$ has mass dimension:
\[
[\bar{\psi}]_M + [\sigma_{\mu\nu}]_M + [\psi]_M + [F^{\mu\nu}]_M = \frac{3}{2} + 0 + \frac{3}{2} + 2 = 4.
\]

Since the entire term must have mass dimension 4, the coupling constant $\kappa$ must satisfy:
\[
[\kappa]_M + 4 = 4 \implies [\kappa]_M = 0 - 4 = -1.
\]

### Step 3: Renormalizability of the theory
A theory is renormalizable if all coupling constants have non-negative mass dimension. In this case, $[\kappa]_M = -1$, which is negative. This indicates that the interaction term is non-renormalizable because the coupling constant becomes stronger at higher energies, requiring an infinite number of counterterms to define the theory.

### Final Answer
The mass dimension of $\kappa$ is $[\kappa]_M = -1$, and the theory is not renormalizable.
