Okay, so I've got this NMR problem to solve. Let me start by reading through it carefully. The question is about identifying Compound X based on the NMR data of the product after a reaction. The reaction conditions are with 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane in a nonpolar solvent at 403 K for a day. Hmm, wait, what's that reaction? Oh right, 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane is a common base used in the epoxidation of alkenes. So the reaction probably involves an alkene reacting to form an epoxide. Therefore, the product is an epoxide.

The starting material, Compound X, is C11H12O. Let me think about the formula. If it's an epoxide, the product would likely be an oxide with structure similar to an alkene oxide. So, in the product, the epoxide would have two oxygen atoms, but wait, the molecular formula of the product isn't given. Oh, wait, the product's NMR is shown, but the molecular formula isn't given. Maybe the formula of the product is same as X but with the epoxide formed. Wait, no, X is C11H12O. Epoxide would add an oxygen, so the product would be C11H10O2? Or maybe I'm getting that wrong. Let me think: an epoxide formation typically replaces a double bond (which is O) with an oxygen in the epoxide. Wait, no. For example, ethylene (C2H4) reacting with an oxidizing agent to form ethylene oxide (C2H4O). So the product gains an oxygen atom. So if X is C11H12O, the product would be C11H10O2? Because ethylene (C2H4) becomes ethylene oxide (C2H4O). So X must have a double bond which gets converted into an epoxide, adding one O. So X has a formula with one double bond, maybe?

Wait, but the product's molecular formula isn't given. The question is about the starting material, X. So perhaps the product is an epoxide, and the NMR reflects that.

So, the product of the reaction is an epoxide. Let me look at the NMR data.

The 1H NMR has the following signals:

δ 2.28 (3H, s)
δ 2.31 (3H, s)
δ 6.75 (1H, d)
δ 7.08 (2H, d)
δ 7.68 (1H, d)
δ 7.71 (2H, d)

So, two singlets each for 3H, maybe two methyl groups. Then a doublet at 6.75, and two doublets in the aromatic region: 7.08 (2H, d), 7.68 (1H, d), 7.71 (2H, d). Wait, wait, the integration adds up to 1+2+1+2=6. But wait, the aromatic region should have 6 protons in a benzene ring. So perhaps this is a substituted benzene with some substituents.

Looking at the 13C NMR data:

21.3 (1C, s) – maybe a methyl attached to something electronegative, like an oxygen.
28.4 (1C, s) – another methyl, perhaps more like a CH3 attached to a carbon in the ring?
126.9 (2C, s) – sp2 carbons, maybe part of a double bond or aromatic carbons.
127.1 (1C, s) – another sp2 carbon.
129.1 (2C, s) – more sp2.
130.3 (1C, s) – perhaps another sp2.
141.5 (1C, s) – maybe a carbonyl carbon or an oxygen-bearing carbon, like an epoxide.
144.1 (1C, s) – another quaternary carbon.
197.7 (1C, s) – that's a carbonyl, maybe a ketone or an epoxide. Wait, epoxides don’t typically have such a high shift for the carbons. Wait, epoxide carbons are usually around 50-60 ppm. But wait, 197.7 is really high, so maybe it's a carbonyl group. Hmm. So perhaps the product isn't an epoxide but something else? Wait, but the reaction conditions suggest epoxidation. Or maybe I'm wrong.

Wait, let me think again. Epoxide carbons (the oxygen connected to two carbons) in 13C NMR usually appear around 50-60 ppm. So 197.7 is way higher. Hmm. That makes me think that maybe the product isn't an epoxide. Wait, but the reaction is with a base which is used in ep
