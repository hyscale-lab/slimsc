Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of buffer solutions and phosphate equilibria. But let's see what I can do.

The problem says we have a solution with 200 cm³ (which is 0.2 liters) containing 1.00 g of KH2PO4 and 1.00 g of Na2HPO4·2H2O. The molar masses are given: 136.09 g/mol for KH2PO4 and 177.99 g/mol for the sodium hydrogen phosphate dihydrate. The question is asking for the concentration of orthophosphate ions, PO4^3-.

Hmm, orthophosphate is H3PO4, but in the solution, we have different forms because of the dissociation. The phosphate ions can be in various forms depending on the pH. So I think the key here is to recognize that we have a buffer solution. Because KH2PO4 is H2PO4^- (since K+ is a spectator ion), and Na2HPO4 is HPO4^2-.

Wait, so the two components are H2PO4^- (from KH2PO4) and HPO4^2- (from Na2HPO4). That's correct. So this should form a buffer system between H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-, right? Because they can interconvert by the loss or gain of a proton.

The next thing I remember is that the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation can be used for buffer solutions. The equation is pH = pKa + log([base]/[acid]). But wait, which pKa do we use here? Because phosphate has three dissociation steps.

Phosphoric acid (H3PO4) has three dissociations:
1. H3PO4 ↔ H+ + H2PO4^- (Ka1 = 7.5e-3)
2. H2PO4^- ↔ H+ + HPO4^2- (Ka2 = 6.2e-8)
3. HPO4^2- ↔ H+ + PO4^3- (Ka3 = 1.8e-12)

But in our case, the relevant equilibrium is between H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-. So the second dissociation (Ka2) is the one we should use. Therefore, the pKa we need is pKa2, which is log(6.2e-8). Let me calculate that.

pKa2 = log(6.2e-8) → log(6.2) is about 0.79, so 0.79 -8 = -7.21? Wait, no, wait. Wait, no. Because 6.2e-8 is 6.2 multiplied by 10^-8. So the log is log(6.2) + log(1e-8) → 0.79 + (-8) → so pKa2 is 7.21? Wait, no, wait. Wait, no, pKa is -log(Ka), right. So Ka2 is 6.2e-8. So pKa2 is -log(6.2e-8) → log(6.2) is about 0.79, so 0.79 + 8 = 8.79? No, that can't be right because 1e-8 would have a pKa of 8, and 6.2e-8 is larger than 1e-8, so the pKa should be less than 8. Wait, wait: pKa = -log(6.2e-8). So let me compute this correctly.

Ka2 is 6.2e-8. So pKa2 = -log(6.2e-8) → let me compute the log. Let's see, log(6.2) is approximately 0.7924, so log(6.2e-8) is 0.7924 -8 = -7.2076. But since pKa is the negative
