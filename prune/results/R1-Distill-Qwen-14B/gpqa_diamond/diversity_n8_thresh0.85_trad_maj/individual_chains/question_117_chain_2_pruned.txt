Okay, so I've got this question about organic chemistry, specifically about optical isomerism. Hmm, optical isomerism is when compounds have the ability to rotate plane-polarized light, right? That usually happens when there's a chiral center in the molecule. A chiral center is a carbon atom bonded to four different groups. So I need to check each compound to see if they have such a center.

The question gives four organic moieties, and I have to pick which ones exhibit optical isomerism. Let's go through each one by one.

1. Dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate. Hmm, this looks a bit complex. So it's a biphenyl compound with substituents. The structure is two phenyl groups connected by a single bond, right? The substituents are nitro groups at 6 and 6', and carboxylate groups at 2 and 2'. So each phenyl ring has a nitro and a carboxylate group.

Wait, biphenyls can sometimes have axial chirality. Axial chirality occurs when the two phenyl rings are connected in such a way that the arrangement around the single bond is chiral. For axial chirality, the substituents on each phenyl must be in such positions that rotating the bond would result in a non-superimposable mirror image.

Looking at the substituents here: each phenyl has a nitro and a carboxylate. Let me see. The positions are 6 and 2 on the biphenyl. So if the substituents are in positions that create non-superimposable mirror images when the bond between the phenyls is rotated, then there might be axial chirality. Wait, but are the substituents arranged in such a way that this is possible?

Wait, in a biphenyl system, for axial chirality, the substituents on each ring need to be in positions that are not symmetrical. For example, in 1,2-disubstituted biphenyls, if the substituents are in such positions that they are not mirror images, the molecule can have axial chirality. But in this case, the substituents are at 2 and 6 on each phenyl. Wait, each phenyl has a nitro at 6 and a carboxylate at 2. So the arrangement is nitro at position 6 on each, and carboxylate at 2 on each. But wait, the positions are mirrored on each ring.

Wait, perhaps I should imagine the structure. Each ring is connected in a way that the substituents are on opposite sides. Let me think: if one ring has a nitro at 6 and a carboxylate at 2, the other ring has the same. So when you look at the biphenyl, each ring has a nitro and a COOCH3 group. Are these groups arranged in a way that makes the molecule chiral?

Alternatively, maybe each substituent is on the same side or opposite sides. If they are on the same side, then the molecule might not be chiral. Hmm, but I'm not entirely sure. Another possibility is that the central single bond allows for the two substituents on each ring to create a chiral axis. So perhaps if the substituents are in the right positions, this could lead to axial chirality. Alternatively, maybe each substituent is a mirror image, so no axial chirality.

Wait, maybe I should think about the substituents at 2 and 6. In the biphenyl, positions 2 and 6 are adjacent to the central bond. So if on each ring, substituents are at 2 and 6, perhaps the arrangement around the central bond could lead to a chiral axis. But I'm not certain. Maybe I should come back to this after looking at the others.

2. Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate. Let's draw this structure. Propanoate means a propionate ester. So the structure is CH2CH(OH)COOCH3. Wait, no. Wait, the formula is methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate, which is CH3CH(OH)COOCH3? Wait, wait, no. Wait, propanoate is CH2COO-. So the 2-hydroxypropanoate would be HO-CH2-COOCH3? No, wait, the structure is (CH3)CH(OH)COOCH3? Hmm, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think again.

Propanoate is CH2CH2COO- but with the hydroxyl on the second carbon. So the structure is CH3-CHOH-COOCH3. So that's a chiral center at the second carbon. Because it's connected to: a methyl group (CH3), a hydroxyl (OH), a carbonyl group (COOCH3), and perhaps a hydrogen (if the structure is CH3-C(OH)H-COOCH3). Wait, yes. So the
