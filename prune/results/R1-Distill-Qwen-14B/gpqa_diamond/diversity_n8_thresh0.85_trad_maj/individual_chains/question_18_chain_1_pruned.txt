Okay, so I've got this problem about stars and their elemental abundances. Hmm, let me read through it again to make sure I get all the details right.

So, there are two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. Their masses are 1.5 and 1.2 times the Sun's mass, respectively. The problem gives me some abundance ratios using the EW method. The elements involved are Si, Fe, Mg, and H. 

The given values are:
- [Si/Fe]_1 is 0.3 dex.
- [Mg/Si]_2 is 0.3 dex.
- [Fe/H]_1 is 0 dex.
- [Mg/H]_2 is 0 dex.

The Sun's photospheric composition is provided:
- 12 + log10(nFe/nH) = 7.5 → So log(nFe/nH) = 7.5 -12 = -4.5 → nFe/nH = 10^-4.5 ≈ 3.16e-5.
- 12 + log10(nMg/nH) = 7 → log(nMg/nH) = 7-12 = -5 → nMg/nH = 1e-5.

We're supposed to find the ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2. That is, what's [Si/Star_2] / [Si/Star_1], or maybe it's the ratio [Star_1 Si]/[Star_2 Si]?

Wait, no. The question says the ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2. So, it's (n_Si,1 / n_Si,2).

But wait, wait. Let me think. The problem says, "the ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2." So yes, that's Star_1's Si divided by Star_2's Si. So, [Si/Star2] of Star1 divided by [Si/Star2] of Star2? Or wait, no, because the ratio in each star is relative to H.

Wait, no. Let's think about what these abundance ratios mean. The notation [X/Y] means log10(n_X / n_Y) relative to the Sun. So [X/Y]_star = log10(n_X/n_Y in star) - log10(n_X/n_Y in Sun
