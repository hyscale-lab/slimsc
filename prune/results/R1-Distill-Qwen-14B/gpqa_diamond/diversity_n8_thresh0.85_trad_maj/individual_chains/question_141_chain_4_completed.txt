Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. Let me try to figure it out step by step. The question is about treating 1-bromobenzene-2-d with NaNH2 in condensed ammonia solvent. Hmm, I need to find out how many possible organic products are formed.

Wait, wait, 1-bromobenzene-2-d... Oh right, that's a benzene ring with a bromine at position 1 and a deuterium (d) at position 2. So the structure is bromine at carbon 1 and deuterium at carbon 2. But wait, benzene is a ring, so positions are numbered. Let me visualize it. Carbon 1 is brominated, and the adjacent carbon (carbon 2) has a deuterium.

Now, what's the reaction here? It's NaNH2 in condensed ammonia. I remember that NaNH2 is a strong base, often used in dehydrohalogenation or elimination reactions. Also, in aromatic substitution, it might cause some kind of elimination, maybe forming a benzene ring with a double bond or something else.

Wait, but wait. Benzene is already aromatic, so maybe it's a substitution reaction. Oh, but wait, bromobenzene is typically not very reactive towards nucleophilic substitution because the ring is electron-rich and the leaving group is ortho/para directing. But in this case, the solvent is condensed ammonia, which is a polar aprotic solvent. Hmm, but that's more for SN2 reactions, but aromatic SN2 is not common because of the ring's structure.

Alternatively, maybe this reaction is about elimination, like forming a benzene with a double bond. Wait, but benzene is already a ring of conjugated double bonds. So that can't be it.

Oh, wait, maybe it's about a benzidine-type reaction or some kind of coupling. Or perhaps it's about elimination leading to some kind of ring expansion or contraction? Not sure.

Wait, another thought: NaNH2 is a strong base and can deprotonate things. But in this case, the ring might not have any acidic protons. Wait, but deuterium is at position 2. Oh wait, wait a second. If the ring has a deuterium at position 2, which is adjacent to the bromine at position 1, perhaps that's a possibility for some kind of elimination.

Wait, another idea: Maybe this is a case of elimination, forming a triple bond. Because when you have a benzene ring with a leaving group and a hydrogen (or deuterium) adjacent, under strong base conditions, you can eliminate to form an alkyne. Like the formation of benzyne or something similar.

Wait, benzyne is a diradical intermediate, but that usually involves two leaving groups. But in this case, we have one bromine and one deuterium. So perhaps the base abstracts the deuterium, and then the bromide leaves, forming a triple bond. Wait, but wait, benzene is a ring of six carbons. If the bromine is at C1 and deuterium at C2, removing H (or D) from C2 and Br from C1 would leave a triple bond between C1 and C2, converting the two adjacent carbons into a C≡C.

Wait, but would that form a triple bond in the ring? So benzene would become a benzene with a triple bond between C1 and C2, making it a benzyne (aryne) intermediate? Or wait, actually, in benzyne formation, you typically have two substituents that can leave, like two bromines, so when they leave, you get a triple bond.

But in this case, we have only one bromine. Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused here.

Alternatively, perhaps the deuterium isn't directly involved. Wait, but wait, the solvent is ammonia. Maybe it's a substitution reaction where the bromide is replaced by an amide group or something. But NaNH2 is a source of NH2-.

Wait, but wait a second. If it's a substitution, the bromide would leave, and the amide would come in. But the ring is activated for substitution? No, bromobenzene is not very reactive towards nucleophilic aromatic substitution because the ring is electron-rich, making the leaving group (bromide) a poor leaving group in that scenario. Electrophilic substitution is more common, but that's when you have a good leaving group or an activating group.

Wait, but wait, NaNH2 is a strong base. Maybe it's abstracting a proton alpha to the bromine. But in this case, the positions are adjacent. Let me think: The ring has Br at C1, and D at C2. Under strong base, could the base abstract a hydrogen (but in this case it's a deuterium) from C2, making a carbanion adjacent to Br? Then, the Br could leave, leading to some kind of elimination.

Wait, since the C2 has D, which is less acidic than H? Or more? Deuterium is slightly more acidic than H because of the isotope effect. Wait, no. Wait, actually, for H and D, D is less acidic than H because the bond strength is higher. So the pKa of D is about 1-2 units higher than H. So in this case, the H (deuterium) at C2 is less acidic than regular H. So maybe the base (NH2-) isn't strong enough to abstract it? Hmm, but wait, NaNH2 is a strong base. So perhaps it can abstract the D.

Wait, but if the base abstracts the D from C2, then the C2 becomes negatively charged. Then, the Br at C1 is a good leaving group, right? So perhaps that leads to the formation of a benzene ring with a triple bond between C1 and C2. So the product would be a benzene ring with a triple bond between those two carbons, making a triple bond in the ring. But wait, benzene rings can't have triple bonds because that would disrupt the aromaticity. Wait, no, that's not right. Wait, benzyne is a known compound. It's a highly strained alkyne in a benzene ring. So when two substituents are eliminated, you get a triple bond, forming benzyne, which is a diradical or a triple bond in the ring.

But in this case, we have only one Br and a D, so maybe elimination leads to a triple bond. So the product would be a benzene ring with a triple bond between C1 and C2. But wait, would that be the only product? Or could there be some isomerism?

Wait, but in the case of benzyne, the triple bond can be in different positions, but in our case, since the Br and D are adjacent, elimination would only result in one possible triple bond position, right? So why would multiple products form?

Wait, another possibility: Maybe the reaction doesn't stop at the triple bond. Maybe further reactions could occur. Or perhaps the triple bond could rearrange.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction leads to the formation of a benzene ring with a substituent. Wait, but I'm not sure.

Wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me try to think again. The starting material is 1-bromo-2-deutero benzene. The reaction is with NaNH2 in ammonia. So what's the mechanism here?

Another approach: NaNH2 is a strong base. It can deprotonate things, but in this molecule, the only protons (deuterium in this case) are adjacent to the Br. So perhaps the base abstracts that deuterium, making a carbanion at C2. Then the Br at C1 leaves as Br-.

So the ring would have a negative charge at C2 and a positive charge at C1? Wait, no, because if the D is abstracted, C2 becomes negatively charged, and the Br leaves, so C1 would have a positive charge. Wait, but in a benzene ring, such charges would delocalize.

Wait, perhaps this leads to the formation of a benzene ring with a triple bond, as previously thought. So that would be a single product. But wait, the question is about possible organic products. So in this case, would that be the only product?

Wait, but I'm not entirely sure. Let me think about the possible outcomes. When you have a benzene ring with Br at C1 and a D at C2, and you deprotonate C2 and eliminate Br, you get a triple bond between C1 and C2. So that would create a triple bond in the ring, which would be a benzyne. So the product is 1,2-didehydrobenzene, which is a triple bond between C1 and C2.

But wait, in benzyne, there are two possible structures because the triple bond can be in two different orientations (ortho positions). But in this case, since the starting material has Br at C1 and D at C2, elimination can only create a triple bond between those two positions, so only one product. So that would result in one product.

Wait, but isn't benzyne a diradical or a triple bond that can be in different positions? Or does the position depend on the starting material?

Wait, no. Wait, when you have a bromobenzene with Br in the para position to another substituent, you can get different products. But in our case, the substituents are adjacent, so the elimination can only occur between C1 and C2, leading to a single product.

Alternatively, wait a second, another possibility: Maybe the reaction doesn't eliminate but instead substitutes. So Br is replaced by NH2. But wait, bromobenzene is not very reactive towards nucleophilic substitution because the ring is electron-rich, making the C-Br bond stable. NaNH2 is a strong base but not a strong nucleophile under these conditions. Or maybe it is?

Wait, but if the substitution occurs, the product would be aniline derivative with the NH2 group at position 1 (where Br was). But wait, in this case, the ring has a deutero group at position 2. So would that affect the substitution? Also, the solvent is ammonia, which would have NH3 as the solvent.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a substitution where the bromide is replaced by an amide group. So the product would be 1-amino-2-deutero benzene. But again, I'm not sure about the feasibility of that substitution.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is more about elimination, as I thought before, leading to the triple bond.

Wait, another thought: The reaction conditions (NaNH2 in ammonia) are often used for dehydrohalogenation, especially in aliphatic systems. So maybe the same applies here. So elimination would form a triple bond.

But wait, in aromatic systems, elimination to form a triple bond is possible, as in the case of benzyne. So if the reaction forms benzyne, then the product would be a triple bond between C1 and C2.

But wouldn't that be a single product? So only one product forms.

Wait, but let me think about any possible isomerism. If the triple bond can be in different positions, but in this case, it can't because the starting material has Br and D in specific positions.

Wait, but wait. Another possibility: Maybe the ring can undergo some kind of rearrangement after elimination. For example, the triple bond could shift positions through some mechanism, leading to different products.

But in benzene, the positions are equivalent because of the ring's symmetry. Wait, but in this case, the starting material isn't symmetric because the Br is at C1 and D at C2, so the positions are fixed. So elimination would only form the triple bond between C1 and C2.

Wait, but wait, benzene is symmetric, so maybe after elimination, the triple bond could rotate, but in reality, the triple bond is fixed between C1 and C2, so that would still be a single product.

Hmm. So if the reaction leads to elimination, forming a triple bond between C1 and C2, then one product forms. Are there any other possible products?

Wait, another possibility: Maybe the base abstracts a proton from another position on the ring, leading to a different elimination. But the ring is already substituted with Br and D adjacent, so perhaps neighboring positions are less likely to lose a proton because of steric or electronic factors.

Wait, but wait, the ring is benzene, so all positions are equivalent in terms of structure, except for the substituents. So in this case, the substituents are at C1 and C2. So if the base abstracts a proton (deuterium) from C2, leading to elimination of Br from C1, that's the only possibility. So that would form one product.

Alternatively, maybe there's another possibility where the elimination forms a different structure, but I can't think of any.

Wait, but wait, what about the possibility of substitution instead of elimination? Could the bromide be replaced by something else? Let's say, if substitution occurs, then the product would have NH2- at C1. But the solvent is ammonia, so perhaps that's possible.

Wait, but I'm not sure about the feasibility of this substitution. Normally, nucleophilic aromatic substitution requires the ring to be electron-deficient, which isn't the case here because Br is an electron-withdrawing group. But wait, Br is ortho/para directing, so maybe it's activating for electrophilic substitution, but not nucleophilic.

Wait, no, nucleophilic aromatic substitution typically occurs when the ring is electron-deficient, activating the ring towards nucleophilic attack. So if the ring has strong electron-withdrawing groups, like nitro groups, then nucleophilic substitution is possible.

In this case, the ring has a Br, which is an electron-withdrawing group (due to its electronegativity), but not as strong as nitro. So perhaps under strong basic conditions, substitution could occur.

If substitution happens, the Br would be replaced by NH2. But wait, the position is C1, and the D is at C2. So the product would be 1-amino-2-deutero benzene. But would that be the only product, or are there other possibilities?

Wait, but substitution would be a single product because the starting material is specific. So that would be another product. So now I'm thinking, could there be two products: one from substitution and one from elimination.

Hmm, that would complicate things. So how to decide which reaction occurs?

Let me think about the reaction conditions. NaNH2 is a strong base, but it's also a good nucleophile. But in this case, the solvent is ammonia, which is aprotic. So perhaps the reaction favors elimination over substitution because the base is strong.

Wait, but for elimination, the base needs to abstract a proton (or deuterium) adjacent to the leaving group. In this case, the D is adjacent to Br, so that's favorable. So elimination would be more likely than substitution.

Wait, but substitution would require the nucleophile (NH2-) to attack the ring, but for aromatic substitution, the ring needs to be activated towards nucleophilic attack. Since Br is a weak electron-withdrawing group, maybe the ring isn't activated enough for nucleophilic substitution.

So perhaps the reaction proceeds via elimination, leading to a single product (the triple bond in the ring).

So with that, the answer would be one product, so option B.

Wait, but wait. Let me think again. If the reaction produces a triple bond, would that be the only product? Or could there be multiple regioisomers or other products?

In this case, since the starting material has Br and D in fixed positions, elimination can only form a triple bond between those two positions, so only one product.

So the number of possible organic products is 1. So the answer is option B.


The reaction involves treating 1-bromobenzene-2-d with NaNH₂ in condensed ammonia solvent. The starting material is a benzene ring with a bromine atom at position 1 and a deuterium atom at position 2. NaNH₂ is a strong base, and the reaction conditions suggest that elimination is more likely than substitution.

In this case, the base (NH₂⁻) can abstract the deuterium at position 2, creating a negatively charged carbon. The bromine at position 1 then leaves as Br⁻, resulting in the formation of a triple bond between positions 1 and 2. This product is a benzene ring with a triple bond between C1 and C2, equivalent to 1,2-didehydrobenzene (benzyne).

The reaction leads to a single product because the starting material has fixed substituents (Br at C1 and D at C2), and elimination can only occur between these two positions. Substitution is unlikely because nucleophilic aromatic substitution requires the ring to be electron-deficient, which is not the case here due to the weak electron-withdrawing nature of bromine. Additionally, the reaction conditions favor elimination over substitution.

Thus, only one organic product is formed in this reaction.

Answer: B
