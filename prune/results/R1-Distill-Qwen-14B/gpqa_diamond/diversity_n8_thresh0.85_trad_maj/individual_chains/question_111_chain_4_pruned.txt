Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem to solve. It's about two reactions, and I need to choose the major products from the options given. Hmm, let's break it down step by step.

The first reaction is between 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one and ethyl acrylate, using t-BuOK as the base. The product is labeled A. The second reaction is 1-nitropropane reacting with KOH, (E)-but-2-enenitrile, and water to form product B.

Alright, starting with reaction A. The starting material is a cyclohexanone derivative with substituents. The structure is 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one. So, the ketone is at position 1, which is the same as the cyclohexyl group. Wait, no, the numbering might be a bit tricky. Let me visualize the structure. Cyclohexanone has a ketone at position 1. Then, at position 2, there's an ethyl group, and at position 6, a methyl group. Also, another methyl group at position 2 (because it's 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethyl). So, position 2 has both ethyl and methyl substituents, and position 6 has methyl.

The reagent is ethyl acrylate and t-BuOK. I remember that when a ketone reacts with an enolate, it can undergo an aldol addition. But wait, ethyl acrylate is an ester and can act as a Michael acceptor, right? Or maybe it's the other way around. Alternatively, since t-BuOK is a strong, bulky base, it might promote an enolate formation, leading to a conjugate addition.

Wait, another possibility is that the cyclohexanone is undergoing a Claisen or Aldol condensation with ethyl acrylate. But wait, in the presence of a base, the cyclohexanone would form an enolate. The enolate can attack the electrophilic part of ethyl acrylate. Since ethyl acrylate is an alpha,beta-unsaturated ester, the enolate would likely perform a Michael addition.

So the reaction is a Michael addition. The enolate will attack the alpha,beta-unsaturated ester. The question is where the addition occurs on the cyclohexanone ring.

The cyclohexanone is 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexanone. When forming the enolate, the base abstracts an alpha proton, which is adjacent to the ketone. The possible alpha positions are the carbons next to the carbonyl. The carbonyl is at position 1, so alpha carbons are positions 2 and 6. Wait, but in a cyclohexanone, the carbonyl is at position 1, so the adjacent positions (2 and 6) are the alpha positions. 

But the substituents at position 2 are a bit bulky: ethyl and methyl groups. So, steric hindrance might influence which position the base abstracts a proton from. The base is t-BuOK, which is bulky, so it's more likely to abstract the more accessible proton. Let's see: position 2 has ethyl and methyl groups, which makes it crowded. Position 6 is a methyl group, which is less bulky. So the base may prefer to abstract the proton at position 6, forming the enolate at position 6.

Wait, no, wait. The carbonyl is at position 1, so the alpha carbons are adjacent to that. Let me think about the numbering. The cyclohexanone has the carbonyl at position 1. The substituents are at 2 (ethyl and methyl) and 6 (methyl). So the positions adjacent to the carbonyl are 2 and 6. So when forming the enolate, the base could deprotonate either position 2 or 6.

But the substituents at position 2 are more bulky. So the base would prefer the less hindered position, which is position 6, because
