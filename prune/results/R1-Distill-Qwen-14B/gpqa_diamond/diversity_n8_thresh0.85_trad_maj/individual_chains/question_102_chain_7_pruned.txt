Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this question. Let me start by reading it carefully and breaking it down.

So, the question is about a ligand-receptor pair expressed in neural crest cells and their developmental fate. The setup involves some genetic constructs and experiments.

First, the construct: it's a bicistronic lox-Cre vector. Bicistronic means it has two coding sequences, right? So the ligand's ORF is at the 5' end, fused to mCherry. The receptor is at the 3' end, fused to eGFP at the C-terminus. 

The ligand is under the CBA promoter. CBA is a strong promoter, I think it's a cytomegalovirus promoter. Then, upstream of the receptor is an IRES element. IRES allows for internal ribosome entry, so the receptor can be translated without the ribosomes terminating after the ligand's ORF. That's how bicistronic vectors workâ€”each gene is under its own promoter or uses an IRES.

Looking at the stops: between the ligand ORF and mCherry, there's a stop cassette with loxP. Similarly, between the receptor and eGFP, there's a stop with lox2272. So these are probably used for Cre-mediated recombination. Cre will excise the stop cassettes, allowing the fusion proteins (ligand-mCherry and receptor-eGFP) to be expressed.

They transfected the plasmid into primary astrocyte culture and used antibodies against the overexpressed proteins on a Western blot. The actin loading is proportional, so that's a control for loading. But in the mouse model, they crossed it with SOX10-Cre mice, which I think is a Cre line that's active in neural crest cells. Then they look for green signal under confocal, but don't see any.

So why no green?

The possible options are A to D. Let's think about each.

Option A: Ligand and receptor are paracrine. Paracrine means they act on nearby cells. So if the ligand is secreted and acts on neighboring cells, then the eGFP would be in the neighboring cells, not in the transfected ones. But wait, the vector is in primary astrocytes? Or in the mice? Hmm, the initial setup is that the construct is in a plasmid transfected into astrocytes. But the mouse model is homozygous for the construct, so perhaps it's integrated into the genome. Then they crossed with SOX10-Cre, which is probably under the control of SOX10 promoter, active in neural crest derivatives.

Wait, but the construct is in the mice, so when they use SOX10-Cre, which is a transgenic line where Cre is under SOX10 promoter. SOX10 is expressed in neural crest cells. So when Cre is expressed, it should recombine the lox sites.

But wait, the vector is lox-Cre, which I think is the Cre recombinase under a certain promoter. Wait, no, the vector is a bicistronic lox-Cre vector. Wait, maybe I'm getting confused. The vector has the loxP and lox2272 sites. The plasmid probably has the loxP-stop-loxP before mCherry and lox2272-stop-lox2272 before eGFP.

So when Cre is expressed, it will excise the stop cassettes, allowing the ligand-mCherry and receptor-eGFP to be expressed as fusion proteins.

But the mouse is homozygous for the construct. They crossed it with SOX10-Cre hemizygous mice. So the offspring would have the construct and SOX10-Cre. So in the offspring, the Cre would be expressed wherever SOX10 is expressed.

If the construct is in the mouse, then upon Cre expression, the stop cassettes are removed, so the ligand and receptor would be expressed as fusion proteins.

In the Western blot after transfection, I'm assuming the antibodies detected the proteins because the blot worked. But in the
