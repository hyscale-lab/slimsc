Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about stars and their effective temperatures. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's see if I can figure it out.

The question says that iron atoms in star_1's photosphere are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to star_2. Oh right, when they say "excited", I think they're talking about the population of a higher energy state relative to a lower one. And they give the energy difference between the levels as 1.38e-23 J.

The problem also states that the stellar photospheres are in LTE, which stands for Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium. So that means I can use the Boltzmann distribution to relate the populations of these energy levels. Right, the Boltzmann equation says that the ratio of the populations of two energy states is given by the Boltzmann factor.

The Boltzmann equation is n_upper / n_lower = exp( -ΔE / (k*T) ), where ΔE is the energy difference, k is Boltzmann's constant, and T is the temperature. Wait, but wait, actually the equation I remember is (n2)/(n1) = exp( -(E2 - E1)/(k T) ). So in this case, since ΔE is E2 - E1 (assuming E2 is higher), so the ratio is exp( -ΔE/(k T) ) .

But the problem states that the excitation in star_1 is twice that of star_2. So for star_1, the ratio is 2, and for star_2, it's 1 (since 2 is the ratio compared to star_2). Wait, no, wait: The ratio of the excited state to the ground state is given. So for star_1, n_upper / n_lower = 2, and for star_2, it's 1, perhaps? Or wait, perhaps star_1 has twice as much excitation as star_2. So maybe for star_1, the ratio is higher than star_2's.

Wait, the question says: "iron atoms in the photosphere of star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level when compared to star_2." So I think that means the population of the excited state in star_1 is twice that in star_2. But wait, actually, it's about the excitation, which is the ratio of the upper to lower level. So star_1 has a higher excitation (ratio) than star_2.

Wait no, wait. Let me clarify. The excitation level being twice as high would imply that the ratio of the upper to lower level (n_upper/n_lower) for star_1 is twice that of star_2. So let's define:

For star 1: (n_upper1)/(n_lower1) = R1 = 2 * (n_upper2)/(n_lower2) = 2 R2.

Wait, but wait, actually the problem says that for star_1, the excited state is twice as much as star_2. So perhaps R1 = 2 R2, where R is the ratio for each star.

But wait, no. The way it's phrased is that "iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level when compared to star_2." So perhaps R1 = 2 R2. But I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, maybe the number of excited atoms in star_1 is twice that in star_2. But perhaps that's not the right way to look at it because the total number of atoms would matter too. But the problem doesn't give any info about the total number of iron atoms in each photosphere, so perhaps the ratio is the key.

Wait, but according to the Boltzmann equation, the ratio R = n_upper / n_lower = exp( -ΔE/(k T) ). So for each star, their R depends on their temperature.

But wait, the problem states that for star_1, R1 is twice R2: R1 = 2 R2.

Wait, no. Wait, the problem says that the iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited. So perhaps R1 is twice R2. So R1 = 2 R2.

So, R1 = exp( -ΔE/(k T1) )

R2 = exp( -ΔE/(k T2) )

And R1 = 2 R2.

So substituting in:

exp( -ΔE/(k T1) ) = 2 * exp( -ΔE/(k T2) )

Hmm, let's write this equation down:

exp( -ΔE/(k T1) ) = 2 exp( -ΔE/(k T2) )

I can take the natural logarithm of both sides to simplify this.

Taking ln on both sides:

-ΔE/(k T1) = ln(2) + [ -ΔE/(k T2) ]

Hmm, rearranging terms:

-ΔE/(k T1) + ΔE/(k T2) = ln(2)

Factor out ΔE/(k):

ΔE/(k) [ 1/(T2) - 1/(T1) ] = ln(2)

Which can be written as:

ΔE/(k) [ (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) ) ] = ln(2)

Wait, let's double-check that algebra. Let me compute 1/T2 - 1/T1:

1/T2 - 1/T1 = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2 )

Yes, that's correct.

So, substituting back, we have:

ΔE/(k) * (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) ) = ln(2)

But wait, I can write this as:

(T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) ) = [ ln(2) * k ] / ΔE

Wait, but the problem gives ΔE as 1.38e-23 J. Wait, that's interesting because k is approximately 1.38e-23 J/K. Because Boltzmann's constant k is 1.380649e-23 J/K.

Wait a minute, so ΔE is given as 1.38e-23 J, which is exactly k in magnitude. So ΔE = k. Wait, no, the problem says 1.38e-23 J, which is the same as k (approx 1.38e-23 J/K). So that's probably a hint.

So then, the denominator in our equation is ΔE/(k) ) = (k )/(k) ) = 1.

So the equation simplifies to:

(T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) ) = ln(2 )

So rearranged:

ln(2) = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2 )

Which is the same as:

ln(2) = (T1 - T2) / (T1 T2 )

Looking at the options:

Option D is ln(2) = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2)

Which matches what I have here.

So the correct equation is option D.


The problem involves two stars in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE), where the excitation of iron atoms in star_1 is twice that of star_2. The energy difference between the energy levels is given as \( \Delta E = 1.38 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J} \), which matches the magnitude of Boltzmann's constant \( k \approx 1.38 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J/K} \). Using the Boltzmann distribution, the ratio of populations of the upper to lower energy levels is given by:

\[
\frac{n_{\text{upper}}}{n_{\text{lower}}} = \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{k T}\right).
\]

For star_1 and star_2, the excitation ratios are:

\[
R_1 = \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{k T_1}\right), \quad R_2 = \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{k T_2}\right).
\]

Since star_1's excitation is twice that of star_2, we have \( R_1 = 2 R_2 \). Substituting the expressions for \( R_1 \) and \( R_2 \):

\[
\exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{k T_1}\right) = 2 \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{k T_2}\right).
\]

Taking the natural logarithm of both sides:

\[
-\frac{\Delta E}{k T_1} = \ln(2) - \frac{\Delta E}{k T_2}.
\]

Rearranging terms:

\[
\frac{\Delta E}{k} \left(\frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1}\right) = \ln(2).
\]

Factoring \( \frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1} \):

\[
\frac{\Delta E}{k} \cdot \frac{T_1 - T_2}{T_1 T_2} = \ln(2).
\]

Since \( \Delta E = k \), the equation simplifies to:

\[
\frac{T_1 - T_2}{T_1 T_2} = \ln(2).
\]

This matches the form of option D:

\[
\ln(2) = \frac{T_1 - T_2}{T_1 T_2}.
\]

Thus, the correct equation for the effective temperatures of the stars is given by option D.

**Answer: D**
