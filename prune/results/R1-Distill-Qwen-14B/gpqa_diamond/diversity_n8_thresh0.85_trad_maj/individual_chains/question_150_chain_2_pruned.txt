Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. Let me try to figure it out step by step. Hmm, the question is about identifying a compound based on its NMR data and predicting the product after a series of reactions. 

First, let's look at the molecular formula: C8H9NO. That's 8 carbons, 9 hydrogens, one nitrogen, and one oxygen. Hmm, I wonder what kind of functional groups that could imply. The reagents involved are NaNO2 and HCl, then H2O, followed by aqueous KOH and heat. Oh wait, those reagents might be part of a substitution reaction or maybe something like a diazotization.

The NMR data is given. Let's break that down. The 1H-NMR shows:

- 9.72 ppm (t, 1H). That peak is probably an aldehyde proton because aldehydes are typically around 9-10 ppm. The triplet suggests coupling with two adjacent protons. But wait, aldehydes are usually deshielded and appear as singlets or maybe doublets if coupled with another proton. Hmm, maybe it's not an aldehyde. Alternatively, it could be an acidic proton like an alcohol or an aldehyde. Wait, but why a triplet? Maybe it's an aldehyde adjacent to a CH2 group. Like R-CHO where the CH2 is next to it, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe it's an aromatic ring with some substituents.

Wait, let me note the other peaks. 6.98 ppm (d, 2H) and 6.51 ppm (d, 2H). Those look like two doublets each integrating to 2H. That suggests a para-substituted aromatic ring. The 6.98 is more upfield than 6.51. So maybe two substituents on the benzene ring, each para to each other, leading to two doublets. So perhaps a benzene ring with two substituents in the para positions, but I'm not sure what those substituents are.

Then there's a peak at 6.27 ppm (bs, 2H). Broad singlet, integrating to 2H. Broad suggests maybe exchange with something else, like an -OH group. But it's a singlet, so maybe two equivalent protons not split by any neighboring Hs. That could be a CH2 group adjacent to something that causes the broadness, like an -OH group. Or perhaps it's a conjugated system with some diastereotopic protons.

The 3.66 ppm (d, 2H) seems like a CH2 group next to an electronegative atom. Maybe an OCH2 group or something like that. The doublet indicates two neighboring protons. So perhaps OCH2CH2... or maybe OCH2 attached to another group.

Putting this together: Maybe the molecule has a benzene ring with two substituents. One substituent is an amino group (since the molecular formula has a N and O). Wait, the formula is C8H9NO. So if there are two benzene rings, perhaps each has a substituent. Or maybe one benzene ring and another structure.

Wait, the molecular formula is C8H9NO. Let me think about possible structures. Let's see: Benzaldehyde derivatives perhaps. Alternatively
