Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I need to figure it out. Let's see what it's about. The question is about a Lagrangian in quantum field theory and determining the mass dimension of a coupling constant and whether the theory is renormalizable. Hmm, I remember that renormalizability has to do with the dimensions of the coupling constants. 

The Lagrangian given is L_int = κ ψ̄ σ_{μν} ψ F^{μν}. And σ_{μν} is defined as (i/2)[γ_μ, γ_ν], which I think are the commutators of the gamma matrices. Oh right, these sigma terms often show up in theories with spinor fields and antisymmetric tensors, maybe like in some gauge theories or maybe in the context of the Dirac equation with certain interactions.

So the first part is to find the mass dimension of κ. To find this, I need to know the dimensions of each term in the Lagrangian. Because in field theory, the Lagrangian has to be dimensionless in natural units (since the action S = ∫ L d^4x is dimensionless). So each term in the Lagrangian must have mass dimension [Lagrangian term] = 4, because the integral over dx^4 (which has dimension [mass]^{-4}) requires the integrand to have [mass]^4 to make everything dimensionless.

Wait, no, wait. Wait, the Lagrangian density has mass dimension 4 because when you integrate it over four dimensions, which each have dimension -1 in mass units (since [d^4x] = [mass]^{-4}), the integral becomes dimensionless. So each term in the Lagrangian has to have mass dimension 4.

So each term in L_int must have mass dimension 4. So for the term κ ψ̄ σ ψ F, each component's mass dimension should add up to 4.

Let me think about the fields. The Dirac spinor ψ has a mass dimension. I remember that for a Dirac spinor in 4D spacetime, the dimension is [ψ] = 3/2. Because the Dirac equation is (∂ - i m)ψ = 0, so the derivative has dimension 1, and m is dimension 1. So ψ must have dimension 3/2.

So ψ̄ (which is ψ† γ^0) will have the same dimension as ψ, which is 3/2.

Now the σ_{μν} term. Since it's made from the commutator of gamma matrices, which are dimensionless (they're just matrices), so σ_{μν} is dimensionless. So that part doesn't contribute any mass dimension.

Next, F^{μν} is the field strength tensor. Wait, for which field? Oh, wait, the Lagrangian term looks similar to a term involving the electromagnetic field tensor, or perhaps non-Abelian, but regardless, F^{μν} is a field strength tensor. For a gauge field A, F is ∂μ Aν - ∂ν Aμ + [A, A] terms, but in Abelian case, it's just ∂μ Aν - ∂ν Aμ. The dimension of A is [A] = 1, because in the Maxwell term, L is -(1/4) F_{μν} F^{μν}, and F has dimension 2 (since each derivative is dimension 1, and A is dimension 1, so each F has [∂A] = 1 + 1 = 2). So F^{μν} has dimension 2.

Wait, let me think again. The field strength tensor F for a gauge field A is something like ∂μ Aν - ∂ν Aμ. So each derivative is [∂] = mass^1. Each A is [A] = mass^{1} (since in 4D, the field A is a gauge field, like in electromagnetism; the photon has no mass but the field has dimension 1). So the F has [F] = [∂ A] = 1 + 1 = 2. So F^{
