Okay, so I have this question about optical isomerism in organic chemistry. Hmm, optical isomerism refers to compounds that are non-superimposable mirror images of each other, right? These are also called enantiomers. The presence of such isomers usually means the compound has a chiral center, a carbon atom bonded to four different groups.

The question lists four different organic moieties and asks which show optical isomerism. Let me go through each one by one.

1. **dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate**. Biphenyl compounds can sometimes have stereoisomerism due to the rotation around the central bond. But wait, in biphenyls, the substituents are on each benzene ring. If the two rings have identical substituents in a symmetrical arrangement, then there might not be any optical isomerism. Here, the substituents are 6,6'-dinitro and 2,2'-dicarboxylate. So each benzene ring has a nitro at position 6 and a carboxylate methyl ester at position 2. Are these positions symmetrical? Let me think. For a 1,1'-biphenyl, the two benzene rings are connected at position 1. So if each has a nitro at 6 and carboxylate at 2, maybe the molecule has a plane of symmetry. Wait, if the substituents on each ring are the same, then perhaps it's symmetrical, and thus no chiral centers. Alternatively, maybe the arrangement allows for a plane of symmetry, making the molecule achiral. Or does the arrangement lead to a chiral structure?

Wait, no. Wait, the biphenyl itself can have E and Z configurations based on the substituents. Oh wait, no, that's about constitutional isomerism in some cases. Alternatively, if the substituents on each phenyl ring are such that the molecule isn't symmetrical, then the molecule could have stereoisomerism. Let me think again. The substituents are at positions 2 and 6 on each ring. For biphenyl, the positions around the central bond (1 and 1') are arranged. So if each ring has substituents at 2 and 6, which are para to each other on the benzene ring, then perhaps the molecule is symmetrical. So both rings have the same substituents. Thus, perhaps the molecule is symmetrical, leading to the possibility of being achiral. But wait, what about the possibility of the two substituents on each ring creating a chiral center elsewhere?

Alternatively, maybe looking at the biphenyl system, the two substituents on each ring are such that the molecule can't have a plane of symmetry, leading to a chiral center. Alternatively, perhaps the molecule has an internal plane of symmetry, making it achiral. Hmm, I'm a bit confused here. Maybe I should move on and come back.

2. **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**. The structure here is CH3CO-O-C(CH3)(OH)CH3? Wait, no, wait. Let me draw it. 2-hydroxypropanoate would be the ester of 2-hydroxypropanoic acid. So the acid is HOOC-CH(OH)-CH3, but as an ester, it's CH3O-CO-CH(OH)-CH3? Wait, no. Wait, 2-hydroxypropanoic acid is CH2(OH)CH2COOH, but wait, no. Wait, propanoic acid is CH2CH2COOH, so 2-hydroxypropanoic acid is CH2(OH)CH2COOH? Wait, no. Propanoic acid is CH3CH2COOH. So 2-hydroxy would be on the second carbon: CH2(OH)CH2COOH. Wait no, wait, wait. Let me think again. Propanoate is a three-carbon chain. So propanoic acid is CH2CH2COOH, but the structure is CH3CH2COOH. So 2-hydroxypropanoic acid would be CH2(OH)CH2COOH? No, wait that's four carbons. Wait, wait, wait. Let me correct this. Propanoic acid is CH3CH2COOH. So the second carbon is the middle CH2. So 2-hydroxy would be on that, so structure is CH2(OH)CH2COOH. As an ester, it's methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate, so the structure would be CH3O-CO-CH(CH2OH)CH3? No, wait. Wait, the propanoate is CH3CH(OH)COOCH3. So the structure is methyl ester, so the ester group is OMe attached to the carbonyl. The structure would have the carbonyl, then a CH(OH) group, then another CH3. Wait, wait, maybe it's better to think in terms of whether that structure has a chiral center.

So the molecule is CH3O-CO-CH(OH)CH3. No, wait, perhaps it's CH3O-CO-CH(CH2OH)2? No, wait, 2-hydroxypropanoate would have the structure:

The acid is CH2(OH)CH2COOH. Wait, no, that's butanoic acid. Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me think again. For 2-hydroxypropanoic acid, the structure is:

Carbon chain: COOH-CH(OH)-CH3? Wait, no. Wait, propanoic acid is CH2CH2COOH. So 2-hydroxy would be on the second carbon, which is CH2 in CH3-CH2-COOH. So adding a hydroxyl on the second carbon: CH3-CH(OH)-COOH. So as an ester, it's methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate, which would be CH3-O-CO-CH(OH)-CH3. So the structure is:

O
||
O-C-OCH3
|
CH(OH)CH3

Wait, no. The correct structure is:

The propanoate ester would have the structure: O
          ||
O-C-OCH3 connected to a CH(OH)CH3 group. So the carbonyl is attached to the ester oxygen and to a CH(OH)CH3 group.

Wait, no, wait. The ester is formed from the acid and an alcohol. So the acid is CH3CH(OH)COOH, and the ester would be CH3CH(OH)COOCH3.

So the structure is:

O
||
O-C-OCH3
|
CH(OH)CH3

Wait, no. Wait, the carbonyl is part of the ester, so the structure should be:

COOCH3
|
CH(OH)CH2-

Wait, maybe my approach is wrong. Let's think about the molecule's structure. The key is whether it has a chiral center. The molecule is methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate. So the structure is: 

The ester group is OMe-O-CO-.

The propanoate part comes from propanoic acid, which is CH2CH2COOH. 2-hydroxy would be on the second carbon, so the structure is CH2(OH)CH2COOH. As the ester, it becomes CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3.

Wait, no, that's four carbons, but propanoate is three. Wait, perhaps I'm getting mixed up here. Let me think of the structure. 2-hydroxypropanoate would be:

The acid: CH3-CH(OH)-COOH. As an ester, it's CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3.

So the structure is:

COOCH3
|
CH(OH)
|
CH3

Wait, that doesn't make sense. Wait, perhaps it's CH3-C(OH)H-CO-OCH3. Wait, no. Let me try to write it properly. Maybe it's:

The ester is formed from 2-hydroxypropanoic acid, which is CH3-CH(OH)-COOH. The ester would have the structure CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3. So looking at the structure, the central carbon (the CH(OH)) is connected to:

- CH3 (one group)
- OH (second)
- COOCH3 (third)
- And what's the fourth? Wait, wait no. Let me count. The central carbon is the second carbon in propanoate. So it's connected to:

1. A methyl group (CH3)
2. An OH group
3. The carbonyl oxygen (which is part of the ester group, so the COOCH3 is connected via a single bond)
4. So wait, that's three substituents. Wait, I'm getting confused again. Alternatively, perhaps the structure is:

The molecule is CH3CH(OH)COOCH3. So the central carbon (the second carbon) is attached to:

- CH3 (from the first carbon)
- OCH3 (from the ester?)
Wait, no. Let me think of the structure as CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3. So the second carbon (the OH) has four substituents: 

1. CH3 (from the first carbon)
2. OH
3. COOCH3 (from the third carbon)
4. And another CH3? No, wait. Wait, the molecule is CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3. Let's break it down:

The carbon chain is:

Carbon 1: CH3-
Carbon 2: -CH(OH)- 
Carbon 3: -COOCH3

Wait, so Carbon 2 is connected to:

- Carbon 1 (CH3)
- OH
- Carbon 3 (COOCH3)
- And what else? Oh wait, Carbon 2 is also bonded to another group. Wait, no, Carbon 2 is CH, so it's bonded to three groups: CH3, OH, and COOCH3. But wait, that would be three substituents. Wait, no, each carbon is bonded to four groups. Wait, perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, Carbon 2 is the central atom. Let me think: Each carbon in the chain would be:

Carbon 1: CH3-
Carbon 2: CH(OH)-
Carbon 3: COOCH3

But Carbon 2 is bonded to:

- Carbon 1 (CH3)
- OH
- Carbon 3 (COOCH3)
- And another H?

Wait, no. So the structure is CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3.

So Carbon 2 is CH, so it has bonds to Carbon 1 (CH3), OH, Carbon 3 (COOCH3), and a hydrogen.

Wait, but then Carbon 2 is bonded to four groups: CH3, OH, COOCH3, and H. So is that a chiral center? Because four different substituents.

Wait, CH3, OH, COOCH3, and H. Are all four groups different? Yes. So that would make it a chiral center. Hence, the molecule would have optical isomerism.

So number 2 is an optical isomer.

3. **benzophenone**. Benzophenone is (Ph)2CO. So it's a ketone with two phenyl groups attached to the carbonyl. The structure is O=C(Ph)2. Now, does this have any chiral centers? Well, the central carbon is double-bonded to O and attached to two phenyl groups. So no, the central carbon is not a chiral center because it's double-bonded (so it's a trigonal planar geometry, not tetrahedral). So no chiral centers, hence no optical isomerism.

But wait, could there be another source of chirality? For example, if the substituents are arranged in a way that creates a plane of symmetry. Benzophenone is symmetrical because it has two identical phenyl groups. So even if the molecule were to rotate, it's symmetrical, so no enantiomers. Hence, no optical isomerism.

4. **dimethyl fumarate**. Fumarate is the trans diastereomer of maleate. The structure is (Z)-butenedioic acid. So dimethyl fumarate would be the diester, with the structure CH2CH(COOCH3)CH2COOCH3, but wait, wait. No, the structure is actually:

The fumarate is the trans isomer, so the two double bonds are opposite. So the structure is:

COOCH3
||
CH2-CH2
    \ /
     C=O (as ester groups)

Wait, no, fumarate is the trans-1,2-dicarboxy ethylene. So the structure is CH2(COOCH3)-CH2(COOCH3), but with a double bond. Wait, no, fumaric acid is HOOC-CHCH-COOH, with the double bond in the trans configuration.

So the dimethyl ester would be CH2(COOCH3)CH2(COOCH3), but with a double bond between the central carbons. So it's:

COOCH3
   \ /
CH2-CH2
But wait, no, that's not exactly right. Fumarate is trans, so the two COOCH3 groups are on opposite sides of the double bond. So the structure is:

CH2(COOCH3)
   \   /
    C=C
   /   \
CH2(COOCH3)

Wait, but when making the ester, each carboxylic acid becomes a COOCH3. So the structure is CH2(COOCH3)-CH2(COOCH3) with a double bond in between.

Wait, no, fumarate is trans, so the arrangement is:

O
||
O-COOCH3
       \
        C=C
       /
      O-COOCH3

Wait, perhaps more accurately, it's:

CH2(COOCH3)-CH2(COOCH3) with the double bond between the CH2 groups. No, that's not correct. Let me think again.

Wait, fumaric acid is HO2C-CHCH-COOH, with the two COOH groups on opposite sides (trans). So the dimethyl ester would be (CH2(COOCH3)) on each end of the double bond. So it's:

COOCH3
  \
CH2-C=C-CH2
  /
COOCH3

Wait, no, the structure is more accurately represented as CH2(COOCH3)=CH(COOCH3), but in the trans configuration. So each CH2 group is connected to COOCH3, and the double bond is between the two CH groups.

Wait, maybe it's:

COOCH3
   \ 
CH2-C=C-CH2
   /
COOCH3

But in reality, the two COOCH3 groups are on the same carbon? No, wait, wait. Fumarate is the trans isomer of butenedioic acid. So the structure is HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH but with a double bond. No, wait, no. Wait, butenedioic acid is HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH with a double bond between the two CH2 groups, but that's not correct. Wait, no, fumaric acid is HOOC-CH=CH-COOH, with the two COOH groups on either end of the double bond.

So the dimethyl ester is MeOOC-CH=CH-COOMe. The substituents on each double bond carbon are: one COOCH3, and two methyl groups? No, wait. Each double bond carbon is attached to a COOCH3 group and a CH3 group? No, wait, no. Each double bond carbon is connected to one COOCH3 and another CH3?

Wait, no. Wait, the structure of fumaric acid is HOOC-CH=CH-COOH. So when it forms the dimethyl ester, each COOH becomes COOCH3. So the structure is CH2(COOCH3)=CH(COOCH3)? No, wait, the double bond is between the two CH groups. So the structure is:

COOCH3
   \
CH2-CH=CH-CH2
   /
COOCH3

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck, but let's think about whether dimethyl fumarate has any stereocenters or geometric isomerism. Wait, the question is about optical isomerism, which is about enantiomers, not geometric isomerism.

Wait, but dimethyl fumarate is the trans isomer. So if the molecule has a plane of symmetry, it might not be chiral. Let me see: the molecule has the two COOCH3 groups on opposite sides of the double bond. So each CH is connected to COOCH3 and another CH which is connected to another COOCH3.

Wait, no, each double bond carbon is attached to one COOCH3 and a CH2 group.

Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think about whether the molecule has a chiral center. For that, a carbon must be attached to four different groups. In dimethyl fumarate, the double bond is between two carbons, each of which is connected to two COOCH3 groups? No, each is connected to a COOCH3 and another CH group. Wait, in fumarate, the structure is:

O
||
O-C-OCH3 connected to a CH which is double-bonded to another CH which is connected to another COOCH3.

Wait, perhaps each double bond carbon has a COOCH3 group and another CH group. Wait, perhaps the structure is:

COOCH3
   \
CH2-CH2
   /
COOCH3

But with a double bond between the CH2 groups. No, that's not right.

Wait, perhaps the structure of dimethyl fumarate is:

CH2(COOCH3)-CH2(COOCH3), but with a double bond between the two CH2 groups, making it CH2(COOCH3)=CH2(COOCH3). Hmm, no, that would make each CH2 carry two COOCH3 groups, which is not correct.

Wait, perhaps I should think differently. Fumarate is the trans isomer of maleate. Maleate is the cis isomer. So dimethyl fumarate has the same groups on each end but opposite configurations.

Wait, does that make the molecule chiral? Let me think: the molecule would have a center of symmetry. Because in the trans configuration, the two COOCH3 groups are on opposite sides, so the molecule may have a plane of symmetry, making it achiral. So, no, it's not a chiral molecule. Therefore, it doesn't have optical isomerism. Wait, but wait, wait. Wait, the double bond in fumarate is trans, but in terms of symmetry, maybe the molecule is symmetrical.

Wait, because the substituents are the same on both ends, and in a trans configuration, the molecule would be symmetrical along the plane bisecting the double bond. So, it's not chiral. Hence, no optical isomerism.

Wait, but another thought: if the molecule's substituents are not symmetrical, perhaps it can have a chiral center. Wait, but in dimethyl fumarate, each CH has the same substituents. Let me think: each CH is attached to a COOCH3 and another CH which is attached to another COOCH3.

Wait, perhaps the molecule doesn't have any chiral centers because each CH is attached to two identical groups (COOCH3 and another CH with COOCH3). So no, each carbon in the double bond is CH, which is connected to two identical groups (each CH is attached to a COOCH3 and another CH which is connected to COOCH3). So each of those carbons is CH2? No, wait, maybe each is CH.

Wait, maybe each double bond carbon is connected to two groups: a COOCH3 and a CH2 group. So maybe it's CH2(COOCH3)=CH2(COOCH3). That would make each CH2 connected to COOCH3 and another CH2, but in a trans configuration. Hmm, but does that create a chiral center? No, because each CH2 is connected to two identical groups (COOCH3 and another CH2). So no chiral centers.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule is symmetrical, leading to no optical isomerism.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit stuck. Maybe I should think about the possible answers.

The options are:

A) 1,2,4
B) 3,4
C) 2,3
D)1,2

So, from earlier analysis, number 2 has optical isomerism. Number 4, I'm not sure. Number 1, I'm not sure. Number 3, no.

So looking at the options, which include 2 and 4.

Option A includes 2 and 4. Option D includes 1 and 2. So which is correct.

Wait, let me go back to number 4. Dimethyl fumarate is the trans isomer. So the structure is CH2(COOCH3)-CH2(COOCH3) with a double bond. Wait, no. Let me correct myself. Fumarate is HOOC-CH=CH-COOH. So the dimethyl ester is MeOOC-CH=CH-COOME. So each CH is attached to a COOCH3 and a CH.

Wait, no, each CH is connected to a COOCH3 and a CH2 group?

Wait, perhaps the structure is:

O
||
O-C-OCH3 connected to CH, which is double-bonded to another CH connected to O-C-OCH3.

So the structure is:

O
||
O-C-OCH3-CH2-CH2-CO-OCH3
But with a double bond.

Wait, no, the correct structure for dimethyl fumarate is:

CH2(COOCH3)=CH(COOCH3)

Wait, but each CH is connected to a COOCH3 and another CH. So each CH is connected to two COOCH3 groups and a double bond. So each carbon in the double bond has the same substituents: COOCH3 and another CH. So no, each of those carbons is attached to two identical groups (COOCH3 and CH), so they're not chiral centers.

Wait, but wait a minute. In that case, the molecule doesn't have any chiral centers, so no optical isomerism. Therefore, number 4 doesn't exhibit optical isomerism either.

So, the only one so far that does is number 2.

Wait, what about number 1 again. dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate.

Biphenyl structure: two benzene rings connected at position 1. Each ring has a nitro group at position 6 and a carboxylate methyl ester at position 2.

Wait, position 2 on each ring would be ortho to the connecting position (position 1), and position 6 is para to position 2 on each ring.

So, each benzene ring has substituents at positions 2 and 6. So the substituents on each ring are at 2 (carboxylate) and 6 (nitro), which are para to each other.

So the biphenyl has substituents at 2 and 6 on each ring.

Wait, if each ring has the same substituents, then the molecule might have a plane of symmetry. So, perhaps the molecule is symmetrical and thus not chiral. But wait, if the substituents are in such a way that there's no plane of symmetry, then the molecule could be chiral.

Wait, perhaps if the substituents on each ring are in the same relative positions, the molecule as a whole might not be chiral. Alternatively, perhaps the substituents create a chiral environment.

Alternatively, perhaps the biphenyl system itself can have enantiomers if the substituents are arranged asymmetrically.

Wait, in biphenyl, the two rings can rotate with respect to each other, but for some substituents, this rotation might lead to different configurations.

Wait, but in this case, each ring has substituents at positions 2 and 6, which are para to each other. So for each ring, substituents are in the same positions, so when you look at the entire molecule, perhaps the substituents are arranged symmetrically.

But wait, if each ring has substituents at 2 and 6, then the arrangement could be such that the molecule is symmetrical, making it achiral. For example, in the case where the substituents on each ring are in the same positions relative to the central bond, the molecule may have a plane of symmetry, thus being achiral.

Alternatively, if the substituents on each ring are in different positions, the molecule could be chiral.

In this case, since substituents are at 2 and 6 on each ring, perhaps the molecule is symmetrical, leading to no optical isomerism.

Wait, but I might be wrong. Sometimes, even with substituents on each ring, the molecule can have a chiral center elsewhere. But in this case, the substituents are on the benzene rings; benzene rings themselves don't create chiral centers unless there's another group attached.

Wait, the substituents are nitro and carboxylate groups. Nitro is a strong substituent, but it's a flat group (planar). The carboxylate ester is also planar. So, perhaps the molecule is symmetrical and thus not chiral.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule has a chiral center in the biphenyl system. Wait, but biphenyls don't have chiral centers in themselves; the chirality arises if the substituents are arranged in a way that creates a non-superimposable mirror image.

Wait, another approach: does the molecule have a plane of symmetry? If it does, then it's not chiral. If it doesn't, then it's chiral.

In this case, the substituents on each ring are at 2 and 6, which are para positions. So when looking at the biphenyl, each ring has a nitro and a carboxylate at para positions relative to each other. So perhaps the molecule is symmetrical, and hence not chiral.

Therefore, number 1 doesn't exhibit optical isomerism.

So, going back to the options, only number 2 (methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate) exhibits optical isomerism.

Looking at the options:

A) 1,2,4 → includes 1 and 4 which I don't think are correct.

B) 3 and4 → neither correct.

C) 2 and3 → 3 is not correct.

D) 1 and 2 → 1 is not correct.

Wait, none of the options match just 2. So perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, maybe I missed something. Let me see again.

Number 4: dimethyl fumarate.

If the ester is in the trans configuration, does that make the molecule chiral? No, because the molecule has a plane of symmetry. So no optical isomerism.

Wait, but wait. Another possibility is that the molecule has a center of chirality. Let me think about the structure again.

Structure of dimethyl fumarate:

COOCH3
   \
CH2-C=C-CH2
   /
COOCH3

Wait, that's a four-carbon chain with double bond in the middle and COOCH3 groups on each end. But in the trans configuration, the two COOCH3 groups are on opposite sides of the double bond. So the molecule is symmetrical, hence not chiral. So no optical isomerism.

So only number 2 exhibits optical isomerism. But then none of the options have only 2. Looking back at the options:

Option A) 1,2,4 → includes 2 and 4.

Option A is not correct because I think 4 doesn't have it.

Option D) 1 and 2 → but I think 1 doesn't have it.

Hmm. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake with number 4.

Wait, another thought: in dimethyl fumarate, the substituents on each double bond carbon are COOCH3 and a CH2 group. So each double bond carbon is attached to COOCH3 and CH2. So both substituents are same on each, meaning no chiral centers.

No, so that doesn't create any.

Wait, perhaps I should think about whether any of the other compounds have optical isomerism.

What about number 3, benzophenone? No, it's a planar molecule, so no chirality.

Back to number 1: dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate.

Wait, perhaps the biphenyl has substituents in such a way that the molecule is not symmetrical, leading to a chiral center elsewhere. For example, the substituents on each ring are at 2 and 6, but if their positions relative to the central bond are such that the molecule lacks a plane of symmetry, then it could be chiral.

Wait, imagine the biphenyl with substituents at 2 (carboxylate) on each ring, and 6 (nitro) on each ring. The question is whether the arrangement allows a plane of symmetry.

Let me visualize the biphenyl: each benzene ring has substituents at 2 and 6. So, for each ring, substituents are at 2 and 6. So, if I imagine the two rings connected at position 1, substituents at 2 would be adjacent to the connecting bond on each ring.

But in this arrangement, would the molecule have a plane of symmetry?

Wait, if the substituents on each ring are in the same relative positions, perhaps the molecule is symmetrical. For instance, if the substituents on each ring are both in the same spatial arrangement, then the molecule could have a plane of symmetry through the central bond.

But I'm not entirely confident. Alternatively, perhaps the substituents create a chiral environment.

Wait, another approach: if the substituents on the biphenyl are in positions that make the molecule asymmetrical, then the molecule would have a chiral center. Wait, but biphenyls themselves don't have a chiral center; the substituents create chirality.

Wait, perhaps in this case, the substituents are arranged in such a way that the molecule is not symmetrical, thus making it chiral.

For example, the substituents on each ring may be at positions that create a non-symmetrical arrangement. So, the molecule could be chiral, leading to optical isomerism.

If that's the case, then number 1 would have optical isomerism.

So, if number 1 and 2 have optical isomerism, which is option D.

But earlier I thought number 1 might not. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituents on each ring are arranged such that the molecule is symmetrical, making it achiral.

Wait, but in the case of 6,6' and 2,2' substituents, each ring has substituents at positions 2 and 6, which are para to each other. So each ring has substituents in the same positions relative to each other and the connecting bond. So the entire molecule would have a plane of symmetry through the central bond. Hence, no chirality.

In that case, number 1 doesn't have optical isomerism.

So back to the options. Only number 2 has optical isomerism, but the given options don't have an option with only 2.

Wait, looking again at the options:

A) 1,2,4: 2 is correct, but 1 and 4 are uncertain.

B)3 and4: I think no.

C)2 and3: 3 is no.

D)1 and2: 1 uncertain.

So perhaps I need to think again.

Wait, perhaps number 4 does have optical isomerism. How?

Wait, dimethyl fumarate is the trans isomer of dimethyl maleate. Maleate is the cis isomer. Wait, no, fumarate is the trans, and maleate is the cis.

Wait, but fumarate itself isn't chiral. Because in the trans configuration, the substituents are on opposite sides, making the molecule symmetrical.

Wait, unless the molecule isn't symmetrical. So, for example, if each of the double bond carbons is connected to different groups, but in such a way that the overall molecule is not symmetrical.

Wait, the structure is CH2(COOCH3)=CH(COOCH3) in the trans configuration, but perhaps each CH is connected to more than just COOCH3.

Wait, no, each CH would be connected to COOCH3 and another group, like a hydrogen. Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused.

Alternatively, perhaps I should think of the structure as:

COOCH3
   \
CH2-CH2
   /
COOCH3

But with a double bond in the middle. So the structure is CH2(COOCH3)=CH2(COOCH3). Wait, but that doesn't make sense because each double bond carbon would need to have two substituents.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. The key is whether dimethyl fumarate has a chiral center. Since each double bond carbon is attached to two COOCH3 groups, it doesn't have a chiral center. So no optical isomerism.

Therefore, only number 2 has optical isomerism.

But none of the options have only 2. Hmm. Wait, perhaps I missed another possibility.

Wait, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate. Let me think again. The structure is CH3-O-CO-CH(OH)-CH3.

Wait, no, the correct structure is CH3-O-CO-CH2-CH(OH)2? No, I'm getting confused again.

Wait, perhaps the structure is:

The ester is from 2-hydroxypropanoic acid, which is CH3-C(OH)H-COOH. As an ester, it's CH3-C(OH)H-COOCH3.

So the central carbon (the one with the OH) is attached to:

- CH3 (from the first carbon)
- OH
- COOCH3 (from the third carbon)
- And another H?

Wait, no, the central carbon is the second carbon in the chain. Let me structure it as:

CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3.

So the second carbon is connected to:

- CH3 (from the first carbon)
- OH
- COOCH3 (from the third carbon)
- And a hydrogen.

So, four substituents: CH3, OH, COOCH3, and H. All four are different. Hence, a chiral center exists. So yes, number 2 has optical isomerism.

Now, considering the options, which include 2 as correct, but not any other.

Looking at the options:

A) 1,2,4 → includes 2, but I'm not sure about 1 and 4.

B)3 and4 → no.

C)2 and3 → no.

D)1 and2 → but 1 may not have it.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake with number 1. Let me try to think again.

Number 1: dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate.

The biphenyl has substituents at 2 and 6 on each ring. Each ring has a nitro at 6 and a carboxylate at 2.

Wait, perhaps if the substituents on one ring are in the same positions as the other, the entire molecule is symmetrical. For example, if both rings have the same substituents in the same positions, the molecule would have a plane of symmetry, making it achiral.

But if the substituents are arranged such that one ring has the nitro in a position that's not mirrored on the other ring, then the molecule would be chiral.

Wait, but in this case, each ring has substituents at 2 and 6, which are para to each other. So each ring has the same substituent arrangement. Thus, the molecule is symmetrical, meaning it's not chiral.

Therefore, number 1 doesn't have optical isomerism.

Thus, only number 2 has optical isomerism. But the options don't have an option where only 2 is correct. Wait, looking back at the options, perhaps I missed something.

Wait, the options are:

A) 1, 2 and4

B)3 and4

C)2 and3

D)1 and2

Hmm, so none of the options have only 2. So perhaps I made a mistake in analysis.

Wait, another thought: number 4, dimethyl fumarate, is a diastereomer of dimethyl maleate, but that's about geometric isomerism, not optical. Optical isomerism is about enantiomers.

Wait, but wait. Maybe dimethyl fumarate is a meso compound, but that would require multiple stereocenters but with a plane of symmetry.

Wait, no, because in dimethyl fumarate, there are no stereocenters. So the molecule itself is not a meso compound.

Wait, perhaps I should consider whether the molecule has a plane of symmetry. For example, in a molecule where substituents are arranged symmetrically, it would be achiral.

So, in this case, number 4 is achiral, so no optical isomerism.

So, only number 2 has optical isomerism.

But the options don't have a choice that includes only 2. So perhaps I made a mistake in my earlier analysis.

Wait, let me think again about number 4. Maybe I was wrong.

Wait, dimethyl fumarate's structure is CH2(COOCH3)=CH(COOCH3), trans. So each CH has a COOCH3 and a CH2 group.

Wait, but each CH is connected to COOCH3 and CH2. So each CH is connected to two different groups. Wait, if each CH has the same groups, then they're not chiral centers.

Wait, maybe the molecule is symmetrical, so no optical isomerism.

Thus, only number 2.

But the options don't have that. So perhaps the correct answer is option A, but that would include 4 which I think doesn't have it.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake and number 4 does have optical isomerism.

Wait, another approach: some esters can have optical isomerism if their structure creates a chiral center. For example, in dimethyl fumarate, perhaps the double bond's substituents create a situation where the molecule is chiral.

Wait, no, because the substituents are the same on both ends.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the possibility of the molecule being planar. If the molecule is planar, it cannot be chiral, but if it's not, then it could be.

Wait, but fumarate's structure is such that the molecule is trans, making it planar, hence not chiral.

So, I'm confident that number 2 is the only one with optical isomerism. But the options don't have that. Therefore, perhaps the correct option is A, which includes 2, but also 1 and 4.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake about number 1. Let me think again.

Number 1's structure: each ring has a nitro at 6 and a carboxylate at 2. So, on each ring, the substituents are para to each other. So, the entire molecule would have a plane of symmetry, making it achiral. Thus, number 1 doesn't have optical isomerism.

So, I think the correct answer is that only number 2 exhibits optical isomerism. But since none of the options match, perhaps I made a mistake somewhere.

Wait, perhaps I should reevaluate the options. Oh, wait, the options are:

A) 1,2,4

B)3 and4

C)2 and3

D)1 and2

So, if only number 2 is correct, but none of the options have that, perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, another possibility: number 4 might have a chiral center elsewhere. Let me think: dimethyl fumarate's structure is CH2(COOCH3)-CH2(COOCH3), but with a double bond. No, that's not correct. Alternatively, perhaps the substituents on the double bond are different.

Wait, perhaps the structure is CH2(COOCH3)=CH(COOCH3), but in the trans configuration. Each CH is connected to COOCH3 and another CH. So, each CH is connected to two COOCH3 groups and a CH.

Wait, no, each CH is connected to a COOCH3 and a CH2 group. So each CH has different substituents: COOCH3 and CH2. Thus, each CH would be a chiral center.

Wait, wait a second! If each CH is attached to different groups, then they would be chiral centers. So, in dimethyl fumarate, each double bond carbon is connected to:

- One COOCH3 group.

- One CH2 group (from the other end of the double bond).

Wait, but that would mean each CH is connected to COOCH3 and another CH2 group. So each CH would have substituents: COOCH3, CH2, and two other groups (like a hydrogen and another substituent). Hmm, perhaps I'm getting confused.

Wait, no, each CH in the double bond is connected to:

- COOCH3 group.

- Another CH group (from the other side of the double bond), which is attached to another COOCH3.

Wait, perhaps each CH is connected to COOCH3 and another CH, but that CH is also connected to another COOCH3.

Wait, in that case, each CH would be connected to two COOCH3 groups and two CH groups. So, if each CH is connected to two identical groups, then they're not chiral centers.

But wait, in the trans configuration, each CH would have the same groups, making them not chiral centers.

Thus, number 4 would not have optical isomerism.

So, the only correct answer is number 2.

But the options don't have that, so perhaps I made a mistake in the analysis of number 1.

Wait, perhaps number 1 has a chiral center elsewhere. Wait, perhaps the ester groups are arranged in such a way that the molecule isn't symmetrical.

Wait, each ring has a carboxylate ester at position 2 and a nitro at 6. So, the substituents on each ring are in the same positions, but perhaps their arrangement in space makes the molecule asymmetrical.

Wait, the biphenyl can rotate, but if the substituents are in positions that prevent a plane of symmetry, the molecule could be chiral.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituents on each ring are in a way that creates a chiral center in the biphenyl system.

Wait, I'm not very confident about this part, but perhaps the molecule is chiral, making number 1 exhibit optical isomerism.

If that's the case, then number 1 and 2 have optical isomerism, which is option D.

But earlier I thought number 1 was symmetrical, so I'm not sure.

In the absence of a clear conclusion, perhaps the correct answer includes number 2 and 4. But I'm not confident about that.

Wait, another angle: for a molecule to exhibit optical isomerism, it must have a chiral center or some other form of chirality (like axial chirality). In the case of biphenyls, if the substituents are arranged in a way that creates a chiral axis, then the molecule could be chiral.

Axial chirality occurs when a molecule has a helix-like structure, such as in allenes or biphenyls with appropriate substituents.

In biphenyl compounds, if the substituents on each ring are arranged in a way that the molecule cannot be superimposed on its mirror image, it can exhibit optical isomerism.

In this case, the substituents are at positions 2 and 6 on each ring. If the arrangement of these substituents creates a chiral axis, then the biphenyl would exhibit optical isomerism.

So, in this case, the substituents are at 2 and 6 on each ring. If the substituents are in such a way that their arrangement around the central bond creates a chiral environment, then the molecule would have optical isomerism.

Thus, number 1 would exhibit optical isomerism.

Therefore, numbers 1 and 2 have optical isomerism, making option D the correct answer.


To determine which of the given organic moieties exhibit optical isomerism, we analyze each compound for the presence of chirality. Optical isomerism arises when a compound has a non-superimposable mirror image, typically due to the presence of a chiral center or another form of chirality, such as axial chirality.

### Analysis of Each Compound:

1. **dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate**  
   This compound consists of a biphenyl system with substituents at positions 2 and 6 on each benzene ring. Each ring has a nitro group at position 6 and a carboxylate methyl ester at position 2. The substituents on each ring are para to each other. The molecule may lack a plane of symmetry due to the arrangement of the substituents, potentially making it chiral. This compound could exhibit optical isomerism.

2. **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**  
   The structure of this ester is CH3-O-CO-CH(OH)-CH3. The central carbon (the second carbon in the chain) is bonded to four different groups: CH3, OH, COOCH3, and H. This makes it a chiral center, and the compound exhibits optical isomerism.

3. **benzophenone**  
   Benzophenone has the structure (Ph)2CO, where Ph represents a phenyl group. The central carbon is double-bonded to oxygen and attached to two identical phenyl groups. This structure lacks a chiral center and is symmetrical, so it does not exhibit optical isomerism.

4. **dimethyl fumarate**  
   Dimethyl fumarate is the trans isomer of dimethyl maleate. Its structure is CH2(COOCH3)=CH(COOCH3) in the trans configuration. Each carbon in the double bond is bonded to a COOCH3 group and a CH2 group. Since the substituents on each carbon are identical, there are no chiral centers, and the molecule is symmetrical. Therefore, it does not exhibit optical isomerism.

### Conclusion:
- Compound 1 may exhibit optical isomerism due to the potential lack of symmetry in the biphenyl system.  
- Compound 2 exhibits optical isomerism due to the presence of a chiral center.  
- Compounds 3 and 4 do not exhibit optical isomerism.  

From the given options, the correct answer is **D) 1 and 2**, as both compounds 1 and 2 can exhibit optical isomerism.

Answer: D
