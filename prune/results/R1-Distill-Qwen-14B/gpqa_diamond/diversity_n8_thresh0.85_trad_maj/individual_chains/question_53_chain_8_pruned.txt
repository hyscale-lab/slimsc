Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. Let me try to figure it out step by step. Hmm, the question is about determining the chemical formula of a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring compound. The clues come from the FTIR and 1H NMR spectra.

First, the FTIR shows peaks for an ester group. Esters have a carbonyl group, usually around 1700-1750 cm^-1. So that means the compound has an ester functional group. Esters are typically R-O-CO-O-R' structures, but wait, no, wait. Oh right, esters are R-O-CO-R'. So the structure would have an ester linkage.

Now, looking at the NMR. The 1H NMR has six signals, which suggests there are six different types of protons. Let's break down what each part of the NMR tells us.

The aromatic region: two signals for aromatic H. A di-substituted benzene ring... Wait, but di-substituted benzene would have two substituents. Depending on their positions, the ring's symmetry can change. For example, if it's para-substituted, the two substituents are opposite each other, leading to two sets of aromatic protons. Because in para substitution, the ring is symmetric, so the two H environments are each equivalent. Wait, no. Wait, if it's di-substituted, like two groups attached to adjacent carbons, that's ortho; or opposite, which is para. For benzene, the number of unique aromatic protons varies based on substitution.

Wait, a di-substituted aromatic ring can be ortho, meta, or para. If it's para, then the two substituents are opposite each other, leading to two sets of equivalent aromatic protons. Because each substituent is across from the other, making the H's on the ring in two equivalent pairs. So in NMR, that would show up as two signals: one for each pair.

So in our case, since there are two aromatic signals, that suggests para substitution. Because if it were ortho, then the H's would be in three different environments, I think. Wait, let me think again. No, wait, if you have two substituents in para positions, the ring has two sets of equivalent H's. If the substituents are in ortho positions, then the H's would split into three different environments. Wait, maybe not. Let me think: for example, in para substitution, the ring has two substituents opposite each other. The H's adjacent to substituents would be in one environment, and the H's across would be in another. So two signals.

So, the two aromatic H signals suggest a para-substituted benzene ring.

Then, the NMR also has two vinyl H signals. One is a doublet, another a doublet of quartets. Vinyl H are typically from a double bond, like in an alkene or an aromatic ring, but since the aromatic Hs are already accounted for, perhaps the vinyl Hs are from an ester group. Wait, esters have an ethyl group maybe? Or another structure.

Ester groups can be part of an aromatic ester, like a benzyl ester. Let's think: when you have an ester group, say, an aryl ester, maybe the structure is something like O-CO-O-R, where R is an alkyl or aryl group. Or perhaps the ester is part of a substituent on the benzene ring.

Wait, another thought: the two vinyl H signals. So maybe the compound has an ethenyl group (CH2=CH-), but in a certain configuration. Or perhaps, it's part of a substituent. Wait, another possibility: if the substituent attached to the benzene ring includes a vinyl group, like an ester with a vinyl chain.

Alternatively, maybe the substituent is a group like -(CH2)n- where n is varying, but I'm not sure. Let's think about the ester structure. The ester functional group is R-O-CO-R'. So if R is an aryl group and R' is an alkyl, or vice versa.

In this case, maybe the substituent is an ester group attached to the benzene ring. For example, the benzene ring has two substituents, which could be an ester group and something else. Wait, but the question says it's a di-substituted compound. So two substituents on the benzene ring.

Wait, what if the substituent is an ester group itself. So the benzene ring has two ester groups attached? No, that would be di-ester, which is possible, but the NMR would show different patterns.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is an ester group, and the other substituent is something else. Let me think about the NMR.

The NMR shows two signals for vinyl H. That makes me think of two different types of vinyl protons. One is a doublet, and another is a doublet of quartets. So maybe there's a group with a double bond, perhaps a CH2-CH2-CO-O-R type structure. Or perhaps a CH2=CH-O-CO- group.

Wait, another possibility: the ester is part of a substituent that includes a vinyl group.

Wait, so let me imagine the structure. Let's say the benzene ring is para-substituted with two groups. One of them is an ester group, like O-CO-O-R, and another substituent is something else, perhaps a CH3 group or another ester.

Wait, but the NMR also shows two signals for -CH3 groups. So there are two different CH3 groups. So maybe the ester has two methyl groups attached. Or perhaps each substituent brings a CH3.

Wait, let me think. The NMR shows two CH3 signals. So two different methyl groups. One possibility is that each substituent has a methyl group. For example, if one substituent is an ester group with a methyl group, like O-CO-OCH2CH2CH3? No, that would be an ethyl ester, not a methyl. Wait, maybe one substituent is an OMe group (methoxy) and another is a carbonyl group? No, that's a ketone.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituents are -O-CO-CH2CH3 and another group that brings a CH3. Wait, but the ester group itself would have a R-O-CO-R' structure. For example, if R is an aryl group and R' is an ethyl group (CH2CH3), then the ester would have a CH2CH3 group. But then, the NMR would show signals for the CH2 and CH3 in that group.

Wait, the NMR shows no CH2 signals. So any CH2 groups must be equivalent or perhaps have been integrated into other signals. Or perhaps there are no CH2 groups in the structure.

Wait, the NMR shows two signals for vinyl H, two for aromatic H, and two for CH3. No CH2 signals. So the structure doesn't have any CH2 groups. So any alkyl chains must be either CH3 or maybe just single CH groups.

Hmm. So perhaps the substituent is an ester group where R' is a methyl group. For example, if the substituent is O-CO-OCH3, which is a methyl ester. But wait, no, that's a methyl ester, but the substituent would be O-CO-OCH3. So that would have a methyl group attached to the ester oxygen.

Wait, maybe the substituent is -COOCH3. So the benzene ring is para-substituted with two such groups? No, but that would be two ester groups, but perhaps each ester group has a methyl. Then, the NMR would have a singlet for the OCH3 groups, but wait, in that case, the OCH3 protons would be a singlet. But in the problem, the CH3 signals are two different ones, so perhaps they are not OCH3 but CH3 attached elsewhere.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a group that includes a vinyl group and a methyl group.

Wait, let's think of vinyl groups in esters. For example, an ester with a vinyl group, like CH2=CHCOOR. But I'm not sure if that's relevant here.

Wait, another angle. The NMR shows two CH3 groups. So perhaps the substituent includes two different methyl groups. For example, one substituent is a methyl group (CH3) attached to the ring, and another substituent is an
