Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again to make sure I understand what's being asked.

The problem says that we have a state |alpha> which is proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>. So, first, I think I need to normalize this state because it's only proportional, not necessarily a unit vector. The question then asks about the probability of measuring the particle in each eigenstate of a certain operator. The operator's matrix representation is given by Aij, where Aij is hbar/2 if i ≠ j and zero otherwise. I also need to find the average value of that operator.

Hmm, okay, let's break it down.

First, the state |alpha> is given as proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>. Since |up> and |down> are orthonormal eigenstates of S_z (the z-projection of spin), I can calculate the probabilities by normalizing this state and then taking the square of the amplitudes.

Step 1: Normalize the state |alpha>.

The state is |alpha> = a|up> + b|down>, where a = (1+i) and b = (2 - i). To normalize, I need to compute the norm: |a|^2 + |b|^2.

Calculating |a|^2: |1+i|^2 = (1)^2 + (1)^2 = 2.

Calculating |b|^2: |2 - i|^2 = (2)^2 + (-1)^2 = 4 + 1 =5.

So the total norm is 2 +5 =7. Therefore, the normalized state is |alpha> = [ (1+i)/sqrt(7) ] |up> + [ (2-i)/sqrt(7) ] |down>.

Now, the probabilities of measuring up and down are |(1+i)/sqrt(7)|^2 and |(2-i)/sqrt(7)|^2, respectively.

Calculating |1+i|^2 is 2, so 2/7 ≈ 0.2857. Similarly, |2-i|^2 is 5, so 5/7 ≈ 0.7143. Wait, wait, no. Wait, no. I think I made a mistake here. Wait, no, let me double-check. Wait, the norm is 7, so each coefficient is divided by sqrt(7). So the probability for |up> is |(1+i)|² /7, which is 2/7, approximately 0.2857, and for |down> it's |2-i|^2/7 =5/7≈0.7143. So the probabilities are about 0.2857 and 0.7143. Hmm, looking at the options, option C says 0.28 and 0.72, which is close. Option D has 0.61 and 0.29, which seems off. Option A has 0.64 and 0.36, no. So maybe the probabilities are 2/7 and 5/7, which are approximately 0.2857 and 0.714.

Wait, but wait, the question isn't just about the probabilities of measuring spin-up and spin-down, because the operator isn't S_z. The operator in question has a matrix where A_ij is hbar/2 when i≠j and 0 otherwise. Oh wait, that's a 2x2 matrix. Let me think about what kind of operator this is.

The matrix representation is:

[ 0   hbar/2 ]
[ hbar/2 0 ]

Wait, no, actually, for a 2x2 matrix, the diagonal entries are 0, and the off-diagonal are hbar/2. So the matrix is [[0, hbar/2],[hbar/2, 0]]. That looks familiar; that's the Pauli X matrix multiplied by hbar/2. Because the Pauli X matrix is [[0,1],[1,0]].

Wait, the Pauli matrices are for spin-1/2 systems. So the operator in question is (hbar/2) * sigma_x.

Wait, because the Pauli X matrix is sigma_x = [[0,1],[1,0]], so this operator A is (hbar/2) * sigma_x.

So the eigenstates of this operator are the eigenstates of sigma_x, which are the eigenstates of the spin-x operator. So the eigenstates are (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2) and (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2), with eigenvalues hbar/2 * (+1) and (-1), respectively.

So the operator's eigenstates are |+x> and |-x>, with eigenvalues hbar/2 and -hbar/2.

So to find the probability of measuring each eigenstate, I need to express |alpha> in terms of |+x> and |-x>, and then square the coefficients.

But wait, perhaps another approach is to compute the expectation value and the probabilities using the operator's properties. Alternatively, since the operator is proportional to sigma_x, we can compute the expectation value as (hbar/2) times the expectation value of sigma_x.

Wait, but let's go back. The question says: "the probability of measuring the particle in each of the eigenstates of the operator." So the operator has two eigenstates, each with their own eigenvalue. So the probabilities p_+ and p_- would be the square of the coefficients when expanding |alpha> in the eigenbasis of the operator.

So, first, let's find the expansion of |alpha> in terms of the eigenstates of A.

The eigenstates of A are:

|+x> =
