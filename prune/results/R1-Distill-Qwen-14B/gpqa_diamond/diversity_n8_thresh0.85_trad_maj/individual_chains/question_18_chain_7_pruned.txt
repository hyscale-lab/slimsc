Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here about stellar abundances, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question again to make sure I understand it.

So, there are two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. Their masses are 1.5 and 1.2 times that of the Sun, respectively. The question is about their photospheric composition, specifically the ratio of silicon atoms between them.

The problem gives us some abundance ratios. For Star_1, the [Si/Fe] ratio is 0.3 dex, and [Fe/H] is 0. For Star_2, the [Mg/Si] ratio is 0.3 dex, and [Mg/H] is 0. We're given the solar photosphere composition: 12 + log10(nFe/nH) is 7.5, and 12 + log10(nMg/nH) is 7. We need to find the ratio of silicon atoms in Star_1 to Star_2's photospheres.

Hmm, okay. Let me break this down. The notation here is about logarithmic abundances. The [X/Y] notation is the logarithm (base 10) of the ratio of the number of X to Y atoms, relative to the Sun. So [X/Y] = log10(n_X/n_Y) - log10(n_X/n_Y)_sun. Or wait, actually, [X/Y] is usually defined as log10(n_X/n_Y) - log10(n_X/n_Y)_sun, which is the same as log10(n_X/n_Y / (n_X/n_Y)_sun).

Wait, no, I think it's [X/Y] = log10(n_X/n_Y) - log10(n_X/n_Y)_sun, which is the same as log10( (n_X/n_Y) / (n_X/n_Y)_sun ). So [X/Y] is the logarithm of the ratio of X to Y abundance relative to solar.

The problem gives [Fe/H]_1 as 0, meaning Star_1 has the same Fe abundance as the Sun. Because [Fe/H] is log10(n_Fe/n_H) - log10(n_Fe/n_H)_sun. So if [Fe/H] is 0, n_Fe/n_H for Star_1 is equal to the solar value.

Same for Star_2: [Mg/H]_2 is 0, so n_Mg/n_H for Star_2 is equal to solar.

Wait, let me get the solar values straight. The Sun's photosphere has 12 + log10(nFe/nH) =7.5. So log10(nFe/nH) = 7.5 -12 = -4.5. So nFe/nH for the Sun is 10^(-4.5) ≈ 3.16e-5.

Similarly, for Mg: 12 + log10(nMg/nH) =7 → log10(nMg/nH) =7-12= -5 → nMg/nH is 10^-5 = 1e-5.

Wait, but wait, the numbers are given as 12 plus log10(nX/nH)
