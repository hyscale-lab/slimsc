Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question again.

So, the problem says I have a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring compound. Its FTIR shows ester groups, so that means there are ester functional groups present. Then, looking at the 1H NMR spectrum, there are six signals: two aromatic-H, two vinyl-H (one doublet and one doublet of quartets), and two -CH3 groups. No signals for -CH2 groups. I need to figure out the molecular formula from the options given.

First, let's break down the information. The compound is an aromatic ring with two substituents. Since it's a 6-membered aromatic ring, it's probably benzene or a substituted benzene derivative. The FTIR shows an ester group, which is O-C-O, so maybe an ester functional group attached to the ring.

Now, the NMR details. Let's list them:

1. Two aromatic H signals. Since it's a di-substituted benzene, the substitution pattern affects how many signals we see. For a para-substituted benzene, you usually get two signals: two H's in the para position relative to substituents. Wait, no, actually, in para substitution, the H's are equivalent, so maybe that's why there are two signals? Or maybe the substituents are in such a position that the aromatic H's split into two sets.

Wait, benzene has six H's. If it's di-substituted, depending on the substituents, the aromatic protons can split into different patterns. For example, in para substitution, the two substituents are opposite each other, so the remaining four H's would be equivalent in two sets of two each. That would give two signals. So that fits the two aromatic H signals. So the substituents are probably para to each other, but maybe they have different environments, leading to two signals.

2. Two vinyl H signals. Vinyl H's are from double bonds, like in an alkene. One is a doublet, another a doublet of quartets. Hmm. So perhaps there's an ester group attached to the ring, which would have a carbonyl group, but the ester typically has an oxygen and a carbonyl. Wait, the ester structure is R-O-CO-O-R, no, wait, that's not right. Esters are R-O-CO-R'. So maybe the substituents on the benzene are ester groups, but wait, if it's a di-substitution, perhaps one substituent is an ester, and the other is something else? Or maybe both substituents are ester groups.

Wait, the question says the compound is di-substituted, so two substituents on the ring. One substituent is an ester group. Wait, but the IR shows the presence of an ester, so maybe the substituent is an ester group, like O-CO-O-R or something. Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a vinyl group, but no, the vinyl H's are in the NMR, so maybe the substituent is an ester with a vinyl group attached.

Wait, perhaps the substituents are ester groups with some vinyl substituents. Let me think. Let's consider each substituent.

Wait, another approach: the molecular formula options are C11H12O2, C11H14O2, C12H12O2, C12H14O2.

The degrees of unsaturation can help. Degree of unsaturation is (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. Assuming no X or N, it's (2C +2 - H)/2.

Take option D: C11H12O2. So 2*11 +2 =24; 24 -12=12; 12/2=6. So 6 degrees: likely a benzene ring (3) and a double bond (1), and maybe an ester (which has a carbonyl, another double bond). Alternatively, benzene (3) and an ester (adds one double bond).
