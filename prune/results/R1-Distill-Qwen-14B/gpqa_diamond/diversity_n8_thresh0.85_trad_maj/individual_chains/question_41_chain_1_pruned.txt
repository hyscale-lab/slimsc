Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I need to figure it out. Let me read it carefully.

The question is about the speed of light in a moving glass medium. The setup is that a light beam is propagating through a glass with index of refraction n. The glass itself is moving at a constant velocity v in the same direction as the beam, and towards the observer in the laboratory. The question is asking what the speed of the light in the glass is, relative to the observer in the lab. They also mention that the speed of light in a vacuum is c=1.

Hmm. I remember from my studies that the speed of light in a medium depends on the medium's refractive index. The general formula is v = c/n, where c is the speed of light in a vacuum. But wait, that's when the medium is stationary relative to the observer. What happens when the medium itself is moving?

So, the glass is moving at velocity v in the same direction as the light beam, which is toward the observer. So the glass is moving towards the observer, and the light beam is moving in the same direction as the glass's motion.

I think this involves some sort of relative velocity consideration. Oh right, when objects are moving relative to each other, velocities add in a certain way. But wait, when dealing with light, things get tricky because of relativity. However, the question says the glass is moving at a constant velocity, which suggests we are in the realm of classical mechanics, not special relativity. Because in special relativity, velocities don't just add linearly.

Wait, but when the medium is moving, like water or glass, how does that affect the observed speed of light? Because I remember that in classical physics, the speed of light in a medium is c/n, and if the medium is moving, you add the medium's velocity to the light's velocity in that medium. But I'm not entirely sure.

Alternatively, I've heard of the concept of the "ether," but that's outdated. However, if we ignore relativity and think classically, perhaps the speed of the light relative to the lab frame would just be the speed of the light in the medium plus the medium's velocity. But wait, the light in the medium moves slower than c. So if the medium is moving, do you just add its velocity to the light's speed in the medium?

Wait, let me think again. The speed of light in the medium (glass) is v_medium = c/n = 1/n, since c is 1 here. The glass is moving at velocity v in the same direction as the light. So, from the lab
