Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through step by step. Let me read the question again to make sure I get all the details.

So the question is about finding the uncertainty in the P_z operator, ΔP_z, when the system is in a specific eigenstate of P_x with eigenvalue -ħ. The state is given as a column vector with elements (-1/2, 1/√2, -1/2). The matrices for P_x, P_y, and P_z are provided.

Hmm, I remember that the uncertainty in an observable is calculated using the formula ΔA = sqrt(⟨A²⟩ - ⟨A⟩²). So I need to find the expectation values of P_z and (P_z)^2 in the given state.

First, let me write down the given state vector. It's a column vector:
|ψ⟩ = [ -1/2, 1/√2, -1/2 ]^T.

Wait, actually, the problem says "the explicit form is the column vector having elements (-1/2, 1/√2, -1/2)". So the state is a 3-component vector. That makes sense because the matrices are 3x3.

Next, I need to compute the expectation value ⟨P_z⟩. The expectation value is given by ψ† P_z ψ. So I'll have to multiply the vector by P_z matrix and then take the inner product.

Wait, the P_z matrix is given as:
Row 1: (ħ, 0, 0)
Row 2: (0, 0, 0)
Row 3: (0, 0, -ħ)

So the matrix looks like:
[ [ħ, 0, 0],
  [0, 0, 0],
  [0, 0, -ħ] ]

Let me compute P_z |ψ⟩ first. Since P_z is diagonal, this should be straightforward. Each component will just be multiplied by the corresponding diagonal element.

So:

First component: (ħ) * (-1/2) = -ħ/2
Second component: 0 * (1/√2) = 0
Third component: (-ħ) * (-1/2) = ħ/2

So P_z |ψ⟩ is the vector [ -ħ/2, 0, ħ/2 ]^T.

Now, the expectation value ⟨
