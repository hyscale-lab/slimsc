Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about particle physics, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question says.

The problem is about the decay of a pion into a muon and a neutrino. The reaction is π+ → μ+ + ν. The pion is at rest, which probably simplifies some calculations. The rest masses are given: the pion is 139.6 MeV, and the muon is 105.7 MeV. I'm supposed to find the kinetic energies of the product particles, the muon and the neutrino. The options are A to D, each with two values presumably for the muon and neutrino KE.

Hmm, okay. So, to approach this, I remember that in particle decays, energy and momentum must be conserved. Since the pion is at rest, the total initial momentum is zero. So the products must have equal and opposite momenta. But wait, neutrinos are tricky because they have such tiny (but non-zero) mass. Oh, wait, in the case of neutrinos, for high-energy physics, they are often treated as massless, but I should check if that's the case here.

The rest mass of the neutrino (ν) is negligible compared to the other particles, right? Because neutrinos are super light, almost massless. So perhaps we can approximate their mass as zero. That would make things easier.

So, let me jot down the given data:
- Mass of π+: m_π = 139.6 MeV/c²
- Mass of μ+: m_μ = 105.7 MeV/c²
- Mass of ν ≈ 0 (if treated as massless)

The initial momentum is zero because the pion is stationary. So the total momentum after decay must also be zero. That means the momenta of the muon and the neutrino must be equal in magnitude and opposite in direction.

So, p_μ = -p_ν. But since the neutrino is treated as massless, its energy comes only from its momentum (E_ν = |p_ν|c). The muon has both kinetic energy and rest mass energy, so its energy E_μ = K_μ + m_μ c².

Wait, but wait, considering units, in particle physics, they often use units where c=1, so energies and masses are in MeV, and momentum in MeV/c. So, perhaps I'll proceed with that assumption.

Let me model the conservation laws.

Energy conservation: E_initial = E_μ + E_ν
E_initial is the rest energy of the pion: E_π = m_π c² = 139.6 MeV (since c=1, E=m in these units).

So, 139.6 = E_μ + E_ν.

Momentum conservation: since the pion is at rest, the total momentum is zero. So p_μ + p_ν = 0 → p_ν = -p_μ.

But for the neutrino, if it's massless, E_ν = |p_ν| c, which is |p_μ| (since p_ν = -p_μ, so |p_ν|=|p_μ|). So E_ν = |p_μ|.

For the muon, E_μ² = (p_μ c)^2 + (m_μ c²)^2. But since we're using c=1 units, E_μ² = p_μ² + m_μ^2.

So, E_μ = sqrt(p_μ² + m_μ²).

Wait, but in our case, since p_ν = -p_μ, and E_ν = |p_μ|, we can substitute.

So, substituting E_ν into the energy equation:

139.6 = sqrt(p_μ² + m_μ²) + |p_μ|.

Let me let x = |p_μ|, which is the magnitude of the muon's momentum. Then:

139.6 = sqrt( x² + (105.7)^2 ) + x.

Hmm
