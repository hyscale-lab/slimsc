Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the correct answer. Let me start by carefully reading the question and the given data.

The problem says that Compound X reacts with red phosphorus and HI. I remember that red phosphorus and HI are typically used in the HI (hydroiodic acid) reaction, which is a type of acid-catalyzed cleavage. This reaction usually breaks double bonds, especially in alkenes, by adding iodine across them. So I think this reaction is probably a hydration or an acid-catalyzed addition, maybe leading to diiodide formation, but more likely, it's a cleavage of a triple bond or an alkene with some specific conditions.

Now, looking at the spectral data for Compound X. The IR and NMR are provided. Let's analyze them step by step.

Starting with the IR data:
- 3400â€“2500 cm-1: This broad range suggests the presence of either an -OH group (alcohol or carboxylic acid) or an amine. Since the next peak is at 1720 cm-1, which is a strong carbonyl (C=O) stretch. A carboxylic acid or an ester would have this peak. But wait, if it's a carboxylic acid, the O-H stretch would be very strong and broad around 2500-3300. Alternatively, maybe an ester or ketone? Wait, but the 3400-2500 is a broad region, which could be an OH group, perhaps from a carboxylic acid. So maybe Compound X is a benzoic acid derivative.

Looking further: 1610 cm-1 might be an aromatic ring (C=C stretching). The 1450 cm-1 could be C-O stretching, maybe in an ester or a carboxylic acid. Hmm, wait, but if it's a carboxylic acid, the 1720 would be the C=O. So if it's a benzoic acid derivative, then the IR makes sense.

Now looking at the 1H NMR data:

10.5 ppm (bs, 1H): A broad singlet around 10.5 ppm is characteristic of an aldehyde proton (-CHO), but wait, if it's a carboxylic acid, the -OH would be around 10-12, but in the NMR, the -OH of a carboxylic acid is usually a broad peak. Alternatively, maybe it's an aldehyde, but 10.5 is a bit low for that. Wait, or could it be an acidic proton like in a phenol or a carboxylic acid.

Wait, the integration is 1H, so maybe it's a phenolic OH. But phenol protons are usually around 5 ppm or so. Hmm. Wait, maybe it's the -COOH proton. Carboxylic acid protons are usually broad and around 10-12 ppm. So 10.5 would fit that. So maybe there is a carboxylic acid group.

Next, 8.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.2 ppm (d, 2H). These are typical of a substituted benzene ring with two substituents in para positions. For example, if we have a benzene ring with two substituents that are para to each other, like in para-xylene or similar structures. The splitting into doublets suggests that each H is adjacent to one substituent. Wait, in para substitution, the two H's on each substituent would be equivalent. So for example, in a substituted benzene where each substituent is at the para position, the aromatic protons would split into two doublets. Like in 4-substituted benzoic acids or similar.

Then, 2.9 ppm (m, 1H). This is a multiplet integrating to one H. That could be a methylene group next to an oxygen, like in a CH2-O structure, or perhaps a CH group adjacent to something electronegative. Alternatively, maybe it's a CH in a branched chain, like in an isobutyl group.

1.7 ppm (m, 2H): Multiplet with two H. Maybe this is part of a CH2 group adjacent to a CH or maybe part of a longer chain, like a butyl group.

1.4 ppm (d, 3H): A doublet integrating three H. This suggests a CH3 group attached to a CH. For example, in an isopropyl group, the CH3 would be split by the adjacent CH. Alternatively, it could be a tertiary butyl group or similar.

0.9 ppm (t, 3H): A triplet integrating three H. This is a typical terminal CH3 group, as in an ethyl or propyl chain. So maybe a longer chain like a butyl group.

Putting this together: The NMR suggests a benzene ring with substituents in the para positions. One substituent is a carboxylic acid group. The other substituent is a more complex group.

Wait, but let me think again. The IR shows a strong carbonyl at 1720 cm-1, which could be a carboxylic acid. So the -COOH is present. The NMR peak at 10.5 ppm is probably the -OH of the carboxylic acid.

Looking at the substituents on the benzene ring: The 8.0 ppm and 7.2 ppm doublets suggest two equivalent substituents at the para positions. So each substituent is in the para position.

So, the benzene ring has a -COOH group and another group in the para position. The other group's NMR signals are the rest.

Looking at the substituent attached to the benzene:

The 2.9 ppm (m, 1H) is a CH group. The 1.7 (m, 2H) is adjacent to that, perhaps a CH2. The 1.4 (d, 3H) is a CH3 attached to a CH, and the 0.9 (t, 3H) is a CH2CH2CH3.

Wait, perhaps this substituent is a butyl group. Let me draw it.

The group attached to the benzene is maybe a CH2CH(CH2CH2CH3) or something like that? Wait, let's see.

Let me think about the substituent's structure. The NMR shows:

- 2.9 ppm (m, 1H): perhaps a CH group next to another CH2.

- 1.7 ppm (m, 2H): perhaps two Hs on a CH2 adjacent to the CH.

- 1.4 ppm (d, 3H): this is a CH3 attached to a CH. Since it's a doublet, the CH must be adjacent to another group. So perhaps the structure is CH(CH3)(CH2CH2CH3).

Wait, that might not fit. Let me think in terms of possible branching.

Suppose the substituent is a -CH2-C(CH3)(CH2CH2CH3) group. Wait, that would be a more complex structure. Alternatively, perhaps it's a secondary or tertiary butyl group.

Wait, another way: the substituent is a -CH2-CH(CH2CH2CH3)- group attached to the benzene.

Wait, or perhaps it's a -CH(CH2CH2CH3)CH2- group. Hmm, perhaps more accurately, this substituent is a butyl group with branching, like a isobutyl group.

Wait, let me think about the substituent as a sec-butyl group. A sec-butyl group is -CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-. Wait, no, the structure is -CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-, but that would be a pentyl group. Hmm, maybe not.

Wait, let's think about the substituent as a butyl group. The 0.9 ppm triplet (3H) suggests a terminal CH3. So perhaps the substituent is an ethyl group attached to a CH2, which is attached to another CH, which is attached to a CH3. Wait, that's a bit confusing.

Alternative approach: let me try to draw the structure based on the NMR.

The substituent on the benzene ring is a group R, which has the following Hs:

- 2.9 ppm (m, 1H): probably a CH group.

- 1.7 ppm (m, 2H): perhaps a CH2 group.

- 1.4 ppm (d, 3H): a CH3 attached to a CH.

- 0.9 ppm (t, 3H): a CH3 at the end of a chain.

So, putting it together: R is a chain that branches. Let me think of a structure where CH3 is attached to a CH, which is attached to a CH2, which is attached to a CH3 (terminal).

Wait, perhaps R is -(CH2)CH(CH3)CH2CH2CH3? No, that's a pentyl group, but the NMR doesn't show enough Hs.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a secondary butyl group. Let me think of sec-butyl group: the structure is CH2CH(CH2CH3)2. Wait, no, that's 2-methylpropyl group
