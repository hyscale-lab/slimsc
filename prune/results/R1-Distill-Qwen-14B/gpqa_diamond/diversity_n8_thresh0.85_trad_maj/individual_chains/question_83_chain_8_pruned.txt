Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure out how to solve it. Let's see what the question says.

The problem is about titrating a diluted acetic acid solution with NaOH. I remember that acetic acid is a weak acid, so it doesn't completely dissociate in water. The question gives me the initial volume and concentration of acetic acid, then says it's diluted with water. After that, it's titrated with 0.1 M NaOH. I need to find the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point. The options are given as A, B, C, D.

First, I think I should outline what each part involves. There are two main parts: the pH during the titration before the equivalence point (25% titration) and the pH at the equivalence point.

Let me start by calculating the concentration of the diluted acetic acid solution. The initial volume is 20.00 cm³ (which is 0.020 liters) of 0.05 M acetic acid. When we dilute it with 20 cm³ of water, the total volume becomes 40 cm³ (0.040 liters). The dilution formula is M1V1 = M2V2.

So M2 = M1 * V1 / V2. Plugging in the numbers: 0.05 M * 20 cm³ / 40 cm³ = 0.025 M. So the diluted acetic acid is 0.025 M.

Next, the titration with NaOH. The NaOH concentration is 0.1 M. We need to find the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point.

Let's tackle the equivalence point first because I'm more familiar with that. At equivalence, all the acetic acid has reacted with NaOH. The reaction is CH3COOH + NaOH → CH3COONa + H2O. So, the acetate ion (CH3COO^-) is the conjugate base of acetic acid.

To find the equivalence point, I'll calculate the moles of acetic acid initially and see how much NaOH is needed to neutralize it.

Moles of acetic acid: initial concentration * volume = 0.05 M * 0.020 L = 0.001 moles.

Since the reaction is 1:1, moles of NaOH needed at equivalence are also 0.001 moles.

The volume of NaOH needed would be moles / concentration = 0.001 / 0.1 = 0.01 L = 10 cm³.

Wait, but in the diluted solution, the volume is 40 cm³. So when adding 10 cm³ of NaOH, the total volume would be 50 cm³.

But wait, perhaps I don't need the volume of NaOH for the equivalence point calculation. Let me think. At equivalence, the solution is a buffer of sodium acetate. The solution will consist of the sodium acetate dissolved in water, which will hydrolyze to produce a basic solution.

The sodium acetate dissociates completely into Na+ and CH3COO^- ions. The acetate ion will react with water:

CH3COO^- + H2O ↔ CH3COOH + OH^-

The Kb for acetate can be found from Kw / Ka. Ka is given as 1.85e-5, so Kb = 1e-14 / 1.85e-5 ≈ 5.405e-10.

Wait, no, wait. Let me calculate that again. 1e-14 divided by 1.85e-5:

1e-14 / 1.85e-5 = (1 / 1.85) * 1e-9 ≈ 0.5405e-9 = 5.405e-10. Yes, correct.

So, the Kb is 5.405e-10. Since Kb is small, the hydrolysis won't produce a lot of OH- ions, but since it's a weak base, we can approximate.

The concentration of acetate ions at equivalence point is the moles divided by the total solution volume. Moles of acetate are same as moles of acetic acid initially, which is 0.001 moles. Total volume is 40 cm³ (diluted solution) + 10 cm³ NaOH = 50 cm³ (0.050 L). So [CH3COO^-] = 0.001 / 0.050 = 0.02 M.

Wait, no. Wait, wait. At equivalence point, all the acetic acid is converted to acetate. So the moles of acetate are 0.001, yes. But when you add 10 cm³ of NaOH (0.01 L) to the 40 cm³ diluted solution, the total volume is 50 cm³ (0.05 L). So [CH3COO^-] is 0.001 / 0.05 = 0.02 M.

So Kb is 5.405e-10. Let's set up the expression:

Kb = [CH3COOH][OH^-] / [CH3COO^-]

Assuming x is the [OH^-] produced:

Kb = x^2 / (0.02 - x) ≈ x^2 / 0.02, because x will be very small.

So x^2 = Kb * 0.02 = 5.405e-10 * 0.02 = 1.081e-11.

x = sqrt(1.081e-11) ≈ 1.04e-5 M.

So [OH^-] is about 1.04e-5 M. Then pOH is -log(1.04e-5) ≈ 4.98. So pH would be 14 - 4.98 ≈ 9.02.

Wait, but none of the options have pH near 9. So what did I do wrong?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating Kb. Let me double-check.

Ka for acetic acid is 1.85e-5. So Kb = Kw / Ka = 1e-14 / 1.85e-5 = (1e-14) / (1.85e-5) = (1 / 1.85) * 1e-9.

1 / 1.85 is approximately 0.5405, so 0.5405e-9 = 5.405e-10. So that's correct.

Wait, maybe I messed up the calculation of [CH3COO^-]. Let me check again. Moles of acetate are 0.001, total volume is 50 cm³ (0.05 L). So 0.001 / 0.05 = 0.02 M. Correct.

Wait, but if the solution is at equivalence with acetate, perhaps I should use the formula for a salt of a weak acid and strong
