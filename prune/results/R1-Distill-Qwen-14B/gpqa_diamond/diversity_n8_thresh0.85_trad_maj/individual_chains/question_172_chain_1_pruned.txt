Alright, so I've got this question about stars and their photospheres. Hmm, okay, let me think through this.

The question says that in star_1, the iron atoms are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to star_2. Oh wait, and the energy difference between the levels is given. The stars are in LTE, which means Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium. So I should probably use the Boltzmann distribution here.

Boltzmann distribution relates the population of different energy levels in a system. The formula I remember is the ratio of the populations of two energy states. The formula is something like n2/n1 = exp( -(E2-E1)/(k*T) ), where E2 and E1 are the energies, k is Boltzmann's constant, and T is the temperature.

In this problem, for star_1, the population of the excited state is twice that of star_2. Let me denote the excited state as state 2 and the lower state as state 1. So for star_1, n2_1 / n1_1 = 2. For star_2, n2_2 / n1_2 = let's see, but wait, the problem says that star_1's iron atoms are twice as excited, which would mean n2 for star_1 is twice that of star_2? Or wait, no. The question says iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited as in star_2. So maybe the ratio for star_1 is higher.

Wait, no, the problem says "iron atoms in the photosphere of star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level when compared to the iron atoms in star_2." So I think this means that the population of the excited state in star_1's photosphere is twice that in star_2's. So for each star, the ratio is:

n2_1 / n1_1 = 2 (since star_1 has twice as many excited atoms)
n2_2 / n1_2 = ?

Wait, no. Wait, actually, the question says that in star_1, the number of excited atoms is twice as much as in star_2. So, n2_1 = 2 * n2_2? Or wait, no, n2_1 over n1_1 is 2. Because for each star, the ratio of the excited to ground state is 2. Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused.

Wait, no. Let me think again. The energy difference is
