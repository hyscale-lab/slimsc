Okay, so I've got this physics problem in front of me, and I'm a bit nervous because it's about relativity. I remember that relativity involves some tricky formulas, especially when dealing with speeds close to the speed of light and energies. Let me try to break this down step by step.

The question says we have two astronauts with masses 2m and 3m. They're moving at relativistic speeds: 0.6c and 0.5c respectively, both in the positive x-direction. The problem is asking for two things: the relative speed between them and the total energy of the system.

Hmm. I remember that when dealing with relative speeds in relativity, we can't just subtract the velocities like we do in classical mechanics. Oh right, because that would give a speed greater than c, which isn't possible according to Einstein's theory. So I need to use the relativistic velocity addition formula.

Wait, what's the formula again? Oh yeah, if object A is moving at u and object B is moving at v, both as seen from a stationary frame, then the speed of A relative to B is (u - v)/(1 - (uv/c²)). Or is it the other way around? No, wait, the formula is (u - v) divided by (1 - (uv/c²)), right. Because when you change frames, you have to account for the time dilation and length contraction effects.

So in this case, both are moving in the same direction. Let's say the first astronaut (mass 2m) is moving at 0.6c, and the second (3m) is at 0.5c. So from the perspective of the second astronaut, what's the speed of the first?

Wait, no. Wait, actually, the question is asking for the relative speed of the two astronauts. So if astronaut A is moving at 0.6c and astronaut B at 0.5c, both in the same direction, then from B's frame, A is moving at (0.6c - 0.5c)/(1 - (0.6c * 0.5c)/(c²)).

Let me compute that. Numerator: 0.1c. Denominator: 1 - (0.3c²)/(c²) = 1 - 0.3 = 0.7. So 0.1c / 0.7 ≈ 0.1428c. So about 0.14c. That would match one of the options, like options C or D, which have 0.14c.

But wait, I need to make sure I didn't mix up the order. Because the formula depends on which frame you're considering. Let me think: if I'm in B's frame, then the speed of A is (u' - v')/(1 - (u'v')/c²). Wait, no. Let me clarify. The relativistic velocity addition formula is when you have a frame S where object 1 is moving at u and object 2 is moving at v, then the speed of object 1 relative to object 2 (u') is (u - v)/(1 - (u v)/(c²)).

Wait, but in this case, both are moving in the same direction. So if we're looking for the speed of astronaut A as seen from astronaut B, since B is moving at 0.5c, then A is moving at 0.6c - 0.5c? No, that's not correct because that's just the classical subtraction, which would be 0.1c, but that's not the relativistic way.

So the formula is (0.6c - 0.5c) / (1 - (0.6c * 0.5c)/(c²)). Let me compute the denominator: 0.6 * 0.5 is 0.3, so 0.3/(c²) times c² is 0.3, so denominator is 1 - 0.3 = 0.7. So numerator is 0.1c. So 0.1c / 0.7 is approximately 0.1428c, which is about 0.14c. So that would be the relative speed between them, which matches options C and D.

Now, the second part is the total energy of the system. I remember that the total energy of a relativistic object is given by gamma times m c squared. Gamma is 1 / sqrt(1 - (v²/c²)).

So for each astronaut, we calculate their individual energies and sum them.

First astronaut: mass 2m, speed 0.6c.

Gamma for him: 1/sqrt(1 - (0.6)^2) = 1/sqrt(1 - 0.36) = 1/sqrt(0.64) = 1/0.8 = 1.25.

So his energy is gamma * 2m c² = 1.25 * 2m c² = 2.5 m c².

Second astronaut: mass 3m, speed 0.5c.

Gamma for him: 1/sqrt(1 - (0.5)^2) = 1/sqrt(1 - 0.25) = 1/sqrt(0.75) ≈ 1.1547.

So his energy is 1.1547 * 3m c² ≈ 3.464 m c².

Adding them together: 2.5 + 3.464 = 5.964 m c². So approximately 5.96 m c². That would correspond to option C, which has E=5.96 mc².

Wait, but let me check the exact calculation for the second gamma.

0.5 squared is 0.25. 1-0.25=0.75. Square root of 0.75 is sqrt(3/4) = (√3)/2 ≈0.8660. So 1/0.8660 ≈1.1547, so yes, about 1.1547.

So 3m *1.1547 *c²=3*1.1547=3.4641 m c².

So sum is 2.5 +3.4641=5.9641 m c². Which is approximately 5.96 mc², as I thought.

Looking at the options:

Option C: v_rel =0.14c, E=5.96 mc^2.

Option D: v_rel=0.14c, E=5mc^2.

So E would be 5.96, so option C.

Another thing to double-check: sometimes people might forget to consider the rest mass energy. Oh wait, each astronaut's energy is their relativistic gamma multiplied by their rest energy (m c^2). So yes, that's correctly done.

So the relative speed is approximately 0.14c, and the energy is approximately 5.96 mc². So the correct option is C.


To solve the problem, we analyze the relativistic relative speed and total energy of the system.

### Step 1: Relative Speed
The relativistic velocity addition formula is used to calculate the relative speed of the two astronauts. If astronaut A is moving at \( u = 0.6c \) and astronaut B at \( v = 0.5c \), the relative speed of A as seen from B is:

\[
v_{\text{rel}} = \frac{u - v}{1 - \frac{uv}{c^2}}
\]

Substituting the values:
\[
v_{\text{rel}} = \frac{0.6c - 0.5c}{1 - \frac{(0.6c)(0.5c)}{c^2}} = \frac{0.1c}{1 - 0.3} = \frac{0.1c}{0.7} \approx 0.1428c \approx 0.14c
\]

Thus, the relative speed is approximately \( 0.14c \).

### Step 2: Total Energy of the System
The total energy of a relativistic object is given by \( E = \gamma m c^2 \), where \( \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}}} \).

#### For astronaut A (mass \( 2m \), speed \( 0.6c \)):
\[
\gamma_A = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - (0.6)^2}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - 0.36}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.64}} = \frac{1}{0.8} = 1.25
\]
\[
E_A = \gamma_A \cdot 2m c^2 = 1.25 \cdot 2m c^2 = 2.5m c^2
\]

#### For astronaut B (mass \( 3m \), speed \( 0.5c \)):
\[
\gamma_B = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - (0.5)^2}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - 0.25}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.75}} \approx 1.1547
\]
\[
E_B = \gamma_B \cdot 3m c^2 = 1.1547 \cdot 3m c^2 \approx 3.464m c^2
\]

#### Total Energy:
\[
E_{\text{total}} = E_A + E_B = 2.5m c^2 + 3.464m c^2 \approx 5.964m c^2 \approx 5.96m c^2
\]

### Final Answer
The relative speed is \( 0.14c \), and the total energy of the system is \( 5.96m c^2 \). Comparing with the options, the correct choice is:

**C) \( v_{\text{rel}} = 0.14c \), \( E = 5.96m c^2 \)**.
