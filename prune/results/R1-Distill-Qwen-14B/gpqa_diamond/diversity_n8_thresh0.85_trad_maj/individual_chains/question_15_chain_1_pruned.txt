Okay, so I've got this question about exoplanets and the probability of them transiting their host stars. Hmm, I remember that the transit method is used to detect planets when they pass in front of their star from our point of view, causing a dip in brightness. But I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact factors that influence the probability of a transit happening.

The question states that there are two planets, Planet_1 and Planet_2. Both have the same mass, which was detected via the RV method. Their orbital periods are different: Planet_1's period is three times shorter than Planet_2's. So Planet_1 is closer in, right? Because a shorter orbital period usually means a closer orbit, thanks to Kepler's third law.

The host stars have the same radii but different masses. The star with Planet_1 has twice the mass of Planet_2's star. Oh wait, but the host's radius is the same. So even though the more massive star is bigger in mass, it's similar in size to the other. That's interesting because a star's radius affects the transit probability.

I remember that the probability of a planet transiting its star is given by a formula. Let me think. I think the transit probability depends on the size of the planet relative to the star and the orbital distance. The formula is P = (R_planet / R_star) * (1 / (a * sqrt(1 - e²))) ), assuming a circular orbit (e=0). So in this case, since both orbits are circular, the eccentricity term doesn't matter. So the probability simplifies to (R_p / R_s) * (1/a), but wait, no, I think I might be mixing terms.

Wait, maybe I should recall the correct formula. The transit probability is actually given by P ≈ (R_p / R_* )² * (1 / (a * (1 - e^2)))^(1/2) or something like that. No, wait, more accurately, I think the geometric probability is P = (R_p / R_s)^2 * (a / ( ... )) Wait, perhaps I'm confusing it with something else. Let me think again.

I think the geometric probability of a transit is approximately R_s / a, where R_s is the star's radius and a is the semi-major axis (since for a circular orbit, a is the orbital radius). But no, wait, I think more precisely, the probability is proportional to (R_p + R_s)^2 / (a^2), but that's not quite right. Alternatively, the probability is
