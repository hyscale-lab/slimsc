Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question says.

Alright, the problem starts with Compound A. It has a proton NMR with two signals. One is a triplet at 0.9 ppm integrating for 6H, and the other is a quartet at 1.3 ppm integrating for 4H. Hmm, NMR can tell me a lot about the structure. So, 6H as a triplet at low ppm suggests maybe two equivalent methyl groups. Triplets usually come from coupling with two neighboring protons each. Like, if a CH2 is next to another CH2, each end would be a triplet.

Wait, so the triplet (6H) could be two CH3 groups attached to a CH2 that's next to another CH2. Because each CH3 is attached to a CH2 which is next to another CH2. So the splitting would be triplet for each CH3, but since they're all equivalent, it's a single triplet for all 6H. So maybe like (CH2CH3)2 something.

The quartet at 1.3 ppm is 4H. Quartet implies each proton is next to three equivalent protons. So a CH2 group next to a CH2 group with two CH3 groups on each end? Wait, no, the quartet for 4H—so maybe two sets of two protons each, each coupled to two others. Like, a CH2CH2 structure where each CH2 is next to another CH2. Wait, no—if each CH2 is next to another CH2, each would be a quartet. Because each proton is coupled with two on each adjacent group. So for example, if you have CH2-CH2, each would split into a quartet. So 4H in total would fit that.

Putting it together, maybe the structure is something like (CH2CH3)2CHCH2CH2CH3? Wait, no, that doesn't quite add up. Alternatively, maybe it's two ethyl groups attached to a central CH2. Wait, but that would mean the central CH2 is between two ethyl groups. So the structure would be CH2CH3-O-CH2CH3? No, that's diethyl ether, but the NMR would be different. Alternatively, maybe it's CH(CH2CH3)2. But then the CH would split into a triplet, but wait, the 6H would be from two CH3 groups.

Wait, maybe it's a diethyl group. Wait, the NMR shows a triplet and quartet. Oh, wait, another possibility: perhaps it's a cyclopropane derivative? No, maybe that's overcomplicating. Alternatively, think of a structure where a central CH2 is connected to two CH2CH3 groups and another CH2. Hmm.

Wait, another thought: think of a structure where there's a central CH2 connected to two ethyl groups. So like CH2CH2(C H2CH3)2. No, that would be (CH2CH3)2CHCH2CH3? Wait, maybe it's a four-carbon chain with ethyl groups on the ends. Or maybe it's a 2-pentane derivative. Alternatively, maybe it's a 2-methylpropane with some substituents.

Wait, perhaps it's 2,2-dimethylbutane or something like that. Let me think: the triplet at 0.9 ppm (6H) could be two methyl groups attached to a CH2. The quartet at 1.3 (4H) could be the CH2 adjacent to those methyl groups. So maybe the structure is (CH3)2CHCH2CH2CH3? Wait, no, that's pentane with a branch. Wait, no, let's count the protons.

If it's (CH3)2CHCH2CH2CH3, then the structure is 3-methylpentane. But the NMR would show different signals. The (CH3)2CH group would be a triplet, and the adjacent CH2 would be a quartet. But in that case, the NMR would have more signals. Because the end CH2CH3 is a triplet as well.

Wait, perhaps the structure is neopentane, 2,2-dimethylpropane. But that's a very branched structure, and the NMR would have different signals. Alternatively, maybe it's diethyl something. Wait, maybe it's a cyclopropane ring? No, perhaps not.

Wait, another approach: the triplet at 0.9 ppm for 6H suggests two equivalent CH3 groups, each next to a CH2. So each CH3 is attached to a CH2. And the quartet at 1.3 ppm for 4H suggests a CH2 adjacent to another CH2.

Wait, could the structure be (CH2CH3)2CHCH2? No, that would be four carbons. Alternatively, maybe it's CH2CH2 connected to two CH2CH3 groups, but that doesn't make much sense.

Wait, another thought: perhaps it's a diethyl ether, but I'm not sure. In diethyl ether (CH2CH3)2O, the CH2CH3 groups would show up as a quartet for the CH2 next to O, and a triplet for the CH3. But in the problem, the triplet is for 6H, which would require two CH3 groups each contributing 3H. So that fits, but in diethyl ether, the CH2 would be split into a quartet. Wait, but the quartet in the question is for 4H, which would be two CH2 groups each with two H. So yeah, diethyl ether's structure is OCH2CH3, so the CH2 would be a quartet, and the CH3 would be a triplet. But wait, the diethyl ether would have two CH2CH3 groups, so each CH2 would be a quartet (coupled with the adjacent OCH2), and the CH3 would be a triplet (coupled with the CH2). But the integral would be 6H for CH3 and 4H for CH2. Hmm, that matches the given data. So maybe Compound A is diethyl ether?

Wait, but diethyl ether would have two CH2 groups each with two H. So the quartet is from the CH2 next to O. Each CH2 would be a quartet because the adjacent OCH2 has two H, but wait, no. Diethyl ether's structure is CH2CH3-O-CH2CH3. So each CH2 adjacent to O is a quartet because each H is next to two H on the adjacent CH2. So each CH2 in the ethoxy group is a quartet. So the NMR would show a quartet for the CH2 (4H in total), and a triplet for the CH3 (6H in total). Oh, that matches the given data!

But wait, compound A undergoes monobromination. Diethyl ether is (CH2CH3)2O. So where would it brominate? The diethyl ether is not very reactive towards bromination. Wait, perhaps it's a different compound. Because alkanes typically undergo bromination via radical substitution, but under what conditions? Alternatively, maybe compound A is an alkane.

Wait, if A is an alkane, then bromination would likely be via free radical substitution. But the structure of A from the NMR needs to be a symmetrical molecule because the NMR shows only two signals. So perhaps it's 2,2-dimethylpropane (neopentane), but that's 2,2-dimethylpropane, which is 2-methylpropane, which is actually 2-methylpropane is neopentane. Wait, wait, neopentane is 2,2-dimethylpropane. Its NMR would have how many signals? Let's think: the central carbon is connected to four CH3 groups. So each CH3 is equivalent, so the NMR would have a singlet for 12H. But in our case, the NMR has 6H and 4H, so that's not matching.

Hmm, maybe I was wrong about the initial structure. Let me think again. The triplet for 6H and quartet for 4H. Another possibility: perhaps it's a cyclohexane derivative, but that seems unlikely. Or maybe the structure is something like (CH2CH3)2CHCH2CH3? Let's see the structure: that would be 3-methylpentane. Wait, in that structure, the CH(CH2CH3) group would have adjacent CH2 groups. Let me think about the NMR.

In 3-methylpentane, the structure is CH2CH2CH(CH2CH3)CH2CH3. Wait, no, that's not possible. Wait, maybe 3-methylpentane is CH2CH2CH(CH3)CH2CH3? No, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me draw it: the structure would be CH2CH(CH2CH3)CH2CH2CH3. Wait, no, perhaps it's CH2CH2CH(CH2CH3)CH2CH3. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps it's 2-methylbutane. Wait, 2-methylbutane is pentane with a methyl branch on the second carbon. Its structure is CH2CH(CH3)CH2CH2CH3. Wait, no, perhaps that's 3-methylpentane. Wait, perhaps I'm complicating it. Maybe let's think of the splitting.

Wait, another approach: the quartet at 1.3 ppm (4H) could be a CH2 adjacent to another CH2. So perhaps it's a CH2CH2 group where each CH2 is next to another CH2. And the triplet comes from two CH3 groups attached to the central CH2. So the structure would be CH2(CH2CH3)2. Wait, but that's a three-carbon chain. Wait, no, that would be (CH2CH3)2CH2. No, that's ethyl groups attached to a central CH2. So the structure would be CH2 connected to two ethyl groups. So, like CH2(CH2CH3)2. But that's a five-carbon compound, but wait, no, that's only three carbons. Maybe I'm getting this wrong.

Alternatively, think of a central CH2 connected to two ethyl groups and another CH2. Wait, perhaps the structure is CH2CH2(CH2CH3)2. No, that's unclear. Alternatively, perhaps it's a cyclopentane derivative. Wait, I'm getting stuck here. Maybe I should think of another approach.

Wait, the initial structure must have two distinct sets of protons, so it's a symmetrical molecule. The triplet (6H) suggests two equivalent CH3 groups, each adjacent to a CH2 which is next to another CH2. The quartet (4H) is two equivalent CH2 groups. So perhaps the molecule is CH2CH2 connected to two ethyl groups on each end.

Wait, wait, maybe it's 2,2-dimethylbutane. Structure: CH2(CH3)2CH2CH3. No, wait, that's 2,2-dimethylbutane would be (CH3)2CHCH2CH3. Let me think about the NMR. The (CH3)2CH group would have a quartet because the adjacent CH2 has two H. Wait, no, maybe not. Alternatively, maybe it's 2,3-dimethylbutane? No, that's probably not symmetrical.

Wait, another thought: Maybe the structure is 2-methylpentane, but that's not symmetrical. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps it's a cyclic structure. Let's think of cyclopropane. A cyclopropane with substituents. But let me think about the NMR.

Alternatively, maybe it's a diethyl ether. Let's go back to that. Diethyl ether's structure is CH2CH3-O-CH2CH3. The NMR would show a quartet for the CH2 groups attached to O (each H in CH2 would be a quartet because each is next to two H on the adjacent CH2), and a triplet for the CH3 groups (each CH3 is next to a CH2, which has two H). So yes, that matches the given data.

But wait, diethyl ether is an ether. How would it undergo monobromination? Diethyl ether isn't typically brominated under radical conditions because ethers are not very reactive towards bromine (unlike alkenes or alkanes which can undergo substitution). So maybe that's not the right path.

Wait, perhaps the initial compound isn't an ether. Maybe it's an alkane with a specific structure. Let me think.

Another possible structure is 2,2-dimethylbutane. Let me draw it: CH2CH(CH3)2CH2CH3. Wait, no, that's not a correct structure. Oh wait, 2,2-dimethylbutane is CH(CH3)2CH2CH3, but that would have a branching. Let me think of the NMR of that. The CH2 groups would be in different environments. Hmm, perhaps not.

Wait, perhaps the structure is neohexane or something else. Alternatively, perhaps it's 3-pentane with some symmetry.

Wait, another approach: The triplet at 0.9 ppm (6H) is two CH3 groups attached to a CH2. And the quartet at 1.3 ppm (4H) is a CH2 next to another CH2. So the structure must be CH2(CH3)2CH2CH2 something? Wait, no. Or perhaps it's CH2CH2 connected to two CH3 groups on each end. Wait, maybe it's CH2CH(CH2CH3)2. No, that doesn't make sense.

Wait, perhaps it's a 2-pentyl group or something. Alternatively, perhaps the structure is (CH2CH3)2CH2. Wait, that's a four-carbon chain with two ethyl groups on the second carbon. So the structure would be CH2(CH2CH3)2. Hmm, but that gives a central CH2 connected to two ethyl groups. So the NMR would show:

The central CH2 (CH2 in the middle) would be a quartet because it's adjacent to two
