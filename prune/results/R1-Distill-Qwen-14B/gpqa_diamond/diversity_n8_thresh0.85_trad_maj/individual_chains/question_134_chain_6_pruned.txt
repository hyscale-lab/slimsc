Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm supposed to find the enthalpy of neutralization when these three solutions are mixed. Hmm, let's see. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to think this through.

The problem says we have 500 mL of 0.2 M HCl, 300 mL of 0.3 M H2SO4, and 200 mL of 0.5 M Ba(OH)2 being mixed. I remember that neutralization reactions involve acids and bases reacting to form water and a salt. Oh, and enthalpy of neutralization is usually the heat released when an acid reacts with a base. But wait, enthalpy is usually measured in kilojoules, but the options here have kcal and kJ. Hmm, I think sometimes the value is per mole of H+ or OH- reacting. Oh wait, no, usually it's per mole of acid or base, but I'm not entirely sure.

Wait, let's think about each solution and what they contribute. So, HCl is a strong acid, H2SO4 is a strong acid too, but wait, H2SO4 is diprotic. Ba(OH)2 is a strong base as well. So when you mix an acid and a base, they neutralize each other. But the thing is, we've got three solutions here, so they're all reacting together. Hmm, but how do I approach this?

Maybe I should calculate the moles of H+ from the acids and the moles of OH- from the base, then see which is in excess. Because the neutralization will only go to the limiting reagent. The excess would be the one that's left over.

So let's break it down step by step.

First, calculate the moles of HCl. HCl is a strong acid, so each mole gives one mole of H+.

Molarity is moles per liter. So 0.2 M in 0.5 L gives 0.2 * 0.5 = 0.1 moles HCl. So 0.1 moles H+.

Next, the H2SO4. It's a diprotic acid, so each mole gives two H+ ions. So 0.3 M in 0.3 L is 0.3 * 0.3 = 0.09 moles H2SO4. So that's 0.09 * 2 = 0.18 moles H+.

So total H+ from acids is 0.1 + 0.18 = 0.28 moles.

Now the base: Ba(OH)2. Ba(OH)2 is a strong base, each mole gives two OH- ions. So 0.5 M in 0.2 L is 0.5 * 0.2 = 0.1 moles Ba(OH)2. So 0.1 * 2 = 0.2 moles OH-.

Wait, but when an acid and base react, H+ + OH- → H2O. So the neutralization is H+ + OH- → H2O. So the limiting reagent here is the one with fewer moles between H+ and OH-.

We have 0.28 moles H+ and 0.2 moles OH-.

So OH- is the limiting reagent. All 0.2 moles OH- will react, and the H+ left will be 0.28 - 0.2 = 0.08 moles.

But wait, the reaction is H+ + OH- → H2O. So the enthalpy change is based on the amount that actually reacts. So the neutralization here is 0.2 moles of H+ reacting with 0.2 moles OH-.

Wait, but what about the enthalpy per mole? Oh, I think the standard enthalpy of neutralization is about -57 kJ/mol when measured per mole of H+ or OH- reacting. Because each mole of H+ and OH- combines, releasing heat. So each mole of H+ reacting gives off about 57 kJ.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused. Let me clarify. The enthalpy of neutralization for a strong acid and strong base is approximately -57 kJ per mole of H+ (or OH-) involved. So if I have 0.2 moles reacting, then the enthalpy change would be 0.2 * (-57 kJ), which is -11.4 kJ.

Wait, but wait, the options have some in kcal and some in kJ. Oh, right, 1 calorie is about 4.184 joules. So 1 kcal is 1000 cal = 1000 * 4.184 J = 4184 J. 1 kJ is 1000 J. So 1 kJ is about 0.239 kcal (since 1000 / 4184 ≈ 0.239).

So if I have -11.4 kJ, that's approximately -11.4 * 0.239 ≈ -2.72 kcal (because 11 * 0.239 is about 2.629, and 0.4 * 0.239 is ~0.095, so total around 2.72).

Wait, let me compute 11.4 * 0.239 accurately.

11.4 * 0.239:

10 * 0.239 = 2.39.

1.4 * 0.239 = 0.3346.

So total is 2.39 + 0.3346 = 2.7246. So about 2.72 kcal. But since it's exothermic, the enthalpy is negative. So -2.72 kcal.

Looking at the options, option A is -2.72 kcal. Option D is -16.0 kJ. Wait, but if I calculated it as 11.4 kJ, which would be about -11.4 kJ, which is around one of the options. But wait, the options are a mix of kJ and kcal.

Wait, the options are:

A) -2.72 kcal

B) -11.42 kcal

C) -3.80 kcal

D) -16.0 kJ

So -11.4 kJ is ~ -2.72 kcal (as 11.4 * 0.239 is 2.72). So option A is that.

But wait, another thought: when mixing H2SO4 and Ba(OH)2, perhaps they form a salt, so maybe the neutralization isn't just 1:1. Let me think. Wait, H2SO4 is diprotic, so when it reacts with a base like Ba(OH)2, which is a strong base, each mole of H2SO4 can react with two moles of OH-.

In the solution, the H2SO4 is 0.3 M * 0.3 L = 0.09 mol. So each provides 2 H+ → 0.18 mol H+.

Ba(OH)2 is 0.5 M * 0.2 L = 0.1 mol, which gives 0.2 mol OH-.

But in a neutral
