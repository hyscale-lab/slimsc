Okay, so I've got this question about stars and their distribution in the sky. Hmm, the question says to assume stars are uniformly distributed. Wait, uniform distribution in what sense? I think it means their density is uniform throughout space, so same number per volume everywhere. Oh yeah, like if you have a certain volume, the number of stars in it is the same everywhere.

The question is about how the number of stars per unit range of parallax (plx) changes with plx itself. Parallax is a measure of distance; the closer a star is, the larger its parallax. Oh right, the formula for parallax is plx = 1/distance (in parsecs). So if a star is closer, plx is bigger.

But wait, the question is about the number of stars per unit plx. So, for a given range of plx, say from plx to plx + dplx, how many stars are there in that range.

Since the stars are uniformly distributed, the number density is constant. Number density is n, so in a volume V, there are n*V stars. But here, we're considering a thin shell between plx and plx + dplx. Wait, a thin shell? Because parallax relates to distance, so each plx corresponds to a distance, and a small change in plx would correspond to a shell or a thin layer at that distance.

Wait, the parallax is inversely proportional to distance, so when plx increases (smaller distance), the shell is closer. So, the number of stars in a shell at distance d would depend on the volume of that shell.

Let me think in terms of distance. Let's say we have a range of distances from d to d + dd. The volume of a spherical shell at distance d with thickness dd is 4πd² dd. Because the volume of a sphere is (4/3)πr³, so the difference between r and r+dr is approximately 4πr² dr.

But wait, in this question, we're dealing with parallax. Since plx = 1/d (for d in parsecs), so d = 1/plx. So, let's express the shell's volume in terms of plx.

So, the volume of the shell at distance d is 4πd² dd. But since d = 1/plx, and dd is the change in d, which would correspond to a change in plx. Let me find dd in terms of dplx.

Wait, plx = 1/d. So, d = 1/plx. Taking the derivative of both sides with respect to dplx: dd = - (1/(plx²)) dplx. But since dplx is a small positive change, dd would be negative. But since we're dealing with magnitudes, perhaps we can ignore the sign and just take the absolute value. So, dd = (1/plx²) dplx.

Wait, not exactly sure about the signs, but maybe I can proceed.

So, the volume of the shell is 4πd² dd, which becomes 4π (1/plx)^2 * (1/plx²) dplx. Wait, no, wait: d is 1/plx, so d² is 1/plx². And dd is (1/plx²) dplx. So, substituting:

Volume = 4π * (1/plx)^2 * (1/plx²) dplx ? Wait, that doesn't make sense. Let me double-check the substitution.

Wait, d = 1/plx. So, d² is (1/plx)^2. And dd is the change in d. So from plx to plx + dplx, d changes from 1/plx to 1/(plx + dplx) ≈ 1/plx - (dplx)/(plx²), using a Taylor expansion. So, dd ≈ - (dplx)/(plx²). So the thickness in d is proportional to 1/plx².

So, the volume of the shell is 4π d² dd. Substituting, that's 4π (1/plx)^2 * (dplx/(plx²)).

Wait, because dd is (d dplx) but negative, but since we're considering magnitude, perhaps. So, the volume would be proportional to (1/plx²) * (1/plx²) ) = 1/plx^4. So, each shell's volume is 4π (1/plx^4) dplx.

But wait, the number of stars in that shell would be the number density multiplied by the volume. Since number density n is constant (uniform distribution), the number of stars is n * 4π (1/plx^4) dplx.

But the question is about the number of stars per unit range of plx, which is dN/(dplx) = n * 4π / plx^4.

Wait, but that gives the number as proportional to 1/plx^4. That would match option A.

Wait, but let me think again. Parallax plx is 1/d. So for a given parallax range dplx, the corresponding distance range is smaller as plx increases.

Wait, but I'm getting confused. Let me think in terms of the volume between plx and plx + dplx.

Alternatively, maybe using another approach. The number of stars in a certain volume depends on the volume. For stars uniformly distributed, number is n * Volume.

Each shell at a certain distance contributes a volume of 4πd² dd. But since d = 1/plx, we can express this in terms of plx.

So, d = 1/plx → dd = - (1/plx²) dplx.

So, volume is 4π (1/plx)^2 * (-1/plx²) dplx. But since we're considering the absolute value, it's 4π (1/plx^4) dplx.

So, the number of stars is n * 4π (1/plx^4) dplx.

So the number per unit plx is dN/dplx = 4 π n / plx^4.

Wait, so dN/dplx is proportional to 1/plx^4. But the question asks how the number of stars per unit range of plx changes with plx. So, as plx increases, the number per unit plx (dN/dplx) decreases as 1/plx^4.

Looking back at the options:

A) ~ 1/plx^4

B) ~ 1/plx^2

Wait, so according to this, the correct answer would be A.

But wait, I thought the number per unit volume is n, so maybe I'm making a mistake in the approach.

Alternatively, perhaps the number of stars per unit parallax is inversely proportional to the square of the parallax. Let me think again. Another approach: the flux.

Wait, no, the question is about number counts per unit parallax.

Wait, maybe I should think about the number of stars between plx and plx + dplx. Number is n * volume between plx and plx + dplx.

But the volume between plx and plx + dplx is the same as the volume between d and d + dd, where d = 1/plx.

But the volume for d is 4/3 π (d+dd)^3 - 4/3 π d^3 ≈ 4π d² dd.

So, V = 4π d² dd.

Expressed in terms of plx:

d = 1/plx → dd = - (dplx) / (plx^2).

So, V = 4π (1/plx)^2 * (dplx / plx²) ) = 4π (dplx) / plx^4.

Thus, number of stars is n * V = 4 π n (dplx) / plx^4.

Therefore, dN/dplx = (4 π n)/ plx^4.

Which means the number of stars per unit plx is proportional to 1/plx^4, so option A.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Let me think about the relation between distance and volume. For a thin shell at distance d, the volume is 4πd² dd. So, when you go to a higher d (lower plx), the volume per unit d increases as d^2, but per unit plx (since plx ~1/d), the volume per unit plx would be d^2 * (dd). But dd in terms of dplx is (d^2 plx^2) dplx.

Wait, no, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me think about the change in plx.

The key is that as plx increases (distance decreases), the number of stars per unit plx would be higher because the same volume element (per unit plx) corresponds to a larger volume. Wait, no, wait, wait. Let me think: for a given dN, dN is proportional to V. So, if I have a shell at plx, the volume is proportional to (1/plx)^2 * d (1/plx), which is (1/plx)^3. So, the volume per unit plx is 1/(plx^3). Hmm, but that would make the number of stars per unit plx proportional to 1/plx^3, which is option D.

Wait, that's conflicting with my earlier conclusion. So which is right?

Wait, let me re-calculate the volume again. The volume of a thin shell at distance d with thickness dd is 4πd² dd. Since d = 1/plx, dd = (d dplx) * ( - 1 / plx² ), taking the negative as positive for magnitude, so dd = (d dplx)/ (plx^2) → but wait, no, let's think: plx = 1/d → d = 1/plx. So, if plx increases by dplx, then d decreases by dd = (d) (dplx)/(plx^2) ) → because plx = 1/d → d = 1/plx, so dd = (d^2 dplx)/plx^2.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let me use calculus to find dV in terms of plx.

The volume between plx and plx + dplx is V = (4/3) π ( (1/(plx + dplx) )^3 - (1/plx)^3 )

But for small dplx, we can approximate this as 4 π (1/plx)^2 * (-d dplx)/ (plx^2). Wait, wait, let me expand (1/(plx + dplx))^3. Let me set x = plx, delta = dplx.

So, 1/(x + delta)^3 ≈ 1/x^3 - 3 (delta)/x^4 + 6 (delta^2)/x^5 - ... 

So, the difference V = (4/3 π) [ (1/(x+delta)^3 - 1/x^3 ) ] ≈ (4/3 π) [ (-3 delta)/x^4 + (6 delta^2)/x^5 ) ]

But for very small delta, the higher order terms can be neglected, so V ≈ (4/3 π) * ( -3 delta ) / x^4 ) = -4 π delta / x^4.

But delta is positive, and x is positive, so the volume V is positive and equals 4 π delta / x^4.

So, the number of stars in this volume is n * V = 4 π n delta /x^4.

So, the number of stars per unit delta plx (dN/dplx) is (4 π n ) / x^4 → which is proportional to 1/x^4, where x is plx.

So, dN/dplx is proportional to 1/plx^4, so the number of stars per unit range of plx decreases as 1/plx^4.

That would make option A correct.

Wait, but wait a moment. Let me think from another angle: the number of stars in a given volume is n, so the number per unit volume is n. So for a thin shell, the number of stars is n * (4 π d² dd ). But d is 1/plx, so dd is (d^2 / plx^2) dplx.

So substituting, number is n *4 π (1/plx)^2 * ( (1/plx)^2 dplx ) → n *4 π (1/plx^4) dplx.

So, dN/dplx = 4 π n / plx^4.

Yes, so the correct answer is A: ~1/plx^4.


To determine how the number of stars per unit range of parallax (plx) changes with plx, we assume the stars are uniformly distributed in space, meaning the number density \( n \) is constant. The parallax \( \text{plx} \) is inversely proportional to distance \( d \), such that \( \text{plx} = 1/d \). For a thin spherical shell at distance \( d \), the volume is \( 4\pi d^2 dd \), where \( dd \) is the thickness of the shell. 

Since \( d = 1/\text{plx} \), we can express \( dd \) in terms of \( \text{plx} \) as \( dd = -\frac{d\text{plx}}{\text{plx}^2} \). Substituting \( d = 1/\text{plx} \) and \( dd = \frac{d\text{plx}}{\text{plx}^2} \) (ignoring the sign for magnitude), the volume of the shell becomes:

\[
V = 4\pi \left(\frac{1}{\text{plx}}\right)^2 \cdot \frac{d\text{plx}}{\text{plx}^2} = \frac{4\pi d\text{plx}}{\text{plx}^4}.
\]

The number of stars in this shell is proportional to the product of the number density \( n \) and the volume \( V \), giving:

\[
dN = n \cdot V = n \cdot \frac{4\pi d\text{plx}}{\text{plx}^4}.
\]

Thus, the number of stars per unit range of parallax is:

\[
\frac{dN}{d\text{plx}} = \frac{4\pi n}{\text{plx}^4}.
\]

This shows that the number of stars per unit range of parallax decreases as \( \text{plx}^{-4} \). Among the given options, this corresponds to:

**A) ~ \( \text{plx}^{-4} \)**.
