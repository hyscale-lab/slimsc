Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the right starting materials for two reactions. Let me try to break this down step by step.

Alright, the problem says that a chemist performed two reactions using two different reducing agents. The products are both (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one and (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one. Wait, no, looking again, actually, the first reaction gives (R) and the second gives (S). Or wait, no, the reaction equations are:

A + LiBH4 + H+ → (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one
B + BH3 + H+ → (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one

Hmm. So A is treated with LiBH4, which is a strong reducing agent, and B is treated with BH3, which is typically a milder reagent, used in certain reductions, like maybe for ketones to secondary alcohols? Or wait, no, BH3 is a hydroboration agent, but when used with H+ it might be different. Oh wait, I think LiBH4 is a strong enough reducing agent to reduce esters or ketones, whereas BH3 might be used for something else, like maybe it's involved in the formation of alcohols through hydroboration-oxidation. Hmm, maybe I'm getting this mixed up.

Wait, but in this case, the product is a tetrahydro-pyran-2-one. So that's like a cyclic hemiacetal or something. Wait, wait, no. 4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one. So pyran is a six-membered ring with one oxygen. The 2H suggests that the double bond is between C1 and C2, perhaps? Or maybe not. Wait, pyran-2-one is like a cyclic ketone, so the ring has an oxygen and a ketone group. So 2H-pyran-2-one would have the structure where the ring has a double bond between C1 and C2, and a ketone at C2. So it's a cyclic ketone, a cyclic hemiacetal maybe? No, wait, maybe it's like a cyclic acetal. Hmm, I'm getting a bit confused.

Wait, no, tetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one. So the pyran
