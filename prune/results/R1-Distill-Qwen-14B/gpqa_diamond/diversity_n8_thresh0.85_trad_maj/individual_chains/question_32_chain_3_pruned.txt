Okay, so I'm trying to figure out the energy of the RHIC when a nucleus X is moving at 0.96c. Hmmm. Let's see. I remember that nucleus X is Li with 3 neutrons. Wait, Li usually has 3 protons, right? So if it has 3 neutrons, that's a total of 6 nucleons. So the nucleus must be Li-6. So the mass number A is 6.

Wait, but in particle physics, when they talk about nucleus energy, I think they usually consider the rest mass energy and then calculate the kinetic energy based on relativistic speeds. Oh right, because at speeds close to c, you can't use classical mechanics; you have to use special relativity.

So the formula for relativistic energy is the total energy, which is gamma multiplied by the rest energy. The rest energy is mcÂ². But wait, the question is asking for the energy of the collider, which I think refers to the kinetic energy. Or does it? Wait no, in particle accelerators, the energy given is often the kinetic energy. Or wait, sometimes it's the total energy. I'm a bit confused here.

Wait, the problem says "the energy of the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC)" so that the speed is 0.96c. So I think they're referring to the total energy. Or maybe the kinetic energy. I need to clarify.

Wait, in accelerator physics, the energy is often given as the kinetic energy. But wait, I'm not so sure. For example, in the case of the LHC, they state the proton's energy as 6.5 TeV, which is the
