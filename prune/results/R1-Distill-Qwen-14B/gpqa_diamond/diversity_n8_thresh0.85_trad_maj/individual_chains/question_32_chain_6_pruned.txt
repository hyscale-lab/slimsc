Okay, so I have this physics problem about the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) and I need to find the energy of the collider when the speed of a certain nucleus is 0.96c. Hmm, let's see. The nucleus is defined as Li with 3 neutrons. Wait, Li is lithium, right? So normally, lithium has 3 protons. If it has 3 neutrons, that makes it Li-6, because 3 protons + 3 neutrons equals 6 nucleons.

So the problem is asking for the energy of the RHIC so that the speed of the Li nucleus is 0.96 times the speed of light. I remember that in relativity, the energy of a particle depends on its gamma factor. The total energy is gamma times the rest mass energy.

First, I need to calculate the gamma factor. Gamma is 1 divided by the square root of (1 minus v squared over c squared). Here, v is 0.96c. So let me plug that into the formula. 

Gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.96)^2) 
Let me calculate (0.96)^2. 0.96 * 0.96 is 0.9216. So 1 - 0.9216 is 0.0784. The square root of 0.0784 is 0.28 because 0.28^2 is 0.0784. So gamma is 1 / 0.28, which is approximately 3.5714. Wait, let me double-check that. 1/0.28 is the same as 100/28, which is approximately 3.5714.

Now, the total energy E is gamma multiplied by the rest mass energy. The rest mass energy is m * c^2. So I need the mass of the Li nucleus. Since Li-6 has a mass of approximately 6 atomic mass units (u). Wait, the exact mass might be a bit different, but I think for this problem, they probably want us to use 6 u.

Wait, but I should check. The mass number A is 6, so the mass is about 6 u. The atomic mass unit is approximately 1.660539 × 10^-27 kg. So the rest mass m would be 6 * 1.660539e-27 kg. Let me calculate that: 6 * 1.660539 = about 9.963234e-27 kg.

So the rest mass energy is m*c². c is about 3e8 m/s. Let's compute that: 9.963234e-27 kg * (3e8 m/s)^2. Let me compute (3e8)^2 = 9e16 m²/s². Multiply by 9.963234e-27: 

9.963234e-27 * 9e16 = (9.963234 * 9) * 1e-11. 9.963234 *9 is approximately 89.669106. So 89.669106e-11 J. Wait, but that's 8.9669106e-10 J. Hmm, but usually, in particle physics, energies are expressed in GeV. So I need to convert this into GeV.

I remember that 1 eV is 1.60218e-19 joules. So to find how many eV this is, I'll divide by 1.60218e-19. 

So 8.9669106e-10 J / 1.60218e-19 J/eV = approximately (8.9669e-10) / (1.60218e-19) eV. Let me compute that: 8.9669e-10 / 1.60218e-19 = (8.9669 / 1.60218) * 1e9 ≈ 5.6e9 eV. Wait, 5.6e9 eV is 5.6 GeV. Because 1 GeV is 1e9 eV.

Wait, but wait. Let me redo that calculation more accurately. 8.9669106e-10 divided by 1.60218e-19. 

Let me compute 8.9669e-10 / 1.60218e-19. 

First, 8.9669e-10 is 8.9669 x 1e-10. 1.6021
