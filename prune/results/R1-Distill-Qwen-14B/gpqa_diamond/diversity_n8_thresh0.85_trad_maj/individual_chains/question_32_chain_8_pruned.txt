Okay, so I have this question about the energy of the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC), and I need to find out what energy is required so that the speed of a certain nucleus is 0.96c. Hmm, the nucleus is Li with 3 neutrons. Wait, Li is lithium, right? So, lithium has an atomic number of 3. If it has 3 neutrons, then the isotope would be Li-6 because 3 protons + 3 neutrons = 6 nucleons. So the mass number is 6, making it a helium-6 isotope? No, wait, no. Lithium has 3 protons, and 3 neutrons gives it a mass number of 6. So it's Li-6.

Alright, so the nucleus in question is Li-6. I need to find the energy the RHIC must have to accelerate these nuclei to 0.96 the speed of light. I remember that in particle accelerators, the kinetic energy is often a significant fraction of the rest mass energy when speeds are a large portion of c. But wait, this is about the total energy, or just the kinetic? Let me think. The question says "the energy of the RHIC", which I think refers to the kinetic energy imparted to the nuclei. Or does it refer to the total energy (which includes rest mass energy)? Hmm, wait, in accelerator physics, the energy usually refers to the kinetic energy, but sometimes it's the total energy. Wait, RHIC is a heavy ion collider, so it collides beams of heavy ions. The energy per beam is given as the kinetic energy, I think. Or is it the total energy? Hmm, I'm a bit confused. Let me think: for non-relativistic speeds, kinetic energy is (1/2)mv², but when speeds are relativistic, kinetic energy is (gamma -1)mc². So, if the problem is asking for the energy, I think it's the total energy, which is gamma * m c². But wait, sometimes in accelerators, the energy given is the kinetic. So I need to clarify.

Wait, the question says, "the energy of the RHIC so that the speed of the nucleus X is equal to 0.96c." So, the energy is what allows the nucleus to reach that speed. That would imply that it's the kinetic energy because the speed is determined by the energy imparted. Hmm. Alternatively, in relativity, the total energy includes rest mass energy. So, perhaps I should compute the total energy (gamma * m c²) and then subtract the rest mass energy to get the kinetic energy. Let's see.

First, I need the mass of the Li-6 nucleus. Since it's a nucleus, it's approximately equal to the sum of the masses of its protons and neutrons, minus the binding energy (which is usually negligible when calculating approximate masses). So, the mass of Li-6 is roughly the mass of 3 protons and 3 neutrons. Each proton is about 1.007276 GeV/c², and each neutron is about 1.008665 GeV/c². Wait, wait, the mass of a proton is approximately 938 MeV/c², which is 0.938 GeV. Similarly, neutron is about 939.565 MeV, so 0.939
