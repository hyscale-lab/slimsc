Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here. Let me try to figure it out step by step. Hmm, the question is about an electron state and some operator. Let me read it again.

The state is |alpha> proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>. Oh, so it's a spin-1/2 system, right? The |up> and |down> are eigenstates of the z-projection of the spin operator.

So the first part is to calculate the probability of measuring the eigenstates of another operator. Wait, this operator has a matrix representation Aij where Aij is hbar/2 if i is not equal to j, and zero otherwise. Oh wait, no, wait. Wait, the operator has elements Aij = hbar/2 when i is different from j, else zero. So, let's think about the matrix form.

For a two-level system, the basis states are |up> and |down>. So the matrix would be 2x2. The diagonal elements (i=j) are zero. The off-diagonal elements (i≠j) are hbar/2. So the matrix would look like:

[ [0, hbar/2], [hbar/2, 0] ]

Wait, no. Wait, no, wait. Wait, the operator is A, and Aij is hbar/2 when i != j, and 0 otherwise. So for a 2x2 matrix, it's [[0, hbar/2], [hbar/2, 0]]. So this is the Pauli X matrix multiplied by hbar/2. Because the Pauli X matrix is [[0,1],[1,0]], right?

So that operator A is (hbar/2) times sigma_x, where sigma_x is the Pauli X matrix. Oh wait, the Pauli matrices are 2x2. So sigma_x is [[0,1],[1,0]], so A is (hbar/2) sigma_x.

Wait, the eigenstates of sigma_x are the eigenstates of this operator A. Because A is proportional to sigma_x. So the eigenstates of A are the same as those of sigma_x.

What are the eigenstates of sigma_x? They're the superpositions (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2) and (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2), right? Because sigma_x flips the states. So the eigenstates are aligned along the x-axis in the Bloch sphere.

So the question is, we have the state |alpha> expressed in the z-basis, and we need to find the probabilities of measuring it in the eigenstates of A, which are the x-basis.

Wait, but the first part of the question says to calculate the probability of measuring the particle in each of the eigenstates of the operator. So it's asking for the probabilities when you measure in the x-basis.

So the steps are:

1. Normalize the state |alpha> because it's given as proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>.
2. Express |alpha> in the x-basis, or find the overlap with the eigenstates of A to get the probabilities.

Alternatively, the probabilities are the square of the absolute values of the inner products between |alpha> and each eigenstate of A.

Wait, but maybe it's easier to rewrite |alpha> in terms of the x-basis states and then find the coefficients, whose squares will give the probabilities.

Wait, okay. Let's proceed.

First, normalize |alpha>. The given state is |alpha> = (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>. To normalize it, we calculate the norm squared.

The norm squared is |1+i|^2 + |2-i|^2.

Compute |1+i|²: (1)^2 + (1)^2 = 2.

Compute |2 - i|²: (2)^2 + (-1)^2 = 4 +1=5.

So total norm squared is 2 +5 =7. So the norm is sqrt(7), so the normalized state is |alpha> = [ (1+i)|up> + (2 -i)|down> ] / sqrt(7).

Next, the eigenstates of operator A are |+x> = (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2) and |-x> = (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2).

We need to compute the inner products between |alpha> and |+x>, and with |-x>, then take their squared magnitudes to get the probabilities.

Compute < +x | alpha >.

|+x> is (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2). So,

<+x | alpha> = [ ( <up| + <down| ) / sqrt(2) ] * [ (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down> ] / sqrt(7) )

Which equals [ (1+i) + (2-i) ] / (sqrt(2)*sqrt(7)) )

Wait, wait, let me compute it correctly.

Each term: the inner product is the sum over the components. So:

= [ (1+i) * (1) + (2 -i) * (1) ) ] / ( sqrt(2) * sqrt(7) )

Wait, no. Wait, when you have <a| (b|c> + d|e> ), it's b <a|c> + d <a|e>.

So < +x | alpha > = [ (1+i) < up | up > + (2-i) < down | up > ] / (sqrt(2) * sqrt(7)) )

Similarly, < down | up > is zero. So this becomes [ (1+i) * 1 + (2 -i) *0 ] / (sqrt(14)) )

= (1+i) / sqrt(14).

Wait, that can't be right. Wait, wait, perhaps I'm making a mistake here. Let me think again.

Wait, |+x> is (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2). So when you take the inner product with |alpha>, which is (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>, divided by sqrt(7), you have:

(1+i)/sqrt(7) * < up | up >/sqrt(2) + (2-i)/sqrt(7) * < up | down > / sqrt(2) )

Wait no, wait, no. Let me write it properly.

The inner product is:

< +x | alpha > = [ (1/sqrt(2)) ( <up| + < down| ) ] * [ (1+i)/sqrt(7) |up> + (2-i)/sqrt(7) |down> ]

= (1/sqrt(2)) [ (1+i)/sqrt(7) < up | up > + (2-i)/sqrt(7) < up | down > + (1+i)/sqrt(7) < down | up > + (2-i)/sqrt(7) < down | down > ]

But < up | down > and < down | up > are zero. So only the terms where the states match survive.

So,

= (1/sqrt(2)) [ (1+i)/sqrt(7) *1 + (2-i)/sqrt(7) *1 ]

= [ (1+i + 2 -i ) ] / ( sqrt(2) * sqrt(7) )

Wait, let me compute the numerator:

(1+i) + (2 -i) = 3.

Wait, 1 + i + 2 -i = 3. So numerator is 3.

So,

< +x | alpha > = 3 / ( sqrt(2) * sqrt(7) ) ) = 3 / sqrt(14)

The probability is the square of the absolute value, which is (3^2)/(14) ) = 9/14 ≈ 0.642857.

Wait, that's about 0.643. Hmm, checking the options, one of them is 0.64 and 0.36. So that's roughly matching.

Now, let's compute the other inner product, which is < -x | alpha >.

| -x > is (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2).

So,

< -x | alpha > = [ (1/sqrt(2)) ( <up| - < down| ) ] * [ (1+i)/sqrt(7) |up> + (2-i)/sqrt(7) |down> ]

= (1/sqrt(2)) [ (1+i)/sqrt(7) < up | up > - (1+i)/sqrt(7) < up | down > + (2-i)/sqrt(7) < down | up > - (2-i)/sqrt(7) < down | down > ]

Again, cross terms are zero. So,

= (1/sqrt(2)) [ (1+i)/sqrt(7) *1 + ( - (2 -i) ) / sqrt(7)*1 ]

So,

= [ (1+i) - (2 -i) ] / ( sqrt(2)*sqrt(7) )

Compute numerator: (1+i -2 +i ) = (-1 + 2i )

So,

= (-1 + 2i ) / sqrt(14)

The absolute value squared is [ (-1)^2 + (2)^2 ] / 14 = (1 +4)/14 =5/14 ≈ 0.357.

Wait, but wait, that can't be right. Because the two probabilities should add up to 1.

Wait, I have 9/14 ≈0.6428 and 5/14 ≈0.357.

Hmm, 9/14 is approximately 0.6428 and 5/14 is approximately 0.357, which adds to 14/14=1. So that's correct.

Looking at the options, option A has 0.64 and 0.36, which is close. Also, option B
