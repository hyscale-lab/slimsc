Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's see what it's about. The question is about the speed of light in a moving glass medium. Hmm, I remember from my high school physics that when light travels through a medium, its speed changes based on the medium's refractive index. But wait, the glass here is moving, so that adds another layer to the problem.

The setup is this: a light beam is propagating through glass with index of refraction n. The glass is moving at a constant velocity v in the same direction as the beam and toward the observer in the lab. The question is asking what the speed of light in the glass is relative to the observer in the lab. Oh, and we take the speed of light in a vacuum as c=1.

So the options are A through D, each with different formulas. I think I need to apply some relativity here, maybe the addition of velocities because the medium (glass) is moving.

Wait, okay, in the glass, the light's speed is normally c/n, right? Because the refractive index n is c divided by the speed in the medium. So speed in the medium is v_medium = c/n. But wait, no, wait. If n is the refractive index, then the speed in the medium is v = c/n. So in the glass, the light is moving at v = 1/n, since c=1.

But the glass itself is moving at velocity v in the same direction as the light beam. So from the lab frame, what's the observed speed of the light?

Hmm. I think I need to use the velocity addition formula from special rel
