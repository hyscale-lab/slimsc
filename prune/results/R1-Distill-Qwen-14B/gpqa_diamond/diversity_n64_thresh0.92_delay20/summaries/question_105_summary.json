The star has a radius equal to the Sun's, an effective temperature of 6000 K, and one hemisphere covered in dark spots with a filling factor of 20%. The spots are cooler, with a temperature of 5000 K. The goal is to find the exoplanet's radius relative to the star's radius, \\( R_{\\text{pl}} / R_{\\text{star}} \\), such that the brightness variation caused by the planet matches the amplitude of the variation caused by the spots.\n\n### Key Calculations:\n1. **Spot Area and Fraction of the Star's Surface**:\n   - The star's total surface area is \\( 4\\pi R_{\\text{star}}^2 \\).\n   - One hemisphere has a filling factor of 20%, meaning 20% of the hemisphere's area is covered by spots. The hemisphere's area is \\( 2\\pi R_{\\text{star}}^2 \\), so the area covered by spots is:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Spot area} = 0.2 \\times 2\\pi R_{\\text{star}}^2 = 0.4\\pi R_{\\text{star}}^2.\n     \\]\n   - The fraction of the star's total surface area covered by spots is:\n     \\[\n     f = \\frac{\\text{Spot area}}{\\text{Total area}} = \\frac{0.4\\pi R_{\\text{star}}^2}{4\\pi R_{\\text{star}}^2} = 0.1 \\, (10\\%).\n     \\]\n\n2. **Brightness Variation Due to Spots**:\n   - The flux from a star is proportional to its surface area and the fourth power of its temperature. The fractional change in flux when the spots are visible is:\n     \\[\n     \\Delta F = f \\cdot \\frac{T_{\\text{eff}}^4 - T_{\\text{spot}}^4}{T_{\\text{eff}}^4}.\n     \\]\n   - Substituting \\( T_{\\text{eff}} = 6000 \\, \\text{K} \\) and \\( T_{\\text{spot}} = 5000 \\, \\text{K} \\):\n     \\[\n     T_{\\text{eff}}^4 = (6000)^4 = 1296 \\times 10^{12}, \\quad T_{\\text{spot}}^4 = (5000)^4 = 625 \\times 10^{12},\n     \\]\n     \\[\n     \\Delta F = 0.1 \\cdot \\frac{1296 \\times 10^{12} - 625 \\times 10^{12}}{1296 \\times 10^{12}} = 0.1 \\cdot \\frac{671 \\times 10^{12}}{1296 \\times 10^{12}} \\approx 0.1 \\cdot 0.5177 = 0.05177.\n     \\]\n   - Thus, the brightness variation amplitude due to the spots is approximately \\( 5.177\\% \\).\n\n3. **Brightness Variation Due to an Exoplanet**:\n   - When an exoplanet transits the star, the fractional change in brightness is:\n     \\[\n     \\Delta F_{\\text{planet}} = \\left(\\frac{R_{\\text{pl}}}{R_{\\text{star}}}\\right)^2.\n     \\]\n   - To match the amplitude of the spot-induced variation, set:\n     \\[\n     \\left(\\frac{R_{\\text{pl}}}{R_{\\text{star}}}\\right)^2 = 0.05177.\n     \\]\n   - Solving for \\( R_{\\text{pl}} / R_{\\text{star}} \\):\n     \\[\n     \\frac{R_{\\text{pl}}}{R_{\\text{star}}} = \\sqrt{0.05177} \\approx 0.2275.\n     \\]\n\n4. **Reconciling with the Options**:\n   - The calculated value \\( R_{\\text{pl}} / R_{\\text{star}} \\approx 0.2275 \\) does not match any of the provided options. However, if the problem interprets the filling factor as 20% of the entire star's surface (not just one hemisphere), the spot area would be:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Spot area} = 0.2 \\times 4\\pi R_{\\text{star}}^2 = 0.8\\pi R_{\\text{star}}^2.\n     \\]\n     - The fraction of the star's surface covered by spots would then be:\n       \\[\n       f = \\frac{\\text{Spot area}}{\\text{Total area}} = \\frac{0.8\\pi R_{\\text{star}}^2}{4\\pi R_{\\text{star}}^2} = 0.2 \\, (20\\%).\n       \\]\n     - Recomputing the brightness variation:\n       \\[\n       \\Delta F = 0.2 \\cdot \\frac{T_{\\text{eff}}^4 - T_{\\text{spot}}^4}{T_{\\text{eff}}^4} = 0.2 \\cdot 0.5177 = 0.1035.\n       \\]\n     - Setting \\( \\left(\\frac{R_{\\text{pl}}}{R_{\\text{star}}}\\right)^2 = 0.1035 \\), we find:\n       \\[\n       \\frac{R_{\\text{pl}}}{R_{\\text{star}}} = \\sqrt{0.1035} \\approx 0.3217.\n       \\]\n   - This matches option **D (~0.32)**.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe problem likely intends the filling factor to represent 20% of the entire star's surface, not just one hemisphere. Under this interpretation, the radius of the exoplanet relative to the star is approximately \\( 0.32 \\), corresponding to option **D**.\n\nANSWER: D"
