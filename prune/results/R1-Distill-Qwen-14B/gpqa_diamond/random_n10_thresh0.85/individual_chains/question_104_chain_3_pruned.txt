Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through step by step. Let me read it again.

So, the question is about exoplanets detected using the radial velocity (RV) method. There are two stars, each with the same mass as the Sun. Each has a planet with a mass similar to Neptune. Both planets are in circular orbits.

Planet #1 causes a 5 milliangstrom periodic shift in the spectral lines of its star. Planet #2's star shows a shift of 7 milliangstrom. The question asks how many times longer the orbital period of planet #2 is compared to planet #1.

Hmm, I remember that the RV method detects the Doppler shift in the star's spectrum due to the planet's gravitational pull, causing the star to wobble. The shift in the spectral lines relates to the star's velocity towards and away from us.

The formula I think is involved here is the one relating the semi-amplitude of the RV (K) to the orbital period (P), the mass of the planet (M_p), the mass of the star (M_s), and other constants. 

Wait, the radial velocity semi-amplitude K is given by the formula:

K = (v) = (2πG)^(1/3) * (M_p sin i) / ( (M_s + M_p)^(2/3) * (P)^(1/3) ) ) * (1 / c )

But wait, since M_p is much smaller than M_s (Neptune's mass is about 17 Earth masses, while the Sun is much bigger), M_s + M_p ≈ M_s. So, we can approximate it as K ≈ ( (2πG)^(1/3) * M_p sin i ) / ( M_s^(2/3) * P^(1/3) * c )

Since both stars have the same mass as the Sun and the planets have similar masses (Neptune-like), M_p and M_s are the same for both planets. Also, sin i is probably the same because the orbits are circular, which I think implies that the inclination is 90 degrees, so sin i is 1 for both. So, sin i is 1 for both.

So, the formula for K would be proportional to (M_p) / (M_s^(2/3) * P^(1/3) )

Wait, but K is the velocity, which is inversely proportional to the cube root of the period. Because rearranging the formula, K is proportional to (M_p) / (P^(1/3)) ), since M_s is the same for both.

So, K1 / K2 = (P2 / P1)^(1/3) ) * (M_p2 / M_p1 )

But wait, M_p1 and M_p2 are similar to Neptune, so perhaps we can assume they're the same. So M_p1 ≈ M_p2.

So, K1/K2 = (P2/P1)^(1/3)

Wait, no, rearranging the formula. Let me think again.

From K = (2πG)^(1/3) * (M_p sin i) / (M_s^(2/3) (P)^(1/3) ) * (1/c )

Assuming M_p1 = M_p2, and M_s is same for both, then K is inversely proportional to P^(1/3).

So, K ∝ 1/(P^(1/3)).

Therefore, K1 / K2 = (P2 / P1)^(1/3 )

Wait, let's square this. If K is proportional to 1/(P^(1/3)), then K1 is proportional to 1/(P1^(1/3)), and K2 is proportional to 1/(P2^(1/3)).

So, K1 = (constant) * (1 / P1^(1/3) )

Similarly, K2 = (constant) * (1 / P2^(1/3) )

Taking the ratio K1/K2 = (P2/P1)^(1/3 )

Wait, wait, that doesn't seem right. Let me think again.

If K ∝ 1/(P^(1/3)), then K is inversely proportional to the cube root of P. So higher K means shorter period.

So, K1 = C / P1^(1/3), K2 = C / P2^(1/3)

So K1 / K2 = (C/P1^(1/3)) ) / (C/P2^(1/3)) ) = (P2/P1)^(1/3 )

Ah, right. So:

K1/K2 = (P2 / P1 )^(1/3 )

Wait, but in the problem, K1 is 5 milliangstrom, K2 is 7 milliangstrom. So K2 is larger than K1.

So the ratio K1/K2 is 5/7 ≈ 0.714.

So,

0.714 = (P2 / P1 )^(1/3 )

Cube both sides:

(0.714)^3 ≈ (0.714 * 0.714 * 0.714) ≈ let's compute that.

0.7^3 is 0.343. 0.714 is a bit more. Let me compute 0.714 * 0.714.

0.7 * 0.7 is 0.49. 0.014 * 0.7 * 2 = 0.0196. 0.014^2 is 0.000196. So (0.7 +0.014)^2 is approximately 0.49 + 2*(0.7)(0.014) + (0.014)^2 = 0.49 + 0.0196 + 0.000196 ≈ 0.509796.

Then multiply that by 0.714 again.

0.509796 * 0.714 ≈ Let's compute:

0.5 * 0.714 = 0.357.

0.009796 * 0.714 ≈ approx 0.00698.

So total is approximately 0.357 + 0.00698 ≈ 0.36398.

So (0.714)^3 ≈ 0.364.

So,

(P2/P1) = (0.714)^3 ≈ 0.364.

So P2 is approximately 0.364 times P1.

Wait, but the question
