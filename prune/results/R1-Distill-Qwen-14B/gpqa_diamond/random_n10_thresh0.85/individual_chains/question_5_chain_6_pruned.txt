Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Hmm, it's about finding the eigenvector of a certain operator. Let me try to break this down step by step.

First, the problem says the operator is P, and we're looking at a muon's spin along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane. The eigenvalue is +ħ/2. Oh wait, I remember that spin operators are related to Pauli matrices. So the operator P must be a spin operator, like the Pauli matrices scaled by ħ/2.

The components of P (Px, Py, Pz) are given as 2x2 matrices multiplied by ħ/2. Let me write them down:

Px = (ħ/2) * [[0, 1], [1, 0]]
Py = (ħ/2) * [[0, -i], [i, 0]]
Pz = (ħ/2) * [[1, 0], [0, -1]]

Wait, the eigenvalue is +ħ/2. Since P is the operator along the direction n, which is in the x-z plane, so n has components (nx, 0, nz). So the operator P should be the vector sum of Px, Py, and Pz, but weighted by the direction. So P = nx*Px + ny*Py + nz*Pz. But since n is in the x-z plane, ny=0. So P = nx*Px + nz*Pz.

But wait, the direction vector n is arbitrary in x-z. So n is (nx, 0, nz), and it's a unit vector, so nx² + nz² = 1.

But the eigenvector we're looking for has eigenvalue +ħ/2. So we're solving (P) |v> = (ħ/2)|v>?

Wait, but I'm a bit confused. The operator for spin in direction n is usually given by (n · σ) * ħ/2, where σ are the Pauli matrices. So the operator P here is (n · σ) * ħ/2. So the eigenvalues for this operator are ±ħ/2. So the problem says the eigenvalue is +ħ/2, so the eigenvector corresponds to the spin-up state along n.

So to find the eigenvector, we need to find |v> such that P|v> = (ħ/2)|v>.

Since P = nx*Px + nz*Pz (since ny=0), let's substitute the expressions for Px and Pz.

So P = (nx * [Px_matrix]
