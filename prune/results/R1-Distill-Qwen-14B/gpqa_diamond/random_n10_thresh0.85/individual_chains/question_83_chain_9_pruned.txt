Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about titrating acetic acid. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to break it down step by step.

Alright, the problem says we're diluting 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid with 20.00 cm³ of water. Then we titrate that with 0.1 M NaOH. The question is about finding the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point. The options are A to D.

Wait, so first, I think I need to figure out what's happening at 25% titration. 25% of what? Oh right, the equivalence point volume. So I should probably calculate the volume of NaOH needed to reach the equivalence point first.

But before that, let's think about the initial solution after dilution. We have 20 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid. When we dilute it with 20 cm³ of water, the total volume becomes 40 cm³, right? Wait, wait no, 20 plus 20 is 40 cm³, which is 0.04 liters. So the concentration will change due to dilution.

The initial moles of acetic acid (CH3COOH) are moles = concentration × volume (in liters). So 0.05 M × 0.02 L = 0.001 moles. Oh wait, because 20 cm³ is 0.02 liters. So yeah, 0.05 * 0.02 = 0.001 moles.

After adding 20 cm³ of water, the new volume is 40 cm³. So the concentration is moles / new volume. That's 0.001 moles / 0.04 L = 0.025 M. So the diluted solution is 0.025 M acetic acid.

Now, when titrating with NaOH, which is a strong base, it will react with the acetic acid. The reaction is CH3COOH + NaOH → CH3COO^-Na+ + H2O.

The equivalence point is when moles of NaOH equal moles of acetic acid. So the initial moles of acetic acid is 0.001. Since NaOH is 0.1 M, the volume needed is (moles)/(concentration) = 0.001 / 0.1 = 0.01 L, which is 10 cm³.

Wait wait, but wait. The initial solution after dilution is 40 cm³. When titrated with 0.1 M NaOH, the equivalence point volume is 10 cm³. So at 25% titration, that's 25% of 10 cm³, which is 2.5 cm³ of
