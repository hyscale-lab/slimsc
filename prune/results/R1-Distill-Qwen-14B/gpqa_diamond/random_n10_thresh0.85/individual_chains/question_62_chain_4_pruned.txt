Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the correct sequence of reagents to synthesize a specific compound from ethynylcyclohexane. The target is 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. Hmm, that's a mouthful. Let me break it down.

First, I should probably sketch the structures to get a better idea. Ethynylcyclohexane is cyclohexane with an ethynyl group (which is like a carbon-carbon triple bond attached, so it's CH2-Câ‰¡CH). The target molecule has a cyclohexyl group attached to a (hydroxy)methyl group, which is itself attached to another cyclohexane ring with a carbaldehyde (CHO) group. So, structurally, I think the molecule is something like a cyclohexane ring with a CH(OH)(cyclohexyl) group and a CHO group attached.

Wait, no. Let me clarify. The target is 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. So the main chain is cyclohexane with substituents. The substituents would be at position 1. The substituent is a cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl group, which is CH(OH)(cyclohexyl), and also a carbaldehyde group on the same carbon? Or maybe the main ring is cyclohexane, and the substituent is a methyl group with an OH and cyclohexyl, and then the same carbon has the aldehyde. So the structure is cyclohexane with a substituent that's CH(OH)(cyclohexyl)-CHO? Wait, no, maybe the substituent is (cyclohexyl)(hydroxy)methyl attached to the cyclohexane, and then another aldehyde group on that same carbon? Or maybe the aldehyde is on a different part.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is a cyclohexane ring where one carbon has a substituent that's a methyl group attached to both a hydroxyl group and a cyclohexyl group. And that same carbon has a formyl (CHO) group. So, that carbon is attached to three things: cyclohexyl, OH, and CHO. But wait, that's four substituents (the main ring, cyclohexyl, OH, and CHO). No, wait, the main ring is cyclohexane, so each carbon is part of the ring. So perhaps the substituent is attached to one of the ring carbons. Let me think: the substituent is (cyclohexyl)(hydroxy)methyl, so that's a methyl group attached to a cyclohexyl and an OH group. Then, the same carbon in the ring also has a carbaldehyde group. So the substituent is CH(OH)(cyclohexyl), and on the same carbon, there's a CHO group. But that would make it CH(OH)(cyclohexyl)CHO? That seems crowded, but perhaps it's possible.

Alternatively, maybe it's a cyclohexane ring with a substituent that's a methyl group attached to the ring. That methyl group has a hydroxyl group and a cyclohexyl group attached to it, and also a formyl group. So, structure-wise, the substituent is (CH(OH)(cyc
