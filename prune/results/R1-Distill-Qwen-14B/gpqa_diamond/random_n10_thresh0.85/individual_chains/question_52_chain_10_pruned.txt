Okay, so I have this question about stars and their spectra. Hmm, let's try to unpack it step by step. So, the question is about the ratio of neutral titanium atoms in two energy levels changing when the star has spots. I remember that the ratio depends on the temperature because of the Boltzmann equation.

Wait, the star has spots that cover 40% of its surface. When the spots aren't there, the effective temperature is 6000 K, but when 40% are covered, the overall Teff drops to 5500 K. Oh, but how does that affect the photosphere's conditions?

The question is about the ratio of the number of Ti atoms in two energy levels. The ratio is n1/n2. And it's observed that this ratio decreases when the star has spots. So, without spots, the ratio is higher, and with spots, it's lower. 

In LTE (Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium), the ratio of populations of two energy levels is given by the Boltzmann factor: n1/n2 = (g1/g2) * exp( -(E2 - E1)/(k*T) ). Since the ratio decreases when the temperature decreases, that makes sense. Because when T is lower, the exponential term gets smaller, so n1/n2 decreases.

Wait, but what's the transition wavelength given? It's 1448 Å, which is in the near UV or far UV range. So, that's about 1448 Angstroms, which is 144.8 nm. Hmm, that's in the extreme ultraviolet. But I don't know if that's directly relevant, unless the question is about the ionization state, but the question says it's neutral Ti, so maybe not. Because ionization would be a bigger effect on the number of neutral atoms.

But wait, the effective temperature of the star changes, so the photosphere's temperature changes. Since spots are cooler, when 40% is covered, the overall photospheric effective temperature drops, but wait, wait. Wait, the star's overall luminosity would change because some areas are cooler. But when spots are present, do they emit less? So, the star's total light is less, but the question is about the photosphere's conditions. Oh, the question says, when 40% is covered, the overall photospheric Teff is 5500 K. So, the effective temperature of the entire photosphere is lower. So, the Ti atoms are in a lower temperature environment.

So, the ratio n1/n2 is (g1/g2) * exp( -ΔE/(k T) ). Assuming that the ground state is level 1 and the excited state is level 2, so E2 > E1, so ΔE is positive. So, when T decreases, the exponent becomes a larger negative number, so the exponential term becomes smaller. So, n1/n2 decreases when T decreases. That's why when the star has spots (lower T overall), the ratio is lower.

The question is, what's the factor by which the ratio changes when the star doesn't have spots compared to when it does (so, ratio without spots divided by ratio with spots). So, factor = (n1/n2)_no_spots / (n1/n2)_with_spots.

But wait, the ratio without spots is higher, so the
