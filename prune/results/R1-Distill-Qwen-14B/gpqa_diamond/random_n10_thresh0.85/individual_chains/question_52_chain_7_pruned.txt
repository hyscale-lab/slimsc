Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question is about.

The problem says that astronomers are studying a star with certain characteristics. The star's radius is 1.5 solar radii, and its mass is 1.1 solar masses. When there are no dark spots on the surface, the effective temperature (Teff) is 6000 K. But when 40% of the surface is covered by spots, the overall Teff drops to 5500 K. 

Then, the question is about the ratio of the number of neutral Ti atoms in two energy levels. When the star has spots, this ratio decreases. I need to find the factor by which this ratio changes when the star is without spots compared to when it has spots. The transition corresponds to a wavelength of about 1448 Ã…, and we can assume LTE (Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium) holds in the photosphere.

Hmm. So, I think this has to do with the Boltzmann equation, which relates the population of different energy levels in a gas. The Boltzmann factor tells us how the number of atoms in two energy levels compares based on temperature.

The Boltzmann equation is: (n2)/(n1) = (g2/g1) * exp( - (E2-E1)/(k T) )

Here, n1 and n2 are the number of atoms in levels 1 and 2, respectively. g1 and g2 are the statistical weights. E2 and E1 are the energies of the levels, and k is Boltzmann's constant, T is temperature.

Wait, but the problem says that when the star has spots, the ratio (n2/n1) decreases. So without spots, the ratio is higher, and with spots, it's lower. Because when the star is cooler (spots present, Teff=5500 K), the ratio is lower.

Wait, but why does the ratio decrease when it's cooler? Let me think. The ratio n2/n1 depends exponentially on temperature. So if temperature decreases, the exponent becomes a larger negative number, making the ratio smaller. So when the star is cooler (spots present), n2/n1 is lower. That makes sense because lower temperature means less thermal energy to excite atoms to higher energy levels.

So the question is, what's the factor by which this ratio changes when without spots (T=6000 K) compared to with spots (T=5500 K). So the factor is (n2/n1)_6000 / (n2/n1)_5500.

Alternatively, it's the ratio of the ratios. So let's compute (n2/n1) at 6000 K divided by (n2/n1) at 5500 K.

Wait, but the problem is about the ratio of the number of neutral Ti atoms in levels 1 and 2. So the ratio is n2/n1, and when the star has spots, this ratio is lower. So the factor is (n2/n1)_no_spots / (n2/n1)_spots.

So the steps I need to take:

1. Find the ratio (n2/n1) at T1=6000 K and T2=5500
