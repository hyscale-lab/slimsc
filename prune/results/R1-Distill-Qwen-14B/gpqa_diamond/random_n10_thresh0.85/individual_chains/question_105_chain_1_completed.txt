Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here. Let me try to figure it out step by step. Hmm.

Alright, the question is about a star with some dark spots and how that affects the observed brightness variations. The problem says that when only one hemisphere is spotty, the variations in brightness can look like an exoplanet transit. We need to find the radius of such a hypothetical exoplanet that would produce the same amplitude in the light curve.

Wait, let's break down the given information.

The star has a radius equal to the Sun, so R_star = R_sun. The effective temperature (Teff) is 6000 K. One hemisphere is covered by dark spots with a filling factor of 20%. Filling factor is the fraction of the surface area covered, right? So filling factor f = 0.20. The temperature difference between the spots and the rest is 1000 K. So spots are cooler by 1000 K, since they are dark.

The spots cause the star's brightness to dip as the star rotates and these spots come into view. But the problem says that this dip looks similar to the dip caused by a planet transiting in front of the star. So, we're to find the planet radius such that the brightness variation is the same amplitude as the spot-induced variation.

I remember that the amplitude of the light curve (the depth of the dip) depends on the size of the blocking area relative to the star's disk. For a planet transit, the dip is (Rp / R_star)^2, because the area blocked is a circle with radius Rp, so area is π Rp², and the star's area is π R_star². So the fractional area is (Rp/Rstar)^2.

But in the case of spots, it's a bit different. The spots are cooler, so when they rotate into view, the star's overall brightness decreases because those cooler regions are contributing less light. But how is this amplitude calculated?

Each spot covers a certain area. The total change in brightness (delta L) will be the difference between the flux from the unspotted surface and the spotted surface, multiplied by the filling factor.

Wait, the flux from the star is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann law: L = 4π R² σ Teff^4. But since we're dealing with the change, perhaps we can consider the fractional change in flux.

When a spot is present, the flux from that area is lower. The spots have a temperature of Teff - 1000 K, which is 5000 K. So the flux from each spot is sigma * T_spot^4, and the surrounding areas are sigma * T_star^4.

The flux from one hemisphere is the sum of the spotted regions and the unspotted regions. So the total flux from the hemisphere is (f * A_spot * sigma T_spot^4) + ( (1-f) * A_spot * sigma T_star^4 ), where A_spot is the area per spot? Wait no, maybe I should model the entire hemisphere.

Wait, the star's surface is a sphere, so when we're looking at the star, we see a disk with radius R_star. The area is π R_star². The hemisphere that's spotty is half of that, so area is (1/2) π R_star².

Wait, no. Wait, the star is a sphere, so the total surface area is 4π R². Each hemisphere is 2π R². But when observed, we see the disk area, which is π R². So the area we see is π R², which is the same as the area of a hemisphere. So when a spot is on the hemisphere facing us, it affects the observed flux.

Hmm, perhaps it's better to model the change in flux as the star rotates. When the spots are on the visible hemisphere, the total flux is lower.

But wait, the problem says that the entire hemisphere is covered with spots. So the entire hemisphere (which is 50% of the star's surface) has 20% of its area covered by spots. So the fraction of the star's surface covered by spots, as seen from Earth, is 0.5 * 0.20 = 0.10, or 10% of the star's surface.

Wait no, because the spots are on a single hemisphere. So when the star rotates, that hemisphere comes into view. So when the spotty hemisphere is facing us, the spots (which cover 20% of that hemisphere) are visible. When it's the other hemisphere, those spots are on the back side and not visible.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. The star is observed as it rotates, and the spots are on one hemisphere. So when the star rotates, the spots come into view and out of view, causing the observed brightness to dip.

But the problem states that the situation can resemble an exoplanet transit. So when the star is showing the spotty hemisphere, the brightness is lower because of the spots, and when it's the other hemisphere, it's normal.

But when the star is not covered by spots, what would the amplitude be? Wait, the question says "if the star was not covered by spots!" So we need to find the planet radius such that the transit depth is the same as the depth caused by the spots.

So the brightness dip when the planet transits is (Rp / Rstar)^2, as I thought before.

On the other hand, the dip caused by the spots is (flux without spots) minus (flux with spots) divided by (flux without spots). The flux change depends on the area of the spots and the temperature difference.

Let me formalize this. The total flux from the star is the sum of flux from all regions. When spots are present on the visible hemisphere, part of the flux is less.

The flux from the star without any spots is F0 = σ Teff^4 * A, where A is the area of the star (π R_star²). But when spots are present, the flux F is F0 minus the flux lost due to the spots.

Each spot has area A_spot = f * A_hemi, where f is the filling factor (0.20) and A_hemi is the area of the hemisphere visible to us. Wait, no. The filling factor is the fraction of the hemisphere's surface that's covered by spots. So the area of spots on the visible hemisphere is f * A_hemi, where A_hemi is the area of the hemisphere, which is (1/2) * 4π R², but wait, the observed area is a disk of radius R, so the area is π R², which is half of the star's surface area (since the full surface is 4π R²). So the area of the hemisphere (as seen from Earth) is π R².

Wait, maybe I should think in terms of the star's surface area. The entire star has area 4π R². The visible hemisphere (facing us) has area 2π R². The spots are on this hemisphere, covering 20% of that. So the area covered by spots is 0.20 * 2π R² = 0.4 π R².

So when the star is in the spotty configuration (the spotted hemisphere facing us), the flux from the star is:

F_spots = (Area without spots) * σ T_eff^4 + (Area spots) * σ (T_eff - ΔT)^4

The area without spots on the hemisphere is 2π R² - 0.4 π R² = 1.6 π R².

So,

F_spots = (1.6 π R²) σ (6000)^4 + (0.4 π R²) σ (5000)^4

The normal flux (without any spots) when the unspotted hemisphere is facing us would be:

F_normal = 2 π R² σ (6000)^4

Wait, no. Because when the other hemisphere is facing us (the unspotted one), the entire 2π R² area is at T_eff, so F_normal = 2 π R² σ (6000)^4.

Wait, but actually, the star's total flux is the sum of all the surface areas. So when the spotty hemisphere is facing us, the flux is F_spots = (Area spotted) * σ T_spot^4 + (Area unspotted on hemisphere) * σ T_eff^4.

But the area unspotted on the hemisphere is (2π R² - 0.4 π R²) = 1.6 π R².

So F_spots = [1.6 π R² * (6000)^4 σ ] + [0.4 π R² * (5000)^4 σ ]

The normal flux (when the hemisphere is unspotted) is F_normal = 2π R² * (6000)^4 σ.

The change in flux, delta F, is F_normal - F_spots.

The amplitude of the brightness variation is (delta F) / F_normal.

So delta F = F_normal - F_spots = 2π R² (6000)^4 σ - [1.6 π R² (6000)^4 σ + 0.4 π R² (5000)^4 σ ]

= [2 π R² (6000)^4 - 1.6 π R² (6000)^4 - 0.4 π R² (5000)^4 ] σ

= [0.4 π R² (6000)^4 - 0.4 π R² (5000)^4 ] σ

Factor out 0.4 π R² σ:

= 0.4 π R² σ [ (6000)^4 - (5000)^4 ]

So the fractional change is (delta F) / F_normal = [0.4 π R² σ (6000^4 - 5000^4 ) ] / [2 π R² σ (6000^4) ]

Simplify: 0.4 / 2 * [ (6000^4 -5000^4)/ 6000^4 ]

0.2 * [ 1 - (5000/6000)^4 ]

Calculate (5000/6000) = 5/6 ≈ 0.8333.

(5/6)^4 ≈ (0.8333)^4 ≈ approx 0.482253.

So 1 - 0.482253 ≈ 0.517747.

Multiply by 0.2: 0.2 * 0.517747 ≈ 0.10355.

So the fractional change in flux is about 0.10355, or 10.355% dip.

Wait, but wait a second. When the star is showing the spotty hemisphere, the flux is lower, so the dip is F_normal - F_spots. So the amplitude (the dip) is about 10.355% of the flux.

But the planet's transit dip is (Rp/Rstar)^2. So setting (Rp/Rstar)^2 = 0.10355.

Taking the square root: Rp/Rstar = sqrt(0.10355) ≈ 0.3218, so about 0.32.

But wait, looking at the options, option D is ~0.32. Option A is ~0.39, which is higher.

But wait, did I make a miscalculation?

Let me double-check the numbers.

Wait, the calculation:

(5000/6000) is 5/6 ≈ 0.833333.

(5/6)^4 = (625/1296) ≈ 0.482253.

So 1 - 0.482253 = 0.517747.

Multiply by 0.2: 0.2 * 0.517747 ≈ 0.10355.

So the dip is about 10.355%, which is the same as the planet's (Rp/Rstar)^2.

So (Rp/Rstar) = sqrt(0.10355) ≈ 0.3218, so about 0.32, which is option D.

But wait, wait. Another approach: perhaps the area of the spots is 20% of the hemisphere, and the hemisphere is 50% of the star's surface. So the fraction of the star's surface covered by spots is 0.2 * 0.5 = 0.1, or 10%.

But when the star rotates, the spots are on the visible hemisphere, so the change in flux is based on the area of the spots (0.1 of the star's area) but at a lower temperature.

Wait, but in the previous calculation, I considered the area of the spots as 0.4 π R². Let me think again.

Wait, the star's total surface area is 4π R². The hemisphere facing us is 2π R². The spots cover 20% of that hemisphere, so 0.2 * 2π R² = 0.4 π R². So the area of the spots is 0.4 π R², which is (0.4 π R²) / (4 π R²) )= 0.1 or 10% of the total star's surface.

So when the spots are on the visible hemisphere, the area contributing less flux is 10% of the star's surface. But the entire star's surface is emitting, but the spots are cooler.

Wait, perhaps the change in flux is (area of spots) * (delta T^4 / T_eff^4 ), multiplied by a factor.

Alternatively, the change in flux when the spots are present is (F_spots) = F_normal - (area_spots) * (Teff^4 - T_spot^4) * (sigma),

Because each spot's contribution is less. So the fractional change would be (delta F) / F_normal = [ (area_spots) (Teff^4 - T_spot^4) ] / [ (area_total) Teff^4 ) ]

Wait, let's model it that way.

The area_spots is 0.4 π R², as before.

The total area visible is 2 π R². So the fractional area covered by spots is 0.4 π R² / 2 π R² = 0.2, which is 20% of the visible area, which matches the filling factor.

But when the star is showing the spotty hemisphere, the total flux is:

F_visible = (2 π R² - 0.4 π R²) * sigma Teff^4 + 0.4 π R² * sigma (Teff - 1000)^4

Which is what I did earlier.

The other approach: the change in flux is (delta F) = F_normal - F_spots.

But wait, the star's total flux without any spots would be the sum of all parts, but when a hemisphere is spotted, the flux is lower.

Wait, perhaps I need to think in terms of the star's total flux when a hemisphere is spotted.

Alternatively, considering that the spots are cooler, the change in flux is the difference between the flux when the hemisphere is unspotted and when it's spotted.

Wait, I think my initial approach was correct. So the dip is about 10.35%, leading to Rp/Rstar ≈ 0.32, which is option D.

But wait, another thought: when the star is rotating and the spots are on the other side, the flux is at maximum. When the spots come into view, the flux drops. So the amplitude is the difference between maximum and minimum flux.

So yes, the fractional dip is about 0.1035, so (Rp/Rstar)^2 = 0.1035, so Rp/Rstar ~ 0.32, which matches option D.


To determine the radius of a hypothetical exoplanet that would produce the same brightness variation as the star with dark spots, we analyze the fractional change in flux caused by the spots and compare it to the flux change caused by a planet transit.

### Key Information:
1. **Star Properties**:
   - Radius: \( R_{\text{star}} = R_{\odot} \)
   - Effective Temperature: \( T_{\text{eff}} = 6000 \, \text{K} \)
   - One hemisphere is covered in dark spots with a filling factor of \( f = 0.20 \), meaning 20% of the visible hemisphere's area is covered by spots.
   - Temperature of spots: \( T_{\text{spot}} = T_{\text{eff}} - 1000 \, \text{K} = 5000 \, \text{K} \).

2. **Flux Change Due to Spots**:
   - The flux from the star is proportional to the Stefan-Boltzmann law: \( F \propto T^4 \).
   - When the spotty hemisphere is visible, the total flux is:
     \[
     F_{\text{spots}} = (1 - f) \cdot A_{\text{hemisphere}} \cdot T_{\text{eff}}^4 + f \cdot A_{\text{hemisphere}} \cdot T_{\text{spot}}^4
     \]
     where \( A_{\text{hemisphere}} = \pi R_{\text{star}}^2 \) is the area of the visible hemisphere.
   - The normal flux (when the unspotted hemisphere is visible) is:
     \[
     F_{\text{normal}} = A_{\text{hemisphere}} \cdot T_{\text{eff}}^4
     \]
   - The fractional change in flux is:
     \[
     \frac{\Delta F}{F_{\text{normal}}} = 1 - \frac{F_{\text{spots}}}{F_{\text{normal}}}
     \]
     Substituting:
     \[
     \frac{\Delta F}{F_{\text{normal}}} = 1 - \frac{(1 - f) \cdot T_{\text{eff}}^4 + f \cdot T_{\text{spot}}^4}{T_{\text{eff}}^4}
     \]
     Simplify:
     \[
     \frac{\Delta F}{F_{\text{normal}}} = f \cdot \left( 1 - \left( \frac{T_{\text{spot}}}{T_{\text{eff}}}\right)^4 \right)
     \]
     Using \( f = 0.20 \), \( T_{\text{eff}} = 6000 \, \text{K} \), and \( T_{\text{spot}} = 5000 \, \text{K} \):
     \[
     \frac{\Delta F}{F_{\text{normal}}} = 0.20 \cdot \left( 1 - \left( \frac{5000}{6000} \right)^4 \right)
     \]
     Calculate \( \left( \frac{5000}{6000} \right)^4 \approx 0.482253 \):
     \[
     \frac{\Delta F}{F_{\text{normal}}} = 0.20 \cdot (1 - 0.482253) = 0.20 \cdot 0.517747 \approx 0.10355
     \]
     Thus, the fractional change in flux is approximately \( 10.355\% \).

3. **Exoplanet Transit**:
   - The fractional change in flux during a transit is:
     \[
     \frac{\Delta F}{F_{\text{normal}}} = \left( \frac{R_{\text{planet}}}{R_{\text{star}}} \right)^2
     \]
   - Setting the transit depth equal to the flux change caused by the spots:
     \[
     \left( \frac{R_{\text{planet}}}{R_{\text{star}}} \right)^2 = 0.10355
     \]
     Solve for \( \frac{R_{\text{planet}}}{R_{\text{star}}} \):
     \[
     \frac{R_{\text{planet}}}{R_{\text{star}}} = \sqrt{0.10355} \approx 0.3218
     \]

4. **Conclusion**:
   - The radius of the exoplanet relative to the star is approximately \( 0.32 \), which corresponds to **Option D**.

Answer: D
