Okay, so I need to find the concentration of calcium ions in a solution where there's a Ca-EDTA complex. The solution given is 0.02 M of that complex. The problem says the pH is ideal, which I guess means that the EDTA is fully deprotonated and available to form complexes. The stability constant, K_Ca-EDTA, is 5x10^10. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think through it.

I remember that EDTA is a chelating agent and forms complexes with metal ions like calcium. The complex here is Ca-EDTA. So the reaction is something like Ca²+ + EDTA^4- ↔ CaEDTA²−, right? The stability constant, K, for this reaction would be given by K = [CaEDTA²−]/([Ca²+][EDTA^4-]).

Wait, but wait, I'm a bit confused about the stoichiometry. The problem says it's a 1:1 complex, so that's correct. So the complex is formed from one Ca²+ and one EDTA^4-.

Given that, the initial concentration of the Ca-EDTA complex is 0.02 M. Since the solution is ideal pH, EDTA is completely in the form that can bind Ca²+. So, the complex dissociates into Ca²+ and EDTA^4-.

Let me set up the variables. Let’s denote [CaEDTA²−] as 0.02 M initially. But wait, when it dissociates, it produces Ca²+ and EDTA^4-. Let’s say the change is x. So, the complex dissociates as:

CaEDTA²− ↔ Ca²+ + EDTA^4-
Initial: 0.02 M, 0, 0
Change: -x, +x, +x
Equilibrium: 0.02 - x, x, x

But wait, since the K is so large (5x10^10), which means the dissociation is not favored. So, the reverse is favored, meaning the complex doesn't dissociate much. So x would be very small. So, 0.02 - x ≈ 0.02.

So, substituting into the K expression:

K = [CaEDTA²−]/([Ca²+][EDTA^4-]) = (0.02) / (x * x) = 0.02 / x².

We know K is 5x10^10, so:

5e10 = 0.02 / x² → x² = 0.02 / 5e10 → x² = 2e-3 / 5e10 → Wait, 0.02 is 2e-2. So 2e-2 / 5e10 = (2/5) * 1e-12 → 0.4e-12 → x² =4e-13 → x = sqrt(4e-13) → 2e-6.5? Wait, sqrt(4e-13) is 2e-6.5? Wait, 1e-13's square root is 1e-6.5, which is about 3.16e-7. So, 2e-6.5 is 6.32e-7. So x ≈ 6.32e-7 M.

But wait, that would be the concentration of both Ca²+ and EDTA^4−?

Wait, but wait, [Ca²+] is x? Because each mole of complex dissociates into one mole each of Ca²+ and EDTA^4−. So yes, [Ca²+] is x.

So [Ca²+] is approx 6.3e-7 M. Looking at the options, option C is 6.3x10^-7 M. So that's the answer.

Let me double-check. [Ca²+] is x, which is sqrt(0.02 / 5e10). Let me calculate that more accurately.

0.02 is 2e-2. So 2e-2 /5e10 = (2/5) * 1e-12 = 0.4e-12. So x² = 0.4e-12 → x = sqrt(0.4e-12).

What's sqrt(0.4)? Approximately 0.63245. So sqrt(0.4e-12) is 0.63245e-6, which is 6.3245e-7. So around 6.3e-7, which matches option C.


To determine the concentration of calcium ions ([Ca²⁺]) in a solution containing 0.02 M of the Ca-EDTA complex, we start by considering the dissociation equilibrium:

\[
\text{CaEDTA}^{2-} \leftrightarrow \text{Ca}^{2+} + \text{EDTA}^{4-}
\]

The stability constant is given as \( K_{\text{Ca-EDTA}} = 5 \times 10^{10} \), and the initial concentration of the complex is 0.02 M. At equilibrium, the concentration of the complex is approximately \( [\text{CaEDTA}^{2-}] \approx 0.02 \, \text{M} \) (since \( K \) is very large, dissociation is minimal). Let the concentrations of \( \text{Ca}^{2+} \) and \( \text{EDTA}^{4-} \) at equilibrium be \( x \). The equilibrium expression is:

\[
K = \frac{[\text{CaEDTA}^{2-}]}{[\text{Ca}^{2+}][\text{EDTA}^{4-}]} = \frac{0.02}{x^2}
\]

Substituting \( K = 5 \times 10^{10} \):

\[
5 \times 10^{10} = \frac{0.02}{x^2}
\]

Rearranging:

\[
x^2 = \frac{0.02}{5 \times 10^{10}} = \frac{2 \times 10^{-2}}{5 \times 10^{10}} = \frac{2}{5} \times 10^{-12} = 0.4 \times 10^{-12}
\]

Taking the square root:

\[
x = \sqrt{0.4 \times 10^{-12}} = \sqrt{0.4} \times 10^{-6} \approx 0.632 \times 10^{-6} = 6.32 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M}
\]

Since \( x \) represents the equilibrium concentration of \( \text{Ca}^{2+} \), we find:

\[
[\text{Ca}^{2+}] \approx 6.3 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M}
\]

Comparing this result with the options, the correct answer is:

**C) \( 6.3 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M} \)**
