Okay, so I'm trying to figure out the maximum speed of a relativistic harmonic oscillator. Hmm, I remember that in classical mechanics, the maximum speed of a harmonic oscillator is given by v_max = sqrt(kA²/m), right? But wait, this is a relativistic case, so things must be different because of the speed limit—c.

In the relativistic scenario, the energy considerations change. I think the total energy of the oscillator includes both rest mass energy and kinetic energy. The total energy E would be the sum of the rest energy (mc²) and the kinetic energy, which in the relativistic case isn't just (1/2)mv². Instead, it's more complicated because of the Lorentz factor γ.

So, the potential energy in a harmonic oscillator is (1/2)kx². At maximum amplitude A, the potential energy is (1/2)kA². But in the relativistic case, when the mass is at maximum displacement, all the energy is potential. As it moves towards equilibrium, this potential converts into kinetic energy.

Wait, but wait. The total energy of the system is the sum of the rest energy and the kinetic plus potential energies. Or is it that the oscillator's total energy includes both types of energy? I'm a bit confused here. Let me think again.

In the classical case, the total mechanical energy is (1/2)kA², which is the maximum potential energy. So the maximum speed occurs when all potential energy converts to kinetic, giving (1/2)mv_max² = (1/2)kA², leading to v_max = sqrt(kA²/m), which is option C. But since this is a relativistic problem, I can't use that.

In relativity, the kinetic energy is (γ - 1)mc². So, the total mechanical energy E should be the sum of the rest energy and the kinetic energy, which is E = γ mc². Or wait, maybe the total energy is the sum of the rest energy and the kinetic energy. So, E = mc² + K, where K is the kinetic energy.

Wait, no. The total energy in relativity is E = γ mc², which includes the rest energy. So, the mechanical energy (kinetic plus potential) must be equal to (γ - 1) mc², because E = γ mc² = mc² + K. So K = (γ - 1) mc².

But in the oscillator, the total mechanical energy is the maximum potential energy, which is (1/2)kA². So, setting this equal to K, which is (γ - 1) mc². Hmm, but wait, the potential energy at maximum amplitude is (1/2)kA², which is the maximum possible, so all that energy is converted into kinetic at the equilibrium point.

Wait, no, because in the oscillator, the potential and kinetic energies oscillate between each other. So at x = A, all energy is potential, and at x=0, all is kinetic. So in the relativistic case, the maximum kinetic energy is (1/2)kA²? Wait that can't be right because relativistic kinetic energy is more complicated.

Alternatively, maybe the maximum kinetic energy is when all the potential energy is converted into kinetic. So, the maximum kinetic energy K_max is (1/2)kA². But K_max should also equal (γ -1) mc². So setting them equal:

(1/2) k A² = (γ - 1) mc².

But wait, in the relativistic case, is the potential energy (1/2)k x² still valid? Because in relativity, the forces might be different, but the problem states that it's obeying Hooke's law, F = -k x. So the potential would still be (1/2)k x², I think. So that part remains the same.

So back to the equation:

(1/2) k A² = (γ - 1) m c².

We can solve for γ here. γ is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²), so substituting that in:

(1/2) k A² = [ (1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²)) - 1 ] m c².

Let me rearrange this. Let me write this equation as:

(1/2) (k A²) / (m c²) ) = (γ - 1)/1.

Let me denote (k A²)/(2 m c²) as a variable to simplify. Let me call it β: β = (k A²)/(2 m c²). Then the equation becomes:

β = (γ - 1).

So,

γ = β + 1.

But γ is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²), so:

1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = 1 + β.

Let me solve for v.

Take reciprocals on both sides:

sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = 1/(1 + β).

Square both sides:

1 - v²/c² = 1/( (1 + β)^2 ).

So,

v²/c² = 1 - 1/( (1 + β)^2 ).

v² = c² [ 1 - 1/(1 + β)^2 ].

We can expand 1/(1 + β)^2 as 1/(1 + 2β + β²). But maybe it's better to express it in terms of β. Let me compute the right-hand side:

1 - 1/(1 + β)^2 = [ (1 + β)^2 - 1 ] / (1 + β)^2.

Expanding numerator:

(1 + 2β + β²) - 1 = 2β + β².

So,

v² = c² [ (2β + β²) / (1 + β)^2 ].

Factor numerator: β(2 + β) over denominator (1 + β)^2.

But let's substitute β back in terms of the given variables. Remember β = (k A²)/(2 m c²).

So,

v² = c² [ (2 (k A²)/(2 m c² ) + (k A²/(2 m c²))² ) / ( 1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²) )^2 ) ]

Simplify numerator terms:

First term: 2 * [ (k A²)/(2 m c²) ] = (k A²)/( m c² )

Second term: [ (k A² )/(2 m c² ) ]^2 = (k² A^4)/(4 m² c^4 )

So the numerator is (k A²/(m c²) ) + (k² A^4)/(4 m² c^4 )

The denominator is (1 + (k A²)/(2 m c² ))^2 = [ (2 m c² + k A² )/(2 m c²) ) ]^2.

Wait, perhaps there's a better way to handle this. Let me factor the numerator. Let me factor out (k A²)/( m c² ) from the numerator:

Numerator = (k A²/( m c² )) [ 1 + (k A²)/(2 m c² ) * (1/(2 m c² )) ??? Hmm, maybe not. Alternatively, perhaps it's better to factor the numerator differently.

Wait, let me compute the numerator and denominator:

Numerator:

2β + β² = 2*(k A²/(2 m c² )) + (k A²/(2 m c² ))^2

= (k A²)/(m c²) + (k² A^4)/(4 m² c^4 )

Denominator:

(1 + β )^2 = (1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 ))^2.

So, putting it together:

v² = c² [ ( (k A²/(m c²)) + (k² A^4)/(4 m² c^4 ) ) / (1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 ))^2 )

Let me factor out (k A²/(2 m c² )) from the numerator:

Wait, numerator = (k A²/(m c² )) [ 1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 ) ].

So numerator = (k A²/( m c² )) * [ 1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 ) ]

Denominator is [ 1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 ) ]^2.

So the entire fraction becomes:

( (k A²/(m c² )) * [ 1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 ) ] ) / ( [ 1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 ) ]^2 )

Simplify: the [1 + ...] terms cancel one from numerator and denominator. So,

= (k A²/(m c² )) / (1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 )) )

= [ (k A²) / (m c²) ) ] / [ (2 m c^2 + k A^2 ) / (2 m c^2 ) ) ]

Which simplifies to:

= [ (k A^2) / (m c^2) ) ] * [ 2 m c^2 / (2 m c^2 + k A^2 ) ) ]

The m c^2 terms cancel:

= [ k A^2 * 2 m c^2 ] / [ m c^2 (2 m c^2 + k A^2 ) ) ]

Wait, no: let me recompute that:

After flipping the denominator and multiplying:

= (k A² / (m c²)) * (2 m c²) / (2 m c² + k A² )

So,

= (k A² * 2 m c² ) / ( m c² (2 m c^2 + k A² ) ) )

The m c^2 in numerator and denominator cancels:

= (2 k A²) / (2 m c^2 + k A^2 )

So,

v² = c² * [ 2 k A² / (2 m c^2 + k A^2 ) ]

Take square roots:

v = c * sqrt( 2 k A^2 / (2 m c^2 + k A^2 ) )

I can factor numerator and denominator:

Numerator: 2 k A^2 = 2 (k A^2)

Denominator: 2 m c^2 + k A^2 = (2 m c^2) (1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2) )

So,

v² = c² * [ 2 (k A^2) ] / [ 2 m c^2 (1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2) ) ) ]

Simplify:

= c² * [ (2 k A²) / (2 m c^2) (1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 )) ) ]

The 2's and m c^2 terms:

= c² * (k A^2 )/( m c^2 ) ) * 1/(1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 ) )

So,

= c² * (k A^2/(m c^2 )) * 1/( 1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 ) )

The c² cancels with 1/(m c^2 ), leaving 1/m:

= (k A^2 / m ) * 1/( 1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 ) )

So,

v = sqrt( (k A^2 / m ) / (1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 )) )

But wait, the options don't have this form. Let me manipulate it to get it into terms that match the options.

Let me factor (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 ) as a term. Let me let lambda = (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 )

So lambda = (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 )

Then,

v = sqrt( (2 m c^2 lambda ) / ( m ) ) / (1 + lambda )

Wait, let me rethink:

Wait, (k A^2)/(m ) = 2 m c^2 * lambda.

Because lambda = (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 )

So,

k A^2 = 2 m c^2 lambda.

Thus, (k A^2)/m = 2 m c^2 lambda * (1/m ) ) = 2 c^2 lambda.

So,

v = sqrt( 2 c^2 lambda / (1 + lambda ) )

= c * sqrt( 2 lambda / (1 + lambda ) )

But lambda is (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 )

So,

2 lambda = (k A^2)/( m c^2 )

So,

sqrt(2 lambda / (1 + lambda )) = sqrt( (k A^2/( m c^2 )) / (1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 )) )

Hmm, perhaps another approach. Let me express v as:

v = c * sqrt( [2 (k A^2/(2 m c^2 )) ] / [ 1 + (k A^2/(2 m c^2 )) ] )

Wait, because:

v = c * sqrt( (2 * lambda ) / (1 + lambda ) )

But lambda is (k A^2 )/(2 m c^2 )

So,

v = c * sqrt( [ 2 * (k A^2/(2 m c^2 )) ] / (1 + (k A^2/(2 m c^2 )) ) )

Simplify numerator:

2*(k A^2/(2 m c^2 )) = (k A^2)/(m c^2 )

So,

v = c * sqrt( (k A^2/(m c^2 )) / (1 + (k A^2/(2 m c^2 )) ) )

Hmm, but this doesn't match the options given. Let me look at the options again.

Option A: c * sqrt( 1 + 1/(1 - (k A²)/(2 m ))^2 )

Option B: c * sqrt(1 + 1/(1 - (k A²)/(2 m c² )) )

Option C: sqrt( k A²/m )

Option D: c * sqrt(1 - 1/(1 + (k A²)/(2 m c^2 ))^2 )

Wait, my expression for v is:

v = c * sqrt( (k A²/(m c^2 )) / (1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 )) )

Which can be written as:

v = c * sqrt( ( (k A^2)/(m c^2 ) ) / (1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 )) )

Let me factor out (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 ) from the denominator.

Wait, denominator is 1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 ) = [ 2 m c^2 + k A^2 ] / (2 m c^2 )

So,

v = c * sqrt( ( (k A^2)/(m c^2 )) * (2 m c^2 )/(2 m c^2 + k A^2 ) )

Simplify:

= c * sqrt( [ 2 k A^2 * m c^2 ] / [ m c^2 (2 m c^2 + k A^2 ) ] ) )

Wait, no: (k A^2)/(m c^2 ) ) * (2 m c^2 ) = 2 k A^2.

So,

v = c * sqrt( (2 k A^2 ) / (2 m c^2 + k A^2 ) )

But this is the same as before. Hmm.

Let me factor numerator and denominator by 2 m c^2.

So,

(2 k A^2 ) / (2 m c^2 (1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 )) )

So,

v = c * sqrt( [ (2 k A^2 )/(2 m c^2) ) ] / (1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 )) )

Which simplifies to:

v = c * sqrt( [ (k A^2)/(m c^2 ) ] / (1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 )) )

Hmm, not sure but perhaps I can write the fraction inside as (1/(something)).

Alternatively, perhaps we can express the fraction as:

[ (k A^2)/(m c^2 ) ) ] / [1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 ) ) ]

= [ (2 m c^2 * (k A^2)/(m c^2 )) ) / (2 m c^2 + k A^2 ) ]

Wait, that's 2 m c^2 multiplied by (k A^2)/(m c^2 ) is 2 k A^2.

Wait, sorry, perhaps it's better to write:

Let me denote mu = (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 )

Then,

v = c * sqrt( (2 mu ) / (1 + mu ) )

Wait, no: because mu = (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 )

So,

( k A^2 )/(m c^2 ) ) = 2 mu.

So,

v = c * sqrt( (2 mu ) / (1 + mu ) )

= c * sqrt( 2 mu / (1 + mu ) )

Hmm, but this doesn't seem to match any of the options.

Looking back at the options, option B is:

v_max = c * sqrt( 1 + 1/(1 - (k A²)/(2 m c^2 )) )

Wait, that can't be right because when (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 ) is small, the denominator is near 1, and the expression inside sqrt would be about 1+1=2. So v_max approaches c*sqrt(2), which doesn't make sense because for small amplitudes, v_max should approach the classical result, which is sqrt(k A^2/m )=sqrt( (k A^2)/(m )).

But in the non-relativistic case, the maximum speed is sqrt(k A^2/m ). So for option B, when (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 ) is very small, let's see:

Option B's expression becomes:

sqrt(1 + 1/(1 - (small )) ) ≈ sqrt(1 + 1/(1) ) = sqrt(2) → v_max ≈ c sqrt(2 ). But this is not matching the non-relativistic limit.

Wait, but in the non-relativistic limit, when (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 ) → 0, let's see what my expression gives:

v = c * sqrt( (2 mu )/(1 + mu ) ) where mu is small.

≈ c * sqrt( 2 mu / 1 ) → c * sqrt(2 mu )

But mu = (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 )

So,

v ≈ c * sqrt( 2 * (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 ) ) = c * sqrt( (k A^2)/( m c^2 ) )

= c * sqrt( k A^2 ) / (c sqrt(m) )

Wait, no: square root of (k A^2/( m c^2 )) is (k A)/(c sqrt(m)).

So,

v ≈ c * (k A)/( c sqrt(m) ) ) = (k A) / sqrt(m )

But the correct non-relativistic limit is sqrt( k A^2 / m ) which is (k A ) / sqrt( m ), which matches. So my expression seems to have the correct limit.

But looking back at the options, which one would match this? Let me see.

Looking at the options again:

Option C is sqrt(k A²/m ), which is the non-relativistic case. So in the relativistic case, our expression should reduce to this when (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 ) is small.

In our expression, v is c multiplied by sqrt( fraction ), which for small (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 ), the fraction is (k A²/(m c² )) / (1 + ... ) ≈ (k A²/(m c² )) → so v ≈ c * sqrt( k A²/(m c^2 ) ) ) = sqrt( k A² / m ) because c^2 cancels with 1/c^2 inside the sqrt.

So yes, when non-relativistic, it's correct.

But looking at the options, none of them seem to directly match. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps I should approach this from energy conservation.

The maximum speed occurs when all the potential energy is converted into kinetic energy.

In the oscillator, the potential energy at maximum displacement is (1/2)k A^2.

The total mechanical energy E is this potential energy, which equals the kinetic energy at the equilibrium point.

In relativity, the kinetic energy is K = (γ-1) m c².

So,

(1/2) k A^2 = (γ -1 ) m c².

Solving for γ:

γ = 1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c² )

But γ = 1/ sqrt(1 - v²/c² )

So,

1/ sqrt(1 - v²/c² ) = 1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c² )

Let me denote (k A^2) / (2 m c^2 ) as μ.

So,

1/ sqrt(1 - v²/c² ) = 1 + μ.

Take reciprocal:

sqrt(1 - v²/c² ) = 1/(1 + μ )

Square both sides:

1 - v²/c² = 1/(1 + μ )^2.

Rearranged:

v²/c² = 1 - 1/(1 + μ )^2.

Expressed as:

v²/c² = [ (1 + μ )^2 -1 ] / (1 + μ )^2.

Expanding numerator:

(1 + 2 μ + μ^2 ) - 1 = 2 μ + μ^2.

So,

v²/c² = (2 μ + μ^2 ) / (1 + μ )^2.

Factor numerator: μ (2 + μ ) / (1 + μ )^2.

But wait, let me factor μ (1 + 2 μ + μ^2 )? Hmm, perhaps not.

Alternatively, express as:

v²/c² = (μ (2 + μ )) / ( (1 + μ )^2 )

= μ (2 + μ ) / (1 + 2 μ + μ^2 )

But not sure if that helps.

But wait, let's express 2 + μ as (1 + (1 + μ )).

Wait, perhaps another approach. Let me write μ as:

μ = (k A^2) / (2 m c^2 )

So,

2 + μ = 2 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 ) = [4 m c^2 + k A^2 ] / (2 m c^2 )

Hmm, not sure if it's useful.

Alternatively, I can write the numerator as:

2 μ + μ² = μ (2 + μ )

Denominator is (1 + μ )^2.

So,

v²/c² = [ μ (2 + μ ) ] / (1 + μ )^2.

Take square root:

v/c = sqrt( [ μ (2 + μ ) ] / (1 + μ )^2 )

= sqrt( μ (2 + μ ) ) / (1 + μ )

But this seems complicated.

Wait, let me compute [ μ (2 + μ ) ] = 2 μ + μ².

Hmm, I can factor that as μ (2 + μ ), which doesn't seem to help.

Alternatively, maybe I can write the expression in terms of (1 + μ )^2.

Wait, (1 + μ )^2 = 1 + 2 μ + μ².

So the numerator is 2 μ + μ² =  (1 + 2 μ + μ² ) -1 = (1 + μ )^2 -1.

Wait, no: 2 μ + μ² is not (1 + μ )^2 -1.

(1 + μ )^2 = 1 + 2 μ + μ².

So,

(1 + μ )^2 -1 = 2 μ + μ².

So,

v²/c^2 = [ (1 + μ )^2 - 1 ] / (1 + μ )^2.

Which gives:

v²/c^2 = 1 - 1/(1 + μ )^2.

So,

v = c sqrt(1 - 1/(1 + μ )^2 )

But μ is (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 )

So,

v = c sqrt(1 - 1/(1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 ))^2 )

Wait, that's option D.

Option D says: v_max = c * sqrt(1 - 1/(1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 ))^2 )

Which matches our expression.

But wait, let me check the steps again.

We had:

v²/c² = 1 - 1/(1 + μ )^2.

So,

v = c * sqrt( 1 - [1/(1 + μ )^2 ] )

Which is option D.

So, the correct answer should be option D.


To determine the maximum speed \( v_{\text{max}} \) of a 1-dimensional relativistic harmonic oscillator with mass \( m \), maximum amplitude \( A \), and obeying Hooke's law \( F = -kx \), we analyze the system using relativistic energy considerations. The total mechanical energy of the oscillator is conserved and includes both rest energy and relativistic kinetic energy.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Energy Conservation**:  
   The total mechanical energy \( E \) of the oscillator is the sum of the rest energy \( mc^2 \) and the relativistic kinetic energy \( K \). At maximum amplitude \( A \), all energy is potential energy, given by \( \frac{1}{2}kA^2 \). At equilibrium (where the speed is maximum), all potential energy is converted into kinetic energy. Thus:
   \[
   \frac{1}{2}kA^2 = (\gamma - 1)mc^2,
   \]
   where \( \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}} \) is the Lorentz factor.

2. **Solving for \( \gamma \)**:  
   Rearranging the energy equation:
   \[
   \gamma = 1 + \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}.
   \]

3. **Relating \( \gamma \) to \( v \)**:  
   Substituting \( \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}} \), we get:
   \[
   \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}} = 1 + \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}.
   \]
   Taking the reciprocal and squaring both sides:
   \[
   1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2} = \frac{1}{\left(1 + \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}\right)^2}.
   \]
   Rearranging for \( v^2/c^2 \):
   \[
   \frac{v^2}{c^2} = 1 - \frac{1}{\left(1 + \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}\right)^2}.
   \]
   Taking the square root:
   \[
   v = c \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{\left(1 + \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}\right)^2}}.
   \]

4. **Matching the Options**:  
   Comparing this result with the given options, we find that it matches **Option D**:
   \[
   v_{\text{max}} = c \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{\left(1 + \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}\right)^2}}.
   \]

### Verification of Non-Relativistic Limit:
For small amplitudes where \( \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2} \) is negligible, the expression simplifies to:
\[
v_{\text{max}} \approx \sqrt{\frac{kA^2}{m}},
\]
which matches the classical result. This confirms the correctness of the relativistic expression.

### Conclusion:
The correct answer is:

**Answer: D**
