Okay, so I've got this physics problem to solve, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm not super confident with electrostatics, but I'll try to work through it step by step.

Alright, the problem says we have an isolated system of 13 identical particles, each with charge 2e. Wait, e is the elementary charge, right? So each has a charge of 2 times 1.6e-19 coulombs. So that's 3.2e-19 C each. But wait, maybe I should just keep it as 2e for now and plug in the numbers later.

So, 12 of these charges are constrained to stay at 2 meters from a point P. The 13th charge is fixed at P. I need to find the minimum energy of this system. Hmm, energy in electrostatic systems is usually the electric potential energy. So the question is about calculating the potential energy of this configuration.

Wait, since the system is isolated, all the charges are fixed except maybe the 13th, which is fixed. So the energy would be the sum of the potential energies between each pair of charges, right? Because the potential energy is stored in the system due to the arrangement of the charges.

But wait, wait. The 13th charge is fixed at point P. The other 12 are each at a distance of 2 meters from P. So each of the 12 charges is at a distance r=2m from the 13th charge (which is at P). So the potential energy due to the interaction between the 13th and each of the 12 charges is important.

But also, the 12 charges are at 2m from P
