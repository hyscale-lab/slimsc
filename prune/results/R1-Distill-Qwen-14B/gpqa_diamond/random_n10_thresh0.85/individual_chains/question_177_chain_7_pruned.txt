Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again carefully.

The question is about the luminosities of two stars. Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than Star_2. Also, the mass of Star_1 is 1.5 times that of Star_2. The astronomers found that the wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest are the same. They also measured the radial velocities: Star_1 is 0 km/s, and Star_2 is 700 km/s. The question is asking by what factor Star_1's luminosity is greater than Star_2's, assuming they radiate as black bodies.

Hmm. I remember that the luminosity of a star depends on its radius and temperature. The formula I recall is the Stefan-Boltzmann law, which is L = 4πR²σT⁴. So L is proportional to R² times T^4, where σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant. So I need to find the temperatures of the two stars.

But wait, how? Oh, right, the peak wavelength where a black body emits most strongly is given by Wien's law: λ_max = b / T, where b is Wien's displacement constant (approximately 2.898×10^-3 m·K). So if both stars have the same λ_max, that must mean their temperatures are the same? Because λ_max is inversely proportional to T. Wait, but the problem says the wavelengths at which the stars appeared brightest are the same. So λ_1_max = λ_2_max, implying T_1 = T_2.

Wait a second, but then the velocities are given. How does that come into play? Oh right, the radial velocity relates to the Doppler shift, which affects the observed wavelength. So the star's emitted wavelength is shifted due to their motion towards or away from us.

So the observed wavelength is λ_observed = λ_emitted * sqrt( (1 + v_r) / (1 - v_r) ) ), approximately, when v_r is much less than the speed of light. But wait, that's the relativistic Doppler shift. Alternatively, for small velocities, it's roughly λ_obs ≈ λ_emitted (1 + v_r/c), but I'm not sure. Wait, the Doppler effect formula could be a bit tricky here.

Alternatively, the observed wavelength is λ_obs = λ * sqrt( (1 + v_r/c) / (1 - v_r/c) ), but if v_r is much less than c, this can be approximated as 1 + v_r/(2c) when v_r is small compared to c.

Wait, but in this problem, Star_1 has a radial velocity of 0, so its observed wavelength is the same as its emitted λ. Star_2 has a radial velocity of 700 km/s. Now, what's the speed of light in km/s? Approximately 3e5 km/s, so 700 is about 0.23% of c. So the approximation might be okay.

But wait, the problem says that the observed wavelengths are the same. So the emitted wavelengths are different, but due to Doppler shift, their observed wavelengths are the same. So let's think: both stars emit at their respective λ_max (based on their temperatures), but due to their velocities, their observed λ_max is the same.

Wait, no. Wait, the problem states that the wavelengths at which the stars appeared brightest are the same. So λ_obs_1 = λ_obs_2.

Star_1's radial velocity is zero, so λ_obs_1 = λ_emit_1. Star_2 has a radial velocity of 700 km/s. So what's the direction? If velocity is positive, is it moving away or towards? The problem just says radial velocity is 700 km/s, but I think in this context, typically, a positive radial velocity would mean moving away, causing a redshift.

Wait, but the exact formula is needed here. Let me think. The
