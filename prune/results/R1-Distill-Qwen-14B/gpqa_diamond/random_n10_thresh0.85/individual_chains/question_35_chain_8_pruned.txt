Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here about the Y-component of the intrinsic angular momentum operator for a muon. Hmm. Let me try to break this down step by step.

The question says that the operator A_y is represented by a 2x2 matrix, which is given as A_y = c * S. Oh wait, c is h/(4π), right? And S is another 2x2 matrix. The first row of S is (0, -i), and the second row is (i, 0). So S looks like this:

S = [ [0, -i],
       [i, 0] ]

So first, I need to find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of A_y. Let me think about how to find eigenvalues. The eigenvalues come from solving the characteristic equation det(A_y - a I) = 0, where a is the eigenvalue and I is the identity matrix.

But wait, A_y is c multiplied by S. So A_y = (h/(4π)) * S. Let me write out A_y explicitly.

A_y = [ [0, -i*(h/(4π))],
         [i*(h/(4π)), 0] ]

So the matrix is:

Row 1: 0, -(i h)/(4π)
Row 2: (i h)/(4π), 0

To find the eigenvalues, I need to compute the determinant of (A_y - a I) = 0.

So the matrix A_y - a I would be:

[ -a, -(i h)/(4π) ]
[ (i h)/(4π), -a ]

The determinant is (-a)(-a) - [ (i h/(4π)) * (-i h/(4π)) ) ] = 0.

Calculating each part:

First term: a².

Second term: multiply (i h/(4π)) by (-i h/(4π)).

Wait, (i)(-i) is (-i²) which is -(-1) = 1. So (i)(-i) =1. Then h/(4π) squared is (h²)/(16 π²). So that term becomes (h^2)/(16 π^2) * (i*(-i))= (h²/(16 π²)) * (1) )= h²/(16 π²).

So determinant equation: a² - [ (h²/(16 π²)) ] = 0.

So a² = h²/(16
