Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of these reaction mechanisms. Let me try to break it down step by step.

The starting material is 1,3-dibromoadamantane. I remember that adamantane is a diamondoid structure, so it's a pretty rigid molecule with a lot of bridgehead carbons. 1,3-dibromo would mean there are bromine atoms on two of these bridgehead positions.

The first reaction is heating with excess KOH at 240°C. KOH is a strong base, so I'm thinking elimination reaction, maybe dehydrohalogenation. Since there are two bromines, perhaps it's a double elimination. Wait, in such structures, when you have two adjacent leaving groups, elimination can lead to forming a double bond. But wait, adamantane is already a fused ring structure. Oh, wait, so maybe this is a Dieckmann elimination scenario, but that's for cyclic esters. Alternatively, since it's dibromo, perhaps it's a di-elimination to form an alkyne or an alkene.

Wait, but let's think about the product. The product when KOH is used on vicinal dihalides (like 1,2-dibromo) typically leads to alkenes via elimination. But here it's 1,3 positions, not 1,2. Hmm, so maybe the elimination isn't as straightforward. Oh wait, adamantane is a bridged structure. Maybe the two bromines are on adjacent bridgeheads, so when they eliminate, they form a bridgehead double bond. Oh, but bridgehead double bonds are generally not possible due to Bredt's Rule, which says that bridgehead positions can't have double bonds because of the ring strain. So that can't be right.

Wait, maybe it's not a double elimination forming a double bond. Alternatively, perhaps each elimination forms a single bond, but forms an alkene elsewhere. Or perhaps each Br is eliminated in a separate reaction, but that might not make sense for the structure.

Wait, another thought: when dealing with dihalides, especially in adamantane, heating with a strong base might lead to the formation of an epoxide. Wait, no, epoxide would require an oxide ion, but with KOH, maybe it's an elimination to form an ether or something else.

Wait, another possibility: maybe it's a double elimination to form an alkyne. Because if you have two bromides adjacent, you could lose two HBr molecules to form a triple bond. But wait, the product's IR shows an absorbance at 1720 cm⁻¹. That's a strong carbonyl (C=O) stretch, which suggests maybe a ketone or ester or something with a carbonyl group. Hmm, that doesn't fit with an alkyne.

Wait, the product after KOH is a light yellow solid. So maybe it's an epoxide? No, because the IR doesn't show the C-O stretch which is around 1250 cm⁻¹. Or maybe it's an elimination forming a carbonyl. How?

Wait, let's think about the structure of 1,3-dibromoadamantane. If the two bromines are on carbons 1 and 3 of the adamantane structure, perhaps when KOH is added, each Br leaves but in a way that forms a ketone or something similar. Oh wait, maybe it's dehydrohalogenation leading to a ketone. Wait, elimination of HBr would form a double bond, but if that's not possible, maybe it's a different kind of elimination.

Alternatively, perhaps each Br is replaced by an -OH group. Wait, no, KOH is a base, not a nucleophile in this case. Wait, no, if it's an E2 mechanism, the base abstracts a proton, leading to the formation of a double bond. But if the bridgehead can't support a double bond, maybe it's leading to a ring expansion or something else.

Wait, another approach: the NMR data might give me a clue. The product's 1H NMR has peaks at 4.79 (2H), 2.41-2.23 (10H), 1.94 (2H). The IR at 1720 cm⁻¹ suggests a carbonyl.

So the product after KOH is likely a ketone. How? Maybe the reaction is a double elimination where each Br is replaced by an oxygen group, but how?

Wait, another thought: maybe the base is promoting an elimination of two HBr molecules, forming a carbonyl group. For example, if each Br is on a position where elimination leads to a carbonyl. Wait, but how would that work? Let me think about a similar reaction.

Oh, wait, there's a reaction where dihalides can lose two X groups and form a ketone. For example, in the presence of a strong base, vicinal dihalides can undergo dehydrohalogenation twice to form a ketone. So, for example, if you have R-Br-CH2-Br-R', heating with KOH could lead to R-CO-R' after losing two HBr molecules. But in our case, the structure is 1,3-dibromoadamantane, so perhaps the elimination leads to a carbonyl group in the center.

Wait, if the two bromines are on adjacent carbons, but in a bridge structure, perhaps eliminating both would form a carbonyl. So, for 1,3-dibromoadamantane, eliminating two HBr would form an adamantanone, which would have a carbonyl group. That would fit the IR data, as a ketone has a strong C=O stretch around 1720 cm⁻¹.

So product 1 is 1,3-adamantanedione? Wait, no, because 1,3 positions are not adjacent. Hmm, maybe it's a bridged carbonyl. Alternatively, perhaps it's an endo-trig elimination, but I'm not sure.

Wait, let me imagine the structure. Adamantane is a diamondoid with four cyclohexane rings fused. 1,3-dibromoadamantane would have Br on two bridgeheads. When KOH is added, each Br might lose HBr, leading to the formation of a carbonyl group. So, perhaps the product after KOH is a ketone, called 1,3-adamantanedione? Or maybe 1,3-diketone. Alternatively, perhaps only one of the Br is eliminated, but that would not fit the NMR data.

Wait, the NMR shows a peak at 4.79 ppm (2H). That's probably an -OH or an -O- group, but the product is an acid? Let me think. A carbonyl group, maybe as a ketone, but the other peaks are around 2.2-2.4 ppm, which are typical for CH2 groups near electronegative atoms or in certain environments.

Wait, maybe the product is a diol. But the IR doesn't show O-H stretch (which is usually broad around 3300 cm⁻¹). Alternatively, maybe it's an epoxide, but then the IR would show C-O-C stretch around 1250 cm⁻¹. Hmm, but the IR is showing 1720, which definitely points to a carbonyl.

So perhaps product 1 is a ketone, and the NMR shows the carbonyl adjacent to some protons. Wait, the 4.79 ppm (2H) could be a methylene group (CH2) next to a carbonyl, maybe as a ketone. So perhaps it's something like an acetone group attached to the adamantane structure.

Wait, the structure of product 1: Let's say that the two Br atoms are on adjacent bridgehead carbons. When KOH is applied, each Br leaves, and two HBr molecules are eliminated, leading to the formation of a carbonyl group. So, the structure would be an adamantane with a carbonyl group in place of the two Br atoms. So the product would be 1,3-adamantanedione but that might not be possible due to the positions. Alternatively, maybe it's 1-adamantanone if it's a single ketone, but that would require only one Br elimination. Hmm, but the NMR shows 2H at 4.79, which might be a CH2 group next to a carbonyl.

Wait, perhaps the product is an ester or an ether, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe it's an epoxide. Wait, but no, the IR doesn't fit. Let me think again.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction isn't a double elimination but an SN2 reaction. But with two Br atoms, maybe each is replaced by a hydroxyl group. Wait, but in that case, the product would be a diol, but the IR doesn't show O-H stretches. So perhaps that's not it.

Wait, maybe I'm getting stuck here. Let me think about the
