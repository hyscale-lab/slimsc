Okay, so I've got this question about stars and their effective temperatures based on the excitation of iron atoms in their photospheres. Hmm, I remember from my studies that the excitation of atoms in a star's atmosphere is related to the temperature through something called the Boltzmann equation. Let me think about that.

The question states that the iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited as those in star_2 for a specific energy level. Oh wait, "twice as excited" probably refers to the number of atoms in that excited state being higher. So, the excitation level is higher in star_1.

I recall the Boltzmann distribution formula, which relates the number of particles in different energy states. The formula is something like n_i over n_j equals exp( -(E_i - E_j)/(k T) ), where k is Boltzmann's constant and T is the temperature. Since the energy difference between the two levels is given, E_i - E_j = delta E = 1.38e-23 J.

In this case, the excited state is higher, so E_i is higher than E_j. So for each star, the ratio of excited atoms (n_i) to ground state atoms (n_j) would be n_i/n_j = exp( -delta_E/(k T) ). 

Wait, but the question says that the excitation (n_i) in star_1 is twice that of star_2. So for each star, n_i relates to their own temperatures. Let me think about the ratio. Let's say for star 1, n1_i over n1_j = exp( -delta_E/(k T1) ), and for star 2, n2_i over n2_j = exp( -delta_E/(k T2) ).

But according to the problem, n1_i is twice n2_i. Or wait, no, the problem states that the atoms in star_1 are twice as excited. Wait, I think I might have misread that. The question says, "iron atoms in the photosphere of star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level when compared to star_2." So n1_i is 2 times n2_i? Or is it the ratio between their n_i and n_j that's different?

No, the way the problem is phrased: "twice as excited" probably means that (n_i)/n_j for star_1 is twice that of (n_i)/n_j for star_2. So let me write that out.

So, (n1_i / n1_j) = 2 * (n2_i / n2_j )

But using the Boltzmann factor, each of these is:

n_i/n_j = exp( - delta_E/(k T) )

So,

exp( - delta_E/(k T1) ) = 2 * exp( - delta_E/(k T2) )

Wait, that's because the ratio for star_1 is 2 times the ratio for star_2.

So taking the natural log of both sides:

- delta_E/(k T1) = ln(2) + [ - delta_E/(k T2) ]

Let me rearrange that.

Bring the delta_E/(k T2) to the left and the others to the right:

delta_E/(k T2) - delta_E/(k T1) = ln(2)

Factor out delta_E/(k):

delta_E/(k) [ 1/T2 - 1/T1 ] = ln(2)

Hmm, so:

(delta_E / (k)) [ (T1 - T2) / (T1 T2) ) ] = ln(2)

Wait, because 1/T2 - 1/T1 is (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2). Let me confirm that: 1/T2 -1/T1 = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2). Yes, that's right.

So then,

(delta_E / k) * (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) ) = ln(2)

But the question asks for an equation in terms of T1 and T2. The delta_E is given, but the options don't include any constants. So perhaps we can rearrange to solve for T1 and T2.

Wait, what's delta_E? The energy difference is given as 1.38e-23 J. But that's a specific value, and in the equation, it's multiplied by (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2). However, the options don't have any numbers, so perhaps the equation can be written in terms that eliminate delta_E.

Wait, but the options don't have any variables except T1 and T2. So perhaps the equation is written as:

ln(2) = (delta_E / k) * (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) )

But the options don't include delta_E or k, so perhaps I need to rearrange the equation without knowing the constants.

Wait, maybe the question is set up in a way that the equation can be written without the delta_E. Because without knowing the exact value, perhaps the ratio (delta_E/(k)) is something that can be represented in terms of T1 and T2.

Wait, no. Let me think again. I have:

ln(2) = [ delta_E/(k) ] * (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2 )

But the options don't have delta_E
