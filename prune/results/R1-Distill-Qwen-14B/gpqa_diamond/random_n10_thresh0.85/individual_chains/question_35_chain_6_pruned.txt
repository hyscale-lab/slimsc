Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem about the Y-component of the intrinsic angular momentum operator for a muon. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through.

The problem says that Ay is a 2x2 matrix operator represented as c·S, where c is h/(4π) and S is another 2x2 matrix. The S matrix has the first row as (0 -i) and the second row as (i 0). Oh wait, I remember that S here might be related to the Pauli matrices, but scaled somehow.

I need to find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of Ay. So, let's start by writing down what Ay looks like. Since Ay = c·S, and c is h/(4π), let's compute S first. 

Wait, the matrix S is given as:
[ 0   -i ]
[ i    0 ]

So, S is actually the Pauli Y matrix. Oh right, the Pauli matrices are σx, σy, σz. The Y Pauli matrix is exactly this. So S = σy.

So, then Ay = c * σy. And c is h/(4π). So, substituting, Ay = (h/(4π)) * [[0, -i], [i, 0]].

Wait, let's compute that matrix. Multiplying each element by h/(4π):

Ay = [ [0, (-i)(h/(4π))], 
       [i*(h/(4π)), 0] ]

Which simplifies to:

[ 0, (-i h)/(4π) ]
[ (i h)/(4π), 0 ]

Now, to find the eigenvalues of Ay, I'll need to solve the characteristic equation det(Ay - a I) = 0, where a is the eigenvalue.

The matrix (Ay - a I) is:

[ -a, (-i h)/(4π) ]
[ (i h)/(4π), -a ]

The determinant is (-a)(-a) - [ (-i h)/(4π) * (i h)/(4π) ]

So determinant = a² - [ (-i)(i) * (h²)/(16 π²) ] 

Wait, let's compute that term. (-i)(i) = -i² = -(-1) = 1. So the second term is (1)*(h²)/(16 π²). So determinant becomes a² - (h²
