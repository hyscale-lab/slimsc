Okay, so I've got this question about stars and which ones can be detected by two different spectrographs: ESPRESSO at Paranal and HIRES at Keck. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my astronomy, but let's think this through.

First, the question gives some details about each spectrograph's brightness limit. ESPRESSO can observe stars brighter than V magnitude 17. HIRES can handle up to 16 V mag. Oh wait, wait, actually, I think I need to clarify that. The question says, "stars with apparent V magnitudes brighter than 17 mag can be observed," but wait, magnitudes are a bit tricky. Because lower magnitude means brighter, right? So a star that is brighter than 17 mag is actually dimmer than a star at magnitude 17. Because the scale is inverted. So, for example, a magnitude 1 star is brighter than a magnitude 2 star.

Wait, no, wait. Let me get this straight. The magnitude scale is such that lower numbers mean brighter objects. So when the question says ESPRESSO can observe stars with V magnitudes brighter than 17 mag, that means they have a V mag less than 17. Because 'brighter than 17' would be magnitudes like 16, 15, etc. Oh, I think I got that mixed up earlier. So the limit is, ESPRESSO can go down to 17 (so can observe stars as bright as 17 or brighter, which are lower magnitudes) and HIRES can go down to 16. So HIRES can observe brighter stars than ESPRESSO, because 16 is brighter than 17. Wait, no. Wait, wait, no. Because a lower magnitude number is brighter. So a star that is magnitude 16 is brighter than 17. So HIRES can observe stars with apparent V mag up to 16, meaning brighter than 16. So a star with V mag 16.5 is fainter than 16, so can't be seen by HIRES. But ESPRESSO can go up to 17. So stars with V mag up to 17 can be detected by ESPRESSO.

Wait, the question says: "stars with apparent V magnitudes brighter than 17 mag can be observed, while with HIRES, stars brighter than 16 V mag can be observed." Wait, that's confusing. Let me parse this.
