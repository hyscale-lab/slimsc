Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. I need to figure out which compound E is formed based on the reaction sequence given. Hmm, let me think this through step by step.

Alright, the problem gives me a series of reactions starting from compound A and going through several steps to form compound E. Plus, there are some hints, so I should definitely use those to help me out.

First, let me list out the reactions:

1. Compound A reacts with HCN to form compound B.
2. Compound B is reduced with H2 in the presence of Pd to form compound C.
3. Compound C reacts with HNO2 to form compound D.
4. Compound D eliminates an inert gas to form compound E.

And the hints are:

a) Compound A, when reacted with an unknown phosphorous ylide, forms 1,2-dimethyl-4-(propan-2-ylidene)cyclopentane.
b) The IR of A has a strong peak around 1750 cm^-1, while E's IR is around 1715 cm^-1.

The options are A to D, each a different cyclic ketone.

Okay, let's break this down.

Starting with hint b: IR peaks. The strong peak at 1750 cm^-1 in A suggests a carbonyl group, maybe a ketone or an aldehyde. But since the next step is reacting with HCN, which usually adds to carbonyl groups, A is likely a ketone. So, A is a cyclic ketone.

The IR of E is 1715 cm^-1. That's also a carbonyl, but maybe a different environment. Could be a ketone or maybe an ester, but given the reactions, probably a ketone still.

Now, hint a: A reacts with a phosphorous ylide to form 1,2-dimethyl-4-(propan-2-ylidene)cyclopentane. Hmm, wait, phosphorous ylides are typically used in Wittig reactions. The Wittig reaction converts aldehydes or ketones into alkenes. But wait, A is a ketone, right? So the ylide would react with the carbonyl group.

Wait, but the product is 1,2-dimethyl-4-(propan-2-ylidene)cyclopentane. Propan-2-ylidene is like CH2=C(CH3)-.

So the product is a cyclopentane with substituents. Let me draw that. The cyclopentane ring has substituents at positions 1 and 2 as methyl groups, and at position 4 is a propan-2-ylidene group, which is a substituent with a double bond. Wait, but in the Wittig reaction, the ylide adds to the carbonyl to form a double bond. So, maybe A is a cyclopentanone, and the Wittig forms an alkene.

Wait, let's think. Suppose compound A is cyclopentanone. When
