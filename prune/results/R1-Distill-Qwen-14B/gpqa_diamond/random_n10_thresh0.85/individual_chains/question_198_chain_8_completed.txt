Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me try to think it through.

Hmm, the question is about the percentage of blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes in a solution. The solution contains Co(II) ions and thiocyanate. The concentrations are given: c(Co) is 1e-2 M and [SCN-] is 0.1 M. The stability constants (beta) for the complexes are β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, and β4=16. Wait, wait, stability constants are usually for each step of complex formation, right? So, β1 is for the first complex, maybe Co(SCN)1, β2 for the second, Co(SCN)2, and so on.

The question is asking about the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato complexes. Dithiocyanato would mean two SCN- ligands. So that would be either the Co(SCN)_2 complex or maybe even Co(SCN)_3? Wait, I'm a bit confused. Oh, right, the blue complexes are typically the ones with more SCN- ligands. Like, maybe Co(SCN)_2^2+ is the blue one, but I'm not entirely sure. Wait, the options given include 38.1%, which I think is the standard percentage for the blue complex when considering the third or second complex. But I need to think carefully.

Wait, the stability constants are given as β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16. Wait, that seems a bit odd. Normally, stability constants increase with each complex as you add more ligands, but here β4 is lower than β3. Maybe they aren't following that trend. Hmm.

So, the problem is about speciation—calculating the distribution of all possible complexes and free ions. The total cobalt concentration includes all species: Co²+, CoSCN^+, Co(SCN)_2^2+, Co(SCN)_3^3+, Co(SCN)_4^4+. So, the sum of all these concentrations equals c(Co) = 1e-2 M.

The stability constant for each step is the formation of each complex. So:

β1 = [Co(SCN)]+ / ( [Co²+][SCN-] )
β2 = [Co(SCN)_2^2+]/( [Co(SCN)]+ [SCN-] )
β3 = [Co(SCN)_3^3+]/( [Co(SCN)_2^2+][SCN-] )
β4 = [Co(SCN)_4^4+]/( [Co(SCN)_3^3+][SCN-] )

The way these work is that each subsequent step's stability constant affects the ratio of each complex to the next.

But I need to find the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato complex. I'm assuming that the blue complex is Co(SCN)_2^2+ because I remember that in the case of Co with thiocyanate, the blue color comes from the [Co(SCN)_2]^(2+) complex. Or wait, maybe it's the Co(SCN)_3^- complex? No, wait, I think the blue one is the [Co(SCN)_2]^2+ ion. Let me think again. I think that the [Co(SCN)_4]^2- is actually the pink one, and the blue is [Co(SCN)_2]^2+ or [Co(SCN)_3]^-. Hmm, perhaps I should double-check. Alternatively, maybe the problem states which complex is blue, but the question doesn't specify. Since the question refers to dithiocyanato, which means two SCN- groups, so it must be the Co(SCN)_2^2+ complex.

So, the question is: what is the percentage of Co(SCN)_2^2+ among all Co species?

To find this, I think I need to compute the concentration of each complex and free ion, then find the ratio of [Co(SCN)_2^2+] to the total.

The approach I remember is to set up the fractions of each species based on the stability constants. For a series of complexes, the fraction of each can be found using the cumulative beta values and considering the reaction quotient.

Alternatively, I can model the species distribution using the given stability constants. Since the ligand (SCN-) concentration is much higher than the Co concentration, the solution will tend to form the most stable complexes possible.

Wait, the thiocyanate concentration is 0.1 M, which is 10 times higher than 1e-2 M for Co. So, the ligand is in excess, so the Co will form as many complexes as possible. So, the highest stability constant is β3=63. But wait, β4 is 16, which is lower than β3. That might mean that the third complex is more stable than the fourth. So, the most abundant species would be the third complex, perhaps.

Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me think about how to model this.

The general approach is to consider the species distribution in a solution with a metal ion and a ligand. Each step of complexation can be represented with a stability constant. The fraction of each species can be calculated using the cumulative product of the previous betas and the ligand concentration.

But wait, the exact formula for each species' fraction is given by:

f_n = (β_n / (1 + β1[SCN] + β1β2[SCN]^2 + β1β2β3[SCN]^3 + ... + (β1β2...βn)[SCN]^n )) )

Wait, no, that's not quite right. Maybe each f_n is (β1β2...βn [SCN]^n ) / (denominator), where denominator is sum of all possible terms up to the highest possible complex.

Wait, another approach is to express each species as a function of the free [Co²+]. Let me denote [Co²+] as x. Then, the concentration of each complex can be expressed in terms of x and the ligand concentration.

So, [CoSCN^+] = β1 x [SCN] = 9 * x * 0.1 = 0.9 x.

[Co(SCN)_2^2+] = β2 [CoSCN^+] [SCN] = β2 * (β1 x [SCN]) ) * [SCN] = β1 β2 x [SCN]^2 = 9 *40 x (0.1)^2 = 360 x * 0.01 = 3.6 x.

Wait, wait, let me correct that.

Wait, [Co(SCN)_2^2+] = β2 [Co(SCN)]+ [SCN-] = β2 * (β1 [Co²+][SCN-]) ) * [SCN-] = β1 β2 [Co²+][SCN-]^2.

Similarly,

[Co(SCN)_3^3+] = β3 [Co(SCN)_2^2+] [SCN-] = β3 * β2 β1 [Co²+][SCN]^3.

And [Co(SCN)_4^4+] = β4 [Co(SCN)_3^3+] [SCN-] = β4 β3 β2 β1 [Co²+][SCN]^4.

So, all species can be expressed in terms of [Co²+] = x.

So, the concentrations are:

[Co²+] = x

[CoSCN+] = β1 x [SCN] = 9 x (0.1) = 0.9 x.

[Co(SCN)_2^2+] = β1 β2 x [SCN]^2 = 9 * 40 * x * (0.1)^2 = 360 x * 0.01 = 3.6 x.

Wait, wait, 9 *40 is 360. 0.1 squared is 0.01. 360 * 0.01 is 3.6. So, [Co(SCN)_2^2+] is 3.6 x.

[Co(SCN)_3^3+] = β1 β2 β3 x [SCN]^3 = 9*40*63 x (0.1)^3 = 9*40=360; 360*63=22680. 22680 * x * 0.001 = 22.68 x.

[Co(SCN)_4^4+] = β1 β2 β3 β4 x [SCN]^4 = 9*40*63*16 x (0.1)^4.

Calculating that: 9*40=360, 360*63=22680, 22680*16=362880. (0.1)^4=1e-4. So 362880 * 1e-4 =36.288. So [Co(SCN)_4^4+] = 36.288 x.

Wait, but wait, that seems like a lot. Let me check.

Wait, β4 is 16. So, β1 β2 β3 β4 = 9 *40=360; *63=22680; *16=362880.

Then, [Co(SCN)_4^4+] = 362880 x * (0.1)^4 = 362880 * 0.0001 x = 36.288 x.

Hmm, but the Co concentration is 1e-2 M, so total Co is x + 0.9x +3.6x +22.68x +36.288x = sum of all these terms.

So, sum is x*(1 +0.9 +3.6 +22.68 +36.288 ) = x * ( 1 + 0.9=1.9; 1.9+3.6=5.5; 5.5+22.68=28.18; 28.18+36.288=64.468 )

So, 64.468 x = c(Co) = 1e-2 M.

So, x = (1e-2) / 64.468 ≈ 1.5517e-4 M.

So, [Co²+] is about 1.5517e-4 M.

Now, let me calculate each species' concentration:

[Co²+] = x = 1.5517e-4.

[CoSCN+] = 0.9 x = 0.9 *1.5517e-4 ≈ 1.3965e-4.

[Co(SCN)_2^2+] =3.6 x ≈ 3.6 *1.5517e-4 ≈5.586e-4.

[Co(SCN)_3^3+] =22.68 x ≈22.68 *1.5517e-4 ≈3.523e-3.

[Co(SCN)_4^4+] =36.288 x ≈36.288 *1.5517e-4 ≈5.635e-3.

Wait, adding these up: 1.55e-4 + 1.396e-4 =3.0e-4; plus 5.586e-4 is 8.586e-4; plus 3.523e-3 is ~4.38e-3; plus 5.635e-3 is ~9.99e-3. Wait, but the total should be 1e-2 M, right?

Wait, let me sum all the concentrations:

1.5517e-4 (Co²+) 
+1.3965e-4 (CoSCN^+) 
= 3.00e-4.

+5.586e-4 ([Co(SCN)_2^2+]) = 8.586e-4.

+3.523e-3 ([Co(SCN)_3^3+]) = 4.38e-3.

+5.635e-3 ([Co(SCN)_4^4+]) = ~1.0015e-2.

Which is approximately 1e-2 M. That makes sense.

So, the question is asking for the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato complex, which I'm assuming is [Co(SCN)_2^2+], which has a concentration of ~5.586e-4 M.

So, the percentage is (5.586e-4 / 1e-2) * 100% = (5.586e-4 / 0.01) *100 = 5.586%.

Wait, that's only 5.586%. But looking at the options, the choices are 42%, 25%, 38%, 16%. Hmm, none of these match. Did I make a mistake?

Wait, maybe I got the wrong assumption about which complex is blue. Perhaps the blue complex is the [Co(SCN)_3]^−, which is [Co(SCN)_3^3-]?

Wait, but in my calculation, the [Co(SCN)_3^3+] is 3.523e-3 M, which is about 3.52e-3 / 0.01 = ~35.2% of the total. That's close to option C) 38.1%.

Wait, but why would the blue complex be [Co(SCN)_3^3+]?

Alternatively, I might have miscalculated. Let me check my steps again.

Wait, in the calculation, [CoSCN+] is 1.3965e-4, [Co(SCN)_2^2+] is 5.586e-4, [Co(SCN)_3^3+] is 3.523e-3, and [Co(SCN)_4^4+] is 5.635e-3.

So, [Co(SCN)_3^3+] is 3.523e-3, which is 35.23% of the total (since total is 0.01 M). So, 3.523e-3 is 35.23% of 0.01, because 3.523e-3 / 0.01 = 0.3523, which is 35.23%.

So if the blue complex is [Co(SCN)_3^3+], the percentage is about 35.2%, which is close to option C) 38.1%. Hmm, but not exactly. Did I make a mistake in calculation?

Alternatively, perhaps I messed up the ligand concentration in any step. Let me recalculate the concentrations.

Wait, SCN- concentration is 0.1 M, which is 1e-1 M.

Wait, another approach is to calculate the fraction of each species.

Let me denote y = [SCN-] = 0.1 M.

The fraction of each species is given by:

f_n = (β1 β2 ... βn y^n) / (1 + β1 y + β1 β2 y^2 + β1 β2 β3 y^3 + ... + β1 β2 β3 β4 y^4 )

So, for each species, n=0 is Co²+, n=1 is CoSCN^+, etc.

So, calculate each term in the denominator:

Term n=0: 1.

n=1: β1 y =9 *0.1=0.9.

n=2: β1 β2 y^2 =9 *40 * (0.1)^2 = 360 * 0.01 =3.6.

n=3: β1 β2 β3 y^3=9*40*63 * (0.1)^3= (9*40=360, 360*63=22680) * 0.001=22.68.

n=4: β1 β2 β3 β4 y^4=9*40*63*16 * (0.1)^4= (9*40=360; 360*63=22680; 22680*16=362880) * 0.0001=36.288.

So, denominator sum is 1 +0.9 +3.6 +22.68 +36.288 = 64.468.

So, the fractions are:

f0 = 1 /64.468 ≈ 0.015517 → [Co²+] is 1.5517e-2 * 0.015517? Wait, no. Wait, the fractions are:

f0 = 1 /64.468 ≈0.015517 → Co²+ is 0.015517 of the total.

f1 =0.9 /64.468 ≈0.01397 → CoSCN^+ is 0.01397.

f2=3.6 /64.468 ≈0.05586 → Co(SCN)_2^2+ is 5.586%.

f3=22.68 /64.468 ≈0.3518 → Co(SCN)_3^3+ is 35.18%.

f4=36.288 /64.468 ≈0.5629 → Co(SCN)_4^4+ is 56.29%.

Wait, that doesn't add up. 1.55% (f0) + 1.397% (f1) +5.586% (f2) +35.18% (f3) +56.29% (f4) = about 100% (1.55+1.4=2.95; +5.58=8.53; +35.18=43.71; +56.29=99.999%—so approx 100%).

So the largest fraction is the [Co(SCN)_4^4+] at ~56%, then [Co(SCN)_3^3+] at 35%, then [Co(SCN)_2^2+] at 5.5%, and so on.

Wait, but according to the fractions, the [Co(SCN)_3^3+] is about 35.18% of all species. That's close to option C) 38.1%, but not exactly.

Wait, but maybe I have a mistake in β4. The last β is 16, but when calculating β1β2β3β4, it's 9*40*63*16= 9*40=360; 360*63=22680; 22680*16=362,880. So that's correct.

But wait, another thought: perhaps the dithiocyanato complex is the [Co(SCN)_2]^2+ (n=2), which is 5.586% of the total, but that's not an option. None of the options are around 5.5%. The options start at 16.9%, so that can't be. So, perhaps I made a mistake in assuming which complex the question refers to.

Wait, the question says "blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes". Dithiocyanato would be two SCN groups, so [Co(SCN)_2]^2+ is the correct species. But according to the fractions, that's only about 5.586%, which is not among the options.

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me recheck the fractions.

Wait, the denominator is 64.468, correct.

f2=3.6/64.468 = 3.6 /64.468 ≈0.05586, which is 5.586%.

But the options don't have this. The closest is D) 16.9%, which is about 17%, which is higher than 5.5%.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the β's. Oh wait, wait a second. The stability constants given are β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16. But sometimes, the stability constants are given as the overall constant for the nth complex, which is the product of all previous β's. So, perhaps I got the order wrong.

Wait, no. The β's are for each step. So, β1 is for the first complex, which is CoSCN^+, β2 is for the second, Co(SCN)_2^2+, and so on.

Wait, but another possibility: perhaps the stability constants are given in reverse. Like, β1 is the overall constant for the first complex, β2 is for the second, etc. But no, that's the usual way.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the ligand concentration is 0.1 M, but when calculating the terms, it's [SCN]^n, so for (0.1)^n.

Wait, let me recalculate the denominator:

n=0: 1 → 1.

n=1: β1 * y =9 *0.1=0.9 →0.9.

n=2: β1 β2 y^2=9 *40 * (0.1)^2 →9*40=360, 0.1^2=0.01 →360 *0.01=3.6.

n=3: β1 β2 β3 y^3=9*40*63 * (0.1)^3 →9*40=360, 360*63=22680, (0.1)^3=0.001 →22680 *0.001=22.68.

n=4: β1 β2 β3 β4 y^4=9*40*63*16 * (0.1)^4 →9*40=360, *63=22680, *16=362880, (0.1)^4=0.0001 →362880 *0.0001=36.288.

So the sum is 1 +0.9=1.9 +3.6=5.5 +22.68=28.18 +36.288=64.468.

So back to the fractions:

f3=22.68 /64.468 =0.3518 →35.18%.

But wait, the options don't have 35.18%, but option C is 38.1%. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the stability constants. Wait, the problem says the stability constants are β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16. Oh wait, hold on. Wait, maybe the order is different. Because sometimes β1 is the first, but maybe β4 is the overall constant for the fourth complex. So, perhaps the product is up to βn for the nth complex.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the stability constants are given as:

β1 = [CoSCN+]/([Co²+][SCN-]) →9.

β2 = [Co(SCN)_2^2+]/([CoSCN+][SCN-]) →40.

β3 = [Co(SCN)_3^3+]/([Co(SCN)_2^2+][SCN-}) →63.

β4 = [Co(SCN)_4^4+]/([Co(SCN)_3^3+][SCN-}) →16.

So, the way I did the calculation is correct.

Wait, perhaps the question is about the dithiocyanato, which is two SCN-, but the Co is in a +2 oxidation state. So, the charge would be 2+ for the complex. So, that's [Co(SCN)_2]^2+.

So, according to the fractions, that's 5.586% of the total. But the options don't include this.

Wait, perhaps I have to consider that the blue complex is the [Co(SCN)_3]^− ion, which is the third complex. But wait, in that case, the charge would be (Co^2+ + 3*(-) SCN) → Co(SCN)_3^-.

But in the problem statement, it's cobalt(II), so the overall charge would be Co^2+ plus 3 SCN^- gives [Co(SCN)_3]^2-? Or maybe [Co(SCN)_3]^-.

Wait, but regardless, the fraction for that species is 35.18%, which is close to 35%, but the options don't have that. The closest option is C) 38.1%. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I'm supposed to calculate the concentration of [Co(SCN)_2]^2+ and [Co(SCN)_3]^3+ together, because they're both dithiocyanato or something. Wait, no, that doesn't make sense.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the fractions. Let me recheck.

Wait, another thought: maybe the stability constants are given as the overall constants for each complex, not stepwise. Wait, no, the question says "stability constants of the cobalt(II) thiocyanato complexes are β1=9, β2=40, β3=63 and β4=16." So, β1 is for the first complex, β2 for the second, etc.

Alternatively, perhaps the calculation should stop at the third complex because that's the most stable, but with β4=16 being less than β3=63, so perhaps the third complex is more stable than the fourth, so the fourth isn't formed as much.

But in the denominator, we included all terms up to n=4, because the model assumes all possible complexes are formed.

Wait, maybe the problem is that the fourth complex isn't actually formed because β4 is lower. But in the calculation, we included all possible terms. Hmm, but the model assumes that all steps are possible, so even if the last step has a lower beta, it's still considered.

Alternatively, perhaps the answer is the sum of the fractions for [Co(SCN)_2^2+] and [Co(SCN)_3^3+], but that would be 5.586% +35.18% =40.766%, which is ~40.8% of the total. The options have A)42.3%, which is close. Hmm.

Wait, but why would we sum these two? Because both are dithiocyanato? No, [Co(SCN)_2] is dithiocyanato, [Co(SCN)_3] is trithiocyanato. So, the question is only about the blue dithiocyanato, which is [Co(SCN)_2]^2+.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the order of the complexes. Maybe the blue complex is [Co(SCN)_3]^−. In that case, its fraction is 35.18%, which would be close to 35%—but no option is exactly that. The closest option is C) 38.1%.

Wait, but where does 38.1% come from? Let me think about another approach.

Alternatively, perhaps the stability constants are arranged in a different order. For example, β1 could be for the fourth complex, β2 for the third, etc. But that would make the denominator sum different.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use the cumulative formation constants.

Wait, another approach is to find the fraction of each species with n=2 (dithiocyanato, which is [Co(SCN)_2]^2+), which is 5.586%. Since that's not an option, perhaps the problem is misstated, or I made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps I've misapplied the stability constants. Let me think again.

The stability constant for the first complex, [CoSCN]^+, is β1 =9.

For the second, [Co(SCN)_2]^2+, β2=40.

Wait, the overall formation constant for [Co(SCN)_2]^2+ would be β1 * β2 = 9 *40=360.

Similarly, for [Co(SCN)_3]^3+, it's β1*β2*β3=9*40*63=22680.

For [Co(SCN)_4]^4+, it's β1β2β3β4=9*40*63*16=362880.

So, the formation constants for each complex are:

K1 = β1 =9.

K2=β1β2=360.

K3=β1β2β3=22680.

K4=β1β2β3β4=362880.

So, the fraction of each species can be calculated using these K values.

The general formula for the fraction of species with n ligands is:

f_n = (K_n [SCN]^n) / (1 + K1 [SCN] + K2 [SCN]^2 + K3 [SCN]^3 + K4 [SCN]^4 )

Wait, wait, K_n is the overall formation constant for the nth complex. So, the denominator would be sum over all possible species.

So, let's compute each term:

[SCN] =0.1 M.

K1=9 → term for n=1: K1 [SCN] =9 *0.1=0.9.

K2=360 → term for n=2: K2 [SCN]^2=360*(0.1)^2=360 *0.01=3.6.

K3=22680 → term for n=3:22680*(0.1)^3=22680 *0.001=22.68.

K4=362880 → term for n=4:362880*(0.1)^4=362880 *0.0001=36.288.

So, the denominator is 1 +0.9 +3.6 +22.68 +36.288 =64.468.

f2= K2 [SCN]^2 / denominator =3.6 /64.468 ≈0.05586 →5.586%.

But that's not one of the options. So, this approach is leading me back to the same result.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is asking about the percentage of all thiocyanato complexes relative to the total cobalt, which includes all species. But that's not the case because the question specifically asks for dithiocyanato complexes, which is only [Co(SCN)_2]^2+.

Wait, maybe the mistake is in the calculation of the fractions. Let me recompute each fraction.

Denominator: 64.468.

n=0:1 → f0=1/64.468 ≈0.015517 →1.5517%.

n=1:0.9 → f1=0.9/64.468 ≈0.01397 →1.397%.

n=2:3.6 → f2=3.6/64.468≈0.05586 →5.586%.

n=3:22.68 →f3=22.68/64.468≈0.3518 →35.18%.

n=4:36.288 →f4=36.288/64.468≈0.5629 →56.29%.

So, adding up: 1.55% +1.4% =2.95% +5.586=8.536% +35.18=43.716% +56.29=99.999% (approx 100%).

So, the [Co(SCN)_2]^2+ is 5.586%, which is about 5.59%, but the options don't have that. So perhaps the question refers to another complex.

Wait, perhaps the dithiocyanato refers to the [Co(SCN)_2]^2+ and [Co(SCN)_3]^3+? No, that's not correct because dithiocyanato implies two SCN groups.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the problem is using the logarithm of the stability constants, but no, the problem states they're given as β1=9, etc., so that's not it.

Alternatively, perhaps I should calculate the concentration of [Co(SCN)_3]^3+ and [Co(SCN)_4]^4+ but that's not what the question is asking.

Wait, the question says "the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes". Blue is often associated with the [Co(SCN)_4]^2− complex, but I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, another possibility is that the blue color comes from [Co(SCN)_3]^−, which is a [Co^2+ (SCN)_3]^2− complex. Wait, but in that case, the charge would be (2+) +3*(-1) = -1, but that would be [Co(SCN)_3]^−.

But in my calculation, [Co(SCN)_3^3+] is 3.523e-3 M, which is 35.18% of the total.

Hmm, if the blue complex is [Co(SCN)_3]^3+, then the answer is 35.18%, but the options don't have that. The closest is option C)38.1%, which is about 38%, which is close to 35%.

Alternatively, perhaps the question has a typo and the β4 is 63, making the denominator terms different.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that the given β4 is 16, which is lower than β3=63. So, perhaps the fourth complex is less stable, meaning that the third complex is the most abundant.

Wait, but according to the fractions, the fourth complex ([Co(SCN)_4]^4+) is the most abundant at 56.29%, followed by the third complex at 35.18%.

So, perhaps the blue complex is the fourth complex? But I thought the blue was the second complex. But perhaps I'm mistaken.

If the blue complex is [Co(SCN)_4]^4+, then the fraction is 56.29%, which is not an option either.

Wait, perhaps I need to think of the possible ligand-to-metal ratio. The question says "dithiocyanato", which is two SCN- per Co. So, the [Co(SCN)_2]^2+ is the correct species.

But according to calculations, it's 5.586%. Then why is that not an option?

Alternatively, perhaps the question is about the percentage of all dithiocyanato complexes, which would include any with two SCN. But in that case, [Co(SCN)_2]^2+ is the only dithiocyanato complex, so it's 5.586%.

Wait, perhaps the question refers to the sum of the first and second complexes because 'dithiocyanato' could mean any complex with at least two SCN groups? No, that doesn't make sense.

Another possibility: perhaps the problem uses the formula where the fraction is calculated as (β1*β2)/(β1*β2*β3 + ...) ?

Wait, perhaps using the formula for the distribution of the nth species:

f_n = (β1 β2 ... βn [SCN]^n) / sum from k=0 to 4 (β1 β2 ... βk [SCN]^k )

Which is what I did earlier.

So, perhaps the question is incorrect, or I'm making a mistake.

Wait, perhaps the problem is not considering the [SCN]^n correctly. Wait, [SCN-] is 0.1 M, but when calculating [SCN]^n, it's (0.1)^n.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the calculation should be done in terms of the total concentration, and using the fractions as a ratio of the total.

Wait, perhaps the issue is the way I calculated the fractions. Let me think again.

The denominator is 64.468.

The fraction for [Co(SCN)_2]^2+ is 3.6 /64.468 ≈5.586%.

But the options don't have this. So, perhaps the correct answer isn't among the options, but that can't be. Alternatively, I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate the concentration of [Co(SCN)_2] considering only up to the third complex, ignoring the fourth. Because the fourth complex has a lower stability constant, maybe it's negligible. Let's see.

If I exclude the fourth complex, the denominator becomes 1 +0.9 +3.6 +22.68 =27.58.

Then, [Co(SCN)_2]^2+ fraction is 3.6/27.58≈0.1306 →13.06%.

Still not matching any options.

Wait, perhaps another approach. Maybe the problem is using the total concentration of all species except the free [Co²+], but that's not the case.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is asking for the sum of all dithiocyanato complexes beyond a certain point. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps I should re-express the problem using the formula:

The fraction of [Co(SCN)_2]^2+ is (β1 β2 [SCN]^2) / (1 + β1 [SCN] + β1 β2 [SCN]^2 + β1 β2 β3 [SCN]^3 + ... )

Wait, but that's what I did earlier.

I'm stuck. The calculated fraction for [Co(SCN)_2]^2+ is about 5.586%, which isn't among the options. So perhaps I made a mistake in the initial assumption about the β's.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the stability constants are given in reverse order. Like β1 is for the fourth complex, β2 for the third, β3 for the second, and β4 for the first. But that seems unlikely.

If that were the case, let's try:

β1=16 (so for [Co(SCN)_4]^4+).

β2=63 (for [Co(SCN)_3]^3+).

β3=40 (for [Co(SCN)_2]^2+).

β4=9 (for [CoSCN]^+).

But that would change the calculation.

Wait, but in that scenario, the denominator would have terms:

n=0:1.

n=1: β1=16 * [SCN]=16*0.1=1.6.

n=2:β1β2=16*63=1008 * (0.1)^2=1008 * 0.01=10.08.

n=3:β1β2β3=16*63*40=30240 * (0.1)^3=30240 * 0.001=30.24.

n=4:β1β2β3β4=16*63*40*9= 362880 * (0.1)^4=36.288.

So the denominator sum is 1 +1.6=2.6 +10.08=12.68 +30.24=42.92 +36.288=79.208.

Then,

f2=10.08 /79.208≈0.1272 →12.72%.

Still not matching the options.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the Co(SCN)_3^- complex as the blue one, which would have a fraction of 30.24/79.208=0.382 →38.2%, which is approximately option C)38.1%.

Ah! So, if the stability constants are arranged in reverse order, then the fraction for n=3 would be about 38.2%, matching option C.

But this would require that the first stability constant β1=16 corresponds to the fourth complex, which doesn't make sense because the problem states β1=9. So, perhaps the initial assumption about the order is wrong.

Wait, but the problem states β1=9, so the order can't be reversed. Therefore, I think I must have made a mistake in the initial approach.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using the β values as the cumulative constants, not stepwise. So, β1 is the overall constant for [CoSCN]^+, β2 is for [Co(SCN)_2]^2+, etc. So, in that case:

K1 = β1 =9.

K2 = β2=40.

K3=β3=63.

K4=β4=16.

But that doesn't make sense because K4 would be less than K3, which is unusual. But let's proceed.

The denominator would be 1 + K1 [SCN] + K2 [SCN]^2 + K3 [SCN]^3 + K4 [SCN]^4.

Wait, but K4=16, which is lower than K3=63.

So,

denominator =1 +9*0.1 +40*(0.1)^2 +63*(0.1)^3 +16*(0.1)^4.

Compute each term:

1 →1.

9*0.1=0.9.

40*(0.01)=0.4.

63*(0.001)=0.063.

16*(0.0001)=0.0016.

Sum:1 +0.9=1.9 +0.4=2.3 +0.063=2.363 +0.0016=2.3646.

So, denominator=2.3646.

f2=K2 [SCN]^2 / denominator =40 *0.01 =0.4 /2.3646≈0.169 →16.9%, which is option D.

But why would the stability constants be given as K1=9, K2=40, K3=63, K4=16? That would mean that the fourth complex is less stable than the third, which is possible, but the problem refers to the stability constants of the individual complexes, which are usually stepwise.

So, if the problem uses the β's as the cumulative stability constants, then the calculation would yield [CoSCN_2]^2+ fraction as 16.9%, which is option D.

But wait, the problem says 'stability constants of the cobalt(II) thiocyanato complexes are β1=9, β2=40, β3=63 and β4=16.' So, what does that mean? Stability constants can be either stepwise or overall. Stepwise would be the way I originally calculated.

But if the problem is using the overall stability constants, then K1=9, K2=40, K3=63, K4=16. That would result in f2=40*(0.1)^2 / (1 +9*0.1 +40*(0.1)^2 +63*(0.1)^3 +16*(0.1)^4 )=0.4 / (1 +0.9 +0.4 +0.063 +0.0016)=0.4/(2.3646)=0.169, which is 16.9%, option D.

But I'm not sure if that's the correct approach. The confusion arises from whether the β's are stepwise or overall.

In most cases, stability constants are stepwise, which would mean I should use β1=9, β2=40, etc., as I did initially. Which leads to [Co(SCN)_2]^2+ being 5.586%, not an option.

But if they are overall, then the answer is 16.9%, option D.

Another possibility is that the question is asking for the percentage of all complexes (excluding free Co²+), which would be 100% -1.55% =98.45%. But that's not applicable.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using a different formula, such as the formation of each complex as a stepwise process, but with the ligand concentration as a variable.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is to consider the fraction of each complex relative to the first one.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is a bit of a trick, and the correct answer is 35.18%, but since that's not an option, perhaps I miscalculated.

Wait, perhaps I should use the logarithm of the fractions or something else, but that doesn't make sense.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the problem is using the total concentration of all thiocyanato complexes, not the free ion.

The total thiocyanato complexes would be [CoSCN^+] + [Co(SCN)_2^2+] + [Co(SCN)_3^3+] + [Co(SCN)_4^4+ ].

Which is 0.9x +3.6x +22.68x +36.288x =63.528x.

But x =1e-2 /64.468≈1.55e-4.

So, 63.528x ≈63.528 *1.55e-4 ≈9.84e-3.

The percentage would be (9.84e-3 /0.01) *100=98.4%, which is not relevant.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is asking for the percentage of the second and third complexes together, which would be 5.586% +35.18% =40.766%, which is close to option A)42.3%.

But the question is specific about the blue dithiocyanato, which I thought was the second complex.

Hmm, I'm getting stuck. I think I need to make an educated guess.

In the initial calculation, considering the stepwise β's, the [Co(SCN)_2]^2+ is about 5.58%, which isn't an option.

But if the problem uses the overall β's as cumulative, then the [Co(SCN)_2]^2+ is 16.9%, which is option D.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem refers to the [Co(SCN)_3]^3+ complex (35.18%) as the blue one. But that's not an option.

Wait, perhaps the question is incorrect, or I'm missing something. Alternatively, perhaps I should take the sum of the second and third complexes.

5.586% +35.18% =40.766%, which is close to option A)42.3%.

But if that's the case, the answer would be A)42.3%.

But the problem specifies 'dithiocyanato', which is two SCN groups, implying the second complex.

Alternatively, perhaps the blue complex is actually the [Co(SCN)_4]^4+ complex, which is 56.29% of the total. But that's not an option either.

After all this, I think the correct approach is to consider that the problem uses the overall β's as cumulative, leading to option D)16.9%.


To determine the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes ([Co(SCN)_2]^2+) among all cobalt-containing species in the solution, the following analysis was conducted:

### Key Information:
- **Cobalt concentration**: \( [\text{Co}] = 10^{-2} \, \text{M} \)
- **Thiocyanate concentration**: \( [\text{SCN}^-] = 0.1 \, \text{M} \)
- **Stability constants**: \( \beta_1 = 9 \), \( \beta_2 = 40 \), \( \beta_3 = 63 \), \( \beta_4 = 16 \)

### Approach:
1. **Fraction of Each Species**: The fraction of each cobalt species is calculated using the formula:
   \[
   f_n = \frac{\beta_1 \beta_2 \dots \beta_n [\text{SCN}]^n}{1 + \beta_1 [\text{SCN}] + \beta_1 \beta_2 [\text{SCN}]^2 + \beta_1 \beta_2 \beta_3 [\text{SCN}]^3 + \dots}
   \]
   where \( n \) represents the number of thiocyanate ligands bound to cobalt.

2. **Denominator Calculation**: The denominator is the sum of all possible species:
   \[
   \text{Denominator} = 1 + \beta_1 [\text{SCN}] + \beta_1 \beta_2 [\text{SCN}]^2 + \beta_1 \beta_2 \beta_3 [\text{SCN}]^3 + \beta_1 \beta_2 \beta_3 \beta_4 [\text{SCN}]^4
   \]
   Substituting the values:
   \[
   \text{Denominator} = 1 + 9(0.1) + 9(40)(0.1)^2 + 9(40)(63)(0.1)^3 + 9(40)(63)(16)(0.1)^4
   \]
   \[
   \text{Denominator} = 1 + 0.9 + 3.6 + 22.68 + 36.288 = 64.468
   \]

3. **Fraction of [Co(SCN)_2]^2+**: The fraction of the dithiocyanato complex ([Co(SCN)_2]^2+) is:
   \[
   f_2 = \frac{\beta_1 \beta_2 [\text{SCN}]^2}{\text{Denominator}} = \frac{9 \cdot 40 \cdot (0.1)^2}{64.468} = \frac{3.6}{64.468} \approx 0.05586 \, (5.586\%)
   \]

4. **Other Fractions**:
   - \( f_1 = \frac{\beta_1 [\text{SCN}]}{\text{Denominator}} = \frac{9 \cdot 0.1}{64.468} \approx 0.01397 \, (1.397\%) \)
   - \( f_3 = \frac{\beta_1 \beta_2 \beta_3 [\text{SCN}]^3}{\text{Denominator}} = \frac{9 \cdot 40 \cdot 63 \cdot (0.1)^3}{64.468} \approx 0.3518 \, (35.18\%) \)
   - \( f_4 = \frac{\beta_1 \beta_2 \beta_3 \beta_4 [\text{SCN}]^4}{\text{Denominator}} = \frac{9 \cdot 40 \cdot 63 \cdot 16 \cdot (0.1)^4}{64.468} \approx 0.5629 \, (56.29\%) \)

5. **Interpretation**:
   - The calculated fraction of [Co(SCN)_2]^2+ is \( 5.586\% \), which does not match any of the provided options.
   - If the problem assumes the stability constants (\( \beta \)) are cumulative rather than stepwise, the fraction of [Co(SCN)_2]^2+ changes. Using cumulative constants, the denominator becomes:
     \[
     \text{Denominator (cumulative)} = 1 + 9(0.1) + 40(0.1)^2 + 63(0.1)^3 + 16(0.1)^4 = 1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016 = 2.3646
     \]
     The fraction of [Co(SCN)_2]^2+ is then:
     \[
     f_2 = \frac{40 \cdot (0.1)^2}{2.3646} = \frac{0.4}{2.3646} \approx 0.169 \, (16.9\%)
     \]
     This matches **Option D**.

### Conclusion:
The problem likely assumes the stability constants are cumulative rather than stepwise. Under this assumption, the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato complex ([Co(SCN)_2]^2+) is **16.9%**.

Answer: D
