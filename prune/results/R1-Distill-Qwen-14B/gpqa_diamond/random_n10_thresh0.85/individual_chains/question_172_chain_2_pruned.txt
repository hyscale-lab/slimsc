Okay, so I have this astronomy question here about stars and their effective temperatures. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think it through.

The question says that iron atoms in star_1's photosphere are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to those in star_2. Oh right, photosphere is the layer from which a star emits most of its light. And LTE stands for Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium, which I think means that each small region of the photosphere is in equilibrium and can be described by a single temperature.

The energy difference between the levels is given as 1.38e-23 J. Wait, I remember that the excitation of atoms in a star's atmosphere relates to the temperature. The higher the temperature, the more energy the atoms have, right? So if the energy levels are more excited, that should mean higher temperature.

I think this has to do with the Boltzmann distribution. The Boltzmann equation describes the population of particles in different energy states. The formula is something like N2/N1 = exp( - (E2 - E1)/(k T) ), where k is Boltzmann's constant and T is the temperature.

In this case, the energy difference ΔE is given as 1.38e-23 J. So E2 - E1 would be ΔE. The problem states that the excitation in star_1 is twice that of star_2. Let me clarify: the ratio of the number of excited atoms in star_1 to star_2 is 2. Or wait, no—the question says "iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited." So maybe the fraction of atoms in the higher energy level is twice as much for star_1 compared to star_2?

Wait no, actually, the question says the iron atoms are twice as excited. So perhaps the excitation refers to the number in a specific energy level. So N1/N2 = 2, where N1 is the number in star_1 and N2 in star_2 for the same energy level.

Wait no, wait. Wait, the question states that in star_1, the number of excited atoms is twice that in star_2. But I'm not entirely sure. Let me re-read. Oh, wait: "iron atoms in the photosphere of star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level when compared to the iron atoms in star_2." Hmm, maybe it's the number in the excited state. So, N1/N2 = 2, where N1 is the number in star_1, and N2 in star_2.

Alternatively, perhaps it's the ratio of the populations. Let me get this right. The Boltzmann factor says that N_upper/N_lower = exp( -ΔE/(k T) ). So for each star, there's a different temperature. Let me denote T1 as star_1's temperature and T2 as star_2's.

So for star_1, N1_upper/N1_lower = exp( -ΔE/(k T1) )

For star_2, N2_upper/N2_lower = exp( -ΔE/(k T2) )

But wait, the question says that in star_1, the atoms are twice as excited as in star_2. Wait, no, the question says the excitation is twice. So perhaps the ratio N_upper/N_lower for star_1 is twice that of star_2.

Wait, but the problem says "iron atoms in the photosphere of star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level when compared to the iron atoms in star_2." Hmm, maybe the specific energy level is the same for both stars. So the number of atoms in a specific (maybe higher) energy state is twice as much in star_1 compared to star_2.

Alternatively, perhaps the ratio of the excited state to the ground state is twice. So, maybe for star_1, the ratio is 2 times that of star_2.

Wait, but the exact wording is a bit ambiguous. Let me clarify. The question states: "iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level when compared to the iron atoms in star_2." So, perhaps the fraction of iron atoms in that specific (excited) energy level in star_1 is twice that of star_2. So N1/N2 = 2, where N refers to the number in that specific energy level.

Alternatively, perhaps the number of excited atoms per unit volume is twice as much in star_1. Either way, the approach would be similar.

So, considering the Boltzmann distribution, the ratio of the population in the excited state to the ground state (or lower state) is given by:

(N_upper)/(N_lower) = exp( -ΔE/(k T) )

So for star_1: (N1_upper)/(N1_lower) = exp( -ΔE/(k T1) )

For star_2: (N2_upper)/(N2_lower) = exp( -ΔE/(k T2) )

But wait, the problem says that in star_1, the excitation is twice that of star_2. So perhaps the ratio (N_upper)/(N_lower) for star_1 is twice that of star_2.

Wait, but the question says "iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level when compared to the iron atoms in star_2." So perhaps the number of excited atoms (N_upper) in star_1 is twice that in star_2, but considering the same lower state. So perhaps (N1_upper)/(N1_lower) = 2 * (N2_upper)/(N2_lower).

Wait, no, that's not the correct interpretation. Alternatively, perhaps the number of atoms in the higher energy level in star_1 is twice that in star_2. So N1_upper = 2 N2_upper.

But wait, each star's photosphere has its own total number of atoms. Alternatively, perhaps the fraction of atoms in that specific energy level is twice as high in star_1. Hmm, perhaps that's a better approach.

So, the fraction of atoms in the excited state in star_1 is twice that in star_2. Let me denote f1 as the fraction in star_1 and f2 as that in star_2. So f1 = 2 f2.

But wait, the fraction f is given by the Boltzmann factor. Since f_upper = N_upper / (N_upper + N_lower) = [exp( -ΔE/(k T) ) ] / [1 + exp( -ΔE/(k T) ) ]

Wait, but that complicates things. Alternatively, if the lower state is much more populated, perhaps f_upper ≈ exp( -ΔE/(k T) ). But that's only an approximation when the lower state is the ground state and much more populated.

Wait, but perhaps the question is simplifying it by assuming that the number in the excited state is proportional to the Boltzmann factor. So, N_upper is proportional to exp( -ΔE/(k T) ). So, for star_1, N1_upper = A * exp( -ΔE/(k T1) ), and for star_2, N2_upper = A * exp( -ΔE/(k T2) ), where A is a proportionality constant.

But the question says that the number of excited atoms in star_1 is twice that in star_2. So N1_upper = 2 N2_upper.

So, substituting, A exp( -ΔE/(k T1) ) = 2 A exp( -ΔE/(k T2) )

The A cancels out, so exp( -ΔE/(k T1) ) = 2 exp( -ΔE/(k T2) )

Divide both sides by exp( -ΔE/(k T2) ), we get exp( -ΔE/(k T1) + ΔE/(k T2) ) = 2.

Take natural logarithm on both sides: (-ΔE/(k T1) + ΔE/(k T2)) ) = ln(2)

Factor out ΔE/k: (ΔE/k) ( 1/(T2) - 1/(T1) ) ) = ln(2 )

Wait, because 1/(T2) - 1/(T1) is (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2)

Wait, let me compute:

(1/T2 - 1/T1) = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2)

So, substituting back:

(ΔE/k) * (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) ) = ln(2 )

Multiply both sides by (k / ΔE):

(T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) ) = ( ln(2) * k ) / ΔE

Wait
