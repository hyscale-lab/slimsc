Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds. Hmm, I need to find the relative speed between them and the total energy of the system. Let me think about how to approach this.

First, the problem states that the two astronauts have masses of 2m and 3m. They're moving in the positive x-direction at 0.6c and 0.5c respectively. I remember that when dealing with relative velocities in relativity, you can't just subtract the speeds like you would in classical mechanics. Oh right, you have to use the velocity addition formula from special relativity.

Wait, what's that formula again? Oh yeah, the formula for the relative velocity u' when moving from one frame to another is (u - v)/(1 - (uv)/c²). But wait, wait. Let me get that right. No, actually, in this case, astronaut A is moving at 0.6c, and astronaut B at 0.5c. So from A's perspective, what is the speed of B?

Wait no, wait. Wait, wait. Let me clarify. The question is asking for the relative speed of the two astronauts. So if astronaut A is moving at 0.6c and B at 0.5c, but both are moving in the same direction. So from A's frame, what is B's speed?

Wait, but in reality, in relativity, the relative velocity isn't simply 0.1c. Because velocities don't add linearly. So I have to apply the relativistic velocity addition formula.

Wait, the formula is (u - v) / (1 - (u v)/c²), where u is the velocity of B in the original frame, and v is the velocity of A in the original frame. Because from A's frame, B is moving at (u - v) divided by that factor.

Wait, but wait. Let's make sure: in the original frame, say S, astronaut A is moving at velocity v = 0.6c, and astronaut B is moving at u = 0.5c. So from A's perspective, which is moving at v relative to S, what is B's speed?

So the formula should be (u - v) divided by (1 - (u v)/(c²)).

Plugging in the numbers: u is 0.5c, v is 0.6c.

So numerator is (0.5c -
