Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this physics problem about the speed of light in glass when the glass itself is moving. Hmm, let me think through this step by step.

Alright, the question says a light beam is propagating through a glass with an index of refraction n. The glass is moving at a constant velocity v in the same direction as the beam and towards the observer. I need to find the speed of light in the glass relative to the laboratory frame.

Wait, I remember something about the speed of light in a medium. Oh right, in a medium with refractive index n, the speed of light is v_medium = c/n, where c is the speed of light in a vacuum. But wait, this is in the rest frame of the medium. How does the motion of the medium affect this?

Oh, right, this has to do with special relativity, particularly the velocity addition formula. Because when the medium is moving relative to the observer, the speed of light doesn't just add up like in classical mechanics. Special relativity says that light always travels at speed c in a vacuum, regardless of the observer's frame. But here, the medium is moving, and the light is inside the medium, so things are a bit different.

Wait, but the speed of light in the medium is v = c/n in the medium's rest frame. So when the medium is moving, how do we find the speed of the light beam in the lab frame?

I think I should use the relativistic velocity addition formula. The formula is u' = (u + v) / (1 + (u*v)/cÂ²), where u is the velocity in one frame, and u' is the velocity in another frame moving relative to the first at speed v.

In this case, the medium (glass) is moving at velocity v relative to the lab frame. The light's velocity in the medium's rest frame is u = c/n, right? But wait, the direction matters. The light is moving in the same direction as the glass's motion. So in the medium's frame, the light's speed is u = c/n in the same direction as the glass's velocity.

Wait, no. Wait, the light is propagating through the glass towards the observer, and the glass is moving in the same direction as the beam. So in the lab frame, the light is coming towards the observer, but the glass (and hence the light's medium) is moving towards the observer as well.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me clarify the frames:

1. Lab frame: the
