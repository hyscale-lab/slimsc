Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm a bit rusty on electrostatics, but let's try to work through it step by step. The question is about finding the minimum energy of an isolated system of charges.

Alright, the setup: there are 13 identical particles, each with a charge of 2e. So e is the elementary charge, about 1.602 x 10^-19 coulombs. So each charge is 2 * 1.602e-19 = 3.204e-19 C. 

12 of these charges are constrained to stay at 2 meters from a point P. The 13th charge is fixed at P. So the 13th charge is at the origin, and the other 12 are each 2 meters away from P.

Wait, so the 12 charges are each a distance of 2 meters from P, which is where the 13th charge is. So each of these 12 charges is located on the surface of a sphere with radius 2 meters around P. But they're identical charges, so same sign? Well, like charges would repel, but in this case, maybe it's about the potential energy of the system.

But the question is about the minimum energy. So I'm thinking that the system's potential energy would be the sum of the potential energies between each pair of charges. Oh, right, because in an isolated system, the potential energy is due to all the interactions between the charges.

Wait, but the 13th charge is fixed. So the energy would involve the interactions between all the other 12 charges and the fixed one at P, plus the interactions between the 12 charges themselves.

But since the 12 charges are constrained at 2 meters from P, I'm guessing they form a regular structure, maybe a regular dodecahedron or something, but perhaps for simplicity, each of them is at the same distance from P, but their mutual distances might vary, but maybe in the minimum energy configuration, they arrange themselves symmetrically to minimize repulsion.

But wait, the problem doesn't specify the arrangement of the 12 charges around P. Hmm. Since they are identical and each is 2 meters from P, maybe it's easier to model them as being on a sphere of radius 2 m, uniformly distributed in some way.

But perhaps it's easier to compute the potential energy as the sum of all pairs. Wait, but which pairs?

The system's potential energy U is the sum of the potential energies between each pair of charges.

So, there are two types of interactions: 

1. Between the fixed charge (at P) and each of the 12 charges. There are 12 such pairs.

2. Between each pair of the
