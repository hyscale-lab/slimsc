Okay, so I've got this question about which stars can be detected by two different spectrographs: ESPRESSO at Paranal and HIRES at Keck. Hmm, I need to figure this out step by step.

First, I remember that both telescopes have different brightness limits for the stars they can observe. The question says that ESPRESSO can handle stars brighter than 17 V magnitude, while HIRES can go down to brighter than 16 V. So, any star that's too faint (like magnitude higher than 17) can't be seen by ESPRESSO, but if it's brighter than 16, it's visible by both? Wait, wait. Wait, no. Let me think again. The question says, "brighter than 17 mag can be observed" with ESPRESSO and "brighter than 16 V mag" with HIRES. So, a star that's magnitude 16 would be visible to HIRES but not ESPRESSO since ESPRESSO requires brighter than 17 (so 16 is fainter than 17, so 16 is beyond ESPRESSO's limitâ€”no, wait, no. Wait, stars with lower magnitudes are brighter. Oh, right. So if a star is magnitude 16, it's fainter than 17. So, for ESPRESSO, only stars with V mag < 17 can be observed. For HIRES, only stars <16. So, if a star is magnitude 17, ESPRESSO can't see it. If it's 16.5, HIRES can't see it either, because 16.5 is higher than 16? Wait, no. Wait, the V magnitude scale is such that lower numbers are brighter. So, the maximum brightness for ESPRESSO is 17 mag (so only stars brighter than that, meaning V <17 can be observed). Similarly, HIRES can observe stars brighter than 16 mag, so V <16.

Wait, the question says: with ESPRESSO, stars with V mag brighter than 17 can be observed. So, V <17. And with HIRES, stars brighter than 16, so V<16.

So, any star that has V magnitude less than 16 can be detected by both. Because if a star is V=15, it's within both limits
