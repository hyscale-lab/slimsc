Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit confused but let me try to work through it step by step. The question is about finding the probability of measuring an electron in certain eigenstates and calculating the average value of an operator. Hmm, I remember that in quantum mechanics, the state of a particle is described by a ket vector, and when you want to find the probability of measuring a particular eigenstate, you take the inner product of the state with that eigenstate.

The given state is |alpha>, which is proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>. Oh wait, proportional means it's equal up to a normalization factor. So first, I think I should normalize this state. Because probabilities must sum to one, right?

So, |up> and |down> are eigenstates of the z-projection of spin. That makes sense, so they form an orthonormal basis. The state |alpha> is in this basis. The components are (1+i) for |up> and (2-i) for |down>. To normalize, I need to calculate the inner product of |alpha> with itself and then divide by its square root to get the unit vector.

Let me compute the inner product. The inner product <alpha|alpha> would be |1+i|² + |2-i|². Because the basis states are orthonormal, the cross terms (like |1+i|*(2-i) and vice versa) will cancel out when taking the inner product.

Wait, no, wait. Wait, no, when you compute <alpha|alpha>, it's (1-i) for the up component (since the conjugate of (1+i) is (1-i)) and (2+i) for the down component (the conjugate of (2-i) is (2+i)). So the inner product is (1+i)(1-i) + (2-i)(2+i).

Calculating each term:
(1+i)(1-i) = 1^2 + (i)(-i) + ... Wait, wait, no, more accurately, (a + b)(a - b) = a² - b². So (1+i)(1-i) = 1^2 - (i)^2 = 1 - (-1) = 2.

Similarly, (2 - i)(2 + i) = 2^2 - (i)^2 = 4 - (-1) = 5.

So the total inner product is 2 +5=7. Therefore, the normalization factor is 1/sqrt(7). So the state |alpha> is [1/(sqrt(7)))] * ( (1+i)|up> + (2 -i)|down> ).

Now, the question mentions an operator whose matrix elements A_ij are given as hbar/2 if i≠j and 0 otherwise. Wait, matrix representation? So the operator is 2x2. Let me think about the basis. Since the states are |up> and |down>, the operator is in this basis. So the matrix for A should be:

A = [ [0, hbar/2],
       [hbar/2, 0] ]

Because for i=j, A_ij is 0, and for i≠j, it's hbar/2. So this looks like a spin-x operator scaled by hbar/2. Because the Pauli X matrix is [[0,1],[1,0]], so this operator is (hbar/2) * X.

So the eigenstates of this operator would be the eigenstates of the Pauli X matrix, which are |+x> and |−x>, the spin eigenstates along the x-axis. The eigenvectors are (1/sqrt(2))(|up> + |down>) and (1/sqrt(2))(|up> − |down>), with eigenvalues +hbar/2 and -hbar/2 respectively.

Wait, but in our case, the operator A is equal to (hbar/2) times the Pauli X matrix. So its eigenvalues are (hbar/2) * (1) and (hbar/2) * (-1), which are hbar/2 and -hbar/2.

So when we measure the operator A, the possible outcomes are hbar/2 and -hbar/2, with probabilities equal to the square of the amplitude of the corresponding eigenstate in |alpha>.

Wait, no. Wait, another approach: for the operator A, whose matrix is (hbar/2) * [[0,1],[1,0]], the eigenstates are |+x> and |−x>, as I said. So to find the probability of getting each eigenvalue, I need to express |alpha> in terms of |+x> and |−x> and then find the coefficients squared.

Wait, that's the way to go. Because the possible results of A are the eigenvalues, so the probabilities come from the expansion of |alpha> in the eigenbasis of A.

So, first, let me write the eigenstates of A.

|+x> = (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2)
|−x> = (|up> − |down>)/sqrt(2)

So, our state |alpha> is [ (1+i) |up> + (2 - i)|down> ] / sqrt(7)

I need to express |alpha> as a linear combination of |+x> and |−x>.

Let me write |alpha> = c_+ |+x> + c_- |−x>

So substitute |+x> and |−x> into this equation.

(1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down> = sqrt(7) [ c_+ (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2) + c_- (|up> − |down>)/sqrt(2) ]

Simplify the right-hand side:

= [ c_+ + c_- ] |up> / sqrt(2) + [ c_+ - c_- ] |down> / sqrt(2) )

Multiply both sides by sqrt(2):

(1+i) |up> + (2-i)|down> = sqrt(2) [ (c_+ + c_-) |up> + (c_+ - c_-) |down> ]

Now, equate coefficients for |up> and |down>:

For |up>:
1 + i = sqrt(2) (c_+ + c_- )

For |down>:
2 - i = sqrt(2) (c_+ - c_- )

So we have two equations:

1. c_+ + c_- = (1 + i)/sqrt(2)
2. c_+ - c_- = (2 - i)/sqrt(2)

We can solve for c_+ and c_-.

Adding equations 1 and 2:

2 c_+ = [ (1 + i) + (2 - i) ] / sqrt(2) = (3) / sqrt(2)
So c_+ = 3/(2 sqrt(2)) )

Subtracting equation 2 from equation 1:

2 c_- = [ (1 + i) - (2 - i) ] / sqrt(2) = (-1 + 2i) / sqrt(2)
So c_- = (-1 + 2i)/(2 sqrt(2))

So now, the coefficients are:

c_+ = 3/(2 sqrt(2)) )
c_- = (-1 + 2i)/(2 sqrt(2) )

Wait, let me double-check the calculations.

Wait equation 1: 1+i = sqrt(2)(c_+ + c_-)
Equation 2: 2 -i = sqrt(2)(c_+ - c_-)
Adding: 3 = sqrt(2)(2 c_+)
So c_+ = 3/(2 sqrt(2)) )

Subtracting: (1+i) - (2 -i ) = sqrt(2)(2 c_- )
( -1 + 2i ) = sqrt(2) * 2 c_-
So c_- = (-1 + 2i )/( 2 sqrt(2) )

Yes, that's correct.

Now, the probability of measuring +hbar/2 is |c_+|² and the probability for -hbar/2 is |c_-|².

Compute |c_+|²:

c_+ = 3/(2 sqrt(2)) = 3/(2*1.414...) ≈ 3/(2.828) ≈ 1.0607

But let's compute the modulus squared.

|c_+|² = (3^2)/( (2 sqrt(2))^2 ) = 9/(4*2) )= 9/8 = 1.125. Wait, that can't be, because probabilities can't be more than one.

Wait wait, that's impossible. So I must have made a mistake. Wait where?

Wait, because |alpha> is normalized. So the sum of the probabilities must be 1.

But let's recheck the calculation.

Wait, when I set |alpha> = (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>, and then normalized by 1/sqrt(7). So the state is (1+i)/sqrt(7) |up> + (2 -i)/sqrt(7) |down>.

Expressed in terms of |+x> and |-x>, which are (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2) and (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2).

So when I express |alpha> as c_+ |+x> + c_- |−x>, I have:

(1+i)/sqrt(7) |up> + (2-i)/sqrt(7) |down> = c_+ (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2) ) + c_- (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2) )

Multiply both sides by sqrt(2):

(1+i)/sqrt(7) * sqrt(2) |up> + (2-i)/sqrt(7) * sqrt(2) |down> = (c_+ + c_-) |up> + (c_+ - c_-) |down>

So equating coefficients:

(1+i) sqrt(2)/sqrt(7) = c_+ + c_-     [1]
(2 -i) sqrt(2)/sqrt(7) = c_+ - c_-   [2]

Wait, I think I made a mistake earlier. Because when I multiplied both sides by sqrt(2), I should have done it correctly. Let me redo this.

Previously, I had:

(1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down> = sqrt(2) [ (c_+ + c_-)|up> + (c_+ - c_-)|down> ]

Wait, no, that's not correct. Because |alpha> is (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down> ) divided by sqrt(7), right? So the left side is [ (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down> ] / sqrt(7).

So when I express it as c_+ |+x> + c_- |−x>, each |+x> is (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2), so when I expand, it becomes:

c_+ (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2) ) + c_- ( |up> - |down> ) / sqrt(2) )

Which is [ (c_+ + c_- ) |up> + (c_+ - c_- ) |down> ] / sqrt(2)

So equate to |alpha>:

[ (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down> ] / sqrt(7) = [ (c_+ + c_- ) |up> + (c_+ - c_- ) |down> ] / sqrt(2)

So, we get:

(1+i)/sqrt(7) = (c_+ + c_- ) / sqrt(2)   [1]
(2 -i)/sqrt(7) = (c_+ - c_- ) / sqrt(2)   [2]

So now, multiply both sides by sqrt(2):

c_+ + c_- = (1+i) sqrt(2)/sqrt(7) [equation 1]
c_+ - c_- = (2 -i) sqrt(2)/sqrt(7) [equation 2]

Now, adding equations 1 and 2:

2c_+ = [ (1+i) + (2 -i) ] * sqrt(2)/sqrt(7)
Simplify numerator: 1 + 2 + i - i =3
So 2c_+ = 3 * sqrt(2)/sqrt(7)
=> c_+ = (3 sqrt(2)) / (2 sqrt(7)) )

Similarly, subtracting equation 2 from equation 1:

2c_- = [ (1+i) - (2 -i) ] * sqrt(2)/sqrt(7)
= [ -1 + 2i ] * sqrt(2)/sqrt(7)
=> c_- = (-1 + 2i) * sqrt(2)/(2 sqrt(7)) )

Now, compute |c_+|² and |c_-|².

First, |c_+|²:

c_+ = [3 sqrt(2) ] / [2 sqrt(7) ] = 3/(sqrt(14)) )

So |c_+|² = (9)/(14)

Similarly, c_- is [ (-1 + 2i) * sqrt(2) ] / [2 sqrt(7) ]

Compute the modulus squared:

| (-1 + 2i) |^2 = (-1)^2 + (2)^2 = 1 +4=5

Then, |c_-|² = [ ( sqrt(2) )^2 * 5 ] / [ (2 sqrt(7))^2 * ... ]

Wait, more accurately:

c_- = ( (-1 + 2i) ) * sqrt(2)/(2 sqrt(7)) )

So |c_-|² = | (-1 + 2i) |² * [ (sqrt(2))^2 ] / [ (2 sqrt(7))^2 ]

= (1 + 4) * 2 / [4 *7 ]

= 5 *2 / 28 

= 10/28 = 5/14

Wait, let me compute each part.

Compute numerator: |(-1 + 2i)|^2 is 1 +4 =5.

Multiply by (sqrt(2))^2 which is 2: 5 * 2=10.

Denominator: (2 sqrt(7))^2=4 *7=28.

So 10/28 =5/14.

So probabilities are |c_+|²=9/14 and |c_-|²=5/14.

Wait, 9/14 is approximately 0.6429, and 5/14 is approximately 0.3571.

Now, looking at the options:

Option A: 0.64, 0.36 (sum to 1.00) and hbar/7 average.

Option D: 0.61, 0.29 (sum 0.90) no, that's not.

Wait, wait, 9/14 is about 0.6429, which is approximately 0.64. 5/14 is about 0.357, which is roughly 0.36.

So the probabilities are approximately 64% and 36%. So the probabilities would be 9/14 ≈0.6429 and 5/14≈0.3571.

Looking at the options, option A says 0.64 and 0.36, and the average is hbar/7. Hmm, but let's check the average.

The average value of the operator A is given by <alpha| A |alpha>.

Alternatively, since A has eigenvalues plus and minus hbar/2, and the probabilities are 9/14 and 5/14, the expectation value is (9/14)(hbar/2) + (5/14)(-hbar/2) = [9 -5]/(28) hbar =4/28 hbar = 1/7 hbar.

Wait, that's hbar/7. So the average is hbar/7.

Looking back at the options, option A says average hbar/7, probabilities 0.64 and 0.36. So that matches.

Wait, but the operator A is given as A_ij = hbar/2 if i≠j, else 0. So it's a 2x2 matrix with zeros on the diagonal and hbar/2 elsewhere. So the matrix is:

[ [0, hbar/2],
  [hbar/2, 0] ]

Which is indeed (hbar/2) times the Pauli X matrix. So the eigenvalues are ± hbar/2.

So the expectation value would be summing the probabilities multiplied by their eigenvalues.

Hmm, so (9/14)(hbar/2) + (5/14)(-hbar/2) = (9 -5)/(14*2) * hbar = (4/(28)) hbar = 1/7 hbar. So yes, that's correct.

So the probabilities are about 64% and 36%, and the average is hbar/7.

Looking at the options, option A is 0.64, 0.36, and hbar/7. So that's the correct answer.

Wait, but let me check the other options.

Option B: 0.54, 0.46. Doesn't match our 0.64 and 0.36.

Option C: 0.28, 0.72. Not matching.

Option D: 0.61, 0.29. Not matching.

So the correct option is A.


To solve the problem, we start by normalizing the given state \( |\alpha\rangle \), which is proportional to \( (1+i)|\uparrow\rangle + (2-i)|\downarrow\rangle \). The normalization factor is determined by computing the inner product \( \langle \alpha | \alpha \rangle \), which equals \( |1+i|^2 + |2-i|^2 = 2 + 5 = 7 \). Thus, the normalized state is:

\[
|\alpha\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{7}} \left( (1+i)|\uparrow\rangle + (2-i)|\downarrow\rangle \right).
\]

Next, we consider the operator \( A \) with matrix elements \( A_{ij} = \frac{\hbar}{2} \) if \( i \neq j \), and \( A_{ij} = 0 \) otherwise. This operator corresponds to \( \frac{\hbar}{2} \sigma_x \), where \( \sigma_x \) is the Pauli \( X \)-matrix. The eigenstates of \( A \) are the eigenstates of \( \sigma_x \), given by:

\[
|+x\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(|\uparrow\rangle + |\downarrow\rangle), \quad |-x\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(|\uparrow\rangle - |\downarrow\rangle),
\]

with eigenvalues \( \frac{\hbar}{2} \) and \( -\frac{\hbar}{2} \), respectively.

To find the probabilities of measuring the eigenvalues \( \frac{\hbar}{2} \) and \( -\frac{\hbar}{2} \), we express \( |\alpha\rangle \) in the \( |+x\rangle, |-x\rangle \) basis. Substituting the expressions for \( |+x\rangle \) and \( |-x\rangle \) into \( |\alpha\rangle \), we solve for the coefficients \( c_+ \) and \( c_- \) such that:

\[
|\alpha\rangle = c_+ |+x\rangle + c_- |-x\rangle.
\]

Equating coefficients of \( |\uparrow\rangle \) and \( |\downarrow\rangle \), we find:

\[
c_+ + c_- = \frac{1+i}{\sqrt{2}}, \quad c_+ - c_- = \frac{2-i}{\sqrt{2}}.
\]

Solving these equations gives:

\[
c_+ = \frac{3}{2\sqrt{2}}, \quad c_- = \frac{-1+2i}{2\sqrt{2}}.
\]

The probabilities are the squared magnitudes of these coefficients:

\[
|c_+|^2 = \left| \frac{3}{2\sqrt{2}} \right|^2 = \frac{9}{14}, \quad |c_-|^2 = \left| \frac{-1+2i}{2\sqrt{2}} \right|^2 = \frac{5}{14}.
\]

Thus, the probabilities of measuring \( \frac{\hbar}{2} \) and \( -\frac{\hbar}{2} \) are approximately \( 0.64 \) and \( 0.36 \), respectively.

The average value of \( A \) is computed as:

\[
\langle A \rangle = \langle \alpha | A | \alpha \rangle = |c_+|^2 \cdot \frac{\hbar}{2} + |c_-|^2 \cdot \left(-\frac{\hbar}{2}\right).
\]

Substituting the probabilities:

\[
\langle A \rangle = \frac{9}{14} \cdot \frac{\hbar}{2} + \frac{5}{14} \cdot \left(-\frac{\hbar}{2}\right) = \frac{9-5}{28} \hbar = \frac{\hbar}{7}.
\]

Finally, comparing with the options, the correct answer is:

**A) 0.64, 0.36, and \( \frac{\hbar}{7} \).**
