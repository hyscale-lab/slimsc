Okay, so I have this physics problem here, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is.

So, the problem says there are two astronauts with masses 2m and 3m. They're moving at relativistic speeds: 0.6c and 0.5c, both in the positive x-direction. I need to find the relative speed between them and the total energy of the system. The options are A to D.

Hmm, relativistic speeds... that means I can't just use classical mechanics. I remember that at speeds close to the speed of light, you have to use Einstein's equations. So for relative velocity, maybe I should use the velocity addition formula from special relativity.

Wait, the velocity addition formula is when you have two objects moving at speeds u and v relative to a rest frame, and you want to find the speed of one as seen from the other. The formula is (u - v)/(1 - (uv)/c²). Right, because when you switch frames, you don't just subtract the velocities like in Galilean relativity.

Wait, but in this case, both astronauts are moving in the same direction. So the relative speed would be the difference in their speeds, but adjusted by the relativistic formula. Let me get that straight.

First astronaut's speed relative to the lab frame is u = 0.6c. Second is v = 0.5c. So from the first astronaut's frame, what's the speed of the second astronaut? Or vice versa. The question asks for the relative speed, so it doesn't matter which direction, but the formula will take care of that.

Wait no, actually, the relative speed between them would be the speed of one as seen from the other. So if the first is moving at 0.6c, and the second at 0.5c in the same direction, the second is slower. So from the first astronaut's perspective, the second is moving at (0.6c -0.5c)/(1 - (0.6c *0.5c)/c²). Let me compute that.

Wait, let me compute the numerator and denominator. Numerator is 0.1c. Denominator is 1 - (0.3c²)/c² = 1 - 0.3 = 0.7. So the relative speed is (0.1c) / 0.7 = (1/7)c ≈ 0.1428c. So around 0.14c. That's one
