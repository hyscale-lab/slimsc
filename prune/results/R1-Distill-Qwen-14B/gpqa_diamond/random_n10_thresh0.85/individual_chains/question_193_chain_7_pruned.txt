Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here, and I'm trying to figure out the right answer. Let me think this through step by step.

The question says that the number of stars varies with parallax as 1 over parallax to the fifth power, so N ∝ 1/plx^5. Hmm, I remember that parallax (plx) is related to distance. Oh right, parallax is inversely proportional to distance. So plx = 1/d, where d is the distance. Wait, wait, no, more accurately, plx in arcseconds is 1 divided by the distance in parsecs. So plx (in arcsec) = 1 / distance (parsecs). So distance d is 1/plx.

Now, the number of stars N is proportional to 1/(plx)^5. Let me write that down: N ∝ 1/plx^5. Since plx is 1/d, substituting that in, N should be proportional to (d)^5. Because 1/( (1/d) )^5 is d^5. So N ∝ d^5.

But wait, the question is about how the number of stars changes with distance, per unit range of distance r. Oh, so they're asking about dN/dr, the rate of change with respect to distance. If N is proportional to d^5, then dN/dr is 5*d^4. So the number of stars increases with the fourth power of distance per unit distance.

Wait, no, that's not what the question is exactly asking. Wait, the number varies as 1/plx^5. So N is proportional to plx^-5. Because plx is inversely proportional to distance, plx = 1/d. So N = k * (1/plx)^5, where k is some constant. Wait no, the question says N varies with 1/plx^5, so N = k * (1/plx)^5, which is the same as k * d^5. So N increases with d^5.

But the question is about how the number changes with distance. So the rate of change of N with respect to d would be dN/dd. If N is proportional to d^5, then dN/dd =5 d^4. So the number of stars increases with each additional distance in a way that's proportional to d^4. So per unit r (distance), the change is proportional to r^4.

Wait, but the options are in terms of r, so I think the question is asking, for a given range of distance dr, how does the number of stars change? So
