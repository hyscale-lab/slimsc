Okay, let's try to figure out which stars can be detected by both ESPRESSO and HIRES spectrographs. I remember that each of these spectrographs has different magnitude limits. So the first thing I need to do is figure out which stars are bright enough for both.

From the question, ESPRESSO can observe stars with V magnitudes brighter than 17. Wait, actually, the wording is a bit confusing. Oh, right, "brighter than 17 mag" means magnitude less than 17 because lower numbers are brighter. So for ESPRESSO, stars with V ≤17 can be observed. Similarly, HIRES can observe stars brighter than 16, so V ≤16 because it's more sensitive.

Wait, no. Let me get this right. The question says, "stars with apparent V magnitudes brighter than 17 mag can be observed". Oh wait, that's the opposite. Because in astronomy, lower magnitudes are brighter. So if a star is brighter than 17 mag, that would mean its magnitude is less than 17. So ESPRESSO can observe stars with V <17. HIRES can observe stars with V <16.

So any star that is within V <16 can be detected by both, because HIRES can't see beyond 16, but ESPRESSO can go a bit fainter. Wait, no, HIRES can observe V brighter than 16, so V <16. ESPRESSO can do up to 17. So any star with V magnitude less than 16 can be detected
