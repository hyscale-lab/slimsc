Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about particle decay. I'm a bit rusty, but let's try to work through it step by step.

The question provides a Lagrangian interaction term between a bosonic field X and fermions. The Lagrangian is given as L(y) = -λf f-bar ψ_f (y) (v + X(y)) ψ_f(y). Hmm, I think this is like a Yukawa interaction term. From what I remember, Yukawa couplings are between fermions and bosons, mediating forces like the strong force with gluons and quarks.

The mass of the boson X is 6 GeV. The question is about the kinematically allowed decays of X at the lowest order. So, what's kinematically allowed? Well, the energy (mass) of X needs to be enough to produce the particles in the decay products.

Looking at the options, they list various fermion-antifermion pairs as possible decay products. So X can decay into pairs like b b-bar, c c-bar, etc. But the key is, which of these pairs have a combined mass less than or equal to 6 GeV?

First, I need to remember the masses of the fermions. Let me jot down the approximate masses:

- Up and down quarks (u, d): Their masses are around a few MeV. Like, up is about 2.2 MeV, down maybe 4.7 MeV. So their combined mass would be super low compared to 6 GeV. So uū and ddbar are possible.

- Strange quark (s): Mass is about 95-100 MeV. So s s-bar would have a combined mass of around 200 MeV, way below 6 GeV.

- Charm quark (c): Heavier, around 1.2-1.5 GeV. So c c-bar would require twice that, about 3 GeV. That's within 6 GeV, so that's allowed.

- Bottom quark (b): Mass is around 4.5-5 GeV. So b b-bar would require about 9 GeV, which is more than X's mass (6 GeV). So that's not allowed.

Wait, wait, the mass of the X is 6 GeV. So for a decay into a fermion-antifermion pair, each must have mass less than 3 GeV because 2*3=6. So any fermion with mass less than or equal to 3 GeV can be produced.

Wait, but the bottom quark's mass is about 4.5 GeV, so even a single b quark is more than half of 6 GeV. So b b-bar would require 2*4.5=9 GeV, which X doesn't have. So X can't decay into b b-bar.

So looking back at the options, options A and D include b b-bar, which would be impossible. So those can be eliminated.

Now, let's look at the other quarks. So u, d, s, c are possible.

What about leptons? The decay could involve charged leptons, like e+, e-, mu+, mu-, tau+, tau-.

Tau mass is about 1.78 GeV. So two taus would be 3.56 GeV, which is under 6 GeV. So tau+ tau- is allowed.

Similarly, electrons and muons are much lighter. Their masses are negligible compared to 6 GeV, so e+ e- and mu+ mu- are definitely allowed.

So possible decay channels include all quark-antiquark pairs where each quark has mass less than 3 GeV, and all lepton pairs where the total mass is less than 6 GeV.

So checking the options again. Option B says X→c c-bar, s s-bar, u u-bar, d d-bar, tau+ tau-, mu+ mu-, e+ e-.

Wait, but wait, the tau mass is
