Okay, so I've got this question about stars and their effective temperatures based on the excitation of iron atoms in their photospheres. Hmm, I remember from my studies that this has something to do with the Boltzmann distribution and the concept of Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE). Let me think this through step by step.

The question states that iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited as those in star_2. The energy difference between the energy levels is given as 1.38x10^-23 J. Oh wait, that's the same as k (Boltzmann's constant) which is approximately 1.38e-23 J/K. Interesting, so the energy difference (ΔE) is equal to k. That might simplify things.

In LTE, the population of energy levels in a star's atmosphere can be described by the Boltzmann equation. The ratio of the number of atoms in two energy levels (say, level 2 and level 1) is given by (n2/n1) = exp( -ΔE/(k T) ). Wait, more precisely, the ratio is proportional to exp( -ΔE/(k T) ), because higher energy levels have fewer atoms at thermal equilibrium.

In this case, the excitation level is higher for star_1. So, let's denote that the ratio for star_1 is n1_2/n1_1 = 2 (since twice as excited). For star_2, it would be n2_2/n2_1, which I'll call something else. Wait, no. The problem says that the iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited. So maybe the ratio of the excited state to the ground state is higher in star_1. So for star_1, (n_upper / n_lower) is twice as much as in star_2.

So, let's set up the equations. For star_1, n1_upper / n1_lower = 2 (times star_2's ratio). So, for star_2, it's n2_upper / n2_lower = 1 (since it's half the excitation level of star_1? Or wait, no, the question says it's twice as excited. So for star_1, the ratio is 2 times that of star_2. So if star_2's ratio is x, star_1's is 2x.

But wait, to clarify: the excitation is twice as high. So if in star_1, the number of atoms in the excited state is twice that in star_2's excited state, but wait, actually, the way it's worded is that the atoms are twice as excited in star_1. So I think the ratio n_upper/n_lower is higher for star_1. So for star_1, the ratio is 2 times that of star_2.

So, let's write the equations using the Boltzmann factor.

For star_1: n1_upper / n1_lower = exp( -ΔE/(k T1) ) 

Wait, wait, no. Wait, the Boltzmann factor is for
