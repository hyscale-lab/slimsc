Okay, so I have this problem about finding the area of a pseudosphere with radius r=2 using the given metric. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my general relativity and differential geometry, but let me think through this step by step.

The metric given is ds² = (32)/(4 - x² - y²) (dx² + dy²). Wait, I'm not sure if that's the correct interpretation. Oh wait, the denominator is (4 -x² -y²), and the numerator is 32, so the coefficient is 32/(4 - x² - y²). 

Wait, pseudospheres are surfaces of constant negative curvature, right? The metric usually has a form that reflects hyperbolic geometry. But this metric looks a bit different from what I'm used to seeing. Let me try to analyze it.

The metric is in two dimensions, so it's for a surface. The expression ds² = g(x,y) (dx² + dy²) suggests that it's conformally flat, meaning it's related to the Euclidean metric by a conformal factor. The conformal factor here is 32/(4 - x² - y²). 

Hmm, so the area element in such a metric would be the determinant of the metric tensor multiplied by dx dy. Since it's diagonal and conformally flat, the determinant is just [32/(4 - x² - y²)]². But wait, the area element is actually the square root of the determinant of the metric tensor times dx dy. Since the metric is (g_xx, g_yy) and g_xy = 0, the determinant is g_xx * g_yy = (32/(4 - x² - y²))². The square root of that is 32/(4 - x² - y²). So the area element dA is [32/(4 - x² - y
