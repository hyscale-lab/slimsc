Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about titrating acetic acid with NaOH. Hmm, let me see. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

The problem says we're diluting 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid with 20.00 cm³ of water. Then we titrate the diluted solution with 0.1 M NaOH. The question is asking what the pH will be at 25% titration and at the equivalence point. The options are A to D, each with two pH values.

First, I think I need to figure out the concentration of acetic acid after dilution. Oh right, when you dilute a solution, the concentration changes. The initial volume is 20 cm³, and we're adding another 20 cm³ of water. So the total volume is 40 cm³. The concentration should be (volume1 × concentration1) / total volume. So (20 × 0.05) /40 = 1/40. Wait, 20 times 0.05 is 1, divided by 40 is 0.025 M. So the diluted acetic acid concentration is 0.025 M.

Next, I need to find the equivalence point. At equivalence, moles of NaOH equal moles of acetic acid. Wait, but wait, the initial moles of acetic acid are (volume in liters) × molarity. So 0.02 L × 0.05 M = 0.001 mol. NaOH has a molarity of 0.1 M. So moles of NaOH needed is 0.001 mol. Volume = moles / Molarity. So 0.001 / 0.1 = 0.01 L, which is 10 cm³. So the equivalence point is when 10 cm³ of NaOH is added.

But wait, the problem is about 25% titration. 25% of what? Oh, maybe 25% of the equivalence point volume. So 25% of 10 cm³ is 2.5 cm³. So at 25% titration, 2.5 cm³ of NaOH has been added.

But wait, maybe I should approach it in terms of moles. Let me think. The initial moles of acetic acid are 0.02 L × 0.05 M = 0.001 mol. So the equivalence point is when NaOH has added 0.001 mol. So 25% of that is 0.00025 mol of NaOH added.

So at 25% titration, 0.00025 mol NaOH has reacted. Since the reaction is CH3COOH + NaOH → CH3COO^- Na+ + H2O, the
