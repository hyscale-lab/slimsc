Okay, so I'm trying to solve this astronomy question about exoplanets detected using the radial velocity (RV) method. Let me think through this step by step.

The question says that there are two stars with the same mass as our Sun, and each has a planet with a mass similar to Neptune. Both planets are in circular orbits. The RV method measures the Doppler shift of the star's spectral lines due to the planet's gravitational pull.

Planet #1 causes a 5 milliangstrom shift, and Planet #2 causes a 7 milliangstrom shift. The question is asking how many times longer the orbital period of Planet #2 is compared to Planet #1.

Hmm, the RV method detects the velocity of the star's movement. The formula I remember for the semi-amplitude of the radial velocity (K) is something like K = ( (G * (M_p) ) / ( (M_* + M_p)^(1/3) * (1 year)^2 ) )^(1/3) ) * ( (P/(2π)) )^(-1/3) * (1/(1 + M_p/M_*))^(1/3) )

Wait, maybe that's too complicated. Another approach: the RV semi-amplitude K is proportional to (M_p sin i) / (M_*^(2/3) * (1 + M_p/M_*)^(1/3)) ) * (1/(P)^(1/3)) ). But since the planet masses are much smaller than the star's mass, M_* >> M_p, so 1 + M_p/M_* is approximately 1, and can be ignored for an approximation. So K is proportional to (M_p) / (M_*^(2/3) * P^(1/3)) )

Wait, the exact formula might be K = ( (G * P) / (2π c) )^(1/3) * (M_p sin i) / ( (M_* + M_p)^(2/3) ) )

But given that M_* is much larger than M_p, M_* + M_p ≈ M_*, so simplifying:

K ≈ ( (G P ) / (2π c) )^(1/3) * (M_p) / (M_*^(2/3) )

Wait, but I'm not sure I'm getting this right. Alternatively, I remember that K is inversely proportional to the cube root of the orbital period. Because the formula for K includes a term (P)^(-1/3). So if K is larger, the period is smaller?

Wait, let's think about what affects the RV velocity. A planet with a larger mass would cause a larger K. If the star is more massive, K decreases. And the period also affects it: longer periods would result in smaller K? Because the star moves more slowly when the planet is in a longer orbit.

But the question says both stars have the same mass as the Sun, and both planets have similar Neptune masses. So M_* is same, M_p is same. So the only varying factor is the orbital period.

So if K is inversely proportional to P^(1/3), then K ∝ 1/(P^(1/3)).

So for each planet, K1 = 5 mA, K2=7 mA. So K2/K1 = 7/5 = 1.4.

But wait, since K is inversely proportional to P^(1/3), then P ∝ 1/K^(3).

Wait, let me get this straight. Let me write the proportionality:

K ∝ 1/(P^(1/3))   [since other terms are same]

So rearranged, P ∝ 1/(K^3). Or, more accurately, P1/P2 = (K2/K1)^3.

Wait, no, because if K is inversely proportional to P^(1/3), then K1/K2 = (P2/P1)^(1/3). So (K1/K2) = (P2/P1)^(1/3). So (K1/K2)^3 = P2/P1.

But we're looking for P2 / P1. So if K1 is 5 and K2 is 7, then K1/K2 = 5/7. So cube that: (5/7)^3 = 125/343 ≈ 0.364.

So P2/P1 = 125/343 ≈ 0.364. Which would mean P2 is about 0.364 times P1, which is about 36% of P1. So the orbital period of planet #2 is shorter than planet #1. Wait, but the question is asking how many times longer is P2 than P1. If P2 is about 0.36 times P1, then it's shorter, not longer. So the answer would be approximately 0.36, which is option A.

Wait, but maybe I got the proportionality wrong. Let me double-check.

If K ∝ (M_p / (M_*^(2/3) * P^(1/3)) ), and M_p and M_* are same for both, then K is inversely proportional to P^(1/3). So K is larger when P is smaller.

So K2 = 7 mA, K1=5 mA. So K2 > K1 → P2 < P1.

So the ratio P2/P1 = (K1/K2)^3 = (5/7)^3 = 125/343 ≈ 0.364.

So P2 is about 0.36 times P1. So the question is, how many times longer is P2 than P1? It's shorter, so the ratio is less than 1. So the answer is 0.36. So option A.

Wait, but another thought: the RV method's semi-amplitude K is given by the formula:

K = (v) = ( (2π G) / (c P ) )^(1/3) * (M_p sin i) / ( (M_* + M_p)^(2/3) )

Assuming sin i ≈ 1 (edge-on orbit, which is often assumed for detected planets), and M_* >> M_p, so M_* + M_p ≈ M_*. Then K ≈ ( (2π G) / (c P) )^(1/3) * (M_p) / (M_*^(2/3) )

So the formula simplifies to K proportional to (M_p) / ( M_*^(2/3) P^(1/3) )

Since both M_p and M_* are same for both planets, K is inversely proportional to P^(1/3). So K ∝ 1 / P^(1/3) → P ∝ 1 / K^3.

Wait, no. Let's think about the relationship again.

If K1 is
