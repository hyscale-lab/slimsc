Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a relativistic harmonic oscillator. Hmm, I remember that in classical mechanics, a harmonic oscillator is a system where the restoring force is proportional to the displacement, like F = -kx. But this is the relativistic version, so I guess I have to consider how relativity affects the equations.

The question asks for the maximum speed of the mass. In the non-relativistic case, the maximum speed would be when all the potential energy is converted into kinetic energy. For a harmonic oscillator, potential energy at maximum displacement is (1/2)kA². So the kinetic energy would be (1/2)mv², and setting them equal gives v_max = sqrt(kA²/m). Looking at the options, option C is that, but I think that's the non-relativistic case. Since this is relativistic, the answer should be different.

Wait, but wait. Relativity comes into play when speeds are a significant fraction of the speed of light. So the harmonic oscillator's equations in relativity must involve modifications to account for relativistic effects, like using relativistic momentum or energy.

I remember that in special relativity, the total energy is gamma times mc², where gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²). And kinetic energy is (gamma - 1)mc². So perhaps the system's energy includes relativistic terms.

In the case of the harmonic oscillator, the potential energy is (1/2)kx², but in relativity, maybe the expression changes. Alternatively, perhaps the equation of motion is modified relativistically. Oh, right, the force law in relativity isn't F=ma, but F = d(p)/dt, where p is relativistic momentum, p = gamma mv.

So, the equation of motion would be F = -kx = d/dt (gamma mv). But this looks complicated. I'm not sure how to solve that directly.

Alternatively, maybe we can consider energy conservation. The total energy in the system is the sum of the potential and kinetic energy. In the maximum displacement (x=A), the kinetic energy is zero, so the total energy is (1/2)kA². But wait, that's the classical case. In the relativistic case, perhaps the potential energy isn't (1/2)kA² anymore? Or maybe the kinetic energy expression is modified.

Wait, actually, in the relativistic harmonic oscillator, the potential energy might still be (1/2)kx², but the kinetic energy is the relativistic form, which is (pc)^2 = (E_kinetic)^2 = (gamma m c² - m c²)^2. Wait, no, that's not exactly right. The kinetic energy is (gamma - 1) m c². So the total energy should be gamma m c² equals the sum of kinetic and potential energies.

Alternatively, maybe the system's energy is conserved in a way that when the oscillator is at x=0, the potential energy is zero, and all energy is kinetic. So at x=0, the velocity is maximum, and at x=A, velocity is zero, and potential is maximum.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Let me think again. The maximum speed occurs when the oscillator is passing through the equilibrium position (x=0), so at that point, all the energy is kinetic.

Wait, but in the non-relativistic case, total energy is (1/2)kA^2, and that equals (1/2)mv_max². So the maximum speed is sqrt(kA²/m), which is option C. But since this is relativistic, I need to adjust for that.

So in the relativistic case, the total energy at maximum displacement (x=A, v=0) would be the sum of rest mass energy and potential energy. Wait, but in the non-relativistic case, the potential energy is 1/2 k A², and kinetic is zero. So in relativity, perhaps the potential energy is still 1/2 k A², but the total energy is gamma m c², which equals the potential energy plus the kinetic energy.

Wait, but when the oscillator is at x=A, the velocity is zero, so kinetic energy is zero. So the total energy would be the rest energy plus potential energy. But wait, in relativity, the potential energy might contribute to the total energy. So at x=A, the system's total energy is 1/2 k A² plus rest energy, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the energy equation is E_total = gamma m c² = (1/2)k A² + (1/2) m v². But wait, that's mixing relativistic and non-relativistic terms. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to write the energy as a function of velocity and set it equal to the potential energy at maximum displacement.

So, when the oscillator is at x = A, velocity v = 0, so all energy is potential. And when it's at x=0, velocity is maximum, so all energy is kinetic.

But wait, in the relativistic case, the total energy includes the rest mass energy. So perhaps the maximum speed occurs when the kinetic energy plus rest energy equals the potential energy at maximum displacement.

Wait, that might not make sense. Let's think again. The total energy of the oscillator is conserved, so when it's at x=A, the energy is all potential energy, so E = (1/2)k A² + mc². Because at x=A, the velocity is zero, so kinetic energy is zero, but rest energy is still there. Or is that right? Because in the non-relativistic case, the rest energy doesn't play a role, but in relativity, it does.

Wait, no. Because the rest energy is always present. So when the oscillator is at x=A, the total energy is (1/2)k A² plus the rest energy mc². So the total energy is E = (1/2)k A² + mc².

Then, when the oscillator is at x=0, all the energy is kinetic. So kinetic energy KE = E - mc². Because E includes mc² as the rest energy.

Wait, but in relativity, KE is (gamma - 1) mc². So E = gamma mc² = KE + mc² = (gamma -1) mc² + mc² = gamma mc².

So, setting E = (1/2)k A² + mc² = gamma mc². So, (1/2)k A² = (gamma - 1) mc².

So, gamma = 1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²).

Gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v^2/c²), so 1/sqrt(1 - (v_max)^2/c²) = 1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²).

Let me denote (k A²)/(2 m c²) as a term, let's say, term = (k A²)/(2 m c²).

So 1/sqrt(1 - v^2/c²) = 1 + term.

Let me square both sides: 1/(1 - v^2/c²) = (1 + term)^2.

So 1 - v^2/c² = 1/(1 + term)^2.

So v^2/c² = 1 - 1/(1 + term)^2.

Let me calculate this:

v_max^2 = c² [ 1 - 1/(1 + term)^2 ]

= c² [ ( (1 + term)^2 - 1 ) / (1 + term)^2 )

Expanding (1 + term)^2: 1 + 2 term + term².

So numerator: 1 + 2 term + term² -1 = 2 term + term².

So v_max^2 = c² (2 term + term²) / (1 + term)^2.

Hmm, let me plug term = (k A²)/(2 m c²) into this.

So term = (k A²)/(2 m c^2) = let's say T for short.

So v_max^2 = c² (2T + T^2) / (1 + T)^2.
