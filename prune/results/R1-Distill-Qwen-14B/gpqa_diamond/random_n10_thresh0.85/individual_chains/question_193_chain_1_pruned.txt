Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here. Hmm, let me read it again. The question says that in a specific region of the sky, the number of stars varies with parallax as 1 over parallax to the fifth power. So like, N ∝ 1/plx^5. And the question is asking how the number of stars changes with distance, per unit range of distance r. The options are A to D, each with different exponents.

Wait, I'm a bit rusty on my astronomy here, but I remember parallax is related to distance. Parallax (plx) is the apparent shift in position of a star as seen from Earth due to our orbit around the Sun. The formula I remember is that distance (d) in parsecs is approximately 1 divided by the parallax in arcseconds. So d = 1/plx. So that means plx is inversely proportional to d, right? So plx = 1/d.

So the given relation is N ∝ 1/(plx)^5. Since plx is 1/d, I can substitute that in. Let's see: 1/( (1/d) )^5. That would be 1 divided by (1^5 / d^5), which is the same as d^5 / 1. So 1/(plx)^5 becomes d^5. So N ∝ d^5.

Wait, but the question is about how the number of stars changes with distance, per unit range. So if N is proportional to d^5, then at a given distance, more stars are present. But how does the number change as we move along the distance? Like, for each small increase in r (distance), how does the number of stars change?

Wait, maybe I should think in terms of differential. Because the question is about the change per unit range of distance r. So if N is proportional to d^5, then the number of stars in a thin shell of radius d and thickness dr would be proportional to d^5 times dr? Hmm, wait, but wait, the number of stars in a region depends on the volume, but the way the problem is stated, it's a specific region, so maybe it's a differential in the number of stars with distance.

Alternatively, maybe the number of stars is a function of distance, and they're asking about the variation. So if N is proportional to (d)^5, then the rate of change of N with respect to d is dN/dd = 5d^4. But that seems like the slope, but the question is about how the number of stars changes with distance per unit range. Hmm, maybe I'm over
