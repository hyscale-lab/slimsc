Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question is about.

The problem says we have a solution with Co(II) ions and thiocyanate (SCN-). The total cobalt concentration is 1e-2 M, and the SCN- concentration is 0.1 M. The stability constants for the cobalt thiocyanato complexes are given as β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, and β4=16. The question is asking for the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes among all cobalt-containing species. The options are from A to D.

Hmm. So, I think the key here is to understand the stability of the different complexes and determine which one is dominant. The blue dithiocyanato complex probably refers to a specific complex, maybe the [Co(SCN)_n]^m+ with n=2 or another number. Wait, but the options given are percentages, so maybe the problem is about the fraction of Co in each possible complex.

Stability constants (β) tell us about the stability of the complex ions. Higher β means the complex is more stable. Stability constants usually are for the formation of the complex step-wise or overall.

Wait, the stability constants given are β1 to β4. So, I think each β corresponds to the formation of a different complex. Let me think: for a metal ion, the complexes can form stepwise. For example, Co^2+ can form [Co(SCN)]^+, [Co(SCN)_2]^0, [Co(SCN)_3]^-, and [Co(SCN)_4]^2- as the four complexes, each with their own stability constant.

The stability constant (β) is the equilibrium constant for the formation of the complex. So, the overall formation constant (if considering all steps) would be the product of the step-wise β's. But wait, the question gives each β as the stability constant for each complex. Or perhaps each β represents the formation of each successive complex. I'm a bit confused here.

Wait, the problem statement says the stability constants are β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, and β4=16. So, probably, each β is the formation constant for adding one SCN- each time. So, for example:

Co^2+ + SCN- ↔ [Co(SCN)]^+ → β1 =9

[Co(SCN)]^+ + SCN- ↔ [Co(SCN)_2]^0 → β2=40

[Co(SCN)_2]^0 + SCN- ↔ [Co(SCN)_3]^- → β3=63

[Co(SCN)_3]^- + SCN- ↔ [Co(SCN)_4]^{2-} → β4=16

But wait, that can't be right because β4 is lower than β3. So the complexes might not form beyond a certain point. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps these β values are the overall formation constants for each complex. So β1 is the formation constant for [CoSCN]^+, β2 for [Co(SCN)_2]^0, etc.

Alternatively, perhaps the β's are sequential, so the overall K for the nth complex is the product up to βn. So, for example, the formation constant for [Co(SCN)_n] would be K_n = β1 * β2 * ... * βn.

Wait, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Another approach: the fraction of each complex in solution can be determined using the stability constants and the concentrations of the ions.

The general approach for such problems is to calculate the fraction (or mole fraction) of each possible complex, then sum them up to get the total, and find the percentage for the desired complex.

But how do I calculate these fractions?

The fraction of a particular complex depends on the logarithm of the product of the stability constants divided by the product of the concentrations of the ligand raised to the appropriate power, and so on. There's a formula for that.

Wait, I think the fraction f_n of the complex [Co(SCN)_n]^{m} can be calculated using the formula:

f_n = (β1 * β2 * ... * βn) * [SCN-]^n / (1 + sum_{k=1 to 4} (β1β2...βk) [SCN-]^k )

Wait, that seems plausible. Because the denominator is the sum of all possible complexes plus the free Co^2+.

Wait, but wait, the total concentration of cobalt includes all the species: Co^2+, [CoSCN]^+, [Co(SCN)_2]^0, [Co(SCN)_3]^-, [Co(SCN)_4]^{2-}.

So the total [Co] is the sum of each complex's concentration.

Each complex's concentration is [Co(SCN)_n] = K_n * [Co^2+] [SCN-]^n, where K_n is the product of the β's up to n.

But since [Co^2+] is related to the total concentration, perhaps I can model it using the total cobalt concentration.

Alternatively, considering that the total cobalt concentration is c_total = [Co^2+] + [CoSCN]^+ + [Co(SCN)_2]^0 + [Co(SCN)_3}^- + [Co(SCN)_4]^{2-}.

So, if I let [Co^2+] = x, then each complex's concentration can be expressed in terms of x.

For example:

[CoSCN]^+ = β1 * x * [SCN-] = β1 * x * s (where s is [SCN-] = 0.1 M)

[Co(SCN)_2]^0 = β2 * [CoSCN]^+ * [SCN-] = β1 * β2 * x * s^2

Wait, no, perhaps better to model each complex as K_n = β1*β2*...*βn.

So, [Co(SCN)_n] = K_n * x * s^n

But wait, I think that's the case for the nth complex. So the concentration of each complex is given by K_n * x * s^n, where K_n is the product of the β's up to n.

So, the total cobalt is:

x + K1 x s + K2 x s^2 + K3 x s^3 + K4 x s^4 = c_total

Where K1 = β1, K2 = β1 β2, K3 = β1 β2 β3, K4 = β1 β2 β3 β4.

But wait, K4 would be β1*β2*β3*β4. Let me compute these K values.

Given β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16.

So,

K1 = 9

K2 = 9 *40 = 360

K3 = 9*40*63= 9*40=360, 360*63=22680

K4= 9*40*63*16= let's compute: 9*40=360, 360 *63=22680, 22680 *16 = 362880.

So, K1=9, K2=360, K3=22680, K4=362880.

The total [Co] is:

x + (9 x s) + (360 x s^2) + (22680 x s^3) + (362880 x s^4) = 1e-2 M.

But s is given as 0.1 M.

So s=0.1, s^2=0.01, s^3=0.001, s^4=0.0001.

Substituting:

x + 9x*(0.1) + 360x*(0.01) + 22680x*(0.001) + 362880x*(0.0001) = 1e-2.

Let me compute each term:

Term1: x

Term2: 9x * 0.1 = 0.9x

Term3: 360x *0.01 = 3.6x

Term4:22680x *0.001=22.68x

Term5:362880x *0.0001=36.288x

Adding all terms:

x + 0.9x = 1.9x

1.9x +3.6x=5.5x

5.5x +22.68x=28.18x

28.18x +36.288x=64.468x

So,

64.468 x = 1e-2

x = (1e-2) / 64.468 ≈ 1.551e-4 M.

So [Co^2+] is approximately 1.551e-4 M.

Now, to find the concentration of each complex:

[CoSCN]^+ = K1 x s =9 *1.551e-4 *0.1 = 9 *1.551e-5 = approx 1.396e-4 M.

[Co(SCN)_2]^0 = K2 x s^2 =360 *1.551e-4 * (0.1)^2 → 360 *1.551e-4 *0.01 =360 *1.551e-6 = 5.5836e-4 M.

[Co(SCN)_3}^- = K3 x s^3 =22680 *1.551e-4 * (0.1)^3 → 22680 *1.551e-4 * 0.001 =22680 *1.551e-7 = approximately 3.518e-3 M.

[Co(SCN)_4]^{2-} = K4 x s^4 =362880 *1.551e-4 * (0.1)^4 → 362880 *1.551e-4 * 0.0001 =362880 *1.551e-8 → approx 5.624e-3 M.

Wait, let me compute each one more accurately.

Compute each term:

[Co^2+] =x ≈ 1.551e-4 M

[CoSCN]^+ =9 *1.551e-4 *0.1 = 9 *1.551e-5 =1.3959e-4 M

[Co(SCN)_2]^0 =360 *1.551e-4 *0.01 =360 *1.551e-6 =5.5836e-4 M

[Co(SCN)_3}^- =22680 *1.551e-4 *0.001 =22680 *1.551e-7 = approx 3.518e-3 M.

Wait, 22680 * 1.551e-7 → 22680 = 2.268e4 → 2.268e4 *1.551e-7 = (2.268 *1.551) *1e-3 → approx 3.517e-3.

[Co(SCN)_4]^{2-} =362880 *1.551e-4 *0.0001 → 362880 =3.6288e5 → 3.6288e5 *1.551e-4 = 3.6288 *1.551 *1e1 → approx 5.624e1 *1e1? Wait, no.

Wait, 362880 *1.551e-4 = 3.6288e5 *1.551e-4 = (3.6288 *1.551) *1e1 → 5.624 *1e1 =56.24. Then multiply by 0.0001 (from s^4=0.1^4=1e-4), so 56.24 *1e-4 =5.624e-3 M.

So, all the concentrations:

[Co^2+] =1.551e-4 → ~0.000155 M

[CoSCN]^+ = ~0.0001396 M

[Co(SCN)_2]^0 → ~0.000558 M

[Co(SCN)_3}^- → ~0.003518 M

[Co(SCN)_4]^{2-} → ~0.005624 M

Wait, let me sum them up to make sure they add up to 0.01 M.

Sum:

0.0001551 (x)

+0.0001396 → sum so far 0.0002947

+0.000558 → sum 0.0008527

+0.003518 → sum 0.0043707

+0.005624 → sum 0.0099947 ≈ 0.01 M. Close enough, considering rounding.

So now, we need to find the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato complex. Wait, the question specifies "the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes." Dithiocyanato would imply two SCN- ligands. So the complex [Co(SCN)_2]^0.

So the concentration of this complex is about 0.000558 M.

The total cobalt concentration is 0.01 M, so the fraction is 0.000558 / 0.01 = 0.0558 or 5.58%. Hmm, but none of the options are close to that. The options are A)42.3%, B)25.6%, C)38.1%, D)16.9%.

Wait, that's way off. Did I make a mistake here?

Wait wait, perhaps I got the definition of the β's wrong. Maybe the β's are not the step-wise formation constants but the overall formation constants for each complex.

Alternatively, perhaps each β represents the overall formation constant for each complex, not the step-wise.

Wait, another approach: the general formula for the fraction of a particular complex is:

f_n = (β1 β2 ... βn [SCN-]^n) / (1 + β1 [SCN-] + β1 β2 [SCN-]^2 + ... + β1 β2 ...βn [SCN-]^n )

Wait, but wait, that's not quite right. Because each β is a step-wise constant, but perhaps the overall K for the nth complex is the product of β1 to βn. So the fraction of the nth complex is (K_n [SCN-]^n) / (sum_{k=0 to 4} K_k [SCN-]^k ), where K_0=1.

Wait, in that case, the denominator would be 1 + β1 s + β1β2 s^2 + β1β2β3 s^3 + β1β2β3β4 s^4.

Wait, let me re-calculate using this approach.

Let me compute the numerator and denominator for each complex.

But wait, the question is about the blue dithiocyanato complex, which I think is the [Co(SCN)_2]^0 complex, which is the second complex, with n=2.

So, let's compute the fraction f_2 for [Co(SCN)_2]^0.

Compute each term:

K_0 = 1

K_1 = β1 =9

K_2 = β1 β2 = 9*40=360

K_3 =9*40*63=22680

K_4=9*40*63*16=362880.

Now, s=0.1 M.

Compute denominator D=1 + K1 s + K2 s^2 + K3 s^3 + K4 s^4.

Compute each term:

K1 s =9 *0.1=0.9

K2 s^2=360*(0.1)^2=360*0.01=3.6

K3 s^3=22680*(0.1)^3=22680*0.001=22.68

K4 s^4=362880*(0.1)^4=362880*0.0001=36.288

So D =1 +0.9 +3.6 +22.68 +36.288= 1+0.9=1.9; +3.6=5.5; +22.68=28.18; +36.288=64.468.

The numerator for f_2 is K2 s^2 =360 * (0.1)^2=360 *0.01=3.6.

So f_2=3.6 / 64.468 ≈0.0557, or 5.57%.

Again, this is about 5.57%, but the options don't have this. So I'm missing something here.

Wait, perhaps the problem is about dithiocyanato, which is a different structure. Alternatively, perhaps the 'blue' complex is a different one, maybe the tetrathiocyanato complex. Or perhaps I've misunderstood which complex is being referred to.

Alternatively, perhaps the 'blue' refers to the [Co(SCN)_4]^{2-} complex, which is the most stable because it has the highest product of β's.

Wait, let's compute the fraction for each complex and see which one matches the options.

So calculate f_1, f_2, f_3, f_4.

f_1 = K1 s/(D) = 0.9/64.468≈ 0.014, 1.4%

f_2=3.6/64.468≈5.57%

f_3=22.68 /64.468≈35.18%

f_4=36.288 /64.468≈56.27%

Wait, f_3 is about 35%, f_4 about 56%. Hmm. None of these directly match the options. Wait, the options are A)42.3%, B)25.6%, C)38.1%, D)16.9%.

Hmm, none of these are 35% or 56%. So perhaps I made a wrong assumption.

Wait, perhaps the problem refers to the di- as in two thiocyanate ligands, so [Co(SCN)_2]^0. But according to the fraction, that's about 5.57%, which isn't an option.

Alternatively, perhaps the β's are given as the overall stability constants for each complex, not the step-wise. So for [Co(SCN)]^+, [Co(SCN)_2]^0, [Co(SCN)_3}^-, and [Co(SCN)_4]^{2-}, the β's are the overall formation constants. That is, β1 is the formation constant for [CoSCN]^+, β2 for [Co(SCN)_2]^0, etc. In that case, the approach would be different.

Wait, but I thought that's the case earlier, but I must have made a mistake. Let me try this approach.

If the β's are the overall formation constants, then:

For [Co(SCN)]^+, K1=β1=9.

For [Co(SCN)_2]^0, K2=β2=40.

For [Co(SCN)_3}^-, K3=β3=63.

For [Co(SCN)_4]^{2-}, K4=β4=16.

So each K is the formation constant for each complex.

In this case, [Co(SCN)_n] = K_n [Co^2+] [SCN-]^n.

But wait, for K2, the formation of [Co(SCN)_2]^0 would be a two-step process, and the overall K would be K1*K2. Hmm, no.

Wait, no. The overall formation constant for [Co(SCN)_n] is the product of the individual step-wise β's. So if each β is the step-wise constant, then the overall K for [CoSCN]^+ is β1, for [Co(SCN)_2]^0 it's β1*beta2, etc.

But if the given βs
