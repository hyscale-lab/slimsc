Okay, so I'm trying to figure out the energy of the RHIC when the speed of the nucleus X is 0.96c. Hmm, nucleus X is Li with 3 neutrons. Wait, Li usually has 3 protons. If it's Li with 3 neutrons, that makes it Li-6, right? Because Li typically has 3 protons and 3 neutrons would make it Li-6. So the mass number A is 6.

I remember that in particle physics, the energy of a relativistic particle isn't just the kinetic energy but the total energy, which includes rest mass and kinetic. But wait, the question asks for the energy of the collider, which probably refers to the total energy each ion has. So maybe I need to calculate the total relativistic energy.

The formula for relativistic energy is E = gamma * m0 * c². Gamma is the Lorentz factor, which is 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²). Since the speed v is 0.96c, I can plug that in.

Let me compute gamma first. So v = 0.96c. So v² = (0.96)^2 c². Let me calculate 0.96 squared. 0.96 * 0.96 is 0.9216. So 1 - v²/c² is 1 - 0.9216 = 0.0784. Then the square root of that is sqrt(0.0784). Hmm, sqrt(0.0784) is 0.28 because 0.28² is 0.0784. So gamma is 1 / 0.28, which is approximately 3.57142857...

Wait, let me compute that accurately. 0.28 squared is 0.0784, correct. So 1/0.28 is approx 3.57142857. Hmm, okay.

Now, the mass m0 is the rest mass of the Li-6 nucleus. I think the mass of a single nucleon (proton or neutron) is about 938 MeV/c². So Li-6 has 6 nucleons. So m0 = 6 * 938 MeV/c². Let me calculate that. 6 * 938 = 5628 MeV. Wait, but 938 MeV is 0.938 GeV. So 6 * 0.938 GeV is 5.628 GeV. So m0 c² is 5.628 GeV.

Wait, no, wait. Wait, the rest energy of each nucleon is about 938 MeV, so yes, for Li-6, it's 6 * 938 MeV = 5628 MeV, which is 5.628 GeV.

So E = gamma * m0 c² = 3.57142857 * 5.628 GeV. Let me compute that. 

3.5714 * 5.628. Let's see:

First, 3 * 5.628 = 16.884.

0.5714 * 5.628. Let me compute that step by step. 0.5 *5.628=2.814, 0.0714 *5.628 ≈ 0.4044. So adding 2.814 + 0.4044 gives about 3.2184.

So 3.5714 *5.628 ≈ 16.884 +3.2184 = 20.1024 GeV. Wait, but wait, more accurately. Let me think.

Alternatively, maybe I should compute 3.57142857 *5.628.

Break it down:

3.57142857 *5 = 17.85714285

3.57142857 *0.6 = 2.14285714

3.57142857 *0.028 = approx 0.100 (since 3.57142857 *0.02 is 0.07142857, and 0.008 is 0.028571428, adding to 0.099999998, roughly 0.100).

So adding 17.85714285 + 2.14285714 = 20.0, plus 0.1 → 20.1 GeV.

Wait, but wait, that's probably an approximation. Let me use a calculator approach.

3.57142857 *5.628 = ?

Let me multiply 3.57142857 by 5.628 step by step.

First, 3 *5.628 = 16.884.

Then 0.57142857 *5.628.

0.5 *5.628 = 2.814.

0.07142857 *5.628 = let's compute 5.628 * 0.07 = 0.394, 5.628 *0.00142857 ≈ 0.008. So approx 0.394 +0.008=0.402.

So 0.57142857 *5.628 ≈ 2.814 +0.402=3.216.

So total is 16.884 + 3.216 = 20.1 GeV.

Wait, but wait, maybe I should be more precise because the options are precise to four decimal places.

Alternative approach: compute gamma more accurately.

v = 0.96c.

Beta = v/c = 0.96.

Gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - beta²) = 1/sqrt(1 - 0.96²).

0.96^2 is 0.9216.

1 - 0.9216 = 0.0784.

sqrt(0.0784)=0.28 exactly,
