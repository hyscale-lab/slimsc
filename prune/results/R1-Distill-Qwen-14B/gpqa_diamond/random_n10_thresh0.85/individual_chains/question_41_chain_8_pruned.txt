Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about light moving through glass when the glass itself is moving. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's try to think it through.

The question says a light beam is propagating through a glass with index of refraction n. The glass is moving at a constant velocity v in the same direction as the beam and toward the observer in the lab. We need to find the speed of light in the glass relative to the observer.

Wait, wait. So the glass is moving towards the observer. But the light is moving in the same direction as the glass. So the glass is moving, say, to the right, and the light is also moving to the right. But the observer is in the lab, which is stationary, I assume.

I remember that the speed of light in a medium is c/n, where c is the vacuum speed and n is the refractive index. So in the rest frame of the glass, the speed of light is c/n. But since the glass itself is moving, we have to consider how velocities add up when moving between frames.

Wait, this sounds like a problem involving the addition of velocities from special relativity. Because the glass is moving relative to the lab frame. But wait, light is moving in the same direction as the glass's motion. So in the lab frame, what's the speed of the light?

Alternatively, maybe it's simpler than that. Because the speed of light in a medium is always c/n, regardless of the motion of the medium. Or does the motion of the medium affect it?

Wait, but in the lab frame, the glass is moving. So maybe we need to apply the velocity addition formula. But I'm a bit confused.

Let me think: in the glass's rest frame, the light is moving at c/n. But the glass's frame is moving at velocity v relative to the lab frame.

Wait, no, the glass is moving in the same direction as the light. So perhaps the light's velocity relative to the lab is the sum of the glass's velocity and the light's velocity in the glass's frame.

But that can't be right because velocities don't just add up linearly in relativity. Wait, but the speeds are probably non-relativistic here because v is small compared to c. Or maybe not. The problem doesn't specify that v is small, so I can't assume that.

Wait, but in reality, the speed of light in a medium is dependent on the medium's motion. Or is it?

Oh wait, no. The speed of light
