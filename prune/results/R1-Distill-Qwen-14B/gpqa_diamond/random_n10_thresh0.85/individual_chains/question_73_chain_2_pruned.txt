Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds, and I need to find their relative speed and the total energy of the system. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.

First, the problem states that two astronauts have masses 2m and 3m, traveling at 0.6c and 0.5c respectively in the positive x-direction. I remember that when dealing with speeds close to the speed of light, I can't just use classical mechanics; I need to use special relativity principles.

Wait, the question is asking for two things: the relative speed between them and the total energy of the system. Let me handle each part separately.

Starting with the relative speed. I think in relativity, the way to find the relative velocity between two objects isn't just subtracting their speeds. Oh right, the formula for relative velocity in special relativity is different. The formula is (v1 - v2)/(1 - (v1*v2)/(c²)). Because the speed of light is a maximum, you can't just add or subtract them as in classical mechanics.

So, astronaut 1 is moving at 0.6c, astronaut 2 at 0.5c. Wait, but are they moving in the same direction? The problem says both are in the positive x-direction, so yes. So astronaut 1 is ahead in the direction of motion because 0.6c is bigger than 0.5c. So, from astronaut 2's frame, what is the speed of astronaut 1?

Wait, actually, I think it's the other way around. Because if astronaut 1 is moving at 0.6c and astronaut 2 at 0.5c, then the relative speed of astronaut 1 with respect to astronaut 2 would be (0.6c - 0.5c)/(1 - (0.6c * 0.5c)/c²). Let me compute that.

So numerator: 0.1c. Denominator: 1 - (0.3c²)/c² = 1 - 0.3 = 0.7. So 0.1c / 0.7 = (1/7)*c ≈ 0.1428c. So approximately 0.14c. Looking at the options, options C and D have v_rel around 0.14c. So that's a clue.

Now, the second part: the total energy of the system. In relativity, the total energy includes rest mass energy and kinetic energy. Each astronaut's total energy would be gamma multiplied by their rest mass energy. So for each, I calculate gamma and then multiply by mc².

Wait, but since they're moving relative to each other, do I need to consider their energies from a common frame? Or is the total energy simply the sum of their energies in their rest frames? Hmm, no, I think the problem is asking for the total energy of the system as measured in a frame where, perhaps, one astronaut is stationary. Or maybe in the center-of-momentum frame? Hmm, the question isn't entirely clear, but I'm guessing it's just the sum of their energies in the same frame.

Wait, but wait. Let me read the question again. It says, "the total energy
