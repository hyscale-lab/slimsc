Okay, so I'm trying to solve this physics problem about relativistic speeds and energies for two astronauts. Let me see what I remember from my classes.

The problem says there are two astronauts with masses 2m and 3m moving at 0.6c and 0.5c respectively in the positive x-direction. We need to find their relative speed and the total energy of the system.

Hmm, relative speed in relativity isn't just a simple subtraction. I think I remember that you can't just say v_rel = 0.6c - 0.5c = 0.1c because that's non-relativistic thinking. Oh right, you have to use the velocity addition formula from special relativity.

The formula for relative velocity when two objects are moving along the same direction is (u - v)/(1 - (uv)/(c²)). So here, u is 0.6c and v is 0.5c. Let me plug those in.

Wait, wait. No, actually, the formula is (u - v)/(1 - (u v)/(c²)). So u is the velocity of the first object as seen from the second's frame, right? Or is it the other way around? Wait, no, when calculating relative velocity, if one frame is moving at u and the other at v, then the relative speed would be (u - v)/(1 - (u v)/(c²)).

So plugging in, u = 0.6c, v=0.5c. So numerator is 0.6c - 0.5c = 0.1c. Denominator is 1 - (0.6c * 0.5c)/(c²). Let's compute that. The denominator becomes 1 - (0.3 c²)/(c²) = 1 - 0.3 = 0.7.

So the relative speed is (0.1c) / 0.7 = (0.1/0.7)c ≈ 0.1428c. So that's approximately 0.14c. Looking at the options, option C and D have 0.14c as the relative speed. So the relative speed part would narrow it down to options C and D.

Now, the total energy part. Each astronaut's energy is their relativistic energy, which is gamma times m c squared. So for the first astronaut, mass 2m moving at 0.6c, gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - (0.6)^2) = 1/sqrt(1 - 0.36) = 1/sqrt(0.64) = 1/0.8 = 1.25. So energy is 1.25 * 2m c² = 2.5 m c².

Wait, wait, no. Gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - (v²/c²)). So for 0.6c, that's 1/sqrt(1 - 0.36) = 1/sqrt(0.64) = 1.25. So yes, 1.25 * 2m c² is 2.5 mc² for the first astronaut.

Second astronaut's mass is 3m moving
