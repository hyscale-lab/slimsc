Okay, so I've got this question about how the number of stars per unit range of parallax changes with the parallax value. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's think it through.

First, I remember that parallax (plx) is related to the distance of a star. The formula is distance (d) in parsecs is 1 over plx (d = 1/plx). Oh right, because parallax is the reciprocal of distance. So as plx increases, the distance decreases, and vice versa.

Now, the question is about the number of stars per unit of plx. Since stars are uniformly distributed, I guess that means their distribution in space is uniform. So the number density of stars is the same in all regions, right?

Wait, but how does that translate when we look at parallax? Because when you change the parallax, you're looking at a different volume of space. I think I need to relate the number of stars to the volume they occupy.

Let me think about the volume in terms of parallax. If I take a thin shell at a certain distance d, the volume of that shell would be the surface area of a sphere with radius d multiplied by the thickness (which is a small change in d). The surface area is 4πd², and if the thickness is dd, then the volume is 4πd² dd. 

But wait, since d = 1/plx, let's express everything in terms of plx. So d = 1/p, where p is the parallax. Then, dd is the change in d, which would be - (1/p²) dp because d = 1/p. So the volume becomes 4π(1/p)^2 * ( - (1/p²) dp ). Wait, but the negative sign just indicates direction; since we're dealing with a small range, maybe I can ignore it for now.

So, the volume element in terms of p is 4π/(p^4) dp. Because 4π*(1/p^2) * (1/p² dp) = 4π/(p^4) dp.

Now, since the number density of stars is uniform, the number of stars in that volume would be the volume multiplied by the number density (n). Let's say n is the number of stars per unit volume. So the number of stars in a volume dV is n * dV.

Putting it together, the number of stars per unit change in parallax (dp) is n * [4π/(p^4) dp]. But I think the question is asking for the number per unit range of plx, so perhaps we take the derivative, which would be the number per unit dp. Wait, no, because dp is the unit range. Hmm.

Wait, let me rephrase that. The number of stars with parallax between p and p+dp would be n * 4π/(p^4) dp. So the number per unit dp would be proportional to 1/p^4. Because the 4π and n are constants here.

So, the number decreases as p increases, but how exactly? It's proportional to 1/p^4.

Wait, but let me double-check. Are there other factors? Like, are we considering all stars up to a certain distance, or just within a thin shell?

In any case, when you have a uniform density of stars, the number in a thin shell at distance d is proportional to the surface area (4πd²) times the thickness (dd). But since d is 1/p, the surface area becomes 4π (1/p)^2, and the thickness in terms of p is (dp)/(p²), because dd = -1/p² dp. So when you multiply them together, you get 4π (1/p²) * (1/p²) dp = 4π/(p^4) dp. So yeah, the number per unit p is proportional to 1/p^4.

Looking back at the options, option A is 1/plx^4. So that's the one.


To determine how the number of stars per unit range of parallax (plx) changes with plx, we start by noting that parallax \( p \) is inversely related to distance \( d \) as \( d = \frac{1}{p} \). Since stars are uniformly distributed, the number density of stars is constant. 

The number of stars in a thin shell at distance \( d \) depends on the volume of the shell, which is proportional to the surface area of the sphere (\( 4\pi d^2 \)) multiplied by the thickness of the shell (\( dd \)). Substituting \( d = \frac{1}{p} \), the surface area becomes \( 4\pi \left(\frac{1}{p}\right)^2 \), and the thickness \( dd \) in terms of \( p \) is \( -\frac{1}{p^2} dp \). The volume element in terms of \( p \) is therefore:

\[
dV = 4\pi \left(\frac{1}{p}\right)^2 \left(-\frac{1}{p^2} dp\right) = \frac{4\pi}{p^4} dp.
\]

The number of stars in this volume is proportional to the number density of stars multiplied by \( dV \), giving:

\[
\text{Number of stars per unit } dp \propto \frac{1}{p^4}.
\]

Thus, the number of stars per unit range of parallax decreases as \( \frac{1}{p^4} \). Comparing this result with the options provided, the correct answer is:

**A) ~ 1/plx^4**
