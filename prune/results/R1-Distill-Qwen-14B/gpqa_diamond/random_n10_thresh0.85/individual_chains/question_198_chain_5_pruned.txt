Okay, so I'm trying to solve this chemistry problem. It's about the formation of cobalt complexes with thiocyanate ions. Hmm, I remember that stability constants (beta) are involved here. The question is about finding the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes among all cobalt species.

Let me read the problem again. We have a solution with Co(II) ions and thiocyanate. The total cobalt concentration is 0.01 M, and the SCN- concentration is 0.1 M. The stability constants are given as β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16. Wait, stability constants usually increase with the number of ligands attached, right? But here, β4 is lower than β3. That might be a typo, or maybe the complexes have different structures. Hmm, maybe β4 refers to a different complex, not necessarily a four-ligand one.

The question asks for the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato complexes. I think dithiocyanato would mean two SCN- ligands attached. So that's the Co(SCN)_2^2+ complex, which would be the species with two ligands. So the stability constant β2 is 40. But wait, I should check if the blue color is associated with a specific complex. Wait, I remember that the [Co(SCN)_4]^2- complex is blue. Oh wait, wait, no. I think [Co(SCN)_2]^+ is blue and [Co(SCN)_4]^3- is maybe another color. Wait, maybe I got that wrong. The problem says "dithiocyanato," which is two SCN ligands. So the complex would be [Co(SCN)_2]^2+ or something else. Hmm, perhaps I need to clarify this.

Wait, let me think: in solution, Co^2+ can form complexes with SCN- in varying degrees. The complexes are [Co(SCN)_n]^{2 -n}, I think. So for n=1, it's [CoSCN]^+, n=2 would be [Co(SCN)_2]^0? Or wait, perhaps I should double-check. Co^2+ with SCN- (which is -1 each) would have the formula [Co(SCN)_n]^{2 - n}, since each SCN- contributes -1. So for n=1, [CoSCN]^+ (charge 2+ +1*(-1) = +1). For n=2, [Co(SCN)_2]^0 (charge 2+ + 2*(-1) = 0). For n=3, [Co(SCN)_3]^- (2+ -3= -1). For n=4, [Co(SCN)_4]^2- (2+ -4= -2). 

But the question is about dithiocyanato complexes, which are n=2. So the species is [Co(SCN)_2]^0. But wait, I'm not entirely sure about the charge. Maybe I should proceed with the math and see.

The stability constants are given as β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16. So the stability constant for each complex is the formation constant: [Co(SCN)_n]/[Co][SCN]^n. So for n=1, β1=9, n=2, β2=40, etc.

We need to find the fraction of [Co(SCN)_2] in the solution. But wait, wait, the problem mentions "blue dithiocyanato" complexes. I think the blue color might correspond to another complex, perhaps [Co(SCN)_4]^2-? Because I remember that the tetraaquo or thiocyanato complexes can have different colors. Wait, I might be mixing things up. Let's see, I think the [Co(SCN)_4]^3- is the blue one, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe [Co(SCN)_2]^2+ is blue. Hmm, I'm a bit confused.
