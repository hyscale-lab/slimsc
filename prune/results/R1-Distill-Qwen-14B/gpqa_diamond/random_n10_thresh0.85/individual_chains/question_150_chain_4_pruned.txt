Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem to solve. Let me read through it again and try to figure it out step by step.

The compound has the molecular formula C8H9NO. Hmm, what does that tell me? Let's calculate the degree of unsaturation. Degree of unsaturation is (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. Wait, the formula is C8H9NO. So C is 8, H is 9, N is 1, O is 1.

So plugging in: (2*8 +2 -9 -0 +1)/2. Let's compute that. 2*8 is 16 +2 is 18, minus 9 is 9, plus 1 is 10. 10 divided by 2 is 5. So five degrees of unsaturation. That could be a ring and some double bonds or something like that. 

Looking at the NMR data: 9.72 ppm (t, 1H). High ppm like that often indicates an aldehyde proton, but wait, aldehydes are usually around 9-10, but they are usually a singlet. But this is a triplet. Hmm, that's a bit confusing. Alternatively, maybe it's a vinylogous aldehyde or something else. Or maybe an acidic proton like from an enol or something.

Then there's 6.98 ppm (d, 2H), 6.51 (d, 2H), 6.27 (bs, 2H), and 3.66 (d, 2H). Let me think about what these might correspond to. The doublets around 6.98 and 6.51 might be from aromatic protons. Maybe two sets of doublets indicating substitution on a benzene ring. The 6.27 as a broad singlet for 2H—could that be some kind of enol or conjugated system? And 3.66 as a d, 2H—maybe adjacent to an electronegative atom, like an oxygen.

Wait, the molecular formula has an O and an N. So maybe it's a nitro group or an amide or something. Let me think about the reagents. The reaction steps are:

1. NaNO2 + HCl. That's usually for diazotization, which is used in reactions like the Sandmeyer reaction. So maybe the compound has an amino group that's being converted into a diazonium salt.

Then step 2 is H2O. Diazonium salts in water with heat would typically undergo hydrolysis, perhaps to form a phenol if it's a benzene ring.

Step 3 is aqueous KOH and heat. That might be a hydrolysis of some kind, maybe elimination if there's a good leaving group, but I'm not sure yet.

Wait, let's look at the NMR again. The triplet at 9.72 ppm. Could that be a conjugated aldehyde, maybe part of an enal structure? Because in enals, the aldehyde proton is sometimes split due to coupling with the adjacent double bond. So maybe it's an aldehyde next to a double bond. So, for example, in a compound like crotonaldehyde, the aldehyde proton might be a triplet because of coupling with the adjacent double bond protons.

Looking at the other signals: the 6.98 and 6.51 ppm are doublets, each integrating to 2H. Those might be para-substituted benzene rings. Because in para substitution, the two protons are equivalent and show as a doublet. For example, in a para-substituted phenyl group, the protons would be a doublet because they're each next to one substituent. Wait, no, wait. In para substitution, the adjacent protons are actually on adjacent carbons, but if the substituent is in the para position, the neighboring protons are meta to each other. Hmm, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Let me think again.

Alternatively, maybe the 6.98 and 6.51 are part of a conjugated system, like a di-substituted benzene. Wait, if there are two doublets, each
