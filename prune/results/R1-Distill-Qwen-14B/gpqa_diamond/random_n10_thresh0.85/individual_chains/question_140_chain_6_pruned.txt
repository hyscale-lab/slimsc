Okay, let's tackle this chemistry problem step by step. Hmm, the question's a bit involved, but I'll try to break it down.

So, the question involves a reaction where Substance X reacts with liquid Y. They mention that X incorporates a heavier isotope of one of its elements. The reaction releases gas W, which has a molecule where the number of neutrons equals the number of protons. Then, a precipitate G forms, which upon heating releases B. The melting point of B is around 277 K, which is about 4 degrees Celsius. Wait, I remember that 0 degrees Celsius is 273 K, so 277 K is just a bit above that. Hmm, what has a melting point around there?

Also, the product of a reaction between a certain keto acid and Substance X has two oxygen atoms. And X is used as a reagent in organic chemistry, with an analog that's very close. Oh, wait, maybe X is something like a strong base or a reducing agent?

Let me think about the first reaction. Substance X reacting violently with a liquid Y to produce gas W. What liquids react violently with certain substances? Oh, maybe it's a reaction with water? Like, a metal reacting with water. For instance, sodium reacts violently with water to produce hydrogen gas. Or maybe another metal.

But wait, Substance X has a heavier isotope. So X is probably a diatomic molecule or a simple compound. Let's think about the gas W. Its molecule has equal number of neutrons and protons. Let's see, if W is H2O, but no, that doesn't fit. Wait, W's molecule has same neutrons and protons. So each molecule has same number of neutrons and protons.

Wait, perhaps W is NH3? No, each molecule has 14 neutrons and 14 protons? Wait, no. Let me think in terms of isotopes. Maybe W is something like O2? Each O atom has 8 protons. If it's O-16, which is the most common, 8 protons, 8 neutrons. So each O2 molecule has 16 protons and 16 neutrons. So the number of neutrons equals the number of protons in the molecule. That fits. But O2 is a gas and is produced in some reactions.

Alternatively, maybe W is something else. Let's think of other gases. For example, CO2: each CO2 molecule has 12 (for C) + 16*2 (O) = 12+32=44. So protons: C has 6, each O has 8. So in CO2, protons: 6 + 8*2 = 22. Neutrons: C has 6 (if it's C-12), O has 8 each. So each O has 8 neutrons. So CO2 would have (6 + 8*2) neutrons? Wait, each O is O-16, so 8 neutrons each. So total neutrons in CO2 would be 6 (from C) + 8*2 = 22. So protons: 6 + 8*2 = 22. So same. So CO2 also has equal protons and neutrons per molecule. Hmm, that could be a possibility.

Wait, but from the reaction: X reacting with Y (liquid) gives W as gas and precipitate G. What reactions produce CO2? Maybe a carbonate reacting with an acid? Or maybe a reaction where a metal carbonate is treated with an acid, producing CO2. But then, X would be the acid? Or maybe something else.

Alternatively, maybe X is a metal, Y is an acid, and W is H2. If X is a metal, like sodium, reacting with an acid (liquid Y) would produce H2 gas. But H2's molecule has 2 H atoms, each with 1 proton and 0 neutrons (if H is H-1). So each H2 molecule has 2 protons and 0 neutrons. Not equal. So that doesn't fit. So not H2.

Wait, another thought: if W has same number of neutrons and protons. So per molecule, protons = neutrons. So for example, H2O: each molecule would have (2*1 + 8) protons and (2*0 + 8) neutrons. Wait, no, that's not equal. Wait, no, maybe W is something else.

Wait, let's think about the possible products. If X is a metal and Y is water, maybe the reaction produces H2 gas. But that doesn't fit. Or perhaps X is a carbonate reacting with an acid, producing CO2. Let's think: if X is sodium carbonate (Na2CO3) reacting with an acid (like HCl), the reaction would produce CO2 gas. So the W would be CO2. That fits because in CO2, protons = 22 (6+8*2=22) and neutrons = 22 (6 in C and 8 each in O's). So each CO2 molecule has 22 protons and 22 neutrons. That fits the condition.

So if W is CO2, then Y could be an acid, perhaps HCl, and X is a carbonate. But then, what's the precipitate G? If X is a carbonate, and Y is an acid, the reaction would produce CO2 and a salt. But if the acid is HCl and the carbonate is Na2CO3, the product would be NaCl, which is soluble, so maybe that's not the case. Alternatively, perhaps Y is an aqueous solution of a metal hydroxide, but I'm getting a bit confused.

Wait, another angle: the product of a reaction between a certain keto acid and X contains 2 oxygen atoms. So, when a keto acid (like a carboxylic acid, which has a keto group and a COOH group) reacts with X, the product has two O atoms. Hmm, maybe X is something like a base that deprotonates the acid, but I'm not sure how that would lead to a product with two O's. Alternatively, perhaps X is an oxidizing agent.

Wait, another approach: B's melting point is near 277 K, which is about 4Â°C. What substance has a melting point around there? Hmm, water freezes at 273 K, so 277 is just a bit above. Wait, maybe it's ice? No, that's lower. Or perhaps another substance. Wait, maybe B is a type of salt or a different compound. Alternatively, perhaps B is a solid that forms when G is heated. Let's think about G. The precipitate G, when heated, releases B. So G is something that decomposes upon heating to give B.

Wait, maybe G is a carbonate, and when heated, it decomposes into a metal oxide and CO2. Or perhaps G is something else. Let me think again. If X is reacting with Y to produce CO2, then perhaps X is a carbonate. Let's say X is Na2CO3. When it reacts with HCl (Y), it produces CO2, NaCl, and water. But the precipitate G might not form unless Y is a solution that causes a precipitation. Alternatively, perhaps Y is a solution of a different salt. Hmm, this is getting a bit tangled.

Alternatively, let's think about the other part. The product of a keto acid and X has two O atoms. Keto acids have a carbonyl group. For example, acetic acid is a keto acid. If X reacts with acetic acid to produce something with two O's. Wait, maybe X is a strong base like NaOH. NaOH reacting with acetic acid would produce sodium acetate and water. Sodium acetate has the formula CH3COONa. The product would have multiple O atoms, but the question specifies that the product has two O atoms. Hmm, not sure.

Wait, perhaps X is something else. Let's think about the initial reaction again. X, a heavier isotope, reacts with Y (liquid) to produce W (gas with equal protons and neutrons per molecule), precipitate G, which upon heating gives B with melting point near 277 K.

Wait, what if Y is water and X is a metal? For example, sodium reacting
