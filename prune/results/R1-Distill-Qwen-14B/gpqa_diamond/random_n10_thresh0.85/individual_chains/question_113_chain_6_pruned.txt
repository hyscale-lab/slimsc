Okay, I'm trying to solve this chemistry problem. Let me read it carefully and think through each step.

So, the question is about identifying an unknown compound using its IR, NMR, and Mass Spectrometry data. The options are four different chemical formulas: C6H12O2, C6H10O, C6H10O2, and C6H12O.

First, I'll break down each piece of data provided.

Starting with the FTIR spectrum. It shows a very broad absorption around 3000 cm-1. Broad peaks around there usually indicate O-H stretching. If it's very broad, maybe it's an alcohol or a carboxylic acid. Also, there are strong peaks at 1700 and 1650 cm-1. The 1700 is probably a carbonyl group (C=O). The 1650 might be another carbonyl or possibly an aromatic ring with conjugation or maybe a conjugated carbonyl. Wait, C=O in a ketone is around 1700, but if it's conjugated, like in an ester or something, it might be lower. Alternatively, 1650 could be an aromatic C=C stretch or maybe an amide, but I don't see any info about amines here.

Next, the 1H NMR shows peaks corresponding to vinyl hydrogens. Vinyl hydrogens are the ones attached to a double bond, like in alkenes. So the compound probably has an alkene group.

The mass spectrum has a fragment at m/z 45. Hmm. Let me think about what fragments could give m/z 45. Possible fragments include CH3COOH (but that's 60?), wait, wait. Let me think. The molecular ion might be broken down into smaller ions. 45 could be C3H7O or something similar. Wait, 45 is the molecular weight of (CH3)2O (dimethyl ether is 45?), no, wait. Dimethyl ether is (CH3)2O, which is 45? Let's calculate: C=12, H=1, O=16. So 12*2 + 1*6 +16=24+6+16=46? Oh wait, no. Wait, (CH3)2O is (CH3)2O: 2*(12+3*1) + 16 = 2*15 +16=30+16=46. So that can't be. So 45 must be another fragment.

Wait, the molecular formula options are C6H12O2, C6H10O, C6H10O2, C6H12O. Let me think about possible structures.

Looking at the IR again: the broad peak at 3000 cm-1 is likely an O-H group. So the compound has an O-H. The strong peak at 1700 could be an ester (since esters have two carbonyl groups: one around 1740 and another around 1700? Or maybe a ketone. Wait, no, esters have one carbonyl at around 1740, but if it's conjugated, maybe lower. Alternatively, maybe it's a carbonyl from a ketone and another from an ester or an acid.

Wait, but wait, the FTIR has two strong peaks at 1700 and 1650. So two carbonyl groups? Or one in a different environment. For example, an ester has one carbonyl around 1740, but if the compound is an acid anhydride or something else, maybe two. Alternatively, maybe one is a conjugated carbonyl, like in an aromatic ring. Wait, 1650 could be a conjugated C=O, maybe in an aromatic ester or something. Or perhaps a C=C in an aromatic ring.

So, looking at the options, the formulas are:

A) C6H12O2: That's like esters, possibly. Or maybe a diol with another group.

B) C6H10O: Maybe an alcohol with a double bond, like cyclohexene with a hydroxyl group.

C) C6H10O2: Could be an ester, or a ketone with an alcohol, but that's less likely. Maybe a cyclic ester? Or a diester?

D) C6H12O: That's like a diol, maybe. Or a mono alcohol with a double bond.

Wait, the NMR shows vinyl hydrogens, meaning there's a double bond. So the compound must have an alkene.

So, considering each option:

Option A: C6H12O2. Degrees of unsaturation: (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. Assuming no X or N. So (2*6 +2 -12 -0)/2 = (14 -12)/2=1. So one degree of unsaturation, which could be a ring or a double bond. But according to the NMR, there's a double bond, so that's one. So either a ring or another double bond. Wait, wait, let me recalculate. For C6H12O2:

Degrees of unsaturation: (2*6 +2 -12 -0 +0)/2 = (14-12)/2 = 1. So only one double bond or ring. But the IR suggests possibly two carbonyl groups? Or another group. Hmm.

Wait, but if O2 is present, maybe it's an ester group. An ester has a carbonyl. So maybe another group.

Wait, the IR has two strong peaks at 1700 and 1650 cm-1. So two
