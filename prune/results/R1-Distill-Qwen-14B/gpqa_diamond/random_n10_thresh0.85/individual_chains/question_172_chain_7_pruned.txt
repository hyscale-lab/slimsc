Okay, so I've got this question about stars and their photospheres. Hmm, let me think. The question says that iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited as those in star_2. Oh right, so maybe it's about the excitation levels and how they relate to temperature?

Wait, the problem states that the photospheres are in LTE, which is Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium. That means the usual laws of thermodynamics apply there, right? So I should probably use the Boltzmann distribution for this.

Boltzmann distribution says that the population of energy levels is proportional to exp(-E/(kT)), where E is the energy, k is Boltzmann's constant, and T is the temperature. Oh right, the ratio of the populations between two energy levels is given by that exponential.

So in this case, the excitation level is the same for both stars, but the populations (number of atoms in that level) are different. Let me denote the energy levels as E for both, since it's the same transition. Wait, the problem says the energy difference between the considered energy levels is 1.38e-23 J, but maybe that's a red herring because the ratio only depends on the temperatures.

Wait, the question is about the effective temperatures of the stars. So star_1 has twice as many excited iron atoms as star_2. So the ratio of their populations would be N1/N2 = 2.

So according to the Boltzmann equation, N1/N2 = exp( -(E1)/(k T1) ) / exp( -(E2)/(k T2) ). Wait, but E1 and E2 here are the same since it's the same energy level being considered, right? Because they're comparing the same transition in both stars. So E1 = E2 = E. Oh wait, no. The energy difference is given as Î”E = E_upper - E_lower. So perhaps I should consider the ratio of the excited state to the lower state.

Wait wait, the way the question is phrased is a bit ambiguous. It says iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to star_2. So does that mean the population in the higher energy level is twice as much in star_1 as in star_2? Or maybe the excitation is higher, meaning more in the excited state. Let me assume that N_upper1 / N_lower1 is twice N_upper2 / N_lower2. Or perhaps the ratio of upper to lower is higher for star_1.

Wait, no. Let me clarify. The ratio of the number of excited atoms (in a specific energy level) in star_1 to that in star_2 is 2:1. So N1/N2 = 2. But how is this ratio determined by the Boltzmann factor?

Wait, each star's photosphere is in LTE, so for each star, the ratio of the population in an excited state to the ground state (or another lower state) is given by the Boltzmann factor. So the ratio for each star is (N_upper)/(N_lower) = exp( -
