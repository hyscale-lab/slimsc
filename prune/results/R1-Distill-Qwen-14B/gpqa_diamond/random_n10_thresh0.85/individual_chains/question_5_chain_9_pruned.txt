Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem about finding the eigenvector of a muon's operator along an arbitrary direction in the x-z plane. Hmm, let's break it down.

First, the problem mentions the operator P, which has components P_x, P_y, and P_z. Each of these is a 2x2 matrix multiplied by ħ/2. My task is to find the eigenvector corresponding to the eigenvalue +ħ/2 for the operator vector P along direction n in the x-z plane.

Wait, the operator P is a vector operator. So, the operator along an arbitrary direction n is P · n, right? So, if n is in the x-z plane, it can be expressed as (sinθ, 0, cosθ) or something like that. Oh wait, usually direction vectors in spherical coordinates have φ as the angle in the xy-plane and θ as the polar angle from the z-axis. So, yeah, for x-z plane, φ is zero, right? Or wait, maybe the direction is a combination of x and z. So, n = (nx, 0, nz), since it's in x-z plane.

So, the operator P along n would be P_n = n_x P_x + n_z P_z. Because P_y component would be zero since the direction is in x-z, no component in y.

The given components are:
P_x = ħ/2 * [[0, 1], [1, 0]]
P_y = ħ/2 * [[0, -i], [i, 0]]
P_z = ħ/2 * [[1, 0], [0, -1]]

So, putting that in, P_n = (n_x) * [[0,1],[1,0]] * (ħ/2) + (n_z) * [[1,0],[0,-1]] * (ħ/2)

Since n is a unit vector, nx² + nz² = 1. Wait, actually, n is a vector in x-z plane, so n_x and n_z are its components, and n_y is zero. So, n = (n_x, 0, n_z), and |n| = 1 => n_x² + n_z² = 1.

So, the matrix for P_n would be:

(ħ/2) * [ [n_z, n_x], [n_x, -n_z] ]

Wait, let's compute it:

n_x * P_x = n_x * (ħ/2) * [[0,1],[1,0]]
n_z * P_z = n_z * (ħ/2) * [[1, 0],[0, -1]]
Adding these together:

First component (1,1): 0 + n_z*(1) → n_z * (ħ/2)
(1,2): n_x * (1) → n_x * (ħ/2)
(2,1): same as (1,2), because it's a matrix, so n_x * (ħ/2)
(2,2): 0 + (-n_z) → -n_z * (ħ/2)

So, the matrix is:

[ [n_z, n_x], [n_x, -n_z] ] multiplied by ħ/2.

So, the matrix P_n is:

(ħ/2) * [ [n_z, n_x],
           [n_x, -n_z] ]

We need to find its eigenvector with eigenvalue +ħ/2.

So, the eigenvalue equation is: P_n |ψ> = (+ħ/2) |ψ>

Subtracting the eigenvalue from both sides: (P_n - (ħ/2) I) |ψ> = 0.

So, the matrix becomes:

(ħ/2) [ [n_z -1, n_x ],
         [n_x, -n_z -1 ] ]

Wait, let me compute it properly. So, I'm writing the matrix P_n - (ħ/2) I:

Each element is:

[ [n_z*(ħ/2) - (ħ/2)*1, n_x*(ħ/2) ],
  [n_x*(ħ/2), (-n_z)*(ħ/2) - (ħ/2)*1 ] ]

Factor ħ/2 out:

(ħ/2) * [ [n_z -1, n_x ],
           [n_x, -n_z -1 ] ]

So, the matrix is:

[ [n_z -1, n_x],
  [n_x, -n_z -1 ] ] multiplied by ħ/2.

But since we're looking for non-trivial solutions, the determinant of this matrix must be zero.

The determinant is:

(n_z -1)(-n_z -1) - (n_x)^2 = 0

Let's compute that:

(n_z -1)(-n_z -1) = (-n_z^2 -n_z + n_z +1) = (-n_z^2 + 1)
So, determinant equation: (-n_z^2 +1) - n_x^2 = 0 → 1 - (n_z^2 + n_x^2) = 0 → but n_x² + n_z² = 1 (since n is a unit vector). So, 1 - 1 =0 → 0=0. So, the equation is automatically satisfied, which means that any non-trivial solution exists, so we can find eigenvectors.

So, the eigenvector equations are:

[ (n_z -1) ψ₁ + n_x ψ₂ = 0
  n_x ψ₁ + (-n_z -1) ψ₂ = 0 ]

Let me take the first equation:

(n_z -1) ψ₁ + n_x ψ₂ = 0 → ψ₂ = [ (1 - n_z)/n_x ] ψ₁

Wait, but ψ₁ and ψ₂ are the components of the eigenvector. So, let's express ψ₂ in terms of ψ₁.

So, ψ₂ = [ (1 - n_z) / n_x ] ψ₁

But we have to ensure that ψ₁ and ψ₂ are non-zero. Also, the direction vector n can be written as (sinθ, 0, cosθ), perhaps, since it's in the x-z plane, so θ would be the angle from the z-axis.

Alternatively, n_x = cosθ, n_z = sinθ? Wait, wait, no, in standard spherical coordinates, I think n_z is cosθ. Wait, let me think: in the x-z plane, θ is the angle from the z-axis, so n_z would be cosθ, and n_x would be sinθ. Because imagine θ=0, then pointing along z, n_x=0, n_z=1. θ=90 degrees, pointing along x, n_z=0, n_x=1.

So, n_x = sinθ, n_z = cosθ, since direction is (sinθ, 0, cosθ).

So, substituting, n_z = cosθ, n_x = sinθ.

So, ψ₂ = [ (1 - cosθ) / sinθ ] ψ₁.

We can write the eigenvector as ψ = [ ψ₁, ψ₂ ]^T = ψ₁ [1, (1 - cosθ)/sinθ ]^T

But for θ not equal to 0 or 180 degrees, sinθ isn't zero.

Wait, but let's think about θ=0: that would mean n is along z. Then, n_x=0, so the expression for ψ₂ would be undefined. We need to handle that case separately, but perhaps the current approach is okay.

So, the eigenvector is along the direction [1, (1 - cosθ)/sinθ ].

But (1 - cosθ)/sin
