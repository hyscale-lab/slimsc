Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics question here. Let's see what it's about. Hmm, the question involves two quantum states with energies E1 and E2. Their lifetimes are given as 10^-9 seconds and 10^-8 seconds. I need to find their energy difference so that they can be clearly resolved. The options are A to D.

Wait, I'm a bit fuzzy on this. I remember that the energy-time uncertainty principle comes into play here. Oh right, the Heisenberg uncertainty principle. It states that the product of the uncertainty in energy (ΔE) and the uncertainty in time (Δt) is at least ħ/2, where ħ is the reduced Planck's constant.

So, the formula is ΔE * Δt ≈ ħ/2. Or maybe it's just an inequality, like ΔE Δt ≥ ħ/(2π) or something like that. I'm not entirely sure about the exact coefficient, but for this problem, maybe it's sufficient to know that a smaller uncertainty in time leads to a larger uncertainty in energy, and vice versa.

Wait, the question is about distinguishing two energy levels. So, the energy difference between E1 and E2 must be larger than the uncertainty in energy for each state. Because if the energy difference is smaller than the uncertainty, you can't distinguish them—they'd appear as a single energy level.

So each state has its own lifetime, which I think corresponds to the uncertainty in time, Δt. So for each state, their ΔE would be ħ/(Δt), or something like that. But wait, the question is about the energy difference between E2 and E1. So, the energy difference should be greater than the uncertainties of both states? Or perhaps just the maximum of the two? Or maybe the sum?

Wait, no. Let me think again. The uncertainty principle applies to each state individually. So for each state, the uncertainty in energy is inversely proportional to its lifetime. The longer the lifetime (the more precisely the energy is known), the smaller the uncertainty.

So for the first state with lifetime τ1 = 1e-9 sec, the uncertainty ΔE1 is roughly ħ/(τ1). Similarly, for τ2 = 1e-8 sec, ΔE2 is ħ/(τ2). Wait, but since τ2 is longer, ΔE2 is smaller than ΔE1.

Wait, the energy difference between E2 and E1 must be larger than both ΔE1 and ΔE2, right? Because if the energy separation is larger than the uncertainty in each, you can distinguish them. Because if the separation is smaller than one of the uncertainties, then you can't tell them apart.

Alternatively, perhaps the energy difference just needs to be larger than the maximum of the two uncertainties. So, for instance, if the energy difference is bigger than the larger uncertainty, then it should be resolvable.

Hmm, let's compute the uncertainties. Let's take ħ as approximately 6.626e-34 J·s divided by 2π, but wait, sometimes the uncertainty principle is written with ħ/2 instead of ħ. Let me check. Oh, right, the uncertainty principle is often written as ΔE Δt ≥ ħ/2, but sometimes it's ΔE Δt ≥ 1/(2π) when using natural units. Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think again.

Alternatively, perhaps I should think of the natural linewidth or the energy width of each state. The uncertainty in energy is inversely proportional to the lifetime. So, for a state with a shorter lifetime (Δt), the energy uncertainty is larger
