Okay, so I've got this physics problem in front of me, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of quantum models and molecular states. But I'll try to think it through step by step. Let's see what the question says.

Alright, the problem is about a diatomic molecule made of atoms X and Y. They can be modeled using the quantum rotation-vibration model, which I remember is the non-rigid rotor model. The molecule is in its fundamental state, and we need to find the momentum an absorbed photon should have to switch it to the next lowest energy state. The options are given as A to D.

First, I need to recall what the fundamental state means. Oh wait, the fundamental state in molecular vibrations is the lowest energy state, which is the first vibrational level (v=0). But wait, the question is about moving to the next state with the lowest possible energy. Hmm, so maybe it's considering both rotational and vibrational transitions? Or could it be just one of them?

Wait, the model is the rotation-vibration model, which combines both rotational and vibrational energies. So the molecule's energy levels are a combination of both rotational and vibrational states. The fundamental state would be the lowest vibrational state (v=0) and the lowest rotational state (J=0). But when it absorbs a photon, it can either change vibrational or rotational state, or maybe both.

Wait, the question says the molecule is in its fundamental state, and we want to switch to the next state with the lowest possible energy. Oh, that's a bit ambiguous. The next state with the lowest energy might mean the next higher state in either vibration or rotation, whichever is lower in energy.

Wait, but for diatomic molecules, the rotational energy levels are quantized as E_rot = B J (J +1), where B is the rotational constant. And the vibrational energy levels are quantized as E_vib = (v + 1/2) h w, where w is the angular frequency. So the fundamental state is v=0 and J=0. The next state could be either v=0, J=1 (first rotational state) or v=1, J=0 (first vibrational state). Which of these has lower energy?

Let me compute the energy of both possibilities. The energy of J=1 for rotational would be E_rot = B * (1)(2) = 2B. The vibrational energy for v=1 would be E_vib = (1 + 1/2) h w = (3/2) h w.

So we need to compare
