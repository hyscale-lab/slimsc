Okay, so I've got this question about exoplanets and their transit probabilities. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

So, the researchers want to observe the planet with the highest probability of transiting. Both planets are Earth-like and have been detected via the radial velocity (RV) method. That means we know their minimum masses and orbital periods. Both have the same mass, so that's the same factor for both.

Wait, their orbital periods are different. Planet_1 has a shorter period, three times shorter than Planet_2. Oh, right, orbital period relates to the size of the orbit. Shorter period means it's closer to its star. Because orbital period is related to the semi-major axis via Kepler's third law. The formula is P² = (4π²/G(M+m)) * a³. Since M is the star's mass and m is the planet's mass, and the planets have the same mass, but the stars have different masses. Wait, the host star of Planet_1 has twice the mass of Planet_2's star. So that affects the semi-major axis.

But wait, for the transit probability, I think it depends on the alignment of the orbital plane relative to our line of sight. The probability is higher if the planet's orbit is edge-on. But the question is about the probability that a transit occurs at all, regardless of when it happens. The transit probability (geometric probability) depends on the size of the planet's orbit relative to the star's size.

The formula for the transit probability is R_star / a, where R_star is the radius of the star and a is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit. Wait, no, I think it's the ratio (R_planet + R_star) / a, but for Earth-like planets, the planet is much smaller than the star, so R_planet << R_star. So it's approximately R_star / a.

Wait, no, wait. The transit probability is the chance that the planet's orbital plane is aligned such that it passes in front of the star from our point of view. So the probability is given by (R_star + R_p) / a, but since R_p << R_star, it's approximately R_star / a.

Wait, or is it actually (R_star + R_p) / a, but since R_p is much smaller, it's roughly R_star / a. Oh, but sometimes it's approximated as (R_star / a
