Okay, so I've got this question about symmetries in the Standard Model Effective Field Theory, or SMEFT. Hmm, I remember that SMEFT is an effective theory that includes all possible higher-dimensional operators consistent with the Standard Model symmetries. But wait, what exactly are the symmetries that operators in SMEFT must respect?

The question lists four symmetries: 1. Lorentz Symmetry, 2. Poincare Symmetry, 3. CP symmetry, 4. CPT symmetry. And the options are combinations of these. So I need to figure out which of these must be respected by all operators in SMEFT.

Wait, first, I should clarify what each symmetry implies. Let's start with Lorentz symmetry. Lorentz symmetry is the symmetry of spacetime under Lorentz transformations, which include rotations and boosts. In the Standard Model, all interactions respect Lorentz symmetry, so SMEFT, being an effective theory, should also respect it. So operators in SMEFT must be Lorentz-invariant. So that means symmetry 1 is definitely required. So any operator in SMEFT must respect Lorentz symmetry.

Next, Poincare symmetry. Poincare symmetry includes Lorentz symmetry plus translations. So it's the full symmetry of Minkowski spacetime. But wait, SMEFT is a low-energy effective theory. When you include higher-dimensional operators, like in the form of cO_L / Lambda^k, do these operators necessarily respect Poincare symmetry? Or is it only Lorentz symmetry? Hmm, because Poincare includes momentum translations, which relate to momentum conservation. But in an effective theory, operators can have different scaling with energy, so maybe the Poincare symmetry isn't necessarily enforced beyond the fact that the theory as a whole is Lorentz-invariant. Wait, but SMEFT is built upon the SM, which already respects Poincare symmetry. So maybe all operators in SMEFT are Poincare-invariant because they are built from SM fields which transform properly. But wait, Poincare symmetry includes the possibility of terms that change the particle number or something? Or is it automatically maintained because the SM does so?

Alternatively, perhaps operators in SMEFT are required to be Poincare-invariant. But wait, Lorentz symmetry is a subset of Poincare. So if the operators respect Lorentz symmetry, does that automatically imply anything about Poincare? Not necessarily. Because Poincare includes momentum translations, which could affect the form of the operators. Wait, but in the effective theory, when you write down operators, you're considering terms that are allowed
