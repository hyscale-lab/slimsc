Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a relativistic harmonic oscillator. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think through it.

The problem says it's a one-dimensional oscillator with mass m and maximum amplitude A. It obeys Hooke's law, F = -kx. We're supposed to find the maximum speed v_max. Oh wait, and it's relativistic, so I guess we have to consider relativistic effects.

I remember that in classical mechanics, the maximum speed of a harmonic oscillator can be found using energy conservation. The potential energy at maximum displacement (amplitude A) is (1/2)kA². The kinetic energy at the equilibrium position would be the same, so (1/2)mv_max² = (1/2)kA². Solving that gives v_max = sqrt(kA²/m) = A*sqrt(k/m). So that's the non-relativistic case.

But since this is a relativistic scenario, we can't use classical mechanics anymore. So I need to think about relativistic energy. In special relativity, the total energy E is given by gamma times mc², where gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²). Hmm, but wait, the oscillator in relativity—how does the energy equation look?

The potential energy in a relativistic harmonic oscillator might be different. Wait, but the problem says it's obeying Hooke's law, so I'm assuming F = -kx, which is the same as the classical case. But when you're dealing with relativity, the equations of motion change because of the gamma factor.

So, let's think about energy. The total energy of the oscillator would be the sum of kinetic and potential energy, but both would be relativistic.

Wait, wait. Oh, in a harmonic oscillator, at maximum displacement (x=A), all the energy is potential. At the equilibrium point (x=0), all the energy is kinetic. So perhaps I can set the total energy equal to the potential energy at maximum displacement and the kinetic energy at equilibrium.

In the non-relativistic case, energy conservation gives (1/2)kA² = (1/2)mv². But relativistically, the kinetic energy isn't (gamma -1)mc²? Or wait, the total energy is gamma mc². So, at maximum displacement, the potential energy is (1/2)kA², and the kinetic energy is zero. So the total energy E = (1/2)kA².

At the equilibrium point (x=0), the potential energy is zero, and the kinetic energy is maximum. So the total energy is all kinetic, which is gamma mc². So setting them equal: (1/2)kA² = gamma mc².

Wait, but gamma here is for the velocity at that point, which is v_max. So gamma = 1/sqrt(1 - v_max²/c²). Therefore, (1/2)kA² = (gamma) mc².

Wait, but that gives (1/2)kA² = [1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²)] * mc². Let me solve for v.

So, rearranging: (1/2)kA² = (mc²) / sqrt(1 - v²/c²).

Multiply both sides by sqrt(1 - v²/c²):

(1/2)kA² * sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = mc².

Hmm, this looks a bit complicated. Maybe square both sides to eliminate the square root.

Wait, let me write it as:

(1/2 k A²) = (mc²) * [1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²)].

Which can be written as:

(1/2 k A²) = mc² * gamma.

So solving for gamma: gamma = (1/2 k A²) / (mc²).

But gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²), so:

1/sqrt(1 - (v/c)^2) = (k A²)/(2 m c²).

Take reciprocal of both sides:

sqrt(1 - (v/c)^2) = (2 m c²) / (k A²).

Wait, but let me check that: if I have 1/x = y, then x = 1/y. So yes, that's correct.

So, sqrt(1 - (v²/c²)) = (2 m c²)/(k A^2).

Now, square both sides:

1 - v²/c² = (4 m² c^4)/(k² A^4).

Rearranging for v²/c²:

v²/c² = 1 - (4 m² c^4)/(k² A^4) )

Hmm, but wait, that seems a bit odd. Let me think again.

Wait, maybe I should approach it differently. Let's square both sides
