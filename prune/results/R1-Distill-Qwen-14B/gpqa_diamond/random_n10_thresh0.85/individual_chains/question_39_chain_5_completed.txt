Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Hmm, let me try to figure it out step by step. Alright, the question is about finding the value of 'a' in the wave function. 

The wave function given is (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i. Wait, but wait a second. I remember that wave functions must be square-integrable, meaning their square modulus must be finite when integrated over all space. Oh, right, and the integral of the probability density should equal 1 because the total probability of finding the particle somewhere must be 100%.

But wait, the problem says that when they measured the particles, none were found outside x=1 and x=3. So the wave function must be zero outside that region. Oh, but wait, the wave function given is (a/sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i. So for the regions x <1 and x>3, the wave function should be zero. 

Wait, no. Because the wave function given is the one where the particle exists. Oh, the problem states that particles were only found between x=1 and x=3. So the wave function is zero outside that region. But the given expression is for the part where the particle can exist, which is between 1 and 3. So that means the wave function is (a/sqrt(1+x)) -0.5i for x between 1 and 3, and zero elsewhere. 

But wait, that's not possible because when x is less than 1, say x approaches negative infinity, the denominator would be a problem. But the particles are only found between 1 and 3. So I think the given wave function is only valid in that region. So we can proceed under that assumption.

Now, the wave function must be normalized. The integral of the square of the absolute value of the wave function from x=1 to x=3 must equal 1. 

The wave function is ψ(x) = (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i. Let's compute the absolute square, |ψ(x)|². 

The absolute square is the product of ψ and its complex conjugate. The complex conjugate of ψ is (a / sqrt(1+x)) + 0.5i. So when we multiply them:

ψ * ψ* = [a/sqrt(1+x)]² + (0.5i)(-0.5i) + (other cross terms). Wait, no, let's compute it correctly.

Wait, (a/sqrt(1+x) - 0.5i)(a/sqrt(1+x) + 0.5i) = (a/sqrt(1+x))² - (0.5i)^2. Because (x - y)(x + y) = x² - y².

Right, so that's [a²/(1+x)] - ( (0.5)^2 (i)^2 ). Since i squared is -1, the second term becomes - (0.25 * (-1)) ) = + 0.25. So |ψ|² = a²/(1+x) + 0.25.

So the integral from x=1 to x=3 of |ψ|² dx should be 1. 

So we set up the integral:

∫ (from 1 to 3) [ a²/(1+x) + 0.25 ] dx = 1.

Let's split this integral into two parts:

Integral of a²/(1+x) dx from 1 to 3, plus integral of 0.25 dx from 1 to 3, equals 1.

Compute each part:

First integral: a² * ∫1/(1+x) dx from 1 to3. The integral of 1/(1+x) is ln(1+x). Evaluated from 1 to3: ln(4) - ln(2) = ln(4/2) = ln(2).

So first part is a² * ln(2).

Second integral: 0.25*(3-1) = 0.25*2=0.5.

So putting it together: a² * ln(2) + 0.5 = 1.

Thus, a² ln(2) = 0.5.

Solving for a²: a² = 0.5 / ln(2).

What's ln(2)? Approximately 0.6931.

So 0.5 / 0.6931 ≈ 0.7213. So a squared is about 0.7213. Taking square root, a ≈ sqrt(0.7213) ≈ 0.849. Let's see, the options given are A)1.1, B)0.85, C)0.35, D)0.6.

So 0.849 is approximately 0.85, which is option B.


To determine the value of "a" in the wave function, we start by normalizing the wave function. The wave function is given as:

\[
\psi(x) = \frac{a}{\sqrt{1+x}} - 0.5i
\]

The absolute square of the wave function is:

\[
|\psi(x)|^2 = \left(\frac{a}{\sqrt{1+x}}\right)^2 + (0.5)^2 = \frac{a^2}{1+x} + 0.25
\]

Since the wave function is zero outside the region \(x = 1\) to \(x = 3\), the normalization condition requires:

\[
\int_{1}^{3} |\psi(x)|^2 dx = 1
\]

Substituting \(|\psi(x)|^2\), the integral becomes:

\[
\int_{1}^{3} \left(\frac{a^2}{1+x} + 0.25\right) dx = 1
\]

This can be split into two parts:

\[
a^2 \int_{1}^{3} \frac{1}{1+x} dx + 0.25 \int_{1}^{3} dx = 1
\]

1. **First integral**:  
   \[
   \int_{1}^{3} \frac{1}{1+x} dx = \ln(1+x) \Big|_{1}^{3} = \ln(4) - \ln(2) = \ln(2)
   \]
   So, the first term becomes:
   \[
   a^2 \ln(2)
   \]

2. **Second integral**:  
   \[
   0.25 \int_{1}^{3} dx = 0.25 \cdot (3-1) = 0.5
   \]

Combining these results:

\[
a^2 \ln(2) + 0.5 = 1
\]

Solving for \(a^2\):

\[
a^2 \ln(2) = 0.5 \quad \Rightarrow \quad a^2 = \frac{0.5}{\ln(2)}
\]

Using \(\ln(2) \approx 0.6931\):

\[
a^2 \approx \frac{0.5}{0.6931} \approx 0.7213
\]

Taking the square root:

\[
a \approx \sqrt{0.7213} \approx 0.849
\]

Comparing this value to the options, the closest match is \(a = 0.85\), which corresponds to **Option B**.

Answer: B
