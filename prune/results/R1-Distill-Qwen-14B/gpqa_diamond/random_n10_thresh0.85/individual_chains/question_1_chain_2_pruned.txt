Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics question here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question is about.

The question says that there are two quantum states with energies E1 and E2. Their lifetimes are 10^-9 seconds and 10^-8 seconds, respectively. We need to find the energy difference between them so that they can be clearly distinguished. The options are A to D, with various values.

Hmm, I remember something about lifetimes and energy differences relating to the uncertainty principle. Oh right, the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle. That's the one where the product of the uncertainty in energy and the uncertainty in time is at least h-bar over 2, or something like that. So the formula is ΔE * Δt ≥ ħ/2. Or wait, sometimes it's written as ΔEΔt ≈ ħ/2, or maybe just ħ for an approximate calculation.

So the idea is that if the energy levels have a certain lifetime (which I think is the time uncertainty, Δt), then the uncertainty in energy (ΔE) is inversely proportional to that lifetime. So a shorter lifetime means a larger uncertainty in energy, making it harder to distinguish between states because their energies might overlap in the uncertainty.

Wait, but in this problem, we have two different lifetimes. Oh wait no, each state has its own lifetime. So, each state's energy uncertainty is determined by its own lifetime. But how does that relate to the energy difference between the two states?

Wait, maybe I got that wrong. The energy difference is what determines whether the two states can be resolved. So if the energy difference is larger than the sum of their uncertainties, then they can be distinguished. Because if the energy difference is smaller than the uncertainties, the lines would overlap, and you can't tell them apart.

So the key is that the energy difference (ΔE) between the two states must be greater than the uncertainty in energy of each state. Wait, but each has a different lifetime, so each has a different uncertainty.

Wait, perhaps for a state with a lifetime τ, the uncertainty in energy ΔE is approximately ħ / τ. So for E1, lifetime τ1 is 1e-9 seconds. Similarly, E2 has τ2=1e-8 seconds.

So the uncertainty for E1 would be ΔE1 ≈ ħ/(τ1), and for E2, ΔE2 ≈ ħ/(τ2). But since τ2 is larger than τ1, ΔE2 is smaller than ΔE1.

But when considering the energy difference between E2 and E1, which is E2 - E1 = ΔE, we need this ΔE to be larger than some value to be resolvable. Maybe the sum of the uncertainties? Or perhaps each uncertainty.

Wait, no, because each state's energy has an uncertainty. So the minimum ΔE required for them to be distinguishable would have to be at least on the order of the larger of the two uncertainties, perhaps? Or maybe the sum. Hmm, not entirely sure.

Wait, let's think in terms of the uncertainty principle. The uncertainty in the energy of each state is proportional to 1/τ. So for E1, ΔE1 = ħ / τ1. For E2, ΔE2 = ħ / τ2. Since τ2 is larger, ΔE2 is smaller. So the dominant uncertainty is ΔE1.

But the energy difference ΔE between E2 and E1 is what matters. If this ΔE is greater than the uncertainties of each state, then the two can be resolved. So perhaps the ΔE needs to be larger than either ΔE1 or ΔE2, whichever is larger.

Wait, but the correct condition is that ΔE must be greater than the sum of the uncertainties? Or is it that each uncertainty must be smaller than half of ΔE? Or something else.

Alternatively, the energy difference needs to be larger than the uncertainty in the energy measurements, which is probably the sum of the individual uncertainties, because each state's energy has its own uncertainty.

Wait, but each state's energy uncertainty comes from their own lifetimes. So when you're measuring, like in a spectroscopy experiment, the energy lines would have a certain width. The width is determined by the uncertainty ΔE. If the two energy levels are too close, their lines might overlap.

So the condition for distinguishable lines is that the energy difference between the two states (ΔE) is much larger than the uncertainties in each state's energy.
