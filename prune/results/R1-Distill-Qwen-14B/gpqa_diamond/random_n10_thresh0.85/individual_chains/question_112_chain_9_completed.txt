Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but let's try to tackle it. The question involves an electron state and some matrix operator. Let me read it again.

The state |alpha> is given as proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2 -i)|down>. |up> and |down> are eigenstates of the z-projection of spin. So first, I think I need to normalize this state because in quantum mechanics, states need to have a norm of 1.

Wait, the state is proportional, which means I need to find the normalization constant. The coefficients are (1+i) and (2 - i). The normalization would be the square of the magnitude of each coefficient, summed.

Calculating the magnitude squared for each term:

For (1+i), the magnitude is sqrt(1^2 +1^2)=sqrt(2). So squared is 2.

For (2 -i), the magnitude is sqrt(2^2 + (-1)^2) = sqrt(4+1)=sqrt(5). So squared is 5.

Adding them together, 2 +5=7. So the normalization factor is 1/sqrt(7). So |alpha> is (1/sqrt(7)) * [(1+i)|up> + (2 -i)|down>].

But wait, the problem says it's proportional, so we have to consider that when calculating probabilities.

Next, the operator has matrix elements A_ij where A_ij = hbar/2 if i != j, else zero. So the matrix is 2x2 since up and down are two states.

So the matrix looks like this: [[0, hbar/2], [hbar/2, 0]]. Because the diagonal elements are zero (since i=j), and off-diagonal are hbar/2.

Wait, wait, that's for a 2x2 matrix. So this operator is actually the Pauli X matrix multiplied by hbar/2. Because the Pauli X matrix is [[0,1],[1,0]], so when multiplied by hbar/2, it becomes this A.

So the operator is (hbar/2) * sigma_x, where sigma_x is the Pauli X matrix.

Now, the question is to find the probability of measuring the particle in each of the eigenstates of this operator. And also find the average value of the operator.

Wait, I think I need to find the eigenstates of the operator A. Because when you measure an operator, the possible outcomes are the eigenvalues, and the probabilities are the square of the amplitudes of the eigenstates in the given state.

Wait no, actually, when you measure an operator, the state collapses into one of its eigenstates, and the probability is the squared modulus of the inner product between the state and the eigenstate.

But the operator A is given, and we need to find its eigenstates. Alternatively, since A is proportional to sigma_x, which I know has eigenstates |+x> and |-x>, which are the eigenstates of the spin in the x-direction.

So, the eigenstates of A are the same as those of sigma_x, scaled by a factor, but since it's a multiple (hbar/2), the eigenstates remain the same because scaling doesn't change the eigenvectors, just the eigenvalues.

Wait, no. The operator A is (hbar/2) sigma_x. So the eigenvalues of A would be (hbar/2) times the eigenvalues of sigma_x. Since sigma_x has eigenvalues +1 and -1, then A has eigenvalues hbar/2 and -hbar/2.

But regardless, the eigenstates are the same as sigma_x's eigenstates. So |+x> and |-x> are the eigenstates.

So the state |alpha> is expressed in the z-basis, but we need to express it in terms of the x-basis to find the probabilities.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to calculate the probability by taking the inner product of |alpha> with each eigenstate of A, and then square the modulus to get the probability.

So, first, let me write down the eigenstates of A.

The eigenstates of sigma_x are (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2) and (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2).

Wait, right, because sigma_x is the Pauli X matrix, which swaps |up> and |down>. So its eigenstates are |+x> = (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2) and |-x> = (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2).

So for operator A, which is (hbar/2) sigma_x, the eigenstates are the same as sigma_x’s.

So, now, the state |alpha> is (1/sqrt(7)) [ (1+i)|up> + (2 -i)|down> ].

We can express |alpha> in the x-basis by taking inner products with the eigenstates.

Let me compute the inner product of |alpha> with |+x> and with |-x>.

First, let's compute the inner product with |+x>:

 <+x | alpha > = (1/sqrt(7)) [ (1+i) < +x | up > + (2 -i) < +x | down > ]

Since < +x | up> is 1/sqrt(2), and < +x | down> is 1/sqrt(2).

So,

= (1/sqrt(7)) [ (1+i)(1/sqrt(2)) + (2 -i)(1/sqrt(2)) ]

Factor out 1/sqrt(2):

= (1/(sqrt(7) * sqrt(2))) [ (1+i) + (2 -i) ]

Compute (1+i)+(2-i) = (3 + 0i) =3.

So,

= (3)/(sqrt(14)).

The probability is the modulus squared: (3)^2 / (14) =9/14 ≈0.6428 or about 0.64.

Similarly, the inner product with |-x>:

 < -x | alpha > = (1/sqrt(7)) [ (1+i) < -x | up > + (2 -i) < -x | down > ]

< -x | up> =1/sqrt(2), < -x | down> =-1/sqrt(2).

So,

= (1/sqrt(7)) [ (1+i)(1/sqrt(2)) + (2 -i)(-1/sqrt(2)) ]

Factor out 1/sqrt(2):

= (1/sqrt(14)) [ (1+i) - (2 -i) ]

Compute (1+i)-(2-i) = (1-2) + (i +i) = (-1) + 2i.

So,

= ( -1 + 2i ) / sqrt(14).

The modulus squared is [ (-1)^2 + (2)^2 ] /14 = (1 +4)/14 =5/14≈0.357.

Wait, but wait, probabilities should sum to 1. Let me check: 9/14 +5/14=14/14=1. So that's correct.

So the probabilities are 9/14 ≈0.64 and 5/14≈0.36.

Wait, looking at the options, option A says 0.64, 0.36, and average hbar/7. Option D has 0.61, etc. So A's probabilities are 9/14 (0.64) and 5/14 (≈0.357, which is close to 0.36).

So that would match option A for the probabilities.

Wait, but wait a minute, the probabilities are 9/14 ≈0.6429 and 5/14≈0.3571.

But the options have A as 0.64 and 0.36, which is the same as these. So that part would match option A.

Now, the second part is the average value of the operator A. The expectation value is given by <alpha| A |alpha>.

But wait, operator A is (hbar/2) sigma_x.

The expectation value would be (hbar/2) * < alpha | sigma_x | alpha >.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to compute <A> directly.

A is diagonal in the x-basis. Since |+x> and |-x> are eigenstates with eigenvalues hbar/2 and -hbar/2.

The expectation value is sum( p_i * lambda_i ), where p_i are the probabilities and lambda_i the eigenvalues.

So,

Expectation value <A> = (9/14)(hbar/2) + (5/14)(-hbar/2) )

= [ (9/14 -5/14) ) * hbar/2 ]

= (4/14) * hbar/2

Simplify 4/14 is 2/7.

So,

= (2/7) * (hbar/2) ) = hbar/(7) * (2/2) ? Wait, wait: 2/7 times 1/2 is 1/7.

Wait,

(9-5)=4, numerator.

So [4/14] * (hbar/2) = (2/7) * (hbar/2) )= (2 * hbar )/(7 * 2 )= hbar/7.

So expectation value is hbar/7.

Which matches option A's third part: hbar/7.

So the probabilities are 0.64 and 0.36, and expectation is hbar/7. So option A says 0.64, 0.36, and hbar/7.

But wait, let me look at the options again.

Option A: 0.64, 0.36 and hbar /7.

Yes, that's what I got.

But wait, the state |alpha> was given as proportional to that combination. Did I normalize it correctly?

Yes, because the sum of squares is 2 +5=7, so normalization factor is 1/sqrt(7).

So the state is correctly normalized.

Wait, another approach to compute the expectation value: compute <alpha| A |alpha>.

A is (hbar/2) sigma_x. Sigma_x is the Pauli X matrix.

So, in the z-basis, the matrix of sigma_x is [[0,1],[1,0]].

So, the state |alpha> is:

(1/sqrt(7)) [ (1+i) |up> + (2 -i)|down> ]

So as a vector, it's [ (1+i)/sqrt(7), (2 -i)/sqrt(7) ]^T.

So, to compute <alpha | A | alpha>:

A is (hbar/2) * [[0,1],[1,0]]

So,

<alpha|A|alpha> = (hbar/2) * [ (1+i)/sqrt(7) , (2 -i)/sqrt(7) ] * [[0,1],[1,0]] * [ (1+i)/sqrt(7) , (2 -i)/sqrt(7) ]^T.

Wait, let me compute this.

First, compute the product of the vector with the matrix.

The matrix multiplication would be:

[0*(1+i)/sqrt(7) + 1*(2 -i)/sqrt(7),
1*(1+i)/sqrt(7) + 0*(2 -i)/sqrt(7) ]

Which is [ (2 -i)/sqrt(7), (1+i)/sqrt(7) ]

Now, multiply by the conjugate transpose of the vector.

So,

( [ (1-i)/sqrt(7), (2 +i)/sqrt(7) ] ) * [ (2 -i)/sqrt(7), (1+i)/sqrt(7) ]^T.

Wait, no, the vector is [ (1+i)/sqrt(7), (2 -i)/sqrt(7) ]^T.

The conjugate transpose is [ (1-i)/sqrt(7), (2 +i)/sqrt(7) ].

So the inner product is:

(1-i)(2 -i)/7 + (2+i)(1+i)/7.

Compute each term:

First term: (1-i)(2 -i) = 1*2 +1*(-i) -i*2 +i^2* i?

Wait, (1-i)(2 -i) = 1*(2) + 1*(-i) -i*(2) + (-i)*(-i).

Wait, actually, compute it as (a - b)(c - d) where a=1, b=i, c=2, d=i.

= a c -a d - b c + b d.

= 1*2 -1*i -i*2 + i^2.

= 2 -i -2i + (-1) [since i^2=-1]

= 2-3i -1 = 1 -3i.

Second term: (2 +i)(1 +i) = 2*1 +2*i +i*1 +i*i.

= 2 + 2i +i +i^2.

= 2 +3i -1 = 1 +3i.

So sum the two terms: (1-3i) + (1+3i) = 2.

So the inner product is 2/7.

Multiply by (hbar/2):

< A > = (hbar/2) * (2/7) )= hbar/7.

So same result as before. So the expectation is hbar/7.

Therefore, the correct option is A: probabilities 0.64 and 0.36, average hbar/7.


The problem involves an electron state |α⟩, which is proportional to (1+i)|up⟩ + (2-i)|down⟩, where |up⟩ and |down⟩ are eigenstates of the z-projection of the spin operator. The goal is to calculate the probability of measuring the particle in each eigenstate of the operator A, whose matrix representation is given by A_ij = ℏ/2 if i ≠ j, and 0 otherwise. Additionally, the average value of the operator is to be determined.

### Step 1: Normalize the state |α⟩
The state |α⟩ is given as proportional to (1+i)|up⟩ + (2-i)|down⟩. To normalize it, calculate the squared magnitudes of the coefficients:
- For (1+i), the magnitude squared is \( |1+i|^2 = 1^2 + 1^2 = 2 \).
- For (2-i), the magnitude squared is \( |2-i|^2 = 2^2 + (-1)^2 = 4 + 1 = 5 \).

The total norm is \( 2 + 5 = 7 \), so the normalization factor is \( 1/\sqrt{7} \). The normalized state is:
\[
|α⟩ = \frac{1}{\sqrt{7}} \left[ (1+i)|\text{up}⟩ + (2-i)|\text{down}⟩ \right].
\]

### Step 2: Eigenstates of the operator A
The operator A has the matrix representation:
\[
A = \begin{bmatrix}
0 & \frac{\hbar}{2} \\
\frac{\hbar}{2} & 0
\end{bmatrix}.
\]
This is proportional to the Pauli X matrix (\( \sigma_x \)), with eigenvalues \( \pm \frac{\hbar}{2} \). The eigenstates of \( \sigma_x \) (and hence A) are:
\[
|+x⟩ = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \left( |\text{up}⟩ + |\text{down}⟩ \right), \quad |-x⟩ = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \left( |\text{up}⟩ - |\text{down}⟩ \right).
\]

### Step 3: Probabilities of measuring eigenstates
The probability of measuring the particle in each eigenstate of A is given by the squared modulus of the inner product between |α⟩ and the eigenstate. Compute the inner products:
1. With \( |+x⟩ \):
\[
⟨+x|α⟩ = \frac{1}{\sqrt{7}} \left[ (1+i)\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} + (2-i)\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \right].
\]
Simplify:
\[
⟨+x|α⟩ = \frac{1}{\sqrt{14}} \left[ (1+i) + (2-i) \right] = \frac{3}{\sqrt{14}}.
\]
The probability is:
\[
P(+x) = \left| ⟨+x|α⟩ \right|^2 = \frac{9}{14} \approx 0.64.
\]

2. With \( |-x⟩ \):
\[
⟨-x|α⟩ = \frac{1}{\sqrt{7}} \left[ (1+i)\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} - (2-i)\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \right].
\]
Simplify:
\[
⟨-x|α⟩ = \frac{1}{\sqrt{14}} \left[ (1+i) - (2-i) \right] = \frac{-1 + 2i}{\sqrt{14}}.
\]
The probability is:
\[
P(-x) = \left| ⟨-x|α⟩ \right|^2 = \frac{5}{14} \approx 0.36.
\]

### Step 4: Average value of the operator A
The expectation value of A is:
\[
\langle A \rangle = \langle α| A |α \rangle.
\]
Since A is diagonal in the x-basis, the expectation value can be computed as:
\[
\langle A \rangle = P(+x) \cdot \frac{\hbar}{2} + P(-x) \cdot \left(-\frac{\hbar}{2}\right).
\]
Substitute \( P(+x) = \frac{9}{14} \) and \( P(-x) = \frac{5}{14} \):
\[
\langle A \rangle = \frac{9}{14} \cdot \frac{\hbar}{2} + \frac{5}{14} \cdot \left(-\frac{\hbar}{2}\right) = \frac{\hbar}{7}.
\]

### Final Answer
The probabilities of measuring the particle in the eigenstates of A are approximately 0.64 and 0.36, and the average value of the operator is \( \frac{\hbar}{7} \). This matches **Option A**.

**Answer: A**
