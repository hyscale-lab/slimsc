Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here about density matrices. Hmm, I remember that density matrices are used to describe the state of a quantum system, especially when it's mixed. The question gives me a specific density matrix and asks about its geometrical position in qubit space. The options are four different r vectors in three dimensions.

Wait, the density matrix given is ρ = (1/2)(|0><0| + |1><1|). Oh right, I think this is a diagonal matrix. Let me write it out in matrix form. The |0><0| is a 2x2 matrix with 1 in the top left corner and zeros elsewhere. Similarly, |1><1| has 1 in the bottom right. So adding them together gives a 2x2 identity matrix, and then multiplying by 1/2 gives each diagonal element as 1/2. So the matrix looks like:

[ [1/2, 0],
  [0, 1/2] ]

I remember that for a single qubit, the density matrix can be represented in the Bloch sphere representation. The general form is ρ = (I + r·σ)/2, where σ are the Pauli matrices, and r is a vector (rx, ry, rz) that determines the point on the Bloch sphere. If the qubit is in a pure state, r has a magnitude of 1. For a mixed state, the magnitude is less than 1, possibly zero for a completely mixed state.

Wait, in this case, the given ρ is diagonal and both diagonal elements are equal. That suggests it's the maximally mixed state for a single qubit. The maximally mixed state would correspond to r being zero because all the off-diagonal terms are zero, and the diagonal terms are the same. Because for the maximally mixed state, the density matrix is (I)/2, which matches ρ here.

So, in terms of the Bloch sphere, r would be (0,0,0). Let me think about the general form again. If ρ is (I + r·σ)/2, then for the mixed state, if r is zero, ρ is I/2. So yeah, that fits.

Looking at the options, option C is r=(0,0,0). So the answer should be C.

Wait, but let me make sure. I think in the Bloch sphere representation, the vector r points from the origin to a point on the sphere (for pure states), but for mixed states, it's inside. The maximally mixed state should be at the center, so r is zero. That makes sense because there's no coherence and equal probabilities for |0> and |1>.

So I think the correct answer is option C.


The given density matrix is 

$$\rho = \frac{1}{2} \left( \left|0\right\rangle \left\langle 0\right| + \left|1\right\rangle \left\langle 1\right| \right).$$

In matrix form, this is:

$$
\rho = \begin{bmatrix}
\frac{1}{2} & 0 \\
0 & \frac{1}{2}
\end{bmatrix}.
$$

This is a diagonal matrix with equal diagonal elements, indicating it is the maximally mixed state for a single qubit. The maximally mixed state corresponds to the density matrix 

$$\rho = \frac{I}{2},$$

where \(I\) is the identity matrix. In the Bloch sphere representation, the state of a qubit is described by a vector \(r = (r_x, r_y, r_z)\), where \(r_x\), \(r_y\), and \(r_z\) are the components of the vector. For the maximally mixed state, there is no coherence, and the probabilities for \(\left|0\right\rangle\) and \(\left|1\right\rangle\) are equal. This corresponds to \(r = (0, 0, 0)\), as the vector lies at the center of the Bloch sphere.

Among the given options, the correct geometrical position in qubit space is:

**A) \(r = (1, 1, 0)\):** Incorrect, as this does not correspond to the maximally mixed state.  
**B) \(r = (0, 0, 1)\):** Incorrect, as this would represent a pure state along the \(z\)-axis, not the maximally mixed state.  
**C) \(r = (0, 0, 0)\):** Correct, as this represents the maximally mixed state at the center of the Bloch sphere.  
**D) \(r = (1, 1, 1)\):** Incorrect, as this does not correspond to the maximally mixed state.

Thus, the correct answer is:

**Answer: C**
