Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. Let me try to think through it step by step. I'm a bit new to this, so I might get a few things wrong, but I'll try my best.

The problem starts with 1,3-dibromoadamantane. I remember that adamantane is a diamondoid structure, like a diamond-shaped molecule. So 1,3-dibromoadamantane would have bromine atoms at the 1 and 3 positions. When this is heated with excess KOH, it probably undergoes an elimination reaction because KOH is a strong base. Elimination reactions usually form alkenes, right? So maybe it's a dehydrohalogenation, so two bromines leaving to form a double bond.

The product is a light yellow solid. The NMR data they gave is: 4.79 (2H), 2.41-2.23 (10H), 1.94 (2H). Also, the IR has a peak at 1720 cm-1. Wait, 1720 is a region for carbonyl groups. Oh, wait a second. If KOH is used, and if we're producing something, maybe it's not just elimination. Wait, KOH can also cause substitution. Wait, but 1,3-dibromoadamantane is symmetric, so if both Br are on adjacent carbons, perhaps the elimination forms an alkene. But then why the IR peak at 1720? That's more like a ketone or ester. Hmm, maybe I'm missing something.

Wait, maybe it's a elimination to form an epoxide? No, wait, no, because KOH isn't typically an oxidizing agent for that. Alternatively, perhaps it's a more complex reaction. Oh, wait! Heating with KOH could lead to a ring-opening. But adamantane is quite a rigid structure. Wait, maybe it's a di-elimination, forming a cyclohexene ring or something similar? Or perhaps the base abstracts a proton, leading to adjacent Br leaving, forming a double bond. Let's think about the product after KOH.

Alternatively, considering the IR, 1720 cm-1 is a strong carbonyl. So maybe the reaction isn't just elimination. Wait, 1,3-dibromoadamantane with KOH... maybe it's a substitution reaction. But if both Br are leaving, perhaps we get an oxide. Wait, no, substitution in such a molecule would require a good leaving group. Oh, wait, KOH might deprotonate and eliminate, but I'm a bit confused.

Wait, another thought. Maybe it's a dehydrohalogenation to form an alkene, but where? Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a pinacol-type rearrangement, but I'm not sure about that here. Alternatively, perhaps the product is a ketone. Wait, if we have two Br groups on adjacent carbons, maybe when KOH is added, it forms a conjugate base and then eliminates to form a carbonyl.

Wait, wait. If each Br is on a carbon adjacent to each other, removing two Brs and adding O from KOH could form a carbonyl group. Let me think: If it's 1,3-dibromoadamantane, and each Br is on a bridgehead carbon. When KOH is added, each bridgehead loses a Br and an H, perhaps forming a carbonyl. But wait, bridgehead carbons can't have double bonds in adamantane because of the structure. So maybe the elimination forms a ketone.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is an epoxide. But the IR then would have an O-H stretch, but maybe not. Wait, the IR has a peak at 1720, which points to a carbonyl.

Wait, another angle: the NMR after KOH. The 4.79 ppm (2H) is a singlet, maybe an OCH2 group. Or wait, 4.79 is a higher chemical shift, perhaps indicating an oxygen nearby. The 2.41-2.23 (10H) might be the bridgehead protons, and the 1.94 (2H) could be another set. Hmm.

Wait, maybe the product is 1,3-adamantanone? Because when you eliminate two HBr molecules, you might form a ketone. Adamantane has a structure where each bridgehead is a carbon attached to two CH2 groups. Oh, wait, but if the KOH causes both Br atoms to leave, perhaps forming a ketone in the center.

But wait, 1,3-dibromoadamantane would have Br on adjacent bridgeheads. Removing both Br would form an oxide? Or perhaps a diketone? No, that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, maybe each bridgehead loses a Br and a H, forming an alkene. But if the structure is such that elimination across the bridge would form a double bond, but in adamantane, the bridge is fixed. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a nucleophilic substitution where each Br is replaced by an -O- group, but that would form an ether, but the IR doesn't show an O-H.

Wait, but wait. The product after KOH has an IR peak at 1720 cm-1. That's a strong carbonyl, so likely a ketone. So perhaps the product is 1,3-diketone, but that seems unlikely with two Br atoms. Wait, maybe elimination of HBr twice, leading to a double bond? But then why the carbonyl?

Wait, perhaps the structure of 1,3-dibromoadamantane is such that when heated with KOH, it undergoes elimination to form an enol, which then tautomerizes to a ketone. But I'm not
