Alright, so I'm trying to figure out this organic chemistry problem. Okay, let's start by reading the question carefully. The compound has the molecular formula C8H9NO and some NMR data. Then, it's reacted through a series of reagents, and I need to determine the final product from the given options.

First, I'll look at the NMR data to figure out the structure of the starting material. The NMR spectrum has the following peaks:

- 9.72 ppm (t, 1H)
- 6.98 ppm (d, 2H)
- 6.51 ppm (d, 2H)
- 6.27 ppm (bs, 2H)
- 3.66 ppm (d, 2H)

Hmm. Let me think about each peak.

The peak at 9.72 ppm is a triplet. That's a high chemical shift, probably an aldehyde proton. Aldehydes usually show up around 9-10 ppm. So maybe there's an aldehyde group (CHO) in the molecule.

Then, looking at the aromatic region: 6.98 and 6.51 are both doublets. Two doublets suggest perhaps para-substituted aromatic rings. For example, in a para-substituted benzene, the protons on adjacent carbons would be as two doublets. Alternatively, maybe it's a di-substituted ring with substituents in the para positions.

Wait, but wait. If there are two doublets, each integrating to 2H, perhaps it's two different aromatic rings, each with a substituent. Like two phenyl groups attached to a central structure.

The 6.27 ppm peak is a broad singlet integrating to 2H. Broad singlet suggests maybe some exchange, like an -OH group or something with hydrogen bonding. Or perhaps it's a vinyl group in a conjugated system, but the broadness makes me think more of an -OH.

The 3.66 ppm peak is a doublet integrating to 2H. That's probably a CH2 group adjacent to something electronegative, like oxygen. Maybe an OCH2 group. Or perhaps a CH2 connected to an oxygen, like an ether or an ester.

Putting this together: the molecule might have an aldehyde group (from the 9.72 ppm peak), two aromatic rings (from the 6.98 and 6.51 ppm peaks), a CH2 group attached to an oxygen (3.66 ppm), and perhaps some hydroxyl groups (from the 6.27 ppm, but I'm not sure about that part yet).

Wait, another possibility: the 6.27 ppm could be two protons on adjacent carbons, perhaps in a conjugated system. Like a vinyl group next to an oxygen. Oh, maybe a di-substituted alkene with adjacent hydroxyl groups. Or maybe it's a di-substituted aromatic ring with some substituents.

Wait, but the molecular formula is C8H9NO. Let's calculate the degree of unsaturation. Degree of unsaturation = (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. Here, X=0, N=1.

So (2*8 +2 -9 -0 +1)/2 => (18-9+1)/2 = (10)/2=5. So five degrees of unsaturation. That could be, say, one ring (benzene, 3 double bonds is 4 degrees), wait, benzene has three double bonds (so three degrees), but a ring is one, making four. So the fifth would be another ring or a double bond or an alkyne, but alkyne is less likely.

Wait, maybe the molecule has a benzene ring and some other structures. Let me think.

Wait, the molecular formula is C8H9NO. Let me think about possible structures. Suppose it's a benzaldehyde derivative. For example, maybe the aldehyde is attached to a benzene ring, and there are other substituents.

Wait, the aldehyde is at 9.72 ppm, so maybe the structure has a benzaldehyde group.

Looking at the NMR again, the 6.98 and 6.51 ppm doublets: each is 2H. So perhaps two para-substituted benzene rings. For example, if the molecule has two phenyl groups attached to a central structure. So maybe a diphenyl compound.

Wait, but the molecular formula is C8H9NO. Let's think about possible structures. Let's count the carbons.

Suppose the molecule has two benzene rings. Each benzene has 6 C, but if they're attached to other parts, maybe it's not two separate rings. Hmm, but the formula is C8H9NO.

Wait, maybe the molecule is something like diphenylacetone? Let me check: diphenylacetone would be (Ph)2CO, which is C13H10O. But that's way larger than our formula. So not that.

Alternatively, maybe it's a cinnam
