Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's read it carefully.

The problem says: We have an isolated system of 13 identical particles, each with charge 2e and negligible mass. 12 of these are constrained to stay at 2 meters from a point P. The 13th charge is fixed at P. We need to find the minimum energy of this system, correct to three decimals, in Joules.

Hmm, right. So, first, I'm thinking about electrostatic potential energy. Because the system's energy is related to the arrangement of these charges. Since they're point charges and the system is isolated, the potential energy should be the sum of the potential energies between each pair of charges.

Wait, but the 13th charge is fixed at P, and the others are at 2m from P. So each of the 12 charges is 2 meters away from the 13th. Also, those 12 charges are at the same distance from P, but are they all at the same point or spread out around P? Oh, the problem says they're constrained to stay at 2 m from P, but their mutual distances from each other aren't specified. Hmm, but wait, each of the 12 is at 2m from P, but they might form a sphere or something. But wait, maybe I don't need their exact arrangement because the problem asks for the minimum energy. How do I arrange 12 charges around a central charge to minimize the potential energy?

Wait a second, I remember that for a set of charges around a central charge, the potential energy is the sum of each charge's potential due to all others. But wait, in this case, we have 12 charges each at 2m from the fixed 13th charge. So each of the 12 charges contributes a potential energy term with the 13th. But also, each of the 12 charges interacts with the others. But wait, the 12 are all at 2m from P, but how far apart are they from each other? If they are all at the same point, that would be zero distance apart, which is impossible because like charges can't be at the same point. So maybe they're arranged in a way that minimizes their mutual repulsion. Oh, perhaps they're placed on the surface of a sphere with radius 2m, each as far apart as possible. That would minimize their mutual potential energy because they are as far apart as possible, thus having the least repulsion. Because the potential energy between two charges is inversely proportional to the distance squared, so maximizing the distance would minimize the energy.

Wait, but wait. The problem is asking for the minimum energy of the system. So, what's the total potential energy in this setup?

So the total potential energy U would be the sum of two parts: the potential energy between the 13th charge (fixed at P) and each of the 12 charges, plus the potential energy between each pair of the 12 charges.

But wait, the 13th charge is fixed at P, and each of the 12 is at distance r=2m from P. So each of the 12 charges is at a distance of 2m from the 13th. So the potential energy between the 13th and each of the 12 is U_i = (k * q1 * q2) / r, where q1 is 2e, q2 is 2e, and r is 2m. Since there are 12 such interactions, the total for this part is 12 * U_i.

Then, for the 12 charges themselves, each pair contributes a potential energy term. Since each charge is 2e, the potential between two charges would be U_ij = (k * (2e)^2 ) / d, where d is the distance between them. But since all 12 are placed symmetrically on a sphere of radius 2m, the distance between any two charges would be the same. Wait, is that correct? No, actually, the distance between two points on the surface of a sphere depends on the angle between them. The maximum possible is when they're diametrically opposite, so d = 2r. But if they're arranged in a way to minimize the total potential energy, perhaps they are placed as far apart as possible. So, maybe the system is arranged such that each of the 1
