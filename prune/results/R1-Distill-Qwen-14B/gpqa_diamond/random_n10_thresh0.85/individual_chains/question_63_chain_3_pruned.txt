Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but let me try to work through it step by step. The question is about a diatomic molecule modeled by the quantum rotation-vibration model, also known as the non-rigid rotor model. The molecule is in its fundamental state, and we need to find the momentum of a photon that would cause it to switch to the next state with the lowest possible energy. 

Alright, first, let's parse the question. The molecule is composed of elements X and Y. Their masses are given: Mx is 20 amu, My is 2 amu. The bond length R is 2 angstroms, and the angular frequency w is 4e14 rad/s.

Wait, the question is about the momentum of the photon. Oh, right, in quantum mechanics, when a photon is absorbed, it provides energy to the molecule, causing a transition between energy states. But in this model, I think the molecule's energy states are a combination of rotational and vibrational energies. So the molecule is in the fundamental state, which I think is the lowest energy state. So when a photon is absorbed, the molecule transitions to the next possible state. But what's the next state?

Hmm, I remember that in the rigid rotor model, the energy levels are quantized. The energy levels are given by something like E_rot = B J (J+1), where B is the rotational constant and J is the rotational quantum number. And for a diatomic molecule, the rotational constant B is related to the moment of inertia I. Oh, right, I = μ R², where μ is the reduced mass of the two atoms.

Wait, but the problem mentions the non-rigid rotor model, so perhaps it's considering the vibration as well. Oh right, in the rotation-vibration model, the energy levels are a combination of rotational and vibrational contributions. But since the molecule is in its fundamental state, that might be the lowest vibrational state (v=0) and the lowest rotational state (J=0). Or wait, the fundamental state is the lowest energy state, which is typically the ground vibrational state with the lowest rotational state.

Wait, but the question says it's in the fundamental state. So the next possible state with the lowest energy—what does that mean? The next state could be either a higher vibrational state or a higher rotational state. But since vibrational energy levels are much more spaced out than rotational ones, the lowest energy transition would likely be from rotation. Or is it the other way around?

Wait, the energy difference for rotation is usually smaller than that for vibration. So if the molecule is in the ground state (v=0, J=0), the next possible state with the lowest energy would be increasing J to 1, because the rotational energy levels are lower in spacing than vibrations.

But wait, the problem says the molecule switches to the next state with the lowest possible energy—so perhaps, the photon's energy should cause the molecule to transition to the next state with the smallest possible energy increase. That would probably be the next rotational level if the vibrational energy is higher per quantum.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering that the molecule is in the ground state, which includes both the vibrational and rotational ground states. But when a photon is absorbed, the molecule can either increase its vibrational state or rotational state. But the next state with the lowest energy would be the one with the smallest energy difference. So we need to find the energy difference
