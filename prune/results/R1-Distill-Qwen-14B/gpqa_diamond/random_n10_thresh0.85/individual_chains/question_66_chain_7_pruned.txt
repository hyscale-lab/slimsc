Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about symmetries in the Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT). Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but let me think through this.

The question is asking which symmetries must be respected by all operators in SMEFT. The options given are Lorentz symmetry, Poincare symmetry, CP symmetry, and CPT symmetry. The choices are combinations of these.

First, I remember that SMEFT is a framework where you consider all possible higher-dimensional operators respecting the symmetries of the Standard Model (SM) up to some high energy scale. So the operators added in SMEFT must maintain the same symmetries as the SM.

Wait, what's the difference between Lorentz and Poincare symmetries? Lorentz symmetry is about local transformations of the coordinates (like rotations and boosts), while Poincare includes Lorentz plus translations. But wait, in the context of effective field theories, which symmetries are considered? Because effective theories are formulated in a background where Poincare is assumed, but I think in SMEFT, the operators must respect Lorentz symmetry.

Wait, but does that mean that all SMEFT operators must respect Lorentz symmetry? Because otherwise, the theory wouldn't make sense as a Lorentz-invariant theory. So Lorentz symmetry must be respected, so option 1 is in.

What about Poincare symmetry, option 2? Poincare includes both Lorentz and translation symmetries. But in an effective theory, translation symmetry (momentum space translation) is tied to energy and momentum conservation. SMEFT operators are local, so they should respect translation symmetry. So Poincare symmetry is also
