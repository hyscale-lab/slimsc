Okay, so I've got this problem about a diatomic molecule and the quantum rotation-vibration model. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think through it.

The question says that the molecule is in its fundamental state and absorbs a photon, causing it to switch to the next state with the lowest possible energy. I need to find the momentum of that photon. The options are given, so I'll have to figure out which one is correct.

First, I remember that in the quantum rotation-vibration model, the energy levels of a diatomic molecule are quantized. The molecule can be in different vibrational and rotational states. The fundamental state is the lowest energy state, which is usually the ground state of both vibration and rotation.

When a photon is absorbed, the molecule transitions to a higher energy state. The question is about the next lowest possible energy. So, I'm guessing that this transition would involve a change in either vibration, rotation, or both. But since the problem mentions the rotation-vibration model, maybe it's considering a transition that involves both aspects.

Wait, no. The question says "switch to the next state with the lowest possible energy." So the next state would be the next higher energy state overall. I think that in such models, transitions can involve changes in either vibrational or rotational energy, or both. But the fundamental state is the lowest, so the next state might be the next vibrational state or the next rotational state.

Wait, no. For diatomic molecules, the vibration is quantized in quanta of energy, while rotation is as well. The fundamental vibrational state is n=0, and the first excited is n=1. For rotation, the quantum number J starts at 0 and increases in integer steps. The energy levels for rotation are given by E_rot = B J (J+1), where B is the rotational constant.

But in the vibration-rotation model, the energy levels are a combination of vibrational and rotational states. The total energy is the sum of their contributions. The fundamental state is n=0, J=0. The next possible state could involve either increasing J by 1 (to J=1) or increasing n by 1 (to n=1, J=0). Which transition would require a lower photon energy?

Wait, because the question is about the next state with the lowest possible energy, the photon should provide just enough energy to make the smallest possible jump. So we need to find the transition that requires the least energy. That would be either the first rotational state (J=1, n=0) or the first vibrational state (n=1, J=0). Whichever requires less energy.

So I need to calculate the energies for these two transitions and see which is lower. Then the photon's energy should match that, and from there, find the momentum.

First, let's find the rotational energy difference. The rotational energy for J=0 is E_rot(0) = 0. For J=1, E_rot(1) = B * 1*(1+1) = 2B. So the energy difference ΔE_rot = 2B - 0 = 2B.

Then, the vibrational energy difference. The vibrational energy levels are given by E_vib(n) = (n + 1/2) h ν, where ν is the frequency. The fundamental state is n=0, so E_vib(0) = (1/2) h ν. For n=1, E_vib(1) = (3/2) h ν. So the difference is ΔE_vib = (3/2 - 1/2) h ν = h ν.

So which is smaller, 2B or h ν? Because if 2B is less than h ν, then the photon would cause a rotational transition. Otherwise, a vibrational transition.

So I need to find B and ν to compare.

Wait, the problem gives us the angular frequency ω = 4e14 rad/s. Angular frequency ω is related to ν as ω = 2π ν → ν = ω/(2π). So let's compute ν.

ν = 4e14 / (2 * π) ≈ 4e14 / 6.283 ≈ ~6.366e13 Hz.

Now, the rotational constant B is given by B = (h²)/(8 π² μ R²), where μ is the reduced mass of the molecule.

Hmm, so μ is the reduced mass, which is (Mx * My) / (Mx + My). Mx is 20 amu, My is 2 amu.

So μ = (20 * 2) / (20 + 2) = 40/22 ≈ 1.818 amu. Oh, wait, but amu needs to be converted to kg for SI units.

1 amu is approximately 1.6605e-27 kg. So μ = 1.818 * 1.6605e-27 kg.

Let me compute that: 1.818 * 1.6605 ≈ 3.024e-27 kg.

Wait, let me be precise. 1.818 * 1.6605:

1.8 *1.66 is about 2.988, but since it's 1.818 times 1.6605, let's compute:

1.818 * 1.6605 ≈ (1.8 *1.6605) + (0.018 *1.6605) 

1.8 *1.6605 ≈ 2.9889
0.018 *1.6605 ≈ 0.029889
Total ≈ ~3.018789e-27 kg.

Wait, no. Wait, 1.818 is 1818/1000, but wait, no, 1.818 is 1 and 0.818. So perhaps a better way is to compute 1.818 *1.6605.

1.818 *1.6605 = let's compute step by step:

1 * 1.6605 = 1.6605
0.8 *1.6605 = 1.3284
0.018 *1.6605 = approx 0.029889

Adding them up: 1.6605 +1.3284 = 2.9889 + 0.029889 ≈ 3.018789.

So μ≈3.018789e-27 kg.

Now, the bond length R is 2 angstroms. 1 angstrom is 1e-10 meters, so R=2e-10 m.

Now, B = h²/(8 π² μ R²).

What's h? Planck's constant is 6.626e-34 J·s.

So let's compute the numerator: h² = (6.626e-34)^2.

Calculating that: 6.626^2 ≈ 43.90 (since 6^2=36, 0.626^2≈0.39, and cross terms 2*6*0.626≈7.512 → total approx 43.90). So 43.90e-68 → 4.39e-67 J²·s².

Denominator: 8 π² μ R².

Compute each part step by step.

8 π² ≈ 8 * (9.8696) ≈ 78.9568.

μ R² = (3.018789e-27 kg) * (2e-10 m)^2.

(2e-10)^2 =4e-20 m².

So μ R² = 3.018789e-27 *4e-20 = 12.075156e-47 kg m².

Wait, 3.018789e-27 *4e-20 = (3.018789 *4) )e-47 → 12.075e-47.

Putting it all together, denominator is 78.9568 * 12.075e-47.

78.9568 *12.075 ≈ Let me compute:

78 *12 = 936; 78*0.075=5.85 → 941.85. But wait, more accurately:

12.075 *78.9568.

Let me compute 12 *78.9568 = 947.4816, 0.075 *78.9568≈5.92176, so total approx 953.40336.

So denominator ≈953.40336e-47 → 9.5340336e-45 (since 953e-47 is 9.53e-45).

Wait, wait: 78.9568 * 12.075e-47 = (78.9568 *12.075) ) *1e-47.

78.9568 *12.075 = let's compute:

12 *78.9568 = 947.4816

0.075 *78.9568 ≈5.92176

Total ≈ 947.4816 +5.92176= 953.40336.

So denominator = 953.40336e-47 = 9.5340336e-45.

Now, B = (4.39e-67) / (9.5340336e-45) ) → let's compute that.

Dividing 4.39e-67 by 9.534e-45 → approximately 4.39 /9.534 = ~0.46, and then exponents: 1e-67 /1e-45 = 1e-22.

So B ≈0.46e-22 J.

Wait, 0.46e-22 is 4.6e-23 J.

But wait, let me be precise.

4.39e-67 /9.534e-45 = (4.39 /9.534) *1e-22.

Compute 4.39/9.534: approx 0.46.

So B ≈ 0.46e-22 J.

So 2B = 0.92e-22 J.

Now, the vibrational energy difference ΔE_vib is h ν.

ν is 6.366e13 Hz.

h ν =6.626e-34 J·s * 6.366e13 Hz = 6.626e-34 *6.366e13.

Multiply 6.626 and 6.366: approx 42.33.

Exponents: 1e-34 *1e13 =1e-21.

So h ν ≈42.33e-21 → 4.233e-20 J.

Wait, 6.626 *6.366 is more accurately:

6 *6=36.

6 *0.366=2.196.

0.626*6=3.756.

0.626 *0.366≈0.229.

Adding up all the terms: 36 +2.196 +3.756 +0.229 ≈42.221.

So 42.221e-21 J → 4.2221e-20 J.

So comparing 2B ≈0.92e-22 J (which is 9.2e-23 J) and ΔE_vib ≈4.22e-20 J.

Which is smaller? 9.2e-23 is much smaller than 4.2e-20. So the rotational transition requires less energy. Therefore, the photon should cause a transition from J=0 to J
