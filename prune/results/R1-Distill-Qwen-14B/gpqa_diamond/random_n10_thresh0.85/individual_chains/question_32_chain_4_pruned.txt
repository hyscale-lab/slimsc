Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about calculating the energy of the RHIC when a certain nucleus is moving at 0.96c. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on relativistic mechanics, but let me think through this.

First, the nucleus in question is Li with 3 neutrons. Wait, Li is lithium. So, the standard lithium nucleus has 3 protons. If it has 3 neutrons, that makes it Li-6, right? Because 3 protons + 3 neutrons = 6 nucleons. So the mass number is 6.

So the nucleus is a Li-6 nucleus. I'll need the mass of Li-6. But wait, maybe I can find the rest mass using the general formula. Alternatively, perhaps I should just calculate using the rest mass of a proton and neutron, since Li-6 is composed of 3 protons and 3 neutrons.

Wait, but I think that the exact mass of the nucleus might be needed because when you have multiple particles, the binding energy comes into play. But for heavy ions like this, maybe the approximation of using the sum of individual rest masses is okay? Or perhaps the problem expects me to use the rest mass of the nucleus as a whole. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe the problem simplifies by using the rest mass of a proton and neutron. Oh, wait, but lithium-6 is 3 protons and 3 neutrons. So, each proton has a rest mass of about 938 MeV/c², and each neutron is about 939 MeV/c². Wait, but I should probably look up the exact values, but I think the proton is m_p ≈ 938.272 MeV/c² and neutron m_n ≈ 939.565 MeV/c². 

So, for Li-6, the total rest mass would be 3*(938.272) + 3*(939.565) ≈ let me calculate that.

3 * 938.272 = 2814.816 MeV
3 * 939.565 = 2818.695 MeV
Adding them: 2814.816 + 2818.695 = 5633.511 MeV, which is 5.6335 GeV.

Wait, but wait. The exact mass of Li-6 might be less than that because of the binding energy. I remember that the mass of a nucleus is generally less than the sum of its parts due to the mass defect and binding energy. Hmm, so perhaps I should use the actual known mass of Li-6.

I think the atomic mass of Li-6 is about 6.0121975 u. Oh wait, u is the atomic mass unit. 1 u is approximately 931.5 MeV/c². So, 6.0121975 u * 931.5 MeV/c²/u = let me calculate that.

6.0121975 * 931.5 ≈ let's see. 6 * 931.5 is 5589, but wait, 6 * 931.5 = 5589? Wait, no, 931.5 * 6 is 5589? Wait, 931.5 times 6: 931 *6 is 5586, 0.5*6=3, so 5589 MeV. But since it's 6.0121975, that's 6 + 0.0121975. So 0.0121975 * 931.5 ≈ 11.34 MeV. So total is approximately 5589 + 11.34 = 5600.34 MeV, which is about 5.60034 GeV.

Wait, but I've heard that the binding energy of light nuclei isn't that big compared to the rest mass of the nucleons. So, maybe using the individual masses isn't too bad an approximation. But perhaps I should proceed with the exact value.

Wait, another approach. Maybe I can find the rest mass energy of the nucleus, which would be M * c². So, M is the rest mass of the nucleus, X, which is Li-6.

So, M = (mass number) * (mass of a nucleon) - binding energy. But I'm not sure about the binding energy of Li-6. Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects me to just use the sum of the individual rest masses of protons and neutrons, since the binding energy is small compared to the total mass. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting me to model the nucleus as a single particle with mass equal to the sum of the individual nucleons. I think for the sake of this problem, perhaps we can model it as such.

So, mass M = 3*(m_p) + 3*(m_n). Let's compute that.

m_p is approximately 938.272 MeV/c², m_n ≈ 939.565 MeV/c².

So 3*(938.272 + 939.565) = 3*(1877.837) = 5633.511 MeV. So M = 5633.511 MeV/c².

Wait, but wait: 3 protons and 3 neutrons. So 3*(m_p + m_n) = 3*(938.272 + 939.565) = 3*(1877.837) = 5633.511 MeV/c².

So the rest mass energy E_rest is M c² = 5633.511 MeV.

Wait, but that would be 5.6335 GeV.

Okay, but perhaps the actual rest mass is lower. But I'll proceed with this approximation for now.

Wait, now, the problem says the speed v is 0.96c. I need to calculate the total energy of the nucleus, which is gamma * m c².

Gamma is the Lorentz factor, which is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²).

So v = 0.96c.

So, v² = (0.96)^2 c² = 0.9216 c².

So, 1 - v²/c² = 1 - 0.9216 = 0.0784.

Then, sqrt(0.0784) is sqrt(0.0784) = 0.28.

So gamma is 1/0.28 ≈ 3.57142857.

So gamma ≈ 3.5714.

Now, the total energy E is gamma * m c².

We have m c² as 5633.511 MeV, which is 5.633511 GeV.

So E = 3.5714 * 5.633511 GeV.

Let me compute that.

3.5714 * 5.633511.

Hmm, 3 * 5.6335 is about 16.9005.

0.5714 *5.6
