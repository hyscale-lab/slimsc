Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let's see what it says. The question is about the concentration of calcium ions in a solution containing 0.02 M stochiometric Ca-EDTA complex. The pH is ideal, and the temperature is 25°C. The K for the Ca-EDTA complex is given as 5x10^10. The options are A to D, and I need to pick the correct one.

Hmm, right. I remember that EDTA is a chelating agent. It forms complexes with metal ions, and the stability of these complexes is usually described by a formation constant, Kf. Wait, but wait, the problem gives K as 5e10. Is that the formation constant or the dissociation? Oh, right, K for the complex is the formation constant, Kf. So the reaction would be Ca²+ + EDTA^4- ↔ CaEDTA^2-.

Wait, no, wait. Let me think again. The formation constant (Kf) is for the reaction where the metal and EDTA combine. So Kf = [CaEDTA^2-]/([Ca²+][EDTA^4-]). Since Kf is large (5e10), the complex is very stable, meaning it doesn't dissociate much. So the concentration of free Ca²+ ions would be very low.

The problem states that the solution has 0.02 M of the Ca-EDTA complex. So the initial concentration of the complex is 0.02 M. The question is, what's the concentration of calcium ions in solution?

Wait, but if the complex doesn't dissociate much, [Ca²+] would be very low. So the answer should be a small number, perhaps one of the lower options.

Let me think about the expression. The Kf equation is Kf = [CaEDTA^2-]/([Ca²+][EDTA^4-]). Let me rearrange this. Since the complex is 0.02 M, that's [CaEDTA^2-] = 0.02 M. But wait, wait. Wait, because in solution, the EDTA is in different forms. At a certain pH, which is ideal here, I suppose that the EDTA exists predominantly as the Y^4- form. So I can assume that [EDTA^4-] is approximately equal to the total EDTA concentration.

Wait, but in the solution, the EDTA is part of the complex or free. Hmm, but in this case, because the complex is formed, the free EDTA (EDTA^4-) would be very low, but wait, no. Wait, the solution is 0.02 M Ca-EDTA. So the concentration of the complex is 0.02 M, and since each complex has one EDTA and one Ca²+, the EDTA in solution would consist of both the free EDTA and the EDTA bound in the complex.

Wait, but if the complex doesn't dissociate much, [Ca²+] would be very small, so the dissociation can be considered negligible. So the concentration of Ca²+ would be Kf^-1 multiplied by [CaEDTA^2-] multiplied by [EDTA^4-]. Wait, no, wait. Let me think again.

Wait, the Kf is [CaEDTA^2−]/([Ca²+][EDTA^4−]) = 5e10.

So, [Ca²+] = [CaEDTA^2−] * [EDTA^4−] / Kf.

But wait, if the solution is 0.02 M CaEDTA^2−, and assuming that the EDTA comes from the dissociation of the complex, but because Kf is large, the dissociation is minimal. So we can approximate [EDTA^4−] as being approximately the same as the total EDTA concentration, but wait, that might not be accurate. Alternatively, perhaps the solution has a very high concentration of EDTA, but in this case, the complex is 0.02 M, so I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps I should model it by considering that the total EDTA is equal to the sum of the free EDTA and the EDTA in the complex. But if the complex doesn't dissociate much, the free EDTA [EDTA^4−] would be very small compared to the complex concentration. Wait, no, wait. Wait, when you have a complex like this, the total EDTA is the sum of [EDTA^4−] and [CaEDTA^2−]. So if [CaEDTA^2−] is 0.02 M, and [EDTA^4−] is x, then total EDTA is 0.02 + x. But since Kf is large, [Ca²+] would be small. Let me see.

Wait, but the problem is that I don't know the concentration of free EDTA. Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the problem assumes that the concentration of free EDTA is in excess. But wait, in this case, the complex is 0.02 M, but if the solution is just the complex, then the free EDTA would be whatever comes from the dissociation. But given that Kf is 5e10, the dissociation is minimal. So let's make an assumption that [EDTA^4−] is approximately equal to [CaEDTA^2−] * (something), but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps I need to use the Kf expression and solve for [Ca²+]. Let's write the expression again.

Kf = [CaEDTA^2−] / ([Ca²+][EDTA^4−]) = 5e10.

We know [CaEDTA^2−] is 0.02 M. So, rearranging:

[Ca²+] = [CaEDTA^2−] * [EDTA^4−] / Kf.

But I don't know [EDTA^4−]. Hmm. Wait, but if the solution is 0.02 M Ca-EDTA, and if the EDTA comes from the dissociation of the complex, then the total EDTA would be [EDTA^4−] + [CaEDTA^2−] = [EDTA_total]. Wait, but I don't know the initial concentration of EDTA. Oh wait, wait. Wait, perhaps the solution is 0.02 M Ca-EDTA, so there's no free EDTA added. Hmm, no, that can't be right because EDTA is a hexadentate ligand, and when it forms a complex, it comes from the solution.

Wait, perhaps the solution is made by dissolving the Ca-EDTA complex, which dissociates a little into Ca²+ and EDTA^4−. So the total concentration of the complex is 0.02 M, but the free EDTA is [EDTA^4−], and the free Ca²+ is [Ca²+] = x.

So, the Kf expression is Kf = (0.02) / (x * [EDTA^4−]) ) =5e10.

But I don't know [EDTA^4−]. Hmm, but wait, the initial EDTA in solution is all in the complex. So the EDTA comes only from the dissociation of the Ca-EDTA complex. So [EDTA^4−] would be equal to [Ca²+] because each dissociation releases one EDTA and one Ca²+. So if [Ca²+] is x, then [EDTA^4−] is also x.

Wait, no, because the stoichiometry is 1:1. So for every mole of CaEDTA^2− that dissociates, it produces one mole of Ca²+ and one mole of EDTA^4−. So if the degree of dissociation is α, then [Ca²+] = α * 0.02, and [EDTA^4−] = alpha * 0.02.

But if the complex is very stable, alpha is very small. So let's set [Ca²+] = x, [EDTA^4−] = x.

So substituting into the Kf expression:

5e10 = (0.02) / (x * x) → 5e10 = 0.02/(x²).

So x² = 0.02 / (5e10) → x² = 2e-3 /5e10 → wait, no, 0.02 is 2e-2. So x² = 2e-2 / (5e10) = (2/5) * 1e-12 → 0.4e-12 → x² = 4e-13.

So x = sqrt(4e-13) = 2e-6.5? Wait, wait, sqrt(4e-13) is sqrt(4)*sqrt(1e-13) → 2 * 1e-6.5, which is 2e-6.5. Wait, 1e-6.5 is 3.16e-7, so 2 *3.16e-7 is approximately 6.32e-7.

Wait, that's about 6.3e-7 M, which is option C. So the concentration of Ca²+ would be approximately 6.3e-7 M. So the correct answer is option C.


To determine the concentration of calcium ions ([Ca²⁺]) in a solution containing 0.02 M stochiometric Ca-EDTA complex, we use the formation constant (Kf) for the complex, which is given as \( K_f = 5 \times 10^{10} \). The reaction is:

\[
\text{Ca}^{2+} + \text{EDTA}^{4-} \leftrightarrow \text{CaEDTA}^{2-}
\]

The formation constant expression is:

\[
K_f = \frac{[\text{CaEDTA}^{2-}]}{[\text{Ca}^{2+}][\text{EDTA}^{4-}]}
\]

Given that the concentration of the complex \([\text{CaEDTA}^{2-}]\) is 0.02 M, and assuming the solution is ideal with negligible dissociation of the complex, we can approximate \([\text{EDTA}^{4-}] \approx [\text{Ca}^{2+}] = x\), since the stoichiometry of the reaction is 1:1. Substituting into the \(K_f\) expression:

\[
K_f = \frac{0.02}{x^2}
\]

Rearranging for \(x^2\):

\[
x^2 = \frac{0.02}{K_f} = \frac{0.02}{5 \times 10^{10}} = \frac{2 \times 10^{-2}}{5 \times 10^{10}} = 4 \times 10^{-13}
\]

Taking the square root:

\[
x = \sqrt{4 \times 10^{-13}} = 2 \times 10^{-6.5} \approx 6.3 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M}
\]

Thus, the concentration of calcium ions in the solution is approximately \(6.3 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M}\), which corresponds to option C.

Answer: C
