Alright, so I've got this organic chemistry problem to solve. Let me think through it step by step. Okay, the question gives me a compound with the molecular formula C8H9NO and some NMR data. Then it goes through a series of reactions, and I need to figure out the final product. The options are A, B, C, D.

First, let me try to interpret the NMR data. The 1H-NMR spectrum has peaks at 9.72 (t, 1H), 6.98 (d, 2H), 6.51 (d, 2H), 6.27 (bs, 2H), and 3.66 (d, 2H). Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on NMR, but I'll try to piece this together.

The peak at 9.72 ppm is a triplet. That's a high chemical shift, so maybe an aldehyde proton. Aldehydes typically show up around 9-10 ppm. But wait, it's a triplet—what does that splitting mean? Maybe it's coupling with adjacent protons. Wait, but aldehydes usually have a singlet because they're at the end. Alternatively, maybe it's a conjugated aldehyde, like in a β-keto aldehyde or something. Or perhaps it's part of an enamine or another structure where the aldehyde is adjacent to a CH2 group. Hmm.

Looking at the other peaks: 6.98 and 6.51 are doublets, each integrating to 2H. Those are probably aromatic protons. The 6.98 is more downfield, so maybe para-substituted rings. Wait, 6.98 could be ortho to a substituent, or maybe meta. Alternatively, they could be part of a conjugated diene.

Then there's a peak at 6.27 (bs, 2H). Broad singlet. Maybe those are some vinyl protons, or possibly some hydroxyl groups? But hydroxyls are usually broader, but they could be exchanging and sometimes don't show up. Or maybe it's an aromatic proton that's part of an activating group. Wait, or maybe it's a conjugated diene's protons. Like in a butenone system or something.

The 3.66 ppm is a doublet for 2H. That seems like a CH2 group, perhaps attached to an electronegative atom, like oxygen. Maybe an OCH2 group. Alternatively, it's adjacent to an oxygen, like in an ether or ester. Wait, but in this case, the molecular formula includes an N. Let me see: C8H9NO. So, the molecule has one N. So, possible functional groups: aldehyde (from the high ppm), maybe a nitrile, amine, amide... Or perhaps an amine somewhere else.

Wait, the molecular formula is C8H9NO. Let's calculate the degree of unsaturation. Degree of unsaturation (DoU) is (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. C=8, H=9, N=1, X=0 (assuming no halogens). So DoU = (2*8 +2 -9 +1)/2 = (18-9+1)/2=10/2=5. So five degrees: could be a ring and some double bonds. For example, one ring and four double bonds? Or maybe a couple of rings and some double bonds.

Looking at the NMR, the 6.98 and 6.51 could be two different aromatic rings. Because each is a doublet of 2H, perhaps each is a para-substituted benzene. Like two para-substituted phenyl groups attached to something.

Wait, the 6.27 could be a vinyl group. Like in a conjugated system, maybe a dienone or something. So perhaps the molecule has two aromatic rings and a conjugated dienone or aldehyde.

Putting it together, perhaps the structure is something like two benzene rings connected through a conjugated system. Like a diphenyl compound with an aldehyde group and some double bonds.

Wait, the molecular formula is C8H9NO. Let me count the carbons: each benzene ring is 6 carbons, but wait, wait: wait, 8 carbons in total. So two benzene rings would take 12 carbons, which is way more. Hmm, so maybe it's not two benzene rings. Wait, wait, no, wait. Wait, C8H9NO. Let me think again. Maybe a benzene ring plus another substituent group containing the rest of the carbons.

Wait, perhaps it's a benzaldehyde derivative. For example, a benzene ring
