Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question says.

The question is about a substance X reacting with liquid Y. So, first, I need to figure out what X and Y could be. The reaction is violent and releases gas W. W's molecule has the same number of neutrons and protons. Hmm, that probably means W has an equal number of protons and neutrons. Wait, wait, no, the molecule as a whole has that property. Or maybe each atom does? I think it's each atom because the molecule's total counts would be the sum of all atoms, which is trickier. So, if the molecule has the same number of protons and neutrons, maybe it's something like H2O, but that doesn't fit because H has 1 proton, O has 8, but their neutrons would vary. Alternatively, maybe it's a noble gas? Like, for example, Argon has 18 protons and 22 neutrons in its most common isotope. No, wait, but that's for each atom. Oh wait, perhaps each molecule consists of one atom, so the gas would be a monoatomic gas where each atom has equal protons and neutrons. So, let's think about elements where the number of protons equals the number of neutrons. For example, carbon-12 has 6 protons and 6 neutrons. But wait, carbon is usually C-12, C-13, C-14. Or maybe another element.

Wait, another approach: the gas is released. Common gases in reactions are H2, O2, maybe CO2, but let's think about the properties. If W is a gas where each molecule has the same number of neutrons and protons, perhaps each atom has that. Let's list elements where protons equal neutrons. Let's see:

- Hydrogen: 1 proton, 0 neutrons (if it's H-1). Doesn't match.
- Helium: 2 protons, 2 neutrons (He-4). So He would have 2 each. That's one possibility.
- Carbon-12: 6 protons, 6 neutrons. So each C atom in the gas would have equal numbers.
- Oxygen-16: 8 protons, 8 neutrons. So O-16 fits.
- Sulfur-32? 16 protons, 16 neutrons. So S-32 would fit.

Wait, but what are the common gases? Helium is a noble gas, but it's monoatomic. So if W is He, then each He atom has 2 protons and 2 neutrons. That fits. So W is He.

But wait, another thought: if the molecule has the same number of protons and neutrons, maybe not necessarily each atom, but the total in the molecule. For example, if the molecule is CO2, then each C is 6 protons, 8 neutrons (assuming C-14), and O is 8 protons, 8 neutrons (O-16). So total protons would be 6 + 2*8 = 22. Neutrons would be 8 + 2*8 = 24. No, that doesn't match. Alternatively, maybe CO2 isn't the right choice.

Wait, another possibility: the gas is H2O. Then, each molecule has 2 H and 1 O. H has 1 proton each, O has 8. So total protons: 2 + 8 = 10. Neutrons: each H has 0, O has 8. So total neutrons: 0*2 +8 =8. No, 10 vs 8, not equal.

Alternatively, maybe the gas is O2. Each O atom has 8 protons and 8 neutrons (O-16). So each molecule has 16 protons and 16 neutrons. That would fit. So O2 would be a possibility.

Wait, but the problem says "the molecule has the same number of neutrons and protons." So if W is O2, each O has 8 protons and 8 neutrons, so in the molecule, 16 protons and 16 neutrons. So yes, 16 each. That works.

So W could be O2. Or maybe another diatomic gas like N2? Let's see, N has 7 protons. For N2, 14 protons. Neutrons would be 7 each for N-14 (since 14-7=7 neutrons). So each N atom has 7 protons and 7 neutrons. So in N2, 14 protons and 14 neutrons. That also fits. So W could be N2.

Hmm, but which one is it. Let's look for more clues.

The reaction is violent between X and Y, producing W and a precipitate G. When G is heated, it releases B, which has a melting point close to 277 K. 277 K is about 4 degrees Celsius (since 273 K is 0 C, so 277 is 4 C). So B has a melting point around 4 C. So what solid has a melting point near that? Maybe something like ammonium chloride? Or maybe water? Wait, water's melting point is 0 C, so that's 273 K. Hmm, 277 K is a bit higher. Maybe something else.

Wait, another thought. Maybe B is a solid with a melting point around 4 C. Alternatively, perhaps it's a different substance. Let me think about the precipitate G. When heated, it releases B. So G might be a carbonate? Because heating a carbonate often releases CO2 and leaves a metal oxide.

Alternatively, perhaps G is a sulfide, but that usually doesn't release a solid upon heating. Wait, maybe G is a hydroxide. Hmm, not sure.

Let me think about the other parts of the problem.

The product of the reaction of a certain keto acid with substance X contains 2 atoms of oxygen. Wait, that's a bit confusing. So when the keto acid reacts with X, the product has two oxygen atoms. Hmm, maybe the product is an ester or something. Alternatively, perhaps the product is something like a carboxylic acid salt.

Wait, another approach: what is substance X? The question says it's known for incorporating a heavier isotope of one of its constituent elements. So X has an isotope that's heavier than the most common. X is used as a reagent in organic chemistry, especially its analog. So maybe X is something like D2O (deuterated water) because it's used in reactions where isotopic substitution matters. Wait, but D2O is more about hydrogen isotopes. Alternatively, maybe it's something else.

Wait, another thought: X is a heavy water analog. So perhaps it's H2O where one H is replaced by deuterium (H has isotope with mass 2). Wait, but heavy water is D2O, which is a heavier isotope than normal water.

Wait, but the question says X is known for incorporating a heavier isotope of one of its constituent elements. So X has at least one heavier isotope. So perhaps X is something like H2O with one H as D, making it DHO or HD O.

Wait, but that's more about the hydrogen. Alternatively, maybe X is something else. Let's think about other possibilities.

Another angle: the product of a keto acid and X contains 2 oxygen atoms. Hmm, maybe the product is an acetal or something. Or perhaps it's an ester, but that might have more oxygen.

Wait, another thought: if the product is a hemiacetal or something else. Alternatively, perhaps the product is a secondary alcohol. Wait, but maybe the reaction is something like a Grignard reaction. Wait, Grignard reagents are organomagnesium compounds. But in that case, maybe the keto acid is reacting with an organometallic reagent.

Wait, but let's think about the reaction between X and liquid Y. The reaction releases gas W. So what could X and Y be?

If X is a heavy water analog (like D2O), and Y
