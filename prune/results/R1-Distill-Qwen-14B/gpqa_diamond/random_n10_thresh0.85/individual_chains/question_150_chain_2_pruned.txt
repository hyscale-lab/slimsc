Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me start by reading everything carefully.

The compound has the molecular formula C8H9NO. The NMR data is provided, and the compound undergoes a series of reactions. I need to determine the final product from the given options.

First, let's look at the NMR data. The 1H-NMR shows several signals:

- 9.72 ppm (t, 1H)
- 6.98 ppm (d, 2H)
- 6.51 ppm (d, 2H)
- 6.27 ppm (bs, 2H)
- 3.66 ppm (d, 2H)

I remember that the proton environment and splitting can tell us a lot. The 9.72 ppm peak is a triplet, and high up, which suggests it's an aldehyde proton. Aldehydes usually appear around 9-10 ppm, so that fits. The triplet might be because it's next to a CH2 group, but wait, the splitting pattern is tripletâ€”so maybe it's adjacent to another proton. Or perhaps it's part of an enal system, like conjugated with a double bond.

Looking at the other signals: 6.98 and 6.51 are doublets each integrating to 2H. Those look like aromatic protons. The 6.98 is probably para-substituted phenyl protons, as they are usually around 7 ppm. The 6.51 could be another para-substituted ring, but maybe with some substitution. Alternatively, maybe these are part of a benzene ring that's attached to an electron-withdrawing group, like nitro or carbonyl. Wait, but the molecular formula is C8H9NO, which includes a nitrogen and an oxygen.

The 6.27 ppm is a broad singlet for 2H. Broad signals can be due to exchange with protons, like -OH groups, but wait, it's integrating for 2H. Alternatively, maybe it's allylic protons or something else. But a broad singlet for 2H, perhaps they are on a benzene ring in a different environment, or maybe they're part of a double bond.

The 3.66 ppm is a doublet for 2H. That's around the region where OCH2 groups appear. So maybe a methylene adjacent to an oxygen, like an ether or an ester. Wait, but the molecular formula has only one O. Let me count the atoms:

C8H9NO. So 8 carbons, 9 hydrogens, 1 nitrogen, 1 oxygen.

Wait, maybe it's better to think about possible structures. Let me sketch this out.

The aldehyde proton suggests a carbonyl group. The OCH2 group is another part. So perhaps the molecule has a benzaldehyde part and another benzene ring with substituents.

Wait, let's think about the NMR again. The two doublets at 6.98 and 6.51, each 2H, could imply two para-substituted benzene rings. For example, two para-substituted phenyl groups attached to the main chain.

The triplet at 9.72 for 1H is probably the aldehyde proton. Then, an OCH2 group at 3.66 ppm. So maybe the structure is something like Ph-CH2-CHO, but with more substituents.

Wait, but the 6.27 ppm is a broad singlet for 2H. That's a bit tricky. Could that be another set of protons, perhaps on a double bond?

Wait, another possibility: the molecule has two benzene rings, each para-substituted, connected by a chain that includes a carbonyl group. Let's think about possible structures.

Looking at the options:

Option A: 2,4-diphenylbut-3-enal. Structure would be Ph-CH2-CH2-CH=CH-CHO? Wait, no, but but-3-enal is CH2=CH-CH2-CHO. Wait, diphenyl at positions 2 and 4. So the structure would be Ph-CH2-CH(Ph)-CH2-CHO? Wait, no, but but-3-enal is actually CH2-CH2-CH2-CHO with a double bond between carbons 3 and 4? Wait, no. But wait, but-3-enal would be CH2CH2CHO, but I'm getting a bit confused. Alternatively, perhaps it's Ph-CH2-CH2-CH=CHO with substituents. Hmm, perhaps not.

Alternatively, the structure might have a benzaldehyde group and another benzene ring attached through
