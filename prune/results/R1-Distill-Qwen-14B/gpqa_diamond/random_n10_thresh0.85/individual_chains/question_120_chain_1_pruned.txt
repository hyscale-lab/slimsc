Okay, so I've got this question about stars and their distribution in the sky. Let me try to think it through step by step. I'm not too sure about this, but I'll try to reason it out.

The question says that stars are uniformly distributed in the sky. I'm assuming that means they're spread out evenly in all directions, or at least that their distribution doesn't have any preferred direction. So, the density of stars is the same everywhere you look.

The main point is to figure out how the number of stars per unit range of parallax (plx) changes with plx. The options given are various inverse power laws of plx, like 1 over plx cubed, squared, etc. Hmm.

Wait, what's parallax? Parallax is a measure of distance. The closer a star is, the larger its parallax. Oh right, the formula for parallax is plx = 1/distance (in parsecs). So higher parallax means closer stars.

But wait, when we say "number of stars per unit range of parallax," that's like how many stars you'd expect in a slice of the sky that's a certain range in parallax. So for example, how many stars are there between plx = p and plx = p + Δp, for a small Δp.

Since the stars are uniformly distributed, their number density (stars per unit volume) is constant. Let me denote the number density as n (stars per cubic parsec, say).

But wait, how does the volume relate to parallax? Because distance is involved. Parallax p is 1/d, so d = 1/p. So if we have a slice of space between distance d and d + Δd
