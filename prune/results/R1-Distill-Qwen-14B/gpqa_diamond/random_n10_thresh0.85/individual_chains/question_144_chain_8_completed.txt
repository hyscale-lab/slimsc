Okay, so I've got this physics problem about meson resonance decay. Hmm, I remember that mesons are subatomic particles, right? And they can decay into other particles. The question is about finding the mean decay distance of a meson X. 

The given values are: production energy E_X is 8 GeV, mass m_X is 1.2 GeV, and width Γ_X is 320 MeV. The options are all in the order of 1e-15 to 1e-16 meters. I think the process involves calculating the lifetime of the meson and then using its velocity to find how far it travels before decaying.

Wait, right, the mean decay length is the product of the particle's lifetime and its velocity. So I need to find the lifetime first. How do I find the lifetime from the given width?

Oh, the width Γ is related to the particle's lifetime τ by the uncertainty principle. The relation is Γ = ħ / τ. So τ = ħ / Γ. But wait, I should be careful with units here. 

I remember that ħ (h-bar) is approximately 6.582 x 10^-25 GeV·s. But the width Γ is given in MeV, so I need to convert that to GeV. Γ_X is 320 MeV, which is 0.32 GeV. 

So τ = (6.582e-25 GeV·s) / (0.32 GeV) = 6.582e-25 / 0.32 ≈ 2.056875e-24 seconds. Wait, no, wait. Let me recheck the calculation. 6.582 divided by 0.32 is about 20.56875, so 6.582e-25 / 0.32 is 2.056875e-24 seconds? Hmm, wait, 6.582 /0.32 is roughly 20.56875, so 6.582e-25 /0.32 is 2.056875e-24 s. Yes, that seems right.

Next, I need to find the velocity of the meson. Since the meson is produced with energy 8 GeV and its rest mass is 1.2 GeV, I can calculate its gamma factor and then find beta (v/c), right?

The energy E is related to the rest mass m by E = gamma * m * c². So gamma = E/(m c²). Since E is 8 GeV and m is 1.2 GeV, gamma = 8 / 1.2 ≈ 6.6667. So gamma is about 6.6667.

Then, beta is sqrt(1 - (1/gamma²)). Wait, beta is v/c. So beta = sqrt(1 - (1/(gamma²))) = sqrt(1 - (1/( (8/1.2)^2 )) )? Let me compute that.

Wait, gamma is 8/(1.2) which is 6.6667. So gamma squared is (6.6667)^2 ≈ 44.4444. So 1/gamma² is about 0.0225. So 1 - 0.0225 is 0.9775. The square root of 0.9775 is approximately 0.9887. So beta is about 0.9887, which means v is approximately 0.9887c.

Wait, but wait, I think another way to find beta is using the relativistic relation between energy, mass, and momentum. Because E² = (pc)² + (m c²)². So p = sqrt( (E² - (m c²)^2 )) / c². Hmm, but maybe it's easier to use the gamma and beta relation.

Alternatively, since gamma = 8/(1.2) ≈ 6.6667, beta is sqrt(1 - (1/(gamma^2))) ) = sqrt(1 - (1/( (8/1.2)^2 )) ) = same as before.

So beta is approximately 0.9887.

Now, the mean lifetime is tau, and the velocity is v = beta * c. So the decay length L is v * tau.

Let me compute each part step by step.

Tau is approximately 2.056875e-24 seconds. Wait, earlier calculation: 6.582e-25 GeV·s divided by 0.32 GeV gives 2.056875e-24 s. Correct.

Velocity v is 0.9887 * c. c is 3e8 m/s. So v ≈ 0.9887 * 3e8 ≈ 2.966e8 m/s.

Then, L = v * tau = (2.966e8 m/s) * (2.056875e-24 s) = ?

Let me compute this: 2.966e8 * 2.056875e-24 = (2.966 * 2.056875) * 1e-16.

Multiply 2.966 and 2.056875. Let's do 2 * 2.966 is 5.932, 0.056875 * 2.966 is about 0.168. So total is approx 5.932 + 0.168=6.1.

Wait, more accurately, 2.966 * 2.056875.

Let me compute 2.966 * 2 = 5.932. 2.966 * 0.056875.

0.056875 is approximately 9/158 ≈ 0.05691. Let me compute 2.966 * 0.056875.

0.056875 is 56875e-6. So 2.966 * 56875 = ?

Hmm, 2.966 * 50,000 = 148,300.

2.966 * 6875 = let's compute 2.966 * 6,000 = 17,796; 2.966 * 875 = 2.966 * 800=2,372.8; 2.966 * 75 = 222.45. So 2,372.8 + 222.45 = 2,595.25. So total for 6,875 is 17,796 + 2,595.25 = 20,391.25.

So total for 56,875 is 148,300 + 20,391.25 = 168,691.25. So 168,691.25e-6 = 0.16869125.

So 2.966 * 2.056875 ≈5.932 + 0.16869125 ≈6.10069125.

So L ≈6.10069125e-16 meters.

Wait, but looking at the options: 

Option A is 5.0223e-16 m,

Option C is 5.0223e-15 m,

Option D is 4.0655e-16 m.

Hmm, none of them are around 6e-16. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, let me double-check the tau calculation.

Tau = ħ / Γ. ħ is 6.582e-25 GeV·s. Γ is 320 MeV, which is 0.32 GeV.

So tau = (6.582e-25) / 0.32 = let's compute 6.582 / 0.32 = 20.56875, so 20.56875e-25 GeV·s? Wait, no, wait: 6.582e-25 divided by 0.32 is 6.582e-25 / 0.32 = (6.582 / 0.32) * 1e-25 = 20.56875 * 1e-25 = 2.056875e-24 seconds. Correct.

Wait, but then L is v * tau. v is 0.9887c, so 0.9887 * 3e8 m/s = approximately 2.966e8 m/s.

So 2.966e8 m/s * 2.056875e-24 s = 2.966 * 2.056875e-16 m.

Wait, 2.966 * 2.056875 is approximately 6.1007. So 6.1007e-16 m. Hmm.

But none of the options match that. So perhaps I made a mistake in the beta calculation.

Wait, perhaps I messed up the calculation of beta. Let me recompute beta.

Gamma is 8 GeV / 1.2 GeV/c² = 6.6667.

Beta is sqrt(1 - (1/gamma^2)).

So 1/gamma^2 is 1/(44.4444) ≈ 0.0225. So 1 - 0.0225 = 0.9775. Square root of 0.9775 is around 0.9887. So that seems correct.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I should use a more precise calculation for beta.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute beta using the relation from energy and mass. Let me try that.

E^2 = (pc)^2 + (m c^2)^2.

So p c = sqrt(E^2 - m^2 c^4) / c^2.

Wait, let me compute pc.

E is 8 GeV, m is 1.2 GeV.

So E^2 = 64 (GeV)^2,

m^2 c^4 = (1.2)^2 (GeV)^2 = 1.44 (GeV)^2.

So (pc)^2 = 64 - 1.44 = 62.56.

So pc = sqrt(62.56) GeV ≈ 7.91 GeV.

So p = (7.91 GeV) / c^2 * c. Wait, no, p = (7.91 GeV) / c^2 * c? Hmm, I'm getting confused. Wait, let me think in terms of units.

Wait, E in GeV, m in GeV/c². So E = gamma m c^2. So when I write E^2 = (pc)^2 + (m c²)^2, this is correct.

So pc = sqrt(E^2 - (m c²)^2) = sqrt(64 - 1.44) GeV = sqrt(62.56) GeV ≈ 7.91 GeV.

So p = (7.91 GeV) / (c^2) * c = 7.91 GeV / (c). Wait, no, p is in GeV/c units.

Wait, p = (sqrt(E^2 - m^2 c^4)) / c² → but I'm getting confused. Let me use natural units where c=1 for a moment. In natural units, E^2 = p^2 + m^2.

So p = sqrt(E² - m²) = sqrt(64 - 1.44) ≈ 7.91 GeV.

Then, in terms of c, p = 7.91 GeV/c. So beta is (pc)/(E) → (7.91 GeV/c) / (8 GeV) ) → 7.91/8 = 0.98875. So beta is approximately 0.98875, same as before.

So that part's correct.

Hmm. So why does my calculation for L give about 6e-16 m, but none of the options are near that? Let me check the options again.

Wait, the options are:

A) 5.0223 * 10^-16 m

B) 4.0655 * 10^-15 m

C) 5.0223 * 10^-15 m

D) 4.0655 * 10^-16 m

Hmm, so none is around 6e-16. Did I make a mistake in the calculation of L? Oh wait, perhaps I messed up the exponents. Let me recompute 2.966e8 m/s * 2.056875e-24 s.

Wait, 2.966e8 * 2.056875e-24 = (2.966 * 2.056875) * 1e8 * 1e-24 = (6.1007) * 1e-16 m = 6.1007e-16 m.

But that's not matching any option. So perhaps I've made a wrong assumption. Another possibility: perhaps the decay distance is calculated differently. Maybe using the mean proper lifetime and the speed, but perhaps I confused the formula.

Wait, another approach: the mean decay length L is c * tau * beta. Because L = v * tau, which is beta c * tau.

Wait, tau is the proper lifetime (lifetime in the particle's frame), and when we observe it in the lab frame, the lifetime is longer by gamma, but wait, no: the lifetime we've calculated is the proper lifetime, because tau is the lifetime in the rest frame. Or is it?

Wait, no. The width Γ is the total decay width, which is related to the mean lifetime (tau) by tau = ħ / Γ. But tau is the mean lifetime in the rest frame, correct. So when the particle is moving, the lifetime observed is longer by gamma. So the lifetime in the lab frame is gamma tau. Because of time dilation.

Oh! That's a critical point I might have missed. So I think I made a mistake here. Let me recast.

In the particle's rest frame, the lifetime is tau = ħ / Γ. But in the lab frame, the lifetime is gamma * tau. So the moving particle's lifetime is longer.

So the decay length L is v * (gamma * tau) = v gamma tau.

Wait, but wait, v is beta c, so L = beta c * gamma tau.

Alternatively, since gamma = 1/sqrt(1 - beta^2), then L = beta c gamma tau.

Wait, let me compute that.

But another way: L = v * t, where t is the lifetime in the lab frame, which is gamma tau.

So L = beta c * gamma tau.

But gamma is 8 / 1.2 ≈6.6667.

Beta is 0.9887.

Tau is 2.056875e-24 s.

So L = 0.9887 * 3e8 m/s * 6.6667 * 2.056875e-24 s.

Wait, that's (0.9887 *6.6667) * (3e8) * (2.056875e-24) m.

Wait, let's compute 0.9887 *6.6667 ≈6.6. Because 6.6667 *0.9887 is about 6.6.

Then, 6.6 *3e8 = 1.98e9 m/s.

Multiply by 2.056875e-24 s → 1.98e9 * 2.056875e-24 = (1.98 * 2.056875) * 1e-15.

1.98 * 2.056875 is approx 4.0836 → so 4.0836e-15 m.

Wait, that's about 4.08e-15 m. Looking at the options, option B is 4.0655e-15 m, option C is 5e-15, option D is 4.0655e-16. So 4.08e-15 is closest to option B, which is 4.0655e-15 m. 

But wait, let me do the exact calculation.

Compute 0.9887 *6.6667.

0.9887 *6 =5.9322.

0.9887 *0.6667= approx 0.9887 *2/3 ≈0.6591.

So total is 5.9322 +0.6591=6.5913.

So 6.5913 *3e8 m/s = 1.97739e9 m/s.

Multiply by tau (2.056875e-24 s):

1.97739e9 * 2.056875e-24 = (1.97739 * 2.056875) * 1e-15.

1.97739 * 2.056875 = let's compute:

1.97739 * 2 = 3.95478,

1.97739 * 0.056875 ≈0.1124.

Total is 3.95478 + 0.1124≈4.06718.

So L≈4.06718e-15 meters. 

Looking at the options, option B is 4.0655e-15 m, which is very close. So the correct answer should be option B.

Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the assumption. So in the lab frame, the lifetime is longer by gamma, which is 6.6667, so the decay length is longer by that factor. Earlier, without considering the gamma, I was getting about 6e-16 m, but when I included gamma, it's about 4e-15 m, which matches option B.

So the correct approach is to calculate the proper lifetime, then multiply by gamma to get the lab frame lifetime, then multiply by velocity to get the decay length.


To determine the mean decay distance of the meson resonance \( X \), we start by calculating its lifetime \( \tau \) using the relation \( \tau = \hbar / \Gamma \). Given \( \hbar \approx 6.582 \times 10^{-25} \, \text{GeV·s} \) and \( \Gamma = 0.32 \, \text{GeV} \), we find:

\[
\tau = \frac{6.582 \times 10^{-25}}{0.32} \approx 2.056875 \times 10^{-24} \, \text{s}.
\]

Next, the velocity \( v \) of the meson is determined using its energy \( E_X = 8 \, \text{GeV} \) and mass \( m_X = 1.2 \, \text{GeV}/c^2 \). The Lorentz factor \( \gamma \) is calculated as:

\[
\gamma = \frac{E_X}{m_X} = \frac{8}{1.2} \approx 6.6667.
\]

The velocity \( v \) is then related to \( \gamma \) by \( \beta = v/c = \sqrt{1 - (1/\gamma^2)} \). Substituting \( \gamma \approx 6.6667 \), we find:

\[
\beta = \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{(6.6667)^2}} \approx \sqrt{1 - 0.0225} \approx \sqrt{0.9775} \approx 0.9887.
\]

Thus, \( v = \beta c \approx 0.9887 \times 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \approx 2.966 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \).

The mean decay distance \( L \) is given by \( L = v \cdot \tau \), but since the lifetime in the lab frame is dilated by \( \gamma \), we use:

\[
L = v \cdot \gamma \cdot \tau.
\]

Substituting \( v \approx 2.966 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \), \( \gamma \approx 6.6667 \), and \( \tau \approx 2.056875 \times 10^{-24} \, \text{s} \), we calculate:

\[
L = (2.966 \times 10^8) \cdot (6.6667) \cdot (2.056875 \times 10^{-24}).
\]

First, compute \( 2.966 \cdot 6.6667 \approx 19.774 \), then multiply by \( 2.056875 \times 10^{-24} \):

\[
L \approx 19.774 \cdot 2.056875 \times 10^{-16} \approx 4.067 \times 10^{-15} \, \text{m}.
\]

This value is very close to option \( B \), which is \( 4.0655 \times 10^{-15} \, \text{m} \). Therefore, the correct answer is:

**Answer: B**
