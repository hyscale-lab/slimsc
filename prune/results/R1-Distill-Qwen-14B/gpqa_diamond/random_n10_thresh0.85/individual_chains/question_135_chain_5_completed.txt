Alright, so I've got this physics problem here about the decay of a boson. Let me try to figure it out step by step. Okay, the question gives me a Lagrangian and some mass info, and I need to find out which decay channels are allowed kinematically.

The Lagrangian is written as L(y) = -λ f ψ_f bar (y) (ν + X(y)) ψ_f (y). Hmm, wait, I think that's a typo in the way it's written. Maybe it's supposed to be L(y) = -λ f ψ̄_f (y) (v + X(y)) ψ_f (y)? Oh wait, perhaps the ν is a typo for another term. Or maybe it's a typo and the actual term is X(y) plus something else. Wait, maybe it's actually the Yukawa coupling term. Because the standard Yukawa interaction is something like L = y ψ̄ φ ψ, where φ is a scalar field.

Wait the given Lagrangian is written as -λ f ψ̄_f (y) (ν + X(y)) ψ_f (y). So I think that's probably a Yukawa interaction term. So the field X is coupling to the fermion ψ_f with coupling λ f. The term (ν + X(y)) would then be the scalar field, but maybe ν is a typo and it's actually another field or a constant. Alternatively, perhaps the Lagrangian is written as L = -λ f ψ̄ ( ν + X ) ψ. So the boson X is interacting with the fermions via this term.

But the mass of X is given as 6 GeV. So I need to find the kinematically allowed decays of X into fermion-antifermion pairs.

Well, the mass of the boson is 6 GeV. For a decay X → f f̄ to be possible, the mass of X must be at least twice the mass of the fermion f. Because E=mc², so when the boson decays, each fermion gets some energy, but the minimum condition is that the rest mass of each is less than or equal to X's mass over two.

So first, I need to figure out which fermions have a mass less than or equal to 3 GeV. Because 6 GeV divided by 2 is 3 GeV. So any fermion with mass ≤3 GeV can be produced.

Let me think about the masses of the known fermions. Quarks come in different flavors and have different masses. But wait, the masses here are the current masses, right? So for quarks:

- Up and down quarks are the lightest. Their masses are around a few MeV. Up is about 2.2 MeV, down around 4.7 MeV. So way below 3 GeV.

- Strange quark is heavier, around 95-100 MeV. Still below 3 GeV.

- Charm quark is around 1.5 GeV.

- Bottom quark is around 4.5 GeV. Oh wait, that's about 4.5 GeV, which is more than 3 GeV. So the bottom quark is too heavy for X to decay into b b̄.

What about the top quark? No way, the top is like 173 GeV, way heavier than 3 GeV.

Other fermions are leptons:

- Electron: ~0.5 MeV, way below.

- Muon: ~105.7 MeV.

- Tau: ~1.78 GeV.

So the tau is below 3 GeV as well.

So the possible fermions that X can decay into are those with mass ≤3 GeV. Let me list all possible fermions:

Quarks:

u, d, s: All less than 3 GeV.

c: 1.5 GeV, which is fine.

But b is too heavy.

Leptons:

e, mu, tau: All are okay.

What about the others like the neutrinos? Well, the Lagrangian given includes terms with ψ_f, which I assume are charged fermions, because neutrinos are neutral. So perhaps the decay into neutrinos is possible too. But wait, the problem's interaction term is with ψ_f, which might be charged. Let me check the original Lagrangian.

Wait, the problem says "the interaction between the bosonic field X and fermions is given by..." So X can couple to any fermion. But the given Lagrangian is written as ψ_f, which might be Dirac fermions (so both charged and neutrinos are possible?) Or maybe the problem is considering only charged fermions, since the interaction term is written with ψ_f and ψ_f bar. Hmm, but in any case, the terms would include both charged and neutral fermions if they have the same quantum numbers.

But let's think about the possible decay products. Neutrinos have very tiny masses, so they can be considered as negligible. So X can decay into any of the fermion-antifermion pairs where each has a mass less than or equal to 3 GeV.

So possible fermions are:

Charged leptons: e, mu, tau (their masses are 0.5 MeV, 105 MeV, 1.78 GeV) → all are ≤3 GeV.

Quarks: u, d, s, c (their masses are around 2 MeV, 5 MeV, 100 MeV, 1.5 GeV) → all ≤3 GeV.

But b and t are too heavy.

So X can decay into pairs of these fermions.

Wait, but in the options, for example, option A includes b and s, but not c. Hmm, let me check the options.

Looking at the options:

Option A: X → b b̄, s s̄, u ū, d d̄, tau+ tau-, e+ e-.

Wait, but c is missing. But wait, the Lagrangian is written as L = ... (v + X) ... So the interaction is with X, but if the Yukawa term is present, then any fermion that the X couples to can be a decay product.

Wait, but in the question, the Lagrangian is given as L(y) = -λ f ψ̄_f (y) (v + X(y)) ψ_f (y). So this is a Yukawa coupling, and the X boson can interact with any fermion f that has a coupling λ_f. So X can decay into any fermion pair for which the coupling is present.

But wait, perhaps the fermions f in the Lagrangian are all possible fermions, but only those with mass less than 3 GeV can be decay products.

So the possible decay channels are all possible f f̄ where m_f ≤ 3 GeV.

So which fermions have m_f ≤3 GeV?

Quarks:

u: ~2.2 MeV

d: ~4.7 MeV

s: ~95 MeV

c: ~1.5 GeV

So all these are allowed.

But b is 4.5 GeV, so cannot.

Leptons:

e: 0.5 MeV

mu: 105.7 MeV

tau: 1.78 GeV

So all allowed.

So X can decay into any of these fermion pairs. So possible decay channels include: u ū, d d̄, s s̄, c c̄, e+ e-, mu+ mu-, tau+ tau-.

Wait, but in the options, option B is:

X→ c c̄, s s̄, u ū, d d̄, tau+ tau−, mu+ mu−, e+ e−.

Option D is X→b b̄, s s̄,... which includes b which is not allowed.

Option A includes b which is not allowed.

Option C includes c, but also t quark which is too heavy.

So the correct decay channels are all the f f̄ where f is u, d, s, c, e, mu, tau. So that's seven decay channels.

Looking at the options:

Option B: Includes c, s, u, d, tau, mu, e. That's all the allowed ones, except for the b which is excluded.

Wait, but what about the fermions with mass less than 3 GeV. The bottom quark is 4.5, so it's excluded.

So option B is X→c c̄, s s̄, u ū, d d̄, tau+ tau−, mu+ mu−, e+ e−.

Which is correct.

Wait, let me check the options again.

Option B says: X→c c̄, s s̄, u ū, d d̄, tau+ tau−, mu+ mu−, e+ e−.

Yes, that's all the allowed ones.

But wait, another point: The mass of X is 6 GeV. So the maximum possible mass for each fermion is 3 GeV. So as long as each fermion is ≤3 GeV, the decay is allowed.

So let me make sure I'm not missing any other fermion.

Are there any other particles that are fermions and have mass less than 3 GeV? Well, the known fermions are:

Quarks: u, d, s, c, b, t.

Leptons: e, mu, tau, and neutrinos.

But neutrinos have masses much less than 3 GeV, but I don't think the X would decay into neutrino-antineutrino pairs because the interaction in the Lagrangian is written as ψ_f, which might imply charged fermions. Or perhaps not.

Wait, the problem states that the interaction is between X and fermions. So if X can interact with neutrinos, then they could be decay products. But in the given Lagrangian, it's written as ψ_f, which could be any fermion, including neutrinos. But neutrinos are neutral, so in the Yukawa term, would X couple to them?

Wait, the Yukawa term is typically for charged fermions because the scalar field is neutral. So in the standard model, the Higgs couples to charged fermions via Yukawa interactions. Neutrinos are neutral, so they don't have a Yukawa coupling to the Higgs. But wait, in this problem, X is a boson, and the Lagrangian is written as ψ_f bar (y) (v + X) ψ_f. So if ψ_f is a neutrino, which is a left-handed particle, then the term would be ψ_f bar X ψ_f, but neutrinos are neutral, so that's possible.

Wait, but in the standard model, neutrinos don't have a Yukawa coupling because they are neutral. So in this problem, perhaps the Yukawa coupling is only to charged fermions. So the X can decay into neutrino-antineutrino pairs only if the Lagrangian includes such a term. But the problem statement is unclear on that. Alternatively, perhaps the given Lagrangian term includes all possible fermions, including neutrinos. Hmm.

But in any case, the mass of neutrinos is considered negligible, so even if X can decay into ν ν̄, it's allowed, but since their mass is so small, it's possible. But the options don't include neutrino decay channels. So perhaps the problem is only considering charged fermions.

Looking back at the options, none of the options include neutrinos. So perhaps the problem is considering only charged fermions as decay products.

In that case, the allowed decay channels are the charged leptons and the light quarks.

So in the options, the allowed ones are the ones that include c, s, u, d, tau, mu, e. So that's option B.

Wait, but let me check the options again:

Option A: includes b, which is not allowed.

Option B: includes c, s, u, d, tau, mu, e. All allowed.

Option C: includes c, s, u, d, tau, mu, e, and also t and b. But t is too heavy.

Option D: includes b, which is too heavy.

So the correct answer should be option B.

But wait, another point: does the interaction term allow for each of these fermions to decay? Like, does X couple to each of these fermions? Because in the problem, the Lagrangian is written as -λ f ψ̄_f (v + X) ψ_f.

So it's a Yukawa coupling for each fermion f with coupling λ f. So each fermion has its own coupling, and as long as the coupling exists, the X can decay into that fermion pair.

So assuming that λ f is non-zero for all these fermions, then the decay is allowed.

So the conclusion is that the kinematically allowed decays are all the fermion pairs where each fermion has mass ≤3 GeV. So the correct answer is option B.


To determine the kinematically allowed decays of the boson \( X \) with a mass of 6 GeV, we analyze the decay channels \( X \to f \bar{f} \), where \( f \) is a fermion. For a decay to be kinematically allowed, the mass of \( X \) must be at least twice the mass of the fermion \( f \), i.e., \( m_X \geq 2m_f \). Since \( m_X = 6 \, \text{GeV} \), the maximum allowed fermion mass is \( m_f \leq 3 \, \text{GeV} \).

### Step 1: Fermion Masses and Allowed Decays
The masses of known fermions are as follows:
- **Quarks**:
  - \( u \): \( \sim 2.2 \, \text{MeV} \)
  - \( d \): \( \sim 4.7 \, \text{MeV} \)
  - \( s \): \( \sim 95 \, \text{MeV} \)
  - \( c \): \( \sim 1.5 \, \text{GeV} \)
  - \( b \): \( \sim 4.5 \, \text{GeV} \) (too heavy)
  - \( t \): \( \sim 173 \, \text{GeV} \) (too heavy)
- **Leptons**:
  - \( e \): \( \sim 0.5 \, \text{MeV} \)
  - \( \mu \): \( \sim 105.7 \, \text{MeV} \)
  - \( \tau \): \( \sim 1.78 \, \text{GeV} \)

From this, the fermions with \( m_f \leq 3 \, \text{GeV} \) are \( u, d, s, c, e, \mu, \tau \). The bottom quark (\( b \)) and top quark (\( t \)) are too heavy to be decay products.

### Step 2: Interaction Term and Decay Channels
The interaction term given in the Lagrangian is:
\[
\mathcal{L}(y) = -\lambda f \bar{\psi}_f (y) (\nu + X(y)) \psi_f (y),
\]
where \( X \) couples to fermions \( \psi_f \). Assuming the coupling \( \lambda f \) is non-zero for all light fermions, the boson \( X \) can decay into any fermion-antifermion pair \( f \bar{f} \) where \( m_f \leq 3 \, \text{GeV} \).

### Step 3: Analysis of Options
- **Option A**: Includes \( b \bar{b} \), which is not allowed since \( m_b > 3 \, \text{GeV} \).
- **Option B**: Includes \( c \bar{c}, s \bar{s}, u \bar{u}, d \bar{d}, \tau^+ \tau^-, \mu^+ \mu^-, e^+ e^- \), all of which are allowed.
- **Option C**: Includes \( c \bar{c}, s \bar{s}, u \bar{u}, d \bar{d}, t \bar{t}, \tau^+ \tau^-, \mu^+ \mu^-, e^+ e^- \). The \( t \bar{t} \) channel is not allowed since \( m_t \gg 3 \, \text{GeV} \).
- **Option D**: Includes \( b \bar{b} \), which is not allowed.

### Conclusion
The kinematically allowed decays of \( X \) are \( X \to c \bar{c}, s \bar{s}, u \bar{u}, d \bar{d}, \tau^+ \tau^-, \mu^+ \mu^-, e^+ e^- \), which corresponds to **Option B**.
