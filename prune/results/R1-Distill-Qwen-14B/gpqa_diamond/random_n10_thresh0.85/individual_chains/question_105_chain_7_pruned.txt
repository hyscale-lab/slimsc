Alright, so I've got this astronomy problem here. Let me try to figure it out step by step. Okay, the question is about a star that's similar to the Sun, radius-wise. Half of its hemisphere is covered in dark spots, with a filling factor of 20%. The star's effective temperature is 6000K, and the spots are 1000K cooler, I think. The point is that when this star rotates, the spots come into and out of view, causing brightness variations that could look like an exoplanet transiting the star. The question is, what size exoplanet would cause the same brightness change?

Hmm, I remember that when a planet transits a star, the drop in brightness is proportional to the square of the planet's radius over the star's radius. So the formula is (R_planet / R_star)^2. Because the area blocked is proportional to that.

But in this case, the star's brightness variations are due to spots, not a planet. So I need to calculate the equivalent effect of those spots on the star's brightness and then see what planet size would mimic that.

Let me think about the star's brightness first. The star's total luminosity is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann law: L = 4πR²σT^4. But since only one hemisphere is spotted, maybe I should consider how the spots affect the observed flux.

The filling factor is 20%, which I think is the fraction of the hemisphere covered by spots. So the area blocked by spots is 0.2 times the area of the hemisphere. Wait, but the hemisphere is half the star's surface, right? So the total area of the star is 4πR², so the hemisphere is 2πR². So the spotted area is 0.2 * 2πR² = 0.4π R².

Now, the brightness variation comes from the spots being cooler. When a spot is facing us, it contributes less light than the surrounding area. So the change in flux when a spot is in view would be the difference between normal and spot emission.

The flux from a normal area is proportional to T^4. The flux from the spot is (T-1000)^4, where T is 6000K. So the difference per unit area is (6000^4 - 5000^4) per unit area.

The total change in flux when a spot is present would be the area of the spot multiplied by this difference. Wait, but let's see. When the star rotates, the spotted hemisphere comes into view, and then goes away as it rotates. So the total signal would be the sum of all the spots' effect.

Wait, perhaps it's better to compute the fractional change in brightness when the spots are visible. The maximum dip would be when the entire spotted hemisphere is in front. But since the star is rotating, maybe the effect is modulated as spots come into view.

But wait, the question says that the brightness variation is the same amplitude as a planet would cause. So the amplitude (the maximum dip) should be the same as that caused by a planet blocking part of the star.

So, the amplitude of the dip in brightness (due to spots) is the area of the spots as a fraction of the star's surface times the difference in brightness per unit area.

Wait, but the problem says the star's hemisphere is covered with spots; the filling factor is 20% for that hemisphere. So the total spotted area is 0.2 times the area of the hemisphere.

The hemisphere's area is (1/2) * 4πR² = 2πR². So the spotted area is 0.2 * 2πR² = 0.4πR².

Each spot is 1000K cooler than the star. So the flux from a spot is (5000/6000)^4 times the flux of the surrounding area.

So the flux difference per unit area is (6000^4 - 5000^4)/(6000^4) = 1 - (5/6)^4.

Calculating that: 5/6 is approximately 0.8333. (0.8333)^4 is around 0.8333^2 is about 0.694, then squared again is about 0.483. So 1 - 0.483 is about 0.517. So each spot's area contributes a 51.7% reduction in flux.

Wait, wait, no. Because the flux from the spot is (5000/6000)^4 of the star's flux. So the fractional drop per spot is (1 - (5/6)^4) which is about 0.517 as I said.

So the total fractional drop when the entire spotted area is in front would be (spotted area) * (fractional drop per area) / (total star area).

Wait, the total star area is 4πR². The spotted area is 0.4π R². So the fraction is (0.4π R²) * (1 - (5/6)^4) / (4π R²) ) = (0.4/4) * (1 - (5/6)^4) = 0.1 * 0.517 ≈ 0.0517, or about 5.17% dip.

But wait, no. Because when the star rotates, the spotted hemisphere comes into view, but the other hemisphere is normal. So when the star is viewed edge-on, the spotted hemisphere would cause a dip in the observed flux. The maximum dip would be the difference between the full star's flux and the flux when the spots are blocking.

Wait, actually, the star's total flux when spots are on the near side is (unspotted area flux) + (spotted area flux). So the flux with spots is [ (unspotted area * T^4) + (spotted area * (T-1000)^4) ) ] / (4π R^2).

But wait, the star's flux without any spots is (4π R²) * σ T^4 / (4π) ) = σ T^4 * R². Hmm, perhaps it's better to compute the fractional change.

The fractional dip when the entire spotted hemisphere is facing us is:

[ (unspotted area on near side) * T^4 + (spotted area) * (T-1000)^4 ] / [ total area * T^4 ]

Wait, the total area is 4π R². When the star is viewed such that the spotted hemisphere is the one facing us, the unspotted area on the far side is not contributing. Hmm, no, wait: that's not correct. The star is a sphere. The area you see from Earth is a hemisphere at any time. So when the star is rotating, the spots are on the near side (facing us) or not.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused here. Let me think again. The star emits light from its surface. When the star is viewed from Earth, we see one hemisphere. The other hemisphere is the backside, which we can't see. So if the star has a hemisphere that's spotted, when that hemisphere is facing us, the spots are in our line of sight, and the brightness drops. When it's facing away, the spots are on the far side, so we don't see them. So the brightness variation comes as the spotted hemisphere rotates into and out of view.

So, when the spotted hemisphere is entirely facing us, the area of spots is 0.4π R². The total area we see is 2π R². So the fraction of the visible area covered by spots is (0.4π R²) / (2π R²) ) = 0.2 or 20%—which is the filling factor. So that's correct.

So the flux without any spots would be 2π R² * sigma T^4. When spots are present, the flux is [ (2π R² - 0.4
