Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to think it through. Let me start by reading the question carefully.

So, the problem is about a star with certain parameters. Its radius is 1.5 solar radii, and its mass is 1.1 solar masses. When there are no dark spots on the surface, the effective temperature (Teff) is 6000 K. But when 40% of the surface is covered by spots, the overall photospheric Teff drops to 5500 K.

The main question is about the ratio of the number of neutral atoms of Titanium (Ti) in two energy levels, level 1 and level 2. They observe that this ratio decreases when the star has spots. And we're supposed to find the factor by which this ratio changes when the star doesn't have spots compared to when it does. The options are A to D, with numbers like 1.1, 7.8, etc.

Hmm. I remember that in stellar atmospheres, the ratio of populations in different energy levels can be described by the Boltzmann equation under Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE), which the question states is the case. So the key here is the Boltzmann factor.

The Boltzmann equation says that the ratio of the number of particles in two energy levels is given by:

n2 / n1 = (g2/g1) * exp( - (E2 - E1)/(k*T) )

Where:
- n2 and n1 are the number densities of the upper and lower levels,
- g2 and g1 are the statistical weights (degeneracy factors) of the levels,
- E2 and E1 are the energies of the levels,
- k is Boltzmann's constant,
- T is the temperature.

Since the question is about the ratio when spots are present versus when they're not, I think I need to calculate this ratio for both cases and then find the factor.

Wait, but the problem says that when the star has spots, the observed ratio decreases. So when the star doesn't have spots, the ratio is higher. We need the factor, which is ratio_without_spots / ratio_with_spots.

Let me denote the ratio as R = (n2/n1). So R0 is when the star is without spots (Teff=6000 K), and R1 is when the star has spots (Teff=5500 K). The factor is R0 / R1.

According to the Boltzmann equation, R = (g2/g1) * exp( - delta_E / (k T) ), where delta_E = E2 - E1 is the energy difference between the two levels.

Wait, but the problem gives a transition wavelength of approximately 1448 Å. That should correspond to the energy difference between the two levels. Because the energy of a photon is E = hc / lambda. So delta_E = hc / lambda.

Let me compute delta_E. But I need to be careful with the units. Let's see:

h is Planck's constant, which is 6.62607015e-34 J·s.
c is speed of light, 2.99792458e8 m/s.
lambda is 1448 Angstroms, which is 1448e-10 meters.

So delta_E = (6.626e-34 J·s * 2.998e8 m/s) / (1448e-10 m)

Calculating numerator: 6.626e-34 * 3e8 = approximately 1.9878e-25 J·m.

Divide by 1.448e-7 m (since 1e-10 m is 1 Angstrom, 1448e-10=1.448e-7 m):

1.9878e-25 / 1.448e-7 = approx 1.372e-18 J.

Wait, but that's per photon. Hmm. Alternatively, since energy is in terms of eV perhaps? Because in astrophysics, energy levels are often discussed in electron volts.

1 eV is 1.602e-19 J. So 1.372e-18 J is (1.372e-18) / (1.602e-19) eV ≈ 8.56 eV.

Wait, that's a big energy difference. Titanium has various ionization states, but as neutral Ti, I'm not sure if such a high energy transition is typical. But perhaps this is for ionized Ti? Hmm, but the question says neutral atoms, so it must be Ti I.

Wait, maybe I made a miscalculation. Let me re-calculate delta_E.

Wait, 1448 Angstroms is 1448 * 1e-10 meters = 1.448e-7 meters.

So delta_E = (6.626e-34 * 2.998e8) / (1.448e-7) 

Let me compute 6.626e-34 * 2.998e8 = 6.626 * 2.998 = approx 19.85, so 19.85e-26 J·m.

Divided by 1.448e-7 m: 19.85e-26 / 1.448e-7 = approx 13.72e-19 J.

Wait, 13.72e-19 J. To convert to eV: since 1 eV is 1.602e-19 J, so 13.72e-19 / 1.602e-19 = approx 8.56 eV. Hmm, that's a very high energy for a neutral Ti transition. Titanium neutral (Ti I) has energy levels that are in the optical range, I think. Wait, but 1448 Angstroms is in the near-ultraviolet. Hmm, maybe it's a permitted transition. But regardless, perhaps the calculation is correct for the purposes of the problem.

So delta_E is approximately 8.56 eV.

But wait, wait. Wait, the energy between levels is delta_E = hc/lambda. So I think the calculation is correct.

So, with delta_E known, we can compute the exponent in the Boltzmann factor. Let me write the ratio R for each temperature.

R0 = (g2/g1) * exp( - (delta_E) / (k T0) )
R1 = (g2/g1) * exp( - (delta_E) / (k T1) )

So the factor we're looking for is R0/R1 = exp( [ (delta_E)/(k T1) - (delta_E)/(k T0) ] )

Because when you take R0/R1, the (g2/g1) cancels out since it's the same in both.

So,

Factor = exp( delta_E/(k) [ 1/(T1) - 1/(T0) ] )

Wait, let me make sure: R0/R1 = [exp(-delta_E/(k T0)) ] / [ exp( - delta_E/(k T1) ) ] = exp( delta_E/(k) [ (1/(T1) ) - (1/(T0) ) ] )

Yes, that's correct.

So I can compute this exponent.

Let me compute the term inside the exponent.

delta_E is 8.56 eV, but I need it in Joules for the units to work out because k is in J/(K). So let's convert delta_E to J.

1 eV = 1.602e-19 J. So 8.56 eV = 8.56 * 1.602e-19 J ≈ 1.371e-18 J.

k is Boltzmann's constant: 1.380649e-23 J/K.

So delta_E/(k) = (1.371e-18 J) / (1.380649e-23 J/K) ≈ (1.371 / 1.380649) * 1e5 ≈ approximately 0.993 * 1e5 ≈ 99300 K.

Wait, 1.371e-18 / 1.38e-23 = (1.371/1.38) * 1e5 ≈ 0.994 * 1e5 = ~99,400 K.

So delta_E/(k) ≈ 9.94e4 K.

Then, 1/(T1) - 1/(T0) = 1/5500 K - 1/6000 K.

Let me compute 1/5500 ≈ 0.0001818 K^{-1}, and 1/6000 ≈ 0.00016667 K^{-1}.

So the difference is 0.0001818 - 0.00016667 ≈ 0.00001513 K^{-1}.

So the exponent becomes:

delta_E/(k) * (1/T1 - 1/T0) ≈ 9.94e4 K * 0.00001513 1/K ≈ 9.94e4 * 1.513e-5.

Let me compute that: 9.94e4 = 99,400, 1.513e-5 is 0.00001513.

So 99400 * 0.00001513 ≈ 99400 * 1.513e-5.

Let me compute 99400 * 1.513e-5.

First, 99400 is about 9.94e4, so 9.94e4 * 1.513e-5 = 9.94 * 1.513 * (1e4 * 1e-5) ) = (approx 15.03) * 0.1 = approx 1.503.

So the exponent is approximately 1.503.

So the factor is exp(1.503) ≈ e^1.503.

I know that e^1 is about 2.718, e^1.5 is about 4.4817, and e^1.6 is about 4.953. Let me compute e^1.503.

Wait, 1.503 is approximately 1.5, so e^1.5≈4.48. But let me get a more precise value.

Using a calculator, e^1.503 = ?

Alternatively, I can compute it as e^1.5 * e^0.003.

e^1.5≈4.4817, e^0.003≈1.0030045. So 4.4817 * 1.003 ≈ approximately 4.497.

So the factor is approximately 4.5, which is option C.

Wait, but let me confirm the calculations again because I want to be precise.

Wait, delta_E in eV is 8.56 eV. Let me recheck that.

Wait, earlier I calculated delta_E as 8.56 eV.

Wait, let me redo the calculation step by step.

Given lambda = 1448 Angstroms = 1448e-10 m.

Compute E = hc/lambda.

h = 6.62607015e-34 J·s

c = 2.99792458e8 m/s

lambda = 1.448e-7 m (since 1448e-10 = 1.448e-7 m)

So,

E = (6.626e-34 J·s) * (2.998e8 m/s) / (1.448e-7 m)

Calculating numerator: 6.626e-34 * 2.998e8 ≈ 1.986e-25 J·m.

Divide by 1.448e-7 m: 1.986e-25 / 1.448e-7 = approx 1.372e-18 J.

Convert to eV:

1 eV = 1.602e-19 J → 1.372e-18 J / 1.602e-19 J/eV ≈ 8.56 eV.

So that's correct.

Then, delta_E/(k) = 8.56 eV * (1.602e-19 J/eV) / (1.38e-23 J/K) ≈ (8.56 * 1.602e-19) / 1.38e-23.

Calculating 8.56 * 1.602e-19 = approx 13.71e-19 J.

Divide by 1.38e-23 J/K: 13.71e-19 / 1.38e-23 ≈ (13.71 / 1.38) * 1e4 ≈ 9.935 * 1e4 ≈ 99350 K.

So, delta_E/(k) ≈ 99350 K.

Then, 1/T1 - 1/T0 = (1/5500 - 1/6000) 1/K.

Compute each term:

1/5500 ≈ 0.000181818 ≈ 1.818e-4 K^{-1}

1/6000 ≈ 0.000166667 ≈ 1.6667e-4 K^{-1}

Difference: 1.818e-4 - 1.6667e-4 = (1.818 - 1.6667) * 1e-4 = 0.1513 * 1e-4 = 1.513e-5 K^{-1}.

So, the exponent is 99350 K * 1.513e-5 K^{-1}.

Compute 99350 * 1.513e-5:

99350 = 9.935e4.

So, 9.935e4 * 1.513e-5 → (9.935 * 1.513) * (1e4 * 1e-5) ) → (15.03) * 0.1 = 1.503.

So the exponent is 1.503. So e^1.503 ≈?

We know that:

e^1 = 2.71828

e^0.5 = approx 1.6487

So e^1.5 = e^1 * e^0.5 ≈ 2.718 * 1.6487 ≈ 4.4817.

But wait, the exponent is 1.503, which is a bit higher than 1.5.

Compute e^1.503: since 1.503 = 1.5 + 0.003.

We can use the Taylor expansion for small x: e^{a + x} ≈ e^a * (1 + x + x²/2 ... )

But x is 0.003, which is small. So e^{1.503} ≈ e^1.5 * (1 + 0.003 + (0.003)^2/2 )

e^1.5 is approx 4.4817.

Compute 1 + 0.003 + 0.0000045 = 1.0030045.

Multiply by 4.4817: 4.4817 * 1.0030045 ≈ 4.4817 * 1.003 ≈ 4.493.

So approximately 4.49.

Looking at the options, option C is ~4.5, which matches.

Wait, but why does the ratio decrease when the star has spots? Because when the temperature is lower (5500 K), the ratio n2/n1 would decrease. Because the exponent has a negative delta_E/(k T) in the Boltzmann factor. So when T decreases, the exponent becomes more negative, so the ratio R = n2/n1 decreases. So the ratio is lower with spots, so R0/R1 is greater than 1.

Which matches with our calculation of ~4.5.

So the correct answer is option C, ~4.5.


To solve the problem, we analyze the ratio of the number of neutral Ti atoms in two energy levels under the Boltzmann equation, which describes the population ratio in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE):

\[
\frac{n_2}{n_1} = \frac{g_2}{g_1} \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{kT}\right),
\]

where \(g_2\) and \(g_1\) are the statistical weights, \(\Delta E\) is the energy difference between the levels, \(k\) is Boltzmann's constant, and \(T\) is the temperature. The factor by which the ratio changes when the star does not have spots compared to when it has spots is given by:

\[
\text{Factor} = \frac{R_0}{R_1} = \exp\left(\Delta E \cdot \frac{1}{k} \left(\frac{1}{T_1} - \frac{1}{T_0}\right)\right),
\]

where \(T_0 = 6000 \, \text{K}\) (temperature without spots) and \(T_1 = 5500 \, \text{K}\) (temperature with spots).

### Step 1: Calculate \(\Delta E\)
The energy difference \(\Delta E\) corresponds to the transition wavelength \(\lambda = 1448 \, \text{Å} = 1.448 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{m}\). Using the relation \(\Delta E = \frac{hc}{\lambda}\), where \(h = 6.626 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J·s}\) and \(c = 2.998 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s}\):

\[
\Delta E = \frac{(6.626 \times 10^{-34})(2.998 \times 10^8)}{1.448 \times 10^{-7}} \approx 1.372 \times 10^{-18} \, \text{J}.
\]

Convert \(\Delta E\) to electron volts (\(1 \, \text{eV} = 1.602 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{J}\)):

\[
\Delta E \approx \frac{1.372 \times 10^{-18}}{1.602 \times 10^{-19}} \approx 8.56 \, \text{eV}.
\]

### Step 2: Compute \(\Delta E / k\)
Boltzmann's constant is \(k = 1.380649 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J/K}\). Thus:

\[
\frac{\Delta E}{k} = \frac{8.56 \, \text{eV} \cdot 1.602 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{J/eV}}{1.380649 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J/K}} \approx 99350 \, \text{K}.
\]

### Step 3: Compute the temperature term
The temperature term is:

\[
\frac{1}{T_1} - \frac{1}{T_0} = \frac{1}{5500} - \frac{1}{6000}.
\]

Calculate each term:

\[
\frac{1}{5500} \approx 0.0001818 \, \text{K}^{-1}, \quad \frac{1}{6000} \approx 0.0001667 \, \text{K}^{-1}.
\]

The difference is:

\[
\frac{1}{T_1} - \frac{1}{T_0} \approx 0.0001818 - 0.0001667 = 0.0000151 \, \text{K}^{-1}.
\]

### Step 4: Compute the exponent
The exponent in the factor is:

\[
\Delta E \cdot \frac{1}{k} \cdot \left(\frac{1}{T_1} - \frac{1}{T_0}\right) = 99350 \cdot 0.0000151 \approx 1.503.
\]

### Step 5: Compute the factor
The factor is:

\[
\text{Factor} = \exp(1.503).
\]

Using \(e^{1.5} \approx 4.4817\) and \(e^{1.503} \approx 4.49\), the factor is approximately \(4.5\).

### Conclusion
The ratio of the number of Ti atoms in the two energy levels decreases when the star has spots. The factor by which this ratio changes is approximately **4.5**, corresponding to option C.
