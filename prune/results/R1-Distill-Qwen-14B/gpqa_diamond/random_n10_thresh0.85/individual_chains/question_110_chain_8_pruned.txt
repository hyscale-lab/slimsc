Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me see what the question is asking.

The question is about which stars can be detected by both the ESPRESSO spectrograph at Paranal Observatory and the HIRES spectrograph at Keck Observatory. The key here is to determine the apparent magnitude each star has because each instrument has a different brightness limit.

First, I'll look at the parameters given for each instrument. ESPRESSO can observe stars with V magnitudes up to 17 mag. HIRES can only go up to 16 mag. So, a star must have an apparent V magnitude ≤16 to be detected by both, right? Because if it's brighter than 16, HIRES can't see it, but if it's brighter than 17, ESPRESSO can't. Wait, no, wait—brighter stars have lower magnitudes. So, the instruments' limits are: ESPRESSO up to 17 (so any star with V ≤17), HIRES up to 16 (so V ≤16). So, the star's apparent V magnitude must be ≤16 because that's the stricter condition. Because if a star is, say, V=15, both can see it. If it's 17, HIRES can't. If it's 16.5, HIRES can't because 16.5 is larger than 16, right? Wait, no, no. Because magnitudes work such that lower numbers are brighter. So, a star that's magnitude 16 is brighter than 17, so HIRES can see it (since it goes up to 16), and ESPRESSO can as well. A star at 16.5 would be too faint for HIRES but within ESPRESSO's limit. So for both to be able to detect, the apparent V mag must be ≤16.

Wait no, the question says "stars with apparent V magnitudes brighter than 17 mag can be observed" for ESPRESSO. Wait, that wording is a bit tricky. Oh, right, because lower magnitude means brighter. So, if the apparent V magnitude is brighter than 17, meaning V <17, ESPRESSO can observe. Similarly, HIRES can observe stars brighter than 16 mag, meaning V <
