Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about stars and their effective temperatures based on the excitation of iron atoms in their photospheres. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through step by step.

The question says that iron atoms in star_1's photosphere are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to star_2. So, star_1 has higher excitation. Oh right, excitation of atoms in a star's atmosphere is related to the temperature. The hotter the star, the more energy the atoms have, so higher excitation.

Wait, the energy difference between the energy levels is given as 1.38 x 10^-23 J. That must be the delta E value. Oh, right, when electrons get excited, they jump to higher energy levels, and the energy difference between those levels is what's given.

Since the photospheres are in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE), I can use the Boltzmann distribution equation. The Boltzmann equation relates the relative populations of two energy levels in a gas in thermal equilibrium. The formula I remember is (n2/n1) = exp(-ΔE/(k*T)), where n2 and n1 are the number densities of the higher and lower energy levels, ΔE is the energy difference, k is Boltzmann's constant, and T is the temperature.

In this problem, star_1 has twice as many excited atoms as star_2. Wait, no, more precisely, the excitation in star_1 is twice that of star_2. So the ratio of excited atoms (n2) to the lower state (n1) is 2 for star_1, and perhaps a different ratio for star_2.

Wait, no. Let me clarify. The problem states that the iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level when compared to star_2. So for star_1, the ratio of the excited state (n2) to the ground state (n1) is 2. For star_2, that ratio would be different. Let me think, if the excitation is lower in star_2, then its ratio would be lower.

But wait, actually, the ratio for star_1 is n2/n1 = 2, and for star_2, it's n2'/n1' which would be some other value. But how do these relate to each other and the temperatures of the stars?

Alternatively, maybe I should write the Boltzmann equations for both stars.

For star_1: n2_1 / n1_1 = exp(-ΔE/(k*T1))
For star_2: n2_2 / n1_2 = exp(-ΔE/(k*T2))

Wait, but the question says that the excitation is twice as much in star_1. So n2_1 / n1_1 = 2, and n2_2 / n1_2 = let's see, perhaps 1? Or another multiple? Maybe I misread it. Wait, the problem states that in star_1, the atoms are twice as excited. So if in star_1, the ratio is 2, and in star_2, perhaps it's 1, or maybe a different number. Wait, perhaps I should assume that in star_2, the ratio is 1. But that may not be correct. Alternatively, perhaps the ratio is 2 compared to star_2. Wait, the wording is a bit ambiguous.

Wait the problem says: "iron atoms in the photosphere of star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level when compared to the iron atoms in star_2." So, the excitation in star_1 is twice that in star_2. So, the ratio (n2/n1) would be twice as big for star_1 compared to star_2. Let me think: if star_2 has a ratio x, then star_1 has 2x.

Wait, but to model it, let
