Okay, I've got this question about crystallography, and I'm a bit rusty on the topic, but I'll try to think it through. So the question is about finding the interplanar distance for a (111) plane in a rhombohedral crystal. The given interatomic distance is 10 Angstrom, and all the angles are 30 degrees each.

Wait, rhombohedral crystals... I remember that they're a type of crystal system where all the edges are of equal length, and all the angles are the same. So the unit cell is a rhombohedron. The interatomic distance is the distance between atoms, right? But wait, in a crystal structure, the interatomic distance can sometimes be related to the lattice parameters. Hmm, maybe I need to find the lattice parameter 'a' first.

Wait, wait a second. Oh, right! The interatomic distance (d) in a simple cubic structure would be equal to the lattice parameter a. But in a rhombohedral structure, the atoms might not be at the corners of the cube, so the interatomic distance could be different. Hmm, no, wait. Wait, in a simple cubic structure, each atom is at the corner, and the distance between adjacent atoms is a√1, since it's just along the edge. But in a rhombohedral structure, assuming it's a primitive lattice, maybe the atoms are still at the corners. So perhaps the interatomic distance is the same as the lattice parameter 'a'?

Wait, no, wait. Wait, no, maybe not. Because in a rhombohedral structure, the unit cell is a rhombohedron, which is a three-dimensional figure with six faces, each a rhombus. So the interatomic distance might not be the same as 'a' if the atoms are placed differently. Hmm, but in the simple case, perhaps the interatomic distance is the same as 'a' because each atom is at the corner. Or maybe I'm mixing things up. Alternatively, perhaps the interatomic distance is given as the length of the edge of the rhombohedron, which would mean a = 10 Angstrom in this case.

Alternatively, maybe the interatomic distance is the distance between the nearest atoms. So in a simple cubic structure, d = a√1, because it's along the edge. But in a face-centered cubic or something else, it's different. Wait, but here it's rhombohedral, which is a type of cubic system with all edges equal and angles equal. So perhaps the structure is similar to a cube but with angles not 90 degrees. So the interatomic distance would still be a√1, so a =10 Angstrom.

Wait, but I'm not entirely sure. Maybe I should just proceed with a being 10 Angstrom. Because the question says interatomic distance is 10 Angstrom, so perhaps the lattice parameter 'a' is 10.

Now, the problem is to find the interplanar distance for the (111) plane. The formula for interplanar distance (d) in a crystal is given by the Bragg's law formula, but more precisely, the interplanar distance for a plane (hkl) is given by:

d = a / sqrt( (h^2 + k^2 + l^2) - (2hk cos α + 2hl cos β + 2kl cos γ) )

Wait, no, I think I got that wrong. Or wait, the more correct formula for interplanar distance in a crystal is:

d_{hkl} = a / sqrt( h² + k² + l² - 2hk cos α - 2hl cos β - 2kl cos γ )

Wait, but wait, in a cubic system with all angles equal, maybe the formula simplifies. Because in a cubic system, all the angles are the same. So α = β = γ = 30 degrees in this case.

Wait, but wait, in a cubic system, the angles are 90 degrees. Oh, wait, no! Wait, rhombohedral is a type of cubic system where the angles are all equal but not necessarily 90. So in this question, the angles are 30 degrees each.

So, I have a rhombohedral crystal with a = 10 Angstrom, angles α=β=γ=30°. The plane is (111), so h=1, k=1, l=1.

So putting into the formula:

d = a / sqrt( h² + k² + l² - 2hk cos α - 2hl cos β - 2kl cos γ )

Since all the angles are 30 degrees, cos 30° is sqrt(3)/2 ≈ 0.8660.

So let's compute the denominator.

h² + k² + l² = 1 + 1 + 1 =3.

Now the sum of the other terms:

-2hk cos α = -2*(1)(1)*cos(30) = -2*(0.8660) = -1.732.
Same for -2hl cos β and -2kl cos γ. Because h, k, l are all 1, and all angles are 30°, each of these terms is -2*(1)(1)*0.8660 = -1.732.

So total subtracting terms: -1.732 *3 = -5.196.

Wait, no. Wait the formula is h² +k² + l² minus [ 2hk cos α + 2hl cos β + 2kl cos γ ]

Wait, so the denominator is sqrt(3 - [2hk cos α + 2hl cos β + 2kl cos γ ] )

Wait, but wait, wait. Let me re-express the formula correctly.

The denominator is sqrt( h² + k² + l² - 2hk cos α - 2hl cos β - 2kl cos γ )

So for this case:

h=1, k=1, l=1.

Denominator becomes sqrt( 1+1+1 - 2*(1)(1)cos(30) - 2*(1)(1)cos(30) - 2*(1)(1)cos(30) )

Which is sqrt(3 - 2*0.8660 - 2*0.8660 - 2*0.8660 )

Wait, wait, no. Because each term is 2hk cos α, etc.

Wait, 2hk cos α = 2*1*1*0.8660 = 1.732.

Similarly, 2hl cos β is same, 1.732, and 2kl cos gamma is same, 1.732.

So the sum is 1.732 *3 =5.196.

So the denominator inside the sqrt is 3 - (1.732 *3) = 3 -5.196 = -2.196.

Wait, wait a minute, that can't be right because that would give a negative inside the square root, which is impossible. So I must have made a mistake in the formula.

Wait, perhaps I got the formula wrong. Let me think again. The formula for the interplanar distance in a crystal is derived from the general expression of the Miller indices. Alternatively, perhaps I should think about the formula as:

d = a / sqrt( (h^2 + k^2 + l^2) - 2(hk cos γ) - 2(hl cos β) - 2(kl cos α) )

Wait, wait, I think I made a mistake in the angles. Because in a general crystal, the angles between the axes are alpha, beta, gamma, but in the formula, the angles come into play when considering the dot products between the vectors. Maybe I should double-check the formula.

Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me try to find the correct formula.

The correct formula for the interplanar distance is derived from the plane equation. The formula is:

d_{hkl} = 1 / sqrt( (h a)^2 + (k b)^2 + (l c)^2 - 2 h k (a b cos γ) - 2 h l (a c cos β) - 2 k l (b c cos α) ) )

But wait, in a cubic system where a = b = c, and all angles are equal, this simplifies.

So substituting a = b = c = a, and angles α=β=γ=θ.

So the denominator becomes sqrt( [h² + k² + l²] a² - 2 a² [hk cos θ + hl cos θ + kl cos θ ] )

Taking a^2 common, denominator is a *
