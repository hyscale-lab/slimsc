Okay, so I have this question about stars being uniformly distributed in the sky and how the number of stars per unit range of parallax changes with parallax. Hmm, I remember that parallax is related to distance. Oh right, parallax (plx) is the reciprocal of distance in parsecs. So if a star is closer, its parallax is larger, and if it's farther, the parallax is smaller.

The question is about the number of stars per unit parallax. Wait, so I think it's about how the density of stars changes as we look at different parallax ranges. Since the stars are uniformly distributed, does that mean their actual density in space is uniform? Or is it that their apparent distribution on the sky is uniform?

Wait, uniform distribution in the sky—I think that refers to the stars being uniformly spread out in space, not just on the celestial sphere. So the three-dimensional distribution is uniform. So the number density of stars is constant throughout space.

Now, parallax plx is in arcseconds. The formula for plx is plx = 1/distance (d) in parsecs. So d = 1/plx.

To find the number of stars per unit range of plx, I think I need to find how many stars are in a shell between plx and plx + dplx. So the idea is to find the number of stars in a thin shell at a particular distance, and then see how that number relates to the parallax.

Let me think about the volume. The volume of a spherical shell at distance d with thickness dd is approximately 4πd² dd. Since the number density of stars is uniform, say n stars per cubic parsec, the number of stars in that shell would be n * 4πd² dd.

But wait, we need to express this in terms of parallax plx. Since d = 1/plx, let's substitute that in. So d = 1/plx → dd = - (1/plx²) dplx. But since plx is decreasing as d increases, I think when plx increases (meaning d decreases), the shell volume changes accordingly.

Wait, maybe it's better to express everything in terms of plx. Let me write:

Number of stars in a shell with parallax between plx and plx + dplx is N = n * 4πd² dd.

But d = 1/plx, so d squared is 1/plx². And dd is the change in d, which is (change in plx) multiplied by the
