Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics question about energy levels and their lifetimes. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but let's think through this.

The question says we have two quantum states with energies E1 and E2. Their lifetimes are 10^-9 seconds and 10^-8 seconds respectively. We need to find the energy difference so that they can be clearly resolved.

Wait, I remember something about the energy-time uncertainty principle. Oh right, the Heisenberg uncertainty principle states that ΔE * Δt ≈ ħ/2, where ħ is the reduced Planck's constant. So the uncertainty in energy depends on the time the state exists.

The lifetime is the Δt here, right? So for each state, the uncertainty in energy would be ħ divided by the lifetime. But wait, I'm a bit confused about which lifetime to use. Oh, wait, each state has its own lifetime. So the energy uncertainty for each state would relate to their respective lifetimes.

Wait, but the question is about the energy difference between E1 and E2. So we probably need to consider the uncertainty in each and then see if the difference is larger than the sum of the uncertainties? Because if the energy difference is much larger than the uncertainties, they can be distinguished.

Let me get the formula straight. The uncertainty principle is ΔE * Δt ≈ ħ. So ΔE ≈ ħ / Δt.

So for E1, Δt1 is 1e-9 seconds. So ΔE1 = ħ / Δt1.

Similarly, for E2, Δt2 is 1e-8 seconds. So ΔE2 = ħ / Δt2.

Wait, but since E2 has a longer lifetime, its ΔE would be smaller. Because as lifetime increases, energy uncertainty decreases. Because if a state exists longer, we know its energy more precisely.

So let's compute the numerical values. Let's get ħ in eV·s units. I think ħ is approximately 6.582e-16 eV·s.

So for ΔE1:
ΔE1 = 6.582e-16 eV·s / (1e-9 s) = 6.582e-7 eV.

Similarly, ΔE2 = 6.582e-16 / 1e-8 = 6.582e-8 eV.

Wait, but wait. Wait, the lifetimes are given as the lifetimes of each state. So each state has its own ΔE uncertainty. But when we're looking at the energy difference between E1 and E2, the total uncertainty would probably be the sum of the individual uncertainties, right? Because each contributes their own uncertainty when measuring the difference.

So the total uncertainty in the energy difference would be ΔE_total ≈ ΔE1 + ΔE2.

Plugging in the numbers: 6.582e-7 eV + 6.582e-8 eV = let's see, 6.582e-7 is 0.6582e-6, and 6.582e-8 is 0.06582e-6. Adding them gives approximately 0.724e-6 eV, which is 7.24e-7 eV.

So for the energy difference between E1 and E2 to be clearly resolved, the difference should be larger than this total uncertainty. So the energy difference ΔE = E2 - E1 should be greater than approximately 7.24e-7 eV.

Looking at the options:

Option A: 1e-9 eV → 0.001e-6 eV. That's way smaller than 7e-7. So no.

Option B: 1e-11 → even smaller. So no.

Option C: 1e-4 eV → 0.0001 eV. That's 1e-4 eV, which is way bigger than 7.24e-7. So yes, this is larger.

Option D: 1e-8 eV → 0.00001 eV. 1e-8 is 0.1e-7, so 1e-8 is 0.00000001 eV. Wait, 7.24e-7 is 0.000000724 eV. So 1e-8 is much smaller than that. So ΔE would have to be larger than 7.24e-7.

So the only option larger than that is C: 1e-4 eV.

Wait, but wait a second. Did I make a mistake in units? Let me double-check. Oh yes, 1e-4 eV is 10^-4 eV, which is much bigger than 1e-7 eV. So yes, it's sufficient.

So the energy difference would need to be larger than approximately 7e-7 eV. So any option with a difference larger than that is acceptable.

Looking at the options again, only option C is larger. So the correct answer should be C.


To determine the energy difference required to clearly distinguish the two quantum states with energies \( E_1 \) and \( E_2 \), we use the energy-time uncertainty principle:

\[
\Delta E \cdot \Delta t \approx \hbar
\]

where \( \Delta t \) is the lifetime of the state and \( \hbar \) is the reduced Planck's constant (\( \hbar \approx 6.582 \times 10^{-16} \, \text{eV·s} \)).

### Step 1: Calculate the energy uncertainty for each state
For \( E_1 \) with lifetime \( \Delta t_1 = 10^{-9} \, \text{s} \):
\[
\Delta E_1 = \frac{\hbar}{\Delta t_1} = \frac{6.582 \times 10^{-16} \, \text{eV·s}}{10^{-9} \, \text{s}} = 6.582 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV}
\]

For \( E_2 \) with lifetime \( \Delta t_2 = 10^{-8} \, \text{s} \):
\[
\Delta E_2 = \frac{\hbar}{\Delta t_2} = \frac{6.582 \times 10^{-16} \, \text{eV·s}}{10^{-8} \, \text{s}} = 6.582 \times 10^{-8} \, \text{eV}
\]

### Step 2: Total uncertainty in the energy difference
The total uncertainty in the energy difference \( \Delta E = E_2 - E_1 \) is the sum of the individual uncertainties:
\[
\Delta E_{\text{total}} = \Delta E_1 + \Delta E_2 = 6.582 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} + 6.582 \times 10^{-8} \, \text{eV} \approx 7.24 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV}
\]

### Step 3: Determine the energy difference required for resolution
To clearly distinguish the two energy levels, the energy difference \( \Delta E \) must be greater than \( \Delta E_{\text{total}} \). Comparing the options:

- **Option A: \( 10^{-9} \, \text{eV} \)**  
  \( 10^{-9} \, \text{eV} \) is much smaller than \( 7.24 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \). Not sufficient.

- **Option B: \( 10^{-11} \, \text{eV} \)**  
  \( 10^{-11} \, \text{eV} \) is even smaller than \( 10^{-9} \, \text{eV} \). Not sufficient.

- **Option C: \( 10^{-4} \, \text{eV} \)**  
  \( 10^{-4} \, \text{eV} \) is much larger than \( 7.24 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \). Sufficient.

- **Option D: \( 10^{-8} \, \text{eV} \)**  
  \( 10^{-8} \, \text{eV} \) is smaller than \( 7.24 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \). Not sufficient.

### Conclusion
The only energy difference that satisfies the condition for clear resolution is \( 10^{-4} \, \text{eV} \).
