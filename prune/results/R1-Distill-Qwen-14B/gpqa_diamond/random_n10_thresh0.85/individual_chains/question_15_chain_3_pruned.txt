Okay, so I'm trying to figure out which planet the researchers should observe based on the probability of a transit. Both planets are Earth-like, and they've been detected via the RV method, so we know their minimum masses and periods. But what's important here is the transit probability.

I remember that the probability of a planet transiting its star depends on the size of the planet's orbit relative to the star's size. Oh wait, more specifically, the transit probability is proportional to the ratio of the planet's orbital distance to the star's radius, but actually, I think it's R_star divided by the semi-major axis, but wait, no. Let me think. The transit probability formula is something like (R_star + R_planet) / a, but since R_planet is much smaller than R_star, maybe we can ignore it. So the probability is roughly (R_star) / (a), but wait, no, that's not right. Wait, no, the probability is (R_star / a) * (something else?), because the planet has to pass directly in front as seen from Earth. So the formula is (R_star / a) * (some function of the orbital inclination). Hmm. I think the transit probability is given by (R_star + R_planet) / a, but since R_planet is much smaller than R_star, we can approximate it as R_star / a. Wait, no, that's not correct. Let me get this straight.

Wait, no. The transit probability for a randomly oriented orbit is actually (R_star / a), because the planet's path in front of the star's disk is a small area, and the chance that it crosses our line of sight depends on the ratio of the star's radius to the distance of the planet's orbit. So if the star's radius is R, and the planet's semi-major axis is a, the probability is (R / a) multiplied by something else? Or is it (R / a) times 1/(something)?

Wait, no, I think the correct formula is (R_star + R_planet)/a, but again, since R_planet is small, it's approximately (R_star / a), but I'm not sure. Alternatively, I've heard that the probability is (R_star / (a)) * (something else). Or maybe it's (R_star / a) multiplied by 1/(something) like the impact parameter. Hmm, perhaps I'm mixing it up.

Wait, I think the correct formula for
