Okay, so I've got this question about quantum states and their energy differences. Hmm, the question says that two states have energies E1 and E2 with lifetimes of 10^-9 seconds and 10^-8 seconds. We need to figure out the energy difference that allows them to be clearly distinguished.

Wait, I remember something about the uncertainty principle. Oh right, the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle. It relates the uncertainty in energy and the uncertainty in time. The formula I think is ΔE * Δt ≈ ħ/2, where ħ is the reduced Planck constant. But wait, how does that apply here?

So, each quantum state has a certain lifetime, which is like the uncertainty in time Δt. The energy uncertainty ΔE is related to the lifetime. A shorter lifetime means a larger energy uncertainty, right? Because if the state doesn't last very long, we can't know its energy very precisely.

The goal is to have the energy difference between E1 and E2 be larger than the sum of their individual uncertainties. Otherwise, they might not be distinguishable. So the difference ΔE should be bigger than the uncertainty from each state.

Let me think about the formula again. The energy uncertainty ΔE for each state would be roughly ħ divided by the lifetime. So ΔE ≈ ħ / τ, where τ is the lifetime.

I think the reduced Planck constant ħ is about 1.0545718e-34 J·s. But sometimes people use units where ħ is 1, but I guess in this case, we need to compute it properly.

Wait, but the options are given in electron volts (eV). So I need to convert whatever calculation I do into eV.

First, let's compute ΔE for each state.

For the first state with τ1 = 1e-9 seconds:
ΔE1 ≈ ħ / τ1 = (1.0545718e-34 J·s) / (1e-9 s) = 1.0545718e-25 J.

Now, to convert J to eV. I remember 1 eV is approximately 1.60218e-19 joules. So:

ΔE1 = 1.05457e-25 J / (1.60218e-19 J/eV) ≈ 6.58e-7 eV.

Wait, wait, wait. Let me calculate that again. 1e-25 divided by 1.6e-19 is roughly (1/1.6) * 1e-6 ≈ 0.625e-6, which is about 6.25e-7 eV. So approximately 6.25e-7 eV.

Similarly, for the second state with τ2 = 1e-8 seconds:
ΔE2 ≈ ħ / τ2 = (1.05457e-34) / (1e-8) = 1.05457e-26 J.

Convert to eV: 1.05457e-26 / 1.60218e-19 ≈ 6.58e-8 eV. So about 6.58e-8 eV.

Wait, but wait, the energy difference ΔE between E1 and E2 is what? The question is asking which option is a possible energy difference so that the two states are clearly resolvable. So the energy difference (E2 - E1) should be larger than the sum of their uncertainties, because otherwise, the states might overlap in their energy distributions, making them indistinguishable.

Wait no, or is it that each state's own uncertainty is ΔE. So if the actual energy difference is larger than the sum of their individual uncertainties, then they can be distinguished.

Alternatively, maybe the energy difference should be larger than the maximum of the two uncertainties. Hmm, not sure. Let me think.

So, the uncertainty principle says that for each state, the energy uncertainty is about ħ/τ. So for state 1, the energy is uncertain by about 6.25e-7 eV, and for state 2, about 6.58e-8 eV.

The energy difference between E1 and E2 must be greater than the sum of these uncertainties. Because if the actual difference is smaller than the sum, their energy ranges might overlap, making it impossible
