Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question again. 

The question is about identifying the product when Compound X reacts with red phosphorus and HI. They've given me the IR and NMR data for Compound X. The options are A to D, which are various organic compounds.

First, I need to figure out what Compound X is. Once I know that, I can determine what happens when it reacts with red phosphorus and HI. Wait, red phosphorus and HI... Oh, right! That's a reaction to reduce a carbonyl group. So, if Compound X has a carbonyl, like a ketone or ester or something, reacting with red phosphorus and HI would typically reduce it. For example, esters might be reduced to alcohols, or maybe ketones to secondary alcohols.

Let me look at the IR data first. The IR peaks: 3400â€“2500 cm-1. That's a broad region, probably O-H or N-H stretch. But since there's a peak at 1720 cm-1, which is a strong carbonyl (C=O) stretch. The 1610 and 1450 cm-1 might be aromatic C=C stretching. So, the compound likely has an aromatic ring and a carbonyl group. The O-H could be from a carboxylic acid, but also maybe an alcohol or something else.

Now the NMR: Let's list the peaks. 

10.5 ppm (bs, 1H): That's a broad singlet, probably an O-H proton. If it's a carboxylic acid, that's typical. Alternatively, an alcohol's O-H can be broad, but in a carboxylic acid, the O-H is usually broader and appears around 10-12 ppm.

8.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.2 ppm (d, 2H): These are doublets, likely from a para-substituted benzene ring. So the aromatic protons are split into two sets, each as doublets. That suggests a substituent on the benzene ring in the para position, so maybe two substituents in the para positions or one substituent that's two substituents? Hmm, wait, for a para-substituted benzene with two substituents, each substituent would cause the protons to be in two doublets. Or perhaps a single substituent with two protons, but that doesn't make much sense. Wait, the coupling for para is usually with two protons each, leading to a doublet for each set. So perhaps a substituent in the para position. Like a meta substituent would lead to more splitting, but para is more symmetrical.

So let's imagine a benzene ring with substituents at para positions. Wait, but wait, the NMR shows two sets of doublets. So maybe the substituents are at para positions, but each substituent has different chemical environments. Or perhaps the substituent is a group that causes the ring to have two equivalent protons in one position and two in another. For example, if the ring has two substituents at the para positions, each substituent would have two protons adjacent that are equivalent. But wait, in a para-disubstituted benzene, the protons adjacent to each substituent are equivalent. So perhaps each substituent is in para, and the H on each side are equivalent, but the substituents are different? Or maybe the substituents are same. Hmm, not sure yet.

Moving on. The next peaks are 2.9 ppm (m, 1H), which is a multiplet. Maybe a CH group next to an electronegative atom or in a chiral center. 1.7 ppm (m, 2H) could be a CH2 group adjacent to something, maybe near an oxygen or another group. 1.4 ppm (d, 3H): A triplet of three protons, probably a methyl group attached to something, maybe a CH2 that's next to a branch. 0.9 ppm (t, 3H): A terminal CH3 group, like at the end of an ethyl chain.

Putting this together, the NMR suggests a molecule with a benzene ring (from the aromatic peaks) substituted in a para position, and then a side chain attached. The 10.5 ppm peak suggests something acidic, so maybe a carboxylic acid group attached to the benzene. But wait, wait: if the IR shows 1720 cm-1, that's a carbonyl. A carboxylic acid would have an O-H stretch around 2500-3300 cm-1 (broad) and a carbonyl around 1700. So the IR matches a carboxylic acid.

Wait, but the NMR shows a peak at 10.5 ppm, which is consistent with a carboxylic acid's O-H. So that suggests that the compound is a benzoic acid derivative.

So, putting the pieces together:
