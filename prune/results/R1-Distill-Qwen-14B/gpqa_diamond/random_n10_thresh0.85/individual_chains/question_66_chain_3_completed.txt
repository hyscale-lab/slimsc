Okay, so I've got this question about the Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT) and which symmetries the operators must respect. I'm a bit new to this, so I'll try to break it down step by step.

First, the question is asking which symmetries must be respected by all operators in SMEFT. The options are Lorentz, Poincare, CP, and CPT. The choices are combinations of these, so I need to figure out which ones are absolutely necessary.

I remember that SMEFT is a framework where you write down all possible operators (interactions) that can be formed with the Standard Model fields, but with higher dimensionality, right? Each operator is suppressed by some high energy scale, like the Planck scale or something. The idea is that these operators parameterize possible new physics beyond the Standard Model.

Now, symmetries in physics dictate the form of the laws. If a theory respects a symmetry, then the equations are invariant under that symmetry transformation. So, when building the SMEFT Lagrangian, which operators are allowed? Well, they must be in agreement with the underlying symmetries of the Standard Model, I think. Because SMEFT is an effective theory that incorporates the SM as a subset, any operator added must not violate the SM's symmetries.

Let me think about each symmetry:

1. **Lorentz Symmetry**: This is the symmetry of special relativity, meaning the laws are the same for all observers in inertial frames. In the Standard Model, all interactions respect Lorentz symmetry. So, any operator in SMEFT must also respect this because the SM does. I think operators in SMEFT are constructed respecting Lorentz symmetry. So option 1 is correct.

2. **Poincare Symmetry**: Poincare includes Lorentz symmetry plus translations (like shifting space and time). The SM respects Poincare, so any effective operator should also respect this. Wait, but does that mean all operators in SMEFT must? Or is it more that the SM's operators do, but perhaps the effective theory could have terms that break it? Hmm, I'm a bit confused here. Wait, no, the effective theory is built to match the SM below a certain scale, so I think all terms must respect Poincare. So option 2 should also be correct. But wait, I think Poincare symmetry is actually a larger symmetry that includes Lorentz, but maybe not all SMEFT operators need to respect Poincare? No, wait, SMEFT is meant to be a valid effective theory, so it should respect the same symmetries as the SM, which includes Poincare. So, I'd say both Lorentz and Poincare are required. But wait, the question is about which must be respected by all operators. Do all SMEFT operators respect Poincare symmetry?

Wait, wait. Wait a second. The Standard Model itself respects Poincare symmetry, so the effective theory built on top of it must also respect it. So any operator in SMEFT must respect Poincare. So options 1 and 2 are both correct.

3. **CP symmetry**: CP stands for Charge conjugation and Parity. The SM doesn't respect CP symmetry. For example, the CKM matrix in QCD leads to CP violation. So, the SM itself violates CP, so SMEFT operators can violate CP as well. So the operators don't need to respect CP. So option 3 (CP) is not a must-respect symmetry. So, any operators that contribute to CP violation in the SM are already present, and SMEFT can include more CP-violating terms.

4. **CPT symmetry**: CPT is Charge-Parity-Time reversal. The SM respects CPT symmetry, right? Because all interactions are CPT-invariant. So, any operator in SMEFT must also respect CPT symmetry. Because if the effective theory didn't respect CPT, that would imply new physics beyond what's expected, and perhaps even violate some fundamental principles. So, I think all SMEFT operators must respect CPT symmetry. So option 4 is correct.

Wait, but I'm a bit fuzzy on whether CPT is automatically respected in any theory. I recall that in any Lorentz-invariant theory, CPT is a symmetry. Because in special relativity, the product of C, P, and T transformations leaves the theory invariant. So if a theory respects Lorentz symmetry, then it automatically respects CPT. Because the combination of CPT is a symmetry that comes from Lorentz symmetry. So, if all operators in SMEFT respect Lorentz symmetry (which they do, as per earlier), then they automatically respect CPT. So, do the operators need to explicitly respect CPT, or is it a consequence of respecting Lorentz?

Hmm, the question is asking which symmetries must be respected by all operators. So, if an operator respects Lorentz, then it's automatically respecting CPT because of the way the symmetry groups work. So, perhaps the question is about which symmetries are explicitly imposed, not necessarily which are automatically satisfied.

Wait, but the point is, operators must respect certain symmetries. So if the theory respects Lorentz, then CPT is automatically respected. So, perhaps the SMEFT operators don't need to separately respect CPT because it's already enforced by Lorentz symmetry. So, whether CPT is a required symmetry or not.

Alternatively, perhaps in the SMEFT, the CPT symmetry is not necessarily imposed because you can have terms that violate it if they're allowed by other symmetries. But wait, no, because if a theory includes terms that violate CPT, that would imply that the effective theory breaks CPT, but any Lorentz-invariant theory must respect CPT. Because in a Lorentz-invariant theory, the CPT symmetry arises from Lorentz transformations. For example, under a Lorentz boost, you might have to include a CPT transformation to maintain the form of the equations. So, any operator that's Lorentz-invariant is automatically CPT-invariant. Therefore, respecting Lorentz symmetry implies respecting CPT symmetry.

If that's the case, then the CPT symmetry doesn't have to be explicitly imposed because it's a consequence of Lorentz. So, the question is, do the SMEFT operators have to respect CPT, or is it automatically satisfied because they respect Lorentz?

So, the question is phrased as "must be respected by all operators." So, if operators respect Lorentz symmetry (which they do), then CPT is automatically respected. So, do the operators need to separately respect CPT? Or is CPT respect a consequence of Lorentz?

In that case, CPT symmetry is not an independent symmetry that must be enforced; it's a consequence of Lorentz. So, perhaps the answer doesn't include CPT as a separate requirement. Wait, but I'm a bit confused because some sources say that CPT is a symmetry of the Standard Model, so the SMEFT must respect it. But if it's a consequence of Lorentz, then perhaps it's automatically respected.

Wait, perhaps the answer is that operators must respect Lorentz, Poincare, and CPT symmetry. Or maybe not. Let me think again.

In the SMEFT, the operators are constructed in such a way that they respect the symmetries of the Standard Model. The Standard Model respects Lorentz, Poincare, and CPT, but not CP. So, the SMEFT operators must respect Lorentz and Poincare, but not necessarily CP. But what about CPT?

Since the SM respects CPT, then the effective theory must also respect it because any operator that's part of SMEFT must not break the SM's symmetries, except for those that are already violated in the SM, like CP. So, for example, the SM includes terms that violate CP, but the other symmetries (like CPT) are maintained.

So, in SMEFT, operators can violate CP, but they cannot violate CPT because the SM requires CPT to be preserved. Therefore, the operators must respect CPT.

Wait, but if an operator violates CPT, then it would imply that the theory isn't Lorentz-invariant, because CPT is a consequence of Lorentz invariance. So, if an operator violates CPT, it would break Lorentz symmetry. Therefore, the SMEFT operators cannot violate CPT because they respect Lorentz symmetry.

So, putting it all together: SMEFT operators must respect Lorentz symmetry (1) and Poincare symmetry (2). Wait, but Poincare includes Lorentz and translations. So, if operators respect Poincare, they automatically respect Lorentz. But in the options, 1 and 2 are separate. So, perhaps the correct statement is that operators must respect Poincare (which includes Lorentz), but the options don't have that. Wait, the options include 1,2, etc. So, the question is, which of the given symmetries must be respected.

Wait, but the SM respects both Lorentz and Poincare. So, SMEFT operators must respect both. Or is Poincare a larger symmetry which includes Lorentz, so if you respect Poincare, you automatically respect Lorentz.

But the question is phrased as, which of the following symmetries must be respected. So, perhaps all operators must respect both Lorentz and Poincare. So, options 1 and 2.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think about the structure of the theory. The SM is a Poincare-invariant theory, so the effective theory must also be Poincare-invariant. Because it's built to match the SM below a certain scale. So, any operator added must respect the same symmetries as the SM. Therefore, any operator in SMEFT must be Poincare-invariant. So, both Lorentz and Poincare are needed.

Wait, but Poincare includes translations, so perhaps the operators must respect both. So, in that case, both 1 and 2 are correct. But the question is whether all operators must respect both, or perhaps only Poincare is needed.

Alternatively, perhaps Poincare is the broader symmetry, so if you respect Poincare, you automatically respect Lorentz. So, the SMEFT operators must respect Poincare, which includes Lorentz.

Wait, but the options are 1,2,3,4. Let me look at the options again. The question is, which symmetries must be respected by all operators. So, for example, if an operator violates Lorentz, it would violate Poincare as well. So, if operators must respect Poincare, then they automatically respect Lorentz. So, perhaps the correct answer includes both 1 and 2, but I'm not entirely sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is that all operators must respect Lorentz symmetry because that's a separate requirement from Poincare. But I'm getting a bit confused.

Wait, let me think of an example. A term in the SMEFT Lagrangian is a Lorentz scalar. So, it's automatically a Poincare scalar as well because scalars are invariant under translations and Lorentz transformations. So, perhaps the requirement is that operators must be invariant under Lorentz, which in turn ensures that they are invariant under Poincare. Therefore, perhaps the only required symmetry to state is Lorentz, because Poincare is automatically respected.

But I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps both must be considered as separate symmetries that the operators must respect.

Wait, in textbooks, when building effective theories, you require that the operators are invariant under the SM gauge group and also under Lorentz symmetry. So, perhaps that's the main focus. Poincare includes translations, but in the context of effective field theories, the operators are typically built as local operators, so they would respect Poincare as a side effect.

Wait, but the SMEFT is a Lorentz-invariant theory, so all operators in it must respect Lorentz symmetry. As for Poincare, since they're part of the same framework, they automatically respect it. But I'm not entirely certain.

Now, looking at the options, the possible answers are:

A) 1,2: Lorentz and Poincare.

C) 1,2,4: Lorentz, Poincare, CPT.

D) 1,3,4: Lorentz, CP, CPT.

Hmm, so earlier I thought that operators must respect Lorentz (1), Poincare (2), and CPT (4), but not CP (3). But wait, earlier I thought that CPT is automatically respected because it's a consequence of Lorentz. So, perhaps the operators must respect Lorentz (1), which implies CPT (4). But the question is which symmetries must be 'respected' by the operators. So, perhaps the answer is that all operators must respect Lorentz, Poincare, and CPT. But I'm not sure because CPT is a consequence of Lorentz. So, perhaps only Lorentz is needed, and the others are automatically respected.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is that all operators must respect Lorentz, Poincare, and CPT, but not CP.

Wait, but the question is about which symmetries must be respected. The SMEFT operators must be Poincare-invariant because the SM is. So, yes, they must respect Poincare. So, 1 and 2 are correct. Also, because they respect Lorentz (1), they automatically respect CPT (4). So, 4 is automatically correct. So, the correct symmetries are 1,2,4. So, option C is 1,2,4.

Wait, option C is 1,2,4. So, that would mean Lorentz, Poincare, CPT.

But earlier I thought that option 4 (CPT) is automatically respected because of option 1. So, the question is, do the operators have to explicitly respect CPT, or is it a given?

Alternatively, perhaps the answer is that all operators must respect Lorentz, Poincare, and CPT, but not necessarily CP.

Wait, but the question is which of the four must be respected. So, the correct choice would be all the ones that are required. So, the options are:

A) 1 and 2.

C) 1,2,4.

So, which is correct.

Wait, I think I'm getting confused. Let me think about what each symmetry implies.

Poincare symmetry requires that the theory is invariant under translations (so the vacuum is non-unique, no preferred point in space or time) and Lorentz transformations. So, if a theory respects Poincare, it automatically respects Lorentz.

But in the SMEFT, I think the operators are constructed to be Poincare-invariant. So, the operators must respect Poincare symmetry, which includes Lorentz and translation invariance. So, the SMEFT is a Poincare-invariant effective theory.

So, the operators must respect Poincare (option 2) and Lorentz (option 1), but since Poincare includes Lorentz, perhaps both are required. But the question is, which of the options (1-4) must be respected. So, if Poincare is a required symmetry, and Lorentz is a subset, then both are required.

But wait, perhaps the correct way is to realize that Poincare is more fundamental. So, SMEFT operators must respect Poincare, which implies they respect Lorentz and translation. So, perhaps the correct answer is that both 1 and 2 are required. But in the options, the only one that includes both 1 and 2 is option A, which includes 1 and 2. But I thought that option C includes 1,2,4.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering Lorentz and CPT as separate symmetries, but I'm getting a bit stuck.

Wait, another approach: The Standard Model is invariant under CPT. So, any effective theory extending the SM must also be CPT-invariant, right? Because the SM is.

Wait, but SMEFT is an effective theory, not a fundamental one. So, the operators must respect the same symmetries as the SM, except for the ones that are already broken. So, the SM is not CP-invariant, so SMEFT allows for CP violation. But the SM is CPT-invariant, so SMEFT must respect CPT symmetry.

So, in that case, the SMEFT operators must respect Lorentz (1), Poincare (2), and CPT (4), but not necessarily CP (3).

So, the correct answer would be 1,2,4, which is option C.

But wait, earlier I thought that CPT is a consequence of Lorentz, so if the operators respect Lorentz, they automatically respect CPT. So, the answer would be 1,2,4? Or perhaps 1,2, and 4 are all required, but 4 is automatically satisfied because of 1.

But the question is, which symmetries must the operators respect. So, even if CPT is a consequence, the operators must respect it. So, perhaps 4 is a required symmetry.

So, I think the correct answer is option C: 1,2,4.


The Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT) is constructed to respect the symmetries of the Standard Model (SM) while incorporating higher-dimensional operators suppressed by a high-energy scale. These operators must adhere to the symmetries of the SM, as SMEFT is an effective framework built upon it. Let us analyze the given symmetries:

1. **Lorentz Symmetry**: This is a fundamental symmetry of the SM and must be respected by all SMEFT operators. Operators in SMEFT are constructed as Lorentz scalars to ensure compatibility with special relativity.

2. **Poincaré Symmetry**: Poincaré symmetry includes Lorentz symmetry and translation invariance. Since the SM respects Poincaré symmetry, SMEFT operators must also respect it. This symmetry ensures that the theory is valid in all inertial frames and is automatically satisfied if Lorentz symmetry is respected, as translation invariance is inherent in the effective field theory framework.

3. **CP Symmetry**: The SM explicitly violates CP symmetry (e.g., through the CKM matrix in QCD). Therefore, SMEFT operators are allowed to violate CP symmetry, and there is no requirement for them to respect it.

4. **CPT Symmetry**: The SM respects CPT symmetry, and any effective theory extending the SM must also respect it. CPT symmetry is a consequence of Lorentz symmetry in relativistic quantum field theories. Since SMEFT operators respect Lorentz symmetry, they automatically respect CPT symmetry.

From this analysis, all SMEFT operators must respect Lorentz symmetry (1), Poincaré symmetry (2), and CPT symmetry (4). CP symmetry (3) is not required, as it is already violated in the SM.

Thus, the correct answer is **C) 1, 2, 4**.

Answer: C
