Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm trying to wrap my head around it. Let's see what it's all about. So, the question is about a star with some specific characteristics and how spots on its surface affect the ratio of neutral Titanium (Ti) atoms in two energy levels. Hmm, that sounds a bit complicated, but let's break it down step by step.

Alright, the star has a radius of 1.5 solar radii and a mass of 1.1 solar masses. When there are no spots, its effective temperature (Teff) is 6000 K. But when 40% of its surface is covered by spots, the overall Teff drops to 5500 K. Oh wait, but waitâ€”what do these spots do exactly? I remember that starspots are cooler regions on the star's surface, so when they cover a part of the star, that part is darker and cooler than the surrounding photosphere. So the overall effective temperature of the star decreases because a portion of its surface is emitting less light.

Now, the main part of the question is about the ratio of the number of neutral Ti atoms in two energy levels. Without spots, the ratio is a certain value, and when spots are present, it changes. The problem states that this ratio decreases when the star has spots. We need to find the factor by which this ratio changes when the star doesn't have spots compared to when it does.

Wait, the ratio is level 1 to level 2, right? So when there are spots, this ratio goes down. So the factor is (ratio without spots) / (ratio with spots) = how much?

I remember that the ratio of populations of two energy levels in a star's atmosphere is given by the Boltzmann equation. The ratio (N2/N1) is equal to (g2/g1) * exp( -(E2-E1)/(k T) ), where g is the statistical weight (or degeneracy), E is the energy, k is Boltzmann's constant, and T is the temperature.

But wait, the question is about the ratio of N1/N2 or N2/N1? Let me check. The ratio is level 1 to level 2. So if it's N1/N2, that would be higher when the temperature is lower because the exponent becomes more negative, so the exponential term would decrease. So if the overall temperature of the photosphere drops, the ratio N1/N2 increases? Or does it have to do with each region's temperature?

Wait, but the star's photosphere is in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE), so each small region is at its own temperature. But when spots are present, different parts of the photosphere are at different temperatures. How does this affect the overall ratio?

Wait, when the star has spots, 60% of its surface is at Teff = 6000 K (the normal temperature), and 40% is at a lower temperature (the spots). But what is the temperature of the spots? Hmm, the problem states that when 40% is covered, the overall Teff is 5500 K. But I'm not sure if the spots' temperature is much lower or just a little lower. Wait, I think I need to find the effective temperature of
