Okay, so I've got this question about symmetries in the Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT). I'm a bit rusty on my particle physics, but I'll try to think it through.

The question is asking which symmetries must be respected by all operators in SMEFT. The options are Lorentz Symmetry (1), Poincare symmetry (2), CP symmetry (3), and CPT symmetry (4). The choices are combinations of these.

Hmm, first, I need to remember what each of these symmetries means and how they apply in the SMEFT framework.

Starting with Lorentz Symmetry (1). I know that Lorentz symmetry refers to the invariance under Lorentz transformations, which include rotations and boosts. Since SMEFT is an effective field theory, it's constructed in a way that respects the symmetries of the Standard Model. The Standard Model, and hence SMEFT, should preserve Lorentz symmetry. So all operators in SMEFT must respect Lorentz symmetry. So 1 is definitely a correct point.

Next, Poincare symmetry (2). Poincare symmetry includes Lorentz symmetry plus translations (like shifting space and time). Wait, but in general, effective field theories are built in a way that's Lorentz invariant but not necessarily respecting global symmetries like translations because the theory is typically considered non-renormalizable and works up to some cutoff scale. Or does SMEFT respect Poincare? I think SMEFT is a Lorentz-invariant theory, but Poincare includes both Lorentz and translations. But wait, in SMEFT, the operators are classified by their Lorentz structure, implying Lorentz symmetry holds. However, do all operators respect Poincare? Well, I'm a bit confused. Because in general, a theory can have Lorentz symmetry without Poincare if, say, it's not invariant under translations, but I think SMEFT is a Lorentz-invariant theory, and since Poincare includes Lorentz, but SMEFT might not necessarily require translation invariance? Or wait, maybe I'm mixing things up. SMEFT is a field theory, so it's built on a spacetime with Poincare symmetry. So all its operators must respect Poincare? Or is it that Poincare isn't a separate symmetry here because it's encompassed by the fact that it's a relativistic theory. Hmm. Wait, Poincare symmetry includes both Lorentz and translations. But in an effective field theory, the operators have definite Lorentz indices, so they must transform correctly under Lorentz
