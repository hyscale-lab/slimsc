Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds, and I need to find the relative speed and the total energy of the system. Hmm, let's break this down.

First, the problem says there are two astronauts. Their masses are 2m and 3m. They're moving in the positive x-direction at 0.6c and 0.5c respectively. So, astronaut A is 2m at 0.6c, astronaut B is 3m at 0.5c.

Wait, the question is about the relative speed between them and the total energy of the system. Right, so I think I need to calculate two things: the relative velocity (v_rel) and the total energy (E) of both astronauts combined.

Let me tackle the relative speed first. Oh wait, relative velocity in relativity isn't just subtracting speeds like in Newtonian mechanics. I remember the formula for adding velocities in relativity is different. The formula is v_rel = (v1 - v2)/(1 - (v1*v2)/(c²)). But wait, wait, wait. Let me think again. When you have two objects moving in the same direction, the relative speed of one with respect to the other is (v1 - v2)/(1 - (v1 v2)/c²). Yes, that's right.

So here, astronaut A is moving at 0.6c, astronaut B at 0.5c, both in the same direction. So from A's perspective, what's the speed of B? Or is it the other way around? Wait, the question says 'relative speed', which is a scalar, so it's just the magnitude. But I need to be careful about the direction.

Wait, no, relative speed could be considered as the speed of one as seen from the other. So if A is moving faster, then from A's frame, B would be moving at (0.6 - 0.5) / (1 - (0.6*0.5)) but wait, wait—the formula is (v_A - v_B)/(1 - (v_A*v_B)/(c²)). So v_A is 0.6c, v_B is 0.5c. So v_rel would be (0.6c -0.5c) / [1 - (0.6c * 0.5c)/(c²)].

Let me compute that. The numerator is 0.1c. The denominator's denominator is 0.3c² divided by c², so 0.3. So denominator is 1 - 0.3 = 0.7. So v_rel = (0.1c) / 0.7 ≈ 0.1428c, so approximately 0.14c. Oh, that's one of the options. Looking at the options, option C and D have 0.14c for v_rel. So that's a clue.

Now for the total energy. Each astronaut's energy is their relativistic energy, which is gamma times m c squared. So the total energy would be the sum of both energies.

Gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²). So for astronaut A, v is 0.6c. So gamma_A = 1/sqrt(1 - (0.6)^2) = 1/sqrt(1 - 0.36) = 1/sqrt(0.64) = 1/0.8 = 1.25.

So energy of A is gamma_A * m_A c^2 = 1.25 * 2m * c^2 = 2.5 m c².

For astronaut B, v is 0.5c. Gamma_B = 1/sqrt(1 - 0.25) = 1/sqrt(0.75) ≈ 1.1547.

So energy of B is gamma_B * m_B c^2 = 1.1547 * 3m c² ≈ 3.464 m c².

So total energy E = 2.5 + 3.464 ≈ 5.964 m c². So approximately 5.96 m c².

Looking back at the options, option C has v_rel = 0.14c and E=5.96 mc². That's matching. Option B has E=4.96, which is lower. So C is the correct choice.

Wait, but let me double-check the calculation. Maybe I made a mistake with the gammas.

Gamma for A: 0.6c, so (0.6)^2 is 0.36. 1-0.36 is 0.64. Square root is 0.8. Gamma is 1/0.8=1.25. So that's correct. So 2m * 1.25 = 2.5 mc².

Gamma for B: 0.5c, (0.5)^2=0.25. 1-0.25=0.75. Square root is sqrt(3)/2 ≈0.866. So gamma is 1/0.866 ≈1.1547. So 3m *1.1547 ≈3.464 m. So 2.5 + 3.464 =5.964, which is approximately 5.96 mc². So yes, option C.

So the options are:

A) v_rel=1.1c, which is impossible because nothing goes faster than c. So can't be A.

B) v_rel=0.1c, E=4.96. Hmm, but our calculation was 0.14c and 5.96. So B doesn't match.

C) v_rel=0.14c, E=5.96. Yes.

D) v_rel=0.14c, E=5mc². Oh, 5 is lower than our calculated 5.96, so D is incorrect.

Hence, the correct answer is option C.


To solve the problem, we calculate the relative speed and the total energy of the system for two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds.

### Step 1: Relative Speed
The relative speed between two objects moving in the same direction in special relativity is given by:

\[
v_{\text{rel}} = \frac{v_1 - v_2}{1 - \frac{v_1 v_2}{c^2}}
\]

Here, \(v_1 = 0.6c\) and \(v_2 = 0.5c\). Substituting these values:

\[
v_{\text{rel}} = \frac{0.6c - 0.5c}{1 - \frac{(0.6c)(0.5c)}{c^2}} = \frac{0.1c}{1 - 0.3} = \frac{0.1c}{0.7} \approx 0.14c
\]

Thus, the relative speed is approximately \(0.14c\).

### Step 2: Total Energy
The total energy of each astronaut is given by the relativistic energy formula:

\[
E = \gamma m c^2, \quad \text{where } \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}}}
\]

#### For astronaut A (\(m = 2m\), \(v = 0.6c\)):
\[
\gamma_A = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - (0.6)^2}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - 0.36}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.64}} = \frac{1}{0.8} = 1.25
\]
\[
E_A = \gamma_A (2m) c^2 = 1.25 \cdot 2m c^2 = 2.5m c^2
\]

#### For astronaut B (\(m = 3m\), \(v = 0.5c\)):
\[
\gamma_B = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - (0.5)^2}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - 0.25}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.75}} \approx 1.1547
\]
\[
E_B = \gamma_B (3m) c^2 = 1.1547 \cdot 3m c^2 \approx 3.464m c^2
\]

#### Total Energy:
\[
E_{\text{total}} = E_A + E_B = 2.5m c^2 + 3.464m c^2 \approx 5.96m c^2
\]

### Step 3: Matching with Options
- **Option A:** \(v_{\text{rel}} = 1.1c\) (impossible, as nothing can exceed \(c\)).
- **Option B:** \(v_{\text{rel}} = 0.1c\), \(E = 4.96m c^2\) (does not match calculations).
- **Option C:** \(v_{\text{rel}} = 0.14c\), \(E = 5.96m c^2\) (matches both relative speed and total energy).
- **Option D:** \(v_{\text{rel}} = 0.14c\), \(E = 5m c^2\) (does not match total energy).

Thus, the correct answer is **Option C**.
