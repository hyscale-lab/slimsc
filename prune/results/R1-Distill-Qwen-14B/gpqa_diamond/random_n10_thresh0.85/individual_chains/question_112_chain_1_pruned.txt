Okay, so I'm trying to solve this quantum mechanics problem. Let me read it again carefully. The question is about an electron in a state |alpha>, which is proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2 -i)|down>. The |up> and |down> are eigenstates of the z-projection of the spin operator. I need to find the probabilities of measuring the particle in each eigenstate of another operator, whose matrix elements are given by A_ij = ħ/2 if i≠j and 0 otherwise. Also, I have to find the average value of that operator.

Hmm. Let me break this down step by step.

First, I think I need to normalize the state |alpha>. Because it's proportional, but we need the exact state for probabilities. The expression is (1+i)|up> + (2 -i)|down>. So the state can be written as a vector in the spin space, which for spin-1/2 particles is two-dimensional. Let me denote |up> as (1, 0) and |down> as (0, 1). So the state vector would be [1+i, 2-i]^T.

To normalize, I'll compute the inner product of the state with itself. The inner product is (1+i)(1-i) + (2-i)(2+i). Let's calculate each part.

(1+i)(1-i) = 1 - i^2 = 1 - (-1) = 2.

(2 -i)(2 +i) = 4 + 2i -2i -i^2 = 4 - (-1) =5.

Adding these together gives 2 +5 =7. So the norm is sqrt(7), so the normalized state is (1+i)/sqrt(7) |up> + (2 -i)/sqrt(7) |down>.

Now, the next part is about an operator with matrix elements A_ij = ħ/2 when i≠j, and 0 otherwise. Wait, what does that matrix look like? For a 2x2 matrix, the diagonal elements are zero, and the off-diagonal are ħ/2.

So A matrix is [[0, ħ/2], [ħ/2, 0]]. That looks familiar. Oh, that's the Pauli X matrix multiplied by ħ/2. Wait, the Pauli X matrix is [[0,1],[1,0]], so A is (ħ/2) * X.

So the eigenstates of A are the same as the eigenstates of X. The eigenstates of X are |+x> and |-x>, which are (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2) and (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2), respectively. 

Wait, but in this problem, we're asked about the eigenstates of the operator A. So first, we need to express |alpha> in terms of the eigenbasis of A. The probability of measuring each eigenstate is the square of the amplitude.

Alternatively, since A is a Hermitian operator, the states can be expanded in the eigenbasis of A. Let me proceed step by step.

First, find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of A. The matrix A is [[0, ħ/2], [ħ/2, 0]]. The eigenvalues of this matrix can be found by solving det(A - λ I)=0.

The characteristic equation is:

| -λ    ħ/2   |
| ħ/2  -λ     |  = 0

So (-λ)(-λ) - (ħ/2)(ħ/2) = λ² - (ħ²/4) = 0. Therefore, λ² = ħ²/4 → λ= ± ħ/2.

So the eigenvalues are ħ/2 and -ħ/2. The corresponding eigenvectors can be found. For λ= ħ/2, solving (A - (ħ/2)I) v =0.

The matrix becomes [[-ħ/2, ħ/2], [ħ/2, -ħ/2]].

Taking the first equation: (-ħ/2) v1 + (ħ/2) v2 =0 → v1 = v2.

So the eigenvector is proportional to (1,1). Similarly, for λ= -ħ/2, the equations give v1 = -v2, so eigenvector (1,-1).

But wait, to make them orthonormal, they should be normalized. So the eigenstates are |+A> = (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2) and |−A> = (|up> − |down>)/sqrt(2).

Wait, no. Wait, A has eigenvalues ± ħ/2. So the eigenstates are (1,1)/sqrt(2) and (1,-1)/sqrt(2), but scaled by the eigenvalues. Hmm, but since the eigenvalues are already accounted for, the eigenvectors are as said.

So now, the state |alpha> is expressed in the original basis (|up>, |down>), but we need to express it in terms of |+A> and |−A> to find the probabilities.

Let me write |alpha> as a linear combination of |+A> and |−A>. Let me denote |alpha> = c_+ |+A> + c_- |−A>.

So, let's compute c_+ and c_-. |+A> is (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2), and |−A> is (|up> − |down>)/sqrt(2).

Given that |alpha> is (1+i)|up> + (2 -i)|down>, divided by sqrt(7).

So, let's compute the coefficients c_+ and c_-. The inner product of |alpha> with each eigenstate.

c_+ = < +A | alpha >

= [ (1, 1)/sqrt(2) ]^dagger [ (1+i, 2 -i)/sqrt(7) ]

= [ (1)(1+i) + (1)(2 -i) ] / (sqrt(2)*sqrt(7)) )

= [ 1+i +2 -i ] / sqrt(14)

Simplify numerator: 3. So c_+ = 3 / sqrt(14).

Similarly, c_- = < −A | alpha >.

= [ (1, -1)/sqrt(2) ]^dagger [ (1+i, 2 -i)/sqrt(7) ]

= [ (1)(1+i) + (-1)(2 -i) ] / sqrt(14)

Compute numerator: 1+i -2 +i = (1-2) + (i +i) = (-1) + 2i.

So c_- = (-1 + 2i)/sqrt(14).

Wait, let me check that calculation again.

Wait, the components of |alpha> are (1+i)/sqrt(7) for |up> and (2 -i)/sqrt(7) for |down>.

So when taking the inner product with |+A>, which is (1,1)/sqrt(2):

= [ (1+i)/sqrt(7) * 1/sqrt(2) ] + [ (2 -i)/sqrt(7) * 1/sqrt(2) ]

= [ (1+i) + (2 -i) ] / (sqrt(7) * sqrt(2)) )

= [3 ] / sqrt(14)

Yes, that's correct.

Similarly for c_-:

= [ (1+i)/sqrt(7) * 1/sqrt(2) ] + [ (2 -i)/sqrt(7) * (-1)/sqrt(2) ]

= [ (1+i) - (2 -i) ] / sqrt(14)

= [ (1-2) + (i +i) ] / sqrt(14) → (-1 +2i)/sqrt(14).

Wait, but let me compute that again:
