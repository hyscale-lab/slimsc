Okay, so I’ve got this astronomy question here about exoplanets and the radial velocity method. Hmm, let me try to think through this step by step.

Alright, the question says that two stars with the same mass as the Sun have each been found to have a planet with masses similar to Neptune. Both planets are in circular orbits. The method used is the radial velocity (RV) method. 

The RV method measures the Doppler shift in the star's spectral lines caused by the planet's gravitational pull. The shift tells us about the star's motion towards or away from us, which helps determine the planet's orbit.

The problem gives the shift in the spectral lines for each planet. Planet #1 has a shift of 5 milliangstroms, and Planet #2 has a shift of 7 milliangstroms. The question is asking how many times longer the orbital period of Planet #2 is compared to Planet #1.

Wait, how does the Doppler shift relate to the orbital period? I remember that the RV method measures the semi-amplitude of the star's velocity. The formula for the semi-amplitude (K) is related to the mass of the planet, the star's mass, the orbital period, and the distance of the planet from the star.

The formula I think is K = (v) = (2π G)^(1/3) * (M_p sin i) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(2/3) * (P)^(1/3) ) ) 

But since M_p is much smaller than M_star (Neptune is way less massive than the Sun), we can approximate M_star + M_p ≈ M_star. So the formula simplifies a bit.

So K is proportional to (M_p) / (M_star^(2/3) * P^(1/3) )

Wait, but in this problem, the masses of the stars are the same, and the planet masses are similar to Neptune, so M_p is the same for both planets. So M_p and M_star are the same for both, meaning K is inversely proportional to P^(1/3).

So K ∝ 1 / P^(1/3)

So if K1 is the semi-amplitude for planet #1 and K2 for #2, then K1/K2 = (P2/P1)^(1/3) )

Wait, no. Let me think again. Because K is proportional to (1 / P^(1/3)), so K1 = C / P1^(1/3), K2 = C / P2^(1/3), where C is a constant for the same M_p and M_star.

So K1/K2 = [1/P1^(1/3)] / [1/P2^(1/3)] = (P2/P1)^(1/3)

But wait, in the question, K1 is 5 milliangstroms, K2 is 7. So K1 < K2.

So K1/K2 = 5/7. Let's compute that:

5/7 ≈ 0.714.

So 0.714 = (P2/P1)^(1/3)

To find P2/P1, cube both sides.

(0.714)^3 ≈ ?

Let me calculate that. 0.7^3 is 0.343. 0.714 is a bit more than 0.7, so maybe around 0.36 or so? Wait, 7^3 is 343, 5^3 is 125. 5/7 is 0.714, so (5/7)^3 is 125/343 ≈ 0.364.

So (P2/P1) = (5/7)^3 ≈ 0.364. Wait, wait, no. Because earlier I had K1/K2 = (P2/P1)^(1/3). Let me re-derive:

We have K ∝ 1/P^(1/3) → K = C / P^(1/3), where C is a constant.

So K1 = C1 / P1^(1/3), K2 = C2 / P2^(1/3). But since M_p and M_star are same, C1 = C2, so C1 = C2 = C.

Thus, K1 = C / P1^(1/3), K2 = C / P2^(1/3).

So K1/K2 = [C / P1^(1/3)] / [C / P2^(1/3)] = (P2/P1)^(1/3).

So (K1/K2) = (P2/P1)^(1/3).

We have K1=5, K2=7. So K1/K2 = 5/7 ≈ 0.714.

So 0.714 = (P2/P1)^(1/3).

Cubing both sides: (0.714)^3 ≈ (5/7)^3 = 125/343 ≈ 0.364.

So P2/P1 ≈ 0.364 → P2 is about 0.364 times P1, meaning P2 is shorter than P1. So the period of planet #2 is about 0.36 times that of planet #1. So the orbital period of planet #2 is shorter, meaning planet #1's period is longer.

Wait, but the question is asking how many times longer is the orbital period of planet #2 than planet #1. So that would be P2 / P1 = 0.364, which is less than 1. So planet #2’s period is about 0.36 times that of planet #1. So planet #2's orbital period is shorter, not longer. So the ratio is about 0.36.

Looking at the options, option A is ~0.36.

Wait, but wait a second. Did I get the ratio P2/P1? Because if P2 is 0.36 times P1, then P2 is shorter. So the question is, how many times longer is P2 than P1. So it's P2 / P1. If P2 is 0.36 of P1, then P2 is 0.36 times P1, so the period is shorter. So the question is, how many times longer is P2 than P1? That would be 0.36 times as long. So the answer would be ~0.36, which is option A.

Hmm, but let me think again. Let me step back.

The RV method's semi-amplitude K is given by the formula:

K = [ (G * (M_p)^3 sin i) / ( (M_star + M_p)^2 ) ) ]^(1/3) * (1 / (2π G)) * (1 / (P * (1 - e²)^(3/2))) ) )

Wait, perhaps I should just look up the exact formula. Oh wait, I'm supposed to think through this.

Alternatively, the RV semi-amplitude K is given by:

K = (v) = [ (G * (M_p sin i) ) / ( (M_star) * (1 - e^2)^(3/2) ) ) ]^(1/3) * (2π / P )^(1/3) )

Wait, perhaps that's getting too complicated. Maybe I should use the simplified version where for circular orbits (e=0), and M_p << M_star, so M_star + M_p ≈ M_star.

In that case, K = ( (2π G )^(1/3) * (M_p sin i) ) / ( (M_star)^(2/3) (P)^(1/3) ) ) )

So K is proportional to M_p / ( (M_star)^(2/3) (P)^(1/3) ) )

Since M_p and M_star are the same for both planets, K is inversely proportional to P^(1/3).

So K1 = C / P1^(1/3)

K2 = C / P2^(1/3)

Taking the ratio K1/K2 = (P2 / P1)^(1/3)

So (K1/K2) = (P2/P1)^(1/3)

We have K1 =5, K2=7 → 5/7 = (P2/P1)^(1/3)

So (P2/P1) = (5/7)^3 = 125/343 ≈ 0.364 → So P2 is about 0.364 times P1.

So the question is, how many times longer is P2 than P1? So it's P2 / P1 ≈ 0.364, which is about 0.36 times. So option A is ~0.36.

Wait, but wait another thing. Am I making a mistake in the ratio? Because if K is inversely proportional to P^(1/3), then if K increases, P decreases.

So, Planet #1 has a smaller K (5) compared to Planet #2 (7). So higher K implies shorter period.

So Planet #2 has a larger K, so shorter period. So the period of Planet #2 is shorter than Planet #1. Hence, the ratio P2/P1 is less than 1.

But the question is asking how many times longer is P2 than P1. So that would be P2/P1, which is 0.36 times. So it's about 0.36 times as long, meaning P2 is shorter. So the correct answer is A, ~0.36.


To determine how many times longer the orbital period of Planet #2 is compared to Planet #1, we analyze the relationship between the radial velocity (RV) semi-amplitude \( K \) and the orbital period \( P \). The RV semi-amplitude is given by:

\[
K \propto \frac{M_p}{(M_{\text{star}})^{2/3} P^{1/3}}
\]

where \( M_p \) is the planet's mass, \( M_{\text{star}} \) is the star's mass, and \( P \) is the orbital period. Since the masses of the planets and stars are the same for both systems, \( K \) is inversely proportional to \( P^{1/3} \). This can be expressed as:

\[
K_1 \propto \frac{1}{P_1^{1/3}}, \quad K_2 \propto \frac{1}{P_2^{1/3}}
\]

Taking the ratio of the semi-amplitudes:

\[
\frac{K_1}{K_2} = \frac{P_2^{1/3}}{P_1^{1/3}}
\]

Cubing both sides:

\[
\left(\frac{K_1}{K_2}\right)^3 = \frac{P_2}{P_1}
\]

Given \( K_1 = 5 \, \text{milliangstroms} \) and \( K_2 = 7 \, \text{milliangstroms} \), we calculate:

\[
\frac{K_1}{K_2} = \frac{5}{7} \approx 0.714
\]

\[
\left(\frac{5}{7}\right)^3 = \frac{125}{343} \approx 0.364
\]

Thus:

\[
\frac{P_2}{P_1} \approx 0.364
\]

This means the orbital period of Planet #2 is approximately 0.36 times that of Planet #1. Therefore, Planet #2's orbital period is about 0.36 times as long as Planet #1's.
