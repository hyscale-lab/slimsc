Okay, so I have this physics problem about particle decays, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step.

The problem says that the mass of the boson X is 6 GeV. I need to find out which decay channels are kinematically allowed at the lowest order. The options are A, B, C, D, each listing different fermion pairs.

First, I remember that for a particle to decay into a pair of fermions, the mass of the boson must be at least twice the mass of each fermion in the pair. Because when a boson decays, the energy has to be enough to create the fermions.

So, the boson X has a mass of 6 GeV. I need to list all possible fermion pairs where each fermion's mass is less than or equal to 3 GeV (since 6 GeV divided by 2 is 3 GeV). Because each fermion in the pair must be at most half the mass of X.

Now, I think about the masses of the known fermions. Let me list them:

- Electron (e): very light, negligible, around 0.0005 GeV.
- Muon (μ): about 0.1 GeV.
- Tau (τ): around 1.78 GeV.
- Up quark (u): around 2.2 MeV, which is 0.0022 GeV.
- Down quark (d): about 4.7 MeV, ~0.0047 GeV.
- Strange quark (s): around 100 MeV, 0.1 GeV.
- Charm quark (c): approximately 1.5 GeV.
- Bottom quark (b): around 4.7 GeV.
- Top quark (t): way too heavy, around 173 GeV.

Wait, but wait. Because for decay into a quark-antiquark pair, the mass required is twice the mass of the quark. So for X to decay into, say, uū, each u is 0.0022 GeV, so the total is about 0.0044 GeV. That's way less than 6 GeV, so that decay is allowed.

Same for d d̄, s s̄. What about c c̄? Each c is about 1.5 GeV. So 2 * 1.5 = 3 GeV. Oh wait, but X's mass is 6 GeV. So 3 GeV is less than 6, so c c̄ is allowed.

But what about b b̄? Each b is about 4.7 GeV. So two of them would be 9.4 GeV. That's more than 6 GeV, so X can't decay into b b̄. Because 9.4 >6. So any option with b b̄ is incorrect.

Similarly, top quarks are way too heavy, so t t̄ is impossible.

So now, looking at the possible fermion pairs:

The leptons: e, μ, τ. Let's see their masses:

e+ e−: each is ~0.0005 GeV, so 2 * 0.0005 = 0.001 GeV. X can decay into that.

μ+ μ−: each muon is ~0.1 GeV. 2 * 0.1 = 0.2 GeV. X's 6 GeV is way more than enough.

τ+ τ−: each tau is ~1.78 GeV. So 2*1.78 = 3.56 GeV. X's mass is 6 GeV, so 3.56 <6, so allowed.

So leptonic decays allowed are e+, e−, μ+ μ−, τ+ τ−.

Now, quark pairs:

u ū: allowed, as 2m_u <<6 GeV.
d d̄: allowed, same reason.
s s̄: allowed, each s is 0.1 GeV, so 0.2 total.

c c̄: 2*1.5 =3 GeV. 3 <6, allowed.

b b̄: 9.4 GeV, which is more than 6, so not allowed.

t t̄: way too heavy, so not allowed.

What about other quarks like the bottom quark? No, as discussed, not possible.

So possible decay channels are:

uū, d d̄, s s̄, c c̄, e+ e−, μ+ μ−, τ+ τ−.

Wait, but looking at the options, let's check each option.

Option A: X→ b b̄
