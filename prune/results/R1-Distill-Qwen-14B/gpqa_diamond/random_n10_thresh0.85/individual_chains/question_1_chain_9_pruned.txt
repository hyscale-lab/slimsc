Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics question about energy levels and their lifetimes. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but let's think through this.

The question says we have two quantum states with energies E1 and E2. Their lifetimes are 10^-9 seconds and 10^-8 seconds respectively. We need to find the energy difference so that they can be clearly resolved.

Wait, I remember something about the energy-time uncertainty principle. Oh right, the Heisenberg uncertainty principle states that ΔE * Δt ≈ ħ/2, where ħ is the reduced Planck's constant. So the uncertainty in energy depends on the time the state exists.

The lifetime is the Δt here, right? So for each state, the uncertainty in energy would be ħ divided by the lifetime. But wait, I'm a bit confused about which lifetime to use. Oh, wait, each state has its own lifetime. So the energy uncertainty for each state would relate to their respective lifetimes.

Wait, but the question is about the energy difference between E1 and E2. So we probably need to consider the uncertainty in each and then see if the difference is larger than the sum of the uncertainties? Because if the energy difference is much larger than the uncertainties, they can be distinguished.

Let me get the formula straight. The uncertainty principle is ΔE * Δt ≈ ħ. So ΔE ≈ ħ / Δt.

So for E1, Δt1 is 1e-9 seconds. So ΔE1 = ħ / Δt1.

Similarly, for E2, Δt2 is 1e-8 seconds. So ΔE2 = ħ / Δt2.

Wait, but since E2 has a longer lifetime, its ΔE would be smaller. Because as lifetime increases, energy uncertainty decreases. Because if a state exists longer, we know its energy more precisely.

So let's compute the numerical values. Let's get ħ in eV·s units. I think ħ is approximately 6.582e-16 eV·s.

So for ΔE1:
ΔE1 = 6.582e-16 eV·s / (1e-9 s) = 6.582e-7 eV.

Similarly, ΔE2 = 6.582e-16 / 1e-8 = 6.582e-8 eV.

Wait, but wait. Wait, the lifetimes are given as the lifetimes of each state. So each state has its own ΔE uncertainty. But when we're looking at the energy difference between E1 and E2, the total uncertainty would probably be the sum of the individual uncertainties, right? Because each contributes their own uncertainty when measuring the difference.

Wait, maybe I'm mixing things up. Let me think. The energy difference ΔE = E2 - E1. The uncertainty in ΔE would be the uncertainty in E2 plus the uncertainty in E1. Because ΔE = (E2 ± ΔE2) - (E1 ± ΔE1), so the uncertainty in ΔE is ΔE2 + ΔE1.

So to clearly distinguish E1 and E2, the energy difference ΔE should be greater than the sum of their uncertainties.

So ΔE > ΔE1 + ΔE2.

Calculating that sum:

ΔE1 is ~6.582e-7 eV, ΔE2 is ~6.582e-8 eV. Adding them: 6.582e-7 + 6.582e-8 = 7.2
