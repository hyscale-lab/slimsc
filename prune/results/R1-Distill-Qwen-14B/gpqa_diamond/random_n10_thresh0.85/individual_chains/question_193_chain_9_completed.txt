Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm a bit confused, but let me try to work through it step by step. So the question is about how the number of stars changes with distance, given a specific relationship between the number of stars and parallax.

Hmm, the problem states that the number of stars varies with parallax as 1 over plx to the fifth power. Wait, so N ∝ 1/plx^5. Parallax is the apparent shift in the position of a star due to Earth's orbit, right? And I remember that parallax (plx) is inversely proportional to distance. So plx = 1/d, where d is distance. Oh wait, but wait, the exact formula is plx (in arcseconds) is equal to 1 parsec divided by distance in parsecs. So plx = 1/d, meaning as distance increases, parallax decreases.

So if N is proportional to 1/(plx)^5, and plx is proportional to 1/d, then substituting that in, N ∝ (d)^5. Because 1/( (1/d) )^5 is d^5. So N ∝ d^5. But wait, the question is asking how the number of stars changes with distance per unit range. So when you increase the distance by a small amount, how does the number of stars change?

Wait, maybe I should think in terms of differential. If N is proportional to d^5, then the change in N with distance dr would be dN/d(d) = 5d^4. So the number of stars per unit distance (or the density) would go like r^4, since d is the same as r here.

Wait, but wait a second. Let me make sure. So N is proportional to 1/(plx)^5. And since plx = 1/d, then N ∝ d^5. So N = k * d^5, where k is some constant. But the number of stars in a region as a function of distance would mean how many stars are present when you look at a shell of radius r. So the number in a shell at distance r with thickness dr is N(r) * 4πr² dr (because volume of a shell is 4πr² dr). But wait, wait, no, wait. No, wait. If the number of stars per unit volume is proportional to r^5, then the number in a volume element dV would be proportional to r^5 * dV. But wait, perhaps I'm getting confused between the number density and the total number in a region.

Wait, the problem states that the number of stars varies with parallax as 1/plx^5. So N ∝ 1/plx^5, which as I said is N ∝ d^5.

But if I'm looking at a thin shell at distance r, the number of stars in that shell would be N_shell ∝ d^5 * (volume of shell) ? No, wait, no. Wait, the number of stars in a volume is N = n * V, where n is number density. So if N is proportional to 1/plx^5, which is d^5, then n = N/V would be proportional to d^5 / V. Wait, but for a volume of a sphere, V = (4/3)πr³, so d is r. So n ∝ r^5 / r^3 = r^2. So the number density would be proportional to r^2. But that doesn't seem right because if N is the total number in a volume, then if you have a larger volume, more stars, but if number density is r^2, that would imply more stars per unit volume as r increases.

Wait, maybe I'm approaching this wrong. Let me think again. The question says that the number of stars varies with parallax as 1/plx^5. So for a given parallax, the number of stars is inversely proportional to plx^5. But wait, parallax is inversely proportional to distance. So plx = 1/d. So N ∝ 1/( (1/d) )^5 = d^5. So N is proportional to d^5.

But how does N change with distance? The question is about the change in the number of stars per unit distance. So for a small change in distance, how much does N change? That's the slope dN/dr.

So dN/dr = d/d(r) (k r^5 ) = 5k r^4. So the number of stars per unit distance is proportional to r^4.

Wait, but wait. The problem is about the number of stars in a region of the sky. So perhaps it's not about a volume, but about a surface density? Or is it about the number per unit volume?

Wait, perhaps I need to clarify the relationship. The problem states that in a specific region of the sky, the number of stars varies with parallax as 1/plx^5. So that implies that for a given region, as parallax decreases (distance increases), the number of stars increases as 1/(plx)^5.

Wait, but parallax is a measure of distance; lower parallax means farther away. So in a specific region, let's say a small patch of the sky, the number of stars at a certain distance is N ∝ 1/plx^5. So since plx = 1/d, N ∝ d^5.

But wait, when considering how the number of stars changes with distance, perhaps we're considering a thin shell at distance d. So the number of stars in that shell would be N_shell = (number density) * volume of the shell. The volume of the shell is 4πd² dr, where dr is the thickness of the shell. So N_shell = n * 4πd² dr. 

If the number density n is proportional to d^5, then N_shell ∝ d^5 * d^2 dr = d^7 dr. But that would make the number of stars per unit distance (dr) increase as d^7, which isn't one of the options. But wait, I'm getting confused. I think I might have made a mistake in the approach.

Wait, perhaps the number of stars is proportional to 1/plx^5, but that's for a unit volume. Because parallax is related to distance, and thus volume. So let's think in terms of number density, n = N/V. So n ∝ 1/plx^5.

But since plx = 1/d (parallax in arcseconds and distance in parsecs), then n ∝ d^5. So the number density n increases with the fifth power of distance. But the question is about the number of stars in a region as a function of distance. So for a thin shell at distance d with thickness dr, the number of stars would be n * 4πd² dr. Substituting n = k d^5, then the number of stars in the shell is 4πk d^5 d² dr =4πk d^7 dr. So the number of stars per unit distance (dr) increases as d^7. But that's not any of the options given. The options are up to r^5. Hmm, that can't be right.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let's go back. The problem says that in a specific region, the number of stars varies with parallax as 1/plx^5. So for a given region, N ∝ 1/plx^5. So N = k / (plx)^5. Since plx = 1/d, N = k d^5. So N increases with the fifth power of distance.

But the question is asking how the number of stars changes with distance, per unit range of distance. So dN/dr is the rate of change. So dN/dr = 5k d^4. So the number of stars per unit distance increases as r^4. So the answer would be option C, which is ~ r^4.

Wait, but the options are given as "number of stars in that region of the sky change with distance (per unit range of distance, r)". So per unit r, the change is dN/dr =5k r^4, which would mean the number of stars increases as r^4 per unit distance. So the answer should be C, ~r^4.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering the number of stars in a volume that's expanding with r. No, the problem states it's a specific region of the sky, so perhaps it's a surface density. Wait, surface density would be stars per unit area on the sky, but that's a different approach. Maybe I should think in terms of solid angle.

Wait, perhaps I'm making this more complicated than it needs to be. The problem says that the number of stars varies with parallax as 1/(plx)^5. So N ∝ 1/(plx)^5. Since plx = 1/d, N ∝ d^5. So as r increases, N grows as r^5. But the question is about the change in N per unit distance. So, for each small change in r (dr), how much does N change? That's the derivative dN/dr, which is 5 r^4. So the change is proportional to r^4. So the correct option is C, ~r^4.


The problem states that the number of stars in a specific region of the sky varies with parallax as \( N \propto \frac{1}{\text{plx}^5} \). Since parallax (\(\text{plx}\)) is inversely proportional to distance (\(d\)), i.e., \(\text{plx} = \frac{1}{d}\), we can substitute this into the relationship to find \( N \propto d^5 \). This means the number of stars increases with the fifth power of distance.

The question asks how the number of stars changes with distance per unit range of distance (\(r\)). To determine this, we calculate the derivative of \(N\) with respect to \(r\): 

\[
\frac{dN}{dr} \propto 5r^4
\]

Thus, the number of stars per unit distance increases as \(r^4\). Among the given options, the correct answer is:

**C) ~ \(r^4\)**
