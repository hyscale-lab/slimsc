Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is.

The problem is about finding the eigenvector of a quantum mechanical operator P for a muon along an arbitrary direction n lying in the x-z plane. The eigenvalue is +ħ/2. They gave me the components of the operator P in terms of matrices multiplied by ħ/2.

So, the operator P has components Px, Py, and Pz. Each of these is a 2x2 matrix multiplied by ħ/2.

Let me write down each component:

Px is (ħ/2) times the matrix:
[ [0, 1],
  [1, 0] ]

Similarly, Py is (ħ/2) times:
[ [0, -i],
  [i, 0] ]

And Pz is (ħ/2) times:
[ [1, 0],
  [0, -1] ]

Wait, so the operator P for an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane. I think the direction n would be a unit vector in the x-z plane. So n can be represented as (sinθ cosφ, 0, sinθ sinφ) or something like that? Wait, no—since it's in the x-z plane, the angle φ would be zero or π, but maybe I'm mixing spherical coordinates. Hmm, perhaps more accurately, any direction in x-z plane would have angles where the y-component is zero. So the direction can be characterized by an angle θ from the z-axis, and φ = 0 (since it's in the x-z plane, which is the φ=0 plane in spherical coordinates). So n would be (sinθ, 0, cosθ), but I'm not entirely sure if that's the exact parametrization. Alternatively, sometimes people use θ from the positive x-axis, but I think the standard is θ from the z-axis. Well, maybe I don't need to know the exact parametrization right now.

The operator P is the vector operator, so P = n · (Px, Py, Pz). Wait, no, wait. Wait, the operator is in the direction n, so the operator is P = n_x P_x + n_y P_y + n_z P_z. But
