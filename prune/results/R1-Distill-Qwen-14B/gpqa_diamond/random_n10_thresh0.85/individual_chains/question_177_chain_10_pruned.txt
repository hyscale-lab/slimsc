Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question is about.

The question says that there are two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than Star_2. Similarly, the mass of Star_1 is also 1.5 times that of Star_2. The astronomers found that the wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest are the same. Oh, and the radial velocities are 0 for Star_1 and 700 km/s for Star_2. The task is to find out by how much the luminosity of Star_1 is greater than Star_2, assuming they radiate as black bodies.

Hmm, okay. Luminosity of a star as a black body. I remember the Stefan-Boltzmann law, which says L = 4πR²σT⁴, where R is radius, T is temperature, and σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant. So luminosity depends on radius squared and temperature to the fourth power.

Wait, but the problem says they have the same wavelength where they appear brightest. Oh, right! The peak wavelength of a black body's emission is given by Wien's Law: λ_max = b / T, where b is Wien's displacement constant. So if their λ_max is the same, their temperatures must be the same. Because λ_max is inversely proportional to temperature.

Wait, but wait! Wait a second. Oh, but what about Doppler shift? Because the stars have different radial velocities, which would cause a shift in the observed wavelength. Oh, because Star_2 has a radial velocity of 700 km/s, which would affect the observed wavelength. So, we need to correct for that to find the actual temperatures, not the observed ones.

Because if Star_2 is moving towards us (assuming positive velocity is moving away), then its observed wavelength would be shifted. Wait, the formula for Doppler shift for wavelength is λ_obs = λ_rest * sqrt( (1 + v/c) / (1 - v/c) ) ), but actually, wait, the relativistic Doppler shift formula is:

λ_obs = λ_emitted * sqrt( (1 + v/c) / (1 - v/c) ), where v is the radial velocity (if moving away, it's positive). But wait, Star_1 has v=0, so its observed wavelength is the same as emitted. Star_2 has v=700 km/s. So, its observed wavelength is shifted.

But wait, the problem says that the wavelengths at which the stars appeared brightest (their λ_max) are the same. So, for Star_1, λ1_obs = λ1_emit, and for Star_2, λ2_obs = λ2_emit * Doppler factor.

But the observed λ_max for both are the same, so λ1_obs = λ2_obs. So:

λ1_emit = λ2_emit * sqrt( (1 + v/c) / (1 - v/c) )

But from Wien's law, λ_max is proportional to 1/T. So, λ1_emit = b / T1, λ2_emit = b / T2. So,

b/(T1) = (b/(T2)) * sqrt( (1 + v/c)/(1 - v/c) )

Canceling b,

1/T1 = (1/T2) * sqrt( (1 + v/c)/(1 - v/c) )

So,

T1 = T2 * sqrt( (1 - v/c) / (1 + v/c) )

Hmm, but wait, let's get the velocities straight. If Star_2 is moving away at 700 km/s, then v is positive (assuming v is in the same direction as the emission). Wait, but I'm not sure about the sign. Let me think. The Doppler shift formula for wavelength when the source is moving away is λ_obs = λ_source * sqrt( (1 + v/c)/(1 - v/c) ). So, if the source is moving away, the observed wavelength is longer.
