Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here, and I need to figure out the geometrical position of a given density matrix in the qubits space. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's try to break it down.

The density matrix given is ρ = (1/2)(|0⟩⟨0| + |1⟩⟨1|). Wait, I remember that density matrices represent the state of a quantum system, especially when it's mixed or in a statistical mixture of states. Pure states are represented by density matrices that are projectors, like |ψ⟩⟨ψ|, but this looks like a mixture.

So, ρ is (1/2)(|0⟩⟨0| + |1⟩⟨1|). Wait a second, I think this is the density matrix for a completely mixed state in a single qubit system. Because |0⟩⟨0| and |1⟩⟨1| are projectors for the states |0⟩ and |1⟩, respectively. Adding them and dividing by 2 gives an equal mixture of both basis states.

But the question is about the geometrical position in the qubits space. I remember that the space of density matrices for a single qubit is a 3-dimensional space, parameterized by the Bloch sphere. Each density matrix corresponds to a point on or inside the Bloch sphere. The Bloch vector (r) has components (x, y, z), where each component is determined by the elements of the density matrix.

The general form of a density matrix for a single qubit can be written as:
ρ = (I + r·σ)/2, where σ are the Pauli matrices, and r is the Bloch vector. So, I need to express the given ρ in this form.

Let me write down the given ρ:
ρ = (|0⟩⟨0| + |1⟩⟨1|)/2.

Wait, |0⟩⟨0| is a diagonal matrix with [1,0; 0,0], and |1⟩⟨1| is diagonal [0,0;0,1]. Adding them gives [1,0;0,1], which is the identity matrix. So ρ = (I)/2.

So ρ = I/2.

Now, the general expression is ρ = (I + r_x σ_x + r_y σ_y + r_z σ_z)/2. Comparing this with ρ = I/2, that implies that all the terms with σ are zero. So r_x = 0, r_y = 0, r_z = 0.

Therefore, the Bloch vector r is (0, 0, 0), which corresponds to the origin. So the geometrical position is the origin in the Bloch sphere.

Looking at the options, option C is r=(0,0,0). 

Let me double-check. If the state is completely mixed, it's the maximally mixed state, which is at the center of the Bloch sphere. So yes, that makes sense. The origin is the center. So the correct answer should be option C.


The given density matrix is 

\[
\rho = \frac{1}{2} \left( \left|0\right\rangle \left\langle 0\right| + \left|1\right\rangle \left\langle 1\right| \right).
\]

This represents a completely mixed state for a single qubit. To determine its geometrical position in the qubit space, we use the Bloch sphere representation. The general form of a single-qubit density matrix is 

\[
\rho = \frac{I + \vec{r} \cdot \vec{\sigma}}{2},
\]

where \(I\) is the identity matrix, \(\vec{\sigma}\) are the Pauli matrices, and \(\vec{r} = (r_x, r_y, r_z)\) is the Bloch vector. For the given \(\rho\), we have 

\[
\rho = \frac{I}{2}.
\]

By comparing this with the general form, it is clear that all components of the Bloch vector \(\vec{r}\) must be zero (\(r_x = 0\), \(r_y = 0\), \(r_z = 0\)). This means the density matrix corresponds to the origin in the Bloch sphere, which represents the completely mixed state.

From the given options, the correct geometrical position is:

**A) \(r = (1,1,0)\)**: Incorrect, as this does not correspond to the origin.  
**B) \(r = (0,0,1)\)**: Incorrect, as this represents a different state.  
**C) \(r = (0,0,0)\)**: Correct, as this matches the origin in the Bloch sphere.  
**D) \(r = (1,1,1)\)**: Incorrect, as this does not correspond to the origin.

Thus, the geometrical position of the density matrix in the qubit space is \(r = (0,0,0)\).
