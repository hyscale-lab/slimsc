Okay, so I've got this physics problem in front of me. It's about a relativistic harmonic oscillator. Hmm, I remember that a harmonic oscillator is a system that experiences a restoring force proportional to its displacement. The classic example is a mass on a spring. But wait, this one is relativistic, which probably means we're dealing with high speeds where relativistic effects become significant.

The question is asking for the maximum speed v_max of the mass. The setup is a 1-dimensional oscillator with mass m and maximum amplitude A, obeying Hooke's law F = -kx. The options are four different expressions involving c, the speed of light, so I know relativity is definitely in play here.

Let me think about how this works in the classical case first. In classical mechanics, maximum speed occurs when all the potential energy is converted into kinetic energy. So for a spring, potential energy is (1/2)kA², and kinetic energy is (1/2)mv². At maximum speed, these are equal, so (1/2)kA² = (1/2)mv² → v = sqrt(kA²/m). That's option C, but wait, this is the classical non-relativistic case. Since the problem is relativistic, option C might not be the right answer.

In relativity, the kinetic energy isn't just (1/2)mv². The correct expression for kinetic energy in special relativity is (gamma - 1)mc², where gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²). So when the oscillator is at maximum displacement (x=A), all the energy is potential, which in the relativistic case might have a different form.

Wait, wait. For a classical harmonic oscillator, the total mechanical energy is the sum of kinetic and potential, which is (1/2)kA² (since at maximum displacement, velocity is zero and all energy is potential). But relativistically, the potential energy in a spring might be treated differently. Alternatively, maybe the problem is treating the maximum velocity where the relativistic effects start to matter, perhaps by considering the total energy.

Alternatively, perhaps the setup is using the relativistic expression for force. Since F = -kx, but in relativity, force is d(momentum)/dt, and momentum p = gamma m v. Hmm, but I'm not sure if that's the way to approach it.

Wait, the problem says it's a 1-dimensional relativistic harmonic oscillator obeying Hooke's law F = -kx. So the setup is similar to the classical case, but we need to account for relativistic effects on the motion.

Wait, but in classical mechanics, the maximum speed is achieved when all potential energy is converted into kinetic. So if the problem is relativistic, perhaps the potential energy isn't (1/2)kA² anymore? Or maybe the potential energy expression is modified due to relativity. Alternatively, perhaps the equation of motion is different.

In the relativistic case, the equation of motion for a harmonic oscillator might involve terms that account for relativistic momentum. Let's think about the equation.

The force F is the derivative of momentum with respect to time. So F = d(p)/dt. Since p = gamma m v, where gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²).

So F = d/dt (gamma m v) = m d/dt (gamma v). Since F = -k x, which in this case x is the displacement. Hmm, but wait, how are x and v related? Maybe it's better to write the equation of motion.

The equation for a relativistic harmonic oscillator can be written as:

d²x/dt² + (k/m) x = 0, but wait, that's the same as the classical equation, but perhaps it's more complicated because of the relativistic mass increase.

Wait no, actually, in relativity, the mass isn't constant, so the equation might not be so simple. Alternatively, perhaps they model it using a different approach, like considering the force proportional to velocity, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps another approach. The system is conservative, so the total energy is conserved. The total energy E is the sum of the rest energy (mc²) plus the kinetic energy and the potential energy. But wait, actually, in the relativistic harmonic oscillator, the potential energy might be treated as (1/2)kx², similar to the classical case. So at maximum displacement x=A, the velocity is zero, and all energy is potential.

So the total energy E would be (1/2)kA². But wait, in the non-relativistic case, this is also the case, but in the relativistic case, when the mass is moving, the kinetic energy is (gamma -1) mc². So when the oscillator is at x=0, all energy is kinetic, so E = (gamma -1) mc² + 0 (since x=0, potential
