Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics question about matrices and their properties. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to work through it step by step.

The question provides four matrices: W, X, Y, Z. Each is a 3x3 matrix. The options (A to D) make statements about these matrices related to quantum mechanics concepts.

First, I need to understand each option. Let's go through them one by one.

Option A: "There exists a vector to which if one multiplies e^X, the norm of the vector changes." Hmm. So this is about the exponential of matrix X. In quantum mechanics, the evolution operator is supposed to be unitary, which implies that e^(-iH) is unitary if H is Hermitian. But wait, what about e^X? For the norm to change, e^X must not be unitary. Because if it's unitary, multiplying by it preserves the norm.

So, whether e^X is unitary depends on X. Let me think about X. The matrix X is given as:

X = (i, -1, 2i;
     1, 0, 1;
     2i, -1, -i)

Wait, to check if e^X is unitary, I might need to know if X is anti-Hermitian. Because for e^X to be unitary, X should be anti-Hermitian. So, let me compute X† (the conjugate transpose) and see if it's equal to -X.

Let's compute X†. The conjugate transpose means taking the transpose and then the complex conjugate.

Original X:
Row 1: i, -1, 2i
Row 2: 1, 0, 1
Row 3: 2i, -1, -i

Transposing X (swap rows and columns):

Column 1: i, 1, 2i
Column 2: -1, 0, -1
Column 3: 2i, 1, -i

Now, taking the complex conjugate of each element:

Conj of X† would be:

Row 1: i*, 1*, (2i)* → -i, 1, -2i
Row 2: (-1)*, 0*, 1* → -1, 0, 1
Row 3: (2i)*, (-1)*, (-i)* → -2i, -1, i

Wait, wait—no, I think I messed up. Let me redo this. When you take the conjugate transpose, each element (i,j) becomes (j,i)*.

So, X† is:

For X, the element (1,1) is i → in X†, it's (1,1) becomes i* → -i.

(1,2) in X is -1 → in X†, (2,1) is (-1)* → -1.

(1,3) in X is 2i → X† (3,1) is (2i)* → -2i.

Similarly, row 2 of X becomes column 2 of X†:

(2,1) in X is 1 → X† (1,2) is 1* → 1.

(2,2) is 0 → remains 0.

(2,3) is 1 → X† (3,2) is 1* → 1.

Row 3 of X:

(3,1) is 2i → X† (1,3) is (2i)* → -2i.

(3,2) is -1 → X† (2,3) is (-1)* → -1.

(3,3) is -i → X† (3,3) is (-i)* → i.

So putting it all together, X† is:

Row 1: -i, 1, -2i

Row 2: -1, 0, -1

Row 3: -2i, i, -i

Wait, did I get that right? Let me write X† step by step. Maybe I should write X's transpose first, then take the conjugate.

Original X:

Row 1: [i, -1, 2i]

Row 2: [1, 0, 1]

Row 3: [2i, -1, -i]

Transpose of X (swap rows and columns):

Column 1: i, 1, 2i → becomes row 1: i, 1, 2i

Column 2: -1, 0, -1 → row 2: -1, 0, -1

Column 3: 2i, 1, -i → row 3: 2i, 1, -i

Now, take the conjugate of each element in the transposed matrix.

Conjugate of i is -i.

Conjugate of 1 is 1.

Conjugate of 2i is -2i.

Conjugate of -1 is -1.

Conjugate of 0 is 0.

Conjugate of 1 is 1.

Conjugate of 2i is -2i.

Conjugate of 1 is 1.

Conjugate of -i is i.

So X† is:

Row 1: -i, 1, -2i

Row 2: -1, 0, -1

Row 3: -2i, 1, i

Wait, that's different. So X† is not equal to -X. Let's compute -X.

-X is:

Row 1: -i, 1, -2i

Row 2: -1, 0, -1

Row 3: -2i, 1, i

Wait a minute! Comparing X† and -X: 

X† is:

Row 1: -i, 1, -2i

Row 2: -1, 0, -1

Row 3: -2i, 1, i

And -X is:

-X = -(X) = 

Row 1: -i, 1, -2i

Row 2: -1, 0, -1

Row 3: -2i, 1, i

Wait, so X† equals -X. Oh! So X is
