Okay, so I have this question about stars and spectrographs. Hmm, I remember that spectrographs are instruments used to study the light from stars, right? The question is asking which stars can be detected by both the ESPRESSO spectrograph at Paranal and the HIRES spectrograph at Keck.

Wait, the key here is to figure out which stars are bright enough for both instruments. I remember that ESPRESSO can observe stars brighter than V magnitude 17, and HIRES can handle brighter than 16.5. Wait, no, wait. Let me check: the question says ESPRESSO can observe stars with V mag brighter than 17. HIRES can observe brighter than 16.5? Or is it the other way around? No, I think the question says that ESPRESSO can observe stars brighter than 17 mag in V, meaning apparent V magnitude less than or equal to 17. Wait, no, wait a second—apparent magnitude is how bright they appear from Earth. Wait, no, wait, the question says that with ESPRESSO, stars with apparent V magnitudes brighter than 17 can be observed. Oh, brighter than 17 means lower apparent magnitude numbers because lower magnitudes are brighter. So apparent magnitude 17 is dimmer than 16, which is brighter than 17.

Wait, let me clarify. The question says, for ESPRESSO, stars with apparent V brighter than 17 mag can be observed. So if a star's apparent magnitude is less than or equal to 17, it's observable. Because in astronomy, lower magnitudes are brighter. So, if a star's apparent V is 17, ESPRESSO can observe it. Similarly, HIRES can observe stars with apparent V brighter than 16, so apparent V ≤16.5.

Wait, no, the question says "brighter than 17 mag"—so the apparent magnitude is less than 17. Because if a star's apparent mag is smaller than 17, it's brighter. For example, an apparent mag of 16 is brighter than 17.

So for each star, I need to calculate their apparent V magnitude, considering any extinction (dust absorption), and then see which ones are ≤17 for ESPRESSO and ≤16.5 for HIRES. Because both would need to observe the star, the star's apparent magnitude must be ≤16.5 (since 16.5 is
