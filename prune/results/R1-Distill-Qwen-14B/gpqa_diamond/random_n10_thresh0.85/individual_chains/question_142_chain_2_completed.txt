Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here about density matrices and their geometrical positions in qubit space. Hmm, I remember that density matrices are used to describe the state of a quantum system, especially when it's in a mixed state. But wait, the question is about where this particular density matrix is located in the qubit space. I'm a bit fuzzy on the details, but let me think.

The given density matrix ρ is (1/2)(|0><0| + |1><1|). I think that's a diagonal matrix because the off-diagonal terms are zero. Let me write that out. The standard basis states |0> and |1> are orthonormal, so their outer products would be diagonal matrices. So |0><0| would be a matrix with 1 in the (0,0) position and zeros elsewhere. Similarly, |1><1| has 1 in (1,1). Adding them and multiplying by 1/2 would give a matrix with 1/2 in the (0,0) and (1,1) positions, and zeros elsewhere.

Wait, but what's the geometrical position here? I think it's about the Bloch sphere representation. Oh right, the Bloch sphere is a way to represent qubit states. For a pure state, the density matrix is a projector, like |ψ><ψ|. But this ρ isn't a pure state because it's a mixture of |0> and |1>. So it should lie somewhere on the Bloch sphere, but not on the surface—maybe on the surface if it's a pure state, but wait, no, wait. Wait, for a single qubit, the density matrix can be represented as a point on the Bloch sphere. Oh, or is it that pure states lie on the surface, and mixed states inside?

Wait, the density matrix for a mixed state is a statistical mixture of projectors. So in this case, the given ρ is (|0><0| + |1><1|)/2. That's equivalent to a completely mixed state for a single qubit. So what does that look like on the Bloch sphere? I think the completely mixed state is the maximally mixed state, which is in the center of the Bloch sphere. Because all the information is completely lost, the state has maximum entropy.

The Bloch sphere is parameterized by a vector r = (x,y,z), where each component corresponds to the expectation values of the Pauli matrices. For a density matrix ρ, the vector r is given by r = 2 Tr(ρ σ), where σ are the Pauli matrices. Wait, no, more precisely, the expectation values are ⟨σ_x⟩ = Tr(ρ σ_x), same for σ_y and σ_z.

So for a completely mixed state like (|0><0| + |1><1|)/2, let's compute these expectation values. Let me think about each Pauli matrix:

σ_x is [[0,1],[1,0]]
σ_y is [[0,-i],[i,0]]
σ_z is [[1,0],[0,-1]]

So ρ is (1/2) (|0><0| + |1><1|) = [[1/2, 0],[0,1/2]].

Calculating Tr(ρ σ_x) = (1/2)(1)(1) + (1/2)(1)(1) → wait, no, wait. Let's compute ρ σ_x:

ρ σ_x = (1/2) (|0><0| + |1><1|) * σ_x.

But σ_x flips the basis, so σ_x |0> = |1>, σ_x |1> = |0>. So actually, ρ σ_x would be (1/2)(|0><0| σ_x + |1><1| σ_x) = (1/2)(|1><0| + |0><1|). Then Tr(ρ σ_x) is the trace of that matrix, which is (1/2)(0) + (1/2)(0) → 0. Same for σ_y. For σ_z: ρ σ_z = (1/2)(|0><0| σ_z + |1><1| σ_z) = (1/2)(|0><0|*1 + |1><1|*(-1)). So the matrix is [[1/2, 0],[0, -1/2]]. The trace is Tr(ρ σ_z) = (1/2) - (1/2) = 0.

So r would be (⟨σ_x⟩, ⟨σ_y⟩, ⟨σ_z⟩) = (0, 0, 0). Because all the expectation values are zero.

Wait, but the options don't have (0,0,0) as the first option. Let me check the options again.

Option C is r=(0,0,0). So this would be the correct answer. But let me make sure.

Alternatively, maybe I'm mixing up the parametrization. I remember that the Bloch vector has components (x,y,z), where x=⟨σ_x⟩, y=⟨σ_y⟩, z=⟨σ_z⟩. For a maximally mixed state, the density matrix is (I/2), which is the same as this ρ. So the Bloch vector is zero, meaning the point is at the origin. So the geometrical position is (0,0,0), which is option C.


The given density matrix is 

\[
\rho = \frac{1}{2}\left(|0\rangle \langle 0| + |1\rangle \langle 1|\right).
\]

This is a diagonal matrix with entries \(\frac{1}{2}\) in the \((0,0)\) and \((1,1)\) positions, and zeros elsewhere. This represents a maximally mixed state for a single qubit, which corresponds to the origin of the Bloch sphere. 

The Bloch sphere is parameterized by a vector \(\mathbf{r} = (x, y, z)\), where \(x = \langle \sigma_x \rangle\), \(y = \langle \sigma_y \rangle\), and \(z = \langle \sigma_z \rangle\). For the given density matrix, the expectation values of the Pauli matrices are calculated as follows:

- \(\langle \sigma_x \rangle = \text{Tr}(\rho \sigma_x) = 0\),
- \(\langle \sigma_y \rangle = \text{Tr}(\rho \sigma_y) = 0\),
- \(\langle \sigma_z \rangle = \text{Tr}(\rho \sigma_z) = 0\).

Thus, the Bloch vector is \(\mathbf{r} = (0, 0, 0)\), which corresponds to the center of the Bloch sphere. This matches option C.

Answer: C
