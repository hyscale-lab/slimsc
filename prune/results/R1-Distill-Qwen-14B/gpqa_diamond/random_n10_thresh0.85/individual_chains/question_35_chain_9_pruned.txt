Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here about angular momentum operators. Hmm, let me try to think through it step by step. I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's see.

The question is about the Y-component of the intrinsic angular momentum operator, A, for a muon. The operator Ay is given as a 2x2 matrix, and it's written as c times S. Oh wait, c is h/(4π) and S is a 2x2 matrix with first row (0, -i) and second row (i, 0).

So, the task is to find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of Ay. Then, we have to look at the given options and pick the correct statement.

First, let me recall that the eigenvalue equation is Ay φ = a φ, where a is the eigenvalue. Since Ay is a 2x2 matrix, the eigenvalues should be found by solving the characteristic equation: det(Ay - a I) = 0.

But wait, what is the matrix form of Ay? Let's compute that. The matrix S is:
[ 0  -i ]
[ i   0 ]

So, multiply this by c = h/(4π).

So Ay = c * S =
[ 0      -i c ]
[ i c     0  ]

Which becomes:
[ 0       -i*(h/(4π)) ]
[ i*(h/(4π))   0 ]

So the matrix Ay is:
[ 0           (-i h)/(4π)  ]
[ (i h)/(4π)    0          ]

Now, to find the eigenvalues, I need to compute the determinant of (Ay - a I). The matrix Ay - a I would be:

[ -a         (-i h)/(4π) ]
[ (i h)/(4π)   -a        ]

The determinant is (-a)(-a) - [ (-i h/(4π))(i h/(4π)) ].

Calculating each part: (-a)(-a) = a². The other term is ( -i h/(4π) )*(i h/(4π) ) = (-i)(i) * (h²)/(16 π²). Since (-i)(i) is (-i^2) = -(-1) = 1. So the term becomes (h²)/(16 π²).

So determinant is a² - (h²)/(16 π²) = 0. Therefore, a² = (h²)/(16 π²). Taking square roots, a = ± h/(4π).

So the eigenvalues are a = h/(4π) and a = -h/(4π). Wait, but option A says the imaginary parts are ±2πh and real parts ±h/(4π). That doesn't seem right, because our eigenvalues are purely real here. Hmm, that can't be. Wait, wait, did I make a mistake?

Wait, wait, no. Wait a second: the matrix Ay is Hermitian? Let me check. The matrix Ay is made by c times S. S is [ 0 -i; i 0 ]. Is S Hermitian? Let's see, the conjugate transpose of S is [ 0 i; -i 0 ] because taking transpose and complex conjugate. But S itself is [0 -i; i 0]. So what's its conjugate transpose? For S, the (1,2) element is -i, so the conjugate is i. So the conjugate transpose would be [0 i; -i 0], which is not equal to S. Therefore, S isn't Hermitian. So Ay might not be Hermitian. But wait, angular momentum operators are supposed to be Hermitian, right? Because they correspond to observables. Hmm, but the way it's given, S must be a spin matrix. Wait, S is the Pauli matrices? Wait, wait, no, the Pauli matrices are σx, σy, σz. Let me think.

Wait, S is given as a 2x2 matrix with [0 -i; i 0]. Wait, that looks like the Y Pauli matrix but multiplied by i. Because the Pauli Y matrix is usually [0 -i; i 0]. Wait, no, wait: the Pauli Y matrix is [0 -i; i 0], right? So matrix S is actually the Y Pauli matrix. Because the Pauli matrices are:

σx = [[0,1],[1,0]]
σy = [[0,-i],[i,0]]
σz = [[1,0],[0,-1]]

So yes, our matrix S is σy. Therefore, the operator Ay is c times σy, where c is h/(4π). So Ay = (h/(4π))σy.

Wait, but σy is Hermitian because it's equal to its conjugate transpose. Let's check: σy is [[0,-i],[i,0]]. Conjugate transpose would swap elements and take conjugates. So (σy)^dagger is [[0,i],[-i,0]], which is the same as σy because (-i) becomes i and i becomes -i, but since the positions are swapped... Wait, no. Let me compute it properly. The conjugate of [0 -i; i 0] is [0 i; -i 0]. Which is the same as σy^T. So is σy equal to its conjugate transpose? Let me compute σy^dagger.

σy^dagger = [[0, i], [-i, 0]]

Which is not the same as σy, which is [[0,-i],[i,0]]. So σy is not Hermitian? That can't be right. Wait, no, wait, I must have made a mistake because I thought σy is Hermitian. Let me recheck.

Wait, the Pauli matrices are Hermitian. Because, for example, σy^dagger is the same as σy.

Wait, let's compute σy^dagger. The original σy is [[0, -i], [i, 0]]. So the conjugate of each element: 0 remains 0; (-i) becomes i; i becomes -i; 0 remains 0. Then transpose the matrix. The transpose of σy is [[0,i],[-i,0]]. So σy^dagger is [[0,i],[-i,0]]. But σy itself is [[0,-i],[i,0]]. Are these equal? No, because the (1,2) element is i in σy^dagger, but -i in σy. So that's not the same. So σy is not Hermitian? That can't be right because the Pauli matrices are known to be Hermitian. Hmm, maybe I'm making a mistake in calculation.

Wait, wait, let me compute σy^dagger again. The dagger operator is the conjugate transpose. So for σy:

σy = [ [0, -i], [i, 0] ]

To get σy^dagger, first transpose the matrix and then take the complex conjugate of each element.

Transposing σy:

[ [0, i], 
  [-i, 0] ]

Now, taking complex conjugate:

[ [0, -i],
  [i, 0] ]

Which is the same as the original σy. Oh wait, yes! Because the original σy is [0, -i; i, 0], and the conjugate transpose after transposing and conjugating gives [0, -i; i, 0], which is the same as σy. So yes, σy is Hermitian. So I must have made a
