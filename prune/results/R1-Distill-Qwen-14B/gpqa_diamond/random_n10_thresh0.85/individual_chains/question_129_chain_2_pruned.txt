Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit stuck, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question says.

The problem is about a reaction scheme involving several compounds, A to E, and I need to identify compound E based on the given reaction steps and hints. Hmm, okay, I'll start by breaking down each reaction step and see what each transformation implies.

First, the reaction steps are:

1. Compound A reacts with HCN to form compound B.
2. Compound B is reduced with H2 in the presence of Pd to form compound C.
3. Compound C reacts with HNO2 to form compound D.
4. Compound D undergoes elimination of an inert gas to form compound E.

Plus, there are two hints provided. Let's look at them too. 

Hint a) says that compound A, when reacted with an unknown phosphorous ylide, forms 1,2-dimethyl-4-(propan-2-ylidene)cyclopentane. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on ylides, but I remember that ylides are used in alkylation reactions, especially in the formation of carbonyl groups. Oh wait, the Wittig reaction! Right, the Wittig reagent (ylide) reacts with aldehydes or ketones to form alkenes. So the product here is an alkene, which suggests that compound A is a ketone because the Wittig reaction typically forms alkenes from ketones.

So compound A is a ketone. That fits with the IR hint as well. Because ketones have a strong C=O peak around 1715 cm^-1, but wait, hint b) says that compound A's IR is around 1750 cm^-1. Oh, wait, maybe it's an ester or another carbonyl compound. Let me think. Usually, esters and aldehydes have a higher wavenumber than ketones. For example, aldehydes have around 1720, esters maybe a bit higher. Wait, I'm not sure about the exact numbers, but I think ketones are around 1715, aldehydes maybe around 1720-1740, and esters perhaps a bit higher like 1735-1765. So if compound A's IR is at 1750 cm^-1, it's probably an ester or maybe an aldehyde. But wait, the product of the Wittig reaction is an alkene, so if A is an aldehyde, then the Wittig would form an alkene. But in the product, the structure is 1,2-dimethyl-4-(propan-2-ylidene)cyclopentane. Let's parse that structure.

The product is a cyclopentane ring with substituents. The main ring has 1,2-dimethyl groups, and at position 4, there's a propan-2-ylidene group. The propan-2-ylidene is a propene group attached via the central carbon, which is a carbene? Wait, no, ylides are carbanions, so when they react with carbonyls, they form alkenes.

Wait, maybe it's better to draw it mentally. The starting material A is reacting with a Wittig reagent (ylide) to form an alkene. So A must have a carbonyl group. So A is a ketone or aldehyde.

But the product after the Wittig will have a new double bond. Let me think about the product structure again: 1,2-dimethyl-4-(propan-2-ylidene)cyclopentane. So the cyclopentane ring has two methyl groups on carbons 1 and 2. Then on carbon 4, there's a propan-2-ylidene group. Wait, propan-2-ylidene would be CH2-C(CH3)= something? No, propan-2-ylidene would be CH2-C(=)CH2? Wait, no, propan-2-ylidene is (propane-2-yl)idene, which is CH2-CH(C)- ?

Wait, maybe I should think about the product structure. The product is a cyclopentane ring with substituents. Let me imagine the structure:

- The cyclopentane has a substituent on carbon 4 which is a propan-2-ylidene group. Propan-2-ylidene would be a propene group where the double bond is between C2 and C3, and it's attached to the cyclopentane at C4. So the substituent would look like CH2-C(CH
