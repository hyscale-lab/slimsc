Okay, so I'm trying to figure out where this density matrix is located in the qubit space. Hmm, the matrix given is ρ = (1/2)(|0⟩⟨0| + |1⟩⟨1|). Wait, I remember that a density matrix for a qubit can be represented as a point in a 3-dimensional space, right? Because qubits are two-level systems, their state can be described using Bloch vectors in a 3D sphere.

So the general form of a density matrix for a qubit is ρ = (I + r·σ)/2, where σ represents the Pauli matrices and r is the Bloch vector. Oh wait, the I here is the identity matrix. So when I expand that, it should be (|0⟩⟨0| + |1⟩⟨1| + other terms involving σx, σy, σz) all multiplied by 1/2.

Looking at the given ρ, it's (|0⟩⟨0| + |1⟩⟨1|) multiplied by 1/2. So comparing this to the general form, the other terms (those involving the Pauli matrices) must be zero. That means the coefficients for σx, σy, and σz are all zero. So the Bloch vector r must be (0, 0, 0), right?

Wait, because the general expression includes all three Pauli terms. So in the given ρ, the only terms are the identity part and the |0⟩⟨0| + |1⟩⟨1|, which is the same as the identity matrix, right? Because |0⟩⟨0| + |1⟩⟨1| equals I for a qubit. So the given ρ is (I)/2, which is the maximally mixed state.

Maximally mixed state would have no direction in the Bloch sphere. So the Bloch vector r is at the origin. So the point is (0,0,0). Looking at the options, option C is (0,0,0), so that's the answer.

Wait, but let me make sure I didn't mix up anything. Another way to think about it is the density matrix for a completely mixed state. For a qubit, the maximally mixed state is (I)/2, which indeed corresponds to the origin in the Bloch sphere. So yeah, the correct answer must be option C.


The given density matrix is 

\[
\rho = \frac{1}{2} \left( \left|0\right\rangle \left\langle 0\right| + \left|1\right\rangle \left\langle 1\right| \right).
\]

For a single qubit, the density matrix can generally be expressed as 

\[
\rho = \frac{1}{2} \left( I + \mathbf{r} \cdot \boldsymbol{\sigma} \right),
\]

where \( I \) is the identity matrix, \( \boldsymbol{\sigma} \) represents the Pauli matrices, and \( \mathbf{r} = (r_x, r_y, r_z) \) is the Bloch vector. Comparing this to the given \( \rho \), it is evident that the terms involving the Pauli matrices (\( \mathbf{r} \cdot \boldsymbol{\sigma} \)) are absent, meaning \( r_x = r_y = r_z = 0 \). Thus, the Bloch vector is \( \mathbf{r} = (0, 0, 0) \).

This corresponds to the maximally mixed state, which is represented as the origin in the Bloch sphere. Among the options provided, the correct geometrical position is \( r = (0, 0, 0) \).

Answer: C
