Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this neutrino flux ratio problem. Let's see, the question is about what happens when the pp-III branch in the Sun's core stops suddenly, and how that affects the neutrino flux in two specific energy bands. 

Hmm, wait, I remember that the pp chain is a series of reactions in the Sun that eventually leads to helium production. The pp-III branch is one part of that process. Neutrinos are produced in these reactions, right? Specifically, the main neutrinos are the electron neutrinos from the fusion processes.

So, the pp-III branch stopping means that this particular part of the proton-proton cycle isn't happening anymore. But all other reactions remain the same. So, other branches like pp-I and pp-II are still active, and maybe other fusion processes are too, like the CNO cycle perhaps?

I think the pp-III branch produces a certain energy of neutrinos. I remember that the pp reactions mainly produce lower energy neutrinos. The dominant neutrinos from the pp chain are around a few hundred keV, like in the 200-800 keV range. Wait, but I'm not exactly sure about the exact energy ranges. 

So the question is about two bands: 700-800 keV (band 1) and 800-900 keV (band 2). We need to find the flux ratio F1/F2.

If the pp-III branch stops, that probably affects the production of neutrinos in a certain energy range. Since the pp-III branch is part of the proton-proton chain, which mainly contributes to lower-energy neutrinos, stopping it would reduce the number of neutrinos in that lower band. But the higher energy bands might have other sources, like the CNO cycle or maybe higher-energy processes.

Wait, the CNO cycle produces higher-energy neutrinos. Or is it the other way around? No, wait, the CNO cycle is a more efficient hydrogen burning process in higher metallicity stars, but in the Sun, the pp chain is dominant. But even so, the CNO cycle produces more energetic particles? Or does it produce similar neutrinos? Hmm, I'm a bit hazy on that.

Alternatively, maybe the pp-III branch is a specific part that emits neutrinos of a certain energy. So, if it stops, that would reduce the flux in the band where those neutrinos fall. 

So, band 1 is 700-800 keV. If the pp-III branch is a major source of neutrinos in that range, stopping it would mean that band 1's flux drops. What about band 2, 800-900 keV? If that band's neutrinos come from other processes like pp-I or II or CNO, their flux might not be affected as much.

Wait, but I'm not sure about the exact energy distribution of the neutrinos from different branches. Let me think. The pp chain produces neutrinos when a boron-8 nucleus decays into carbon-8, which emits a neutrino. The energy of these neutrinos is about 1.4 MeV, but wait, wait, that can't be right because 1.4 MeV is 1400 keV. So, if pp-III is producing that, then the neutrino energy is around 1.4 MeV, which would fall into band 2 (800-
