Okay, so I'm trying to solve this organic chemistry problem. Let me read through it carefully and think it through step by step.

The question is about identifying a compound based on its NMR data and then determining the product after a series of reactions. The compound has the molecular formula C8H9NO. The reagents are NaNO2 + HCl, followed by H2O, and then aq. KOH with heat.

First, I'll look at the NMR data to figure out the structure of the starting compound. The 1H NMR data is as follows:

- 9.72 ppm: triplet integrating to 1H. That's probably an aldehyde proton because aldehydes typically show up around 9-10 ppm as sharp singlets or triplets, depending on neighboring protons. Here, it's a triplet, which might suggest coupling with two equivalent protons, maybe adjacent to a CH2 group.

- 6.98 ppm: doublet, 2H. This could be aromatic protons. Maybe a para-substituted benzene ring because the doublet suggests each proton is next to one other. Alternatively, maybe a meta substitution, but I'm not sure yet.

- 6.51 ppm: doublet, 2H. Another set of aromatic protons. The two doublets might indicate two different sets of aromatic protons, possibly from two substituents on a benzene ring. Wait, but maybe there are two benzene rings. Because the integration adds up to 4 aromatic protons (2H each), but the molecular formula is C8H9NO. Let me check: the formula has 8 carbons.

Wait, the molecular formula is C8H9NO. Let me calculate the degrees of unsaturation. Degrees of unsaturation formula: Degrees = (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. Where C is number of carbons, H hydrogens, X halogens, N nitrogens. So here, C=8, H=9, N=1. So (2*8 +2 -9 -0 +1)/2 = (18 -9 +1)/2 = (10)/2 = 5. So 5 degrees: could be one ring and two double bonds, or a ring and a triple bond, etc. Wait, but for this molecule, let me think.

Looking at the NMR, the aldehyde suggests one double bond (the aldehyde's carbonyl), and the aromatic regions suggest two benzene rings (each with 2 protons in doublets) maybe. Alternatively, perhaps one benzene ring with substituents. Wait, but in the NMR, after the aldehyde and the aromatic protons, there's more signals.

Looking further, the NMR data continues:

- 6.27 ppm: broad singlet, 2H. Broad suggests maybe an exchange, like an -OH group, but integration is 2H. Alternatively, maybe it's from a diene or some coupling. Or perhaps this is a vinyl proton between two substituents, which is causing a broad signal due to rapid exchange.

- 3.66 ppm: doublet, 2H. This is a CH2 group. The doublet suggests each proton is adjacent to another equivalent proton. So maybe an OCH2 group. Like attached to an oxygen, such as an ether or an ester.

Hmm, putting this together. Let me try to sketch a possible structure.

The aldehyde group is present. So there's an RCHO group. Then, the aromatic signals. Let me see if I can figure out the substitution pattern.

The aldehyde proton is at 9.72, triplet. So perhaps the aldehyde is at the end of a chain, next to a CH2 group. Like CH2-CHO. But the CH2 would be adjacent to something else.

The 3.66 ppm is a doublet with 2H, so maybe a CH2 connected to something else
