Okay, so I've got this problem about a rhombohedral crystal, and I need to find the interplanar distance for the (111) plane. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my crystallography, but let me think this through step by step.

First, I remember that in crystallography, the interplanar distance d is given by the formula involving the lattice parameters and the Miller indices. For a general crystal system, the formula is something like d = a / sqrt( (h² + k² + l²)/(something) ) but I might be mixing things up.

Wait, no, I think the correct formula is d_{hkl} = a/(sqrt( (h^2 + k^2 + l^2)/(something) )) but that's not quite right. Oh right, in a cubic system, it's d = a / sqrt(h² + k² + l²), but rhombohedral is not cubic. Oh wait, in a rhombohedral system, the formula is a bit different because the angles aren't 90 degrees.

Wait, the general formula for interplanar distances in a crystal is derived from the unit cell parameters. For a rhombohedral system, all edges are the same length 'a' (since it's a special case of a hexagonal system?), no, wait, rhombohedral is part of the cubic system but with angles not 90 degrees. So the unit cell has a = b = c, but angles alpha, beta, gamma are not 90. So the formula for interplanar distance would involve the metric tensor or the structure factor approach.

I recall that the general formula for d_{hkl} in terms of the unit cell parameters a, b, c, and the angles between them is:

d_{hkl} = 1 / sqrt( (h^2/(a^2)) + (k^2/(b^2)) + (l^2/(c^2)) + ... some cross terms involving the angles. Oh wait, because in a cubic system, a=b=c and angles are 90, so the cross terms vanish, simplifying to 1/sqrt( h² +k² + l² ) * a.

But for rhombohedral, since a = b = c, but angles are not
