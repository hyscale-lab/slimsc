Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here about the Y-component of the intrinsic angular momentum operator for a muon. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's try to think it through.

The problem states that Ay is a 2x2 matrix given by c multiplied by S, where c is h/(4π) and S is another 2x2 matrix. The first row of S is (0, -i) and the second row is (i, 0). So, I should write out what Ay looks like.

Let me compute that. c is h/(4π), so Ay = (h/(4π)) * S. So the matrix S is [[0, -i], [i, 0]]. Multiplying each element by c, Ay becomes [[0, -(ih/(4π))], [i h/(4π), 0]]. Wait, maybe I should write it as fractions. So, the matrix is:

Ay = [ [0, -i h/(4π)], [i h/(4π), 0] ]

Wait, actually, let me compute S first. S is [[0, -i], [i, 0]]. Then, Ay is (h/(4π)) * S, so each element is multiplied by h/(4π). So the (1,2) element is -i * h/(4π), and the (2,1) is i * h/(4π). So Ay is:

[ 0, (-i h)/(4π) ]
[ (i h)/(4π), 0 ]

Now, I'm supposed to find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of Ay. Remember, to find eigenvalues, I need to solve the characteristic equation det(Ay - a I) = 0, where a is the eigenvalue.

So the matrix Ay - a I would be:

[ -a, (-i h)/(4π) ]
[ (i h)/(4π), -a ]

The determinant is (-a)(-a) - [ (-i h/(4π)) * (i h/(4π)) ) ] = a² - [ (-i)(i) (h²)/(16 π²) ]

Wait, let's compute the product in the determinant. The product of the off-diagonal elements is [ (-i h/(4π))(i h/(4π)) ) ] = (-i)(i) * (h²)/(16 π²) ) 

But (-i)(i) = -i² = -(-1) = 1. So this product becomes (h²)/(16 π²) ) * 1 = h²/(16 π²).

So the determinant is a² - [ h²/(16 π²) ] = 0.

So, a² = h²/(16 π²) → a = ± h/(4π), right?

Wait, wait, that seems straightforward. So the eigenvalues are a = h/(4π) and a = -h/(4π). But wait, looking at the options, none of them seem to directly match this conclusion. Let me check the options again.

Option A says the imaginary part of the eigenvalue is ±2πh, real part ±h/(4π). Wait, but eigenvalues here are real numbers, right? Because Ay is a Hermitian matrix? Wait, is Ay Hermitian?

Wait, wait. Let me think. The matrix S is [[0, -i], [i, 0]]. Let me check if S is Hermitian. The conjugate transpose of S would be [[0, i], [-i, 0]], which is the same as S because (i, -i) becomes (-i, i) after conjugation. Wait, no. Let me compute S†.

S is:

Row 1: 0, -i

Row 2: i, 0

Conjugate transpose (S†) would be:

Column 1 becomes row 1: 0, i → first row is [0, i]

Column 2 becomes row 2: -i, 0 → second row is [-i, 0]

So S† is [[0, i], [-i, 0]], but S is [[0, -i], [i, 0]]. So S† = [[0, i], [-i, 0]] = -S. Because S is [[0, -i], [i, 0]], so -S is [[0, i], [-i, 0]], which is S†. So S is anti-Hermitian, S† = -S.

Wait, then Ay is c * S, where c = h/(4π). So Ay† = (c S)† = c^* S† = c (-S), assuming c is real. So c is h/(4π), which is real. So Ay† = -c S = -Ay. So Ay is anti-Hermitian. That would mean that Ay is imaginary. So the eigenvalues would be imaginary? Wait, no.

Wait, no, wait. Because if a matrix is anti-Hermitian, then its eigenvalues are purely imaginary. Because for any eigenstate, Ay |φ> = a
