Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure out the right sequence of reagents to get from ethynylcyclohexane to this specific compound: 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. Hmm, that's a mouthful. Let me break it down.

First, I need to understand the target molecule. So the structure is a cyclohexane ring with a substituent. The substituent is a hydroxymethyl group attached to another cyclohexyl group, and also a carbonyl group (since it's a carbaldehyde). Wait, let me draw this mentally. So, the main cyclohexane has a CH2CH(OH)-cyclohexyl group and a CHO group attached. Or maybe it's more like a cyclohexyl group attached to a CH(OH)-CH2- group, which is then attached to the main ring. Hmm, not entirely sure, but I think the key is figuring out the steps to build this.

The starting material is ethynylcyclohexane. That's cyclohexane with a triple bond (ethynyl group) attached. So, it's like two cyclohexane rings connected by a triple bond. Wait, no. Ethynylcyclohexane is cyclohexane with an ethynyl group, which is a -C≡CH group. So the structure is cyclohexane-CH2-C≡CH? Or is it cyclohexane with a -C≡C- group? No, ethynyl is -C≡CH. So the structure is cyclohexane with a CH2-C≡CH substituent.

Wait, maybe I should think about the synthesis steps. What reactions can I do on ethynylcyclohexane?

I remember that when you have an alkyne, like the ethynyl group, you can perform several reactions. For example, alkyne can be hydrogenated, or it can undergo addition reactions. Also, maybe using strong bases like NaNH2 could deprotonate it, but wait, the ethynyl group has acidic protons because of the sp-hybridized carbon.

So, in the options, the first step in all of them is NaNH2 and something. Let me think: if I have ethynylcyclohexane and I treat it with a strong base like NaNH2, which is a strong base, it would deprotonate the ethynyl group. The ethynyl group has protons on the triple bond, so deprotonation would give a cyclohexanide with a -C≡C- group and a negative charge on the adjacent carbon.

Wait, but NaNH2 is typically used for deprotonation of alkynes. So when you treat ethynylcyclohexane with NaNH2, you get the cyclohexyl lithium? Or maybe it's more like a cyclohexyl acetylide. Because when you deprotonate a terminal alkyne with a strong base like NaNH2, you get an acetylide.

So the first step in the options is NaNH2 plus something else. For example, in option A, it's methyl chloride; option B, ethyl chloride; C, methyl chloride; D, methanol.

Wait,
