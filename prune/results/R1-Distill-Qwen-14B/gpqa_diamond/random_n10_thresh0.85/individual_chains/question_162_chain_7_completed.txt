Okay, so I've got this question about a metric and finding the area of a pseudosphere with radius r=2. Hmm, I remember that a pseudosphere is like a surface of constant negative curvature, right? But wait, the question is about the area of this pseudosphere. I'm a bit confused about where to start.

The metric given is ds² = (32)/(4 - x² - y²) (dx² + dy²). Oh, wait, that looks like it's in two dimensions, so maybe it's the metric for some kind of surface embedded in 3D space or something else. Or perhaps it's a 2D surface with this metric, and I'm supposed to calculate its area.

Wait, the question says it's a pseudosphere of radius r=2. So I think that the metric should be related to the pseudosphere's geometry. But I'm a bit rusty on the exact forms of metrics for pseudospheres or hyperboloids.

Let me think about what a pseudosphere is. A pseudosphere is a surface of constant negative curvature. Its metric can be written in terms of Poincaré coordinates, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the metric is that of a hyperbolic space, like the Poincaré disk model.

Wait a second, in the Poincaré disk model, the metric is usually given as ds² = (4/(1 - x² - y²)^2) (dx² + dy²). That's for the unit disk, right? Because the curvature is -1. But in our case, the metric is 32/(4 - x² - y²) (dx² + dy²). Hmm, comparing the two. Let me see.

Let me factor out the 4 in the denominator. So 4 - x² - y² is 4(1 - (x² + y²)/4). So the denominator becomes 4(1 - (x² + y²)/4), and 32 divided by that is 32/(4(1 - (x² + y²)/4)) )= 8/(1 - (x² + y²)/4).

Wait, so 32/(4 - x² - y²) = 8/(1 - (x² + y²)/4). So the metric is ds² = 8/(1 - (x² + y²)/4) (dx² + dy²).

Compare this to the Poincaré disk model. The general form is ds² = 4/(a² (1 - (x² + y²)/a²)) (dx² + dy²), where a is the radius of the disk, and the curvature is -1/a². Wait, maybe I should double-check that.

Wait, another approach: the Poincaré disk model has a metric ds² = (4/(a² - (x² + y²))) (dx² + dy²), where a is the radius. Wait, but I'm not sure about the exact form. Let me think about the curvature.

In hyperbolic geometry, the Gaussian curvature K is negative. For the Poincaré disk model with radius a, the curvature is K = -1/a². Alternatively, sometimes the curvature is expressed differently, depending on the scaling.

Wait, let's think about the metric given. The denominator is (4 - x² - y²), and the numerator is 32. So, 32/(4 - x² - y²) = 8/(1 - (x² + y²)/4). So if I set a² =4, then 1 - (x² + y²)/a² = 1 - (x² + y²)/(4). So the metric becomes (8) [dx² + dy²] / (1 - (x² + y²)/4).

But in the standard Poincaré disk model, the metric is (4/(a² - x² - y²)) (dx² + dy²). Wait, that would be 4/(4 - x² - y²) for a=2. But our metric here is 32/(4 - x² - y²) (dx² + dy²), which is 8 times larger. So that suggests that the scaling factor is different.

Wait, perhaps the metric can be written as ds² = (2^2 * 8)/(4 - x² - y²) (dx² + dy²). Hmm, maybe not. Alternatively, perhaps it's better to calculate the Gaussian curvature to see.

Wait, the Gaussian curvature K of a metric ds² = E dx² + 2F dx dy + G dy² (in 2D) can be found using the formula involving the Christoffel symbols. But maybe for a metric that's conformally flat, like this one (since it's just a scalar function times dx² + dy²), there's a simpler way.

Yes, for a conformally flat metric ds² = φ²(dx² + dy²), the Gaussian curvature K is given by - (1/(2φ²)) Δ φ, where Δ is the Laplacian. Oh wait, alternatively, I think it's K = - (1/(2φ²)) ∇² φ, where ∇² is the flat Laplacian.

Wait, let me get this right. The formula is K = -(1/(2φ²)) ( (∂² φ/∂x²) + (∂² φ/∂y²) ). Because for a conformal metric ds² = φ² (dx² + dy²), the Gaussian curvature is given by that expression.

So in our case, the metric is ds² = [32/(4 - x² - y²)] (dx² + dy²). So φ² = 32/(4 - x² - y²). So φ = sqrt(32/(4 - x² - y²)).

But perhaps it's easier to compute the curvature by finding the Laplacian of the logarithm of φ. Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think again.

Wait another formula: for a metric ds² = g(x,y) (dx² + dy²), the Gaussian curvature is given by K = - (1/(2 g)) [ ( ∂/∂x (g ∂g/∂x) ) + ( ∂/∂y (g ∂g/∂y) ) ) ].

Wait, I'm not sure about that. Alternatively, perhaps using the formula for the curvature scalar in isothermal coordinates. Because in conformally flat coordinates, the Gaussian curvature is K = - (1/(2 φ²)) ( φ_x² + φ_y² ), where φ is the conformal factor.

Wait, no, wait. Let me correct that. The correct formula is K = - (1/(2 φ²)) ( (φ_{xx} + φ_{yy}) ). Because the Laplacian of φ is φ_xx + φ_yy.

So, let's compute φ, which is sqrt(32/(4 - x² - y²)). Wait, wait, no. The conformal factor is the square root of the coefficient of dx². So, ds² = g (dx² + dy²), where g is 32/(4 - x² - y²). So φ² = g, so φ = sqrt(32/(4 - x² - y²)).

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to compute the Gaussian curvature using the formula for a metric of the form ds² = (f(x,y)) (dx² + dy²). The Gaussian curvature K is then given by:

K = - [ (f_x² + f_y²) / (2 f^2) ) ] + [ (something else? Maybe I'm mixing it up. Alternatively, perhaps I should use the standard formula for the Gaussian curvature in terms of the coefficients.

Wait, maybe it's better to compute directly using the formula for Gaussian curvature when the metric is conformally flat.

The formula is K = - (1/(2 φ²)) ( φ_{xx} + φ_{yy} )

So φ = sqrt(32/(4 - x² - y²)).

Hmm, but let's compute φ. Let me set φ^2 = 32/(4 - (x^2 + y^2)). So, φ = sqrt(32) / sqrt(4 - (x² + y²)).

Wait, sqrt(32) is 4*sqrt(2), because 32=16*2, so sqrt(32)=4*sqrt(2). So, φ = 4√2 / sqrt(4 - r²), where r² = x² + y².

Wait, but I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me compute φ_xx and φ_yy.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to compute the curvature by substituting into the formula K = - (1/(2 φ²)) ( φ_xx + φ_yy )

So first, compute φ. Then compute its second derivatives.

Let me proceed step by step.

φ = sqrt(32/(4 - x² - y²)) = sqrt(32) / sqrt(4 - (x² + y²)) )

Let me compute φ_x:

φ_x = (d/dx) [ sqrt(32) / sqrt(4 - x² - y²) ) ]

= sqrt(32) * (1/2) (4 - x² - y²)^(-3/2) * (2x)

= sqrt(32) * x / (4 - x² - y²)^(3/2)

Similarly, φ_y = sqrt(32) * y / (4 - x² - y²)^(3/2)

Now, compute φ_xx. Let's differentiate φ_x with respect to x.

φ_xx = d/dx [ sqrt(32) x (4 - x² - y²)^(-3/2) ]

= sqrt(32) [ (4 - x² - y²)^(-3/2) + x * (-3/2) (4 - x² - y²)^(-5/2) * (-2x) ) ]

Simplify:

= sqrt(32) [ (4 - x² - y²)^(-3/2) + x * (3x) (4 - x² - y²)^(-5/2) ) ]

= sqrt(32) [ (4 - x² - y²)^(-3/2) + 3x² (4 - x² - y²)^(-5/2) ) ]

Factor out (4 - x² - y²)^(-5/2):

= sqrt(32) * (4 - x² - y²)^(-5/2) [ (4 - x² - y²) + 3x² ]

= sqrt(32) * (4 - x² - y²)^(-5/2) [4 - x² - y² + 3x² ]

Simplify inside the brackets:

4 - y² + 2x².

Similarly, φ_yy would be similar, but with y terms instead.

φ_yy = sqrt(32) * (4 - x² - y²)^(-5/2) [4 - x² - 2y² ]

Now, sum φ_xx + φ_yy:

= sqrt(32) * (4 - x² - y²)^(-5/2) [ (4 - y² + 2x²) + (4 - x² - 2y²) ) ]

Adding the terms inside:

(4 - y² + 2x²) + (4 - x² - 2y²) ) = 8 - 3 y² + x².

Wait, let me compute that again.

Wait, 4 - y² + 2x² + 4 - x² - 2y² = (4+4) + (2x² - x²) + (-y² - 2y²) = 8 + x² - 3 y².

Wait, but wait, that's incorrect. Let me actually add each term:

4 +4 =8.

-y² -2y² = -3 y².

2x² -x² = x².

So sum is 8 + x² -3 y².

But wait, that doesn't seem symmetric. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating φ_xx and φ_yy.

Wait, perhaps I should approach it differently. Let me consider that 4 - x² - y² = R², where R²=4 - r², with r² = x² + y².

Wait, but perhaps an alternative approach. Let me compute φ_xx + φ_yy.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to note that the sum φ_xx + φ_yy would involve derivatives in terms of r, where r² = x² + y².

So, let me consider that u = r² = x² + y².

Then, φ = 4√2 (4 - u)^(-1/2).

Compute dφ/du = 4√2 * (-1/2) (4 - u)^(-3/2) * (-1) )= 4√2 * (1/2) (4 - u)^(-3/2) )= 2√2 (4 - u)^(-3/2).

Then, the Laplacian in 2D for a function that depends only on r is:

Δ φ = φ_rr + (1/r) φ_r.

But wait, since we're in 2D, and φ is a function of r, we can compute the Laplacian as:

Δ φ = (1/r) d/dr (r dφ/dr )

So let's compute that.

First, find dφ/dr.

Wait, since u = r², then du/dr = 2r, and dφ/du = 2√2 (4 - u)^(-3/2).

So dφ/dr = dφ/du * du/dr = 2√2 (4 - u)^(-3/2) * 2 r = 4√2 r (4 - u)^(-3/2).

Then, multiply by r: r * dφ/dr = 4√2 r² (4 - u)^(-3/2).

Now, take the derivative of that with respect to r:

d/dr [4√2 r² (4 - u)^(-3/2) ]

But u = r², so du/dr = 2r.

So,

d/dr [4√2 r² (4 - u)^(-3/2) ] = 4√2 [ 2r (4 - u)^(-3/2) + r² * (-3/2) (4 - u)^(-5/2) (-2r) ) ]

Wait, let me compute each term.

The product rule says derivative of A*B is A’ B + A B’.

Here, A = r², B= (4 - u)^(-3/2).

So, A’ = 2r.

B’ = (-3/2) (4 - u)^(-5/2) * (- du/dr ) = (-3/2) (4 -u)^(-5/2) * (-2r) )= 3 r (4 -u)^(-5/2).

So,

d/dr (A B) = 2r * (4 - u)^(-3/2) ) + r² * 3 r (4 - u)^(-5/2 )

= 2r (4 - u)^(-3/2) + 3 r^3 (4 - u)^(-5/2 )

Factor out (4 - u)^(-5/2) * r:

= r (4 - u)^(-5/2) [ 2 (4 - u) + 3 r² ]

But since u = r²,

= r (4 - u)^(-5/2) [ 2(4 - u) + 3 u ]

= r (4 - u)^(-5/2) [ 8 - 2u + 3u ]

= r (4 - u)^(-5/2) [8 + u ]

So, the Laplacian Δ φ = (1/r) * [4√2 r (4 - u)^(-3/2) ] + derivative of what I just did.

Wait, wait. I think I got mixed up. Let me clarify.

Earlier, I was trying to compute the Laplacian as (1/r) d/dr (r dφ/dr). So,

r dφ/dr = 4√2 r² (4 - u)^(-3/2), as before.

Then, d/dr [r dφ/dr] = 4√2 [2r (4 - u)^(-3/2) + r² * ( derivative of (4 - u)^(-3/2) ) * (du/dr) ) ]

Wait, perhaps this is getting too complicated. Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the Laplacian directly.

Wait, another approach: since the metric is given, perhaps I can compute the Gaussian curvature K using the formula for a 2D metric in conformal form.

The formula I have is K = - (1/(2 φ^2)) [ (φ_x)^2 + (φ_y)^2 ]

Wait, wait, no. Wait, the formula for K in terms of the conformal factor φ is:

K = -(1/(2 φ²)) [ (∂^2 φ/∂x^2) + (∂^2 φ/∂y^2) ) ]

So, it's the Laplacian of φ divided by (2 φ²), multiplied by -1.

Wait, so let me compute the Laplacian of φ. So φ is 4√2 / (4 - r²)^½, where r² = x² + y².

So, φ = 4√2 (4 - r²)^(-1/2).

Compute the Laplacian of φ in 2D.

Laplacian in polar coordinates for a radially symmetric function φ(r) is:

Δ φ = (1/r) d/dr [ r dφ/dr ]

So, let's compute dφ/dr first.

dφ/dr = 4√2 * (-1/2) (4 - r²)^(-3/2) * (-2r) ) )

= 4√2 * (1/2) * 2r (4 - r²)^(-3/2 )

= 4√2 * r (4 - r²)^(-3/2 )

Then, compute (1/r) d/dr [ r dφ/dr ]

= (1/r) d/dr [ r * 4√2 r (4 - r²)^(-3/2) ) ]

= (1/r) d/dr [ 4√2 r² (4 - r²)^(-3/2) ]

Let me compute the derivative inside.

Let me set u =4 - r², so du/dr = -2r.

So,

d/dr [ r² u^{-3/2} ] = 2r u^{-3/2} + r² (-3/2) u^{-5/2} (-2r)

= 2r u^{-3/2} + 3 r^3 u^{-5/2}

So,

= 2r (4 - r²)^(-3/2) + 3 r^3 (4 - r²)^(-5/2 )

Factor out (4 - r²)^(-5/2) * r:

= r (4 - r²)^(-5/2) [ 2(4 - r²) + 3 r^2 ]

= r (4 - r²)^(-5/2) [ 8 - 2 r² + 3 r^2 ]

= r (4 - r²)^(-5/2) [8 + r^2 ]

So, (1/r) times this is:

(1/r) * [ r (4 - r²)^(-5/2) (8 + r^2) ) ] = (4 - r^2)^(-5/2) (8 + r^2 )

So, the Laplacian of φ is (8 + r^2)/(4 - r^2)^{5/2}.

Now, K = -(1/(2 φ^2)) * [ (8 + r²)/(4 - r²)^{5/2} ) ]

But φ^2 is (4√2)^2 / (4 - r^2) ) = 32 / (4 - r^2).

So,

K = -(1/(2 * (32/(4 - r^2)) )) * (8 + r^2)/(4 - r^2)^{5/2} )

Simplify denominator:

= -( (4 - r^2) ) / (64) ) * (8 + r^2)/(4 - r^2)^{5/2} )

Multiply numerator and denominator:

= - ( (4 - r^2) (8 + r^2) ) / (64 (4 - r^2)^{5/2} ) )

Simplify:

(4 - r^2) / (4 - r^2)^{5/2} ) = (4 - r^2)^{ -3/2 }

So,

= - (8 + r^2) / (64 (4 - r^2)^{3/2} ) )

Hmm, but I'm supposed to have a constant curvature. Wait, this seems to be dependent on r, but I expected a constant curvature for a pseudosphere.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Alternatively, perhaps the metric is not that of a pseudosphere but something else.

Wait, another approach: if the metric is of a pseudosphere with radius r=2, then the Gaussian curvature should be negative and constant.

Wait, the Gaussian curvature K of a pseudosphere (which is a surface of revolution) is given by K = -1/a², where a is the radius of curvature. Alternatively, for the Poincaré disk model, the curvature is -1/a², where a is the radius of the disk.

Wait, but in our case, the metric is ds²= (32)/(4 - x² - y²) (dx²+dy²). Let me see what curvature this gives.

Wait, perhaps I can compute K at a particular point, say the origin, where x=y=0.

At (0,0), r=0.

So, plugging r=0, let's compute K.

K = -(1/(2 φ²)) (8 + 0) / (4 - 0)^{5/2} )

But φ² at (0,0) is 32/(4) = 8.

So,

K = -(1/(2 * 8)) * (8) / (4^{5/2}) )

4^{5/2} is (2^2)^{5/2} = 2^5 =32.

So,

K = -(1/(16)) * (8)/(32) ) = -(8)/(16 *32) ) = -(1)/(64).

Wait, that's K= -1/64. So the curvature is negative, which makes sense for a pseudosphere.

But K is negative and constant, right? Because for a pseudosphere, the curvature is constant.

Wait, but my calculation gave K as a function of r. So why is that?

Ah! Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in assuming that the metric is a pseudosphere. Because the calculation shows that the curvature depends on r, which would imply it's not a constant curvature. But the question states it's a pseudosphere of radius r=2. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Alternatively, perhaps the given metric is that of a pseudosphere with radius 2. Let me think about the pseudosphere's metric.

Wait, perhaps I should recall that the metric of a pseudosphere (tractricoid) can be written in terms of its parametrization.

Alternatively, the metric for a pseudosphere with radius a is given by:

ds² = a² (dx² + dy²) / ( cosh²(r/a) ), where r is the radial coordinate. Wait, I'm not sure about this. Alternatively, perhaps I should think about the parametrization in terms of the tractrix.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the metric of a pseudosphere in the Poincaré disk model. So the Poincaré disk model for hyperbolic plane has a metric:

ds² = (4 dx² + 4 dy²) / (1 - (x² + y²))^2.

Wait, but in our case, the metric is (32)/(4 - x² - y²) (dx² + dy²). So it's similar but with a different denominator and scaling.

Wait, let me factor 4 out of the denominator:

4 - x² - y² = 4(1 - (x² + y²)/4 )

So, 32/(4 - x² - y²) = 8/(1 - (x² + y²)/4 )

So, ds² = [8/(1 - (x² + y²)/4 ) ] (dx² + dy²).

Compare this to the standard Poincaré disk model, which is ds² = [4/(1 - x² - y²)] (dx² + dy²).

Wait, so our metric is similar, but scaled. Let me see: the standard Poincaré disk has curvature K = -1. What scaling would lead to a different curvature?

Wait, the curvature is inversely proportional to the square of the radius. So if the standard Poincaré disk has radius a=1, curvature K=-1. If I scale the coordinates by a factor, say a, then the curvature becomes K = -1/(a^2).

So, in our case, the denominator is (1 - (x² + y²)/4 ), which is like scaling x and y by a factor of 2. So the radius a=2.

So, the curvature would be K = -1/(2^2) = -1/4.

But earlier when I computed K at the origin, I got K= -1/64. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation earlier.

Wait, let me recalculate K at the origin.

At (0,0), r=0.

So, K = -(1/(2 φ^2)) * ( (φ_xx + φ_yy) )

But φ^2 = 32/(4) ) = 8, so 1/(2 φ^2) = 1/(16).

φ_xx + φ_yy at (0,0) is (8 + 0) from earlier steps, but wait, earlier when evaluating φ_xx + φ_yy, when r=0,

φ_xx + φ_yy = [8 + r^2 ] / (4 - r^2)^{5/2} ) at r=0 gives 8/(4)^{5/2} = 8/(32) = 1/4.

So,

K = -(1/(16)) * (1/4 ) = -1/(64).

Hmm, but according to the scaling, with a=2, the curvature should be K=-1/(4) = -0.25, but our calculation gives -1/64 ≈ -0.015625. That's a big discrepancy.

So perhaps the given metric is not of a pseudosphere but something else. Wait, but the question says it's a pseudosphere of radius r=2, so perhaps I need to find the area, not the curvature. Hmm.

Wait, the area of a pseudosphere. I remember that the surface area of a pseudosphere is 4π a^2, where a is the radius. Wait, no, that can't be right because a pseudosphere is a surface of infinite extent, right? Or is it compact?

Wait, no, the pseudosphere is a finite area surface. Wait, the tractricoid, which is the pseudosphere, has finite area. Because it's a surface of revolution of the tractrix, which approaches an asymptote. So the area is finite.

Wait, the area of a pseudosphere is 4π a², where a is the radius of curvature. So for a=2, the area would be 4π (2)^2 = 16π.

But looking at the options, option D is +infty, which would be if the area is infinite. So perhaps I'm getting something wrong.

Wait, but wait, the metric given in the question is for a 2D surface. Wait, perhaps it's the metric of a hyperbolic plane, which has infinite area. So the question is what is the area of the pseudosphere with radius r=2.

Wait, no. The pseudosphere is a finite surface. The hyperbolic plane, on the other hand, is an infinite surface. So perhaps the given metric is that of a hyperbolic plane, which would have infinite area. But the question says it's a pseudosphere.

Wait, perhaps the question is a bit ambiguous. Alternatively, perhaps I should think about the given metric and see whether the area is finite or infinite.

The area can be found by integrating over the domain where the metric is defined. The domain is where 4 - x² - y² > 0, which is x² + y² <4. So it's the disk of radius 2 centered at the origin.

So, the area A is the integral over x² + y² <4 of sqrt(g) dx dy, where g is the determinant of the metric. But since the metric is diagonal and conformally flat, sqrt(g) is just sqrt(32/(4 - x² - y²)).

Wait, wait, the area element in 2D for a metric ds² = E dx² + G dy² (if F=0, which it is here) is sqrt(EG - F^2) dx dy. But since E=G=32/(4 - x² - y²), and F=0, the determinant is EG - F^2 = (32/(4 - ...))^2.

Wait, but actually, no. Wait, the area element is sqrt(det g), where det g is EG - F². So in this case, E = G = 32/(4 - x² - y²), and F=0.

So det g = (32/(4 - x² - y²))^2 -0 = (32)^2/(4 - x² - y²)^2.

Then, the area element becomes sqrt( (32)^2 ) / (4 - x² - y² ) ) dx dy.

Which is 32/(4 - x² - y² ) dx dy.

Wait, that's because sqrt( (32)^2/(4 - ... )^2 ) = 32/(4 - ... )

So the area A is the integral over x² + y² <4 of [32/(4 - x² - y² )] dx dy.

Hmm, that's a bit problematic because when r approaches 2 (the boundary), the denominator approaches zero, making the integrand blow up. So the integral might be divergent, leading to an infinite area.

Wait, but the domain is x² + y² <4, which is a finite disk. But the integrand has a singularity at r=2. So we need to check whether the integral converges.

Let me compute the integral in polar coordinates. x² + y² = r², dx dy = r dr dθ.

So,

A = ∫ (θ=0 to 2π) ∫ (r=0 to 2) [32/(4 - r²)] * r dr dθ.

So,

A = 32 * 2π ∫ (r=0 to 2) [ r / (4 - r²) ] dr.

Let me compute the integral ∫ [ r/(4 - r²) ] dr from 0 to 2.

Let u =4 - r² → du = -2r dr → (-1/2) du = r dr.

So the integral becomes ∫ [ (-1/2) du ] / u from u=4 (r=0) to u=0 (r=2).

Which is (-1/2) ∫ (from 4 to 0) (1/u) du )= (-1/2) [ ln u from 4 to 0 ].

= (-1/2) [ ln 0 - ln4 ].

But ln 0 is negative infinity. So the integral becomes (-1/2)( -infty - ln4 ) → which is positive infinity.

So the integral diverges. Therefore, the area is infinite.

Looking back at the options, option D is +infty.

So the area of the pseudosphere? Wait, but a pseudosphere has finite area. So perhaps the given metric is not a pseudosphere but a hyperbolic plane, which would have infinite area.

Wait, so the confusion is whether the given metric represents a pseudosphere or a hyperbolic plane.

Wait, a pseudosphere is a finite area surface, while the hyperbolic plane is infinite. So if the area is infinite, as per the calculation, it would be option D.

So the answer should be D) +infty.


The problem involves calculating the area of a pseudosphere with radius \( r = 2 \), given the metric:

\[
ds^2 = \frac{32}{4 - x^2 - y^2} \left(dx^2 + dy^2\right).
\]

### Key Observations:
1. **Metric Analysis**: The metric is conformally flat, meaning it can be written as \( ds^2 = \phi^2 (dx^2 + dy^2) \), where \( \phi^2 = \frac{32}{4 - x^2 - y^2} \). This form suggests a hyperbolic-like geometry, but the question specifies it as a pseudosphere.

2. **Pseudosphere vs. Hyperbolic Plane**: A pseudosphere is a finite-area surface of constant negative curvature, while the hyperbolic plane has infinite area. The given metric appears to describe the hyperbolic plane, as it extends over the entire disk \( x^2 + y^2 < 4 \), rather than being compact like a pseudosphere.

3. **Area Calculation**: The area of a 2D surface with metric \( ds^2 = g(dx^2 + dy^2) \) is given by:
   \[
   A = \int \sqrt{\det g} \, dx \, dy.
   \]
   For this metric, \( \det g = \left(\frac{32}{4 - x^2 - y^2}\right)^2 \), so the area element becomes:
   \[
   dA = \frac{32}{4 - x^2 - y^2} \, dx \, dy.
   \]

4. **Integration in Polar Coordinates**: Switching to polar coordinates (\( x^2 + y^2 = r^2 \), \( dx \, dy = r \, dr \, d\theta \)), the area becomes:
   \[
   A = \int_0^{2\pi} \int_0^2 \frac{32}{4 - r^2} r \, dr \, d\theta.
   \]
   Simplifying:
   \[
   A = 32 \cdot 2\pi \int_0^2 \frac{r}{4 - r^2} \, dr.
   \]

5. **Divergence of the Integral**: The integral \( \int_0^2 \frac{r}{4 - r^2} \, dr \) diverges because the denominator approaches zero as \( r \to 2 \). This indicates that the area is infinite.

### Conclusion:
The given metric describes a surface with infinite area, consistent with the hyperbolic plane rather than a pseudosphere. Since the question specifies a pseudosphere, the result contradicts the expectation of finite area, leading to the conclusion that the area is infinite.
