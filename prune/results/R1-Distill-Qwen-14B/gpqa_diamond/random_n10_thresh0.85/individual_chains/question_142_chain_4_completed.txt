Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The density matrix given is ρ = (1/2)(|0><0| + |1><1|). I remember that a density matrix represents the state of a quantum system, especially when it's in a mixed state. But wait, sometimes if it's a pure state, it can also be represented that way. Hmm.

I think I should first write out what this density matrix looks like in matrix form. The basis states are |0> and |1>, so let's write the matrices for each term.

|0><0| is a 2x2 matrix where the (1,1) element is 1, and everything else is 0. Similarly, |1><1| has 1 in the (2,2) position. So when I add these two matrices together, each diagonal element becomes 1, and the off-diagonal elements are zero. Then I multiply by 1/2, so each diagonal element becomes 1/2.

So the density matrix ρ is:
[ [1/2, 0],
  [0, 1/2] ]

I remember that for a qubit, the density matrix can be represented in the Bloch sphere representation. The Bloch vector r has components (x, y, z), and the density matrix is related to the Pauli matrices. Oh right, the general form is ρ = (I + r·σ)/2, where σ are the Pauli matrices and I is the identity matrix.

Let me write that expansion. The identity matrix I for 2x2 is:
[ [1, 0],
  [0, 1] ]

The Pauli matrices are:
σ_x = [[0,1],[1,0]]
σ_y = [[0,-i],[i,0]]
σ_z = [[1,0],[0,-1]]

So when we have r·σ, it's r_x σ_x + r_y σ_y + r_z σ_z. Then adding I gives:
I + r·σ = [ [1 + r_z, r_x - i r_y ],
            [r_x + i r_y, 1 - r_z ] ]

Dividing by 2, we get ρ as:
ρ = (I + r·σ)/2 = [ [ (1 + r_z)/2 , (r_x - i r_y)/2 ],
                   [ (r_x + i r_y)/2 , (1 - r_z)/2 ] ]

Now, comparing this to the given ρ matrix, which is:
[ [1/2, 0],
  [0, 1/2] ]

So let's set the elements equal. The (1,2) element in ρ is (r_x - i r_y)/2, which in our case is 0. That means (r_x - i r_y)/2 = 0 → r_x - i r_y = 0. Hmm, but r_x and r_y are real numbers, right? Because they represent components of the vector. So the only way this can be zero is if r_x = 0 and r_y = 0. Because if r_x = 0 and r_y = 0, then (0 - i*0)/2 = 0. So that gives r_x = 0, r_y =0.

Now looking at the diagonal elements. The (1,1) element is (1 + r_z)/2. This equals 1/2, so (1 + r_z)/2 = 1/2 → 1 + r_z = 1 → r_z =0.

Wait, so r_x=0, r_y=0, r_z=0. So the Bloch vector r is (0,0,0). That would correspond to the completely mixed state, right? Because the density matrix is (I + 0)/2 = I/2, which is the maximally mixed state. Like, a completely mixed qubit.

Looking back at the options, option C is r=(0,0,0), so that's the correct answer. The other options don't fit. Option A is (1,1,0), which would give a different density matrix. Option B is (0,0,1), which would be a different state, maybe |0> or |1> but in the density matrix. Wait, no, let me think. If r_z =1, then (1 +1)/2 = 1, so the (1,1) element would be 1, and (1-1)/2 =0. So the matrix would be [[1,0],[0,0]], which is |0><0|. But our ρ is diagonal with 1/2 in both, so that's not the case.

So yeah, the answer must be option C.


The given density matrix is:

\[
\rho = \frac{1}{2} \left( \left|0\right\rangle \left\langle 0\right| + \left|1\right\rangle \left\langle 1\right| \right).
\]

In matrix form, this is:

\[
\rho = \begin{bmatrix}
\frac{1}{2} & 0 \\
0 & \frac{1}{2}
\end{bmatrix}.
\]

This represents a maximally mixed state for a qubit. To determine its geometrical position in the qubit space, we use the Bloch sphere representation. The Bloch vector \( \mathbf{r} = (r_x, r_y, r_z) \) is related to the density matrix by:

\[
\rho = \frac{1}{2} \left( I + \mathbf{r} \cdot \boldsymbol{\sigma} \right),
\]

where \( I \) is the identity matrix and \( \boldsymbol{\sigma} \) represents the Pauli matrices. Expanding this, the elements of \( \rho \) are:

\[
\rho = \begin{bmatrix}
\frac{1 + r_z}{2} & \frac{r_x - i r_y}{2} \\
\frac{r_x + i r_y}{2} & \frac{1 - r_z}{2}
\end{bmatrix}.
\]

Comparing this with the given \( \rho \), we see that the diagonal elements are \( \frac{1}{2} \), which implies \( r_z = 0 \). Additionally, the off-diagonal elements are zero, which implies \( r_x = 0 \) and \( r_y = 0 \). Therefore, the Bloch vector is \( \mathbf{r} = (0, 0, 0) \), corresponding to the maximally mixed state.

Analyzing the options:
- **Option A** (\( r = (1, 1, 0) \)) and **Option D** (\( r = (1, 1, 1) \)) do not match the given density matrix.
- **Option B** (\( r = (0, 0, 1) \)) corresponds to a pure state \( |0\rangle \langle 0| \), which is not the case here.
- **Option C** (\( r = (0, 0, 0) \)) correctly represents the maximally mixed state.

Thus, the correct answer is:

**Answer: C**
