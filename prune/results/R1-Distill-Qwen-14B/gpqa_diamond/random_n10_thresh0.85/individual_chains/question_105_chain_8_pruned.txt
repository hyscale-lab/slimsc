Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm supposed to figure it out step by step. Let's see what it's about. Hmm, it's about stars with dark spots and how that affects the brightness measurements, similar to an exoplanet transit. Interesting.

Alright, the question says that the star has a radius equal to the Sun's. So R_star is like R_sun. The star has dark spots on one hemisphere, covering 20% of it. The star's effective temperature is 6000K, and the spots are cooler by 1000K, so they're at 5000K. Because the star is rotating, the spots come into and out of view, causing brightness variations. But the question is, if instead of spots, there was an exoplanet transiting the star, what would the planet's radius have to be to produce the same change in brightness?

Wait, the amplitude of the brightness variation is what's important. So the key is to find the same change in brightness (the same signal) in the light curve whether it's due to spots or a planet.

I remember that when a planet transits a star, the dip in brightness is proportional to (R_planet / R_star)^2. So the area blocked is (R_p/R_s)^2.

But in the case of the star spots, the brightness variation is due to the spots rotating in and out of view. So when the spots are on the side facing us, the star appears dimmer, and when they're on the other side, it's brighter again.

Wait, but the spot's effect is a bit more complicated. Because the spots are cooler, the star's total brightness when the spots are visible is lower. The brightness variation depends on the area of the spots and the temperature difference.

So the approach is to compute the fractional change in brightness caused by the spots and then find what planet radius would cause the same fractional change.

First, let's compute the change due to the spots.

The star's total luminosity without spots is L = 4πR_star² σ T_eff^4.

When spots are present, the total luminosity is L = L0 - L_spots + L_unspotted.

Wait, actually, the star's surface has some parts at T_eff and some at T_spot. The filling factor is the fraction of the surface covered by spots.

Filling factor, f = 0.2. So 20% of the surface is spots.

Each spot has a temperature T_spot = 5000K. The rest is at T_eff = 6000K.

So the total luminosity when the spots are visible is:

L = (1-f) * σ T_eff^4 * Area + f * σ T_spot^4 * Area

Wait, the area is the same for each part, so L = (1-f)*T_eff^4 + f*T_spot^4 multiplied by 4πR²σ.

Wait, I can ignore the 4πR²σ factors since we're dealing with relative changes.

So, the fractional change in brightness would be the difference between the maximum and minimum luminosity observed. But wait, when the spots are on the near side, the brightness is lower. And when the spots are on the far side, the brightness is higher than when all the spots are on the far side. Hmm, no, wait, actually, the star's brightness would vary as the spots rotate into and out of view.

Wait, the star is observed as it rotates. Since the spots are on one hemisphere, as the star spins, the spots will come into and go out of view. The maximum brightness occurs when the spots are on the far side (so least area blocked), and the minimum when the spots are on the near side (more area blocked).

Wait, but the question says that the spots are on one hemisphere. So when the spot hemisphere is facing us, we see all the spots. When it's facing away, we don't see any spots. So the brightness variation would range from when the spots are on the near side (minimum brightness) to when they're on the far side (maximum brightness). So the amplitude of the brightness variation is the difference between these two.

So let me compute the average brightness when the spots are on the near side and when they're on the far side.

When the spots are visible (facing us, so hemisphere is near), the brightness is:

L_min = (1-f)*T_eff^4 + f*T_spot^4.

When the spots are on the far side (not visible), the brightness is:

L_max = T_eff^4, because all the surface is at T_eff.

Wait, no. Wait, the spots are on the far side, so all the star's surface not covered by spots is at T_eff, and the spots are on the far side, so their temperature doesn't affect our observation. Thus, the star's brightness when the spots are on the far side is simply L_max = L0, because all the surface is at T_eff.

Wait, no, that can't be right. Because the star's surface is being viewed, and the spots are on the same side. Wait, no, the filling factor is 20% for the entire star, but when the star rotates, the spots come into view. So when the spot hemisphere is facing us, the spots are 20% of the star's surface. So the brightness is lower, and when the other hemisphere is facing us (without any spots), brightness is higher.

Wait, the star has a radius equal to the Sun's. So the surface area is 4πR². But when you have a hemisphere covered, that's 2πR². But the problem says that the filling factor is 20% of the star's surface. So the area of spots is 0.2 * 4πR² = 0.8πR².

Wait, but the question says one hemisphere is covered. Wait, a hemisphere is half the sphere, so 2πR². But the filling factor is 20% of the entire star's surface. So 20% of 4πR² is 0.8πR². So the spot area is 0.8πR². So the spot coverage is less than a hemisphere. So when the star rotates, the spots come into and out of view as the star spins.

So when the spot region is facing us, 20% of the surface is spots at a lower temperature. So the flux is lower, and when the spot region is not facing us, the entire star's surface is at T_eff, so flux is higher.

Wait, no
