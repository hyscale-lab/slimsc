Okay, so I've got this question about neutrinos from the Sun, and I need to figure out the ratio of flux between two energy bands. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my solar neutrino physics, but let me try to think this through.

So the question says that the pp-III branch suddenly stopped about 8.5 minutes ago. Wait, what does that mean? I remember that the pp chain is a series of reactions in the Sun's core that produce energy. I think the pp-I, II, and III branches are different pathways in this chain. Oh right, the pp-III branch produces higher energy neutrinos compared to the others. Or wait, maybe I got that wrong. Let me recall: the main proton-proton chain, pp-I, produces two positrons and a helium-4. The pp-II branch might involve boron or something, but I'm not sure. Oh wait, pp-III is a branch where a proton captures a helium-3 nucleus to form a carbon-12, right? And that process emits higher-energy neutrinos because of the higher binding energy differences involved. So the neutrinos from pp-III are higher in energy compared to the main pp-I reactions.

So if the pp-III branch stops, what happens to the neutrino flux? Well, the majority of the Sun's neutrinos come from the pp-I branch. But the pp-III branch contributes a smaller fraction but at higher energies. So if pp-III stops, the flux at higher energies (like 800-900 keV) would decrease, while the lower energies (700-800) might be less affected since they're from other branches.

Wait, but the question is about the ratio of flux between two bands: 700-800 (band 1) and 800-900 (band 2). So if pp-III is stopped, the higher-energy band (band 2) would have less neutrinos, and band 1 might stay about the same or maybe also decrease if it's part of pp-III. But I think band 1 is around 700-800, which is lower than the typical pp-III neutrino energies. Let me think: the main pp-I process produces neutrinos with energies around 200-400 keV, I believe. The pp-III branch produces higher, maybe around 400-800 or so? Or maybe up to 1000 keV. Wait, I might be mixing things up.

Alternatively, I remember that the dominant solar neutrino flux comes from the pp-I branch, which is around 200-300 keV, and a smaller fraction from the pp-III branch, which produces higher energy neutrinos (like 500-800 keV or so). So if the pp-III branch stops, the flux in higher energy bands would drop.

So if band 1 is 700-800 and band 2 is 800-900, then before the pp-III stopped, band 1 might have had some contribution from pp-III. But if the pp-III stopped, then band 1's flux might decrease, but band 2's flux would drop more, since band 2 is higher than band 1. Wait, no, because band 1 ends at 800, and band 2 starts at 800. So if pp-III neutrinos are around 700-800, then stopping pp-III would reduce the flux in band 1 more than band 2. But I'm not certain about the energy ranges.

Alternatively, perhaps the pp-III neutrinos are in the range of about 500-800 keV. So if the pp-III stops, the 700-800 band (band 1) would have a significant decrease, but the 800-900 band (band 2) wouldn't be affected as much because that's higher than the pp-III neutrinos.

Wait, but the main pp-I neutrinos are lower energy, so band 1 and 2 would be higher than that. So after the pp-III stops, the flux in band 1 (700-800) would be lower because some of those neutrinos were coming from pp-III. Similarly, band 2 (800-900) would have even lessâ€”wait, no, because pp-III neutrinos don't go up to 900. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe the flux in band 2 (800-900) was already lower, but the pp-III contributed only to band 1. So without pp-III, band 1's flux drops by more than band 2's. So the ratio (band1 / band2) would decrease.

Wait, but before the pp-III stopped, the flux in band 1 had contributions from both pp-III and perhaps other processes. Maybe the pp-III neutrinos are around 500-700 keV? Not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the pp-III neutrinos are the main contributors to higher energy bands, like 700-800 and above.

Let me try to think about the solar neutrino spectrum. The main pp-I process neutrinos are around 200-300 keV. The pp-III branch, which is a branch in the proton-proton chain that involves the fusion of two helium-3 nuclei, emits higher energy neutrinos. These would be higher, maybe up to a few hundred keV, perhaps around 400-800 keV. So if the pp-III branch stops, then the neutrinos from that process won't be emitted anymore.

So the neutrinos from pp-III are in higher energies. So if we stop pp-III, the flux in band 1 (700-800) would drop, but band 2 (800-900) is even higher. But wait, maybe the pp-III neutrinos only go up to around 800. So band 2 is 800-900, which might not have had much contribution from pp-III anyway. So after stopping pp-III, band 1's flux would drop a lot, while band 2's might drop less or even stay the same.

Wait, but without pp-III, what else contributes to band 2? Perhaps other processes, but I don't think the main pp-I produces that high. So maybe band 2's flux is very low to begin with, so if pp-III is stopped, the flux in band 2 would drop, but since it was already low, the ratio might not be too bad.

Alternatively, perhaps the pp
