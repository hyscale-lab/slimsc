Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm trying to figure out how to approach it. Let me read through the question again carefully.

The question is about a diatomic molecule made up of elements X and Y. The model used here is the quantum rotation-vibration model, or non-rigid rotor model. The molecule is in its fundamental state, and we need to determine the momentum of a photon it absorbs to switch to the next lowest energy state.

The given data are: mass of X is 20 amu, mass of Y is 2 amu, bond length R is 2 angstroms, and angular frequency w is 4e14 rad/s. The options are four different momenta.

Hmm, so I remember that in molecular spectroscopy, transitions can occur between rotational and vibrational energy levels. The fundamental state is the lowest energy state, so the next state would be the first excited state. But wait, in the non-rigid rotor model, the vibrational and rotational energies are considered together. So the molecule can change its vibrational state or rotational state, or both when absorbing a photon.

Wait, but the question says "switch to the next state with the lowest possible energy." That suggests it's looking for the lowest energy transition possible. So the photon would cause the molecule to go from the ground state (v=0, J=0 perhaps) to the next possible state, which might be either a vibrational or rotational transition.

Wait, but I think the quantum rotation-vibration model combines both rotational and vibrational energy levels. So the energy levels are quantized in terms of both vibration and rotation. The fundamental state is the lowest vibrational state, v=0, and the lowest rotational state, J=0. So when it absorbs a photon, it will transition to the next higher energy state, which could involve either a vibrational or rotational change.

Wait, no, the next state with the lowest energy would probably be the first excited vibrational state, because that requires a much higher energy than a rotational transition. Or is it the other way around? Wait, vibrational energy levels are quantized as (n + 1/2) ħω, where ω is the angular frequency. The spacing between vibrational levels is ħω. For a diatomic molecule, the rotational energy levels are quantized as (J(J+1)ħ²)/(2I), where I is the moment of inertia.

So the energy difference between the ground rotational state (J=0) and the next rotational state (J=1) is ΔE_rot = [ (1*(1+1) - 0*(0+1) ) * ħ² ] / (2I) ) = (2 ħ²)/(2I) )= ħ²/(I).

If the molecule is in the fundamental state (v=0, J=0), the next higher energy state would be either v=1, J=0 or v=0, J=1. Which of these requires a lower photon energy? Because the photon's energy must match the energy difference.

Wait, no. The transition must be such that the molecule goes to the next state with the lowest possible energy. So the smallest possible ΔE would correspond to the photon having the momentum (since E=hf, and p=hf/c, so p is E/c).

So first, calculate the energy required for the fundamental vibrational transition (v=0 → v=1) and the energy for the first rotational transition (J=0 → J=1), then see which is lower.

Let me compute both.

First, the vibrational energy difference. The energy levels for vibration are:

E_v = (v + 1/2) ħω

So the difference between v=0 and v=1 is ΔE_vibr = ħω.

Given ω = 4e14 rad/s, so ΔE_vibr = ħ * 4e14.

ħ is approximately 1.0545718e-34 J·s.

So ΔE_vibr = 1.05457e-34 * 4e14 = 4.218e-20 J.

Wait, but let me think: the energy of a photon is E = hf, and since f = ω/(2π), then E = (ħω)/2π * ω? Wait, no. Wait, E_photon = ħω_photon. So the photon's energy must match the energy difference.

Wait, no, the energy of the photon is ħω_p, where ω_p is the photon's angular frequency. For the vibrational transition, the photon's energy must be ħω_vib, which is ΔE_vibr.

Now the rotational transition: J=0 to J=1.

The rotational energy levels are E_J = (J(J+1) ħ² )/( 2 I )

So the energy difference ΔE_rot is E_1 - E_0 = [ (1*2) - 0 ] * ħ²/(2I ) = (2 ħ²)/(2 I ) = ħ²/(I )

So I need the moment of inertia I. I is μ R², where μ is the reduced mass, and R is the bond length.

Reduced mass μ = (Mx * My) / (Mx + My) ) 

Mx is 20 amu, My is 2 amu. So μ = (20*2)/(20+2) = 40/22 ≈ 1.818 amu. Wait, 40/22 is 20/11 ≈ 1.818... amu.

But I need to convert amu to kg. 1 amu is approximately 1.
