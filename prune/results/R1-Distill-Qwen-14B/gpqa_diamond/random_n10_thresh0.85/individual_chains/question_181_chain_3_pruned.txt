Okay, so I have this question about neutrinos from the Sun and what happens when a certain branch of reactions stops. Hmm, let me try to think it through.

First, the question says that the pp-III branch in the Sun's core suddenly stopped about 8.5 minutes ago. Wait, why 8.5 minutes? Oh right, that's the approximate time it takes for light (or neutrinos) to travel from the Sun's core to Earth. So if the pp-III reactions stop, the change in neutrino flux would be noticeable here around that time later. But in the question, we're just considering this hypothetical stoppage, so I need to figure out how it affects the neutrino flux we detect.

The question is about the flux ratio between two energy bands: 700-800 keV (band 1) and 800-900 keV (band 2). So flux_band1 / flux_band2 is what we're looking for.

I remember that neutrinos are produced in different processes in the Sun. The main ones are the proton-proton chain, which has different branches. There's the pp-I, pp-II, and pp-III branches. Oh wait, the pp-III branch is one of the later steps in the proton-proton chain. I think pp-III is where two helium-4 nuclei (alpha particles) combine into a beryllium-8 nucleus, which then captures a proton to become carbon-12. But wait, no, I might be mixing up the notation. Let me think: the pp chain starts with protons converting into deuterons, then tritons, and so on. Oh right, the pp-III branch is the part where a beryllium-7 captures a proton to become carbon-8, which then decays into carbon-8 (which I think is actually a typo, maybe meant carbon-12? Wait, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Alternatively, perhaps the pp-III branch is the part where three helium-4 nuclei combine to form carbon-12, but I'm not entirely sure. Maybe I should focus more on the neutrinos' energies.

Neutrinos emitted from different processes have different energies. The dominant solar neutrinos are from the proton-proton chain, specifically the pp-I branch. Wait, no, the pp-I is the initial step where two protons fuse to form deuterium, emitting a positron and a neutrino. The pp-II branch is another step in the chain, perhaps when a deuteron fuses with a proton to form a triton, emitting more neutrinos. The pp-III branch is a later step, perhaps involving higher-energy processes.

Wait, I think the neutrinos from the pp chain are lower energy, like a few hundred keV. The CNO cycle produces higher-energy neutrinos, but I'm not sure. But I remember that the dominant solar neutrinos come from the proton-proton chain, particularly the steps where boron-8 decays. Boron-8 is formed via the pp chain and then decays into carbon-8 (but wait, carbon-8 is unstable, so it emits a positron and a neutrino, creating carbon-7, which then decays into nitrogen-7... I'm getting a bit stuck here. Alternatively, maybe the main neutrino emission is from the decay of boron-8 into carbon-8, which then decays into two helium-4 nuclei, emitting a neutrino in the process.

Wait, the key point is that the pp-III branch produces higher-energy neutrinos compared to the earlier steps. So if the pp-III branch suddenly stops, the flux of high-energy neutrinos would decrease, while the lower-energy ones from other branches would remain.

So, neutrino flux is a measure of the number of neutrinos per cmÂ² per second. The flux depends on the production rate of neutrinos from each process.

If the pp-III branch stops, then the production of neutrinos from that branch would stop. So the high-energy neutrinos (from pp-III) would drop, but the lower-energy ones from other branches would continue as before.

In this scenario, the question is about the flux in two specific energy bands. Let's say band 1 is 700-800 keV, and band 2 is 800-900 keV. If pp-III was contributing significantly to the higher energy bands (like 800 keV and above), then stopping it would reduce the flux in band 2. However, the lower band (700-800) might be less affected if pp-III isn't a major contributor there.

Wait, but I need to think about which neutrino processes contribute to which energy bands. The neutrinos from the proton-proton chain (pp-I, pp-II, pp-III) have energies on the order of hundreds of keV. The CNO cycle produces higher-energy neutrinos, but the dominant solar neutrinos are from the pp chain.

So, let's break it down. The main neutrinos from the pp chain are:

- pp-I: produces lower-energy neutrinos, maybe around 100-200 keV.
- pp-II: higher than pp-I, perhaps up to 500 keV.
- pp-III: even higher, perhaps in the range of 500-1000 keV or so.

If the pp-III branch stops, the production of the higher-energy neutrinos (like in the 800-900 keV range) would drop. But the production in the 700-800 keV range might still be dominated by other pp branches, like pp-II.

So, after the pp-III branch stops, the flux in band 2 (800-900 keV) would drop, but the flux in band 1 (700-800 keV) would remain roughly the same, assuming that the pp-II branch is still active and contributes to that band.

Wait, but the question says that only the pp-III branch stopped. So all other reactions continue as before
