Okay, so I have this question about physical theories and regularization at high energies. Hmm, I need to figure out which theory never requires regularization. Let me think about what I know about these topics.

Regularization is a technique used in quantum field theory to deal with divergences, right? Divergences are when calculations give infinite results, which isn't physically meaningful. So regularization is a way to handle those infinities by introducing a cutoff or some other method to make the integrals finite, and then you take the cutoff away in the end. But not all theories need this, maybe?

The question is asking which theory never requires regularization. So I'm looking for a theory that doesn't have these divergences, or perhaps doesn't need to deal with them because it's free or something else.

Looking at the options:

A) Superstring Theory: I remember that string theory is supposed to be a candidate for a theory of everything, including quantum gravity. Regularization is a problem in quantum field theories because of divergences, but string theory is background-independent and maybe doesn't have the same issues. Wait, or does it? I'm a bit fuzzy on that. I think superstring theory does involve dealing with high energies and perhaps doesn't require regularization because it's a different framework, maybe using different methods to handle things.

B) Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD): This is the theory of the strong interaction. It's a non-abelian gauge theory, and I know that gauge theories in general require regularization because of loop divergences. So QCD definitely needs regularization when you calculate things like beta functions or running couplings. So B is out because it does require regularization.

C) Quantum Electrodynamics (QED): QED is the theory of electromagnetism, which is an abelian gauge theory. I remember that QED actually does have divergent loop diagrams. But wait, I think QED is renormalizable. So you can use renormalization techniques, which include regularization. So yes, QED requires regularization. So option C is out too.

D) Classical Electrodynamics: Wait, this is the classical version, not quantum. Classical theories don't have the same issues with divergences in the same way. For example, in classical E&M, you can have things like the infinite charge density at a point charge, but that's handled by the Dirac delta function and doesn't require regularization. Since classical theories don't involve the same divergent integrals that quantum theories do, perhaps they don't need regularization. Or wait, do they ever have any divergences that need handling? I think in classical electromagnetism, things like the self-energy of a charge are problematic, but those are more like infrared divergences. But in terms of regularization techniques, which are part of quantum field theory, classical theories don't require such methods. So D might be the correct answer.

Wait, let me recap. The question is which theory never requires regularization. Regularization is a quantum field theory concept. So any theory that is not a quantum field theory wouldn't require regularization. Or perhaps a theory that doesn't have divergences in the first place.

So looking again, the options are about when regularization is needed. Quantum theories (like QED, QCD, superstring) can require regularization. But classical theories don't because they don't have the same divergences that need to be regularized. So the answer might be D) Classical Electrodynamics.

Wait, but super
