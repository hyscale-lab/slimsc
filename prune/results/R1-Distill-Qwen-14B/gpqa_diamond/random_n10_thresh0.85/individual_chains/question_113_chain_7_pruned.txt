Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the correct chemical formula based on the given spectroscopic data. Let me try to break it down step by step.

First, the question gives me the results from FTIR, 1H NMR, and Mass Spectrometry. I'll need to interpret each of these to piece together what the compound could be.

Starting with the FTIR data. The broad absorption around 3000 cm⁻¹ suggests the presence of either an alcohol (O-H stretch) or maybe a carbonyl group, but wait, no, the carbonyl is usually around 1700. Oh right, a broad peak around 3000 is more likely an O-H group, like in an alcohol or a carboxylic acid. Wait, but the problem here says it's a very broad peak. Carboxylic acids have very broad O-H stretches because they're more acidic and can form hydrogen bonds more extensively. But maybe it's a primary, secondary, or tertiary alcohol. Hmm.

Then there are two other strong peaks at 1700 and 1650 cm⁻¹. The 1700 is a strong indication of a carbonyl group, probably a ketone, aldehyde, or ester. The 1650 cm⁻¹ is a bit lower than a typical carbonyl, so maybe an ester or maybe an aromatic ring with conjugation? Alternatively, it might be an amide, but that's less likely if the options don't include nitrogen. Wait, looking at the options, all are C, H, O compounds. So maybe an ester or a conjugated carbonyl. Ester's carbonyl is around 1700-1750, but I'm not sure. Also, the 1650 could be an aromatic C=C stretch, but that's usually around 1450-1600. Hmm. Wait, maybe it's a conjugated carbonyl group, like a ketone next to an aromatic ring, which can lower the wavenumber. Or perhaps it's an ester with some conjugation.

Moving on to the 1H NMR. It mentions several peaks, including some corresponding to vinyl hydrogens. Vinyl hydrogens are the ones attached to a double bond, like in alkenes. The presence of vinyl hydrogens suggests the compound has a double bond, maybe an alkene. So the structure probably includes an alkene group.

Then there's the Mass Spectrometry part. The fragment peak at m/z=45. Hmm. Common fragments at 45 could be a methyl group attached to something, but wait, 45 is CH3CO+ (acetyl group), which would come from something like an ester or a ketone. Alternatively, it could be a fragment from an aromatic ring if it's a substituted benzene, but I'm not sure. Wait, 45 is also the molecular weight of CH3COOH, but that's a carboxylic acid. But the m/z is the mass of the fragment. So if the parent ion breaks into a fragment with molecular weight 45, what could that be?

Putting this together: the compound has O-H (from FTIR), a carbonyl group (from 1700), and an alkene (from NMR). Also, the Mass Spec has a fragment of 45, which might suggest an acetyl group.

Looking at the options:

Options are:

A) C6H12O2
B) C6H10O
C) C6H10O2
D) C6H12O

So let's consider the possible structures for each.

Option A: C6H12O2. Degree of unsaturation? For C6H12O2: Each degree is a ring or double bond. The formula is C6H12O2.

The general formula for degree of unsaturation is (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. Assuming no X or N, it's (2*6 +2 -12 -0)/2 = (14-12)/2 =1. So one degree of unsaturation. Which could be a ring and a double bond, or a double bond and an ester group, etc.

Option B: C6H10O. Formula: (2*6 +2 -10)/2 = (14-10)/2=2. So two degrees: could be a double bond and a ring, or two double bonds.

Option C: C6H10O2. (2*6 +2 -10 -0)/2= (14-10)/2=2. So two degrees. Maybe an ester group (which is a carbonyl and an ether-like linkage), plus a double bond.

Option D: C6H12O. (2*6 +2 -12)/2=(14-12)/2=1. One degree: a ring or a double bond.

Now, back to the data. The NMR shows vinyl hydrogens, so there's at least one double bond. The FTIR shows O-H (so alcohol or acid), and a carbonyl (so maybe ester, ketone, aldehyde, etc.). The MS fragment at 45 is likely an acetyl group (CH3CO+).

So let me think about possible structures.

If the compound has an ester group (which would have a carbonyl and an -O-), then the formula would include O2. So looking at options, A and C have O2.

Wait, the FTIR shows two carbonyl peaks: 1700 and 1650 cm⁻¹. That could be two different carbonyl groups, but that's unusual. More likely, one is a carbonyl (like ester at 1700) and the other is something else. Wait,
