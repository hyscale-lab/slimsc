Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about light moving through a glass that's itself moving. Hmm, let me think. I'm a bit rusty on relativity, but I'll try to break it down.

The question says a light beam is propagating through a glass with index of refraction n. The glass is moving at a constant velocity v in the same direction as the beam and towards the observer. We need to find the speed of light in the glass relative to the lab frame. Oh wait, and c is 1 in this problem, which simplifies things a bit.

Wait, so the glass is moving towards the observer, same direction as the beam. So the beam is moving towards the observer, and the glass is moving towards the observer as well. But wait, the beam is in the glass, which is moving. So maybe it's a case of relative velocity between the medium and the observer.

I remember that in classical mechanics, when you have a medium moving at velocity u relative to the lab frame, and a wave in that medium, you can calculate the wave's velocity in the lab frame by adding u to the wave's speed in the medium. But wait, light is a bit different because it's a wave moving at c=1 in vacuum. Wait, no, the speed of light in a medium is v = c/n, right? Because n is the index of refraction.

So in the glass, the speed of light is v_light = c/n = 1/n. But wait, the glass is moving at velocity v. So how does that affect the observed speed?

Wait, but wait a second. In the lab frame, the glass is moving. So the light's velocity in the lab frame would be the velocity of the glass plus the velocity of the light within the glass relative to the glass. But wait, velocity addition isn't as simple as just adding in relativity, right? Because velocities don't just add like in classical mechanics when they get close to the speed of light.

But wait, the speed of light is always c in any inertial frame, right? No, wait, that's in vacuum. Because if the medium is moving, the light's speed relative to the lab isn't necessarily c. Or is it?

Wait, no. When light travels through a medium, its speed is v = c/n. So in the glass, the speed of light is 1/n (since c=1). But the glass itself is moving. So in the lab frame, what's the speed of the light?

Hmm. So the glass is moving at
