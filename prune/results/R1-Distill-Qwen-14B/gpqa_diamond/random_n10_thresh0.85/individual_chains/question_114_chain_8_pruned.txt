Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem to solve, and I'm a bit new to this stuff, but I'll try to think it through. Let me read the question again.

The problem has two reactions, and I need to select the correct reagents (A and B) from the options provided.

First reaction: butan-2-one reacts with NaCN and reagent A to produce 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile.

Second reaction: 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile reacts with reagent B (H2O) to give 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid.

The options are A, B, C, D, each with different combinations of A and B.

Let me tackle each reaction one by one.

Starting with the first reaction. Butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO, which is methylacetone. When ketones react with NaCN, I think it's a nucleophilic addition. Butan-2-one has a carbonyl group, and NaCN provides CN- as a nucleophile. So, the reaction is likely a nucleophilic addition of cyanide to the ketone.

Wait, but how does that lead to 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile? Let me think about the product structure. The product is (CH3)2C(OH)CH2CN? Or wait, the formula given is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile.

Butanenitrile is CH2CH2CH2CN, but with substituents. Wait, butanenitrile would have four carbons, with the nitrile at the end. But the product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile, which I think is (CH3)C(OH)CH2CN. Wait, but butanenitrile is four carbons, so maybe the structure is CH2CH2CH(CH3)CN with the hydroxyl at position 2.

Wait, perhaps it's (CH3)2COHCH2CN? No,
