Okay, so I've got this question about crystallography, and I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to work through it. Let's see what the question is asking.

The question is about a rhombohedral crystal. I remember that rhombohedral crystals have all their edges equal, and all the angles are the same. So in this case, the angles alpha, beta, gamma are all 30 degrees. The interatomic distance, which I think is the lattice parameter a, is 10 Angstroms. The question asks for the interplanar distance of the (111) plane. Hmm, interplanar distance is d, right?

I remember there's a formula for interplanar spacing in crystals. Oh right, it's something like d = a / sqrt( (h² + k² + l²) + 2(hk cos α + hl cos β + kl cos γ) ) ), but wait, no, maybe I'm mixing it up. Alternatively, another formula comes to mind: d = a / sqrt( h² + k² + l² + 2(hk cos γ + hl cos α + kl cos β) ), or something along those lines. Wait, I think the exact formula might involve the Miller indices and the angles between the lattice vectors.

Wait, rhombohedral systems have a special case where all edges are equal and all angles are equal, so maybe the formula simplifies. I think in a rhombohedral system, the formula for d can be written in terms of a and the angles. Let me think.

The general formula for interplanar distance in a crystal is derived from the structure factor and the reciprocal lattice. The interplanar distance d for a plane (hkl) is given by:

d = 1 / sqrt( (h² + k² + l²) + 2(hk (cos α) + hl (cos β) + kl (cos γ)) )

Wait, no, that doesn't seem right. Alternatively, I think the formula is d = a / sqrt( [h² + k² + l²] + 2(hk cos α + hl cos β + kl cos γ) ) ), but I might have the signs mixed up. Wait, the denominator in the formula comes from the reciprocal of the dot product in the reciprocal space. Oh right, the formula is:

d^2 = (a^2)/(h² + k² + l² + 2(hk cos α + hl cos β + kl cos γ))

So, d = a / sqrt( h² + k² + l² + 2(hk cos α + hl cos β + kl cos γ) )

But wait, since in a
