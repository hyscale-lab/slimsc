Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read through it again.

The question is about titrating a diluted acetic acid solution with NaOH. So, the setup is that we take 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid and dilute it with 20.00 cm³ of water. Then, we titrate this with 0.1 M NaOH. We need to find the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point.

Hmm, I think the first step is to find the initial concentration after dilution. Since we're mixing two solutions of equal volume, the concentration should halve. The initial concentration is 0.05 M. So after adding 20 cm³ of water, the volume becomes 40 cm³. So the new concentration is 0.05 / 2 = 0.025 M acetic acid.

Wait, wait, wait. Let me double-check that. The formula is M1V1 = M2V2. So M2 = (M1V1)/(V1 + V2). Since V1 and V2 are both 20 cm³, V1+V2 is 40. So M2 = (0.05 * 20) / 40 = 1 / 40 = 0.025 M. Yeah, that's right.

Next, when titrating with NaOH, which is a strong base, it'll react with the acetic acid. The reaction is: CH3COOH + NaOH → CH3COO-Na+ + H2O.

The equivalence point is when moles of NaOH equal moles of acetic acid. Let's calculate the moles of acetic acid initially. Moles = Molarity × Volume (in liters). So 0.025 M × 0.04 L = 0.001 moles. Then, the moles of NaOH needed at equivalence would be the same, 0.001 moles.

Wait, but the NaOH concentration is 0.1 M. So the volume of NaOH required at equivalence is moles / concentration. So 0.001 mol / 0.1 M = 0.01 L, which is 10 cm³.

But the question is about 25% titration and the equivalence point. So for 25% titration, we're using 25% of that volume, which is 2.5 cm³ of NaOH.

Wait, no. Wait, 25% of the equivalence volume. Since equivalence is 10 cm³, 25% is 2.5 cm³. So at 25% titration, we've added 2.5 cm³ of NaOH.

Let me think about each part.

First, calculate the pH at 25% titration.

At this point, some of the acetic acid has been neutralized by NaOH. Let me find out how much.

Each mole of NaOH neutralizes a mole of acetic acid. The moles of NaOH added at 25% are: 0.1 M × 0.0025 L = 0.00025 mol. So, moles of acetic acid reacted: 0.00025 mol. Since initial moles of acetic acid were 0.001, the remaining is 0.00075 mol.

But wait, when you add NaOH, it's going to produce acetate ions. So the solution is a buffer of acetic acid and acetate. So we can use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation.

Henderson-Hasselbalch equation is pH = pKa + log([A-]/[HA])

So, [A-] is the concentration of acetate, which is 0.00025 mol, and [HA] is 0.00075 mol.

But wait, we have to consider the total volume now. The initial volume is 40 cm³, and we've added 2.5 cm³ of NaOH. So total volume is 42.5 cm³. So concentrations are based on that.

Wait, no. Let me calculate the concentrations properly.

Moles of HA (acetic acid) remaining: 0.001 - 0.00025 = 0.00075 mol.

Moles of A- (acetate) formed: 0.00025 mol.

Total volume is 40 + 2.5 = 42.5 mL, which is 0.0425 L.

So, [HA] = 0.00075 / 0.0425 ≈ 0.017647 M.

[A-] = 0.00025 / 0.0425 ≈ 0.005882 M.

pKa is given by -log(1.85e-5). Let me calculate that.

pKa = log(1/(1.85e-5)) → let me compute it. 1.85e-5 is approximately 1.85 * 1e-5. Log(1.85) is about 0.267, so log(1.85e-5) is 0.267 -5 = -4.733. So pKa is 4.733.

So, pH = 4.733 + log(0.005882 / 0.017647)

Let me compute the ratio: 0.005882 / 0.017647 ≈ 0.3333.

Log(0.3333) is about -0.477.

So pH ≈ 4.733 - 0.477 ≈ 4.256. So approximately 4.26. Hmm, that matches option A where 25% is about 4.26. But wait, let me check the options.

Looking back, option A is 4.26;8.52. Option D is 4.57;6.92. So 4.26 is an option.

Wait, but wait another possibility: Maybe I made a mistake in the calculation of the ratio. Let me recheck.

Wait, HA is 0.00075 mol, and A- is 0.00025 mol. So the ratio [A-]/[HA] is (0.00025)/(0.00075) = 1/3 ≈ 0.333. So log(1/3) is indeed -0.477.

So pH = pKa + (-0.477) = 4.733 - 0.477 ≈4.256, which is 4.26. So 4.26 is the pH at 25% titration.

Now, the second part is the equivalence point. At equivalence, all the acetic acid has been neutralized into acetate. So the solution is a solution of sodium acetate, a salt of a weak acid and strong base.

The concentration of acetate ions will determine the pH. So let's compute that.

At equivalence, we added 10 cm³ of NaOH. So the total volume is 40 +10 = 50 cm³ = 0.05 L.

Moles of acetate (A-) is 0.001 mol, because each mole of acetic acid produces one mole of acetate.

So concentration of A- is 0.001 mol / 0.05 L = 0.02 M.

Since A- is the conjugate base of a weak acid (acetic acid), it will hydrolyze in water:

A- + H2O ↔ HA + OH-

The Kb for A- is Kw / Ka = 1e-14 / (1.85e-5) ≈ 5.405e-10.

So Kb is 5.405e-10. Then, the concentration of OH- can be found using the formula for weak bases.

The formula is sqrt(Kb * C), assuming that x is small compared to initial concentration.

Wait, Kb is 5.405e-10, and concentration is 0.02 M. So Kb * C = (5.405e-10)(0.02) = 1.081e-11. The square root of that is sqrt(1.081e-11) ≈ 3.288e-6 M.

So [OH-] ≈3.288e-6 M. Then, pOH = -log(3.288e-6) ≈5.484.

Since pH + pOH =14, pH is 14 -5.484 =8.516, approximately 8.52.

Wait, but wait again. So at equivalence point, pH is around 8.52. But looking at the options, option A says 4.26 and 8.52. So that's one of the options.

Wait, but option A is 4.26; 8.52.

Wait another moment. Oh wait, I think I might have made a mistake. Because when you have a solution of sodium acetate, you have to consider that the acetate ion is a weak base, so the solution should be basic, so pH>7. But 8.52 seems correct.

But wait, another approach: The hydrolysis reaction of acetate produces OH-.

The Kb is 5.405e-10, which is quite small. So the approximation that x is small compared to initial concentration should be valid. So the calculation
