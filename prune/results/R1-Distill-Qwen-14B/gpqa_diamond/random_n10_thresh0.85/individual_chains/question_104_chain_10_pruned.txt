Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here about exoplanets detected using the radial velocity method. Hmm, let's try to figure this out.

So, the setup is that there are two stars with the same mass, each having a planet with a mass similar to Neptune. Both planets are in circular orbits. The question is about the orbital periods of the two planets based on the observed shifts in the spectral lines.

Wait, from what I remember, the radial velocity method detects the Doppler shift in the star's spectrum as the planet's gravity causes the star to wobble. The shift corresponds to the star's velocity towards or away from us. So, the formula that relates the velocity amplitude (K) to the orbital period must come into play here.

I think the formula involves Kepler's third law. Kepler's law states that the square of the orbital period is proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis, but that's in the context of the star's mass. Oh right, the formula is P² = (4π²/G(M)) * a³, where M is the mass of the star. But wait, in this case, M is the same for both stars since they have the same mass as the Sun.

Wait, but when using the radial velocity method, the observed velocity semi-amplitude K depends on the mass of the planet, the inclination of the orbit (but that's assumed to be edge-on for maximum effect, so maybe 90 degrees, so sin i is 1), and the orbital period. The formula I think is K = (v) = (2π G)^(1/3) * (M_p sin i) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(2/3) * (P^(1/3)) ) )

Wait, but since both M_p are similar to Neptune, and M_star is same as Sun, M_p is much less than M_star, so M_star + M_p ≈ M_star. So the denominator becomes (M_star)^(2/3) * P^(1/3). So K is proportional to (M_p) / (M_star^(2/3) P^(1/3)) ), but wait, no, let me get the formula right.

Alternatively, I've heard that the velocity semi-amplitude K can be approximated as K ≈ ( (G * M_p * sin i) / ( (M_star + M_p) ) )^(1/3) ) * (1 / (2π)) ) * (1 / ( (1 - e²)^(1/2) )) ) * (2π / P )

Wait, maybe I should look up the exact formula. Oh wait, I can't, but I think the important part is that K is inversely proportional to the cube root of the period, assuming other parameters are fixed.

Wait, the formula I remember is:

K = (27 * π * G)^(1/3) * (M_p sin i) / ( (M_star)^(2/3) (1 + M_p/M_star)^(1/3) ) ) * (1 / P^(1/3) ) )

But given that M_p is much smaller than M_star, the denominator's (1 + M_p/M_star) can be approximated as 1, so K ≈ (something) * (M_p) / (M_star^(2/3) ) * (1/P^(1/3)) )

Wait, perhaps the key here is that K is proportional to (M_p) / ( P^(1/3) )

But because M_p is the same for both planets (same mass as Neptune), the ratio of K1 to K2 would be proportional to 1/(P1^(1/3)) ) divided by 1/(P2^(1/3)) ), which is (P2/P1)^(1/3)

So, K1/K2 = (P2/P1)^(1/3) * (M_p2 / M_p1)

But since M_p1 = M_p2, the ratio becomes (P2/P1)^(1/3) = K1/K2

Wait, no, let me think again. The formula for K is:

K = ( (G * (M_p) ) / ( (M_star + M_p)
