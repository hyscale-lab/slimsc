Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here about exoplanets and the radial velocity method. Hmm, I remember that the radial velocity (RV) method detects planets by measuring shifts in the star's spectrum caused by the planet's gravitational pull. The shift is periodic and depends on the planet's mass and the length of the orbit.

The question says that two stars have the same mass as the Sun, and each has a planet with a mass similar to Neptune. Both planets are in circular orbits. The RV method detected the first planet with a shift of 5 milliangstroms, and the second with a shift of 7 milliangstroms. The question is asking how many times longer the orbital period of planet #2 is compared to planet #1.

Wait, I think the RV method measures the Doppler shift, right? The size of the shift depends on the mass of the planet and the star's velocity due to the planet's orbit. The formula for the velocity semi-amplitude K is given by:

K = [ (G * (M_p^3 sin i) ) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(2/3) * (1 - e^2) ) ) ]^(1/3) * (1 / sqrt(1 + M_p/M_star)) 

But wait, since the planet masses are much smaller than the star, M_p << M_star, so M_star + M_p ≈ M_star. Also, the eccentricity e is zero because the orbits are circular. So sin i is 1 (edge-on orbit, which is the case for maximum RV signal). So the formula simplifies to something like K ≈ ( (G * M_p) / (M_star) )^(1/3) * (1/(P * (1/(2π)))) )^(1/3) ?

Wait, maybe it's better to think about the relation between the semi-amplitude K, the orbital period P, and the mass of the planet. The semi-amplitude K is given by:

K = ( (G * M_p * sin i) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(1/3) * (1 - e^2)^(1/2) ) ) )^(1/3) * (1/( (1 + M_p/M_star)^(1/3) )) )

But since M_p is much less than M_star, we can approximate M_star + M_p ≈ M_star, and 1 + M_p/M_star ≈ 1. So sin i is 1 because the planets are detected, so we can ignore inclination (maybe the question assumes edge-on orbits). So K ≈ ( (G * M_p ) / (M_star) )^(1/3) * (1/(P^(1/3))) ) )

Wait, let me think again. Another approach: the RV semi-amplitude K is related to the velocity of the star in its orbit around the barycenter. The formula I remember is:

K = (v * sin i) = ( (2π G ) / (c) )^(1/3) * (M_p sin i) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(2/3) (1 - e^2) ) ) * (1 / (P^(1/3)) )

Wait, maybe I should look for a simpler way. Another thought: The RV method gives us the velocity semi-amplitude K, which is proportional to (M_p / M_star) * (1 / sqrt(a)) ), but wait, maybe that's not the right proportion.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think in terms of the formula that relates K, the orbital period P, and the mass of the planet. I recall that the formula is K = ( ( (G * (M_p) ) / (M_star) )^(1/3) ) * (1/(P^(1/3))) ) ) * (some constant factor like 2π/c )

Wait, perhaps it's better to think about the relation between K and P.

Alternatively, I think that the semi-amplitude K is proportional to (M_p / M_star) * (1 / sqrt(a)), but wait, no, that might be for the transit method. Let me think again.

Wait, another approach: the RV semi-amplitude K is given by:

K = (v * sin i) = [ ( (G * (M_p) ) / ( (M_star + M_p) ) )^(1/3) ) * ( (1) ) / (P^(1/3) * (1 - e^2)^(1/2) ) ) ]

But since M_p << M_star, M_star + M_p ≈ M_star, and e=0 because the orbits are circular. So:

K ≈ [ (G * M_p / M_star )^(1/3) ) ] * (1 / (P^(1/3) ) )

So, K is proportional to (M_p / M_star)^(1/3) / P^(1/3) )

Wait, but wait, M_p is same for both planets because both are Neptune-like. M_p is same, M_star is same because both stars have same mass as the Sun. So M_p and M_star are same for both planets.

So, in that case, K ∝ 1 / P^(1/3) )

Wait, but in the problem, K is given as the shift in wavelength, which is proportional to the velocity. Because the Doppler shift is given by delta lambda / lambda = v / c. So a larger K (higher velocity) would cause a larger shift in the spectral lines.

So, for planet #1, shift is 5 milliangstrom, planet #2 is 7 milliangstrom. So the velocity semi-amplitude is proportional to the shift. So K1/K2 = 5/7.

But from earlier, K is proportional to 1/(P^(1/3)), so:

K1 / K2 = (1/P1^(1/3)) / (1/P2^(1/3)) ) = (P2/P1)^(1/3)

Which would be (5/7) = (P2/P1)^(1/3)

So, (5/7)^3 = P2/P1.

Wait, wait, wait. Wait, K is proportional to 1/(P^(1/3)). So K1 = (1/(P1^(1/3))) * const, K2 = (1/(P2^(1/3))) * const.

So K1 / K2 = (P2 / P1)^(1/3 )

So (5/7) = (P2 / P1)^(1/3 )

So (P2/P1) = (5/7)^3 = (5^3)/(7^3) = 125 / 343 ≈ 0.364.

Wait, but the question asks how many times longer is planet #2's orbital period than planet #1's. So P2 = factor × P1. We found that P2 / P1 ≈ 0.364. So that would make P2 shorter than P1.

Wait, but the ratio is (5/7)^3 ≈ 0.364. So P2 is 0.364 times P1. Which implies that P2 is shorter than P1. So the period of planet #2 is shorter than that of planet #1, so the factor we're looking for is how much longer P2 is than P1, which would be 0.364, but wait, because 0.364 is less than 1, that would mean P2 is shorter.

So the question is: How many times is the orbital period of planet #2 longer than that of planet #1? So if P2 is 0.364 × P1, then it's 0.364 times longer, which is 36.4% of P1's period. So the period of planet #2 is shorter than that of planet #1.

But wait, let me double-check the calculations. Because the shift is higher for planet #2, so its K is higher. So K2 > K1. Since K is proportional to 1/P^(1/3), that implies that if K2 > K1, then P2^(1/3) < P1^(1/3), so P2 < P1. So P2 is shorter than P1. So the period of planet #2 is shorter by a factor of (5/7)^3 = 125/343 ≈ 0.364. So P2 = 0.364 × P1. So the orbital period of planet #2 is 0.364 times that of planet #1, which is about 0.36 times longer. So the answer would be about 0.36, which is option A.

Wait, but let me think again. K is inversely proportional to P^(1/3), so when K increases, P decreases. So higher K means shorter period. So planet #2 has a larger K (7 ma) than planet #1 (5 ma), so planet #2's period is shorter than planet #1's.

Wait, but the calculation earlier was K1/K2 = 5/7 = (P2/P1)^(1/3). So P2/P1 = (5/7)^3 ≈ 0.364. So P2 is 0.364 times P1, so P2 is shorter.

So the question is: How many times longer is P2 than P1? So since P2 is 0.364 × P1, it's 36.4% as long, which is about 0.36 times longer than P1. So the answer would be approximately 0.36, which is option A.


The radial velocity (RV) method detects planets by measuring the Doppler shift in the star's spectrum caused by the gravitational pull of the orbiting planet. The semi-amplitude \( K \), which corresponds to the observed wavelength shift, is proportional to \( \frac{1}{P^{1/3}} \), where \( P \) is the orbital period of the planet. This relationship arises because \( K \) depends on the star's velocity, which is inversely related to the cube root of the orbital period.

In this problem, both planets have similar masses to Neptune, and their host stars have the same mass as the Sun. The RV shifts for the two planets are given as 5 milliangstroms (Planet #1) and 7 milliangstroms (Planet #2). Since the RV shift is proportional to \( \frac{1}{P^{1/3}} \), the ratio of the shifts corresponds to the inverse cube root of the ratio of their orbital periods:

\[
\frac{K_1}{K_2} = \frac{P_2^{1/3}}{P_1^{1/3}}
\]

Substituting \( K_1 = 5 \, \text{milliangstroms} \) and \( K_2 = 7 \, \text{milliangstroms} \):

\[
\frac{5}{7} = \frac{P_2^{1/3}}{P_1^{1/3}}
\]

Cubing both sides:

\[
\left(\frac{5}{7}\right)^3 = \frac{P_2}{P_1}
\]

\[
\frac{125}{343} \approx 0.364
\]

Thus, \( P_2 \approx 0.364 \times P_1 \), meaning the orbital period of Planet #2 is approximately 0.36 times that of Planet #1. Therefore, the orbital period of Planet #2 is **shorter** than that of Planet #1 by a factor of 0.36.

The question asks how many times longer the orbital period of Planet #2 is compared to Planet #1. Since \( P_2 \) is shorter, the factor is less than 1. Based on the calculation, the orbital period of Planet #2 is approximately 0.36 times longer than that of Planet #1.
