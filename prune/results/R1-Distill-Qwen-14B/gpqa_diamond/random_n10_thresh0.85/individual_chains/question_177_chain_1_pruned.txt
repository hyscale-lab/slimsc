Okay, so I'm trying to solve this astronomy problem, and I'm a bit new to this, so I need to think it through carefully. Let's read the question again.

The problem is about two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than Star_2. Also, Star_1's mass is 1.5 times that of Star_2. They observed the wavelengths where the stars appear brightest and found they're the same. So their peak emission wavelengths are the same. Also, their radial velocities are 0 and 700 km/s for Star_1 and Star_2 respectively. The question is about the luminosity ratio of Star_1 to Star_2, assuming black body radiation.

Hmm, okay, so I remember that the luminosity of a star depends on its radius and temperature. The formula is L = 4πR²σT⁴, where σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant. So L is proportional to R squared times T to the fourth power.

But wait, the problem says they're using black body radiation, so that formula should apply. Now, the peak wavelengths are the same. Oh right, because for a black body, the peak wavelength λ_max is given by Wien's Law: λ_max = b / T, where b is Wien's displacement constant (~2.9×10^-3 m·K).

So if λ_max is the same for both stars, their temperatures must be the same. Because λ_max is inversely proportional to temperature. So T1 = T2. Because λ_max1 = λ_max2, so T1 = T2.

Wait, but wait a second. Oh, but the radial velocities are different. Star_1 has radial velocity 0, which might mean it's not moving relative to us, or maybe it's the rest frame. Star_2 has a radial velocity of 700 km/s. Does that affect the observed wavelength? Oh, because of Doppler shift. So the observed wavelength could be different, but the peak emission is from their rest frames.

Wait, but the problem says the wavelengths at which the stars appeared brightest are the same. Hmm. So the observed λ_max is the same for both stars. So for each star, their emitted λ_max in their rest frame would be different, but due to Doppler shift, the observed
