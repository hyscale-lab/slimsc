Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again and try to understand what's going on.

Alright, the question is about exoplanets detected using the Radial Velocity (RV) method. There are two stars, both with the same mass as the Sun, and each has a planet with a mass similar to Neptune. Both planets are in circular orbits.

The RV method detects planets by the Doppler shift in the star's spectral lines caused by the planet's gravitational pull. The star moves a little in response to the planet's orbit. The shift in wavelength (or the periodic change in velocity) is measured, and from that, we can get information about the planet, like its mass and orbital period.

The problem states that for Planet #1, the spectral line shift is up to 5 milliangstroms. For Planet #2, the shift is 7 milliangstroms. The question is asking how many times longer the orbital period of Planet #2 is compared to Planet #1.

Hmm, wait, the orbital period ratio. So we want to find P2 / P1.

I remember that in the RV method, the velocity semi-amplitude (K) is related to the planet's mass and the star's mass. The formula for K is something like K = (v) = (G * (M_planet) / (M_star + M_planet))^(1/3) ) * (1/( (1 - e²)^(1/2) )) ) * ( (2π / P ) )^(1/3) ), but since the orbits are circular, e=0, so that term goes away. Also, since M_planet is much smaller than M_star (Neptune is much less massive than the Sun), M_star + M_planet ≈ M_star. So the formula simplifies a bit.

Wait, but wait, another approach. The RV semi-amplitude K is given by the formula:

K = ( (G * (M_p) ) / ( (M_*)^2 + M_p) ) )^(1/3) ) * ( (2π) / (P * c) ) )^(1/3) )

Wait, maybe I should look for a more straightforward relation. I think for the RV method, the semi-amplitude K is inversely proportional to the square root of the orbital period. Or maybe I'm mixing things up.

Wait, another approach. The RV method gives us the velocity semi-amplitude K, which is the maximum velocity of the star in its orbit. The formula for K is:

K = ( (G * (M_p) ) / ( (M_*) ) ) )^(1/3) ) * ( (2π) / (P * c) ) )^(1/3) )

Wait, no, maybe I should get the correct formula. Let me think again. The formula for the radial velocity semi-amplitude is:

K = [ ( (G * (M_p) ) / ( (M_*)^2 + M_p) ) )^(1/3) ) ] * ( (2π) / P )^(1/3) ) / (c)

Wait, no, perhaps it's better to look up the formula. But I can't do that right now, so I'll try to recall.

The correct formula for the RV semi-amplitude is:

K = ( (G * (M_p) ) / ( (M_*) ) )^(1
