Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The problem states that we have an electron described by the state |alpha>, which is proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>. |up> and |down> are the eigenstates of the z-projection of the spin operator, which I think are the standard spin-up and spin-down states for the z-axis. So, the first thing I need to do is probably normalize this state because it says it's proportional, meaning it's not necessarily normalized yet.

Then, the question asks me to calculate the probability of measuring the particle in each of the eigenstates of a certain operator. The operator has a matrix representation where the diagonal elements Aii are zero, and the off-diagonal elements Aij are hbar/2 when i is not equal to j. So the matrix is a 2x2 matrix with zeros on the diagonal and hbar/2 elsewhere. Hmm, that looks familiar. Oh wait, isn't that similar to the Pauli matrices? Or maybe the operator is something like sigma_x multiplied by hbar/2? Because sigma_x has zeros on the diagonal and ones on the off-diagonal, but sigma_x is (0 1; 1 0). So if our operator A has A_ij = hbar/2 when i≠j, then A is (hbar/2) times the sigma_x matrix. Or wait, sigma_x has 1s off-diagonal and zeros on, but the given matrix here has 0s on the diagonal and (hbar/2) off. So A is (hbar/2) * sigma_x? Because sigma_x would give 1s where A has (hbar/2)s.

Wait, but sigma_x is actually ( [ [0,1],[1,0] ] ), so A would be (hbar/2) times sigma_x. Right. So the operator A is related to sigma_x. That might help because we can find its eigenstates.

The next part of the problem is to find the average value (expectation value) of this operator. So we have two tasks: calculate probabilities of measuring each eigenstate and find the expectation value.

Wait, the operator is A, and we need to find the probability of measuring each eigenstate. So first, I need to find the eigenstates of A, then express |alpha> in terms of those eigenstates, and the coefficients' squared magnitudes will give the probabilities. Alternatively, since A is proportional to sigma_x, perhaps we can use the properties of sigma_x to find its eigenstates.

But let's start by normalizing |alpha>. The given state is |alpha> = (1+i)|up> + (2 -i)|down>. To find the normalization constant, I need to compute the inner product of |alpha> with itself and take the square root.

The inner product is (1+i)(1-i) + (2-i)(2+i), because |up> and |down> are orthonormal. Wait, let me compute that. For the first term, (1+i)(1-i) = 1^2 - (i)^2 = 1 - (-1) = 2. Similarly, (2 - i)(2 + i) = 4 - (i)^2 = 4 - (-1) =5. So the total inner product is 2 +5 =7. So the normalization factor is 1/sqrt(7). Therefore, the normalized |alpha> is (1+i)/sqrt(7) |up> + (2 -i)/sqrt(7) |down>.

Now, the operator A has matrix representation A_ij = hbar/2 if i≠j, else 0. So for a 2x2 matrix, it's [[0, hbar/2], [hbar/2, 0]]. That is exactly (hbar/2) times the Pauli X matrix (sigma_x). So A = (hbar/2) sigma_x.

The eigenstates of sigma_x are the eigenstates of A as well because they're just scaled by a scalar. The eigenstates of sigma_x can be found. The eigenvalues of sigma_x are +1 and -1, so the eigenvalues of A will be (hbar/2)(1) = hbar/2 and (hbar/2)(-1) = -hbar/2.

The eigenstates of sigma_x are the superpositions that are symmetric and antisymmetric under exchange. Specifically, the eigenstates are (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2) for eigenvalue +1, and (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2) for eigenvalue -1. Wait, let me make sure. Because sigma_x is the spin-flip operator. So sigma_x |up> = |down>, and sigma_x |down> = |up>. So the eigenstates should satisfy sigma_x |psi> = ±|psi>. Let me try:

Let |+x> = (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2). Then sigma_x |+x> = (sigma_x |up> + sigma_x |down>)/sqrt(2) ) = (|down> + |up>)/sqrt(2) ) = |+x>, so yes, it's an eigenstate with eigenvalue +1. Similarly, |–x> = (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2) gives eigenvalue -1. So the eigenstates are |+x> and |-x>, as expected.

So, the eigenstates of operator A are |+x> and |-x>, with eigenvalues hbar/2 and -hbar/2, respectively.

Now, we need to express the state |alpha> in terms of |+x> and |-x>, because the coefficients will give the probabilities of measuring each eigenvalue.

Let me write |alpha> as a linear combination of |+x> and |-x>. So:

|alpha> = c_+ |+x> + c_- |–x>.

We can write this as:

c_+ = < +x | alpha >, and c_- = < -x | alpha >.

So let's compute these inner products.

First, |alpha> is (1+i)/sqrt(7) |up> + (2 -i)/sqrt(7) |down>.

|+x> is (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2).

So < +x | alpha > is [ (1+i)/sqrt(7) * <up| + (2 -i)/sqrt(7) * <down| ] * (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2).

The inner product is [ (1+i)/sqrt(7) * 1/sqrt(2) * <up|up> + (1+i)/sqrt(7) * 1/sqrt(2) <up|down> + (2 -i)/sqrt(7) * 1/sqrt(2) <down|up> + (2 -i)/sqrt(7) * 1/sqrt(2) <down|down> ].

But since <up|down> = 0, only the terms where the basis states match survive.

So the expression simplifies to:

[ (1+i)/sqrt(7) * 1/sqrt(2) * 1 ] + [ (2 -i)/sqrt(7) * 1/sqrt(2) * 1 ]

Which is [ (1+i) + (2 - i) ] / sqrt(7 * 2 )

Compute numerator: (1+i + 2 -i) = 3.

So c_+ = 3 / sqrt(14).

Wait, 3 / sqrt(14) is c_+.

Similarly, let's compute c_-, which is < -x | alpha >.

| -x > is (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2).

So < -x | alpha > = [ (1+i)/sqrt(7) <up| + (2 -i)/sqrt(7) <down| ] * (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2).

Again, inner product:

(1+i)/sqrt(7) * 1/sqrt(2) * <up|up> + (1+i)/sqrt(7) * (-1)/sqrt(2) <up|down> + (2 -i)/sqrt(7) * 1/sqrt(2) <down|up> + (2 -i)/sqrt(7) * (-1)/sqrt(2) <down|down>.

Again, cross terms vanish, so:

(1+i)/sqrt(7) * 1/sqrt(2) * 1 + (2 -i)/sqrt(7) * (-1)/sqrt(2) * 1.

So numerator:

(1+i) - (2 -i) = (1 -2) + (i +i) = (-1) + 2i.

Thus, c_- = ( -1 + 2i ) / sqrt(14).

Wait, let me double-check that.

Wait, the terms would be:

(1+i) / sqrt(7*2) ) + (2 -i)* (-1) / sqrt(7*2 )

So numerator is (1+i) - (2 -i) = 1 +i -2 +i = (-1) + 2i.

So c_- = (-1 + 2i) / sqrt(14).

Now, the probability of measuring the eigenstate |+x> is |c_+|^2, and the probability for |-x> is |c_-|^2.

Compute |c_+|^2:

c_+ = 3 / sqrt(14). So |c_+|^2 = 9/14 ≈ 0.642857... So approximately 0.64.

Compute |c_-|^2:

c_- is (-1 + 2i)/sqrt(14). The magnitude squared is [ (-1)^2 + (2)^2 ] /14 = (1 +4)/14 =5/14 ≈ 0.357142... which is approximately 0.36.

Wait, but 9/14 is about 0.642857, which is 0.64, and 5/14 is about 0.3571, which is 0.36. So the probabilities are approximately 64% and 36%, but wait, 5/14 is about 0.357, which is 35.7%, but wait, 9+5=14, so 14 is 1. So that adds to 1, which is correct.

So the probabilities are 9/14 and 5/14. Let me see what 9/14 is as a decimal: 0.642857... which is approximately 0.64. Similarly, 5/14 is approximately 0.357, which is 0.36 when rounded to two decimal places. So the probabilities are 0.64 and 0.36.

Wait, but looking at the options, let's check:

Option A) 0.64, 0.36 and hbar/7.

Option B) 0.54, 0.46 and 3hbar/sqrt(7)

Option C) 0.28, 0.72 and hbar/sqrt(7)

Option D) 0.61, 0.29 and 2 hbar/sqrt(7)

So the probabilities calculated here are 9/14 (~0.64) and 5/14 (~0.36), which matches option A.

But wait, I should also compute the expectation value of the operator A. The expectation value is <alpha| A |alpha>.

But since A is (hbar/2
