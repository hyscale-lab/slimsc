Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem in front of me, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question again carefully.

Alright, so we have a large ensemble of 10,000 identical systems. Each has a particle that's the same and under the same conditions. Each particle moves along a tube, which is the x-axis. The wave function is given as (a / sqrt(1 + x)) minus 0.5i. And when they measured the position, none were found at x less than 1 or greater than 3. So the particles are only found between x=1 and x=3.

The question is asking for the numerical value of 'a'. The options are A) 1.1, B) 0.85, C) 0.35, D) 0.6.

Hmm. I remember that in quantum mechanics, the wave function must be normalized. That means the integral of the absolute square of the wave function over all space must equal 1. Because the particle is only found between x=1 and x=3, the wave function must be zero outside this interval. But wait, the given wave function doesn't seem to be zero outside that range. Wait, no—the question says when measuring, none were found outside, which implies that the wave function is zero outside. So maybe the given wave function is only valid between x=1 and x=3, and zero elsewhere. Or perhaps the given function is the part that's non-zero between 1 and 3.

Wait, the wave function provided is (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i. So that's a complex function. But in quantum mechanics, the probability density is the square of the absolute value of the wave function. So I need to compute the integral of |ψ(x)|² dx from 1 to 3, and set that equal to 1 because the total probability must be 1.

Wait, but the wave function given is (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i. Let me compute the square of the absolute value. The absolute value squared is (a / sqrt(1 + x))^2 + (0.5)^2, because for a complex number z = z_real + z_imag i, |z|^2 is (z_real)^2 + (z_imag)^2.

So ψ(x) = a / sqrt(1+x) - 0.5i. So |ψ(x)|² is (a^2)/(1 + x) + (0.5)^2.

But wait, for the wave function to be normalized, we need the integral from x=1 to x=3 of |ψ(x)|² dx to be 1. But I'm not sure if that's the case. Alternatively, perhaps the given wave function is the correct form, and the region outside x=1 to x=3 is zero.

Wait, but the question says that when measuring, none were found outside 1 and 3. So the wave function must be zero in that region. Does that mean that the given function is zero outside 1 to 3? Or perhaps the function is non-zero only between 1 and 3, and zero elsewhere. Hmm.

Wait, the problem statement says that in a part of space where the particle can exist, the wave function is given as that expression. So I think that implies that the wave function is zero outside of that part of space. So the wave function is non-zero only between x=1 and x=3, and zero elsewhere.

So the total probability is the integral of |ψ(x)|² dx from 1 to 3. And that must equal 1.

So, we can calculate the integral of |ψ(x)|² between 1 and 3, then set it equal to 1 to solve for 'a'.

So let's break it down.

First, ψ(x) = (a / sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i.

So |ψ(x)|² = (a²)/(1+x) + (0.5)^2.

So the integral from x=1 to x=3 is:

∫ [ (a²)/(1+x) + 0.25 ] dx

Let me compute this integral.

First, split the integral into two parts:

Integral (a²/(1+x)) dx from 1 to 3 + Integral (0.25) dx from 1 to 3.

Compute each part separately.

First integral: a² ∫ (1/(1+x)) dx from 1 to 3.

The integral of 1/(1+x) dx is ln(1+x) + C.

Evaluating from 1 to 3:

a² [ ln(4) - ln(2) ] = a² ln(2), since ln(4)=2 ln(2), so 2 ln(2) - ln(2) = ln(2).

Second integral: 0.25 ∫ dx from 1 to 3. Which is 0.25*(3-1) = 0.5.

So the total integral is a² ln(2) + 0.5 = 1.

Because the integral must equal 1 for normalization.

So the equation is:

a² ln(2) + 0.5 = 1.

Subtracting 0.5 from both sides:

a² ln(2) = 0.5.

Solving for a²:

a² = 0.5 / ln(2).

Compute ln(2) which is approximately 0.6931.

So 0.5 / 0.6931 ≈ 0.7213.

Then a = sqrt(0.7213) ≈ 0.849, which is approximately 0.85. Looking at the options, option B is 0.85.

Wait, but wait. Let me double-check the setup.

Wait, the given wave function is (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i. So the real part is a / sqrt(1+x), and the imaginary part is -0.5.

So |ψ|^2 is (a²)/(1+x) + 0.25.

Then the integral from 1 to 3 of (a²)/(1+x) + 0.25 dx = 1.

Yes, that's right. So the calculation above holds.

So a² is approximately 0.7213, a is about 0.849, which is 0.85. So the correct answer is B) 0.85.


To determine the value of \( a \), we use the normalization condition for the wave function. The wave function is given as:

\[
\psi(x) = \frac{a}{\sqrt{1+x}} - 0.5i,
\]

and the particle is restricted to the region \( 1 \leq x \leq 3 \). The normalization condition requires that the total probability is 1, meaning:

\[
\int_{1}^{3} |\psi(x)|^2 dx = 1.
\]

The probability density is the square of the absolute value of the wave function:

\[
|\psi(x)|^2 = \left(\frac{a}{\sqrt{1+x}}\right)^2 + (0.5)^2 = \frac{a^2}{1+x} + 0.25.
\]

The integral becomes:

\[
\int_{1}^{3} \left(\frac{a^2}{1+x} + 0.25\right) dx = 1.
\]

Split the integral into two parts:

1. **First term**: \( a^2 \int_{1}^{3} \frac{1}{1+x} dx \).  
   The integral of \( \frac{1}{1+x} \) is \( \ln(1+x) \). Evaluating from \( x=1 \) to \( x=3 \):

   \[
   a^2 \left[\ln(4) - \ln(2)\right] = a^2 \ln(2).
   \]

2. **Second term**: \( 0.25 \int_{1}^{3} dx \).  
   This evaluates to:

   \[
   0.25 \cdot (3-1) = 0.5.
   \]

Combining both terms, the normalization condition becomes:

\[
a^2 \ln(2) + 0.5 = 1.
\]

Solve for \( a^2 \):

\[
a^2 \ln(2) = 0.5 \quad \Rightarrow \quad a^2 = \frac{0.5}{\ln(2)}.
\]

Using \( \ln(2) \approx 0.6931 \), we find:

\[
a^2 \approx \frac{0.5}{0.6931} \approx 0.7213 \quad \Rightarrow \quad a \approx \sqrt{0.7213} \approx 0.85.
\]

Thus, the value of \( a \) is approximately \( 0.85 \), which corresponds to option **B**.
