Okay, so I've got this question about exoplanets and transit probabilities. Let me try to figure this out step by step. 

So, the setup is that two Earth-like planets, Planet_1 and Planet_2, have been detected using the radial velocity (RV) method. The researchers want to observe the one more likely to transit because they have limited time. 

From what I remember, the transit method relies on the planet passing in front of its star from our perspective, causing a dip in brightness. The probability of a transit depends on the size of the planet relative to the star and the alignment of the orbit. But wait, since the RV method has already detected these planets, we know their minimum masses and orbital periods. Hmm.

The problem gives some data:
- Both planets have the same mass.
- Planet_1's orbital period is three times shorter than Planet_2's. So, Planet_1 is closer to its star (since orbital period is shorter when you're closer, right? Because of Kepler's third law).
- Both have circular orbits, so that simplifies things a bit.
- The host star of Planet_1 has twice the mass of Planet_2's host. But both stars have the same radius. Interesting. So, despite the mass difference, their radii are the same. That might have something to do with the star's evolution, but not sure yet.

Wait, what's the formula for the probability of a transit? I think the transit probability (P) is approximately (R_p / R_s)^2 multiplied by (a / R_s), but wait, no, I think I'm mixing it up. Let me think again.

The transit probability is actually the geometric probability, which is roughly (R_p / R_s)^2 multiplied by (1) if the orbit is edge-on. But wait, no, the geometric probability isn't just that. Wait, the probability is given by the ratio of the planet's orbital distance (a) over the star's radius, but I'm getting confused.

Wait, the actual formula I remember is that the probability is (R_p / R_s)^2 multiplied by (1 / (1 - eÂ²))^(1/2)), but since the orbits are circular (e=0), that part is just 1. So the probability simplifies to (R_p / R_s)^2 * (something else?), no, wait, isn't the transit probability just (R_p / R_s)^2 * (something related to the orbital plane alignment)?

Wait, no, I think I'm getting
