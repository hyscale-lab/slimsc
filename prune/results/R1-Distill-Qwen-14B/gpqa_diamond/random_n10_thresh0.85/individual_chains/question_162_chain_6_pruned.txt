Okay, so I'm trying to solve this question about the area of a pseudosphere given a specific metric. Hmm, I remember that the metric is given in terms of differentials, and the area would involve some integration over the surface. Let me try to break this down.

The metric provided is ds² = [32/(4 - x² - y²)] (dx² + dy²). Wait, that looks a bit like the metric for a surface in two dimensions. Since it's a pseudosphere, I think it's a hyperbolic surface, but I'm not totally sure. Oh right, pseudospheres have constant negative curvature, right? But wait, maybe the metric here is for a sphere or something else.

Wait, the question is about the area of the pseudosphere with radius r=2. I'm a bit confused. Wait, pseudospheres are surfaces of constant negative curvature, similar to a saddle shape. But the options don't seem to directly give an area in terms of r. Wait, perhaps I'm getting ahead of myself.

The metric is given in terms of x and y, but I'm not sure about the coordinates. Maybe it's in polar coordinates? Let me see: the denominator is (4 - x² - y²). If I write x² + y² as r², then the denominator becomes 4 - r². So the metric can be rewritten as ds² = (32)/(4 - r²) (dr² + r² dθ²), assuming polar coordinates with θ and r. But wait, wait—no, originally it's dx² + dy², which in polar is dr² + r² dθ², but if the original metric is in (x,y) flat space, maybe we can proceed.

Wait, but I'm supposed to find the area. The area in a Riemannian manifold is given by the integral of the square root of the determinant of the metric tensor, but wait, in 2D, the area element is sqrt(det g) dr dθ. Or wait, in 2D, the metric in polar coordinates would be written as ds² = g_rr dr² + g_θθ dθ², and the area element is sqrt(g_rr * g_θθ) dr dθ. So let's compute that.

First, the metric in the given form is ds² = [32/(4 - x² - y²)] (dx² + dy²). In polar coordinates, that becomes [32/(4 - r²)] (dr² + r² dθ²). So here, g_rr is 32/(4 - r²), and g_θθ is [32/(4 - r²)] r². The determinant of the metric in 2D is g_rr * g_θθ. So determinant would be (32/(4 - r²))^2 * r². The square root of the determinant is (32/(4 - r²)) * r.

So the area element dA is (32 r)/(4 - r²) dr dθ. Wait, but the limits of integration for r: when r² approaches 4, the denominator approaches zero. So the metric becomes singular at r=2. But what is the range of r? Since the denominator must be non-zero (as it's in the denominator), r² must be less than 4, so r < 2. Because if r² approaches 4 from below, the denominator approaches zero, making the area element blow up. So the surface extends up to r approaching 2, but not beyond.

Wait, but the question is about a pseudosphere of radius r=2. I'm a bit confused. Pseudospheres have a certain radius, but in hyperbolic geometry, the radius relates to curvature. Oh wait, the Gaussian curvature K is negative for a pseudosphere. Wait, but maybe the radius here is similar to the concept of the sphere's radius. So perhaps in this metric, the radius is 2, so the surface is up to r=2.

Wait, if r can go up to 2, then the maximum r is 2. But wait, when r approaches 2, the denominator approaches zero, making the area element go to infinity. That suggests that as r approaches 2, the circumference at that radius becomes infinite, which might not make sense. So maybe the surface is only up to r=2, but the area integral would have a problem there.

Alternatively, perhaps the metric is valid only for r² <4, so r <2, and the surface is a hyperbolic plane or something similar, but it's presented as a pseudosphere, which is a finite surface, like a sphere but with negative curvature.

Wait, wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let's compute the area. The area would be the integral over r from 0 to 2, and θ from 0 to 2π, of (32 r)/(4 - r²) dr dθ.

So A = ∫ (from 0 to 2π) ∫ (from 0 to 2) [32 r/(4 - r²)] dr dθ.

Let me compute the inner integral first. Let u = 4 - r^2, du = -2 r dr. So the integral becomes ∫ [32/(u)] (-du/2). The limits: when r=0, u=4; r=2, u=0.

So the integral becomes (32/(-2)) ∫ from u=4 to u=0 (1/u) du. That is (-16) [ln u] from 4 to 0. Wait, that would be (-16)(ln 0 - ln4). But ln 0 is negative infinity, so ln 0 - ln4 is negative infinity minus a finite number, which is negative infinity. So (-16) times (-infty) is positive infinity. Wait, but this is the integral over r from 0 to 2. That suggests that the area is infinite.

But the question is about a pseudosphere of radius r=2. Wait, a pseudosphere is a finite area object, right? So perhaps this metric isn't correctly representing a compact pseudosphere but instead represents an infinite surface, perhaps a hyperbolic plane. Because if r approaches
