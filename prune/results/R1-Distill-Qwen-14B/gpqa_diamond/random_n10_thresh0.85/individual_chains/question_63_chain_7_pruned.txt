Okay, so I've got this physics problem in front of me, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me read it again to make sure I understand what's being asked.

The question is about a diatomic molecule, made up of elements X and Y. The model used is the quantum rotation-vibration model, also called the non-rigid rotor model. The molecule is in its fundamental state, and we need to find the momentum of a photon that would cause it to transition to the next state with the lowest possible energy. 

Hmm, I remember that in quantum mechanics, diatomic molecules can be modeled using both rotational and vibrational energy levels. The fundamental state is the lowest energy state, which would correspond to the lowest vibrational level and the lowest rotational level. But wait, for rotation, the ground state is when the rotational quantum number is zero, right?

Wait, no, actually, for a rigid rotor, the energy levels are given by E_rot = (ħ² / 2I) * J(J+1), where J is the rotational quantum number. The ground state for rotation is J=0. But wait, the molecule is in the fundamental state, which I think is the lowest vibrational state as well. So the initial state is the vibrational ground state and rotational ground state.

Now, when a photon is absorbed, the molecule transitions to the next possible state. The next state with the lowest energy would probably be either the next vibrational state or the next rotational state. Wait, but which has a lower energy difference? I'm a bit confused here. Because for diatomic molecules, vibrational energy levels are quantized and have higher spacing than rotational levels. So the next state could be either a vibrational transition or a rotational transition. But in the rigid rotor model, the rotation is considered, but here it's the non-rigid rotor model, which probably means that the bond length can change, so the rotational energy depends on vibration as well. Hmm, perhaps I'm complicating things.

Wait, the problem says to model it using the quantum rotation-vibration model. So perhaps the energy levels are a combination of both rotation and vibration. But for this question, we're looking for the photon that causes the molecule to switch to the next state with the lowest possible energy. So the photon's energy should match the energy difference of the smallest possible transition.

Wait, but when you have both rotation and vibration, the energy levels are a product of both. So the fundamental state is the lowest vibrational level (n=0) and the lowest rotational level (J=0). The next possible state could be either J=1 (next rotational state) or n=1 (next vibrational state). We need to find which transition requires less energy, because the photon's energy must match that.

So the energy of a photon is given by E_photon = h*f = h*c/λ. But to find the momentum p of the photon, since p = h/λ = E/c. So the momentum is related to the photon's energy.

But first, I need to calculate the energy difference for both possible transitions and see which one is smaller. The smallest energy difference would correspond to the next state with the lowest possible energy, so that's the one the photon would cause.

So first, let's compute the energy spacing for the vibrational transition: from n=0 to n=1. The energy levels for vibration are given by E_vib = (n + 1/2) h w, where w is the angular frequency. So the energy difference ΔE_vib between n=0 and n=1 is h*w (since (1+1/2) - (0+1/2) = 1). So ΔE_vib = h * w.

Next, the rotational energy levels. For rotation, the energy is E_rot = B J(J+1), where B is the rotational constant. B is given by (ħ²)/(2I), with I being the moment of inertia. I for a diatomic is μ r², where μ is the reduced mass and r is the bond length.

Wait, but wait, since this is a non-rigid rotor model, the moment of inertia might not be constant, but perhaps for the purpose of this calculation, we can treat it as a rigid rotor. Or maybe the question is only considering the vibrational transition, but I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is assuming that the transition is purely vibrational. Because the question says the molecule is in the fundamental state, which is the lowest vibrational and rotational state. So the next state might be either a higher vibrational state or a higher rotational state, whichever requires less energy.

Wait, but for diatomic molecules, typically the spacing between rotational levels is smaller than the vibrational spacing. Because the vibrational energy levels are quantized with spacing h*w, which is typically in the infrared range, whereas rotational transitions are in the microwave, so smaller energy.

Wait, but let me think. Let's compute both. Let's calculate ΔE_vib and the ΔE_rot.

So, the vibrational energy difference is h*w. For the rotational, the ground state is J=0, and the next state is J=1. The energy for J=0 is 0, and for J=1, it's B * 1*(1+
