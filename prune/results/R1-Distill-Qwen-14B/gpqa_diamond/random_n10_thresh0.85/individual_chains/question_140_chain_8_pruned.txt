Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here. Let me try to break it down step by step. Hmm, the question is about a substance X reacting with liquid Y. Let me read it carefully.

So, substance X incorporates a heavier isotope of one of its constituent elements. That must mean X is some compound where one of the atoms is replaced by a heavier isotope. Like maybe deuterium instead of hydrogen? Because deuterium is a heavier isotope of hydrogen.

Then, when X reacts with liquid Y, it releases a gas W. The molecule of W has the same number of neutrons and protons. Oh, wait, same number in the molecule. So what gas has equal protons and neutrons per molecule? Let's think: for example, H2O has protons 2 (H) + 8 (O) =10, neutrons would be (1*2) + 8 (if O is 16, which is 8 protons and 8 neutrons) so maybe 10 as well. No, that's not the same. Wait, wait, the molecule as a whole must have equal number of protons and neutrons.

Wait, maybe it's something like CO2? Let me calculate. Carbon has 6 protons, oxygen has 8 each. CO2 would have 6 + 16 (2 O) = 22 protons. Neutrons? Carbon-12 has 6 neutrons, oxygen-16 has 8 each. So CO2 would have 6 + 16 (8*2) = 6 + 16 = 22 neutrons. So protons 22, neutrons 22. Oh, so the molecule has same number of protons and neutrons. That fits. So gas W could be CO2.

But wait, another possibility: maybe something like H2O? Let's see. H2O has 2 H (each 1p) and one O (8p), so 10 protons. Neutrons in O-16: 8. So total neutrons would be 8 (from O) + 0 (H) = 8. So 10 protons, 8 neutrons. Not equal. So that doesn't fit. So CO2 seems to fit as W.

So the reaction of X with Y produces CO2. What reaction produces CO2? Maybe a carbonate reacting with acid. But wait, let's think about what Y could be. Y is a liquid, so perhaps something like an acid. Wait, if X is a carbonate, maybe reacting with an acid (like H2SO4, which is a liquid when concentrated) would produce CO2.

Wait, but earlier when they said X is known for incorporating a heavier isotope, maybe X is something like sodium carbonate (Na2CO3) where one of the Na is replaced by a heavier isotope, like maybe something else. Or perhaps X is a heavy water compound.

Wait, alternative approach: think of X as a carbonate. When carbonate reacts with an acid, it produces CO2, water, and the corresponding salt. But in this case, the precipitate G forms. So maybe Y is not an acid, but something else.

Wait, maybe Y is a base. Let's think. Suppose X is a salt of a weak acid. If X reacts with a base, perhaps a carbonate reacting with a base to produce something else. Hmm, not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a hydroxide. Hmm.

Wait, let's think about the precipitate G. When heated, G releases B, whose melting point is close to 277 K. 277 K is about 4 degrees Celsius. What substance has a melting point close to that? Maybe something like ammonium chloride? No, that's higher. Wait, what about something like sodium hydroxide? No, melting point is higher. Wait, maybe it's something else.

Wait, 277 K is 4°C. So B is a solid that melts near there. So perhaps B is a kind of salt. Alternatively, maybe B is a metal. Let me think: metals like mercury melt around room temp, but 4°C is pretty low. Maybe it's a different
