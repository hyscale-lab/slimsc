Okay, so I've got this question about neutrinos from the Sun and the pp-III branch stopping. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my solar physics, but let me think through this.

So, the question is about the flux ratio of two neutrino energy bands after the pp-III reactions stop suddenly. The bands are 700-800 keV (band 1) and 800-900 keV (band 2). I need to find the ratio F1/F2.

Wait, what's the pp-III branch? Oh right, the proton-proton chain has several branches. The pp-I branch is the main one, leading to helium-4. The pp-II branch involves boron neutrinos, right? And the pp-III branch is another, less significant part. Oh, but wait, I think the pp-III branch is one of the later steps in the proton-proton chain, maybe producing higher-energy neutrinos.

Wait, neutrinos come from different processes in the sun. The main source is the pp chain, which produces electron neutrinos. There's also the CNO cycle, but that's a minor contributor. So, the pp chain has different branches. The pp-I branch produces a neutrino when a boron-8 nucleus decays into two alphas. But wait, the main pp chain is pp-I, and pp-II and pp-III are other branches. Wait, I think the pp-III branch produces higher energy neutrinos, maybe around 10-20 MeV or something? Or wait, no, maybe the neutrino energies are lower.

Wait, the neutrino energies from the Sun are typically in the MeV range. The most abundant are the 7 Be neutrinos which are around 0.8-1 MeV, and the CNO cycle produces lower energy neutrinos. The pp chain's main neutrino is the pep branch which is higher energy, like about 2.5 MeV, but I think I'm mixing things up.

Wait, the question is about the flux of neutrinos in two specific energy bands: 700-800 keV and 800-900 keV. Wait, 0.7-0.8 MeV and 0.8-0.9 MeV. That's in the sub-MeV range. Hmm, but I thought the main solar neutrinos are around 1 MeV and higher. Unless these are from other processes.

Wait, the question says the pp-III branch stops. So, what do the pp branches contribute in terms of neutrinos? Let me think. The main pp chain (pp-I) produces a neutrino when beryllium-7 captures a proton to form boron-8, then boron-8 decays into two alphas, emitting a neutrino. The energy of that neutrino is around 1.4 MeV. Then there are other branches, like the pp-II and pp-III, which are less dominant but still contribute. Like, the pp-II branch involves a different reaction, perhaps leading to a neutrino with a lower energy.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me try to outline the pp chain. The pp chain starts with two protons colliding, forming a deuterium and a positron and a neutrino. But wait, that's part of the chain. Then from there, the deuterium fuses with a proton to make tritium, and
