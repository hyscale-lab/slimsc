Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me read the question carefully.

The compound has the molecular formula C8H9NO. The NMR data is given, and it's reacted with three reagents in sequence: NaNO2 + HCl, then H2O, and finally aqueous KOH with heat. I need to find out what the final product is.

First, let's look at the NMR data to figure out the structure of the starting material. The NMR peaks are:

- 9.72 ppm (t, 1H)
- 6.98 ppm (d, 2H)
- 6.51 ppm (d, 2H)
- 6.27 ppm (bs, 2H)
- 3.66 ppm (d, 2H)

I remember that the integration is given in the parentheses, so each number corresponds to the number of protons. Let's break this down.

The peak at 9.72 ppm is a triplet with 1H. That's a high chemical shift, probably an aldehyde proton. Aldehyde protons typically show up around 9-10 ppm. So maybe this is an aldehyde group.

Looking at the next set: 6.98 (d, 2H) and 6.51 (d, 2H). These are in the aromatic region. The double doublets suggest maybe two sets of aromatic protons, each being a doublet. Also, the fact that their shifts are different suggests two different environments. Let me think—maybe this is a para-substituted aromatic ring attached to another aromatic ring. Like a biphenyl structure.

Wait, the 6.27 ppm (bs, 2H) could be some protons near an electron-withdrawing group. Benzene rings with substituents like -OH or -NO2 can cause neighboring protons to shift upfield or downfield. Or maybe these are protons on another ring attached to the main structure.

The 3.66 ppm (d, 2H) is a triplet of two protons. Maybe this is a CH2 group, perhaps adjacent to an oxygen. Because 3.66 is in the range for OCH2 or something similar. So perhaps an OCH2 group, or maybe a CH2 connected to an oxygen.

Putting this together: Let's think of a structure with an aldehyde group, some aromatic rings, and maybe some substituents.

Wait, the molecular formula is C8H9NO. Let's calculate the degree of unsaturation. Degrees of unsaturation formula is (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. Here, C=8, H=9, N=1, X=0.

So (2*8 +2 -9 +1)/2 = (18-9+1)/2 = 10/2 =5. So five degrees: probably a benzene ring (3), a double bond (1), and a ring or double bond for the other (maybe a carbonyl?).

Wait, the aldehyde is a carbonyl, so that's one. The benzene is three. Then the rest: maybe another double bond or a ring.

So the structure might be a benzaldehyde derivative with some substituents.

Looking at the NMR again: 1H at 9.72 as aldehyde. Then the aromatic signals suggest that there are two different types of aromatic protons. Let me think about a benzaldehyde that's attached to another benzene ring, perhaps.

Wait, another approach: Maybe the compound has a structure where the aldehyde is attached to a benzene ring, which is also connected to another aromatic group via a side chain.

Wait, let's think about the substitution patterns. The 6.98 and 6.51 are each two protons as doublets. So maybe it's a para-substituted benzene, and another para-substituted benzene attached.

Alternatively, maybe it's a di-substituted benzene. Let me imagine that the main structure is a benzene ring with an aldehyde group and another substituent, which is perhaps another benzene ring or a side chain.

Wait, the 3.66 (d, 2H) could be part of a CH2 group adjacent to an oxygen. So maybe an OCH2CH2- group, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the structure is a diphenyl compound with an aldehyde. Let me think about the substituents.

Let me try to draw a possible structure based on NMR:

- Aldehyde group (CHO) at the end of a chain. The aldehyde proton is the triplet at 9.72. Wait, why is it a triplet? Aldehydes are usually deshielded and appear as singlets. Hmm, maybe this isn't an aldehyde.

Wait, maybe it's not an aldehyde. Another possibility is an aromatic ring with a substituent that has a proton with a high shift. Wait, but 9.72 is very high, more aldehyde-like.

Wait, but wait, a triplet at 9.72 ppm. Aldehyde protons are usually singlets because they're at the end of the chain. So maybe it's not an aldehyde. Alternatively, maybe it's a vinylogous aldehyde or something else. Or maybe it's a carbonyl group adjacent to another proton.

Wait, another possibility: The 9.72 is an aromatic proton that's deshielded, perhaps in a strongly de-shielded position, like para to an electron-withdrawing group. Alternatively, it's an aldehyde.

Wait, let me think about the integration. 1H for the peak at 9.72. So that's one proton. So maybe it's an aldehyde.

So, the structure has an aldehyde group (CHO), and maybe a benzene ring attached to some other groups.

Looking at the 6.98 (d, 2H) and 6.51 (d, 2H): let's think of a benzene ring with two substituents. The two doublets each have 2H. So perhaps the ring has two substituents, each causing two protons to be split into doublets. That could mean a para-substituted benzene with two substituents. Wait, no, because para would have two sets of equivalent H. Wait, maybe it's ortho substitution.

Wait, for example, a benzene ring with a substituent in the para position, but perhaps another substituent attached to that.

Alternatively, maybe it's a biphenyl system. Let me consider that. If the compound is diphenyl something, like a diphenyl aldehyde.

Wait, but the molecular formula is C8H9NO. Let's count the carbons.

Suppose the main structure is a benzaldehyde (PhCHO). That would be C7H6O. But our formula is C8H9NO. So another group is present: perhaps a CH2 group or another substituent.

Wait, the 3.66 (d, 2H) is likely a CH2 connected to something. Let's see: for example, if the structure is Ph-CH2-O-R or something else. I'm not sure.

Another approach is to think about the reaction steps. The reagents are:

1. NaNO2 + HCl: This is typically used for diazotization, converting an amine to a diazonium salt. But wait, the starting material's formula is C8H9NO. Let me see: the molecular formula has one N. So, if the starting compound has an amino group, then after diazotization, it would form a diazonium salt.

Wait, but the starting material has a molecular formula of C8H9NO. So, that's 8 carbons, 9 hydrogens, 1 nitrogen, and 1 oxygen. The reaction steps: first, diazotization, then H2O (maybe hydrolysis), then KOH and heat (likely elimination or some other reaction).

So, perhaps the starting material is an aniline derivative, which gets converted to a diazonium salt, which then undergoes some reaction.

But wait, the NMR doesn't show any amine protons. Because if it were aniline, the aromatic protons would be different. Wait, but the NMR has a triplet at 9.72, which could be an aldehyde. Hmm.

Alternatively, the starting compound could be a nitro group? The formula includes an N and O, but I'm not sure. Let me think again.

Wait, the NMR shows 9.72 ppm (t, 1H). Could that be a proton adjacent to an oxygen, like in a nitro group? Probably not, because nitro groups don't have protons. Alternatively, maybe it's a methyl group adjacent to an oxygen, but the peak is a triplet.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Let me try to come up with a structure that fits the NMR.

So, maybe the structure is a diphenyl compound with an aldehyde group and an ether link.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think about the reaction steps again.

The first reagent is NaNO2 and HCl. That's for diazotization, typically done with an aromatic amine. So if the starting compound has an aromatic amine (like aniline), it would form a diazonium chloride upon treatment with NaNO2 and HCl.

But wait, the starting compound has a molecular formula of C8H9NO—if it has an amino group (-NH2), the formula would be C8H9NO, because NH2 contributes one N and two H. But wait, the starting formula has one N.
