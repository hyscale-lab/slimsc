Okay, so I've got this question about the quantum rotation-vibration model, also known as the non-rigid rotor model. Hmm, I remember that this model describes diatomic molecules considering both rotational and vibrational energies. The question is about a molecule in its fundamental state absorbing a photon and moving to the next lowest energy state.

Wait, the molecule is in its fundamental state. I think the fundamental state is the state with the lowest possible energy, which is the ground state. So the molecule is in the lowest vibrational and rotational states. When it absorbs a photon, it jumps to the next state. But wait, what's the next state? Because in the rotation-vibration model, energy levels are quantized and there are vibrational and rotational contributions.

I remember that the energy levels for a diatomic molecule can be expressed as a combination of vibrational and rotational energies. The total energy is the sum of vibrational and rotational parts. The fundamental state is the lowest vibrational state (v=0) and the lowest rotational state (which would be the ground rotational state, maybe J=0 or J=1? Because for a diatomic, the ground state for rotation is J=0, but I'm a bit fuzzy on that. Wait, no, for rigid rotor, the rotational energy levels are given by (ħ²/(2I))J(J+1), where J is an integer. So the ground rotational state is J=0, which is the lowest.

So when the molecule absorbs a photon, it can either increase its vibrational state or its rotational state. But the question is about the lowest possible energy increase, so it's probably a transition to the next possible state with minimal energy. So the next state
