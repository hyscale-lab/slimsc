Okay, I'm trying to solve this astronomy problem. Let me read it carefully and think through each part.

So, the question is about a star with certain parameters and how the presence of dark spots affects the ratio of neutral titanium atoms in two energy levels. Hmm, I remember that the ratio of atoms in different energy levels can be explained using the Boltzmann equation, which relates the populations of energy levels to temperature.

The star's parameters without spots are 1.5 solar radii and 1.1 solar masses. Its effective temperature (Teff) is 6000 K. But when 40% of its surface is covered by spots, the overall Teff drops to 5500 K. So the spots are making the star appear cooler overall.

The observed ratio of Ti atoms in two energy levels (level 1 and level 2) decreases when the star has spots. The transition between these levels corresponds to about 1448 Å, which is in the near-ultraviolet or far-ultraviolet range. Wait, but the exact wavelength might not be as important as the fact that it's a specific photon transition.

The question is asking for the factor by which this ratio changes when the star doesn't have spots compared to when it does. So, the ratio without spots divided by the ratio with spots.

In LTE (Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium), the ratio of populations of two energy levels can be given by the Boltzmann equation. The formula is n2/n1 = (g2/g1) * exp( - (E2 - E1)/(k T) ), where g1 and g2 are the statistical weights, E2 and E1 are the energies, and k is the Boltzmann constant, T is temperature.

Wait, but wait. Let's get the exact setup. The ratio is level 1 to level 2. So the ratio is n1/n2 = (g1/g2) * exp( (E2 - E1)/(k T) ). Or wait, no. The ratio is n_upper / n_lower = (g_upper/g_lower) * exp( -ΔE/(k T) ), where ΔE is E_upper - E_lower. So if level 2 is higher in energy, then E2 > E1. So n2/n1 = (g2/g1) * exp( -(E2 - E1)/(k T) )

But the problem says when the star has spots, the overall effective temperature decreases. So the Teff goes from 6000 K to 5500 K. But wait, are we considering the temperature of the entire photosphere changing, or the temperature in the spotted regions?

Hmm, the first part says when the spots are present, the overall photospheric effective temperature decreases. So the photosphere as a whole is cooler. So the effective temperature of the entire star is 5500 K when spots are present. So when the star has spots, the average T is lower.

But wait, maybe the spots are cooler regions. So the star's overall photosphere has a lower average T. Wait, but the star is a mix of spotted and unspotted regions. So perhaps the effective temperature is a weighted average. But I'm not sure if that's needed here; the problem states that the Teff drops to 5500 K when
