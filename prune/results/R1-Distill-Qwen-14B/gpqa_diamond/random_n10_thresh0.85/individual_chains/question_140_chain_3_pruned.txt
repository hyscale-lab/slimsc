Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question says.

The problem talks about a substance X that reacts violently with liquid Y, releasing a gas W. Gas W's molecule has the same number of neutrons and protons. Then, a precipitate G forms which, when heated, releases B. The melting point of B is close to 277 K. Also, when a certain keto acid reacts with substance X, the product has 2 oxygen atoms. Substance X and its analog are used as reagents in organic chemistry. I need to find the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements in X.

Hmm. Let me break this down.

First, let's think about substance X. It's known for incorporating a heavier isotope of one of its elements. So X has an isotope with a higher mass. Wait, but isotopes are variants of the same element, so the heavier isotope would be part of an element in X. Maybe X is a compound where one of the elements has an isotope present.

The reaction with liquid Y is violent, so it's probably a strong reaction. The gas released, W, has the same number of neutrons and protons in its molecule. So W is a molecule where each atom has equal protons and neutrons. Let me think. The most common such gas I can think of is CO2, but wait, in CO2, each molecule is one C and two O. C has 6 protons, O has 8. But gas W's molecule must have same number of protons and neutrons per molecule? Or per atom? Wait, the question says the molecule has same number of neutrons and protons. Let me re-read that: "a gas W whose molecule contains the same number of neutrons and protons." So in the entire molecule, the total number of neutrons equals the total protons. So for example, if it's H2O, H has 1 proton each, O has 8. Total protons: 2 +8=10. Neutrons: each H has 0, O has 8, so total 8. So 10 vs 8, not equal. So not H2O. Let's think of another possibility.

Wait, maybe W is NH3? Let me check. NH3 has each N as 7 protons and 7 neutrons (wait, nitrogen has atomic number 7, so protons=7, neutrons=7 for isotope N-14). Each H has 1 proton, 0 neutrons. So molecule: protons = 7 +3*1=10. Neutrons: 7 +3*0=7. Not equal. So that's not it.

Wait, maybe CO2? Let's calculate. C has 6 protons, 6 neutrons (C-12). O has 8 protons, 8 neutrons (O-16). So CO2 has 6 + 8*2 = 22 protons. Neutrons: 6 + 8*2=22. Oh! So CO2 has 22 protons and 22 neutrons in the molecule. That matches the condition. So gas W is probably CO2. So when X reacts with Y, CO2 is released.

So what
