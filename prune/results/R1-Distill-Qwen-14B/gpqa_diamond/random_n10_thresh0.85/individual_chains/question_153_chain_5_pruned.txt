Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here about Michael addition reactions. Hmm, I remember that the Michael reaction involves enolates attacking an alpha-beta unsaturated carbonyl. But wait, let me think. The enolate is a nucleophile, right? And it attacks the beta position of another carbonyl compound, which is the Michael acceptor.

The question has three parts: A, B, and C. Each is a reaction, and I need to figure out the products based on the reactants given. Then, select the correct option from A to D.

Starting with reaction A: dimethyl malonate plus methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate with NaOEt in EtOH. So, NaOEt is a base, probably deprotonating something to form an enolate.

Dimethyl malonate is (CH3CO)2CH2. It's a good donor in Michael reactions because it can form a conjugate base, which is a strong nucleophile. So, in this case, the base (NaOEt) would deprotonate the alpha position of dimethyl malonate, creating a malonate enolate. The enolate would then attack the beta position of the methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate.

Wait, the structure of methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate: the acrylate is CH2=CH-CO-OCH3, but wait, no. Wait, 3-(p-tolyl)acrylate would be CH2=CH-CO-OCH3 but with the substituent on the third carbon? Wait, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Acrylate is CH2=CHCOOR. If it's 3-(p-tolyl)acrylate, that would be CH2=CH-CO-OCH3 with a p-tolyl group attached where? Wait, the acrylate is CH2=CHCOOR. So the substituent is on the third carbon, which is the beta position relative to the carbonyl. So the structure would be CH2=C(p-tolyl)COOCH3? Wait no, wait. Hmm, perhaps it's CH2=CH
