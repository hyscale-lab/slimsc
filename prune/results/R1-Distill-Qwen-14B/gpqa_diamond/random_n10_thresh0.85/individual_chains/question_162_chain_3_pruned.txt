Okay, so I'm trying to solve this problem about the area of a pseudosphere with a specific metric. Hmm, I remember that a pseudosphere is a type of surface in hyperbolic geometry, right? But wait, I'm a bit confused. So the question gives me a metric:

ds² = (32)/(4 - x² - y²) (dx² + dy²)

And I need to find the area of the pseudosphere when the radius r is 2. Wait, the radius is given as r=2, so that's probably a clue. But I'm not sure how the radius relates to the metric given here.

First, maybe I should recall what a pseudosphere is. Oh right, a pseudosphere is a surface of constant negative curvature. The metric given here seems to be in two dimensions, so maybe it's a model of hyperbolic space. Oh wait, but I'm supposed to find the area, so perhaps I need to calculate the area of this space using the given metric.

Wait, the metric is given in terms of x and y. So maybe it's a coordinate system. Let me think about how to compute the area from a metric. In general relativity, the area element is sqrt(g_xy) dx dy, where g_xy is the determinant of the metric tensor. But wait,
