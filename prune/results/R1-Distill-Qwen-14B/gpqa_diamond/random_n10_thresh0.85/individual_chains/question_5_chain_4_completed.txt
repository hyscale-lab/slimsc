Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. I'm a bit rusty, but let's try to think through it step by step.

The question is about finding the eigenvector of a quantum mechanical operator P for a muon along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane. The eigenvalue is given as +ħ/2. Hmm, I remember that in quantum mechanics, the eigenstates of an operator correspond to its possible measurement outcomes. So, the eigenvector here would represent a state where measuring the component along direction n would definitely give +ħ/2.

The operator P is given in terms of its components P_x, P_y, and P_z. Each of these is a 2x2 matrix multiplied by ħ/2. Let me jot down what each component looks like:

P_x = ħ/2 * [[0, 1],
             [1, 0]]

P_y = ħ/2 * [[0, -i],
            [i, 0]]

P_z = ħ/2 * [[1, 0],
            [0, -1]]

Wait, I think these are the standard Pauli matrices multiplied by ħ/2. Oh right! Because the Pauli matrices are σ_x, σ_y, σ_z, and each is scaled by ħ/2 here.

So, the operator P along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane. The direction n can be represented as a unit vector. Since it's in the x-z plane, the y-component is zero. So, n can be written as (sinθ cosφ, 0, sinθ sinφ) but wait, no, wait. Because in spherical coordinates, θ is the polar angle from the z-axis, and φ is the azimuthal angle in the x-y plane. But since the vector is in the x-z plane, φ would be zero or π, depending on the direction. Actually, maybe I should parameterize it differently. Oh wait, perhaps n is (sinθ, 0, cosθ), since when θ is 0, it's along +z, and θ=90 would be along +x.

So, the operator P along direction n is given by P = n · (P_x, P_y, P_z). That is, P = n_x P_x + n_y P_y + n_z P_z. But since n is in the x-z plane, n_y is zero. So, P = n_x P_x + n_z P_z.

But wait, the problem states that the muon's spin is being considered. Oh wait, but muons have spin-1/2, so the spin operator components are indeed given by these Pauli matrices multiplied by ħ/2.

Wait, so the operator P is P = (n_x P_x) + (n_z P_z). Since n is a unit vector, n_x² + n_z² = 1.

So, substituting the values:

n_x = sinθ, n_z = cosθ (assuming θ is the angle from the +z axis, so when θ=0, it's +z direction, θ=90 is +x).

Wait, actually, sometimes the parameterization is n = (cosθ, 0, sinθ), but I'm a bit confused. Let me think again. The direction in x-z plane can be represented as (cosθ, 0, sinθ) where θ is measured from the z-axis. Alternatively, some might use θ from the x-axis. But I think in this case, it's more natural to say θ is the angle from the z-axis, so n is (sinθ, 0, cosθ). Wait, no, wait. Because in spherical coordinates, the polar angle θ is measured from the positive z-axis. So the x component would be sinθ cosφ, z component is cosθ. But since we're in x-z plane, φ is zero. So n is (sinθ, 0, cosθ). Because when θ=0, you're at (0,0,1), and when θ=90 degrees, you're at (1,0,0). So that makes sense.

So n_x = sinθ, n_z = cosθ. So P = (sinθ) P_x + (cosθ) P_z.

Substituting the matrices:

P = sinθ * (ħ/2) [[0,1],[1,0]] + cosθ * (ħ/2) [[1,0],[0,-1]]

Let me compute that. Let's factor out ħ/2.

P = (ħ/2) [ [ cosθ, sinθ ], [ sinθ, -cosθ ] ]

Wait, let me do the matrix multiplication:

First, (sinθ) * [[0,1],[1,0]] gives [[0, sinθ], [sinθ, 0]]

Second, (cosθ)*[[1,0],[0,-1]] gives [[cosθ, 0], [0, -cosθ]]

Adding them together:

[[cosθ, sinθ],
 [sinθ, -cosθ]]

So the matrix for P is (ħ/2) multiplied by this.

Now, we need to find the eigenvector corresponding to the eigenvalue +ħ/2.

Eigenvalue equation: P |v> = (+ħ/2) |v>

Which can be written as:

(ħ/2) [ [cosθ, sinθ], [sinθ, -cosθ] ] |v> = (ħ/2) |v>

Multiply both sides by 2/ħ to simplify:

[ [cosθ, sinθ], [sinθ, -cosθ] ] |v> = |v>

So the matrix equation is:

[cosθ   sinθ] [a]   [a]
[sinθ  -cosθ] [b] = [b]

Which gives two equations:

cosθ * a + sinθ * b = a
sinθ * a - cosθ * b = b

So equation 1: (cosθ - 1) a + sinθ b = 0
Equation 2: sinθ a + (-cosθ -1) b = 0

Wait, let me rearrange equation 1:

cosθ a + sinθ b = a → (cosθ - 1) a + sinθ b = 0.

Equation 2: sinθ a - cosθ b = b → sinθ a + (- cosθ -1) b = 0.

Hmm, perhaps I can write this system as:

( (cosθ -1) ) a + (sinθ) b = 0
(sinθ) a + ( -cosθ -1 ) b = 0

This is a homogeneous system, so the determinant of the coefficients should be zero for non-trivial solutions. Let me compute the determinant:

| (cosθ -1)   sinθ      |
| sinθ        (-cosθ -1) |

Determinant D = (cosθ -1)(-cosθ -1) - (sinθ)(sinθ)

Let me compute this:

= ( -cos^2θ - cosθ + cosθ +1 ) - sin^2θ
Wait, expanding (cosθ-1)(-cosθ-1):
= cosθ * (-cosθ) + cosθ*(-1) -1*(-cosθ) -1*1
= -cos²θ - cosθ + cosθ +1
= -cos²θ + 1.

So D = (-cos²θ +1 ) - sin²θ.

But wait, (-cos²θ +1) is sin²θ. So D = sin²θ - sin²θ = 0.

Which makes sense because we have an eigenvalue equation, so the system is dependent, and we expect non-trivial solutions.

So from equation 1: (cosθ -1) a + sinθ b = 0.

We can express a in terms of b or vice versa.

Let me solve for a.

(cosθ -1) a = - sinθ b → a = [ - sinθ / (cosθ -1) ) ] b.

But cosθ -1 is negative of (1 - cosθ), so a = [ sinθ / (1 - cosθ) ) ] b.

Hmm, but 1 - cosθ = 2 sin²(theta/2), and sinθ = 2 sin(theta/2) cos(theta/2). So substituting:

a = [2 sin(theta/2) cos(theta/2) ] / [ 2 sin²(theta/2) ]  * b.

Simplify:

a = [ cos(theta/2) / sin(theta/2) ] * b.

Which is cot(theta/2) * b.

So a = cot(theta/2) b.

Let me set b = 1 for simplicity (since eigenvectors are defined up to a scalar), then a = cot(theta/2).

But wait, when theta approaches 0, cot(theta/2) goes to infinity. That can't be right. Maybe I should parameterize differently.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to express the ratio as a = [ sinθ / (1 - cosθ) ) ] * b.

Wait, let me compute that ratio:

sinθ/(1 - cosθ) = [2 sin(theta/2) cos(theta/2)] / [2 sin²(theta/2)] ]

Simplify numerator and denominator:

= [ 2 sin(theta/2) cos(theta/2) ] / [ 2 sin^2(theta/2) ]

= cos(theta/2) / sin(theta/2) = cot(theta/2)

So same result.

So the eigenvector can be written as [a, b] = [ cot(theta/2), 1 ].

Wait, but this is a 2-component vector. Let me write it as:

|v> = [ a, b ]^T = [ cot(theta/2), 1 ]^T.

But wait, I should express this in terms of normalized components. Because eigenvectors are only defined up to a scalar multiple, so I can choose b = 1. Then a = cot(theta/2).

But I need to normalize the vector. So the normalization condition is |a|^2 + |b|^2 = 1.

So |a|^2 is cot^2(theta/2), |b|^2 is 1. So 1 + cot^2(theta/2) = csc^2(theta/2).

So the normalization factor is 1/sqrt(1 + cot^2(theta/2)) ) = 1 / sqrt(csc^2(theta/2)) ) = sin(theta/2).

Wait, let me compute that:

sqrt(1 + cot²(theta/2)) ) = csc(theta/2), because 1 + cot^2 = csc^2.

So normalization factor is 1/csc(theta/2) = sin(theta/2).

So the normalized eigenvector is:

[ (cot(theta/2) ) * sin(theta/2), 1 * sin(theta/2) ) ]

Wait, let's compute this.

cot(theta/2) = cos(theta/2)/sin(theta/2).

So the first component becomes [ cos(theta/2)/sin(theta/2) ) ] * sin(theta/2) ) = cos(theta/2).

Second component is sin(theta/2).

So the normalized eigenvector is [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ].

But wait, that's the same as option C: (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)).

But looking at the options, option C is written as (\cos(\theta/2), \sin(\theta/2)).

Wait, but wait a second. Because in the problem statement, the operator is along direction n in the x-z plane, which is given, and the eigenvector is for eigenvalue +ħ/2. But wait, the way we derived it, the eigenvector is [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ].

But looking at the options, option C is that. But wait, wait, the question says the eigenvector is for a muon. Wait, muon's spin is ½, so it's a two-level system.

Wait, but another point: the expression for the eigenvector in terms of theta, which is the angle of the direction n. So the direction is given by theta from the z-axis, and the eigenvector is [cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)].

So the answer would be option C.

But looking at the other options:

Option D: sqrt(2/3) hbar cos(theta/2), sqrt(1/3) hbar sin(theta/2). Hmm, that doesn't align with what I got.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the direction. Let me think again.

Wait, when the spin is measured along direction n, the spin-up state is ( cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ), but only when you're using the eigenbasis aligned with n. But wait, how exactly is the spin state represented.

Alternatively, perhaps the parametrization is different. Because the direction n is in x-z plane, but in the problem statement, the operator P is written as n · (P_x, P_y, P_z), which would be n_x P_x + n_z P_z, as earlier.

Wait, but perhaps the eigenstate is expressed in terms of the eigenstates of S_z or S_x or something else. Hmm.

Wait, let me think about the eigenstates for spin in an arbitrary direction. The eigenstates for spin along n are |+> = [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ] and |-> = [ -sin(theta/2), cos(theta/2) ].

Wait, that's right. Because the spin-up state in direction n is given by the spherical harmonics with m=+1, which for spin-1/2 is ( cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) )^T. So yeah, our earlier result holds.

So the normalized eigenvector is [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ].

Looking back at the options, option C is exactly that. So the answer should be C.

Wait, but let me check the other options:

Option B is (cos(theta), e^{i phi} sin(theta)), which seems like a spherical coordinate, but for a spin-1/2 system, that's not correct. Because spin states are represented with theta/2.

Option D has sqrt(2/3) and sqrt(1/3) factors, which suggests some specific direction, perhaps along x-z. But the problem is for an arbitrary direction, so the answer should involve theta and phi. But in our case, since the direction is in x-z plane, phi is zero, so the answer is purely in terms of theta. Wait, but the eigenvector is in terms of theta/2. So only option C fits.

Wait, but looking at the options again, option C is (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)), which is exactly what we derived.

So the answer is option C.


The problem involves finding the normalized eigenvector of a quantum mechanical operator $\vec{P}$ for a muon along an arbitrary direction $\vec{n}$ in the x-z plane, corresponding to the eigenvalue $+\hbar/2$. The operator $\vec{P}$ is defined in terms of its components $P_x$, $P_y$, and $P_z$, which are proportional to the Pauli matrices scaled by $\hbar/2$. Since $\vec{n}$ lies in the x-z plane, the operator simplifies to $P = n_x P_x + n_z P_z$, where $n_x = \sin\theta$ and $n_z = \cos\theta$.

Substituting the matrices for $P_x$ and $P_z$, the operator $P$ becomes:

\[
P = \frac{\hbar}{2} 
\begin{bmatrix}
\cos\theta & \sin\theta \\
\sin\theta & -\cos\theta
\end{bmatrix}.
\]

The eigenvalue equation $P |v\rangle = (+\hbar/2) |v\rangle$ simplifies to:

\[
\begin{bmatrix}
\cos\theta & \sin\theta \\
\sin\theta & -\cos\theta
\end{bmatrix}
\begin{bmatrix}
a \\
b
\end{bmatrix}
=
\begin{bmatrix}
a \\
b
\end{bmatrix}.
\]

From the first row of the matrix equation, $(\cos\theta - 1)a + \sin\theta b = 0$, which gives the ratio $a = \cot(\theta/2) b$. Setting $b = 1$ for simplicity, the eigenvector becomes:

\[
|v\rangle = 
\begin{bmatrix}
\cot(\theta/2) \\
1
\end{bmatrix}.
\]

To normalize the eigenvector, the normalization factor is computed as $\sin(\theta/2)$, leading to the normalized eigenvector:

\[
|v\rangle = 
\begin{bmatrix}
\cos(\theta/2) \\
\sin(\theta/2)
\end{bmatrix}.
\]

This matches option C, which is written as $(\cos(\theta/2), \sin(\theta/2))$. The other options are inconsistent with the derived result:

- **Option A**: Incorrect because it introduces unnecessary factors of $\hbar$ and does not involve $\theta/2$.
- **Option B**: Incorrect because it involves $\theta$ and $\phi$, which are not relevant for the eigenstate in this context.
- **Option D**: Incorrect because it introduces specific coefficients ($\sqrt{2/3}$ and $\sqrt{1/3}$) that do not generalize to an arbitrary direction.

Thus, the correct normalized eigenvector is given by option C.

**Answer: C**
