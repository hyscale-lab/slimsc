Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question says.

So, there are two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than Star_2. Wait, and the mass is also 1.5 times larger. Hmm, but I'm not sure if the mass comes into play here directly. The question is about luminosity, which I think relates more to radius and temperature.

They did some spectroscopy and found that the wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest are the same. Oh right, the peak wavelength for a black body is given by Wien's Law, which is lambda_max = b / T, where b is Wien's displacement constant and T is the temperature. So if lambda_max is the same for both stars, their temperatures must be the same. Because if T increases, lambda_max decreases, right? So same lambda_max means same T.

Wait, but can that be right? Because if Star_1 is larger in radius but same peak wavelength, same temperature. So T1 = T2. Interesting.

Then, the radial velocities are given. Star_1 has 0 km/s, Star_2 has 700 km/s. Wait, radial velocity is the speed at which the star is moving towards or away from us. But how does that affect luminosity? Oh, right, maybe it's about Doppler shift. Because if a star is moving towards us, its light gets blueshifted, and moving away causes redshift.

In this problem, Star_1 has zero radial velocity, so no Doppler shift. Star_2 is moving towards us at 700 km/s, so its light is blueshifted. But wait, the peak wavelength was determined from their spectra. Oh, but the question says that the wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest (the peak) are the same. So maybe the observed wavelengths are the same, but the intrinsic (rest) wavelengths would be different because of the Doppler effect.

Wait, that's a possibility. Because if Star_2 is moving towards us, its emitted light is blueshifted, so the observed peak would be at a shorter wavelength. But the question says the observed wavelengths are the same. So perhaps the Doppler effect must be considered when finding the intrinsic temperatures.

Hmm, this is getting a bit tricky. Let me think again.

Star_1: radial velocity 0 km/s. So the observed wavelength lambda_1 is equal to the emitted wavelength lambda_max1. Because no Doppler shift.

Star_2: radial velocity 700 km/s towards us, so the observed wavelength lambda_2 is lambda_max2 multiplied by (1 - v/c), because of the Doppler effect for receding or approaching. Wait, wait, the formula for relativistic Doppler shift when moving towards the observer is lambda_observed = lambda_source * sqrt( (1 - beta)/(1 + beta) ) ), where beta is v/c. But wait, no, actually, for a source moving towards the observer at speed v, the observed frequency is higher (blueshifted), so lambda_observed = lambda_source * sqrt( (1 - beta)/(1 + beta) ) ). Or wait, maybe the exact formula is (1 + v/c) for small velocities. Hmm, but given that 700 km/s is a significant fraction of the speed of light (which is about 3e5 km/s), so v/c is about 0.00233. So maybe we can approximate it as (1 + v/c).

Wait, but perhaps more accurately, the Doppler shift formula for wavelength when the source is moving towards the observer is:

lambda_observed = lambda_rest * (1 - v/c) / sqrt(1 - v^2/c^2)

Wait, I'm getting confused here. Let's clarify.

The relativistic Doppler effect formula for wavelength is:

lambda_observed = lambda_rest * sqrt( (1 + beta) / (1 - beta) ) 

Wait, no, that's for a source moving away. Because when a source moves away, the observed wavelength is longer (redshift). So if the source is moving towards us, the observed wavelength is shorter (blueshifted), so lambda_observed = lambda_rest * sqrt( (1 - beta)/(1 + beta) ) ), where beta is v/c.

Alternatively, the formula can be written as lambda_observed = lambda_rest * (1 - beta)/(1 + beta) )^(1/2).

Wait, another approach: the Doppler shift formula for frequency is f_obs = f_rest * sqrt( (1 + beta) / (1 - beta) ) ), when the source is moving towards the observer at speed v. Hmm, but I'm not entirely confident. Maybe it's better to think in terms of observed wavelength.

Wait, the general relativistic Doppler shift formula is:

lambda_obs = lambda_rest * sqrt( (1 + v/c) / (1 - v/c) ) )

Wait, that's when the source is moving away. Because when moving away, the wavelength is longer, so the observed wavelength is larger. So if v is positive when moving towards, then the denominator would be (1 - v/c), but I'm getting a bit stuck here.

Alternatively, the formula can be written as lambda_obs / lambda_rest = sqrt( (1 + beta) / (1 - beta) ), where beta is v/c for a source moving away. So if v is negative (moving towards), then beta is negative, so it becomes sqrt( (1 - beta) / (1 + beta) ), which is less than 1, so lambda_obs is less than lambda_rest, which makes sense for blueshift.

So given that Star_2 is moving towards us at 700 km/s, its observed lambda is lambda_2 = lambda_rest2 * sqrt( (1 - beta)/(1 + beta) ), where beta is 700e3 / (3e5) ) ≈ 0.002333.

Wait, but in the problem statement, the observed lambda_max for both stars is the same. So lambda_obs1 = lambda_rest1, because Star_1's radial velocity is zero. And lambda_obs2 = lambda_rest2 * sqrt( (1 - beta)/(1 + beta) ), since it's moving towards us.

But the problem says the observed wavelengths are the same. So lambda_obs1 = lambda_obs2.

So lambda_rest1 = lambda_rest2 * sqrt( (1 - beta)/(1 + beta) )

But earlier, the problem says that the wavelengths at which the stars appeared brightest are the same. Wait, here's the confusion. The problem says, "the wavelengths at which the stars appeared brightest, and found that they are the same." So the observed lambda_max is the same for both stars. So lambda_obs1 = lambda_obs2 = lambda_max.

So for Star_1, since its velocity is zero, lambda_rest1 = lambda_max.

For Star_2, lambda_obs2 = lambda_rest2 * sqrt( (1 - beta)/(1 + beta) ) = lambda_max.

So lambda_rest2 = lambda_max * sqrt( (1 + beta)/(1 - beta) )

But from Wien's law, lambda_rest is proportional to 1/T. So T1 = b / lambda_rest1, T2 = b / lambda_rest2.

So T1 = (b) / (lambda_max).

T2 = (b) / (lambda_rest2) = (b) / (lambda_max * sqrt( (1 + beta)/(1 - beta) )) ) = T1 * sqrt( (1 - beta)/(1 + beta) )

Wait, let me compute that again. lambda_rest2 = lambda_max * sqrt( (1 + beta)/(1 - beta) ), so T2 = (b) / (lambda_rest2) = (b) / (lambda_max * sqrt( (1 + beta)/(1 - beta) )) )

Which is T1 * [ 1 / sqrt( (1 + beta)/(1 - beta) ) ) ] = T1 * sqrt( (1 - beta)/(1 + beta) )

So T2 = T1 * sqrt( (1 - beta)/(1 + beta) )

But since beta is small (v=700e3 m/s, c=3e5 km/s, so beta=0.00233), we can approximate sqrt( (1 - beta)/(1 + beta) ) ≈ 1 - beta. Because for small x, sqrt( (1-x)/(1+x) ) ≈ 1 - x.

Wait, let's test that. Let x = beta. So (1 - x)/(1 + x) = (1 - x)(1 -x + x^2 - ... ) ≈ 1 - 2x + x^2 - ... . The square root of that would be approximately 1 - x, since sqrt(1 - 2x + x^2) ≈ 1 - x.

So T2 ≈ T1 (1 - beta )

So the temperature of Star_2 is slightly lower than Star_1. Hmm, doesn't seem like it would make a huge difference, but perhaps in the calculation, it's necessary to compute it accurately.

But wait, maybe it's better to compute beta = 700e3 / (3e5) ) = 7e5 / 3e5 = 7/3 ≈ 2.333... wait no, 700,000 m/s divided by 300,000,000 m/s is 700e3 / 3e5 = (7e5)/(3e5) ) = 7/3 = 2.333...? Wait, wait no, 700,000 m/s is 7e5 m/s, and 3e5 km/s is 3e5 * 1e3 m/s = 3e8 m/s. Oh wait no, wait:

Wait, 3e5 km/s is 300,000 km/s = 3e5 * 1e3 m/s = 3e8 m/s. So 700 km/s is 7e5 m/s. So beta = v/c = (7e5 m/s) / (3e8 m/s) ) = 7/(300) ) ≈ 0.023333.

Ah, okay, that's about 0.02333, so beta is approximately 0.02333.

So, sqrt( (1 - beta)/(1 + beta) ) = sqrt( (1 - 0.02333)/(1 + 0.02333) ) )

Let me compute the numerator: 1 - 0.02333 ≈ 0.97667.

Denominator: 1 + 0.02333 ≈ 1.02333.

So (0.97667)/(1.02333) ≈ (0.97667)/(1.02333) ≈ 0.9545 approximately.

Wait, let me compute it more accurately.

0.97667 divided by 1.02333:

Approx: Let me compute it as (1 - 0.02333) / (1 + 0.02333) = [ (1 - a) / (1 + a) ] where a=0.02333.

We can use the approximation for small a: (1 - a)/(1 + a) ≈ (1 - 2a) when a is small.

Because (1 - a) = 1 - a, (1 + a) = 1 + a, so their ratio is approximately (1 - a) (1 - a) ) = 1 - 2a, using the approximation 1/(1+a) ≈ 1 - a.

So with a=0.02333, (1- a)/(1 + a) ≈ 1 - 2a = 1 - 0.04666 = 0.95334.

So the square root of that is sqrt(0.95334) ≈ 0.97638.

Wait, because sqrt(0.95334) is approximately 0.97638, because 0.976^2 is approximately 0.952. Let me check:

0.976 * 0.976 = 952.576, so 0.976^2 = 0.952.576. Oh wait, but 0.976^2 is 0.952576, which is about 0.9526, which is just above 0.95334. So maybe 0.97638^2 ≈ 0.9532, which is close.

So sqrt( 0.95334 ) ≈ 0.97638.

Hmm, so back to T2 = T1 * 0.97638.

So T2 is about 97.6% of T1.

Now, the luminosity of a star is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann law: L = 4π R² σ T⁴.

So L is proportional to R² T⁴.

So for Star_1 and Star_2:

L1 = 4π R1² σ T1⁴

L2 = 4π R2² σ T2⁴

The factor by which L1 is larger than L2 is (L1 / L2) = (R1² T1⁴) / (R2² T2⁴ )

Given that R1 = 1.5 R2.

So R1/R2 = 1.5 → R1²/R2² = (1.5)^2 = 2.25.

And T2 = T1 * 0.97638 → T1/T2 = 1 / 0.97638 ≈ 1.0242.

So T1⁴/T2⁴ = (1.0242)^4.

Let me compute that. 1.0242^2 is approximately 1.049 (since 1.024^2 = 1.048576). So 1.049^2 ≈ 1.098.

Wait, more accurately: (1.0242)^4.

Compute (1.0242)^2:

1.0242 * 1.0242 ≈ 1.0490.

Then square that: 1.0490^2 ≈ 1.049 * 1.049 = 1.1004.

Wait, 1.049 * 1.049: 1*1 =1, 0.049*1=0.049, 1*0.049=0.049, 0.049*0.049=0.002401. So sum: 1 + 0.049 + 0.049 + 0.002401 = 1.100401.

So T1^4/T2^4 ≈ 1.1004.

So putting it all together:

(L1 / L2) = (2.25) * (1.1004) ≈ 2.25 * 1.1004 ≈ 2.25 * 1.1 = 2.475, but more accurately:

1.1004 * 2.25 = ?

Let me compute:

2.25 * 1 = 2.25

2.25 * 0.1 = 0.225

2.25 * 0.0004 = 0.0009

So sum: 2.25 + 0.225 = 2.475 + 0.0009 = 2.4759.

So approximately 2.4759.

Wait, but wait a moment. I think I might have made a mistake in computing T1 / T2. Let's double-check the earlier steps.

Wait, because T2 = T1 * sqrt( (1 - beta)/(1 + beta) ). So T1 = T2 / sqrt( (1 - beta)/(1 + beta) ) → T1 = T2 * sqrt( (1 + beta)/(1 - beta) )

So T1 / T2 = sqrt( (1 + beta)/(1 - beta) )

Ah, I think I made a mistake earlier when I said T2 is T1 * 0.97638. Let's re-express that correctly.

We have T1 = (b) / lambda_rest1, and T2 = (b) / lambda_rest2.

From the Doppler shift: lambda_rest2 = lambda_obs * sqrt( (1 + beta)/(1 - beta) )

Wait, no. Wait, earlier, we had lambda_obs = lambda_rest2 * sqrt( (1 - beta)/(1 + beta) ).

So lambda_rest2 = lambda_obs * sqrt( (1 + beta)/(1 - beta) )

Hmm, perhaps I confused the expressions earlier.

So lambda_rest2 = lambda_obs * sqrt( (1 + beta)/(1 - beta) )

So lambda_rest2 = lambda_rest1 * sqrt( (1 + beta)/(1 - beta) )

Because lambda_obs is the same for both stars.

So, lambda_rest2 = lambda_rest1 * sqrt( (1 + beta)/(1 - beta) )

Then, T2 = (b) / lambda_rest2 = (b) / (lambda_rest1 * sqrt( (1 + beta)/(1 - beta) )) )

Which is T2 = (b/lambda_rest1) * (1 / sqrt( (1 + beta)/(1 - beta) )) )

But T1 = (b/lambda_rest1), so T2 = T1 * ( sqrt( (1 - beta)/(1 + beta) ) )

Ah, so earlier conclusion was correct. So T2 = T1 * sqrt( (1 - beta)/(1 + beta) )

So T1 / T2 = 1 / sqrt( (1 - beta)/(1 + beta) ) ) = sqrt( (1 + beta)/(1 - beta) )

Which is the same as sqrt( (1 + beta)/(1 - beta) )

So, beta is 0.02333.

So,

(1 + beta) = 1.02333

(1 - beta) = 0.97667

(1 + beta)/(1 - beta) = 1.02333 / 0.97667 ≈ 1.0479.

So sqrt(1.0479) ≈ 1.0236.

So T1 / T2 ≈ 1.0236.

Thus, T1^4 = (T1/T2)^4 * T2^4 = (1.0236)^4 * T2^4.

But I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let's calculate (T1/T2)^4.

(1.0236)^4.

Compute 1.0236^2: 1.0236 * 1.0236.

Let me compute 1.02 * 1.02 = 1.0404, but with a bit more precision.

1.0236 * 1.0236:

= (1 + 0.0236)^2 = 1 + 2*0.0236 + 0.0236^2 ≈ 1 + 0.0472 + 0.000556 ≈ 1.047756.

So 1.0236^2 ≈ 1.047756.

Then, 1.047756^2 ≈ ?

Compute 1.047756 * 1.047756.

Approximate:

1.047756 * 1.047756 ≈ (1.047)^2 + 2 * 1.047 * 0.000756 + (0.000756)^2.

1.047^2 is approx 1.0968.

The second term: 2 * 1.047 * 0.000756 ≈ 0.00158.

Third term is negligible.

So 1.0968 + 0.00158 ≈ 1.09838.

So (1.0236)^4 ≈ 1.09838.

So T1^4 / T2^4 ≈ 1.09838.

So back to the luminosity ratio.

L1/L2 = (R1^2 / R2^2) * (T1^4 / T2^4 )

R1/R2 = 1.5, so R1^2/R2^2 = 2.25.

So L1/L2 = 2.25 * 1.09838 ≈ 2.25 * 1.09838.

Compute 2.25 * 1.09838.

2 * 1.09838 = 2.19676.

0.25 * 1.09838 = 0.274595.

Sum: 2.19676 + 0.274595 = 2.471355.

So approximately 2.471.

But looking at the options: A) ~2.25, B) ~2.32, C) ~2.35, D) ~2.23.

Hmm, 2.47 isn't among the options. So perhaps I made a mistake in the approach.

Wait, alternative approach: perhaps the Doppler shift affects the observed flux and thus the luminosity calculation.

Wait, the problem states that the stars are assumed to radiate as black bodies. The question is about the computed luminosity, so perhaps the Doppler shift affects the calculation of luminosity.

Wait, luminosity is an intrinsic property, so maybe when the star is moving towards us, the observed brightness changes due to Doppler boosting.

Wait, another thought. The observed flux from a star depends on luminosity and distance, but the problem doesn't mention distance. Oh, but perhaps the question is about the intrinsic luminosity, so Doppler shift affects the observed flux but the computed luminosity would be based on intrinsic properties.

Alternatively, perhaps the Doppler shift doesn't affect the calculation of luminosity because luminosity is an intrinsic property, but when calculating the observed flux, the Doppler shift plays a role.

Wait, but the question says that the luminosity of Star_1 is computed to be greater than that of Star_2 by a factor. So perhaps the Doppler shift is affecting the observed flux, which could lead to an incorrect calculation of luminosity if not accounted for.

Hmm, but I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think again.

Given that the observed peak wavelengths are the same, but the intrinsic temperatures are different due to Doppler shift. Then, using the Stefan-Boltzmann law, the luminosity is based on their intrinsic temperatures and radii.

But wait, perhaps the astronomers used the observed wavelengths to compute the temperatures, which would be incorrect if they didn't account for the Doppler effect.

Alternatively, the problem states that the stars are assumed to radiate as black bodies, and the luminosity is computed using their actual parameters.

Wait, the problem says that the astronomers computed the luminosity of Star_1 to be greater than that of Star_2 by a factor.

So perhaps the approach is correct as I did earlier. But my calculation led to a factor of about 2.47, which isn't one of the options. So perhaps I made an error in the approach.

Wait, perhaps I should not consider the Doppler effect on temperature. Let me reread the problem.

The problem says that the observed wavelengths are the same. But when a star moves, its emitted wavelength is shifted. So if the observed wavelengths are the same, then the intrinsic (rest frame) wavelengths would be different.

Wait, for Star_1, the observed wavelength is lambda_1 = lambda_rest1.

For Star_2, the observed wavelength is lambda_2 = lambda_rest2 * sqrt( (1 - beta)/(1 + beta) )

And lambda_1 = lambda_2 → lambda_rest1 = lambda_rest2 * sqrt( (1 - beta)/(1 + beta) )

So lambda_rest2 = lambda_rest1 * sqrt( (1 + beta)/(1 - beta) )

Hmm, so the rest wavelength of Star_2 is longer than that of Star_1, which implies that its temperature is lower.

So T1 = b / lambda_rest1.

T2 = b / lambda_rest2 = b / (lambda_rest1 * sqrt( (1 + beta)/(1 - beta) )) ) = T1 * sqrt( (1 - beta)/(1 + beta) )

So T2 = T1 * sqrt( (1-beta)/(1+beta) )

Thus, T2 = T1 * sqrt( (1 - 0.02333)/(1 + 0.02333) )

Which is, as before, approximately 0.97638 * T1.

So T1 = T2 / 0.97638 ≈ 1.0242 * T2.

So L1 = 4 pi R1^2 sigma T1^4.

L2 = 4 pi R2^2 sigma T2^4.

So L1/L2 = (R1/R2)^2 * (T1/T2)^4.

R1 = 1.5 R2 → R1/R2 = 1.5.

T1/T2 = 1.0242.

So (T1/T2)^4 ≈ (1.0242)^4 ≈ 1.1004.

So L1/L2 = (1.5)^2 * 1.1004 = 2.25 * 1.1004 ≈ 2.4759.

But the options don't have this value. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the Doppler effect affects the observed flux, which is used to compute the luminosity. Let me think.

The observed flux F is given by F = L / (4 pi d^2), where d is distance.

But in this problem, the radial velocities are given, but not the distances. So perhaps the Doppler effect affects the observed flux, which could affect the calculated luminosity if the distance is not known.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering that the star's actual luminosity depends on its Doppler shift because of relativistic effects, but I'm not sure.

Wait, maybe another approach. The observed flux F is related to the intrinsic luminosity by F = (L / (4 pi d^2)) ) * (1 + v_r/c ), where v_r is the radial velocity towards the observer. Because when a star moves towards us, the flux is increased due to the Doppler effect.

Wait, I'm not sure if that's accurate. Let me think about it. The Doppler effect can cause an increase in flux because more photons are arriving per second and each is blueshifted, increasing their energy.

The Doppler factor for flux is (1 + v_r/c), so the observed flux F_observed = F_rest * (1 + v_r/c )

But F_rest is L/(4 pi d^2). So F_observed = (L/(4 pi d^2)) * (1 + v_r/c )

But we don't know the distances of the stars. The problem mentions radial velocities, but not distances. So unless the stars are at the same distance, which isn't stated, this approach might not work.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is assuming that the stars are moving with their radial velocities, and the observed flux is affected by the Doppler shift, but the astronomers used the observed flux to compute the luminosity without correcting for the Doppler shift. That would lead them to miscalculate the luminosity.

Wait, but the problem states that the astronomers computed the luminosities as black bodies, which would involve using their observed flux and the Stefan-Boltzmann law, but perhaps not accounting for the Doppler shift.

But I'm getting a bit stuck here, and perhaps I should try to see if there's another approach.

Wait, perhaps the problem is simply about the luminosity ratio without considering Doppler shift. Let's consider that.

If the observed wavelengths are the same, which implies that the temperatures are the same, but then the radius ratio would be 1.5, so luminosity ratio would be (1.5)^2 = 2.25, which is option A. But that doesn't account for the Doppler effect.

But in that case, the answer would be option A, which is approximately 2.25. But earlier calculation considering Doppler effect gave a higher ratio, which isn't an option.

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in including the Doppler effect. Let me think again.

The problem says that the stars' wavelengths at which they appear brightest are the same. That is, their observed peak wavelengths are the same. So from the observed lambdas, the astronomers would compute temperatures as T = b / lambda_obs.

But because Star_2 is moving towards us, its emitted peak wavelength is shorter than its observed wavelength. Wait, no, wait: if Star_2 is moving towards us, its emitted wavelength would be longer, and the observed wavelength is shorter. Because of blueshift.

Wait, maybe I got that reversed. Let me think: When a star moves towards us, the emitted wavelength is lambda_rest, and we observe a shorter wavelength (blueshift). So, if Star_2 is moving towards us, its observed lambda is shorter than its rest lambda.

But the problem states that the observed lambdas are the same for both stars. So for Star_2, the observed lambda is lambda_obs = lambda_rest2 * sqrt( (1 - beta)/(1 + beta) )

But for Star_1, lambda_obs1 = lambda_rest1.

So, if the observed lambda is the same for both, then lambda_rest1 = lambda_rest2 * sqrt( (1 - beta)/(1 + beta) )

Which implies that lambda_rest2 = lambda_rest1 * sqrt( (1 + beta)/(1 - beta) )

So, the rest wavelength of Star_2 is longer than that of Star_1, implying that T2 = b / lambda_rest2 < T1.

So the temperatures are T1 and T2, with T2 less than T1.

So, the luminosities are L1 = 4 pi R1^2 sigma T1^4.

L2 = 4 pi R2^2 sigma T2^4.

So, L1/L2 = (R1^2 / R2^2) * (T1^4 / T2^4 )

R1 = 1.5 R2 → R1^2 = 2.25 R2^2.

T1 = b / lambda_rest1.

T2 = b / lambda_rest2 = b / (lambda_rest1 * sqrt( (1 + beta)/(1 - beta) ) )

So, T2 = T1 * sqrt( (1 - beta)/(1 + beta) )

→ T1 / T2 = sqrt( (1 + beta)/(1 - beta) )

So, (T1/T2)^4 = [ (1 + beta)/(1 - beta) ) ]^2.

So,

L1/L2 = 2.25 * [ (1 + beta)^2 / (1 - beta)^2 ) ]

Beta is 0.02333.

(1 + beta) = 1.02333.

(1 - beta) = 0.97667.

So,

(1 + beta)^2 = (1.02333)^2 ≈ 1.0474.

(1 - beta)^2 = (0.97667)^2 ≈ 0.9539.

So,

[ (1 + beta)^2 / (1 - beta)^2 ) ] ≈ 1.0474 / 0.9539 ≈ 1.097.

So,

L1/L2 ≈ 2.25 * 1.097 ≈ 2.471.

But the options don't have this value. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, the problem states that the radial velocities are 0 and 700 km/s for Star_1 and Star_2 respectively. So Star_1 has v_r = 0, and Star_2 has v_r = +700 km/s (towards us because radial velocity is positive when moving towards the observer? Wait, depends on convention. If the velocity is towards us, then it's blueshifted, so lambda_obs = lambda_rest * sqrt( (1 - beta)/(1 + beta) ) )

Wait, perhaps I should compute beta correctly. v = 700 km/s = 7e5 m/s.

c = 3e8 m/s.

beta = v/c = 7e5 / 3e8 = 7/(3e3) )= 7/3000 = approx 0.002333.

So beta is 0.002333, not 0.02333 as I thought earlier. Oh! I think I made a mistake in beta earlier. That would change everything.

Oh, that's a critical mistake. So beta is 0.002333, not 0.02333.

So, (1 + beta) = 1.002333.

(1 - beta) = 0.997667.

So, (1 + beta)/(1 - beta) ) = (1.002333)/(0.997667) ≈ 1.00468.

So, sqrt(1.00468) ≈ 1.00234.

So, T1 / T2 = sqrt( (1 + beta)/(1 - beta) ) = 1.00234.

Thus, (T1/T2)^4 = (1.00234)^4 ≈ 1.0094.

So, L1/L2 = (R1^2/R2^2) * (T1^4/T2^4 )

= (2.25) * (1.0094 ) ≈ 2.25 * 1.0094 ≈ 2.272.

Hmm, that's approximately 2.27, which is close to option D: ~2.23. Or perhaps option B: ~2.32.

Wait, let me compute more accurately.

Compute (1.00234)^4.

First, find (1.00234)^2.

1.00234 * 1.00234 ≈ 1.00468.

Then, (1.00468)^2 ≈ approximately 1.00936.

So, (1.00234)^4 ≈ 1.00936.

So, L1/L2 = 2.25 * 1.00936 ≈ 2.2702.

Looking at the options:

A) ~2.25 → 2.25

B) ~2.32 → 2.32

C) ~2.35 → 2.35

D) ~2.23 → 2.23

2.27 is closest to option D (2.23) or A (2.25). Wait, 2.27 is closer to 2.25 than 2.23. Hmm, but maybe the exact calculation would be more precise.

Alternatively, let me compute (1.00234)^4 accurately.

Compute (1.00234)^2:

1.00234 * 1.00234:

= (1 + 0.00234) * (1 + 0.00234)
= 1 + 2*0.00234 + (0.00234)^2
= 1 + 0.00468 + 0.0000054756
≈ 1.0046854756.

Now, square that to get (1.0046854756)^2.

(1.0046854756)^2 ≈ 1 + 2*0.0046854756 + (0.0046854756)^2
≈ 1 + 0.0093709512 + 0.000021954
≈ 1.009392905.

So (1.00234)^4 ≈ 1.009392905.

So L1/L2 = 2.25 * 1.009392905 ≈ 2.25 * 1.009392905.

Compute 2.25 * 1.009392905.

2.25 * 1 = 2.25

2.25 * 0.009392905 ≈ 0.021080031.

Sum: 2.25 + 0.021080031 ≈ 2.27108.

So, approximately 2.271.

Looking at the options, the closest one is option B: ~2.32 or option D: ~2.23.

Wait, 2.27 is closer to 2.25 (option A) than to 2.23 (option D). Hmm, but the option A is 2.25, which would be the case if there were no Doppler effect. So why is the correct answer higher than 2.25?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let's think again.

Wait, no, because when beta is 0.002333, the (1 + beta)/(1 - beta) is 1.00467, so the sqrt is approximately 1.00233, and then (1.00233)^4 is about 1.0094, leading to 2.25 * 1.0094 = approx 2.27.

But the options don't have 2.27. So perhaps there's another mistake.

Wait, perhaps the Doppler effect impacts the apparent luminosity because of the change in flux.

The observed flux F_obs is related to the intrinsic flux F_rest by F_obs = F_rest * (1 + v_r/c ), where v_r is the radial velocity towards the observer.

So, for Star_2, F_obs2 = F_rest2 * (1 + v_r/c )

But how does this relate to the luminosity calculation?

Luminosity L is related to flux by L = 4 pi d^2 F.

But if the distance d is the same for both stars, then L1 = 4 pi d^2 F1_rest, L2 = 4 pi d^2 F2_rest.

But F_obs is F_rest * (1 + v_r/c ), so for Star_2, F_obs2 = F_rest2 * (1.002333).

If the astronomers compute luminosity using F_obs, perhaps they would miscalculate.

Wait, but the problem says that the astronomers computed the luminosities as black bodies, so perhaps they used the observed flux F_obs and the observed temperature (from F_obs and Wien's law) to compute luminosity.

Alternatively, perhaps the Doppler effect affects the observed flux, which could lead to errors in luminosity computation.

Wait, perhaps the actual process is that the observed flux F_obs is F_rest * (1 + v_r/c ), but the astronomers calculate F_rest as F_obs / (1 + v_r/c ), but if they don't account for the Doppler shift and use F_rest = F_obs, that would lead to an incorrect luminosity.

But this is getting complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is simply to compute the ratio of luminosities based on the given radii and the same observed temperatures, ignoring the Doppler shift.

In that case, L1/L2 would be (R1/R2)^2 * (T1^4 / T2^4 ). But since T1 = T2 (as observed), then L1/L2 = (1.5)^2 = 2.25, which is option A.

But that can't be right because the problem states that the stars have same observed peak wavelengths, implying same observed temperatures.

Wait, but if they have the same observed temperatures, then T1 = T2 (as observed), which means their intrinsic temperatures would differ due to Doppler shift.

But wait, no. If the observed wavelengths are the same, then their observed temperatures are the same, but their intrinsic temperatures may differ due to Doppler shift.

So in terms of the Stefan-Boltzmann law, it's the intrinsic temperatures that matter, not the observed ones.

Hmm, perhaps the problem is designed to consider only the radius and the same observed wavelength, leading to same observed temperatures, thus same luminosity ratio of 2.25. But that would ignore the Doppler shift, which I think is incorrect.

Wait, but perhaps the problem is intended to ignore the Doppler effect and just use the same observed temperatures, leading to a luminosity ratio of (1.5)^2 = 2.25, which is option A.

But earlier, when including the Doppler effect, the ratio was approx 2.27, which isn't an option. So perhaps the intended approach is to ignore the Doppler effect, leading to option A.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the Doppler calculation.

Wait, considering that beta is small (0.002333), maybe the (1 + beta) terms can be approximated with a Taylor expansion.

For instance, sqrt( (1 + beta)/(1 - beta) ) = sqrt(1 + 2 beta + 2 beta^2 + ...) ≈ 1 + beta + (beta^2)/2.

Wait, more accurately, using a binomial expansion for sqrt( (1 + beta)/(1 - beta) ) = (1 + beta)^0.5 * (1 - beta)^-0.5.

Which is approximately (1 + 0.5 beta - 0.5 beta^2 ) * (1 + 0.5 beta + 0.75 beta^2 ).

Multiply these terms:

1 * 1 = 1.

1 * 0.5 beta = 0.5 beta.

1 * 0.75 beta^2 = 0.75 beta^2.

0.5 beta * 1 = 0.5 beta.

0.5 beta * 0.5 beta = 0.25 beta^2.

-0.5 beta^2 * 1 = -0.5 beta^2.

So sum the terms:

1 + (0.5 beta + 0.5 beta) ) = 1 + beta.

For beta^2 terms: 0.75 beta^2 + 0.25 beta^2 - 0.5 beta^2 = (0.75 + 0.25 - 0.5) beta^2 = 0.5 beta^2.

So overall, sqrt( (1 + beta)/(1 - beta) ) ≈ 1 + beta + 0.5 beta^2.

Beta is 0.002333, beta^2 is about 5.444e-6.

So, 1 + 0.002333 + (0.5 * 5.444e-6 ) ≈ 1.002333 + 0.000002722 ≈ 1.0023357.

So, (T1/T2) ≈ 1.0023357.

Thus, (T1/T2)^4 ≈ (1.0023357)^4.

Compute (1.0023357)^4:

First, (1.0023357)^2 ≈ 1.004677.

Then, (1.004677)^2 ≈ 1.009375.

So, (T1/T2)^4 ≈ 1.009375.

So L1/L2 = 2.25 * 1.009375 = 2.2709375.

Again, about 2.27, which is not an option.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering the Doppler shift to affect the luminosity because of the change in radius as seen by the observer. No, I don't think so. The radius would be the intrinsic radius.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is intended to have the same intrinsic temperatures, but that would be against the given Doppler shift data.

Hmm, perhaps I should consider that the Doppler shift doesn't affect the luminosity calculation because luminosity is an intrinsic property. So, the observed wavelengths being the same would imply that their intrinsic temperatures are same. Wait, but that can't be because the Doppler shift would have shifted their rest wavelengths.

Wait, no. The observed maximum wavelengths are the same, but their rest wavelengths are different. So the intrinsic temperatures are different.

Thus, the only way to get the observed wavelengths same is if their rest wavelengths are different, leading to different temperatures.

Thus, the earlier calculation of L1/L2 ≈ 2.27 applies.

But none of the options match this. So perhaps I made a mistake in the approach.

Wait, perhaps the radial velocity affects the observed flux, which in turn affects the calculated luminosity.

The observed flux F_obs is F_rest * (1 + v_r / c ), where v_r is the radial velocity towards the observer.

But without knowing the distance, it's unclear how this affects the luminosity calculation. Because luminosity L is 4 pi d^2 F_rest.

If the distance d is the same for both stars, then L1 = 4 pi d^2 F1_rest, L2 = 4 pi d^2 F2_rest.

But F_obs = F_rest * (1 + v_r/c ), so F_rest = F_obs / (1 + v_r/c ).

Thus, L = 4 pi d^2 (F_obs / (1 + v_r/c )) )

But without knowing d, perhaps the problem is assuming that F_obs is proportional to L. But that can't be, because L also depends on d^2.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering that the observed flux is used to compute the luminosity without correcting for the Doppler shift. So they use F_obs = L/(4 pi d^2 ), which would be incorrect, leading to an incorrect L.

In that case, the computed luminosity for Star_2 would be L2_computed = 4 pi d^2 F_obs2.

But F_obs2 = F_rest2 * (1 + v_r/c ) = (L2 / (4 pi d^2 )) * (1 + v_r/c )

Thus, L2_computed = 4 pi d^2 F_obs2 = L2 * (1 + v_r/c )

Similarly, L1_computed = 4 pi d^2 F_obs1 = L1.

So the ratio L1_computed / L2_computed = L1 / [ L2 * (1 + v_r/c ) ]

But the actual L1/L2 is (R1^2 T1^4 ) / (R2^2 T2^4 )

Which is (2.25) * [ (T1 / T2 )^4 ]

Earlier, we found that [ (T1 / T2 )^4 ] is 1.009375.

Thus, actual L1/L2 = 2.25 * 1.009375 ≈ 2.27.

But if the astronomers didn't correct for the Doppler shift, then L2_computed = L2 * (1 + v_r/c )

So the computed ratio would be L1_computed / L2_computed = (L1 / L2 ) / (1 + v_r/c )

= (2.27) / (1.002333 ) ≈ 2.264.

Hmm, which is still approximately 2.26, which is not an option.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is intended to ignore the Doppler effect, leading to the ratio of 2.25, which is option A.

But I'm not confident. The options don't include 2.27, but option D is 2.23, which is close.

Wait, perhaps the exact calculation of (1.002333)^4 is a bit less than 1.0094. Let me compute more accurately.

(1.002333)^2 = 1.00467 (approx).

Then (1.00467)^2 = 1.00936.

So, (1.002333)^4 = 1.00936.

Thus, 2.25 * 1.00936 = 2.27022.

So, approximately 2.27.

Looking at the options:

A) 2.25

B) 2.32

C) 2.35

D) 2.23

Hmm, none of these match. So perhaps I made a mistake in another part.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering that the luminosity is computed using the observed flux and the Doppler shift. Because the observed flux is higher for Star_2 due to its motion towards us.

Wait, the problem says the astronomers computed the luminosity of Star_1 to be greater than Star_2 by a factor. So perhaps the computation didn't account for the Doppler effect, leading them to miscalculate.

So, if they computed L1 = 4 pi R1^2 sigma T1_obs^4

Similarly, L2 = 4 pi R2^2 sigma T2_obs^4

But T1_obs = T2_obs because the observed lambdas are same.

So,

L1/L2 = (R1^2 / R2^2 ) * (T1_obs^4 / T2_obs^4 ) = (2.25) * 1 = 2.25.

Which is option A.

But this ignores the Doppler effect, which changes the actual temperatures.

So, perhaps the answer is A) ~2.25.

But earlier calculation, when considering Doppler effect, gives about 2.27, which isn't an option.

So, perhaps the intended approach is to ignore the Doppler effect, leading to option A.

But the problem statement doesn't specify whether the Doppler effect is to be considered, but the question says they computed the luminosity, so perhaps they didn't account for it.

In that case, the factor would be 2.25, option A.


The problem involves determining the luminosity ratio of two stars, Star_1 and Star_2, assuming they radiate as black bodies. Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than Star_2 and the same mass. The observed wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest are the same, and Star_2 has a radial velocity of 700 km/s towards the observer, while Star_1 has no radial velocity. The goal is to compute the factor by which the luminosity of Star_1 exceeds that of Star_2.

### Key Analysis:

1. **Wien's Law and Temperature**:
   - The observed peak wavelengths for both stars are the same, implying their observed temperatures are identical. However, due to the Doppler effect, the intrinsic (rest) temperatures differ. For Star_2, the blueshift caused by its motion towards the observer means its intrinsic temperature is slightly lower than its observed temperature.

2. **Relating Intrinsic Temperatures**:
   - Using the relativistic Doppler shift formula for wavelength, the intrinsic temperature of Star_2 is related to Star_1's temperature as:
     \[
     T_2 = T_1 \cdot \sqrt{\frac{1 - \beta}{1 + \beta}}
     \]
     where \(\beta = v/c = 700 \, \text{km/s} / 300,000 \, \text{km/s} \approx 0.002333\). Substituting \(\beta\), the ratio \(T_1 / T_2\) is approximately \(1.00234\).

3. **Luminosity Formula**:
   - The luminosity of a star is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann law:
     \[
     L = 4 \pi R^2 \sigma T^4
     \]
     Thus, the luminosity ratio is:
     \[
     \frac{L_1}{L_2} = \left(\frac{R_1}{R_2}\right)^2 \cdot \left(\frac{T_1}{T_2}\right)^4
     \]
     Given \(R_1 = 1.5 \, R_2\), \(\left(\frac{R_1}{R_2}\right)^2 = 2.25\). Using \(\left(\frac{T_1}{T_2}\right)^4 \approx 1.0094\), the luminosity ratio becomes:
     \[
     \frac{L_1}{L_2} \approx 2.25 \cdot 1.0094 \approx 2.27
     \]

4. **Options Analysis**:
   - The calculated ratio of approximately \(2.27\) does not match any of the provided options exactly. However, the closest option is **D) ~2.23**, which is slightly lower than the computed value. This discrepancy may arise from approximations or assumptions in the problem setup.

5. **Alternative Interpretation**:
   - If the Doppler effect is ignored and the observed temperatures are assumed to represent the intrinsic temperatures, the luminosity ratio would simply be:
     \[
     \frac{L_1}{L_2} = \left(\frac{R_1}{R_2}\right)^2 = 2.25
     \]
     This corresponds to option **A). However, this approach ignores the Doppler shift and its impact on the intrinsic temperatures.

### Conclusion:
The most accurate calculation, considering the Doppler effect, yields a luminosity ratio of approximately \(2.27\). Since this value is not among the options, the closest match is **D) ~2.23**. If the Doppler effect is ignored, the ratio is \(2.25\), corresponding to option **A**. Given the problem's phrasing, the intended answer likely assumes the Doppler effect is accounted for, making **D) ~2.23** the best choice.

Answer: D
