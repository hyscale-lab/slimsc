Okay, I'm trying to solve this physics problem. Let me read it again. So, a light beam is propagating through a glass with index of refraction n. The glass is moving at a constant velocity v in the same direction as the beam and towards the observer in the laboratory. The question is asking for the speed of light in the glass relative to the observer in the lab. And the speed of light in a vacuum is given as c=1.

Hmm, I remember that when dealing with relative velocities, especially involving light, I should probably think about special relativity. Because light's speed in a vacuum is constant in all inertial frames, but wait, this is in a medium, not a vacuum. Oh right, so the speed of light in a medium depends on the medium's properties.

Wait, but the glass is moving. So the speed of light in the glass from the lab frame's perspective might be affected by the movement of the glass. I'm a bit fuzzy on how that works.

First, the speed of light in the glass when it's at rest is c/n, right? Because the index of refraction n is c divided by the speed of light in the medium. So normally, v_light = c/n.

But now the glass is moving at velocity v in the same direction as the light beam. So from the lab frame, how does that affect the light's speed?

Wait, maybe I should think about how velocities add in relativity. The standard velocity addition formula is (u + v)/(1 + (u*v)/c²). But this formula applies when you're transforming between two inertial frames moving at speed v relative to each other. But wait, in this scenario, the glass is moving, but the light is moving through the glass. So is the situation more complicated?

Alternatively, perhaps I can consider the glass as a medium moving at velocity v. So the light's speed in the medium would be c/n, but as observed from the lab frame, it might be different because the medium itself is moving.

Wait, but in the lab frame, the glass is moving. So the light is moving through the glass, which is itself moving. So the light's speed in the lab frame would be the speed of the light in the glass plus the speed of the glass, perhaps? But that's only the case in classical mechanics. Special relativity says you can't just add velocities like that.

So in special relativity, velocities don't add linearly. So if the light's speed in the glass is u in the glass's frame, then in the lab frame, moving at velocity v relative to the glass (since the glass is moving towards the observer), the light's speed would be (u + v)/(1 + (u v)/(c²)).

Wait, wait, no. Wait, in the glass's rest frame, the light is moving at u = c/n. The glass is moving at velocity v relative to the lab. So to find the lab frame's measurement of the light's speed, we apply the velocity addition formula.

So the formula is (u + v)/(1 + (u v)/(c²)) because the lab is moving at velocity v relative to the glass (if the glass is moving at v towards the observer, then the lab would see the glass moving at v, and the light in the glass would have u as observed in the glass's frame).

Wait, no, I think I might have that reversed. Let's think: the glass is moving at v relative to the lab. So in the lab frame, the glass's velocity is v. The light's speed in the glass's frame is u = c/n. So, to find the light's speed in the lab frame, we apply the velocity addition formula.

Wait, velocity addition in relativity is given by (u' + v)/(1 + (u' v)/(c^2)), where u' is the velocity in the moving frame (glass's frame), and v is the speed of the moving frame relative to the lab. So u' is c/n, and v is the speed of the glass relative to the lab, which is v. So substituting, we get ( (c/n) + v ) / (1 + ( (c/n)*v )/(c²) )

Simplify that denominator: (c^2) in the denominator. So (c/n * v) / c² = (v/(n c)).

So the denominator becomes 1 + v/(n c).

The numerator is (c/n + v).

So the entire expression is [ ( c/n + v ) ] / [ 1 + (v)/(n c) ) ]

Hmm, let's write that as [ (1/n + v c^{-1} ) * c ] / [ (1 + v/(n c) ) ]

Wait, maybe I should factor out 1/n. Let me see:

Numerator: (c + n v ) / n

Denominator: (n c + v ) / (n c )

Wait, because 1 + v/(n c) = (n c + v )/(n c )

So putting it together: [ (c + n v)/n ] / [ (n c + v )/(n c) ) ]

Which is equal to [ (c +n v ) /n ] * [ n c / (n c + v) ) ]

The n in the denominator and numerator cancels.

So it becomes (c + n v ) * c / (n c + v )

Wait, but wait, the denominator is (n c + v). The numerator is (c +n v) times c.

So let me write that as c(c + n v) / (n c + v)

But wait, let me factor out n from the denominator. So n c + v = n (c) + v.

Alternatively, let me factor n from the denominator and numerator if possible.

Wait, perhaps this can be simplified further. Let me see:

Wait, let's take the expression as (c +n v ) * c / (n c + v )

I can factor out n from denominator: n (c) + v = n ( c + (v/(n)) )

Wait, but not sure if that helps. Let me consider factoring.

Wait, perhaps the numerator is c (c + n v) and denominator is (n c + v) = (c n + v). So the expression is [c(c + n v)] / (c n + v).

Wait, maybe that's as simplified as it gets. Let me see if that's any of the options.

Looking at the options:

Option A: (1 +n v)/(n +v )

Wait, but wait, our current expression is [c(c +n v)]/(n c +v). But in the problem, c is taken as 1. So substituting c=1, the expression becomes [1*(1 +n v)]/(n *1 + v) = (1 +n v)/(n +v ), which is option A.

Hmm, that seems correct.

Wait, but wait a minute. Let me make sure I'm not mixing up the reference frames.

The glass is moving towards the observer in the lab. So the velocity v is towards the observer. The light is moving in the same direction as the glass's motion. So in the glass's frame, the light is moving at c/n. Then, when the glass is moving at v relative to the lab, the observed speed would be (u + v)/(1 + uv/c²), where u is c/n. So yes, that gives the same result as before.

So substituting c=1, it becomes ( (1/n) + v ) / (1 + (v/(n)) )

But wait, no. Wait, u is c/n, which when c=1, is 1/n. So the velocity addition is (u + v) / (1 + u v )

So plug in u = 1/n: (1/n + v ) / (1 + (1/n)*v )

Multiply numerator and denominator by n to eliminate the denominator:

Numerator: 1 + n v

Denominator: n (1) + v

So the expression becomes (1 + n v )/(n + v ), which is option A.

So the correct answer should be option A.

Wait, but another thought: in the lab frame, the glass is moving towards the observer. The light is moving in the same direction as the glass's velocity. So the lab is moving relative to the glass at speed v. Wait, no, the lab is the stationary frame, and the glass is moving at v. So the glass is moving towards the observer, and the light is moving in the same direction as the glass's motion.

So the scenario is that the light is moving in the same direction as the glass's motion. So when calculating the speed in the lab frame, we add the glass's velocity to the light's speed in the glass frame, but using the relativistic formula.

So yes, the calculation seems correct. So the answer should be option A.


To determine the speed of light in the glass relative to the observer in the laboratory, we consider the following:

1. **Speed of light in the glass (rest frame of the glass):**  
   The speed of light in a medium is given by \( u = \frac{c}{n} \), where \( c \) is the speed of light in a vacuum and \( n \) is the index of refraction of the glass. Since \( c = 1 \) in this problem, the speed of light in the glass is \( u = \frac{1}{n} \).

2. **Relativistic velocity addition:**  
   The glass is moving at a constant velocity \( v \) in the same direction as the light beam and toward the observer. To find the speed of light in the glass relative to the lab frame, we use the relativistic velocity addition formula:  
   \[
   u_{\text{lab}} = \frac{u + v}{1 + \frac{u v}{c^2}}
   \]  
   Substituting \( u = \frac{1}{n} \) and \( c = 1 \), this becomes:  
   \[
   u_{\text{lab}} = \frac{\frac{1}{n} + v}{1 + \frac{v}{n}}
   \]

3. **Simplification:**  
   Multiply the numerator and denominator by \( n \) to eliminate the fraction:  
   \[
   u_{\text{lab}} = \frac{1 + n v}{n + v}
   \]

4. **Comparison with options:**  
   The derived expression matches option **A**, which is \( \frac{1 + n v}{n + v} \).

Thus, the speed of light in the glass relative to the observer in the laboratory is given by option A.
