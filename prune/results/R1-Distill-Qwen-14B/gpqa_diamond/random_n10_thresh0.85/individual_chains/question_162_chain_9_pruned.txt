Okay, so I have this question about a metric and finding the area of a pseudosphere with radius r=2. Hmm, let's try to break this down. I'm a bit rusty on my differential geometry, but I'll think it through.

First, the metric given is ds² = (32)/(4 - x² - y²) (dx² + dy²). Wait, that looks kind of familiar. It reminds me of metrics for spaces with constant curvature. Oh right, the metric for a sphere in 2D usually has a term like (1/(R² - r²)) where r is the radial coordinate, but I might be mixing things up.

Wait, the metric is in terms of x and y, so it's in a 2D coordinate system. Let me think: what kind of geometry does this metric represent? The denominator is (4 - x² - y²), which looks like 4 minus r² if r is the radial coordinate (r² = x² + y²). So 4 - r². Then the metric has a factor of 32/(4 - r²) multiplied by (dx² + dy²). So ds² = [32/(4 - r²)] (dr² + r² dθ²), if I switch to polar coordinates. Wait, no, maybe not. Because in the original, it's dx² + dy², so if r² = x² + y², then dx² + dy² = dr² + r² dθ². So the ds² becomes (32/(4 - r²)) (dr² + r² dθ²). That seems like a metric for a sphere with some radius.

Wait, but the question is about a pseudosphere. Oh, right, a pseudosphere is a surface of constant negative curvature. Oh, wait, no. Wait, I'm getting confused. So a sphere is a surface of constant positive curvature, and a pseudosphere (like a tractricoid) is a surface of constant negative curvature.

Wait, but the metric given here—what kind of curvature does it have? Let me think about the form of the metric. For a surface of revolution, if it's a sphere, the metric is usually (R² - r²)/(R²) dr² + r² dθ², but I'm not sure. Alternatively, for a hyperbolic space, the metric might have a different form.

Wait, the general metric for a 2D surface of constant curvature is usually written as ds² = (dr² + r² dθ²)/(1 - k r²), where k is the curvature. But wait, for positive curvature (sphere), the denominator is 1 - k r², leading to a sphere of radius 1/sqrt(k). Hmm, but in the given problem, the denominator is 4 - (x² + y²) = 4 - r². So perhaps comparing to the standard metric, the denominator is (4 - r²) = (4)(1 - (r²/4)). So it's like 4 times (1 - (r²/4)), which would imply that the curvature is -1/(4), because for a hyperbolic metric, it's 1/(a²)(dr² + ...), but wait, maybe I should think differently.

Wait, the standard metric for hyperbolic space in 2D is ds² = (dr² + r² dθ²)/(1 - (k r²)), where k is the negative curvature. Alternatively, sometimes written as ds² = (dr² + r² dθ²)/(k (a² - r²)), but I might be getting the exact form wrong. Alternatively, perhaps it's better to compute the Gaussian curvature from the given metric.

So, the given metric is ds² = (32)/(4 - r²) (dr² + r² dθ²), since we can switch to polar coordinates. Let's denote the metric as ds² = A(r) (dr² + r² dθ²), where A(r) = 32/(4 - r²).

For a metric of the form ds² = (dr² + r² dθ²) / (E(r)), the Gaussian curvature K is given by K = - (1/(2 E)) d/d r (E(r)). Wait, is that right? Wait, the formula for Gaussian curvature in polar coordinates is: 

K = - [1/(2 E(r))] * d/dr (E(r) * (1/r)) ) * (1/r²) ? Hmm, maybe I should recall the correct formula.

Alternatively, the Gaussian curvature can be found using the formula:

K = - (1/(2 A)) * d/dr (A(r) / r )

Wait, no, perhaps it's better to use the formula for K in terms of the metric components. The metric is diagonal, so g_rr = A(r), g_θθ = A(r) r². The Gaussian curvature for a metric in polar coordinates is given by:

K = -(1/(2 g_rr)) [ (g_θθ)''_r / r - (g_θθ)'_r / (2 r) + (g_θθ)/(2 r²) ) ]

Wait, maybe I should look for a more straightforward approach. Alternatively, another method: for a metric ds² = (dr² + r² dθ²) / f(r), the curvature K is given by K = - (1/(2 f(r))) * [ (f'(r) ) / r + (f'(r))/r ].

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me compute K using the formula for a metric in 2D:

K = - (1/(2)) * [ (g_rr)''_θ - (g_θθ)''_r + ... ] but wait, since the metric is in polar coordinates and is diagonal, perhaps a different formula is better.

Wait, another approach: For a metric ds² = a(r)^2 (dr² + r² dθ²), the Gaussian curvature is K = - (a'(r) )/(a(r) r) ). Wait, is that right?

Wait, no, I think I'm getting this mixed up. Let me think about the standard metric for a sphere. The metric in spherical coordinates is ds² = R² (dθ² + sin²θ dφ²). But in that case, the curvature is positive, K = 1/R².

Alternatively, for hyperbolic space in Poincaré coordinates, the metric is ds² = (dx² + dy²)/(x² + y²), which has constant negative curvature, K = -1.

Wait, if the given metric is ds² = 32/(4 - r²) (dr² + r² dθ²), then comparing to the standard hyperbolic metric, which is ds² = (dr² + r² dθ²)/(a² - r²), perhaps? Or maybe it's scaled differently.

Wait, let me think about scaling. The given metric has a function of (4 - r²) in the denominator, multiplied by 32. Let me write it as:

ds² = [32 / (4 - r²)] (dr² + r² dθ²)

I can factor out the 32 as a squared term. Let me see: 32 = (4√2)^2 / (2^2) maybe? Not sure.

Alternatively, let me compute the Gaussian curvature for this metric. Because the area of the pseudosphere (which is a surface of constant negative curvature) would relate to the Gaussian curvature.

The formula for Gaussian curvature K for a metric ds² = A(r) (dr² + r² dθ²) is:

K = - (1/(2 A)) * d/dr ( A(r) )

Wait, perhaps that's the formula. Let me check. Because from what I remember, for the metric ds² = (dr² + r² dθ²)/f(r), the Gaussian curvature is K = - (1/(2 f)) * [
