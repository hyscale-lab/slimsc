Okay, so I'm looking at this physics problem here, and I need to figure out the kinematically allowed decays of a boson X. The mass of X is given as 6 GeV. Let me try to understand what the question is asking.

The Lagrangian is provided: L(y) = -λf \barψ_f (y) (υ + X(y)) ψ_f(y). Hmm, wait, I think maybe that's a typo. Because usually, the Yukawa interaction is something like L = g ψ̄ ψ X, right? So perhaps the actual Lagrangian is L = λ \barψ_f (y) X(y) ψ_f(y), but that's just my thought. So the interaction term is proportional to X ψ ψ. So this tells me that the boson X couples to fermion-antifermion pairs.

So, the decay of X would be into a fermion and an antifermion. The possible decays would be any fermions for which the mass of X is sufficient to produce the pair. Because, remember, for a decay to be possible, the mass of the boson must be at least twice the mass of the fermion. Because E = mc², so the rest mass energy of the fermion times 2 (since you produce two of them) must be less than or equal to the mass of X.

So X's mass is 6 GeV. Let me list the masses of all the known fermions. The up, down, strange, and charm quarks are lighter, while the bottom and top are heavier. The tau lepton is also heavier, and the muon and electron are lighter.

Wait, let's get the masses right. I think:

- Electron (e): ~0.511 MeV (so 0.000511 GeV)
- Muon (μ): ~105.7 MeV (0.1057 GeV)
- Tau (τ): ~1.777 GeV
- Up quark (u): around 2-5 MeV (so 0.002 to 0.005 GeV)
- Down quark (d): ~4-8 MeV (0.004 to 0.008 GeV)
- Strange quark (s): ~95-105 MeV (0.095 to 0.105 GeV)
- Charm quark (c): ~1.2-1.5 GeV
- Bottom quark (b): ~4.1-4.7 GeV
- Top quark (t): way heavier, about 173 GeV

Wait, but wait a second. The X boson has a mass of 6 GeV. So when it decays into fermions, the sum of the fermion masses must be less than or equal to 6 GeV.

Let me think about the possible fermion pairs:

1. Electron-positron (e+ e-): each about 0.511 MeV. So 2 * 0.000511 GeV = 0.001022 GeV. That's way below 6 GeV. So allowed.

2. Muon pair (μ+ μ-): each about 0.1057 GeV, so 2 * 0.1057 ~ 0.2114 GeV. Also allowed.

3. Tau pair (τ+ τ-): each about 1.777 GeV, so 2 * 1.777 ~ 3.554 GeV. That's less than 6 GeV; allowed.

4. Up quark pair (u ū): each around 2-5 MeV, so 2*(0.002 to 0.005)=0.004 to 0.01 GeV. Allowed.

5. Down quark pair (d d̄): each ~4-8 MeV. 2*(0.004 to 0.008) = 0.008 to 0.016 GeV. Allowed.

6. Strange quark pair (s s̄): each ~95-105 MeV. 2*(0.095 to 0.105) = 0.19 to 0.21 GeV. Allowed.

7. Charm quark pair (c c̄): each ~1.2-1.5 GeV. 2*1.2=2.4 GeV, 2*1.5=3 GeV. Wait, 2.4 is less than 6. So allowed.

What about bottom quarks? (b b̄): each about
