Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the right reagents. Let's see what it says. The question has two reactions, and I need to choose the suitable reagents A and B from the options given.

First reaction: butan-2-one + NaCN + A → 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Hmm, wait, butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO. Adding NaCN—that's sodium cyanide. I remember that when ketones react with HCN, they undergo addition. But wait, NaCN is a source of CN- ions. So maybe it's a nucleophilic addition.

Wait, but butan-2-one is a ketone. So perhaps this is a nucleophilic addition of CN- to the carbonyl group. The product is a nitrile with a hydroxyl group. Wait, but the product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Let me draw the structures.

Butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO. The product is CH2(CO2H)(CN)CH3? No, wait, the product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Let's see: the formula would be (CH3)2C(OH)CH2CN? Wait no, butanenitrile is four carbons with the nitrile group. So 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile would be something like (CH3)2C(OH)CH2CN. Wait, that's five carbons? No, butanenitrile is four carbons, so maybe the structure is (CH3)2C(OH)CH2CN? Wait, I'm a bit confused.

Wait, butanenitrile is NC-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3, but in this case, the product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. So the structure must be: the nitrile group is at the end, and on the second carbon, there's a hydroxyl and a methyl group.
