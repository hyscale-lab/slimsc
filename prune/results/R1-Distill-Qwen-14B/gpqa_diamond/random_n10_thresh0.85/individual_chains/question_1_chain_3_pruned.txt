Alright, so I've got this quantum mechanics question here. Hmm, okay, let me try to think through it. The question is about two quantum states with energies E1 and E2. Their lifetimes are given as 10^-9 seconds and 10^-8 seconds respectively. The goal is to find their energy difference so that they can be clearly resolved. The options are A to D.

Wait, I remember something about the uncertainty principle here. Oh right, the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle. It states that you can't simultaneously know both the energy and the lifetime of a particle with infinite precision. The product of the uncertainty in energy (ΔE) and the uncertainty in time (Δt) is at least ħ/2, where ħ is the reduced Planck's constant. So, ΔE * Δt ≈ ħ.

The formula I think is ΔE ≈ ħ / Δt. Since the lifetime here is the time uncertainty (Δt), this would give us the minimum energy uncertainty. If the energy difference between the two states is larger than this uncertainty, we can distinguish them.

Let me get the numbers straight. The lifetimes are 1e-9 and 1e-8 seconds. Wait, but which one's which? Oh, the question gives E1 and E2 with their respective lifetimes. But for the energy difference, I think we need to consider the uncertainty related to each state. Or perhaps, wait, maybe the energy difference should be greater than the sum of the uncertainties of each state? Or maybe each state contributes its own uncertainty, and the overall uncertainty is the sum?

Wait, perhaps I should think of the energy difference being detectable if it's larger than the uncertainty in energy for each state. So the energy difference ΔE should be greater than the uncertainty from each state. So I need to calculate the uncertainty for each and ensure that ΔE is larger than both.

Alternatively, perhaps the overall uncertainty when measuring the energy difference would be the sum of the uncertainties from each state. Hmm, I'm a bit confused here.

Let me think again. The Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle says that ΔE * Δt ≥ ħ/2. So, for each state, the uncertainty in energy is ħ/(2Δt). Let's compute that.

But wait, what's the value of ħ? Planck's constant h is approximately 6.626e-34 J·s. Since ħ is h/(2π), so ħ ≈ 1.055e-34 J·s.

Let me compute the uncertainty in energy for each state.

For the first state, lifetime Δt1 = 1e-9 s.

ΔE1 ≈ ħ /
