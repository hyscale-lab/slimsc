Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this physics problem, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll go through it step by step. Let me read the question again.

So, we have an uncharged spherical conductor with radius R. Inside it, there's a small spherical cavity. The center of the cavity is a distance s from the center of the conductor, and the radius of the cavity is r, which is less than R. Then, a small positive charge +q is placed inside this cavity. The question is asking about the electric field at a point P outside the conductor. Point P is a distance L from the center of the conductor, and the distance from P to the center of the cavity is l. Both l and L are greater than R. The angle between l and s is theta.

Hmm. I remember that when charges are placed inside a cavity of a conductor, the conductor's induced charges affect the electric field outside. But wait, the conductor was initially uncharged. So, when the charge +q is placed inside, the conductor's inner surface would induce an equal and opposite charge, right? Or wait, maybe that's when a charge is outside the cavity.

Wait, no. Let me think. For a conductor with a cavity, if the cavity is uncharged initially, placing a charge inside would induce opposite charges on the inner surface of the conductor. Because the conductor was neutral, the inner surface would have -q, and the outer surface would have +q to balance it out. But wait, that's when the conductor is neutral and a charge is placed inside the cavity. So in this case, the conductor's total charge is zero, so the inner surface must have -q and the outer surface +q.

But wait, wait. The conductor is uncharged, so the sum of all charges on the conductor must be zero. So the inner surface will have -q (since the cavity has +q), and the outer surface would have +q to cancel it. Wait, no. The conductor's initial charge is zero. So when you put +q in the cavity, the inner surface of the conductor (the part near the cavity) would have -q to balance the field inside the conductor. Because the conductor is a conductor, the charges move to cancel the internal fields. So the inner surface must have -q, and then the outer surface must have +q to keep the total charge of the conductor at zero.

So the conductor as a whole
