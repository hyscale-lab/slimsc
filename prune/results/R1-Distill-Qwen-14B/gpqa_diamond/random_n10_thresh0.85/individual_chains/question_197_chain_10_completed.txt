Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me go through it step by step. The question is about identifying the product formed when Compound X reacts with red phosphorus and HI. The options are A, B, C, D. 

First, I'll look at the spectral data given for Compound X. The IR and NMR data can help me determine the structure of X, which is necessary to figure out what reaction it undergoes.

Starting with the IR data: The peaks are at 3400–2500 cm⁻¹, which usually indicates an O-H stretch. The 1720 cm⁻¹ peak suggests a carbonyl group, maybe a ketone or ester. The 1610 and 1450 cm⁻¹ are around the range for aromatic C=C stretching. So putting this together, Compound X might be an aromatic compound with a carbonyl group and some substituents.

Looking at the 1H NMR data:

- 10.5 ppm (bs, 1H): That's a broad singlet, which often corresponds to an acidic proton, like an -OH group. But wait, if there's a carbonyl, maybe it's an aldehyde proton? But aldehydes are usually around 9-10 ppm. Alternatively, it could be a phenolic -OH, but that would typically be broader and maybe exchange with D2O. However, the integration is 1H, so maybe it's an aldehyde.

Wait, but the 1720 cm⁻¹ in IR could be a ketone (around 1700-1750 cm⁻¹), but if it's an aldehyde, the carbonyl would be around 2820 and 2720 (stretching for C-H in aldehyde), but maybe I'm getting confused. Let's think again. The IR's 1720 is a strong peak, which is more typical for a carbonyl like a ketone or ester. Aldehyde's C=O is a bit lower in frequency, maybe around 1710-1740, but I'm not sure. Wait, aldehyde's O-H is around 2800-2700 cm⁻¹, which I don't see here. So maybe it's a ketone.

Wait, but the NMR has a peak at 10.5 ppm. Aldehyde protons are around 9-10 ppm. But if it's a ketone, the aldehyde peak wouldn't be present. Hmm. Wait, perhaps it's a carboxylic acid? Because carboxylic acids have an O-H stretch around 2500-3000 cm⁻¹ (which fits the 3400–2500 cm⁻¹ region), and the carbonyl around 1700. But the NMR shows a peak at 10.5, which for a carboxylic acid would be a broad peak due to exchange. So maybe it's a carboxylic acid.

Wait, but let me think about the NMR data again. The 10.5 ppm is a broad singlet, 1H. So it's a proton that's not split much. If it's a carboxylic acid, that's possible. But then the IR would have a broad O-H stretch around 2500-3000, which it does in the 3400–2500 region. But the 1720 cm⁻¹ would fit a carboxylic acid's carbonyl (they're usually around 1700). So maybe that's a possibility.

But wait, another option: maybe the 10.5 ppm is an aldehyde. But aldehydes have an IR peak around 2820 and 2720 cm⁻¹ for the C-H stretch. That's not present here, so maybe not an aldehyde. Alternatively, it could be an -OH group in a different environment, like an aromatic ring but that's less likely. Hmm.

Let me look at the other NMR signals. The 8.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.2 ppm (d, 2H) are indicative of a para-substituted benzene ring. The doublets suggest coupling between the aromatic protons. So, the structure likely has a benzene ring with substituents in the para positions. The integration is 2H each, so perhaps two substituents in para positions, each with two equivalent protons.

Then, the 2.9 ppm (m, 1H) is a multiplet, probably a methine (CH) group connected to something else, maybe an alkyl chain. The 1.7 ppm (m, 2H) could be two protons adjacent to the CH, perhaps part of a chain like CH2CH2. The 1.4 ppm (d, 3H) is a triplet, maybe a methyl group attached to a CH. The 0.9 ppm (t, 3H) is a terminal methyl group, like the end of an ethyl chain.

Putting this together, perhaps the structure is a benzene ring with substituents in para positions. One substituent could be a carbonyl group (from the IR), and the other could be an alkyl chain. Let's try to sketch this.

So, the benzene ring has a substituent at position 1 and 4 (para). One substituent is a -COOH group (if it's a carboxylic acid) or maybe a ketone or ester, but let's see. The other substituent might be an ethyl or butyl group.

Wait, but looking at the NMR's 10.5 ppm: if it's a carboxylic acid, that peak would be the -OH. So, the structure would be something like para-substituted benzoic acid, but with another substituent.

Wait, but let's look at the other substituent. The 2.9 ppm (m, 1H) suggests a CH group adjacent to something else. The 1.7 ppm (m, 2H) could be CH2 groups. Then, 1.4 ppm (d, 3H) is a CH3 attached to a CH. And 0.9 (t, 3H) is a CH2CH3, perhaps.

So, maybe the substituent is a chain like -CH(CH3)CH2CH3. Wait, that's a 3-methylpentyl group or something else? Let me count. Alternatively, the chain could be a butyl group.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a sec-butyl group. Let's see: the 0.9 ppm is a terminal CH2CH3 (ethyl group), then 1.4 ppm is a CH3 attached to a CH, which is connected to another CH2. So perhaps it's a -CH2-C(CH3)H-CH2-CH2- group? Or wait, maybe it's a -CH(CH2CH2CH3)CH2- group.

Wait, maybe it's a sec-butyl group. Let me think: the substituent is a group like -CH(CH2CH2CH3)-. But how does that connect? Alternatively, perhaps it's an isobutyl group. Let me think about the NMR shifts.

The 2.9 ppm (m, 1H) for a CH group suggests that it's adjacent to another CH2 group. The 1.7 ppm (m, 2H) could be two protons on a CH2 next to the CH. The 1.4 ppm (d, 3H) is a CH3 attached to the CH. So perhaps the substituent is -CH(CH3)CH2CH2CH3? No, that would make a longer chain. Alternatively, maybe it's a -CH(CH2CH2CH3) group, but that might not fit.

Wait, perhaps it's a cyclohexyl group, but that's probably not the case here. Alternatively, think about a butyl group. Let's see: the 0.9 ppm is the end of a ethyl group, perhaps as a -CH2CH3. Then, the 1.4 ppm is a methyl attached to a CH, which is connected to another CH2. So, maybe the group is -CH(CH3)CH2CH2- attached to the benzene ring. But wait, the integration for the CH is 1H, the CH2's are 2H each, and the methyl is 3H.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a propyl group, but I'm not sure. Wait, another approach: the 1.4 ppm is a triplet of a CH3, but it's a doublet here. That suggests it's attached to a CH group, which is split by neighboring protons.

Wait, perhaps the structure is a benzene ring with a substituent like -COOH and another substituent which is a -(CH2)2CH(CH3) group. But I'm not quite getting it.

Wait, another approach: let's consider the possible options given.

Looking at the options:

Option A: 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid. Structure would be a propanoic acid with a 4-ethylphenyl group attached at position 2. So, the acid is at C1, and the benzene is attached at C2.

Option B: 1-isobutyl-4-methylbenzene. That would be para-xylene with an isobutyl group. But where's the carbonyl then? Because the IR has a peak at 1720, which would be a carbonyl. So this option doesn't fit since it's benzene with only alkyl groups.

Option C: 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. Benzoic acid with a sec-butyl group at position 4. So the benzoic acid is at position 1, and the sec-butyl is at position 4. Let me think about the structure. Benzoic acid would have the COOH group. The sec-butyl group is -(CH2)CH(CH2CH3). Wait, no: a sec-butyl group is -CH2CH(CH2CH3)-? Or wait, the structure of sec-butyl is CH2CH2CH(CH3)- but maybe I'm getting the substituents wrong.

Option D: 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene. That's a para-xylene with a sec-butyl group. Again, no carbonyl, so the IR wouldn't show a 1720 peak. So options B and D don't have carbonyl groups, so probably not, given the IR data.

So from the options, either A or C have the carbonyl group. Looking back, the IR shows 1720 cm⁻¹, which is a strong carbonyl. So the compound must have a carbonyl. So options A and C are possible.

Now, let's analyze the NMR for option A: 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid.

Structure would be:

Ph-CH2-COOH.

Wait, wait. Wait, 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid. The propanoic acid is CH2CH2COOH, but the substituent is at position 2. So the structure would be:

Ph-CH2-COOH. Because position 2 of propanoic acid is the middle CH2.

Wait, no. Propanoic acid is CH2CH2COOH, but the substituent at position 2 would be on the middle carbon. So the structure would be: the benzene ring attached to the middle carbon of propanoic acid, making it CH2-C(Ph)-COOH.

Wait, that would be 2-phenylpropanoic acid. Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is in the benzene at position 4. So the benzene has an ethyl group at position 4, and is connected to the propanoic acid.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think about the NMR of option A.

The NMR would have a peak at around 10 ppm for the -COOH proton. The aromatic protons would be in two doublets, since it's para-substituted. The substituent on the benzene would be an ethyl group and the propanoic acid.

But wait, the NMR shows a 2.9 ppm (m, 1H), which is probably a methine (CH) group. In option A, the propanoic acid would have two CH2 groups and a COOH. So the protons on the CH2 next to COOH would be around 2.5 ppm or so. But the given NMR has a 2.9 ppm for a CH. Hmm, maybe that doesn't fit.

Alternatively, let's consider option C: 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid.

Structure: Benzoic acid with a sec-butyl group at position 4. So the benzoic acid is at position 1, and the substituent is at position 4.

So, the substituent is a sec-butyl group, which is a four-carbon chain attached to the ring with a branch. The sec-butyl group would be -(CH2)CH(CH2CH3). Wait, no, the correct structure for sec-butyl is CH2CH(CH2CH3). Wait, no: the structure of sec-butyl is CH2CH2CH(CH3)- but wait, but that would be a tertiary group. Hmm.

Wait, let me clarify. The sec-butyl group is -CH2CH(CH2CH3)-, but wait, no. Wait, butyl has four carbons. The structure of sec-butyl is CH2CH2CH(CH3). No, that's not correct. Let me think again. Butyl groups can be straight-chain (n-butyl), iso-butyl (where the branch is on the second carbon), or sec-butyl (but that's actually the same as iso-butyl in some contexts, but I might be mixing up terms). Wait, maybe it's better to draw it.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a -CH(CH2CH2CH3) group. But I'm getting a bit stuck. Let's think about the NMR data.

In option C, the substituent is a sec-butyl group. So the group would be -CH2CH(CH2CH3)-, but wait, that's the iso-butyl group. Alternatively, if it's a sec-butyl group, perhaps it's -CH2CH2CH(CH3)-, but wait, that's a tertiary butyl group. Hmm, maybe I'm mixing up the terms. Alternatively, perhaps it's a butyl group with a branch on the second carbon.

Wait, the correct structure of a sec-butyl group is -CH2CH(CH2CH3)-. No, that's not correct. Wait, butyl groups have four carbons. The iso-butyl group is CH2CH(CH3)2, but that's a branch on the second carbon, making it a tertiary group. The sec-butyl group would be a four-carbon group where the branch is on the third carbon, which doesn't make sense because butyl has four in a row. Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me think: n-butyl is CH2CH2CH2CH2-, iso-butyl is CH(CH2CH3)2, and sec-butyl would be CH2CH(CH2CH3)-, but that's actually the iso-butyl structure. Hmm, maybe the term 'sec-butyl' is incorrect, but perhaps the substituent is a butyl group with a branch.

Alternatively, perhaps I should just think about the NMR data matching the structure.

In the NMR, the 2.9 ppm (m, 1H) is a CH group. So if the substituent is a sec-butyl group, then the structure would be:

Ph-COOH and Ph-CH(CH2CH2CH3)- ?

Wait, perhaps the substituents are a COOH and a CH2CH(CH3)CH2 group. Hmm.

Wait, the substituent attached to the benzene in option C is a sec-butyl group. So, the structure would be benzene ring with a COOH group at position 1 and a sec-butyl group at position 4.

So the substituent is -CH2CH(CH2CH3)- attached to the ring.

Then, looking at the NMR:

The 10.5 ppm is the COOH proton.

The aromatic protons would be in two doublets: the substituents are in para positions, so the aromatic protons would be in two sets of two, each as doublets. That matches the NMR data.

Then, the substituent's protons:

The substituent is a sec-butyl group: the structure is -CH2-CH(CH2CH3)- attached to the ring.

Wait, no, wait: the substituent would be -(CH2)CH(CH3)CH2-?

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a -CH2CH(CH2CH3) group.

So the substituent has a CH2 connected to the ring, then a CH which is attached to another CH2CH3 and another CH2.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck, so perhaps it's better to look at the NMR shifts.

The NMR has a 2.9 ppm (m, 1H) which is the CH group. Then, the 1.7 ppm (m, 2H) are two CH2 groups. The 1.4 ppm (d, 3H) is a CH3 attached to the CH group. The 0.9 ppm (t, 3H) is a CH2CH3 group.

So, putting this substituent together:

The substituent attached to the ring is a CH2 group connected to a CH, which is connected to a CH2CH3 and another CH2 group.

Wait, that doesn't quite make sense. Let me think in terms of the substituent being a butyl group. So, perhaps it's a propyl group with a methyl branch.

Wait, the substituent chain might be:

-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3.

But that would make it a pentyl group or isobutyl.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a -CH(CH2CH2CH3)CH2- group. Hmm.

Wait, let's think about the substituent as a -(CH2)CH(CH3)CH2CH3 group. No, that's a longer chain.

Alternatively, maybe the substituent is a -(CH2)CH(CH2CH3) group, which would be a branch on the second carbon, making it an iso-butyl group. But the NMR doesn't quite fit that.

Wait, what about the substituent being a -CH(CH2CH2CH3) group attached to the ring via a CH2?

Wait, perhaps it's a -CH2-CH(CH2CH2CH3)- group. But that doesn't seem right either.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a -CH(CH3)CH2CH2- group. But that would require five carbons.

Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let's think about the NMR data for the substituent.

The substituent's NMR signals:

- 2.9 ppm (m, 1H): CH group.

- 1.7 ppm (m, 2H): two CH2 groups.

- 1.4 ppm (d, 3H): a CH3 attached to a CH.

- 0.9 ppm (t, 3H): a terminal CH2CH3.

So, the substituent must have a CH group connected to a CH3 (as a doublet), and that CH is connected to two CH2 groups, perhaps one leading to the ring and the other to a CH2CH3.

Wait, perhaps it's a -CH(CH3)CH2CH2- group. But that would be a four-carbon chain with a branch. Wait, but that would be a pentyl group.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is -CH(CH2CH2CH3)CH2- attached to the ring.

Wait, maybe the substituent is a -CH(CH2CH3)CH2CH2- group. I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach: the substituent has a structure that gives the following protons:

- The CH group (2.9 ppm, 1H)
- Two CH2 groups: perhaps a -CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-
- And a terminal CH2CH3.

Wait, maybe it's a -CH(CH3)-CH2-CH2-CH3 group, but that would be a pentyl group with a branch on the second carbon. Hmm.

Wait, let me think about the substituent as a -CH(CH2CH2CH3) group. Then the structure would be:

Ring-CH2-CH(CH2CH2CH3)

But that doesn't seem right.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a -CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2- group. Then, looking at the NMR, the CH group is at 2.9 ppm, the CH2 groups are at 1.7 and 0.9. But I'm getting a bit stuck here.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a -CH(CH2CH3)CH2- group. So the structure is:

Ring-CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-

Wait, but then the 1.4 ppm would be a CH3 attached to the CH, and the 0.9 ppm is the CH2CH3 group.

So, the substituent would be:

Ring-CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-CH2- ?

Wait, but that doesn't seem to fit. Alternatively, perhaps it's a -CH(CH2CH2CH3) group, but that's a longer chain.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a -CH(CH3)CH2CH2- group, but I'm not certain.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the substituent is a -CH(CH3)CH2CH2- group, which would give:

- The CH group attached to the ring (2.9 ppm, 1H)
- The adjacent CH2 group (1.7 ppm, 2H)
- The next CH2 group (1.4 ppm, but that's a doublet, which doesn't quite match)
- And the terminal CH2CH3 (0.9 ppm).

Hmm, not sure.

Another approach: the substituent is a -CH(CH3)-CH2CH2- group. So the structure is:

Ring-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH2-CH3?

Wait, that would be a pentyl group with a branch on the second carbon. But that would give the following NMR signals:

- The CH (branch) at 2.9 ppm (1H)
- The adjacent CH2 (from the ring) at 1.7 ppm (2H)
- The CH2 connected to CH3 at 1.4 ppm (2H, but in the data it's 3H as a doublet, so that doesn't fit)
- The terminal CH3 at 0.9 ppm (3H, triplet).

Wait, maybe the substituent is a -CH(CH3)-CH2- group, making it a butyl group. Then, the structure would be:

Ring-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH2-CH3.

Wait, that's a pentyl group, which might not fit the NMR data.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a -CH(CH3)-CH2-CH2- group, but that's getting too long.

Wait, let me think about the substituent as a -CH2-CH(CH3)- group. Then, the substituent is attached to the ring via a CH2 group, followed by a CH(CH3), and then a CH2CH2CH3.

Wait, that would give:

- The CH2 attached to the ring (perhaps at 1.7 ppm, 2H)
- The CH(CH3) at 2.9 ppm (1H)
- The next CH2 (maybe around 1.7 ppm, but not sure)
- And the terminal CH2CH3 at 0.9 ppm.

Hmm, but the NMR data doesn't support that.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a -CH(CH3)-CH2-CH2- group, making it a butyl group with a branch on the second carbon. So the structure would be:

Ring-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH2-CH3.

But that's a pentyl group, which might not fit.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a -CH(CH2CH2CH3) group. Then, the structure would be:

Ring-CH2-CH(CH2CH2CH3).

But that doesn't seem right either.

I'm getting stuck here, so perhaps I should look at the options again.

Option C is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid.

So the structure is:

Benzoic acid (COOH at position 1) and a sec-butyl group at position 4.

The sec-butyl group is -(CH2)CH(CH2CH3)-.

Wait, but that's not correct because the sec-butyl group is a four-carbon substituent where the branch is on the third carbon, which isn't possible for a four-carbon chain. Wait, maybe I'm getting the terminology wrong. Let me clarify.

Butyl groups: n-butyl is CH2CH2CH2CH2-, iso-butyl is CH(CH2CH3)2, and sec-butyl is CH2CH(CH2CH3)-. Hmm, but that would give a four-carbon substituent with a branch on the second carbon.

So, the substituent would be:

Ph-COOH and Ph-CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-.

So, the substituent is a -CH2CH(CH2CH3) group attached to the benzene ring.

In that case, the substituent's protons would be:

- The CH2 attached to the ring: two protons, perhaps around 1.7 ppm (m, 2H)
- The CH group attached to the CH2 and CH2CH3: 1H at 2.9 ppm (m, 1H)
- The CH2CH3 group: 3H at 0.9 ppm (t, 3H)
- The CH3 attached to the CH group: 3H at 1.4 ppm (d, 3H)

Wait, that doesn't fit because the CH3 attached to the CH would be a triplet, but in the NMR, it's a doublet at 1.4 ppm.

Hmm, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Let me think about the structure again.

If the substituent is -CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-, then the CH group is attached to the CH2 (ring) and to a CH2CH3. So, the CH has two neighboring groups: the CH2 (ring) and the CH2CH3. So the CH's protons would be split into a triplet or a quartet, but in the NMR it's a multiplet at 2.9 ppm.

The CH2 attached to the ring would be next to the CH group, so their protons would be split by the CH group. That could explain the 1.7 ppm (m, 2H) as the CH2 attached to the ring.

The CH2CH3 group would give a triplet at 0.9 ppm (3H), which matches the data.

The CH3 attached to the CH group would be a triplet as well, but in the data, it's a doublet at 1.4 ppm. Hmm, that doesn't fit. So maybe I'm not interpreting this correctly.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a -CH(CH2CH2CH3) group. Then, the substituent would be:

Ph-COOH and Ph-CH(CH2CH2CH3)-.

In that case, the CH would be connected to the ring and to a CH2CH2CH3 group. The CH's protons would be split by the neighboring groups.

But I'm not sure if that would produce the NMR signals we have.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a -CH(CH3)CH2- group attached to the ring. Then, the structure would be:

Ph-COOH and Ph-CH(CH3)CH2-.

But that would leave the other end of the chain as a CH2 group, which might not fit.

Another approach: perhaps the substituent is a -CH(CH2CH3)CH2- group.

Wait, but then the substituent would be:

Ph-CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-CH2-.

Which is a longer chain, perhaps a pentyl group, but that doesn't fit the NMR data.

I'm getting a bit stuck, so maybe I should try to match the NMR data to the options.

Option C: 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid.

The structure would be:

COOH at position 1, and at position 4, a sec-butyl group: -(CH2)CH(CH2CH3)-.

So, the substituent is -CH2CH(CH2CH3)- attached to the ring.

Now, the substituent's CH2 (attached to the ring) would have two protons, perhaps around 1.7 ppm (m, 2H).

The CH group (from CH(CH2CH3)) would have one proton (2.9 ppm, m, 1H).

The CH2CH3 group (from CH(CH2CH3)) would have three protons at 0.9 ppm (t, 3H).

The CH3 attached to the CH would be a triplet, but in the NMR, it's a doublet at 1.4 ppm (d, 3H). Hmm, that doesn't seem to fit. So perhaps this structure isn't right.

Wait, but maybe the CH3 is attached to the CH in a way that it's a secondary structure, making it a doublet. Alternatively, maybe the CH3 is on a CH that's adjacent to another CH2 group, leading to a doublet.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a -CH(CH3)CH2- group, so the structure is:

Ph-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH2-CH3.

But that's a longer chain, possibly a pentyl group. But the NMR doesn't seem to match.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a -CH(CH2CH3) group, attached via a CH2 to the ring. So, the substituent would be:

Ph-CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-.

In this case, the substituent's protons would be:

- CH2 connected to the ring: two protons at around 1.7 ppm (m, 2H)
- CH group: one proton at 2.9 ppm (m, 1H)
- CH2CH3 group: three protons at 0.9 ppm (t, 3H)
- The CH3 in CH(CH2CH3): three protons attached to the CH, which would be split by the adjacent CH2 groups. Wait, but in the NMR, there's a 1.4 ppm (d, 3H), which is a doublet. That suggests that the CH3 is attached to a CH, which is connected to another CH2, perhaps? Or maybe it's a CH3 attached to a CH that's only adjacent to one other CH2 group.

Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think about the options again.

The correct option must have a substituent that matches the NMR data and the IR data.

Looking back at the IR, the peak at 1720 cm⁻¹ could be a carboxylic acid, as their carbonyls are around 1700-1725 cm⁻¹. So option C is a benzoic acid with a substituent.

In the NMR, the substituent would have a CH group at 2.9 ppm, and the other groups as mentioned.

Now, the reaction part: Compound X reacts with red phosphorus and HI. Red phosphorus and HI are typically used in the Wolff-Kishner reaction, which reduces carbonyl groups (like ketones, aldehydes) to methylene groups. But wait, in the presence of amines or other groups, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, in some cases, it can be used for the elimination of carbonyl groups, perhaps forming alkanes.

Wait, another reaction: when a carboxylic acid is treated with red phosphorus and HI, it can undergo the Clemmensen reduction, but I'm not sure. Wait, no, the Clemmensen is for ketones to form alkanes, using Zn(Hg)/HCl. The Wolff-Kishner uses hydrazine followed by strong base and heat, which isn't the case here.

Wait, but red phosphorus and HI can also be used in the reduction of esters or amides, but perhaps more importantly, in the presence of a carbonyl group, it can lead to its removal. Alternatively, maybe it's a reaction to form an alkane.

Wait, considering the reaction: X (with a carbonyl) reacts with red phosphorus and HI. So, perhaps the carbonyl group is reduced.

Wait, another possibility is that the carbonyl is converted into a methyl group. For example, in the case of a ketone, the Wolff-Kishner would reduce it to a methylene group. But if X is a carboxylic acid, would that reaction proceed?

Alternatively, perhaps the carboxylic acid is converted into an acid chloride, but that would require a different reaction condition, like SOCl2.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a decarboxylation. But I'm not sure if red phosphorus and HI cause that.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a substitution. If X has a leaving group, but the data doesn't suggest that.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is the elimination of the carbonyl group. For example, if X is a benzoyl chloride, reacting with HI would substitute the Cl with I, but that's not the case here.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is the reduction of the carbonyl group. But I'm not sure which reagent does that.

Wait, another thought: red phosphorus and HI can be used to reduce alkenes to alkanes via the hydroboration-oxidation, but that's not applicable here.

Alternatively, when a nitrile is treated with HI and red phosphorus, it can be reduced to an amine. But X doesn't seem to have a nitrile.

Wait, perhaps in this case, the reaction is a substitution where the oxygen of the carbonyl is replaced by an iodide. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is the conversion of a carbonyl group into a CH2 group. So, for example, if X has a ketone, it would become CH2.

But wait, the initial compound X is a carboxylic acid (from the IR and NMR data), which has a carbonyl group. So, if X is a benzoic acid derivative, and it reacts with red phosphorus and HI, perhaps it undergoes some kind of substitution or reduction.

Wait, another possibility: the reaction is the removal of the acid group, but that doesn't seem right.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is the formation of an alkyl iodide. For example, if X has an acidic hydrogen alpha to the carbonyl group, it could form an enol, which could then undergo substitution.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Let me think about the options again.

If X is benzoic acid with a substituent, and the reaction reduces the carbonyl group, what would happen? Let's say X is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid (option C), and it undergoes a reaction that removes the carbonyl group.

If the carbonyl is removed, the COOH would become a CH2 group. So the product would be 4-(sec-butyl)benzyl group, but with what?

Wait, if the reaction is the reduction of the carbonyl group, then the COOH would become CH2OH (if it's a ketone, it would become CH2). But wait, benzoic acid has a COOH group, so reducing it would form CH2OH, which is a benzyl alcohol. But that's not one of the options.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is more drastic, like cleaving the carbonyl group. Wait, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the reaction is a substitution where the COOH group is replaced by something else.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is the formation of an acyl iodide. But with red phosphorus and HI, maybe.

Wait, another approach: maybe the reaction is the formation of an alkyl iodide. For example, if X has an -OH group, it could be replaced by I. But X is a carboxylic acid, so the -OH is on the COOH group.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction involves the displacement of the -OH in the substituent. For example, if the substituent has a leaving group, but I don't think so.

Hmm, I'm getting a bit stuck on this reaction part. Let me think again about what the reaction does. Red phosphorus and HI are often used in the presence of a carbonyl group to reduce it to a methylene group. So, for example, in the Wolff-Kishner reaction, the carbonyl is replaced by a methylene group. But wait, that reaction uses hydrazine and then strong base, not red phosphorus and HI.

Wait, but in the presence of red phosphorus and HI, perhaps the same effect happens. So, if X is a ketone, it would be reduced to an alkane. But if X is a carboxylic acid, perhaps the carbonyl is removed, and the COOH is replaced by CH2.

So, if X is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid (option C), then after the reaction, the COOH group would become CH2, making the product 4-(sec-butyl)benzyl group, but that doesn't seem right.

Wait, no, the product would be 4-(sec-butyl)benzyl iodide or something else. Alternatively, perhaps the COOH is replaced by a methyl group.

Wait, another thought: if the reaction removes the oxygen from the carbonyl group, turning it into a methylene group, then the product would be a benzene ring with a CH2 group and the substituent.

So, if X is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid (option C), the product would be 4-(sec-butyl)benzene with a CH2 group attached to the ring where the COOH was. But I'm not sure about that.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a substitution where the COOH is replaced by an iodide. But I don't think red phosphorus and HI do that.

Alternatively, perhaps the carbonyl group is simply removed, and the structure becomes a benzene ring with a CH2 group where the COOH was, and the substituent.

Wait, let me think about the options again to see which product makes sense.

The options are:

A) 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid

B) 1-isobutyl-4-methylbenzene

C) 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid

D) 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene

The reaction is with red phosphorus and HI. I'm starting to think that the reaction is a reduction of the carbonyl group, converting it into a methylene group.

So, if X is benzoic acid (option C), the product after reaction would be 4-(sec-butyl)benzene with a CH2 group where the COOH was. Wait, but how would that structure look?

Alternatively, perhaps the product would be 4-(sec-butyl)benzyl iodide, but none of the options match that.

Wait, maybe the reaction is a substitution where the -COOH group is replaced by an iodide. That would require activating the carbonyl as a leaving group, perhaps by converting it into an acyl iodide. Red phosphorus and HI might do that. So, if X is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid, reacting with HI and red phosphorus could replace the -OH in the COOH with iodide, making it -COI. But that's an acid chloride-like structure. However, I'm not sure if that's a common reaction.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is the formation of an acid iodide, which would then undergo further reactions. But I'm not sure how that would fit the options.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a Friedel-Crafts alkylation, but that requires an alkyl halide and a Lewis acid catalyst, which might not be the case here.

Hmm, I'm getting stuck. Let's try to think differently. The reaction of a carboxylic acid with red phosphorus and HI could be the formation of an acyl iodide. Benzoic acid would react with excess HI in the presence of red phosphorus to form benzoyl iodide. But that's a different structure, which isn't among the options.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is the elimination of CO2, forming an alkane. But I'm not sure.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the reaction is the conversion of the carboxylic acid into an aldehyde. But that doesn't seem to fit with the reagents.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is the reduction of the carboxylic acid to a primary alcohol. But with red phosphorus and HI, I'm not sure if that's possible.

Wait, maybe I should look up what red phosphorus and HI do in such reactions. Well, considering that red phosphorus is a reducing agent, and HI is a source of I- and H+. In some cases, red phosphorus can help in the substitution reactions, especially in activating certain groups.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is the formation of an iodide from an alcohol. But X is a carboxylic acid, not an alcohol.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is the substitution of the -OH in the carboxylic acid with iodide, making an acid iodide. So, X (carboxylic acid) reacts with HI and red phosphorus to form the corresponding acid iodide. But the product options don't include an acid iodide; they're all alkanes or substituted benzenes.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is the elimination of the COOH group. For example, removing the oxygen and replacing it with a CH2 group, but that would require a reducing agent.

Wait, maybe the reaction is a decarboxylation, where the COOH group is removed, forming an alkane. But I'm not sure about the conditions for that.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is the conversion of the carboxylic acid into a benzyl alcohol. But again, I'm not sure about the reagents.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is not a reduction but an elimination. For example, if X has a substituent that can undergo elimination, maybe forming an alkene. But the initial data doesn't suggest that.

I'm really stuck here. Let me try to think about the possible product structures.

Looking at the options, options B and D are just substituted benzenes without any functional groups. Options A and C have functional groups (propanoic acid and benzoic acid, respectively).

If X is a carboxylic acid (option C), and the reaction removes the carbonyl group, then the product would be a substituted benzene without the acid group. So the product would be a substituted benzene, perhaps option B or D.

Looking at option B: 1-isobutyl-4-methylbenzene. That's para-xylene with an isobutyl group. But where's the methyl group?

Option D: 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene. That's a para-substituted benzene with a sec-butyl group at position 1 and a methyl at position 4.

Wait, but the initial compound X is a benzoic acid, so after the reaction, the COOH would be transformed into something else. If the reaction reduces the COOH to a CH2 group, then the product would be a benzene ring with a CH2 group and the substituent.

But the options don't have that. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction forms a benzene ring with a substituent from the original substituent and a new substituent from the reaction.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction cleaves the COOH group entirely, but that seems unlikely.

Wait, another angle: the reaction could be the formation of an alkyl iodide. For example, if X has a hydroxyl group, it could be replaced by iodide. But in this case, X is a carboxylic acid, so the -OH is on the COOH group. Maybe the reaction converts the COOH into a iodide, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is the formation of a benzyl iodide. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is the substitution of the -OH in the COOH group with iodide, making -COI. But that's not an option here.

Another possibility: the reaction is a rearrangement. But I don't see how that applies.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is the formation of a Grignard reagent, but that would require Mg, which isn't present here.

Hmm, perhaps I should think about the reaction as a substitution where the -COOH group is replaced by -CH2I. But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is the reduction of the COOH group to a CH2 group. So, the product would have a CH2 where the COOH was, and the substituent remains.

But looking at the options, option D is 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene. That has two substituents: a sec-butyl at position 1 and a methyl at position 4. But in X, the substituents are a COOH at 1 and a substituent at 4.

Wait, perhaps the reaction replaces the COOH at position 1 with a methyl group. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction removes the COOH group, leaving behind a methyl group.

Wait, maybe the reaction is the cleavage of the carbonyl group, turning COOH into CH2. So, the product would be a benzene ring with a CH2 group where the COOH was and the substituent remains as a sec-butyl group.

But that's not one of the options. The options B and D don't have any functional groups.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a substitution where the COOH group is replaced by an iodine atom, making the structure 4-iodo-sec-butyl benzene. But that's not an option either.

I'm really not making progress here. Let me think about the reaction again.

Red phosphorus and HI are typically used in the presence of carbonyl groups, such as in ketones or aldehydes, to reduce them to alkanes. For example, a ketone (R-CO-R') would be reduced to R-CH2-R'. In the case of a carboxylic acid (R-COOH), perhaps the reaction would reduce the COOH to a CH2 group, leading to R-CH2.

So, if X is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid (option C), the reaction would reduce the COOH group to a CH2 group, resulting in 4-(sec-butyl)benzene with a CH2 group attached where the COOH was.

But looking at the options, option D is 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene. That doesn't match. Alternatively, option B is 1-isobutyl-4-methylbenzene. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the reaction doesn't just reduce the COOH group but also affects the substituent. Alternatively, maybe the substituent is transformed into something else.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction replaces the COOH group with an iodide, but I don't see an option that matches that.

I'm really stuck, so I'll have to make an educated guess. Based on the spectral data, the correct structure for X is option C: 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. Then, the reaction with red phosphorus and HI would reduce the carbonyl group to a CH2 group, resulting in a benzene ring with a CH2 group and the sec-butyl substituent.

But looking at the options, the only product that fits a benzene ring with substituents is option D: 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene. Wait, but where does the methyl come from? Maybe during the reaction, a methyl group is formed.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the structure of X. Let me reevaluate.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is not a sec-butyl group but a different substituent. Let me think again about the NMR.

The substituent's NMR: 2.9 ppm (m, 1H), 1.7 ppm (m, 2H), 1.4 ppm (d, 3H), 0.9 ppm (t, 3H).

This suggests a chain of CH-CH2-CH2-CH3. So, the substituent is a butyl group. But where is the branching?

Looking at option D: 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene. The substituents are a sec-butyl at position 1 and a methyl at position 4. Wait, but the NMR of X doesn't show a methyl at position 4; the aromatic protons are in two doublets, suggesting substituents in positions 1 and 4, each with two protons.

Wait, but in option D, the substituents are a sec-butyl and a methyl. So, the aromatic protons would be in two doublets: the substituents are in para positions. So, in that case, the NMR would have two doublets for the aromatic protons. Which matches the data.

The substituent in option D is a sec-butyl at position 1 and a methyl at position 4. So, the substituent's protons would be:

For the sec-butyl group:

- The CH group at 2.9 ppm (1H)
- The adjacent CH2 groups at 1.7 ppm (2H)
- The CH3 groups at 1.4 ppm (3H, d) and 0.9 ppm (3H, t)

But in the NMR data, the substituent's protons are:

2.9 (m,1H), 1.7 (m,2H), 1.4 (d,3H), 0.9 (t,3H)

Which matches the substituent in option D: the substituent is a sec-butyl group attached to the benzene ring.

Wait, but then X would be 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene, which is option D. But wait, the initial analysis of the IR data showed a carbonyl group. Option D doesn't have a carbonyl; it's just a substituted benzene. So that would contradict the IR data.

Hmm, this is confusing. So earlier I thought the IR data indicated a carbonyl group, pointing to option C. But the reaction conditions now make me doubt that.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in interpreting the IR data. Let me reevaluate the IR peaks.

The IR peaks are at 3400–2500 cm⁻¹ (broad, likely O-H), 1720 cm⁻¹ (carbonyl), 1610 and 1450 cm⁻¹ (aromatic C=C).

So, the presence of a carbonyl group (1720 cm⁻¹) suggests that X is a compound with a carbonyl, which rules out options B and D, which are simple substituted benzenes without functional groups.

So, options A and C are the only possibilities.

Thus, X is either option A or C.

Now, considering the reaction: X (with a carbonyl) reacts with red phosphorus and HI. I think this is a reduction reaction where the carbonyl group is converted into a CH2 group.

So, if X is option A: 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid.

The structure would be:

Ph-CH2-COOH.

After reaction, the COOH would be reduced to CH2, making the structure Ph-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3. Wait, that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction removes the COOH and forms a CH2 group.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction reduces the propanoic acid's carbonyl to a CH2 group, making a propane chain.

But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, if X is option C: 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid.

After reaction, the COOH is replaced by CH2, making the structure 4-(sec-butyl)benzyl group. But again, the options don't include that.

Hmm, perhaps the reaction leads to the formation of an alkane. So, the product would be a substituted benzene without any functional groups, which would be option B or D.

But wait, earlier I thought the IR data indicates a carbonyl, so options B and D are out.

This is getting too confusing. I think I'll have to go with option C as X, and after the reaction, the product would be 4-(sec-butyl)benzene with a CH2 group where the COOH was. But that's not one of the options. Alternatively, perhaps the product is 4-(sec-butyl)benzene, which isn't an option either.

Wait, perhaps the reaction isn't a reduction but something else. Maybe the carbonyl is converted into an iodide, but that doesn't fit the options.

Given the time I've spent, I'll have to make a decision.

Based on the NMR data, X has a para-substituted benzene with substituents that include a carbonyl group (so either A or C). The reaction with red phosphorus and HI likely reduces the carbonyl group to a CH2 group. So, if X is option C (4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid), the product would be 4-(sec-butyl)benzene with a CH2 group where the COOH was. But this structure isn't an option.

Looking at the options again, perhaps the product is option D: 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene. But that would mean that the COOH group was replaced by a methyl group, which I'm not sure about.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in identifying X as option C. Maybe X is option A: 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid.

In that case, the structure is Ph-CH2-COOH. The reaction would reduce the COOH to CH2, making Ph-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3. But that's not one of the options.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is cleavage of the carbonyl group, making Ph-CH2-CH2-CH3.

But again, not matching the options.

Another approach: perhaps the reaction is the formation of an iodide, and the product is an alkyl iodide. But the options don't include that.

Hmm. I'm going to have to go with option C as X, and after the reaction, the product is 4-(sec-butyl)benzene, which isn't an option. So perhaps I made a mistake earlier.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is not reducing the carbonyl but doing something else. For example, if X is a methyl benzoate (an ester), the reaction would reduce it to a CH2 group. But X is a carboxylic acid.

I'm really stuck. I'll have to make a guess. Given the reaction conditions, I think the product is option D: 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene. But I'm not confident.


The problem involves identifying the final product when Compound X reacts with red phosphorus and HI. The analysis begins with interpreting the spectral data for Compound X:

### IR Data:
- **3400–2500 cm⁻¹**: Indicates an O-H stretch, likely from a carboxylic acid.
- **1720 cm⁻¹**: Suggests a carbonyl group, likely from a carboxylic acid.
- **1610 cm⁻¹ and 1450 cm⁻¹**: Aromatic C=C stretching, indicating a benzene ring.

### ¹H NMR Data:
- **10.5 ppm (bs, 1H)**: A broad singlet, likely the -OH proton of a carboxylic acid.
- **8.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.2 ppm (d, 2H)**: Two doublets, consistent with a para-substituted benzene ring.
- **2.9 ppm (m, 1H)**: A methine (CH) group.
- **1.7 ppm (m, 2H)**: Two protons on a CH₂ group.
- **1.4 ppm (d, 3H)**: A methyl group (CH₃) attached to a CH.
- **0.9 ppm (t, 3H)**: A terminal methyl group (CH₃) at the end of an ethyl chain.

### Structural Analysis of Compound X:
The NMR data suggests a para-substituted benzene ring with a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) and a substituent containing a CH-CH₂-CH₂-CH₃ chain. This matches **Option C: 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid**, where the benzene ring has a carboxylic acid group at position 1 and a sec-butyl group at position 4.

### Reaction with Red Phosphorus and HI:
Red phosphorus and HI are reducing agents. In this case, the reaction likely reduces the carbonyl group of the carboxylic acid to a methylene group (-CH₂-). This transforms the carboxylic acid group (-COOH) into a methyl group (-CH₃), resulting in a para-substituted benzene ring with a methyl group at position 1 and a sec-butyl group at position 4.

### Final Product:
The product is **1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene**, which corresponds to **Option D**.

ANSWER: D
