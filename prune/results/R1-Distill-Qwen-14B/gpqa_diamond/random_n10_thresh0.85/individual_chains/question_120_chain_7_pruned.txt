Okay, I'm trying to solve this multiple-choice question about stars and their distribution in terms of parallax. Hmm, let me think. So the question is about how the number of stars per unit range of parallax (plx) changes with plx. The options are different power laws, like 1/plx^4, etc.

Wait, I remember that parallax is related to distance. Parallax (in arcseconds) is inversely proportional to distance (in parsecs). So if a star has a parallax plx, its distance d is 1/plx parsecs. Right.

Now, the problem says stars are uniformly distributed. That probably means that the number density of stars is uniform in space. So, the number of stars in a certain volume depends on the volume. Because the distribution is uniform, the number per unit volume is the same everywhere.

But wait, the question is about the number per unit range of parallax. So how does the number of stars in a range of parallax (say from plx to plx + dplx) depend on plx?

Let me think about the relationship between distance and parallax. Since d = 1/plx, as plx increases, the distance decreases. So higher parallax means closer stars.

Now, the range of parallax dplx corresponds to a range in distance. Let's see: if plx increases by dplx, what's the corresponding change in distance? Let me compute dplx in terms of d.

Since plx = 1/d, then d = 1/plx. So differentiating both sides, dd = - (1/plx²) dplx. Wait, but I'm interested in the differential in terms of d. Let me think, plx =1/d → d = 1/plx → plx =1/(d). So when plx increases by dplx, the distance d decreases by how much?

Hmm, maybe I should express the volume in terms of distance. The number of stars in a thin spherical shell at distance d with thickness dd would be the volume of the shell times the number density (which is uniform). The volume of a thin shell is 4π d² dd. So the number of stars would be proportional to 4π d² dd.

But how does this relate to parallax? Since d = 1/plx, I can express everything in terms of plx.

So the number of stars in a shell at distance d is N = n * 4π d² dd, where n is the number density.

But since d =
