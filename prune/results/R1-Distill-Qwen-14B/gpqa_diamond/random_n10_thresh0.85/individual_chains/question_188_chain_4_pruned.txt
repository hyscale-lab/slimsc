Okay, so I've got this question about crystallography, specifically about a rhombohedral crystal. Hmm, I remember that in crystals, the interplanar distance is the distance between adjacent planes in the crystal lattice. The question gives the interatomic distance as 10 Angstroms, but wait, interatomic distance usually refers to the distance between two adjacent atoms, like along a lattice parameter. Oh, right, in a rhombohedral crystal, all the edges are equal and the angles are the same. Here, the angles alpha, beta, gamma are all 30 degrees. 

The plane in question is the (111) plane. So I need to find the interplanar distance d for this plane. From what I recall, there's a formula that relates the lattice parameter (a) to the interplanar distance. Oh yes, the formula is d = a / sqrt(h² + k² + l² + 2hk cos α + 2hl cos β + 2kl cos γ)^(1/2) ), but wait, I think I might be mixing it up. Alternatively, I remember another formula for a rhombohedral system. 

Wait, another approach: since it's a rhombohedral structure, the unit cell is a cube that's been skewed, right? But wait, no, rhombohedral is when all edges are equal and angles are equal but not necessarily 90 degrees. So the unit cell is a rhombohedron. 

The formula for interplanar distance in a unit cell is given by d_{hkl} = (a^2 (1 + 2 cos α )) / ( (h^2 + k^2 + l^2) + 2(hk + hl + kl) cos α ) )^(1/2) ) * something? Wait, no, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me think again. 

Alternatively, I recall the general formula for interplanar distance in a crystal is d = a / (sqrt( (h/l)^2 + (k/m)^2 + (n/p)^2 )) ), but that's for orthorhombic systems, I think. No, wait, for cubic systems, it's just d = a / sqrt(h² + k² + l²). But rhombohedral is a bit different.
