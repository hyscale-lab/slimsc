Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me try to break it down.

The setup is an uncharged spherical conductor with a small cavity inside. The conductor has radius R, and the cavity has radius r, which is smaller than R. The center of the cavity is at a distance s from the center of the conductor. So, imagine a big sphere, and inside it, somewhere not at the center, there's a smaller empty space. Now, someone puts a small positive charge +q inside this cavity. 

The question is about finding the electric field E at a point P outside the conductor. Point P is a distance L from the center of the spherical conductor, and its distance from the cavity's center is l. Also, l and L are both greater than R, so P is definitely outside. The angle between l and s (the distance between the two centers) is theta.

Hmm, I remember from my studies that conductors have some interesting properties when it comes to electric fields and charges. Since the conductor is uncharged, I think the charges inside the cavity will induce charges on the inner and outer surfaces of the conductor.

Wait, right! When a charge is placed inside a cavity of a conductor, it induces an equal and opposite charge on the inner surface of the conductor. But wait, the conductor itself is neutral, so the inner surface must have an induced charge of -q. Then, since the conductor as a whole is neutral, the outer surface must have a charge of +q. Because the inner induced charge is -q, and the outer has to balance that to keep the conductor neutral. So the outer surface charge is +q.

But wait, the conductor is a sphere initially, but the cavity isn't at the center. The cavity is off-center, so the induced charges won't be uniformly distributed. But for points outside the conductor, does the distribution matter? I think so because the external field depends on the distribution of the charges on the outer surface.

Wait, no, wait. When you have a charge inside a cavity of a conductor, the inner surface of the conductor has an induced charge, and the outer surface has the same as the net charge on the conductor plus the inner induced charge. Wait, no, the conductor is neutral, so the inner surface has -q, and the outer has +q. But wait, no, the conductor's initial charge is zero. So the inner surface must have -q, and the outer has +q to balance, making the total charge of the conductor zero.

So, the conductor's outer surface has a charge of +q. Now, when we're looking for the electric field outside the conductor at point P, that's where the outer charge distribution matters. Now, for a spherical conductor, the charges on the outer surface would arrange themselves to make the electric field outside as if all the charge were concentrated at the center. But wait, that's only the case if the conductor is a perfect sphere and the charge distribution is symmetric. But in this problem, the cavity is not at the center, so the outer charge might not be spherically symmetric.

Wait, but wait a second. The point P is outside the conductor, so the distance from P to the conductor's center is L. The conductor is a sphere of radius R, but the point P is outside, so L > R. The cavity's center is at a distance s from the conductor's center, and the point P is at a distance l from the cavity's center, with an angle theta between l and s.

Wait, perhaps I should model this. The conductor's outer surface is at radius R. The charge on the outer surface is +q, but it's not uniformly distributed because the cavity is off-center. But when calculating the electric field outside the conductor, the outer charge acts as if it were a point charge at the center of the conductor. Because the outer surface, regardless of distribution, for points outside, behaves as a point charge at the center due to the shell theorem. So even if the charge distribution isn't uniform, for points outside, the field would be the same as if all the charge were at the center.

Wait, but wait, the charge on the outer surface is +q, but the conductor is a sphere. So even if the cavity is off-center, the outer surface's charge distribution might not be spherically symmetric. Hmm, but I'm a bit confused here. Let me think again.

Wait, the inner surface of the conductor has a charge of -q, and the outer surface has +q. The inner charge is induced by the +q in the cavity, so it's a shell of charge -q at the inner radius. Then, the conductor's material is a conductor, so the charges can move freely. The inner charge -q will arrange itself on the inner surface, but because the cavity is not at the center of the conductor, the inner surface's charge distribution isn't uniform. But the outer surface's charge, which is +q, is on a sphere of radius R. Wait, but the outer surface is a sphere, so regardless of where the inner charge is, the outer surface's charge can distribute itself in a way that for any external point, the field is as if the charge were at the center.

Wait, but no, because the conductor is a sphere, any excess charge on the outer surface will distribute uniformly only if there are no other charges inside. Wait, in this case, the outer surface's charge is +q, but the inner surface has -q. So the outer surface being a conductor's surface, regardless of the inner charges, will have a uniform distribution. Wait, no, because the conductor's outer surface is a sphere, so the charges would arrange themselves uniformly on the outer surface. Because the conductor is a sphere, the outer surface would have a uniform charge distribution, irrespective of the inner cavity's position.

Wait, but the inner cavity is off-center, so the charge distribution on the inner surface isn't uniform. But the outer surface is a sphere, so the charge +q would be uniformly distributed. Because in a conductor, the charges on the outer surface arrange themselves to make the electric field inside the conductor zero. So, for a spherical conductor, regardless of inner charges, the outer surface's charge would distribute uniformly. Thus, the electric field outside the conductor would be that of a point charge +q at the center of the conductor.

Wait, but let me think again. Suppose the cavity is not at the center. Then, the inner surface's charge is -q, but since the cavity is not at the center, the inner surface's charge distribution is not symmetric. But the outer surface's charge is +q, and since it's a sphere, the outer surface's charge distribution would still be uniform. Because the conductor's outer surface is a shell, and any excess charge on a conducting shell distributes uniformly regardless of any charges inside the cavity as long as the shell is a conductor.

So, the electric field outside the conductor (at any point outside) would be the same as the field due to a point charge +q located at the center of the conductor.

So, the point P is at a distance L from the center of the conductor. Therefore, the electric field at P would be E = (1/(4πε₀)) * (q / L²) in magnitude, directed radially outward since the charge is positive.

Looking at the options, option B says E = (1/(4πε₀)) * (q / L²). That's exactly what I concluded.

Wait, but let me make sure I'm not missing anything. Let me think about the point P's position relative to the cavity. The distance from P to the cavity's center is l, and the angle between l and s (the distance between the centers) is theta. So, s is the displacement between the centers of the conductor and the cavity.

Wait, but the field at P is due to the charge +q on the outer surface of the conductor, which is at the conductor's center. So the distance from point P to the conductor's center is L. Therefore, the field is (1/(4πε₀)) q/(L²), regardless of where the cavity is located or how the point P is situated. So option B is correct.

Hmm, but I should also think about whether the presence of the inner cavity's position affects the external field. But no, because the external field only depends on the net charge outside, which is +q at the conductor's center. The inner cavity's position doesn't influence the external field because the conductor's outer surface's charge distribution is uniform, so it acts as a point charge at the center.

So the correct answer should be option B.


The problem involves an uncharged spherical conductor of radius $R$ with a small spherical cavity of radius $r$ inside it. The center of the cavity is separated from the center of the conductor by a distance $s$, and the cavity contains a small positive charge $+q$. The goal is to determine the electric field $\vec{E}$ at a point $P$ outside the conductor, which is at a distance $L$ from the center of the conductor and a distance $l$ from the center of the cavity. The angle between $l$ and $s$ is $\theta$.

Key points to consider:

1. **Induced Charges**: When the charge $+q$ is placed inside the cavity, it induces an equal and opposite charge $-q$ on the inner surface of the conductor. Since the conductor is neutral overall, the outer surface of the conductor must have a charge of $+q$ to balance the net charge.

2. **Charge Distribution**: The inner surface of the conductor, which is at a distance $s$ from the center of the cavity, has a non-uniform charge distribution because the cavity is off-center. However, the outer surface of the conductor (radius $R$) is a spherical shell, and the charge $+q$ on it will distribute uniformly due to the properties of conductors. This uniform distribution ensures that the electric field outside the conductor behaves as if all the charge were concentrated at the center of the conductor.

3. **Electric Field Outside the Conductor**: For a spherical conductor, the electric field outside the conductor depends only on the total charge on the outer surface and the distance from the center of the conductor. The field is radial and has a magnitude given by:
   \[
   E = \frac{1}{4 \pi \epsilon_0} \frac{q}{L^2}
   \]
   where $L$ is the distance from the center of the conductor to the point $P$.

4. **Irrelevance of the Cavity's Position**: The position of the cavity (and hence the induced charge on the inner surface) does not affect the electric field outside the conductor. The field is determined solely by the charge on the outer surface of the conductor, which is uniformly distributed.

5. **Analysis of Options**:
   - **Option A**: Incorrect. The expression involves $(l - s \cos\theta)^2$, which is not relevant to the electric field outside the conductor.
   - **Option B**: Correct. The electric field outside the conductor is given by $\frac{1}{4 \pi \epsilon_0} \frac{q}{L^2}$, which matches the derived result.
   - **Option C**: Incorrect. The expression involves $(l + s \cos\theta)^2$, which is not relevant to the electric field outside the conductor.
   - **Option D**: Incorrect. While the field magnitude depends on $l$, the correct expression involves $L^2$, not $l^2$.

Thus, the correct answer is **Option B**, as the electric field outside the conductor is determined by the charge on the outer surface and the distance $L$ from the center of the conductor.
