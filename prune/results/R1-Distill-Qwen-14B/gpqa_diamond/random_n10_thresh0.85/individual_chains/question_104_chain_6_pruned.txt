Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here about exoplanets and the radial velocity method. Hmm, I remember that the radial velocity method detects planets by the Doppler shift in the star's spectrum as the planet's gravity makes the star wobble. 

So the question says there are two stars with the same mass as the Sun. Each has a planet similar to Neptune, so same mass probably. The planets have circular orbits. 

Planet #1 causes a 5 milliangstrom shift, and Planet #2 causes a 7 milliangstrom shift. The question is asking how many times longer the orbital period of planet #2 is compared to planet #1.

Wait, the RV method measures the semi-amplitude of the Doppler shift. I think the semi-amplitude K is related to the mass of the planet and the star's velocity. The formula I remember is something like K = (v) = ( (G * (M_planet) ) / ( (M_star + M_planet) )^(1/3) * (P/(2π)) ) )^(1/3) )... Wait, maybe I should think about the simplified version when M_planet is much smaller than M_star, so M_star + M_planet ≈ M_star. So K is proportional to (M_planet / M_star) * (1 / (P^(1/3)) ) * (1 / sin i), but since the orbits are circular, inclination i is 90 degrees, so sin i = 1. 

Wait, but wait, the exact formula for the semi-amplitude K is K = [ (G * P) / (2π c) ]^(-1/3) * (M_planet sin i) / (M_star^(2/3)) ) ) Hmm, I might not remember that exactly, so maybe it's better to think in terms of the relationship between K and the orbital period.

If the stars are the same mass and the planets are similar, then M_planet and M_star are same for both. So K is inversely proportional to the cube root of the period. Because K = (v) is proportional to (M_planet / M_star) * (1 / (P^(1/3)) ), so K ∝ 1/(P^(1/3)). 

So if K1 is 5 and K2 is 7, then K2/K1 = 7/5 = 1.4.

Since K is inversely proportional to P^(1/3), then P is proportional to (1/K)^3.

So P2/P1 = (
