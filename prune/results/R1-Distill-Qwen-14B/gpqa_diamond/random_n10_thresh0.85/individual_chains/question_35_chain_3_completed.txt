Okay, so I've been given a quantum mechanics problem about angular momentum operators. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through it step by step.

The question is about finding the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the operator Ay. The setup is that Ay is equal to c multiplied by S, where c is h/(4π), and S is a 2x2 matrix. The matrix S has the first row as (0, -i) and the second row as (i, 0). Oh wait, that looks familiar. I think S is related to the Pauli matrices. Pauli matrices are 2x2 and are used in spin-1/2 systems like electrons or muons.

So, the given matrix S is... let me write it out:

S = [[0, -i],
     [i, 0]]

Wait, that's the sigma_y Pauli matrix multiplied by i, or maybe not? Let me recall: the Pauli matrices are:

σx = [[0, 1],
       [1, 0]]

σy = [[0, -i],
       [i, 0]]

Oh wait, yes! So S is exactly σy. Because the second row is [i, 0], which matches σy. So S is the Pauli y-matrix, σy.

Now, the operator Ay is c multiplied by S, so Ay = c σy. Since c is h/(4π), let me write that as:

Ay = (h/(4π)) * σy.

In quantum mechanics, the eigenvalues of a Pauli matrix are known. For any Pauli matrix (like σx, σy, σz), the eigenvalues are ±1. So σy has eigenvalues +1 and -1.

So the eigenvalues of σy are 1 and -1. Therefore, the eigenvalues of Ay would be c multiplied by these. That would make them (h/(4π)) * 1 and (h/(4π)) * (-1), so ± h/(4π). Wait, but looking at the options, let me check.

Looking at option A: it says the imaginary part is ±2πh, real part ±h/(4π). But wait, eigenvalues of Ay should be real because angular momentum operators are Hermitian. Wait, is that correct?

Wait a second, wait. Oh, wait: the Pauli matrices are Hermitian, so σy is Hermitian. So Ay, being c times σy, is also Hermitian because c is a real constant. So the eigenvalues should be real.

Wait, but in the given problem, the matrix S is given as [[0, -i],[i, 0]], which is indeed σy. So Ay is (h/4π) * σy. So the eigenvalues a should be ± h/(4π). So the eigenvalues are real numbers. So any option that suggests eigenvalues with imaginary parts can be ruled out, except maybe if the options are phrased differently.

Looking at the options:

Option A says eigenvalues have imaginary parts ±2πh and real parts ±h/(4π). That would make the eigenvalues complex numbers, but we just determined they should be real. So option A is incorrect.

Option B: the eigen values have imaginary parts of ½ or -½, and real parts 1 or -1. But again, eigenvalues are real, so this can't be right since they're talking about the imaginary part. So B is out.

Option C: The eigenfunction of Ay can also be an eigenfunction of A², but not of Az. Hmm, wait. A is the angular momentum operator. In quantum mechanics, for spin systems, the square of the angular momentum (A²) commutes with each component (like Az). So if a state is an eigenfunction of Ay, it's not necessarily an eigenfunction of Az, but it would be an eigenfunction of A². Because A² is the Casimir operator and commutes with all components. So option C sounds correct. Because eigenfunctions of Ay (which is a component) can be eigenfunctions of A², but not necessarily of another component like Az. So C is a plausible option.

Option D: The eigenfunctions φ are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay. Hmm, I'm not sure. The basis functions would probably be the eigenvectors of the operator. Since Ay is a 2x2 matrix, its eigenvectors form a basis for the space, so the eigenfunctions are the basis functions. So D says that, which is correct. But wait, is that necessarily the case? For any 2x2 matrix, its eigenvectors (if they exist) form a basis, so the eigenfunctions φ would form the basis. So D sounds correct.

Wait, but let's clarify the question. The question is during the calculation, which statement is correct. So the possible statements are A, B, C, D.

So before jumping to conclusions, let's think about each option.

We've determined that the eigenvalues of Ay are ± h/(4π). So real numbers. Therefore, options A and B, which have imaginary parts in their eigenvalues, are incorrect. That leaves us with options C and D.

Option C says the eigenfunction of Ay can also be an eigenfunction of A², but not of Az. So, in quantum mechanics, for spin systems, the square of the angular momentum (A²) commutes with any component, so any eigenstate of Ay is also an eigenstate of A². But it's not an eigenstate of Az because Ay and Az don't commute. So C is correct.

Option D says the eigenfunctions φ are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay. So, if Ay is a 2x2 matrix, and φ are its eigenfunctions (eigenvectors), then yes, they form a basis for the 2-dimensional space. So D is correct as well.

Wait, but the answer can only be one of the options. So let me re-examine the options.

Wait, the question is which statement is correct during the calculation. So perhaps both C and D are correct, but let me read the options carefully.

Option C: The eigenfunction of the operator Ay can also be an eigenfunction of A^2, but not of the Z-component, Az.

Option D: The eigenfunctions φ of the operator Ay are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay given above.

Wait, D says that the eigenfunctions are the basis functions of the matrix operator. So the matrix operator Ay is represented in the eigenbasis of its eigenfunctions. Therefore, in that basis, Ay would be diagonal. So yes, the eigenfunctions form the basis for the operator.

So both C and D could be correct statements.

Wait, but the question is which statement is correct. So perhaps both C and D are correct, but the options are such that only one is correct.

Wait, let me think again about the question. The problem is about the intrinsic angular momentum of a muon. So, for a spin-1/2 particle, the angular momentum components have eigenvalues ± ħ/2. Wait, but wait, the muon is a lepton, so it's spin-1/2.

Wait, but in this problem, the operator Ay is given as c times S, where c is h/(4π) and S is σy.

Wait, but the standard spin matrices for spin-1/2 particles are (σx, σy, σz) scaled by ħ/2. Because the eigenvalues of the spin matrices are ± ħ/2.

Wait, hold on. The standard spin operator S_i is (ħ/2) σ_i. So, for example, Sx = (ħ/2) σx, which has eigenvalues ± ħ/2.

In this problem, Ay is given as c multiplied by S, where c is h/(4π) and S is a 2x2 matrix (σy). So substituting, Ay = (h/(4π)) * σy.

But h is Planck's constant, which is 2πħ. So h = 2πħ.

Substituting h = 2πħ into c: c = (2πħ)/(4π) ) = ħ/2. So Ay = (ħ/2) * σy. That's exactly the standard spin operator Sy, which has eigenvalues ± ħ/2.

Wait, so earlier I thought the eigenvalues would be ± h/(4π). But substituting h = 2πħ, we get:

h/(4π) = (2πħ) / (4π) ) = (2π ħ) / (4π) )= ħ/(2).

So the eigenvalues of Ay are ± ħ/2. So when we have the eigenvalue equation Ay φ = a φ, a is ± ħ/2.

Wait, but looking back at the options, none of the options directly mention this. Let me check the options again.

Looking at option B: eigenvalues have imaginary parts ±1/2, real parts ±1. No, that's not matching the eigenvalues ± ħ/2. But ħ is approximately 1.05e-34 J·s, but in terms of units, perhaps the problem is using h instead of ħ?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in substitution. Let me recalculate:

c = h/(4π).

So Ay = c * S = (h/(4π)) σy.

The eigenvalues for σy are ±1, so the eigenvalues of Ay would be (h/(4π)) * (±1), so ± h/(4π). But h = 2π ħ. So substituting:

h/(4π) = (2π ħ) / (4π) )= (2 π ħ ) / (4 π ) ) = ( ħ ) / 2.

So exactly, the eigenvalues are ± ħ/2. So it's ± ħ/2. So in terms of the problem, the eigenvalues of Ay are ± ħ/2.

But the options don't state that. Let me check the options again.

Option A: eigenvalues have imaginary parts ±2πh, real parts ±h/(4π). So complex eigenvalues. Not possible, as we said earlier. So A is wrong.

Option B: imaginary parts ±1/2, real parts ±1. Also complex, so B is wrong.

Option C: The eigenfunctions of Ay can also be eigenfunctions of A², but not of Az. As discussed earlier, this is correct.

Option D: The eigenfunctions of Ay are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay. That's correct as well, because the eigenfunctions form an orthogonal basis for the space, which is necessary for the matrix representation.

Wait, but the question is which statement is correct during the calculation. So perhaps both C and D are correct, but looking at the options, the correct answers are C and D.

Wait, but the question is multiple-choice with four options. Let me read the options again.

Looking at D: The eigenfunctions φ of the operator Ay are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay given above.

Wait, the matrix operator is given in the basis of the standard basis vectors (I assume). So the eigenfunctions (eigenvectors) of Ay form an orthogonal basis for the 2x2 space, so D is correct.

So, but the question asks which statement is correct during the calculation. So which of the options is correct.

Wait, but looking back at the problem statement, perhaps I need to reevaluate.

The problem says Ay is a 2x2 matrix operator. So eigenfunctions (eigenvectors) of Ay would form a basis for the space, so D is correct.

But in quantum mechanics, the eigenstates of a component of angular momentum (say, Ay) are not eigenstates of another component, like Az, unless they commute, which they don't. So option C is correct as well.

So both C and D seem correct. But let me look at the options again.

Wait, let me look at option D more carefully: The eigenfunctions φ of the operator Ay are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay given above.

So, the matrix operator is represented in the standard basis (the basis functions are the standard basis vectors). The eigenfunctions are the eigenvectors of Ay, which form another basis, probably not the same as the standard basis unless Ay is diagonal in the standard basis.

But in this case, S is σy, which is not diagonal in the standard basis. So the eigenfunctions are not the standard basis, but they do form a basis for the vector space.

So D says the eigenfunctions are the basis functions of the operator. Hmm. The basis functions usually refer to the basis in which the operator is diagonal. So if the operator is diagonal in its eigenbasis, then the eigenfunctions are the basis functions of the operator's representation.

But in this case, the operator is given in the standard basis. Its eigenfunctions are not the standard basis vectors but form another basis.

So perhaps option D is not correct, because the eigenfunctions are not the same as the basis functions of the operator as given. The operator is represented in a different basis.

Wait, but wait. The operator is given in a certain basis (probably the computational basis). The eigenfunctions are vectors that form a different basis. So if the eigenfunctions are the basis functions of the matrix operator, that would mean that the operator is diagonal in that basis. So the statement in D would be correct in that sense.

Alternatively, perhaps D is correct because any set of eigenvectors forms a basis for the space, regardless of the operator's representation.

Hmm, I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let me think about the question again.

The problem asks which statement is correct during the calculation of the eigenvalues and eigenvectors.

Option C says the eigenfunctions of Ay can also be eigenfunctions of A² but not Az. As we discussed earlier, this is correct because A² commutes with Ay, so any eigenstate of Ay is also an eigenstate of A². But since Ay and Az don't commute, the eigenfunctions of Ay are not eigenfunctions of Az. So option C is a correct statement.

Option D says that the eigenfunctions are the basis functions of the matrix operator. The matrix operator is given in a specific basis (presumably the computational basis). The eigenfunctions form another basis (eigenbasis), so D would be correct if the eigenfunctions are the basis in which the operator is diagonal. But in the standard basis, the operator isn't diagonal, so D's statement is that the eigenfunctions are the basis functions, which is correct because any set of eigenvectors forms a basis. So D is correct as well.

Wait, but the question is which statement is correct. So perhaps both C and D are correct. But the options are A, B, C, D, and only one is correct.

Wait, but the problem is about the eigenvalues and eigenvectors. So perhaps none of the options are correct. But that can't be, since the question expects one correct option.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in my earlier analysis.

Wait, let's think about the eigenvalues again. We have:

Ay = (h/(4π)) σy.

σy has eigenvalues ±1. So Ay's eigenvalues are (h/(4π))*(±1) = ± h/(4π).

But h is 2πħ, so substituting:

± h/(4π) = ± (2πħ) / (4π) ) = ± ħ/2.

So the eigenvalues are ± ħ/2, which are real numbers.

So the eigenvalues have no imaginary parts. Thus, any option that suggests eigenvalues have imaginary parts is incorrect. So options A and B are wrong, as I thought earlier.

Now, looking again at option C: The eigenfunctions of Ay can also be eigenfunctions of A², but not Az.

Yes, because A² commutes with Ay, so they share eigenfunctions. But Az does not commute with Ay, so they don't share eigenfunctions. So option C is correct.

Option D: The eigenfunctions are the basis functions of the matrix operator. That depends on the context. The operator is given in a certain basis, but the eigenfunctions form another basis. So the eigenfunctions can be considered as the basis functions for their own space, which is the same as the space of the operator. So D is correct.

But the question is which statement is correct. So I have two options, C and D, which seem correct.

Wait, but looking back, perhaps the way the question is phrased, only one option is correct.

Wait, let me think about option D again. The eigenfunctions are the basis functions of the matrix operator. The matrix operator is 2x2, so the eigenfunctions (eigenvectors) are vectors in a 2D space. They form a basis for that space, which is the same space in which the operator is represented. So the statement in D is correct because any set of eigenvectors forms a basis for the vector space on which the operator acts. So whether the operator is represented in that basis or another is a separate issue. So D is correct.

But wait, the question is during the calculation of eigenvalues and eigenvectors. So the statement in D is about the matrix operator's basis functions. The matrix operator is given as a 2x2 matrix, which is already in a basis. The eigenfunctions, being eigenvectors, form another basis. So perhaps D is not correct because the eigenfunctions are not the same as the basis in which the operator is given, but they form another basis.

Alternatively, perhaps the term "basis functions of the matrix operator" refers to the basis in which the operator is diagonal, which is the eigenbasis. So D is correct.

But I'm getting a bit stuck on this. Let me try to think differently.

In quantum mechanics, the eigenstates of an operator form an orthonormal basis for the space. So for a 2x2 matrix, the two eigenvectors (assuming they're non-degenerate) will form a basis. So statement D is correct because the eigenfunctions indeed form a basis, which is the basis for the operator's matrix representation. So in that sense, D is correct.

But then, considering all this, both C and D seem correct. However, the options are given as four separate choices, and the correct answer must be one of them.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let me re-express the operator in terms of the Pauli matrices:

Ay = c * σy = (h/(4π)) σy.

The eigenvalues of σy are ±1, so the eigenvalues of Ay are (h/(4π)) * (±1) = ± h/(4π).

But earlier, I substituted h = 2π ħ. So substituting:

h/(4π) = (2π ħ) / (4π) )= ħ/2.

So the eigenvalues are ± ħ/2. These are real numbers. So the eigenvalues have no imaginary parts.

So options A and B are incorrect because they suggest complex eigenvalues.

So I'm back to options C and D.

Option C: The eigenfunction of Ay can be an eigenfunction of A² but not Az.

Yes, so this is correct.

Option D: The eigenfunctions are the basis functions of the matrix operator.

This is also correct because the operator's matrix is 2x2, and the eigenfunctions form a basis for that space. So D is correct.

Wait, but can both be correct? Let me think again.

The question is about which statement is correct during the calculation. So perhaps the correct answer is C and D.

But looking at the options, perhaps only C is correct.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me go back to the question.

The question is, during the calculation, which statement is correct.

So, during the calculation of the eigenvalues and eigenvectors, what do we find?

We find that the eigenvalues are real (so any option suggesting complex eigenvalues is wrong). So A and B are wrong.

C says the eigenfunctions can be eigenfunctions of A², but not Az. That's correct, so C is correct.

D says the eigenfunctions are the basis functions of the operator. That's correct because the eigenfunctions form a basis, so D is correct.

So both C and D seem correct. But looking again, perhaps only one is correct.

Wait, the question is a multiple-choice with four options, so the correct answer is either C or D.

But how can I decide between them?

Another approach: think about the properties of the eigenfunctions.

In quantum mechanics, the eigenfunctions of a Hermitian operator form a basis. So D is correct because the eigenfunctions form a basis for the space. So D is correct.

But option C also states a correct fact. So perhaps both C and D are correct, but among the options, the correct answer is C or D.

Wait, but the options are given as separate choices. So perhaps the correct answer is option C.

Alternatively, perhaps I should re-examine the options.

Wait, the problem statement says that the matrix operator S is given, and Ay = c S.

So the matrix is 2x2, so the eigenvectors are two-dimensional vectors. The eigenfunctions (eigenvectors) form a basis for R^2, thus forming the basis functions of the operator. So D is correct.

But, if the operator is diagonal in that basis, then yes, D is correct.

So, to sum up, both options C and D seem correct, but given the way the options are presented, perhaps the correct answer is option C.


The problem involves calculating the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the operator \( A_y \), which is defined as \( A_y = c \cdot S \), where \( c = \frac{h}{4\pi} \) and \( S \) is the Pauli \( y \)-matrix:

\[
S = \begin{bmatrix} 0 & -i \\ i & 0 \end{bmatrix}.
\]

### Key Analysis:

1. **Eigenvalues of \( A_y \):**
   - The Pauli \( y \)-matrix \( S \) has eigenvalues \( \pm 1 \).
   - Since \( A_y = c \cdot S \), the eigenvalues of \( A_y \) are \( \pm c \), which are \( \pm \frac{h}{4\pi} \).
   - Substituting \( h = 2\pi \hbar \), the eigenvalues become \( \pm \frac{\hbar}{2} \), which are real numbers.
   - Therefore, any option suggesting complex eigenvalues (e.g., options A and B) is incorrect.

2. **Option C:**
   - The eigenfunctions of \( A_y \) can also be eigenfunctions of \( A^2 \) (the square of the angular momentum operator), because \( A^2 \) commutes with all components of angular momentum, including \( A_y \).
   - However, the eigenfunctions of \( A_y \) are not eigenfunctions of \( A_z \) (the \( z \)-component of angular momentum), because \( A_y \) and \( A_z \) do not commute.
   - This statement is correct.

3. **Option D:**
   - The eigenfunctions of \( A_y \) (its eigenvectors) form a basis for the 2D vector space in which the operator is represented. This is true because any set of eigenvectors of a 2x2 matrix forms a basis for the space.
   - However, the eigenfunctions are not the same as the basis in which the operator is originally represented (the standard basis). The eigenfunctions form a different basis (the eigenbasis of \( A_y \)).
   - Despite this subtlety, the statement in option D is correct because the eigenfunctions do indeed form a basis for the space.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - Both options C and D are correct. However, since the question asks for the correct statement during the calculation, option C is the most relevant, as it directly addresses the relationship between \( A_y \), \( A^2 \), and \( A_z \).

### Final Answer:
Answer: C
