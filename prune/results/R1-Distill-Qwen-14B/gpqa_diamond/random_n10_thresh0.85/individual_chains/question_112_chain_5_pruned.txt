Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this stuff, but let's try to think it through step by step. The question is about finding the probabilities of measuring an electron in certain states and the average value of an operator. Hmm.

Alright, the state is given as |alpha> proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2 - i)|down>. Wait, so first I probably need to normalize this state because right now it's just proportional. So I'll have to find the normalization constant.

The normalization factor is 1 over the square root of the sum of the squares of the absolute values of the coefficients. Let me calculate each coefficient's magnitude squared. For the |up> part, the coefficient is (1+i), so its magnitude squared is (1)^2 + (1)^2 = 2. For the |down> part, the coefficient is (2 - i), so the magnitude squared is (2)^2 + (-1)^2 = 4 + 1 =5. So the sum is 2 +5 =7. So the normalization factor is 1/sqrt(7). Therefore, |alpha> is (1+i)/sqrt(7) |up> + (2 -i)/sqrt(7) |down>.

Next, the operator whose matrix elements are given by A_ij. Let me think about what that matrix looks like. The operator A has elements A_ij = hbar/2 when i≠j and 0 otherwise. Since |up> and |down> are the eigenstates of the z-component, the basis is { |up>, |down> }, so the matrix is 2x2. So the diagonal elements (i=j) are 0, and the off-diagonal elements (i≠j) are hbar/2. So the matrix is:
[ 0      hbar/2 ]
[ hbar/2  0     ]

Wait, but this matrix is for the operator in the z-basis. To find the eigenstates of this operator, perhaps I should diagonalize it. Because the measurement probabilities depend on the eigenstates of the operator. Because when you measure an operator, the possible outcomes are the eigenvalues, and the probability is the square of the amplitude of the eigenstate in the state |alpha>.

Wait, right. So the operator A is given, and the problem says "eigenstates of the operator". So I need to find the eigenvectors of matrix A.

So, let me denote the matrix as:

0   a
a   0

where a = hbar/2.

The eigenvalues are found by solving det(A - λ I)=0.

So determinant of [ -λ      a     ]
                [ a     -λ ] = λ² - a² = 0.

So λ² = a² → λ = ±a.

So the eigenvalues are λ_+ = a = hbar/2, and λ_- = -a = -hbar/2.

Now, the corresponding eigenvectors.

For λ = a:

(A - a I) v = 0.

Which is:

[ -a   a ] [v1]   [0]
[ a  -a ] [v2] = [0]

So the equations are -a v1 + a v2 = 0 → v1 = v2.

So the eigenvector can be written as (1,1) up to a scalar. But we can normalize it. The eigenvector is (1,1)/sqrt(2), but wait, since a is hbar/2, but in the matrix, a is hbar/2. Wait, no, the eigenvectors don't depend on a because when a is factored out, it cancels in the equations. So the eigenvectors are just (1,1) and (1,-1), normalized.

Wait, for λ = a, the equations give v1 = v2. So the eigenvector is proportional to (1,1). Normalizing, it's (1,1)/sqrt(2).

Similarly, for λ = -a, the equations are -(-a) v1 + a v2 = 0 → a v1 + a v2 =0 → v1 = -v2. So the eigenvector is (1,-1)/sqrt(2).

So the eigenstates of operator A are |+> = (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2) and |-> = (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2). Wait, but wait, wait a second, the operator A is given as A_ij = hbar/2 when i≠j and 0 otherwise. So the matrix is [[0, hbar/2], [hbar/2, 0]]. So that's like sigma_x multiplied by hbar/2, because sigma_x is [[0,1],[1,0]]. So the operator is (hbar/2) sigma_x.

Ah, right, so the eigenstates are the same as sigma_x's eigenstates, which are the eigenstates of the Pauli X matrix. So indeed, |+> is (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2) and |-> is (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2).

So the probability of measuring the operator A in state |alpha> is the square of the amplitude of each eigenstate |+> and |-> in |alpha>.

Wait, so to find the probabilities, I need to express |alpha> in terms of |+> and |->.

Alternatively, since |alpha> is in the z-basis, perhaps it's easier to compute the overlap with each of the eigenstates |+> and |->.

Wait, let me write |alpha> as:

|alpha> = [ (1+i)/sqrt(7) ] |up> + [ (2 - i)/sqrt(7) ] |down>.

And the eigenstates |+> and |-> are:

|+> = 1/sqrt(2) (|up> + |down> )

|-> = 1/sqrt(2) (|up> - |down> )

So to find the amplitude
