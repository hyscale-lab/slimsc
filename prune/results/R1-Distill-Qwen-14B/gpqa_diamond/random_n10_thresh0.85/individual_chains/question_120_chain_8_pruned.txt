Okay, so I've got this question about stars being uniformly distributed in the sky and how the number of stars per unit range of parallax changes with parallax. Hmm, I need to figure this out. Let me think.

First, I remember that parallax is related to distance. Oh right, the formula for parallax is plx = 1/d, where d is the distance in parsecs. So as distance increases, parallax decreases. That makes sense because closer stars have larger parallaxes.

Wait, the question is about the number of stars per unit range of parallax. Oh, so it's asking how the density of stars changes as parallax changes. But wait, stars are uniformly distributed. So their actual density in space is uniform.

Parallax is inversely proportional to distance. So if I have a small range of parallax, say from plx to plx + dplx, what's the corresponding distance range? Let's see, plx = 1/d → d = 1/plx. So if plx increases by dplx, then d would change as d = 1/(plx + dplx) but I'm not sure if that's the right approach. Maybe I should think about the volume element.

In space, the number of stars depends on the volume, right? Since they're uniformly distributed, the number density is constant. So for a shell at distance d with thickness dr, the volume is 4πd² dr. The number of stars in this shell would be proportional to 4πd² dr.

Now, I need to relate this to parallax. So parallax plx = 1/d → d = 1/plx. Let me compute the volume in terms of parallax. The range of parallax would be from plx to plx + dplx. The corresponding distance range is from d = 1/plx to d + dd, where dd is the change in distance. Wait, how does dd relate to dplx?

Because plx = 1/d → d = 1/plx. So dd = derivative of d with respect to plx times dplx. The derivative of d with respect to plx is d/dd (1/plx) = -1/(plx²). So dd = (-1/(plx²)) * dplx. But since dplx is a small positive increment, the negative sign just indicates that as plx increases, d decreases. The magnitude is dd = dplx / plx².

Hmm, but I'm trying to find the number of stars per unit parallax. So the volume element in terms of parallax would be the volume of a spherical shell at distance d with thickness dd. The volume is 4π d² dd. Substituting d = 1/plx and dd = dplx / plx².

Let me compute that:

d squared is (1/plx)^2 → 1/plx².

dd is dplx / plx^2.

So the volume element becomes 4π * (1/plx²) * (dplx/plx²) ) = 4π dplx / plx^4.

Wait, number of stars is proportional to volume, so the number of stars in a dplx range is proportional to 1/plx^4 multiplied by dplx.

But the question is the number per unit range of parallax. So per dplx, the number is proportional to 1/plx^4.

Wait, but wait a second. The question says "number of stars per unit range of parallax (plx) changes with plx." So it's the number per dplx, which as I found is proportional to 1/plx^4. So the number density in the plx space is ~1/plx^4.

Looking at the options, option A is ~1/plx^4. So that's the answer?

Wait, another approach: think about how the volume per unit parallax changes.

Since volume scales with d^3, and d is inversely proportional to plx, then d^3 is 1/plx^3. But wait, wait. The volume element in terms of parallax.

Alternatively, the number density in space is uniform, so the number of stars in a volume element dV is
