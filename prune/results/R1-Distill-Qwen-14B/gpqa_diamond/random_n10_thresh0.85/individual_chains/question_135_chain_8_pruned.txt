Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it carefully. 

The problem is about the decay of a boson X. The Lagrangian is given as L(y) = -λ_f ψ̄_f (y) (v + X(y)) ψ_f(y). Hmm, wait, I think I might have misread that. Let me check again. Oh, right, it's L(y) = -λ ψ̄_f (y) (v + X(y)) ψ_f(y). So this looks like an interaction term. The boson X is interacting with fermions, and the mass of X is 6 GeV. The question is about the kinematically allowed decays of X at the lowest order.

Wait, so boson X can decay into fermion-antifermion pairs, right? Because in the Lagrangian, the interaction term is something like X ψ̄ ψ. That suggests that X can annihilate or create fermion pairs. So the decay would be X → f f̄.

Now, the mass of X is 6 GeV. So when X decays, the total energy must be enough to produce the fermion pair. So each fermion must have a mass less than or equal to half of X's mass, because X is at rest when it decays, right? So the maximum mass each fermion can have is 3 GeV, because 6 GeV divided by 2 is 3 GeV.

Wait, but I remember that the masses of the known fermions are much less than that. Let's list the masses of the common fermions:

- Up quark (u): around 2.2 MeV
- Down quark (d): around 4.7 MeV
- Strange quark (s): about 95-100 MeV
- Charm quark (c): about 1.3 GeV
- Bottom quark (b): about 4.5 GeV
- Top quark (t): way too heavy, around 173 GeV.
- Electron (e): ~0.511 MeV
- Muon (μ): ~105.7 MeV
- Tau (τ): ~1.78 GeV
- Neutrinos are even lighter, but I don't think they're considered here because the problem doesn't mention them.

Wait, so X's mass is 6 GeV. So each fermion in the decay pair must have a mass less than or equal to 3 GeV. Let's see which fermions satisfy m_f ≤ 3 GeV.

Looking at the quarks:

- u, d, s, c: all their masses are below 3 GeV. So their antiquarks and themselves are possible decay products.
- b is about 4.5 GeV, which is more than 3 GeV. So b quark is too heavy. So X can't decay into b b̄, because each b would need 4.5 GeV, but X only has 6 GeV, so 3 GeV per fermion would be
