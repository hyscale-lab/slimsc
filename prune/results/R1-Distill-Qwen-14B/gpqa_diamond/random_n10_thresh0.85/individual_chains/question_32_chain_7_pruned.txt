Okay, so I've got this physics problem about the energy of the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) where the speed of a nucleus is 0.96c. The nucleus in question is Li with 3 neutrons. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on heavy ion colliders, but let's try to break this down step by step.

First off, I need to figure out the mass of the nucleus X. X is Li-6, I think, because Li usually has 3 neutrons when it's Li-6. Wait, no, wait. Wait, natural lithium has isotopes. Li-7 is more common, but the question says 3 neutrons. Oh right, Li has 3 protons normally. So 3 protons plus 3 neutrons gives a mass number of 6, so it's Li-6. So the nucleus is a lithium-6 nucleus.

So the mass of the nucleus X is the mass of Li-6. I remember that the mass of a nucleus can be calculated using the mass number. The mass number A is protons + neutrons. So here, A = 3 + 3 =6. So the nucleus is 6Li.

Now, I need the mass of 6Li. Wait, in particle physics, we often use atomic mass units or convert it into energy using E=mc². But I think the standard approach is to use the rest mass energy of the nucleus. Alternatively, because the nucleus is moving at a relativistic speed, we might need to calculate its total energy, which includes kinetic energy.

Wait, the problem says the energy of the collider is what? I think the RHIC accelerates ions to a certain energy, which is usually the kinetic energy per ion. Or wait, wait, sometimes when they say the energy of the collider, they mean the kinetic energy each ion has. But I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, sometimes it's the total energy (rest mass plus kinetic), but I think for heavy ions, when they talk about the collider's energy, it's the kinetic energy each ion has. Or maybe it's the total energy (gamma * m c²). Hmm, I'm getting a bit confused here.

Wait, I should think about the formula for total energy. The total energy E of a particle is gamma times m c squared. Gamma is the Lorentz factor, which is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²). Because the speed is 0.96c, so v=0.96c.

So first, let's compute gamma. Gamma is 1 divided by sqrt(1 - (v²/c²)). Plugging in v=0.96c:

v² = (0.96c)^2 = 0.9216 c². So 1 - v²/c² = 1 - 0.9216 = 0.0784.

So sqrt(0.0784) is, let's see. 0.28^2 is 0.0784, so sqrt(0.0784) is 0.28. Therefore, gamma is 1/0.28 ≈ 3.5714.

Wait, 0.28 squared is 0.0784? Let me double-check. 0.28 * 0.28 = 0.0784, yes. So that's correct.

So gamma is 1/0.28 ≈ 3.57142857. Approximately 3.5714.

Now, the rest mass energy of the Li-6 nucleus. The atomic mass of Li-6 is approximately... Hmm. The mass of a single nucleon (proton or neutron) is about 938 MeV/c². So for 6 nucleons, 6 * 938 ≈ 5628 MeV, which is 5.628 GeV.

Wait, but wait. The actual mass of Li-6 is a bit less than 6 nucleons because when they form the nucleus, some mass is converted into binding energy. So the mass of the nucleus is less than 6 * 938 MeV.

Wait, no. Wait, the mass of the nucleus is the sum of the masses of its nucleons minus the mass defect (
