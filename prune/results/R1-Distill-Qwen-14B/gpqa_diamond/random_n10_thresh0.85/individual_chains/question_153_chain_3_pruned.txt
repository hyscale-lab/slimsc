Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here about the Michael addition reaction. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to think it through.

The question has three parts, A, B, and C, each involving different reactants and products. The options give possible products for each part, so I need to figure out what each reaction yields and then match them to the options.

Starting with part A: dimethyl malonate reacting with methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate in the presence of NaOEt (sodium ethoxide) and EtOH (ethanol). Wait, right, sodium ethoxide is a strong base, so this is likely deprotonating something to form an enolate.

Michael addition involves the enolate of a nucleophile attacking an alpha, beta-unsaturated carbonyl compound. So dimethyl malonate is a good nucleophile because it can form an enolate. The other compound, methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate, is the Michael acceptor since it's an alpha, beta-unsaturated carbonyl.

So the enolate from dimethyl malonate will attack the beta position of the acrylate. Dimethyl malonate is CH2(COOEt)2. When it forms an enolate, the negative charge is on the central carbon. So the attack would be at the beta carbon of the acrylate.

The structure of methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate is probably something like CH2=CH-C(p-tolyl)-OEt. When the enolate attacks the beta carbon (the CH2 part), it'll add the malonate group there.

Wait, the attack would substitute the hydrogen on the beta carbon. So the acrylate has a double bond between carbons 1 and 2, the substituent is on carbon 3. So the structure is CH2=C(C(p-tolyl))OEt? No, wait, perhaps it's CH2=CH-C-OEt, but with the p-tolyl on the third carbon? Maybe it's CH2=CH-CH(p-tolyl)OEt? Or perhaps I'm mixing that up.

Wait, the formula is methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate. Acrylate is CH2=CHCOOEt, but in this case, the substituent is at position 3, so it's CH2=CH-CH2-OEt with the p-tolyl on the third carbon? Or wait, acrylate is CH2=CHCOOEt. So 3-(p-tolyl)acrylate would mean the p-tolyl is attached to the third carbon of the acrylate. Hmm, that doesn't make sense because acrylate is three carbons (CH2=CH-CO-OEt), so maybe it's CH2=CH-C(p-tolyl)OEt. Wait, that would be 3-(p-tolyl)acrylate, but I'm a bit confused about the structure.

Alternatively, perhaps it's (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate, meaning the structure is CH2=C(p-tolyl)COOEt. No, wait, acrylate is CH2=CHCOOEt. 3-(p-tolyl) would add a substituent to the third carbon, but the acrylate only has three carbons. So maybe it's CH2=CH-CH2-OEt with a p-tolyl on the third carbon? Or perhaps it's (E)-CH2-CH=C(p-tolyl)OEt? No, that's probably not right.

Wait, perhaps the structure is CH2=CH-CO-OEt, but with the p-tolyl group attached to the middle carbon. So the double bond is between C1 and C2, and the COOEt is on C3. So the structure is CH2=CH-C(p-tolyl)OEt? No, because that would make it 2-p-tolylpropenoate, perhaps.

Wait, maybe it's CH2=CH-CH2-OEt with a p-tolyl group on the third carbon. So the structure is CH2=CH-CH2-O-p-tolyl? No, that's not right. Alternatively, perhaps it's (E)-methyl 3-(p-tolyl)acrylate, which would have the structure CH2=C(p-tolyl)COOEt. That would make sense. The double bond is between C2 and C3, with the p-tolyl on C3 and the COOEt on C2. So the correct structure is CH2=C(p-tolyl)-COOEt, but wait, in that case, the double bond is between C1 and C2, and the p-tolyl is on C1, while COOEt is on C2. Hmm, maybe I'm getting this wrong.

Alternatively, maybe the structure is CH2=C(CO2Me)-CH2-p-tolyl. No, that can't be right.

Wait, maybe it's (E)-3-(p-t
