Okay, so I have this physics problem here about a relativistic harmonic oscillator. Hmm, I remember that in classical mechanics, a harmonic oscillator's maximum speed can be found using energy conservation. But wait, this is relativistic, so I should probably think about how relativity affects the equations.

The question says it's a 1-dimensional oscillator with mass m and maximum amplitude A. It obeys Hooke's law, F = -kx. We need to find the maximum speed v_max. Oh right, in relativity, the equations are a bit different because of the Lorentz factor and energy considerations.

In the non-relativistic case, maximum speed occurs when all potential energy is converted into kinetic energy. For a harmonic oscillator, the potential energy is (1/2)kA², and the kinetic energy is (1/2)mv². So equating them: (1/2)kA² = (1/2)mv² → v = sqrt(kA²/m). That's option C, but this is relativistic, so probably not the correct answer.

But wait, relativity comes into play when speeds are a significant fraction of the speed of light. So the kinetic energy in relativity isn't (1/2)mv² anymore. The relativistic kinetic energy is (γ-1)mc², where γ is the Lorentz factor, γ = 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²).

So let's set the total energy equal to the sum of rest mass energy and kinetic energy. Wait, but for small amplitudes, the classical approach works, but here it's at maximum amplitude, so perhaps relativistic effects are significant.

The total energy in the oscillator is conserved. At maximum displacement (x=A), the velocity is zero, so all energy is potential. Wait, no: in the harmonic oscillator, potential energy is (1/2)kA², but in relativistic terms, does that hold? Hmm, wait, the force is still F = -kx, so the potential energy would still be (1/2)kx², right? But when the mass is moving, the kinetic energy is relativistic.

So at any point in the motion, the total energy E is the sum of kinetic and potential energy. At maximum amplitude, the velocity is zero, so E = potential energy = (1/2)kA². When the mass passes through the equilibrium point, all that potential energy is converted into kinetic energy. So E = relativistic kinetic energy + rest mass energy.

Wait, relativistic kinetic energy is (γ-1)mc². So E = (γ -1 ) mc² + mc² = γ mc². So E is also (1/2)kA², because that's the potential energy at maximum displacement.

So setting them equal: γ mc² = (1/2) k A².

Wait, wait, no. At maximum displacement, all the energy is potential. So E = (1/2) k A². But wait, in the relativistic case, does the potential energy expression change? Hmm, I'm a bit confused here.

Alternatively, perhaps the total mechanical energy is (1/2) k A², but in the relativistic scenario, the kinetic energy is (γ -1) mc². So when the mass is at x=0, all the energy is kinetic, so (1/2)kA² = (γ -1) mc².

So,

γ = 1 + (1/(2m)) k A² / c².

Because,

γ = 1 + ( (1/2) k A² ) / (m c² )

So,

γ = 1 + (k A²) / (2 m c²).

Hmm, γ is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²), which can be rewritten as γ² = 1/(1 - v²/c²).

So,

γ² = [1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²)]².

But wait, no. Let me recheck the algebra.

γ = 1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²).

So,

1/ sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = 1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²).

Taking reciprocal of both sides,

sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = 1 / [1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²)].

Squaring both sides,

1 - v²/c² = 1 / [1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²)]².

Then, solving for v²/c²,

v²/c² = 1 - [1 / (1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²))² ].

Hmm, so that's the expression for v²/c².

Wait, but looking at the options, let me see:

Option D: v_max = c * sqrt(1 - 1/(1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²))² )

Wait, that would give v²/c² = 1 - [1/(1 + ... )² ].

Which matches what I have.

Wait, but looking at the options:

Option D says v_max = c * sqrt(1 - 1/(1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2) )^2 )

Yes, that's exactly what I have.

So the maximum speed is option D.

Wait, let me check the other options.

Option A: sqrt(1 + something), which would be greater than c, which can't be.

Option B: sqrt(1 + 1/(...) ), but I'm not sure.

Option C is non-relativistic, so maybe not correct.

So the correct answer is D.


To determine the maximum speed \( v_{\text{max}} \) of a 1-dimensional relativistic harmonic oscillator with mass \( m \), maximum amplitude \( A \), and obeying Hooke's law \( F = -kx \), we use relativistic energy conservation. The total energy \( E \) of the system is conserved and equals the potential energy at maximum displacement, \( E = \frac{1}{2}kA^2 \). At the equilibrium position, all this energy is converted into relativistic kinetic energy, which is given by:

\[
E = (\gamma - 1)mc^2,
\]

where \( \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}} \) is the Lorentz factor. Equating the total energy, we have:

\[
\gamma mc^2 = \frac{1}{2}kA^2.
\]

Rearranging for \( \gamma \), we get:

\[
\gamma = 1 + \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}.
\]

Substituting \( \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}} \), we find:

\[
\frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}} = 1 + \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}.
\]

Taking the reciprocal and squaring both sides:

\[
1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2} = \frac{1}{\left(1 + \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}\right)^2}.
\]

Solving for \( v^2/c^2 \):

\[
\frac{v^2}{c^2} = 1 - \frac{1}{\left(1 + \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}\right)^2}.
\]

Thus, the maximum speed is:

\[
v_{\text{max}} = c \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{\left(1 + \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}\right)^2}}.
\]

Now, analyzing the options:

- **Option A** and **Option B** involve terms with \( \sqrt{1 + \dots} \), which would imply speeds greater than \( c \), violating the speed limit of relativity. Hence, these are incorrect.
- **Option C** corresponds to the non-relativistic case, which does not account for relativistic effects. Thus, it is also incorrect.
- **Option D** matches the derived expression for \( v_{\text{max}} \), making it the correct choice.

Answer: D
