Okay, so I have this physics problem here about the energy of the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) when the nucleus is moving at 0.96c. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's think through it.

First, the question says the nucleus is X, which is Li with 3 neutrons. Wait, Li is lithium. The common isotope is Li-7, right? Because lithium has 3 protons, so with 3 neutrons, it's 3+3=6 nucleons? Wait, 3 protons and 3 neutrons would make it Li-6. Oh wait, Li has an atomic number of 3. So if X has 3 neutrons, the total nucleons are 3 (protons) + 3 (neutrons) = 6. So the nucleus is Li-6, which has a mass number of 6.

Wait, no. Wait, Li is element 3, so if it has 3 neutrons, the isotope is Li-6 because 3 protons +3 neutrons =6. Yes, that makes sense. So the mass of the nucleus is that of a Li-6 nucleus.

But in terms of mass, when dealing with high-energy physics, we often use the rest mass energy of the nucleus. Or wait, perhaps when calculating the kinetic energy, we need the rest mass. Let me think. The energy of the collider would be related to the kinetic energy of the ions.

Wait, the problem is asking for the energy of the RHIC. RHIC accelerates heavy ions, so each ion has a certain kinetic energy. But the total energy
