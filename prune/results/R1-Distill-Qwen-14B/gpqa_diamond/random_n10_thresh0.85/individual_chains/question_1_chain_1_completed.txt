Alright, so I've got this quantum mechanics question here. Hmm, okay, let me try to think through it. The question is about two quantum states with energies E1 and E2. Their lifetimes are given as 10^-9 seconds and 10^-8 seconds respectively. The goal is to find their energy difference so that they can be clearly resolved. The options are A to D.

Wait, I remember something about the uncertainty principle here. Oh right, the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle. It states that you can't simultaneously know both the energy and the lifetime of a particle with infinite precision. The product of the uncertainty in energy (ΔE) and the uncertainty in time (Δt) is at least ħ/2, where ħ is the reduced Planck's constant. So, ΔE * Δt ≈ ħ.

The formula I think is ΔE ≈ ħ / Δt. Since the lifetime here is the time uncertainty (Δt), this would give us the minimum energy uncertainty. If the energy difference between the two states is larger than this uncertainty, we can distinguish them.

Let me get the numbers straight. The lifetimes are 1e-9 and 1e-8 seconds. Wait, but which one's which? Oh, the question gives E1 and E2 with their respective lifetimes. But for the energy difference, I think we need to consider the uncertainty related to each state. Or perhaps, wait, maybe the energy difference should be greater than the sum of the uncertainties of each state? Or maybe each state contributes its own uncertainty, and the overall uncertainty is the sum?

Wait, perhaps I should think of the energy difference being detectable if it's larger than the uncertainty in energy for each state. So the energy difference ΔE should be greater than the uncertainty from each state. So I need to calculate the uncertainty for each and ensure that ΔE is larger than both.

Alternatively, perhaps the overall uncertainty when measuring the energy difference would be the sum of the uncertainties from each state. Hmm, I'm a bit confused here.

Let me think again. The Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle says that ΔE * Δt ≥ ħ/2. So, for each state, the uncertainty in energy is ħ/(2Δt). Let's compute that.

But wait, what's the value of ħ? Planck's constant h is approximately 6.626e-34 J·s. Since ħ is h/(2π), so ħ ≈ 1.055e-34 J·s.

Let me compute the uncertainty in energy for each state.

For the first state, lifetime Δt1 = 1e-9 s.

ΔE1 ≈ ħ / (2 * Δt1) = (1.055e-34) / (2 * 1e-9) = (1.055e-34) / 2e-9 = 5.275e-26 J.

Wait, but I need this in electron volts. Oh right, because the options are given in eV.

I remember that 1 eV is about 1.602e-19 J. So to convert from J to eV, I divide by 1.602e-19.

So, 5.275e-26 J divided by 1.602e-19 J/eV is approximately (5.275e-26)/(1.602e-19) = approx 3.29e-7 eV.

Wait that's 3.29e-7 eV. So for the first state, ΔE1 ≈ 3.3e-7 eV.

For the second state, Δt2 = 1e-8 s.

ΔE2 = ħ/(2Δt2) = (1.055e-34) / (2e-8) = (1.055e-34)/(2e-8) = 5.275e-27 J.

Convert to eV: 5.275e-27 / 1.602e-19 = approx 3.29e-8 eV.

So for each state, the energy uncertainty is about 3.3e-7 eV and 3.3e-8 eV, respectively.

Wait, but the question is about the energy difference between E1 and E2. To clearly distinguish them, the energy difference should be greater than the sum of their uncertainties? Or perhaps the maximum of the two?

Wait, no, maybe the total uncertainty in the energy difference would be the sum of the uncertainties of each state. Because when you're measuring the energy difference, you have to consider the uncertainty from each state's energy measurement.

So the maximum uncertainty in ΔE (E2 - E1) would be ΔE_total ≈ ΔE1 + ΔE2.

So that's 3.3e-7 eV + 3.3e-8 eV = approximately 3.63e-7 eV.

Wait, but wait. Another approach: the energy uncertainty for each state is ΔE1 and ΔE2. The energy difference has an uncertainty ΔΔE ≈ ΔE1 + ΔE2. So to resolve the two states, the actual energy difference must be larger than this combined uncertainty.

So the condition is |E2 - E1| > ΔE1 + ΔE2.

So let me compute ΔE1 + ΔE2.

We have ΔE1 = ~3.3e-7 eV, and ΔE2 = ~3.3e-8 eV. So their sum is about 3.63e-7 eV.

So the energy difference must be greater than 3.63e-7 eV to be clearly resolved.

Looking at the options:

A) 1e-9 eV → 0.001e-7 eV → much less than 3.6e-7, so no.

B) 1e-11 eV → way too small.

C) 1e-4 eV → 1e-4 is 1e3 times larger than 3.6e-7, so yes.

D) 1e-8 eV → 0.1e-7 eV, still less than 3.6e-7.

So the only option that's larger than 3.6e-7 eV is option C, 1e-4 eV. But wait, wait. Let me check the calculation again because 1e-4 is 10,000 times larger than 3.6e-7. So that's way more than needed, but it will definitely be resolvable. So option C would be correct.

Wait, but wait a second. I think I may have made a mistake in the calculations earlier. Let me recalculate the uncertainties more accurately.

Compute ħ/(2Δt) for each state.

Compute ħ in eV·s: We know that ħ is approximately 6.582e-16 eV·s. Because 1 eV is 1.602e-19 J, so Planck's constant in eV·s: h = 6.626e-34 J·s → ħ = h/(2π) ≈ 1.0545718e-34 J·s. Convert to eV·s: 1.0545718e-34 J·s / 1.602e-19 J/eV ≈ 6.582e-16 eV·s.

So ħ ≈ 6.582e-16 eV·s.

So the uncertainty in energy is ΔE ≈ ħ / (2Δt).

Wait, no: the uncertainty is roughly ΔE ≈ ħ / Δt. Because the Heisenberg principle is ΔE Δt ≥ ħ/2, so ΔE ≥ ħ/(2Δt). So perhaps it's better to use ΔE ≈ ħ/(2Δt) as an approximate value.

Wait for the first state, Δt is 1e-9 s. So ΔE1 ≈ (6.582e-16 eV·s) / (2 * 1e-9 s) ) → 6.582e-16 / 2e-9 = 3.291e-7 eV.

Similarly, the second state, Δt=1e-8 s: ΔE2=6.582e-16/(2e-8)= 6.582e-16/(2e-8)= 3.291e-8 eV.

So yeah, same as before. Summing them gives 3.62e-7 eV.

So the energy difference must be greater than approximately 3.62e-7 eV. So look at the options.

Option C is 1e-4 eV, which is 1e-4 = 0.0001 eV. 0.0001 eV is 1e-4 eV = 1e4 * 1e-8 eV. Wait, wait, no, 1e-4 is 100 times larger than 1e-6, which is 0.000001 eV. And 3.6e-7 is 0.00000036 eV. So 1e-4 is way bigger than that. So option C is 1e-4 eV, which is way larger than needed. So the energy difference would definitely be resolvable.

So the correct answer is C.

Wait, but looking at the options again, option D is 1e-8 eV, which is about the same as ΔE2, but smaller than the sum. So that's why it's not enough.

So the only option that's larger than 3.6e-7 eV is option C.


To determine the energy difference between two quantum states with energies \( E_1 \) and \( E_2 \), we use the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle, which states:

\[
\Delta E \cdot \Delta t \geq \frac{\hbar}{2},
\]

where \( \Delta E \) is the uncertainty in energy, \( \Delta t \) is the uncertainty in time (or lifetime), and \( \hbar \) is the reduced Planck's constant (\( \hbar \approx 6.582 \times 10^{-16} \, \text{eV·s} \)).

### Step 1: Calculate the energy uncertainty for each state
For the first state with lifetime \( \Delta t_1 = 10^{-9} \, \text{s} \):
\[
\Delta E_1 \approx \frac{\hbar}{2 \Delta t_1} = \frac{6.582 \times 10^{-16}}{2 \times 10^{-9}} = 3.291 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV}.
\]

For the second state with lifetime \( \Delta t_2 = 10^{-8} \, \text{s} \):
\[
\Delta E_2 \approx \frac{\hbar}{2 \Delta t_2} = \frac{6.582 \times 10^{-16}}{2 \times 10^{-8}} = 3.291 \times 10^{-8} \, \text{eV}.
\]

### Step 2: Combine the uncertainties
To resolve the two energy levels, the energy difference \( |E_2 - E_1| \) must be greater than the combined uncertainty:
\[
|E_2 - E_1| > \Delta E_1 + \Delta E_2.
\]
Substituting the values:
\[
\Delta E_1 + \Delta E_2 = 3.291 \times 10^{-7} + 3.291 \times 10^{-8} = 3.62 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV}.
\]

### Step 3: Analyze the options
- **Option A: \( 10^{-9} \, \text{eV} \)**  
  This is much smaller than \( 3.62 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \), so it is insufficient.

- **Option B: \( 10^{-11} \, \text{eV} \)**  
  This is also much smaller than \( 3.62 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \), so it is insufficient.

- **Option C: \( 10^{-4} \, \text{eV} \)**  
  This is \( 1 \, \text{eV} \times 10^{-4} = 0.0001 \, \text{eV} \), which is much larger than \( 3.62 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \). It is sufficient.

- **Option D: \( 10^{-8} \, \text{eV} \)**  
  This is smaller than \( 3.62 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \), so it is insufficient.

### Conclusion
The only energy difference that satisfies the condition \( |E_2 - E_1| > 3.62 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \) is \( 10^{-4} \, \text{eV} \).
