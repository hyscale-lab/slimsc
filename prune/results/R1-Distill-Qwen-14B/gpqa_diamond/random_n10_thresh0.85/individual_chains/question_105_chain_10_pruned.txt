Okay, so I'm trying to solve this astronomy problem here. Let's read through the question again and make sure I understand what's being asked.

The question is about a star that's similar to the Sun in radius. One hemisphere has dark spots covering 20% of its surface. The star's effective temperature is 6000 K, and the spots are 1000 K cooler. Because the star is rotating, these spots cause brightness variations as they come into and out of view. The problem says this situation can look like an exoplanet causing a dip in brightness when it transits the star.

The main question is asking: what should be the radius of an exoplanet (R_pl) relative to the star's radius (R_star) to produce the same brightness variation amplitude as the spots do? So, the options are A) ~0.39, B) ~0.07, C) ~0.11, D) ~0.32.

Hmm, okay. So I think the key here is to compare the brightness variation caused by the spots to that caused by a planet transit. The brightness dip from the planet would depend on the planet's size relative to the star, and the spots' dip would depend on their coverage and temperature difference.

Wait, but wait. Normally, when a planet transits a star, the brightness dip is (Rp / Rstar)^2. Because the area blocked is a circle with radius Rp, so the area is π Rp², and the star's area is π Rstar². So the fraction is (Rp/Rstar)^2.

But in this case, the star has spots. So when the spots are visible (on the hemisphere facing us), the brightness is lower because the spots are cooler. So the brightness variation would be the difference between when spots are visible and when they're not.

Wait, but the star is rotating, so the spots come into view as the star turns. Because it's one hemisphere, I think the spots would cover a certain fraction of the star's surface when viewed edge-on. But the problem has the filling factor as 20%. So the total area of spots is 20% of the hemisphere. Wait, but a hemisphere is half the star's surface, right? So if the filling factor is 20% of the hemisphere, then the total spotty area is 0.2 * (π Rstar² / 2) ?

Wait, no. Wait, the filling factor is the fraction of the surface covered by spots. So if the filling factor is 20%, then 20% of the entire star's surface is covered by spots. But the star is only showing one hemisphere at a time—so when it's rotating, the spots on the far side don't affect our view. Wait, no, because the star is a sphere, and when a spot is on the near side, it's visible, and when it's on the far side, it's not. So if the spots are only on one hemisphere, then when the star rotates, the spots come into view and then go away. So the maximum area of spots visible at any time is 20% of the star's surface.

Wait, no, the filling factor is 20%
