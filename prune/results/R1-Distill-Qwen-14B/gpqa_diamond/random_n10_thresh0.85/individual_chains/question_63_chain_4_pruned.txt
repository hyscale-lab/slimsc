Okay, so I have this physics problem in front of me, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The problem is about a diatomic molecule composed of elements X and Y. They've given me their masses, Mx is 20 amu and My is 2 amu. The bond length R is 2 angstroms, and the angular frequency of vibration w is 4e14 rad/s. The question is about the quantum rotation-vibration model, also known as the non-rigid rotor model. 

The molecule is in its fundamental state, and a photon is absorbed to switch to the next state with the lowest possible energy. I need to find the momentum of that photon. The options are given, so I should figure out which one is correct.

Hmm, okay. I remember that in quantum mechanics, molecules can be modeled as rigid rotors for rotational energy and harmonic oscillators for vibrational energy. But wait, this is the non-rigid rotor model, so maybe it's a bit more complicated. But for this problem, perhaps I can treat it as a combination of rotation and vibration.

Wait, but when a photon is absorbed, it's usually a transition between vibrational states, or rotational states, or both. But the question says the molecule is in the fundamental state. I think the fundamental state is the lowest energy state, which for a diatomic would be the ground vibrational state with the lowest rotational state. Or wait, maybe the fundamental state refers to the ground state of vibration, and the rotational state is also the lowest, which is J=0.

But the question is about switching to the next state with the lowest possible energy. Hmm, that probably suggests that the molecule transitions to the next higher state in either vibration or rotation, whichever requires the least energy. Because the photon's energy must match the energy gap between these states.

Wait, no, the problem specifies that the photon is absorbed, so the molecule goes to the next state. But what's the next state in terms of energy? The overall energy of the molecule is the sum of vibrational and rotational energies. So the next state could be either a higher vibrational state or a higher rotational state. But which transition requires less energy? Because the photon would have to match that energy difference.

So I
