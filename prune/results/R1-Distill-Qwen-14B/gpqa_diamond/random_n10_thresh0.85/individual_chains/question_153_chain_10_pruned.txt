Okay, so I've got this Michael addition problem to solve, and I'm a bit new to this, so I'll need to think it through step by step. Let's see what the question is all about.

The question presents three reactions (A, B, C) and gives the starting materials and reagents for each. I need to determine the major products and match them with the options provided.

First, let's recall what the Michael reaction is. If I remember correctly, the Michael reaction is a 1,4-addition (conjugate addition) of a nucleophile to an alpha-beta unsaturated carbonyl compound. The nucleophile (like an enolate) attacks the beta carbon, forming a new carbon-carbon bond.

Let me tackle each reaction one by one.

Reaction A:
Reactants: dimethyl malonate and methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate, with NaOEt and EtOH as reagents.

Wait, dimethyl malonate is a good source of the enolate. NaOEt in EtOH is a base, so it should deprotonate the malonate to form the enolate. The enolate will act as the nucleophile.

The other reactant is methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate. The structure of this is likely CH2=CH-C(O)OCH3, with the E configuration, but wait, actually, it's 3-(p-tolyl) substituent on the acrylate. So the structure is CH2-C(C6H4-p-tolyl)=CH-O-CO-OCH3? Wait, no. Wait, methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate would have the structure CH2=CH-C(O)OCH3, but with a p-tolyl group on the second carbon. Wait, acrylate is CH2=CHCOO-. So 3-(p-tolyl) would be on the third position? Hmm, maybe I should draw it.

Alternatively, perhaps it's (E)-methyl 3-(p-tolyl)acrylate, which would be CH2=CH-C(p-tolyl)O-CO-OEt? Wait, no. Let me think: acrylate is CH2=CHCOO-. So 3-(p-tolyl)acrylate would be CH2-CH(C6H4-p-tolyl)-COOEt. So the double bond is between C1 and C2, and the substituent is on C3. So the structure would be CH2-CH(C6H4-p-tolyl)-COOEt, but in (E) configuration, the substituents on either side of the double bond are opposite.

Wait, perhaps it's (E)-3-methyl acrylate, but with a p-tolyl group instead of methyl. Hmm, maybe I'm getting the structure wrong, but perhaps that's not critical right now. The key point is that it's an alpha-beta unsaturated carbonyl, so it's a Michael acceptor.

So, in the Michael reaction, the enolate of dimethyl malonate will attack the beta position (the second carbon) of the acrylate. Since the acceptor is E-configured, the attack will occur on the less substituted side, but I'm not entirely sure about that. Alternatively, the regiochemistry might be such that the major product forms the more stable enolate. 

The enolate from dimethyl malonate is a strong nucleophile. So, when the enolate attacks the beta carbon of the acrylate, it will form a new bond there, adding the malonate part to the acrylate.

So the product would have the structure where the malonate's R group (which is CH2- groups) adds to the acrylate. Let me think: the acrylate is CH2=CH-C-O-OEt, with the p-tolyl group on the CH2. Wait, no, the structure is (E)-methyl 3-(p-tolyl)acrylate, which is CH2=C(C6H4-p-tolyl)-COOEt. So the double bond is between C1 and C2, and the substitu
