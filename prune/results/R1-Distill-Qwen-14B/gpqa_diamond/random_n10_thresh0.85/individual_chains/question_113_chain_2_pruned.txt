Okay, I need to figure out the chemical formula of this unknown compound based on the given spectroscopic data. Let me go through each piece of information step by step.

First, looking at the FTIR spectrum. There's a very broad absorption around 3000 cm⁻¹. I remember that a broad peak in that region usually indicates O-H stretching, like in alcohols or maybe carboxylic acids. Wait, but if it's a carboxylic acid, the peak is usually even broader, but I'm not entirely sure. There's also a strong peak at 1700 and 1650 cm⁻¹. The 1700 area is typical for carbonyl groups, like ketones, aldehydes, or esters. The 1650 might be conjugated carbonyl, maybe an ester or a ketone with some conjugation. Alternatively, it could be an aromatic ring with a carbonyl group. Hmm, so maybe an ester or a ketone. 

Next, the 1H NMR shows peaks corresponding to vinyl hydrogens. Vinyl hydrogens are the ones on a double bond, like in alkenes. So the compound probably has an alkene group somewhere. Also, the presence of these protons would suggest that the structure isn't something that would eliminate those protons, like if there were a conjugated system or perhaps a substituent that deshields them. 

The mass spectrum has a fragment peak at m/z 45. I'm trying to think what fragments would give that. 45 could be a fragment like CH3COOH (though that's 60?), wait no. Maybe a CH2CH2O group? Or perhaps a propyl group. Wait, 45 is also the molecular ion for something like (maybe) (CH3)2CO, but wait, 45 is 45 g/mol. Let me calculate: 45 is C2H5O (2*12=24, 5*1=5, 16=16; total 45). No, wait, (CH3)2O would be 45? No, (CH3)2O is 2*12 + 6 + 16 = 30 + 16 = 46. Hmm. Wait another thought: 45 could be from a fragment like CH2=CH-O- something. Alternatively, maybe a ketone fragment. Alternatively, maybe an ethyl group attached to something else. Not sure yet.

So putting the pieces together. The compound has an O-H group (from the broad IR peak). It has a carbonyl group (from 1700 cm-1). And it has vinyl hydrogens (from NMR). Also, the molecular formula options are all C6H??O or O2. Let me consider each option.

Options are:
A) C6H12O2
B) C6H10O
C) C6H10O2
D) C6H12O

So, the formula possibilities are either 6 carbons, with varying hydrogens and oxygen.

If the compound has an O-H group (so at least one O), and a carbonyl group (another O), that would make sense for two oxygen atoms. So the formula would have O2, which leaves options A and C.

Wait, but option B and D only have one O. So if the IR shows a peak at 1700 and 1650, which are carbonyl peaks, and a broad O-H, then the compound likely has two oxygen atoms. So the formula is either A or C.

Now, the molecular formulas: A is C6H12O2, C is C6H10O2. So, two possibilities with O2.

Next, the NMR shows vinyl H, so the molecule has a double bond. So, maybe an ester with a double bond or a ketone with an alcohol and a double bond. Alternatively, maybe a conjugated system. 

Wait, the mass spec fragment at m/z 45. Let me think about possible structures. If the compound is something like a diol ester or something else with a carbonyl.

Wait, let's think about possible structures. If the compound has a carbonyl group, an O-H, and a double bond.

Option A is C6H12O2. The degree of unsaturation for C6H12O2 would be: (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. Assuming no X or N, it's (2*6 +2 -12 -0)/2 = (14-12)/2=2/2=1. So 1 degree of unsaturation. Which could be a ring or a double bond.

But wait, the NMR shows vinyl H, so that's a double bond. So perhaps a double bond plus a ring? Or just a double bond.

Wait, the degree of unsaturation for C6H12O2: (2*6 +2 -12 -0)/2 = (14-12)/2=1. So one double bond or one ring.

But wait, the NMR has vinyl H, so there's a double bond. So maybe it's a ring plus a double bond? Or maybe a single double bond. Hmm, but the NMR shows vinyl H, which implies a double bond.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is a cyclic ester, like a lactone, but not sure.

Option C is C6H10O2. The degree of unsaturation would be (2*6 +2 -10)/2 = (14-10)/2=2. So two degrees: could be two rings, a ring and a double bond, or two double bonds. But given that the NMR shows vinyl H, there's at least one double bond.

So, the structure has more unsaturation. Maybe an aromatic ring? Wait, but I don't have any information about aromatic protons in the NMR. The NMR only mentions vinyl H. So perhaps an alkene and a carbonyl group, but no benzene ring.

Wait, aromatic rings would show up in FTIR as C=C stretch, but the IR peaks are at 1700 and 1650. So maybe an aromatic ring with a conjugated carbonyl, like in a ketone or ester. But I'm not certain.

Hmm, let's think about the possible structures.

If the structure has an O-H, a carbonyl group, and a double bond, and it's C6H12O2, maybe it's a diol ester or a compound like methyl vinyl ether something.

Alternatively, perhaps a compound like ethyl acetoacetate, but that's more of a thought.

Wait, another approach: the molecular formula and the mass spectrum.

The molecular ion in mass spectrometry can give clues. The fragment at m/z 45 suggests a possible fragment. Let's think about possible fragments that give 45.

45 is 45 g/mol. Let me list possible structures. What's the molecular weight of 45?

45 could be C3H7O (since 3*12 +7 +16= 36+7+16=60? No. Wait, 3*12 is 36, 7 H is 7, O is 16. So 36+7+16=60? No, that's 59. Hmm, perhaps I'm getting this wrong.

Wait, 45 could be a fragment like (CH3)2CHO. Let's calculate: (CH3)2CHO is 4 carbons. Wait, (CH3)2CHO would be (2*12) + (6 +16) = 24 + 22=46. No. Hmm.

Alternatively, another approach. The molecular formula for the unknown compound is either C6H12O2 or C6H10O2. Let's compute their molecular weights.

C6H12O2: 6*12=72, 12*1=12, 2*16=32. Total=72+12+32=116 g/mol.

C6H10O2: 6*12=72, 10*1=10, 32. 72+10+32=114 g/mol.

So the molecular ions would be at m/z 116 (A) and 114 (C). But the question says the mass spectrum shows a fragment at 45, not the molecular ion. So perhaps the parent ion is higher, and the 45 is a fragment.

Looking for a possible fragment:

If the parent is C6H12O2 (116), then losing something would give 45. Let's see, 116 minus 45 is 71. What fragment would that be? Maybe an ethyl group (46) but that would leave 70, which doesn't match. Alternatively, perhaps a propyl group, but I'm not sure.

Wait, 45 could be a CH2CH2O group or something else. Alternatively, could it be a ketene group or an aldehyde group? Not sure.

Alternatively, maybe
