Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here, and I'm trying to wrap my head around it. Let me read it again.

The question says that in a specific region of the sky, the number of stars varies with parallax as 1 over plx to the fifth power. So, it's like N ∝ 1/plx^5. Hmm, and the question is about how the number of stars changes with distance, per unit range of distance r. The options are A to D, each with different exponents on r.

Wait, I remember that parallax is related to distance. Oh right! Parallax (plx) is inversely proportional to distance. Parallax is measured in arcseconds, and the formula is plx = 1/distance in parsecs. So if the distance (r) increases, parallax decreases.

So the question gives N ∝ 1/plx^5. But I need to relate this to r, the distance. Let me think: since plx is 1/r, then 1/plx would be r. So substituting plx with 1/r, the equation becomes N ∝ (r)^5. Oh, wait, no, wait. Let's see: 1/plx^5 is (1/(1/r))^5, which is (r)^5. So N is proportional to r^5.

Wait a second, no. Wait, let me clarify that. If plx = 1/r, then 1/plx is r. So 1/plx^5 is (r)^5. So N is proportional to r^5. So when distance increases, the number of stars increases as r^5.

But wait, the question is
