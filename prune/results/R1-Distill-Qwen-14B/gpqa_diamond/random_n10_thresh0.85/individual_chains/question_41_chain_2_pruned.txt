Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question again.

The question says that a light beam is propagating through a glass with index of refraction n. The glass is moving at a constant velocity v in the same direction as the beam and towards the observer in the laboratory. The question is asking for the speed of light in the glass relative to the observer in the laboratory. The options are given, and c is taken as 1.

Hmm, I remember that when dealing with light and motion, special relativity comes into play, especially since we're dealing with velocities and the speed of light. But wait, the glass is moving, and light is inside it. Normally, the speed of light in a medium with refractive index n is c/n, right? So in this case, the speed should be 1/n since c is 1.

But wait, the glass is moving. So the observer is in the lab frame, and the glass is moving at velocity v. How does that affect the speed of light as observed?

I think this is a case where you have to consider the velocity addition formula from special relativity. The formula for adding velocities when moving from one frame to another is not just a simple addition because of relativity. The formula is u' = (u + v) / (1 + (u*v)/(cÂ²)). But wait, I should make sure about the direction.

Wait, the glass is moving towards the observer, but the light is moving in the same direction as the glass. So in the glass's rest frame, the light
