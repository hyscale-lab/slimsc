Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit confused but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The problem is about an electron described by the state |alpha>, which is given as proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>. The |up> and |down> are eigenstates of the z-projection of the spin operator. So, I think this means they're the standard spin-up and spin-down states along the z-axis.

The question has two main parts: first, calculate the probability of measuring the particle in each eigenstate of another operator. The matrix representation of this operator has elements A_ij where A_ij is hbar/2 if i is not equal to j, and 0 otherwise. Second, find the average value of that operator.

Hmm, okay. Let's break it down. First, I need to normalize the state |alpha>, right? Because the problem says it's proportional, so we'll have to find the normalization constant.

The state is |alpha> = (1+i)|up> + (2 - i)|down>. To find the normalization, I need to compute the inner product <alpha|alpha> and make sure it equals 1. So, let's calculate that.

The inner product is (1-i)(2+i) for the cross terms, plus the squared magnitudes. Wait, no, wait. Let me think again. The inner product <alpha|alpha> is (1-i)*<up| + (2+i)*<down| multiplied by (1+i)|up> + (2 - i)|down>.

So, expanding this, it's (1-i)(1+i) * <up|up> + (1-i)(2-i) * <up|down> + (2+i)(1+i) * <down|up> + (2+i)(2 - i) * <down|down>.

But since |up> and |down> are orthonormal eigenstates, their inner products are zero except when they're the same. So the cross terms (like <up|down>) are zero. So the inner product reduces to the sum of the squares of the magnitudes of their coefficients.

So, calculating each term:

The first term is (1-i)(1+i) = (1)^2 - (i)^2 = 1 - (-1) = 2. Multiply by <up|up> which is 1. So 2*1=2.

The second term is (2+i)(2 - i) = (2)^2 - (i)^2 = 4 - (-1) = 5. Multiply by <down|down>=1, so 5.

So the total inner product is 2 + 5 =7. Therefore, the normalization constant is 1/sqrt(7). So the normalized |alpha> is (1+i)/sqrt(7) |up> + (2 - i)/sqrt(7) |down>.

Wait, wait, no. Wait, the original state is proportional, meaning it's multiplied by a constant. So the actual state would be |alpha> = [ (1+i)|up> + (2 - i)|down> ] multiplied by 1/sqrt(7), since the norm was 7.

So now, the state is normalized. So |alpha> = (1+i)/sqrt(7) |up> + (2 - i)/sqrt(7) |down>.

Now, the next part is about another operator with matrix elements A_ij. The matrix A is given such that A_ij = hbar/2 when i≠j, and 0 otherwise. Hmm, so what's the size of this matrix? Since the state is in a two-dimensional space (because it's a spin-1/2 system, so two states: up and down), the matrix is 2x2.

So, A is a 2x2 matrix where the diagonal elements are zero, and the off-diagonal elements are hbar/2. So the matrix looks like:

[ 0      hbar/2 ]
[ hbar/2  0     ]

Wait, no, wait. Wait, if i≠j, then A_ij is hbar/2. So for a 2x2 matrix, the positions (1,2) and (2,1) are
