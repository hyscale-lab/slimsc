Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. Hmm, let me try to figure it out. So the question is about selecting the right reagents for two reactions.

The first reaction is between butan-2-one and NaCN with something called A, right? The product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Wait, butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO, which is methylacetone. Adding NaCN and another reagent A gives this nitrile with a hydroxyl and methyl group on the same carbon.

I remember that when a ketone reacts with a cyanide, it's usually a nucleophilic addition. The cyanide ion acts as a nucleophile. But wait, in ketones, the carbonyl is a good electrophile. So the reaction would be something like: ketone + HCN or NaCN gives a cyanohydrin. Oh, right, a cyanohydrin is formed when a ketone adds HCN. The product has an alcohol and a nitrile group on the same carbon.

But wait, in this case, the reagent is NaCN. So maybe it's not just HCN. Wait, no, NaCN would provide CN- which is a strong nucleophile. So the reaction between ketone and NaCN in a protic solvent could produce the cyanohydrin. But the problem is, what's the role of reagent A here?

Wait, the reaction is butan-2-one + NaCN + A â†’ product. So A must be something that provides the H+ or protons. Because the cyanide would add as CN- and then the proton comes from somewhere. Oh, right, because the cyanide is a strong base. So in the presence of an acid, maybe?

Wait, but in the formation of cyanohydrins, usually, the ketone reacts with HCN, but if you use NaCN, perhaps you need an acidic condition to protonate the carbonyl oxygen and make it more electrophilic.

Alternatively, NaCN in an aqueous solution might not have enough acid, so adding H3O+ as a catalyst would make sense. So reagent A is H3O+ (which is option A or B), or maybe something else like NaHSO3 (which is a source of H+ and SO3^2-).

Wait, but NaHSO3 is sodium bisulfite. That's used in other reactions, like the reduction of ketones to alcohols, but I'm not sure in this context. So if A is H3O+, then the reaction would proceed under acidic conditions. So the first reaction uses H3O+ as A.

Then, moving to the second reaction. The starting material is 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile, and when treated with reagent B (in H2O), it becomes 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid. So the nitrile group (CN) is converted into a carboxylic acid (COOH).

What reagents are used to convert nitriles to carboxylic acids? I think hydrolysis is involved, and under certain conditions. For nitrile hydrolysis, you can use strong acids, like HCl, or strong bases, but more likely acidic conditions. Wait, the typical hydrolysis of nitriles to carboxylic acids is done under strong acidic conditions with heat.

Wait, but I've heard that nitriles can be hydrolyzed to carboxylic acids using a strong acid like HCl in H2O, perhaps with heat. Alternatively, sometimes it's done with H2O and H2SO4 as a catalyst. Or maybe using a peroxide and acid?

Wait, another thought: If the nitrile is treated with H2O and a strong acid, it could undergo hydrolysis. Alternatively, using something like KMn
