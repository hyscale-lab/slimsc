Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) and the energy required for a nucleus to move at 0.96c. Hmm, I remember that in relativity, when objects move at speeds close to the speed of light, their energy increases significantly due to relativistic effects. But I'm a bit rusty on the exact formulas, so I'll try to think it through.

The nucleus in question is Li with 3 neutrons. Wait, Li is lithium. Let me think, the standard lithium isotope is Li-7, which has 3 neutrons and 4 protons. So the nucleus is a Li-7 nucleus. But wait, the problem says it's Li with 3 neutrons, so yes, that's Li-7.

I think I need to calculate the total energy of the nucleus as it moves at 0.96c. The formula for relativistic energy is E = gamma * m * c². Gamma is the Lorentz factor, which depends on the velocity v.

So gamma is equal to 1 / sqrt(1 - (v²/c²)). Let me plug in v = 0.96c. So v squared is (0.96)^2 c², which is 0.9216 c². Subtracting that from c² gives 1 - 0.9216 = 0.0784. The square root of 0.0784 is 0.28, right? Because 0.28 squared is 0.0784. So gamma is 1/0.28 ≈ 3.5714.

Wait, that's about right because I remember that at 0.96c, gamma is around 3.57. Let me double-check that calculation. So 0.96 squared is 0.9216. 1 minus that is 0.0784. Square root is sqrt(0.0784) = 0.28. Yeah, that's correct. So gamma is 1/0.28 which is approximately 3.5714.

Next, I need the rest mass of the Li-7 nucleus. The nucleus consists of protons and neutrons. A proton is about 938 MeV/c², and a neutron is about 939 MeV/c², I think. So Li-7 has 4 protons and 3 neutrons. Let me add them up.

4 protons: 4
