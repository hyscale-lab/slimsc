Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here, and I need to figure out the right answer. Let me read it again and think through it step by step.

The question says that in a specific region of the sky, the number of stars varies with parallax as 1 over parallax to the fifth power, so 1/plx^5. And the question is asking how the number of stars changes with distance per unit range of distance r. The options are A to D, each representing a different power of r.

Hmm, I remember that parallax is related to distance. Parallax (plx) is the angle at which the position of a star appears to shift when viewed from different points in Earth's orbit. The formula I recall is that distance (d) in parsecs is approximately 1 divided by the parallax in arcseconds. So, d ≈ 1 / plx. But wait, that's the simple formula when parallax is in arcseconds and distance in parsecs. But here, the relationship given is N ∝ 1/plx^5.

Wait, but the question is about how the number of stars changes with distance. So I need to relate plx to distance and then see how N depends on r, the distance.

Let me think: since d ≈ 1/plx, that means plx is approximately 1/d. So plx ≈ 1/d. But wait, maybe I should be more precise. The exact relation is plx (in arcseconds) = 1 / d (in parsecs). So plx = 1/d. So if I have N varying with 1/plx^5, substituting plx with 1/d, then N ∝ 1/( (1/d) )^5. Let me compute that.

1/( (1/d)^5 ) equals d^5. So N ∝ d^5. So the number of stars is proportional to the fifth power of the distance. Wait, but the question is about how the number changes per unit range of distance. Oh, wait, perhaps I need to find the number of stars per unit distance, not the cumulative number up to a certain distance.

Wait, let me clarify. The question says, "how does the number of stars ... change with distance (per unit range of distance, r)?" So it's the number per unit distance, like the density or something. Hmm.

Wait, maybe I got it wrong. Let's think about it again. The original statement is that N (number of stars) varies as 1/plx^5. So N ∝ 1/plx^5. Since plx is 1/d, substituting gives N ∝ d^5. So as distance increases, the number of stars increases with the fifth power. But that's the total number up to distance d. But the question is about the number per unit distance.

Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of differential. Let's say N is the number of stars at a certain distance. Or more accurately, the number of stars between distance r and r + dr is proportional to something. So the number density as a function of distance would be the derivative of N with respect to r.

Wait, maybe I should model this as a function of distance. Let me imagine that the number of stars within a certain distance d is given by N(d) = k * d^5, where k is a constant. But wait, that can't be right because the number of stars within a certain distance should increase with the volume, which goes as d^3. But this seems different.

Wait, maybe I'm getting
