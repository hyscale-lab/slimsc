Okay, so I need to figure out which planet has a higher probability of transiting. Both planets are Earth-like, so I'm assuming they have similar sizes, but maybe the difference in their host stars will matter.

So, the question gives me some information. Let me list it out:

- Both planets have the same mass. So their actual masses are equal. But that might not directly affect the transit probability.

- Planet_1 has an orbital period three times shorter than Planet_2. So Planet_1 is much closer to its star. Because orbital period is related to the distance from the star. Shorter period means it's closer in.

- Both have circular orbits, so no eccentricity to worry about. That simplifies things a bit.

- The host stars: Planet_1's star has twice the mass of Planet_2's star. But both stars have the same radius. Oh, interesting. So even though Planet_1's star is more massive, it's not larger in radius. So maybe it's a main-sequence star, while Planet_2's star is slightly evolved but same size. Hmm.

Wait, I'm a bit confused. If a star is more massive, it's usually larger, but here both have the same radius. So maybe Planet_1's star is more massive but just as big as Planet_2's. That's a bit unusual, but okay.

Transit probability depends on the alignment of the planet's orbit with our line of sight and the size of the planet compared to the star. But since both are Earth-like, their sizes are comparable. So the main factors are the orbital distance and the star's size.

Wait, the transit probability is higher when the orbital plane is edge-on to us. But the probability also depends on the planet's orbital distance because the chance of the orbit being aligned right increases with the planet's distance from the starâ€”no, wait, that's not right. I think the probability is a product of the planet's orbital size and the star's size.

Wait, no, the transit probability isn't directly about the distance, but more about the relative sizes. Let me think. The probability of a transit is roughly the ratio of the planet's orbital distance (in the sky) relative to the star's size. Wait, no, transit probability is the chance that the planet's orbital plane crosses our line of sight, which is more of an inclination issue. But I remember that the probability is given by R_star / a, where R_star is the star's radius and a
