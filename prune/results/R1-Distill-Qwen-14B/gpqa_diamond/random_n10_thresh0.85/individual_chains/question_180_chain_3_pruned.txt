Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I need to figure out the minimum energy of this system. Let me read through what's given.

Alright, the setup is an isolated system with 13 identical particles. Each has a charge of 2e, and their mass is negligible. Twelve of these charges are constrained to stay at a distance of 2 meters from a point P. The 13th charge is fixed at P. And I need to find the minimum energy of this system.

Hmm, okay. So the system is made up of charges, so this must be an electrostatics problem involving potential energy. Since it's an isolated system, I think the potential energy would be the electric potential energy between all the charges.

I remember that the potential energy between two point charges is given by Coulomb's law formula: U = k * (q1 * q2) / r. But wait, when you have multiple charges, you have to consider all the pairwise interactions, right? So the total potential energy is the sum of the potential energies of each pair.

But wait, in this case, the 13th charge is fixed at point P, and the other 12 are each 2 meters away from P. So all the 12 are at the same distance from P. So each of those 12 is at distance 2 m from P. But what about the distance between the 12 charges? Are they all at the same point 2 m away, or are they arranged around P? The problem says they are constrained to stay at 2 m from P, but their exact arrangement among themselves isn't specified. Hmm, this could complicate things because the distances between the 12 charges might affect the potential energy. But since the problem says it's the minimum energy, maybe I can arrange the charges in a way that minimizes the total potential energy.

Wait, but wait. Because the charges are all identical and positive (since each is 2e, and e is positive), they would naturally repel each other. So to minimize potential energy, they should be as far apart as possible. But in this setup, since they're constrained to 2 m from point P, perhaps they are all on the surface of a sphere with
