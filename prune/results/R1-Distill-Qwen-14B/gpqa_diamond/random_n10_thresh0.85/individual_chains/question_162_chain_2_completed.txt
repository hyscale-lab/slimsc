Alright, so I've got this question about a metric and finding the area of a pseudosphere. Hmm, I'm not super familiar with pseudospheres, but I remember they have something to do with hyperbolic geometry. Let me think.

The metric given is ds² = (32)/(4 - x² - y²) (dx² + dy²). Wait, okay, that looks like a line element in two dimensions. I think I remember that in general relativity, or differential geometry, the metric tensor describes the geometry of the space. So this must be a two-dimensional metric.

Pseudosphere... Oh right, a pseudosphere is a surface of constant negative curvature. But wait, I thought pseudospheres are a type of tractricoid, which are the surfaces of revolution of a tractrix. But the question here is about the area.

Wait, the question is asking for the area of the pseudosphere of radius r=2. Wait, but pseudospheres have infinite area because they're like hyperbolic surfaces that extend infinitely. Or is that not right? No, wait, no—pseudospheres, like the tractricoid, are finite in extent. Hmm, I'm a bit confused now.

Wait, maybe the metric given here is that of a pseudosphere. Let's see. The metric is in terms of x and y, so it's a 2D metric. Let me see if it's similar to any standard metrics I know.

Wait, another approach: the area can be found using the metric. In two dimensions, the area element dA is sqrt(g) dx dy, where g is the determinant of the metric tensor. So let's compute that.

The given metric is diagonal, I think. Because it's (something) dx² + (something) dy². So the metric tensor components are g_xx = 32/(4 - x² - y²), and g_yy is the same. The off-diagonal terms (g_xy and g_yx) are zero. So the determinant g is g_xx * g_yy since it's diagonal. So g = [32/(4 - x² - y²)]².

So the area element dA is sqrt(g) dx dy, right? Wait, no: the area element is sqrt(det g) dx dy. Since g is diagonal, and each component is 32/(4 - r²), where r² = x² + y². So det g is (32/(4 - r²))². The square root of that is 32/(4 - r²).

Wait, wait, sqrt(g) would be sqrt( (32/(4 - r²))^2 ) which is 32/(4 - r²), because 4 - r² is positive, I think, because 4 is the denominator. Wait, but wait, the denominator is (4 - x² - y²). So 4 - x² - y² must be positive because otherwise the metric would be singular, so x² + y² < 4. So the region is a disk of radius 2 in the x-y plane. Because 4 is 2 squared.

So the area is the integral over x and y of dA, which is [32/(4 - r²)] dx dy. But since r² = x² + y², it's easier to switch to polar coordinates. So r² = r², x² + y² = r², and dx dy becomes r dr dθ.

So the area integral becomes ∫ (from r=0 to r=2) ∫ (θ=0 to 2π) [32/(4 - r²)] * r dr dθ.

Wait, yeah. So let me compute that. Let's factor out the constants.

The area A = ∫(θ=0 to 2π) dθ ∫(r=0 to 2) [32 r / (4 - r²)] dr.

First, the θ integral: ∫0 to 2π dθ is 2π.

So A = 2π * ∫0^2 [32 r / (4 - r²)] dr.

Let me make a substitution for the integral. Let u = 4 - r². Then du/dr = -2r, so -du/2 = r dr.

When r=0, u=4. When r=2, u=4 - (2)^2 = 0.

So the integral becomes ∫ from u=4 to u=0 of (32 / u) * (-du/2).

Wait, because when r=0, u=4, and when r=2, u=0. So the limits will invert when substituting. Let me write it out:

∫ from r=0 to r=2 of [32 r / (4 - r²)] dr = 32 ∫ [r dr]/(4 - r^2)

= 32 * [ (-1/2) ∫ du/u ] from u=4 to u=0.

So, 32 * (-1/2) [ ln(u) ] from 4 to 0.

Wait, but integrating from 4 to 0 with substitution u=4 - r². So when r increases, u decreases.

So the integral becomes 32 * (1/2) ∫ from u=0 to u=4 of (du)/(u) * (-1), because when r increases, u decreases. Hmm, maybe I should handle the substitution more carefully.

Wait, let me redo the substitution. Let u =4 - r². Then du = -2r dr → r dr = -du/2.

So when r=0, u=4.

When r=2, u=0.

So the integral becomes ∫ from u=4 to u=0 of [32 * (-du/2)] / u.

Which is (32 * (-1/2)) ∫ from 4 to 0 (1/u) du.

Which is (-16) [ ∫ from 4 to 0 (1/u) du ].

But ∫ from 4 to 0 is the same as -∫ from 0 to4. So:

-16 * [ - ∫ from 0 to4 (1/u) du ] → 16 ∫ from 0 to4 (1/u) du.

Wait, but ∫ (1/u) du from 0 to4 is divergent because ln(0) is negative infinity. So the integral becomes 16 ( ln(4) - ln(0) ), but ln(0) is -infinity, so ln(4) - (-infty) is +infty. So the integral diverges to infinity.

Wait, that's a problem. So the area would be infinite. But that's not possible, because a pseudosphere has finite area, right? Or is this a different case?

Wait, wait. The metric given is ds² = [32/(4 - x² - y²)] (dx² + dy²). Let me think about the coordinates. So x² + y² <4, so the domain is a disk of radius 2. But in terms of the geometry, the area element is [32/(4 - r²)] * r dr dθ.

Wait, when r approaches 2, the denominator approaches zero, so the area element blows up. That suggests that as you approach the edge of the disk (r=2), the area near that boundary becomes infinite. So the total area would be infinite. But that can't be right because a pseudosphere should have finite area.

Hmm, perhaps I'm confusing different models. There are different models for hyperbolic geometry. The Poincaré disk model and the tractricoid (pseudosphere) are two different models.

Wait, the metric given here looks like the Poincaré disk model. The standard Poincaré disk metric is ds² = [4/(1 + x² + y²)]² (dx² + dy²), but this is different. Hmm. Let me think again.

Wait, the standard Poincaré disk has a metric where the denominator is (1 - r²)^2, but perhaps scaled. Alternatively, maybe the metric given is similar but with a different scaling.

Wait, but regardless, the calculation I did suggests the area is infinite. Because the integral from 0 to 2 of [32 r/(4 - r²)] dr is divergent, right?

Wait, let's compute the integral ∫ [32 r]/(4 - r²) dr from 0 to 2.

Let me compute without substitution. Let me see:

Let me write it as 32 ∫ [r dr]/(4 - r²).

Let me make the substitution u=4 - r² → du= -2 r dr → r dr = -du/2.

So the integral becomes 32 * ∫ [ (-du/2) ] / u = -16 ∫ (1/u) du.

Which is -16 ln|u| + C.

So evaluating from r=0 (u=4) to r=2 (u=0):

At u=0, ln(0) is negative infinity. So the integral is -16 [ ln(0) - ln(4) ) ] → -16 [ (-infty) - ln(4) ] → -16 ( -infty ) → +infty.

So the integral is divergent, leading to infinite area.

But how does that make sense? Because a pseudosphere is supposed to have finite area. Wait, but perhaps this is not the metric of a pseudosphere. Or perhaps I'm miscalculating.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the given metric is that of a sphere, not a pseudosphere. Let me think—wait, spheres have positive curvature, pseudospheres have negative.

Wait, no, the question is about a pseudosphere, so I must be missing something. Alternatively, maybe the given metric is that of a sphere with radius 2, but that would have finite area. Or perhaps the metric is singular at r=2, leading to infinite area.

Wait, the area as computed is infinite, so maybe the correct answer is D) +infty.

Looking at the options:

A) 0 → No, that's not possible.

B) 4π(x² + y²) → That doesn't make sense, because area shouldn't depend on x and y.

C) 4π(x² - y²) → Same issue as B.

D) +infty → Yes, because the integral diverges, so the area is infinite.

So the answer must be D.


The given metric is 

\[
ds^2 = \frac{32}{4 - x^2 - y^2} \left(dx^2 + dy^2\right),
\]

which describes a two-dimensional space. To find the area of the pseudosphere of radius \(r = 2\), we compute the area element \(dA\) using the determinant of the metric tensor. Since the metric is diagonal, the determinant is 

\[
g = \left(\frac{32}{4 - x^2 - y^2}\right)^2,
\]

and the area element becomes 

\[
dA = \sqrt{g} \, dx \, dy = \frac{32}{4 - x^2 - y^2} \, dx \, dy.
\]

Switching to polar coordinates (\(x^2 + y^2 = r^2\)), the area element becomes 

\[
dA = \frac{32}{4 - r^2} \cdot r \, dr \, d\theta.
\]

The total area is then given by the integral:

\[
A = \int_0^{2\pi} d\theta \int_0^2 \frac{32 \, r}{4 - r^2} \, dr.
\]

First, compute the angular integral:

\[
\int_0^{2\pi} d\theta = 2\pi.
\]

Next, compute the radial integral:

\[
\int_0^2 \frac{32 \, r}{4 - r^2} \, dr.
\]

Using the substitution \(u = 4 - r^2\), \(du = -2r \, dr\), the integral becomes:

\[
\int_4^0 \frac{-32}{2u} \, du = 16 \int_0^4 \frac{1}{u} \, du.
\]

The integral \(\int_0^4 \frac{1}{u} \, du\) diverges because \(\ln(0)\) is \(-\infty\). Therefore, the total area is infinite.

Given the options:

- **A) 0**: Incorrect, as the area cannot be zero.
- **B) \(4\pi(x^2 + y^2)\)**: Incorrect, as the area should not depend on \(x\) and \(y\).
- **C) \(4\pi(x^2 - y^2)\)**: Incorrect, as the area should not depend on \(x\) and \(y\).
- **D) \(+\infty\)**: Correct, as the integral diverges, leading to an infinite area.

The area of the pseudosphere in this metric is infinite.

Answer: D
