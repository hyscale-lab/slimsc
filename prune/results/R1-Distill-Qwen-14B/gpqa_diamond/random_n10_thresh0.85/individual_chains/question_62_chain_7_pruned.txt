Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem to solve. It's about synthesizing a specific compound from ethynylcyclohexane using the right sequence of reagents. I'm a bit rusty on my reactions, but I'll try to think it through step by step.

The target molecule is 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. Hmm, let's break that down. The main structure seems to have a cyclohexane ring with a substituent. The substituent is (cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl), which means a methyl group attached to a cyclohexane ring, which itself has a hydroxyl group. Also, there's a carbonyl group (aldehyde) attached somewhere.

The starting material is ethynylcyclohexane, which is cyclohexane with an ethynyl group (a triple bond, so maybe a vinyl group?). Wait, ethynyl is triple bond between two carbons, right? So ethynylcyclohexane would have a structure like cyclohexane-CH₂-C≡CH? Or is it cyclohexane attached to a carbon that's part of a triple bond? Wait, ethynyl is the substituent, so it's more likely CH₂C≡CH attached to the cyclohexane. Wait, no, ethynyl is -C≡CH, so ethynylcyclohexane would be cyclohexane with a -C≡CH group attached. So, structure is cyclohexane-CH₂-C≡CH? Or is it cyclohexane directly attached to the triple bond? Like cyclohexane-C≡CH? Hmm, maybe it's cyclohexane with a triple bond to another carbon, so maybe cyclohexylacetylene: cyclohexane attached to a triple bond, so the structure would be CH₂CH₂... cyclohexane ring connected to a CH₂-C≡CH group? Wait, maybe I should draw it. But since I can't, I'll just think.

The target is a cyclohexanecarbaldehyde, meaning there's an aldehyde group attached to the cyclohexane. Also, the substituent is a cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl group. So the cyclohexane ring has a methyl group, which is attached to another cyclohexane ring (cyclohexyl), and a hydroxyl
