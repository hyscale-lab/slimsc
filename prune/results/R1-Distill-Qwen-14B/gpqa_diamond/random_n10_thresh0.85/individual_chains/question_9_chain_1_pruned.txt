Okay, so I've got this chemistry question here about which molecule has C3h symmetry. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my symmetry concepts, but I'll try to think it through.

First, I need to remember what C3h symmetry means. C3h is one of the point groups in molecular symmetry. The point groups are used to classify molecules based on their symmetry elements. C3h has a combination of a three-fold rotation axis (C3) and a horizontal mirror plane (σh). Or wait, is it a horizontal mirror plane that includes the C3 axis? I think C3h includes a C3 axis and a σh mirror plane perpendicular to it, maybe.

Alternatively, sometimes C3h is considered to have a C3 axis and a horizontal mirror plane that's perpendicular to the main axis. Oh wait, no, the h in C3h refers to the horizontal mirror plane. So the molecule would have a three-fold rotation axis, and a mirror plane that's horizontal, meaning it's perpendicular to the main axis.

Alternatively, I might be confusing with D3h. D3h has multiple symmetry elements, including a C3 axis, a σh plane, and others like C2 axes. But C3h would be a lower symmetry group. So a molecule with C3h symmetry would have a three-fold rotation and a horizontal mirror.

Now, looking at the options, I need to figure out which of these molecules has that symmetry.

The options are:

A) triphenyleno[1,2-c:5,6-c':9,10-c'']trifuran-1,3,6,8,11,13-hexaone
B) benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran-1,3,4,6,7,9-hexaone
C) triisopropyl borate
D) quinuclidine

I'll go through each one.

Option C: triisopropyl borate. Triisopropyl borate has the formula (i-Pr)3BO. Its structure is a central boron atom with three isopropyl groups attached. Isopropyl groups are symmetric, but the molecule might have a certain symmetry. Let me think, each isopropyl is connected in a trigonal planar arrangement around boron. Wait, no, the structure is more like a trigonal planar, but each isopropyl is a tertiary group. So the molecule might have a three-fold axis. If all three substituents are the same, then it might have C3 symmetry. But does it have a mirror plane?

Wait, triisopropyl borate is similar to trimethyl borate, but with isopropyl groups. Trimethyl borate is symmetric. Each methyl is attached to B, which is trigonal planar. So it's symmetric through the C3 axis, but does it have a horizontal mirror plane?

Wait, maybe triisopropyl borate has a three-fold rotation axis (C3) because all three groups are identical, but does it have a mirror
