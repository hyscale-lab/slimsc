Alright, so I've got this astronomy question here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again.

The question says that in a specific region of the sky, the number of stars varies with parallax as 1 divided by parallax to the fifth power. So, the formula is N ∝ 1/plx^5. And the question is asking how the number of stars changes with distance, per unit range of distance r. The options are A to D, each with different exponents.

Hmm. Okay, I remember that parallax is related to distance. Parallax is defined as plx = 1/d, where d is the distance in parsecs. Wait, no, more accurately, plx (in arcseconds) is equal to 1 divided by the distance (d) in parsecs. So d = 1/plx. That's the basic relationship between parallax and distance.

So the number of stars, N, is proportional to 1/plx^5. Let's write that down: N ∝ 1/(plx)^5.

Since plx is 1/d, substituting that in gives N ∝ 1/( (1/d) )^5. Simplifying that, 1/(1/d)^5 is the same as d^5. So N ∝ d^5. Wait, does that mean that the number of stars is proportional to the distance to the fifth power?

But wait, the question is about how the number of stars changes with distance, per unit range of distance r. Oh, so it's about the change in number with respect to distance, like the derivative perhaps?

Wait, let me think. If N is proportional to d^5, then the number of stars increases rapidly with distance. But the question is asking about the change per unit distance. So maybe they want to know how N changes as r increases, like the differential relationship.

Alternatively, maybe it's about the number of stars in a shell at distance r. Because if you imagine looking at a thin shell at a certain distance, the number of stars in that shell would depend on the volume of that shell, which itself depends on r squared times an area (like 4πr²) times the thickness (dr), but perhaps that's complicating things.

Wait, no, let me get back. The initial relation is N ∝ 1/(plx)^5. Since plx = 1/d, substituting that in gives N ∝ d^5. So the number of stars depends directly on the fifth power of distance.

Wait, but that doesn't seem right. Because as
