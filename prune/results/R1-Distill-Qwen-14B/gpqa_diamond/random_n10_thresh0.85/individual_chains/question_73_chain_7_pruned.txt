Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds. Hmm, I remember that when dealing with velocities close to the speed of light, we can't just use classical mechanics because relativity comes into play. Oh right, Einstein's theory of relativity changes how we calculate velocities and energies.

The problem states that the two astronauts have masses 2m and 3m, moving at 0.6c and 0.5c respectively in the positive x-direction. The question is asking for two things: the relative speed between them and the total energy of the system.

Wait, I'm a bit confused. Because in relativity, velocities don't just add up linearly. So if I want to find the relative speed of one astronaut from the perspective of the other, I can't just subtract the speeds. I'll need to use the velocity addition formula.

The velocity addition formula is (u - v)/(1 - (uv/c²)), right? Wait, no. Wait, actually, I think the formula is (u' = (u - v) / (1 - (u v)/(c²)) ). Because if one frame is moving at v relative to another, then the velocity u of an object in the first frame as seen from the second is u'.

So, let's say astronaut A is moving at 0.6c, and astronaut B at 0.5c, both in the same direction. So from A's perspective, what is B's speed? Or wait, the problem is about their relative speed. So astronaut A is in one frame, and B is moving with velocity 0.5c in the same direction. So from A's frame, B's speed would be (0.5c - 0.6c) divided by (1 - (0.5c * 0.6c)/(c²)). Wait, let me compute that.

Wait, no. Actually, astronaut A is moving at 0.6c relative to the ground. Astronaut B is moving at 0.5c relative to the ground. So from A's perspective, B's velocity is (0.5c - 0.6c) divided by (1 - (0.5c * 0.6c)/(c²)). Let me calculate the numerator and denominator.

Numerator: 0.5c - 0.6c = -0.1c. So the speed would be negative, but since speed is magnitude, maybe it's 0.1c. But wait, the options have positive relative speeds, so I think the question is about the magnitude.

But I should check the calculation. Let me compute the denominator: 1 - (0.5c * 0.6c)/(c^2) = 1 - (0.3 c²)/(c²) = 1 - 0.3 = 0.7.

So the relative speed would be (-0.1c) / 0.7 = approximately -0.1428c. The negative indicates direction, but since the question asks for speed, the magnitude is 0.1428c, which is about 0.14c. So that looks like one of the options, perhaps.

Wait, looking at the options, option C and D have v_rel as 0.14c. So that's one part.

Now for the total energy of the system. Each astronaut's energy includes their relativistic kinetic energy plus rest mass energy. Oh wait, wait. No, the total energy is the sum of their relativistic energies. So each one's energy is gamma * m c². So for astronaut 1 (mass 2m, speed 0.6c), gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - (0.6)^2) = 1/sqrt(1 - 0.36) = 1/sqrt(0.64) = 1/0.8 = 1.25. So their energy is 1.25 * 2m c² = 2.5 m c².

Astronaut 2 (mass 3m, speed 0.5c), gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - 0.25) =1/sqrt(0.75) ≈ 1.1547. So their energy is 1.1547 * 3m c² ≈ 3.464 m c².

Adding the two, 2.5 + 3.464 is approximately 5.964 m c². So looking at the options, option C says E=5.96 mc². Option B says 4.96, which is lower. So the correct energy is about 5.96.

So putting it together, the relative speed is 0.14c, and the energy is about 5.96 mc². Looking at the options, option C is v_rel=0.14c, E=5.96 mc². Option D has E=5 mc², which is too low.

Wait, but wait. Let me double-check the velocity addition. Oh wait, no. I think I made a mistake earlier. Because the velocity u' is (u - v
