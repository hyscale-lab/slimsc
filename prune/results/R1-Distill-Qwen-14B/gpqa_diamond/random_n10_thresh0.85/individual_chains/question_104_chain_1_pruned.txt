Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here about exoplanets and the radial velocity method. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through.

The question says that two stars with the same mass as the Sun have each been found to have a planet, both similar to Neptune in mass. Both planets are in circular orbits. The detection is done using the radial velocity (RV) method.

The RV method measures the Doppler shift in the star's spectrum caused by the planet's gravitational pull. The shift relates to the velocity of the star moving due to the planet. So the bigger the shift, the more massive the planet? Wait, no, wait. Wait, the shift also depends on the orbital period and the mass of the planet, I think.

Wait, the problem gives the wavelength shift for each planet. Planet #1 has a shift of 5 milliangstroms, and Planet #2 has 7. The question is about the ratio of their orbital periods—specifically, how many times longer is Planet #2's period compared to Planet #1's.

I remember that the RV method's measured velocity (v) is related to the planet's mass and the orbital period. The formula for this is something like v = ( (G * (M_p) ) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(1/3) ) ) ) * (1 / (P * (1 - e²)^(1/2))) ) ), but wait, maybe I'm mixing some formulas here. Alternatively, I think the radial velocity semi-amplitude K is given by the formula:

K = [ (G * (M_p) ) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(1/3) ) )^(1/1) ) ] * (1 / ( (P * (1 - e²))^(1/2) ) )

Wait, but since M_p (planet mass) is much smaller than M_star (which is solar mass), M_star + M_p ≈ M_star. So maybe it can be approximated as K ≈ ( (G * M_p ) / ( M_star^(2/3) ) )^(1/1) ) * (1 / ( (P * sqrt(1-e²) )) )

Wait, but since both planets are similar to Neptune, which is much less massive than the Sun, we can ignore M_p compared to M_star. So M_p is negligible, so M_star + M_p ≈ M_star.

So the simplified formula for K (the semi-amplitude of radial velocity) is K = [ (G * M_p
