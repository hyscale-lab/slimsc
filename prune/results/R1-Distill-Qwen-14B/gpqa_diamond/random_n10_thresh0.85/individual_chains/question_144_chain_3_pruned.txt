Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The problem says that X is a meson resonance. We need to find the mean decay distance. The given data includes the production energy E_X = 8 GeV, the mass m_X = 1.2 GeV, and the width Γ_X = 320 MeV. The options are A to D with different values in meters.

Hmm, wait, I'm a bit rusty on meson decay. I remember that the mean decay length depends on how long the particle lives before decaying. The longer it lives, the further it can travel before decaying. So the mean decay distance is related to the lifetime of the particle multiplied by its velocity.

Right, the formula I recall is: mean decay distance L = γ * β * c * τ, where γ is the Lorentz factor, β is the velocity over the speed of light, c is the speed of light, and τ is the proper lifetime.

But how do I find τ? Oh, right, the width Γ is related to the lifetime. The uncertainty principle tells us that Γ ≈ ħ/τ, so τ ≈ ħ/Γ. But wait, Γ is given in MeV, and I need units that work out. Let me think about the units.

Planck's constant ħ is approximately 6.582 × 10^-25 GeV·s. Oh wait, because 1 GeV is 1e9 eV, and 1 eV is 1.6e-19 J, but maybe I can just use ħ ≈ 6.582e-25 GeV·s.

So, if Γ is given in GeV, then τ = ħ / Γ (in GeV). But wait, Γ is 320 MeV, which is 0.32 GeV. So τ ≈ (6.582e-25 GeV·s) / 0.32 GeV = approximately 2.056e-24 seconds. Wait, no wait, 6.582e-25 divided by 0.32 is around 2.056e-24. Hmm, maybe I'll compute that exactly later.

Next, I need to calculate the Lorentz factor γ. Since E_X is given as 8 GeV, and the mass is 1.2 GeV, I can find the total energy. The total energy E is γ m c². So, E = γ m c² => γ = E / (m c²). But since E and m are both in GeV, but c^2 is in terms of energy per mass. Wait, maybe I can just compute γ as E_X / m_X. Because E_X is the total energy, which is γ m c². So in units where c=1 (as in particle physics), E_X = γ m_X, so γ = E_X / m_X. So here, E_X is 8 GeV, m_X is 1.2 GeV. So γ = 8 / 1.2 = 6.666... approximately 6.6667.

Wait, but wait a second. Sometimes when particles are produced with a certain energy, that's the kinetic energy, not the total energy.
