Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem in front of me, and I'm a bit nervous because these reaction mechanisms can get tricky. Let me try to break it down step by step.

The question says that Compound X reacts with red phosphorus and HI. I remember that red phosphorus is often used in the Clemmensen reduction, which reduces ketones or aldehydes to alkanes. But wait, Clemmensen uses HCl and red phosphorus, right? Oh, but wait, sometimes it's also used for other reductions, maybe even for other carbonyl groups. Alternatively, I've heard that red phosphorus can be involved in other types of reactions, but Clemmensen is the main one I remember. So if that's the case, I should look for a carbonyl group in Compound X because that would be the starting point for such a reaction.

Looking at the IR data: The peaks mentioned are 3400â€“2500 cm-1, which usually indicates O-H stretching (like in an acid) or perhaps N-H, but the other peaks are at 1720, 1610, and 1450 cm-1. The 1720 is a strong peak, which is typical for a carbonyl group like a ketone, aldehyde, or maybe an ester. The 1610 and 1450 might be aromatic C=C stretching. So this suggests that Compound X has a carbonyl group and an aromatic ring.

The 1H NMR data: Let's parse that. 

- 10.5 ppm (bs, 1H): That's a broad singlet, which could be an O-H proton, like from a carboxylic acid. Alternatively, maybe an aldehyde proton, but that's usually around 9-10 ppm as a singlet. But wait, a carboxylic acid proton is broad because it's easily exchanged and appears around 10-12 ppm. So this might suggest a COOH group.
- 8.0 ppm (d, 2H): Aromatic protons, probably para-substituted because it's a doublet. So maybe a benzene ring with substituents in the para positions.
- 7.2 ppm (d, 2H): Also aromatic, another doublet. So the two doublets together suggest a para-substituted benzene, perhaps with two substituents in the para positions.
- Then we have 2.9 ppm (m, 1H): Maybe a methylene or methine group attached to something, perhaps adjacent to an electronegative atom like oxygen or part of a CH2 group next to a carbonyl.
- 1.7 ppm (m, 2H): Maybe more CH2 groups, perhaps part of a chain attached to the ring.
- 1.4 ppm (d, 3H): A triplet or doublet? Wait, no, this is specified as a doublet. Wait, no, it's a 'd' for doublet. Oh, but wait, no, the 1.4 ppm is a doublet of 3H. That might be a CH3 group attached to a CH2, like a CH(CH3) group or maybe a CH2-CH2-CH3 structure? Or perhaps it's a geminal group, like CH2-C(CH3)2. Hmm,
