Okay, so I've got this question about stars and parallax. Hmm, I remember that parallax is related to distance. The formula I think is distance d = 1/plx, where plx is the parallax in parsecs. Right, because parallax is measured in arcseconds, and one parsec is the distance where the parallax is 1 arcsecond.

The question is about how the number of stars per unit range of parallax changes with plx. So it's asking about the distribution of stars in terms of their parallax values. Since stars are uniformly distributed, I guess that means their actual distances are spread out in some way, but how does that translate into the parallax space?

Wait, parallax is inversely proportional to distance. So farther stars have smaller parallax. If stars are uniformly distributed in space, their distances would be spread out, but when you convert that to parallax, since plx = 1/d, the distribution probably isn't uniform anymore.

I need to find dN/dplx, the number of stars per unit parallax. Let's think about the volume of space. The number of stars in a volume is proportional to the volume. So for a thin shell at distance d with thickness dd, the volume is 4π d² dd. Since stars are uniformly distributed, the number of stars in that shell would be proportional to 4π d² dd.

But since plx = 1/d, d = 1/plx. So let's express everything in terms of plx. Let's substitute d = 1/plx.

So the number of stars in a thin shell at plx is proportional to d^2 * dd. Wait, but wait, the shell's volume is 4π d² dd. So substituting d, that becomes 4π (1/plx)^2 * (d d). But wait, dd is the change in d, but since d = 1/plx, a change in plx (dP) would relate to dd. Let me think: d = 1/plx → dd = - (1/plx²) dplx. The negative sign indicates that as plx increases, d decreases. But since we're considering dN/dP, maybe we can take absolute values.

So the number of stars per unit plx (dN/dplx) would be proportional to (d^2) * (dd) / dP. Wait, no, wait. Let me clarify.

The number of stars in a shell at distance d is N = n *
