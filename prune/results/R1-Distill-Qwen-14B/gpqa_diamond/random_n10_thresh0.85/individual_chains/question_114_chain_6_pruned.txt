Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question is about.

The problem has two parts. The first part is a reaction: butan-2-one reacting with NaCN and reagent A to produce 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. The second part is another reaction where 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile reacts with reagent B (which is H2O) to form 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid. The options give different possibilities for A and B, and I need to choose the correct pair.

Hmm, I think I'll break this down into two separate reactions.

Starting with the first reaction: butan-2-one (which is methylacetone, (CH3)2CO) reacts with NaCN. I remember that when ketones react with cyanide, it's a nucleophilic addition. But wait, under what conditions does that happen? Oh right, I think it's typically done under acidic conditions. So, the reagent A is probably an acid, like H3O+ (which is just an acid catalyst) or maybe something else.

Wait, but wait. Another thought: sometimes, in the presence of a strong acid, the ketone can undergo a reaction called acid-catalyzed addition of HCN. But wait, in this case, the reagent is NaCN. So, maybe it's a two-step processâ€”NaCN provides CN- ions, which under acidic conditions can attack the carbonyl.

Let me think about the product. The product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. So, the structure would be CH2(CO2H)(CN)CH3? Wait, no. Let me draw it. Butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO. After adding CN, the product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Wait, butanenitrile is CH3CH2CH2CN, but in this case, the structure is 2-hydroxy-2-methyl: so the nitrile group is on the same carbon as the hydroxyl group and a methyl group. So, the molecule is (CH3)2C(OH)CN. Wait, that's a bit confusing.

Alternatively, maybe the product is (CH3)2C(OH)CH2CN? No, the name is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Butanenitrile is four carbons, with CN on the first carbon. So the structure would be CH2CH2CH2CN, but with substituents. Wait, but butane is four carbons, so butanenitrile is CH2CH2CH2CN. No, wait, butane is CH3CH2CH2CH2, so butanenitrile is CH2CH2CH2CN, but the numbering would be from the nitrile end. Oh wait, but butanenitrile is CH2CH2CH2CH2CN, but that's pentanenitrile. Hmm, maybe I need to draw it.

Wait, perhaps butanenitrile is CH2CH2CNCH2, but wait, that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, the correct structure would be CH2CH2CNCH3? No, wait, butane is four carbons. So, butanenitrile
