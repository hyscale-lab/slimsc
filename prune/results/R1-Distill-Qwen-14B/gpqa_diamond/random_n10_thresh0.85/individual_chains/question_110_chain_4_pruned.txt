Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about stars and which ones can be detected by two different spectrographs: ESPRESSO at Paranal and HIRES at Keck. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my astronomy, but let's think through this.

The question gives me five stars (Star1 to Star5) each with different parameters. The key thing is that each spectrograph has a different limit on the apparent V magnitude of the stars they can observe. So I need to figure out the apparent magnitude for each star and see if it's below the limit for both instruments.

Wait, the problem says that ESPRESSO can observe stars brighter than V magnitude 17, right? So apparent magnitude less than or equal to 17, because lower magnitudes are brighter. And HIRES can go up to 16.5, I think, because it says brighter than 16 V mag. Wait, no, wait. Let me read again. It says, "stars with apparent V magnitudes brighter than 17 mag can be observed with ESPRESSO" — so if a star's apparent magnitude is less than 17, ESPRESSO can see it. Similarly for HIRES, less than 16 mag? Because "brighter than 16 V mag". Oh wait, the way it's written: "brighter than 17" for ESPRESSO. So if a star is brighter (smaller magnitude number) than 17, it can be observed. So for a star to be detectable by both, its apparent magnitude must be less than both 17 and 16, because HIRES has a lower limit. So the star's V mag must be ≤16.

Wait, no. If a star is brighter than 17, it's visible to ESPRESSO. But for HIRES, it's only visible if it's brighter than 16. So the star must be brighter than 16. Because if it's brighter than 17, it's also brighter than 16, right? So the more stringent condition is the brighter than 16 for HIRES. So the star must have apparent V magnitude less than 16. Wait, no. Let me clarify:

ESPRESSO: V mag ≤17
HIRES: V mag ≤16
So the star needs to be within both. So the maximum V for both is 16, because if a star is brighter than 16, it's within both. So any
