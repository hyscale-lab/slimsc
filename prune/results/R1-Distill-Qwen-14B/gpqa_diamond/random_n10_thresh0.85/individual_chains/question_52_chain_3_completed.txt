Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let's see what it's about. Hmm, the question is about a star with certain characteristics and how the presence of dark spots affects the ratio of neutral Titanium (Ti) atoms in two energy levels. The options are given, and I need to find the factor by which this ratio changes.

Alright, let's break it down. The star has a radius of 1.5 solar radii and a mass of 1.1 solar masses. When there are no spots, its effective temperature (Teff) is 6000 K. But when 40% of the surface is covered by spots, the overall Teff drops to 5500 K. Wait, dark spots on a star would typically be cooler regions, right? So when spots cover part of the surface, the observed effective temperature should decrease because those spots emit less light. That makes sense with the given data.

Now, the main part of the question is about the ratio of the number of neutral Ti atoms in two energy levels (level 1 and level 2) when the star has spots versus when it doesn't. The ratio decreases when the star has spots. Hmm, why would the ratio change?

I remember that in stellar atmospheres under Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE), the distribution of atoms between energy levels is described by the Boltzmann equation. The Boltzmann factor tells us that the ratio of populations of two energy levels is proportional to exp(-ΔE/(kT)), where ΔE is the energy difference between the levels, k is the Boltzmann constant, and T is the temperature.

So the ratio (n1/n2) should be proportional to exp( (E2 - E1)/(kT) ) if E2 > E1. Wait, no, wait. Let me get that right. The Boltzmann equation says that the ratio of the number of particles in two states, n_i/n_j, is equal to (g_i/g_j) * exp( -(E_i - E_j)/(k T) ), where g_i and g_j are the statistical weights. So if E_i > E_j, the exponent is negative, which would make the ratio smaller if the temperature is lower. Because  exp(-x) decreases as x increases.

In this problem, the ratio n1/n2 decreases when the star has spots. So when the spots are present, the photospheric temperature is lower (5500 K) compared to when it's spot-free (6000 K). Let me think about what that does to the ratio.

Wait, let's say the energy levels are E1 and E2, with E2 higher than E1. Then, the ratio n1/n2 = (g1/g2) * exp( (E2 - E1)/(k T) ). If T decreases, the exponent becomes a larger negative number, making the exponential term smaller. So n1/n2 decreases when T decreases.

That's exactly what's observed here. When the star has spots, Teff is lower, so the ratio n1/n2 drops. So the question is asking for the factor by which this ratio changes. That is, (n1/n2)_no_spots / (n1/n2)_with_spots.

So the factor is [ (n1/n2)_6000K ] / [ (n1/n2)_5500K ].

But n1/n2 is proportional to exp( (E2 - E1)/(k T) ). Let me write the ratio as:

Factor = [ exp( (E2 - E1)/(k * 6000) ) ] / [ exp( (E2 - E1)/(k * 5500) ) ]

Which simplifies to exp( (E2 - E1)/(k) [ 1/6000 - 1/5500 ] )

Let me compute 1/6000 - 1/5500. 1/6000 is approximately 0.00016667, and 1/5500 is approximately 0.00018182. So 0.00016667 - 0.00018182 is negative, about -0.00001515.

Wait, but wait, let me compute it more accurately. Let me find a common denominator for 6000 and 5500.

6000 = 6 * 1000
5500 = 5.5 * 1000 → 11/2 * 1000.

The least common multiple (LCM) of 6000 and 5500 is the LCM of 6 and 11/2) * 1000. Hmm, perhaps better to compute it as fractions.

1/6000 - 1/5500 = (5500 - 6000)/(6000 * 5500) ) = (-500)/(6000 * 5500) = (-500)/(33,000,000) ) = -5/(330,000) ) = -1/(66,000) ≈ -1.515e-5.

So 1/6000 - 1/5500 = -1/(66,000) ≈ -1.515e-5.

So the exponent becomes (E2 - E1)/(k) * (-1.515e-5).

But wait, E2 - E1 depends on the transition wavelength. The transition between the two levels is at 1448 Angstroms. I think that's in the extreme ultraviolet or far UV. So the energy difference can be found using E = hc/λ.

h is Planck's constant, c speed of light.

E = hc/(λ) → but I need to calculate ΔE.

Wait, the energy difference between level 2 and level 1 is ΔE = E2 - E1 = hc/λ.

So let's compute ΔE in terms of (kT), because that's what's in the exponent.

But wait, the exponent is (E2 - E1)/(k T) = (ΔE)/(k T) = (hc/λ)/(k T).

So the exponent is (hc)/(λ k T).

So putting this all together, the factor is:

Factor = exp[ (ΔE/(k)) (1/6000 - 1/5500) ) ]

Wait, no. Let me re-express the factor correctly.

Factor = exp( (E2 - E1)/(k) [1/(6000) - 1/(5500)] )

Which is exp( [ (E2 - E1) / (k) ] * (1/6000 - 1/5500) )

But E2 - E1 = hc/λ, so:

Factor = exp( [ (hc/λ) / k ] * (1/6000 - 1/5500) )

So let's compute hc/(λ k), which is a common term. Let's compute hc/(λ k T) for each temperature, but since we're taking the difference, it's a bit tricky.

Wait, perhaps I can compute the exponent as:

(ΔE/(k)) * (1/Teff1 - 1/Teff2) )

Wait, because in the factor, it's [ (ΔE/(k)) * (1/6000 - 1/5500) ]

So ΔE/(k) = hc/(k λ)

So exponent = [ hc/(k λ) ] * (1/6000 - 1/5500 )

Which can be rewritten as [ hc/(k λ) ] * ( (5500 - 6000) ) / (6000 * 5500) )

Wait, 1/6000 - 1/5500 = (5500 - 6000)/(6000 * 5500) ) = (-500)/(33,000,000) ) = -1/(66,000) )

So exponent = [ hc/(k λ) ] * (-1/(66,000) )

But let me compute this value numerically.

First, let's compute hc/(k λ):

h = 6.626e-34 J·s

c = 3e8 m/s

λ = 1448 Å = 1448e-10 m = 1.448e-7 m

k = 1.38e-23 J/K

So hc = 6.626e-34 * 3e8 = 1.9878e-25 J·m

hc/(k λ) = (1.9878e-25 J·m) / (1.38e-23 J/K * 1.448e-7 m )

Let me compute denominator: 1.38e-23 * 1.448e-7 = 1.38 *1.448 * 1e-30 = approx 1.997e-30.

Wait, 1.38e-23 * 1.448e-7 = (1.38 *1.448) * 1e-23-7 = ~1.998 * 1e-30.

So hc/(k λ) = (1.9878e-25) / (1.998e-30) ) = (1.9878 / 1.998) ) * 1e5 ≈ (0.995) * 1e5 ≈ 99500 ≈ 1e5.

So approximately, hc/(k λ) ≈ 1e5 K.

Wait, that's a rough calculation. Let me do it more accurately.

Compute the denominator: 1.38e-23 J/K * 1.448e-7 m = 1.38 * 1.448 = approx 1.999 → 1.999e-30 J·m/K.

So hc is 6.626e-34 *3e8 = 1.9878e-25 J·m.

So hc/(k λ) = (1.9878e-25) / (1.999e-30) ) → 1.9878e-25 / 1.999e-30 = (1.9878/1.999) * 1e5 → approx 0.994 * 1e5 → 9.94e4 ≈ 99400 K.

So hc/(k λ) ≈ 99400 K.

So exponent becomes [ 99400 K ] * ( -1 / 66,000 )

Which is approximately 99400 / 66,000 ≈ 1.506 approx.

But wait, the 1/66000 is multiplied by 99400, which is around 1.506.

But since it's (1/6000 - 1/5500) = negative, exponent is negative.

So exponent ≈ -1.506.

So the factor is exp(-1.506). What is exp(-1.506)?

We know that exp(-1) is about 0.3679, exp(-2) is about 0.1353. 1.506 is between 1 and 2, closer to 1.5.

Let me compute it more accurately.

ln(2) is 0.693, ln(3)=1.098, ln(5)=1.609. Wait, but I just want to compute exp(-1.506).

Alternatively, using a calculator approximation.

But I don't have a calculator right now; I can estimate it.

We can compute exp(-1.5) ≈ 0.2231.

Wait, 1.506 is about 0.006 more than 1.5. So let's compute the correction.

Using the Taylor series expansion around x=1.5:

exp(x) ≈ exp(1.5) + (x-1.5) * exp(1.5) + ... but since x is 1.506, it's 1.5 + 0.006.

Wait, no, in this case, the exponent is -1.506, so x = -1.506.

Hmm, perhaps better to use the exact value.

Wait, another approach: 1.506 ≈ 1.5 + 0.006.

exp(-1.5) ≈ 0.2231.

Then, exp(-1.506) = exp(-1.5) * exp(-0.006) ≈ 0.2231 * (1 - 0.006 + (0.006)^2/2) ) ≈ 0.2231 * (0.994 + 0.000018) ≈ 0.2231 * 0.994 ≈ 0.2218.

So approximately 0.222.

Wait, but the factor is the ratio when no spots (6000 K) over when spots (5500 K), which is exp( exponent ). So the exponent is (ΔE/(k)) * (1/6000 - 1/5500 ) which came out to approximately -1.506.

So exp(-1.506) ≈ 0.222.

Wait, but the factor is [n1/n2]_6000 / [n1/n2]_5500 = exp( (E2-E1)/(k) (1/6000 - 1/5500) )

Which is exp( exponent ) = exp( -1.506 ) ≈ 0.222.

Wait, but wait, that would mean the ratio when no spots is about 0.222 times the ratio when spots are present. But the problem states that when the star has spots, the ratio decreases. So if the ratio when spots are present is lower, the factor (no_spots / with_spots) is greater than 1.

Wait, no. Wait, let me think again.

The ratio n1/n2 is proportional to exp( (E2 - E1)/(k T) )

When T is 6000 K, it's exp( (ΔE)/(k*6000) )

When T is 5500 K, it's exp( (ΔE)/(k*5500) )

So the factor is [ exp(ΔE/(k*6000) ) ] / [ exp(ΔE/(k*5500) ) ] = exp( ΔE/(k) (1/6000 - 1/5500) )

Which is exp( negative number ), which is a small number.

So the factor is less than 1, meaning [n1/n2]_no_spots is smaller than [n1/n2]_spots? Wait, no.

Wait, wait. Let's re-examine.

No, the problem says that when the star has spots, the ratio decreases. So when spots are present, n1/n2 is lower. So when T is lower (5500 K), n1/n2 is lower.

So the question is, what is (n1/n2)_no_spots / (n1/n2)_with_spots?

Which is equal to exp( [ (ΔE/k) (1/6000 - 1/5500) ] )

Which is exp( (ΔE/k) [ (5500 -6000)/(6000*5500) ] )

Which is exp( (ΔE/k) * ( -500 / (6000*5500) ) )

So that's the same as exp( - (ΔE/k) * (500 / (6000*5500) ) * ( ... ) )

Wait, but earlier I computed the exponent as approximately -1.506, which would make the factor about exp(-1.506) ≈ 0.222. So the factor is ~0.222, which is less than 1. But the problem states that the ratio decreases when the star has spots. So the factor is (n1/n2)_no_spots / (n1/n2)_spots = 0.222, which means (n1/n2) is lower when the star has spots, which matches the problem statement.

Wait, but the question is asking for the factor by which the ratio changes when the star doesn't have spots compared to when it does. So the ratio is higher when the star doesn't have spots, meaning the factor is > 1. But according to my calculation, it's about 0.222, which is less than 1. That doesn't make sense. Did I make a mistake in the calculation?

Wait, perhaps I got the exponent wrong. Let me re-express the factor.

Factor = (n1/n2)_6000 / (n1/n2)_5500 = [ exp( (ΔE)/(k*6000) ) ] / [ exp( (ΔE)/(k*5500) ) ] 

= exp( (ΔE/k) (1/6000 - 1/5500) )

Which is the same as exp( (ΔE/(k)) * ( (5500 - 6000)/(6000 * 5500) ) )

= exp( (ΔE/(k)) * ( (-500) ) / (33,000,000) ) )

= exp( (ΔE/(k)) * (-1/66,000) )

So the exponent is negative.

That gives a factor less than 1, meaning (n1/n2)_6000 < (n1/n2)_5500. But the problem says when the star has spots, the ratio decreases. So (n1/n2)_spots = (n1/n2)_5500 is lower than (n1/n2)_6000. So the factor is (n1/n2)_6000 / (n1/n2)_5500, which is 0.222, meaning that [n1/n2]_6000 is 0.222 times [n1/n2]_5500. Which would mean that [n1/n2]_6000 is lower than [n1/n2]_5500, which contradicts the problem statement.

Wait, that can't be right. Because if the star has spots (lower T), then n1/n2 should decrease. So [n1/n2]_5500 is lower than [n1/n2]_6000. Which would mean that the factor is (n1/n2)_6000/(n1/n2)_5500 = 0.222, but that would mean (n1/n2)_6000 is 0.222 times (n1/n2)_5500, implying (n1/n2)_6000 < (n1/n2)_5500, which is the opposite of what the problem says.

Wait, this is confusing. Let me think again. Let's restate the problem: when the star has spots, the overall Teff is 5500 K. The ratio (n1/n2) decreases when the star has spots. So [n1/n2]_spots = [n1/n2]_5500 < [n1/n2]_6000.

So the factor is [n1/n2]_6000 / [n1/n2]_5500 = x, where x is greater than 1. Because the numerator is bigger than the denominator.

But according to my calculation, x is about 0.222, which is less than 1. That's a problem. So I must have messed up the exponent sign.

Wait, let me re-express the ratio:

(n1/n2) is proportional to exp( (E2 - E1)/(k T) )

So when T is 6000, it's higher than 5500. So (E2-E1)/(k T) is higher at 6000 K than at 5500 K.

Assuming E2 > E1 (since the transition is from a lower to higher energy), so (E2-E1) is positive.

So for higher T, (E2-E1)/(k T) is smaller. Therefore, exp( that ) is smaller, so n1/n2 is smaller.

Wait, wait, no. Because (E2-E1) is positive. So (E2-E1)/(k T) is higher at lower T. So for T=6000, (E2-E1)/(k T) is smaller than at T=5500.

Wait, no, wait. Let's compute (E2-E1)/(k T) for T=6000 and T=5500.

At T1=6000 K: x1 = (E2-E1)/(k * 6000)

At T2=5500 K: x2 = (E2-E1)/(k * 5500)

So x1 < x2, since denominator is smaller for T2.

Because 5500 < 6000, so 1/5500 > 1/6000 → x2 > x1.

So exp(x1) < exp(x2). So (n1/n2)_6000 = exp(x1) < exp(x2) = (n1/n2)_5500.

Which would mean that [n1/n2]_6000 < [n1/n2]_5500.

But the problem states that when the star has spots (5500 K), the ratio decreases. So [n1/n2]_5500 < [n1/n2]_6000.

But according to the above, [n1/n2]_5500 is higher. That's a contradiction.

Hmm, something's wrong here. Maybe I have the numerator and denominator reversed. Let me think again.

Wait, in the Boltzmann equation, n_i/n_j = (g_i/g_j) exp( -(E_i - E_j)/(k T) )

So if E_i > E_j, then -(E_i - E_j) is negative, so the exponential is exp( negative ), making n_i/n_j small.

So the higher the energy level, the lower the population (if E_i > E_j and T is same).

So for two levels 1 and 2, with E2 > E1:

n2/n1 = (g2/g1) exp( -(E2-E1)/(k T) )

So n2/n1 decreases as T decreases because the exponent becomes more negative.

Therefore, n1/n2 = 1/(n2/n1) = (g1/g2) exp( (E2-E1)/(k T) )

Wait, no. Because n1/n2 = (n2/n1)^{-1} → [ (g2/g1) exp( -(E2-E1)/(k T) ) ]^{-1} → (g1/g2) exp( (E2-E1)/(k T) )

So when T increases, (E2-E1)/(k T) decreases, so exp( (E2-E1)/(k T) ) decreases, so n1/n2 decreases as T increases.

Wait, that's opposite to what I thought earlier. Hmm.

Wait, let me take an example. Suppose E2-E1 is positive. Then, if T increases, (E2-E1)/(k T) becomes smaller. So exp(... ) is smaller, so n1/n2 is smaller. So for higher T, n1/n2 is smaller. So when T is 6000, n1/n2 is lower than when T is 5500.

Wait, no, no—if T is higher, the exponent (E2-E1)/(k T) is smaller.

For example, E2-E1 = 10^(-19) J.

At T=5500 K: (1e-19)/(1.38e-23 * 5500) ≈ (1e-19)/(7.59e-20) ≈ 13.18 → exponent is 13.18, exp(13.18) is huge.

Wait, but that can't be right because E2-E1 would be in the range of a few eV. Let me compute E2-E1 in eV.

Wait, 1 eV is 1.6e-19 J. Let's compute E = hc/lambda.

h = 6.626e-34 J s

c = 3e8 m/s

lambda = 1448 A = 1448e-10 m.

E = (6.626e-34)(3e8)/(1448e-10) = (1.9878e-25)/(1.448e-7) → approx 1.372e-18 J.

Convert to eV: 1 eV = 1.6e-19 J → E = 1.372e-18 / 1.6e-19 ≈ 8.575 eV.

So E2-E1 ≈ 8.575 eV.

k is 8.617e-5 eV/K.

So (E2-E1)/(k) ≈ 8.575 / (8.617e-5) ≈ 99,500 K.

So (E2-E1)/(k T) at T=6000 K is 99500 / 6000 ≈ 16.583.

At T=5500 K, it's 99500 /5500 ≈ 18.09.

So in both cases, (E2-E1)/(k T) is a large positive number. So exp(16.58) and exp(18.09) are huge numbers, but their ratio is exp(16.583 -18.09) = exp(-1.507) ≈ 0.221.

Wait, so (n1/n2)_6000 = exp(16.583) ≈ 8e7 (because exp(16) is about 8.89e6, so 16.5 is about 8e7?), and (n1/n2)_5500 = exp(18.09) ≈ 1.5e8.

Wait, but wait, wait: No, this can't be right. Because n1 and n2 are populations of energy levels. If E2 is higher than E1, and the temperature is high enough that the Boltzmann factor is 1, then n2 would be much higher than n1. But wait, in reality, for E2-E1 of 8.5 eV, even at high temperatures like 5500 K, the Boltzmann factor is exp(-8.5 / (k T in eV)).

Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused with units. Let me recompute using eV and K.

E2-E1 = 8.575 eV.

k = 8.617e-5 eV/K.

So (E2-E1)/(k) = 8.575 / (8.617e-5) ≈ approximately 99,500 K.

So (E2-E1)/(k T) at T=6000 K is 99500 /6000 ≈ 16.58.

At T=5500 K, it's 99500 /5500 ≈ 18.09.

So exp(16.58) is a huge number, and exp(18.09) is even larger. So (n1/n2)_6000 = exp(16.58), and (n1/n2)_5500 = exp(18.09).

So the ratio (n1/n2)_6000 / (n1/n2)_5500 is exp(16.58 - 18.09) = exp(-1.51) ≈ 0.221.

So the ratio when the star has spots is (n1/n2)_5500 ≈ exp(18.09) ≈ 1.3e8, and without spots, it's exp(16.58) ≈ 9e7. So (n1/n2)_6000 is about 0.221 times (n1/n2)_5500. So the ratio is lower when the star doesn't have spots than when it does. But the problem says that when the star has spots, the ratio decreases. So this contradicts.

Wait, no. The ratio (n1/n2) is higher when T is lower (because (E2-E1)/(k T) is higher, exp of that is higher). So for T=5500, (E2-E1)/(k T) is higher, so exp(...) is higher → n1/n2 is higher. So when the star has spots, the ratio is higher, but the problem states that the ratio decreases. So I must have made a mistake in defining which level is which.

Ah, I think I mixed up E1 and E2. Because if E1 is higher than E2, then n1/n2 = (g1/g2) exp( (E2-E1)/(k T) ), which is a small number. But the problem states that the ratio decreases when spots are present, so when T decreases.

So perhaps E1 is lower than E2. Let me re-express.

Let me let E1 < E2.

n1/n2 = (g1/g2) exp( (E2 - E1)/(k T) )

So when T increases, the exponent (E2-E1)/(k T) decreases → exp(...) decreases → n1/n2 decreases.

So when T is higher (6000), n1/n2 is lower.

When T is lower (5500), n1/n2 is higher.

But the problem states that when the star has spots (T=5500), the ratio decreases. So when T is lower, the ratio is lower. That's the opposite of what the Boltzmann equation suggests.

Wait, this is getting me really confused. Wait, perhaps I should approach it more carefully.

Let me define the two levels: level 1 and level 2. Let's say level 1 is lower in energy than level 2.

So E1 < E2.

The ratio n1/n2 = (g1/g2) exp( (E2 - E1)/(k T) )

Because (E2-E1) is positive.

So when T increases, (E2-E1)/(k T) decreases → exp( ... ) decreases → n1/n2 decreases.

So n1/n2 is higher at lower temperatures.

So when the star has spots (lower T), n1/n2 is higher.

But the problem states that when the star has spots, the ratio decreases. So when T is lower, ratio is lower.

This contradicts.

So perhaps I have the levels reversed.

Alternative approach: Perhaps the transition is from a higher energy level to a lower one. So when the star emits at 1448 Å, the electron is jumping from level 2 to level 1, where level 2 is higher than level 1.

In that case, the population ratio would be n2/n1 = (g2/g1) exp( -(E2-E1)/(k T) )

So n2/n1 decreases when T increases.

So when T is higher, more population in level 1.

So the ratio n1/n2 would be (n2/n1)^-1 = (g1/g2) exp( (E2-E1)/(k T) )

Wait, but that brings us back to the same situation.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think in terms of excitation. For lower T, the higher energy level (level 2) is less populated relative to level 1. So n2 decreases more than n1 as T decreases.

Wait, let me think: At a given T, more atoms are in lower energy levels. So for lower T, n2/n1 is lower.

So if E2 > E1, then n2/n1 = (g2/g1) exp( -(E2-E1)/(k T) )

So for lower T, the exponent is more negative, so n2/n1 is smaller → n1/n2 is larger.

So when T decreases, n1/n2 increases.

But the problem says that when the star has spots (lower T), the ratio decreases. So this can't be.

Hmm. I'm getting stuck here. Let me try a different approach.

The problem says that when the star has spots (T=5500 K), the ratio (n1/n2) decreases compared to when it's spot-free (6000 K). So [n1/n2]_5500 < [n1/n2]_6000. What does that imply?

It implies that (n1/n2) is higher at 6000 K than at 5500 K. So higher T leads to higher (n1/n2).

But according to the Boltzmann equation, (n1/n2) = (g1/g2) exp( (E2-E1)/(k T) )

So for higher T, (E2-E1)/(k T) is smaller → exp(...) is smaller → n1/n2 is smaller.

Which contradicts the observation that (n1/n2) is higher when T is higher.

Hmm, that's a problem. So perhaps my initial assumption about the transition is wrong. Maybe the photon is emitted when moving from level 1 to level 2, meaning that level 2 is lower in energy than level 1. So E1 > E2.

Then, the ratio n1/n2 = (g1/g2) exp( (E2-E1)/(k T) )

But E2-E1 is negative. So (E2-E1)/(k T) is negative.

So exp( negative ) is small.

So n1/n2 is small. Now, when T increases, (E2-E1)/(k T) becomes more negative (since denominator is larger). So exp( more negative ) is smaller. So n1/n2 decreases as T increases.

So when T is high (6000), n1/n2 is lower. When T is lower (5500), n1/n2 is higher. But the problem says that when T is lower (spots present), the ratio is lower. So again, this is a contradiction.

Wait, I'm getting really confused. Let me perhaps approach the problem from another angle.

The transition corresponds to a wavelength of ~1448 Å. That's in the UV range. So it's likely a transition from a lower energy level to a higher one.

Wait, when an electron jumps from a lower to higher energy level, it absorbs a photon. So if the star emits this photon, that suggests that the electron is moving from higher to lower energy, emitting a photon. So the transition from level 2 (higher) to level 1 (lower) emits a photon at 1448 Å.

So level 2 is higher than level 1.

So n2/n1 = (g2/g1) exp( -(E2-E1)/(k T) )

Since E2 > E1, (E2-E1) is positive, so this ratio is (g2/g1) exp( - positive )

So n2/n1 decreases as T increases.

So n1/n2 = 1/(n2/n1) → increases as T increases.

But the problem states that when T decreases (5500 K), the ratio n1/n2 decreases. So according to the equation, when T decreases, n1/n2 increases. But the problem says that when the star has spots, the ratio decreases. So this again is a contradiction.

Wait, perhaps the transition is from level 1 to level 2, meaning that E2 is higher than E1. So the transition occurs when an electron moves from level 1 to level 2, requiring absorption of a photon. So in the star's photosphere, this line would be in absorption if the gas is optically thick. But in any case, the ratio n2/n1 depends on T.

Given the confusion, perhaps I should proceed with the calculation as per the initial approach, assuming that the factor is about 0.222, but the options don't have 0.2. The options are A) ~1.1, B) ~7.8, C) ~4.5, D) ~2.9.

Wait, 0.222 is the reciprocal of ~4.5. So 1/0.222 is about 4.5.

Hmm, but I thought the factor was 0.222, which would mean the ratio is about 4.5 times lower when no spots. But the problem states that when spots are present, the ratio is lower. So when no spots, the ratio is higher.

Ah! Maybe I mixed up the order. The factor is (n1/n2)_no_spots / (n1/n2)_with_spots = 0.222. So (n1/n2)_no_spots = 0.222 * (n1/n2)_spots.

Which would imply that (n1/n2)_no_spots is lower than (n1/n2)_spots. But the problem says that when the star has spots, the ratio decreases. So (n1/n2)_spots < (n1/n2)_no_spots. So (n1/n2)_no_spots / (n1/n2)_spots = 0.222 would imply that (n1/n2)_no_spots is 0.222 times (n1/n2)_spots. Which would mean that (n1/n2)_no_spots is lower than (n1/n2)_spots. But the problem says that when the star has spots, the ratio decreases, so (n1/n2)_spots is lower than (n1/n2)_no_spots. So this can't be.

Wait, perhaps the factor is approximately 4.5, which is 1/0.222. So if the factor is (n1/n2)_no_spots / (n1/n2)_spots = 4.5, then (n1/n2)_no_spots is 4.5 times (n1/n2)_spots → which would mean (n1/n2)_no_spots is higher than (n1/n2)_spots. Which matches the problem statement.

So perhaps I made a mistake in the exponent calculation. Because earlier I thought the exponent was negative, making the factor 0.222, but perhaps I should take the reciprocal.

Let me re-express the factor.

The factor is (n1/n2)_6000 / (n1/n2)_5500 = exp( (E2-E1)/(k) (1/6000 - 1/5500) )

Which is exp( (E2-E1)/(k) * ( -500 / (6000*5500) ) )

Wait, but that's negative. So the factor is exp( negative ), less than 1.

But according to the problem, (n1/n2)_no_spots is higher than (n1/n2)_spots, so the factor should be greater than 1.

So perhaps I have the wrong sign. Let me double-check the sign.

(E2-E1)/(k) is positive because E2>E1.

(1/6000 - 1/5500) is negative.

So the product is negative. So the exponent is negative, so the factor is less than 1.

So this would imply that (n1/n2)_no_spots is less than (n1/n2)_spots, which contradicts the problem.

Hmm. I'm really stuck here. Maybe the way I calculated the exponent is wrong. Let me re-express the exponent.

The exponent is (E2-E1)/(k) * (1/6000 - 1/5500 )

Which is (ΔE)/(k) * (1/6000 - 1/5500 )

= (ΔE)/(k) * [ (5500 -6000) / (6000*5500) ) ]

= (ΔE)/(k) * ( (-500) / 33,000,000 )

= (ΔE)/(k) * (-1/66,000 )

So the exponent is negative.

So the factor is exp( negative ), so the ratio (n1/n2)_no_spots / (n1/n2)_spots is less than 1.

So (n1/n2)_no_spots < (n1/n2)_spots.

But the problem says that when the star has spots, the ratio decreases. So (n1/n2)_spots < (n1/n2)_no_spots.

This is a contradiction. I'm clearly making a mistake in setting up the problem.

Alternative approach: Perhaps the ratio is n2/n1 instead of n1/n2.

Because the problem states that the ratio decreases when the star has spots. So if n2/n1 decreases when T decreases, that would imply that n2/n1 is higher at higher T.

So let's compute the factor for n2/n1.

(n2/n1)_6000 / (n2/n1)_5500 = [ (g2/g1) exp( -(ΔE)/(k*6000) ) ] / [ (g2/g1) exp( -(ΔE)/(k*5500) ) ]

= exp( -(ΔE)/(k) (1/6000 - 1/5500) )

= exp( -(ΔE)/(k) * (-1/66,000) )

= exp( (ΔE)/(k * 66,000) )

Which is a positive exponent.

So the factor is exp( (ΔE)/(k * 66,000) )

Earlier, I computed (ΔE)/(k) ≈ 99500 K.

So (ΔE)/(k *66,000 ) = 99500 /66,000 ≈ 1.507.

So exp(1.507) ≈ 4.51.

So the factor is approximately 4.5.

Which matches option C) ~4.5.

Wait, but the question was about the ratio of n1/n2. So if (n2/n1)_no_spots / (n2/n1)_spots = 4.5, then (n2/n1)_no_spots = 4.5 * (n2/n1)_spots.

So (n2/n1)_no_spots is 4.5 times (n2/n1)_spots.

Which implies that (n2/n1) is higher when the star doesn't have spots, which would mean that (n1/n2) is lower when the star doesn't have spots.

But the problem states that the observed ratio (n1/n2) decreases when the star has spots. So (n1/n2)_spots < (n1/n2)_no_spots.

But according to our calculation, (n1/n2)_no_spots = 1/(n2/n1)_no_spots = 1/(4.5 * (n2/n1)_spots ) → which is (1/(4.5)) * (n1/n2)_spots → which is 0.222 * (n1/n2)_spots.

Which implies that (n1/n2)_no_spots is lower than (n1/n2)_spots, which contradicts the problem statement.

Wait, so I'm getting conflicting results. Perhaps the problem actually refers to the ratio (n2/n1), which would make sense. Because if (n2/n1) decreases when the star has spots (which would mean that more atoms are in the lower energy level when T is lower), that would align with the Boltzmann equation.

But the problem specifically states the ratio of n1/n2. So I'm stuck.

Alternatively, perhaps the factor I'm calculating is the reciprocal of what the problem is asking for.

The problem asks for the factor by which the ratio changes when the star does not have spots compared to when it has spots. So if the ratio (n1/n2)_no_spots is 0.222 times (n1/n2)_spots, the factor is 0.222, but the options don't have that. However, option C is 4.5, which is 1/0.222.

Wait, perhaps the question is asking for (n1/n2)_spots / (n1/n2)_no_spots, which would be 1/0.222 ≈4.5.

In that case, the factor is 4.5, which is option C.

But the problem states that the ratio decreases when the star has spots, so (n1/n2)_spots < (n1/n2)_no_spots → (n1/n2)_no_spots / (n1/n2)_spots = 0.222. But if the question is asking for the factor by which the ratio changes when the star does not have spots compared to when it has spots, it's (n1/n2)_no_spots / (n1/n2)_spots = 0.222, which is not one of the options. So perhaps I'm making a mistake in the setup.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute (n2/n1)_no_spots / (n2/n1)_spots, which is 4.5, which is option C.

But the problem is about (n1/n2), not (n2/n1).

Another possibility is that I mixed up the numerator and denominator in the factor.

Wait, the factor is [n1/n2]_no_spots / [n1/n2]_with_spots = exp( (ΔE/k) (1/6000 - 1/5500) )

Which is exp( negative ), approximately 0.222.

So the factor is 0.222. But none of the options is 0.222.

But the closest option is B) ~7.8, which is about 1/0.13.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the exponent. Let me re-calculate the value.

Earlier, I found that (E2-E1)/(k) ≈ 99500 K.

So (E2-E1)/(k) * (1/6000 - 1/5500) = 99500 * ( -1/66,000 ) ≈ -1.507.

But perhaps I should compute (E2-E1)/(k) more accurately.

Let me compute hc/(λ k) accurately.

h = 6.62607015e-34 J·s (exact, since it's a defined value now)

c = 299792458 m/s (exact)

λ = 1448 Å = 1448e-10 m = 1.448e-7 m.

k = 1.380649e-23 J/K (exact).

So compute hc = 6.62607015e-34 * 299792458 = ?

Let me compute 6.62607015e-34 * 3e8 = 1.987821045e-25 J·m.

But more accurately, 299792458 is approximately 2.99792458e8 m/s.

So 6.62607015e-34 * 2.99792458e8 = ?

6.62607015 * 2.99792458 ≈ 19.8646.

So 19.8646e-26 J·m = 1.98646e-25 J·m.

Now, hc/(k λ) = 1.98646e-25 J·m / (1.380649e-23 J/K * 1.448e-7 m )

Denominator: 1.380649e-23 * 1.448e-7 = 1.380649 * 1.448e-30 = approx 1.380649 * 1.448 ≈ 2.000e0 → 2.000e-30.

So hc/(k λ) = (1.98646e-25) / (2.000e-30) ) = 1.98646e5 ≈ 198646 ≈ 1.986e5 K.

So (E2-E1)/(k) = hc/(λ k) = 1.986e5 K.

So (E2-E1)/(k) ≈ 198646 K.

So (E2-E1)/(k) * (1/6000 - 1/5500) = 198646 * ( -1/66,000 )

Compute 198646 / 66,000:

66,000 * 3 = 198,000. So 198646 ≈ 3 * 66,000 + 646 → 3 + 646/66,000 ≈ 3.00978.

So 198646 /66,000 ≈ 3.00978.

So (E2-E1)/(k) * (delta) ≈ -3.00978.

So exponent is -3.00978.

So exp(-3.00978) ≈ exp(-3) is about 0.0498.

But wait, exp(-3) is approximately 0.0498, but what about exp(-3.00978)?

Approximately 0.0498 * exp(-0.00978) ≈ 0.0498 * 0.9903 ≈ 0.0494.

So the factor is approximately 0.0494.

But wait, that's way off. Because earlier I thought the factor is about 0.222, but this precise calculation gives 0.0494.

Wait, but the problem says that the ratio decreases when spots are present. So (n1/n2)_spots < (n1/n2)_no_spots → factor is (n1/n2)_no_spots / (n1/n2)_spots = 0.0494, which is about 0.05, but none of the options are close.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, earlier calculation:

hc/(k λ) = 1.986e-25 / (1.38e-23 * 1.448e-7) )

Denominator: 1.38e-23 * 1.448e-7 = 1.38 *1.448 * 1e-30.

1.38 *1.448 = about 1.999 → 1.999e-30.

So 1.986e-25 / 1.999e-30 = (1.986/1.999) * 1e5 → approx 0.993 * 1e5 → 99,300 K.

So (E2-E1)/(k) = 99,300 K.

Then, (E2-E1)/(k) * (1/6000 - 1/5500) ) = 99,300 * ( -1/66,000 ) = - (99,300 /66,000 ) ≈ -1.5045.

So exponent is -1.5045 → exp(-1.5045) ≈ 0.221.

Which brings us back to the same 0.221 factor.

So the factor is 0.221, which is not in the options. But the reciprocal is 4.52, which is option C.

But the problem states that the ratio (n1/n2) decreases when the star has spots, so (n1/n2)_spots < (n1/n2)_no_spots. So the factor (n1/n2)_no_spots / (n1/n2)_spots is greater than 1.

But according to our calculation, it's less than 1, which contradicts.

Unless, perhaps, I inverted the levels.

Wait, perhaps in the problem, the ratio is (n2/n1), not (n1/n2). So let's compute (n2/n1)_no_spots / (n2/n1)_spots.

Which is [ (g2/g1) exp( -(E2-E1)/(k*6000) ) ] / [ (g2/g1) exp( -(E2-E1)/(k*5500) ) ]

= exp( (E2-E1)/(k) (1/5500 - 1/6000) )

= exp( (99300) * ( (6000 -5500) )/(5500 *6000) ) )

= exp( 99300 * (500) / (33,000,000 ) )

= exp( 99300 * (1/66000) )

= exp( 99300 / 66000 )

≈ exp(1.5045) ≈ 4.50.

So the factor is exp(1.5045) ≈4.50.

Which is option C.

So perhaps the question actually refers to the ratio (n2/n1), which would make the factor about 4.5.

But the problem says the ratio of n1/n2 decreases when the star has spots. So if (n2/n1) increases, then (n1/n2) decreases, which matches the problem statement.

So the correct factor is 4.5, option C.


The problem involves determining the factor by which the ratio of the number of neutral Ti atoms in two energy levels, \( n_1/n_2 \), changes when a star transitions from having no spots (effective temperature \( T_{\text{eff}} = 6000 \, \text{K} \)) to having spots (\( T_{\text{eff}} = 5500 \, \text{K} \)). The ratio decreases when the star has spots, and the transition corresponds to a wavelength of \( \lambda = 1448 \, \text{Å} \). The analysis proceeds as follows:

1. **Boltzmann Equation**: The ratio \( n_1/n_2 \) is governed by the Boltzmann equation:
   \[
   \frac{n_1}{n_2} = \frac{g_1}{g_2} \exp\left(\frac{E_2 - E_1}{kT}\right),
   \]
   where \( E_2 - E_1 \) is the energy difference between the two levels, \( k \) is the Boltzmann constant, and \( T \) is the temperature.

2. **Energy Difference**: The energy difference \( E_2 - E_1 \) is calculated using the transition wavelength \( \lambda \):
   \[
   E_2 - E_1 = \frac{hc}{\lambda},
   \]
   where \( h \) is Planck's constant and \( c \) is the speed of light. Substituting \( \lambda = 1448 \, \text{Å} = 1.448 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{m} \), \( h = 6.626 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J·s} \), and \( c = 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \), we find:
   \[
   E_2 - E_1 \approx 8.575 \, \text{eV}.
   \]

3. **Exponent Calculation**: The ratio \( n_1/n_2 \) depends on the exponent \( \frac{E_2 - E_1}{kT} \). Using \( k = 8.617 \times 10^{-5} \, \text{eV/K} \), the exponent becomes:
   \[
   \frac{E_2 - E_1}{kT} \approx \frac{8.575}{8.617 \times 10^{-5} \cdot T}.
   \]
   For \( T = 6000 \, \text{K} \), this gives:
   \[
   \frac{E_2 - E_1}{kT} \approx 16.58,
   \]
   and for \( T = 5500 \, \text{K} \), it gives:
   \[
   \frac{E_2 - E_1}{kT} \approx 18.09.
   \]

4. **Ratio of Ratios**: The factor by which the ratio \( n_1/n_2 \) changes is:
   \[
   \text{Factor} = \frac{(n_1/n_2)_{6000}}{(n_1/n_2)_{5500}} = \exp\left(\frac{E_2 - E_1}{k} \left(\frac{1}{6000} - \frac{1}{5500}\right)\right).
   \]
   Substituting \( \frac{E_2 - E_1}{k} \approx 99,500 \, \text{K} \) and \( \frac{1}{6000} - \frac{1}{5500} = -\frac{1}{66,000} \), the exponent becomes:
   \[
   \text{Exponent} = 99,500 \cdot \left(-\frac{1}{66,000}\right) \approx -1.507.
   \]
   Thus:
   \[
   \text{Factor} = \exp(-1.507) \approx 0.222.
   \]

5. **Interpretation**: The factor \( 0.222 \) indicates that \( (n_1/n_2)_{6000} \) is approximately \( 0.222 \) times \( (n_1/n_2)_{5500} \). However, the problem states that the ratio decreases when the star has spots, meaning \( (n_1/n_2)_{5500} < (n_1/n_2)_{6000} \). This implies the reciprocal of the calculated factor is relevant, giving:
   \[
   \text{Factor} \approx \frac{1}{0.222} \approx 4.5.
   \]

6. **Conclusion**: The factor by which the ratio \( n_1/n_2 \) changes is approximately \( 4.5 \), consistent with option C.

ANSWER: C
