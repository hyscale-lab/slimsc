Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about stars and their effective temperatures. Hmm, let me try to think through this step by step. I'm a bit rusty on my astrophysics, but I remember some basics about blackbody radiation and the Boltzmann distribution.

The question says that iron atoms in star_1's photosphere are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to star_2. Oh right, the photosphere is where the light is emitted, and under LTE (Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium), the excitation levels are determined by the thermal energy of the gas.

I recall that the excitation of atoms in a star's atmosphere is governed by the Boltzmann equation. The Boltzmann factor tells us the population ratio of atoms in different energy levels. The formula is something like (n_i / n_j) = (g_i / g_j) * exp( - (E_i - E_j)/(k T) ), where g is the statistical weight, E is energy, k is Boltzmann's constant, and T is temperature.

In this case, the problem gives that the iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited as those in star_2 for the same energy level. Wait, but both stars have the same energy difference between the levels, 1.38e-23 J. So E_i - E_j is the same for both, let's call it ΔE.

So, the ratio of excitation (n1/n2) for star_1 compared to star_2 is 2. But wait, wait. Wait, the statement says that the iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited. So, perhaps the ratio of their populations is 2:1? Or is it (n1)/(n_total) is twice (n2)/(n_total)? Hmm, wait, I think the question says that in star_1, the iron atoms are twice as excited in a specific level compared to star_2. So maybe the ratio of the excited state population in star_1 to that in star_2 is 2. So (n1_i)/(n1_j) = 2*(n2_i)/(n2_j), but wait, I'm not sure that's right. Alternatively, perhaps the excitation level is proportional to the population of the excited state.

Wait, no. Let me think again. The problem states that iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level. So, for the same transition, the number of atoms in a higher energy level (or the excitation) is higher. So if n is the population of the excited state, then n_1 / n_2 = 2. Or wait, maybe it's the ratio between the excited and ground states that is different. Oh, right, in the Boltzmann equation, the ratio is (n_i / n_j) = (g_i/g_j) exp( -ΔE/(k T) ). So for the same ΔE, but different temperatures, the ratio changes.

In this problem, the excitation is twice as much for star_1 as star_2. So the ratio n1_i / n1_j is twice (n2_i / n2_j)? Wait no, the problem says "iron atoms in the photosphere of star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level when compared to the iron atoms in star_2." So, perhaps the excitation parameter is the ionization or the population in the excited state. Alternatively, maybe the ratio of the excited state to the ground state in star_1 is twice that in star_2. So (n1_i / n1_j) = 2 * (n2_i / n2_j).

Wait, no. Let's clarify. Let me denote for each star, the ratio of the excited state to the ground state as R1 and R2 respectively. The problem states that R1 = 2 * R2. So R1 is twice R2.

So, R1 = (n1_i/n1_j) = 2 * (n2_i/n2_j) = 2 R2.

But according to the Boltzmann factor, for each star, R = (g_i/g_j) exp( -ΔE/(k T) )

Assuming g_i and g_j are the same for both stars (same element, same transition), then R1 = exp( -ΔE/(k T1) ), and R2 = exp( -ΔE/(k T2) ).

So according to the problem, R1 = 2 R2. So,

exp( -ΔE/(k T1) ) = 2 * exp( -ΔE/(k T2) )

Let me write that as:

exp( -ΔE/(k T1) ) / exp( -ΔE/(k T2) ) = 2

Which can be rewritten as exp( ΔE/(k T2) - ΔE/(k T1) ) = 2.

So the exponent becomes ΔE/(k) (1/T2 - 1/T1) ) = ln(2)

Because exp(x) = 2 implies x = ln(2).

So, [ΔE/(k)] (1/T2 - 1/T1) ) = ln(2)

Wait, let me compute that exponent:

ΔE/(k) (1/T2 - 1/T1) = ln(2).

Alternatively,

(ΔE)/(k) [ (T1 - T2) ) / (T1 T2) ) ] = ln(2)

Because 1/T2 - 1/T1 = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2 )

So,

(ΔE) (T1 - T2) ) / (k T1 T2 ) ) = ln(2)

But the question gives the equation for ln(2) in terms of T1 and T2. So, let's see what the options are.

Looking at the options, option D is ln(2) = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2). But wait, according to the equation I derived:

ln(2) = [ ΔE (T1 - T2) ] / [ k T1 T2 ]

But the options don't include ΔE or k, so perhaps the equation is presented without considering the constants. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the ratio of excitation and assuming the energy difference is fixed, so the temperature terms would dominate.

Wait, but in the problem, the energy difference is given, but in the equation the options don't include ΔE. So perhaps the given equation in the options is missing that factor, but the problem states that the energy difference is the same for both stars, so it's a constant.

But looking at the options, none of them have a ΔE. Hmm, maybe I'm missing something else.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering the ratio of the populations, but when both stars are at their own temperatures. So, perhaps the ratio is R1/R2 = 2.

R1 = exp( -ΔE/(k T1) )
R2 = exp( -ΔE/(k T2) )

So R1/R2 = exp( (ΔE/k)(1/T2 - 1/T1) ) = 2

So, (ΔE)/(k) (1/T2 - 1/T1) ) = ln 2

Which can be rearranged as:

(ΔE)/(k) ( (T1 - T2) ) / (T1 T2) ) = ln 2

So,

ln 2 = [ (ΔE)/(k) (T1 - T2) ) ] / (T1 T2 )

But in the options, they're missing the (ΔE/k) term, which is a constant. So perhaps the equation in the options is the equation we're supposed to choose, but without considering the constant terms.

Wait, but the options are just expressions in T1 and T2 with ln(2) equal to something. So perhaps the answer is option D: ln(2) = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2 ), but that would be ignoring the constants. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial approach.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the ratio of the excitation is given as n1_i / n1_j = 2 (n2_i / n2_j). So,

n1_i / n1_j = 2 * (n2_i / n2_j )

But using the Boltzmann factor,

(n_i/n_j) = exp( -ΔE/(k T) ), assuming g_i = g_j.

So,

exp( -ΔE/(k T1) ) = 2 * exp( -ΔE/(k T2) )

Which again, gives:

exp( (ΔE)/(k) (1/T2 - 1/T1) ) ) = 2

Taking natural logs,

(ΔE)/(k) (1/T2 - 1/T1) ) = ln 2

Multiply both sides by k/ΔE,

(1/T2 - 1/T1) ) = (k ln2)/(ΔE)

But the problem says that ΔE is given as 1.38e-23 J. Let me compute what (k ln2)/(ΔE) is, but maybe it's not necessary for choosing the equation.

Wait, the options don't include any of this, so perhaps the correct equation is ln(2) = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) ), which would be option D.

Wait, wait, no. Let me re-express the equation:

(1/T2 - 1/T1) ) = (k ln2)/(ΔE)

Which can be written as,

( (T1 - T2) ) / (T1 T2) ) = (k ln2)/(ΔE )

So,

ln 2 = [ (ΔE) (T1 - T2) ) ] / (k T1 T2 )

But this doesn't match any of the options directly because the options don't have the ΔE and k terms. So perhaps the question assumes that the ratio is such that, when you rearrange, the equation involving ln(2) is option D.

Wait, perhaps I should try to write the equation without the constants. Let's suppose that the equation is ln(2) = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2 ), which is option D.

But let me think again. Let me take the equation:

(ΔE/(k)) * ( (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) ) ) = ln(2)

Which rearranged is:

(T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) ) = (k ln(2)) / ΔE

But the question's options have ln(2) on the left side. So unless the equation is presented as (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) ) = (something), but the options have ln(2) equals an expression involving T1 and T2.

But in our derived equation, the left side is ln(2) with some constants, but the options don't include constants. So perhaps the correct option is the one that has the (T1-T2)/(T1 T2) term. Looking at the options:

Option D is ln(2) = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2)

So that would match the structure of our equation if we ignore the constants. But wait, the equation I have is ln(2) = [ΔE (T1-T2)]/(k T1 T2 )

So unless the question is assuming that (ΔE)/(k) is 1, which it's not; because ΔE is given as 1.38e-23 J, and Boltzmann's constant k is about 1.38e-23 J/K. Oh wait! Oh, because 1.38e-23 is exactly k, Boltzmann's constant.

Wait, ΔE is given as 1.38e-23 J, which is exactly k's value. So, ΔE = k.

That's an important point. So, ΔE = k. So, replacing in the equation:

ln(2) = [ (k) (T1 - T2) ] / (k T1 T2 )

The k's cancel out:

ln(2) = (T1 - T2) / (T1 T2 )

Which is exactly option D.

So the correct equation is ln(2) equals (T1 - T2) divided by (T1*T2), which is option D.


The problem involves determining the relationship between the effective temperatures of two stars (T₁ and T₂) based on the excitation levels of iron atoms in their photospheres. The key information provided is:

1. Iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to star_2.
2. The energy difference between the considered energy levels is ΔE = 1.38 × 10⁻²³ J.
3. The stellar photospheres are in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE), so the Boltzmann distribution applies.

### Key Analysis:
The excitation level of atoms in a specific energy state is governed by the Boltzmann factor:
\[
\frac{n_i}{n_j} = \frac{g_i}{g_j} \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{k T}\right),
\]
where \(n_i\) and \(n_j\) are the populations of the excited and ground states, \(g_i\) and \(g_j\) are the statistical weights, \(\Delta E\) is the energy difference, \(k\) is Boltzmann's constant, and \(T\) is the temperature.

For star_1 and star_2, the ratio of excitation levels is given as:
\[
\frac{n_{1,i}}{n_{1,j}} = 2 \cdot \frac{n_{2,i}}{n_{2,j}}.
\]
Using the Boltzmann factor for each star:
\[
\frac{n_{1,i}}{n_{1,j}} = \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{k T_1}\right), \quad \frac{n_{2,i}}{n_{2,j}} = \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{k T_2}\right).
\]
Substituting these into the excitation ratio:
\[
\exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{k T_1}\right) = 2 \cdot \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{k T_2}\right).
\]
Dividing through:
\[
\exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{k T_1} + \frac{\Delta E}{k T_2}\right) = 2.
\]
Taking the natural logarithm of both sides:
\[
-\frac{\Delta E}{k T_1} + \frac{\Delta E}{k T_2} = \ln(2).
\]
Factoring out \(\Delta E / k\):
\[
\frac{\Delta E}{k} \left(\frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1}\right) = \ln(2).
\]
Rewriting the term in parentheses:
\[
\frac{\Delta E}{k} \cdot \frac{T_1 - T_2}{T_1 T_2} = \ln(2).
\]
Now, note that \(\Delta E = k\) (since \(\Delta E = 1.38 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J}\), which matches the value of \(k\)). Substituting \(\Delta E = k\) into the equation:
\[
\frac{k}{k} \cdot \frac{T_1 - T_2}{T_1 T_2} = \ln(2),
\]
which simplifies to:
\[
\ln(2) = \frac{T_1 - T_2}{T_1 T_2}.
\]

### Conclusion:
The correct equation for the effective temperatures of the stars is:
\[
\ln(2) = \frac{T_1 - T_2}{T_1 T_2}.
\]
This matches **Option D**.
