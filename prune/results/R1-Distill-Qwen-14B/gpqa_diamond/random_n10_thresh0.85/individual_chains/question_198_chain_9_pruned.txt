Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here about cobalt complexes and their stability constants. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's try to think it through.

The question says we have a solution with Co(II) ions and thiocyanate ions. The total cobalt concentration is 1e-2 M, and the SCN- concentration is 0.1 M. The stability constants, beta1 to beta4, are given as 9, 40, 63, and 16. Wait, stability constants usually indicate how stable a complex is, right? So higher beta means a more stable complex.

We're supposed to find the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes. Hmm, dithiocyanato would mean it has two SCN- ligands. So, I think that's the Co(SCN)_2^2+ complex. But wait, I should recall the possible complexes. Cobalt can form various complexes with thiocyanate, like [Co(SCN)]^+, [Co(SCN)_2]^0, [Co(SCN)_3]^-, etc. But the exact charge might vary, but the problem mentions the stability constants for each. Let me think, the stability constants are for each step of complexation.

Wait, the stability constants (beta) are for the formation of each successive complex. So, beta1 is for the first ligand, beta2 for the second, and so on. So, for the first complex, [Co(SCN)]^2+ (since Co^2+ + SCN^- → Co(SCN)^2+), the beta1 is 9. Then, adding another SCN would form [Co(SCN)_2]^+, because each SCN contributes a negative charge. Wait, no, wait: Co^2+ with one SCN^- would be [Co(SCN)]^+ (since 2+ + (-) = +1). Then adding another SCN^- would give [Co(SCN)_2] with a charge of 0, because 2+ + 2*(-) = 0. Hmm, wait, no, because each SCN is a -1 charge. So Co^2+ plus one SCN^- would be [CoSCN]^+ (charge +1), plus another SCN^- would be [Co(SCN)_2]^0, then another SCN would be [Co(SCN)_3]^-.

Wait, but the beta values are given as β1 =9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16. So for each step, the beta is the formation constant for each additional ligand. So [CoSCN]^+ would have β1 =9. [Co(SCN)_2]^0 would have β2 =40. [Co(SCN)_3]^- would have β3=63. And the next would be [Co(SCN)_4]^2- with beta4=16.

But wait, I'm not sure about the charge sequence. Alternatively, maybe the complexes are [Co(SCN)_n]^{2-n} because each SCN is -1. So n=1 → [CoSCN]^+, n=2 → [Co(SCN)_2]^0, n=3 → [Co(SCN)_3]^-, n=4 → [Co(SCN
