Okay, so I have this astronomy problem to solve, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question says.

Alright, the question is about the luminosities of two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. The given information is that Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times that of Star_2, and its mass is also 1.5 times larger. The wavelengths at which they appear brightest are the same. Also, their radial velocities are 0 and 700 km/s respectively. The task is to find out by what factor the luminosity of Star_1 is greater than Star_2, assuming they radiate as black bodies.

Hmm. Okay, so the key concepts here are luminosity, blackbody radiation, and maybe Doppler effects since there's a mention of radial velocity. Wait, but the problem says to compute the luminosity based on blackbody radiation. So maybe the radial velocity part is a red herring? Or is it?

Wait, but the question says that the astronomers determined the wavelengths at which the stars appeared brightest, and they're the same. Oh, right. The peak wavelength for a blackbody is given by Wien's Law. Wien's Law says that the peak wavelength λ_max is proportional to 1/T, where T is the temperature. So λ_max = b / T, where b is Wien's displacement constant.

Since the peak wavelengths are the same for both stars, their temperatures must be the same. Because λ_max is same, T1 = T2. Because if λ_max1 = λ_max2, then T1 = T2.

Wait, so both stars have the same temperature. But their radii are different. Oh, right, because luminosity depends on radius squared and temperature to the fourth power. Because the Stefan-Boltzmann law says L = 4πR²σT⁴, where σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant.

So the luminosity ratio would be (R1² / R2²) * (T1⁴ / T2⁴). But since T1 = T2, the T terms cancel out. So the ratio is (R1/R2)². 

Wait, R1 is 1.5 times R2. So R1/R2 is 1.5. So (1.5)^2 is 2.25. So L1 would be 2.25 times L2. So the factor is about 2.25, which is option A.

But wait, wait a minute. The problem mentions radial velocities. Oh, but the question says that the stars radiate as black bodies, so perhaps the radial velocities might affect the observed wavelength, but since we're considering the actual emission (not the observed due to Doppler shift), maybe we can ignore the radial velocities in this calculation.

Wait, the problem says that the wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest (their λ_max) are the same. So that's their rest frame λ_max, right? Because if one is moving towards or away from us, it would shift the observed λ_max. But the question says the λ_max are the same, which suggests that their actual temperatures are the same. So the Doppler shift isn't affecting the calculation, because the observed λ_max would be different if they were moving, but the problem says the λ_max are same. So perhaps the radial velocities are a distraction, or maybe they're part of another aspect.

Wait, maybe the radial velocities affect the observed flux, but the question is about luminosity, which is the intrinsic brightness. So the observed flux would depend on velocity, but luminosity is an intrinsic property. So perhaps the radial velocities are irrelevant here. So the initial approach was correct.

So, the ratio of luminosities is (R1/R2)^2, since T is same. R1 is 1.5 R2, so (1.5)^2 is 2.25. So the factor is 2.25, so the answer is option A.

Wait, but looking at the options, option D is ~2.23. Oh, wait, perhaps I'm missing something. Because maybe the problem is talking about the peak wavelength as observed, which would be affected by the Doppler shift. So let me think again.

If the star is moving towards us (positive radial velocity), the observed wavelength would be blueshifted, and if moving away, redshifted. So if Star_2 has a radial velocity of 700 km/s, which is a significant speed, but how does that affect the observed λ_max?

Wait, the peak wavelengths are the same as observed. So let me model this. Suppose that Star_2 is moving towards us at 700 km/s, and Star_1 is stationary (radial velocity 0). The problem states that the wavelengths at which they appear brightest (the observed λ_max) are the same.

Wait, but if Star_2 is moving towards us, its emitted λ_max would be shifted to a shorter wavelength. So in order for the observed λ_max to be the same as Star_1's (which isn't moving), Star_2's emitted λ_max must be longer. Because when you have a blueshift, the observed λ is shorter than emitted. So to have same observed λ_max as Star_1, Star_2's emitted λ_max must be longer.

Hmm. Let me think. The Doppler effect formula for wavelength shift is λ_observed = λ_emitted * sqrt( (1 + v/c)/(1 - v/c) ) ), but wait, I might have the formula wrong. Alternatively, the relativistic Doppler shift formula is λ_obs = λ_emit * sqrt( (1 - beta)/(1 + beta) ) ), where beta is v/c. But wait, no—when a source is moving away, the observed wavelength is longer than emitted. So for Star_2, which is moving away, the observed λ would be longer than its emitted λ. But the problem says the observed λ_max is the same for both stars. So Star_2's emitted λ must be shorter, so that when it's blueshifted, it's pushed to a shorter wavelength. Wait, no, Star_2 has a radial velocity of 700 km/s. Radial velocity is 700, but is that towards or away? The question says radial velocities are 0 and 700 for Star_1 and Star_2 respectively. I think in astronomy, positive radial velocity usually indicates moving away (redshift), negative for moving towards (blueshift). So Star_2 is moving away at 700 km/s.

So the observed λ_max for Star_2
