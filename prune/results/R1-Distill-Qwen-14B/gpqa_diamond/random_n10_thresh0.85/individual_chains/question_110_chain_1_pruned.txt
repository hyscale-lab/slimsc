Okay, so I've got this question about which stars can be detected by two different spectrographs: ESPRESSO at Paranal and HIRES at Keck. Hmm, I remember that the brightness of a star, as observed from Earth, is crucial because the spectrographs have different limits. Let's try to break this down.

First, I'll recall the given information. ESPRESSO can observe stars with V magnitudes brighter than 17 mag. HIRES can go down to brighter than 16 mag. So, the stars must be brighter than their respective thresholds for each instrument.

Wait, but what's the V magnitude? The lower the number, the brighter the star. So, if a star's apparent V magnitude is less than 17, ESPRESSO can see it. Similarly, if it's less than 16, HIRES can. So, the star must be brighter than both 17 (for ESPRESSO) and 16 (for HIRES) to be visible with both. Wait no, that's not right. Because if a star is brighter than 16, it's automatically brighter than 17. So, the limiting factor is the lower of the two. Wait, no, that's not correct. Let me think again.

Wait, each spectrograph has its own limit. So, for a star to be detected by both, it must be brighter than 17 mag when observed by ESPRESSO (because ESPRESSO can't see fainter than 17) and brighter than 16 mag for HIRES. Wait, no. Wait, the way the
