Alright, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here about the Y-component of the intrinsic angular momentum operator for a muon. Hmm, okay, let me try to break this down step by step. I'm a bit rusty on angular momentum operators, but I'll give it a go.

The problem says that the operator A_y is represented by a 2x2 matrix, Ay = c·S, where c is h/(4π) and S is a given matrix. The matrix S has the first row as (0, -i) and the second row as (i, 0). So, I should probably write that down.

So, first, let me write out the matrix for Ay. Since c is h/(4π), multiplying each element of S by c gives:

Ay = (h/(4π)) * [[0, -i], [i, 0]]

I think I remember that these kinds of matrices come up with angular momentum operators. The eigenvalues and eigenvectors of such matrices would give the possible values of the component and their corresponding states.

The question is about finding the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of Ay. But the options are about which statements are correct during the calculation. Let's look at the options.

Option A: Imaginary parts are ±2πh, real parts ±h/(4π). Wait, eigenvalues of angular momentum components are usually real, right? Because the angular momentum operators are Hermitian. Oh, but wait, Ay as given... Let me check if Ay is Hermitian. The matrix S is [[0, -i], [i, 0]]. What's the conjugate transpose of S? The (1,2) element would become i, and (2,1) becomes -i. So the transpose would swap the off-diagonal elements. So S's conjugate transpose is [[0, i], [-i, 0]], which isn't the same as S. So S is not Hermitian. Hmm, but wait, the operator Ay is supposed to be part of the angular momentum, which should be Hermitian. Oh wait, wait, maybe I made a mistake. The intrinsic angular momentum is like spin, which is a vector operator, so each component should be Hermitian. So perhaps S is supposed to be Hermitian, but looking at S, it doesn't look like it. Or maybe I'm misunderstanding the setup.

Wait, maybe I should compute the eigenvalues of S first, then scale by c. Because Ay = c S, so eigenvalues of Ay are c times the eigenvalues of S.

So let's find the eigenvalues of S. The matrix S is 2x2:

[ 0   -i ]
[ i    0 ]

The eigenvalues λ satisfy det(S - λ I) = 0.

So determinant is |(-λ)(-λ) - (-i)(i)| = λ² - ( (-i)(i) ) = λ² - (1) because (-i)(i) is -i² = -( -1 )=1. So the equation is λ² -1 =0 → λ= ±1.

So the eigenvalues of S are +1 and -1. Therefore, the eigenvalues of Ay are c*(+1) and c*(-1). Since c is h/(4π), the eigenvalues a are h/(4π) and -h/(4π).

Wait, but what about the options? Option B says eigenvalues have imaginary parts ±
