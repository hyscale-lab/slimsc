Okay, so I have this physics problem here about the decay of a boson. Let me try to think through it step by step. Hmm. The question is about the allowed decay channels of a boson X with a mass of 6 GeV. 

First, I remember that bosons can decay into fermion-antifermion pairs if certain conditions are met. The Lagrangian given is L = -λ f ψ_f (ῡ + X) ψ_f. Wait, I think that's a typo in the question. Probably, the interaction term should involve the fermion fields. Let me see, the standard form is usually something like L = g ψ̄ ψ X or similar, which would imply that X couples to fermions.

So, the interaction term here is coupling the boson X to fermions. The mass of X is 6 GeV, so I need to figure out which fermion pairs can be produced when X decays.

The key here is the concept of on-shell decay, which requires the mass of the boson (M_X) to be greater than or equal to twice the mass of the fermion (2m_f). So, for each fermion f, we need M_X >= 2 m_f.

So, what are the masses of the known fermions? Let me list them:

- Up quark (u): very light, like ~1-2 MeV. So 6 GeV is way more than 2m_u.
- Down quark (d): similar, around 3-5 MeV.
- Strange quark (s): about 95-105 MeV.
- Charm quark (c): ~1.2-1.5 GeV.
- Bottom quark (b): ~4.1-4.7 GeV.
- Top quark (t): way too heavy, ~173 GeV. So 6 GeV is less than 2mt, so top is out.
- Electron (e): ~0.0005 GeV.
- Muon (μ): ~0.105 GeV.
- Tau (τ): ~1.777 GeV.
- Neutrinos are super light, but I think in this problem, maybe they're not considered since the interaction term doesn't involve neutrinos. Or does it? Wait, the problem mentions fermions, but the interaction is written as ψ_f, which I think refers to charged fermions, not neutrinos.

Wait, looking back at the Lagrangian: L(y) = -λ f ψ_f (ῡ + X) ψ_f. Wait, this seems a bit ambiguous. Maybe it's supposed to be something like λ ψ_f^† (ῡ + X) ψ_f. Alternatively, perhaps the interaction term is λ ψ_f ψ_f X. No, wait, I think it might be a Yukawa coupling term. Like, the standard Yukawa interaction is L = -g ψ ψ X, which would be a term like g \bar{ψ} ψ X, meaning X couples to two fermions.

So, for X to decay into a fermion-antifermion pair, the fermion mass must be less than M_X/2. So M_X is 6 GeV, so each fermion's mass must be less than 3 GeV. Let me check the masses again:

- up, down, strange, charm, bottom, etc. So:

u: ~2 MeV → 2m_u = 4 MeV < 6 GeV → allowed.
d: ~5 MeV → 2m_d ~10 MeV < 6 GeV → allowed.
s: ~100 MeV → 200 MeV < 6 GeV → allowed.
c: ~1.5 GeV → 3 GeV. Oh, wait, M_X is 6 GeV. 2m_c would be 3 GeV, which is less than 6 GeV. So c is allowed.

b quark: 4.5 GeV. 2m_b is about 9 GeV. But wait, 6 GeV is less than 9 GeV. So 2m_b = ~9 GeV is bigger than M_X =6 GeV. So b quark is too heavy, so X can't decay into b bbar. Wait, is that right? Because 4.5 GeV is each, so 2*4.5 is 9, which is bigger than 6. So M_X=6 GeV < 9 GeV → decay into b bbar is forbidden.

Similarly for top quark: way too heavy, as 2m_t is 346 GeV, which is way larger than 6 GeV. So top is out.

So the fermions that are allowed are u, d, s, c, and the charged leptons e, μ, τ.

Wait, what about the tau? Tau is about 1.77 GeV. 2m_tau is about 3.54 GeV, which is less than 6 GeV. So tau is allowed. But the electron and muon: their masses are negligible, so 2m_e and 2m_muon are way below 6 GeV. So all these leptons are allowed.

Wait, but the interaction term in the Lagrangian: does it involve only certain fermions? The problem states that the interaction is with fermions ψ_f, but I don't see any restriction on which fermions. So the decay depends only on the mass.

So the possible decay products are the fermion pairs where 2m_f < 6 GeV. That includes u, d, s, c, e, mu, tau. But not b or t.

Looking at the options:

Option A: X → b bbar, s sbar, u u bar, d dbar, tau+ tau-, e+ e-.

But wait, as I concluded, X can't decay into b bbar. So Option A is incorrect.

Option B: X → c cbar, s sbar, u u bar, d dbar, tau+ tau-, mu+ mu-, e+ e-.

But why is c included? 2m_c is 3 GeV, which is less than 6. So c is allowed. But wait, 6 GeV is the mass of X. So the decay into c cbar is allowed because 2m_c = 3 GeV < 6 GeV. So option B includes c.

Wait, but I thought earlier that in option B, the fermions included are c, s, u, d, tau, mu, e. So all these are allowed.

Option C: Includes t, which is impossible. So no.

Option D: Includes b and tau, mu, e. But b is too heavy, so decay into b is forbidden. So D is incorrect.

Option B is the correct one, because it includes c, s, u, d, tau, mu, e.

Wait, but looking back, option B includes c, which is allowed. So why is option B correct?

So the allowed decays are:

c cbar (since 2m_c = 3 GeV <6 GeV), s sbar (2m_s = 0.2 GeV), u u bar, d dbar, tau+ tau- (2m_tau=3.54 GeV <6 GeV), mu+ mu- (2m_mu=0.21 GeV), e+ e-.

So the allowed fermions are c, s, u, d, tau, mu, e.

Looking at the options:

Option B: X→c cbar, s sbar, u u bar, d dbar, tau, mu, e.

Option D includes b, which is not allowed.

Option A includes b, which is wrong.

So the correct answer is option B.


To determine the kinematically allowed decays of the boson \( X \) with a mass of \( 6 \, \text{GeV} \), we analyze the interaction term in the Lagrangian:

\[
\mathcal{L}(y) = -\lambda f \bar{\psi}_f (\upsilon + X(y)) \psi_f(y),
\]

which indicates that \( X \) couples to fermions. For a boson to decay into a fermion-antifermion pair (\( f \bar{f} \)), the mass of the boson (\( M_X \)) must satisfy \( M_X \geq 2m_f \), where \( m_f \) is the mass of the fermion.

### Fermion Masses and Decay Allowance
The masses of the relevant fermions are approximately:
- \( m_u \sim 1-2 \, \text{MeV} \), \( m_d \sim 3-5 \, \text{MeV} \), \( m_s \sim 95-105 \, \text{MeV} \),
- \( m_c \sim 1.2-1.5 \, \text{GeV} \), \( m_b \sim 4.1-4.7 \, \text{GeV} \),
- \( m_\tau \sim 1.777 \, \text{GeV} \), \( m_\mu \sim 0.105 \, \text{GeV} \), \( m_e \sim 0.0005 \, \text{GeV} \).

For \( M_X = 6 \, \text{GeV} \), the condition \( M_X \geq 2m_f \) is satisfied for:
- \( u, d, s, c, \tau, \mu, e \), as \( 2m_f \) for these fermions is less than \( 6 \, \text{GeV} \).
- \( b \) and \( t \) quarks are excluded because \( 2m_b \sim 8.2 \, \text{GeV} \) and \( 2m_t \sim 346 \, \text{GeV} \), both greater than \( 6 \, \text{GeV} \).

### Analysis of Options
- **Option A**: Includes \( b \bar{b} \), which is forbidden since \( 2m_b > M_X \). Incorrect.
- **Option B**: Includes \( c \bar{c}, s \bar{s}, u \bar{u}, d \bar{d}, \tau^+ \tau^-, \mu^+ \mu^-, e^+ e^- \), all of which satisfy \( 2m_f < M_X \). Correct.
- **Option C**: Includes \( t \bar{t} \), which is forbidden since \( 2m_t \gg M_X \). Incorrect.
- **Option D**: Includes \( b \bar{b} \), which is forbidden. Incorrect.

### Conclusion
The kinematically allowed decays of \( X \) are \( X \rightarrow c \bar{c}, s \bar{s}, u \bar{u}, d \bar{d}, \tau^+ \tau^-, \mu^+ \mu^-, e^+ e^- \), as listed in **Option B**.
