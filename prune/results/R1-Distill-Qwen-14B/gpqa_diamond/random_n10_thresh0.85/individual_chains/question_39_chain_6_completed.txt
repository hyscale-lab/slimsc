Okay, I've got a quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, so I need to think carefully. Let me try to break it down step by step.

So the problem says we have 10,000 identical systems, each with a particle moving along a tube (x-axis). The wave function is given as (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i. And when they measured the particles, none were found at x < 1 or x > 3. So the particles are only found between x=1 and x=3.

Wait, that means the wave function must be zero outside this region because the probability of finding the particle there is zero. Oh, right, the wave function squared gives the probability density. So for x <1 and x>3, the wave function is zero.

But the given wave function is (a/sqrt(1+x)) -0.5i. Hmm, so that suggests that the wave function has both real and imaginary parts. But wait, in quantum mechanics, the wave functions are usually complex, but the square of the absolute value (the modulus squared) gives the probability density.

Wait, but for the wave function to be zero outside x=1 to x=3, the expression (a/sqrt(1+x)) -0.5i must be zero for x outside this interval. But that doesn't make sense because the square root of (1+x) would be real only when 1+x is positive, so x > -1. But the measurements are only between 1 and 3. Hmm, maybe I'm misunderstanding.

Wait, perhaps the wave function is given in a specific part of space. The problem says, "in a part of space where it can exist." So maybe the wave function is only non-zero between x=1 and x=3, and zero elsewhere.

Wait, but the wave function given is (a/sqrt(1+x)) -0.5i. That seems to have a real part (a/sqrt(1+x)) and an imaginary part (-0.5i). So the modulus squared would be [a^2/(1+x)] + (0.5)^2. Because when you square the absolute value, (a/sqrt(1+x) + (-0.5i)) would be |psi|^2 = (a/sqrt(1+x))^2 + (0.5)^2.

But wait, for the wave function to satisfy the condition that the particle is found only between x=1 and x=3, the modulus squared should be zero outside that interval. So for x <1 or x>3, the wave function must be zero.

Wait, but our wave function is non-zero for all x where 1+x is positive, because sqrt(1+x) is real. Wait, when x is less than 1, but greater than -1, the sqrt is real, but maybe the wave function is zero outside x=1 to x=3. So perhaps the wave function is given in a way that it's zero for x <1 and x>3, and non-zero in between. Therefore, the given wave function is only valid between x=1 and x=3, and zero elsewhere.

Alternatively, perhaps the wave function is written in a way that it's zero outside 1 and 3. So maybe the wave function is a product of a function that's non-zero only between 1 and 3, and zero otherwise. But the given expression is (a/sqrt(1+x)) -0.5i. Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating.

Wait, the problem says the wave function is described as that in the part of space where the particle can exist. So in the region x between 1 and 3, the wave function is (a/sqrt(1+x)) -0.5i. But outside of that, it's zero. So for x <1 and x>3, the wave function is zero.

But then, the wave function needs to be normalized, right? Because the total probability over all space must be 1.

So the normalization condition is the integral of |psi(x)|^2 dx from -infinity to infinity equals 1. But since psi is zero outside x=1 and x=3, the integral becomes from x=1 to x=3.

So |psi(x)|^2 is [ (a / sqrt(1+x) )^2 + (0.5)^2 ] because the modulus squared of a complex number a + ib is a² + b².

So the integral from 1 to 3 of [a²/(1+x) + 0.25 ] dx = 1.

Let me compute this integral in terms of a and set it equal to 1.

The integral of a²/(1+x) dx from 1 to 3 is a² * ln(1+x) evaluated from 1 to 3.

So a² [ ln(4) - ln(2) ] = a² ln(2).

Then the integral of 0.25 dx from 1 to 3 is 0.25*(3-1) = 0.5.

So the total integral is a² ln(2) + 0.5 = 1.

So a² ln(2) = 1 - 0.5 = 0.5.

So a² = 0.5 / ln(2).

Compute ln(2), which is approximately 0.6931.

So 0.5 / 0.6931 ≈ 0.7213.

So a is square root of 0.7213, which is around 0.849, approximately 0.85.

Looking at the options, option B is 0.85. So the answer should be B.


To determine the value of \( a \), we start by noting that the wave function is given as \( \psi(x) = \frac{a}{\sqrt{1+x}} - 0.5i \) in the region \( x \in [1, 3] \), and it is zero outside this interval. The probability density is proportional to the modulus squared of the wave function, \( |\psi(x)|^2 = \left(\frac{a}{\sqrt{1+x}}\right)^2 + (0.5)^2 \).

The normalization condition requires that the total probability over all space equals 1. Since the wave function is zero outside \( x \in [1, 3] \), the integral of \( |\psi(x)|^2 \) from \( x = 1 \) to \( x = 3 \) must equal 1:

\[
\int_1^3 \left(\frac{a^2}{1+x} + 0.25\right) dx = 1.
\]

This integral can be split into two parts:
1. \( \int_1^3 \frac{a^2}{1+x} dx \), which evaluates to \( a^2 \ln(1+x) \) evaluated from \( x = 1 \) to \( x = 3 \). This gives \( a^2 \ln(4) - a^2 \ln(2) = a^2 \ln(2) \).
2. \( \int_1^3 0.25 dx \), which evaluates to \( 0.25 \times (3 - 1) = 0.5 \).

Adding these results, the normalization condition becomes:
\[
a^2 \ln(2) + 0.5 = 1.
\]

Solving for \( a^2 \):
\[
a^2 \ln(2) = 0.5 \quad \Rightarrow \quad a^2 = \frac{0.5}{\ln(2)}.
\]

Using \( \ln(2) \approx 0.6931 \), we find:
\[
a^2 \approx \frac{0.5}{0.6931} \approx 0.7213 \quad \Rightarrow \quad a \approx \sqrt{0.7213} \approx 0.85.
\]

Thus, the value of \( a \) is approximately \( 0.85 \), which corresponds to option **B**.

Answer: B
