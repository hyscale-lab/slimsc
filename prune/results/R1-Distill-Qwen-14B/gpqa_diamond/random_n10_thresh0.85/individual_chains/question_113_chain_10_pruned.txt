Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me start by reading the question carefully and jotting down what I know.

The question is about identifying an unknown compound using various spectroscopy techniques: FTIR, 1H NMR, and Mass Spectrometry. The options given are different chemical formulas, so I need to match the spectral data to one of them.

Let's break down the data provided.

First, the FTIR spectrum shows a very broad absorption around 3000 cm^-1. Broad peaks around there usually indicate O-H stretching, like in alcohols or maybe carboxylic acids. But wait, a broad peak could also be from an alcohol's -OH group, or maybe an aromatic ring with O-H like in phenols. Hmm, but wait, I remember that carboxylic acids have very broad O-H stretches because they're more acidic and can form hydrogen bonds more easily. Also, if it's a broad peak, maybe it's an alcohol or maybe something else like an amide, but since the options don't have nitrogen, probably not. So, I'll tentatively note that the compound has an O-H group.

Then, there are two strong absorption peaks at 1700 and 1650 cm^-1. The 1700 region is typical for carbonyl groups, like ketones, aldehydes, esters, or maybe carboxylic acids. The 1650 could be another carbonyl, or maybe an aromatic ring with conjugation. Wait, wait, another possibility is that 1650 is a conjugated carbonyl, like in an alpha, beta-unsaturated carbonyl system. Or maybe it's an amide, but again, options don't have N. Alternatively, 1650 could be a C=C stretch. Wait, but the NMR says there are vinyl hydrogens, so that's a double bond somewhere.

So, FTIR suggests two carbonyl groups? Or maybe one carbonyl and another group like an aromatic ring. Hmm.

Wait, let me think. 1700 is a strong peak, probably a carbonyl. 1650 could be an aromatic ring. Because aromatic C=C stretches are usually around 1450-1600 cm^-1. Wait, 1650 is a bit on the higher side for aromatic C=C
