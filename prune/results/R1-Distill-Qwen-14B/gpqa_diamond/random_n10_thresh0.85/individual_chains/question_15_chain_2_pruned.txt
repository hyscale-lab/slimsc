Okay, so I've been given this question about exoplanet transits and which planet is more likely to transit from our point of view. I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think through it step by step.

First, the setup: two Earth-like planets, Planet_1 and Planet_2. They've been detected via the radial velocity (RV) method. So we know their minimum masses and orbital periods. Both have the same mass. But Planet_1's orbital period is three times shorter than Planet_2's. Also, both have circular orbits. The host stars have the same radii, even though Planet_1's star is twice as massive as Planet_2's. Wait, same radii but different masses? That's interesting because more massive stars are usually bigger, but maybe Planet_2's host is slightly evolved, so perhaps it's a subgiant or something, having expanded a bit but not too much.

The question is about transit probability. The researchers have limited time and want to observe the planet with the higher chance of transiting. So transit probability depends on the alignment of the planet's orbit with our line of sight. The probability is roughly (R_star + R_planet) / a_planet, where a_planet is the semi-major axis. But wait, for Earth-sized planets and stars, the planet's radius is negligible compared to the star's, so it's approximately R_star / a_planet.

Wait, but the star's radius is the same for both, right? Because the question states both host stars have the same radii. So R1 = R2 = R.

So the probability for each planet is proportional to (R / a). But wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me think again. The transit probability is the chance that the planet's orbital plane is aligned such that it passes in front of the star from our perspective. The formula for the probability is (R_star + R_planet)/a, but since R_planet is much smaller than R_star, it's approximately R_star / a. So higher 'a' (semi-major axis) would mean lower probability, because the planet is further out, so a smaller angle—so lower chance of blocking the star.

But wait, wait. The other factor is the orbital period. Because the period (P) is related to the semi-major axis via Kepler's third law. Since both planets orbit their respective stars, and the stars have different masses.

Kepler's third law is P² = (4π²/G(M)) a³, right? So for each planet, a³ = (G*M * P²)/(4π²). But since the two stars have different masses, the semi-major axes will be different.

Wait, the orbital period of Planet_1 is three times shorter than Planet_2's. So P1 = P2 / 3.

M1 is twice M2. Wait, M1 is the mass of the host star for Planet_1, M2 for Planet_2. So M1 = 2 M2.

We can express a for each planet in terms of their periods and the masses.

So for Planet_1: a1^3 = (G * M1 * P1²) / (4π²)
Similarly, for Planet_2: a2^3 = (G * M2 * P2²) / (4π²)

Wait, but since M1 = 2 M2
