Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the decay of a boson. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my particle physics, but I'll try to think it through step by step.

The question gives me the Lagrangian interaction term for a bosonic field X and some fermions. The Lagrangian is written as L(y) = -λ f ψ_f (y) (υ + X(y)) ψ_f(y). Wait, maybe I should parse that more carefully. Oh, right, it's probably something like the Yukawa coupling term. So the interaction is between the boson X and fermions.

The mass of the boson X is 6 GeV, and the question is about the kinematically allowed decays at the lowest order. So I need to figure out which fermions the X boson can decay into, considering their masses.

I remember that for a boson to decay into a pair of fermions, the mass of the boson must be at least twice the mass of each fermion. Because each fermion will carry away some energy, and at minimum, each would be at rest. So the condition is M_X >= 2m_fermion.

So I need to list all the possible fermions that have masses less than or equal to 3 GeV (since 6 GeV is the mass of X, so 6/2 =3 GeV).

Wait, but what are the masses of the known fermions? Let me think:

- Electron (e-): about 0.0005 GeV.
- Muon (μ-): around 0.1 GeV.
- Tau (τ-): about 1.77 GeV.
- Quarks: up (u), down (d) are light, like a few MeV. But the heavier quarks are:
   - Strange (s): around 100 MeV (0.1 GeV)
   - Charm (c): ~1.5 GeV
   - Bottom (b): ~4.5 GeV
   - Top (t): way too heavy, like 173 GeV.

Wait, so let me list the fermions and their masses:

- e-, e+: ~0.0005 GeV each.
- μ-, μ+: ~0.1 GeV.
- τ-, τ+: ~1.77 GeV each.
- u, u-bar: ~2-5 MeV (so 0.002-0.005 GeV)
- d, d-bar: ~3-7 MeV
- s, s-bar: ~95-100 MeV (~0.095-0.1 GeV)
- c, c-bar: ~1.27-1.5 GeV each.
- b, b-bar: ~4.1-4.5 GeV each.
- t, t-bar: way too heavy, 173 GeV each.

So X is 6 GeV. So what fermions can X decay into?

Each fermion pair must have a total mass less than or equal to 6 GeV. So for a pair, each fermion must have mass m where 2m ≤6 GeV → m ≤3 GeV.

Wait, but the fermions come in pairs, like X → f f-bar, right? So each fermion in the pair must have mass less than or equal to 3 GeV.

So let's see which fermions have mass ≤3 GeV:

- e, μ, τ: τ is 1.77 GeV, so each is below 3 GeV.
- u, d, s: all their masses are way below 3 GeV.
- c: about 1.5 GeV, so 2*1.5=3 GeV. So yes, 3 GeV exactly. So X can decay into c c-bar.
- b: 4.5 GeV, so 2*4.5=9 GeV. X is only 6 GeV, so that's not allowed. So X can't decay into b b-bar.
- t: way too heavy. So no.

So possible fermions are:

- e, μ, τ, u, d, s, c.

Wait, but wait. X can decay into any of these fermion pairs where each is less than or equal to 3 GeV.

So the possible decay channels would be:

X → e+ e-
X → μ+ μ-
X → τ+ τ- (since τ is about 1.77 GeV, so each is under 3 GeV)
X → u u-bar
X → d d-bar
X → s s-bar
X → c c-bar

Wait, but wait! What about the quarks? Because in the Standard Model, quarks can't be produced as free particles. So in terms of decay products, can a boson decay into quark-antiquark pairs?

Well, in the context of this problem, the Lagrangian given involves the interaction between X and the fermions. The term is ψ_f (y) (v + X(y)) ψ_f(y), which suggests that X couples directly to fermions. So for the decay X → f f-bar to be allowed, the fermion f must be such that the coupling exists.

Wait, the given Lagrangian is L = -λ f ψ_f (y) (v + X) ψ_f(y). So the coupling is between X and the fermion ψ_f. So, the interaction term is something like X ψ ψ, meaning that X can decay into ψ and ψ-bar. So for each fermion ψ present in the interaction, X can decay into ψ and ψ-bar.

But wait, in the Standard Model, the Yukawa interaction couples the Higgs (v + X here?) to fermions. So the fermions that X can decay into are those that are charged under the interaction, i.e., the ones that the X couples to.

So which fermions are included in the coupling? The problem statement says the interaction is given by that Lagrangian, so presumably, ψ_f represents all the fermions that are included. The problem doesn't specify which fermions are present, but in the multiple-choice options, the possible decay channels include various quarks and leptons.

Wait, but I don't think the problem says which fermions are involved; the options list several possibilities. So perhaps the problem is assuming that the X couples to all the fermions, and we just have to consider their masses.

Wait, but the actual problem is about kinematical allowance, regardless of whether the coupling exists. Hmm, but no, because the coupling determines whether the decay is possible. For example, if the X doesn't couple to taus, then decay into tau pairs is not possible, regardless of mass.

Wait, but in the problem statement, the question is about the kinematically allowed decays, assuming the interaction exists for the fermions. Because the Lagrangian includes the interaction terms for the fermions, so X can couple to all of them. So the question is purely about the mass condition.

Wait, no. Because the problem's Lagrangian is given as L(y) = -λ f ψ_f (y) (v + X(y)) ψ_f(y). So I think this is a Yukawa coupling term, which typically couples to each fermion. So the fermions that can be decay products are those that are charged under this coupling.

But the problem doesn't specify which fermions ψ_f are present. So perhaps the problem is assuming that X couples to all the fermions, and we just have to determine which can be kinematically allowed.

Wait, but given the options, the possible decay products include quarks and leptons. So perhaps, for this problem, the X can decay into any fermion pair where the fermion's mass is less than or equal to 3 GeV.

So the possible fermions are:

- e, u, d, s, c, mu, tau, and their antiparticles.

Wait, but the top quark is way too heavy, so it's excluded.

So now, looking at the options:

Option A: X → b b-bar, s s-bar, u u-bar, d d-bar, tau+ tau-, e+ e-.

Wait, but b has a mass of about 4.5 GeV, 2*m is 9 GeV, which is more than X's 6 GeV, so that decay is kinematically forbidden. So option A includes b b-bar, which is not allowed. So A is incorrect.

Option B: X → c c-bar, s s-bar, u u-bar, d d-bar, tau+ tau-, mu+ mu-, e+ e-.

c has a mass of about 1.5 GeV, so 2*1.5=3 GeV, which is okay because X is 6 GeV. So c c-bar is allowed.

Tau is allowed because 2*1.77=3.54 GeV <6 GeV.

So option B includes c, which is allowed, and excludes b. So B is a possible option.

Option C: includes c, s, u, d, t, tau. Oh, but t is way too heavy. So option C is wrong because it includes t t-bar, which is impossible.

Option D: includes b, which is not allowed. So D is incorrect.

Wait, let me recheck the options:

Looking back.

Option A: includes b, which is 4.5 GeV each. 2*4.5=9 GeV>6 GeV → not allowed. So A is wrong.

Option B: does it include c, which is allowed. Let me see:

X can decay into (c c-bar, s s-bar, u u-bar, d d-bar, tau+ tau-, mu+ mu-, e+ e-). So all these have 2m_f ≤6 GeV. Yes.

Wait, what about tau? 2 * 1.77 is about 3.54 GeV, which is less than 6 GeV. So allowed.

So option B includes all possible fermions with mass <=3 GeV.

Wait, but wait. What about the bottom quark? It's 4.5 GeV, so 2*4.5=9 GeV, which is more than 6 GeV. So X can't decay into bottom quarks.

So the correct decay options are all fermions with mass less than or equal to 3 GeV. So which fermions are these?

Looking at each:

Electron: yes.

Muon: yes.

Tau: yes.

Up quark: yes.

Down quark: yes.

Strange quark: yes.

Charm quark: yes.

Bottom quark: no.

Top quark: no.

So, decay channels allowed are e, mu, tau, u, d, s, c.

So the decay products would include all these fermions in pairs.

Looking back at the options, option B lists c, s, u, d, tau, mu, e. So that's all except the bottom.

So option B is the correct one.

Wait, but what about the X's coupling to the fermions? Because maybe the X doesn't couple to some of these fermions.

The problem states that the interaction is given by the Lagrangian, which includes ψ_f. So ψ_f represents all the fermions that have this interaction. So if the fermions are part of the interaction, then the decay is possible.

But the problem doesn't specify which fermions are included. So perhaps it's assumed that the X couples to all the fermions, and the only condition is the mass.

So in that case, the correct decay options are all except those where the fermion's mass is above 3 GeV.

So the correct answer would be option B.


The problem involves determining the kinematically allowed decays of a boson \( X \) with a mass of 6 GeV, based on the interaction given by the Lagrangian:

\[
\mathcal{L}(y) = -\lambda f \bar{\psi}_f(y) (\upsilon + X(y)) \psi_f(y).
\]

The kinematic condition for a boson to decay into a pair of fermions \( f \bar{f} \) is that the boson's mass must be at least twice the mass of the fermion, i.e., \( M_X \geq 2m_f \). This ensures that the fermions can be produced with the available energy.

### Fermion Masses and Decay Channels
The masses of the fermions in the Standard Model are approximately:
- \( m_e, m_{\mu}, m_{\tau} \): \( \sim 0.0005 \, \text{GeV}, \, 0.1 \, \text{GeV}, \, 1.77 \, \text{GeV} \),
- \( m_u, m_d, m_s \): \( \sim 2-5 \, \text{MeV}, \, 3-7 \, \text{MeV}, \, 95-100 \, \text{MeV} \),
- \( m_c \): \( \sim 1.5 \, \text{GeV} \),
- \( m_b \): \( \sim 4.5 \, \text{GeV} \),
- \( m_t \): \( \sim 173 \, \text{GeV} \).

For \( X \) with \( M_X = 6 \, \text{GeV} \), the condition \( M_X \geq 2m_f \) implies \( m_f \leq 3 \, \text{GeV} \). This allows decays into the following fermion pairs:
- \( e^+ e^- \),
- \( \mu^+ \mu^- \),
- \( \tau^+ \tau^- \),
- \( u \bar{u} \),
- \( d \bar{d} \),
- \( s \bar{s} \),
- \( c \bar{c} \).

The decays into \( b \bar{b} \) and \( t \bar{t} \) are kinematically forbidden because \( 2m_b = 9 \, \text{GeV} > 6 \, \text{GeV} \) and \( 2m_t = 346 \, \text{GeV} > 6 \, \text{GeV} \).

### Analysis of Options
- **Option A**: Includes \( b \bar{b} \), which is kinematically forbidden. **Incorrect**.
- **Option B**: Includes \( c \bar{c} \), \( s \bar{s} \), \( u \bar{u} \), \( d \bar{d} \), \( \tau^+ \tau^- \), \( \mu^+ \mu^- \), and \( e^+ e^- \), all of which satisfy \( m_f \leq 3 \, \text{GeV} \). **Correct**.
- **Option C**: Includes \( t \bar{t} \), which is kinematically forbidden. **Incorrect**.
- **Option D**: Includes \( b \bar{b} \), which is kinematically forbidden. **Incorrect**.

### Conclusion
The only kinematically allowed decay channels for \( X \) are those listed in **Option B**.

Answer: B
