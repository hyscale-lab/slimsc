Okay, so I've got this problem about a rhombohedral crystal. Hmm, I remember that rhombohedral crystals have all sides equal, but the angles can be different. But wait, in this case, the angles alpha, beta, and gamma are all 30 degrees. So the unit cell is a rhombohedron with all angles equal to 30 degrees.

The interatomic distance is given as 10 Angstroms. Wait, interatomic distance is the distance between adjacent atoms, right? So that's the edge length of the unit cell, a. Because in a cubic structure, the edge length is the interatomic distance, but here it's rhombohedral. So a = 10 A.

The question is about the interplanar distance for the (111) plane. Interplanar distance is the distance between adjacent planes in the crystal lattice. I think this is calculated using the formula from X-ray diffraction, the Bragg's law, but more specifically, the interplanar spacing formula.

The formula for interplanar distance d_hkl is given by d = a / sqrt( (h^2 + k^2 + l^2) + 2(hk + hl + kl) * cos(theta) ) ), but wait, no—that's not quite right. Oh wait, I'm mixing up the formulas. Let me think again.

The correct formula for the interplanar distance in a rhombohedral crystal is d = a / sqrt( (h² + k² + l²) + 2(hk + hl + kl) cos ρ ), where ρ is the angle between the lattice vectors. But wait, in a rhombohedral system, all angles are equal to ρ. So
