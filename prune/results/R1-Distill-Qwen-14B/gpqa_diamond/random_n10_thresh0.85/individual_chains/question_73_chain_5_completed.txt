Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question is. Hmm, it's about two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds and finding the relative speed and the total energy of the system.

Alright, the problem states that two astronauts have masses 2m and 3m, moving at 0.6c and 0.5c respectively in the positive x-direction. I need to find the relative speed between them and the total energy of the system. 

Wait, wait. Relative speed in relativity isn't just a simple subtraction like in classical mechanics. I remember that when objects are moving at significant fractions of the speed of light, you have to use the relativistic velocity addition formula. Oh right, the formula is (v1 - v2)/(1 - (v1v2)/(c²)) ). Or wait, is it (v2 - v1) over something else? Wait, no, wait: when calculating the relative speed of object A as seen from object B, if A is moving at v and B at u, then the relative speed of A with respect to B is (v - u)/(1 - (vu)/(c²)).

Wait, but in this case, both are moving in the same direction. So the relative speed of the second astronaut as seen from the first would be (0.6c - 0.5c)/(1 + (0.6c * 0.5c)/(c²)) )? Wait, no, wait. Let me think.

Wait, the general formula for relative velocity in relativity is (u - v)/(1 - (uv)/(c²)), where u is the velocity of the first object in the rest frame, and v is the velocity of the second. Wait, wait, no, maybe I'm mixing up the terms. Let me clarify.

Suppose in the lab frame, astronaut A is moving at v = 0.6c, and astronaut B is moving at u = 0.5c, both in the positive x-direction. So, to find the speed of B as seen from A's frame, which is moving at 0.6c relative to the lab. Hmm, so from A's perspective, what is the velocity of B?

Wait, perhaps it's better to think in terms of velocity transformations. The Lorentz transformation for velocity when switching frames. The formula is:

u' = (u - v) / (1 - (u v)/(c²))

So in this case, from A's frame (moving at v=0.6c relative to lab), the speed of B (which is moving at u=0.5c in the lab) would be u' = (0.5c - 0.6c)/(1 - (0.5c * 0.6c)/(c²)).

Let me compute that. Numerator is -0.1c. Denominator is 1 - (0.3 c²)/(c²) )= 1 - 0.3 = 0.7.

So u' is (-0.1c)/0.7 ≈ -0.1428c. The negative sign indicates that from A's perspective, B is moving in the opposite direction. But since the question asks for the relative speed, which is a magnitude, so 0.1428c, which is approximately 0.14c. So that's one of the options. Looking at the options, C and D have 0.14c. So that's for the relative speed.

Now, the second part is the total energy of the system. Hmm, the total energy in the center-of-momentum frame? Or the lab frame? Wait, the problem says "the total energy of the system." Well, in relativity, when dealing with multiple objects, the total energy is the sum of their relativistic energies in the same frame.

Wait, but the problem doesn't specify the frame, but since the question is about the system's energy, I think it's referring to the rest frame where the total momentum is zero, which is the center-of-momentum frame. Alternatively, perhaps it's referring to the lab frame, but I'm not sure. Wait, let's read the question again.

The question says: "What will be the relative speed and the total energy of the system?" So I think it's asking for the total energy in the lab frame, because that's the frame where both astronauts are moving. Alternatively, maybe the rest frame, but I'm not certain. Hmm.

Wait, let's compute the total energy in the lab frame. Each astronaut's energy is their relativistic energy, so E_total = gamma1 * m1 c² + gamma2 * m2 c².

Wait, wait a second. Let me clarify: the masses given are 2m and 3m. So m1 = 2m, moving at v1=0.6c; m2=3m, moving at v2=0.5c.

So the gamma factors are gamma1 = 1/sqrt(1 - (0.6c)^2 / c²) ) = 1/sqrt(1 - 0.36) = 1/sqrt(0.64) = 1/0.8 = 1.25.

Gamma2 is 1/sqrt(1 - (0.5)^2) = 1/sqrt(0.75) ≈ 1.1547.

So E1 = gamma1 * m1 c² = 1.25 * 2m c² = 2.5 m c².

E2 = gamma2 * m2 c² ≈ 1.1547 * 3m c² ≈ 3.464 m c².

So E_total = 2.5 + 3.464 = 5.964 m c². Which is approximately 5.96 mc². Looking at the options, option C says 5.96 mc^2. Option B also says 4.96, but that doesn't match. So the total energy would be approximately 5.96 mc².

Wait, but wait—is the total energy always in the center-of-momentum frame? Or is it the sum of the energies in the lab frame? Oh, the question just says "total energy of the system." Hmm, in relativity, the total energy depends on the frame. But the problem probably expects the sum in the lab frame. Also, the options have different energies, so it's likely that the correct answer is option C, which has both the relative speed of 0.14c and energy 5.96 mc².

Looking back at the options:

Option C: v_rel=0.14c, E=5.96 mc².

So that would be the correct answer.


To solve the problem, we analyze the relative speed and total energy of the system for two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds.

### Relative Speed
The relative speed of one astronaut as seen from the other is calculated using the relativistic velocity addition formula:

\[
v_{\text{rel}} = \frac{v_1 - v_2}{1 - \frac{v_1 v_2}{c^2}}
\]

Here, \(v_1 = 0.6c\) and \(v_2 = 0.5c\). Substituting these values:

\[
v_{\text{rel}} = \frac{0.6c - 0.5c}{1 - \frac{(0.6c)(0.5c)}{c^2}} = \frac{0.1c}{1 - 0.3} = \frac{0.1c}{0.7} \approx 0.1428c
\]

The relative speed is approximately \(0.14c\), which matches the values in options C and D.

### Total Energy of the System
The total energy of the system is the sum of the relativistic energies of the two astronauts. The relativistic energy of an object is given by:

\[
E = \gamma m c^2, \quad \text{where } \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}}}
\]

For the first astronaut (\(m_1 = 2m\), \(v_1 = 0.6c\)):

\[
\gamma_1 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - (0.6)^2}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.64}} = 1.25
\]
\[
E_1 = \gamma_1 m_1 c^2 = 1.25 \cdot 2m c^2 = 2.5m c^2
\]

For the second astronaut (\(m_2 = 3m\), \(v_2 = 0.5c\)):

\[
\gamma_2 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - (0.5)^2}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.75}} \approx 1.1547
\]
\[
E_2 = \gamma_2 m_2 c^2 \approx 1.1547 \cdot 3m c^2 \approx 3.464m c^2
\]

The total energy of the system is:

\[
E_{\text{total}} = E_1 + E_2 = 2.5m c^2 + 3.464m c^2 \approx 5.964m c^2
\]

This matches the total energy in option C.

### Final Answer
The relative speed is \(0.14c\), and the total energy of the system is approximately \(5.96m c^2\). Comparing with the options, the correct choice is:
