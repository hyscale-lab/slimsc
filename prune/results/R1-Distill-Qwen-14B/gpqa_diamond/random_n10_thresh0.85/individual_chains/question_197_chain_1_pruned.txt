Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question again.

The question says that Compound X reacts with red phosphorus and HI. I need to identify the final product. The options are A, B, C, D, which are various substituted benzene derivatives.

First, let's look at the spectral data given for Compound X. The IR and NMR data can help me figure out the structure of X, which is necessary to determine what happens when it reacts.

Starting with the IR data: The peaks are at 3400–2500 cm-1, which usually indicates O-H or N-H stretches, but given the context, it's more likely an O-H (like a carboxylic acid or maybe an alcohol). Then, 1720 cm-1 is a strong peak, which suggests a carbonyl group. That could be a ketone, aldehyde, ester, or carboxylic acid. The peaks at 1610 and 1450 cm-1 could be aromatic C=C stretching. So maybe there's a benzene ring involved.

Looking at the NMR data. The 1H NMR shows:

- 10.5 ppm (bs, 1H): A broad singlet around 10 ppm. That's a strong indicator of an aldehyde proton, but wait, wait. Carboxylic acids also have protons around 10-12 ppm, but they're usually broad. Wait, or maybe an acidic proton like an -OH in a carboxylic acid. Or maybe an aldehyde proton. Hmm.

Wait, another possibility: the broad peak at 10.5 could be an aldehyde proton. But wait, aldehyde protons are usually around 9-10 ppm, but it's possible. Alternatively, a carboxylic acid would have a broad peak, often split into a broad singlet, but maybe under the conditions, it's a single peak. Alternatively, maybe an exchange broadening for an -OH proton. Hmm.

Wait, but looking at the other peaks. The next is 8.0 ppm (d, 2H), 7.2 ppm (d, 2H). Those look like a para-substituted aromatic system. Like two protons as a doublet each, which would suggest a para-substituted benzene. So maybe there's a substituent on the benzene ring that's para, and it's causing the splitting. So the aromatic protons are in a para arrangement, each as a doublet.

Then, looking at the lower field, the other peaks are at 2.9 ppm (m, 1H), 1.7 ppm (m, 2H), 1.4 ppm (d, 3H), 0.9 ppm (t, 3H). These are probably from an alkyl group attached to something. Let's think about the structure.

Wait, so putting this together: the compound has a benzene ring with substituents that cause the aromatic protons to be in a para arrangement. So perhaps a substituent in the para position, maybe a substituent that's an electron-withdrawing group, considering the carbonyl peak in IR.

Wait, but the IR has a peak at 1720 cm-1. That's a strong carbonyl. So maybe it's a carboxylic acid, which would have a peak around 1700 cm-1. Alternatively, an ester or ketone. But considering the NMR, the 10.5 ppm is a possible aldehyde or carboxylic acid. Let's think: if it's a carboxylic acid, the O-H would show up around 2500-3000 cm-1 as a broad peak, but the IR here includes 3400–2500, which might be O-H. But I've also seen that carbonyl in a carboxylic acid is about 1700. So 1720 is a bit higher, which might suggest an ester or ketone. Hmm.

Wait, but in the NMR, the 10.5 ppm proton—if it's an aldehyde, then the aldehyde proton would be in that region, but then where's the carbonyl? Alternatively, a carboxylic acid would have a carbonyl around 1700 and an O-H around 10 ppm or so, but the O-H would be a broad peak, which is what we're seeing at 10.5. Hmm. Alternatively, the 10.5 could be an -OH, but then in the IR, the 3400–2500 would correspond to O-H stretching. So maybe it's a carboxylic acid.

Wait, wait, but let's think about the NMR again. The 10.5 is a singlet, broad. If it's a carboxylic acid, the -OH proton would be broad, but sometimes they can be hidden or split into a singlet if they're exchanging rapidly. Alternatively, if it's an aldehyde, the H would be a singlet. But aldehydes are typically around 9.5-10 ppm, so 10.5 is a bit high, but possible.

Wait, but what about another possibility: maybe the 10.5 is a vinyl proton. No, that's less likely. Or maybe an aromatic proton with coupling? No, the aromatic protons are at 8 and 7.2, which are in the expected range for a para-substituted benzene.

So perhaps the 10.5 is the aldehyde. Then, the IR at 1720 would be a carbonyl, which would fit an aldehyde (but aldehydes are usually around 2800 for the C-H, but 1720 is the carbonyl). So that's possible.

Alternatively, maybe the 10.5 is a vinylic proton. But I think I'm getting stuck here. Let's look at the rest of the NMR.

The lower field peaks: 2.9 ppm (m, 1H), 1.7 ppm (m, 2H), 1.4 (d, 3H), 0.9 (t, 3H).

Wait, the 0.9 triplet (3H) suggests a methyl group attached to a CH2. Because a triplet with 3H is likely a CH3 adjacent to a CH2. So maybe it's part of an ethyl group, but wait, the peak at 1.4 is a doublet (3H), which suggests maybe a CH(CH3) group. Wait, a doublet for 3H at 1.4 ppm is typical for a methyl group attached to a CH which is next to another CH. So maybe a branching there.

Let me think about the structure. Suppose we have a benzene ring with substituents. Let's say in the para position, there's a substituent that's an -O-CO- group or something else. Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a carbonyl group, like a ketone, attached to an alkyl chain.

Wait, but the IR has 1720, which could be an ester—like an ester carbonyl. Alternatively, a ketone. But if it's a ketone, the carbonyl would be around 1700-1800. 1720 is on the higher side, which could be an ester. Alternatively, maybe an acid chloride, but the IR doesn't show a peak around 1800, so probably not.

Wait
