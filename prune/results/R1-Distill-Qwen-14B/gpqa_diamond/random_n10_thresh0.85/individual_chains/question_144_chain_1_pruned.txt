Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about meson resonance decay. Hmm, let me see. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

The question is asking for the mean decay distance of a meson X. The given parameters are the production energy E_X = 8 GeV, mass m_X = 1.2 GeV, and width Γ_X = 320 MeV. The options are A, B, C, D with some numbers in meters.

Wait, I remember that the mean decay distance (also called the decay length) depends on the lifetime of the particle and its velocity. Oh right, the formula is something like distance = c * τ * β, where c is the speed of light, τ is the proper lifetime, and β is the velocity over the speed of light (v/c).

But how do I find τ? Oh, I think the mean lifetime τ is related to the width Γ through the Heisenberg uncertainty principle. The uncertainty principle says that ΔE * Δt ≈ ħ/2. So, for the width Γ, which is the energy uncertainty in the particle's mass, the lifetime τ is approximately ħ / Γ. But wait, I think Γ is the total decay width, so τ = ħ / Γ.

Wait, no, I'm a bit confused. I think the relation is τ = ħ / Γ, but let me make sure. Because Γ is the width, which is the decay rate times something. Oh right, the decay width Γ is related to the lifetime by Γ = ħ / τ. So τ = ħ / Γ. Yeah, that makes sense.

So first, I need to compute τ. Let me note down the given values:

E_X = 8 GeV (but I'm not sure if E is needed here, maybe for velocity calculation?), m_X = 1.2 GeV, Γ_X = 320 MeV.

Wait, but the production energy E_X is 8 GeV. Hmm, how does that fit in? Because for the decay distance, I think the energy affects the velocity of the meson. Because the decay distance depends on how fast the particle is moving. So I'll probably need to find the velocity β from E_X and m_X.

Wait, but wait a second. The meson's rest mass is 1.2 GeV, and the production energy is 8 GeV. So the meson is moving at relativistic speeds. So I need to find the velocity β from the energy.

The energy E of a relativistic particle is given by E = γ m c
