Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about cobalt complexes and stability constants. Hmm, I remember stability constants are related to the formation of complexes, right? So the higher the beta (β) value, the more stable the complex is.

The question is asking for the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes. Wait, what's the structure of these complexes? Oh right, I think dithiocyanato complexes would have two SCN- ions attached. So the main complexes we're considering are Co(SCN)n^m+ where n is the number of thiocyanate ligands.

Given the problem, the total cobalt concentration is 1e-2 M, and the [SCN-] is 0.1 M. The stability constants are given for β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16. Hmm, wait a second. The stability constants usually follow a pattern where each βn is the formation constant for the nth complex. So β1 is for the first complex, Co(SCN), β2 for Co(SCN)2, and so on.

Wait, but β4 is 16. That seems lower than β3. Usually, the stability constants increase as the number of ligands increases, but maybe in this case, the fourth complex is less stable? Or perhaps the β values are for each step. Oh right, β1 is the constant for the first step, Co²+ + SCN⁻ → Co(SCN)²+. Then β2 is the constant for the second ligand, so the second step would be Co(SCN)²+ + SCN⁻ → Co(SCN)₂²+, and so on. So each β represents the stepwise formation.

But wait, the overall formation constant for the nth complex is the product of β1, β2, ..., βn. So the overall β for Co(SCN)_n is β1*β2*...*βn. Wait no, wait. No, actually, the formation constants are cumulative. So the log β_total for the complex with n ligands is the sum of the logs of each βi up to i=n. So for example, the overall K for Co(SCN)_2²+ is β1 * β2.

But wait, in the problem, the question is about the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato complexes, which I think refers to the [Co(SCN)_2]
