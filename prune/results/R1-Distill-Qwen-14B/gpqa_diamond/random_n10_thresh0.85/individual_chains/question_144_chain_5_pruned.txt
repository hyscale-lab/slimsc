Okay, so I've got this physics problem about a meson resonance and its mean decay distance. Hmm, I've heard about mesons before; they're subatomic particles, right? But I'm a bit rusty on the specifics. Let me think through this step by step.

The question gives me some parameters: production energy E_X is 8 GeV, mass m_X is 1.2 GeV, and width Γ_X is 320 MeV. I need to find the mean decay distance. The options are A to D, all in the order of 10^-15 or 10^-16 meters, which makes sense because particles decay quickly, so the distance should be really small.

Wait, I remember that the mean decay distance is related to the particle's lifetime and its velocity. Oh right, the formula is something like distance = c * τ * beta, where c is the speed of light, τ is the mean lifetime, and beta is the velocity over the speed of light (v/c).

First, I need to find the mean lifetime τ. I think the mean lifetime is connected to the total decay width Γ. The formula I recall is τ = ħ / Γ, where ħ is the reduced Planck constant. Oh wait, but Γ is given in MeV, and ħ is usually in units like eV·s or something. Let me check the units.

Wait, the decay width Γ is related to the lifetime τ by τ = ħ / Γ. But Γ is given in MeV, which is an energy unit. So I need to convert that energy into units compatible with ħ.

Hmm, ħ is approximately 6.582 × 10^-25 GeV·s. Wait, because 1 GeV is 1e9 eV, and ħ is about 6.58e-25 GeV·s. Let me make sure: yes, ħ ≈ 197.33 MeV·fm, but perhaps I should use the value in GeV·s for this calculation.

Given Γ is 320 MeV. Let's convert that to GeV. 320 MeV is 0.32 GeV. So Γ = 0.32 GeV.

So τ = ħ / Γ. Plugging in the numbers: 6.582e-25 GeV·s divided by 0.32 GeV. So 6.582e-25 / 0.32 ≈ 2.0568
