Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm going to try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question says.

The problem talks about a substance X that incorporates a heavier isotope of one of its constituent elements. It reacts violently with liquid Y and releases a gas W. The gas W's molecule has the same number of neutrons and protons. Then, a precipitate G forms, which when heated releases B. B's melting point is close to 277 K. Also, when a certain keto acid reacts with X, the product has two oxygen atoms. X is used as a reagent in organic chemistry, and it's similar to another substance. 

The question is asking for the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements in X. The options are A)35, B)25, C)31, D)29.

Hmm. Let me break this down.

First, let's think about the reaction between X and Y. It's a violent reaction, so maybe it's something like a metal reacting with an acid. When metals react with acids, they often produce hydrogen gas. So, perhaps Y is an acid, and X is a metal.

The gas W has the same number of neutrons and protons. Let's think about the possible gases. Hydrogen gas is H2, which has 1 proton each, so two in total. But wait, if each H has 0 neutrons (since it's protium), then the total neutrons would be 0. So that doesn't match. Alternatively, if W is something like water vapor, but that's a liquid usually. Or maybe it's another gas, like O2? No, O2 has 8 protons each, 8 neutrons each (in the most common isotope), so per molecule: 16 protons and 16 neutrons. Hmm, but that's for each O atom, so O2 would have 32 protons and 32 neutrons. That doesn't match because the problem states that per molecule, the number of protons and neutrons are the same.

Wait, perhaps W is CH4? No, wait, no, because that's a hydrocarbon. Let me think again. What if W is CO2? No, because the molecule would have different numbers. Oh wait, maybe W is H2O. Each molecule has 2 H and one O. H has 1 proton each (and 0 neutrons), O has 8 protons and 8 neutrons. So in H2O, total protons = 2 +8 =10. Neutrons: 0 (from H) +8=8. No, that's not equal. So that's not matching.

Wait, maybe W is NH3? No, that's a gas too, but when we talk about gas released in reactions, probably something like H2, CO2, or maybe something else. Oh wait, the question says the same number of neutrons and protons in the molecule. Let me think: if the molecule has the same number of neutrons and protons, so for each molecule, the sum of protons equals the sum of neutrons.

Let's think of possible gases. Let's consider H2. Each H has 1 proton and 0 neutrons. So H2 has 2 protons and 0 neutrons. Not equal. Next, maybe CO? CO has one C (6 protons, 6 neutrons usually) and one O (8 protons, 8 neutrons). So CO has 14 protons, 14 neutrons. That matches! So gas W could be CO.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe it's CH4. Wait, CH4 has 6 protons (from C) and 4*(1 proton) from H, so 10 protons. Neutrons: C has 6, each H has 0. So total neutrons:6. 10 protons vs 6 neutrons: no match.

Wait, another idea: The gas could be O2. Each O atom has 8 protons and 8 neutrons. O2 has 16 protons and 16 neutrons
