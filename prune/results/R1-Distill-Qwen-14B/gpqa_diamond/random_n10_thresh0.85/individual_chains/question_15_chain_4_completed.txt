Okay, so I've got this question about exoplanet transits and which one is more likely to transit. Hmm, I remember that the transit method involves a planet passing in front of its star from our point of view, causing a dip in brightness. The probability of this happening depends on the size of the planet relative to the star and the alignment of the orbit.

The question says there are two planets, Planet_1 and Planet_2. Both have the same mass. Interesting. Their orbital periods are different—Planet_1's period is three times shorter than Planet_2's. So Planet_1 is closer to its star, right? Because shorter orbital period usually means it's closer in, since it takes less time to orbit.

The host stars: Planet_1's star is twice as massive as Planet_2's. But both stars have the same radius. Wait, that's a bit confusing. I thought more massive stars are bigger, but maybe in this case, Planet_2's host is slightly evolved but same radius. So same size, but different masses.

I remember that the probability of a planet transiting its star is given by the formula P = (R_p / R_s)^2 multiplied by some other factors, but wait, no, wait. Let's think again. The transit probability is actually the ratio of the area of the planet's orbit (as seen from Earth) that causes a transit. Oh wait, no, the probability is (R_p / R_s)^2 multiplied by (a^2/(a^2 - d^2))), where d is the distance between the observer's line of sight and the center of the star's disk. Or maybe I'm mixing up the formulas. Alternatively, I think the geometric probability is given by (R_p + R_s) / a, but that can't be right. Wait, no, I think the correct formula for the transit probability is (R_p / R_s)^2 multiplied by (1 / (1 + (R_star / a)^2))). Wait, maybe not. Alternatively, I've heard that the probability is (R_p / R_s)^2 multiplied by ( (a / (R_s)) ) / (sqrt(a² + (R_s)^2)) ) ), but I'm getting confused here.

Wait, I think the correct geometric probability of a transit is (R_p / R_s)² multiplied by (1 / (sqrt(1 + (R_s/a)^2)})), but I'm not sure. Alternatively, another approach: the transit probability is the area of the planet's disk compared to the star's disk, but adjusted for the orbital distance. Wait, maybe it's (R_p / R_s)^2 multiplied by ( (a) / (sqrt(a² + R_s²)) )^2 ), which simplifies to (R_p² a²) / (R_s² (a² + R_s²))).

Alternatively, I think the probability is (R_p / R_s)^2 multiplied by ( (R_s) / a ), which would be (R_p² R_s) / (a² R_s²) ) = (R_p²)/(a² R_s). Hmm, I'm not confident. Maybe I should look for another approach.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the condition for a transit to occur. A transit happens when the planet's orbital plane is aligned with our line of sight such that it crosses in front of the star. The probability is the ratio of the size of the star's disk to the size of the planet's orbit as projected onto the sky.

So the probability P is approximately (R_p)² / (a² * (R_s / a)^2) ), which is (R_p² a²) / (R_s² a²) ) = (R_p²)/(R_s²). Wait, no, that would be if the orbital plane is edge-on, but more accurately, the probability is ( (R_p + R_s) / (a * sin i) ) ), but sin i is 1 for edge-on orbits. Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating.

Wait, I think the correct formula for the transit probability is (R_p / R_s)^2 multiplied by ( (R_s)/(a) )^2 * (1 + (R_s/a)) ), but that doesn't seem right. Alternatively, I've read that the transit probability is (R_p / R_s)^2 multiplied by ( (a)/(R_s) )^{-2} * something. Hmm, perhaps I should look for another approach.

Wait, let me think about the transit probability formula. Oh right, the transit probability is given by:

P = (R_p / R_s)^2 * ( (R_s / a) )^2 ) * ( (1 + (R_s / a)) / sqrt(1 + (R_s/a)^2) ) )

No, that's not right either. Alternatively, I remember that the transit probability is (R_p / R_s)² multiplied by (1/(sqrt(1 + (R_s/a)^2)) )).

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me think about the geometric probability. The planet must pass in front of the star. The probability is the ratio of the area where the planet can be in front of the star (which is a circle) divided by the total possible area in the sky where the planet could be.

Wait, the formula is:

P = (R_p + R_s) / a * (R_s / a) )

Wait no, that's not correct. Oh, I remember now. The transit probability is the ratio of the area of the circle where a transit can occur to the area of the sphere. But it's more complicated because it's a plane.

Alternatively, the transit probability is approximately (R_p / R_s)^2 * ( R_s / a )^2 * ( something else ). I'm getting stuck.

Wait, maybe I should look for a simpler approach. The transit probability is higher when the planet is closer to its star because the star appears smaller from the planet's perspective. Wait, no, higher probability when the planet is larger or the star is smaller. Wait, but the formula is (R_p / R_s)^2 multiplied by (something involving the orbital distance).

Alternatively, another way: the probability of a transit is the ratio of the area of the star's disk as seen from Earth to the area of the planet's orbit's disk. Wait, but the planet's orbit is much larger, so the probability is small.

Wait, perhaps the formula is P = (R_p + R_s)² / (a² + (R_p + R_s)^2) )? No, that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, I found this formula online before:

The probability of a transit is given by:

P = ( (R_p + R_s) / a )² / ( (R_p + R_s)^2 + a² ) )

Wait, that doesn't seem right.

Wait, let me think of it as the area where the planet can transit. The planet's orbit (as viewed from Earth) is a circle of radius a (distance from Earth to star). The star has radius R_s, and the planet has radius R_p. The planet can transit if it's within a circle of radius R_p around the center of the star, as viewed from Earth. So the area where the planet can be is π(R_p)^2, and the total area where the planet could be is π a². So the probability is (R_p²) / (a²).

Wait, that can't be right because it ignores the star's size. Actually, the transit can only happen if the planet is within the projection of the star's disk. So the area where a transit is possible is π (R_p + R_s)^2, and the total area is π a². So the probability is ( (R_p + R_s)^2 ) / a².

Wait, but that doesn't sound right either. Because if a is much larger than R_s, then the probability would be (R_p/R_s)^2 times something, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, I think the correct formula is P = (R_p / R_s)^2 * ( R_s / a )^2. Because when the star's radius is R_s, and the orbital distance is a, the apparent size of the star is R_s / a.

So the probability that the planet's orbit intersects the star's disk is (R_p / (R_s/a))². Wait, no, that would be (a R_p / R_s ) squared.

Wait, maybe the formula is (R_p / R_s)^2 multiplied by ( (R_s / a)^2 ), because that would account for the area of the star compared to the area of the planet's orbit. Because the star's disk as seen from Earth has a radius of R_s / a. So the planet's disk must fit within that.

So the probability would be (R_p / (R_s/a))^2 = (R_p a / R_s )^2.

Wait, but if the planet's disk is R_p, and the star's apparent radius is R_s / a, then the probability is (R_p / (R_s/a))^2, which is (a R_p / R_s )^2.

But that can't be right because when R_p is very small, the probability is small, which makes sense. But when a is small, the probability is higher. So for a planet close to its star (small a), the probability is higher.

So in this question, Planet_1 has a shorter orbital period, so it's closer to its star. So a_1 is smaller than a_2.

Wait, Kepler's third law: (a^3)/(P^2) = (G(M_s + M_p)) / (4 π²). Since M_p is much smaller than M_s, we can approximate a^3 ∝ M_s * P^2.

So for Planet_1: a_1^3 = (G M_1) * (P_1^2) / (4 π²)

Similarly, a_2^3 = (G M_2) * (P_2^2) / (4 π²)

Given that P_2 = 3 P_1, and M_1 = 2 M_2.

So a_1^3 = G (2 M_2) (P_1^2) / (4 π²)

a_2^3 = G M_2 ( (3 P_1)^2 ) / (4 π² )

Calculate the ratio a_1/a_2:

a_1³ / a_2³ = [ (2 M_2) (P_1²) ) ] / [ M_2 (9 P_1²) ) ]

Simplify numerator and denominator: (2 M2 P1²) / (9 M2 P1²) ) = 2/9

So (a_1/a_2)^3 = 2/9 → a_1/a_2 = (2/9)^(1/3)

Let me compute that. 2/9 is about 0.222. The cube root of 0.222 is roughly 0.6 (since 0.6^3=0.216). So a_1 is about 0.6 times a_2.

So a_1 = 0.6 a_2.

Now, the transit probability for each planet is given by (R_p / R_s)^2 multiplied by (a / R_s)^2? Or wait, earlier I thought it's (R_p a / R_s )^2.

Wait, let me clarify. The transit probability is (R_p / R_s)^2 multiplied by ( (R_s / a) )^2. Because the area of the star's disk as seen from Earth is π (R_s/a)^2, and the area of the planet is π R_p^2. So the probability is (R_p^2) / ( (R_s/a)^2 ) = (a R_p / R_s )^2.

Wait, that would give a higher probability when a is smaller, which makes sense because the planet is closer, so more likely to pass in front from our view.

So P = (a R_p / R_s )^2.

But wait, both planets have the same mass, but their radii might be the same? Or do they have same mass but different sizes? Wait, mass and radius are different for planets. For example, a more massive planet could be larger or smaller, depending on composition. But the question says both have the same masses. However, the transit probability depends on the planet's radius, not its mass. So if both planets have the same radius, then the probability depends solely on a and R_s.

Wait, but the question says both planets have the same mass. But unless told otherwise, we can't assume their radii are the same. So perhaps the radii are different? Hmm, but the question doesn't provide the planet radii. So perhaps the planets have the same radius. Or maybe the question expects us to assume that both have the same radius.

Alternatively, maybe it doesn't matter because the host stars have the same radius. Wait, wait, the host stars have the same radii, but different masses.

Wait, the transit probability is (R_p / R_s)^2 * (a / R_s)^2.

Wait no, that's not right. Wait, the formula we derived earlier is (a R_p / R_s)^2.

So for each planet, P = (a_i R_p_i / R_s_i )^2.

Wait, but in this problem, both planets have the same mass, but we don't know if their radii are the same. Hmm, but the question says "Earth-like" planets. So perhaps they have similar radii, but maybe not exactly the same. But without specific data, I think we can assume R_p1 = R_p2 = R_earth.

Wait, but the problem doesn't provide their radii. So perhaps the probability is only dependent on a and R_s, assuming same R_p for both.

Wait, but the question states that both are Earth-like, so perhaps their radii are similar to Earth. But since they have the same mass, maybe their radii are the same. Or perhaps their densities are same, so same radius.

Assuming that, then R_p1 = R_p2.

So the transit probability for each is proportional to (a_i / R_s_i )^2.

Wait, but wait, the formula was (a R_p / R_s )^2, so for same R_p, it's (a / R_s )^2.

So P ∝ (a/R_s)^2.

So for each planet, calculate (a_i / R_s_i )^2.

Let's compute a_1 / R_s1 and a_2 / R_s2.

But wait, the host stars have the same radius, R_s1 = R_s2 = R_s.

So R_s is same for both.

So a_1 / R_s and a_2 / R_s.

Earlier, we found a_1 ≈ 0.6 a_2.

Wait, let me calculate a_1 and a_2 more accurately.

Given:

M1 = 2 M2

P1 = P2 / 3

So using Kepler's third law:

a^3 = (G M_s P^2) / (4 π²)

So for each planet:

a_1^3 = (G M1 P1^2) / (4 π²) = (G * 2 M2 * (P2/3)^2 ) / (4 π²)

a_2^3 = (G M2 P2^2) / (4 π²)

So a_1^3 / a_2^3 = [ (G 2 M2 (P2²/9) ) ] / [ G M2 P2² ) ] = (2/9) → a_1^3 = (2/9) a_2^3 → a_1 = a_2 * (2/9)^(1/3 )

(2/9) is approximately 0.222, cube root is about 0.606.

So a_1 ≈ 0.606 a_2.

So a_1 / a_2 ≈ 0.606.

So a_1 is 0.606 times a_2.

Now, the transit probability for each is proportional to (a_i / R_s )^2.

Since R_s is the same for both, let's compute (a_1 / R_s)^2 and (a_2 / R_s)^2.

P1/P2 = (a_1^2) / (a_2^2) ) = (a_1/a_2)^2 ≈ (0.606)^2 ≈ 0.367.

So P1 is about 0.367 times P2, meaning P2 is about 2.73 times higher.

Wait, but that's the opposite of what I thought earlier. Because a_1 is smaller, so (a_1/R_s) is smaller. So P1 is lower than P2.

Wait, but that can't be right because Planet_1 is closer, so the probability should be higher. Hmm, something's wrong.

Wait, wait, the formula I thought was P = (a R_p / R_s )^2.

But if a is smaller, then (a R_p / R_s ) is smaller, meaning lower probability. But that can't be right because a planet closer in should have a higher chance of transiting, as the alignment probability is higher?

Wait, maybe I have the formula wrong. Maybe the probability is (R_p / (R_s / a))^2, which would be (a R_p / R_s )^2, as before. So lower a would mean higher a R_p / R_s.

Wait, no, if a is smaller, a R_p is smaller.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula. Let me think again.

The transit probability is the area where the planet can transit, which depends on the solid angle.

The formula for the transit probability is approximately (R_p / R_s)^2 multiplied by ( (R_s) / a )^2 * (1 / sqrt(1 + (R_s/a)^2) ), but I'm not confident.

Alternatively, I think the correct formula for the transit probability is (R_p / R_s)^2 multiplied by ( (R_s/a) )^2 * ( (R_s + a) / a ) ), but I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps a better approach is to consider that the transit probability is given by:

P = ( (R_p + R_s) / a )^2 * ( (R_s) )^2 / ( R_s^2 + a^2 )

Wait, no, I'm getting stuck.

Let me try to find the correct formula.

After some quick research in my mind, I remember that the probability of a transit is given by the formula:

P = (R_p / R_s)^2 * ( (R_s) / a )^2 * (1 / (1 + (R_s/a)^2)) )

Wait, that doesn't make sense. Another source I recall states that the transit probability is approximately:

P = (R_p / R_s)^2 * ( (R_s / a) )^2 * ( (R_s + a) / a )

But I'm not confident. Alternatively, perhaps the correct formula is:

P = (R_p / R_s)^2 * ( (R_s) / a )^2 * (1 + (R_s/a)) ) / sqrt(1 + (R_s/a)^2 )

Hmm, this is getting too complicated, and I’m not making progress. Let me try a different approach.

Another approach: the transit probability is the ratio of the area of the star as seen from Earth and the area of the orbit projected onto the sky.

Wait, the projected area of the star is π (R_s / a)^2.

The projected area of the planet's orbit is π (a)^2, because the planet's orbit is a circle of radius a in the plane of the sky.

So the probability that the planet passes in front of the star is the ratio of the star's area to the orbit's area.

P = (π (R_s / a)^2 ) / (π a^2 ) ) = (R_s^2 / a^4 ) / 1 → P = (R_s / a)^2.

Wait, but that can't be right because if a is the same as R_s, then P would be 1, which is obviously wrong because the planet would almost never transit.

Alternatively, perhaps I have it inverted. The probability is the ratio of the planet's area to the star's area, or vice versa.

Wait, no, that's not right. The planet's area is π R_p^2, the star's area is π R_s^2. But the probability of the planet being in front is the area of the star divided by the area of the orbit. Because the planet can be anywhere in its orbit, which is a circle of radius a. So the probability is (area where transit can occur) / (total area of the orbit).

Area where transit can occur is π R_p^2, and the total orbit area is π a^2. So the probability P is (R_p^2 / a^2) * (R_s^2 / (R_s^2 + a^2 )) ), but I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach: the transit probability is the fraction of the planet's orbit where the planet is in front of the star. This is determined by the size of the star relative to the planet's orbit.

The star's apparent size is R_s / a. The planet's size is R_p.

So the probability is (R_p) / (R_s/a) )² → (a R_p / R_s )².

So P = (a R_p / R_s )².

Assuming same R_p for both planets, then P1 = (a1 R_p / R_s )² and P2 = (a2 R_p / R_s )².

So the ratio P1/P2 = (a1²) / (a2²).

Earlier, we found a1 is about 0.606 a2.

So P1/P2 = (0.606 a2 / a2 )^2 ≈ (0.606)^2 ≈ 0.367 → P1 is about 0.367 times P2, so P2 is about 2.73 times higher.

But wait, planet_1 is closer, so shouldn't it have a higher probability?

Wait, according to this calculation, planet_2 has a higher probability. Because a_2 is larger, so (a_2 R_p / R_s ) is larger, so P2 is higher.

So the researchers would prefer to observe planet_2, which has a higher probability.

Looking at the options:

Option A: Planet_2 is preferred due to ~2.25 higher.

Option B: ~1.5 times higher.

Option D: Planet_1 is preferred with 2.7 times higher.

Wait, but according to my calculation, P2 is about 2.73 times higher than P1. So the probability for Planet_2 is higher.

Thus, the researchers would choose Planet_2, which has a higher probability.

Looking at the options, option A and B are about Planet_2, options C and D about Planet_1.

So in the options, A says 2.25 times higher, B says 1.5 times higher.

Wait, but according to my calculation, the ratio is about 2.73.

Looking at the options, option D says Planet_1 is preferred with 2.7 times higher, which would be incorrect because P2 is higher.

Wait but my earlier calculation says P2 is higher.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the ratio of a1 and a2.

Let me re-calculate a_1 and a_2.

Kepler's law: a^3 proportional to M_s * P^2.

So a^3 = k * M_s * P^2.

So a1^3 = k * M1 * P1^2.

a2^3 = k * M2 * P2^2.

Given that M1 = 2 M2 and P1 = P2 /3.

So a1^3 = k * 2 M2 * (P2/3)^2 = k * 2 M2 * P2^2 /9 = (2/9) * k M2 P2^2.

a2^3 = k * M2 * P2^2.

So a1^3 / a2^3 = (2/9) → a1 = a2 * (2/9)^(1/3).

Compute (2/9)^(1/3).

2/9 ≈ 0.222.

Cube root of 0.222 is approximately 0.606.

So a1 = 0.606 a2.

So a1 / a2 = 0.606.

So transit probabilities:

P1 = (a1 / R_s )^2.

P2 = (a2 / R_s )^2.

So P2 = (a2/R_s)^2.

P1 = (0.606 a2 / R_s )^2 = 0.606^2 * (a2/R_s)^2 = 0.367 * P2.

So P2 is approximately 2.727 times higher than P1.

So the probability of transiting is higher for Planet_2.

So the researchers would prefer to observe Planet_2, which has a higher probability.

Now, looking at the options:

Option A says ~2.25 times higher.

Option B says ~1.5 times higher.

Wait, but according to my calculation, it's approximately 2.7 times higher.

Hmm, none of the options A or B state this. Wait, let me recheck the options.

Options:
A) Planet_2 is preferred due to its ~2.25 times higher probability to transit.

B) ...1.5 times.

C) Planet_1 is preferred ...1.65.

D) Planet_1 is preferred ...2.7 times.

Wait, according to my calculation, Planet_2 is preferred, but none of the options for Planet_2 reach 2.7. Only option D suggests Planet_1 is preferred, which would be incorrect. So perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps the formula is the other way around. Maybe the probability is inversely proportional to (a/R_s)^2.

Wait, that would mean that closer planets have lower probability, which doesn't make sense.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is (R_s / a)^2, making Planet_2's probability lower.

Wait, that can't be right because if a is larger, (R_s / a) is smaller, so (R_s/a)^2 is smaller. So for a closer planet (smaller a), (R_s/a) is larger, so P is  (R_p/R_s)^2 * (R_s/a)^2 → (R_p^2 a^2 ) / (R_s^4). No, that doesn't make sense.

Wait, maybe I got the formula wrong. Suppose the correct formula is (R_p / R_s)^2 multiplied by ( (R_s) / (a) )^2.

Wait, that would give P = (R_p^2 R_s^2 ) / ( R_s^2 a^2 ) )= R_p^2 / a^2.

So P is (R_p/a)^2.

But then, a larger a would mean smaller probability, which aligns with intuition. So Planet_1 has a smaller a, so (R_p/a)^2 would be larger.

But in this case, since a_1 is smaller than a_2, (R_p/a_1) is larger than (R_p/a_2), so P1 is larger than P2.

So which is correct?

Earlier I thought P is proportional to (a/R_s)^2, but I'm getting conflicting results.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct formula is P = (R_p / R_s)^2 * ( R_s / a )^2 → (R_p^2 R_s^2 ) / ( R_s^2 a^2 )= R_p^2 / a^2.

So P is (R_p^2)/(a^2).

So for the same R_p, P is inversely proportional to a^2.

So if a_1 is 0.6 a_2, then a_1^2 is 0.36 a_2^2.

So P1 = (R_p^2) / (0.36 a_2^2 ) = (1/0.36) * ( R_p^2 / a_2^2 ) = 2.778 * P2.

So P1 is about 2.778 times higher than P2.

So Planet_1 has a higher probability.

Wait, that makes more sense. Because if a planet is closer, a is smaller, so (R_p/a) is larger, so the probability is higher.

So with this formula, Planet_1 has a higher transit probability.

So the researchers would prefer Planet_1.

Looking at the options:

Option D says Planet_1 is preferred due to 2.7 times higher.

That matches our calculation.

So why did I get confused earlier?

Because I was using the wrong formula for the transit probability. I was using (a R_p / R_s )^2, which gave P1 lower than P2. But the correct formula is (R_p/a)^2, which for same R_p, closer planets have higher probabilities.

So the correct ratio is (a_2^2)/(a_1^2) → because P is inversely proportional to a².

Wait, no. Let me clarify.

If P = (R_p/a)^2, then for the same R_p, P is inversely proportional to a².

So P1/P2 = (a_2^2)/(a_1^2).

Wait, wait: P1 = (R_p/a_1)^2, P2= (R_p/a_2)^2.

So P1/P2 = (a_2²)/(a_1²).

Since a_1 is 0.606 a_2 → a_1 = 0.606 a_2 → a_2 = a_1 / 0.606 ≈ 1.65 a_1.

So P1/P2 = ( (a_2)^2 ) / (a_1)^2 ) = ( (1.65 a_1)^2 ) / (a_1^2 ) ) = (1.65)^2 ≈ 2.72.

So P1 is about 2.72 times P2.

Wait, no, wait. If a_1 is 0.606 a_2, then a_2 = a_1 / 0.606 ≈ 1.65 a_1.

So a_2 = 1.65 a_1.

So P1 = (R_p / a_1 )^2.

P2 = (R_p / a_2 )^2 = (R_p / (1.65 a_1 ))^2.

So P1/P2 = ( (1/(a_1))^2 ) / ( (1/(1.65 a_1 ))^2 ) ) = (1.65)^2 = 2.72.

So P1 is about 2.72 times higher than P2.

Thus, the probability for Planet_1 is higher. So researchers prefer Planet_1.

Looking at the options:

Option D says Planet_1 is preferred due to ~2.7 times higher probability.

So the correct answer is D.


To determine which planet has the higher probability of transiting, we analyze the transit probability formula. The transit probability \( P \) is proportional to:

\[
P \propto \left(\frac{R_p}{a}\right)^2
\]

where \( R_p \) is the planet's radius and \( a \) is the orbital distance. Since both planets have the same mass and are Earth-like, we assume \( R_p \) is the same for both. Therefore, the probability depends on the orbital distance \( a \), with closer planets (smaller \( a \)) having higher transit probabilities.

### Step 1: Orbital Distance Ratio
Using Kepler's third law, the orbital distance \( a \) is related to the host star's mass \( M_s \) and the orbital period \( P \) by:

\[
a^3 \propto M_s P^2
\]

Given:
- \( M_1 = 2M_2 \) (Planet_1's host star is twice as massive as Planet_2's host star),
- \( P_1 = \frac{P_2}{3} \) (Planet_1's orbital period is three times shorter than Planet_2's),

we calculate the ratio of orbital distances:

\[
\frac{a_1^3}{a_2^3} = \frac{M_1 P_1^2}{M_2 P_2^2} = \frac{2M_2 \left(\frac{P_2}{3}\right)^2}{M_2 P_2^2} = \frac{2}{9}
\]

\[
\frac{a_1}{a_2} = \left(\frac{2}{9}\right)^{1/3} \approx 0.606
\]

Thus, \( a_1 \approx 0.606a_2 \).

### Step 2: Transit Probability Ratio
The transit probability is proportional to \( \left(\frac{R_p}{a}\right)^2 \). Since \( R_p \) is the same for both planets, the ratio of probabilities is:

\[
\frac{P_1}{P_2} = \frac{a_2^2}{a_1^2} = \left(\frac{a_2}{a_1}\right)^2 = \left(\frac{1}{0.606}\right)^2 \approx 2.72
\]

This means Planet_1 has approximately 2.7 times higher transit probability than Planet_2.

### Step 3: Conclusion
The researchers should prioritize observing Planet_1, as it has a significantly higher probability of transiting (~2.7 times higher than Planet_2).

### Option Analysis:
- **A)** Incorrect. Planet_2 is not preferred, and the probability difference is not ~2.25 times.
- **B)** Incorrect. Planet_2 is not preferred, and the probability difference is not ~1.5 times.
- **C)** Incorrect. Planet_1 is preferred, but the probability difference is not ~1.65 times.
- **D)** Correct. Planet_1 is preferred, and the probability difference is ~2.7 times.
