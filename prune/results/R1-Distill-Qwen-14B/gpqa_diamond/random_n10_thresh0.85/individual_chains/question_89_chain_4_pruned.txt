Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me try to break it down.

The question is about a series of reactions starting with 1,3-dibromoadamantane. Let me recap the steps:

First, 1,3-dibromoadamantane is heated with excess KOH at 240°C. The product is a light yellow solid (product 1) with an IR peak at 1720 cm⁻¹ and a specific ¹H NMR spectrum.

Then, product 1 is heated with excess aluminum isopropoxide to form product 2.

Next, ozone is bubbled through a solution of product 2 at -78°C, followed by adding dimethyl sulfide to give product 3. The question is about the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen in product 3's NMR, excluding any exchangeable protons.

Alright, let me tackle each step one by one.

Step 1: Reaction of 1,3-dibromoadamantane with KOH.

I remember that when dihalides are treated with a strong base like KOH, especially in a dehydrohalogenation reaction, elimination occurs. Adamantane is a diamondoid hydrocarbon with a very rigid structure. The molecule 1,3-dibromoadamantane has bromines on adjacent carbons in the adamantane structure.

Heating with KOH would likely lead to an elimination reaction (E2 mechanism) because the base abstracts a β-hydrogen, leading to the formation of a double bond. Since the starting material is 1,3-dibromoadamantane, removing two adjacent bromines could form an allene (a compound with two adjacent double bonds) or a single double bond. Wait, but elimination typically forms one double bond. Hmm.

Wait, no. Wait, in 1,3-dibromoadamantane, the two bromines are on opposite sides of the adamantane structure. The structure of adamantane is a diamondoid, each carbon is connected in a way that each bridgehead is connected to two other bridgeheads. So, 1,3-dibromoadamantane would have bromines on two bridgeheads that are across from each other. When KOH is added, each Br would be eliminated, but wait, no, because each elimination would form a double bond. But if the two bromines are in positions that can lead to conjugated double bonds, maybe the result is a conjugated diene. Wait, but adamantane itself is a polycyclic structure; when dehydrohalogenation occurs, the molecule loses HBr twice, forming two double bonds. So the product would be a diene, maybe a 1,3-diene in the adamantane structure.

Alternatively, perhaps it's the formation of an aza compound, but that's less likely with KOH.

Wait, maybe I'm thinking incorrectly. The reaction is with KOH, which is a strong base. So 1,3-dibromoadamantane would undergo dehydrohalogenation twice, removing two HBr molecules and forming two double bonds. Since the starting material is 1,3-dibromo, the elimination would form 1,3-diene adamantane, but I'm not exactly sure how the structure would look. Alternatively, perhaps it's the formation of a bridgehead double bond, but I'm a bit hazy on the exact structure.

Wait, but let's think about the product. The IR spectrum of product 1 shows a peak at 1720 cm⁻¹. That's a strong carbonyl (C=O) stretch. So product 1 has a carbonyl group. Hmm, that's unexpected because elimination would form a double bond, but carbonyl suggests maybe a ketone or ester or something. Wait, but how?

Wait, maybe I'm wrong. Because when you have a dihalide, like a vicinal dihalide (two adjacent Brs), treatment with a strong base like KOH can lead to elimination, forming an alkene. But if the dihalide is 1,3-dibromo, perhaps the base abstracts a hydrogen from each Br, leading to two eliminations resulting
