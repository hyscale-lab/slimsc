Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here about two stars and their luminosities. Hmm, I remember that luminosity has to do with how much light a star emits. The question says that Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than Star_2, and also a mass 1.5 times larger. But wait, the mass might not directly affect luminosity in this context, right? Because the problem is about black body radiation, which relates to temperature and radius.

The problem states that the wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest are the same. Oh, right, the peak wavelength of a black body's emission is given by Wien's Law: lambda_max = b / T, where b is Wien's displacement constant and T is the temperature. So if both stars have the same lambda_max, their temperatures must be the same. Because same lambda_max implies same T.

So, both stars have the same temperature. Now, the formula for luminosity of a star as a black body is the Stefan-Boltzmann law: L = 4πR²σT⁴, where R is radius, σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant, and T is temperature.

Since both stars have the same T, the ratio of their luminosities depends on the squares of their radii. Because L is proportional to R² when T is constant.

Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times that of Star_2. So R1 = 1.5 R2.

So the luminosity ratio L1/L2 = (R1² T1⁴) / (R2² T2⁴). But since T1 = T2, this simplifies to (R1/R2)² = (1.5)^2 = 2.25. So L1 is 2.25 times L2. Wait, but the options include 2.23, 2.25, etc. So is the answer 2.25? But wait, there's something else: radial velocities.

Wait, the radial velocities are given as 0 and 700 km/s for Star_1 and Star_2. Hmm, does that affect the calculation? Because in the problem statement, the luminosity calculation was done assuming the stars are black bodies, so maybe the radial velocities are a red herring, or perhaps they're used for another part.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing something. Oh, wait, when we measure a star's spectrum, the Doppler shift affects the observed wavelength. Because if a star is moving towards or away from us, the wavelength we see shifts. But the problem says that the wavelengths at which they appear brightest are the same. So the observed wavelengths are the same. So if Star_2 has a higher radial velocity, its observed wavelength would be different if there were no correction.

Wait, so the peak wavelength observed is the same for both stars. But the actual emission peak (the rest wavelength) depends on their temperatures. But in this case, since the observed wavelengths are the same, the Doppler shift must have adjusted for the velocities. So perhaps the actual temperatures are different, but the observed lambda_max is the same. Wait, this could complicate things.

Let me think again. Wien's law is lambda_max = b / T. But if the star is moving with a radial velocity, the observed wavelength would be lambda_observed = lambda_rest * (1 + v_r / c), where v_r is the radial velocity and c is the speed of light, assuming v_r is positive when moving away (redshift) and negative when moving towards (blueshift). 

So if both stars have the same observed lambda_max, but their rest wavelengths are different because of their velocities, then their temperatures would be different. But earlier, I thought their T's were the same because lambda_max is the same. So perhaps that initial assumption was wrong.

Wait, this is a point of confusion. The problem says that the wavelengths at which the stars appeared brightest are the same. So the observed lambda_max is same for both. But their rest lambda_max would be different if their velocities are different.

So, let me re-express this. Let me denote lambda_observed for both stars as lambda_0. So for Star_1, which has radial velocity v1 = 0, its observed lambda_0 is equal to its rest lambda_1. Because v1 is zero, no Doppler shift. So lambda_0 = lambda_1 = b / T1.

For Star_2, which has v2 = 700 km/s. Assuming it's moving away (so positive velocity). So its observed lambda_0 = lambda_2 * (1 + v2/c). So lambda_2 = lambda_0 / (1 + v2/c) = (b / T2) / (1 + v2/c).

But since lambda_0 is the same for both, we have:

For Star_1:
lambda_0 = b / T1.

For Star_2:
lambda
