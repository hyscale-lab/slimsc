Alright, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me start by reading the question carefully.

The question is about finding the energy of the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) when the speed of the nucleus X is 0.96c. The nucleus X is defined as Lithium (Li) with 3 neutrons. The options given are A to D, and I need to pick the correct one.

Hmm, okay. First, I need to understand what the nucleus X is. Lithium with 3 neutrons. Let me think about the composition of lithium isotopes. Lithium usually has an atomic number of 3, which means 3 protons. If it has 3 neutrons, the isotope would be Li-6 because 3 (protons) + 3 (neutrons) = 6 nucleons. So the mass number A is 6.

So the nucleus is Li-6. Now, the problem is about relativistic energy. The speed is given as 0.96c, so I'll need to calculate the total energy of the nucleus when moving at this speed.

I remember that in relativity, the total energy of a particle is given by gamma multiplied by its rest mass energy. The formula is E = gamma * m0c². Gamma is the Lorentz factor, which is 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²).

Wait, so I need to calculate gamma first. Let's plug in v=0.96c.

Gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.96c)^2 / c^2) = 1/sqrt(1 - 0.96²). Let me compute 0.96 squared. 0.96 * 0.96 is 0.9216. So 1 - 0.9216 = 0.0784. The square root of 0.0784 is 0.28 (since 0.28^2 is 0.0784). So gamma is 1 / 0.28 ≈ 3.5714. Hmm, wait, let me double-check that. 0.28 squared is 0.0784, correct. So sqrt(0.0784) is 0.28. So yes, gamma is approximately 3.5714.

But wait, I should be precise. Let me compute 1 / 0.28 exactly. 1/0.28 is equal to 100/28 ≈ 3.57142857. So, about 3.5714.

Now, I need the rest mass energy of the Li-6 nucleus. The rest mass energy is m0c². But wait, I don't have the mass of the Li-6 nucleus. How do I find that?

I think I need to compute the mass of Li-6. The mass of a nucleus can be found using the mass defect formula, but perhaps for this problem, they expect me to use the atomic mass as an approximation. Alternatively, I can recall that the mass of a nucleon (proton or neutron) is about 938 MeV/c² each. So, for Li-6, which has 3 protons and 3 neutrons, the total rest mass
