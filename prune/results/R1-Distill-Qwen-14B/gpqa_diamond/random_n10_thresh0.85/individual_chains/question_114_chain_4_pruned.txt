Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the right reagents for these two reactions. Let me take it step by step.

The first reaction is between butan-2-one (which is methylacetone, I think) and NaCN in the presence of a reagent A. This produces 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Hmm, wait. Butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO. So when it reacts with NaCN, I remember that ketones can undergo nucleophilic addition reactions. Usually, in such cases, the nitrile ion (CN-) would attack the carbonyl carbon. But wait, after the addition, there's a proton involved. Oh right, because the carbonyl oxygen is deprotonated, so when the nucleophile adds, it forms an alkoxide intermediate. Then, to get the proton back, you need an acid work-up.

Wait, but if the reaction is with NaCN, which is a source of CN- and also a strong base because Na+ is a spectator ion. So the reaction might proceed via an acid or base catalysis. Oh, but in the context of such additions, like the formation of cyanohydrins. Oh right, I think when a ketone reacts with a nitrile (like in the presence of an acid catalyst), it forms a cyanohydrin. The cyanohydrin formation typically uses an acid catalyst, like H3O+ (which is a strong acid) or something else.

In the first reaction, the product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Let me draw that structure. The molecule would have a nitrile group (CN) attached to the same carbon as the hydroxyl (OH) group. So from butan-2-one, which is (CH3)2CO, adding a CN and OH group to the carbonyl carbon. That makes sense because the cyanohydrin forms when the ketone reacts with a nitrile under acidic conditions. So the reagent A should be a source of H+ to protonate the carbonyl oxygen, making it more electrophilic, which would allow the CN- to attack.

So for the first reaction, A is probably H3O+ because that's the typical acid catalyst for such additions. Looking at the options, A could be H3O+ in options A or B.

Now the second reaction: 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile reacts with reagent B (in H2O) to give 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid. So the starting material has a nitrile group, and the product has a carboxylic acid group. So this is a nitrile to carboxylic acid conversion.

I think that to convert a nitrile to a carboxylic acid, you typically use a hydrolysis reaction. Nitriles can be hydrolyzed under acidic or basic conditions. The general process is either using H2O with HCl (acidic conditions) or with NaOH (basic conditions). But wait, the question says that B is H2O, but in the presence of another reagent. Wait, no, the reaction is: [compound] + B (H2O
