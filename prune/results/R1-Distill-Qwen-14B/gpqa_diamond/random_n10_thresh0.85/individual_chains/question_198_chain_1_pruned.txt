Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here. Let me read it again and try to figure out what's going on. Hmm, it's about cobalt(II) ions and thiocyanate in a solution. The question is about finding the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt complexes among all the cobalt species.

Wait, the question gives me the stability constants β1 to β4. Stability constants, right, those are the formation constants for the complexes. Each β represents the equilibrium constant for the formation of a complex with a certain number of SCN- ligands.

So, the problem is asking for the percentage of the Co(SCN)_2^2+ complex, which is the blue one. I remember that the different complexes have different colors, and the stability constants tell us how much each complex forms.

The solution has c(Co) = 1e-2 M and [SCN^-] = 0.1 M. So the initial concentrations are 0.01 M Co²+ and 0.1 M SCN-.

I think I need to find the fraction of each possible complex (from n=0 to n=4 ligands) and then sum up the fractions for the species with n=2 (the blue ones). But wait, the Co can form complexes with 1, 2, 3, or 4 SCN- ions. Each step has a different β value.

The stability constants given are β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16. Wait, wait, β1 is for the first complex, which is Co(SCN)²+? Or is it Co(SCN)²+ for β1? Let's think. The stability constants for the formation of complexes are typically written as:

Co²+ + n SCN^- ⇌ Co(SCN)_n²−(n−2) or something. Hmm, maybe I should think in terms of each step. Each β represents the constant for adding another SCN-.

Wait, no, the stability constant for each complex is cumulative. So β1 is the formation constant for Co(SCN)²+, β2 for Co(SCN)_2²+, β3 for Co(SCN)_3^+, and β4 for Co(SCN)_4^2- or something. Wait, not sure about the charges, but the key point is that each βn is the equilibrium constant for the nth complex.

So, the formation of each complex
