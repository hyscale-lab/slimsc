Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me read it again carefully.

The question is about titrating acetic acid with sodium hydroxide. The process involves first diluting acetic acid with water and then titrating it. We need to find the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point.

Alright, let's break this down step by step. I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, but I'll try to remember.

First, the initial setup: We have 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid. Then, we dilute it with 20.00 cm³ of water. So that's mixing two equal volumes. Wait, when you mix equal volumes, the concentration halves, right? Because concentration is moles per liter, and if you double the volume, the concentration halves. So initial concentration is 0.05 M. After diluting, the concentration of acetic acid becomes 0.025 M. Let me just confirm that: 20 cm³ is 0.02 L. So moles of acetic acid before dilution would be 0.02 L * 0.05 mol/L = 0.001 mol. After adding 20 cm³ of water (another 0.02 L), the total volume is 40 cm³ or 0.04 L. So new concentration is 0.001 mol / 0.04 L = 0.025 M. Yep, that makes sense.

Next, we're titrating this diluted acetic acid with 0.1 M NaOH. So the reaction is between acetic acid (CH3COOH) and NaOH (a strong base). The reaction should be:

CH3COOH + NaOH → CH3COO^- Na+ + H2O

So the stoichiometry is 1:1. That's important for calculating equivalence points.

The first part of the question asks for the pH at 25% titration. 25% means that 25% of the acetic acid has been neutralized by the NaOH. Alternatively, it could mean that 25% of the required NaOH to reach equivalence has been added. I think it's the latter. So, we need to find the pH when 25% of the equivalence point volume has been added.

Wait, but how much is that? Let me think. Let's first find out how much NaOH is needed to reach the equivalence point.

Moles of acetic acid initially (after dilution) is 0.025 M * 0.04 L = 0.001 mol. Since the reaction is 1:1, moles of NaOH needed at equivalence is also 0.001 mol.

The concentration of NaOH is 0.1 M. So, the volume of NaOH needed at equivalence is moles / concentration = 0.001 / 0.1 = 0.01 L or 10 cm³. So, the equivalence volume is 10 cm³.

Therefore, 25% titration would mean adding 2.5 cm³ of NaOH. Because 25% of 10 cm³ is 2.5 cm³.

Now, the moles of NaOH added at 25% is 0.1 M * 0.0025 L = 0.00025 mol. Since each mole of NaOH neutralizes one mole of acetic acid, we have 0.00025 mol of CH3COOH converted to CH3COO^-.

So, the initial moles of acetic acid are 0.001 mol. After adding NaOH, moles of CH3COOH left: 0.001 - 0.00025 = 0.00075 mol. Moles of acetate ion (CH3COO^-) formed: 0.00025 mol.

But wait, when we add NaOH, the total volume of the solution increases. The initial solution after dilution was 40 cm³. Adding 2.5 cm³ of NaOH gives a total volume of 42.5 cm³ or 0.0425 L.

So, the concentrations would be:

[CH3COOH] = 0.00075 mol / 0.0425 L ≈ 0.017647 M
