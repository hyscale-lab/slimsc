Okay, so I'm trying to figure out which planet, Planet_1 or Planet_2, has a higher probability of transiting. Both have been detected via the RV method, so their masses are known. The question is about transit probability, so I need to remember what factors influence that.

I recall that the probability of a planet transiting its star depends on the size of the planet relative to the star and the orbital distance. Specifically, the transit probability (P) is proportional to (R_planet / R_star)² multiplied by (1/a), where 'a' is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit. Wait, no, wait. I think it's more about the ratio of the planet's orbital distance to the star's radius. Alternatively, another way I remember is P ≈ (R_star / a) * something. Or maybe the probability is (R_p / R_s)² * (1 / (a / R_s)), but I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact formula.

Wait, let me think again. I remember that the probability of a transit is given by the formula P = (R_s / a)² * (1 - e²)^(3/2) / (1 + (m_p/M_s)^(1/3)) ), but since both planets have circular orbits (e=0), the (1-e²) term is 1. Also, since the masses of the planets are the same, and the host stars have different masses, the (m_p/M_s) term would be same for both because both planets have same mass and host stars have different Ms. Wait, no, actually, the host stars have different masses. Let me think.

Wait, the formula for transit probability may actually be P = (R_p / R_s)^2 * (1/( (a/R_s) * (1 + (M_p/(3 M_s))^(1/3)) )) ) )? Hmm, I think I'm getting confused. Maybe I should look for a simpler approach.

Alternatively, I've heard that for a planet to transit, the orbital plane must be aligned edge-on relative to our line of sight. The probability depends on the ratio of the star's radius to the planet's orbital distance. The higher this ratio, the higher the probability because the planet has a larger chance of passing in front.

Wait, the formula I think is P = (R_* / a)², but that can't be right because I remember that the probability depends on the relative size of the orbit to the star's size. Let me get this straight.

Oh wait! The transit probability is approximately (R*/a)^2. Because the chance that the planet's orbital plane is aligned such that it passes in front of the star is proportional to the ratio of the star's size to the orbital distance. But wait, actually, no. The probability is the area of the star (πR_*²) divided by the area of the sphere from which the planet could be viewed edge-on (something involving a²), but maybe that's more complicated.

Alternatively, another approach: The probability P is given by (R*/a)^2, but I'm not sure. Or maybe it's (R*/a) * (something else). Alternatively, I've read before that the probability is roughly ( (R_* + R_p) / a )^2. But since R_p is much smaller than R_*, we can approximate it as (R_*/a)^2.

Wait, but I'm pretty sure the correct
