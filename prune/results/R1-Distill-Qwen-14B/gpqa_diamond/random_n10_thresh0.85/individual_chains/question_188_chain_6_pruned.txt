Okay, so I've got this problem about a rhombohedral crystal, and I need to find the interplanar distance for the (111) plane. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my crystallography, but let me think through this.

Alright, the problem states that the interatomic distance is 10 Angstroms, and all the angles alpha, beta, gamma are 30 degrees. So it's a rhombohedral structure with all angles equal. Right, a rhombohedron is a type of crystal system where all edges are equal, but the angles between them are the same but not necessarily 90 degrees. Wait, no, actually, in a rhombohedral system, the edges can be of equal length but the angles can vary. Oh, but wait, in this case, all angles are 30 degrees. So that's an oblique rhombohedral system, I think.

So, the interplanar distance d for a given plane (hkl) in a crystal is given by the formula derived from the crystal planes and lattice parameters. The formula I remember is something like d = a / sqrt( (h² + k² + l²) - 2(hk cos γ) - 2(hl cos β) - 2(kl cos α) ) ), but wait, I'm not sure if that's exactly right. Alternatively, I think the formula for interplanar spacing d is:

d_{hkl} = \frac{a}{\sqrt{ (h^2 + k^2 + l^2) - 2(hk \cos \gamma) - 2(hl \cos \beta) - 2(kl \cos \alpha) } }

But wait, wait, in a rhombohedral system, all the angles are equal, so alpha = beta = gamma. So cos(alpha) = cos(beta) = cos(gamma). Also, since the lattice is rhombohedral, the a, b, c edges are all equal. So a = b = c = the given interatomic distance, which is 10 A here.

So substituting, the denominator becomes sqrt( h² + k² + l² - 2hk cos gamma - 2hl cos gamma - 2kl cos gamma ). Or wait, let me think about the formula again. Another way I remember is that the formula for d is:

d = \frac{a}{\sqrt{h² + k² + l² + 2(hk \cos α + hl cos β + kl cos γ)}}}

Wait, no, wait a second. Maybe I mixed up the signs. Let me get this straight. The general formula in terms of the Miller indices h, k, l and the lattice parameters is:

d_{hkl} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{ (h^2/a^2) + (k^2/b^2) + (l^2/c^2) - 2(hk cos γ)/(a b) - 2(hl cos β)/(a c) - 2(kl cos α)/(b c) } }

But in a cubic system, a=b=c and all angles are 90 degrees, so the formula simplifies. But here, it's a rhombohedral system, so a=b=c but angles are 30 degrees each. So in this case, a = b = c = 10 A, and alpha = beta = gamma = 30 degrees.

So let me substitute all into the formula. Let me make sure I have the right formula. Oh wait, another approach: the general formula for interplanar distance in a crystal is:

d = \frac{a}{\sqrt{ (h^2 + k^2 + l^2) - 2(hk cos γ) - 2(hl cos β) - 2(kl cos α) } } 

Wait, but I'm now confused because I've seen different versions. Let me double-check.

Wait, I think I should refer to the formula as derived from the Bragg law for crystal planes. The standard formula is:

d_{hkl} = \frac{a}{\sqrt{ (h^2 + k^2 + l^2) - 2(hk \cos \gamma) - 2(hl \cos \beta) - 2(kl \cos \alpha) } }

But wait, no, another source said that the formula is:

d = \frac{1}{\sqrt{ (h/a)^2 + (k/b)^2 + (l/c)^2 - 2(hk cos γ)/(ab) - 2(hl cos β)/(ac) - 2(kl cos α)/(bc) } }

But for a rhombohedral system, a = b = c = a, and alpha=beta=gamma=θ, say 30 degrees. So substituting, the formula becomes:

d = \frac{a}{\sqrt{ h² + k² + l² - 2 h k cos θ - 2 h l cos θ - 2 k l cos θ } }

Because in the denominator, each term becomes h²/a² = h²/(a²), etc. So when you take the reciprocal and multiply by a, you get a over sqrt( ... ).

Wait, perhaps I should approach this more carefully. Let me define the variables correctly.

In a rhombohedral crystal, the lattice parameters are a, b, c, but in this case, a = b = c, and the angles are all equal to 30 degrees. So, the unit cell is a rhombohedron with all edges equal and angles 30 degrees.

The interplanar distance for the (hkl) plane is given by:

d = \frac{1}{\sqrt{ (h^2/a^2) + (k^2/b^2) + (l^2/c^2) - 2(hk cos γ)/(a b) - 2(hl cos β)/(a c) - 2(kl cos α)/(b c) } }

Since a = b = c = a, and all angles are 30 degrees (so cos 30° = √3/2 ≈ 0.8660), the equation simplifies.

Let's compute each term:

1. For each (h²/a²), since a = a, it's h²/a², but since a is 10 A, but in the formula, it's 1/d², so perhaps I'm getting ahead of myself.

Wait, let me correct. The formula is:

d = \frac{1}{\sqrt{ (h/a)^2 + (k/b)^2 + (l/c)^2 - 2(hk cos γ)/(a b) - 2(hl cos β)/(a c) - 2(kl cos α)/(b c) } }

Since a = b = c = a, this simplifies to:

d = \frac{1}{\sqrt{ (h² + k² + l²)/a² - 2 (hk + hl + kl) cos θ / a² } }

Factor out 1/a² inside the square root:

d = \frac{1}{\sqrt{ [ (h² + k² + l²) - 2 (hk + hl + kl) cos θ ] / a² } }

Which simplifies to:

d = \frac{a}{\sqrt{ (h² + k² + l²) - 2 (hk + hl + kl) cos θ } }

Wait, but wait, let me think again. The term under the square root is [ (h² + k² + l²) - 2(hk cos γ + hl cos β + kl cos α) ] divided by a². So the square root of that would be sqrt( numerator ) / a. Hence, the reciprocal would be a / sqrt( numerator ), so yes, the formula becomes:

d = a / sqrt( h² + k² + l² - 2 (hk cos γ + hl cos β + kl cos α) )

But in our case, since all angles are 30 degrees, and a = 10 A, and the plane is (111), so h=1, k=1, l=1.

So substituting, the denominator becomes sqrt( 1 + 1 + 1 - 2(1*1 * cos30 + 1*1 * cos30 + 1*1 * cos30) )

Let me compute that step by step.

Compute the numerator inside the sqrt:

h² + k² + l² = 1 + 1 + 1 = 3.

Now the term to subtract is 2*( hk cos γ + hl cos β + kl cos α )

Since gamma = beta = alpha = 30 degrees, and hk = 1*1=1, etc.

So each of the three terms
