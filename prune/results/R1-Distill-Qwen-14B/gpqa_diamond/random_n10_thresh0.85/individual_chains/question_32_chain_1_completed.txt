Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) and the energy of a nucleus moving at a certain speed. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through it step by step.

The question says that the nucleus is X, which is Li with 3 neutrons. Wait, Li usually has 3 protons, right? So if it's Li^6 perhaps? Because Li has atomic number 3, and if it has 3 neutrons, the mass number is 3 + 3 = 6. So the nucleus is ^6Li.

We need to find the energy of the RHIC so that the speed of the nucleus X is 0.96c. So the energy here is the total relativistic energy of the nucleus. I remember that the relativistic energy is given by the gamma factor multiplied by the rest mass energy.

The formula for gamma is 1 divided by the square root of (1 minus v squared over c squared). So gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²). Since v is 0.96c, let's compute that.

Wait, let's compute v²/c²: (0.96c)^2 / c² = 0.96² = 0.9216. So 1 - 0.9216 is 0.0784. Then sqrt(0.0784) is 0.28. Because 0.28 squared is 0.0784 exactly. So 1 / 0.28 is approximately 3.5714. Wait, let's calculate that precisely. 1 / 0.28 equals what? 0.28 is 7/25, so 25/7 is about 3.57142857... So gamma is approximately 3.5714.

Now, the rest mass energy of the nucleus is needed. The rest mass of a ^6Li nucleus is the mass of 6 nucleons. Each nucleon (proton or neutron) has a rest mass of about 938 MeV/c². So for 6 nucleons, it's 6 * 938 MeV.

Wait, 6 * 938 is 5628 MeV. Wait, but wait, actually, the exact mass of the nucleus is a bit less than the sum of individual nucleons due to binding energy, but I think for this problem, we can approximate the rest mass energy as 6 * 938 MeV. So that would be 5628 MeV, which is 5.628 GeV.

So the total energy is gamma multiplied by the rest mass energy. Gamma is about 3.5714, and the rest energy is 5.628 GeV.

Calculating that: 3.5714 * 5.628 GeV.

Let me compute that step by step. 3 * 5.628 = 16.884. 0.5714 *5.628. Hmm, 0.5 *5.628 is 2.814. 0.0714 is approximately 0.07, so 0.07 *5.628 is about 0.394. So total would be 2.814 + 0.394 ≈ 3.208. So the 0.5714 part gives about 3.208. Adding to 16.884: 16.884 +3.208 = 20.092 GeV.

Wait, but maybe I should calculate it more accurately. Alternatively, perhaps I should calculate 3.5714 *5.628.

Let me compute 3.5714 *5.628:

First, 3 *5.628 = 16.884

0.5714 *5.628. Let's compute 0.5 *5.628: 2.814.

0.0714 *5.628. Let's compute 0.07*5.628=0.394, 0.0014*5.628=0.00788. So total 0.394+0.00788≈0.40188.

So 2.814 +0.40188≈3.21588.

So total energy is 16.884 +3.21588=20.09988 GeV, approximately 20.10 GeV.

Looking at the options:

A) 18.475 GeV

B) 23.069 GeV

C) 20.132 GeV

D) 21.419 GeV

So the closest is option C, 20.132 GeV. But wait, let me check if I made any approximation errors.

Wait, perhaps the rest mass of ^6Li is not exactly 6 *938 MeV. Because the actual mass of ^6Li is a bit less than 6 nucleons. Wait, but in particle physics, when calculating the rest mass energy, for heavy ions, the rest mass is approximately the sum of the nucleons' rest masses. Or maybe we should use the exact atomic mass.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the exact rest mass of ^6Li in MeV/c².

Wait, the exact mass of ^6Li is about 6 * 938 minus the binding energy. But the binding energy for light nuclei isn't that big compared to the total mass. Let me check: the binding energy for ^6Li. Hmm, I think for ^6Li, the binding energy per nucleon is about 2.4 MeV (I'm not exactly sure, but let's say about 2 MeV per nucleon for light nuclei).

Wait, but wait: the mass of a ^6Li nucleus is (number of nucleons) * mass of a nucleon minus the binding energy. So 6 * 938 MeV/c² minus the binding energy in MeV/c².

Wait, no, the binding energy is in MeV, but each MeV is 1e6 eV. The mass is in MeV/c², so the binding energy (in MeV) is the total energy, which for mass, would be converted using E=mc². So each MeV of binding energy corresponds to a mass deficit of 1 MeV/c².

So for ^6Li, the binding energy is approximately 6 * 2.4 MeV? Wait, wait, the binding energy per nucleon for ^6Li is about 5.4 MeV, I think. Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me think differently.

The exact mass of ^6Li is 6 * (mass of a proton) + (number of neutrons) * (mass of a neutron) minus binding energy.

Wait, but perhaps it's better to look up the exact mass. Hmm, but in the absence of that, perhaps the approximation is to take the rest mass as approximately 6 * 938 MeV/c², which is 5628 MeV or 5.628 GeV.

But wait, wait, actually, the exact mass of ^6Li is known. Let me think: the atomic mass of lithium-6 is about 6.017 g/mol. Wait, but that's the molar mass. To get the rest mass of a single nucleus, we can calculate it based on the number of protons and neutrons.

Wait, each proton is about 1.007276 atomic mass units (amu), and each neutron is about 1.008665 amu.

Wait, but wait, the actual mass of the nucleus is the sum of the masses of its protons and neutrons minus the mass of the electrons, plus the binding energy (but that's already accounted for in the atomic mass given).

Wait, no, the atomic mass includes the electrons as well. So probably, it's better to look up the exact mass of ^6Li.

Wait, but perhaps I can find that. ^6Li has a mass of approximately 6.017 amu. Wait, 1 amu is approximately 931.5 MeV/c². So 6.017 amu * 931.5 MeV/c² per amu. Let's compute that.

6.017 * 931.5 = ?

Calculating 6 *931.5 = 5589 MeV.

0.017 *931.5 ≈ 15.8355 MeV.

So total is 5589 +15.8355 ≈ 5604.8355 MeV, or 5.6048 GeV.

So the rest energy is approximately 5.6048 GeV.

Wait, that's more precise than the 5.628 GeV I used earlier. So previous calculation used 5.628 GeV, but the actual rest mass is about 5.6048 GeV.

So now, using the more accurate rest mass, let's recalculate the energy.

Gamma is 3.5714, as before.

So 3.5714 * 5.6048 GeV.

Let me compute this accurately.

Let me compute 3 *5.6048 =16.8144.

0.5714 *5.6048.

Breaking it down:

0.5 *5.6048 =2.8024.

0.0714 *5.6048.

First, 0.07 *5.6048 = 0.392336.

0.0014 *5.6048 = 0.00784672.

Adding them together: 0.392336 + 0.00784672 ≈ 0.40018272.

So 0.5714 *5.6048 = 2.8024 + 0.40018272 = 3.20258272 GeV.

So total energy is 16.8144 +3.20258272 ≈ 20.01698 GeV.

Wait, that's approximately 20.017 GeV.

Looking back at the options, option C is 20.132 GeV, which is a bit higher. But wait, perhaps I made an error in the calculation.

Alternatively, perhaps I should calculate gamma more accurately. Let's recheck gamma.

v = 0.96c.

v²/c² = (0.96)^2 = 0.9216.

1 - v²/c² = 1 -0.9216 =0.0784.

sqrt(0.0784) = 0.28.

So gamma is 1/0.28 = 3.57142857...

So that part is accurate.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of 3.5714 *5.6048.

Let me compute it step by step:

3.5714 *5.6048.

3.5 *5.6048 = 19.6168.

0.0714 *5.6048 = 0.40018 (as before).

So 19.6168 + 0.40018 =20.01698 GeV.

So about 20.017 GeV.

Hmm, but option C is 20.132 GeV, which is about 115 MeV higher.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the rest mass calculation.

Wait, let's recalculate the rest mass of ^6Li accurately.

The atomic mass of ^6Li is approximately 6.017 atomic mass units (amu). Each amu is 1.66053906660e-27 kg, but in terms of energy, 1 amu is about 931.494 MeV/c².

So 6.017 amu * 931.494 MeV/c²/amu = ?

Calculating:

6 *931.494 = 5588.964 MeV.

0.017 *931.494 = approximately 15.835 MeV.

So total is 5588.964 + 15.835 ≈ 5604.799 MeV, which is 5.604799 GeV.

So rest energy is about 5.6048 GeV.

So energy calculation is 3.5714 *5.6048.

Wait, perhaps I should compute 3.57142857 *5.6048 more accurately.

Alternatively, perhaps using a calculator approach:

3.57142857 *5.6048.

Let me compute 3 *5.6048 =16.8144.

0.57142857 *5.6048.

Breaking it down:

0.5 *5.6048 = 2.8024.

0.07142857 *5.6048.

0.07 *5.6048=0.392336.

0.00142857 *5.6048 ≈ 0.00799 (since 0.001 *5.6048=0.0056048, 0.00042857 *5.6048≈0.0024099. So total 0.0056048+0.0024099=0.0080147. So 0.00142857 *5.6048≈0.0080147.

So 0.392336 +0.0080147 ≈0.4003507.

So 0.57142857 *5.6048 ≈2.8024 +0.4003507≈3.2027507.

So total energy is 16.8144 +3.2027507 =20.01715 GeV.

Approximately 20.017 GeV.

Looking at the options again: option C is 20.132 GeV, which is a bit higher. Hmm, so perhaps I made a mistake in the rest mass calculation. Or maybe I should consider relativistic effects accurately.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the problem is not considering the rest energy as just the mass of the nucleus, but as the sum of the rest energies of each nucleon minus the binding energy. But that complicates things, as I would need the exact binding energy. Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects me to use the approximate rest mass of 6 *938 MeV.

Wait, let me try that. If I take rest mass as 6 *938 MeV = 5628 MeV=5.628 GeV.

Then energy is 3.57142857 *5.628 GeV.

Compute 3.57142857 *5.628.

3 *5.628 =16.884.

0.57142857 *5.628.

0.5 *5.628=2.814.

0.07142857 *5.628.

0.07 *5.628=0.394.

0.00142857 *5.628= approx 0.00799.

So 0.394 +0.00799=0.40199.

So 0.5 *5.628 is 2.814, plus 0.40199 gives 3.21599.

So total energy is 16.884 +3.21599=20.09999 GeV, approximately 20.10 GeV.

Which is option C at 20.132 GeV. Hmm, but I'm getting 20.10 GeV, and option C is 20.132.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the gamma calculation. Let me recheck gamma.

v =0.96c → v²/c²=0.9216 → 1-v²/c²=0.0784.

sqrt(0.0784)=0.28 → gamma =1/0.28=3.57142857.

Yes, that's correct.

Wait, perhaps the rest mass is more accurately 5.6048 GeV as calculated earlier, leading to 20.017 GeV. But the closest option is 20.132 GeV.

Alternatively, maybe I should use more precise computation for gamma.

Wait, another approach: compute gamma as 1/sqrt(1 - (0.96)^2).

Let me compute 1 -0.96^2 more accurately.

0.96^2: 0.96*0.96 = 0.9216.

So 1-0.9216=0.0784.

sqrt(0.0784)=0.28 exactly, because 0.28^2 is 0.0784.

So gamma is exactly 1/0.28= 3.57142857... So that's correct.

Wait, perhaps the issue is that for the rest mass, I should include the actual binding energy.

But without exact data, perhaps the problem expects us to use the approximation of 6 *938 MeV, leading to the energy being approximately 20.1 GeV, which is close to option C.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the rest mass.

Wait, let me check another approach: atomic mass of ^6Li is 6.017 u (atomic mass units). 1 u is 931.5 MeV/c².

So 6.017 *931.5 = ?

6 *931.5 = 5589 MeV.

0.017 *931.5=15.8355 MeV.

Total is 5604.8355 MeV=5.6048355 GeV.

So rest energy E_rest =5.6048 GeV.

So E=gamma *E_rest =3.5714 *5.6048 GeV → 3.5714 *5.6048.

Let me compute this multiplication more precisely.

3.5714 *5.6048.

Let me write it as (3 + 0.5 + 0.07 + 0.0014) *5.6048.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to calculate 3.5714 *5.6048:

Multiply 3.5714 by 5.6048.

3.5714 * 5 =17.857.

3.5714 *0.6048 = ?

Let me compute 3.5714 *0.6 =2.14284.

3.5714 *0.0048=0.01714272.

So 2.14284 +0.01714272 =2.15998272.

So total is 17.857 +2.15998272=20.01698272 GeV.

So approximately 20.017 GeV.

Which is around 20.017 GeV, which is not exactly any of the options. The closest is option C:20.132 GeV, but that's a bit higher. So perhaps I made a miscalculation.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the rest mass energy is taken as the sum of the individual protons and neutrons without considering binding, but that would be 6 *938 MeV=5628 MeV=5.628 GeV.

So E=3.5714 *5.628= ?

3.5714 *5=17.857, 3.5714*0.628= ?

3.5714 *0.6=2.14284.

3.5714 *0.028=0.100.

Total: 2.14284 +0.100=2.24284.

So 3.5714 *5.628=17.857+2.24284=20.1 GeV.

Wait, that would give 20.1 GeV, which is option C's 20.132 GeV.

But wait, the calculation in this case gives 3.5714 *5.628= approx 20.1 GeV, which is very close to option C (20.132 GeV). So perhaps the intended answer is option C.

But why the discrepancy between using the exact atomic mass (5.6048 GeV) leading to 20.017 GeV and using the sum (5.628 GeV) leading to 20.1 GeV?

Ah, perhaps the problem expects us to ignore the binding energy and take the rest mass as the sum of individual nucleons. So in that case, the rest mass is 5.628 GeV, leading to E=20.1 GeV.

So the correct answer would be option C: 20.132 GeV.

Alternatively, perhaps the exact calculation would require using more precise values. But given the options, the closest is option C.


To determine the energy of the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) for a ^6Li nucleus moving at a speed of \( v = 0.96c \), we calculate the relativistic energy using the formula:

\[
E = \gamma \cdot E_{\text{rest}}
\]

where \( \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}} \) is the Lorentz factor, and \( E_{\text{rest}} \) is the rest mass energy of the nucleus.

### Step 1: Calculate \( \gamma \)
Given \( v = 0.96c \), we compute:
\[
v^2/c^2 = (0.96)^2 = 0.9216
\]
\[
1 - v^2/c^2 = 1 - 0.9216 = 0.0784
\]
\[
\sqrt{0.0784} = 0.28
\]
\[
\gamma = \frac{1}{0.28} \approx 3.5714
\]

### Step 2: Determine \( E_{\text{rest}} \)
The nucleus is ^6Li, which has a mass of approximately \( 6.017 \, \text{amu} \). Using the conversion \( 1 \, \text{amu} \approx 931.5 \, \text{MeV}/c^2 \), the rest mass energy is:
\[
E_{\text{rest}} = 6.017 \times 931.5 \, \text{MeV} \approx 5604.8355 \, \text{MeV} = 5.6048 \, \text{GeV}
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the Total Energy
Using \( E = \gamma \cdot E_{\text{rest}} \):
\[
E = 3.5714 \cdot 5.6048 \, \text{GeV}
\]
Breaking this into parts:
\[
3.5714 \cdot 5.6048 = 3.5714 \cdot (5 + 0.6048) = 3.5714 \cdot 5 + 3.5714 \cdot 0.6048
\]
\[
3.5714 \cdot 5 = 17.857
\]
\[
3.5714 \cdot 0.6048 \approx 2.15998
\]
\[
E \approx 17.857 + 2.15998 = 20.01698 \, \text{GeV}
\]

### Step 4: Compare with Options
The calculated energy is approximately \( 20.017 \, \text{GeV} \). Among the given options:
- **A) 18.475 GeV**: Too low.
- **B) 23.069 GeV**: Too high.
- **C) 20.132 GeV**: Closest to the calculated value.
- **D) 21.419 GeV**: Too high.

### Conclusion
The closest option to the calculated energy is **C) 20.132 GeV**. This slight discrepancy may arise from rounding or approximations in the rest mass energy calculation.

Answer: C
