Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem to solve, and I'm a bit confused but I'll try to think it through. The question is about selecting the right reagents for two reactions. Let me read it carefully.

The first reaction is butan-2-one (which is methyl isopropyl ketone, I think) reacting with NaCN and reagent A to form 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. The second reaction is 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile reacting with reagent B (and water) to become 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid.

I remember that when ketones react with nitriles, it's probably a nucleophilic addition. Wait, but butan-2-one is a ketone. So, maybe it's a substitution reaction? Or perhaps a cyanide adding into the carbonyl.

Wait, no, wait. I think the reaction here is a nucleophilic addition. The ketone (butan-2-one) has a carbonyl group. When you add a nucleophile like CN-, it would attack the carbonyl carbon, forming a cyanohydrin. Oh right, cyanohydrins! So the product would have both an alcohol and a nitrile group. But wait, the product given is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Let me visualize that. The structure would be CH2-C(OH)(CN)-CH2-CH3, I think. Because butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO, so adding CN would give (CH3)2C(OH)CN.

So for the first reaction, the reagent A is needed along with NaCN. I recall that to form a cyanohydrin, you typically use a strong acid as a catalyst. Because the formation of the cyanohydrin involves the acid catalysis where the carbonyl oxygen is protonated, making the carbonyl more electrophilic, so the CN- can attack. So reagent A is probably H3O+ or some acid.

Looking at the options, the first part (A) can be H3O+ (options A and B), or NaHSO3 (options C and D). Wait, NaHSO3 is sodium bisulfite. That's used in other reactions, like the reduction of carbonyl groups. For example, in the formation of bisulfite adducts or in the sulfite addition for reductions. But in this case, I think it's a simple acid catalysis for the cyanohydrin formation. So reagent A is likely H3O+.

So for the first reaction, A is H3O+.

Now the second reaction: the starting material is 2-hydroxybutanenitrile with some substituents (the 4-benzylphenyl group), but I think the main point is the functional groups. It's a nitrile and a hydroxyl group. The product is a carboxylic acid. So, how do you convert a nitrile to a carboxylic acid? I remember that nitriles can be hydrolyzed under acidic or basic conditions. In acidic conditions, you typically use H2O with HCl as a catalyst, perhaps. Wait, or maybe H3O+ again?

Wait, the hydrolysis of nitriles to carboxylic acids generally requires strong acidic or basic conditions. For example, in the presence of H2O and HCl (like HCl in H2O and heat), the nitrile would hydrolyze to a carboxylic acid. Alternatively, under basic conditions, you might get a different product, like a carboxylate salt, which can then be acidified.

But in the second reaction, the reagent is B and H2O. So the product is a carboxylic acid, so probably the hydrolysis is done under acidic conditions. So B would be HCl. Because HCl in water would provide the acidic environment needed for the nitrile to hydrolyze to the carboxylic acid.

Looking at the options, the second part (B) is either HCl (options A and C) or CH3COOH (options B and D). So if the correct reagent is HCl, then the options would be A or C.

Wait, but let me think again. Another possibility is that the second reaction uses an acid catalyst, like H3O+ again. But in the options, for B, the options are HCl, CH3COOH, etc.

Wait, the reaction is 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile reacting with B (H2O) to form 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid. So it's a hydrolysis of the nitrile to a carboxylic acid.

So the conditions are H2O and an acid. So the reagent B should be an acid. HCl is an acid, so option A has B as HCl. But another possibility is that the acid is provided by H3O+, but that's not one of the options for B.

Wait, looking at the options:

Option A: A= H3O+, B= HCl

Option C: A= NaHSO3, B= HCl

So in the second reaction, if B is HCl, that would fit with what I thought. So for the second reaction, B is HCl.

So putting it together, the first reaction uses H3O+ (so A is H3O+), and the second uses HCl (so B is HCl). So the correct option is A.

Wait, but let me think about the first reaction again. Could it be that reagent A is NaHSO3? For instance, in some reactions, like the addition of HCN, sometimes a bisulfite is used as a catalyst. Wait, but I'm not sure.

Wait, the formation of cyanohydrin typically uses an acid catalyst. For example, in the presence of H2SO4 or H3O+ to protonate the carbonyl oxygen, making it more electrophilic. So the first reagent A is H3O+, which is option A or B.

The second reaction requires HCl as the acid, so the correct option is A: A=H3O+, B=HCl.

Wait, but another thought: in the first reaction, could NaHSO3 (sodium bisulfite) be a catalyst? I remember that sometimes bisulfite is used as a reagent in the hydrolysis of nitriles to produce amines, but perhaps not in the formation of cyanohydrins.

Alternatively, maybe for the first reaction, the conditions are different. Let me think again. The starting material is a ketone and NaCN. So the reaction is ketone + NaCN → cyanohydrin.

The typical reaction is the acid-catalyzed addition of HCN. So, in the presence of an acid, like H3O+, the ketone becomes protonated, the carbonyl becomes more electrophilic, and then the CN- (from NaCN) attacks the carbonyl carbon, leading to the formation of the cyanohydrin.

So reagent A is H3O+.

So in the options, option A and B have A as H3O+, with B being HCl and CH3COOH respectively.

Then for the second reaction, B is H2O and reagent B. Since it's a hydrolysis of nitrile to carboxylic acid, the condition is H2O and acid. So B is HCl, which is in option A.

So the correct answer is option A.


The first reaction involves the formation of a cyanohydrin from butan-2-one and NaCN. This reaction typically requires an acid catalyst to protonate the carbonyl oxygen, making the carbonyl carbon more electrophilic for nucleophilic attack by CN⁻. Among the options, H₃O⁺ (a strong acid) is the suitable reagent for this purpose, as it facilitates the formation of the cyanohydrin.

The second reaction involves the hydrolysis of a nitrile group to a carboxylic acid. This process requires an acidic environment, and HCl in water is a common reagent for such hydrolysis reactions. HCl provides the necessary acidic conditions to convert the nitrile group into a carboxylic acid.

From the options:
- **Option A**: A = H₃O⁺, B = HCl. This matches the requirements for both reactions.
- **Option B**: A = H₃O⁺, B = CH₃COOH. While H₃O⁺ is correct for the first reaction, CH₃COOH is not strong enough to effectively hydrolyze the nitrile in the second reaction.
- **Option C**: A = NaHSO₃, B = HCl. NaHSO₃ is not suitable for the first reaction, as it is not typically used for cyanohydrin formation.
- **Option D**: A = NaHSO₃, B = CH₃COOH. Neither reagent is suitable for the respective reactions.

Thus, the correct answer is **Option A**, where A = H₃O⁺ and B = HCl.

Answer: A
