Okay, so I need to find the energy of the RHIC when the speed of the nucleus X is 0.96c. Hmm, nucleus X is Li with 3 neutrons. Wait, Li is lithium. Let me think, the isotopes of lithium. So, Li typically has 3 protons. If it's Li with 3 neutrons, that would make it Li-6, right? Because 3 protons plus 3 neutrons is 6 nucleons. So the mass number is 6.

So the nucleus is Li-6. Now, I need to find the energy when its speed is 0.96 times the speed of light. I think this involves relativistic mechanics because the speed is a significant fraction of c.

The energy of a relativistic particle is given by the total energy formula, which is gamma multiplied by the rest mass energy. The formula is E = γ mc². But wait, since the units in the options are GeV, which is a unit of energy, and the rest mass would be in GeV/c², I think I should handle the units carefully.

First, I need to calculate the rest mass energy of the Li-6 nucleus. The mass of a nucleus is approximately the sum of the masses of its protons and neutrons, but considering that the binding energy is subtracted. But wait, for heavy ions, the rest mass is roughly the sum of the individual nucleon masses minus the binding energy. But maybe for this problem, we can approximate the rest mass using the known mass of the Li-6 nucleus.

Alternatively, perhaps I can calculate the rest mass using the atomic mass. Let me recall that the standard way to find the rest mass of a nucleus is to use the atomic mass. The atomic mass of Li-6 is known, and from that, we can calculate the nuclear mass, but wait, Li atoms have an electron cloud as well. Hmm, this might complicate things.

Alternatively, since the nucleus is moving and we're considering its relativistic energy, perhaps the problem is approximating the mass as that of a single nucleon? Or maybe the nucleus is treated as a single particle with its own rest mass.

Wait, no. The nucleus is a collection of nucleons. The rest mass would be the sum of the rest masses of the nucleons minus the binding energy. But for a rough calculation, maybe we can use the approximate value. Alternatively, perhaps the problem provides the mass of the nucleus, but in this case, the question doesn't give any specific data, so I might need to find the mass of the Li-6 nucleus.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects me to use the mass of a nucleon (proton or neutron) as an approximation. Let me check: a proton has a rest mass of about 938 MeV/c², and a neutron is slightly less, about 939 MeV/c². Since Li-6 has 3 protons and 3 neutrons, the total would be roughly 3*(938 + 939)/2 ≈ 3*938.5 = 2815.5 MeV. But wait, that's just the sum. But the actual nuclear mass is a bit less because of the binding energy.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem gives the mass somewhere, but since it's not provided, I'm a bit stuck. Wait, maybe I should proceed with the formula, assuming that I can calculate gamma.

Wait, the speed is given as v=0.96c
