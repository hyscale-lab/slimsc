Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem to solve, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through step by step. Let me read the question again to make sure I understand what's being asked.

The question is about identifying an unknown compound using FTIR, 1H NMR, and Mass Spectrometry data. The options given are four different chemical formulas, so I need to figure out which one matches the spectral data.

Alright, let's break down each piece of data.

First, the FTIR spectrum. It shows a very broad absorption around 3000 cm⁻¹. Broad peaks in that region usually indicate O-H stretching. So, this suggests the compound has an -OH group. But wait, what about the other peaks? There are strong peaks at 1700 and 1650. Hmm. 1700 is typically a carbonyl (C=O) stretch, like in a ketone, aldehyde, or maybe an ester or carboxylic acid. The 1650 might be another carbonyl group or maybe an aromatic ring with conjugation, like in an aromatic ketone or an amide. But since the other peak is at 1700, maybe it's a conjugated carbonyl. Alternatively, maybe one is a ketone and another is an ester. Wait, but esters typically have a carbonyl around 1740 or so. Oh wait, but if it's conjugated, maybe the carbonyl is lower. Or perhaps it's a carboxylic acid, but their O-H would show a very broad peak around 2500-3300, but maybe that's getting confused with the broad peak at 3000. Wait, the initial peak is very broad at 3000. Could that be from an -OH group or maybe an alcohol or maybe a carboxylic acid?

Wait, another possibility: maybe the compound isn't a carboxylic acid but an ester. Esters have C=O but no O-H except maybe in the alcohol part if it's an ester from a diol or something. Alternatively, maybe it's a conjugated carbonyl, like in a ketone with adjacent double bonds.

Wait, the NMR part says there are peaks corresponding to vinyl hydrogens. Vinyl hydrogens are the ones on a double bond, right? So that suggests the compound has a double bond. And the presence of a carbonyl group might imply an alpha, beta-unsaturated carbonyl, which is conjugated. That would explain the peaks at 1700 and 1650. For example, in an α,β-unsaturated ketone, the carbonyl is at around 1700, and the conjugated double bond might have a peak at around 1650. Or wait, maybe the 1650 is an aromatic ring's C=C stretching. If that's the case, the 1700 could be a carbonyl, like in an aromatic ketone. But the presence of vinyl hydrogens in the NMR suggests a double bond, which could be either aliphatic or aromatic. But aromatic protons would typically show up downfield in the NMR, but the question doesn't give specific NMR info beyond the presence of vinyl hydrogens.

Then the mass spectrum has a fragment peak at m/z=45. Hmm, what ions have a mass of 45? Well, 45 is the molecular weight of CH3OCH2O-? Wait, no. Let's think about possible fragments. 45 could be the CH2O group, like formaldehyde? No, formaldehyde is 30. Or maybe a fragment like CH3CO-? Wait, CH3CO has a molecular weight of 43. Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the fragment is CH2OCH3? No, that's more than 45. Or maybe the fragment is something like (CH2)2O—no, that's 44. Alternatively, could it be a methyl group with something else? Wait, 45 is 45. Let's calculate: 45 = 12 * C + 1 * H + 16 * O. Let me see, possible combinations. 3 carbons would be 36. So 45 -36 =9, which is H and O. For example, CH3CO- would be C2H3O, which is 43. Not 45. Wait, another option: maybe an ethyl group with an oxygen. Like OCH2CH3 (which is ethyl ether, 45? Let's calculate: O is 16, CH2CH3 is 15 (12*2 +5)=29? No, O is 16, CH2CH3 is 15? 16+15=31. Hmm, that's not 45. Alternatively, maybe a ketene fragment or something else. Alternatively, perhaps the fragment is C3H7O. Let me see: C3 is 36, H7 is 7, O is 16. So 36+7+16=60. No, that's higher. Alternatively, maybe CO plus something else. Wait, perhaps the fragment is (CH3)2CO (acetone), which is 58. No, that's not 45. Hmm, maybe it's the fragment that comes from a ketone group. Wait, maybe the base peak is at m/z=45, which could correspond to a common fragment. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe the molecular ion is at 45, but that would mean the molecular formula would be C3H6O or something else. Wait, but the options given have higher molecular weights. Let me think of the options.

The options are:

A) C6H12O2 → molecular weight is (6*12) +12 + (2*16) → 72 +12 +32= 116.

B) C6H10O → 72 +10 +16=98.

C) C6H10O2 →72+10+32=114.

D) C6H12O →72 +12 +16=100.

So, the molecular ion would be at 100, 98, 116, or 114. But the mass spectrum shows a fragment at 45, which is half of some of these. Let's see. 45 is approximately half of 90, but none of the options have a molecular weight of 90. Wait, but 45 is exactly half of 90, but perhaps the fragment is a smaller piece. Alternatively, maybe the fragment corresponds to a functional group. For example, a common fragment in mass spectrometry is the tropylium ion (C7H7+), but that's 91. Not matching 45.

Wait, 45 could be the molecular weight of (CH3)2CO, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps it's the molecular weight of a ketone group or an ester group. Wait, another thought: 45 is the molecular weight of CH3CHO (acetaldehyde), which is 44 (12+2 +12+16+1= 44). Hmm, not quite. Wait, CH3COOH (acetic acid) is 60. Hmm, maybe it's a fragment of a larger molecule. Alternatively, perhaps it's
