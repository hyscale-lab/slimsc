Okay, so I'm trying to solve this chemistry problem. Let me read it again and think through each part step by step.

The question describes a reaction involving Substance X and liquid Y. The reaction is violent, releasing gas W and forming precipitate G. When G is heated, it releases B, which has a melting point close to 277 K. That's about 4 degrees Celsius, right? I remember that water freezes at 273 K, which is 0°C, so 277 is just a bit above that. Hmm, maybe B is something like ice? Wait, but ice's melting point is 273 K. Wait, but if B's melting point is close to 277 K, that's maybe 4°C. So B could be something else. Alternatively, maybe I'm thinking of the wrong substance.

The product of X reacting with a keto acid has two oxygen atoms. X is used in organic chemistry as a reagent, and its analog is also used. So I'm thinking maybe X is something like a strong base or a reagent that's commonly used in reactions like saponification or maybe something else.

Wait, the problem says that Substance X incorporates a heavier isotope of one of its elements. So X consists of isotopes, implying it's a compound with elements that have isotopes present. But when considering the cumulative atomic masses, I need to sum all the lightest and the heaviest elements in X.

Let me think about the reactions. X reacts with Y (liquid) violently, releasing gas W. W's molecule has the same number of neutrons and protons. So the gas W's formula must have equal protons and neutrons. Let's think about possible gases. For example, H2O has 8 protons in oxygen but more neutrons. Wait, no—each molecule has the same number of protons and neutrons. So let's think: for a molecule, the total protons and total neutrons are equal. Let's say the molecule is H2O: each H has 1 proton, O has 8. So total protons: 2*1 +8=10. Neutrons: for H, 0 (assuming protium), and O has 8. So 2*(0) +8=8. So 10 vs 8—doesn't match. Hmm. What about CO2? C has 6 protons, O has 8. So each CO2 molecule has 6 + 2*8=22 protons. Neutrons: C has 6, O has 8 each. So 6 +
