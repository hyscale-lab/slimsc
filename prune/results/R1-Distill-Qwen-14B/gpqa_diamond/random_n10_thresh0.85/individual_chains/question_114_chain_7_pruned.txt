Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm supposed to figure out the right reagents for two reactions. Let's see what the question says.

The first reaction is butan-2-one reacting with NaCN and reagent A to give 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. The second reaction takes 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile and reagent B (which is H2O) to produce 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid. The options are A to D, each with different combinations for A and B.

Hmm, starting with the first reaction. Butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO, right? And NaCN is sodium cyanide. I remember that when ketones react with cyanide, it's a nucleophilic addition. So the general reaction is ketone + CN- → cyanohydrin. Wait, a cyanohydrin is when a hydroxyl and a cyano group are added to the carbonyl carbon. So butan-2-one would form (CH3)2C(OH)CN, which is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. That makes sense.

But what reagent provides the CN- and maybe helps with the reaction? NaCN is the source of CN-, but sometimes other conditions are needed. Oh wait, I think in such reactions, the ketone might undergo addition with CN- in an acidic medium. Because the mechanism typically involves the attack of the cyanide on the carbonyl, but maybe the carbonyl needs to be protonated first. So the reagent A could be something that provides the acidic conditions, like H3O+ (which is H+ from an acid like H2SO4 or HCl). Alternatively, maybe something else.

Wait, but sometimes HCN is used with a catalyst, or maybe a strong acid like H2SO4. Alternatively, sometimes a base is used, but I think for cyanohydrin formation, the reaction is usually done with dilute acid. So the first step is likely an acid-catalyzed addition of CN-.

So reagent A in the first reaction is probably H3O+ (like option A or B). But let me think: what's the role of A and B in the reactions.

Looking at the second reaction: the starting material is a nitrile (the nitrile group is CN) attached to a 2-hydroxybutane structure. So the molecule is 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile. So when this reacts with reagent B, which is H2O, it becomes the corresponding acid: 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid. 

Wait, so the nitrile group is turning into a carboxylic acid. How does that happen? Oh, I remember that nitriles can be hydrolyzed under acidic or basic conditions to form carboxylic acids. The typical conditions for this are either strong acid (like HCl) with heat, or in the presence of a base like NaOH followed by acid work-up.

In this case, since B is H2O, but probably with some acid or base. Wait, the reaction is written as 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile + B (H2O) → ... So B is H2O, but maybe the reaction uses H2O along with an acid or base as a catalyst.

Wait, but the question states that B is H2O, but the reagent is B. So the second reaction uses B, which is either HCl or CH3COOH or something else. So, the second step is hydrolysis of the nitrile to a carboxylic acid. For that, I think we need strong acidic conditions. So the
