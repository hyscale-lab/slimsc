Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I need to figure it out. Let's see what it's about. The question is about exoplanets detected using the radial velocity (RV) method. Hmm, I remember that the RV method measures the Doppler shift in the star's spectrum caused by the planet's gravitational pull. So, the star moves a little, and we can detect that through shifts in its spectral lines.

The problem says there are two stars with exactly the same masses, similar to the Sun. Each has a planet with a mass similar to Neptune. Both planets are in circular orbits. The RV method detected each planet, and the shifts in their spectral lines are given: 5 milliangstroms for planet #1 and 7 milliangstroms for planet #2.

The question is asking how many times longer the orbital period of planet #2 is compared to planet #1. So, the ratio of P2 to P1.

Wait, I need to figure out the connection between the RV shift and the orbital period. I remember that the RV method measures the velocity of the star, which is related to the planet's orbit. The formula for the velocity semi-amplitude K is important here. K is the maximum velocity of the star due to the planet.

The formula for K is K = ( (G * (M_p) ) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(1/3) * (1 - e²)^(0.5) ) ) )^(1/3) * (1 / (2π)) )^(1/3) ). Oh wait, but since M_p is much less than M_star (like Neptune is way smaller than the Sun), we can approximate M_star + M_p ≈ M_star. So, the formula simplifies.

Alternatively, I think there's a simpler version when the planet's mass is much smaller than the star's. So, K is proportional to (M_p / M_star)^(1/3) * (1 / (P * (1 - e²)^(0.5)) ))^(1/3). But wait, since the orbits are circular, e=0, so that term goes away. So, K is proportional to ( (M_p) / (M_star) )^(1/3) * (1 / P )^(1/3) ) multiplied by some constants involving G and all.

Wait, maybe I should think of it in terms of the RV semi-amplitude formula. The formula I remember is K = ( (2π G) / (c) )^(1/3) * ( (M_p sin i) ) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(2/3) * (1 - e²)^(0.5) * (P)^(1/3) ) )

But since M_p << M_star, M_star + M_p ≈ M_star, and e=0, sin i is approximately 1 (since the orbits are edge-on as far as we can detect; but the problem doesn't specify, so I guess we can assume i=90 degrees for both, so sin i =1.)

So the equation simplifies to K ≈ ( (2π G)^(1/3) ) / (c^(1/3) ) ) * (M_p ) / ( M_star^(2/3) ) * 1/( P^(1/3) )

Wait, let me rewrite that. Actually, the exact formula is a bit more precise. The semi-amplitude K is given by:

K = (v) = ( (G * P )^(1/3) * (M_p sin i) ) / ( 2π c (M_star + M_p)^(2/3) ) )

But since M_p << M_star, M_star + M_p ≈ M_star, so:

K ≈ ( (G P )^(1/3) (M_p sin i) ) / ( 2 π c M_star^(2/3) )

Wait, but I think in terms of scaling, perhaps I can relate the velocities K1 and K2 for the two planets.

So, planet #1 has K1 = 5 milliangstroms, planet #2 has K2=7 milliangstroms. Wait, wait no, wait, wait. Wait, the problem says the periodic shift was 5 and 7 milliangstroms. So the RV semi-amplitude is proportional to the velocity of the star, which is K.

Wait, but wait, the RV shift is in wavelength, not velocity. Oh right! The Doppler shift is measured in terms of wavelength shift, which can be converted to velocity using the formula Δλ/λ = v/c, where c is the speed of light.

So, the actual velocities (K in velocity units) would be K = (Δλ / λ) * c. But wait, the problem gives the shifts as 5 and 7 milliangstrom. Let's denote λ as the wavelength. So, Δλ is 5 milliangstrom for planet #1, and 7 for planet #2.

But the actual velocity would be proportional to Δλ, since λ is the same for the same spectral line (assuming same instrument, same wavelength observed). So, the velocity shift K is proportional to Δλ. So, K1 = 5 (milliangstrom), K2=7. So K2/K1 = 7/5 = 1.4.

But wait, let me think again. The velocity shift depends on the Doppler shift. So, Δλ/λ = v/c. So, v is proportional to Δλ. So if K1 is 5 and K2 is7, the velocities are in the ratio 7:5.

But wait, in the RV method, the semi-amplitude K (velocity) is what's measured. So, K is proportional to (M_p sin i) / ( M_star^(2/3) P^(1/3) ) )^(1/1), but wait, I might have to get the exact relation.

Wait, let's get the formula correct. The RV semi-amplitude K is given by:

K = [ (G * (M_p) ) / ( (M_star + M_p) )^(1/3) ) ]^(1/3) * [1/(P)^(1/3) ) ] * [1/(2π)]^(1/3) ) / c^(1/3) ) 

Wait, no, maybe I should use the simplified version: K is proportional to (M_p sin i) / ( (M_star)^(2/3) P^(1/3) ) )

Wait, perhaps it's better to write the formula as:

K = ( (G * M_p )^(1/3) ) * ( 1 / ( (M_star + M_p)^(2/3) ) ) ) * ( 1 / (P^(1/3)) ) ) * (1/(2π))^(1/3) ) / c^(1/3) )

But given that M_p is much less than M_star, this simplifies to K = ( ( G M_p )^(1/3) ) / ( (M_star)^(2/3) ) ) * (1/(2π c^(1/3) P^(1/3) )) )

Wait, perhaps I can write K in terms of P and M_p.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to relate K to the velocity of the star, which is inversely proportional to the cube root of the orbital period. Let me see.

Wait, the formula I found online earlier (from memory) is:

K = ( ( (G * P )^(1/3) ) * ( M_p sin i ) ) / ( 2π c (M_star + M_p )^(2/3) ) )

But since M_p is much smaller, M_star + M_p ≈ M_star.

So, K ≈ ( (G P )^(1/3) M_p ) / ( 2 π c M_star^(2/3) ) )

So, K is proportional to M_p / ( M_star^(2/3) ) * (1/P^(1/3) )

But wait, in our problem, both stars have the same mass (M_star), and both planets have masses similar to Neptune. So M_p is the same for both planets. So, M_p is same, M_star same, so K is inversely proportional to cube root of P.

So, K ∝ 1 / P^(1/3). So, for planet #1, K1 = 5, planet #2, K2=7.

So, K2/K1 = (1/P2^(1/3)) / (1/P1^(1/3)) ) = (P1/P2)^(1/3) )

Wait, because K is inversely proportional to P^(1/3): K ∝ 1/P^(1/3)

So, K1 / K2 = (P2^(1/3) ) / ( P1^(1/3) )

So, (K2/K1) = (P1/P2)^(1/3)

We need to find (P2 / P1). Let me denote x = P2/P1. So, K2/K1 = (1/x)^(1/3) = (1/x)^(1/3) = (1/x^(1/3)).

So, K2/K1 = 7/5 = 1.4 = (1/x)^(1/3)

But wait, we have K2 is larger than K1, which implies that K2 is inversely proportional to P2^(1/3). So, if K2 is larger than K1, then P2 must be smaller than P1. Because a larger K corresponds to a smaller period.

Wait, but wait, the question is asking how many times longer is P2 than P1. So, if P2 is larger, the ratio would be greater than 1. But with K2 being larger, from K ∝ 1/P^(1/3), that would mean P is smaller.

Wait, so let's correct the earlier steps.

So, K is inversely proportional to P^(1/3). So, higher K means smaller period.

So, K2 > K1 → P2 < P1.

So, the ratio P2/P1 = (K1/K2)^3.

Because K ∝ 1/P^(1/3), so K1/K2 = (P2/P1)^(1/3 )

So, (K1/K2) = (P2/P1)^(1/3 )

So, (P2/P1) = (K1/K2)^3

So, P2/P1 = (5/7)^3 = (25/49) = approximately 0.51.

Wait, 5/7 is about 0.714, so cube is (0.714)^3 ≈ 0.364.

Wait, 0.714 * 0.714 = 0.51, then 0.51 * 0.714 ≈ 0.364. So, 0.364.

So, P2 is about 0.364 times P1. So, the orbital period of planet #2 is about 0.36 times that of planet #1. So, it's 0.36 times, meaning it's shorter. So, the question is, how many times longer is P2 than P1? Well, if P2 is 0.36 times P1, then it's shorter, so the answer would be 0.36 times, meaning P2 is 0.36 times as long as P1. So, the ratio P2/P1 is 0.36.

Wait, but wait, the options are:

A) ~0.36

B) ~1.40

C) ~1.96

D) ~0.85

So, the ratio is 0.36, so option A is ~0.36.

But wait, let me double-check the steps because I might have made a mistake.

We have K = (something) / (P^(1/3))

So, K is inversely proportional to P^(1/3).

So, K2 = (something) / (P2^(1/3) )

K1 = (something) / (P1^(1/3) )

So, K2/K1 = (P1^(1/3)) / (P2^(1/3)) )

So, (K2/K1) = (P1/P2)^(1/3 )

So, (P1/P2) = (K2/K1)^3

Thus, P1 = (K2/K1)^3 * P2

Wait, but the question is P2/P1, which is the reciprocal.

So, P2/P1 = (K1/K2)^3

Which is (5/7)^3 ≈ 125 / 343 ≈ 0.364.

So, the answer is 0.364 times. Which is about 0.36.

So, the correct option is A.


The problem involves determining how many times longer the orbital period of planet #2 is compared to planet #1, given that both planets were detected using the radial velocity (RV) method. The RV semi-amplitude \( K \), which is proportional to the velocity shift of the star's spectral line, is inversely proportional to the cube root of the orbital period \( P \). Mathematically, \( K \propto 1/P^{1/3} \).

For planet #1, the RV shift corresponds to a semi-amplitude \( K_1 = 5 \, \text{milliangstroms} \), and for planet #2, \( K_2 = 7 \, \text{milliangstroms} \). Since \( K \propto 1/P^{1/3} \), the ratio of the periods \( P_2/P_1 \) can be expressed as:

\[
P_2/P_1 = \left(\frac{K_1}{K_2}\right)^3
\]

Substituting the given values:

\[
P_2/P_1 = \left(\frac{5}{7}\right)^3
\]

Calculating this:

\[
\left(\frac{5}{7}\right)^3 = \frac{125}{343} \approx 0.364
\]

Thus, the orbital period of planet #2 is approximately 0.36 times that of planet #1. This means planet #2 has a shorter orbital period than planet #1.

From the options provided:

- **A) ~0.36**: Matches the calculated ratio.
- **B) ~1.40**: Incorrect, as it represents the ratio of \( K_2/K_1 \), not the period ratio.
- **C) ~1.96**: Incorrect, as it does not align with the derived relationship.
- **D) ~0.85**: Incorrect, as it is not consistent with the calculation.

The correct answer is **A**, as the ratio \( P_2/P_1 \) is approximately 0.36.

Answer: A
