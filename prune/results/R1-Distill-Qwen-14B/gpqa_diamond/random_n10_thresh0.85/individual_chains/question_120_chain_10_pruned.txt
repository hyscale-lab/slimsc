Okay, so I've got this question about stars and their distribution in the sky. Hmm, the question says that stars are uniformly distributed, which probably means their density is the same throughout space, right? But wait, I'm not entirely sure what uniform distribution implies here. Maybe it's about the same number per volume unit, regardless of distance.

The question is asking how the number of stars per unit range of parallax (plx) changes with plx. Parallax is the apparent shift in position of a star as observed from Earth due to our orbit around the Sun. I remember that parallax is inversely related to distance. So, the closer the star, the larger the parallax. Like, plx = 1/distance in parsecs or something.

Wait, the formula I'm trying to recall is that the distance d in parsecs is the reciprocal of the parallax, so d = 1/plx. Oh right, that's correct. So if a star has a parallax of 1 arcsecond, it's 1 parsec away. And as plx decreases, the distance increases.

Now, the number of stars per unit range of plx. I think this relates to how the density of stars changes with distance. But the problem states that stars are uniformly distributed, meaning their spatial density (number per volume) is constant, right? So n(r) is constant, but when we look in terms of parallax, the distribution might change.

Let me think about the volume in terms of distance. Volume is a three-dimensional measure. So, for a spherical shell at radius r with thickness dr, the volume would be 4π r² dr. Because the volume between r and r+dr is a thin shell, and its volume is 4π r² dr.

But since parallax plx is 1/r (because r is in parsecs?), so r = 1/plx. So dr = - (1/plx²) dplx. Wait, maybe I should make a substitution.

Let me set r = 1/plx. So, plx = 1/r. The differential dr would be the change in distance when plx changes by a small amount dplx. So, dr = - (1/(plx)^2) dplx. The negative sign indicates that as plx increases, r decreases, but for the purposes of volume, I can consider the magnitude.

So, the volume element in terms of plx would be 4π (r)^2 dr. Substituting r=1/plx, dr = (1/plx²) dplx (ignoring the negative because we're considering small intervals). So,

dV = 4π (1/plx)^2 * (1/plx²) dplx )?

Wait, wait, that would be 4π (1/plx)^2 * (d r), which is (1/plx^2) * (1/plx^2) dplx? Hmm, perhaps I should compute dr in terms of dplx.

Wait, let me do this substitution step by step.

We have plx = 1/r. So, dplx = - (1/r²) dr. So, dr = - r² dplx. Since r = 1/plx, then dr = - (1/plx)^2 dplx.

Now, the volume element dV is 4π r² dr. Substituting r = 1/plx, and dr = -(1/plx²) dplx, we get:

dV = 4π (1/plx)^2 * (-1/plx²) dplx )

Wait, but the negative just indicates direction, so for the magnitude, we can ignore it. So,

dV = 4π (1/plx^2) * (1/plx^2) dplx ) ?

Wait, that would be 4π (1/plx^4) dplx. Wait, no, wait:  (1/plx)^2 is (1/plx^2), and dr is (1/plx^2) dplx. So,

dV = 4π (1/plx²) * (1/plx²) dplx ) 

Which is 4π (1/plx^4) dplx.

Wait, but I'm trying to find the number of stars per unit range of plx. So, the number of stars in a small range of plx around plx is the number density multiplied by the volume. Since the number density is uniform, let's say n (number per volume), then the number of stars in dplx is n * dV.

So, number = n * dV = n * (4π / plx^4) dplx.

Wait, but the question is about the number per unit plx, which would be (number of stars) / (dplx). So, the number per unit plx is (n * 4π) / plx^4.

So, the number of stars per unit range of plx is proportional to 1/plx^4.

Wait, but I'm looking at the options. Option A is
