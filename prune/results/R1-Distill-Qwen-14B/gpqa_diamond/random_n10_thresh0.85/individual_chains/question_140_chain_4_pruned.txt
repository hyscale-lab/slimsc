Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem in front of me. It's a bit tricky, but I'll try to break it down step by step. Let me read through it again and see what I can figure out.

The question is about a substance X that reacts violently with liquid Y, releasing a gas W. The gas W's molecule has the same number of neutrons and protons. Then a precipitate G forms, which when heated releases B. The melting point of B is close to 277 K. Another clue is that the product of a keto acid reacting with X has two oxygen atoms. Also, X and its analog are used as reagents in organic chemistry. We need to find the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements in X.

Hmm. Let me think about each clue.

First, gas W's molecule has same protons and neutrons. So, the number of protons equals the number of neutrons. That's a key point. What molecules satisfy that? Well, for instance, O2 has 8 protons each, so 16 total. But that's 16 protons and 16 neutrons? Wait, wait, no. Each O atom has 8 protons and 8 neutrons (in the common isotope). So O2 would have 16 protons and 16 neutrons. So same. So O2 is a possibility. But wait, maybe another gas.

Wait, another possibility is H2O. But H2O is a liquid under standard conditions, not a gas. So nope. Another thought: maybe CO2? Let's see, each C has 6 protons, 6+8=14 neutrons? Wait, no, for a molecule, the total protons and total neutrons. Let me think: For CO2, there's 1 C and 2 O. C has 6 protons; O has 8 each. So total protons: 6 + 2*8=22. Neutrons: C is 6 (if C-12), O is 8 each (if O-16). So total neutrons: 6 + 2*8=22. Oh wait, that's same as protons. So CO2 would have 22 protons and 22 neutrons. So that's possible. But CO2 is a gas, right? At standard conditions, it's a gas. Oh wait, but CO2 is a gas but under certain conditions it's a solid, but I think the question refers to the gas released. So maybe W is CO2.

Another possibility: Maybe it's something like CH4, but wait, CH4 has 6 protons (from C) + 4*1=4, total protons 10. Neutrons: C-12 has 6, H has 0, so total neutrons 6. 10 protons vs 6 neutronsâ€”no match. So that's not it.

Wait, maybe it's O3? Ozone. Each O is 8 protons. So 3 O atoms: 24 protons. Neutrons: Each O-16 has 8, so 24 neutrons. So that's same as protons. But O3 is a form of oxygen, so that's possible. But O3 isn't a gas under all conditions. At STP, O3 is a blue gas, but maybe. Alternatively, maybe it's O2.

But let me think again. If W is CO2, then
