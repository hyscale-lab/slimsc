Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about cobalt complexes and stability constants. Hmm, I think I remember that stability constants (beta) indicate how stable a complex is. The higher the beta, the more stable the complex. 

The question is asking about the percentage of blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes among all the cobalt species. The options are given, and I need to calculate it.

Wait, what's the structure here? Cobalt can form different complexes with thiocyanate ions. The complexes are [Co(SCN)_n]^m+ where n is the number of SCN- ligands attached. Each complex has a different stability constant beta.

The stability constants given are beta1=9 (for n=1?), beta2=40 (n=2), beta3=63 (n=3), beta4=16 (n=4). Wait, but wait, I'm a bit confused. Because sometimes the order of the stability constants depends on the order of the complexes. Maybe beta1 is for the first complex, which is [Co(SCN)]^2+, beta2 is [Co(SCN)2]^0, and so on.

Wait, no, the stability constant increases with the number of ligands. Wait, beta3 is 63, which is higher than beta2's 40, so the third complex is more stable than the second? Or wait, no, for each step, the formation of the next complex is governed by the beta value. So the overall stability for each complex is the product of the stepwise beta values up to that point. 

Wait, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Let me think. The stability constant for a complex with n ligands is the product of the stepwise beta constants from 1 to n. So for [Co(SCN)_2]^2+, the stability would be beta1 * beta2. Similarly, [Co(SCN)_3] would have beta1*beta2*beta3, and so on.

Wait, but in the problem, the beta values are given as beta1=9, beta2=40, beta3=63, beta4=16. So each beta represents the formation of the next complex from the previous one. So, the overall stability constants for each complex would be:

- [Co(SCN)]^2+ : beta1 =9
- [Co(SCN)2]^0 : beta1*beta2= 9*40=360
- [Co(SCN)3]^– : beta1*beta2*beta3=9*40*63=22680
- [Co(SCN)4]^2–: beta1*beta2*beta3*beta4=22680 *16= 362880.

Wait, but the question is about the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato complex. Dithiocyanato is with two SCN- ligands, right? Because di means two. So that's [Co(SCN)2]^0. So the blue complex is the one with two ligands.

So to find the percentage of this complex, I need to calculate the fraction of [Co(SCN)2]^0 among all possible Co species. The possible species include the free Co^2+ ion and all the complexes from n=1 to n=4. But perhaps the four complexes are [Co(SCN)]^2+, [Co(SCN)2]^0, [Co(SCN)3]^–, and [Co(SCN)4]^2–.

Wait, but how do we account for all the species? I'm a bit rusty on this, but I think the distribution of metal complexes in solution can be found using the stability constants and the concentrations of the ligand and metal.

The general approach is to consider all possible complexes and their concentrations. The fraction of each complex is determined by the product of the stability constant for that complex and the ligand concentration raised to the power of the number of ligands, divided by the sum of all such terms for all possible complexes.

Wait, more precisely, the fraction fi of each complex [Co(SCN)_i]^n is given by (beta_i * [SCN^-]^i) / (sum over j of beta_j * [SCN^-]^j ), where j ranges from 0 to the maximum possible ligands. Wait, but the metal's initial concentration is given as c(Co) =1e-2 M, and [SCN
