Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about light passing through moving glass. Hmm, I remember from my classes that when light moves through a medium, its speed changes based on the refractive index. But wait, the glass is moving too, so I have to consider that in the problem.

The question is asking for the speed of light in the glass relative to the observer in the lab. The setup is that the glass is moving at a constant velocity v in the same direction as the light beam and towards the observer. Oh wait, no, wait. Wait, the glass is moving toward the observer, but in the same direction as the beam. So the beam is going toward the observer, and the glass is moving in the same direction, meaning it's moving toward the observer as well?

I think I should break this down. The speed of light in the glass when the glass is stationary is c/n, where c is the speed of light in a vacuum and n is the refractive index. But since the glass is moving, things get more complicated because of relativity, right?

But wait, the problem says the glass is moving at a constant velocity. That suggests maybe we're supposed to use classical mechanics or perhaps special relativity? Hmm. Let me think. The speeds involved here are probably non-relativistic, but I'm not sure. The options given don't involve any square roots or gamma factors, so maybe it's a classical approach.

In classical terms, when a medium is moving, the speed of light in the medium as observed from the lab frame would be the speed of the light in the medium plus the speed of the medium. Because velocities add in Galilean
