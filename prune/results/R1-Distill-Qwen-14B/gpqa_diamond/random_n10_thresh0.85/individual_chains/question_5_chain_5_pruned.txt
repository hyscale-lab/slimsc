Okay, I've got this quantum mechanics problem in front of me. Let me take a deep breath and try to figure it out step by step. So the question is about finding the eigenvector of a quantum mechanical operator P along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane corresponding to the eigenvalue +ħ/2.

Hmm. Alright, let's break this down. The operator P is given in terms of its components P_x, P_y, and P_z. Each of these is a 2x2 matrix multiplied by ħ/2. 

First, I remember that the operator P is likely the Pauli vector, which is used in spin systems. The Pauli vector components are σ_x, σ_y, σ_z multiplied by ħ/2. So P is the spin operator for a muon, which is like an electron but heavier.

The direction n is in the x-z plane, so that means the direction vector has components (n_x, 0, n_z), right? Because in the x-z plane, the y-component is zero. So the unit vector n would be (n_x, 0, n_z), and it's normalized, so n_x^2 + n_z^2 = 1.

The eigenvector we're looking for is the eigenstate of the operator P along direction n with eigenvalue +ħ/2. So the operator P·n would have this eigenvector. 

Wait, P·n would be the sum of each component multiplied by the corresponding n component. So P·n = n_x P_x + n_z P_z, because n_y is zero. 

Wait, no. Wait, the operator is P = n_x P_x + n_y P_y + n_z P_z. But since n is in the x-z plane, n_y is zero. So P·n = n_x P_x + n_z P_z.

But the eigenvalue is +ħ/2, so we're solving (P·n) |ψ> = (ħ/2) |ψ>.

So I need to find the eigenvectors of the matrix (n_x P_x + n_z P_z) corresponding to eigenvalue ħ/2.

Wait, but P_x, P_y, P_z are given. Let me write down each component.

P_x is (ħ/2) times [[0, 1], [1, 0]]
P_y is (ħ/2) times [[0, -i], [i, 0]]
P_z is (ħ/2) times [[1, 0], [0, -1]]

So the operator P·n will be (n_x)*(P_x) + (n_z)*(P_z).

So substituting the matrices:

P·n = (n_x)(ħ/2) [[0,1],[1,0]] + (n_z)(ħ/2) [[1,0],[0,-1]]

Factor out (ħ/2):

P·n = (ħ/2) [ [n_z, n_x], [n_x, -n_z] ]

So the matrix is:

[ [n_z, n_x],
  [n_x, -n_z] ]

Wait, no, wait. Let me compute each element:

First term when n_x is multiplied by P_x matrix:

n_x * (ħ/2) * 0 in (1,1) → 0
n_x * (ħ/2) * 1 in (1,2) → n_x ħ/2
n_x * (ħ/2) * 1 in (2,1) → n_x ħ/2
n_x * (ħ/2) * 0 in (2,2) → 0.

Similarly, for P_z:

n_z * (ħ/2) * 1 → (n_z ħ/2) in (1,1)
n_z * (ħ/2)*0 → 0 in (1,2)
n_z * (ħ/2)*0 → 0 in (2,1)
n_z * (ħ/2)*(-1) → -n_z ħ/2 in (2,2)

So adding these terms:

(1,1): n_z ħ/2
(1,2): n_x ħ/2
(2,1): n_x ħ/2
(2,2): -n_z ħ/2

So the matrix is:

[ [n_z ħ/2, n_x ħ/2],
  [n_x ħ/2, -n_z ħ/2] ]

Wait, but since we're considering the operator P·n, which is (ħ/2)(n_z σ_z + n_x σ_x), because σ_x, σ_y, σ_z are the Pauli matrices. So actually, the matrix is (ħ/2) (n_z σ_z + n_x σ_x), which can be written as (ħ/2) times [σ·n], where σ is the vector of Pauli matrices.

But perhaps I should proceed to find the eigenvectors.

The eigenvalue equation is:

(P·n) |ψ> = (ħ/2) |ψ>

Wait, no. Wait, the eigenvalue is +ħ/2, so equation is:

(P·n) |ψ> = (ħ/2) |ψ>

So the matrix P·n is (ħ/2) multiplied by [n_z σ_z + n_x σ_x]. So when I write the matrix equation, it's (ħ/2)(n_z σ_z + n_x σ_x) |ψ> = (ħ/2) |ψ>

Divide both sides by ħ/2:

(n_z σ_z + n_x σ_x) |ψ> = |ψ>

So the matrix (n_z σ_z + n_x σ_x) has to have eigenvalue 1 for the given |ψ>.

Alternatively, the matrix (n_z σ_z + n_x σ_x) has eigenvalues ±1, since the Pauli matrices have eigenvalues ±1 when multiplied by real coefficients.

Wait, another approach: the eigenstates of σ·n, where n is a unit vector, are the spin-up and spin-down states along n. So the eigenstates are given in terms of the angles θ and φ defining the direction n.

Since n is in the x-z plane, the direction can be expressed using polar coordinates where the angle φ is zero (
