Okay, so I've got this question about exoplanet transits and which planet is more likely to transit from our point of view. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's think it through.

The question says that there are two planets, Planet_1 and Planet_2. Both have been detected via the radial velocity (RV) method, so we know their minimum masses and orbital periods. They share the same mass, but Planet_1 has a shorter orbital period. Specifically, Planet_1's period is three times shorter than Planet_2's. So if Planet_2 takes, say, 100 days, Planet_1 would take about 33 days. 

Both have circular orbits, which probably simplifies things. The host stars are different: Planet_1's star is more massive, twice as much as Planet_2's. But both stars have the same radius, which is a bit interesting. I remember that more massive stars are usually larger, but maybe in this case, Planet_2's star is slightly evolved, so it's expanded a bit, making them the same size despite the mass difference.

The main question is about the probability of a transit. I think the transit probability depends on the orbital configuration relative to our line of sight. The probability should be higher if the planet's orbit is more edge-on. But how does that relate to the planet's orbital period and the star's properties?

Wait, the transit probability is calculated based on the size of the star and the planet's orbit. The formula for the probability is roughly (R_star + R_planet) / a_planet, where a is the semi-major axis. But actually, more accurately, the probability is (R_star / a_planet) * (some factor), but I'm not exactly sure. Let me think again.

Oh right! The formula for the transit probability is (R_planet + R_star) / a, but wait, no, that's not right. Because for a circular orbit, the probability is the ratio of the star's radius to the semi-major axis. So P_transit ≈ (R_star / a) * (something else) based on inclination. Wait, no, maybe I'm mixing it up.

Wait, I think the transit probability is given by the formula P = (R*/a) * (R_p / R*) ), but I'm not certain. Hmm, perhaps I should remember that the transit probability is the area of the planet's orbit relative to the star. Oh wait, more accurately, transit probability is (R_star / a) * something else. Alternatively, I think the probability is proportional to (R_star / a), because the planet has to pass in front of the star, which depends on the star's size relative to the orbital distance.

Wait, no, perhaps the probability is given by (R_star / a) * (R_planet / R_star), but that would be something else. Alternatively, the probability is (R_star + R_planet)/a. But wait, the exact formula is tricky.

Wait, maybe I should think in terms of geometry. The probability that the planet's orbit, as seen from Earth, passes in front of the star is highest when the inclination is 90 degrees (edge-on). The probability is calculated as the ratio of the star's diameter to the diameter of the planet's orbit. So, if the orbit is a circle, the area where the planet can transit is a line across the star's disk. The probability is the ratio of the star's diameter to the orbital diameter.

Wait, more accurately, the transit probability is (R_star / a) multiplied by the solid angle. Alternatively, the transit probability is (R_star / a) multiplied by a factor that depends on the orbital distance. Oh wait, I think the correct formula is P = (R_star / a) * (1 + sqrt(1 - (b^2))), where b is the impact parameter. But wait, when orbits are randomly oriented, the average impact parameter is sqrt(a^2 - R_star^2)/a or something like that. Hmm, I'm getting a bit tangled here.

Alternatively, I remember that the transit probability is approximately (R_star / a). But wait, that doesn't make sense because if a is large, the probability would be small, which makes sense. So the probability is proportional to R_star / a.

Wait, but I think the actual formula is a bit more involved. So, the transit probability P is given by:

P = (R_star / a) * [ (1 + (R_planet / R_star)) / (sqrt(1 + e^2)) ) ]

But since both orbits are circular (e=0), and R_planet is much smaller than R_star, the term (R_planet / R_star) is negligible, so it's approximately (R_star / a) * 1.

So, P ≈ R_star / a.

But wait, in this problem, both stars have the same radius. So R1 = R2. So the probability depends inversely on the semi-major axis a.

But wait, a is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit. How is a related to the orbital period and the star's mass?

Oh, Kepler's third law comes into play. The semi-major axis a is related to the orbital period P and the mass of the star M via:

P² = (4π²/G M) * a³

So a³ = (G M P²) / (4 π²)

But let me think in terms of scaling. Since both planets have the same mass, but their orbital periods and star masses are different.

Wait, for Planet_1, P1 = P2 / 3. Because Planet_1's period is three times shorter than Planet_2's.

The host star of Planet_1 has mass M1 = 2 * M2. So M1 is twice M2.

So for each planet, a is calculated based on Kepler's law. Let's write Kepler's third law in terms of a³ proportional to (M) * (P^2), because a³ ∝ (M * P²).

So a1³ = (M1 * P1²) / (M2 * P2²) * a2³ ?

Wait, perhaps it's better to express a in terms of the formula. So,

a1³ / a2³ = (M1 / M2) * (P1² / P2²)

Given M1 = 2 M2, and P1 = P2 / 3.

So,

a1³ / a2³ = (2) * ( (P2/3)^2 / P2² ) ) = 2 * ( (P2²)/(9 P2²) ) ) = 2*(1/9) )= 2/9.

Thus, a1³ = (2/9) a2³ → a1 = a2 * (2/9)^(1/3).
