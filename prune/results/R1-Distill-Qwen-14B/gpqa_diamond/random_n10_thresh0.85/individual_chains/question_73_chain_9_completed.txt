Okay, so I have this physics problem here about two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds, and I'm supposed to find their relative speed and the total energy of the system. Hmm, I remember that when dealing with velocities close to the speed of light, I can't just use classical mechanics because that doesn't account for relativistic effects. Right, I need to use Einstein's theory of relativity here.

The astronauts have masses 2m and 3m, moving at 0.6c and 0.5c respectively in the same direction. So, the question is about their relative speed and the total energy of the system.

First, what about the relative speed? I think relative velocity in relativity isn't as straightforward as subtracting the two speeds. I recall the formula for relative velocity in special relativity: when two objects have velocities u and v relative to a rest frame, their relative velocity u' is given by (u - v)/(1 - (uv)/c²). Wait, but wait, I need to make sure which way I'm calculating it. Oh right, if both are moving in the same direction, the relative speed between them would be (u - v)/(1 - (uv)/(c²)).

Let me plug in the values. The first astronaut is moving at 0.6c, the second at 0.5c. So u is 0.6c, and v is 0.5c. So u - v is 0.1c. Then the denominator is 1 - (0.6c * 0.5c)/(c²). The c² in the denominator cancels with the numerator's c², so it's 1 - (0.3 c²)/(c²) = 1 - 0.3 = 0.7. So the relative speed is (0.1c) / 0.7 ≈ 0.1428c. Wait, that's approximately 0.14c. So looking at the options, options C and D have 0.14c as the relative speed. So that's a start.

Now for the total energy. I think the total energy of each astronaut would be their relativistic energy, which is gamma multiplied by their rest mass energy. The rest mass energy is mc² for each, so we'll have to calculate gamma for each.

Gamma is 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²). Let's compute this for each astronaut.

First astronaut: v = 0.6c. So v²/c² = 0.36. 1 - 0.36 = 0.64. sqrt(0.64) is 0.8. So gamma is 1/0.8 = 1.25. So his energy is 1.25 * 2m * c². Because his mass is 2m. So 2m * 1.25 = 2.5 mc².

Second astronaut: v = 0.5c. v²/c² is 0.25. 1 -0.25=0.75. sqrt(0.75) is approximately 0.8660. So gamma is 1/0.8660 ≈ 1.1547. So his energy is 1.1547 * 3m * c². 3 * 1.1547 is about 3.464 mc².

Now, the total energy would be the sum of both energies. So 2.5 + 3.464 = about 5.964 mc². Let me check the options again. Option C has E=5.96 mc². Option D has E=5 mc². So the numbers I got are approximately 5.96, which matches option C. Option B is 4.96, which doesn't match, so probably not.

Wait, but wait a second, the problem says "the total energy of the system." Wait, in relativity, when you have multiple objects, the total energy is just the sum of each object's energy, correct? Because each object's energy is accounted for in their own frame. So yeah, adding them seems right.

So the relative speed is 0.14c, and the total energy is around 5.96 mc². Looking at the options, option C says v_rel=0.14c and E=5.96 mc². So that's the correct option.

Wait, but let me double-check the relative velocity calculation. I used (u - v)/(1 - uv/c²). Let me see: u is 0.6c, v is 0.5c. So numerator is 0.1c. Denominator is 1 - (0.6c * 0.5c)/(c²) = 1 - 0.3 = 0.7. So 0.1 / 0.7 is approximately 0.1428, which is about 0.14c, yes. So the relative speed is correct.

So the answer should be option C.


To solve the problem, we analyze the relative speed and total energy of the system using relativistic mechanics.

### Relative Speed
The relative velocity between two objects moving in the same direction at relativistic speeds is given by the formula:

\[
v_{\text{rel}} = \frac{u - v}{1 - \frac{uv}{c^2}}
\]

Here, \( u = 0.6c \) and \( v = 0.5c \). Substituting these values:

1. **Numerator**: \( u - v = 0.6c - 0.5c = 0.1c \)
2. **Denominator**: \( 1 - \frac{uv}{c^2} = 1 - \frac{(0.6c)(0.5c)}{c^2} = 1 - 0.3 = 0.7 \)

Thus:

\[
v_{\text{rel}} = \frac{0.1c}{0.7} \approx 0.1428c \approx 0.14c
\]

This matches the relative speed in options C and D.

### Total Energy
The total energy of each astronaut is calculated using the relativistic energy formula:

\[
E = \gamma m c^2, \quad \text{where } \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}}}
\]

#### First Astronaut (\( v = 0.6c, m = 2m \)):
1. \( \frac{v^2}{c^2} = 0.36 \), so \( 1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2} = 0.64 \)
2. \( \sqrt{0.64} = 0.8 \), so \( \gamma = \frac{1}{0.8} = 1.25 \)
3. Energy: \( E_1 = 1.25 \cdot 2m \cdot c^2 = 2.5mc^2 \)

#### Second Astronaut (\( v = 0.5c, m = 3m \)):
1. \( \frac{v^2}{c^2} = 0.25 \), so \( 1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2} = 0.75 \)
2. \( \sqrt{0.75} \approx 0.866 \), so \( \gamma = \frac{1}{0.866} \approx 1.1547 \)
3. Energy: \( E_2 = 1.1547 \cdot 3m \cdot c^2 \approx 3.464mc^2 \)

#### Total Energy:
\[
E_{\text{total}} = E_1 + E_2 = 2.5mc^2 + 3.464mc^2 \approx 5.964mc^2 \approx 5.96mc^2
\]

This matches the total energy in option C.

### Final Answer
The relative speed is \( v_{\text{rel}} = 0.14c \), and the total energy is \( E = 5.96mc^2 \). Comparing with the options, the correct choice is:
