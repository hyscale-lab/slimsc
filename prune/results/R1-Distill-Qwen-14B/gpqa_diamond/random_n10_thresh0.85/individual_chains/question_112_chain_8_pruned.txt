Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. I'm a bit rusty, but let me try to think it through step by step.

The question says we have a state |alpha> described by the electron state proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>. So first, I should probably normalize this state because probabilities need to add up to 1.

Wait, the state is given as proportional, so the actual state is (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>, divided by a normalization factor. Let me compute the normalization factor. The normalization factor is the square root of the inner product of the state with itself.

The inner product is (1-i)(1+i) + (2+i)(2-i). Let's compute each part.

(1-i)(1+i) = 1^2 + (i)(-i) + i*1 + (-i)*i? Hmm, wait, no, actually, (a + b)(a* - b*) where a is 1 and b is i. Wait, maybe it's easier to compute it as (1+i)(1-i)= 1 - (i)^2 = 1 - (-1) = 2.

Wait, no, wait. The inner product is (1+i) times (1-i) plus (2-i) times (2+i), right?

Wait, no. Wait, the state is (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>, so the inner product is (1+i)(1-i) + (2-i)(2+i). Let me compute each term.

First term: (1+i)(1-i) = 1*(1) + 1*(-i) + i*(1) + i*(-i) = 1 -i +i -i². The i terms cancel, and -i² is +1, so 1+1=2.

Second term: (2-i)(2+i) = 4 +2i -2i - (i^2) = 4 - (-1) =5.

So the normalization factor squared is 2 +5=7. So the normalization is sqrt(7). So the state is (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down> divided by sqrt(7). So |alpha> = [ (1+i)|up> + (2 -i)|down> ] / sqrt(7).

Now, the next part is about measuring the eigenstates of an operator A. The matrix representation of A is given as Aij = ħ/2 if i≠j, 0 otherwise. Wait, that's a 2x2 matrix, right? Because the spin states are up and down, which are two states.

So for a 2x2 matrix, A would have 0 on the diagonal and ħ/2 off-diagonal. So matrix A is:

[ 0    ħ/2 ]
[ ħ/2  0 ]

But wait, wait. The i and j indices are for rows and columns. So in Aij, when i≠j, it's ħ/2. So the diagonal elements (i=j) are 0. So yes, the matrix looks like that.

But wait, what operator is this? Because the usual Pauli matrices have forms like [[0,1],[1,0]] or similar. So this operator A is proportional to the sigma_x operator? Let me think. The sigma_x matrix is [[0,1],[1,0]]. So if A is ħ/2 times sigma_x, because sigma_x has 1s where A has ħ/2. So A = (ħ/2) * sigma_x.

Hmm, but wait, the eigenstates of sigma_x are different from the |up> and |down> states, which are eigenstates of sigma_z. So what are the eigenstates of A? Well, since A is a multiple of sigma_x, its eigenstates are the eigenstates of sigma_x.

The eigenstates of sigma_x are the |+x> and |-x> states, which can be written as superpositions of |up> and |down>.

The eigenvalues of sigma_x are ±1, so the eigenvalues of A would be (ħ/2)(±1) → ±ħ/2.

So when the problem asks for the probability of measuring the particle in each eigenstate of operator A, I think it's asking for the probabilities of getting +ħ/2 and -ħ/2 when measuring A.

To compute the probabilities, I need to express |alpha> in terms of the eigenstates of A.

Wait, alternatively, perhaps I can find the eigenvectors of A and then find the components of |alpha> in those eigenvectors.

So, let's find the eigenstates of A. Since A is proportional to sigma_x, the eigenstates are the same as for sigma_x.

The eigenstates of sigma_x are |+x> = (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2) and |−x> = (|up> − |down>)/sqrt(2). Because sigma_x |+x> = +1 |+x>, etc.

Wait, no. Let me compute the eigenvectors. The eigenvalues of sigma_x are 1 and -1. So for sigma_x |+x> = |+x>, we have:

sigma_x |+x> = |+x> → sigma_x |+x> = |+x>.

But sigma_x is [[0,1],[1,0]], so acting on |+x>:

|+x> = (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2).

Then sigma_x |+x> = (|down> + |up>)/sqrt(2) = |+x>, so yes, correct.

Similarly, |−x> = (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2), and sigma_x |−x> = (|down> - |up>)/sqrt(2) = -|−x>, since (|down> - |up>) is - (|up> - |down>).

So the eigenstates are |+x> and |−x> as I mentioned.

So, A = (ħ/2) sigma_x. So the eigenstates of A are |+x> and |−x>, with eigenvalues ħ/2 and -ħ/2 respectively.

So, to find the probability of measuring each eigenvalue, I need to express |alpha> as a linear combination of |+x> and |−x>, and then the probabilities are the squares of the coefficients.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to compute the expectation value and other things using the basis of |alpha> expressed in the eigenstates of A.

But first, let's express |alpha> in terms of |+x> and |−x>.

The state |alpha> is [ (1+i)|up> + (2 -i)|down> ] / sqrt(7).

We can write this as:

|alpha> = (1+i)/sqrt(7) |up> + (2 -i)/sqrt(7) |down>

And the |+x> and |−x> states are:

|+x> = (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2)
|−x> = (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2)

So, to find the coefficients c_+ and c_- such that:

|alpha> = c_+ |+x> + c_- |−x>

Let me write the equations to solve for c_+ and c_-.

Express |alpha> as:

|alpha> = [ (1+i)/sqrt(7) ] |up> + [ (2 - i)/sqrt(7) ] |down>

We can express |up> and |down> in terms of |+x> and |−x>:

|up> = (|+x> + |−x>)/sqrt(2)
|down> = (|+x> - |−x>)/sqrt(2)

Substituting into |alpha>:

|alpha> = [ (1+i)/sqrt(7) ] * (|+x> + |−x>)/sqrt(2) + [ (2 - i)/sqrt(7) ] * (|+x> - |−x>)/sqrt(2)

Combine terms:

= [ (1+i)/(sqrt(7) sqrt(2)) ) (|+x> + |−x>) + (2 - i)/(sqrt(7) sqrt(2)) ) (|+x> - |−x>) ]

Factor out 1/sqrt(7*2):

= [ (1+i)(|+x> + |−x>) + (2 -i)(|+x> - |−x>) ] / sqrt(14)

Let me expand the numerator:

= [ (1+i)|+x> + (1+i)|−x> + (2-i)|+x> - (2-i)|−x> ] 

Group the |+x> and |−x> terms:

= [ ( (1+i) + (2 -i) ) |+x> + ( (1+i) - (2 -i) ) |−x> ]

Compute the coefficients:

For |+x> coefficient: (1 + i + 2 - i) = (3) → 3.

For |−x> coefficient: (1 + i -2 + i )= (-1 + 2i).

So, numerator becomes:

3 |+x> + (-1 + 2i) |−x>

So |alpha> = [3 |+x> + (-1 + 2i) |−x> ] / sqrt(14)

So the coefficients c_+ and c_- are:

c_+ = 3 / sqrt(14)

c_- = (-1 + 2i) / sqrt(14)

The probabilities are |c_+|^2 and |c_-|^2.

Compute |c_+|^2: (3)^2 /14 = 9/14 ≈ 0.642857.

Compute |c_-|^2:
| -1 + 2i |^2 = (-1)^2 + (2)^2 = 1 +4=5. So 5/14 ≈ 0.357143.

Wait, but wait a minute. Wait, 3^2 is 9, 9/14 is approximately 0.6428, which is about 0.64, and 5/14 is about 0.357, which is ~0.36. So the probabilities are 9/14 and 5/14.

Looking at the options, option A says 0.64 and 0.36, which matches these numbers. Option A's probabilities are 0.64 and 0.36.

Wait, but let me check the calculations again to be sure I didn't make a mistake.

Compute the expansion again:

(1+i + 2 -i ) = (1+2) + i -i → 3.

(1+i) - (2 -i) = 1 +i -2 +i → (-1) + 2i. So that's correct.

So |alpha> = [3 |+x> + (-1 + 2i)|−x> ] / sqrt(14).

Now, for the average value of the operator A. The average value is <A> = <alpha| A |alpha>.

Alternatively, since A is diagonal in the |+x> and |−x> basis, the expectation value is |c_+|^2 (ħ/2) + |c_-|^2 (-ħ/2) ).

Wait, no, because the eigenstates |+x> have eigenvalue +ħ/2, and |−x> have eigenvalue -ħ/2.

So <A> = |c_+|^2*(ħ/2) + |c_-|^2*(-ħ/2).

We have |c_+|^2 =9/14, |c_-|^2=5/14.

So <A> = (9/14)(ħ/2) + (5/14)(-ħ/2) = [ (9 -5)/14 ] * (ħ/2) = (4/14)(ħ/2) = (2/7)(ħ/2) = ħ/(7).

Wait, but option A says the average is hbar/7. So that matches.

Wait but looking back, option A says probabilities 0.64 and 0.36, and average hbar/7. So according to this, the answer would be option A.

But wait, wait another moment. Let's compute <A> using another method to verify.

Another approach: since A is a 2x2 matrix, and |alpha> is a normalized state, perhaps we can compute <A> directly.

First, write |alpha> in vector form. The state |up> is (1, 0), |down> is (0,1). So |alpha> in vector form is:

(
