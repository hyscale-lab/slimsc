Okay, I have a chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, so let me try to figure it out. The question is about selecting the correct reagents for two reactions. Let me read the problem again.

The first reaction is butan-2-one reacting with NaCN and reagent A to form 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. The second reaction involves 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile reacting with reagent B (which is H2O) to form 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid.

Hmm, so I need to find out what reagent A and B are. The options are A, B, C, D, each providing A and B as certain compounds.

Starting with the first reaction. Butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO, a ketone. NaCN is sodium cyanide. So, when a ketone reacts with a cyanide, what usually happens? I remember that ketones can undergo various nucleophilic additions. Wait, in the presence of an acid catalyst, maybe?

Wait, the product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Let me write the structures. Butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO. The product is O-hydroxy and a nitrile group attached to the same carbon. So, it's a hydroxy nitrile. How does that form?

I think that when a ketone reacts with a cyanide ion (CN^-), it goes through a process called the Stephen reduction or maybe another type of addition. Wait, no, Stephen is about forming alkenes. Alternatively, maybe it's the formation of a cyanohydrin.

Oh right! The cyanohydrin formation. In this reaction, a ketone (or aldehyde) reacts with a cyanide ion in the presence of an acid catalyst to form a cyanohydrin. The acid helps to protonate the carbonyl oxygen, making the carbonyl carbon more electrophilic. The CN- acts as a nucleophile, attacking the carbonyl carbon. Then, the oxygen gets a proton, and we get an alcohol and a cyanide attached.

So, the cyanide would add to the carbonyl carbon, and the oxygen becomes an -OH group. That fits the product structure. So, for the first reaction, reagent A must be an acid catalyst, like H3O+ (which is option A or B), or maybe something else.

Wait, the options for A are either H3O+ or NaHSO3. NaHSO3 is sodium bisulfate, which is a source of H+ and SO3^2- as a nucleophile. But in this case, I think the acid is needed for the cyanohydrin formation. So, if A is H3O+, that makes sense. So, in the first step, butan-2-one + NaCN (which provides CN^-) and H3O+ (acid) would form the cyanohydrin.

So, for the first reaction, A is H3O+. Let's look at the options. Options A and B have A as H3O+, options C and D have A as NaHSO3. So the correct options are A or B or D.

Now, the second reaction. The starting material is 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile. Wait, that's a bit complex. Let me parse that. It's 2-hydroxy butanenitrile with a 4-benzylphenyl group attached to the 2nd carbon. So, the structure is something like:

Ph-C6H4-CH2-CH2-CH2-Câ‰¡N with a hydroxyl group on the same carbon as the nitrile? Wait, no, the butanenitrile part is four carb
