Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let me see what the question is again.

So, the question is about finding the eigenvector of a quantum mechanical operator P for a muon along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane. The eigenvalue is +ħ/2. Hmm, okay.

Wait, the operator P is a vector operator, right? So it has components P_x, P_y, P_z, each of which is a 2x2 matrix multiplied by ħ/2. The components are given, so I can write them out.

The P_x matrix is [[0,1],[1,0]] multiplied by ħ/2. Similarly, P_y is [[0,-i],[i,0]] multiplied by ħ/2. P_z is [[1,0],[0,-1]] multiplied by ħ/2.

But wait, the operator they're talking about is P, which I think is the vector operator. So the total operator P would be given in terms of components, but maybe the direction is arbitrary. But wait, the direction n is in the x-z plane. So the direction vector n can be described using spherical coordinates, perhaps, with some angle θ. Because if it's in the x-z plane, the azimuthal angle φ would be zero or 180, but probably, since it's arbitrary, the direction is along a general θ in x-z.

Wait, no, the direction n is arbitrary in the x-z plane. So n could be any direction making some angle θ with the z-axis, but in the x-z plane, so phi (the azimuthal angle) would be 0. So n is (sinθ, 0, cosθ), perhaps? Or is it (cosθ, 0, sinθ)? Well, depends on the convention. Wait, usually, in spherical coordinates, θ is the polar angle from the z-axis. So a vector pointing in the x-z plane would have components like (sinθ cosφ, sinθ sinφ, cosθ). But since it's in the x-z plane, φ is 0 or 180, but since it's arbitrary but in x-z, maybe the direction is (cosθ, 0, sinθ)? Wait, no, that would be in x-z plane, but I'm a bit confused. Alternatively, perhaps the direction is (sinθ, 0, cosθ), where θ is measured from the x-axis. Hmm, maybe I should think more about that.

But perhaps I can approach this differently. Since
