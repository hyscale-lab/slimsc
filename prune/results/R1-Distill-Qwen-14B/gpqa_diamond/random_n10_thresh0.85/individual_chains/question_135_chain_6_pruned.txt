Okay, so I have this physics problem about the decay of a boson. Let me try to figure it out step by step. I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, but I'll think it through.

The problem gives me a Lagrangian interaction term between a bosonic field X and some fermions. The Lagrangian is written as L(y) = -λf f(y)(ῡ + X(y))ψ_f(y). Hmm, wait, I think that might not be correct. Oh wait, perhaps it's supposed to be something like L = -λ ψ_f (ῡ + X) ψ_f? Or maybe I misread it. Alternatively, perhaps it's written as L = -λ f f(y) times (ῡ + X(y)) ψ_f(y). Wait, maybe it's more like a Yukawa coupling type term where the boson X couples to the fermion ψ_f with a coupling strength λ. So the term could be something like L = -λ X ψ_f ψ_f, where ψ_f is a fermion field. Because in Yukawa interactions, the coupling is between a scalar (or boson) and two fermions.

Wait, the expression given is a bit unclear. Let me parse it again. It says:

L(y) = -λ f f(y) (ῡ + X(y)) ψ_f(y). Hmm, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the notation here. Maybe the fermion fields are written as ψ_f, and they're interacting with the boson X. So perhaps the interaction term is something like λ X ψ_f ψ_f, which would make sense as a Yukawa interaction. So the X boson would couple to two fermions of the same type.

So the X boson is interacting with fermions, and in the Lagrangian, it couples to pairs of fermions. Therefore, the X boson can decay into pairs of fermions, provided the energy allows it, i.e., the mass of X is greater than twice the fermion mass.

The mass of the boson X is given as 6 GeV. So I need to look at all possible fermion pairs that X can decay into, considering their masses.

Now, what fermions are available? Let's list the possible fermions:

Quarks: up (u), down (d), strange (s), charm (c), bottom (b), top (t).
Leptons: electron (e), muon (mu), tau (tau), and their corresponding neutrinos.

But wait, the problem says "fermions" in general. So for decay products, X can decay into any allowed fermion-antifermion pair.

Each fermion has a mass. So the X boson must have a mass greater than twice the mass of the fermion for the decay to be possible at lowest order (since in lowest order, the decay would be X → f f-bar).

So, let me list the masses (approximate) of the fermions:

Up quark (u): ~2 MeV
Down quark (d): ~5 MeV
Strange quark (s): ~100 MeV
Charm quark (c): ~1.3 GeV
Bottom quark (b): ~4.5 GeV
Top quark (t): ~173 GeV (way too heavy)
Electron (e): ~0.5 MeV
Muon (mu): ~105.7 MeV
Tau (tau): ~1.78 GeV
Neutrinos (ν): negligible masses, but perhaps considered as zero.

So each fermion has a certain mass. To decay into a pair, the X's mass (6 GeV) must be at least twice the mass of the fermion. Let's check each possible fermion pair:

1. u quark: 2 MeV. 2*m_u = 4 MeV. So X can decay into u and u-bar. Because 6 GeV is much larger than 4 MeV. So u u-bar is allowed.

2. d quark: 5 MeV. 2*m_d = 10 MeV. X can decay into d d-bar.

3. s quark: 100 MeV. 2*m_s = 200 MeV. X can decay into s s-bar.

4. c quark: 1.3 GeV. 2*m_c = 2.6 GeV. 6 GeV > 2.6 GeV, so c c-bar allowed.

5. b quark: 4.5 GeV. 2*m_b = 9 GeV. Wait, 6 GeV is less than 9 GeV. So X cannot decay into b b-bar because its mass isn't enough. So b and anti-b are too heavy. So that decay is not allowed.

6. t quark: 173 GeV. 2*m_t is way larger than 6 GeV. So t t-bar decay is impossible. Not allowed.

For leptons:

7. e-: 0.5 MeV. 2*m_e ~1 MeV. So e+ e- decay is allowed.

8. mu-: ~105.7 MeV. 2*m_mu ~211.4 MeV. So mu+ mu- decay is allowed.

9. tau-: ~1.78 GeV. 2*m_tau ~3.56 GeV. 6 GeV > 3.56 GeV, so tau+ tau- decay is allowed.

10. Neutrinos: 2*m_nu is negligible, but perhaps for the sake of the problem, but since the mass is zero, it's allowed. But wait, in the
