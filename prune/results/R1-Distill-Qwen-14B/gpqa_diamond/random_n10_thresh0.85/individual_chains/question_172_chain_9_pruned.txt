Okay, so I have this question about stars and their effective temperatures based on the excitation of iron atoms in their photospheres. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think it through.

The question says that in star_1, iron atoms are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to star_2. Oh wait, I remember that the excitation of atoms in a star's photosphere relates to the thermal energy of the star. When a star is hotter, more atoms are excited to higher energy levels.

Oh right, the Boltzmann distribution! That's the key here. The Boltzmann equation describes the distribution of particles in different energy states in a system in thermal equilibrium. The formula is something like the ratio of populations in two energy levels.

The Boltzmann equation is: (n_upper / n_lower) = (g_upper / g_lower) * exp( -ΔE/(k*T) )

Where:
- n_upper and n_lower are the number of particles in the upper and lower energy levels.
- g_upper and g_lower are the statistical weights (degeneracy) of those levels.
- ΔE is the energy difference between the levels.
- k is the Boltzmann constant.
- T is the temperature.

In this problem, the energy difference (ΔE) is given as 1.38e-23 J. Wait, but the ratio of excitation states is given for the two stars. So for star_1, n1_upper / n1_lower is twice that of star_2's (n2_upper / n2_lower).

Wait, no, the question says iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited as those in star_2. So I think that means the excitation ratio (n_upper / n_lower) for star_1 is twice that of star_2. So (n1_upper/n1_lower) = 2 * (n2_upper/n2_lower).

Assuming that the statistical weights g are the same for both stars, otherwise the problem doesn't give any info about that. So I can assume g1 = g2, so they cancel out.

So the ratio equation becomes:

(n1_upper / n1_lower) / (n2_upper / n2_lower) ) = 2

Which is [ (n1/n1_lower) ] / [ (n2_upper / n2_lower) ] = 2.

Wait, no, more accurately, for each star, their respective ratios are:

For star 1: (n1_upper)/(n1_lower) = (g1/g1_lower) * exp( -ΔE/(k T1) )

Similarly for star 2: (n2_upper)/(n2_lower) = (g2/g2_lower) * exp( -ΔE/(k T2) )

But since the problem states that the energy difference ΔE is the same for both, and assuming the statistical weights are the same (like same ionization state and same transition), then (g1/g1_lower) = (g2/g2_lower). So we can set them equal, and the ratio between the two stars is then:

[(n1_upper/n1
