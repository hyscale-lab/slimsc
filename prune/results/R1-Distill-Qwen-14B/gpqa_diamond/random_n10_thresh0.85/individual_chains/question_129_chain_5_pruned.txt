Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit stuck, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me start by reading the question carefully.

The question is about identifying compound E in a reaction scheme. The reaction steps are:

1. Compound A reacts with HCN to form compound B.
2. Compound B is reduced with H2 and Pd to give compound C.
3. Compound C reacts with HNO2 (nitrous acid) to form compound D.
4. Compound D loses an inert gas to form compound E.

There are also some hints provided. Let me note them down:

Hint a) Compound A, when reacted with an unknown phosphorous ylide, forms 1,2-dimethyl-4-(propan-2-ylidene)cyclopentane.

Hint b) IR spectrum of A shows a strong peak around 1750 cm^-1, and E's IR is around 1715 cm^-1.

The options are A, B, C, D, each being a cycloalkanone with different substituents.

So, my goal is to figure out what each compound is based on the reactions and the hints.

Let me break down the reactions step by step.

First, Compound A reacts with HCN to form B. HCN usually adds to carbonyl groups, so A must have a carbonyl. The IR peak at ~1750 cm^-1 supports this because that's where ketones (around 1700-1750) and possibly esters or other carbonyls absorb.

So, A is likely a ketone. When a ketone reacts with HCN, it forms a cyanohydrin. Cyanohydrins are addition products, so B would be a secondary alcohol with a cyano group adjacent.

Next, B is reduced with H2 and Pd. That's a hydrogenation catalyst, so I think it's a catalytic hydrogenation. But wait, hydrogenation usually reduces double bonds or carbonyls. Since B is a cyanohydrin (which has an -OH and a -CN group attached to a carbon), maybe the reduction is targeting the nitrile group. Oh wait, when nitriles (CN) are hydrogenated, they typically become amines. But wait, catalytic hydrogenation of a nitrile (RCN) with H2 and Pd would give RCH2NH2? No, wait, more accurately, RCN + H2 (with a catalyst like Pd) typically reduces to RCH2NH2 (a primary amine). But wait, another possibility is that if it's a different catalyst, maybe it reduces the nitrile to an amine, but sometimes it's done under different conditions. Alternatively, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Alternatively, perhaps the reduction is of a double bond if B has one. Wait, cyanohydrin formation typically would produce a secondary alcohol and a nitrile on the same carbon. So if A is a ketone, B would have OH and CN on the same carbon, making it a vicinal diol? No, wait, cyanohydrin adds across the carbonyl, so the structure would be R-C(OH)-CN.

Wait, let me think again. The structure of A: suppose A is a cycloalkanone, say cyclopentanone. Then, reacting with HCN would form a cyanohydrin, which would be a cyclopentane ring with a -CH(OH)-CN group attached. So B would be a 4-cyanocyclopentanol or something similar.

Then, when B is reduced with H2 and Pd, what happens? Maybe the nitrile group is hydrogenated. So, RCN becomes RCH2NH2? Or maybe it's hydrogenated to RCH2NH2, but that's an amine, which would change the structure. Alternatively, perhaps the hydrogenation is of another functional group in B. Wait, but B is a secondary alcohol with a nitrile group. Alternatively, perhaps the reduction is of the nitrile to an amine, but that might not fit. Alternatively, perhaps the hydrogenation is reducing the double bond if B has one, but I don't think so because the cyanohydrin doesn't have a double bond.

Wait, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Let's think again: when a ketone reacts with HCN, it forms a cyanohydrin. The structure would have a CH(OH)CN group attached to the cyclo structure. So B would have a secondary alcohol and a nitrile group on adjacent carbons.

Now, when B is reduced with H2 and Pd, perhaps the nitrile group is being reduced. Nitriles can be hydrogen
