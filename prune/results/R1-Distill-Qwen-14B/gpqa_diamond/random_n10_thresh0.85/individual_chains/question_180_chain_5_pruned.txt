Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm trying to figure out how to approach it. Let me read it again.

The problem says we've got an isolated system of 13 identical particles, each with charge 2e. So, each charge is twice the elementary charge, which is about 1.6e-19 coulombs. So each charge here would be 3.2e-19 coulombs, right?

Now, the setup is that 12 of these charges are constrained to stay at 2 meters from a point P. The 13th charge is fixed at P. The question is asking for the minimum energy of this system, correct to three decimals. The options are given as A, B, C, D.

Hmm, so I think this is an electrostatic potential energy problem. Since all the charges are the same and placed in a symmetric way, except for the one at P, I guess we need to calculate the potential energy between them.

Wait, but wait. The system is isolated, so we don't have any external fields to consider. The energy we're calculating is the electrostatic potential energy stored in the system.

I remember that the electrostatic potential energy (U) between two point charges is given by Coulomb's law formula: U = k * (q1 * q2) / r, where k is Coulomb's constant, approximately 8.988e9 N·m²/C².

But wait, in this case, the 13th charge is fixed at P, and the other 12 are at 2m away from P. So each of the 12 charges is at a distance of 2m from the 13th charge. So each of those 12 contributes some potential energy to the system.

Wait, but the system's total potential energy would be the sum of all pairwise interactions. Hmm. Wait, no. Let me think again. Because the 13th charge is fixed, perhaps the only interactions we need to consider are between the 13th and each of the 12 others. Because the 12 others are constrained at 2m from P, but their positions relative to each other are not specified. Oh, wait, the problem says the 12 charges are constrained to stay at 2m from P. So their positions are all the same distance from P. But are they arranged in a way that they are all at the same point, which would be impossible, or perhaps they form a regular dodecahedron or something around P?

Wait, no. The problem doesn't specify the arrangement of the 12 charges around P. It only says they are at 2m from point P. So for the purpose of calculating potential energy, perhaps we can treat each of the 12
