Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics question about density matrices. Hmm, I remember that density matrices are used to describe the state of a quantum system, especially when it's mixed or entangled. The question gives a specific density matrix and asks about its geometrical position in qubit space. The options are points in 3D space, which is a bit confusing because qubits are two-level systems, so I'm not sure how that translates to 3D coordinates. Let me think.

The density matrix given is ρ = (1/2)(|0><0| + |1><1|). Wait, I recall that for a single qubit, the density matrix can be represented in the Bloch sphere. The Bloch sphere is a geometric representation where each point corresponds to a possible state of the qubit. The general form for a single qubit density matrix is (I + r·σ)/2, where σ are the Pauli matrices and r is a vector (x, y, z) with magnitude ≤ 1.

So let me write out the given ρ. It's (|0><0| + |1><1|) multiplied by 1/2. Oh wait, |0> is [1, 0]^T and |1> is [0,1]^T. So |0><0| would be a matrix with 1 in the (1,1) position and zeros elsewhere. Similarly, |1><1| has 1 in (2,2). Adding them together gives a 2x2 identity matrix. So ρ = (I)/2, since I is the identity matrix, which is 2x2 with all diagonal elements 1.

Wait, the general form is (I + r·σ)/2. So if I set (I + r·σ)/2 equal to ρ, then ρ is (I)/2 only when r·σ is zero. Because (I)/2 = (I + 0)/2. So r·σ must be zero matrix. That implies that r is the zero vector, right? Because if r is (x, y, z), then r·σ is xσx + yσy + zσz. For that to be zero, each component must be zero, so x=0, y=0, z=0.

So the vector r is (0,0,0), which corresponds to the completely mixed state. In the Bloch sphere, the origin is the maximally mixed state, whereas the surface represents pure states. So the density matrix given is the maximally mixed state, which has no coherence and equal probabilities for |0> and |1>. That makes sense because ρ has diagonal entries 1/2 each and off-diagonal zero.

Looking at the options, option C is (0,0,0), so the correct answer should be C.


The given density matrix is:

\[
\rho = \frac{1}{2} \left( \left|0\right\rangle \left\langle 0\right| + \left|1\right\rangle \left\langle 1\right| \right).
\]

For a single qubit, the density matrix can be represented in the Bloch sphere formalism as:

\[
\rho = \frac{1}{2} \left( I + \mathbf{r} \cdot \boldsymbol{\sigma} \right),
\]

where \( I \) is the identity matrix, \( \boldsymbol{\sigma} \) are the Pauli matrices, and \( \mathbf{r} = (x, y, z) \) is a vector with magnitude \( \|\mathbf{r}\| \leq 1 \). Comparing this general form to the given \( \rho \), we see that \( \rho = \frac{1}{2} I \), which implies \( \mathbf{r} \cdot \boldsymbol{\sigma} = 0 \). This means \( \mathbf{r} \) must be the zero vector, i.e., \( \mathbf{r} = (0, 0, 0) \).

In the Bloch sphere representation, the origin corresponds to the maximally mixed state, which is consistent with the given density matrix. The density matrix \( \rho \) represents a state with equal probabilities for \( |0\rangle \) and \( |1\rangle \), with no coherence, confirming that it corresponds to the point \( (0, 0, 0) \) in qubit space.

Thus, the correct answer is:

**Answer: C**
