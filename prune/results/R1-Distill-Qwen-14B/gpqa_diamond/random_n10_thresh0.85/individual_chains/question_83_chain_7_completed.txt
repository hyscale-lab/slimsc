Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here. Let me see if I can figure it out. The question is about titrating acetic acid with NaOH and finding the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point. Hmm, I remember that acetic acid is a weak acid, and NaOH is a strong base, so it should form a salt when they react.

Alright, let's start by understanding the problem. We have 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid. Then, we dilute it with 20.00 cm³ of water. So the total volume becomes 40 cm³. After that, we titrate this diluted solution with 0.1 M NaOH. We need to find the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point.

Wait, what's 25% titration mean? Oh right, it means that 25% of the acetic acid has been neutralized by the NaOH. So for each mole of acetic acid, a quarter has reacted with NaOH, and three quarters remain, plus the conjugate base formed.

First, let's find the moles of acetic acid initially. The volume is 20 cm³ (which is 0.020 L) and concentration is 0.05 M. So moles = 0.05 * 0.02 = 0.001 moles. Then, when we dilute with 20 cm³ water, the total volume is 40 cm³ (0.040 L). So the new concentration is moles/volume = 0.001 / 0.04 = 0.025 M. Wait, but wait, when you dilute a solution, the concentration decreases. So yes, 0.001 mol in 0.04 L is 0.025 M acetic acid.

Now, during titration with NaOH, each mole of NaOH reacts with a mole of acetic acid. The NaOH concentration is 0.1 M.

At 25% titration: 25% of the acetic acid has been neutralized. So the moles reacted are 0.25 * 0.001 = 0.00025 mol. So the moles remaining of acetic acid are 0.001 - 0.00025 = 0.00075 mol. And the moles of acetate ion (CH3COO-) formed are 0.00025 mol.

But wait, after adding NaOH, the total volume increases. Let me think: The initial solution is 40 cm³. How much NaOH is added? Hmm, let's see. Since 25% of the acetic acid is titrated, the moles of NaOH added are 0.00025 mol. The NaOH solution is 0.1 M, so volume is moles / concentration = 0.00025 / 0.1 = 0.0025 L = 2.5 cm³. So total volume is 40 + 2.5 = 42.5 cm³. 

But for buffer solution calculations, maybe the dilution can be considered, but perhaps it's easier to use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation because it's a buffer.

So, the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation is pH = pKa + log([A-]/[HA]). The pKa is given by the negative log of Ka. Ka is 1.85e-5. So pKa is about log(1/(1.85e-5)) = around 4.73, because 1e-5 has pKa 5, and 1.85 is a bit more, so pKa is 4.73. I think that's correct.

So, for 25% titration, the ratio of [A-]/[HA] is (0.00025)/(0.00075) = 1/3. So log(1/3) is about -0.477. pH would be 4.73 - 0.477 ≈ 4.25. Hmm, but wait, let me calculate it more accurately.

Calculating pKa: Ka =1.85e-5. pKa = -log(1.85e-5). Let's compute that. Log(1.85) is about 0.267, so pKa is 4.733 (since 5 - 0.267 is 4.733). So using that.

The ratio is (0.00025) / (0.00075) = 1/3. So log(1/3) is ~-0.477. So pH = 4.733 - 0.477 = 4.256, approximately 4.26. So for the first part (25% titration), the pH is around 4.26.

Now, what about the equivalence point? At equivalence, all the acetic acid has been neutralized to acetate. So the solution is a solution of sodium acetate in water. Since NaOH is a strong base, it will dissociate completely, and the acetate ions will hydrolyze in water to form a basic solution.

First, let's find the moles. At equivalence, all 0.001 mol of acetic acid have reacted. The NaOH added would be 0.001 mol, so the volume of NaOH needed is 0.001 / 0.1 = 0.01 L =10 cm³. So total volume is 40 +10 =50 cm³.

Sodium acetate dissociates completely into Na+ and CH3COO-. The acetate ion is the conjugate base of acetic acid, so it will hydrolyze in water:

CH3COO- + H2O ↔ CH3COOH + OH-

The Kb for this reaction can be calculated from Kw / Ka. Kw is 1e-14, so Kb = (1e-14)/(1.85e-5) ≈ 5.405e-10. Hmm, that's a small Kb, so the solution will be slightly basic.

The concentration of acetate ions is moles/volume. Moles are 0.001, volume is 0.05 L. So concentration is 0.001 / 0.05 =0.02 M.

Using the Kb expression:
Kb = [CH3COOH][OH-]/[CH3COO-]

Assuming x is the [OH-], then Kb ≈ x² / (0.02 - x). But since Kb is so small, x will be much smaller than 0.02, so we can approximate 0.02 -x ≈0.02.

So x² ≈ Kb * 0.02 → x² ≈ (5.405e-10) *0.02=1.081e-11 → x= sqrt(1.081e-11) ≈ 3.29e-6.

So [OH-] is about 3.29e-6 M. Then pOH= -log(3.29e-6) ≈5.48. So pH=14 -5.48=8.52.

Wait, but wait, that's a high pH. Because acetate is a weak base, but perhaps I made a mistake in calculation.

Wait, let me recheck the Kb. Ka for acetic acid is 1.85e-5, so Kb is 1e-14 /1.85e-5 ≈5.405e-10. Correct.

Molarity of acetate is 0.001 mol / 0.05 L= 0.02 M. Correct.

So Kb =5.405e-10 = x²/(0.02). So x²= 1.081e-11 → x= 3.288e-6. Correct.

pOH is -log(3.288e-6). Let's compute log(3.288e-6):

Log(3.288) is about 0.516, so log(3.288e-6)=0.516 -6= -5.484. So pOH is 5.484. pH is 14-5.484=8.516, which is approximately 8.52.

So at equivalence point, pH is around 8.52.

Looking at the options:

Option A is 4.26;8.52.

Option D is 4.57;6.92.

Wait, but let me check the Henderson-Hasselbalch calculation again. I think I might have made a mistake in the mole calculations.

Wait, when we diluted 20 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid with 20 cm³ water, the new concentration is 0.025 M. Then, when 25% is titrated, the moles of acetic acid and acetate are 0.00075 and 0.00025, respectively. But wait, no, because when you dilute 20 cm³ into 40 cm³, the moles are same as before. Wait, no, the initial moles were 0.05 *0.02=0.001 mol. Diluting to 40 cm³ doesn't change the moles, just the concentration.

So when 25% is titrated, moles reacted: 0.00025 mol. So HA = 0.00075 mol, A- = 0.00025.

But what is the total volume after adding NaOH up to 25%?

Wait, the initial solution is 40 cm³. The NaOH added is 2.5 cm³. So total volume is 42.5 cm³=0.0425 L.

So the concentrations are:

[HA] = 0.00075 / 0.0425 ≈ 0.017647 M

[A-] = 0.00025 / 0.0425 ≈0.005882 M

So the ratio [A-]/[HA] = (0.00025/0.0425) / (0.00075/0.0425 )= (0.00025)/(0.00075) = 1/3. So same as before, so the pH is 4.26. So that part is correct.

So, looking at the options, option A is 4.26 and 8.52, which matches.

Wait, but looking at option D: 4.57 and 6.92. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake somewhere.

Wait, another thought. Did I correctly calculate the moles at 25% titration?

Wait, the initial solution is 40 cm³ of 0.025 M acetic acid, which is 0.001 mol. When titrated with 25% of this, the NaOH added is 0.001 * 0.25 =0.00025 mol. So yes, correct.

Wait another thing: Is the solution after 25% titration still a buffer? Yes, because some HA and some A- are present. So using Henderson-Hasselbalch is correct.

So the first pH is 4.26, and the equivalence pH is 8.52. So the correct option should be A.

But let me think again about the equivalence point. The solution is acetate ion in water, so it's a basic solution. But wait, when we have sodium acetate, the Na+ is a spectator ion, so the solution's pH is determined by the acetate.

Wait, another approach: moles of acetate is 0.001, and the volume is 50 cm³. So the concentration is 0.02 M. Kb =5.405e-10.

The hydrolysis equation: CH3COO^- + H2O ↔ CH3COOH + OH^-.

The Kb expression is ( [CH3COOH][OH^-] ) / [CH3COO^-] =5.405e-10.

Initial concentration: [CH3COO^-] =0.02 M, others are zero.

Change: let x be [OH^-] produced. Then:

At equilibrium,

[CH3COO^-] ≈ 0.02 - x ≈0.02 (since x is small).

[CH3COOH] =x

[OH^-] =x

So Kb = (x^2)/0.02 =5.405e-10 → x² = 5.405e-10 *0.02 =1.081e-11 → x= sqrt(1.081e-11)= ~3.29e-6 M.

pOH= -log(3.29e-6)=5.48 → pH=8.52. That's correct.

So option A is correct. So the answer should be option A: 4.26;8.52.


To solve the problem, we analyze the titration of acetic acid (CH₃COOH) with sodium hydroxide (NaOH) at 25% titration and at the equivalence point. The key steps are as follows:

### Initial Setup
1. **Initial moles of acetic acid**:  
   The volume of acetic acid is 20.00 cm³ (0.020 L), and its concentration is 0.05 M.  
   \[
   \text{Moles of CH₃COOH} = 0.05 \times 0.020 = 0.001 \, \text{mol}.
   \]

2. **Dilution with water**:  
   After diluting with 20.00 cm³ of water, the total volume becomes 40.00 cm³ (0.040 L). The new concentration of acetic acid is:  
   \[
   \text{Concentration of CH₃COOH} = \frac{0.001}{0.040} = 0.025 \, \text{M}.
   \]

### 25% Titration
At 25% titration, 25% of the acetic acid has reacted with NaOH.  
- **Moles reacted**:  
  \[
  \text{Moles reacted} = 0.25 \times 0.001 = 0.00025 \, \text{mol}.
  \]
- **Remaining moles of CH₃COOH**:  
  \[
  \text{Remaining moles} = 0.001 - 0.00025 = 0.00075 \, \text{mol}.
  \]
- **Moles of CH₃COO⁻ formed**:  
  \[
  \text{Moles of CH₃COO⁻} = 0.00025 \, \text{mol}.
  \]

The total volume after adding 2.5 cm³ of NaOH (calculated from the moles of NaOH reacted) is:  
\[
\text{Total volume} = 40.00 \, \text{cm³} + 2.5 \, \text{cm³} = 42.50 \, \text{cm³} = 0.0425 \, \text{L}.
\]

- **Concentrations**:  
  \[
  [\text{CH₃COOH}] = \frac{0.00075}{0.0425} \approx 0.01765 \, \text{M}, \quad [\text{CH₃COO⁻}] = \frac{0.00025}{0.0425} \approx 0.00588 \, \text{M}.
  \]

Using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation:  
\[
\text{pH} = \text{pKa} + \log \left( \frac{[\text{CH₃COO⁻}]}{[\text{CH₃COOH}]} \right),
\]
where \(\text{pKa} = -\log(1.85 \times 10^{-5}) \approx 4.73\).  
\[
\text{pH} = 4.73 + \log \left( \frac{0.00588}{0.01765} \right) = 4.73 + \log(0.333) \approx 4.73 - 0.477 = 4.26.
\]

### Equivalence Point
At the equivalence point, all the acetic acid has been neutralized to form acetate ions (CH₃COO⁻).  
- **Moles of CH₃COO⁻**:  
  \[
  \text{Moles of CH₃COO⁻} = 0.001 \, \text{mol}.
  \]
- **Total volume**:  
  The volume of NaOH added is \( \frac{0.001}{0.1} = 0.010 \, \text{L} = 10.00 \, \text{cm³}\).  
  \[
  \text{Total volume} = 40.00 \, \text{cm³} + 10.00 \, \text{cm³} = 50.00 \, \text{cm³} = 0.050 \, \text{L}.
  \]
- **Concentration of CH₃COO⁻**:  
  \[
  [\text{CH₃COO⁻}] = \frac{0.001}{0.050} = 0.020 \, \text{M}.
  \]

The acetate ion hydrolyzes in water:  
\[
\text{CH₃COO⁻} + \text{H₂O} \leftrightarrow \text{CH₃COOH} + \text{OH⁻}.
\]
The equilibrium constant for this reaction is \( \text{K}_b = \frac{\text{K}_w}{\text{K}_a} = \frac{1.0 \times 10^{-14}}{1.85 \times 10^{-5}} \approx 5.41 \times 10^{-10} \).

Using the expression for \( \text{K}_b \):  
\[
\text{K}_b = \frac{[\text{CH₃COOH}][\text{OH⁻}]}{[\text{CH₃COO⁻}]}.
\]
Assuming \( [\text{OH⁻}] = x \), we approximate \( [\text{CH₃COO⁻}] \approx 0.020 \, \text{M} \).  
\[
x^2 = \text{K}_b \cdot [\text{CH₃COO⁻}] = (5.41 \times 10^{-10})(0.020) = 1.08 \times 10^{-11}.
\]
\[
x = \sqrt{1.08 \times 10^{-11}} \approx 3.29 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{M}.
\]
\[
[\text{OH⁻}] = 3.29 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{M}.
\]
\[
\text{pOH} = -\log(3.29 \times 10^{-6}) \approx 5.48, \quad \text{pH} = 14 - 5.48 = 8.52.
\]

### Final Answer
At 25% titration, the pH is approximately **4.26**, and at the equivalence point, the pH is approximately **8.52**.
