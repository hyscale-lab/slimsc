Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem in front of me, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me start by reading the question carefully.

The problem is about cobalt(II) ions in a solution with thiocyanate. The total cobalt concentration is 1e-2 M, and the thiocyanate concentration is 0.1 M. The stability constants for the cobalt thiocyanato complexes are given as β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, and β4=16. The question is asking for the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes among all cobalt-containing species.

Hmm, I remember that stability constants (β) are related to the formation of complexes. Each β corresponds to the formation of a complex with a certain number of thiocyanate ligands. So, β1 is for the first complex, maybe [Co(SCN)]^+, β2 for [Co(SCN)₂]^2+, and so on.

Wait, the problem mentions the blue dithiocyanato complex. I think the blue one is the [Co(SCN)₂]^2+ complex, which is the second one, right? So that's the [Co(SCN)_2]^(2+) complex, which would correspond to β2=40. But wait, the options for β are β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, and β4=16. Oh, wait, so maybe β3 is for [Co(SCN)_3]^- or something else. Hmm, not sure yet.

The question is about finding the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato complex, which I think is the [Co(SCN)_2]^(2+) ion. So that's the species with two SCN- ligands. But wait, wait—the problem says "dithiocyanato," which implies two SCN- groups. So yes, that's the second complex, but wait, the β values go up to β4. So perhaps the complexes are:

β1: [CoSCN]^+
β2: [Co(SCN)_2]^{2+}
β3: [Co(SCN)_3]^{3+}
β4: [Co(SCN)_4]^4−

Wait, but that doesn't align with the numbers given. Or maybe I'm getting the charge wrong. Alternatively, the stability constants might not be in order of increasing number of ligands. Wait, β3 is 63, which is higher than β2's 40. That suggests that the third complex is more stable than the second. So maybe the complexes are:

n=1: [Co(SCN)]^+
n=2: [Co(SCN)_2]^2+
n=3: [Co(SCN)_3]^0 (neutral)
n=4: [Co(SCN)_4]^2−?

But I'm not entirely sure about the charges. Maybe the way the complexes form is that each SCN- is a -1 charge. So Co^2+ with n SCN- would have a charge of 2+ -n SCN- * (-1) each. Wait, no: each SCN- is -1, so n SCN- would contribute n*(-1) = -n. So the complex would have a charge of 2+ + (-n) = (2-n)+.

Wait, so for n=1: charge is (2-1)=+1 → [Co(SCN)]^+
n=2: (2-2)=0 → [Co(SCN)_2]
n=3: (2-3)=-1 → [Co(SCN)_3]^-
n=4: (2-4)=-2 → [Co(SCN)_4]^2-

But I'm not certain about the exact charges here. Regardless, the main point is that each β corresponds to the formation of a complex with n SCN- ligands. 

The problem is asking for the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato complex, which I think is the [Co(SCN)_2]^{2+} or another form. But perhaps the blue complex is [Co(SCN)_2]^2+, which has β2=40.

Wait, but let me think again. The question is about the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato complexes. I've heard that [Co(SCN)_2]^2+ is blue, while [Co(SCN)_3]^− is a different color, maybe brown or another color. So the blue one is the dithiocyanato complex, which is the n=2 complex, corresponding to β2=40.

So, our goal is to find the fraction of all cobalt species that are in the form [Co(SCN)_2]^{2+}.

But wait, the problem statement says "the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes." Dithiocyanato implies two SCN- ligands. So yes, [Co(SCN)_2]^{2+} is the species in question.

But how do I calculate the percentage? I think I'll need to use the stability constants to find the concentrations of all the possible complexes and then sum them up, then find the fraction that is the blue one.

Let me outline what I know:

The total cobalt concentration is c_total = 1e-2 M. That's the sum of all cobalt species: Co^2+ and all the complexes [Co(SCN)_n]^{charge} for n=1,2,3,4.

The thiocyanate concentration is [SCN^-] = 0.1 M.

The stability constants are:

β1 = 9 → for [CoSCN]^+
β2 = 40 → for [Co(SCN)_2]^{2+}
β3 = 63 → for [Co(SCN)_
