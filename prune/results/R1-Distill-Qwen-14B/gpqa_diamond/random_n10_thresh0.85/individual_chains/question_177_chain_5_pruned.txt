Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I need to figure it out. Hmm, let's read it again. 

So, we have two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than Star_2, and the same goes for their masses. They found that the wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest are the same. The radial velocities are 0 for Star_1 and 700 km/s for Star_2. We're told to assume they radiate as black bodies, and we need to find the factor by which Star_1's luminosity is greater than Star_2's.

Wait, right. I remember that the peak wavelength of a black body's emission is given by Wien's Law. Oh, right, Wien's displacement law: λ_max = b / T, where b is Wien's constant and T is the temperature. So, since the peak wavelengths are the same for both stars, their temperatures must be the same. So T1 = T2.

But wait, does radial velocity affect this? Oh, right, because if a star is moving towards or away from us, there's a Doppler shift. Radial velocity affects the observed wavelength. Oh! So if Star_2 has a radial velocity of 700 km/s, that would shift its emission. But wait, the problem says that the wavelengths at which they appear brightest are the same. So perhaps the observed wavelengths are the same, but the intrinsic (rest) wavelengths might differ because of the Doppler effect.

Wait, how does that work? Let me think. The Doppler effect formula for wavelength shift is λ_observed = λ_rest * sqrt( (1 + v_r) / (1 - v_r) ), assuming v is much less than the speed of light, which it is here (700 km/s is about 0.23% the speed of light, so non-relativistic approximation might be okay). Alternatively, sometimes they use the approximation λ_obs ≈ λ_rest (1 + v_r / c), but I'm not sure if that's applicable here.

Wait, but in our case, the peak wavelengths are observed to be the same. So λ1_obs = λ2_obs. But λ1_obs is due to Star_1's actual temperature, and λ2_obs is due to Star_2's temperature, but Doppler shifted because Star_2 is moving.

Wait, no. Let me think again. So, the peak emission for each star is
