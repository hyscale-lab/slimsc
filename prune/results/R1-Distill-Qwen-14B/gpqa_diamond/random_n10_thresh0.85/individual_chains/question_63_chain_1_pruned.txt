Okay, so I've got this physics problem about diatomic molecules and the quantum rotation-vibration model. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but let me think through it step by step.

The question says that the molecule is in its fundamental state and absorbs a photon. We need to find the momentum of the photon so that the molecule switches to the next lowest energy state. 

First, I remember that in the non-rigid rotor model, the energy levels are a combination of rotational and vibrational states. But wait, the question specifies the rotation-vibration model, which I think is sometimes called the rigid rotor and harmonic oscillator model. Oh wait, no, the non-rigid rotor is a different model, maybe where the bond length isn't fixed. But maybe for this problem, the specifics of the model don't matter as much as the energy transitions.

The molecule is in its fundamental state. The fundamental state in such models is the lowest energy state, which I think is the ground state. For both rotational and vibrational energy levels, the fundamental state is the lowest. So, what's the next state with the lowest possible energy? I'm a bit confused. Oh wait, the question says "switch to the next state with the lowest possible energy." So, next in terms of energy, not just a higher rotational state. So, perhaps the next higher energy state overall.

But wait, the quantum model for diatomic molecules combines both rotation and vibration. The energy levels have both contributions. So, the molecule could absorb a photon and transition either to a higher vibrational state or a higher rotational state. But the question is about the next lowest energy state. So, the lowest energy transition would involve the smallest possible energy difference. So, I need to find the energy difference between the ground state and the next possible state, whether it's an increase in rotation, vibration, or both.

Wait, but in the rigid rotor and harmonic oscillator models, the vibrational energy levels are quantized as E_vib = (v + 1/2) hν, where ν is the frequency. And the rotational energy levels are E_rot = B J (J+1), where B is the rotational constant, and J is the rotational quantum number. The total energy E is the sum of these two.

In the ground state, the vibrational quantum number v is 0, and the rotational J is also the lowest, which is J=0 (but wait, wait. In rigid rotor, J can start at 0? Or is J=1 the lowest for rotation? Wait, no, J=0 is allowed. But wait, in reality, for linear molecules, J can be 0, 1, 2, etc. But the rotational energy for J=0 is zero. So the ground state would have v=0 and J=0. 

So the next possible state could be either v=1 (next vibrational state) or J=1 (next rotational state). But which transition gives the lower energy difference? Because the photon needs to supply that energy difference. But wait, the question is about the next state with the lowest possible energy, which would be the one with the smallest energy increase. So I need to compute the energy differences for both possible transitions and pick the smaller one.

Alternatively,
