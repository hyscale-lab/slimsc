Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here about the Michael addition reaction. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's try to work through it.

The question has three parts, A, B, and C, each involving different reactants and conditions. I need to find the major products for each and match them with the options given.

First, let's tackle part A: dimethyl malonate + methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate, with NaOEt (sodium ethoxide) in EtOH (ethanol). I remember that the Michael addition involves a nucleophilic attack on an alpha, beta-unsaturated carbonyl compound by an enolate.

So, dimethyl malonate is a good enolate precursor. When treated with a base like NaOEt, it should form an enolate ion. The enolate will attack the beta position of the alpha,beta-unsaturated carbonyl, which here is the methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate.

Wait, wait. Let me think. The structure of methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate would be CH2=CH-CO-OCH3, but wait, no. Wait, acrylate is CH2=CHCOOR. But it's 3-(p-tolyl)acrylate, so the substituent is on the third carbon? Or maybe I'm getting that wrong. Let me try to draw it. Acrylate is CH2=CHCOOR. So 3-position is the middle CH2. Wait, maybe it's CH2=CH-C(p-tolyl)-COOR? No, I'm getting confused.

Wait, the correct structure: The acrylate is CH2=CHCOOCH3. But 3-(p-tolyl) would have the p-tolyl group on the third carbon. So that would be the middle CH2?

Wait, acrylate is CH2=CHCOOCH3. So numbering from the COO- group, the carbons are 1 (COO), 2 (CH2), 3 (CH). So the substituent is on the 3-position. So the structure is CH2=CH-C(p-tolyl)-COOCH3? No, wait, wait. Wait, no, because that would give the structure as CH2=CH-C(p-tolyl)-COOCH3. But that doesn't make sense because the double bond is between carbons 1 and 2. Oh wait, wait, maybe the structure is: (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate is CH2=CH-CO-OCH3 with a p-tolyl group on carbon 3. Wait, maybe I got that wrong. Alternatively, maybe the structure is CH2
