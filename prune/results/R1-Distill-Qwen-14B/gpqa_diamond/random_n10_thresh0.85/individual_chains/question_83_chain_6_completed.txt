Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of titration calculations. Let me take it step by step.

The problem says that we're diluting 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid with 20.00 cm³ of water. Then we titrate that solution with 0.1 M NaOH. We need to find the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point. The options are A to D, each with two pH values.

First, I should figure out what happens when we dilute the acetic acid. Acetic acid is a weak acid, so when we dilute it, the concentration decreases, which would make it weaker, but since it's a weak acid, the degree of ionization might increase. Or wait, no—dilution usually causes more dissociation because there's less concentration of the acid. So the pH should go up a bit compared to the original solution before dilution.

But wait, the first step is to find the new concentration after dilution. The initial volume is 20 cm³, and we add 20 cm³ of water, so the total volume is 40 cm³. The concentration after dilution would be (volume1 * initial concentration) / total volume. Let me compute that.

Initial moles of acetic acid (CH3COOH) = Molarity * Volume (L) = 0.05 M * 0.02 L = 0.001 moles.

After dilution, the volume is 40 cm³, which is 0.04 L. So new concentration = 0.001 moles / 0.04 L = 0.025 M. So the diluted solution is 0.025 M acetic acid.

Wait, but I might have made a mistake here. Let me double-check. 20 cm³ is 0.02 L. 0.05 M * 0.02 L is 0.001 moles. Total volume is 20+20=40 cm³ → 0.04 L. Moles / Volume = 0.001 / 0.04 = 0.025 M. Yeah, that's correct.

Next, when titrating with NaOH. The reaction is CH3COOH + NaOH → CH3COO^- Na+ + H2O.

The equivalence point is when moles of NaOH equal moles of acetic acid. Let's find out how much NaOH is needed for equivalence.

Moles of acetic acid is 0.001 moles (from the initial 20 cm³, since we diluted it but the moles didn't change). So moles of NaOH needed = 0.001 moles.

Volume of NaOH needed at equivalence is moles / concentration. So 0.001 / 0.1 M = 0.01 L = 10 cm³.

But the question is about 25% titration. 25% of the equivalence volume would be 2.5 cm³ of NaOH added. Let me confirm: 10 cm³ is the equivalence point, so 25% is 2.5 cm³.

At 25% titration, which is 2.5 cm³ of NaOH, how much of the acetic acid has reacted?

Moles of NaOH added: 0.1 M * 0.0025 L = 0.00025 moles. Since the reaction is 1:1, that's 0.00025 moles of CH3COOH neutralized, producing CH3COO^-.

So moles of CH3COOH remaining: initial moles 0.001 - 0.00025 = 0.00075 mol.

Moles of CH3COO^- formed: 0.00025 mol.

The solution volume at 25% titration is the initial diluted solution (40 cm³) plus the added NaOH (2.5 cm³). So total volume =42.5 cm³ = 0.0425 L.

Now, I can set up the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation here. Because it's a buffer solution—mix of weak acid and its conjugate base.

Henderson-Hasselbalch equation: pH = pKa + log([A^-]/[HA])

pKa = -log(1.85e-5) ≈ 4.73 (since 1e-5 is 5, 1.85 is a little less than 2, so pKa around 4.73).

So [A^-] is 0.00025 / 0.0425 L = 0.005882 M (approx 0.005882 M)

[HA] is 0.00075 / 0.0425 ≈ 0.017647 M.

So the ratio [A^-]/[HA] = (0.005882)/(0.017647) ≈ 0.33333 → log(1/3) is approximately -0.477.

So pH = 4.73 + (-0.477) ≈ 4.253. Hmm, looking at the options, option A has 4.26; option D has 4.57. Wait, wait, perhaps I made a miscalculation.

Wait, let me compute more accurately.

pKa is 4.73.

[A^-]/[HA] = (0.00025 / 0.0425) / (0.00075 / 0.0425) ) → the volumes cancel out, so it's 0.00025 / 0.00075 = 1/3.

So the ratio is 1/3, log(1/3) is log(0.3333) ≈ -0.477.

So pH = 4.73 - 0.477 = 4.253 ≈ 4.25.

Looking at the options, option A is 4.26; option D is 4.57. So at 25% titration, pH is about 4.25, close to option A's first number.

Wait, but another approach: perhaps when calculating concentrations, I should consider that the solution is a buffer, but the dilution when adding NaOH might affect the molarity.

Wait, wait, no, because when we add 2.5 cm³ to the 40 cm³, the volumes add up, but the concentrations are per the total volume.

Wait another thing: perhaps I should compute exact [A^-] and [HA].

Moles of CH3COOH: 0.00075 mol.

Moles of CH3COO^-: 0.00025 mol.

Total volume: 40 + 2.5 = 42.5 cm³ = 0.0425 L.

So [HA] = 0.00075 / 0.0425 = approx 0.017647 M.

[A^-] = 0.00025 / 0.0425 ≈ 0.005882 M.

So their ratio is 0.005882 / 0.017647 ≈ 0.33333. So the calculation holds.

So pH is 4.73 + log(0.3333) → 4.73 -0.477 → 4.253.

So the pH at 25% is approximately 4.25, which is close to option A's first value (4.26). So for the first part, it's option A or D? Let me check the options.

Looking at the options:

Option A: 4.26; 8.52

Option D:4.57;6.92

Wait, but I also need to calculate the pH at equivalence point. Let's do that.

At equivalence point, all of the acetic acid has been neutralized to its conjugate base, acetate ion (CH3COO^-). Since acetate is the conjugate base of a weak acid, it will hydrolyze in water to produce OH- ions, making the solution basic.

So the concentration of acetate ions at equivalence point is the moles of acetate divided by the total solution volume.

Moles of CH3COO^- is 0.001 moles (same as initial acetic acid moles).

Total volume is initial diluted solution (40 cm³) plus the volume of NaOH added at equivalence (10 cm³), so 50 cm³ → 0.05 L.

Concentration of CH3COO^- = 0.001 / 0.05 = 0.02 M.

Now, the acetate ion will react with water:

CH3COO^- + H2O ↔ CH3COOH + OH^-

The Kb for this reaction can be calculated using Kw / Ka.

Ka is 1.85e-5, so Kb = (1e-14) / (1.85e-5) ≈ 5.405e-10.

So Kb = 5.405e-10.

We can set up the expression for Kb:

Kb = [CH3COOH][OH^-] / [CH3COO^-]

Assuming x is the concentration of OH^- produced, then:

x²/(0.02 - x) ≈ Kb.

Since Kb is very small, x will be much smaller than 0.02, so 0.02 - x ≈ 0.02.

So x² = Kb * 0.02 → x² ≈ 5.405e-10 * 0.02 = 1.081e-11.

x = sqrt(1.081e-11) ≈ 3.29e-6 M.

So [OH^-] ≈ 3.29e-6 M.

pOH = -log(3.29e-6) ≈ 5.487.

pH = 14 -5.487 ≈ 8.513.

So pH at equivalence is approximately 8.51, which is very close to option A's second value (8.52).

Wait, but wait—did I account for all the dilutions correctly?

Let me go through the equivalence point again.

At equivalence, all acetic acid is neutralized, so moles of acetate are 0.001, and the total volume is 40 cm³ + 10 cm³ =50 cm³. So 0.001 / 0.05 L =0.02 M. Correct.

So pH is around 8.51, which is close to 8.52 as in option A.

So the two pH values are approximately 4.25 and 8.51. The closest option is option A: 4.26; 8.52.

Wait, but wait. Let me check the other options. Option D is 4.57 and 6.92. That's way off for the equivalence point. Option B is 3.17 and 6.73. No, because equivalence is around 8.5, so only option A and D have the equivalence point around 8.5 or 6.92.

Wait, wait, am I sure about the equivalence point's pH? Let me think again. At equivalence, the solution is a solution of sodium acetate, which is the conjugate base of acetic acid. So yes, it should hydrolyze to produce OH- ions, making the solution basic. So the pH should be around 8.5, which matches option A.

So the first part is pH about 4.25 and the second is 8.51. So option A is the one with 4.26 and 8.52.

But wait, looking at the options, option D is 4.57;6.92. Hmm, but at equivalence, the pH was around 8.5, which only option A has. So the correct answer must be option A.

Wait, but let me think again about the 25% titration. Another approach: using the buffer equation, but perhaps I should do the exact calculation without approximations.

Wait, let me compute each step with more precise numbers.

First, the initial diluted solution is 0.025 M acetic acid.

At 25% titration, 25% of the equivalence point is reached. So 25% of 10 cm³ is 2.5 cm³ of NaOH added.

Moles of NaOH added: 0.1 M * 0.0025 L = 0.00025 mol.

Moles of acetic acid neutralized: 0.00025 mol. So remaining acetic acid: 0.001 - 0.00025 = 0.00075 mol.

Moles of acetate (CH3COO^-) formed: 0.00025 mol.

Total volume: 40 cm³ + 2.5 cm³ = 42.5 cm³ = 0.0425 L.

Concentration of acetic acid: 0.00075 / 0.0425 = 0.017647 M.

Concentration of acetate: 0.00025 / 0.0425 = 0.005882 M.

Henderson equation: pH = pKa + log([A^-]/[HA])

pKa = log(1/(1.85e-5)) → let me compute pKa more accurately.

Ka =1.85e-5 → pKa = log(1/(1.85e-5)) = log(5.4054e4) → Wait, no, pKa is -log(1.85e-5).

So calculating:

log(1.85e-5) = log(1.85) + log(1e-5) = 0.2672 -5 = -4.7328 → so pKa =4.7328.

So the ratio [A^-]/[HA] = (0.005882)/(0.017647) = 0.3333.

log(0.3333)= approximately -0.4771.

So pH =4.7328 -0.4771 =4.2557, which is approximately 4.26. So yes, that's correct.

So at 25% titration, pH is 4.26, and at equivalence point, pH is about 8.51, which is 8.52 when rounded to two decimal places. So option A is the correct answer.


To solve the problem, we first calculate the concentration of acetic acid after dilution. The initial moles of acetic acid are:

\[
\text{Moles of acetic acid} = 0.05 \, \text{M} \times 0.02 \, \text{L} = 0.001 \, \text{moles}.
\]

After dilution with 20.00 cm³ of water, the total volume is:

\[
\text{Total volume} = 20.00 \, \text{cm}^3 + 20.00 \, \text{cm}^3 = 40.00 \, \text{cm}^3 = 0.04 \, \text{L}.
\]

The new concentration of acetic acid is:

\[
\text{Concentration of acetic acid} = \frac{0.001 \, \text{moles}}{0.04 \, \text{L}} = 0.025 \, \text{M}.
\]

### At 25% Titration
At 25% titration, 2.5 cm³ of 0.1 M NaOH is added. The moles of NaOH added are:

\[
\text{Moles of NaOH} = 0.1 \, \text{M} \times 0.0025 \, \text{L} = 0.00025 \, \text{moles}.
\]

Since the reaction between acetic acid and NaOH is 1:1, 0.00025 moles of acetic acid are neutralized, leaving:

\[
\text{Moles of acetic acid remaining} = 0.001 - 0.00025 = 0.00075 \, \text{moles}.
\]

The moles of acetate ion (\( \text{CH}_3\text{COO}^- \)) formed are:

\[
\text{Moles of acetate ion} = 0.00025 \, \text{moles}.
\]

The total volume of the solution is:

\[
\text{Total volume} = 40.00 \, \text{cm}^3 + 2.5 \, \text{cm}^3 = 42.5 \, \text{cm}^3 = 0.0425 \, \text{L}.
\]

The concentrations of acetic acid and acetate ion are:

\[
[\text{HA}] = \frac{0.00075}{0.0425} = 0.017647 \, \text{M}, \quad [\text{A}^-] = \frac{0.00025}{0.0425} = 0.005882 \, \text{M}.
\]

Using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation:

\[
\text{pH} = \text{p}K_a + \log \left( \frac{[\text{A}^-]}{[\text{HA}]} \right),
\]

where \( \text{p}K_a = -\log(1.85 \times 10^{-5}) \approx 4.73 \). Substituting the values:

\[
\text{pH} = 4.73 + \log \left( \frac{0.005882}{0.017647} \right).
\]

The ratio \( \frac{[\text{A}^-]}{[\text{HA}]} = \frac{0.005882}{0.017647} \approx 0.3333 \), and \( \log(0.3333) \approx -0.477 \). Thus:

\[
\text{pH} = 4.73 - 0.477 = 4.253 \approx 4.26.
\]

### At Equivalence Point
At the equivalence point, all the acetic acid is neutralized, forming acetate ions. The moles of acetate ion are:

\[
\text{Moles of acetate ion} = 0.001 \, \text{moles}.
\]

The total volume of the solution is:

\[
\text{Total volume} = 40.00 \, \text{cm}^3 + 10.00 \, \text{cm}^3 = 50.00 \, \text{cm}^3 = 0.05 \, \text{L}.
\]

The concentration of acetate ion is:

\[
[\text{A}^-] = \frac{0.001}{0.05} = 0.02 \, \text{M}.
\]

Acetate ion hydrolyzes in water:

\[
\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^- + \text{H}_2\text{O} \leftrightarrow \text{CH}_3\text{COOH} + \text{OH}^-.
\]

The equilibrium constant for this reaction is \( K_b = \frac{K_w}{K_a} = \frac{1.0 \times 10^{-14}}{1.85 \times 10^{-5}} \approx 5.41 \times 10^{-10} \). Let \( [\text{OH}^-] = x \). Then:

\[
K_b = \frac{x^2}{[\text{A}^-] - x}.
\]

Since \( K_b \) is very small, \( x \ll 0.02 \), so:

\[
x^2 \approx K_b \cdot [\text{A}^-] = (5.41 \times 10^{-10}) \cdot 0.02 = 1.082 \times 10^{-11}.
\]

\[
x = \sqrt{1.082 \times 10^{-11}} \approx 3.29 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{M}.
\]

The pOH is:

\[
\text{pOH} = -\log(3.29 \times 10^{-6}) \approx 5.487.
\]

The pH is:

\[
\text{pH} = 14 - \text{pOH} = 14 - 5.487 = 8.513 \approx 8.52.
\]

### Final Answer
The pH at 25% titration is approximately 4.26, and the pH at the equivalence point is approximately 8.52. The correct option is:

**Answer: A**
