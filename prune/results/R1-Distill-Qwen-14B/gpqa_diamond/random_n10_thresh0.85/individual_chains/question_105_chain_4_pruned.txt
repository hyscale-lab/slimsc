Okay, so I have this astronomy problem in front of me. Let me try to figure it out step by step. Hmm, the question is about a star with some dark spots and how that affects the brightness measurements. And it's comparing that to what an exoplanet would do. Interesting.

So, the star has a radius equal to the Sun's. Let's see, the Sun's radius is about 7e5 km, but maybe I don't need the exact number. One hemisphere is covered in dark spots with a 20% filling factor. Wait, filling factor is the fraction of the hemisphere covered, right? So 20% of one hemisphere is spots. Oh wait, but the star's surface is a sphere, so the area would be 20% of half the star's surface. Or wait, the filling factor is the fraction of the visible hemisphere that's covered. So when the star rotates, we see different parts — but in this case, only one hemisphere is spotty. So when we look at the star, only part of it is spotted.

The star's effective temperature is 6000 K, and the spots are 1000 K cooler. So the spots are at 5000 K. Because the temperature difference is 1000 K. So spots are 5000 K.

The problem says that the observed brightness variations look like those from an exoplanet. So when the star isn't spotty, what exoplanet radius would produce the same light curve amplitude? I'm to find Rpl/Rstar.

I think I need to calculate the change in brightness when a planet transits the star. The transit method measures the dip in brightness as a planet passes in front. The dip is proportional to (Rp/Rstar)^2, because the area blocked is the area of the planet's disk over the star's disk. So the fractional change is (Rp/Rstar)^2 times the star's flux.

Wait, but in this problem, the brightness variations are due to the spots. So when the star rotates, the spotted hemisphere comes into view and then moves away. But since only one hemisphere is spotted, maybe the brightness variation is due to the spots rotating in and out of view. But the question says that the situation can closely resemble an exoplanet. So maybe the spots cause a similar dip in brightness as a planet would.

Wait, but the question is a bit different. It says, if the star wasn't covered by spots, what exoplanet radius would produce the same amplitude in the light curve. So I need to compute the brightness variation caused by the spots and then find the planet radius that would cause the same variation.

So first, let's model the brightness variation due to the spots. The star's total brightness without any spots would be based on its effective temperature. When spots are present, they're cooler, so the total brightness decreases as the spots rotate into view.

The star's luminosity is L = 4πR²σTeff^4. The spots have an area A = 0.2 * (π R² / 2 ), since the filling factor is 20% of one hemisphere. Wait, no: the star's surface area is 4πR². One hemisphere
