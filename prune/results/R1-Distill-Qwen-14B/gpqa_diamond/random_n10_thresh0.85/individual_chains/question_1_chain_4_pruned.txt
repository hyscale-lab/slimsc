Okay, so I've got this question about quantum states and their energy differences. Hmm, the question says that two states have energies E1 and E2 with lifetimes of 10^-9 seconds and 10^-8 seconds. We need to figure out the energy difference that allows them to be clearly distinguished.

Wait, I remember something about the uncertainty principle. Oh right, the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle. It relates the uncertainty in energy and the uncertainty in time. The formula I think is ΔE * Δt ≈ ħ/2, where ħ is the reduced Planck constant. But wait, how does that apply here?

So, each quantum state has a certain lifetime, which is like the uncertainty in time Δt. The energy uncertainty ΔE is related to the lifetime. A shorter lifetime means a larger energy uncertainty, right? Because if the state doesn't last very long, we can't know its energy very precisely.

The goal is to have the energy difference between E1 and E2 be larger than the sum of their individual uncertainties. Otherwise, they might not be distinguishable. So the difference ΔE should be bigger than the uncertainty from each state.

Let me think about the formula again. The energy uncertainty ΔE for each state would be roughly ħ divided by the lifetime. So ΔE ≈ ħ / τ, where τ is the lifetime.

I think the reduced Planck constant ħ is about 1.0545718e-34 J·s. But sometimes people use units where ħ is 1, but I guess in this case, we need to compute it properly.

Wait, but the options are given in electron volts (eV). So I need to convert whatever calculation I do into eV.

First, let's compute ΔE for each state.

For the first state with τ1 = 1e-9 seconds:
ΔE1 ≈ ħ / τ1 = (1.0545718e-34 J·s) / (1e-9 s) = 1.0545718e-25 J.

Now, to convert J to eV. I remember 1 eV is approximately 1.60218e-19 joules. So:

ΔE1 = 1.05457e-25 J / (1.60218e-19 J/eV) ≈ 6.58e-7 eV.

Wait, wait, wait. Let me calculate that again. 1e-25 divided by 1.6e-19 is roughly (1/1.6) * 1e-6 ≈ 0.625e-6, which is about 6.25e-7 eV. Hmm, that's about 0.625 micro-eV, I think.

For the second state, τ2 = 1e-8 seconds:
ΔE2 ≈ ħ / τ2 = 1.05457e-34 / 1e-8 = 1.05457e-26 J.

Convert to eV:
1.05457e-26 J / 1.60218e-19 J/eV ≈ 6.58e-8 eV.

So the energy uncertainties are about 6.58e-7 eV and 6.58e-8 eV for the two states.

Wait, but how does this help? Because the energy difference between E1 and E2 should be larger than the sum of these uncertainties, perhaps? Or maybe just each of them individually? I'm a bit confused here.

Alternatively, maybe the energy difference needs to be larger than the uncertainty in energy of each state. Because if the energy difference is smaller than the uncertainty, you can't distinguish them. So the difference ΔE must be greater than each individual ΔE.

Wait, let's think about the first state. Its ΔE is ~6.58e-7 eV. The second state's ΔE is ~6.58e-8 eV. So the maximum uncertainty we have to consider is the larger one (6.58e-7 eV) because if the difference is greater than that, it'll definitely be distinguishable.

Wait, but wait. No, because each state has its own uncertainty. I think the correct approach is that the energy resolution, or the minimum detectable difference, is the sum of the uncertainties of each state. Or perhaps the maximum uncertainty is the uncertainty of the longer lived state, which has a smaller ΔE.

Wait, no. Because the lifetimes are τ1 and τ2. The state with τ1=1e-9 s has a larger ΔE than the state with τ2=1e-8 s. Because τ is longer, ΔE is smaller.

Wait, so the first state has a larger ΔE (less precise energy), the second state has a smaller ΔE (more precise). So, when comparing the two, the energy difference must be larger than the sum of the individual uncertainties, but I'm not entirely certain.

Alternatively, perhaps the energy difference must be greater than the maximum of the two uncertainties. Because if the difference is larger than both, you can tell them apart. Because if the difference is less than the uncertainty of one of them, you can't
