Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a relativistic harmonic oscillator. Hmm, let's see what it says. The question is about finding the maximum speed, v_max, of a mass attached to a spring in a relativistic scenario. The options are a bit complicated, but I'll try to work through it step by step.

Alright, I remember that in classical mechanics, a harmonic oscillator has a maximum speed determined by its amplitude and the spring constant. The equation for the maximum speed is v_max = sqrt(kA²/m), right? But wait, this is a relativistic case, so I can't use the classical formulas directly because they don't account for relativistic effects.

So in relativity, the total energy of a particle isn't just kinetic; it's also related to its rest mass energy. The total energy E is gamma times m c squared, where gamma is the Lorentz factor, 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²). But how does that apply here?

Wait, the oscillator obeys Hooke's law, F = -kx. So the potential energy is (1/2)kx² as usual. But since it's relativistic, the kinetic energy can't be treated classically. Instead, the total energy is the sum of relativistic kinetic energy and the potential energy from the spring.

Hmm, but wait, in the relativistic harmonic oscillator, is the potential energy still (1/2)kx²? I think so because Hooke's law is given, so the potential is as usual. But the kinetic energy isn't (1/2)mv² anymore. Relativistic kinetic energy is (gamma - 1)mc².

So the total energy E at any point is the sum of the kinetic and potential energies. At maximum displacement, x = A, the velocity is zero, so all the energy is potential. At the equilibrium point, x=0, the velocity is maximum, so all energy is kinetic. Wait, but in reality, for a harmonic oscillator, the energy is shared between kinetic and potential, but maximum speed occurs when all potential energy is converted to kinetic.

Ah, right, so when the oscillator is at x=0, the potential energy is zero, and the kinetic energy is maximum. So the total energy E is equal to the maximum kinetic energy.

So E = K_max = (gamma - 1) m c².

But the total energy is also the potential energy at x=A, which is (1/2)k A². So we can set those equal:

(1/2) k A² = (gamma - 1) m c².

But gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v_max²/c²), right? So substituting that in:

(1/2) k A² = [ (1/sqrt(1 - v_max²/c²)) - 1 ] m c².

Hmm, let's write this equation:

(1/2) k A² = (1/sqrt(1 - (v_max/c)^2) - 1) m c².

I can rewrite this as:

(1/2) (k A²) / (m c²) ) = (1/sqrt(1 - (v_max/c)^2) - 1).

Let me set u = v_max/c for simplicity. Then the equation becomes:

( k A² )/(2 m c² ) = [ 1/sqrt(1 - u²) - 1 ]

Let me rearrange this:

1/sqrt(1 - u²) = 1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²)

So,

sqrt(1 - u²) = 1/(1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²))

Wait, taking reciprocal on both sides:

sqrt(1 - u²) = 1 / [ 1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²) ]

Square both sides:

1 - u² = 1 / [ 1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²) ]^2

So,

u² = 1 - [1 / (1 + (k A²/(2 m c²)))^2 ]

Hmm, let's compute that. Let me denote (k A²/(2 m c²)) as some variable, say, alpha. So alpha = (k A²)/(2 m c²).

Then,

u² = 1 - 1/(1 + alpha)^2.

I can write this as:

u² = [ (1 + alpha)^2 - 1 ] / (1 + alpha)^2

Expanding numerator:

(1 + 2 alpha + alpha² - 1 ) = 2 alpha + alpha²

So,

u² = (2 alpha + alpha²) / (1 + alpha)^2

Factor numerator:

alpha (2 + alpha) / (1 + alpha)^2.

Hmm, but perhaps I can simplify further.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to compute v_max in terms of alpha. Let me see.

Wait, alpha is (k A²)/(2 m c²). So,

u = v_max/c = sqrt(1 - [1/(1 + alpha)]^2 )

Wait, let me compute 1/(1 + alpha)^2. So,

u² = 1 - [1/(1 + alpha)^2 ]

So,

u² = ( (1 + alpha)^2 - 1 ) / (1 + alpha)^2 )

Which is:

(1 + 2 alpha + alpha² - 1 ) / (1 + alpha)^2

= (2 alpha + alpha²) / (1 + alpha)^2

= alpha (2 + alpha) / (1 + alpha)^2.

Hmm, perhaps I can factor this differently. Let me factor alpha out in the numerator:

alpha (2 + alpha) = alpha ( (1 + alpha) + 1 )

Wait, maybe not. Alternatively, perhaps I should express this in terms of u.

Alternatively, perhaps I can manipulate the equation to find u in terms of alpha.

Wait, another approach: let's let (1 + alpha) = [ (1 + alpha) ].

We can write:

sqrt(1 - u²) = 1/(1 + alpha)

So,

1 - u² = 1/(1 + alpha)^2

Rearranged:

u² = 1 - 1/(1 + alpha)^2

= [ (1 + alpha)^2 - 1 ] / (1 + alpha)^2

Which gives:

u² = [ (1 + 2 alpha + alpha²) -1 ] / (1 + alpha)^2

= (2 alpha + alpha² ) / (1 + alpha)^2

Factor numerator:

alpha (2 + alpha) / (1 + alpha)^2.

Wait, but I'm not sure if this is the most helpful approach. Let me see if I can solve for u in terms of alpha.

Alternatively, perhaps I can take square roots. Let's see.

Wait, u² = [alpha (2 + alpha)] / (1 + alpha)^2.

But maybe I should write u in terms of (1 + alpha).

Hmm, perhaps this is getting too complicated. Let me think about the options given.

Looking at the options, option B is v_max = c * sqrt( 1 + 1/(1 - (k A²)/(2 m c²)) )

Wait, that seems a bit off, but let's see.

Wait, perhaps I can find an expression for u in terms of alpha.

Alternatively, perhaps I can express v_max as:

v_max = c * sqrt( [2 alpha + alpha^2] / (1 + alpha)^2 )

Which is:

v_max = c * sqrt( alpha (2 + alpha) ) / (1 + alpha )

Wait, but I'm not sure if that matches any of the options.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm approaching this the wrong way. Maybe I should consider relativistic energy conservation.

Let me try another approach. The total energy at maximum displacement (x=A) is all potential, E = (1/2) k A^2.

At x=0, the kinetic energy is (gamma - 1) m c^2. So,

gamma = (E + m c^2 ) / (m c^2 )

Wait, no: E is the total energy, which is gamma m c^2.

Wait, no, the total energy is gamma m c^2 = (1/2) k A^2 + K.

Wait, no, because at x=0, all energy is kinetic. So, E = K = (gamma - 1) m c^2.

Wait, no, wait. The total energy E is (gamma) m c^2, which includes the rest mass energy. So,

(gamma) m c^2 = (1/2) k A^2.

Because at x=A, the velocity is zero, so kinetic energy is zero, and the energy is all potential. At x=0, the potential is zero, and the energy is kinetic (gamma - 1) m c².

Wait, no, the total energy is the sum of kinetic and potential. So,

E = (gamma) m c^2 = (1/2) k A^2 + K,

where K is the kinetic energy at any point.

But at x=0, the potential is zero, so E = K = (gamma -1) m c^2.

So,

( gamma ) m c^2 = (1/2) k A^2 + (gamma -1) m c^2

Wait, that can't be right. Let me think again.

No, that's not correct. The total energy E is the sum of the potential and kinetic energies. So at x=A, E = (1/2) k A^2. At x=0, E = (gamma -1) m c^2.

But that implies:

(1/2) k A^2 = (gamma -1) m c^2.

So,

gamma = ( (1/2) k A^2 )/( m c^2 ) + 1.

Which is,

gamma = 1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 )

Which is the same as earlier.

So,

gamma = 1 + (k A²)/(2 m c² )

So,

gamma = 1 + alpha, where alpha = (k A²)/(2 m c² )

So,

gamma = 1 + alpha.

But gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - u^2 ), where u = v_max / c.

So,

1/sqrt(1 - u^2) = 1 + alpha.

Take reciprocal,

sqrt(1 - u^2) = 1/(1 + alpha).

Square both sides,

1 - u² = 1/(1 + alpha)^2.

So,

u² = 1 - [1/(1 + alpha)^2 ]

Which can be written as,

u² = [ (1 + alpha)^2 - 1 ] / (1 + alpha)^2.

Expand numerator,

(1 + 2 alpha + alpha² -1 ) = 2 alpha + alpha².

So,

u^2 = (2 alpha + alpha² ) / (1 + alpha)^2.

Factor numerator,

alpha (2 + alpha ) / (1 + alpha)^2.

Hmm, perhaps I can factor this expression. Let me compute:

(2 + alpha) = (1 + alpha) + 1.

Wait, so:

alpha ( (1+alpha) + 1 ) / (1 + alpha)^2.

= [ alpha (1 + alpha) + alpha ] / (1 + alpha)^2.

= [ alpha (1 + alpha) ]/(1 + alpha)^2 + alpha/(1 + alpha)^2.

= alpha/(1 + alpha) + alpha/(1 + alpha)^2.

Not sure if that helps. Alternatively, perhaps I can factor 2 + alpha differently.

Wait, another approach: perhaps I can write the numerator as (1 + alpha)^2 - (1 - alpha)^2, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps I can factor the denominator.

Wait, (1 + alpha)^2 = 1 + 2 alpha + alpha^2.

So,

u² = [ alpha (2 + alpha) ] / (1 + alpha)^2.

Wait, I can write this as:

alpha (2 + alpha) / (1 + alpha)^2 = [ alpha (2 + alpha) ] / (1 + alpha)^2.

Hmm, not seeing a clear simplification.

Wait, perhaps I can write 2 + alpha as (1 + alpha) + 1.

So,

[ alpha (1 + alpha + 1) ] / (1 + alpha)^2.

= [ alpha (1 + alpha) + alpha ] / (1 + alpha)^2.

= [ alpha (1 + alpha) ]/(1 + alpha)^2 + alpha/(1 + alpha)^2.

= alpha/(1 + alpha) + alpha/(1 + alpha)^2.

Hmm, not sure if that's helpful.

Alternatively, perhaps I can write 2 + alpha = (1 + alpha) + 1, but not sure.

Wait, another approach: let's solve for u.

u^2 = [ 2 alpha + alpha^2 ] / (1 + alpha)^2.

= alpha (2 + alpha) / (1 + alpha)^2.

Take square root,

u = sqrt( alpha (2 + alpha) ) / (1 + alpha )

Hmm, but I'm not sure how this helps in matching the options.

Looking back at the options, option B is v_max = c * sqrt( 1 + [1/(1 - (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 )) ] )

Wait, let's compute that.

Option B: sqrt(1 + 1/(1 - (k A²)/(2 m c² )) )

Let me compute the term inside:

1 + [1/(1 - (k A²)/(2 m c^2 )) ]

= [ (1 - (k A²)/(2 m c^2 )) + 1 ] / (1 - (k A²)/(2 m c^2 ))

= [ 2 - (k A²)/(2 m c^2 ) ] / (1 - (k A²)/(2 m c^2 )).

So,

sqrt( [2 - (k A²/(2 m c² )) ] / [1 - (
