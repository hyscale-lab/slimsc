Okay, I've got this astronomy question here. Let's see what it's about. So, the question says that in a specific region, the number of stars varies with parallax as 1 over parallax to the fifth power. Hmm, I remember that parallax is related to distance. The formula I think is parallax (in parsecs) is 1 divided by distance. So, plx = 1/r, where r is the distance in parsecs.

Wait, the question is about how the number of stars changes with distance. So, the number of stars N is proportional to 1/(plx)^5. Let me write that down: N ∝ 1/(plx)^5. Since plx is 1/r, substituting that in, I get N ∝ (r)^5. Oh wait, because 1/(1/r)^5 is r^5. So N is proportional to r^5. But wait, that's the number of stars per unit volume or per what?

Wait, the question says "with distance (per unit range of distance, r)". So, it's the number of stars in a certain distance range, like between r and r + dr. I think the number of stars in a thin shell at distance r would be proportional to the surface area at that distance multiplied by the thickness dr. Wait, but how does that tie into the given relation with parallax?

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider the number density. So, the number of stars per unit volume might be proportional to r^5. But let me think again. Oh, wait, the variation is given as N ∝ 1/(plx)^5, and plx is 1/r. So substituting, N ∝
