Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to work through it. Let me read it again.

The question is about a star with the same radius as the Sun. One hemisphere is covered in dark spots with a 20% filling factor. The star's effective temperature is 6000K, and the spots are 1000K cooler. Because the star is only spotty on one hemisphere, when it rotates, the brightness changes due to these spots coming into view and then hiding. The problem says this setup can resemble an exoplanet. Now, the question is, what would be the radius of a hypothetical exoplanet to produce the same amplitude in the star's light curve if the star wasn't spotted.

Hmm. So, I think I need to compare the brightness variation caused by the spots to that of an exoplanet transiting the star.

Wait, the problem says if the star wasn't covered by spots, so we're to find the planet radius that would have the same brightness change as the star's spots do. So, the brightness variation from the planet would be similar to that from the spots.

First, I should figure out the amplitude of the brightness variation caused by the spots. Then, figure out what planet radius would cause the same amplitude.

So, the amplitude of the brightness variation is the difference in the star's brightness when the spots are visible versus when they're not. But wait, I'm not sure about the exact formula here.

I remember that the brightness variation (delta F) when a part of the star is covered is given by delta F = (R_spot / R_star)^2 * (T_spot^4 / T_star^4) * (1 - F), where F is the filling factor. Wait, no, maybe F is the fraction of the star covered by spots. Wait, the filling factor is the coverage, right? So F is 0.2 in this case.

Wait, wait. Dark spots are cooler, so when they're facing us, the star appears dimmer. So when the star is rotating, the spots come into view, making the star appear a bit dimmer. So the brightness variation is due to the spots' effect.

So, the variation in flux (F) when the spots are visible is:

F = F0 * (1 - (F_spots * (T_spot^4)/(T_star^4)) )

Wait, no, let me think again. The total flux from the star is the sum of the flux from the spotted regions and the unspotted regions. So when a spot is in view, the flux is:

F_total = F_unspotted + F_spotted.

The unspotted area is (1 - F) of the star's surface, and the spotted area is F of the surface.

Flux is proportional to temperature^4 * area. So,

F_unspotted = (1 - F) * (π R_star²) * (σ T_star^4) / (4π R_star²) ) ? Wait, maybe I should think in terms of the star's total flux.

Wait, the star emits a certain amount of flux, F0, which is σ T^4 multiplied by the surface area. The surface area is 4π R_star². So F0 = σ T_star^4 * 4π R_star² / 4π = σ T_star^4 R_star². Wait, no, more accurately, the flux from the star as seen from Earth is F0 = (σ T_star^4) * (R_star^2 / D^2), where D is distance. But since we're comparing relative variations, D might cancel out.

But when part of the star is covered by spots, the total flux becomes F = F0 (1 - F) * (T_unspotted^4 / T_star^4) + F * (T_spot^4 / T_star^4). Hmm, no, perhaps that's not accurate.

Wait, I think I should model this differently. The unspotted fraction (1-F) of the star emits at T_star^4, and the spotted fraction F emits at T_spot^4. So the total flux when the star is viewed with spots is:

F = F0 * (1 - F) + F * (T_spot^4 / T_star^4) * F0.

Because F0 is the total flux when the entire star is at T_star. So, substituting,

F = F0 [ (1 - F) + F (T_spot^4 / T_star^4) ]

The change in flux when the star is spotted (compared to when there are no spots) is delta F = F - F0.

So, delta F = F0 [ (1 - F) + F (T_spot^4 / T_star^4) - 1 ]

Simplify:

delta F = F0 [ -F + F (T_spot^4 / T_star^4) ]

= F0 * F [ (T_spot^4 / T_star^4) - 1 ]

Which is F0 * F ( (T_spot^4 - T_star^4)/T_star^4 )

But since the spots are cooler, T_spot = T_star - delta T, so T_spot is 5000 K in this case.

Wait, no, the problem says a temperature difference of 1000 K. So T_spot is 6000K - 1000K = 5000K.

Wait, but wait, the star's Teff is 6000K, and the spots are 1000K cooler, so yes, 5000K.

So T_spot is 5000, T_star is 6000.

Compute the term (T_spot^4 / T_star^4).

(5000/6000)^4 = (5/6)^4. Let's compute that:

(5/6) = approx 0.8333.

0.8333^4: let's compute step by step.

0.8333 squared is about 0.6944.

0.6944 squared is around 0.
