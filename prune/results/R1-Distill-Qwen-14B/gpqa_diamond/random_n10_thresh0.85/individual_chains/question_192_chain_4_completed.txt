Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this physics problem about electric fields and conductors. Let me take it step by step. 

The setup is an uncharged spherical conductor with a radius R. Inside it, there's a small spherical cavity with radius r. The center of the cavity is a distance s away from the center of the conductor, and R is bigger than r. Then, a small positive charge +q is placed somewhere inside this cavity. 

The question is about finding the electric field E at a point P outside the conductor. Point P is at a distance L from the conductor's center, and from the cavity's center, it's at a distance l. Also, l and L are both larger than R, and there's an angle θ between l and s.

I remember that when you have charges inside a conductor, the conductor's charges redistribute. But wait, the conductor was initially uncharged. So, when we place a charge inside the cavity, what happens? Oh right, the conductor being neutral, the charges in the conductor will rearrange. The inner surface of the conductor (the part facing the cavity) must induce an equal and opposite charge. Since the cavity has a charge +q, the inner surface of the conductor will have -q. But the conductor itself is neutral, so the outer surface must have a charge +q to balance it out.

Wait, no, wait. Let's think again. The cavity is inside the conductor. The conductor had no net charge. When +q is placed inside the cavity, it induces a -q on the inner surface of the conductor. But since the conductor's total charge is zero, the outer surface must have a charge of +q. So, the conductor's inner surface has -q, and the outer surface has +q. That makes sense because the net charge is zero: (-q) + (+q) = 0.

Now, for the electric field at point P, which is outside the conductor. So, we're looking at a region outside the conductor, which is a distance L from the conductor's center. But the point P is at a distance l from the cavity's center, and the angle between l and s (the displacement from conductor's center to cavity's center) is θ.

I think I need to use Gauss's Law here. Gauss's Law says that the electric flux through a Gaussian surface is Q_enc / ε₀. The Gaussian surface here would be a sphere centered at the conductor's center, with radius L, since P is outside the conductor (L > R). But wait, the conductor's outer surface is at radius R, so the point P is outside, so the Gaussian surface encloses the conductor's entire charge. 

Wait, the conductor's outer surface has charge +q. So, the total charge enclosed by the Gaussian surface (which is outside the conductor) is +q. Therefore, the electric field at point P would be E = (1/(4πε₀)) * (q_enclosed) / (L²). So that would be E = (1/(4πε₀)) * (q) / L². 

But wait, I'm a bit confused because the point P's position relative to the cavity might matter. Because the charge inside the cavity is inside the conductor, but the conductor's redistribution affects the fields. 

Alternatively, maybe you need to consider the field due to the induced charges. But wait, the conductor's outer surface has a charge of +q, so when you're outside the conductor, the electric field is as if all the charge were concentrated at the center. So the field outside is the same as if the charge +q were at the center of the conductor. 

Wait, but the point P isn't necessarily aligned with the center of the conductor and the cavity. The point P is at a distance l from the cavity's center, and the displacement between the centers is s. So, maybe the direction of the field isn't directly radial from the conductor's center. Hmm, but for a spherical conductor, the field outside is radial from the center, regardless of where the charge is inside. Because the induced charges on the inner surface are arranged in a way that the field inside the conductor is zero. 

Wait, let me think again. The conductor is a spherical shell (assuming it's a thick shell, but it's a sphere with a cavity). So the inner surface of the conductor has charge -q, and the outer surface has +q. The field inside the conductor (in the material) is zero. The field in the cavity is due to the charge +q and the induced charges. But the field outside is due to the total charge on the conductor. 

Wait, when you have a charge inside a conductor cavity, the field outside depends only on the total charge on the outside. So, the electric field outside the conductor is the same as if all the charge were concentrated at the center. So, regardless of where the +q is placed inside the cavity, the field outside is as if the charge were at the center of the conductor. 

But wait, the point P is at a distance L from the center of the conductor. So, the electric field would be (1/(4πε₀)) * (q) / L², directed radially outward. So, in magnitude, E = (1/(4πε₀)) * (q)/(L²). Looking at the options, option B says E = (1/(4πε₀)) q/(L²). So that seems correct.

Wait, but what about the position of the point P relative to the cavity? The problem gave l and s with an angle θ between them. Hmm, but wait, when applying Gauss's Law, the Gaussian surface is centered at the conductor's center. So the induced charges on the outer surface would create a field that depends only on the total charge and the distance from the center. So the position of the point P relative to the cavity's position (s and l and θ) may not matter. Because whether the +q is near the center or not, the field outside is as if the +q is at the center. 

Wait, but in reality, the induced charge on the inner surface is -q, but the conductor's material doesn't change the overall field outside. So, the presence of the cavity and the displacement s might not affect the external field. Because the conductor's outer surface charge is +q, and the field outside depends only on that. 

So, even if the point P is at a different position relative to the cavity's center, the field outside will still depend only on the distance L from the conductor's center. So, the answer should be option B. 

Wait, but let's double-check. Suppose the conductor is a sphere, and the charge inside is off-center. For points inside the conductor's material, the field is zero. For points outside, the field is as if all the charge is at the center. So, the position of the charge inside the cavity doesn't affect the external field. So, the external field is only due to the outer surface charge, which is +q. 

So the electric field at point P is E = (1/(4πε₀)) * (q) / L². So the correct answer is option B. 

Looking at the options:

Option B is exactly that. So the answer should be B.


The problem involves an uncharged spherical conductor with a small spherical cavity inside. The conductor has a radius \( R \), and the cavity has a radius \( r \), with its center separated by a distance \( s \) from the center of the conductor. A small positive charge \( +q \) is placed inside the cavity. The goal is to determine the magnitude of the electric field \( E \) at a point \( P \) outside the conductor, which is at a distance \( L \) from the center of the conductor and \( l \) from the center of the cavity. The angle between \( l \) and \( s \) is \( \theta \).

When the charge \( +q \) is placed inside the cavity, it induces a charge \( -q \) on the inner surface of the conductor. Since the conductor is initially uncharged, the outer surface of the conductor must have a charge \( +q \) to maintain charge neutrality. The electric field outside the conductor is determined by the total charge on the outer surface, which is \( +q \), and not by the position of the charge inside the cavity.

Using Gauss's Law, the electric field outside a spherical conductor depends only on the total charge enclosed by a Gaussian surface and the distance from the center of the conductor. For point \( P \), which is outside the conductor at a distance \( L \) from its center, the electric field is given by:

\[
E = \frac{1}{4 \pi \epsilon_0} \frac{q}{L^2}.
\]

The position of \( P \) relative to the cavity (i.e., \( l \), \( s \), and \( \theta \)) does not affect the electric field at \( P \), as the field outside the conductor is determined solely by the total charge on the outer surface and the distance \( L \) from the conductor's center.

Among the given options, the correct expression for the electric field is:

\[
E = \frac{1}{4 \pi \epsilon_0} \frac{q}{L^2}.
\]

This corresponds to **Option B**.

Answer: B
