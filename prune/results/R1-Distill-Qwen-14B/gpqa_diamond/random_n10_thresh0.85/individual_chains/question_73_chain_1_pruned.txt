Okay, so I have this physics problem about two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds, and I need to find the relative speed between them and the total energy of the system. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.

First, the problem states that there are two astronauts with masses 2m and 3m. They're moving at speeds of 0.6c and 0.5c respectively in the same direction, the positive x-axis. So, the first astronaut is moving faster than the second one. Wait, but the question is about their relative speed and the total energy.

Wait, relative speed in relativity isn't as straightforward as subtracting velocities in classical mechanics. Right, because of the relativistic velocity addition formula. So, the relative velocity isn't simply 0.6c - 0.5c = 0.1c. Oh right, that's the classical approach, but relativity doesn't work that way.

The formula for relative velocity when two objects are moving along the same direction is (u - v)/(1 - (uv)/c²), I think. So, u is the velocity of the first astronaut as seen from the stationary frame, and v is the velocity of the second. Wait no, wait. Let me get the formula right. Oh, wait no, the formula for relative velocity in special relativity when both are moving in the same direction is (u - v)/(1 - (u v)/c²). Wait, but which is u and which is v? Oh, because the relative velocity is from the perspective of the second astronaut.

Wait, let's clarify. Suppose astronaut A is moving at u = 0.6c, and astronaut B at v = 0.5c, both in the same direction. So, the relative speed of A as seen from B is (u - v)/(1 - (u v)/(c²)). So u is 0.6c, v is 0.5c. Let me plug that in.

So, numerator: 0.6c - 0.5c = 0.1c. Denominator: 1 - (0.6c * 0.5c)/(c²) = 1 - (0.3c²)/(c²) = 1 - 0.3 = 0.7.

So, relative speed is (0.1c) / 0.7 ≈ 0.142857c, which is about 0.14c. Hmm, looking at the options, options C and D have 0.14c as their v_rel
