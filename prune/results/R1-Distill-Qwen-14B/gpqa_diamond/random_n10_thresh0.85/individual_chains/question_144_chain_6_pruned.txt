Okay, so I have this physics problem here about meson resonance decay. Hmm, I remember that mesons are subatomic particles, and when they're produced, they don't live very long before decaying. The question is about finding the mean decay distance, right? 

The given data is production energy E_X = 8 GeV, mass m_X = 1.2 GeV, and width Γ_X = 320 MeV. The options are A, B, C, D with different distances in meters. 

Wait, I think the mean decay distance is related to the particle's lifetime. Because the mean lifetime would determine how far it travels before decaying. Oh right, the formula for mean decay distance is something like (c * τ), where c is the speed of light and τ is the mean lifetime. 

But how do I find τ? Oh wait, τ is the inverse of the decay rate. And the decay rate Γ is related to the width. I think Γ is the total decay width, which is related to the mean lifetime by Γ = ħ / τ. So τ = ħ / Γ. 

Wait, but wait, I'm a bit confused. Because the decay width Γ is given, but I also remember that in particle physics, the width is related to the lifetime via Γ = ħ / τ. So τ = ħ / Γ. 

But wait, the production energy is 8 GeV. How does that come into play? I'm trying to remember if the energy affects the mean decay distance. Oh, wait, maybe the energy affects the velocity of the meson. Because the decay distance depends on how fast the meson is moving. So the speed of the meson is an important factor here. 

So the meson is produced with energy E_X, which is higher than its rest mass m_X. So it's moving relativistically. So I need to compute the velocity of the meson based on its energy. 

The energy of a relativistic particle is given by E = γ m c², where γ is the Lorentz factor. So γ = E / (m c²). Wait, but E is given in GeV, m in GeV/c², so maybe I can compute γ directly. Let me see. 

Wait, E_X is 8 GeV, and m_X is 1.2 GeV/c². So γ = E_X / (m_X c²) (divided by m_X c² because E = γ m c²). Wait, but E is already in units that include c²? Wait, let me think about units. In particle physics, people often use natural units where c=1 and ħ=1, so energies and masses are in the same units. So m_X is 1.2 GeV/c², but when E is in GeV, and m_X in GeV/c², to get γ, which is dimensionless, I think you do γ = E_X (GeV) / (m_X (GeV/c²) * c^2). But with c=1 in those units, so maybe it's just E_X / m_X. 

Wait, perhaps it's better to compute the velocity first. Let me think. The energy E is the total energy, which is γ m c². So γ = E/(m c²). But since in natural units, c=1, so γ = E/(m). So E is 8 GeV, m is 1.2 GeV/c². Wait, but when you have E in GeV and m in GeV/c², you need to account for the units. Maybe it's better to convert everything into the same system. 

Alternatively, perhaps the velocity beta (β = v/c) can be found using the energy. The relativistic relation is E^2 = (p c)^2 + (m c^2)^2. So p is the momentum, which is γ m v. Hmm, maybe I can find β from E and m. 

Wait, another approach: For a particle moving at speed v, the mean lifetime observed in the lab frame is longer than the proper lifetime by a factor of gamma. So the mean lifetime is gamma times the proper lifetime. Oh wait, no, wait. The proper lifetime τ is the lifetime in the rest frame. The observed lifetime τ' is γ τ. So the mean decay distance is c τ' = c γ τ. 

But how do I find τ? Because
