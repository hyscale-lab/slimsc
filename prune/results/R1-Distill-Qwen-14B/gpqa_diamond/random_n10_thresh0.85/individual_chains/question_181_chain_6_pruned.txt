Okay, so I've got this question about neutrino flux from the Sun, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to think it through. Let me read the question again.

The question is about the Sun's neutrino production. It says that the pp-III branch suddenly stopped about 8.5 minutes ago. All other reactions are as usual. We need to find the ratio of the flux in two energy bands: band1 is 700-800 keV and band2 is 800-900 keV. The options are A to D, with various ratios.

Hmm, I remember that the pp chain is a major process in the Sun's core for producing energy. The pp-III branch is a part of this chain. Oh wait, the pp chain has different branches. The main one, pp-I, produces protons and electrons, and then eventually builds up to carbon and higher elements. But pp-III is a branch where three protons combine to make helium-3, I think. So if the pp-III branch stops, that affects the production of certain neutrinos.

Wait, neutrinos in the Sun are mainly produced via the proton-proton chain. The main types are the electron neutrinos, and they come from different processes. The pp-I branch produces more high-energy neutrinos, while the pp-III branch... I'm not too sure. Oh wait, the pp-III branch is part of the main pp chain, so stopping it would affect the overall neutrino flux.

Wait, the pp chain in the Sun's core has a few steps. The initial step is two protons fusing to form deuterium, releasing a positron and a neutrino. Then, this deuterium can either combine with another proton (pp-I) to form helium-3 and more particles, or it can undergo other reactions. The pp-III branch might involve the formation of helium-3, which then combines with another helium-3 to form carbon-6, right? Or is that the CNO cycle? Maybe I'm mixing things up.

Wait, no, the CNO cycle is a different fusion process. The main pp chain produces helium-4. The pp-III branch is one of the steps where two helium-3 nuclei combine to form helium-4 and two protons, emitting positrons and neutrinos. Oh wait, no, that's more like the main pp chain's later steps.

Wait, maybe I should think about the neutrino production in the Sun. The primary source is the proton-proton chain, and the main neutrinos are the electron neutrinos. The pp-III branch is a part where three protons combine to form helium-3, right? So if the pp-III branch stops, that would mean that this particular reaction isn't happening anymore.

But wait, when the pp-III branch stops, how does that affect the overall production of neutrinos? Because in the pp chain, each proton-proton fusion produces a neutrino. So if the pp-III branch is part of that, stopping it would reduce the number of neutrinos produced from that branch.

But wait, the question says that the pp-III branch stopped, so all other reactions remain. So the rest of the pp chain is still going. So other parts, like pp-I, are still active. So the neutrino production from the pp-I branch would continue, but pp-III would stop.

But how does that affect the neutrino flux? The flux is the number of neutr
