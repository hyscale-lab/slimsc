Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds, and I need to find their relative speed and the total energy of the system. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think it through.

First, the problem states that the two astronauts have masses 2m and 3m. They're moving at speeds of 0.6c and 0.5c, respectively, in the positive x-direction. So, my goal is to find two things: the relative speed between them and the total energy of the system.

Wait, relative speed in relativity isn't as straightforward as just subtracting their speeds. Oh right, you have to use the velocity addition formula from special relativity. The formula is (v1 - v2)/(1 - (v1*v2)/(c²)). Let me make sure I get that right. So, astronaut A is moving at 0.6c, and astronaut B at 0.5c. But since both are in the same direction, the relative speed would be A's speed minus B's speed, but adjusted for relativity.

Wait, no, wait. The problem is a bit ambiguous. Are both moving in the same direction, or opposite? The question says "in the positive x-direction, respectively," so same direction. So, astronaut A is moving at 0.6c, and astronaut B at 0.5c. So from A's perspective, what's the speed of B? Or vice versa.

Wait, relative velocity is a bit tricky. Let me think. The formula is: u' = (v - u)/(1 - (v u)/c²). Hmm, so if the two objects are moving in the same direction, say from the perspective of the one moving slower, the other is moving a bit faster. Wait, let me get the formula correctly. Suppose from the perspective of astronaut A (moving at 0.6c), what is the speed of astronaut B (0.5c in the same direction)? Because astronaut B is moving slower than A, so from A's frame, B is moving backward? Or am I getting this wrong?

Wait, no. Let me think again. Both are moving in the same direction, but at different speeds. From the perspective of astronaut A (0.6c), what is the speed of astronaut B, who is moving at 0.5c in the same direction. So, in the lab frame, A is moving faster than B. So from A's frame, B is moving backward with a speed. Or maybe forward but slower. Wait, no, because in the lab frame, B is at 0.5c, same direction as A's 0.6c. So from A's frame, I think B is moving backward because if you're moving faster, the other object's speed is subtracted. Wait, no. Let me use the formula.

So, the formula is u' = (u - v) / [1 - (u v)/(c²)]. Wait, wait, because u is the velocity of the object in the original frame, and v is the velocity of the frame you're moving to. So, from A's frame, which is moving at v = 0.6c, what is the velocity of B, which is u = 0.5c in the lab frame.

So substituting, u' = (0.5c - 0.6c) / [1 - (0.5c * 0.6c)/(c²)].

Calculating numerator: 0.5c minus 0.6c is -0.1c. Denominator: 1 - (0.3c²)/c² = 1 - 0.3 = 0.7.

So u' is (-0.1c) / 0.7 ≈ -0.1428c. The negative sign indicates direction, which in this case would be negative x-direction. So the relative speed is 0.1428c, which is approximately 0.14c. So that's the relative speed. That would match option C or D, which have 0.14c.

Wait, but wait. The problem says "relative speed." Speed is scalar, so it should be the magnitude. So 0.14c would be the correct relative speed. So that's the first part.

Now for the total energy of the system. Hmm. The total energy would be the sum of the relativistic energies of each astronaut. Each astronaut has energy given by gamma * m c².

So for astronaut 1 (mass 2m, speed 0.6c):

Gamma1 = 1 / sqrt(1 - (v²/c²)) = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.36)) = 1/sqrt(0.64) = 1/0.8 = 1.25.

So energy E1 = gamma1 * m_total * c². Wait, the mass is 2m, so E1 = 1.25 * 2m * c² = 2.5 m c².

Wait, no, wait. Wait, gamma is 1.25, and the rest energy is 2m c² (since it's
