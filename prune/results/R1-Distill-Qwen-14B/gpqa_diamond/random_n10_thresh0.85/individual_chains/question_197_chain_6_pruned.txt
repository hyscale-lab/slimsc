Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. Let me try to work through it step by step. Hmm, the question is about identifying the product when Compound X reacts with red phosphorus and HI. The options are A to D. 

First, let's look at the data given: IR and NMR spectra of Compound X.

Starting with the IR data. The peaks are at 3400â€“2500 cm-1, which broad usually indicates an O-H stretch, like in a carboxylic acid or maybe an alcohol. But wait, the peak at 1720 cm-1 is strong, which is a typical carbonyl (C=O) stretch. That could be from a carboxylic acid, ester, ketone, etc. Then there's a peak around 1610 cm-1 and 1450 cm-1. Those might be C=C stretching vibrations, as they are in the range for aromatic rings or conjugated carbonyls.

Looking at the 1H NMR data: 

- 10.5 ppm (bs, 1H): A broad singlet around 10.5 ppm usually suggests an acidic proton, like that of a carboxylic acid. The 'bs' stands for broad singlet, which fits since carboxylic acids have broad O-H signals.
- 8.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.2 ppm (d, 2H): These are typical of a substituted benzene ring. The doublets suggest a para-substituted aromatic ring because each proton is next to two others, but wait, in a para substitution, each aromatic proton is a doublet. Like, for example, in para-substituted benzene with two substituents, each set of protons (like ortho to substituent) would be a doublet. So maybe we have a para-substituted benzene with two substituents, but wait, the integration is 2H for each. So perhaps two substituents on the benzene, each with two protons, but that doesn't make sense. Wait, no, benzene has six protons. Wait, the integration here is 2H each for two doublets, so that's four protons on the ring. That suggests maybe a 1,4-disubstituted benzene? Like, for example, a ring with two substituents in para positions, each of which is a single group. Wait, but if each substituent has two protons adjacent, that might not fit. Alternatively, maybe it's a benzene ring with two substituents, each in the para position, but each substituent has two protons. Hmm, perhaps it's a para-substituted benzene with another substituent elsewhere. Wait, maybe it's a meta substitution, but that would give more complex splitting. Alternatively, maybe the substituents are in the para position, each causing a pair of protons to split into doublets. 

Wait, another thought: When you have a para-substituted benzene with two substituents, each substituent takes two protons into account. For example, if the substituents are at positions 1 and 4, but each substituent is a group that has two protons, like ethyl groups or something. But that might not fit the NMR data. Alternatively, maybe the substituent is a single group in para, and the rest of the ring has two sets of doublets. Wait, perhaps it's a substituted benzene with two substituents, like a methyl group and another group in the para position. But that would give more complex splitting. Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a carbonyl group, making it para-substituted. Wait, but in that case, the ortho and para protons would have specific shifts. Hmm. 

Looking further, the NMR also shows:

- 2.9 ppm (m, 1H): A multiplet integrating to 1H. That could be a methylene or methine group adjacent to something, maybe a carbonyl group. Or perhaps a CH group attached to something else.
- 1.7 ppm (m, 2H): Another multiplet, likely a CH2 group adjacent to something else, maybe part of a chain.
- 1.4 ppm (d, 3H): A triplet? No, it's a doublet. Wait, a doublet with 3H. That suggests a methyl group attached to something that splits into a doublet. Like a CH2CH(CH3) group, the methyl at the end of a branch. For example, maybe a -CH(CH3)CH2- group. Or perhaps a geminal di-substituted group. Alternatively, maybe a CH3 group attached to a CH which is next to another CH2. Hmm.
- 0.9 ppm (t, 3H): A triplet with 3H at the end of a chain. That suggests a terminal methyl group, like a CH2CH2CH3, where the CH3 is at the end, giving a triplet due to coupling with the adjacent CH2.

Putting this together: the NMR suggests a structure with a benzene ring, a carboxylic acid group (due to the 10.5 ppm peak), and some sort of substituent attached to the ring which involves a CH2CH2CH3 group. 

Wait, the IR has a peak at 1720 cm-1, which could be a carbonyl. A carboxylic acid would have a broad O-H and a carbonyl around 1700. So that fits with the 10.5 ppm peak being the COOH proton.

So the compound might be a benzoic acid derivative. Let's think about the structure.

The NMR shows a benzene ring with substituents. Let's say in the para position. One substituent is the COOH group, and the other substituent is an ethyl group or perhaps a longer chain.

Wait, looking at the substituents on the benzene:

The two doublets at 8.0 and
