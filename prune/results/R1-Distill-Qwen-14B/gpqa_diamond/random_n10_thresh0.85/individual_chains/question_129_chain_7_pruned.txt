Okay, so I need to figure out what compound E is from all this reaction information. Let's start breaking it down step by step.

First, looking at the reaction steps:

1. Compound A reacts with HCN to form compound B.
2. Compound B is reduced with H2 and Pd to form compound C.
3. Compound C reacts with HNO2 to form compound D.
4. Compound D loses an inert gas to form compound E.

Hmm, and then there are some hints. Let's look at them.

Hint a says that compound A, when reacted with an unknown phosphorous ylide, forms 1,2-dimethyl-4-(propan-2-ylidene)cyclopentane. I'm a bit rusty on ylides, but I remember that they're used in alkylation reactions, especially in the formation of alkenes. Phosphorous ylides like the Wittig reagent. So, the Wittig reaction forms alkenes by reacting with aldehydes or ketones. So, if A reacts with a Wittig reagent to form that compound, that suggests that A is a carbonyl compound. Wait, looking at the product structure: 1,2-dimethyl-4-(propan-2-ylidene)cyclopentane. The "propan-2-ylidene" part is a substituent attached via a double bond. So, the ylide adds a propan-2-ylidene group to A, which is a ketone or aldehyde.

So, A must have a carbonyl group. The Wittig reagent would attack the carbonyl, forming an alkene. So, let's think about the structure. The product is a cyclopentane ring with substituents. So, perhaps A is a cyclic ketone. For example, cyclopentanone or something similar.

Wait, but the product after Wittig is 1,2-dimethyl-4-(propan-2-ylidene)cyclopentane. Let me draw this mentally. The cyclopentane has a substituent at position 4, which is the propan-2-ylidene group. So, the Wittig adds a CH2-C(CH3)2 group, but wait, propan-2-ylidene would be (CH3)2C=, so that's a ylid (a carbanion with a double bond). So when A (a carbonyl) reacts with this ylide, we get an alkene.

So, if A is a ketone, like cyclopentanone, but with substituents, perhaps. Let's think about the structure of A. If the product after Wittig has two methyl groups (1,2-dimethyl) and the substituent at 4, then maybe the starting carbonyl has substituents at positions 1 and 2, and the ylide adds to position 4.

Wait, maybe the ketone in A is in a position such that the ylide adds to it, creating the double bond at position 4. Alternatively, perhaps A is a diketone? Not sure. Maybe I should consider that A is a cyclic ketone with some substituents.

Alternatively, perhaps A is a cyclopentan
