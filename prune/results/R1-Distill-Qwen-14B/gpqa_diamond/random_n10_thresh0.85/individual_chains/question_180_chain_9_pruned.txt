Okay, so I've got this physics problem here. Let me try to work through it step by step. Hmm, the question is about calculating the minimum energy of a system of charges. Let me read it again.

So there's an isolated system of 13 identical particles, each with charge 2e. Oh wait, 2e is twice the elementary charge, right? The mass is negligible, so I don't have to worry about kinetic energy or anything like that. 

Twelve of these charges are constrained to stay at 2 meters from a point P. The 13th charge is fixed at P. I need to find the minimum energy of the system. Oh, energy in an electrostatic system usually refers to the potential energy between the charges.

Wait, but since the 13th charge is fixed at P, and the other twelve are at 2 meters away, I guess the potential energy comes from the interactions between the charges. But I'm a bit confused about how to set this up.

I remember that the electrostatic potential energy between two point charges is given by Coulomb's law formula: U = (k * q1 * q2) / r, where k is Coulomb's constant, approximately 8.988×10^9 N·m²/C².

But here, there are multiple charges. So I think I need to calculate the potential energy for each pair and sum them all up. But wait, since all the charges are identical, maybe there's a smarter way to do this without calculating each pair individually.

Let me think. The system consists of 13 charges. The 13th is fixed at point P, and the other 12 are each at a distance of 2 meters from P. So each of the 12 charges is a distance of 2m from the 13th charge. But what about the distances between the 12 charges themselves? Oh, wait, the problem says the 12 are constrained to stay at 2m from P. So their positions are on a sphere of radius 2m, but their exact positions relative to each other aren't specified. Hmm, but for minimum energy, I think the charges would arrange themselves in a way that minimizes the potential energy. Since all charges are positive (since each is 2e), they would repel each other, so the potential energy would be minimized when they are as far apart as possible. But wait, perhaps in this problem, the exact arrangement of the 12 charges doesn't matter because the problem is considering the potential energy due to the fixed charge and the others, not their mutual interactions. Or maybe it's considering only the interactions between the fixed charge and the others, not among the others themselves.

Wait, but the problem asks for the minimum energy of the system. So the total potential energy would include all interactions: each of the 12 charges with the fixed charge, and each pair among the 12 charges. But since all the 12 are at the same distance from P, maybe their mutual distances vary, but perhaps we can model the potential energy between each pair as 2e * 2e divided by their distance. But without knowing their exact positions, it's hard to compute. Wait, but maybe the problem is intended to ignore the mutual interactions between the 12 charges. Because if that's the case, the potential energy would just be the sum of each 12 charges interacting with the fixed charge.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only considering the potential energy between the fixed charge and the others, and not the potential energy among the 12. But I'm not sure. Let me re-read the question.

The question says: the 13th charge is fixed at P, and the 12 are constrained to stay at 2m from P. So each of the 12 is at a distance of 2m from the fixed charge. So their mutual distances must be at least 4m apart, but since their arrangement isn't given, maybe in the minimum energy configuration, the mutual potential energy is considered. But wait, if all charges are positive, the mutual potential energy would be positive, and to minimize the total energy, perhaps we need to minimize the sum, which includes both the fixed charge interactions and the mutual interactions.

Wait, but in the case of identical positive charges, the mutual potential energy is all positive, so the system's potential energy would be the sum of all individual pair potentials. So perhaps the minimum total energy is when the mutual potential is
