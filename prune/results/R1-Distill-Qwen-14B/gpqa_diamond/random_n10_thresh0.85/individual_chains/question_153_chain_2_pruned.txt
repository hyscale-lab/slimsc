Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem in front of me. It's about the Michael addition reaction. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through step by step.

The question has three parts, labeled (A), (B), and (C), each involving a Michael addition. I need to figure out the reactants and products for each and match them with the options given.

Let's start by recalling what the Michael addition is. The Michael reaction is a 1,4-addition (conjugate addition) of a nucleophile to an alpha-beta unsaturated carbonyl compound. The nucleophile, usually acting as a base, attacks the beta carbon, forming an enolate intermediate, which then protonates.

So, each part is a Michael addition. Let's tackle each one.

**Reaction (A): dimethyl malonate + methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate + (NaOEt, EtOH) â†’ (A)**

First, I need to identify the nucleophile and the Michael acceptor here.

Dimethyl malonate, I think, is a good nucleophile in the Michael reaction. Its structure is CH2(CO2Me)2. It's a diester, and it can act as the nucleophilic component.

Methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate. Let me draw its structure. The acrylate part is CH2=CHCO2Me, but substituted. Wait, 3-(p-tolyl)acrylate would be CH2=C(p-tolyl)CO2Me. Wait, no, wait. Let me think again. Acrylate is CH2=CHCOO-. So, 3-(p-tolyl)acrylate would be CH2-C(=O)-CO2Me but with a substituent at the 3 position. Wait, no, wait. Maybe the structure is CH2=CH-CO-O-Me, but with a p-tolyl group on the CH2. Wait, no. The formula is methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate. So, the acrylate is CH2=CHCOO-Me, but the 3 position is where the p-tolyl is attached. Wait, that can't be right. Because the acrylate group is CH2=CHCOO-. So, the 3 position would be the CH2, which is the first carbon of the double bond. Wait, maybe the structure is CH2-C(=O)CO2Me but the CH2 is substituted with p-tolyl. Hmm, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Alternatively, perhaps it's (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate, which would be (E)-CH2-CH(p-tolyl)COO-Me? No, wait, acrylate is CH2=CHCOO-. So, if it's 3-(p-tolyl), perhaps it's CH2-C(p-tolyl)=CHCOO-Me? No, that's not correct because acrylate is a three-carbon chain with the double bond between C1 and C2. So the structure is CH2=CH-CO-O-Me. But the substituent is at the 3-position, which is the COO-Me group. Hmm, that doesn't make sense. Maybe I'm wrong. Alternatively, perhaps the structure is (E)-methyl 3-(p-tolyl)acrylate, which would be CH2=C(p-tolyl)COO-Me. Oh wait, that makes more sense. So, the double bond is between carbons 1 and 2, and carbon 2 has the p-tolyl group.

So, methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate is CH2=C(p-tolyl)COOCH3. But wait, that doesn't have three carbons. Oh, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Let me think again. The formula for acrylate is CH2=CHCOO-. So, 3-(p-tolyl)acrylate would have the p-tolyl group on carbon 3, which is the carbonyl carbon. No, that can
