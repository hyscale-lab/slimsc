Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again and try to understand what's being asked.

The question says that there are two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than Star_2, and its mass is also 1.5 times bigger. The astronomers looked at the wavelengths where each star appears brightest and found they're the same. They also measured their radial velocities as 0 and 700 km/s for Star_1 and Star_2, respectively. The task is to find out by what factor Star_1's luminosity is greater than Star_2's, assuming they radiate as blackbodies.

Hmm, okay. So I remember that the luminosity of a star is related to its radius and temperature. The formula for luminosity as a blackbody is L = 4πR²σT⁴, where R is radius, T is temperature, σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant.

Wait, but the problem says both stars appear brightest at the same wavelength. Oh, right! The peak wavelength of a blackbody's emission is given by Wien's Law: λ_max = b / T, where b is Wien's displacement constant. So if the wavelengths are the same, their temperatures must be the same. Because if λ_max is the same, then T is the same. Oh wait, because rearranging Wien's Law, T = b / λ_max. So if λ_max is the same for both, then T is the same for both stars. So T1 = T2.

So luminosity L is proportional to R² T⁴. Since T is the same for both stars, L is proportional to R².

Wait, but the radius of Star_1 is 1.5 times that of Star_2. So R1 = 1.5 R2.

So L1/L2 = (R1/R2)² * (T1/T2)^4. Since T1 = T2, the T term is 1. So L1/L2 = (1.5)^2 = 2.25.

Wait, but that's if the temperatures are the same. But wait, wait a second. Is that the case here? Because the problem says that the stars are moving at different velocities, but that might affect the observed wavelength due to Doppler shift. Oh, right! Because when a star is moving, it can cause a red
