Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics question about matrices and their properties. Hmm, let me think through this step by step. I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, but I'll try to work it out.

The question provides four matrices: W, X, Y, Z. And there are four options, A to D, each making a statement about these matrices. I need to figure out which statement is correct.

First, let me recall some quantum mechanics concepts. I remember that in quantum mechanics, observables are represented by Hermitian matrices because their eigenvalues (which correspond to possible measurement outcomes) are real. Also, the evolution operator, which is part of the time evolution in quantum systems, is unitary. Unitary matrices have the property that their inverse is equal to their conjugate transpose, so UU† = I.

Another key point is that the exponential of a matrix, like e^X, is related to unitary operators when X is Hermitian. Wait, no, actually, e^X is unitary if X is skew-Hermitian because then (e^X)† = e^{-X}, which makes it unitary. But that's only if X is skew-Hermitian (satisfies X† = -X).

So, let's look at the options one by one.

Option A: There exists a vector to which if one multiplies e^X, the norm of the vector changes.

Hmm. The norm would change if e^X isn't unitary. Because, if U is unitary, then Uv has the same norm as v. So if e^X is unitary, then the norm doesn't change. So for option A to be true, e^X must not be unitary. So I need to check whether X is a skew-Hermitian matrix.

Wait, what's X? Let me write it down. X is:

Row 1: i, -1, 2i
Row 2: 1, 0, 1
Row 3: 2i, -1, -i

So to check if X is skew-Hermitian, I need to see if X† = -X. X† is the conjugate transpose of X.

Let me compute X†. First, transpose the rows and columns, then take the complex conjugate of each element.

Original X:

Row 1: i, -1, 2i
Row 2: 1, 0, 1
Row 3: 2i, -1, -i

Transpose (swap rows and columns):

Column 1 becomes row 1: i, 1, 2i
Column 2 becomes row 2: -1, 0, -1
Column 3 becomes row 3: 2i, 1, -i

Now, take the complex conjugate of each element:

Row 1: -i, 1, -2i
Row 2: 1, 0, 1
Row 3: -2i, -1, i

Now, let's compare this to -X. Let's compute -X:

Original X:

Row 1: i
