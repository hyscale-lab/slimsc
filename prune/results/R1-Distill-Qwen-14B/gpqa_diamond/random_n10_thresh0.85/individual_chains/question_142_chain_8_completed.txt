Okay, so I've got this question about quantum states and density matrices. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through.

The question gives a density matrix ρ, which is (1/2)(|0><0| + |1><1|). I remember that density matrices are used to describe the state of a quantum system, especially when it's mixed, meaning it's in a statistical mixture of pure states.

Wait, what's the structure of a density matrix for a qubit? Oh right, a qubit is a two-level system, so the density matrix is a 2x2 matrix. The general form is ρ = [[a, b], [c, d]], where a, b, c, d are elements. But for this specific ρ, let's compute it.

So, |0><0| is a matrix with 1 in the top-left corner and 0 elsewhere. Similarly, |1><1| has 1 in the bottom-right. Adding them gives a matrix [[1,0],[0,1]], which is the identity matrix. Then we multiply by 1/2, so ρ becomes [[1/2, 0], [0, 1/2]]. 

Density matrices have properties: they must be Hermitian, positive semi-definite, and have a trace of 1. This ρ satisfies all that because it's diagonal with real entries adding to 1.

Now, the question is about the geometrical position in the qubits space. I'm a bit confused about what that refers to. Oh, wait, maybe it's about the Bloch sphere representation. The Bloch sphere is a way to represent qubit states. For a pure state |ψ>, it's a point on the sphere with coordinates (x,y,z), and for a mixed state, it's the expectation values.

Right, for a density matrix, the expectation values of the Pauli matrices can be used to find the Bloch vector. The formula is r = (⟨X⟩, ⟨Y⟩, ⟨Z⟩), where X, Y, Z are the Pauli matrices.

So, let's compute ⟨X⟩, ⟨Y⟩, and ⟨Z⟩. The expectation value is Tr(ρ M), where M is the Pauli matrix.

First, Pauli X is [[0,1],[1,0]]. So, ρ multiplied by X is:

ρX = (1/2)[[0,1],[1,0]] * [[1,0],[0,1]] = same as X because X is the same as |0><1| + |1><0|, and ρ is (|0><0| + |1><1|)/2. Wait, no, actually, when you compute Tr(ρ X), which is (1/2) Tr( (|0><0| + |1><1| ) X ).

Wait, because Tr(A B) is the sum of a_ii * b_ii, but maybe it's easier to compute it as Tr(ρ X).

Let me compute each term:

ρ X = (1/2) (|0><0| + |1><1|) X

Each |i><i| multiplied by X. Let's compute each term.

|0><0| X is |0><0| * X. How does X act on |0>? X|0> = |1>, so |0><0| X |0> = |0><0|1> = 0. Similarly, |0><0| X |1> = |0><0|1> = 0. Wait, maybe a better approach is to compute ρ X and then take the trace.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to note that for the Pauli matrices, the expectation value <X> is given by (ρ_{0,1} + ρ_{1,0}) ) because X has 1s off-diagonal. But in our case, ρ is diagonal. So ρ_{0,1} is 0 and ρ_{1,0} is 0. So <X> is 0.

Similarly, for Pauli Y: the expectation value is <Y> = (ρ_{0,1} - ρ_{1,0}) * i. But again, since ρ is diagonal, both terms are zero. So <Y> is 0.

What about <Z>? Pauli Z is [[1,0],[0,-1]]. So Tr(ρ Z) would be ( (1/2)(1)(1) ) + ( (1/2)(1)(-1) ) ? Wait no, actually, Tr(ρ Z) is (1/2)(1 * 1) + (1/2)(1 * (-1)) )? No, wait.

Wait, the trace is the sum of the diagonal elements. So Z is [[1,0],[0,-1]], so ρ Z would be (1/2)[[1*1, 0],[0, (-1)*1]]. Then the trace is 1/2 * (1 + (-1)) = 0.

Wait, no, perhaps I should directly compute Tr(ρ Z). Since ρ is diagonal, multiplying by Z (diagonal as well) would just be element-wise. So ρ Z is (1/2) (1*1, 0; 0, 1*(-1) ), so the diagonal elements are 1/2 and -1/2. Tr is (1/2 + (-1/2)) = 0.

So all three expectation values are zero. Therefore, the Bloch vector r would be (0, 0, 0). Which is option C.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused. Is this correct? Because this density matrix ρ is a completely mixed state. For a qubit, the completely mixed state is I/2. Its Bloch vector should be at the origin because there's no preferred direction, so it's the maximally uncertain state.

Yes, so the position is (0,0,0), which is option C.


The given density matrix is 

\[
\rho = \frac{1}{2} \left( \left|0\right\rangle \left\langle 0\right| + \left|1\right\rangle \left\langle 1\right| \right).
\]

This represents a completely mixed state for a qubit. To determine its geometrical position in the qubit space, we use the Bloch sphere representation. The Bloch vector \( \mathbf{r} = (\langle X \rangle, \langle Y \rangle, \langle Z \rangle) \) is derived from the expectation values of the Pauli matrices \( X, Y, Z \), where \( \langle M \rangle = \text{Tr}(\rho M) \).

1. **Expectation value of \( X \):**  
   The Pauli \( X \)-matrix is \( X = \begin{bmatrix} 0 & 1 \\ 1 & 0 \end{bmatrix} \). Since \( \rho \) is diagonal, the off-diagonal elements of \( \rho X \) are zero. Thus, \( \langle X \rangle = \text{Tr}(\rho X) = 0 \).

2. **Expectation value of \( Y \):**  
   The Pauli \( Y \)-matrix is \( Y = \begin{bmatrix} 0 & -i \\ i & 0 \end{bmatrix} \). Similar to \( X \), the off-diagonal elements of \( \rho Y \) are zero because \( \rho \) is diagonal. Thus, \( \langle Y \rangle = \text{Tr}(\rho Y) = 0 \).

3. **Expectation value of \( Z \):**  
   The Pauli \( Z \)-matrix is \( Z = \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 \\ 0 & -1 \end{bmatrix} \). The diagonal elements of \( \rho Z \) are \( \frac{1}{2}(1) \) and \( \frac{1}{2}(-1) \). The trace of \( \rho Z \) is \( \frac{1}{2}(1) + \frac{1}{2}(-1) = 0 \). Thus, \( \langle Z \rangle = 0 \).

Since all three expectation values are zero, the Bloch vector is \( \mathbf{r} = (0, 0, 0) \). This corresponds to the completely mixed state, which is at the origin of the Bloch sphere.

**Answer: C**
