Okay, I'm trying to solve this astronomy problem about exoplanets detected using the radial velocity (RV) method. Let me think through it step by step.

So, the setup is that there are two stars with the same mass as the Sun, and each has a planet with a mass similar to Neptune. Both planets are in circular orbits. The question is about the orbital periods of the two planets based on the RV measurements.

From what I remember, the RV method detects planets by measuring the Doppler shift of the star's spectral lines. The star moves back and forth due to the planet's gravity, causing a shift in the wavelength of the spectral lines. The size of this shift depends on the mass of the planet, the orbital period, and the distance between the star and the planet.

The formula I think I need here is the one that relates the semi-amplitude of the radial velocity (K) to the orbital period (P). Wait, the semi-amplitude K is given by the formula:

K = (v * sin i) = ( (G * (M_p) ) / ( (M_* + M_p)^(1/3) ) ) * (1 / (P)^(1/3)) )^(-1) ?

Wait, maybe I should write down the correct formula. I think the semi-amplitude K is given by the formula:

K = ( (G * M_p * sin i) ) / ( (M_* + M_p)^(1/3) * (1 - e²)^(1/2) ) ) * ( (1) / (P * (1) )^(1/3) ) )

But since the orbits are circular, e is zero, so (1 - e²)^(1/2) is 1. Also, since M_p is much smaller than M_*, M_* + M_p ≈ M_*, so that part becomes M_*^(1/3).

Wait, the exact formula for K is:

K = [ (G * M_p * sin i) / ( (M_* + M_p)^(2/3) * (1 - e²)^(1/2) ) ) ] * ( (1) / ( (P)^2 * (1 + M_p/M_*) ) )^(1/3) )

Hmm, perhaps I'm getting a bit confused. Maybe I should look for a simplified version when M_p << M_*, which is probably the case here since Neptune's mass is way smaller than the Sun's.

So, under that approximation, the formula simplifies. Let me think. The radial velocity semi-amplitude K can be approximated as:

K ≈ ( (G * M_p) / (M_*^2) )^(1/3) * (1 / P)^(1/3) * (1 / (1 + M_p/M_* ) ) )

Wait, perhaps another approach. I remember that the RV semi-amplitude K is proportional to ( (M_p sin i) / (M_* ) )^(1/3) ) * (1 / (P) )^(1/3) ) ... but I'm not exactly sure. Maybe I should think in terms of Kepler's third law.

Wait, Kepler's third law relates the orbital period to the semi-major axis and the masses. The formula is P² = (4π²/G(M_* + M_p)) ) * a³.

Since M_p is much smaller than M_*, we can approximate P² ≈ (4π²/(G M_* )) a³.

But how does that connect to the radial velocity method?

The radial velocity method depends on the star's velocity, which is related to the planet's orbit. The velocity of the star (v) is given by v = (2π a_*) / P, where a_* is the star's orbit radius. Since a_* is much smaller than a_planet (because M_* >> M_p), we can say that a_* = (M_p/(M_* + M_p)) ) * a_planet ≈ (M_p / M_*) ) a_planet.

But I'm not sure if that's helping. Let me think about the relationship between the RV semi-amplitude (K) and the orbital period.

I think the formula for K is:

K = (v_*) = ( (2π G) / (c P) )^(1/3) ) * ( M_p sin i ) / ( (M_* + M_p)^(2/3) ) )

Since M_p << M_*, this simplifies to:

K ≈ ( (2π G) / (c P) )^(1/3) ) * ( M_p sin i ) / ( M_*^(2/3) ) )

But in this problem, sin i is probably close to 1 because the RV method is most effective when the planet's orbit is edge-on (i=90 degrees), so sin i is 1.

But wait, the exact formula for K that I found elsewhere is:

K = [ (G * M_p * sin i) / ( (M_* + M_p)^(1/3) ) ] * [ (1) / ( (1 + M_p / M_*) )^(1/3) ) ] * (1 / ( (P * (1 - e²) )^(1/2) ) )

But since e is zero (circular orbits), and M_p << M_*, this simplifies to approximately:

K ≈ ( (G * M_p) / (M_*^2) )^(1/3) * (1 / P )^(1/3)

Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of the proportionality between K and 1/P^(1/3). Because both planets have similar masses (Neptune-like), and the stars have the same mass, the ratio of K1 to K2 would be (P2/P1)^(1/3).

Wait, because K is proportional to (1/P)^(1/3), then K ∝ 1/(P^(1/3)).

So, if K1 is the RV semi-amplitude for planet 1 and K2 for planet 2, then:

K1/K2 = (P2 / P1)^(1/3)

Wait, wait, no. Because K is inversely proportional to P^(1/3). Because K = (something) * (1/P)^(1/3). So K1 = C * (1/P1)^(1/3), K2 = C * (1/P2)^(1/3). Therefore, K1/K2 = (P2/P1)^(1/3).

Wait, let's say that K1 is 5 mA and K2 is 7 mA. So K1=5, K2=7.

So K1
