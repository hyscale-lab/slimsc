Okay, so I've got this physics question here, and I'm trying to figure it out. The question is about which physical theory doesn't require regularization at high energies. The options are A) Superstring Theory, B) Quantum Chromodynamics, C) Quantum Electrodynamics, and D) Classical Electrodynamics.

Hmm, I remember that regularization is a technique used in quantum field theories to deal with divergencesâ€”like infinities that pop up in calculations. These infinities can cause problems, so regularization helps to make the math manageable by introducing a cutoff or some other method to handle the divergences.

Wait, so which theories are quantum and which are classical? Classical Electrodynamics is the D option. Oh right, because that's the Maxwell's equations stuff, which doesn't involve quantum mechanics. So it's a classical theory. The others (A, B, C) are quantum theories.

Now, in quantum field theories, you often run into issues with divergent integrals when calculating things like loop diagrams. Regularization is needed to make sense of these calculations. So for QED, QCD, and superstring theory, they probably require regularization.

But wait, I'm a bit fuzzy on superstring theory. I think string theory is a candidate for a theory of everything, trying to unify quantum mechanics with general relativity. But does it require regularization? From what I remember, string theory doesn't have the same kinds of divergences that QFT does because it's a different approach. Or does it? Maybe because it's a theory that incorporates gravity natively, perhaps it doesn't need regularization in the same way. Or maybe it does; I'm not too sure.

Quantum Electrodynamics (QED) definitely requires regularization. Because when you compute loops in QED, like the electron self-energy or photon vacuum polarization, you get divergent integrals. So you have to regularize them, perhaps using a cutoff, dimensional regularization, or other methods. So option C, QED, needs regularization.

Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) is the theory of the strong interaction. It's a non-abelian gauge theory, similar to QED but with SU(3) symmetry. It also has issues with divergences, especially in loop calculations. So regularization is used here as well. So option B also requires it.

Classical Electrodynamics is the D option. Since it's a classical theory, it doesn't involve the same divergences that quantum theories do. Wait, but Maxwell's equations themselves
