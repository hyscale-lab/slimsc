Okay, let's try to tackle this chemistry problem step by step. I'm a bit new to this, so I'll take it slow.

The question is about a substance X reacting with liquid Y. From the description, the reaction is violent and releases gas W. The gas has a molecule with the same number of neutrons and protons. Hmm, same number of neutrons and protons... that sounds like a molecule where each atom has that property. Wait, which elements have equal protons and neutrons? Well, for example, hydrogen has 1 proton and 1 neutron (if it's deuterium), but that's only for some isotopes. Or maybe it's something else. Oh, wait, helium has 2 protons and 2 neutrons. So He is a possibility. But gas W is released, and helium is a gas. That might fit.

So W is He? Let me think. If gas W is helium, then when X and Y react, they produce He. But wait, helium's molecule is monoatomic, right? So each He atom is a molecule. So the molecule has 2 neutrons and 2 protons. That matches the description.

The reaction forms a precipitate G, which when heated releases B. B's melting point is near 277 K. Wait, 277 K is about 4 degrees Celsius. What substances have a melting point near that? Maybe something like ammonium chloride? Or maybe it's a metal that's close to that. Wait, another thought: perhaps it's sodium bicarbonate? No, its melting point is higher. Alternatively, maybe it's something like ice, but ice melts at 273 K, which is 0 degrees Celsius. Oh, wait, 277 is a bit higher, like about 4 degrees. Maybe B is sodium chloride? No, that's way higher. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe B is a different substance. Wait, maybe B is ammonium chloride? I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe B is something like potassium nitrate? No, that's way higher. Alternatively, perhaps B is some other compound. Alternatively, maybe B is a metal, but I'm not sure. Let me think about this later.

Next part: The product of the reaction of a certain keto acid with substance X contains 2 atoms of oxygen. Hmm. A keto acid is an acid with a ketone group. So examples include things like acetoacetic acid or something similar. When it reacts with substance X, the product has 2 oxygen atoms. Wait, perhaps the reaction is with a strong base or something that deprotonates the keto acid.
