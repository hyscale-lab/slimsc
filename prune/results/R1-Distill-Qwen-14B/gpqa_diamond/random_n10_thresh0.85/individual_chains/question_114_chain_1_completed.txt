Hmm, okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me read it again carefully.

The question is about selecting the correct reagents for two reactions. Let's break it down step by step.

First reaction: butan-2-one reacts with NaCN and Reagent A to produce 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. The second reaction involves 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile reacting with Reagent B (and water) to form 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid. The options give possible combinations for A and B, and I need to choose the correct pair.

Okay, starting with the first reaction. Butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO, which is a ketone. When it reacts with NaCN, I remember that nitriles can be formed from ketones through a nucleophilic substitution. Wait, but wait, ketones don't typically undergo nucleophilic substitution under basic conditions. Oh wait, maybe it's an example of a substitution where the carbonyl oxygen is replaced by a cyano group. I think that's the case where the ketone is treated with a cyanide ion (CN-) under certain conditions.

Wait, but how does that substitution happen? I recall that for such reactions, you might need a strong acid. Maybe the cyanide acts as a nucleophile in an acid-catalyzed environment. So, the ketone is protonated to make the carbonyl a better leaving group. Let me think: in the presence of an acid, the carbonyl oxygen becomes protonated, making it a better leaving group. Then, the CN- can attack the carbonyl carbon, pushing the oxygen out as water. So that would form the nitrile.

The product here is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Wait, that's a bit confusing. Let me think about the structure. Butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO, which upon substitution by CN would become (CH3)2C(CN)OH? Wait, no, substitution would replace O with CN. Wait, but the product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. So the structure should be (CH3)2C(OH)CN? Wait, that doesn't seem right. Wait, but butanenitrile is CH2CH2CH2CN, but here it's 2-hydroxy-2-methyl, so maybe it's (CH3)2C(OH)CH2CN? No, wait, but the product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Let me write it as:

Butanenitrile is CH2CH2CH2CN. 2-hydroxy-2-methyl would be on the second carbon. So the structure would be (CH3)2C(OH)CH2CN? No, wait, but butanenitrile is four carbons, with the nitrile on C1. So 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile would be:

CH2-C( (CH3)(OH) )-CH2-CN? No, that doesn't seem right. Wait, maybe I'm not getting the structure correctly. Alternatively, perhaps it's (CH3)2CHON-CN? Not sure, but perhaps I'm overcomplicating.

But the key point is the reaction: ketone + NaCN with some conditions gives a nitrile and an alcohol. Oh wait, wait, no, substitution would replace O with CN. So the product would be (CH3)2C-C≡N, but wait that would be a ketone substitution. Wait, but butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO, when it reacts with NaCN and H3O+ maybe, the O is replaced by CN. So the product would be (CH3)2C(CN), but wait, that's not considering the hydroxyl group. Oh wait, perhaps it's more about a substitution where the oxygen is replaced by CN, but then where does the hydroxyl come from?

Wait, perhaps I'm mixing up reactions. Another possibility: maybe it's an example of a ketone reacting with a cyanide in a different way. Alternatively, perhaps it's a case of the formation of a cyanohydrin. Oh wait! Yes, that rings a bell. A cyanohydrin is formed when a ketone reacts with cyanide in the presence of an acid. The mechanism involves the protonation of the carbonyl oxygen, making it a better leaving group, then the attack by the cyanide ion, leading to the formation of a new carbon-carbon bond.

So the general reaction is ketone + HCN (or NaCN in acidic conditions) → cyanohydrin. The product is a secondary alcohol with a nitrile group attached. So, the product would have an -OH and a -CN on the same carbon.

So for butan-2-one, the product would be 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile, which matches the given product. So Reagent A must be providing the acidic conditions to catalyze this reaction. So A is probably H3O+ (like acid).

Looking at the options, options A and B have A as H3O+. So the first part points to either A or B.

Now, moving to the second reaction. The starting material is 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile. Wait, that's quite a mouthful. Let me parse that. The structure would be a four-carbon chain with a hydroxyl group on C2, a nitrile group on C2, and a 4-benzylphenyl group attached to C2. So the compound might look like:

Ph-C(=O) might be part of it, but wait, I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps it's structured as follows: the main chain is butanenitrile, so four carbons, with the nitrile on C1. But in this case, the nitrile is on C2. Wait, no, butanenitrile is CH2CH2CH2CN with nitrile on C4, but wait, butane has four carbons, so butanenitrile would be CH2CH2CH2CH2CN? No, wait, but butanenitrile is CH2CH2CH2CN. Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused.

In any case, the starting material is 2-hydroxybutanenitrile derivative with a substituent. The product is 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid. So the nitrile group (-CN) has been converted into a carboxylic acid (-COOH).

So reaction is -CN → -COOH. How does that happen?

I remember that nitriles can be hydrolyzed to carboxylic acids under certain conditions. The typical reagents for this are either strong acid (like H2SO4, H2O, heat) or strong base (like KMnO4 under acidic conditions). Alternatively, using a strong acid with H2O and heat.

Wait, but the reagent B is given as H2O, so perhaps it's a hydrolysis reaction. The reagent B is either HCl or CH3COOH.

So, for the conversion of nitrile to carboxylic acid, you can use H3O+ (acid) and heat. Alternatively, using a strong acid like H2SO4 and water.

Wait, but the reagent B is either HCl (as in option A and C) or acetic acid (option B and D).

Wait, I think the usual conditions for nitrile hydrolysis to carboxylic acid involve either strong acid and heat or strong base and then acid workup. For example, in acidic conditions, H2SO4 and water, heat.

But in the presence of H2O and B, which is either HCl or CH3COOH.

Wait, looking at the options, option A has B=HCl, option B has B=CH3COOH, and so on.

So, considering that, the second reaction is the hydrolysis of the nitrile group (-CN) to a carboxylic acid (-COOH). How is this achieved?

The conversion of nitrile to carboxylic acid can be done via hydrolysis. Two main pathways: acid-catalyzed or base-catalyzed.

In acid conditions, H2SO4 is often used as the catalyst, perhaps with heat. Alternatively, using HCl as the acid. But in this case, the reagent is B, which is either HCl or CH3COOH.

Wait, but the reaction is written as: compound + B (H2O) → product. So it's likely an acid-catalyzed hydrolysis. So, using HCl in water as the reagent B would make sense.

Alternatively, if B is HCl, then under these conditions, the nitrile would hydrolyze to a carboxylic acid.

Wait, but wait. Another thought: sometimes nitriles are hydrolyzed using a strong acid like HCl under reflux. Alternatively, in the presence of a peroxide, but that's for ketones.

Wait, another approach: hydrolysis of nitriles to carboxylic acids can be done using H3O+ (like H2SO4) and heat. Alternatively, using AgCN in NH3, but that's for different reactions.

Wait, but another possible pathway is the Stephen reduction, but that's for converting nitriles to amines. No, that's not it.

Alternatively, maybe the reaction is a hydrolysis using HCl as the acid. So in the presence of HCl and water, the nitrile would first hydrolyze to an amide, and then further to a carboxylic acid.

Wait, but the product is a carboxylic acid, so the reaction must involve complete hydrolysis of the nitrile group.

So, if Reagent B is HCl, then in H2O and HCl, would that cause the nitrile to hydrolyze to the acid?

Alternatively, perhaps it's a two-step process. First, the nitrile converts to an amide, then to a carboxylic acid. But I'm not entirely sure.

Wait, but I think that in acidic conditions, the nitrile would first protonate, then undergo attack by water, leading to the formation of an intermediate which eventually becomes the carboxylic acid.

So, to perform this, the acid would be HCl or H3O+.

Looking back at the options, for the second part (B), options A and C have B as HCl and others as CH3COOH.

So if B is HCl, then the conditions are acidic, which would facilitate the hydrolysis.

So putting it together, for the first reaction, Reagent A is H3O+ (from options A and B), and for the second Reagent B is HCl (from option A and C).

So, looking at the options:

Option A: A=H3O+, B=HCl → both reactions would proceed with acid. That seems plausible.

Option B: A=H3O+, B=CH3COOH → HCl is a stronger acid than acetic acid, but would HCl work better for the second reaction?

Wait, but the second reaction is hydrolysis of nitrile to acid. So, the strength of the acid may influence the reaction. HCl is a strong acid, which would provide the necessary conditions for the hydrolysis.

But wait, perhaps the second reaction is using a milder acid like acetic acid. Alternatively, I'm not sure if acetic acid would be sufficient for nitrile hydrolysis. Maybe a stronger acid is needed.

Another point to consider: in the first reaction, the reagent A is H3O+ (acid), which is correct for the cyanohydrin formation. Then, for the second reaction, using HCl as the acid, which is a strong acid, would facilitate the hydrolysis.

So, option A is A=H3O+ and B=HCl.

Wait, but I think I might have made a mistake earlier. Let me think again.

Wait, the second reaction is 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile reacting with B (H2O) to give the acid.

So, the reaction is nitrile → carboxylic acid. So, the reagent B is either HCl (a strong acid) or CH3COOH (a weak acid).

Which acid would be more suitable for this hydrolysis? I think that for nitrile hydrolysis, especially under acidic conditions, HCl is commonly used. For example, when nitriles are treated with HCl and water, they hydrolyze to carboxylic acids.

So, if B is HCl, that makes sense. So option A (A=H3O+, B=HCl) would be correct.

But wait, looking at the options again:

Option A: A is H3O+ and B is HCl

Option C: A is NaHSO3 and B is HCl. Why would NaHSO3 be used?

Wait, perhaps I should reevaluate the first reaction. Is the first reaction definitely using H3O+?

Wait, the first reaction is butanone + NaCN + A → product. I thought that A is H3O+ because it's the acid catalyst for the cyanohydrin formation. But another possibility is that A is NaHSO3, which is a source of H+ and SO3^2-.

Wait, but in the first reaction, the product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile, which is the cyanohydrin. So the reaction requires acid. NaHSO3 is a source of H+ (since HSO3^- is a weak acid; in solution, it can donate a proton). So NaHSO3 could act as an acid catalyst, similar to H3O+.

So, if Reagent A is NaHSO3, then the reaction would proceed. So in that case, for the first reaction, Reagent A could be either H3O+ or NaHSO3.

Wait, but I thought that the cyanohydrin formation requires an acid catalyst. So both H3O+ and NaHSO3 (which is a weaker acid) could serve as catalysts. But which is more likely?

I think H3O+ is a stronger acid. NaHSO3 might not be as effective, but perhaps it's possible.

So, considering that, if option C has A=NaHSO3 and B=HCl, that might also work.

But then, looking at the second reaction again, with B=HCl, that would still be correct for the acid hydrolysis.

Wait, but why would the first reaction use NaHSO3? Let me think about the conditions for the formation of a cyanohydrin. The cyanide ion (CN^-) is a nucleophile, and the ketone is protonated in acidic conditions to make the carbonyl more electrophilic.

So, the acid could be H3O+ (proton source), or another acid like H2SO4. NaHSO3 is sodium bisulfite, which is a source of H+ and bisulfite ions. So perhaps it can also act as an acid catalyst.

But wait, I'm not sure. Maybe the first reaction uses H3O+ and the second uses HCl (option A), but I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps I should think about the possible options. Let's see what each option provides.

Option D: A=NaHSO3, B=CH3COOH.

If B is CH3COOH, then the second reaction is under weak acid conditions. Would that be sufficient to hydrolyze the nitrile to a carboxylic acid?

I think that nitrile hydrolysis to carboxylic acid typically requires strong acid conditions. So, using a weak acid like acetic acid (CH3COOH) may not be strong enough to drive the reaction to completion. So B would need to be a strong acid, like HCl.

That leaves options A and C as possibilities for the second reaction.

But what about the first reaction?

If in the first reaction, Reagent A is H3O+, that would fit the scenario for the cyanohydrin formation.

So, the possible options are A (A=H3O+, B=HCl) or C (A=NaHSO3, B=HCl).

Now, which one is correct?

I think that in the first reaction, the presence of an acid is needed. NaHSO3 (sodium bisulfite) is a weaker acid than H3O+, but it can still donate a proton. So, perhaps both A and C are possible.

Wait, but let's think about the other part. The product in the first reaction is a cyanohydrin, which is a secondary alcohol with a nitrile group. How does the reaction proceed?

The mechanism involves the protonation of the ketone oxygen, making it a better leaving group. Then, the CN- attacks the carbonyl carbon, forming a new bond and pushing the oxygen out as H2O. So, H+ is crucial.

NaHSO3 in water would provide H+ ions, so it can act as the acid catalyst. So, perhaps Reagent A can be NaHSO3 as well.

So, if A is NaHSO3, then that's a possibility. Then, for the second reaction, Reagent B is HCl.

So, looking at options, option C has A=NaHSO3 and B=HCl.

But wait, why would the first reaction use NaHSO3? I'm a bit confused. I think H3O+ is more commonly used for such reactions, but perhaps both could work.

So, how do I decide between options A and C?

Wait, the second reaction is in the presence of H2O and B. If B is HCl, then the reaction is in HCl and water (acidic conditions), which would be suitable for nitrile hydrolysis.

But if B were CH3COOH, would that be sufficient? I'm not sure. Maybe for the nitrile to acid conversion, a strong acid is better, so B=HCl is correct.

So, looking back at the options, option A is A=H3O+, B=HCl, which fits both reactions.

Alternatively, option C is A=NaHSO3, B=HCl.

So, which is correct?

Wait, perhaps I should look for any other clues. The first reaction produces a cyanohydrin, and the second converts the nitrile to a carboxylic acid.

Wait, but the first reaction uses NaCN, which is a source of CN- ions. So, in aqueous solution, perhaps the NaCN is in an acidic environment, which would help in the attack by CN-.

So, if the first reaction uses H3O+ (option A), that's more straightforward.

Alternatively, using NaHSO3 (option C) for the first reaction.

Wait, perhaps the first reaction requires a stronger acid. H3O+ is a stronger acid than NaHSO3. Because H3O+ is a stronger acid (since it's the conjugate acid of water, whereas HSO3^- is the conjugate base of H2SO3, a weaker acid).

So, the stronger acid H3O+ would be better for protonating the ketone.

Hence, option A (A=H3O+, B=HCl) would be suitable.

Wait, but then looking at the options, option A is A=H3O+, B=HCl. So, that would make the first reaction use H3O+ as the acid, which is correct, and the second reaction uses HCl to hydrolyze the nitrile to the acid.

So, the correct option would be A.

Wait, but let me check the other options. Option C is A=NaHSO3, B=HCl. So, if the first reaction uses NaHSO3 as the acid, that's possible, but I'm more confident that the correct reagent for the first reaction is H3O+, making option A correct.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Another approach: the presence of H3O+ in the first reaction and HCl in the second.

So, looking at the options, option A is A=H3O+, B=HCl, which fits.

So, the answer should be option A.


The question involves selecting the correct reagents for two reactions:

1. **First Reaction**: Butan-2-one reacts with NaCN and Reagent A to form 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile.  
   - This is a cyanohydrin formation reaction, where the ketone reacts with cyanide in the presence of an acid catalyst. The acid protonates the carbonyl oxygen, making it a better leaving group, and the cyanide ion attacks the carbonyl carbon.  
   - For this reaction, the acid catalyst (Reagent A) must be present. Both H₃O⁺ and NaHSO₃ can act as acid catalysts, but H₃O⁺ is a stronger acid and more commonly used for such reactions.

2. **Second Reaction**: 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile reacts with Reagent B (in the presence of water) to form 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid.  
   - This is the hydrolysis of a nitrile group (-CN) to a carboxylic acid (-COOH). Nitrile hydrolysis typically requires strong acidic or basic conditions. For acidic hydrolysis, HCl is a suitable reagent as it provides the necessary acidic environment for the reaction to proceed.

### Analysis of Options:
- **Option A**: A = H₃O⁺, B = HCl  
  - H₃O⁺ is a strong acid and ideal for the first reaction (cyanohydrin formation). HCl is a strong acid and suitable for the second reaction (nitrile hydrolysis). This combination is plausible.  

- **Option B**: A = H₃O⁺, B = CH₃COOH  
  - H₃O⁺ is suitable for the first reaction, but CH₃COOH (a weak acid) may not provide sufficient acidic conditions for the hydrolysis of the nitrile group in the second reaction. This combination is less likely.  

- **Option C**: A = NaHSO₃, B = HCl  
  - NaHSO₃ can act as an acid catalyst for the first reaction, but it is a weaker acid compared to H₃O⁺. While it could work, H₃O⁺ is more commonly used. HCl is suitable for the second reaction. This combination is plausible but less favorable than Option A.  

- **Option D**: A = NaHSO₃, B = CH₃COOH  
  - NaHSO₃ is a weaker acid and less suitable for the first reaction. CH₃COOH is a weak acid and insufficient for the second reaction. This combination is unlikely.  

### Conclusion:
The most suitable reagents are A = H₃O⁺ and B = HCl, as they provide the optimal conditions for both reactions.
