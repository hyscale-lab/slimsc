Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Hmm, let me read it again to make sure I understand what's being asked. 

The question is about finding the eigenvector of a quantum mechanical operator P for a muon along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane. The eigenvalue is given as +ħ/2. They provide the components of the operator P in the X, Y, and Z directions as 2x2 matrices multiplied by ħ/2. The task is to find the elements of the normalized eigenvector.

Wait, I remember that in quantum mechanics, observables are represented by Hermitian operators, and their eigenvectors represent the possible states when that observable is measured. The eigenvalues are the possible results of the measurement.

The operator P is given in terms of its components P_x, P_y, and P_z. But since the direction is arbitrary in the x-z plane, I think we're dealing with a spin operator in a direction that's a combination of x and z. So the operator we're considering is P = P_x * n_x + P_y * n_y + P_z * n_z. But wait, n is in the x-z plane, so n_y would be zero. So P simplifies to n_x P_x + n_z P_z. But wait, n is a unit vector, so n_x² + n_z² = 1. Hmm, or wait, actually, n_x and n_z would be cosine and sine or something related to polar angles. Maybe the direction is given by an angle θ in the x-z plane, so n_x = cosθ and n_z = sinθ? Or perhaps n_z is sinθ? Wait, no, because in standard spherical coordinates, θ is the polar angle from the z-axis. So if the direction is in the x-z plane, then φ would be zero or π, so the direction is (n_x, 0, n_z), with n_x² + n_z² =1. So n_x can be cosθ, n_z sinθ, where θ is the angle from the z-axis. Or wait, maybe from the x-axis. Hmm, need to clarify.

Wait, the direction is lying in the x-z plane, so the vector n is (n_x, 0, n_z). Since it's a unit vector, n_x^2 + n_z^2 = 1. So, let's say n_x = cosθ, n_z = sinθ? Or is it the other way around? Well, it depends on how θ is defined. Let's say θ is the angle made with the z-axis. Then n_x would be sinθ * cosφ, but since we're in the x-z plane, φ is 0, so n_x = sinθ. Wait, no, wait. The standard spherical coordinates have θ as the polar angle from the z-axis, and φ as the azimuthal angle in the xy-plane. So, for a vector in the x-z plane, φ is 0 or π. So, the components would be (sinθ * cosφ, 0, cosθ). But in this case, since the direction is in the x-z plane, φ is zero. So n_x = sinθ, n_z = cosθ. Because for φ=0, x = sinθ * 1, z = cosθ. So the direction vector is (sinθ, 0, cosθ). So the operator P would be sinθ * P_x + cosθ * P_z.

Wait, but the question says the direction is arbitrary in x-z, so the operator is a combination of P_x and P_z. So the operator we need is P = n · σ (since spin operators are often proportional to Pauli matrices σ). Alternatively, since each P component is (ħ/2) times the corresponding Pauli matrix, because the Pauli matrices are σ_x, σ_y, σ_z. So, for example, P_x = (ħ/2) σ_x, similarly for P_y and P_z.

So the operator P in the direction n is (n_x P_x + n_z P_z) = (n_x (ħ/2) σ_x ) + (n_z (ħ/2) σ_z ). But since eigenvalue is ħ/2, we can write it as:

P |ψ> = (ħ/2) |ψ>

Wait, no, the operator is P = n · (P_x, P_y, P_z). But since n lies in x-z plane, the y-component is zero. So P = n_x P_x + n_z P_z.

Wait, but each of P_x, P_y, P_z is (ħ/2) times their respective Pauli matrices. So P = (n_x (ħ/2) σ_x) + (n_z (ħ/2) σ_z) ) = (ħ/2)(n_x σ_x + n_z σ_z).

We need to find the eigenvectors of this operator corresponding to eigenvalue +ħ/2. So, the eigenvalue equation is:

P |ψ> = (ħ/2) |ψ>

Which would imply:

(ħ/2)(n_x σ_x + n_z σ_z) |ψ> = (ħ/2) |ψ>

We can divide both sides by ħ/2:

(n_x σ_x + n_z σ_z) |ψ> = |ψ>

So, this simplifies to (n_x σ_x + n_z σ_z) |ψ> = |ψ>

So, the operator in the eigenvalue equation is the matrix (n_x σ_x + n_z σ_z), and we're looking for its eigenvectors with eigenvalue 1.

Let me compute (n_x σ_x + n_z σ_z) matrix. The Pauli matrices are:

σ_x = [[0, 1], [1, 0]]
σ_z = [[1, 0], [0, -1]]

So, n_x σ_x is [[0, n_x], [n_x, 0]], and n_z σ_z is [[n_z, 0], [0, -n_z]]. Adding them together:

[[n_z, n_x], [n_x, -n_z]]

So the matrix is [[n_z, n_x], [n_x, -n_z]]

We need to find the eigenvectors of this matrix where the eigenvalue is 1. So, the equation is:

[[n_z, n_x], [n_x, -n_z]] |v> = |v>

Let me write the matrix as:

[ [n_z, n_x],
  [n_x, -n_z] ]

The eigenvectors are non-zero vectors [a,b] such that (matrix - I) |v> = 0.

So, matrix - I is:

[ [n_z -1, n_x ],
  [n_x, -n_z -1] ]

The determinant of this matrix should be zero because it's singular for non-trivial solutions.

Wait, but we already know the eigenvalues. We're considering the eigenvalue 1. So, to find the eigenvectors, we can solve (matrix - I)|v> = 0.

So, the equations are:

(n_z - 1) a + n_x b = 0

n_x a + (-n_z -1) b = 0

Let me write these equations:

Equation 1: (n_z -1) a + n_x b = 0
Equation 2: n_x a + (-n_z -1) b = 0

We can solve for a and b in terms of each other.

From equation 1:

a = [ -n_x b ] / (n_z - 1 )

Similarly, equation 2:

a = [ (n_z + 1) b ] / (n_x )

Wait, but substitution might be tricky. Let's consider that (n_z)^2 + (n_x)^2 = 1 because n is a unit vector. So, n_z^2 + n_x^2 =1.

Let me see if the two equations are consistent. Let me substitute a from equation 1 into equation 2.

From equation 1: a = (-n_x b)/(n_z -1 )

Substitute into equation 2:

n_x * [ (-n_x b)/(n_z -1 ) ] + (-n_z -1) b = 0

Multiply through:

[ -n_x^2 b / (n_z -1) ) ] + (-n_z -1) b = 0

Factor out b:

b [ (-n_x^2)/(n_z -1) + (-n_z -1) ] = 0

Since we're looking for non-trivial solutions (b ≠ 0), the term in the brackets must be zero.

So,

[ (-n_x^2) ]/(n_z -1) ) + (-n_z -1)
