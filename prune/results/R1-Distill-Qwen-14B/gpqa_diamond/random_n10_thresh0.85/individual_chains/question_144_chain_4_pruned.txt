Okay, so I've got this physics problem in front of me, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question is about.

The question is about a meson resonance called X. I remember that mesons are particles made up of a quark and an antiquark. Resonances in particle physics are particles that don't exist long enough to be observed directly and decay very quickly. The question is asking about the mean decay distance of this meson X. 

The given data are: production energy E_X is 8 GeV, mass m_X is 1.2 GeV, and the width Γ_X is 320 MeV. The options are four different distances in meters, all in the order of 10^-15 or 10^-16 meters. Hmm, so this is probably a very small distance, which makes sense because particles with short lifetimes don't travel far before decaying.

I think the mean decay distance depends on the lifetime of the particle and its velocity. The formula I recall is something like c multiplied by the lifetime. But wait, I need to get the lifetime first. Oh right, the width Γ is related to the lifetime τ by the uncertainty principle. The relation is Γ ≈ ħ / τ, so τ ≈ ħ / Γ. But wait, let me get that right. Gamma is the total decay width, and it's related to the mean lifetime by Γ = ħ / τ. So τ = ħ / Γ. 

Wait, but I'm a bit confused about the units here. Gamma is given in MeV, which is an energy unit. ħ has units of GeV·seconds or something like that. I need to make sure the units work out.

So, let's outline the steps I need to take:

1. Calculate the lifetime τ of the meson X using Γ.
2. Find the velocity of the meson, probably using its energy and mass.
3. Multiply the lifetime by the velocity to get the mean decay distance.

Wait, but velocity is important because the particle is moving, so the distance it travels is v multiplied by the lifetime. So the formula for the mean decay length L is L = v * τ. 

Alternatively, another approach: the mean decay distance can also be found using the formula L = (E * c * τ) / m. Hmm, I'm not sure. Maybe I should double-check the correct expression.

Alternatively, since the particle is moving relativistically, the lifetime observed in the lab frame is dilated. So the proper lifetime τ is given by τ = ħ / Γ. Then, the observed lifetime is γτ, where γ is the Lorentz factor, which is E/(m c²). So the total lifetime in the lab frame is τ' = γ τ = (E/(m c²)) * (ħ / Γ). Then, the decay distance is v * τ', but since v is approximately c for high-energy particles, it simplifies to L ≈ c * τ' = (E/(m c²)) * (ħ c) / Γ.

Wait, let's see. Let me write the expressions step by step.

First, the lifetime in the rest frame of the particle is τ = ħ / Γ. But for a moving particle, the lifetime observed in the lab frame is longer by a factor of gamma, which is gamma = E / (m c²). Because E in the lab frame is the total energy, and E = gamma m c². So gamma = E / (m c²). 

So the lab frame lifetime is τ_lab = gamma * tau_rest = (E/(m c²)) * (ħ / Γ).

Then, the decay distance is L = v * τ_lab. Now, for a relativistic particle, v ≈ c, so we can approximate L ≈ c * τ_lab.

Putting it all together: L ≈ c * (E/(m c²)) * (ħ / Γ).

Simplify this: L = (E * c * ħ) / (m c² Γ) ) = (E * ħ) / (m c Γ).

Wait, let me compute that. Let me make sure about the units as well. 

So let's plug in the values. But first, I need to make sure all units are consistent. 

Given:
E_X = 8 GeV
m_X = 1.2 GeV (but we'll have to convert this into kg or something)
Γ_X = 320 MeV.

Hmm, let's convert all to GeV for consistency. 

So Γ_X is 0.320 GeV.

Wait, but Planck's constant ħ is often expressed in units of GeV·s. Wait, what's ħ in GeV·seconds? Let me recall: 1 GeV = 1.60218e-10 J. So ħ is approximately 6.582 x 10^-25 GeV·s. Because ħ is about 1.0545718e-34 J·s, so in GeV·s, it's (1.0545718e-34 J·s) / (1.60218e-10 J/GeV) ) ≈ 6.582 x 10^-25 GeV·s.

So ħ ≈ 6.582e-25 GeV·s.

Now, let's compute L:

L = (E * ħ) / (m c Γ )

Wait, no. As per the earlier expression, L ≈ (E * ħ) / (m c Γ) ?

Wait, wait, no. Let me recheck the earlier expression.

We had:

L ≈ (E * c * ħ) / ( m c² Γ )

Wait, no, let me go back.

The formula derived:

L ≈ c * (E/(m c²)) * (ħ / Γ)

Which becomes L = (E * c * ħ) / (m c² Γ )

Simplify numerator and denominator: 

E is in GeV, m is in GeV/c².

Wait, the units for m should be in GeV/c², because m c² is in GeV.

So, let's write the formula again:

L = ( E (GeV) * ħ (GeV s) * c (m/s) ) / ( m (GeV/c²) * c^2 (m²/s²) * Γ (GeV) )

Wait, perhaps better to compute each factor numerically with correct unit conversions.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to use natural units, where c=1 and ħ=1, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps I should use all SI units.

Let me try that. 

First, let's convert each quantity to SI units.

E_X = 8 GeV = 8 * 1.60218e-10 J = 1.281744e-9 J.

m_X =1.2 GeV/c². To convert to kg, we know that 1 GeV/c² is approximately 1.7827e-27 kg. So:

m_X = 1.2 * 1.7827e-27 kg ≈ 2.13924e-27 kg.

Γ_X = 0.320 GeV. To convert to Joules: 0.320 * 1.60218e-10 J = 5.126976e-11 J.

Now, Planck's constant ħ is 1.0545718e-34 J·s.

c is 3e8 m/s.

So, putting it all into the formula:

L = (E * ħ) / (m c Γ )

Wait, no, I think we had:

L ≈ (E * ħ) / (m c Γ )

Wait, wait, let me recheck the formula.

Earlier, I have:

L ≈ c * (E/(m c²)) * (ħ / Γ )

So,

L = c * (E/(m c²)) * (ħ / Γ )

Expressed in SI units, this becomes:

L = [m/s] * [ (J) / (kg (m²/s²)) ) ] * [ (J s) / (J) ]

Wait, let me compute the units. Let's see:

E is in J, m is kg, c is m/s.

E/(m c²) has units: (J) / (kg (m²/s²)).

J is kg m²/s², so:

( kg m²/s² ) / ( kg (m²/s²) ) ) → 1/s.

So E/(m c²) is unitless? Wait, no, because c is in m/s. So E/(m c^2) is (kg m²/s²) / ( kg (m^2/s^2) )) → 1, so unitless. So gamma is E/(m c²), which is unitless.

Then, ħ has units J s. Γ is in J.

So (ħ / Γ) has units (J s) / J = s.

Multiply by c (m/s) and gamma (unitless):

So L has units (m/s) * (unitless) * (s) → m.

So the formula works.

So,

L = c * (E/(m c²)) * ( ħ / Γ )

Now plug in the numbers.

Compute gamma: E/(m c²)

E is 1.281744e-9 J.

m is 2.13924e-27 kg.

c is 3e8 m/s.

So,

gamma = E/(m c²) = (1.281744e-9 J) / ( 2.13924e-27 kg * (3e8 m/s)^2 )

Wait, let's compute denominator: m c^2.

Wait, but E is given as 8 GeV, which is the total energy. So gamma is E/(m c^2) = (8 GeV) / (1.2 GeV/c² * c²) ) = 8 / 1.2 = 6.666... So gamma is 6.666... so that's 20/3 ≈6.6667.

Wait, that's a much easier way. Because E = gamma m c².

So gamma = E/(m c²) = (8 GeV) / (1.2 GeV) ) = 8 / 1.2 = 6.666... So gamma is approximately 6.6667.

That's a big simplification. So gamma = 8 / 1.2 = 6.6667.

So now, the formula simplifies to:

L = c * gamma * (ħ / Γ )

Because tau is (ħ / Γ ), and L = v tau. For high-energy particles, v ≈ c, so L ≈ c * tau = c * (gamma tau_0 ), where tau_0 is the proper lifetime.

Wait, no, earlier I thought tau_lab = gamma tau_rest, which is correct.

So, L = v * tau_lab. But tau_lab = gamma tau_rest, and for relativistic particles, v ≈ c, so L ≈ c * gamma * (ħ / Γ )

So,

L = c * gamma * (ħ / Γ )

Now, compute gamma = 6.6667.

Now, ħ is 1.0545718e-34 J·s.

Γ is 0.320 GeV, which is 0.320e9 eV. Wait, but earlier I converted Γ to J as 5.126976e-11 J.

So,

ħ / Γ = (1.0545718e-34 J·s) / (5.126976e-11 J) ) = (1.0545718e-34 ) / (5.126976e-11 ) ≈ 2.057e-24 seconds.

Wait, let's compute that:

1.0545718e-34 / 5.126976e-11 = 

1.0545718 / 5.126976 ≈ 0.2057.

Then, 1e-34 / 1e-11 = 1e-23. So 0.2057e-23 is 2.057e-24 seconds.

So tau_rest = ħ / Γ ≈ 2.057e-24 s.

Tau_lab = gamma * tau_rest = 6.6667 * 2.057e-24 s ≈ 1.371e-23 s.

Then, L = c * tau_lab ≈ (3e8 m/s) * 1.371e-23 s = 4.113e-15 meters.

Wait, that's approximately 4.113e-15 meters. Looking at the options:

Option B is 4.0655e-15 m.

Option D is 4.0655e-16 m.

Hmm, close to 4.1e-15. But my calculation is a bit off. Let me check if I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, let me re-calculate ħ / Γ in seconds.

Gamma in J: 0.320 GeV = 0.320 * 1.60218e-10 J = 5.126976e-11 J.

ħ = 1.0545718e-34 J·s.

So, ħ / Γ = 1.0545718e-34 / 5.126976e-11 = 1.0545718 /5.126976 * 1e-23 → approx 0.2057 *1e-23 → 2.057e-24 seconds.

Gamma is 6.6667.

Tau_lab = 6.6667 * 2.057e-24 = let's compute that.

6.6667 * 2.057e-24 = (6 * 2.057e-24) + (0.6667*2.057e-24) = approx 12.34e-24 + 1.371e-24 = 13.71e-24 → 1.371e-23 seconds.

Then, c is 3e8 m/s.

So, L = 3e8 * 1.371e-23 = 4.113e-15 m.

Hmm, but the closest option is option B, 4.0655e-15, which is approximately 4.065e-15 m.

Wait, maybe my calculation of gamma is wrong. Because earlier, I thought gamma is E/(m c²), which is 8 GeV / 1.2 GeV = 6.6667. But wait, m is given as 1.2 GeV/c². So E/(m c²) is (8 GeV) / (1.2 GeV) ) = 6.6667. So that part is correct.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of ħ / Γ. Let me compute that more precisely.

Gamma is 0.320 GeV = 320 MeV. Let me see:

But in the formula, I used ħ in J·s and Γ in J.

Alternatively, perhaps using the natural unit system would make it easier.

Wait, maybe there's another approach using natural units where c=1 and ħ=1. Let me think.

In natural units, ħ = 1, c=1, so energies are in GeV, masses are in GeV/c², which in natural units is GeV.

The width Γ is in GeV.

The mean lifetime tau is ħ / Γ, but in natural units, since ħ=1, it's 1/Γ in GeV^-1. To convert GeV^-1 to seconds, since ħ = 6.582e-25 GeV·s, so 1 GeV^-1 = 6.582e-25 s.

So, tau = ħ / Γ = 6.582e-25 s / (Γ in GeV).

So, tau = 6.582e-25 s / (0.320 GeV) ≈ 2.056875e-24 s.

Then, the lab frame lifetime is gamma * tau. Gamma is 8 / 1.2 = 6.6667.

So, tau_lab =6.6667 * 2.056875e-24 ≈ 1.371e-23 s.

Then, the distance L is c * tau_lab → 3e8 m/s *1.371e-23 s → 4.113e-15 m.

Which rounds to about 4.11e-15 m. Looking at the options, the closest is B)4.0655e-15 m.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in gamma. Hmm, let me double-check the gamma calculation.

E =8 GeV, m=1.2 GeV/c². So, gamma = E/(m c²) in natural units. Since E is in GeV, m c² is in GeV. So gamma=8/1.2=6.6666667.

So that's correct.

Wait, perhaps I should be more precise with the numbers.

Let me compute ħ / Γ more accurately.

Gamma is 0.320 GeV.

So, 6.582e-25 s / 0.320 = 2.056875e-24 s.

Gamma is 6.666666..., so 2.056875e-24 *6.6666667 = ?

Let me compute 2.056875e-24 *6.6
