Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question is about.

The problem says: We have an electron state |alpha> which is proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2 - i)|down>. |up> and |down> are the eigenstates of the z-projection of the spin operator. We need to find the probabilities of measuring the particle in each eigenstate of another operator whose matrix is A with elements Aij = ħ/2 if i≠j and 0 otherwise. Also, find the average value of that operator.

The options are A, B, C, D with different probabilities and average values.

Hmm. Okay, let me break this down.

First, I think I need to normalize the state |alpha>. Because it's only proportional to that expression. So the given state isn't necessarily normalized yet. Let me compute the normalization factor.

The state is |alpha> = (1+i)|up> + (2 -i)|down>. The normalization condition is <alpha|alpha> = 1. So let's compute that.

<alpha|alpha> = |1+i|^2 + |2 -i|^2.

Because |a|^2 = a * a*, right? So for the first term, |1+i|² = (1)^2 + (1)^2 = 2. Wait, no, wait—actually, (1+i)(1-i) = 1 +1 = 2. So yes, that's 2.

The second term: |2 -i|² = (2)^2 + (1)^2 = 4 + 1 =5. So total is 2 +5=7. So the norm is sqrt(7). So we should write |alpha> as [ (1+i)/sqrt(7) ] |up> + [ (2 -i)/sqrt(7) ] |down>.

Wait, no—because the original state is proportional, so the normalized state is (1+i)|up> + (2 -i)|down>, divided by sqrt(7). So the coefficients are (1+i)/sqrt(7) and (2 -i)/sqrt(7).

So, okay, the state is properly normalized now.

Next, the operator whose matrix is given. Let me think about what the matrix looks like. Since it's a 2x2 matrix (because |up> and |down> are two eigenstates), and Aij is ħ/2 if i≠j, and zero otherwise.

So A is a 2x2 matrix with 0 on the diagonal and ħ/2 on the off-diagonal. So it's:

[ 0       ħ/2 ]
[ ħ/2     0 ]

Wait, that's the matrix. So what does this operator represent? Hmm. I think this is similar to the Pauli X matrix scaled by ħ/2. Because the Pauli X matrix is [[0,1],[1,0]]. So in this case, the operator A would be (ħ/2) * sigma_x. Because sigma_x has the same structure.

So, this operator A is the spin-x operator. Because the spin-x operator is Sx = ħ/2 sigma_x, which matches A.

Wait, let me double-check. The spin matrices for Pauli are Sx = (ħ/2) [[0,1],[1,0]], Sy = (ħ/2)[[0,-i],[i,0]], Sz = (ħ/2)[[1,0],[0,-1]]. So yes, the given matrix A is exactly Sx.

So the eigenstates of A are the eigenstates of Sx. So our task is to find the probabilities of measuring the eigenvalues of Sx when the system is in state |alpha>.

The eigenstates of Sx are |+x> and |-x>, which are superpositions of |up> and |down>.

But wait, maybe it's easier to express |alpha> in terms of the eigenbasis of A (i.e., |+x> and |-x>), and then the probabilities are the squares of the coefficients.

Alternatively, since A is Sx, perhaps we can compute the expectation value and the probabilities using the state |alpha>.

Wait, but the question is about the probability of measuring each eigenstate of A. So each eigenstate has its own eigenvalue. So we need to find the probabilities P(+x) and P(-x), and the average value <A>.

Hmm. So first, let's find the eigenstates of A (i.e., Sx). The eigenstates of Sx are |+x> = (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2) and |-x> = (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2). Wait, no—actually, more accurately, the eigenstates are |+x> = (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2) and |-x> = (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2), but I should verify that.

Wait, for Sx, the eigenstates are indeed (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2) for eigenvalue +ħ/2, and (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2) for eigenvalue -ħ/2.

So, let's express |alpha> in terms of |+x> and |-x>.

Alternatively, I can compute the expansion coefficients by taking the inner product of |alpha> with each of these eigenstates.

So our state |alpha> is in the |up>, |down> basis, and the eigenstates of A are in this same basis, so let's proceed.

Let me write |alpha> as:

|alpha> = (1+i)/sqrt(7) |up> + (2 -i)/sqrt(7) |down>.

The eigenstates |+x> and |-x> are in the same basis.

Compute < +x | alpha > and < -x | alpha >.

Let me compute < +x | alpha > first.

< +x | alpha > = [ <+x|up> (1+i)/sqrt(7) ) + <+x|down> (2 -i)/sqrt(7) ]

But <+x | up> is 1/sqrt(2), and <+x | down> is 1/sqrt(2).

So this becomes [ (1/sqrt(2))(1+i) + (1/sqrt(2))(2 -i) ] / sqrt(7) ?

Wait, no. Let me think again.

Wait, < +x | alpha > = (1/sqrt(2)) (1 + i) + (1/sqrt(2)) (2 - i) ) all divided by sqrt(7), because the coefficients of |up> and |down> in |alpha> are (1+i)/sqrt(7) and (2 -i)/sqrt(7), respectively.

So let's compute (1/sqrt(2)) [ (1+i) + (2 -i) ] / sqrt(7).

Wait, wait, that's the sum inside the brackets. Let me compute the numerator.

(1+i) + (2 -i) = 3 + 0i. So 3.

So < +x | alpha > = (3) / (sqrt(2
