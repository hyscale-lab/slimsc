Okay, so I have this physics problem about light moving through a glass that's itself moving. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's try to think it through.

So the setup: a light beam is going through glass with index of refraction n. The glass is moving at a constant velocity v in the same direction as the beam and towards the observer. The question is asking, what's the speed of light in the glass relative to the lab frame?

Wait, wait. The speed of light in the glass is normally c/n, right? Because when light enters a medium with higher refractive index, its speed decreases. But here, the glass itself is moving. So does that affect the observed speed of the light?

I remember something about the Galilean transformation or maybe the relativistic velocity addition. Oh right, because the glass is moving, there might be a Doppler effect or some kind of velocity addition here.

Wait, but the problem states that the glass is moving in the same direction as the beam. So the beam is going in the same direction as the glass's motion. But the beam is within the glass, which is moving. So what's the lab frame seeing?

Let me think. The light's speed in the glass's frame is c/n. Since the glass is moving at velocity v, we need to find the speed of the light in the lab frame.

Wait, no. Because the light is moving through the glass, which is itself moving. So to get the lab frame speed, we can't just add the speeds directly, because velocities don't add linearly when you're dealing with relative motion, especially at significant fractions of the speed of light. Oh, but the problem says to take c=1, so maybe it's okay to use a simpler approach.

Wait, but in the glass's rest frame, the light is moving at v_light = c/n. The glass is moving at velocity v relative to the lab. So what's the lab's measurement of the light's velocity?

I think it's a case of velocity addition. The lab sees the velocity of the light as the velocity of the glass plus the velocity of the light in the glass's frame. Because both are in the same direction.

Wait, but wait. The velocity addition formula in Galilean relativity is u' = u + v, where u is the velocity in the moving frame and v is the frame's velocity relative to the lab. But I'm not sure if that's applicable here because when we're dealing with light, it's a different case. Because in relativity, the speed of light is always c in any frame.

Wait a minute, that's a key point. According to Einstein's theory, the speed of light in a
