Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let's see what it's about. 

The question has two reactions, and I need to find the suitable reagents A and B from the given options. The reactions are:

1. Butan-2-one + NaCN + A → 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile
2. 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile + B (H2O) → 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid

The options are A, B, C, D, each suggesting what A and B are. Let me break this down.

First, looking at the first reaction. Butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO, which is a ketone. Then it's reacting with NaCN and reagent A to produce 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Hmm, wait, the product is a nitrile and an alcohol group. Oh, right, that sounds like a substitution reaction where the carbonyl oxygen is replaced by a nitrile group and a hydroxyl group. Or maybe it's some kind of addition followed by elimination?

Wait, NaCN is a nucleophile. So perhaps it's a nucleophilic addition to the ketone. Oh, but wait, ketones typically undergo nucleophilic addition, where the nucleophile attacks the carbonyl carbon. But in this case, the product has a hydroxyl group and a nitrile. So maybe the mechanism is the formation of a cyanohydrin.

Cyanohydrin formation! Right. That's when a ketone reacts with a nitrile (like from NaCN) in the presence of an acid catalyst to form a cyanohydrin. The cyanohydrin has the structure where the nitrile is added along with a hydroxyl group on the adjacent carbon.

So for the first reaction, the reagent A is likely an acid catalyst because the cyanohydrin formation typically uses an acid like H3O+ (sulfuric acid, H2SO4, or something similar) to protonate the carbonyl oxygen, making it more electrophilic for the CN- to attack.

So for reaction 1, A is H3O+.

Looking at the options, options A and B have A as H3O+, while C and D have A as NaHSO3. So I can eliminate options C and D for the first part.

Now, the second reaction. The starting material is 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile, which is reacting with B in H2O to form 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid. So the nitrile group (-CN) is being converted into a carboxylic acid (-COOH).

How does that happen? Nitriles can be oxidized. The typical reagents for oxidizing nitriles to carboxylic acids are strong oxidizing agents. But in the presence of water, which is the solvent here, I think about what reagent would facilitate this.

Wait, I remember that the hydrolysis of nitriles can be done under acidic or basic conditions. But for oxidation to a carboxylic acid, it usually requires a strong oxidizing agent like KMnO4 or K2Cr2O7 under acidic conditions.

Wait, the starting material is a nitrile with adjacent hydroxyl groups. So maybe it's more about hydrolysis of the nitrile group.

Wait, the product is a carboxylic acid, so the nitrile (-CN) becomes -COOH. So the nitrile is being hydrolyzed to a carboxylic acid. The typical conditions for this are either strong acid or strong base.

In acidic conditions, H3O+ (like H2SO4, HCl) would protonate the nitrile, making it more electrophilic, then water attacks, leading to a ketone intermediate, which then gets oxidized further. Wait, or maybe it's a two-step process: hydrolysis to the amide, then further oxidation.

Alternatively, maybe it's using a strong acid like HCl (B is HCl) as the reagent. So for the second reaction, B is HCl.

Wait, looking at the options, option A says B is HCl, option B says B is CH3COOH. So if B is HCl, that would fit with the acidic hydrolysis of nitriles to carboxylic acids.

Wait, but let me think again. The reaction in the second step is a nitrile turning into a carboxylic acid. Another possibility is the use of a peracid or another oxidizing agent, but I think in this case, since it's in water, it's more likely to be an acid-catalyzed hydrolysis.

So for the second reaction, reagent B is HCl.

So putting it together, for reaction 1, A is H3O+ (so options A or B). For reaction 2, B is HCl (so option A or C? Wait, no, the options are A) A=H3O+, B=HCl; B) A=H3O+, B=CH3COOH; etc.

So with reaction 1 A=H3O+ and reaction 2 B= HCl, that would be option A.

Wait, but wait. Let me think again about the first reaction. The cyanohydrin formation. The reagent is H3O+ as a catalyst, so that's correct.

But another thing to consider: are there any other possibilities? Could the first reaction be something else? Like a nucleophilic substitution? No, because butanone is a ketone, so the reaction is an addition, not substitution.

So, I think the correct reagents are A = H3O+ and B = HCl, which is option A.


The first reaction involves the formation of a cyanohydrin from butan-2-one and NaCN. Cyanohydrin formation typically requires an acid catalyst to protonate the carbonyl oxygen, making it more electrophilic for the nucleophilic attack by CN⁻. Among the options, reagent A is identified as H₃O⁺, which satisfies this requirement. This eliminates options C and D, as they suggest A = NaHSO₃, which is not suitable for this reaction.

The second reaction involves the conversion of a nitrile group (-CN) into a carboxylic acid (-COOH). This requires a strong acid to facilitate the hydrolysis of the nitrile group. Among the options, reagent B is identified as HCl, which provides the necessary acidic conditions for this transformation. This eliminates option B, as it suggests B = CH₃COOH, which is not strong enough for this reaction.

Thus, the correct reagents are A = H₃O⁺ and B = HCl, corresponding to option A.

Answer: A
