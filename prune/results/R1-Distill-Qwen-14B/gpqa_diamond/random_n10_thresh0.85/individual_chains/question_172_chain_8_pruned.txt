Okay, so I have this question about stars and their effective temperatures. Hmm, let's see what it's asking. Oh right, it's about iron atoms in the photosphere of two stars. The iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to star_2. And the energy difference between the levels is given as 1.38e-23 J. Oh wait, I remember that in stars, when they're in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE), the distribution of atoms in energy levels follows the Boltzmann distribution.

So the Boltzmann equation relates the population of different energy levels. The formula is something like N2/N1 = exp( -(E2 - E1)/(k*T) ), right? Because higher energy levels are less populated if the energy difference is positive. 

In this case, the energy difference is given as approximately 1.38e-23 J. Let me denote the energy difference as ΔE = E2 - E1. Wait, no, wait. Wait a second. The problem says that star_1's iron atoms are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to star_2. I think that means the population is higher. So if star_1 has more atoms in a higher energy level, that would imply that star_1 is hotter because higher temperatures allow more excitation.

Wait, but I'm getting ahead of myself. Let's clarify: the question says that in star_1, the iron atoms are twice as excited in a specific energy level. So perhaps the number of atoms in a certain excited state is twice as much in star_1 compared to star_2. So let's say the ratio is N1/N2 = 2, where N1 is the number in star_1 and N2 in star_2 for that energy level.

Wait, no. Wait, the problem says "iron atoms in the photosphere of star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level when compared to the iron atoms in star_2." So perhaps the excitation is higher, meaning the population of a higher energy state in star_1 is twice that in star_2. Or perhaps it's the other way around? Wait, no, because if a higher energy level is more populated, that suggests higher temperature. Because thermal energy is higher.

Wait, but I'm getting confused. Let me think. The Boltzmann factor is N2/N1 = exp( -ΔE/(k T) ), where N2 is the number in the higher energy state, N1 the lower. So if star_1 has twice as many in a certain state, say N_a for star_1 and N_b for star_2. Wait, but which energy level are we talking about? Hmm, the question says the energy difference is ΔE = 1.38e-23 J. So maybe we're looking at two adjacent energy levels, E1 and E2 = E1 + ΔE. 

Wait, but the exact setup is a bit unclear. Let me think again. The problem states that in star_1, the iron atoms are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to star_2. So perhaps the population for a particular level is N1 in star_1 and N2 in star_2, and N1 = 2 * N2. 

So the ratio N1/N2 = 2. 

But according to the Boltzmann factor, the ratio of populations is determined by the temperatures. So for each star, the population ratio would be governed by their respective temperatures. Let me model this.

Let's say for star
