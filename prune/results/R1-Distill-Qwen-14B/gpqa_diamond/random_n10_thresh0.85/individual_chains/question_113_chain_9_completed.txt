--- Full Content ---
Okay, so I'm trying to figure out the chemical formula of this unknown compound based on the given spectroscopic data. Let's break it down step by step. 

First, the FTIR data: There's a very broad peak around 3000 cm⁻¹. Broad peaks in IR usually indicate O-H stretching, like in alcohols or maybe carboxylic acids. Also, the broadness might suggest hydrogen bonding, which is common in alcohols or maybe something like a ketone with a strong O-H? Wait, no, ketones don't have O-H. So probably either an alcohol or a carboxylic acid. 

Then there are strong absorption peaks at 1700 and 1650 cm⁻¹. The 1700 is a strong peak, which typically corresponds to a carbonyl group (C=O). The 1650 might be another carbonyl, but maybe in a conjugated system, like an ester or a conjugated ketone. Or perhaps an aromatic ring with some conjugation. Wait, I remember that conjugated carbonyl groups might have their absorption around lower wavenumbers. Alternatively, the 1650 could be a C=C stretching (but that's usually around 1600-1650, so that's possible too). Hmm, but the 1700 is a strong peak, so likely a carbonyl group.

Next, the 1H NMR data shows peaks corresponding to vinyl hydrogens. Vinyl hydrogens are the ones attached to a double bond, like in alkenes. So that suggests the compound has an alkene group. 

Looking at the mass spectrum, there's a fragment peak at m/z =45. I need to think about what fragments give m/z 45. Common fragments for 45 are like a methyl group attached to something. Wait, 45 is the molecular weight of (CH3)O. Or maybe CH3CHO (which is 44? Wait, no. Let me compute: CH3CHO is C2H4O, which is 44 (12*2 +4 +16=44). 45 would be something else. Hmm. Maybe it's a fragment like CH3CO+, which is 43? Wait, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Alternatively, 45 could be the tropylium ion, but that's for benzene derivatives. Alternatively, maybe it's a CH3COO- group, but that would be the molecular ion for acetic acid, which is 60. Hmm. Wait, another thought: the molecular formula possibilities are given, so maybe the molecular ion is present. Let me check the molecular formulas.

The options are:
A) C6H12O2
B) C6H10O
C) C6H10O2
D) C6H12O

So, each molecular formula has a different molecular weight. Let's compute them.

C6H12O2: (6*12) +12 + (2*16) =72+12+32=116
C6H10O:72 +10 +16=98
C6H10O2:72 +10 +32=114
C6H12O:72 +12 +16=100

So, the molecular ions would be at m/z 116, 98, 114, and 100. But the mass spec shows a fragment at 45, not the molecular ion. So, 45 must be a fragment of the compound. Let's think about possible fragments.

If the molecular formula is C6H12O2, for example, the molecular weight is 116. So, a fragment at 45 would be a part of it. Let's see: 45 could be a CH3COO- group as a fragment? Wait, CH3COO- is 45? Let's compute: C2H3O2^− would have a molecular weight of (2*12)+(3*1)+(2*16)=24+3+32=59. No, that's not right. Hmm.

Wait, another approach: 45 is a common fragment for (CH3)2CO, which is acetone. But acetone's molecular weight is 58. So if the parent compound is bigger, maybe a fragment cleaves off to give a 45 mass. Alternatively, perhaps it's a CH2CH2O group? Not sure. 

Alternatively, 45 could be a CH2CH2O fragment, but I'm not certain. Another possibility is that the fragment is a methyl group attached to an oxygen, like OCH2CH3 (ethoxy) but wait, the mass of OCH2CH3 is 15 (O) + 15 (CH2CH3) =30, which isn't 45. Hmm.

Wait, maybe the fragment is a ketene (like O=C=O?), but that's not right. Alternatively, perhaps it's a methyl group attached to a carbonyl, like CH3CO+. Let me calculate the mass of CH3CO+. CH3CO+ is C2H3O. So (2*12)+(3*1)+(16) =24+3+16=43. Close to 45, but not exactly. So perhaps that's not it.

Another possibility: Maybe the fragment is a methyl group plus something else. Wait, 45 is 9 more than 36 (which is CH2=CH2O, maybe not). Alternatively, perhaps it's a keto group fragment. Let me think about the molecular formula again.

Wait, the 1H NMR has vinyl hydrogens, so the structure must have a double bond. So maybe a conjugated carbonyl, like an enone (a conjugated ketone and alkene), such as something like cyclohexenone. Alternatively, an ester with a double bond nearby. 

Looking back at the IR: The peak at 1700 is a strong carbonyl. If it's an ester, the carbonyl is usually around 1740-1700, depending on substitution. If it's a ketone, around 1700. The peak at 1650 could be either another carbonyl (maybe an ester or another ketone) or maybe a conjugated double bond (C=C). But since the NMR shows vinyl hydrogens, it's more likely a C=C. But the IR at 1650 might correspond to a conjugated carbonyl, like in an alpha, beta-unsaturated ketone or ester. 

So maybe the structure is an alpha,beta-unsaturated ester or ketone. Let's say it's an ester. 

Now, let's think about the molecular formula and the IR. For example, if it's an ester, the formula would have an O in the ester group (O in COO). Looking at the options, A and C have two oxygens. So, perhaps the compound is an ester. 

Looking at the NMR: vinyl hydrogens. So perhaps a structure like CH2=CHCOOR, but that's just an example. 

Putting it together, the possible molecular formulas are A) C6H12O2 and C) C6H10O2. Let's see which fits the mass spec. 

If the formula is C6H10O2 (option C), the molecular weight is 114. If a fragment breaks off, say a (CH3)2CO group (which is 58), then the remaining would be C3H7O2 (which is 3*12 +7 +16*2 =36+7+32=75). Not matching 45. Alternatively, perhaps a cleavage occurs to produce a smaller fragment. 

Wait, another approach: the molecular formula of the unknown is one of these four. If the mass spec shows a peak at 45, which is exactly half the molecular weight of 90 (45 x 2 =90). But wait, the possible molecular weights are 116, 98, 114, and 100. 45 is about half of 90, which isn't one of the options. Hmm, maybe not. 

Alternatively, perhaps the fragment is part of the molecule. Let me think about the molecular formulas again. 

If the molecular formula is C6H10O2 (option C), then the possible fragments could be like C3H6O2 and C3H4O. Wait, not sure. Alternatively, if the molecule is an ester, perhaps the ester group breaks off as a smaller molecule. For example, in ethyl acetate, if it breaks into the ethyl group and the acetate, but I'm not certain.

Wait, another point: the IR shows a broad peak at 3000 cm⁻¹. If that's an O-H stretch (like in an alcohol or carboxylic acid), then the compound has an -OH group. But wait, if it's an ester, it wouldn't have an -OH, unless it's a hemiacetal or something, which is less likely. Alternatively, perhaps it's an acid. Wait, but if it's a carboxylic acid, the O-H would be very broad and strong around 2500-3300 cm⁻¹. But the peak here is at 3000. Hmm, maybe it's an alcohol. 

If it's an alcohol, then it would have an -OH group. But in that case, the carbonyl peak at 1700 would need to be explained. Maybe a ketone and an alcohol. But then, the formula would have two oxygen atoms, so that would match options A and C. 

Wait, let me think about the degrees of unsaturation. The degrees of unsaturation can help figure out the structure. 

Degrees of Unsaturation (DoU) formula: DoU = (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. Assuming no halogens or nitrogens, DoU = (2C +2 - H)/2.

Looking at the options:

Option A: C6H12O2 → C=6, H=12, O=2. DoU = (2*6 +2 -12)/2 = (14-12)/2=1. So one DoU, which could be a ring or a double bond.

But wait, the NMR shows vinyl hydrogens, which implies a double bond. So DoU must be at least one. 

Option B: C6H10O → DoU = (14-10)/2 =2. So two degrees: maybe a ring and a double bond, or two double bonds, or a ring and a carbonyl. 

Option C: C6H10O2 → DoU (2*6+2 -10)/2 = (14-10)/2=2. So two degrees, which could be a ring and a double bond, or a ring and a carbonyl, or two double bonds.

Option D: C6H12O → DoU=(14-12)/2=1. So one DoU, which could be a ring or a double bond. But since we know there's a vinyl (double bond), the DoU must be at least one. So for options A and D, DoU is 1, which might not account for the double bond plus another. Hmm, wait, because the vinyl implies a double bond, which is one DoU, so if DoU is 1, that's all accounted for. But wait, in that case, the carbonyl would add another DoU. So that's conflicting. 

Wait, that's a good point. Each double bond or ring is one DoU. A carbonyl is a double bond (C=O), which is another DoU. So if the compound has a carbonyl group and a double bond, that's two DoU. So the formula must have DoU ≥2.

Looking again:

Option A: DoU 1 → cannot have both a carbonyl and a double bond. So this is out.

Option B: DoU 2 → possible. So maybe a carbonyl and a double bond.

Option C: DoU 2 → same as option B.

Option D: DoU 1 → same as A, which is out.

So the possible options are B and C. 

But wait, the FTIR has a peak at 1700 and 1650. If the compound has a carbonyl (1700) and a conjugated double bond (which would lower the carbonyl's wavenumber a bit), the 1650 might be from the conjugated double bond. Alternatively, 1650 could be another carbonyl group. But having two carbonyls (like in an ester or an acid) would fit a formula with two oxygens. So let's see.

If the formula is C6H10O (option B), DoU is 2. That would allow for a double bond and a carbonyl group. But the IR shows two strong carbonyl peaks. Hmm, maybe not. Alternatively, maybe the 1650 is from a conjugated C=C. Let me think: the IR for a C=C is around 1600-1680 cm⁻¹, but if it's conjugated with a carbonyl, it can be lower, maybe around 1650. So perhaps the 1700 is a carbonyl and the 1650 is the conjugated double bond. So that fits.

But then, the formula would have to have both a double bond and a carbonyl, making DoU 2. So option B (DoU 2) would be possible if the formula is C6H10O. But wait, the IR shows a broad peak, which suggests an O-H group. So if the formula is C6H10O, that's one oxygen. So the structure could be a ketone with an alcohol group? Hmm, but a ketone and an alcohol would have two oxygen atoms. Oh wait, option B is C6H10O, so only one oxygen. That's conflicting. Because to have both a carbonyl and an O-H group (like an alcohol), you need two oxygens. 

Ah, that's a problem. So option B (C6H10O) has only one oxygen. So if the compound has both a carbonyl (which requires O) and an O-H group (like an alcohol or acid), then the formula would need two oxygens. So that rules out option B. So the possible options are now C and A, but earlier we thought A has DoU 1, which might not fit. Wait, no:

Wait, earlier analysis said that option A (C6H12O2) has DoU 1, which would mean one double bond or ring. But the IR has a carbonyl (DoU 1) and the vinyl (another DoU). So that's a problem because DoU 1 can't account for both. So option A is out. 

So the only remaining option is C: C6H10O2, which has DoU 2. That would accommodate a carbonyl (DoU 1) and a double bond (DoU 1). Also, two oxygen atoms would allow for both the carbonyl and an O-H group, but wait, the FTIR has a broad peak at 3000. If it's an O-H, that would require a hydroxyl group, which in the formula would have an additional O. Wait, C6H10O2 has two O's. If one is in a carbonyl (like an ester or ketone), the other could be in an O-H group (like an alcohol or acid), but wait, a carboxylic acid would require another O. Wait, no, a carboxylic acid is -COOH, which has two O's in the COOH group. So that's a possibility. 

Wait, let me think. If it's a carboxylic acid, then the formula would have two O's (the COOH has two O in the COO part). So the molecular formula would be, for example, C6H10O2. That fits option C. 

But wait, in the IR, a carboxylic acid would show a very broad O-H around 2500-3300. The peak here is at 3000, which is a bit lower than typical for a carboxylic acid, but possible. Also, the carbonyl for a carboxylic acid is around 1700 cm⁻¹, which matches. So that fits. 

Alternatively, it could be an ester with an alcohol group, but that would require more O's, maybe. Or maybe it's an ester and a ketone, but that would complicate things. 

Now, considering the mass spec. The fragment at m/z 45. Let's think about the possible structure. If it's a carboxylic acid, the formula is C6H10O2. The molecular weight is 114. If the molecule breaks in a way that a fragment of 45 is formed. Hmm. Let's think, in a carboxylic acid, perhaps the acid could lose CO2, but that would leave a fragment of 114 -44=70, which isn't 45. Alternatively, maybe it's a cleavage near the COOH group.

Alternatively, suppose the structure is something like CH2CH2COOH, but that's probably not. Wait, maybe it's a cyclic ester, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the fragment is a methyl group attached to something. Wait, 45 is 9 more than 36. Hmm. Another approach: think of the molecular formula of the fragment. If the fragment is C3H7O, then its molecular weight would be (3*12)+(7)+(16)=36+7+16=60. No, not 45. Alternatively, C2H5O: 24 +5 +16=45. Oh! So if the fragment is C2H5O, that's 45. 

So what would break off to give C2H5O? That's a molecule with formula C2H5O. Wait, but the parent molecule is C6H10O2. Let me see: 6 carbons, if 2 are lost as C2H5O, that leaves 4 carbons. So the other part would be C4H5O. Hmm, but I'm not sure if that's feasible. Alternatively, maybe the fragment is a methyl ester group or something. 

Alternatively, maybe the molecular ion breaks into a smaller fragment. For example, if the molecule is something like CH2=CHCOOCH2CH2CH3, but that's a long chain. Alternatively, maybe it's a cyclic ester, like a lactone. So, for example, a five-membered ring, like gamma-lactone. 

Wait, but I'm not making progress on the mass spec part. Maybe I should look for another clue. 

The 1H NMR has vinyl hydrogens. So there's a double bond. Also, the IR shows a strong carbonyl. So perhaps it's an alpha,beta-unsaturated ester. So structure like CH2=CHCOO-R. 

If the formula is C6H10O2, then R would be C3H5. But that's a bit unclear. Alternatively, perhaps it's a cyclic structure.

Wait, another thought. The molecular formula C6H10O2 with a molecular weight of 114. If the molecule breaks into a fragment of 45, what's left is 114-45=69. 69 could be another fragment. Let me see what a fragment of 45 could be. If it's an ethyl group attached to something, like OCH2CH3 (which is 45? Let me compute: O is 16, CH2CH3 is 15 (12+2*1 for CH2, and 1*12 +3*1 for CH3). So 16 +15=31. No, that's 31, not 45. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe it's a ketene (like O=C=O), but that's unlikely. Maybe a methyl group attached to a carbonyl. Wait, CH3COO- is 59, but that's not 45. 

Alternatively, perhaps the fragment is a propyl group. Wait, propanol is 45? Let me compute: C3H7OH. Molecular weight: 3*12 +7 +16 +1=36+7+16+1=60. No, that's 60. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the fragment is a ketone. Like CH3CO+. That would be 43 (12*2 +1*3 +16=24+3+16=43). Close, but not 45. 

Alternatively, maybe the fragment is a methyl group plus something else. Wait, 45 is equal to 44 (CH3CHO) plus 1? Not sure. 

Alternatively, maybe the fragment comes from the loss of a larger part of the molecule. For example, if the molecule is an ester like CH2CH2COOCH2CH2CH3, but I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps the fragment is a cyclopropane ring or something, but I'm not sure.

Hmm. Maybe I should proceed with the other data points and see if option C fits all the clues. Let's see:

- FTIR: broad peak at 3000 cm⁻¹ → O-H group, maybe carboxylic acid.
- Strong peaks at 1700 and 1650 → carbonyl and conjugated C=C, perhaps.
- 1H NMR: vinyl hydrogens → C=C present.
- Mass spec: fragment at 45 → perhaps a C2H5O group.

If the formula is C6H10O2, let's imagine the structure. Maybe it's an alpha,beta-unsaturated carboxylic acid. Structure like CH2=CHCOOH. Wait, that's C3H4O2. But our formula is C6H10O2. So perhaps it's a longer chain, like CH2=CHCOOCH2CH2CH3. Wait, that would be C6H10O2. Let me check: 

CH2=CHCOOCH2CH2CH3 → the formula is:

CH2=CHCOO- has 3 carbons (CH2, CH, COO), and the ester group OCH2CH2CH3 adds 3 more, so 6 in total. 

Hydrogens: each CH2 has 2 H, the CH has 2 H, the COO has no H (as ester), and the OCH2CH2CH3 has 2*2 (from OCH2) + 2*(from CH2CH3). Wait, let me count properly:

CH2=CHCOO-OCH2CH2CH3? No, wait, the ester would be CH2=CHCOOCH2CH2CH3.

So structure:

CH2=CHCOO-O-R where R is CH2CH2CH3?

Wait, the structure is CH2=CHCOOCH2CH2CH3. So the formula would be C3 (from CH2=CHCOO) + C3 (from CH2CH2CH3) = C6. Oxygens: two from the ester group. So formula is C6H10O2. 

Now, the molecular weight is 114. In the mass spec, a fragment of 45 could come from the loss of the ester group. Wait, the ester group is OCOOCH2CH2CH3. Hmm, not sure. Alternatively, the fragment at 45 could be the CH2CH2COO part. Wait, no, CH2CH2COO would be more than 45. 

Alternatively, maybe the methyl group from the ester breaks off. Wait, the ester is CH2CH2CH3-O-CO-CH2=CH2. If the CH2CH2CH3 group breaks off as (CH2CH2CH3)O-? That would have a molecular weight of 45 (15 (CH2CH2CH3) +16 (O) =31? No, 15 is 12+3, but O is 16. So 15+16=31, which is not 45. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe the ester group breaks into two parts. Let me think: if the molecule is CH2=CHCOOCH2CH2CH3, and it breaks between the ester oxygen, then the acetate part (CH2=CHCOO-) would have a molecular weight of 72 (C3H4O2: 3*12=36, 4 H=4, 32 O=32 → 36+4+32=72). The other part (CH2CH2CH3) would weigh 56 (3*12=36, 7 H=7 → 36+7=43, plus O from the ester? No, because the O is part of the acetate. Hmm, not matching. 

Alternatively, perhaps the fragment is the CH2=CHCOO group, which is 72 as above, but that's larger than 45. So that might not fit. 

Wait, another approach: the mass 45 is exactly 45, so what's the empirical formula for 45? Let's see, 45 divided by 12 gives 3.75 carbons. So maybe C3HxOy. Let's find x and y where 12*3 +x +16*y =45. 36 +x +16y=45 → x+16y=9. Possible y=0: x=9 → C3H9, but that's impossible as H can't be more than 2n+2 for a saturated molecule (n=3 → max H=8). y=0, x=9 → not possible. y=1: x=9-16= -7 → no. So y can't be 1. Hmm, maybe O is in a different form. Not sure. 

Alternatively, maybe it's a different combination. Let's think of it as C2HxOy. 24 +x +16y=45 → x+16y=21. y=1 → x=5. So C2H5O. That gives a molecular weight of 45. So a fragment of C2H5O. How would that form? 

Perhaps the ester group breaks in a way that the O is attached to a C2H5 group. For example, if the ester is CH2CH2COOCH2CH2CH3, it could cleave to give CH2CH2O (which would be C2H4O, molecular weight 44), but not 45. Alternatively, maybe a different cleavage. 

Alternatively, perhaps the fragment is an ethylene oxide (C2H4O), which is 44, but the peak is at 45. Hmm. 

I'm getting stuck on the mass spec part. Let's try to think about the other data again. 

The FTIR has a broad peak at 3000, which suggests an O-H group. If the compound is a carboxylic acid, then the formula would have two O's, which fits option C. The IR peaks at 1700 and 1650: the 1700 is the carbonyl (C=O) of the acid, and the 1650 could be the C-H stretching in the -COOH group, but wait, that's not right. Alternatively, the 1650 could be a C=C stretch if the compound has an alkene. 

So putting it all together, the structure is likely an alpha,beta-unsaturated carboxylic acid. So it would have both a double bond and a carbonyl group. The formula would be C6H10O2, which is option C. 

In the NMR, the vinyl hydrogens would appear as a triplet or multiplet around 5-6 ppm. 

In the mass spec, a fragment at 45 could come from the loss of the acid group or another part. Alternatively, perhaps it's a smaller fragment, but without knowing the exact structure, it's hard to say. 

So, given all this, I think the correct answer is option C: C6H10O2.


The unknown compound's chemical formula is determined using the provided spectroscopic data:

1. **FTIR Analysis**:  
   - A broad absorption peak at 3000 cm⁻¹ suggests the presence of an O-H group, likely from a carboxylic acid or alcohol.  
   - Strong peaks at 1700 and 1650 cm⁻¹ indicate a carbonyl group (C=O) and possibly a conjugated double bond (C=C).  

2. **¹H NMR Analysis**:  
   - Peaks corresponding to vinyl hydrogens (hydrogens attached to a double bond) confirm the presence of a C=C bond.  

3. **Mass Spectrometry**:  
   - A fragment peak at m/z = 45 suggests a smaller fragment with a molecular weight of 45. This could correspond to a fragment like C₂H₅O.  

4. **Analysis of Options**:  
   - **Option A (C₆H₁₂O₂)**: Molecular weight = 116, degrees of unsaturation (DoU) = 1. This formula cannot account for both a carbonyl group and a double bond, as it only allows one degree of unsaturation. Thus, this option is ruled out.  
   - **Option B (C₆H₁₀O)**: Molecular weight = 98, DoU = 2. This formula has two degrees of unsaturation, which could accommodate a carbonyl and a double bond. However, it only has one oxygen atom, which is insufficient to explain the broad O-H peak in the IR spectrum. Thus, this option is ruled out.  
   - **Option C (C₆H₁₀O₂)**: Molecular weight = 114, DoU = 2. This formula allows for both a carbonyl group and a double bond. The two oxygen atoms can account for the broad O-H peak (indicative of a carboxylic acid) and the carbonyl group. This option fits all the data.  
   - **Option D (C₆H₁₂O)**: Molecular weight = 100, DoU = 1. Similar to Option A, this formula only allows one degree of unsaturation, which is insufficient to explain the presence of both a carbonyl group and a double bond. Thus, this option is ruled out.  

5. **Conclusion**:  
   The compound is most consistent with **C₆H₁₀O₂** (Option C). The broad O-H peak in the IR spectrum suggests a carboxylic acid group, the 1700 cm⁻¹ peak corresponds to the carbonyl group, and the 1650 cm⁻¹ peak could correspond to a conjugated double bond. The mass spectrometry fragment at m/z = 45 likely corresponds to a smaller fragment, such as C₂H₅O.  

**Answer: C**
