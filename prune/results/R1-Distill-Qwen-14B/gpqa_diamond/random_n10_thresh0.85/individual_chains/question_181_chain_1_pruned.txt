Okay, so I've got this neutrino flux question about the Sun. Let me try to break it down. Hmm, the question says that the pp-III branch suddenly stopped in the Sun's core about 8.5 minutes ago. I remember that 8.5 minutes is roughly the time it takes for light to travel from the Sun's core to Earth, right? So any neutrinos from the Sun would still be reaching us normally, but the pp-III reactions are stopped.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused about the pp branches. So, the proton-proton chain has different branches. The main one is the pp-I branch, which produces helium-4. Then there's the pp-II branch, which I think produces boron and then leads to more reactions. And the pp-III branch is another branch, maybe producing something else. Oh right, the pp-III branch produces Be-7, which then undergoes other reactions. Or wait, no, I'm getting mixed up with the CNO cycle. Oh wait, the CNO cycle has carbon involved, while the pp chain is about protons fusing into helium.

So, the pp-III branch must be part of the proton-proton chain. I think the pp-III branch involves the formation of deuterium (H-2) and then fuses further. Or maybe it's the branch where two protons fuse, but then one emits a positron and becomes a neutron... No, maybe that's not right. Alternatively, pp-III might involve triple-alpha reactions? No, that's the fusion for heavier stars. Wait, maybe I should look up the pp chain branches again. Oh, wait, the pp chain has two main branches. The pp-I is the main one, producing He-4. The pp-II is the branch where a proton captures a helium-3 nucleus to make Be-7, which then captures a proton to form B-8, which decays into Li-7 and a positron. Hmm, but then where does pp-III come in?

Wait, maybe pp-III isn't a separate branch but another part. Alternatively, perhaps pp-III refers to a specific part of the chain, like the formation of deuterium. Oh, right, the pp chain has the first part where two protons fuse into deuterium via the pp-I branch, and another way via pp-II. Or perhaps I'm mixing this up. Alternatively, pp-III might be the process that produces a different isotope, like He-3. No, wait, the main branch (pp-I) produces He-4, while other branches produce He-3.

Wait, I'm getting stuck. Maybe I should think about the neutrinos produced. The question is about the flux of neutrinos in two energy bands. So, when the pp-III branch stops, certain neutrinos are no longer emitted.

Solar neutrinos mainly come from the pp chain and the CNO cycle. The dominant source is the pp chain's pp-I branch, producing He-4. But other processes like the decay of B-8 in the pp-II branch emit neutrinos. Specifically, the B-8 decay emits electron neutrinos (Î½_e). But the pp-III branch, if it's producing something else, might also emit neutrinos.

Wait, let me think. The pp chain: the main process is two protons fusing to deuterium via the pp-I branch, which then fuses with another proton to make helium-3. Then,
