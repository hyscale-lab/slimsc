Okay, so I've got this astronomy question in front of me, and I need to figure it out. Let me read it again to make sure I understand.

The question says that stars are uniformly distributed in the sky. We need to determine how the number of stars per unit range of parallax (plx) changes with plx. The options are A to D, each a different power of 1/plx.

Hmm, I remember that parallax is related to distance. Parallax (in arcseconds) is inversely proportional to distance (in parsecs), right? So the formula is plx = 1/distance, where distance is in parsecs. So a star that's closer has a larger parallax.

But how does this relate to the number of stars in a given range of parallax? I'm a bit fuzzy on this, so let me think.

If stars are uniformly distributed, that means the number density of stars is constant in space. So, the number of stars in a certain volume depends on the size of that volume. But parallax relates to distance, so maybe I should think about how volume changes with distance.

Wait, the question is about the number per unit range of parallax. So, it's like for each small change in parallax (dplx), how many stars are there?

Since plx = 1/d, then d = 1/plx. So as plx increases (meaning the star is closer), d decreases.

Now, if I consider a thin shell at a distance d with thickness dr. The volume of this shell would be 4π d² dr. Because the volume of a spherical shell is surface area (4πd²) multiplied by dr (the thickness).

But wait, since d = 1/plx, then dr = - (1/plx²) dplx. Wait, because d = 1/plx, so dr/dplx = -1/(plx²). So dr is proportional to -dplx / plx². But since plx is positive, and for a thin shell, maybe I can take the absolute value.

So, the volume element dV for a shell at distance d is 4π d² dr. Substitute d = 1/plx and dr as (dplx)/(plx²). Wait, let me think about it:

If plx = 1/d, then d = 1/plx. So, when plx increases by dplx, d decreases by (d * (dplx/plx²)), because differentiating d = 1/plx, we get dd = - (1/plx²) dplx. So, dr is the absolute value, so dr = (d * (dplx/plx²)) )? Wait, maybe I should think about it differently.

Wait, another approach: Let's say we have a range of parallax from plx to plx + dplx. What's the corresponding range of distances? Since plx = 1/d, the distance goes from d = 1/plx to d' = 1/(plx + dplx). The difference in distance is dd = d - d' ≈ (d dplx)/(plx)^2. Because for small dplx, 1/(plx + dplx) ≈ 1/plx - dplx/(plx²). So, dd ≈ d dplx / plx².

Wait, but the volume of a spherical shell is 4πd² dd. So, the number of stars in that shell, assuming uniform distribution, would be n (number density) multiplied by the volume. So N = n * 4π d² dd.

But since d = 1/plx, substituting, we get d² = 1/plx². And dd = d dplx / plx² = (1/plx) dplx / plx² = dplx/(plx^3).

So, substituting into N: N = n * 4π (1/plx²) * (dplx / plx^3) ) = 4 π n (dplx) (1/plx^5) )

Wait no, wait:

Wait, plugging in:

d = 1/plx, so d² = 1/(plx)^2.

dd = d dplx / plx² = (1/plx) * (dplx) / (plx²) ) = dplx / plx^3.

So, Volume (dV) = 4π d² dd = 4 π (1/plx²) * (dplx / plx^3 ) ) = 4 π dplx / plx^5.

So, the number of stars in this volume is N = n * dV = n * (4 π dplx / plx^5 ). So, the number per unit parallax range (dplx) is N / dplx = 4 π n / plx^5.

Wait, but the question is about the number of stars per unit range of plx. So, for each dplx, how many stars are there. That would be N as I wrote.

Wait, no. Let me think again. When plx increases (say, goes from plx to plx + dplx), the corresponding distance goes from d to d' = 1/(plx + dplx) ≈ d - d* (dplx)/(plx)^2. So, the distance shell thickness is dd = d * dplx/(plx)^2. So, the volume of the shell is 4π d² dd = 4π d² (d dplx)/(plx^2).

But since d = 1/plx, substitute:

4π (1/plx)^2 * (1/plx) * dplx / plx² ) = 4 π (1/plx^5) dplx.

So, the volume element is 4 π dplx / plx^5. So, the number of stars in that shell would be (n) * (4 π dplx / plx^5 ), where n is the number density (stars per unit volume).

But the question is about the number of stars per unit range of plx. So, the number per dplx is n * 4 π / plx^5 * dplx / dplx ) = 4 π n / plx^5.

Wait, that can't be right. Because if I'm considering per unit plx, then for a unit change in plx (dplx =1), the number is N = (4 π n ) / plx^5.

So, as plx increases, the number of stars per unit plx decreases as 1/plx^5. But wait, that's not one of the options. The options are 1/plx^1, ^2, ^3, ^4.

Hmm, perhaps I've made a mistake in the approach.

Alternative approach: Maybe it's better to think in terms of solid angle.

Wait, parallax is a measure of distance. So, the number of stars in a certain range of parallax depends on how much volume is associated with that range.

If stars are uniformly distributed, the number density is constant, say n stars per cubic parsec.

The parallax plx is related to distance d by plx = 1/d (in arcseconds and parsecs).

Suppose we're looking at stars with parallax between plx and plx + dplx. What's the corresponding distance range? d ranges from d =1/plx to d = 1/(plx + dplx). For small dplx, we can approximate the distance range as from d to d - (d (dplx)/plx²).

Wait, perhaps it's better to think in terms of the volume between two spheres of radius d and d + dd. The volume is (4/3) π (d+dd)^3 - (4/3) π d^3 ≈ 4 π d^2 dd.

But in this case, since we're considering a range of plx, which translates to a range of d. But wait, the parallax change dplx is the variable we're considering. So, perhaps I should express d in terms of plx.

Let me think again: d = 1/plx. So, dd = - (1/plx²) dplx.

So, the volume element for a thin shell at distance d is 4 π d² dd. Substituting d=1/plx and dd= -d dplx / plx².

So, d² = 1/(plx)^2.

dd = -(1/plx) * dplx / plx² = -dplx / plx^3.

So, volume dV=4 π (1/plx^2) * (dplx / plx^3 ) ) = 4 π dplx / plx^5.

The number of stars in that volume is N = n * dV = n * 4 π dplx / plx^5.

But the number per unit range of plx (dplx) is N/(dplx) = 4 π n / plx^5.

Wait, but none of the options match 1/plx^5. Hmm, that suggests I'm making a mistake somewhere.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Maybe the question is about the number of stars per unit of plx (like per plx unit), and not per unit volume.

Wait, another approach: since parallax is inversely proportional to distance, the number density of stars would be higher in nearby regions. But how does the number of stars vary with plx?

Let me think about the volume a star occupies. The volume element in the direction of the parallax would depend on distance.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think in terms of the number of stars per unit of parallax. Let's imagine that the number of stars per unit volume is constant.

So, the number of stars in a thin shell at distance d with thickness dr is 4πd² dr * n, where n is number density.

But d = 1/plx, so dr = - (1/(plx^2)) dplx.

So substituting, the number is 4π (1/plx)^2 * (-1/(plx^2)) dplx *n.

Wait, that would be 4π n ( - dplx ) / plx^4.

But the negative sign indicates direction; the magnitude is 4π n dplx / plx^4.

So the number of stars per unit change in plx (dplx) is 4π n / plx^4.

Wait, so the number is proportional to 1/plx^4. So the answer would be option A: ~1/plx^4.

But wait, earlier I thought it was 1/plx^5. Hmm, something's not right.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the substitution. Let me go through it again.

d = 1/plx.

The volume element for a shell at distance d is 4π d² dr.

We have dr = (dd) = - (1/plx^2) dplx.

So, substituting:

dV = 4 π (1/plx)^2 * (-1/plx^2 dplx) )

= 4 π (-dplx) / plx^4.

The negative sign indicates that as plx increases, d decreases.

The number of stars in this volume is n * dV, which is 4 π n (-dplx) / plx^4.

But since dplx is a positive change in plx, the negative cancels out, and the number of stars is 4 π n dplx / plx^4.

So the number per unit change in plx (dplx) is 4 π n / plx^4.

So, the number of stars per unit plx is proportional to 1/plx^4, which is option A.

But wait, the options are:

A) ~ 1/plx^4

B) ~1/plx^2

C) ~ 1/plx^1

D) ~1/plx^3

So the correct answer would be A.

But wait, how does this make sense? Because on the parallax axis, each unit of plx corresponds to a larger volume as plx decreases (since plx is smaller for more distant stars), leading to fewer stars per unit plx.

Wait no, higher plx means closer stars. So for small plx (large distance), the number of stars per unit plx would be lower. So, the number should decrease as plx increases.

Which matches with 1/plx^4, since as plx increases, 1/plx^4 decreases.

Yes, that makes sense.

Wait, but earlier I thought the number was proportional to 1/plx^5, but perhaps I made a mistake in the substitution earlier.

Wait, perhaps I was correct the first time, but let me double-check.

Another approach: Let's consider that the number of stars in a volume dV is n * dV.

The parallax plx is 1/d, so d = 1/plx. The volume element in spherical shells is dV = 4 π d² dd.

So, substituting d = 1/plx, dd = - (1/plx^2) dplx.

So, dV =4 π (1/plx)^2 * (-1/plx^2 dplx) ) = -4 π (dplx) / plx^4.

So, the number of stars is N = n * dV = -4 π n dplx / plx^4.

But we're interested in the number per unit plx, which is N / dplx = (-4 π n ) / plx^4.

So, the number is proportional to 1/plx^4.

So the correct answer is A.

But wait, another way to think about it: The number of stars per unit volume is constant. So, as we consider stars within a certain distance range, the number increases with the volume. But when we look at a range of plx, which is 1/d, the volume associated with that range depends on how d changes with plx.

Alternatively, because plx is inversely proportional to d, the volume per unit plx increases as d^3, but since d is proportional to 1/plx, that would make the volume proportional to 1/plx^3. So the number of stars per unit plx would be proportional to 1/plx^3 times 1/(d^3), which doesn't quite fit. Hmm, maybe that's not the right way.

Wait, perhaps considering the differential. The number of stars with parallax between plx and plx + dplx is N = n * dV.

We have dV = 4π d² dd.

But since plx = 1/d, dd = - (1/plx²) dplx.

So, dV =4 π (1/plx)^2 * (d d) = 4 π (1/plx^2) * ( -1/plx² dplx ) ) = 4 π ( -dplx ) / plx^4.

Wait, so N = n * 4 π ( -dplx ) / plx^4.

So, the number per unit plx is N/dplx = -4 π n / plx^4, which is 1/plx^4.

So the answer is A.


To determine how the number of stars per unit range of parallax (plx) changes with plx, we start by noting that parallax is inversely proportional to distance: 

\[
\text{plx} = \frac{1}{d}, \quad \text{where } d \text{ is in parsecs}.
\]

The question assumes stars are uniformly distributed, meaning the number density of stars (\(n\)) is constant. The number of stars in a thin spherical shell at distance \(d\) with thickness \(dd\) is given by:

\[
N = n \cdot dV,
\]

where \(dV = 4\pi d^2 dd\) is the volume of the shell. Substituting \(d = 1/\text{plx}\), we find:

\[
dd = -\frac{1}{\text{plx}^2} d\text{plx}.
\]

Thus, the volume element becomes:

\[
dV = 4\pi \left(\frac{1}{\text{plx}}\right)^2 \cdot \left(-\frac{1}{\text{plx}^2} d\text{plx}\right) = \frac{-4\pi d\text{plx}}{\text{plx}^4}.
\]

The number of stars in this shell is:

\[
N = n \cdot dV = n \cdot \frac{-4\pi d\text{plx}}{\text{plx}^4}.
\]

The number of stars per unit range of parallax (\(d\text{plx}\)) is then:

\[
\frac{N}{d\text{plx}} = \frac{n \cdot (-4\pi)}{\text{plx}^4}.
\]

This shows that the number of stars per unit range of parallax decreases as \(\sim 1/\text{plx}^4\). Therefore, the correct answer is:

**A) ~ 1/plx^4**

Answer: A
