Okay, so I've got this question about symmetries in the Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT). Hmm, I remember that SMEFT is an effective theory that incorporates the Standard Model with higher-dimensional operators to account for new physics beyond the SM. But I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact symmetries that the operators must respect.

The question asks which symmetries must be respected by all operators in SMEFT. The options are Lorentz, Poincare, CP, and CPT. The choices are combinations of these, labeled A to D.

Wait, I think I should start by recalling what each of these symmetries entails. Lorentz symmetry has to do with the invariance under Lorentz transformations, which include rotations and boosts. Poincare symmetry is a combination of Lorentz symmetry and translations in spacetime, so if Lorentz is respected, Poincare might automatically be considered? Or wait, no, because Poincare includes things like momentum conservation. But I'm not sure how that ties in for SMEFT operators.

CP symmetry is Charge conjugation combined with Parity. CPT symmetry involves Charge, Parity, and Time reversal. I remember that in quantum field theory, CPT is a fundamental symmetry; every theory that respects P and T might not necessarily respect CPT, but I think CPT is always a symmetry, especially in theories that are Lorentz invariant.

Wait, wait. SMEFT is built as an effective theory based on the Standard Model, which does respect Lorentz symmetry. So the operators must also respect Lorentz symmetry. That makes sense because the SM is Lorentz-invariant, and SMEFT extends it.

Now, what about Poincare symmetry? Poincare includes Lorentz plus translations. So if the theory respects Lorentz, do the operators automatically respect Poincare? Because the operators are local, I think they have to be Poincare invariant. So maybe both Lorentz and Poincare symmetries are required. Or perhaps Poincare is a broader symmetry that includes Lorentz, so if operators respect Lorentz, they also respect Poincare? I'm a bit confused here.

Wait, no. Because Poincare includes not just Lorentz transformations but also spacetime translations. So even if operators are Lorentz invariant, they might not be invariant under translations, but wait, operators in a QFT are local, so they should be built from fields that transform appropriately under Poincare. Hmm, perhaps the SMEFT operators are constructed as local operators, meaning they must transform correctly under Poincare symmetry. So
