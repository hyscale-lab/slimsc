--- Full Content ---
Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider, RHIC. The question is asking for the energy of the collider such that the speed of nucleus X is 0.96 times the speed of light, c. Hmm, alright, I need to figure this out step by step.

First, I should probably identify what the nucleus X is. The problem says X is Li with 3 neutrons. Wait, Li is lithium. So lithium normally has 3 protons, right? But with 3 neutrons, that makes it lithium-6 because 3 protons + 3 neutrons = 6 nucleons. So the mass number A is 6. So the nucleus is ^6Li.

Next, the problem is about relativistic speeds. The speed is 0.96c, which is pretty high. So I remember that when dealing with relativistic speeds, we can't use classical mechanics. We have to use the relativistic equations.

The energy of a particle in relativity is given by the total energy, which includes both rest mass energy and kinetic energy. The formula for total energy is E = gamma * m0 * c². Gamma is the Lorentz factor, which is 1 / sqrt(1 - (v²/c²)).

Wait, but sometimes in these problems, the energy given is the kinetic energy, not the total energy. Oh, wait, the question is asking for the energy of the collider, which I think refers to the kinetic energy imparted to the nucleus. Or does it? Because sometimes colliders state their energy as the total energy, but I'm not entirely sure. I'll have to think about this.

Wait, the options are in GeV, which are units of energy. So the energy in the question is probably the kinetic energy. Or maybe it's the total energy? Hmm, this is a point I need to clarify.

Wait, no, typically, when a collider's energy is mentioned, it refers to the kinetic energy of the particles. Because the rest mass energy is much smaller, but for heavy ions, it might be a bigger component. Let me think.

Lithium-6 has a mass. Let me calculate its rest mass energy. The mass of a proton is about 938 MeV/c², and a neutron is approximately the same, around 939 MeV/c². So the total rest mass of ^6Li would be approximately 6 * 938 MeV/c² = let's see, 6 * 0.938 GeV is about 5.628 GeV. So the rest mass energy is about 5.628 GeV.

But wait, in reality, the binding energy of the nucleus would make the mass a bit less than the sum of individual nucleons. Because when nucleons bind together, their rest mass decreases. But for a rough calculation, maybe we can approximate the mass as about 6 * 938 MeV/c², but perhaps a bit less. However, since the question is about high energy, and the speed is 0.96c, the kinetic energy is going to be much higher than the rest mass energy. So maybe the rest mass is negligible compared to the kinetic energy. But I don't think that's the case here because 6 GeV is not negligible compared to, say, 20 GeV.

Wait, the options are around 20 GeV, which is about 4 times the rest mass. So the total energy E would be gamma*m0*c². So if the kinetic energy is E_kinetic = (gamma - 1) * m0 c², and the total energy is gamma*m0 c².

So I think the question is asking for the total energy, which would be gamma multiplied by the rest mass energy. Or wait, perhaps the question is asking for the kinetic energy. The wording says, "the energy of the RHIC so that the speed of the nucleus X is equal to 0.96c." So energy probably refers to the kinetic energy. Hmm, but I'm a bit uncertain. Let me proceed and see.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem states that the speed is 0.96c, and the energy is the total energy. But I need to figure this out.

First, let's compute gamma. v = 0.96c.

Gamma is 1 / sqrt(1 - (v²/c²)).

So v = 0.96c, so v² = (0.96)^2 c² = 0.9216 c².

1 - v²/c² = 1 - 0.9216 = 0.0784.

sqrt(0.0784) = 0.28. So gamma is 1/0.28 ≈ 3.5714.

Wait, precise calculation: 0.96 squared is 0.9216, correct. 1 - 0.9216 is 0.0784. The square root of 0.0784 is 0.28 (since 0.28^2 is 0.0784). So gamma is 1/0.28 = approximately 3.57142857.

So gamma is about 3.5714.

Now, the rest mass of ^6Li: Let's get a more accurate value.

Wait, the actual mass of ^6Li is less than 6 times the mass of a proton. Because when you form a nucleus, you lose some mass due to binding energy. The exact mass can be looked up, but I don't have that data here. Hmm. So perhaps I can approximate it. Alternatively, maybe I can use the molar mass to find the mass.

Wait, the molar mass of Li-6 is about 6 grams per mole. Wait, no, that's not right. The molar mass of Li is about 7 grams per mole, but Li-6 is only about 89% abundant, and Li-7 is about 11% abundant. Wait, but the molar mass is approximately 7 g/mol. But perhaps that's complicating things.

Alternatively, perhaps the mass of ^6Li is approximately 6 * (proton mass + neutron mass) minus the binding energy. But without exact numbers, maybe I can just use the mass as 6 * (proton mass) for an approximation, and then see which option aligns.

Wait, but that's not accurate. Let me think another way. The mass number A is 6, so the mass is approximately 6 * u, where u is the atomic mass unit (approximately 1.66e-27 kg). But to find the mass in kg, that would be 6 * 1.66e-27 kg = 9.96e-27 kg. But wait, that's the mass assuming no binding energy, which isn't correct. The actual mass is slightly less because of the binding energy.

But perhaps for the sake of this problem, we can use the rest mass as approximately 6 * (mass of proton). Wait, the proton mass is about 1.67e-27 kg, but that's in kg. Alternatively, the mass of ^6Li is about 6 * (1.67e-27 kg) minus some binding energy.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to compute the rest mass energy in GeV. Let's see. The rest mass energy of a proton is about 938 MeV, which is 0.938 GeV. So for ^6Li, the rest mass energy is 6 * 0.938 GeV = 5.628 GeV. But again, the actual mass is less because of binding energy. Let's say the actual rest mass energy is about 5.628 GeV minus, say, 0.1 GeV? I'm not sure, but perhaps for the problem's purpose, the rest mass is about 5.6 GeV.

So, the total energy E is gamma * m0 c². So E = gamma * m0 c².

If the speed is 0.96c, then gamma is approximately 3.5714, as we found earlier.

So E = 3.5714 * 5.628 GeV ≈ 3.5714 * 5.628.

Let me compute that.

3.5714 * 5 = 17.857

3.5714 * 0.628 ≈ 3.5714 * 0.6 is about 2.1428, and 3.5714 * 0.028 is about 0.100. So total is 2.1428 + 0.100 = 2.2428.

So E ≈ 17.857 + 2.2428 = 20.0998 GeV. Approximately 20.1 GeV.

Looking at the options:

A) 18.475 GeV

B) 23.069 GeV

C) 20.132 GeV

D) 21.419 GeV

So option C is 20.132 GeV, which is very close to our approximate calculation of 20.1 GeV. So that's promising.

Wait, but wait a minute. What if the energy being referred to is the kinetic energy, not the total energy?

Because sometimes, the energy given in colliders is the kinetic energy. So I need to be careful.

The kinetic energy is (gamma - 1) * m0 c².

So, if gamma is 3.5714, then KE = (3.5714 - 1) * 5.628 GeV = 2.5714 * 5.628 GeV.

2.5714 * 5 is 12.857.

2.5714 * 0.628 ≈ 2.5714 * 0.6 is 1.5428, and 2.5714 * 0.028 ≈ 0.072. So total is approximately 1.5428 + 0.072 ≈ 1.6148.

So KE ≈ 12.857 + 1.6148 = about 14.4718 GeV.

But none of the options are around 14 GeV. The options go from 18 up to 23. So that suggests that the energy referred to is the total energy, not the kinetic.

So I think the answer is about 20.1 GeV, which is option C.

But wait, maybe I made a mistake in the rest mass calculation. Let me think again. The rest mass of ^6Li is not exactly 6 * 938 MeV/c². Because when you form a nucleus, you lose mass, so the actual rest mass is a bit less.

Let me look for the actual mass of ^6Li. Oh wait, I can't check exact values right now, but perhaps I can approximate it.

The binding energy per nucleon in light nuclei is lower than in heavier ones. For example, in helium-4, the binding energy is about 28 MeV. For lithium-6, perhaps the binding energy is around, say, 20 MeV total. So for ^6Li, the binding energy is about 20 MeV. So the actual rest mass would be 6 * 938 MeV - 20 MeV. Because binding energy is the mass deficit.

So 6 * 938 = 5628 MeV. Subtract 20 MeV gives 5608 MeV, which is 5.608 GeV.

So m0 c² is about 5.608 GeV.

Then, E = gamma * m0 c² = 3.5714 * 5.608 GeV.

Let me compute 3.5714 * 5.608.

3 * 5.608 = 16.824

0.5714 * 5.608 ≈ 0.5 *5.608 = 2.804, 0.0714 *5.608 ≈ 0.402 → total 2.804 + 0.402 = 3.206.

So 16.824 +3.206 =20.03 GeV.

Hmm, so about 20.03 GeV. Looking at option C, which is 20.132 GeV. Close enough, but perhaps the rest mass is a bit higher.

Alternatively, maybe the binding energy is less than 20 MeV. Let's say 15 MeV. Then, m0 c² is 5.628 - 0.015 =5.613 GeV.

So E = 3.5714 *5.613.

3 *5.613=16.839.

0.5714 *5.613: let's compute 0.5*5.613=2.8065, 0.0714 *5.613≈0.402 → total 3.2085.

So 16.839 +3.2085=20.0475 GeV.

Still around 20.05 GeV. Option C is 20.132, which is a bit higher. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe I underestimated the binding energy. If the binding energy is lower, like 10 MeV, then m0 c² would be 5.628 -0.01 =5.618 GeV.

3.5714 *5.618 = 3 *5.618=16.854, 0.5714 *5.618=3.207 → 16.854 +3.207=20.061 GeV.

Still, option C is 20.132, which is a bit higher.

Alternatively, perhaps the initial approximation of the rest mass is too low. Because the actual rest mass of ^6Li is about 6 * (mass of protons and neutrons) minus the binding energy. Maybe the binding energy is around 10 MeV, so the rest mass is about 5.618 GeV.

But then 3.5714 *5.618 is about 20.06 GeV.

Wait, but another thought: when dealing with heavy ions in colliders, sometimes the energy per nucleon is a term used. But I don't think that's the case here. The question is about the nucleus speed, so it's the total energy of the nucleus that matters.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute gamma more accurately.

Let me re-calculate gamma. v =0.96c.

v²/c² = (0.96)^2 = 0.9216.

1 - v²/c²=0.0784.

sqrt(0.0784)= 0.28.

So gamma is 1/0.28 = 3.57142857.

But perhaps I should compute it more precisely.

Wait, let's compute 0.96 squared more precisely.

0.96 *0.96 = (0.9 +0.06)^2 = 0.81 + 2*0.9*0.06 +0.0036 = 0.81 +0.108 +0.0036 = 0.9216.

So sqrt(0.0784) = 0.28 exactly? Wait, 0.28 squared is 0.0784, correct. So gamma is exactly 1/0.28 = 3.57142857.

So if the rest mass energy is accurately known, E would be gamma multiplied by that.

Alternatively, perhaps I should calculate more accurately the actual rest mass energy of ^6Li.

The actual atomic mass of ^6Li is about 6.015 g/mol (since Li-6 has a molar mass of about 6.015 g/mol). Wait, no, the molar mass of Li is about 7 g/mol, but if it's ^6Li, the molar mass is approximately 6.94 g/mol? Wait, perhaps I should get the actual atomic mass of ^6Li.

Wait, the standard atomic weight of lithium is about 6.94 g/mol, which is an average including both Li-6 and Li-7. Since Li-6 is about 89% and Li-7 is about 11%, the exact molar mass of Li-6 is about 6.94 * (6.94 / (0.89)) ? Hmm, that's getting complicated. Alternatively, I can look up the exact mass of ^6Li.

But since I don't have exact numbers, perhaps I can use the following approach. The mass of ^6Li is 6.015 atomic mass units (u). Wait, the exact value is 6.0150866 u for ^6Li. Let me check that. Oh wait, I can't look it up right now, but I think ^6Li has a mass of about 6.015 u.

An atomic mass unit (u) is approximately 1.6605e-27 kg. So the mass of ^6Li is about 6.015 u = 6.015 *1.6605e-27 kg ≈ 9.977e-27 kg.

Then, the rest mass energy is m c². c is approximately 3e8 m/s.

So m c² = 9.977e-27 kg * (3e8 m/s)^2 = 9.977e-27 *9e16 = 8.9793e-10 J.

To convert Joules to GeV, we use 1 eV = 1.602e-19 J. So 1 GeV = 1e9 eV = 1.602e-10 J.

So (8.9793e-10 J) / (1.602e-10 J/GeV) ) = approximately 5.605 GeV.

So m c² ≈5.605 GeV.

Now, E = gamma * m c² = 3.5714 * 5.605 GeV.

Calculating 3.5714 *5.605.

Let me compute this step by step.

3 *5.605 =16.815.

0.5714 *5.605:

0.5 *5.605 =2.8025.

0.0714 *5.605 ≈0.4024.

So 2.8025 +0.4024=3.2049.

Adding to 16.815: 16.815 +3.2049=20.0199 GeV.

So approximately 20.02 GeV.

Looking at the options, option C is 20.132 GeV, which is close but a bit higher.

Hmm, perhaps I made an approximation in the mass. Let me think: the exact mass of ^6Li is 6.0150866 u. So 6.0150866 *1.6605e-27 kg.

Wait, 6.0150866 *1.6605e-27 = ?

Let me compute 6 *1.6605e-27 = 9.963e-27, 0.0150866 *1.6605e-27 ≈ 2.504e-29.

So total m = 9.963e-27 + 2.504e-29 = approximately 9.988e-27 kg.

So m c² = 9.988e-27 kg * (3e8)^2 = 9.988e-27 *9e16 = 8.9892e-10 J.

Convert to GeV: 8.9892e-10 J / 1.602e-10 J/GeV ≈5.608 GeV.

So E =3.5714 *5.608 GeV.

Compute this:

3.5714 *5 =17.857

3.5714 *0.608 = ?

0.6 *3.5714=2.1428

0.008 *3.5714=0.0285

So 2.1428 +0.0285=2.1713.

So total E=17.857 +2.1713=20.0283 GeV.

Approximately 20.028 GeV.

Looking at the options, option C is 20.132 GeV. That's about 0.1 GeV higher. Hmm, maybe the rest mass is higher. Did I miss something?

Alternatively, perhaps the calculation should consider that the rest mass energy is higher. Let's see: if the actual rest mass energy is 5.628 GeV (without considering binding energy), then E=3.5714 *5.628=?

3.5714 *5 =17.857

3.5714 *0.628=2.2428.

So E=20.1 GeV.

Which aligns with option C, which is 20.132 GeV. So perhaps the rest mass is closer to 5.628 GeV.

So taking into account that the actual rest mass of ^6Li is 5.615 GeV (I think that's more accurate—perhaps the exact value is 5.605 to 5.628 GeV), then with gamma 3.5714, the E is approximately 20.02 to 20.1 GeV.

So the closest option is C) 20.132 GeV.

But wait, let me think again. If I compute it more accurately.

Gamma is 3.57142857.

Rest mass energy m0 c² =5.605 GeV.

So E =3.57142857 *5.605 = ?

Let me compute 3.57142857 *5.605:

Breaking it down:

=3.57142857 *5 +3.57142857 *0.605

= 17.85714285 + 2.16071428

Wait, 3.57142857 *0.605:

0.6 *3.57142857=2.14285714

0.005 *3.57142857=0.01785714

So 2.14285714 +0.01785714=2.16071428.

So 17.85714285 +2.16071428=20.01785713 GeV.

Approximately 20.0179 GeV.

But option C is 20.132 GeV. Hmm, that's about 0.1 GeV higher. So either I made a mistake in the rest mass calculation, or perhaps I should consider that the mass is higher.

Wait, perhaps the mass includes the binding energy. Wait no, the rest mass is less when considering binding energy. So if the actual mass is 5.605 GeV, then E is 20.0179 GeV.

But none of the options match that exactly. The closest option is C) 20.132 GeV, which is about 0.11 GeV higher.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the kinetic energy. If that's the case, then KE = (gamma -1) * m0 c².

gamma is 3.5714, so KE=2.5714 *5.605 GeV.

2.5714 *5 =12.857

2.5714 *0.605=1.556.

So KE≈14.413 GeV.

But that's not matching any of the options. So probably, the energy is total energy.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that the nucleus is a heavy ion with multiple nucleons, but the kinetic energy is per nucleon. But I don't think that's the case here.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm supposed to calculate the total kinetic energy of all the nucleons, but that doesn't make sense in this context.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use the relativistic energy formula where E² = (pc)² + (m c²)^2. But I think I applied that correctly through gamma.

Wait, another thought: The problem says "the energy of the RHIC so that the speed of the nucleus X is equal to 0.96c". So perhaps the energy is the kinetic energy, not the total energy.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think again:

In particle physics, when you say the energy of a particle in a collider, you usually refer to the kinetic energy plus the rest mass energy. Because the total energy is the sum of rest mass and kinetic.

But when a collider is said to have an energy of E GeV, it's often the kinetic energy. For example, protons in the LHC have kinetic energies around 6.5 TeV, but their total energy is gamma * m_p c², which is much higher.

Wait, no, the LHC's energy is given as the total energy per proton, which is about 6.5 TeV. Because each proton has a rest mass of ~0.938 GeV, and at 0.9999c, gamma is about 3735, so the total energy is about 3.4 TeV per proton. So the energy in the LHC is the total energy, not just the kinetic.

Wait, no, wait. Let me think again. The LHC's protons are accelerated to an energy of 6.5 TeV per beam. But that's the total energy, including rest mass. So each proton has E = gamma m_p c² ≈6.5 TeV.

So the question's wording says "the energy of the RHIC", which would imply the total energy, not just the kinetic. So I think I was correct earlier to calculate the total energy as gamma * m c².

So with that, our calculation was around 20.0179 GeV, but the closest option is C) 20.132 GeV.

Alternatively, perhaps the actual rest mass is slightly higher. Let me recalculate the rest mass more accurately.

The exact mass of ^6Li is approximately 6.0150866 u.

So m =6.0150866 u *1.66053906660e-27 kg/u ≈6.0150866 *1.6605390666e-27 kg.

Calculating that:

6 *1.6605390666e-27 =9.9632344e-27 kg.

0.0150866 *1.6605390666e-27 =0.0150866 *1.6605390666e-27 ≈2.503e-29 kg.

Total m ≈9.9632344e-27 +2.503e-29 =approximately 9.98826e-27 kg.

m c² =9.98826e-27 kg * (3e8)^2 =9.98826e-27 *9e16 = 8.989434e-10 J.

Convert to GeV: 1 GeV =1.602176634e-10 J.

So E_rest =8.989434e-10 /1.602176634e-10 ≈5.606 GeV.

So E_rest ≈5.606 GeV.

gamma is 3.57142857.

So E_total = 3.57142857 *5.606 GeV.

Compute this:

3.57142857 *5 =17.85714285.

3.57142857 *0.606 = ?

Let's compute 3.57142857 *0.6 =2.14285714.

3.57142857 *0.006 =0.02142857.

Adding these gives 2.14285714 +0.02142857=2.16428571.

So E_total =17.85714285 +2.16428571=20.02142856 GeV ≈20.0214 GeV.

So approximately 20.0214 GeV.

Looking at the options, option C is 20.132 GeV, which is a bit higher. So perhaps I made a mistake in the rest mass.

Alternatively, perhaps the rest mass is 5.628 GeV, as I originally thought. Let me compute that.

E_total=3.57142857 *5.628 GeV.

3 *5.628=16.884.

0.57142857 *5.628.

0.5 *5.628=2.814.

0.07142857 *5.628≈0.404.

So 2.814 +0.404=3.218.

So E=16.884 +3.218=20.102 GeV.

Ah, that brings us to approximately 20.102 GeV. Which is very close to option C, which is 20.132 GeV.

So perhaps the rest mass is 5.628 GeV. So maybe the problem is assuming that the rest mass is 6 * 0.938 GeV, without accounting for binding energy.

In that case, E_total=20.102 GeV, which is 20.102, and option C is 20.132, which is about 0.03 GeV higher.

Hmm, but why is there a discrepancy?

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute gamma more accurately. Let me re-calculate gamma.

v =0.96c.

v²/c² =0.96^2=0.9216.

1 - v²/c²=0.0784.

sqrt(0.0784)=0.28 exactly.

gamma=1/0.28=3.5714285714.

So that part is correct.

So perhaps the rest mass is 5.628 GeV, leading to E=3.5714 *5.628=20.102 GeV.

But the option is 20.132 GeV, which is about 0.03 GeV higher.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the rest mass calculation. Let me compute 6.015 u in GeV.

Wait, 1 u is approximately 0.9315 GeV/c². So the rest mass energy is 6.015 u *0.9315 GeV/u.

So 6.015 *0.9315 ≈?

6 *0.9315=5.589.

0.015 *0.9315=0.0139725.

Total =5.589 +0.0139725=5.6029725 GeV.

So m0 c² ≈5.603 GeV.

So E_total=3.5714 *5.603=?

3 *5.603=16.809.

0.5714 *5.603:

0.5 *5.603=2.8015.

0.0714 *5.603≈0.402.

So total 2.8015 +0.402=3.2035.

So E=16.809 +3.2035=20.0125 GeV.

Still, that's around 20.0125 GeV, which is still not matching option C.

Hmm, perhaps the correct calculation is option C, and my rest mass is a bit off. Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects the gamma to be multiplied by the rest mass as 6 * m_p, without considering binding energy.

Assuming m0 c²=6 *0.938 GeV=5.628 GeV.

Then E=3.5714 *5.628=20.102 GeV.

Which is very close to option C (20.132 GeV). Given that the problem's options have a precision of 1e-4, perhaps the exact calculation yields 20.132 GeV.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute gamma with more precise numbers.

Wait, let me compute gamma again.

v=0.96c.

v²/c²=0.9216.

1 - v²/c²=0.0784.

sqrt(0.0784)=0.28 exactly, as before.

So gamma=1/0.28=3.5714285714.

But perhaps using more precise value.

Alternatively, perhaps the initial assumption is incorrect, and the speed is such that gamma is taken as 3.5714, but the rest mass is a bit higher.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the energy per nucleon and then multiply by the number of nucleons, but that's not applicable here.

Another thought: perhaps the question is considering kinetic energy, but that leads to around 14.4 GeV, which doesn't match any options.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute gamma as 3.5714 and multiply by the rest mass, which is 5.603 GeV, leading to E=20.01 GeV, which isn't an option. So perhaps the given options have more precise numbers.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the exact value using more precise gamma.

Wait, gamma=1/sqrt(1-0.96^2) =1/sqrt(0.0784)=1/0.28=3.5714285714.

So, if the rest mass is 5.603 GeV, E=3.5714285714 *5.603.

Let me compute 3.5714285714 *5.603.

Breaking it down:

3 *5.603 =16.809.

0.5714285714 *5.603.

Compute 0.5 *5.603=2.8015.

0.0714285714 *5.603.

0.07 *5.603=0.39221.

0.0014285714 *5.603≈0.0079998.

So 0.0714285714 *5.603≈0.39221+0.0079998=0.4002098.

So total for 0.5714285714 *5.603: 2.8015 +0.4002098=3.2017098.

So E=16.809 +3.2017098=20.0107098 GeV.

Still, approximately 20.0107 GeV.

So none of the options are exactly this. The closest is option C, which is 20.132 GeV, but that's 0.12 GeV higher.

Wait, maybe I should recheck the rest mass.

Wait, using the exact calculation:

m =6.0150866 u.

1 u =931.5 MeV/c².

So m c² =6.0150866 *931.5 MeV.

Compute 6 *931.5 MeV =5589 MeV.

0.0150866 *931.5 ≈14.03 MeV.

So total m c²=5589 +14.03=5603.03 MeV=5.60303 GeV.

So m c²=5.60303 GeV.

So E=3.5714285714 *5.60303.

Compute:

3 *5.60303 =16.80909.

0.5714285714 *5.60303.

0.5 *5.60303=2.801515.

0.0714285714 *5.60303.

0.07 *5.60303=0.3922121.

0.0014285714*5.60303=0.0079998.

So 0.0714285714 *5.60303≈0.3922121 +0.0079998=0.4002119.

So 0.5714285714 *5.60303=2.801515 +0.4002119=3.2017269.

So E_total=16.80909 +3.2017269=20.0108169 GeV.

Approximately 20.0108 GeV.

So none of the options are 20.0108 GeV.

Looking again, the options are:

A) 18.475 GeV

B) 23.069 GeV

C) 20.132 GeV

D) 21.419 GeV

Hmm, the closest is option C (20.132 GeV) which is about 0.12 GeV higher.

Wait, perhaps the rest mass is higher. Let me compute m c² when m =6.046 u.

Wait, no, I think that's not the case.

Wait, perhaps the error is because the speed is 0.96c, but perhaps the calculation should be more precise. Let me compute gamma more precisely.

v=0.96c.

v²/c²=0.96^2=0.9216.

1 -v²/c²=0.0784.

sqrt(0.0784)=0.28 exactly.

So gamma=1/0.28=3.571428571.

Hmm, that's correct.

Wait, perhaps the initial assumption that the mass is 6.015 u is incorrect. Let me think again about the actual mass.

Wait, the exact mass of ^6Li is 6.0150866 u. So m c²=6.0150866 *931.5 MeV =6.0150866 *931.5.

Compute that:

6 *931.5 =5589 MeV.

0.0150866 *931.5 ≈14.03 MeV.

So total m c²=5589 +14.03=5603.03 MeV=5.60303 GeV.

So E=3.571428571 *5.60303 GeV.

Which as before is approximately 20.0108 GeV.

But the option C is 20.132 GeV, which is 0.12 GeV higher.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is to compute the kinetic energy as (gamma-1)*m c² and see if any option aligns.

KE = (3.571428571-1)*5.60303 GeV =2.571428571 *5.60303 GeV.

Compute 2.571428571 *5.60303.

Let me compute 2*5.60303=11.20606.

0.571428571 *5.60303.

0.5 *5.60303=2.801515.

0.071428571 *5.60303 ≈0.40021.

So 2.801515 +0.40021=3.201725.

So KE=11.20606 +3.201725=14.407785 GeV.

Which isn't close to any options.

Thus, it's more likely that the question is asking for the total energy, leading to approximately 20.01 GeV, but the only option close is C) 20.132 GeV.

Alternatively, perhaps the speed is given as 0.96c, but the exact calculation requires more precise gamma.

Wait, perhaps the speed isn't exactly 0.96c but a speed very close to it, leading to a slightly higher gamma.

Wait, let me compute gamma more accurately.

Wait, v=0.96c.

v^2 = (0.96c)^2 =0.9216 c^2.

Thus, 1 - v^2/c^2=0.0784.

sqrt(0.0784)=0.28.

So gamma=1/0.28=3.57142857.

So no, that's exact.

Hmm.

Given that, perhaps the correct answer is option C) 20.132 GeV, and the slight discrepancy is due to the rest mass being slightly higher than my calculation.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use the exact value of gamma = 3.5714285714.

E=3.5714285714 *5.60303 GeV.

Which as computed earlier is approximately 20.0108 GeV.

But perhaps I should compute it more accurately.

Let me compute 3.5714285714 *5.60303.

Let me write it as:

3.5714285714 ×5.60303 = ?

Let me break it down.

3.5714285714 ×5 =17.857142857.

3.5714285714 ×0.60303.

Compute 3.5714285714 ×0.6 =2.1428571428.

3.5714285714 ×0.00303=0.0108245714.

So 0.60303 ×3.5714285714=2.1428571428 +0.0108245714=2.1536817142.

So total E=17.857142857 +2.1536817142=20.01082457 GeV.

Which is approximately 20.0108 GeV.

None of the options match this, but option C is 20.132 GeV, which is 0.12 GeV higher. So perhaps the correct answer is option C, and my rest mass is incorrect.

Alternatively, perhaps I should check what each option's gamma would be.

Wait, perhaps I should compute gamma for each option and see which gives v=0.96c.

Wait, but the question is about the energy leading to v=0.96c.

Wait, perhaps the problem is to find the total energy, which would be gamma multiplied by m c².

But without knowing the exact m c², perhaps I should proceed with the given options.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the total energy as the sum of the rest mass and kinetic energy.

But I'm getting stuck here.

Wait, given that the correct calculation leads to approximately 20.01 GeV and the closest option is C) 20.132 GeV, perhaps the intended answer is option C, which is 20.132 GeV.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the rest mass.

Wait, let me compute 6.0150866 u *931.5 MeV/u.

6.0150866 *931.5 = ?

6 *931.5 =5589.

0.0150866 *931.5=approx 0.015 *931.5=13.9725, plus 0.0000866 *931.5≈0.0807.

So total:5589 +13.9725 +0.0807≈5603.0532 MeV →5.60305 GeV.

So E=3.57142857 *5.60305 GeV.

Which brings us to 3.57142857 *5.60305.

Which is 3.57142857 *5=17.85714285.

3.57142857 *0.60305=?

0.6 *3.57142857=2.14285714.

0.00305 *3.57142857=0.010895238.

So 0.60305 *3.57142857=2.14285714 +0.010895238=2.153752378.

So E=17.85714285 +2.153752378=20.01089523 GeV.

Approximately 20.0109 GeV.

Which again is about 20.01 GeV. So I think the correct answer isn't among the options, but perhaps the intended answer is option C, 20.132 GeV.

Alternatively, perhaps I should re-express gamma more accurately.

Wait, another approach: Let's compute gamma as 1/sqrt(1 - (0.96)^2) =1/sqrt(0.0784)=1/0.28=3.57142857.

Now, the total energy is gamma * m c².

Assuming m c² is 5.60305 GeV.

E=3.57142857 *5.60305 ≈20.01 GeV.

So the answer must be approximately 20.01 GeV. But among the options, the closest is C) 20.132 GeV.

Alternatively, perhaps the rest mass is considered as 5.628 GeV, leading to E=3.5714*5.628=20.102 GeV, which is approximately 20.1 GeV, matching option C.

Thus, based on the given options, the correct answer is option C) 20.132 GeV.


To determine the energy of the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) such that the speed of the nucleus \( X \) (lithium-6, \( ^6\text{Li} \)) is \( 0.96c \), we use relativistic energy equations. The total energy \( E \) of the particle is given by:

\[
E = \gamma m_0 c^2
\]

where \( \gamma \) is the Lorentz factor:

\[
\gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}}
\]

### Step 1: Calculate \( \gamma \)
Given \( v = 0.96c \), we compute:

\[
v^2/c^2 = (0.96)^2 = 0.9216, \quad 1 - v^2/c^2 = 0.0784
\]

\[
\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2} = \sqrt{0.0784} = 0.28, \quad \gamma = \frac{1}{0.28} \approx 3.5714
\]

### Step 2: Rest Mass Energy of \( ^6\text{Li} \)
The rest mass of \( ^6\text{Li} \) is approximately \( 6.015 \, \text{u} \), where \( 1 \, \text{u} = 931.5 \, \text{MeV}/c^2 \). Thus:

\[
m_0 c^2 = 6.015 \times 931.5 \, \text{MeV} = 5603.03 \, \text{MeV} = 5.60303 \, \text{GeV}
\]

### Step 3: Total Energy \( E \)
Using \( \gamma \approx 3.5714 \) and \( m_0 c^2 \approx 5.60303 \, \text{GeV} \), the total energy is:

\[
E = \gamma m_0 c^2 = 3.5714 \times 5.60303 \, \text{GeV}
\]

Breaking this calculation:

\[
3.5714 \times 5 = 17.857, \quad 3.5714 \times 0.60303 \approx 2.1537
\]

\[
E \approx 17.857 + 2.1537 = 20.0107 \, \text{GeV}
\]

### Step 4: Compare with Options
The calculated energy \( E \approx 20.0107 \, \text{GeV} \) is very close to option **C) 20.132 GeV**. The slight discrepancy may arise from approximations in the rest mass or rounding during intermediate steps. Based on the given options, the closest match is:

**C) 20.132 GeV**

### Final Answer:
**Answer: C**
