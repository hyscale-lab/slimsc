Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's read it carefully.

The question is about the luminosities of two stars. Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than Star_2. Also, Star_1's mass is 1.5 times bigger. They used spectroscopy and found that the wavelengths where the stars appear brightest are the same. The radial velocities are 0 for Star_1 and 700 km/s for Star_2. They're assuming the stars radiate as black bodies. The question is, by what factor is Star_1's luminosity greater than Star_2's? The options are A to D, mostly around 2.2 to 2.35.

Hmm. I remember that the luminosity of a star is related to its radius and temperature. The formula I think is L = 4πR²σT⁴, where σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant. So L is proportional to R squared times T to the fourth power.

Wait, but the problem mentions radial velocities. Radial velocity is the speed at which a star is moving towards or away from us. Oh, right! When a star moves towards us, it causes a Doppler shift in the light it emits. If the star is moving towards us, the light is blueshifted; if moving away, it's redshifted.

But how does this relate to the peak wavelength? Oh, right! The peak wavelength of a blackbody is given by Wien's Law: λ_max = (constant) / T. So, if two stars have the same peak wavelength, their temperatures must be the same. Because λ is inversely proportional to temperature.

Wait, but the problem says that the wavelengths at which the stars appeared brightest are the same. So λ_max for both stars is the same. That implies T1 = T2. Oh, because λ_max is proportional to 1/T.

Wait a second, though. Wait, the radial velocities are given. Oh, because the star's motion towards or away from us affects the observed wavelength. So maybe the measured λ_max is different from the actual emitted λ_max?

Wait, that makes sense. Because if a star is moving towards us, the emitted wavelength λ is blueshifted, so the observed λ is shorter than the actual. Conversely, moving away, λ is longer.

So, for Star_2, which has a radial velocity of 700 km/s. Let's see, what's the Doppler shift formula. The relativistic Doppler shift is given by:

λ_observed = λ_rest * sqrt( (1 + v/c) / (1 - v/c) )

But wait, for non-relativistic speeds, we can approximate it as:

λ_observed ≈ λ_rest * (1 + v_r / c )

Wait, no. Wait, if the star is moving towards us, the observed wavelength is shorter, so if the star has a positive radial velocity (moving away), then λ increases. But in this case, Star_1 has radial velocity 0, so its observed λ is the same as its rest wavelength. Star_2 has radial velocity 700 km/s, which I'm assuming is moving away because the radial velocity is positive (but wait, the problem says radial velocities are 0 and 700, but doesn't specify direction. Oh, wait, the problem says radial velocities of 0 and 700 km/s respectively. So Star_1 is not moving towards or away (v=0), so λ_rest is the same as λ_observed. Star_2 is moving at 700 km/s. Let's think: if Star_2 is moving away, its light is redshifted, so its observed λ_max would be longer than its emitted rest λ_max. But the problem says that the measured (observed) λ_max is the same for both stars. So that means that the rest λ_max of Star_2 must be shorter than Star_1's, because when observed, they both have the same λ_max.

Wait, let me think again. Let's denote:

λ₁_observed = λ₁_rest (since v₁=0)
λ₂_observed = λ₂_rest * Doppler factor.

But the problem states that λ₁_observed = λ₂_observed.

So,

λ₁_rest = λ₂_rest * Doppler factor.

But λ is inversely proportional to T. So λ₁_rest = (Lamda) for Star_1's rest frame, λ₂_rest is for Star_2's rest frame.

So, if λ₁_obs = λ₂_obs, which is λ₁_rest = λ₂_obs.

But λ₂_obs is λ₂_rest * Doppler factor.

Hmm, let me formalize this.

Let me denote:

v₂ = 700 km/s. Since it's moving away, the observed wavelength λ₂_obs is longer than λ₂_rest. So the Doppler shift formula is:

λ₂_obs = λ₂_rest * sqrt( (1 + v₂/(c)) / (1 - v₂/(c)) )  [relativistic formula]

But wait, 700 km/s is about 0.00233c (since c is ~3e5 km/s). So v₂/c is about 0.00233, which is small. So we can approximate using the first-order Doppler shift.

The Doppler shift for small velocities is approximately:

λ_obs ≈ λ_rest (1 + v_r / c )

But wait, I'm a little confused about the sign. When the source is moving away (v_r positive, moving away), the observed wavelength increases, so the shift is positive. So,

λ₂_obs = λ₂_rest * (1 + v₂/c )

Similarly, Star_1's observed wavelength is λ₁_obs = λ₁_rest, because v₁=0.

But the problem states that the observed wavelengths are the same.

So,

λ₁_rest = λ₂_obs = λ₂_rest * (1 + v₂/c )

But since λ is inversely proportional to T, λ₁_rest is proportional to 1/T₁, and λ₂_rest is proportional to 1/T₂.

Wait, but according to Wien's law, λ_max is proportional to 1/T. So λ_max = b / T, where b is Wien's displacement constant.

So,

λ₁_rest = b / T₁
λ₂_rest = b / T₂

Thus, from λ₁_rest = λ₂_rest * (1 + v₂/c )

We get:

b/T₁ = (b/T₂) * (1 + v₂/c )

Cancel b from both sides:

1/T₁ = (1/T₂) * (1 + v₂/c )

Rearranging,

T₁ = T₂ / (1 + v₂/c )

Wait, but v₂ is 700 km/s, which is 7e5 m/s. Let me compute v₂/c: 7e5 / 3e8 = approx 0.002333.

So,

1 + v₂/c ≈ 1.002333.

So,

T₁ ≈ T₂ / 1.002333 ≈ 0.99767 T₂.

So, T₁ is slightly less than T₂.

Wait, that's interesting. So Star_2 is hotter than Star_1, because when it's moving away, the observed wavelength is the same, but Star_2's rest frame λ is shorter, which implies higher temperature.

Wait, because Star_2 is moving away, the observed λ is longer, but the actual λ_rest is shorter. Because λ_obs = λ_rest * (1 + v/c), and if λ_obs equals λ₁_rest (since Star_1's λ is not shifted), then:

λ₁_rest = λ₂_rest (1 + v/c )

Which implies λ₂_rest < λ₁_rest, which means T₂ > T₁ because λ is inversely proportional to T.

So, T₂ = T₁ * (1 + v/c ) → because λ₂_rest = λ₁_rest / (1 + v/c )

Wait, let me double-check. From λ₁_rest = λ₂_rest * (1 + v/c )

So, λ₂_rest = λ₁_rest / (1 + v/c )

Since λ is inversely proportional to T, T₂ = T₁ * (1 + v/c )

Because λ₂_rest = (b / T₂) → T₂ = b / λ₂_rest
Similarly, λ₁_rest = b / T₁ → T₁ = b / λ₁_rest.

So,

T₂ = (b) / λ₂_rest = (b) / (λ₁_rest / (1 + v/c )) ) = (b) * (1 + v/c ) / λ₁_rest = (1 + v/c ) * T₁.

So, T₂ = T₁ (1 + v/c )

So, Star_2 is hotter than Star_1 by a factor of approximately 1.002333.

Wait, that's a small difference. But okay, let's proceed.

Now, the problem states that both stars' luminosities are to be calculated as blackbodies. So the luminosity is given by L = 4π R² σ T⁴.

The ratio of luminosities L1 / L2 is (R1² T1⁴ ) / ( R2² T2⁴ )

Because 4π and σ are constants, so they cancel out.

Given that R1 = 1.5 R2.

So,

L1 / L2 = ( (1.5 R2 )^2 * ( T1 )^4 ) / ( (R2)^2 * (T2)^4 ) )

Simplify:

= ( (2.25 R2²) * T1^4 ) / ( R2² T2^4 )
= 2.25 * (T1/T2)^4

But earlier, we found that T2 = T1 (1 + v/c ) → T1 = T2 / (1 + v/c )

So,

(T1/T2) = 1/(1 + v/c )

Wait, no, because T2 = T1 (1 + v/c ), so T1 = T2 / (1 + v/c )

So,

(T1/T2) = 1/(1 + v/c )

So,

(T1/T2)^4 = 1/(1 + v/c )^4

So,

L1/L2 = 2.25 * 1/( (1 + v/c )^4 )

Wait, but that's not right because T1 is smaller than T2. Let me plug in the numbers.

Wait, what's v/c? v is 700 km/s, so v = 700,000 m/s.

c is about 3e8 m/s, so v/c is 7e5 / 3e8 = 0.002333...

So,

(1 + v/c ) ≈ 1.002333.

So,

(1 + v/c )^4 ≈ (1.002333)^4.

We can approximate (1+x)^n ≈ 1 + nx when x is small.

So, x=0.002333, n=4.

So,

(1.002333)^4 ≈ 1 + 4 * 0.002333 = 1 + 0.009332 = 1.009332.

But to get a more accurate value, perhaps compute it more precisely.

Alternatively, since it's a small x, perhaps 1.002333^4 ≈ 1.00938 (using a calculator-like approach).

But maybe we can proceed with the approximation.

So,

L1/L2 ≈ 2.25 / (1.009332 ) ≈ 2.25 / 1.00933 ≈ 2.229.

Wait, 2.25 / 1.00933:

Let me compute that.

2.25 ÷ 1.00933 → Let's think:

1.00933 is about 1.0093.

So 2.25 / 1.0093.

Hmm, 1.0093 * 2.229 ≈ 2.25?

Wait, 2.229 * 1.0093 ≈ 2.229 + 2.229 * 0.0093.

2.229 * 0.0093 ≈ 0.0207.

So 2.229 + 0.0207 ≈ 2.2497 ≈ 2.25. So yes, 2.229 is approximately the reciprocal.

So,

L1/L2 ≈ 2.229 → which is about 2.23.

Looking at the options, option D is ~2.23.

Wait, but let me double-check the earlier steps to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.

1. They have same observed λ_max → same λ observed.

2. For Star_1, λ_obs = λ_rest (v=0).

3. For Star_2, λ_obs = λ_rest * (1 + v/c ) (approximate non-relativistic Doppler shift).

4. So λ_rest (Star_1) = λ_obs (Star_1) = λ_obs (Star_2) = λ_rest (Star_2) * (1 + v/c )

5. So λ_rest (Star_2) = λ_rest (Star_1) / (1 + v/c )

6. Since λ_rest is inversely proportional to T, T_2 = T_1 * (1 + v/c )

7. Luminosity ratio L1/L2 = (R1^2 T1^4) / (R2^2 T2^4 )

8. R1=1.5 R2 → R1/R2=1.5.

9. T2= T1 (1 + v/c ) → T1= T2 / (1 + v/c )

10. So T1^4 / T2^4 = (1/(1 + v/c ))^4.

11. So,

L1/L2 = (1.5^2) * (1/(1 + v/c )^4 )

= 2.25 * [1/(1.002333)^4 ]

Which is approximately 2.25 * (1/1.00933) ≈ 2.25 * 0.991 → which is approximately 2.229.

So, the factor is approximately 2.23, which is option D.


To determine the factor by which the luminosity of Star_1 is greater than that of Star_2, we use the relationship for stellar luminosity:

\[
L = 4\pi R^2 \sigma T^4
\]

where \( R \) is the radius, \( T \) is the temperature, and \( \sigma \) is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant. The luminosity ratio is given by:

\[
\frac{L_1}{L_2} = \frac{R_1^2 T_1^4}{R_2^2 T_2^4}
\]

### Step 1: Relating the temperatures
The problem states that the observed wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest (\( \lambda_{\text{obs}} \)) are the same for both stars. Using Wien's law, the peak wavelength is inversely proportional to the temperature:

\[
\lambda_{\text{max}} \propto \frac{1}{T}
\]

For Star_1, since its radial velocity is 0, its observed wavelength is the same as its rest wavelength (\( \lambda_{\text{obs,1}} = \lambda_{\text{rest,1}} \)). For Star_2, its observed wavelength is redshifted due to its radial velocity (\( v_2 = 700 \, \text{km/s} \)):

\[
\lambda_{\text{obs,2}} = \lambda_{\text{rest,2}} \cdot \left( 1 + \frac{v_2}{c} \right)
\]

Since \( \lambda_{\text{obs,1}} = \lambda_{\text{obs,2}} \), we equate:

\[
\lambda_{\text{rest,1}} = \lambda_{\text{rest,2}} \cdot \left( 1 + \frac{v_2}{c} \right)
\]

Using \( \lambda_{\text{rest}} \propto \frac{1}{T} \), the temperature ratio becomes:

\[
\frac{T_1}{T_2} = \frac{1}{1 + \frac{v_2}{c}}
\]

### Step 2: Calculating the temperature ratio
The radial velocity of Star_2 is \( v_2 = 700 \, \text{km/s} \), and the speed of light is \( c = 3 \times 10^5 \, \text{km/s} \). Thus:

\[
\frac{v_2}{c} = \frac{700}{300,000} \approx 0.002333
\]

The Doppler factor is:

\[
1 + \frac{v_2}{c} \approx 1.002333
\]

So:

\[
\frac{T_1}{T_2} = \frac{1}{1.002333} \approx 0.99767
\]

### Step 3: Calculating the luminosity ratio
The radius of Star_1 is \( R_1 = 1.5 R_2 \), so:

\[
\frac{R_1}{R_2} = 1.5
\]

The luminosity ratio is:

\[
\frac{L_1}{L_2} = \frac{R_1^2 T_1^4}{R_2^2 T_2^4} = \left( \frac{R_1}{R_2} \right)^2 \cdot \left( \frac{T_1}{T_2} \right)^4
\]

Substituting the values:

\[
\frac{L_1}{L_2} = (1.5)^2 \cdot (0.99767)^4
\]

First, calculate \( (1.5)^2 = 2.25 \). Next, approximate \( (0.99767)^4 \). Using the binomial expansion for small \( x \), where \( x = 0.002333 \):

\[
(1 - x)^4 \approx 1 - 4x = 1 - 4(0.002333) \approx 1 - 0.009333 = 0.990667
\]

Thus:

\[
\frac{L_1}{L_2} \approx 2.25 \cdot 0.990667 \approx 2.23
\]

### Final Answer:
The luminosity of Star_1 is approximately 2.23 times greater than that of Star_2.
