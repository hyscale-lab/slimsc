Okay, so I've got this crystallography problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of these concepts. Let me try to think through this step by step.

The question is about finding the interplanar distance of the (111) plane in a rhombohedral crystal. The given data includes an interatomic distance of 10 Angstroms and all the angles alpha, beta, and gamma are 30 degrees. The options are A to D, and I need to pick the right one.

First, I remember that in crystallography, the interplanar distance (d) for a given plane (hkl) in a crystal lattice can be calculated using the formula derived from the structure factor or the Miller indices. But wait, rhombohedral crystals are a bit tricky because they have all sides equal but the angles aren't necessarily 90 degrees. Oh right, in a rhombohedral lattice, the lattice parameters a, b, c are all the same, so a = b = c. But the angles between them can vary, which is the case here with all 30 degrees.

I think the formula for the interplanar distance in a cubic system is d = a / sqrt(h² + k² + l²). But wait, that's for a cubic system where all angles are 90 degrees. Since this is a rhombohedral (trigonal) system, the formula must be adjusted. Oh, right! The general formula for interplanar distance in a crystal is given by:

1/d² = (h² + k² + l²)/(a²) + (2hk cos α)/(a²) + (2hl cos β)/(a²) + (2kl cos γ)/(a²)

Wait, no, I think I'm mixing things up. Alternatively, for a rhombohedral system, the formula might have a different form. Let me recall. Oh, right, there's a formula that accounts for the non-orthogonal angles. The correct formula for interplanar distance in a rhombohedral crystal is:

d_{hkl} = a / sqrt( (h² + k² + l²) + 2(hk + hl + kl) * cos(α) )

Wait, no, I'm getting a bit confused.
