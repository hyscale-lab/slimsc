Okay, so I've got this question about stars and their effective temperatures based on the excitation of iron atoms in their photospheres. Hmm, let me try to break this down.

The question says that iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to star_2. Oh wait, I remember something about the Boltzmann distribution and excitation levels. The Boltzmann factor tells us about the population of particles in different energy states. The formula is something like (n_i)/(n_j) = exp( -(E_i - E_j)/(k*T) ), where E is the energy difference, k is Boltzmann's constant, and T is temperature.

In this case, the energy difference between the energy levels is given as 1.38e-23 J. Wait, I think that's the same as k, because Boltzmann's constant k is approximately 1.38e-23 J/K. Oh wait, yeah, k = 1.380649e-23 J/K. So the energy difference here is the same as k multiplied by 1 K. Interesting.

So, the ratio of excitation levels (n1/n2) is given as 2, because star_1's atoms are twice as excited. So n1/n2 = 2. Applying the Boltzmann equation: 2 = exp( (E)/(k*T) )? Wait, no, because when E_i > E_j, higher energy level, so if star_1 has higher excitation, maybe higher temperature? Let me think.

Wait, the energy difference is E = E_upper - E_lower. So if the iron atoms in star_1 are more excited, that suggests a higher population in the upper energy level, which would require a higher temperature because the exponential term would be larger when T is higher. So the Boltzmann factor is exp( -ΔE/(k T) ), where ΔE is E_upper - E_lower.

So, for each star, the ratio for that star would be (n_upper)/(n_lower) = exp( -ΔE/(k T) ). But in this problem, the ratio is given as n1_upper/n1_lower = 2, and n2_upper/n2_lower = some value. Wait, no. Wait, wait. The problem says: "iron atoms in the photosphere of star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level when compared to the iron atoms in star_2." So the specific energy level in star_1 is twice as excited as in star_2. Wait, perhaps the ratio is (n1_upper) / (n1_lower) = 2 * (n2_upper / n2_lower) ?

Wait, no, maybe not. Wait, no, the question says "twice as excited in a specific energy level." So perhaps the excitation is the population in the specific level. So for star_1, the population in that level is n1, and for star_2 it's n2. And n1 = 2 * n2.

But the question is about the ratio of excitation between the two
