Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about electric potential energy. Hmm, let's see what it's asking. 

So, there's an isolated system with 13 identical particles, each with a charge of 2e. Oh wait, e is the elementary charge, right? So each charge is 2 times that. And their mass is negligible, so I probably don't have to worry about kinetic energy or anything like that; it's all about the potential energy here.

The setup is that 12 of these charges are constrained to stay at 2 meters from a point P. The 13th charge is fixed at P. So, point P has the 13th charge, and the other 12 are all at a distance of 2 meters from P. That makes sense. 

The question is asking for the minimum energy of the system. Since potential energy is involved, I remember that for point charges, the potential energy is calculated based on their positions and charges. And since these are identical charges, they're all the same, so that should simplify things.

Wait, but energy in what form? Oh right, electric potential energy. The formula for the potential energy between two point charges is U = (k * q1 * q2) / r, where k is Coulomb's constant, approximately 8.988×10^9 N·m²/C². 

But wait, when considering a system of multiple charges, the total potential energy is the sum of the potential energies of each pair. So for N charges, each pair contributes to the total. But since the charges are all the same, I can calculate the number of pairs and multiply by the energy per pair.

Wait, let me think. For 13 charges, how many unique pairs are there? Oh right, it's the combination of 13 taken 2 at a time. The formula for combinations is n(n-1)/2. So 13*12/2 = 78 pairs. But wait, in this case, the 13th charge is fixed at P, and the other 12 are each at 2 meters from P. So each of the 12 charges is at 2m from the 13th charge. So how does that affect the calculation?

Wait, maybe I should model this more carefully. The 13th charge is fixed at P. The other 12 are each at a distance of 2m from P, but are they all at the same point? Or are they arranged in some way around P, all 2m away? Oh, the problem says the 12 are constrained to stay at 2m from P, so I think they are all located on a sphere of radius 2m around P. But since the exact positions don't matter for the potential energy (as long as the distances are known), perhaps each of the 12 charges is at a distance of 2m from the 13th charge.

Wait, but the problem is about the potential energy of the entire system. So the total potential energy U is the sum of the potential energies of each pair of charges. That includes the 13th charge with each of the 12, and the interactions among the 12 themselves.

Ah, right. Because each of the 12 charges also interacts with the others. So I need to calculate two parts: the potential energy between the 13th charge and each of the 12, and the potential energy between each pair of the 12 charges.

Wait, but the 12 charges are all at the same distance from P, but are they arranged symmetrically? Like, are they all 2m from P, but what about their mutual distances? Oh, the problem says each is at 2m from P, but I don't know their positions relative to each other. That complicates things because if they're all on a sphere, their mutual distances vary. Hmm, but for the minimal potential energy, would they arrange themselves in a way that minimizes the total potential energy?

Wait, but the problem states that the 12 are constrained to stay at 2m from P, but their mutual distances are free to vary. So, I'm not sure about that. Hmm. But perhaps the problem assumes that the 12 charges are all at the same point, but that would mean they're overlapping, which isn't likely. Or perhaps the 12 are arranged in such a way that their mutual distances are all equal, but that's not specified. Hmm, perhaps the problem considers that the only interactions are between each of the 12 and the 13th charge at P, and no interactions between the 12 charges themselves. But that can't be right because the other 12 will exert forces on each other.

Wait, but the problem says the system is isolated, so we have to account for all interactions. So we can't ignore the potential energy between the 12 charges. But without knowing their positions, how do we calculate that? Because the potential energy between two charges depends on their separation. Without knowing the exact distances, I can't compute that part.

Wait a minute, perhaps the problem assumes that the 12 charges are all at a great distance apart, so that their mutual interactions are negligible. But that seems unlikely because they are constrained to be exactly at 2m from P. Or perhaps the problem only considers the potential energy between each of the 12 and the 13th charge, and ignores the interactions between the 12. But that would be an approximation, and it's not stated in the problem.

Wait, the problem is about the minimum energy. So perhaps arranging the charges in a way that the potential energy is minimized. For like charges, the potential energy is minimized when they are as far apart as possible. But since they are fixed at 2m from P, perhaps the arrangement would be that they are all as far apart as possible from each other on the sphere. Oh, but without specific information, I'm stuck.

Wait, maybe the problem is simplifying things and only considering the potential energy between each of the 12 and the 13th charge at P. Let me re-read the question.

The question says the 12 are constrained to stay at 2m from P, and the 13th is fixed at P. So each of the 12 is at 2m from P, but their mutual distances are not specified. So the problem is perhaps only considering the potential energy between each of the 12 and the 13th charge. Otherwise, without knowing their mutual distances, the problem can't be solved. Hmm. Maybe that's the approach.

Alternatively, perhaps the 12 are all at the same point, 2m away from P. But that would mean that each of the 12 charges is at a distance of 2m from P, but their mutual distances are zero (they're all at the same point), which would mean infinite potential energy due to overlapping like charges. That can't be the case because the problem is asking for the minimum energy, so that's probably not the setup.

Wait, this is getting a bit confusing. Let me think again.

The system consists of 13 charges: one at P, and 12 at a distance of 2m from P. The 12 are free to move around on the sphere of radius 2m, but their exact positions relative to each other are not specified. Since the problem asks for the minimum energy, perhaps arranging the 12 charges in a way that minimizes the total potential energy. 

But the potential energy between like charges is positive when they repel each other. So, to minimize the energy, the 12 charges would arrange themselves as far apart as possible. The most symmetrical arrangement would be placing them equally spaced on the sphere, each as far as possible from each other. But calculating the exact potential energy for that requires knowing the distances between each pair of the 12, which is probably beyond the scope of this problem.

Wait, but maybe the problem simplifies this by assuming that the 12 charges are all very far apart, so that the potential energy between them is negligible compared to the potential energy each has with the 13th charge. But I don't see any indication of that in the problem statement.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only considering the potential energy between the 13th charge and each of the 12, and ignores the interactions between the 12. But that would be an oversight because each of the 12 charges would exert a force on the others, contributing to the potential energy.

Hmm. Maybe the problem is assuming that the 12 charges are all at the same point, but that would cause their mutual potential energy to be (12 choose 2) times the potential energy between two at that point, but that would be a very large value, which perhaps isn't the case.

Wait, perhaps the problem is only considering the potential energy between each of the 12 and the 13th charge. Let's proceed under that assumption, but I'm not entirely confident. Alternatively, perhaps the 12 charges are arranged in a way that their mutual distances are all 2m, but that's not clear.

Wait, another approach: in electrostatics, the potential energy of a system of multiple charges is the sum of the potential energies of each pair. So for the 13th charge (q13) and each of the 12 charges (q1 to q12), there are 12 interactions. Then, between each pair of the 12 charges, there are (12 choose 2) = 66 interactions. So the total potential energy would be the sum of the 12 interactions (each with r=2m) and the 66 interactions (each with r equal to the distance between the respective two charges of the 12).

But without knowing the distances between the 12, we can't calculate the latter part. Therefore, perhaps the problem is only asking about the potential energy between q13 and the 12 charges, ignoring the interactions among the 12. But the problem states "the minimum energy of this system," which implies that perhaps the other interactions are not considered, maybe because the 12 charges are at a very large distance apart so their mutual potential energy is negligible.

Alternatively, maybe the 12 charges are all at the same point, but that would mean the mutual potential energy is (12 choose 2) * U between two charges at zero distance. Wait, that can't be because at zero distance, the potential energy would be infinite, which doesn't make sense. So perhaps the mutual interactions of the 12 are considered at their mutual distance, but since each is at 2m from P, perhaps they form a regular icosahedron or something, but the exact distances between them would be the same? Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe the problem wants us to consider only the interaction between the 13th charge and each of the 12, and not the interactions among the 12. Let's proceed with that, but I'm a bit uncertain.

So, each of the 12 charges is at a distance of 2m from the 13th charge at P. So, the potential energy between the 13th charge and each of the 12 is U = k * q13 * qi / r.

But wait, all charges are the same, so each qi is 2e. So q13 is also 2e, since all are identical.

Wait, the problem says "13 identical particles each with charge 2e." So each charge is 2e. So the 13th charge is 2e, and each of the other 12 is 2e.

So, the potential energy between the 13th and each of the 12 is U_i = k * (2e) * (2e) / (2 m) — wait, no, wait. Wait, 13th is fixed at P, and each of the 12 is at a distance of 2m from P. So for each of the 12, the potential energy with the 13th is (k * (2e) * (2e)) / 2m.

But wait, for each pair, that's the formula. So each of the 12 contributes (k * (2e)^2) / (2 m) to the potential energy. So total for all 12 is 12 * (k*(2e)^2)/(2m).

Which simplifies to 12 * (k *4e²)/(2*2) )? Wait, wait. Let me recheck.

Wait, the distance is 2 meters, right? So r is 2 m. So U for each pair is k*(2e)*(2e)/(2) = k*(4e²)/(2) = 2 k e².

Wait, because (2e) * (2e) is 4e². Divided by 2 is 2 e² k.

So each of the 12 pairs contributes 2 k e². So the total for all 12 is 12 * 2 k e² = 24 k e².

But wait, wait, wait. Wait, because electric potential energy for a pair is given by U = (k q1 q2) / r. But when considering a system of multiple charges, the total potential energy is the sum of the potential energies of each pair. So in this case, we have 12 pairs (each of the 12 with the 13th). Each pair contributes U = k*(2e)*(2e)/(2m). So yes, that's 4e² k / (2m) = 2 e² k.

Wait, no, no, wait. Wait, 2e * 2e is 4e², correct. Then divided by 2 meters, so 4e²/(2) = 2 e². Multiply by k, so 2 k e².

So each pair contributes 2 k e². 12 pairs, so 12*2 k e² = 24 k e².

But that's only the potential energy between the 13th and the other 12. What about the potential energy between the 12 charges themselves? Oh right, that's another part.

So the 12 charges are all at 2m from P, but their mutual distances are not specified. Without knowing their exact arrangement, it's hard to compute their mutual potential energy. But perhaps the problem assumes that the mutual potential energy is negligible, or that it's part of the minimum energy consideration.

Wait, but the problem is asking for the minimum energy. So, in that case, arranging the 12 charges as far apart as possible would minimize the potential energy (since potential energy between like charges is positive, and we want the minimal, which would be the least positive, so arranging them as far apart as possible).

But without knowing their exact arrangement, perhaps the problem is considering only the potential energy between the 13th charge and the others, and not their mutual interactions. Because otherwise, the problem would require more information.

Alternatively, perhaps the 12 charges are all at a very large distance from each other, so that their mutual potential energy is negligible. If that's the case, then the total potential energy would just be the sum from the 13th charge interactions.

But that seems a bit of a stretch, as the problem doesn't state that. Hmm.

Wait, but perhaps the setup is that the 12 charges are all at a distance of 2m from P, but their mutual distances are much larger, so that the potential energy between them is negligible compared to the potential energy with the 13th charge. But again, without knowing the mutual distances, it's impossible to confirm.

Alternatively, perhaps the 12 charges are arranged in a way that each is at the same distance from each other as well. But that would require a specific arrangement, like a regular icosahedron around P. But calculating that would be complicated.

Wait, perhaps the problem is only considering the potential energy between the 13th charge and each of the 12, and the mutual potential energy is not part of the calculation. Let's proceed with that and see what answer we get.

So, the potential energy between the 13th and each of the 12 is 2 k e² each. So total is 24 k e².

Wait, but wait. Let's calculate that. Let me plug in the numbers.

First, calculate k, which is Coulomb's constant, approximately 8.988×10^9 N·m²/C².

e is the elementary charge, 1.602×10^-19 C.

So each charge is 2e, so 3.204×10^-19 C.

Wait, but wait: when I compute U for each pair, it's (2e)(2e) =4e². So 4 * (1.602e-19)^2. Divided by (2 m), multiplied by k.

But wait, wait, the formula is U = k*(q1*q2)/r.

So each pair between the 13th and the 12 others is (2e)*(2e) / 2 m = (4e²)/(2) = 2 e².

Multiply by k: 2 k e².

So each of the 12 pairs contributes 2 k e².

So for all 12, it's 12 * 2 k e² = 24 k e².

Now, let's compute that numerically.

k = 8.988e9 N m²/C².

e = 1.602e-19 C.

So e squared is (1.602e-19)^2 = 2.566e-38 C².

So 24 k e² = 24 * 8.988e9 * 2.566e-38.

Let me compute that step by step.

First, 8.988e9 * 2.566e-38 = ?

Let me compute 8.988 * 2.566 ≈ let's see:

8 * 2.566 is about 20.528.

0.988 * 2.566 ≈ approx 2.533.

So total around 23.061, but exact value:

8.988 * 2.566 = let's compute it precisely.

8 * 2.566 = 20.528

0.988 * 2.566 = let's compute:

2.566 * 1 = 2.566

2.566 * 0.988 = 2.566 - (2.566 * 0.012) = 2.566 - 0.030792 = 2.535208.

So total is 20.528 + 2.535208 = 23.063208.

So 8.988e9 * 2.566e-38 = 23.063208e-29 = 2.3063208e-28.

Now multiply by 24:

24 * 2.3063208e-28 = 55.3517e-28 = 5.53517e-27 J.

So approximately 5.535e-27 Joules.

But wait, wait, I think I made a miscalculation. Let me check again.

Wait, no. The calculation is:

Each pair contributes U = k*(2e)^2 / (2 m).

Wait, (2e)^2 =4e².

So U per pair is (k * 4e²) / (2m), which simplifies to (2 k e²) / m? Wait no, no—that's 4e²/(2) = 2e².

Wait, the formula is U = k q1 q2 / r.

So for each pair, q1 and q2 are 2e each, and r is 2 meters.

So U = (8.988e9) * (2e) * (2e) / 2.

Wait, let me compute that in one go.

Compute 8.988e9 * (4e²) / 2.

Which is 8.988e9 * (4e²) / 2 = 8.988e9 * 2e² = 17.976e9 * e².

Wait, but e squared is (1.602e-19)^2 = 2.566e-38 C².

So 17.976e9 * 2.566e-38 = ?

17.976e9 = 1.7976e10.

1.7976e10 * 2.566e-38 = (1.7976 * 2.566) * 1e-28.

1.7976 * 2.566 ≈ approx:

1.7976 * 2 = 3.5952.

1.7976 * 0.566 ≈ let's compute that:

0.5 * 1.7976 = 0.8988.

0.066 *1.7976 ≈ 0.1181.

So total ≈ 0.8988 +0.1181 ≈ 1.0169.

So total is approx 3.5952 +1.0169 ≈ 4.6121.

So 4.6121e-28.

That's per pair. Since there are 12 pairs, total U is 12 *4.6121e-28 =55.345e-28 =5.5345e-27 J.

Wait, but wait, I think I messed up the calculation steps. Let me re-calculate:

Wait, U per pair = (k * (2e) * (2e)) / 2 = (k *4 e²) / 2 = 2 k e².

So U per pair = 2 * 8.988e9 * (1.602e-19)^2.

Compute 8.988e9 * (1.602e-19)^2:

First, compute (1.602e-19)^2 = (1.602)^2 * 1e-38 = 2.566e-38.

So 8.988e9 * 2.566e-38 = 8.988 *2.566e-29 = 22.997e-29 = 2.2997e-28.

Multiply by 2: 2 * 2.2997e-28 = 4.5994e-28 J per pair.

Wait, wait, no, because U per pair is 2 * k * e².

Wait, wait, no, wait. I think I made a mistake in the earlier steps.

Wait, each pair's U is (k * (2e) * (2e)) / 2.

Which is (k *4 e²) / 2 = 2 k e².

So each pair's U is 2 * k * e².

So for each pair, 2 * (8.988e9) * (1.602e-19)^2.

Let me compute that.

First, compute e squared: (1.602e-19)^2 = 2.566e-38.

Then, 8.988e9 * 2.566e-38 = let's compute that.

Multiply 8.988e9 by 2.566e-38:

8.988 * 2.566 ≈ 22.996.

So 22.996e-29 = 2.2996e-28.

Multiply by 2: 4.5992e-28 J per pair.

Multiply by 12 pairs: 4.5992e-28 *12 = 55.1904e-28 = 5.51904e-27 J.

So the potential energy from the 13th charge and the 12 others is approximately 5.519e-27 J.

But wait, that's only considering the 13th and each of the 12. What about the potential energy between each pair of the 12?

If we include that, the total would be higher. But without knowing their mutual distances, I can't calculate it. Therefore, perhaps the problem is only considering the 13th charge's interactions, and the others' mutual interactions are neglected.

Looking at the options, option C is 7.056e-27 J, which is almost exactly double of 5.5e-27. Hmm, maybe the problem is considering all interactions, including the 12 choose 2 pairs.

Wait, let's compute that.

The 12 charges can interact among themselves. Each pair of the 12 is separated by some distance. But without knowing their arrangement, perhaps the problem assumes that each is at a distance of 2 meters from each other as well. But that wouldn't make sense because all 12 can't be at 2m from each other and from P.

Alternatively, perhaps the mutual distance between the 12 charges is 2m. But that would mean each charge is 2m from P and 2m from every other charge. But that's only possible if all 13 charges are at the same point, which can't be the case because only the 13th is fixed at P, and the others are at 2m from P.

Wait, perhaps the mutual distance between any two of the 12 is much larger than 2m, making their potential energy negligible. But that's an assumption not stated in the problem.

Alternatively, perhaps the 12 are arranged in a way that each is at a distance of 2m from P, but their mutual distances are much smaller, making their potential energy significant. But without knowing, it's impossible.

Hmm, perhaps the problem is only considering the potential energy between the 13th charge and the others, and not the others' mutual energy. So the answer would be approximately 5.5e-27 J, but looking at the options, the closest is option C:7.056e-27, which is about 1.27 times larger.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me recompute.

Wait, perhaps the mutual distance between the 12 is 2m from each other as well. But that can't be the case because they are all constrained to be 2m from P. So arranging all 12 at 2m from P and each other is impossible unless they are all at the same point, which they aren't.

Alternatively, perhaps the 12 are arranged such that their mutual distances are 2m as well. But that would require a very tight packing, which is not possible for 12 points on a sphere.

Wait, perhaps the mutual potential is not considered because the problem is only about the energy due to the 13th charge's interactions. So the 5.5e-27 J would be the answer, but none of the options match that.

Wait, looking at the options:

A)5.645e-26

B)2.822e-26

C)7.056e-27

D)122.330

Hmm. So 5.5e-27 is not among the options. So perhaps I made an error in the approach.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the 12 charges are all located at the same point, 2m from P.

Wait, but that would mean that each of the 12 is at the same point, 2m from P. So the distance between any two of the 12 would be zero, which is impossible. So that can't be.

Alternatively, perhaps the 12 are uniformly distributed on a sphere of radius 2m, so their mutual distances are the same. Hmm.

Wait, in a regular icosahedron arrangement on a sphere, the distance between any two adjacent vertices is about 1.618 times the radius. So in this case, the radius is 2m, so the mutual distance would be approximately 3.236 m.

But without exact calculations, perhaps we can approximate the distance as being much larger than 2m, making their mutual potential energy negligible compared to the energy from the 13th charge.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is simplifying and only considering the potential energy between each of the 12 and the 13th charge.

Wait, let me recompute that.

Each pair between 13th and others: U = (k*(2e)^2)/(2m) = (k *4e²)/(2) = 2k e².

Total for 12 pairs: 24 k e².

Which is 24 * 8.988e9 * (1.602e-19)^2.

Wait, let me compute this more accurately.

Compute (1.602e-19)^2 = (1.602)^2=2.566, so 2.566e-38.

Multiply by 8.988e9: 8.988e9 * 2.566e-38 = 8.988 *2.566 = approx 22.996, so 22.996e-29 = 2.2996e-28.

Multiply by 24: 2.2996e-28 * 24 = 55.1904e-28 =5.51904e-27 J.

So that's about 5.519e-27 J.

Looking at the options, option C is 7.056e-27, which is about 1.278 times larger than 5.519e-27.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps I'm forgetting that the 12 charges are each 2e, so the potential energy between each pair is (2e)^2, which is 4e².

Wait, but I think I accounted for that.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula.

Wait, the potential energy for a pair is U = (k q1 q2)/r.

So for each of the 12 pairs with the 13th charge, q1 is 2e, q2 is 2e, r is 2m.

So U per pair is (k * (2e) * (2e)) / (2) = (4 k e²) /2 = 2 k e².

Yes, correct.

So 12 pairs: 24 k e².

Which is 24 * 8.988e9 * (1.602e-19)^2.

Wait, let me compute that again.

Compute (1.602e-19)^2 = 2.566e-38.

Multiply by 8.988e9: 8.988e9 *2.566e-38 = 8.988 *2.566 =22.996, then 22.996e-29 = 2.2996e-28.

Multiply by 24: 2.2996e-28 *24=55.1904e-28=5.51904e-27 J.

So that's about 5.519e-27 J.

But the options don't have that. The closest is option C:7.056e-27 J.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing a factor of 2. Because maybe the potential energy is considering each pair twice?

Wait, no. Because in the sum over all pairs, each pair is considered once. So the 12 pairs with the 13th charge are 12 terms, each (2e)(2e)/(2m) multiplied by k.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the 12 charges are all at the same point, 2m from P, so their mutual distance is zero. But that would imply infinite potential energy, which is not possible. So that's not the case.

Alternatively, perhaps the 12 charges are arranged such that their mutual distances are all 2m from each other. So each of the 12 charges is 2m from P and 2m from every other charge. But that's not possible unless they're all coinciding, which would cause infinite potential energy again.

Hmm. So maybe the problem is only considering the potential energy between the 13th charge and the 12, and not the mutual interactions. Then, the answer would be approximately 5.5e-27 J, but the options don't have that.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me check the numbers again.

k=8.988e9 N·m²/C².

e=1.602e-19 C.

Each charge is 2e, so 3.204e-19 C.

Wait, wait no. 2e is 2 * 1.602e-19 = 3.204e-19 C.

Wait, no. 2e is 2 * 1.602e-19 = 3.204e-19 C. So each charge is 3.204e-19 C.

Wait, so each pair between the 13th and the 12 is (3.204e-19 C) * (3.204e-19 C) / (2 m).

Wait, so U per pair is (8.988e9) * (3.204e-19)^2 / 2.

Wait, let me compute (3.204e-19)^2: 3.204^2=10.265, so 10.265e-38.

So, 8.988e9 * 10.265e-38 = 8.988 *10.265 = approx 92.314, so 92.314e-29 =9.2314e-28.

Divide by 2: 4.6157e-28 J per pair.

Multiply by 12: 4.6157e-28 *12=55.3884e-28=5.53884e-27 J.

Same as before, about 5.54e-27 J.

Hmm. Still not matching any options. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps the 12 charges are all located at the same point, 2m from P. So each of the 12 is at 2m from P, but are all at the same location, so their mutual distance is zero. But that can't be right, as that would cause infinite potential energy between them.

Alternatively, perhaps the 12 charges are located in such a way that each is 2m from P and also 2m from each other. But that's not possible because you can't have more than a few points on a sphere all 2m apart.

Wait, perhaps the problem is only considering the potential energy between the 13th charge and each of the 12, and the mutual energy between the 12 is considered zero. But that's an assumption, but let's see.

If the mutual energy is neglected, the total is 5.54e-27 J, but the options don't have that. So perhaps I'm missing a factor.

Wait, the problem says the system is isolated. So perhaps all interactions are considered, including the 12 charges' mutual interactions.

But without knowing the distances, perhaps the problem is making an assumption that each of the 12 is at a distance of 2m from each other as well. But that would require all 12 to be on a sphere of radius 2m, and each pair separated by 2m. But that's impossible for 12 points; the maximum number of equidistant points on a sphere is 6 (octahedron), perhaps.

So that's not feasible. So perhaps the problem is only considering the potential energy between the 13th charge and the 12, and not their mutual interactions.

Hmm. Given that the options don't include 5.5e-27, perhaps I'm missing something else.

Wait, perhaps the charges are 2e each, so each pair between the 12 contributes (2e)^2/(r) *k. But what is r here?

If they're all on a sphere of radius 2m, the average distance between two points on a sphere can be calculated, but I'm not sure of the exact formula. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering that the mutual distance is also 2m, leading to each pair's potential energy being (k*(2e)^2)/(2) = same as their interactions with the 13th charge.

Wait, but if each of the 12 is at 2m from P, and their mutual distance is 2m, then for each pair among the 12, their U is (k*(2e)^2)/(2) = same as their U with the 13th.

So each pair (12 choose 2) = 66 pairs, each contributing 2 k e².

So, the mutual energy would be 66 * 2 k e² = 132 k e².

Plus the 12 * 2 k e² from the 13th charge and the 12 others: total 144 k e².

So total U = 144 k e².

Calculating that:

144 *8.988e9 * (1.602e-19)^2.

Compute (1.602e-19)^2=2.566e-38.

144 *8.988e9 = 144 *8.988e9 ≈ 144 *9e9 =1.296e12, but more accurately: 8.988e9 *144= 8.988 *144 = let me compute:

8 *144=1152.

0.988 *144= approx 142.  (0.988*144= 142. (0.988 *100=98.8, 0.988*44=43.472 → 98.8+43.472=142.272.)

So total 1152 +142.272=1294.272 → 1294.272e9 = 1.294272e12.

Multiply by 2.566e-38: 1.294272e12 *2.566e-38 = (1.294272 *2.566) e-26.

1.294272 *2.566 ≈ let's compute:

1.294272 *2 =2.588544.

1.294272 *0.566= approximately 0.728.

So total around 3.3165.

So 3.3165e-26 J.

But that's about 3.3e-26, which isn't one of the options either.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering only the mutual potential energy between the 12 charges, not including the 13th. But that seems unlikely.

Wait, what if the mutual distances are all 4 meters? Then the potential energy would be (k*(2e)^2)/(4) = k*(4e²)/(4)=k e². So each pair contributes k e², and 66 pairs would be 66 k e².

Which would be 66 *8.988e9 * (1.602e-19)^2.

So 66 *8.988e9 = 66 *8.988= 593.  593e9.

Multiply by (1.602e-19)^2=2.566e-38.

So 593e9 *2.566e-38 = (593 *2.566) e-29.

593 *2.566 ≈ let's compute:

500 *2.566=1283.

93 *2.566≈  93*2=186, 93*0.566≈52.7 → total 238.7.

Total ≈1283 +238.7=1521.7.

So 1521.7e-29 =1.5217e-26 J.

But that's approximately 1.52e-26 J, which is roughly option B (2.8e-26), but not exactly.

Hmm. This is getting complicated. Maybe I should look for another approach.

Wait, perhaps the problem is assuming that the 12 charges are all at the same point, 2m from P, but that would result in an infinite potential energy due to their mutual repulsion. So that's not possible.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only considering the potential energy of the 12 charges relative to the 13th, and their mutual potential energy is considered zero. But that doesn't make physical sense.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the 12 charges are arranged in a way that their mutual potential energy is zero. But that's impossible for like charges.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the potential energy of the system when it's in a configuration of minimum energy, which might involve considering the mutual repulsion of the 12 charges and arranging them as far apart as possible.

But without knowing their exact arrangement, perhaps the problem is making an assumption that the mutual distances are much larger, so their potential energy is negligible. Thus, the total potential energy is just the sum from the 13th charge and the 12 others.

So that would give U ≈5.5e-27 J, but none of the options match that.

Wait, looking back at the options, option B is 2.822e-26, which is about 5 times larger than 5.5e-27.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the charge value. Because the problem says each charge is 2e. So 2 times e.

Wait, perhaps I should use 2e for each charge, so q=2e.

So, q=2e, so q^2=4e².

So when calculating U for each pair, it's k*(2e)^2 / r = k*4e²/(r).

So, for the 12 interactions with the 13th:

Each U is k*4e²/(2m) = 2 k e².

But perhaps I forgot that each of these 12 charges is also interacting with the 13th, but maybe I'm double-counting? No, because each pair is counted once.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering that the 12 charges are arranged in such a way that their mutual potential energy is the same as their potential energy with the 13th. But that would mean the mutual potential energy is also 5.5e-27 J, making the total U around 1.1e-26 J, which is close to option B (2.8e-26), but not exactly.

Alternatively, perhaps the mutual potential energy is considered zero, which isn't correct.

Wait, perhaps the problem is only considering the potential energy between each of the 12 and the 13th, but the 13th is at P, and the 12 are arranged such that their mutual potential energy is zero. But that's impossible because like charges repel.

Hmm. I'm stuck. Given the options, perhaps the answer is option C, 7.056e-27 J, which is approximately 1.27 times the 5.5e-27 J I calculated earlier.

Wait, perhaps I missed a factor of 2. Let me think again.

Wait, each of the 12 charges is at a distance of 2m from P, and the 13th is at P. So each pair between the 13th and a charge is 2m.

But the 12 charges are identical and each is 2m from P. If they're arranged symmetrically, perhaps the potential energy between each pair of the 12 charges is taken as the same as their potential energy with the 13th, but that's just a wild guess.

Alternatively, perhaps the mutual potential energy between the 12 is calculated as if they're each 2m apart, which would give U = (k*(2e)^2)/(2) = same as before. So each pair contributes 2 k e².

But for 12 charges, the number of such pairs is (12 choose 2) =66.

So 66 *2 k e²=132 k e².

Plus the 12 *2 k e²=24 k e².

Total U =156 k e².

So 156 *8.988e9 * (1.602e-19)^2.

Compute that.

First, 8.988e9 * (1.602e-19)^2 is 8.988e9 *2.566e-38 = 2.299e-28.

Multiply by 156: 2.299e-28 *156=358.284e-28=3.58284e-26 J.

But that's approximately 3.58e-26 J, which isn't an option either.

Wait, perhaps the mutual distance is 4m. Then each pair's U would be (k*(2e)^2)/(4) =k e².

So 66 pairs contribute 66 k e².

And the 12 interactions with the 13th contribute 24 k e².

Total U=90 k e².

Compute 90 *8.988e9 * (1.602e-19)^2.

8.988e9 * (1.602e-19)^2=2.299e-28.

Multiply by 90: 2.299e-28 *90=206.91e-28=2.0691e-26 J.

Still not matching any options.

Hmm.

Given all this confusion, perhaps I should look for another approach.

Wait, the problem is from an exam, so perhaps it's intended to consider only the potential energy between the 13th charge and the 12. So the calculation is 12 * (k*(2e)^2)/(2m).

So, U=12 * (k *4e²)/(2) =12 * 2 k e² =24 k e².

Which is 24 *8.988e9 * (1.602e-19)^2.

Compute that:

(1.602e-19)^2=2.566e-38.

8.988e9 *2.566e-38=2.299e-28.

24 *2.299e-28=5.5176e-27 J.

So approximately 5.518e-27 J.

Looking at the options, option C is 7.056e-27, which is about 1.278 times larger.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me recompute 24 *2.299e-28:

24 *2.299e-28 = (20 *2.299) + (4 *2.299) )e-28.

20 *2.299=45.98.

4 *2.299=9.196.

Total 55.176e-28=5.5176e-27 J.

Hmm. So perhaps the problem includes the mutual potential energy between the 12 charges, but as I can't compute it without more info, perhaps the intended answer is option C, which is 7.056e-27 J.

Wait, wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me compute 24 *2.299e-28 accurately.

24 * 2.299e-28 = ?

24 *2.299 = let's compute:

20 *2.299=45.98

4*2.299=9.196

Total 55.176 → 55.176e-28 =5.5176e-27 J.

Still not matching any option.

Wait, perhaps I'm supposed to calculate the potential energy as 24 * (2e)^2 / (2 m) *k, which is the same as before.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the total potential energy, including both the 13th and the 12's mutual energy, but I'm not seeing how that gives one of the provided options.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering that each of the 12 charges is at a distance of 2m from each other, not from P. But that can't be, as they're all 2m from P.

Hmm, perhaps I should try to see which option matches the calculation.

Wait, option C is 7.056e-27 J.

Let me see what 7.056e-27 would be in terms of k e².

7.056e-27 J = X * k e².

X =7.056e-27 / (8.988e9 * (1.602e-19)^2 ) 

Compute denominator:8.988e9 *2.566e-38 ≈2.299e-28.

So X=7.056e-27 /2.299e-28 ≈30.68.

So 30.68 *k e².

Which would be 30.68 pairs each contributing 2 k e².

Wait, 30.68 pairs would be approximately 30.68. But 12 pairs with the 13th and 66 mutual pairs would be 78 pairs. 78 is much larger than 30.68.

So perhaps the problem is considering only a subset of the interactions, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation earlier, and the correct approach is to simply calculate the potential energy between each of the 12 and the 13th, leading to 5.5e-27 J, which is not an option. Therefore, perhaps the intended answer is option C, 7.056e-27 J, but I'm not fully confident.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the charge as 2e, but I'm using 2e as 2*1.6e-19, but perhaps it's considering 2e as 2*1.6e-19 C, which is correct.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering the mutual distances as 4 meters, so each pair among the 12 contributes (k*(2e)^2)/4 =k e².

So each mutual pair contributes k e².

Number of mutual pairs:66.

So 66 *k e²=66 *8.988e9 * (1.602e-19)^2.

Compute that:66 * 2.299e-28 = 151.734e-28=1.51734e-26 J.

Plus the 12 * 2 k e²=24 *2.299e-28=5.5176e-27 J.

Total U=1.51734e-26 +5.5176e-27=2.069e-26 J.

Still, not matching any options.

Hmm. Maybe the problem is only considering the potential energy between the 13th charge and each of the 12, and not the mutual interactions. So the answer would be 5.5e-27 J, but since that's not an option, perhaps the intended answer is option C, which is about twice that.

Wait, option C is 7.056e-27 J.

Wait, perhaps I missed a factor of 2 in the calculation. Let me think again.

Each pair between the 13th and the 12 contributes 2 k e².

But perhaps each of the 12 charges is also contributing to the potential energy with the 13th, which I've considered. So total 12 *2 k e²=24 k e².

But perhaps the problem is also considering that the 13th charge has a potential energy with itself, which is not the case.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering each of the 12 charges as fixed at 2m from P, and the 13th is free to move. But no, the 13th is fixed.

Wait, perhaps the problem is asking for the potential energy of the system when the 13th charge is fixed, and the 12 are each 2m away, but their mutual distances are zero. But that can't be.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only considering the potential energy between the 13th charge and each of the 12, and the mutual potential energy is considered zero. But that's not correct.

Hmm. I think I've exhausted all possibilities. Given that, perhaps the intended answer is option C, 7.056e-27 J, which is approximately 1.278 times the 5.5e-27 J I calculated earlier. But I'm not sure why.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the number of pairs. Let me double-check.

The problem is about the potential energy of the system, which is the sum over all pairs.

The 13th charge interacts with 12 others: 12 pairs.

The 12 charges interact among themselves: (12 choose 2) =66 pairs.

So total pairs:78.

But the problem says the charges are identical. So each pair contributes (k*(2e)^2)/r.

But without knowing r for the mutual pairs, perhaps the problem is assuming that the mutual distance is 2m, so each mutual pair contributes 2 k e².

Thus, total U= (12 +66) *2 k e²=78*2 k e²=156 k e².

Which is 156 *8.988e9 * (1.602e-19)^2.

Compute that:

8.988e9 *2.566e-38=2.299e-28.

Multiply by 156:2.299e-28 *156=358.284e-28=3.58284e-26 J.

Still not matching any options.

Hmm. At this point, perhaps I should look for the option that matches the calculation when only the 13th's interactions are considered, which is option C:7.056e-27 J.

Wait, perhaps I should recompute the calculation with the exact numbers.

Compute 24 * k *e².

k=8.988e9.

e=1.602e-19.

So 24 *8.988e9 * (1.602e-19)^2.

Calculate (1.602e-19)^2:

1.602^2 =2.566, so 2.566e-38.

8.988e9 *2.566e-38=8.988 *2.566=22.996, so 22.996e-29=2.2996e-28.

Multiply by 24:2.2996e-28 *24=55.1904e-28=5.51904e-27 J.

So that's about 5.519e-27 J. None of the options match this.

Looking at the options:

A)5.645e-26 → 56.45e-26 → no.

B)2.822e-26 → 28.22e-26 → no.

C)7.056e-27 →7.056e-27 → about 1.278 times 5.5e-27.

D)122.330 → way larger, probably in J, but 122 J is way too big for this scenario.

Hmm. So none of the options match, except perhaps option C is a typo and should be 5.519e-27. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the number of pairs.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering that each of the 12 charges is at a distance of 1m from P, but the problem states 2m.

Wait, the problem says each of the 12 is 2m from P. So that's correct.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering that each of the 12 charges is at a distance of 2m from each other, not from P. But that would require a different setup.

I'm stuck. Given the options, perhaps the intended answer is option C:7.056e-27 J, but I'm not certain.


The problem involves calculating the minimum potential energy of a system of 13 identical charges, each with charge \( 2e \), where 12 of the charges are constrained to stay at a distance of 2 meters from a point \( P \), and the 13th charge is fixed at \( P \). The potential energy of the system is determined by summing the contributions from all pairs of charges.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Potential Energy Formula**: The potential energy between two point charges is given by:
   \[
   U = \frac{k \cdot q_1 \cdot q_2}{r}
   \]
   where \( k = 8.988 \times 10^9 \, \text{N·m}^2/\text{C}^2 \), \( q_1 \) and \( q_2 \) are the charges, and \( r \) is the distance between them.

2. **Charges and Distances**:
   - Each charge is \( 2e \), where \( e = 1.602 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{C} \), so \( q = 3.204 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{C} \).
   - The 12 charges are each at a distance of 2 meters from \( P \), where the 13th charge is fixed.

3. **Interactions**:
   - The 13th charge interacts with each of the 12 charges, contributing \( 12 \) pairs.
   - The 12 charges also interact with each other, contributing \( \binom{12}{2} = 66 \) pairs.
   - The total number of pairs is \( 12 + 66 = 78 \).

4. **Potential Energy Contributions**:
   - For interactions between the 13th charge and the 12 charges:
     \[
     U_{\text{13th-12}} = 12 \cdot \frac{k \cdot (2e)^2}{2} = 12 \cdot \frac{k \cdot 4e^2}{2} = 24 \cdot k \cdot e^2
     \]
   - For interactions between the 12 charges:
     \[
     U_{\text{12-12}} = 66 \cdot \frac{k \cdot (2e)^2}{r_{\text{mutual}}}
     \]
     However, the mutual distance \( r_{\text{mutual}} \) is not explicitly provided. If \( r_{\text{mutual}} = 2 \, \text{m} \), then:
     \[
     U_{\text{12-12}} = 66 \cdot \frac{k \cdot 4e^2}{2} = 132 \cdot k \cdot e^2
     \]
   - Total potential energy:
     \[
     U_{\text{total}} = U_{\text{13th-12}} + U_{\text{12-12}} = 24 \cdot k \cdot e^2 + 132 \cdot k \cdot e^2 = 156 \cdot k \cdot e^2
     \]

5. **Numerical Calculation**:
   - \( e^2 = (1.602 \times 10^{-19})^2 = 2.566 \times 10^{-38} \, \text{C}^2 \).
   - \( k \cdot e^2 = 8.988 \times 10^9 \cdot 2.566 \times 10^{-38} = 2.299 \times 10^{-28} \, \text{J} \).
   - \( U_{\text{total}} = 156 \cdot 2.299 \times 10^{-28} = 3.582 \times 10^{-26} \, \text{J} \).

6. **Comparison with Options**:
   - The calculated value \( 3.582 \times 10^{-26} \, \text{J} \) does not match any of the provided options.
   - If only the interactions between the 13th charge and the 12 charges are considered:
     \[
     U_{\text{13th-12}} = 24 \cdot k \cdot e^2 = 24 \cdot 2.299 \times 10^{-28} = 5.519 \times 10^{-27} \, \text{J}
     \]
     This value also does not match any of the options.
   - The closest option is \( 7.056 \times 10^{-27} \, \text{J} \), which is approximately \( 1.278 \times 5.519 \times 10^{-27} \). This discrepancy may arise from an implicit assumption in the problem setup or rounding differences.

### Conclusion:
Given the provided options and the analysis, the most reasonable choice is **C) \( 7.056 \times 10^{-27} \, \text{J} \)**, though the exact reasoning for the discrepancy remains unclear.

**Answer: C**
