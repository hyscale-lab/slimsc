Okay, so I'm trying to figure out which planet has a higher probability of transiting so the researchers should observe that one. Let's see what information I have.

Both planets are Earth-like and detected via the RV method. They share the same minimum masses, but their orbital periods are different. Planet_1 has a shorter period—three times shorter than Planet_2. So if Planet_2's period is, say, P, Planet_1's is P/3.

The host stars: Planet_1's star is twice as massive as Planet_2's. But both stars have the same radius. Interesting. That's probably because Planet_2's star is slightly evolved, but their radii are the same.

Transit probability depends on a few factors. I remember that the probability is related to the size of the planet compared to the star and the alignment of the orbit. The formula for transit probability is roughly (R_planet / R_star)^2 multiplied by something else... Wait, no, the main factor is the ratio of the planet's orbital distance to the star's radius. Or wait, the probability is proportional to (R_planet / R_star)^2 times (1 / (1 + (M_star / M_planet)^(1/3))) or something like that. Hmm, maybe I'm mixing it up.

Wait, another approach. The transit probability is higher when the orbital plane is edge-on relative to us. The probability is approximately (R_planet / R_star)^2 times (a / (a * (1 - e^2)^0.5))—but since the orbits are circular, e=0, so that's just (R_p / R_s)^2 multiplied by (1/(a)), wait no, that doesn't sound right.

Wait, no, the actual formula for the transit probability is P = (R_p + R_s) / a, but wait, no. Let me think again. The transit probability is the ratio of the size of the star and planet to the orbital distance, but I might be getting this wrong.

Wait, the transit probability for a planet is given by the formula: P ≈ (R_p / R_s)^2 * (sin i)^2, but since we don't know the inclination, but for a random distribution, sin i is 1/(sqrt(2)), so the probability is (R_p^2 / R_s^2) * (1/2). But wait, that can't be right because the probability isn't just about the size ratio; it's also about
