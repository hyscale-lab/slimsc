Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me read through it again.

The question involves a series of reactions starting with 1,3-dibromoadamantane. First, it's heated with excess KOH, creating a light yellow solid product 1. Then, product 1 is heated with excess aluminum isopropoxide to form product 2. After that, ozone is bubbled through a solution of product 2 at -78°C, followed by adding dimethylsulfide to get product 3. The question is about the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen atom in product 3's 1H NMR spectrum.

Hmm. Let's break this down reaction by reaction.

Starting with 1,3-dibromoadamantane. I know that adamantane has a diamondoid structure, which is quite rigid. The molecule has four bridgehead carbons, each connected to other bridgehead carbons. 1,3-dibromoadamantane would have bromine atoms on carbons 1 and 3.

Heating with KOH in excess. KOH is a strong base. When vicinal dihalides (two halogens on adjacent carbons) react with a strong base, they often undergo an elimination reaction, like an E2 mechanism, forming alkenes. But wait, in this case, the positions are 1 and 3 on the adamantane. Are they adjacent? Let me think. Adamantane's structure is such that the 1 and 3 positions are not adjacent. Oh, right, in the adamantane structure, the positions are arranged in a way that 1,3 are across each other, not adjacent. So maybe the reaction isn't elimination but something else.

Wait, another possibility is dehydrohalogenation to form an epoxide? No, that's when you have adjacent halogens. Hmm. Or perhaps it's an elimination to form a double bond, but if the dihalide isn't vicinal, maybe it's a different process.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think about the product's NMR data. The 1H NMR shows 4.79 ppm as a 2H triplet. That region is typically around where you see methylene groups attached to oxygen, like in ethers or esters. Wait, 4.79 is more like a CH2O group, maybe an epoxide. But wait, in an epoxide, the protons are usually around 3.5-4.5 ppm, but that's a rough range. Alternatively, maybe it's a ketone or something else.

Wait, looking at the IR spectrum, there's a peak at 1720 cm-1. That's indicative of a carbonyl group, like a ketone or an ester. So maybe product 1 is a ketone. How would that form from 1,3-dibromoadamantane and KOH?

Wait, wait, another reaction comes to mind: the formation of a carbonyl via a double dehydrohalogenation, but that requires adjacent halogens. Oh, but perhaps it's a Hofmann elimination or something else. Or maybe the base abstracts a beta hydrogen, leading to the formation of a carbonyl.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is dehydrohalogenation to form a bridgehead double bond, but I'm not too sure. Let me think again.

Wait, another possibility is that KOH in a high temperature deprotonates, and the two bromides leave, leading to formation of a carbonyl. No, wait, that's not quite right. Alternatively, maybe it's a Fittig reaction? No, that's for coupling aryl halides with metals. Hmm, not applicable here.

Wait, maybe it's a nucleophilic substitution. But with two bromides, perhaps elimination is more likely. Wait, if the two bromide groups are on carbons that are adjacent (but in adamantane, they're not), but perhaps in the structure, they are positioned such that elimination can form a bridge leading to a carbonyl.

Wait, perhaps this is a case of dehydrohalogenation forming an enol, which then tautomerizes to a ketone. But I'm not exactly sure.

Alternatively, maybe the base causes the two bromides to leave, forming a cyclopropane ring or something else, but that doesn't align with the data.

Wait, perhaps it's a case of a double elimination, forming a ketone. Let me think. If 1,3-dibromoadamantane loses two equivalents of HBr, perhaps the structure forms a ketone in the center. So product 1 would be 1,3-adamantanedione? Or perhaps just a single ketone.

Wait, but wait, the NMR data for product 1 has a triplet at 4.79 ppm (2H) and other signals. Also, the IR has a 1720 cm-1, which is a strong carbonyl. So maybe product 1 is a cyclic ketone.

Wait, another thought: when two bromides are adjacent, they can eliminate to form a double bond. But in this case, the bromides are on 1 and 3, which are not adjacent. So maybe it's a ring-opening reaction. Or perhaps the base leads to a elimination that forms an epoxide, but that doesn't fit the IR data.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me consider the possibility that the reaction is a dehydrohalogenation to form a bridgehead carbonyl. So if the two bromides are on carbons that are beta to each other, then elimination could form a carbonyl.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a case of base-induced elimination to form a cyclopropane ring, but I don't think that's right.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a double dehydrohalogenation, which would require two adjacent Br atoms. Since 1 and 3 are not adjacent, that might not be possible. Wait, but maybe in the adamantane structure, the 1 and 3 positions are arranged such that elimination would form a bridge.

Alternatively, perhaps the base causes the two Br atoms to leave, and the structure forms a ketone through some kind of ring contraction or expansion.

Wait, I'm getting stuck. Maybe I should think about the NMR data again. The triplet at 4.79 ppm (2H) could be a methylene group (CH2) next to an oxygen. So maybe it's a geminal diol? Or an ether.

Wait, but the IR has a strong peak at 1720, which suggests a carbonyl. So product 1 is a ketone. So how does 1,3-dibromoadamantane produce a ketone upon treatment with KOH?

Ah! Maybe it's a case of the Hell–Volhard–Zelinskii reaction, but that's for introducing bromine into carboxylic acids. Not applicable here.

Wait, another possibility: elimination of two equivalents of HBr, forming a double bond, but that would require adjacent Brs, which they are not. But perhaps the base can abstract a proton that's beta to the Br, leading to a double bond, but since the Brs are on 1 and 3, the resulting double bond would be between 1 and 2 or 2 and 3? Hmm, not sure.

Wait, another approach: maybe the reaction forms a ketone via a ring-opening. For instance, if 1,3-dibromoadamantane is treated with a strong base, perhaps the base extracts a proton adjacent to a Br, leading to the formation of a carbanion, which then leads to the expulsion of Br- and the formation of a carbonyl group.

Wait, maybe each Br is on a carbon that's next to a bridgehead. So when KOH is added, each Br leaves, and the two adjacent carbons form a carbonyl group.

Wait, perhaps it's a double elimination, each Br leaving with a proton, forming a carbonyl between the two bridgeheads. So product 1 would be 1,3-diketone adamantane? But the NMR data shows a triplet at 4.79 ppm, which doesn't align with a ketone's protons. Because ketones don't have protons attached; wait, that's a good point. So maybe the 4.79 triplet isn't a ketone's proton. So perhaps the initial analysis is wrong.

Wait, back to product 1's data: 1H NMR: 4.79 (2H, triplet), 2.41-2.23 (10H, multiplet?), 1.94 (2H, triplet). The triplet at 4.79 could be a CH2 next to an oxygen, such as in an epoxide or an ether.

Wait, but then what's the IR peak? 1720 is a carbonyl. Hmm. So perhaps product 1 is an epoxide and a ketone? That doesn't seem likely. Or maybe the 1720 cm-1 is due to an ester or a ketone elsewhere.

Wait, perhaps the product is a diol. But a diol wouldn't have a carbonyl peak.

Wait, maybe product 1 is a cyclic ether, like an epoxide, but then where is the carbonyl?

Alternatively, perhaps the initial reaction forms a ketone and an epoxide. But that seems unlikely.

Wait, perhaps product 1 is a ketone and the 4.79 ppm is a neighboring group. Wait, but I'm not getting anywhere. Maybe I should think about the next step.

Product 1 is heated with excess aluminum isopropoxide to form product 2. Aluminum isopropoxide is a strong Lewis acid, often used in Friedel-Crafts alkylation or acylation. But since product 1 is a ketone, perhaps it undergoes some kind of acylation. Wait, but product 2 is the result of heating with Al isopropoxide, which is a catalyst for such reactions. Alternatively, maybe product 1 is an ester, which would make sense if we're doing something else, but earlier I thought product 1 was a ketone.

Wait, maybe product 1 isn't a ketone. Let me think again. The IR peak at 1720 could be an ester or a ketone. If product 1 is an ester, that would make sense for a subsequent Friedel-Crafts acylation.

But how would 1,3-dibromoadamantane form an ester with KOH? Not sure. Wait, perhaps the initial reaction isn't elimination but a nucleophilic substitution. But with two bromides, perhaps it's a double substitution.

Wait, maybe the KOH is causing each Br to be replaced by an -O- group. So 1,3-dibromoadamantane reacting with KOH would form a diepoxide? Or a diether?

Wait, if each Br is replaced by an -OH, then heating with KOH would lead to an elimination, perhaps forming an epoxide. But wait, with two Brs, maybe each substitution occurs, leading to two hydroxyl groups. But in that case, the product would be 1,3-diol adamantane. But then, where does the 4.79 triplet come from?

Wait, perhaps 1,3-diol could undergo some kind of cyclization. Alternatively, maybe the product is a cyclic ether. For example, if the diol eliminates water to form an epoxide. But then, why the triplet at 4.79?

Alternatively, maybe the product is an ether, but I'm not seeing it.

Hmm, perhaps I should think about the product 1's NMR again. The triplet at 4.79 (2H) suggests a CH2 group next to something that splits the signal into a triplet. The coupling would come from neighboring protons. So perhaps the CH2 is between two groups. With a triplet, each proton is coupling with two equivalent protons. So maybe the CH2 is adjacent to a CH2 group, but that's not the case. Alternatively, perhaps it's a CH2 connected to an oxygen, like OCH2CH2O, but that would be a more complex splitting.

Wait, the triplet at 4.79 could be an ABX system, but that's getting too complicated.

Wait, another approach: maybe the initial reaction forms a ketone. So product 1 is a ketone. Then, when product 1 is heated with aluminum isopropoxide, perhaps it acts as a catalyst for some kind of acylation. Wait, but product 2 is then treated with ozone, so perhaps product 2 is an alkene.

Wait, product 2 is made by heating product 1 with excess aluminum isopropoxide. Aluminum isopropoxide is used in the Friedel-Crafts acylation, which requires an acyl chloride. But if product 1 is a ketone, perhaps it undergoes some kind of reaction. Alternatively, maybe product 1 is an ester, which upon treatment with Al isopropoxide could form an acylium ion, leading to some reaction.

Wait, perhaps product 1 is a diethyl ether derivative, but that's unclear.

Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is 1,3-dibromo to something else. Wait, I'm getting stuck. Maybe I should think about the ozonolysis step.

Product 2 undergoes ozonolysis at -78°C, followed by dimethyl sulfide. Ozonolysis usually cleaves double bonds to form carbonyl groups. So product 2 must have a double bond.

So if product 2 is an alkene, then product 3 would be the ozonolysis products, which are carbonyl compounds. The question is about the NMR of product 3, specifically the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen.

But wait, the NMR data is for product 3. So product 3 is from ozonolysis of product 2, which is from product 1 reacted with Al isopropoxide.

Wait, let me summarize the steps:

1) 1,3-dibromoadamantane + KOH → product 1 (light yellow solid)
2) product 1 + Al isopropoxide → product 2
3) product 2 + ozone → product 3 (after workup)

Product 3's NMR is the focus.

So let's think about each step again.

Step 1: 1,3-dibromoadamantane with KOH. The possible products are either elimination products (double bond) or substitution products (diols or ethers). The IR peak suggests a carbonyl, so perhaps elimination to form a ketone.

Wait, maybe the reaction is a double dehydrohalogenation, but the positions are 1 and 3. So perhaps it's not adjacent, but the elimination forms a bridge, leading to a ketone.

Alternatively, maybe it's a case of the base removing two HBr molecules, leading to a conjugated diene. But I'm not sure how that would form a carbonyl.

Wait, perhaps the product is a cyclopropane ring. But I don't see the connection.

Alternatively, perhaps each Br is replaced by an OH group, leading to 1,3-diol adamantane. But then, how does that lead to the IR peak? 1,3-diol would have hydroxyl groups, but the IR peak is at 1720, which is more like a carbonyl.

Wait, maybe the product is an epoxide. Epoxides have oxygen and would have a peak around 1720? No, epoxides don't have a carbonyl; their IR peak is around 1250-1100 cm-1 for the C-O-C stretch. So that's not matching.

Back to the initial step. Maybe the product is a ketone. Let's say product 1 is a ketone. Then, product 2 is made by heating product 1 with Al isopropoxide. Al isopropoxide is used in the Friedel-Crafts acylation. So perhaps product 1 is an acyl chloride, but that's not the case because KOH wouldn't produce that. Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is an ester, which can form an acylium ion in presence of Al isopropoxide.

Wait, perhaps product 1 is a diethyl ketone or something that can form an acylium ion. Then, product 2 would be an alkylated product, perhaps an aromatic compound, but adamantane is already a polycyclic structure.

Wait, perhaps product 1 is an ester. How? If 1,3-dibromoadamantane reacts with KOH, maybe it's a nucleophilic substitution where each Br is replaced by an O- group, leading to a diepoxide or something else.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a nucleophilic substitution where each Br is replaced by a hydroxide group, leading to diol, but that doesn't explain the IR.

Hmm, perhaps I'm stuck. Let me try to think about product 1's NMR.

The triplet at 4.79 (2H) could be a CH2 group. The 2.41-2.23 region (10H) suggests some bridgehead protons, perhaps in an adamantane structure. The 1.94 (2H) triplet could be another CH2 group.

Wait, if product 1 is an epoxide, then the 4.79 triplet would be the two protons on the epoxide ring. Epoxide protons are typically split into a triplet due to coupling with adjacent CH2 groups. But in an epoxide, each proton is adjacent to two equivalent protons (the other oxygen's CH2?), wait, no, in an epoxide, each CH2 group is connected to the oxygen. So the protons on the epoxide would typically be a triplet due to coupling with the two adjacent protons. So that fits the triplet at 4.79 ppm.

Wait, but then why is there a carbonyl in the IR? Unless the epoxide is part of a larger structure with a ketone elsewhere.

Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is an epoxide and a ketone. But that seems unlikely.

Wait, but maybe product 1 is a cyclic ether, like a bridgehead epoxide. If the 4.79 triplet is the bridgehead epoxide's protons, that would make sense. But then where is the carbonyl peak? Unless there's another functional group.

Alternatively, maybe the IR peak is from something else, like an ester, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the product is a diethyl ether derivative, but that doesn't seem to fit with the initial reaction.

Alternatively, perhaps the initial reaction is forming a ketone via a different mechanism. Maybe the two bromides are on carbons that are adjacent, but in the adamantane structure, they're not. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a ring expansion. For example, in adamantane, losing two Brs and forming a larger ring with a ketone. But I'm not familiar with such a reaction.

Alternatively, maybe the base induces a coupling reaction, forming a new bond between the two bridgeheads, leading to a carbonyl group.

Wait, maybe the reaction is a case of the Robinson annulation, but that's for enones and involves conjugate addition. Not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the initial product is an enol ether, but that doesn't align with the IR.

Hmm. I'm not making much progress on product 1. Maybe I should consider what product 2 is. Since product 1 is treated with Al isopropoxide, which is a Lewis acid, product 2 might be an acylium ion or something that can form an acylium.

Wait, perhaps product 1 is an ester. For example, if product 1 is an ester like R-O-CO-R', then heating with Al isopropoxide would activate it for Friedel-Crafts acylation. But what would the acylation be for? Since adamantane is already a cage structure, perhaps it's adding an acyl group onto an adamantane ring.

Wait, but adamantane is a polycyclic structure, so Friedel-Crafts would require an aromatic ring, which adamantane doesn't have. So maybe product 1 is an acyl chloride, and the reaction forms an acylium ion, which then reacts with something else, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is a ketone, and product 2 is an enol ether, but I don't see how that would happen.

Hmm. Maybe I should think about product 2's structure, since it undergoes ozonolysis. Ozonolysis cleaves double bonds to form carbonyl groups. So product 2 must have a double bond.

If product 2 is an alkene, then product 3 would have carbonyl groups where the double bond was. So product 3 would likely be a diol or diketone, depending on the structure of product 2.

But to find the coupling pattern in product 3, I need to know the structure of product 2's double bond. Since ozonolysis breaks the double bond, the positions of the substituents around the double bond will determine the NMR signals of product 3.

Wait, let's imagine that product 2 is an alkene. Ozonolysis would break it into two carbonyl groups. For example, if product 2 is 1,3-adamantadiene, ozonolysis would cleave it into two carbonyl groups, perhaps forming two ketones or something else.

But without knowing the exact structure, it's hard to proceed. Maybe I should think about the possible structures based on the previous steps.

So, initial step: 1,3-dibromoadamantane + KOH → product 1 (light yellow solid). Product 1's NMR shows a triplet at 4.79 (2H), which I thought might be an epoxide. Then, product 1 is heated with Al isopropoxide to form product 2, which is then ozonolyzed.

If product 1 is an epoxide, perhaps heating with Al isopropoxide would cause some kind of ring-opening, maybe forming an alkene. Alternatively, perhaps the epoxide is converted into an ether, but that doesn't directly form a double bond.

Wait, another thought: if product 1 is a diepoxide (unlikely, since only two Brs), but perhaps it's a monoepoxide, and then in the next step, it's converted into a diene.

Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is an ester, and product 2 is an acetylenic compound, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps product 1 is a diol, and then product 2 is an ether. But then, ozonolysis wouldn't apply, as ethers don't have double bonds.

Alternatively, maybe product 1 is a ketone, and product 2 is an enol ether, which upon ozonolysis would form something else. But I'm not certain.

Hmm, I'm stuck. Maybe I should look for another approach. Let's think about the NMR of product 3. The question is about the most deshielded hydrogen. Deshielded protons are typically those near electronegative groups or in regions of low shielding, like near carbonyl groups.

In ozonolysis, the most deshielded protons might be adjacent to carbonyl groups. So, in product 3, perhaps there are protons next to ketones or esters.

The coupling pattern is determined by neighboring protons. So, the most deshielded proton in product 3 (maybe on a carbonyl group) would have neighboring protons that split its signal.

Wait, but if the proton is on a carbonyl group, it's probably not there because carbonyl groups don't have protons. So perhaps the deshielded proton is on a CH group next to a carbonyl.

For instance, if the ozonolysis produces a diketone, then the adjacent CH2 groups would have protons that are deshielded. The coupling would depend on the neighboring groups.

Wait, for example, suppose product 2 is a substituted cyclopropane with a double bond. Ozonolysis would break the double bond into two carbonyls. The resulting product 3 would have two carbonyl groups, and any adjacent CH2 groups would have their protons split by neighboring protons.

Alternatively, maybe it's a simple diene that upon ozonolysis forms two aldehyde groups. The aldehyde protons are deshielded but are usually split only by adjacent protons.

Wait, but the question is about the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen. So perhaps in product 3, there is a CH2 group adjacent to a carbonyl group.

If the CH2 is between two carbonyl groups, each H would couple with the other, but that might lead to a triplet or something else.

Wait, another scenario: product 3 has a structure like (CH2)2(C=O). So the two CH2 groups adjacent to the carbonyl would each have two protons. The protons on the middle CH2 would be adjacent to both carbonyls and perhaps other CH2 groups.

Wait, for example, if product 3 has a structure like O=C-CH2-CH2-CO, then the central CH2 groups would have protons that are next to each other, leading to a coupling pattern. Each proton on the central CH2 would couple with the two protons on the adjacent CH2, leading to a triplet of triplets or similar.

Alternatively, if the structure is O=C-CH2-CH2-CH2-CO, the middle CH2 would couple with both adjacent CH2 groups, leading to a more complex splitting.

Wait, but if the most deshielded proton is on a CH2 adjacent to a carbonyl, and the CH2 is between two other CH2 groups, each with two protons, then each H would have neighboring Hs from both adjacent groups.

Let me think about the splitting. For a proton that is adjacent to two different sets of neighboring protons, the coupling could be a doublet of doublets, or a triplet of triplets, depending on the number of neighboring protons.

Alternatively, if a proton is next to a CH2 group (two Hs) and another CH2 group (two Hs), the splitting would be more complex. For example, each H in the central CH2 would be split by the two Hs on each adjacent CH2. So each H would have (n+1)(m+1) where n and m are the number of neighboring Hs. So if each side has two Hs, the splitting would be (2+1)*(2+1) = 9 peaks, which is a nonet. But that's not one of the options.

Wait, but looking at the options, the choices are triplet, triplet of triplets, doublet of triplets, or pentet.

Alternatively, perhaps the most deshielded H is part of a CH group adjacent to a carbonyl. For example, a CH2 group next to a carbonyl and another CH2 group. Let's say the structure is O=C-CH2-CH2-CH2-CO.

In such a case, the middle CH2 (CH2-CH2) would have each H coupling with the two Hs on each adjacent CH2. So each H in the middle CH2 would be split by the neighboring CH2 groups.

Wait, but each H in the middle would be coupling with two different sets of two Hs. So the splitting would be a triplet of triplets, because each side contributes a triplet.

Wait, for a proton that is adjacent to two different CH2 groups (each with two Hs), the splitting would be (n+1)(m+1) = (2+1)(2+1) = 9, which is a nonet. But that's not an option. So perhaps I'm not considering the correct structure.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure has a CH group next to a carbonyl. For example, O=C-CH2-CH(CH3)-CO. But then the splitting would depend on the neighboring groups.

Wait, another approach: if the ozonolysis produces two aldehyde groups, the product would be something like OHC-(CH2)n-CHO. The protons on the CH2 groups in the middle would have neighboring protons on both sides, leading to a coupling pattern.

For example, in OHC-CH2-CH2-CHO, the central CH2-CH2 would each have their protons split by the adjacent CH2 groups. Each H in the middle would see two Hs from one side and two Hs from the other, leading to a triplet of triplets.

Wait, but the options have triplet of triplets as option B. Alternatively, maybe it's a doublet of triplets.

Wait, another possibility: if the structure is OHC-CH2-CH2-CH2-CHO, the middle CH2 would have Hs that are adjacent to two Hs on each side. So each H would couple with two Hs on each adjacent CH2, leading to a triplet of triplets.

But perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think about the options. The options are:

A) triplet

B) triplet of triplets

C) doublet of triplets

D) pentet

If the most deshielded H is in a CH2 group next to a carbonyl, and each H is next to two Hs on either side, then each H would see four neighboring Hs, but that would result in a pentet (n=4 → 5 peaks). But that's option D, which is a pentet.

Alternatively, if each H is next to two Hs on one side and two on the other, the splitting would be (2+1)(2+1)=9, which is a nonet, but that's not an option.

Wait, perhaps the splitting is only from one side. For example, if the H is adjacent to a CH2 group on one side and a CH group on the other. Let's say the structure is OHC-CH2-CH(CH3)-CHO. Then, the CH2 group would have Hs that are next to the CH(CH3) group.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the H is adjacent to only one set of neighboring Hs, leading to a triplet.

Wait, let's think about the scenario where product 3 has a CH2 group adjacent to a carbonyl group and another CH2 group. For example, the structure is O=C-CH2-CH2-CH2-CO. The middle CH2 would have each H adjacent to two Hs from one side and two from the other, leading to a triplet of triplets.

But wait, if each H sees two Hs on each adjacent CH2, then n=2 for each side, leading to (2+1)*(2+1)=9, which is a nonet. But that's not an option, so I must be wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is O=C-CH2-CH2-CO, where the middle CH2 is between two carbonyls. Each H in the middle CH2 would be adjacent to two Hs on one side and two on the other, leading to (2+1)(2+1)=9, but again, not an option.

Hmm. Maybe the correct structure is OHC-CH2-CH2-CHO. In this case, the middle CH2 would have each H adjacent to two Hs on each side, leading to a triplet of triplets. So each H would be split by two Hs on the left and two on the right, leading to a triplet from each coupling. So the overall splitting would be a triplet of triplets, which is option B.

Alternatively, perhaps the splitting is only from one adjacent CH2 group, leading to a triplet. So the answer would be option A.

But I'm not entirely sure. Let me think again.

Wait, in the structure OHC-CH2-CH2-CHO, each central CH2 is next to a CH2 group on both sides. Each H in the central CH2 would couple with the two Hs on the left and the two on the right. That would lead to each H having (2+1)*(2+1) = 9 peaks, which is a nonet. But that's not an option. So perhaps the actual structure is different.

Another possibility: the ozonolysis produces a diketone, such as O=C-R-CO. If R is a CH2 group, then the structure would be O=C-CH2-CO. But then the CH2 would have each H adjacent to the CO groups. Wait, but that would just be a single CH2 between two CO groups. Each H in the CH2 would be adjacent to two Hs on the same group, but that's a CH2, so each H is next to two Hs. Wait, no, in a CH2 group, each H is next to one H on the same group. Wait, no, in a CH2 group, each H is adjacent to only one H (the other in the same CH2), but in a larger chain, maybe it's different.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is O=C-CH2-CH2-CO, which is a four-carbon chain with two carbonyls. The middle CH2 groups would each have two Hs. Each H in the middle would be adjacent to two Hs on one side and two on the other, leading to a triplet of triplets.

But without seeing the actual structure, it's hard to be certain. Given the options, I think the most likely answer is a triplet of triplets, which is option B.


The problem involves a series of reactions starting with 1,3-dibromoadamantane, leading to a final product (product 3) whose most deshielded hydrogen's coupling pattern is to be determined. Here's the analysis:

1. **Reaction 1: 1,3-dibromoadamantane + KOH → Product 1**  
   - The IR spectrum of product 1 shows a strong absorbance at 1720 cm⁻¹, indicative of a carbonyl group.  
   - The ¹H NMR spectrum of product 1 includes a triplet at 4.79 ppm (2H), which suggests a CH₂ group adjacent to an electronegative group, such as oxygen.  
   - Based on the data, product 1 is likely a ketone or an ether derivative. However, the IR peak at 1720 cm⁻¹ strongly supports the presence of a carbonyl group, making a ketone the most plausible structure.

2. **Reaction 2: Product 1 + Al isopropoxide → Product 2**  
   - Aluminum isopropoxide is a Lewis acid, often used in Friedel-Crafts acylation.  
   - Since product 1 is a ketone, it is likely converted into an acylium ion, forming an alkene (product 2).  
   - Product 2 is expected to contain a double bond, as ozonolysis in the next step cleaves double bonds.

3. **Reaction 3: Product 2 + Ozonolysis → Product 3**  
   - Ozonolysis cleaves double bonds to form carbonyl groups.  
   - If product 2 is an alkene, product 3 will contain carbonyl groups (e.g., ketones or aldehydes) at the cleavage sites.  
   - The most deshielded hydrogen in product 3 is likely adjacent to a carbonyl group, such as in a CH₂ group next to a carbonyl.

4. **Coupling Pattern of the Most Deshielded Hydrogen in Product 3**  
   - The most deshielded hydrogen is in a CH₂ group adjacent to a carbonyl group.  
   - This CH₂ group is flanked by two other CH₂ groups, each with two hydrogens.  
   - Each hydrogen in the central CH₂ group couples with the two hydrogens on each adjacent CH₂ group, resulting in a triplet of triplets coupling pattern.

Given the options, the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen in product 3 is **triplet of triplets**.

**Answer: B**
