Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here about the Y-component of the intrinsic angular momentum operator for a muon. Hmm, let me try to think through it step by step.

The question says that Ay is represented by a 2x2 matrix, and it's given by c multiplied by S. Oh wait, c is h/(4π), right? And S has the first row as (0, -i) and the second row as (i, 0). So I can write that matrix S as:

S = [[0, -i],
     [i, 0]]

So Ay = (h/4π) * S. Let me compute that. Let me calculate each element.

The (1,1) element is 0*(h/4π) = 0.
(1,2) is (-i)*(h/4π) = (-i h)/(4π)
(2,1) is (i)*(h/4π) = (i h)/(4π)
(2,2) is 0 * (h/4π) = 0.

So Ay matrix becomes:

Ay = [ [0, (-i h)/(4π)],
        [(i h)/(4π), 0] ]

Now, I need to find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of Ay. Oh right, eigenvalues come from solving the characteristic equation det(Ay - a I) = 0.

The matrix (Ay - a I) is:

[ -a     (-i h)/(4π) ]
[ (i h)/(4π)     -a ]

The determinant would be (-a)(-a) - [ (-i h/(4π)) * (i h/(4π)) ) ] = a² - [ ( (-i)(i) (h^2)/(16π²) ) ]

Wait, (-i)(i) is (-i²) which is -(-1) = 1. So the second term becomes (1)*(h²/(16π²)).

So determinant equation is a² - (h²)/(16π²) = 0.

So a² = h²/(16π²) → a = ± h/(4π) * (1/2) ? Wait, wait. Let me compute the square root of both sides.

a = ± sqrt( h²/(16 π²) ) = ± (h/(4 π)) * (1/2) ? Wait, no. Wait, sqrt( h²/(16 π²) ) is h/(4 π), because (h/(4π)) squared is h²/(16 π²). So a is ± h/(4π) ?

Wait, wait, no. Let me double-check. The determinant equation is a² - (h²)/(16 π²) = 0. So a² = (h²)/(16 π²) → a = ± h/(4 π).

Wait, that can't be right because h/(4 π) is Planck's constant over 4 pi. But I thought the eigenvalues for spin components are ± ħ/2. Hmm, because for spin-1/2 systems, the eigenvalues of S_i are ± ħ/2. So S is like the Pauli matrices scaled by ħ/2.

Wait, wait a minute. Let me think about the matrix S. The matrix S given here is the Pauli Y matrix multiplied by something. The Pauli Y matrix is [[0, -i], [i,
