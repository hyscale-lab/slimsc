Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question is asking. 

The problem is about finding the eigenvector of a quantum mechanical operator P along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane, corresponding to the eigenvalue +ħ/2. Hmm, wait, I remember that in quantum mechanics, the spin operators have specific matrix representations, and eigenvectors correspond to spin states along a particular direction.

So the operator P seems to be a spin operator, probably for a spin-1/2 particle, like a muon. The components Px, Py, Pz are given as 2x2 matrices multiplied by ħ/2. Let me write them down:

Px is (ħ/2) times the matrix [[0,1],[1,0]]. That's the Pauli X matrix.
Py is (ħ/2) times [[0,-i],[i,0]]. That's the Pauli Y matrix.
Pz is (ħ/2) times [[1,0],[0,-1]]. That's the Pauli Z matrix.

So the operator for the direction n is the vector dot product of P and n. So P = n_x Px + n_y Py + n_z Pz. 

But wait, the direction n is in the x-z plane. That means n has components n_x, 0, n_z. So n is (n_x, 0, n_z). Since it's a unit vector, n_x² + n_z² = 1.

So the operator P·n becomes n_x (ħ/2) σx + n_z (ħ/2) σz, since the y-component is zero. Let me factor out (ħ/2), so it's (ħ/2)(n_x σx + n_z σz). 

The eigenvalue equation is P·n |ψ> = (ħ/2) |ψ>, because the eigenvalue is +ħ/2. So, (n_x σx + n_z σz) |ψ> = |ψ>.

Wait, no. Wait, eigenvalue equation is (P·n) |ψ> = (ħ/2) |ψ>. So substituting, (ħ/2)(n_x σx + n_z σz) |ψ> = (ħ/2) |ψ>. 

So I can multiply both sides by 2/ħ to eliminate the (ħ/2) factor, giving (n_x σx + n_z σz) |ψ> = |ψ>.

So we have to find the eigenvector corresponding to eigenvalue 1 for the matrix M = n_x σx + n_z σz. 

Alternatively, since σx and σz are Pauli matrices, this is a 2x2 matrix. Let me write M explicitly. 

σx is [[0,1],[1,0]], σz is [[1,0],[0,-1]]. So M = n_x [[0,1],[1,0]] + n_z [[1,0],[0,-1]] = [[n_z, n_x], [n_x, -n_z]].

Wait, let me compute each element:

Top left: n_z * 1 (from σz) + n_x * 0 (from σx) → n_z.

Top right: n_z * 0 + n_x * 1 → n_x.

Bottom left: same as top right because matrices are added element-wise. So n_x.

Bottom right: n_z * (-1) + n_x * 0 → -n_z.

So M is [[n_z, n_x], [n_x, -n_z]].

We need to find the eigenvector of M with eigenvalue 1. So, (M - I)|v> = 0, where I is the identity matrix.

So M - I is [[n_z - 1, n_x], [n_x, -n_z -1]].

The characteristic equation for eigenvalues is det(M - λ I) = 0. But since we're looking for eigenvalue 1, we can set up (M - I)|v> = 0.

So the equations are:

(n_z -1) v1 + n_x v2 = 0

n_x v1 + (-n_z -1) v2 = 0

These two equations must be satisfied.

Let me write them as:

(1) (n_z -1) v1 + n_x v2 = 0

(2) n_x v1 + (-n_z -1) v2 = 0

We can solve this system. Let me express equation (1) as:

v2 = [ (1 - n_z) v1 ] / n_x

Wait, unless n_x is zero. But since n is in the x-z plane and it's a unit vector, n_x can't be zero unless it's along the z-axis (n_z= ±1). But in the general case, n_x is non-zero, so we can proceed.

Substituting this into equation (2):

n_x v1 + (-n_z -1) [ (1 - n_z)/n_x v1 ] = 0

Multiply through by n_x to eliminate denominator:

n_x^2 v1 + (-n_z -1)(1 - n_z) v1 = 0

Simplify the second term: (-n_z -1)(1 - n_z) = (-n_z)(1) + (-n_z)(-n_z) + (-1)(1) + (-1)(-n_z) = -n_z + n_z² -1 +n_z = n_z² -1.

So equation becomes:

n_x² v1 + (n_z² -1) v1 =0

Factor v1:

[ n_x² + n_z² -1 ] v1 = 0

But since n is a unit vector, n_x² + n_z² =1. So:

1 -1 =0. So 0*v1=0, which is always true. So the two equations are dependent, which is expected for eigenvalues.

So from equation (1), v2 = [ (1 - n_z)/n_x ] v1.

So the eigenvector is proportional to [1, (1-n_z)/n_x ].

Let me write it as |v> = [v1; v2] = [1; (1 - n_z)/n_x ]

But wait, actually, since v1 can be any non-zero scalar, it's more convenient to set v1 = n_x (so that the denominator is gone). Let me see:

Let me set v1 = n_x. Then v2 = (1 - n_z) * (n_x) /n_x = (1 - n_z).

So the vector is [n_x, 1 - n_z ].

Wait, but I think I made a miscalculation here. Let me redo.

Wait, v2 = (1 -n_z ) v1 / n_x.

So if I set v1 = n_x, then v2 = (1 - n_z ) * (n_x) / n_x = (1 -n_z )

So the vector is [n_x, 1 -n_z ]

Wait, but I can also factor out n_x if needed. Alternatively, perhaps it's better to express the vector in terms of angles.

Since n is in the x-z plane, I can parameterize it using an angle θ, where θ is the angle from the z-axis. So, n_x = sin θ, n_z = cos θ.

Wait, no, wait. Wait, in spherical coordinates, the x-z plane would correspond to θ measured from the positive z-axis. So, in that case, n_x = sin θ * cos φ, but since it's in the x-z plane, φ is zero, so n_x = sin θ, and n_z = cos θ.

Wait, no, wait. Let me think. If the direction is in the x-z plane, then the polar angle θ is measured from the z-axis. So n_x = sin θ * cos phi, but if phi is zero, n_x = sin θ, and n_z= cos θ.

Wait, but sometimes people use different conventions for angles. So, perhaps it's better to define the direction n with angle θ from the z-axis, and since it's in the x-z plane, phi is zero. So n_x = sin θ, n_z = cos θ.

So substituting, our eigenvector components become:

v1 = n_x = sin θ

v2 = (1 - n_z ) = 1 - cos θ = 2 sin²(θ/2)

Wait, using the identity 1 - cos θ = 2 sin²(θ/2). So v2 = 2 sin²(θ/2). 

But let's write the vector as [ sin θ , 2 sin²(θ/2) ]

Hmm, but I can factor sin θ as 2 sin(θ/2) cos(θ/2). So let me see:

v1 = sin θ = 2 sin(theta/2) cos(theta/2)

v2 = 2 sin^2(theta/2)

So the vector is [ 2 sin(theta/2) cos(theta/2), 2 sin^2(theta/2) ]

We can factor out 2 sin(theta/2) from both components:

= 2 sin(theta/2) [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ]

So the normalized eigenvector would require dividing by the norm. The norm squared is |v1|^2 + |v2|^2.

Calculating the norm squared:

|v1|^2 = [2 sin(theta/2) cos(theta/2)]^2 = 4 sin²(theta/2) cos²(theta/2)

|v2|^2 = [2 sin(theta/2)]^2 = 4 sin^4(theta/2)

Adding them:

4 sin²(theta/2) [ cos²(theta/2) + sin²(theta/2) ] = 4 sin²(theta/2) * 1 = 4 sin²(theta/2)

So the norm is 2 |sin(theta/2)|. Since theta is between 0 and pi (because it's in the x-z plane, the angle can't be more than 180 degrees), sin(theta/2) is non-negative.

So the normalized vector is [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ] multiplied by [ 2 sin(theta/2) / (2 sin(theta/2)) ) ] 

Wait, wait. Wait, the vector after factoring is:

[ 2 sin(theta/2) cos(theta/2), 2 sin^2(theta/2) ] = 2 sin(theta/2) [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ]

The norm is 2 sin(theta/2), so the normalized vector is [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ]

But wait, that can't be right because when I normalize, I'd divide by the norm. So:

[ 2 sin(theta/2) cos(theta/2) ] / (2 sin(theta/2)) ), [ 2 sin^2(theta/2) ] / (2 sin(theta/2)) ) 

Simplifying each component:

First component: [2 sin(theta/2) cos(theta/2)] / [2 sin(theta/2)] = cos(theta/2)

Second component: [ 2 sin^2(theta/2) ] / [2 sin(theta/2) ] = sin(theta/2)

So the normalized eigenvector is [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ]

Wait, that's a familiar result. This is the spin-up state along the direction n, which in the x-z plane is parameterized by theta.

But wait, the eigenvector I found is [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ] which is the same as option C: (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)).

Looking at the options, option C is (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)).

Wait, but let me check the other options.

Option B is (cos(theta), e^{i phi} sin(theta)), but since n is in the x-z plane, phi is zero, so it would be (cos(theta), sin(theta)). But our result is in terms of theta/2.

Option D looks more complicated, involving sqrt(2/3) and sqrt(1/3) multiplied by hbar and theta/2. But I don't see any hbar in the eigenvector components because they are dimensionless (eigenvectors are defined up to a scalar multiple, which can have units but usually normalized).

Wait, the question says "what are the elements of the normalized eigenvector?" So the eigenvector shouldn't have any units like hbar. So options A and D have hbar in them, which probably makes them incorrect because eigenvectors are dimensionless.

Option B includes e^{i phi}, but since n is in the x-z plane, phi is zero, so e^{i phi} is 1. But our result doesn't have a phi term.

Wait, but in the problem statement, the eigenvector is for the operator P along n, which is in the x-z plane. So phi is zero, so the eigenvector should not have any e^{i phi} term. So option B includes e^{i phi}, which is not part of our solution, so B is probably incorrect.

So the correct normalized eigenvector is (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)), which is option C.

But wait, let me think again. When you have a spin-1/2 system, the eigenstates for spin up along a direction n are given by the Bloch vector. The state is |+> = cos(theta/2) |0> + e^{i phi} sin(theta/2)|1>. 

Ah, right, so in general, the state is [ cos(theta/2), e^{i phi} sin(theta/2) ].

But in our case, phi is zero because the direction is in the x-z plane, so phi =0. So the state becomes [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ].

Which matches option C. So the correct answer is C.


The problem involves finding the normalized eigenvector of the quantum mechanical operator $\vec{P}$ for a muon along an arbitrary direction $\vec{n}$ in the x-z plane, corresponding to the eigenvalue $+\hbar/2$. The components of $\vec{P}$ are given as $P_x$, $P_y$, and $P_z$, which are proportional to the Pauli matrices. The operator $\vec{P} \cdot \vec{n}$ is constructed as $n_x P_x + n_z P_z$, where $\vec{n} = (n_x, 0, n_z)$ is a unit vector in the x-z plane. This simplifies to $P \cdot n = \frac{\hbar}{2} (n_x \sigma_x + n_z \sigma_z)$, where $\sigma_x$ and $\sigma_z$ are the Pauli matrices.

The eigenvalue equation is $(P \cdot n) | \psi \rangle = \frac{\hbar}{2} | \psi \rangle$. Factoring out $\frac{\hbar}{2}$, the effective matrix becomes $M = n_x \sigma_x + n_z \sigma_z = \begin{bmatrix} n_z & n_x \\ n_x & -n_z \end{bmatrix}$. Solving for the eigenvector corresponding to eigenvalue $1$, the equations $(M - I)|v\rangle = 0$ yield the eigenvector components $v_1$ and $v_2$ in terms of $n_x$ and $n_z$. 

To simplify, the direction $\vec{n}$ is parameterized using the polar angle $\theta$ from the z-axis, with $n_x = \sin\theta$ and $n_z = \cos\theta$. Substituting these into the eigenvector components, the normalized eigenvector is found to be:

\[
| \psi \rangle = \begin{bmatrix} \cos(\theta/2) \\ \sin(\theta/2) \end{bmatrix}.
\]

This matches option C. Analyzing the other options:

- **Option A** includes $\hbar$ in the components, which is incorrect because eigenvectors are dimensionless.
- **Option B** includes $e^{i\phi}$, but since $\vec{n}$ lies in the x-z plane, $\phi = 0$, so this term is absent.
- **Option D** introduces additional coefficients like $\sqrt{2/3}$ and $\sqrt{1/3}$, which are not present in the derived eigenvector.

Thus, the correct normalized eigenvector is given by option C: $(\cos(\theta/2), \sin(\theta/2))$.

Answer: C
