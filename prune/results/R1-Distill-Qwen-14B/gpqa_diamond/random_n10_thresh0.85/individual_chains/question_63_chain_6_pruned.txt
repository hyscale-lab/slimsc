Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here about a diatomic molecule. Hmm, I remember diatomic molecules are made of two atoms, right? The question is about the quantum rotation-vibration model, which I think is sometimes called the non-rigid rotor model. I've heard that in this model, the molecule can have both rotational and vibrational energy states.

The problem says the molecule is in its fundamental state. Oh wait, the fundamental state is the lowest energy state, right? So it's the ground state for both rotation and vibration. Now, the question is about what photon momentum is needed when the molecule absorbs a photon to switch to the next state with the lowest possible energy.

Wait, when it says the next state with the lowest possible energy, I'm thinking that might be the next higher energy state. But wait, the molecule is diatomic, so it has both rotational and vibrational energy levels. The fundamental state would be the lowest vibrational state (v=0) and the lowest rotational state (like J=0 or J=1? I'm a bit fuzzy here).

Wait, I think for a diatomic molecule, the rotational states are quantized with J being the rotational quantum number. The ground state for rotation is J=0, but for a rigid rotor, the energy levels are proportional to J(J+1). So, the next state for rotation would be J=1. But wait, in the rotation-vibration model, the total energy is a combination of both. Oh, but the vibration is considered as a harmonic oscillator, so it can change its vibrational state too.

But the question says the molecule is in the fundamental state, which I think is v=0 and J=0. When it absorbs a photon, it can transition to a higher state. The next state with the lowest possible energy would be the first possible higher state, which could be either a vibrational or a rotational transition.

Wait, but in quantum mechanics transitions, a photon can cause a change in either the vibrational or rotational state. So which one would require more energy (or a higher photon momentum)? That's probably the key here.

Let me think about the energies involved. The vibrational energy levels are quantized as Ev = (v + 1/2) ħω, where ω is the angular frequency given as 4e14 rad/s. The rotational energy is Er = B J (J+1), where B is the rotational constant, which depends on the moment of inertia.

The moment of inertia I is μ r², where μ is the reduced mass, and r is the bond length. Oh, right, so I need to calculate the reduced mass μ first.

The masses given are Mx = 20 amu and My = 2 amu. So the reduced mass μ is (Mx * My) / (Mx + My) = (20 * 2)/(20 + 2) = 40/22 = 20/11 amu. Wait, 20+2 is 22, yeah. So μ is (20 * 2)/(22) = 40/22 = 20/11 amu. Hmm, 20/11 is approximately 1.818 amu.

Wait, but I should convert amu to kilograms because the Planck constant is in kg. One amu is approximately 1.6605e-27 kg. So μ = (20/11) * 1.6605e-27 kg. Let me compute that.

20/11 is about 1.8182. So 1.8182 * 1.6605e-27 kg = let's see:

1.8182 * 1.6605 = approx 3.016e0. So 3.016e-27 kg? Wait, wait, 1.8182 * 1.6605 is more like 3.016, right. So μ ≈ 3.016e-27 kg.

Wait, no, wait, 20 amu is 20 * 1.66e-27 kg, but that's Mx. Let me compute it correctly.

Wait, no, wait: μ is (20 * 2) / (20 + 2) in amu, which as I said is 40/22 ≈ 1.818 amu. So μ = (40/22) * 1.6605e-27 kg. Let me calculate that more accurately.

40/22 = 20/11 ≈ 1.81818 amu.

So μ = 1.81818 * 1.6605e-27 kg. Let me compute that:

1.81818 * 1.6605 ≈ 3.015 kg? Wait no, 1.8 * 1.66 is about 2.988, so 3.015e-27 kg. So μ ≈ 3.015e-27 kg.

The bond length R is 2 angstroms. 1 angstrom is 1e-10 meters, so R is 2e-10 meters.

So the moment of inertia I = μ R² = 3.015e-27 kg * (2e-10 m)^2 = 3.015e-27 * 4e-20 = 1.206e-46 kg·m².

Now, the rotational constant B is ħ/(4I), where ħ is the reduced Planck constant. Wait, no, let me think again. The rotational energy levels are given by Er = B J (J+1), where B = (ħ²)/(2I).

Wait, actually, the rotational constant B is defined as ħ/(4π c I), but when using the rotational energy formula, Er = B J (J+1), with B in cm^-1. Hmm, but I'm not sure. Maybe I should just compute the energy difference between rotational states.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate the energy difference between the J=0 and J=1 states. Because if the molecule is in the fundamental state (v=0, J=0), the next possible lower energy state would be either increasing v or J.

Wait, wait, the question is about the next state with the lowest possible energy. So perhaps the molecule could either increase its vibrational state (v goes to 1) or rotational state (J goes to 1). Which requires a lower energy photon.

So which transition has a lower energy: vibrational or rotational.

Wait, the vibrational energy levels are Ev = (v + 1/2) ħω. The difference between v=0 and v=1 is ΔE_vib = ħω. For the rotational, the energy difference between J=0 and J=1 is ΔE_rot = B [1*(1+1) - 0*(0+1)] = 2B.

So to find which is smaller, I need to compute both ΔE_vib and ΔE_rot.

Let me compute both.

ΔE_vib = ħ * ω.

Given ω is 4e14 rad/s. ħ is approximately 1.0545718e-34 J·s.

So ΔE_vib = 1.0545718e-34 * 4e14 = 4.218e-20 J.

Now, let's compute ΔE_rot. For that, I need B, which is the rotational constant.

B = (ħ²)/(2I), where I is the moment of inertia.

Wait, no, B is defined as the rotational constant such that Er = B J (J+1). The units can be tricky, but I think in terms of energy, B would be in Joules.

So B = ħ²/(2I).

I have I as 1.206e-46 kg·m².

So B = (1.0545718e-34)^2 / (2 * 1.206e-46) )

Let me compute that.

Numerator: (1.0545718e-34)^2 ≈ 1.112e-68 (since 1e-34 squared is 1e-68, and 1.05^2 is approx 1.1025).

Denominator: 2 * 1.206e-46 = 2.412e-46.

So B = 1.112e-68 / 2.412e-46 ≈ (1.112 / 2.412) * 1e-22.

1.112 / 2.412 ≈ 0.461. So B ≈ 0.461e-22 J.

Wait, that's 4.61e-23 J.

Then, ΔE_rot for J=0 → J=1 is 2B = 2 * 4.61e-23 = 9.22e-23 J.

Comparing to ΔE_vib which was 4.218e-20 J, which is much bigger. Wait, no, wait, 4.2e-20 is larger than 9.2e-23? No, wait, 4.2e-20 is 420e-22, and 9.2e-23 is about 9.2e-23. So 4.2e-20 is much bigger than 9.2e-23. So ΔE_rot is about 9.2e-23 J, and ΔE_vib is 4.2e-20 J. So the rotational transition requires less energy.

So the molecule would preferentially absorb a photon that allows it to transition to a lower energy state. Wait, no, wait, when a molecule absorbs a photon, it goes to a higher energy state. So in this case, the question says the molecule is in the fundamental state and wants to switch to the next state with the lowest possible energy. Hmm, but the next state would be the one with the least energy increase.

Wait, but the fundamental state is the lowest. So the next state could be either a higher vibrational state or a higher rotational state. So which of these requires the least energy? Because the photon needs to supply that energy.

Since ΔE_rot is smaller than ΔE_vib, the photon required for the rotational transition would have lower energy, so a lower momentum. Because momentum p is related to energy E through p = E/c, since for a photon E = pc.

Wait, right! Photon momentum is p = E/c. So the momentum depends on the energy of the photon.

So the photon needed for the rotational transition would have lower momentum than the vibrational transition. So the molecule would absorb a photon with the energy corresponding to the rotational transition, which is lower than the vibrational one. But wait, the question says it's in the fundamental state and wants to switch to the next state with the lowest possible energy. So that would be the transition requiring the least energy, which is the rotational one. So the photon's momentum is p = ΔE_rot / c.

Wait, but earlier I thought the molecule is in the fundamental state (v=0, J=0). So when it absorbs a photon, it can either go to v=1, J=0 or v=0, J=1. The question is about the next state with the lowest possible energy. So the transition with the smallest energy increase is the rotational one, so that's the one it would take.

So the energy of the photon needed is ΔE_rot = 2B = 9.22e-23 J. Therefore, the photon's momentum is p = E/c.

Let me compute that. Planck's constant h is 6.626e-34 J·s, but for the speed of light c, it's 3e8 m/s.

So p = E/c = 9.22e-23 J / 3e8 m/s.

9.22e-23 / 3e8 = approx 3.073e-31 kg·m/s. Wait, but wait, I must have made a mistake because the options are on the order of 1e-27 to 1e-28.

Wait, that's a problem. Because 3e-31 is way smaller than the options given.

Hmm, did I make a mistake in calculating B?

Let me recheck the calculation for B.

I think B is ħ²/(2I). So let's compute that again.

I = μ r² = (20*2)/(22) amu * (2e-10 m)^2.

Wait, let me recompute I:

μ = (20 * 2) / (20 + 2) = 40/22 ≈ 1.81818 amu.

1.81818 amu = 1.81818 * 1.6605e-27 kg ≈ 3.015e-27 kg.

R = 2 angstroms = 2e-10 m.

I = μ R² = 3.015e-27 kg * (2e-10 m)^2 = 3.015e-27 * 4e-20 = 1.206e-46 kg·m².

So B = ħ²/(2I).

Calculate ħ squared: (1.0545718e-34 J·s)^2 = approx 1.112e-68 (J·s)^2.

Divide by 2I: 2 * 1.206e-46 = 2.412e-46 kg·m².

So B = (1.112e-68) / (2.412e-46) = (1.112 / 2.412) * 1e-22.

1.112 / 2.412 ≈ 0.461, so B ≈ 0.461e-22 J.

Wait, 0.461e-22 J is 4.61e-23 J.

So ΔE_rot = 2B = 9.22e-23 J.

But then p = E/c = 9.22e-23 / 3e8 = 3.07e-31 kg·m/s. Hmm, that's 3.07e-31 N·s (since 1 N·s = 1 kg·m/s).

But the options are in 1e-27 to 1e-28 N·s, which is much larger. So I must have a mistake here.

Wait, perhaps I messed up the model. Because the question says it's modeled using the quantum rotation-vibration model, which could be a non-rigid rotor, but perhaps it's considering the vibration as well. Oh wait, the non-rigid rotor model is an extension where the bond length can change, so it accounts for both rotation and vibration.

Wait, perhaps the energy transition isn't just a pure rotational or vibrational change. Maybe the molecule can change both rotational and vibrational states. But the question says to switch to the next state with the lowest possible energy. So the first possible higher energy state, which might involve a vibrational transition, perhaps from v=0 to v=1, but that would require a higher energy.

Alternatively, perhaps the next state after the fundamental state is a rotational state. But in that case, the calculation I did earlier gives a momentum way lower than the options given. So where did I go wrong?

Wait, let me think again about the photon momentum.

Alternatively, perhaps the model is such that the molecule's energy is a combination of both rotational and vibrational energies, and the transition is to the next higher state, which could be either a higher vibration or higher rotation.

Wait, but the problem says the molecule is in the fundamental state. The fundamental state is the lowest vibrational state (v=0) and the lowest rotational state (J=0). The next state could be either J=1 with v=0 or v=1 with J=0.

Which of these has the lowest energy? Because the question asks for the photon that allows the molecule to switch to the next state with the lowest possible energy.

So I need to compute the energy differences for both transitions and see which is smaller.

Compute ΔE for v=0, J=0 → v=0, J=1.

That's just the rotational transition: ΔE_rot = 2B = 2 * (ħ²/(2I)) = ħ²/I.

Wait, no, I said earlier B = ħ²/(2I), so 2B is 2*(ħ²/(2I)) = ħ²/(I).

Earlier calculation: B ≈ 4.61e-
