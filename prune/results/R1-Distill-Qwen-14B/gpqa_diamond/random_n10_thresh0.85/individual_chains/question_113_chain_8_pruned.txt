Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question is about.

The question is about identifying an unknown compound using its spectroscopy data. The techniques used are FTIR, 1H NMR, and Mass Spectrometry. The possible formulas are all C6H something O or O2. The options are A) C6H12O2, B) C6H10O, C) C6H10O2, D) C6H12O.

Hmm. Let me break down each part of the data given.

Starting with the FTIR: it shows a very broad absorption peak around 3000 cm^-1. Broad peaks in IR usually indicate O-H stretching. A very broad peak might be from an alcohol or maybe a carboxylic acid. Wait, if it's a carboxylic acid, the O-H stretch is usually even broader and around 2500-3300, but it can vary. Alternatively, if it's a carbonyl group, but no, the peak around 1700 and 1650 are probably carbonyl (C=O) stretches.

So the IR has a broad peak at 3000, which could be O-H. Then peaks at 1700 and 1650. Wait, two carbonyl peaks? Or maybe one is a C=O and the other is something else, like an aromatic ring (maybe C=C in conjugation). Hmm, in some structures, conjugated carbonyls can show lower wavenumbers. For example, if it's an aromatic ketone, maybe the C=O is around 1680 or so. Or maybe one is a ketone (around 1700) and the other is an C=C double bond in an aromatic ring (around 1650? Wait, I thought C=C in alkenes is usually around 1600-1680, but aromatic rings are around 1450-1600? Maybe I'm getting that wrong.

Wait, wait. Let me think again. The carbonyl group (C=O) in a ketone, aldehyde, or ester typically shows up around 1700 cm^-1. The 1650 peak might be another carbonyl, perhaps conjugated, or maybe an aromatic ring. Alternatively, it could be an amide, but the question doesn't mention any nitrogen.

Wait, but the options are all oxygen-containing, so maybe esters or something else. Alternatively, maybe the 1650 peak is a conjugated carbonyl, like an alpha, beta-unsaturated ketone (enone), where the C=O is around 1700 and the C=C is around 1650. That's possible.

But then the FTIR has a broad peak at 3000, which I think is O-H. So maybe the compound has an alcohol group or a carboxylic acid.

Wait, but if it's a carboxylic acid, the O-H would be very broad and maybe even show a peak around 2500-3300 as a broad band. Alternatively, if it's an ester, the O-H is from an alcohol, but esters don't have O-H. Wait, wait. Esters have an O-CO-O structure. Wait, no, esters are R-O-CO-R. Wait, but the O-H would be from an alcohol, but if the compound is an ester, it wouldn't have an O-H unless it's an alcohol as a substituent. Hmm, perhaps I'm getting confused.

So, the FTIR shows a broad peak, so maybe an alcohol group (-OH) is present. Alternatively, maybe a carbonyl and an O-H. Let me think about the possible functional groups.

Next, looking at the 1H NMR. It says there are several peaks, including those corresponding to vinyl hydrogens. Vinyl hydrogens are the H's attached to a double bond, like in an alkene. So the compound must have a double bond, probably a vinyl group. So maybe the compound has both a carbonyl group (from the IR) and a double bond.

The Mass Spectrometry shows a fragment peak at m/z =45. Hmm, 45 is a common mass for a fragment. Let me think about what that could be. 45 could be C3H7O+ or maybe something else. Wait, 45 is the molecular weight of (CH3)2O, which is 31, no. Wait, 45 is the same as C3H7O (3*12 +7*1 +16 = 36+7+16=60? No, that's not right. Wait, 45 is 45 amu. Let me think: what has a mass of 45?

CO+ has 28 (C=12, O=16). No, that's 28. Hmm. Maybe it's CH2O ( formaldehyde )? No, that's 30. Wait, maybe (CH3O)+? 16 + 12 +3=31. No. Wait, perhaps a fragment that's CH3CO (43), but that's 43. Alternatively, what about C3H7+? 3*12 +7 = 43 again. Hmm. Or maybe the methyl group (15) plus something else. Not sure. Alternatively, the fragment could be from a ketone group. Wait, maybe the molecular ion breaks down into a smaller fragment.

Wait, another approach: the molecular formula is either C6H12O2, C6H10O, C6H10O2, or C6H12O. Let's compute the molecular weight of each.

C6H12O2: (6*12)+(12*1)+(2*16)=72+12+32=116 g/mol.

C6H10O: (6*12)+(10*1)+(16)=72+10+16=98.

C6H10O2: 72+10 +32=114.

C6H12O: 72+12 +16=100.

So the molecular ion would be around these masses. The mass spec shows a peak at 45. So maybe the molecular ion loses some parts. Let's think about possible fragmentations.

If the peak at 45 is a notable fragment, perhaps it's the loss of a larger group. For example, if the compound is an ester, maybe the ester group breaks off.

Wait, if the molecular formula is C6H10O2 (option C), the molecular weight is 114. If a fragment is 45, perhaps the molecule breaks into 45 and 69 (114-45=69). What's 45? Maybe (CH3)2CHO+? No, wait, (CH3)2CHO would be 76. Alternatively, maybe (CH2)2O
