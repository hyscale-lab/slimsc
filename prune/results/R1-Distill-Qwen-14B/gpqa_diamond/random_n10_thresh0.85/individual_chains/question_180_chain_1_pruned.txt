Okay, so I have this physics problem here, and I'm supposed to find the minimum energy of a system of charges. Hmm, let me read it again.

The problem says there are 13 identical particles, each with a charge of 2e. Twelve of them are constrained to stay at 2 meters from a point P, and the 13th charge is fixed at P. I need to find the minimum energy of this system, and the options are given.

Wait, I remember that the potential energy of a system of charges is related to their configuration. To find the minimum energy, I think I need to consider the arrangement that would give the lowest potential energy.

But wait, the charges are identical. Since they're all 2e, which is a positive charge because e is the elementary charge. So, same charges repel each other. So, the configuration that would minimize the potential energy would be when the charges are as far apart as possible, right? Or wait, no, wait. Wait, no, the potential energy between two positive charges increases as they get closer because they repel each other. So, to minimize the potential energy, we need to maximize the potential energy, no, wait no. Wait, no, wait. I'm getting confused.

Wait, wait. For a system of like charges, the potential energy is minimized when the charges are as far apart as possible. Because when charges are closer, the potential energy is higher. So, for minimum potential energy, the charges should be as spread out as possible. So, if some charges are fixed, others are at a certain distance, how does that work?

Wait, the 13th charge is
