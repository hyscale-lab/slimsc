Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Hmm, let me try to figure it out step by step. The question is about finding the eigenvector of a quantum mechanical operator P for a muon along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane. The eigenvalue is +ħ/2.

Wait, the operator P is given with its X, Y, Z components. So P is a vector operator, right? So each component is an operator, and I guess the total operator P would be the vector sum along direction n. Oh wait, the operator along an arbitrary direction n is the dot product of P and n, so P·n = n_x P_x + n_y P_y + n_z P_z.

But the direction n is in the x-z plane, so that means the y-component of n is zero. So n is (n_x, 0, n_z). Since it's a direction, it should be a unit vector. So n_x² + n_z² = 1.

Wait, but the question says the muon is moving along an arbitrary direction n in x-z plane. So the operator in that direction would be P·n. So the operator we're considering is P_n = n_x P_x + n_z P_z. Because n_y is zero.

Now, each of the components P_x, P_y, P_z are 2x2 matrices multiplied by ħ/2. Let me write them down.

P_x is (ħ/2) * [[0, 1], [1, 0]]
P_y is (ħ/2) * [[0, -i], [i, 0]]
P_z is (ħ/2) * [[1, 0], [0, -1]]

So P_n = (ħ/2) [n_x * [[0,1],[1,0]] + n_z * [[1,0],[0,-1]] ]

Wait, because n is a unit vector, so n_x² + n_z² =1. Let me represent n as (sinθ cosφ, 0, sinθ sinφ), but wait, no. Since it's in x-z, maybe better to parameterize it with θ as the angle from the z-axis. So n_x = sinθ, n_z = cosθ. Because in spherical coordinates, the x component is sinθ cosφ, but since here it's constrained to x-z, φ would be zero, so n_x = sinθ, n_z=cosθ. Wait, that might not be right. Let me think again. If the direction is in x-z plane, then φ is 0 or π. Let's say n is (cosθ, 0, sinθ), but wait, that depends on the coordinate system. Alternatively, perhaps it's better to write n as (n_x, 0, n_z), where n_x^2 +n_z^2 =1.

So P_n = (ħ/2) [ n_x * sigma_x + n_z * sigma_z ]

Where sigma matrices are the Pauli matrices. Sigma_x is [[0,1],[1,0]], sigma_z is [[1,0],[0,-1]].

So the operator is (ħ/2) times (n_x sigma_x + n_z sigma_z).

We need to find the eigenvector of this operator with eigenvalue +ħ/2.

So the eigenvalue equation is:

P_n |v> = (ħ/2) |v>

Wait, no. Wait, the eigenvalue is +ħ/2. So (P_n) |v> = (ħ/2) |v> ?

Wait, no, no. Wait, the operator is P·n. So the operator here is (ħ/2)(n_x sigma_x + n_z sigma_z). So the eigenvalue equation is:

(ħ/2)(n_x sigma_x + n_z sigma_z) |v> = (ħ/2) |v>

Multiply both sides by 2/ħ:

(n_x sigma_x + n_z sigma_z) |v> = |v>

So (n_x sigma_x + n_z sigma_z) |v> = |v>

Hmm, so the matrix equation is:

[ [n_z, n_x],
  [n_x, -n_z] ] * [a; b] = [a; b]

Wait, let's compute the matrix. Sigma_x is [[0,1],[1,0]], sigma_z is diag(1, -1). So the matrix is n_x * [[0,1],[1,0]] + n_z * [[1, 0], [0, -1]]

So the matrix becomes:

[[n_z, n_x],
 [n_x, -n_z]]

So the equation is:

[[n_z,
