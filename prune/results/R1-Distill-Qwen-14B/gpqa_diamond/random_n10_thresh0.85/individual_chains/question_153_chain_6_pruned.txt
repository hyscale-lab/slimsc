Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here about Michael additions. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question again to make sure I understand what's being asked.

The question presents three different Michael addition reactions and asks about their reactants and major products. The reactions are:

1. dimethyl malonate + methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate in the presence of NaOEt (sodium ethoxide) and EtOH (ethanol) to give product A.

2. 1-(cyclohex-1-en-1-yl)piperidine + (E)-but-2-enenitrile with MeOH (methanol) and H3O+ (probably as a proton source) to give product B.

3. C + but-3-en-2-one with KOH and H2O to give 2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexane-1,3-dione.

The options are A, B, C, D, each giving possible products A, B, and C.

I remember that Michael addition is a 1,4-addition (conjugate addition) where a nucleophile attacks the beta carbon of an alpha-beta unsaturated carbonyl compound. The attacking nucleophile is usually enolate, which can be formed from a malonate or similar.

Starting with reaction (A): dimethyl malonate and methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate with NaOEt.

Dimethyl malonate is a good enolate donor. NaOEt (a strong base) would deprotonate the alpha position of the malonate to form an enolate. The enolate would then attack the beta position (the less substituted carbon) of the alpha-beta unsaturated carbonyl (the acrylate in this case).

Looking at the structure of methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate: The structure is CH2=CH-CO-OCH3, but wait, wait, no. Wait, 3-(p-tolyl)acrylate would be CH2=CH-C-(p-tolyl), attached to the acrylate. Wait, actually, the correct structure is:

The acrylate is CH2=CHCO-OCH3. But wait, 3-(p-tolyl)acrylate would be CH2=CH-C(p-tolyl)-OCH3? Hmm, wait, perhaps it's more like CH2=C(C6H4-4Me)CO-OCH3? No, wait, the numbering might be different. Alternatively, the structure is (E)-3-(p-tolyl)propenoate methyl ester. So the double bond is between C1 and C2, the carbonyl is at C3. So the structure is CH2=CH-CO-OCH3 but with the p-tolyl group on the third carbon. Wait, or is it CH2-CH(C6H4-4Me)-CO-OCH3? No, wait, 3-(p-tolyl)acrylate would be CH2=CH-C(p-tolyl)-OCH3. No, that can't be right. Wait, perhaps it's CH2=C(CO-OCH3)-C6H
