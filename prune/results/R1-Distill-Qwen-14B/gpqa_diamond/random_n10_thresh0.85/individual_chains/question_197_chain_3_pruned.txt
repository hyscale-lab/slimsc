Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. Let me try to figure it out step by step. The question is about identifying the product when Compound X reacts with red phosphorus and HI. The options are four different compounds, so I need to determine which one is the correct product based on the given IR and NMR data.

First, I'll look at the IR data. The peaks are at 3400–2500 cm⁻¹, which usually indicates an O-H stretch. That could mean either an alcohol or a carboxylic acid. The 1720 cm⁻¹ peak suggests a carbonyl group, like a ketone, aldehyde, ester, or carboxylic acid. The peak at 1610 cm⁻¹ and 1450 cm⁻¹ might be aromatic C=C stretching. So, putting that together, maybe there's an aromatic ring with a carbonyl group and an O-H.

Now looking at the 1H NMR data: 

- 10.5 ppm (bs, 1H): That's a strong, broad peak. Could be an O-H proton, like from a carboxylic acid because alcohols usually have lower ppm and might be split into something else. Alternatively, maybe an aldehyde proton, but those are usually around 9-10, but not as broad. Wait, aldehyde protons are usually around 9-10, but a carboxylic acid OH is around 10-12, so 10.5 seems more like a carboxylic acid.

- 8.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.2 ppm (d, 2H): This looks like two doublets, each integrating to 2H. So maybe a para-substituted benzene ring. The higher ppm (8.0) could be the protons adjacent to an electron-withdrawing group, like a carbonyl. The lower (7.2) might be the ones opposite or meta. Wait, but in para substitution, each pair would be equivalent. So if it's a para-substituted benzene, maybe with two substituents in the para positions. But wait, the substituent might have a carbonyl group. Alternatively, perhaps it's a benzene ring with a substituent that deshields the protons. For example, in benzoic acid, the protons next to the COOH group would be more deshielded, hence higher ppm.

The other peaks: 2.9 ppm (m, 1H) – a multiplet, maybe a CH next to something. 1.7 ppm (m, 2H) – could be adjacent to another CH and part of a chain. 1.4 ppm (d, 3H) – a CH3 group attached to something, maybe a CH2. And 0.9 ppm (t, 3H) – a terminal CH3, perhaps as an ethyl group.

Putting this together: Let's imagine the benzene ring has a substituent that includes a carbonyl group. The 10.5 ppm peak suggests a carboxylic acid, so maybe the benzene is attached to a COOH group. The substituent would then be COOH. But wait, the IR at 1720 cm⁻¹: the carbonyl of a carboxylic acid is usually around 1700 cm⁻¹, but sometimes a bit higher. So that fits.

So the structure might be a benzene ring with a COOH group and another substituent. The substituent would be a group attached to the ring, perhaps in the para position relative to the COOH. Let's look at the NMR again.

The substituent's NMR signals: 2.9 ppm (m, 1H) – perhaps a CH group attached to something else. 1.7 (m, 2H) could be a CH2 next to a CH. 1.4 (d, 3H) is a CH3 attached to a CH, which is next to another CH2. 0.9 (t, 3H) is a CH2CH3 group.

Wait, so perhaps the substituent is a chain like -CH(CH2CH2CH3) or something else. Let me think. The substituent is attached to the benzene. Let's say it's in the para position relative to the COOH. So the substituent would be, say, a propyl group in some configuration.

Alternatively, the substituent might be a butyl group. Let's see: the 1.4 ppm (d, 3H) could be a CH(CH3) group. The 2.9 ppm (m, 1H) would then be the CH attached to the benzene. The 1.7 (m, 2H) could be two CH2 groups, and the 0.9 (t, 3H) is a terminal CH3. Wait, that would make the substituent a sec-butyl group. So the substituent would be CH2CH(CH2CH3) attached to the benzene.

Let me draw that out. The benzene ring has a COOH group and a sec-butyl group in para positions. So the structure would be 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. Does that fit the options?

Looking at the options:

Option C is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. That matches what I was thinking. So that's a possibility.

Wait, but let's make sure. The substituent would be a sec-butyl group. So the substituent would be -CH2CH(CH2CH3)- attached to the ring? No, wait, sec-butyl is CH(CH2CH2CH3)CH2-? No, wait. Wait, the structure of sec-butyl is CH2CH(CH3)CH2- but I might be getting confused. Let me think again. The substituent is a butyl group where the point of attachment is on the second carbon. So the substituent would be -CH2CH(CH2CH3)-. Wait, no. Let's correct: the structure of sec-butyl is CH2CH(CH2CH3)– but wait, that's not right. The correct structure of a sec-butyl group is -CH2CH(CH2CH3)-? No, wait. Let me be precise. Butyl has four carbons. The substituent is attached to the second carbon. So the substituent is CH2CH(CH2CH3)-. Wait, no, I think I'm getting this wrong. Let me recall: the butyl group is -CH2CH2CH2CH2-. The sec-butyl would be the substituent attached to the second carbon, so it's -CH(CH2CH2CH3). Wait, no. Wait, the butyl group is four carbons in a row. So for sec-but
