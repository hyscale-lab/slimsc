Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. Let me try to think through it step by step. The question is about identifying a compound based on its IR and NMR data, then figuring out the product when it reacts with red phosphorus and HI. Hmm.

First, let's look at the IR data. The peaks are at 3400–2500 cm⁻¹, which probably indicates an O-H stretch, maybe from a carboxylic acid or an alcohol. Wait, but the peak is in that range which is broad. Oh wait, the 1720 cm⁻¹ is a strong peak, which makes me think of a carbonyl group, like a ketone or an ester or a carboxylic acid. The 1610 and 1450 cm⁻¹ might be aromatic C=C stretching. So maybe the compound has an aromatic ring with a carbonyl group attached?

Looking at the NMR data. The 1H NMR shows several peaks. The first peak is at 10.5 ppm (bs, 1H). That's a high shift, probably an -OH proton, like from a carboxylic acid. Carboxylic acids have protons around 10-12 ppm. So maybe the compound is a benzoic acid derivative.

The next peak is at 8.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.2 ppm (d, 2H). That suggests a para-substituted aromatic ring, because two doublets with equal integration (each 2H) would mean two substituents opposite each other. So maybe it's a benzene ring with two substituents in para positions.

Wait, the substituents could be an -OH group and another group. Wait, but looking back at the IR, the 1720 could be a carbonyl. So if it's a para-substituted benzene with a carbonyl group, like a benzoyl group? Or maybe a ketone?

Wait, but the NMR also shows a peak at 2.9 ppm (m, 1H), which is a multiplet. That could be a methylene adjacent to an oxygen, like in an ether or maybe an ester. Or perhaps a CH group next to a carbonyl, like in an acyl group. Then there's 1.7 ppm (m, 2H), which might be a CH2 group near another CH or something. Then 1.4 ppm (d, 3H) – a triplet? No, it's a doublet, which could be a CH2CH3 group attached to something else. And 0.9 ppm (t, 3H), a terminal CH3, which is probably from an ethyl group or a larger alkyl chain.

Putting this together. Let me sketch the possible structure.

The aromatic ring has something in the para position. The 10.5 ppm indicates a carboxylic acid group. So maybe the substituent is a carboxylic acid. Wait, but a benzene ring with a carboxylic acid would be a benzoic acid derivative. But the other substituent is... the 10.5 ppm could be the -OH of the acid. Then, the other substituent would be a side chain.

Wait, but the NMR shows a multiplet at 2.9 ppm for 1H. So perhaps that's a CH group adjacent to an oxygen. Let me think: maybe the structure is something like para-substituted phenyl with a carbonyl group attached to a CH2CH2CH3 or similar group.

Wait, another approach: the IR has a 1720 cm⁻¹ peak, which is a strong carbonyl. So if it's a carboxylic acid, the carbonyl would be higher, around 1700 but can be broader. But wait, I think the IR for a carboxylic acid is a broad O-H around 2500-3300, and the carbonyl around 1700. The 1720 here is a bit higher, which might suggest an ester or a ketone. Alternatively, maybe it's a benzene ring with a ketone group attached. Or maybe an acyl group attached to the ring.

Wait, but the NMR has a peak at 10.5 ppm, which is very high. That's more indicative of a carboxylic acid. So perhaps it's a phenyl group connected to a carboxylic acid, with another substituent.

Wait, but the aromatic ring in the NMR has two doublets, so it's para-substituted. So the substituents are on opposite sides. Let's say, one substituent is a -COOH group and the other is an alkyl chain. Wait, but 10.5 ppm is for the -OH, which would be part of the -COOH group.

Wait, but if the substituents are -COOH and another group on the benzene ring, then the NMR would show those aromatic protons as two doublets. That fits with the 8.0 and 7.2 ppm peaks. So maybe it's 4-(substituted)benzoic acid.

Wait, let's think about the substituents. The NMR also has a peak at 2.9 ppm (m, 1H). That could be a CH group next to an oxygen. Let's say, maybe a group like -CH2-CO- or something. But then the 1.7 ppm is a multiplet for 2H, which might be another CH2. Then 1.4 ppm (d, 3H) is a CH3 attached to a CH2, perhaps. And the 0.9 ppm (t, 3H) is a terminal CH3, which would be in an ethyl group.

Putting this together: maybe the structure is something like a benzene ring with a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) in one position and an ethyl group in the para position, but that doesn't quite fit. Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a side chain that's branched.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a butyl group attached in a certain way. Let me think about the NMR. The 2.9 ppm (1H) could be a CH in the middle of a chain, like a CH connected to an oxygen. Let's think of a structure like benzene with a -COOH group and a -OCH2CH(CH2CH3)2 group? Hmm, not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a propyl group with a branch. Let me think about the NMR signals:

At 2.9 ppm (m, 1H) – maybe a CH adjacent to a carbonyl or oxygen.

At 1.7 ppm (m, 2H) – perhaps two CH2 groups next to each other.

At 1.4 ppm (d, 3H) – a CH3 attached to a CH2.

At 0.9 ppm (t, 3H) – a terminal CH3, so likely part of an ethyl group.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a propyl group with a branching. Let me consider the substituent as a -CH2-CH(CH2CH3). But how does that fit into the NMR?

Wait, maybe the substituent is a sec-butyl group. Let's see: the substituent would be CH2-CH(CH2CH3)- attached to the benzene ring. Wait, no, because a sec-butyl group is (CH2)2CHCH3, but attached as -CH2-C(CH3)2?

Wait, perhaps the substituent is an isobutyl group. Isobutyl is CH2CH(CH2CH3). Hmm, but I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me try to piece the substituent together.

The NMR has a triplet at 0.9 ppm (3H), which is likely a CH3 at the end of an ethyl chain (t). The 1.4 ppm (d, 3H) could be a CH3 attached to a CH2. The 1.7 ppm (m, 2H) could be two CH2 groups. The 2.9 ppm (m, 1H) could be a CH2 connected to the benzene ring.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is -CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-CH2-? No, that doesn't make much sense. Alternatively, the substituent is a chain like CH2-CH2-CH(CH3), but I'm not quite getting it.

Wait, another approach. Let's look at the possible options:

Option A: 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid.

So the structure would be a phenyl group attached to a propanoic acid, substituting at position 4 (para) with an ethyl group. Wait, but that would make the substituent on the benzene a propanoic acid group. But the NMR shows a peak at 10.5 ppm, which is the -OH of the acid. The aromatic protons would be split into two doublets because the substituents are at para positions.

Option B: 1-isobutyl-4-methylbenzene.

That would be a toluene derivative with isobutyl and methyl groups in para positions. But that would be a di-substituted benzene. The NMR would show the aromatic protons as two doublets. But in that case, the IR wouldn't have a carbonyl peak. So this option doesn't fit the IR data.

Option C: 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid.

So the substituent is a sec-butyl group on the benzene ring, which is attached to a benzoic acid. The benzoic acid's -OH would give the 10.5 ppm peak. The substituent would be a sec-butyl group, which is CH2CH(CH2CH3) attached to the ring.

Option D: 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene.

That would be a di-substituted benzene with a sec-butyl and a methyl group. Again, no carbonyl, so the IR doesn't fit.

So, looking at the options, only options A and C have a benzoic acid group which explains the 1720 cm⁻¹ (carbonyl) and the 10.5 ppm (OH). So options B and D are probably out because they don't have a carbonyl.

Between A and C:

Option A: 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid. Wait, I'm not sure about the numbering here. Alternatively, it's a propanoic acid with the phenyl group attached to the second carbon. So the structure would be CH2-COOH attached to a phenyl group that's para-substituted with an ethyl group. The NMR would show the aromatic protons as two doublets, which matches the data. The substituents would be the COOH group and the ethyl group in the para positions.

The other option is C: 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. That would have a benzoic acid group (so the -COOH is attached to the benzene) and a sec-butyl group in the para position.

Looking at the NMR data, the substituent would have a CH2 group adjacent to the ring. Let's imagine the substituent is a sec-butyl group, which is -CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-.

Wait, the NMR for the substituent would have the following:

The 2.9 ppm (m, 1H) would be the CH group in the sec-butyl (the one attached to two CH2 groups). The 1.7 ppm (m, 2H) would be the two CH2 groups adjacent to the CH. The 1.4 ppm (d,3H) would be a CH3 attached to the CH, and the 0.9 ppm (t,3H) would be another CH3 attached to a CH2 which is part of the substituent.

Wait, but a sec-butyl group would be: -CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-. Wait, no, that's not right. A sec-butyl is -CH(CH2CH2CH3)-? No, wait: the structure of sec-butyl is CH2CH(CH2CH3), but attached to the benzene via a CH2 group. So it's benzene-CH2-CH(CH2CH3). That would mean the substituent is an ethyl group attached to a CH2, which is connected to the benzene.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a propyl group with a branch. Let's think: for the NMR, the 1.7 ppm (2H) could be two equivalent CH2 groups, perhaps in a chain. The 2.9 ppm (1H) could be a CH adjacent to the ring and to another CH2. The 1.4 ppm (3H, d) might be a CH3 attached to a CH2, and the 0.9 ppm (3H, t) is a CH3 at the end of a chain.

So, for a substituent like CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-, the NMR would show:

The CH2 (attached to benzene) would be at around 2.9 ppm (m, 1H). Wait, no, maybe the CH2 attached to the ring would be a triplet or something. Hmm, this is getting a bit complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a butyl group, let's say a branch that includes a CH2-CH2-CH(CH3), but I'm getting a bit stuck.

Wait, in the NMR, the 1.4 ppm doublet for 3H suggests that it's a CH3 attached to a CH2. This would be like a CH2-CH3 group. But the 0.9 ppm triplet (3H) suggests a terminal CH3 in an ethyl chain.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a propyl group where the middle CH is attached to another CH2 group. Let me think: the substituent could be -CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-. So the structure would be benzene-CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-COOH?

Wait, no, because the benzoic acid would be -COOH attached to the benzene. So perhaps the substituent is a sec-butyl group in the para position.

If the substituent is a sec-butyl group, then the substituent is CH2-CH(CH2CH3). So the NMR would pick up the following:

The CH2 attached to the benzene would have two protons, but perhaps the splitting is such that it shows up as a multiplet. The CH group (the one connected to two CH2s) would have one proton, showing up as a multiplet at 2.9 ppm. The adjacent CH2 (to the CH) would have two protons at 1.7 ppm. Then, the CH2CH3 would be split into a triplet at 0.9 ppm, but wait, no, the CH2CH3 is at the end of the substituent, so the CH2 would split into a quartet, but the CH3 would be a triplet. Wait, but the NMR shows a triplet for the CH3 at 0.9 ppm, which fits a -CH2CH2CH3 group. Wait, but a sec-butyl group is CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-, so the CH2 adjacent to the ring would be connected to a CH which is connected to a CH2CH3.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a isobutyl group. An isobutyl group is CH2CH(CH2CH3), no, wait, isobutyl is CH2CH(CH3)2. Hmm, no, wait, isobutyl is -CH2CH(CH3)2. So the substituent would be CH2-CH(CH3)2. In that case, the NMR would show the CH2 as a triplet (maybe around 1.4 ppm), the CH(CH3)2 as a septet? Or perhaps a multiplet around 2.9 ppm.

Wait, this is getting a bit confusing. Let me try to think about the
