Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about light moving through glass that's itself moving. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this. I remember that when objects are moving relative to each other, you have to consider things like the Doppler effect or maybe even special relativity, but wait, the question is about the speed of light in the glass from the observer's frame. 

The problem states that the light beam is propagating through a glass with index of refraction n. The glass is moving at a constant velocity v in the same direction as the beam and toward the observer. Wait, same direction as the beam and toward the observer. So the glass is moving towards me, the observer, in the same direction the light is moving. Or wait, does the beam move in the same direction as the glass's motion. Hmm, maybe I should visualize it.

So, the light is going through the glass, and the glass itself is moving. So the observer is in the lab frame, and the glass is moving at velocity v towards the observer? Wait, the problem says the glass is moving in the same direction as the beam and toward the observer. Oh, so the beam is moving towards the observer, and the glass is also moving in that same direction. So from the lab frame, the glass is moving towards the observer with velocity v, and the light is moving through the glass in that same direction.

Wait no, if the beam is propagating through the glass, and the glass is moving toward the observer. So the light is moving in the same direction as the glass's motion. So, the glass is moving towards the observer, and the light is moving in that same direction within the glass.

Wait, but the speed of light in the glass is c/n, right? Because in vacuum it's c, and the index of refraction slows it down. But how does the movement of the medium (glass) affect the speed relative to the observer?

Wait, I think this is a case where you need to use the velocity addition formula from special relativity. Because when objects are moving relative to each other, their velocities don't just add up linearly. The formula is (u + v)/(1 + (u*v)/c²), but wait, I'm a bit fuzzy on that. Oh wait, in special relativity, if you have an object moving at velocity u in a frame S, and that frame itself is moving at velocity v relative to another frame S', then the velocity in S' is (u - v)/(1 - (u v)/c²), I think
