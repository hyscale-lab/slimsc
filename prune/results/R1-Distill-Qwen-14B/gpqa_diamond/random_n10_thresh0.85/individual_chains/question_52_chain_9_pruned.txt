Okay, so I have this astronomy problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again and try to understand what's being asked.

The problem says that astronomers are studying a star with certain characteristics. The star has 1.5 solar radii and 1.1 solar masses. Without any dark spots, its effective temperature (Teff) is 6000 K. But when 40% of the surface is covered by spots, the overall Teff drops to 5500 K. 

Then the question is about the ratio of the number of neutral Ti atoms in two energy levels (level 1 and level 2) in the stellar photosphere. When the star has spots, this ratio decreases. We need to find the factor by which this ratio changes when the star doesn't have spots compared to when it does.

The transition between these levels corresponds to a wavelength of about 1448 Å, which is in the ultraviolet probably, since visible is longer. Also, it's noted that the photosphere is in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE), so I can use the Boltzmann equation for this.

Hmm. So the ratio of populations of two energy levels in LTE is given by the Boltzmann factor. The formula is n2/n1 = (g2/g1) * exp( - (E2 - E1)/(k*T) ). 

Wait, but wait. Since E = hc/λ, the energy difference can be calculated using that. Oh, right, because E2 - E1 = hc(1/λ1 - 1/λ2), but in this case, the transition is between two specific levels, so the energy difference ΔE = hc/λ, where λ is 1448 Å. But wait, wait a second, no. The energy of a photon emitted during a transition is given by ΔE = hc/λ. So the energy difference between the two levels is ΔE = hc/(λ). 

Wait, but in the Boltzmann equation, the ratio is n2/n1 = (g2/g1) exp( -ΔE/(k T) ), where ΔE is positive if E2 > E1. So, if level 2 is higher in energy than level 1, then the exponent is negative, so the ratio will be less than 1 if T is such that exp(-ΔE/(k T)) is less than 1.

Wait, but in this problem, the ratio of the number of atoms in level 1 to level 2 is being considered. Let me clarify: the ratio is n1/n2. Oh, because the question says the ratio decreases when the star has spots. Let me think.

Wait, the problem says that when the star has spots, the observed ratio (n1/n2) decreases. So without spots, the ratio is higher, and with spots, it's lower. 

Wait, but how does the temperature affect the ratio? Let's think about the Boltzmann factor. If the temperature increases, the exponent becomes less negative, so exp(-ΔE/(kT)) increases, which means n2/n1 increases. Alternatively, n1/n2 = [g1/g2] exp(ΔE/(kT)). So as T increases, exp(ΔE/(kT)) increases, making n1/n2 larger. Wait, no. Wait, let me double-check.

Wait, the Boltzmann equation is n2 = n1 (g2/g1) exp( -ΔE/(k T) ), where ΔE = E2 - E1.

So n2/n1 = (g2/g1) exp( -ΔE/(kT) )

So, when T increases, exp( -ΔE/(kT) ) increases because the denominator becomes larger, making the exponent more negative. Wait, no, because if T increases, then T is in the denominator, so the exponent becomes a smaller negative number. So exp(-x) where x is smaller. So if T increases, the exponent is less negative, so exp(-x) is larger.

Wait, let's take an example. Suppose ΔE is positive (E2 > E1). So when T is high, the denominator k T is larger, so ΔE/(k T) is smaller. So exp(-ΔE/(k T)) is larger. So n2/n1 is larger when T is higher. So when T is higher, more atoms are in the higher energy level (E2), so the ratio n2/n1 increases.

So, if the star's effective temperature is higher, the ratio n2/n1 increases, which means the ratio n1/n2 decreases.

Wait, but in our problem, when the star has spots, the overall effective temperature is lower (5500 K) compared to when it doesn't (6000 K). So when the star has spots, the Teff is lower, so the ratio n2/n1 would be lower than when the star doesn't have spots. Because with lower T, the exponential term is smaller, so n2/n1 is smaller.

Wait, but the problem states that when the star has spots, the observed ratio (n1/n2) decreases. So when the star has spots, n1/n2 is lower than when it doesn't. Wait, that would mean that when the star has spots, the temperature is lower, so the ratio n1/n2 is lower. Let me think again.

Wait, the ratio n1/n2 is equal to (g1/g2) * exp(ΔE/(k T)). So if T increases, then ΔE/(k T) decreases, so exp(ΔE/(k T)) increases? No, because ΔE is positive. So for higher T, the exponent is smaller, so exp becomes larger. So n1/n2 increases when T increases.

Wait, suppose T increases from 55
