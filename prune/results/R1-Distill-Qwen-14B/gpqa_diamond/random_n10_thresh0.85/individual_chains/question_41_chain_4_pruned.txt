Okay, so I have this physics problem here about light passing through a moving glass. Hmm, let me try to think through it step by step. I remember that when dealing with light in different media and motion, relativity might come into play, but maybe it's simpler than that.

The question says a light beam is going through glass with index of refraction n. The glass itself is moving at a constant velocity v in the same direction as the beam, towards the observer. I need to find the speed of the light relative to the lab frame.

Wait, the speed of light in a medium is generally c/n, right? So in the glass, the speed is c divided by n. But wait, here the glass is moving. Does the movement of the glass affect the speed of light inside it?

Oh, right. From what I remember, the speed of light in a medium depends on the medium's properties, not on the motion of the medium. So even if the glass is moving, the light's speed within the glass should still be c/n, because it's the medium that determines it. But wait, no, that's when the medium is stationary relative to the observer. But in this case, the glass is moving. How does that affect it?

Hmm, maybe I should think about reference frames. Let's say the glass is moving at velocity v towards the observer. The light is moving in the same direction as the glass's motion. So from the lab frame, what's the speed of the light?

Wait, another approach: in the rest frame of the glass, the light has speed c_glass = c/n. But since the glass is moving, I need to
