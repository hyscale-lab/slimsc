Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me read the question again and try to break it down.

The question is about a star with certain characteristics. The star has a radius of 1.5 solar radii and a mass of 1.1 solar masses. Without any dark spots, its effective temperature (Teff) is 6000K. But when 40% of its surface is covered by spots, the overall Teff drops to 5500 K. So, spots are making the star cooler on average.

Then there's this part about the ratio of neutral Titanium (Ti) atoms in two energy levels. The ratio decreases when the star has spots. The question is asking by what factor this ratio changes when the star isn't spotted (normal) compared to when it is spotted.

The transition between these levels is at about 1448 Å, which is in the ultraviolet range, I think. And the photosphere is in LTE (Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium), so I can use the Boltzmann equation here.

Hmm, I remember that the ratio of populations in two energy levels in LTE is given by the Boltzmann factor. The formula is n2/n1 = (g2/g1) * exp( -(E2-E1)/(k*T) ), where g is the statistical weight. Since the problem doesn't mention anything about the statistical weights changing, maybe they're the same or their ratio is 1, so the equation simplifies to n2/n1 proportional to exp( -(ΔE)/(kT) ), where ΔE is E2 - E1.

Wait, but the ratio is observed to decrease when the star has spots. That makes sense because the temperature is lower (5500 K vs 6000 K). Lower temperature would lead to lower thermal excitations, so higher energy level (E2) would have fewer atoms, so n2/n1 would decrease.

Wait, but wait: when the star is hotter, the ratio n2/n1 is higher because the exponential term is larger when T is higher. So when spots make T lower, the ratio decreases. That's consistent with the question.

The question is asking for the factor by which the ratio changes. So, when the star doesn't have spots, the ratio is higher than when it does. So the factor is (n2/n1)_normal / (n2/n1)_spotted.

Let me think about the formula. The ratio is proportional to exp(-ΔE/(k*T)), so the ratio normal (R_n) is proportional to exp(-ΔE/(k*T_n)), and the ratio spotted (R_s) is proportional to exp(-ΔE/(k*T_s)).

So the factor is R_n / R_s = [exp(-ΔE/(k T_n))] / [exp(-ΔE/(k T_s))] = exp( ΔE/(k) (1/(T_s) - 1/(T_n)) )

Wait, wait a second. Let me make sure. The exponent for R_n is -ΔE/(k T_n), and for R_s it's -ΔE/(k T_s). So R_n / R_s is exp( [ΔE/(k)] [ (1/(T_s) - 1/(T_n) ) ] )

Wait, actually, the exponents are negative, so
