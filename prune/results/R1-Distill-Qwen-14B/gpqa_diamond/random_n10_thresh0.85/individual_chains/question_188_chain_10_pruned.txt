Okay, so I've got this crystallography problem here. Let me try to figure it out step by step. Hmm, the question is about finding the interplanar distance for a (111) plane in a rhombohedral crystal. I remember that interplanar distance is calculated using a specific formula, but wait, what's the formula again?

Oh right, I think it's something like d = a / sqrt(l² + m² + n² - 2lm cos α - 2ln cos β - 2mn cos γ). Wait, no, maybe I got that wrong. Alternatively, maybe it's using the reciprocal of the lattice vectors. Oh wait, I'm mixing things up.

Wait, another thought. The interplanar distance formula for a crystal with a basis uses the plane's Miller indices (hkl) and the lattice parameters. For a cubic system, it's straightforward, but rhombohedral is more complicated because all angles are equal but not 90 degrees.

So for a rhombohedral crystal, the lattice is defined by a, a, a, but with angles alpha, beta, gamma all 30 degrees in this case. Wait no, wait the problem says it's a rhombohedral crystal, so the lattice parameters a, b, c are all equal, right? Because a rhombohedron is a special case where a = b = c, and the angles can be different, but in this case, they are all 30 degrees.

Wait no, wait. Rhombohedral means that a = b = c, but the angles can be different. Oh wait, but in this problem, all angles are 30 degrees. So it's a special case.

So the formula for interplanar distance in a rhombohedral system: I think the formula is d_hkl = (a) / sqrt( h² + k² + l² + 2(hk + hl + kl) cos ω ), but wait, no, wait. Maybe I need to think about the general case.

Another approach: The general formula for interplanar spacing in any crystal system is given by:

d_{hkl} = 1 / sqrt( (h²)/(a²) + (k²)/(b²) + (l²)/(c²) - 2 hk cos γ/(ab) - 2 hl cos β/(ac) - 2 kl cos α/(bc) ) )

Wait, but I'm getting confused. Alternatively, for a cubic system, it's simpler because a = b = c, and angles are 90 degrees. So the formula becomes d = a / sqrt(h² +k² +l²). But in rhombo
