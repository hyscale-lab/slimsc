Okay, so I'm trying to solve this astronomy problem. Let me read it carefully and break it down.

The question is about a star and how the presence of dark spots affects the ratio of neutral Titanium (Ti) atoms in two energy levels. Hmm, I remember that in stellar atmospheres, the ionization and excitation states of atoms are influenced by temperature. So when the star has spots, its overall temperature changes, which affects the ionization balance.

The star has certain parameters: 1.5 solar radius and 1.1 solar masses. When there are no spots, its effective temperature (Teff) is 6000 K. But when 40% of the surface is covered by spots, the effective temperature drops to 5500 K. So the spots are making the star cooler overall.

The problem states that the ratio of the number of neutral Ti atoms in two energy levels (level 1 and level 2) decreases when the star has spots. I need to find the factor by which this ratio changes. So without spots, the ratio is higher, and with spots, it's lower. The factor is (ratio without spots) divided by (ratio with spots).

Wait, wait. Let me clarify: the ratio is n1/n2, right? Because the question says the ratio decreases when spots are present. So when T decreases, the ratio n1/n2 decreases. So when T is higher, the ratio is higher. Because higher temperature would make more excitation, but wait, let's think about the Boltzmann equation.

The Boltzmann equation relates the number of particles in two energy states. The ratio is (n1/n2) = (g1/g2) * exp( -(E2 - E1)/(k*T) ). Since E2 > E1 (because level 2 is higher), the exponential term is exp( -ΔE/(k T) ). When T increases, the exponential term increases (because denominator is larger, so the exponent becomes a smaller negative number, making the exponential larger). So higher temperature leads to a higher ratio n1/n2. Wait, no: wait, if ΔE is positive, then as T increases, the exponent becomes less negative, so the exponential value increases. So higher T makes n1/n2 larger. So when the star has spots, T is lower, so n1/n2 ratio is lower. That's consistent with the problem statement.

So without spots, T is 6000 K. With spots, T is 5500 K. The question is about the ratio of the ratio. So (n1/n2)_no_spots / (n1/n2)_with_spots.

Let me write down the Boltzmann factor for each case.

n1/n2 = (g1/g2) * exp( -ΔE/(k T) )

Assuming that g1/g2 is the same in both cases because it's just the statistical weights, which presumably don't change. So the ratio of the ratios would be:

[ (g1/g2) exp(-ΔE/(k T1)) ] / [ (g1/g2) exp(-ΔE/(k T2)) ) ]
= exp[ (ΔE/k)(1/T1 - 1/T2) ) ]

Wait, wait. Wait, T1 is 6000 K, T2 is 5500 K. So the exponent is (ΔE/k) * (1/6000 - 1/5500).

Wait, but wait: the denominator would be (1/T2 - 1/T1) because when you subtract the exponents, you get exp(a) / exp(b) = exp(a - b). Let me be precise.

(n1/n2)_no_spots = (g1/g2) * exp( -ΔE/(k T1) )
(n1/n2)_with_spots = (g1/g2) * exp( -ΔE/(k T2) )

So the ratio is:

[ (g1/g2) exp( -ΔE/(k T1) ) ] / [ (g1/g2) exp( -ΔE/(k T2) ) ) ]
= exp( (ΔE/(k)) (1/(T2) - 1/(T1)) ) )

Wait, let me see:

exp( -ΔE/(k T1) ) / exp( -ΔE/(k T2) ) ) = exp[ (-ΔE/(k T1) ) + (ΔE/(k T2) )) ]
= exp[ ΔE/(k) (1/(T2) - 1/(T1)) ) ]

Wait, no: because a/b is a * (1/b), and exponents add. So (-a) - (-b) = b - a. So yes, that's correct.

So the ratio is exp[ (ΔE/k) (1/T2 - 1/T1) ]

But wait, let's plug in the numbers.

Wait, the transition is at 1448 Å. Hmm, that's in the near-ultraviolet or visible? Let me see, 1448 Å is about 0.1448 microns, which is in the near UV. So the energy of the photon would be E = hc/λ. But wait, the energy difference between the two levels is ΔE = hc/λ.

Wait, but in the Boltzmann equation, it's the energy difference between the two states. So ΔE = E2 - E1 = hc / λ.

So ΔE = hc /λ.

Wait, but wait, let me make sure. The transition wavelength corresponds to the energy difference between the two levels. So E2 - E1 = hc/λ.

So yes, ΔE = hc/λ.

So substituting into the exponent:

(ΔE/k) (1/T2 - 1/T1) = (hc/(λ k)) (1/T2 - 1/T1 )

So let's compute this.

Constants:

h = Planck's constant = 6.626e-34 J·s
c = speed of light = 3e8 m/s
k = Boltzmann constant = 1.38e-23 J/K
λ = 1448 Å = 1448e-10 m = 1.448e-7 m.

T1 = 6000 K
T2 = 5500 K

So compute (1/T2 - 1/T1) = (1/5500 - 1/6000) = (6000 - 5500) / (5500 * 6000) ) = 500 / (33,000,000) = 5/(330,000) ≈ 1.515e-5 1/K.

Wait, let me compute that again.

1/5500 ≈ 1.818e-4 K^-1
1/6000 ≈ 1.6667e-4 K^-1
Difference is (1.818e-4 - 1.6667e-4) = 0.1513e-4 = 1.513e-5 K^-1.

So (1/T2 - 1/T1) = 1.513e-5 K^-1.

Now, compute (hc)/(λk):

h c = 6.626e-34 * 3e8 = 1.9878e-25 J·m.

λ k = 1.448e-7 m * 1.38e-23 J/K = 2.00e-30 J·m.

Wait, let me calculate it step by step.

hc = 6.626e-34 * 3e8 = 1.9878e-25 J·m (since J = kg·m²/s², so J·m is kg·m³/s²).

λk = 1.448e-7 m * 1.38e-23 J/K = ?

1.448e-7 * 1.38e-23 = approx (1.448 * 1.38) * 1e-30.

1.448 * 1.38 ≈ 2.00
