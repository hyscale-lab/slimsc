Okay, so I'm trying to solve this physics problem about the speed of light in a moving glass medium. Hmm, let me read the question again. 

The problem states that a light beam is propagating through glass with index of refraction n. The glass itself is moving at a constant velocity v in the same direction as the beam and towards the observer in the lab. The question is asking what the speed of light in the glass is relative to the observer.

Wait, I remember that the speed of light in a medium depends on the medium's properties. Normally, the speed v of light in a medium is c divided by the refractive index n. So in this case, without any movement, the speed would be c/n. But since the glass is moving, maybe there's some addition of velocities involved?

I think about special relativity here. Oh wait, but glass is a material, not a vacuum. So perhaps the motion of the medium affects the observed speed. Or maybe it's a matter of relative velocities.

Wait, the glass is moving towards the observer at velocity v. The light beam is going in the same direction as the glass's motion. So from the lab frame, the glass is moving towards us, and the light is moving with the glass in the same direction as the beam. 

Hmm, I'm a bit confused. Let me think step by step. 

In the rest frame of the glass, the light speed is c/n. But since the glass is moving, we have to consider the transformation of velocities. So perhaps I need to use the velocity addition formula from special relativity. 

The velocity addition formula in special relativity is u' = (u + v) / (1 + (u*v)/cÂ²). Wait, but here u is
