Okay, so I'm trying to figure out which planet has a higher probability of transiting. Hmm, I remember that the transit method relies on the planet passing in front of its star from our point of view, which causes a dip in brightness. The probability of this happening depends on the size of the planet relative to the star and the alignment of the orbit.

Wait, so the probability of a transit is higher when the star is smaller and the planet's orbit is more likely to align with our line of sight. Oh right, the formula for the transit probability is something like (R_planet / R_star)^2 multiplied by (a / (R_star + a)), or maybe it's (R_star + R_planet / a), I'm a bit confused. Let me think. Oh wait, I think the approximate probability is proportional to (R_p / R_s)^2 multiplied by (1 / a), but wait, noâ€”I think the exact formula is more involved. Alternatively, I remember that the probability is given by (R_p + R_s) / a, but perhaps I'm mixing up terms.

Wait, no. Another approach: the transit probability is the ratio of the area of the star's disk to the area of the planet's orbital path as seen from Earth. So the probability is roughly (R_star + R_planet)^2 / (a^2 * (1 - e^2)), but since the orbits are circular, e=0, so it's just (R_star + R_planet)^2 / a^2. Wait, but I think that's the area of the planet's disk compared to the star's disk, but I'm not so sure.

Wait, more accurately, the transit probability is the ratio of the area of the planet's disk to the area of the star's disk, multiplied by the probability that the orbital plane is aligned. But alignment is a factor. The probability that the planet's orbit is aligned such that it transits is approximately (R_star / a)^2 multiplied by some factor. Wait, no, I'm getting a bit muddled here.

Let me try to get the correct formula. The transit probability P is given by (R_p / a)^2 * (1 / (sin i)), where i is the inclination of the orbit. But since we're considering all possible inclinations, the average probability is the average of this over all possible i. Wait, but in reality, the probability depends on the alignment. So for random orientations, the probability that the planet transits is
