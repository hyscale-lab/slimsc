Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem to solve. Let me try to work through it step by step. I'm a bit new to this, but I'll do my best.

The question is about identifying an unknown compound using its spectroscopic data. The options are different chemical formulas, so I need to figure out which one fits the given data.

First, let's look at the FTIR data. It says there's a very broad absorption at 3000 cm^-1. I remember that broad peaks around there usually indicate O-H stretching, like in alcohols or maybe carboxylic acids. But wait, carboxylic acid O-H is usually broader and around 2500-3300. So maybe it's an alcohol or a carboxylic acid.

Then, there are strong peaks at 1700 and 1650 cm^-1. The 1700 is a strong peak, which could be a carbonyl group, like a ketone, aldehyde, or maybe an ester. The 1650 I'm not exactly sure. Could it be an aromatic ring (like C=C stretching) or maybe another carbonyl? Wait, 1650 is a bit lower than 1700. Maybe that's an conjugated carbonyl group or perhaps an amide? But the options don't include nitrogen, so maybe it's something else. Alternatively, an ester or a conjugated carbonyl, like an alpha,beta-unsaturated ketone or ester.

Next, the 1H NMR shows peaks for vinyl hydrogens. Vinyl hydrogens are the ones on a double bond, so that suggests there's an alkene or maybe an aromatic ring. Wait, aromatic protons can sometimes show up differently, depending on substitution. But in this case, since it's specifically mentioned as vinyl, maybe it's an alkene.

Looking at the mass spectrum, the fragment peak is at m/z = 45. Hmm. I remember that m/z 45 is a common fragment, like maybe from a ketone or another group. For example, (CH3)2CO (acetone) would have a fragment at 45, but not sure. Another possibility is the CH2=CH- group, but that's more like 28 or 29. Alternatively, maybe a carbonyl cleavage? Like in an ester, the loss of a fragment could lead to that.

Now, let's look at the possible formulas:

Options are:
A) C6H12O2
B) C6H10O
C) C6H10O2
D) C6H12O

So, each of these has different degrees of unsaturation. The degree of unsaturation (DoU) is calculated as (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. Since there's no X or N, it's (2C +2 - H)/2.

For each option:

Option A: C=6, H=12, O=2. DoU = (2*6 +2 -12)/2 = (14-12)/2=1. So one ring or double bond. But wait, does O affect this? No, because O is excluded. So DoU is 1.

But wait, the NMR has vinyl hydrogens, which implies a double bond. So DoU should be at least 1. But if the IR has a carbonyl (which counts as a double bond), that's another DoU. Let me think again.

Wait, the DoU for each compound:

A) C6H12O2: DoU = (14 -12)/2 = 1. So one double bond or ring.

But wait, if the molecule has a carbonyl (C=O) that's one DoU, and a double bond (alkene) that's another, that would make two. So unless there's a ring and a double bond, or two double bonds, but the DoU for option A is 1, which can't account for both. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake.

Let me recalculate correctly. The formula is CnHmOp. So DoU is (2n +2 - m - p)/2. Wait, wait, no. The general formula is DoU = (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. Since O doesn't count here, and X and N are zero in this case.

So DoU = (2*6 +2 - H)/2.

Option A: H=12. So (14-12)/2=1. So one DoU. But the molecule has a carbonyl (DoU 1) and a double bond (DoU 1), which would be two DoU. So this would require DoU=2, but option A only allows 1. So this suggests that maybe I'm misinterpreting something.

Wait, maybe the carbonyl is part of a ring? Alternatively, perhaps it's an ester group. Let me think more.

If option A is C6H12O2, possible structures might be something like an ester, which has a carbonyl and an ether linkage. But wait, esters have two oxygen atoms. So that fits. The structure could be something like methyl cyclohexanoate or similar. But then, are there double bonds? The NMR shows vinyl hydrogens, so yes, a double bond.

Wait, maybe the molecule is a cyclic ester, but that's a lactone. Alternatively, maybe it's an ester with an alkene.

But the DoU issue is confusing. Let me check all the options.

Option B: C6H10O. DoU = (14-10)/2=2. So two DoU. That could be one ring and one double bond, or two double bonds, etc.

Option C: C6H10O2. DoU=(14-10)/2=2. Two DoU.

Option D: C6H12O. DoU=(14-12)/2=1. Only one DoU.

So, from the NMR data, the presence of vinyl hydrogens suggests at least one double bond, so DoU must be at least 1. The FTIR shows a carbonyl (another DoU), so the total DoU should be at least 2. Hence, options A and D, which have DoU=1, can't be right. So we can eliminate options A and D, leaving B and C.

So possible options are B: C6H10O and C: C6H10O2.

Now, let's think about the IR. The strong peak at 1700 cm^-1 suggests a carbonyl. The peak at 1650 could be conjugated with something, perhaps an ester (which has a carbonyl around 1700 and an adjacent O that could cause a shift). Alternatively, maybe it's an aromatic ring with conjugation.

But wait, in an ester, the carbonyl is around 1720-1740 cm^-1. Wait, but the peak here is at 1700. Hmm, could be a ketone, which is around 1700. Alternatively, maybe an ester but with some conjugation.

Wait, the 1650 peak might be an ester's conjugated carbonyl or perhaps an aromatic ring. But other possibilities: an alpha,beta-unsaturated carbonyl would have a carbonyl around 1700 and a conjugated double bond, which might show a peak around 1650 for the C=C.

So if the structure is an aromatic ring with a carbonyl group, but that's more complicated. Alternatively, maybe it's a cyclic ester or lactone.

Wait, but the other thing from IR is the broad peak at 3000. That's probably O-H from an alcohol or perhaps an ester (if it's an acidic O-H). But wait, in an ester, the O-H is not present because it's part of an ester group (R-O-CO-O-R?), no, wait, no. Esters are R-O-CO-O-R? No, wait, no. Wait, no, esters are R-O-CO-R', so the oxygen is part of the ester group but not an -OH. So if the broad peak is at 3000, that suggests an -OH group. So perhaps an alcohol or maybe a carboxylic acid.

But wait, if it's a carboxylic acid, the O-H would be very broad, which fits. But the FTIR also has a carbonyl at 1700. A carboxylic acid's carbonyl is around 1700 cm^-1. But wait, the FTIR also has a peak at 1650, which I'm not sure about.

Alternatively, maybe it's an alcohol with a carbonyl group, like a ketone. But the broad O-H would be an alcohol. So let's think about this.

Looking at the options, option B is C6H10O. That's a benzene ring with one substituent, perhaps. Wait, C6H10O: Benzene (C6H6) plus something. Let's see, benzene is C6H6. If it has an O and a double bond, perhaps a phenol or an alkoxy group.

But then, the NMR has vinyl hydrogens, which are CH2=CH- type. Wait, maybe the compound is cyclohexene with a substituent. Alternatively, maybe a di-substituted benzene with an OH group.

Alternatively, maybe it's a cyclic ether, but that might not have the O-H stretch.

Wait, but the broad peak at 3000 is O-H. So it's either an alcohol or a carboxylic acid. But carboxylic acids have higher molecular weight, but the options include O2 in some cases.

Wait, another approach: the mass spectrum has a peak at m/z=45. Common fragment would be (CH3)2CO, which would have a m/z of 45, but wait, acetone is (CH3)2CO, which is C3H6O. Its molecular ion is 58. But in the mass spec, the fragment at 45 could be a fragment of the unknown compound.

What gives m/z=45? Let's think: the molecular formula of the fragment would be C3H6O (because 3*12 +6 +16=3*12=36, 6=6, 16=16 â†’ 36+6=42 +16=58? Hmm, wait, no. Maybe it's a different group. Wait, let's compute the possible fragments. 45 is 45 g/mol.

Possible fragments:

- C3H7O+ (if that's possible?), but 3*12 +7 +16=36+7=43 +16=59. No.

Wait, maybe it's C2H5O+? 2*12=24 +5+16= 24+5=29+16=45. Oh, yes. So (C2H5O)+ would be 45. How is that possible? The fragment could be from a ketone, perhaps, like if a molecule breaks at the carbonyl group. Wait, for example, if the molecule is an ester, maybe the ester oxygen is connected to a CH2 group, which could cleave.

Alternatively, another possibility: the fragment could be from a carboxylic acid, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, acetate would be (CH3COO-). Wait, but acetate is 60 (C2H3O2^-), but in positive ions, perhaps it's different.

Wait, another fragment could be from a vinyl group. If the molecule has a CH2=CH-O- group, perhaps the fragment is CH2=CH-O.

Wait, but that would have a molecular weight of 45 as well: C2H3O. Let me calculate: 2*12=24 +3=27 +16=43? No, 24+3=27, plus 16 is 43. Wait, but the peak is at 45. Hmm.

Wait, another possibility: a ketene group? Not sure. Or perhaps it's a methoxy group attached to something. Wait, methoxy is 31 (OCH3), but the fragment is 45, so perhaps a larger fragment.

Wait, maybe the fragment is from a six-membered ring breaking. Let me think about the options.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecular formula is C6H10O2. Let's think about possible structures. For example, methyl cyclopentanoate would be C6H10O2. The structure would be an ester, with a cyclopentane ring and an ester group. But would that produce a fragment at 45?

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule is a di-substituted ester, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach: let's think about the molecular formulas. The correct answer is either B or C.

Option B: C6H10O. The molecular formula is C6H10O, which would have a molecular weight of (6*12) +10 +16=72+10=82+16=98 g/mol.

Option C: C6H10O2. Molecular weight is 6*12=72 +10=82 +32=114.

So in the mass spec, the molecular ion would be at 98 or 114. The question says there is a fragment at 45, so that would be a significant fragment.

If the molecular formula is C6H10O2, perhaps the molecule is an ester, like methyl cyclopentanoate (which is C6H10O2). How would that fragment? The ester group could cleave, producing a fragment with the R-O- part. Alternatively, the ester could break into a carbonyl and an alcohol.

Wait, if the ester is R-O-CO-R', then upon cleavage, perhaps the R-O- group would break off. Let's say R is CH2CH2 (but that's not likely). Alternatively, maybe it's a cyclic ester, a lactone. For example, a five-membered ring would be a gamma-lactone, which might break into a smaller fragment.

But I'm not entirely sure. Let me think about the possible structures again.

So from the NMR: vinyl hydrogens, so likely an alkene or maybe an aromatic ring (but 'vinyl' suggests a double bond in a chain). The presence of vinyl H would be in a CH2=CH- group, perhaps. So maybe the compound has a double bond and an ester group.

Wait, if the compound is methyl vinyl ketone, but that's C4H6O. Not matching the options. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the compound is cyclohexene with an ester substituent. But I'm not sure.

Let me think about the IR again. The 1700 cm^-1 peak is a strong carbonyl. The 1650 could be a conjugated double bond, perhaps an alpha,beta-unsaturated ester. So the structure could be something like CH2=CHCOOR, but wait, that would be a conjugated system. The carbonyl would be around 1700, and the C=C around 1650.

So in that case, the structure would have a conjugated double bond and a carbonyl. That would explain the IR peaks. Also, the presence of vinyl H in the NMR.

If the structure is an alpha,beta-unsaturated ester, like CH2=CHCOOCH2CH2CH2CH3, but that's more than 6 carbons. Wait, but perhaps it's a cyclic ester. Like a substituted cyclohexene with an ester group.

Alternatively, maybe it's a substituted cyclopentene with an ester substituent.

Now, the molecular formula for option C is C6H10O2. Let's calculate the degrees of unsaturation: DoU = (2*6 +2 -10)/2 = (14-10)/2 = 2. So two degrees. Which could be one ring and one double bond, or two double bonds, etc.

So if the structure has a ring and a double bond, that fits.

So putting it all together: the IR shows a broad O-H (probably an alcohol or maybe a carboxylic acid), but wait, if it's an ester, there's no O-H. So that's confusing. Because the O-H would be from an alcohol group, but if the structure is an ester, then where is the O-H?

Wait, perhaps the FTIR peaks are from something else. Let me think again. The FTIR has a broad peak at 3000 cm^-1, which is O-H. So that suggests an alcohol group. But the ester doesn't have an O-H. So maybe it's a hemiacetal or something else.

Wait, another possibility: maybe the compound is a diol or something with two O-H groups. But the options don't include O higher than 2.

Alternatively, perhaps the broad peak is not O-H but an N-H. But the options don't include nitrogen, so that's not possible.

Hmm. Maybe it's a cyclic ether with some substituent, but that doesn't fit with the O-H stretch. Alternatively, perhaps it's a phenol. Phenol has a broad O-H peak.

So, if the compound is a phenol, the structure would have a benzene ring with an -OH group. But the NMR has vinyl H, which would imply a double bond outside the ring. So, perhaps a vinyl group attached to a phenol.

But the options are C6H10O or C6H10O2. Let's see. Phenol is C6H5OH, which is C6H6O. So if the structure is C6H5CH2CH2OH, that's C8H10O. Doesn't match our options. Alternatively, maybe a substituted phenol with a double bond.

Wait, another approach: the presence of O-H suggests an alcohol or phenol. The presence of a carbonyl (IR at 1700) suggests a ketone, aldehyde, ester, or maybe a conjugated carbonyl.

So let's consider option C: C6H10O2. If the structure is an ester and an alcohol, that would require two oxygen atoms. But esters are R-O-CO-R', which have two O's in the ester group. So if the molecule is an ester, there's only one O-H group elsewhere. But that might complicate the structure.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is a diester, but that might be less likely with this molecular formula.

Wait, perhaps the compound is a cyclic ester, a lactone. So a lactone is a cyclic ester. For example, a five-membered ring (gamma-lactone) would have a structure like (CH2)3COO in a ring. So, the structure would be a ring with a ketone and an ester-like structure. But I'm not exactly sure.

If the compound is a lactone, the molecular formula would be C6H10O2. Does that fit? Let's see: a six-membered ring would have a carbonyl and an oxygen. For example, a delta-lactone (six-membered ring), which would have the formula C5H8O2. Hmm, but we have C6H10O2, so perhaps a different structure.

Alternatively, maybe a substituted cyclic ester with more carbons. I'm not entirely sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure isn't a lactone but an ester with a vinyl group. For example, something like CH2=CHCOOR, but the molecular formula would be different.

Wait, another thought: the mass fragment at 45 could be from a CH3COO group. The fragment would be (CH3COO)+ which is 60, but that's higher than 45. Hmm.

Wait, another possibility: the fragment is the methyl group attached to the ester. For example, if the ester is OCH2CH3, then the fragment could be (CH2CH3O)+, which would be 45. Let's see: CH2CH3O is (12*2) + (3*1) + 16= 24 +3 +16=43. No, that's 43. Hmm.

Wait, the formula for the fragment would need to sum to 45. Let me think of possible fragments.

Another possibility is the loss of a water molecule from the compound. If the molecular ion is at 114 (for option C), losing 18 would give 96. Not helpful.

Alternatively, the fragment could be a ketene group, but I don't think that's common.

Wait, another approach: the presence of a carbonyl group in the IR suggests that the molecule has a carbonyl. So the possible functional groups are:

- Ketone
- Aldehyde
- Ester
- Amide (unlikely, no N)
- Carboxylic acid
- Anhydride (unlikely, as that would require more O)
- Conjugated carbonyl (like in an alpha,beta-unsaturated compound)

The presence of a broad O-H suggests it's either an alcohol, phenol, or carboxylic acid.

So, considering the options, let's see which formula fits.

If the structure is a carboxylic acid, the formula would have an -OH and a carbonyl. For example, for C6H10O2, the formula could be HOOC-C5H9. But wait, that would be HOOC-C5H9, which is HOOC-C5H9. The molecular formula would be C6H12O2. But our option C is C6H10O2, which has two fewer hydrogens. So maybe a ring structure.

Alternatively, the structure could be a cyclic ester (lactone) with a double bond. For example, a six-membered ring with a ketone and an ester group, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is a di-substituted benzene with an ester group and an alcohol. But I'm not sure.

Hmm, this is getting a bit tangled. Let me try to think of each option.

Option B: C6H10O. So the formula is C6H10O. Degrees of unsaturation: 2 (DoU=2). So two rings, one ring and one double bond, or two double bonds.

If it's a benzene ring, which has three DoU (from the ring plus three double bonds), but benzene is C6H6. So this compound is C6H10O, which is more saturated than benzene. So perhaps a substituted cyclohexene with an alcohol group.

For example, cyclohexene with an -OH substituent: that would have a ring (DoU 1) and a double bond (DoU 1), so total 2. Fits.

In this case, the FTIR would show the O-H from the alcohol (3000 cm^-1), the carbonyl would need to come from where? Wait, wait, the IR shows a peak at 1700 cm^-1, which is a carbonyl. So if the structure is cyclohexene with an -OH group, where is the carbonyl?

Wait, that doesn't fit. So perhaps the compound isn't B.

Alternatively, maybe a di-substituted cyclohexene with an ester group. But then the formula would have two O's.

Wait, perhaps I'm confusing the options. Let's go back.

Another approach: the vinyl H in NMR suggests a CH2=CH- group. So the molecule likely has a vinyl group.

The carbonyl at 1700 cm^-1 could be a ketone. So perhaps the structure is a cyclohexene with a ketone group and an alcohol.

Wait, but the formula for that would be C6H10O2: a cyclohexene (which is C6H10) with a ketone (O) and an OH (another O), leading to C6H10O2. That would be option C.

But then the IR would have a strong absorption at 1700 (ketone), and perhaps the 1650 is the C=C from the cyclohexene.

So the structure would be a cyclohexenone with an alcohol group. But wait, that would require two oxygen atoms. So the formula would be C6H10O2, which is option C.

But wait, in that case, where is the O-H group? The FTIR shows a broad peak, which would be from the alcohol.

So the structure could be something like cyclohexenol with a ketone. But that's a bit complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a di-substituted cyclohexene with an ester group. Wait, but the formula would then require two O's (ester has two O's), and the presence of a vinyl group. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is a cyclic ester (lactone) with a double bond. So for example, a gamma-lactone with a double bond. The molecular formula would be C6H10O2. Let me see: a five-membered ring would have four carbons from the ester and one from the carbonyl. Wait, maybe a six-membered ring.

Let me think of the structure: imagine a cyclopentane ring with an ester group. Wait, but that's getting a bit complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is an ester with a vinyl group. Like CH2=CHCOOR. Let's calculate the formula for that. CH2=CHCOO- is C3H4O2. If R is, say, CH2CH2CH3 (but that would make it longer). Alternatively, R could be methyl, making the ester CH2=CHCOOCH3, which is C5H8O2. But our options are for six carbons. So perhaps it's a different structure.

Wait, another thought: the molecular formula is C6H10O2. The mass fragment at 45 could be (CH2CH2O)+ but that's 43. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe the fragment is from the ester group. If the ester is, say, CH2=CHCOOCH2CH2CH3, but that's 8 carbons. Not matching.

Alternatively, maybe the ester is part of a six-membered ring, leading to a fragment that breaks off into a smaller piece.

But I'm not getting much further with this. Let me try to think of each option and their possible IR and NMR.

Option C: C6H10O2. Possible structure: methyl cyclopentanoate. That's an ester, so no O-H group. But the FTIR shows a broad O-H peak, which would not fit an ester. So maybe that's not correct.

Wait, but earlier I thought the O-H is present. So if the structure is an ester, there's no O-H. So that would contradict the FTIR data. Therefore, option C can't be correct? Because it's an ester, no O-H.

But the FTIR shows a broad O-H peak, so the compound must have an O-H group. So maybe option C isn't correct. Then, which other option has O-H and a carbonyl?

Looking back, option B is C6H10O. It has one O. So possible functional groups: alcohol, ketone, aldehyde, etc.

If the structure is a cyclohexene with a ketone and an alcohol group, that would require two O's, but option B has one O. So that's not possible.

Hmm, this is getting a bit tricky.

Wait, another angle: the IR peak at 1700 suggests a carbonyl. So, if the compound is an alcohol with a ketone group, that would require two O's, making the formula C6H10O2 (option C). But then, the O-H would be present, which would match the broad IR peak.

So the structure would have both a ketone (carbonyl) and an alcohol (-OH). So for option C, the formula is C6H10O2, which allows two O's for these groups.

So the structure could be a cyclohexenol with a ketone group. For example, a cyclohexene ring with a hydroxyl group and a ketone. But that would require a specific arrangement.

Alternatively, maybe it's a substituted cyclopropane or something else, but I'm not sure.

In that case, the NMR would show the vinyl H as part of
