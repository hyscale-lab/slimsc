Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to work through it. Let's see what the question is about.

The question is about a meson resonance, X. We need to find the mean decay distance. The given parameters are the production energy E_X = 8 GeV, mass m_X = 1.2 GeV, and width Γ_X = 320 MeV. The options are A to D, each with a specific value.

Hmm, I remember that the mean decay distance (or proper mean lifetime) for a particle is related to its lifetime, which depends on its width. The formula I think is something like c times tau, where c is the speed of light, and tau is the lifetime. But wait, how do I get tau from the width?

Oh right, the uncertainty principle! The width Γ is related to the lifetime τ by Γ = ħ / τ. So, τ = ħ / Γ. Then, the mean decay distance L is c * τ, which would be c * (ħ / Γ). Oh wait, but wait—L is the product of the speed of light and the lifetime, so L = cτ = c*(ħ/Γ). Hmm, but wait, I'm not so sure. Let me think again.

Wait, actually, the decay width Γ is related to the mean lifetime τ by Γ = ħ * (1/τ). So, τ = ħ/(Γ). So, the lifetime is inversely proportional to the width. But wait, I might have mixed up the formula. Another thought: for a resonance, the decay width Γ is the total decay rate, and the lifetime is τ = ħ / Γ. So yes, that's correct.

But wait, I also remember that in particle physics, the width is often given in energy units (like MeV), so when using natural units where ħ = c = 1, the lifetime is just Γ^-1. But when converting to meters, we need to bring in the constants.

So, let's break it down. The steps are:

1. Calculate the lifetime τ using τ = ħ / Γ.
2. Then, the mean decay distance L is c * τ.

Wait, no, wait. Wait, the proper lifetime is τ, so the mean path length would be L = β c τ. Oh, right! Because if a particle is moving at velocity v, which is βc, then the distance it travels before decaying is L = v * τ. But wait, wait—if the particle is at rest, then L = c
