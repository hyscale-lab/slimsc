Okay, so I've got this question about neutrino flux from the Sun. Let me try to work through it. Hmm, the question says that the pp-III branch suddenly stopped in the Sun's core about 8 and a half minutes ago. I need to find the ratio of the flux between two energy bands: 700-800 keV (band 1) and 800-900 keV (band 2). So, flux1 over flux2.

Wait, first, I should remember what the pp-III branch is. From what I recall, the proton-proton chain, which is the main source of the Sun's energy, has several branches. The pp-I branch is the main one, and pp-II and pp-III are less significant. Oh wait, no, I think the main proton-proton chain is pp-I, then pp-II and pp-III are variations. Or maybe pp-III is a specific part of the chain. Oh right, the pp-III branch involves the 3He burning, right? So, the pp-III branch is when two 3He nuclei fuse into a 4He and two protons. That's part of the cycle that produces neutrinos.

So the question is stopping the pp-III branch. So if it stops, what happens to the neutrino flux? Well, solar neutrinos are produced mainly via the proton-proton chain, and in particular, the pp-III branch is a major source for a certain type of neutrino. I think the pp-III branch produces the 7Be neutrinos, which are a significant part of the solar neutrino flux. Wait, or is that the pp-I branch? I'm a bit confused. Let me think: the pp-I branch produces 2H (deuterium), then in the next steps, it leads to 3H (tritium), which then captures a proton to make 4He, producing a neutrino. The pp-II branch involves a different path where a proton captures a 5Li7 nucleus to make 6Be8, but I'm not sure about the neutrinos from that. The pp-III branch is where two 3He nuclei combine into 4He and two protons, and that likely emits a neutrino in the process.

Wait, another thought. The main neutrino emission in the Sun comes from two processes: the dominant one is the pp-I branch, which produces a neutrino when 3H (tritium) captures a proton to become 4He. Then, the other significant source is the pp-III branch, which emits a neutrino each time two 3He nuclei combine. So if the pp-III branch stops, then the neutrinos from that process would stop as well.

But how does that affect the energy bands of the neutrinos? Because neutrinos have a range of energies depending on the process. I think the pp-III neutrinos have a higher energy than the pp-I neutrinos. Or wait, maybe the opposite. Let me think: the pp-I process emits a neutrino with an energy around 0.5 MeV or so, while the pp-III neutrinos are higher energy, maybe around 1-2 MeV? Or wait, maybe it's the other way around. No, I'm getting a bit mixed up. Let me think about the specifics.

Oh wait, the Sun's neutrino flux is composed mainly of neutrinos from the proton-proton chain. The dominant process is the pp-I branch, which emits neutrinos with energies around a few hundred keV. The pp-III branch produces higher-energy neutrinos, perhaps in the range of 800 keV and above. So if the pp-III branch stops, the higher-energy neutrinos would stop, but the lower-energy ones from pp-I would still be present.

Wait, but the question is about two specific bands: 700-800 keV (band 1) and 800-900 keV (band 2). So if the pp-III branch is responsible for the higher-energy neutrinos, then stopping it would reduce the flux in band 2. But what about band 1?

Wait, the pp-I neutrinos are lower energy. Let me see: the pp-I neutrinos have energies in the range of about 0.4 MeV (400 keV) up to around 1.4 MeV, but I'm not entirely certain. Wait, no, I think the main neutrinos from the pp-I process are about 0.5 MeV, but there's a spread. The pp-III neutrinos are higher, perhaps in the 1-2 MeV range.

Wait, another approach: the solar neutrinos are detected in experiments, and the energy spectrum is a superposition of different sources. The main source is the pp-I neutrinos, which are around 0.5 MeV, but the pp-III neutrinos are higher energy, maybe around 1 MeV or so. Oh wait, but if the pp-III neutrinos are stopped, then the higher energy part of the neutrino flux would drop.

So, the question is about the flux ratio between two bands. Let's say that the pp-III branch was responsible for a significant fraction of the neutrinos in band 2 (800-900 keV). If the pp-III stops, band 2's flux would drop. What about band 1 (700-800 keV)? Are these neutrinos from the pp-I branch?

So, the pp-I neutrinos have a spectrum that extends up to around 1.4 MeV, but their average energy is about 0.5 MeV. So, there would be some pp-I neutrinos in band 1 and in band 2. So if the pp-III branch is stopped, which contributes to the higher end of band 2, the flux in band 2 would drop more significantly than band 1, which is still being contributed by the pp-I branch.

Wait, but the question says that the pp-III branch stopped 8.5 minutes ago. The neutrinos travel at
