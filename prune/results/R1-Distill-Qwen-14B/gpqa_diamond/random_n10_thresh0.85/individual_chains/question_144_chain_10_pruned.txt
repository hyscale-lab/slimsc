Okay, so I have this physics problem here about a meson resonance and its mean decay distance. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on particle physics, but let me try to think this through.

The question gives me the production energy E_X = 8 GeV, mass m_X = 1.2 GeV, and width Γ_X = 320 MeV. I need to find the mean decay distance. The options are all in the order of 10^-15 or 10^-16 meters, so it's a very small distance, which makes sense for particles decaying quickly.

I remember that the mean decay distance is related to the particle's lifetime and velocity. The formula I think is something like distance L = gamma * beta * c * tau, where gamma is the Lorentz factor, beta is v/c, c is the speed of light, and tau is the proper lifetime.

Wait, but how do I find tau? Oh right, the width Γ is related to the lifetime. The uncertainty principle says Γ = ħ / tau, so tau is ħ / Γ. But wait, I should double-check the exact relationship. Oh right, Γ is the total decay width, and the mean lifetime tau is inverse of the width divided by ħ. So tau = ħ / Γ.

Wait, actually, the relation is Γ = ħ / tau, so tau = ħ/(Γ). Because Γ is the energy width, which is ħ multiplied by the inverse of the lifetime. So tau is ħ divided by Γ.

So first, I need to compute the lifetime tau. Then, compute the velocity beta and gamma, which depends on the energy and mass.

Wait, another approach: For a particle, the mean lifetime observed in the lab frame (the dilated lifetime) is gamma * tau. Because tau is the proper lifetime, and time dilation makes it longer. Oh wait, no, wait: proper time is the shortest time, so the lab frame sees a longer time (gamma * tau). So the actual lifetime as seen in the lab is gamma multiplied by the proper lifetime.

Wait, but when considering decay length, the lifetime in the lab frame is gamma * tau, and the velocity is beta c, so the distance is (gamma tau) * (beta c).

So that's correct. So L = gamma * beta * c * tau.

But alternatively, since gamma is E/(m c^2), and beta is sqrt(1 - (1/gamma^2)), but maybe I can find gamma using E and m.

Wait, the energy E is given as 8 GeV. The mass is 1.2 GeV. So the total energy E is gamma m c^2. So gamma = E/(m c^2). Wait, actually, units have to be consistent. Let me think in terms of natural units perhaps, but let me get the units straight.

Wait, in particle physics, energies are often given in GeV, masses in GeV/c². So E = gamma m c². Therefore, gamma is E/(m c²) in units where c is not 1. Wait, but when using E in GeV, m in GeV/c², then E = gamma m c². So dividing both sides by m c² gives gamma = E/(m c²). But wait, in terms of units, let me think: If E is in GeV, m is in GeV/c², so E/(m c²) would be (GeV) / (GeV/c² * c²) ) = GeV / GeV = dimensionless, which is correct for gamma.

So, gamma = E/(m c²). Plugging in the numbers: E is 8 GeV, m is 1.2 GeV/c². So gamma = 8 / 1.2 = 6.666... approximately. So gamma is 6.6667.

Next, beta is sqrt(1 - 1/gamma²). Let's compute that. Gamma is 6.6667, so 1/gamma² is (1/6.6667)^2 = (0.15)^2 = 0.0225. So 1 - 0.0225 = 0.9775. Square root of that is sqrt(0.9775) ≈ 0.9887. So beta is approximately 0.9887.

But wait, perhaps I should compute it more accurately. Let's compute 1/gamma^2: 1/( (8/1.2) )^2 = (1.2/8)^2 = (0.15)^2 = 0.0225. So 1 - 0.0225 is 0.9775. Square root: sqrt(0.9775). Let me do that calculation. Hmm, sqrt(0.9775) is approximately 0.9887. So beta is around 0.9887.

Alternatively, perhaps I can compute it as beta = sqrt(1 - (m^2 c^4)/(E^2)) ). Wait, that's another formula. Since E = gamma m c^2, so m c² = E / gamma. So (m c²)^2 = (E^2)/(gamma^2). So (m c²)^2/(E^2) = 1/(gamma^2). So beta = sqrt(1 - (m c^2/E)^2 ), which is the same as before.

But perhaps I should calculate it more accurately. Let me compute it.

E = 8 GeV, m = 1.2 GeV/c². So the ratio (m c²)/E = (1.2 GeV/c² * c²) / 8 GeV = 1.2 /8 = 0.15. So (m c²/E) = 0.15. So beta is sqrt(1 - (0.15)^2) = sqrt(1 - 0.0225) = sqrt(0.9775). Let me compute that. 0.988^2 is 0.976144, 0.988^2= (approx) 0.976144. 0.9887^2 is approximately 0.9775.

Wait, let me get the exact value. 0.9887 squared: 9887 * 9887. Let me compute:

9887^2 = (10000 - 113)^2 = 10000^2 - 2*10000*113 + 113^2.

Wait, that's a bit complicated, but perhaps I
