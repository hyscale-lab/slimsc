Okay, so I've got this physics problem in front of me about particle decays, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me try to break it down.

The question is about the allowed decay modes of a boson X. The given Lagrangian is L(y) = -λf ψ_f(y) (ῡ + X(y)) ψ_f(y). Hmm, I think I remember that the Lagrangian describes the interaction between fields. So X is a bosonic field, and the fermions are interacting with it.

The mass of the boson X is 6 GeV. I need to find out which particles X can decay into. Since it's a boson, it can decay into fermion-antifermion pairs, right? Because bosons are force carriers and usually mediate between fermions.

Looking at the Lagrangian, the interaction term seems to be λf ψ_f X. So the coupling is between X and the fermion ψ_f. That would mean X can decay into ψ_f and its antiparticle, ψ_f_bar. But wait, the problem is asking about all possible decays, so I need to consider all possible fermions that X can interact with.

Wait, but I'm probably supposed to look at the fermions that have a mass lower than X's mass. Because for a decay to happen, the rest mass of the decay products must be less than the mass of the decaying particle. Oh right, X has a mass of 6 GeV, so any pair it decays into must have a combined mass less than or equal to 6 GeV. Also, each fermion's mass must be less than half of X's mass because you can't have a particle heavier than half the mass when creating a pair.

So the possible fermions would be those with mass less than 3 GeV (since 6 GeV divided by 2 is 3 GeV). Let me think about the masses of the known fermions.

The fermion masses I know are approximately:

- Electron (e): ~0.0005 GeV
- Muon (μ): ~0.105 GeV
- Tau (τ): ~1.777 GeV
- Up quark (u): ~2.3 MeV (0.0023 GeV)
- Down quark (d): ~4.7 MeV (0.0047 GeV)
- Strange quark (s): ~95 MeV (0.095 GeV)
- Charm quark (c): ~1.5 GeV
- Bottom quark (b): ~4.7 GeV
- Top quark (t): way heavier, around 173 GeV.

Wait, so the top quark is way too heavy—so X can’t decay into top quarks. Let's list the fermions that are lighter than 3 GeV each.

- e, μ, τ: their masses are way under 3 GeV.
- u, d, s: also way under.
- c: 1.5 GeV, which is under 3 GeV.
- b: 4.7 GeV, which is more than 3 GeV. So X can't decay into b quarks because each b is 4.7 GeV, so two would be 9.4 GeV, way above 6 GeV. So b quark pairs are out.

Similarly, t is way too heavy, so no. So the possible fermion pairs are from the fermions with mass less than 3 GeV.

So the fermions allowed are e, μ, τ, u, d, s, and c.

Wait, but wait: the interaction term in the Lagrangian is -λ f ψ_f (ῡ + X). Hmm, I think I should think about which fermions X can interact with. The term is λ f ψ_f X. So the fermions ψ_f must be the ones that X couples to. So if the fermions are in the loop or something, but for decays, the X must directly couple to the fermion.

So, for X to decay into a pair of fermions (ff̄), X must have a coupling to those fermions. So if the Lagrangian only includes certain fermions, then only those can be decay products.

Wait, the problem gives the interaction Lagrangian as L(y) = -λ f ψ_f (ῡ + X) ψ_f. Wait, wait, maybe I'm misinterpreting that. Let me parse it again.

The term is λ f ψ_f (ῡ + X) ψ_f. Hmm, maybe I can think of it as X coupling to ψ_f. So X is interacting with fermions ψ_f.

Assuming that the fermion field ψ_f is any fermion that the X boson can couple to. But in the given problem, it's written as L(y) = -λ f ψ_f (ῡ + X) ψ_f. Wait, I'm a bit confused about the structure here. Wait, perhaps the interaction is more like X coupling to a scalar made of two fermions? Or perhaps it's written as X ψ_f ψ_f, meaning X couples to two ψ_f fermions.

Wait, the term could be written as -λ ψ_f (ῡ + X) ψ_f. Let me see: that would be -λ ψ_f [ῡ + X] ψ_f. So expanding, it's -λ ψ_f^† ψ_f (ῡ + X) ψ_f. Wait, that doesn't make much sense. Oh wait, perhaps the term is more like λ X ψ_f ψ_f? So maybe the interaction is X ψ_f ψ_f, which would be a Yukawa coupling. So X couples to any fermion ψ_f. So ψ_f can be any fermion, but perhaps only certain ones are present in the Lagrangian.

Wait, but the problem doesn't specify which fermions are present. So perhaps the interaction is written in terms of all possible fermions. Or maybe the question assumes that X can interact with any fermion, so the decay is limited by the mass and the available fermions.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is written in a way that the interaction term involves ψ_f and X, so X can decay into any fermion-antifermion pair where the fermion is ψ_f, as long as the mass is less than 6 GeV.

Wait, perhaps in the Lagrangian, ψ_f is a generic notation
