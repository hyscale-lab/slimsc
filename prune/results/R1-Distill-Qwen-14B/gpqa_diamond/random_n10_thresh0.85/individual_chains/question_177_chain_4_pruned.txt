Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me try to break it down. 

The question is about two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. I remember that the luminosity of a star is related to its radius and temperature. Oh right, the Stefan-Boltzmann law! It says that the luminosity L is proportional to the radius squared multiplied by the temperature to the fourth power. So the formula is L = 4πR²σT⁴, where σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant. But since we're comparing two stars, the constants would cancel out, so I can focus on the ratio of L1 to L2.

So first, the given data: Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times that of Star_2 (R1 = 1.5 R2). The mass is also 1.5 times larger (M1 = 1.5 M2). Hmm, but wait, how does mass relate here? Oh, I'm not sure. Maybe it's a red herring or maybe it's relevant for another part of the problem. Let's see what else is given.

The problem mentions that the wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest are the same. Oh, right! The peak wavelength of a blackbody's emission is given by Wien's Law, λ_max = b / T, where b is Wien's displacement constant. If both stars have the same λ_max, that means their temperatures must be the same. Because λ_max is inversely proportional to temperature. So T1 equals T2.

Wait, but that can't be right. Because if their temperatures are the same and their radii are different, their luminosities would be different. Let me think again. Yes, because L depends on R² T⁴. So if T is the same, then L would be proportional to R squared. Since R1 is 1.5 R2, L1 would be (1.5)^2 times L2 = 2.25 times. But wait, the options include 2.25 as option A, but other options are close to that. But the problem said that the stars' radial velocities are 0 and 700 km/s. How does that come into play?

Oh, radial velocity is probably about Doppler shift. The observed wavelength of maximum emission would be affected by the star's motion towards or away from us. Because if a star is moving towards us (or away), the observed wavelength shifts due to the Doppler effect. So maybe the given λ_max is the observed wavelength, not the rest wavelength. So I can't just assume T is the same based on the same observed λ_max. Instead, I have to account for the Doppler shift.

Wait, so Star_1 has a radial velocity of 0 km/s, so no Doppler shift for it. Star_2 is moving at 700 km/s. So the wavelength we observe from Star_2 is shifted. Let's think about this. The Doppler shift formula for light is λ_observed = λ_rest * sqrt( (1 + v_r) / (1 - v_r) ) ), where v_r is the radial velocity towards the observer as a fraction of the speed of light. Wait, but wait, the formula can be a bit tricky. I think the relativistic Doppler shift formula is λ_obs = λ_rest * sqrt( (1 + v/c) / (1 - v/c) ) ), where v is positive if moving away. So if Star_2 is moving away (since velocity is 700 km/s, but I'm not sure if it's towards or away— the problem just says radial velocity is 700, but the sign matters). 

Wait, the problem says radial velocities are 0 and 700. So for Star_1, v = 0, so λ1 = λ1_rest. For Star_2, v = 700 km/s. Wait, but is it moving towards or away? The problem doesn't specify, but since the observed λ_max is the same for both, that might help. Let me think.

The observed λ_max for both stars is the same. So for Star_1: λ1_obs = λ1_rest. For Star_2: λ2_obs = λ2_rest * sqrt( (1 + v/c)/(1 - v/c) ), or maybe (1 - v/c)/(1 + v/c) if moving towards. Wait, I need to get the Doppler shift formula correctly.

The Doppler effect formula for wavelength when the source is moving away is λ_obs = λ_rest * sqrt( (1 + v/c) / (1 - v/c) ), where v is positive if moving away. Alternatively, if the source is moving towards, the observed wavelength is blueshifted, so λ_obs = λ_rest * sqrt( (1 - v/c)/(1 + v/c) ). 

Since Star_1's velocity
