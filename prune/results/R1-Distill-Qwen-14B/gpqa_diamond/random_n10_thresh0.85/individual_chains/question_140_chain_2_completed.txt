Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here. Let me try to break it down step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but let's think through it.

The question is about a substance X reacting with liquid Y, releasing gas W and forming a precipitate G. When G is heated, it releases B, which has a melting point close to 277 K. Also, something about the product of a keto acid with X having two oxygen atoms. X is used as a reagent in organic chemistry.

Hmm, let's start with the gas W. It says W's molecule has the same number of protons and neutrons. Wait, same number of both? So the molecule must be something like O2 or another diatomic gas? Let's think. Protons and neutrons in a molecule? Wait, no, each molecule. So each molecule has same number of protons and neutrons. For instance, O2 has 8 protons each, so total 16 in the molecule. Neutrons per O is 8 (since O is O-16 usually). So each O has 8 n, total 16. So 16 p and 16 n. That's O2. Or maybe something else.

Wait, another possibility: maybe it's CO2? Let's see: CO2 has one C and two O. C has 6 p and 6 n (if C-12), O has 8 p and 8 n. So the molecule has 6+16=22 p and (6 + 16)=22 n. Oh, that's equal too. So CO2 could be W. Or maybe another gas.

But wait, the reaction is violent. So maybe it's a reaction that produces something like CO2. Or perhaps H2? No, H2 has 1 p and 1 n each, but two atoms, so 2 p and 2 n. That also fits. But H2 is from where? If Y is water or acid, maybe.

Wait, but the precipitate G forms when X and Y react. When G is heated, it releases B, and B's melting point is about 277 K. Let me think: 277 K is roughly 4 degrees Celsius. What substance melts near that? Maybe something like water, but that's higher. Alternatively, maybe something else. Wait, 277 K is about 4°C. Hmm, another thought: maybe B is ice, but ice melts at 0°C, which is 273 K. Close to 277, so perhaps B is something else. Wait, 277 is about 4°C. So maybe B is a solid that melts around that temperature. Or perhaps B is a different form, like dry ice? But dry ice sublimates, not melts.

Wait, maybe B is something like glucose or another solid. Alternatively, maybe B is a different product. Let me think about the reaction.

Substance X reacts with Y (a liquid) to form a precipitate G and gas W. So perhaps Y is a solution, like water or an acid. Let's say Y is water. Then, if X is a metal, perhaps reacting violently with water. For example, Na or K reacts violently with water, producing H2 gas. But wait, earlier I thought about H2 as W. So if W is H2, then Y is water. So X could be a metal like Na.

But then the precipitate G would be NaOH, perhaps. Wait, no, NaOH is soluble. Hmm. So maybe the precipitate is something else. Wait, maybe X is a metal carbonate. If Y is an acid, like H2SO4, then X could be a carbonate reacting to produce CO2 gas. So W would be CO2.

Wait, the gas W's molecule has same number of protons and neutrons. Let's check CO2: each O has 8 p and 8 n, C has 6 p and 6 n. So in CO2, total p = 6 + 16 = 22, n = 6 + 16 =22. So yes, same number. So that fits.

So W is CO2. So in the reaction, X is a carbonate, Y is an acid. The precipitate G could be some metal hydroxide if the acid is strong. For example, if X is calcium carbonate and Y is HCl, reaction produces CaCl2 (soluble), CO2 gas, and water. But CaCl2 is soluble, so no precipitate. Hmm, maybe X is a metal carbonate that doesn't produce a soluble salt. Like, say, if Y is a weak acid, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps Y is a base. Let me think differently. Maybe Y is a strong base, and X is an acid. No, because the reaction is violent. More likely, X is a metal reacting with Y as an acid. So maybe X is a metal, Y is an acid, and the reaction produces H2 gas. So W is H2. Now, H2 has 2 atoms, each with 1 p and 1 n, so total p=2, n=2. So same number. So that fits.

So if X is a metal like Na, reacting with Y (water) to produce H2. The precipitate G would be something else. Wait, but sodium reacting with water produces NaOH, which is a solution, but maybe if it's a solution with excess Na, it might form a precipitate? Not sure. Alternatively, maybe X is an alloy or a compound. Maybe it's a heavier metal.

Wait, another angle: when G is heated, it releases B. If G is a carbonate, then heating it might decompose into CO2 and a metal oxide. But then B would be the oxide. Alternatively, if G is a hydroxide, heating might dehydrate it to form an oxide. But B's melting point is around 277 K. So maybe B is a solid like glucose? No, that doesn't fit. Alternatively, maybe B is sodium chloride? No, NaCl melts at higher temps.

Wait, perhaps B is a metal. For example, if G is a metal hydroxide, heating might decompose it to metal oxide and water. So if the metal is Na, then NaOH on heating would decompose to Na2O and H2O. The melting point of Na2O is about 1380°C, which is way higher than 277 K. Hmm, that can't be.

Alternatively, maybe B is a compound that's a solid at room temperature and melts around 277 K. Wait, 277 K is about 4°C. What solid melts around that temperature? Maybe something like camphor? Or perhaps another organic compound. Hmm, not sure yet.

Wait, another angle: The product of X with a keto acid has two oxygen atoms. So X reacting with a keto acid gives a product with two O atoms. If X is a base, maybe it's a strong base, but I'm not sure. Wait, keto acid has a ketone group and a carboxylic acid group. For example, something like cyclohexanone-acetic acid or similar. When X reacts with it, the product has two O atoms. Hmm, perhaps X is a hydride source, like NaBH4. Because NaBH4 reacts with carbonyl groups, such as those in keto acids, to form alcohols. So the product would have an additional O from the carbonyl to the alcohol. Wait, but I'm not clear on that part.

Wait, let's think: the product has two O atoms. Maybe the reaction is the reduction of a carbonyl group, which would change the O count. For example, if the keto acid has a ketone (say, (CH3)2CO) and a COOH group. If X is a hydride like NaBH4, it would reduce the ketone to an alcohol. So the product would have one more O (since the ketone O is converted to an alcohol O). So, from the keto acid, which has two O in the CO and one in COOH, maybe the product would have more O. Hmm, perhaps I'm not getting this part right.

Alternatively, maybe the product is something else. Let me think of the other part: X is known for incorporating a heavier isotope. So one of its elements is a heavier isotope. For example, maybe X is NaCl, but that's just a guess. Or maybe it's something like CH3COOH, but that doesn't fit the violent reaction.

Wait, another thought: if X is a heavy water isotope, like D2O, but that's probably not the case here.

Wait, X is used as a reagent in organic chemistry. Common reagents include things like NaOH, NaBH4, KMnO4, etc. But it's known for a heavier isotope. For example, if X is a metal with a heavy isotope, like maybe something with chlorine? Like maybe CCl4? Or perhaps X is something like D2O, but that's more for NMR.

Wait, another angle: the melting point of B is close to 277 K. 277 K is 4°C. So B is a solid at room temperature, melting near 4°C. What's a common solid that melts around there? Water (ice) melts at 273 K, which is 0°C. So 277 K is a bit above that. Maybe a different form of ice, but that's unlikely. Alternatively, maybe something like paraffin wax, but that's more around 50°C.

Wait, another possibility: maybe B is a different compound. 277 K is 4°C. What solid is known to melt around that temperature? Maybe something like a certain type of fat or wax. Or perhaps B is another material, like a metal that has a low melting point. Wait, sodium has a melting point around 371 K (98°C), which is higher. Mercury is a liquid at room temp, so no. Maybe something like gallium? Gallium melts around 29°C, which is 302 K. Close but not exactly 277. So perhaps not.

Wait, let me think about the elements involved. The product of X with a keto acid has two O atoms. So the product is perhaps a diol or something similar. For example, if the keto acid is something like cyclohexanone-acetic acid, and X is a reducing agent like NaBH4, which would reduce the ketone to an alcohol. So the product would have an additional OH group, adding an O. So maybe the product is a hemiacetal or something with two Os. Not sure.

Wait, perhaps the product is a secondary alcohol. So if the keto acid is R-CO-R', then X (like NaBH4) would reduce it to R-CHOH-R'. That adds an O? Wait, the original carbonyl O becomes an alcohol O. So the O count in that part doesn't change. Hmm, maybe that's not it.

Alternatively, maybe the product is something like an enol. But that's speculative.

Let me get back to the initial reaction. X reacts with Y (liquid) to produce gas W and precipitate G. W is CO2 or H2. If W is CO2, then X could be a carbonate reacting with an acid. The precipitate G would be a metal hydroxide if the acid is strong. But if the acid is in excess, the hydroxide would dissolve. Hmm.

Wait, another thought: If X is a sulfide, and Y is an acid (like H2SO4), then the reaction might produce H2S gas. But H2S has 2 p and 2 n (each H: 1p, 1n; S:16 p, 16 n). So total p=2 + (2*16) = 34, n=2 + (2*16)=34? No, wait, the molecule would have 2*(1 + 16) = 34 p and same for n. So 34 each. So same number. So W could be H2S.

But H2S is a gas, but not sure about the reaction. Also, what precipitate would form? If X is a metal sulfide, reacting with an acid would produce the metal ions in solution and H2S. But if the metal's oxide is insoluble, perhaps it precipitates. Alternatively, maybe it's a different reaction.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is between a metal and an acid. For example, Mg reacting with HCl to produce MgCl2, H2 gas, and heat. So W is H2. Then Y is HCl, and X is Mg. The precipitate G could be MgCl2, but that's soluble. Hmm, no precipitate in that case. So maybe that's not right.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a metal carbonate. For example, CaCO3 reacts with HCl to form CaCl2, CO2, and H2O. CO2 is the gas W. The precipitate would be none, as CaCl2 is soluble. So that doesn't fit since G is a precipitate.

Hmm, perhaps X is a hydroxide. For example, Cu(OH)2 reacting with an acid could produce a salt and water, but no precipitate. Wait, but if the acid is weak, maybe the hydroxide doesn't dissolve, so it precipitates? Not sure.

Wait, maybe Y is a solution of a salt, and X is something else. Alternatively, perhaps Y is a base, and X is an acid. But then the reaction would produce a salt and water, but again, not sure about precipitate.

Let me think of another angle: the problem states that the product of X with a keto acid has two O atoms. So perhaps X is a reducing agent that donates H, converting a ketone to an alcohol. So the product would have two O atoms in the molecule. So the product could be a secondary alcohol. For example, if the keto acid is a diketone, adding H would give a diol. Or perhaps it's a single ketone group being converted to an alcohol, adding an H but not changing O count.

Wait, perhaps the product is a hemiacetal or something else. Hmm, not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a diol, but that's not a reagent I'm familiar with.

Wait, another clue: X is known for incorporating a heavier isotope. So perhaps one of its elements has a heavy isotope. For example, chlorine has a heavy isotope (Cl-35 vs Cl-37). So if X contains Cl, then perhaps it's something like CHCl3, but I'm not sure.

Wait, X is used as a reagent in organic chemistry. Common reagents include things like NaBH4 (reducing agent), KMnO4 (oxidizing), H2SO4 (acidic catalyst), etc. If X is NaBH4, then let's see.

If X is NaBH4:

- Reacts with Y (liquid) to produce gas W, precipitate G. Wait, NaBH4 is a solid, but when reacted with something like water, it might produce H2 and form NaBO2 or something. Hmm, I'm not sure.

Wait, another thought: perhaps X is LiAlH4, a stronger reducing agent. It reacts violently with water, producing H2 gas. The precipitate could be some aluminum compound. But LiAlH4 is a solid, and reacting with water would produce LiAl(OH)4, which is soluble. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps X is something like H2O, but that's a liquid, not a reagent in this context.

Wait, maybe X is a heavy isotope of hydrogen, like D2O (deuterium oxide), but that's more for isotopic labeling.

Wait, another thought: The precipitate G, when heated, releases B whose melting point is near 277 K. If B is something like glucose, which is a solid but melts around higher temps, that doesn't fit. Alternatively, maybe B is a different material.

Wait, maybe B is a solid oxide. For example, if G is a carbonate, heating would release CO2 and leave a metal oxide. The metal oxide would have a melting point that fits. Let's see, sodium oxide (Na2O) has a melting point of about 1380°C, which is way higher than 277 K. Doesn't fit.

Alternatively, perhaps G is a hydroxide. Heating might dehydrate it to form an oxide. For example, if G is Cu(OH)2, heating it would produce CuO and water. CuO's melting point is around 2300°C, which is way higher than 277 K. So that's not it.

Wait, perhaps G is a sulfate. Heating might not change it, but I'm not sure.

Another approach: What is the melting point of 277 K? That's 4°C, so a solid that melts just above 0°C. Hmm, maybe B is a certain type of ice or a different crystalline form, but ice melts at 0°C (273 K). So 277 is a bit higher. Could it be a different solid?

Alternatively, maybe B is a salt that has a low melting point. For example, sodium nitrate decomposes at higher temps, but that's not helpful.

Wait, perhaps B is a byproduct of the reaction. Let me think about the reaction steps again.

X reacts with Y to produce W and G. G is a precipitate, so it's insoluble. When G is heated, it releases B. So perhaps G is a carbonate, and B is CO2. But then, the melting point of CO2 (dry ice) is not a solid but a gas. Hmm, not that.

Alternatively, perhaps G is a bicarbonate. Heating NaHCO3 produces Na2CO3, CO2, and H2O. So B would be Na2CO3, which has a melting point around 842°C, way higher.

Wait, maybe G is a different compound. Let me think of another possible reaction.

If X is a metal like Mg, Y is cold water, but Mg doesn't react with water. However, Mg reacts with acids to produce H2 gas. So Y could be an acid, and X is Mg. The reaction would be Mg + H2SO4 → MgSO4 + H2↑. But MgSO4 is soluble, so no precipitate. Hmm.

Alternatively, if Y is a salt solution. For example, if Y is a solution of AgNO3 and X is NaCl. Then the reaction would produce AgCl precipitate and NaNO3. So W would be none, but perhaps that's not the case.

Wait, but the reaction produces a gas. So perhaps X is a carbonate, Y is an acid. Let's say X is CaCO3, Y is HCl. Reaction: CaCO3 + 2HCl → CaCl2 + CO2↑ + H2O. CaCl2 is soluble, so no precipitate. So that doesn't fit.

Wait, perhaps X is a different carbonate, like PbCO3. PbCO3 is slightly soluble, maybe if Y is HCl, the reaction produces PbCl2 (which is only slightly soluble, perhaps as a precipitate). So PbCO3 + 2HCl → PbCl2 + CO2 + H2O. If PbCl2 is a precipitate, which it is only slightly soluble, then G is PbCl2. Heating G (PbCl2) would decompose to PbO and HCl gas. So B would be PbO. What's the melting point of PbO? It's about 890°C, which again is way higher than 277 K.

Hmm. I'm getting stuck here. Let me try to approach from the product with the keto acid. The product contains 2 atoms of oxygen. So perhaps the product is a compound with two O atoms. For example, if the keto acid is something like acetone (which is a ketone), and X is a reducing agent that converts the ketone to an alcohol, which has an -OH group. So acetone (propan-2-one) would become propan-2-ol. So the product would have an OH group, which is one O. The keto acid would have two O in the ketone and another in the acid group. So maybe the product has two O atoms—like an alcohol and another O elsewhere.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a dihydrogen source, adding two H's. Hmm.

Wait, another possibility: X is a metal hydride, like NaBH4. When it reacts with a keto acid, say, cyclohexanone-acetic acid, it could reduce the ketone to an alcohol. So the product would have two O atoms: one from the alcohol and one from the carboxylic acid. So that fits.

So, if X is NaBH4, then:

- Substance X: NaBH4. It's a reagent in organic chemistry, correct.

- It reacts with a keto acid to form a product with two O atoms. That makes sense.

Now, the reaction of NaBH4 with Y (liquid) produces gas W and precipitate G.

NaBH4 is a solid. When it reacts with a liquid, what could that be? Well, NaBH4 reacts with water to produce NaBO2, H2, and maybe some other products. The reaction is: NaBH4 + 2 H2O → NaBO2 + 4 H2↑. So W would be H2 gas. H2 has 2 protons and 2 neutrons (each H has 1 p, 1n; so 2 in total). So same number of protons and neutrons. That fits.

So Y could be water. Then, the reaction produces H2 gas and NaBO2. But NaBO2 is soluble in water, so no precipitate. Hmm, so this doesn't fit because the question says a precipitate G forms. So maybe Y isn't water.

Wait, perhaps Y is another liquid, like an alcohol. NaBH4 reacts with alcohols but typically doesn't release H2. Alternatively, perhaps Y is a different solvent.

Wait, another possibility: Y is an acid, like H2SO4. NaBH4 would react with it, but I'm not sure about the products. Alternatively, perhaps Y is a different solution.

Wait, perhaps Y is an aqueous solution of something else. Maybe Y is a solution that reacts with NaBH4 to produce a precipitate.

Alternatively, perhaps X isn't NaBH4. Let me think of another reagent.

Wait, another common reagent is LiAlH4. It's a strong reducing agent. Let's see. LiAlH4 reacts with water to produce H2 gas, LiAl(OH)4, and maybe other products. The reaction is: LiAlH4 + 2 H2O → LiAl(OH)4 + 4 H2↑. LiAl(OH)4 is soluble, so no precipitate. So that doesn't fit either.

Hmm. Maybe X isn't a hydride. Let me think about other reagents.

Wait, another possibility: X is H2O2. It's a reagent, but I'm not sure about the reactions.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a metal, say, magnesium, which reacts with an acid to produce H2 gas. The precipitate could be a metal hydroxide, but that's not likely because most metal hydroxides are either soluble or form on the surface.

Wait, maybe X is a metal carbonate, and Y is a strong acid. The reaction produces CO2 gas, and the precipitate is the metal salt. Wait, but most metal salts are soluble. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps Y is a solution of a salt that isn't soluble, and X is a metal that displaces it. For example, X is zinc metal, and Y is a solution of AgNO3. The reaction would produce Ag (precipitate), Zn(NO3)2, and no gas. So that doesn't fit since W is a gas.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is between a metal and a solution of a sulfide. For example, Fe reacts with H2S to produce FeS precipitate and H2 gas. So W is H2, X is Fe, Y is H2S. Then, G is FeS. Heating FeS would produce FeO and H2S gas. FeO's melting point is high, so that doesn't fit. Hmm.

Wait, another thought: If X is a heavy isotope, perhaps it's something like CCl4. But CCl4 isn't a reagent that reacts violently with a liquid to produce a gas and precipitate.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a heavier element isotope in something like D2O, but that's not a typical reagent for reactions producing precipitates.

Hmm, I'm getting stuck. Let me think of the melting point of B again. 277 K is about 4°C. What solid has a melting point near that? Maybe a certain type of paraffin wax or another organic compound. But I'm not sure.

Wait, another angle: the product of X with a keto acid has two O atoms. So the product must have exactly two O. For example, maybe it's a diethyl ether derivative, but that's stretching it.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a simple alcohol with two O atoms. Wait, no, an alcohol has one O. Unless it's something like a geminal diol, but those are unstable.

Wait, perhaps the product is a carbonyl group that's been reduced, adding an H but not changing O count. Hmm, not helpful.

Wait, perhaps the product is a ketone that's been converted into a secondary alcohol, which introduces an additional H but not O. So the O count remains the same. That doesn't explain two O atoms.

Wait, maybe the keto acid has three O atoms, and the product has two. So perhaps the reaction removes an O. For example, if the keto acid is something like (CH3)2COOH (which has a ketone and COOH groups, so O count is 3 (ketone O) + 2 (COOH O) = 5? Not sure.

I'm getting stuck. Let me try to think of the elements in X. X reacts to form W, which is H2 or CO2. If W is H2, then X might be a metal like Na or Mg. If W is CO2, X could be a carbonate. But the problem states that X is known for incorporating a heavier isotope of one of its elements. So perhaps one of the elements in X has a heavy isotope.

If X is Na, the heavier isotope would be Na-23 (since Na is monoisotopic, all Na is Na-23). No, that doesn't make sense. Wait, perhaps X contains Cl, which has Cl-35 and Cl-37 isotopes. So if X is something like NaCl, but that's a salt.

Wait, another thought: X could be a compound containing a heavy isotope, like C-14, but that's rare and not practical for this context.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a compound with a bromine atom, which has several heavy isotopes. But I'm not sure.

Wait, another angle: the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements in X. The options are 31, 25, etc. So maybe X has two elements, and their atomic masses add up to one of these.

If X is NaBH4, the elements are Na, B, H. Lightest is H (1), heaviest is Na (23). Sum is 24, but that's not an option. Hmm.

If X is something like CH3COOH (acetic acid), elements C, H, O. Lightest is H (1), heaviest is O (16). Sum is 17, not an option.

Wait, another approach: the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements in X. So, for example, if X is a molecule with two elements, the sum of their lightest and heaviest isotopes' masses.

Wait, but the question says, "the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements present within Substance X". So if X has multiple elements, we take the lightest element's atomic mass and the heaviest element's atomic mass, sum them.

Wait, for example, if X is NaCl, elements Na (atomic mass ~23) and Cl (atomic mass ~35.5). So lightest is Na (23), heaviest is Cl (35.5). Sum is about 58.5. Not an option.

Wait, the options are 35, 25, 31, 29. So perhaps the sum is around 31 or 29.

Another thought: if X is H2O, elements H and O. Lightest H (1), heaviest O (16). Sum is 17. Not matching.

Wait, if X is CH4, elements C and H. Lightest H (1), heaviest C (12). Sum is 13. Not an option.

Hmm.

Wait, maybe X is a diatomic molecule. Like O2 or something else.

Alternatively, perhaps X is something like NH3, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another thought: if X is NaOH. Elements Na, O, H. Lightest H (1), heaviest Na (23). Sum is 24. Not an option.

Wait, perhaps X contains C and O. For example, CO2. Then, lightest is C (~12), heaviest O (~16). Sum is 28. Not an option.

Wait, another option: X is a compound with elements like C and O, perhaps. Or maybe X is something like C2H5OH (ethanol), but that's elements C, H, O. Lightest H (1), heaviest O (16). Sum 17.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the elements in X are H and O. Like H2O. Sum is 1 + 16 =17. Not an option.

Wait, another angle: the cumulative sum refers to the sum of all lightest and heaviest isotopes in X. For example, if X has multiple atoms of an element, each with their isotopes, we sum all the lightest and heaviest of each. Wait, that sounds complicated.

Wait, the question says, "the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements present within Substance X, considering that if multiple instances of an element exist, the masses of all the heavier and lighter isotopes must be summed."

So for each element in X, we have to sum the lightest isotopes and the heaviest isotopes across all atoms of that element in X. Then, add the sums for all elements. Wait, no, perhaps the lightest and heaviest elements in X, and sum their atomic masses.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me look at the options again.

Options are 35, 25, 31, 29.

Wait, 35 is the atomic mass of Cl (approx 35). 25 is around magnesium (24.3), 31 is around Ar (39.9), no, wait 31 is close to S (32.07). Wait, 31 is near P (30.97). Hmm.

Wait, 29 is close to Si (28.085) or maybe aluminum (27). Wait, 29 is near aluminum but closer to something else.

Alternatively, perhaps the sum of the lightest and heaviest elements in X is 31. For example, if X has elements like H and S. H is lightest (1), S is heaviest (32.07). Sum is 33, which is near option C (31). Hmm, not exact.

Wait, perhaps X is something with elements like O and Cl. O is 16, Cl is 35.5. Sum is 51.5. Not an option.

Wait, another thought: if X is HCl, elements H and Cl. H's lightest is 1, Cl's heaviest is 36.9 (but Cl has a major isotope at 35 and 37). So sum would be 1 +37=38. Not an option.

Hmm, this is getting tricky. Let me try to recap the possible elements in X.

If X is a metal like Na, then elements are Na and the counterion. If Y is an acid, the precipitate could be something else. Maybe, but I'm not getting anywhere.

Wait, the precipitate G, when heated, releases B. If G is a metal carbonate, heating would release CO2. But then B would be the metal oxide. Alternatively, if G is a metal hydroxide, heating might release H2O and leave the metal oxide.

If the melting point of B is 277 K, which is 4°C, perhaps B is a different kind of oxide. Or maybe B is a solid like glucose, but I don't see the connection.

Alternatively, perhaps B is a solid byproduct, but I'm stuck.

Wait, maybe I should consider that the problem is about something else. Let me think about the reagent X. It's used in organic chemistry. Common reagents are NaBH4, LiAlH4, KMnO4, H2SO4, etc.

If X is NaBH4 (sodium borohydride), which is a reducing agent, then:

- X reacts with Y (maybe an acid) to produce H2 gas (W) and a precipitate G. Wait, earlier thoughts on this didn't fit because the products were soluble.

But perhaps Y is something else. Let me think: NaBH4 reacts with ethyl acetate under certain conditions. Not sure. Alternatively, perhaps Y is a ketone, but that's part of the keto acid reaction.

Alternatively, perhaps Y is an alcohol. NaBH4 reacts with alcohols, but under certain conditions may not produce a precipitate.

Wait, another angle: when NaBH4 reacts with a keto acid, the product is an alcohol. That would have two O atoms: from the alcohol and perhaps another from the acid. So that fits.

But back to the initial reaction. If X is NaBH4, and Y is an acid like H2SO4, the reaction would be:

NaBH4 + H2SO4 → NaHSO4 + H3BO3 + H2↑.

Wait, but NaHSO4 is soluble, so no precipitate. So G wouldn't form. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps Y is a solution of a different acid. Maybe Y is HCl.

NaBH4 + HCl → NaCl + H3BO3 + H2↑. NaCl is soluble, so no precipitate. Hmm.

Wait, another possibility: Y is a solution of a metal nitrate. For example, AgNO3. Then, NaBH4 might reduce Ag+ to Ag metal, which would precipitate.

Reaction: NaBH4 + AgNO3 → NaNO3 + Ag + H3BO3 + H2↑.

In this case, W is H2, G is Ag, which would precipitate. Then, when G (Ag) is heated, it would stay as Ag metal, but that doesn't fit the melting point condition.

Alternatively, perhaps G is a different compound. Not sure.

Wait, maybe the reaction produces AgBH4, which is insoluble. But I don't think that's correct.

This is getting too complicated. Let me try to think of the possible answer based on the options. The options are 35,25,31,29.

If X is a compound containing hydrogen and boron, like NaBH4, then the lightest element is H (1), heaviest is B (10.8) or Na (23). Wait, no, X is NaBH4, which has Na (23), B (10.8), H (1). So the lightest element is H (1), heaviest is Na (23). Sum is 24, which isn't an option.

Wait, another possibility: X is H2O, but earlier that didn't fit.

Wait, if X is CCl4, elements C and Cl. C's lightest is 12, Cl's heaviest is 35.5 (approx). Sum is 47.5. Not an option.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps X is CO2. Lightest element is C (12), heaviest O (16). Sum is 28. Closest option is D)29, but not exact.

Wait, another thought: perhaps X is a compound with elements H and O. Like H2O. Sum is 1 +16=17, not an option.

Wait, maybe X is NH3. Elements N and H. Lightest H (1), heaviest N (14). Sum 15. Not an option.

Hmmm. I'm stuck. Let me try to think of the answer options.

Options are A)35, B)25, C)31, D)29.

Wait, 35 is the approximate atomic mass of Cl. 25 is around Mg (24.3), 31 is near S (32), 29 is near Al (27) or maybe something else.

Wait, if X is Mg, then elements are Mg (24.3) and maybe O from a compound. But I'm not sure.

Wait, another angle: the problem says that the product of X with a keto acid has two O atoms. So perhaps the product is something like CH3CH2OH (ethanol), which has two O atoms. Wait, ethanol has two O? No, ethanol has one O. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a gem-diol, but those are rare.

Wait, perhaps the product is a ketone that's been reduced to a secondary alcohol. So the product would have an O from the alcohol and another from the acid group. So two O's. So that fits.

But this doesn't directly help with X's identity.

Wait, perhaps the answer is C)31. Because 31 is close to S (32), but let me think.

If X is SO2, then S is 32, O is 16. Sum is 48. Not 31.

Hmm. Alternatively, if X is something like H2S (but that's a gas, not a reagent in the way described).

Alternatively, perhaps X is a compound with elements C and O. Like CO, which has C (12) and O (16). Sum is 28. Not 31.

Wait, another angle: the sum of the lightest and heaviest elements in X. If X is NaOH, elements Na (23), O (16), H (1). Lightest H (1), heaviest Na (23). Sum 24. Not an option.

Wait, another thought: what if X is a molecule with two elements, and their atomic masses add up to one of the options. For example, 31 could be 15 (P) + 16 (O) =31? Not sure if that's relevant.

Alternatively, 31 could be the sum of the lightest and heaviest elements in X. For example, if X is something like CCl2F2, then C is lightest (12), Cl is heaviest (35.5). Sum is 47.5. Not 31.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a diatomic molecule like O2. Then, each O is 16. So lightest and heaviest are same. Sum is 32. Close to option C (31). Maybe that's it.

But O2 is a gas, not a solid. So perhaps X isn't O2.

Wait, but the reagent part. O2 isn't a reagent in the sense of being a substance that reacts in a specific way.

Hmm.

I think I'm stuck. Given the time I've spent, I'll try to make an educated guess. The options suggest that the sum is around 31. Looking back, if X is something like CH3CH2OH (ethanol), but that's not a reagent that fits the earlier description. Alternatively, maybe the sum is 29, which is close to aluminum.

Wait, another thought: if X is NaCl, which is used as a reagent in some contexts. Then, Na is 23, Cl is 35.5. Sum is 58.5. Not an option.

Wait, perhaps the lightest element is H (1), and the heaviest is something like S (32). So 1+32=33. Close to option C (31). But I'm not sure.

I think I'll have to take a guess based on the options. The most plausible scenario I can think of is that X is NaBH4, which is a common reagent, and the sum of the lightest and heaviest elements (H and B?) No, H is 1, B is 10.8. Sum 11.8, not an option.

Alternatively, perhaps X is something like CaCO3. Ca (40), C (12), O (16). Lightest C (12), heaviest Ca (40). Sum 52, not an option.

Wait, another angle: maybe the elements in X are B and H. So X has B (10.8) and H (1). Sum is 11.8, but that's not an option.

Hmm. I've tried multiple angles, and I'm not getting a clear path. Given the time, I'll have to make a guess. Since the options include 31, which is close to the sum of 12 (C) and 19 (F). Wait, maybe X is something like CHF3. Then, C (12), H (1), F (19). Lightest H (1), heaviest F (19). Sum 20. Not matching.

Alternatively, perhaps X is something with elements like O and F. O (16), F (19). Sum is 35. That's option A.

Wait, 16 +19 =35. That's option A. But why would X be a compound with O and F? I'm not sure, but maybe.

So, if X is O and F, their sum is 35, which is option A.

But I'm not confident. Another possibility is that X is a molecule with elements like C and O, sum 12 +16=28, close to option D (29). Not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps X is something like CHCl3. C (12), H (1), Cl (35.5). Sum of lightest H (1) and heaviest Cl (35.5) is 36.5, close to option A (35). So maybe the answer is A)35.

But I'm not certain. Given the time I've spent, I'll go with option C)31, as it's in the middle, but I'm not confident.


The problem involves identifying the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements in Substance X, which reacts violently with liquid Y to release gas W, forms a precipitate G, and produces a compound B upon heating G. Additional clues include the melting point of B (~277 K), the product of X with a keto acid containing two oxygen atoms, and the use of X as a reagent in organic chemistry. Substance X is noted for incorporating a heavier isotope of one of its constituent elements.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Gas W**: The molecule of W has the same number of protons and neutrons. Possible candidates include H₂ (2 protons, 2 neutrons) or CO₂ (22 protons, 22 neutrons). H₂ is more likely due to its violent reaction with water or acids, producing a gas and precipitate.

2. **Substance X**: X is a reagent in organic chemistry, suggesting it could be a reducing agent like NaBH₄ or LiAlH₄. These reagents react with liquid Y (possibly water or an acid) to produce H₂ gas and a precipitate. However, the precipitate G must align with the subsequent heating step, where B is released with a melting point of ~277 K (4°C).

3. **Melting Point of B**: The melting point of B (~277 K) suggests it is a solid that melts slightly above 0°C. This could imply B is a metal oxide or another compound, though the exact identity remains unclear.

4. **Keto Acid Reaction**: The product of X with a keto acid contains two oxygen atoms. This suggests X reduces a carbonyl group in the keto acid to an alcohol, retaining the oxygen count or introducing a new oxygen atom.

5. **Cumulative Atomic Masses**: The problem requires summing the atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements in X. For example:
   - If X is NaBH₄, the lightest element is H (1), and the heaviest is Na (23), giving a sum of 24 (not an option).
   - If X is CH₄, the lightest is H (1), and the heaviest is C (12), giving a sum of 13 (not an option).
   - If X is CO₂, the lightest is C (12), and the heaviest is O (16), giving a sum of 28 (close to option D, 29).
   - If X is HCl, the lightest is H (1), and the heaviest is Cl (35.5), giving a sum of 36.5 (close to option A, 35).

6. **Options Analysis**:
   - **A) 35**: Matches the sum of H (1) and Cl (35.5) if X contains these elements.
   - **B) 25**: Suggests elements like Mg (24.3) and H (1), but this does not align with the reaction description.
   - **C) 31**: Close to the sum of C (12) and S (19.97), though no clear evidence links X to these elements.
   - **D) 29**: Close to the sum of C (12) and O (16), aligning with CO₂ but requiring further confirmation.

### Conclusion:
Based on the analysis, the most plausible answer is **A) 35**, as it aligns with the cumulative atomic masses of H and Cl, which could be components of X. However, the exact identity of X remains uncertain due to the complexity of the reaction and the melting point of B.
