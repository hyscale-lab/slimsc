Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about cobalt complexes and stability constants. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through it.

The question is about finding the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes among all the cobalt species in solution. The solution has Co(II) ions and thiocyanate. The concentrations are given: c(Co) is 1e-2 M, and [SCN-] is 0.1 M. The stability constants (β) are β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16.

Wait, I remember that stability constants are for the formation of complexes. Each β represents the formation of a complex with a certain number of SCN- ligands. So Co exists in various complex forms, like [Co(SCN)]^n+, [Co(SCN)_2]^m+, etc., each with their own stability constant.

The problem is asking for the percentage of the dithiocyanato complex, which I assume is the one with two SCN- ligands, like [Co(SCN)₂]^2+? Or wait, maybe it's a different one. Wait, the options are about the blue dithiocyanato complexes. I think different complexes have different colors, but I'm not sure which one is which. Oh, but the problem says the blue one, so perhaps that's the [Co(SCN)_2]^2+ or another. Maybe the actual identification of the complex isn't needed here since we're given the stability constants.

So, in any case, the total cobalt species come from all the possible complexes formed. The approach is to calculate the fraction of each complex formed and then sum them up, focusing on the desired one.

Stability constants are used in the formation of complexes. The general formula for the fraction of each complex is based on the stability constant and the concentrations of the ions.

The formula for the fraction f_n of the complex with n ligands is f_n = (β_n * [SCN]^n) / (1 + sum_{k=1 to 4} β_k [SCN]^k )

Wait, because the total concentration of Co is the sum of all the possible complexes. Each complex contributes a certain fraction based on their stability constants and the ligand concentration.

Wait, but each Co can form complexes with 1, 2, 3, or 4 SCN- ions, right? So the total would be the sum over all possible complexes. So, the fraction for each would be β_n [SCN]^n divided by the sum over all m of β_m [SCN]^m.

Wait, but for each n (from 1 to 4), the fraction f_n is (β_n [SCN]^n) / (sum_{m=0}^4 β_m [SCN]^m + 1) ), but wait, actually, the zero complex is just Co²+ (no ligands), so that's [Co(H2O)6]^2+ or something, but in this problem, I think they're assuming that the complexes are with SCN- only.

Wait, the problem states that the solution contains Co(II) ions and thiocyanate. So, the possible species are Co²+, [Co(SCN)]^+, [Co(SCN)_2]^0, [Co(SCN)_3]^- , [Co(SCN)_4]^{2-}.

Wait, but wait, the stability constants are given as β1, β2, β3, β4. So β1 is for [Co(SCN)]^+, β2 for [Co(SCN)_2]^0, β3 for [Co(SCN)_3]^- , and β4 for [Co(SCN)_4]^{2-}.

So the fractions for each complex are given by f_n = (β_n [SCN]^n) / (β0 [SCN]^0 + β1 [SCN]^1 + β2 [SCN]^2 + β3 [SCN]^3 + β4 [SCN]^4 )

But wait, β0 is the stability constant for the zero complex, which is just 1, because the complex is the ion itself. So the denominator is 1 + β1[SCN] + β2[SCN]^2 + β3[SCN]^3 + β4[SCN]^4.

Wait, let me check: the general expression for the fraction of the complex [Co(SCN)_n]^{2-n} is (β_n [SCN]^n) / (sum from m=0 to 4 of β_m [SCN]^m).

Yes, because the stability constant β_n is defined as Kf = [Co(SCN)_n]/[Co²+][SCN]^n. So the fraction of each complex is proportional to Kf * [SCN]^n.

So, given that, let's compute each term.

Given [SCN-] is 0.1 M.

So let's compute each numerator term:

n=0: β0=1, [SCN]^0=1 → term =1×1=1

n=1: β1=9, [SCN]^1=0.1 → 9×0.1=0.9

n=2: β2=40, [SCN]^2=0.01 →40 × 0.01=0.4

n=3: β3=63, [SCN]^3=0.001 →63 × 0.001=0.063

n=4: β4=16, [SCN]^4=1e-4 →16 × 1e-4=0.0016

Now sum all these terms to get the denominator:

1 (n=0) + 0.9 (n=1) + 0.4 (n=2) + 0.063 (n=3) + 0.0016 (n=4) ≈?

Let me add them step by step.

1 + 0.9 =1.9

1.9 +0.4=2.3

2.3 +0.063=2.363

2.363 +0.0016≈2.3646

So denominator is approximately 2.3646.

Wait, but wait, the fraction for each n is (β_n [SCN]^n) divided by the denominator.

But the question is about the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato complexes. Which n corresponds to dithiocyanato (two SCN-)? So n=2.

So f_2 is (0.4) / 2.3646.

Compute that:

0.4 / 2.3646 ≈ 0.169, which is about 16.9%.

Wait, wait, but 0.4 divided by around 2.3646 is approximately 0.169, which is 16.9%. Looking at the options, option D is 16.9%. So would the answer be D?

Wait, but wait. Let me double-check.

Wait SCN is 0.1 M, right? So [SCN]^n is (0.1)^n for each term.

Another check: n=0: 1 →1.

n=1: 9 *0.1=0.9.

n=2:40*(0.1)^2=40*0.01=0.4.

n=3:63*(0.1)^3=63 *0.001=0.063.

n=4:16*(0.1)^4=16 *0.0001=0.0016.

Sum: 1 +0.9=1.9 +0.4=2.3 +0.063=2.363 +0.0016=2.3646.

Yes.

So f_2 =0.4 /2.3646 = 0.1692 → ~16.92%, which is about 16.9%, option D.

Wait, but the question says "the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes". So, if dithiocyanato is the [Co(SCN)_2]^0 complex, that's n=2.

So the answer would be D) 16.9%.


To determine the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes ([Co(SCN)₂]⁰) among all cobalt-containing species in the solution, we use the stability constants (β₁ = 9, β₂ = 40, β₃ = 63, β₄ = 16) and the given concentrations: [SCN⁻] = 0.1 M and total cobalt concentration c(Co) = 10⁻² M. The fraction of each cobalt complex is proportional to the term βₙ[SCN]ⁿ, where n is the number of SCN⁻ ligands.

### Step 1: Calculate the contributions of each complex
The contributions for each complex are:
- **n = 0**: β₀ = 1, [SCN]⁰ = 1 → Contribution = 1 × 1 = 1.
- **n = 1**: β₁ = 9, [SCN]¹ = 0.1 → Contribution = 9 × 0.1 = 0.9.
- **n = 2**: β₂ = 40, [SCN]² = 0.01 → Contribution = 40 × 0.01 = 0.4.
- **n = 3**: β₃ = 63, [SCN]³ = 0.001 → Contribution = 63 × 0.001 = 0.063.
- **n = 4**: β₄ = 16, [SCN]⁴ = 0.0001 → Contribution = 16 × 0.0001 = 0.0016.

### Step 2: Calculate the denominator
The denominator is the sum of all contributions:
\[
\text{Denominator} = 1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016 = 2.3646.
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the fraction of the dithiocyanato complex
The fraction of the dithiocyanato complex ([Co(SCN)₂]⁰, n = 2) is:
\[
f_2 = \frac{\text{Contribution for n = 2}}{\text{Denominator}} = \frac{0.4}{2.3646} \approx 0.169.
\]

### Step 4: Convert to percentage
The percentage of the dithiocyanato complex is:
\[
0.169 \times 100 \approx 16.9\%.
\]

### Final Answer
The percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes among all cobalt-containing species is **16.9%**.
