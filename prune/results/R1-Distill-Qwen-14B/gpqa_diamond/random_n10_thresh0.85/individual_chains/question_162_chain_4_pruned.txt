Okay, so I've got this question about a metric and finding the area of a pseudosphere. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my general relativity, but let's see if I can figure this out.

The metric given is ds² = (32)/(4 - x² - y²) (dx² + dy²). Wait, so this looks like a two-dimensional metric, right? Because it's in terms of x and y. So it's probably describing a surface in some way.

I remember that in differential geometry, the area of a surface can be found using the metric tensor. The general formula for the area element is sqrt(g) dx dy, where g is the determinant of the metric tensor. But wait, in this case, the metric is given in a diagonal form, so maybe it's easier to compute.

Breaking down the metric, it's ds² = (32)/(4 - x² - y²) (dx² + dy²). So the metric components g_xx and g_yy are both 32/(4 - x² - y²). And since it's diagonal, the off-diagonal terms (g_xy and g_yx) are zero. So the metric tensor is diagonal with both terms equal to 32/(4 - r²), where r² is x² + y². Oh wait, maybe I can think in polar coordinates? Because x² + y² would be r², simplifying things.

So, to find the area, I can compute the integral over the surface. The area element dA in 2D is sqrt(det g) dr dθ. Wait, but wait, in 2D, the determinant of the metric is just (g_11)(g_22) - (g_12)^2. But since g_12 is zero, it's just g_11 * g_22.

Wait, in this case, the metric is written in cartesian coordinates, but maybe it's easier to switch to polar coordinates. Because the metric only depends on r^2 = x² + y², so it's spherically symmetric.

So, let me rewrite the metric in polar coordinates. In polar coordinates, dx² + dy² becomes dr² + r² dθ². So the metric becomes ds² = (32)/(4 - r²) (dr² + r² dθ²). So the metric tensor in polar form is diagonal: g_rr = 32/(4 - r²), g_θθ = 32 r²/(4 - r²). The other components (g_rθ and g_θr) are zero.

Now, the area element is sqrt(g_rr * g_θθ) dr dθ. Since the metric is diagonal, the determinant is g_rr * g_θθ. So let's compute that.

g_rr is 32/(4 - r²), and g_θθ is (32 r²)/(4 - r²). So multiplying them together: (32/(4 - r²)) * (32 r²/(4 - r²)) ) = (32^2 r²)/(4 - r²)^2.

So sqrt of that would be (32 r)/(4 - r²). Because sqrt(32^2 r²) is 32 r, and sqrt((4 - r²)^2) is (4 - r²). So the area element dA is (32 r)/(4 - r²) dr dθ.

Now, to find the total area, we integrate dA over the entire surface. Wait, but what are the limits of integration for r and θ?

Looking at the denominator in the metric, 4 - r². The denominator must not be zero, so 4 - r² > 0. So r² <4, so r <2. So the radius r goes from 0 to 2. Theta goes from 0 to 2π.

So the area A is the integral from θ=0 to 2π, and r=0 to 2 of [ (32 r)/(4 - r²) ) ] dr dθ.

Let me compute this integral step by step.

First, separate the integrals since the integrand is a product of functions of r and θ. The integral over θ is from 0 to 2π, which is 2π. So A = 2π * ∫ (from r=0 to 2) [32 r / (4 - r²)] dr.

Now, compute the integral ∫ [32 r / (4 - r²)] dr. Let me make a substitution to solve this. Let u = 4 - r². Then du/dr = -2r → - (du/2) = r dr. So when r=0, u=4. When r=2, u=0.

So the integral becomes ∫ [32 r dr / u ] = 32 ∫ [r dr / u ].

Expressed in terms of u, r dr = (-du/2). So substituting:

32 ∫ [ (-du/2) / u ] = (32) * (-1/2) ∫ (du/u) )= -16 ∫ (du/u).

The limits change from u=4 (when r=0) to u=0 (when r=2). So the integral becomes from u=4 to u=0. So:

-16 ∫ [from 4 to 0] (du/u) = -16 [ ln(u) ] from 4 to 0.

Which is -16 [ ln(0) - ln(4) ].

Wait, ln(0) is negative infinity. Oh, wait, but the integral is from 4 to 0, so when I switch the limits, I get a negative sign:

Wait, ∫ from a to b of f(u) du = - ∫ from b to a of f(u) du. So the integral I have would be ∫ from u=4 to 0 of (1/u) du = - ∫ from 0 to4 of (1/u) du.

Wait, but wait, let's re-express the substitution. When r=0, u=4. When r=2, u=0. So the integral is from 4 to 0. So the substitution gives:

32 * [ (-1/2) ∫ (from u=4 to u=0) (1/u) du ].

Which is 32 * (-1/2) [ ∫ from 4 to 0 (1/u) du ].

That integral is ∫ from 4 to 0 (1/u) du = [ln(u)] from 4 to 0 = ln(0) - ln(4) → which is (-infinite) - ln(4) → negative infinite.

But then, the entire integral becomes 32 * (-1/2) [ (negative infinite) ].

Wait, but 32*(-1/2) is -16, multiplied by a negative infinite gives positive infinite. So the integral of r dr/(4-r²) is approaching infinity.

Wait, but that can't be right. Maybe I
