Alright, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of electrostatics. Let me try to break it down step by step.

Okay, the problem says we have an isolated system of 13 identical particles, each with charge 2e. Oh wait, e is the elementary charge, right? So each has a charge of 2 times that. And their mass is negligible, so I don't have to worry about kinetic energy or anything like that—it's all about potential energy here.

Now, the setup: 12 of these charges are constrained to stay at 2 meters from a point P. Point P is where the 13th charge is fixed. I need to find the minimum energy of this system. Hmm, minimum energy... wait, energy in electrostatic systems is usually potential energy. Since we're talking about a system of charges, the potential energy between them is what's important here.

Wait, but there are two charges at point P? No, no—the 13th charge is fixed at P, so it's just one charge at P and 12 around it, all at a distance of 2 meters from P. So the 12 are arranged in a spherical shell perhaps? Or maybe just placed at points 2m away, but their exact arrangement might not matter in terms of potential energy if they're all at the same distance. Because for potential energy calculations, each pair contributes, right.

So, the potential energy of a system of charges is the sum of the potential energies of each pair. But wait, how many pairs do I have here? Let's think.

The 13th charge is fixed at P. So it interacts with each of the 12 charges. Each of those 12 charges also interacts with each other. So I have two parts to the potential energy: the energy due to the interactions between the 13th charge and the 12, and the energy due to the interactions between the 12 themselves.

But wait, wait. Since the system is isolated, and we're considering all the charges, but the 13th is fixed. Oh, but wait, the potential energy is a property of the system as a whole. So
