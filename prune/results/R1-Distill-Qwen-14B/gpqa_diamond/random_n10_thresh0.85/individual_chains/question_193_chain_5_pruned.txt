Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me try to break it down.

The question says that in a specific region of the sky, the number of stars varies with parallax as 1 over plx to the fifth power. Hmm, I remember that parallax is related to distance. Oh right, parallax (plx) is the reciprocal of distance. So plx = 1/d, where d is distance. Wait, but wait, actually, the formula is plx = 1/d in parsecs, right? So if distance is d parsecs, then plx is 1/d.

So the number of stars N is proportional to 1/plx^5. That would mean N ∝ 1/(plx)^5. Since plx is 1/d, substituting that in, it becomes N ∝ (d)^5. So N is proportional to d^5, or N ∝ d^5.

But wait, the question is asking how the number of stars changes with distance per unit range. Oh, so they want the change in N with respect to distance. So maybe I should think in terms of differential change. Or perhaps more simply, how does N depend on d?

Wait, the way the question is phrased: "how does the number of stars... change with distance (per unit range of distance, r)?" So perhaps they're looking for dN/dr or something similar.

Wait, no. Let me think. If N is proportional to d^5, then the number of stars increases rapidly with distance. But wait, that doesn't seem right. Because when you go to larger distances, you're looking at a much larger volume, so more stars? But wait, if the number density is uniform, then the number of stars should be proportional to the volume, which is d^3. Hmm, but this problem is saying something different.

Wait, the given is that N varies as 1/plx^5. Since plx is 1/d, this implies N ∝ d^5. So N increases with the fifth power of distance. But that seems counterintuitive, because as you go further away, the same region of the sky would have fewer stars because each star is dimmer or something else? Or maybe the density increases? Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the way they're observing is that in a specific region, the number of stars varies with parallax as 1/(plx)^5. So perhaps in a volume element, the number of stars depends on how far away they are.

Wait, maybe it's better
