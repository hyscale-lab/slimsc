Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics question here. Let's see what it's about. Hmm, the question involves two quantum states with energies E1 and E2. Their lifetimes are given as 10^-9 seconds and 10^-8 seconds. I need to find their energy difference so that they can be clearly resolved. The options are A to D.

Wait, I'm a bit fuzzy on this. I remember that the energy-time uncertainty principle comes into play here. Oh right, the Heisenberg uncertainty principle. It states that the product of the uncertainty in energy (ΔE) and the uncertainty in time (Δt) is at least ħ/2, where ħ is the reduced Planck's constant.

So, the formula is ΔE * Δt ≈ ħ/2. Or maybe it's just an inequality, like ΔE Δt ≥ ħ/(2π) or something like that. I'm not entirely sure about the exact coefficient, but for this problem, maybe it's sufficient to know that a smaller uncertainty in time leads to a larger uncertainty in energy, and vice versa.

Wait, the question is about distinguishing two energy levels. So, the energy difference between E1 and E2 must be larger than the uncertainty in energy for each state. Because if the energy difference is smaller than the uncertainty, you can't distinguish them—they'd appear as a single energy level.

So each state has its own lifetime, which I think corresponds to the uncertainty in time, Δt. So for each state, their ΔE would be ħ/(Δt), or something like that. But wait, the question is about the energy difference between E2 and E1. So, the energy difference should be greater than the uncertainties of both states? Or perhaps just the maximum of the two? Or maybe the sum?

Wait, no. Let me think again. The uncertainty principle applies to each state individually. So for each state, the uncertainty in energy is inversely proportional to its lifetime. The longer the lifetime (the more precisely the energy is known), the smaller the uncertainty.

So for the first state with lifetime τ1 = 1e-9 sec, the uncertainty ΔE1 is roughly ħ/(τ1). Similarly, for τ2 = 1e-8 sec, ΔE2 is ħ/(τ2). Wait, but since τ2 is longer, ΔE2 is smaller than ΔE1.

Wait, the energy difference between E2 and E1 must be larger than both ΔE1 and ΔE2, right? Because if the energy separation is larger than the uncertainty in each, you can distinguish them. Because if the separation is smaller than one of the uncertainties, then you can't tell them apart.

Alternatively, perhaps the energy difference just needs to be larger than the maximum of the two uncertainties. Let me see.

Suppose the energy difference ΔE is the difference E2 - E1. To resolve them, ΔE must be greater than the uncertainty in energy for each state. Because if ΔE is smaller than either, then you wouldn't be able to distinguish them.

So, let me compute the uncertainties for each state.

The general formula I think is ΔE ≈ ħ / (τ), where τ is the lifetime. But wait, the actual formula is ΔE * τ ≈ ħ. So ΔE ≈ ħ/(τ).

But what's the value of ħ? Oh, right, ħ is approximately 1.0545718e-34 J·s. But wait, the problem gives the options in eV, so I should probably convert ħ into eV·s.

I remember that 1 eV is 1.602e-19 joules. So, let me compute ħ in eV·s.

So, ħ ≈ 1.0545718e-34 J·s. To convert to eV·s, divide by 1.602e-19 J/eV.

So, ħ ≈ (1.05457e-34) / (1.602e-19) eV·s ≈ approximately 6.582e-16 eV·s.

So, for each state:

ΔE1 ≈ ħ / τ1 = (6.582e-16 eV·s) / (1e-9 s) ) = 6.582e-7 eV.

Similarly, ΔE2 ≈ ħ / τ2 = (6.582e-16) / (1e-8) ) = 6.582e-8 eV.

So, ΔE1 is about 6.58e-7 eV, and ΔE2 is about 6.58e-8 eV.

Wait, but wait, the question is about the energy difference between the two states. So, E2 - E1 must be greater than the maximum of the two uncertainties. Because if it's less than either, you can't distinguish.

Wait, no—actually, I think the energy difference needs to be larger than the uncertainty in energy of each state. Because if the difference is smaller than the uncertainty of one of them, then you can't tell them apart. For example, if ΔE < ΔE1, then because E1's uncertainty is large, the states might overlap in their energy distributions.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. The key point is that the energy difference should be greater than the uncertainty in energy for each state. So, the energy difference must be greater than both ΔE1 and ΔE2. So, the minimum required would be greater than the maximum of ΔE1 and ΔE2.

Looking at the numbers, ΔE1 is about 6.58e-7 eV, and ΔE2 is 6.58e-8 eV. So ΔE1 is larger. So, the energy difference must be greater than 6.58e-7 eV.

Now, let's look at the options.

Option A: 1e-9 eV = 0.001e-7 eV → 1e-9 eV is 1e-9, which is way smaller
