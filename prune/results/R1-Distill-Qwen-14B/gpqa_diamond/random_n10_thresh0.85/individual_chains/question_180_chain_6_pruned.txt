Okay, so I have this physics problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me read it again carefully.

The question is about an isolated system of 13 identical particles, each with a charge of 2e. Their mass is negligible, so I don't have to worry about kinetic energy or anything like that. Now, 12 of these charges are constrained to stay at a distance of 2 meters from a point P. The 13th charge is fixed at point P. I need to find the minimum energy of this system, correct to three decimal places, and choose the right option from A to D.

Hmm, okay. So, I remember that the potential energy in an electric system comes from the interactions between charges. Since all these particles are identical and have the same charge, they will repel each other. But wait, the 13th charge is fixed at point P, and the other 12 are at 2 meters away.

Wait, but all 13 are identical and each has charge 2e. So the fixed charge at P is 2e, and the other 12 are each 2e as well. So, the setup is that there's a central charge and 12 charges around it in some configuration?

Wait, no. The question says 12 are constrained at 2m from P, and the 13th is fixed at P. So the 13th is at P, so it's a single point charge, and the other 12 are located on a sphere of radius 2 meters around P.

Wait, but the 13th is also a charge,
