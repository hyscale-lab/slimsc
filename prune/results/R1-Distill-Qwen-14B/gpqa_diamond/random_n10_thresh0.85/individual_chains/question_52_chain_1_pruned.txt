Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

Alright, the problem involves a star with certain characteristics—radius and mass, but more importantly, it's about the effective temperature when spots are present and how that affects the ratio of neutral Titanium (Ti) atoms in two energy levels. Hmm, right, I remember that the ratio of populations in energy levels can be explained using the Boltzmann equation. 

So, let me break it down. The star's normal effective temperature (Teff) is 6000 K without spots. When 40% of its surface is covered by spots, the overall Teff drops to 5500 K. Wait, but how does that work? Oh, right, the spots are cooler regions, so when a significant portion of the surface is covered, the star's overall brightness (and hence effective temperature) decreases. But the question focuses on the photosphere when spots are present. So the photospheric temperature is what's relevant for the Ti levels.

The problem says that the ratio of the number of neutral Ti atoms in two energy levels (level 1 and 2) decreases when the star has spots. Wait, the ratio decreases. So normally, without spots, the ratio is higher. Let me think about how the ratio is calculated.

The Boltzmann equation relates the ratio of the number of atoms in two energy levels to the temperature. The formula is (n2/n1) = (g2/g1) * exp( - (E2 - E1)/(k*T) ), where g is the statistical weight (degeneracy), E is energy, k is Boltzmann's constant, and T is the temperature. 

But wait, in this case, the ratio is n1/n2 perhaps? Because when the temperature changes, the ratio changes. The problem says that the ratio decreases when the star has spots. So, when the star has spots, the Teff is lower. The ratio n1/n2 would be (g1/g2) * exp( (E2 - E1)/(kT) ). Since when T decreases, the exponential term changes. 

Wait, the transition is between level 1 and level 2. Let me clarify which is higher in energy. The transition corresponds to a wavelength of about 1448 Å. Let me compute the photon energy. E = hc/λ. But maybe that's not necessary right now. Let's think about whether the transition is from higher to lower (emission) or lower to higher (absorption). But perhaps that's not the main point here. 

Wait, the problem says the ratio n1/n2 decreases when the star has spots. So, when the star has spots, the photosphere is cooler (5500 K). So, we need to find the ratio (n1/n2) when T is 6000 K and when T is 5500 K, and find the factor by which it changes.

Wait, n1 is the lower energy level, n2 the higher. Because when T increases, the higher energy level becomes more populated. So the ratio n1/n2 would decrease when T increases because more atoms are in the higher level. But in the problem, when the star has spots, T is lower. So n1/n2 would increase if T decreases, because lower T makes the higher energy level less populated. Oh, but the problem says that the ratio decreases when the star has spots. So when T decreases, the ratio n1/n2 is lower. Hmm, that doesn't fit with my initial thought.

Wait, maybe I got the ratio backwards. Let me re-clarify.

The ratio of the number of atoms in levels 1 and 2 is (n1/n2) = (g1/g2) * exp( (E2 - E1)/(k T) )

If E2 > E1, then (E2 - E1) is positive. So when T increases, the exponent becomes a smaller number (since denominator is kT), thus the exponential term decreases. So (n1/n2) decreases as T increases. 

But the problem states that when the star has spots, the ratio decreases. So the ratio is lower when T is lower? That can't be right because according to the equation, when T decreases, the exponent (E2-E1)/(kT) becomes larger (since T is in denominator), so the exponential term increases. So (n1/n2) increases when T decreases. But the problem says the ratio decreases when the star has spots, which is when T is lower. That seems contradictory. So perhaps I'm misunderstanding which level is which.

Wait, maybe the ratio is (n2/n1). So (n2/n1) = (g2/g1) exp( -(E2 - E1)/(k T) )

If E2 > E1, then (E2 - E1) is positive. So, as T increases, the exponent becomes less negative, so exp(-x) becomes larger. So (n2/n1) increases with T. 

If the observed ratio is (n2/n1) and it decreases when the star has spots, that would mean when T decreases, the ratio goes down. Which makes sense. Because when T is lower, the higher energy level is less populated relative to the lower one.

So perhaps the ratio they're looking at is (n2/n1). Let's assume that the observed ratio (n2/n1) decreases when the star has spots. So when T is 5500 K, (n2/n1) is lower than when T is 6000 K.

Wait, but the question says the ratio of the number of Ti atoms in levels 1 and 2 decreases when the star has spots. So it's (n1/n2) that is decreasing. Because when T decreases, (n1/n2) increases. But according to the problem, (n1/n2) decreases.

So either I'm getting it wrong, or maybe the energy levels are such that E1 > E2, which would mean (n1/n2) = (g1/g2) exp( (E2 - E1)/(k T) ) would be (g1/g2) exp(- (E1 - E2)/(k T) )

Wait, that makes sense. Because if E1 is higher than E2, then (E2 - E1) is negative, so the exponent is negative multiplied by T, which is positive. So as T increases, the exponent becomes less negative, so exp(-x) becomes larger, leading to a larger (n1/n2). Hmm, but that might complicate things.

Alternatively, perhaps I should just proceed with the given information. The key point is that when the star has spots, the Teff is lower (5500 K), and the ratio (n1/n2) is lower.

But according to the Boltzmann equation, if T decreases, and E2 > E1, then (n1/n2) would increase, because the exponent (E2-E1)/(kT) becomes larger in magnitude (since T is smaller), so exp(-x) becomes smaller, leading (n1/n2) to be smaller. Wait, wait, perhaps I'm getting confused.

Wait, let's write the equation again. Let me define (n1/n2) = (g1/g2) * exp( (E2 - E1) / (k T) )

Assuming E2 > E1, so (E2 - E1) is positive.

So, when T increases, (E2 - E1)/(k T) becomes smaller (since T is in denominator), so the exponent is smaller, so exp(small positive) is larger, but since it's in the numerator, (n
