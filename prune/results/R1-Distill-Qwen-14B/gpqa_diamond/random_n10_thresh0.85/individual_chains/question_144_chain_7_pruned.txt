Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about meson resonance decay. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through. So the question is asking for the mean decay distance of a meson X. The given parameters are the production energy E_X = 8 GeV, mass m_X = 1.2 GeV, and width Γ_X = 320 MeV. The options are A to D, all in terms of 10^-15 or 10^-16 meters. 

Wait, I remember that the decay length is related to the particle's lifetime and its velocity. Oh right, the mean decay distance (L) should be the product of the lifetime (τ) and the velocity (βc), where β is the speed in terms of the speed of light. So L = βcτ.

But how do I find the lifetime? Oh, right, the width Γ relates to the lifetime via the uncertainty principle. The width Γ is the total decay width, and the lifetime τ is inversely proportional to Γ. Specifically, τ = ħ / Γ. But wait, since we're working in natural units where ħ = c = 1, that's probably how the formula is structured.

Wait, but I think I need to make sure about the units. Let me think. Γ is given in MeV, which is energy units. Hmm, but when calculating τ, you need to convert GeV to appropriate units. Or maybe it's easier to convert everything into compatible units.

Wait, another approach: the mean lifetime τ is given by τ = ħ / Γ. Since ħ is approximately 6.582 × 10^-25 GeV·s. Wait, because ħ is about 6.582×10^-25 GeV·seconds (since 1 GeV is 1e9 eV, and Planck constants are involved).

So, Γ is 320 MeV, which is 0.32 GeV. So τ = 6.582e-25 GeV·s / 0.32 GeV. Let me compute that. 6.582e-25 / 0.32 ≈ 2.056875e-24 seconds.

Wait, but I need to think about this. Alternatively, I've heard of the formula τ = (ħ c) / (m Γ). Wait, no, that doesn't sound right. Let me clarify. The natural line width formula is Γ = ħ / τ, so τ = ħ / Γ. But when you have relativistic particles, the lifetime you use is the proper lifetime, which is τ. Then, the decay length is L = vγτ. Because the particle is moving at velocity v, and γ is the Lorentz factor.

Oh wait, γ is 1/sqrt(1 - (v^2/c^2)) ), which for high energies can be approximated. But let's get back. So first, I need to compute τ, then find v, then compute L = vτ.

Wait, but which velocity do I take? The velocity of the meson. So the meson's energy is given as E_X = 8 GeV, and its mass is m_X = 1.2 GeV. So the energy is higher than the mass, which makes sense.

The energy E is related to the momentum p and mass via E^2 = (pc)^2 + (m c^2)^2. Solving for p, we get p = sqrt( (E^2 - (m c^2)^2) ) / c^2.

But since we're in natural units where c=1, perhaps the formula simplifies. Let me see, with c=1, E^2 = p^2 + m^2. So p = sqrt(E^2 - m^2) = sqrt(8^2 - 1.2^2) GeV. Let me compute that. 8^2 is 64, 1.2^2 is 1.44, so 64-1.44=62.56. sqrt(62.56) is about 7.91 GeV. So p ≈ 7.91 GeV/c.

Wait, but since we're using natural units, maybe we don't need to worry about c in some expressions. Hmm.

The velocity β is v/c = p c / E. So in natural units, v = p c / E. Wait, but if c is taken as 1, then v = p / E. So p is 7.91 GeV, E is 8 GeV, so β = 7.91 / 8 ≈ 0.98875. So β is approximately 0.98875.

So β is about 0.98875, which is pretty close to the speed of light. So the meson is moving at a high velocity.

Now, let's get back to the lifetime. τ = ħ / Γ. Γ is 0.32 GeV. So using ħ = 6.582e-25 GeV·s, τ = 6.582e-25 / 0.32 = approx 2.056875e-24 seconds.

Then, the mean decay length L is β c τ. Wait, wait, no: L is (β c) * τ? Or is it (β c) multiplied by the lifetime multiplied by gamma? Hmm, because the lifetime is the proper time, and moving from proper time to lab frame time would require gamma. But wait, no: the mean lifetime as measured in the lab frame is tau multiplied by gamma. Because moving clocks run slower. So the lifetime in the lab frame is gamma * tau.

Wait, so the decay process happens over a proper time tau. But from the lab frame, the time is longer by gamma, so the observed lifetime is gamma * tau. Therefore, the decay distance L is v * (gamma * tau). Alternatively, since
