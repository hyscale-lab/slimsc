Okay, so I've got this question about quantum states and density matrices. Hmm, I remember that a density matrix is used to describe the state of a quantum system, especially when it's mixed or in a statistical ensemble. The question provides a specific density matrix and asks about its geometrical position in qubit space. The options are given as points in 3D space, so I need to figure out how the density matrix maps to a vector in that space.

The given density matrix is ρ = (1/2)(|0><0| + |1><1|). Wait, that looks familiar. Oh, right! This is actually a classical mixture of the states |0> and |1>, each with equal probability. Because the density matrix is a statistical mixture, this would be a completely mixed state for a single qubit.

I remember that in the Bloch sphere representation, pure states are on the surface of the sphere, and mixed states are inside. The Bloch vector r describes the state as a point in 3D space. For a pure state |ψ>, the density matrix is |ψ><ψ|, which corresponds to a point on the Bloch sphere. But for a mixed state, the Bloch vector is scaled down by the purity of the state.

Since ρ here is a mixture of |0> and |1>, each with 50% probability, the state is completely mixed. The Bloch vector for a completely mixed state should be at the origin because there's no coherence and the state is maximally mixed. So, r = (0,0,0). 

Wait, let me think again. The standard basis states |0> and |1> correspond to the points (1,0,0) and (-1,0,0) on the Bloch sphere, but when you take the average of these states without any coherences, the vector would be at the origin. Because the density matrix is (|0><0| + |1><1|)/2, which is the same as the maximally mixed state I = (|0><0| + |1><1| + |+><+| + ... etc.) no, wait, I think I got that wrong. Wait, no, I is the identity matrix, which is the maximally mixed state. So yes, the state ρ in the question is I/2, which is the completely mixed state, so the Bloch vector r is (0,0,0).

Looking at the options, option C is (0,0,0), so that's the correct one. The other options probably correspond to pure states or other mixed states. For example, option B is (0,0,1) which would be |+y> state or something, but in this case, the state is maximally mixed, so origin.


The given density matrix is 

\[
\rho = \frac{1}{2} \left( |0\rangle \langle 0| + |1\rangle \langle 1| \right).
\]

This represents a classical mixture of the states \(|0\rangle\) and \(|1\rangle\), each with equal probability. In the Bloch sphere representation, pure states are on the surface of the sphere, while mixed states are inside. For a completely mixed state like this one, the Bloch vector \(r\) is at the origin because there are no coherences, and the state is maximally mixed.

The other options correspond to different states:  
- **A) \(r = (1,1,0)\):** This would correspond to a pure state with specific coherences, but this is not the case here.  
- **B) \(r = (0,0,1):** This corresponds to a pure state like \(|+y\rangle\), which is not relevant here.  
- **D) \(r = (1,1,1):** This is not a valid state on the Bloch sphere.  

Thus, the correct geometrical position of the density matrix in qubit space is \(r = (0,0,0)\).

Answer: C
