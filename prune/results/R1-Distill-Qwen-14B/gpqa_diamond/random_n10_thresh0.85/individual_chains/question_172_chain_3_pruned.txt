Okay, so I've got this question about stars and iron atoms in their photospheres. Let me try to break it down.

The question says that the iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited as those in star_2. I remember that in stars, the excitation of atoms is related to their temperature. Oh right, the Boltzmann distribution comes into play here. The distribution tells us how particles are distributed among different energy states based on temperature.

The energy difference between the levels is given as 1.38e-23 J. Wait, 1.38 is a familiar number—Boltzmann's constant is 1.38e-23 J/K. So the energy difference ΔE is k_B * something. Hmm, wait, maybe ΔE is given as 1.38e-23, which is exactly k_B. So ΔE = k_B * T * something? Or perhaps the ratio of the populations.

The Boltzmann factor is (g2/g1) * exp(-ΔE/(k_B T)), where g's are the statistical weights. If the energy level in star_1 is twice as excited, that would mean the population ratio N1/N2 is 2. Or wait, maybe it's N1/N2 equals 2. Or wait, star_1 has higher excitation, so N1 (excited state) is higher than N2 (ground state) in star_1. But wait, the question says "twice as excited in a specific energy level when compared to star_2." So for a specific energy level, like the excited state, the number of atoms in that state is twice as much in star_1 as in star_2.

Wait, maybe more accurately, the excitation is such that the ratio of the number of atoms in a higher energy level to a lower one is proportional to exp(-ΔE/(k_B T)). So if the energy difference is ΔE, then the ratio of populations (like N_high / N_low) is proportional to exp(-ΔE/(k_B T)).

In this problem, let's say the excited state is E2 and the lower is E1. So E2 > E1, ΔE = E2 - E1 = 1.38
