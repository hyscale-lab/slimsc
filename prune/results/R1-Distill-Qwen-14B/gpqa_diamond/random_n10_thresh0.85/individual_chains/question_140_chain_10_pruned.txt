Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit stuck, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read it again and see what I can figure out.

The question is about a substance X reacting with liquid Y. The reaction releases a gas W, which has a molecule where the number of neutrons equals the number of protons. Also, a precipitate G forms, which when heated releases B. The melting point of B under normal conditions is close to 277 K. Then, there's something about a keto acid reacting with X to produce a product with two oxygen atoms. Finally, I need to find the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements in X, considering isotopes.

Hmm, okay, let's break this down. First, I think I should identify what each of these substances could be.

Starting with the reaction: X reacts violently with Y to produce gas W, precipitate G, and maybe some other products. The melting point of B is about 277 K. Let me think about common substances that melt around that temperature. Wait, 277 K is roughly 4 degrees Celsius. I remember that ice melts at 0 degrees C, and maybe something like ammonium nitrate or another crystallizing solid could have a melting point around there. Alternatively, maybe B is water? No, because water freezes at 273 K, which is 0 C, but 277 is a bit higher. Hmm, maybe B is another compound.

Wait, but when G is heated, it releases B. So G is probably a compound that, upon heating, decomposes into B. What if G is something like calcium carbonate? No, when heated, it decomposes into calcium oxide and carbon dioxide. But that might not fit.

Another angle: the gas W has the same number of neutrons and protons. Let's think about possible gases. The molecule of W must have equal neutrons and protons. So let's think about what elements or molecules fit that.

Wait, the simplest case is a molecule where each atom has equal protons and neutrons. For example, H has 1 proton and 0 neutrons in H-1, but maybe another isotope. Or perhaps a molecule where each atom contributes equally. Wait, but if it's a molecule like O2, each O atom has 8 protons. Neutrons per O would vary based on isotope. For example, O-16 has 8 neutrons. So O2 would have 16 neutrons and 16 protons (since 8 each from two atoms). That fits the condition. But O2 is a gas, but does the problem say W is O2? I'm not sure yet.

Another possibility is CO2. Carbon has 6 protons, oxygen has 8. But the molecule would have (6 + 8*2) protons, which is 22; neutrons would be based on isotopes. But the problem says the molecule has same number of protons and neutrons. Hmm, maybe that's not it.

Wait, maybe W is NH3? No, because N has 7 protons, H has 1 each. Let's see, NH3 has 7 + 3 = 10 protons. If each N is say N-14, which has 7 neutrons, and H is H-1, then the total neutrons would be 7 (N) + 3*0 (H) =7. But 7â‰ 10, so that doesn't fit. Hmm
