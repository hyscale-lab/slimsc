Okay, so I've got this question here about a metric and finding the area of a pseudosphere with radius 2. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my general relativity and differential geometry, but let me try to think this through.

The metric given is ds² = (32)/(4 - x² - y²) (dx² + dy²). Wait, that looks like a two-dimensional metric because it's in terms of dx and dy. So this is a 2-dimensional spacetime? Or maybe a 3D surface? I think it's a 2D surface because it's in two variables, x and y.

Pseudosphere... Oh right, a pseudosphere is a surface with constant negative curvature. But wait, the term 'pseudosphere' sometimes refers to a specific shape, like the tractricoid, which is the surface of revolution of a tractrix. But in the context of general relativity, the pseudosphere might refer to a spacetime with negative curvature, like anti-de Sitter space or something similar.

Wait, but the question is about the area of the pseudosphere of radius r=2. So perhaps this metric describes a pseudosphere, and we need to compute its area.

I remember that for a metric in 2D, the area can be found using the square root of the determinant of the metric tensor multiplied by the integration element. But wait, the metric here is given in terms of dx and dy. So let me write out the metric tensor components.

The metric ds² can be written as g_{xx} dx² + g_{yy} dy² + cross terms. But here, since it's diagonal, the cross terms are zero. So g_{xx} = g_{yy} = 32/(4 - x² - y²). So the metric tensor
