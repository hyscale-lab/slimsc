Okay, so I've got this question about the Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT) and the symmetries that operators must respect. Hmm, let me think. I remember that SMEFT is built by adding higher-dimensional operators to the Standard Model, but these operators are constrained by some symmetries.

The question asks which symmetries must be respected by all operators in SMEFT. The options are Lorentz, Poincare, CP, and CPT. Let's break them down.

First, I know that Lorentz symmetry is a big one. The Standard Model preserves Lorentz symmetry, so any operators added in SMEFT must also respect that. Otherwise, they would introduce non-Lorentz-invariant terms, which I think aren't allowed because SMEFT is an effective theory that maintains the same symmetries as the SM at low energies. So Lorentz symmetry (1) is definitely required.

Next, Poincare symmetry. Poincare includes Lorentz symmetry plus translations. Since the SM respects Poincare, SMEFT should too. Wait, but wait a second. Effective theories can sometimes include operators that break certain symmetries, but SMEFT is constructed in a way that maintains the same symmetries as the SM. So Poincare symmetry (2) must also be respected. Or wait, isn't Poincare symmetry part of Lorentz? No, Poincare is a larger group, including translations. So if the SM respects Poincare, SMEFT must as well. So both Lorentz and Poincare symmetries are required.

Then, CP symmetry (3). I'm a bit fuzzy here. I remember that the Standard Model isn't CP-symmetric because of the CKM mechanism. So operators in SMEFT can actually violate CP. Wait, but wait, do the SMEFT operators have to preserve CP? Or can they have terms that break it? I think that SMEFT doesn't require operators to respect CP because the SM already has CP violation. So operators in SMEFT can include terms that break CP. So CP symmetry (3) isn't necessarily required. So operators don't have to respect it.

CPT symmetry (4). Now, CPT is a big one in quantum field theory. I remember that all Lorentz-invariant theories must respect CPT symmetry. Because that's a fundamental symmetry in QFT. So SMEFT, being a Lorentz-invariant theory, must respect CPT. So even though operators might violate other symmetries like CP, they must preserve CPT.

Let me recap. Operators must respect Lorentz (1) and CPT (4). Poincare (2) is part of Lorentz? Wait, no. Wait, Lorentz symmetry includes rotations and boosts. Poincare includes Lorentz and translations. So if a theory respects Poincare, it respects Lorentz. But vice versa? If it respects Lorentz, does it automatically respect translations? Not necessarily, unless the theory is invariant under translations, which requires that the Lagrangian has no explicit dependence on position (like global symmetry). So if the SMEFT respects Poincare, it must also respect translations. But wait, is that a given?

Wait, SMEFT is an effective theory that's Lorentz-invariant. So it must respect Lorentz. But Poincare includes translations. Hmm, but if the theory is Lorentz invariant, does it automatically respect translations? Or does it have separate considerations? I think that Poincare symmetry is a separate condition. For example, a theory can be Lorentz symmetric but not translationally symmetric. But in the context of SMEFT, since it's designed to be an effective theory of the SM, which is Poincare-invariant, SMEFT must also respect Poincare. So both 1 and 2 are required.

Wait, but in SMEFT, the operators are classified by their Lorentz indices, etc., but do they have to respect Poincare? Poincare includes the momentum (translation) generators. So the theory must have a Poincare-invariant S-matrix, which is a given because it's built from the SM's framework, which is already Poincare-invariant. So yes, SMEFT operators must respect Poincare symmetry. So 2 is also a must.

So putting this together: which symmetries must all SMEFT operators respect? 1 (Lorentz), 2 (Poincare), and 4 (CPT). Wait, but Lorentz is part of Poincare? Or are they separate? So the question lists 1 and 2 as separate options.

Wait, the question is about which symmetries must be respected by all operators. If a theory respects Poincare, it automatically respects Lorentz. But if it respects Lorentz, does it respect Poincare? Not necessarily unless it's translationally invariant as well. So for SMEFT, which is a Lorentz-invariant theory, but to have Poincare, you need more. Since SMEFT is built on top of the SM, which is Poincare-invariant, I think SMEFT must respect both. But wait, the question asks which symmetries must be respected by all operators. So 1 and 2 might both be required.

Wait, but looking at the options, option C is 1,2,4. Option A is 1,2. So if both 1 and 2 are required, which they are, plus CPT (4) is also required. Because CPT is a separate symmetry that's automatically respected due to being a Lorentz-invariant theory.

So the operators must respect Lorentz (1), Poincare (2), and CPT (4). But wait, does Poincare require that the theory is also CPT-symmetric? Or is CPT separate?

Wait, CPT symmetry is a combination of charge conjugation, parity, and time reversal. Poincare is about spacetime symmetries (translations, Lorentz boosts, rotations, etc.). So these are different. Therefore, SMEFT must respect all three: Lorentz (1), Poincare (2), and CPT (4). But wait, if Poincare is already a symmetry, does that imply CPT? I don't think so. CPT is separate. So yes, CPT is a separate symmetry that must be respected.

Wait, but I'm getting confused. Because CPT is a symmetry that's required for any Lorentz-invariant theory with a unitary S-matrix. So if the theory is Lorentz-invariant, it should respect CPT. So even if SMEFT respects Lorentz, it must also respect CPT. So all operators must respect CPT.

Therefore, the required symmetries are Lorentz (1), Poincare (2), and CPT (4). But looking at the options, option C is 1,2,4. So the correct answer would be option C.

Wait, but wait. Another angle: does the SMEFT Lagrangian respect all these symmetries? I remember that in SMEFT, operators are classified by their Lorentz indices, so Lorentz symmetry is definitely a must. Poincare symmetry, since the SM respects it, SMEFT must as well. But wait, wait, no—when you add higher-dimensional operators, do they automatically respect Poincare? Or do the operators need to be constructed in a way that preserves it?

Alternatively, perhaps the SMEFT operators are written in a way that maintains Lorentz symmetry but not necessarily Poincare. But I don't think that's the case. Because SMEFT is an effective theory that's Lorentz and Poincare invariant, so the operators must respect both.

Wait, but wait again. Poincare includes translations, which relate to momentum. For a theory to be Poincare-invariant, the Lagrangian must be translation-invariant, meaning it can't have explicit dependence on position. So SMEFT operators, which are part of a translation-invariant Lagrangian, respect Poincare.

So, putting it all together, the correct answer must include Lorentz (1), Poincare (2), and CPT (4). Looking at the options, option C is 1,2,4 (so 1,2,4 are correct). The other options: option A is only 1 and 2, which misses CPT. So the correct answer is C.


To determine which symmetries must be respected by all operators in the Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT), we analyze the given options:

1. **Lorentz Symmetry**: SMEFT is built as an effective theory of the Standard Model (SM), which respects Lorentz symmetry. Therefore, all operators in SMEFT must preserve Lorentz symmetry.

2. **Poincaré Symmetry**: Poincaré symmetry includes both Lorentz symmetry and translation symmetry. Since the SM respects Poincaré symmetry, SMEFT must also respect it. This ensures that the operators are part of a translation-invariant Lagrangian.

3. **CP Symmetry**: The SM already violates CP symmetry due to the CKM mechanism. SMEFT operators are allowed to include terms that break CP symmetry, meaning CP symmetry is not a strict requirement for all operators in SMEFT.

4. **CPT Symmetry**: CPT symmetry is a fundamental property of Lorentz-invariant quantum field theories. Since SMEFT is Lorentz-invariant, it must also respect CPT symmetry.

From this analysis, the symmetries that must be respected by all operators in SMEFT are Lorentz symmetry (1), Poincaré symmetry (2), and CPT symmetry (4). The correct option is **C) 1,2,4**.
