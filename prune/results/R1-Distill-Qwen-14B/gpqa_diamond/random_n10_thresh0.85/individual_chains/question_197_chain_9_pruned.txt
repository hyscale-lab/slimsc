Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm not too confident with all these spectroscopic techniques, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question says.

The question is about identifying the product formed when Compound X reacts with red phosphorus and HI. The options are A, B, C, D. I need to figure out what Compound X is first, right? Because knowing the starting material will help me determine the reaction outcome.

The data given are the IR and 1H NMR spectra of Compound X. Let's start by looking at the IR data. The peaks are at 3400–2500, which usually indicates an -OH stretch (like in a carboxylic acid) or maybe an NH group, but more likely an -OH here. Wait, but wait, sometimes alcohols or amines can have O-H or N-H stretches, but in this case, the 3400–2500 is a broad region, so maybe it's an -OH from a carboxylic acid or maybe an alcohol. Alternatively, maybe an alkyne C-H stretch, but that's usually around 3300, so maybe not. Hmm.

Looking further, there's a peak at 1720 cm-1. That's a strong peak, which is typical for a carbonyl group, like a ketone, aldehyde, ester, or carboxylic acid. Since in the 1720 region, carboxylic acids have a strong O-H stretch around 2500-3300 (broad), which is present here. So maybe Compound X is a carboxylic acid. Alternatively, maybe an ester, but the IR here would have the ester carbonyl around 1720 and maybe an O-H from another source. Wait, but if it's an ester, the O-H would be from an alcohol, but that's a possibility. But looking at the NMR, let's see.

The NMR has a peak at 10.5 ppm (bs, 1H). A singlet around 10.5 ppm is usually a carbonyl proton, like an aldehyde, but wait, aldehydes are usually around 9-10 ppm. Also, a singlet suggests no adjacent protons. Wait, but wait—carboxylic acids have an -OH proton, which is usually a broad peak around 10-12 ppm, right? So a broad singlet at 10.5 ppm might be an -OH from a carboxylic acid. So that's pointing towards a carboxylic acid group.

So, if X is a carboxylic acid, then reacting with red phosphorus and HI—wait, that's a common reaction for converting carboxylic acids into something else. Red phosphorus and HI is used for the Clemmensen reduction, right? Wait, no, Clemmensen is for reducing ketones to alkanes using Zn(Hg)/HCl and Hg. Wait, no, red phosphorus and HI is used for the reduction of esters or maybe nitriles? Wait, or maybe it's for the hydrolysis of nitriles, but I'm a bit confused. Wait, no, carboxylic acids reacting with red phosphorus and HI—I think that's a situation where the acid is converted into an alkane. Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let me think again.

Wait, the reaction of a carboxylic acid with red phosphorus and HI is the Eschweiler-Clarke reaction? No, wait, that's for amines. Maybe it's the reduction of the carboxylic acid to an alkane. So, the -COOH group would be reduced to a -CH2- group. So, if X is a benzoic acid derivative, then the product would have a CH2 group where the COOH was. But wait, wait, wait. Alternatively, perhaps X is an ester, and under those conditions, it could hydrolyze. Or maybe the reaction is a different one.

Alternatively, wait, red phosphorus and HI is used in the hydroboration reaction, but that's for alkenes. Alternatively, perhaps in the presence of HI, the compound undergoes some substitution if there are good leaving groups, like in an aromatic ring.

Wait, but perhaps I should figure out what X is first. Let's look at the NMR data again.

The 1H NMR has:

10.5 ppm (bs, 1H) → likely a carbonyl proton, perhaps as an aldehyde or a carboxylic acid -OH.

8.0 ppm (d, 2H) → aromatic protons, likely para-substituted. So a para-substituted benzene ring.

7.2 ppm (d, 2H) → more aromatic protons, which would fit with a para-substituted ring. So perhaps two substituents on the ring, but wait, if only two sets of doublets, maybe it's a meta or para substitution. But since both are doublets, and each is 2H, that suggests a disubstituted benzene with substituents opposite each other. So, for example, a para-substituted benzene with two substituents opposite each other. Alternatively, maybe it's a para-substituted ring with two groups on opposite positions.

Then, 2.9 ppm (m, 1H) → maybe an adjacent CH group, like a CH next to a carbonyl or another group.

1.7 ppm (m, 2H) → perhaps a CH2 group next to another CH2.

1.4 ppm (d, 3H) → a CH3 group attached to a CH, so maybe a isopropyl group or a tertiary carbon.

0.9 ppm (t, 3H) → a terminal CH3, like in an ethyl group.

So putting this together: the aromatic ring is para-substituted, and each substituent is a group that leads to these NMR signals.

Wait, but the first peak at 10.5 ppm is a singlet. If it's a carboxylic acid, then that would be the -OH proton. But in the NMR, the aromatic protons are at 8.0 and 7.2 ppm, which suggests that the substituents on the benzene are electron-withdrawing groups, like a carbonyl group, because that would deshield the protons. Alternatively, if it's an electron-donating group like an OMe, the protons would be upfield.

Wait, but let's think about the substituents. The IR has a peak at 1720 cm-1. So maybe the substituent is a carbonyl group attached to the benzene. So, perhaps it's a benzoic acid derivative.

So let's imagine the structure: a benzene ring with a substituent at the para position. Wait, but wait, looking at the NMR, the aromatic protons are two doublets, each integrating to 2H. So perhaps the substituent is in the para position, and each substituent is a group that's causing the aromatic protons to split into two sets. For example, if the substituent is a carbonyl group, like a COOH, then the ring would have two substituents? Or maybe the substituent is a group with a carbonyl, like a ketone or ester.

Wait, but in the NMR, integrating to 2H each for the two doublets suggests that the substituent is at a position that splits the ring into two sets of two protons each. So maybe a substituent on the benzene in the para position, and then another substituent in another position? Or perhaps a substituent that's attached in such a way that the ring has two doublets of two protons each.

Wait, if the substituent is a COOH group, then the ring would have a COOH in the para position. But then, looking at the aromatic protons, there's two doublets, each 2H. So, for a para-substituted benzene with a COOH group, the ortho and para protons would be split in a certain way.

Wait, maybe it's a benzene ring with a COOH group in the para position and another substituent, like an ethyl group or isobutyl group, elsewhere. Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a ketone or another group.

Wait, another approach: looking at the other NMR signals. The 2.9 ppm (m, 1H) could be a CH adjacent to a carbonyl group. For example, in a propanoic acid, the CH2 next to the carbonyl might have protons around 2.5 ppm, but maybe 2.9 is possible if there's some deshielding. Alternatively, it could be a CH group in an isopropyl substituent.

The 1.4 ppm (d, 3H) is a CH3 attached to a CH, as in an isopropyl group. So perhaps there's an isopropyl group attached as a substituent on the benzene ring.

The 0.9 ppm (t, 3H) is a CH2CH3 group, a terminal ethyl group. So maybe the substituent is an ethyl group attached to a CH.

Wait, putting this together, maybe the substituent on the benzene is an isobutyl group. Because an isobutyl group would have a CH(CH2CH3)2 structure, but wait, the 1.4 ppm is a d (doublet), which is a CH3 attached to a CH, which would be like an isopropyl group. Wait, but the 1.7 ppm is an m (multiplet) for 2H, perhaps CH2 groups.

Wait, let me think of the structure. If the substituent is an isopropyl group attached to the benzene, that might not explain all the signals. Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a propyl group, but that doesn't quite fit with the NMR.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the substituent is a propionyl group (COCH2CH2CH3), but that might not fit the NMR. Alternatively, maybe it's a benzyl group, but that seems unlikely.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is an isobutyl group. An isobutyl group would have a structure like CH2CH(CH2CH3)2, but wait, maybe not. Let me think again. An isobutyl group is CH2CH(CH2CH3). Wait, no, isobutyl is (CH2)2CHCH2–? No, wait, isobutyl is CH2CH(CH2CH3), but that's a substituent. Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a secondary butyl group, like -CH2CH(CH2CH3)2.

Wait, but another possibility: the substituent is a sec-butyl group. A sec-butyl group is CH2CH2CH(CH3)2? No, wait, sec-butyl is CH2CH(CH2CH3), but wait, no, correction: the structure of sec-butyl is CH2CH(CH2CH3)–, but perhaps that's not right. Actually, the structure of isobutyl is CH2CH(CH2CH3)–, but wait, I might be getting confused. Let me clarify: the isobutyl group is CH2CH(CH2CH3)–, while the sec-butyl group is CH2CH2CH(CH3)–, but that's not correct because that's more like a tert-butyl group. Hmm, perhaps I'm getting the substituents wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a propyl group attached in a certain way. Let me think about the NMR data again.

The NMR shows:

- 1H at 10.5 ppm (broad, probably -OH)
- 2H at 8.0 ppm (d)
- 2H at 7.2 ppm (d)
- 1H at 2.9 ppm (m)
- 2H at 1.7 ppm (m)
- 3H at 1.4 ppm (d)
- 3H at 0.9 ppm (t)

So, the substituent on the benzene ring must have a structure that includes an ethyl group (from the 0.9 ppm triplet) and perhaps a CH2 group.

Wait, the 0.9 ppm triplet (3H) is likely a CH2CH3 group. The 1.4 ppm doublet (3H) is a CH3 attached to a CH, so maybe a CH(CH3)2 group. The 1.7 ppm multiplet (2H) would be a CH2 attached to something else. And the 2.9 ppm multiplet (1H) would be a CH attached to a carbonyl or another group.

Putting this together, perhaps the substituent is an isobutyl group, which would have a structure like CH2CH(CH2CH3)2. Wait, no, perhaps it's more like CH2CH(CH2CH3) attached to the benzene. Alternatively, maybe it's a propyl group with a branching.

Wait, maybe the substituent is a butyl group, specifically a sec-butyl group. The structure of a sec-butyl group is CH2CH2CH(CH3)–, but that's not possible because that would be a tertiary butyl group. Wait, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Let me think again: the substituent is a butyl group attached to the benzene. The substituent could be a sec-butyl group, which would have a
