Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me read through it again and jot down the important details.

The question is about a star with the same radius as the Sun. So, R_star is solar radius, R_sun. The star has one hemisphere covered in dark spots, and the filling factor is 20%. Filling factor is like the area covered by spots, right? So 20% of the hemisphere is spots. Wait, no, wait. The filling factor is the fraction of the surface covered by spots. But the question says one hemisphere is covered, so maybe I need to clarify that. Hmm, maybe the total area of spots is 20% of the total surface. Or is it 20% of the hemisphere? Wait, the wording says "dark spots with a filling factor of 20%", so I think it means 20% of the star's surface is covered. But wait, the star's surface is a sphere, so the hemisphere is half the surface area. So if one hemisphere is spotty, but the filling factor is 20%... Wait, I might be mixing this up.

Wait, no. Filling factor refers to how much of the surface is covered by spots. So if the filling factor is 20%, then 20% of the entire star's surface is covered by spots. But the problem says that only one hemisphere is spotty. Oh, wait, no: "one hemisphere is covered in dark spots". So perhaps the spots are confined to one hemisphere, but within that hemisphere, the filling factor is 20%? Or is the entire star's spot coverage 20%? Hmm, the wording is a bit ambiguous.

Wait, the exact wording: "one hemisphere of the star is covered in dark spots with a filling factor of 20%." Oh, so the filling factor is 20% for the hemisphere. So the spots cover 20% of that hemisphere. But wait, the hemisphere is half the star's surface. So the total area covered by spots is 20% of the hemisphere's area. So the total spot area is 0.2 * (π R_star²), since the hemisphere's area is 2π R² / 2 = π R². Wait, actually, the area of a sphere is 4π R², so a hemisphere is 2π R². So 20% of that is 0.2 * 2π R² = 0.4π R². So the spots cover 0.4π R² of the star's surface.

Wait, but the star's entire surface is 4π R². So the filling factor for the entire star would be 0.4π R² /4π R² = 0.1, which is 10%. So the spots make up 10% of the star's surface. Hmm, but the way the question is phrased is a bit confusing. Alternatively, maybe the filling factor is 20% of the hemisphere, so the entire star's spot coverage is 20% * hemisphere area. Which as above, is 10% of the star's total surface. So the spot area is 0.2 * (hemisphere) = 0.2*(2π R²) = 0.4π R².

The star's Teff is 6000 K, and the spots are cooler, with a temperature difference of 1000 K. So the spot temperature is 5000 K. Or, wait, the question says the spots exhibit a temperature difference of 1000 K. So, the star's effective temperature is 6000 K, and the spots are 1000 K cooler? So T_spot = 5000 K.

Now, the scenario is that because the spots are on one hemisphere, when the star rotates, the spots come into and out of view from our perspective. So the brightness from the star as seen from Earth would vary, as the spots rotate into and out of the visible hemisphere. But in this case, the star's brightness variation is being mistaken for an exoplanet transit. Because when the planet transits in front of the star, it blocks some light, causing a dip in brightness. The problem says that the observed brightness variation is similar to what a planet would cause, so we're to find the planet
