Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about cobalt complexes and stability constants. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through.

The question says we have a solution with Co(II) ions and thiocyanate. The total cobalt concentration is 0.01 M, and the thiocyanate concentration is 0.1 M. The stability constants (beta) for the complexes are given as β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, and β4=16. We need to find the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes among all the cobalt species.

Wait, wait. Oh right, the dithiocyanato complex is probably [Co(SCN)_2]^something. But wait, the question specifies the blue ones. I remember that Co with different SCN counts can have different colors. The blue ones I think are the ones with four thiocyanate ions, but wait, no, maybe it's the [Co(SCN)_4]^2- or something else. Wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me think.

Wait, the options are about the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato complexes. Dithiocyanato would be two SCN groups attached, right? So [Co(SCN)_2]^n+? But the question says 'blue' which might be [Co(SCN)_4]^3- or [Co(SCN)_3]^2-? Hmm, I'm not entirely sure about the exact structure. But perhaps I should proceed with the given stability constants and see which complex is the predominant one.

Stability constants (beta) indicate the stability of a complex. Higher beta means a more stable complex. The stability constant is given by log K, so K = 10^β. But wait, for each beta, each successive step. So for each complex, the beta is the log of the formation constant from the previous step.

Wait, the stability constants are given for each possible complex. Let's think of the complexes as Co(SCN)_n^m+. So, for each n, the beta is the stepwise formation constant. So:

Co²+ + SCN^- → [CoSCN]^+ : beta1=9 → K1=1e9.

Then, [CoSCN]^+ + SCN^- → [Co(SCN)₂] : beta2=40 → K2=1e40.

Then, [Co(SCN)₂] + SCN^- → [Co(SCN)3] : beta3=63 → K3=1e63.

And [Co
