Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem in front of me. Let me try to figure it out step by step. The question is about identifying a compound based on its IR and NMR data, and then predicting the product when it reacts with red phosphorus and HI. Hmm, that sounds a bit tricky, but I'll take it slowly.

First, let me look at the given data. The IR shows peaks at 3400–2500 cm-1, which probably indicates the presence of an -OH group, maybe from a carboxylic acid since those have broad O-H stretches. There's also a peak at 1720 cm-1, which is a strong carbonyl (C=O) stretch. The 1610 and 1450 cm-1 regions might be from aromatic rings, possibly indicating substituents.

Looking at the NMR data next. The 1H NMR has a peak at 10.5 ppm, which is a broad singlet integrating for 1H. That's really high, so it must be an acidic proton, like a carboxylic acid -OH. Then there's a doublet at 8.0 ppm (2H) and another at 7.2 ppm (2H). That looks like a para-substituted aromatic ring—so maybe a benzene ring with two substituents opposite each other.

The 2.9 ppm multiplet (1H) suggests a CH group attached to something else, like a carbon adjacent to an oxygen. The 1.7 ppm multiplet (2H) could be a CH2 connected to another CH or maybe part of a chain. The 1.4 ppm doublet (3H) is a methyl group attached to something, maybe a CH2. And the 0.9 ppm triplet (3H) is likely a methyl at the end of an ethyl chain, like in CH2CH3.

Putting this together, the aromatic part is probably a para-substituted benzene. The substituents could be a methyl and a group that includes a carbonyl, considering the IR data. Wait, the IR has a strong carbonyl at 1720, which is typical for a ketone or a carboxylic acid. But the broad peak at 10.5 ppm suggests a carboxylic acid, not a ketone. So maybe the substituents are a methyl group and a propionoic acid group?

Wait, putting that together, the NMR shows two doublets in the aromatic region. Let me think about that. If the substituents are in para positions, the protons on the benzene would be two sets of doublets, each integrating to 2H. That fits with substituents in para positions.

So maybe the structure is a benzene ring with a methyl group and a propionoic acid group in para positions. Wait, but the NMR shows a CH group at 2.9 ppm. Let's see, if it's a propionoic acid, the structure would be CH2CH2COOH, but wait, that's not right. Wait, the carboxylic acid is -COOH, so the CHs would be adjacent. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the structure is 4-ethylbenzoic acid? Let's think. Benzoic acid has a COOH group attached to benzene. If it's 4-ethylbenzoic acid, then the ethyl group is at the para position. The NMR would then have the aromatic protons as two doublets. Let me see: the benzene would have substituents at para positions, so the protons adjacent to the COOH would be a doublet at around 8.0 ppm, and the ones adjacent to the ethyl would be a doublet around 7.2 ppm. That matches the NMR data.

But wait, the substituent on the benzene would be COOH and CH2CH2CH3? Or perhaps it's a COOH group and another substituent. Oh, wait, the other substituent might be a methyl group. No, wait, the NMR shows a triplet at 0.9 ppm, which is typical for a terminal methyl (like CH2CH3). So the other substituent could be an ethyl group attached to the benzene in the para position relative to the COOH.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let's try to sketch this out. The benzene ring has two substituents: one is the COOH group, and the other is an ethyl group? No, wait, the NMR shows a CH at 2.9 ppm. Let me think of the substituent structure.

If the substituent is not an ethyl but something else, perhaps a chain leading to a CH group. Wait, maybe it's a CH2COOH group attached to the benzene. No, that might not fit. Alternatively, maybe there's a propyl chain attached with a branch.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a CH2CH(CH3)2 group? No, that might complicate things. Alternatively, think about the NMR signals.

Looking at the NMR:

- 10.5 ppm: broad singlet, 1H. That's probably the -OH proton of a carboxylic acid.
- 8.0 ppm (d, 2H): aromatic protons, probably adjacent to the COOH group.
- 7.2 ppm (d, 2H): aromatic protons across from the COOH, perhaps adjacent to another substituent.
- 2.9 ppm (m, 1H): this could be a CH group attached to something, maybe adjacent to a carbonyl.
- 1.7 ppm (m, 2H): perhaps a CH2 next to a CH or a branching point.
- 1.4 ppm (d, 3H): a methyl group attached to something, maybe a CH2 that's part of a chain.
- 0.9 ppm (t, 3H): a terminal methyl, like in an ethyl chain
