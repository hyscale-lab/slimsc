Okay, so I have a chemistry problem here about titration, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me see what the question says.

Alright, the problem is: We dilute 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid with 20.00 cm³ of water, then titrate the resulting solution with 0.1 M NaOH at 25°C. We need to find the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point. The options are given, and the Ka is 1.85x10^-5.

Hmm, okay, I remember that when you dilute a solution, the concentration changes. So first, I should probably find the new concentration after dilution because the initial solution is being diluted with water.

So, the initial volume is 20.00 cm³ (which is 0.020 L) of 0.05 M acetic acid. When we add another 20.00 cm³ of water, the total volume becomes 40.00 cm³ (0.040 L). 

To find the new concentration, I can use the dilution formula: M1V1 = M2V2. M1 is 0.05 M, V1 is 0.020 L, V2 is 0.040 L. So M2 = (M1 * V1)/V2 = (0.05 * 0.020)/0.040. Let me calculate that: 0.001 / 0.040 is 0.025 M. So the diluted acetic acid is 0.025 M.

Next, when titrating with NaOH, which is a strong base, it will react with the acetic acid. The reaction is: CH3COOH + NaOH → CH3COO^- Na+ + H2O.

The equivalence point occurs when moles of NaOH added equals the moles of acetic acid initially present. Let me calculate the moles of acetic acid initially. Before dilution, moles = Molarity × Volume. So 0.05 M * 0.020 L = 0.001 moles. After dilution, the concentration is lower, but the same number of moles is present because we're just adding water. So moles of CH3COOH = 0.001 mol.

When titrated with 0.1 M NaOH, the volume needed at equivalence point is (moles of NaOH)/(Molarity of NaOH) = 0.001 mol / 0.1 M = 0.01 L = 10.00 cm³. Wait, but wait, the initial solution after dilution is 40 cm³. So the equivalence point is when we add 10 cm³ of NaOH, right?

But the question is about 25% titration and the equivalence point. So for 25% titration, how much NaOH do we add? 25% of 10 cm³ is 2.5 cm³. So we add 2.5 cm³ of 0.1 M NaOH.

Wait, no, actually, 25% of the equivalence point volume. So the equivalence point requires 10 cm³, so 25% is 2.5 cm³. So at 25% titration, 2.5 cm³ of NaOH is added.

But wait, perhaps I should think in terms of moles. At equivalence, moles NaOH = moles CH3COOH (0.001 mol). So 25% of that is 0.00025 mol of NaOH added.

So first, let's handle the 25% titration point:

At 25% titration, some of the acetic acid has been neutralized to form acetate ions. The reaction is 1:1, so moles reacted = 0.00025 mol. So the remaining acetic acid is 0.001 - 0.00025 = 0.00075 mol. And the moles of acetate formed is 0.00025 mol.

But wait, the total volume in the solution after adding NaOH. Let's see, initial diluted solution is 40 cm³. After adding 2.5 cm³ of NaOH, the total volume is 42.5 cm³ (0.0
