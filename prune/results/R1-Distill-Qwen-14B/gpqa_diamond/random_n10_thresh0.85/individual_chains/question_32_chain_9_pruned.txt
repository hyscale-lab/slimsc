Okay, so I have this physics problem to solve about the energy of the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC). Hmm, the question is asking for the energy when the speed of the nucleus X is 0.96c. X is defined as Lithium with 3 neutrons. Wait, Lithium normally has 3 protons, right? So if it has 3 neutrons, that makes it Li-6, I think.

First, I need to find the energy of the nucleus moving at 0.96 times the speed of light. I remember that in relativistic physics, the energy of a particle isn't just its rest mass energy. Oh right, the total energy includes the gamma factor.

Gamma is 1 over the square root of (1 minus v squared over c squared). So I should calculate gamma first. Let me write that down: γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²). Since v is 0.96c, let's compute that.

So plugging in v=0.96c: 1 - (0.96)^2 = 1 - 0.9216 = 0.0784. The square root of that is sqrt(0.0784) which is 0.28. So gamma is 1/0.28, which is approximately 3.5714. Let me double-check that calculation. Wait, 0.96 squared is indeed 0.9216. 1 - 0.9216 is 0.0784. The square root of 0.0784: Hmm, because 0.28 squared is 0.0784, yes. So gamma is 1/0.28 ≈ 3.5714.

But wait, maybe I should be more precise. Let me actually calculate it more accurately. Let's compute sqrt(0.0784):

Wait, 0.0784 = 784e-4. The square root of 784 is 28, so sqrt(0.0784) is 0.28 exactly. So gamma is 1/0.28 = 3.5714... approximately 3.57142857.

Now, I need the rest mass energy of the Li-6 nucleus. The atomic mass of Li-6 is about... Hmm, I think the mass number A is 6, since Li-6 has 3 protons and 3 neutrons. So the mass is approximately 6 atomic mass units (u).

Wait, but I should get the exact value. The atomic mass of a Li-6 nucleus. I remember that 1 u is about 931.5 MeV/c². So the rest mass energy is m*c² = 6 u * 931.5 MeV/u = 6 * 931.5 = 5589 MeV, which is 5.589 GeV.

So the total energy is gamma multiplied by the rest energy. So E = γ * m c² = 3.5714 * 5.589 GeV ≈ let's compute that.

Let me calculate 3.5714 * 5.589:

First, 3 * 5.589 = 16.767.

Then 0.5714 * 5.589: 0.5 *5.589=2.7945, 0.0714*5.589≈0.401. So total is 2.7945 +0.401=3.1955.

So adding to 16.767: 16.767 +3.1955=19.9625 GeV.

Wait, that can't be right because the options are around 20 or 21 GeV. Let me recalculate more accurately.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate 3.57142857 multiplied by 5.589.

Alternatively, let's compute it in steps.

3.57142857 = 25/7 approximately. Let me see: 25/7 is approximately 3.5714.

So 25/7 * 5.589 = (25 *5.589) /7.

25 *5.589 = 139.725.

139.725 /7 = approximately 19.9607 GeV.

Hm, but looking at the options, option C is 20.132 GeV, which is close. But why is there a discrepancy?

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation of gamma. Let me recheck:

Yes, v=0.96c, so beta (β) is 0.96. Then γ = 1/sqrt(1 - β²).

Let me compute 1 - β²: 1 - 0.96^2 = 1-0.9216=0.0784. So sqrt(0.0784)=0.28. So γ is 1/0.28=3.57142857.

Wait, perhaps the mass of Li-6 is not exactly 6 u? Let me think. The actual mass of a Li-6 atom is a bit less than 6 u because of binding energy. Wait, but does that matter? The question might assume the mass is 6 u. Alternatively, perhaps I should use the exact value of the mass.

Wait, I'm sorry, another thought. The mass of the nucleus isn't exactly 6 u. Because the mass of the nucleus is the sum of the masses of protons and neutrons minus the mass defect due to binding energy. But if the problem gives X as Li with 3 neutrons, then the nucleus is Li-6. Now, the exact mass of Li-6 in u can be found in tables.

Wait, perhaps the problem expects me to use the mass number (A=6) and treat it as approximately 6 u. Alternatively, perhaps the exact value is needed.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use the fact that the mass of a proton is about 1.007276 u and a neutron is about 1.008665 u. So for Li-6, which has 3 protons and 3 neutrons.

So calculating the mass:

3 * (1.007276) + 3 * (1.008665) = 3*(1.007276 +1.008665) = 3*(2.015941) = 6.047823 u.

Wait, but that's the total for 3 protons and 3 neutrons. But the actual mass of Li-6 is less because of the mass defect. So, the actual mass is about 6.017 u (I'm not certain, but I think Li-6 has a mass around 6.017 u).

Wait, perhaps I can double-check. The standard atomic weight of Li-6 is approximately 6.017 u. So using that, the rest mass energy would be 6.017 * 931.5 MeV.

Let me compute that: 6.017 * 931.5.

Calculating 6 *931.5 = 5589 MeV.

0.017 *931.5 = 15.8355 MeV.

So total is 5589 +15.8355 = 5604.8355 MeV, which is 5.6048355 GeV.

Now, the energy E is gamma multiplied by this rest energy.

Gamma is 3.57142857.

So 3.57142857 *5.6048355 GeV.

Let me compute this more accurately.

First, let's write it as 3.57142857 *5.6048355.

Compute 3 *5.6048355=16.8145065.

0.57142857 *5.6048355.

0.5 *5.6048355 =2.80241775.

0.07142857 *5.6048355 ≈ 0.4020893.

So adding those together: 2.80241775 +0.4020893 =3.20450705.

Adding to 16.8145065: 16.8145065 +3.20450705 =20.01901355 GeV.

Hmm, that's approximately 20.019 GeV.

Looking at the options: C is 20.132 GeV, which is a bit higher. But why is that?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the mass calculation. Let me double-check the mass of Li-6.

Wait, I think I should look up the exact value. The exact mass of a Li-6 nucleus is approximately 6.017 u. Let me confirm that. Alternatively, perhaps I should use the mass in terms of the atomic mass unit more accurately.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use more precise values for the protons and neutrons.

Wait, okay, the proton mass is approximately 1.007276 u, neutron is 1.008665 u.

So for Li-6, 3 protons and 3 neutrons:

3*(1.007276) = 3.021828 u.

3*(1.008665) =3.025995 u.

Total is 3.021828 +3.025995 =6.047823 u.

But the actual mass of Li-6 is about 6.017 u. Wait, that's a difference of about 0.0308 u. So the mass defect is about 0.0308 u, which is the binding energy.

So the actual mass is 6.017 u.

So using that, m c² is 6.017 u *9
