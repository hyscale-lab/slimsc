Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the answer step by step. Let's see what the question is.

The problem says that an unknown compound was prepared and characterized using FTIR, 1H NMR, and Mass Spectrometry. The goal is to identify the chemical formula from the given options: C6H12O2, C6H10O, C6H10O2, or C6H12O.

Hmm, let's start by breaking down each of the spectroscopic data given.

First, the FTIR spectrum. It shows a very broad absorption at 3000 cm⁻¹. Broad peaks around that region usually indicate O-H stretching. Like in alcohols or maybe carboxylic acids. But wait, the question also mentions two other strong peaks at 1700 and 1650 cm⁻¹. Oh, those might be carbonyl groups. The 1700 is probably a C=O stretch, like in a ketone or ester. The 1650 could be another carbonyl, maybe an aromatic ring with conjugation, or maybe an amide? Wait, but the options don't have nitrogen, so probably not amide. Alternatively, maybe an conjugated carbonyl, like in an alpha, beta-unsaturated carbonyl. Or perhaps it's an ester because esters have two carbonyls—wait, no, esters have one carbonyl. Wait, maybe a conjugated carbonyl, like in a ketone with an adjacent double bond.

Wait, wait. Let me think. 1700 is a typical carbonyl (like ketone, aldehyde, ester, etc.), while 1650 could be a conjugated carbonyl, like in a ketone with an adjacent double bond (like in a cyclic ketone with a double bond next to it). Or perhaps it's an aromatic ring with a carbonyl group attached, like in an aromatic ester or something like that.

Next, the NMR: several peaks, including vinyl hydrogens. Vinyl refers to CH₂=CH groups, so the compound has double bonds. So the structure likely has an alkene, maybe conjugated with a carbonyl. That's a possibility.

The mass spectrum shows a fragment at m/z=45. Let's think about possible fragments. 45 is a common mass. Let me recall: the molecular ion might break into a smaller fragment. For example, CH₃CO (which is 43, but close), or maybe something else. Alternatively, it could be a fragment like (CH₂)₂O (which is 44 not 45), or perhaps O=C-O (like the acetate group). Wait, the acetate group is CH3COO- but that's 60. Hmm.

Wait, another thought: 45 could be a (CH3)2CO+ ion? Let me calculate. (CH3)2CO is acetone. The molecular formula is C3H6O. The molecular weight is (3*12)+(6*1)+(16) = 36 +6 +16=58. But the fragment is 45, so maybe not. Alternatively, maybe the fragment is from a ketone. Let me think of possible fragments that
