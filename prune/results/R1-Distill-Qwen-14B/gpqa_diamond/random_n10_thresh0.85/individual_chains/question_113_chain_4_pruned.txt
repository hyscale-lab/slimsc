Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me read through the question again.

The question is about identifying an unknown compound using various spectroscopic techniques: FTIR, 1H NMR, and Mass Spectrometry. The options given are four different chemical formulas involving C, H, and O. I need to determine which one it is based on the spectral data provided.

Alright, let's break down each piece of information given.

First, the FTIR spectrum. It shows a very broad absorption peak at around 3000 cm⁻¹. Broad peaks in that region usually correspond to O-H stretches, like in alcohols or carboxylic acids. Wait, but wait, a very broad peak might suggest something else. Oh, right, if it's a broad peak around there, it's likely an O-H from an alcohol or maybe a carbonyl group, but no, the carbonyl absorptions are elsewhere. Wait, the other peaks are at 1700 and 1650 cm⁻¹. Those are in the range of carbonyl groups. 1700 is typical for a ketone or an aldehyde or maybe an ester. 1650 is a bit lower, which might be a conjugated carbonyl, like an ester or maybe a conjugated ketone, but I'm not too sure. Alternatively, it could be an aromatic ring with conjugated double bonds, but that's usually around 1600 or so. Hmm, maybe it's an ester since they have two carbonyl peaks sometimes if there's conjugation or different environments.

Next, the 1H NMR shows peaks corresponding to vinyl hydrogens. Vinyl hydrogens are the ones attached to double bonds, like in alkenes. So that suggests the compound has a double bond. Also, the other peaks—maybe some methyl or methylene groups.

The Mass Spectrometry (MS) shows a fragment peak at m/z = 45. I remember that 45 is a common fragment. Let me think: what has a mass of 45? I think CH3CO+ is 45 (since CH3 is 15 and CO is 30, but wait, 15+30 is 45). Oh, right, the fragment for acetic acid is 45. Alternatively, it could be an acetate ion. So if the compound has an ester group, like an acetyl group, that might produce a fragment of 45.

Now, putting this together. The presence of O-H (from the broad FTIR) and O-containing groups (from the carbonyl peaks) suggests maybe an ester or a ketone with an alcohol group. Wait, but if it's an ester, the structure is R-O-CO-R'. Esters have both an O and a carbonyl group, which would explain the IR peaks at 1700 and 1650. But wait, esters typically have a strong absorption around 1730-1750 for the carbonyl, but maybe conjugation can lower that. Alternatively, if it's a conjugated ester, like an alpha, beta-unsaturated ester, that might shift the carbonyl peak lower, around 1650 or so.

Wait, but then there's the O-H stretch. If the compound is an ester, maybe it's also an alcohol? No, that would be a glycol ester or something, which is less common. Alternatively, maybe it's a carboxylic acid. But a carboxylic acid would have a broad O-H peak due to the -COOH group, but the carbonyl peak would be around 1700, maybe higher. But in the FTIR, the peaks are at 1700 and 1650, which are lower than typical for a carboxylic acid. Hmm.

Wait, another thought. If the compound is a cyclic ester, like a lactone, that would have a carbonyl. But then, what about the O-H? Maybe the compound isn't an ester but a ketone with an alcohol group somewhere else. Let's think about the options given.

The options are:
A) C6H12O2
B) C6H10O
C) C6H10O2
D) C6H12O

The molecular formulas have different degrees of unsaturation. The degree of unsaturation is calculated as (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. Assuming no halogens or nitrogen, so (2C +2 - H)/2.

Let's compute each:

Option A: C6H12O2
Degrees of unsaturation = (2*6 +2 -12)/2 = (14-12)/2 = 2/2 =1. So 1 degree. That could be one ring or one double bond or one double bond and a ring, but wait, no, wait: each ring or double bond counts as one.

Wait, more accurately, each degree is a ring or a double bond. So 1 degree could be a single ring, or a single double bond, or a ring plus a double bond if more than one.

Option B: C6H10O
Degrees: (2*6 +2 -10)/2 = (14-10)/2=4/2=2. So two degrees—maybe a ring and a double bond, or two double bonds, or two rings.

Option C: C6H10O2
Degrees: (2*6 +2 -10)/2= (14-10)/2=2.

Option D: C6H12O
Degrees: (2*6 +2 -12)/2= (14-12)/2=2/2=1.

So options A and D have 1 degree, B and C have 2.

The NMR shows vinyl hydrogens, which are from a double bond. So that's a double bond, that's one degree of unsaturation. So the compound must have at least one double bond. So the options with 2 degrees would have either another double bond or a ring, or a triple bond. But triple bonds are less common in these compounds.

So, if we have a double bond (one degree), the remaining degree can be a ring or another double bond. Let's think.

Looking back at the IR: the carbonyl peaks at 1700 and 1650 cm^-1. That's two peaks, which probably suggests two different carbonyl groups or some conjugated system. Alternatively, it could be an aromatic ring with conjugated carbonyl groups, but that would be in the 1600s usually.

Wait, another possibility is an enol group. Enols have conjugated carbonyl and double bonds. But I'm not sure.

The mass spec peak at 45 suggests CH3CO+ or similar. If the compound has an acetyl group (like an ester with an acetyl), that would fit. So if the compound is an ester with an acetyl group, then the formula would have an O from the ester.

Wait, but let's think about the options. Let's look at each option and see which fits.

Option A: C6H12O2. That could be something like methyl cyclohexanoate (if it's an ester) but I'm not sure. Alternatively, if it's a diol, but that doesn't fit with the IR.

Option B: C6H10O. That's like cyclohexene with an alcohol group, perhaps? But that would have O-H in IR, but what about the carbonyl? So that might not explain the peaks at 1700 and 1650. Unless it's a ketone and an alcohol, but that would be O in the formula as O2, but option B has only one O. So maybe not.

Option C: C6H10O2. That's two oxygen atoms. Possible structures: esters, ketones with an alcohol, but more likely an ester. For example, an ester would have O2.

Option D: C6H12O. One O. So perhaps an alcohol and a ketone? But that would require two O's, so that's conflicting. So option D can't be right because the IR has two carbonyl peaks, which would require two O-containing groups.

Wait, but wait. If the compound has both a ketone and an alcohol, that would require two oxygen atoms in the formula. But option D has only one O. So that can't be. So options B and D can be eliminated on that basis.

So now we're down to options A and C.

Option A: C6H12O2. Degrees of unsaturation = 1. So either a ring or a double bond. But in our case, the NMR shows vinyl hydrogens, so a double bond is present. So option A would have one double bond and perhaps a ring? Wait, no, because the degrees of unsaturation is 1, so it's either a double bond or a ring. But the presence of a double bond would account for that 1 degree, so it's a double bond only. So the structure would have a double bond and an ester group? Or maybe a ring and an ester?

Wait, but if the structure is an ester, which has a carbonyl group, and also a double bond, perhaps as part of an alpha,beta-unsaturated ester. That would explain the two carbonyl peaks? Maybe not, but let's think.

Option C: C6H10O2. Degrees of unsaturation: 2. So that could be a double bond and a ring, or two double bonds, or a triple bond. But the presence of a double bond (vinyl H) plus another double bond or a ring.

Looking back at the IR: the two carbonyl peaks. So perhaps two carbonyl groups. But wait, an ester only has one carbonyl. So if the compound has two carbonyls, that would require two oxygenated groups, like a ketone and an ester, but that might complicate the structure.

Alternatively, maybe the compound is a cyclic ester (lactone), which would have a carbonyl. Or perhaps it's a diester, but I don't think so given the formula.

Wait, another possibility: the compound could have a conjugated carbonyl. For example, an alpha,beta-unsaturated ketone. That might show two IR peaks because of the conjugation. So the carbonyl would be around 1700 and the conjugated double bond around 1650. Wait, but in that case, the NMR would show vinyl protons, which is what the question states.

So if the compound is an alpha,beta-unsaturated ketone, then the structure would have a ketone (C=O) and a double bond (C=C), which accounts for the two carbonyl peaks. But wait, the
