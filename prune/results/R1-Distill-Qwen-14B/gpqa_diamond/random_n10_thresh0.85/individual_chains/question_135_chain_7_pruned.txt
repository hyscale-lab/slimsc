Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about particle decays. Let's see what it's about. Hmm, the question is about the possible decay channels of a boson X with a mass of 6 GeV. The interaction Lagrangian is given, but I'm a bit rusty on my particle physics, so I'll need to think this through step by step.

Alright, the Lagrangian is L = -λ f f-bar ψ_f (ῡ + X) ψ_f. Wait, maybe I misread it. Oh, right, it's probably something like L = -λ f ψ_f (ῡ + X) ψ_f-bar? Because the structure seems like it's a Yukawa coupling term. So, the boson X couples to fermions, and the coupling is proportional to λ times the product of the fermion fields and the boson field.

The first thing I need to figure out is which fermions can X decay into. The boson X has a mass of 6 GeV, so any decay products must have a combined mass less than 6 GeV for it to be kinematically allowed. 

Wait, no, more accurately, for a particle to decay into two particles, the mass of the parent must be greater than the sum of the rest masses of the two daughters. So, for X → f f-bar, the mass of X must be greater than 2 m_f, where m_f is the mass of the fermion f.

So I need to list all the possible fermions f such that 2 m_f < 6 GeV. Let's list all the known fermions and their masses.

Fermions include quarks, leptons, etc. Let me think about their masses:

- Up quark (u): ~2 MeV (current quark mass)
- Down quark (d): ~4-5 MeV
- Strange quark (s): ~95-100 MeV
- Charm quark (c): ~1.5 GeV
- Bottom quark (b): ~4.5 GeV
- Top quark (t): way too heavy, around 173 GeV. So 2m_t is 346 GeV, which is way more than 6 GeV. So X can't decay into t t-bar.

Leptons:
- Electron (e): ~0.5 MeV
- Muon (mu): ~105.7 MeV
- Tau (tau): ~1.78 GeV
- Neutrinos: their masses are negligible compared to GeV scales.

Wait, but when considering fermion pairs, like f and anti-f, the mass of each is the same, so I have to double the mass.

So for each fermion f, check if 2m_f < 6 GeV.

Let's go through each possible f:

1. Up quark (u): 2*2 MeV = 4 MeV <6 GeV → allowed.
2. Down quark (d): 2*5 MeV =10 MeV → way less than 6 GeV. Allowed.
3. Strange quark (s): 2*100 MeV = 200 MeV → 0.2 GeV <6 GeV. Allowed.
4. Charm quark (c): 2*1.5 GeV =3 GeV <6 GeV → allowed.
5. Bottom quark (b): 2*4.5 GeV =9 GeV >6 GeV → Not allowed. So X can't decay into b b-bar.
6. Top quark: as above, way too heavy.

Leptons:

1. Electron (e): 2*0.5 MeV =1 MeV → allowed.
2. Muon (mu): 2*105.7 MeV = 211.4 MeV → 0.21 GeV <6 GeV → allowed.
3. Tau (tau): 2*1.78 GeV ≈ 3.56 GeV <6 GeV → allowed. But wait, tau is a much heavier lepton, but still 3.56 <6, so allowed.
4. Neutrinos: negligible mass, so 2m~0, so allowed.

Wait, but wait a second. For X to decay into a fermion-antifermion pair, the coupling must exist. The given interaction Lagrangian is important here. The Lagrangian is L = -λ f ψ_f (ῡ + X) ψ_f-bar? Or maybe I should parse it correctly.

Wait, the problem says the interaction is given by L(y) = -λ f f-bar(y) (ῡ + X(y)) ψ_f(y). Wait, maybe that's not the correct way to parse. Alternatively, perhaps it's written as L = -λ f \bar{ψ}_f (ῡ + X) ψ_f. Wait, that doesn't seem right because ψ_f is on both sides. Maybe it's supposed to be L = -λ f \bar{ψ}_f (ῡ + X) ψ_{f} ?

Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me think again. The structure usually is something like L = g ψ ψ X, meaning X couples to two fermions. So the correct Lagrangian for a Yukawa coupling is something like L = -g \bar{ψ} ψ X, which would imply that X can decay into a pair of fermions ψ.

So in this problem, the Lagrangian is written as L = -λ f \bar{ψ}_f (ῡ + X) ψ_f. Wait, that seems a bit odd. Perhaps it's a typo or I'm misreading it. Alternatively, maybe f and ψ_f are different? Like maybe it's f is the fermion field, and ψ_f is another? That seems unlikely. Alternatively, perhaps the correct interaction is L = -λ \bar{ψ}_f (ῡ + X) ψ_f. Because that would make sense, where X couples to ψ_f and ψ_f-bar.

Wait, but the way it's written is L(y) = -λ f \bar{ψ}_f (ῡ + X) ψ_f(y). Hmm, perhaps it's supposed to mean that X couples to ψ_f and maybe another field? Not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the ψ_f is a typo and it should be ψ, another fermion.

Wait, perhaps the ψ_f is a typo, and it's supposed to be ψ. Let me assume that the interaction Lagrangian is L = -λ \bar{ψ} ψ X, which is a Yukawa coupling term. So X couples to all fermions ψ. But wait, the notation is a bit confusing. Alternatively, perhaps f is a scalar field, but that's not the case here.

Alternatively, perhaps the interaction is such that X couples to all fermions, so any fermion can be produced via X. Then, the decay would be allowed for any fermion f where 2m_f < m_X.

But the X here has a mass of 6 GeV. So the possible fermion pairs are those with 2m_f <6 GeV.

So for each fermion, check if 2m_f <6 GeV.

Let me list all possible fermions:

- Quarks: u, d, s, c, b, t.

But since top quark is too heavy (2m_t >6 GeV), it's out. Similarly, bottom quark: 2m_b =9 GeV >6 GeV, so it's out.

So the allowed quarks are u, d, s, c.

Wait, wait, let's see:

u: 2*2 MeV → 4 MeV → 0.004 GeV <<6 GeV → allowed.

d: 2*5 MeV → 10 MeV → 0.01 GeV → allowed.

s: 2*100 MeV → 200 MeV → 0.2 GeV → allowed.

c: 2*1.5 GeV → 3 GeV → allowed.

b: 2*4.5=9 GeV → not allowed.

t: way too heavy.

Leptons:

e: 2*0.5 MeV → 1 MeV → allowed.

mu: 2*105.7 MeV → ~210 MeV → 0.21 GeV → allowed.

tau: 2*1.78 GeV → ~3.56 GeV → allowed.

So, the fermions that X can decay into are u, d, s, c, e, mu, tau.

Wait, but wait. The options given are about which decay channels are present. So, each decay would be X → f f-bar, where f is any of the allowed fermions.

But wait, looking at the options:

Option A: X → b b-bar, s s-bar, u
