Okay, I've got this organic chemistry problem here. Let's see what I can do. So, the question is about identifying a product formed when compound X reacts with red phosphorus and HI. The options are A to D. 

First, I'll look at the spectroscopic data provided. The IR and NMR data should help me figure out what compound X is.

Starting with the IR data: 3400–2500 cm-1. That's a broad region, probably an O-H stretch. So maybe there's a carboxylic acid or an alcohol group. But wait, the other IR peaks are 1720 cm-1, which is around the range for a carbonyl group, like a ketone or a carboxylic acid. Then 1610 and 1450 cm-1 – those could be aromatic C=C stretches. 

Looking at the 1H NMR data. Let's parse that out. 

The peaks are:
- 10.5 ppm (bs, 1H): Broad singlet. Maybe an O-H proton, like from a carboxylic acid. That would fit with the 1720 cm-1 IR peak being a carbonyl.
- 8.0 ppm (d, 2H): Aromatic protons, probably para-substituted since it's a doublet.
- 7.2 ppm (d, 2H): Another set of aromatic protons, again a doublet, suggesting para substitution.
- 2.9 ppm (m, 1H): Maybe a CH group next to something electronegative, like a carbonyl.
- 1.7 ppm (m, 2H): Two protons, perhaps adjacent to a CH group.
- 1.4 ppm (d, 3H): A triplet of three protons, maybe a CH(CH3) group? Or perhaps a geminal group.
- 0.9 ppm (t, 3H): A terminal CH3, like at the end of a chain, maybe a methyl group attached to something more substituted.

Putting this together, the aromatic region suggests a para-substituted benzene ring. The downfield proton at 10.5 ppm suggests a carboxylic acid group attached to the ring. So the structure is likely benzoic acid with some substituents.

Wait, but looking at the substituents. The CH at 2.9 ppm and the adjacent CH2 at 1.7 ppm. Let me think. If we have a carbonyl group (like a carboxylic acid), then maybe the CH is adjacent to it. So, perhaps a structure like Ar-CH2-COOH? But wait, in benzoic acid derivatives, substituents are usually directly attached.

Alternatively, the aromatic ring has a substituent like a -CH2CH2CH(CH3)2? Hmm, not sure. Let me think about the NMR signals.

The 2.9 ppm multiplet (1H) could be a methylene adjacent to a carbonyl. Wait, no, that's just one H. Alternatively, maybe it's a CH group next to another CH2. Let's consider a propyl chain attached to the ring.

Wait, maybe the structure is something like a benzene ring with a side chain. Let me imagine the substituents. The aromatic ring is para-substituted. So, maybe the substituent is a propionyl group? Or perhaps a substituent that leads to a butyl group after some reaction.

Wait, another approach. The IR has a carbonyl (1720 cm-1). The broad peak around 10.5 ppm is likely a carboxylic acid (since alcohols would usually be less downfield, around 1-5 ppm). So compound X is a benzoic acid derivative. 

So the structure is probably a substituted benzoic acid. The aromatic protons are in a para-substituted pattern. So, the substituent is at the para position, and perhaps the benzoic acid is in another position. Wait, but in a benzoic acid, the COOH is at one position, and substituents can be elsewhere. But the NMR shows that the aromatic protons are two doublets, each integrating to 2H. That suggests the substituents are at the para positions, so the ring has two substituents: one COOH and another group which is an ethyl or something else.

Wait, but in the NMR, the aromatic protons are each a doublet. That would happen if each set is adjacent to a substituent. For example, if the ring has two substituents in para positions, then the protons adjacent to each substituent would be a doublet.

Wait, but let me think. If the ring has a COOH group at position 1 and another substituent at position 4, then the H at position 2 and 6 would be adjacent to COOH, and the H at position 3 and 5 would be adjacent to the other substituent. So each of these would be doublets, giving two sets of doublets. That fits with the NMR: 8.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.2 ppm (d, 2H). So, the substituents are at 1 and 4 positions, which makes sense for a para-substituted benzoic acid.

So, the substituent at position 4 would be something else. Let's look at the other NMR signals. The 1.4 ppm (d, 3H) could be a methyl group attached to a CH2, which is attached to a CH. The 1.7 ppm (m, 2H) could be the CH2 adjacent to the CH. The 2.9 ppm (m, 1H) is the CH. The 0.9 ppm (t, 3H) is likely a methyl group at the end of a chain. 

Putting this together, perhaps the substituent is a -CH2CH(CH2CH3) group? Or maybe a -CH2CH2CH(CH3)2? Wait, not sure. Alternatively, perhaps it's a -CH2CH2CH2CH3 group, but that would make the CH2 adjacent to the ring have more protons, but the signals here don't add up. Hmm.

Wait, another angle. Let's think about the structure of compound X. The substituent is at position 4 of the benzoic acid. The NMR suggests a chain attached to the ring. The 1.4 ppm is a d (doublet), 3H. A doublet at 1.4 ppm with 3H is likely a methyl group attached to a CH, which is perhaps adjacent to another CH2. 

So maybe the substituent is a group like -CH2CH(CH3)2? Because that would give a CH(CH3)2, but wait, the NMR shows a triplet at 0.9 ppm (3H), which suggests a CH2CH3 at the end. Let me think: perhaps the substituent is a -CH2CH2CH(CH3)2 group? No, that might not fit. Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a -CH2CH2CH2CH3, but that would be a propyl group, but the NMR shows a CH(CH3) group.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a -CH2CH(CH2CH3) group. Let me try to reconstruct:

The substituent is a CH2 group attached to the ring. Then next, a CH which is connected to a CH2 (maybe) and a CH3. Let me see:

Looking at the NMR:
- 0.9 ppm (t, 3H): a terminal CH3, maybe from a -CH
