Okay, so I've got this question about a diatomic molecule and the quantum rotation-vibration model. Hmm. Let me try to think through this step by step.

The question says that the molecule is in its fundamental state, which I think means it's in the lowest energy state. Now, it's absorbing a photon, and we need to find the momentum of that photon such that the molecule moves to the next state with the lowest possible energy.

Wait, the model is the quantum rotation-vibration model, which I remember combines both rotational and vibrational energy states. So, the molecule's energy isn't just about rotation or vibration but a combination of both.

So, the fundamental state is the lowest energy state. When it absorbs a photon, it goes to the next state. But what does 'next state' mean here? I think it could be either the next rotational state, the next vibrational state, or a combination. But the question says the 'lowest possible energy', so I'm guessing it's the next higher energy state overall, which would probably be the first excited state.

Wait, but in the quantum models, each state is quantized. For the rigid rotor model, the rotational energy levels are quantized as E_rot = B J (J+1), where B is the rotational constant, and J is the rotational quantum number. For the vibrational part, the energy levels are quantized as E_vib = (n + 1/2) h w, where n is the vibrational quantum number.

But wait, this is the non-rigid rotor model, which I think is more accurate because the bond length isn't perfectly rigid. But maybe for this problem, it's treated as a rigid rotor? Or maybe it's the rotation-vibration coupling, but perhaps the problem is just considering the energy transition from the ground state.

Wait, the question is about switching to the next state with the lowest possible energy. So the molecule is initially in the lowest energy state, which is the ground state, with J=0 and n=0. So, when it absorbs a photon, it can either increase J or n.

The next lowest energy after the ground state would be either the first rotational state (J=1, n=0) or the first vibrational state (J=0, n=1). But which transition requires a lower energy photon? Because the energy of the photon must match the energy difference between the states.

So, let's compute the energy differences for both possibilities.

First, let's find the rotational constant B. The rotational constant is given by B = (ħ²)/(2I), where I is the moment of inertia. I for a diatomic molecule is μ r², where μ is the reduced mass and r is the bond length.

So, μ is (Mx * My)/(Mx + My). Let me calculate that. Mx is 20 amu, My is 2 amu. So μ = (20 *2)/(20+2) = 40/22 = 20/11 ≈ 1.818 amu. Wait, but I need to convert that into kg because the standard units are in SI.

1 amu is approximately 1.66053906660e-27 kg. So μ = 20/11 * 1.6605e-27 kg. Let me compute that. 20/11 is about 1.818, so 1.818 * 1.6605e-27 ≈ 2.999e-27 kg? Wait, let me do that more accurately.

20/11 = 1.8181818... So 1.81818 * 1.6605e-27 kg is approximately (1.81818 * 1.6605) = approx 3.012e-27 kg. Wait, but wait. Let's compute it more precisely.

1.81818 * 1.6605 = Let's see. 1.81818 * 1.6 = 2.909, 1.81818 * 0.0605= appx 0.110. So total about 3.019. So 3.019e-27 kg.

Wait, but more accurately, 1.81818 * 1.6605 = let's compute: 1.6605 * 1.8. That's 2.9889. 1.6605 * 0.01818 is approximately 0.03008. So total is 3.01898e-27 kg. So μ ≈ 3.01898e-27 kg.

The bond length R is 2 angstroms. 1 angstrom is 1e-10 meters, so R = 2e-10 m.

Moment of inertia I = μ R² = (3.01898e-27 kg) * (2e-10 m)^2. Let's compute that.

(2e-10)^2 is 4e-20. So I = 3.01898e-27 * 4e-20 = 1.20759e-46 kg m².

Now, the rotational constant B is ħ²/(2I). Planck's constant ħ is approximately 1.0545718e-34 J s.

So, ħ squared is (1.05457e-34)^2 ≈ 1.112e-68 (J s)^2.

Then, B = (1.112e-68) / (2 * 1.20759e-46) = let's compute the denominator first: 2*1.20759e-46 is 2.41518e-46.

So B = 1.112e-68 / 2.41518e-46 = approximately 4.605e-23 J.

Wait, let me compute that more accurately.

1.112e-68 / 2.41518e-46 = (1.112 / 2.41518) ) * 1e-22.

1.112 / 2.41518 ≈ 0.46. So approximately 0.46e-22 J. So B ≈ 4.6e-23 J.

Wait, alternatively, perhaps I should double-check the calculation. Let's compute 1.05457e-34 squared. Hmm. Let's compute 1.05457e-34 squared.

(1.05457)^2 = approx 1.112 (as I had). So yes, correct.

So B = ( (1.05457e-34)^2 ) / (2 * 3.01898e-27 kg * (2e-10 m)^2 ) )

Wait, perhaps I should re-calculate B correctly.

Wait, moment of inertia I is μ R².

So I = μ R² = ( (20 * 2)/(20+2) ) * 1e-27 kg * (2e-10)^2.

Wait, no. Wait, wait. The reduced mass μ is (Mx * My) / (Mx + My) all in kg.

So Mx = 20 amu = 20 * 1.6605e-27 kg = 3.321e-26 kg.

My = 2 amu = 3.321e-27 kg.

So μ = (3.321e-26 kg * 3.321e-27 kg) / (3.321e-26 + 3.321e-27) kg.

Wait, no. Wait, Mx is 20 amu, My is 2 amu. So Mx is 20 *1.6605e-27 kg = 3.321e-26 kg.

My is 2 *1.6605e-27 kg = 3.321e-27 kg.

So μ = (3.321e-26 * 3.321e-27 ) / (3.321e-26 + 3.321e-27 )

Compute numerator: 3.321e-26 * 3.321e-27 = approx (3.321)^2 * 1e-53 ≈ 11.025 * 1e-53 = 1.1025e-52 kg².

Denominator: 3.321e-26 + 3.321e-27 = 3.321e-26 (1 + 0.1) ) = 3.321e-26 * 1.1 ≈ 3.6531e-26 kg.

So μ = 1.1025e-52 / 3.6531e-26 = approximately 3.018e-27 kg.

Which matches what I had earlier.

So I = μ R² = (3.018e-27 kg) * (2e-10 m)^2 = 3.018e-27 *4e-20 = 1.207e-46 kg m².

Then, B = ħ²/(2I) = (1.05457e-34)^2/(2 * 1.207e-46 )

Compute numerator: (1.05457e-34)^2 = approx 1.112e-68 (as before).

Denominator: 2 * 1.207e-46 = 2.414e-46.

So B = 1.112e-68 / 2.414e-46 = 4.605e-23 J.

Wait, 1.112e-68 / 2.414e-46 = (1.112 / 2.414 ) * 1e-22.

1.112 /2.414 is approximately 0.46, so 0.46e-22 = 4.6e-23 J.

So B is 4.6e-23 J.

Now, the rotational energy levels are E_rot = B J (J +1 ), where J is 0,1,2,...

The vibrational energy levels are E_vib = (n + 1/2) h w.

h is Planck's constant, about 6.626e-34 J s.

The angular frequency w is given as 4e14 rad/s.

So the vibrational energy difference between n=0 and n=1 is h w.

h*w = 6.626e-34 *4e14 = 6.626e-34 *4e14 = 2.6504e-19 J.

So the vibrational energy difference is about 2.65e-19 J.

The rotational energy difference from J=0 to J=1 is E_rot (J=1) - E_rot(J=0) = B [1(2)] - 0 = 2B = 2*4.6e-23 = 9.2e-23 J.

So the photon needs to have energy equal to either the vibrational transition (2.65e-19 J) or the rotational transition (9.2e-23 J). Which one is smaller? Well, 9.2e-23 is way smaller than 2.65e-19.

But wait, the question is about the next state with the lowest possible energy. So the molecule is initially in the ground state (J=0, n=0). The next state would be the one requiring the least energy. So the photon should match the energy of the lowest possible transition.

Wait, but in the rigid rotor, when you excite J from 0 to 1, that's a ΔE of 2B. But since the rotational energy is much lower than the vibrational, the transition would be to J=1, n=0.

Alternatively, the vibrational transition requires more energy. So the photon needed for the rotational transition has lower energy. So the molecule would absorb the photon with energy 2B (9.2e-23 J), which is much lower than the vibrational transition.

Wait, but wait. So the question is, what is the momentum of the photon that allows the molecule to switch to the next state with the lowest possible energy. So the photon's energy should be the minimum possible, which is the rotational transition.

So the energy of the photon is 2B = 9.2e-23 J.

But wait, no. Let's think again. The molecule is in the fundamental state, which is the lowest energy state. So when it absorbs a photon, it can go to the next higher state, which is the first excited state. So the first excited state could be J=1, n=0 or J=0, n=1. Which has lower energy?

Let me calculate which one is lower.

E_rot (J=1) = B*(1)(2) = 2B = 9.2e-23 J.

E_vib (n=1) = h w = 2.65e-19 J.

2B is way smaller than h w. So the first excited state is the rotational one.

So the photon must have energy equal to 2B, which is 9.2e-23 J.

Now, the question is about the momentum of the photon. The photon's energy is related to its momentum. The energy of a photon is E = p c, where p is momentum and c is speed of light.

Wait, no. E = p c. So p = E / c.

So c is approximately 3e8 m/s.

So, p = 9.2e-23 J / (3e8 m/s) = 3.066e-31 kg m/s.

Wait, let me compute that.

9.2e-23 / 3e8 = (9.2 /3 )e-31 = approximately 3.066e-31 kg m/s.

Wait, but looking at the options, the options are much larger than this. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the approach. Let me double-check.

Wait, another possibility is that the molecule is in a vibrational state, and the photon is absorbed in a vibrational transition, perhaps from the ground vibrational state to the first excited. But why would the rotational transition have a lower energy? Because 2B is much smaller than h w.

Wait, but wait, perhaps the question is considering the combination of both rotational and vibrational states. But the next state with the lowest energy would be the one where the energy increment is minimal. So the rotational transition is lower.

Wait, but the given options don't match the calculated p of 3e-31 kg m/s. Let me check the options again.

Options:
A) 1.9e-28 Ns
B) 2.3e-27 Ns
C) 1.1e-27 Ns
D) 1.4e-28 Ns

Wait, 1 Ns is 1 kg m/s. So let's see, 3e-31 kg m/s = 3e-31 Ns. But none of the options are near that.

Hmm. So either I made a mistake in the approach, or perhaps the question is considering the vibrational transition.

Wait, perhaps I confused rotational and vibrational contributions. Let me think again.

Wait, the problem is about the quantum rotation-vibration model, which includes both rotational and vibrational energy. So perhaps the transitions can involve changes in both J and n.

But the question says it's the next state with the lowest possible energy. So perhaps the molecule can go to a state where either J increases or n increases, and we need the transition with the smallest energy.

So the energy difference between the ground state (n=0, J=0) and the next state could be either a rotational (J=1, n=0) or a vibrational (n=1, J=0), or a combination like (n=0, J=1) or (n=1, J=0).

Which of these has the lowest energy increment? The rotational transition has a smaller ΔE (2B) compared to the vibrational (h w). So the photon's energy should be 2B.

So the photon's momentum is E/c = (2B)/c.

Wait, but earlier calculation gives p = 3e-31 kg m/s, which is 3e-31 Ns. But none of the options are that small.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation of B. Let me recompute B.

Wait, let's go back:

B = ħ²/(2I)

I = μ r².

μ is (20 * 2 )/(20 +2 ) = 40/22 = 20/11 ≈ 1.818 amu.

So 1 amu = 1.6605e-27 kg.

So μ = (20/11) * 1.6605e-27 kg.

So let's compute that: 20/11 is approximately 1.81818.

1.81818 * 1.6605e-27 ≈ Let's compute 1.81818 *1.6605.

1.81818 *1.6 = 2.9091.

1.81818 *0.0605 = 0.11005.

Adding them gives approximately 3.01915e-27 kg.

So μ ≈ 3.01915e-27 kg.

R is 2 angstroms = 2e-10 m.

I = μ * R^2 =3.01915e-27 kg * (2e-10 m)^2.

(2e-10)^2 is 4e-20 m².

So I =3.01915e-27 * 4e-20 = (3.01915 *4 )e-47 = 12.0766e-47 = 1.20766e-46 kg m².

Now, ħ is 1.0545718e-34 J s.

So ħ squared is (1.0545718e-34)^2 = about 1.112e-68 (J s)^2.

So B = (1.112e-68) / (2 * 1.20766e-46) ) = 1.112e-68 / 2.4153e-46.

Compute denominator: 2 * 1.20766e-46 = 2.4153e-46.

So B = 1.112e-68 / 2.4153e-46 = (1.112 / 2.4153) ) * 1e-22.

1.112 / 2.4153 ≈ 0.46.

So B ≈ 0.46e-22 J = 4.6e-23 J.

So the rotational energy difference is 2B =9.2e-23 J.

So the photon's energy is 9.2e-23 J.

Photon's momentum p = E / c = 9.2e-23 J / 3e8 m/s.

So p = (9.2e-23) / (3e8) = 3.066e-31 kg m/s = 3.066e-31 N s.

Wait, looking at the options, all are around 1e-27 to 2e-27 N s, which is three orders of magnitude larger than what I got. So I must have made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps I mixed up the model. Let me think. Oh wait! The model is the non-rigid rotor model, which includes vibrational energy as well. So maybe the energy levels are a combination of both. So perhaps the transition is not just pure rotational or pure vibrational, but a change in both. So in the non-rigid model, the energy levels are given by:

E(J, n) = B J (J+1) + (n + 1/2) h w.

So the fundamental state is (J=0, n=0). The next state with the lowest energy would be the one where either J increases or n increases, whichever requires less energy.

So compute the energy to go from (0,0) to (1,0): ΔE_rot = 2B.

Or from (0,0) to (0,1): ΔE_vib = h w.

Which is smaller? 2B is 9.2e-23 J, and h w is 2.65e-19 J. So 2B is smaller. So the photon's energy is 9.2e-23 J.

But why are the answer options so much larger? Hmm.

Wait a second, perhaps I made a mistake in units. Let me double-check the calculation for B.

Wait, I think I might have made a mistake in the calculation of I. Let me re-calculate I.

I = μ R².

μ is (20 * 2 )/(20 +2 ) = 40/22 = 20/11 ≈ 1.818 amu.

Wait, but 1 amu is 1.6605e-27 kg.

So μ = (20 * 2 )/(22 ) * 1.6605e-27 kg.

Wait, wait, no. The formula is μ = (Mx * My) / (Mx + My) ) * (1.6605e-27 kg).

So Mx =20 amu =20 *1.6605e-27 kg.

My=2 amu =2*1.6605e-27 kg.

So μ = (20 * 1.6605e-27 * 2 * 1.6605e-27 ) / (20 +2 ) ) ?

Wait, no. The formula is μ = ( Mx * My ) / ( Mx + My ) ) * (1 amu in kg).

So Mx is 20 amu, My is 2 amu.

So μ = (20 * 2 )/(20 +2 ) ) * (1.6605e-27 kg).

So 40/22 = 20/11 ≈1.81818.

So μ = 1.81818 * 1.6605e-27 kg.

1.81818 *1.6605e-27 = let's compute:

1.8 *1.6605e-27 = 2.989e-27 kg.

0.01818 *1.6605e-27 = approx 2.998e-29 kg.

So total is approx 2.989e-27 + 0.02998e-27 = 3.018e-27 kg.

So I = μ R² =3.018e-27 kg * (2e-10 m)^2.

(2e-10)^2 =4e-20 m².

So I =3.018e-27 *4e-20 = 12.07e-47 kg m² =1.207e-46 kg m².

So I is correct.

Then B = ħ²/(2I) = (1.05457e-34)^2 / (2 *1.207e-46 )

Compute numerator: 1.05457^2 = approx 1.112. So 1.112e-68.

Denominator: 2 *1.207e-46 =2.414e-46.

So B=1.112e-68 / 2.414e-46 = 4.6e-23 J.

Hmm. So E_rot=2B=9.2e-23 J.

Photon energy = 9.2e-23 J.

p = E/c =9.2e-23 /3e8 =3.066e-31 kg m/s = 3.066e-31 N s.

But none of the options match this.

Wait, looking at the options again:

A) 1.9e-28 Ns

B) 2.3e-27 Ns

C) 1.1e-27 Ns

D) 1.4e-28 Ns

Hmm. So perhaps I made a mistake in the approach. Maybe the question is considering the vibration-rotation coupling, but perhaps the transition is to the next state which increases both J and n. But that seems unlikely because that would require more energy.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering the simultaneous excitation in both modes, but the energy would be higher, so not the minimal.

Wait another thought: perhaps in the rotation-vibration model, the energy levels are such that the vibrational state can only change when the rotational state changes. Or perhaps the question is considering a transition where both J and n increase, but that would require more energy than either alone.

Wait, perhaps I've made a mistake in the model. Let me think: in the non-rigid rotor model, the bond length isn't fixed, so the moment of inertia is a function of the vibrational state. But perhaps the energy levels are given by a combination of both.

But perhaps for the purpose of this question, the problem is simplifying it to either a rotational or vibrational transition.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule's transition is a combination of both, but the energy is the sum. Or perhaps the question is actually about the vibrational transition.

Wait, but the energy for the vibrational transition is much higher than the rotational. So if the question is about the lowest possible energy, the rotational transition is the correct one.

Hmm. So perhaps I have miscalculated the energy of the photon.

Wait, what if the question is considering the rotational transition, but the calculation yields a different value.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of B. Let me recompute B.

Wait, perhaps I missed a factor.

Wait, another approach. Let me compute the rotational energy levels for J=0 and J=1.

E(J) = B J (J+1).

For J=0: E=0.

For J=1: E=2B.

So the energy difference is 2B.

So photon's energy must be 2B.

So E_photon =2B.

Now, B = ħ^2/(2I) = ( (h/(2pi) )^2 )/(2 I )

Alternatively, B = h²/(8 pi² I ) * (1/(2I) ? No, wait.

Wait, the formula for B is correct as I used before.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the rotational energy difference in terms of w. Wait, no, because w is given for vibration.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the rotational energy in terms of the rotational frequency, but I don't have that. Alternatively, perhaps the question is expecting to use the vibrational w in some way. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is asking about the photon's momentum, which is p = E/c.

Wait, 9.2e-23 J /3e8 m/s = 3.066e-31 kg m/s = 3.066e-31 Ns.

Looking at the options again, the smallest option is A)1.9e-28 Ns, which is about 60,000 times larger than my calculated value.

Hmm. So where is the mistake?

Wait, another thought: perhaps the question is considering the transition from the fundamental state (v=0, J=0) to the next state, which is the v=1 state (n=1) with J=0. Because perhaps the energy of that transition is lower than the rotational transition.

Wait, but earlier calculation showed that the vibrational transition requires 2.65e-19 J, which is much higher than 9.2e-23 J.

Wait, but perhaps I messed up the calculation of B.

Wait, let's recheck the numbers.

Compute B again step by step.

μ = (20 amu * 2 amu)/(20 +2 ) =40/22 =20/11 ≈1.81818 amu.

Convert to kg: 1.81818 * 1.6605e-27 kg = approx.

1.8 *1.6605e-27 = 2.989e-27.

0.01818 *1.6605e-27 ≈ 2.998e-29.

Total μ ≈2.989e-27 + 0.02998e-27 ≈3.019e-27 kg.

R =2e-10 m.

I = μ R² =3.019e-27 * (2e-10)^2 = 3.019e-27 *4e-20 =1.2076e-46 kg m².

ħ =1.05457e-34 J s.

Now, B = ħ²/(2I) = (1.05457e-34)^2 / (2 *1.2076e-46 )

Compute numerator: (1.05457e-34)^2 = approx 1.112e-68.

Denominator: 2 * 1.2076e-46 = 2.4152e-46.

So B =1.112e-68 /2.4152e-46 = approx 4.6e-23 J.

So 2B =9.2e-23 J.

But the options don't match this.

Wait, perhaps the question is referring to the vibrational transition, and I made a mistake in the calculation of h w.

Wait, h is 6.626e-34 J s.

w is 4e14 rad/s.

E_vib = h w =6.626e-34 *4e14 =2.6504e-19 J.

p = E/c =2.65e-19 /3e8 = 8.83e-28 kg m/s =8.83e-28 Ns.

Looking at the options, option A is 1.9e-28, which is about half of this. Option D is 1.4e-28, which is about a fifth.

Hmm. So I'm not getting any of the options.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing a factor. Let me think about the energy levels again.

Wait, the vibrational energy levels are E_n = (n +1/2) h w.

So the transition from n=0 to n=1 requires ΔE = h w.

So that's correct.

But in that case, the photon's energy is 2.65e-19 J.

So p = E/c = 2.65e-19 /3e8 ≈8.83e-28 kg m/s =8.83e-28 Ns.

But the options don't have this. The closest option is A)1.9e-28, which is about half.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of h.

Wait, Planck's constant h is 6.62607015e-34 J s.

So h*w =6.62607015e-34 *4e14 = (6.62607015 *4 )e-20 =26.5042806e-20 J.

Which is 2.65042806e-19 J.

So p =2.65042806e-19 /3e8 = approx 8.8348e-28 Ns.

Looking at the options, none match exactly, but option A is 1.9e-28, which is about a factor of 4.64 lower.

Wait, perhaps I forgot to account for the reduced mass in another way.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering the transition from J=0 to J=1, but that would be 2B=9.2e-23 J, as before.

But again, the photon's momentum would be 3.06e-31 Ns, which isn't an option.

Hmm. So perhaps the question expects us to consider the vibrational transition, and perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the photon's momentum.

Wait, perhaps I should re-calculate p for E=2.65e-19 J.

p = E/c → 2.65e-19 J /3e8 m/s.

Let me compute 2.65e-19 /3e8 = (2.65 /3 )e-27 = approx 0.883e-27 →8.83e-28 kg m/s → 8.83e-28 N s.

Which is about 8.8e-28 Ns. The options are A)1.9e-28, D)1.4e-28.

Hmm. But 8.8e-28 isn't among the options. So this suggests that perhaps I'm missing a factor.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the question is in the rotational-vibration model, and the energy transition is not purely rotational or vibrational, but a combination.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the question is referring to the transition from the fundamental state (v=0, J=0) to the next state, which would be (v=0, J=1), which has an energy of 2B. So E_photon=2B.

But as I calculated, 2B is 9.2e-23 J, which leads to p=3.06e-31 Ns. Not among the options.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering the transition to the first excited state, which is (v=1, J=0). That would require E_photon=h w=2.65e-19 J, leading to p=8.83e-28 Ns.

But none of the options match that.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the options. Let's look at the options:

Option C is 1.1e-27 Ns.

Wait, 1.1e-27 Ns =1.1e-27 kg m/s.

E =p c =1.1e-27 *3e8 =3.3e-19 J.

Which is 3.3e-19 J. But h w is 2.65e-19 J. So this is higher than h w.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering the transition to the next state in the rotation-vibration model, which might involve both J and n changing.

But that would require more energy than either alone.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the question is about the energy levels when both rotation and vibration are considered, but the energy difference is the sum of the first rotational and first vibrational steps.

But that would be 2B + h w, which is larger than either.

So I'm confused. None of my calculations match the options.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate the vibrational energy again, but with a different approach.

Wait, or perhaps the question is considering the energy in terms of the vibrational frequency and the rotational constant in terms of wavenumbers or something else.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the question is considering that the molecule is in its fundamental state, which is v=0, J=0, and the next state is the first excited state, which could be either J=1 (rotational) or v=1 (vibrational). If the question is about which transition requires the least energy, that's the rotational, but the options don't match that.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering the first allowed transition, which might be a combination of rotation and vibration. But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the question is asking for the photon's momentum, not energy. So let's compute p for both possibilities.

If the energy is 2B=9.2e-23 J:

p=9.2e-23 /3e8 =3.066e-31 Ns.

If the energy is h w=2.65e-19 J:

p=2.65e-19 /3e8 =8.83e-28 Ns.

But neither match the options.

Looking at the options again:

A:1.9e-28

B:2.3e-27

C:1.1e-27

D:1.4e-28

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the question is considering the transition to the next state where both J and n increase, but that would require higher energy.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of B. Let me recheck.

Wait, perhaps B is not 4.6e-23 J but larger.

Wait, let me compute B again.

B = (ħ²)/(2 I )

= (1.05457e-34)^2 / (2 *1.2076e-46 )

Compute numerator: 1.05457e-34 squared.

1.05457^2 = approx 1.112.

So 1.112e-68.

Denominator: 2 *1.2076e-46 =2.415e-46.

So B =1.112e-68 /2.415e-46 = approx 4.6e-23 J.

Yes, that's correct.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the question is about the photon's momentum, but I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me compute it again.

E_photon =9.2e-23 J.

p =E/c =9.2e-23 /3e8 =3.066e-31 kg m/s.

But the options are all about 1e-27 to 2e-27 Ns. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, perhaps I should instead compute the angular momentum. Wait, no, the question is about momentum.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the calculation is in terms of the vibrational transition, but I'm missing a factor of 2 somewhere.

Wait, perhaps the model is that the molecule is in the first vibrational state (n=1), but that would require the photon's energy to be h w.

But earlier calculations show the momentum would be 8.83e-28 Ns, which isn't an option.

Wait, perhaps I should look for which option, when multiplied by c, gives either 2B or h w.

Option C is 1.1e-27 Ns.

E =p c =1.1e-27 *3e8 =3.3e-19 J.

Which is larger than h w (2.65e-19 J) but not matching 2B.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that I should have used the rotational constant in terms of cm^-1 or some other unit, but I don't see how that would help.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering the transition from the ground state to the first excited state, which is a combination of rotation and vibration, but I don't have the formula for that.

Alternatively, perhaps the question expects the photon's momentum to be calculated using the vibrational transition, but perhaps only a fraction of that.

Hmm. I'm a bit stuck here. Maybe I should consider if I made a mistake in the model.

Wait, another thought: in the non-rigid rotor model, the bond length varies with the vibrational state, which affects the moment of inertia. But when the molecule absorbs a photon, perhaps the bond length changes, leading to a change in I, which in turn affects the rotational energy.

But this might complicate things further, and I'm not sure how to approach it without more information.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is simply expecting the vibrational transition, and the options are expecting me to calculate p = h w / c.

So E_photon =h w → p = E/c →6.626e-34 *4e14 /3e8.

Wait, let's compute that.

6.626e-34 *4e14 = 2.6504e-19 J.

p =2.6504e-19 /3e8 = 8.8347e-28 kg m/s =8.8347e-28 Ns.

Looking at the options, the closest is option A:1.9e-28, which is about a factor of 4.64 lower.

Hmm. Unless I made a mistake in the calculation, perhaps the intended answer is option C:1.1e-27 Ns.

Wait, but 1.1e-27 *3e8 =3.3e-19 J, which is higher than h w.

Alternatively, perhaps I should recheck the calculation of E_photon.

Wait, what if the question is considering the transition to the first excited rotational state, but I messed up the calculation of B.

Wait, perhaps the rotational constant is calculated differently. Let me think.

Wait, another formula I've heard is B = (h)/(8 pi² c I), where c is speed of light. Wait, no, that's for wavenumbers.

Wait, no, the rotational constant is often expressed in terms of wavenumbers (cm^-1) as B̃ = h/(8 pi² c I), where c is speed of light in cm/s.

Wait, but that would give B̃ in cm^-1.

But I think for energy, B is calculated as h c B̃, which would be B = h c B̃.

Wait, perhaps I should compute B using this approach.

So, B̃ = h/(8 pi² c I ), then B = h c B̃.

Let me compute B̃.

h =6.626e-34 J s.

c=3e8 m/s →3e10 cm/s.

I =1.2076e-46 kg m² →1.2076e-46 kg (m)^2 →1.2076e-42 kg cm² (since 1m=100 cm, so m² =100 cm)^2 →100^2 cm² →1e4 cm². So 1 m² =1e4 cm².

So I =1.2076e-46 kg m² =1.2076e-46 *1e4 kg cm² =1.2076e-42 kg cm².

So B̃ = h/(8 pi² c I )

Plugging in the numbers:

h=6.626e-34 J s.

c=3e10 cm/s.

I =1.2076e-42 kg cm².

So,

B̃ =6.626e-34 / (8 * pi² *3e10 *1.2076e-42 )

Compute denominator: 8 * pi² ≈8 *9.8696 ≈78.9568.

So denominator =78.9568 *3e10 *1.2076e-42.

Let me compute this step by step.

3e10 *1.2076e-42 =3.6228e-32.

Multiply by78.9568: 3.6228e-32 *78.9568 ≈2.856e-30.

So B̃ =6.626e-34 / 2.856e-30 ≈2.319e-4 cm^-1.

Then, B = h c B̃.

h c =6.626e-34 *3e8 m/s → but wait, earlier units might have caused confusion. Alternatively, to compute B in Joules, B = h c B̃, where B̃ is in cm^-1.

So B =6.626e-34 J s *3e10 cm/s *2.319e-4 cm^-1.

Wait, 3e10 cm/s is the speed of light in cm/s.

So,

B =6.626e-34 *3e10 *2.319e-4.

Compute 6.626e-34 *3e10 =1.9878e-23.

Multiply by 2.319e-4 →1.9878e-23 *2.319e-4 ≈4.617e-27 J.

Wait, that's different from earlier calculation.

Wait, earlier I found B to be 4.6e-23 J, but now it's 4.6e-27 J.

Hmm. So this suggests I made a mistake in the earlier approach.

Wait, perhaps this is the correct formula for B. Let me double-check.

Wait, the rotational constant B is given by B = (ħ²)/(2I), which in SI units gives B in Joules.

Alternatively, B is sometimes expressed in terms of wavenumbers (cm^-1) as B̃ = (h c)/(8 pi² I), and then B = h c B̃ would give the same in Joules.

So let's recompute B using this method.

Compute B̃ = h c/(8 pi² I )

h =6.626e-34 J s.

c=3e8 m/s.

I=1.2076e-46 kg m².

So,

B̃ = (6.626e-34 *3e8 )/(8 pi² *1.2076e-46 )

Compute numerator: 6.626e-34 *3e8 =1.9878e-25.

Denominator:8 *pi² ≈78.9568 →78.9568 *1.2076e-46 ≈9.53e-45.

So B̃ =1.9878e-25 /9.53e-45 ≈2.086e19 cm^-1.

Wait, that can't be right. Because B̃ is usually small for diatomic molecules. For example, CO has a B̃ around 1.9 cm^-1.

So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, let me compute denominator again.

8 pi² I =8*(pi^2)*1.2076e-46.

So 8 pi² is approximately 78.9568.

78.9568 *1.2076e-46 =78.9568 *1.2076 = approx 95.3 →95.3e-46 =9.53e-45.

So denominator is 9.53e-45.

Numerator:6.626e-34 *3e8 =1.9878e-25.

So B̃ =1.9878e-25 /9.53e-45 = approx 2.086e19 cm^-1.

That's way too high; typical B̃ for diatomic molecules is about 0.1-10 cm^-1. So this suggests I made a mistake.

Hmm. Perhaps I made a mistake in the formula.

Wait, the correct formula for B̃ is B̃ = (h c)/(8 pi² I), where I is in kg cm².

Wait, I is in kg m². So I need to convert I to kg cm².

1 m=100 cm →1 m²=10^4 cm².

So I =1.2076e-46 kg m² =1.2076e-46 *1e4 kg cm² →1.2076e-42 kg cm².

Then,

B̃ = (6.626e-34 J s *3e10 cm/s ) / (8 pi² *1.2076e-42 kg cm² )

Compute numerator:6.626e-34 *3e10 =1.9878e-23.

Denominator:8 pi² *1.2076e-42 =78.9568 *1.2076e-42 ≈95.3e-42 →9.53e-41.

So B̃ =1.9878e-23 /9.53e-41 = approx 2.086e17 cm^-1.

That's way too high. So I must have made a mistake in the formula.

Wait, I think the formula is B̃ = h c/(8 pi² I c), where I c is in amu Å². Alternatively, perhaps I should use a different approach.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to stick with the initial approach and calculate B as 4.6e-23 J, leading to photon momentum of 3.06e-31 Ns. But since none of the options match, perhaps the intended approach is different.

Another thought: perhaps the question is referring to the transition where both J increases and n increases, such as (J=1, n=1), but that would require even more energy, which isn't the case for the lowest possible energy.

Hmm. Maybe the correct answer is option C) 1.1e-27 Ns, but I can't see how that would come about.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate the energy required to go from J=0 to J=1, which is 2B, and then find the momentum.

2B=9.2e-23 J.

p=E/c=9.2e-23 /3e8 =3.066e-31 Ns.

But this isn't an option.

Wait, perhaps the question is considering the vibrational transition, which is E=h w=2.65e-19 J.

p=8.83e-28 Ns.

Looking at the options, the closest is option A:1.9e-28 Ns.

But 8.83e-28 is about 4.65 times option A.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of h w.

Wait, perhaps the angular frequency w is given in terms of the vibrational frequency, but I might have mixed up the units.

Wait, the angular frequency w is given as 4e14 rad/s.

So E = h w =6.626e-34 *4e14 =2.6504e-19 J.

Which is correct.

I'm stuck. Maybe I should try to reverse-engineer the options.

Let's see:

Option C is 1.1e-27 Ns.

E =p c=1.1e-27 *3e8 =3.3e-19 J.

Which is 3.3e-19 J.

So 3.3e-19 J equals h w' where w' is the frequency.

w' = E/h =3.3e-19 /6.626e-34 ≈4.98e14 rad/s.

Which is close to the given w of 4e14 rad/s.

But not exactly matching.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering the transition from the ground state to the next state, which is a rotational state, but perhaps the calculation of B was done incorrectly.

Wait, perhaps the bond length R is given in angstroms, so 2 angstroms is 2e-10 m. Which is correct.

Another possibility: perhaps I should use the rotational constant B in terms of the vibrational frequency.

Wait, I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting me to compute the vibrational transition's momentum, but I'm not seeing how.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is referring to the photon's momentum in the rotational transition, but the calculation gives a value much smaller than the options, so perhaps I made a mistake in the moment of inertia.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in converting the bond length from angstroms to meters.

Wait, R=2 angstroms →2e-10 m. Correct.

Wait, perhaps I should compute I as (μ R²), but maybe R is in amu units or something else. No, R is in meters.

Wait, perhaps the formula for B is B = (h²)/(8 pi² I).

Ah! Wait, another formula for B is B = (h²)/(8 pi² I).

Because sometimes B is expressed as B = ħ²/(2I) = (h²)/(8 pi² I).

So let me compute B using this formula.

h=6.626e-34 J s.

I=1.2076e-46 kg m².

So,

B = (6.626e-34)^2/(8 pi² *1.2076e-46 )

Compute numerator: (6.626e-34)^2 =4.39e-67 J² s².

Denominator:8 pi² *1.2076e-46 =78.9568 *1.2076e-46 =95.3e-46 =9.53e-45.

So,

B =4.39e-67 /9.53e-45 = approx 4.6e-23 J.

Same as before. So no mistake here.

I'm really stuck. Maybe the intended approach is to consider the vibrational transition, and the correct option is A, but I'm missing a factor.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is asking for the photon's momentum to cause a transition to the next vibrational state, but the calculation gives 8.83e-28 Ns, which is close to option A (1.9e-28), but not matching.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of E_photon. Let me recompute h w.

h=6.626e-34 J s.

w=4e14 rad/s.

E_photon =h w =6.626e-34 *4e14 =2.6504e-19 J.

p = E_photon / c →2.6504e-19 /3e8 =8.8347e-28 kg m/s →8.8347e-28 Ns.

Hmm, which is still not matching any option.

Wait, perhaps the question expects the photon's energy to be the sum of the rotational and vibrational transitions. But that would be much higher.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is referring to the transition where J increases by 1 and n increases by 1, but that would require more energy than either alone.

In that case, the energy would be 2B + h w =9.2e-23 +2.65e-19= approx 2.6509e-19 J.

p=2.6509e-19/3e8=8.836e-28 Ns.

Again, no matching option.

Wait, perhaps the question is considering the photon's energy to be the vibrational energy per molecule, but perhaps I should use the reduced mass in a different way.

Hmm. I'm not making progress here. Perhaps the intended answer is option C:1.1e-27 Ns, but I can't see how that arises from any of the calculations.

Wait, perhaps the question is referring to the next state in the rotational model, but I'm missing something.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the molecule is in the ground rotational state (J=0) and ground vibrational state (n=0). The next state is the first excited state, which could be either J=1, n=0 or n=1, J=0. Which requires less energy, as we discussed, the J=1 transition.

But perhaps the photon's momentum is being calculated using the rotational transition, leading to p=3.06e-31 Ns, but none of the options match.

I think I'm stuck. Based on my calculations, the only possible answer is either the rotational transition, which gives a momentum not among the options, or the vibrational transition, which gives a momentum around 8.8e-28 Ns, which isn't an option either.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the vibrational energy.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the question is considering the transition from the ground state (v=0) to the first vibrational state (v=1), but the rotational state is not considered. So that would require a photon with energy h w, leading to p=8.83e-28 Ns, which isn't an option.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is referring to the rotational state but made a mistake in the options, but I can't know that.

Another possibility is that the question is using the vibrational frequency to compute the rotational energy, which doesn't make sense.

Hmm. Perhaps I should pick the option that is closest to my calculations. None match, but perhaps option C is 1.1e-27 Ns, which when multiplied by c gives 3.3e-19 J, which is close to the vibrational energy of 2.65e-19 J. But it's not exact.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is referring to the transition to the next state in the rotational model, but I'm missing a factor of 100 or 1000.

Wait, if I made a mistake in the calculation of B by a factor of 1e-3, B would be 4.6e-20 J, leading to p= (9.2e-20 J)/3e8 m/s →3.06e-28 Ns, which is still not matching any option.

Hmm. I'm really not sure. Based on the calculations, the vibrational transition's photon momentum is 8.83e-28 Ns, which isn't an option, and the rotational transition's is 3.06e-31 Ns.

Given that none of the options match, perhaps the intended answer is option C:1.1e-27 Ns, but I can't see why.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the question is considering the transition where both J and n change, but that's not the case for the lowest energy.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the question is mixing rotational and vibrational constants.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is using the wrong formula and the correct answer is option C, but I can't see how.

In the end, I'll have to go with the calculation I did earlier, which suggests that the photon's momentum is 3.06e-31 Ns, but since that's not an option, I might have made a mistake in the approach.

Wait, perhaps I should try to compute the rotational energy in terms of the vibrational frequency.

Wait, another approach: the rotational energy levels are quantized as E_rot = B J (J+1), where B is the rotational constant.

The vibrational energy is E_vib = (n + 1/2) h w.

The next state after the ground state would be either J=1 or n=1, whichever requires less energy.

As we calculated, 2B is 9.2e-23 J, and h w is 2.65e-19 J. So the rotational transition requires less energy, so the photon must have energy 2B.

But again, the momentum comes out to 3.06e-31 Ns, which isn't an option.

I think I'm stuck. I'll have to conclude that the correct answer is not among the options, but perhaps the intended approach is to consider the vibrational transition, leading to option A:1.9e-28 Ns.

But I'm not certain.


To determine the momentum of the photon required for the diatomic molecule to transition to the next state with the lowest possible energy, we analyze the energy differences in the quantum rotation-vibration model. The molecule is initially in the ground state, with both vibrational quantum number \(n = 0\) and rotational quantum number \(J = 0\). The next state with the lowest energy could involve either a rotational transition (\(J = 1\), \(n = 0\)) or a vibrational transition (\(n = 1\), \(J = 0\)).

### Key Calculations:
1. **Rotational Energy Transition**:
   - The rotational constant \(B\) is calculated using the formula:
     \[
     B = \frac{\hbar^2}{2I}, \quad \text{where } I = \mu R^2
     \]
     Here, \(\mu\) is the reduced mass, \(R\) is the bond length, and \(\hbar = 1.0545718 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J·s}\). The reduced mass \(\mu\) is:
     \[
     \mu = \frac{M_x M_y}{M_x + M_y} = \frac{20 \, \text{amu} \cdot 2 \, \text{amu}}{22 \, \text{amu}} \approx 1.818 \, \text{amu}
     \]
     Converting to kilograms (\(1 \, \text{amu} = 1.6605 \times 10^{-27} \, \text{kg}\)):
     \[
     \mu \approx 3.019 \times 10^{-27} \, \text{kg}
     \]
     The bond length \(R = 2 \, \text{Å} = 2 \times 10^{-10} \, \text{m}\), so:
     \[
     I = \mu R^2 = (3.019 \times 10^{-27}) \cdot (2 \times 10^{-10})^2 = 1.2076 \times 10^{-46} \, \text{kg·m}^2
     \]
     Substituting into \(B\):
     \[
     B = \frac{(1.0545718 \times 10^{-34})^2}{2 \cdot 1.2076 \times 10^{-46}} \approx 4.6 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J}
     \]
     The energy difference for the rotational transition (\(J = 0 \to J = 1\)) is:
     \[
     \Delta E_{\text{rot}} = 2B = 9.2 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J}
     \]
     The momentum of the photon is:
     \[
     p = \frac{E}{c} = \frac{9.2 \times 10^{-23}}{3 \times 10^8} \approx 3.07 \times 10^{-31} \, \text{kg·m/s} = 3.07 \times 10^{-31} \, \text{N·s}
     \]
     This value is much smaller than any of the provided options.

2. **Vibrational Energy Transition**:
   - The vibrational energy levels are quantized as:
     \[
     E_{\text{vib}} = \left(n + \frac{1}{2}\right) h \omega
     \]
     For the transition \(n = 0 \to n = 1\), the energy difference is:
     \[
     \Delta E_{\text{vib}} = h \omega = (6.626 \times 10^{-34}) \cdot (4 \times 10^{14}) = 2.65 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{J}
     \]
     The momentum of the photon is:
     \[
     p = \frac{E}{c} = \frac{2.65 \times 10^{-19}}{3 \times 10^8} \approx 8.83 \times 10^{-28} \, \text{kg·m/s} = 8.83 \times 10^{-28} \, \text{N·s}
     \]
     This value is also not directly matched by any of the options.

### Analysis of Options:
- **Option A (\(p = 1.9 \times 10^{-28} \, \text{N·s}\))**: This corresponds to a photon energy of:
  \[
  E = p \cdot c = (1.9 \times 10^{-28}) \cdot (3 \times 10^8) = 5.7 \times 10^{-20} \, \text{J}
  \]
  This is smaller than the vibrational energy transition (\(2.65 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{J}\)) and does not match the rotational energy transition.

- **Option B (\(p = 2.3 \times 10^{-27} \, \text{N·s}\))**: This corresponds to a photon energy of:
  \[
  E = p \cdot c = (2.3 \times 10^{-27}) \cdot (3 \times 10^8) = 6.9 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{J}
  \]
  This is larger than the vibrational energy transition and does not match the rotational energy transition.

- **Option C (\(p = 1.1 \times 10^{-27} \, \text{N·s}\))**: This corresponds to a photon energy of:
  \[
  E = p \cdot c = (1.1 \times 10^{-27}) \cdot (3 \times 10^8) = 3.3 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{J}
  \]
  This is larger than the vibrational energy transition and does not match the rotational energy transition.

- **Option D (\(p = 1.4 \times 10^{-28} \, \text{N·s}\))**: This corresponds to a photon energy of:
  \[
  E = p \cdot c = (1.4 \times 10^{-28}) \cdot (3 \times 10^8) = 4.2 \times 10^{-20} \, \text{J}
  \]
  This is smaller than the vibrational energy transition and does not match the rotational energy transition.

### Conclusion:
The calculated photon momentum for the rotational transition (\(3.07 \times 10^{-31} \, \text{N·s}\)) is much smaller than any of the provided options, and the vibrational transition (\(8.83 \times 10^{-28} \, \text{N·s}\)) does not match any option exactly. However, based on the given options, the closest match to the vibrational transition is **Option A (\(1.9 \times 10^{-28} \, \text{N·s}\))**, which may have been rounded or approximated in the question.
