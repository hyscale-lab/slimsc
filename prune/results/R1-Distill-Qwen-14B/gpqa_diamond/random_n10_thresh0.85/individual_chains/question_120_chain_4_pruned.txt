Okay, so I have this question about stars and their distribution in the sky. The question is a bit tricky, but I'll try to break it down. Let's see what it's asking.

The question says that stars are uniformly distributed in the sky. So that means the density of stars is the same everywhere. But wait, I remember that in reality, stars aren't exactly uniformly distributed, but for this question, we're assuming they are. So I can ignore any real-world complexities and just go with the assumption.

Now, the main part of the question is about how the number of stars per unit range of parallax (plx) changes with plx. Hmm, I think I need to figure out the relationship between parallax and the number of stars. Parallax is a measure of distance; the larger the parallax, the closer the star is because parallax is inversely proportional to distance. So, a star with a small parallax is very far away, and a star with a large parallax is nearby.

Wait, no, wait. Parallax (in arcseconds) is equal to 1 AU divided by the distance in parsecs. So, parallax plx = 1/d, where d is distance in parsecs. So as d increases, plx decreases. So, a star at 10 parsecs has a parallax of 0.1 arcseconds, and one at 1 parsec has a parallax of 1 arcsecond.

But how does this relate to the number of stars with a certain parallax? The question is about the number of stars per unit range of plx. So, for example, how many stars are there between plx and plx + dplx, as plx changes.

I think I should model this. Let's imagine that the stars are uniformly distributed in space, so the number density is constant. Let me denote the number density as n (stars per cubic parsec, maybe). But wait, since the sky is a sphere, perhaps I should think in terms of a spherical shell at a certain distance.

So, for a given distance d, the volume of a thin shell (like a spherical shell) between d and d + dd is 4πd² dd. The number of stars in this shell would be n * 4πd² dd.

But how does this relate to parallax? Since plx = 1/d, so d = 1/plx. Let me substitute that into the expression. So the number of stars in a shell at distance d is n * 4π (1/plx)^2 * (dd), where dd is the thickness in distance. But wait, if plx is a function of d, then the change in plx, dplx, is related to dd.

Because plx = 1/d, so dplx = - (1/d²) dd. So, solving for dd, we get dd = -d² dplx. The negative sign indicates that as d increases, plx decreases, but since we're dealing with absolute numbers, I can ignore the sign.

Putting it all together, the number of stars in a thin shell at parallax plx is:

Number = n * 4π (1/plx)^2 * (d² dplx / d²) )? Wait, maybe I'm getting confused here. Let me think again.

We have the number of stars between plx and plx + dplx. Let me express the number of stars as a function of plx.

We know that in terms of distance, the number of stars in a thin shell is n * 4πd² dd, where dd is the thickness in distance. And since plx = 1/d, then d = 1/plx, so dd = - d² dplx = - (1/plx)^2 dplx.

So the number of stars, when changing plx by dplx, would be:

Number = n * 4π (1/plx)^2 * |dd|

Because the stars are in a shell of thickness dd, which is related to dplx. So substituting dd:

Number = n *4π (1/plx²) * (1/plx²) dplx )

Wait, that would be 4π n (1/plx^4) dplx. But wait, that doesn't seem right. Let me double-check.

Wait, d = 1/plx. So, dd = d (d plx / d plx) )? Maybe another approach.

Let me consider the differential in terms of plx. So d (1/plx) = -1/(plx^2) d plx.

So, the volume element in terms of plx is 4π d^2 dd. Since d = 1/plx, d^2 is 1/(plx^2), and dd = (1/(plx^2)) d plx.

Wait, no. If plx = 1/d, then d plx = -1/d² dd. So, solving for dd, dd = - d² d plx.

But d = 1/plx, so dd = - (1/plx^2) d plx.

So, the volume element is 4π d^2 dd = 4π (1/plx^2) * ( - (1/plx^2) d plx )

Which is 4π (1/plx^4) (-d plx). The negative sign indicates that as plx increases, d decreases, but since we're considering the number of stars, the magnitude matters.

So, the number of stars per unit plx (d plx) is 4π n (1/plx^4) d plx.

Wait, but that's the number per d plx. So the number per unit plx (d plx) is proportional to 1/plx^4. But wait, that's not matching any of the options directly. The options are 1/plx^1, 1/plx^2, 1/plx^3, 1/plx^4.

But the question is phrased as "the number of stars per unit range of parallax (plx) changes with plx." So, the number per unit plx is proportional to 1/plx^4.

So according to this, the answer would be option A, which is ~ 1/plx^4.

But wait, I'm a bit confused because I've read before that the number of stars per unit parallax increases with plx^3. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, let me think differently. The number density is n stars per cubic parsec. The volume element at distance d is a sphere of radius d, so the number of stars within a distance d is (4/3)π d^3 n. But that's for all stars up to distance d.

But we're looking for the number of stars in a thin shell between d and d+dd, which is 4π d² dd * n.

Now, plx is 1/d. So, d = 1/plx, and dd = ( -1/plx² ) d plx.

So substituting:

Number of stars = 4π ( (1/plx)^2 ) * ( (1/plx^2 ) d plx ) * n.

Wait, because dd = (1
