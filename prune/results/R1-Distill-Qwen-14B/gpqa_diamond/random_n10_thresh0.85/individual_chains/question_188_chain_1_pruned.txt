Okay, so I've got this problem about a rhombohedral crystal, and I need to find the interplanar distance for the (111) plane. Hmm, I remember that interplanar distance is related to the crystal structure and the lattice parameters. Let me think about what I know.

Rhombohedral crystals have all sides equal, but the angles between them can be different. Wait, in this case, the angles alpha, beta, gamma are all 30 degrees. Oh, right, so it's a special case of a rhombohedral structure where all the angles are equal. That probably makes it a bit simpler.

The interatomic distance is given as 10 Angstrom. Wait, but wait—is that the lattice parameter 'a'? Because in a rhombohedral structure, 'a' is the edge length of the unit cell, right? So a = 10 Angstrom.

The question is about the (111) plane. Interplanar distance is often calculated using the formula involving the Miller indices (hkl). Oh yes, the formula is d = a/(sqrt(h² + k² + l² - 2hk cosα - 2hl cosβ - 2kl cosγ)), but wait, wait—that's for a general case. Or maybe I'm mixing it up with another formula.

Wait, another thought. For a cubic system, the formula is simpler: d = a / sqrt(h² + k² + l²
