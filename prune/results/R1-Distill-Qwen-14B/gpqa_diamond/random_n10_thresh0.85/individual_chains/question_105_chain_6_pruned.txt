Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let me read the question again.

So, the question is about a star that's similar to the Sun in radius. Half of its surface (hemisphere) is covered with dark spots. The filling factor is 20%, which I think means that 20% of that hemisphere is covered by spots. The star's effective temperature is 6000 K, and the spots are 1000 K cooler. Because the star is rotating, when we observe it, the brightness changes periodically, kind of like a light curve. This setup is similar to an exoplanet transiting in front of the star, causing a dip in brightness.

The question asks: if we didn't have those spots, what radius of a hypothetical exoplanet would produce the same brightness variation amplitude as the spots do now. So we need to compare the effect of the spots on the star's brightness to the effect of a planet transiting.

Hmm, okay, so I need to find Rpl/Rstar such that the transit depth (the dip in brightness) is the same as the dip caused by the spots.

Wait, but the spots are causing a variation due to the star's rotation. So when the spotted hemisphere comes into view, the brightness decreases, and when it's not, it goes back up. Oh wait, no, actually, for a star with spots, the brightness changes as spots come into view. So when the star rotates so that the spotted side is facing us, the total brightness is lower than when it's the unspotted side. So the variation is a dip when the spotted hemisphere is visible.

Now, a planet transiting would also cause a dip in brightness. The depth of that dip depends on the size of the planet relative to the star. So the transit depth is (Rp / Rstar)^2, because the area blocked is proportional to the square of the radius.

But in the case of spots, the situation is a bit different. The spots are cooler, so when they're facing us, the star's overall brightness decreases. The total brightness variation would be the difference between the unspotted star and the spotted one, as the spots rotate into and out of view.

Wait, the star's effective temperature is 6000 K, and the spots are 1000 K cooler, so they're at 5000 K. The filling factor is 20% of one hemisphere. So each spot covers 20% of a hemisphere. Let me think about how to calculate the change in brightness when the
