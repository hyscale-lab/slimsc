Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here about the Y-component of the intrinsic angular momentum operator for a muon. Hmm, let's see what the question is asking. So, the operator A_y is represented by a 2x2 matrix, which is given as A_y = c·S, where c is h/(4π), and S has rows (0 -i) and (i 0). 

Wait, I remember that the angular momentum operators in quantum mechanics are related to the Pauli matrices. Oh right, the Pauli matrices are σ_x, σ_y, σ_z, and they're used for spin-1/2 particles. So S here probably represents the spin operator multiplied by something. Oh wait, in this case, S is given, so A_y is c times S. 

The question is about finding the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of A_y. The options are about the properties of these eigenvalues and eigenfunctions.

Let me think. The eigenvalues of a matrix are found by solving the characteristic equation det(Ay - a I) = 0. Since Ay is a 2x2 matrix, this should be manageable.

So let me write down the matrix Ay first. The matrix S is [[0, -i], [i, 0]]. Multiply that by c = h/(4π). So each element of S is multiplied by c.

So Ay = c * S = [ [0, -i c], [i c, 0] ].

The eigenvalues a of Ay satisfy the equation:

det( Ay - a I ) = 0

Which is:

| (-a)       (-i c)      |
| (i c)      (-a)       | = 0

The determinant is (-a)(-a) - (i c)(-i c) = a² - (i c)(-i c)

Wait, let me compute (i c)(-i c). i * (-i) = -(i^2) = -(-1) = 1. So (i c)(-i c) = (c)^2 * 1. Because i * (-i) = 1. So the determinant becomes a² - (c²)(1) = 0.

So a² = c² → a = ±c.

Since c is h/(4π), the eigenvalues are a = ±h/(4π). So the eigenvalues are real? Wait, that doesn't make sense because I thought spin components have eigenvalues that are real. Oh wait, but wait, in this case, the
