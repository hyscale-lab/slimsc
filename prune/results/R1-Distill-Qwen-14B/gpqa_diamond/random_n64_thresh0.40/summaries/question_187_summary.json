The detectability of a star depends on its apparent magnitude, as fainter stars (higher apparent magnitude) are harder to detect. The apparent magnitude \\( m \\) can be calculated using the distance modulus formula:\n\n\\[\nm = M + 5 \\log_{10}(d / 10),\n\\]\n\nwhere \\( M \\) is the absolute magnitude and \\( d \\) is the distance in parsecs.\n\n### Analysis of Each Option:\n1. **Option a) Canopus**: Canopus is a very bright star with an apparent magnitude \\( m \\approx -0.74 \\). Since it is much brighter than the detectability threshold, it is detectable.\n\n2. **Option b) Polaris**: Polaris, the North Star, has an apparent magnitude \\( m \\approx 2.0 \\). This is also brighter than the threshold, making it detectable.\n\n3. **Option c) Star with \\( M = 15 \\), \\( d = 10 \\, \\text{pc} \\)**:  \n   \\[\n   m = 15 + 5 \\log_{10}(10 / 10) = 15 + 0 = 15.\n   \\]  \n   With \\( m = 15 \\), this star is detectable.\n\n4. **Option d) Star with \\( M = 15 \\), \\( d = 200 \\, \\text{pc} \\)**:  \n   \\[\n   m = 15 + 5 \\log_{10}(200 / 10) = 15 + 5 \\times 2.301 \\approx 21.5.\n   \\]  \n   With \\( m = 21.5 \\), this star is fainter than the detectability threshold and is not detectable.\n\n5. **Option e) Star with \\( M = 15 \\), \\( d = 5 \\, \\text{pc} \\)**:  \n   \\[\n   m = 15 + 5 \\log_{10}(5 / 10) = 15 - 1.505 \\approx 13.5.\n   \\]  \n   With \\( m = 13.5 \\), this star is detectable.\n\n6. **Option f) Star with \\( M = 15 \\), \\( d = 50 \\, \\text{pc} \\)**:  \n   \\[\n   m = 15 + 5 \\log_{10}(50 / 10) = 15 + 5 \\times 1.699 \\approx 23.5.\n   \\]  \n   With \\( m = 23.5 \\), this star is much fainter than the detectability threshold and is not detectable.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe detectability threshold for ESPRESSO is assumed to be \\( m \\approx 20 \\). Stars with apparent magnitudes \\( m < 20 \\) are detectable. Based on the calculations:\n- **Detectable stars**: Canopus (a), Polaris (b), \\( M = 15, d = 10 \\, \\text{pc} \\) (c), \\( M = 15, d = 5 \\, \\text{pc} \\) (e).\n- **Not detectable**: \\( M = 15, d = 200 \\, \\text{pc} \\) (d), \\( M = 15, d = 50 \\, \\text{pc} \\) (f).\n\nThus, **4 stars** are detectable.\n\n**Answer: C**"
