Okay, so I need to find the energy of the RHIC when the speed of the nucleus is 0.96c. Hmm, let me think about this step by step.

First, the nucleus in question is Li with 3 neutrons. Wait, Li is lithium, right? So, lithium has an atomic number of 3, meaning it has 3 protons. If it has 3 neutrons, that makes the isotope Li-6 because 3 protons + 3 neutrons = 6 nucleons. So the mass number A is 6.

The energy I'm looking for is the total energy of the nucleus when it's moving at 0.96c. I remember that in relativity, the total energy of a moving object includes its rest mass energy and kinetic energy. But wait, actually, the total energy (gamma times rest energy) is what's important here.

So the formula for gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²). Since v is 0.96c, let me calculate that.

v = 0.96c, so v² = (0.96)^2 c² = 0.9216 c².

1 - v²/c² = 1 - 0.9216 = 0.0784.

Then sqrt(0.0784) is 0.28, because 0.28*0.28 is 0.0784. So gamma is 1/0.28 ≈ 3.5714.

Wait, let me double-check that calculation. 0.28
