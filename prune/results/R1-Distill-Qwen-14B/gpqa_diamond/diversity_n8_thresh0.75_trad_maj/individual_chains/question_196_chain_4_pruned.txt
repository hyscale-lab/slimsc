Okay, so I have this physics problem in front of me about a relativistic harmonic oscillator. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through.

The question says we have a 1-dimensional relativistic harmonic oscillator with mass m and maximum amplitude A. It obeys Hooke's law, F = -kx. The task is to find the maximum speed v_max. The options are A, B, C, D. 

Wait, harmonic oscillators, both classical and relativistic. In the classical case, the maximum speed of a harmonic oscillator can be found using energy conservation. The potential energy is (1/2)kA² at maximum displacement, and at maximum speed, all that potential energy converts into kinetic energy. So the kinetic energy (KE) would be ½ m v_max² = ½ k A². Solving that gives v_max = sqrt(kA²/m). That's option C, but wait, the question is relativistic, so I can't use that directly.

Right, because in relativity, the kinetic energy isn't just (1/2)m v². The correct expression for kinetic energy in special relativity is (γ - 1)mc², where γ is the Lorentz factor, γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²). So I need to use relativistic energy conservation.

So the total energy of the oscillator is the sum of relativistic kinetic energy plus the potential energy. But wait, in the harmonic oscillator, energy oscillates between kinetic and potential. At maximum amplitude, the oscillator is at rest in terms of velocity, so all energy is potential. At maximum velocity, all energy is kinetic.

Wait, but in the classical case, the potential energy is (1/2)kA². So in the relativistic case, the total energy should be equal to the sum of the rest mass energy and the potential energy at maximum displacement. Or wait, maybe not. Let me clarify.

In the harmonic oscillator, the potential energy is (1/2)kx², which in the maximum case, x = A. So the potential energy U is (1/2)kA². At that point, the kinetic energy is zero, so the total energy E is U = ½ kA².

But wait, in relativity, the total energy includes the rest mass energy. So maybe the total energy is the sum of rest energy and the potential energy. Or is the potential energy part of the total energy? I'm a bit confused here. Let me think again.

In the non-relativistic case, the total mechanical energy is the sum of kinetic and potential. But when velocity
