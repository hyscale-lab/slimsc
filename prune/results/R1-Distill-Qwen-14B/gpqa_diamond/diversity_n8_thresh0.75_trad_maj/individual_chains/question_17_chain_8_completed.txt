Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to think it through. The question is about the concentration of calcium ions in a solution containing a stochiometric Ca-EDTA complex. Hmm, I remember that EDTA is a chelating agent, right? It forms complexes with metal ions.

The problem gives me a 0.02 M solution of the Ca-EDTA complex. The K for the complex is 5x10^10. Oh wait, K is the formation constant, I think. So the formation constant is the equilibrium constant for the formation of the complex. Right.

So the reaction should be something like Ca²+ + EDTA^4- ↔ CaEDTA^2-. Or maybe it's written as Ca²+ + EDTA^4- → CaEDTA²−. Well, the K would be [CaEDTA²−]/([Ca²+][EDTA^4−]). Yeah, I think that's correct.

But wait, the problem says it's a stochiometric solution. Oh, stochiometric means the molar amounts are in exact ratios. So the initial concentrations of Ca²+ and EDTA^4- would be the same because they react 1:1 to form the complex. But wait, in the solution, is the complex Ca-EDTA? So the initial concentration of the complex is 0.02 M.

So in solution, the complex dissociates a little. Let me think. The complex can dissociate into Ca²+ and EDTA^4−. So the dissociation equation is CaEDTA²− ⇌ Ca²+ + EDTA^4−.

The formation constant K is given as 5e10, which is a large number, meaning the complex is very stable. So the dissociation constant would be the inverse of K, right? Because K is for formation, so the dissociation K would be 1/K. So Kdissociation = 1/(5e10) = 2e-11.

Wait, no. Wait, K for the formation is Kf = [CaEDTA²−]/([Ca²+][EDTA^4−]). So if the solution is 0.02 M CaEDTA²−, then at equilibrium, the concentrations of Ca²+ and EDTA^4− would be x each, because the stoichiometry is 1:1.

Wait, but wait. Let's model it. Let's say the complex is C, which is CaEDTA²−. The initial concentration of C is 0.02 M. The dissociation is C ⇌ Ca²+ + EDTA^4−.

At equilibrium, [C] = 0.02 - x, [Ca²+] = x, [EDTA^4−] = x.

But since K is 5e10, which is huge, the dissociation is minimal. So x will be very small compared to 0.02. So we can approximate [C] ≈ 0.02.

So the dissociation expression is Kd = [Ca²+][EDTA^4−]/[C] = (x)(x)/(0.02) = x² / 0.02.

But wait, Kd is the dissociation constant, which is 1/Kf. So Kd = 1/(5e10) = 2e-11.

So setting up the equation: x² / 0.02 = 2e-11.

Solving for x²: x² = 0.02 * 2e-11 = 4e-13.

Taking square root: x = sqrt(4e-13) = 2e-6.5? Wait, sqrt(4e-13) is sqrt(4)*sqrt(1e-13) = 2 * 1e-6.5. Wait, 1e-13 is (1e-6.5)^2. So 1e-6.5 is about 3.16e-7, but let me calculate more accurately.

Wait, 4e-13 is 4 * 10^-13. The square root of that is sqrt(4)=2, sqrt(1e-13)=1e-6.5. So 2e-6.5. 10^-6 is 1e-6, 10^-7 is 0.1e-6. 6.5 is halfway, so 3.16e-7. So 2 * 3.16e-7 is 6.32e-7. Hmm, wait 2e-6.5 is the same as 2e-6.5.

Wait, 10^-6.5 is equal to 10^(-6) * 10^(-0.5) = 1e-6 * 0.3162 ≈ 3.162e-7. So 2 * 3.162e-7 is approximately 6.324e-7, which is about 6.3e-7.

So x is approximately 6.3e-7 M.

Looking at the options, option C is 6.3e-7 M. So the concentration of Ca²+ would be that, right?

Wait, let me double-check my steps. The formation constant is Kf = 5e10, so the dissociation is 1/Kf, which is 2e-11. The initial concentration of the complex is 0.02 M. The dissociation gives x for calcium and EDTA.

The expression is x²/(0.02) = 2e-11, so x² = 0.02 * 2e-11 = 4e-13. X is sqrt(4e-13)=2e-6.5=6.32e-7. So yes, option C is correct.


To determine the concentration of calcium ions ([Ca²⁺]) in a 0.02 M solution of the Ca-EDTA complex, we start by considering the dissociation equilibrium:

\[
\text{CaEDTA}^{2-} \leftrightharpoons \text{Ca}^{2+} + \text{EDTA}^{4-}
\]

The formation constant for the complex is given as \( K_f = 5 \times 10^{10} \). The dissociation constant \( K_d \), which is the inverse of \( K_f \), is:

\[
K_d = \frac{1}{K_f} = \frac{1}{5 \times 10^{10}} = 2 \times 10^{-11}.
\]

At equilibrium, the concentrations of \(\text{Ca}^{2+}\) and \(\text{EDTA}^{4-}\) are equal, denoted as \( x \), while the concentration of the complex \(\text{CaEDTA}^{2-}\) is approximately \( 0.02 - x \). Since \( K_d \) is very small, \( x \) will be negligible compared to 0.02, so we approximate \([CaEDTA^{2-}] \approx 0.02 \, \text{M}\).

The equilibrium expression for \( K_d \) is:

\[
K_d = \frac{[\text{Ca}^{2+}][\text{EDTA}^{4-}]}{[\text{CaEDTA}^{2-}]} = \frac{x^2}{0.02}.
\]

Substituting \( K_d = 2 \times 10^{-11} \):

\[
\frac{x^2}{0.02} = 2 \times 10^{-11}.
\]

Solving for \( x^2 \):

\[
x^2 = 0.02 \times 2 \times 10^{-11} = 4 \times 10^{-13}.
\]

Taking the square root:

\[
x = \sqrt{4 \times 10^{-13}} = 2 \times 10^{-6.5}.
\]

Since \( 10^{-6.5} = 3.16 \times 10^{-7} \), we find:

\[
x = 2 \times 3.16 \times 10^{-7} = 6.32 \times 10^{-7}.
\]

Thus, the concentration of calcium ions is approximately \( 6.3 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M} \).

From the options provided, the correct answer is:

**C) \( 6.3 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M} \)**.
