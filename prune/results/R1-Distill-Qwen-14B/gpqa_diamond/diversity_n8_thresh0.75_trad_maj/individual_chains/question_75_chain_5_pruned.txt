Okay, so I've got this question about a transgenic mouse model and some issues with overexpressing a protein. Let me try to think it through step by step.

The scenario is that someone is trying to create a transgenic mouse model where GADD45G is overexpressed. They're using a construct with an inducible promoter, and they added a hemagglutinin tag at the N-terminus. They transfected Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells with this construct using Lipofectamine, and selected for antibiotic resistance. But when they tested the expression, they couldn't overexpress the protein as expected.

The DNA sequence provided is for the plus strand of their construct. They noticed something wrong in the sequence, which is causing the issue. The options given are A to D, and I need to figure out which one is correct.

First, I think I should look at the DNA sequence to find any issues. The problem might be in the coding sequence of the construct. Let's see.

The construct has the coding sequence for GADD45G with an HA tag at the N-terminus. The HA tag is a short peptide, typically YPYDVPDYA, but in the sequence, the first part would be the start codon followed by the HA tag and then the GADD45G sequence.

Looking at the DNA sequence given, the very beginning is 5' ATG TAC CCA TAC GAT GTT CCA GAT... Wait, ATG is the start codon. Then TAC is the next codon. TAC is Tyrosine (Tyr). But the HA tag is a specific sequence. Let me think: the HA tag is added as a sequence at the N-terminus, so the first part of the coding sequence should be the HA tag followed by GADD45G.

Wait, but HA is a protein tag, so the DNA sequence would encode that. Let me reconstruct the HA sequence. HA tag is YPYDVPDYA, which is 10 amino acids. The DNA sequence for that would be:

YPYDVPDYA â†’ let's break it down into codons.

Y = TAC, P = CC A or CCA (depending on the codon), Y = TAC, D = GAT, V = GTT, P = CCA, D = GAT, Y = TAC, A = GCT.

Wait, maybe I should double-check. Alternatively, the HA tag's DNA sequence is TAC CCA TAC GAT GTT CCA GAT TAC GAG TAC GAA CCA TTT GCT TAC GAA CCA GCT TAC.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting ahead of myself. But looking at the given sequence, after the ATG start codon, the next codons are TAC (which is Tyr), then CCA (Pro), then TAC (Tyr), then GAT (Asp), GTT (Val), etc. Hmm. So the first few codons are TAC CCA TAC GAT GTT CCA... So the amino acids would be Tyr, Pro, Tyr, Asp, Val, Pro, etc.

Wait a minute, the HA tag's amino acid sequence is YPYDVPDYA. So the first few amino acids after the start
