Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about calculating the enthalpy of neutralization when three different solutions are mixed. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through it step by step.

Alright, the problem states that we're mixing three solutions: 500 mL of 0.2 M HCl, 300 mL of 0.3 M H2SO4, and 200 mL of 0.5 M Ba(OH)2. And we need to find the enthalpy change, right?

Wait, enthalpy of neutralization usually refers to the heat released when an acid reacts with a base. But here, we have two acids and one base. Hmm, but wait, H2SO4 is a diprotic acid, so it can donate two H+ ions. Ba(OH)2 is a strong base and can provide two OH- ions per formula unit. So maybe they're reacting with each other?

Wait, but wait a second. When you mix acids and bases, they can neutralize each other. Let me check the possible reactions here.

First, I need to figure out how much H+ and OH- are present in each solution. Because the neutralization reaction is H+ + OH- → H2O, and the enthalpy change is per mole of H+ neutralized.

HCl is a strong acid, so it dissociates completely. For each mole of HCl, we get one mole of H+. So let's calculate moles of HCl. 

Moles = Molarity × Volume (in liters). So for HCl: 0.2 M × 0.5 L = 0.1 moles. So 0.1 moles of H+ from HCl.

H2SO4 is a diprotic acid. In solution, it dissociates into 2 H+ and SO4^2- ions. But wait, for strong acids like H2SO4, the first dissociation is complete, but the second might not be. Wait, no, H2SO4 is a strong acid in its first dissociation (H2SO4 → 2H
