Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try my best to figure it out. Let's read the question again.

The question is about finding the concentration of calcium ions in a solution. The solution contains 0.02 M of a stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex. The pH is ideal, and the temperature is 25°C. The given formation constant, K_Ca-EDTA, is 5x10^10. The options are A to D, and I need to choose the correct one.

Hmm, right. So I remember that EDTA is a chelating agent, which means it binds metal ions like calcium. The complex formed is called a chelate, and the formation constant (Kf) tells us how stable the complex is. The higher the Kf, the more stable the complex.

Wait, so the problem gives the concentration of the Ca-EDTA complex as 0.02 M. Since the complex is formed in a 1:1 ratio (I think) between Ca²+ and EDTA^4-, then the concentration of the complex [CaY²-] is 0.02 M. But I need to find the concentration of free calcium ions, [Ca²+], in the solution.

I remember the formula for the formation constant. For a complex like CaY²-, the formation constant Kf is given by:

Kf = [CaY²-] / ( [Ca²+][Y^4-] )

But wait, EDTA is usually in a deprotonated form. Oh right, and at the ideal pH, we can assume that all the EDTA is in the Y^4- form, which is the one that binds the metal. So the EDTA concentration is just [Y^4-], and I don't have to worry about the other protonated forms.

So rearranging the Kf equation to solve for [Ca²+] would give me:

[Ca²+] = [CaY²-] / ( Kf * [Y^4-] )

Wait, but wait. What's the relation between [Y^4-] and [CaY²-] in the solution? Because the solution is 0.02 M CaY²-, which is the complex. But EDTA is present in the same solution as well. So the total EDTA would be the sum of free Y^4- and the complex.

Wait no, wait. Wait, the CaY²- is the complex, and the total
