Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm supposed to figure out the molecular symmetry group of product E. Hmm, let's try to break this down step by step.

First, I'll read the problem again carefully. The reaction details are a bit involved, but I think I can piece them together.

The first reaction: Solid A reacts with 8 equivalents of gas B to form bright red product C. So, A + 8B → C. I'm thinking about what kind of compounds react in such a way. Maybe something like a metal reacting with a halogen? For example, sodium (Na) reacting with chlorine gas (Cl₂) to form NaCl. But wait, sodium chloride is a white solid, not red. Hmm.

Wait, bright red products could be something else. Oh! Maybe it's sulfur trioxide? Or perhaps something like a transition metal compound. Alternatively, maybe it's a reaction that forms a complex with multiple atoms. Let me think: if B is a diatomic gas, like O2, but that doesn't immediately make sense. Or perhaps B is something like Cl2. Wait, wait, another thought: maybe A is sulfur (S) and B is oxygen (O2). So, 8 equivalents would suggest 8 O atoms. Sulfur reacting with oxygen to form SO4³−? No, wait, that's more when it's in solution. Or maybe S reacting with O2 to form SO3, which is a liquid but not red. Hmm, not sure yet.

Alternatively, perhaps A is a transition metal. Let's say A is iron (Fe), and B is sulfur (S). Iron reacts with sulfur to form iron sulfide, but I'm not sure about the color. Or maybe copper reacting with sulfur? Copper(II) sulfide is black, so that might not fit.

Wait, the product C is bright red. That makes me think of something like mercury(II) sulfide, which is red, but that's a solid. Alternatively, maybe it's a nitrate or sulfate. Hmm. Alternatively, considering the reaction with water later, perhaps C is a nitrate. Because later, when C reacts with water, it reforms A plus two different acids F and G. One of them is a strong acid, the other a weak acid.

Wait, if C is a nitrate, say, then when it reacts with water, maybe it forms the metal hydroxide and nitric acid (a strong acid) and maybe another acid. Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps C is a sulfate. Let me think: for example, if A is aluminum, then B might be sulfur, but I
