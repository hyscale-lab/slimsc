Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I need to find the kinetic energy of the product particles in a decay reaction. Let me think through this step by step. 

The question is about a pion decay: Pi(+) → mu(+) + nu. The pion is initially stationary, and I know its rest mass is 139.6 MeV. The muon has a rest mass of 105.7 MeV. I need to find the kinetic energies of the muon and the neutrino. The options are given, so I can probably plug the numbers in and see which one matches.

Wait, but how do I approach this? I remember from my physics classes that in particle decay problems, energy and momentum must be conserved. Since the pion is at rest, the total momentum before decay is zero. So the momenta of the muon and neutrino must be equal in magnitude and opposite in direction to ensure momentum conservation. That makes sense.

Let me jot down the knowns:
- Mass of Pi(+) (m_pi) = 139.6 MeV/c²
- Mass of mu(+) (m_mu) = 105.7 MeV/c²
- The neutrino is nearly massless, so I'll consider its mass m_nu ≈ 0.

The total energy before decay is just the rest energy of the pion, which is m_pi * c². But since we're working in units where c=1, it's just 139.6 MeV.

After decay, the total energy is the sum of the energies of the muon and neutrino. So energy conservation gives:
E_pi = E_mu + E_nu

And because momentum is conserved, the magnitudes of their momenta are equal. Let's denote the momentum of the muon as p, so the neutrino's momentum is also p but in the opposite direction. Wait, but neutrinos are also spin-1/2 particles; but since they're massless (approximated here), their energy is just |p|c. But since c=1, E_nu = p.

So, for the muon, its total energy E_mu is given by the relativistic energy formula:
E_mu = sqrt( (p c)^2 + (m_mu c²)^2 ) / c² ? Wait, no, actually, in units where c=1, it's sqrt(p² + m_mu^2 ). So E_mu = sqrt(p² + m_mu²).

Similarly, the neutrino's energy is E_nu = p, since its mass is zero.

So putting it all together, energy conservation gives:
m_pi = sqrt(p² + m_mu²) + p

Because E_pi is m_pi (since it's at rest). So the equation to solve is:
139.6 = sqrt(p² + (105.7)^2 ) + p

Hmm. Let me write this equation as:
sqrt(p² + (105.7)^2 ) = 139.6 - p

If I square both sides to eliminate the square root:
p² + (105.7)^2 = (139.6 - p)^2
Expanding the right side:
= (139.6)^2 - 2*139.6*p + p^2

So the equation becomes:
p² + 105.7² = 139.6² - 279.2 p + p²

Subtract p² from both sides:
105.7² = 139.6² - 279.2 p

Let me compute the squares. 

105.7^2 is approximately (I can compute this). 105^2 is 11025, 0.7^2 is 0.49; and 2*105*0.7=147. So 105.7^2 ≈ 11172.49 MeV².

139.6^2 is 139.6 * 139.6. Let me compute that: 140^2 is 19600. So 139.6 is 0.4 less than 140. So (140 - 0.4)^2 = 140^2 - 2*140*0.4 + 0.4^2 = 19600 - 112 + 0.16 = 19488.16 MeV².

So substituting back into the equation:
11172.49 = 19488.16 - 279.2 p

Now, let's rearrange to solve for p:
279.2 p = 19488.16 - 11172.49
Compute the right side: 19488.16 - 11172.49 = 8315.67

So p = 8315.67 / 279.2 ≈ Let's compute that.

Dividing 8315.67 by 279.2: Let me see. 279 * 30 = 8370, which is a bit larger than 8315.67. So 30 would be 8370, which is 54.33 higher. So maybe around 29.8?

Wait, 279.2 * 29.8 = let's compute 279.2 * 30 = 8376, minus 279.2 * 0.2 = 55.84. So 8376 -55.84 = 8320.16. But our numerator is 8315.67, which is about 4.5 less. So 29.8 - (4.5 / 279.2) ≈ 29.8 - 0.016 ≈ 29.784.

Wait, but wait, I think I might have messed up the calculation. Let me double-check.

Wait, 279.2 multiplied by 29.8 is:

279.2 * 30 = 8376, then subtract 279.2 * 0.2 = 55.84, so 8376 -55.84 = 8320.16. But our difference was 8315.67. So 8320.16 is 4.49 more than 8315.67. So to adjust, maybe 29.8 - (4.49 / 279.2) ≈ 29.8 - 0.016 ≈ 29.784.

But wait, perhaps it's easier to compute 8315.67 / 279.2.

Let me compute 279.2 * 29 = 279.2 *20=5584, 279.2*9=2512.8 → total 5584+2512.8=8096.8. Hmm, 8096.8 is less than 8315.67. The difference is 8315.67 -8096.8=218.87.

So 218.87 divided by 279.2 is approximately 0.782. So 29 + 0.782 =29.782.

So p ≈ 29.78 MeV/c.

Wait, but that's the momentum of the muon. So the neutrino also has the same momentum magnitude, but since it's massless, its energy is equal to p.

So E_nu = p ≈29.78 MeV.

Now, what about the muon's energy? E_mu = sqrt(p² + m_mu²) = sqrt(29.78^2 +105.7^2 )

Compute 29.78^2: Approximately 886.8.

105.7^2 = 11172.49 as before.

So adding them: 886.8 +11172.49 =12059.29.

Taking square root: sqrt(12059.29) ≈ 109.81 MeV.

Wait, but the muon's rest mass is 105.7 MeV, so its kinetic energy would be E_mu - m_mu. So E_mu is 109.81, so KE_mu =109.81 -105.7 =4.11 MeV.

Wait, but wait, that can't be right. Wait, because the total energy of the muon is 109.81 MeV, which is just a bit over its rest mass. So the KE is about 4.11 MeV, which matches one of the options. Let me check the options.

Looking at the options:

Option D) 4.12 MeV, 29.8 MeV. Hmmm, this seems close. Our calculation got p ~29.78 MeV, so E_nu is about 29.8 MeV. And the KE of the muon is about 4.11 MeV, which rounds to 4.12.

But wait, wait a second. Let me double-check the calculations because I might have made a mistake in the initial equation setup.

Wait, the initial equation was:

139.6 = sqrt(p² + 105.7^2 ) + p

Wait, but this implies that the energy after decay is the sum of the muon's energy and the neutrino's. But wait, in reality, the muon's energy is sqrt(p² + m_mu^2 ), and the neutrino's energy is p. So this equation is correct.

But let me think again about the energy. The pion's rest energy is 139.6 MeV. The muon's energy is higher than its rest mass, and the neutrino has energy p.

But when I compute E_mu as 109.81, and the neutrino as 29.78, the sum is 109.81 + 29.78 =139.59, which is very close to 139.6, so that's correct.

So the KE of the muon is 4.11 MeV, and the neutrino's KE is 29.78 MeV.

But wait, the problem is asking for the KE of the product particles. So the muon has KE ~4.1 MeV, and the neutrino's KE is ~29.8 MeV.

Looking at the options, option D says 4.12 and 29.8. That looks correct.

Wait, but another thought: the neutrino's energy is p, which is 29.78 MeV, so that's its total energy (since for massless particles, E = pc). So its kinetic energy is the same as its energy, because it has no rest mass energy. So the neutrino's KE is 29.78 MeV, which is about 29.8 MeV as in option D.

So the KE of the muon is 4.11 MeV, and the neutrino's is 29.8 MeV. So the correct option is D.


To solve the problem, we analyze the decay of a stationary pion, **Pi(+) → mu(+) + nu**, using conservation of energy and momentum. The rest masses are given as **m_pi = 139.6 MeV/c²** and **m_mu = 105.7 MeV/c²**, with the neutrino's mass approximated as zero.

### Conservation of Energy
The total energy before decay is the rest energy of the pion, **E_pi = m_pi = 139.6 MeV**. After the decay, the total energy is the sum of the energies of the muon and neutrino:
\[
E_pi = E_mu + E_nu
\]
where:
- \(E_mu = \sqrt{p^2 + m_mu^2}\) (relativistic energy of the muon),
- \(E_nu = p\) (energy of the massless neutrino, since \(E = pc\)).

### Conservation of Momentum
Since the pion is stationary, the momenta of the muon and neutrino are equal in magnitude but opposite in direction:
\[
p_{\text{mu}} = p_{\text{nu}} = p
\]

### Solving for Momentum \(p\)
Using energy conservation:
\[
139.6 = \sqrt{p^2 + 105.7^2} + p
\]
Let \(x = p\). The equation becomes:
\[
139.6 = \sqrt{x^2 + 105.7^2} + x
\]
Squaring both sides:
\[
139.6^2 = (\sqrt{x^2 + 105.7^2} + x)^2
\]
Expanding and simplifying:
\[
139.6^2 = x^2 + 105.7^2 + 2x\sqrt{x^2 + 105.7^2}
\]
\[
139.6^2 - 105.7^2 = 2x\sqrt{x^2 + 105.7^2}
\]
\[
x = \frac{139.6^2 - 105.7^2}{2\sqrt{x^2 + 105.7^2}}
\]
Solving numerically:
\[
x \approx 29.78 \, \text{MeV/c}
\]

### Energy of the Neutrino
The neutrino's energy is equal to its momentum:
\[
E_nu = p \approx 29.78 \, \text{MeV}
\]

### Energy of the Muon
The muon's total energy is:
\[
E_mu = \sqrt{p^2 + m_mu^2} = \sqrt{29.78^2 + 105.7^2} \approx 109.81 \, \text{MeV}
\]
The muon's kinetic energy is:
\[
KE_mu = E_mu - m_mu = 109.81 - 105.7 \approx 4.11 \, \text{MeV}
\]

### Final Answer
The kinetic energy of the muon is approximately **4.12 MeV**, and the kinetic energy of the neutrino is approximately **29.8 MeV**. Comparing with the options, the correct answer is:

**Answer: D**
