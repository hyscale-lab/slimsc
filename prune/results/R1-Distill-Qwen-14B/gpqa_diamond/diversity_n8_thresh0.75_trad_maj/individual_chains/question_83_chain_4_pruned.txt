Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm not super confident with titration calculations, but let's try to work through it step by step. 

The question is about titrating acetic acid with NaOH. The problem gives me some details. Let me read it again.

We have 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid. Then we dilute it with 20.00 cm³ of water. After that, we titrate this solution with 0.1 M NaOH. The question asks for the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point. The options are A, B, C, D, each with two pH values.

First, I need to figure out what happens at 25% titration and at the equivalence point. I'll probably have to calculate both cases.

Let me start by understanding the initial setup.

When you mix 20 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid with 20 cm³ of water, the volume doubles. So the concentration will change. Let's calculate the new concentration after dilution.

The initial moles of acetic acid (CH3COOH) are Molarity × Volume. Wait, volume is in cm³, so I should convert that to liters. Oh wait, 1 cm³ is 1 mL, so 20 cm³ is 0.02 L.

Moles = M × V = 0.05 M × 0.02 L = 0.001 moles.

After adding 20 cm³ (0.02 L) of water, the total volume is 40 cm³ (0.04 L). So the new concentration is moles / volume = 0.001 / 0.04 = 0.025 M. So the diluted acetic acid is 0.025 M.

Wait, wait, wait. Let me double-check that calculation. 20 cm³ is 0.02 L. So initial moles: 0.05 * 0.02 = 0.001 mol. Then adding 20 cm³ (0.02 L) of water, total volume is 40 cm³ (0.04 L). So 0.001 / 0.04 = 0.025 M. Yep, that's correct.

Now, when we titrate this diluted acetic acid with 0.1 M NaOH. The reaction is CH3COOH + NaOH → CH3COO^-Na+ + H2O.

At the equivalence point, all the acetic acid will have been neutralized to its conjugate base, acetate ions. For the equivalence point, pH is determined by the hydrolysis of acetate.

But first, let's think about the 25% titration point. 25% of what?

Wait, wait. Titration usually refers to the point where 25% of the acetic acid has been neutralized by NaOH.

So, let's figure out the volume of NaOH needed to reach 25% of the equivalence point.

But perhaps it's easier to calculate using moles.

Wait, let me approach it this way.

At equivalence point, the moles of NaOH added will be equal to the mo
