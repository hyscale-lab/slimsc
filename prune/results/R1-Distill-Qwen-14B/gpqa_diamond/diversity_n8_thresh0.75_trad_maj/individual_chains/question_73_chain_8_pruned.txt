Hmm, okay, so I've got this physics problem here about two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds, and I need to find their relative speed and the total energy of the system. Let's see, I'm a bit rusty on relativity, but I'll try to think this through step by step.

Alright, the problem states that the two astronauts have masses 2m and 3m. Their speeds are 0.6c and 0.5c respectively in the positive x-direction. The question is about finding the relative speed between them and the total energy of the system.

Wait, wait. So, relative speed in relativity isn't as straightforward as just subtracting the two speeds because of the way velocities add up relativistically. Right, the formula for relative velocity in special relativity is different from classical mechanics. Oh right, the formula is v_rel = (u - v)/(1 - (u v)/cÂ²), where u and v are the velocities of the two objects relative to the same frame. Wait, but wait, in this case, both are moving in the same direction, so their relative speed would be the difference of their speeds, but I can't just subtract them normally because of the relativity of velocity addition.

Wait, so astronaut A is moving at 0.6c, astronaut B at 0.5c. So from A's frame, what's B's speed? Or vice versa? Or do I have to compute the relative speed correctly using the relativistic velocity addition formula.

Wait, but the options have v_rel as 0.1c, 0.14c, etc. So let's compute (0.6c - 0.5c)/(1 -
