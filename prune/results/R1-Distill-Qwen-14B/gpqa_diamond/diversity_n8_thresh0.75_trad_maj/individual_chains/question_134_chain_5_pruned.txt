Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about enthalpy of neutralization. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but let's see if I can work through it.

The question says that we're mixing three solutions: 500 mL of 0.2 M HCl, 300 mL of 0.3 M H2SO4, and 200 mL of 0.5 M Ba(OH)2. And we need to calculate the enthalpy of neutralization. The options are given in kcal and kJ, so I should probably remember the standard enthalpy values.

Wait, what's the enthalpy of neutralization again? Oh right, it's the amount of heat released when an acid reacts with a base to form water. The standard value is about 57 kJ per mole of H+ ions, I think. But wait, sometimes it's given in kcal, like 13.6 kcal/mol. Hmm, I should double-check that. Oh yeah, because 57 kJ is roughly 13.6 kcal since 1 cal is about 4.184 J. So 57,000 J ÷ 4.184 ≈ 13.6 kcal.

But wait, the problem is mixing three solutions. So I need to figure out how much acid and base are reacting. Let me break it down.

First, let's find the moles of each acid and base.

Starting with HCl: It's a strong acid, so each mole gives one H+.

Molarity is 0.2 M, volume is 500 mL (which is 0.5 L). Moles = M * V = 0.2 * 0.5 = 0.1 moles. So 0.1 moles HCl. So H+ from HCl is 0.1 moles.

Next, H2SO4: It's a strong acid too, and each mole gives 2 H+ ions because it's diprotic. The molarity is 0.3 M, volume 300 mL (0.3 L). Moles = 0.3 * 0.3 = 0.09 moles H2SO4. So H+ from H2SO4 is 0.09 * 2 = 0.18 moles.

So total H+ from acids is 0.1 + 0.18 = 0.28 moles.

Now the base: Ba(OH)2. It's a strong base, so each mole gives 2 OH- ions. Molarity is 0.5 M, volume 200 mL (0.2 L). Moles = 0.5 * 0.2 = 0.1 moles Ba(OH)2. So OH- from Ba(OH)2 is 0.1 * 2 = 0.2 moles.

Wait, but when acid and base react, the H+ and OH- combine. So the neutralization reaction is H+ + OH- → H2O. Each mole of H+ reacts with a mole of OH-.

So, the total H+ available is 0.28 moles, and OH- is 0.2 moles. So which is the limiting reactant?

Well, OH- is 0.2, H+ is 0.28. So OH- will run out first. So only 0.2
