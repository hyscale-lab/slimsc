Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me try to break it down.

The starting material is 1,3-dibromoadamantane. I remember that adamantane has a diamondoid structure, so 1,3-dibromoadamantane would have bromine atoms on two non-adjacent carbons of the adamantane skeleton. 

First step: heating with excess KOH at 240°C. KOH is a strong base, and when dibromides are treated with a base, usually an elimination reaction occurs. Since there are two bromine atoms, maybe it's a double elimination. So, if each Br leaves, we'd form two alkenes? Wait, but in a molecule like 1,3-dibromoadamantane, elimination would lead to the formation of an allene (a molecule with two adjacent double bonds) because the two Brs are on adjacent carbons in the adamantane structure? Or wait, 1,3-dibromoadamantane—so maybe the positions are not adjacent but separated by a certain number of carbons. Hmm, I think in adamantane, the positions 1 and 3 are on different faces, but I'm not entirely sure. Maybe it's better to think about the product. The product after KOH is a light yellow solid. Also, the 1H NMR shows a peak at 4.79 ppm for 2H. That's usually indicative of an -OH group or maybe an ether. Wait, but KOH is a base, so maybe elimination to form an epoxide? No,
