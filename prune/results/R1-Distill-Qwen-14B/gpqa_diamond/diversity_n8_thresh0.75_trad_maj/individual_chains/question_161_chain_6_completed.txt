Okay, so I've got this question about electron microscopes and the mean free path of gas molecules. Hmm. Let me think through what's being asked here.

So the scenario is Mike is working on a high-resolution transmission electron microscope. He's using a really high accelerating voltage, 1000 kV. He connected vacuum pumps to create an ultra-high vacuum in the sample compartment. The pressure is less than 10^-9 Torr, which is super low. The idea is to minimize gas molecules because that should help with electron microscopy by reducing scattering.

But even in that ultra-high vacuum, some gas particles are still present. They detected that using a mass spectrometer. Mike calculated the mean free path of these gas molecules as λ1. The mean free path depends on factors like pressure, temperature, and the volume of the compartment.

Then, when he starts the electron beam, he notices something interesting. The mean free path changes from λ1 to λ2. And the temperature is the same, so that can't be the reason for the change.

So the question is, what can we conclude about λ2 compared to λ1? The options are A to D.

Wait, what's the mean free path? Mean free path λ is the average distance a molecule travels between collisions. The formula I remember is λ = 1/(√2 n π d²), where n is the number density and d is the collision diameter. Alternatively, another formula connects λ with pressure P, temperature T, and molar mass M. Oh right, the formula is λ = (k*T)/(√2 π d² n), but n is the number density, which is P/(k*T * M) times something... Wait, maybe it's better to use the formula where λ is proportional to 1/(P). Because if pressure goes down, the mean free path increases.

Wait, no, in a vacuum, lower pressure means fewer molecules, so the mean free path increases. So λ is inversely proportional to pressure. Oh wait, but if the pressure is already super low, like 1e-9 Torr, and when the electron beam is on, perhaps something else happens.

Wait, when the electron beam is active, the electrons are moving at high speeds. If the gas is present, the electrons can interact with the gas molecules. So the electrons might cause the gas molecules to ionize or something, or maybe the gas molecules get excited. But this might change the effective pressure or the behavior of the gas.

Alternatively, the electron beam could cause the gas molecules to be scattered more. But wait, the mean free path is for the gas molecules. So if the electron beam is on, does that affect the gas molecules' motion? Or perhaps the electrons are causing gas molecules to be knocked out of the compartment.

Wait, another thought: thermal motion is important for the gas molecules' movement. But in the scenario, the temperature remains the same. So thermal factors shouldn't change λ.

Wait, maybe when the electron beam is on, the gas molecules might experience additional forces. Or perhaps the beam causes some of the gas molecules to be ionized, and charged particles behave differently. If gas molecules are ionized, they can't collide in the same way because they might stick to the walls or other surfaces. Or maybe the ionized gas can be pumped out more efficiently.

Wait, but how would that change the mean free path? If gas is ionized, they might have longer paths because the ionized particles could be removed from the system. Or perhaps they stick to the walls, reducing the number of gas molecules in the compartment. If the number of molecules decreases, the mean free path λ increases.

Wait, but Mike already had a mean free path λ1 under ultra-high vacuum. When he starts the electron beam, the mean free path becomes λ2.

So if the gas is being removed or affected by the beam, the pressure would decrease, making λ2 larger than λ1. But the answer options don't have λ2 > λ1 as a possibility. Wait, looking at the options:

Option A: λ2 >= 1.22*λ1
Option C: λ2 < λ1
Option D: λ1 < λ2 <1.22*λ1

Wait, so the options suggest that the possible conclusion is whether λ2 is larger or smaller than λ1.

Wait another angle: the mean free path is also related to electron scattering. When the electron beam is on, the gas molecules might cause more scattering of the electrons, which could affect the observed image. But the question is about the mean free path of the gas molecules, not the electrons.

Wait, maybe the electron beam causes the gas molecules to be excited or ionized, which could change their effective size for scattering. But that's more about scattering cross-section than mean free path. Or perhaps the electron beam causes gas molecules to stick to the walls, effectively reducing the number of gas particles in the compartment.

Hmm. So if some gas molecules are being removed, the number density n decreases. Since λ is inversely proportional to n (because λ ~ 1/(n d²)), if n decreases, λ increases.

So λ2 should be larger than λ1. But looking at the options, option A is λ2 >= 1.22 λ1, which is an increase by at least 22%. Option D is between λ1 and 1.22λ1. So why would that be the case?

Wait, but wait. The mean free path is calculated based on the ideal gas behavior. If the electron beam causes the gas to be in a non-ideal state, perhaps by ionizing it, the effective pressure could change. But if the pressure is already super low, maybe the presence of the electron beam doesn't change the pressure much. So perhaps the mean free path doesn't change. But that would make λ2 = λ1, which is option B. But that would imply Mike's observation was incorrect, which seems unlikely.

Alternatively, perhaps the electron beam causes the gas to be ionized, which leads to more gas sticking to the walls, thereby effectively reducing the pressure. So the pressure decreases, so λ increases.

If Mike's initial calculation was λ1 assuming no beam, but with the beam on, the actual λ is larger. So λ2 > λ1. So which option fits that? Option A says λ2>=1.22λ1. Option D is λ2 between λ1 and 1.22 times.

Wait, but why would the mean free path be more than 1.22 times? Maybe the factor comes from something else.

Another angle: the mean free path in electron microscopy can be affected by other factors, like the charge state of the gas molecules. For example, in ultra-high vacua, gas molecules can be charged, leading to different scattering behavior. But I'm not sure how that affects the mean free path.

Alternatively, when the electron beam is on, it could be that the gas molecules are being bombarded by electrons, causing them to move more, thereby increasing the collision rate. Wait, but that would decrease the mean free path. Hmm, that contradicts the earlier thought.

Wait, if the electron beam is causing the gas molecules to have more energy, perhaps their speeds increase. Because mean free path is λ = v * τ, where τ is the mean time between collisions. If speed v increases, but if the number density remains the same, then τ decreases because they move faster and collide more often. So λ would be v * τ. If v increases and τ decreases, but how? Let me think: The mean free path is given by λ = 1/(√2 n π d²), which is a function of n and d. If the temperature is the same, the speed v (mean speed) is proportional to sqrt(T), so same T, same v. So if n is same, λ remains same.

But if the electron beam is causing the gas to have higher temperature, but the question says the sample compartment temperature remained same. So perhaps the electron beam isn't heating the gas.

Wait, perhaps the presence of the electron beam introduces additional factors. For example, the beam might cause the gas to be ionized, which can lead to a higher rate of gas being pumped away. Because ionized particles can be more easily captured by the vacuum pumps. So if more gas is being pumped away, the number density n decreases, leading to a longer mean free path λ.

So if the number of gas molecules decreases, λ increases. So λ2 would be greater than λ1. The options that fit this are A or D.

But why would the mean free path be exactly 1.22 times? 1.22 is approximately sqrt(1.5), but that's not a familiar factor. Alternatively, 1.22 could be a factor in some formula, like de Broglie wavelength or something else.

Wait, perhaps the mean free path is being calculated based on the gas's behavior under electron bombardment. The presence of the electron beam could cause the gas to be in a different state, perhaps with a higher effective temperature? But the question says the temperature is the same, so that can't be it.

Another thought: The mean free path could be affected by the electron beam's scattering. But that's about the electrons, not the gas's mean free path. So perhaps the gas's mean free path is not changing, but the electron's mean free path is. But the question is about the gas's mean free path.

Wait, perhaps the presence of the electron beam causes gas molecules to be excited, leading to more collisions. But that would imply more collisions, shorter mean free path, so λ2 < λ1. But that's the opposite of what I thought earlier.

Alternatively, the electron beam could induce some sort of electric field that causes the gas molecules to move in a particular direction, reducing their random motion and effectively increasing the mean free path? Not sure about that.

Wait, maybe the main effect is that the electron beam's presence leads to gas molecules being ionized, which can then be pumped out more effectively. So the pressure in the chamber would decrease, which would mean a lower n, leading to a higher λ.

So if the pressure decreases, the mean free path increases, so λ2 > λ1. So which option is that? Looking at the options, only options A and D have λ2 greater than λ1.

So why would λ2 be ≥1.22λ1 or between λ1 and 1.22λ1?

Wait, perhaps the initial calculation (λ1) was done without considering the effects of the electron beam, which would have a certain effect on the gas molecules. Maybe when the beam is on, the effective pressure is lower than before, so λ2 is higher.

But why would it be at least 1.22 times? I'm not sure about that. Alternatively, maybe the presence of the electron beam increases the rate of gas molecule collisions, but I think that's the opposite effect.

Wait, another approach. Let's think about the formula for the mean free path. The mean free path λ is given by:

λ = 1/(√2 n π d²)

where n is the number density, and d is the collision diameter.

n is given by PV/(kT), using the ideal gas law. So n = P/(kT) * (R T / P) ??? Wait, no, PV = nRT, so n = PV/(RT).

Wait, the formula for λ is:

λ = (k*T)/(√2 π d² n)

Substituting n from ideal gas law, n = P/(k*T) * (R*T/PV?) Hmm, maybe a better formula is:

λ = (k*T)/(√2 π d² n) = (k*T * V)/(√2 π d² * P)

But I'm not entirely confident. Alternatively, another formula connects λ directly with pressure:

λ = (k*T)/(√2 π d² n) = (k*T)/(√2 π d² (P/(R T)) ) ) 

Wait, perhaps it's better to think in terms of how λ relates to pressure. Since λ is inversely proportional to pressure, lower pressure means higher λ.

So when the electron beam is turned on, if the pressure decreases (because of more efficient pumping or gas molecules being removed), then λ increases. So λ2 would be greater than λ1. So which option says λ2 > λ1?

Looking back, the options are:

A) λ2 >=1.22*λ1

C) λ2 < λ1

D) λ1 < λ2 <1.22*λ1.

So if λ2 is greater than λ1, then options A and D are possible.

But why would it be exactly 1.22 times? I don't recall that number. Alternatively, perhaps the presence of the electron beam causes the gas molecules to have a higher effective temperature, but the question says the temperature is the same. So that can't be.

Wait, maybe the electron beam causes gas molecules to be more likely to stick to the walls. So when the beam is on, more gas molecules are lost, reducing the number density n. So n decreases, so λ increases.

But how much does n decrease? If the decrease is significant enough, λ could be 1.22 times or more.

But without specific numbers, it's hard to say. However, the question states that Mike accurately determined λ1 before the beam was on. Then, when the beam was on, he found that the mean free path was no longer λ1 but λ2.

So the options are about possible relationships between λ1 and λ2.

Alternatively, maybe when the electron beam is on, the gas is in a different state. Perhaps the gas becomes partially ionized, and the ionized particles have a different effective size, thus changing d². But in that case, the effect on λ depends on whether d² increases or decreases.

Wait, if a molecule is ionized, it might have a larger effective diameter due to charge repulsion, which would increase d², hence decrease λ. Or perhaps the ionized particles have a smaller effective diameter if they're attracting each other. Hmm, not sure.

Alternatively, if the gas becomes a plasma, the mean free path could be dominated by Coulomb interactions, which might behave differently. But that's probably beyond ultra-high vacuum conditions.

But given the context, perhaps the key factor is that the electron beam causes gas molecules to be removed more effectively, thus decreasing the pressure and increasing λ.

So λ2 > λ1.

Which options have λ2 > λ1? Options A and D.

But why would it be λ2 >=1.22 λ1 (A) or between λ1 and 1.22 (D)?

Unless there's a specific factor when the electron beam is on. Let me think about the physics of electron microscopes.

In electron microscopy, when the electron beam is on, there's a phenomenon called "beam-induced charging" or "beam damage." The electron beam can cause the sample or the surrounding gas to charge, which can lead to various effects. In the case of gas, perhaps the gas molecules are either repelled or attracted to the charged areas, which could change their distribution or cause them to be more likely to stick to surfaces.

Wait, if the gas molecules acquire a charge, they can be more easily captured by the vacuum pump's ion getter or other pumping mechanisms. So more gas is pumped out, leading to lower pressure, longer mean free path.

But how much does the pressure drop? Without specific data, we can't say if λ2 is more than 1.22 times λ1 or between λ1 and 1.22 times.

Alternatively, perhaps the electron beam causes some of the gas molecules to be ionized, and thus these ionized molecules are pumped away more efficiently. So the number of neutral gas molecules decreases, leading to lower n and thus higher λ.

But why would λ2 be exactly 1.22 times? Hmm, 1.22 could be the square root of 1.5, but I'm not sure.

Another thought: perhaps the mean free path calculation under an electron beam takes into account the scattering of electrons by gas molecules, which could affect the effective cross-section. But the question is about the gas's mean free path, not the electrons.

Alternatively, maybe when the electron beam is on, gas molecules are excited and their effective collision diameter increases, leading to a shorter mean free path. But that would give λ2 < λ1, which is option C.

Wait, but why would the collision diameter increase? If the gas molecules are ionized, perhaps they have higher effective sizes due to charge, leading to more collisions. But I'm not certain.

Wait, in reality, when using an electron microscope, the presence of the electron beam can lead to a phenomenon called "beam heating," which might cause gas molecules to be more mobile or increase in temperature. But the question says the temperature is the same, so that's not the case.

Alternatively, the electron beam can cause gas molecules to be ionized, and these ions are then more effectively pumped away. So the pressure drops, leading to a longer mean free path.

So λ2 is greater than λ1. So the options are A or D.

But why would λ2 be exactly 1.22 times? I'm not sure. Without more specific information, perhaps the most logical conclusion is that λ2 is greater than λ1. So the correct option is either A or D.

Wait, another angle. The initial mean free path λ1 was calculated without the electron beam. When the beam is on, perhaps the gas's mean free path is altered because the electrons are providing additional energy to the gas molecules, causing more collisions. But that would imply a shorter mean free path.

Wait, but if electrons are striking gas molecules, that could cause the gas to heat up or ionize. But if the gas is ionized, the mean free path could be longer because ionized particles may have different behavior. Alternatively, if the gas is ionized, it can stick to the walls or the sample, leading to a lower effective pressure.

Wait, perhaps when the electron beam is on, the gas is ionized, and the ionized particles are more likely to be captured by the vacuum system, leading to a lower pressure. So n decreases, so λ increases. So λ2 > λ1.

In that case, λ2 would be larger than λ1, so options A or D.

But in the absence of specific factors, perhaps the correct answer is A, because it says λ2 is greater than or equal to 1.22 times λ1. But I'm not sure why 1.22 is the factor.

Alternatively, perhaps the scenario is that the electron beam causes the gas to be more active, leading to more collisions. But that would reduce the mean free path. But I'm not certain.

Wait, let me think about the possible options again.

Option C says λ2 < λ1. So if the mean free path is shorter, that would imply that the gas molecules are colliding more often, which would happen if the pressure increased. But why would the pressure increase when the beam is on? That doesn't seem to make sense.

Alternatively, if the electron beam causes the gas to be more ionized, perhaps the effective cross-section for collisions increases, leading to more frequent collisions and a shorter mean free path. Thus, λ2 < λ1, which is option C.

But I'm getting conflicting thoughts here. Earlier, I thought that the beam would cause gas to be pumped away, increasing λ. But now, considering the collision diameter increasing, it would decrease λ.

Which effect is dominant? That's unclear.

Alternatively, perhaps Mike saw that the mean free path was shorter, which would imply that the gas molecules were colliding more, making λ2 < λ1. But why would that happen?

Wait, perhaps the electron beam causes the gas to be in a higher energy state, moving faster, leading to higher collision rates. But again, if speed increases, but n is same, λ remains same.

Hmm. Alternatively, the presence of the electron beam could cause gas molecules to be excited, perhaps increasing the effective collision diameter. For example, if the gas molecules are vibrating more or have a larger effective size when excited, then the cross-section d² increases, leading to a shorter mean free path.

So in that case, λ2 would be less than λ1, which would make option C correct.

But this contradicts my earlier thought that the beam would pump more gas away, increasing λ.

This is a tough one. Let me think about possible real-world scenarios. In electron microscopy, when you have a vacuum and the electron beam is on, sometimes the gas can become a problem because the beam can cause gas molecules to be released or to move. Wait, no, in ultra-high vacuum, the pressure is already very low. So perhaps the presence of the beam could cause more scattering, making the mean free path shorter.

Wait, but Mike's setup is under ultra-high vacuum, so the presence of the beam wouldn't cause a significant pressure change, but perhaps the scattering cross-section of the gas with the electrons affects the electrons' mean free path, but not the gas's own mean free path.

I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let me try to approach it from another angle.

The question says that when the electron beam is on, the mean free path of the gas molecules changes from λ1 to λ2. What factors can cause a change in the mean free path of the gas when the electron beam is present?

The main factors are:

1. Changes in pressure (n).
2. Changes in collision diameter (d).
3. Changes in temperature (which affects velocity, but the question states temperature is the same).

If pressure decreases (n decreases), λ increases.

If collision diameter increases (d increases), λ decreases.

If the beam causes pressure to decrease, λ increases. If the beam causes d² to increase, λ decreases.

Which effect dominates?

In ultra-high vacuum, the pressure is already very low, so n is small, and λ is long. The presence of the electron beam may cause additional ionization, which could lead to some gas being pumped away, thus decreasing n further. So pressure decreases, so λ increases.

Alternatively, ionization could cause the gas molecules to have larger effective diameters, leading to more collisions and shorter λ.

But which effect is more significant?

I'm not sure. But perhaps the pumping effect is more significant. So more gas is removed, leading to a longer mean free path.

Thus, λ2 > λ1. So the options are A or D.

But why 1.22 times?

Wait, maybe the factor comes from the equation relating the mean free path to the electron beam's properties. Or perhaps it's a standard factor in electron microscopy.

Alternatively, perhaps the mean free path is calculated considering the electron beam's impact. For instance, the mean free path for electron scattering might involve a factor of 1.22 when considering the de Broglie wavelength or something else, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the factor of 1.22 is derived from the equation where the mean free path is inversely proportional to the square root of the pressure or something like that. But without more context, it's hard to say.

Given that, perhaps the correct answer is that λ2 is greater than λ1. Among the options, that's A or D.

But the options don't specify a direction, just a relationship.

Wait, the question gives that the mean free path is no longer equal to λ1 but becomes λ2. It doesn't specify whether it's larger or smaller. The options only have A, C, and D as possibilities for λ2.

But considering the scenario, I think that λ2 is greater than λ1 because the electron beam causes gas to be removed, leading to lower pressure and higher mean free path.

So the options I'm considering are A and D.

Now, why would λ2 be only slightly larger than λ1 (option D) or much larger (option A)?

If the electron beam only slightly reduces the pressure, then λ2 would be a bit larger than λ1. But if the beam significantly reduces the pressure, λ2 could be much larger.

So without specific data, we can't be certain. But the question asks what can we conclude.

Wait, perhaps the presence of the electron beam doesn't change the mean free path because the vacuum is already so good. But the question states that when the beam is on, the mean free path changes.

Alternatively, perhaps the beam's presence doesn't change the gas's mean free path. So λ2= λ1, but the options say that's a possibility (option B). But the question says Mike made an observation, implying that λ2 is different.

So option B is unlikely.

So the options are A, C, or D.

If the beam causes gas to be removed, λ increases. So λ2>λ1.

So the correct options are either A or D.

But the question is about what we can conclude. The only way to conclude that λ2 is greater is if we know that it must be greater. However, without knowing the exact cause, perhaps the only conclusion is that λ2 is greater, but the options don't have a 'λ2>λ1' option except A and D.

Wait, another thought. The mean free path is calculated based on gas density, which depends on pressure. If under the electron beam, the gas is ionized and pumped away, the pressure drops, so n drops. Thus, λ increases.

But how much does n drop? If P is already 1e-9 Torr, and the beam causes P to drop further, perhaps by some factor. The mean free path is inversely proportional to pressure, so if pressure decreases by a factor of x, λ increases by x.

But Mike accurately determined λ1 before the beam was on. When the beam is on, the pressure is lower, so λ2 = λ1 * (P_initial / P_beam_on).

So if P_beam_on is less than P_initial, λ2 is larger.

So, λ2 > λ1.

So the options are either A or D.

But why would the mean free path be exactly 1.22 times? Maybe it's a standard factor when considering electron scattering.

Alternatively, perhaps the presence of the electron beam introduces a factor of 1.22 into the mean free path calculation. I'm not sure, but perhaps it's a standard factor in some formula.

Wait, I'm trying to recall something about the mean free path in electron microscopy. Oh wait, the Schottky effect or something related to electron beam-induced phenomena. Alternatively, perhaps the de Broglie wavelength of the electrons is a factor, but I don't see the connection.

Alternatively, in electron microscopy, the effective mean free path of electrons is often considered, which can be different from the gas's mean free path. But the question is about the gas's mean free path.

Alternatively, perhaps the electron beam causes the gas to expand, thus reducing pressure. That would increase λ.

But without specific data, I can't be certain.

Given all this, I think the correct conclusion is that λ2 is greater than λ1, so the answer is either A or D.

But the options don't have 'λ2 > λ1' as a general option. The options are:

A) λ2 >= 1.22*λ1

C) λ2 < λ1

D) λ1 < λ2 <1.22*λ1

If the only conclusion is that lambda2 is greater than lambda1, then the only possible options are A and D. But without knowing the exact factor, it's hard to choose between A and D.

Wait, perhaps the question is a trick. The mean free path of gas molecules is determined by their own pressure and temperature. When the electron beam is on, the gas's pressure doesn't change because the vacuum pumps are already working. So λ remains the same.

But that would make λ2 = λ1, which is option B. But the question says Mike found λ2 different.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the presence of the electron beam causes the gas to be in a non-ideal state, but the temperature is the same, so the mean free path might not change. But the question says Mike accurately determined λ1, but then found a different λ2.

I'm getting stuck. Maybe I should think about the physics more carefully.

The mean free path λ for gas molecules is given by:

λ = 1/(√2 n π d²)

where n is the number density of gas molecules, and d is the collision diameter.

n = P/(k*T) * (R T / P V) ? Wait, no, n is P/(k*T) * something.

Wait, ideal gas law is PV = nRT. So n = PV/(RT).

Thus, λ = 1/(√2 (PV/(RT)) π d² )

Simplify: λ = RT/(√2 π d² P)

So λ is proportional to T and inversely proportional to P.

Given that T remains the same, λ is inversely proportional to P.

So if when the beam is on, the pressure P decreases (because gas is being pumped away or removed), then λ increases. So λ2>λ1.

Therefore, the correct conclusion is λ2>λ1.

So the options are A or D.

But the question states that the mean free path is no longer equal to λ1; so λ2 is different.

If the pressure is lower, λ2 must be higher.

So the answer must be either A or D.

But which one?

The question is about what we can conclude based on the scenario. The scenario doesn't provide any numbers, so perhaps the only conclusion is that λ2>λ1. But the options don't have a 'λ2>λ1' option except A and D.

Wait, looking at the options again:

A) λ2 >= 1.22*λ1

D) λ1 < λ2 <1.22*λ1

So the only way to choose between A and D is to figure out whether λ2 is more than 1.22 times or between λ1 and 1.22 times.

But without more information, perhaps the correct answer is that λ2 is larger than λ1. So the options are either A or D.

But the question gives the scenario where Mike found that the mean free path was no longer λ1. So the change could be either way.

Wait, perhaps the mean free path is not affected by the electron beam because the mean free path is for the gas molecules, which are sparse. So the presence of the beam may not significantly change the pressure, so λ2 is approximately equal to λ1. But that would imply Mike's observation was incorrect, which is option B, but the question says he made the observation.

Alternatively, the mean free path of the gas could be shorter because the beam is causing more collisions. But again, it's unclear.

Hmm, perhaps the correct answer is option C: λ2 < λ1. Because when the electron beam is on, gas molecules are more likely to collide with the beam, leading to shorter mean free path. But I'm not confident.

Alternatively, perhaps the presence of the electron beam doesn't affect the gas's mean free path, so λ2=λ1. But the question says Mike found a change.

This is really challenging.

Wait, perhaps the question is about the electron's mean free path, but the wording says the gas's mean free path.

Alternatively, perhaps the electron beam causes gas molecules to be more mobile, which could affect the mean free path. Or perhaps the gas is more likely to stick to the walls because of the beam, which would decrease n and increase λ.

If the gas sticks to the walls, n decreases, so λ increases.

Thus, λ2>λ1.

So the options are A or D.

But without knowing how much n decreased, we can't say whether it's more than 1.22 times or not.

Therefore, the correct answer must be that λ2 is greater than λ1. The options that fit this are A and D.

But which one is correct? Since the question doesn't provide numerical data, perhaps the correct answer is that λ2 is greater than λ1, with no exact factor. But the options don't have a general 'greater than' option.

Wait, perhaps the answer is C: λ2 < λ1. Because when the electron beam is on, gas molecules are more likely to be scattered by the beam, which could cause them to collide more often, decreasing the mean free path.

But I'm not sure.

Wait, another thought: The mean free path is determined by the density of gas. When the electron beam is on, the gas might expand, leading to lower density and longer mean free path. But why would the gas expand? Because it's heated? But the temperature is the same.

Alternatively, if the gas is ionized, it might behave differently, but again, the temperature is same.

I think this is taking too long. I'll try to make an educated guess.

Given that the presence of the electron beam could cause gas to be removed, leading to lower pressure and longer mean free path, the mean free path increases. So λ2>λ1.

The options are A and D.

But without knowing by how much, perhaps the correct answer is A, but I'm not confident.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is C, but I think that's less likely.

Wait, the mean free path may not change because the vacuum is already ultra-high. So perhaps the presence of the beam doesn't change the mean free path, which would make λ2=λ1, option B. But the question says he noticed a change.

So option B is incorrect.

Thus, the conclusion is λ2>λ1.

So the options are A or D.

But without knowing the exact factor, perhaps the best option is that λ2 is larger than λ1, so the correct answer is A.

Wait, the options are A) λ2 >= 1.22*λ1 and D) λ1 < λ2 <1.22*λ1.

If the electron beam causes a significant drop in pressure, λ2 could be much larger than λ1, perhaps more than 1.22 times.

Alternatively, if the pressure only drops slightly, λ2 would be between λ1 and 1.22 times.

But without knowing, perhaps the correct answer is A.

But I'm really not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is C.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. The mean free path of the gas depends on the gas density. If the electron beam causes gas to be removed, the density decreases, so mean free path increases.

Thus, λ2>λ1.

But without knowing the factor, the only options are A and D.

But looking at the answer options, perhaps the correct answer is C) λ2 < λ1.

Wait, no, that would require the pressure to increase, which doesn't make sense.

Wait, another approach: The initial mean free path λ1 is determined under ultra-high vacuum. When the electron beam is on, the vacuum might not be as good, but the question says the temperature remains same.

Alternatively, perhaps the presence of the electron beam doesn't affect the gas's mean free path, so λ2=λ1. But the question says he found λ2, so that's not the case.

I'm stuck. I think I'll go with option C, but I'm not confident.

Wait, the mean free path could be shorter because the gas molecules are more active, leading to more collisions. So λ2 < λ1.

But I'm not sure. Maybe the correct answer is C.

Alternatively, I think the correct answer is C. Because the electron beam can cause gas molecules to be more likely to collide, so their mean free path is shorter.

But I'm not confident, and I think I'm contradicting my earlier thoughts.

In conclusion, I think the correct answer is C) λ2 < λ1.


The question revolves around the mean free path (λ) of gas molecules in an ultra-high vacuum (UHV) chamber under two conditions: when the electron beam is off (λ₁) and when it is on (λ₂). The scenario describes that Mike accurately determined λ₁ under UHV conditions but observed a change in λ when the electron beam was activated, despite the temperature remaining constant.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Mean Free Path Basics**:  
   The mean free path λ is inversely proportional to the number density \( n \) of gas molecules and depends on the collision diameter \( d \). Mathematically, \( \lambda = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2} n \pi d^2} \). Since \( n \) is proportional to pressure \( P \), λ is inversely proportional to \( P \). Lower pressure increases λ, while higher pressure decreases λ.

2. **Effect of the Electron Beam**:  
   When the electron beam is activated, several possibilities arise:
   - The beam could ionize gas molecules, making them more likely to stick to chamber walls or be pumped away, effectively reducing the number density \( n \). This would increase λ, making \( \lambda_2 > \lambda_1 \).
   - Alternatively, ionization could increase the effective collision diameter \( d \), leading to more frequent collisions and a shorter mean free path (\( \lambda_2 < \lambda_1 \)).

3. **Temperature Consideration**:  
   The temperature remains constant, so changes in molecular velocity or thermal motion are not factors. The observed change in λ must be due to changes in \( n \) or \( d \).

4. **Critical Evaluation of Options**:  
   - **Option A (\( \lambda_2 \geq 1.22 \lambda_1 \))**: This implies a significant increase in λ, which would occur if the electron beam caused a substantial reduction in \( n \) (e.g., through efficient pumping of ionized gas). However, the factor of 1.22 is not explicitly justified in the scenario.
   - **Option B (\( \lambda_2 = \lambda_1 \))**: This would mean no change in λ, contradicting the question's statement that Mike observed a change in λ. Thus, this option is incorrect.
   - **Option C (\( \lambda_2 < \lambda_1 \))**: This implies that the mean free path decreases, which could happen if the electron beam caused gas molecules to collide more frequently (e.g., through increased ionization or altered collision dynamics). However, this is less consistent with the expectation that the beam would reduce gas density.
   - **Option D (\( \lambda_1 < \lambda_2 < 1.22 \lambda_1 \))**: This suggests a moderate increase in λ, which could occur if the electron beam caused a partial reduction in \( n \), but not enough to reach 1.22 times λ₁.

5. **Conclusion**:  
   The most plausible explanation is that the electron beam causes gas molecules to be removed or ionized, reducing \( n \) and increasing λ. However, the question does not provide sufficient evidence to conclude that λ increases by a factor of 1.22 or more. A moderate increase (\( \lambda_1 < \lambda_2 < 1.22 \lambda_1 \)) aligns best with the scenario, as it accounts for the observed change without assuming an extreme pressure reduction.
