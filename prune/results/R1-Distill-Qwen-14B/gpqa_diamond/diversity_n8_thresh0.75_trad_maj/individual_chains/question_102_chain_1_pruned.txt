Okay, so I've got this pretty complex question about molecular biology and genetic constructs. I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to break it down step by step.

First, let me read through the question carefully. The setup is about a ligand-receptor pair expressed in neural crest cells. The main goal is to understand their developmental fate. So, the researcher created a bicistronic vector, which I remember means it has two genes (ligand and receptor) under a single promoter.

The vector setup: it's a lox-Cre vector. The ligand's ORF is at the 5' end, fused to mCherry. The receptor is at the 3' end, fused to eGFP at its C-terminus. The ligand is under the CBA promoter, and the receptor is after an IRES element. 

Wait, I think I remember that IRES elements allow for internal ribosome entry sites, which can drive the translation of a second ORF without needing a separate promoter. So here, the ligand is under the CBA promoter, and the receptor is under the control of the IRES, which is in the same transcript.

Between the ligand and mCherry, there's a stop cassette with loxP. Between the receptor and eGFP, there's a stop cassette with lox2272. I think these are different lox sites so that Cre can recombine them. So, if Cre is present, it would remove the stop cassettes, allowing the genes to be expressed.

They transfected primary astrocyte cultures with this plasmid and used antibodies against the overexpressed proteins. They ran a Western blot and saw signals proportional to actin loading. So, the expression is working in culture.

But when they made a mouse model homozygous for the construct in a wild-type background and crossed it to SOX10-Cre mice, they didn't see a green signal under the confocal. The green is supposed to come from eGFP, which is on the receptor.

Let me think: SOX10-Cre is a transactivator that would express Cre under the control of SOX10, which is a transcription factor important in neural crest cells. So in the offspring, the Cre should recombine the lox sites, removing the stop cassettes. That would mean that both ligand and receptor should be expressed. But in the Western blot, they saw signalsâ€”so expression is happening. But the GFP is not being detected in the mice.

Wait, but in the vector, the ligand is first (5'), followed by the stop, then the IRES, receptor, and then the stop with lox2272. So without Cre, the ligand would be expressed, but the receptor would be blocked because the stop cassette is in place. But when Cre is present (like in the SOX10-Cre mice), it should delete the loxP and lox2272 stops, allowing both ligand and receptor to be expressed.

In the Western blot, they saw signals, so both are expressed. But in the live mice, the eGFP isn't showing up. So why?

Looking at the options:

A) ligand and receptor are paracrine. Paracrine means they act on nearby cells, but that doesn't explain why the eGFP isn't being expressed. The Western blot shows it's expressed.

B) Receptor-eGFP stuck in Golgi. If the receptor wasn't properly trafficked, eGFP wouldn't be on the surface. But why would it be stuck? Maybe because of the construct design. For instance, if eGFP is fused to the C-terminus, and the receptor is properly processed, it should be on the cell surface. But if the fusion is causing issues, maybe the tag isn't working. But in the Western blot, the protein should show up regardless of trafficking.

C) Missing enhancer for expression. The CBA promoter is a strong promoter, so maybe the enhancer is needed for tissue-specific expression. But the vector is designed to express ligand and receptor in neural crest cells, using the CBA
