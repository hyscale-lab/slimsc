Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the right sequence of reactions to make 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene starting from benzene. Hmm, let me think through this step by step.

First, I should probably draw the target molecule. Let me visualize it. Benzene ring with substituents at positions 1, 2, and 3. Position 1 has ethoxy (-OEt), position 2 has tert-butyl (-C(CH3)3), and position 3 has nitro (-NO2). Wait, no, wait. The numbering might be different. Let me get that right. The name is 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene. So position 1 is ethoxy, position 2 is tert-butyl, position 3 is nitro. So the ring has substituents at 1, 2, and 3 in a meta arrangement? Or wait, no, because if it's 1, 2, and 3, that's adjacent to each other, like 1, 2, 3 are consecutive positions. So that's a vicinal arrangement. Hmmm.

Wait, benzene is a ring of six carbons. So if the substituents are at 1, 2, and 3, they're adjacent in a row. But wait, can benzene have three substituents so close? That's possible, but I need to think about the directing effects and how to get them in place.

The target molecule has substituents in positions 1, 2, and 3. So, ethoxy is at position 1, tert-butyl at 2, and nitro at 3. Alternatively, maybe I should number them differently. Wait, perhaps the numbering is such that the substituents are in the 1, 2, and 3 positions, which would mean they're adjacent. Hmm, but let me think about the synthesis.

Benzene is the starting material. I need to get these three substituents on it. Let's think about the directing effects of each group.

Ethoxy is an activating group (since it's an ether) and is a ortho/para director. Tert-butyl is a bulky group and is a strong activating, ortho/para director as well (since it's an alkyl group). Nitro groups are deactivating and
