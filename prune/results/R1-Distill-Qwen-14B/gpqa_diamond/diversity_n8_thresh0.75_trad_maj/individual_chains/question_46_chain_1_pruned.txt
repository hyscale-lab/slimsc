Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem to solve, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question says.

The question is about treating racemic 3-methylpent-1-ene with Grubbs catalyst. I need to find out how many possible products there are, excluding ethene. The options are A to D, with numbers 2, 4, 6, 8.

Hmm, what do I remember about Grubbs catalyst? Oh right, it's used in olefin metathesis reactions. Metathesis involves breaking and reforming of carbon-carbon double bonds. Grubbs catalyst is a transition metal catalyst, usually for ring-closing or ring-opening metathesis.

Wait, the starting material is racemic 3-methylpent-1-ene. The structure of that would be CH2=CH-C(CH3)-CH2-CH2? Wait, no. Let me write it down. Pent-1-ene means the double bond starts at carbon 1. So structure is CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3? No, wait, 3-methyl: the pentene is 5 carbons. So the double bond is between C1 and C2. Then the substituents on C3 would be a methyl group. So the structure is CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3? Wait, no, wait pent-1-ene would be CH2=CH-CH2-CH2-CH3? But with a methyl on C3. So it's CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3? Wait, no, that's 3-methylpent-1-ene.

Wait, wait, maybe I should draw the structure. Pentane has five carbons. Pent-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH2CH3. But 3-methyl would have a methyl branch on the third carbon. So the structure is CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3? Wait, but that's five carbons. So the chain is CH2-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3, but where is the double bond? Oh, 1-ene, so the double bond is between C1 and C2. So the structure is CH2=CH-CH(CH2CH3)-? Wait, wait no.

Wait, wait, perhaps I'm mixing up the positions. Let me structure it. 3-methylpent-1-ene. The parent chain is pent
