Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me read through the question again and jot down what I know.

The problem starts with compound A. Its proton NMR shows two signals: a triplet at 0.9 ppm for 6H and a quartet at 1.3 ppm for 4H. Hmm, I remember that in NMR, the integration gives the number of hydrogens. So 6H and 4H. The triplet and quartet might be from adjacent groups.

I think about what kind of structures give two signals. Maybe a di-substituted alkane? Like maybe two different sets of equivalent CH2 groups. Wait, a triplet and quartet could come from splitting due to neighboring groups. Let me think about possible structures.

If the triplet is for 6H, that suggests maybe two equivalent CH2 groups next to a CH2 maybe? Or perhaps a group with more hydrogens. Wait, maybe it's a di-substituted cyclopropane? No, because cyclopropane would have different coupling. Alternatively, maybe it's a structure with a central CH2 connected to two CH2 groups on each side, like in a diethyl ether or something else.

Wait, another thought: the triplet at 0.9 ppm is usually indicative of a CH2CH3 group, where the triplet comes from coupling with a neighboring CH2. So maybe a structure like (CH2CH3)2CH2? But wait, that might not fit. Let me think again.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a neopentyl group. Neopentyl is (CH2CH2)CCH3, but that might not directly fit. Wait, if I have two sets of CH2 groups. Maybe the structure is a diethyl group attached to something. Like CH2CH2CH2CH2? No, perhaps a cyclohexane derivative?

Wait, let's think about the NMR. The triplet (0.9 ppm) for 6H could be from two CH3 groups each attached to a CH2, like maybe (CH2CH3)2CH2X. But what about the quartet at 1.3 ppm for 4H? That quartet would be from a CH2 adjacent to another CH2, perhaps. So maybe the structure is something like CH2CH2CH2CH3, but that's a straight chain. Alternatively, maybe it's a cyclopropane or other ring structure.

Wait, another possibility: compound A could be 2,2-dimethylbutane. Let me think, but 2,2
