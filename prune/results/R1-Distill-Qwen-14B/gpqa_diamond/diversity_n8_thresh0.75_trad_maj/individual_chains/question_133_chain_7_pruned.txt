Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me start by reading the question carefully.

The question is about finding the concentration of orthophosphate ions in a solution. Hmm, I remember that orthophosphate is the HPO4^2- ion. The solution contains two substances: KH2PO4 and Na2HPO4·2H2O. Both are 1.00 grams each in 200 cm³ of solution. I need to calculate the concentration of orthophosphate, which I think is HPO4^2-.

Wait, but wait. I should remember the behavior of these salts in solution. Both KH2PO4 and Na2HPO4 are phosphate buffers. Because phosphate has three dissociation steps, each with different Ka values. The given Ka1, Ka2, and Ka3 are 7.5e-3, 6.2e-8, and 1.8e-12 respectively.

So, KH2PO4 is potassium hydrogen phosphate. When it dissolves, it dissociates into K+ and H2PO4^- ions. Similarly, Na2HPO4·2H2O is sodium hydrogen phosphate (I think the formula is Na2HPO4, which dissociates into 2 Na+ and HPO4^2-.

So when you mix these two, what happens? Well, H2PO4^- can act as an acid, and HPO4^2- can act as a base. They form a buffer solution. The pH of the solution will determine which form of phosphate is predominant, but since we're asked about the concentration of HPO4^2-, I think we can model this using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation.

Wait, but let's think about the possible reactions. The relevant equilibrium here is the second dissociation of
