Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. Let me try to figure it out step by step. Hmm, the question is about treating 1-bromobenzene-2-d with NaNH2 in a condensed ammonia solvent. I'm a bit rusty on my reactions, but I'll try to remember.

Wait, 1-bromobenzene-2-d... Oh right, that's o-dibromobenzene, I think. So the structure is benzene with two bromine atoms ortho to each other. Or wait, no, wait. The numbering is 1 and 2, so it's adjacent. So it's 1,2-dibromobenzene. 

And the reagent is NaNH2 in ammonia. Oh, right, that's a strong base. I remember that when aromatic compounds have halogens, sometimes elimination reactions happen. Like, perhaps a dehydrohalogenation or some kind of elimination to form a double bond or a ring expansion.

Wait, so NaNH2 is a strong base, typically used for deprotonating things. In aromatic chemistry, it's often used in the presence of a good leaving group. Wait, but in our case, the starting material is 1,2-dibromobenzene. So each Br is attached to the benzene ring.

Wait, when you have two bromine atoms on adjacent carbons, and you treat them with a strong base, what happens? I think I've heard something about forming a triple bond in such cases. Like, when two substituents are adjacent and are both leaving groups, maybe an elimination can form a triple bond.

Wait, but benzene's stability might influence the reaction. Let me think. The reaction conditions are important. Concentrated ammonia and NaNH2 are typically used for elimination reactions. For example, in the preparation of alkyne from a dihalide, like in the dehydrohalogenation of vicinal dihalides to form alkynes.

Oh wait, wait! Vicinal dihalide is two X atoms on adjacent carbons. So for benzene, if I have two Br on adjacent carbons, treating with a strong base like NaNH2 would lead to elimination of HBr twice, forming a triple bond between those two carbons.

But wait, the benzene ring is already conjugated and aromatic. How can a triple bond form between two adjacent carbons on the ring? Because in benzene, each bond is a resonance hybrid. Hmm, that's confusing.

Wait, maybe I'm mixing up concepts. Let me think again. For a normal alkyl dihalide, like 1,2-dibromoethane, when treated with strong base, it deprotonates twice and eliminates two HBr molecules to form an alkyne, like ethylene becomes acetylene.

But in the aromatic case, the substituents are on the ring. So if you have 1,2-dibromobenzene, and you remove HBr twice, would you form a triple bond in the ring? Because that would be a triple bond between two adjacent carbons in the benzene ring.

Wait, but benzene is a six-membered ring with alternating double bonds. Adding a triple bond would disrupt the aromaticity. So that's probably not possible. So what else could happen?

Alternatively, perhaps each Br leaves, and the base abstracts a proton, leading to elimination. Wait, but with two Br groups adjacent, perhaps each one can undergo elimination.

Alternatively, maybe only one elimination happens, but I'm not sure. Let me think. Let's consider each Br as a leaving group. So the first Br leaves, but where? Wait, perhaps the base deprotonates a hydrogen adjacent to Br, leading to the formation of a double bond.

Wait, each Br is on adjacent carbons. So if one Br leaves, maybe a double bond forms between the two adjacent carbons. But that would be 1,2-doubly substituted benzene. But wait, if both Brs are eliminated, perhaps the ring becomes something else.

Alternatively, maybe the dihalide undergoes elimination to form a triple bond between the two adjacent carbons, but I'm not sure if that's possible in an aromatic ring. Because benzene is aromatic and a triple bond would break conjugation. But maybe the ring can adjust, but I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps the base abstracts a hydrogen alpha to the Br, leading to the formation of a benzene ring with a double bond. Wait, but if two Brs are on adjacent carbons, eliminating one could form a double bond, but then the other Br is still present. Hmm, maybe that leads to some isomerization or further reaction.

Wait, perhaps in the first step, elimination occurs between one Br and a hydrogen, forming a double bond. Then, the other Br could also undergo elimination. But I'm not sure how that would proceed.

Wait, another possibility: in the case of 1,2-dihalobenzenes, when treated with a strong base like NaNH2, each Br can undergo elimination. So, perhaps each Br leaves, and the two adjacent positions lose HBr, forming a triple bond between them. But would that be feasible?

Wait, benzene is a six-membered ring with each carbon already bonded to two others. If two adjacent carbons form a triple bond, the ring would have a triple bond, making it a cyclohexyne. But cyclohexyne is not aromatic, but maybe it's a possibility.

Wait, but can benzene lose two HBr molecules from adjacent carbons to form a triple bond? I think that in some cases, such elimination can happen to form a triple bond. So the product would be benzene with a triple bond between two adjacent carbons, making it a cyclohexyne ring.

But wait, in that case, the structure would be a triple bond between carbons 1 and 2. But cyclohexyne is a strained molecule; maybe it's not very stable. However, under reaction conditions, perhaps it can form.

But wait, another thought: maybe the reaction doesn't form a triple bond but instead leads to the formation of a benzene ring with a substituent. Alternatively, perhaps the base deprotonates a position, leading to a more substituted structure.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps one of the Br groups is eliminated, and a hydrogen is abstracted from a neighboring position, forming a benzene ring with a double bond. But wait, 1,2-dibromobenzene would have both Brs on adjacent carbons. If one Br leaves, maybe a double bond forms between those two carbons, but where's the other Br?

Alternatively, maybe the base abstracts a hydrogen from a position adjacent to a Br, leading to the formation of a benzene ring with a double bond and a Br. But that would require only one elimination, but the other Br is still present.

Wait, perhaps the reaction isn't elimination but substitution. But NaNH2 is a strong base, more likely to cause elimination than substitution. Plus, substitution in aromatic rings usually requires something like a nitration or other such reagents, not a strong base.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is dehydrohalogenation, removing two HBr molecules to form a triple bond between carbons 1 and 2 in the benzene ring. So the product would be cyclohexyne, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the ring isn't stable after forming the triple bond, so another reaction occurs. Hmm, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach: the starting material is 1,2-dibromobenzene, and the reagent is NaNH2 in ammonia. I remember that NaNH2 can cause elimination reactions in aromatic compounds, leading to the formation of rings with triple bonds, which are called benzynes.

Wait, benzynes are highly strained and reactive, but they can form under certain conditions. So perhaps the reaction forms a benzyne intermediate.

Wait, wait, benzyne is a cyclohexatriene with a triple bond, making it a diradical or an aryne. So for benzyne formation, you typically have a dihalobenzene that loses two equivalents of HX to form a triple bond.

In this case, the dihalide is 1,2-dibromobenzene. So when treated with a strong base like NaNH2, it would eliminate two HBr molecules, forming a triple bond between carbons 1 and 2. The resulting structure would be a benzyne, specifically o-benzyne.

But wait, how many products are possible? The question is about the number of possible organic products.

Hmm, so if the reaction forms o-benzyne, which is a single product, then the answer would be 1 product. But wait, does the benzyne rearrange before forming the final product?

Wait, benzyne is a very reactive intermediate. Once formed, it can undergo various reactions, like trapping with other reagents. But in this problem, the solvent is condensed ammonia, and the reagent is NaNH2, which is a strong base. So perhaps the benzyne doesn't get a chance to react further.

But wait, wait. The question is about the products formed from this reaction. If the reaction stops at the benzyne stage, then the product is o-benzyne, which is a single product. So the answer would be 1.

Alternatively, maybe the benzyne can undergo some ring-opening or other reactions to form different products.

Wait, but under the given conditions, is the benzyne allowed to do anything else, or is it just formed and considered a product?

Hmm, I think the question is simply about the elimination reaction, so the product would be the benzyne, which is a single product. Thus, the number of possible products is 1.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction can form more than one product. Wait, could the elimination happen in different positions? No, because the starting material is fixed as 1,2-dibromobenzene, so elimination can only happen between C1 and C2.

Wait, but wait. Another possibility: when the benzyne is formed, could it undergo some kind of ring-opening or other reactions in the same conditions, leading to different products?

But without any trapping reagents, the benzyne would just be formed. So the major product would be the benzyne. So the number of products is 1.

Wait, but another angle: perhaps the initial dihalide could undergo different elimination pathways. Let me think about the structure. 1,2-dibromobenzene has two Brs on adjacent positions. When NaNH2 is added, the base could abstract a β-hydrogen, leading to the formation of a double bond. But wait, benzene is already conjugated. So if two Brs are adjacent, perhaps each Br can lose HBr, leading to a triple bond.

Wait, but the elimination would require removing two HBr molecules, so both Brs are eliminated, and a triple bond forms. So the product is a single benzyne isomer.

So in this case, only one product is formed. So the answer is B) 1.


The reaction involves treating 1,2-dibromobenzene (o-dibromobenzene) with NaNH₂ in a condensed ammonia solvent. NaNH₂ is a strong base, and in such conditions, elimination reactions are favored. The starting material, 1,2-dibromobenzene, has two bromine atoms on adjacent carbons of the benzene ring. 

When treated with NaNH₂, the strong base abstracts β-hydrogens adjacent to the bromine atoms, leading to the elimination of two equivalents of HBr. This elimination results in the formation of a triple bond between the two adjacent carbons, producing a benzyne intermediate. Specifically, the product is o-benzyne, a highly strained and reactive intermediate with a triple bond between carbons 1 and 2 of the benzene ring.

Since the starting material is fixed as 1,2-dibromobenzene, the elimination can only occur between the two adjacent bromine atoms, leading to a single product, o-benzyne. There are no additional pathways or rearrangements under the given reaction conditions that would produce multiple products. Therefore, the number of possible organic products is 1.

Answer: B
