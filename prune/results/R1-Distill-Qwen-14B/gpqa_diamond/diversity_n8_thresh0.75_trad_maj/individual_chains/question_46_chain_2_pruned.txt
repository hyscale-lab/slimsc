Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here about Grubbs catalyst and a racemic compound. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my organometallic reactions, but let's see if I can work this out.

The question says that racemic 3-methylpent-1-ene is treated with Grubbs catalyst. And I need to find how many possible products there are, excluding ethene. The options are A to D.

First, I should recall what Grubbs catalyst does. Oh right, Grubbs is a ruthenium-based catalyst used in olefin metathesis reactions. Metathesis is when you break and reform carbon-carbon double bonds, right? It's like swapping the ends of the alkenes.

The starting material is 3-methylpent-1-ene. Let me visualize that structure. Pent-1-ene means the double bond is between C1 and C2. So the structure is CH2=CHCH(CH2CH3)2? Wait, no. Wait, wait. Let me draw it more accurately.

Wait, pent-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH2CH3. But in this case, it's 3-methylpent-1-ene. So the structure is CH2=CHCH(CH3)CH2? Wait, no, that can't be right. Let me think again. Pentane has five carbons. So pent-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH2CH3. The 3-methyl would be on the third carbon. So the structure is CH2=CH-C(CH3)-CH2CH3? Wait, wait, that doesn't add up. Wait, wait, let me number the carbons.

1   2   3   4   5
CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2CH3? Wait, no, wait. Wait, pent means five carbons. So 1,2 double bond, and a methyl group on carbon 3. So the structure is CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2CH3? Wait, that would make it 3-methylpent-1-ene.

Wait, but wait, the formula for pentene is C5H10. 3-methylpent-1-ene would have the structure CH2=CHCH(CH3)2? No, because that would be more than five carbons. Wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me write it properly.

3-methylpent-1-ene: the parent chain is pent-1-ene, so five carbons in a row
