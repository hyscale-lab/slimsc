Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Hmm, let me try to think through it. Alright, the question involves wave functions and normalization because they're asking for the value of 'a'. 

Wait, the wave function is given as (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i. Oh wait, no, that can't be right. Because the wave function for a particle is usually a complex function, but in this case, maybe it's written as a real part and an imaginary part. So maybe the wave function is ψ(x) = [a / sqrt(1 + x)] - 0.5i? Or is it a product or something else? Wait, the way it's written, perhaps it's a/(sqrt(1+x)) multiplied by (1 - 0.5i), but I'm not sure. The way the question is written is a bit confusing. Oh wait, the notation says ( a / sqrt(1 + x) ) - 0.5*i. So it's a function that's a real part plus an imaginary part. But in quantum mechanics, the wave function is a complex function, so maybe the real part is a/(sqrt(1+x)) and the imaginary part is -0.5?

But wait, that can't be right because the wave function should be a function that its square modulus gives the probability density. Oh wait, no, wait: the wave function ψ is a complex function. The probability density is |ψ|². So if ψ(x) = (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i, then the modulus squared would be [a²/(1+x)] + (0.5)^2, right? Because (A + Bi)(A* - Bi*) = A² + B² when A and B are real. Wait, ψ is [a/sqrt(1+x)] (the real part) and -0.5 (the imaginary part). So ψ = (a)/(sqrt(1+x)) + (-0.5)i.

So, |ψ(x)|² = [a/(sqrt(1+x))]^2 + (0.5)^2. So that's (a²)/(1+x) + 0.25. 

Wait, but the way the wave function is written is a bit confusing. Let me make sure I'm interpreting it correctly. The question says the wave function is (a/sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i. So that would be a real number (a/sqrt(1+x)) minus 0.5 times the imaginary unit. So ψ(x) = [a/sqrt(1+x)] + (-0.5)i.

So the modulus squared is [a²/(1+x)] + (0.5)^2.

But wait, why would the wave function have a constant imaginary part? That seems odd. Normally, the wave function would have a varying real and imaginary part depending on x, but maybe in this case, the imaginary part is a constant, which is possible. I guess it's possible, but I'm not sure. But let's proceed.

The next part says that when they measured the position of the particles, none were found at x < 1 or x >3. So the particle is confined between x=1 and x=3. So the wave function is zero outside this region. Or wait, the wave function is given only for this region, perhaps. So the wave function exists only between x=1 and x=3, and it's zero elsewhere. But the given ψ(x) is (a/sqrt(1+x)) -0.5i. Wait, but if x is between 1 and 3, then 1+x is between 2 and 4. So sqrt(1+x) is between sqrt(2) and 2. So ψ is only non-zero between x=1 and 3. 

But for the wave function to be normalizable, the integral of |ψ|^2 from 1 to 3 must equal 1. Because the total probability must be 1. So we need to compute the integral from x=1 to x=3 of |ψ(x)|² dx equals 1.

So, |ψ(x)|² is [a²/(1+x)] + 0.25.

So the integral from 1 to 3 of [a²/(1+x) + 0.25] dx = 1.

Let me compute this integral. Split it into two terms:

Integral [a²/(1+x)] dx + Integral [0.25] dx, both from 1 to 3.

The first integral: a² * ln(1+x) evaluated from 1 to3.

So from 1 to3, ln(4) - ln(2) = ln(4/2) = ln(2).

So first term is a² * ln(2).

Second integral: 0.25*(3-1) = 0.25 *2 = 0.5.

So total integral is a² ln(2) + 0.5 = 1.

So a² ln(2) = 0.5.

Thus, a² = 0.5 / ln(2).

Compute ln(2) is approximately 0.6931.

So a² = 0.5 / 0.6931 ≈ 0.7213.

Then a = sqrt(0.7213) ≈ 0.849.

Looking at the options, option B is 0.85, which is very close.

Wait, let me check the calculations again to be sure.

Wait, the integral of a/(sqrt(1+x)) is a * 2 sqrt(1+x). Wait, wait, hold on. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Because I thought ψ is a/(sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i, so its modulus squared would be [a^2/(1+x)] + (0.5)^2. So the integral is [a²/(1+x) + 0.25] dx from 1 to 3.

Wait, that's correct. So integrating a²/(1+x) from 1 to3 gives a² [ln(4) - ln(2)] = a² ln(2).

The integral of 0.25 from 1 to3 is 0.25*(2) = 0.5.

So equation: a² ln(2) + 0.5 =1.

So a² ln(2) = 0.5.

a² = 0.5 / ln 2 ≈ 0.5 / 0.6931 ≈ 0.7213.

So a ≈ sqrt(0.7213) ≈ 0.849, which is approximately 0.85, which is option B.

Wait, but why is the wave function given as (a/sqrt(1+x)) -0.5i? Because if the wave function is being normalized, wouldn't the imaginary part cause the probability density to have an extra term? Let me think again. Oh wait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the modulus squared. Because ψ has a real part and an imaginary part, so |ψ|² is (real part)^2 + (imaginary part)^2. So yes, [a/(sqrt(1+x))]^2 + (0.5)^2. So that part is correct.

Wait, but another thing: sometimes wave functions are written in the form ψ(x) = R(x) e^{iθ(x)}, but in this case, it's written as real plus imaginary. But regardless, the modulus squared is the sum of squares as I did.

So the calculation seems correct. So the answer should be option B) 0.85.


The problem involves determining the value of "a" in the wave function of a particle confined between \(x = 1\) and \(x = 3\). The wave function is given as:

\[
\psi(x) = \frac{a}{\sqrt{1+x}} - 0.5i
\]

The wave function is complex, with a real part \(\frac{a}{\sqrt{1+x}}\) and an imaginary part \(-0.5\). The probability density is proportional to \(|\psi(x)|^2\), which is:

\[
|\psi(x)|^2 = \left(\frac{a}{\sqrt{1+x}}\right)^2 + (-0.5)^2 = \frac{a^2}{1+x} + 0.25
\]

Since the particle is confined between \(x = 1\) and \(x = 3\), the wave function is zero outside this region. To normalize the wave function, the integral of \(|\psi(x)|^2\) over this interval must equal 1:

\[
\int_1^3 \left(\frac{a^2}{1+x} + 0.25\right) dx = 1
\]

This integral can be split into two parts:

1. \(\int_1^3 \frac{a^2}{1+x} dx\):  
   This evaluates to \(a^2 \ln(1+x)\) from \(x = 1\) to \(x = 3\), which simplifies to \(a^2 \ln(2)\).

2. \(\int_1^3 0.25 dx\):  
   This evaluates to \(0.25 \times (3 - 1) = 0.5\).

Adding these results gives:

\[
a^2 \ln(2) + 0.5 = 1
\]

Solving for \(a^2\):

\[
a^2 \ln(2) = 0.5 \quad \Rightarrow \quad a^2 = \frac{0.5}{\ln(2)}
\]

Using \(\ln(2) \approx 0.6931\):

\[
a^2 \approx \frac{0.5}{0.6931} \approx 0.7213 \quad \Rightarrow \quad a \approx \sqrt{0.7213} \approx 0.849
\]

The closest option to this value is \(0.85\), which corresponds to option **B**.

Answer: B
