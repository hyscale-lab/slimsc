Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because relativity isn't my strongest suit, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The problem says there are two astronauts with masses 2m and 3m. They're moving at relativistic speeds: 0.6c and 0.5c respectively, both in the positive x-direction. The question is about finding two things: the relative speed between them and the total energy of the system.

Hmm, right. So for the relative speed part, I remember that when objects are moving at speeds close to the speed of light, you can't just subtract their velocities like you would in classical mechanics. Instead, you have to use the relativistic velocity addition formula. Wait, the formula is something like (v1 - v2)/(1 - (v1*v2)/c²), but wait, wait—wait, no, that's when you're finding the velocity of one frame relative to another. But in this case, the two astronauts are moving in the same direction. So to find the relative speed of one from the other's frame, which one's frame are we considering?

Wait, I think the relative speed is the speed at which one astronaut sees the other. So, for example, if astronaut A is moving at 0.6c, and astronaut B is moving at 0.5c, then from A's perspective, B is moving at (0.6c - 0.5c) = 0.1c. But wait, that's the classical approach. But relativity doesn't allow speeds to just add like that because of the speed limit c. So I need to use the relativistic formula for this.

Wait, no. The formula for relative velocity when two objects are moving in the same direction is (v1 - v2) / (1 - (v1*v2)/(c²)). So let me plug in the numbers. What's v1 and v2 here? Let me think. Let's say v1 is 0.6c, and v2 is 0.5c. So their relative speed would be (0.6c - 0.5c)/(1 - (0.6c * 0.5c)/(c²)).

Let me compute the numerator and denominator. Numerator: 0.1c. Denominator: 1 - (0.3c²)/(c²) → 1 - 0.3 = 0.7. So the relative speed is (0.1c)/
