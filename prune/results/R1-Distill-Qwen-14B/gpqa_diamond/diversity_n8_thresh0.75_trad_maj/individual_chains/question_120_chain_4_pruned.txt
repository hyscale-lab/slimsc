Okay, so I've got this question about stars and their distribution in the sky. Hmm, let me think. The question says that stars are uniformly distributed, which I think means that their density is the same throughout space. So, the number of stars doesn't get sparser as you go further out, or maybe it does? Wait, no, uniform distribution typically implies the same density everywhere. But wait, parallax is related to distance. Right, parallax (plx) is inversely proportional to distance. So, plx = 1/distance. 

The question is about how the number of stars per unit range of parallax changes with plx. Oh, so it's asking for the relationship between the number of stars in a certain range of parallax and the parallax itself.

I remember that when it comes to distances in space, the volume of a sphere increases with the cube of the radius. So, the number of stars you can see at a certain distance depends on the volume. But wait, since the density is uniform, the number of stars in a volume would be density multiplied by that volume. 

Let me think in terms of parallax. Parallax p is 1/d, where d is distance. So, if I have a small range of parallax, say from p to p + dp, what does that correspond to
