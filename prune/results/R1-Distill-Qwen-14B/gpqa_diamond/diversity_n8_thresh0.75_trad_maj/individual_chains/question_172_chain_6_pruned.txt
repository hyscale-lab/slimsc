Okay, so I have this question about stars and their effective temperatures based on the excitation of iron atoms in their photospheres. Hmm, I remember that when stars are in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE), the distribution of atoms in different energy levels can be explained using the Boltzmann equation. 

The question states that the iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to those in star_2. The energy difference between the two levels is given as 1.38e-23 J. I need to find the correct equation relating the effective temperatures T1 and T2 of the two stars.

Wait, the Boltzmann distribution equation relates the number of particles in two energy levels. The ratio of the populations is given by exp(-ΔE/(k*T)), where ΔE is the energy difference and k is the Boltzmann constant. So, for two stars, the ratio would be different based on their temperatures.

Let me think. The ratio of the excited atoms in star_1 to star_2 is 2. So, N1/N2 = 2. Using the Boltzmann equation, N1/N2 = exp(-ΔE/(k*T1)) / exp(-ΔE/(k*T2)).

Simplifying that, N1/N2 = exp(ΔE/(k) (1/T2 - 1/T1) ). Wait, wait, let me double-check. Because exp(a)/exp(b) is exp(a-b). So, the expression becomes exp( ( -ΔE/(k T1) ) - ( -ΔE/(k T2) )) ) = exp( ΔE/(k) (1/(T2) - 1/(T1)) ).

Wait, actually, I think I made a mistake in the sign. Let me correct that. The energy level is higher for the excited state. So, the Boltzmann factor for a higher energy level would be lower if the temperature is lower. So, the formula is N_upper/N_lower = exp( -ΔE/(k T) ), where ΔE is the energy difference between the upper and lower levels.

Wait, no. Let me get this right. The Boltzmann factor for a state with energy E is proportional to exp(-E/(k T)). So, the ratio of N_upper to N_lower is exp( -(E_upper - E_lower)/(k T) ), which is exp( -ΔE/(k T) ), where ΔE is E_upper - E_lower.

So in this case, for star 1, the ratio N1_upper / N1_lower = exp( -ΔE/(k T1) ), and for star 2, it's N2_upper / N2_lower = exp( -ΔE/(k T2) ). 

But the question says that in star_1, the excited level is twice as populated as in star_2. Wait, no, the question says that the iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited. Hmm, so perhaps the ratio N1/N2 is 2. If N refers to the excited state, then N1 = 2 N2.

Wait, but N1_upper / N1_lower = exp(-ΔE/(k T1)), and N2_upper / N2_lower = exp(-ΔE/(k T2)).

But the question says that in star_1, the excited level is twice as much as in star_2. So perhaps the ratio N1_upper / N2_upper = 2.

Wait,
