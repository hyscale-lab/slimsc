Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. The question is about the high-yield synthesis of a specific benzene derivative, and I need to choose the correct sequence of reactions from the given options. Let me see.

The target molecule is 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene. Hmm, I'll need to break that down. Let's draw the structure mentally. Benzene ring with substituents at positions 1, 2, and 3. Position 1 has an ethoxy group (OCH2CH3), position 2 has a tert-butyl group (C(CH3)3), and position 3 has a nitro group (NO2).

Wait, wait. Wait, in benzene numbering, the substituents are numbered in a way that the lowest possible numbers are used. So if substituents are at positions 1, 2, and 3, that's a 1,2,3-trisubstituted benzene. But the target is 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene. So the substituents are at positions 1 (ethoxy), 2 (tert-butyl), and 3 (nitro). So the numbering is 1, 2, 3 in a way that gives the lowest numbers.

So the target molecule has three substituents on the benzene ring. I need to think about the order in which these groups are introduced because the directing effects of each substituent will influence where the next substituent is added.

Let me recall the directing effects. Benzene undergoes electrophilic substitution. Nitro groups are meta directors. Ethoxy groups (OCH2CH3) are ortho/para directors. Tert-butyl groups are also para directors because they're bulky and electron-donating via the +I effect.

Wait, wait. Wait, the substituents can direct incoming electrophiles to specific positions. The question is about synthesizing the target molecule, so I need to plan the order of adding these groups.

But wait, the target has three substituents. So maybe the synthesis involves adding these groups in a particular order, taking into account their directing effects.

Let me think: which substituents are easier to introduce first? Typically, the first substituent is added to benzene, and then subsequent substituents are added based on the directing effects of the existing groups.

But wait, the target has a nitro group and an ethoxy group, which are both strong directors. Nitro is meta, ethoxy is ortho/para. The tert-butyl is a bulky group, so perhaps it's added later, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the synthesis steps involve some functional group transformations. For example, introducing a nitro group first, then ethoxy, then tert-butyl, but I'm not sure. Or perhaps some groups are introduced via different mechanisms, like Friedel-Crafts.

Wait, looking at the options, the reactions include nitration, sulfonation, alkylation (Friedel-Crafts?), nitroso reactions, diazotization, hydrolysis, and others.

So let's think about how each substituent is added.

First, perhaps the ethoxy group could be introduced via a nucleophilic aromatic substitution, but that's usually tricky unless the ring is
