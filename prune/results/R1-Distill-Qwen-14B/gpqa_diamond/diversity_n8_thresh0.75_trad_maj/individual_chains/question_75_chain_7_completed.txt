Okay, so I've got this question about molecular biology and genetics. Let me try to think through it step by step. 

The question is about a researcher trying to create a transgenic mouse model to study the GADD45G protein's role in SARS-CoV-2 infection. They're using a plasmid to overexpress the protein with an added HA tag. But when they try to express it, it doesn't work. They checked the plasmid sequence and found this long plus strand sequence. 

The options given are A to D. I need to figure out why the protein isn't being overexpressed.

First, let me understand what each part of the process is. The researcher introduced a HA tag at the N-terminus of GADD45G. HA tags are usually short peptide sequences added to proteins for detection and purification. So they modified the coding sequence by inserting the HA sequence before the start codon.

Wait, N-terminus is the beginning of the protein. So the HA would be added before the start, meaning the start codon (ATG) comes after the HA sequence. But wait, the start codon is still the same, so the reading frame should be correct.

They transfected the plasmid into CHO cells using Lipofectamine. Then selected resistant colonies and tested expression. But no overexpression. So the problem is likely in the construct.

Looking at the sequence provided, let's analyze it. The plus strand's sequence starts with ATG, which is the start codon. Wait, but wait—the HA tag is supposed to be at the N-terminus, so the sequence should include the HA coding before the ATG. But the given sequence starts with ATG. Hmm, maybe I'm misunderstanding.

Wait, look at the sequence: it starts with 5' ATG TAC CCA TAC GAT G... Oh wait, that's the start. So the HA tag would have to be before the ATG? Or is it part of the coding sequence before the ATG?

Wait, the HA tag is a short peptide. Its coding sequence would be before the start codon. So the HA coding would come before the ATG. But in the given sequence, the plus strand starts with ATG, which suggests the HA tag isn't present in the construct because the start is right at the beginning.

Wait, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Let me think again. The coding sequence is modified by adding the HA sequence. So the construct should have the HA coding before the ATG start codon. But in the given sequence, the first nucleotides are ATG, which is the start codon. So that suggests that the HA hasn't been added correctly. Because if it was added, the sequence after the HA would be the ATG, meaning the HA is upstream.

Alternatively, perhaps the HA is introduced within the coding sequence without a proper start. Wait, maybe the HA is inserted but in a way that disrupts the reading frame or creates a premature stop codon.

Alternatively, perhaps the HA insertion caused a frameshift. Let's see. The HA is a short peptide. Let me think about the coding sequence.

Alternatively, perhaps the HA was added but the construct is missing a Kozak sequence or proper ribosome binding site, leading to translation issues. But the question doesn't mention anything about that; it just says they added the HA at the N-terminus.

Wait, another thought: maybe the HA was inserted in the wrong reading frame. Let's see. Let me look at the given plus strand sequence.

The first part is ATG TAC CCA TAC GAT G... So ATG is methionine, TAC is tyrosine, CCA is proline, TAC is tyrosine again, GAT is aspartate, G is glycine. Wait, that's the beginning of the GADD45G sequence without the HA tag. Because the HA should be added before the ATG.

Wait, but the given sequence starts with ATG, which is the start codon. So the HA hasn't been added. Because if they added it, the sequence before the ATG would be the HA coding. So perhaps the construct was not correctly modified—it doesn't have the HA sequence. But the question says they introduced the HA. Wait, perhaps the problem is that the HA was added in a way that wasn't correctly incorporated. Or perhaps the HA is in the wrong place.

Wait, but the options don't mention anything about the HA being missing. Let me look at the options again.

Option A) The sequence for the antigenic determinant has a missense mutation. So it's a mutation in the HA sequence. But the given sequence starts with ATG, which is the start of the GADD45G. So perhaps the HA was not properly added. If the HA wasn't added, then the GADD45G is expressed. But the problem is that the construct is not working.

Wait, but the problem is that the protein isn't being overexpressed. So maybe the construct is not correct. Let's see the given sequence: the construct starts with ATG, which is the start codon for GADD45G. But if the HA was added before, the sequence should start with the HA's coding followed by ATG. So in the given sequence, the HA isn't present. That suggests that the HA wasn't inserted correctly. But the question says that they introduced the HA sequence—so perhaps the plasmid was not correctly modified. But the problem is not about the HA being in the construct, but why the protein isn't expressed.

Wait, but perhaps the HA insertion caused a frameshift. Let me think, for example, if the HA is a short tag, maybe it's 8 amino acids, which is 24 nucleotides. If they inserted 24 nucleotides before the ATG, that would be in frame. But if they inserted a different number, that would cause a frameshift.

Looking at the given sequence, perhaps the construct was not modified correctly. Let me look for the start codon. The given sequence starts with ATG, followed by TAC, etc. So the start is correct.

Wait, but perhaps the issue is that the HA was added in the wrong reading frame. Let's say the HA is inserted as an addition to the N-terminus, but without maintaining the frame. So the ATG is in a different frame, leading to a frameshift and a premature stop codon.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the HA is added, but the construct has a premature stop codon.

Alternatively, perhaps the HA insertion caused a premature stop codon, leading to the protein being truncated and maybe recognized for degradation.

Another possibility is that the construct lacks a termination codon. But the given sequence ends with ...GAGTGA. Let's see, at the end: ...GAG TGA. GAG is Glu, TGA is a stop codon. So the sequence ends with TGA, which is a stop codon. So the protein ends there.

Wait, but perhaps the issue is that the HA tag itself contains a stop codon in the same frame, which would cause the protein to be truncated.

Wait, HA is a short peptide. Let me think about its codon sequence. HA is typically a peptide sequence, so the DNA coding for it would be something like ATTCGCGGCCGC, but I'm not exactly sure. Let's say the HA is, for example, 8 amino acids. The coding sequence would be 24 nucleotides. If they inserted that correctly before the ATG, the reading frame would be correct. But if they inserted it without considering the frame, the ATG would be in a different frame, leading to a frameshift.

Wait, but the given sequence starts with ATG, which suggests that the HA was not inserted. So perhaps the construct didn't include the HA, but the problem is that the HA was supposed to be there. But why would that cause a problem in expression?

Alternatively, perhaps the HA was inserted in a way that introduced a stop codon. Let's think: suppose the HA's coding sequence includes a TAA, TAG, or TGA codon in frame. That would cause the ribosome to stop early, leading to a truncated protein. Or perhaps the HA's sequence is in the opposite frame, but that's less likely.

Wait, perhaps the HA was added, but the construct has a stop codon in the same frame as the HA, causing the protein to terminate early.

But in the given sequence, the first codon is ATG (start), then TAC (tyr), etc. So no stop codon early on. So that's not the issue.

Wait, perhaps the HA was added in a way that created a stop codon. Let me think, if the HA's coding was inserted in frame but includes a stop codon, then the GADD45G would be expressed as a shorter protein. But in the given sequence, the start is correct, and the stop is at the end. So perhaps that's not the issue.

Wait, another possibility: the construct lacks a proper ribosome binding site (RBS). But the question doesn't mention that. The plasmid was transfected into CHO cells, which have their own RBS? Or maybe the construct includes a RBS. But if the RBS is missing, the ribosome can't initiate translation. But the given sequence shows that it starts with ATG, which is the start codon. So perhaps the RBS is missing. But that's not one of the options.

Looking at the options again:

Option A: Missense mutation in the HA. But if the HA isn't present in the sequence, this wouldn't apply.

Option B: The ribosome terminated early. That would imply a stop codon in the construct. But the given sequence ends with TGA, which is a stop. But that's at the end. If the ribosome is terminating early, perhaps a stop codon appears earlier. Let me check the sequence.

Let me go through the given sequence and look for any TAA, TAG, or TGA codons before the end.

The sequence is quite long, but let's scan for the stop codons.

Looking for TGA: I see TGA appears at the end, but perhaps earlier?

Wait, let me parse the sequence:

Looking for TGA in the sequence.

Wait, I'm getting a bit lost in this long sequence. Let me look for the stop codon TGA.

Looking through the sequence, I see towards the end: CTGCTGCGAGAACGACATCGACATAGTGCGCGTGGGCGATGTGCAGCGGCTGGCGGCTATCGTGGGCGCCGGCGAGGAGGCGGGTGCGCCGGGCGACCTGCACTGCATCCTCATTTCGAACCCCAACGAGGACGCCTGGAAGGATCCCGCCTTGGAGAAGCTCAGCCTGTTTTGCGAGGAGAGCCGCAGCGTTAACGACTGGGTGCCCAGCATCACCCTCCCCGAGTGA3'

Breaking it down:

... GAG TGA.

So, the last codon is TGA, which is a stop. So the sequence doesn't have a premature stop codon until the end. So that's not the issue.

Wait, but the construct starts with ATG and ends with TGA, which is correct. So the protein should be expressed fine. But the problem is that it's not overexpressed.

Wait, but the initial step was to add the HA tag. Did they add it correctly? The given sequence starts with ATG, which is the start of the GADD45G. So the HA wasn't added before the ATG. That suggests that the construct doesn't have the HA. But the question says that they did introduce the HA sequence. So perhaps the plasmid wasn't correctly modified, and the HA wasn't inserted. But the problem here is that the protein isn't expressed. Why?

If the HA was inserted after the ATG, that would add amino acids to the N-terminus, but in that case, the start codon is correct. Alternatively, perhaps the HA was inserted in a way that causes a frameshift. For example, if the HA is 24 nucleotides (8 codons), inserted after the ATG. But if the number of nucleotides is not a multiple of three, it would cause a frameshift.

Wait, the HA sequence is probably about 8 amino acids, which is 24 nucleotides. So adding 24 nucleotides in frame wouldn't cause a frameshift. But if something went wrong and the number was different, like 25, then a frameshift occurs.

Another possibility is that the HA was inserted in the wrong orientation. If the HA was inserted in reverse complement, the reading frame would be wrong.

Wait, but let's think about the construct. The HA is added at the N-terminus, so its coding sequence should be in the same direction as the GADD45G. So the HA sequence would be before the ATG. But in the given sequence, the ATG is the first codon. So the HA isn't present. So the construct is wild-type, without the HA tag. So why isn't the protein overexpressed?

Wait, the construct was supposed to be for inducible overexpression of GADD45G with HA. But when they tested, the protein isn't overexpressed. So perhaps the plasmid wasn't correctly modified. But the question states that the given sequence is the plus strand of the construct. So the construct is correct in that the HA wasn't added. But the researcher intended to add it. So perhaps the HA wasn't inserted, but that's not the issue given the options.

Wait, looking at the options again:

Option C) The lack of the linker sequence is triggering proteolysis of the nascent chain.

Hmm. Linker sequences are often added between the tag and the protein to prevent proteolysis. If the HA is directly fused to the protein without a linker, proteases might cleave at the HA site, leading to degradation. But wait, the given sequence doesn't have the HA. So perhaps the construct lacks the HA, so the protein isn't being tagged, but why isn't it expressed?

Wait, perhaps the issue is that the HA wasn't included, but the construct is correct. But the researcher intended to have the HA but didn't. So the overexpression construct is just GADD45G, which should be expressed. But why isn't it?

Alternatively, perhaps the HA is present but is causing issues. For example, the antibody used to detect HA might not be working, but the question says they used it to affinity-purify the protein. So if the HA isn't there, purification wouldn't work.

But the problem here is that the protein isn't being expressed. So perhaps the construct is not being properly expressed.

Wait, perhaps the construct has an in-frame stop codon. But I don't see any in the given sequence until the end.

Another thought: perhaps the start codon is not correctly placed. For example, in the given sequence, the ATG is the first codon. But in a eukaryotic system, the ribosome requires a Kozak sequence around the start codon for efficient translation initiation.

The Kozak sequence is usually around the start codon in eukaryotes. It's a consensus sequence like 'CCACCAUGG' where the ATG is the start. The Kozak sequence helps in ribosome binding. If the construct lacks this, the ribosome might not initiate translation, leading to low expression.

Looking at the given sequence, the start is ATG. Before that, the sequence is... the beginning of the plus strand is ATG. So there's nothing before the ATG in the plus strand. Wait, no, wait—if the construct starts with ATG, perhaps the Kozak sequence is absent. So the ribosome can't find the start codon, leading to no translation.

But the options don't mention anything about the Kozak sequence. So perhaps that's not the issue.

Wait, another idea: the plus strand is the coding strand. So in the plasmid, the insert should be in the same direction as the promoter. If the insert is in the opposite direction, the ATG would not be recognized.

Wait, the plasmid has a promoter, and the insert should be cloned in the correct orientation. If the insert is in the reverse direction, the ATG would not be in frame with the promoter, leading to no expression.

But the given sequence starts with ATG, which suggests it's in the correct orientation. So that's not the problem.

Alternatively, perhaps the plasmid has a promoter that is not compatible with the construct. For example, it's a promoter that doesn't work in CHO cells. But the question doesn't provide that info.

Wait, looking at the options again. Option B says the ribosome terminated early. If the construct had a stop codon upstream, that would cause early termination. But in the given sequence, the stop is at the end.

So perhaps the HA was inserted in a way that introduced a stop codon. For example, suppose the HA sequence includes a TAA, TAG, or TGA codon in frame. Then, the GADD45G would be truncated, leading to a smaller protein. But if the HA was added correctly, the stop codon would still be at the end.

Wait, but the given sequence doesn't have the HA. So perhaps the HA wasn't added, but the construct is fine otherwise. But why isn't the protein being expressed?

Alternatively, perhaps the HA insertion caused a frameshift, leading to a stop codon somewhere else. So the sequence would have a stop codon early on. Let me consider that.

If the HA was inserted in a way that shifts the frame, the reading of the GADD45G would change, and a stop codon could appear earlier in the sequence. Let's look for any in-frame stop codons in the given sequence.

Looking at the given sequence, after ATG, the next codons are TAC (Y), CCA (P), TAC (Y), GAT (D), etc. None of these are stop codons. So perhaps the HA wasn't inserted, or the insertion was done correctly without causing a frameshift.

Wait, another possibility: the HA was inserted, but the plasmid has a mutation in the HA sequence, leading to a stop codon. For example, a point mutation in the HA that introduces a stop codon. But if the HA wasn't added, this wouldn't apply.

Alternatively, perhaps the HA wasn't added, but the construct is correct, so the protein should be expressed. But perhaps the antibiotic resistance marker is not correctly inserted, leading to failure in selecting the transfected cells. But the question says they selected the antibiotic-resistant colonies, implying that the resistance is functional.

Wait, perhaps the issue is that the HA is present but is causing the protein to be directed to the wrong cellular compartment. For instance, if the HA is part of a signal peptide, it could target the protein to the ER or another compartment, but that's probably not the case here.

Alternatively, perhaps the presence of the HA tag impairs the function of the protein, but the question is about overexpression, not functionality.

Wait, but the question states that the HA is at the N-terminus. If the HA is not present in the protein, but the construct is correct, why isn't the protein expressed?

Wait, another thought: perhaps the HA insertion caused a premature stop codon. Let me imagine that the HA is added, and perhaps the first codon after the HA is a stop. For example, the HA is added as ATTCGCGGCCGC, which is 24 nucleotides, so in frame. Then the next codon after the HA would be the start of GADD45G. But in the given sequence, the HA isn't present.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me try to think about the options again.

Option A: The HA has a missense mutation. If the HA's sequence is mutated, that would change the HA epitope, perhaps preventing detection. But the question is about expression, not detection. So even if the HA is mutated, the protein should still be expressed, just not detected. But the issue is that the protein isn't being overexpressed at all.

Option B: The ribosome terminated early. That would mean a stop codon is present before the end. But the given sequence doesn't have any stop codons until the end. So this is unlikely.

Option C: Lack of linker causing proteolysis. If the HA is directly fused without a linker, maybe the proteases cleave the protein. But again, the given sequence doesn't have the HA. So this option doesn't seem to fit.

Option D: The tRNA for UAA doesn't exist in the mouse. Wait, UAA is a stop codon. All stop codons are read by the same machinery. So this option doesn't make sense because the stop codon is part of the termination, not requiring a tRNA.

Wait, but wait, the construct ends with TGA, which is a stop codon. If the plasmid is in a mouse cell, and mouse cells have the machinery to recognize TGA as a stop. So D is about UAA, which is not in the construct.

So perhaps none of the options directly apply, but I'm probably missing something.

Wait, perhaps the HA is present, but the construct has a mutation in the start codon, leading to no initiation. For example, if the ATG was mutated to something else. But the given sequence starts with ATG, so that's not the case.

Another possibility: the presence of the HA sequence introduces a cryptic promoter or another ORF, leading to read-through or interference. But without the HA present in the sequence, this is unlikely.

Wait, perhaps the HA was inserted in the wrong orientation. For example, the HA is in the reverse complement, which would cause a frameshift. But in that case, the given sequence would start with a different codon. Since it starts with ATG, perhaps the HA wasn't inserted.

Alternatively, perhaps the HA is present but in a way that the reading frame is shifted, leading to a stop codon. But again, the given sequence doesn't show any stop codons before the end.

Wait, maybe the problem is that the HA wasn't added, so the construct is the wild-type GADD45G. But the question states that the construct was modified to add the HA. So if the HA wasn't added, the construct is the same as wild-type, and shouldn't the protein be expressed normally? Unless the wild-type gene is not expressed in the cells due to other reasons. But the question says they are trying to overexpress it, so the construct should have a promoter driving the gene.

Wait, perhaps the HA was inserted, but it's causing the ribosome to terminate early. For example, the HA sequence includes a stop codon. Let me think: if the HA's coding sequence includes a TGA, that would be a stop codon in frame. Let's say the HA is HAAG, which would be 4 amino acids. The coding sequence would be ATTC GCGG CCGC, but that's 12 nucleotides, which is 4 codons. If any of those codons is a stop, that would cause the problem.

Wait, but the HA sequence is supposed to be a short peptide. Let's say the HA is YPYDVPFD. The coding sequence would be TAC CCC TAC GAT GGT TTA CGC GAT TTA TCA GAA GAA. Wait, but that's just an example. If any of those codons is a stop, then the protein would terminate early.

But in the given sequence, the HA isn't present, so this isn't the case.

Alternatively, perhaps the HA wasn't inserted, but the construct is otherwise correct. Then why isn't the protein expressed? Because the plasmid may not have been correctly transformed into the cells. But the question states they selected antibiotic-resistant colonies, implying that the plasmid is present.

Wait, perhaps the promoter is not functional. If the promoter in the construct isn't recognized by CHO cells, the gene won't be expressed. But the question doesn't mention this, so it's probably not the intended answer.

Hmm, I'm going in circles. Let me think about the options again.

Option C: Lack of linker causing proteolysis. So, the HA is directly fused to the protein. If the HA is present, perhaps the cell's proteases cleave the protein at the HA site, leading to degradation. But the given sequence doesn't have the HA, so this option wouldn't apply.

Option B: The ribosome terminated early. If the construct had a stop codon before the end, the protein would be shorter. But the given sequence ends with TGA, so this is the correct stop. So the ribosome wouldn't terminate early.

Wait, but perhaps the construct has an internal ribosome entry site (IRES) or another element causing early termination. But that's beyond the scope of the question.

Alternatively, perhaps the plasmid is not properly replicated in the cells. But the question says they used Lipofectamine for transfection, which should work.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that the HA was added but the start codon is not in frame. So the ATG is in a different frame, leading to no expression. Let's say the HA was inserted in a way that shifted the frame. Then the ATG would be in a different reading frame, and the ribosome wouldn't start.

For example, if the HA is inserted as 25 nucleotides, which is not a multiple of three, causing a frameshift. So the ATG would be in a different frame, and the codons would be read from there, leading to a different sequence and possibly a stop codon early on.

In the given sequence, the first codon is ATG, so if the HA insertion caused a frameshift, the ATG would be in a different frame. But in the given sequence, the first codon is ATG, so that suggests that the HA wasn't inserted, and the frame is correct.

Wait, this is getting complicated. Let me think: the construct was supposed to have the HA at the N-terminus, followed by the GADD45G coding sequence. If the HA wasn't added, the construct is just GADD45G. But why isn't it expressed?

Alternatively, perhaps the plasmid has a deletion or mutation in the GADD45G coding sequence, making it nonfunctional. But the given sequence seems intact.

Wait, another angle: the HA tag is added, but the presence of the HA causes the protein to be retained in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) because it's a signal peptide. But the HA isn't a signal peptide, so that's unlikely.

Alternatively, maybe the HA is part of a ubiquitination signal, leading to protein degradation. But again, that's speculative.

Wait, perhaps the HA was inserted but in the wrong reading frame, causing a premature stop. For example, if the HA is added as 25 nucleotides, the frame shifts, and the first codon after the shift is a stop.

But in the given sequence, the HA isn't present, so that's not the case.

Hmm. I'm not making progress. Let me try to think differently. The question says the researcher added the HA at the N-terminus. The given construct's sequence starts with ATG, so the HA isn't present. So the plasmid wasn't correctly modified. But the question says they introduced the HA, so perhaps the construct they used didn't include it. But why isn't the protein expressed?

Wait, perhaps the reading frame after the HA insertion is wrong. For example, if the HA is inserted in a way that disrupts the frame, the first codon after the insertion is a stop. But without the HA, the sequence starts with ATG and continues correctly.

Wait, perhaps the issue is that the HA wasn't added, but the GADD45G has a premature stop codon. But the given sequence ends correctly with TGA.

Another thought: the HA tag might have a start codon within it, causing the ribosome to terminate early. For example, if the HA sequence includes an ATG in frame, leading the ribosome to start there and stop at the first stop codon. But without the HA, this wouldn't apply.

Wait, but the given sequence doesn't have the HA. So perhaps the problem is that the HA was not added, but the construct is the same as wild-type, and the wild-type isn't overexpressed. But why?

Alternatively, perhaps the construct lacks a poly-A tail, which is necessary for mRNA stability and translation. But the question doesn't mention that.

Wait, the given sequence is the coding strand, which is the sense strand. So the plasmid's insert is in the correct direction. So the promoter is driving the transcription of the coding strand, leading to a mRNA that is in the same direction as the ATG.

So the mRNA would be the same as the given sequence. So the ribosome should start at ATG and translate until TGA.

But if the ribosome doesn't start, perhaps the Kozak sequence is missing. But without knowing the exact sequence around the start, it's hard to say.

Wait, in the given sequence, the first codon is ATG, which is the start. But in eukaryotes, the Kozak sequence is important. Let me look at the nucleotides before the ATG.

The sequence starts with ATG, but perhaps the preceding nucleotides don't form a Kozak sequence. For example, the nucleotides before ATG are part of the plasmid's vector, maybe not the right sequence for the Kozak.

But again, none of the options mention the Kozak sequence.

Wait, perhaps the issue is that the HA was supposed to be added, but wasn't, leading to the construct being wild-type. But why isn't the wild-type being expressed? Unless the wild-type's own regulation prevents overexpression. But the construct is supposed to be inducible overexpression.

Alternatively, perhaps the HA wasn't added but the GADD45G has a mutation that causes a stop codon. But the given sequence ends with TGA, which is correct.

Hmm. I'm really stuck. Let me try to think of each option again.

Option A: HA has a missense mutation. So perhaps the HA isn't recognized by the antibody, but the protein is still expressed. But the question is about overexpression, not detection. So this might not explain the lack of expression.

Option B: Ribosome terminated early. But the given sequence doesn't have a premature stop.

Option C: Lack of linker causing proteolysis. Without a linker, maybe the HA is recognized for degradation. But again, the HA isn't present in the construct.

Option D: No tRNA for UAA. But UAA is a stop codon, so it's not read by tRNA. So this is incorrect.

Wait, wait! The question says the researcher introduced the HA sequence at the N-terminus. But if the HA is added before the ATG, then the ATG is the start of the HA. Wait, no. The HA is a protein tag, so its coding sequence comes before the ATG of the GADD45G.

So the construct should have the HA coding sequence followed by ATG GADD45G.

But in the given sequence, the first codon is ATG, which is the start of GADD45G. So the HA wasn't added. Therefore, the construct is missing the HA. But why isn't the GADD45G being expressed?

Wait, perhaps the HA was added but in a way that causes a frameshift, leading to a stop codon. Let me imagine that the HA is inserted as 25 nucleotides, which is 8 codons and one extra nucleotide. That would cause a frameshift. So the reading frame after the HA is different.

In that case, the first codon after the frameshift would be a different sequence. Let's say the HA is inserted as 25 nucleotides, so the frame shifts by +1. The first codon after the HA would be (from the original sequence):

The original sequence starts with ATG TAC CCA TAC GAT G..., so if the HA is inserted before, and the frame shifts, the first codon after the HA would be, say, TAC (tyrosine) but in a different frame. Wait, maybe leading to a stop codon early on.

But in the given sequence, the first codon is ATG, so the frame isn't shifted.

Alternatively, perhaps the HA was inserted in the wrong direction, causing the frame to shift. If the HA is in the reverse complement, the frame would be different. But the given sequence starts with ATG, which suggests the frame is correct.

I'm really not making progress here. Given the time I've spent, I think the intended answer is Option C: the lack of a linker is causing proteolysis. But I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, perhaps the HA wasn't added, and the construct is wild-type, but without the HA, the affinity purification fails, but that's not about expression levels.

Wait, another possibility: the HA sequence includes a stop codon. For example, the HA is HAAG, which is 4 amino acids. The coding sequence would be ATTC GCGG CCGC. Wait, that's 12 nucleotides, which is 4 codons. If any of those are a stop codon, then the HA would cause a premature stop. But in the given sequence, the HA isn't present. So this isn't the case.

Alternatively, perhaps the HA was inserted after the ATG, causing the HA to be part of the protein. But if the HA is inserted after the ATG, the start codon is still correct, and the HA would be added to the N-terminus. But the given sequence doesn't have the HA.

Wait, maybe the HA was inserted in the opposite frame, leading the ATG to be in a different frame, but the given sequence starts with ATG, so that's not the case.

I think I've exhausted all possibilities. Based on the options, the most plausible is option C: the lack of a linker sequence is causing proteolysis. Because without a linker, the HA might be recognized as a signal for degradation. But wait, the given sequence doesn't have the HA, so this might not be the case.

Alternatively, perhaps the HA was added, but the plasmid's selection marker is not correctly inserted, leading to cell death. But the question says they selected resistant colonies, so that's not it.

Wait, another thought: the HA might not have been correctly inserted, leading to a truncated protein. But without the HA, the construct is wild-type, which should express fine.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that the HA was added, but the start codon is not in frame, leading to no expression. For example, the HA is added in a way that the ATG is in a different frame, so the ribosome doesn't start. But the given sequence starts with ATG, which suggests the frame is correct.

I'm stuck. I think the intended answer is option C. But I'm not confident.


The question revolves around a researcher attempting to create a transgenic mouse model to study the GADD45G protein's role in SARS-CoV-2 infection. The researcher introduced an HA tag at the N-terminus of the GADD45G coding sequence to facilitate detection and purification. However, upon testing, the protein was not overexpressed. The provided sequence of the plus strand of the construct was analyzed to identify the issue.

### Key Analysis of the Options:

1. **Option A: The sequence for the antigenic determinant has a missense mutation**  
   This option suggests that the HA tag contains a mutation altering its sequence. However, the given sequence starts with `ATG`, indicating the GADD45G coding sequence begins immediately, with no evidence of the HA tag. Therefore, this option does not explain the lack of overexpression.

2. **Option B: The ribosome terminated the translation early**  
   For the ribosome to terminate early, a premature stop codon (TAA, TAG, or TGA) would need to appear upstream of the sequence's natural stop codon. The given sequence does not contain any premature stop codons; the only stop codon is at the end (`TGA`). Thus, this option is unlikely.

3. **Option C: The lack of the linker sequence is triggering proteolysis of the nascent chain**  
   If the HA tag were present, a lack of a linker sequence could lead to proteolysis, causing the protein to be degraded. However, the given sequence does not include the HA tag, making this option irrelevant to the issue at hand.

4. **Option D: The tRNA for the UAA codon does not exist in the mouse**  
   UAA is a stop codon, and all stop codons are recognized by the translation machinery without requiring specific tRNAs. Since the sequence ends with `TGA`, which is a valid stop codon, this option is incorrect.

### Conclusion:
The given sequence does not include the HA tag, suggesting that the construct was not modified correctly. However, the sequence appears intact, with no premature stop codons or other issues that would prevent translation. The most plausible explanation, based on the options provided, is **Option C**, as the lack of a linker sequence could theoretically cause proteolysis if the HA tag were present. Despite this, the absence of the HA tag in the sequence makes this explanation speculative.
