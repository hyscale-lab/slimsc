Okay, so I've got this Pinacol rearrangement problem here. I remember that the Pinacol rearrangement involves vicinal diols reacting under acidic conditions. Vicinal diols are diols where the two hydroxyl groups are on adjacent carbons. The reaction forms a carbocation intermediate, leading to a shift of a group (like in hydride or alkyl shifts) to form a ketone. 

The general idea is that when the diol is treated with acid, the two hydroxyls protonate, leading to the loss of water and the formation of a carbocation. Then, a neighboring group (like a hydrogen or an alkyl group) shifts to form a more stable carbocation. Finally, a ketone is formed from that carbocation.

So, looking at the given compounds:

1. 3-methyl-4-phenylhexane-3,4-diol reacting with H+ gives product A.
2. 3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)-2-phenylpentane-2,3-diol reacting with H+ gives product B.
3. 1,1,2-tris(4-methoxyphenyl)-2-phenylethane-1,2-diol reacting with H+ gives product C.

I need to figure out each product.

Starting with compound A: 3-methyl-4-phenylhexane-3,4-diol.

Structure: I'll try to draw it. The main chain is hexane, with hydroxyl groups on carbons 3 and 4. Carbon 3 has a methyl group, and carbon 4 has a phenyl group.

So, structure is:

CH2-CH2-C(OH)H(CH3)-C(OH)(Ph)-CH2-CH3?

Wait, no. Wait, hexane-3,4-diol. So positions 3 and 4 each have OH groups.

So, numbering from left to right: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.

So, carbon 3: OH and a methyl group as substituents. Carbon 4: OH and a phenyl group.

So when H+ is added, the two OH groups protonate. Then, each loses water, but how? Maybe the two OHs are next to each other, so when H+ is added, they can form a bridge, leading to the loss of two water molecules and a carbocation.

Alternatively, maybe the diol loses a water from each hydroxyl, leading to neighboring carbocations? Or perhaps the diol becomes a better leaving group.

Wait, in the Pinacol rearrangement, each OH is protonated to form a good leaving group (water), and then the adjacent carbons form a carbocation. The loss of water from both OHs leads to a bridged ion, which then breaks apart into two carbocations? Or perhaps forms a cyclic intermediate.

Wait, another way to think: When the diol is protonated, the adjacent OH groups can form a bridge, leading to the loss of two water molecules and the formation of a carbocation in the middle.

Wait, for example: The diol is HO-R-R-OH. Protonation leads to (HOH2+)-R-R-OH2+. Then, each OH loses a water, leading to R-R-O-OH2+? No, maybe the adjacent oxygens
