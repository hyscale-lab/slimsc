Okay, so I have this organic chemistry question about optical isomerism, and I need to figure it out. Hmm, optical isomerism is when compounds are non-superimposable mirror images of each other, which usually happens due to chiral centers. Right, so each compound here might have some chirality.

The question lists four compounds and asks which show optical isomerism. The options are A, B, C, D, each pairing some of these compounds.

Let me look at each one:

1. Dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate. Biphenyl compounds can have different isomerisms. So the structure has two benzene rings connected by a single bond. The substituents are at the 2 and 2' positions, and nitro groups at 6 and 6'. Wait, but in biphenyls, if the substituents are in positions that allow for hindered rotation, they can have cis and trans isomers. But optical isomerism (chirality) requires a chiral center though, right? Wait, unless it's a planar molecule with some kind of asymmetry. Wait, the compound has two methyl ester groups, two nitro groups. Are there any chiral centers here? Let me think: each benzene ring is attached to substituents at 2 and 2' positions. The connecting single bond between the two rings can rotate, but for biphenyls, sometimes you get atropisomerism if the rotation is hindered. But atropisomers are a type of stereoisomer but not necessarily optical isomers. Hmm, because atropisomerism arises due to restricted rotation around the central bond, making the two parts of the molecule non-superimposable. So if this compound has such a structure, maybe it can have optical isomerism. Wait, but for a molecule to be chiral, it must lack a plane of symmetry and have a chiral center or be a meso compound? Or, in the case of atropisomerism, it's about hindered rotation leading to stereoisomerism, which could be optical. So, does this compound have such a situation? The substituents are at positions that might create a chiral axis or something. Let me think: if the two benzene rings have different substituents, it might not, but in this case, the substituents are symmetrical. Wait, each ring has a nitro group and a methyl ester at certain positions. Let me try to visualize the structure: the biphenyl has a single bond. Each ring has a nitro group at 6 and 6' positions, and the ester groups at 2 and 2'. Wait, if both rings have the same substituents, then the molecule might have a plane of symmetry. So maybe it's not chiral. Hmm, not sure about this one. Maybe it doesn't have optical isomerism.

2. Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate. Let's break this down. The formula is CH3CO-OCH2CH2OH? Wait, no. Propanoate is CH2CH2COO- but the structure is methyl ester, so the parent acid is propanoic acid. So the structure would be CH3CH(OH)COOCH3. Wait, 2-hydroxypropanoate: the propanoate is CH2CH2COO-, but 2-hydroxy would be on the middle carbon. So the structure is CH3-C(OH)H-COOCH3. Wait, the molecule is CH2(OH
