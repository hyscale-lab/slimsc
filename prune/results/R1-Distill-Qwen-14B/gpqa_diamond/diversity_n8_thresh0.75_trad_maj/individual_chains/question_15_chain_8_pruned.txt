Okay, so there's this question about planet transits and which planet is more likely to transit. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

So both planets have been detected via the RV method. That means we know their minimum masses and orbital periods. Oh, wait, the question says both have the same mass. So Planet 1 and Planet 2 have equal masses. But their orbital periods are different. Planet 1 has three times shorter a period than Planet 2. So if Planet_2's period is P, Planet_1 is P/3.

Their orbits are circular, so no eccentricity issues here. The host stars have different masses but same radii. Planet_1's star is twice as massive as Planet_2's star. But both stars have the same radius. Interesting.

The researchers want to observe the planet with the highest probability of transiting. So I need to figure out which planet has a higher transit probability.

Transit probability depends on a few factors. I remember that the probability is proportional to (R_planet / R_star)^2 multiplied by (something else?), wait. Oh right, the transit probability (geometric probability) is given by the formula (R_p / R_s)^2 * (a/(a + R_s)), but wait, no. Maybe another approach.

Wait, the probability of a transit is given by the formula (R_p + R_s) / a, but no, I think it's more about the alignment. The transit happens when the planet's orbital plane is edge-on relative to our line of sight. The probability is the ratio of the star's radius to the distance from the star to the planet's orbital plane.

Wait, no, the geometric probability is (R_p / R_s)^2 multiplied by (1 / (1 - eÂ²))^1/2, but both orbits are circular, so eccentricity e is zero. So the probability simplifies. Or wait, the formula for transit probability is (R_p / R_s)^2 * ( (a sin i) / (a cos i) ), but maybe I'm mixing things up.

Wait, I think the geometric probability of a transit is primarily determined by the relative size of the planet's orbit and the star's size, and the inclination. The transit probability is given by (R_p + R_s) / a, but that's not quite right. Wait, no, I think the formula is (R_p / R_s)^2 multiplied by (1 / (1 - (R_s/a)^2))^(1/2), but I
