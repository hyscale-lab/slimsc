Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem in front of me. It's about NMR spectroscopy and some reactions leading to a product. I'm a bit rusty, but let me try to think this through step by step.

The problem starts with Compound A, which has two signals in the proton NMR. The first is a triplet at 0.9 ppm integrating for 6H, and the second is a quartet at 1.3 ppm for 4H. Hmm, I remember that in NMR, the splitting tells us about neighboring protons. So a triplet means each proton is next to two others, and a quartet implies each is next to three.

Looking at the integration: 6H and 4H. So that's a total of 10H. Wait, but a molecule won't have only 10 protons. Oh, wait, maybe it's part of a larger structure. Let me think about common compounds with such NMR signals.

The 0.9 ppm triplet for 6H makes me think of something like two methyl groups adjacent to a CH2. Because each CH2 would split the adjacent CH3 into a triplet. Like in diethyl ether? No, diethyl ether's splitting is a quartet, maybe. Or wait, maybe it's something else.

Wait, think about neopentane or 2,2-dimethylpropane. No, that would have a singlet for the CH3 groups. Oh, wait, maybe it's diethyl something. Like diethyl ether has OCH2CH3 groups. The CH3 would be split by the adjacent CH2.

Wait, diethyl ether's structure is CH2CH3-O-CH2CH3. The CH3 groups are adjacent to CH2, which have two H on each side. So the CH3 would be a quartet because each is adjacent to a CH2 with two H. Wait, no, the CH3 in diethyl ether would be next to OCH2, which has two H. So the CH3 would be a triplet because each CH3 is next to a CH2 with two H. So integrating for 3H each, but in the question, the triplet is 6H. Oh, because each CH3 in diethyl ether has 3H. So two CH3 groups would total 6H. So the triplet at 0.9 ppm (which is around where CH3 in ethers appear) for 6H would support that. Then the quartet at 1.3 ppm for 4Hâ€”each CH2 would have two H each, so two CH2 groups would be 4H.
