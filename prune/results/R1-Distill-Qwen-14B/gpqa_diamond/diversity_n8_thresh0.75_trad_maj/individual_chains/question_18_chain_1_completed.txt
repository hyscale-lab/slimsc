Okay, so I've got this question about stars and their elemental abundances. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's think it through.

So the question is about finding the ratio of silicon atoms in two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. They each have different masses, but I'm not sure if mass affects the elemental ratios here. The problem gives me some abundances using the EW method under LTE, which I think stands for Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium. Oh right, LTE is a common assumption in stellar atmospheres modeling, so that makes sense.

The given data points are:
- [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 dex. So that's the logarithm of the ratio of silicon to iron abundances in Star 1 relative to the Sun.
- [Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3 dex for Star 2. So magnesium to silicon ratio in Star 2 compared to the Sun.
- [Fe/H]_1 = 0 dex. That means the iron abundance of Star 1 is the same as the Sun's.
- [Mg/H]_2 = 0 dex. So magnesium in Star 2 is same as the Sun.

Also, the Sun's photospheric composition is given:
- 12 + log(nFe/nH) = 7.5. So log(nFe/nH) is 7.5 -12 = -4.5. Wait, no, wait. Let me think. Oh wait, the notation is [X/H] = log(nX/nH) - log(nX/nH)_sun. Or is it? Wait, no, the notation is as follows: the abundance [X/Y] is defined as log(nX/nY) - log(nX/nY)_sun. So for [Fe/H], it's log(nFe/nH) - log(nFe/nH)_sun.

Wait, but the Sun's [Fe/H] is given as 12 + log10(nFe/nH) =7.5. Wait, that can't be. Oh wait, no, wait. The standard notation is that the solar value is set to 0. So for the Sun, [Fe/H] would be 0, because it's the reference. So the given data for the Sun is 12 + log(nFe/nH) =7.5. That implies log(nFe/nH) = 7.5 -12 = -4.5. So nFe/nH is 10^(-4.5) = approximately 3.16e-5.

Similarly, for magnesium, the Sun's 12 + log(nMg/nH) =7. So log(nMg/nH) =7 -12 =-5. So nMg/nH is 10^-5 = 1e-5.

Wait, but how does this help me? I need to find the ratio of silicon in Star 1 and Star 2. So the ratio [Si/Star1]/[Si/Star2], or is it [nSi]_1 / [nSi]_2?

No, the question says the ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star 1 and Star 2. So that's (nSi1) / (nSi2).

So to find that, I need to express nSi1 and nSi2 in terms of the given abundances.

Let me break it down for each star.

Starting with Star 1:

Given [Fe/H]_1 = 0. So [Fe/H] is log(nFe1/nH1) - log(nFe_sun/nH_sun) = 0. Therefore, nFe1/nH1 = nFe_sun / nH_sun.

But wait, the Sun's nFe/nH is 10^(-4.5), as I calculated earlier.

So nFe1/nH1 = 10^(-4.5). That means that Star 1's Fe abundance is same as the Sun's.

Also, [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3. So [Si/Fe]_1 = log(nSi1/nFe1) - log(nSi_sun/nFe_sun) = 0.3.

But I know nFe1/nH1 = same as Sun, which is nFe_sun/nH_sun.

Wait, perhaps it's better to express all this in terms of the Sun's abundances.

Let me denote the solar values as:

nFe_sun / nH_sun = F = 10^(-4.5).

nMg_sun / nH_sun = M = 1e-5, as per the given data.

nSi_sun / nH_sun = S. Wait, but wait, do I have the Sun's [Si/H]?

No, but perhaps I can find it using the given data. Let's see. Because I know [Mg/Si]_2 =0.3 dex.

Wait no, that's Star 2. Hmm.

Wait, but for Star 1, [Si/Fe]_1 is 0.3. Let me see.

So for Star 1, [Si/Fe] = log(nSi1 / nFe1) - log(nSi_sun / nFe_sun) ) = 0.3.

But since [Fe/H]_1 is 0, nFe1/nH1 = nFe_sun/nH_sun = F.

So nFe1 = F * nH1.

Similarly, for Star 1, Si abundance: nSi1 = (nFe1) * 10^{ [Si/Fe]_1 + log(nSi_sun/nFe_sun) }.

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to express [X/Y] = log(nX/nY) - log(nX_sun/nY_sun).

So for Star 1:

[Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 = log(nSi1 / nFe1) - log(nSi_sun / nFe_sun).

Which means:

nSi1 / nFe1 = 10^{0.3} * (nSi_sun / nFe_sun).

But since [Fe/H]_1 is 0, nFe1 = F * nH1, where F = nFe_sun/nH_sun.

Similarly, for the Sun, nFe_sun = F * nH_sun.

So, let's see: nSi1 = (nFe1) * (10^{0.3} * (nSi_sun / nFe_sun)) ).

Substituting nFe1 = F * nH1:

nSi1 = (F * nH1) * (10^{0.3} * (nSi_sun) / (F * nH_sun)) )

Wait, because nFe_sun = F * nH_sun.

So nSi_sun/nFe_sun = (nSi_sun) / (F * nH_sun) )

Wait, but how can I find nSi_sun? Because I don't have that. Oh wait, but I know [Mg/Si]_2 for Star 2.

Wait, perhaps I should handle each star separately, and express all in terms of the Sun's abundances.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to express everything in terms of nH, since we're dealing with ratios.

Let me try this for Star 1:

nFe1 = F * nH1.

nSi1 = (nFe1) * 10^{0.3} * (nSi_sun / nFe_sun).

But nFe_sun = F * nH_sun.

So substituting:

nSi1 = F * nH1 * 10^{0.3} * (nSi_sun) / (F * nH_sun) )

The F cancels out:

nSi1 = nH1 * 10^{0.3} * nSi_sun / nH_sun.

But nH1 is the hydrogen in Star 1. Wait, but how does that relate to the Sun's nH?

Alternatively, perhaps I should express nSi1 in terms of nH1, and then find nSi1 relative to nH1.

Wait, perhaps let's think in terms of the ratio nX/nH for each element.

So for Star 1, [Fe/H]_1 =0 → nFe1/nH1 = F.

[Si/Fe]_1 =0.3 → nSi1/nFe1 = 10^{0.3} * (nSi_sun / nFe_sun).

So nSi1/nH1 = (nSi1/nFe1) * (nFe1/nH1).

Which is (10^{0.3} * (nSi_sun / nFe_sun)) ) * F.

Because nFe1/nH1 = F.

So, nSi1/nH1 = 10^{0.3} * (nSi_sun / nFe_sun) * F.

But nFe_sun = F * nH_sun.

So nSi_sun / nFe_sun = (nSi_sun) / (F * nH_sun).

Therefore, substituting:

nSi1/nH1 = 10^{0.3} * (nSi_sun)/(F * nH_sun) * F.

The F cancels:

nSi1/nH1 = 10^{0.3} * nSi_sun / nH_sun.

So that's nSi1/nH1 = 10^{0.3} * (nSi_sun / nH_sun).

Which means that the silicon to hydrogen ratio in Star 1 is 10^{0.3} times the solar ratio.

Wait, but what is the solar [Si/H]?

Let me compute that.

Wait, the Sun's nFe/nH is F = 10^{-4.5}.

But what about nSi/nH for the Sun?

Hmm, the problem only gives us the Sun's [Fe/H] and [Mg/H]. So perhaps I can get [Si/H]_sun from some other given data.

Wait, looking back, the question gives [Mg/Si]_2 =0.3. So for Star 2, which has [Mg/H]_2=0.

Wait, let me think about Star 2 first.

Star 2: [Mg/Si]_2 =0.3. So [Mg/Si] = log(nMg2/nSi2) - log(nMg_sun/nSi_sun) ) =0.3.

And [Mg/H]_2 =0 → log(nMg2/nH2) = log(nMg_sun/nH_sun) → nMg2/nH2 =nMg_sun/nH_sun = M.

Which is 1e-5, as computed earlier.

So, for Star 2:

nMg2/nH2 =M.

Also, [Mg/Si]_2 =0.3 → nMg2 /nSi2 =10^{0.3} * (nMg_sun /nSi_sun).

So nMg2 =10^{0.3} * (nMg_sun /nSi_sun) * nSi2.

But nMg2 = M *nH2 → M *nH2 =10^{0.3} * (nMg_sun /nSi_sun) *nSi2.

So rearranging: nSi2 = (M * nH2) * nSi_sun / (nMg_sun * 10^{0.3} )

But nH2 is the hydrogen in Star 2. However, perhaps it's more useful to express nSi2/nH2.

Because for the ratio of silicon in Star 1 and Star 2, we can compute (nSi1/nH1) / (nSi2/nH2) = (nSi1/nH1) * (nH2/nSi2).

Wait, no, actually, the ratio of nSi in the two stars is (nSi1 / nH1) / (nSi2 /nH2) → (nSi1/nH1) * (nH2 / nSi2).

But I'm not sure if this is the right approach. Alternatively, maybe I should express both nSi1 and nSi2 in terms of nH for each star, and then take the ratio.

Wait, let's get back to Star 1 first.

We have for Star 1:

nSi1/nH1 = 10^{0.3} * (nSi_sun /nH_sun).

Because, as we derived earlier, nSi1/nH1 = 10^{0.3} * (nSi_sun /nH_sun).

So that's the [Si/H]_1 = log(nSi1/nH1) - log(nSi_sun/nH_sun) =0.3.

Wait, no, [Si/H] is log(nSi/nH) relative to the Sun. So [Si/H]_1 = log(nSi1/nH1) - log(nSi_sun /nH_sun) )= 0.3.

Which implies that nSi1/nH1 = 10^{0.3} * (nSi_sun /nH_sun).

So, nSi1/nH1 = 10^{0.3} * [Si/H]_sun.

Wait, but [Si/H]_sun is 0, since it's the reference. No, wait, [X/H] is the logarithm of (nX/nH) divided by solar value. So for the Sun, [X/H] is zero. So [Si/H]_sun =0.

Wait, no, that's not correct. Wait, [X/H] is defined as log(nX/nH) - log(nX/nH)_sun. So for the Sun, [X/H] is zero for all elements. So the Sun has [Fe/H]=0, [Mg/H]=0, [Si/H]=0, etc.

So, the problem gives us [Fe/H]_1=0, which means Star 1's Fe abundance is same as Sun's. Similarly, [Fe/H]_sun is zero.

But for the Sun's own [Si/H], it's zero as per the definition.

Wait, but the data given includes [Si/Fe]_1=0.3, which is the log of (nSi1/nFe1) / (nSi_sun/nFe_sun) ) =0.3.

So, nSi1/nFe1 = 10^{0.3} * (nSi_sun /nFe_sun).

But for the Sun, [Fe/H]=0, so nFe_sun/nH_sun =F.

Hmm, perhaps I'm getting tangled up here.

Wait, let's take a different approach.

We can calculate the ratio of silicon in Star 1 to that in Star 2. So the ratio is (nSi1 / nH1) / (nSi2 /nH2) → (nSi1/nH1) * (nH2/nSi2).

We need to compute this.

So let's find nSi1/nH1 and nSi2/nH2.

For Star 1:

We have [Fe/H]_1=0, so nFe1/nH1 = nFe_sun/nH_sun = F=1e-4.5.

Also, [Si/Fe]_1=0.3 → nSi1/nFe1 = 10^{0.3} * (nSi_sun/nFe_sun).

But nFe_sun/nH_sun = F. So nFe_sun = F * nH_sun.

So nSi_sun/nFe_sun = nSi_sun/(F *nH_sun) = (nSi_sun/nH_sun)/F.

But [Si/H]_sun = 0 → log(nSi_sun/nH_sun) - log(nSi_sun/nH_sun) =0 → which is true for any [X/H].

Wait, perhaps I can express everything in terms of the Sun's [X/H].

Wait, for the Sun, [Fe/H]_sun=0, [Mg/H]_sun=0, [Si/H]_sun=0.

Wait, but the problem gives us the Sun's 12 + log(nFe/nH)=7.5. So log(nFe/nH)= -4.5. So [Fe/H]_sun = log(nFe/nH)_sun - log(nFe/nH)_sun =0.

Similarly, for Mg, 12 + log(nMg/nH) =7 → log(nMg/nH)= -5 → [Mg/H]_sun=0.

But what about [Si/H]_sun? Do we know that? Because if we don't, we can't proceed.

Wait, but can we find [Si/H]_sun using the data about Star 2? Because Star 2 has [Mg/Si]_2=0.3 and [Mg/H]_2=0.

So for Star 2, [Mg/H]_2=0 → nMg2/nH2 = nMg_sun/nH_sun = M=1e-5.

And [Mg/Si]_2 =0.3 → log(nMg2/nSi2) - log(nMg_sun/nSi_sun) )=0.3 → nMg2/nSi2 = 10^{0.3} * (nMg_sun/nSi_sun).

So, nMg2 =10^{0.3} * (nMg_sun/nSi_sun) * nSi2.

But nMg2 is also M *nH2.

So,

M *nH2 = 10^{0.3} * (nMg_sun/nSi_sun) *nSi2.

We can rearrange this:

nSi2 = (M *nH2) * (nSi_sun) / (nMg_sun * 10^{0.3} )

But nH2 is the hydrogen in Star 2, and nMg_sun is M * nH_sun.

Because for the Sun, nMg_sun = M_sun * nH_sun.

Wait, no, nMg_sun/nH_sun = M =1e-5 → nMg_sun = M * nH_sun.

So substituting:

nSi2 = [M *nH2] * [nSi_sun] / [ (M * nH_sun) *10^{0.3} ) ]

Simplify:

M cancels out.

nSi2 = [nH2 * nSi_sun] / [nH_sun *10^{0.3} ]

So,

nSi2/nH2 = nSi_sun/(nH_sun *10^{0.3} )

Which can be written as:

nSi2/nH2 = (nSi_sun/nH_sun) * 10^{-0.3}.

But [Si/H]_sun=0, so nSi_sun/nH_sun =10^{0} =1? Wait, no, [X/H] is log(nX/nH). So for the Sun, [Si/H]_sun=0 → log(nSi_sun/nH_sun)=0 → nSi_sun/nH_sun=1.

Wait, no, wait. Oh wait, that's not correct. Because for the Sun, [Fe/H] is zero, which is log(nFe/nH) - log(nFe_sun/nH_sun) =0 → which is just log(nFe/nH) equals the solar value.

Wait, no, the problem gives Sun's photospheric composition as 12 + log(nFe/nH) =7.5 → log(nFe/nH) = -4.5. So, for the Sun, [Fe/H]_sun = log(nFe/nH)_sun - log(nFe/nH)_sun =0.

But the Sun's [Si/H]_sun is zero. So nSi_sun/nH_sun is 10^{0} =1? Wait, no, that can't be right because then [Si/Fe]_sun would be log(1/(1e-4.5)) = log(1e4.5)=4.5, which is high. But that's probably correct because the Sun's Si is more abundant than Fe.

Wait, maybe I'm confusing the notation. Let me think again: for the Sun, [X/H] is the log of (nX/nH) divided by the solar value. But for the Sun itself, [X/H] is zero for all X because it's the reference.

So the Sun's [Fe/H] is zero. So log(nFe/nH)_sun = log(nFe_sun/nH_sun) = -4.5.

Similarly, for [Si/H]_sun, log(nSi_sun/nH_sun) =0 → nSi_sun/nH_sun =10^0=1.

Wait, that can't be correct because Fe is much less abundant than Si. Hmm, perhaps I'm making a mistake here.

Wait, let's think about this. The way [X/H] is defined is as log(nX/nH) - log(nX_sun/nH_sun). So for the Sun, [X/H] is zero because the second term is the same as the first. So for the Sun, nX/nH is the same as nX_sun/nH_sun, so the ratio is 1, and the log is zero.

Wait, but that would mean that for the Sun, nSi/nH is 1 (since [Si/H]_sun=0), and nFe/nH is 1e-4.5, and nMg/nH is 1e-5.

But that seems conflicting because in reality, Si is more abundant than Fe, but I'm not sure about the exact numbers. But according to the problem statement, the Sun's data is as given.

So for the Sun:

nFe/nH =1e-4.5 → [Fe/H]_sun=0.

nMg/nH=1e-5 → [Mg/H]_sun=0.

nSi/nH=1 → [Si/H]_sun=0.

So, for the Sun, [Fe/Si]_sun = log( (nFe/nH) / (nSi/nH) ) = log( (1e-4.5) / 1 )= log(1e-4.5 )= -4.5.

So the Sun's [Fe/Si] is -4.5.

But back to Star 2.

nSi2/nH2 = (nSi_sun/nH_sun) *10^{-0.3} = 1 *10^{-0.3} ≈ 0.501.

Because [Mg/Si]_2 is 0.3, so [Mg/Si]_2 =0.3 → nMg2/nSi2 =10^{0.3} * nMg_sun/nSi_sun.

Since nMg_sun/nSi_sun = (1e-5)/1 =1e-5.

So nMg2/nSi2 =10^{0.3} *1e-5.

But nMg2 = M *nH2 =1e-5 *nH2.

So,

1e-5 *nH2 /nSi2 =10^{0.3} *1e-5 → nH2/nSi2 =10^{0.3} → nSi2 =nH2 / 10^{0.3}.

So, nSi2/nH2 =1/(10^{0.3}) ≈ 0.501.

Which is what I got earlier.

So for Star 2, nSi2/nH2 ≈0.501.

Now for Star 1:

nFe1/nH1 = F=1e-4.5.

[Si/Fe]_1=0.3 → nSi1/nFe1 =10^{0.3} * (nSi_sun/nFe_sun).

nSi_sun/nFe_sun= (1)/(1e-4.5)=1e4.5.

So,

nSi1/nFe1 =10^{0.3} *1e4.5.

So,

nSi1 = nFe1 *10^{0.3} *1e4.5.

But nFe1 =F *nH1=1e-4.5 *nH1.

So,

nSi1 =1e-4.5 *nH1 *10^{0.3} *1e4.5.

The 1e-4.5 and 1e4.5 cancel out.

So, nSi1= nH1 *10^{0.3}.

Thus, nSi1/nH1= 10^{0.3} ≈2.0.

So Star 1's Si abundance is about 2.0 times nH1 per unit.

Wait, but earlier for Star 2, nSi2/nH2 is about 0.501.

So the ratio of nSi1/nH1 to nSi2/nH2 is (2) / (0.501) ≈3.99, which is approximately 4.

Wait, that would mean that Star 1 has more silicon atoms per hydrogen atom than Star 2, so the ratio of their silicon atoms is about 4.

Wait, but the question asks for the ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2. So that's (nSi1) / (nSi2).

Wait, but wait, each star has its own hydrogen. So perhaps the ratio is (nSi1/nH1) / (nSi2/nH2) ) * (nH2/nH1).

But wait, that would be (nSi1/nH1) * (nH2/nSi2) ) * (nH2/nH1) ?

No, perhaps not. Wait, nSi1 and nSi2 are the number of Si atoms in each star, but each star has a different total number of atoms, so how are we comparing their silicon abundances?

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is to compute [Si/H] for each star, which is log(nSi/nH) relative to the Sun.

Because the ratio of Si atoms would be (nSi1/nH1) / (nSi2/nH2) ) * (nH2/nH1) → no, that doesn't make sense.

Wait, perhaps the ratio is (nSi1 /nH1) / (nSi2 /nH2) ) → which would be (nSi1/nH1) * (nH2/nSi2).

But nH1 and nH2 are the hydrogen in each star, which are different. So unless we can relate nH1 and nH2, we can't proceed.

Wait a minute, but maybe the total number of hydrogen atoms in each star isn't needed because when we take the ratio of silicon atoms, the hydrogens cancel out.

Wait, no. Let's see: the ratio is (nSi1) / (nSi2).

But if each star has different nH, then nSi1 = (nSi1/nH1) *nH1.

Similarly, nSi2 = (nSi2/nH2) *nH2.

So the ratio is [ (nSi1/nH1) *nH1 ] / [ (nSi2/nH2) *nH2 ].

Which simplifies to (nSi1/nH1) / (nSi2/nH2) ) * (nH1/nH2).

But without knowing nH1 and nH2, we can't compute this. Wait, but perhaps the question is simply asking for the ratio of (nSi1/nH1) to (nSi2/nH2), which is (nSi1/nH1) / (nSi2/nH2) ).

Because nH1 and nH2 are in their own stars and we don't have any information about their total hydrogen, perhaps the question is intended to be this ratio, which would be [Si/H]_1 / [Si/H]_2, but that's not exactly the right way because [Si/H] is a log scale.

Wait, no. [Si/H] is log(nSi/nH) - log(nSi_sun/nH_sun).

So for Star 1, [Si/H]_1 = log(nSi1/nH1) - 0 → log(nSi1/nH1).

Similarly, for Star 2, [Si/H]_2 = log(nSi2/nH2).

The ratio (nSi1/nH1)/(nSi2/nH2) ) = 10^{ [Si/H]_1 - [Si/H]_2 }.

So, if I can find [Si/H]_1 and [Si/H]_2 for each star, then I can compute the ratio.

So let's compute [Si/H]_1 and [Si/H]_2.

From earlier analysis:

For Star 1:

nSi1/nH1 =10^{0.3} * (nSi_sun/nH_sun) =10^{0.3} *1.

Because nSi_sun/nH_sun =1.

So [Si/H]_1 = log(10^{0.3} *1) → log(10^{0.3})=0.3.

So [Si/H]_1=0.3.

For Star 2:

nSi2/nH2 =0.501 → approximately 10^{-0.3}.

So [Si/H]_2 = log(0.501) = log(10^{-0.3} ) = -0.3.

So [Si/H]_1 =0.3, [Si/H]_2= -0.3.

The ratio of (nSi1/nH1)/(nSi2/nH2) ) is 10^{ [Si/H]_1 - [Si/H]_2 } =10^{0.3 - (-0.3)}=10^{0.6} ≈3.98, about 4.

So the ratio is approximately 4. So looking at the options, option A is ~3.9.

But wait, let's double-check.

So for Star 1:

[Si/H]_1 =0.3 → nSi1/nH1 =10^{0.3}.

Star 2 has [Si/H]_2 =-0.3 → nSi2/nH2=10^{-0.3}.

So the ratio (nSi1/nH1)/(nSi2/nH2) )=10^{0.3}/10^{-0.3}=10^{0.6} ≈3.98, so ~4.

Thus, the answer would be option A: ~3.9.


To determine the ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2, we analyze the given elemental abundances and use the relationships between the number densities of elements relative to hydrogen.

     - \( n_{\text{Fe1}} / n_{\text{H1}} = n_{\text{FeSun}} / n_{\text{HSun}} = 10^{-4.5} \).  
     - \( n_{\text{Si1}} / n_{\text{H1}} = 10^{0.3} \cdot (n_{\text{SiSun}} / n_{\text{HSun}}) = 10^{0.3} \cdot 1 = 10^{0.3} \).  
   - For Star_2:  
     - \( n_{\text{Mg2}} / n_{\text{H2}} = n_{\text{MgSun}} / n_{\text{HSun}} = 10^{-5} \).  
     - From \( \log(n_{\text{Mg2}} / n_{\text{Si2}}) = 0.3 + \log(n_{\text{MgSun}} / n_{\text{SiSun}}) \),  
       \( n_{\text{Mg2}} / n_{\text{Si2}} = 10^{0.3} \cdot (n_{\text{MgSun}} / n_{\text{SiSun}}) = 10^{0.3} \cdot (10^{-5} / 1) = 10^{-5 + 0.3} = 10^{-4.7} \).  
     - Rearranging, \( n_{\text{Si2}} / n_{\text{H2}} = n_{\text{Mg2}} / (10^{0.3} \cdot n_{\text{MgSun}} / n_{\text{SiSun}}) = 10^{-0.3} \).  

4. **Ratio of Silicon Atoms**:
   - The ratio of silicon atoms in Star_1 to Star_2 is given by:  
     \[
     \frac{n_{\text{Si1}} / n_{\text{H1}}}{n_{\text{Si2}} / n_{\text{H2}}} = \frac{10^{0.3}}{10^{-0.3}} = 10^{0.6}.
     \]  
   - \( 10^{0.6} \approx 3.98 \), so the ratio is approximately **4.0**.

### Final Answer:
The ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2 is approximately **3.9**.
