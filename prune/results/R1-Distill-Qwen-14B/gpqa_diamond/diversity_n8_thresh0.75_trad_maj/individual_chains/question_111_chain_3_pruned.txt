Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit stuck, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question is asking.

The problem has two reactions, and I need to find the major products A and B for each. Then, I have to pick the correct options from A to D.

First reaction: 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one reacting with ethyl acrylate in the presence of t-BuOK. The product is A.

Second reaction: 1-nitropropane reacting with KOH, (E)-but-2-enenitrile, and water. Product is B.

I'll tackle each reaction one by one.

Starting with the first reaction. The starting material is 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one. Let me draw its structure mentally. Cyclohexanone has a ketone at position 1. Then at position 2, there's an ethyl group, and also at position 6, a methyl group. Wait, no, wait. Wait, the formula is 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethyl. So position 2 has an ethyl and a methyl group? Or is it that position 2 has an ethyl group, position 6 has a methyl group, and both are on the same carbon as the ketone?

Wait, no. The parent is cyclohexan-1-one. So the ketone is at position 1. The substituents are at 2 and 6. So position 2 has an ethyl and a methyl group attached, and position 6 has a methyl group.

So structure-wise, the cyclohexane ring has the ketone at carbon 1. Then, carbon 2 has an ethyl and a methyl group. Carbon 6 has a methyl group. So, the ring would have substituents in such a way that the ring is probably in a chair conformation. But maybe that's getting ahead of myself.

The reagent is ethyl acrylate with t-BuOK. t-BuOK is a strong, bulky base. So, this looks like a Claisen condensation or perhaps an aldol reaction. Wait, wait. Ethyl acrylate is an alpha, beta-unsaturated ester. So, when an alpha, beta-unsaturated ester reacts with a ketone in basic conditions, it's more likely a Michael addition or a conjugate addition.

Wait, but wait. The starting material is a ketone, and the reagent is ethyl acrylate. t-BuOK is a strong, bulky base
