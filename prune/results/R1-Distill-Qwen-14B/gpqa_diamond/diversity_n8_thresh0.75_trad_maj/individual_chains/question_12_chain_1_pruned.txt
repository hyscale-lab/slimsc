Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about finding the kinetic energy of product particles in a decay process. Let me try to work through it step by step. 

The question is: Pi(+) is at rest and decays into mu(+) and a neutrino (nu). The rest masses are given as 139.6 MeV for Pi(+) and 105.7 MeV for mu(+). I need to find the kinetic energies of the products. The options are A to D, each giving two values which I assume are the kinetic energies of mu(+) and the neutrino, respectively.

Hmm, I remember that in particle physics, when a particle at rest decays, the total energy and momentum must be conserved. Since the pion is at rest, its initial momentum is zero. So, the decay products must have equal and opposite momenta to conserve momentum. 

So, let's break this down. The initial energy of the Pi(+) is just its rest mass energy, which is 139.6 MeV. The decay products are mu(+) and a neutrino. 

Wait, neutrinos are tricky because they have very tiny (almost zero) mass. So, for the neutrino, its kinetic energy is approximately equal to its total energy since its rest mass is negligible. But for the muon, we can't ignore its rest mass since it's 105.7 MeV, which is a significant chunk compared to the pion's mass.

The total energy after decay should equal the total energy before. So, the sum of the energies of mu(+) and the neutrino should be 139.6 MeV.

But wait, energy conservation includes their rest masses. So, the total energy after decay is the sum of the rest mass energy of mu(+) plus the kinetic energies of both, plus the rest mass energy of the neutrino. But since the neutrino is massless (or nearly so), its rest mass energy is zero. So,

E_initial = E_mu + E_nu
139.6 MeV = (m_mu c^2 + K_mu) + K_nu

But since E_nu is the kinetic energy, because m_nu is negligible. So,

139.6 = 105.7 + K_mu + K_nu

So, K_mu + K_nu = 139.6 - 105.7 = 33.9 MeV.

Hmm, that's the sum of their kinetic energies
