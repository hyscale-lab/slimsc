Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, so I'll try to think it through carefully. Let's see what the question is asking.

The problem says we have an electron state |alpha> which is proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>. The |up> and |down> are eigenstates of the z-projection of the spin operator, which I think means they're the standard basis states for spin-½ particles. So, first, I probably need to normalize this state because the question says it's proportional, not necessarily normalized.

Then, there's an operator whose matrix representation has elements Aij. The rules are that Aij is hbar/2 if i is different from j, and 0 otherwise. So, I need to figure out what this operator looks like. Since the states are |up> and |down>, the matrix should be a 2x2 matrix. Let me think: for a 2x2 matrix, the off-diagonal elements are hbar/2, and the diagonal elements are zero. So the matrix would be:

[ [0, hbar/2],
  [hbar/2, 0] ]

Wait, no, because if i and j are different, so for A_12 and A_21, it's hbar/2, and the diagonal A_11 and A_22 are zero. That's correct.

Wait, no, wait. The problem says Aij is hbar/2 if i is different from j, else zero. So the diagonal elements are zero, and the off-diagonal are hbar/2. So the matrix is indeed the one I wrote.

Now, the question is to calculate the probability of measuring the particle in each eigenstate of this operator. Hmm. Oh wait, no—wait, the operator's eigenstates. So, the operator A has its own eigenstates, and when we measure the system, the possible outcomes are the eigenvalues of A, and the probabilities are the squared moduli of the projections onto each eigenstate.

Wait, but wait, maybe I'm mixing things up. The operator's matrix is given, so perhaps it's a spin operator in a different basis. Alternatively, perhaps it's the Pauli X operator scaled by hbar/2, since the standard Pauli X matrix is [[0,1],[1,0]], and when multiplied by hbar/2, gives the matrix A.

But wait, the Pauli X operator's eigenvalues are ±1, but when multiplied by hbar/2, the eigenvalues become ±hbar/2. So the operator A has eigenvalues ±hbar/2. So the eigenstates of A would be the eigenstates of Pauli X, which are (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2) and (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2), right? Because Pauli X swaps the spin-up and spin-down states.

So, if I can express |alpha> in terms of these eigenstates, then the probabilities of measuring each eigenvalue are the squares of the coefficients.

But wait, perhaps I should first write |alpha> and normalize it. Let's do that step by step.

So first, the state |alpha> is given as proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2 -i)|down>. Let me compute the normalization factor.

The state is |alpha> = (1+i)|up> + (2 -i)|down>. The norm squared is the sum of the squares of the magnitudes of the coefficients.

So the coefficient for |up> is (1 + i). Its magnitude squared is (1^2 + 1^2) = 2.

Coefficient for |down> is (2 - i). The magnitude squared is (2)^2 + (-1)^2 = 4 + 1 =5.

So the total norm is sqrt(2 +5) = sqrt(7). So the normalized state is (1 + i)|up> + (2 -i)|down> all divided by sqrt(7). So |alpha> = [ (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down> ] / sqrt(7).

Next, I need to express |alpha> in terms of the eigenstates of operator A. Since A is proportional to the Pauli X matrix, which has eigenstates |+x> = (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2) and |−x> = (|up> − |down>)/sqrt(2).

Alternatively, perhaps I should find the eigenstates of A. Let me think: since A is a 2x2 matrix with 0 on the diagonal and hbar/2 on the off-diagonal, which is (hbar/2) times the Pauli X matrix. The eigenstates of Pauli X are |+x> as I mentioned. So the eigenstates of A are the same as those of Pauli X, scaled by hbar/2, but the eigenstates don't depend on the scaling factor.

So, the eigenstates of A are |+x> = (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2) and |−x> = (|up> − |down>)/sqrt(2).

So, to find the probability of measuring each eigenstate, I need to compute the inner product of |alpha> with |+x> and |−x>, then take the modulus squared.

Wait, no. Alternatively, since the eigenstates are |+x> and |−x>, the probability of measuring the corresponding eigenvalue (hbar/2 and -hbar/2) is the square of the modulus of the coefficient of |+x> and |−x> in the expansion of |alpha>.

So let me express |alpha> in terms of |+x> and |−x>.

First, let me write |alpha> = a |+x> + b |−x>.

We can find a and b by projecting |alpha> onto |+x> and |−x> respectively.

So, a = < +x | alpha >.

Similarly, b = < −x | alpha >.

Let's compute a first.

|+x> = (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2)
So, < +x | = ( < up | + < down | ) / sqrt(2)

|alpha> is [ (1+i)|up> + (2 -i)|down> ] / sqrt(7)

So,

a = (1/sqrt(2)) [ < up | (1+i)|up> + < up | (2 -i)|down> + < down | (1+i)|up> + < down | (2 -i)|down> ] / sqrt(7)

Wait, perhaps it's easier to compute < +x | alpha >.

So,

a = [ (1+i) <up| + (2-i) <down| ] / sqrt(7)  multiplied by ( < up| + < down| ) / sqrt(2) )

So,

a = [ (1+i) <up| up> + (1+i) <up| down> + (2 -i) <down| up> + (2 -i) <down| down> ] / [ sqrt(7) * sqrt(2) ]

But <up| down> and <down| up> are zero. <up| up> and <down| down> are 1.

So,

a = [ (1+i) * 1 + (2 -i) *1 ] / (sqrt(7)*sqrt(2))

Simplify numerator: (1+i) + (2 -i) = 3 + 0i = 3.

So a = 3 / [ sqrt(7)*sqrt(2) ] = 3 / sqrt(14).

Similarly, compute b = <−x | alpha>.

|−x> = (|up> − |down>)/sqrt(2), so <−x | = ( <up| − <down| ) / sqrt(2)

So,

b = [ (1+i) <up| + (2 -i) <down| ] / sqrt(7)  multiplied by ( < up| − < down| ) / sqrt(2) )

So,

b = [ (1+i) <up| up> − (1+i) <up| down> + (2 -i) <down| up> − (2 -i) <down| down> ] / [ sqrt(7)*sqrt(2) ]

Again, <up|down> and <down|up> are zero, and <up|up> and <down|down> are 1.

So,

b = [ (1+i)*1 − (2 -i)*1 ] / (sqrt(7)*sqrt(2))

Wait, let me make sure. The terms would be:

(1+i) <up| up> = (1+i)*1 = 1+i

− (1+i) <up| down> = 0

+ (2 -i) <down| up> =0 

− (2 -i) <down| down> = -(2 -i)*1 = -2 +i

So adding these together: (1+i) + (-2 +i ) = (1-2) + (i +i ) = (-1) + 2i.

So, b = (-1 + 2i) / (sqrt(14)).

Now, the coefficients a and b are 3/sqrt(14) and (-1 + 2i)/sqrt(14), respectively.

The probabilities are |a|^2 and |b|^2.

Compute |a|^2: (3/sqrt(14))^2 = 9/14 ≈ 0.642857.

Compute |b|^2: | (-1 + 2i) |^2 / (14) = (1^2 + 2^2) /14 = (1+4)/14 =5/14≈0.35714.

Wait, but let me compute that accurately. 9/14 is 0.642857, which is about 0.64 when rounded to two decimal places. And 5/14 is approximately 0.357, around 0.36.

So the probabilities are approximately 0.64 and 0.36.

Now, the question also asks for the average value of the operator A. The average value is the expectation value <A> = <alpha| A |alpha>.

Alternatively, since the operator A has eigenvalues ±hbar/2, and probabilities p1 and p2, the expectation value is (hbar/2)*p1 + (-hbar/2)*p2.

Which simplifies to (hbar/2)(p1 - p2).

Here, p1 is |a|^2 =9/14, p2=5/14.

So,

Expectation value = (hbar/2)(9/14 -5/14) )= (hbar/2)(4/14) )= (hbar/2)(2/7) )= (hbar/2)*(2/7) )= hbar /7.

Wait, let me double-check that calculation.

Wait, 9/14 is the probability for eigenvalue +hbar/2, and 5/14 for -hbar/2.

So <A> = (9/14)(hbar/2) + (5/14)(-hbar/2) )= [ (9 -5)/14 ] * (hbar/2 )= (4/14)(hbar/2 )= (2/7)(hbar/2 )= (hbar/7).

So the expectation value is hbar/7.

Looking back at the options:

Option A) Probabilities 0.64, 0.36, and expectation hbar/7.

Option D) 0.61, 0.29, and 2hbar/sqrt(7).

Wait, but wait. Wait, let me think again about the expectation value. Alternatively, perhaps I should compute <A> directly using the matrix representation.

Wait, the operator A is (hbar/2) * [[0,1],[1,0]]. So the matrix is:

[[0, hbar/2],
 [hbar/2, 0]]

So, the expectation value is <alpha| A |alpha>.

Given that |alpha> is (1+i)|up> + (2 -i)|down>, normalized by 1/sqrt(7).

So |alpha> = [ (1+i), (2 -i) ]^T / sqrt(7).

Wait, wait, in the computational basis |up> is (1,0), |down> is (0,1). So the state |alpha> is a column vector [ (1+i)/sqrt(7), (2-i)/sqrt(7) ]^T.

The operator A is a matrix:

[ [0, hbar/2],
  [hbar/2, 0] ]

So, to compute <alpha| A |alpha>, we can compute the product.

Let me denote |alpha> as a column vector [ a; b ], where a=(1+i)/sqrt(7), b=(2-i)/sqrt(7).

Then, A|alpha> is (hbar/2) * [ [0,1], [1,0] [a; b] ] = (hbar/2) [b; a].

So, the expectation value is (1/sqrt(7)) [ (1-i), (2+i) ] times (hbar/2) [b; a].

Wait, perhaps it's easier to compute it as a dot product.

Alternatively, compute the expectation value as:

(alpha| A |alpha) = (a* , b*) * A * (a, b)^T) / 7 ?

Wait, wait, the state is |alpha> = [ a; b ] / sqrt(7).

So, <alpha| = [ a*, b* ] / sqrt(7).

Then, <alpha| A |alpha> = (1/7) [ a*, b* ] * A [ a; b ]

The matrix multiplication A [a; b] is [ b * (hbar/2), a * (hbar/2) ]^T.

So,

[ a*, b* ] * [ b (hbar/2), a (hbar/2) ) ]

Which is a* b (hbar/2) + b* a (hbar/2 )

= (hbar/2) [ a* b + b* a ]

But a* b + b* a is 2 Re( a* b ), which is 2 times the real part of a* b.

So,

Expectation value = (hbar/2) * [ 2 Re( a* b ) ] /7.

This simplifies to (hbar/2) * [ 2 Re( a* b ) ] /7 = (hbar /7 ) Re( a* b ).

Compute a and b:

a = (1 + i)/sqrt(7)
b = (2 - i)/sqrt(7)

a* = (1 - i)/sqrt(7)

So, a* b = [ (1 -i)(2 -i) ] /7.

Multiply (1 -i)(2 -i):

(1)(2) =2; (1)(-i) = -i; (-i)(2)= -2i; (-i)(-i)= i^2 = -1.

So sum: 2 - i -2i + (-1) = (2-1) + (-3i) =1-3i.

So, Re(a* b) = (1)/7 (because (1-3i)/7 has real part 1/7).

Wait, no. Wait, the Re( a* b ) is the real part of (1-3i)/7, which is (1)/7.

So,

Expectation value = (hbar/7) * Re( a* b ) = (hbar/7) * (1/7)? Wait, no, wait.

Wait, let me re-calculate:

I think I might have made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, a = (1+i)/sqrt(7), so a* = (1 -i)/sqrt(7).

b = (2 - i)/sqrt(7).

So,

a* b = [ (1 -i) (2 -i) ] / 7.

Multiply numerator:

(1)(2) =2; (1)(-i) = -i; (-i)(2)= -2i; (-i)(-i)= i^2 = -1.

So sum: 2 -i -2i -1 = (2-1) + (-3i) =1 -3i.

So, a* b = (1 -3i)/7.

The real part of a* b is 1/7.

So,

Expectation value = (hbar/7) * (1/7) ???

Wait wait, I'm getting confused. Because earlier, the way I set it up was:

Expectation value is (hbar/2) * [ a* b + b* a ] /7.

Wait, no, let's re-express.

Wait, earlier steps:

The expectation value is:

(1/7) [ a*, b* ] * A [a; b]

Which becomes (1/7) [ a* (hbar/2 b) + b* (hbar/2 a) )

Which is (hbar/(2*7)) [ a* b + b* a ]

Which is (hbar/(14)) [ a* b + (a* b)* ]

Because b* a is the conjugate of a* b.

So, a* b is (1 -3i)/7, and its conjugate is (1 +3i)/7.

So, adding them: [ (1-3i) + (1+3i) ] /7 = (2)/7.

So,

Expectation value = (hbar/(14)) * (2/7) ) = (hbar/(14)) * (2/7) )? Wait, no.

Wait, wait, let me recompute.

Wait, [a* b + b* a ] is (1-3i)/7 + (1+3i)/7 = (2)/7.

So, (hbar/(14)) * (2/7) ) = (hbar * 2 )/(14 *7 ) )= (hbar * 2 )/(98 )= hbar/49.

Wait, no, that can't be right, because earlier calculation using the eigenvalues gave me hbar/7.

So I must have made a mistake here. Let me try another approach.

Alternative approach: compute <alpha| A |alpha> by directly using the matrix elements.

The state |alpha> is:

(alpha components) = [ (1+i)/sqrt(7), (2-i)/sqrt(7) ]^T.

So, |alpha> is a column vector:

[ (1+i)/sqrt(7) ]
[ (2-i)/sqrt(7) ]

The operator A is:

[ [0, hbar/2],
  [hbar/2, 0] ]

So, A |alpha> is:

[ (0 * (1+i)/sqrt(7) + hbar/2 * (2 -i)/sqrt(7) ),
  (hbar/2 * (1+i)/sqrt(7) + 0 * (2 -i)/sqrt(7) ) ]

Simplify each component:

First component: hbar/2 * (2 -i)/sqrt(7) = [ (2 -i) hbar ]/( 2 sqrt(7) )

Second component: hbar/2 * (1 +i)/sqrt(7) = [ (1 +i) hbar ]/(2 sqrt(7) )

So, A|alpha> is:

[ (2 -i) hbar/(2 sqrt(7)) ],
[ (1 +i) hbar/(2 sqrt(7)) ) ]

Now, <alpha| is [ (1 -i)/sqrt(7), (2 +i)/sqrt(7) ].

Compute <alpha| A |alpha>:

= [ (1 -i)/sqrt(7), (2 +i)/sqrt(7) ] * [ (2 -i) hbar/(2 sqrt(7)), (1 +i) hbar/(2 sqrt(7)) ) ]^T

So, it's the dot product:

(1 -i)(2 -i) hbar/(2*7) + (2 +i)(1 +i) hbar/(2*7)

Compute each term.

First term: (1 -i)(2 -i) = 1*2 + 1*(-i) + (-i)*2 + (-i)*(-i) 

= 2 -i -2i + i^2 

= 2 -3i -1 (since i^2 = -1)

= 1 -3i.

So first term: (1-3i) * hbar / (14)

Second term: (2 +i)(1 +i) = 2*1 + 2*i + i*1 + i*i 

= 2 +2i +i +i^2 

= 2 +3i -1 

= 1 +3i.

So second term: (1 +3i) * hbar /14.

Adding both terms:

(1-3i +1+3i) * hbar /14 = (2) * hbar /14 = hbar/7.

Which matches the earlier result. So the expectation value is indeed hbar/7.

So the probabilities are 9/14 ≈ 0.64286 and 5/14 ≈ 0.35714.

Looking at the options, option A says 0.64, 0.36, and hbar/7.

So that's matching, except perhaps the probabilities are rounded to two decimal places.

So the probabilities are approximately 0.64 and 0.36, and expectation value is hbar/7.

Looking at the options:

Option A) 0.64, 0.36 and hbar/7.
Option D) 0.61, etc. So option A is correct.

Wait, the options list the probabilities as 0.64 and 0.36, which are 9/14 and 5/14, correct.

So the correct answer is option A.


To solve the problem, we start by analyzing the given state:

The state is proportional to \( | \alpha \rangle = (1+i)|\uparrow\rangle + (2-i)|\downarrow\rangle \), where \( |\uparrow\rangle \) and \( |\downarrow\rangle \) are the eigenstates of the \( z \)-projection of the spin operator. To normalize \( | \alpha \rangle \), we calculate the norm of the coefficients:

- Coefficient of \( |\uparrow\rangle \): \( 1+i \), magnitude squared \( = 1^2 + 1^2 = 2 \).
- Coefficient of \( |\downarrow\rangle \): \( 2-i \), magnitude squared \( = 2^2 + (-1)^2 = 4 + 1 = 5 \).

The total norm is \( \sqrt{2 + 5} = \sqrt{7} \). Thus, the normalized state is:

\[
| \alpha \rangle = \frac{(1+i)|\uparrow\rangle + (2-i)|\downarrow\rangle}{\sqrt{7}}.
\]

Next, we consider the operator \( A \), whose matrix representation is given by \( A_{ij} = \frac{\hbar}{2} \) if \( i \neq j \), and \( A_{ij} = 0 \) otherwise. This corresponds to the matrix:

\[
A = \frac{\hbar}{2} 
\begin{bmatrix}
0 & 1 \\
1 & 0
\end{bmatrix}.
\]

The eigenstates of \( A \) are the eigenstates of the Pauli \( X \)-matrix, which are:

\[
|+x\rangle = \frac{|\uparrow\rangle + |\downarrow\rangle}{\sqrt{2}}, \quad |-x\rangle = \frac{|\uparrow\rangle - |\downarrow\rangle}{\sqrt{2}}.
\]

To find the probabilities of measuring the eigenstates \( |+x\rangle \) and \( |-x\rangle \), we express \( | \alpha \rangle \) in terms of these eigenstates. The coefficients are calculated as:

\[
a = \langle +x | \alpha \rangle = \frac{(1+i) + (2-i)}{\sqrt{7}\sqrt{2}} = \frac{3}{\sqrt{14}},
\]
\[
b = \langle -x | \alpha \rangle = \frac{(1+i) - (2-i)}{\sqrt{7}\sqrt{2}} = \frac{-1 + 2i}{\sqrt{14}}.
\]

The probabilities are the squared magnitudes of these coefficients:

\[
P(+x) = |a|^2 = \left(\frac{3}{\sqrt{14}}\right)^2 = \frac{9}{14} \approx 0.64286,
\]
\[
P(-x) = |b|^2 = \left(\frac{-1 + 2i}{\sqrt{14}}\right)^2 = \frac{1^2 + 2^2}{14} = \frac{5}{14} \approx 0.35714.
\]

Rounding to two decimal places, the probabilities are approximately \( 0.64 \) and \( 0.36 \).

To compute the expectation value \( \langle A \rangle \), we use the eigenvalues \( \pm \frac{\hbar}{2} \) and their corresponding probabilities:

\[
\langle A \rangle = \left(\frac{\hbar}{2}\right)P(+x) + \left(-\frac{\hbar}{2}\right)P(-x).
\]

Substituting the probabilities:

\[
\langle A \rangle = \left(\frac{\hbar}{2}\right)\frac{9}{14} + \left(-\frac{\hbar}{2}\right)\frac{5}{14} = \frac{\hbar}{2} \cdot \frac{9 - 5}{14} = \frac{\hbar}{2} \cdot \frac{4}{14} = \frac{\hbar}{7}.
\]

Thus, the probabilities are \( 0.64 \) and \( 0.36 \), and the expectation value is \( \frac{\hbar}{7} \).

From the options provided, the correct choice is:

**A) 0.64, 0.36, and \( \frac{\hbar}{7} \).**

Answer: A
