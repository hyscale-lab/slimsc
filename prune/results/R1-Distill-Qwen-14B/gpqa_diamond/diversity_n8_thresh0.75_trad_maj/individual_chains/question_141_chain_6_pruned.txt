Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem to solve, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of these reactions. Let me try to break it down step by step.

The question says: 1-bromobenzene-2-d is treated with NaNH2 in condensed ammonia solvent. How many possible organic products are there in this reaction?

Hmm, first, I need to figure out what the structure of 1-bromobenzene-2-d is. Wait, wait, 1-bromo-2-d... Oh wait, wait, I think that's a typo. Maybe it's 1-bromo-2-dichlorobenzene? Or perhaps 1-bromo-2,4-dichlorobenzene? Wait, the 'd' probably stands for something else. Oh, wait, maybe it's 1-bromo-2,4-dichlorobenzene? Or perhaps it's 1-bromo-2,3,5,6-tetrafluorobenzene? No, I'm not sure. Wait, the 'd' could be a typo. Alternatively, perhaps it's 1-bromo-2,4-dichlorobenzene. Or maybe it's 1-bromo-2,5-dichlorobenzene. Alternatively, perhaps the 'd' is a mistake, and it's 1-bromobenzene-2-something. Wait, maybe it's something else. Alternatively, perhaps it's 1-bromo-2,4,6-trinitrobenzene? No, that doesn't make much sense.

Wait, maybe it's 1-bromo-
