Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem in front of me, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still new to this. But I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question says.

The question is about a compound X reacting with red phosphorus and HI. I remember that red phosphorus and HI are used in some kind of reaction, maybe a substitution or elimination. Oh wait, I think red phosphorus is used in the hydrolysis of alkyl halides, but wait, no, that's with water. Wait, maybe it's the Clemmensen reduction? No, Clemmensen uses Zn(Hg)/HCl and heat. Hmm. Oh wait, another reaction comes to mind: maybe the phosphorylation or something else. Wait, red phosphorus and HI—if I'm not mistaken, that's a reaction that converts alcohols to alkyl halides. Oh right! The reaction of an alcohol with HI in the presence of red phosphorus is a way to substitute the hydroxyl group with iodine. So, PPh3 is sometimes used for that, but red phosphorus and HI is another method. So, if compound X has an alcohol group, reacting it with red phosphorus and HI would replace the -OH with an -I group, making an alkyl iodide.

Wait, but wait—I think I might be mixing things up. Let me think again. Red phosphorus and HI is used for the substitution of alcohols to form alkyl halides. So, if compound X has an -OH group, when it reacts with red phosphorus and HI, it would form an alkyl iodide. Then, the next step is to determine what compound X is, and then what the product would be.

So, the first step is to figure out the structure of compound X based on the provided IR and NMR data.

Looking at the IR data: 

- 3400–2500 cm-1: This broad range suggests the presence of either O-H (from an alcohol or carboxylic acid) or N-H (but since the options don't have amines, probably O-H). The strong absorption around 3400 usually indicates an -OH group. 

- 1720 cm-1: That's a strong peak, which could be a carbonyl group. A carbonyl (C=O) stretch. Could be a ketone, aldehyde, ester, or carboxylic acid. But the 1720 is a bit on the lower side for a carboxylic acid (which is usually higher, around 1700-1725, but sometimes lower if there's hydrogen bonding). Wait, or maybe it's an ester or ketone. But let me think about the NMR.

Looking at the 1H NMR data:

- 10.5 ppm (bs, 1H): A broad singlet around 10.5. That's a strong indication of an -OH proton, like in a carboxylic acid. Because in carboxylic acids, the -OH proton is usually around 10-12 ppm and is broad. Alternatively, an alcohol's -OH would appear around 1-5 ppm, but in this case, it's 10.5. So, that suggests a carboxylic acid group, not an alcohol. So, compound X is a carboxylic acid.

Wait, but earlier I thought it's an alcohol because of the reaction with red phosphorus and HI. But if the IR has 1720, which is a carbonyl, and the NMR shows a peak at 10.5, that's a carboxylic acid. So maybe I was wrong earlier. Let me re-examine.

So, if compound X is a carboxylic acid, the reaction with red phosphorus and HI would be... Hmm. Wait, do they react? Because carboxylic acids are usually not directly reactive with HI. Or wait, perhaps I'm confusing the reagents. Red phosphorus and HI is used in the hydrohalogenation of alkenes, but when dealing with alcohols, it's used to make the alkyl halide. But if X is a carboxylic acid, maybe the reaction is different.

Wait, maybe the reaction is not about substitution. Another possibility: perhaps the reaction is with the acid group. But I'm not sure. Let me try to figure out what X is first.

So, the possible options are A, B, C, D. The options are either substituted benzene rings with a substituent (like ethyl or isobutyl groups) or a benzoic acid with substituents.

Looking at the NMR data again:

The 1H NMR has:

- 10.5 ppm (bs, 1H): likely the -COOH proton.

Then, 8.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.2 ppm (d, 2H). That looks like a para-substituted benzene ring. The doublets with 2H each suggest that the protons are in a para arrangement. For example, if you have a benzene ring with substituents in the para positions, such as -COOH or another group. But wait, the 8.0 ppm is more downfield than the 7.2, so perhaps the substituent is electron-withdrawing, which deshields the protons. A carboxylic acid group is meta-directing because it's deactivating. So, if the ring has a substituent, like a COOH group in the para position to another substituent, or perhaps it's a meta arrangement.

Wait, let me think. The NMR shows two doublets in the aromatic region. So, for a para-substituted benzene, the two protons adjacent to the substituent would be as a pair of doublets. For example, if the substituent is at position 4, then the protons at 2 and 6 would be adjacent, and their chemical shifts would be influenced by the substituent.

Wait, but let's think about the substituent. If the substituent is a COOH group, then the ring would have that group, and perhaps another substituent. Alternatively, the substituent could be an ester or something else. But given the IR data, let's see.

IR:

- 1720 cm-1: So, a carbonyl. If X is a benzoic acid, then the carbonyl would be around 1700. But in the IR it's at 1720, which is a bit higher. Hmm, but wait, carboxylic acids have a broad O-H stretch around 2500-3000, which the IR data shows (3400–2500 cm-1). So that fits. So, the 1720 is the C=O of the carboxylic acid.

Wait, but wait—another thought: carboxylic acids have a strong O-H stretch around 2500-3300 cm-1, which is present here as 3400–2500. So that makes sense.

So, X is a benzoic acid with some substituent.

Now, looking at the NMR:

The aromatic protons are at 8.0 (d, 2H) and 7.2 (d, 2H). The downfield shift suggests that the substituent is deactivating and meta-directing. For a para-substituted benzoic acid, the substituent would be at position 4. Wait, but let me imagine the structure.

If the benzoic acid is at position 4, and there's another substituent at position 1 (like in 4-ethyl), but wait, in the NMR, the two doublets could correspond to two sets of protons, each as a doublet. In a para-substituted benzene, each set of adjacent protons would be equivalent, giving a doublet.

Wait, actually, for a benzene ring with two substituents in the para positions, like substituent A at position 1 and substituent B at position 3, that might not be the case. Alternatively,
