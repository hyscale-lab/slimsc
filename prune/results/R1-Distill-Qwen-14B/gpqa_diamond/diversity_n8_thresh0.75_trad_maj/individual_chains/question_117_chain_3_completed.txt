Okay, so I've got this question about organic chemistry and isomerism, specifically optical isomerism. Hmm, I remember that optical isomerism is about molecules being non-superimposable mirror images of each other, which happens when there's a chiral center or some kind of stereogenic element.

Looking at the question, there are four compounds given, and I need to figure out which of them exhibit optical isomerism. The options are A to D, each combining different numbers.

Let me go through each compound one by one.

1. Dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate. Wait, biphenyl rings are connected by a single bond, right? So the two phenyl groups can rotate around that single bond. If the substituents are in positions that allow for different configurations, maybe they can form enantiomers. But wait, do they have a plane of symmetry? If the substituents are in such a way that even if you rotate the rings, the molecule isn't symmetric, then it might be chiral.

Alternatively, if the substituents are in positions that can't be mirrored, it would have optical isomerism. Let me visualize this. The substituents are at 2 and 6 positions on each phenyl. Wait, on each ring, the substituents are at 2 and 2' positions, and 6 and 6' positions. So each ring has two substituents: one at 2 and another at 6. So for each ring, the substituents are across from each other. Now, considering the biphenyl structure, the arrangement around the central bond might lead to cis and trans isomers. But wait, does that lead to optical activity? Or is that constitutional isomerism? No, cis and trans around a single bond are stereoisomers but not necessarily optical isomers unless there's a chiral center.

Wait, but the molecule as a whole could have a plane of symmetry. Let me think. If the substituents on each ring are in positions that create a symmetrical arrangement, maybe the molecule isn't chiral. Alternatively, if it's asymmetrical, then it would have optical isomers.

Alternatively, if each ring has substituents that make the entire molecule lack a plane of symmetry, then it can have enantiomers, hence optical isomerism. Hmm, I'm a bit confused here. Maybe it's better to come back after looking at the others.

2. Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate. Let's see the structure. Propanoate is CH2CH2COO-. Wait, 2-hydroxypropanoate would be: the propanoic acid is CH2CH(OH)COO-? Wait, no. Wait, 2-hydroxypropanoate would be HOCH2COOCH3? Wait, wait, propanoate is CH2CH2COO- but wait, propanoate is actually CH2CH2COO- but with substituents. Wait, propanoate is CH3CH2COO-, but 2-hydroxypropanoate would be HOCH2COO-. Wait, no, 2-hydroxypropanoic acid is (CH3)CO(OH)CH2OH? No, wait, maybe I'm getting the numbering wrong.

Wait, propanoate is CH2CH2COO-. The alpha carbon is the first CH2, the beta is the next CH2, and the gamma is the COO-. So 2-hydroxypropanoate would have the hydroxyl group on the beta carbon. So structure would be CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3. Wait, no, wait. The correct structure is: 2-hydroxypropanoate is the ester of 2-hydroxypropanoic acid. So the acid would be CH2(OH)CH2COOH, and the ester would replace the -OH of the acid with OCH3. So the structure is CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3. Now, does this have a chiral center? Let's see the carbons. The central carbon (the first CH2) is attached to:

- Two CH2 groups (left and right), but wait, wait, the structure is:

HOCH2CH2COOCH3?

Wait, no. Wait, 2-hydroxypropanoate would be HOCH2COOCH2CH3? No, I'm getting confused. Let me draw it.

Propanoate is CH3CH2COO-. 2-hydroxypropanoate would have the hydroxyl on the middle carbon. So it's CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3? No, wait, wait. Wait, propanoic acid is CH2CH2COOH. So the three carbons are CH3-CH2-COOH. So 2-hydroxypropanoic acid would be CH2(OH)CH2COOH. The ester would be CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3. So the structure is:

CH2(OH)-CH2-COOCH3.

Wait, but the central carbon (the one with the OH) is connected to:

- CH2(OH) on one side? No, wait, no. Wait, the structure is:

CH2(OH)-CH2-COOCH3. So the central carbon (CH2) is attached to:

- One OH group,

- One CH2 group (which is connected to COOCH3),

Wait, no, no. Wait, it's a three-carbon chain. The correct structure is:

The acid is CH2(OH)CH2COOH. So the ester would have the COOCH3.

So the molecule is:

CH2(OH)-CH2-COOCH3.

So the central carbon is the one with the OH. Let me see the groups attached to that carbon. It's a CH2 group, so the central carbon is the one with the OH. No, wait, the central carbon is the one in the middle: the structure is HO-CH2-CH2-COOCH3.

Wait, no, the structure is CH2(OH)-CH2-COOCH3. So the central carbon (the middle CH2) is connected to:

- A CH2(OH) group,

- Another CH2 group (the one with COOCH3),

Wait, no, that's not correct. Let me think again.

The molecule is 2-hydroxypropanoate, which comes from 2-hydroxypropanoic acid. The structure is:

HOOC-CH(OH)-CH3? No, wait, wait. Let me number the carbons. Propanoic acid is CH2CH2COOH. So Carbon 1: COOH, Carbon 2: CH2, Carbon 3: CH3. So 2-hydroxypropanoic acid would have the OH on Carbon 2. So structure is CH2(OH)CH2COOH. The ester would be CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3.

So now, the central carbon (Carbon 2) is attached to:

- One OH,

- One CH2 group (which is connected to the COOCH3),

Wait, no, Carbon 2 is connected to:

- Carbon 1: which is CH2 group leading to COOCH3,

- Carbon 3: which is another CH2 group,

Wait, wait no, Carbon 2 is the middle one. So Carbon 2 is connected to:

- Carbon 1: CH2 group which is connected to the COOCH3,

- Carbon 3: CH2 group which is connected to what? Wait, maybe I got the structure wrong. Let me try to write the structure.

Propanoic acid is CH2CH2COOH. So the three carbons are CH3-CH2-COOH. So 2-hydroxypropanoic acid is CH2(OH)CH2COOH. So the structure is:

CH2(OH)-CH2-COOH.

When esterified with methanol, the -OH of the acid is replaced by OCH3. So the ester is CH2(OH)-CH2-COOCH3.

Now, looking at the central carbon (the CH2 with OH), what's attached to it? The central carbon is the second carbon:

- Attached groups: 

   - One OH,

   - One CH2- (which is connected to the COOCH3),

   - Two other CH2 groups? Or wait, the central carbon is connected to:

Let me think: the central carbon is the second carbon in the chain. So attached to it are:

- The first carbon (CH2- group that's connected to the COOCH3),

- Two CH2 groups? No, wait, the central carbon is actually the middle CH2 in the chain, which is connected to two other carbons. Wait, no, maybe not. Let me think again.

Wait, the structure is:

CH2(OH) - CH2 - COOCH3.

So the central carbon (the CH2 with OH) is connected to:

- One OH,

- One CH2 group (towards the COOCH3),

- The adjacent CH2 group (on the other side, which is attached to the other CH2 group, but wait, the chain is CH2(OH)-CH2-COOCH3, so the central carbon is attached to:

- One OH,

- One CH2 group (connected to the COOCH3),

- Two CH2 groups? No, wait, wait, CH2(OH) is the first carbon, then CH2 is the second, then COOCH3 is the third.

Wait, no, maybe I'm getting it wrong. Let me count the carbons again. The ester is methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate. So propanoate is three carbons, with the ester on the first. The 2-hydroxypropanoate would have the OH on the second carbon. So the structure is:

CH2(OH) - CH2 - COOCH3.

So the central carbon (the second one) is connected to:

- One OH,

- One CH2 group (the first carbon),

- One CH2 group (the third carbon, which is connected to COOCH3),

Wait, but wait, the third carbon is COOCH3, which is a carbonyl group. So in this case, the central carbon is attached to:

- OH,

- CH2 (from the first carbon),

- CH2 (from the third carbon),

Wait, but each CH2 is a single bond, so that can't be. Maybe I should think in terms of substituents around the central carbon.

Wait, the central carbon (second carbon) is attached to:

- OH,

- Two CH2 groups,

- And a single bond to the third carbon (which is the COOCH3 group).

Wait, no. Alternatively, maybe the central carbon has:

- Two CH2 groups attached to it (left and right),

- An OH group,

- And a single bond to the COOCH3 group?

Wait, that can't be right because that would imply four substituents. Wait, the central carbon is CH2, which is CH2(OH) in the middle. So the groups are:

- OH,

- CH2 (from the first carbon),

- CH2 (from the third carbon),

Wait, but the first carbon is CH2(OH), and the third is CH2(COOCH3). Wait, this is getting confusing. Let me think differently.

Wait, perhaps the molecule is:

O
||
O-C-OCH3
|
CH2-CH(OH)-CH3

Wait, no, that's not right. Alternatively, maybe the structure is:

CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3.

So the central carbon (the CH2) is the second carbon. It's attached to:

- One OH,

- Two CH2 groups (left and right), but that can't be because that's three substituents, but a carbon has four bonds. So perhaps I'm wrong about the structure.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake. Let me try again. 2-hydroxypropanoate is the ester of 2-hydroxypropanoic acid. The acid is HOOC-CH(OH)-CH3? No, that would be 2-hydroxyl on the second carbon of propanoic acid. Wait, propanoic acid is CH2CH2COOH. So the three carbons are 1 (COOH), 2 (CH2), 3 (CH3). So 2-hydroxypropanoic acid is CH2(OH)CH2COOH. So the ester would be CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3.

So the structure is:

CH2(OH) - CH2 - COOCH3.

So the central carbon (the CH2) is the second carbon. It's connected to:

- OH,

- Two CH2 groups (left and right),

Wait, that can't be because each CH2 is a single bond, and that would only account for three substituents. Oh wait, perhaps the central carbon is a CH with four substituents? No, because in this case, the central carbon is CH2, which can't support four substituents. Hmm, this is confusing.

Wait, perhaps I should approach it differently. Does the molecule have a chiral center? A chiral center requires four different substituents attached to a carbon. So, in methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate, is there any carbon with four different groups?

Looking at each carbon:

1. The COOCH3 group is on the third carbon. The structure is CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3. The second carbon is CH2, which is attached to:

   - OH,

   - The first carbon (CH2),

   - The third carbon (CH2),

   - And another H? Wait, no, wait, a CH2 group has two CH2 groups attached? No, wait, each CH2 is a single bond. So the second carbon is CH2(OH)-CH2-... Wait, no, the second carbon is the middle one. Let me think about the substituents on each carbon.

Wait, the structure is:

CH2(OH) - CH2 - COOCH3.

So the second carbon (CH2) is attached to:

- OH,

- CH2 (from the left),

- CH2 (from the right),

- And a hydrogen? No, because CH2 would have two Hs. Wait, no, maybe each CH2 is CH2-CH2-.

Wait, perhaps the structure is:

HOCH2CH2COOCH3.

So, the second carbon (the middle one) is CH2. So attached to it are:

- OH,

- CH2 (left),

- CH2 (right),

- And a hydrogen? No, because that would give three substituents plus H, making four. Wait, but that would make it a CH2 group, not a CH with four substituents.

Wait, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Let's think about the structure again. The formula is CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3.

So the molecule is:

CH2(OH)-CH2-COOCH3.

So each CH2 is a single carbon. The middle CH2 is connected to:

- The left CH2(OH),

- The right CH2 (which is connected to COOCH3),

- And two H's. So the substituents are:

   - OH from the left,

   - CH2COOCH3 from the right,

   - Two Hs.

So, it's a CH2 group, so the central carbon has two Hs, one OH, and two CH2 groups. But that doesn't make it a chiral center because it has two identical substituents (the two CH2 groups). So no, this carbon isn't a chiral center. Therefore, the molecule doesn't have a chiral center and thus doesn't exhibit optical isomerism. Wait, but wait, maybe I'm missing something. Could there be another chiral center elsewhere? Let's see. The first carbon is CH2(OH), which is connected to:

   - Two H's,

   - One OH,

   - One CH2 (connected to the middle carbon).

So substituents are H, H, OH, and CH2. So the groups are: two Hs (same), OH, and CH2. That's three different groups, so not a chiral center. The third carbon is the COOCH3 group, which is connected to:

   - The middle CH2,

   - Two O's (from the ester group),

   - And a CH3.

But that's a carbonyl group, so no chiral center there either. So this molecule doesn't have any chiral centers. Therefore, number 2 doesn't show optical isomerism.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused. Did I get the structure right? Because another way to think about it, maybe the molecule is different. Suppose the OH is on a carbon that's connected to three different groups. Wait, perhaps I'm wrong about the structure. Let me think again: 2-hydroxypropanoate would be the ester of 2-hydroxypropanoic acid. So propanoic acid is CH3CH2COOH. The 2-hydroxy version would have OH on the middle CH2. So the ester would be CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3. So the structure is CH2(OH)-CH2-COOCH3.

Wait, another way to write this is CH3CH(OH)COOCH3? No, wait, that would imply the OH is on the central carbon. Wait, wait, no. Let me think about the numbering. Propanoate is CH2CH2COO-. So the three carbons are 1 (COO-), 2 (CH2), 3 (CH2). So 2-hydroxypropanoate would have the OH on carbon 2, so the structure is CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3. So the central carbon is the one with the CH2, but it's attached to two CH2 groups. So no, no chiral center.

Hmm, so I think compound 2 doesn't exhibit optical isomerism. But wait, that's confusing because I thought 2-hydroxypropanoate might have a chiral center. Maybe I made a mistake. Let me think again.

Wait, another approach: the molecule is HOCH2CH2COOCH3. So the central carbon is the second CH2. The groups attached are:

- OH,

- CH3 (from the first CH2),

- CH2COOCH3 (from the third carbon),

- And a hydrogen. Wait, no, each CH2 has two H's. So the substituents on the central carbon are:

   - OH,

   - CH2 (attached to a CH2),

   - CH2 (attached to COOCH3),

   - H.

Wait, so the substituents are OH, CH2 (from left), CH2 (from right), and H. So that would mean the substituents are:

- OH,

- CH2- (left),

- CH2- (right),

- H.

But the left and right CH2 groups are identical, so the substituents are H, OH, and two CH2 groups. So three different groups plus H, making four substituents but two are same (the two CH2 groups), so the central carbon can't be a chiral center. So no, it's not a chiral center. Therefore, compound 2 doesn't have optical isomerism.

Hmm, but wait, maybe I made a mistake in the structure. If the structure is different, perhaps the central carbon is a chiral center. Let me think another way: could the structure be HOOC-CH(OH)-CH3? No, that would be 2-hydroxypropanoic acid, but that's the acid, not the ester. No, the ester would be HOOC-CH(OH)-OCH3? No, that doesn't make sense.

Alternatively, maybe the correct structure is (R)- or (S)-configured. But if the molecule doesn't have a chiral center, then no. So perhaps compound 2 doesn't exhibit optical isomerism. Hmm.

Moving on to compound 3: benzophenone. Benzophenone is (Ph)2CO. It has two phenyl groups attached to a ketone. The structure is Ph-CO-Ph. Does this have any chiral centers? No, because the central carbon is double-bonded to oxygen and attached to two phenyl groups and one more group (but wait, the ketone is R-CO-R). So the central carbon is C=O, so it's a carbonyl group. The carbon is double-bonded to O, and attached to two phenyl groups. So, no chiral center here. The molecule is symmetrical, so no optical isomerism. So compound 3 doesn't show optical isomerism.

Compound 4: dimethyl fumarate. Fumarate is the cis isomer of maleate. So fumaric acid is a diacid with two double bonds in the cis configuration. The structure is HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH, but wait, no, fumarate is HO2C-CH=CH-COOH. So the dimethyl ester would be CH2(COOCH3)-CH=CH-COOCH3. Wait, no, fumarate is the cis diastereomer of maleate. So, the structure is (Z)-1,2-dicarboxyethene. So the dimethyl ester would be:

O
||
O-C-OCH3
|
CH2-CH2
        |
        O-CO-OCH3

Wait, no, I'm getting confused. Let me think. Fumarate is the cis isomer of maleic acid. So maleic acid is trans, and fumaric is cis. So the structure is HO2C-CH2-CH2-COOH? No, no. Wait, maleic acid is HO2C-CH=CH-COOH, with the double bond in the trans configuration, and fumaric acid is the cis version.

So dimethyl fumarate would be (Z)-dimethyl (2,2-difluorovinyl) something. Wait, no, the actual structure is:

O
||
O-C-OCH3
|
CH2-CH2
        |
        O-CO-OCH3

Wait, no, perhaps I should draw it correctly. The structure is CH2(COOCH3)-CH=CH-COOCH3, but in the cis configuration.

Wait, no, the correct structure is that fumarate is the cis isomer, so the two COOCH3 groups are on the same side of the double bond. So the structure is:

O
||
O-C-OCH3
|
CH2-CH2
        |
        O-CO-OCH3

No, wait, the correct structure is:

COOCH3
   \
C=C
   /
COOCH3

In the cis configuration, both COOCH3 groups are on the same side of the double bond. So the molecule would have a plane of symmetry if the substituents are on the same side. But wait, if the substituents are on the same side, would that create a chiral center? No, but wait, the molecule itself may have a plane of symmetry. Wait, the molecule is symmetric across the double bond. So each side is a COOCH3 group, so the molecule has a plane of symmetry along the double bond. Therefore, it's not chiral. So wait, but wait, can a molecule with a double bond in the cis configuration have geometric isomerism, but no optical isomerism? Because geometric isomerism is about different spatial arrangements around a double bond, not about chirality.

So in this case, dimethyl fumarate is a diastereomer of dimethyl maleate, but does that lead to optical isomerism? Wait, I'm getting mixed up between geometric isomerism and optical isomerism.

Wait, for a molecule to have optical isomerism, it must have a chiral center or another form of stereogenic element. In dimethyl fumarate, the substituents are on the same side of the double bond. However, the double bond itself is a line of symmetry, so the molecule is not chiral. So dimethyl fumarate doesn't have a chiral center. Therefore, it doesn't show optical isomerism. Wait, but I'm a bit confused. Or wait, maybe I'm missing something. Because if the substituents are on the same side, perhaps the molecule would have a plane of symmetry, making it achiral. So in that case, it doesn't have optical isomerism.

Wait, but wait a second. Does the structure of dimethyl fumarate have any stereogenic elements? No, because each substituent on the double bond is the same (COOCH3 groups), so the molecule is symmetric. So no, it doesn't have optical isomerism.

Wait, wait a minute. Maybe I'm wrong. Let's think again. Fumarate has the two ester groups on the same side of the double bond. So the structure is:

COOCH3
   \
C=C
   /
COOCH3

Wait, but in that case, the molecule would be meso, meaning it has a plane of symmetry, making it achiral. So dimethyl fumarate is actually a meso compound, which isn't chiral and doesn't exhibit optical isomerism.

Wait, but I might have made a mistake. Let me think about another scenario. Suppose the two substituents on the double bond are different. Then, the molecule could have geometric isomerism (cis and trans), but only if the substituents are different. But in this case, both substituents are the same (COOCH3), so the molecule isn't chiral and doesn't have optical isomerism.

Wait, but wait, dimethyl maleate would have the trans configuration, and if the substituents are the same, then the molecule would be meso and not chiral. So in that case, both fumarate and maleate would be meso, so no optical activity. Hmm, but I'm not sure. Maybe I'm mixing up the concepts of geometric isomerism and optical isomerism.

Wait, perhaps I should look for another approach. Let's think about each compound again.

1. Dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate.

So biphenyl with substituents at 2 and 2' on each ring, and 6 and 6' on each ring. So each ring has substituents at 2 and 6 positions.

Wait, the structure is like two benzene rings connected by a single bond. Each ring has two substituents: one at 2 and another at 6. So on each ring, the substituents are at positions 2 and 6. So each ring has two substituents opposite each other.

Wait, but if the two substituents are on each ring, the question is whether the arrangement leads to a chiral center or a stereogenic element.

Wait, but the molecule may have a plane of symmetry. For example, if placing the substituents on each ring in a way that makes the entire molecule symmetric, then it won't be chiral.

Alternatively, if the substituents are arranged asymmetrically, then it would be chiral.

Wait, let me think about the substituent positions. Each ring has two substituents: at 2 and 6. So on each ring, the substituents are across from each other, making each ring symmetrical. Now, when connected to each other, does the entire molecule have a plane of symmetry?

Alternatively, if the substituents on each ring are in such a way that the entire molecule is not symmetrical, then it would be chiral.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule has two substituents on each ring, and the arrangement leads to a chiral center somewhere. But in a biphenyl system, the substituents are on the benzene rings, which are planar. So the molecule's chirality would depend on whether the substituents create a non-superimposable mirror image.

Alternatively, the substituents could be in such a way that the molecule has a chiral axis or a plane that makes it non-chiral. Hmm, I'm getting stuck here. Maybe I should think about whether the molecule has a center of inversion or a plane of symmetry.

If each substituent is mirrored across the central bond, then the molecule would be achiral. But if not, then it would be chiral.

Wait, substituents at 2 and 6 on each ring—so on each ring, the substituents are opposite each other. So for the entire molecule, perhaps the arrangement is symmetric. So the molecule might not be chiral, meaning it doesn't exhibit optical isomerism.

Wait, but I'm not entirely sure. I might need to look for another approach.

So, going back, which of the four compounds exhibit optical isomerism?

From what I worked out earlier:

1. Not sure, but maybe no.

2. No.

3. No.

4. No.

Wait, that can't be right because the options don't include that. Let me re-express.

Wait, let me think again about each compound.

1. Dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate.

Each ring has substituents at 2 and 6. So each ring has two substituents opposite each other. The biphenyl is connected in a way that the substituents could lead to asymmetry. So if the substituents on each ring are in such a way that the entire molecule lacks a plane of symmetry, then it would be chiral.

Alternatively, considering the substituents are at 2 and 6 on each ring, the molecule might be symmetric. For example, if the substituents on each ring are in the same arrangement relative to the central bond, the molecule could have a plane of symmetry through the central bond, making it achiral.

Wait, but if the substituents are in positions that when you rotate the biphenyl, the arrangement becomes a mirror image, then it would be a chiral molecule. Hmm, perhaps the substituents are such that the molecule has no plane of symmetry.

Wait, perhaps the substituents are arranged in such a way that each ring's substituents are trans relative to each other, leading to a chiral arrangement. Alternatively, if they are cis, perhaps the molecule is symmetric.

But without knowing the exact structure, it's a bit hard. Alternatively, perhaps dimethyl biphenyl dicarboxylate with substituents at 2 and 6 would have a plane of symmetry, making it achiral.

But I'm not confident.

Alternatively, perhaps compound 1 doesn't show optical isomerism.

So far, according to my analysis, none of the compounds show optical isomerism, but the answer options have some combinations.

Wait, another approach: which of these have a stereogenic center (chiral center) or another form of stereoisomerism, like a double bond with E/Z isomerism leading to chirality.

Let me think again.

Compound 2: methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate. Earlier, I thought it doesn't have a chiral center, but perhaps I was wrong. Let me reevaluate.

The structure is CH2(OH)-CH2-COOCH3. So the second carbon is CH2, attached to:

- OH,

- CH2 (left),

- CH2 (right),

- H.

Wait, no, each CH2 has two H's. So the substituents on the central carbon are:

- OH,

- CH2 (left),

- CH2 (right),

- H.

But that's four substituents. Wait, no, the central carbon is CH2, which is connected to:

- One OH,

- Two CH2 groups,

- One H.

Wait, no, that's not possible because a CH2 group can't have four substituents. Wait, perhaps I'm miscalculating the structure.

Wait, wait, I think I made a mistake in the structure. Let me try to write the correct structure.

Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate is the ester of 2-hydroxypropanoic acid. The acid is CH3-CHOH-COOH. So the ester would be CH3-CHOH-COOCH3.

So the structure is:

CH3-CHOH-COOCH3.

Wait, that's different from what I thought earlier. So the correct structure is:

CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3.

So the central carbon is the CH(OH) group.

Now, looking at the substituents on this carbon (the second carbon):

- One CH3 group,

- One OH group,

- One COOCH3 group,

- And one H.

So four different substituents: CH3, OH, COOCH3, and H. Therefore, this carbon is a chiral center. So compound 2 has a chiral center and thus exhibits optical isomerism.

Ah, I see! Earlier, I misunderstood the structure. So compound 2 does have a chiral center and thus shows optical isomerism.

Now, that changes things. So compound 2 is positive for optical isomerism.

Looking back at compound 1: dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate.

Each ring has substituents at 2 and 6. So each ring has two substituents opposite each other. Now, the question is whether the entire molecule has a plane of symmetry or not.

If the substituents on each ring are in such a way that the entire molecule is symmetric, then it won't be chiral. Otherwise, it would be chiral.

Alternatively, in the case of a biphenyl with substituents at 2 and 6 on each ring, if the substituents are arranged in a way that creates a chiral center or a stereogenic element, then the molecule would be chiral.

Wait, but in a biphenyl system, the substituents are on aromatic rings, which are planar. So if the substituents are arranged asymmetrically, the molecule could be chiral.

Wait, but if both substituents on each ring are in the same positions relative to the central bond, the molecule might have a plane of symmetry. For example, if the substituents are trans across the central bond, the molecule could be symmetric, making it achiral.

Alternatively, if the substituents are in such a way that their arrangement around the central bond creates a non-superimposable mirror image, then it's chiral.

Wait, but without knowing the exact arrangement, it's hard to say. Another approach: does the molecule have a plane of symmetry?

If the substituents on each ring are arranged symmetrically, then yes, the molecule would be achiral. For instance, if substituents on each ring are in the same positions relative to the central bond, then the molecule would have a plane of symmetry.

But if the substituents are in different positions, then the molecule would lack a plane of symmetry and be chiral.

In this case, the substituents are at 2 and 6 on each ring. So for each ring, the substituents are opposite each other. Now, if the two rings have substituents in the same orientation relative to each other, then the molecule may be symmetric.

Wait, but perhaps the arrangement leads to no symmetry. For example, if the substituent on the first ring is in the 2 position, and the substituent on the second ring is in the 2' position, but their positions relative to the central bond make the arrangement asymmetric.

Wait, but I'm not certain. Alternatively, perhaps the molecule is symmetric.

Wait, perhaps the substituents are arranged in such a way that the molecule has a center of inversion or a plane of symmetry, making it achiral.

Hmm. I'm getting stuck here. Maybe I should think about whether the molecule has any stereogenic elements. If not, then it doesn't exhibit optical isomerism.

Alternatively, perhaps compound 1 doesn't have any chiral centers, so it doesn't exhibit optical isomerism.

Wait, but another thought: dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate. The substituents are at 2 and 6 on each ring. So each ring has two substituents opposite each other. So the molecule might have a plane of symmetry through the central bond. Therefore, it's achiral and doesn't exhibit optical isomerism.

So, compound 1: no optical isomerism.

Compound 2: yes.

Compound 3: benzophenone, no.

Compound 4: dimethyl fumarate.

Earlier, I thought fumarate is the cis isomer, which is a meso compound, so no optical isomerism. But wait, let me think again.

Wait, dimethyl fumarate is (Z)-dimethyl (2,2-dimethyl) something. No, wait, fumarate is the cis isomer of maleate. So the structure of dimethyl fumarate is:

COOCH3
   \
C=C
   /
COOCH3

In the cis configuration. Now, if the two substituents on each side of the double bond are the same (COOCH3), then the molecule is symmetric, making it a meso compound and thus achiral. Therefore, it doesn't exhibit optical isomerism.

So, compound 4: no optical isomerism.

So, from the four compounds:

1: No.

2: Yes.

3: No.

4: No.

So the only compound that exhibits optical isomerism is number 2.

Wait, but looking at the options:

Options are:

A) 1, 2 and 4

B) 3 and 4

C) 2 and 3

D) 1 and 2

Wait, in my analysis, only compound 2 exhibits optical isomerism, so none of the options match that. But that can't be, because the options don't have an option with only 2.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake. Let me re-examine.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake with compound 4. Let me think again.

Dimethyl fumarate: structure is (Z)-CH2(COOCH3)-CH2-COOCH3? No, no. Fumarate is (Z)-HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH. Wait, no, fumarate is (Z)-HOOC-CH=CH-COOH. So the dimethyl ester is (Z)-COOCH3-CH=CH-COOCH3.

So the structure is:

COOCH3
   \
C=C
   /
COOCH3

In the cis configuration. So, the substituents on each end are the same, making the molecule symmetric. Therefore, it's a meso compound and thus achiral, so no optical isomerism.

So, compound 4 doesn't show optical isomerism.

So, only compound 2 shows optical isomerism.

But looking at the options, none of them have only 2. Option A includes 1,2,4; option D includes 1 and 2.

Wait, but perhaps compound 1 does show optical isomerism. Let me think again.

Compound 1: dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate.

Each ring has substituents at 2 and 6. So each ring has two substituents opposite each other. Now, considering the biphenyl structure, if the substituents on each ring are arranged in a way that the entire molecule has no plane of symmetry, then it would be chiral.

But if the substituents are arranged symmetrically, then the molecule is achiral.

Wait, but in this case, each ring has two substituents in opposite positions, and they are the same on both rings, so the molecule may have a plane of symmetry through the central bond. Therefore, it would be achiral, so no optical isomerism.

So, I think only compound 2 shows optical isomerism.

But the options don't have an option with only 2. The closest is option A, which includes 1, 2, and 4. But I don't think 1 and 4 have optical isomerism.

Wait, another thought: perhaps I made a mistake with compound 4. Let me think again.

Dimethyl fumarate: is it a meso compound or not?

If the substituents are on the same side, but the molecule has a plane of symmetry, then it would be meso and achiral.

So, in that case, no optical isomerism.

So, the only compound showing optical isomerism is 2. But since none of the options match that, perhaps my earlier analysis is wrong.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake with compound 1. Let me think again.

Compound 1: dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate.

Each ring has substituents at 2 and 6. So, the substituents are on opposite ends of each ring. Now, if the substituents on each ring are arranged in a way that creates a chiral arrangement, then the molecule would be chiral.

Wait, but in a biphenyl system, the substituents can rotate around the central bond. So unless the substituents are in fixed positions that create a chiral arrangement, the molecule can be achiral. So perhaps the substituents are in such a way that the molecule has a plane of symmetry, making it achiral.

Alternatively, if the substituents are arranged in a way that there's no plane of symmetry, the molecule would be chiral.

But without knowing the exact structure, it's hard to say, but I'll assume that it's symmetric, so no optical isomerism.

So, back to the conclusion: only compound 2 shows optical isomerism.

But the options don't reflect that. So perhaps I made a mistake in the analysis.

Wait, perhaps compound 4 does have optical isomerism. Let me think again.

Dimethyl fumarate: if the substituents on the double bond are not the same, then it would have optical isomerism. But in this case, both substituents are COOCH3, so they are same.

Wait, but what if the molecule has another chiral center elsewhere? Let's see: the structure is CH2(COOCH3)-CH2-COOCH3. No, that's not correct. The structure is (Z)-COOCH3-CH=CH-COOCH3.

Wait, the double bond is between C1 and C2. So the substituents are COOCH3 on both ends. So, the molecule is symmetric, making it achiral. Therefore, no optical isomerism.

So, perhaps only compound 2 shows optical isomerism.

But looking back at the options, the only option that includes compound 2 is option A (1,2,4) and option D (1 and 2). Since I've concluded that 2 is yes, but 1 and 4 are no, then perhaps the correct answer is only 2. But the options don't have that.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake with compound 4. Let me think again: perhaps dimethyl fumarate isn't a meso compound.

Wait, another approach: if the substituents on the double bond are the same and the molecule is symmetric, then it's meso and not chiral. So, no optical isomerism.

So, in that case, only compound 2 shows optical isomerism.

But since the options don't have an option that includes only 2, perhaps the correct option is A, which includes 1,2,4. But I thought 1 and 4 don't exhibit optical isomerism.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake with compound 1. Let me think again.

Compound 1: dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate.

So, each ring has substituents at 2 and 6, which are opposite each other. Now, when connected via the biphenyl, could the arrangement of substituents lead to a chiral molecule?

Wait, perhaps the substituents on each ring are in such a way that the entire molecule is not symmetrical. For example, if the substituents on each ring are on the same side of the central bond, the molecule could be chiral.

Wait, but in a biphenyl system, substituents can rotate freely around the central bond unless they are bulky and hinder rotation. In that case, the molecule could adopt a conformation that is chiral.

But without knowing the steric hindrance, it's hard to say. Alternatively, perhaps the substituents are arranged in such a way that they create a non-superimposable mirror image.

Wait, but the substituents are at 2 and 6 on each ring. So if you rotate the rings, the substituents could be on the same side, leading to a chiral arrangement.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule has a plane of symmetry, making it achiral.

Hmm. I'm stuck. Since I can't be certain, perhaps I should go with the initial analysis.

Based on the earlier analysis, the only compound which shows optical isomerism is 2. But since the options don't have that, perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake with compound 4. Maybe dimethyl fumarate is a diastereomer, but not necessarily chiral.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm missing something. Another approach: the presence of a stereogenic center or a plane of symmetry.

Compound 4: dimethyl fumarate. The structure is (Z)-COOCH3-CH=CH-COOCH3. Since both substituents are same, the molecule is symmetric, so it's a meso compound. Therefore, no optical isomerism.

So, I'm back to only compound 2 showing optical isomerism.

But in the options, only option A includes 2 along with 1 and 4. If 2 is correct and 1 and 4 are incorrect, then the correct option would be only 2. But that's not present.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake with compound 1. Let me think again.

Compound 1: dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate.

If the substituents are arranged in a way that the molecule lacks a plane of symmetry, then it would be chiral.

But the substituents are at 2 and 6 on each ring, which are opposite each other. So, the molecule might have a plane of symmetry through the central bond, making it achiral.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituents are in a way that creates a chiral arrangement.

Wait, another thought: since each ring has two substituents, but they're on opposite sides, the molecule may have a plane of symmetry, making it achiral.

So compound 1: no.

So, I'm confident that only compound 2 shows optical isomerism.

But looking back at the options, none match. Therefore, perhaps I made a mistake in the analysis.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake with compound 4. Another approach: perhaps dimethyl fumarate has a chiral center.

But no, in dimethyl fumarate, the structure is (Z)-COOCH3-CH=CH-COOCH3. The central double bond has substituents on the same side, making the molecule symmetric, so no chiral centers.

So, the only one is compound 2.

But the options don't have an option with only 2. Therefore, perhaps the correct answer is option A, which includes compounds 1, 2, and 4. But I don't think 1 and 4 are correct.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake with compound 1. Let me think again.

Perhaps the substituents are in such a way that the molecule is chiral. For example, if the substituents on each ring are at 2 and 6, but their positions relative to the central bond cause the molecule to lack a plane of symmetry.

Wait, perhaps the substituents are arranged in a way that when placed on each ring, they create a chiral arrangement. For example, if the substituents are on the same side of the central bond, leading to no plane of symmetry.

But without seeing the structure, it's hard to say. Alternatively, perhaps the molecule is chiral.

If that's the case, then compound 1 would exhibit optical isomerism. Then, with compound 2, the answer would be option D (1 and 2).

But earlier, I thought compound 1 was symmetric, so no.

Hmm.

I think I'll have to go with the initial correct analysis: only compound 2 shows optical isomerism. But since none of the options match, perhaps the correct option is A (1,2,4). But I'm not confident.

Alternatively, perhaps I should look for which options include 2. The only options that include 2 are A, D.

In option A: 1,2,4.

In option D: 1,2.

If only 2 is correct, but that's not an option, perhaps the correct answer is A (1,2,4) is incorrect, so perhaps D is correct if 1 and 2 are correct.

But I don't think 1 is correct.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in thinking that compound 2 has a chiral center. Let me re-express.

Compound 2: methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate.

Structure: CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3.

The central carbon (the CH with OH) is attached to:

- CH3,

- OH,

- COOCH3,

- and another H.

Wait, no, that's not right. The structure is CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3.

So the central carbon is CH(OH), attached to:

- CH3,

- OH,

- COOCH3,

- and another H.

So four different substituents: CH3, OH, COOCH3, H. Therefore, it's a chiral center. So yes, it has optical isomerism.

So, only compound 2 is correct.

But since the options don't have that, perhaps the correct answer is option A (1,2,4) is incorrect, option D (1,2) is incorrect. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake with compound 4.

Wait, another thought: dimethyl fumarate is (Z)-dimethyl (2,2-difluorovinyl) something. No, that's not it.

Wait, perhaps dimethyl fumarate has a different structure which allows for optical isomerism.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the substituents are in such a way that the molecule isn't symmetric. For example, if the substituents are on different sides, leading to a chiral arrangement.

Wait, but in dimethyl fumarate, the substituents are COOCH3 on both ends, same on each side, so it's symmetric.

So, the molecule isn't chiral.

Therefore, I think the only correct answer is compound 2. But since the options don't have that, perhaps the intended answer is option A (1,2,4). But I don't think 1 and 4 are correct.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake with compound 4. Another approach: perhaps dimethyl fumarate has a different structure which creates a chiral center.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the double bond in dimethyl fumarate is between two different groups, leading to a chiral center. But I don't think so because both substituents are COOCH3.

Hmm.

In conclusion, the only compound that exhibits optical isomerism is number 2. Therefore, the correct option should include only 2. But since none of the options do, perhaps the intended answer is option A, but I'm not confident.

Wait, but the options provided are:

A) 1, 2 and 4

B) 3 and 4

C) 2 and 3

D) 1 and 2

Since I've concluded that only 2 is correct, but the options don't include that, perhaps the intended answer is option A.

But I think this is a mistake. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in my analysis.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake with compound 4. Let me think again.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the substituents in dimethyl fumarate are not the same, leading to optical isomerism.

Wait, no, both substituents are COOCH3, same on both sides.

Hmm.

I think I have to go with the conclusion that only compound 2 shows optical isomerism. But since the options don't reflect that, perhaps the intended answer is option A.

But I'm not confident. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option A.

Wait, but another possibility: perhaps compound 4 has a chiral center elsewhere.

Wait, dimethyl fumarate's structure is (Z)-COOCH3-CH=CH-COOCH3. The central carbon atoms are double-bonded, so no chiral centers there. The other carbons are CH2 groups, which aren't chiral.

So, no, compound 4 doesn't have any chiral centers.

Thus, the only correct answer is number 2. But since none of the options match, perhaps the intended answer is option A, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake with compound 1. Let me think again.

Compound 1: dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate.

Each ring has substituents at 2 and 6. So each ring has substituents in para positions relative to the central bond. Now, when you have two substituents in para positions on each ring, the molecule could have a plane of symmetry through the central bond. So it's achiral.

Therefore, no optical isomerism.

So, I think the correct answer is only compound 2. But since the options don't have that, perhaps the intended answer is option A, but I'm not confident.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option A, but I don't think so.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is option A, but I'm not sure. But given my analysis, I think only 2 is correct.

Wait, perhaps the correct option is option A, but I'm not confident.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake and the correct answer is option A.


To determine which compounds exhibit optical isomerism, we analyze each compound for the presence of a chiral center or another form of stereogenic element. Optical isomerism occurs when a molecule has non-superimposable mirror images, typically due to chirality.

### Analysis of Each Compound:

1. **Dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate**  
   This compound consists of two benzene rings connected by a single bond, with substituents at positions 2 and 6 on each ring. The substituents on each ring are opposite each other, and the molecule likely has a plane of symmetry through the central bond. This symmetry makes the molecule achiral, and thus it does not exhibit optical isomerism.

2. **Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**  
   The structure of this compound is CH₃-CH(OH)-COOCH₃. The central carbon (the one with the hydroxyl group) is attached to four different groups: CH₃, OH, COOCH₃, and H. This makes it a chiral center, and the molecule exhibits optical isomerism.

3. **Benzophenone**  
   Benzophenone has the structure (Ph)₂CO, where two phenyl groups are attached to a carbonyl group. The central carbon is double-bonded to oxygen and attached to two identical phenyl groups, making it symmetrical. Therefore, it does not exhibit optical isomerism.

4. **Dimethyl Fumarate**  
   Dimethyl fumarate is the cis isomer of dimethyl maleate, with the structure (Z)-COOCH₃-CH=CH-COOCH₃. The molecule is symmetric, with identical substituents (COOCH₃) on both sides of the double bond. This symmetry makes it a meso compound, and it does not exhibit optical isomerism.

### Conclusion:
From the analysis, only **compound 2 (methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate)** exhibits optical isomerism due to the presence of a chiral center. None of the other compounds have the necessary stereogenic elements for optical isomerism. However, none of the provided options match this conclusion exactly. Based on the given options, the closest match is **Option A (1, 2, and 4)**, though it is not entirely accurate.
