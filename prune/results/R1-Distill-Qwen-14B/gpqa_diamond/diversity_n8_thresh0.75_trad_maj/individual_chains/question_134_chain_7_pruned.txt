Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of these thermodynamics questions. But let's take it step by step. The question is about calculating the enthalpy of neutralization when mixing three different solutions: HCl, H2SO4, and Ba(OH)2. Hmm, I remember that neutralization reactions involve acids and bases reacting to form water and a salt, and the enthalpy change is usually exothermic.

First, I need to figure out what's happening when these three solutions are mixed. Let me write down the given data:

- 500 mL of 0.2 M HCl
- 300 mL of 0.3 M H2SO4
- 200 mL of 0.5 M Ba(OH)2

Wait, but wait. When mixing these, all three will react together. I'm a bit confused because I thought neutralization usually involves an acid and a base. But here, we have two acids and one base? Or is Ba(OH)2 the base and the HCl and H2SO4 the acids?

Right, HCl and H2SO4 are both acids, and Ba(OH)2 is a strong base. So when mixed, the acids will react with the base. But I need to find the stoichiometry of the reactions because I might have excess of one reactant, which would affect the calculation.

I know that the enthalpy of neutralization is typically calculated per mole of H+ reacting with OH-. Since the reaction releases heat, the enthalpy change will be negative.

Let me break it down. First, I should calculate the moles of H+ from each acid and the moles of OH- from the base.

For HCl: since it's a strong acid, it dissociates completely. HCl → H+ + Cl-. So moles of H+ from HCl = Molarity × Volume. Wait, the volume is in mL, so I'll convert it to liters. 500 mL is 0.5 L. So 0.2 M × 0.5 L = 0.1 moles of HCl → 0.1 moles H+.

H2SO4 is sulfuric acid. It's a strong acid but it's diprotic. Wait, but in solution, does it fully dissociate both H+ ions? For the purpose of neutralization, I think each mole of H2SO4 provides 2 moles of H+. So the formula would be H2SO4 → 2H+ + SO4^2-. So moles of H2SO4 are 0.3 M × 0.3 L = 0.09 moles. So H+ from H2SO4 is 0.09 × 2 = 0.18 moles.

Ba(OH)2 is a strong base. It dissociates into Ba^2+ and 2 OH^- ions. So each mole gives 2 moles of OH-. So moles of Ba(OH)2 = 0.5 M × 0.2 L = 0.1 moles. So OH- contributed is 0.1 × 2 = 0.2 moles.

Now, the total H+ is 0.1 + 0.18 = 0.28 moles. The OH- is 0.2 moles.

Wait, so H+ is more than OH-. So
