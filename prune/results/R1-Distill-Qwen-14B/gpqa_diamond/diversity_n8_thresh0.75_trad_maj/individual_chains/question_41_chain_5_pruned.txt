Okay, so I have this physics problem here about the speed of light in a moving glass medium. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's think it through.

The question says a light beam is going through glass with index of refraction n. The glass itself is moving at a constant velocity v in the same direction as the beam, and towards the observer in the lab. Wait, no, actually, the glass is moving toward the observer, but the beam is in the same direction as the glass's motion. Oh, I think I got that right.

The main question is about the speed of light in the glass relative to the observer in the lab. The options are A to D, and I need to figure out which is correct.

I remember that the speed of light in a medium is v_medium = c/n. But wait, that's the speed in the medium when the medium is stationary relative to the observer. But here, the glass is moving. So I guess I need to consider both the medium's motion and the light's speed in that medium.

Wait, is this a problem about combining velocities? Like, using the velocity addition formulas from special relativity? Because the glass is moving, and the light is inside it. But I'm not sure if relativity is required here. The problem says the speed of light in vacuum is c=1, which is a relativistic approach. But maybe since the problem is about a moving medium, perhaps we need to use the relativistic velocity addition formula.

Let me think. The speed of light in the glass is v_light = c/n. But the glass itself is moving at velocity v. So what's the speed of the light as seen by the lab frame?

Wait, maybe it's
