Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question is asking.

The problem is about finding the kinetic energy of the product particles in a certain decay process. The reaction given is Pi(+) decaying into mu(+) and a neutrino, which I assume is the nu here. Wait, neutrinos are tricky because they have such a small mass, but I think in these kinds of problems, we often treat them as massless. Or maybe the problem already accounts for that somehow.

The setup says that the Pi(+) is stationary. So, the pion is not moving initially, which probably means that the total momentum before decay is zero. That makes sense because the pion is at rest. Therefore, the products must have equal and opposite momenta so that their total momentum cancels out. So, the muon and the neutrino will have equal and opposite momenta. 

The rest masses are given. The pion has a rest mass of 139.6 MeV, and the muon has a rest mass of 105.7 MeV. The neutrino's rest mass is negligible, so I can consider it as zero for this calculation. That might make things easier.

I remember that in decay problems, energy and momentum are conserved. Since the pion is at rest, the total energy before decay is just its rest energy, which is 139.6 MeV. After decay, the total energy should be the sum of the energies of the muon and the neutrino. But wait, the neutrino is a lepton, so it's tricky, but maybe because it's massless, its energy is just pc.

So, let's denote the muon's energy as E_mu and the neutrino's as E_nu. The total energy after decay is E_mu + E_nu, and that should equal the initial energy, which is 139.6 MeV. So, equation one: E_mu + E_nu = 139.6 MeV.

For momentum, since the pion is at rest, the total momentum before decay is zero. So, the muon's momentum plus the neutrino's momentum must equal zero. That would mean their magnitudes are equal and opposite. So, let's say the muon's momentum is p, and the neutrino's is also p, but in the opposite direction. Wait, no, actually, the neutrino's momentum would be equal
