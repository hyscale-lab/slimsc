Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here about stellar abundances. Hmm, let me think. Alright, the question is about finding the ratio of silicon atoms in two stars compared to each other. Let me try to unpack this step by step.

First, let's read the problem again. So, there are two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. Each has a mass that's a bit more than the Sun: 1.5 and 1.2 times, respectively. But I'm not sure if the masses matter here; maybe it's just context. The key part is about their elemental abundances.

They give me some ratios using the EW (equivalent width) method. For Star_1, [Si/Fe]_1 is 0.3 dex, and [Fe/H]_1 is 0. For Star_2, [Mg/Si]_2 is 0.3 dex, and [Mg/H]_2 is 0. Oh, wait, and they also give the solar photospheric composition for Fe and Mg.

The solar values are 12 + log10(nFe/nH) = 7.5 and 12 + log10(nMg/nH) = 7. So I think that means the number density of Fe relative to H is 10^(7.5 - 12) = 10^(-4.5). Similarly for Mg, it's 10^(-5), because 7 -12 is -5. Wait, let me check: 12 + log(nFe/nH) =7.5 → log(nFe/nH)= -4.5 → nFe/nH = 1e-4.5.

But I'm being asked about the ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2. So, [Si/Star_1]/[Si/Star_2]? Or wait, no, the ratio is (nSi)_1 / (nSi)_2.

Hmm, to find the ratio, I think I need to express the silicon abundance in each star relative to hydrogen and then compare them.

Wait, but how do I get [Si/H] for each star? Because I have [Si/Fe] and [Fe/H] for Star_1. Similarly, for Star_2, I have [Mg/Si] and [Mg/H].

Let me think about Star_1 first.

Star_1: [Si/Fe] = 0.3. [Fe/H] = 0. So, [Fe/H]=0 means that the abundance of Fe relative to H is the same as in the Sun. So for Star_1, Fe is solar. Then, [Si/Fe] is 0.3, which means Si is 0.3 dex higher than Fe. So, [Si/H] = [Fe/H] + [Si/Fe] = 0 + 0.3 = 0.3 dex.

Wait, wait. The notation [X/Y] = log(nX / nY) - log(nX/nY)_sun. So for [X/Y], it's the logarithm of the ratio of X to Y relative to the solar ratio.

So, [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 → log(nSi/nFe)_1 / log(nSi/nFe)_sun = 0.3. So nSi/nFe in Star_1 is 10^(0.3) times that of the Sun.

But wait, [Fe/H]_1 is 0, which means log(nFe/nH)_1 = log(nFe/nH)_sun. So nFe/nH in Star_1 is the same as in the Sun. Let me get the Sun's nFe and nH.

From the problem, for the Sun: 12 + log(nFe/nH) =7.5 → log(nFe/nH) = -4.5 → nFe/nH = 1e-4.5. Similarly for Mg, nMg/nH = 1e-5.

So, Star_1 has [Fe/H] = 0 → nFe/nH = 1e-4.5.

Now, for Star_1, [
