Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The question is about treating racemic 3-methylpent-1-ene with Grubbs catalyst. I need to find out how many possible products there are, excluding ethene. The options are A)4, B)8, C)6, D)2.

Hmm, I remember Grubbs catalyst is used for olefin metathesis reactions. Metathesis is when the positions of the substituents on a double bond are swapped. Grubbs is good for ring-closing metathesis and also for cross metathesis, but in this case, since we have a single alkene, it's probably an internal metathesis or maybe a ring-opening if there's a ring, but wait, 3-methylpent-1-ene doesn't form a ring, so it's probably a simple olefin metathesis.

Wait, the starting material is racemic 3-methylpent-1-ene. Racemic means it's a 50-50 mixture of enantiomers. So the molecule has a chiral center. Let me draw the structure. Pent-1-ene means the double bond is between C1 and C2. So it's CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3. Wait, no, wait, wait. 3-methylpent-1-ene. Pent means five carbons. Position 1 is the first carbon, so the double bond is between C1 and C2. So the structure is CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3? Wait, no, wait. Let me count again.

Wait, pent-1-ene: the double bond starts at carbon 1. So it's CH2=CH-CH2-CH2-CH3? No, wait. 3-methyl would be on carbon 3. So, the structure is CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3? Wait, no, that's six carbons. Wait, no, pent is five carbons. So, perhaps it's CH2=CH-C(CH3)-CH2-CH3? No, because that's five carbons in a row. Wait, pent-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH2CH3, but with a methyl group on carbon 3.

So, the structure would be CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3? Wait, that's six carbons. Hmm
