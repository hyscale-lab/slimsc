Okay, so I've got this question about a Lagrangian and figuring out the mass dimension of κ and whether the theory is renormalizable. Hmm, I remember from my QFT class that renormalizability has to do with the dimensions of the coupling constants and the terms in the Lagrangian. Let me try to piece this together.

The given Lagrangian is L_int = κ ψ̄ σ_{μν} ψ F^{μν}. Oh wait, σ_{μν} is defined as (i/2)[γ_μ, γ_ν], right? So σ is an antisymmetric tensor made from the gamma matrices.

First, I need to find the mass dimension of κ. To do that, I should probably use the formula for mass dimensions. Remember, in 4-dimensional spacetime, the mass dimension is calculated based on the fields involved and the action being dimensionless.

Each field has a certain mass dimension. For fermions ψ, the dimension is 3/2 because the Dirac equation is first order in derivatives. So ψ has [ψ]_M = 3/2. Similarly, ψ̄ has the same dimension because it's just the adjoint.

Now, what about F^{μν}? F is the field strength tensor for electromagnetism or Yang-Mills, I think. The field strength F is defined as ∂μ Aν - ∂ν Aμ, where A is the gauge field. So each derivative adds one dimension. Since A has dimension 1 (because it's a gauge field, right?), then F would be dimension 2. Because each derivative is dimension 1, and A is 1, so each term in F has dimension 1+1=2.

So putting it together, the term ψ̄ σ_{μν} ψ F^{μν}.

Wait, let me calculate the dimension of each part. The σ_{μν} is made from the commutator of gamma matrices. The gamma matrices themselves are dimensionless, because they're just matrices, right? So σ_{μν} is dimensionless as well.

So the term becomes κ multiplied by ψ̄ (3/2) * σ (0) * ψ (3/2) * F (2). Let's add up the dimensions:

ψ̄: 3/2
σ: 0
ψ: 3/2
F: 2
So 3/2 + 3/2 is 3, plus 2 is 5.

Wait, but the Lagrangian must have mass dimension 4 in 4D, because the integral over d^4x makes the action dimensionless. The Lagrangian density must have dimension 4. So each term in the Lagrangian should have dimension 4.

Wait no, each term in the Lagrangian should have dimension 4. So the term κ ψ̄ σψ F must have dimension 4. Let me compute the sum of the dimensions of the fields in the term.

Each ψ has 3/2. ψ̄ is 3/2. F is 2. So 3/2 + 3/2 + 2 = 3 +2=5. So the product ψ̄ σ ψ F has dimension 5. But the Lagrangian term is κ times that, so κ must have dimension (4-5) = -1. Because the whole term needs to be dimension 4. So [κ]_M = -1.

So the first part of the question: the mass dimension of κ is -1. Looking at the options, options A and C say that. So the possible answers are A or C.

Now, the second part: is the theory renormalizable? For a theory to be renormalizable, all the coupling constants must have positive or zero mass dimension. Because in the renormalization process, the coupling's dimension determines the superficial degree of divergence. If a coupling has negative mass dimension, the interaction is not renormalizable, leading to a non-renormalizable theory.

Wait, wait, I'm a bit fuzzy on this. The mass dimension of the coupling is [g]_M. In 4D, a renormalizable theory requires that the coupling has a mass dimension greater than or equal to (d - (sum of fields in the term)/2). Or wait, another way: Each coupling's dimension must be ≥ (4 - n), where n is the number of fields in the term. Because the term in the Lagrangian has to have dimension 4.

Wait, another approach: The dimension of the coupling is determined by the requirement that the term has dimension 4. So for each term g φ1 φ2 ... φn, the dimension is [g] + sum [φi]_M =4.

In our case, the term is κ ψ̄ σψ F, which
