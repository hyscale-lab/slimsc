Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem to solve. Let's see what it's about. The question is about determining the molecular formula of a di-substituted aromatic compound based on its spectroscopic data. Alright, let's break it down step by step.

First, the compound is a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring. So, that's probably a benzene ring with two substituents attached. Di-substituted means two groups are on the benzene, right? So positions could be para, meta, or ortho.

The FTIR spectrum shows an ester group. Esters have a carbonyl group (C=O) which typically absorbs around 1740 cm⁻¹. Also, the ester group has an -O- in the structure, so that's something to note. So, the molecule likely has an ester functional group attached to the benzene ring.

Looking at the ¹H NMR data: there are six signals. Let's parse those. Two signals for aromatic-H. Each aromatic proton in a benzene ring usually appears as a singlet, doublet, or multiplet depending on neighboring protons. Since it's a di-substituted ring, the substitution pattern will affect the splitting. For example, para substitution would give two sets of equivalent protons, each as a singlet. But if the substituents are in the meta position, the protons could split into different patterns. Wait, but here it's two signals, so perhaps there are two distinct sets of aromatic protons. That could happen in a para-substituted benzene where each substituent is the same, but that might not be the case here. Alternatively, maybe the substituents are different, leading to two different sets of aromatic protons.

Then, two signals for vinyl-H. One is a doublet, the other a doublet of quartets. Vinyl protons are typically those attached to double bonds, like in alkenes. So, maybe the substituents include some double bonds. For example, an ester group might be connected via an alkene. Wait, but wait, an ester is R-O-CO-O-R? No, wait, ester is RCOOR'. Oh right, so the ester group is a carbonyl connected to an OR' group. So, if the substituent is an ester, perhaps it's connected via a vinyl group. Alternatively, maybe the substituents are something else, but with vinyl protons.

Wait, or perhaps the substituents themselves have vinyl groups. Like, perhaps one substituent is an ester and another is an ethylene group or something with a double bond. Alternatively, maybe each substituent has a vinyl group. Hmm, no, but the NMR says two signals for vinyl-H, so maybe each substituent has a vinyl proton, but in different environments.

Wait, but the NMR shows two signals: one doublet and one doublet of quartets. So, perhaps there are two different types of vinyl protons. A doublet suggests each proton is next to one other proton (maybe adjacent in a double bond). A doublet of quartets could mean each proton is next to a group that has four neighboring protons. But wait, quartet is four peaks, so that could be coupling with another group. Alternatively, perhaps it's a vinyl group adjacent to an oxygen, as in an ester group.

Wait, maybe the substituent is an ester group attached via a methylene group (like CH2), but that's not possible because the NMR says there are no CH2 signals. Hmm, that's an important point. The NMR shows no signals corresponding to CH2 groups, so any CH2 groups in the molecule would have to be equivalent or perhaps in a symmetric environment, or perhaps they aren't present at all. Wait, but the substituents may have branching or not.

Wait, the problem says two signals for vinyl-H. So maybe the substituent includes a vinyl group, such as a substituent like an ester attached through a CH2CH2 group, but that would have CH2 groups, which are not present in the NMR. Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a vinyl ester, like an allyl ester. Hmm, vinyl ester would have a structure like CH2=CHCOOR, but wait, that would give some
