Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem in front of me. Let's take it step by step. Hmm, the question is about identifying a compound X based on its reaction product's NMR spectra. The reaction involves 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane in a nonpolar solvent at 403 K for a day. I remember that this reagent is often used for epoxide ring-opening reactions, especially in nonpolar solvents. Oh wait, maybe it's a ring-opening via acid catalysis? Or maybe it's a different kind of reaction.

So, the product's 1H and 13C NMR data are given. Let's look at the 1H NMR first. The signals are:

δ 2.28 (3H, s), 2.31 (3H, s), 6.75 (1H, d), 7.08 (2H, d), 7.68 (1H, d), 7.71 (2H, d).

Wait, so there are two singlets integrating to 3H each. That probably means two methyl groups. Where would they be attached? Maybe on aromatic rings or as substituents.

Looking at the aromatic region, there are three doublets. The downfield shifts suggest some substitution. Let me think: in aromatic protons, a doublet usually means coupling with one neighboring proton. But in this case, we have multiple doublets. Hmm, maybe it's a para-substituted benzene ring with adjacent substituents. Or perhaps it's a styrene-type structure.

Wait, the 13C NMR might help. The 13C data is:

δ 21.3 (s, 1C), 28.4 (s, 1C), 126.9 (s, 2C), 127.1 (s, 1C), 129.1 (s, 2C), 130.3 (s, 1C), 141.5 (s, 1C), 144.1 (s, 1C), 197.7 (s, 1C).

Wait, 197.7 is a very high shift. That's probably a carbonyl group, maybe an epoxide? Or perhaps a ketone. But wait, the reaction is with a bicyclic amine, which is a strong base. Oh wait, 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane is a commonly used base for epoxide ring-opening, but in this case, wait, maybe it's acting as a base. Oh, but in the reaction, if compound X is an epoxide, then reacting with this base might not open it, unless it's under acidic conditions. Hmm, maybe I'm getting this wrong.

Wait, another thought: 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane is a strong, non-nucleophilic base. So in what reactions does it participate? Oh, right! It's used in the Corey-Fuchs reaction, but more relevantly, in epoxide ring-opening when using a strong base, but wait, sometimes the base can deprotonate something else. Alternatively, maybe this is an acid-catalyzed reaction, but that's less likely given the reagent.

Alternatively, maybe the reaction is an acid-mediated process, but given the solvent is nonpolar, like maybe THF or something else. Alternatively, perhaps the reagent is acting as a base for a ring-opening of an epoxide. Hmm.

Wait, let me think about the product's structure. If the product has an epoxide ring, does the NMR support that? Wait, looking at the 13C data, the 197.7 ppm is a carbonyl. Oh, wait, no, wait. Wait, epoxide carbons are around 50-70 ppm, I think. 197 is way higher. So maybe that's a ketone or another carbonyl group. Hmm.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the compound has an ester or ketone group. Let's see. But looking at the 1H NMR, there's no obvious ester protons. Wait, but the 13C NMR has a peak at 197.7, which is more in line with a ketone or an aldehyde. But an aldehyde would have a proton around δ 9-10, which the 1H NMR doesn't show. So maybe a ketone.

Wait, but what else? Let's think about the possible structures of the options.

The options are:
A) 2-(4-methylstyryl)oxirane
B) 2-(1-phenylprop-1-en-2-yl)oxirane
C) 2-methyl-3-styryloxirane
D) 2-styrylepoxide

Wait, all options except perhaps option B are epoxides. Because the names include 'oxirane' or 'epoxide'. So the product is an epoxide, and the reaction is perhaps a ring-opening followed by something else? Or maybe the product is an epoxide, so the starting material is something else.

Wait, wait. The reaction conditions are 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane, which is a strong base, in nonpolar solvent at 403 K (which is about 130°C). So if the starting material is an epoxide, perhaps it's undergoing a ring-opening reaction. But if the product is another epoxide, then maybe the reaction is something else, like a rearrangement or a ring-forming reaction.

Wait, but the product's 13C NMR has a 197.7, which is a carbonyl. Hmm. So maybe the product is not an epoxide but something else. Wait, but let's think again. The options are for compound X, the starting material. So the product is the result of reaction of X with this base. So perhaps X is an epoxide, and the product is after ring-opening.

Wait, let me think. Let me look at each option and see what structure they have and what reaction they undergo.

Option A: 2-(4-methylstyryl)oxirane. So it's an oxirane (epoxide) with a substituent: 4-methylstyryl. The structure would be a styryl group attached to the epoxide ring. The styryl group is a vinyl group attached to a benzene ring, and the 4-methyl part means a methyl group on the benzene at the para position.

Option B: 2-(1-phenylprop-1-en-2-yl)oxirane. That would be a propenyl group attached to the epoxide ring, with a phenyl group on the same carbon as the double bond. So something like a cyclohexene ring attached to the epoxide, but with a phenyl substituent.

Option C: 2-methyl-3-styryloxirane. So the epoxide has a methyl group and a styryl group attached. Wait, the numbering is 2 and 3. So the epoxide ring is between carbons 2 and 3, with a methyl on 2 and a styryl on 3.

Option D: 2-styrylepoxide. That would be an epoxide where one of the carbons is attached to a styryl group. So the structure would be styryl-CH2-O-CH2-? No, wait, styryl is a vinyl group attached to a benzene. So it's a ep
