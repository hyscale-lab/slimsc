Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem to solve, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think through it step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

We have a solution with a volume of 200.00 cm³, which is 0.2 liters. The solution contains 1.00 g of KH2PO4 and 1.00 g of Na2HPO4·2H2O. I need to find the concentration of orthophosphate ions (PO4^3-) in this solution.

Wait, orthophosphate is HPO4^2-, right? No, wait, no. Orthophosphate is PO4^3-, but in solution, it can dissociate further. Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me clarify. H3PO4 is the triprotic acid. It can lose three protons:

1. H3PO4 → H+ + H2PO4^- (Ka1)
2. H2PO4^- → H+ + HPO4^2- (Ka2)
3. HPO4^2- → H+ + PO4^3- (Ka3)

So orthophosphate is PO4^3-. But wait, in solution, these ions are in equilibrium. So the question is asking about [PO4^3-], which is the concentration of the fully deprotonated form.

But wait, wait. Another thought: the salts KHP (KH2PO4) and Na2HPO4 are being added. So each of these salts will dissociate into ions in solution. Let's think about that.

KH2PO4 dissociates into K+ and H2PO4^-.

Na2HPO4·2H2O: when it dissolves, the formula is Na2HPO4. So it dissociates into 2 Na+ and HPO4^2-.

So, in the solution, we have H2PO4^- from KH2PO4 and HPO4^2- from Na2HPO4.

These are conjugate base pairs. Since H2PO4^- can act as an acid (donate a proton) to become HPO4^2-, and HPO4^2- can act as a base (accept a proton) to become PO4^3-.

But wait, since both are present, perhaps they form a buffer solution. Hmm, but how does that affect the concentration of PO4^3-?

Wait, the problem is about orthophosphate, which is PO4^3-.

So I need to find [PO4^3-] in the solution.

But the solution contains H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- from the two salts. How do these affect each other?

I think I should first calculate the concentrations of each of the salts in the solution.

Let me compute the moles of each component.

First, the mass of each is 1.00 g for both KH2PO4 and Na2HPO4·2H2O.

Compute moles = mass / molar mass.

For KH2PO4 (Mw =136.09 g/mol
