Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about astronauts moving at relativistic speeds. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on relativity, but let's see if I can figure this out. The question is about finding the relative speed between the two astronauts and the total energy of the system.

Alright, the problem says: two astronauts with masses 2m and 3m are moving at 0.6c and 0.5c respectively in the positive x-direction. They want the relative speed and the total energy.

Wait, so the first part is about relative speed. I remember that when dealing with speeds close to the speed of light, you can't just subtract them normally because that would give a speed greater than c, which is impossible. Oh right, you have to use the relativistic velocity addition formula.

The formula for relative velocity when two objects are moving along the same direction is something like (u - v)/(1 - (uv/c²)). Let me get that right. So u is the speed of one object relative to the other, and v is the speed of the other object relative to the same frame.

Wait, wait. Let me clarify: let's say astronaut A is moving at 0.6c, and astronaut B at 0.5c. We want the speed of A as seen from B's frame. So u (A's speed) is 0.6c, and v (B's speed in the same frame) is 0.5c. So the relative speed of A with respect to B would be (0.6c - 0.5c)/(1 - (0.6c * 0.5c)/c²).

Wait, let me calculate the denominator. (0.6 * 0.5) c² over c² is 0.3. So denominator becomes 1 - 0.3 = 0.7. The numerator is 0.1c. So the relative speed is (0.1c)/(0.7) = approximately 0.142857c. So about 0.14c. So that would make the relative speed option either C or D. Because options C and D have 0.14c.

Now, the second part is the total energy of the system. Wait, each astronaut has their own rest mass and kinetic energy, right? But wait, the problem says 'total energy of the system'. So I think it's the sum of their relativistic energies.

The relativistic energy of each is gamma times mc². So for each astronaut, calculate their gamma and multiply by their mass
