Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me read through the question again and try to break it down step by step.

The problem starts with 1,3-dibromoadamantane. I remember adamantane is a diamondoid structure, kind of a cage-like molecule. The dibromo suggests there are two bromine atoms attached to adjacent carbons, probably in the 1 and 3 positions.

Heating this with excess KOH at 240°C. KOH is a strong base, so maybe it's an elimination reaction. Since there are two bromine atoms, perhaps it's a double dehydrohalogenation. When you eliminate two HBr molecules, you usually form an alkene. But wait, in the product, the 1H NMR shows a peak at 4.79 ppm (2H), which is around where an -OH group would be, but maybe it's something else. Alternatively, a carbonyl group would have a peak in that region too. Wait, the IR shows a peak at 1720 cm⁻¹, which is a strong carbonyl (C=O) stretch. That suggests the product might be a ketone.

Wait, how does elimination of HBr from 1,3-dibromoadamantane lead to a ketone? Oh, wait, perhaps it's a neighboring group elimination. Alternatively, maybe it's a dehydrohalogenation followed by another elimination. Alternatively, maybe the base abstracts a proton, leading to the formation of a double bond, but in adamantane, the structure is so rigid that forming a double bond might not be feasible, so perhaps instead, it's a pinacol-like rearrangement. Wait, another possibility: when two adjacent dihalides undergo elimination with a strong base, they can form a ketone. Ah, right! The formation of a ketone via a double elimination. So 1,3-dibromoadamantane would eliminate two HBr molecules to form a ketone. So product 1 would be 1,3-diketone adamantane? Wait, no, wait. Let me think. 1,3-dibromoadamantane would have Br on carbons 1 and 3. Upon dehydrohalogenation, each Br would leave, abstracting a β-hydrogen from adjacent carbons. So for each Br, a double bond would form (but in adamantane, the structure is rigid, so maybe this leads to a ring expansion or something else). Alternatively, each elimination could form a double bond, but perhaps in the case of 1,3-dibromo, two eliminations would form a ketone. Oh wait, wait! The pinacol mechanism is when vicinal diols lose water to form ketones. But in this case, we have vicinal dibromides. When treated with a strong base, perhaps the two Brs are eliminated, leading to the formation of a carbonyl group. So, maybe the product is adamantanedione, which is a ketone at both 1 and 3 positions. But wait, no, because if 1 and 3 are both carbonyls, that might be a possibility.

Wait, but the NMR of product 1 shows a singlet at 4.79 ppm for 2H. Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps it's an epoxide. Wait, no, because epoxides typically have protons around 3.5-4.5 ppm, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, could it be a geminal diol? No, because KOH is a base, and heating would eliminate, not add water. So perhaps the product is a ketone, and the NMR shows the adjacent protons.

Wait, another approach. Let's think about the reaction: 1,3-dibromoadamantane + KOH (excess) → product 1. The IR shows a carbonyl, so it's a ketone. So the product is likely a diketone. But wait, 1,3-dibromoadamantane is a 1,3-dihalo compound. Elimination of two HBr would give a diene? But in adamantane, that's not possible due to the structure. Alternatively, perhaps it's a double elimination to form a ketone on each adjacent carbon. Wait, but in 1,3-dibromoadamantane, the two Brs are on adjacent carbons? No, wait, the numbering is 1 and 3, which are adjacent in the adamantane structure. So upon elimination of two HBr, each Br would form a double bond, but perhaps with the structure, they form a ketone.

Wait, perhaps each Br is on a bridgehead, and elimination forms a bridgehead ketone. Alternatively, the product is a single ketone. Let me think again. Let's imagine the structure. Adamantane has a structure where each bridgehead is a carbon connected to two other bridgeheads. So 1,3-dibromoadamantane has Br at two bridgeheads, perhaps. When you eliminate two HBr, you form a double bond between the two bridgeheads. But wait, bridgehead double bonds are not very stable because of the Bredt's rule, which states that double
