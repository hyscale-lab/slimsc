Okay, so I've got this question about organic chemistry, specifically dealing with Grubbs catalyst and racemic compounds. Let me try to break it down step by step.

First, the question says that racemic 3-methylpent-1-ene is treated with Grubbs catalyst. I remember that Grubbs catalyst is used in olefin metathesis reactions. So, metathesis is when the positions of substituents in a carbon-carbon double bond are exchanged. It can either be ring-closing, ring-opening, or cross metathesis. 

The compound given is 3-methylpent-1-ene. Let me draw the structure. Pent means five carbons. The double bond is between C1 and C2. So the structure is CH2=CH-C(CH3)-CH2-CH3. Wait, no, wait. Wait, 3-methylpent-1-ene. So the double bond is between 1 and 2, and the third carbon has a methyl group. So the structure is CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3. Hmm, but wait, pent-1-ene, so positions are 1,2,3,4,5. So the structure should be CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3.

Wait, but wait, wait. Let me count again. Pent has five carbons. Position 1 is the first carbon. So: 1 has a double bond to 2. So the structure is CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3. That makes sense. 

Now, the compound is racemic. Racemic means it's a 50:50 mixture of enantiomers. So in this case, the double bond is in the first position, and the substituents around the double bond are different. So each enantiomer would have the substituents on opposite sides. But wait, in this case, the double bond is between C1 and C2. The C1 is CH2, and C2 is CH-... Wait, no. Let me think again.

Wait, the structure is CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3. So the double bond is between C1 and C2. So C1 has two H's and one CH2 group. C2 has two H's and a CH group connected to CH(CH3) and then the rest. Wait, no, perhaps I should draw it better. The structure is:

CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3.

So the double bond is between
