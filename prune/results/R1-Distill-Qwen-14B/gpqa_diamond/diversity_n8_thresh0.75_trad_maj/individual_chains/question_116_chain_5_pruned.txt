Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of these NMR problems and reaction mechanisms. Let me take it step by step.

The question starts with Compound A, which has a proton NMR showing two signals. The first is a triplet at 0.9 ppm for 6H, and the second is a quartet at 1.3 ppm for 4H. I remember that in NMR, the integration tells us how many protons are present. So 6H and 4H in two different environments.

Hmm, the triplet at 0.9 ppm probably indicates a set of equivalent protons adjacent to another set. Triplet usually comes from a neighboring group with two protons. So maybe something like two CH2 groups next to each other. Wait, 6H as a triplet... Oh, maybe it's two equivalent CH2 groups each next to another CH2. Like maybe a di-substituted ethyl group? Or perhaps a cyclohexane derivative?

Wait, another thought: if it's a triplet for 6H, that could mean three equivalent CH2 groups. Wait, no. Wait, if it's a triplet at 0.9, that's probably two sets of CH2 groups. Wait, maybe it's a -CH2CH2(CH2CH3) group or something else.

Wait, but another possibility: the triplet at 0.9 ppm is from six equivalent protons. So maybe three sets of two protons each. Wait, maybe it's a diethyl group? No, because diethyl would give more signals. Alternatively, perhaps it's a cyclopropane or something, but I'm not sure.

Wait, let me think again. The triplet at 0.9 ppm is for 6H. Let's say each set of 3H is a triplet. Wait, no. Wait, 6H as a triplet: the integration is 6H, so maybe it's a -CH2CH2CH2- group, but that would be a triplet, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe it's a methyl group adjacent to a CH2. For example, a -CH2CH(CH3)2 structure? No, wait. If there are six equivalent protons as a triplet, maybe two methyl groups (CH3) each next to a CH2 group. So like CH2CH2CH3? No, that's not right.

Wait, perhaps it's a cyclohexane ring with two substituents. Like maybe a 1,3-dimethylcyclohexane or something. But I'm not sure how that would show up in the NMR.

Alternatively, another thought: the triplet at 0.9 ppm for 6H suggests that those protons are each next to two other equivalent protons. So maybe each group is a CH2 connected to another CH2. Like perhaps two ethyl groups attached to the same carbon? Wait, if you have a structure like CH2CH2CH3 attached in two places, but that might not fit.

Wait, another angle: the quartet at 1.3 ppm for 4H. Quartet would imply each of those protons is next to a group with three equivalent protons. So 4H as a quartet. Hmm. If it's a CH2 adjacent to a CH(CH2CH3) group, but I'm not sure.

Wait, maybe
