Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about organic chemistry, specifically regarding optical isomerism. Hmm, optical isomerism, right. I remember that optical isomerism occurs when a compound has chiral centers, meaning they are non-superimposable mirror images. So, the question is asking which of the given compounds show optical isomerism. Let me go through each option one by one.

The options are 1 to 4, and the choices are A, B, C, D with different combinations.

First, let me recall what each type of isomer implies. Optical isomerism is a type of stereoisomerism, which includes enantiomers and diastereomers. So, the compounds must have stereogenic centers or some kind of stereoisomerism.

Let's look at each compound:

1. dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate.
Wait, the structure is a biphenyl system. The substituents are on positions 2 and 2' (the carboxylate groups) and 6 and 6' (the nitro groups). Since it's a biphenyl, the two benzene rings are connected by a single bond. The substituents on each ring are arranged in such a way that perhaps the molecule has a plane of symmetry or not.

Wait, if the substituents are in positions 2 and 2' on each ring, that's para positions for each ring. The nitro groups are at 6 and 6', which are adjacent to the connecting bond. Wait, no, the positions on biphenyl are numbered such that the connecting point is position 1 on each ring. So, 1 is the bridge, 2 is next to it on each ring. So 6,6' would be the opposite side, if the rings are connected at 1 and 1'.

So, in the case of a biphenyl system, if the substituents are in such a way that the molecule lacks a plane of symmetry, would that lead to optical isomerism? Because biphenyls can have atropisomerism, which is a form
