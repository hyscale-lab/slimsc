Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question is asking.

The problem is about finding the uncertainty ΔP_z of the operator P_z. I remember that the uncertainty is calculated using the formula ΔP_z = sqrt(⟨P_z²⟩ - ⟨P_z⟩²). So I need to find the expectation values of P_z and P_z squared for the given state.

The system is in an eigenstate of P_x with eigenvalue -ħ. The state is given as a column vector: (-1/2, 1/√2, -1/2). The basis vectors are the eigenvectors of P_z, which suggests that the state is already expressed in the eigenbasis of P_z. That's probably helpful because it means when we measure P_z, the state is a linear combination of the eigenstates of P_z.

Wait, but wait. The state is an eigenstate of P_x, not P_z. So when I measure P_z, the possible outcomes are the eigenvalues of P_z, which are probably ±ħ for the first and third basis vectors, and 0 for the second. But I'm not sure, let me check the matrix for P_z.

Looking at P_z's matrix: it's diagonal with elements (ħ, 0, -ħ). So the eigenvalues are ħ, 0, -ħ for the respective basis vectors. The basis vectors are eigenvectors, so each corresponds to these eigenvalues.

The state is a vector ψ = [ -1/2, 1/√2, -1/2 ]^T. Let me verify if this is normalized. The sum of the squares of the absolute values should be 1.

Calculating: (-1/2)^2 is 1/4, (1/√2)^2 is 1/2, and (-1/2)^2 is another 1/4. Adding them: 1/4 + 1/2 + 1/4 = (1 + 2 + 1)/4 = 4/4 =1. So it's normalized. Good.

Now, to find ⟨P_z⟩, I need to compute the expectation value of P_z in this state. Since the basis is that of P_z, the expectation value is just the sum of the probabilities multiplied by their eigenvalues.

Each component of the state is the amplitude for the corresponding eigenstate. So the probability for each eigenvalue is the square of the absolute value of the component.

So, the first component is -1/2: probability is (1/2)^2 = 1/4. Eigenvalue ħ → contributes (1/4)*ħ.

Second component is 1/√2: probability is (1/√2)^2 = 1/2. Eigenvalue 0 → contributes 0.

Third component is -1/2: probability 1/4. Eigenvalue -ħ → contributes (1/4)*(-ħ).

So ⟨P_z⟩ = (1/4)ħ + 0 + (1/4)(-ħ) = (1/4 - 1/4)ħ = 0. Hmm, that's interesting. So the expectation value is zero.

Next, I need ⟨P_z²⟩. Since P_z is diagonal, P_z squared is just the squares of the diagonal elements. So for each eigenstate, the square is (ħ)^2, 0^2, (-ħ)^2 → which are ħ², 0, and ħ².

So the expectation value ⟨P_z²⟩ is the sum of (probability)*(eigenvalue squared) for each state.

Calculating each term:

First component: (1/4)*ħ².

Second component: (1/2)*0 → 0.

Third component: (1/4)*ħ².

Adding them: (1/4 + 1/4) ħ² = (2/4) ħ² = (1/2) ħ².

So ⟨P_z²⟩ is (1/2) ħ².

Now, ΔP_z is sqrt(⟨P_z²⟩ - (⟨P_z⟩)^2) = sqrt( (1/2 ħ² ) - 0 ) = sqrt( (1/2) ħ² ) = ħ * sqrt(1/2) = ħ / sqrt(2).

Looking at the options, option B is ħ / sqrt(2), which matches. So the answer should be B.


To determine the uncertainty $\Delta P_z$ of the operator $P_z$, we use the formula:

\[
\Delta P_z = \sqrt{\langle P_z^2 \rangle - \langle P_z \rangle^2}.
\]

### Step 1: Compute $\langle P_z \rangle$
The state of the system is given as the column vector $\psi = \begin{pmatrix} -1/2 \\ 1/\sqrt{2} \\ -1/2 \end{pmatrix}$. The basis vectors are the eigenvectors of $P_z$, and the eigenvalues of $P_z$ are $\hbar$, $0$, and $-\hbar$, corresponding to the first, second, and third basis vectors, respectively.

The expectation value $\langle P_z \rangle$ is calculated as:

\[
\langle P_z \rangle = \sum_i |c_i|^2 \cdot \lambda_i,
\]

where $c_i$ are the components of $\psi$ and $\lambda_i$ are the eigenvalues of $P_z$. The probabilities $|c_i|^2$ are:

- For the first component: $| -1/2 |^2 = 1/4$,
- For the second component: $| 1/\sqrt{2} |^2 = 1/2$,
- For the third component: $| -1/2 |^2 = 1/4$.

Thus:

\[
\langle P_z \rangle = \left(\frac{1}{4}\right)(\hbar) + \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)(0) + \left(\frac{1}{4}\right)(-\hbar) = \frac{\hbar}{4} - \frac{\hbar}{4} = 0.
\]

### Step 2: Compute $\langle P_z^2 \rangle$
The operator $P_z^2$ is the square of the diagonal matrix $P_z$, so its diagonal elements are $\hbar^2$, $0$, and $\hbar^2$. The expectation value $\langle P_z^2 \rangle$ is:

\[
\langle P_z^2 \rangle = \sum_i |c_i|^2 \cdot \lambda_i^2.
\]

Using the probabilities $|c_i|^2$ and the eigenvalues squared:

- For the first component: $\left(\frac{1}{4}\right)(\hbar^2) = \frac{\hbar^2}{4}$,
- For the second component: $\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)(0) = 0$,
- For the third component: $\left(\frac{1}{4}\right)(\hbar^2) = \frac{\hbar^2}{4}$.

Thus:

\[
\langle P_z^2 \rangle = \frac{\hbar^2}{4} + 0 + \frac{\hbar^2}{4} = \frac{\hbar^2}{2}.
\]

### Step 3: Compute $\Delta P_z$
The uncertainty is:

\[
\Delta P_z = \sqrt{\langle P_z^2 \rangle - \langle P_z \rangle^2}.
\]

Substituting the values:

\[
\Delta P_z = \sqrt{\frac{\hbar^2}{2} - 0^2} = \sqrt{\frac{\hbar^2}{2}} = \frac{\hbar}{\sqrt{2}}.
\]

### Final Answer:
The uncertainty $\Delta P_z$ is $\frac{\hbar}{\sqrt{2}}$, which corresponds to option **B**.

Answer: B
