Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because stoichiometry and titration can get a bit tricky. Let me try to break it down step by step.

Alright, the problem says we have 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid. We dilute it with 20.00 cm³ of water. Then we titrate this solution with 0.1 M NaOH. The question is asking for the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point. The options are A through D, each giving two pH values.

First, I think I should figure out what the concentration of the acetic acid solution is after dilution. Because when you mix two volumes, the concentration changes. Oh wait, right, dilution formula: M1V1 = M2V2.

So initially, the volume is 20 cm³, and the concentration is 0.05 M. After adding 20 cm³ of water, the total volume is 40 cm³. Let me compute the new concentration.

M2 = (M1 * V1) / V2. Plugging in the numbers: M2 = (0.05 M * 20 cm³) / 40 cm³. That's (1) /40 = 0.025 M. So the diluted acetic acid concentration is 0.025 M.

Wait, but wait, acetic acid is a weak acid, so it doesn't completely dissociate. But during the titration, when we add NaOH, which is a strong base, it will react with the acetic acid. The reaction should be: CH3COOH + NaOH → CH3COO^-Na+ + H2O.

So, at 25% titration, how much NaOH has been added? The equivalence point is when all the acetic acid has been neutralized. So to find the equivalence point volume, I can compute moles of acetic acid initially and then find the volume of NaOH needed.

Moles of acetic acid before dilution: Molarity × Volume = 0.05 M * 20 cm³. Wait, but volume in liters. Oh right, 20 cm³ is 0.02 L. So 0.05 * 0.02 = 0.001 moles.

Wait, no! Wait, wait. Oh, when you dilute, the moles change? No, wait, no. Because when you dilute, you're just adding more solvent, so the number of moles stays the same. Oh, wait, no, wait: no, wait, the acetic acid solution is 20 cm³ of 0.05 M. Moles = 0.05 * 0.02 L = 0.001 mol. Then, when diluted to 40 cm³, the concentration is 0.025 M, but the moles remain 0.001 mol. Right, because dilution doesn't change the number of moles, just the concentration.

So the equivalence point is when moles of NaOH added equal moles of acetic acid. So moles NaOH needed is 0.001 mol. The concentration of NaOH is 0.1 M. So volume of NaOH at equivalence is (moles) / (Molarity) = 0.001 / 0.1 = 0.01 L, which is 10 cm³.

So that's the equivalence point. So at 25% titration, we've added 25% of the NaOH needed to reach equivalence. So 25% of 10 cm³ is 2.5 cm³. So 2.5 cm³ of 0.1 M NaOH. Let's compute moles of NaOH added: 0.1 M * 0.0025 L = 0.00025 mol.

So the reaction between acetic acid and NaOH is 1:1, so this amount of NaOH will neutralize 0.00025 mol of acetic acid. So initial moles of acetic acid: 0.001 mol. After adding NaOH, moles of CH3COOH left: 0.001 - 0.00025 = 0.00075 mol. Moles of acetate ion (CH3COO^-) formed: 0.00025 mol.

Now, the total volume of the solution at this point is the initial solution plus the added NaOH. Initial solution after dilution is 40 cm³. Adding 2.5 cm³ of NaOH brings it to 42.5 cm³, which is 0.0425 L.

So for the 25% titration, we can treat this as a buffer solution. So we can use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation: pH = pKa + log([A^-]/[HA]).

The pKa is given by -log(1.85e-5). Let me compute that. Let's see, 1.85e-5 is approximately the Ka. So pKa is about 4.735 (because log(2e-5 is 4.7, and 1.85 is a bit less than 2, so maybe around 4.74 or 4.73). Alternatively, precise calculation: log(1.85) is about 0.267, so 1.85e-5 is 5.0 - 0.267 = 4.733, so pKa is about 4.73.

So pH = 4.73 + log( (0.00025 / 0.0425) / (0.00075 / 0.0425) ). Wait, the concentrations are in terms of moles per liter, but since the volume is the same for both (because [A^-] and [HA] are in the same solution), the volume cancels out. So it's log( (0.00025) / (0.00075) ) = log(1/3) ≈ -0.477.

So pH ≈ 4.73 - 0.477 ≈ 4.253. So approximately 4.25. Looking at the options, option A is 4.26; option D is 4.57. So for the first part, 25% titration, pH is around 4.25, so option A or D.

Now, what about the equivalence point? At equivalence, all the acetic acid has been neutralized, so the solution is a solution of sodium acetate. Sodium acetate is a salt of a weak acid and strong base, so it will hydrolyze in water to form a basic solution.

So the concentration of acetate ions in solution can be calculated. The moles of acetate are 0.001 mol (since all the acetic acid was neutralized). The total volume is 40 cm³ (diluted acetic acid) + 10 cm³ (NaOH) = 50 cm³ = 0.05 L.

So concentration of acetate is 0.001 / 0.05 = 0.02 M.

The hydrolysis reaction is CH3COO^- + H2O ↔ CH3COOH + OH^-.

The Kb for this reaction is Kw / Ka = (1e-14) / (1.85e-5) ≈ 5.405e-10.

So Kb = 5.405e-10. The concentration of acetate is 0.02 M. We can set up the expression:

Kb = [CH3COOH][OH^-] / [CH3COO^-].

Assuming x is the [OH^-] produced, and x is small because Kb is small, so:

x² / 0.02 ≈ 5.405e-10 → x² ≈ 5.405e-10 * 0.02 = 1.081e-11 → x ≈ sqrt(1.081e-11) ≈ 1.04e-5 M.

So [OH^-] is about 1.04e-5 M. The pOH is -log(1.04e-5) ≈ about 4.98. So pH is 14 - 4.98 = 9.02.

Wait, but wait. Let me double-check the Kb. Let's compute it more accurately. Ka is 1.85e-5. Kb is 1e-14 / 1.85e-5 = (1 / 1.85) * 1e-9 = approximately 0.54054 * 1e-9 = 5.4054e-10. Correct.

So Kb is 5.4054e-10. So the calculation is correct. So [OH^-] is sqrt(0.02 * 5.4054e-10) = sqrt(1.08108e-11) ≈ 1.04e-5. pOH is about 4.98, pH ≈ 9.02.

But wait, none of the options have a pH around 9 at equivalence. The options are A:8.52, B:6.73, C:7.00, D:6.92.

Hmm, that's a problem. Because according to my calculation, equivalence point pH should be around 9.02, but the options don't include that. So perhaps I've made a mistake somewhere.

Wait a minute. Oh wait, let me think again. Maybe I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me recompute the [OH^-].

Wait, the Kb is 5.405e-10, and the concentration is 0.02 M. So x² / 0.02 = 5.405e-10 → x² = 0.02 *5.405e-10 = 1.081e-11 → x = sqrt(1.081e-11) ≈ 1.04e-5. So [OH^-] is 1.04e-5, pOH is about 4.98, pH is 9.02. That's right.

But none of the options match. So perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the volume or moles.

Wait, let me check the equivalence point.

At equivalence point, the total volume is 40 cm³ (diluted acetic acid) + 10 cm³ (NaOH) = 50 cm³. Moles of acetate: 0.001 mol.

Concentration of acetate: 0.001 / 0.05 L = 0.02 M. Correct.

Wait, but maybe I should consider activity coefficients or something else? Probably not. That's beyond the scope for a basic problem.

Wait, wait another thought: perhaps the problem asks for the pH at 25% of the titration. So 25% of the equivalence point volume. So if the equivalence point is 10 cm³, then 25% is 2.5 cm³. So that's what I used earlier. So that part is correct.

Wait, but maybe the dilution of the solution when adding the NaOH is a factor. Let me think. When you add 2.5 cm³ of NaOH to the 40 cm³ solution, total volume is 42.5 cm³, which affects the concentration of the buffer. But I think I accounted for that correctly in the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation.

Wait, perhaps the initial concentration of acetic acid after dilution is correct? Let's recheck that.

Initial volume is 20 cm³ of 0.05 M. Moles are 0.05 * 0.02 = 0.001 mol. The diluted solution is 40 cm³, so 0.001 / 0.04 L = 0.025 M. Correct.

So why is the equivalence pH not matching any options? Let me look at the options:

Option D: pH at equivalence point is 6.92. That's way lower than my calculation. So maybe I made a mistake in the equivalence point calculation.

Wait, perhaps I forgot that sodium acetate is a strong electrolyte and completely dissociates. So the acetate ion concentration is 0.02 M. But wait, acetate ion is a weak base. So the solution is basic, which would give a pH above 7, which none of the options have.

Wait, looking at the options again:

A) 4.26; 8.52

B) 3.17; 6.73

C) 4.73; 7.00

D)4.57;6.92

So the equivalence points are 8.52, 6.73, 7.00, 6.92. All of them are below 7, which can't be right because sodium acetate should be basic.

So perhaps my mistake is in the approach for the equivalence point. Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the initial moles.

Wait, the diluted solution is 40 cm³ of 0.025 M acetic acid. So moles are 0.025 * 0.04 = 0.001 mol. Then, at equivalence, moles of NaOH added is 0.001 mol. So the volume of NaOH is 0.001 / 0.1 = 0.01 L = 10 cm³. So that's correct.

Wait, but maybe at equivalence, the solution is sodium acetate, but perhaps I'm calculating the pH incorrectly.

Wait, perhaps I should have considered the autoionization of water or something else. Let me re-calculate the pH at equivalence point.

The acetate ion (A^-) undergoes hydrolysis:

CH3COO^- + H2O ↔ CH3COOH + OH^-

The Kb is Kw / Ka = (1e-14)/(1.85e-5) ≈ 5.405e-10.

The initial concentration of acetate is 0.02 M. Let me set up the ICE table:

Initial: [A^-] = 0.02 M; [CH3COOH] = 0; [OH^-] = 0.

Change: -x; +x; +x.

Equilibrium: [A^-] = 0.02 - x ≈ 0.02 (since x is small), [CH3COOH] = x, [OH^-] = x.

So Kb = (x)(x) / (0.02) ≈ x^2 / 0.02 = 5.405e-10 → x^2 = 1.081e-11 → x = sqrt(1.081e-11) ≈ 1.04e-5 M.

So [OH^-] is 1.04e-5 M → pOH = log(1/1.04e-5) = log(9.615e4) → wait, no, wait. pOH is -log(1.04e-5) ≈ 4.98 → pH = 14 - 4.98 = 9.02.

So why don't any options have a pH around 9? Maybe I made a mistake in the problem setup. Let me read the question again.

Wait, the problem says we dilute 20 cm³ 0.05 M acetic acid with 20 cm³ water. Then titrate with 0.1 M NaOH. So the initial solution is 40 cm³ of 0.025 M acetic acid.

Wait, perhaps the initial concentration is different. Let me recheck.

Wait, 20 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid is 0.05 mol/L * 0.02 L = 0.001 mol. When diluted to 40 cm³, concentration is 0.001 / 0.04 = 0.025 M. Correct.

So perhaps the mistake is in the calculation of the equivalence point's pH. Alternatively, perhaps the question is about the pH at 25% of the initial acetic acid concentration, not 25% of the equivalence point volume. Wait, the question says "25% titration", which typically refers to 25% of the equivalence point volume.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that the solution at equivalence is a buffer? No, that's not it.

Wait, but the options don't have a pH above 7 for the equivalence point. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait another thought: maybe the problem is not about the equivalence point but about the halfway point. Wait, at the halfway point (which is when half of the acetic acid has been neutralized), the pH equals the pKa. So that's 4.73. Which is one of the options, like option A and C have pH 4.73 as equivalence point.

Wait, but that's not the case. At equivalence, it's a solution of the conjugate base. At halfway point, which is when half the acid has been neutralized, the solution is a buffer with equal concentrations of acid and conjugate base, so pH = pKa. But that would be at 50% titration, not 25%.

Wait, but in the problem, the first part is 25% titration, which is earlier than halfway.

Wait, perhaps the mistake is in my initial assumption about the behavior of the buffer. Let me recheck the 25% titration.

At 25% titration, I added 2.5 cm³ of 0.1 M NaOH. Moles of NaOH: 0.1 * 0.0025 L = 0.00025 mol.

Moles of acetic acid initially: 0.001 mol. After reaction: 0.001 - 0.00025 = 0.00075 mol. Moles of acetate: 0.00025 mol.

The total volume is 40 + 2.5 = 42.5 cm³ = 0.0425 L.

So [HA] = 0.00075 / 0.0425 = 0.017647 M.

[ A^- ] = 0.00025 / 0.0425 = 0.005882 M.

So applying Henderson-Hasselbalch:

pH = pKa + log([A^-]/[HA]) → pKa is 4.73.

log(0.005882 / 0.017647) → that's log(0.333) ≈ -0.477.

So pH = 4.73 - 0.477 ≈ 4.253. Rounded to 4.25, which matches option A's first value of 4.26.

Now, looking at the options, option A has pH values 4.26 and 8.52. But I thought the equivalence pH is around 9.02, but option A has 8.52. So why is that?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the equivalence point calculation. Let me re-examine.

Wait, perhaps the initial moles of acetic acid are different. Wait, the problem states that 20 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid is diluted with 20 cm³ of water. So 0.05 M * 0.02 L = 0.001 mol. Correct.

At equivalence, all 0.001 mol of acetic acid is neutralized, producing 0.001 mol of acetate. The total volume is 40 + 10 = 50 cm³ → 0.05 L. So concentration of acetate is 0.001 / 0.05 = 0.02 M.

Kb = 5.405e-10.

So [OH^-] = sqrt(0.02 * 5.405e-10) → let me compute that again.

0.02 * 5.405e-10 = 1.081e-11 → sqrt(1.081e-11) ≈ 1.04e-5.

pOH = -log(1.04e-5) ≈ 4.98 → pH = 14 - 4.98 = 9.02.

But none of the options have this. So is there a mistake in the calculation?

Wait, perhaps the problem is using a different approach for the equivalence point. Alternatively, maybe I'm missing a factor in the calculation, like activity coefficients, but that's unlikely for this level.

Alternatively, perhaps I miscalculated Kb. Let me compute Kb again.

Ka = 1.85e-5 → Kw is 1e-14 at 25°C. So Kb = (1e-14)/(1.85e-5) → 1e-14 / 1.85e-5 = (1 / 1.85) * 1e-9 = approximately 0.54054 * 1e-9 = 5.405e-10. Correct.

Wait, perhaps I should use a more precise value for pKa. Let me compute it accurately.

Ka = 1.85e-5 → pKa = -log(1.85e-5) → log(1.85) is approximately 0.267. So pKa ≈ 4.733.

So the pH at 25% is 4.26 as in option A.

Now, looking again at the equivalence point. If none of the options have a pH around 9, perhaps the problem expects us to use an approximation for the pH at equivalence point. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the problem setup.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the problem isn't using the correct approach for the equivalence point. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using the formula for a buffer at equivalence, but that's not possible.

Wait, maybe the user made a typo in the options, but I can't change that. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the equivalence point calculation. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps the solution at equivalence is sodium acetate, which has a pH greater than 7. But the options don't have that. So perhaps the correct answer isn't among the options, but that's unlikely. So perhaps my mistake is somewhere else.

Wait, perhaps the initial moles are different. Let me recheck.

Wait, the initial solution is 20 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid → 0.05 * 0.02 = 0.001 mol. Then, after adding 20 cm³ of water, the volume is 40 cm³, so concentration is 0.001 / 0.04 = 0.025 M. Correct.

Equivalence point is when all 0.001 mol of acetic acid has reacted, requiring 0.001 mol of NaOH (0.1 M → 10 cm³). So that's correct.

So perhaps the problem expects me to find the pH using a different method or perhaps I made a mistake in the assumption about the hydrolysis.

Wait, perhaps the solution is not as I thought. Let me try another approach. The concentration of acetate is 0.02 M. Let's consider the hydrolysis equation:

CH3COO^- + H2O ↔ CH3COOH + OH^-

The Kb is 5.405e-10. So, the expression is Kb = [CH3COOH][OH^-] / [CH3COO^-].

Assuming [OH^-] is x, then [CH3COOH] is x, and [CH3COO^-] is 0.02 - x ≈ 0.02.

So Kb ≈ x² / 0.02 → x² = 0.02 * 5.405e-10 → x² = 1.081e-11 → x = 1.04e-5 M.

So [OH^-] is 1.04e-5 → pOH is about 4.98 → pH is 9.02.

Hmm, no, that's still the same result. So perhaps the options are incorrect, but that's unlikely.

Wait, perhaps the mistake is in the way the problem is set up. Let me think again.

Wait, the problem says that after diluting, we titrate the resulting solution with 0.1 M NaOH. So the initial solution is 40 cm³ of 0.025 M acetic acid.

Wait, the titration is with 0.1 M NaOH. So the equivalence point occurs when moles of NaOH added equals moles of acetic acid.

Moles of acetic acid = 0.001 mol. So moles of NaOH needed = 0.001 mol. Volume = moles / Molarity = 0.001 / 0.1 = 0.01 L → 10 cm³. Correct.

So, the solution at equivalence is 0.02 M acetate in 50 cm³ → 0.05 L. So [CH3COO^-] is 0.02 M. Correct.

So, why is the calculated pH at equivalence around 9.02, but none of the options match?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the way I calculated the pH. Let me compute the pH using the exact expression without assuming x is negligible.

The Kb expression is:

Kb = (x)(x + y) / (0.02 - x) → but this complicates things. Alternatively, perhaps using the exact quadratic equation.

Wait, Kb = x² / (0.02 - x) = 5.405e-10.

Assuming x is much smaller than 0.02, so 0.02 - x ≈ 0.02. So the earlier approximation holds. x ≈ 1.04e-5. So pOH is 4.98 → pH 9.02.

Wait, but perhaps the problem is using a different value for Kw. No, Kw is 1e-14 at 25°C.

Hmm, perhaps the problem is expecting me to use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation at equivalence, which isn't applicable because all the acetic acid is converted to acetate. So the buffer equation doesn't work here; only the hydrolysis of acetate is relevant.

Wait, perhaps I should re-calculate the pH at equivalence using the exact equation.

So, Kb = [CH3COOH][OH^-] / [CH3COO^-] = 5.405e-10.

Let [OH^-] = x. Then [CH3COOH] = x. [CH3COO^-] = 0.02 - x.

So,

x² / (0.02 - x) = 5.405e-10.

Assuming x is small, 0.02 - x ≈ 0.02 → x² = 0.02 * 5.405e-10 → x ≈ 1.04e-5. So same as before.

So perhaps the problem expects a different approach, or perhaps the options are wrong. But since the options don't include 9.02, maybe I made a mistake in another part.

Wait, perhaps I should check the equivalence point calculation again. Let me think: moles of acetic acid after dilution is 0.001 mol. So moles of NaOH needed is 0.001 mol. So the volume is 0.001 / 0.1 = 0.01 L → 10 cm³. So that's correct.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering the dilution of the NaOH into the solution. Wait, the total volume at equivalence is 40 +10 =50 cm³, correct. So acetate concentration is 0.02 M.

Wait, perhaps I should use the exact formula without approximation. Let's compute x without assuming x is negligible.

x² = 5.405e-10 * (0.02 - x) → x² + 5.405e-10 x - (0.02 *5.405e-10) =0.

This is a quadratic equation: x² + 5.405e-10 x - 1.081e-11 =0.

Using quadratic formula:

x = [-b ± sqrt(b² +4ac)]/(2a)

a=1, b=5.405e-10, c= -1.081e-11.

Discriminant D = (5.405e-10)^2 +4 *1*(1.081e-11) ≈ 2.921e-19 +4.324e-11 ≈ approx 4.324e-11.

sqrt(D) ≈ sqrt(4.324e-11) ≈ 6.575e-6.

So x = [ -5.405e-10 ± 6.575e-6 ] / 2.

We take the positive root: (6.575e-6 - 5.405e-10) /2 ≈ (6.575e-6)/2 = 3.2875e-6. Wait, but wait, 6.575e-6 is 0.000006575, and 5.405e-10 is negligible compared to that. So x ≈ 3.2875e-6.

Wait, this gives [OH^-] as 3.2875e-6, which would make pOH = about 5.48, so pH=8.52.

Ah! So this gives a pH of 8.52 at equivalence. Which matches option A's second value.

Wait, but why did the approximation give a different result? Because when we don't neglect x in the denominator, the result changes. Let me see.

Wait, earlier, I neglected x in the denominator and assumed 0.02 - x ≈0.02. But when I include x, the result is different.

So, plugging the numbers, the quadratic approach gives x ≈ 3.2875e-6 M.

So [OH^-] =3.2875e-6 M → pOH = -log(3.2875e-6) ≈ 5.48 → pH=14-5.48=8.52.

Ah, so that's the 8.52 in option A.

Wait, but why did the approximation give a different value? Because the assumption that x is negligible compared to 0.02 isn't valid here.

Wait, x is 3.2875e-6 M, and 0.02 is 2e-2, which is 2e-2 = 20e-3. 3.2875e-6 is 0.0032875e-3. So 0.0032875 compared to 20 → 0.016% of 0.02. So x is about 0.016% of 0.02, which is indeed negligible. So why does the quadratic solution give a different result? There must be a mistake in the quadratic approach.

Ah, perhaps I made a mistake in setting up the quadratic equation.

Wait, when I set up the equation without approximation, I have:

x² = Kb * (0.02 - x) → x² + Kb x - (Kb * 0.02) =0.

Wait, but when solving the quadratic equation, the standard form is ax² + bx + c=0. Here, the equation is x² + (Kb) x - (Kb * 0.02) =0. So, a=1, b=Kb=5.405e-10, c= -0.02 *5.405e-10 = -1.081e-11.

So the quadratic formula is correct.

Wait, let me recompute the discriminant.

D= b^2 -4ac = (5.405e-10)^2 -4 *1*(-1.081e-11) = (2.921e-19) + (4.324e-11) ≈ 4.324e-11.

So sqrt(D)= sqrt(4.324e-11) ≈ 6.575e-6.

So,

x = [ -5.405e-10 ± 6.575e-6 ] / (2*1).

Taking the positive root:

x = (6.575e-6 - 5.405e-10) / 2 ≈ (6.575e-6)/2 ≈3.2875e-6.

So [OH^-] is 3.2875e-6 → pOH≈5.48 → pH=8.52.

So the pH at equivalence is approx 8.52.

So this matches option A: 4.26; 8.52.

Now, why did the earlier approximation give a higher pH? Because in that approach, I assumed x was negligible, but it's not, despite being small. Wait, but 3.28e-6 is much smaller than 0.02, but when I include it in the denominator, it affects the calculation.

Wait, perhaps the approximation is not as valid as I thought. Let me compute the denominator as 0.02 - x and see.

If x is 3.2875e-6, then 0.02 - x is 0.0199967125. Close to 0.02, but perhaps the exact calculation gives a slightly lower [OH^-], leading to a lower pH.

Hmm, but wait, the exact solution gives a higher x, which would imply higher [OH^-], but wait, in the exact solution, x is 3.2875e-6, which is larger than the approximated 1.04e-5. Wait, no, 3.2875e-6 is 0.32875e-5, which is smaller than 1.04e-5. So the exact solution gives a lower x, hence lower [OH^-], leading to higher pH.

Wait, no: no, wait, 3.28e-6 is smaller than 1.04e-5, so [OH^-] is 3.28e-6, which leads to a higher pH (since [OH^-] is lower, pH is higher).

Wait, no, lower [OH^-] means lower pOH, higher pH.

Wait, [OH^-] is 3.28e-6 → pOH is about 5.48 → pH=8.52.

Earlier approximation gave [OH^-] as 1.04e-5 → pOH≈4.98 → pH≈9.02.

But according to the exact calculation, the [OH^-] is 3.28e-6, which is lower than the approximation. So the pH is higher.

Wait, wait, no. If [OH^-] is higher, pH would be lower. Wait, no, [OH^-] is 3.28e-6 is less than 1e-5. So lower [OH^-] than 1e-5 → higher pH than 9. So how does that reconcile with the exact solution giving pH 8.52?

Ah, I think I made a mistake in the exact solution. Let me recompute.

Wait, when I computed x in the quadratic equation, I got x≈3.2875e-6. So [OH^-] is 3.2875e-6 → which is 3.2875e-6 M.

Then, pOH is -log(3.2875e-6) → log(3.2875e-6) is about 5.48 (since log(3.2875) is about 0.517, so log(3.2875e-6)=0.517 -6= -5.483. So pOH=5.483 → pH=14-5.483=8.517, which rounds to 8.52.

So that's correct. So the exact solution gives pH 8.52, which matches option A.

So now everything makes sense. At 25% titration, the pH is 4.26, and at equivalence, it's 8.52. So the correct answer is option A.

Wait, but I initially thought the exact solution would give a lower pH, but I see I was wrong. So the correct answer is A.


To solve the problem, we first determine the concentration of acetic acid after dilution. Initially, 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid contains:

\[
\text{Moles of acetic acid} = 0.05 \, \text{M} \times 0.02 \, \text{L} = 0.001 \, \text{mol}.
\]

After diluting with 20.00 cm³ of water, the total volume is 40.00 cm³ (0.04 L). The new concentration is:

\[
\text{Concentration after dilution} = \frac{\text{Moles}}{\text{Volume}} = \frac{0.001}{0.04} = 0.025 \, \text{M}.
\]

### At 25% Titration
At 25% titration, 25% of the equivalence point volume has been reached. The equivalence point occurs when all 0.001 mol of acetic acid is neutralized by 0.1 M NaOH:

\[
\text{Volume of NaOH at equivalence} = \frac{\text{Moles of NaOH}}{\text{Molarity of NaOH}} = \frac{0.001}{0.1} = 0.01 \, \text{L} = 10 \, \text{cm}^3.
\]

At 25% titration, 2.5 cm³ of 0.1 M NaOH has been added. The moles of NaOH added are:

\[
\text{Moles of NaOH} = 0.1 \, \text{M} \times 0.0025 \, \text{L} = 0.00025 \, \text{mol}.
\]

This neutralizes 0.00025 mol of acetic acid, leaving:

\[
\text{Moles of acetic acid remaining} = 0.001 - 0.00025 = 0.00075 \, \text{mol}.
\]

The moles of acetate ion (\( \text{CH}_3\text{COO}^- \)) formed are:

\[
\text{Moles of acetate} = 0.00025 \, \text{mol}.
\]

The total volume of the solution is:

\[
\text{Total volume} = 40.00 \, \text{cm}^3 + 2.5 \, \text{cm}^3 = 42.50 \, \text{cm}^3 = 0.0425 \, \text{L}.
\]

The concentrations of acetic acid and acetate ion are:

\[
[\text{CH}_3\text{COOH}] = \frac{0.00075}{0.0425} = 0.01765 \, \text{M}, \quad [\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^-] = \frac{0.00025}{0.0425} = 0.00588 \, \text{M}.
\]

Using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation:

\[
\text{pH} = \text{pKa} + \log \left( \frac{[\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^-]}{[\text{CH}_3\text{COOH}]} \right),
\]

where \( \text{pKa} = -\log(1.85 \times 10^{-5}) \approx 4.73 \). Substituting the values:

\[
\text{pH} = 4.73 + \log \left( \frac{0.00588}{0.01765} \right) = 4.73 + \log(0.333) \approx 4.73 - 0.477 = 4.25.
\]

Thus, the pH at 25% titration is approximately **4.26**.

### At Equivalence Point
At the equivalence point, all 0.001 mol of acetic acid has been neutralized, forming 0.001 mol of acetate ion (\( \text{CH}_3\text{COO}^- \)). The total volume of the solution is:

\[
\text{Total volume} = 40.00 \, \text{cm}^3 + 10.00 \, \text{cm}^3 = 50.00 \, \text{cm}^3 = 0.05 \, \text{L}.
\]

The concentration of acetate ion is:

\[
[\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^-] = \frac{0.001}{0.05} = 0.02 \, \text{M}.
\]

The acetate ion hydrolyzes in water:

\[
\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^- + \text{H}_2\text{O} \leftrightarrow \text{CH}_3\text{COOH} + \text{OH}^-.
\]

The equilibrium constant for this reaction is the base dissociation constant \( K_b \), where:

\[
K_b = \frac{K_w}{K_a} = \frac{1.0 \times 10^{-14}}{1.85 \times 10^{-5}} \approx 5.405 \times 10^{-10}.
\]

Let \( [\text{OH}^-] = x \). The equilibrium concentrations are:

\[
[\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^-] = 0.02 - x \approx 0.02, \quad [\text{CH}_3\text{COOH}] = x, \quad [\text{OH}^-] = x.
\]

Substituting into the \( K_b \) expression:

\[
K_b = \frac{x^2}{0.02}.
\]

\[
x^2 = K_b \cdot 0.02 = (5.405 \times 10^{-10})(0.02) = 1.081 \times 10^{-11}.
\]

\[
x = \sqrt{1.081 \times 10^{-11}} \approx 3.29 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{M}.
\]

The pOH is:

\[
\text{pOH} = -\log(3.29 \times 10^{-6}) \approx 5.48.
\]

The pH is:

\[
\text{pH} = 14 - \text{pOH} = 14 - 5.48 = 8.52.
\]
