Okay, I need to figure out how many possible organic products result when 1-bromobenzene-2-d is treated with NaNH2 in a condensed ammonia solvent. Hmm, let's break this down.

Wait, first, what's 1-bromobenzene-2-d? Oh, right, that's bromobenzene with a deuterium (d) somewhere. Oh wait, 2-d probably means the deuterium is on the second carbon. So the structure is benzene with a bromine on carbon 1 and a deuterium on carbon 2. So adjacent positions.

Now, NaNH2 in ammonia is a strong base, right? I remember that NaNH2 is used for dehydrohalogenation or elimination reactions. But wait, in aromatic substitution, maybe it's a different context. Oh wait, no, benzene rings are usually pretty stable, but with substituents, the reactions can vary.

Wait, in this case, bromobenzene. Normally, benzene is pretty unreactive, but substituents can activate or deactivate the ring. Bromine is an electron-withdrawing group, so it's a meta-directing group. But wait, we're dealing with a substitution reaction here?

Wait, no. Wait, the reaction is with a strong base. Maybe it's not about aromatic substitution but about elimination. Oh wait, but benzene rings are generally not involved in elimination reactions unless it's a side chain. Wait, 1-bromo-benzene has a bromine attached directly to the ring. Hmm.

Wait, wait, another possibility: perhaps this is a case where the deuterium is involved in a hydrogen/deuterium exchange? Or maybe the base is abstracting a proton adjacent to the bromine, leading to elimination.

Wait, deuterium is a hydrogen isotope, so maybe the base (like NH2-) abstracts a proton next to Br, which is on the ring. Wait, but the ring is aromatic, so the positions are fixed. Let me think: the structure is benzene with Br at position 1 and deuterium at position 2.

So the ring has Br on C1 and D on C2. Now, treating with NaNH2 in NH3 (a strong base, deprotonating). But where can the base abstract a proton? Maybe the base is abstracting a proton from the ring, which is adjacent to the bromine. That would be the C2 position, but there's a D there. Hmm, so maybe the base abstracts the D? No, wait, deuterium is less acidic than regular hydrogen, but in aromatic rings, acidity can be influenced by substituents.

Wait, but in any case, when a base abstracts a proton adjacent to a leaving group (like Br), it can lead to elimination, forming a double bond. But benzene is a six-membered ring, so if we lose H and Br, would that form a diene? Wait, maybe that's not possible because benzene is already conjugated.

Wait, let me think again. The molecule is 1-bromo-2-deutero-benzene. So, para positions are 1 and 3, but here we have 1 and 2 as adjacent.

Wait, the base could abstract a proton from the ring adjacent to the bromine. So in this case, the available positions are perhaps C2 and C6? But C2 has a deuterium. So if the base abstracts a proton from C6, which is adjacent to Br at C1, then elimination could occur, removing Br and forming a double bond between C1 and C2? Wait, that would form a di-substituted benzene with a double bond.

Wait, but benzene is already fully conjugated. Oh, wait, perhaps this is a case of forming a benzene ring with a substituent that's part of a double bond, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the reaction is about dehydrohalogenation, leading to a diene, but in a benzene ring, that's not straightforward.

Alternatively, maybe this is a case of aromatic
