Okay, so I've got this question about stars and their effective temperatures based on the excitation of iron atoms in their photospheres. Hmm, let's think about what I remember.

The question says that the iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited as those in star_2. Oh wait, no, wait. It says the energy levels are twice as excited. Wait, actually, the exact wording is that the iron atoms in star_1's photosphere are twice as excited in a specific energy level. But I think in terms of excitation, it's about the number of atoms in a higher energy state compared to a lower one. So maybe the ratio of excited atoms to unexcited is higher in star_1.

Wait, I think the Boltzmann equation comes into play here. The Boltzmann distribution relates the relative populations of different energy states in a system in thermal equilibrium, which is what LTE (Local Thermal Equilibrium) implies.

The Boltzmann equation is something like the ratio of the number of atoms in two energy states is equal to the exponential of the negative energy difference divided by (k*T), where k is Boltzmann's constant and T is the temperature.

So the formula is n2/n1 = exp( - (E2 - E1)/(k T) )

In this problem, the energy difference between the levels is given as ΔE = 1.38e-23 J. Let's call E2 - E1 = ΔE.

Now, the question states that the excitation is twice as much in star_1 compared to star_2. Wait, wait. Let me make sure I get this right. So for star_1, the number of excited atoms is twice that of star_2. Or is it that in star_1, the ratio of excited to unexcited is twice as much as in star_2? Or perhaps it's the other way around? Wait, the problem says "iron atoms in the photosphere of star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level when compared to star_2." So perhaps for each atom, the excitation is higher? Or maybe the ratio of excited atoms to the ground state is higher in star_1.

Wait, I think the first scenario is that the ratio (n_upper / n_lower) is higher in star_1. So for star_1, n_upper_1 / n_lower_1 = 2 * (n_upper_2 / n_lower_2). Wait, no, the problem says that the excitation is twice as excited. So maybe the excitation parameter (like the population ratio) for star_1 is twice that of star_2. So n_upper_1 / n_lower_1 = 2 * (n_upper_2 / n_lower_2). Or perhaps it's the other way around. Wait, let me think.

Wait, maybe the excitation is such that the ratio (n_upper/n_lower) for star_1 is twice that of star_2. So (n_upper_1/n_lower_1) = 2*(n_upper_2/n_lower_2). Alternatively, maybe the excitation is twice as much in star_1, which would mean that (n_upper_1/n_lower_1) = 2*(n_upper_2/n_lower_2). Or perhaps the other way around? Wait, the problem states that the atoms in star_1 are twice as excited. So maybe the ratio is higher in star_1. So (n_upper_1)/(n_lower_1) = 2*(n_upper_2)/(n_lower_2).

Wait, but alternatively, maybe the excitation potential is such that the number of excited atoms is higher. So for star_1, (n_upper_1)/(n_lower_1) = 2 * (n_upper_2)/(n_lower_2). Or perhaps in star_1, the ratio is larger than in star_2 by a factor of two.

But I'm not entirely sure about that. Let me try to model this.

Let me denote the ratio for star_1 as R1 and for star_2 as R2. So R1 = n_upper_1 / n_lower_1, and R2 = n_upper_2 / n_lower_2.

The problem states that R1 is twice as excited as R2. So R1 = 2 * R2.

Wait, but wait. The question says "iron atoms in the photosphere of star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level when compared to the iron atoms in star_2." Hmm, perhaps that means that the excitation is higher, so the ratio R1 is higher than R2 by a factor of two. So R1 = 2 R2.

But wait, according to the Boltzmann equation, each ratio R is proportional to exp(-ΔE/(k T)).

So R = exp( -ΔE/(k T) ).

Wait, wait, no. The Boltzmann factor is (n_upper)/(n_lower) = exp( -ΔE/(k T) ), right? Because E_upper is higher than E_lower, so the exponential is negative.

So for star_1: R1 = exp( -ΔE/(k T1) )

For star_2: R2 = exp( -ΔE/(k T2) )

So according to the problem, R1 = 2 * R2.

So substituting:

exp( -ΔE/(k T1) ) = 2 * exp( -ΔE/(k T2) )

Take the natural logarithm of both sides:

-ΔE/(k T1) = ln(2) + [ -ΔE/(k T2) ]

Rearranging:

-ΔE/(k T1) + ΔE/(k T2) ) = ln(2)

Factor out ΔE/(k):

ΔE/(k) [ 1/(T2) - 1/(T1) ) ] = ln(2)

Hmm, let's see. Let me write this as:

ΔE/(k) ( (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) ) = ln(2)

Because 1/T2 - 1/T1 = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2 )

So:

ΔE/(k) * (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) ) = ln(2)

Wait, but what do we know about ΔE? It's given as 1.38e-23 J, but I don't think the actual value is needed here because it's given and the equation seems to involve T1 and T2. The question is about the equation relating T1 and T2.

Wait, but in the problem statement, the only given is the energy difference and the excitation ratio. The options are in terms of ln(2) being equal to something involving T1 and T2.

So looking back at the equation I derived:

ΔE/(k) * (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) ) = ln(2)

But since the problem says that the energy difference is given, perhaps the exact value of ΔE can be used or perhaps it's a constant. Alternatively, perhaps the equation can be rearranged to express ln(2) as (T1-T2)/(T1 T2) multiplied by some constant.

But the options don't include any constants except for ln(2) on the left. So perhaps the equation is supposed to be ln(2) equals (something involving T1 and T2).

Wait, let me double-check the derivation.

We have R1 = 2 R2.

R1 = exp(-ΔE/(k T1)).

R2 = exp( -ΔE/(k T2) ).

So R1/R2 = 2 = exp( -ΔE/(k T1) + ΔE/(k T2) )

Which is exp( ΔE/(k) (1/(T2) - 1/(T1)) )

Take ln of both sides: ln(2) = ΔE/(k) (1/T2 - 1/T1 )

Which can be written as ΔE/(k) * (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) ) = ln(2)

So that's the equation we have.

Now, looking at the options, which one matches this structure.

Option D: ln(2) = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2)

But wait, in our equation, it's ln(2) = [ΔE/(k)] * (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2)

So unless ΔE/(k) is 1, which I don't think it is. Let's compute ΔE/(k):

ΔE is 1.38e-23 J.

k is Boltzmann's constant, approximately 1.38e-23 J/K.

So ΔE/(k) = (1.38e-23 J) / (1.38e-23 J/K) ) = 1 K.

Wait! So that's a key point. Because ΔE is given as 1.38e-23 J, which is exactly equal to k (since k is 1.38e-23 J/K). So ΔE = k.

So substituting, ΔE/(k) = 1.

So our equation becomes ln(2) = (T1 - T2) / (T1 T2 )

Which is exactly option D.

So the correct equation is option D: ln(2) = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2).


The problem involves determining the relationship between the effective temperatures of two stars (T₁ and T₂) based on the excitation of iron atoms in their photospheres. The Boltzmann equation, which describes the ratio of populations of atoms in two energy states, is central to the analysis:

\[
\frac{n_{\text{upper}}}{n_{\text{lower}}} = \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{k T}\right),
\]

where \( \Delta E \) is the energy difference between the states, \( k \) is Boltzmann's constant, and \( T \) is the temperature. For star_1 and star_2, the ratios of excited to unexcited atoms are denoted as \( R_1 \) and \( R_2 \), respectively. The problem states that \( R_1 = 2 R_2 \), meaning the excitation is twice as high in star_1 compared to star_2.

Substituting the Boltzmann equation for each star:

\[
R_1 = \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{k T_1}\right), \quad R_2 = \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{k T_2}\right).
\]

Since \( R_1 = 2 R_2 \), we have:

\[
\exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{k T_1}\right) = 2 \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{k T_2}\right).
\]

Taking the natural logarithm of both sides:

\[
-\frac{\Delta E}{k T_1} = \ln(2) - \frac{\Delta E}{k T_2}.
\]

Rearranging terms:

\[
\frac{\Delta E}{k} \left(\frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1}\right) = \ln(2).
\]

Factoring the term in parentheses:

\[
\frac{\Delta E}{k} \cdot \frac{T_1 - T_2}{T_1 T_2} = \ln(2).
\]

The energy difference \( \Delta E \) is given as \( 1.38 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J} \), and Boltzmann's constant \( k \) is \( 1.38 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J/K} \). Thus, \( \Delta E / k = 1 \, \text{K} \). Substituting this into the equation:

\[
\frac{T_1 - T_2}{T_1 T_2} = \ln(2).
\]

This matches the form of option D: 

\[
\ln(2) = \frac{T_1 - T_2}{T_1 T_2}.
\]

Thus, the correct equation for the effective temperatures of the stars is:

**Answer: D**
