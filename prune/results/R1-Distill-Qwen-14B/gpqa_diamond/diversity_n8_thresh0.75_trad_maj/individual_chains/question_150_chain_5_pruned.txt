Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. Let me try to think through it step by step. I'm a bit new to this, so I might take some wrong turns, but I'll try to figure it out.

The question gives a compound with the molecular formula C8H9NO. The NMR data is provided, and the compound undergoes a series of reactions. I need to find the final product from the options given.

First, let me look at the NMR data. The peaks are at 9.72 ppm (t, 1H), 6.98 (d, 2H), 6.51 (d, 2H), 6.27 (bs, 2H), and 3.66 (d, 2H).

Hmm, the 9.72 ppm peak is a triplet integrating for 1H. That's a high chemical shift, so probably an aldehyde proton. Aldehydes usually show up around 9-10 ppm. So that makes me think that the compound has an aldehyde group.

Then, the 6.98 and 6.51 peaks are both doublets, each integrating for 2H. Those look like aromatic protons, possibly from para-substituted benzene rings. Because in para substitution, the protons are usually as two doublets. So maybe there are two benzene rings connected somehow.

The 6.27 peak is a broad singlet, 2H. That might be some sort of enol or a conjugated system, maybe an alpha, beta-unsaturated aldehyde. Or perhaps it's a diene or some other conjugated system. Alternatively, it could be an aromatic ring with substituents, but the broadness suggests maybe some exchange, like OH protons. Wait, but in the options, some have hydroxy groups. Wait, but the initial compound's formula is C8H9NO. That has one N. So maybe a nitro group? Or an amine?

Wait, the molecular formula is C8H9NO. Let's calculate the degree of unsaturation. Degree of unsaturation is (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. So C=8, H=9, N=1, O=1. So (2*8 + 2 -9 -0 +1)/2 = (18-9+1)/2 = 10/2 = 5. So 5 degrees of unsaturation. That could be two rings and a double bond, or one ring and three double bonds, but more likely two rings and a double bond, or one ring and two double bonds.

Looking at the NMR, the aldehyde suggests a double bond adjacent to the carbonyl. So maybe an alpha,beta-unsaturated aldehyde. That would account for some of the double bonds.

Now, the 3.66 ppm peak is a doublet, 2H. That's probably a CH2 group adjacent to something electronegative, like an oxygen. Maybe an OCH2 group or something like that.

Wait, so putting it together: aldehyde group, two benzene rings (since the two doublets in aromatic regions), an OCH2 group, maybe connected in some way.

Wait, let's think about the possible structure. Maybe the compound is something like cinnamaldehyde derivative. Or perhaps it's a diaryl compound with an aldehyde and an oxygen-bearing CH2 group.

Wait, another thought: the NMR shows a triplet for the aldehyde. So that proton is coupling with two others. So maybe it's part of a conjugated system. Like an enal (alpha,beta-unsaturated aldehyde). For instance, the aldehyde proton is adjacent to a double bond, which would cause it to couple with two protons, hence the triplet.

So, perhaps the structure is something like RCH₂CH₂CHO, but that doesn't fit the aromatic parts. Alternatively, maybe the aldehyde is part of
