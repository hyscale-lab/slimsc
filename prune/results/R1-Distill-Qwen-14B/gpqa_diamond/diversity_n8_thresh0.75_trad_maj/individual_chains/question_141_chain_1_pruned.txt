Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem to solve. Let me think through it step by step. The question is about the reaction of 1-bromobenzene-2-d with sodium amide (NaNH2) in a condensed ammonia solvent. Wait, what's 1-bromobenzene-2-d? Oh, I think that's another way of saying 2-bromo-1,3-dimethylbenzene. Because the numbering would be such that the bromine is on position 1 and the methyl groups on positions 2 and 4? Or maybe I'm mixing something up. Wait, no, the name would be 2-bromo-1,3-dimethylbenzene if the substituents are on positions 1, 2, and 3. Hmm, maybe I should draw the structure.

Wait, 1-bromobenzene-2-d. Oh, wait, that's probably 2-bromo-1,3-dimethylbenzene. Because the 'd' could stand for 'dimethyl'? I'm a bit confused about the nomenclature here. But regardless, the structure is a benzene ring with a bromine and two methyl groups attached. Let me imagine the structure: bromine is at position 1, methyl groups at positions 2 and 3. So the substituents are on adjacent positions, maybe leading to some steric hindrance.

Now, the reaction is with NaNH2 in condensed ammonia. I remember that NaNH2 is a strong base, often used in dehydrohalogenation reactions, especially in aromatic substitution. Wait, but aromatic dehydrohalogenation... Oh,
