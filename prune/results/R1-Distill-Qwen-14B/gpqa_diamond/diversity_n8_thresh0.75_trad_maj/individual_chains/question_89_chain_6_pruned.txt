Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit rusty, but let's see if I can work through it step by step. The question involves a series of reactions starting with 1,3-dibromoadamantane and going through several steps to form product 3. The goal is to determine the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen in the NMR of product 3.

First, I'll break down each reaction step to figure out what's happening structurally.

The first step is heating 1,3-dibromoadamantane with excess KOH at 240Â°C. I remember that when vicinal dihalides (two halogens on adjacent carbons) are treated with a strong base like KOH, they undergo an elimination reaction, typically E2, forming an alkene. Since KOH is a base, it would deprotonate and help in the formation of the double bond by removing the leaving groups (bromide ions here). So, the product 1 should be 1,3-adamantadiene, which would have a double bond between carbons 1 and 2, and another between 3 and 4? Wait, no. Wait, 1,3-dibromoadamantane has bromines on carbons 1 and 3 of the adamantane structure. So eliminating HBr from adjacent carbons would form a double bond between 1 and 2 or 2 and 3? Oh wait, in adamantane, the structure is a diamondoid, so the positions are arranged in a specific way. Let me think. The structure of adamantane is a four-fused cyclohexane rings. 1,3-dibromoadamantane would have Br on two adjacent bridgehead carbons, perhaps. Wait, no, because in adamantane, the bridgehead positions are carbons 1 and 2, but wait, maybe I'm getting the numbering wrong. Alternatively, perhaps when you have 1,3-dibromoadamantane, the two Br are on opposite bridgeheads. So elimination would form a diene. But wait, more accurately, in the structure, elimination would form a single double bond. Oh wait, wait, 1,3-dibromoadamantane would have the Br on positions 1 and 3, which are not adjacent. So elimination may not be possible. Hmm, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Alternatively, perhaps it's a different structure. Wait, wait, I think I'm confusing the structure of adamantane. Let me recall: Adamantane is
