Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about an organic chemistry reaction. The question is a bit complex, but I'll try to break it down step by step. Let's see what I can figure out.

The problem states that compound X, which has the formula C11H12O, reacted with 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane in a nonpolar solvent at 403 K for a day. Then, they give the 1H NMR and 13C NMR spectra of the resulting product. Our task is to identify what compound X was from the options provided.

Hmm, first, I need to recall the reaction conditions. The solvent is nonpolar, and the temperature is 403 K, which is around 130Â°C. The reagent is 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane, which I think is a common base used in certain reactions. Oh wait, that's actually a known base called DBU (1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane). DBU is often used in epoxide ring-opening reactions, especially in acidic conditions or in certain ring-opening mechanisms.

Wait, but compound X is reacting with DBU. So what kind of reaction could that be? I remember that epoxides can undergo ring-opening under basic conditions. But wait, DBU is a strong, non-nucleophilic base. So perhaps the reaction is an acid-catalyzed ring opening? No, wait, DBU is a base, so maybe it's a base-induced ring-opening. Alternatively, maybe the compound X is an epoxide, and DBU is acting as a base in some way.

Wait, wait. Another possibility: maybe the reaction is a conjugate addition. Like the Michael addition or something similar? Or perhaps it's a ring-opening of an epoxide via a nucleophilic attack. Alternatively, since DBU is a bulky base, maybe it's involved in some elimination reaction.

But the product's NMR data is given. So perhaps the product is an epoxide that has undergone some ring-opening. Alternatively, maybe DBU is used in a different context, like a solvent or a catalyst. Wait, no, DBU is a base, so it's probably a reagent.

Let me think about the structure of compound X. The formula is C11H12O. So, molecular weight is 146 g/mol. Let's see, possible functional groups. Epoxides are common, as they have two oxygen atoms in a three-membered ring. Wait no, epoxide has one oxygen. Let's see, epoxide would be something like an ether with a three-membered ring. So, an epoxide has the formula R-O-R', but in a three-membered ring. So, for example, ethylene oxide is the simplest.

If compound X is an epoxide, then reacting it with DBU could lead to ring-opening. But wait, DBU is a strong base, so it would deprotonate something. In epoxide ring-opening under basic conditions, the base abstracts a proton adjacent to the epoxide oxygen, making the ring open. Then, the nucleophile (maybe from DBU, but DBU is a base, not a nucleophile) would attack. Wait, but DBU doesn't have a good leaving group, so
