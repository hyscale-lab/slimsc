Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about SARS-CoV-2 molecular biology. Hmm, I remember that SARS-CoV-2 is the virus causing COVID-19. I need to find the incorrect statement among the options A to D.

Let me go through each option one by one.

Option A: It says that nsp10/nsp14-ExoN operates as heterodimers in a mismatch repair. Oh wait, I think nsp14 has an ExoN domain. Wait, but I remember that these proteins are involved in RNA replication. Oh right, nsp10 pairs with nsp14, and they form a heterodimer which acts as an exoribonuclease. But wait, in the replication process, the exoN is involved in the proofreading function. So the statement that it prevents breakdown of dsRNA might be incorrect. Because in reality, the exoN would remove nucleotides, like in proofreading, not prevent breakdown. Or maybe I'm getting this mixed up. So I need to think more.

Option B: ORF3a triggers caspase-8 activation. Caspase-8 is part of the extrinsic apoptosis pathway. It's activated by death receptors like FAS or TNF receptors. Bcl-2 is more about the intrinsic pathway, as it controls mitochondrial permeability. If ORF3a activates caspase-8 without affecting Bcl-2, then the apoptosis is via extrinsic. I think that's correct because I've read that SARS-CoV-2 ORF3a can activate caspase-8, which is extrinsic. So this statement
