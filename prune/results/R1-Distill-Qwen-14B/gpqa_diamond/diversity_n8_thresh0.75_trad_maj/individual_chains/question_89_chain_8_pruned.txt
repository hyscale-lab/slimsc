Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because it's a bit complex, but I'll try to think it through step by step.

The question starts with 1,3-dibromoadamantane being heated with KOH. Hmm, I remember that when vicinal dihalides (two halogens on adjacent carbons) react with a strong base like KOH, they undergo an elimination reaction, probably an E2 mechanism, forming an alkene. So heating with KOH would likely dehydrohalogenate to form an alkene. The product is a light yellow solid, product 1.

Looking at the NMR data for product 1: The 1H NMR shows a triplet at 4.79 ppm (2H), a multiplet (probably a decoupled region) between 2.41 and 2.23 ppm (10H), and a 1.94 ppm (2H). The IR has a peak at 1720 cm-1, which is typical of a carbonyl group. Wait, if product 1 is from elimination, it should be an alkene. But the IR has a carbonyl peak, so maybe I'm getting this wrong.

Wait, 1,3-dibromoadamantane has two bromines on adjacent carbons in the adamantane structure. When KOH is used, perhaps it's not elimination but a substitution. Oh wait, but KOH is a strong base and not a good nucleophile in this case because of the structure? Or maybe it's an example of a double elimination. Alternatively, perhaps it's an
