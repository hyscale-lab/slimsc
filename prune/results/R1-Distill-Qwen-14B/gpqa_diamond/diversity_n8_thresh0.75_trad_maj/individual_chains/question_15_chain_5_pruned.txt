Okay, so I've got this question about planets and transit detection. Let me try to break it down. Alright, the setup is that researchers are trying to detect transits of two Earth-like planets, Planet_1 and Planet_2. They have limited time, so they want to observe the one more likely to transit. Both are detected via the RV method, so we know their minimum masses and orbital periods. Oh, same masses, but Planet_1 has an orbital period three times shorter than Planet_2.

Wait, wait. So Planet_1's period is shorter, meaning it's closer to its star because the orbital period is inversely related to the distance for the same mass. Right, from Kepler's third law. So Planet_1 is orbiting faster and closer in.

But the stars are different. The host of Planet_1 has twice the mass of Planet_2's host. But both stars have the same radii. Interesting. So even though Planet_1's star is more massive, it's not bigger in radius. So probably a younger star or main-sequence, while Planet_2's host is slightly evolved but same size.

Now, the question is about the probability of a transit. I remember that the probability depends on the size of the planet relative to the star and the orbital distance. The transit probability is roughly (R_planet / R_star)Â² multiplied by something related to the orbital inclination. Wait, no, more accurately, the geometric probability that a planet transits is (R_star + R_planet) / a, where a is the orbital separation. But wait, no, because the planet's size is much smaller than the star, R
