Okay, so I've got this physics problem about the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) and figuring out the energy of the nucleus. Hmm, let me think. The question says that the speed of nucleus X is 0.96c, and we need to find the energy. X is defined as Li with 3 neutrons. Oh wait, Li is lithium. So Li has an atomic number of 3, right? So if it has 3 neutrons, that makes the isotope Li-6, because 3 protons and 3 neutrons equals 6 nucleons. So the mass number A is 6. Got it.

Now, the nucleus is moving at 0.96 times the speed of light. I remember that in relativity, the energy of a particle isn't just kinetic; it's the total energy which includes rest mass energy and kinetic. But wait, the question is about the energy of the collider, so I think it's the total energy of the nucleus. Or maybe the kinetic energy? Hmm, but I've heard that in colliders, the energy usually refers to the kinetic energy. Wait, but I'm not entirely sure. Let me think again.

Wait, the formula for relativistic energy is E = gamma * m0 * c². Gamma is the Lorentz factor, which is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²). So if v is 0.96c, then I can compute gamma. Then multiply that by the rest mass energy of the nucleus.

So first, calculate gamma. Let's plug in v = 0.96c. So beta (β) is 0.96. Gamma is 1 / sqrt(1 - β²). Let's compute that. 1 minus (0.96)^2 is 1 - 0.9216 = 0.0784. Square root of 0.0784 is 0.28. So gamma is 1/0.28 ≈ 3.5714. Wait, wait, let me compute that more accurately. 0.96 squared is 0.9216. 1 - 0.9216 = 0.0784. The square root of 0.0784 is 0.28. So gamma is 1/0.28. Hmm, 1 divided by 0.28 is approximately 3.5714286.

Now, the rest mass of the nucleus. The nucleus is a Li-6 isotope. The mass of a Li-6 nucleus is approximately... wait, I don't remember the exact value, but I can calculate it. The atomic mass of Li-6 is about 6.0141 g/mol (but wait, actually, atomic mass units are in u, where 1u is about 1.66e-27 kg). Alternatively, I can find the mass of the nucleus in kg.

Wait, the molar mass of Li-6 is 6.0141 g/mol, which is 6.0141 * 1e-3 kg/mol. The Avogadro number is 6.022e23 atoms/mol. So per nucleus, the mass is (6.0141e-3 kg/mol) / (6.022e23 atoms/mol) ) ≈ (6.0141e-3) / (6.022e23) kg/nucleus. Let me compute that:

6.0141e-3 /6.022e23 = (6.0141 /6.022) * 1e-26 ≈ approximately 0.99868 * 1e-26 = 9.9868e-27 kg/nucleus.

But wait, another approach: the mass of a single Li-6 nucleus. Each Li-6 has 3 protons and 3 neutrons. The mass of a proton is about 1.6726e-27 kg, neutron is about 1.6749e-27 kg. So total mass is (3 * 1.6726 + 3 * 1.6749) * 1e-27 kg.

Compute that: 3*(1.6726 + 1.6749) = 3*(3.3475) = 10.0425e-27 kg. So m0 ≈ 10.0425e-27 kg.

Wait, but that's more precise than using the molar mass, maybe better. So m0 = 3*(proton + neutron) = 3*(1.6726e-27 +1.6749e-27) = 3*(3.3475e-27) = 10.0425e-27 kg.

So m0 c² is the rest energy. c is 3e8 m/s.

So m0 c² = 10.0425e-27 kg * (3e8 m/s)^2. Let's compute that.

(3e8)^2 = 9e16. So 10.0425e-27 *9e16 = (10.0425 *9) * 1e-11. 10 *9 is 90, 0.0425*9 is 0.3825. So total 90.3825e-11 J. Which is 9.03825e-10 J.

But wait, converting that to GeV. 1 eV is 1.602e-19 J. So 1
