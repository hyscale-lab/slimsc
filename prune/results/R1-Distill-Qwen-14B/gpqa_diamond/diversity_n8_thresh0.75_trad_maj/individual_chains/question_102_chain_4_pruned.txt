Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this science question about a ligand-receptor pair and their expression in a mouse model. Hmm, let me read the question carefully.

So, the setup is that a new ligand-receptor pair was found in neural crest cells, and they want to study their developmental fate. The receptor is a monomeric transmembrane protein with 8 alpha helices, 4 extracellular, and 3 beta sheets for binding. The ligand is a coiled-coil with two alpha helices.

They made a bicistronic lox-Cre vector. Bicistronic means it has two ORFs, right? So, the ligand's ORF is at the 5' end, fused to mCherry, and the receptor is at the 3' end with eGFP at the C-terminus. The ligand is under the CBA promoter, and the receptor has an IRES upstream. 

Wait, so the vector is set up with the ligand first, then the receptor. Each has their own promoter? No, wait. Because the ligand is under CBA, and the receptor is after an IRES. Oh wait, IRES elements allow internal ribosome entry, so maybe the receptor is under a different promoter or controlled by the same? Hmm, I'm a bit fuzzy on bicistronic vectors. Let me think.

Between ligand and mCherry, there's a stop in a loxP-stop-loxP cassette. And between receptor and eGFP, a stop in lox2272-stop-lox2272. Oh, so they've got these stop cassettes. Cre would excise them. LoxP and lox2272 are different lox sites, right? So, when Cre is expressed, it would recombine and remove the stop cassettes, allowing the genes to be expressed.

Wait, so the ligand is under CBA promoter. The vector has ligand first, then a stop cassette, then maybe a second ORF? Or is the receptor under a different promoter? Oh, the way it's described, the ligand is at 5', followed by stop, then the receptor ORF, which is after the IRES. Hmm, perhaps the IRES is allowing for the receptor to be expressed as a separate transcript, but I'm not sure.

They made a mouse model homozygous for this construct in a
