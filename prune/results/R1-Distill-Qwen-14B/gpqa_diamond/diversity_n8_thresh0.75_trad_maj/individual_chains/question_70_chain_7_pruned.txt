Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me start by reading the question carefully.

The problem describes several reactions and asks about the molecular symmetry group of product E. The options are A) C2, B) D4h, C) Dâˆžh, D) C2v. I'm a bit rusty on my symmetry groups, so I'll need to think about that.

First, let's break down the reactions.

1. Solid A reacts with 8 equivalents of gas B to form product C, which is bright red. Hmm, 8 equivalents might suggest a specific stoichiometry. Maybe a common reaction where a solid reacts with a gas in an 8:1 ratio. Oh! Wait, I remember something about sulfur reacting with something. Or maybe it's more like a metal reacting with a diatomic gas. Wait, 8 equivalents... Maybe A is a metal, and B is a diatomic halogen? For example, when a metal reacts with Cl2, often in 1:1 or 2:1 ratios, but wait, 8 equivalents would be 8 moles. Hmm, maybe A is a transition metal, but I'm not sure yet.

2. Product C reacts with 2 equivalents of gas D to produce E, which is extremely hazardous. Extremely hazardous makes me think of something like phosgene or maybe something else, but more likely, a highly toxic gas. Wait, another angle: C reacting with D gives E. Let's see, if C is a compound, maybe it's a chloride, and D is another gas. Alternatively, perhaps C is a metal oxide or something else.

3. C reacts with water to reform A plus two different acids F and G. F is a strong acid, G is a weak acid. So when C is treated with water, it produces two acids. What compounds produce two different acids upon hydrolysis? Maybe a salt of a strong acid and a weak acid. Oh wait, when a sulfide reacts with water, it can produce H2S, but that's a gas. Alternatively, perhaps C is a nitride, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe C is a metal oxide. Hmm, if C is a metal oxide, it reacting with water would form a metal hydroxide, but that's not two acids. Wait, another thought: if C is a salt of a strong acid and a weak acid. Wait, like a salt that isn't just a simple oxide. Alternatively, maybe C is a sulfate or another polyatomic ion.

Wait, let's think about the first reaction again. Solid A with 8
