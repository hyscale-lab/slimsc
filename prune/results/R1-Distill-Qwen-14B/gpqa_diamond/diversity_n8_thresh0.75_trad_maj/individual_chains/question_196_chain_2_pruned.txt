Okay, so I'm trying to solve this physics problem about a relativistic harmonic oscillator. Hmm, I remember that a harmonic oscillator is a system where a mass experiences a restoring force proportional to its displacement, like F = -kx. But wait, this is a relativistic version, so I guess I need to consider special relativity effects, like how mass increases with velocity or something like that.

The question is asking for the maximum speed v_max of the mass. The options given are A, B, C, D. Let me think about how to approach this.

In the classical case (non-relativistic), the maximum speed of a harmonic oscillator occurs when all the potential energy is converted into kinetic energy. So for a classical oscillator, the potential energy is (1/2)kA², where A is the amplitude. The kinetic energy at maximum speed would be (1/2)mv_max². Setting them equal gives (1/2)kA² = (1/2)mv_max² → v_max = sqrt(kA²/m) = sqrt(kA²/m) → which is option C. But wait, this is the classical non-relativistic case. Since the question is relativistic, option C is probably not the correct answer.

In relativistic mechanics, energy considerations are different. The total energy includes rest mass energy and kinetic energy. The energy of the oscillator should be conserved, but in relativity, the total energy E is gamma times mc², where gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²). Also, the potential energy in the relativistic case might not be the same as in the classical case.

Wait, but the problem states that it's obeying Hooke's law, F = -kx. So maybe the potential energy is still (1/2)kx², but the dynamics are governed by relativistic equations.

Hmm, so the total energy of the oscillator should be the sum of the rest mass energy and the kinetic energy. But wait, in the harmonic oscillator, the total mechanical energy (kinetic plus potential) is constant. So in the non-relativistic case, it's (3/2)kA² for a quantum oscillator, but wait no, in the classical case, yes, it's (1/2)kA². Wait, wait: the potential energy at maximum displacement is (1/2)kA², and the kinetic energy is zero there. At the equilibrium position, the kinetic energy is maximum, and the potential is zero. So in the classical case, the total energy is (1/2)kA², and the maximum speed is when all that is converted to kinetic.

But in
