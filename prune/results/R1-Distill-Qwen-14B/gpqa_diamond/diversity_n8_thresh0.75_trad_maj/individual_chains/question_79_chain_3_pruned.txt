Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. The question is about identifying a compound X based on the NMR data of its product after a reaction.

So, the setup is that Compound X (with the formula C11H12O) was reacted with 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane in a nonpolar solvent at 403 K for a day. Then, they looked at the 1H and 13C NMR spectra of the resulting product. We need to figure out what Compound X was from the options given.

First, I remember that 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane is a base used in the ring-opening of epoxides, specifically in epoxide ring-opening reactions. So if Compound X has an epoxide group, reacting it with this base might cause some kind of ring-opening.

Wait, but wait—no, actually, wait. The reaction here is between the epoxide and a base. Oh, but the product's NMR is given. So perhaps the reaction is an acid-catalyzed ring-opening, but in this case, since the solvent is nonpolar and the temperature is 403 K (which is about 130°C), maybe it's a different reaction. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is an epoxidation? No, the starting material is Compound X, which is being reacted. Hmm.

Wait, no, wait. 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane is a strong, non-nucleophilic base. It's used in the Birch reduction and in some eliminations, but wait—it's also used in the ring-opening of epoxides. Oh, but wait, if you have an epoxide and treat it with a base like that, it could cause the ring to open. But how does that affect the NMR?

Wait, the product's NMR is given. So perhaps the reaction transforms the epoxide into something else. But since the product's NMR is provided, maybe the product is the result after the reaction. So the starting material is an epoxide (since the product's data would make sense if the epoxide has been opened or perhaps another change happened).

Wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me think. So, the product after reaction has a particular NMR. Let's look at the NMR data.

Starting with the 1H NMR:

δ 2.28 (3H, s), 2.31 (3H, s), 6.75 (1H, d), 7.08 (2H, d), 7.68 (1H, d), 7.71 (2H, d).

So, the peaks at around 2.28 and 2.31 are two singlets each integrating to 3H. That suggests two methyl groups attached to something deshielded, maybe like adjacent to an oxygen or in an aromatic ring context.

The aromatic region shows some doublets. Let's see: 6.75 (1H, d), 7.08 (2H, d), 7.68 (1H, d), 7.71 (2H, d). So maybe a para-sub
