Okay, so I've got this question about stars and their photospheres. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to work through it step by step. The question says that iron atoms in star_1's photosphere are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to star_2. Oh right, and the energy difference between the levels is given as 1.38e-23 J. The question is about finding the correct equation relating their effective temperatures T1 and T2, assuming Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE).

Wait, LTE means that the gas in the photosphere is in thermal equilibrium with the radiation field, so we can use the Boltzmann distribution here. Right, Boltzmann distribution relates the population of different energy levels in a system. The formula is something like the ratio of the number of particles in two energy states.

The Boltzmann factor is (g_i/g_j) * exp( -(E_i - E_j)/(k T) ), where g is the statistical weight, E the energy, k the Boltzmann constant, and T the temperature.

In this problem, the energy difference is given. Let me denote the two energy levels as E1 and E2, with E1 being higher than E2 by ΔE = 1.38e-23 J. Wait, no, wait. No, the problem says that the energy difference is 1.38e-23 J. So ΔE = E_upper - E_lower = 1.38e-23 J.

The question states that the number of excited atoms in star_1 is twice that of star_2 for the same energy level. Wait, but wait: it says "iron atoms in the photosphere of star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level when compared to star_2." So the number of atoms in the excited state in star_1 is twice that in star_2.

Wait, but in the Boltzmann distribution, the ratio of populations depends on temperature. Let me think about the expression. Let's say for each star, the number of atoms in the upper energy level is N_upper, and the lower is N_lower. Since the question is about the same specific energy level, perhaps comparing the same transition in each star?

Wait, maybe I should consider the ratio of N_upper to N_lower for each star. For star 1, N_1_upper / N_1_lower = (g_upper/g_lower) * exp(-ΔE/(k T1)).

Similarly for star 2: N_2_upper /
