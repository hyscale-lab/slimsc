Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. I'm a bit rusty, but let's break it down step by step. The question is about finding the uncertainty in P_z, given that the system is in an eigenstate of P_x with a specific eigenvalue.

First, I remember that the uncertainty in an operator is calculated using the formula ΔP = sqrt(⟨P²⟩ - ⟨P⟩²). So I need to compute both the expectation value of P_z and the expectation value of P_z squared.

Wait, but the system is in an eigenstate of P_x, not P_z. So I can't directly say anything about ⟨P_z⟩ unless I express the state in terms of the eigenstates of P_z. Because the uncertainty depends on how the state is projected onto the eigenstates of the operator we're looking at.

The basis vectors here are the eigenvectors of P_z. So the state is expressed in the P_z basis. The state vector given is |ψ⟩ = (-1/2, 1/√2, -1/2)^T. Let's denote this as a column vector.

Let me write down the matrix for P_z. From the problem statement, P_z is a diagonal matrix with entries (ħ, 0, -ħ). So P_z = diag(ħ, 0, -ħ).

Now, since the state is already given in the P_z basis, the expectation value ⟨P_z⟩ is just the sum of each component multiplied by the corresponding eigenvalue. Let me compute that.

The state is |ψ⟩ = [a, b, c]^T where a = -1/2, b=1/√2, c=-1/2.

So ⟨P_z⟩ = |a|^2 * (ħ) + |b|^2 * 0 + |c|^2 * (-ħ).

Calculating each term:

|a|^2 = (1/2)^2 = 1/4 → 1/4 * ħ = ħ/4
|b|^2 = (1/√2)^2 = 1/2 → 1/2 * 0 = 0
|c|^2 = (1/2)^2 = 1/4 → 1/4 * (-ħ) = -ħ/4

Adding them up: ħ/4 + 0 - ħ/4 = 0. So ⟨P_z⟩ is zero.

Next, I need to find ⟨P_z²⟩. Since P_z is diagonal, P_z² is just each diagonal element squared. So P_z squared is diag(ħ², 0, ħ²).

So ⟨P_z²⟩ = |a|^2 * (ħ²) + |b|^2 * 0 + |c|^2 * (ħ²).

Which is:

(1/4) * ħ² + (1/2)*0 + (1/4)* ħ² → (1/4 + 1/4) ħ² = (1/2) ħ².

Then, the uncertainty ΔP_z is sqrt(⟨P_z²⟩ - ⟨P_z⟩²) = sqrt( (1/2 ħ²) - 0 ) = sqrt( (ħ²)/2 ) → ħ / sqrt(2).

Wait,
