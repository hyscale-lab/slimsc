Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let me read the question again.

So, the setup is that there are ten thousand identical systems, each with a particle in a tube along the x-axis. The wave function is given as (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i, where i is the square root of -1. When they measure the position of the particles, none were found outside the region between x=1 and x=3. I need to find the value of 'a' from the options given.

Hmm, I remember that in quantum mechanics, the wave function must be normalized. Normalization means the total probability of finding the particle somewhere in space is 1. So the integral of the absolute square of the wave function over all space should equal 1.

Wait, but wait. The wave function is given as Ïˆ(x) = (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i. Oh wait, but that can't be right because the imaginary part would complicate things. Or maybe the wave function is a complex function, but the real part is (a / sqrt(1+x)) and the imaginary part is 0.5. Hmm, wait, no, actually, the way it's written, it's (a/sqrt(1+x)) minus 0.5i. So the wave function is a complex number with real part a/sqrt(1+x) and imaginary part -0.5.

Wait, but usually, the wave function can be complex, but when normalizing, we take the modulus squared
