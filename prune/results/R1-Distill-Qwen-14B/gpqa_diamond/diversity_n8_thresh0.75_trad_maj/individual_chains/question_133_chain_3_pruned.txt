Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm not super confident with equilibrium problems, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The problem says we have a solution with a volume of 200.00 cm³, which I think is 200 mL. The solution contains 1.00 g of KH₂PO₄ and 1.00 g of Na₂HPO₄·2H₂O. We need to find the concentration of orthophosphate ions, PO₄³-.

Hmm. I remember that orthophosphate is the conjugate base, so it's probably involved in some kind of buffer system. Both KH₂PO₄ and Na₂HPO₄ are related to phosphoric acid, H₃PO₄. Let me jot down what I know about the dissociation steps of H₃PO₄.

Phosphoric acid has three dissociation steps:
1. H₃PO₄ ⇌ H⁺ + H₂PO₄⁻ (Ka1 = 7.5e-3)
2. H₂PO₄⁻ ⇌ H⁺ + HPO₄²- (Ka2 = 6.2e-8)
3. HPO₄²- ⇌ H⁺ + PO₄³- (Ka3 = 1.8e-12)

So each step releases a proton and forms the next conjugate base. 

Now, looking at the compounds given: KH₂PO₄ is potassium hydrogen phosphate, which I think is H₂PO₄⁻. Na₂HPO₄·2H₂O is sodium hydrogen phosphate dihydrate, which should be HPO₄²-. So we have H₂PO₄⁻ and HPO₄²- in solution. 

Since these are adjacent in the dissociation steps, they form a buffer. The phosphate buffer system here is H₂PO₄⁻ and HPO₄²-, which are the conjugate acid and base, I think. So the buffer will involve their respective Ka values. Wait, but wait, which Ka applies here? 

H₂PO₄⁻ can donate a proton to become HPO₄²- (that's the second dissociation, so Ka2 is 6.2e-8). So the buffer equation would be H₂PO₄⁻ ⇌ H⁺ + HPO₄²-. So the relevant Ka is Ka2, which is 6.2e-8.

In a buffer solution, the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation is useful. The equation is pH = pKa + log([base]/[acid]). But wait, in this case, the acid is H₂PO₄⁻ and the base is HPO₄²- because H₂PO₄⁻ donates a proton to form HPO₄²-.

So the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation becomes pH = pKa2 + log([HPO₄²-]/[H₂PO₄⁻]).

But wait, the question isn't directly asking for pH; it's asking for the concentration of PO₄³- ions. Oh, right. That's the third dissociation step's product. So I need to find [PO₄³-].

Wait, but in the solution, we have HPO₄²- and H₂PO₄⁻. How does that relate to PO₄³-? Because HPO₄²- can dissociate further into PO₄³- and H+ (from the third Ka, Ka3=1.8e-12). So the concentration of PO₄³- would be determined by the dissociation of HPO₄²-.

Hmm. Let me think. So the solution has HPO₄²- and H₂PO₄⁻. Since the solution is buffered around pH near pKa2, which is about log(6.2e-8) → pKa2 is about 7.21 (since Ka is 6.2e-8 → pKa is about 7.21). 

But wait, the pH of the solution is determined by the buffer, so perhaps I can first find the pH and then see how much HPO₄²- dissociates into PO₄³-.

Alternatively, maybe I can consider that in solution, HPO4²- can dissociate into PO4³- and H+. The concentration of PO4³- would be very low because Ka3 is really small (1.8e-12). So perhaps I can calculate [H+] from the buffer, then use that to find [PO4³-].

Let me plan this:

Step 1: Calculate the moles of KH₂PO₄ and Na₂HPO₄·2H₂O.

Step 2: Determine the concentrations of H₂PO₄⁻ and HPO₄²- in the solution.

Step 3: Use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation to find pH.

Step 4: Using [H+] from Step 3, find the concentration of PO₄³- through the dissociation of HPO₄²-.

Alternatively, perhaps a better approach is to calculate the pH using the buffer, then use that pH to find the concentration of PO4^3- from the third dissociation.

Let me proceed step by step.

Step 1: Moles of each compound.

Molar masses given:

KH₂PO₄: Mw = 136.09 g/mol.

Na₂HPO₄·2H₂O: Mw = 177.99 g/mol.

Moles of KH₂PO₄ = mass / Mw = 1.00 g / 136.09 g/mol ≈ 0.007339 mol.

Moles of Na₂HPO₄·2H₂O = 1
