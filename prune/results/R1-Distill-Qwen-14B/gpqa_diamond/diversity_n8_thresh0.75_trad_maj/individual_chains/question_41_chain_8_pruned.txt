Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about light passing through a moving glass medium. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but let's try to think through this. The question is asking about the speed of light in the glass relative to an observer in the lab. The glass is moving at a constant velocity v in the same direction as the light beam, and towards the observer. Wait, no, wait. Oh no, the problem says the glass is moving toward the observer. Or wait, no, it says the same direction as the beam and toward the observer. Wait, the beam is moving toward the observer, and the glass is moving in the same direction, which would be toward the observer as well. So the glass is moving towards the observer, same as the light.

So the setup is: a glass slab with index of refraction n is moving with velocity v. The light is moving in the same direction as the glass. The lab frame is where the glass is moving at velocity v. We need to find the speed of light in the glass as observed in the lab frame.

Wait, but I remember that in special relativity, velocities don't just add up linearly. Oh wait, but wait, this is about light in a medium. So Newtonian mechanics wouldn't apply here because the speed of light in a medium is c/n, but when the medium is moving, things get tricky.

Wait, but the question is about the speed of light in the glass relative to the lab. So in the glass's rest frame, the speed of light is c/n. But since the glass is moving, we have to transform it to the lab frame.

Wait, is this a case where we can use the relativistic velocity addition formula? Because in
