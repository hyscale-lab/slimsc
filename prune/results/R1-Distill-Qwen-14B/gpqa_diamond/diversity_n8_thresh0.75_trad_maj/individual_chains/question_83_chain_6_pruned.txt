Okay, so I need to figure out the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point when I titrate a diluted acetic acid solution with NaOH. Let me think through this step by step.

First, the problem says we start with 20.00 cm³ (which is 0.020 L) of 0.05 M acetic acid. Then we dilute it with 20.00 cm³ of water. So the total volume becomes 40 cm³ or 0.040 L. I should calculate the new concentration after dilution.

Concentration after dilution is (volume1 × concentration1) / total volume. So that's (20 mL × 0.05 M) / 40 mL. Wait, 20 mL is 0.020 L, but since units are mL, I can just compute it in mL to avoid unit confusion. 20 mL × 0.05 M = 1 mmol. Then divided by 40 mL gives 0.025 M. So the diluted acetic acid is 0.025 M.

Now, when we titrate this with 0.1 M NaOH. The equivalence point occurs when moles of NaOH equal moles of acetic acid. The initial moles of acetic acid (CH3COOH) are 0.02 L × 0.05 M = 0.001 moles. Wait, no, wait: 20 mL × 0.05 M = 1 mmol. Because 20 mL is 0.02 L, 0.02 * 0.05 = 0.001 mol, which is 1 mmol.

When we dilute with 20 mL, the volume is 40 mL, so concentration is 1 mmol / 40 mL = 0.025 M. So the moles of acetic acid are 1 mmol.

At equivalence, moles of NaOH needed is 1 mmol, because 1:1 reaction. Since NaOH is 0.1 M, the volume needed is moles / Molarity = 1 mmol / 0.1 mol/L = 0.01 L = 10 mL. So the equivalence point is when 10 mL of NaOH is added.

But wait, wait. The problem is about the pH at 25% titration and
