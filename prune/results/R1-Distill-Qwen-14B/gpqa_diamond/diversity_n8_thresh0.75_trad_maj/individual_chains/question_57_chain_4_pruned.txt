Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about elastic scattering of electrons. Hmm, it's a bit tricky, but I'll try to think it through. Let me read the question again.

The question gives me phase shifts δ₀=90°, δ₁=67°, δ₂=55°, δ₃=30°, and δ₄=13°. Oh wait, and I'm supposed to ignore phase shifts beyond δ₄. I'm asked to calculate the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude along the incident beam direction. The options are A to D with some numbers in fm, which I think stands for fermi, a unit of length.

Wait, I remember that in scattering theory, the scattering amplitude f can be expressed in terms of the phase shifts. The formula, if I recall correctly, is something like f(θ) = (1/(2ik)) * Σ (exp(imθ) - 1) * something. Oh wait, more accurately, the scattering amplitude f(θ) for each partial wave is given by (1/(2ik)) multiplied by the sum over l of (exp(iδ_l) - 1) multiplied by some spherical harmonics terms, but maybe that's more detailed than needed.

Wait, wait, but the question specifies the imaginary part along the incident beam direction. Oh right, along the beam direction, the scattering angle θ is zero. So maybe that simplifies things because at θ=0, the terms might have some specific properties.

Wait, another approach: the scattering amplitude f has real and imaginary parts. The imaginary part is related to the total cross-section. Because I remember that the total cross-section σ_total is given by 4π |f|^2 / (k^2), but wait, no, more precisely, the imaginary part of f is related to the optical theorem, which connects the imaginary part to the total cross-section.

Wait, but maybe I can find the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude f directly from the phase shifts. Let me think again. The general expression for f is a sum over all l of ( (exp(2iδ_l) - 1) ) times some terms involving the Legendre polynomials. Oh wait, or is it (exp(iδ_l) - 1) multiplied by something else.

Wait, perhaps the formula is f(θ) = (1/(2ik)) Σ [ (exp(iδ_l) - 1) P_l(cosθ) ], where P_l are the Legendre polynomials. Oh wait, but when θ=0, cosθ=1, so P_l(1) is 1 for all l. So the sum becomes (1/(2ik)) Σ (exp(iδ_l) - 1).

So the scattering amplitude f(θ=0) would be (1/(2ik)) times the sum from l=0 to l=4 of (exp(iδ_l) - 1), since higher l's are ignored.

Wait, but 2ik is a term. Let me think about the value of k. The wave number k is given by sqrt(2mE)/ħ, but maybe here I can just consider the expression in terms of the given phase shifts.

But wait, the problem asks for the imaginary part of f. So let's compute f and take its imaginary part.

So f(0) = (1/(2ik)) * [ (e^{iδ₀} - 1) + (e^{iδ₁} - 1) + ... + (e^{iδ₄} - 1) ].

The sum inside is sum_l (e^{iδ_l} - 1) for l=0 to 4.

Let me compute each term:

For each l, e^{iδ_l} is cosδ_l + i sinδ_l. So e^{iδ} - 1 = (cosδ - 1) + i sinδ.

So each term in the sum is (cosδ_l - 1) + i sinδ_l.

Summing all these for l=0 to 4:

Sum_real = sum (cosδ_l - 1)
Sum_imag = sum sinδ_l

So f(0) = [1/(2ik)] * (Sum_real + i Sum_imag)

Let me compute Sum_real and Sum_imag.

But wait, the imaginary part of f(0) is the coefficient of the i in the expression, multiplied by 1/(2ik). Wait, but let's make it clear.

Wait, f(0) = [1/(2ik)] * (Sum_real + i Sum_imag)
= [Sum_real/(2ik)] + [i Sum_imag/(2ik)]

Simplify each term:

Sum_real/(2ik) = (Sum_real) / (2ik)
i Sum_imag/(2ik) = [i/(2ik)] Sum_imag = [1/(2k)] Sum_imag

So f(0) has two parts: one real and one imaginary.

So the imaginary part of f(0) is [1/(2k)] * Sum_imag.

Because the first term (Sum_real/(2ik)) is real divided by imaginary, which would be imaginary, but the second term is (1/(2k)) Sum_imag, which is real.

Wait, no, perhaps I should compute each term correctly.

Wait, f(0) is [ (Sum_real + i Sum_imag) ] / (2ik)

So f(0) = [ (Sum_real) + i Sum_imag ] / (2ik )

Let me write 2ik as 2i k.

So,

f(0) = [ Sum_real + i Sum_imag ] / (2i k )

We can factor this as:

= [ Sum_real / (2i k) ) ] + [ i Sum_imag / (2i k) ]

Simplify each term:

The first term: Sum_real/(2i k) = -(i) Sum_real/(2 k ) (since 1/i = -i)

The second term: i/(2i k) Sum_imag = Sum_imag/(2k)

So f(0) = [ -i Sum_real/(2k) )
