Okay, so I'm trying to figure out which planet has a higher probability of transiting. Hmm, I remember that the probability of a planet transiting its star depends on a few factors. I think the main ones are the size of the planet relative to the star and the size of the orbit. Oh wait, also, the alignment of the orbit relative to our line of sight matters, but since they both have circular orbits, I guess the alignment is already considered, maybe similar probabilities?

Wait, the question says both planets have already been detected via the RV method. So that tells me their minimum masses are known. But for transit probability, I think the key factors are the orbital period and the star's size, as well as the planet's size.

Wait, transit probability is actually given by the formula P = (R_planet / R_star)^2 * (a / (sqrt(a^2 + h^2))), where h is the height of the planet's orbit in some terms. Wait, maybe I'm mixing up some details. Alternatively, I've heard that the probability is approximately (R_p / R_s)^2 multiplied by (1 / (sqrt(1 + (a/R_s)^2))) ), but I'm not totally sure. Alternatively, another approach is that the probability is roughly (R_p / R_s)^2 multiplied by (1 / (sin i)), where i is the inclination. Wait, but since we can't observe i, which is typically unknown, but for the transit method, i is close to 90 degrees. So maybe the probability is higher when the planet is larger, the star is smaller, and the planet is closer to the star.
