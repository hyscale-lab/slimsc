Okay, so I'm trying to figure out which of the given organic compounds exhibit optical isomerism. Hmm, optical isomerism, right? That's when a compound has chiral centers, meaning it's not superimposable on its mirror image. So the compound should have a carbon with four different substituents attached.

The question lists four moieties, and I need to check each one for chirality.

Let's go one by one.

1. Dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate. Wait, that's a mouthful. So it's a biphenyl structure with substituents. Let me visualize this. The main structure is two benzene rings connected by a single bond. The substituents are at positions 2 and 2' on each ring, and 6 and 6' on each ring. Each of these positions has either a nitro group or a methyl ester of a carboxylic acid. Wait, the substituents are at 2 and 2', which are across from the connecting bond. So each ring has a nitro group at 6 and 6', and a carboxylate group at 2 and 2'. Wait no, correction: the actual substituents are nitro and the dicarboxylate parts. Wait, the formula is dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro... so each benzene has a nitro at 6 and 6', and each has a carboxylate group at 2. So each benzene ring has two substituents: a nitro and a carbonyl (as in the ester group). Oh wait, the substituents are 6,6' dinitro and 2,2' di-carboxylate. So each ring has a nitro group at position 6 and a carboxylate ester at position 2. So the structure is two benzene rings connected, each with substituents at 6 and 2. Now, considering the possibility of a plane of symmetry. If the substituents are arranged in a way that creates a plane of symmetry, then
