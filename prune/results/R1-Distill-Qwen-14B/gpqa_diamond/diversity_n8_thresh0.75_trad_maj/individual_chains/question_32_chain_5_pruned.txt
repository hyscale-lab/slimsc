Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider, RHIC. The question is asking for the energy of the collider when the speed of the nucleus is 0.96c. The nucleus in question is X, which is defined as Li with 3 neutrons. Hmm, Li is lithium, right? So the isotope would be Li-6 because Li usually has 3 protons and adding 3 neutrons makes it 6 nucleons total.

Wait, so the nucleus is Li-6. I remember that the mass number A is the sum of protons and neutrons. So Li has Z=3, so N=3 too. So A=3+3=6. That makes the nucleus a Li-6 ion.

Now, the problem is about relativistic energy. Oh right, in relativity, the energy of a particle isn't just kinetic; it's the total energy which includes rest mass energy and kinetic. But wait, the question says the energy of the RHIC, so I think they mean the total energy each ion is accelerated to.

The speed is given as 0.96c. I need to find the energy, probably the total energy, which is gamma times the rest mass energy.

So first, I should find gamma. Gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²). Let's compute that. So v is 0.96c, so v²/c² is (0.96)^2 = 0.9216.

1 - 0.9216 is 0.0784. The square root of that is sqrt(0.0784). Let me calculate that. Hmm, sqrt(0.0784) is 0.28 because 0.28 squared is 0.0784. So 1 over 0.28 is approximately 3.5714. Let me double-check that calculation. Yes, 0.28 times 3.5714 is about 1. So gamma is approximately 3.5714.

Next, the rest mass energy of the Li-6 nucleus. The mass of a nucleus can be found using the mass of the individual protons and neutrons. Each proton is about 938 MeV/c², same for neutrons. So for Li-6: 3 protons and 3 neutrons. So 6 nucleons in total.

So the rest mass energy would be 6 * 938 MeV. Let me compute that. 6 * 900 is 5400, and 6 *38 is 228, so 5400+228=5628 MeV. Wait, but wait, I think that's an approximation. Because if I take the exact proton mass as 938.272 MeV, and neutron is about 939.565 MeV. So let me get more accurate numbers.

Proton mass (m_p) ≈ 938.272 MeV/c²
Neutron mass (m_n) ≈ 939.565 MeV/c²

So for Li-6: 3*(m_p + m_n) ?

Wait, no, wait. Each Li-6 nucleus has 3 protons and 3 neutrons. So the total rest
