Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on relativity, but let's try to tackle this step by step.

The question says: Two astronauts with masses 2m and 3m are moving at 0.6c and 0.5c in the positive x-direction. We need to find their relative speed and the total energy of the system. The options are A to D.

Wait, first, relative speed. I remember that in relativity, you can't just add speeds like you do in classical mechanics. Oh right, you use the velocity addition formula. The formula is (u + v)/(1 + (u*v)/c²). But wait, does that apply here? Let me think.

Wait, but wait. The astronauts are moving in the same direction. So their relative speed is the difference between their speeds, right? No, wait, no, in relativity, it's not that simple. Because when you're in a frame moving at some velocity, you have to account for the effects of relativity.

Wait, so astronaut A is moving at 0.6c, and astronaut B is moving at 0.5c. But wait, both are in the same direction. So if we're looking for the relative speed of A as seen from B's frame, or vice versa. Oh right, because the question says "relative speed" without specifying direction. Do we need to compute each's speed relative to the other?

Wait, but since they are moving in the same direction, the relative speed would be the difference, but adjusted for relativity. So perhaps I should use the velocity addition formula.

So let me denote the frames. Let’s say S is the rest frame, and S' is moving at some speed. Wait, maybe it's better to compute the relative speed from each astronaut's perspective. For example, what is the speed of astronaut 2m as seen from the 3m astronaut's frame, or vice versa.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is simply asking for the speed of one astronaut relative to the other, considering relativity. So let's assume that. Let's say we want to find the speed of the 2m astronaut as seen from the 3m astronaut's frame.

Wait, but wait, the 3m astronaut is moving at 0.5c in the S frame. And the 2m is moving at 0.6c. So in the S frame, the speed of astronaut A (2m) is u = 0.6c, and astronaut B (3m) is v = 0.5c. So to find the speed of A as seen from B’s frame, we use the velocity addition formula. Because in B's frame, B is stationary, and A is moving at (u - v') where v' is adjusted by relativity.

Wait, the formula is u' = (u - v)/(1 - (u*v)/(c²)). So substituting u as 0.6c and v as 0.5c:

u' = (0.6c - 0.5c) / (1 - (0.6c * 0.5c)/c²).

Simplify numerator: 0.1c.

Denominator: 1 - (0.3 c²)/c² = 1 - 0.3 = 0.7.

So u' = (0.1c)/(0.7) ≈ 0.142857c ≈ 0.143c. So approximately 0.14c, which is about option C or D.

Wait, option C has v_rel =0.14c. Option D same relative speed.

So the relative speed is around 0.14c. So that's one part.

Now, the total energy of the system. Each astronaut has relativistic energy, so we need to compute the total energy.

Wait, each's energy is gamma * m c². But wait, in their rest frame, their mass is m, but their relativistic mass is gamma times m.

Wait, no. Wait, energy is gamma m c squared. So for each astronaut, we calculate their energy and sum them.

So astronaut 2m's energy: E1 = gamma1 * 2m c².

Astronaut 3m's energy: E2 = gamma2 *3m c².

Gamma for each is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²).

So for astronaut 2m: v = 0.6c. Gamma = 1/sqrt(1 - 0.36) = 1/sqrt(0.64) = 1/0.8 = 1.25.

So E1 = 1.25 * 2m c² = 2.5 m c².

Astronaut 3m: v =0.5c. Gamma =1/sqrt(1 -0.25)=1/sqrt(0.75)= approx 1.1547.

So E2 =1.1547 *3m c² ≈ 3.464 m c².

Total energy E = E1 + E2 = 2.5 + 3.464 = 5.964 m c². So approximately 5.96 mc².

Looking at options, option C says E=5.96 mc², and relative speed 0.14c. Option D has E=5mc², which is lower.

So the correct answer would have v_rel=0.14c and E=5.96 mc², which is option C.


To solve the problem, we need to determine the relative speed of the two astronauts and the total energy of the system.

### Relative Speed
The relative speed of one astronaut as seen from the other's frame is calculated using the relativistic velocity addition formula:

\[
v_{\text{rel}} = \frac{u - v}{1 - \frac{uv}{c^2}}
\]

Here, astronaut A (mass \(2m\)) moves at \(u = 0.6c\), and astronaut B (mass \(3m\)) moves at \(v = 0.5c\). Substituting these values:

\[
v_{\text{rel}} = \frac{0.6c - 0.5c}{1 - \frac{(0.6c)(0.5c)}{c^2}}
\]

Simplify the numerator:

\[
v_{\text{rel}} = \frac{0.1c}{1 - 0.3} = \frac{0.1c}{0.7} \approx 0.142857c \approx 0.14c
\]

Thus, the relative speed is approximately \(0.14c\).

### Total Energy of the System
The total energy of the system is the sum of the relativistic energies of the two astronauts. The relativistic energy of an object is given by:

\[
E = \gamma mc^2, \quad \text{where } \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}}}
\]

For astronaut A (\(2m\), \(v = 0.6c\)):

\[
\gamma_A = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - 0.36}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.64}} = 1.25
\]
\[
E_A = \gamma_A \cdot 2m \cdot c^2 = 1.25 \cdot 2m \cdot c^2 = 2.5mc^2
\]

For astronaut B (\(3m\), \(v = 0.5c\)):

\[
\gamma_B = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - 0.25}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.75}} \approx 1.1547
\]
\[
E_B = \gamma_B \cdot 3m \cdot c^2 = 1.1547 \cdot 3m \cdot c^2 \approx 3.464mc^2
\]

The total energy of the system is:

\[
E_{\text{total}} = E_A + E_B = 2.5mc^2 + 3.464mc^2 \approx 5.96mc^2
\]

### Final Answer
The relative speed is \(0.14c\), and the total energy of the system is \(5.96mc^2\). Comparing with the options, the correct choice is:
