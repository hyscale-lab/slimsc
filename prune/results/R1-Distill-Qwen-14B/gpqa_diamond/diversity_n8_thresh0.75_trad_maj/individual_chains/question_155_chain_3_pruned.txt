Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this stuff, but I'll try to think it through step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

Alright, the problem involves the uncertainty in the P_z operator. I remember that the uncertainty in an observable is calculated using the standard deviation formula. So, for P_z, the uncertainty ΔP_z is the square root of the expectation of P_z squared minus the square of the expectation of P_z.

Mathematically, that's ΔP_z = sqrt( <P_z²> - <P_z>² ). 

But wait, I need to find these expectation values. The system is in an eigenstate of P_x with eigenvalue -ħ, and the state is given as a column vector: (-1/2, 1/√2, -1/2). So, the state |ψ> is this vector, and I need to compute the expectation values for P_z and P_z squared.

First, I need to write the state vector correctly. The given vector is (-1/2, 1/√2, -1/2), so that's a column vector with three components. Let me note that down:

|ψ> = [ -1/2, 1/√2, -1/2 ]^T.

Now, the operator P_z is given as a matrix:

P_z = [ [ ħ, 0, 0 ],
         [ 0, 0, 0 ],
         [ 0, 0, -ħ ] ]

Wait, no, looking again, the matrix is:

First row: [ħ, 0, 0 ]

Second row: [0, 0, 0 ]

Third row: [0, 0, -ħ ]

Wait, no, wait. The matrix is given as:

The first row is (ħ, 0, 0), second row (0,0,0), third row (0,0,-ħ). So, the matrix looks like:

[[ ħ, 0, 0 ],
 [ 0, 0, 0 ],
 [ 0, 0, -ħ ] ]

So P_z is a diagonal matrix because only the diagonal elements are non-zero. That makes things easier because diagonal matrices are straightforward to apply to vectors.

So, to compute <P_z>, I need to calculate the expectation value of P_z in the state |ψ>.

The expectation value <A> for an
