Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through step by step. Let's see what the question is.

The question says: Racemic 3-methylpent-1-ene is treated with Grubbs catalyst. How many possible products are there (excluding ethene)? The options are A)4, B)8, C)6, D)2.

Hmm. Right, Grubbs catalyst is involved. Oh wait, Grubbs is used for olefin metathesis reactions. Metathesis is when you break and reform carbon-carbon double bonds, right? Grubbs is specifically a transition metal catalyst, I think it's a ruthenium-based catalyst. It's used for ring-closing metathesis and ring-opening metathesis as well as cross metathesis.

The starting material is racemic 3-methylpent-1-ene. Wait, what's that structure? Let me draw it out. Pent-1-ene means the double bond is between C1 and C2. So the structure would be CH₂=CHCH(CH₂CH3)₂? Wait, wait, no. Wait, pent-1-ene is CH₂=CHCH₂CH₂CH3. But wait, 3-methylpent-1-ene would have a methyl group on the third carbon. So let's count: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.

Structure: The main chain is five carbons, with a double bond starting at C1. So the structure is CH₂=CH-CH(CH3)-CH₂-? Wait, wait, no. Wait, pent-1-ene is CH₂=CHCH₂CH₂CH3. But if it's 3-methyl, that means on carbon 3, which is the third carbon, so the structure is CH₂=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3? No, wait, because that would be 3-methylpent-1-ene. So the structure is CH₂=CHCH(CH3)CH₂CH3? Wait, but that's six carbons. Oh wait, no, wait: pent has five carbons. So pent-1-ene is CH₂=CHCH₂CH₂CH3. But 3-methyl would be a branch on the third carbon, which is the middle carbon of the chain.

Wait, maybe it's CH₂=CH-C(CH3)H-CH2-CH3? No, wait, that can't be right. Let's think again. Pent implies five carbons. So 3-methylpent-1-ene would be:

Carbon 1: CH₂=
Carbon 2: CH-
Carbon 3: C(CH3)
Carbon 4: CH₂
Carbon 5: CH3

Wait, no. Let me count correctly. The double bond is between C1 and C2. So the structure is:

CH₂=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3? No, that's six carbons. I must be getting confused. Wait, pentane has five carbons. So pent-1-ene is five carbons with a double bond starting at C1. So structure is CH₂=CHCH₂CH₂CH3. If it's 3-methyl, then on the third carbon (which is CH₂ in the above structure), we add a methyl group? So the third carbon would be CH(CH3). Wait, but wait, the third
