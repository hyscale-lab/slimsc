Okay, so I've got this question about stars and their distribution in the sky, and how the number of stars per unit range of parallax changes with parallax. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through.

First, I remember that parallax is related to distance. Oh right, the parallax (plx) is the reciprocal of distance in parsecs. So plx = 1/distance. That means if a star is farther away, its parallax is smaller. Like, nearby stars have larger parallaxes, and as you go further, they get smaller.

The question says stars are uniformly distributed. Wait, uniform distribution in what sense? Oh, I think it means that the number of stars per unit volume in space is the same everywhere. So the number density is constant.

So, the number of stars in a certain volume depends on the volume. But how does that translate to parallax?

Let me think about the volume as a function of distance. So if I imagine a sphere with radius r (distance), the volume is (4/3)πr³. But wait, in this case, we're talking about parallax, so plx = 1/r. So r = 1/plx. Substituting that into the volume, the volume becomes (4/3)π (1/plx)^3 = 4π/(3 plx^3).

But wait, how does this relate to the number of stars? If the number density is n (stars per unit volume), then the number of stars in a volume around distance r is n multiplied by the volume between r and r + dr. So the number of stars in a thin shell of radius r and thickness dr would be n * 4π r² dr. Because the volume element for a shell is surface area (4πr²) times dr.

But wait, maybe I'm getting confused between volume and the distribution in parallax. Let me rephrase: since parallax is inversely proportional to distance, I can express everything in terms of plx.

So, if I have a range of parallax from plx to plx + dplx, what's the corresponding range in distance? Well, plx = 1/d, so d = 1/plx. So when plx changes by dplx, d changes by (d plx)/plx². Because d = 1/plx, so dd = - (d plx) / plx². But I'm more interested in the range of distance intervals, but perhaps I should approach this from the density in plx space.

Alternatively, another approach: the number of stars per unit volume in space is constant, say n. So, the number of stars in a volume element dV is n dV.

But I want to find how the number of stars per unit range of plx (dplx) varies with plx. So, considering a thin slice in parallax space.

Wait, maybe it's better to express the number of stars in a certain plx range and then find the number per unit plx.

Let me think: the number of stars in a shell at distance d is n * 4π d² dd. Because the volume of a thin shell is 4πd² dd, and n is stars per volume. So the number of stars in that shell is n * 4π d² dd.

But since plx = 1/d, then d = 1/plx. Also, dd = - (d plx) / (plx)^2. Because d = 1/plx, so dd = - (1/(plx)^2) d plx.

Wait, maybe I should express dd in terms of dplx. Let's see: plx = 1/d => d = 1/plx. So, differentiating both sides, dd = - (d plx) / (plx)^2. But since we're dealing with small increments, the negative just indicates direction, but for the number of stars, we can take the magnitude.

So, substituting d and dd into the number of stars equation:

Number of stars = n * 4π ( (1/plx)^2 ) * ( d plx / plx^2 )

Wait, wait, let me double-check. Because d = 1/plx, so d² is 1/plx². And dd is (d plx) / plx², but with a negative sign, but since we're considering a small change, we can ignore the negative.

So number of stars = n * 4π (1/plx²) * (d plx / plx² ) = n * 4π (1/plx^4) d plx.

So the number of stars per unit plx (dplx) is n * 4π / plx^4.

Wait, that would mean the number is proportional to 1/(plx)^4. So looking at the options, option A is ~1/plx^4. But wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the substitution.

Wait, because I think I might have confused the variables. Let me write this more carefully.

The number of stars in a thin shell at distance d with thickness dd is N = n * 4 π d² dd.

We want to express N in terms of plx. Since plx = 1/d, so d = 1/plx. So, d² = 1/(plx)^2.

Now, express dd in terms of dplx. Since d = 1/plx, dd = - (d plx) / (plx)^2. The negative is because as plx increases, d decreases. But since we're interested in the magnitude, dd = (d plx)/(plx^2) = (d plx)/(d^2) ) because plx = 1/d. So, plugging in, d plx = d * (1/d) )= 1? Wait, that can't be right. Let me recompute.

Wait, d = 1/plx. So, dd = derivative of d with respect to plx.

dd/dplx = derivative of (1/plx) with respect to plx. That's -1/(plx^2). So, dd = - (1/plx^2) dplx.

But since we're considering a small change in plx, dplx is positive, but as plx increases, d decreases, so dd is negative. But for the number of stars, I think we take the absolute value, so dd = (1/plx^2) dplx.

So now, substituting back into N:

N = n * 4 π (1/(plx)^2) * (d plx / (plx^2)) )

= n * 4 π (1/(plx^4)) d plx.

So, the number of stars per unit plx (d plx) is proportional to 1/(plx^4). So the number per unit plx range is proportional to 1/plx^4.

So looking back at the options, option A is ~1/plx^4.

But wait, I'm a bit confused because I thought the number of stars per unit volume in space is n, and each shell at distance d has a certain volume. But perhaps another way to think about it is in terms of the distribution in parallax space.

Alternatively, considering that the number of stars in a range of parallax dplx around plx is proportional to the volume per unit plx.

Wait, perhaps we can express the number density in terms of parallax.

The number of stars in a thin slice of parallax, d plx, would be the number of stars in the corresponding volume.

But since volume in space is 4π d² dd, and dd = (d plx)/(d²) )= plx^2 d plx. Wait, because d = 1/plx, so dd = d plx / (d^2) )= (d plx) * plx². Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused.

Wait, another approach: the volume between plx and plx + dplx is the volume of a shell at d = 1/plx, with thickness dr = dd = (d plx)/(d^2). Hmm, because if plx = 1/d, then d = 1/plx. So, the volume of a shell at radius d with thickness dr is 4 pi d² dr.

Which is 4 pi (1/plx)^2 * dr.

But dr is the change in distance. Since plx = 1/d, d plx = - (1/d²) dr → dr = - d² d plx. But again, taking magnitude, dr = (1/(plx)^2) d plx.

So substituting dr into volume: 4 pi (1/plx)^2 * (1/plx^2) d plx.

That's 4 pi (1/plx^4) d plx.

So the number of stars in this volume is n * 4 pi (1/plx^4) d plx.

So the number of stars per unit plx (d plx) is proportional to 1/plx^4.

Which matches option A.

Wait, but I think I'm perhaps missing something here. Let me think again.

Wait, the number of stars in a thin shell of radius r and thickness dr is n * 4 pi r² dr. So, if I want the number per unit dr, it's n *4 pi r².

But when we look at it in terms of plx, since r = 1/plx, so r² = 1/(plx)^2, and dr = - (1/(plx^2)) d plx. So number per unit plx is n *4 pi (1/(plx^2)) * (1/(plx^2)) )= n *4 pi / plx^4.

Yes, so this seems correct. So the number of stars per unit plx is proportional to 1/(plx^4). So the answer should be A.


To determine how the number of stars per unit range of parallax (plx) changes with plx, we start by noting that parallax is inversely proportional to distance: \( \text{plx} = \frac{1}{d} \), where \( d \) is the distance in parsecs. Assuming stars are uniformly distributed in space, the number density of stars is constant, denoted as \( n \). 

The number of stars in a thin shell at distance \( d \) with thickness \( dd \) is given by:

\[
N = n \cdot 4\pi d^2 \, dd
\]

Since \( \text{plx} = \frac{1}{d} \), we can express \( d \) and \( dd \) in terms of \( \text{plx} \). Substituting \( d = \frac{1}{\text{plx}} \), we find:

\[
d^2 = \frac{1}{\text{plx}^2}, \quad dd = -\frac{d \cdot d\text{plx}}{\text{plx}^2} = -\frac{1}{\text{plx}^2} \, d\text{plx}
\]

Substituting these into the expression for \( N \), we get:

\[
N = n \cdot 4\pi \cdot \frac{1}{\text{plx}^2} \cdot \frac{1}{\text{plx}^2} \, d\text{plx} = n \cdot \frac{4\pi}{\text{plx}^4} \, d\text{plx}
\]

Thus, the number of stars per unit range of \( \text{plx} \) is proportional to \( \frac{1}{\text{plx}^4} \).

From the given options:

- **A) \( \sim \frac{1}{\text{plx}^4} \)**: Matches the derived result.
- **B) \( \sim \frac{1}{\text{plx}^2} \)**: Incorrect, as the dependence is stronger than \( \frac{1}{\text{plx}^2} \).
- **C) \( \sim \frac{1}{\text{plx}^1} \)**: Incorrect, as the dependence is stronger than \( \frac{1}{\text{plx}} \).
- **D) \( \sim \frac{1}{\text{plx}^3} \)**: Incorrect, as the dependence is stronger than \( \frac{1}{\text{plx}^3} \).

The correct answer is therefore:

**Answer: A**
