Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question is asking.

Alright, the problem is about finding the uncertainty in the P_z operator, ΔP_z. The system is in an eigenstate of P_x with eigenvalue -ħ. The state is given as a column vector: (-1/2, 1/√2, -1/2). The basis vectors are the eigenvectors of P_z. So, the basis states are the eigenstates of P_z, which probably means they're aligned along the z-axis.

I remember that the uncertainty in an observable is calculated using the expectation values. The formula is ΔP_z = sqrt( <P_z²> - <P_z>² ). So I need to find the expectation value of P_z and the expectation value of P_z squared.

But wait, the system is in an eigenstate of P_x. That might complicate things because the state is not an eigenstate of P_z. So measuring P_z when the system is in a P_x eigenstate would give a probabilistic outcome, which is where the uncertainty comes from.

First, I think I should compute <P_z>. That's the expectation value of P_z. Since the state is a vector, I can compute this by multiplying the vector with P_z matrix and then taking the inner product, or perhaps using the bra-ket notation.

Wait, the state is given as a column vector. The expectation value is the conjugate transpose (bra) multiplied by P_z matrix multiplied by the state (ket). But looking at the given state, it's [ -1/2, 1/√2, -1/2 ]^T. Are these real numbers? Let me check: -1/2 is real, 1/√2 is real, and so is the last term. So the conjugate transpose would be the same as the transpose.

So let me write down the matrix P_z. It's given as:

P_z matrix:
Row 1: [ħ, 0, 0]
Row 2: [0, 0, 0]
Row 3: [0, 0, -ħ]

So the matrix is diagonal. That makes sense because for P_z, the eigenstates are the basis states, so the matrix is diagonal in this basis.

To compute <P_z>, I can take the state vector, multiply it by P_z, then take the dot product with the state vector.

Alternatively, since the matrix is diagonal, each component of the state vector is multiplied by the corresponding diagonal element of P_z.

Wait, the state is a column vector ψ = [a, b, c]^T where a = -1/2, b=1/√2, c=-1/2.

Then, P_z * ψ would be [ħ*a, 0*b, (-ħ)*c]^T.

So the expectation value is ψ† (P_z ψ) = a*(ħ a) + b*(0) + c*(-ħ c).

So let's compute that:

a = -1/2, so a*(ħ a) = (-1/2) * ħ * (-1/2) = (1/4) ħ.

c = -1
