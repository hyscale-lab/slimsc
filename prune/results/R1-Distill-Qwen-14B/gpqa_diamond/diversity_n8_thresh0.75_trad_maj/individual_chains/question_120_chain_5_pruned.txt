Okay, so I've got this question about stars and their distribution in the sky. Hmm, let me think. The question is about how the number of stars per unit range of parallax changes with the parallax itself. The options are from A to D, each with different exponents.

Wait, I remember parallax is related to distance. Parallax (plx) is the apparent shift in position of a star as observed from Earth as we orbit the sun. The formula I think is plx = 1/distance, where distance is in parsecs. So if a star is farther away, its parallax is smaller.

But the question is about the number of stars per unit parallax. So I guess we need to figure out how the number of stars in a certain range of parallax (like between plx and plx + dplx) depends on plx.

Assuming stars are uniformly distributed in space. Uniformly distributed probably means that the number density of stars (number per unit volume) is constant. So n is a constant.

Wait, volume. Because stars are spread out in three dimensions, the number of stars in a volume depends on the size of that volume. So, if I consider a shell at a certain distance, the volume of that shell would determine how many stars are in it.

The number of stars in such a shell would be n multiplied by the volume of the shell. Volume of a spherical shell (like between distance d and d+dd) is 4πd² dd. So N = n * 4πd² dd.

But the question is about parallax. Since plx = 1/d, so d = 1/plx. Let's substitute that. So d is inversely proportional to plx.

So substituting, d = 1/plx. Then, d squared is 1/(plx)^2. And dd would be the change in d, which is -d plx squared times the change in plx. Wait, maybe I should relate dd and dplx.

Let me think. Let’s say plx = 1/d → d = 1/plx. So when plx changes by a small amount dplx, d changes by dd = - (1/plx²) dplx. So the change in d, dd, is proportional to dplx over plx squared.

But the volume depends on d squared times dd. Let's see:

Volume = 4π d² dd.

Substituting d = 1/plx and dd = (d plx)/ (plx^2) → Wait, no, let's do this more carefully.

If plx = 1/d, then d = 1/plx → d = plx^(-1).

Taking the derivative with respect to plx: dd/dplx = - (1/plx²).

So, dd = - (1/plx²) dplx.

But when considering a thin shell, the thickness in distance space is dd
