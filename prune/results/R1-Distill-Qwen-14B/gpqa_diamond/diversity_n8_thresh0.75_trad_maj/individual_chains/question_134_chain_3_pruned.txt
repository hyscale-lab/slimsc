Okay, so I have this problem about calculating the enthalpy of neutralization when three solutions are mixed. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's see. I'll try to break it down step by step.

First, I remember that enthalpy of neutralization is the heat released when an acid reacts with a base to form water. The key here is to figure out the limiting reactant because the amount of heat released depends on that.

The acids given are HCl and H2SO4. Wait, HCl is a strong acid, so it will dissociate completely. H2SO4 is a strong acid too, but I think only the first dissociation is complete, so each molecule gives one H+ ion. Oh, but wait, no, wait. H2SO4 as a diprotic acid, but in dilute solutions, the first H+ is completely dissociated, and the second is only partially. But in this problem, since it's a neutralization reaction with a base, perhaps only the first H+ is reacting. Or maybe I should consider all available H+ ions from the acids.

The base is Ba(OH)2. I think Ba(OH)2 dissociates into Ba^2+ and 2 OH^- ions. So each mole of Ba(OH)2 provides two OH- ions.

So the plan is: calculate moles of H+ from each acid and moles of OH- from the base. Then find the limiting reagent because the neutralization depends on the availability of H+ and OH-.

Let's compute moles for each.

For HCl: it's 0.2 M in 500 mL. Moles = Molarity * Volume (in liters). So 0.2 * 0.5 = 0.1 moles of HCl. Each HCl gives one H+, so 0.1 moles H+.

H2SO4: 0.3 M in 300 mL. Moles = 0.3 * 0.3 = 0.09 moles H2SO4. Each gives one H+ (since we're considering first dissociation), so 0.09 moles H+.

Wait, but wait. Wait, wait. H2SO4 is a strong acid, so in solution, it completely dissociates into 2 H+ and SO4^2-? No, wait, no. Wait, that's a confusion point. For concentrated H2SO4, the first H+ is completely dissociated, and the second is not. But for dilute solutions, like in this problem, I think the first H+ is fully dissociated, and the second is only partially. But in neutralization reactions
