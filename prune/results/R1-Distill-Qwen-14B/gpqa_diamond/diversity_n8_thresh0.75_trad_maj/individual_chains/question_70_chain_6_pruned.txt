Alright, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me start by breaking down the information given.

The problem describes several reactions and then asks about the molecular symmetry group of product E. The options are various symmetry groups: C2, D4h, D∞h, C2v.

First, I'll try to outline what each reaction tells me.

1. Solid A reacts with 8 equivalents of gas B to form bright red product C.
   - So, the reaction is A + 8B → C (bright red)
   - This suggests that A is probably something that reacts in an 8:1 ratio. Maybe a metal reacting with a halogen? Like sodium reacting with chlorine? But wait, sodium would be A, and chlorine gas would be B. But sodium plus 8 Cl? That would form NaCl, but that's 1:1. Hmm, maybe it's something else. Let me think. If A is a transition metal with a +2 charge, then 8 equivalents of B (maybe a -1 ion) would form 4 B per A. Wait, maybe A is something like Fe, and B is Cl2? If it's Fe reacting with Cl2, but I'm not sure about the stoichiometry. Alternatively, maybe A is a metal that forms an 8:1 ratio, like perhaps something with a +1 charge reacting with a diatomic gas. For example, Li (A) reacting with Cl2 (B) in a 8:1 ratio? Wait, Li + Cl2 forms LiCl. Let's see: 2 Li + Cl2 → 2 LiCl. So that's a 2:1 ratio. Not 8:1. Hmm.

Wait another thought: perhaps A is a metal oxide? Or maybe a metal that forms a complex ion. Alternatively, maybe A is a metal, and B is a diatomic gas that reacts in a way that each molecule provides multiple atoms. For example, if B is O2, but how would that fit with 8 equivalents? Wait, but O2 is a diatomic molecule, so 8 equivalents would be 8 molecules. Alternatively, maybe A is Fe, and B is Cl2. Fe reacts with Cl2 in a certain ratio. Let me think: Fe + Cl2 → FeCl3. The reaction is 2 Fe + 3 Cl2 → 2 FeCl3. So that's 3/2 equivalents of Cl2 per Fe. Not matching 8 equivalents. Hmm. Maybe A is Al? Al reacts with Cl2 to form AlCl3. The reaction is
