Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen in product 3. Let's break it down step by step.

The starting material is 1,3-dibromoadamantane. I remember adamantane has a diamondoid structure, which is pretty rigid. So 1,3-dibromoadamantane would have bromine atoms on two non-adjacent carbons of the adamantane skeleton.

Heating this with excess KOH at 240°C. KOH is a strong base, and when dealing with dihalides, especially vicinal dihalides, it can lead to elimination reactions. Wait, but adamantane is a polycyclic structure, so where would elimination happen? Oh wait, maybe it's an E2 mechanism, but in adamantane, the structure is so rigid that elimination might form a bridge. Alternatively, perhaps it's a substitution reaction? Or maybe it's dehydrohalogenation, forming an alkene? But wait, 1,3-dibromoadamantane has two bromines on opposite ends of the adamantane. Oh, wait, perhaps when KOH is used, it's a double elimination to form an alkyne? Hmm, I'm a bit confused.

Wait, the product is a light yellow solid. The IR shows a peak at 1720 cm-1. That's indicative of a carbonyl group, maybe an ester or ketone. Wait, but if the starting material is dibromide, and KOH is used, perhaps it's a dehydrohalogenation, but for vicinal dihalides, elimination would form an alkene. But with KOH, maybe it's a substitution reaction? Alternatively, maybe the bromides are undergoing elimination to form a double bond, but then the IR wouldn't show a carbonyl. Hmm, maybe I'm missing something.

Wait, another possibility: the reaction could be a double elimination from 1,3-dibromoadamantane to form an alkyne. Because when two vicinal dihalides (like 1,2-dibromo) eliminate twice, you can get an alkyne. But wait, 1,3-dibromoadamantane isn't vicinal. Oh, wait, perhaps I'm mixing up the positions. Adamantane has four equivalent bridges. Maybe 1,3-dibromoadamantane is such that the two bromines are on opposite faces, allowing for elimination to form a triple bond.

Wait, the product after KOH is a carbonyl compound. Wait, but an alkyne's IR would have a peak around 2200 cm-1. So the 1720 cm-1 is more like a ketone or ester. So maybe the product is a ketone. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction isn't elimination but substitution.

Wait, KOH could cause a substitution. But since there are two bromines, perhaps it's a double substitution, but that would require a very strong base. Alternatively, maybe one substitution occurs, but that would give a bromoalkoxide, which might not form a stable carbonyl.

Hmm, perhaps I'm thinking about this wrong. Maybe the reaction isn't elimination but a substitution leading to a diol? No, because the IR doesn't show OH stretches. Wait, but the IR in the question is 1720, which is more likely a carbonyl. Oh, wait, maybe it's a Dieckmann cyclization? No, that's for esters. Alternatively, maybe it's an epoxide opening, but that doesn't fit. Or perhaps it's a nucleophilic substitution that forms an ester or ketone.

Wait, another approach. The NMR data after KOH is given. Let's look at that.

1H NMR of product 1: 4.79 ppm (2H), 2.41-2.23 (10H), 1.94 (2H).

So 4.79 ppm is probably an OCH2 group. Because in an ester or ether, the oxygenated CH2 would be around there. The 2.41-2.23 multiplet for 10H suggests maybe some equivalent CH2 groups in a rigid structure, like adamantane. The 1.94 ppm for 2H—maybe another CH2 group attached to something.

If the IR is 1720, which is a strong carbonyl, perhaps it's an ester. So, product 1 might be an ester derived from the dihalide.

Wait, but how would dihalide form an ester? Oh, maybe it's a nucleophilic substitution where the bromides are replaced by oxygen-based groups. Wait, but you can't get two ester groups from dihalide without some other reagent.

Wait, wait. KOH could deprotonate something, but in this case, maybe the dihalide is undergoing elimination to form a carbonyl. Oh, wait, elimination of HBr twice would form a triple bond, but that wouldn't give a carbonyl. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a substitution where each Br is replaced by an O-H from the KOH, but that would form a diol, which would have OH in the NMR, but the NMR doesn't show any broad signals, so maybe it's not a diol. Hmm.

Wait, another thought. If KOH is used under high temperature, perhaps it's a dehydrohalogenation to form a ketone. How? If the dihalide is on adjacent carbons (but in adamantane, 1,3 are not adjacent), so maybe it's a different mechanism. Alternatively, perhaps the dihalide is cleaved by KOH, leading to the formation of a carbonyl.

Wait, I'm a bit stuck here. Let me think again. Another approach is to think about the next steps. Product 1 is then heated with excess aluminum isopropoxide to form product 2. Aluminum isopropoxide is typically a Lewis acid catalyst, often used in Friedel-Crafts alkylation or acylation. But if product 1 is an ester, maybe it's undergoing some kind of acylation. Alternatively, perhaps it's a Diels-Alder type reaction, but I'm not sure.

Then, product 2 is ozonolysed at -78°C, followed by dimethyl sulfide. Ozonolysis tends to cleave double bonds. If product 2 has a double bond, ozonolysis would break it into carbonyl groups. But wait, the product after ozonolysis is product 3, which is the focus of the NMR question.

So, the overall process:

1,3-dibromoadamantane → (KOH, heat) → product 1 (ester or ketone, perhaps) → (Al(OiPr)3, heat) → product 2 → (O3, -78°C, DMS) → product 3.

Let me think about each step again.

Step 1: 1,3-dibromoadamantane + KOH → product 1.

The NMR of product 1 has an OCH2 group, because 4.79 ppm is typical for OCH2. The 2.41-2.23 suggests some CH2 groups in a rigid structure, perhaps the adamantane skeleton. The 1.94 ppm is maybe another CH2 group connected to the oxygen.

So maybe product 1 is a diethyl ether derivative, but with a carbonyl? Alternatively, perhaps the KOH is causing the formation of an epoxide, but that doesn't fit the IR.

Wait, another possibility: The dihalide 1,3-dibromoadamantane undergoes dehydrohalogenation to form an alkyne. Each Br is on a bridgehead carbon, and elimination would form a triple bond. So product 1 would be adamantane-1,3-diyne? But then the IR would have a peak around 2200 cm-1, not 1720. Hmm, that doesn't fit.

Wait, maybe the product is a ketone. How can a dihalide become a ketone? Perhaps via a substitution where two bromides are replaced with oxygen. But that would require a dihydroxylation, which would form a vicinal diol, but that's not the case here.

Alternatively, perhaps the dihalide is treated with a strong base like KOH, leading to elimination of HBr twice, forming a triple bond. But then the IR wouldn't have a carbonyl. Wait, maybe it's not elimination but substitution. Maybe each Br is replaced by an OH, forming a diol. But then the NMR would show broad O-H signals, which aren't mentioned.

Wait, another thought. Maybe the product is an epoxide, but that would have an oxygen ring and the IR would show a peak around 1200 cm-1, not 1720.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a cyclopropane derivative. No, that doesn't fit the IR.

Hmm. Let me think again. The IR at 1720 cm-1 is a strong carbonyl. So product 1 must have a carbonyl group. So maybe the dihalide is converted into a ketone via some mechanism.

Wait, perhaps it's a dehydrohalogenation but with a different outcome. For example, if the dihalide is 1,2-dibromo, elimination would form an alkene. But in this case, it's 1,3-dibromo. Wait, maybe the elimination forms a conjugated diene, but that's possible only if the structure allows for that. But how would that lead to a ketone?

Alternatively, perhaps the dihalide is treated with KOH in a way that it forms a ketone via a double substitution. But I can't recall a mechanism where two bromides are replaced by a single oxygen to form a ketone. Wait, that's possible via a nucleophilic attack where two equivalents of hydroxide attack adjacent carbons, leading to a gem-diol, which then loses water to form a carbonyl.

Wait, the reaction of 1,3-dibromoadamantane with KOH could lead to the formation of a diol, which then dehydrates to form a carbonyl. But in the case of 1,3-dibromo, the diol would be 1,3-diol. When such a diol is heated, could it undergo cyclization or dehydration? Wait, 1,3-diols can form cyclic ketones via keto-enol tautomerism, but that's usually for 1,2-diols. Hmm, not sure.

Wait, another angle: The NMR of product 1. The 4.79 ppm (2H) is likely an oxygen-bearing CH2 group, perhaps OCH2CH2O or OCH2. The 10H in the 2.4-2.23 range might be the remaining adamantane structure. The 1.94 (2H) could be another CH2 near the oxygen. So perhaps product 1 is an ester, like an adamantyl ester.

Wait, but how would dihalide become an ester? Maybe via the formation of a glycol, but I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a diepoxide, but that's not matching the IR.

Wait, another thought: Maybe the dihalide is alkali treated to form a ketone via a double elimination. Wait, but for that, the dihalide would need to be vicinal. Since 1,3-dibromoadamantane isn't vicinal, elimination isn't straightforward. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the dihalide undergoes a substitution reaction where each Br is replaced by an OR group. But that would require two equivalents of an alcohol (like ethanol), but the question says KOH is in excess. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the product is a geminal diether, but that would have two OCH3 groups or something, but the NMR doesn't show that.

Alternatively, maybe product 1 is a ketone and the NMR is showing the OCH2 from some other group. Wait, perhaps the KOH is causing a ring-opening of the adamantane, but that seems unlikely.

I'm getting stuck on step one. Maybe I should proceed and see if that helps. So, step two: product 1 is heated with excess Al(OiPr)3. Al(OiPr)3 is a Lewis acid, used in Friedel-Crafts acylation or alkylation. So product 1 must have a carbonyl group, perhaps an acyl group, which could acylate something else. Or perhaps it's an acylation of benzene, but without aromatic rings, maybe it's another structure.

Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is a ketone. When a ketone is treated with Al(OiPr)3, maybe it's undergoing some kind of cyclization or a Friedel-Crafts-like reaction, but without an aromatic ring, I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is an ester, and Al(OiPr)3 is used to perform an acylation on another molecule, leading to product 2.

Wait, but I'm not seeing the connection. Let me think about step three: product 2 undergoes ozonolysis. Ozonolysis cleaves double bonds into carbonyl groups. So product 2 must have a double bond.

Putting this together: product 2 has a double bond, so product 1, when treated with Al(OiPr)3, must have formed a double bond. Alternatively, product 1 might have a carbonyl group that, when treated with a Lewis acid, forms an enol ether or an alkene via an elimination.

Wait, another possibility: if product 1 is an ester, then Al(OiPr)3 could facilitate the formation of an acyl chloride, but that's not typically done because Al(OiPr)3 isn't a strong enough Lewis acid for that. Alternatively, perhaps it's a Claisen rearrangement, but I don't think that applies here.

Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is a cyclic ketone, and Al(OiPr)3 is used to form an enol ether, which upon dehydration forms a double bond.

Wait, perhaps product 1 is a cyclohexenone derivative, but that's a stretch.

Alternatively, maybe product 1 is a diester, but I'm not sure.

Let me think again about the first step. The IR has a peak at 1720 cm-1, which is a strong carbonyl. So perhaps product 1 is a ketone.

How would 1,3-dibromoadamantane become a ketone when treated with KOH?

Wait, perhaps it's a double elimination, but formation of a ketone from a dihalide. Wait, think of the mechanism where two adjacent bromides are eliminated as HBr, forming a carbonyl group. But 1,3-dibromoadamantane isn't adjacent. Wait, maybe it's a ring-opening elimination.

Wait, another approach. If the starting material is 1,3-dibromoadamantane and the product is a ketone, perhaps two HBr are eliminated, but from adjacent carbons. But in 1,3 positions, they are not adjacent. Unless the compound is such that the bromines are on bridgeheads, and elimination can form a bridgehead carbonyl.

Wait, but in adamantane, bridgehead positions can't have double bonds because of Bredt's rule. So a carbonyl at bridgehead is possible, though.

Hmm, perhaps the dihalide is 1,3-dibromoadamantane, and upon treatment with KOH, each Br is replaced by an O- group, forming a diol, which then loses water to form a ketone. Wait, but 1,3 diol would have two OH groups on opposite bridgeheads. Losing water would require proximity, which bridgeheads don't have. So that's probably not feasible.

Alternatively, perhaps the dihalide undergoes elimination to form a conjugated diene, but that doesn't form a carbonyl.

Wait, this is getting too complicated. Maybe I should accept that product 1 is a ketone and move forward.

So product 1 is a ketone, perhaps an adamantyl ketone. Then, product 1 is treated with Al(OiPr)3, which is a Lewis acid. Maybe it's used to form an enol ether from the ketone. Enol ethers have double bonds adjacent to oxygen. So product 2 would have a double bond.

Then, product 2 undergoes ozonolysis, which cleaves the double bond into two carbonyl groups. So product 3 would have two carbonyl groups, maybe ketones or aldehydes, depending on the structure.

But let's get back to the NMR of product 3. The question is about the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen in product 3.

Assuming product 3 has a carbonyl group, the most deshielded hydrogen would be adjacent to the carbonyl, like an alpha hydrogen. Or perhaps it's a more deshielded environment due to proximity to electronegative groups.

In ozonolysis, the double bond is cleaved, and each end forms a carbonyl. So for a simple alkene like R1R2C=CR3R4, ozonolysis would give R1R2CO and R3R4CO.

But in the case of product 2, perhaps the double bond is part of a ring or a more complex structure. For example, if product 2 is a bicyclic compound with a double bond, ozonolysis would break it into smaller fragments.

Wait, in product 3, after ozonolysis and workup with DMS (which is a reductive workup, I think), the carbonyl groups would be formed without further oxidation. DMS is typically used to prevent the formation of ozonides and to cleave the ozonides into aldehydes or ketones.

So, the product 3 would have two carbonyl groups, each coming from the cleavage of the double bond.

But how does that relate to the NMR?

The most deshielded hydrogen in product 3 would likely be adjacent to the carbonyl group. So, for example, if there's a CH2 group next to the carbonyl, the hydrogen would be deshielded and appear downfield.

But the question is about the coupling pattern of this hydrogen. So, how many neighboring hydrogens does it have, and what's their splitting?

Let's say the ozonolysis breaks a double bond into two carbonyl groups. Suppose each carbonyl is adjacent to a CH2 group. Then each of those CH2 hydrogens would be next to the carbonyl.

But in the NMR, each hydrogen in the CH2 would split into a certain pattern based on neighboring hydrogens.

Wait, perhaps the structure after ozonolysis leads to a molecule with a CH2 group adjacent to a carbonyl. Let's say the structure is RCO-CH2-CH2-COR'. Then the CH2 groups next to the carbonyl would have how many neighboring hydrogens?

Alternatively, if the ozonolysis product has a structure like (CH2)nCO, where n is 1 or more, the hydrogen adjacent would be a CH2 next to the carbonyl.

Wait, perhaps the product is a diketone, like something with two ketone groups. In that case, the most deshielded hydrogens would be the ones next to the carbonyls.

But the coupling pattern depends on the environment. For example, if the hydrogen is next to a CH2 group, it would split into a triplet.

Wait, let's think with a specific example. Suppose the ozonolysis of product 2 (which has a double bond) gives a molecule with a structure like CH2(CO)CH2(CO)R. Then, the central CH2 would have two neighboring CH2 groups, each with two hydrogens.

Wait, maybe not. Alternatively, if the ozonolysis breaks a five-membered ring, giving two ketones with CH2 groups adjacent.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is such that the most deshielded hydrogen is part of a CH2 group next to two other CH2 groups. So the hydrogen would have neighboring hydrogens on adjacent carbons.

Wait, let's imagine that. Suppose in product 3, the structure is:

O=C-(CH2)2-C=O

But that's more of a symmetrical structure. The CH2 in the middle would be adjacent to two CH2 groups on either side. So each hydrogen in the middle CH2 would have neighboring hydrogens on both adjacent CH2 groups.

So each H in the middle would be split by the neighboring hydrogens. Let's see: each CH2 group has two H's. So the middle CH2 has two neighboring CH2 groups, each with two H's.

But the coupling would involve more than one neighbor. Let me think about this.

The middle CH2 would have neighboring H's from each adjacent CH2. Each adjacent CH2 has two H's, so the coupling would be to two sets of H's. The number of peaks would be 2 +1 = 3 from each adjacent group. But since both are adjacent, perhaps the splitting is more complex.

Wait, but when a hydrogen is split by two different sets of neighboring hydrogens, each with a different coupling constant, the splitting becomes a doublet of doublets, or more. Alternatively, if the coupling constants are similar, it could be a triplet of triplets.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Let me think of a simpler structure. Suppose the structure is CH2-CH2-CH2, but with the middle CH2 next to two CH2 groups.

Wait, perhaps the most deshielded hydrogen is in a CH2 group that's adjacent to two other CH2 groups. So, for each adjacent group, the coupling would be J1 and J2. Each J would cause splitting. So the number of peaks would be (n+1)(m+1), where n and m are the number of neighboring H's in each adjacent group.

But in this case, each adjacent group has 2 H's. So each would cause a triplet. But wait, each H in the adjacent groups would couple with the central H, leading to a triplet from each coupling. But since both couplings are present, the overall splitting would be a doublet of doublets, or perhaps a triplet of triplets.

Wait, no, perhaps it's a triplet of triplets. Because each coupling (from each adjacent CH2) would cause a splitting into triplets. So the first coupling (from one adjacent CH2) would split the peak into a triplet, and then each of those peaks would be further split by the second coupling, leading to a triplet of triplets.

But wait, that would be if there are two separate coupling constants. Alternatively, if the two couplings are similar, maybe it appears as a pentet.

Wait, no, a pentet comes from coupling with four equivalent H's. For example, if a CH3 group is adjacent, you get a quartet. But in our case, if each adjacent group has two H's, each with a different J, then it would be a triplet of triplets.

Alternatively, if the two adjacent groups are identical, perhaps it would simplify to a triplet, but that seems unlikely.

Wait, let me think of ethyl groups. If a CH2 is next to two CH2 groups, each with two H's, then each adjacent CH2 would cause a triplet. So the first CH2 would split the peak into a triplet, and the second would split each of those into another triplet, resulting in 3×3=9 peaks, which is a nonet. But that's not an option here.

Alternatively, perhaps the scenario is different. Maybe the most deshielded hydrogen is in a vinyl group, but that's unlikely because ozonolysis would break the double bond.

Wait, perhaps the structure is such that the most deshielded hydrogen is adjacent to a CH2 group, which in turn is adjacent to another CH2 group. So, for example, the structure might be (CH2)3CO. Then, the CH2 next to CO would have two neighboring H's on one side and two on the other. So each H would couple with two sets of two H's, leading to a triplet of triplets.

But wait, perhaps the numbers are different. Let me imagine the structure: CO-CH2-CH2-CH2-... Then, the central CH2 would have neighboring CH2 groups on either side. Each CH2 has two H's, so each would cause a triplet. But perhaps the splitting isn't that complex because the coupling constants might be similar.

Alternatively, if the hydrogen is only adjacent to one CH2 group, then it would be a triplet. But the question specifies the most deshielded hydrogen, which is probably next to more than one set of H's.

Wait, maybe the structure is something like CH2(CO)CH2CH2CH2CO. Then, the CH2 groups in the middle would have neighboring groups on either side. The end CH2 may have only one neighbor, but the middle CH2 has two.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let's think about the options given.

The options are: A) triplet, B) triplet of triplets, C) doublet of triplets, D) pentet.

So, if the hydrogen is coupled to two sets of two equivalent H's, each with the same J, perhaps it would be a triplet of triplets.

But wait, I think it's more likely that the splitting is a triplet of triplets. Let me try to model that.

Consider a hydrogen (H1) that is adjacent to two CH2 groups, each with two H's. Each CH2 group (let's call them CH2a and CH2b) is adjacent to H1.

The coupling between H1 and CH2a would split H1 into a triplet. Each of those peaks would then be further split by coupling with CH2b, also a triplet. So the overall pattern would be a triplet of triplets.

But wait, another possibility is that H1 is adjacent to two different CH2 groups, each with two H's, but their coupling constants are different. In that case, the splitting would be a doublet of doublets, but that's not one of the options. However, option B is triplet of triplets.

Alternatively, if the two adjacent groups are identical, perhaps the splitting would be a triplet of triplets because each CH2 contributes a triplet.

Wait, but if the two adjacent groups are identical, maybe the splitting would be a quintet, but that's not the case here.

Alternatively, perhaps the hydrogen is adjacent to two different types of H's. For example, if it's next to a CH and a CH2, but that's speculative.

Alternatively, perhaps the hydrogen is part of a CH2 group next to a CH group. For example, the structure might be (CH2)COCH2CH2CO. Then, the central CH2 would have a CH2 on one side and a CH2 on the other. Each CH2's H's would cause splitting.

Wait, but without the exact structure, it's hard to be certain. But given the options, the most probable answer is that the coupling is a triplet of triplets, which is option B.


The problem involves determining the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen atom in product 3, formed through a series of reactions starting with 1,3-dibromoadamantane. Here's the analysis:

1. **Step 1: Reaction with KOH**  
   Heating 1,3-dibromoadamantane with KOH at 240°C produces a light yellow solid (product 1). The IR spectrum shows a strong absorbance at 1720 cm⁻¹, indicative of a carbonyl group. The NMR data (4.79 ppm, 2H; 2.41-2.23 ppm, 10H; 1.94 ppm, 2H) suggests the presence of an oxygenated CH₂ group (likely OCH₂) and a rigid adamantane-like structure. This indicates that product 1 is likely an ester or a ketone derived from the dihalide.

2. **Step 2: Reaction with Al(OiPr)₃**  
   Heating product 1 with excess aluminum isopropoxide (a Lewis acid) likely facilitates the formation of a compound with a double bond (product 2). This is inferred from the subsequent ozonolysis step, which targets double bonds.

3. **Step 3: Ozonolysis and Workup**  
   Ozonolysis of product 2 at -78°C, followed by addition of dimethyl sulfide, cleaves the double bond in product 2, forming product 3. Ozonolysis typically converts double bonds into carbonyl groups, so product 3 likely contains carbonyl-containing fragments.

4. **NMR Analysis of Product 3**  
   The most deshielded hydrogen in product 3 is likely adjacent to a carbonyl group. The coupling pattern depends on the number and arrangement of neighboring hydrogens. If the hydrogen is adjacent to two CH₂ groups, each with two hydrogens, the splitting would occur as follows:  
   - The first CH₂ group would split the signal into a triplet.  
   - The second CH₂ group would further split each of these peaks into a triplet again.  
   This results in a **triplet of triplets** coupling pattern.

Given the options, the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen atom in product 3 is best described as a **triplet of triplets**. 

Answer: B
