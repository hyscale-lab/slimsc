Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about elastic scattering of electrons. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's try to think it through.

The question gives me phase shifts for different angular momenta, I think. The phase shifts given are delta_0, delta_1, delta_2, etc. Wait, the measured phase shifts are δ₀=90°, δ₁=67°, δ₂=55°, δ₃=30°, and δ₄=13°. But the question says to ignore the rest, so I guess we only consider up to δ₄.

The problem is asking for the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude along the incident beam direction. Oh right, the scattering amplitude is usually denoted as f(θ), and in the context of partial waves, it can be expressed using the phase shifts. 

Wait, the scattering amplitude f is given by a sum over all angular momentum states. Each term involves the spherical harmonics and the exponential of i times the phase shift. But when considering the direction along the incident beam, that's probably at θ=0 degrees, right? Because the beam is along the initial direction, so when you measure scattering at θ=0, that's backscattering?

Wait no, wait. The question says "along the incident beam direction." That would be the forward direction, θ=0. Because when θ is 0, the angle is the same as the incident direction. Oh wait, no. No, the scattering angle is measured from the incident direction. So θ=0 is the direction of the incident beam, right? Or wait, in scattering, θ=0 would be when the particle scatters straight ahead, same direction as before, which is actually the forward direction. Or wait, maybe I'm confused. Oh, no, in the lab frame, the incident beam comes in, say from the left. The scattered particles are at an angle θ from the beam direction. So when θ is 0°, it's along the beam, which would be forward scattering.

But in any case, the problem is about the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude at the incident direction. So the formula for the scattering amplitude is f(θ) = sum_{l=0}^∞ (2l+1) [ (sin δ_l)/(sin δ_l) ) ... wait, no, the general form is f(θ) = sum (2l+1) e^{2iδ_l} [ ... ] where the [...] is the spherical harmonic or the associated Legendre polynomial part. But wait, wait, the partial wave expansion for the scattering amplitude is:

f(θ) = (1/(2ik)) sum_{l=0}^∞ (2l+1) [ e^{2iδ_l} - 1 ] P_l(cosθ) 

Wait, no, another formula comes to mind. The scattering amplitude in terms of the partial waves is given by:

f(θ) = (1/(2ik)) ∑_{l=0}^∞ (2l+1) [ e^{2iδ_l} - 1 ] P_l (cos θ)

But I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact expression. Wait, I think the formula is:

f(θ) = (1/(2ik)) * sum_{l} (2l+1) [ e^{2iδ_l} - 1 ] * P_l (cosθ)

Here, δ
