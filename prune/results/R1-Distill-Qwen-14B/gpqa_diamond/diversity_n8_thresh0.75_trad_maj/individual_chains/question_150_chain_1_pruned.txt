Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem in front of me. Let me try to figure this out step by step. I'm a bit new to this, but I'll give it a shot.

The question is about identifying the final product after a series of reactions based on the given NMR data and the reagents used. The molecular formula is C8H9NO. Hmm, that formula has 8 carbons, 9 hydrogens, one nitrogen, and one oxygen. Wait, let me think, the molecular formula might be a hint about the structure.

First, let me look at the NMR data. The 1H-NMR shows several peaks:

- 9.72 ppm as a triplet (t, 1H). That's a high chemical shift, probably an aldehyde proton. Aldehydes usually resonate around 9-10 ppm. So maybe there's an aldehyde group in the molecule.
- 6.98 ppm as a doublet (d, 2H). That's in the aromatic region. Maybe two protons as part of a substituted benzene ring. The doublet suggests coupling with one neighboring proton.
- 6.51 ppm as another doublet (d, 2H). Also aromatic, perhaps another set of protons in a para-substituted benzene ring? Because in para-substituted rings, the protons are equivalent and couple with each other, giving a doublet.
- 6.27 ppm as a broad singlet (bs, 2H). Broad usually indicates exchange with something, like an -OH proton. But wait, these are two protons. Maybe these are adjacent to oxygen, like in a dienol structure or something with two adjacent hydroxyl groups? Or perhaps they're part of a vinyl group near an oxygen?
- 3.66 ppm as a doublet (d, 2H). That's around where methylene groups adjacent to an oxygen (like OCH2) appear. So maybe a CH2 group next to an oxygen, maybe in an ether or ester linkage.

So putting this together, the molecule has an aldehyde group, an aromatic ring (maybe two, given the peaks), some oxygen-containing groups, and a methylene group.

The molecular formula is C8H9NO. Let's calculate the degree of unsaturation. Degree of unsaturation is (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. So here, C=8, H=9, N=1, O=1. So (2*8 +2 -9 -0 +1)/2 = (18-9+1)/2=10/2=5. So 5 degrees. That could be from a
