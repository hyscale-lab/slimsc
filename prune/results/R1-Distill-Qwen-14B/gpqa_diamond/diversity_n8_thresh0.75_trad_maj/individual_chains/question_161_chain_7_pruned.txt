Okay, so I've got this question about a transmission electron microscope (TEM) setup. Let me try to break it down.

Mike is working with a high-resolution TEM operating at 1000 kV. He's using vacuum pumps to get an ultra-high vacuum in the sample compartment, like less than 10^-9 Torr. The idea is to minimize gas molecules because if there's a lot of gas, the electrons from the beam would scatter off those gas particles, which would degrade the image quality. But despite the pumps, some gas molecules are still there, as detected by a mass spectrometer.

Mike calculated the mean free path of these gas molecules, λ1. The mean free path is the average distance a molecule travels between collisions. I remember that in a vacuum, when the pressure is low, the mean free path is longer because molecules don't hit each other as often. So, if the pressure is lower (like in a vacuum), λ1 would be longer.

But then, when he turns on the electron beam, the mean free path changes to λ2. And the question is, is this λ2 longer or shorter than λ1?

Wait, what happens when the electron beam is on. The electrons are moving really fast because the accelerating voltage is high (1000 kV is 1,000,000 volts, so they have a lot of kinetic energy). So, when the electrons are fired, they're moving through this gas, albeit at a very low pressure.

In the absence of the electron beam, the gas molecules are just moving around, colliding with each other and the walls. But when the electrons are moving through the gas, the electrons can also interact with the gas molecules. This interaction is scattering. So, the gas molecules now have another thing to collide with: the electrons.

Hmm, so the mean free path for the gas molecules would be the average distance they travel before colliding with anything. Without the electrons, the collisions are just between gas molecules. When electrons are present, the gas molecules can also collide with electrons. So, each gas molecule now has more potential for collisions—either with other gas molecules or with the electrons.

Wait, but wait, the mean free path is from the gas molecules' perspective. Or is it the electrons' mean free path? Wait, no, the question says that Mike accurately determined the mean free path of these gas molecules. So, λ1 is the mean free path of the gas molecules in the ultra-high vacuum before the beam is on. Then, when the beam is on,
