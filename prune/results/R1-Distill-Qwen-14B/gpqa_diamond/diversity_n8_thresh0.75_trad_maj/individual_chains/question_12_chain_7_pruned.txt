Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about finding the kinetic energy of the product particles in a decay process. Let me try to figure it out. Hmm, the question is about a pion decaying into a muon and a neutrino. The pion is at rest, which might make things a bit easier.

Wait, the reaction is Pi+ â†’ mu+ + nu. So the pion is the parent particle, and it decays into a muon and a neutrino. Both the muon and neutrino are the products. I need to find their kinetic energies.

I remember that in particle physics, when a particle at rest decays, the total energy and momentum must be conserved. Since the pion is at rest, the initial momentum is zero. So the total momentum of the products must also be zero. That means the momenta of the muon and neutrino must be equal in magnitude but opposite in direction.

Let me think about the four-momentum conservation. The initial four-momentum is just the rest mass of the pion because it's not moving. So the sum of the four-momenta of the muon and neutrino must equal the pion's rest mass.

Wait, the pion's rest mass is 139.6 MeV, and the muon's rest mass is 105.7 MeV. The neutrino is very light, but I think for this problem, we can consider its rest mass as zero. So the neutrino is effectively massless.

So, the system's total energy is the sum of the energies of the muon and neutrino, which should equal the pion's rest mass energy, 139.6 MeV.

But wait, each particle's energy is the sum of their rest mass energy and kinetic energy. So:

E_pion = E_mu + E_nu

E_pion is 139.6 MeV. But the muon has a rest mass of 105.7 MeV, and the neutrino's rest mass is negligible, so E_nu is just its kinetic energy.

Also, because momentum is conserved, the magnitudes of their momenta must be equal. Let me denote the magnitude of the muon's momentum as p, and the neutrino's as p as well, but opposite in direction.

So, the energy of each particle is:

E_mu = sqrt( (p c)^2 + (m_mu c^2)^2 ) / c^2? Wait, not sure about units here. Maybe it's better to work in units where c=1. Oh, right, in particle physics, units are often in MeV and MeV/c, so perhaps I can set c=1 for simplicity.

So E_mu = sqrt( p^2 + m_mu^2 ), and E_nu = p (since for neutrino, m_nu ~0, so E = p).

So the total energy is E_mu + E_nu = sqrt(p^2 + m_mu^2) + p = 139.6 MeV.

Hmm, that equation should let me solve for p. Let's write it down:

sqrt(p^2 + (105.7)^2) + p = 139.6

Let me denote (105.7)^2 as m_mu^2. Let me compute that: 105.7 * 105.7.
