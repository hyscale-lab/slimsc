Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, so I'll try to think it through step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The question is about finding the concentration of calcium ions in a solution. The solution contains 0.02 M of a stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex. They also give me the formation constant, K_Ca-EDTA, which is 5x10^10. The pH is ideal, and the temperature is 25°C.

Hmm, I remember that EDTA is a chelating agent, which means it binds metal ions like Ca²+ pretty tightly. The stoichiometric complex probably means that each Ca²+ is bound by one EDTA molecule, so the formula would be something like [Ca(EDTA)]^0 or something similar. But wait, the exact charge might not matter here because the problem is about concentration, not charge.

So, the solution is 0.02 M in the Ca-EDTA complex. I think the key here is to figure out how much of that complex dissociates to release Ca²+ ions into the solution. But wait, since EDTA forms a very stable complex, I would expect that the concentration of free Ca²+ ions is very low because most of it is tied up in the complex.

Wait, right, the formation constant (K) for the complex is given. The formation constant is the equilibrium constant for the reaction where the metal ion and EDTA combine to form the complex. So the reaction would look like:

Ca²+ + EDTA^4- ↔ [CaEDTA]^2−

But wait, I think the exact charges might vary, but the K is given as 5e10. So K = [CaEDTA]/([Ca²+][EDTA^4-]).

But wait, in this scenario, we have the complex already present at 0.02 M. So the initial concentration of the complex is 0.02 M. We can assume that some of this complex dissociates into Ca²+ and EDTA^4-.

Let me think about the dissociation. The concentration of the complex is much higher than the product of the concentrations of the ions because K is so large. So the reverse reaction (dissociation) is not favored. Hence, the concentration of free Ca²+ should be very low.

Wait, but how do I relate the concentration of the complex to the concentration of Ca²+?

I think the formula for the formation constant can be rearranged to solve for [Ca²+]. Let's write the K expression again:

K = [complex]/( [Ca²+][EDTA] )

But wait, since the solution is 0.02 M in the complex, and assuming that the dissociation is negligible, then the concentrations of Ca²+ and EDTA would be equal because each complex releases one Ca²+ and one EDTA. So [Ca²+] = [EDTA] = x.

Wait, but the initial EDTA concentration? No, because the complex is what's present. So initially, the EDTA outside the complex is zero? Or wait, that's not right. Because the complex is formed by Ca²+ and EDTA. So the complex dissociates a little.

Wait, perhaps another approach. Let me define the concentration of the complex as C_total = 0.02 M. The complex can dissociate as:

[CaEDTA]^2− ↔ Ca²+ + EDTA^4−

So, the initial concentration of the complex is 0.02 M, and the initial concentrations of Ca²+ and EDTA are zero. Let's let x be the concentration of Ca²+ that dissociates from the complex.

So, at equilibrium, [CaEDTA] = 0.02 - x ≈ 0.02 (since x is probably very small due to the large K), [Ca²+] = x, [EDTA] = x.

But wait, wait a second. The problem is about the formation of the complex. So K is given as 5e10, which is very large, meaning that the complex is very stable, so very little dissociation occurs. So x would be small compared to 0.02, so we can approximate [CaEDTA] ≈ 0.02.

So substituting into the K expression:

K = [CaEDTA]/( [Ca²+][EDTA] ) = (0.02) / (x * x ) = 0.02 / x².

We know K is 5e10, so 5e10 = 0.02 / x².

Solving for x²: x² = 0.02 / 5e10.

Let me compute that. 0.02 is 2e-2. So 2e-2 divided by 5e10 is (2e-2)/(5e10) = (2/5) * 1e-12 = 0.4e-12.

So x² = 0.4e-12 → x = sqrt(0.4e-12).

What's sqrt(0.4e
