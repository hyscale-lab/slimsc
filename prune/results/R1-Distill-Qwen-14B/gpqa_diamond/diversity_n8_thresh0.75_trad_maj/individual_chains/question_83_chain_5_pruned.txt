Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem to solve, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of titration calculations. Let's read the question carefully.

The problem says we're diluting 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid with 20.00 cm³ of water. Then, we titrate that diluted solution with 0.1 M NaOH. We need to find the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point. The options are A to D, each with two pH values.

Hmm, I remember that acetic acid is a weak acid, and NaOH is a strong base. So this is a weak acid-strong base titration. The key points here are dilution and then the titration steps.

First, let's think about the dilution. When we mix 20 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid with 20 cm³ of water, the total volume becomes 40 cm³. So the concentration after dilution can be calculated using the dilution formula: M1V1 = M2V2.

Wait, M1 is 0.05 M, V1 is 20 cm³, V2 is 40 cm³. So M2 = (0.05 *20)/40 = 0.025 M. So the diluted acetic acid is 0.025 M.

Next, the titration with 0.1 M NaOH. We need to find pH at 25% titration and at equivalence.

Let me think about the equivalence point first because that might be simpler. At equivalence, all the acetic acid has reacted with NaOH to form acetate ions and water.

So, how many moles of acetic acid do we have initially after dilution? The volume is 40 cm³, which is 0.04 L. So moles = Molarity × Volume = 0.025 M × 0.04 L = 0.001 mol.

Since the reaction is 1:1 (acetic acid + NaOH → sodium acetate + water), the moles of NaOH needed at equivalence would be 0.001 mol. But wait, the concentration of NaOH is 0.1 M, so volume = moles / concentration. That's 0.001 / 0.1 = 0.01 L = 10 cm³. So at equivalence, we've added 10 cm³ of NaOH.

At equivalence, the solution is sodium acetate, which is the conjugate base of acetic acid. So the solution will be basic. We can calculate the pH using the formula for a salt of a weak acid and strong base.

The acetate ion (C2H3O2^-) will hydrolyze in water: C2H3O2^- + H2O ↔ HC2H3O2 + OH^-.

The Kb for acetate can be found from Kw / Ka. Ka is given as 1.85e-5. So Kb = 1e-14 / 1.85e-5 ≈ 5.405e-10.

But wait, wait. Let me calculate that again. 1e-14 divided by 1.85e-5 is
