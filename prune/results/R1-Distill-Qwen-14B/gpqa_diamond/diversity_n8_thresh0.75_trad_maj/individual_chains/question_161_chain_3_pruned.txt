Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this question about electron microscopes and vacuum conditions. Let's see what I remember about mean free path and electron microscopy.

So, the question is about a high-resolution transmission electron microscope that Mike is designing. He's using a vacuum pump to get an ultra-high vacuum, less than 10^-9 Torr. That's super low pressure, right? The idea is that with such low pressure, there are very few gas molecules in the sample compartment. This is good because it minimizes things like electron scattering, which can degrade the image quality.

Mike determined the mean free path of the gas molecules as λ1. The mean free path is the average distance a molecule travels between collisions. In a vacuum, without many molecules around, the mean free path is longer. So λ1 is based on the pressure, temperature, and volume of the compartment.

Then, when he starts the electron beam, he notices that the mean free path changes. It's now λ2, and it's not the same as λ1. But the temperature is the same, so that shouldn't be the variable here.

Wait, why would the mean free path change when the electron beam is on? Hmm. Oh, right! When the electron beam is active, electrons are moving through the vacuum. These electrons can interact with the gas molecules in the compartment. 

Wait a second, the electrons are part of the beam, right? So if there are gas molecules present, the electrons could cause collisions with these molecules. But how does that affect the mean free path?

Mean free path depends on the number density of the gas molecules. The formula for mean free path is λ = 1/(√2 n π d²), where n is the number density and d is the molecular diameter. In the initial state, when the electron beam is off, the gas molecules are just sitting there, so their number density is low because of the ultra-high vacuum.

But when the electron beam is on, perhaps the electrons are causing more ionization or dissociation of the gas molecules. Oh wait, or maybe the electrons are creating additional gas atoms or ions. Like, if the gas molecules are hit by high-energy electrons, they might break apart into smaller particles or even ionize, increasing the number of particles in the compartment.

Alternatively, maybe the gas is getting heated by the electron beam. Wait, but the question states the temperature remains the same. So heating might not be the cause, unless the method of measuring temperature is different—like, maybe the beam doesn't change the gas's temperature but affects the
