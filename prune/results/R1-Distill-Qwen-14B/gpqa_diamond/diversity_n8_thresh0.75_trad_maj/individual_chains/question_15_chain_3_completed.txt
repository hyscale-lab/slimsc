Okay, so I've got this question about detecting exoplanets using the transit method. Hmm, I remember that the transit method involves a planet passing in front of its star from our point of view, causing a dip in brightness. The probability of this happening depends on the size of the planet and the star, and the orientation of the orbit.

The question says there are two planets, Planet_1 and Planet_2. Both are Earth-like and have already been detected via the radial velocity (RV) method. So we know their minimum masses and orbital periods. Their masses are the same. 

Wait, the orbital period of Planet_1 is three times shorter than Planet_2. So Planet_1 is closer to its star because a shorter orbital period means it's orbiting more quickly, which usually means a smaller orbit radius. 

The stars are both the same size because the host of Planet_2 is slightly evolved but they have the same radii. Interesting. So R_star1 equals R_star2. 

But the masses are different. Planet_1's host is twice as massive as Planet_2's. So M1 = 2*M2. 

We need to figure out which planet has a higher probability of transiting. The probability of a transit depends on the orbital inclination and the size of the planet relative to the star. The formula for the probability P is (R_planet + R_star) / a_planet. Wait, no, I think it's more accurate to say P = (R_*/ a) * (1/(1 + (M_planet/(M_*)^0.5))) or something? Wait, no, I might be mixing things up. Let me think again.

The transit probability is actually the chance that the planet's orbital plane is aligned with our line of sight. The formula I remember is P = (R_star / a_planet) * (1 / (1 + (M_planet / M_star)^0.5)). Or wait, maybe it's (R_star / a_planet) multiplied by some other factor. Alternatively, the probability is proportional to the ratio of the star's radius to the planet's orbital distance. But wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think.

The transit probability (the chance that a randomly oriented orbit would result in a transit) is given by R* / a, where R* is the radius of the star and a is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit. But wait, I'm not sure if that's exactly right. Or does it involve the planet's orbital period and the star's mass?

Wait, another angle: the transit probability depends on the orbital distance and the size of the star. The closer the planet is to the star (smaller a), the higher the probability because the star appears larger relative to the planet's orbit. But wait, wait: the probability is actually the ratio of the star's radius to the orbital distance (a), so P = (R*/a) * ... something else. Oh, but there's also an inclination factor. Oh, wait, in the case of circular orbits, the probability is (R*/a) multiplied by (1/(sqrt(1 - e^2))) but since both orbits are circular (e=0), that factor is 1. So P is just (R* / a).

Wait, but no, that's not entirely correct. Because even for a circular orbit, the probability that the inclination is just right for a transit is (R*/a) multiplied by something else? Or is it just (R*/a) multiplied by (1/(1 + (M_planet/M_star)^(1/3)) )? Hmm, maybe not. Let me think again.

Actually, I think the transit probability is the geometric probability, which is (R_*/a) * ( (1 + R_planet/R_*) ) but since R_planet is much smaller than R_*, it's approximately (R_*/a). But wait, wait, maybe it's (R_*/a) multiplied by (1/(sqrt(1 - e^2))) and for e=0, it's just R*/a. So the transit probability is proportional to R*/a.

But wait, in this problem, both stars have the same radius. So R1 = R2. So the question is which planet has a smaller a. Because transit probability is inversely proportional to a. So if a is smaller, the probability is higher.

But how do we find a? Because the orbital period is given, and we can relate a to the period using Kepler's third law. Kepler's law states that (a^3)/(T^2) = G(M_star + M_planet)/(4π²). But since M_planet is much smaller than M_star, we can approximate it as (a^3)/(T^2) = G M_star/(4π²). So a^3 = (G M_star T^2) / (4 π²). Therefore, a is proportional to (M_star * T²)^(1/3).

So for each planet, a is proportional to (M_star * T^2)^(1/3).

Given that, let's compute a for each planet.

Planet_1: M1 = 2*M2, T1 = T2 /3.

So a1 ∝ (2 M2 * (T2/3)^2 )^(1/3) = (2 M2 * T2² /9 )^(1/3) = ( (2/9) M2 T2² )^(1/3 )

Similarly, Planet_2: a2 ∝ (M2 * T2² )^(1/3 )

So a1 = [ (2/9) * M2 T2² ]^(1/3 ) = [ (2/9) ]^(1/3 ) * [ M2 T2² ]^(1/3 )

But a2 = [ M2 T2² ]^(1/3 )

So a1 = (2/9)^(1/3) * a2

Let me compute (2/9)^(1/3). 2 is 2, 9 is 3 squared. 2/9 is (2)/(3^2). So (2/9)^(1/3) is (2)^(1/3) / (3)^(2/3). Let me approximate that numerically. 2^1/3 is about 1.26, and 3^(2/3) is about 2.08. So 1.26 / 2.08 is approximately 0.605.

So a1 ≈ 0.605 * a2.

Wait, no, wait. Because a1 is (2/9)^(1/3) times a2. So a1 is smaller than a2. Because 0.605 is less than 1. So Planet_1 is closer to its star, so a1 is smaller. Which would imply a higher transit probability because P is proportional to R*/a.

But R* is the same for both stars, so P1 is (R*/a1) and P2 is (R*/a2). Since a1 is smaller than a2, P1 is larger than P2.

Wait, that would mean Planet_1 has a higher transit probability. So the researchers would prefer to observe Planet_1.

But wait, looking at the options, some options say Planet_2 is preferred, others Planet_1. So according to this, since a1 is smaller, P1 is larger. So Planet_1 has higher probability.

Wait, but let me double-check. Because the orbital period of Planet_1 is shorter, so it's closer, so a is smaller, so transit probability higher.

So then, which planet is observed? The one with higher probability. So planet_1 is better.

But wait, the options don't all have that. Let me check the options.

Options:

A) Planet_2 is preferred due to its ~2.25 times higher probability.

B) Planet_2 is preferred due to ~1.5 times higher.

C) Planet_1 is preferred due to ~1.65 times higher.

D) Planet_1 is preferred due to ~2.7 times higher.

So according to my previous calculation, Planet_1 has higher P, so options C or D.

Wait, but I need to compute the exact ratio of P1 to P2.

P is proportional to R*/a. Since R* is same, P1/P2 = a2/a1.

Because P1 = R*/a1, P2 = R*/a2. So P1/P2 = (a2)/(a1) = (a2) / (0.605 a2) ) = 1/0.605 ≈ 1.65.

So P1 is approximately 1.65 times higher than P2.

Therefore, Planet_1 has higher probability, and the ratio is about 1.65 times. So the correct option would be C: Planet_1 is preferred due to ~1.65 times higher probability.

So looking at the options, option C says that.

Yes, that makes sense. So the answer should be option C.


To determine which planet has a higher probability of transiting, we analyze the transit probability formula. The transit probability \( P \) is proportional to \( \frac{R_*}{a} \), where \( R_* \) is the radius of the host star, and \( a \) is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit. Since both stars have the same radius (\( R_* \)), the probability depends inversely on the semi-major axis \( a \). A smaller \( a \) results in a higher transit probability.

Using Kepler's third law, \( a^3 \propto M_* T^2 \), where \( M_* \) is the mass of the host star and \( T \) is the orbital period, we calculate the semi-major axes for both planets:

- For Planet_1: \( M_{*,1} = 2M_{*,2} \) and \( T_1 = \frac{T_2}{3} \). Thus,  
  \[
  a_1 \propto \left( M_{*,1} T_1^2 \right)^{1/3} = \left( 2M_{*,2} \left(\frac{T_2}{3}\right)^2 \right)^{1/3} = \left(\frac{2}{9} M_{*,2} T_2^2\right)^{1/3}.
  \]

- For Planet_2: \( a_2 \propto \left( M_{*,2} T_2^2 \right)^{1/3} \).

The ratio of the semi-major axes is:  
\[
\frac{a_1}{a_2} = \left(\frac{2}{9}\right)^{1/3} \approx 0.605.
\]

Since \( a_1 < a_2 \), Planet_1 is closer to its star and has a smaller semi-major axis, leading to a higher transit probability. The transit probability ratio is:  
\[
\frac{P_1}{P_2} = \frac{a_2}{a_1} = \frac{1}{0.605} \approx 1.65.
\]

Thus, Planet_1 has approximately 1.65 times the transit probability of Planet_2. The researchers would prefer to observe Planet_1.
