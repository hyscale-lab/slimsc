Okay, so I've got this NMR problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The problem involves a compound X, which has the formula C11H12O. It was reacted with 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane in a nonpolar solvent at 403 K for a day. Then, they looked at the 1H and 13C NMR spectra of the product. I need to figure out what Compound X is from the given options.

Hmm, wait a second. The reaction conditions are with 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane. I remember that this is a catalyst used in the epoxidation of alkenes, especially in the Prilezhaev oxidation or other epoxidation reactions. Oh right, it's a base that helps in the epoxidation of alkenes using peracids. But wait, the solvent is nonpolar, and the temperature is 403 K, which is pretty high. So maybe it's an epoxidation reaction where the double bond in Compound X is transformed into an epoxide.

So the product would have an epoxide group. But wait, the options are about the starting material, Compound X. So Compound X must have a double bond that was epoxidized. So the product would be an epoxide.

Looking at the options:

A) 2-(4-methylstyryl)oxirane
B) 2-(1-phenylprop-1-en-2-yl)oxirane
C) 2-methyl-3-styryloxirane
D) 2-styrylepoxide

Wait, some of these options are epoxides already. Because the product is an epoxide, but the options are for the starting compound. Hmm. So perhaps the starting compound is an alkene, and upon reaction, it becomes an epoxide.

Wait, let me think again. Oh wait, no. The problem says that the reaction is done on compound X, and the product is the one whose NMR is given. So if the reaction is epoxidation, then Compound X is the alkene, and the product is the epoxide.

So the product is the epoxide, and the NMR data is for the product.

So I should analyze the given NMR data to figure out the structure of the product, which will help me determine what the starting material was.

Let's look at the 1H NMR first.

The 1H NMR signals are:

δ 2.28 (3H, s): That's a singlet for 3H. Maybe a methyl group attached to something deshielded? Or perhaps a CH3 group attached to an oxygen, like a methylene adjacent to an epoxide. Or maybe it's a methyl group attached to an aromatic ring, but I'm not sure yet.

δ 2.31 (3H, s): Another singlet for 3H. Maybe another methyl group, possibly on a different part of the molecule.

Then, the aromatic region:

δ 6.75 (1H, d)
δ 7.08 (2H, d)
δ 7.68 (1H, d)
δ 7.
