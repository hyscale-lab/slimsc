Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about elastic scattering of electrons from a nuclear target. Hmm, elastic scattering—right, that's when the particles don't lose any kinetic energy, just change direction. The question gives me some phase shifts and tells me to find the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude along the incident beam direction.

Wait, the phase shifts are δ0, δ1, δ2, δ3, δ4, and so on. The given ones are 90°, 67°, 55°, 30°, and 13°. The rest are ignored. So I guess I only need to consider these five phase shifts.

The problem is asking for the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude along the incident beam direction. I remember that in scattering theory, the scattering amplitude f(θ) is given by a certain formula involving the phase shifts. 

Let me think. Oh right, the expression for the scattering amplitude is:

f(θ) = (1/k) * Σ [ (2l + 1) e^{i δ_l} sin(l δ_l) ]

But wait, no, wait. Or was it:

f(θ) = (1/(2ik)) Σ [ (2l + 1) [ e^{i δ_l} - 1 ] ]

Hmm, sometimes I get confused between the two. Wait, I think the correct formula is:

f(θ) = (1/k) * Σ [ (2l + 1) sin(δ_l) e^{i (δ_l + θ)} ) ] 

Wait, I'm not sure. Alternatively, I remember that the real and imaginary parts are related to the phase shifts. Oh wait, perhaps the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude along the incident direction (θ=0) is given by a specific part of this.

Wait, another approach: the scattering amplitude f(θ) in terms of partial waves is given by:

f(θ) = (1/k) Σ_{l=0}^∞ [ (2l + 1) sin(δ_l) e^{i(δ_l + lθ)} } ]

So, each term in the sum contributes to the amplitude. The imaginary part of f(θ) would then involve the sine and cosine of (δ_l + lθ).

Since the question asks specifically for the incident direction, θ=0°. So plugging θ=0 into the formula:

f(0) = (1/k) Σ [ (2l+1) sin(δ_l) e^{i δ_l}
