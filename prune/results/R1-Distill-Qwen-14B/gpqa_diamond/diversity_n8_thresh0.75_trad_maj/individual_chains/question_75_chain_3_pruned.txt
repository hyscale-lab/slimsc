Okay, so I have this question about molecular biology and genetics. Let me try to break it down. The scenario is about creating a transgenic mouse model to study the GADD45G protein's role in SARS-CoV-2 infection. They're trying to overexpress this protein, but it's not working. So, they made a construct that includes the coding sequence with an added hemagglutinin tag at the N-terminus. They transfected Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells with this plasmid using Lipofectamine and are selecting for antibiotic resistance, but the protein isn't being overexpressed. The question is about why.

The user provided the plus strand DNA sequence, so I need to look for possible issues in the coding sequence that would prevent proper expression. The options given are A to D.

Let me think through each possible issue. 

Option A: The sequence for the antigenic determinant has a missense mutation. Hmm. That would change the amino acid, but the question is about overexpression. If the HA tag isn't expressed, maybe the protein isn't being made. But would that prevent the protein from being expressed at all? Or could it lead to a truncated protein if the mutation caused a stop codon? If the HA sequence is inserted before the GADD45G, a mutation in the HA might not directly prevent GADD45G from being expressed. Unless the mutation introduced a stop codon, but I'm not sure if that's the case here.

Option B: The ribosome terminated translation early. How would that happen? If there's a stop codon upstream in the sequence, the ribosome would stop translating. So looking at the DNA sequence, I should check for any in-frame stop codons before the end. The sequence starts with ATG, which is the start codon. Let me scan through the codons. I'll translate a few to see. 

The first codon is ATG (start). Next is TAC, which is tyrosine. Then CCA (proline), then TAC (tyrosine again). Wait, the HA tag is at the N-terminus. So maybe the HA sequence is already part of the reading frame. Let me make sure the HA insertion is in frame. Oh wait, the question says the HA is introduced into the coding sequence, so it should be in frame with GADD45G. So if the HA tag's coding sequence has a frameshift or a stop codon, that would cause an issue.

Looking at the given DNA sequence: It starts with ATG (start), then TAC (Y), CCC (P), ATC (I), GAT (D), GTT (V), CCA (P), etc. So no stop codons (TAA, TAG, TGA) in the early part. If I look through the entire sequence, are there any in-frame stop codons? Let's see. For example, the codons after the start: TAC, CCC, ATC, GAT, GTT, CCA, GGA, GAA, GTC, etc. GAA is a codon for glutamic acid, so not a stop. Looking for TGA, TAG, TAA. Let me see: Looking down, I see ... CAG (Gln), ATT (I), ACC (Thr),
