Okay, so I have this physics problem here about calculating the energy of the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) when a certain nucleus is moving at 0.96 times the speed of light. The nucleus in question is Li with 3 neutrons. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.

First, I need to figure out what the nucleus is. Li is lithium. If it has 3 neutrons, then its atomic number is 3 (since Li has 3 protons normally), and the mass number would be 3 (protons) + 3 (neutrons) = 6. So it's Li-6, right? So the nucleus is a Li-6 ion.

Wait, but in the context of colliders, when they talk about heavy ions, they usually mean fully stripped nuclei, so they have a charge of +Ze, where Z is the atomic number. For Li-6, that would be Z=3, so charge +3e.

But for the purpose of calculating energy, maybe the charge isn't directly relevant here. The question is about the energy of the collider, which is related to the kinetic energy of the ions. Oh wait, no, wait. The energy in particle physics for ions is often given as the kinetic energy per ion, but sometimes it's the total energy. Wait, I need to clarify.

The problem says, 'the energy of the RHIC so that the speed of the nucleus X is equal to 0.96c'. So I think they're asking for the kinetic energy, but maybe it's the total energy. Hmm.

Wait, no, in particle accelerators, the energy given is usually the kinetic energy. Or wait, no, sometimes they give the total energy, which includes rest mass energy. So I need to be careful here.

The formula for the total energy of a relativistic particle is E = γmc², where γ is the Lorentz factor. The kinetic energy is E_k = (γ -1) mc².

The problem is asking for the energy of the RHIC, which probably refers to the kinetic energy each ion has. Or maybe the total energy? The options are in GeV, so perhaps it's the total energy? I'm a bit confused here.

Wait, the problem states: 'what is the energy of the RHIC so that the speed of the nucleus X is equal to 0.96c'. So I think they are asking for the kinetic energy, because the speed is given. So perhaps I should compute the kinetic energy.

Wait, no, wait. Let me think
