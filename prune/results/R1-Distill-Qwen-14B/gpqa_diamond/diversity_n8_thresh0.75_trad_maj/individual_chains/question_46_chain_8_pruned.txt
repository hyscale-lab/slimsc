Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to work through it step by step. Let me see if I can figure it out.

The question is about treating racemic 3-methylpent-1-ene with Grubbs catalyst. I remember that Grubbs catalyst is used in olefin metathesis reactions. Metathesis generally involves the redistribution of alkene fragments. Grubbs is a transition metal catalyst, usually based on ruthenium, and it's used for ring-closing metathesis or cross metathesis.

So, the starting material is racemic 3-methylpent-1-ene. Wait, racemic means it's a 50-50 mixture of enantiomers. But since the molecule is chiral, that's possible. Let me draw the structure of 3-methylpent-1-ene to visualize better.

Pent-1-ene means the double bond is between C1 and C2. So the structure is CH₂=CHCH(CH₂CH₃)CH₂CH₃? Wait, wait. Let me count the carbons. Pent means five carbons. So 3-methylpent-1-ene would be CH₂=CH-C(CH₂CH₃)-CH₂CH₃? No, wait, maybe I got the numbering wrong.

Wait, no. Pent-1-ene is CH₂=CHCH₂CH₂CH₂CH3? Wait no, wait, pentene has five carbons. So pent-1-ene is CH₂=CHCH₂CH₂CH3? No, wait that's hexene. Let me get this right. Pentene is CH₂=CHCH₂CH₂CH3? No, wait, that's actually 1-pentene. Wait, no, wait, 1-pentene is CH₂=CHCH₂CH₂CH3. So 3-methyl would be a branch on the third carbon.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think again. The structure of 3-methylpent-1-ene is CH₂=CH-CH(CH₂CH3)-CH2CH3? No, wait, the parent chain is five carbons, and the double bond is between C1 and C2. So the structure should be CH₂=CH-CH(CH₂CH3)-CH2CH3? Wait, that can't be right because that would make it a longer chain. Alternatively, maybe it's CH₂=CH-CH(CH₂CH3)-CH2CH3, but that would be six carbons,
