Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I need to figure out which planet has a higher probability of transiting. Let me read through the question again and break it down.

So, both Planet_1 and Planet_2 have been detected using the radial velocity (RV) method. That means we know their minimum masses and orbital periods. They have the same mass, which is interesting. But Planet_1's orbital period is three times shorter than Planet_2's. So, Planet_1 orbits its star much faster.

Both planets have circular orbits, so I don't have to worry about eccentricity affecting the transit probability. The host stars have the same radii, but different masses. The star hosting Planet_1 has twice the mass of Planet_2's star. Wait, but same radius? That's a bit tricky because I know that more massive stars are usually larger, but maybe in this case, Planet_2's host is a slightly evolved star, perhaps a subgiant or something, which might have expanded a bit, but in the question, they say both have the same radii, so same size.

The question is about which planet has a higher probability of transiting. I remember that the transit probability depends on the relative sizes of the planet and the star, as well as the orbital distance. The probability increases when the planet's orbital plane is edge-on relative to our line of sight, but only a fraction of orbits are aligned that way.

The formula I recall for the transit probability is approximately (R_p / R_s)^2 multiplied by (a / R_s), but wait, no, I think I might be mixing some factors here. Let me think again. Oh right, the geometric probability of a transit is roughly (R_p / R_s)² multiplied by (1 / (a/R_s)), but that doesn't seem right. Wait, no, wait. The transit probability is actually the ratio of the planet's orbital distance (in units of the star's radius) multiplied by the ratio of the planet's radius to the star's radius squared. Or wait, maybe it's (R_p / R_s)² multiplied by (R_s / a), because the chance depends on the chance that the planet's orbit passes in front of the star from our viewpoint. Or perhaps I should look at the formula correctly.

Wait, the actual formula for the transit probability is (R_p / R_s)^2 * ( (a / R_s) ) * ( (1 + (R_p / R_s)) )/(1 + sqrt( (a / R_s)^2 - (R_p/R
