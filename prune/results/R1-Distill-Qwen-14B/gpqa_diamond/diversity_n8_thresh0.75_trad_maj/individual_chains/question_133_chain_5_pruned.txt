Okay, so I need to find the concentration of orthophosphate ions in a solution that contains both KH2PO4 and Na2HPO4·2H2O. Hmm, I remember that these are phosphate salts, and they might form a buffer solution. Orthophosphate is PO4^3- right?

Wait, but wait. Let me think. H3PO4 is a triprotic acid, so it can donate three protons. The first dissociation is H3PO4 → H+ + H2PO4^-. The second is H2PO4^- → H+ + HPO4^2-, and the third is HPO4^2- → H+ + PO4^3-. 

The solution has KH2PO4 and Na2HPO4·2H2O. So, what do these salts do when dissolved? KH2PO4 is potassium hydrogen phosphate. When it dissolves, it dissociates into K+ and H2PO4^- ions. Similarly, Na2HPO4·2H2O should dissociate into 2 Na+ and HPO4^2- plus water. Wait, but since it's Na2HPO4·2H2O, the formula is Na2HPO4·2H2O, which upon dissolving would release 2 Na+ and HPO4^2- and water. Wait, but maybe the water doesn't contribute to the ions, so the main ions from each salt are H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- respectively.

So the solution contains both H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- ions. Oh, right! That means this is a buffer solution because a weak acid and its conjugate base are present. The H2PO4^- is the acid (since it can donate a proton to form HPO4^2-), and HPO4^2- is the conjugate base.

Wait, wait. Or is it the other way around? HPO4^2- is the conjugate base of H2PO4^-. Because H2PO4^- can lose a proton to become HPO4^2-, right. So in this case, the buffer system is H2PO4^- (acid) and HPO4^2- (base).
