Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the major product when 5-fluorocyclopenta-1,3-diene reacts with maleic anhydride. Hmm, I remember that maleic anhydride is often involved in Diels-Alder reactions. Right, Diels-Alder is a [4+2] cycloaddition between a diene and a dienophile.

Wait, 5-fluorocyclopenta-1,3-diene. Let me draw that structure. So cyclopentadiene is a five-membered ring with two double bonds. Oh wait, 1,3-diene means two double bonds separated by a single bond? Or maybe it's 1,3-diene in a five-membered ring? Wait no, cyclopenta-1,3-diene would have double bonds between 1-2 and 3-4, I think. So the structure is a five-membered ring with two double bonds, making it conjugated. So it's a conjugated diene in a ring.

Maleic anhydride is the dienophile. So the diene in this case would be the cyclopentadiene derivative. But wait, cyc
