Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let's see what it's about.

The question is about finding the concentration of calcium ions in a solution. The solution contains a stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex at a concentration of 0.02 M. The problem states that the pH is ideal, and the temperature is 25°C. The K for the Ca-EDTA complex is given as 5x10^10. Hmm, I think K here refers to the formation constant, which is the equilibrium constant for the formation of the complex ion.

So, I remember that the formation constant, Kf, relates the concentration of the complex ion to the concentrations of the individual ions. For a reaction like Ca²+ + EDTA^4- ↔ CaEDTA²−, the formation constant Kf is [CaEDTA²−]/([Ca²+][EDTA^4−]). 

Wait, but wait a second. The problem says it's a stoichiometric solution. Stoichiometric usually means that the molar amounts are in the exact ratio required by the balanced equation. So in this case, the solution is made by mixing Ca²+ and EDTA in a 1:1 molar ratio. That makes sense because the complex is 1 Ca and 1 EDTA.

So the initial concentrations would be 0.02 M for Ca²+ and 0.02 M for EDTA^4- before they react. But when they form the complex, the concentrations will change.

Let me denote the concentration of the complex as C. Since the reaction is 1:1, each mole of Ca²+ and EDTA^4- forms one mole of CaEDTA²−. So, if initially, both are 0.02 M, and let's say the amount that reacts is x, then:

[CaEDTA²−] = x
[Ca²+] = 0.02 - x
[EDTA^4−] = 0.02 - x 

But wait, wait. Wait, no. Because when the complex forms, the Ca and EDTA are consumed. So, actually, if the initial concentrations are both 0.02 M, and they form a complex, the amount of complex formed is x, so [Ca²+] becomes 0.02 - x, same for EDTA. But in reality, since K is very large (5e10), the reaction will go almost to completion. So x will be approximately 0.02, right? Because K is so big, the complex is favored heavily.

So, under these conditions, the concentrations of free Ca²+ and free EDTA^4− would be very low. So, in that case, [Ca²+] ≈ (0.02) / (something), but I need to set up the equation correctly.

Alternatively, perhaps I should think in terms of the formation constant expression. The Kf is 5e10. So,

Kf = [CaEDTA²−]/([Ca²+][EDTA^4−]) 

We can rearrange this as:

[Ca²+] = [CaEDTA²−]/(Kf * [EDTA^4−])

Wait, but perhaps it's better to let the concentrations of Ca²+ and EDTA^4− be equal because they react in a 1:1 ratio. Let me think. The stoichi
