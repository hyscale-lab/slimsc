Okay, so I've got this problem about stars and their elemental abundances. Hmm, let me try to understand what's being asked here. So, there are two stars, Star_1 and Star_2, each with different masses compared to the Sun. But wait, the question is about the ratio of silicon atoms in their photospheres. 

The given data includes their masses, but I'm not sure if mass directly affects the abundance ratio here. Oh, but I remember that mass might influence other factors like evolution, but since the problem mentions LTE (Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium) and the EW method, which are about measuring elemental abundances, maybe mass isn't directly needed for this calculation. I'll keep that in mind.

The elemental abundances given are [Si/Fe] for Star 1 and [Mg/Si] for Star 2. Also, [Fe/H] for Star 1 and [Mg/H] for Star 2. Wait, what do these brackets mean? Oh right, those are logarithmic abundance ratios. Like, [X/Y] = log10(n_X / n_Y) - log10(n_X / n_Y)_sun. So the values are relative to the Sun's abundances.

The Sun's photospheric composition is given: 12 + log10(nFe/nH) =7.5, which I can rearrange to find log10(nFe/nH) =7.5-12 = -4.5. Similarly for Mg: log10(nMg/nH) =7-12= -5.

Wait, let me write that down:

For the Sun:
log (nFe / nH) = 7.5 - 12 → 7.5-12 is -4.5. So nFe/nH = 10^(-4.5).
Similarly, nMg/nH = 10^(-5).

Now, for Star 1:

[Fe/H]_1 is 0. That means the abundance of Fe relative to H is the same as the Sun's. So nFe1/nH1 = nFe_sun / nH_sun. So [Fe/H]_1 = 0 implies that Fe abundance is solar. So no change in Fe compared to H.

Similarly, [Si/Fe]_1 is 0.3. So [Si/Fe]_1 = log10(nSi1/nFe1) - log10(nSi_sun / nFe_sun). So since [Si/Fe]_1 is 0.3, log(nSi1/nFe1) = 0.3 + log(nSi_sun / nFe_sun).

Wait, wait. No, the general formula is [X/Y]_star = log(n_X/n_Y)_star - log(n_X/n_Y)_sun.

So [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 → log(nSi1/nFe1) - log(nSi_sun/nFe_sun) = 0.3.

But I know nFe1/nH1 is the same as the Sun's because [Fe/H]_1 is 0, so nFe1 = (nFe_sun) * (nH1 / nH_sun). Hmm, wait, that might complicate things. Alternatively, perhaps let me express everything in terms of solar abundances.

Wait, maybe it
