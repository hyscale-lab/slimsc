Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here. Let's see what it's about. Hmm, racemic 3-methylpent-1-ene treated with Grubbs catalyst. I need to find the number of possible products, excluding ethene. The options are A to D.

Wait, first, I should remember what Grubbs catalyst does. Grubbs is a metathesis catalyst, right? It's used for olefin metathesis reactions. Metathesis involves breaking and reforming of double bonds, usually in a way that redistributes the substituents.

So, the starting material is racemic 3-methylpent-1-ene. Let's draw its structure. Pent-1-ene means the double bond is between C1 and C2. So, the structure is CH2=CHCH(CH2CH3)CH2CH3? Wait, wait. Let me think again. Pent has five carbons. 3-methylpent-1-ene would be: 

Carbon chain: CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3? Wait, no. Wait, pent-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH2CH3. But with a methyl branch on carbon 3. So, the structure is CH2=CH-C(CH3)H-CH2CH3? Wait, maybe I should count the carbons correctly.

Wait, the formula for 3-methylpent-1-ene. Pent means five carbons in the main chain. The double bond starts at carbon 1, so the structure is CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3? Wait, no, wait. 3-methylpent-1-ene would be:

1: CH2= 
2: CH- 
3: CH(CH3)- 
4: CH2- 
5: CH3.

Wait, that's right. So, the structure is CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3. But wait, that's six carbons. Oh wait, no. Wait, pent is five carbons. So, the main chain is five carbons. So, 3-methylpent-1-ene would have the double bond between C1 and C2, and a methyl group on C3.

So, the structure is: CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3? No, wait, the main chain is five carbons, so the substituent is on C3. So, maybe the structure is CH2=CH-CH(CH2CH3)-CH2? No, wait, I
