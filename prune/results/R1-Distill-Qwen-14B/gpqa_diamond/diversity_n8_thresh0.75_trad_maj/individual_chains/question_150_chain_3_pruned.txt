Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. Let me try to work through it step by step. I'm a bit new to this, so I'll take it slow and think out loud.

The question is about identifying a compound based on its NMR data and predicting the product after a series of reactions. Let me read the problem again carefully.

The molecular formula is C8H9NO. The NMR data is given with several signals. The reagents used are:

1. NaNO2 + HCl
2. H2O
3. Aqueous KOH and Heat.

The options are four different compounds, all seem to have some kind of aldehyde or ketone groups, and perhaps some aromatic rings.

First, I need to figure out what the starting compound is using the NMR data. Then, I'll think about each reaction step to see what transformations occur, leading to the final product.

Starting with the NMR data:

9.72 ppm (t, 1H) – That's a triplet integrating for 1H. A triplet around 9-10 ppm suggests an aldehyde proton, maybe. Because aldehydes are usually around 9-10 ppm. But wait, sometimes it's a ketone or other deshielded protons. But the triplet is interesting—so it's probably coupled to two other protons. Wait, but aldehyde protons are generally around 9-10, but they are usually singlets, right? Unless there's coupling. Hmm, maybe it's a conjugated aldehyde or part of an enol or something. Alternatively, maybe it's a vinylogous system.

Next, 6.98 ppm (d, 2H) – A doublet integrating for 2H. That's likely aromatic protons. A doublet suggests coupling with one neighboring proton. So maybe para-substituted aromatic rings. Wait, para-substituted would give two doublets. Or perhaps it's a di-substituted ring where each proton is next to one substituent.

6.51 ppm (d, 2H) – Another doublet, 2H. Maybe another set of aromatic protons. So perhaps we're looking at two pairs of doublets, each 2H. That suggests maybe a di-substituted benzene ring, like para-substituted, but split into two doublets. Wait, if a benzene has two substituents in para positions, each adjacent proton would have similar environments. Hmm, but in such a case, each pair would be a doublet. So, perhaps two para-substituted benzene rings? Or maybe one substituted benzene ring with substituents at certain positions.

Wait, another signal: 6.27 ppm (bs, 2H) – Broad singlet for 2H. That might suggest some sort of enol proton or an aromatic ring with substituents that cause these protons to be deshielded but without splitting. Or perhaps allylic protons, but more likely, something else. Broad suggests maybe exchange with something, like an -OH group or something acidic. So maybe these are protons near an oxygen, like ortho to a hydroxyl group.

Then, 3.66 ppm (d, 2H) – A doublet integrating for 2H. That's probably a CH2 group adjacent to something deshielding, like an oxygen. Maybe an OCH2 group? Or a CH2 connected to an electronegative atom. Wait, but the splitting is a doublet, which could mean two neighboring groups. So perhaps a CH2 adjacent to another CH2, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe it's part of a carbonyl group, like a ketone or aldehyde. Wait, but 3.66 is more in the range of CH2O, like an ether or an alcohol. But since it's a doublet, maybe it's next to another CH group.

Putting this together. Let's think about the structure.

The molecular formula is C8H9NO. Let's calculate the degree of unsaturation. Degree of unsaturation is (2C + 2 - H - X + N)/2. Here, C=8, H=9, N=1, O=1.

So it's (2*8 +2 -9 -0 +1)/2 = (18-9 +1)/2 = 10/2=5. So five degrees of unsaturation. That usually corresponds to rings and double bonds. So, perhaps two rings and a double bond, or one ring and three double bonds, but that's unlikely. Wait, let me recalculate:

Wait, wait, the formula is C8H9NO. So, C=8, H=9, N=1, O=1. So, the formula is C8H9NO.

Degrees of Unsaturation (DoU) = (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. Assuming X is 0. So:

DoU = (2*8 +2 -9 -0 +1)/2 = (18 -9 +1)/2 = (10)/2=5.

Five degrees. That could be, for example, one ring (from benzene, which is 3 DoU) plus a double bond and maybe another ring or another double bond.

Wait, benzene is 3 DoU. So if there's a benzene ring, that accounts for 3. Then perhaps a double bond (1) and another ring or another double bond.

Looking at the NMR, the 9.72 ppm could be an aldehyde. But is it possible that the starting compound is an aromatic aldehyde with substituents?

Alternatively, maybe a ketone, but I thought aldehyde protons are around 9-10. Let's see.

Let me try to sketch a possible structure. The NMR has 6.98 and 6.51 ppm as two doublets each integrating 2H. Maybe that's a para-substituted benzene ring. So, if we have a substituent in the para position, the adjacent protons would be each in a doublet. So perhaps the 6.98 and 6.51 are from a di-substituted benzene ring, perhaps with substituents in para positions. Wait, but two substituents would split the ring into two doublets. Alternatively, maybe it's a single substituent with two doublets, but that's not quite right.

Wait, another possibility is
