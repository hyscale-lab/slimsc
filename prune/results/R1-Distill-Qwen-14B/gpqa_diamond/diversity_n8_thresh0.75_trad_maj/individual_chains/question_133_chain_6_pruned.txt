Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because it's about buffer solutions and phosphate ions. Hmm. Let me try to break it down step by step.

The problem states that there's a solution with a volume of 200.00 cm³, which I think is 200 mL. It contains 1.00 g of KH2PO4 and 1.00 g of Na2HPO4·2H2O. The molecular weights are given as 136.09 g/mol and 177.99 g/mol respectively. The temperature is 25°C, and we're asked about the concentration of orthophosphate ions (HPO4^2-?), but wait, orthophosphate is actually H3PO4, right? Or wait, no. Maybe I should clarify.

Wait, no. Orthophosphate is the fully protonated form, H3PO4. Then the dihydrogen phosphate is H2PO4^-, and hydrogen phosphate is HPO4^2-. But wait, the question is about the concentration of orthophosphate ions, which I think is HPO4^2-? Or wait, maybe I'm getting this mixed up. Wait, no, orthophosphate is the H3PO4 molecule. Oh wait, no, I think orthophosphate refers to the HPO4^2- ion. Or wait, I'm getting confused. Let me think. The problem says orthophosphate ions. Hmm, wait, the phosphate ion is PO4^3-, but the different protonated forms are the ones mentioned. So, in this context, orthophosphate ion is HPO4^2-? Or is it H3PO4? I'm a bit confused, but perhaps the question is referring to HPO4^2-.

Wait, but looking at the substances given: KH2PO4 is potassium dihydrogen phosphate, which dissociates into K+ and H2PO4^- ions. Na2HPO4·2H2O is sodium hydrogen phosphate, which dissociates into 2 Na+ and HPO4^2- ions. So in solution, we have H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-.

Wait, but the problem is
