Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem in front of me, and I need to figure out the correct sequence of reactions to synthesize 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene starting from benzene. Hmm, that's a mouthful. Let's break it down.

First, I should probably sketch the target molecule to visualize what's going on. So, the target is a benzene ring with three substituents: a tert-butyl group, an ethoxy group, and a nitro group. The positions are numbered 1, 2, and 3. Wait, wait. The numbering is important here. Let me see: 1-ethoxy, 2-tert-butyl, 3-nitro. So, substituents at positions 1, 2, and 3 of benzene.

But wait, benzene is symmetric, so it doesn't matter which position I start with, but the order of adding substituents will matter because of the directing effects of each group.

So, the substituents are: ethoxy (OCH2CH3), tert-butyl (C(CH3)3), and nitro (NO2). I need to figure out the order in which to add these groups to benzene to get the desired product.

I remember that substituents on aromatic rings can direct incoming electrophiles to certain positions. Nitro groups are meta directors, ethoxy is an activating group and is ortho/para directing, while tert-butyl is a bulky group but it's a strong activating group, also ortho/para directing because it's an alkyl group, which is activating through the inductive effect.

Wait, wait. No, wait. Alkyl groups are activating, yes, because of the +I effect, making the ring more reactive. But nitro groups are deactivating because they're meta directors.

So, the order of adding substituents will affect where the next group attaches. So, I need to plan the order so that each new substituent goes into the correct position relative to the existing groups.

Let me think about the target structure again. It's 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene. So, numbering the ring, position 1 is ethoxy, position 2 is tert-butyl, position 3 is nitro.

Wait, that arrangement. So, the substituents are adjacent to each other. Let me think about the order
