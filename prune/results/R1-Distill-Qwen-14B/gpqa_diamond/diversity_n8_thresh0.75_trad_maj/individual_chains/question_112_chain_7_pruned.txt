Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The problem says that we have a state |alpha> which is proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2 - i)|down>. The |up> and |down> are the eigenstates of the z-projection of the spin operator. So, first, I think I need to normalize this state because the question says it's proportional, not necessarily normalized.

Wait, the first part asks for the probability of measuring the particle in each of the eigenstates of another operator A. The operator A is defined by elements Aij where Aij = ħ/2 if i≠j and 0 otherwise. Hmm, so what does that matrix look like? Let me think. Since the basis is |up> and |down>, which are two-dimensional, the matrix will be 2x2. So, A is a 2x2 matrix where the diagonal elements are zero, and the off-diagonal elements are ħ/2. So, it looks like:

A = [[0, ħ/2],
     [ħ/2, 0]]

Wait, but the eigenstates for operator A are probably different from the |up> and |down> states. So, the eigenstates of A would be a new basis. So, to find the probabilities, I need to express |alpha> in terms of these new eigenstates and find the probabilities of each.

But before that, I should normalize |alpha>, right? Because the coefficients are (1+i) and (2-i), which probably don't sum to a norm of 1.

So, let's compute the norm squared of |alpha>. The state is proportional, so the state is |alpha> = (1+i)|up> + (2 -i)|down>. The norm squared is |1+i|^2 + |2 -i|^2. Because |a|^2 = a*a, where * is the complex conjugate.

Calculating |1+i|^2: (1)*(1) + (1)*(-1) [Wait, no, that's not right. Wait, |a + b i|^2 = a² + b². So, (1)^2 + (1)^2 = 2. Similarly, |2 -i|^2 is (2
