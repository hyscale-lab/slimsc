Okay, so I have this physics problem here about the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) and the energy required for a nucleus to reach a certain speed. Hmm, let me try to break this down.

The question is asking for the energy of RHIC so that the speed of nucleus X is 0.96c. Nucleus X is Li with 3 neutrons. Let me think, Li is lithium. The standard lithium has 3 protons, right? So if it has 3 neutrons, the isotope must be Li-6 because 3 protons + 3 neutrons equals 6 nucleons. So the nucleus is Li-6, which has a mass number A=6.

Wait, but when it comes to relativistic particles, we're dealing with relativistic energy, so I remember that the total energy of a particle is given by gamma times the rest mass energy. Gamma is the Lorentz factor, which depends on the velocity.

The formula for gamma is 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²). Since the speed v is 0.96c, let me plug that in. Let me compute beta first, which is v/c. Beta is 0.96, so beta squared is 0.96^2 = 0.9216. Then 1 - beta squared is 1 - 0.9216 = 0.0784. The square root of that is sqrt(0.0784) = 0.28. So gamma is 1 / 0.28 ≈ 3.5714. Hmm, let me double-check that calculation. Because 0.28 times 3.5714 is approximately 1, right? 0.28 * 3.5714 ≈ 1, yes.

So gamma is approximately 3.5714. Now, the total energy E is gamma * m_rest * c². But wait, I need the rest mass of the Li-6 nucleus. The mass of a single nucleon (proton or neutron) is approximately 938 MeV/c². But wait, the exact value for a proton is about 938.272 MeV/c², and neutron is about 939.565 MeV/c². But for heavy nuclei, the mass is the sum of the individual nucleons minus the binding energy, but since we're dealing with the total mass of the nucleus, perhaps it's just
