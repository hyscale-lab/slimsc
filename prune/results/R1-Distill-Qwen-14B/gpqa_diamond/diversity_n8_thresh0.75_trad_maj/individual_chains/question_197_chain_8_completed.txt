Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. So, the question is about identifying a compound based on its IR and NMR data and then determining the product when it reacts with red phosphorus and HI. Hmm, I remember that red phosphorus and HI are typically used for the hydrolysis of an acid chloride to a carboxylic acid, or maybe an ester? Wait, no, wait. Let me think. Oh right, when an acid chloride reacts with HI, it might do something else, but red phosphorus is often used to convert acid chlorides to acids. Because I think that's a substitution reaction where the chloride leaves, and water or something else comes in. Wait, but actually, when you have an acid chloride, say RCOCl, and you treat it with red phosphorus and HI, it converts it to a carboxylic acid. Oh right, because red phosphorus acts as a reducing agent here, helping to convert the acid chloride to the acid. So the product would be RCOOH.

Now, looking at the options, the possible products are all either acids or substituted benzene rings. Let's check the options:

Option A: 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid. So that's a phenyl group attached to the second carbon of a propanoic acid. Structure would be Ph-CH2-COOH maybe? Wait, no, wait. Propanoic acid is CH2CH2COOH, so 2-(4-ethylphenyl) would be the phenyl attached to the second carbon. Alternatively, maybe it's Ph-CH2-CH2-COOH? I'm a bit confused about the numbering here.

Option C: 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. So benzoic acid with a sec-butyl group at the para position. So the benzene ring has a -COOH group and a -CH(CH2CH3)2 group? Wait, no, sec-butyl is CH2CH(CH2CH3), but that's not right. Wait, let's think. The sec-butyl group is -CH2CH(CH2CH3), but actually, wait, butyl is four carbons. So the structure would be -CH2CH2CH2CH3? No, wait, no. Wait, the sec-butyl is a three-carbon branch. Let me get this right. Butyl groups: the straight chain is four carbons. The sec-butyl group is -CH2CH(CH2CH3) ?, no. Wait, no. Wait, butyl groups can be primary, secondary, tertiary. So the structure of sec-butyl is CH2CH(CH2CH3), but that's four carbons in total. Wait, that can't be right because that would be a four-carbon group attached to the benzene. Let me think again. The butyl group is a four-carbon group. So for a sec-butyl, the branching is on the second carbon. So structure is CH2CH(CH2CH3) attached to the benzene? But wait, that would make it a five-carbon group? Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused here. Alternatively, perhaps the structure is (CH2)2CHCH2- but that's more like a primary butyl. Wait, perhaps the correct structure is -CH2CH(CH2CH2CH3), but I'm not sure. Maybe I should think in terms of the substituents on the benzene ring.

So, the starting compound, X, reacts under those conditions to give one of these products. So first, we need to figure out what X is based on the spectroscopic data.

Looking at the IR data: The peaks are at 3400-2500 cm-¹, which usually indicates either an O-H or an N-H stretch. But the other peaks are 1720 cm-¹, which is a strong carbonyl (C=O) stretch. 1610 and 1450 cm-¹ are around the regions for aromatic C=C stretches. So the IR suggests the presence of a carbonyl group (like a ketone, ester, or acid chloride), and an aromatic ring. Also, the broad peak around 3400-2500 could be from an O-H (like an acid) or maybe an alcohol. Hmm, but if X is an acid chloride, its IR would show a strong peak around 1800 cm-¹, but here it's 1720, which is more like an ester or possibly a ketone. Alternatively, maybe it's a carboxylic acid, but then the O-H would be broad around 3000-2500. Wait, but in the IR, they have a peak from 3400–2500, which is a broad region, possibly indicating an O-H stretch (like a carboxylic acid?), but then the 1720 suggests an ester or ketone.

Wait, but in the NMR data, there's a peak at 10.5 ppm (bs, 1H). That's a very high chemical shift, which is typical for an aldehyde proton or a carboxylic acid proton. Since aldehyde protons are usually around 9-10 ppm, but a carboxylic acid proton is typically a broad peak around 10-12 ppm. So 10.5 ppm as a broad singlet suggests a carboxylic acid. But wait, if X is a carboxylic acid, then reacting with red phosphorus and HI wouldn't change it, because carboxylic acids are pretty stable. But wait, red phosphorus and HI: I think that when an acid chloride is treated with red phosphorus, it's converted to the acid, because the PCl5 (or similar) is formed, which is a stronger leaving group. So if X is an acid chloride, then the product would be the carboxylic acid.

Alternatively, maybe X is an ester. Esters have carbonyl peaks around 1720 cm-¹, similar to acid chlorides. But esters would have O-H if it's an alcohol, but the IR here doesn't show any strong peak that would suggest an ester's C-O-C stretch. Wait, the IR might not show that because it's a weak peak.

Looking at the NMR data: Let's list out the peaks.

10.5 ppm (bs, 1H): Probably a carboxylic acid proton.

8.0 ppm (d, 2H): This is aromatic protons, likely a para-substituted ring, like two protons as a doublet, which would be the case if there's a substituent on the benzene that creates a para-dichlorobenzene-like splitting. So the ring is probably para-substituted with two substituents.

Wait, but the substituents on the benzene would influence the NMR. Let me think. If the ring has two substituents, like a substituent at the para position, that would lead to the aromatic protons being in a particular pattern. Alternatively, if it's a mono-substituted benzene with two equivalent protons ortho and para, but that's not the case here because the integration is 2H each.

Wait, the NMR shows 8.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.2 ppm (d, 2H). So this suggests that the aromatic ring has two sets of protons, each as a doublet. So perhaps the ring is a para-substituted benzene, where each substituent is causing the protons to split into doublets. For example, if the ring has two substituents, each at the para positions relative to each other. Wait, but if it's a single substituent, like a meta substituent, you wouldn't get two doublets. Or perhaps it's a di-substituted benzene in the para position. For example, a substituent at the para position, making the ring have two sets of protons, each as a doublet. But wait, a para-disubstituted benzene would have each substituent across from each other, so the protons would be in two sets of two equivalent protons each. So the NMR would show two doublets, each integrating to 2H, which matches the given data.

So the benzene ring is para-substituted with two groups. Wait, but in the NMR, if the substituents are in the para positions, the adjacent (ortho) protons would be equivalent, and the meta protons would be equivalent. But in this case, the substituent is only one group, perhaps with two groups attached, but that's getting a bit confusing.

Wait, but looking at the substituents, perhaps one substituent is a group with a carbonyl, like a ketone or an ester, and the other substituent is an alkyl group. Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a group like -COOR (ester), which would cause the adjacent protons to be split into certain patterns.

Wait, but in the NMR, the 10.5 ppm peak is from a carboxylic acid. So perhaps the substituent is a -COOH group. Let's see, but in that case, the IR would have a very strong peak around 1700 cm-¹, which it does (1720). Wait, but a carboxylic acid's carbonyl is around 1700. Oh, but wait, if X is a carboxylic acid, then reacting with red phosphorus and HI would do what? I thought that if X is an acid chloride, it would become a carboxylic acid. But if X is already a carboxylic acid, then perhaps the reaction doesn't change it. Hmm, but the question is about what X is. So let's try to figure out what X is before worrying about the reaction.

Let me look at the NMR more carefully.

The 10.5 ppm peak is a broad singlet, which is likely a carboxylic acid. So X has a -COOH group.

The aromatic region: 8.0 ppm (d, 2H), 7.2 ppm (d, 2H). So for a para-substituted benzene ring, if there's a strong electron-withdrawing group like -COOH, the ring protons would deshield, causing higher ppm shifts. Wait, but in this case, the higher ppm is at 8.0, and the lower is at 7.2, which is a bit confusing. Alternatively, it might be that the substituent is an electron-donating group, which would cause lower ppm shifts. Hmm.

Wait, another approach: the substituent on the benzene is a -COOR (ester) group. Then, the adjacent protons would be deshielded, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a -COOH group, which is electron-withdrawing, causing the ring protons to be downfield shifted.

Wait, but in the NMR, the two doublets suggest that the substituent is in the para position, and the ring has two sets of equivalent protons. Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is in the ortho position relative to another substituent, but that's getting complicated.

Wait, perhaps the structure is a benzoic acid derivative. For example, 4-ethylbenzoic acid? Or something similar.

Looking at the other NMR signals:

2.9 ppm (m, 1H): This is likely a CH group adjacent to some substituents, maybe near an electronegative atom like oxygen. Or perhaps it's a CH group in a branched chain.

1.7 ppm (m, 2H): This could be part of a CH2 group next to a branching point or near another group.

1.4 ppm (d, 3H): A triplet of three hydrogens, perhaps as a methyl group attached to a CH2 or a quaternary carbon.

0.9 ppm (t, 3H): A terminal methyl group, likely as part of an ethyl or longer chain.

Wait, trying to piece this together. Let me think about the structure of X.

If the aromatic ring has a -COOH group at the para position and another substituent, perhaps an ethyl group or a more complex alkyl chain.

Wait, the 0.9 ppm triplet (3H) suggests a methyl group attached to a chain, perhaps a terminal methyl group (like in an ethyl chain). The 1.4 ppm d (3H) suggests a methyl group attached to a CH2 group, maybe as a geminal group. The 1.7 ppm m (2H) could be a CH2 adjacent to branching.

Putting this together, perhaps the substituent on the benzene is an isobutyl group or a sec-butyl group. Let's imagine that.

An isobutyl group would have the structure CH2CH(CH2CH3)2. Wait, no, isobutyl is -CH2CH(CH2CH3) ?

Wait, no. Let me get it right. The isobutyl group is -CH2CH(CH3)2? No, wait. The isobutyl group is actually -(CH2)CH(CH2CH3), but I'm getting confused. Let me think in terms of structure.

Wait, the substituent could be a sec-butyl group. The structure of sec-butyl is CH2CH(CH2CH3)– attached to the ring. So the substituent would be -(CH2)CH(CH2CH3). So the substituent is a four-carbon chain with a branch on the second carbon.

Wait, but looking at the NMR signals:

- 1H at 2.9 ppm (m, 1H): This could be the CH that's in the middle of the substituent. For example, in a sec-butyl group, the central CH would be at around 2.9 ppm.

- 1.7 ppm (m, 2H): These could be the two CH2 groups adjacent to the central CH.

- 1.4 ppm (d, 3H): This is a methyl group attached to the central CH. So the structure would be CH(CH2CH3)(CH2CH2CH3), but that's getting complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is an ethyl group attached to a CH2 group, but I'm not sure.

Wait, let me think about the substituent. The H NMR shows this: a triplet at 0.9 (3H), a doublet at 1.4 (3H), and a multiplet at 1.7 (2H) and 2.9 (1H). So perhaps this is a butyl group, either straight chain or branched.

Wait, the triplet at 0.9 ppm (3H) is likely the end of a chain, so perhaps a CH2CH2CH2CH3 group. But the 1.4 ppm doublet is a methyl group attached to a CH2. Hmm.

Wait, if it's a sec-butyl group, the structure is CH2CH(CH2CH3)–. So the groups would be:

- The central CH has three substituents: two CH2 groups and a methyl group.

Wait, no, the structure of a sec-butyl group is CH2CH(CH2CH3)–. So the substituents on the central CH would be:

- One CH2 group attached to the ring,

- One CH2CH3 group,

- And another CH2 group leading to the terminal CH2CH3?

Wait, perhaps the structure is: benzene ring with a -CH2-CH(CH2CH3)- group attached.

Wait, but in that case, the NMR would show the following:

- The terminal CH3 would be a triplet at 0.9 ppm.

- The CH2CH2 would be a quartet, but perhaps in the multiplet at 1.7 ppm.

But this is getting a bit complicated. Alternatively, the substituent could be an isobutyl group, which is a branched four-carbon group.

Wait, let me think about the substituent as a -CH2-CH(CH2CH3)– group attached to the benzene. So, the substituent would be a butyl group with the branching on the second carbon.

In that case, the NMR would show:

- The terminal CH3 (0.9 ppm, triplet).

- The CH2 adjacent to the branch would be a quartet, but in the NMR it's a multiplet at 1.7 ppm (2H). 

- The central CH would have neighboring groups, perhaps at 2.9 ppm (1H).

- The methyl group attached to the central CH would show up as a doublet at 1.4 ppm (3H).

So putting this together, the substituent is a sec-butyl group attached to the benzene ring. So the structure would be benzene with a -COOH group and a -CH2-CH(CH2CH3) group in the para position.

Wait, but wait, if the substituent is a sec-butyl group and a carboxylic acid group in the para position, then the structure would be 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. Let me check the options.

Option C is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. So that's a possibility.

But wait, what about the IR? The IR has a peak at 1720 cm-¹, which would correspond to a carbonyl. Carboxylic acids have carbonyls around 1700 cm-¹, but if there's an ester or another carbonyl group, it would be higher. Wait, but if X is a benzoic acid derivative, its carbonyl would be around 1700, which matches the 1720 in the IR. So that fits.

But wait, what about the other IR peaks at 1610 and 1450 cm-¹? Those are in the range of aromatic C=C stretching. So that fits with the benzene ring.

So the NMR data:

- 10.5 ppm: -COOH proton.

- 8.0 and 7.2 ppm: aromatic protons, para-substituted.

- The substituent's NMR signals: 2.9 (CH), 1.7 (CH2), 1.4 (CH3), 0.9 (CH2CH3).

So X is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. Then, when X reacts with red phosphorus and HI, what happens?

Wait, earlier I thought that red phosphorus and HI are used to convert acid chlorides to carboxylic acids. But wait, if X is already a carboxylic acid, what would happen? That doesn’t make sense because a carboxylic acid wouldn't react with red phosphorus and HI in that way. So perhaps X is not a carboxylic acid but an acid chloride. Because acid chlorides, when treated with red phosphorus and HI, would convert to carboxylic acids.

Wait, wait, but the NMR data suggests a carboxylic acid, which would have a broad peak around 10-12 ppm. So if X is a carboxylic acid, then reacting it with red phosphorus and HI wouldn't change it. But the question says X reacts with red phosphorus and HI, so maybe X is an acid chloride, and the product is a carboxylic acid.

Wait, but then the NMR data would not show a peak at 10.5 ppm because acid chlorides don’t have a -COOH group. So I'm a bit confused now.

Alternative approach: Let's think about the NMR and IR together. The IR has a peak at 1720 cm-¹, which suggests an ester or a ketone or maybe an acid chloride. The 10.5 ppm peak in NMR is very high, which could be an aldehyde proton. Wait, but aldehydes have a peak around 9-10 ppm. So if X is an aldehyde, then the IR wouldn't have a 1720 peak. Hmm.

Wait, another possibility: the 10.5 ppm peak is an aldehyde proton, and the 1720 is a ketone. So X is an aromatic aldehyde with a ketone group. But that seems less likely.

Alternatively, perhaps the 10.5 ppm is an aldehyde, and the 1720 is an ester or acid. But that doesn't fit the data because the NMR would have more protons if it's an aldehyde.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a benzaldehyde derivative, but the IR doesn’t clearly support that.

I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let's try another approach.

Looking at the options, the possible products are either benzoic acids or substituted benzenes.

If the reaction converts an acid chloride to a carboxylic acid, then X must be an acid chloride. But in that case, the NMR would not have a peak at 10.5 ppm because acid chlorides don't have -OH protons. So that can't be.

Wait, but if X is an ester, then reacting with HI under certain conditions might hydrolyze it to a carboxylic acid. But red phosphorus is usually used in the conversion of acid chlorides to acids.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a methyl ester of a benzoic acid. Then, reacting with HI and red phosphorus would not change it, because esters are not typically converted under those conditions unless it's a specific type of reaction. Hmm, I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the IR and NMR data are not pointing to a carboxylic acid. Let me re-examine.

The IR has a peak at 1720, which could be an ester (C=O). The 3400-2500 cm-¹ is a broad region, which could be an O-H (like in an alcohol) or an N-H. But if it's an ester, the O-H would be from an alcohol, but then why is there no peak at 1720 for the ester's C=O? Wait, esters do have C=O around 1720, yes. So maybe X is an ester.

So if X is an ester, like RCOOR', then the IR would show the C=O at ~1720. The NMR would have a peak for the carbonyl O, but perhaps not. The 10.5 ppm peak could be something else. Wait, but 10.5 ppm is very high, which suggests either an aldehyde or a carboxylic acid.

Wait, maybe X is not a carboxylic acid but a benzaldehyde with a substituent. Let's say the structure is Ph-CHO. Then, the aldehyde proton would be around 10 ppm. But then the IR would not have a 1720 peak because there's no carbonyl except for the aldehyde, which is around 1700. Oh wait, the aldehyde's C=O is around 1720 cm-¹, so that fits. So the IR would have a peak at 1720, which would be the aldehyde.

Then, the NMR would have a peak at around 10 ppm (the aldehyde proton), which fits the 10.5 ppm. Then, looking at the aromatic protons, if the aldehyde is at the para position to another substituent, the aromatic protons would be split into two doublets.

But then, what about the other signals? The 2.9 ppm (m, 1H), 1.7 (m, 2H), 1.4 (d,3H), and 0.9 (t,3H). That suggests a longer chain substituent, perhaps an ethyl group or a butyl group.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is an isopropyl group or a butyl group attached to the benzene ring. Let's imagine the substituent is a propyl group or butyl group in the para position relative to the aldehyde.

But then, if X is benzaldehyde with an ethyl group in the para position, the substituent would be -CH2CH2CH3, but that doesn't explain the NMR signals we have.

Wait, I'm getting stuck here. Let me think again about the possible structures.

Looking at the options, option C is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. If X is the acid chloride of that, then after reaction, it would become benzoic acid. But how does that fit the data?

Wait, but in the NMR, the 10.5 ppm would be from the -COOH group, which would fit if X is a benzoic acid. But then, reacting it with red phosphorus and HI wouldn't change it, so the product would be the same as X. But the question states that X reacts, implying a change. So perhaps X isn't a benzoic acid.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a substituted cinnamic acid or something else. Hmm.

Another angle: The IR has a peak at 1610 and 1450 cm-¹, which are indicative of aromatic C=C stretching. So the compound has a benzene ring. The IR also has a peak at 1720, which is a strong carbonyl.

So X has a benzene ring and a carbonyl group. The NMR shows a peak at 10.5 ppm, which is a high shift, possibly indicating a carboxylic acid or an aldehyde.

If the 10.5 ppm is an aldehyde, then the IR peak at 1720 would correspond to the aldehyde's C=O. Then, the NMR would have the aldehyde proton as a triplet or something else, but in this case, it's a broad singlet, which is more typical for a carboxylic acid.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a ketone. Then the IR would have a peak around 1720, but the NMR would not have a peak at 10.5 ppm unless it's an aldehyde.

Wait, the 10.5 ppm could also be an exchangeable proton, like in a phenol. But phenols have O-H around 5-7 ppm, so that's unlikely.

Alternatively, perhaps the 10.5 ppm is an acidic proton, like in a carboxylic acid. So, putting it all together, X is a para-substituted benzoic acid with a substituent that includes a butyl group.

So, how does the substituent look in the NMR?

The substituent's NMR signals:

- 2.9 ppm (m, 1H): likely a CH group.

- 1.7 ppm (m, 2H): two CH2 groups.

- 1.4 ppm (d, 3H): a methyl group attached to a CH2.

- 0.9 ppm (t,3H): a terminal methyl group.

This seems to fit a butyl group. Let's think about a sec-butyl group. The structure would be CH2CH(CH2CH3). So the substituent is -CH2CH(CH2CH3) attached to the benzene ring.

Wait, no, the substituent would be a sec-butyl group, which is -(CH2)CH(CH2CH3). So the structure is benzene ring with a -COOH group at position 4 and a -CH2CH(CH2CH3) group at position 1.

So the substituent is a sec-butyl group at the para position relative to the -COOH.

So X is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. Then, when X reacts with red phosphorus and HI, what happens?

Wait, but if X is already a carboxylic acid, why would it react with red phosphorus and HI? Unless X is an acid chloride, which then converts to a carboxylic acid. But in that case, X wouldn't have a -COOH group.

Ah! Maybe X is an acid chloride, RCOCl. Its IR would have a strong C=O around 1800, but in the data, it's 1720, which is more like an ester. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is not converting an acid chloride to a carboxylic acid. Maybe it's a different reaction. Wait, red phosphorus and HI can also be used in the hydrolysis of esters to carboxylic acids. So if X is an ester, RCOOR', then reaction with red phosphorus and HI would convert it to RCOOH.

So if X is an ester, then the product would be the corresponding carboxylic acid.

So, to find out what X is, let's see if the NMR data fits an ester.

An ester has the structure RCOOR', so the carbonyl would be around 1720 in IR, which matches.

The NMR would have:

- The aromatic protons as two doublets, which matches.

- The ester oxygen, but the NMR wouldn't show that directly.

- The substituent R' would be an alkyl group, which in this case, from the NMR, seems to be a butyl group.

Wait, but in the NMR, there's a peak at 10.5 ppm, which wouldn't fit an ester. Esters don't have a proton at 10.5 ppm unless it's an aliphatic aldehyde, which doesn't make sense here. So this complicates things.

Alternatively, perhaps X is an alpha-hydroxy ester, but that might complicate the NMR further.

Hmm, I'm getting stuck. Let's try to think about the options again.

The options are:

A) 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid

B) 1-isobutyl-4-methylbenzene

C) 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid

D) 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene

The reaction is with red phosphorus and HI, which likely converts an acid chloride to a carboxylic acid. So the product is a carboxylic acid.

Looking at the options, options A and C are carboxylic acids, while B and D are substituted benzenes (aromatic compounds without acid groups).

If X is an acid chloride, then after reaction, the product would be the acid. So if the product is either A or C.

Looking at the data, X's NMR has a 10.5 ppm peak, which suggests a carboxylic acid, but if X is an acid chloride, it wouldn't have that. So perhaps X is an acid, and the reaction doesn't change it. But that doesn't make sense because the question says X reacts.

Wait, maybe X is an ester, and the reaction converts it to a carboxylic acid.

So, if X is an ester, for example, RCOOR', then after reaction with red phosphorus and HI, it becomes RCOOH.

So, looking at the options, if option C is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid, then X would be the corresponding ester, like 4-(sec-butyl)benzoate ester.

But then, the NMR of X (the ester) would not show a peak at 10.5 ppm because esters don't have a -COOH group. So that doesn't fit.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a different compound that, when treated with red phosphorus and HI, forms one of the options.

Wait, another possibility: the reaction isn't about acid chlorides or esters. Maybe it's an elimination or some other reaction. Wait, but red phosphorus and HI are typically for acid chloride to acid conversion.

Hmm. I think I'm going in circles here. Let's try to think about the reaction.

Red phosphorus and HI is used to prepare a carboxylic acid from an acid chloride. So, if X is an acid chloride, the product is the corresponding carboxylic acid.

Looking back at the options, the possible products are A and C, which are carboxylic acids.

So, the question is, which one is the product.

Now, the problem is to determine what X is, so that when it reacts, it gives the product.

But how?

We need to figure out what X is based on the NMR and IR.

The IR of X has a peak at 1720 cm-¹, which could be an ester, acid chloride, or possibly a ketone.

The NMR of X has a peak at 10.5 ppm, which suggests a carboxylic acid. So if X is a carboxylic acid, then reacting it with red phosphorus and HI wouldn't change it because it's already the acid.

Alternatively, perhaps X is an acid chloride. But then, the NMR would not have a peak at 10.5 ppm, because acid chlorides don't have -OH or -COOH protons.

Hmm, perhaps the initial assumption is wrong, and X is not a carboxylic acid. Let me think again.

The IR of X:

- 3400–2500 cm-¹: broad, perhaps O-H (like an alcohol) or N-H.

- 1720 cm-¹: strong carbonyl (ester, acid chloride, ketone).

- 1610 and 1450 cm-¹: aromatic C=C.

So, considering X could be an ester, which would have O-H in the IR? No, wait, esters don't have O-H unless it's an alcohol. Wait, no, esters have an O from the carbonyl and an OR group. So the 3400–2500 could be an alcohol's O-H, but X might not be an alcohol.

Wait, another possibility: the 3400–2500 cm-¹ is due to an aliphatic C-H stretch. For example, in a CH2 or CH3 group. But that's usually around 2800-3000. The broad region could also be due to an amine's N-H, but the options don't suggest amines.

Wait, perhaps the 3400–2500 is from an aromatic C-H stretch. Those are usually around 3000-3100 cm-¹, but the broadness suggests something else. Alternatively, it could be the O-H stretch of a phenol, but phenols have O-H around 3200-3600 cm-¹, which fits. But then, the IR would also show the aromatic C=O peak, which would be around 1600 cm-¹, but here it's 1720. So perhaps not.

Alternatively, maybe the O-H is from an alcohol, ester or something else.

This is getting complicated. Let me think about the NMR again.

The peak at 10.5 ppm is a singlet, broad, integrating to 1H. That's very high, so it's either an aldehyde or a carboxylic acid.

If X is an aldehyde, then the 1720 cm-¹ would correspond to the aldehyde's C=O. The aromatic protons would be split into two doublets, indicating a para-substituted benzaldehyde.

In that case, X would be something like 4-ethylbenzaldehyde.

But let's see, the NMR would have:

- 10.5 ppm: aldehyde proton.

- Aromatic protons at 8.0 and 7.2 ppm.

- The substituent's CH2CH2CH3 group would have peaks. For example, the ethyl group would have a triplet at 1.4 ppm (if it's attached to the ring) and a quartet at 0.9 ppm. But in the given data, the 0.9 is a triplet, which suggests it's connected to a CH2. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a butyl group. The signals from the substituent suggest a butyl group, perhaps a sec-butyl group.

So, putting it all together, if X is 4-(sec-butyl)benzaldehyde, then the IR would have a peak at 1720 (the aldehyde), and the NMR would show the aldehyde proton at 10.5 ppm. The aromatic protons would be at 8.0 and 7.2 ppm. The substituent's signals would match a sec-butyl group: 2.9 (CH), 1.7 (CH2), 1.4 (methyl attached to CH), and 0.9 (terminal methyl).

In that case, when X reacts with red phosphorus and HI, what happens? Aldehydes typically don't react in such a way. So perhaps that's not the case.

Wait, but if X is an acid chloride, then the product would be the acid. But the NMR of X doesn't fit an acid chloride.

I think I'm going around in circles. Let me recap.

The options are either benzoic acids or substituted benzene rings. The reaction converts X into one of these.

Given that, and the reaction condition, which suggests converting an acid chloride to a carboxylic acid, the correct product is either A or C.

Now, let's think about the structure of X.

If X is a benzaldehyde derivative with a substituent, but then the reaction doesn't make sense.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a phenyl ester, like phenyl propanoate. Then, the reaction would hydrolyze it to propanoic acid. But the options don't have that.

Wait, looking at option A: 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid.

Structure: the phenyl group is attached to the second carbon of propanoic acid. So, structure is Ph-CH2-COOH.

If X is the corresponding acid chloride, then after reaction, it becomes Ph-CH2-COOH.

Looking at NMR:

The aromatic protons would be two doublets, as the substituent is para.

The substituent would have a CH2 group, so in the NMR, there might be a quartet around 4 ppm (for the CH2 adjacent to the ring). But in our data, the substituent's NMR starts at 2.9 ppm.

Hmm, not matching.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a propanoic acid ester, like Ph-CH2-CO-O-R.

But I'm not making progress. Perhaps I should conclude that the correct answer is option C: 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid, because the NMR suggests a para-substituted benzoic acid with a sec-butyl group.


The question involves identifying the final product when Compound X reacts with red phosphorus and HI. The analysis begins by interpreting the spectroscopic data provided for Compound X:

### IR Data:
- **3400–2500 cm⁻¹**: Suggests the presence of an O-H or N-H stretch.
- **1720 cm⁻¹**: Indicates a strong carbonyl (C=O) group, likely from an ester or carboxylic acid.
- **1610 cm⁻¹ and 1450 cm⁻¹**: These peaks are consistent with aromatic C=C stretching, indicating the presence of a benzene ring.

### ¹H NMR Data:
- **10.5 ppm (bs, 1H)**: A very high chemical shift, characteristic of a carboxylic acid proton (-COOH).
- **8.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.2 ppm (d, 2H)**: Two doublets integrating to 2H each, consistent with a para-substituted benzene ring.
- **2.9 ppm (m, 1H)**: Likely corresponds to a CH group in a branched alkyl chain.
- **1.7 ppm (m, 2H)**: Likely corresponds to a CH₂ group in a branched alkyl chain.
- **1.4 ppm (d, 3H)**: Likely corresponds to a methyl group attached to a CH group.
- **0.9 ppm (t, 3H)**: Likely corresponds to a terminal methyl group in an alkyl chain.

### Reaction with Red Phosphorus and HI:
Red phosphorus and HI are typically used to convert acid chlorides to carboxylic acids. If Compound X is an acid chloride, the reaction would yield the corresponding carboxylic acid. However, the IR and NMR data suggest that Compound X is already a carboxylic acid, as indicated by the broad peak at 10.5 ppm (typical of a carboxylic acid proton) and the absence of peaks at higher wavenumbers (e.g., ~1800 cm⁻¹, which would indicate an acid chloride).

### Structure of Compound X:
The NMR data suggests that the benzene ring is para-substituted. One substituent is a carboxylic acid group (-COOH), as supported by the 10.5 ppm peak. The other substituent is a sec-butyl group (-CH₂CH(CH₂CH₃)), as indicated by the peaks at 2.9 ppm (m, 1H), 1.7 ppm (m, 2H), 1.4 ppm (d, 3H), and 0.9 ppm (t, 3H). Thus, Compound X is identified as **4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid**.

### Reaction and Final Product:
Since Compound X is already a carboxylic acid, the reaction with red phosphorus and HI does not alter its structure. Therefore, the final product remains **4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid**.

### Analysis of Options:
- **A) 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid**: This structure does not match the NMR data, as it would not produce the observed splitting pattern for the aromatic protons or the sec-butyl group.
- **B) 1-isobutyl-4-methylbenzene**: This is not a carboxylic acid and does not match the IR or NMR data.
- **C) 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid**: Matches the IR and NMR data perfectly, as it contains a para-substituted benzene ring with a -COOH group and a sec-butyl group.
- **D) 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene**: Similar to option B, this is not a carboxylic acid and does not match the IR or NMR data.

### Conclusion:
The correct answer is **C) 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid**, as it aligns with the spectroscopic data and the reaction conditions.
