Okay, so I'm trying to solve this multiple-choice question about stars and their effective temperatures based on the excitation of iron atoms in their photospheres. Hmm, I remember that when stars are in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE), the excitation of atoms in their atmospheres relates to the temperature. 

The question says that iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited as those in star_2. Oh right, the excitation here probably refers to the number of atoms in a specific energy level. So if star_1 has twice as many excited atoms as star_2, that must mean something about their temperatures. 

Wait, I think the Boltzmann equation is involved here. The Boltzmann distribution gives the population of particles in different energy states. The formula is something like (n_i / n_j) = exp( - (E_i - E_j) / (k*T) ), where k is Boltzmann's constant and T is the temperature.

So in this case, the number of excited atoms in star_1 compared to star_2 is 2. So I can set up the ratio as n1/n2 = 2. But wait, the energy difference E is given as 1.38e-23 J. Let me think about the denominator.

Let me write this out. For the same energy levels, the ratio of populations would be (n1/n2) = exp( (E)/(k*T1) ) * exp( (E)/(k*T2) )?), wait no. Wait, the Boltzmann factor is for the difference in energy. So if atoms are in an excited state, the higher energy state is less populated. 

Wait, more precisely, the ratio of the number of atoms in two states is (n_upper / n_lower) = exp( -ΔE/(kT) ), where ΔE is the energy difference between the upper and lower states. So if the energy levels are E1 and E2, with E1 higher than E2, then ΔE = E1 - E2.

In star_1, the excitation is twice that of star_2. So n_upper1 / n_upper2 = 2. Because n_upper is proportional to the number of excited atoms. 

So using the Boltzmann equation for each star:

For star_1: n_upper1 / n_lower1 = exp( -ΔE/(k T1) )
For star_2: n_upper2 / n_lower2 = exp( -ΔE/(k T2) )

But wait, since we're comparing the same element (iron
