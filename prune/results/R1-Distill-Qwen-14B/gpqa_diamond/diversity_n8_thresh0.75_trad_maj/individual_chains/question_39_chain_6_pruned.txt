Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Let me try to figure it out step by step. Hmm, the question is about finding the value of 'a' in the wave function. The wave function is given as (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i. And the condition is that when measuring the position of the particles, they were only found between x=1 and x=3. So, I think this relates to the normalization of the wave function.

Wait, right, wave functions must be normalized so that the total probability of finding the particle somewhere is 1. So, the integral of the absolute square of the wave function over all space should equal 1. But since the particles are only found between x=1 and x=3, the integral must be taken from 1 to 3.

Let me write down the wave function. It's ψ(x) = (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i. Hmm, wait, but the wave function is a complex function, right? The absolute square is ψ*ψ, so I need to compute the modulus squared.

Wait, modulus squared of a complex number (a + ib) is (a + ib)(a - ib) = a² + b². So, for ψ(x) = (a / sqrt(1+x)) + (-0.5i), the modulus squared would be [a²/(1+x)] + (0.5)^2. Because the real part is (a/sqrt(1+x)), so when squared, that's a²/(1+x), and the imaginary part is (0.5i),
