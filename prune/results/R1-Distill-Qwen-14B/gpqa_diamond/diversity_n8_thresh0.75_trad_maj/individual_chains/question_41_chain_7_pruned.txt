Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm trying to figure out the right answer. Let me read it again. The question says a light beam is propagating through a glass with index of refraction n. The glass is moving at a constant velocity v in the same direction as the beam and towards the observer in the laboratory. What's the speed of light in the glass relative to the observer?

Hmm, I remember that in physics, when dealing with velocities and different reference frames, sometimes you have to consider how different media affect the speed of light and how motion affects the observed speed. Let's break this down.

First, the speed of light in a medium, like glass, is generally v = c/n, where c is the speed of light in a vacuum. Since c is given as 1, the speed in glass should be 1/n. But wait, the glass itself is moving. Does that affect the speed observed in the lab frame?

Oh right, in classical mechanics, when you have an object moving in the same direction as another object, you might just add their velocities. But wait, that's only an approximation when velocities are much smaller than the speed of light. But in this problem, I'm not sure if the velocity v is significant compared to c. But since the options don't involve any relativistic formulas, maybe I can ignore relativity here and just use a classical approach.

Wait, but light's speed in a medium is already 1/n. So how does the glass moving at velocity v affect this? Let me think.

If the glass is moving towards the observer, and the light is moving in the same direction as the glass, then from the lab frame, the light's speed would be... Hmm. Let's say in the glass's rest frame, the light is moving at v_light = 1/n. But the glass itself is moving at velocity v. So would the lab frame see the light moving at v_light + v? Because if the glass is moving towards the observer, and the light is moving in the same direction (but same direction as the observer), wait, the glass is moving toward the observer in the same direction as the light. Wait, the light is moving toward the observer as well.

Wait, maybe it's better to think about it in terms of reference frames. Let me imagine two frames: the lab frame and the glass frame.

In the glass frame, the speed of light is 1/n. The glass is moving at velocity v relative to the lab. So to find the speed in the lab frame, I might need to use a velocity addition formula.

Wait, but the classical velocity addition formula is u' = u + v, where u is the velocity
