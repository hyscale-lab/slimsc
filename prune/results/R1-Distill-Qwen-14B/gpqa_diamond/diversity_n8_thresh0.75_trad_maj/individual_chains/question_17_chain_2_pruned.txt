Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let me read the question again carefully.

The question is about finding the concentration of calcium ions in a solution. The solution contains 0.02 M of a stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex. We're told that the pH is ideal, and the temperature is 25°C. The formation constant, K_Ca-EDTA, is 5x10^10. The options are A to D, and I need to pick the correct one.

Hmm, I remember that EDTA is a chelating agent, which means it binds metal ions like calcium. The complex formed is CaEDTA^2- maybe? So the problem is about the dissociation of this complex in solution.

Wait, formation constants. Oh right, the formation constant (Kf) tells us how much the complex is formed. The formula for Kf is [CaEDTA^2-]/([Ca^2+][EDTA^4-]). So if the complex dissociates, the concentration of free Ca^2+ would be low because Kf is large, meaning the complex is stable.

So the solution is 0.02 M Ca-EDTA complex. Let me denote the complex as CaY^2- where Y is EDTA. So the initial concentration of CaY^2- is 0.02 M.

When it dissociates, the reaction is CaY^2- ↔ Ca^2+ + Y^4-. So, the change would be: let's say it dissociates by x. Then, at equilibrium, [CaY^2-] = 0.02 - x ≈ 0.02 (since x might be very small due to the large Kf).

The concentrations of Ca^2+ and Y^4- would each be x. So plugging into the Kf equation:

Kf = [CaY^2-]/([Ca^2+][Y^4-]) = 0.02 / (x * x) = 0.02 / x² = 5e10.

Wait, so 0.02 / x² = 5e10. Let me solve for x. Rearranging, x² = 0.02 / (5e10) = 0.02 / (5 * 10^10) = (2e-2) / (5e10) = (2/5)
