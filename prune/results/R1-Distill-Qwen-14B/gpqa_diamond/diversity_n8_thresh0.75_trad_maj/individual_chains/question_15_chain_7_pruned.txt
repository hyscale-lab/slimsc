Okay, so I've got this question about detecting transiting planets, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question says.

So, there are two planets, Planet_1 and Planet_2. Both are Earth-like and have been detected via the radial velocity (RV) method. That means we know their minimum masses and orbital periods. But the question is about which one is more likely to transit, so we can determine which to observe with limited time.

The planets have the same mass. But Planet_1 has an orbital period three times shorter than Planet_2. So, P1 is shorter. Both have circular orbits, which probably simplifies things a bit because eccentricity can affect transit probability but here they're both zero.

The host stars: the star for Planet_1 has twice the mass of Planet_2's star. But both stars have the same radii. Interesting. Wait, normally, more massive stars are bigger, but the host of Planet_2 is slightly evolved. Hmm. Oh, slightly evolved stars (like subgiants or giants) can have different properties. So, if Planet_1's star is twice as massive as Planet_2's but same radius, that might mean something about their densities or luminosities.

The question is about the probability of a transit. I remember that the probability of a planet transiting its star from our point of view depends on the size of the planet and the star, as well as the planet's orbital distance.

The formula for the transit probability is roughly (R_p / R_s)^2 multiplied by some factor depending on the orbital period. Wait, no, actually, the geometric probability is more accurate. The probability is proportional to (R_p / R_s)^2, but also depends on the inclination. Since the RV method already finds the planet, we know the minimum mass, but the inclination isn't known unless we have the transit. So for the purpose of selecting which planet is more probable to transit, assuming both have the same mass (so similar R_p, but maybe not exactly, but Earth-like radii are about same), but wait, the question says the planets have the same masses, but mass doesn't directly tell us about radius unless we know the density. Wait, but Earth-like planets, if they have the same mass, their radii should be similar. So maybe we can assume R_p for both is the same.

Alternatively, perhaps the question abstracts away planet radius and focuses on other factors. So, the probability of a transit depends on the orbital period and the star's size.
