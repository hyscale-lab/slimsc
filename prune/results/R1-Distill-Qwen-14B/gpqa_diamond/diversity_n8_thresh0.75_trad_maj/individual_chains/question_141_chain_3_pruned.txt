Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. Let's see what it's about. The question is about treating 1-bromobenzene-2-d with NaNH2 in a condensed ammonia solvent. I need to figure out how many possible organic products there are. The options are A)4, B)1, C)2, D)3.

Hmm, first, I should probably draw the structure of the starting material. 1-bromobenzene-2-d... Wait, wait, benzene with two substituents? 1-bromo-2-d something. Oh, wait, maybe the "d" is a typo? Or perhaps it's a deuterium. Because sometimes in such compounds, especially in substitution reactions, they substitute with deuterium. Oh, right, sometimes when they say "d", it might mean deuterium, like a benzene ring with a Br and a D, or maybe two deuteriums? Hmm.

Wait, the name is 1-bromobenzene-2-d. So, benzene ring with substituents at positions 1 and 2. Position 1 is Br, position 2 is maybe a deuterium. Or perhaps it's a typo and it's 1-bromo-2-dichlorobenzene? No, the question says 1-bromobenzene-2-d. Hmm, maybe it's a benzene with Br at position 1 and a deuterium at position 2. That makes sense, maybe a di-substituted benzene with Br and D.

But wait, maybe it's 1-bromo-2-deutero benzene.
