Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I need to figure out the kinetic energy of the product particles after a pion decays. Hmm, let's see. The reaction is Pi(+) at rest decaying into a muon(+) and a neutrino. The question is about finding the kinetic energies of these products.

Wait, the given masses are the rest masses. Pi(+) is 139.6 MeV, and the muon is 105.7 MeV. Oh right, neutrinos are tricky because they have almost zero mass, but in this case, since the pion is at rest, I think the neutrino's energy might be considered as negligible or maybe they're just using the rest mass of the muon for calculation.

So the problem is about conservation of energy and momentum. Since the pion is initially at rest, the total momentum before decay is zero. So after decay, the momenta of the muon and neutrino must cancel each other out. But wait, neutrinos are leptons, so they carry away some energy and momentum. Hmm, but since the pion is at rest, the total momentum of the products must sum to zero. 

Let me think. The pion's rest mass is 139.6 MeV, and the muon's rest mass is 105.7 MeV. The neutrino is massless for approximation purposes, so its energy is just its momentum times c (but since we're working in units where c=1, that's the same as its momentum).

So the total energy before decay is just the pion's rest energy, which is 139.6 MeV. After decay, the energies of the muon and neutrino must sum to this. Also, their momenta must be equal and opposite because the pion was at rest.

Let me denote the muon's momentum as p, and the neutrino's as -p. So the muon's energy would be sqrt(p^2 c^2 + m_mu^2 c^4), but since c=1, that's sqrt(p^2 + m_mu^2). Similarly, the neutrino's energy is just |p|.

So the total energy after decay is sqrt(p^2 + m_mu^2) + p = 139.6 MeV.

And the total momentum is p - p = 0, which is correct.

So I can set up the equation: sqrt(p^2 + m_muÂ²) + p = M_pi.
