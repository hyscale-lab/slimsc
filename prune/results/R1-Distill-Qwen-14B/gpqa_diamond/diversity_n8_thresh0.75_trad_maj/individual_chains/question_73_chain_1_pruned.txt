Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds, and I need to find the relative speed between them and the total energy of the system. Hmm, relativistic speeds—so I should probably use the theory of relativity here. Let me think.

The problem says the astronauts have masses 2m and 3m. The first is moving at 0.6c, the second at 0.5c, both in the positive x-direction. Wait, but since they're both moving in the same direction, the relative speed isn't just 0.6c minus 0.5c, is it? No, because at such high speeds, you can't just subtract them normally. Oh right, you need to use the relativistic velocity addition formula.

The formula for relative velocity when two objects are moving in the same direction is v_rel = (u - v)/(1 - (uv)/c²). So u is the speed of the first astronaut from the perspective of the second. Or wait, wait, maybe I should define the frame of reference. Let me clarify.

Wait, the question is about the relative speed of the two astronauts. So from the perspective of one astronaut, what is the speed of the other? Let's pick astronaut A as the first one moving at 0.6c, and astronaut B as the second moving at 0.5c. So we want to find the speed of B relative to A, since both are moving in the same direction.

So, using the velocity addition formula: v_rel = (v_B - v_A) / (1 - (v_A v_B)/c²). Wait no, because if we're in A's frame
