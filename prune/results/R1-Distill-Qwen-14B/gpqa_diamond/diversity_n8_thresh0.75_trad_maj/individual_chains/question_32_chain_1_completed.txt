Okay, so I've got this physics problem in front of me. It's about calculating the energy of the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) where the speed of a nucleus is 0.96c. Hmm, I need to find the correct energy from the given options. Let's think through this step by step.

First, I remember that when dealing with relativistic speeds, we can't use classical mechanics because the speeds are a significant fraction of the speed of light. So, I'll need to use the theory of relativity, specifically the relativistic energy equations.

The nucleus in question is X, which is Lithium (Li) with 3 neutrons. Wait, so Li typically has 3 protons. If it has 3 neutrons, that would make it Li-6, right? Because 3 protons + 3 neutrons = 6 nucleons. So the mass number A is 6, and the atomic number Z is 3. So the nucleus is ^6Li.

The first thing I need is the rest mass of the ^6Li nucleus. But wait, do I remember the exact value? I'm not sure. Maybe I should think about how to find it. The rest mass would be the sum of the masses of the protons and neutrons minus the mass defect (binding energy), but perhaps for this problem, I can look up the approximate mass.

Alternatively, I can recall that the mass of a nucleus is approximately the sum of the masses of its nucleons minus the binding energy, but maybe I can find an approximate value. Alternatively, I might remember that the mass of a proton is about 938 MeV/c² and a neutron is about 939 MeV/c². Let's see: 3 protons and 3 neutrons.

So the total rest mass would be 3*(938) + 3*(939) = let's calculate that. 3*938 is 2814, 3*939 is 2817. Summing those gives 2814 + 2817 = 5631 MeV. But wait, that's without considering the binding energy. The actual mass should be slightly less because the binding energy (mass defect) reduces the total mass.

But for an approximate calculation, maybe I can use the mass of ^6Li directly. Alternatively, perhaps I can look it up as a known value. Wait, I think the mass of ^6Li is approximately 6 * 938.272 MeV/c² minus some binding energy. Wait, but I'm not confident about the exact value. Alternatively, perhaps I can find it by considering that the mass of ^6Li is about 6.014 atomic mass units (u). Oh wait, 1 u is about 931.5 MeV/c², so 6.014 u * 931.5 MeV/u would give the rest mass in MeV.

Calculating that: 6 * 931.5 is 5589 MeV. 0.014 * 931.5 is approximately 13.041 MeV. So total around 5589 + 13.041 = 5602.041 MeV. Hmm, but I'm not sure if that's correct. Maybe I should use a precise value. Let me think again: I'll probably have to proceed with an approximate value, but perhaps the exact value is given or I can look it up.

Alternatively, perhaps for the sake of calculation, it's better to use the mass of the nucleus in terms of u. Let's just proceed with the calculation, perhaps it's better to calculate using the rest mass energy.

Wait, the problem is to find the total energy of the nucleus moving at 0.96c. The total energy E is gamma multiplied by the rest energy (m c²), where gamma is the Lorentz factor.

Gamma is given by 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²). So for v = 0.96c, let's compute gamma.

Calculating 1 - (0.96)^2 = 1 - 0.9216 = 0.0784. Sqrt of that is sqrt(0.0784) = 0.28. So gamma is 1/0.28 ≈ 3.5714. Wait, wait, let me double-check that calculation. 0.96 squared is 0.9216, so 1 - 0.9216 is 0.0784. The square root of 0.0784 is 0.28. So yes, gamma is 1/0.28 which is approximately 3.5714286.

Hmm, but let me calculate it more accurately. Let's compute the exact value.

v = 0.96c.

v²/c² = (0.96)^2 = 0.9216.

1 - v²/c² = 0.0784.

sqrt(0.0784) = sqrt(784/10000) = 28/100 = 0.28. So gamma is 1/0.28 = 3.57142857...

But wait, is that correct? Let me compute 1/0.28 more accurately. 0.28 is 28/100, so 100/28 = (25*4)/(7*4) )= 25/7 ≈ 3.57142857.

So gamma is approximately 3.57142857.

Now, the total energy E of the nucleus is gamma multiplied by m c². But I need the rest mass m of the ^6Li nucleus.

Wait, so what's the rest mass energy of ^6Li?

The standard atomic weight of ^6Li is about 6.014 atomic mass units (u). So 6.014 u multiplied by 931.5 MeV/u gives the rest energy in MeV.

Calculating 6.014 * 931.5 = let's compute that.

6 * 931.5 = 5589.

0.014 * 931.5 = 13.041.

Adding together: 5589 +13.041 = 5602.041 MeV. So m c² is 5602.041 MeV.

Now, the total energy E is gamma * m c².

Gamma is roughly 3.57142857.

So E = 3.57142857 * 5602.041 MeV.

Let me compute that.

First, compute 3 * 5602.041 = 16,806.123 MeV.

Then 0.57142857 * 5602.041.

Wait, 0.57142857 is approximately 4/7, since 4/7 is about 0.57142857.

So 4/7 of 5602.041 is (5602.041 *4)/7.

5602.041 *4 = 22,408.164.

Divide by 7: 22,408.164 /7 ≈ 3,201.166 MeV.

So the total E is 16,806.123 + 3,201.166 = 20,007.289 MeV.

Wait, but wait, wait. 3.57142857 is 25/7? Let me confirm: 25/7 is approximately 3.57142857. So 3.57142857 = 25/7.

So perhaps it's better to compute E as (25/7) * 5602.041 MeV.

So 25 * 5602.041 = 140,051.025. Divide by 7: 140,051.025 /7 = 20,007.289 MeV.

So approximately 20,007.289 MeV, which is about 20.007 GeV.

But wait, I'm getting approximately 20 GeV. Let me check the options. The options are A) 18.475, B)23.069, C)20.132, D)21.419.

Hmm, my calculation gave about 20.007 GeV. The closest option is C) 20.132 GeV. But wait, maybe I made a mistake in the rest mass energy.

Wait, perhaps the mass of ^6Li is more accurately known. Let me double-check the exact mass. I think the precise mass is about 6.014 u, but perhaps the exact value is 6.0144u. Let me compute 6.0144 u * 931.5 MeV/u.

6.0144 * 931.5 = let me calculate.

6 *931.5 = 5589.

0.0144 *931.5 = let's compute that.

0.01 *931.5 =9.315.

0.004 *931.5=3.726.

So 9.315 +3.726 =13.041.

Wait, no, wait: 0.0144 is 0.01 + 0.004, but wait, 0.0144 is 0.01 + 0.0044?

Wait, perhaps I should compute 0.0144 *931.5.

Let me compute 931.5 *0.0144.

931.5 *0.01 =9.315.

931.5 *0.004 = 3.726.

931.5 *0.0004 = 0.3726.

Adding them together: 9.315 +3.726 =13.041, plus 0.3726 gives 13.4136.

So 6.0144 *931.5 =5589 +13.4136 =5602.4136 MeV.

So E = 25/7 *5602.4136 MeV.

25/7 is approximately 3.57142857.

So 5602.4136 *3.57142857 = let's compute.

5602.4136 *3 =16,807.2408.

5602.4136 *0.57142857 = let's compute.

0.57142857 is 4/7, so 4/7 *5602.4136 = (5602.4136 *4)/7.

5602.4136 *4 =22,409.6544.

22,409.6544 /7 ≈3,201.3792.

So total E = 16,807.2408 +3,201.3792 = 20,008.62 MeV, which is 20.00862 GeV.

Hmm, but the option C is 20.132 GeV, which is a bit higher than my calculation. Did I make a mistake in the rest mass?

Wait, perhaps the rest mass is actually higher than 5602.41 MeV? Let me check the actual mass of ^6Li.

Wait, I think I might have confused the exact value. Let me look it up: the exact mass of ^6Li is approximately 6.0144 u, as I used earlier. So that gives 6.0144 u *931.5 MeV/u = 5602.414 MeV.

But maybe the exact value is different. Alternatively, perhaps the question uses a different mass. Alternatively, perhaps I should use the mass of a single nucleon and calculate the sum, but that approach neglects the binding energy, leading to a higher mass. Let me think.

Wait, the mass of a proton is about 938.272 MeV/c², and a neutron is about 939.565 MeV/c². So 3 protons and 3 neutrons would sum to 3*(938.272 +939.565) = 3*(1877.837) = 5633.511 MeV.

But the actual mass of ^6Li is less than that because of binding energy. So if the actual mass is 6.0144 u, then 6.0144 *931.5 MeV/u is correct.

Wait, but perhaps I should use more precise values. Let me compute using more precise numbers.

Let me recalculate everything with precise numbers.

First, compute gamma again.

v = 0.96c.

gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.96)^2) = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.9216) = 1/sqrt(0.0784) =1/0.28 =3.57142857.

Now, the rest mass of ^6Li: I'll use 6.0144 u.

1 u = 931.494065 MeV/c².

So 6.0144 u * 931.494065 MeV/u.

Compute that:

6 *931.494065 = 5,588.96439.

Now, 0.0144 *931.494065 = let's compute:

0.01 *931.494065 =9.31494065.

0.004 *931.494065 =3.72597626.

0.0004 *931.494065 = 0.372597626.

Adding those: 9.31494065 +3.72597626 =13.04091691 +0.372597626 =13.413514536.

So total rest energy is 5,588.96439 +13.413514536 =5,602.3779 MeV. Approximately 5602.3779 MeV.

So E = gamma * m c² =3.57142857 *5602.3779 MeV.

Compute that:

3 *5602.3779 = 16,807.1337 MeV.

0.57142857 *5602.3779 = ?

Well, 5602.3779 * (4/7) = (5602.3779 *4) /7.

5602.3779 *4 =22,409.5116.

22,409.5116 /7 = 3,201.3588 MeV.

So total E = 16,807.1337 +3,201.3588 =20,008.4925 MeV.

Which is approximately 20.00849 GeV.

Looking at the options, option C is 20.132 GeV, which is a bit higher than my calculated 20.008 GeV. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake in the rest mass.

Wait, perhaps I should use a more accurate value for the mass of ^6Li.

Let me check: The exact mass of ^6Li is 6.014400 u.

So 6.014400 u * 931.494065 MeV/u.

Let me compute that precisely.

6.014400 * 931.494065:

Compute 6 *931.494065 =5588.96439.

0.0144 *931.494065 = let's compute exact.

0.01 *931.494065 =9.31494065.

0.004 *931.494065 =3.72597626.

0.0004 *931.494065 =0.372597626.

So 9.31494065 +3.72597626 =13.04091691 +0.372597626 =13.413514536.

So total is 5588.96439 +13.413514536 =5602.37790 MeV.

So same as before. Then, E=3.57142857 *5602.37790 MeV.

So 3.57142857 *5602.3779.

Another approach: let's compute 5602.3779 *3.57142857.

Perhaps using calculator-like steps.

Let me compute 5602.3779 *3 =16,807.1337.

5602.3779 *0.57142857 = ?

We can represent 0.57142857 as 4/7.

So 5602.3779 *4 =22,409.5116.

Divide by 7: 22,409.5116 /7 =3,201.3588.

So adding 16,807.1337 +3,201.3588 =20,008.4925 MeV → 20.00849 GeV.

But the options don't have 20.008 GeV. The closest is option C) 20.132. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the rest mass. Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects using the mass of a single nucleon without considering binding energy, which would give a higher mass and thus a higher energy.

Wait, earlier I calculated the sum of the protons and neutrons without considering binding energy, which was 5633.511 MeV. If I used that as the rest mass, the calculation would be different.

Wait, but that's not correct, because the actual mass of the nucleus is less than the sum of its parts due to binding energy (mass defect). So using the sum would give a higher rest mass, leading to a higher total energy, which would match option C.

But that approach would be wrong, because the actual mass of ^6Li is known and is about 6.014 u. So perhaps the mistake lies elsewhere.

Wait, perhaps I should double-check the calculation of gamma.

Wait, v=0.96c.

v²/c² = (0.96)^2 =0.9216.

1 - v²/c² = 0.0784.

sqrt(0.0784) =0.28.

So gamma=1/0.28=3.57142857.

That's correct.

So where is the discrepancy between my calculation (~20 GeV) and the options?

Looking at the options, option C is 20.132 GeV. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the rest mass.

Wait, perhaps the mass of ^6Li is not 6.014 u, but perhaps I should use the exact value.

Alternatively, perhaps the mass of ^6Li is 6.014400 u, which gives 6.014400 *931.494065 = ?

Wait, let me compute 6.0144 *931.494065.

Compute it step by step:

6 *931.494065 =5588.96439.

0.0144 *931.494065 = let's compute.

0.01 *931.494065 =9.31494065.

0.0044 *931.494065 =let's compute:

0.004 *931.494065=3.72597626.

0.0004 *931.494065=0.372597626.

So 3.72597626 +0.372597626 =4.098573886.

Wait, wait, no. 0.0044 is 0.004 +0.0004. So 0.004 part is 3.72597626, 0.0004 part is 0.372597626. So sum is 3.72597626 +0.372597626 =4.098573886.

So 0.0144 *931.494065 =9.31494065 +4.098573886 =13.413514536.

So 6 *931.494065 is 5588.96439, plus 13.413514536 gives 5602.37790 MeV.

So that's correct. Then, E=3.57142857 *5602.37790 MeV.

Let me calculate this more accurately.

5602.37790 *3.57142857.

Another approach: compute 5602.37790 * 3.57142857.

We can write this as (5602.3779 * 25) /7.

Because 3.57142857 is 25/7.

So 5602.3779 *25 = let's compute.

5602.3779 *20 =112,047.558.

5602.3779 *5=28,011.8895.

Adding them gives 112,047.558 +28,011.8895 =140,059.4475.

Now, divide by 7: 140,059.4475 /7 = 20,008.4925 MeV.

Which is 20.0084925 GeV.

But the option C is 20.132 GeV, which is about 0.123 GeV higher. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects the calculation without considering the binding energy, using the sum of the individual nucleon masses.

Wait, that would give a higher rest mass and thus a higher energy. Let's try that approach.

Wait, the rest mass without accounting for binding energy would be 3 protons and 3 neutrons.

Mass of proton: 938.272 MeV/c².

Mass of neutron: 939.565 MeV/c².

Total: 3*(938.272 +939.565) =3*(1877.837) =5633.511 MeV.

Then, E = gamma * m c² =3.57142857 *5633.511 MeV.

Calculate that.

3.57142857 *5633.511 =?

Let me compute:

5633.511 *3 =16,900.533.

5633.511 *0.57142857 = ?

Again, 0.57142857 is 4/7.

So 5633.511 *4 =22,534.044.

Divide by 7: 22,534.044 /7 ≈3,219.149.

So total E=16,900.533 +3,219.149 ≈20,119.682 MeV → 20.119682 GeV.

That's about 20.1197 GeV. Now, looking at the options, option C is 20.132 GeV, which is very close.

Ah, so perhaps the problem expects the calculation without considering the binding energy, i.e., using the sum of the rest masses of the nucleons.

Wait, but that's not correct in reality, because the actual mass of a nucleus is less than the sum of its nucleons. But maybe the problem simplifies it that way.

If I proceed with that approach, the energy would be approximately 20.1197 GeV, which is close to option C's 20.132 GeV. The slight discrepancy might be due to more precise values used in the calculation.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem uses the relativistic energy formula with the rest mass of the entire nucleus, which includes the binding energy.

Wait, but in that case, the correct value is about 20.008 GeV, which is not an option. The closest option is C) 20.132 GeV.

Hmm, but wait, perhaps I should check my calculation again. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the rest mass.

Wait, perhaps the correct rest mass is 6.0144 u, which gives 6.0144 *931.494065 =5602.3779 MeV. Then, E=3.57142857 *5602.3779 =20.008 GeV.

But none of the options match that exactly. So perhaps I should consider that the problem expects the use of the sum of proton and neutron masses, leading to option C.

Alternatively, perhaps the given options have a typo. But given the options, the correct option based on my calculation using the actual rest mass would be approximately 20.008 GeV, which is very close to option C (20.132), but perhaps the intended correct answer is option C because of the method used.

Wait, but why is there a discrepancy? Let me recheck the gamma calculation.

Wait, when v is 0.96c, the gamma is correct as 3.57142857.

So perhaps the problem has a typo, or perhaps I'm missing something.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that the nucleus is moving relativistically, and the kinetic energy is being asked, but the question says "energy of the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC)" which is the total energy, not the kinetic.

Wait, the total energy is E=gamma * m c². So in that case, my calculation with the actual rest mass gives about 20.008 GeV, but the option C is 20.132, which is about 0.124 GeV higher.

Wait, perhaps I made a miscalculation in the rest mass. Let me recompute 6.0144 u *931.494065 MeV/u.

6.0144 *931.494065.

Let me compute 6 *931.494065 =5588.96439.

0.0144 *931.494065.

0.01 *931.494065 =9.31494065.

0.0044 *931.494065.

Well, 931.494065 *0.004 =3.72597626.

931.494065 *0.0004 =0.372597626.

So 3.72597626 +0.372597626 =4.098573886.

So 9.31494065 +4.098573886=13.413514536.

Adding to 5588.96439: 5588.96439 +13.413514536 =5602.37790 MeV.

So that's correct.

Then E=3.57142857 *5602.37790.

Compute this accurately:

5602.37790 *3.57142857.

Let me compute 5602.3779 *25/7.

So 5602.3779 *25 =140,059.4475.

Divide by 7: 140,059.4475 /7 =20,008.4925 MeV →20.0084925 GeV.

Hmm, so 20.008 GeV is the answer, but that's not an option. The options are:

A) 18.475 GeV

B)23.069 GeV

C)20.132 GeV

D)21.419 GeV

So the closest is option C, but 20.132 is higher than 20.008.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use a different approach. Wait, perhaps the problem is considering the entire nucleus as a particle, so perhaps the mass is the mass number times the mass of a proton, but that would be incorrect.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the problem uses the speed as 0.96c, but the relativistic energy includes the rest mass. So perhaps the energy is calculated correctly, but perhaps I made a mistake with units.

Wait, 5602.3779 MeV is 5.6023779 GeV.

Wait, no, 5602.3779 MeV is 5.6023779 GeV? Wait no, 1 GeV is 1000 MeV. So 5602.3779 MeV is 5.6023779 GeV? No, wait, 5602.3779 MeV is 5.6023779 GeV * 1000. No, wait, 5602 MeV is 5.602 GeV.

Because 1 GeV =10^9 eV, and 1 MeV=10^6 eV. So 1 GeV=1000 MeV. So 5602.3779 MeV is 5.6023779 GeV.

Wait no! That can't be right. Wait, 5602.3779 MeV is 5602.3779 /1000 GeV, which is 5.6023779 GeV.

Wait, that can't be correct because 5602.3779 MeV is 5.602 GeV. But then, when multiplied by gamma=3.5714, gives 5.602 *3.5714 ≈20 GeV.

Wait, but 5.6 GeV times 3.57 is about 20 GeV, which aligns with our previous calculation.

So I think I'm confident that the correct energy is approximately 20.008 GeV. But that's not an option. So perhaps I made a mistake in the initial approach.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the problem is referring to the kinetic energy instead of the total energy. But the question specifically asks for the energy of the collider, which is the total energy.

The kinetic energy (K) is (gamma -1) mc². So if the problem had asked for kinetic energy, the calculation would be different.

But the question is about the total energy, so I think my approach is correct.

So given the options, the closest is option C)20.132 GeV, which is about 20.13 GeV. But my calculation gives 20.008 GeV. Perhaps the intended answer is option C because of the method used, such as neglecting the binding energy.

Alternatively, perhaps I should recheck the rest mass of ^6Li. Let me look up the exact value.

Upon checking, the exact rest mass of ^6Li is approximately 6.014400 u. So 6.014400 u *931.494065 MeV/u =5602.3779 MeV.

So perhaps the option C is correct due to a miscalculation elsewhere. Or perhaps the problem expects more precise gamma calculation.

Wait, let me compute gamma more precisely. Gamma = 1/sqrt(1 - (0.96)^2) = 1/sqrt(0.0784).

Compute sqrt(0.0784) more accurately.

0.28^2 =0.0784, so sqrt(0.0784)=0.28 exactly. So gamma=3.57142857.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial step of identifying the nucleus. The problem says nucleus X is Li with 3 neutrons. So X is ^6Li, correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the mass is taken differently, such as using the average mass per nucleon. Or perhaps I should use the atomic mass, including electrons.

Wait, in nucleus calculations, the electrons are not part of the nucleus. So the mass of the nucleus is the atomic mass minus the mass of the electrons, but for heavy elements, the electrons' mass is negligible. But for light elements like Li, perhaps it's not negligible.

Wait, ^6Li has 3 protons and 3 neutrons, so the atomic number Z is 3. That means each atom has 3 electrons.

So the mass of the atom is the mass of the nucleus plus the mass of the electrons.

But the problem is about the nucleus, so perhaps the rest mass is the atomic mass minus the electrons' mass.

Wait, the atomic mass of ^6Li is approximately 6.014400 u.

So the mass of the nucleus is atomic mass minus the mass of 3 electrons.

Because in the neutral atom, there are 3 electrons.

Each electron has a mass of about 0.00054858 u.

So 3 electrons: 3 *0.00054858 =0.00164574 u.

So nucleus mass =6.014400 u -0.00164574 u =6.01275426 u.

Hmm, so that's a slight adjustment. Let's compute that.

6.01275426 u *931.494065 MeV/u = ?

Compute 6 *931.494065 =5588.96439.

0.01275426 *931.494065 = let's compute.

0.01 *931.494065 =9.31494065.

0.00275426 *931.494065 ≈0.00275426 *931.494 = approximately 2.564 MeV.

So total is 9.31494065 +2.564 =11.87894065 MeV.

So the rest energy is 5588.96439 +11.87894065 =5600.84333 MeV.

So E = gamma *5600.84333 MeV.

Compute 5600.84333 *3.57142857 = ?

Again, 5600.84333 *3 =16,802.53 MeV.

5600.84333 *0.57142857 = ?

0.57142857 is 4/7, so (5600.84333 *4)/7.

5600.84333 *4=22,403.37332.

Divide by 7: 22,403.37332 /7 ≈3,200.4819 MeV.

So total E=16,802.53 +3,200.4819 =20,003.01 MeV →20.00301 GeV.

Still, it's about 20.003 GeV. So this adjustment brings the rest mass down a bit, but it's still not matching any option.

Hmm, perhaps the problem expects not considering the electrons, so using the atomic mass directly as the nucleus' mass. So in that case, the initial calculation of 20.008 GeV holds.

But none of the options match that. So perhaps the intended answer is C) 20.132 GeV, considering using the sum of protons and neutrons without the binding energy.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem uses a different value for c. But I think c is taken as 3e8 m/s, but the units here are in GeV, so the exact value of c shouldn't affect the calculation in MeV/u.

Alternatively, perhaps the rest mass is given as 6.0144 GeV/c². Wait, 6.0144 u is 6.0144 *931.494 MeV = approximately 5602.3779 MeV, which is about 5.602 GeV. So E=gamma *5.602 GeV =3.57142857 *5.602 ≈20.008 GeV.

But again, that doesn't match any option.

Alternatively, perhaps I should take the mass as 6.0144 *931.5 =5602.5 MeV, then E=3.57142857 *5602.5 =20,008.9 MeV →20.0089 GeV.

Hmm.

Wait, looking back at the options, option C is 20.132 GeV. Maybe I should compute more precise gamma, perhaps considering more decimal places in gamma.

Alternatively, perhaps the gamma calculation needs more precision.

Wait, the exact value of gamma when v=0.96c.

gamma =1/sqrt(1 - (0.96)^2) =1/sqrt(0.0784)=1/0.28=3.57142857.

But perhaps in reality, 0.96^2 is 0.9216, so 1-0.9216=0.0784.

sqrt(0.0784)=0.28, so gamma is exactly 3.57142857.

Hmm. Maybe the discrepancy comes from using more precise values for the rest mass.

Wait, the exact mass of ^6Li is 6.014400 u. So let me compute the exact value in MeV/c².

6.014400 u *931.494065 MeV/u = ?

Compute 6.014400 *931.494065:

Calculate as:

6 *931.494065 =5,588.96439.

0.014400 *931.494065 = compute 0.0144 *931.494065.

0.01 *931.494065 =9.31494065.

0.004 *931.494065 =3.72597626.

0.0004 *931.494065 =0.372597626.

So 9.31494065 +3.72597626 =13.04091691 +0.372597626 =13.413514536.

So total rest energy is 5,588.96439 +13.413514536 =5,602.37790 MeV.

So E=3.57142857 *5602.37790 MeV =20,008.4925 MeV →20.0085 GeV.

But option C is 20.132 GeV. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the mass of ^6Li. Let me check a reliable source.

Upon checking, the exact mass of ^6Li is 6.014400 u. So I think my calculation is correct.

Another possibility: perhaps the problem uses the rest energy in GeV and more precise calculations.

Let me recalculate E with more precise numbers.

E =3.57142857 *5602.3779 MeV.

5602.3779 MeV =5.6023779 GeV.

So E =3.57142857 *5.6023779 GeV.

Compute this:

3.57142857 *5.6023779.

Let me compute 3.57142857 *5.6:

3 *5.6 =16.8.

0.57142857 *5.6 =3.199999992 → approximately 3.2.

So total is 20.0.

But more precisely:

5.6023779 *3.57142857.

Let me compute 5.6023779 *3.57142857.

Using a calculator approach:

5.6023779 *3 =16.8071337.

5.6023779 *0.57142857 = ?

0.57142857 is approximately 4/7. So 5.6023779 *4 =22.4095116.

22.4095116 /7 =3.2013588.

So total E =16.8071337 +3.2013588 =20.0084925 GeV.

Which again brings me back to about 20.0085 GeV.

But none of the options match this. So perhaps the correct option is C)20.132 GeV, but I must have made a mistake in the approach.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects the use of the sum of the rest masses of the individual nucleons without considering binding energy. Let's compute that.

Each proton:938.272 MeV.

Each neutron:939.565 MeV.

3 protons:3 *938.272 =2814.816 MeV.

3 neutrons:3 *939.565 =2818.695 MeV.

Total:2814.816 +2818.695 =5633.511 MeV.

Gamma is 3.57142857.

E=3.57142857 *5633.511 MeV.

Compute:

5633.511 *3=16,900.533 MeV.

5633.511 *0.57142857 = (5633.511 *4)/7 =22,534.044 /7 ≈3,219.149 MeV.

Total:16,900.533 +3,219.149 =20,119.682 MeV →20.119682 GeV.

Which is approximately 20.1197 GeV. So option C is 20.132 GeV, which is very close.

So perhaps the problem expects this approach, ignoring the binding energy.

In that case, the correct answer would be option C)20.132 GeV.


To determine the energy of the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) for a nucleus moving at 0.96c, we use the relativistic energy formula:

\[
E = \gamma m c^2
\]

where \( \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}} \), \( v = 0.96c \), and \( m \) is the rest mass of the nucleus. The nucleus in question is \( ^6\text{Li} \), which has a rest mass of approximately \( 6.0144 \, \text{u} \). Converting this to MeV/c² using \( 1 \, \text{u} = 931.494065 \, \text{MeV/c}^2 \), the rest energy is:

\[
m c^2 = 6.0144 \times 931.494065 \, \text{MeV} \approx 5602.3779 \, \text{MeV}.
\]

The Lorentz factor \( \gamma \) is calculated as:

\[
\gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - (0.96)^2}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.0784}} = \frac{1}{0.28} \approx 3.57142857.
\]

The total energy is then:

\[
E = \gamma m c^2 = 3.57142857 \times 5602.3779 \, \text{MeV} \approx 20,008.4925 \, \text{MeV} \, \text{(or } 20.008 \, \text{GeV)}.
\]

This calculation yields approximately \( 20.008 \, \text{GeV} \). However, none of the provided options match this value exactly. To reconcile this, the problem may assume the rest mass is calculated without accounting for binding energy, using the sum of the individual nucleon masses. The rest mass in this case is:

\[
m = 3 \times 938.272 \, \text{MeV} + 3 \times 939.565 \, \text{MeV} = 5633.511 \, \text{MeV}.
\]

Using this rest mass, the total energy becomes:

\[
E = \gamma m c^2 = 3.57142857 \times 5633.511 \, \text{MeV} \approx 20,119.682 \, \text{MeV} \, \text{(or } 20.1197 \, \text{GeV)}.
\]

This value is very close to option C (\( 20.132 \, \text{GeV} \)). Given the discrepancy between the actual rest mass and the problem's expected approach, the most reasonable conclusion is that the problem assumes the sum of nucleon masses without binding energy. Thus, the correct answer is:

**Answer: C**
