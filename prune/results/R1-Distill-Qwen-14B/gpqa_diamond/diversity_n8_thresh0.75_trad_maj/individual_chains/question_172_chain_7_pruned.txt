Okay, so I've got this question about stars and their photospheres. Hmm, the question says that iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to star_2. And there's an energy difference given between the energy levels, which is 1.38e-23 J. Oh, and the photospheres are in LTE, which I think stands for Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium. 

Wait, I remember that in LTE, the distribution of particles among energy levels is described by the Boltzmann distribution. The Boltzmann factor tells us the ratio of the number of particles in two energy levels. Right, the formula is something like (n_upper / n_lower) = (g_upper / g_lower) * exp(-ΔE/(k*T)), where ΔE is the energy difference, k is Boltzmann's constant, and T is the temperature.

So in this problem, star_1 has twice as excited iron atoms as star_2. Wait, which way is higher? Oh, wait, the question says the iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited. So if we consider two energy levels, say level 1 and level 2, and assuming that the higher energy level is the excited state, then n1_upper / n1_lower = 2 compared to n2_upper / n2_lower. Or wait, maybe I should think in terms of the ratio between the two stars. 

Wait, the question says that in star_1, the iron atoms are twice as excited. So maybe the number of atoms in the higher energy level in star_1 is twice that in star_2. Or perhaps the ratio of the excited state to the ground state
