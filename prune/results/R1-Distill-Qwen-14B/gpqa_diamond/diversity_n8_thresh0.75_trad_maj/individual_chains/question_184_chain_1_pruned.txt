Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to work through it step by step. The question is about synthesizing a specific compound starting from benzene. The target molecule is 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene. Hmm, that's a mouthful. Let me break it down.

First, I'll draw the structure. Benzene ring with substituents. The numbering might be tricky, but let's see. The positions are 1, 2, and 3. So position 1 has an ethoxy group, position 2 has a tert-butyl group, and position 3 has a nitro group. Wait, no—wait, the way the name is written is 2-(tert-butyl), 1-ethoxy, 3-nitro. So positions are 1, 2, 3 in order. So benzene ring with substituents at positions 1 (ethoxy), 2 (tert-butyl), and 3 (nitro). Wait, no, benzene is a ring, so the numbering should be such that substituents get the lowest possible numbers. But I'm not sure about the exact numbering here. Maybe it's easier to think about the substituent positions as 1,2,3 in a way that's possible without making any two substituents adjacent.

Wait, another approach: the target molecule is 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene. So substituents are on carbons 1, 2, and 3. So they are adjacent, but in a meta arrangement? No, wait, 1, 2, 3 are consecutive. So it's a tri-substituted benzene with substituents at 1, 2, and 3. Let me visualize that. So the ring has a substituent every other carbon—so maybe it's in a 1,2,3 arrangement, which would make them adjacent in a way that's possible.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit stuck on the numbering. Maybe I should think about how to add the groups one by one. Benzene can undergo electrophilic substitution. The order in which substituents are added will affect the positions where new groups attach.

The target has three substituents: tert-butyl, ethoxy, and nitro groups. Let's think about directing effects:
