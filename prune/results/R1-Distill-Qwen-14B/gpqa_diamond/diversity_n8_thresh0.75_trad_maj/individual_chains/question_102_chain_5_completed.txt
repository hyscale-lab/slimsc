Okay, so I'm trying to figure out why the green signal isn't showing up in the mouse model. Let me start by going through the setup.

So, the experiment involves a ligand-receptor pair expressed in neural crest cells. The ligand is a coiled-coil of two alpha helices, and the receptor is a monomeric transmembrane protein with eight alpha helices, four extracellular, and three beta sheets. They're using a bicistronic lox-Cre vector. 

The vector setup is a bit complex. The ligand's ORF is at the 5' position, fused to mCherry. Then there's a stop cassette (loxP-stop-loxP) between the ligand and mCherry. The receptor is at the 3' position, fused to eGFP, and there's another stop cassette (lox2272-stop-lox2272) between the receptor and eGFP. 

The ligand is under the CBA promoter, and the receptor is after an IRES element. So, the ligand is driven by CBA, and the receptor might be under a different promoter, perhaps the IRES? Or is the IRES regulating something else? Wait, bicistronic vectors use IRES elements to allow internal ribosome entry, so each gene can be translated from the same promoter. So, the CBA promoter drives both the ligand and the receptor, but the receptor is after an IRES, meaning it's a separate transcript but same mRNA.

They transfected the plasmid into primary astrocyte culture. The Western blot shows signals proportional to actin, so the expression is being checked. Then they made a mouse model homozygous for the construct in a wild-type background. Crossed with SOX10-Cre mice. Cre is used for recombination. The loxP and lox2272 sites are different; loxP is the original, and lox2272 is a variant that doesn't recombine with loxP. 

Wait, how does the Cre work here? SOX10-Cre would express Cre under the control of SOX10, which is active in neural crest cells. So, the Cre would recombine the lox sites in the construct. 

In the vector, the ligand is at 5', followed by loxP-stop-loxP, then mCherry. The receptor is at 3', after the IRES, followed by lox2272-stop-lox2272, then eGFP. 

So, when Cre is introduced, it should delete the stop cassettes. But wait, how? Let me think: loxP sites are recognized by Cre. If a loxP is upstream of the stop and another loxP downstream, Cre would cut them and remove the stop cassette, allowing expression. Similarly with lox2272. But wait, lox2272 is a mutant that can't recombine with loxP. So, when SOX10-Cre is active in neural crest cells, it would recognize the loxP sites but not the lox2272. 

So, in the vector, the ligand is first. Let's say the vector is ligand (CBA promoter) -> loxP-stop-loxP -> mCherry. Then, after IRES, the receptor ORF -> lox2272-stop-lox2272 -> eGFP.

When Cre is active, it would recombine the loxP sites. So, the first stop cassette (loxP on both ends) would be cut and removed, allowing the ligand and mCherry to be expressed. Similarly, the second part has lox2272, which Cre can't recognize because it's a different site. So, the receptor would have the stop cassette still in place unless another Cre variant is used. But in this setup, I think the lox2272 is a different system, perhaps for another type of recombination, like Dre.

Wait, maybe I'm a bit confused. Because lox2272 is a site that doesn't recombine with Cre, so Cre won't affect it. So, in this vector, only the loxP sites would be cut by Cre. So, when the Cre is expressed (like in SOX10-Cre mice), the loxP sites are cut, removing the stop cassettes. 

In the ligand's case, the stop is between ligand and mCherry. So, if loxP is cut, the stop is removed, so ligand and mCherry are co-expressed. Similarly, the receptor would have its own stop cassette, but if it's lox2272, then Cre can't cut that, so the stop remains. Hmm, but wait, in the vector, the receptor ORF is followed by lox2272-stop-lox2272 and eGFP. So, when Cre doesn't cut those, the stop remains. So, the receptor would be expressed as a separate ORF, but only if Cre removes the stop between the ligand and mCherry. 

Wait, perhaps I need to think about how the bicistronic vector works. The vector has two ORFs: ligand and receptor. The ligand is first, then stop (with loxP), then mCherry. The receptor is after an IRES, so same mRNA but different ORF. Then, another stop with lox2272, then eGFP.

So, when Cre is introduced, it would only remove the loxP stops. So, in the presence of Cre, the ligand's stop is removed, so ligand is expressed along with mCherry. But the receptor's stop is in lox2272, which Cre can't cut, so the receptor and eGFP are not expressed. Wait, that can't be right. Because the IRES would allow the receptor to be expressed as a separate ORF. 

Wait, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Let me try again. The vector is a bicistronic vector, meaning two genes are in one mRNA. The first gene is ligand, under CBA promoter. After that, there's a stop cassette (loxP-stop-loxP), then mCherry. Then, an IRES, then receptor ORF, then another stop (lox2272), then eGFP.

So, when Cre is present, it would cut the loxP sites, removing the stop between ligand and mCherry. So, ligand and mCherry are co-expressed. But the receptor's stop is a lox2272, which Cre can't cut, so the stop remains. So, the receptor would not be expressed. Or does the IRES allow the receptor to be expressed regardless of the stop?

Wait, the IRES allows the translation of the second ORF without the stop in between. So, in the absence of Cre, the ligand and mCherry are separated by a stop, so mCherry would not be expressed. The receptor would have its own stop after it, so eGFP would not be expressed. 

But when Cre is present, it cuts the loxP sites, removing the stop between ligand and mCherry. So, ligand and mCherry are co-expressed. The receptor would have the lox2272 stop, which Cre doesn't cut, so the stop remainsâ€”so the receptor would be expressed. Wait, but the stop is after the receptor, so the eGFP would not be expressed unless the stop is removed. Oh, wait, the vector is set up so that the receptor is followed by a stop (lox2272), then eGFP. So, without the stop being removed, the receptor would be expressed, but not eGFP.

But in this setup, the construct is in a mouse model. The mice are homozygous for the construct. Then they're crossed with SOX10-Cre mice. So, in the offspring, the Cre would act on the construct in neural crest cells. 

Wait, but the question says that when they visualize the offspring under a confocal, there's no green signal. The eGFP is fused to the receptor. So, the green signal would indicate that the receptor-eGFP is being expressed and likely on the cell surface.

So, why isn't the green signal showing up? Let's look at the options.

Option A: ligand and receptor are in a paracrine relationship. Paracrine means they act on nearby cells. But the question is about the expression of the receptor-eGFP. If it's paracrine, that wouldn't affect the expression level. So probably not A.

Option B: receptor-eGFP is stuck in the Golgi. If the protein isn't properly trafficked, it wouldn't be on the cell surface. But why would this happen? Unless the construct has a problem. Maybe the eGFP is in the wrong frame, causing a premature stop codon.

Option C: enhancer missing. The CBA promoter is a strong promoter, so it's probably sufficient. But if the enhancer is missing, the promoter might not be active. But the ligand is under CBA, and the receptor is after IRES. If the enhancer is missing, neither would be expressed. But in the Western blot, when they transfected into astrocytes, they saw signals proportional to actin. So perhaps the expression is working when transiently transfected, but in the mouse model, maybe the enhancer isn't present. Hmm, but the mouse construct is in a bicistronic vector, so I think the promoters are provided. Maybe the problem is elsewhere.

Option D: receptor and eGFP not in frame. The vector has the receptor ORF followed by a stop and eGFP. If the stop is not properly removed, the eGFP may not be expressed. But wait, the stop after the receptor is lox2272, which Cre can't cut. So, in the mouse model, which is homozygous for the construct, unless they have another recombinase, that stop remains. So the eGFP wouldn't be expressed. Wait, but the mouse is crossed with SOX10-Cre, which should delete the loxP sites but not the lox2272. 

Wait, the initial vector has the ligand with loxP stop, which Cre would remove, allowing mCherry to be expressed. The receptor has a lox2272 stop, which Cre can't cut, so eGFP remains behind. So the eGFP wouldn't be expressed, meaning no green signal. But why would the eGFP not be expressed?

Wait, but the reverse could be possible. Maybe the eGFP is in the same ORF as the receptor if the stop is not there. Or perhaps the stop is preventing expression.

Wait, no. The vector is set up as ligand, then stop (loxP), then mCherry. Then IRES, then receptor, then stop (lox2272), then eGFP. So, in the presence of Cre, the ligand and mCherry are co-expressed. The receptor would be expressed because the IRES allows its own translation, but the stop after the receptor (lox2272) remains, so eGFP is not expressed. So the eGFP wouldn't be made. So why would the receptor not be expressed?

Wait, if the stop is after the receptor, but the eGFP is after that, then the receptor is expressed, but eGFP is not. So, the eGFP might not be expressed. But in the problem, the eGFP is fused to the receptor. So, the eGFP should be at the C-terminus of the receptor. So, the construct would be receptor-eGFP. Therefore, the eGFP is part of the same ORF as the receptor. Or is it separate?

Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the setup. The way the question describes the vector is: the receptor ORF is at the 3' position, fused to eGFP at the C-terminus. So, the receptor is followed directly by eGFP without a stop, meaning they are in the same ORF. Then, after that, there is a stop cassette.

Wait, that's a different interpretation. Let me read it again.

The receptor ORF is at the 3' and fused to the eGFP at the C-terminus. So, the receptor is at the N-terminus, and eGFP is at the C-terminus of the same ORF. So, it's receptor-eGFP as a single ORF. Then, after that, there's a stop cassette (lox2272), but that's after the eGFP.

Wait, that doesn't make sense. Because if the ORF is receptor-eGFP, then the stop is after eGFP. So, in that case, without the stop being cut, the eGFP would be expressed as part of the same protein as the receptor.

Wait, perhaps the vector is set up such that the ligand is first, followed by a stop (loxP) and then mCherry. Then, IRES, then the receptor-eGFP as a single ORF, followed by a stop (lox2272). 

So, in the presence of Cre, the loxP stop is removed, so ligand and mCherry are expressed. The receptor-eGFP is in a separate ORF after IRES. But the stop after it is lox2272, which Cre can't cut. So, the receptor-eGFP would be expressed as a single protein, and eGFP should fluoresce.

But the question states that no green signal is observed. So, why isn't eGFP expressed?

Let me think about the possibilities. If the stop after the receptor-eGFP is lox2272, which Cre can't remove, then the eGFP would not be expressed because the stop remains. But wait, the eGFP is part of the same ORF as the receptor. So, in this case, the presence of the stop after eGFP wouldn't prevent the expression of receptor-eGFP. Because the ORF is receptor-eGFP, so it's a single protein. The stop after that is for the vector's purposes, perhaps.

Alternatively, maybe the eGFP is in a separate ORF, but the stop is preventing its expression.

But in the question, the ligand and receptor are initially expressed in neural crest cells. The Cre is SOX10-Cre, which is active in neural crest derivatives, like Schwann cells and other lineages. So, in the offspring, the Cre would have recombined the loxP sites, but not the lox2272.

So, in the construct, the ligand would be expressed (because the loxP stop is removed), but the receptor-eGFP would also be expressed because the IRES allows its translation. But the stop after receptor-eGFP is lox2272, which Cre can't cut, but that's just a stop. So, the receptor-eGFP should be expressed.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that the eGFP is after a stop, so it's not expressed. Or maybe the vector is set up so that the receptor and eGFP are under the control of the same stop cassette. 

Alternatively, perhaps the eGFP is not in frame. If the stop is present after the receptor, but the eGFP is in the same ORF, then the stop wouldn't affect it. Unless the eGFP is in a separate ORF. 

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think about the vector structure again.

The vector is bicistronic, so two ORFs in the same mRNA. The first is ligand, under CBA promoter. Then a stop cassette (loxP). Then mCherry. Then, an IRES, then the receptor ORF, which is fused to eGFP at the C-terminus. Then another stop cassette (lox2272).

So, the first ORF is ligand, which is followed by a stop. When Cre is present, the loxP sites are cut, so the stop is removed, allowing mCherry to be expressed in the same transcript. The second ORF is the receptor, which is after IRES. The receptor is followed by a stop (lox2272), then eGFP. 

Wait, no. The way the question describes it: the receptor ORF is at the 3' position, fused to eGFP. So, the receptor and eGFP are part of the same ORF. Then, after that, there's a stop cassette. 

So, the vector is ligand -> stop (loxP) -> mCherry; IRES; receptor-eGFP -> stop (lox2272).

In the presence of Cre, the loxP stop is removed, so ligand and mCherry are co-expressed. The receptor-eGFP is in the same ORF, so it's expressed as a single protein. The stop after it is lox2272, which Cre can't cut, so that stop remains. But that stop is after the ORF, so it shouldn't affect expression of receptor-eGFP. 

Wait, but the stop is part of the vector. So, the mRNA would have, after receptor-eGFP, a stop codon, followed by lox2272. But the presence of a stop codon in the mRNA would terminate translation at that point. So, receptor-eGFP would be translated until the stop, and eGFP would be part of that. 

Wait, but if the stop is after eGFP, then the ORF would be: receptor -> eGFP -> stop. So, the entire receptor-eGFP would be translated as a single protein. So, the eGFP would be at the end, and the stop would terminate after that. So, the eGFP should be expressed. 

But in the experiment, the green signal isn't observed. So, why?

Looking at the options again:

Option D: the receptor and eGFP are not in frame. That would prevent proper expression. Like, if the frame is wrong, the eGFP wouldn't be correctly expressed, leading to no signal. But in that case, the Western blot would show the receptor but not eGFP? Or perhaps a truncated protein.

Wait, but in the Western blot, when they transfected the plasmid into astrocytes, they used antibodies against the overexpressed proteins. So, they should have detected if the proteins were expressed. But the result of the Western isn't given, but the problem says the signals are proportional to actin, which suggests that the blot is working.

Wait, but the mouse model is homozygous, and they crossed it into SOX10-Cre. So, perhaps in the mouse, Cre is not active, so the stops are not removed. But the mouse is homozygous for the construct, which should have the lox sites. But SOX10-Cre is supposed to activate in neural crest cells.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is that the IRES isn't working, so the receptor isn't being expressed. But that would affect both eGFP and receptor.

Wait, but the eGFP is at the C-terminus of the receptor, so if the IRES is not working, neither would be expressed.

Alternatively, perhaps the stop cassette after the receptor is not lox2272 but something else. Wait, no, the question says it's lox2272.

Wait, another possibility: the lox2272 stop cassette is preventing the expression of the receptor-eGFP. Because when the Cre is active, it only cuts loxP sites. The lox2272 is a different site. So, the stop between receptor-eGFP and eGFP (if any) isn't relevant. Wait, no, because the eGFP is part of the same ORF.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting the vector wrong. Let me re-express it:

The vector has:

CBA promoter -> ligand ORF -> loxP-stop-loxP -> mCherry -> IRES -> receptor ORF -> lox2272-stop-lox2272 -> eGFP.

So, when Cre is present, it removes the loxP-stop-loxP between ligand and mCherry. So, ligand and mCherry are co-expressed. The receptor ORF is after the IRES, and its stop is lox2272, which Cre doesn't cut. So, the stop remains, preventing eGFP from being expressed. Wait, but eGFP is after the stop? Or is the stop after the receptor?

Ah, perhaps the vector is designed such that the receptor is expressed as a separate ORF, with its own stop. So, in the presence of Cre, the ligand and mCherry are expressed, but the receptor is not because its stop isn't removed. But in that case, the eGFP wouldn't be expressed either.

Wait, but the eGFP is part of the same construct as the receptor. So, if the stop is between the receptor and eGFP, then the stop would prevent eGFP from being expressed. So, the receptor would be expressed, but eGFP would not. But in the question, the eGFP is fused to the receptor. So, in that case, the eGFP is at the end of the receptor ORF.

Wait, maybe the eGFP is in the same ORF, so the stop after it wouldn't matter. So, the eGFP would be expressed as part of the receptor-eGFP fusion. Therefore, the green signal should be present.

But why isn't it present? 

Looking at the options again:

Option C says the enhancer for the ligand and receptor expression is missing. But the ligand is under CBA promoter, which is a strong promoter, and the receptor is after IRES. So, maybe in the mouse, the expression isn't happening, but the Western showed expression in astrocytes. So perhaps the issue is elsewhere.

Option D: the receptor and eGFP are not in frame. If the ORF after the IRES is not correctly in frame, the eGFP wouldn't be expressed. So, the fusion protein would be incorrectly made, leading to no eGFP signal. 

But why would they not be in frame? Because the vector's construction might have caused a frame shift. For example, if the stop cassette introduces an incorrect reading frame, then the eGFP would not be properly expressed. So, in this case, the receptor-eGFP would be a fusion protein, but if the frame is wrong, the eGFP may not be expressed, leading to no green signal.

Alternatively, perhaps the stop between the receptor and eGFP (lox2272) isn't cut, so the eGFP isn't expressed. But earlier I thought the stop is after eGFP, so the receptor-eGFP would be translated correctly.

Wait, maybe the stop is between receptor and eGFP, so the eGFP is in a separate ORF. But if that's the case, the stop would prevent eGFP expression. But the question says the eGFP is fused to the receptor, implying same ORF.

Alternatively, perhaps the presence of the stop in the lox2272 cassette after the receptor-eGFP ORF is causing a problem. But in that case, the stop is after the ORF, so it shouldn't affect translation of the receptor-eGFP.

Wait, perhaps the issue is that the lox2272 stop isn't removed, so the eGFP isn't expressed. But if the eGFP is part of the same ORF, then the stop after wouldn't matter.

Alternatively, perhaps the expression vector isn't correctly designed. For example, the IRES may not function, so the receptor isn't expressed. But that would affect the ligand as well. 

Wait, but the ligand is under CBA promoter, which is a strong constitutive promoter. The receptor is after IRES, which would allow it to be expressed as a separate ORF. So, if the IRES isn't working, the receptor and eGFP wouldn't be expressed. But then the ligand would be expressed, and mCherry as well (if the stop is removed). But in the mouse, since the Cre is active, the ligand and mCherry would be expressed, but the receptor and eGFP wouldn't. 

But in the question, the mouse is crossed with SOX10-Cre, so the Cre should have activated the loxP sites, leading to the removal of the ligand's stop. So, ligand and mCherry are expressed. The receptor's stop isn't removed, so receptor and eGFP may not be expressed. 

Wait, no. If the stop after the receptor is lox2272, then Cre can't remove it. So, the receptor and eGFP would be expressed only if the stop is removed. But without the stop being removed, the receptor and eGFP would not be expressed. 

Wait, but the IRES allows for internal ribosome entry, so the receptor should be expressed regardless of the stop. Because the stop is after the receptor-eGFP ORF, which is separate from the ligand. 

Hmm, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think about the possible reasons for no green signal.

The most likely reason is that the eGFP isn't being expressed. That could be due to a stop cassette preventing its expression. If the stop isn't removed, the eGFP isn't expressed. But why would the stop not be removed? Because the lox sites are different. So, if the stop for the receptor-eGFP is in a lox2272 cassette, and the Cre can't cut that, the stop remains. So, the eGFP isn't expressed. 

But wait, the eGFP is part of the same ORF as the receptor. So, the presence of a stop after eGFP wouldn't prevent the expression of the receptor-eGFP. The stop would just terminate the ORF after eGFP, which is fine because the protein is already made. So, the eGFP should fluoresce. 

Hmm, maybe I'm missing something. Alternatively, perhaps the stop is within the eGFP ORF. For example, if the stop is placed in the middle of eGFP's coding sequence, then the eGFP wouldn't be expressed. But that would require the vector design to have the stop within eGFP, which isn't indicated here.

Wait, another angle: if the IRES isn't functioning, the receptor and eGFP wouldn't be expressed. But IRES elements usually allow for the expression of a second ORF without the need for a stop codon. So, the presence of the IRES would mean the receptor is expressed regardless of the stop. 

Alternatively, perhaps the vector isn't correctly spliced, and the IRES isn't functional. So, the receptor and eGFP aren't expressed.

But then why would the Western blot show expression in the astrocytes? Because when the plasmid is transfected, maybe the IRES is functional in culture, but not in the mouse. Or vice versa.

Alternatively, perhaps the expression of the eGFP is dependent on the correct reading frame. If the stop after the receptor isn't removed, the eGFP might not be in frame, leading to no expression. For example, the stop would introduce a premature stop codon in the eGFP ORF, causing the eGFP to not be expressed.

Wait, perhaps the lox2272-stop-lox2272 cassette is inserted in such a way that it disrupts the eGFP ORF. So, when the Cre doesn't remove it, the eGFP isn't expressed. But the question states that the stop is between the receptor and eGFP. So, the eGFP's ORF is after the stop. So, if the stop isn't removed, the eGFP isn't expressed.

But in that case, the eGFP wouldn't be expressed, leading to no green signal. So, why would the stop not be removed? Because the lox sites are lox2272, which Cre can't cut. So, the stop remains, and eGFP isn't expressed.

Therefore, the reason for no green signal is that the stop after the receptor isn't removed because the lox sites are lox2272, which Cre can't cut. So, the eGFP isn't expressed. 

Looking back at the options, option C is about enhancer missing. But the CBA promoter doesn't require enhancers. Option D is about the frame being wrong. 

Wait, but the vector design may have caused the eGFP to be out of frame. If the ORF after the IRES has a frame shift due to the stop cassette, the eGFP might not be expressed. 

Alternatively, if the eGFP is in a separate ORF, and the stop isn't removed, it wouldn't be expressed. 

Wait, the vector has the receptor ORF followed by a stop and eGFP. So, if the stop is present, the eGFP isn't expressed. But in the presence of Cre, only the loxP sites are cut, so the eGFP stop remains. So, the eGFP isn't expressed, leading to no green signal.

Therefore, the most likely reason is that the stop cassette for eGFP isn't removed because Cre can't cut lox2272. So, the eGFP isn't expressed.

Looking at the options, option C says the enhancer is missing, which I don't think is the case. Option D says the frame is wrong. Alternatively, the stop between receptor and eGFP is preventing eGFP expression.

Wait, another angle: perhaps the IRES is not working, so the receptor isn't expressed. But in that case, the eGFP wouldn't be expressed either, but the Western blot would show no receptor expression. But in the question, the Western blot is done and the signals are proportional to actin, so perhaps the expression is working when transfected. But in the mouse, perhaps the expression isn't happening.

Wait, but the way the vector is designed, the ligand and mCherry are co-expressed when Cre is present, and the receptor and eGFP are expressed only if the lox2272 stop is removed. But since Cre can't remove lox2272, the receptor and eGFP are not expressed.

Wait, but the question states that the vector is bicistronic and that the ligand is at 5', the receptor at 3'. The IRES is upstream of the receptor.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Maybe the IRES is between the ligand and receptor. So, the same mRNA has ligand, then IRES, then receptor. Then, after the receptor, the stop is lox2272, then eGFP.

In this case, the ligand is expressed from the CBA promoter, and the receptor is expressed via IRES. The stop after the receptor is lox2272, which Cre can't remove. So, receptor and eGFP aren't expressed because the stop remains.

Wait, but the eGFP is after the receptor. So, the ORF is receptor-eGFP? Or is it separate?

I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think about the options again.

Option D: receptor and eGFP not in frame. So, if the ORF after the IRES isn't correct, the eGFP isn't expressed. How would that happen? Perhaps the stop cassette introduces an incorrect reading frame, causing the eGFP to not be in frame, leading to no expression.

Alternatively, perhaps the eGFP is in a separate ORF, and the stop isn't removed, so it isn't expressed.

I think the most plausible answer is D: the receptor and eGFP are not in frame. Because if the stop cassette introduces a frameshift, the eGFP would not be expressed correctly, leading to no green signal.

Alternatively, the stop after the receptor-eGFP ORF isn't the issue, because the stop is after the ORF. So, the eGFP would be expressed.

Wait, but the presence of a stop codon in the mRNA would terminate translation. So, if the stop is present between receptor and eGFP, the eGFP isn't expressed. But if the stop is after eGFP, the entire receptor-eGFP is expressed.

Hmm, I'm not entirely certain, but based on the options, I think the correct answer is D. Because if the eGFP isn't in frame, it won't fluoresce.


The question involves a bicistronic lox-Cre vector expressing a ligand and receptor pair in neural crest cells. The vector is structured as follows: the ligand is under the CBA promoter, followed by a loxP-stop-loxP cassette and mCherry. The receptor, fused to eGFP at the C-terminus, is positioned after an IRES element and a lox2272-stop-lox2272 cassette. The experiment uses SOX10-Cre mice to recombine the loxP sites, but no green signal (eGFP) is observed in the offspring under confocal microscopy.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Vector Design and Cre Activity**:
   - SOX10-Cre specifically targets loxP sites but cannot recognize lox2272. Thus, the loxP-stop-loxP cassette between the ligand and mCherry is removed, allowing co-expression of the ligand and mCherry.
   - The lox2272-stop-lox2272 cassette between the receptor and eGFP remains intact, preventing eGFP expression unless a different recombinase (e.g., Dre) is used.

2. **Expression of Receptor-eGFP**:
   - The receptor is expressed as a single ORF fused to eGFP. The stop cassette after eGFP would terminate translation, but this should not prevent the expression of the receptor-eGFP fusion protein as a single entity.
   - The absence of a green signal suggests that eGFP is not being expressed or detected.

3. **Critical Evaluation of Options**:
   - **(A) Ligand and receptor are in a paracrine relationship**: This does not explain the lack of eGFP expression, as paracrine signaling relates to function, not expression levels.
   - **(B) The receptor-eGFP construct is stuck in the Golgi**: This is unlikely, as the issue would likely result in improper trafficking but not a complete absence of expression.
   - **(C) The enhancer for the ligand and receptor expression is missing**: The CBA promoter is a strong constitutive promoter, so the absence of an enhancer is unlikely to prevent expression.
   - **(D) The receptor and eGFP are not in frame**: If the vector construction introduced a frameshift or misalignment between the receptor and eGFP ORFs, eGFP would not be expressed correctly, leading to the observed lack of fluorescence.

### Conclusion:
The most plausible explanation is that the receptor and eGFP are not in frame, resulting in improper expression of eGFP and the absence of a green signal. This aligns with the observation that eGFP is not fluorescing despite the presence of Cre recombinase and the expected expression of the receptor.

**Answer: D**
