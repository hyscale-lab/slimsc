Okay, so I've got this science multiple-choice question here, and I need to figure out the answer. Let me read it again.

The question is asking which of the given particles is not associated with a spontaneously-broken symmetry. The options are Phonon, Skyrmion, Magnon, and Pion.

Hmm. I remember that symmetry breaking is a big concept in particle physics and condensed matter physics. When a system has a symmetry that isn't apparent in its ground state, it's said to have spontaneously broken symmetry. The particles that arise from such a situation are called Goldstone bosons. Oh right, Goldstone's theorem states that for every broken continuous symmetry, there's a corresponding massless boson.

Wait, so let me think about each option. 

Option A: Phonon. Phonons are quantized sound waves in a crystal lattice. They arise from the quantization of the vibrations in the crystal. I think that phonons are related to the breaking of translational symmetry. Wait, no, the translational symmetry is still present in the lattice. Oh, maybe it's more about the rotational symmetry or something else. Or perhaps phonons emerge from a symmetry that's not spontaneously broken. Wait, maybe phonons are from the breaking of the symmetry in the crystal when it's in a disordered state, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, phonons are related to the lattice vibrations and are considered as quasi-particles in solids, but I'm not certain if they're linked to spontaneous symmetry breaking.

Option B: Skyrmion. Skyrmions are topological solitons in certain magnetic materials. They are solutions to the equations of motion in a system with a broken symmetry. I think they arise in systems where the pion field symmetry is broken. Oh, right! Skyrmions are associated with the spontaneous symmetry breaking in chiral symmetry, so they are linked to broken symmetry.

Option C: Magnon. Magnons are the quasiparticles representing spin waves in magnetic materials. They are analogous to phonons but for magnetic moments. I remember that the NÃ©el state in antiferromagnets breaks the rotational symmetry. So the magnon arises from the Goldstone mode of that broken symmetry. So magnons are associated with spontaneously broken symmetry.

Option D: Pion. Pions are the lightest particles in the Standard Model, and they are pseudogoldstone bosons. They arise from the spontaneous symmetry breaking of the chiral symmetry in QCD (Quantum Chromodynamics). The chiral symmetry is broken at low energies, and the pions are the corresponding Goldstone bosons, but they gain a small mass due to the breaking of the axial U(1) symmetry (the "pion mass" comes from electromagnetic interactions, I think). So pions are definitely linked to spontaneous symmetry breaking.

So, putting it all together: Skyrmions (B), Magnons (C), and Pions (D) are all connected with spontaneously broken symmetries. That leaves Phonons (A) as the possible answer. Wait, but are phonons linked to a broken symmetry?

Phonons arise from the quantization of lattice vibrations. The original symmetry in the crystal is translational symmetry, but in a perfect crystal, translational symmetry is unbroken. So phonons are more about the vibrations in a system with unbroken symmetry. Or wait, perhaps in the case of a solid, when the material is in a disordered state, like a liquid, but that's not relevant here. Alternatively, when
