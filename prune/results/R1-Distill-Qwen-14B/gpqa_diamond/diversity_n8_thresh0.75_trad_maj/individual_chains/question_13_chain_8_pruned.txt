Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of these reaction mechanisms. But I'll try to break it down step by step.

The starting material is (R)-(+)-Limonene in a methanol solution. I remember that limonene is a cyclic monoterpene, specifically a bicyclic monoterpene. The structure I recall is a bicyclic compound, maybe something like a bicyclo structure with a double bond. Wait, limonene has a specific structureâ€”like a cyclohexene ring with a substituent. Oh right, the structure is menth-1-en-5-ol? No, wait, limonene is actually a bicyclic monoterpene. Oh, right! It's a bicyclo[2.2.1]heptene structure. The (R) configuration means it's the enantiomer of the other form, but I'm not sure how that affects the reaction yet.

The first step is hydrogenation using Pd/C under hydrogen. So, the limonene is probably undergoing hydrogenation. Since limonene has a double bond, adding hydrogen would hydrogenate it. But wait, limonene has a specific double bond. Let me think: limonene has a structure where the double bond is between carbons 1 and 2, making it a bicyclo ring with a double bond. So, hydrogenation would add H2 across that double bond, converting it into a single bond. So, the product after hydrogenation (product 1) would be the hydrogenated limonene, which I think is called dihydrolimonene. The stereochemistry might change because the double bond is saturated, but since the starting material is a single stereoisomer (R configuration), the product would have a certain stereochemistry.

Wait, wait. Actually, limonene is a cyclic monoterpene with a structure that's more accurately described. Let's get the structure right. Limonene is a bicyclo[2.2.1]hept-2-ene. So, it's a norbornene structure. The (R) configuration refers to the arrangement around the bridgehead carbons. When hydrogen is added to the double bond, the bridgehead carbons (probably carbons 1 and 2) will each get two hydrogens, or maybe one each? Wait, no, each gets one hydrogen, because the double bond is between two carbons. So, the hydrogenation would add two hydrogens across the double bond. So in product 1, which is the hydrogenated lim
