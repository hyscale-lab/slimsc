Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here about enthalpy of neutralization. Hmm, I need to calculate it when these three solutions are mixed together. Let me think about how to approach this.

The solutions involved are HCl, H2SO4, and Ba(OH)2. Oh wait, enthalpy of neutralization is usually about the heat released when an acid reacts with a base. But here there are three solutions. Oh right, when you mix an acid and a base, they neutralize each other. But the problem is, how do these three react when mixed?

Wait, HCl is a strong acid and H2SO4 is also a strong acid, but Ba(OH)2 is a strong base. So when you mix them, the acids will react with the base. But wait, Ba(OH)2 is a strong base, so it will dissociate completely. HCl and H2SO4 are strong acids too, so they'll dissociate as well.

Wait, but wait, H2SO4 is a diprotic acid, but in strong acid conditions, it might dissociate completely. Wait, in water, the first dissociation is complete, but the second is not. But for the purpose of neutralization, I think we consider both H+ ions from H2SO4.

Wait, but I'm trying to find the neutralization reaction here. So when you mix the three, the acids (HCl and H2SO4) will donate H+ ions, and the base (Ba(OH)2) will provide OH- ions. The neutralization reaction would produce water and maybe some salt.

But wait, Ba(OH)2 reacts with H2SO4 to form BaSO4 and water. Oh, because Ba^2+ and SO4^2- combine to make BaSO4, which is a precipitate. Hmm, that might affect the calculation because not all the acid would react if the base is in limited quantity.

Wait, let me break down the problem. First, I need to find the moles of H+ from each acid and the moles of OH- from the base.

HCl is a strong acid, so each mole gives one H+. So moles of HCl = Molarity * Volume (in liters). HCl is 0.2 M, 500 mL is 0.5 L. So moles HCl = 0.2 * 0.5 = 0.1 moles. So H+ from HCl is 0.1 moles.

H2SO4 is a diprotic acid. In solution, it dissociates completely into 2 H+ and SO4^2- (I think for the first dissociation, yes, then the second is not so complete, but in strong acid conditions, it does). So each mole of H2SO4 gives 2 H+. The volume is 300 mL = 0.3 L, and concentration is 0.3 M. So moles H2SO4 = 0.3 * 0.3 = 0.09 moles. So H+ from H2SO4 is 0.09 * 2 = 0.18 moles.

Total H+ from both acids: 0.1 + 0.18 = 0.28 moles.

Now, the base is Ba(OH)2. Each mole of Ba(OH)2 gives 2 OH- ions. So moles Ba(OH)2 = 0.5 M * 0.2 L = 0.1 moles. Wait, no wait: Ba(OH)2 is 0.5 M, volume is 200 mL, which is 0.2 L. So moles Ba(OH)2 = 0.5 * 0.2 = 0.1 moles. Each gives 2 OH-, so moles OH- = 0.1 * 2 = 0.2 moles.

Wait, so the neutralization reaction is H+ + OH- → H2O. The enthalpy of neutralization is usually per mole of H+ (or OH-) reacting. But wait, the standard enthalpy of neutralization is for one mole of H+ reacting with one mole of OH-.

In this case, the acids provide a total of 0.28 moles of H+, and the base provides 0.2 moles of OH-. So OH- is the limiting reactant here. So all 0.2 moles of OH- will react, and 0.28 - 0.2 = 0.08 moles of H+ will remain.

Wait, but then, the excess H+ will come from which acid? Let me think. HCl is a strong acid, so it's all dissociated. H2SO4 is a diprotic acid, but only the first H+ is fully dissociated. Wait, no, in the initial solution, H2SO4 would dissociate into 2 H+ and SO4^2-? Or does the second H+ not dissociate completely?

Wait, I'm a bit confused here. For H2SO4, the first dissociation is complete: H2SO4 → 2H+ + SO4^2-? No, wait. Actually, the first dissociation is complete: H2SO4 → 2H+ + SO4^2- is not correct. Wait, no, the first dissociation is H2SO4 → 2H+ + SO4^2- is incorrect. Let me think again. When H2SO4 is in water, the first dissociation is complete: H2SO4 → 2H+ + SO4^2-? Or is it H2SO4 → H+ + HSO4- (and then HSO4- dissociates further into H+ and SO4^2-, but only partially)?

Ah, right, the first dissociation is complete: H2SO4 → 2H+ + SO4^2-? No, wait, wait. No, wait. Sulfuric acid is a strong acid for the first dissociation step. So H2SO4 → 2H+ + SO4^2- is not correct. Actually, in the first step, it dissociates completely into H+ and HSO4^- (but wait, that's not correct either). Wait, no, the first dissociation is complete: H2SO4 → 2H+ + SO4^2-.

Wait, no, wait. I'm getting this wrong. Let me recall: H2SO4 is a diprotic acid. First, it dissociates completely into 2 H+ and SO4^2-? No, wait, no. Wait, the first dissociation is complete: H2SO4 → 2H+ + SO4^2-? No, that's not right. Because sulfuric acid is a strong acid in the first step, meaning it dissociates completely. The first H+ is released completely, but the second is only partially. Wait, no, perhaps the first dissociation is complete, but the second is not. Let me think again.

Wait, when H2SO4 is dissolved in water, it dissociates completely into H+ and HSO4^- as the first step. Then, HSO4^- is a weak acid and only partially dissociates into H+ and SO4^2-. So the first H+ is fully dissociated, the second is not. So in total, each mole of H2SO4 gives 2 moles of H+ because the first is complete (so 1 H+) and the second is half dissociated (so another 1 H+ on average). Hmm, but wait, in the case of strong acids, like H2SO4, the first H+ is strong, but the second is weak. So when we calculate the H+ concentration, for a solution of H2SO4, it's 2 times the concentration because each H2SO4 gives two H+? Or is it 1.01 times?

Wait, this is getting a bit complicated, but perhaps for the purpose of this problem, we can assume that H2SO4 completely dissociates into 2 H+ ions. Because the problem says H2SO4 is 0.3 M, so the H+ concentration would be 0.6 M. So each mole of H2SO4 gives 2 moles of H+.

So in our calculation, HCl gives 0.1 moles of H+, H2SO4 gives 0.18 moles of H+ (since 0.09 moles * 2). So total H+ is 0.28 moles.

And the base, Ba(OH)2, gives 0.2 moles of OH- (0.1 moles * 2).

So the reaction is H+ + OH- → H2O, which releases heat.

The moles of H+ available are 0.28, OH- available are 0.2.

So all OH- will react, and the H+ will be 0.08 left.

But wait, Ba(OH)2 is a strong base, so it will react completely. But also, H2SO4 is a diprotic acid, but since the OH- is limited, which acid will the OH- react with first?

Wait, perhaps the more concentrated acid reacts first. But I think the order doesn't matter because both acids are contributing H+ ions which can react with OH-.

So the total H+ reacting is 0.2 moles, and the remaining H+ is 0.08 moles.

Now, the enthalpy change for neutralization is usually given per mole of H+ (or OH-) reacting. The standard enthalpy of neutralization is about -57 kJ/mol (or sometimes approximated as -57 kcal/mol, but I think the exact value can vary). Wait, but wait, the units in the options are in kcal and kJ. Let me recall: 1 kcal is about 4.184 kJ, but sometimes in chemistry, people use different approximations.

Wait, standard enthalpy of neutralization is approximately -57 kJ per mole of H+ (or OH-) when a strong acid reacts with a strong base. So each mole of H+ reacting releases about 57 kJ (exothermic, so negative).

So in this case, 0.2 moles of H+ reacting with OH- will release 0.2 * 57 kJ = 11.4 kJ. So the enthalpy change is -11.4 kJ.

Wait, but looking at the options, option B is -11.42 kcal, which is about -11.4 kJ if we consider 1 kcal ≈4.18 kJ. Wait, that's a bit confusing. Let me check the options again.

Wait, option D is -16.0 kJ, and option B is -11.42 kcal. Wait, but if each mole is 57 kJ, then 0.2 would be 11.4 kJ. But option B is in kcal, which would be 11.4 kJ divided by 4.184 to get kcal. Let me calculate that.

11.4 kJ is approximately 11.4 /4.184 ≈2.72 kcal. Because 1 kcal ≈4.184 kJ. So 2.72 kcal is about 11.4 kJ.

Wait, but the options are:

A) -2.72 kcal

B) -11.42 kcal

C) -3.80 kcal

D) -16.0 kJ

So the correct answer in kJ would be -11.4 kJ, which is approximately -11.42 kcal if we use 11.4 kJ = about 2.72 kcal (wait no, 11.4 kJ is about 2.72 kcal? No, that can't be right.

Wait, wait, I'm getting confused with the units. Let me recalculate.

1 kcal = 4.184 kJ. So 11.4 kJ is equal to 11.4 /4.184 ≈2.72 kcal. So the enthalpy would be -2.72 kcal.

But wait, that would make option A the answer. But wait, that depends on whether the standard enthalpy is -57 kJ/mol or -57 kcal/mol.

Wait, I'm getting myself confused. Let me check: the standard enthalpy of neutralization is about -57 kJ per mole of acid, but wait, for each mole of H+.

Wait, no, the standard enthalpy of neutralization is the enthalpy change when one mole of H+ from a strong acid reacts with one mole of OH- from a strong base to form water.

So, per mole of H+ reacting, it's approximately -57 kJ (exothermic, so negative). So if 0.2 moles of H+ react, the enthalpy change is 0.2 * (-57 kJ) = -11.4 kJ.

Looking at the options, option D is -16.0 kJ, which is not matching. Option B is -11.42 kcal. Wait, which is about -47.7 kJ (because 11.42 kcal *4.184 ≈47.6 kJ). But that's not matching our 11.4 kJ.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the moles.

Let me go through again.

Moles of HCl: 0.5 L *0.2 M =0.1 mol → 0.1 mol H+

Moles of H2SO4: 0.3 L *0.3 M =0.09 mol → each gives 2 H+ → 0.18 mol H+

Total H+ =0.28 mol.

Moles of Ba(OH)2: 0.2 L *0.5 M =0.1 mol → each gives 2 OH- → 0.2 mol OH-.

So yes, 0.28 H+ and 0.2 OH-.

So the OH- is the limiting reagent. So 0.2 moles of H+ will react with OH-.

So the enthalpy change is 0.2 * (-57 kJ) = -11.4 kJ.

Looking at the options, option D is -16.0 kJ, which is higher. Option B is -11.42 kcal, which is about -47.7 kJ. So that's not matching. Option A is -2.72 kcal, which is about -11.4 kJ (since 2.72 kcal *4.184≈11.4 kJ). So option A is -2.72 kcal, which is -11.4 kJ.

But wait, let me check the options again. Oh, option B is -11.42 kcal. So that's big. But if the answer is -11.4 kJ, which is option D, but option D is -16.0 kJ. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake.

Alternatively, perhaps the enthalpy of neutralization per mole is -57 kcal/mol. Because sometimes it's given in kcal. Let me think. If the standard enthalpy is approximately -57 kcal per mole of H+.

In that case, 0.2 moles would give 0.2 * (-57) = -11.4 kcal. So the answer would be approximately -11.4 kcal, which matches option B as -11.42 kcal.

But wait, is the standard enthalpy of neutralization -57 kJ or -57 kcal per mole?

I recall that 1 cal = 4.184 J, so 1 kcal = 4184 J. The enthalpy of neutralization is about 57 kJ per mole, which is 13.6 kcal per mole (since 57,000 J /4184 ≈13.6 kcal). But I'm not certain. So perhaps I'm mixing up the units.

Wait, I think the standard value is around -57 kJ per mole. So 0.2 moles would give -11.4 kJ. So looking at the options, option D is -16.0 kJ, which is not matching. So perhaps I made a mistake in the moles.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of moles of H+ from H2SO4.

Wait, H2SO4 is 0.3 M, 300 mL is 0.3 L. So moles of H2SO4 is 0.3 *0.3=0.09 moles. Each gives 2 H+ →0.18 mol. So that's correct.

Wait, but wait, another angle: when H2SO4 and Ba(OH)2 are mixed, they react to form BaSO4 precipitate. So the reaction is Ba(OH)2 + H2SO4 → BaSO4 ↓ + 2 H2O.

In this reaction, each mole of H2SO4 reacts with one mole of Ba(OH)2, producing 2 H2O and one mole of BaSO4.

So in this case, how much of each is present?

Moles of Ba(OH)2: 0.5 *0.2 =0.1 moles.

Moles of H2SO4: 0.3 *0.3 =0.09 moles.

So Ba(OH)2 is in excess because 0.1 > 0.09.

So all H2SO4 (0.09 moles) will react with Ba(OH)2 (0.09 moles), leaving 0.01 moles of Ba(OH)2.

So the reaction between H2SO4 and Ba(OH)2 will produce 0.09 moles of BaSO4 and 0.18 moles of H2O. The enthalpy change for this reaction is more than just neutralization because it's a precipitation reaction.

Wait, but this complicates things because the enthalpy of neutralization is per mole of H+ and OH- reacting, but if the reaction is a neutralization followed by precipitation, the calculation might involve both.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Because when mixing all three solutions, the HCl and the remaining Ba(OH)2 will react. Because after the H2SO4 and Ba(OH)2 have reacted, some Ba(OH)2 remains, which will then react with HCl.

Wait, that makes sense.

So let's break it down step by step.

Step 1: H2SO4 reacts with Ba(OH)2.

Moles H2SO4: 0.09.

Moles Ba(OH)2: 0.1.

Molar ratio is 1:1. So 0.09 moles of each will react.

So H2SO4: 0.09 →0.09 reacts, 0 left.

Ba(OH)2: 0.09 reacts, 0.01 remains.

Products: 0.09 moles BaSO4 precipitate and 0.18 moles H2O.

The enthalpy change for this reaction is the enthalpy of precipitation plus the enthalpy of neutralization.

But perhaps it's more straightforward to calculate the neutralization enthalpy for this reaction as well. Alternatively, perhaps the neutralization here is part of the overall calculation.

Wait, perhaps the overall reaction can be considered as the sum of all the H+ from HCl and H2SO4 reacting with OH- from Ba(OH)2.

But I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me try another approach.

Total H+ from HCl and H2SO4: 0.1 + 0.18 =0.28.

Total OH- from Ba(OH)2:0.2.

So H+ and OH- will neutralize each other, producing water. The excess H+ will remain.

So the moles of H+ reacting: 0.2.

The moles of OH- reacting:0.2.

The neutralization reaction is H+ + OH- → H2O, which releases 57 kJ per mole.

So the enthalpy change is 0.2 * (-57 kJ) = -11.4 kJ.

But looking at the options, option D is -16.0 kJ, which isn't matching. So perhaps my approach is wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps the enthalpy of neutralization is -57.3 kcal per mole. Because 57.3 kcal is about 240 kJ (wait, that can't be right). Wait, 57.3 kJ is approximately 13.66 kcal.

Wait, I'm getting confused between kJ and kcal.

Wait, let me double-check the standard enthalpy of neutralization. It is approximately -57 kJ per mole of H+ (or OH-). So 0.2 moles would be -11.4 kJ.

Now, looking at the options:

Option D: -16.0 kJ → No.

Option B: -11.42 kcal → So if the answer is -11.4 kJ, which is approximately -2.72 kcal (since 11.4 /4.184 ≈2.72). So that would match option A.

Wait, that can't be right because 2.72 kcal is about 11.4 kJ. So option A is -2.72 kcal, which is -11.4 kJ. So that would be the correct answer.

Wait, but the question is about enthalpy of neutralization. So the calculation is based on the H+ and OH- reacting.

So the correct answer would be -11.4 kJ, which is approximately -2.72 kcal (as 11.4 kJ is about 2.72 kcal). So the answer is option A.

Wait, but the options are:

A) -2.72 kcal → which is -11.4 kJ.

B) -11.42 kcal → which is about -47.7 kJ.

Other options don't match.

So the correct answer would be option A.


To calculate the enthalpy of neutralization when mixing 500 mL 0.2 M HCl, 300 mL 0.3 M H₂SO₄, and 200 mL 0.5 M Ba(OH)₂, the following steps are considered:

1. **Determine moles of H⁺ from acids:**
   - **HCl:**  
     Moles of HCl = \( 0.2 \, \text{M} \times 0.5 \, \text{L} = 0.1 \, \text{mol} \).  
     Each mole of HCl contributes 1 mole of H⁺, so total H⁺ from HCl = \( 0.1 \, \text{mol} \).
   - **H₂SO₄:**  
     Moles of H₂SO₄ = \( 0.3 \, \text{M} \times 0.3 \, \text{L} = 0.09 \, \text{mol} \).  
     Each mole of H₂SO₄ contributes 2 moles of H⁺, so total H⁺ from H₂SO₄ = \( 0.09 \times 2 = 0.18 \, \text{mol} \).
   - **Total H⁺ from acids:**  
     \( 0.1 + 0.18 = 0.28 \, \text{mol} \).

2. **Determine moles of OH⁻ from Ba(OH)₂:**
   - Moles of Ba(OH)₂ = \( 0.5 \, \text{M} \times 0.2 \, \text{L} = 0.1 \, \text{mol} \).  
     Each mole of Ba(OH)₂ contributes 2 moles of OH⁻, so total OH⁻ = \( 0.1 \times 2 = 0.2 \, \text{mol} \).

3. **Determine limiting reactant:**
   - The reaction \( \text{H⁺} + \text{OH⁻} \to \text{H₂O} \) requires 1 mole of H⁺ and 1 mole of OH⁻.  
   - Total H⁺ available = \( 0.28 \, \text{mol} \), and total OH⁻ available = \( 0.2 \, \text{mol} \).  
   - OH⁻ is the limiting reactant, as it is present in smaller quantity.

4. **Calculate enthalpy change:**
   - The standard enthalpy of neutralization is approximately \( -57 \, \text{kJ/mol} \) per mole of H⁺ or OH⁻ reacting.  
   - Moles of H⁺ reacting = moles of OH⁻ = \( 0.2 \, \text{mol} \).  
   - Enthalpy change = \( 0.2 \times (-57) = -11.4 \, \text{kJ} \).  
   - Converting to kcal: \( 1 \, \text{kJ} \approx 0.239 \, \text{kcal} \), so \( -11.4 \, \text{kJ} \approx -2.72 \, \text{kcal} \).

5. **Match with options:**
   - Option A: \( -2.72 \, \text{kcal} \) matches the calculated value.  
   - Option B (\( -11.42 \, \text{kcal} \)) corresponds to \( -47.7 \, \text{kJ} \), which is incorrect.  
   - Options C and D are also inconsistent with the calculation.

Thus, the correct answer is **A) -2.72 kcal**.

Answer: A
