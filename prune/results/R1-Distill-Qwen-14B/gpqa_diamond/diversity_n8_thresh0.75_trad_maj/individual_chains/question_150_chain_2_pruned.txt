Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through step by step. Let's see what the question is.

The compound has the molecular formula C8H9NO. Hmm, let me calculate the degree of unsaturation to get an idea of what kind of structure I might be dealing with. Degree of unsaturation is (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. Here, C is 8, H is 9, N is 1, and O is 1. So plugging in: (2*8 +2 -9 -0 +1)/2 = (18-9+1)/2=10/2=5. So five degrees: that could be like a benzene ring (3 double bonds or 3 degrees), a carbonyl group, and maybe a double bond or ring. So probably a benzene ring with some substituents and maybe an aldehyde group or a ketone.

Looking at the NMR data: 9.72 ppm, that's a triplet integrating for 1H. High ppm, so probably an aldehyde proton. Aldehyde protons usually show up around 9-10 ppm, so that makes sense. Then, 6.98 ppm is a doublet (d) for 2H. Next, 6.51 ppm is another doublet for 2H. That's typical of a para-substituted benzene ring. The 6.27 ppm is a broad singlet (bs) for 2H. Hmm, maybe some coupling with another proton or perhaps an aromatic ring substitution. Then 3.66 ppm is a doublet for 2H, probably some kind of CH2 group attached to something electronegative, like oxygen or a carbonyl.

Putting this together, perhaps the molecule has a benzene ring with substituents, maybe an aldehyde group, and some CH2 groups attached to oxygen.

Looking at the reagents: first is NaNO2 and HCl. That's usually for diazotization, which is used in reactions like the Sandmeyer reaction or maybe forming a diazonium salt. Then, H2O as the second step, which might be hydrolysis. Third step is aqueous KOH with heat, which suggests some kind of elimination or maybe a nucleophilic substitution.

Wait, but for the reaction steps: first, diazotization. Diazonium salt formation usually happens with primary amines, but in this case, the molecular formula includes an O, so maybe the starting compound has an amine group. Or perhaps it's another functional group.

Wait, the molecular formula has N and O. So perhaps the starting compound is an aromatic amine with an aldehyde group or something. Let me think.

The NMR shows an aldehyde proton. So maybe the structure is something like benzaldehyde with another substituent.

Wait, the initial NMR data: 9.72 (t, 1H) suggests a triplet, so maybe coupling with two equivalent protons. Like if the aldehyde is adjacent to a CH2 group. So perhaps it's RCH2CHO, but I'm not sure.

Wait, but another possibility: the aldehyde is part of a conjugated system, maybe an alpha, beta-unsaturated aldehyde. That could explain the triplet if the aldehyde is next to a double bond. But I'm not too sure.

Let me think about the structure based on the NMR. The aromatic region shows two doublets, which suggests a para-substituted benzene. So maybe the benzene ring has two substituents in the para positions. But wait, the 6.98 and 6.51 are both doublets, each integrating for 2H. That's typical of a para-disubstituted benzene. So maybe the benzene has two substituents, each being CH2 groups attached to something else.

Wait, but wait, the
