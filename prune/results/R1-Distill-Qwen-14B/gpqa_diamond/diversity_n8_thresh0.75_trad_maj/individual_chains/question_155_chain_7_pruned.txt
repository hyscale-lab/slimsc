Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The problem describes an operator P with components P_x, P_y, and P_z. Each of these has a matrix form given in a particular basis. The basis vectors are the eigenvectors of P_z, which probably means that the P_z matrix is diagonal in this basis, since it's the basis of its eigenvectors.

The system is in the eigenstate of P_x corresponding to the eigenvalue -ħ. The state vector is given as a column vector with elements (-1/2, 1/sqrt(2), -1/2). So the state is |ψ> = [ -1/2; 1/sqrt(2); -1/2 ].

The question asks for the uncertainty ΔP_z of the operator P_z. I remember that the uncertainty in an observable is given by the square root of the variance, which is <P_z²> - <P_z>².

So first, I need to compute the expectation value <P_z> and the expectation value of P_z squared <P_z²>. Then, take the square root of the difference.

But wait, the state is given in the basis of P_z, right? Because the basis vectors are the eigenvectors of P_z. That means the matrix for P_z is diagonal in this basis. Let me look at the P_z matrix again.

The P_z matrix is:

First row: (ħ, 0, 0)
Second row: (0, 0, 0)
Third row: (0, 0, -ħ)

So it's a diagonal matrix with eigenvalues ħ, 0, -ħ for the three basis states, respectively.

Since the state is given in this basis, the components of the state vector are the coefficients of each eigenstate. So, the state |ψ> is a linear combination of the eigenstates of P_z. Each component corresponds to the amplitude of each eigenstate.

The state vector is [ -1/2, 1/sqrt(2), -1/2 ]^T. Let me check: the first component is -1/2, which is the amplitude for the eigenstate with eigenvalue ħ. The second component is 1/sqrt(2) for the eigenstate with eigenvalue 0. The third component is -1/2 for the eigenstate with eigenvalue -ħ.

So, to find <P_z>, the expectation value, I can compute the sum of the probabilities (the square of the amplitudes) multiplied by their respective eigenvalues.

Wait, no, wait. The expectation value is the sum of |amplitude|^2 multiplied by their eigenvalues, plus any cross terms? No, wait, because in an eigenbasis of the operator, the expectation value is just the weighted sum of the eigenvalues, weighted by the probability of each eigenstate.

So, for each basis state |k>, the contribution to <P_z> is |c_k|^2 * p_k, where c_k is the amplitude of state |k> in |ψ>, and p_k is the eigenvalue of P_z for |k>.

So, let me compute each part.

First, calculate |c_1|^2: (-1/2)^2 = 1/4.

|c_2|^2: (1/sqrt(2))^2 = 1/2.

|c_3|^2: (-1/2)^2 = 1/4.

So the sum of squares is 1/4 + 1/2 + 1/4 = 1, which makes sense because the vector should be normalized.

The eigenvalues of P_z for each state are:

State 1: ħ

State 2: 0

State 3: -ħ

So, <P_z> = (1/4)*ħ + (1/2)*0 + (1/4)*(-ħ) = (1/4 - 1/4) ħ + 0 = 0.

Hmm, interesting. So the expectation value is zero. That simplifies things a bit.

Next, I need to compute <P_z²>. Since P_z is diagonal, P_z squared would be the square of each diagonal element. So the eigenvalues for P_z squared would be (ħ)^2, 0^2, and (-ħ)^2. So, eigenvalues are ħ², 0, ħ².

So, <P_z²> = |c_1|^2*(ħ²) + |c_2|^2*(0) + |c_3|^2*(ħ²).

Plugging in the values: (1/4)*ħ² + (1/2)*0 + (1/4)*ħ² = (1/4 + 1/4) ħ² = (1/2) ħ².

So, the variance is <P_z²> - <P_z>² =
