Okay, so I have this problem here about stars and their elemental abundances. Hmm, let's see what it's asking. So, there are two stars, Star_1 and Star_2, each with different massesâ€”1.5 and 1.2 times the Sun's mass. But wait, I think the masses might not be directly relevant here since the question is about the elemental abundance ratios, which are given.

The problem states that using the Equivalent Width (EW) method under LTE, the abundances are determined. The given values are [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 dex, [Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3 dex, [Fe/H]_1 = 0 dex, and [Mg/H]_2 = 0 dex. Oh, right! The brackets here denote logarithmic abundances relative to hydrogen or another element. So [X/Y] = log(n_X / n_Y) - log(n_X / n_Y)_sun.

The Sun's photospheric composition is given as 12 + log10(nFe/nH) =7.5 and similarly for Mg, it's 12 + log10(nMg/nH)=7. Hmm, wait, okay. So for the Sun, nFe/nH is 10^( (7.5 -12) ), right? Because the formula is 12 + log(ratio) = value, so log(ratio) is value minus 12.

Oh, wait, no. Let me think. The Sun's data is given as 12 + log(nFe/nH) = 7.5. So that means log(nFe/nH) = 7.5 -12 = -4.5. Therefore, nFe/nH = 10^(-4.5). Similarly, for Mg, log(nMg/nH) = 7 -12= -5. So nMg/nH =10^-5.

Now, the question is to find the ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2. So, we're looking for [Si_1 / Si_2] or (n_Si1 / n_Si2) ratio.

Wait, but to get that, I think I need to find n_Si1 and n_Si2 in terms relative to the Sun, then take their ratio.

Let me outline the steps:

1. For Star_1:

Given [Fe/H]_1 =0. So the metallicity [Fe/H]=0, which means [Fe/H] = log(nFe/nH) - log(nFe/nH)_sun = 0. So log(nFe1/nH1) = log(nFe_sun/nH_sun). So nFe1/nH1 = nFe_sun/nH_sun. Because [Fe/H] is 0, their iron to hydrogen ratio is same as the Sun.

Wait, but [Fe/H] is a logarithmic scale. So [Fe/H] = log(nFe/nH) - log(nFe/nH)_sun. If that's 0, then log(nFe/nH) = log(nFe_sun/nH_sun), so nFe/nH = nFe_sun/nH_sun. So yes, Star_1's [Fe/H] is 0, so nFe1/nH1 =
