Okay, so I've got this question about stars being uniformly distributed in the sky and how the number of stars per unit range of parallax changes with parallax. Hmm, let's try to think this through.

Parallax is a measure of distance; the closer a star is, the larger its parallax. Oh wait, no, I remember that actually, the parallax is inversely proportional to distance. So a larger parallax means the star is closer, right? Because parallax is 1 over distance in parsecs. So plx = 1/d, so as d increases, plx decreases.

The question is about the number of stars per unit range of plx. So if I have a range of parallax values, how does the number of stars in each plx bin change with plx?

Wait, stars are uniformly distributed, but uniform in what sense? Uniform in space would mean that the number density is the same everywhere, but the distribution on the sky might not account for distance. Or maybe it's uniform in terms of their positions on the celestial sphere, but that's more about angles, not distances.

Wait, the problem says stars are uniformly distributed in the sky. So perhaps that's in terms of solid angle, but not considering distance. Or maybe they're spread out uniformly with respect to their positions in space but not considering their distribution in distance. Hmm.

Wait, but for a uniform distribution in space, the number density is constant. So, the number of stars in a certain volume would depend on the volume. If they're uniformly distributed, the number per unit volume is the same everywhere.

But parallax relates to distance. So, how does the number of stars in a certain parallax range (like between plx and plx + dplx) depend on plx?

Let me think about the relation between distance and parallax. Parallax (in arcseconds) is given by plx = 1/d, where d is in parsecs. So d = 1/plx. 

If I consider a thin shell at distance d with thickness dr, the volume of that shell is 4πd² dr. The number of stars in that shell would be n * 4πd² dr, where n is the number density (stars per unit volume).

Now, the parallax corresponding to d is plx = 1/d. So, for a parallax between plx and plx + dplx, what is the corresponding change in d?

Since plx = 1/d, then d = 1/plx. So, the change in plx dplx would be the derivative of plx with respect to d times dr. Let's see:

dplx = (d/d d)(1/d) dr = (-1/d²) dr → dr = - d² dplx.

Wait, but since d is a positive quantity and we're considering increases in plx as d decreases, perhaps it's better to express the number of stars in terms of plx.

The number of stars in a parallax range [plx, plx + dplx] is the same as the number of stars in the distance range [d, d - dd], where dd is the change in distance. So, let's express the volume in terms of d.

The number of stars is N = n * 4π d² dd.

But we want to express this in terms of plx. Since plx = 1/d, d = 1/plx. So, substitute d into the expression.

N = n * 4π (1/plx)^2 * dd.

But we need to express dd in terms of dplx. From plx = 1/d, taking differentials gives dplx = -1/d² dd → dd = -d² dplx.

Wait,
