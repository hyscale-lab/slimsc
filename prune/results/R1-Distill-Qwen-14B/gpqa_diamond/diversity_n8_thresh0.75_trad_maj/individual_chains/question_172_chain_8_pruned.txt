Okay, so I've got this question about stars and iron atoms in their photospheres. Hmm, let's think through this. I remember that in stellar atmospheres, when they're in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE), the distribution of atoms in different energy levels follows the Boltzmann equation.

The question says that the iron atoms in star_1's photosphere are twice as excited in a specific energy level as those in star_2. Oh wait, so the ratio of the populations is n1/n2 = 2. And the energy difference between the levels is given as 1.38e-23 J. 

I think the Boltzmann factor comes into play here. The formula is n_i / n_j = (g_i/g_j) * exp( - (E_i - E_j)/(k T) ). Since the question is about the ratio of two stars, maybe I can set up the equations for each star and then relate them.

Let me denote star_1 as T1 and star_2 as T2. For each, we have n_i and n_j ratios. Assuming the ground state is j and the excited state is i, and that the statistical weights are the same for both stars (since they're iron atoms in the same energy levels), g_i/g_j would be the same for both. So the ratio n1_i/n1_j would be exp( -ΔE/(k T1) ), and similarly for star_2: n2_i/n2_j = exp( -ΔE/(k T2) ).

Wait, but the problem says that in star_1, the excited state is twice as populated as in star_2. So n1_i = 2 * n2_i? Or wait, no. Wait, the question says that the excited atoms in star_1 are twice as excited as in star_2. So maybe n1_i = 2 n2_i. Or is it n1_i / n1_j = 2 (n2_i / n2_j) ? Hmm, I need to clarify.

Wait, actually, the problem states that the iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level when compared to star_2. So the ratio of excited to ground state (or perhaps the ratio of that level to another) is twice as high in star_1. So perhaps (n_i/n_j)_1 = 2*(n_i/n_j)_2.

Wait, but according to the Boltzmann equation, n_i/n_j = exp( -ΔE/(kT) ), assuming that the ratio of
