Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about enthalpy of neutralization. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think it through.

The question says that we're mixing three solutions: 500 mL of 0.2 M HCl, 300 mL of 0.3 M H2SO4, and 200 mL of 0.5 M Ba(OH)2. And we need to find the enthalpy of neutralization.

Wait, enthalpy of neutralization is usually the heat released when an acid reacts with a base to form water, right? And it's often given in kJ/mol, but the options here have kcal and kJ. Oh, right, I remember that 1 kcal is about 4.184 kJ. So I'll have to pay attention to the units when I'm done.

But first, I think I should figure out how much acid and base we're dealing with, and whether they're in stoichiometric proportions. Because if one is in excess, the other will determine the amount of reaction.

Let me break it down step by step.

First, find the moles of each acid and base.

HCl is a strong acid. Each mole of HCl gives one mole of H+ ions. So for HCl:

Molarity is 0.2 M, volume is 500 mL, which is 0.5 L.

Moles HCl = M * V = 0.2 * 0.5 = 0.1 mol.

H2SO4 is a strong acid too, and it's diprotic. Each mole gives two H+ ions. So for H2SO4:

Molarity 0.3 M, volume 300 mL = 0.3 L.

Moles H2SO4 = 0.3 * 0.3 = 0.09 mol. So H+ from H2SO4 is 2 * 0.09 = 0.18 mol.

Wait, but wait. Alternatively, when H2SO4 reacts with a base, does it donate both H+ ions? Well, in the case of neutralization with a strong base like Ba(OH)2, I think it would donate both. But maybe in some cases, only the first H+ is considered in neutralization. Hmm. But I'm not sure. Let me think. Enthalpy of neutralization typically refers to the reaction with the base, so maybe all H+ ions are used. So I'll proceed with 0.18 mol of H+ from H2SO4.

Then Ba(OH)2 is a strong base. Each mole of Ba(OH)2 gives two OH- ions. So for Ba(OH)2:

Molarity 0.5 M, volume 200 mL = 0.2 L.

Moles Ba(OH)2 = 0.5 * 0.2 = 0.1 mol. So OH- ions are 2 * 0.1 = 0.2 mol.

Now, the total H+ from acids is HCl's 0.1 mol and H2SO4's 0.18 mol. So total H+ is 0.28 mol.

The OH- is 0.2 mol.

So when they react, the H+ and OH- will combine. The reaction is H+ + OH- â†’ H2O.

So the neutralization reaction. The limiting reagent here is OH- because we have 0.28 mol H+ and 0.2 mol OH-.

Wait, wait. Wait a second, wait. Let me think. The neutralization would involve the H+ from both acids reacting with the OH- from the base. So the total H+ is 0.28 mol, and OH- is 0.2 mol. So the OH- is the limiting factor. So all 0.2 mol of OH- will react with 0.2 mol of H+.

Wait, but wait. Let me double-check this. So
