Okay, let's try to work through this chemistry problem. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll give it a shot.

So, the question is about molecular symmetry groups of product E. The options are A) C2, B) D4h, C) D∞h, D) C2v. Hmm, I remember symmetry groups are about the shapes of molecules and their symmetry elements.

Let me start by breaking down the reactions given step by step.

The first reaction: Solid A reacts with 8 equivalents of gas B to form bright red product C. So, A + 8B → C. What's a reaction where a solid reacts with gas in such a ratio? Maybe something like sulfur reacting with something, but I'm not sure yet.

Second reaction: C reacts with 2 equivalents of gas D to produce E, which is extremely hazardous. So, C + 2D → E. Maybe E is some kind of dangerous compound, like a toxic gas or a explosive material.

Third reaction: C reacts with water to reform A plus two different acids F and G. F is a strong acid, G a weak one. So, C + H2O → A + F + G. Since it's producing acids, maybe C is a salt or a metal oxide. If F is strong and G is weak, perhaps F is H2SO4 (sulfuric acid) and G is something like HNO2 (nitrous acid) or H3PO4? Wait, no, wait. Strong acids are like HCl, H2SO4, HNO3. Weak ones are like CH3COOH, HNO2, H3PO4, etc.

Fourth reaction: D reacts with B in a 1:1 ratio to form H, which is a solvent. So, D + B → H. H is a solvent, maybe something like ethanol or water? Or perhaps something else. But D and B are gases. Hmm, gas reacting to form a solvent—could be something like HCl and NH3 reacting to form NH4Cl? No, but that's a solid. Alternatively, maybe D is Cl2 and B is O2? Wait, when O2 reacts with Cl2? No, maybe D is H2 and B is O2? But H2 and O2 react to form H2O, but that's a liquid. Hmm, not sure.

Wait, the fourth reaction says D and B react in a 1:1 ratio to form H, which is a solvent. Another possibility is that D is NH3 and B is HCl, but that would form NH4Cl, which is a solid. Wait, maybe H is an alcohol? Or perhaps H is something like H2O? But H2O is a product, not a reactant.

Wait, let's think about the possible substances. Let's try to find out what A, B, C, D, E, etc., could be.

Looking at the third reaction again: C + H2O → A + F + G. So, when C reacts with water, it produces a solid (A) and two acids. Maybe C is an oxide. If it's an oxide reacting with water to form acids, that suggests C is a metal oxide. For example, if A is a metal, and C is its oxide.

Wait, if F is a strong acid and G a weak acid, perhaps C is a metal oxide that when hydrolyzed produces both strong and weak acids. For example, if C is a mixture of two metal oxides? Or perhaps C is a more complex compound.

Alternatively, maybe C is a salt that when reacted with water produces an acid and a base. But it says two different acids, so maybe it's a diacid or something else.

Another approach: Let's think about product E. E is produced when C reacts with D. So, C + 2D → E. Since E is hazardous, perhaps it's a toxic gas or a dangerous compound. What are some reactions that produce hazardous substances? Maybe the formation of a cyanide compound, or something like phosgene, but I'm not sure.

Wait, let's think about the reactions again. The first reaction uses 8 equivalents of B. That's a lot. Maybe it's something like sulfur (A) reacting with oxygen (B) to form SO3 (C). Because sulfur is solid, O2 is a gas. 8 equivalents would imply a stoichiometric ratio like 1:8, but wait, sulfur's reaction with O2 is
