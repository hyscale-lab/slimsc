Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. It's about identifying a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring compound based on its spectroscopic data. Let me read the question again and try to break it down.

The compound is di-substituted, which means there are two substituents attached to the benzene ring. The FTIR shows ester groups, so there's definitely an ester functional group present. Esters have a carbonyl group (C=O) and an ether linkage (O). So, the ester is probably attached to the benzene ring as a substituent.

Looking at the 1H NMR data: there are six signals in total. Hmm, six signals can correspond to different types of protons in the molecule. Let's go through them:

1. Two signals from aromatic-H. That makes sense because the ring is di-substituted, which typically leads to two sets of aromatic protons depending on their positions relative to the substituents. Maybe para-substituted or ortho/para, but since there are two signals, perhaps each substituent affects the ring protons differently, leading to two distinct environments.

2. Two signals for vinyl-H. One is a doublet, and the other is a doublet of quartets. Vinyl protons are typically those attached to double bonds, like in an ester group. Wait, in an ester, the carbonyl is next to an oxygen, but the actual vinyl protons would be in a substituent group. Oh, maybe the ester is part of a substituent like an acetyloxy group or something else. Alternatively, maybe the substituent is a vinyl group attached to the ring, but I'm not sure.

Wait, ester groups are usually R-O-CO-O-R', but no, wait, no, an ester is like R-O-CO-R'. So the substituent would be an O-CO-O-R group perhaps. No, wait, more accurately, an ester group is RCOOR', so like an acetyloxy group. So if the substituent is an ester, then the structure would be something like benzene with an acetyl group attached via an oxygen (like OAc).

Alternatively, maybe the substituent is a vinyl ester, but that's a bit more complicated. Let me think about the NMR signals. The vinyl-Hs: a doublet and a doublet of quartets. For vinyl protons, coupling with adjacent protons gives rise to doublets or doublet of
