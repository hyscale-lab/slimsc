Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Let me try to work through it step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll do my best.

The problem says: We have an electron state |alpha> which is proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>. We need to find the probabilities of measuring the particle in each of the eigenstates of a certain operator A. The matrix elements of A are given as A_ij = ħ/2 if i≠j, and 0 otherwise. Also, we have to find the average value of this operator.

Hmm. First, I think I should normalize the state |alpha>. Because the problem says it's proportional, so the coefficients aren't normalized yet.

So the state is |alpha> = (1+i)|up> + (2 -i)|down>. The normalization factor is the square root of the sum of the squares of the magnitudes of the coefficients.

Let me calculate the coefficients:

The first term's coefficient is (1+i). Its magnitude squared is (1)^2 + (1)^2 = 2.
The second term's coefficient is (2 - i). Its magnitude squared is (2)^2 + (-1)^2 = 4 + 1 =5.

So the total squared magnitude is 2 +5 =7. Therefore, the normalization factor is sqrt(7). So the normalized state is |alpha> = [ (1+i)/sqrt(7) ) |up> + (2 -i)/sqrt(7) |down> ].

Now, the operator A has a matrix representation where A_ij = ħ/2 when i≠j, and 0 otherwise. Wait, wait. The operator is a 2x2 matrix because we're dealing with spin up and down states, which form a two-dimensional space.

So the matrix A would look like this:

A = [ [0, ħ/2],
       [ħ/2, 0] ]

Because for i≠j, the elements are ħ/2, and the diagonals are zero.

Wait, that's a 2x2 matrix. So operator A is [[0, ħ/2], [ħ/2, 0]]. That looks like a spin operator in the x-direction, but scaled. Because the Pauli X matrix is [[0,1],[1,0]], so A is (ħ/2) times that. So A is (ħ/2) σ_x.

But wait, the eigenstates of σ_x are the spin eigenstates in the x-direction. So the eigenstates of A are the same as those of σ_x. So perhaps I can find the eigenstates of A by diagonalizing σ_x, but scaled.

Alternatively, I could diagonalize A directly. But maybe it's easier to think in terms of the eigenstates of σ_x.

The eigenstates of σ_x are |+x> and |-x>, which are superpositions of |up> and |down>.

Wait, |+x> is (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2), and |-x> is (|up>
