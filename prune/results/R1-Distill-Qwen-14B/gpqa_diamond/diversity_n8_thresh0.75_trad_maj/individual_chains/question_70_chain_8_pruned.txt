Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the molecular symmetry group of product E. Hmm, let me try to break this down step by step.

First, let's read the question carefully. There are a series of reactions described, and each step gives some information about the compounds involved. My goal is to figure out the structure of E to determine its molecular symmetry, which relates to its point group.

The first reaction is solid A reacting with 8 equivalents of gas B to form bright red product C. Okay, so A + 8 B → C. What could this be? I'm thinking about reactions where a solid reacts with a gas in a molar ratio of 8. Maybe something like sulfur reacting with something, but sulfur is bright red as a solid. Alternatively, maybe it's a transition metal compound.

Wait, another thought—what about the formation of a nitride or some kind of oxide? Let's think about what forms a bright red product. Oh, maybe sulfur trioxide? No, wait, sulfur trioxide is a liquid. Or perhaps it's something else.

Wait! I remember that when sodium reacts with something, but that's probably not it. Hmm, maybe the bright red product is a transition metal compound. Wait, another angle—maybe A is a metal, and B is a halogen. For example, if A is sodium (Na) and B is chlorine (Cl₂), but 8 equivalents? That would mean 8 moles of Cl₂ per mole of Na. But the reaction of sodium with chlorine is 2 Na + Cl₂ → 2 NaCl. That doesn't add up to 8 equivalents. Hmm, maybe I'm on the wrong track.

Wait, another possible reaction: the reaction of a metal with sulfur. Sulfur is bright yellow, but maybe the product is a sulfide. But sulfides are usually not bright red. Alternatively, maybe it's the formation of a compound with a high oxidation state. For instance, the reaction of a metal with oxygen to form an oxide. But that's probably not the case.

Wait a moment—maybe A is a metal and B is a diatomic gas, but in a ratio of 8. Let me think about possible combinations. For example, if A is Fe and B is O₂, but then FeO would form, but that's not bright red. Alternatively, maybe the product is Fe₃O₄? But I'm not sure about the color.

Alternatively, maybe A is a metal and B is another gas, like CO₂. But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the product C is a compound with a high oxidation state. Alternatively, maybe it's a reaction like the formation of a tetrafluoride. For example, if A is Ca (calcium) and B is F₂, but 8 F₂ per Ca? Calcium fluoride is CaF₂, which would require 2 F₂ per Ca. So that's not matching.

Wait, another thought—maybe A is a metal and B is a diatomic gas, but in a 1:8 ratio. So for each A, 8 B molecules are consumed. For example, if A is Mg and B is O₂, the reaction is 2 Mg + O₂ → 2 MgO. That's a 2:1 ratio of Mg to O₂, which doesn't fit. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe A is something like sodium (Na) and B is something else. Let me think about the 8 equivalents. Suppose A is Na and B is Cl₂. The reaction would be 2 Na + Cl₂ → 2 NaCl. That's 1 equivalent of Cl₂ per 2 Na, so that's 0.5 equivalents. Not 8.

Wait, perhaps the product C is a metal carbonyl. For example, nickel carbonyl is Ni(CO)4, which is a liquid, but I'm not sure about the color. Or maybe it's something else.

Alternatively, perhaps A is a transition metal and B is a ligand. Wait, but I'm not getting anywhere with that. Maybe I should move on and see what other clues I can find.

The next part says when C reacts with 2 equivalents of gas D, it produces product E, which is extremely hazardous. So C + 2 D → E. What could E be? Extremely hazardous suggests something like a nerve agent, but more likely perhaps a highly toxic gas, like HCl or something else. Hmm, but let's think
