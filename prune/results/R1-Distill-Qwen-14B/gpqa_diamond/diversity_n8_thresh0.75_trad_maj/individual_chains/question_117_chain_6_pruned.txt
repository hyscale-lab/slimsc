Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about organic chemistry, specifically about optical isomerism. Hmm, I need to figure out which of the given compounds exhibit optical isomerism. Optical isomerism is when a compound has stereoisomers that are non-superimposable mirror images of each other, right?

The question lists four compounds, numbered 1 to 4, and the options are A through D, each combining some of these. Let me go through each compound one by one.

Starting with compound 1: dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate. Biphenyl means two benzene rings connected by a single bond, right? So the structure would have the two benzene rings connected at the 1 and 1' positions. Then, there are nitro groups at the 6 and 6' positions and carboxylate groups at 2 and 2'. Wait, so the substituents are on each benzene ring but on positions that are across from each other. I think for biphenyl structures, when there's a single bond between the rings, the substituents can lead to different configurations. Now, does this compound have a plane of symmetry? If the substituents are symmetrical around the central bond, maybe not. Wait, the nitro groups are on 6 and 6', which are opposite positions on each ring. The carboxylates are on 2 and 2', which are also across each other. So maybe the structure is symmetrical. Alternatively, considering the biphenyl ring as a central axis, if the substituents are in positions that allow for free rotation, but wait, biphenyls can have restricted rotation because the single bond is between two aromatic rings which are bulky. So in this case, the substituents are in positions that might create enantiomers.

Wait, to have optical isomerism, the molecule must have a chiral center or some form of asymmetry that results in non-superimposable mirror images. Alternatively, if the molecule has a plane of symmetry, it can't be chiral.

But in this case, the substitu
