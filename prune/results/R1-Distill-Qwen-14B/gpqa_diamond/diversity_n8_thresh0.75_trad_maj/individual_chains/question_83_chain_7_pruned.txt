Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here. Let's see what it's about. Hmm, it's about titrating acetic acid with NaOH. I remember that acetic acid is a weak acid, and NaOH is a strong base. So when you titrate them, they react in a neutralization reaction.

The problem says we dilute 20 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid with 20 cm³ of water. Then we titrate that with 0.1 M NaOH. They're asking for the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point. Oh right, and the Ka of acetic acid is given as 1.85x10^-5.

Wait, first, I need to figure out what the initial concentrations are after dilution. Diluting 20 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid with 20 cm³ of water. So the total volume after dilution is 40 cm³, right? Because 20 +20 is 40. So the concentration after dilution would be (20 cm³ * 0.05 M) / 40 cm³. Let me calculate that. 20 * 0.05 is 1 mmol, divided by 40 cm³ (which is 0.04 L), wait wait, wait, no. Wait, 20 cm³ is 0.02 L. So 0.02 L * 0.05 mol/L = 0.001 mol. Then, 0.001 mol in 0.04 L gives 0.025 M. So the concentration after dilution is 0.025 M acetic acid.

Then, when we titrate this with 0.1 M NaOH, the equivalence point is when moles of NaOH equal moles of acetic acid. So the moles of acetic acid in the diluted solution is 0.001 mol. So moles of NaOH needed are also 0.001 mol.

Wait, but the volume of NaOH needed to reach the equivalence point can be calculated. The concentration of NaOH is 0.1 M, so moles = Molarity * Volume. So Volume = moles / Molarity. So 0.001 mol / 0.1 mol/L = 0.01 L, which is 10 cm³. So the equivalence point is at 10 cm³ of NaOH added.

Now, the first part is the pH at 25% titration. So 25% of the equivalence point volume is 10 cm³ * 0.25 = 2.5 cm³ of NaOH added. So at this point, only 25% of the acetic acid has been neutralized.

Let me think about how to calculate the pH here. At 25% titration, it's a buffer solution. The reaction between acetic acid and NaOH is CH3COOH + NaOH → CH3COO^- Na+ + H2O. So each mole of NaOH neutralizes a mole of CH3COOH to produce a mole of acetate ion.

So, the initial moles of acetic acid in the diluted solution are 0.001 mol. Adding 2.5 cm³ of 0.1 M NaOH is 0.0025 L * 0.1 mol/L = 0.00025 mol of NaOH. So moles of acetic acid reacted = 0.00025 mol. So remaining acetic acid is 0.001 - 0.00025 = 0.00075 mol. And moles of acetate ion produced is 0.00025 mol.

Now, the total volume is the initial diluted solution (40 cm³) plus the added NaOH (2.5 cm³), so 42.5 cm³ or 0.0425 L.

So concentrations are: [CH3COOH] = 0.00075 / 0.0425 ≈ 0.017647 M. [CH3COO^-] = 0.00025 / 0.0425 ≈ 0.005882 M.

Since it's a buffer, we can use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation: pH = pKa + log([A^-]/[HA]).

The pKa is -log(1.85e-5). Let me calculate that. log(1.85) is about 0.267, so 0.267 -5 is 4.733, so pKa ≈ 4.733.

So pH = 4.733 + log(0.005882 / 0.017647). Let me compute the ratio: 0.005882 / 0.017647 is about 0.333. So log(1/3) is about -0.477. So pH is 4.733 -0.477 ≈ 4.256. So approx 4.26.

Hmm, looking at the options, option A has 4.26 as the first value, and option D has 4.57, but wait, let me double-check my calculations. Maybe I made a mistake.

Wait, let's recompute the ratio. 0.00025 / 0.0425 L is 0.005882 M. 0.00075 / 0.0425 is 0.017647 M. So ratio is 0.005882 /
