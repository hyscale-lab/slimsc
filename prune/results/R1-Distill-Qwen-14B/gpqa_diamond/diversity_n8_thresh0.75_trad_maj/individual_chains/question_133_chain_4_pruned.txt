Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let's see what it's about. The question involves finding the concentration of orthophosphate ions in a solution that contains two different phosphates: KH2PO4 and Na2HPO4·2H2O. Hmm, I remember that phosphate can exist in different forms depending on the pH, so I need to think about how these salts will dissociate in solution.

First, I should probably write down the given information. The volume of the solution is 200.00 cm³, which is 0.2 liters. Both KH2PO4 and Na2HPO4·2H2O are present at 1.00 grams each. Their molar masses are given as 136.09 g/mol and 177.99 g/mol, respectively. The temperature is 25 °C, but I'm not sure if that affects anything here. Oh wait, the problem also provides the Ka values for H3PO4: Ka1 is 7.5e-3, Ka2 is 6.2e-8, and Ka3 is 1.8e-12. Right, these are the dissociation constants that will help me find the pH of the solution because the phosphate species depend on the pH.

So, the main goal is to find the concentration of orthophosphate ions, which I think is HPO4^2-. Wait, no, orthophosphate is H3PO4, but in solution, it dissociates. Let me double-check. Oh, wait, I'm getting confused. Orthophosphate is H3PO4, but when it loses a proton, it becomes H2PO4^- (the dihydrogen phosphate ion), then HPO4^2-, and finally PO4^3-. So the question is about the concentration of orthophosphate ions, which probably refers to HPO4^2-.

Wait, no, sometimes orthophosphate refers to the H3PO4 molecule itself, but in solution, it's going to dissociate. Hmm. Maybe I should approach this by first figuring out the concentration of each salt in the solution and then considering their dissociation.

So, let's calculate the mo
