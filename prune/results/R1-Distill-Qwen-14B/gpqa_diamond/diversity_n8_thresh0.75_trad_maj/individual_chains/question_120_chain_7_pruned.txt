Okay, so I've got this question about stars and their distribution in the sky. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my astronomy, but let's try to think it through.

The question says that stars are uniformly distributed, which I think means they're spread out evenly in all directions without any particular pattern. The key is to figure out how the number of stars per unit range of parallax (plx) changes with plx.

Wait, parallax is a measure of how far away a star is. Right, the formula for parallax is plx (in arcseconds) equals 1 divided by distance in parsecs. So plx = 1/d. That means as distance increases, parallax decreases.

But the problem is about the number of stars per unit plx. Oh, so like, if I pick a range of plx, say from plx to plx + dplx, how many stars are there in that range?

Stars are uniformly distributed, so their number density is constant. Number density is stars per unit volume. But when you look at a certain direction, like along the line of sight, the number you see depends on how much volume is there at a given distance.

Wait, I remember that when you consider volume in spherical shells, the volume of a shell at distance d with thickness dd is 4πd²
