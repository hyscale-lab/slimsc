Okay, so I've got this question about stars and their distribution in the sky. Hmm, let me think through this. The question says, assuming stars are uniformly distributed, how does the number of stars per unit range of parallax (plx) change with plx?

I remember that parallax is related to the distance of a star. Oh right, parallax (in arcseconds) is inversely proportional to distance in parsecs. So a star with a larger parallax is closer to us. So when plx increases, the distance decreases.

Now, the problem is about the number of stars per unit of parallax. I think this relates to how the density of stars changes with distance, but wait, the stars are uniformly distributed. Oh, wait, uniform distribution in what sense? If they're uniformly distributed in space, that means the number density is constant, so n = N/V, where N is total stars and V is volume.

But wait, parallax is a function of distance. So we need to find how the number of stars in a thin shell (at a certain distance) relates to the parallax. Let me see. The number of stars in a thin shell would be proportional to the surface area of the shell and the thickness in distance. But since stars are uniformly distributed in space, the number in a volume element dV is constant.

Wait, let's model this. Let's say the number of stars in a small volume dV is n * dV, where n is the number density. dV is the volume element. For a spherical shell at distance r, the volume element would be 4πr² dr. So the number of stars in a shell at radius r with thickness dr is n * 4π r² dr.

But parallax plx is related to r. Parallax plx (in arcseconds) = 1 / r (in parsecs). So r = 1/plx. Let me write
