Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through step by step. The question is about identifying a compound based on its IR and NMR data, and then determining the product after a reaction with red phosphorus and HI.

First, let me look at the IR data given. The IR peaks are at 3400–2500 cm-1, 1720 cm-1, 1610 cm-1, 1450 cm-1. I remember that the broad region between 3400 and 2500 cm-1 usually indicates O-H or N-H stretches. Since this is an organic compound and not amines, maybe it's an alcohol or a carboxylic acid. But wait, the 1720 cm-1 peak is a strong carbonyl (C=O) stretch. That could be a ketone, aldehyde, ester, or carboxylic acid.

Looking at the NMR data now. The 1H NMR shows several signals. Let's break them down:

- 10.5 ppm (bs, 1H): A broad singlet around 10 ppm is characteristic of an -OH proton in a carboxylic acid. Because the integration is 1H, maybe it's an aromatic carboxylic acid, like benzoic acid. But wait, the IR had a peak at 1720, which is about the right region for a carboxylic acid (though sometimes lower, like around 1700 for esters and higher for aldehydes). Alternatively, maybe an ester or ketone.

Wait, but the broad peak at 10.5 could be an -OH group, so maybe the compound is a phenol. But phenols typically have O-H stretches around 3300-3000 cm-1, which is in the 3400–2500 region. So that's possible, but the presence of the 1720 cm-1 suggests another functional group, like a carbonyl.

Looking at the NMR shifts:

- 8.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.2 ppm (d, 2H): These are typical of a substituted benzene ring, probably para-substituted. The two doublets suggest two sets of protons, each as doublets, which are likely on a para-substituted aromatic ring. So something like para-substituted benzene.

- 2.9 ppm (m, 1H): This is a multiplet for a CH group. Maybe a CH next to a carbonyl, like in a ketone, or perhaps a CH adjacent to an oxygen.

- 1.7 ppm (m, 2H): Multiplet integrating to 2H. Could be adjacent to a carbonyl or maybe part of an ethyl group.
