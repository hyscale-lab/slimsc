Okay, so I've got this question about a scientific experiment involving gene constructs and protein expression. Hmm, I need to figure it out step by step.

Alright, let's read the scenario. The researcher is working with a ligand-receptor pair expressed in neural crest cells. They want to study their developmental fate. 

The receptor is a monomeric transmembrane protein with eight alpha helices, four extracellular and some beta sheets for binding. The ligand is a coiled-coil with two alpha helices. 

They made a bicistronic lox-Cre vector. Bicistronic means two genes in one vector. The ligand's ORF is at the 5' end, fused to mCherry, and the receptor is at the 3', fused to eGFP. The ligand is under the CBA promoter, and the receptor has an IRES upstream. 

There are stop cassettes: ligand has loxP-stop-loxP before mCherry and the receptor has lox2272-stop-lox2272 before eGFP.

They made antibodies against the proteins and did a Western blot. But when they breed mice homozygous for the construct, crossed with SOX10-Cre, and looked for GFP under the confocal, there was no green signal.

Wait, no green signal. The eGFP is supposed to be expressed under certain conditions. Why isn't it showing up?

Looking at the options:

Option A: Ligand and receptor are paracrine. Paracrine means they act on nearby cells. But if they're both expressed in the same cells, they might be autocrine. But how does that relate to the construct not expressing eGFP? Maybe not directly.

Option B: Receptor-eGFP stuck in Golgi. I'm not sure. If the eGFP is not secreted, but the receptor is a transmembrane protein, it should be on the cell surface. If stuck in Golgi, it might not be expressed on the surface, so no fluorescence. But why wouldn't the Western blot pick up the protein? Because the blot would detect the presence regardless of location. So maybe this isn't it.

Option C: Missing enhancer. The ligand is under CBA promoter, which is a strong promoter, I think. The receptor uses IRES. If the enhancer is missing, maybe the expression isn't happening. But when they did the Western blot after transfection, they saw signals proportional to actin. So the construct is expressed. So maybe in the mice, the expression is not happening because of an enhancer? Wait, but the vector uses CBA for ligand and IRES for receptor. Maybe the IRES isn't sufficient for expression in the right cells? Or perhaps the promoter is only active in certain tissues, but the question says the neural crest cells are where they're expressed. Hmm, but the mice are being crossed with SOX10-Cre, which is a neural crest cell-specific Cre. So the construct is under the control of a Cre-dependent system?

Wait, wait, the vector structure: the ligand is under CBA promoter, which is a strong constitutive promoter. The receptor is after IRES, which is usually internal ribosome entry siteâ€”so the ligand is translated first, then the receptor? Oh wait, the vector is bicistronic, so the two ORFs are in the same transcript, driven by the same promoter. The CBA promoter drives the ligand, then the IRES allows the receptor to be translated. So the ligand and receptor are co-expressed. 

But wait, how are the stop cassettes arranged. The ligand has a stop with loxP, so without Cre, the mCherry would not be expressed because the stop is in the way. But with Cre, the loxP would excise the stop, allowing mCherry to be expressed. Similarly, the receptor has a lox2272 stop cassette. So without Cre, the eGFP is not expressed. So when Cre is present (like in SOX10-Cre mice), it would excise the stop cassettes.
