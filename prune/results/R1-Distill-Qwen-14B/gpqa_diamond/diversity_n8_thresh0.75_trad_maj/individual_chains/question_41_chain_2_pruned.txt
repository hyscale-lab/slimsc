Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the speed of light in a moving medium. Hmm, let's see. The question says that a light beam is propagating through a glass with index of refraction n. The glass itself is moving at a constant velocity v in the same direction as the beam and towards the observer in the lab. The question is asking what the speed of light in the glass is relative to the observer.

Wait a second, I remember that when dealing with light in moving media, it's a bit tricky because of the refractive index and the movement. I think the index of refraction comes into play because it affects the speed of light. Oh right, the speed of light in a medium is c divided by n, so v_light = c/n. But wait, the glass is moving, so does that change things?

I'm a bit confused here about reference frames. The glass is moving relative to the lab frame. So, from the lab's perspective, the glass is moving, but the light is inside the glass. So how does the glass's motion affect the observed speed of light?

Oh, maybe I should consider the relativistic velocity addition formula because velocities don't just add linearly when approaching speeds near the speed of light. Wait, but the problem states that the speed of light in vacuum is c=1. So, units are in terms where c=1, which is convenient.

Wait, but the velocity v of the glass is in the same direction as the light. So from the lab frame, the glass is moving towards the observer, and the light is moving in the same direction as the glass. So the light's speed as observed in the lab would be different than the speed in the glass's frame.

No, wait, the speed of light in the medium is v_light = 1/n (since c=1). So in the glass's rest frame, the light is moving at 1/n. But when the glass is moving, how does that translate to the lab frame?

I think I need to use the relativistic velocity transformation. The formula for velocity addition in special relativity is u' = (u + v) / (1 + uv), where u is the velocity in the original frame and v is the relative velocity between the frames. Wait, but direction matters. If the glass is moving towards the observer, and the light is moving in the same direction as the glass, then from the lab's frame, the light's velocity would be adjusted accordingly.

Wait, let me think again. The glass is moving at velocity v in the same direction as the light. So in the glass's rest frame, the light is moving at speed 1/n. Then, from the lab
