Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem in front of me. Hmm, let me try to understand what it's asking. So, the problem is about finding the uncertainty in the P_z operator, denoted as ΔP_z. 

Alright, the setup is that the system is in an eigenstate of P_x with eigenvalue -ħ. The state vector is given as a column vector with elements (-1/2, 1/√2, -1/2). The matrices for P_x, P_y, and P_z are provided, and the basis vectors are the eigenvectors of P_z. 

Wait, so the basis is the eigenbasis of P_z, which means that in this basis, P_z is diagonal. Because the eigenvectors of P_z are the basis vectors, representing the state in this basis is straightforward. 

I remember that the uncertainty in an operator is calculated using the formula: ΔP_z = sqrt(⟨P_z²⟩ - ⟨P_z⟩²). So I need to find the expectation values of P_z and P_z squared.

First, let me note down the state vector. The given state is a column vector:

|ψ> = [ -1/2 ; 1/√2 ; -1/2 ]

So, the first element is -1/2, the second is 1/sqrt(2), and the third is -1/2. 

The operator P_z is given as a matrix. Let me write it down:

P_z = [ [ ħ, 0, 0 ],
          [ 0, 0, 0 ],
          [ 0, 0, -ħ ] ]

Wait, so P_z is a diagonal matrix with elements ħ, 0, -ħ along the diagonal. Since the state is expressed in the eigenbasis of P_z, each component of the state corresponds to an eigenvalue of P_z. 

Wait, that makes sense because if the basis vectors are eigenvectors of P_z, then when you represent a state in this basis, each component is the amplitude for that eigenstate. So, the first component of |ψ> is the amplitude for the eigenstate with eigenvalue ħ, the second component is for eigenvalue 0, and the third is for eigenvalue -ħ.

But wait, how about the expectation value of P_z? The expectation value ⟨P_z⟩ is the sum of the probabilities multiplied by their respective eigenvalues. 

Since the state is already in the eigenbasis
