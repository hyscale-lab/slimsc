Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem in front of me. Hmm, let's see what it's about. Alright, the question is about identifying the chemical formula of a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring compound. The question gives information from the FTIR and 1H NMR spectra, and some options to choose from.

First, I'll start by breaking down the information given. The FTIR shows absorption peaks indicating an ester group. Esters have a carbonyl group (C=O), which typically shows up around 1700-1750 cm⁻¹. So that's one functional group in the molecule.

Now, looking at the 1H NMR data. It says there are six signals. Let's parse each part:

1. Two signals corresponding to aromatic-H. Since it's a di-substituted benzene ring, the aromatic protons would typically show up as multiple signals depending on their substitution pattern. For example, para substitution would give two sets of equivalent protons, while ortho would have more signals. Wait, but here it's two signals, each for aromatic H. So maybe it's a para substitution because that would split the ring into two equivalent sets of protons. Alternatively, if it's meta, the substitution would lead to a different splitting. Or perhaps it's symmetrical in some way. I'll keep that in mind.

2. Two signals corresponding to vinyl-H. One is a doublet, the other a doublet of quartets. Vinyl protons are typically deshielded and appear around 4.5-7 ppm. The two signals suggest two different types of vinyl protons. A doublet could be from a trans coupling, and a doublet of quartets might be from a vinyl group adjacent to something else. Wait, maybe a conjugated system or part of an ester group? Like a vinyl group attached to an ester.

3. Two signals corresponding to –CH3 groups. Each as singlets? Or maybe as quartets or something else. Since there are two sets, perhaps they're in different environments. Like if the molecule has two separate methyl groups attached to different parts of the structure. But wait, the problem says there are two signals for –CH3, but no –CH2 groups. So the molecule doesn't have any methylene groups (CH2) but has two methyl groups.

Putting this together, the molecule has a benzene ring with two substituents, one of which is an ester group. Ester groups have the structure R-O-C-O-R, so maybe the substituent is an ester like O-CO-O-R. Wait, no, the ester group is O-CO-O-R attached as a substituent. Or perhaps it's a vinyl ester, like a styrene-type structure where the ester is attached to a benzene ring via a vinyl group.

Wait, the NMR shows vinyl-H, so maybe the substituent is a vinyl group attached to an ester. Let me think: Suppose the benzene ring has a substituent that is an ester connected via a vinyl group. So something like benzene-O-CO-O-R, but that doesn't have a vinyl group. Alternatively, maybe it's a substituted acrylate or something like that.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a group like -CH2COO-R, but then there would be CH2 groups. Wait, but the NMR says there are no CH2 signals. Hmm, so that can't be. So maybe the substituent is a vinyl ester, like -CH2CH2COO-R? No, that would have CH2 groups. Alternatively, perhaps a benzyl ester, but that's a single bond.

Wait, maybe the substituent is a propenoate ester. For example, the substituent could be -CH2COOR, but no, that would have CH2 groups. Hmm, this is a bit confusing. Let me think differently.

The presence of an ester group (from IR) suggests that the substituent is an ester. So the substituent is something like O-CO-O-R attached to the ring. Wait, but how? Let's say the di-substituted benzene has two substituents, one being an ester group, maybe as an O-substituent. So like O-CO-O-R attached to the ring. But that would be an ester group as an ether, which might not fit the structure. Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is an acetyl group attached via an oxygen, making it an ester. Wait, but acetyl would be -COO-R attached to the ring as an ester.

Wait, the substituent is -O-CO-O-R, but that would be a carbonate, not an ester. Hmm, perhaps not. Alternatively, maybe the substituent is a benzoyl group, but that's not an ester. Wait, an ester is a group where an alcohol's -OH is replaced by an OR group, so the general structure is RCOOR'.

Suppose one substituent is a carbonyl group, like a ketone, but the IR indicated ester, so I think that's not the case. So perhaps one substituent is a carbonyl ester, like -COOR.

Wait, so the benzene has two substituents: one being -COOR (ester group), and another substituent which must account for the vinyl and methyl groups.

Alternatively, maybe one substituent is a vinyl group attached to an ester. Like, the substituent is -CH2COOR, but then that would have CH2 groups, which the NMR says there are none. Hmm, that's a problem.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a vinyl ester, like -CH₂CH₂COO-R. But again, that would have CH2 groups, but the NMR doesn't show any. So maybe the substituent is a simple ester group, like -COOCH2R? Not sure.

Wait, let's think about the number of signals. The NMR has six signals in total.

- Two aromatic H signals: let's say each is a pair of
