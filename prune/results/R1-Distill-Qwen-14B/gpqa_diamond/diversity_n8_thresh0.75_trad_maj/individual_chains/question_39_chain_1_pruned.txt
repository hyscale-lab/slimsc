Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Hmm, let's see. The question is about finding the value of 'a' in the wave function of a particle. Alright, I remember that in quantum mechanics, the wave function's square gives the probability density. So the first thing that comes to mind is normalization. Because the total probability of finding the particle somewhere must be 1, right?

The wave function given is (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i. Wait, but when you square the magnitude, the imaginary part would affect it. Oh wait, actually, the wave function is a complex function. The probability density is the square of the absolute value of the wave function. So I need to calculate |ψ(x)|² and then integrate it over the region where the particle exists, which is between x=1 and x=3.

Wait, but the way the question is phrased, the wave function is given as (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i. So ψ(x) = (a/sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i. So the real part is a/sqrt(1+x), and the imaginary part is -0.5. 

So the absolute square would be [a²/(1+x)] + (0.5)², because (real part)^2 + (imaginary part)^2. So |ψ|² = (a²)/(1+x) + 0.25.

But wait, is that correct? Because in general, ψ = A + iB, so |ψ|² = A² + B². So yeah,
