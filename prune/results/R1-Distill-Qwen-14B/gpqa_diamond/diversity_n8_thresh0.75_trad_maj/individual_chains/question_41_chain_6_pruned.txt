Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about light moving through a glass medium, and the glass itself is moving. Hmm, I remember that when dealing with light moving through different media, the index of refraction comes into play. The index of refraction, n, is the ratio of the speed of light in a vacuum to its speed in the medium. So normally, the speed of light in the medium is c/n, where c is the speed of light in a vacuum.

But wait, the glass is moving with velocity v relative to the laboratory frame. So I think I need to consider how the motion of the medium affects the speed of light as observed in the lab. Oh right, this probably has to do with the addition of velocities, maybe using special relativity? But wait, the speeds here are probably non-relativistic since the problem isn't giving any indication of relativistic speeds. So maybe I can use the Galilean transformation for velocity addition.

Let me think: when the medium is moving, the speed of light as observed in the lab frame would be the speed inside the medium plus the speed of the medium, but I'm not sure if it's just a simple addition. Alternatively, in special relativity, the velocity addition formula is different, but since the problem doesn't specify anything about high speeds, perhaps it's assuming non-relativistic speeds. I'm a bit confused here.

Wait, the light is propagating through the glass in the same direction as the glass is moving. So let's break it down. The speed of light in the glass relative to the glass is c/n, right? Because when the glass isn't moving, the light's speed is c/n. But now the glass is moving at velocity v in the
