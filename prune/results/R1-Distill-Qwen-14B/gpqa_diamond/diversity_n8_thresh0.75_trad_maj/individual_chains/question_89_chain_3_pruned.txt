Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here, right? It's about a series of reactions starting from 1,3-dibromoadamantane. Hmm, I remember adamantane is a diamondoid structure, a pretty rigid molecule. So dibrominated on the 1 and 3 positions.

The first step is heating with excess KOH at 240°C, creating a light yellow solid product 1. The NMR data given is: 4.79 ppm (2H), 2.41-2.23 ppm (10H), 1.94 ppm (2H). And the IR has a peak at 1720 cm⁻¹. Wait, IR peaks around 1720 usually indicate a carbonyl group, like a ketone or maybe an ester or something else.

So, the reaction of 1,3-dibromoadamantane with KOH. Since KOH is a strong base, this might be an elimination reaction. But wait, if both bromines are on adjacent carbons (given 1 and 3 positions in adamantane are probably adjacent?), maybe it's a double elimination. Alternatively, it could be a dehydrohalogenation, leading to a diene or something. But wait, the product is a solid, and the NMR shows a peak at 4.79 ppm. That's around where an alcohol's OH might show, but it's a singlet for 2H—maybe it's an ether? Or perhaps an epoxide? No, wait, the IR has a carbonyl. Oh, maybe it's a ketone. Alternatively, maybe it's a diol? But then the IR wouldn't have a carbonyl.

Wait, another thought: when two vicinal bromides (like 1,3-dibromoadamantane might be) react with a strong base like KOH, maybe they undergo a double elimination to form a ketone. Wait, but in what structure? Or perhaps it's a Hofmann elimination, but that usually gives alkenes. Alternatively, maybe it's a Dieckmann cyclization, but that's for esters.

Wait, another possibility: when 1,3-dibromoadamantane is treated with KOH, it could form a gem-diol. But that would give an alcohol, not a carbonyl. Hmm, maybe it's an E2 elimination. Wait, but with two bromines, maybe they both eliminate, forming a double bond or a diene. But again, the NMR and IR are pointing towards a carbony
