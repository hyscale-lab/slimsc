Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm going to try to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question says.

The problem is about identifying a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring compound. They've given some spectroscopic data: the FTIR shows ester groups, so that means there's an ester functional group present. Then, the 1H NMR spectrum has six signals. Let me break down what each part tells me.

First, the aromatic ring is di-substituted, so there are two substituents attached to the benzene ring. The ring itself is six-membered, so it's probably a benzene ring. Since it's di-substituted, the substituents can be in adjacent positions (ortho), across from each other (para), or next to adjacent (meta). But without more info, I'll have to think about how the substituents affect the NMR signals.

The FTIR has ester peaks. Ester groups usually show a strong absorption around 1700-1750 cm^-1, which corresponds to the carbonyl (C=O) stretch. So the compound has an ester group, which is R-O-CO-O-R or more likely an ester like R-O-CO-R'. Or wait, no, esters are usually RCOOR', right? So the structure would have an ester group attached to the ring.

Now looking at the 1H NMR:

- Six signals in total.
- Two aromatic protons: so the ring must have some symmetry, causing equivalent protons. For example, if the substituents are para, the ring would have two sets of equivalent protons. Like, in para-substituted benzene, each substituent is opposite, so the ring has two equivalent protons on each adjacent carbon, leading to two sets of aromatic signals. Wait, but wait: a benzene ring with two substituents could have different splitting. Let me think: if the substituents are para, the ring would have two sets of two equivalent protons each, but maybe they split into different signals depending on the substituents.

Wait, the problem says two signals corresponding to aromatic-H. So each signal is a group of equivalent protons. So perhaps the substituents are in such a way that the ring has two distinct sets of aromatic protons. For example, if the substituents are at the para positions, each substituent would cause the adjacent protons to split into two sets. Wait, maybe it's better to think of a substituent that makes some protons equivalent and others not.

Alternatively, maybe the substituents are such that the ring has two types of aromatic protons. Like, perhaps one substituent is an ester group, and the other is something else. Or both substituents are ester groups?

Wait, no, because the compound is di-substituted, so two substituents. So each substituent would be a group attached to the ring. One could be an ester group, but wait, ester is an alkoxy carbonyl group. So perhaps one substituent is an ester (like OCOOR) and the other substituent is something else.

Wait, but maybe the substituents are both ester groups? Or perhaps each substituent is a different group, with one being an ester.

Wait, the compound's formula is either C11H12O2, C11H14O2, C12H12O2, or C12H14O2. Let's think about the molecular formula. The ester group is OCOOR, which is O=C-O-R. So that contributes to the oxygen count.

So the formula would have two oxygen atoms from the ester, perhaps. Or maybe there's another oxygen elsewhere. But the question says the FTIR shows an ester, so perhaps the compound has an ester group and no other oxygen, so O count is 2.

Wait, the options have O2, so that's two oxygen atoms. So the compound has an ester group and possibly another oxygen-containing group, but perhaps not. Wait, no, the ester group itself has two oxygen atoms (O and O in the carbonyl and the ester oxygen). So if the compound only has an ester group, that's two O's. But maybe there's another oxygen elsewhere.

Wait, but the options all have O2, so the formula is O2.

Now, looking at the NMR:

- Two aromatic H signals: so the ring must have two sets of equivalent protons. This suggests that the substituents are either para (so each substituent is opposite each other), leading to two sets of equivalent H on the ring. Alternatively, if the substituents are meta, perhaps there are more signals. Or if they're ortho, perhaps the ring protons are split into more signals.

Wait, for a para-substituted benzene with two substituents, each substituent is across from each other. Then, the ring would have two sets of equivalent H. For example, in para-dimethylbenzene (para-xylene), the two substituents are in para positions, so the H adjacent to each substituent are equivalent, leading to two sets of H. So the NMR would show two signals for aromatic H.

So that seems to fit the NMR data.

Next, the NMR shows two signals corresponding to vinyl-H. Vinyl protons are typically the H attached to a double bond, like in an alkene or an aromatic ring. But wait, in this case, since the ring is aromatic, the ring's H are already considered. Wait, the vinyl H must be part of a substituent. So the substituents on the ring might have double bonds.

So, the substituents could be, for example, an ester group (RCOOR') and another group that has a vinyl group. Alternatively, one substituent is an ester and the other is an ethyl group, but that doesn't explain the vinyl H.

Wait, looking again, the NMR shows two signals for vinyl-H: one doublet and one doublet of quartets. So these are likely to be part of a double bond structure, perhaps in a substituent. For example, if one substituent is a vinyl group, perhaps part of an ester.

Alternatively, maybe one substituent is a propenyl ester or something similar.

Wait, perhaps the substituents are an ester group and a vinyl group. Or maybe each substituent has a double bond.

Alternatively, perhaps one substituent is an ester, and the other substituent is a substituent that has a vinyl group, like a substituent that's an alkene.

Wait, but what's a di-substituted benzene with substituents that include an ester and a vinyl group? Alternatively, perhaps the substituents are both ester groups, but that seems unlikely. Or perhaps the substituents are an ester and another group with
