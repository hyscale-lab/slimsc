Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the speed of light in a moving medium. Hmm, let's try to break it down. I remember something about the index of refraction and how it affects the speed of light. Wait, the question is about a glass moving at a constant velocity v in the same direction as the light beam. The observer is in the laboratory frame, I think.

Wait, the glass is moving towards the observer, but the light is propagating through the glass in the same direction as the glass's motion. So, the glass is moving toward the observer, but the light is moving in the same direction as the glass's velocity. Wait, that might be a bit confusing. Let me visualize this: imagine the glass is a block moving to the right (toward the observer?) Wait, no, the observer is in the lab, and the glass is moving toward the observer. So the glass is moving towards the observer, and the light is going through the glass in the same direction as the glass's motion. Hmm, so the light is moving to the right, and the glass is moving to the right as well but perhaps not as fast as the light.

Wait, but the speed of light in a medium is c/n, where c is the vacuum speed and n is the index of refraction. So in the glass, the speed of the light relative to the glass would be 1/n, since c is given as 1 here.

But wait, the glass is moving. So I think this is a problem involving relative motion of the medium and the observer. I remember that in special relativity, the speed of light remains c in all inertial frames. Oh wait, but this isn't about special relativity because it's about a medium moving. Wait, but in special relativity, the speed of light doesn't change regardless of the motion of the source or the observer. So in the lab frame, the observer would still measure the light's speed as c, regardless of the glass's motion. But wait, no, because the glass is a medium through which the light is propagating. Hmm, maybe that's a different situation.

Wait, the problem says the glass is moving at a constant velocity v in the same direction as the beam and toward the observer. Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me read the question again. Oh wait, the glass is moving toward the observer in the laboratory. Wait, no: the glass is moving in the same direction as the beam and toward the observer. So if the beam is going in a certain direction, the glass is moving in that same direction. So perhaps the observer is to the left of the glass's direction of motion. Hmm, maybe
