Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The compound has the molecular formula C8H9NO. The NMR data is given, and it's reacted through a series of reagents. I need to figure out the final product and choose the correct option from A to D.

First, I'll look at the NMR data to identify the structure of the starting compound. The 1H-NMR shows several peaks:

- 9.72 ppm (t, 1H): That's a triplet, probably an aldehyde proton. Aldehydes typically show up around 9-10 ppm. The triplet suggests it's coupled with two neighboring protons. Wait, aldehyde protons are usually deshielded and appear as singlets or triplets if adjacent to something. Hmm, but in this case, it's a triplet. Maybe it's an alpha position with two adjacent protons?

- 6.98 ppm (d, 2H): A doublet, probably from aromatic protons. Maybe para-substituted because two protons are equivalent and as a doublet.

- 6.51 ppm (d, 2H): Another doublet, likely from another set of aromatic protons. Also suggests maybe another para-substituted group.

- 6.27 ppm (bs, 2H): Broad singlet, maybe two equivalent protons. Could be from a diene or maybe some other coupling. Also, 'bs' stands for broad singlet, which might indicate exchange with something else, like in a hydroxyl group? Or maybe it's part of a conjugated system.

- 3.66 ppm (d, 2H): A doublet integrating for two protons. That looks like maybe a CH2 group adjacent to an electronegative atom, like oxygen. Oxygen nearby could split the peak into a doublet. So perhaps a group like OCH2 or something similar.

Putting this together, I'm thinking of a structure that has an aldehyde group, aromatic rings, and some substituents. Let me try to sketch a possible structure.

Wait, the molecular formula is C8H9NO. Let's calculate the degree of unsaturation. Degree of unsaturation is (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. So, C=8, H=9, N=1, O=1.

So, (2*8 +2 -9 -1 +1)/2 = (18 -9 -1 +1)/2 = (9)/2 = 4.5? No, wait, wait. Wait, the formula is C8H9NO. So, substituting into the formula:

Each ring or double bond is one degree of unsaturation. Let's compute:

Degrees of unsaturation = (2*8 +2 -9 -1 +1)/2 = (16+2-9-1+1)/2 = (18-9-1+1)=9? Wait wait, let me recalculate:

Wait, correct formula is (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. So for C8H9NO:

C
