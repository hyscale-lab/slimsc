Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of these NMR problems and reaction mechanisms. Let me try to break it down step by step.

The compound has the molecular formula C8H9NO. Hmm, molecular formula... I remember that the degree of unsaturation can help figure out the structure. Let me calculate that. Degree of unsaturation is (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. So for C8H9NO: C is 8, H is9, N is 1, O is 1. Plugging in: (2*8 +2 -9 -1 +1)/2 = (18-9 -1 +1)/2 = (9)/2=4.5? Wait, that's not possible. Oh wait, maybe I made a mistake. Let me recalculate: 2*8 is 16 plus 2 is 18. Minus 9 H: 18-9=9. Minus 1 X (if X is something else, but here O is the heteroatom. Wait, actually, the formula is C8H9NO, so X is O. So maybe the formula is (2C +2 - H + N - X)/2? Or wait, maybe I got the formula wrong. The standard degree of unsaturation is (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. So yeah, for C8H9NO: 2*8=16, +2=18. 18-9=9. Then - X: O is 0 (since X is halogens, maybe?), wait, maybe O doesn't count in the same way. Wait, actually, I think the formula is (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. So if O is present, perhaps it's treated differently. Wait, maybe oxygen doesn't affect the degree of unsaturation. Let me think: Each ring or double bond is a degree of unsaturation. Each triple bond is 2, each ring is 1, etc. O is part of double bonds (like in carbonyl groups), which would account for a degree of unsaturation. So in the formula, O doesn't add an extra degree but is part of one.

So for C8H9NO: C=8, H=9, N=1, O=1. The formula is (2*8 + 2 - 9 +1)/2 because we have N=1 (so add 1) and O? Wait, maybe I should think of it as (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. Since X (halogen) is zero here, so (16+2-9 +1)/2 = (10)/2=5. So 5 degrees of unsaturation. That makes sense. Five degrees could be a benzene ring (3 double bonds + 1 ring, so 4?), plus a carbonyl group (another double bond). Wait, benzene has 3 double bonds and one ring, which counts as 4 degrees. Then a carbonyl adds another, making 5. So that fits.

Looking at the NMR data:
