Okay, so I've got this question about optical isomerism in organic compounds. Hmm, optical isomerism occurs when a compound has chiral centers, right? Chiral centers are atoms, usually carbon, bonded to four different groups. So, if a molecule has such centers, it can have enantiomers, which are non-superimposable mirror images. That's when you get optical activity—like how some compounds rotate plane-polarized light.

Let me look at each of the given compounds one by one.

1. Dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate. Wait, biphenyl rings connected at position 1 and 1'. The substituents are on positions 2 and 6. So, are there any chiral centers here? Each of the carbons attached to the oxygen in the ester groups—is each being connected to four different groups? Each ester is O-CO-OCH3. Let me think—since the biphenyl has substituents in symmetrical positions, but wait, if the substituents are on opposite positions, maybe the molecule isn't symmetrical. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, considering the biphenyl itself, maybe the arrangement of substituents leads to a possibility of being a chiral center. Wait, no, because the biphenyl is connected in such a way that the substituents are symmetrical. Wait, or is it? Wait, the substituents are on the same side? Or opposite? I'm a bit confused. Alternatively, maybe the molecule has a plane of symmetry. If so, then it won't have optical isomerism. Alternatively, if the substituents are arranged in a way that each carbon is connected to four different groups, then it would be chiral. I'm not entirely sure. Let me think again: the structure is 6,6'-dinitro on each ring and 2,2'-dicarboxylate. So, each ring has a nitro group at position 6 and a carboxylate ester at position 2. So, each ring would have substituents. Wait, if the substituents on each ring are in such a way that each ring's substituent positions are symmetrical. Hmm. Maybe the molecule as a whole doesn't have a chiral center because the substituents are symmetrical. Or perhaps if the biphenyl has a certain configuration. Wait, maybe the biphenyl ring could have a certain kind of stereoisomerism. Oh! Wait, biphenyls can have a kind of stereoisomerism called cis-trans. So in this case, if the substituents on each phenyl ring are in a certain arrangement, maybe they can be cis or trans. But wait, for optical isomerism, cis
