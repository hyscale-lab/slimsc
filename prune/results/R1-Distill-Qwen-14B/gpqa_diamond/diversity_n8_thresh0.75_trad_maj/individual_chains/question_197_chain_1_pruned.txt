Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem to solve, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let me see what the question says.

The problem is about identifying the product formed when Compound X reacts with red phosphorus and HI. The options are four different compounds, and they're all substituted benzene derivatives with various substituents.

First, let's look at the data given. The IR and NMR spectra should help me figure out what Compound X is, and then I can determine what happens when it reacts with those reagents.

Starting with the IR data: the peaks are 3400–2500 cm⁻¹, 1720 cm⁻¹, 1610 cm⁻¹, 1450 cm⁻¹. 

Hmm, the broad peak between 3400 and 2500 suggests there might be an -OH group because O-H stretches usually appear in that region. Wait, but another possibility is an amine or an alcohol. But since 1720 cm⁻¹ is a strong carbonyl peak, maybe it's a ketone or ester or something like that. Wait, but if the peak is around 1720, maybe it's a carboxylic acid? Because carboxylic acids have a strong O-H stretch around 2500-3300 (broad) and a carbonyl around 1700. But wait, the IR here has 3400–2500 which is a broad region, possibly O-H. So if it's a carboxylic acid, that would explain the O-H and the 1720. But wait, another possibility is that the 3400–2500 is an alcohol, but then the 1720 would be a ketone or ester.

Wait, another thought: maybe it's a conjugated carbonyl. The peak at 1610 and 1450 cm⁻¹ could be aromatic C=C stretches. So the compound might have an aromatic ring, which fits with the NMR data showing signals around 7-8 ppm.

Looking at the 1H NMR data:

- 10.5 ppm (bs, 1H): That's a strong peak, probably an aldehyde proton, but wait, aldehyde protons are around 9-10 ppm. Alternatively, a carboxylic acid -OH might appear around 10-12, but that's usually a broad peak. But wait, 10.5 could also be a vinylic proton in some conjugated system, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe it's an aromatic proton adjacent to an electron-withdrawing group, like a nitro group, but that's not in the options. Or perhaps it's a phenolic O-H, but in that case, the peak would be broader and perhaps around 5-7 ppm, so 10.5 is probably not a phenol.

Wait, but looking again, the 10.5 ppm is a broad singlet (bs), which could suggest it's not split by neighboring protons. So maybe it's a carboxylic acid proton. Because the O-H in a carboxylic acid is usually a broad peak around 10-12 ppm. But wait, in some cases, if the acid is deprotonated, the O-H might not show up, but the IR has a strong peak in that region, so maybe it's a carboxylic acid.

Wait, but then looking at the other peaks: 8.0 ppm (d, 2H), 7.2 ppm (d, 2H). That's a classic pattern for a para-substituted aromatic ring. Two doublets, each integrating to 2H, suggests that in the benzene ring, there are two sets of protons, each with two H, and they're para to each other. So maybe it's an aromatic ring with substituents at the para positions. For example, a para-substituted benzene with two substituents, each of which is an electron-withdrawing group, causing the neighboring protons to be downfield.

Looking at the substituents, perhaps there's a carbonyl group attached. Because the IR has a 1720 cm⁻¹ peak, which is a strong carbonyl. So maybe the compound is a substituted benzoic acid. So, for example, 4-(something)benzoic acid.

Now, other NMR signals: 2.9 ppm (m, 1H), 1.7 ppm (m, 2H), 1.4 ppm (d, 3H), 0.9 ppm (t, 3H).

Hmm, so the 2.9 ppm is a multiplet integrating to 1H. Then 1.7 ppm is a multiplet for 2H, 1.4 is a doublet (3H), and 0.9 is a triplet (3H). That suggests a chain of carbons attached to the aromatic ring, maybe an alkyl group.

Let me try to sketch this out. The aromatic ring has a substituent at the para position. Let's say it's a substituent attached to the ring, which is linked to a carbonyl group. Wait, but in the options, some are benzoic acids, others are isomers with substituents.

Wait, looking at the options:

Option A: 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid. So that would be a propanoic acid where the aromatic group is attached at
