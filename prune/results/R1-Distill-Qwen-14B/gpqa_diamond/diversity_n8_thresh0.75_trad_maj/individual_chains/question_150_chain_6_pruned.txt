Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me start by reading through the question carefully.

The compound has the molecular formula C8H9NO. Hmm, that's interesting. The NMR data is provided, so I should probably look at that first to figure out the structure.

The NMR data is as follows:
- 9.72 ppm: triplet, 1H
- 6.98 ppm: doublet, 2H
- 6.51 ppm: doublet, 2H
- 6.27 ppm: broad singlet, 2H
- 3.66 ppm: doublet, 2H

So, let me try to interpret this. The high ppm value at 9.72 is likely an aldehyde proton, since those usually appear around there. The triplet suggests it's coupled to two other protons. Maybe it's part of a conjugated system?

Looking at the aromatic region: the two doublets at 6.98 and 6.51. Those could be from two sets of aromatic protons, perhaps para-substituted. For example, in a benzene ring with two substituents, each set of equivalent protons would show as a doublet. Wait, but the integration is 2H for each, so perhaps two separate benzene rings each with two protons? Or maybe a single ring with substituents leading to two doublets.

Then there's the broad singlet at 6.27 ppm for 2H. Broad usually suggests something exchangeable, like an -OH group. But wait, 2H as a singlet? Maybe it's adjacent to something, like in a conjugated system. Could it be part of a vinyl group, like =CH-OH? Or maybe adjacent to an oxygen, like an enol form or something.

The 3.66 ppm doublet for 2H might be a CH2 group next to an electronegative atom, perhaps oxygen. Maybe an OCH2 group or something like that. The doublet suggests coupling with one neighboring group.

Putting this together, maybe the structure has an aldehyde group (from the 9.72 triplet), two benzene rings (from the two doublets in aromatic region), and some sort of conjugated system with an oxygen.

Wait, the molecular formula is C8H9NO. Let me calculate the degree of unsaturation. Degree of unsaturation formula is (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. So for C=8, H=9, N=1, O=1.

So, (2*8 +2 -9 -1 +1)/2 = (18 -9 -1 +1)/2 = (9)/2 = 4.5? Wait, that can't be. Maybe I miscalculated. Let me redo.

Wait, formula: Degree of Unsaturation (DoU) = (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2.

So, C=8, H=9, X=0, N=1, O=1.

So 2*8 =16. 16+2=18. 18 -9=
