Okay, so I have this physics problem here about finding the kinetic energy of the product particles in a decay process. Let me try to understand what's going on. The problem states that a Pi(+) pion is at rest and decays into a mu(+) muon and a neutrino. The given masses are Pi(+) is 139.6 MeV and mu(+) is 105.7 MeV. I need to find the kinetic energies of the products, which are the muon and the neutrino.

Hmm, I remember that in particle physics, when a particle at rest decays, the total energy and momentum must be conserved. Since the pion is at rest, its momentum is zero, so the total momentum of the decay products must also be zero. That means the muon and the neutrino must have equal and opposite momenta. But wait, neutrinos are tricky because they have very little mass, almost massless, right? So I think their momentum would be much larger compared to the muon's.

Let me think about energy conservation. The total energy before decay is just the rest mass energy of the pion, which is 139.6 MeV. After decay, the total energy is the sum of the energies of the muon and the neutrino. The energy of each particle is the sum of their rest mass energy and kinetic energy. But neutrinos are considered to be massless in many approximations, so their energy would just be their kinetic energy.

Wait, but the muon does have rest mass. So, let me jot down the equations. Let me denote the energies:

E_mu = gamma * m_mu * c^2
E_nu = K_nu + m_nu * c^2

But since the neutrino's mass is negligible, E_nu ≈ K_nu.

Conservation of energy says E_pi = E_mu + E_nu.

Also, conservation of momentum: since the pion is at rest, the vector sum of the momenta of muon and neutrino is zero. So, p_mu = -p_nu in magnitude. But for a relativistic particle, p = gamma * m * v. Since the neutrino is almost massless, its momentum is approximately E_nu / c. And for the muon, p_mu = gamma * m_mu * v.

Wait, maybe I should approach this with four-momentum. The four-momentum of the pion is (E_pi, 0) because it's at rest. The four-momentum of the muon and neutrino must add up to that.

The invariant mass squared is (E_total)^2 - (p_total c)^2. But since p_total is zero, it's just E_total^2 = (m_pi c^2)^2.

Alternatively, perhaps I can consider the decay in the center of mass frame, which is the same as the pion's rest frame.

Another approach is to consider the energy and momentum conservation equations.

Let me denote the following variables:

m_pi = 139.6 MeV/c²
m_mu = 105.7 MeV/c²
m_nu ≈ 0 (treated as massless)

Let me denote the energies of muon and neutrino as E_mu and E_nu, and their momenta as p_mu and p_nu. Since they're moving in opposite directions, their momenta vectors are equal in magnitude and opposite in direction. So, the vector sum is zero.

So, from conservation of energy:

E_mu + E_nu = m_pi c² = 139.6 MeV

From conservation of momentum:

p_mu = p_nu (since direction is opposite, but magnitude same)

But E = sqrt( (pc)^2 + (m c²)^2 )

So, for muon:
E_mu = sqrt( (p_mu c)^2 + (m_mu c²)^2 )

For neutrino, since m_nu ≈ 0:
E_nu = p_nu c

But since p_mu = p_nu, we can write E_nu = p_mu c.

So, substituting into the energy equation:

sqrt( (p_mu c)^2 + (m_mu c²)^2 ) + p_mu c = m_pi c²

Let me divide both sides by c² to make it simpler. Let me set c=1 for simplicity in units where c=1.

So, sqrt( (p_mu)^2 + (m_mu)^2 ) + p_mu = m_pi

Let me denote x = p_mu.

So, equation becomes sqrt(x² + m_mu²) + x = m_pi

Subtract x from both sides:

sqrt(x² + m_mu²) = m_pi - x

Square both sides:

x² + m_mu² = (m_pi - x)^2 = m_pi² - 2 m_pi x + x²

Subtract x² from both sides:

m_mu² = m_pi² - 2 m_pi x

Rearranged:

2 m_pi x = m_pi² - m_mu²

So,

x = [ m_pi² - m_mu² ] / (2 m_pi )

Let me compute that. m_pi is 139.6, m_mu is 105.7.

m_pi squared: 139.6^2 ≈ (Let me compute 140^2=19600, subtract 0.4*2*140 + 0.4^2) → 139.6^2 = (140 - 0.4)^2 = 140² - 2*140*0.4 + 0.4² = 19600 - 112 + 0.16 = 19488.16 MeV².

m_mu squared: 105.7^2. Let's compute that. 100^2=10000, 5.7^2=32.49, and cross terms 2*100*5.7=1140. So, (100+5.7)^2 = 10000 + 1140 + 32.49 = 11172.49 MeV².

So,

m_pi² - m_mu² = 19488.16 - 11172.49 = 8315.67 MeV².

Divide by 2 * m_pi = 2 * 139.6 = 279.2 MeV.

x = 8315.67 / 279.2 ≈ let's compute that.

279.2 * 29.7 ≈ let me see.

Wait, 279.2 * 30 = 8376. So 8315.67 is about 8376 - 60. So 30 - (60/279.2) ≈ 30 - 0.215 ≈ 29.785. So approximately x ≈ 29.785 MeV/c.

Wait, no, wait. Because x is p_mu, the momentum of the muon. So p_mu ≈ 29.785 MeV/c.

Then, E_nu = p_mu c = x (since c=1, E_nu is x, but wait I'm using units where c=1, so E_nu is in MeV. So E_nu ≈ 29.785 MeV.

Then, E_mu is sqrt(x² + m_mu²) → sqrt( (29.785)^2 + (105.7)^2 )

Compute 29.785^2 ≈ 887 (since 30^2=900, so approx 887).

105.7^2=11172.49.

So 887 + 11172.49 ≈ 12059.49. sqrt of that is approx 109.81 MeV.

Wait, 109.81 squared is approx 12059? Hmm, 109.8^2 is (110 - 0.2)^2 = 12100 - 2*110*0.2 + 0.04 = 12100 - 44 + 0.04 → 12056.04. Our sum is 12059.49, so sqrt is about 109.81 MeV.

So E_mu ≈ 109.81 MeV, and E_nu ≈ 29.785 MeV.

But wait, the total energy is 109.81 + 29.785 ≈ 139.595 MeV, which is close to m_pi (139.6), so that checks out.

Now, the kinetic energy is the total energy minus rest mass energy.

So K_mu = E_mu - m_mu c² = 109.81 MeV - 105.7 MeV = 4.11 MeV.

And K_nu = E_nu (since m_nu is zero) → approx 29.785 MeV.

Looking at the options:

Option D says 4.12 MeV and 29.8 MeV. That's very close to what I calculated.

Wait, but let me double-check my numbers more accurately.

Compute m_pi²: 139.6².

139.6 * 139.6: let me compute it step by step.

139.6 * 100 = 13960

139.6 * 30 = 4188

139.6 * 9 = 1256.4

139.6 * 0.6 = 83.
