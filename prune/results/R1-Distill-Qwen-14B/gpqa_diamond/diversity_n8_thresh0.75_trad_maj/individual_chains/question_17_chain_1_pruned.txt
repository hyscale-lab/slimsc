Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm not exactly sure how to approach it, but I'll try to think it through. The question is about finding the concentration of calcium ions in a solution where a Ca-EDTA complex is present. Let me see what details I can gather.

The problem states that the solution contains 0.02 M of the stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex. The pH is ideal, so I don't have to worry about that complicating things. The formation constant, K for the Ca-EDTA complex, is given as 5x10^10. The options are various concentrations, so I need to calculate which one is correct.

Hmm, I remember that EDTA forms complexes with metal ions, and the formation constant (K) is a measure of the stability of the complex. A higher K means the complex is more stable. But how does this relate to the concentration of free Ca²+ ions in solution?

I think the key here is the concept of the formation constant and how it relates to the concentrations of the ions involved. The Ca-EDTA complex is CaY²−, where Y is the EDTA^4−. The formation of the complex can be represented by the equation:

Ca²+ + EDTA^4− ⇌ CaEDTA²−

The formation constant K is given by K = [CaEDTA²−]/([Ca²+][EDTA^4−])

Wait, but in this problem, the concentration of the Ca-EDTA complex is 0.02 M. So [CaEDTA²−] is 0.02 M. But I also know that EDTA exists in different protonated forms depending on the pH. However, the problem states that the pH is ideal, which I think means that the EDTA is predominantly in the Y^4− form. So I can probably assume that all the EDTA is available as Y^4−, which simplifies the problem.

Wait, but wait a second. The solution contains the Ca-EDTA complex, which is 0.02 M. So that implies that the total concentration of Ca²+ and EDTA in the solution is tied up in that complex. But wait, I'm not sure. Let me think again.

The problem says the solution has 0.02 M of the stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex. So the concentration of the complex is 0.02 M. That would mean that all the calcium and EDTA is in the form of CaY²−? Or is there some free
