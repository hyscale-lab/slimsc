Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is.

So, there are two astronauts. Their masses are 2m and 3m. They're moving at relativistic speeds—0.6c and 0.5c respectively, both in the positive x-direction. The question is asking about their relative speed and the total energy of the system. The options are A to D.

Hmm. Okay, so I remember that when dealing with velocities and energies at relativistic speeds, I have to use the formulas from Einstein's theory of relativity because Newtonian mechanics won't work anymore at such high speeds.

First, let's tackle the relative speed. Wait, relative to which frame? Oh, right, when two objects are moving in the same direction, the relative speed isn't just the difference of their speeds because of the way relativity adds velocities.

The formula for adding velocities in special relativity is (u - v)/(1 - (uv/c²)). But wait, in this case, astronaut A is moving at 0.6c, astronaut B at 0.5c. So if I want the speed of A as seen from B's frame, it's (0.6c - 0.5c)/(1 - (0.6c)(0.5c)/c²). Let me calculate that.

Wait, let me think again. The formula is (u - v) / (1 - (u v)/(c²)). Here, u is the velocity of A (0.6c), and v is the velocity of B (0.5c). So the numerator is 0.6c -0.5c = 0.1c. The denominator is 1 - (0.6c *0.5c)/c². Let's compute that: (0.3c²)/c² = 0.3. So denominator is 1 - 0.3 = 0.7. So the relative speed is 0.1c / 0.7 ≈ 0.1428c, which is approximately 0.14c. So the relative speed is about 0.14c. Looking at the options, options C and D have 0.14c.

Now, the total energy of the system. Hmm. Relativistic energy is given by E = gamma * m c². Gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - (v²/c²)). So I need to compute the
