Okay, so I'm trying to figure out the maximum speed of a relativistic harmonic oscillator. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think. I remember that in classical mechanics, a harmonic oscillator has maximum speed based on amplitude and spring constant. But this is relativistic, so things get more complicated.

Wait, the problem states it's a 1D relativistic harmonic oscillator obeying Hooke's law, F = -kx. The mass is m, amplitude A. We need to find v_max. Oh right, in relativity, the energy considerations change because of the speed limit, c.

In the classical case, the maximum speed is when all potential energy is converted to kinetic energy. The potential energy is (1/2)kA², and the kinetic energy is (1/2)mv². So setting them equal, v_max² = (kA²)/m. So v_max = sqrt(kA²/m), which is option C. But wait, that's the classical answer. Since this is relativistic, the answer should be different.

In relativity, kinetic energy is different. The total energy is gamma m c². The potential energy in a relativistic oscillator... I'm not exactly sure. Maybe the potential energy is still (1/2)kx², but the kinetic energy is the relativistic form, which is (gamma - 1) m c².

Wait, but for a harmonic oscillator, energy is conserved. So the total energy E is the sum of kinetic and potential. At maximum displacement (x=A), the velocity is zero, so all energy is potential. At equilibrium (x=0), the velocity is maximum, so all energy is kinetic.

In the relativistic case, the potential energy U is probably (1/2)k x² as before. The kinetic energy is (gamma - 1) m c². So, when x=A, the potential energy is (1/2)k A². The kinetic is zero, so total energy E = (1/2)k A². But wait, when the mass is
