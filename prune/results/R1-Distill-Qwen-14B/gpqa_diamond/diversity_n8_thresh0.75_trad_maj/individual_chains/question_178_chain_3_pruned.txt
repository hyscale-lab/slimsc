Okay, so I've got this question about a Lagrangian and whether the theory is renormalizable. Hmm, I need to figure this out step by step. Let's start by recalling what I know about Lagrangians and renormalizability.

The given Lagrangian is L_int = κ ψ̄ σ_{μν} ψ F^{μν}. Wait, σ_{μν} is given as (i/2)[γ_μ, γ_ν]. Oh right, those are the antisymmetric products of gamma matrices. And F^{μν} is the field strength tensor, probably from electromagnetism since it's antisymmetric in μ and ν.

So first, I need to find the mass dimension of κ. To do that, I'll think about the dimensions of each term in the Lagrangian. Remember, the Lagrangian must have mass dimension 4 in 4D spacetime so that when you integrate it over four dimensions, the action is dimensionless.

Let me break down each part of the Lagrangian L_int. It's equal to κ multiplied by ψ̄, then σ_{μν}, then ψ, and multiplied by F^{μν}.

I'll list each term and their dimensions:

1. ψ̄: The Dirac spinor has mass dimension 3/2 because in 4D, the Dirac equation is first order. So ψ̄ (same as ψ) has [ψ̄] = 3/2.

2. σ_{μν} is a term involving gamma matrices. Since each γ matrix is dimensionless (they're just matrices, not operators with dimensions), the commutator [γ_μ, γ_ν] is also dimensionless. So σ_{μν} has the same dimension as i/2, which is dimensionless. So [σ_{μν}] = 0.

3. Next, F^{μν} is the field strength tensor. For electromagnetism, F_{μν} is ∂_μ A_ν - ∂_ν A_μ, so each derivative has dimension 1. The gauge field A has dimension 1 (since it's like a vector potential). So each term in F is ∂A, which is dimension 2. So F^{μν} has dimension 2. But wait, wait, in the Lagrangian, F is used as F^{μν}, which is similar to F_{μν} but raised indices. Since the metric is dimensionless, the dimension doesn't change. So [F^{μν}] = 2.

Now, putting it all together. The product is ψ̄ σ ψ F. Wait, let me count the dimensions:

ψ̄: 3/2
σ: 0
ψ: 3/2
F: 2

Multiplying them: (3/2) + 0 + (3/2) + 2 = 3/2 + 3/2 is 3, plus 2 makes 5. So the product ψ̄ σ ψ F has dimension 5.

The Lagrangian L has to have dimension 4 because it's the integrand in
