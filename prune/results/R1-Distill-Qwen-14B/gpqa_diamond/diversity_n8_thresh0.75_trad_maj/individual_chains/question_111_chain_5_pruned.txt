Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry question here, and I need to figure out the right answer. Let's take it step by step.

The question has two parts: reactions A and B. I'll tackle them one by one.

Starting with reaction A: 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one reacting with ethyl acrylate in the presence of t-BuOK. Hmm, t-BuOK is a strong, bulky base, so I think this might be a Claisen or similar condensation reaction. Wait, cyclohexanone derivatives undergoing some kind of addition or substitution?

Wait, cyclohexanone with ethyl acrylate under basic conditions. Oh, wait, maybe it's a Michael addition? Because ethyl acrylate is a Michael acceptor, and the ketone might act as an enolate donor. Or perhaps it's a conjugate addition.

Wait, 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one. Let me draw the structure. The cyclohexanone has substituents: at position 2, an ethyl and a methyl group (since 2-ethyl and 2,6-dimethyl.) Wait, no. Let me think. The numbering might be such that position 1 is the ketone. So the carbonyl is at C1. Then, C2 would have both an ethyl and a methyl group, and C6 has a methyl as well.

So the structure is cyclohexanone with substituents at C1 (carbonyl), C2 (ethyl and methyl), and C6 (methyl). So, positions 2 and 6 are substituted.

When a base like t-BuOK is present, it deprotonates the ketone to form an enolate. The enolate can attack the Michael acceptor (ethyl acrylate). But wait,
