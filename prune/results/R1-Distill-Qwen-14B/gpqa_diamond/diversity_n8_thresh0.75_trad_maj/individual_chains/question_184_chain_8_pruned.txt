Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem to solve. Let me start by understanding what's being asked. The question is about determining the correct sequence of reactions to synthesize 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene starting from benzene.

First, let me draw the structure of the target molecule to visualize it better. The benzene ring has three substituents: a tert-butyl group, an ethoxy group, and a nitro group. The numbering is such that the tert-butyl is at position 2, ethoxy at position 1, and nitro at position 3. Wait, no, benzene is a ring, so the numbering might be a bit tricky. Let me think: the positions should be 1, 2, and 3. So, substituents are at positions 1, 2, and 3. Oh wait, noâ€”actually, the numbering is probably 1, 2, and 3 in a way that the substituents are adjacent or meta, but I'm not entirely sure. Anyway, let's see.

The target is 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene. So, the benzene ring has three substituents: ethoxy at position 1, tert-butyl at 2, and nitro at 3. So, if I imagine the benzene ring with substituents in the 1,2,3 positions, they are adjacent. So that's meta positions? Wait, no, 1,2,3 would be consecutive, so they are adjacent to each other. Hmm, perhaps like 1 being ethoxy, 2 being tert-butyl, and 3 being nitro.

But wait, the problem is about the order of reactions. Each reaction is a substitution or nitration, etc. So I need to plan the synthesis steps correctly.

In aromatic substitution reactions, the order of adding substituents is important because each substituent directs the next incoming group to a specific position. Benzene is initially activated or deactivated by substituents. Nitro groups are meta directors, ethoxy is an activating (ortho/para) director, and tert-butyl is a bulky substituent but an activating group because it's an alkyl group (since it's an electron-donating group).

Wait, no. The tert-butyl group is an activating group because it's an electron-donating alkyl group. So substituents can direct incoming electrophiles either ortho, meta, or para based on their nature.

Let me think about the substituents:

1. Ethoxy group (OCH2CH3) is an activating group (because it's an ether, O- is electron-withdrawing but the lone pairs can activate the ring through resonance, making it an activating group). So ethoxy is an ortho/para director.

2. tert-Butyl group is an activating, alkyl group, which is an ortho/para director.

3. Nitro group is a deactivating, meta director.

So when adding substituents, the order in which they are introduced will affect where the next substituent attaches.

The target molecule has nitro at position 3, ethoxy at 1, and tert-butyl at 2. Alternatively, let's imagine the positions as 1, 2, 3 in a row, each with substituents. So, the ethoxy is at position 1, then going around the ring, position 2 is tert-butyl, position 3 is nitro.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think in terms of the order of substitution. Let me plan the steps.

The starting material is benzene. The first step is probably to introduce one substituent, then another, then another. Each step affects where the next substituent goes.

So, to make 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene, we need to add ethoxy, tert-butyl, and nitro groups in some order.

Wait, but let me look at the options. Each option lists a series of steps. Each step is a reagent, which corresponds to a reaction.

Looking at the options, each has a series of steps (i to ix), but I don't know how many steps are needed. The target
