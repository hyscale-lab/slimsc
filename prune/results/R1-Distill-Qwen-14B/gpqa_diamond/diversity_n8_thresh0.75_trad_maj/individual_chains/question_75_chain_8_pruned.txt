Okay, so I'm trying to figure out why the GADD45G protein isn't being overexpressed in the transgenic mouse model. Let's break down the problem step by step.

The researcher introduced a sequence for a single influenza hemagglutinin antigenic determinant at the N-terminus of the GADD45G protein. They used Lipofectamine to transfect the plasmid into Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells. After selection, the protein isn't overexpressing as expected.

Looking at the provided DNA sequence, I need to check for anything that might prevent proper expression. Let's start by identifying the coding sequence and see if there are any issues.

The sequence starts with ATG, which is the start codon. So the plus strand starts with ATG TAC CCA TAC GAT G... Wait, that's the beginning. But wait, the start codon is ATG, so the next three nucleotides should be the first amino acid, methionine. Let's see: ATG is position 1-3. Then position 4-6 is TAC, which is tyrosine. Hmm, that's a bit odd because typically the start codon is followed by some initial nucleotides that code for the beginning of the protein. But maybe the HA tag is before that? Oh wait, the HA tag was introduced at the N-terminus, so perhaps the HA sequence is before the GADD45G coding sequence. But in the provided sequence, the first thing after ATG is TAC (tyrosine), which should be the first amino acid after methionine. Wait, that can't be right because HA tag would be added before the GADD45G's own sequence. So perhaps the HA tag is at the N-terminus, so the first part of the coding sequence should be the HA tag, then followed by the GADD45G sequence.

But wait, the given sequence starts with ATG, which is the start codon, followed by TAC (tyrosine). That would mean the HA tag is not present, or perhaps the HA tag isn't correctly incorporated. Alternatively, maybe the HA tag is part of the initial sequence. Wait, the question says they introduced the HA sequence into the coding sequence, so the HA would be at the N-terminus of the recombinant protein. So the coding sequence should start with the HA tag, then followed by GADD45G.

Wait, perhaps the provided sequence is the GADD45G plus the HA tag. Let me look for any stop codons or frame shifts. Let's see: the sequence ends with TGA at the very end. Let me scan through the sequence.

Looking for TAA, TAG, or TGA stop codons. Scanning the sequence:
