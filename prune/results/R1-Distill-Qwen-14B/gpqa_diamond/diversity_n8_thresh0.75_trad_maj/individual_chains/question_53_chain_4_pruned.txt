Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again carefully.

The question says that a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring compound was prepared. The FTIR shows peaks for an ester group. So, the molecule has an ester functional group. Then, looking at the 1H NMR spectrum, there are six signals. These are broken down as two aromatic H signals, two vinyl H signals (one doublet and one doublet of quartets), and two -CH3 groups. No signals for -CH2 groups. The options are four different chemical formulas, and I need to pick the correct one.

Hmm, okay. Let's start breaking this down. First, the compound is di-substituted, so there are two substituents on the benzene ring. The presence of an ester group in the IR suggests that one of the substituents is an ester group. Esters have the structure R-O-C-O-R', so they have an oxygen and a carbonyl group.

Now, looking at the NMR: there are six signals, which suggests that the molecule has six distinct sets of protons. Let me think about the possible structure. Since it's a di-substituted benzene, the substituents could be in para, ortho, or meta positions. But the NMR signals might give some clues about that.

The NMR signals:

1. Two aromatic H signals. So the benzene ring has two different types of protons. In an aromatic ring with two substituents, the number of signals depends on the substituents' positions. For example, if the substituents are para, the ring would have two sets of equivalent H's. But wait, if the substituents are in the para position, the ring would have two types of H: those adjacent to substituents and those opposite. Wait, no, actually, in para substitution, the ring would have two equivalent sets of H, like two doublets. For example, if the substituents are both strong deactivating groups, the H's next to them might be deshielded differently. But since there are two signals, maybe the substituents are in such a way that the ring has two types of H. Could the substituents be different? Oh wait, the compound has an ester group and another substituent. So, the ring is di-substituted, one substituent is an ester, and the other is something else.

Wait, but wait. The ester is O-CO-O-R. So, when attached to a benzene ring, the ester group would be something like Ar-O-CO-R, where R is an alkyl group. Or wait, ester is R-O-CO-R', so in the benzene ring, it's a substituent like Ar-O-CO-R. So the ring has an ester group attached via an oxygen.

So, the benzene ring has two substituents: one is an ester group, and the other is another group. Let's say the substituents are in the para position. Then, the ring would have two sets of equivalent protons. For example, the two protons adjacent to the substituent would be equivalent if substituents are para? Or wait, no. Let me think. If substituents are para, the ring would have two sets of equivalent H's. For example, each substituent is at opposite positions. So, for each substituent, the adjacent H's are equivalent. But if the substituents are different, like one is an ester and the other is a methyl group or something, then the two substituents being para would lead to two different sets of H's. Because the H's adjacent to the ester would be different than those adjacent to the methyl.

Wait, but in that case, the ring would have two types of H's: those next to the ester (which is a strong deactivating group) and those next to the other substituent. So, two signals for aromatic H's makes sense.

Now, the other signals: two vinyl H signals. Vinyl H's are from a double bond. So somewhere in the molecule, there's a double bond. The NMR shows two sets of vinyl H's: one is a doublet and the
