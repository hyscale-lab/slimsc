Okay, so I've got this question about optical isomerism in organic chemistry. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to think it through step by step.

The question lists four compounds and asks which show optical isomerism. The options are combinations of these. Optical isomerism, right, that's when compounds are non-superimposable mirror images of each other, leading to different physical properties like rotation of plane-polarized light. This usually involves chirality, which requires a chiral center. Oh wait, but there's also another possibility for molecules without chiral centersâ€”like in some cases of stereoisomerism due to other factors, but I think for this question, we're mainly looking at chiral centers.

Let me look at each compound one by one.

1. Dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate. So, biphenyl rings connected at positions 1 and 1'. Each ring has a nitro group at 6 and 6' positions, and carboxylate groups at 2 and 2'. Wait, are the substituents on each ring in positions that could cause the biphenyl to have a plane of symmetry? If the substituents are in positions that make the molecule symmetric, then it can't be chiral. But wait, the molecule is a biphenyl with two nitro groups and two carboxylates. Let me visualize: the 6 and 6' nitro groups are on each ring, and the 2 and 2' are also on each. So each ring has a nitro and a carboxylate. Is the arrangement such that there's a plane of symmetry?

Alternatively, maybe the molecule has a center of inversion. If it's symmetrical, then it wouldn't have optical isomers. Wait, biphenyls can have either a trans or cis arrangement. But in this case, the substituents are at 2 and 6 positions on each ring. Wait, perhaps the substituents on each ring are in a way that causes the molecule to be chiral. Alternatively, maybe the biphenyl itself isn't symmetric
