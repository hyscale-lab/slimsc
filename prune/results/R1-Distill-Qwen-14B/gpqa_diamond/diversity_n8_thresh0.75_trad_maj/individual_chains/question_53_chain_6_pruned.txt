Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question says.

The compound is a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring. So, that's like benzene with two substituents, maybe in the para positions or something else. The FTIR shows an ester group. Ester groups have carbonyls, so that's a strong absorption around 1700 cm^-1 I think. So, that tells me the compound has an ester functional group.

Looking at the 1H NMR spectrum: six signals. Let's break them down. 

First, two signals corresponding to aromatic-H. Since it's a di-substituted benzene, the coupling between the aromatic protons depends on their positions. If it's para substitution, the aromatic protons would be two sets. Wait, wait, no. Wait, for a di-substituted benzene, if the substituents are in para positions, then the aromatic protons are typically two sets: the para protons to each substituent. But wait, if the substituents are in para positions, the ring might have symmetry, so maybe the aromatic protons are one set of two equivalent H. Hmm, but wait, the question says two signals for aromatic-H. So that suggests that the substituents are in such a way that there are two different types of aromatic protons. So maybe they're para and meta? Wait, no, wait. If substituents are in adjacent positions, like ortho, then the aromatic protons would have different environments. Or maybe one substituent is in a position that creates two different H environments.

Wait, but wait, let's think about the NMR. Two signals for aromatic-H. So perhaps the substituents are in positions that create two sets. Maybe one substituent is in para, and another is in ortho. Hmm, but I'm not too confident about that. Alternatively, maybe the substituents are in such a way that the ring has two distinct sets of aromatic protons, each with two equivalent H. So like, each substituent affects two H's, but they are in different environments.

Next part: two signals for vinyl-H. One is a doublet, the other a doublet of quartets. Vinyl protons are typically deshielded and appear around 4-7 ppm. A doublet suggests coupling with one neighboring proton. A doublet of quartets is more complex; perhaps they are coupled with two different sets of protons? Or maybe each vinyl proton is coupled with more than one proton.

Also, there are two signals for –CH3 groups. No –CH2 groups. So, the molecule has two sets of methyl groups. Each –CH3 would show as a singlet if they're equivalent, but here they have two signals, so they are in different environments. So perhaps one methyl is attached to something that's more electronegative or in a different position, making their shifts different.

The possible formulas are C11H12O2, C11H14O2, C12H12O2, C12H14O2.

Let me think about the molecular formula. The ester group would be something like R-O-CO-O-R', but wait, no. Esters are RCOOR', so that's one oxygen from the ester (O) and another from the
