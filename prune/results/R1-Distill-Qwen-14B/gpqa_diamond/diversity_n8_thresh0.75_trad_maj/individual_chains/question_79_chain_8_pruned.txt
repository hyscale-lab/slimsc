Okay, so I have this NMR problem in front of me, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of these. But I'll try to break it down step by step. The question is about identifying a compound X based on its reaction product's spectra. Let me read the question again.

Compound X is C11H12O. It's reacted with 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane in a nonpolar solvent at 403 K for a day. The product's NMR data is given. The options are A to D. I need to figure out which one is correct.

Wait, what's the reaction here? 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane is a base, right? Oh, wait, I think it's often used as a catalyst in certain reactions. Or maybe it's a solvent? Hmm, sometimes it's used as a base in eliminations or maybe in some kind of rearrangement. Wait, 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane is actually a non-nucleophilic base, I think. It's used in deprotonation steps, maybe in elimination reactions. Oh, right, it's used in the Cope elimination or in some other eliminations where a strong, non-nucleophilic base is needed.

So, if Compound X is reacting under these conditions, perhaps it's undergoing an elimination reaction. Wait, the product's NMR is given. So maybe Compound X is an epoxide and upon treatment with a base, it's opening. Or wait, maybe it's something else. Let me think.

Looking at the product's 1H NMR:

Î´ 2.28 (3H, s), 2.31 (3H, s), 6.75 (1H, d), 7.08 (2H, d), 7.68 (1H, d), 7.71 (2H, d).

So there are two singlets each integrating to 3H. One at 2.28 and another at 2.31. These are probably methyl groups attached to something that doesn't split their signals. Maybe they're attached to carbonyls or to a ring that's not causing splitting. Wait, but in the 13C NMR, those would be the two carbons at 21.3 (1C) and 28.4 (1C). So each is a singlet. That suggests that each is a methyl group. Two methyl groups in the structure.

Then looking at the aromatic region: 6.75 (d), 7.08 (d, 2H), 7.68 (d), 7.71 (d, 2H). So that's a total of 1+2+1+2=6 protons. Hmm, that's a symmetrical arrangement, perhaps a para-substituted benzene or something with adjacent substituents.

Wait, maybe it's a 1,2,4,5-tetrasubstituted benzene? Or perhaps two doublets, one integrating 1H and another 2H. Let me draw it out in my mind. Maybe two doublets are from adjacent substituents.

The 13C NMR shows
