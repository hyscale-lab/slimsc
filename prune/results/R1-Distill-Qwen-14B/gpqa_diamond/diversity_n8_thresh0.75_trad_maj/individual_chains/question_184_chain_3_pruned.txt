Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. The question is about determining the correct sequence of reactions to synthesize 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene starting from benzene. There are four options, A through D, each with a different sequence of reactions.

First, I need to understand the target molecule. Let me draw it mentally. The benzene ring has three substituents: a tert-butyl group, an ethoxy group, and a nitro group. The numbering is important here. The substituents are on positions 1, 2, and 3. So, the ethoxy is on position 1, tert-butyl on position 2, and nitro on position 3. Alternatively, I should check the IUPAC numbering. Wait, the name is 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene. So yes, position 1 is ethoxy, 2 is tert-butyl, and 3 is nitro.

So the substituents are ethoxy (OCH2CH3), tert-butyl (C(CH3)3), and nitro (NO2) groups. Now, I have to figure out the order in which these groups are introduced to benzene to get the correct product with high yield.

I remember that benzene undergoes electrophilic substitution reactions, and the directing effects of substituents influence where the next group attaches. Electrophilic substitution can be directed by activating or deactivating groups. Activating groups (like -OCH3, -NH2) are ortho/para directors, while deactivating groups (like NO2, -COOH) are meta directors.

But wait, nitro groups are strong deactivating and meta-directing. But in this target molecule, nitro is at position 3, which is meta to ethoxy (position 1) and adjacent to tert-butyl (position 2). Hmmm, maybe the nitro group was introduced after another substituent that directs the nitration to a specific position.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the order in which the substituents are added. Let's consider the options.

Let me think about the substituents. The ethoxy group is an activating, ortho/para director. The tert-butyl group is bulky, but it's an activating group (since it's an alkyl group) and also ortho/para-directing. The nitro group is deactivating and meta-directing.

Since the target has all three substituents, I need to plan the order of substitution. Also, the order of adding these groups can influence the positions.

Let me consider the possible steps.

Optionally, one approach is to add the groups in a certain order to get each substituent in the correct position relative to the others.

Alternatively, sometimes you have to perform nitration in a certain position relative to existing substituents.

Wait, but maybe some of these reactions are elimination or other steps, like sulfonation or demethylation.

Wait, looking at the options, I see that some steps involve HNO3 (nitration), others involve AlCl3 (like Friedel-Crafts), EtBr with NaOH (probably an SN2 substitution), and so on.

But let's think about the synthesis pathway.

The target molecule has three substituents
