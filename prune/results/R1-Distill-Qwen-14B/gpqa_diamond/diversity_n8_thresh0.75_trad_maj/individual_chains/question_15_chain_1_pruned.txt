Okay, so I've got this question about detecting transiting planets. Hmm, I remember that the transit method is when a planet passes in front of its star from our point of view, causing a dip in brightness. The probability of this happening depends on the size of the planet relative to the star and the alignment of the orbit.

The question says there are two Earth-like planets, Planet_1 and Planet_2. Both have been detected via the RV method, so we know their minimum masses and orbital periods. Their masses are the same, but Planet_1 has a shorter orbital period—three times shorter than Planet_2's. Wait, so Planet_1 is closer to its star because a shorter period means it's orbiting faster and closer.

The host stars are interesting. Planet_1's star is twice as massive as Planet_2's, but both stars have the same radius. Oh wait, because Planet_2's host is slightly evolved, maybe it's a subgiant or something, but same size as Planet_1's star.

The probability of a transit depends on the ratio of the planet's orbital distance to the star's radius. Oh wait, more precisely, the probability is proportional to (R_planet / R_star) squared, divided by some function involving the orbital distance. Wait, maybe the formula is P = (R_p / R_s)^2 * (something about the orbital distance and star size).

Wait, I'm a bit fuzzy on that. Let me think. The transit probability is the area of the planet's disk over the area of the star's disk. So it's (R_p / R_s)^2. But wait, no—that's just
