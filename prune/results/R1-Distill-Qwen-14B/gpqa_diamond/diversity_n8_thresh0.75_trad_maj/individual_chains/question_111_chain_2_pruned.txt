Okay, so I've got two reactions to figure out here, and I need to choose the major products based on steric hindrance and product stability. Hmm, let's take them one at a time.

First reaction: 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one reacting with ethyl acrylate in the presence of t-BuOK. I remember that t-BuOK is a strong, bulky base, so this might be an enolate formation reaction. Enolates can undergo alkylation or other additions.

The starting ketone is 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one. Wait, cyclohexanone derivatives usually have enolates that form at the alpha positions. The positions adjacent to the ketone group are alpha carbons.

Looking at the structure, the ketone is at position 1. So the adjacent carbons (alpha) are positions 2 and 6. But wait, the substituents are 2-ethyl, 2,6-dimethyl. So at position 2, it's an ethyl group and a methyl (since 2,6-dimethyl would have methyl groups at 2 and 6). Wait, no, wait. The compound is 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one. So position 2 has both the ethyl and a methyl group attached. So position 2 is substituted with ethyl and methyl, making it a very substituted carbon. Position 6 has a methyl group.

So when the base (t-BuOK) deprotonates, it will choose the more substituted alpha position because the enolate is more stabilized there. The more substituted double bonds are more stable. So which alpha position is more substituted?

The alpha carbons are at C2 and C6. C2 is already substituted with ethyl and methyl. So the enolate at C2 would be more substituted than C6, which only has a methyl and maybe the cyclohexane ring.

Wait, but wait. The ketone is at position 1. The adjacent positions are 2 and 6. When the base abstracts a proton alpha to the ketone, the enolate will form either at position 2 or 6. But position 2 is more substituted. So the major enolate would form at position 2.

But wait, when the enolate forms, it's usually conjugate base, so the more substituted position is the major site. So the major enolate would be the one where the base abstracts a proton from the more substituted alpha carbon.

Then, when ethyl acrylate is added, which is an
