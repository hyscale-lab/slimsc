Alright, so I've got this multiple-choice question about stars and their photospheres. Let's see what it says.

The question says that iron atoms in star_1's photosphere are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to star_2. Hmm, I remember that the excitation of atoms in a star's atmosphere relates to the temperature. Oh right, in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE), the excitation depends on the thermal energy of the gas.

The energy difference between the energy levels is given as 1.38 x 10^-23 J. Wait, that number looks familiar. Isn't 1.38 something related to Boltzmann's constant? Oh yeah, Boltzmann's constant k is approximately 1.38 x 10^-23 J/K. So the energy difference ΔE is equal to k times the temperature, but wait, no, actually the energy difference is given by ΔE = k * T * something? Or wait, the Boltzmann distribution comes into play here.

The Boltzmann distribution describes the population of particles in different energy states. The formula is n_i / n_j = exp( - (E_i - E_j)/(k T) ), where n_i and n_j are the populations in energy levels i and j. In this case, the problem says that in star_1, the iron atoms are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to star_2. Let me clarify: which level are we talking about? Oh, probably the higher energy level. Because when atoms are more excited, they're in higher energy states.

So, let's say level 1 is the higher energy level and level 2 is a lower one. The ratio of the populations (n1/n2) is given as twice as much in star_1 compared to star_2. So for star_1, n1/n2 = 2 * (n1/n2 of star_2).

Wait, no. The question says that in star_1, the iron atoms are twice as excited, so maybe n1 for star_1 is twice as much as n1 for star_2, or perhaps the ratio n1/n2 is twice as large in star_1 compared to star_2. Let me read again: "iron atoms in the photosphere of star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level when compared to the iron atoms in star_2." So, perhaps the population in the excited state is higher for star_1. Let's model it.

Assume for star_1, the ratio n1
