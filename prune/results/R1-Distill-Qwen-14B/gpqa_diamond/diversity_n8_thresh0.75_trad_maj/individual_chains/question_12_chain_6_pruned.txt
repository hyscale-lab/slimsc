Okay, so I have this physics problem to solve, and I'm a bit new to this, so I'll need to think it through carefully. Let me read the question again to make sure I understand what's being asked.

The problem is about finding the kinetic energy of the product particles in a decay process. The reaction given is Pi(+) → mu(+) + nu. Here, Pi(+) is at rest. The rest masses are given: Pi(+) is 139.6 MeV, and mu(+) is 105.7 MeV. The options are A, B, C, D with different pairs of kinetic energies.

Hmm, I remember that in particle physics, when a particle at rest decays into two or more particles, energy and momentum must be conserved. Since the pion is at rest, the total momentum after decay should be zero. Which implies that the momenta of the muon and the neutrino must be equal in magnitude and opposite in direction.

Wait, but neutrinos are tricky. I think the neutrino is a lepton, and in this case, it's a neutrino, which has a very small (but non-zero) mass. But in many problems, especially when the masses are much smaller than the other particles, the neutrino is considered massless. I'm not sure if that's the case here, but I'll proceed with that assumption unless told otherwise.

So, the pion is at rest, so its initial momentum is zero. The decay products must have equal and opposite momenta. So, the magnitudes of their momenta are the same, but directions opposite.

Since the pion is at rest, its total energy is just its rest mass energy, which is m_pi c². But since we're working in MeV units, I can ignore c² because E=mc², and m is in MeV/c². So the energy is 139.6 MeV.

Now, the total energy after decay is the sum of the energies of the muon and the neutrino. Each of their energies is the sum of their rest mass energy and their kinetic energy. But wait, the neutrino's rest mass is negligible, so its energy is just its kinetic energy. The muon's energy is its rest mass plus its kinetic energy.

So, let me denote the kinetic energy of the muon as KE_mu and the neutrino as KE_nu. But wait, the neutrino's rest mass is zero (if we consider it massless), so its energy is all kinetic. So E_nu = KE_nu.

Wait, but the muon's rest mass is 105.7 MeV, so E_mu = 105.7 MeV + KE_mu.

So the total energy after decay is E_mu + E_nu = (105.7 + KE_mu) + KE_nu.

But this must equal the pion's rest energy, which is 139.6 MeV. So:

105.7 + KE_mu + KE_nu = 139.6 → KE_mu + KE_nu = 139.6 - 105.7 = 33.9 MeV.

Okay, that's one equation.

Now, the other condition is conservation of momentum. The pion has zero initial momentum, so the vectors of the two decay products must cancel each other out. So, the magnitudes of their momenta are equal. Let me denote the magnitude of the muon's momentum as p, and the neutrino's as p as well, but in opposite directions.

So, for the muon, since it's moving, its momentum p is related to its mass and energy. The energy of the muon is E_mu = sqrt( (p c)^2 + (m_mu c²)^2 ) / c²? Wait, maybe I'm mixing units here. Let me think in terms of natural units where c=1, so energy and momentum are in units where E (MeV) and p (MeV/c) with E² = p² c² + m² c^4. But in terms of MeV and MeV/c, the equation would be E^2 = (p c)^2 + (m c^2)^2. But when c=1, E^2 = p^2 + m^2.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit confused. Let me try to set up the equations properly.

In natural units (c=1), the energy of the muon is E_mu = sqrt( p^2 + m_mu^2 ), where p is the magnitude of its momentum.

The neutrino's energy is E_nu = p, because for massless particles, E = |p|.

So, from conservation of energy:
E_mu + E_nu = m_pi
Which is sqrt(p^2 + m_mu^2) + p = m_pi.

We can solve this equation for p.

Let me plug in the numbers. m_pi is 139.6 MeV, m_mu is 105.7 MeV.

So, sqrt(p^2 + (105.7)^2) + p = 139.6.

Let me subtract p from both sides:

sqrt(p^2 + (105.7)^2) = 139.6 - p.

Now, square both sides:

p^2 + (105.7)^2 = (139.6 - p)^2.

Expanding the right side:

(139.6)^2 - 2*139.6*p + p^2.

So the equation becomes:

p^2 + (105.7)^2 = (139.6)^2 - 2*139.6 p + p^2.

The p^2 terms cancel out. So:

(105.7)^2 = (139.6)^2 - 2*139.6 p.

Let me compute the squares.

(105.7)^2 ≈ 105.7 * 105.7. Let me compute that. 100^2 is 10,000, 5.7^2 is about 32.49, and cross term 2 * 100 *5.7=1140. So (100+5.7)^2 = 10000 + 1140 +32.49= 11172.49.

Similarly, 139.6^2 is... Let's compute 140^2 is 19600. Subtract 0.4*(2*140) + (0.4)^2. Hmm, wait, 139.6 = 140 - 0.4.

(140 - 0.4)^2 = 140^2 - 2*140*0.4 + 0.4^2 = 19600 - 112 + 0.16 = 19600-112 is 19488; plus 0.16 is 19488.16.

So now, equation becomes:

11172.49 = 19488.16 - 2*139.6 * p.

Let me compute 2*139.6 = 279.2.

So,

11172.49 = 19488.16 - 279.2 p.

Rearranging:

279.2
