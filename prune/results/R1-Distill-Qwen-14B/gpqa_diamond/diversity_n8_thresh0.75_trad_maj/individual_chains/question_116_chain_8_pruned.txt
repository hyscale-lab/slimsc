Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me start by reading the question carefully.

The question is about a series of reactions starting from compound A, going through B and C, and then reacting with another compound to form D. I need to identify what D is from the given options.

First, looking at compound A's NMR data. It shows two signals: a triplet at 0.9 ppm integrating for 6H and a quartet at 1.3 ppm integrating for 4H. Hmm, I remember that in NMR, the splitting tells us about neighboring protons. A triplet usually means each proton is split into two by two neighboring protons. Like maybe a CH2CH3 group. Wait, but the integration is 6H for the triplet. That makes me think of two equivalent CH3 groups. So maybe something like (CH3)2CH- or perhaps a cyclopropane ring, but that's less common. Wait, 6H as a triplet could be two CH3 groups next to a CH2, but wait, no, because if it's a triplet, each of the 6H is split by two neighboring Hs. Oh wait, maybe it's a di-substituted ethyl group. Let me think.

Wait, the triplet at 0.9 ppm is typically for methyl groups next to a CH2. For example, an ethyl group (CH2CH3): the CH3 would be a triplet because it's adjacent to the CH2 (which has 2 Hs). So if the triplet is 6H, that suggests two CH3 groups, each giving 3H. So maybe it's a structure like CH2CH(CH3)2. Oh, wait, no, because that would be a different split. Alternatively, perhaps it's a cyclopropane with two methyl substituents. Oh
