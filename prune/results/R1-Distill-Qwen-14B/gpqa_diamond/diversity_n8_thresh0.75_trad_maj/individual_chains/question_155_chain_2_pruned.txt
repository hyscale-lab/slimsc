Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question again and see what it's asking.

Alright, the problem is about finding the uncertainty ΔP_z of the operator P_z for a given quantum state. The state is an eigenstate of P_x with a specific eigenvalue, and the state vector is provided. 

First, I remember that the uncertainty in an observable is calculated using the formula ΔP = sqrt(⟨P²⟩ - ⟨P⟩²). So I need to compute ⟨P_z²⟩ and ⟨P_z⟩ for the given state.

Wait, but wait a minute. The state is an eigenstate of P_x, not of P_z. So when I compute the expectation value of P_z in this state, it might not be zero, but I'm not sure. Hmm.

Let me outline the steps I think I need to take:

1. **Write down the given matrices and state vector:**
   The operator P_z has a matrix form given as:
   [[ℏ, 0, 0],
    [0, 0, 0],
    [0, 0, -ℏ]]
   So it's diagonal, which makes sense because the basis vectors are the eigenvectors of P_z. The state vector is given as a column vector with elements (-1/2, 1/sqrt(2), -1/2). Let's denote this state as |ψ⟩.

2. **Compute ⟨P_z⟩:**
   To find the expectation value of P_z, I need to compute ⟨ψ| P_z |ψ⟩. Because P_z is diagonal, this can be done by taking the components of |ψ⟩, multiplying each by the corresponding diagonal element of P_z, and summing them up.

   So, the components of |ψ⟩ are:
   ψ₁ = -1/2,
   ψ₂ = 1/sqrt(2),
   ψ₃ = -1/2.

   The diagonal elements of P_z are ℏ, 0, -ℏ.

   So ⟨P_z⟩ = ψ₁* * (ℏ) * ψ₁ + ψ₂* * (0) * ψ₂ + ψ₃* * (-ℏ) * ψ₃.

   Let's compute each term:

   First term: (-1/2)^2 * ℏ = (1/4)ℏ.
   Second term: (1/sqrt(2))^2 * 0 = 0.
   Third term: (-1/2)^2 * (-ℏ) = (1/4)(-ℏ) = -ℏ/4.

   Adding them together: (1/4)ℏ + 0 - (1/4)ℏ = 0. So ⟨P_z⟩ is zero.

3. **Compute ⟨P_z²⟩:**
   Since P_z squared would just be each diagonal element squared. So the matrix P_z² is:
   [[ℏ², 0, 0],
    [0, 0, 0],
    [0, 0, (ℏ)^2]]

   Wait, no. Wait, the diagonal elements of P_z are ℏ, 0, -ℏ. So when squared, they become ℏ², 0, ℏ².

   So the matrix P_z² is:
   [[ℏ², 0, 0],
    [0, 0, 0],
    [0, 0, ℏ²]]

   So ⟨P_z²⟩ is the same as ⟨ψ| P_z² |ψ⟩.

   Again, since P_z² is diagonal, the expectation value is the sum of each |ψ_i|² multiplied by the corresponding diagonal element.

   So, compute each term:

   ψ₁² * ℏ² → (1/4) * ℏ²
   ψ₂² * 0 → 0
   ψ₃² * ℏ² → (1/4) * ℏ²

   Summing these gives (1/4 + 1/4) * ℏ² = (1/2)ℏ².

   So ⟨P_z²⟩ = (1/2)ℏ².

4. **Calculate the uncertainty:**
   Now ΔP_z = sqrt(⟨P_z²⟩ - (⟨P_z⟩)^2 ). Since ⟨P_z⟩ is zero, this becomes sqrt( (1/2)ℏ² ) = (ℏ / sqrt(2)).

   So the uncertainty is ℏ divided by the square root of 2.

5. **Looking at the options:**
   Option B is ℏ / sqrt(2), which matches my calculation.

Wait, but let me double-check the state vector and the calculations. Did I make any mistake in the matrix multiplications?

No, the state is given as ( -1/2, 1/√2, -1/2 ) as a column vector. So when calculating the expectation value, it
