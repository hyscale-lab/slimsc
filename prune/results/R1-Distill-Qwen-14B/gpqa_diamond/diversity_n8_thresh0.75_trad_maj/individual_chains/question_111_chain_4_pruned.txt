Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem to solve, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of these reactions. Let's break it down step by step. The question has two parts, A and B, and I need to figure out the major products for each. Then I'll match them to the options given.

Starting with reaction A: 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one reacting with ethyl acrylate in the presence of t-BuOK. Hmm, I remember that when a ketone reacts with an enolate, it's usually a Claisen or aldol addition. But wait, ethyl acrylate is an acylating agent, so maybe it's an example of the acetylation via enolate formation.

Wait, cyclohexanone derivatives can undergo enolate formation when treated with a strong base like t-BuOK. The enolate would attack the electrophilic part of ethyl acrylate. But where does the enolate form here?

Looking at the structure of 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one. The ketone is at position 1, I think. Let me draw the structure mentally. The cyclohexane ring has a ketone at C1. Then, there's an ethyl group at C2 and methyl groups at C2 and C6. So the substituents are on C1 (the ketone), C2 (ethyl and methyl), and C6 (methyl).

Wait, wait, the IUPAC name is 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one. So, the cyclohexanone has substituents at C2 (ethyl and methyl) and C6 (methyl). So, the structure is: the ketone is at C1. Then, C2 has an ethyl group and a methyl group. C6 has a methyl group. The other positions (like C3, C4, C5) are CH2 groups, I think.

When a ketone is treated with a strong base like t-BuOK, the alpha carbons (the ones adjacent to the carbonyl) are deprotonated to form enolates. In this case, the alpha carbons are C2 and C6, since the ketone is at C1. Wait, no. Wait, cyclohexanone is a six-membered ring with the ketone at C1. So the carbonyl is C1, so the adjacent carbons are C2 and C6. So the alpha positions are C2 and C6.

So
