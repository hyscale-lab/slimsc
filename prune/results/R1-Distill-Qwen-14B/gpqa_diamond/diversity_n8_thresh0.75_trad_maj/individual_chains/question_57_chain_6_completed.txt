Okay, so I've got this physics problem in front of me about elastic scattering of electrons. Hmm, let me think. The question is about finding the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude along the incident beam direction. I remember that in scattering experiments, the scattering amplitude is a complex quantity, right? So it has a real part and an imaginary part.

Wait, the problem gives me phase shifts: δ₀ is 90 degrees, δ₁ is 67, δ₂ is 55, δ₃ is 30, and δ₄ is 13 degrees. Oh, and they say to ignore the rest of the phase shifts beyond δ₄. So I don't have to worry about higher-order terms, I guess.

I think the formula for the scattering amplitude f(θ) involves the sum of these phase shifts. Or wait, maybe it's the sum of the sine of each phase shift multiplied by some terms. Oh right, the formula I remember is f(θ) = (1/k) * Σ [ (2l+1) * sin(δ_l) * P_l(cosθ) ] where k is the wave number, l is the orbital angular momentum quantum number, and P_l are the Legendre polynomials.

Wait, but the question is specifically asking about the imaginary part along the incident beam direction. That would be θ = 0 degrees because the beam is along the direction of incidence. So cosθ is 1, right? So the direction is along the beam, which is θ = 0.

But wait, the formula for the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude—oh, right, the imaginary part of f is given by (1/k) * Σ (2l+1) * sin(δ_l) * P_l(1). Because when θ=0, cosθ=1, so each P_l(1) is 1 if l=0, otherwise... Hmm, no, wait. The Legendre polynomials P_l(1) is 1 for all l, because P_l(1) = 1. Because P_l(x) evaluated at x=1 is always 1, regardless of l. Because the generating function at x=1 gives the sum of 1 for each l.

Wait, so for θ=0, the direction along the beam, the expression simplifies a lot. So the imaginary part of f is (1/k) multiplied by the sum over l of (2l+1) multiplied by sin(δ_l) multiplied by 1.

So the formula for the imaginary part Im(f) is (1/k) * [ (2*0+1) sinδ₀ + (2*1+1) sinδ₁ + (2*2+1) sinδ₂ + ... ].

Wait, but wait a second. The phase shift for each l is given, so l starts at 0. So we have terms for l=0,1,2,3,4. Each term is (2l+1) sin(δ_l), summed, then multiplied by 1/k.

But wait, what's k? The wave number k is given by (2π)/λ, where λ is the wavelength. But the electrons are 50 MeV. I think I should calculate the de Broglie wavelength. Since the electrons are non-relativistic? Wait, 50 MeV is a lot, but electrons have rest mass about 0.511 MeV. So 50 MeV is relativistic. So I might need to use relativistic formulas.

The kinetic energy is 50 MeV. The total energy E is then 50 MeV plus rest mass energy. Wait, the rest mass is 0.511 MeV, so E=50.511 MeV. But wait, for high energies, maybe we can approximate E ≈ 50 MeV for the purpose of calculating the wavelength, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the momentum is given by sqrt(2mE) for non-relativistic, but when E is much larger than m, the relativistic formula is better.

Wait, the momentum p for an electron with kinetic energy K is given by (using relativistic formula):

K = (γ - 1) m c²,

where γ is the Lorentz factor. So E = γ m c².

But perhaps a better approach is to calculate the momentum p from the kinetic energy. Alternatively, for high-energy electrons, the relation between energy and momentum is E ≈ pc, because when E >> m c², E ≈ pc. So for E=50 MeV, which is much larger than m c² (0.511 MeV), we can approximate E ≈ pc. So p ≈ E / c.

So p = 50 MeV / c. But to find k, which is p/ħ. So k = p / ħ = (50 MeV/c) / (ħ c) ) * c. Wait, let me get the units right.

Wait, ħ is in units of MeV·s/c, I think. Wait, Planck constant ħ is approximately 197.33 MeV·fm (since 1 fm is 10^-15 m). So ħ c is approximately 197.33 MeV·fm * (speed of light in fm/s) but I think when using natural units, ħ c is about 197.33 MeV·fm.

Wait, because 1 fm is 1e-15 meters, and c is about 3e8 m/s, so ħ c ≈ (197.33 MeV s) * (3e8 m/s) = 197.33 * 3e8 * 1e-15 m * MeV = 197.33e-7 MeV·m. Wait, no, perhaps better to remember that ħ c is approximately 197.33 MeV·fm. So that ħ c = 197.33 MeV·fm.

So for p in units of MeV/c, and since ħ c = 197.33 MeV·fm, then p (in MeV/c) multiplied by ħ c (MeV·fm) gives p * ħ c = (MeV/c) * (MeV·fm) ) = (MeV² fm)/c. Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating.

Alternatively, k = p/(ħ), and p = E/c (approximate for E >> m c²).

So E is 50 MeV, so p = 50 MeV / c.

Then, k = p / ħ = (50 MeV/(c)) / (197.33 MeV·fm) ) * (1/ħ c?), wait, I'm getting confused. Alternatively, let's compute k in units of 1/fm.

Since ħ c ≈ 197.33 MeV fm, so 1/(ħ c) ≈ 1/(197.33 MeV fm) = (1/197.33) MeV^-1 fm^-1.

Wait, but perhaps I should calculate k as p / ħ. So p is 50 MeV/c.

So k = (50 MeV/c) / (197.33 MeV·fm) ) * (1/ħ) ?

Wait, I'm getting stuck. Maybe I should look for a formula to compute k directly from the energy.

Alternatively, the wave number k is given by sqrt(2mE)/ħ, but that's the non-relativistic formula. But for E much larger than m c², that's not accurate. So perhaps the relativistic approach is better.

Wait, another approach: the de Broglie wavelength λ is h/(p), where h is Planck's constant. Since h = 2π ħ.

So, p = h/(λ) = (2π ħ)/λ. But perhaps I can express λ in terms of energy.

Alternatively, for an electron with kinetic energy K, the momentum p is given by sqrt(2 m K) in non-relativistic case, but for relativistic case, p = sqrt( (gamma m c)^2 - (m c)^2 ) / c.

Wait, gamma is E/(m c²). So E = K + m c² = 50 + 0.511 MeV ≈ 50.511 MeV.

So gamma = E/(m c²) = (50.511 MeV) / (0.511 MeV) ≈ 98.85.

Then, p = gamma m v / c, but v is approximately c for high gamma. So p ≈ gamma m c.

Wait, but gamma = E/(m c²), so E = gamma m c². Then, p = (gamma m c²) * (c) ) / c² = gamma m c. So p = gamma m c.

So p ≈ (50.511 / 0.511) MeV/c * m c²/c. Wait, no, that seems a bit off. Let me think again.

Alternatively, the momentum p = gamma m v. But for high energies, v ≈ c, so p ≈ gamma m c.

Gamma is about 50.511 / 0.511 ≈ 98.85, so m c is 0.511 MeV·s/(c), perhaps. Wait, no, m c² is 0.511 MeV, so m c is 0.511 MeV / c.

So p ≈ gamma * (m c) ) = 98.85 * (0.511 MeV / c) ) = 98.85 * 0.511 MeV / c ≈ around 50.5 MeV/c.

Wait, that makes sense because the kinetic energy is 50 MeV, so the momentum is about 50 MeV/c.

So p ≈ 50 MeV/c. Thus, the wave number k is p/(ħ). So k = (50 MeV/c) / (ħ) ).

But ħ is 197.33 MeV·fm. So ħ c is 197.33 MeV·fm * c (but I'm getting mixed up with units here).

Wait, perhaps it's easier to compute k in terms of 1/fm.

So ħ c = 197.33 MeV·fm, so c = (ħ c)/ (ħ) = 197.33 MeV·fm / ħ.

Wait, no, perhaps I should compute k as p/(ħ c) * c. Because ħ is in units of MeV·fm.

Wait, maybe an alternative approach. Let's compute k = p/(ħ), where p is in units of MeV/c.

So, p = 50 MeV/c.

ħ is 197.33 MeV·fm. So 1/(ħ) = 1/(197.33 MeV·fm).

So, k = (50 MeV/c) / (197.33 MeV·fm) ) * (1/c) ?

Wait, that doesn't seem right. Alternatively, perhaps I should express k in terms of (MeV/c) divided by (ħ c), but I'm getting stuck.

Alternatively, perhaps I should just calculate k in terms of 1/fm.

Since ħ c = 197.33 MeV·fm, then 1/(ħ c) = 1/(197.33 MeV·fm) = (1/197.33) MeV^-1 fm^-1.

So, k = (p) / ħ = (50 MeV/c) / (197.33 MeV·fm) ) * (1/ħ) ?

Wait, maybe I should find the k as:

k = p/(ħ c) ) * c.

Hmm, perhaps another approach. Let me think about units.

The wave number k has units of 1/length. p has units of MeV/c. ħ has units of MeV·fm. So when I divide p by ħ, (MeV/c)/(MeV·fm) ) = (1/(c fm))).

But c is in units of fm/s. So (1/(c fm)) = s/(fm^2). Hmm, that's not correct for k, which should be 1/fm. So perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, I think I'm making a mistake here. Let's try another approach. I remember that for an electron, the wavelength λ is given by λ = h/(p), where h is Planck's constant (about 6.626e-34 J·s), and p is the momentum in kg·m/s.

But when dealing with high energies, perhaps using natural units (c=1, ħ=1) would make this easier. But I'm not very confident about that.

Alternatively, perhaps I can find the formula for k in terms of the energy E.

In natural units where ħ = c = 1, the wave number k is sqrt(2mE), but that's the non-relativistic formula. Since E is much larger than m, maybe we can use the relativistic relation.

Wait, in natural units, E^2 = p^2 c^4 + m^2 c^4.

So, E ≈ pc for large p (since E=pc when m is negligible).

So, p ≈ E/c. Then, k = p/(ħ) = (E/c) / ħ.

In natural units, E is in MeV, c is in fm per 1e-15 seconds or something, but perhaps it's easier to write E in MeV, and use ħ c ≈ 197.33 MeV·fm.

So, E is 50 MeV, so p = E/c = 50 MeV / c.

Then, k = p/(ħ) = (50 MeV/c) / (197.33 MeV·fm) ) * (1/ħ) ?

Wait, no, I think I'm making this more complicated than it needs to be. Let me try to compute k:

k = p/(ħ) = (50 MeV/c) / (197.33 MeV·fm) ) * (1/ħ)? No, that can't be right because the units don't match. Wait, perhaps it's better to compute k = (p) / (ħ c) * c.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that in natural units, ħ c is 197.33 MeV·fm, so 1/(ħ c) = 1/(197.33 MeV·fm).

But I'm not getting anywhere. Let me try to find k numerically.

E = 50 MeV. Using the relativistic formula, p = sqrt( (gamma m c)^2 - (m c)^2 ) / c.

Wait, E = gamma m c², so gamma = E/(m c²) = 50.511 MeV / 0.511 MeV ≈ 98.85.

Then, p = gamma m v, and for high gamma, v ≈ c. So p ≈ gamma m c.

m c is 0.511 MeV / c. So p ≈ 98.85 * 0.511 MeV/c = approx 50.5 MeV/c.

So p ≈ 50 MeV/c.

Now, ħ is 197.33 MeV·fm.

So, k = p / ħ = (50 MeV/c) / (197.33 MeV·fm) ) * (1/c? No, wait, ħ is in MeV·fm, so when I divide p (MeV/c) by ħ (MeV·fm), I get (MeV/c) / (MeV·fm) ) = 1/(c·fm). But c is in units of fm/s, so 1/(c·fm) is s/(fm²), which doesn't make sense for k, which should be 1/fm.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula is k = (p c) / ħ.

Wait, p is in MeV/c. So p c would be (MeV/c) * c = MeV.

So k = p c / ħ = (50 MeV/c * c) / 197.33 MeV·fm ) = 50 MeV / (197.33 MeV·fm) ) = 50 / 197.33 (1/fm) ≈ 0.253 fm^-1.

So k ≈ 0.253 fm^-1.

Wait, that seems more reasonable.

So now I have k ≈ 0.253 fm^-1.

Now, the formula for the imaginary part of f is (1/k) multiplied by the sum from l=0 to 4 of (2l+1) sin δ_l.

So let's compute each term:

l=0: (2*0 +1) =1, sin(90 degrees)=1.

l=1: 3, sin(67 degrees). Let me compute sin(67). 67 degrees is approximately 0.9205.

l=2:5, sin(55)≈0.8192.

l=3:7, sin(30)=0.5.

l=4:9, sin(13)≈0.22495.

Now, compute each (2l+1) * sin δ_l:

l=0: 1 * 1 =1.

l=1:3 * 0.9205≈2.7615.

l=2:5 * 0.8192≈4.096.

l=3:7 * 0.5 =3.5.

l=4:9 * 0.22495≈2.02455.

Now sum these:

1 + 2.7615 = 3.7615.

3.7615 +4.096 =7.8575.

7.8575 +3.5=11.3575.

11.3575 +2.02455≈13.38205.

Multiply this sum by (1/k), which is 1/0.253 ≈3.9526.

So Im(f) = 13.38205 * 3.9526 ≈ let's compute that.

13.38205 * 3.9526 ≈ ?

Let me compute 13 * 4 =52; 0.38205 *4≈1.5282. So approx 53.5.

But more accurately:

13.38205 * 3.9526 ≈ let's do 13 * 3.9526 = 51.3838.

0.38205 *3.9526 ≈ approx 1.510.

So total ≈51.3838 +1.510 ≈52.8938.

Wait, but I'm getting around 52.8938.

Wait, wait a second, perhaps I should compute more accurately.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the sum of the terms.

Wait, let me recheck the terms:

l=0:1*1=1.

l=1:3* sin(67) ≈ 3*(0.9205)=2.7615.

l=2:5 * sin(55) =5 * 0.8192=4.096.

l=3:7 * 0.5=3.5.

l=4:9 * sin(13)≈9 *0.22495=2.02455.

So sum is 1 + 2.7615 =3.7615; +4.096=7.8575; +3.5=11.3575; +2.02455=13.38205.

So sum is 13.38205.

Multiply by (1/k) =1/0.253 ≈3.952569.

13.38205 *3.952569.

Let me compute that:

13 * 3.952569 =51.3834.

0.38205 *3.952569 ≈ let's compute:

0.3 *3.952569=1.18577.

0.08 *3.952569=0.3162055.

0.00205*3.952569≈0.0080947.

Adding these: 1.18577 +0.3162055=1.5019755 +0.0080947≈1.51007.

So total is 51.3834 +1.51007≈52.8935.

So Im(f)=52.8935 fm^{-1} * (1/k) ?

Wait, wait, no. Wait, Im(f) is calculated as (1/k) multiplied by the sum. Wait, let me re-express the formula.

Wait, the formula is Im(f) = (1/k) * [ sum (2l+1) sin δ_l ].

So sum is 13.38205, 1/k is approx 3.952569.

So 13.38205 *3.952569 ≈52.8935.

Wait, but what are the units here?

Wait, k is in fm^{-1}, so 1/k is fm.

So the result is 52.8935 fm.

Looking at the options, option D is 251.271 fm, which is way off. Option C is 177.675, which is about 3.35 times higher.

Wait, did I make a mistake in calculation? Let me check the sum again.

Wait, sum is 1+2.7615+4.096+3.5+2.02455=13.38205.

Multiply by 3.952569: 13.38205 *3.952569.

Wait, perhaps I should compute this more accurately.

Let me compute 13.38205 *3.952569:

= (13 + 0.38205) * 3.952569

= 13 *3.952569 +0.38205 *3.952569.

13 *3.952569 = 51.383397.

0.38205 *3.952569:

Calculate 0.3 *3.952569=1.1857707.

0.08 *3.952569=0.31620552.

0.00205 *3.952569≈0.0080947.

Adding: 1.1857707 +0.31620552=1.5019762 +0.0080947=1.5100709.

So total: 51.383397 +1.5100709=52.893468.

So approximately 52.8935 fm.

But looking at the options, none of them match this. The closest is option C (177.675 fm), which is about 3.35 times larger. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation of k.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating k. Let me recalculate k.

Earlier, I said that E≈50 MeV, p≈50 MeV/c.

k = p/(ħ) = (50 MeV/c) / (197.33 MeV·fm) * (1/c?) No, wait, 1/(ħ) has units of 1/(MeV·fm).

Wait, p is 50 MeV/c, and ħ is 197.33 MeV·fm.

So, k = (50 MeV/c) / (197.33 MeV·fm) ) * (1/c) ?

Wait, no, units don't make sense. Alternatively, perhaps the formula is k = (p c)/(ħ).

Because p c would have units of MeV, and ħ has units of MeV·fm, so (p c)/(ħ) would be (MeV)/(MeV·fm) )=1/fm.

So that makes sense. So k = (p c) / ħ = (50 MeV/c * c) / (197.33 MeV·fm) )=50 MeV/(197.33 MeV·fm) )=50/197.33 1/fm ≈0.253 fm^-1.

Which is what I had earlier. So that's correct.

Wait, so why is my result not matching any of the options? The options are A)87163, B)355.351, C)177.675, D)251.271.

Hmm, wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the phase shift sum.

Wait, the sum is (2l+1) sin δ_l for l=0 to 4.

Wait, let's recompute each term accurately.

l=0: δ=90°, sin=1. So term is 1 *1=1.

l=1: δ=67°, sin(67)= let's get precise. 67 degrees in radians is about 1.16937 radians. Sin(67)= approximately 0.920504.

So 3 *0.920504=2.761512.

l=2: δ=55°, sin(55)=approx 0.81915.

5 * 0.81915=4.09575.

l=3: δ=30°, sin=0.5. 7 *0.5=3.5.

l=4: δ=13°, sin(13)= approx 0.224951.

9 *0.224951≈2.02456.

Now sum:

1 +2.761512=3.761512.

+4.09575=7.857262.

+3.5=11.357262.

+2.02456=13.381822.

So sum is approximately 13.381822.

Multiply by (1/k)=3.952569.

13.381822 *3.952569 ≈ let me compute this:

13 *3.952569=51.383397.

0.381822 *3.952569 ≈ let's compute 0.3 *3.952569=1.1857707.

0.08 *3.952569=0.31620552.

0.001822*3.952569≈approx 0.007213.

So sum: 1.1857707 +0.31620552=1.5019762 +0.007213=1.509189.

So total Im(f)≈51.383397 +1.509189≈52.892586 fm.

Hmm, around 52.89 fm.

But the options don't have this. So perhaps I made a mistake in the formula.

Wait, another thought: maybe the formula for Im(f) is actually (1/k) multiplied by the sum of (2l+1) sin δ_l, but I forgot that each term is multiplied by (sin δ_l), but perhaps I should have used (sin δ_l) as 2 sin (δ_l/2) cos (δ_l/2), but I don't think that's the case.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula. Wait, another thought: The imaginary part of the scattering amplitude is given by (1/k) times the sum of (2l+1) sin (δ_l) times P_l(cosθ), evaluated at θ=0, which is P_l(1)=1.

So the sum is correct.

But maybe the phase shifts have a different meaning. Oh wait, wait! Phase shifts in scattering theory are typically defined for each partial wave l. But in some conventions, the phase shift δ_l is actually taken modulo π, so that the sine could be positive or negative. But in this problem, all the given δ_l are in the range 0-90 degrees, which is fine.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of k. Let me double-check.

Wait, perhaps I should use the relativistic formula for the momentum.

E = gamma m c², p = gamma m v.

But for high gamma, v ≈ c, so p ≈ gamma m c.

Wait, gamma is E/(m c²) = 50.511 / 0.511 ≈98.85.

So p ≈98.85 * 0.511 MeV/c = 50.5 MeV/c.

So p =50.5 MeV/c.

Then, k = p c / ħ = (50.5 MeV/c * c) / (197.33 MeV·fm) )=50.5 /197.33 (1/fm).

50.5 /197.33 ≈0.2555 fm^-1.

So 1/k≈3.921 fm.

Wait, so Im(f)= sum * (1/k) =13.3818 *3.921 ≈52.44 fm.

Still doesn't match any options.

Hmm, perhaps I need to think differently. Alternatively, perhaps the formula for the imaginary part of the amplitude is (1/k) * [ sum (2l+1) sin δ_l ] multiplied by something else, like 4π or something.

Wait, another thought: I think I may have forgotten a factor of 1/(2k), because sometimes the scattering amplitude is written as f(θ) = (1/(2ik)) sum ... , but I'm not certain.

Wait, let me check the formula again.

The scattering amplitude in partial wave expansion is f(θ) = (1/k) sum_{l=0}^∞ (2l+1) e^{2iδ_l} (sin δ_l) P_l(cosθ) * (some factor?).

Wait, no, more accurately, the expression is:

f(θ) = (1/k) sum [ (2l+1) sin δ_l P_l(cosθ) ].

Wait, perhaps that's correct. So no, I think I didn't miss any factor.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that the wave number k is not correct. Maybe I should have used a different approach to calculate k.

Alternative approach: The momentum p is given by sqrt(2 m E), assuming non-relativistic. But since E=50 MeV, which is much larger than m c², the non-relativistic approach isn't valid. So perhaps I should use the relativistic expression.

The relativistic expression for the momentum is p = sqrt( (E)^2 - (m c^2)^2 ) / c.

Wait, E is 50 MeV, m c^2 is 0.511 MeV.

So E² = (50)^2 = 2500 (MeV)^2.

(m c^2)^2 = (0.511)^2 ≈0.261 (MeV)^2.

So p c = sqrt(E^2 - (m c^2)^2 ) = sqrt(2500 - 0.261) ≈sqrt(2500) =50 MeV.

So p = (50 MeV)/c.

So, same as before. So k= p/(ħ) =50 MeV/c / (197.33 MeV fm) ) =50/(197.33) 1/(fm).

Because ħ has units MeV fm.

Wait, 50/(197.33)=0.253 fm^{-1}.

Which gives 1/k=3.952 fm.

So Im(f)=13.3818 *3.952≈52.89 fm.

But the options don't have that. So perhaps I made a mistake in the formula.

Wait, another thought: Perhaps the formula for the imaginary part includes a factor of 2, because sin(δ) is related to the imaginary part of the amplitude. Alternatively, perhaps in the formula I forgot that the amplitude f is multiplied by something else.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct formula is Im(f) = (1/k) sum (2l+1) sin δ_l.

Wait, that's what I used.

Hmm, but perhaps the given phase shifts are in degrees, so I should have converted them to radians before computing the sine. Because in the calculation, I assumed that the sine function was in radians.

Wait, wait! Oh no, I think I made a crucial mistake here. I assumed that the phase shifts are in radians, but they are given in degrees. So when I compute sin(δ_l), I should convert degrees to radians.

Wait, that's a big mistake! So I need to recalculate each sin(δ_l) with δ_l in radians.

So let's correct that.

Compute each δ_l in radians.

l=0: δ=90 degrees = π/2 ≈1.5708 radians. sin(1.5708)=1.

l=1:67 degrees → 67 * π/180 ≈1.16937 radians. sin(1.16937) ≈0.920504.

l=2:55 degrees →55 * π/180≈0.95993 radians. sin(0.95993)= approximately 0.81915.

l=3:30 degrees=π/6≈0.523599 radians. sin(0.523599)=0.5.

l=4:13 degrees →13 * π/180≈0.226893 radians. sin(0.226893)=approx 0.224951.

So the terms are the same as before, because I already calculated the sines correctly. Wait, no, because I converted degrees to radians before computing the sine. So no, that's correct.

Wait, no, that's not correct. Because in the calculation earlier, I used the degrees to compute the sine. No, wait, I used the sine of the angle in degrees. Oh wait, no, I think I used the calculator in degrees mode. So when I computed sin(67) as 0.9205, that's correct if the calculator was set to degrees.

But wait, wait. In programming or in math, the sine function usually takes radians. So if I'm using a calculator in degrees mode, the calculations are correct. But if I'm using a calculator in radians mode, then I would have to convert the degrees to radians first.

But in this problem, when I computed sin(67 degrees) as approximately 0.9205, that's correct as long as I considered the angle in degrees. So perhaps I did that correctly.

Wait, but no, in reality, in programming languages, the functions take radians. So if I wrote a program, I would have to convert degrees to radians before taking the sine. But in this case, I'm just calculating manually, so I can either use a calculator in degrees mode or convert the angle to radians first.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake here. Let me recalculate the sines correctly by converting degrees to radians.

Let me compute each sin(δ_l) with δ_l in radians.

l=0:90 degrees = π/2 radians. sin(π/2)=1.

l=1:67 degrees →67 * π/180 ≈1.16937 radians. sin(1.16937)= approximately 0.920504.

l=2:55 degrees →55 * π/180 ≈0.95993 radians. sin(0.95993)= approx 0.81915.

l=3:30 degrees=π/6≈0.523599 radians. sin(0.523599)=0.5.

l=4:13 degrees→ 13 * π/180≈0.226893 radians. sin(0.226893)≈0.224951.

So the same results as before. So no, sin(67 degrees)=0.9205 is correct. So the earlier calculation holds.

Hmm, but why is the answer not matching any of the options? The closest is option D:251.271 fm, which is about four times my result.

Wait, perhaps I missed a factor of 2 in the formula. Let me think again.

The scattering amplitude f(θ) is given by:

f(θ) = (1/k) sum_{l=0}^∞ (2l+1) sin δ_l P_l(cosθ) e^{2i δ_l}.

But for the imaginary part, Im(f) = (1/k) sum (2l+1) sin δ_l P_l(cosθ), because e^{2iδ_l} = cos(2δ_l) + i sin(2δ_l). So when taking the imaginary part, only the sin(2δ_l) term would contribute, but wait, I'm not sure.

Wait, no, wait. The term in f(θ) is (2l+1) e^{2i δ_l} sin δ_l P_l(cosθ).

Wait, perhaps I'm getting the formula wrong. Let me look up the correct expression.

Upon checking, the scattering amplitude in partial waves is:

f(θ) = (1/(2ik)) sum_{l=0}^\infty (2l+1) e^{2i δ_l} P_l(cosθ).

But in some references, it's written as:

f(θ) = (1/k) sum_{l=0}^\infty (2l+1) sin δ_l P_l(cosθ).

Wait, perhaps I should re-express e^{2i δ_l} as 1 + 2i sin δ_l.

Wait, e^{iθ} = cos θ + i sin θ. So e^{2i δ_l} = cos(2 δ_l) + i sin(2 δ_l).

Hmm, but when taking the imaginary part of f(θ), which is Im(f), perhaps the formula is different.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula for the imaginary part is:

Im(f) = (1/(2k)) sum (2l+1) [sin(2 δ_l) P_l(1) + ...? ]

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think differently.

The scattering amplitude f is a complex quantity. It can be written as f = f_real + i f_imaginary.

The partial wave expansion is:

f(θ) = sum_{l=0}^∞ (2l+1) [ (sin δ_l) P_l(cosθ) ] / (k) × [ (e^{2i δ_l} - 1) ].

Wait, no. Another source says that the scattering amplitude is:

f(θ) = (1/k) sum_{l=0}^\infty (2l+1) e^{2i δ_l} sin δ_l P_l(cosθ).

In this expression, e^{2i δ_l} = cos(2 δ_l) + i sin(2 δ_l).

So when taking the imaginary part:

Im(f) = (1/k) sum (2l+1) [ sin(2 δ_l) sin δ_l P_l(1) ].

Wait, no, because e^{2i δ_l} sin δ_l = [ cos(2 δ_l) + i sin(2 δ_l) ] × sin δ_l.

So the imaginary part would be (1/k) sum (2l+1) [ sin(2 δ_l) × sin δ_l × P_l(1) ].

Wait, but this complicates things. Alternatively, perhaps the initial approach I took was wrong because I considered only the sin δ_l term, but not the exponential factor.

Hmm, perhaps I should go back to the formula.

The correct formula for the scattering amplitude in partial wave expansion is:

f(θ) = (1/k) sum_{l=0}^\infty (2l+1) sin δ_l P_l(cosθ) [1 + i tan δ_l ].

But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, I think the correct expression for the imaginary part is:

Im(f) = (1/k) sum_{l=0}^\infty (2l+1) sin δ_l P_l(1) × ( sin(2 δ_l) ).

Because e^{2i δ_l} = cos(2 δ_l) + i sin(2 δ_l).

So, sin(2 δ_l) = 2 sin δ_l cos δ_l.

Then, Im(f) = (1/k) sum (2l+1) sin δ_l P_l(1) × sin(2 δ_l) )

= (1/k) sum (2l+1) sin δ_l × 2 sin δ_l cos δ_l × P_l(1) )

= (2/k) sum (2l+1) sin² δ_l cos δ_l × P_l(1).

But this is more complicated than what I did earlier. So perhaps I made a mistake in the initial formula.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct expression is:

f(θ) = (1/k) sum (2l+1) sin δ_l P_l(cosθ) e^{2i δ_l}.

Which would have an imaginary part as:

Im(f) = (1/k) sum (2l+1) sin δ_l P_l(cosθ) sin(2 δ_l).

Which for θ=0 (P_l(1)=1), becomes:

Im(f) = (1/k) sum (2l+1) sin δ_l sin(2 δ_l).

Wait, because e^{2i δ_l} = cos(2 δ_l) + i sin(2 δ_l), so the imaginary part is sin(2 δ_l).

So, Im(f) = (1/k) sum (2l+1) sin δ_l sin(2 δ_l).

Hmm, that's different from what I calculated earlier.

So each term is (2l+1) * sin δ_l * sin(2 δ_l).

So let me compute each term again using this formula.

Compute each term:

l=0: (2*0+1)=1, δ=90°.

sin(90°)=1, sin(2*90°)=sin(180°)=0.

So term=1*1*0=0.

l=1:3, δ=67°.

sin(67)=0.9205, sin(134)= sin(180-46)=sin(46)=0.7193.

So term=3 *0.9205 *0.7193≈3 *0.664≈1.992.

l=2:5, δ=55°.

sin(55)=0.8192, sin(110)=sin(70)=0.9397.

So term=5 *0.8192 *0.9397 ≈5 *0.7723≈3.8615.

l=3:7, δ=30°.

sin(30)=0.5, sin(60)=√3/2≈0.8660.

Term=7 *0.5 *0.8660≈7 *0.433≈3.031.

l=4:9, δ=13°.

sin(13)=0.22495, sin(26)=0.4384.

Term=9 *0.22495 *0.4384≈9 *0.0984≈0.8856.

Sum these terms:

l=0:0.

l=1:1.992.

l=2:+3.8615 →5.8535.

l=3:+3.031 →8.8845.

l=4:+0.8856 →9.7701.

So sum is approximately 9.7701.

Multiply by 1/k=3.952569.

So Im(f)=9.7701 *3.952569≈38.73 fm.

But this is still not matching any of the options. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I should compute more accurately.

Compute each term:

l=0: 1 * sin(90) * sin(180) =1 *1*0=0.

l=1:3 * sin(67) * sin(134) =3 *0.9205 *0.7193.

0.9205 *0.7193 ≈0.6638.

3 *0.6638=1.9914.

l=2:5 * sin(55) * sin(110) =5 *0.8192 *0.9397.

0.8192 *0.9397≈0.7723.

5 *0.7723=3.8615.

l=3:7 * sin(30) * sin(60)=7 *0.5 *0.8660=7 *0.433=3.031.

l=4:9 * sin(13) * sin(26) =9 *0.22495 *0.4384.

0.22495 *0.4384≈0.0984.

9 *0.0984≈0.8856.

Sum:

0 +1.9914=1.9914.

+3.8615=5.8529.

+3.031=8.8839.

+0.8856=9.7695.

Multiply by 1/k=3.952569:

9.7695 *3.952569 ≈ let's compute.

9 *3.952569=35.573121.

0.7695 *3.952569≈approx 0.7695*4=3.078, but let's compute accurately:

0.7695 *3.952569.

0.7 *3.952569=2.7667983.

0.06 *3.952569=0.23715414.

0.0095 *3.952569≈0.0375494.

Adding: 2.7667983 +0.23715414=3.0039524 +0.0375494≈3.0415018.

So total Im(f)=35.573121 +3.0415018≈38.61462 fm.

Still not matching any options.

Hmm, perhaps the initial approach was correct, and I just need to recheck the formula.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula for the imaginary part is just (1/k) sum (2l+1) sin δ_l, which I calculated as ~52.89 fm.

But the options don't have that. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of k.

Wait, let me calculate k more accurately.

E=50 MeV.

p = sqrt( (50)^2 - (0.511)^2 ) / c.

But wait, for E=50 MeV, m c^2=0.511 MeV, so E² =50² =2500 (MeV)^2.

m c^2 squared is 0.511²≈0.261 (MeV)^2.

So p c= sqrt(2500 - 0.261) ≈50 MeV.

So p=50 MeV/c.

Then, k= p/(ħ) = (50 MeV/c) / (197.33 MeV·fm) )=50/(197.33) 1/fm ≈0.253 fm^{-1}.

So 1/k ≈3.952569 fm.

So if Im(f)=52.89 fm, but it's not an option, perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps the formula for Im(f) is actually (1/k) sum (2l+1) sin δ_l, but the given phase shifts are in degrees, and I should have converted them to radians first. But no, because I computed the sines correctly in degrees.

Alternatively, perhaps the given phase shifts are in radians, but the question says 90°, so no.

Hmm, I'm stuck. Since none of the options match my calculation, perhaps I made a mistake in the approach.

Wait, another thought: Maybe I should compute the cross-section instead of the amplitude. But the question specifically asks for the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude, so that's not it.

Wait, perhaps the formula for Im(f) is (1/(2k)) sum (2l+1) sin δ_l.

Which would make Im(f) half of what I calculated earlier. So 52.89 /2 ≈26.445 fm, which is still not matching any options.

Hmm.

Wait, looking at the options again, option D is 251.271 fm, which is 50 *5.025, perhaps. Alternatively, perhaps the correct formula involves 2k instead of 1/k. Let's see:

If I use (sum) * (2/k), then 13.3818 * (2/0.253) ≈13.3818 *7.8976≈105.7 fm.

Still not matching options.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the wave number k is 2π/p. Because in some conventions, k = 2π/λ, and p = h/λ → k = 2π p/(h) = p/(ħ).

Which brings me back to the same value.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula for Im(f) includes a factor of 4π, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach: Perhaps the question is about the imaginary part of the amplitude f, which is given by Im(f) = (1/(2k)) sum (2l+1) sin δ_l.

Which would give Im(f)= [13.3818 ] * (1/(2 *0.253)) )=13.3818 * (1/0.506)≈26.445 fm.

Still not matching options.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is Im(f)= (1/k) sum (2l+1) sin δ_l, which is what I had earlier, 52.89 fm. But the options don't have that.

Wait, perhaps the phase shifts are for the real part, and I'm supposed to sum something else. Alternatively, perhaps the phase shifts are multiplied by (2l+1) and summed, but I'm not sure.

Wait, looking for another approach, perhaps the correct answer is option D, 251.271 fm. Let's see what factor would make 52.89 fm into 251.271.

52.89 *4.746 ≈251.27.

Hmm, 4.746 is approximately 15/3.168, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of k. Let me compute k again.

p =50 MeV/c.

k = p/(ħ) =50 / (197.33) (1/fm)≈0.253 fm^-1.

1/k=3.952569 fm.

Wait, perhaps the correct k is (50/ (197.33/2)).

Wait, why would that be? Because sometimes the wave number is defined differently.

Wait, no. Another thought: perhaps the momentum p is in the denominator, so k=p/(ħ c) * c.

Wait, perhaps I should compute k as (p c)/(ħ) → (50 MeV) *c / (197.33 MeV·fm) ) × (1/c) ? No, that would give k in 1/fm.

Wait, no, perhaps I should compute k as (p c)/(ħ c) )= p/(ħ) ), which is what I did earlier.

Hmm.

At this point, I think I must have made a mistake in the initial approach or in the formula. Since the options don't match my calculation, perhaps I should select the closest option, but I'm not confident.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the formula for the imaginary part of f is (1/(2k)) sum (2l+1) sin δ_l.

Which would give Im(f)=13.3818 * (1/(2 *0.253))=13.3818 * (1/0.506)=26.445 fm.

But again, no option matches.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is (1/k) sum (2l+1) [1 - cos(2 δ_l)].

Because sometimes in scattering theory, the real part and imaginary part involve cos and sin terms.

But I'm not certain.

Wait, let me think differently. The standard formula for the total cross-section is:

σ_total = 4π ∫ |f(θ)|² (1/2) sinθ dθ dφ.

But the question is about the imaginary part of f, not the cross-section.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the given phase shifts are for the real part, and the imaginary part is given by something else, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps I should look for a formula of the form Im(f) = (1/k) sum (2l+1) [ sin δ_l ].

Which is what I did earlier.

But given that the options don't match, I'm stuck. Maybe the correct answer is option D, 251.271 fm, but I'm not sure why.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of k. Let me recalculate k in a different way.

E =50 MeV.

The relativistic relation is E = sqrt( (p c)^2 + (m c^2)^2 ).

So, (p c)^2 = E^2 - (m c^2)^2 = (50)^2 - (0.511)^2 ≈2500 -0.261≈2499.739.

p c= sqrt(2499.739)≈49.997 MeV.

So p=49.997 MeV/c.

k = p/(ħ) =49.997 /197.33 ≈0.253 fm^{-1}.

Same as before.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the given phase shifts are for different l values. For example, perhaps δ_o is for l=1, not l=0. But the question states δ_o is 90 degrees, which is for l=0.

Wait, no, the notation is standard: δ_o is for l=0, δ_1 for l=1, etc.

Hmm.

At this point, I think I must have made a mistake somewhere, but I can't find it. However, based on the initial calculation, the answer should be around 52.89 fm, but since that's not an option, I'll have to reevaluate.

Wait, perhaps the phase shifts are being used as δ_l, but the formula requires using δ_l - π/2 or something. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that the formula for the imaginary part is (1/k) * sum (2l+1) [ (1 - cos(2 δ_l)) ].

Which would change the calculation.

For each l:

term = (2l+1) [1 - cos(2 δ_l)].

Compute each:

l=0:1*(1 - cos(180°))=1*(1 - (-1))=2.

l=1:3*(1 - cos(134°)).

cos(134°)=cos(180-46)= -cos(46)= -0.694658.

So 1 - (-0.694658)=1.694658.

3 *1.694658 ≈5.08397.

l=2:5*(1 - cos(110°)).

cos(110)=cos(180-70)= -cos(70)= -0.342020.

1 - (-0.342020)=1.342020.

5 *1.342020≈6.7101.

l=3:7*(1 - cos(60°))=7*(1−0.5)=7*0.5=3.5.

l=4:9*(1 - cos(26°)).

cos(26)=0.898794.

1 -0.898794=0.101206.

9 *0.101206≈0.91085.

Sum all terms:

2 +5.08397=7.08397.

+6.7101=13.79407.

+3.5=17.29407.

+0.91085=18.20492.

Multiply by (1/k)=3.952569.

18.20492 *3.952569≈72.03 fm.

Still not matching any options.

Hmm.

Another possibility: perhaps the formula for the imaginary part is (1/(2k)) times the sum of (2l+1) * sin(2 δ_l).

Which would give:

sum (2l+1) sin(2 δ_l).

Compute each term:

l=0:1 * sin(180)=0.

l=1:3 * sin(134)=3 * sin(46)=3 *0.7193≈2.1579.

l=2:5 * sin(110)=5 *0.9397≈4.6985.

l=3:7 * sin(60)=7 *0.8660≈6.062.

l=4:9 * sin(26)=9 *0.4384≈3.9456.

Sum: 0 +2.1579=2.1579+4.6985=6.8564+6.062=12.9184+3.9456=16.864.

Multiply by (1/(2k))=1/(2*0.253)=1/0.506≈1.976.

So Im(f)=16.864 *1.976≈33.25 fm.

Still not matching any options.

Hmm.

I'm running out of options. Perhaps the correct answer is option D, 251.271 fm, but I can't find a way to reach that number. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial calculation and the correct answer is option D.

Wait, perhaps the formula is Im(f) = (1/k) * sum (2l+1) [ (1 - cos(2 δ_l)) ].

Which for each l:

l=0:1*(1 - cos(180))=2.

l=1:3*(1 - cos(134))=3 * (1 - (-0.694658))=3*(1.694658)=5.08397.

l=2:5*(1 - cos(110))=5*(1 - (-0.3420))=5*(1.342)=6.71.

l=3:7*(1 - cos(60))=7*(0.5)=3.5.

l=4:9*(1 - cos(26))=9*(1-0.8988)=9*(0.1012)=0.9108.

Sum=2+5.08397=7.08397 +6.71=13.79397 +3.5=17.29397 +0.9108=18.20477.

Multiply by (1/k)=3.952569.

18.20477 *3.952569≈72.03 fm.

Still not matching.

I think I'm stuck and may have to select the closest option, but I'm not confident. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial approach and the correct answer is option D, 251.271 fm.

But given that all my calculations lead to around 52.89 fm and none of the options match, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula. Another possibility is that the formula for Im(f) is (1/k) sum (2l+1) sin δ_l, which gives 52.89, but none of the options match. Therefore, I might have to conclude that the correct answer is option D, perhaps due to a miscalculation on my part.


To calculate the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude along the incident beam direction, the formula used is:

\[
\text{Im}(f) = \frac{1}{k} \sum_{l=0}^4 (2l+1) \sin(\delta_l),
\]

where \( k \) is the wave number, and \( \delta_l \) are the given phase shifts. The phase shifts provided are \( \delta_0 = 90^\circ, \delta_1 = 67^\circ, \delta_2 = 55^\circ, \delta_3 = 30^\circ, \delta_4 = 13^\circ \). The wave number \( k \) is calculated using the relativistic relation for the electron's momentum \( p \) at 50 MeV:

\[
p = \frac{E}{c}, \quad k = \frac{p}{\hbar}.
\]

Given \( \hbar c \approx 197.33 \, \text{MeV·fm} \), the wave number is:

\[
k = \frac{50}{197.33} \, \text{fm}^{-1} \approx 0.253 \, \text{fm}^{-1}.
\]

The imaginary part of the scattering amplitude is then computed by summing the contributions from each \( l \)-value:

\[
\text{Im}(f) = \frac{1}{k} \sum_{l=0}^4 (2l+1) \sin(\delta_l).
\]

### Contributions from Each \( l \)-Value:
1. \( l = 0 \): \( (2l+1) = 1, \sin(90^\circ) = 1 \), contribution = \( 1 \cdot 1 = 1 \).
2. \( l = 1 \): \( (2l+1) = 3, \sin(67^\circ) \approx 0.9205 \), contribution = \( 3 \cdot 0.9205 \approx 2.7615 \).
3. \( l = 2 \): \( (2l+1) = 5, \sin(55^\circ) \approx 0.8192 \), contribution = \( 5 \cdot 0.8192 \approx 4.096 \).
4. \( l = 3 \): \( (2l+1) = 7, \sin(30^\circ) = 0.5 \), contribution = \( 7 \cdot 0.5 = 3.5 \).
5. \( l = 4 \): \( (2l+1) = 9, \sin(13^\circ) \approx 0.22495 \), contribution = \( 9 \cdot 0.22495 \approx 2.02455 \).

### Total Sum:
\[
\text{Sum} = 1 + 2.7615 + 4.096 + 3.5 + 2.02455 \approx 13.38205.
\]
