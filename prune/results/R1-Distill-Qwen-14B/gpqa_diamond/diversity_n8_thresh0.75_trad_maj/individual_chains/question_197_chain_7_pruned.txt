Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here. The question is about identifying a compound X based on its IR and NMR data, and then predicting the product when it reacts with red phosphorus and HI. Let me try to break this down step by step.

First, let's look at the IR data. The peaks are at 3400â€“2500 cm-1, which is a broad range, often indicative of O-H or N-H stretches, but in this case, since we're dealing with a reaction that involves HI and red phosphorus, I'm thinking maybe an acid, but let's not jump to conclusions yet. The other peaks are at 1720, 1610, 1450 cm-1. The 1720 cm-1 is a strong peak, which typically corresponds to a carbonyl group (C=O). The 1610 and 1450 cm-1 might be from aromatic rings, possibly C=C stretching or possibly some conjugated carbonyl groups.

Next, the NMR data. The 1H NMR shows several signals. Starting with the 10.5 ppm as a broad singlet (bs, 1H). That's a high chemical shift, which is usually characteristic of an acidic proton, like an -OH group. So that might suggest the compound has a carboxylic acid group. However, wait, let me think. Alternatively, it could be an aldehyde proton, but aldehydes are usually around 9-10 ppm and are sharp, but sometimes broad if there's hydrogen bonding. But in this case, it's a broad signal, which might support an -OH, like a phenolic or carboxylic acid.

Looking at the other signals: 8.0 ppm (d, 2H), 7.2 ppm (d, 2H). Those are typical of a para-substituted benzene ring. The doublets suggest coupling between adjacent protons on the aromatic ring. So maybe para-substituted, like in benzoic acid derivatives or something similar.

Then there's a peak at 2.9 ppm (m, 1H). A multiplet around 3 ppm could be a methylene group adjacent to an oxygen, or perhaps a CH next to an ester or something. Then 1.7 ppm (m, 2H) which is a multiplet integrating to 2H, this might be part of a CH2 group, maybe adjacent to another CH group. The 1.4 ppm (d, 3H) is a triplet of triplets? No, wait, it's a doublet. So a CH3 group attached to something that splits into a doublet. That's typical for a CH3 group attached to a CH2, which is next to another CH. Or perhaps a methyl group attached to an oxygen, but if it's a doublet, that might suggest it's on a CH group.

Finally, 0.9 ppm (t, 3H) is a triplet, which is typical for a terminal methyl group, like in an ethyl chain. So maybe something like -CH2CH2CH3, but wait, the triplet suggests two neighboring groups. So perhaps the ethyl group is attached to another CH2 or CH.

Putting this together, perhaps the structure is a benzoic acid derivative with an ethyl group attached in some way. Let me think: the IR has a carbonyl at 1720, which could be a carboxylic acid (but those usually have a broader peak around 2500-3000 too). Alternatively, it could be an ester or ketone. But wait, the IR also has a strong peak in 1610 and 1450, which are around the range for aromatic C=C. So maybe it's a benzene ring with substituents, including a carbonyl group.

Looking at the NMR, the aromatic protons are para-substituted, so perhaps the substituent is a carbonyl group. The 10.5 ppm peak might be the proton from a carbonyl group, but wait, carboxylic acids have -COOH, which would have a broad peak around 10 ppm. That fits. So the compound could be a benzoic acid with substituents.

Looking at the other protons: 2.9 ppm (m,1H), 1.7 ppm (m,2H), 1.4 ppm (d,3H). Hmm. Let's imagine a chain attached to the benzene. Maybe something like -CH2CH(CH2CH3)COOH? No, wait, perhaps it's a substituent like ethyl or isobutyl attached to the benzene ring.

Wait
