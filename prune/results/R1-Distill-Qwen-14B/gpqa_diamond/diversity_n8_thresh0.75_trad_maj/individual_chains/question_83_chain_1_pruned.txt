Okay, so I have this chemistry problem in front of me, and I'm a bit nervous because titration and pH calculations can be tricky. Let me try to think through this step by step.

The question is about titrating acetic acid with NaOH. The setup is that we have 20.00 cm³ (which is 20 mL) of 0.05 M acetic acid, and then we dilute it with 20.00 cm³ of water. After that, we titrate this solution with 0.1 M NaOH. We need to find the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point.

Hmm, so first things first, I need to figure out the initial concentrations after the dilution. Oh wait, when you mix two volumes, the concentration changes. So the initial solution is diluted by a factor of 2. Let me calculate that.

The initial concentration of acetic acid is 0.05 M. When you mix equal volumes (20 mL each), the total volume becomes 40 mL. So the new concentration would be (0.05 M * 20 mL) / 40 mL. Let me compute that: (0.05 * 20) / 40 = 1 / 40 = 0.0125 M. Okay, so the diluted acetic acid is 0.0125 M.

Next, the titration with NaOH. The NaOH is 0.1 M. So I need to find two things: the pH at 25% titration and the pH at equivalence.

Let me tackle the equivalence point first because that might be simpler. At equivalence, the moles of NaOH added equal the moles of acetic acid present initially.

Wait, but wait. The initial moles of acetic acid after dilution: volume is 40 mL (0.04 L), concentration 0.0125 M. Moles = Molarity * Volume. So 0.0125 * 0.04 = 0.0005 moles. So that's 5e-4 moles of CH3COOH.

NaOH has a concentration of 0.1 M. To find the volume needed to reach equivalence, moles NaOH = moles CH3COOH. So moles NaOH = 0.0005 mol. Volume = moles / concentration = 0.0005 / 0.1 = 0.005 L, which is 5 mL. Wait, but wait, the initial solution is 40 mL, and the titration is done with 25 mL or something? No, no, because the equivalence point is when moles of NaOH equal moles of acid. So regardless of how much is added, the equivalence occurs when 5 mL of NaOH is added to the 40 mL solution. But wait, wait, no, because the initial solution is 40 mL, and each mL of NaOH (volume) is being added. Hmm, but perhaps that's not directly relevant for the equivalence point pH calculation.

At equivalence, all the acetic acid has been neutralized to sodium acetate. So the solution will be a solution of sodium acetate, which is a salt of a weak acid and strong base, so the solution will be basic. The pH will
