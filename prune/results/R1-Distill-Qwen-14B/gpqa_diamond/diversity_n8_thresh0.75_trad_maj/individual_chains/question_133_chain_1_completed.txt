Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The problem states that there's a solution with a volume of 200.00 cm³. It contains 1.00 g of KH₂PO₄ and 1.00 g of Na₂HPO₄·2H₂O. I'm supposed to find the concentration of orthophosphate ions, HPO₄³⁻, in this solution. The temperatures are at 25°C, and they give me the Ka values for H₃PO₄: Ka1 is 7.5e-3, Ka2 is 6.2e-8, and Ka3 is 1.8e-12.

Hmm, okay, so I'm a bit rusty on buffer solutions, but I remember that when you have a weak acid and its conjugate base, you can use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation. But wait, in this case, the problem involves different species of phosphoric acid.

Phosphoric acid, H₃PO₄, can donate three protons, so it has three dissociation steps:

1. H₃PO₄ ⇌ H⁺ + H₂PO₄⁻ (Ka1 = 7.5e-3)
2. H₂PO₄⁻ ⇌ H⁺ + HPO₄²⁻ (Ka2 = 6.2e-8)
3. HPO₄²⁻ ⇌ H⁺ + PO₄³⁻ (Ka3 = 1.8e-12)

But the question is about orthophosphate ions, which I think are HPO₄³⁻. Wait, no, orthophosphate is HPO₄³⁻? Or is that another name? I'm a bit confused. Wait, no, HPO₄³⁻ is the dihydrogen phosphate ion. Orthophosphate is the same as HPO₄³⁻. Or maybe I should double-check that. Alternatively, sometimes orthophosphate refers to H3PO4, but I think in this context, they mean HPO₄³⁻.

Wait, no. Wait, the common terms are: 

- H3PO4 is phosphoric acid (the triply protonated form).
- H2PO4⁻ is dihydrogen phosphate.
- HPO4^2- is hydrogen phosphate.
- PO4^3- is phosphate.

So the question is asking for the concentration of HPO4^2-.

But in the solution, we have KH2PO4 and Na2HPO4·2H2O. So the first compound, KH₂PO₄, is the salt that dissociates into K⁺ and H₂PO₄⁻. The second, Na₂HPO₄·2H₂O, would dissociate into 2 Na⁺ and HPO₄^2- (since the formula is Na2HPO4). So this solution contains H₂PO₄⁻ and HPO₄^2-.

Wait, so we have a solution with H₂PO₄⁻ and HPO₄^2-? That means it's a buffer solution because a weak acid (H₂PO₄⁻) and its conjugate base (HPO₄^2-) are present. So the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation should be applicable here.

The Henderson-Hasselbalch equation is pH = pKa + log([base]/[acid]). But wait, in this case, the acid is H2PO4⁻, which has a pKa of Ka2, since that's the second dissociation. Because the second dissociation is H2PO4⁻ ⇌ H+ + HPO4^2-.

So the pKa we should use is pKa2, which is log(6.2e-8) ≈ 7.21 (since 6.2e-8 is about 10^-7.21). Wait, let me calculate that more accurately. 

Ka2 is 6.2e-8. So pKa2 = -log(6.2e-8) → Let's compute that. Log(6.2) is about 0.79, so 0.79 + 7 (since 1e-8 is 8 decimal places) → 7.79. Wait, no, wait. 6.2e-8 is 6.2 * 10^-8, so the negative log would be 8 - log(6.2). Log(6.2) is approximately 0.792, so 8 - 0.792 = 7.208, so pKa2 is about 7.21.

Now, the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation is pH = pKa + log([base]/[acid]). In this case, the base is HPO4^2- and the acid is H2PO4^-.

But wait, I need to find [HPO4^2-], which is the base. Let's rearrange the equation to solve for the ratio.

But wait, do I know the pH of the solution? Or do I have to calculate it? Hmm. Since I don't know the pH, but I have the concentrations of the acid and the base, perhaps I can find the ratio and then relate it to the concentrations.

Wait, but wait. Alternatively, perhaps I can find the pH using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation because I have the ratio of the base to acid. Then, knowing pH and Ka3, perhaps I can find the concentration of PO4^3-? No, wait, the question is about HPO4^2-, which is the base in this buffer. Hmm.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. The problem is to find the concentration of HPO4^2- in the solution. Let me consider the moles of each.

First, calculate the moles of each component.

Molar mass of KH₂PO₄: K is about 39.10, H2PO4 is 96.97? Wait, no, the Mw is given as 136.09 g/mol. So 136.09 g/mol.

So moles of KH₂PO₄ = 1.00 g / 136.09 g/mol ≈ 0.00735 mol.

Similarly, Na2HPO4·2H2O: Mw is 177.99 g/mol. So moles = 1.00 g / 177.99 g/mol ≈ 0.00561 mol.

Wait, let me compute that more accurately.

For KH₂PO₄:
Molar mass = 136.09 g/mol → 1.00 / 136.09 = approx 0.007355 mol.

Na2HPO4·2H2O: Mw is 177.99 g/mol. So 1.00 / 177.99 = 0.005610 mol.

So in solution, the concentrations of H₂PO4^- and HPO4^2- are each their respective moles divided by the volume in liters.

Volume is 200 cm³ = 0.200 L.

So [H₂PO4^-] = 0.007355 mol / 0.200 L = 0.036775 M.

[HPO4^2-] = 0.005610 mol / 0.200 L = 0.02805 M.

Wait, but that can't be right. Wait, no, because each mole of KH₂PO4 gives one mole of H2PO4^- and one mole of Na2HPO4 gives one mole of HPO4^2-.

So in solution, the concentrations are:

[H2PO4^-] = 0.036775 M,

[HPO4^2-] = 0.02805 M.

So, the buffer solution consists of these two. Now, according to the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation, pH = pKa2 + log([HPO4^2-]/[H2PO4^-]).

We can calculate the ratio [HPO4^2-]/[H2PO4^-] as (0.02805) / (0.036775) ≈ 0.763.

So log(0.763) ≈ -0.117.

So pH = 7.21 + (-0.117) = 7.093.

Hmm, so the pH is approximately 7.093.

But wait, the question is about the concentration of orthophosphate ions, which is HPO4^2-.

Wait, no, no. The solution has HPO4^2- and H2PO4^-.

But wait, the problem is to find [HPO4^2-], which we already have as 0.02805 M.

Wait, but that's the concentration without considering any reactions or activity coefficients. But given that the solution is a buffer, and we're using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation, maybe that's all we need. But wait, is there any other factor that affects this?

Hmm, perhaps I'm missing something. Because the solution contains both H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-, maybe there's another equilibrium to consider.

Wait, but in the buffer solution, the concentrations are governed by the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation, so the ratio is determined by the pKa and the pH. Wait, but in this case, I've calculated the pH based on the initial concentrations, but perhaps that's correct.

Wait, no, because the pH is determined by the buffer, so the ratio [base]/[acid] is determined by the pH and pKa.

Wait, but I think in this case, the concentrations are determined by the initial moles, so [H2PO4^-] and [HPO4^2-] are determined by the amounts of the salts added, so the ratio is fixed.

So, in any case, the [HPO4^2-] is 0.02805 M? But wait, that's 2.8e-2 M, which is much higher than the options given. The options are on the order of 1e-7 M. So something's wrong here. I must have misunderstood the problem.

Wait, maybe the question is about PO4^3- instead of HPO4^2-? Because that would make more sense with the options given.

Wait, let me re-read the question.

The question says: "What is the concentration of orthophosphate ions in this solution?"

Wait, orthophosphate is H3PO4, but more commonly, phosphate ion is PO4^3-. Alternatively, sometimes orthophosphate refers to HPO4^2-? I'm a bit confused about the terminology.

Wait, perhaps I should double-check what orthophosphate refers to. From what I recall, the term orthophosphate usually refers to the fully deprotonated form, PO4^3-.

Wait, but wait, no. Orthophosphoric acid is H3PO4, and its conjugate bases are H2PO4^-, HPO4^2-, and PO4^3-.

So, in this context, orthophosphate ion would be PO4^3-.

Ah, so the question is about PO4^3-.

Hmm, that changes things. Because then, the concentration of PO4^3- would be much lower, especially considering the third dissociation constant.

So, let's reapproach the problem.

We have a solution that contains H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-.

We can imagine that these species can further dissociate into H+ and PO4^3-.

So, the possible reactions are:

H2PO4^- ⇌ H+ + HPO4^2- (Ka2 =6.2e-8)

HPO4^2- ⇌ H+ + PO4^3- (Ka3=1.8e-12)

So, the concentration of PO4^3- will be determined by the third dissociation constant and the concentration of HPO4^2-.

Since the solution is buffered, the pH is around 7.09, as I calculated earlier.

So, since we're dealing with PO4^3-, which comes from the dissociation of HPO4^2-, the concentration can be found using Ka3 and the pH.

The expression for Ka3 is:

Ka3 = [H+][PO4^3-] / [HPO4^2-]

We can rearrange this to solve for [PO4^3-]:

[PO4^3-] = (Ka3 * [HPO4^2-]) / [H+]

We know Ka3 is 1.8e-12.

[H+] can be found from the pH, which we calculated as approximately 7.093. So [H+] = 10^(-pH) ≈ 10^(-7.093).

Let me compute that. 10^-7 is 1e-7. 10^(-0.093) is about 0.87, because log(0.87) ≈ -0.065, but 0.093 is a bit higher. Alternatively, 10^(-0.093) ≈ 0.875. So [H+] ≈ 8.75e-8 M.

Wait, wait, let's compute it more accurately. pH is 7.093, so [H+] = 10^(-7.093) = 10^(-7) * 10^(-0.093).

We know that 10^(-0.093) ≈ 0.875. So [H+] ≈ 8.75e-8 M.

So, [PO4^3-] = (Ka3 * [HPO4^2-]) / [H+]

Plugging in the numbers:

Ka3 = 1.8e-12

[HPO4^2-] is 0.02805 M from earlier.

[H+] is 8.75e-8 M.

So,

[PO4^3-] = (1.8e-12 * 0.02805) / (8.75e-8)

Compute numerator: 1.8e-12 * 0.02805 = approx 5.049e-14.

Divide by 8.75e-8: 5.049e-14 / 8.75e-8 = (5.049 / 8.75) * 1e-6 ≈ 0.577 * 1e-6 = 5.77e-7 M.

Wait, but let me compute it more accurately.

First, calculate 1.8e-12 * 0.02805 = ?

0.02805 is 2.805e-2.

Multiply 1.8e-12 by 2.805e-2: (1.8 * 2.805) = 5.049, so 5.049e-14.

Then, divide by 8.75e-8.

5.049e-14 / 8.75e-8 = (5.049 / 8.75) * 1e-6.

5.049 / 8.75 ≈ 0.577.

So 0.577e-6 = 5.77e-7 M.

Looking at the options:

A) 6.24e-7 M

B) 5.48e-7 M

C) 2.81e-7 M

D) 3.97e-7 M

Hmm, 5.77e-7 is close to option B (5.48e-7) and A (6.24e-7). Hmm, perhaps I made a miscalculation somewhere.

Wait, let me recheck the calculations step by step.

First, the moles:

KH₂PO4: 1.00g / 136.09 g/mol.

Let me compute that more exactly. 136.09 is approx 136.09.

1.00 / 136.09 = ?

Well, 136 * 0.00735 is approximately 1.00, because 136 *0.00735 is about 1.0002. So 0.00735 mol.

Similarly, Na2HPO4·2H2O: 1.00 /177.99 = approx 0.005610 mol.

Volume is 0.200 L.

So [H2PO4^-] = 0.00735 / 0.2 = 0.03675 M.

[HPO4^2-] = 0.00561 / 0.2 = 0.02805 M.

Then, pH = pKa2 + log([HPO4^2-]/[H2PO4^-])

pKa2 is 7.208, as computed earlier.

Ratio = 0.02805 / 0.03675 = 0.763.

Log(0.763) is log(0.763)= approx -0.117.

So pH = 7.208 - 0.117 =7.091.

So [H+] = 10^(-7.091) ≈ 8.31e-8 M. Wait, perhaps I should calculate it more precisely.

Compute 7.091 → [H+] = 10^-7.091.

Let me compute 10^-7.091.

Log(8.31) is about 0.92, but wait, 10^0.92 is about 8.3.

Wait, 7.091 = 7 + 0.091.

So 10^(-7.091) = 1e-7 * 10^(-0.091).

Compute 10^(-0.091). Let me think about log(8) is 0.903, so 10^(-0.091) is 1 / 10^0.091.

10^0.091 is approx 1.23 (since 10^0.1 ≈1.258). Let's compute more accurately.

Using natural logarithm, ln(10^0.091) = 0.091 * ln(10) ≈ 0.091 * 2.302585 ≈ 0.2095.

e^0.2095 ≈ 1.232.

So 10^0.091 ≈1.232 → 1/1.232 ≈0.8115.

So [H+] ≈1e-7 *0.8115 = 8.115e-8 M.

So [H+] =8.115e-8 M.

Now, [PO4^3-] = (Ka3 * [HPO4^2-])/[H+]

Ka3 =1.8e-12.

[HPO4^2-] =0.02805 M.

So,

(1.8e-12 * 0.02805) / (8.115e-8)

First, compute numerator:1.8e-12 *0.02805 = 5.049e-14.

Divide by 8.115e-8 → 5.049e-14 /8.115e-8 = (5.049 /8.115) * 1e-6.

5.049 /8.115 ≈0.622.

So 0.622e-6 → 6.22e-7 M.

Wait, that's 6.22e-7 M, which is close to option A (6.24e-7) or option D (3.97e-7). Hmm, wait, my calculation gives approximately 6.22e-7, which would be near option A.

But wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let's compute 5.049e-14 /8.115e-8 more accurately.

5.049e-14 ÷8.115e-8 = (5.049 /8.115) * (1e-14 / 1e-8) = (0.622) * (1e-6) )= 6.22e-7.

So, [PO4^3-] ≈6.22e-7 M.

Looking at the options, option A is 6.24e-7, which is very close. So the answer should be option A.

Wait, but wait another thing. Did I correctly identify the orthophosphate as PO4^3-? Because the options have higher values than my initial calculation when I thought it was HPO4^2-.

Wait, but when I thought the question was about HPO4^2-, the concentration would have been 0.02805 M, which is not an option. So the question must be about PO4^3-, so the correct approach is the one I did, leading to 6.22e-7 M, which is option A.

But the options given are A) 6.24e-7, B)5.48e-7, etc.

Wait, perhaps I made an error in the pH calculation. Let me recompute the pH.

pH = pKa2 + log([HPO4^2-]/[H2PO4^-])

pKa2=7.208.

Ratio =0.02805 /0.03675 =0.763.

What's log(0.763)? Log(0.7)= -0.1549, log(0.7586)= -0.117.

Wait, perhaps let's compute it more accurately.

log(0.763):

We can use the Taylor expansion or a calculator-like approach.

We know that log(7.63)=0.8835 (since 10^0.8835 ≈7.63).

So log(0.763)= log(7.63e-1) = 0.8835 -1 = -0.1165.

So the pH =7.208 + (-0.1165) =7.0915.

So [H+]=10^-7.0915.

Compute 10^(-7.0915).

Which is 10^(-7) * 10^(-0.0915) =1e-7 * (10^(-0.0915)).

Compute 10^(-0.0915).

We can compute ln(10^(-0.0915))= -0.0915 * ln(10) ≈-0.0915 *2.302585 ≈-0.2106.

So 10^(-0.0915)=e^(-0.2106)≈0.810.

So [H+]≈1e-7 *0.810=8.1e-8 M.

So that's consistent with earlier calculation.

So [PO4^3-]= (1.8e-12 * 0.02805) /8.1e-8.

1.8e-12 *0.02805 =5.049e-14.

Divide by 8.1e-8: 5.049e-14 /8.1e-8 = (5.049/8.1) * 1e-6.

5.049/8.1 = approx 0.6233.

So 0.6233e-6=6.233e-7 M.

Which is approximately 6.23e-7 M, which matches option A (6.24e-7).

So the answer should be option A.


To determine the concentration of orthophosphate ions ([PO₄³⁻]) in the solution, we analyze the buffer system formed by KH₂PO₄ and Na₂HPO₄·2H₂O. The solution contains H₂PO₄⁻ (from KH₂PO₄) and HPO₄²⁻ (from Na₂HPO₄·2H₂O). The orthophosphate ion, PO₄³⁻, is formed through the third dissociation of H₃PO₄, governed by the equilibrium:

\[
\text{HPO₄²⁻} \leftrightharpoons \text{H⁺} + \text{PO₄³⁻}
\]

### Step 1: Calculate moles of H₂PO₄⁻ and HPO₄²⁻
- **Moles of KH₂PO₄**:  
  \[
  \text{Moles} = \frac{\text{Mass}}{\text{Molar Mass}} = \frac{1.00 \, \text{g}}{136.09 \, \text{g/mol}} \approx 0.007355 \, \text{mol}
  \]
  This contributes 0.007355 mol of H₂PO₄⁻.

- **Moles of Na₂HPO₄·2H₂O**:  
  \[
  \text{Moles} = \frac{\text{Mass}}{\text{Molar Mass}} = \frac{1.00 \, \text{g}}{177.99 \, \text{g/mol}} \approx 0.005610 \, \text{mol}
  \]
  This contributes 0.005610 mol of HPO₄²⁻.

### Step 2: Calculate concentrations of H₂PO₄⁻ and HPO₄²⁻
The total volume of the solution is 200.00 cm³ = 0.200 L.  
- \[
  [\text{H₂PO₄⁻}] = \frac{\text{Moles of H₂PO₄⁻}}{\text{Volume}} = \frac{0.007355}{0.200} \approx 0.036775 \, \text{M}
\]
- \[
  [\text{HPO₄²⁻}] = \frac{\text{Moles of HPO₄²⁻}}{\text{Volume}} = \frac{0.005610}{0.200} \approx 0.02805 \, \text{M}
\]

### Step 3: Use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation to find pH
The buffer system involves H₂PO₄⁻ (acid) and HPO₄²⁻ (base), with the second dissociation constant of H₃PO₄, \( \text{Ka}_2 = 6.2 \times 10^{-8} \).  
\[
\text{pKa}_2 = -\log(\text{Ka}_2) = -\log(6.2 \times 10^{-8}) \approx 7.21
\]
The Henderson-Hasselbalch equation is:
\[
\text{pH} = \text{pKa}_2 + \log\left(\frac{[\text{HPO₄²⁻}]}{[\text{H₂PO₄⁻}]}\right)
\]
Substitute the values:
\[
\text{pH} = 7.21 + \log\left(\frac{0.02805}{0.036775}\right)
\]
\[
\text{pH} = 7.21 + \log(0.763) \approx 7.21 - 0.117 = 7.093
\]

### Step 4: Calculate [PO₄³⁻] using \( \text{Ka}_3 \)
The third dissociation constant of H₃PO₄ is \( \text{Ka}_3 = 1.8 \times 10^{-12} \). The equilibrium expression is:
\[
\text{Ka}_3 = \frac{[\text{H⁺}][\text{PO₄³⁻}]}{[\text{HPO₄²⁻}]}
\]
Rearranging for \([\text{PO₄³⁻}]\):
\[
[\text{PO₄³⁻}] = \frac{\text{Ka}_3 \cdot [\text{HPO₄²⁻}]}{[\text{H⁺}]}
\]
From the pH, \([\text{H⁺}] = 10^{-\text{pH}} = 10^{-7.093} \approx 8.115 \times 10^{-8} \, \text{M}\). Substituting values:
\[
[\text{PO₄³⁻}] = \frac{(1.8 \times 10^{-12}) \cdot (0.02805)}{8.115 \times 10^{-8}}
\]
\[
[\text{PO₄³⁻}] = \frac{5.049 \times 10^{-14}}{8.115 \times 10^{-8}} \approx 6.22 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M}
\]

### Step 5: Match with the closest option
The calculated concentration of \([\text{PO₄³⁻}]\) is approximately \(6.22 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M}\), which matches **Option A** (\(6.24 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M}\)).

Answer: A
