Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here. Let me try to figure it out step by step. Hmm, I remember that in quantum mechanics, the wave function must satisfy certain conditions. Oh right, the normalization condition. The total probability of finding the particle somewhere must be 1. So the integral of the square of the absolute value of the wave function over all space should equal 1.

The wave function given is (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i. Wait, but wait, the wave function is a complex function. So to find the probability, I need to compute the modulus squared. That would be (a/sqrt(1+x))^2 + (0.5)^2, right? Because when you take the absolute value squared of a complex number a + ib, it's a² + b².

But wait, the problem says that when measuring the position, none were found outside x=1 to x=3. That means the wave function is zero outside this region, but the given wave function is valid where the particle can exist. Oh, no, wait, more accurately, the wave function is only non-zero between x=1 and x=3. So the integration limits for normalization should be from x=1 to x=3.

So the normalization condition is the integral from 1 to 3 of |ψ(x)|² dx = 1.

Let me write out |ψ(x)|². ψ(x) = a/sqrt(1+x) - 0.5i. So |ψ|² is [ (a/sqrt(1+x))^2 + (0.5)^2 ].

Wait, no, wait a minute. Because (a/sqrt(1+x)) is the real part, and (0.5i) is the imaginary part. So the absolute value squared is (Re(ψ))^2 + (Im(ψ))^2. So yes, (a^2)/(1+x) + (0.5)^2.

So the integral from 1 to 3 of [ (a²)/(1+x) + 0.25 ] dx = 1.

I can split this integral into two parts: integral of a²/(1+x) dx plus integral of 0.25 dx, both from 1 to 3.

Let me compute each part.

First part: a² ∫ dx/(1+x) from 1 to 3.

The integral of 1/(1+x) dx is ln(1+x). So evaluating from 1 to 3 gives ln(4) - ln(2) = ln(
