Okay, so I have this physics problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me read it again. The question is about a light beam moving through a glass with a certain index of refraction, and the glass itself is moving at a constant velocity. The question is asking about the speed of the light relative to an observer in the lab.

Hmm, I remember that the speed of light in a medium is given by v = c/n, where c is the speed of light in a vacuum and n is the refractive index. But wait, this is when the medium is stationary relative to the observer. But in this case, the glass is moving.

So the glass is moving at velocity v in the same direction as the light beam. The observer is in the lab, so we have to consider the glass's motion relative to the lab. Wait, the light is propagating through the glass, and the glass is moving toward the observer. So both the light and the glass are moving in the same direction as the beam's propagation.

I'm a bit confused about whether to apply special relativity here. Because when velocities are significant compared to the speed of light, we can't just add them linearly. But the problem says the speed of light in vacuum is c=1, so I guess the speed of the glass is v, which might be much less than c, so maybe we can use the Galilean transformation, but wait, noâ€”Galilean doesn't apply at high speeds. Wait, but if the speed v is not close to c, maybe it's okay. Or perhaps the problem assumes that the speed is non-relativistic, so we can use the addition of velocities in a certain way.

Wait, but light's speed
