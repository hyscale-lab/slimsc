Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about enthalpy of neutralization. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

The question is asking me to calculate the enthalpy when mixing three solutions: HCl, H2SO4, and Ba(OH)2. The volumes and molarities are given. I remember that neutralization reactions involve acids and bases reacting to form water. The enthalpy of neutralization is usually the heat released when an acid reacts with a base to produce one mole of water. But wait, in this case, there are multiple acids and a base. So I need to figure out which ones will react and in what amounts.

First, let me list out the reactants. We have HCl, which is a strong acid, and H2SO4, which is also a strong acid. Then there's Ba(OH)2, which is a strong base. So the reaction will be between the acids and the base.

I should calculate the moles of each acid and the base. Moles are calculated as molarity multiplied by volume (in liters).

For HCl: 0.2 M * 0.5 L = 0.1 moles. HCl is a monoprotic acid, so each mole gives one H+.

H2SO4: 0.3 M * 0.3 L = 0.09 moles. H2SO4 is diprotic, so each mole can donate two H+ ions. So total H+ from H2SO4 is 0.09 * 2 = 0.18 moles.

Ba(OH)2: 0.5 M * 0.2 L = 0.1 moles. Ba(OH)2 is a strong base and is diprotic (since each molecule has two OH- ions). So each mole gives two OH- ions. So total OH- is 0.1 * 2 = 0.2 moles.

Wait, but when mixing an acid and a base, the H+ and OH- will react in a 1:1 ratio. So the total H+ from both acids is 0.1 (from HCl) + 0.18 (from H2SO4) = 0.28 moles H+. The OH- is 0.2 moles. 

So the OH- is the limiting reagent here. Because 0.28 moles H+ and 0.2 moles OH- will completely react. So all the OH- will react, and there will be excess H+ left.

The reaction is H+ + OH- → H2O, and the enthalpy change per mole of H2O is usually around -57 kJ/mol (but wait, sometimes it's given as -55.8 or so, but I'll go with -57 for now). Oh wait, but I'm not sure if it's per mole of H+ or something else. Let me think: the enthalpy of neutralization for a strong acid and strong base is about -57 kJ per mole of H2O formed. So each mole of H+ reacting with OH- releases 57 kJ.

So, in this case, 0.2 moles of H+ (since OH- is 0.2) will react. So the total enthalpy change is 0.2 moles * (-57 kJ/mol) = -11.4 kJ. Wait, but the options are in kcal and kJ. Oh wait, the options are a mix. Let me check the options again.

Looking at the options: option D is -16.0 kJ, which is higher than my -11.4. Wait, perhaps I made a miscalculation.

Wait, maybe I should think about the equivalents. Because when dealing with H2SO4, each mole contributes two equivalents of H+.

Wait, but in terms of neutralization, each mole of H+ reacts with OH-.

Wait, maybe I should approach this differently. Let's calculate the equivalents of acid and base.

Equivalents of acid: HCl has 0.2 M * 0.5 L = 0.1 eq (since 1 H+ per mole). H2SO4 has 0.3 M * 0.3 L * 2 = 0.18 eq. Total acid equivalents: 0.1 + 0.18 = 0.28 eq.

Base equivalents: Ba(OH)2 is 0.5 M * 0.2 L * 2 (because each mole gives 2 OH-) = 0.2 eq.

So the neutralization reaction will happen between equivalents. So 0.28 eq acid and 0.2 eq base. The reaction will consume 0.2 eq of acid and 0.2 eq of base.

Wait, but wait, neutralization is H+ + OH- → H2O. So each equivalent is a mole of H+ or OH-.

So the acid provides 0.28 equivalents of H+, and the base provides 0.2 equivalents of OH-. So the OH- will be the limiting reagent. All 0.2 equivalents of OH- will react, consuming 0.2 equivalents of H+.

So the total moles of H2O formed is 0.2 moles. Therefore, the enthalpy change is 0.2 * (-
