Okay, so I've got this question about stellar abundances, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it. Let me read the problem again.

So, there are two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. Their masses are 1.5 and 1.2 times that of the Sun, but I don't think mass matters here since the question is about elemental ratios. The question gives me some abundance ratios using the EW method, which I think stands for Equivalent Width, a technique for determining element abundances in stellar spectra.

The given abundances are [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 dex, [Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3 dex, [Fe/H]_1 = 0 dex, and [Mg/H]_2 = 0 dex. I remember that these bracket notations are logarithmic, with the base being 10. So, [X/Y] = log10(n_X / n_Y) relative to the Sun.

The Sun's photospheric composition is given: 12 + log10(nFe/nH) =7.5 and similarly 12 + log10(nMg/nH)=7. I think this means that the log of (nFe/nH) is 7.5 - 12 = -4.5. Wait, wait, no, that doesn't make sense. Let me think. The notation is probably [X/H] = log(n_X / n_H) - log(n_X / n_H)_sun. Or wait, no, the way it's presented here, 12 + log10(nFe/nH) equals 7.5. So, that would mean log10(nFe/nH) = 7.5 -12 = -4.5. So nFe/nH is 10^(-4.5). Similarly, for Mg, log10(nMg/nH) is 7 -12 = -5, so 10^-5.

I need to find the ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2. So, that would be [Si/Star_1] / [Si/Star_2], wait no, the ratio is (n_Si_1 / n_Si_2), but wait, actually, the question is the ratio of silicon atoms, so [n_Si_1 / n_Si_2] = ?

Wait, no, the question is the ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2. So, that's (n_Si1 / n_Si2).

Wait, but I don't have [Si/Fe] for Star_2 or [Mg/Si] for Star_1. Hmm. Let me look at the given data again.

For Star_1:
- [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 dex. So that's log10(n_Si1 / n_Fe1) - log10(n_Si_sun / n_Fe_sun) = 0.3. Since [Fe/H]_1 is 0, that means [Fe/H] is the log of (n_Fe1 / n_H) relative to the Sun. So [Fe/H]_1 = 0 implies n_Fe1/n
