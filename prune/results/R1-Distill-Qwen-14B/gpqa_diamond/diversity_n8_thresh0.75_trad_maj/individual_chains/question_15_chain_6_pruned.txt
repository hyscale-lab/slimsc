Okay, so I've got this question about exoplanet transits and which planet is more likely to transit from our point of view. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through.

So, the setup is that there are two Earth-like planets, Planet_1 and Planet_2. The researchers want to observe the one with the highest probability of transiting because they have limited time. Both have been detected via the radial velocity (RV) method, so we know their minimum masses and orbital periods.

The key points given are:
- Both have the same mass.
- Planet_1's orbital period is three times shorter than Planet_2's. So if Planet_2 has a period of P, Planet_1 has P/3.
- Both have circular orbits.
- The host stars have the same radii, but Planet_1's star is more massive (twice the mass of Planet_2's host). Wait, but same radii? That's interesting because more massive stars are usually larger, but maybe Planet_1's star hasn't expanded yet since it's earlier in its life.

Wait, the question says the host of Planet_2 is slightly evolved, so maybe Planet_2's star is a bit bigger? But no, the stars have the same radii, so both stars are similar in size even though Planet_1's star is more massive (twice as much). Hmm, that might have implications for their brightness or other factors, but right now I'm focusing on the transit probability.

Transit probability depends on the alignment of the planet's orbit with our line of sight. The formula for the probability, as I remember, is roughly (R_star + R_planet)^2 / (a^2), where a is the semi-major axis. But wait, more accurately, the probability is proportional to (R_star / a)² multiplied by (1/(1 - e²))^(3/2), but since e=0 here (circular orbits), it's just (R_star / a)^2. But wait, I think the exact formula is (R_s / a)^2 multiplied by another factor that depends on the inclination, but perhaps for the purpose of comparing the probabilities between the two planets, we can model them as independent probabilities based on the geometry.

Wait, no, more accurately, the transit probability is the ratio of the area of the star to the area of the orbit's cross-section. So, the probability P is (R_star + R_planet)^2 / (a^2), but since Earth's radius is much smaller than the
