Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about elastic scattering of electrons. I'm a bit rusty on this topic, but I'll try to think it through.

The question gives me phase shifts δ₀ through δ₄, with δ₀=90°, δ₁=67°, δ₂=55°, δ₃=30°, and δ₄=13°. The rest are ignored. The incident electrons have an energy of 50 MeV, and I'm supposed to calculate the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude along the incident beam direction. The options are A to D, but I'm not sure which one is correct.

Hmm, I remember that in scattering theory, the scattering amplitude f(θ) is a complex function. The imaginary part of the amplitude is related to the total cross-section. Oh wait, and for elastic scattering, the imaginary part is connected to the phase shifts.

The formula I think I need is something like the imaginary part of the amplitude f, Im f, being proportional to the sum of the phase shifts. Wait, more specifically, I recall that the imaginary part is given by (1/(2k)) times the sum of (sin δ_l) multiplied by the square root of the orbital angular momentum quantum number plus 1, all multiplied by some other terms. Or wait, maybe it's the sum of the sine of each phase shift δ_l multiplied by some other factors.

Oh right, I think the formula is Im f = (1/(2k)) * sum_{l=0}^∞ [ (2l + 1) sin δ_l ] * (something else?), but wait, another thought: I remember that the differential cross-section in the case of elastic scattering (with no inelastic channels) is given by the sum over all l of ( (2l + 1) sin^2 δ_l ) / (sin θ)² or something like that. Wait, no, the differential cross-section formula is (dσ/dΩ) = (1/(k^2)) sum_{l=0}^∞ (2l + 1) (sin δ_l)^2 P_l(cos θ)). But that's for the differential cross-section, not the amplitude.

Wait, the amplitude f(θ) in the case of elastic scattering is given by f(θ) = (1/k) sum_{l=0}^∞ (2l + 1) e^{2iδ_l} P_l(cos θ). Or wait, I think the expression is f(θ) = (1/k) sum (2l + 1) sin δ_l [e^{2iδ_l} + 1 ] / (2i) ? No, maybe I'm mixing things up.

Wait, let's go back. The general expression for the scattering amplitude in the case of partial waves is f(θ) = sum_l ( (2l + 1)/(k) ) (e^{2iδ_l} - 1) P_l(cosθ). Because when you have e^{2iδ} - 1 = 2i e^{iδ} sin δ. So then f(θ) would be sum_l (2i (2l + 1)/(k) ) e^{iδ_l} sin δ_l P_l(cosθ). Therefore, the imaginary part of f(θ) would be the sum of (2(2l + 1)/(k)) e^{iδ_l} sin δ_l P_l(cosθ).
