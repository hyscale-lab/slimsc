Okay, so I've got this question about stellar abundances and ratios of elements in two stars. Hmm, it's a bit complicated, but I'll try to break it down step by step. Let's see what the question says.

So, there are two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. Their masses are 1.5 and 1.2 times that of the Sun, but I'm not sure how that plays into this problem. Maybe it's a red herring, or maybe it's about their lifespans and where they are in the galaxy, but perhaps not directly relevant to the abundances calculation here. Let's focus on the abundance data.

The question gives me some elemental abundance ratios using the EW method, which I think stands for Equivalent Width. But wait, the method probably isn't crucial here; I just need to use the given abundance values.

The given data:
- [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 dex. So, the abundance of silicon relative to iron in Star_1 is 0.3 dex higher than the Sun. Because the brackets notation is [X/Y] = log10(n_X/n_Y) - log10(n_X/n_Y)_sun. So, [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 means in Star_1, Si is 10^0.3 times more abundant relative to Fe compared to the Sun.
- [Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3 dex. So, Star_2 has Mg abundance relative to Si that's 0.3 dex higher than the Sun.
- [Fe/H]_1 = 0. So, the abundance of Fe relative to H (hydrogen) in Star_1 is the same as in the Sun. So, [Fe/H]_1 is 0, meaning Fe is solar abundance.
- [Mg/H]_2 = 0. So, Mg in Star_2 is at solar abundance relative to H.

The Sun's composition is given as:
- 12 + log10(nFe/nH) = 7.5 → so log10(nFe/nH) = 7.5 -12 = -4.5 → nFe/nH = 10^(-4.5).
- 12 + log10(nMg/nH) = 7 → log10(nMg/nH) = 7-12 = -5 → nMg/nH = 10^(-5).

Wait, what's the question again? It asks for the ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2. So, n_Si,1 / n_Si,2. Or is it the other way around? The question says, "the ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2." So, I think it's Star_1's silicon divided by Star_2's silicon.

Let me think about how to get [Si/H] for each star because once I have that, I can find the ratio of Si in each and then divide them.

Let me start with Star_1.

For Star_1:
[Fe/H]_1 is 0, so [Fe/H]_1 = 0 → log10(nFe_1 / nH_1) - log10(nFe_sun / nH_sun) ) = 0 → nFe_1/nH_1 = nFe_sun / nH_sun. So, Fe abundance is the same as the Sun.

We have [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3. Let's express [Si/Fe] as log10(nSi/nFe) - log10(nSi_sun/nFe_sun) ) = 0.3.

Wait, wait, the brackets notation is [X/Y] = log(nX/nY) - log(nX/nY)_sun. So, [Si/Fe]_1 = log(nSi1/nFe1) - log(nSi_sun/nFe_sun) ) = 0.3.

But since for Star_1, [Fe/H] is 0, so nFe1 / nH1 = nFe_sun / nH_sun → nFe1 = (nFe_sun / nH_sun)
