Okay, so I have this physics problem about a relativistic harmonic oscillator. Hmm, I remember that a harmonic oscillator is a system that experiences a restoring force proportional to its displacement, like F = -kx. But wait, this is a relativistic version, so I guess we have to consider special relativity effects here.

The question asks for the maximum speed of the mass, v_max. The options are A, B, C, D. I need to figure out which one is correct.

In the non-relativistic case, the maximum speed of a harmonic oscillator occurs when all the potential energy is converted into kinetic energy. The potential energy in a harmonic oscillator is (1/2)kA², where A is the amplitude. So the maximum speed would be when this potential energy is converted into kinetic energy, which is (1/2)mv². Setting them equal: (1/2)kA² = (1/2)mv² → v = sqrt(kA²/m). So that's option C. But wait, this is in the non-relativistic case. The question is about the relativistic case.

In special relativity, the kinetic energy isn't just (1/2)mv² anymore. The relativistic kinetic energy is (γ - 1)mc², where γ is the Lorentz factor: 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²). So the energy considerations are different.

The total energy of a relativistic harmonic oscillator would be the sum of rest mass energy and kinetic energy. But wait, in the case of the harmonic oscillator, the total energy is quantized, but maybe that's not important here since we're dealing with maximum speed. Alternatively, perhaps we can model it using the relativistic equation of motion.

The equation of motion for a relativistic harmonic oscillator is different. For a non-relativistic oscillator, F = -kx, so m d²x/dt² = -kx. But relativistically, the equation would involve the momentum in a way that incorporates γ. Let me think: the force F is d(p)/dt, where p is
