Okay, so I've got this question about stars and how their number per unit range of parallax changes with parallax. Hmm, let's see. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

Parallax is a measure of how far away a star is from us. Right, the formula I remember is that the distance (d) in parsecs is the reciprocal of the parallax (plx), so d = 1 / plx. Oh wait, no, wait—parallax is in arcseconds, and distance is in parsecs. So if a star has a parallax of 1 arcsecond, it's 1 parsec away. If it's 0.5 arcseconds, it's twice as far, so 2 parsecs. Yeah, that makes sense.

Now, the question says stars are uniformly distributed in the sky. So uniform distribution in space means that the number density of stars doesn't depend on distance. Wait, no—uniform distribution might mean that stars are equally likely to be found in any direction, but how does that affect their number per unit parallax?

Wait, let's think about the volume of space at a certain distance. The number of stars depends on the volume because if you have a certain number density (n), the number of stars in a volume V would be n*V. So, if you have a spherical shell at a distance d with thickness dr, the volume is 4πr² dr, right? So the number of stars in that shell would be n * 4πd² dr.

But parallax plx is 1/d. So d = 1/plx. So when plx increases, d decreases, meaning we're looking at closer stars. So for a given change in parallax, say from plx to plx + dplx, what's the corresponding change in distance?

Let me think about how the distance changes with plx. Since plx = 1/d, then d = 1/plx. So if plx increases by a small amount dplx, the change in d would be... Hmm, maybe using differentials would help. Let's say d = 1/plx, so dd = - (1/plx²) dplx. Wait, but I'm not sure if that's the right approach here.

Alternatively, maybe I should express the number of stars per unit parallax. So the number of stars between parallax plx and plx + dplx would be the number of stars in that distance shell. The distance shell goes from d = 1/plx to d = 1/(
