Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question is about.

The problem involves a series of reactions starting with 1,3-dibromoadamantane. Hmm, I remember adamantane has a diamondoid structure, kind of a cage-like structure. So, 1,3-dibromoadamantane has bromine atoms at the 1 and 3 positions.

First reaction: Heating with excess KOH at 240Â°C. I think when vicinal dihalides (two halogens on adjacent carbons) react with KOH, they undergo elimination to form alkenes via an E2 mechanism. Wait, but 1,3-dibromoadamantane isn't vicinal. Oh wait, no, in adamantane, the positions are such that 1 and 3 might be across from each other. Hmm, maybe it's actually a diepoxide or something else? Or perhaps the reaction leads to a ketone?

Wait, another thought: maybe it's a dehydrohalogenation, but with two bromines. Oh wait, maybe it's a Dieckmann elimination? No, Dieckmann is for cyclic ketones. Alternatively, maybe it's a double elimination. Wait, when you have two bromines on adjacent carbons, KOH would cause elimination to form an alkene. But 1,3-dibromoadamantane... wait, maybe the structure is such that elimination leads to a bridge structure.

But I'm a bit confused. Let me think again. So 1,3-dibromoadamantane, when heated with KOH (a strong base), probably undergoes dehydrohalogenation. Since there are two bromines, maybe two eliminations happen. Wait, but elimination usually needs adjacent leaving groups. Are 1 and 3 adjacent on the adamantane structure? I think adamantane has a structure where each carbon is connected to three others. So, perhaps 1 and 3 are on opposite ends, but not adjacent. Hmm, maybe the elimination isn't straightforward.

Wait, the product is a light yellow solid. Oh, wait, sometimes when vicinal dihalides eliminate, they form alkenes. But since the product is a solid and the IR has a peak at 1720 cm^-1, which suggests a carbonyl group, like a ketone or maybe an ester. Because 1720 is around where ketones absorb. So maybe it's not an elimination but a substitution?

Wait, another possibility. When a dihal
