Okay, so I have this chemistry problem about finding the concentration of calcium ions in a solution. Hmm, let's see. The question says the solution contains 0.02 M of a stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex. And the K for the Ca-EDTA complex is 5x10^10. The options are A to D. 

Wait, I remember that EDTA is a chelating agent, right? It forms complexes with metal ions like Ca²+. So when they talk about a Ca-EDTA complex, they're probably referring to the complex where EDTA is bound to Ca²+. 

The problem gives me the concentration of the complex and the formation constant, K. So I think I need to use the K expression to find the concentration of free calcium ions. 

The complex is probably in a 1:1 ratio, like CaY²−, where Y is EDTA. So the formation reaction would be something like Ca²+ + EDTA^4− ↔ CaEDTA^2−. The K for this reaction is given as 5e10, which is a pretty large number, so the complex is stable, meaning not much free Ca²+ would be left. 

The formation constant K is defined as [CaEDTA²−]/([Ca²+][EDTA^4−]) = 5e10. 

But wait, the solution has 0.02 M of the Ca-EDTA complex. So [CaEDTA²−] is 0.02 M. Let's denote [Ca²+] as x, and [EDTA^4−] as y. 

But wait, in the solution, there might be other forms of EDTA, like HEDTA, depending on the pH. Oh, but the question says the pH is ideal, which probably means that EDTA is in its Y^4− form. So I don't have to worry about the different protonated forms. So [EDTA^4−] is just y. 

So the equation becomes K = (0.02)/(x * y) = 5e10. 

But wait, I need to find x, which is [Ca²+]. But I have two variables here, x and y. How do I proceed? 

Wait a minute, the solution is made by dissolving the Ca-EDTA complex. So initially, the solution is only CaEDTA^2−. So when it's dissolved, it dissociates into Ca²+ and EDTA^4−. 

Wait, no, that's not correct. No, actually, the complex is already formed, so when you dissolve it, it's in solution as CaEDTA²−. The dissociation is the reverse of the formation reaction. 

So, the initial concentration of CaEDTA²− is 0.02 M. Then it dissociates into Ca²+ and EDTA^4−. Let me think about that. 

At equilibrium, [CaEDTA²−] = 0.02 - some amount, but wait, wait, no. Because when the complex dissociates, each mole produces one mole of Ca²+ and one mole of EDTA^4−. So if the complex dissociates by α (a small fraction), then the changes would be:

[CaEDTA²−]: 0.02 (1 - α)
[Ca²+]: α * 0.02
[EDTA^4−]: α *
