Okay, I've got this chemistry problem to work through. Let me try to break it down step by step. I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, but I'll give it a shot.

So, the problem describes a series of reactions, and I need to figure out the molecular symmetry group of product E. Hmm. I remember that molecular symmetry groups are about the different ways a molecule can be symmetrical, like how many axes of rotation or planes of symmetry it has.

Let me start by listing out the reactions and see if I can figure out the chemical identities of each substance. Maybe if I can identify what E is, I can determine its symmetry.

The first reaction is solid A reacting with 8 equivalents of gas B to form bright red product C. I'm thinking about compounds that form bright red products. Oh, maybe something like sulfur reacting with something? Or perhaps a transition metal compound. Wait, another thought: I remember that when a metal reacts with chlorine, it can form a chloride. But I'm not sure about the 8 equivalents part.

Wait, another possibility: Maybe A is sodium sulfide (Na2S) reacting with B as chlorine gas (Cl2). But that's a stretch. Alternatively, perhaps A is a metal sulfide and B is oxygen? No, oxygen is O2, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe A is something like iron(III) oxide reacting with Cl2? No, not sure.

Wait, the product C is bright red. That makes me think of something like mercury(II) oxide, which is red, but I'm not certain. Alternatively, maybe it's a transition metal sulfide. Wait, another idea: Copper(II) oxide is black, but maybe some other compound. Oh! Wait, maybe C is lead(IV) oxide, which is dark brown, but not bright red. Hmm. Alternatively, the reaction might involve something like phosphorus and oxygen forming P4O10, but I don't think that's red.

Wait, perhaps it's a reaction involving iodine. Iodine is a bright purple solid, but if it's a product, maybe. Alternatively, maybe it's a metal reacting with something to form a red compound.

Wait, perhaps A is sodium sulfide (Na2S) reacting with B as bromine (Br2). Hmm, but not sure. Another thought: Maybe A is sodium oxide (Na2O) and B is O2, but that doesn't fit. Alternatively, maybe A is FeS and B is Cl2, but FeCl2 is green, and FeCl3 is yellowish. Hmm.

Wait, another angle: The second reaction is C reacting with 2 equivalents of gas D to produce product E, which is extremely hazardous. So E must be a dangerous compound. Maybe something like phosgene, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, could E be something like sarin gas? No, that's too specific. Or perhaps something like chlorine trifluoride, which is highly reactive. Or maybe E is something like HCl gas, but that doesn't sound right.

Wait, let's look at the third reaction: C reacts with water to form A plus two different acids F and G. F is a strong acid, G is a weak acid. So when C is hydrolyzed, it produces A and two acids. If C is a chloride, maybe, but perhaps it's a sulfide or another compound.

Wait, suppose C is a sulfide. If C reacts with water, it might produce H2S (which is a weak acid, but wait, H2S is a weak acid, but maybe that's G). But then, if F is a strong acid, perhaps HCl. That would suggest that C has both Cl and S in it. Alternatively, maybe C is a metal sulfide that reacts with water to produce H2S and a metal hydroxide, which might be a strong base, but the question says acids F and G. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps C is a nitride. For example, if A is sodium nitride (NaN3), but that's less common. Alternatively, maybe C is a metal oxide. Wait, when metal oxides react with water, they form metal hydroxides which are bases, not acids. So that can't be it.

Wait, perhaps C is a metal sulfide. Let me think: For example, if C is Na2S, then reacting with water would produce 2NaOH (a strong base) and H2S (a weak acid). But in the question, F and G are acids, both, so that can't be right because NaOH is a base.

Hmm. Maybe C is a metal chloride. Wait, another approach: Let's think about the reactions.

First reaction: A (solid) + 8 B (gas) → C (bright red)
Second: C + 2 D (gas) → E (extremely hazardous)
Third: C + H2O → A + F (strong acid) + G (weak acid)
Fourth: D + B → H (solvent)

Let me look at the fourth reaction: D reacts with B in a 1:1 ratio to form H, which is a solvent. Solvents are things like water, ethanol, ether, etc. If B is a diatomic gas, perhaps B is O2, and D is H2, but then H would be H2O. But wait, D and B reacting in 1:1 ratio: say, D is H2 and B is O2, then H would be H2O. That's a possibility. Alternatively, maybe B is Cl2 and D is something else.

Wait, if B is Cl2 and D is NH3, but then 1:1 would need to give a product. Alternatively, maybe B is O2 and D is C (carbon), but that would form CO or CO2, but that's not a solvent. Hmm.

Alternatively, if B is Cl2 and D is CH4, but that would probably form something else. Wait, another thought: If B is O2 and D is H2, then H would be H2O, which is a solvent. That could fit.

So, if B is O2 and D is H2, then in the fourth reaction, they combine 1:1 to form H2O, which is a solvent. That seems plausible. But then, in the first reaction, A reacts with 8 equivalents of O2 to form C, which is bright red.

Wait, what's a bright red solid that forms from a reaction involving O2? Maybe something like FeO(OH)·nH2O? No, that's usually green. Another thought: Maybe A is PbS, which is lead sulfide, which is dark brown. When it reacts with O2, perhaps it oxidizes to PbO2, which is dark brown as well. Hmm, not bright red.

Wait, maybe A is a metal, and B is Cl2. So, for example, A is Fe, B is Cl2, and C is FeCl3, which is yellow. But the problem says C is bright red. Hmm, not matching.

Alternatively, perhaps A is HgO (mercury(II) oxide), which is red. If HgO reacts with Cl2, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps A is a metal oxide that reacts with Cl2: but I'm not certain.

Wait, another angle: The third reaction is C + H2O → A + F (strong acid) + G (weak acid). So, if C is a sulfide, that would produce H2S (weak acid) and a metal hydroxide. But that can't be because F and G are both acids, so that would require the metal hydroxide to be an acid, which is not possible.

Wait, perhaps C is a nitride. For example, if C is Mg3N2, then reacting with water would give Mg(OH)2 and NH4OH. Wait, NH4OH is a weak acid (since NH4+ is a weak acid). Mg(OH)2 is a base, but the problem says F and G are acids. So that doesn't fit.

Alternatively, maybe C is a sulfate or some other salt. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps C is a chloride of a metal. For example, when C is AlCl3, but when AlCl3 is hydrolyzed, it forms Al(OH)3 and HCl. HCl is a strong acid (F), and Al(OH)3 is an amphoteric hydroxide. But then, Al(OH)3 isn't an acid, so that wouldn't fit G being an acid. Hmm.

Wait, another thought: Maybe C is a metal carbonate. If C reacts with water, it might not change much unless it's a carbonic acid situation. Wait, but carbonates react with water to form bicarbonates and hydroxides, which are bases, not acids.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a sulfite. Sulfites reacting with water could form sulfurous acid, which is a weak acid, but then what's the other product? Maybe the metal hydroxide again, which isn't an acid. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps C is a sulfate. For example, if C is CuSO4, reacting with water would just dissolve, but perhaps under certain conditions, but that's not producing acids.

Wait, maybe C is a nitride. Let's say C is NH3·H2O or something else. Hmm, not sure.

Alternatively, maybe C is a metal oxide that reacts with water to form a metal hydroxide (base) and oxygen. No, that doesn't help because we need two acids.

Wait, perhaps C is a metal bisulfide. For example, if C is H2S, but that's a gas, not a solid. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the second reaction: C + 2 D → E (dangerous). Maybe E is something like phosgene (COCl2), which is a dangerous gas. How would that form? Maybe C is CO and D is Cl2, but that doesn't fit the stoichiometry. Alternatively, perhaps C is something else.

Wait, another approach: Let's think about the possible compounds. Maybe A is Na2S, B is Cl2, so A reacts with 8 equivalents of Cl2? Not sure. Let me see: Na2S + Cl2 → NaCl + S. Wait, but that would require 2 equivalents of Cl2 per Na2S, perhaps? Or maybe more. Not sure.

Alternatively, maybe A is FeS and B is Cl2. Reacting FeS with Cl2 would give FeCl3 and S. But FeCl3 is yellowish, and S is yellow. Hmm, but the product C is bright red, so maybe not.

Wait, another angle: Let me think about product E. If E is extremely hazardous, perhaps it's a nerve agent, but I don't have enough info. Alternatively, maybe E is a highly toxic gas like sarin, but I'm not certain.

Wait, maybe E is something like diphosgene, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps E is HCN, but that's a weak acid. Hmm, not sure.

Wait, perhaps E is a compound like ClF3 or something else. Alternatively, maybe E is a highly reactive compound like O3 (ozone), but I don't think that's formed from C reacting with D.

Alternatively, let's think about the fourth reaction again. D reacts with B in a 1:1 ratio to form H, a solvent. If H is ethanol, then D and B would need to combine to form C2H5OH. But that would require B and D to be something like CO and H2, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, if H is water, then D and B could be H2 and O2, but that would require a catalyst and perhaps light for the reaction, but H2O is a product.

Wait, perhaps B is O2 and D is H2. So, they react in a 1:1 ratio (stoichiometric) to form H2O. That would fit, because 2H2 + O2 → 2H2O. But wait, that's a 2:1 ratio. Oh, in the problem statement, it's a 1:1 ratio. Hmm, that's a problem. So maybe the reaction is something else.

Wait, perhaps D is CO and B is H2. Then, in a 1:1 ratio, maybe they form something like CH3OH (methanol), which is a solvent. The reaction would be CO + 2 H2 → CH3OH. That's a 1:2 ratio, so for a 1:1, perhaps D is something else.

Alternatively, maybe B is Cl2 and D is CH4. Then, Cl2 + CH4 → CCl4 + HCl. But that's a 1:1 reaction, perhaps. But I'm not sure if that's a common reaction. Alternatively, maybe it's a substitution reaction where each molecule of CH4 reacts with one Cl2 to produce CCl4 and HCl. But I'm not certain about the stoichiometry.

Wait, maybe the reaction is D + B → H, which is a solvent. Another possibility is B being H2O and D being something else, but that doesn't fit because B is a gas. Wait, maybe B is Cl2 and D is NH3. Then, Cl2 + NH3 → NH2Cl, but that's not a solvent. Alternatively, they might form NH4Cl, but that's a solid, not a solvent.

Hmm, this is getting a bit stuck. Maybe I should think about E's structure and its symmetry. If I can figure out what E is, I can determine its molecular symmetry.

The options given are:

A) C2
B) D4h
C) D∞h
D) C2v

These are symmetry groups. D∞h is the symmetry of a linear molecule with an infinite number of symmetry operations, like CO2 (which is linear) but wait, CO2 has D∞h symmetry. Wait, no, CO2 is a linear molecule with D∞h symmetry. So if E is CO2, its symmetry group would be D∞h. But wait, CO2 is a gas, so maybe E is CO2. But wait, in the problem, E is produced by reacting C with D. If D is O2, then C would have to be something that reacts with O2 to form CO2. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe E is SO2, which is a bent molecule. The symmetry group for SO2 is D2h or something else. Wait, SO2 has a bent structure with a C2 axis and planes of symmetry. Its point group is D2h, I think. But the options don't include D2h; the closest is D4h (option B) or C2v (option D).

Wait, another thought: If E is phosgene (O=CCl2), which has a structure where the central carbon is double-bonded to O and has two Cl atoms. The molecule is planar and has a C2v symmetry. Because the molecule is linear in a way, but with two substituents on either side. Wait, no, phosgene is O=C(Cl)2, which is a trigonal planar molecule with a central C atom. The symmetry would be D3h, but that's not one of the options. Alternatively, maybe it's a C2v symmetry.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck on this. Let me recap what I have so far.

1. Reaction 1: A + 8 B → C (bright red)
2. Reaction 2: C + 2 D → E (dangerous)
3. Reaction 3: C + H2O → A + F (strong acid) + G (weak acid)
4. Reaction 4: D + B → H (solvent, 1:1 ratio)

If I can figure out what C is, that would help. Because C is reacting with H2O to form A and two acids. So if C is a sulfide, perhaps, but that didn't fit earlier.

Wait, another approach: Let's think about the third reaction. When C reacts with water, it produces A, a strong acid F, and a weak acid G. So if C is a sulfide, like FeS, then reacting with water would produce Fe(OH)2 (a strong base) and H2S (weak acid). But that gives a base and an acid, but the question says both F and G are acids. So that can't be it.

Wait, another possibility: Maybe C is a nitride, like NH3, but that's a gas, not a solid. Alternatively, perhaps C is a carbide, like CaC2. Reacting with water would produce C2H2 (acetylene) and Ca(OH)2, which is a base. Not helpful.

Wait, another thought: Maybe C is a chloride of a non-metal, like SOCl2. When SOCl2 reacts with water, it produces HCl (a strong acid) and H2SO4 (a strong acid). Wait, but that's two strong acids, but the question says F is strong and G is weak. So that doesn't fit.

Alternatively, maybe C is a thioamide or something else. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps C is a metal carbonate. For example, Na2CO3. Reacting with water doesn't change much unless it's an acidic solution. Alternatively, perhaps C is a sulfite, like Na2SO3. Reacting with water might not produce much, but if it's in an acidic solution, it could form H2SO3 (weak acid) and NaOH (strong base), which again doesn't fit because we need two acids.

Hmm. Maybe I'm approaching this wrong. Perhaps looking for a compound that, when hydrolyzed, gives two acids.

Wait, another idea: If C is a diacid anhydride, like maleic anhydride. When it reacts with water, it forms two carboxylic acids, but those are both strong or weak depending on the acid. But I'm not sure if that's the case here.

Alternatively, maybe C is a metal bisulfide, but I'm not certain.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the first reaction again. If A reacts with 8 equivalents of B to form C, which is bright red. 8 equivalents is a lot. Maybe it's a reaction where each molecule of A reacts with 8 molecules of B. What kind of reaction would that be?

Wait, perhaps A is a metal with a +2 charge, and B is a diatomic anion with -1 charge, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another thought: Maybe A is a metal, and B is a halogen, like Cl2. For example, Fe (A) reacting with Cl2 (B) to form FeCl3 (C). But FeCl3 is yellow, not bright red. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps A is a sulfide, and B is O2. So, A is FeS reacting with O2 to form Fe2O3 and SO2 or something like that. Not sure.

Wait, perhaps A is PbS (which is a dark brown solid) reacting with O2 to form PbO2 (dark brown) and SO2. But the product C is supposed to be bright red.

Hmm, I'm a bit stuck here. Maybe I should think about E's structure and possible symmetry groups.

The options are C2, D4h, D∞h, and C2v.

D∞h symmetry is typical for linear molecules with a center of inversion and multiple planes of symmetry. For example, CO2 has D∞h symmetry because it's linear with a central C=O bond and multiple symmetry planes.

So if E were CO2, its symmetry group would be D∞h, which is option C.

But wait, how would CO2 form? Let me see: If C is something that reacts with D to produce CO2. Like, if C is CO and D is O2, then 2CO + O2 → 2CO2. But in the problem, the reaction is C + 2 D → E. So that would fit if C is CO and D is O2, making E CO2.

But earlier, in reaction 4, D and B react in a 1:1 ratio to form H, a solvent. So if D is O2, what would B be? Because in reaction 4, D (O2) and B (some gas) react in 1:1 ratio to form a solvent. Hmm, maybe that's not possible.

Alternatively, maybe D is another gas. Let's say D is H2O vapor, but that's not a gas in all cases. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps E is Cl2O7 (dichlorine heptoxide), but I'm not sure about its symmetry.

Alternatively, perhaps E is something like O3 (ozone), which has a bent structure and a C2v symmetry group. Ozone is a toxic gas, which fits the description.

Wait, O3's structure is bent, with a central O atom double-bonded to two others. The molecule has a C2v symmetry because there's a two-fold rotation axis perpendicular to the molecular plane and a mirror plane. So its point group is C2v, which is option D.

But how would O3 form? Well, Ozone is formed by the reaction of O2 with UV light, but in this case, C reacts with 2 equivalents of D to form E. So if C is O2 and D is another O2, but that doesn't make sense. Hmm.

Wait, maybe C is O2 and D is something else. Not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps E is phosgene (O=CCl2), which has a structure where the central carbon is double-bonded to O and attached to two Cl atoms. The molecule is linear if you look at O=C-Cl2, but wait, no, the structure is trigonal planar. The symmetry group for phosgene is D3h, but that's not one of the options. Hmm.

Wait, another thought: Maybe E is a dimer of some sort. Or perhaps E is something like SO2, which is bent and has a C2v symmetry. SO2's point group is D2h, but that's not one of the options. Wait, no, D2h is a higher symmetry group than C2v.

Alternatively, maybe E is a molecule like H2O, but that's a solvent, not a product in this case.

Wait, going back. If E is CO2, which is linear, then its symmetry group is D∞h. So option C would be the right answer. How would CO2 form?

If C is CO and D is O2, then 2 CO + O2 → 2 CO2. But the reaction in the problem says C + 2 D → E. So that would fit if C is CO and D is O2. But earlier steps: C is formed from A + 8 B. Let me see:

A + 8 B → C (CO)
C + 2 D (O2) → E (CO2)

But then, how does C (CO) form from A and B? Let me think: Maybe A is carbon, and B is O2. Carbon (solid) reacting with O2 (gas) in a 8:1 ratio would form CO. But that's unlikely because carbon typically burns in O2 to form CO2, not CO, unless it's incomplete combustion.

But perhaps under certain conditions, like high temperatures with limited O2, carbon can form CO. So A is C (solid), B is O2 (gas), so 8 moles of O2 would react with 1 mole of C to produce 8 moles of CO. Wait, but the stoichiometry of CO formation from carbon and O2 is 2 C + O2 → 2 CO. So 1 mole of C would need 1 mole of O2 to produce 2 moles of CO. But in the problem, 8 equivalents of B (O2) are used per 1 equivalent of A (C). So 8 moles of O2 per 1 mole of C would actually produce 8 moles of CO, which would require 4 moles of C (from stoichiometry). Hmm, that doesn't fit. So maybe this line of thought isn't correct.

Alternatively, perhaps A is a metal oxide and B is a halogen. For example, if A is FeO and B is Cl2, but I'm not sure.

Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating things. Let's think about E as CO2 with D∞h symmetry. If that's the case, the answer would be option C. But I'm not entirely certain about the reactions leading to that.

Another thought: The third reaction is C + H2O → A + F + G. If C is CO2, then reacting with water would form H2CO3 (carbonic acid), which is a weak acid. But in that case, F and G would both be H2CO3, which isn't two different acids. So that doesn't fit.

Wait, maybe C is a chloride, like ClO2. But I'm not sure about its reactions.

Alternatively, perhaps E is ClF3, a highly reactive compound. ClF3 is a trigonal pyramidal molecule with C3v symmetry, but that's not one of the options.

Wait, another angle: If E is phosgene (O=CCl2), which is a highly toxic gas, perhaps the reaction is C (CO) + 2 D (Cl2) → COCl2. But I'm not sure about the stoichiometry.

Wait, CO + Cl2 → COCl2? That would require some condition, but I think more likely it's a step-wise substitution. Hmm, but I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a chlorinated compound, and D is something else.

This is getting a bit too tangled. Maybe I should try to make an educated guess based on the options. Among the options, D∞h (option C) is the symmetry of a linear molecule like CO2. If E is CO2, that would make sense, but I'm not entirely sure how it forms from the given reactions.

Alternatively, O3 has a C2v symmetry, which is option D. Ozone is a toxic gas, so it could fit as E being extremely hazardous. But would O3 form from C + 2 D? Hmm, perhaps if C is O2 and D is O, but O is not a common gas. Alternatively, some other reaction.

Alternatively, maybe E is SO2, which has a bent structure and C2v symmetry. But SO2 is a toxic gas, so that could fit. How would SO2 form? Perhaps C is S and D is O2. Then, S + 2 O2 → 2 SO2. But then, C would be S, which is a solid. Then, when C (S) reacts with water, it would form H2S (weak acid) and something else. Wait, S + H2O → H2S + something? No, S is a solid and doesn't react with water to form acids. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe C is SO3, which is a gas, but reacting with water forms H2SO4, a strong acid. But then C + H2O → H2SO4 (acid F) and something else. Not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps C is Na2SO3, which reacts with water to form H2SO3 (weak acid) and NaOH (strong base), but that doesn't fit because F and G are acids.

I'm getting stuck again. Since I'm running out of time, I think I'll go with the initial thought that E is CO2, which has D∞h symmetry. So the answer would be option C.


The problem involves a series of reactions leading to the formation of product E, and the goal is to determine its molecular symmetry group. The analysis proceeds as follows:

1. **Reaction 1**: Solid A reacts with 8 equivalents of gas B to form bright red product C. The bright red color suggests possible compounds like mercury(II) oxide (HgO) or transition metal oxides, but no definitive identification is made.

2. **Reaction 2**: C reacts with 2 equivalents of gas D to produce E, described as extremely hazardous. This suggests E could be a toxic gas like phosgene (COCl₂), ozone (O₃), or carbon dioxide (CO₂). However, the exact identity of E remains unclear.

3. **Reaction 3**: C reacts with water to form A, a strong acid F, and a weak acid G. This implies C must hydrolyze into two acids, but no specific compound fits this description perfectly.

4. **Reaction 4**: D reacts with B in a 1:1 ratio to form H, a solvent. This suggests H could be water (H₂O), but the exact identity of D and B is uncertain.

The molecular symmetry group of E is determined by its structure. Among the options:
- **C2**: A twofold rotation axis.
- **D4h**: A linear molecule with multiple symmetry planes and a center of inversion.
- **D∞h**: A linear molecule with an infinite number of symmetry operations, typical of CO₂.
- **C2v**: A bent molecule with a twofold rotation axis and a vertical mirror plane, typical of ozone (O₃).

Given the options and the reasoning, CO₂ is a plausible candidate for E, as it is linear and has **D∞h** symmetry. While other possibilities like ozone (C2v) or phosgene were considered, CO₂ aligns best with the description of E being extremely hazardous and fitting the symmetry group **D∞h**.

Answer: C
