Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let's see what the question is about. It's about two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds, and we need to find their relative speed and the total energy of the system. Hmm, sounds like it involves some special relativity concepts.

Alright, let's break this down. The problem states that two astronauts have masses 2m and 3m. Their speeds are 0.6c and 0.5c in the positive x-direction. The options given are A to D, each with different relative speeds and total energies.

First, I think I need to find the relative speed between the two astronauts. Wait, but wait—how do you find the relative speed in special relativity? Oh right, you can't just subtract the velocities like in classical mechanics. Because when objects are moving at speeds close to the speed of light, you have to use the relativistic velocity addition formula.

So the formula for relative velocity is (u - v)/(1 - (uv/c²)). Wait, but I need to make sure I get the signs right. Both are moving in the positive x-direction. Let's say astronaut A is moving at 0.6c and astronaut B at 0.5c. So from A's frame, what is B's speed?

Wait, no. Wait, the relative speed of B as seen from A's frame would be (v - u)/(1 - (u v)/(c²)). Wait, let me think: if A is moving at u relative to the lab, and B is moving at v relative to the lab, then the speed of B relative to A is (v - u)/(1 - (u v)/(c²)), right?

Wait, let me get that formula straight. Let me think about frames. Suppose in the lab frame, A is at velocity u and B at velocity v. Then, the velocity of B as seen from A's frame is (v - u)/(1 - (u v)/c²). Oh wait, wait, no—wait, if A is moving at u and B at v in the same direction, then from A's perspective, B is moving at (v - u)/(1 - (u v)/(c²)). Because when you switch frames, you're subtracting velocities relativistically.

Wait, but wait. Wait, in this case, both are moving in the same direction. So, the relative speed would be (v - u) over 1 minus (u v)/(c squared). So let's plug in the numbers.

u = 0.6c (Astronaut A's speed)
v = 0.5c (Astronaut B's speed)

So the numerator is (0.5c - 0.6c) = -0.1c. The denominator is 1 - (0.6c * 0.5c)/(c²) = 1 - (0.3 c²)/c² = 1 - 0.3 = 0.7. So the relative speed is (-0.1c) / 0.7 ≈ -0.1428c. But speed is a positive quantity, so the magnitude is about 0.1428c. So approximately 0.14c. Oh, wait, but looking at the options, option C and D have 0.14c as the relative speed. So that's one part done.

Now, the other part is the total energy of the system. Hmm, total energy in relativity includes both rest mass energy and kinetic energy, but wait, in relativity, each object's total energy is gamma times m c squared. So the total energy of the system is the sum of the energies of each astronaut.

So for each astronaut, calculate their gamma factor. Gamma is 1 / sqrt(1 - (v²/c²)).

Let's calculate for the first astronaut: mass 2m, speed 0.6c.

Gamma1 = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.6)^2 ) = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.36) = 1/sqrt(0.64) = 1/0.8 = 1.25.

So energy E1 = gamma1 * m_rest * c² = 1.25 * 2m * c² = 2.5 m c².

Wait, no, wait. Wait, the mass is 2m, so m_rest is 2m. So E1 = gamma * (2m) c². Hmm, right. So 1.25 * 2m c² = 2.5 m c².

Second astronaut: mass 3m, speed 0.5c.

Gamma2 = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.5)^2) = 1/sqrt(1 - 0.25) = 1/sqrt(0.75) ≈ 1/0.8660 ≈ 1.1547.

So E2 = 1.1547 * 3m c² = approx 3.4641 m c².

Adding E1 and E2: 2.5 + 3.4
