Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here. Let me try to work through it step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll give it a shot.

The problem says we have a state |alpha> which is proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>. So, the first thing I need to do is probably normalize this state. Because when a state is given as proportional, that means it's not necessarily normalized yet.

Wait, right. The state is a linear combination of |up> and |down>, which are eigenstates of the z-projection of the spin. So, I should compute the normalization factor. The normalization is done by taking the inner product of the state with itself. 

So, |alpha> is (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>, but it's proportional. So, the actual state would be (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>, multiplied by 1/sqrt(N), where N is the norm squared. Wait, no, let me correct that. The norm is the sum of the squares of the absolute values of each coefficient.

So, the coefficients are (1+i) and (2-i). The absolute squares are |1+i|² and |2−i|². Let's compute those.

|1+i|² = (1)^2 + (1)^2 = 2. Because the real part is 1, the imaginary part is 1. So 1^2 + 1^2 = 2.

|2−i|² = (2)^2 + (-1)^2 = 4 +1=5.

So the sum is 2 +5 =7. So the normalization factor is 1/sqrt(7). So the state is |alpha> = [ (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down> ] / sqrt(7).

Okay, that's the normalized state.

Now, the next part: we need to calculate the probability of measuring the particle in each of the eigenstates of another operator. The matrix representation of this operator is given by A_ij. A_ij is hbar/2 if i is different from j, and 0 otherwise. Hmm.

Wait, what does this matrix look like? Since it's a 2x2 matrix for spin-1/2 systems. So, the operator is represented as:

A = [[0, hbar/2], [
