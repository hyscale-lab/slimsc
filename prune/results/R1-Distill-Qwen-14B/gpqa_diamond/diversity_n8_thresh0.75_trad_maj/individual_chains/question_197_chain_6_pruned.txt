Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit stuck, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is.

The problem says that Compound X undergoes a reaction with red phosphorus and HI. I need to find out what the final product is. The options are A to D, all different organic compounds. The data given are the IR and NMR spectra of Compound X.

First, I remember that red phosphorus and HI are typically used in the Clemmensen reduction. Clemmensen reduces ketones to alkanes. So if Compound X has a ketone group, the reaction would reduce it to a methylene group (CH2) or a longer chain, depending on the starting material. Wait, but wait, Clemmensen is for ketones and aldehydes. So if it's a ketone, it will become a CH2 group. But wait, I think in Clemmensen, the carbonyl (C=O) becomes CH2. So if the starting compound is a ketone, the product would have a CH2 where the carbonyl was.

So, I need to figure out what Compound X is. Let's look at the spectral data.

The IR data shows peaks at 3400–2500 cm-1, which suggests O-H stretch, maybe from a carboxylic acid or an alcohol. But wait, I'm not sure. The 1720 cm-1 is a strong peak, which is often a carbonyl (C=O). The 1610 and 1450 cm-1 are around the range for aromatic C=C stretches. So maybe the compound has a carbonyl group, like an ester or a ketone, and an aromatic ring.

Looking at the 1H NMR data:

- 10.5 ppm (bs, 1H): A broad singlet around 10 ppm. That's a strong indication of an aldehyde proton, but wait, wait. Or wait, that could also be a carboxylic acid proton, but they usually are around 10-12 ppm. But wait, the integration is 1H. So, maybe it's an aldehyde. Because aldehydes are around 9-10 ppm, but sometimes higher. Alternatively, an acidic proton like a phenol or a carboxylic acid. But wait, in the IR, is there a peak that would suggest a carboxylic acid? Let me think. The IR has 3400–2500, which is a broad region, possibly O-H. But carboxylic acids have a broad O-H around 3000–2500. So if the NMR shows a peak at 10.5, that could be for a carboxylic acid. Because aldehyde protons are usually around 9-10, but sometimes higher. But a carboxylic acid proton is usually broad around 10-12. So in this case, 10.5 is possible. So maybe it's a carboxylic acid.

Wait, but then again, if the compound has an aldehyde group, that would also show around 10 ppm. But if the IR shows a peak around 1720 cm-1, which is a carbonyl. Aldehyde carbonyls are around 1720, aren't they? Or is that for ketones or esters? Wait, aldehydes typically have higher wavenumber for C=O, like around 1720 cm-1. Let me think: aldehyde C=O is around 1725-1700, ketone is around 1715 cm-1. Esters are around 1735-1710. So 1720 could be any of these. So perhaps the compound has a carbonyl group, which could be an aldehyde, ketone, ester, or acid. But the other IR peaks include aromatic rings.

Looking back at the NMR shifts: the 10.5 ppm peak is a single proton. If it's an aldehyde, that would make sense. Then, in the NMR, the aromatic region is at 8.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.2 ppm (d, 2H). That looks like a para-substituted aromatic ring. For example, in para-disubstituted benzene, the two protons adjacent to the substituents would be a doublet each, integrating to 2H each. So that suggests a para-substituted benzene with two substituents. Wait, but in the NMR, the areas add up to 4H
