Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem in front of me, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of these kinds of questions. But let's take it step by step.

The problem says a chemist performed two reactions with two unknown compounds, A and B, using different reducing agents. The products are both (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one and (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one, respectively. I need to figure out what A and B are from the given options.

First, I remember that LiBH4 and BH3 are both reducing agents, but they might have different specificities. Wait, LiBH4 is a strong reducing agent, right? It's commonly used to reduce carbonyl groups. But wait, what about BH3? I think BH3 is used for different types of reductions, like maybe in the formation of alcohols from ketones or aldehydes. Oh wait, no, maybe that's more for something like the hydroboration reaction. Hmm, maybe I'm mixing things up.

Wait, the products are tetrahydro pyran-2-one derivatives. So, tetrahydro pyran is a cyclic ether, a six-membered ring with an oxygen. The substituents are 4-ethyl and a ketone at position 2. So the structure is like a cyclic ether with a ketone group and an ethyl group in specific positions.

I think these products are the result of some kind of ring-forming reaction, perhaps via an acid-catalyzed mechanism. Oh wait, maybe they're formed from a hemiacetal or acetal? Or perhaps they come from a ketone undergoing some kind of cyclization.

Wait, looking at the reactions:

A is treated with LiBH4 and H+ to give (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one.

B is treated with BH3 and H+ to give (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one.

Hmm, so what's the role of the reducing agents here? Oh wait, maybe the starting materials are cyclic ketones or something else that can form rings upon reduction.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting materials are esters or something that can undergo reduction. Wait, another thought: reducing agents can also reduce esters. For example, LiBH4 can reduce esters to alcohols. But wait, if A and B are esters, then after reduction, they could form diols or
