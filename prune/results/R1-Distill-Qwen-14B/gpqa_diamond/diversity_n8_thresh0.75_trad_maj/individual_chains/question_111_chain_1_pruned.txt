Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem in front of me, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The problem has two parts, A and B, each involving a different reaction. I need to determine the major products for each and choose the correct option from the given choices (A, B, C, D).

First, looking at reaction A: 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one is reacting with ethyl acrylate under the presence of t-BuOK. The product is labeled A.

I remember that when a ketone reacts with an acrylate ester in the presence of a strong base like t-BuOK, it's likely an example of a conjugate addition or perhaps a Michael addition. Wait, but wait, Michael addition usually involves a nucleophile attacking an alpha, beta-unsaturated carbonyl. Alternatively, another possibility is an aldol addition, but I'm not sure.

Wait, the starting material is a cyclohexanone derivative. The structure is 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one. So the ketone is at position 1, and there are substituents at positions 2 and 6. Let me try to draw this mentally. Position 1 is the carbonyl, so the ring is cyclohexane with a ketone at C1. Then, at C2, there's an ethyl group and a methyl group? Wait, the formula is 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethyl. Oh, so at carbon 2, there's an ethyl and a methyl substituent. And at carbon 6, another methyl.

So the structure is a cyclohexane ring where the carbonyl is at C1. C2 has an ethyl and a methyl group, and C6 has a methyl. So the substituents are in positions 2 and 6.

When ethyl acrylate is present with a strong base like t-BuOK, which is a strong, bulky base, it probably deprotonates the alpha position to the carbonyl. But wait, ethyl acrylate is an enolate source. Or wait, maybe the cyclohexanone is getting deprotonated to form an enolate, which then reacts with the acrylate?

Wait, no. Wait, the reaction of a ketone with an acrylate might involve a conjugate addition. Alternatively, perhaps it's a nucleophilic attack. Let me think about the possible mechanisms.

Another thought: the base t-BuOK could deprotonate the alpha position
