Okay, so I've got this question about stars and iron atoms in their photospheres. Hmm, let me try to understand what's being asked here. So, the question is about the effective temperatures of two stars based on the excitation of iron atoms.

Alright, the setup is that iron atoms in star_1's photosphere are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to star_2. The energy difference between the levels is given as 1.38e-23 J. And we're assuming local thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE), which I remember means that the gas in each region of the star behaves as if it's in equilibrium with radiation, but maybe not the whole star.

Wait, so the key here is the excitation of energy levels. I think this relates to the Boltzmann equation. Oh right, the Boltzmann factor! The population of energy levels in a star's atmosphere can be described by the Boltzmann distribution. The ratio of populations of two energy levels is given by the Boltzmann factor, which depends on the temperature and the energy difference between the levels.

The Boltzmann equation says that the ratio of the number of atoms in two energy states is (g2/g1) * exp(-ΔE/(k*T)), where g's are the statistical weights (maybe assuming they're the same here?), ΔE is the energy difference, k is Boltzmann's constant, and T is the temperature.

Wait, the question says that the excitation is twice as high in star_1. So, maybe the population of the higher energy level in star_1 is twice that in star_2. Let's think: Let's denote the number of excited atoms in star_1 as N1, and in star_2 as N2. According to the problem, N1 = 2*N2.

But wait, wait. The question says the atoms in star_1 are twice as excited. So maybe the excitation is the relative population of a higher energy level compared to a lower one. So, the ratio N_upper/N_lower for star_1 is twice that of star_2. Because if the atoms are more excited, more are in higher energy levels.

So, the ratio would be N1/N2 = ( (g_upper/g_lower) * exp(-ΔE/(k T1)) ) / ( (g_upper/g_lower) * exp(-ΔE/(k T2)) ) ) = exp( ΔE/(k) (1/T2 - 1/T1) ) ?

Wait no, because N_upper/N_lower = (g_upper/g_lower) * exp
