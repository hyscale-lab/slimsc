Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this physics problem about the speed of light in a moving glass medium. Hmm, let's see. The question says that a light beam is moving through a glass with index of refraction n. The glass itself is moving at a constant velocity v in the same direction as the beam and towards the observer in the lab. I need to find the speed of the light relative to the observer.

Wait, I remember that the speed of light in a medium is generally c/n, where c is the speed of light in a vacuum. But wait, that's when the medium is stationary relative to the observer. What happens when the medium is moving?

I think this has to do with the addition of velocities, like in special relativity. Oh right, the velocity addition formulas. But wait, relativity might complicate things because when you have moving media, the refractive index and the speed of light can change. But I'm not sure about that.

Wait, the problem states that the speed of light in vacuum is c=1. So in this case, in the glass, the usual speed would be 1/n. But when the glass is moving, how does that affect it?

Wait, no. Because in the glass's rest frame, the light is moving at speed v_light = 1/n. But from the lab frame, which is moving relative to the glass, I need to find the observed speed of light.

Hmm, since the glass is moving towards the observer, but in the same direction as the light beam. Wait, same direction as the beam? So the glass is moving towards the observer, but the light beam inside is moving towards the observer as well.

Wait, the glass is moving at velocity v in the same direction as the beam. So from the lab frame, the glass is moving, which affects how we perceive the light's speed.

Wait, maybe I should think about this using the velocity transformation from the glass's frame to the lab frame.

In the glass's frame (let's call it frame S'), the light is moving at velocity u' = c/n, which is 1/n because c=1. The glass is moving at velocity v in the lab frame S. So I need to apply the velocity addition formula to find the speed of light in the lab frame.

The velocity addition formula in special relativity is u = (u' + v) / (1 + (u' * v)/c²). But here, c is 1, so it becomes u = (u' + v) / (1 + u' v).

Wait, but u' is the speed of light in the glass, which is 1/n. So substituting, u = ( (1/n) + v ) / (1 + (1/n) v ) .

Let me compute that. So numerator is (1 + n v)/n, and denominator is (n + v)/n. So the n's cancel out, leaving (1 + n v)/(n + v). So u = (1 + n v)/(n + v).

Looking at the options, option A is (1 + n v)/(n +v), which matches.

Wait, but another thought: is this scenario applicable in classical mechanics? Because sometimes in these problems, you can get away with Galilean addition. But when velocities are a significant fraction of c, you need to use the relativistic formula. But the problem doesn't specify, so perhaps we're supposed to use the relativistic approach.

Alternatively, if the glass is moving at v, the light's speed in the glass's frame is 1/n. So in the lab frame, it would be 1/n + v, but only if velocities are small compared to c. But that would be the classical approach, which would give (1/n + v). But none of the options match that exactly. Wait, looking at the options again:

Option A is (1 + n v)/(n + v) → Expand it, (1 + nv) over (n + v). Alternatively, in the small v limit (v << 1), we can approximate. If v is small, then the denominator n +v ≈ n, and the numerator 1 + n v ≈ 1. So u ≈ (1)/(n). Which is correct in the low velocity limit. So this seems to match the relativistic approach.

But wait, what if the glass is moving in the same direction as the light beam. So in the glass's frame, the light is moving at 1/n towards the observer. In the lab frame, the glass is moving towards the observer. So the light in the lab frame is moving at (1/n + v)/(1 + (v)(1/n)).

Wait, that's a bit confusing. Maybe better to think about it. Let me see.

In the glass's rest frame, the light is moving towards the observer at speed u' = 1/n. The glass is moving at velocity v in the lab frame. So to get the lab frame speed u, you use the relativistic velocity addition formula.

Yes, that's correct. Because the observer is in the lab, and the glass is moving towards the observer. So the light's velocity in the lab would be the sum of the glass's velocity and the light's velocity in the glass's frame, but adjusted for relativity.

So according to the formula, u = (u' + v) / (1 + (u' v)/c²). Since c=1, u = (u' + v)/(1 + u' v).

As u' is 1/n, substituting:

u = (1/n + v) / (1 + (1/n) v) = [ (1 + n v) / n ] / [ (n + v)/n ] = (1 + n v)/(n + v). 

So the answer should be option A.

But wait, the options are:

A) (1 + n v)/(n + v)
B) 1
C) (1 +n v)/(n -v)
D) (1 -n v)/(n +v)

So A matches. So the correct answer is A.


To determine the speed of light in the glass relative to the observer in the laboratory, we use the relativistic velocity addition formula. In the glass's rest frame, the speed of light is \( u' = \frac{1}{n} \), where \( n \) is the refractive index of the glass. The glass itself is moving at a constant velocity \( v \) in the same direction as the light beam, towards the observer.

The relativistic velocity addition formula is:

\[
u = \frac{u' + v}{1 + \frac{u' v}{c^2}}
\]

Since \( c = 1 \), this simplifies to:

\[
u = \frac{u' + v}{1 + u' v}
\]

Substituting \( u' = \frac{1}{n} \), we get:

\[
u = \frac{\frac{1}{n} + v}{1 + \frac{v}{n}}
\]

Simplify the numerator and denominator:

\[
u = \frac{\frac{1 + n v}{n}}{\frac{n + v}{n}}
\]

The \( n \) terms cancel out, leaving:

\[
u = \frac{1 + n v}{n + v}
\]

This matches option A. The other options do not align with the relativistic velocity addition formula or the given conditions. Therefore, the speed of light in the glass relative to the observer in the laboratory is:

\[
\frac{1 + n v}{n + v}
\]

Answer: A
