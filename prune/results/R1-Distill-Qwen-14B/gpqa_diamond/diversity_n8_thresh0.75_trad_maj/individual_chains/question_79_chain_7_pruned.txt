Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this organic chemistry problem. The question is about identifying a compound X based on its reaction product's NMR spectra. Hmm, let me start by breaking down the problem.

Alright, so the reaction involves compound X reacting with 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane in a nonpolar solvent at 403 K for a day. I recall that 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane is a strong, bulky base, often used in elimination reactions. So, maybe compound X is undergoing an elimination to form a double bond or something. Wait, or could it be a ring-opening or some kind of rearrangement?

The product's NMR data is given, both 1H and 13C. So I need to figure out what the product looks like and then backtrack to find what X was.

Looking at the 1H NMR first. The signals are:
- 2.28 (3H, s)
- 2.31 (3H, s)
- 6.75 (1H, d)
- 7.08 (2H, d)
- 7.68 (1H, d)
- 7.71 (2H, d)

So, the singlet at 2.28 and 2.31 ppm, each 3H, suggests two methyl groups attached to something that doesn't split their signals. Maybe two different methyl groups attached to a carbon with no adjacent protons. Like maybe in an epoxide ring?

Wait, looking at the options, all of them have some sort of oxirane (epoxide) ring. The options are A) 2-(4-methylstyryl)oxirane, B) 2-(1-phenylprop-1-en-2-yl)oxirane, C) 2-methyl-3-styryloxirane, D) 2-styrylepoxide.

Wait, but the product's NMR is after reaction, so the product is likely something else. Oh wait, the reaction is with a base, so perhaps it's an elimination. Could X be a diol or something that can undergo elimination to form a double bond?

Wait, but all the options are epoxides. Hmm. Wait, maybe the reaction is a ring-opening of the epoxide? Wait, but 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane is a base, not an acid. Epoxides can ring-open under basic conditions. So perhaps X is an epoxide, and upon treatment with a base, it undergoes ring-opening.

Wait, but then what would the product be? Ring-opening of an epoxide with a base typically leads to an elimination, forming a double bond. Alternatively, maybe a carbocation rearrangement if the base abstracts a proton and the epoxide oxygen acts as a leaving group.

Wait, but the product's NMR shows aromatic protons. Let me look at the 1H NMR. Let's see: the aromatic region has two doublets, one at 6.75 (1H, d) and 7.08 (2H, d), and another at 7.68 (1H, d) and 7.71 (2H, d). So that seems like
