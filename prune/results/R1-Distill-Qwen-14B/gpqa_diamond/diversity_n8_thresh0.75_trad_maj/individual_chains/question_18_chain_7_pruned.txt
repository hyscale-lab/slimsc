Okay, so I've got this question about stellar abundances and figuring out the ratio of silicon atoms in two stars. Hmm, let me try to break it down step by step. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll think through it.

First, the question gives me two stars, Star_1 and Star_2, with masses 1.5 and 1.2 times that of the Sun. But I don't think the mass matters for the elemental abundance calculation, so I'll set that aside for now.

The elemental abundances given are using logarithmic scales, which are common in astronomy. The [X/Y] notation represents the logarithm of the ratio of X to Y relative to the Sun. So, [X/Y] = log10(n_X/n_Y) - log10(n_X/n_Y)_sun. Or wait, no, I think it's [X/Y] = log10(n_X/n_Y / (n_X/n_Y)_sun). So, it's log10 of (X/Y ratio in star divided by X/Y ratio in Sun).

Let me parse the given data:

For Star_1:
- [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 dex. So, the ratio of Si to Fe in Star_1 is 10^0.3 times that of the Sun.
- [Fe/H]_1 = 0 dex. So, [Fe/H] is the logarithm of (Fe/H ratio in Star_1 divided by Sun's Fe/H). If it's 0, that means Fe/H in Star_1 is the same as in the Sun.

For Star_2:
- [Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3 dex. So, Mg/Si ratio is 10^0.3 times that of the Sun.
- [Mg/H]_2 = 0 dex. So, Mg/H ratio in Star_2 is the same as in the Sun.

Wait, but then the question is about the ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2. So, I need to find (n_Si,1) / (n_Si,2).

But to find that, I need to relate the Si abundance in each star to the Sun's.

Let me outline what I know:

In the Sun:
- n_Fe / n_H = 10^(-7.5 - 12) ? Wait, no. Wait, the Sun's photospheric composition is given as 12 + log10(n_Fe/n_H) = 7.5. So, log10(n_Fe/n_H)_sun = 7.5 - 12 = -4.5. So, n_Fe/n_H = 10^(-4.5).

Similarly, for Mg: 12 + log10(n_Mg/n_H) =7. So log10(n_Mg/n_H)_sun = 7 -12 = -5. So n_Mg/n_H = 10^(-5).

Wait, wait. Let me make this clearer.

For the Sun:

log10(n_Fe/n_H) = (7.5 - 12) = -4.5. So n_Fe/n_H_sun = 10^(-4.5).

Similarly, log10(n_Mg/n
