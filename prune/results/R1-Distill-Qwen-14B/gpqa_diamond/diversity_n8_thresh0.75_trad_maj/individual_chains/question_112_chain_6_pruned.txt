Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Let me try to break it down step by step. Hmm, the question is about finding probabilities and the average value of an operator. Alright, let's see.

The state is given as |alpha> proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2 - i)|down>. Wait, so that means |alpha> is a linear combination of the spin-up and spin-down states. I remember that the probabilities are the square of the magnitudes of the coefficients, right?

First, I need to normalize the state. Because the coefficients aren't necessarily normalized. So the state is (1+i)|up> + (2 - i)|down>. The normalization factor would be the square root of the sum of the squares of the magnitudes of each coefficient.

Let me calculate the coefficients' magnitudes. The first coefficient is (1+i). The magnitude is sqrt(1^2 + 1^2) = sqrt(2). The second coefficient is (2 - i). The magnitude is sqrt(2^2 + (-1)^2) = sqrt(4 + 1) = sqrt(5). So the squared magnitudes are 2 and 5, respectively. Adding them gives 2 +5 =7. So the normalization factor is 1/sqrt(7). So the state |alpha> is [ (1+i)/sqrt(7) ] |up> + [ (2 -i)/sqrt(7) ] |down>.

Now, the problem is about another operator whose matrix is given. The matrix A has elements A_ij = hbar/2 if i≠j, and 0 otherwise. Wait, so in a 2x2 matrix, the diagonal elements are zero, and the off-diagonal elements are hbar/2. So the matrix would look like this:

[ 0     hbar/2 ]
[ hbar/2  0 ]

Wait, that's a 2x2 matrix. So what operator has this form? Oh, wait, that looks like the Pauli X operator multiplied by hbar/2. Because the Pauli X matrix is [[0,1],[1,0]], so if you multiply that by hbar/2, you get exactly this matrix A.

So the operator is (hbar/2) sigma_x, where sigma_x is the Pauli X matrix. And sigma_x has eigenstates |+x> and |-x>, which are the eigenstates for the x-component of spin.

But wait, the problem is asking for the probability of measuring the particle in each eigenstate of operator A. So the eigenstates are |+x> and |-x>. So I need to express |alpha> in terms of these eigenstates and find the probabilities.

Alternatively, another approach: The operator A is (hbar/2) sigma_x. So its eigenvalues are ±hbar/2. The eigenstates are the same as sigma_x, which are the superpositions |+x> = (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2), and |-x> = (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2).

Wait, no, wait. Let me get that right. The eigenstates of sigma_x are |+x> = (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2) and |-x> = (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2). Because sigma_x |+x> = +|+x>, and similarly for |-x>.

So to find the probability of measuring the eigenvalues ±hbar/2, I need to find the projection of |alpha> onto each of these eigenstates.

Alternatively, perhaps I can just compute the expectation value
