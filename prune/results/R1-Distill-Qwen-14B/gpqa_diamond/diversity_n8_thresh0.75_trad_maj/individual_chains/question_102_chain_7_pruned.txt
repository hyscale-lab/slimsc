Okay, so I'm trying to solve this multiple-choice science question. Let me read through it carefully and try to understand what's going on. 

The question is about a ligand-receptor pair expressed in neural crest cells, and we're looking into their developmental fate. They've created a bicistronic lox-Cre vector, which I think means it can express two proteins from a single vector, probably using internal ribosome entry sites (IRES) or something similar. 

So the setup is that the ligand ORF is at the 5' position, fused to mCherry, and the receptor is at the 3' position with eGFP at the C-terminus. The ligand is under the CBA promoter, which I remember is a strong promoter, perhaps a cytomegalovirus (CMV) promoter or similar. Upstream of the receptor is the IRES element. 

Wait, bicistronic vectors often have two separate coding regions, each with their own promoters or using an IRES for internal ribosome entry. In this case, it seems the ligand is under the CBA promoter, and the receptor is under the control of an IRES element after the ligand. 

Then there are loxP and lox2272 cassettes with stop signals. The ligand part has a stop in a loxP cassette, and the receptor has a stop in a lox2272 cassette. I think that the presence of Cre recombinase would remove these stop cassettes. So, when Cre is present, the loxP sites would be recognized, and the stop would be excised. 

The antibodies were raised against the overexpressed proteins, and they're testing expression via Western blot. The blot shows a signal proportional to actin, meaning the loading is correct. So, the actin loading control works, which suggests that the proteins are being denatured and run properly.

They then breed a mouse model that's homozygous for the construct in a wild-type background. Then, they cross these mice with SOX10-Cre hemizygous mice. SOX10 is a transcription factor important in neural crest development, so the Cre might be expressed in neural crest derivatives like astrocytes. 

After the offspring are born, they're visualized under a confocal microscope. They're looking for green signals, which probably correspond to the eGFP on the receptor. But they don't see any green. So why isn't the eGFP showing up?

Let me think about the possible options.

Option A: ligand and receptor are in a paracrine relationship. Paracrine means they act on nearby cells. But the question is about the expression construct, so maybe this doesn't directly explain the lack of eGFP. They're looking for eGFP expression, so perhaps this isn't the issue.

Option B: the receptor-eGFP construct is stuck in the Golgi. If the receptor wasn't properly trafficked, perhaps it wouldn't reach the cell surface and thus wouldn't fluoresce. But in the Western blot, they might detect the protein even if it's stuck. The question says the blot uses total proteins, so if the protein is made, it should show up. But without knowing if the antibodies are specific, maybe? Although the question says they used antibodies against the overexpressed proteins, so presumably specific.

Option C: the enhancer for the ligand and receptor expression is missing. So, if the promoter isn't active, the proteins wouldn't be expressed. But the ligand is under the CBA promoter, which is strong. Unless the construct lacks necessary regulatory elements, like tissue-specific enhancers. But the mice are crossed with SOX10-Cre, which is likely to drive Cre in neural crest-derived cells, perhaps in astrocytes. Maybe the promoter is not active in those cells, but the CBA promoter is constitutive. So if the promoter is okay, the enhancer might not be an issue. Or perhaps the CBA promoter is not active in the cells being examined. Wait, but the ligand is under CBA, and the receptor is under IRES. So for the receptor, the IRES would drive expression from the same transcript as the ligand. Hmm.

Option D: the receptor and the eGFP are not in the frame. This would cause a frameshift, leading to a nonfunctional protein or no eGFP. So if the stop codon is in the wrong frame, the eGFP wouldn't be expressed correctly. So the eGFP wouldn't fluoresce because the construct isn't properly in frame, so the protein isn't made. But wait, how does the lox system affect this?

Wait, the vector is a bicistronic lox-Cre vector. The ligand ORF is fused to mCherry, and there's a loxP-stop-loxP cassette in between. The receptor is after the IRES, with a lox2272-stop-lox2272 cassette upstream. So when Cre is present, the loxP sites are cut, and the stop is removed. So ligand and mCherry would be co-expressed, and the same for receptor and eGFP.

Wait, but in the absence of Cre, the ligand would be expressed (since under CBA promoter) but the stop would prevent mCherry from being expressed. But in the presence of Cre (like in the offspring), the stop cassettes would be removed, so ligand and mCherry are expressed, receptor and eGFP are expressed.

Wait, but the mouse is homozygous for the construct. Then they crossed with SOX10-Cre. So the offspring would have the construct and Cre. So the Cre would excise the loxP and lox2272 cassettes, allowing both ligand/mCherry
