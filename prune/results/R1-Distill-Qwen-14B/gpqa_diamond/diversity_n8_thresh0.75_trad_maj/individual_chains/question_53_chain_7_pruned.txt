Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question says.

The compound is a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring, so it's an aromatic compound with two substituents on a benzene ring. The FTIR shows ester groups, which means there's an ester functional group present. Ester groups have a carbonyl (C=O) and an ether-like linkage (O). The IR would show strong absorption around 1700 cm^-1 for the carbonyl.

Looking at the 1H NMR spectrum, there are six signals. Let's break them down:

1. Two signals for aromatic protons. So, the aromatic ring has two sets of protons. Since it's di-substituted, the substituents could be in positions that cause different environments for the aromatic protons. For example, para substitution would give two sets of protons if the substituents are different. Wait, no, wait. Wait, no, for di-substituted benzene, the possible substitution patterns are ortho, meta, or para. Since the aromatic protons are two signals, that suggests that the substituents are such that the ring has two types of aromatic protons. For instance, if the substituents are in para positions, but if the substituents are identical, then the ring would have two sets: the para protons would be equivalent, but wait, no. Wait, if two substituents are attached at para positions, the ring would have two sets of equivalent protons. Alternatively, if the substituents are meta, but I'm a bit fuzzy on that. Alternatively, maybe the substituents are in a position where the ring protons are split into two different environments.

Wait, maybe it's better to think about the structure that would give two aromatic signals. For example, a di-substituted benzene where the substituents are in such a way that the ring protons are in two different environments. Let's say substituents are in the para positions but are different groups. Then the ring would have protons in two sets: two equivalent protons on each adjacent position, but wait, in para substitution, the substituents are opposite each other. So the aromatic protons would be at ortho, meta, and para positions relative to each substituent. Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating this.

Alternatively, maybe the substit
