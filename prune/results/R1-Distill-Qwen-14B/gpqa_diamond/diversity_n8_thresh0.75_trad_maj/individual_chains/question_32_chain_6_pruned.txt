Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, so I'll try to think it through step by step. Let's see, the question is about finding the energy of the RHIC when a certain nucleus is moving at 0.96c. The nucleus is Li with 3 neutrons, which I think means it's Li-6, right? Because Li normally has 3 protons, and 3 neutrons makes it Li-6. So the mass number A is 6.

The problem is asking for the energy of the collider such that the speed of the nucleus X is 0.96 times the speed of light. I remember that in particle physics, the energy of a moving particle is given by the relativistic energy formula. But wait, which formula exactly? Hmm.

I think for a particle moving at relativistic speeds, the total energy is gamma times the rest mass energy. Gamma is the Lorentz factor, which is 1 over sqrt(1 - v²/c²). Yeah, that's right. So the formula would be E = gamma * m * c². But wait, what are the units here? The options are in GeV, and I think the rest mass energy of a nucleus is in MeV or something similar. Oh right, because protons and neutrons are each about 938 MeV/c². So for Li-6, which has 6 nucleons, the rest mass energy should be 6 times that, around 5628 MeV or 5.628 GeV.

Wait, but I need to be precise. Let me think: each nucleon (proton or neutron) has a rest mass of approximately 938.272 MeV/c². So for Li-6, with 3 protons and 3 neutrons, the total rest mass m is 6 * 938.272 MeV/c². Let me calculate that: 6 * 938.272 = 5629.632 MeV, which is 5.629632 GeV. Okay.

So m = 5.629632 GeV/c². Now, the speed v is 0.96c. So I need to calculate gamma. Gamma is 1 / sqrt(1 - (v²/c²)). Plugging in v=0.96c, v²/c² is (0.96)^2 = 0.92
