Okay, so I've got this pretty complex question here about molecular biology and genetic constructs. It's a bit dense, but I'll try to break it down. Let's see what the question is about.

The scenario is that someone has discovered a new ligand-receptor pair expressed in neural crest cells. They're trying to study their developmental role. So, they've created a bicistronic lox-Cre vector. I remember that bicistronic means it has two coding regions, so in this case, the ligand and receptor are each on this vector.

Looking at the setup: the ligand's ORF is at 5', fused to mCherry, and the receptor is at 3' with eGFP at the C-terminus. The ligand is under the CBA promoter, and the receptor has an IRES upstream. There are stop cassettes with loxP and lox2272 between them. They also made antibodies against the overexpressed proteins and tested the construct expression via Western blot.

After that, they made a mouse model homozygous for the construct in a wild-type background. Then, they crossed these mice to SOX10-Cre hemizygous mice. They look for green signal under confocal, but don't see any. The question is why.

The options are A to D. Let's think about each.

First, the construct: bicistronic means both ligand and receptor are expressed. The ligand is under CBA promoter, which I think is a strong promoter, maybe constitutive. The receptor is under an IRES, which typically allows for internal ribosome entry, so the receptor might be expressed after the ligand.

The stop cassettes: the ligand has a loxP-stop-loxP cassette between its ORF and mCherry. Similarly, the receptor has a lox2272-stop-lox2272 between its ORF and eGFP. So, without the Cre recombinase, the stop cassette blocks expression beyond the stop site. But when Cre is present, it recombines and removes the stop, allowing expression.

Wait, but the vector is a bicistronic vector, meaning both ligand and receptor are on the same transcript? Or are they separate? No, bicistronic usually means two genes in one transcript, separated by an IRES. So, the first gene is ligand, then the IRES, then the receptor. So when the vector is transcribed, the transcript has ligand and receptor, but the IRES allows the ribosome to translate the second ORF after the first.

But in this case, each has a stop cassette. So the ligand is under CBA, then it has a stop with loxP. The receptor has an IRES, then its own ORF, then a stop with lox2272. Then, each is tagged with mCherry and eGFP.

Wait, actually, the ligand's ORF is 5' with mCherry fused, but the stop is between them. So normally, without Cre, the ligand is expressed, but the mCherry is blocked. Same for the receptor: receptor is expressed, but the eGFP is blocked.

But when Cre is introduced, which is done via the SOX10-Cre mice, which I believe are mice that express Cre under the control of SOX10, a gene active in neural crest cells. So, when these mice are crossed with the homozygous construct mice (which have the loxP and lox2272 sites), the Cre would recombine the lox sites, removing the stop cassettes.

So, the ligand and mCherry should be co-expressed, and the receptor and eGFP should be co-expressed, but only in cells that have Cre activity.

Wait, but the question says that after the offspring is born, they're visualized under confocal. But they donâ€™t see a green signal. The green signal would be from eGFP, which is attached to the receptor.

So why is there no green? The options are about possible reasons.

Option A:
