Okay, so I'm looking at this organic chemistry problem, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me try to unpack what's going on here.

First, the problem starts with Compound A, which has a proton NMR spectrum with two signals. One is a triplet at 0.9 ppm for 6H, and the other is a quartet at 1.3 ppm for 4H. Hmm, I remember that in NMR, the splitting tells us about neighboring protons. A triplet means each proton is split into two by two neighboring protons, right? So the triplet at 0.9 ppm probably indicates a methyl group (CH3) attached to a CH2. Because if you have a CH2 next to another CH2, like in ethyl groups, the splitting would be a quartet for the adjacent CH2. Wait, no, wait. Let me think again.

Wait, the triplet at 0.9 for 6H. That's a lot of hydrogen. Six hydrogens in a triplet—so maybe it's two equivalent CH3 groups, each with three H. The triplet suggests each of these CH3 is next to a CH2 with two H. Because when a CH3 is next to a CH2, the splitting would be a quartet for the CH2 and a triplet for the CH3. Because the CH3 is split by the two H on the adjacent CH2, so n+1 gives 3 peaks (triplet). 

So, the triplet of 6H could be two CH3 groups, each attached to a CH2. Because 2 CH3 would have 6 H in total. And the quartet at 1.3 ppm for 4H—quartet implies that each of those H is split by a CH2 with three neighboring H, right? Wait, no. Quartet is n+1 where n=3, so the neighboring group has three H. Wait, that's not right. Wait, the number of neighboring H determines the splitting. So a quartet comes from n=3 H on the adjacent group. So that would be a CH2 next to a CH with three H, but that doesn't make much sense. Alternatively, maybe it's a CH2 attached to another CH2, which would make each CH2 a quartet. Because each H in the middle CH2 would be next to two H on each side, so 2+1=3? Wait, no, that might not be right. Wait, the neighboring group's H determines the splitting. 

Wait, maybe I should think about ethyl groups. A triplet in NMR for the CH3 and a
