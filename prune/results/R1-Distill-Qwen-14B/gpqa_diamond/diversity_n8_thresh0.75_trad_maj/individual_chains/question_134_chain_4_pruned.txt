Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit stuck, but let's try to work through it step by step. 

The question is about calculating the enthalpy of neutralization when mixing HCl, H2SO4, and Ba(OH)2. Hmm, I remember that neutralization reactions involve acids and bases reacting to form water. The enthalpy of neutralization usually refers to the heat released when an acid reacts with a base. 

Wait, but wait, the problem gives me three solutions: HCl, H2SO4, and Ba(OH)2. I'm a bit confused because I thought neutralization is between an acid and a base. So here, HCl and H2SO4 are acids, and Ba(OH)2 is a base. Oh right, so maybe they're all reacting together. But I need to figure out how they interact.

First, I should probably write down the chemical equations for each reaction. Let's see.

HCl is a strong acid, so it will dissociate completely. H2SO4 is a strong acid too, but wait, it's a diprotic acid. So, it can donate two H+ ions. Ba(OH)2 is a strong base. It dissociates into Ba^2+ and OH^- ions. Each Ba(OH)2 gives two OH^- per formula unit. So, each mole of Ba(OH)2 gives two moles of OH^-.

So when these are mixed, the H+ from the acids will react with the OH^- from the base. The neutralization reaction is H+ + OH^- → H2O, which releases heat. The enthalpy change for this is usually around -57 kJ/mol per mole of H+ (if I remember correctly, typical values are about -57 kJ/mol for strong acids and strong bases).

But wait, wait. The problem is asking about the total enthalpy when these three solutions are mixed. So I need to find out how many moles of H+ and OH- are present, then find the limiting reagent, and calculate based on that.

Let me first calculate the moles of each acid and base.

HCl: volume is 500 mL, which is 0.5 L. Molarity is 0.2 M. Moles = Molarity × Volume = 0.2 * 0.5 = 0.1 moles. Since HCl is a strong acid, each mole gives 1 mole H+. So moles H+ from HCl = 0.1.

H2SO4: volume is 300 mL → 0.3 L. Molarity 0.3 M. Moles H2SO4 = 0.3 * 0.3 = 0.09 moles. Each H2SO4 gives 2 H+ ions, so total H+ from H2SO4 = 0.09 * 2 = 0.18 moles.

Ba(OH)2: volume 200 mL → 0.2 L. Molarity 0.5 M. Moles Ba(OH)2 = 0.5 * 0.2 = 0.1 moles. Each Ba(OH)2 gives 2 OH- per formula unit, so moles OH- = 0.1 * 2 = 0.2 moles.

Wait, but wait. When the solutions are mixed, all the H+ and OH- will be in the same solution
