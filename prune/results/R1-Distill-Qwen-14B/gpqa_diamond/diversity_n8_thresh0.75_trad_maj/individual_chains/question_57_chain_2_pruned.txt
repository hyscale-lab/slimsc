Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about electron scattering, and I need to find the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude along the incident beam direction. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's think it through.

The question gives me phase shifts for different angular momentum states. The phase shifts are δ₀ = 90°, δ₁ = 67°, δ₂ =55°, δ₃=30°, and δ₄=13°. The rest are ignored, so I guess I only consider these five.

Wait, what's the formula for the scattering amplitude? Oh right, in partial wave analysis, the scattering amplitude f(θ) is a sum over all the partial waves. Each term is related to the phase shift δₗ. The general expression is something like:

f(θ) = (1/k) Σ [ ( (2l + 1) / (2l + 1)! ) * (i^l) * (sin(θ/2))^l * (sin δₗ) ) ]

Wait, no, maybe I'm mixing it up. Oh wait, wait. The scattering amplitude in the Born approximation, or more generally, considering each partial wave, is given by:

f(θ) = sum_{l=0}^∞ ( (2l + 1) / (2l + 1)! ) * ( (i)^l ) * ( (sin(θ/2))^l ) * ( e^{i δₗ} - 1 ) )

But wait, I think I'm getting the exact formula wrong. Let me think again. Oh right, the amplitude f is calculated as a sum over all l of ( (2l+1) ) * ( (e^{i δₗ} -1) ) * ( ( (sin(θ/2) )^l ) / ( (2π)^{1/2} * (2l+1)! ) ) ) ) multiplied by the appropriate factors.

Wait, no, perhaps the correct formula is f(θ) = (1/k) * sum_{l=0}^∞ [ ( (2l + 1) ) * ( (sin (θ/2))^l ) / ( (2π)^{1/2} ) ) ] * [ e^{i δₗ} - 1 ] / ( l! ) )

But I'm not entirely sure about the exact factors here. Alternatively, I remember that the imaginary part of the forward scattering amplitude (θ=0) is given by the sum of the s
