Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the final product when Compound X reacts with red phosphorus and HI. Let me go through this step by step.

First, I'll look at the given data. The compound has IR and NMR spectra. Let me jot down the key points.

IR Data:
- 3400â€“2500 cm-1: This broad region might indicate O-H stretches, like from a carboxylic acid or an alcohol, or maybe an amine. But since the options have benzoic acids and such, maybe it's a carboxylic acid.
- 1720 cm-1: That's a strong carbonyl (C=O) stretch. So probably a ketone, aldehyde, or carboxylic acid.
- 1610 and 1450 cm-1: These are around the range for aromatic C=C stretching. So the compound likely has an aromatic ring.

1H NMR Data:
- 10.5 ppm (bs, 1H): A broad singlet around 10.5. That could be an aldehyde proton, but aldehyde protons are usually around 9-10. Alternatively, a carboxylic acid proton might be around 10-12, but it's usually a broad peak. Wait, but the integration is 1H, so maybe it's an aldehyde? Or perhaps an acidic proton like in a carboxylic acid. Hmm.

Looking at the other peaks:
- 8.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.2 ppm (d, 2H): These are typical for an aromatic ring with two substituents in the para positions. The downfield at 8.0 suggests maybe electron-withdrawing groups, like a carbonyl. So, maybe para-substituted benzene with a substituent that has a carbonyl group.

Other NMR signals:
- 2.9 ppm (m, 1H): A multiplet, maybe near a CH group connected to an oxygen or another CH. Could be adjacent to a carbonyl.
- 1.7 ppm (m, 2H): Another multiplet, perhaps some CH2 groups next to a branching point or a carbonyl.
- 1.4 ppm (d, 3H): A doublet, maybe a CH(CH3)2 group or something with a geminal substituent. Or perhaps a carbonyl next to a CH2 group.
- 0.9 ppm (t, 3H): A triplet, likely a terminal CH3 group, like from an ethyl chain.

Putting this together, maybe the compound has a benzene ring with a substituent that includes a carbonyl group and some alkyl chain.

Wait, the IR has a strong peak at 1720, which is a carbonyl. If it's a carboxylic acid, the peak might be around 1700, but sometimes higher. Alternatively, maybe an ester or ketone. But in the NMR, the 10.5 ppm could be a carboxylic acid proton. But wait, carboxylic acids typically have broad signals around 10-12 ppm, but they can sometimes be sharp if deprotonated. Or maybe it's an aldehyde.

Let me think about the options. The options are all substituted benzoic acids or isomers. Let's look:

Option A: 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid. So that's a benzene ring with an ethyl group at position 4, and a propanoic acid substituent at position 2. Wait, no, 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid would have the phenyl group attached to the propanoic acid at the second position? Or maybe it's
