Okay, so I've got this problem about stars and their elemental abundances. Hmm, let's see what it's asking. 

Alright, so there are two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. Their masses are 1.5 and 1.2 times that of the Sun. But I'm not sure if the masses matter here since the question is about elemental abundances. Maybe they're just extra info or not needed for this particular calculation. 

The data given includes some abundance ratios. For Star_1, [Si/Fe]_1 is 0.3 dex. And [Fe/H]_1 is 0. For Star_2, [Mg/Si]_2 is 0.3 dex, and [Mg/H]_2 is 0. 

Wait, I should remember what these brackets mean. Oh right, [X/Y] = log10(n_X / n_Y) - log10(n_X / n_Y)_sun. So it's the logarithmic ratio of the number densities relative to the Sun. 

The question is asking for the ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2. So we need (n_Si_1) / (n_Si_2). 

Let me jot down the given data:

Star_1: 
- [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 → log(n_Si/n_Fe) - log_Sun(n_Si/n_Fe) = 0.3 
- [Fe/H]_1 = 0 → log(n_Fe/n_H) - log_Sun(n_Fe/n_H) = 0 

Star_2:
- [Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3 → log(n_Mg/n_Si) - log_Sun(n_Mg/n_Si) = 0.3 
- [Mg/H]_2 = 0 → log(n_Mg/n_H) - log_Sun(n_Mg/n_H) = 0 

The solar values are given as:
- 12 + log10(n_Fe/n_H) = 7.5 → So log(n_Fe/n_H)_sun = 7.5 - 12 = -4.5 
- 12 + log10(n_Mg/n_H) =7 → log(n_Mg/n_H)_sun =7 -12 =-5 

Wait, wait. Let me make sure I got that right. The Sun's photosphere composition is given as 12 + log10(n_X/n_H) equals some value. So for Fe, it's 7.5. So log(n_Fe/n_H)_sun = 7.5 -12 = -4.5. Similarly, log(n_Mg/n_H)_sun =7-12 = -5.

So for Star_1, [Fe/H]_1 =0. So log(n_Fe/H) - log_Sun(n_Fe/H) )=0 → log(n_Fe/n_H) = log_Sun(n_Fe/n_H) → n_Fe/n_H in Star_1 is same as in Sun.

Similarly, [Si/Fe]_1=0.3 → log(n_Si/n_Fe) - log_Sun(n_Si/n_Fe) )=0.3 → So
