Okay, so I've got this chemistry question here about optical isomerism. Hmm, optical isomerism... right, that's when compounds can rotate plane-polarized light because they have non-superimposable mirror images, meaning they have chiral centers or some form of asymmetry.

The question gives four moieties and asks which show optical isomerism. Let me go through each one.

1. The first compound is dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate. Biphenyl rings connected at position 1, and the substituents are at 2 and 6 positions on each ring. Wait, so the nitro groups are on the 6' positions. Do these positions create any chirality? Well, biphenyls can have axial chirality, right? So if the substituents are arranged in a way that the two rings aren't mirror images, then the compound could be chiral. Let me visualize this. If the substituents on each phenyl ring are in specific positions, maybe the whole molecule isn't symmetrical. The 6 and 6' positions on each ring would create a situation where the two rings are connected in a way that the molecule isn't flat. So yes, this could have optical isomerism because of the possibility of being a meso compound or having a chiral center, but wait, in this case, it's more about the arrangement of the rings. I'm a bit confused but I think biphenyls with substituents in certain positions can lead to cis-trans isomerism, which can lead to optical activity if there's asymmetry. So maybe 1 shows optical isomerism.

2. The second is methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate. Let's break it down. Propanoate ester with a methyl group. The structure is OMe-O-C-O-C-CH2-COH. Wait, wait, the formula would be something like CH3-O-C-O-C(O)H-CH2-OH? No, wait. Wait, 2-hydroxypropanoate: the acid is 2-hydroxypropanoic acid. So the ester is CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3. Wait, no. Wait, propanoate is CH2CH2COO-. So 2-hydroxypropanoate is CH2(OH)CH2COO- as the acid, and when esterified, it's CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3. So the structure would be:

O
||
O-C-OCH3
|
CH2(OH)CH2-

Wait, does this molecule have a chiral center? The central carbon: let me see. The central carbon is the second carbon (since it's 2-hydroxy). So the structure is CH3CH(OH)COOCH3. Wait, that can't be right. Oh wait, no. 2-hydroxypropanoate would be CH2(OH)CH2COO-... Wait, that's not correct. Propanoic acid is CH2CH2COOH. The 2-hydroxy would be on the middle carbon. So the structure is:

CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3. So the middle carbon (the second one) has four different groups: OH, CH2COOCH3, and two CH3 groups? Wait, no. Let me draw it. The molecule is:

O
|
O-C-OCH3 (the ester group)
|
CH2-CH(OH)-CH3

Wait, wait. 2-h
