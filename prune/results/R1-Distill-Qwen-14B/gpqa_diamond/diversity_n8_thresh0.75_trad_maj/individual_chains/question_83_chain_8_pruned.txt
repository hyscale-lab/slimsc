Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem to solve, and I'm a bit rusty on some concepts, but I'll try to think this through step by step. Let's read the question again to make sure I understand it.

The problem says: We dilute 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid with 20.00 cm³ of water. Then we titrate the resulting solution with 0.1 M NaOH. We need to find the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point. The Ka of acetic acid is given as 1.85x10^-5. The options are A to D.

Hmm, okay. So first, when you dilute a solution, you're changing its concentration. So initially, we have 20 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid. Then we add the same volume of water, so the total volume becomes 40 cm³. So the concentration will change. Let me calculate that first.

The initial moles of acetic acid (CH3COOH) can be calculated. Moles = Molarity × Volume (in liters). So 0.05 M × 0.02 L = 0.001 moles. Because 20 cm³ is 0.02 liters. Then, when we add 20 cm³ of water, the volume becomes 40 cm³ (0.04 L). So the new concentration is moles/volume, so 0.001 / 0.04 = 0.025 M. So the diluted acetic acid concentration is 0.025 M.

Wait, but wait. Acetic acid is a weak acid, so when we dilute it, it dissociates more, but the actual concentration of H+ ions will change. But for the initial pH without any titration, maybe we don't need it unless the question requires it. But the question is about the titration points, so maybe it's after adding some NaOH.

So the titration is with 0.1 M NaOH. Let's think about the equivalence point first, maybe, but the problem asks for two points: 25% titration and equivalence point.

Wait, but when you titrate an acid with a base, the equivalence point is when moles of base equal moles of acid. So let's calculate how much NaOH is needed to reach the equivalence point.

The initial moles of acetic acid after dilution: 0.025 M × 0.04 L = 0.001 moles (Wait, no, earlier calculation says 0.001 moles before dilution, then diluted to 0.04 L, so 0.001 / 0.04 = 0.025 M, yes. So moles is 0.001 mol. So I think that's correct.)

So moles of NaOH needed for equivalence is same as moles of acetic acid, which is 0.001 mol. Since NaOH is 0.1 M, volume = moles / Molarity = 0.001 / 0.1 = 0.01 L = 10 cm³. So the equivalence point is when 10 cm³ of NaOH is added.
