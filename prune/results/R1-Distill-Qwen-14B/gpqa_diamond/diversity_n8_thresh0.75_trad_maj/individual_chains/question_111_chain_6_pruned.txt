Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of these reactions. Let's try to break it down step by step. The question has two parts, A and B, each being a different reaction. I'll tackle them one by one.

Starting with reaction A: 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one reacting with ethyl acrylate under the presence of t-BuOK. Hmm, I remember that t-BuOK is a strong, bulky base. This setup sounds familiarâ€”maybe it's an enolate formation reaction. The starting material is a ketone, so the base would deprotonate the alpha position to form an enolate.

Looking at the structure of 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one, the carbonyl is at position 1. The cyclohexane ring has substituents at positions 2 (ethyl), 2 (but wait, 2 and 6 are both methyl?), wait no. Let me think. Wait, the formula is 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethyl. So position 2 has an ethyl group, and position 6 has a methyl group. Wait, wait, no, 2,6-dimethyl would mean positions 2 and 6 both have methyl groups? No, because the main chain is cyclohexanone. Let me visualize the structure. The cyclohexanone ring has a carbonyl at position 1. Then, position 2 has an ethyl group, and position 6 has a methyl group. Wait, but 2 and 6 are across from each other on the ring. Hmm, maybe I should draw it.

But maybe that's getting too detailed. So, the base t-BuOK will deprotonate an alpha hydrogen. The alpha carbons are the
