Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice chemistry question in front of me, and I need to figure out which molecule has C3h symmetry. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my symmetry concepts, but I'll try to work through it.

First, I remember that symmetry in molecules refers to the various planes and axes that leave the molecule looking the same after certain operations. The notation C3h, I think, refers to a type of symmetry involving a three-fold rotation axis and a horizontal mirror plane. Wait, the h in C3h stands for horizontal, right? So the molecule should have a three-fold rotation axis perpendicular to a horizontal mirror plane.

Let me think about each option and their structures.

Option A: triphenyleno[1,2-c:5,6-c':9,10-c'']trifuran-1,3,6,8,11,13-hexaone.

Wait, the name is a bit complicated. Triphenyleno suggests three phenyl groups attached. Trifuran would mean three furan rings, I think. And the numbering is a bit tricky. I'm picturing a structure with three phenyl groups attached to a central part, possibly a tricyclic system. The substitution pattern might be symmetric. But I'm not sure. Let me think about the symmetry here. If the molecule has three substituents arranged symmetrically around a central point, maybe it could have a three-fold axis. But wait, the h in C3h suggests a horizontal mirror plane as well.

Option B: benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran-1,3,4,6,7,9-hexaone.

This one also has a benzo part, so a benzene ring. The trifuran indicates three furan rings attached. The numbering might be such that the substituents are in a symmetric pattern. I'm trying to visualize it. Maybe it's like a central tricyclic structure with benzene rings attached in a symmetrical way. But I'm not certain. Maybe benzene rings are arranged in a way that allows for a three-fold axis?

Option C: triisopropyl borate. So this is (i-Pr)3BO, right? The structure is a borate with three isopropyl groups attached to the boron. So the molecule is trigonal planar around the boron. Wait, each isopropyl group is a -CH(CH3)2 group. So, all three substituents are the same. So the structure should have a three-fold rotational symmetry. But does it have a mirror plane? Let's see: if you look along the B atom
