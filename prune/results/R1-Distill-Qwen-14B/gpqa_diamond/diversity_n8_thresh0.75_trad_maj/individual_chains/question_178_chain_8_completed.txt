Okay, so I've got this question about a Lagrangian and figuring out the mass dimension of κ and whether the theory is renormalizable. Hmm, let me think through this step by step.

First, I remember that in quantum field theory, the mass dimension of a coupling constant determines whether the theory is renormalizable. If the coupling has a positive mass dimension, the theory might be non-renormalizable because it would require higher-order terms that aren't manageable.

The given Lagrangian is L_int = κ ψ̄ σ_{μν} ψ F^{μν}. Oh right, σ_{μν} is (i/2)[γ_μ, γ_ν], which is the antisymmetric product of gamma matrices. And F^{μν} is the field strength tensor for electromagnetism, I think. So this must be some kind of interaction term between fermions and a gauge field, maybe like in a gauge theory.

Wait, but wait. Let me break down each part. The fields involved are ψ (a Dirac spinor) and F^{μν}, which is a field strength tensor. F^{μν} is derived from the gauge field, A, right? So F^{μν} is μν antisymmetric, and because A is a vector (dim 1), F would have a higher dimension. Let me think: each derivative in F is dimension 1, and A is dim 1, so F being ∂A + A^2... Wait, no, F^{μν} is ∂^μ A^ν - ∂^ν A^μ plus terms with A squared. So each term in F has dimension [mass]^1 (from derivative) times [A] which is dimension 1. Wait, no. Wait, wait, the field strength tensor F^{μν} has dimension mass^2, right? Because the derivative has dimension 1, and A has dimension 1, so ∂A would have dimension 2. So F has dimension 2.

So F^{μν} has [F] = mass².

Now, looking at the term ψ̄ σ_{μν} ψ. Since σ is a product of gamma matrices, which are dimensionless (as far as I remember), the term ψ̄ σ ψ should have the same dimension as ψ̄ ψ, right? Because σ is made of gamma matrices, which don't contribute to dimension. So ψ is a spinor, so each ψ has dimension 3/2 (since in four dimensions, the Dirac spinor has dimension 3/2). Therefore, ψ̄ ψ has dimension (3/2) + (3/2) = 3. So the product ψ̄ σ ψ is dimension 3.

So now, the entire term in the Lagrangian is κ multiplied by that. So the dimension of L is [κ] + [ψ̄ σ ψ] + [F^{μν}]. Wait, no, because the Lagrangian is L_int = κ ψ̄ σ ψ F^{μν}. So each term in this product contributes to the dimension.

Wait, each term in the product contributes. So let's compute the mass dimension of each part:

[ψ̄] = 3/2,
[σ_{μν}] = [γ matrices] which are dimensionless, so [σ_{μν}] = 0,
[ψ] = 3/2,
[F^{μν}] = 2.

So the product [ψ̄ σ ψ F^{μν}] is [3/2] + [0] + [3/2] + [2] = 3/2 +3/2 is 3, plus 2 is 5.

But the Lagrangian must have mass dimension 4, because in four spacetime dimensions, the action (integral of L) is dimensionless, so L has dimension 4.

So the Lagrangian L_int = κ * (ψ̄ σ ψ F) must be dimension 4.

So the dimensions: [κ] + [ψ̄ σ ψ F] = 4.

We just calculated [ψ̄ σ ψ F] as 5. So [κ] +5 =4 → [κ]= -1.

So the mass dimension of κ is -1. That narrows it down to options A or C.

Now, the second part is whether the theory is renormalizable. I remember that a theory is renormalizable if all the coupling constants have mass dimension ≤ 4. Wait, no, wait. The rule is that the coupling constants must have a mass dimension ≤ (4 - dimension of the term in the Lagrangian). Wait, no, I think I got that wrong. Let me think again.

In general, in a renormalizable theory, the coupling constants must have a mass dimension ≤ (4 - n), where n is the number of fields in the term. Because each field contributes a certain dimension, and the Lagrangian term must be dimension 4. So for each term in the Lagrangian, the dimension is [coupling] + sum of [fields] =4.

So in a renormalizable theory, the coupling's mass dimension must be ≥ (4 - sum of [fields]). But more precisely, a theory is renormalizable if all the couplings have mass dimension ≥0. Because if the coupling has negative mass dimension, that implies non-renormalizable interactions, as higher-order terms are more relevant.

Wait, maybe I got it backwards. Let me think. A coupling with positive mass dimension would imply that the interaction term becomes stronger at lower energies, which is renormalizable. Wait, no, I'm getting confused.

Wait, another approach. The mass dimension of the coupling constant is given by [κ] = 4 - (sum of the dimensions of the fields in the term) + [field] contributions.

Wait, for each term in the Lagrangian, the term must have dimension 4. So for a term like κ φ^n, the dimension would be [κ] + n [φ] = 4. So [κ] =4 -n [φ].

But in our case, the term is κ ψ̄ σ ψ F^{μν}.

Wait, each ψ is 3/2, so ψ̄ σ ψ is 3 (as before). F is 2. So the product has dimension 3+2=5.

So [κ] +5 =4 → [κ]=-1.

So [κ]=-1. Now, for renormalizability, the coupling's dimension must be ≥0. Because if a coupling has negative mass dimension, that implies that the interaction becomes relevant at higher energies, but more importantly, it's non-perturbative and the theory isn't renormalizable in the usual sense. So because [κ]=-1, which is negative, the theory is not renormalizable.

So the options: looking back, [κ]=-1. So options A and C are possibilities.

Option A says [κ]=-1 and theory renormalizable. But wait, no, because [κ]=-1 is negative, which makes it non-renormalizable. So the theory is not renormalizable. So the correct option would be C: [κ]=-1 and not renormalizable.

Wait, but wait. Sometimes, higher derivative terms are allowed in the Lagrangian—for example, in effective field theories. But in this case, the coupling is dimensionful, so it's non-renormalizable.

So putting it together: [κ]=-1, theory not renormalizable. So the answer is option C.


To determine the mass dimension of the coupling constant $\kappa$ and whether the theory is renormalizable, we analyze the given Lagrangian:

\[
\mathcal{L}_{\text{int}} = \kappa \bar{\psi} \sigma_{\mu\nu} \psi F^{\mu\nu},
\]
where $\sigma_{\mu\nu} = \frac{i}{2}[\gamma_\mu, \gamma_\nu]$ and $F^{\mu\nu}$ is the field strength tensor.

### Step 1: Mass dimension of the Lagrangian term
The Lagrangian $\mathcal{L}_{\text{int}}$ must have mass dimension 4 in four spacetime dimensions, as the action is dimensionless. The term $\kappa \bar{\psi} \sigma_{\mu\nu} \psi F^{\mu\nu}$ contributes to the Lagrangian, so its total dimension must satisfy:

\[
[\kappa] + [\bar{\psi}] + [\sigma_{\mu\nu}] + [\psi] + [F^{\mu\nu}] = 4.
\]

- The Dirac spinor $\psi$ has mass dimension $[\psi] = \frac{3}{2}$, so $[\bar{\psi}] = \frac{3}{2}$.
- The field strength tensor $F^{\mu\nu}$ has mass dimension $[F^{\mu\nu}] = 2$.
- The $\sigma_{\mu\nu}$ term is constructed from the gamma matrices $\gamma_\mu$, which are dimensionless, so $[\sigma_{\mu\nu}] = 0$.

Adding these contributions:
\[
[\bar{\psi}] + [\sigma_{\mu\nu}] + [\psi] + [F^{\mu\nu}] = \frac{3}{2} + 0 + \frac{3}{2} + 2 = 5.
\]

Thus, the coupling constant $\kappa$ must satisfy:
\[
[\kappa] + 5 = 4 \implies [\kappa] = -1.
\]

### Step 2: Renormalizability of the theory
A theory is renormalizable if all coupling constants have non-negative mass dimensions. If a coupling constant has a negative mass dimension, the theory is non-renormalizable because the interaction becomes relevant at high energies, and higher-order terms in the expansion are not manageable.

In this case, $[\kappa] = -1$, which is negative. Therefore, the theory is **not renormalizable**.

### Conclusion
The mass dimension of $\kappa$ is $[\kappa]_M = -1$, and the theory is not renormalizable. This corresponds to **Option C**.
