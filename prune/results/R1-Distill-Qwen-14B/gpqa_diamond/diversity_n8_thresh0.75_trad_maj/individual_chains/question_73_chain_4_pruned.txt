Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on relativity, but let's see what I can figure out.

Alright, the problem says there are two astronauts with masses 2m and 3m. They're moving at 0.6c and 0.5c respectively in the positive x-direction. I need to find their relative speed and the total energy of the system.

Wait, so the question is asking for two things: the relative speed between them and the total energy. Let's tackle each part one by one.

First, the relative speed. I remember that in relativity, you can't just subtract velocities like in classical mechanics. Oh right, you use the velocity addition formula. The formula is (v1 - v2)/(1 - (v1*v2)/(c²)). But wait, which one is moving faster? The first astronaut is at 0.6c, the second at 0.5c. So from the perspective of the second astronaut, the first is moving at 0.1c? Or wait, no, because relativity complicates things.

Wait no, actually, the relative velocity isn't just 0.6c - 0.5c = 0.1c. Because of the way velocities work in relativity, you can't just subtract them. So I need to apply the relativistic velocity addition formula.

So the formula is (v1 - v2) / (1 - (v1*v2)/(c²)). Let me plug in the values. v1 is 0.6c, v2 is 0.5c.

Calculating numerator: 0.6c - 0.5c = 0.1c.

Denominator: 1 - (0.6c * 0.5c)/(c²) = 1 - (0.3 c²)/(c²) = 1 - 0.3 = 0.7.

So v_rel = (0.1c) / 0.7 ≈ 0.142857 c. About 0.14c. So looking at the options, options C and D have 0.14c as relative speed.

Next part is the total energy of the system. Each astronaut has kinetic energy plus their rest mass energy. Wait, but I think in relativity, the total energy is the sum of their rest energies plus their kinetic energies. Or wait, perhaps I should calculate each astronaut's total energy and add them.

Wait, each astronaut's total energy is gamma * m c². So for the first astronaut, mass 2m, moving at 0.6c.

Gamma is 1 / sqrt(1 - (v²/c²)).

For astronaut 1: v = 0.6c. So v²/c² is 0.36. 1 - 0.36 = 0.64. sqrt(0.64) is 0.8. So gamma is 1/0.8 = 1.25. So energy is 1.25 * 2m c² = 2.5 m c².

Wait wait, no. Wait, the astronaut's rest mass is 2m. So the total energy is gamma * rest mass * c². So yes, 1.25 * 2m c² = 2.5 m c².

Astronaut 2: mass
