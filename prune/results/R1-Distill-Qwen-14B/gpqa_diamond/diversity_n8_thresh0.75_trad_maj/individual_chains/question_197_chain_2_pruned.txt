Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem to solve, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll give it a try. Let's see what the question is asking.

The problem says that Compound X reacts with red phosphorus and HI. I remember that red phosphorus and HI are used in the Clemmensen reduction, which reduces ketones to alkanes. So, this reaction is likely a Clemmensen reduction. That means the starting compound must have a ketone group, which after reduction becomes a methylene group.

Let me look at the data provided for Compound X. There's IR and NMR data. I'll need to figure out what the structure of Compound X is first, right?

Starting with the IR data. The peaks are at 3400–2500 cm-1, which usually indicates an O-H stretch, maybe from a carboxylic acid or an alcohol. But wait, there's also a peak at 1720 cm-1. That's a strong carbonyl peak. A carboxylic acid has a carbonyl around 1700 cm-1, but sometimes it's a bit higher. Also, the peak at 1610 and 1450 cm-1 might be from aromatic C=C stretching. So, this suggests that Compound X has a benzene ring and a carbonyl group, maybe a carboxylic acid.

Looking at the NMR data. The 1H NMR shows several peaks:

- 10.5 ppm (bs, 1H): A broad singlet around 10 ppm is typical for an aldehyde proton, but wait, aldehydes are usually around 9-10. But wait, another possibility is a carboxylic acid proton. Wait, carboxylic acid protons are usually broad and around 10-12 ppm. So 10.5 is probably a COOH group.

Wait, but the carbonyl in IR is at 1720, which is more consistent with a ketone or maybe an ester. Hmm, wait, no. Wait, a carboxylic acid's carbonyl is around 1700, but maybe if it's conjugated or something else, it could be higher. Alternatively, maybe it's an ester or a ketone. But the broad peak at 10.5 seems more like a carboxylic acid.

Wait, but if the compound has a ketone, then in NMR, the carbonyl wouldn't have an H attached, so the H NMR wouldn't show a peak at 10.5. Oh wait, no, the 10.5 is for the -OH proton, if it's a carboxylic acid. So if the compound is a ketone, then where would the O-H come from? Maybe an acid is present. Hmm, maybe I'm mixing things up.

Wait, let's think again. The IR shows 3400–2
