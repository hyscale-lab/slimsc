Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about particle physics and kinetic energy. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to think it through step by step. Alright, let's read the question again.

The question is about finding the kinetic energy of the product particles in the decay of a pion. The reaction given is Pi(+) → mu(+) + nu. The pion is at rest, and we're given the rest masses: Pi(+) is 139.6 MeV, and mu(+) is 105.7 MeV. The options are A to D, each giving two KE values. I think one KE is for the muon and the other for the neutrino, but wait, neutrinos are almost massless, so maybe I don't have to consider their rest mass much.

First, I remember that in particle reactions, especially decay processes, the total energy and momentum must be conserved. Since the pion is at rest initially, the total momentum before decay is zero. So, after the decay, the momenta of the muon and neutrino must cancel each other out. But wait, neutrinos are tricky because they have very little mass, so their momentum would be much higher, but I'm not sure how that affects the calculation.

The process involves energy conservation. The rest mass of the pion will be converted into the rest mass of the muon plus the kinetic energies of both the muon and the neutrino. Also, because momentum is conserved, the momenta of the muon and neutrino must be equal in magnitude and opposite in direction.

Let me outline the steps I think I should take:

1. Calculate the rest energy of the pion and muon.
2. Determine the total energy available after the decay.
3. Use conservation of energy and momentum to find the kinetic energies.

Wait, the pion is at rest, so its total energy is just its rest mass energy, which is 139.6 MeV. After decay, the total energy is the sum of the energies of the muon and neutrino.

The muon's energy will be its rest energy plus its kinetic energy. The neutrino's energy is almost entirely kinetic because its rest mass is negligible.

So, energy conservation equation: m_pi c² = (m_mu c² + K_mu) + E_nu.

But E_nu is the total energy of the neutrino, which is approximately equal to its kinetic energy since m_nu ≈ 0. So E_nu ≈ K_nu.

So, 139.6 = (105.7 + K_mu) + K_nu.

Then, the total energy equation is:

K_mu + K_nu = 139.6 - 105.7 = 33.9 MeV.

Hmm, so the sum of the kinetic energies is 33.9 MeV. But how do we distribute that between K_mu and K_nu?

Momentum conservation comes into play. Since the pion is at rest, the total momentum after decay must be zero. So, the muon and neutrino must have equal and opposite momenta.

The momentum of a particle is given by p = sqrt( (E)^2 - (m c²)^2 ) / c. But since we're working in units where c=1, it's simpler. So, p_mu = E_mu^2 - m_mu^2 )^0.5, and p_nu = E_nu, because for the neutrino, m_nu is zero, so E_nu = p_nu.

Since p_mu = p_nu, we have sqrt( E_mu^2 - m_mu^2 ) = E_nu.

But E_mu = m_mu + K_mu, because E_mu is the total energy of the muon (rest energy plus kinetic). So substituting E_mu:

E_nu = sqrt( (m_mu + K_mu)^2 - m_mu^2 )

Hmm, let's square both sides:

E_nu^2 = (m_mu + K_mu)^2 - m_mu^2
E_nu^2 = m_mu^2 + 2 m_mu K_mu + K_mu^2 - m_mu^2
E_nu^2 = 2 m_mu K_mu + K_mu
