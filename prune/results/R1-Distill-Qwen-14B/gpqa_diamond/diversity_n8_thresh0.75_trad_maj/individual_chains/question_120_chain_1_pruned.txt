Okay, so I have this question about stars being uniformly distributed in the sky and how the number of stars per unit range of parallax changes with parallax. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my astronomy, but I'll try to think it through.

Wait, parallax is a measure of distance, right? The closer a star is, the larger its parallax. So parallax (plx) is inversely proportional to distance. Oh, right, because plx = 1/distance (in parsecs). So a star at 1 parsec has a parallax of 1 arcsecond, and at 2 parsecs, it's 0.5, and so on.

The question is about the number of stars per unit range of plx. So like, if I pick a range of parallax, say from plx to plx + dplx, how many stars are there in that range?

Since the stars are uniformly distributed, that means the number density (number per unit volume) is constant. But wait, when we talk about distribution in the sky, how does that translate into distances?

Wait, stars are in all directions, so direction doesn't matter. The key is the volume of space for a given parallax. Oh, right, because for a given parallax range (say, from plx to plx + dplx), we're looking at a shell in space. The volume of that shell will determine how many stars are in it, given uniform distribution.

So the volume between plx and plx + dplx. Let's think about spherical shells. The volume of a sphere is (4/3)πr³. So the volume of the shell between r and r + dr is 4πr² dr. Oh right, because when you subtract the volumes, the (4/3)π(r+dr)^3 minus (4/3)πr^3 gives approximately 4πr² dr when dr is small.

But wait, how does parallax relate to radius? Parallax plx = 1/r, where r is in parsecs. So r = 1/plx. Let's substitute that into the shell volume. So the volume between plx and plx + dplx would be, let's see:

r = 1/plx, so dr = dplx * (d/dplx)(1/plx) ) Wait, maybe it's easier to express everything in terms of plx.

r = 1/plx, so as plx increases, r decreases. So for a shell at radius r, the thickness dr is related to dplx. Let me see
