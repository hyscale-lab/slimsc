Okay, so I have this physics problem about a relativistic harmonic oscillator. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through it step by step.

The question is asking for the maximum speed of a 1-dimensional relativistic harmonic oscillator. The oscillator has mass m and maximum amplitude A. It obeys Hooke's law, which is F = -kx. The speed of light is c.

Wait, I remember that in classical mechanics, for a harmonic oscillator, the maximum speed is given by v_max = sqrt(kA²/m). But that's for non-relativistic cases. Since the problem is relativistic, I can't use that directly because relativistic effects kick in at high speeds.

Relativistic equations... Oh right, in special relativity, the total energy E is given by gamma times mc², where gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²). So the energy isn't just kinetic; it includes the rest mass energy.

The oscillator's potential energy in the classical case is (1/2)kA². But wait, in the relativistic scenario, the potential energy might be treated differently. Or maybe the total energy (kinetic plus potential) has to be considered.

Wait, in a harmonic oscillator, the total energy (classically) is (1/2)kA². But in the relativistic case, the energy would include the rest mass energy and the kinetic energy. Or is it that the potential energy is different?

Hmm. Let me think about the forces. The oscillator is subject to a force F = -kx. So the potential energy U is (1/2)kx². But in relativity, when you have acceleration, you have to consider the proper force, which is the force experienced in the rest frame. But maybe for the purpose of this problem, they're treating the potential energy in the same way.

Wait, the total energy of the oscillator, in the rest frame, would be the sum of the rest energy and the kinetic energy. But when it's moving, its energy increases due to kinetic energy.

Wait, maybe we should set the total energy (including rest mass) equal to the energy from the oscillator's motion. So:

E_total = mc² * gamma + (1/2)mv²?

Wait, no, because in relativistic mechanics, the kinetic energy is (gamma - 1)mc². But perhaps for a harmonic oscillator, the total mechanical energy is the same as the maximum potential energy plus the maximum kinetic energy. But wait, if it's moving, when the oscillator is at maximum displacement (x = A), the velocity is zero, so all energy is potential. At that point, the total energy E is (1/2)kA². But wait, in relativity, the energy includes rest energy, so maybe E = (1/2)kA² + mc²? Or is that mixing classical and relativistic concepts?

Wait, no, no. The rest mass energy is a separate thing. The potential energy is (1/2)kA², and the total energy in the oscillator's frame would be that plus the kinetic energy. But wait, the mass is moving, so the energy must account for relativistic effects.

Alternatively, perhaps the potential energy in the oscillator is (1/2)kA², but the total energy is (gamma) times the rest energy plus the kinetic. Hmm, I'm getting confused.

Wait, maybe I should approach it by considering the energy conservation. The oscillator's total energy is conserved, so at maximum displacement (x=A), the velocity is zero, so all energy is potential. At that point, the total energy E is (1/2)kA². But wait, no, because the rest energy is mc². Wait, perhaps the total energy is (1/2)kA² plus mc²? Hmm, that doesn't quite make sense. Because normally, the rest energy is separate from the mechanical energy.

Wait, perhaps in the relativistic oscillator, the potential energy is (1/2)kx², but the kinetic energy is (gamma - 1) mc². So when the oscillator is at maximum displacement, x = A, velocity is zero, so kinetic energy is zero, so the total energy is just (1/2)kA². But when it's at the equilibrium position, velocity is maximum, so kinetic energy is maximum, and potential is zero. So the total energy at that point is (gamma)(mc²) = (1/2)kA² + (gamma -1) mc².

Wait, perhaps that's not the way. Alternatively, maybe the total energy E is (1/2)kA², which is the maximum potential energy, so when the oscillator is at x=0 (equilibrium), all energy is kinetic, which is (gamma -1) mc² = (1/2)kA².

Wait, but let me think about that. At maximum displacement, x=A, velocity is zero. So the total energy E is (1/2)kA², which equals the rest energy plus the kinetic energy? No, because at maximum displacement, velocity is zero, so kinetic energy is zero. So E = rest energy? But that can't be, because the oscillator's potential energy is (1/2)kA². So perhaps E is (1/2)kA². But that would mean that the rest energy is (1/2)kA², which is only possible if (1/2)kA² = mc². But that's probably not the case. So perhaps I'm approaching this wrong.

Wait, maybe we should model it using relativistic equations of motion. The equation of motion for a relativistic harmonic oscillator isn't the same as the Newtonian one. The force is F = -kx, but F is the relativistic force, which relates to the proper force.

Wait, in special relativity, the correct expression for the force is F = gamma^3 m a, where a is the acceleration. Because in the rest frame, the force is F' = d(mv)/dt, but in other frames, it's more complicated. Alternatively, the relativistic equation of motion for F = ma isn't valid; the correct expression is F = gamma^3 m a.

Wait, but this is getting complicated. Alternatively, perhaps we can model the energy.

The potential energy is U = (1/2)k x^2. The total mechanical energy is E = K + U. In the rest frame of the oscillator, the total energy is E = gamma mc². But when the oscillator is at maximum displacement, velocity is zero, so kinetic energy is zero. So E = (1/2)k A^2 = gamma mc².

Wait, that can't be right because when velocity is zero, gamma is 1, so E would be mc². But (1/2)k A² would have to equal mc². That would mean k A² = 2 mc², which would set the maximum speed to zero, which doesn't make sense. So this approach must be wrong.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused about the frames. Maybe the total energy in the lab frame (where the oscillator is moving) is different. Alternatively, perhaps the potential and kinetic energies are relativistic.

Wait, perhaps the energy in the lab frame is given by E = gamma mc², which is the total energy. But the oscillator's energy also includes the potential and kinetic. So when the oscillator is at maximum displacement, x = A, velocity is zero. So E = (1/2)k A^2 + mc², where mc² is the rest energy. But wait, in the lab frame, the rest energy is already included, so perhaps:

Wait, no. The total energy E is given by E = gamma mc², which is the sum of the rest energy and the kinetic energy. The potential energy is (1/2)k A^2.

But wait, in the lab frame, when the oscillator is at x=A, it's at rest, so the total energy is just (1/2)k A^2 + mc². Is that correct? Or is the potential energy in the lab frame, which is (1/2)k A^2, and the rest energy is mc^2. So E = (1/2)k A^2 + mc^2. But when the oscillator is at x=0, all the energy is kinetic, so E = gamma mc^2. So equating the two, (1/2)k A^2 + mc^2 = gamma mc^2. Which would give (1/2)k A^2 = (gamma - 1) mc^2.

But then, when the oscillator is moving, gamma is greater than 1. Hmm. But I'm not sure if this is the correct approach.

Alternatively, perhaps the potential energy is (1/2)k x^2, and the kinetic energy is (gamma -1) mc^2. Then, the total energy E = (gamma) mc^2 = (1/2)k A^2 + (gamma - 1) mc^2.

Wait, that would mean E = (1/2)k A^2 + gamma mc^2 - mc^2. So E = (1/2)k A^2 + (gamma -1) mc^2.

But wait, at maximum displacement, x=A, velocity is zero, so gamma is 1. So E becomes mc^2 + (1/2)k A^2.

Wait, but when the oscillator is at x=0, velocity is maximum, so gamma is the highest. The total energy would be (gamma) mc^2 = (1/2)k A^2 + (gamma -1) mc^2.

Hmm, maybe I should think in terms of the maximum speed.

Wait, the maximum speed occurs when all the energy is kinetic. So E = (gamma) mc^2 = K + U, but at maximum speed, U is zero. So E = K = (gamma -1) mc^2.

But also, the maximum potential energy is (1/2)k A^2. So E is also (1/2)k A^2 + (1/2) mv_max^2 (classical case). But wait, relativistically, that's not correct because the kinetic energy isn't (1/2) mv^2.

Wait, perhaps the total energy at maximum displacement is (1/2)k A², which equals the rest energy plus the kinetic energy at that point. But wait, when x=A, velocity is zero, so the kinetic energy is zero. So E = (1/2)k A² = mc²? That can't be right unless (1/2)k A² equals mc², which would only happen for a specific value of A.

I'm stuck. Maybe I should look for another approach.

Wait, another way: the equation of motion for a relativistic harmonic oscillator. The force is F = -k x, and F is relativistic, which includes gamma terms.

In Newtonian mechanics, F = m a. But relativistically, the correct expression is F = gamma^3 m a, where a is the acceleration. So F = gamma^3 m (dv/dt).

But integrating that would be complicated. Maybe using energy approach is better.

Alternatively, the total mechanical energy (TME) in the oscillator is E = (1/2)k A^2. But relativistically, the kinetic energy is (gamma -1) mc^2. So when the oscillator is at maximum speed, all the energy is kinetic, so E = (gamma -1) mc^2 = (1/2) k A^2.

So (gamma -1) mc^2 = (1/2)k A^2.

Then, gamma = 1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2).

But gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v^2/c^2).

So:

1/sqrt(1 - v_max^2/c^2) = 1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2).

Let me square both sides to get rid of the square root:

1/(1 - v_max^2/c^2) = [1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2)]^2.

Let me compute the left-hand side (LHS) and the right-hand side (RHS):

LHS = 1/(1 - (v_max^2/c^2)).

RHS = [1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2)]^2.

Let me write 1 - (v_max^2/c^2) = [1/(RHS)].

Wait, no, 1/(1 - v²/c²) = RHS => 1 - v²/c² = 1/(RHS).

Wait, let me rearrange:

1 - v²/c² = 1/[ (1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2))^2 ].

So,

v²/c² = 1 - [1 / (1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2))^2 ].

Take square root of both sides:

v_max/c = sqrt( 1 - [1/(1 + (k A^2/(2 m c^2)))^2 ] ).

Hmm, let me compute that denominator term:

(1 + (k A^2/(2 m c^2)))^2 = 1 + 2 (k A^2)/(2 m c^2) + (k A^2/(2 m c^2))².

Which simplifies to 1 + (k A^2)/(m c^2) + (k² A^4)/(4 m² c^4).

Wait, but maybe there's a simpler way.

Alternatively, let me compute 1/[ (1 + a )^2 ], where a = (k A^2)/(2 m c²).

So 1/(1 + a)^2 = [1/(1 + a)]².

So, v²/c² = 1 - [1/(1 + a)]^2 = [ (1 + a)^2 - 1 ] / (1 + a)^2.

Expanding (1 + a)^2 = 1 + 2a + a².

So numerator is (1 + 2a + a²) -1 = 2a + a².

So,

v²/c² = (2a + a²) / (1 + a)^2.

Factor numerator:

a (2 + a).

Denominator: (1 + a)^2.

So,

v_max = c * sqrt( (a (2 + a)) ) / (1 + a) )

Hmm, but a is (k A²)/(2 m c²). Let me substitute a:

a = (k A^2)/(2 m c^2).

So,

v_max = c * sqrt( [ (k A^2/(2 m c²)) * (2 + k A^2/(2 m c^2)) ) ] / (1 + k A^2/(2 m c²) )^2 )

Simplify the expression under the square root.

Wait, numerator inside sqrt: [a (2 + a)] = (k A²/(2 m c²)) * (2 + (k A²)/(2 m c²)).

Denominator: (1 + a)^2.

So,

sqrt( [a (2 + a)] / (1 + a)^2 ) = sqrt( a (2 + a) ) / (1 + a).

But a is (k A^2)/(2 m c²), so let me see:

Let me factor the numerator:

a (2 + a) = (k A²/(2 m c²)) [ 2 + (k A²/(2 m c²)) ) ]

Which is (k A²/(2 m c²)) [ (4 m c² + k A²) / (2 m c²) ) ]

So,

= (k A² (4 m c² + k A²) ) / (4 m² c^4 )

Hmm, but I'm not sure if this is leading me anywhere.

Alternatively, perhaps I can factor the expression a (2 + a) / (1 + a)^2.

Let me compute:

a (2 + a) / (1 + a)^2 = [ (k A²)/(2 m c²) ) * (2 + (k A²)/(2 m c²)) ] / (1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²))^2.

Let me let u = (k A^2)/(2 m c²).

Then, the expression becomes u (2 + u) / (1 + u)^2.

Expand numerator:

2u + u².

Denominator: (1 + u)^2 = 1 + 2u + u².

So,

[2u + u² ] / [1 + 2u + u² ] = [ u (2 + u) ] / [ (1 + u)^2 ].

Hmm, I don't see an obvious simplification.

Wait, perhaps I can factor u from numerator and denominator. Let's see:

u(2 + u) / (1 + u)^2 = [ u (2 + u) ] / (1 + u)^2.

Alternatively, perhaps I can write it as [ u (2 + u) ] / ( (1 + u)^2 ) = [ u ( (2 + u) ) ] / ( (u +1)^2 ).

But I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe it's easier to write the entire expression in terms of v_max.

Wait, wait. Let me instead think about the initial equation: v_max^2 = c^2 [ 1 - 1/(1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2))^2 ].

So,

v_max^2 = c^2 [ 1 - 1/(1 + a )^2 ] where a = (k A^2)/(2 m c^2).

1/(1+a)^2 = [1/(1+a)]^2.

So,

v_max^2 = c^2 [ ( (1+a)^2 - 1 ) / (1 + a)^2 ) ]

Compute numerator: (1 + a)^2 -1 = 1 + 2a + a^2 -1 = 2a + a^2.

So,

v_max^2 = c^2 [ (2a + a^2) / (1 + a)^2 ]

Which can be written as c^2 [ a (2 + a) / (1 + a)^2 ]

Substitute a = (k A^2)/(2 m c^2):

So,

v_max^2 = c^2 [ (k A²/(2 m c^2)) (2 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2)) ) / (1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2))^2 ]

Let me compute each part:

Denominator: (1 + (k A²)/(2 m c^2))^2 = [ (2 m c^2 + k A^2)/ (2 m c^2) ) ]^2 = (2 m c² + k A^2)^2 / (4 m² c^4 )

Numerator:

(k A²/(2 m c²)) * (2 + (k A²)/(2 m c²)) ) 

= (k A²/(2 m c²)) [ (4 m c² + k A²) / (2 m c²) ) ]

= [ k A² (4 m c² + k A²) ) ] / (4 m² c^4 )

So,

v_max^2 = c^2 * [ (k A² (4 m c² + k A^2) ) / (4 m² c^4 ) ) ] / [ (2 m c^2 + k A^2 )^2 / (4 m² c^4 ) ) ]

The denominators in the numerator and denominator will cancel out:

= c^2 * [ k A² (4 m c^2 + k A^2 ) ] / (2 m c^2 + k A^2 )^2 )

Hmm, that's a bit messy. Let me compute the terms.

Wait, 4 m c² + k A^2 = 2 (2 m c²) + k A^2 = no, that's not helpful.

Wait, the denominator is (2 m c^2 + k A^2 )^2.

Wait, maybe I can factor out (k A^2) from numerator and denominator.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps I can write (k A^2) as a variable, say, let's say b = k A^2.

Then, v_max^2 becomes:

c^2 * [ b (4 m c^2 + b) ) ] / (2 m c^2 + b )^2 )

But I'm not sure if that helps.

Alternatively, perhaps I can write the numerator as b*(4 m c^2 + b ) and denominator as (b + 2 m c^2 )^2.

Wait, but this seems complicated. Maybe there's a better approach.

Wait, perhaps I should consider the options and see which one matches.

Looking at the options:

Option A: v_max = c * sqrt( 1 + 1/(1 - (kA^2)/(2m) )^2 )

Option B: v_max = c * sqrt(1 + 1/(1 - (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 )) )

Option C: v_max = sqrt( k A^2 / m ), which is the classical result.

Option D: v_max = c * sqrt(1 - 1/(1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 ))^2 )

Wait, looking back, I derived that v_max^2 = c^2 [ (2a + a²) ] / (1 + a)^2, where a = (k A^2)/(2 m c^2).

Alternatively, let me compute this expression:

[ (2a + a²) ] / (1 +a )^2 = [ a (2 + a) ] / (1 +a )^2.

Hmm, maybe this can be simplified as [ a (2 + a) ] / (1 + a)^2.

But I'm not seeing a straightforward simplification. Alternatively, perhaps I can factor it as a/(1+a) * (2 + a)/(1+a).

Not sure. Alternatively, perhaps I can write it as a (2 + a) / (1 + a)^2 = [ a (2 + a) ] / (1 + a)^2.

Wait, perhaps I can write 2+a as (1 +a ) + 1.

So,

= a [ (1 + a ) + 1 ] / (1 + a )^2.

= a [ (1 + a )/(1 + a )^2 ) + 1/(1 + a )^2 ) ]

= a [ 1/(1 + a ) + 1/(1 + a )^2 ) ]

Hmm, but again, not sure.

Alternatively, maybe I can compute numerically to see which option matches.

Wait, another approach: when the amplitude A is very small, the relativistic effects are negligible. So in that case, the maximum speed should approach the classical result.

Let me test this.

In the limit where A is very small, (k A^2) / (2 m c^2 ) is much less than 1, so a <<1.

So, a = (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 ) <<1.

Then, 1 + a ≈1 + a, and (1+a)^2 ≈1 + 2a.

Similarly, 2+a ≈ 2.

So,

v_max^2 ≈ c^2 [ (a * 2 ) / (1 + 2a )^2 ) ]

Wait, no, let me plug a <<1 into the expression v_max^2 = c^2 [ (2a + a²)/(1 +a )^2 ].

Since a is small, a² is negligible compared to 2a.

So,

≈ c^2 [ (2a ) / (1)^2 ) ] = 2 a c^2.

But a = (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 ).

So,

v_max^2 ≈ 2 * (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 ) * c^2 = (k A^2 )/(m )

Thus, v_max ≈ sqrt( k A^2 / m ) = sqrt( k A^2/m ), which is the classical result. So this suggests that in the limit of small A, the correct expression should approach option C.

Looking at the options, let's see which ones approach option C when a <<1.

Option A:

v_max = c sqrt(1 + 1/(1 - a )^2 ), where a = (k A^2)/(2m )

Wait, when a <<1, 1 -a ≈1, so 1/(1 -a )² ≈ 1 + 2a.

So,

1 + 1/(1 -a )^2 ≈ 1 + 1 + 2a = 2 + 2a.

v_max ≈ c sqrt(2 + 2a ) = c sqrt( 2 (1 +a ) ) ≈ c sqrt( 2 (1 + a ) )

But in the non-rel limit, v_max is sqrt(k A^2/m ), which is sqrt( (2 m a ) ), since a = (k A^2)/(2m )

Wait, a = (k A^2)/(2m ), so sqrt( (2 m a ) ) = sqrt( (2 m (k A^2)/(2 m )) ) )= sqrt( k A^2 ) = A sqrt(k), which is correct for classical.

Hmm, but the expression in option A would go as c sqrt(2 + 2a ), which would be c sqrt( something larger than 2 ), which doesn't match the classical limit.

Option B: v_max =c sqrt(1 +1/(1 - (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 )) )

Again, when a' = (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 ) <<1, then 1/(1 - a') ≈ 1 +a'.

So,

1 + [1/(1 - a') ] ≈ 1 + (1 + a') ) = 2 + a'.

So,

v_max ≈ c sqrt(2 + a' )

Again, this would approach c sqrt(2) when a' is zero, which is larger than the classical limit. Not matching.

Option D: v_max =c sqrt( 1 - 1/(1 + a )^2 ), where a = (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 )

When a <<1, 1/(1+a )^2 ≈1 -2a.

So,

1 - [1 - 2a ] = 2a.

So,

v_max ≈ c sqrt(2a )

Which is c sqrt( 2 * (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 ) ) )= c sqrt( (k A^2)/(m c^2 ) ) )

= c * (A sqrt(k/(m c^2 )) )

But that's not the same as the classical limit. Hmm, but wait:

Wait, the classical v_max is sqrt( (k A^2 )/m ), which is A sqrt(k/m).

In option D's approximation, it's c * sqrt( (k A^2 )/(m c²) ) ) = sqrt( (k A^2)/(m c²) ) * c = sqrt( (k A^2 c^2 )/(m c²) ) ) = sqrt( k A^2 / m ) ), which matches the classical result. So in the limit of small a, option D gives the correct result.

Wait, let me redo that:

In option D, when a <<1,

v_max ≈ c * sqrt( 2a ) 

But a = (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 )

So,

2a = (k A^2 )/( m c^2 )

So,

sqrt( 2a ) = sqrt( (k A^2 )/( m c² ) ) ) 

Thus,

v_max ≈ c * sqrt( (k A^2 )/( m c² ) ) ) = sqrt( (k A^2 c² )/( m c² ) ) ) = sqrt( k A^2 / m ), which is correct.

So option D approaches the classical result correctly.

Looking back, I derived that v_max^2 = c^2 [ (2a + a^2 )/(1 +a )^2 ] where a = (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 )

If I compute this expression, perhaps it can be rewritten in terms of the options.

Wait, let me write the expression I have:

v_max = c * sqrt( [ (2a + a^2) ] / (1 + a )^2 )

= c * sqrt( [ a (2 + a) ] / (1 + a )^2 )

Which is c * sqrt( a (2 +a ) ) / (1 +a )

But none of the options directly match this.

Wait, looking back at the options:

Option D: v_max = c sqrt( 1 - 1/(1+a )^2 ), where a = (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 )

Wait, let me compute 1 -1/(1 + a )^2:

= [ (1 +a )^2 -1 ] / (1 +a )^2 

= [1 + 2a +a² -1 ] / (1 +a )^2 

= (2a + a^2 ) / (1 +a )^2 

Which is exactly the expression I have under the square root.

So,

v_max = c * sqrt( (2a + a^2 )/(1 +a )^2 ) 

= c * sqrt( 1 - 1/(1 +a )^2 ), which is Option D.

Wait, no. Because 1 - 1/(1 +a )^2 is (2a +a^2 )/(1 +a )^2.

So,

v_max = c * sqrt( (2a +a^2 )/(1 +a )^2 )

Which is equal to c * sqrt( 1 - 1/(1 +a )^2 )

So option D is exactly this.

Wait, option D is written as:

v_max = c sqrt( 1 - 1/(1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 ))^2 )

Which matches.

So the correct answer is option D.

Wait, but looking back at the options:

Option D: v_max = c*sqrt(1−1/(1+ (kA^2)/(2 m c^2 ))^2 )

Yes, that's exactly what we have.

So I think the correct answer is option D.


To determine the maximum speed \( v_{\text{max}} \) of a 1-dimensional relativistic harmonic oscillator with mass \( m \), maximum amplitude \( A \), and obeying Hooke's law \( F = -kx \), we analyze the relativistic energy conservation. The total energy of the oscillator is conserved and includes both rest energy and relativistic kinetic energy. 

At maximum displacement (\( x = A \)), the velocity is zero, and all energy is potential energy:  
\[
E = \frac{1}{2}kA^2.
\]  
At the equilibrium position (\( x = 0 \)), the velocity is maximum, and all energy is relativistic kinetic energy:  
\[
E = (\gamma - 1)mc^2,
\]  
where \( \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}} \). Equating the two expressions for \( E \), we solve for \( \gamma \):  
\[
\gamma = 1 + \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}.
\]  

Substituting \( \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}} \), we get:  
\[
\frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}} = 1 + \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}.
\]  

Squaring both sides:  
\[
\frac{1}{1 - v^2/c^2} = \left(1 + \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}\right)^2.
\]  

Rearranging for \( v^2/c^2 \):  
\[
1 - v^2/c^2 = \frac{1}{\left(1 + \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}\right)^2}.
\]  

\[
v^2/c^2 = 1 - \frac{1}{\left(1 + \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}\right)^2}.
\]  

Taking the square root:  
\[
v_{\text{max}} = c \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{\left(1 + \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}\right)^2}}.
\]  

This matches **Option D**. To confirm, we test the classical limit (\( A \to 0 \), \( \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2} \ll 1 \)):  
\[
v_{\text{max}} \to c \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{\left(1 + 0\right)^2}} = c \sqrt{1} = c \cdot 0 = \sqrt{\frac{kA^2}{m}},
\]  
which recovers the classical result. Thus, the correct answer is:

**Answer: D**
