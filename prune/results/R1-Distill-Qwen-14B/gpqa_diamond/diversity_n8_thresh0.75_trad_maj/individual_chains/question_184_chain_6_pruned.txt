Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. The question is about determining the correct sequence of reactions to synthesize a specific compound starting from benzene. The target molecule is 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene. Hmm, that's a mouthful. Let me break it down.

First, I'll draw the structure of the target molecule to visualize it better. So, benzene ring with three substituents: a tert-butyl group, an ethoxy group, and a nitro group. The positions are 1, 2, and 3. Let me number the ring: position 1 is ethoxy, position 2 is tert-butyl, and position 3 is nitro. Wait, no, wait. Wait, the IUPAC name is 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene. So the numbering starts with the ethoxy at position 1, tert-butyl at 2, and nitro at 3. So, the substituents are at positions 1, 2, and 3. So on the benzene ring, positions 1, 2, and 3 have substituents. That's adjacent positions, like a meta arrangement but all three in a row? Wait, no, benzene is a ring. Wait, if positions 1, 2, and 3 are adjacent, that's a 1,2,3-trisubstituted benzene. Hmm, but I think in practice, when you have substituents in such positions, directing effects matter.

Now, the reaction steps start with benzene. So we need to introduce the substituents in the correct order, considering the directing effects of each group.

The substituents in the target molecule are:

1. tert-butyl (a strong activating, o/p-directing group)
2. ethoxy (a strong activating, o/p-directing group)
3. nitro (a strong deactivating, m-directing group)

Wait, but wait: the nitro group is a meta director, while the tert-butyl and ethoxy are ortho/para directors. But the order in which these groups are added will affect where the next substituent goes.

Let me think about the possible order of introducing these groups. Since nitro is a meta director, it's often introduced last because
