Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the molecular symmetry group of product E. Let me try to break down the reactions step by step.

First, the problem describes a series of reactions. Let me list out what each reaction does.

1. Solid A reacts with 8 equivalents of gas B to form bright red product C.
2. C reacts with 2 equivalents of gas D to produce product E, which is extremely hazardous.
3. C reacts with water to reform A plus two different acids F and G. F is a strong acid, G is a weak acid.
4. D reacts with B in a 1:1 ratio to form H, which is used as a solvent.

Hmm. I need to figure out what these compounds are. Let's start by figuring out what each substance could be.

Looking at the first reaction: A + 8 B → C. Since 8 is a large number, maybe B is a diatomic gas. Like oxygen (O2), which is diatomic. So 8 equivalents of O2 would be 8 moles, perhaps. What solid A reacts with O2 to form a red product C?

Wait, bright red product. That makes me think of something like silver oxide? Or maybe another red solid. Alternatively, maybe it's a transition metal oxide. Let me think: Copper(II) oxide is black, not red. Iron(III) oxide is reddish. Oh, wait! What about lead dioxide? PbO2 is dark brown, but maybe in some form it can appear red? Or perhaps it's another compound.

Wait, another possibility: when a metal reacts with O2, especially in a high ratio, maybe forming a higher oxidation state. Let's think about how many equivalents are involved. 8 equivalents of B (if B is O2, then 8 moles of O2). So for a metal M, the reaction would be M + O2 → M_oxides. The stoichiometry would depend on the metal and the oxidation state.

Wait, another approach: when a metal like sulfur is involved? Alternatively, maybe the product C is SO3^2- or something else. Hmm, perhaps I'm complicating.

Let me shift focus. The third reaction: C reacts with water to form A, and two acids F and G. F is a strong acid, G is weak. So when C (which I think is a metal oxide or maybe a sulfide) reacts with water, it produces the metal hydroxide (which becomes A again), and two acids.

Wait, no. Let's think: acids F and G are formed. So C must be an oxide that, when reacted with water, gives an acid. Wait, but A is a solid. If C is an oxide, then reacting with water would give a metal hydroxide (maybe A) and some acid. Alternatively, if C is a sulfide, perhaps.

Wait, another thought: when a metal oxide reacts with water, it forms a metal hydroxide, but that's not an acid. Wait, but maybe C is a non-metal oxide. For example, SO3 is a gas, but when it reacts with water, it forms H2SO4 (a strong acid) and another product? Wait, no, SO3 + H2O → H2SO4, which is a strong acid. But that would only produce one acid. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps C is something like a sulfate or sulfite. Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let me try another angle.

Looking at reaction 4: D reacts with B (in 1:1) to form H, which is a solvent. Common solvents include water, ethanol, methanol, maybe. But B is gas—so B is probably O2, since it's a common gas. If B is O2, then D is another gas. When O2 and D react 1:1 to form H, which is a solvent. Let's think of possible reactions.

Wait, for instance, if D is H2, then O2 + H2 → H2O. But H2O is a solvent. Alternatively, D could be something else. Let me think about other possibilities. Maybe D is CO, and B is O2. Then O2 + CO → CO2. But CO2 is a gas, not a solvent. Hmm.

Wait, another thought: perhaps D is NH3. But NH3 is a gas, and when it reacts with O2, what happens? Maybe oxidation
