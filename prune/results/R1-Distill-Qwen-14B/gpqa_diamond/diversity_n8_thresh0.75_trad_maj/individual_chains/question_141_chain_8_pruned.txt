Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out how many possible organic products form when 1-bromobenzene-2-d is treated with NaNH2 in a condensed ammonia solvent. Hmm, let me think through this step by step.

First, I should probably recall what NaNH2 does in such reactions. From what I remember, NaNH2 is a strong base, often used in dehydrohalogenation reactions. It's a good source of hydroxide ions, right? So when it reacts with a haloarene, like bromobenzene, it probably causes an elimination reaction, maybe forming a benzene ring with a double bond, like a benzene with a substituent that's deprotonated.

Wait, but wait, the compound here is 1-bromobenzene-2-d. Oh, wait, 2d? Or maybe I misread. Oh, wait, maybe the formula is C6H4BrD? Or perhaps it's a typo and it's 1-bromo-2-dimethylbenzene? No, wait, probably the correct structure is 1-bromo-2-dimethylbenzene. Wait, but the way it's written, 1-bromobenzene-2-d. Oh, maybe it's 1-bromo-2,2-dimethylbenzene? Or 1-bromo-2-methylbenzene? Or perhaps the 'd' stands for something else. Wait, maybe the 'D' is a deuterium? Wait, no, the way it's written, 1-bromobenzene-2-d, maybe
