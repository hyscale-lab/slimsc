Okay, so I'm trying to solve this chemistry problem. Let me read it carefully.

The question is about a series of reactions, and based on that, I need to determine the molecular symmetry group of product E. The options are symmetry groups like C2, D4h, D∞h, and C2v.

Hmm, let's break down the reactions step by step. 

First reaction: Solid A reacts with 8 equivalents of gas B to form bright red product C. I remember that some red products in chemistry are like copper(II) compounds or maybe something else. Wait, 8 equivalents is a lot. Maybe B is a diatomic gas, like O2 or Cl2?

Second reaction: C reacts with 2 equivalents of gas D to produce E, which is extremely hazardous. Hazardous products could be things like phosgene, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe E is something like SO2 or another toxic gas.

Third reaction: C reacts with water to reform A and two different acids F and G. F is a strong acid, G is weak. So, when C is treated with water, it produces a strong acid and a weak one. Strong acids are like HCl, H2SO4, etc. Weak acids are things like acetic acid.

Fourth reaction: D reacts with B in a 1:1 ratio to form H, which is used as a solvent. So, H is a solvent. Common solvents could be H2O, but that's not reacting with B. Wait, D plus B in 1:1. If B is O2, then D might be something that reacts with O2 to make a solvent. Wait, what about H2O being a solvent? No, because D is a gas, and B is a gas. So if B is O2, and D is H2, then they react in 2:1 ratio to make H2O. But the ratio here is 1:1. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe B is Cl2, and D is something else.

Wait, let me think again.

Let me try to map out possible reactions.

Reaction 1: A + 8 B → C (bright red)
Reaction 2: C + 2 D → E (extremely hazardous)
Reaction 3: C + H2O → A + F (strong acid) + G (weak acid)
Reaction 4: D + B → H (solvent) in 1:1 ratio.

Let me think about possible candidates for each substance.

Let's start with reaction 3. C reacts with water to give A, F, and G. Suppose C is an acid anhydride because when anhydrides react with water, they produce acids. Alternatively, maybe a metal oxide reacting with water to form a base and acid, but that depends.

Wait, if C is an anhydride, like SO3 (sulfur trioxide), which is a gas. When SO3 reacts with water, it forms H2SO4, which is a strong acid, and maybe another component? Wait, SO3 + H2O → H2SO4. That's a 1:1 reaction. But in reaction 3, it produces two acids, F and G. So maybe C is a compound that upon hydrolysis gives two different acids.

Wait, another possibility: maybe C is a metal sulfate or something. Alternatively, C could be a mixed anhydride.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a nitrate or another compound.

Wait, another approach. Let's think about the possible products. Since F is a strong acid and G is a weak acid, when C is hydrolyzed, it breaks down into these acids.

Wait, maybe C is a sulfite or something else. Alternatively, perhaps C is a superoxide or another oxygen-containing compound.

Wait, another angle: reaction 4. D and B react in 1:1 ratio to form H, a solvent. So D + B → H. Let's think about common solvents. For example, ethanol, water, acetone, etc. Let's say H is H2O. Then D + B must form H2O. Suppose B is O2 (so D would need to be H2, since 2H2 + O2 → 2H2O, but that's 2:1 ratio. But the question says 1:1. So that doesn't fit.

Wait, if B is Cl2, perhaps D is H2. Then Cl2 + H
