Okay, so I'm trying to figure out why the GADD45G protein isn't being overexpressed in the transgenic mouse model. Let me break down the problem step by step.

The question describes a scenario where someone is trying to create a transgenic mouse model by overexpressing the GADD45G gene. They modified the gene to include a sequence for the influenza hemagglutinin antigen at the N-terminus. They used Lipofectamine to transfect Chinese hamster ovary cells and selected antibiotic-resistant colonies. But when they tested the expression, the protein wasn't overexpressed.

The provided DNA sequence is the plus strand of their construct. I need to look for possible issues in this sequence that would prevent proper expression.

First, I should probably check if the reading frame is correct because any in-frame stop codon could terminate translation early. The sequence starts with ATG, which is the start codon. Then I'll scan through to see if there's a stop codon (TAA, TAG, or TGA) in frame.

Looking at the sequence: after ATG, the next codons are TAC (tyrosine), CCA (proline), CAT (histidine), etc. Let me go through each codon.

Wait, wait, I'll need to translate the mRNA to see if there's an early stop. But wait, the sequence provided is DNA, the coding strand. So to get the mRNA, we take the DNA and replace T with U, but it's the same as the coding strand, so the mRNA would be the same except T becomes U.

Wait, no. The DNA is the plus strand, which is the same as the mRNA except for T to U. So the mRNA is the same as the plus DNA, except Ts become Us.

So the mRNA starts: AUG UAC CC A... Hmm, let me actually write out the mRNA sequence.

Wait, no, maybe it's easier to look for stop codons in the DNA, considering that the mRNA would be the same except for T to U. So in DNA, the stop codons for mRNA would be:

- TAA becomes UAA (stop)
- TAG becomes UAG (stop)
- TGA becomes UGA (stop)

So looking through the DNA sequence for these triplets.

Let me go through the DNA sequence in triplets, keeping in mind that the reading frame starts at ATG (position 1,2,3). So each codon is triplet starting from position 1.

Looking at the first few:

ATG TAC CCA TAC GAT GTT CCA GAT TAC GCC AAA TGA CTT GGA AGA GTC CGC GGC CAG GAC ACA GTT CCG GAA AGC ACA GCC AGG ATG CAG GGT GCC GGG GAA AGC GCT GCA GAG TTA GCT GCT GTC GGC GCC AGC GTC AGG GCT GCC TCA CTC CGG CGT CTAC GAG TCA GCC AAA GTC TTA GAC GGT GAC CCG ACA ATG TGA CTT CTG TGT GCT GGC TGC GGG TGA GGAG GAC GAG GGC GAC ATC GCG CTG CAG ATC CTT TTA CGC TGA TCC AGG CT TCT GCT GCG AGA AC CAC TCG GAC ATG TGC CGC TGG GCG ATG TGC AGC GGC TGG CGG CTG CGT GGG CGC CGC GAG GAG GCG GGG TGC CGC GGC GAC CTG CAC TGC ATC CTC ATT TCG AAC CCC CAG GAC GCG CTT GGA AGA GCT CAG CCG TTT TGC GAG GAG AGC GCG CGT TAA CGA TGG GTG CCC AGC ATC ACC CTC CCC GAG TGA

Wait, that's a bit confusing. Let me try to parse it correctly.

Alternatively, perhaps I should look for any occurrence of TAA, TAG, or TGA in the DNA sequence, considering the reading frame.

Wait, the construct starts with ATG, which is the start codon. So the reading frame is correct.

Let me go through the DNA sequence and look for any in-frame stop codon.

Looking from ATG onwards:

ATG TAC CCA TAC GAT GTT CCA GAT TAC GCC AAA TGA CTT GGA ...

Wait, at position... So the first codon is ATG (1-3), then TAC (4-6) which is tyrosine, then CCA (7-9) proline, TAC (10-12) tyrosine, GAT (13-15) aspartic acid, GTT (16-18) valine, CCA (19-21) proline, GAT (22-24) aspartic acid, TAC (25-27) tyrosine, GCC (28-30) alanine, AAA (31-33) lysine, TGA (34-36) stop.

Oh wait, so at positions 34-36, we have TGA in the DNA, which in the mRNA would be UGA, a stop codon. So the construct has a stop codon at codon 11 (since 34-36 is the 12th codon, but wait, starting from 1, each 3 nucleotides is a codon. So ATG is 1-3, TAC 4-6, etc. So codon 12 is TGA, which is a stop.

That's a problem because the stop codon would terminate translation early, preventing the full-length protein from being expressed. So the researchers expected to overexpress GADD45G
