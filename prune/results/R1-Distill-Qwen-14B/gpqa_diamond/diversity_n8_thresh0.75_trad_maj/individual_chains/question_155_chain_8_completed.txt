Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through step by step. Let me read the question carefully.

The question is about finding the uncertainty in the P_z operator. The system is in an eigenstate of P_x with a specific eigenvalue. The state is given as a column vector. I remember that the uncertainty in an observable is calculated using the variance formula, which involves the expectation value of the operator squared minus the square of the expectation value of the operator.

Hmm, so the formula for the uncertainty ΔP_z would be the square root of <P_z²> - <P_z>². Right, that's the standard formula from quantum mechanics.

But wait, the system is in an eigenstate of P_x. Does that mean that the expectation values will be related to P_x's eigenvalues? Or do I need to compute them directly?

I think I need to compute <P_z> and <P_z²> for the given state. But wait, the given state is in the eigenbasis of P_z, right? Because the basis vectors are the eigenvectors of P_z. So the state is expressed in that basis, which might make things easier.

Wait, no, the basis vectors are the eigenvectors of P_z, which implies that the state provided is already expressed in the P_z eigenbasis. Because the basis vectors are |+⟩ (eigenvalue +ħ), |0⟩ (eigenvalue 0), and |−⟩ (eigenvalue -ħ), perhaps. Or maybe the basis is ordered as |↑⟩, |→⟩, |↓⟩ or something else. Wait, no, because P_z's matrix is diagonal, as given in the problem statement.

Looking at the matrix for P_z, it's diagonal with entries ħ, 0, -ħ. So the basis vectors are probably |+⟩, |0⟩, |−⟩, with eigenvalues ħ, 0, -ħ respectively.

The given state is a column vector: [-1/2, 1/sqrt(2), -1/2]. So the state is a linear combination of these basis vectors.

Wait, but how does this relate to the expectation values? Because if the state is written in the eigenbasis of P_z, calculating <P_z> should be straightforward.

Wait, the state is |ψ> = [a, b, c]^T, where a = -1/2, b=1/sqrt(2), c=-1/2. So in terms of the basis vectors, the state is a|+⟩ + b|0⟩ + c|−⟩.

But each of these basis vectors has a definite P_z value: |+⟩ has +ħ, |0⟩ has 0, |−⟩ has -ħ.

Hmm, so the expectation value <P_z> would be a*(ħ) + b*(0) + c*(-ħ) = (a - c)ħ.

Wait, let's plug in the values: a is -1/2, c is -1/2. So ( (-1/2) - (-1/2) ) * ħ = 0. So <P_z> is zero.

What about <P_z²>? Since P_z is diagonal in this basis, the square would have eigenvalues squared. So each basis vector's contribution is (eigenvalue)^2.

So <P_z²> would be a*(ħ^2) + b*(0) + c*(ħ^2) because (-ħ)^2 is ħ^2.

So let's compute that: [ (-1/2) * ħ² ] + [ (1/sqrt(2)) * 0 ] + [ (-1/2) * ħ² ].

Wait, that simplifies to (-1/2 -1/2) * ħ² = (-1) * ħ². Wait, that can't be right because expectation values can't be negative if the operator is Hermitian and the state is normalized.

Wait a second, that doesn't make sense. Because P_z is Hermitian, its eigenvalues are real, and the expectation value should be real as well. But the calculation for <P_z²> suggests a negative value, which is impossible.

Ah, wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me re-calculate that. The state is [a, b, c]^T. So for each component, the coefficient a corresponds to |+⟩, which has eigenvalue +ħ. So a^2 * (ħ)^2 is part of <P_z²>?

Wait, no, the expectation value <P_z²> is sum |a_i|^2 * (eigenvalue_i)^2.

Wait, no, wait, maybe I'm mixing things up. Let me think again.

The state is |ψ⟩ = a|+⟩ + b|0⟩ + c|−⟩, where |+⟩ has eigenvalue +ħ, |0⟩ has 0, |−⟩ has -ħ.

So the expectation value of P_z is a*ħ + c*(-ħ).

But for <P_z²>, it's a* (ħ)^2 + c*(ħ)^2. Because the square of the eigenvalue is (ħ)^2 for both |+⟩ and |−⟩.

So <P_z²> = ( |a|^2 + |c|^2 ) * ħ².

Because for each component, the contribution is |coefficient|^2 multiplied by (eigenvalue)^2.

So let's compute |a|^2 and |c|^2.

a is -1/2, so |a|^2 is (1/2)^2 = 1/4.

Similarly, c is -1/2, so |c|^2 is also 1/4.

So |a|^2 + |c|^2 is 1/4 + 1/4 = 1/2.

So <P_z²> = (1/2) * ħ².

And earlier I found that <P_z> is zero.

Then the variance is <P_z²> - <P_z>² = (1/2 ħ²) - 0 = (1/2) ħ².

The uncertainty ΔP_z is the square root of that, which is sqrt(1/2) ħ = ħ / sqrt(2).

Wait, but looking at the options, option B is ħ/sqrt(2), and option C is ħ/2.

So the uncertainty would be option B.

Wait, but let me double-check the normalization of the state. The state must satisfy |a|^2 + |b|^2 + |c|^2 = 1.

a is -1/2, so |a|^2 is 1/4.

b is 1/sqrt(2), |b|^2 is 1/2.

c is -1/2, |c|^2 is 1/4.

Adding them: 1/4 + 1/2 + 1/4 = (0.25 + 0.5 + 0.25) = 1. So yes, the state is normalized.

So the calculation seems correct. Therefore, the uncertainty is ħ/sqrt(2), so the answer should be option B.


To determine the uncertainty $\Delta P_z$ of the operator $P_z$, we use the formula:

\[
\Delta P_z = \sqrt{\langle P_z^2 \rangle - \langle P_z \rangle^2}.
\]

The system is in the eigenstate of $P_x$ with the given column vector:

\[
|\psi\rangle = \begin{bmatrix} -\frac{1}{2} \\ \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \\ -\frac{1}{2} \end{bmatrix}.
\]

### Step 1: Basis and Expectation Values
The basis vectors are the eigenvectors of $P_z$, corresponding to eigenvalues $\hbar$, $0$, and $-\hbar$. The state $|\psi\rangle$ is expressed as a linear combination of these basis vectors:

\[
|\psi\rangle = a|+\rangle + b|0\rangle + c|-\rangle,
\]

where $a = -\frac{1}{2}$, $b = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}$, and $c = -\frac{1}{2}$. The eigenvalues of $P_z$ are $\hbar$ for $|+\rangle$, $0$ for $|0\rangle$, and $-\hbar$ for $|-\rangle$.

### Step 2: Compute $\langle P_z \rangle$
The expectation value $\langle P_z \rangle$ is:

\[
\langle P_z \rangle = a\hbar + b(0) + c(-\hbar) = (a - c)\hbar.
\]

Substituting $a = -\frac{1}{2}$ and $c = -\frac{1}{2}$:

\[
\langle P_z \rangle = \left(-\frac{1}{2} - \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)\right)\hbar = 0.
\]

### Step 3: Compute $\langle P_z^2 \rangle$
The operator $P_z^2$ has eigenvalues $(\hbar)^2$, $0$, and $(\hbar)^2$ for the basis vectors $|+\rangle$, $|0\rangle$, and $|-\rangle$, respectively. The expectation value $\langle P_z^2 \rangle$ is:

\[
\langle P_z^2 \rangle = |a|^2(\hbar)^2 + |b|^2(0)^2 + |c|^2(\hbar)^2 = (|a|^2 + |c|^2)\hbar^2.
\]

The coefficients are $|a|^2 = \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)^2 = \frac{1}{4}$ and $|c|^2 = \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)^2 = \frac{1}{4}$. Thus:

\[
\langle P_z^2 \rangle = \left(\frac{1}{4} + \frac{1}{4}\right)\hbar^2 = \frac{1}{2}\hbar^2.
\]

### Step 4: Compute $\Delta P_z$
The variance is:

\[
\langle P_z^2 \rangle - \langle P_z \rangle^2 = \frac{1}{2}\hbar^2 - 0 = \frac{1}{2}\hbar^2.
\]

The uncertainty is the square root of the variance:

\[
\Delta P_z = \sqrt{\frac{1}{2}\hbar^2} = \frac{\hbar}{\sqrt{2}}.
\]

### Final Answer
The uncertainty $\Delta P_z$ is $\frac{\hbar}{\sqrt{2}}$. Comparing with the options, the correct answer is:

**B) $\hbar/\sqrt{2}$**

Answer: B
