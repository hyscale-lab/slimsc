Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me read through it again and break it down.

Alright, the first part is about 1,3-dibromoadamantane being heated with excess KOH, producing a light yellow solid product 1. Then, product 1 is heated with excess aluminum isopropoxide to form product 2. After that, ozone is bubbled through a solution of product 2 at -78°C, followed by adding dimethylsulfide to give product 3. The question is about the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen in product 3's 1H NMR spectrum.

Hmm. Let me start by thinking about each step. 

First reaction: 1,3-dibromoadamantane with KOH. Dibromides with KOH usually undergo elimination. Since it's a dihalide, probably an E2 elimination occurs. The structure of adamantane is a diamondoid, so 1,3-dibromo would have two bromines on adjacent carbons? Wait, no. Wait, adamantane has a structure with four fused cyclohexane rings. The 1,3-dibromoadamantane would have two bromine atoms on different positions of the adamantane structure.

Heating with KOH (a strong base) would likely lead to dehydrohalogenation. So each Br would be removed, and two elimination reactions could happen. But wait, since both bromines are on the same adamantane structure, when they eliminate, they might form a diene? Or maybe an allene? No, wait, elimination would typically form a double bond. But with two adjacent Br atoms, perhaps it's a vicinal dihalide, so elimination would form a double bond between the two carbons where the Brs were.

Wait, but 1,3-dibromoadamantane—so the positions are 1 and 3 on the adamantane. Looking at the structure, if they are not adjacent, elimination might not form a single double bond. Hmm, perhaps it's a transannular elimination. Alternatively, maybe it's a bicyclic structure where the two Brs are on adjacent carbons, leading to the formation of a double bond when KOH abstracts a beta hydrogen.

Wait, but the product is a solid. The product 1's 1H NMR shows a triplet at 4.79 ppm (2H), which is around where a CH2 group adjacent to an oxygen might appear. Also, there's a peak at 1
