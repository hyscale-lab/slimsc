Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here. Let me try to work through it step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll give it a shot.

The question starts by talking about Compound A. So, it's showing two signals in the proton NMR. The first is a triplet at 0.9 ppm for 6H, and a quartet at 1.3 ppm for 4H. Hmm, I remember that NMR signals can tell us about the structure of the molecule. Let's think about what these signals could mean.

A triplet usually implies that each proton is adjacent to two protons on neighboring carbons. So, maybe it's a -CH2-CH2- group where the first CH2 is next to another CH2. The 0.9 ppm is a low shift, which suggests maybe a methyl group attached to something, like a CH2 group. Wait, because 0.9 is typical for CH3 groups, especially in something like an ethyl group. So, if it's a triplet, perhaps it's a methyl group attached to a CH2 that's next to another CH2. Let me think, like maybe a diethyl group or something like that.

The quartet at 1.3 ppm for 4H. A quartet means each proton is next to three others. Wait, no, quartet is four peaks, which usually comes from being next to a CH2 group, because each proton in the quartet is split by two neighboring protons. So, 4H split into a quartet—so maybe a CH2 adjacent to another CH2. But wait, if the splitting is from a CH2, each of the four H's (like two CH2 groups) would show as a quartet. Alternatively, maybe it's a single CH2 group next to another CH2. Or perhaps a geminal di-substitution? No, that's not likely. Or maybe it's a -CH2CH2- group where each is next to another CH2.

Wait, putting this together: 6 H as a triplet—so perhaps two CH3 groups, each attached to a CH2. Because each CH3 (3H) would give a triplet if they are next to a CH2. Wait, two CH3 groups attached to a CH2. Let me think. If it's a structure like CH2CH2CH3, but that's not possible. Maybe it's a ethyl group attached to something else. Wait, perhaps a diethyl ether? No, that would have different NMR. Alternatively, maybe it's a cyclopropane? No, not sure.

Wait, another approach
