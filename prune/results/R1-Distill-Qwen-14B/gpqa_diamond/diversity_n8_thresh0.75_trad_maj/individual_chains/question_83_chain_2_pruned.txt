Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again.

The question says: We dilute 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid with 20.00 cm³ of water. Then, we titrate the resulting solution with 0.1 M NaOH at 25°C. We need to find the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point. The Ka of acetic acid is given as 1.85x10^-5. The options are A to D.

Hmm, let me break this down. First, I think I should calculate the concentration of the acetic acid after dilution. Then, when titrating, I can find out what happens at 25% of the equivalence point and at the equivalence point itself.

Wait, acetic acid is a weak acid, and NaOH is a strong base. So the titration will involve the reaction of CH3COOH with NaOH to form the acetate ion (CH3COO^-) and water.

First step: Dilution calculation. We have 20.00 cm³ (which is 0.020 L) of 0.05 M acetic acid. When we add 20.00 cm³ of water, the total volume becomes 40.00 cm³ (0.040 L). So the new concentration of acetic acid can be found using M1V1 = M2V2.

M1 is 0.05 M, V1 is 0.020 L. So M2 = (M1V1)/V2 = (0.05 * 0.020) / 0.040. Let me calculate that. 0.05 * 0.02 is 0.001. Divided by 0.04 gives 0.025 M. So the diluted acetic acid is 0.025 M.

Next, when titration starts, the reaction is CH3COOH + NaOH → CH3COO^-Na+ + H2O. So each mole of NaOH neutralizes a mole of acetic acid.

The equivalence point is where moles of NaOH added equal moles of acetic acid initially. Let me compute the initial moles of acetic acid. Original volume after dilution is 0.040 L, concentration 0.025 M. Moles = M * V = 0.025 * 0.040 = 0.001 mol.

Wait, no, wait. Wait, the original solution after dilution is 0.040 L of 0.025 M. So moles of acetic acid are 0.025 * 0.040 = 0.001 mol. Right.

The NaOH solution is 0.1 M. So the volume of NaOH needed to reach equivalence point is moles / M = 0.001 / 0.1 = 0.01 L, which is 10 cm³. Because 0.1 M * 0.01 L = 0.001 moles.

Now, the problem asks for pH at 25% titration and at equivalence point.

Let me tackle each part.

First, 25% titration. That means 25% of the equivalence point volume has been added. So 25% of 10 cm³ is 2.5 cm³ of NaOH added.

Wait, but in titration, the 25% refers to the fraction of the equivalence point reached. So at 25%, we have added 2.5 cm³ of 0.1 M NaOH. Let's calculate the moles of NaOH added: 0.1 M * 0.0025 L = 0.00025 mol.

The initial moles of acetic acid: 0.001 mol. After adding 0.00025 mol of NaOH, some of the acetic acid will have been neutralized to form acetate.

So the reaction is
