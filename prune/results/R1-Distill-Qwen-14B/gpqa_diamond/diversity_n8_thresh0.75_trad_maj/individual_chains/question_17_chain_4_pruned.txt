Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's read the question again to make sure I understand it.

The question is about finding the concentration of calcium ions in a solution that contains a stochiometric Ca-EDTA complex. The given concentration is 0.02 M, and the temperature is 25°C. The formation constant, K_Ca-EDTA, is 5x10^10. The options are from A to D, and I need to pick the right one.

Hmm, so I remember that EDTA forms complexes with metal ions, and the formation constant (Kf) is a measure of the stability of the complex. A higher Kf means the complex is more stable.

The problem states that the solution has a stochiometric Ca-EDTA complex. I think "stochiometric" here means that the ratio of Ca to EDTA is 1:1. So, the complex is CaY²−, where Y is the EDTA^4- ion. 

Wait, but EDTA is usually in its deprotonated form when it complexes with metal ions. Oh right, the problem also says the pH is ideal, so I don't need to worry about the protonation state of EDTA. That's good because otherwise I'd have to consider the different species EDTA can form at different pH levels.

So, the formation of the complex can be written as:
Ca²+ + EDTA^4- ↔ CaEDTA²−, with Kf = 5x10^10.

But wait, sometimes I've seen EDTA represented as H4Y, but when it's deprotonated, it's Y^4-. So in this case, the reaction is correct.

The initial concentration of the complex is 0.02 M. Since the complex dissociates into one Ca²+ and one EDTA^4-, the concentration of free Ca²+ should be equal to the concentration of the complex that dissociates. But wait, no, the solution is of the complex itself, not the individual ions, right?

Let me think. If I have 0.02 M of the Ca-EDTA complex, that means that initially, without considering dissociation, the concentration of Ca²+ would be 0.02 M, and the same for the EDTA^4- (because it's a 1:1 complex). But since the formation constant is large, Kf is 5e
