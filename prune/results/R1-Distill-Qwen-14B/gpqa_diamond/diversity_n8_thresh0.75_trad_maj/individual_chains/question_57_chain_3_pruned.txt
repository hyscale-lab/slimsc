Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about elastic scattering of electrons from a nuclear target. Hmm, I remember that when particles scatter elastically, their kinetic energy is the same after the collision, but their direction changes. The question is about calculating the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude along the incident beam direction.

The given data is the measured phase shifts at different points: δ₀=90°, δ₁=67°, δ₂=55°, δ₃=30°, and δ₄=13°. They also mentioned to ignore the rest of the phase shifts beyond δ₄, so I don't have to worry about higher order terms.

Wait, I think the scattering amplitude in the context of partial waves involves expansion in terms of Legendre polynomials. Oh right, the scattering amplitude f(θ) can be expressed as a sum over l of (something involving the phase shifts δ_l). The general formula I remember is f(θ) = (1/k) * Σ ( (2l+1) * (e^{iδ_l} - 1) * P_l(cosθ) ), where k is the wave number and the sum is from l=0 to some maximum.

But wait, the question specifically asks for the imaginary part along the incident beam. Oh, right, along the incident direction would be θ=0°, because the incident beam is coming in along that direction. So cosθ = 1 for θ=0.

Looking at the Legendre polynomials, P_l(1) is 1 for all l because P_l(1) = 1, since P_0 is 1, P_1 is x, which is 1 here, and so on. Wait, no, actually P_l(1) is always 1 because all Legendre polynomials evaluated at 1 give 1. Because they satisfy P_l(1) = 1 for any l, so yeah.

So each term in the sum will have P_l(1) = 1. So f(θ=0) becomes (1/k) * Σ ( (2l+1) * (e^{iδ_l} - 1) ) for each l from 0 to 4.

But wait, the question is about the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude. So I need to compute the imaginary part of f(0).

Let me think about the expression for f(0). Each term is (2l+1) * (e^{iδ_l} - 1). So the imaginary part of each term is (2
