Alright, so I've got this physics problem in front of me, and I'm trying to figure out how to approach it. The question is about finding the energy of the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) when a certain nucleus is moving at 0.96 times the speed of light. The nucleus in question is X, which is lithium (Li) with 3 neutrons. Hmm, okay, let me break this down.

First, I need to figure out what nucleus X is. Li with 3 neutrons. Wait, lithium normally has an atomic number of 3, right? So the standard lithium isotope is Li-7 because it has 3 protons and 4 neutrons. But here it's Li with 3 neutrons, so that must be Li-6. Because 3 protons plus 3 neutrons would make 6 total nucleons. So the mass number A is 6. Got it.

So the nucleus is Li-6. Now, the problem is about relativistic energy. The speed is given as 0.96c, which is pretty high. I remember that at such speeds, relativistic effects become significant, so I can't just use classical mechanics here. I need to use Einstein's equations.

The question is asking for the energy of the nucleus in the collider. I think that refers to the total relativistic energy, which combines both rest mass energy and kinetic energy. Or wait, sometimes in these contexts, the energy refers to the kinetic energy. Hmm, I need to clarify that.

Wait, the options are all in GeV. The rest mass of a Li-6 nucleus is definitely much less than a GeV. Let me think. The rest mass energy is m*c², and for a single nucleon (proton or neutron), it's about 0.938 GeV. Li-6 has 6 nucleons, so 6 * 0.938 ≈ 5.628 GeV. But the options are way higher than that. So I think the question is asking for the total energy, which includes the kinetic part.

Wait, but maybe not. Wait, no—wait, when a particle is moving at high speed, the total energy is gamma times the rest mass energy. So if the question is about the energy of the collider, which accelerates the nucleus to 0.96c, the energy would be the total relativistic energy, which is gamma multiplied by the rest mass energy.

Alternatively, sometimes in colliders, the energy given is the kinetic energy. But in that case
