Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm not super confident with buffer solutions and the phosphate system. But let's try to think it through.

The question is about finding the concentration of orthophosphate ions (PO4^3-) in a solution. The solution has 200.00 cm³ (which is 0.2 liters) and contains 1.00 g of KH2PO4 and 1.00 g of Na2HPO4·2H2O. The temperatures are at 25°C, and the Ka values for H3PO4 are given as 7.5e-3, 6.2e-8, and 1.8e-12. 

Hmm, I remember that the phosphate buffer system involves these different forms: H3PO4, H2PO4^-, HPO4^2-, and PO4^3-. The various KAs tell us about the acid dissociation steps.

So, the two salts given are KH2PO4 and Na2HPO4·2H2O. KH2PO4 is potassium hydrogen phosphate, which dissociates into K+ and H2PO4^- ions. Na2HPO4·2H2O is sodium hydrogen phosphate dihydrate, which I think dissociates into 2 Na+ and HPO4^2- ions.

Wait, so in the solution, we have a mixture of H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-. This means the solution is a buffer solution because it consists of a weak acid and its conjugate base. Wait, no, wait: H2PO4^- can donate a proton to become HPO4^2-, so H2PO4^- is the acid (HA) and HPO4^2- is the conjugate base (A^-). So the buffer is in the second dissociation step, right? Because H3PO4 → H2PO4^- is first, then H2PO4^- → HPO4^2- is second, and so on.

So the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation would apply here. But wait, the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation is typically used for the first dissociation. Or wait, no—it depends on which step we're considering. Since we're dealing with H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-, the relevant Ka would be the second one, Ka2, which is 6.2e-8.

The Henderson-Hasselbalch equation is pH = pKa + log([base]/[acid]). In this case, the acid is H2PO4^- and the base is HPO4^2-. So [base] is the concentration of HPO4^2-, and [acid] is H2PO4^-.

But wait, the question is about the concentration of orthophosphate ions, which are PO4^3-? Oh wait, no. Orthophosphate is H3PO4, but perhaps I'm mixing terms. Wait, no, I think orthophosphate is PO4^3-, the conjugate base of HPO4^2-.

Wait, no. Let me clarify: phosphoric acid (H3PO4) can lose three protons. The first loss gives H2PO4^- (acid), the second loss gives HPO4^2- (another acid), and the third loss gives PO4^3-.

So in this buffer, we have H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-, which are in equilibrium for the second dissociation: H2PO4^- ↔ HPO4^2- + H+. So the relevant Ka is Ka2, 6.2e-8.

But the question is asking for the concentration of PO4^3- ions. Hmm, that's the third dissociation, right? So PO4^3- is the conjugate base of HPO4^2-.

So to find [PO4^3-], I probably need to consider the third dissociation step. But wait, the solution contains HPO4^2- from Na2HPO4·2H2O, and H2PO4^- from KH2PO4. So the system is a buffer for the second dissociation (H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-), but the PO4^3- comes from the further dissociation of HPO4^2-.

Wait, but given that the solution has both H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-, but the question is about the concentration of PO4^3-, which is the product of the third dissociation. So perhaps
