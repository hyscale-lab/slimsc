The composition results in a piecewise linear function with multiple segments.\n   - \\( x = 4g(f(\\cos(3\\pi y))) \\): Similarly, the cosine function oscillates between -1 and 1, and the absolute value inside \\( f \\) ensures non-negative inputs. The composition also results in a piecewise linear function with multiple segments.\n\n3. **Periodicity and Segments:**\n   - The sine function in \\( y \\) has a period of 1, leading to two \"humps\" in the interval \\( [0, 1] \\).\n   - The cosine function in \\( x \\) has a period of \\( \\tfrac{2}{3} \\), leading to three \"humps\" in the interval \\( [0, 1] \\).\n   - Each \"hump\" contributes multiple linear segments to the overall function due to the absolute value operations in \\( f \\) and \\( g \\).\n\n4. **Intersection Analysis:**\n   - Each function is piecewise linear with multiple segments. The number of intersections is determined by how these segments cross each other within the unit square \\( [0, 1] \\times [0, 1] \\).\n   - Given the periodicity and the structure of the functions, each function has multiple linear segments. The total number of intersections is the product of the number of segments of each function.\n\n5. **Conclusion:**\n   - After considering the periodicity, symmetry, and the number of segments in each function, the total number of intersections is determined to be **16**.\n\n\\boxed{16}"
