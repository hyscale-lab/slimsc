Each vertex is colored red or blue independently with equal probability.\n\nTo solve this, we analyze the rotations of the octagon and the conditions under which the blue vertices (B) can be shifted to positions that were originally red (R). This requires that B and \u03c3_k(B) are disjoint for some rotation \u03c3_k. The number of such subsets B is computed using combinatorial methods and group theory, considering the cycle structures of the rotations.\n\nAfter careful consideration and analysis, the number of favorable subsets is determined to be 73. The probability is thus 73/256, where 256 is the total number of possible colorings. Summing the numerator and denominator gives 73 + 256 = 329.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{329}"
