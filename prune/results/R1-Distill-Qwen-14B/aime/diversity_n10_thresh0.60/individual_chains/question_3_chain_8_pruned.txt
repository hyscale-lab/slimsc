Okay, so I've got this probability problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again to make sure I understand what's being asked.

Jen enters a lottery by picking 4 distinct numbers from the set S = {1,2,3,...,9,10}. Then, 4 numbers are randomly chosen from S. She wins a prize if at least two of her numbers are among the randomly chosen numbers. She wins the grand prize if all four of her numbers are the ones chosen. The question is asking for the probability that she won the grand prize given that she won a prize. This probability is expressed as a fraction m/n, where m and n are coprime positive integers, and we need to find m + n.

Alright, so this is a conditional probability problem. The formula for conditional probability is P(A|B) = P(A ∩ B) / P(B), but in this case, if A is winning the grand prize, then A is a subset of B, since winning the grand prize automatically means she won a prize. So P(A ∩ B) is just P(A). So the formula simplifies to P(A|B) = P(A) / P(B).

So I need to find P(A), which is the probability that Jen wins the grand prize, and P(B), the probability that she wins at least two numbers, i.e., a prize.

Let me structure this:

1. Calculate the total number of possible ways to choose 4 numbers from S. Since S has 10 numbers, the total number of possible combinations is C(10,4). I can compute this as 10 choose 4.

2. Calculate P(A): the probability that all four of her numbers are chosen. So this is the number of favorable outcomes (which is 1, since she picked a specific set of four numbers) divided by the total number of possible outcomes. So P(A) = 1 / C(10,4).

3. Calculate P(B): the probability that at least two of her numbers are chosen. This can be calculated using complementary probability, that is, 1 minus the probability that fewer than two numbers are chosen. So P(B) = 1 - [P(0 correct) + P(1 correct)].

Alternatively, I can calculate P(B) directly by summing the probabilities of having exactly 2, 3, or 4 correct numbers.

Wait, actually, since the problem states that she wins a prize if at least two are chosen, which includes exactly 2, exactly 3, and exactly 4. So P(B) is the sum of the probabilities of these three scenarios.

So let's approach it that way.

First, let's compute the total number of ways to choose 4 numbers from 10: C(10,4). Let me compute that.

C(10,4) = 10! / (4! * (10-4)!) = (10*9*8*7) / (4*3*2*1) = 210.

So the total number of possible combinations is 210.

Now, P(A) is 1 / 210, since there's only one way to choose exactly her four numbers.

Next, P(B): the probability she wins a prize, which is the probability that at least two of her four numbers are chosen.

To compute this, I need to find the number of favorable outcomes where exactly 2, exactly 3, or exactly 4 of her numbers are among the chosen four.

Let me compute each case separately.

Case 1: Exactly 2 of her numbers are chosen.

The number of ways to choose exactly 2 correct numbers from her 4 is C(4,2). Then, the remaining 2 numbers must be chosen from the 6 numbers she did not pick (since there are 10 - 4 = 6 numbers she didn't choose). So the number of ways for this case is C(4,2) * C(6,2).

Case 2: Exactly 3 of her numbers are chosen.

Similarly, the number of ways here is C(4,3) * C(6,1), since we choose 3 correct from her 4, and 1 incorrect from the remaining 6.

Case 3: Exactly 4 of her numbers are chosen.

This is the case where she wins the grand prize, which we've already considered. The number of ways is C(4,4) * C(6,0) = 1 * 1 = 1.

So now, let's compute each case:

Case 1: C(4,2) * C(6,2) = (6) * (15) = 90.

Wait, let's compute step by step.

C(4,2) is 6. C(6,2) is (6
