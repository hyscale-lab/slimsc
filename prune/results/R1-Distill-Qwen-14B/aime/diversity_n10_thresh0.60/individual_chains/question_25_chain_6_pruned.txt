Okay, so I have this problem about the residents of Aimeville and the things they own. Let me try to break it down step by step. 

First, let me list out all the given information. There are 900 residents in total. Each resident owns a bag of candy hearts, but that's a given for everyone. Then, some own a diamond ring, some own a set of golf clubs, and some own a garden spade. 

The numbers are as follows:
- Diamond ring owners: 195
- Golf clubs owners: 367
- Garden spade owners: 562

Additionally, it's mentioned that each of the 900 residents owns a bag of candy hearts. So, that's like a fourth item everyone has. 

Now, the problem also gives some information about how many people own exactly two or exactly three of these items. Specifically:
- 437 residents own exactly two of these things.
- 234 residents own exactly three of these things.

And the question is asking for the number of residents who own all four of these things. So, we're looking for the number of people who have a diamond ring, golf clubs, garden spade, and candy hearts. 

Hmm, okay. This sounds like a problem that involves the principle of inclusion-exclusion. I remember that inclusion-exclusion helps in calculating the number of elements in the union of multiple sets by adding up the sizes of individual sets and then subtracting the sizes of all possible intersections, and so on, alternating between addition and subtraction as needed.

But wait, in this case, we have four sets: let's denote them as D (diamond ring), G (golf clubs), S (spade), and C (candy hearts). But everyone owns C, so C is the universal set here, right? Because every resident has at least a candy heart. So, the total number of people is the same as the number of people in C, which is 900.

So, the four sets are D, G, S, and C, with C being the universal set. 

The problem is to find the number of people who own all four, which is |D ∩ G ∩ S ∩ C|. Since C is the universal set, this is just |D ∩ G ∩ S|. So, perhaps that's the number we're looking for.

But wait, the problem says each resident owns a bag of candy hearts, so C is 900. So, when we talk about someone owning all four, it's the same as them owning D, G, S, and C, but since C is always there, it's just D, G, and S. So, the number of people who own all four is the same as those who own all three of D, G, S.

Hmm, that makes sense. So, perhaps the problem reduces to finding the number of people who own D, G, and S.

But how do we get there? Let me think about the inclusion-exclusion formula. For three sets, the formula for the union is:

|D ∪ G ∪ S| = |D| + |G| + |S| - |D ∩ G| - |D ∩ S| - |G ∩ S|
