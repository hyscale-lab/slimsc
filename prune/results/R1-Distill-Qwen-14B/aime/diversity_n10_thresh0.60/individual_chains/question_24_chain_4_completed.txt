Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the sum of the squares of all the items in a list of positive integers. The list has some specific properties, and I need to figure out what the numbers are first.

Let me list out the given properties again to make sure I don't miss anything:

1. The sum of the items is 30.
2. The unique mode is 9.
3. The median is a positive integer that doesn't appear in the list.

Hmm, okay. Let's break this down step by step.

First, the mode is 9, and it's unique. That means 9 appears more frequently in the list than any other number, and no other number has the same frequency as 9. So, 9 has to occur at least twice, but more than any other number. So if another number appears twice, 9 must appear at least three times. Wait, no, actually, the mode is unique, so 9 must appear more times than any other number. So if another number appears, say, three times, 9 has to appear at least four times. But let's think about the minimal case where 9 is the mode.

So, let's say 9 appears twice. Then, every other number can appear at most once, because if any other number appears twice, it would tie with 9, making the mode not unique. Therefore, to have a unique mode, 9 must appear more times than any other number. So if 9 appears twice, others can appear at most once. Alternatively, if 9 appears three times, others can appear at most two times, but since 9 has more, it's still the mode.

Wait, but since the mode is unique, 9 must have a higher frequency than any other number in the list. So, if 9 appears k times, other numbers can appear at most k-1 times.

So, let's think about the minimal number of elements required. Let's try to make the list as small as possible to satisfy the sum.

Wait, but the median is a positive integer that does not appear in the list. That's interesting. The median is the middle value when the numbers are arranged in order. So, if the list has an odd number of elements, the median is the middle one. If even, it's the average of the two middle numbers.

But the median itself is a positive integer not in the list. So, for example, if the list has an odd number of elements, the median is the middle number, which is not present in the list. But that's impossible because in an odd-length list, the median is one of the elements. Unless... wait, no. If the list has an even number of elements, the median would be the average of the two middle numbers, which could potentially be an integer not present in the list.

Wait, for example, if the two middle numbers are 8 and 10. Their average is 9, which is an integer. So if 9 isn't in the list, that works. But in that case, 9 would be the median but not present in the list. So, that could satisfy the third condition.

So, the list must have an even number of elements because if it's odd, the median is in the list, which violates the third condition. So, the number of elements in the list is even.

Let me denote the number of elements as n, which is even. So n is even, n ≥ 2.

Let me think about the minimal case where the list is as small as possible. Let's see: to minimize the number of elements, but given the constraints.

Wait, but 9 is the mode, so it must appear more times than any other number. So, let's say n is 8. Let's see if that's possible.

Wait, let's think about the sum first. The sum is 30. So, the list consists of positive integers, and their sum is 30. The mode is 9, which appears more times than any other number.

So, let's consider the minimal number of 9s required. Let me try n=8.

If n=8, the sum is 30. Let me see: 8 numbers, some of them 9s, some others.

Let me consider how many 9s we can have. Let's say we have three 9s. Then, the total sum contributed by the 9s is 27. The remaining sum is 30-27=3, which needs to be distributed among 5 other numbers. Each of these numbers must be positive integers, different from 9, and each can appear at most twice (since 3 is the number of 9s, others can appear at most two times to not exceed the mode).

Wait, but if we have three 9s, then each other number can appear at most two times.

But in a list of 8 numbers, if we have three 9s, the remaining five numbers must be filled with numbers other than 9. Let's see if that can sum to 3.

Wait, the remaining sum after three 9s is 3. So, the other five numbers must add up to 3, and each is a positive integer. The minimal sum for five positive integers is 5 (each being 1). But 5 is more than 3, which is impossible. So, n=8 is not possible.

Alternatively, perhaps n is larger.

Wait, let's try n=10.

Wait, wait, let's think again. Maybe n=6.

Wait, perhaps n=6. Let me see.

If n=6, which is even, the median would be the average of the 3rd and 4th numbers. So, the median is (a3 + a4)/2. For this to be an integer, a3 and a4 must be both even or both odd. Also, the median is not present in the list.

So, let's try n=6.

Sum is 30. Let's assume 9 is the mode, so it appears more times than any other number.

Let me see: how many 9s do we need? Let's try with three 9s.

Three 9s contribute 27 to the sum. Remaining sum is 3, which needs to be distributed among 3 numbers. Because 6-3=3 numbers left. So, each of these three numbers must be 1, since 1+1+1=3. So, the list would be [1,1,1,9,9,9]. Let's check the properties.

Sum: 1+1+1+9+9+9=30. Good.

Mode: 9 appears three times, others appear once. So, unique mode is 9. Good.

Median: For n=6, the median is the average of the 3rd and 4th terms. The list ordered would be [1,1,1,9,9,9]. So, 3rd term is 1, 4th term is 9. Average is (1+9)/2=5. So, median is 5, which is a positive integer not present in the list. Perfect.

So, this list satisfies all the conditions.

So, the list is [1,1,1,9,9,9]. Let me check again.

Sum: 1*3 + 9*3 = 3 +27=30. Correct.

Mode: 9 appears three times, others appear three times as 1. Wait, wait, the numbers are [1,1,1,9,9,9]. So, 1 appears three times, 9 appears three times. So, both 1 and 9 appear three times. That would make them both modes, which contradicts the unique mode condition.

Oh no, that's a problem. Because in this case, both 1 and 9 are modes, each appearing three times. So, the mode is not unique. Therefore, this list doesn't satisfy the second condition.

So, I need to adjust the number of 9s so that 9 appears more times than any other number.

So, let's try four 9s. Then, the sum from 9s is 4*9=36, which is already more than 30, so that's impossible. So, four 9s is too much.

So, three 9s gives us sum 27, remaining sum 3. But that requires three 1s, which leads to a tie for mode. So that's not acceptable.

Alternative approach: Maybe have more 9s but fewer other numbers.

Wait, but we can't have four 9s because that's 36 >30.

So, perhaps n=8.

Let me try n=8.

We need to have 9 as the mode, appearing more times than any other number.

So, how many 9s? Let's say four 9s. That would be 4*9=36 >30, which is too much. So, can't.

Three 9s: 3*9=27. Remaining sum is 3, which has to be distributed over 5 numbers. Each of these 5 numbers is a positive integer, and each can be at most two, because if any of them appears three times, it would tie with 9's three times, which would make the mode not unique.

Wait, but three 9s, others can appear at most two times.

So, let me try to make the remaining five numbers with sum 3, each at most two.

But the minimal sum for five positive integers is 5 (each 1), which is more than 3. So, impossible.

So, n=8 is not feasible.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake. Let's see: n=8, three 9s, sum 27. Remaining sum is 3, which needs to be spread over 5 numbers.

Wait, 5 numbers adding up to 3, each at least 1. So, possible only if three of them are 1 and the other two are 0, but no, numbers must be positive integers. So, can't have zeros. So, impossible.

So, n=8 is not possible.

Wait, maybe n=10.

Let me try n=10.

Sum is 30.

We need mode 9, which appears more than any other number.

Let me try with three 9s: 3*9=27. Remaining sum is 3, to be distributed over 7 numbers. Each of these 7 numbers must be 1, because 7*1=7, but 7 >3, which is not possible. So, that doesn't work.

Wait, with three 9s, the remaining 7 numbers need to sum to 3. Each is at least 1, so minimal sum is 7, which is more than 3. Not possible.

So, can't have three 9s.

Wait, perhaps more 9s. Let's try four 9s: 4*9=36 >30. No.

So, can't have four 9s.

Hmm, maybe I need to have more 9s but adjust the other numbers to have a lower sum.

Wait, perhaps with two 9s.

Wait, two 9s: sum 18. Remaining sum is 12, over 8 numbers.

Wait, but if 9 appears twice, then other numbers can appear at most once, because 9 is the unique mode.

Wait, but two 9s: other numbers can appear at most once. So, in n=10, 2 9s and 8 other numbers, each appearing once. Sum of 9s is 18. Sum of others is 12, with 8 distinct numbers (since each can appear only once). So, the sum of 8 distinct positive integers is 12.

What's the minimal sum for 8 distinct positive integers? It's 1+2+3+4+5+6+7+8=36, which is way more than 12. So, impossible.

So, n=10 is not feasible with two 9s.

Hmm, perhaps n=12.

Wait, let's try n=12.

Sum is 30.

Let me try three 9s: 27. Remaining sum is 3, over 9 numbers.

Each of these 9 numbers must be at least 1, so minimal sum is 9, which is more than 3. Impossible.

Alternatively, four 9s: 36 >30, no.

Hmm, maybe I'm approaching this wrong. Maybe the number of 9s isn't the main issue. Let's think differently.

Wait, the median is a positive integer not present in the list. So, for even n, the median is (a_{n/2} + a_{n/2 +1}) /2. This median must be an integer not in the list.

So, to make this median an integer, the two middle numbers must be either both even or both odd. And their average is an integer not present.

So, perhaps the two middle numbers are such that their average is an integer not in the list.

Let me think about the list structure.

Suppose the list has n elements, even. Let me try n=6 again.

Wait, n=6, sum=30. Let's have four 9s: 4*9=36>30, no. Three 9s: 27, remaining sum 3 over 3 numbers. Each of those numbers must be 1, but that causes mode conflict.

Alternatively, maybe have four 9s, but that's too much.

Wait, perhaps the list has two 9s, but that would require other numbers to appear only once. Let me see.

Wait, n=6, two 9s: sum 18. Remaining sum 12 over 4 numbers. Each can be at most once. So, the four numbers would have to be four distinct numbers adding up to 12.

What's the minimal sum for four distinct positive integers? 1+2+3+4=10. So, 10 is the minimal sum. 12 is possible, e.g., 1,2,3,6 or 1,2,4,5.

So, let's try that.

List would be [1,2,3,6,9,9]. Let's check.

Sum: 1+2+3+6+9+9=30. Good.

Mode: 9 appears twice, others appear once. So, mode is 9, unique. Good.

Median: For n=6, the median is (3rd +4th)/2. The list ordered is [1,2,3,6,9,9]. So, 3rd is 3, 4th is 6. Median is (3+6)/2=4.5, which is not an integer. So, that doesn't satisfy the condition.

So, we need the median to be an integer. Therefore, the two middle numbers must be both even or both odd.

So, let's try to arrange the list such that the two middle numbers are both even or both odd.

Let me try another combination.

Suppose the two middle numbers are both even, say 4 and 4. But 4 can't appear more than once because 9 is the mode. Wait, no. If 9 appears twice, others can appear at most once. So, 4 can appear only once.

Wait, perhaps the two middle numbers are 5 and 5. But again, 5 can appear only once. So, that's not possible.

Alternatively, the two middle numbers could be 2 and 6, which are both even. Let's see.

So, to get the two middle numbers as 2 and 6, the list would be [a, b, 2, 6, c, d], where a, b, c, d are arranged in order.

Wait, but I'm getting confused. Maybe I should construct the list step by step.

Let me try to have n=6, sum=30, mode=9, median integer not in list.

So, to have the median as an integer, the two middle numbers must be both even or both odd.

Let me try to have the two middle numbers as 5 and 5. But 5 can only appear once because mode is 9. So, can't have two 5s.

Alternatively, 4 and 6. Both even. So, their average is 5, which is an integer not present in the list.

So, let's try to have the two middle numbers as 4 and 6.

So, the list would be: [a, b, 4,6,c,d], with a ≤ b ≤4 ≤6 ≤c ≤d.

But wait, n=6, so the list is of six numbers. Let me structure it as:

positions 1,2,3,4,5,6.

We need the 3rd and 4th numbers to be 4 and 6.

So, the third number is 4, fourth is 6.

So, the first three numbers must be ≤4, and the last two must be ≥6.

Now, the sum is 30.

Let me assign variables:

a, b, c, 4,6,d.

Wait, no, the first three are a, b, c, then 4,6,d.

Wait, no, the list is ordered: a ≤ b ≤ c ≤4 ≤6 ≤d.

Wait, no, because position 3 is 4, position 4 is 6. So, a ≤ b ≤ c=4, and 6 ≤ d.

Wait, but 4 is the third number, so a, b ≤4, and the fourth is 6, so c=4, d≥6.

Wait, I'm getting a bit tangled. Let me think differently.

The list is ordered: a₁ ≤ a₂ ≤ a₃ ≤ a₄ ≤ a₅ ≤ a₆.

We have a₃=4, a₄=6.

So, a₁ ≤ a₂ ≤4, and 6 ≤ a₅ ≤a₆.

Sum is a₁ +a₂ +4 +6 +a₅ +a₆ =30.

So, a₁ +a₂ +a₅ +a₆ =30 - (4+6)=18.

We also know that 9 is the mode, appearing more times than any other number.

So, how many 9s do we have? Let's see.

If we have two 9s, then other numbers can appear at most once.

So, if two 9s are in a₅ and a₆, then a₅=9 and a₆=9. Because a₅ and a₆ are the last two numbers, which must be ≥6.

So, let's set a₅=9, a₆=9.

Then, the sum becomes a₁ +a₂ +4 +6 +9 +9 =30. Let's check: 4+6=10, 9+9=18, so 10+18=28, and a₁ +a₂=2. Since a₁ and a₂ are positive integers, the only possibility is a₁=1, a₂=1.

So, the list would be [1,1,4,6,9,9].

Let's check the properties:

Sum:1+1+4+6+9+9=30. Correct.

Mode: 9 appears twice. 1 appears twice. 4 and 6 appear once. So, both 1 and 9 appear twice, which would make them both modes. But the mode is supposed to be unique. So, this is a problem.

So, mode is not unique. Therefore, this list doesn't work.

Hmm, so I need 9 to appear more times than any other number. So, if I have three 9s, that would make 9 appear three times. Then, other numbers can appear at most two times.

But in this case, a₅ and a₆ are 9, and if a₁ or a₂ is 9, but that would require a₁ or a₂ to be 9, which is larger than 4, which is not possible because a₃=4.

Wait, a₁ and a₂ must be ≤4. So, they can't be 9. So, the only 9s are a₅ and a₆. So, only two 9s. Which causes the mode to be shared with 1 if a₁ and a₂ are 1.

So, perhaps I need to have a different arrangement.

Let me try with a₅=9 and a₆=9, but a₁ and a₂ are not both 1.

Wait, but the sum a₁ +a₂=2, so they have to be 1 and 1. No other option.

So, in that case, 1 appears twice, 9 appears twice. Mode is not unique.

So, to make 9 the unique mode, 9 must appear more times than any other number.

So, perhaps, in this case, 9 must appear three times.

But how? Because in n=6, to have three 9s, the sum would be 27, leaving 3 for the other three numbers. So, 3 numbers adding up to 3, each at least 1. So, 1,1,1.

So, the list would be [1,1,1,9,9,9].

As I thought earlier, but this leads to both 1 and 9 appearing three times, making them both modes. So, that's not allowed.

So, perhaps n=6 isn't possible.

Wait, maybe I need to have n=8.

Let me try n=8.

Sum is 30. Let's try with four 9s: 4*9=36>30. No.

Three 9s: 27. Remaining sum is 3, to be distributed over 5 numbers.

Each of these 5 numbers must be 1, but 5*1=5>3. Not possible.

So, can't have three 9s.

Wait, maybe two 9s.

Two 9s: 18. Remaining sum is 12 over 6 numbers.

Each of these 6 numbers can be at most once, because 9 is the mode. So, six distinct numbers adding up to 12.

What's the minimal sum for six distinct positive integers? 1+2+3+4+5+6=21>12. So, impossible.

So, n=8 is not feasible.

Hmm, perhaps n=10.

Wait, let's try n=10.

Sum is 30.

Let me try with three 9s: 27. Remaining sum 3 over 7 numbers.

Each of these 7 numbers must be 1, but 7*1=7>3. Not possible.

So, can't have three 9s.

Wait, maybe two 9s: 18. Remaining sum 12 over 8 numbers.

Each of these 8 numbers must be at most once, so eight distinct numbers adding up to 12.

Minimal sum for eight distinct positive integers is 1+2+3+4+5+6+7+8=36>12. So, impossible.

Hmm, perhaps I need to have more 9s, but that's not possible due to sum constraints.

Wait, maybe I need to have n=5? But wait, n must be even because the median is an integer not present. For odd n, the median is one of the elements, which would violate the condition. So, n must be even.

Wait, maybe n=4.

Let me try n=4.

Sum is 30.

Wait, four numbers adding up to 30. That would require numbers averaging 7.5, which is possible.

But let's see.

We need the mode to be 9, unique.

So, 9 must appear more times than any other number.

So, in four numbers, 9 can appear at least twice.

Let me try with three 9s: 27. Remaining number is 3. So, the list would be [3,9,9,9].

Sum:3+9+9+9=30. Correct.

Mode: 9 appears three times, 3 appears once. So, mode is 9, unique. Good.

Median: For n=4, the median is the average of the 2nd and 3rd numbers. The list is [3,9,9,9]. So, 2nd=9, 3rd=9. Average is 9, which is in the list. So, violates the condition that median is not in the list.

So, that's no good.

Alternatively, let's have two 9s: [a, b,9,9]. Sum is a + b + 18=30 → a + b=12.

We need mode 9, unique. So, a and b can't be 9, and they can appear at most once.

So, a and b are distinct numbers, each ≤9.

So, possible pairs: (3,9) but 9 is already in the list as mode. Wait, but 9 is already appearing twice, so a and b can't be 9 because that would make 9 appear three times, but perhaps if a and b are both 6, but then 6 would appear twice, which would tie with 9, making mode not unique.

Wait, no. If 9 appears twice, and a and b are the same number, say x, then x appears twice as well. So, modes would be 9 and x, which is not allowed.

So, a and b must be distinct numbers, each appearing once.

So, a and b must be different, and not 9.

So, their sum is 12.

Possible pairs: (1,11) but 11 is larger than 9, but allowed since numbers can be any positive integer. But in the list, the numbers are [a, b,9,9], ordered as [a, b,9,9]. So, a and b must be ≤9.

Wait, a and b are positive integers, but their sum is 12, and each ≤9.

So, possible pairs:

(3,9) but 9 can't be used because 9 is already in the list, and adding another 9 would make 9 appear three times, which is okay, but then x=9 appears three times, which would be the mode, but then we have two 9s already. Wait, no, in this case, the list would be [3,9,9,9], which we already considered, and the median is 9, which is in the list.

Alternatively, (4,8): sum 12. So, list becomes [4,8,9,9]. Let's check.

Sum:4+8+9+9=30. Correct.

Mode: 9 appears twice, others appear once. So, mode is 9, unique. Good.

Median: For n=4, median is average of 2nd and 3rd terms. Ordered list: [4,8,9,9]. So, 2nd=8, 3rd=9. Average is (8+9)/2=8.5, which is not an integer. So, doesn't satisfy the condition.

Alternatively, another pair: (5,7). Sum 12.

List: [5,7,9,9]. Sum:5+7+9+9=30.

Mode: 9 appears twice, others once. Good.

Median: (7+9)/2=8, which is an integer. Is 8 present in the list? The list is [5,7,9,9]. 8 is not present. So, this satisfies all conditions.

Wait, that's promising.

So, the list is [5,7,9,9]. Let's check:

Sum:5+7+9+9=30. Correct.

Mode:9 appears twice, others once. Unique mode. Correct.

Median: (7+9)/2=8, which is not in the list. Correct.

So, this list satisfies all the conditions.

So, the numbers are 5,7,9,9.

Now, the question is to find the sum of the squares of all the items in the list.

So, compute 5² +7² +9² +9².

Calculating:

5²=25

7²=49

9²=81

So, sum is 25 +49 +81 +81.

Let's add them up:

25 +49=74

74 +81=155

155 +81=236

So, the sum of the squares is 236.

Wait, but let me double-check the list.

List:5,7,9,9.

Sum:5+7=12, 9+9=18. 12+18=30. Correct.

Mode:9 appears twice, others once. Correct.

Median: (7+9)/2=8, not in the list. Correct.

So, yes, this list works, and the sum of squares is 236.


To solve the problem, we need to find a list of positive integers that satisfies the given conditions and then compute the sum of the squares of its elements.

### Conditions:
1. The sum of the list is 30.
2. The unique mode is 9.
3. The median is a positive integer not present in the list.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Mode Condition**: The mode is 9, which must appear more frequently than any other number. This implies that 9 must appear at least twice, and no other number can appear the same number of times as 9.
   
2. **Median Condition**: The median must be an integer not present in the list. For an even-length list, the median is the average of the two middle numbers. Therefore, these two middle numbers must either both be even or both be odd to yield an integer median that is not in the list.

3. **Sum Condition**: The total sum of the list must be 30.

### Constructing the List:
- Let’s try a list with **4 elements** since it’s the smallest even number that allows a median not present in the list.
- To satisfy the mode condition, 9 must appear at least twice.
- Let’s attempt the list `[5, 7, 9, 9]`:
  - **Sum**: \(5 + 7 + 9 + 9 = 30\), which satisfies the sum condition.
  - **Mode**: 9 appears twice, while 5 and 7 appear once. Thus, 9 is the unique mode.
  - **Median**: For an even-length list, the median is the average of the 2nd and 3rd elements. Here, the 2nd element is 7, and the 3rd element is 9. The median is \((7 + 9) / 2 = 8\), which is an integer not present in the list.

### Sum of Squares:
Compute the sum of the squares of the elements in the list:
\[
5^2 + 7^2 + 9^2 + 9^2 = 25 + 49 + 81 + 81 = 236
\]

### Final Answer:
The sum of the squares of all the items in the list is \(\boxed{236}\).
