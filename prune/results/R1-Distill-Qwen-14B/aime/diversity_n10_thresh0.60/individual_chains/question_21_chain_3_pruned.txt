Okay, so I came across this math problem, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's try to understand what it's asking for.

The problem is about something called "b-eautiful" numbers. The definition is a bit specific, so I need to parse it properly. Let me read it again.

"A positive integer n is b-eautiful if it has exactly two digits when expressed in base b, and these two digits sum to sqrt(n)."

So, n is a two-digit number in base b. That means, in base 10, n is equal to a*b + c, where a and c are the digits. And the sum of these two digits, a + c, should equal the square root of n.

They gave an example: 81 is 13-eautiful because 81 = 6*13 + 3, which is 6 and 3 in base 13, and 6 + 3 equals 9, which is sqrt(81). That makes sense.

The task is to find the least integer b (where b is at least 2) such that there are more than ten b-eautiful integers. So, for each base b, we need to count how many numbers n satisfy that condition, and find the smallest b where this count exceeds ten.

Alright, let's break this down.

First, let's model the problem mathematically.

In base b, a two-digit number is written as 'ac' where a is the first digit and c is the second. So, in base 10, this number is equal to a*b + c.

The condition is that a + c = sqrt(n). Since n is a*b + c, we can write:

a + c = sqrt(a*b + c)

Let me square both sides to eliminate the square root:

(a + c)^2 = a*b + c

Expanding the left side:

a^2 + 2ac + c^2 = a*b + c

Let me rearrange this equation to group terms:

a^2 + 2ac + c^2 - a*b - c = 0

Hmm, that's a quadratic in terms of a and c, but both a and c are digits in base b, so their possible values are limited. Specifically, a can range from 1 to b-1 (since it's the first digit of a two-digit number) and c can range from 0 to b-1.

Maybe it's better to express this equation in a way that isolates b. Let's try that.

From the equation:

a^2 + 2ac + c^2 - a*b - c = 0

We can solve for b:

a*b = a^2 + 2ac + c^2 - c

So,

b = (a^2 + 2ac + c^2 - c) / a

Simplify the numerator:

a^2 + 2ac + c^2 - c = a^2 + 2ac + c(c - 1)

Hmm, not sure if that helps.

Alternatively, factor where possible.

Wait, let me think differently. Let's express the equation as:

b = (a^2 + 2ac + c^2 - c) / a

We can simplify this:

b = a + 2c + (c^2 - c)/a

Hmm, but since b has to be an integer, the term (c^2 - c) must be divisible by a.

So, (c^2 - c) must be divisible by a.

That's an interesting point. So, for given a and c, (c^2 - c) must be a multiple of a.

Alternatively, a must divide (c^2 - c). So, a | c(c - 1).

Since a and c are digits in base b, a is between 1 and b-1, and c is between 0 and b-1.

Also, remember that n = a*b + c must be a perfect square because sqrt(n) is an integer (since a + c is an integer). So, n is a perfect square, and a + c is its square root.

Let me think about the possible values of a and c.

Since a is the first digit, it can't be zero, so a â‰¥ 1. c can be zero, though.

Wait, but if c is zero, then a + c = a, and n = a*b + 0 = a*b. So, a must equal sqrt(a*b). Squaring both sides, a^2 = a*b, so a = b. But since a is a digit in base b, a must be less than b. So, a can't be equal to b. Therefore, c cannot be zero because that would require a = b, which is impossible. So, c must be at least 1.

So, c ranges from
