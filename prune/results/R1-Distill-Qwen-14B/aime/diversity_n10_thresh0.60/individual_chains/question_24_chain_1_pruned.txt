Okay, so I've got this math problem here, and I need to figure out the sum of the squares of all the items in the list. Let me read the problem again to make sure I understand all the conditions.

The problem states:

A list of positive integers has the following properties:

1. The sum of the items in the list is 30.
2. The unique mode of the list is 9.
3. The median of the list is a positive integer that does not appear in the list itself.

We need to find the sum of the squares of all the items in the list.

Alright, let's break this down step by step.

First, let's recall what each term means:

- **Sum of the items**: The total when all numbers are added together. So, the sum is 30.
- **Mode**: The number that appears most frequently in the list. It's unique, so only 9 can be the mode, and it appears more times than any other number.
- **Median**: The middle number when the list is ordered from smallest to largest. If there's an even number of elements, the median is the average of the two middle numbers. But in this case, the median is a positive integer that doesn't appear in the list. That's interesting because usually, the median is one of the numbers in the list, especially if the list has an odd number of elements. But here, it's an integer not present, which suggests perhaps the list has an even number of elements, so the median is the average of two numbers, neither of which is the median itself.

So, our task is to reconstruct a list of positive integers that satisfies these conditions and then compute the sum of their squares.

Let me start by considering the mode condition. Since the mode is 9 and it's unique, 9 must appear more times than any other number. So, if I denote the number of times 9 appears as 'k', then all other numbers can appear at most 'k-1' times.

Next, the sum is 30. So, if I have multiple 9s, the sum contributed by them is 9 * k. The remaining sum is 30 - 9k, which must be made up by other numbers.

Then, the median must be an integer not present in the list. Let's think about how the median is determined. For a list with n elements:

- If n is odd, the median is the ((n+1)/2)th element. Since the median isn't in the list, the ((n+1)/2)th element must be an integer not present. That's tricky because the list is ordered, so that position is filled by some number, but that number is the median, which is not in the list. Hmm, that's confusing because if n is odd, the middle element is part of the list. So, maybe n is even?

Wait, wait. Let me think. If n is even, the median is the average of the (n/2)th and (n/2 +1)th elements. If the average is an integer not present in the list, that means the two middle numbers must average to an integer, but neither of them is equal to that integer. So, for example, if the two middle numbers are 8 and 10, their average is 9, which is an integer not present in the list (since the mode is 9, but wait, 9 is in the list as the mode. Hmm, that's a conflict because if the two middle numbers are 8 and 10, their average is 9, but 9 is in the list as the mode. So, the median would be 9, but 9 is already present in the list. That can't be, because the problem says the median is a positive integer that does not appear in the list. So, that's a problem.

Wait, so maybe n is odd? Let's try that. If n is odd, the median is the middle number, which is part of the list. But the problem says the median is not in the list. That can't happen if n is odd because the median is the middle element, which must be in the list. So, n can't be odd. Therefore, n must be even, because only then the median is the average of two numbers, which may not be present.

So, n is even, and the median is the average of the two middle numbers, which is an integer not present in the list.

But wait, since 9 is the mode, it must appear more frequently than any other number. So, perhaps the two middle numbers are such that their average is 9, which is the mode, but the two middle numbers themselves are not 9. That way, 9 is the mode because it appears more times than any other number, but the median is 9, which is not present in the list. Wait, but that's a contradiction because the two middle numbers are 8 and 10, which average to 9. Then 9 is not
