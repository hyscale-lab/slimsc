Okay, so I have this problem here, and I need to find the greatest four-digit number N such that if any one of its digits is changed to 1, the resulting number is divisible by 7. Then, I need to find Q + R where Q is the quotient and R is the remainder when N is divided by 1000.

Hmm, let me start by understanding the problem. N is a four-digit number, so it's between 1000 and 9999. When any single digit is replaced by 1, the new number must be divisible by 7. That means, for example, if I change the thousands digit to 1, the number should be divisible by 7. Similarly for changing the hundreds, tens, or units digits.

My goal is to find the largest such N. So maybe I can approach this by considering what constraints the divisibility by 7 imposes when each digit is changed to 1.

Let me denote N as a four-digit number with digits A, B, C, D. So N = ABCD, which is equal to 1000*A + 100*B + 10*C + D.

Now, if I change each digit one by one to 1 and check divisibility by 7, that gives me four conditions:

1. Changing A to 1: The number becomes 1BCD. So, 1000 + 100*B + 10*C + D must be divisible by 7.
2. Changing B to 1: The number becomes A1CD. So, 1000*A + 100 + 10*C + D must be divisible by 7.
3. Changing C to 1: The number becomes AB1D. So, 1000*A + 100*B + 10 + D must be divisible by 7.
4. Changing D to 1: The number becomes ABC1. So, 1000*A + 100*B + 10*C + 1 must be divisible by 7.

So each of these four modified numbers must be divisible by 7.

I think I can express each condition in terms of N and the digit being changed. Let me try that.

First, original number N = ABCD.

When I change A to 1: The new number is 1BCD = 1000 + 100B + 10C + D. Let me denote this as N1.

Similarly, N2 = A1CD = 1000*A + 100*1 + 10C + D.

N3 = AB1D = 1000*A + 100B + 10*1 + D.

N4 = ABC1 = 1000*A + 100B + 10C + 1.

Each of these N1, N2, N3, N4 must be divisible by 7.

I can write these as:

N1 ≡ 0 mod 7

N2 ≡ 0 mod 7

N3 ≡ 0 mod 7

N4 ≡ 0 mod 7

But since N is ABCD, which is 1000A + 100B + 10C + D, perhaps I can express each modified number in terms of N minus the original digit plus the new digit (which is 1).

For example:

N1 = 1000*1 + 100B + 10C + D = 1000 + (N - 1000A). So N1 = N - 1000A + 1000.

Similarly, N2 = 1000A + 100*1 + 10C + D = N - 100B + 100.

N3 = 1000A + 100B + 10*1 + D = N - 10C + 10.

N4 = 1000A + 100B + 10C + 1 = N - D + 1.

So each of these can be written as:

N1 = N - 1000A + 1000

N2 = N - 100B + 100

N3 = N - 10C + 10

N4 = N - D + 1

Since each N1, N2, N3, N4 must be divisible by 7, we have:

(N - 1000A + 1000) ≡ 0 mod 7

(N - 100B + 100) ≡ 0 mod 7

(N - 10C + 10) ≡ 0 mod 7

(N - D + 1) ≡ 0 mod 7

Let me write these as:

1. N ≡ 1000A - 1000 mod 7

2. N ≡ 100B - 100 mod 7

3. N ≡ 10C - 10 mod 7

4. N ≡ D - 1 mod 7

Wait, no, actually, each equation can be rearranged as:

1. N ≡ (1000A - 1000) mod 7

But 1000 mod 7 is equal to what? Let me compute 1000 divided by 7.

7*142=994, so 1000-994=6. So 1000 ≡ 6 mod 7.

Therefore, 1000A ≡6A mod7.

Similarly, 1000 ≡6 mod7, so 1000A - 1000 ≡6A - 6 mod7.

So equation 1 becomes N ≡6(A - 1) mod7.

Similarly, equation 2: 100B -100 mod7.

100 mod7: 7*14=98, 100-98=2. So 100 ≡2 mod7.

So 100B -100 ≡2B -2 mod7. So equation 2: N ≡2(B -1) mod7.

Equation3: 10C -10 mod7. 10 mod7 is 3, so 10C -10 ≡3C -3 mod7. So equation3: N ≡3(C -1) mod7.

Equation4: D -1 mod7. So equation4: N ≡(D -1) mod7.

So now, all four congruences must hold. So N must satisfy:

N ≡6(A -1) mod7,

N ≡2(B -1) mod7,

N ≡3(C -1) mod7,

N ≡(D -1) mod7.

But N itself is equal to 1000A + 100B + 10C + D. So N mod7 can be computed as (1000A + 100B +10C + D) mod7.

We already know that 1000 ≡6, 100≡2, 10≡3, and 1≡1 mod7.

So N mod7 = (6A + 2B + 3C + D) mod7.

Therefore, the four congruences can be rewritten as:

1. (6A + 2B + 3C + D) ≡6(A -1) mod7

2. (6A + 2B + 3C + D) ≡2(B -1) mod7

3. (6A + 2B + 3C + D) ≡3(C -1) mod7

4. (6A + 2B + 3C + D) ≡(D -1) mod7

Let me simplify each equation.

Starting with equation1:

6A + 2B +3C + D ≡6A -6 mod7

Subtract 6A from both sides:

2B +3C + D ≡ -6 mod7

Which is 2B +3C + D ≡1 mod7 (since -6 ≡1 mod7).

Equation2:

6A +2B +3C + D ≡2B -2 mod7

Subtract 2B: 6A +3C + D ≡-2 mod7

Which is 6A +3C + D ≡5 mod7 (since -2 ≡5 mod7).

Equation3:

6A +2B +3C + D ≡3C -3 mod7

Subtract 3C: 6A +2B + D ≡-3 mod7

Which is 6A +2B + D ≡4 mod7 (since -3 ≡4 mod7).

Equation4:

6A +2B +3C + D ≡D -1 mod7

Subtract D:6A +2B +3C ≡-1 mod7

Which is 6A +2B +3C ≡6 mod7 (since -1 ≡6 mod7).

So now, I have four equations:

1. 2B +3C + D ≡1 mod7

2. 6A +3C + D ≡5 mod7

3. 6A +2B + D ≡4 mod7

4. 6A +2B +3C ≡6 mod7

Hmm. So I have four equations with four variables: A, B, C, D. But these are modular equations, so perhaps I can solve them step by step.

Let me number the equations for reference:

Equation (1): 2B + 3C + D ≡1 mod7

Equation (2): 6A +3C + D ≡5 mod7

Equation (3): 6A +2B + D ≡4 mod7

Equation (4):6A +2B +3C ≡6 mod7

I need to solve for A, B, C, D. Remember that A, B, C, D are digits, so A is from 1-9, and B, C, D are from 0-9.

Let me try to express variables in terms of others.

First, looking at Equation (4): 6A +2B +3C ≡6 mod7.

Let me denote this as Equation (4).

Equation (3): 6A +2B + D ≡4 mod7.

Equation (2):6A +3C + D ≡5 mod7.

Equation (1):2B +3C + D ≡1 mod7.

Perhaps I can subtract Equations (3) and (2) to eliminate 6A.

Equation (2) - Equation (3):

(6A +3C + D) - (6A +2B + D) ≡5 -4 mod7

Which gives: (3C - 2B) ≡1 mod7.

So 3C - 2B ≡1 mod7. Let's call this Equation (5).

Similarly, subtract Equation (3) from Equation (4):

Equation (4):6A +2B +3C ≡6

Equation (3):6A +2B + D ≡4

Subtract (3) from (4):

(6A +2B +3C) - (6A +2B + D) ≡6 -4 mod7

Which gives: (3C - D) ≡2 mod7.

So 3C - D ≡2 mod7. Let's call this Equation (6).

Similarly, subtract Equation (1) from Equation (2):

Equation (2):6A +3C + D ≡5

Equation (1):2B +3C + D ≡1

Subtract (1) from (2):

(6A +3C + D) - (2B +3C + D) ≡5 -1 mod7

Which gives: (6A - 2B) ≡4 mod7.

Divide both sides by 2: 3A - B ≡2 mod7.

So 3A - B ≡2 mod7. Let's call this Equation (7).

Now, Equation (7): 3A - B ≡2 mod7.

Equation (5):3C - 2B ≡1 mod7.

Equation (6):3C - D ≡2 mod7.

We have these three equations now.

Also, Equation (3):6A +2B + D ≡4 mod7.

Hmm. Let me see if I can express variables in terms of others.

From Equation (7): 3A - B ≡2 mod7. Let's solve for B: B ≡3A -2 mod7.

Since B is a digit (0-9), perhaps we can write B = 3A -2 +7k, where k is an integer.

But since B is between 0 and 9, let's see possible values.

Let's consider A from 1 to9.

We can write B = (3A -2) mod7, but given B is 0-9, perhaps it's better to express B as (3A -2) +7k, and find possible k for each A such that B is a digit.

But maybe let's try to express B in terms of A:

B ≡3A -2 mod7.

So B can be written as B = 3A -2 +7m, where m is an integer such that B is 0-9.

Similarly, let's take this approach.

But perhaps first, let's handle Equation (5):3C -2B ≡1 mod7.

We can substitute B from Equation (7) into Equation (5).

From Equation (7): B ≡3A -2 mod7.

So, substitute into Equation (5):

3C - 2*(3A -2) ≡1 mod7.

Simplify:

3C -6A +4 ≡1 mod7.

Rearranged: 3C -6A ≡-3 mod7.

Which is 3C -6A ≡4 mod7 (since -3 ≡4 mod7).

Factor out 3: 3(C -2A) ≡4 mod7.

Multiply both sides by the modular inverse of 3 mod7. Since 3*5=15≡1 mod7, the inverse of 3 is 5.

So, multiply both sides by5:

15*(C -2A) ≡20 mod7.

15≡1 mod7, so:

(C -2A) ≡20 mod7.

20 mod7 is 20-2*7=6. So:

C -2A ≡6 mod7.

So, C ≡2A +6 mod7.

Since C is a digit (0-9), C can be written as C =2A +6 +7n, where n is integer such that C is between 0 and9.

So, let's compute possible C for each A.

But perhaps first, let's handle Equation (6):3C -D ≡2 mod7.

From Equation (6): D ≡3C -2 mod7.

We can express D in terms of C.

So D =3C -2 +7p, where p is integer such that D is 0-9.

Now, Equation (3):6A +2B + D ≡4 mod7.

We can substitute B and D in terms of A and C.

From Equation (7): B=3A -2 +7m.

From Equation (6): D=3C -2 +7p.

So Equation (3):

6A +2*(3A -2 +7m) + (3C -2 +7p) ≡4 mod7.

Let me expand this:

6A +6A -4 +14m +3C -2 +7p ≡4 mod7.

Combine like terms:

(6A +6A) + ( -4 -2 ) + (14m +7p) +3C ≡4 mod7.

12A -6 +7*(2m +p) +3C ≡4 mod7.

Simplify each term modulo7:

12A mod7: 12-7=5, so 5A.

-6 mod7: 1 (since -6 +7=1).

7*(...) mod7: 0.

3C mod7.

So, Equation becomes:

5A +1 +3C ≡4 mod7.

So, 5A +3C ≡3 mod7.

But from earlier, we have C ≡2A +6 mod7.

So, substitute C into this equation.

C ≡2A +6 mod7.

So,

5A +3*(2A +6) ≡3 mod7.

Compute:

5A +6A +18 ≡3 mod7.

Combine like terms:

11A +18 ≡3 mod7.

11 mod7 is 4, 18 mod7 is 4 (since 14 is 2*7, 18-14=4).

So,

4A +4 ≡3 mod7.

Subtract 4:

4A ≡-1 mod7.

Which is 4A ≡6 mod7.

Multiply both sides by inverse of 4 mod7. 4*2=8≡1 mod7, so inverse is 2.

Thus,

A ≡6*2 mod7.

A ≡12 mod7.

12 mod7 is 5. So A ≡5 mod7.

Since A is a digit from 1-9, possible A values are 5 and 12, but 12 is invalid. So A=5.

Wait, but wait: 5 mod7 is 5, but 5+7=12, which is invalid as a digit. So A must be 5.

Wait, but 5 is less than7, so A=5 is the only possibility.

So, A=5.

Now, let's find B, C, D.

From Equation (7): B ≡3A -2 mod7.

A=5, so 3*5=15, 15-2=13.

13 mod7: 13-7=6. So B≡6 mod7.

So possible B is 6, or 6+7=13 (invalid). So B=6.

From earlier, C ≡2A +6 mod7. A=5, so 2*5=10, 10+6=16.

16 mod7: 16-14=2. So C≡2 mod7.

So C can be 2 or 2+7=9 (since digits go up to 9). So possible C=2 or 9.

Similarly, from Equation (6): D ≡3C -2 mod7.

Since C=2 or 9, let's compute D for each case.

Case 1: C=2.

D ≡3*2 -2=6-2=4 mod7. So D=4 or 4+7=11 (invalid). So D=4.

Case 2: C=9.

D ≡3*9 -2=27-2=25 mod7.

25 divided by7 is 3*7=21, so 25-21=4. So D≡4 mod7.

So D=4 or 11 (invalid). So D=4.

So in both cases, D=4.

Wait, so regardless of C being 2 or 9, D is 4.

Hmm, interesting.

Wait, let me double-check:

If C=2:

D
