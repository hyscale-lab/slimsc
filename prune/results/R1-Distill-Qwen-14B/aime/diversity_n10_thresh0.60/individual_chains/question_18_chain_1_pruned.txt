Okay, so I have this problem about finding the number of rectangles that can be formed inside a regular dodecagon. Each side of the rectangle lies on either a side or a diagonal of the dodecagon. Hmm, that sounds a bit tricky, but I think I can figure it out by breaking it down step by step.

First, let me visualize a regular dodecagon. It's a 12-sided polygon with all sides equal and all internal angles equal. Since it's regular, it's also convex, so all the vertices point outward, and no sides cross each other. Now, the problem mentions that the sides of the rectangles lie on either the sides or the diagonals of the dodecagon. So, the sides of the rectangles must be aligned with these edges or diagonals.

I remember that in regular polygons, especially those with an even number of sides, rectangles can be formed by connecting non-adjacent vertices. But wait, in a dodecagon, how do the diagonals work? I think the key is to figure out how many pairs of parallel sides or diagonals there are because a rectangle requires two pairs of parallel sides.

So, maybe I should first figure out how many different lengths of sides and diagonals exist in a regular dodecagon. Since it's regular, the lengths depend on the number of sides apart the vertices are. For example, in a dodecagon, the side length is the distance between two adjacent vertices. The next diagonal would be between vertices that are two apart, then three, and so on, up to five because beyond that, the diagonals start repeating in the opposite direction.

Wait, let me think about that. In a regular n-gon, the number of distinct diagonals is given by n(n - 3)/2, but that counts all diagonals regardless of length. But for lengths, each diagonal can be identified by the number of sides it skips. So, in a dodecagon, the possible steps between vertices are 1 (sides), 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6. Wait, but step 6 would actually be a diameter, right? Because in a 12-gon, stepping six vertices apart brings you directly opposite the starting point. So, those are diameters.

But wait, when considering rectangles, the opposite sides must be equal and parallel. So, perhaps I need to find sets of four points where two pairs of points are connected by diagonals of the same length and are parallel.

Hmm, maybe I should think in terms of selecting two pairs of parallel sides or diagonals that intersect each other to form a rectangle. So, how many pairs of parallel lines are there in the dodecagon?

In a regular dodecagon, each side has multiple parallel sides. For instance, each side is parallel to the sides that are separated by certain steps. Wait, no, actually, in a regular polygon, sides are not parallel unless the polygon has an even number of sides, which it does here (12). So, opposite sides are parallel. Similarly, diagonals can be parallel if they are separated by certain steps.

Let me try to figure out how many sets of parallel lines there are. For sides: each side is part of a set of 6 parallel sides, since in a dodecagon, every other side is parallel.
