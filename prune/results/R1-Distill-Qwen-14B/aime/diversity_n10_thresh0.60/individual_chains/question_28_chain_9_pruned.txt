Okay, so I've got this tetrahedron problem. Let me try to visualize it first. A tetrahedron has four triangular faces, and in this case, all the opposite edges are equal. So AB equals CD, AC equals BD, and BC equals AD. The lengths are given as sqrt(41), sqrt(80), and sqrt(89) respectively.

The question is asking about a point I inside the tetrahedron that's equidistant from all four faces. I remember that in a tetrahedron, such a point is called the incenter, similar to the incenter of a triangle. The distance from the incenter to each face is called the inradius. So I need to find this inradius.

I recall that the formula for the inradius (r) of a tetrahedron is given by r = 3V / S, where V is the volume of the tetrahedron and S is the total surface area. So, I need to find the volume and the surface area.

But wait, the problem doesn't give me the coordinates of the vertices, so calculating the volume directly might be tricky. Hmm... Maybe there's a way to assign coordinates to the vertices such that the opposite edges are equal. That might make things symmetric and easier to compute.

Let me try to place the tetrahedron in a coordinate system. Since opposite edges are equal, perhaps I can set it up so that the midpoints of opposite edges are at the origin, or maybe align some edges along axes.

Wait, another approach. I remember that if a tetrahedron has all pairs of opposite edges equal, it's called an isosceles tetrahedron. An isosceles tetrahedron has some nice properties, like having its centroid (which coincides with the incenter) at the midpoint of the line segment joining the midpoints of opposite edges.

But I'm not sure if that helps directly. Maybe I should try to compute the volume using the given edge lengths.

To find the volume of a tetrahedron given all six edge lengths, I can use the formula involving the determinant of a matrix, but that's a bit complicated. Alternatively, maybe I can split the tetrahedron into two parts or find the area of the faces and use some relation.

Wait, another thought: in an isosceles tetrahedron, the volume can be
