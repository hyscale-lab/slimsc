Okay, so I've got this tetrahedron ABCD with some specific edge lengths. The problem is asking for the distance from the incenter (the point equidistant from all faces) to each face. The distance is supposed to be in a particular form, and then I need to find the sum m + n + p where the distance is written as m√n / p.

First, let me note down all the given edge lengths. It's given that:

- AB = CD = √41
- AC = BD = √80
- BC = AD = √89

Hmm, interesting. So, each pair of opposite edges are equal. That makes me think the tetrahedron might be isohedral or something, but I'm not sure. Anyway, moving on.

I remember that in a tetrahedron, the inradius can be found using the formula:

r = 3V / S

where V is the volume of the tetrahedron and S is the total surface area. So, I need to find both the volume and the surface area.

But wait, the surface area is the sum of the areas of all four triangular faces. So, I need to find the area of each face.

Let me list the faces:

1. Triangle ABC
2. Triangle ABD
3. Triangle ACD
4. Triangle BCD

Wait, but given the edge lengths, maybe each pair of opposite faces are congruent? Let me check.

Looking at the edges:

- For face ABC: edges AB = √41, BC = √89, AC = √80
- For face ABD: edges AB = √41, AD = √89, BD = √80
- For face ACD: edges AC = √80, CD = √41, AD = √89
- For face BCD: edges BC = √89, CD = √41, BD = √80

So, each face is a triangle with sides √41, √80, √89. That means all four faces are congruent triangles. So, each face has the same area.

That's helpful because then the total surface area S is just 4 times the area of one face.

So, first, I can calculate the area of one face, say triangle ABC with sides √41, √80, √89.

To find the area of a triangle when all three sides are known, I can use Heron's formula. Heron's formula says that the area is √[s(s - a)(s - b)(s - c)], where s is the semi-perimeter.

So, let's compute s for triangle ABC.

s = (√41 + √80 + √89) / 2

Hmm, that's a bit messy. Maybe there's another way, like using the Pythagorean theorem if the triangle is right-angled?

Wait, let me check if triangle ABC is right-angled. Let's square all sides:

AB² = 41

AC² = 80

BC² = 89

Is 41 + 80 equal to 89?

41 +
