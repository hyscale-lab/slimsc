Okay, so I have this problem about Aya going for a walk every morning. Hmm, let me try to understand what's going on here. 

So, every morning, Aya walks 9 kilometers. She has two different walking speeds, and each time she includes some time in a coffee shop. The problem gives me two scenarios with different speeds and the total time each takes, including the coffee shop time. Then, I need to find the time it takes when she walks at a speed halfway between the two given speeds. 

Let's break down the information given. 

First scenario: She walks at a constant speed of s kilometers per hour. The total time this takes is 4 hours. But that 4 hours includes t minutes spent in the coffee shop. 

Wait, t is in minutes, but the walking speed and time are in hours. So I might need to convert t into hours to keep the units consistent. 

Second scenario: She walks at s + 2 kilometers per hour, and the total time is 2 hours and 24 minutes. Again, this includes t minutes in the coffee shop. 

I need to find the total time when she walks at s + 1/2 kilometers per hour, including t minutes.

So, it's a problem involving speed, distance, and time. Since the distance is constant at 9 km, I can set up equations based on the two scenarios.

Let me write down what I know:

In the first case:
- Speed = s km/h
- Time walking = let's denote it as T1 hours
- Total time including coffee shop = 4 hours
- So, T1 + t/60 = 4 hours. Because t is in minutes, I need to convert it to hours by dividing by 60.

Wait, no. Alternatively, maybe it's better to convert all times to hours or all to minutes. Let me think. Since the walking time is in hours and t is in minutes, perhaps it's better to convert the total time into minutes. Let me try that.

First scenario total time: 4 hours = 240 minutes. So walking time plus coffee time equals 240 minutes.

Second scenario: 2 hours 24 minutes = (2*60 +24) = 144 minutes. So walking time plus t minutes is 144.

So, let me denote:

For first scenario:
Walking time: distance/speed = 9/s hours. Convert that into minutes: (9/s)*60 minutes.

So, (9/s)*60 + t = 240.

Similarly, for the second scenario:
Walking time is 9/(s+2) hours, which is (9/(s+2))*60 minutes.

So, (9/(s+2))*60 + t = 144.

Now I have two equations:

1) (540)/s + t = 240

2) (540)/(s+2) + t = 144

Hmm, okay, so I can subtract equation 2 from equation 1 to eliminate t.

Equation 1 minus equation 2:

(540/s - 540/(s+2)) = 240 - 144 = 96.

So, (540/s) - (540/(s+2)) = 96.

Let me factor out 540:

540*(1/s - 1/(s+2)) = 96.

Simplify the terms inside the parentheses:

1/s - 1/(s+2) = [ (s+2) - s ] / [s(s+2)] = 2 / [s(s+2)]

So, the equation becomes:

540*(2)/(s(s+2)) = 96.

Simplify numerator:

540*2 = 1080. So,

1080 / [s(s+2)] = 96.

Multiply both sides by s(s+2):

1080 = 96 * s(s+2).

Divide both sides by 96:

1080 / 96 = s(s+2).

Let me calculate 1080 divided by 96.

Hmm, 96 goes into 1080 how many times?

96 * 10 = 960.

1080 - 960 = 120.

96 goes into 120 once, with 24 remaining.

Wait, that's 10 + 1 = 11, with 24 left. So 1080 /96 = 11.25.

Wait, 96 * 11 = 1056, 1080 - 1056 = 24. So 24/96 = 0.25. So 11.25.

So, s(s+2) = 11.25.

So, s² + 2s - 11.25 = 0.

Now, I need to solve this quadratic equation for s.

Quadratic equation: s² + 2s - 11.25 = 0.

Using quadratic formula: s = [ -b ± sqrt(b² -4ac) ] / 2a.

Here, a=1, b=2, c=-11.25.

Discriminant D = b² -4ac = 4 -4*(1)*(-11.25) = 4 + 45 = 49.

Square root of 49 is 7.

So, s = [ -2 ±7 ] / 2.

We have two solutions:

s = (-2 +7)/2 = 5/2 = 2.5 km/h.

s = (-2 -7)/2 = -9/2 = -4.5 km/h.

But speed can't be negative, so s = 2.5 km/h.

Wait, that's interesting. So her original speed is 2.5 km/h. Let me check if that makes sense.

So, s=2.5 km/h.

Now, let's find t. Let me use equation 1:

(540)/s + t = 240.

Plug s=2.5:

540 /2.5 = 216.

So, 216 + t = 240 => t=24 minutes.

So, she spends 24 minutes in the coffee shop each time.

Now, the question is, when she walks at s + 1/2 km/h, which is 2.5 + 0.5 = 3 km/h.

So, her walking speed is 3 km/h.

We need to find the total time, which is walking time plus t=24 minutes.

So, walking time is 9 km / 3 km/h = 3 hours. 

Convert that to minutes: 3*60=180 minutes.

Add the coffee shop time: 180 +24=204 minutes.

Wait, the question says "the number of minutes the walk takes her, including the t minutes spent in the coffee shop." So, 204 minutes is the total time.

Wait, but let me double-check everything because sometimes when setting up equations, mistakes can happen.

Let me recap:

We had two equations:

1) (540/s) + t = 240

2) (540/(s+2)) + t = 144

Subtracting the second from the first gives:

540*(1/s -1/(s+2)) =96.

Which simplified to s(s+2)=11.25, leading to s=2.5.

Then, t=240 - (540/2.5) =240 -216=24 minutes.

Then, new speed is 3 km/h.

Walking time:9/3=3 hours=180 minutes.

Total time:180+24=204 minutes.

That seems right.

Wait, but let me check with the second scenario to make sure.

At s+2=4.5 km/h.

Walking time:9/4.5=2 hours.

Convert to minutes:120 minutes. Add t=24 minutes:144 minutes, which matches the given 2 hours 24 minutes.

So, yes, that's correct.

So, the answer should be 204 minutes.


To solve the problem, we analyze Aya's walking scenarios and set up equations based on the given information.

1. **First Scenario**:
   - Speed: \( s \) km/h
   - Total time: 4 hours (240 minutes)
   - Walking time: \( \frac{9}{s} \) hours, which is \( \frac{540}{s} \) minutes.
   - Equation: \( \frac{540}{s} + t = 240 \).

2. **Second Scenario**:
   - Speed: \( s + 2 \) km/h
   - Total time: 2 hours 24 minutes (144 minutes)
   - Walking time: \( \frac{9}{s+2} \) hours, which is \( \frac{540}{s+2} \) minutes.
   - Equation: \( \frac{540}{s+2} + t = 144 \).

Subtracting the second equation from the first to eliminate \( t \):
\[
\frac{540}{s} - \frac{540}{s+2} = 96
\]
Simplifying:
\[
540 \left( \frac{1}{s} - \frac{1}{s+2} \right) = 96
\]
\[
540 \left( \frac{2}{s(s+2)} \right) = 96
\]
\[
\frac{1080}{s(s+2)} = 96
\]
\[
s(s+2) = \frac{1080}{96} = 11.25
\]
Solving the quadratic equation \( s^2 + 2s - 11.25 = 0 \) using the quadratic formula:
\[
s = \frac{-2 \pm \sqrt{4 + 45}}{2} = \frac{-2 \pm 7}{2}
\]
Since speed cannot be negative, \( s = 2.5 \) km/h.

Using \( s = 2.5 \) in the first equation to find \( t \):
\[
\frac{540}{2.5} + t = 240 \implies 216 + t = 240 \implies t = 24 \text{ minutes}.
\]

For the new speed \( s + \frac{1}{2} = 3 \) km/h:
- Walking time: \( \frac{9}{3} = 3 \) hours \( = 180 \) minutes.
- Total time including coffee: \( 180 + 24 = 204 \) minutes.

The final answer is:
\boxed{204}
