Okay, so I have this problem here: Let ω ≠ 1 be a 13th root of unity. I need to find the remainder when the product from k=0 to 12 of (2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k}) is divided by 1000. Hmm, that seems a bit intimidating at first glance, but let me try to break it down step by step.

First, I remember that roots of unity have some special properties, especially when it comes to cyclotomic polynomials. Maybe I can use that here. Since ω is a primitive 13th root of unity, it satisfies ω^13 = 1, and any power of ω can be reduced modulo 13. So, for example, ω^13 = 1, ω^14 = ω, and so on.

The product given is over k from 0 to 12, which are all the exponents of ω. So each term is 2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k}. Maybe I can factor this expression or find a pattern in the product.

Let me write the product P as the product from k=0 to 12 of (2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k}). So, P = ∏_{k=0}^{12} (2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k}).

Wait, maybe I can factor each term. Let me look at the term 2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k}. Let me rearrange the terms: ω^{2k} - 2ω^k + 2. That looks a bit like a quadratic in ω^k. Let me consider it as a quadratic equation: x^2 - 2x + 2, where x = ω^k.

So, each term is x^2 - 2x + 2, which can be factored or perhaps related to a cyclotomic polynomial. Wait, the cyclotomic polynomial for 13th roots is Φ_13(x), which is x^12 + x^11 + ... + x + 1. Hmm, not sure if that's directly helpful.

Alternatively, maybe I can find a generating polynomial whose roots are these terms. Or perhaps I can relate each term to a quadratic in ω^k and then use properties of roots of unity.

Let me compute each term. For each k, the term is (2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k}). Let me see what this equals. Let me denote ω^k as ζ for simplicity. So the term becomes 2 - 2ζ + ζ². Let me compute this: 2 - 2ζ + ζ².

Hmm, maybe I can factor this expression. Let me write it as ζ² - 2ζ + 2. Let me see if this factors. The discriminant of the quadratic is (−2)^2 − 4*1*2 = 4 - 8 = -4. So it doesn't factor over the reals, but it can be written in terms of complex numbers. Alternatively, perhaps I can relate this to some known polynomial.

Wait, another approach: Since ω is a 13th root of unity, ω^k runs through all the 13th roots of unity as k goes from 0 to 12. So ζ = ω^k, which is another 13th root of unity. So each term is 2 - 2ζ + ζ². So the product becomes the product over all 13th roots of unity ζ ≠ 1 of (2 - 2ζ + ζ²), because when k=0, ζ=1, but the problem states ω ≠1, so maybe k=0 isn't included? Wait, wait, the problem says ω ≠1 is a 13th root of unity, and the product is from k=0 to 12. Hmm, but ω^0 = 1, so in that case, when k=0, the term is 2 - 2*1 + 1^2 = 2 - 2 + 1 = 1. So that term is 1. So the product is 1 times the product from k=1 to 12 of (2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k}).

Wait, but maybe the product is from k=0 to 12, so including k=0, which gives 1. So the entire product is the product over all 13th roots of unity ζ of (2 - 2ζ + ζ²). Because when k=0, ζ=1, which is a 13th root of unity as well. So the product is over all ζ such that ζ^13 =1.

Hmm, so if I can find the product of (2 - 2ζ + ζ²) for all ζ^13=1, that would be the value P. But how?

I remember that for any polynomial f(x), the product of (x - ζ) for all ζ being the roots of unity is the cyclotomic polynomial. But here, the product is over a quadratic expression in ζ. So maybe I can relate this to evaluating a certain polynomial at a specific value.

Let me think: the product over all ζ^13=1 of (a - bζ + cζ²) can be related to some polynomial evaluated at a certain point. Alternatively, perhaps I can think of it as evaluating a resultant or something similar.

Wait, another approach: Since the product is over all 13th roots of unity, perhaps I can find a polynomial whose roots are 2 - 2ζ + ζ² for each ζ. Then the product would be the constant term (up to sign) of that polynomial. But that seems a bit abstract.

Alternatively, I can consider that for each ζ, ζ^13=1, so we can write the product as product_{ζ^13=1} (2 - 2ζ + ζ^2). Let me denote f(ζ) = 2 - 2ζ + ζ^2. So the product is the product of f(ζ) for all ζ^13=1.

I remember that the product over all ζ of f(ζ) is equal to the resultant of f(x) and x^13 - 1, but I'm not sure about that. Alternatively, perhaps I can use the fact that the product over ζ of (x - ζ) is the cyclotomic polynomial Φ_13(x). But in this case, it's f(ζ) = 2 - 2ζ + ζ². Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I can write f(ζ) = ζ² - 2ζ + 2. Let me factor this as (ζ - a)(ζ - b), where a and b are the roots of ζ² - 2ζ + 2 = 0. The roots are [2 ± sqrt(4 - 8)] / 2 = [2 ± sqrt(-4)] / 2 = 1 ± i. So the roots are 1+i and 1−i. Interesting, so f(ζ) = (ζ - (1+i))(ζ - (1−i)).

So the product over all ζ^13=1 of f(ζ) is the product over ζ of (ζ - (1+i))(ζ - (1−i)). But the product over ζ of (x - ζ) is Φ_13(x), which is the 13th cyclotomic polynomial. Wait, no, Φ_13(x) is the minimal polynomial for primitive 13th roots, but in this case, the product over all ζ^13=1 of (x - ζ) is x^13 - 1, because that polynomial has all the 13th roots of unity as roots.

So, product_{ζ^13=1} (x - ζ) = x^13 - 1.

But in our case, we have product_{ζ^13=1} (ζ - (1+i))(ζ - (1−i)) = product_{ζ^13=1} f(ζ). Wait, but f(ζ) is (ζ - (1+i))(ζ - (1−i)), so the product becomes product_{ζ^13=1} (ζ - (1+i))(ζ - (1−i)) = [product_{ζ^13=1} (ζ - (1+i))] * [product_{ζ^13=1} (ζ - (1−i))].

Each of these products is the evaluation of the polynomial x^13 - 1 at x = (1+i) and x = (1−i). Because product_{ζ^13=1} (x - ζ) = x^13 -1. So substituting x = (1+i), we get product_{ζ} ((1+i) - ζ) = (1+i)^13 -1. Similarly for (1−i).

So the product becomes [(1+i)^13 -1] * [(1−i)^13 -1].

Wow, okay, that seems promising. So then P = [(1+i)^13 -1] * [(1−i)^13 -1]. So all I need to do is compute this product and then find the remainder modulo 1000.

Wait, but (1+i) and (1−i) are complex conjugates, and their powers might have symmetries. Let me compute (1+i)^13 and (1−i)^13.

First, let me compute (1+i)^n. I know that 1+i can be written in polar form. The modulus is sqrt(2), and the argument is π/4. So (1+i) = sqrt(2) * e^{iπ/4}. Therefore, (1+i)^n = (sqrt(2))^n * e^{i n π/4}.

Similarly, (1−i) = sqrt(2) * e^{-iπ/4}, so (1−i)^n = (sqrt(2))^n * e^{-i n π/4}.

So let's compute (1+i)^13:

(1+i)^13 = (sqrt(2))^13 * e^{i 13 π/4}.

Similarly, (1−i)^13 = (sqrt(2))^13 * e^{-i 13 π/4}.

Let me compute (sqrt(2))^13. sqrt(2) is 2^{1/2}, so (2^{1/2})^13 = 2^{13/2} = 2^6 * 2^{1/2} = 64 * sqrt(2).

Now, the exponent e^{i 13 π/4}. Let's simplify 13 π/4. Since 13 divided by 4 is 3 with a remainder of 1, so 13 π/4 = 3 π + π/4. But that's more than 2π, so let's subtract 2π to get the equivalent angle.

Wait, 13 π/4 is equal to 3π + π/4, which is 3π + 45 degrees. But 3π is 540 degrees, which is equivalent to 180 degrees (since 540 mod 360 is 180). So 3π + π/4 is equivalent to π + π/4 = 5π/4, which is 225 degrees. Alternatively, 13π/4 = 3π + π/4 = π/4 (mod 2π) but wait, 13π/4 minus 2π is 13π/4 - 8π/4 = 5π/4.

So e^{i 13 π/4} = e^{i 5π/4} = cos(5π/4) + i sin(5π/4) = -sqrt(2)/2 - i sqrt(2)/2.

Similarly, e^{-i 13 π/4} = e^{-i 5π/4} = cos(5π/4) - i sin(5π/4) = -sqrt(2)/2 + i sqrt(2)/2.

So, (1+i)^13 = 64 sqrt(2) * (-sqrt(2)/2 - i sqrt(2)/2) = 64 sqrt(2) * [ (-sqrt(2)/2)(1 + i) ) ].

Let me compute that: sqrt(2) * (-sqrt(2)/2) = (2^{1/2})(-2^{1/2}/2) )= (-2)/2 = -1. So (1+i)^13 = 64 * (-1)(1 + i) = -64(1 + i).

Similarly, (1−i)^13 = 64 sqrt(2) * (-sqrt(2)/2 + i sqrt(2)/2) = 64 sqrt(2) * [ (-sqrt(2)/2)(1 - i) ) ].

Again, sqrt(2)*(-sqrt(2)/2) = -1. So (1−i)^13 = 64 * (-1)(1 - i) = -64(1 - i).

So now, let's compute [(1+i)^13 -1] and [(1−i)^13 -1].

(1+i)^13 - 1 = (-64(1 + i)) - 1 = -64 -64i -1 = -65 -64i.

Similarly, (1−i)^13 -1 = (-64(1 - i)) -1 = -64 +64i -1 = -65 +64i.

So the product becomes:

(-65 -64i) * (-65 +64i) = ?

That's a product of a complex number and its conjugate, so it's equal to the square of the modulus.

Compute modulus squared: (-65)^2 + (64)^2 = 4225 + 4096 = 8321.

Wait, let me compute that:

65^2 = 4225,

64^2 = 4096,

So 4225 + 4096 = 8321.

So the product is 8321.

Wait, so P = product_{k=0}^{12} (2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k}) = 8321.

But wait, the problem says ω ≠1 is a 13th root of unity, and the product is from k=0 to 12, which includes k=0, giving ζ=1, which we accounted for earlier. So that term was 1, as we saw earlier, so the total product is indeed 8321.

Wait, but I thought earlier P was the product over all ζ^13=1 of f(ζ), which includes ζ=1, which gives f(1) = 2 - 2*1 +1² = 1. So the product is 1 * [product over ζ ≠1 of f(ζ)] = 8321. So yes, that makes sense.

But wait, earlier I calculated product_{ζ^13=1} f(ζ) = 8321, which includes ζ=1, so the product is 8321. So that's our P.

Wait, but 8321 is a 4-digit number. The problem asks for the remainder when this product is divided by 1000. So 8321 mod 1000 is 321.

So the remainder is 321.

But wait, before I conclude, let me double-check my calculations because sometimes with complex numbers, signs can be tricky.

Let me recompute (1+i)^13:

(1+i)^1 = 1+i,

(1+i)^2 = 2i,

(1+i)^4 = (2i)^2 = -4,

(1+i)^8 = (-4)^2 = 16,

(1+i)^13 = (1+i)^8 * (1+i)^4 * (1+i)^1 = 16 * (-4) * (1+i) = -64(1+i). Yes, that's correct.

Similarly, (1−i)^13 = -64(1 - i). Correct.

So (1+i)^13 -1 = -64(1+i) -1 = (-64 -1) -64i = -65 -64i. Correct.

Similarly, (1−i)^13 -1 = -64(1 -i) -1 = (-64 -1) +64i = -65 +64i. Correct.

Multiplying these: (-65 -64i)(-65 +64i) = (-65)^2 - (64i)^2 = 4225 - (64^2)(i^2) = 4225 - 4096*(-1) = 4225 + 4096 = 8321. Correct.

So 8321 mod 1000: 8321 divided by 1000 is 8 with 321 remaining, so the remainder is 321.

Wait, but let me check: 8321 / 1000 is 8*1000=8000, 8321-8000=321. So yes, 321 is correct.

Therefore, the remainder is 321.


To solve the problem, we start by recognizing that ω is a primitive 13th root of unity, meaning ω^13 = 1 and ω^k for k = 0, 1, ..., 12 are all distinct 13th roots of unity. The given product is:

\[
P = \prod_{k=0}^{12} (2 - 2\omega^k + \omega^{2k})
\]

We can rewrite each term as a quadratic in ω^k:

\[
2 - 2\omega^k + \omega^{2k} = \omega^{2k} - 2\omega^k + 2
\]

This quadratic can be factored as:

\[
\omega^{2k} - 2\omega^k + 2 = (\omega^k - (1 + i))(\omega^k - (1 - i))
\]

Thus, the product becomes:

\[
P = \prod_{k=0}^{12} (\omega^k - (1 + i))(\omega^k - (1 - i))
\]

This can be expressed as:

\[
P = \left(\prod_{k=0}^{12} (\omega^k - (1 + i))\right) \left(\prod_{k=0}^{12} (\omega^k - (1 - i))\right)
\]

Since the product of (x - ζ) over all 13th roots of unity ζ is x^13 - 1, we substitute x = 1 + i and x = 1 - i:

\[
\prod_{k=0}^{12} (\omega^k - (1 + i)) = (1 + i)^{13} - 1
\]
\[
\prod_{k=0}^{12} (\omega^k - (1 - i)) = (1 - i)^{13} - 1
\]

Calculating (1 + i)^13 and (1 - i)^13:

\[
(1 + i)^{13} = -64(1 + i)
\]
\[
(1 - i)^{13} = -64(1 - i)
\]

Thus:

\[
(1 + i)^{13} - 1 = -65 - 64i
\]
\[
(1 - i)^{13} - 1 = -65 + 64i
\]

Multiplying these results:

\[
(-65 - 64i)(-65 + 64i) = (-65)^2 + (64)^2 = 4225 + 4096 = 8321
\]

Finally, the remainder when 8321 is divided by 1000 is:

\[
8321 \mod 1000 = 321
\]

The remainder is \boxed{321}.
