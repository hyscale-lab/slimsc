Okay, so I need to figure out this problem about a torus and a sphere. Let me take it step by step because it's a bit confusing. 

First, I know that a torus is like a donut shape. It's created by revolving a circle around an axis. In this case, the circle has a radius of 3, and the axis is in the same plane as the circle but 6 units away from the center. So, if I imagine a circle with radius 3, the center is 6 units away from the axis of revolution. That should make the major radius (the distance from the center of the tube to the center of the torus) 6, and the minor radius (the radius of the tube itself) 3. So, the torus has major radius R = 6 and minor radius r = 3.

Now, there's a sphere S with radius 11. The problem says when the torus T rests on the inside of S, it's internally tangent along a circle with radius r_i, and when it rests on the outside, it's externally tangent along a circle with radius r_o. I need to find the difference r_i - r_o and express it as a fraction m/n, then find m + n.

Hmm, okay, so when the torus is inside the sphere, it's tangent internally. That should mean the sphere and torus touch at exactly one point along a circle. Similarly, when the torus is outside, they are tangent along another circle. I think I need to find the radii of these circles of tangency.

Let me visualize this. When the torus is inside the sphere, the closest point on the torus to the center of the sphere must be touching the sphere. Wait, no, actually, since it's tangent along a circle, the entire circle is a point of tangency. So, perhaps I need to find the radius of the circle where the sphere and torus touch when the torus is inside and when it's outside.

I remember that for two surfaces to be tangent along a circle, the centers of the sphere and the center of the generating circle of the torus must lie along the same line, and the distance between their centers must be equal to the sum or difference of their radii, depending on internal or external tangent.

Wait, let me think again. The sphere has radius 11, and the torus is either inside or outside of it. For internal tangency, the sphere is larger, and the torus fits inside such that they touch along a circle. The center of the sphere is fixed, and the center of the torus is somewhere relative to it.

Wait, no, the torus is a surface created by rotating a circle around an axis. So, the center of the generating circle (the original circle) is at a distance R from the axis. In this case, R = 6. But the sphere is another surface with radius 11.

When the torus is inside the sphere, the sphere's center and the torus's center must be separated by a certain distance. Let me denote the center of the sphere as point O and the center of the generating circle of the torus as point C. Then, the distance between O and
