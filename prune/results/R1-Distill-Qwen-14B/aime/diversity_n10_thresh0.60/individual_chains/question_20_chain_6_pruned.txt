Okay, so I've got this math problem here about placing chips on a 5x5 grid. Let me try to understand what the problem is asking.

We have 25 white chips and 25 black chips, but they're indistinguishable except for their color. We need to place some of these chips in the 25 cells of a 5x5 grid. The rules are:

1. Each cell can have at most one chip.
2. All chips in the same row must be the same color, and all chips in the same column must also be the same color.
3. After placing the chips, adding any additional chip would break one or more of the previous two conditions.

So, we need to find the number of ways to do this.

Hmm. Let me try to break this down. The key here seems to be the second condition. All chips in a row must be the same color, and same for columns. But wait, that seems a bit tricky because a row's color could conflict with a column's color if they intersect.

Wait, but let me think. Suppose I decide that each row is either all white or all black. Similarly, each column is either all white or all black. But then, the cells where a row and column intersect must satisfy both the row's color and the column's color. So if a row is white and a column is black, the cell where they meet must be both white and black, which is impossible. Therefore, the only possible way is that all rows and all columns have the same color.

Wait, but that can't be right because then the entire grid would be either all white or all black. But the problem says we can place some chips, so maybe it's not necessary to fill the entire grid.

Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the condition. Let me read again: "all chips in the same row and all chips in the same column have the same color." That doesn't necessarily mean that every row has the same color as every column, just that within a row, all chips are same color, same for columns.

But then, how does that affect the placement? Suppose in row 1, I have all white chips, and in column 1, I have all black chips. Then the cell at (1,1) must be both white (because row 1 is white) and black (because column 1 is black), which is impossible. Therefore, the color of the row and column at their intersection must agree.

So, for any cell (i,j), if row i is color A and column j is color B, then A must equal B. So, this suggests that all the rows and columns must have consistent colors.

Wait, but how? Let me think differently. Maybe the entire grid is such that all rows are white or black, and all columns are white or black, but the rows and columns can have different colors as long as their intersections are consistent.

Wait, but that can't happen. For example, if row 1 is white and row 2 is black, and column 1 is white and column 2 is black, then cell (1,1) is white, cell (1,2) is black, cell (2,1) is black, cell (2,2) is black. Wait, but in this case, cell (1,2)
