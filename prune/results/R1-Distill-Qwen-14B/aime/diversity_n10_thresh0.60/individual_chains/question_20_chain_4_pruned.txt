Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the number of ways to place some chips on a 5x5 grid. The chips are either white or black, and there are 25 of each. Each cell can have at most one chip. The conditions are that all chips in the same row or column must be the same color, and also that adding any more chips would violate these conditions. 

Hmm, let me try to break this down. So, each row and each column can only have chips of one color, right? And once we place chips in such a way that adding another would break the rules, it means that every possible cell is either already occupied or if it's empty, adding a chip there would conflict with its row or column.

Wait, so I think each row must be either all white, all black, or empty. Same for each column. Because if a row has both white and black chips, that would violate the same color condition. Similarly for columns.

But wait, the problem says "some of these chips," so it doesn't have to fill the entire grid. But once you place the chips, you can't add any more without violating the row or column color conditions.

Wait, that makes me think that for each row and column, it's either all white, all black, or empty. Because if a row has some white and some empty cells, you could add a white chip in the empty cell, right? But the condition says that you can't add any more chips because it would violate the conditions. So that implies that every empty cell is such that adding a chip there would cause its row or column to have mixed colors. 

Wait, maybe that's not possible. Let me think. Suppose a row has some white chips and some empty cells. Then, since the row is supposed to have all chips the same color, if I add a chip in an empty cell, it has to be white. But since the row is allowed to have all white, then adding a white chip in an empty cell wouldn't violate the row condition. But what about the column condition? Because the column that the empty cell is in might have some chips of another color.

Wait, so if I have a cell in an empty row and an empty column, adding a chip there would require that the entire row and column become that color. But if the row is currently empty, then adding a white chip would make the entire row white, but the column might already have some chips of a different color, which would conflict.

Wait, no, the column could have some chips, but if the column has all chips of the same color, then adding a different color would violate the column condition. So, if you have an empty cell in a row and column that are both empty, you could add a chip there without violating the row or column conditions, which would mean that the placement isn't maximal yet. So, to make it maximal, every empty cell must be in a row or column that already has chips of a different color. 

Wait, maybe it's better to model this as the grid being partitioned into white, black, and empty regions. But I'm getting a bit confused. Let me try another approach.

Each row and column must be monochromatic (all white, all black, or empty). Since the placement is maximal, every empty cell must be such that placing a chip there would require changing the color of its row or column, which is not allowed because the row and column already have a color. So, every empty cell must be in a row and column that are already occupied with chips of the opposite color.

Wait, no. Let me think again. If a cell is empty, then either its row is non-empty and the color is such that adding a chip would conflict, or the column is non-empty and the same. But since the row and column are already monochromatic, adding a chip of a different color would violate the condition. So, for an empty cell, if its row is non-empty, the color of the row must be different from the color a chip would take in that cell. Similarly for the column.

Wait, that might be the case. Let me formalize this. Suppose cell (i,j) is empty. Then, either row i is non-empty and its color is
