Okay, so I have this problem about a regular octagon where each vertex is colored either red or blue, each with a 50% chance. The question is about finding the probability that there exists a rotation of the octagon such that all the blue vertices end up where the red ones were originally, and vice versa. They mention that this probability is m/n, where m and n are coprime, and I need to find m + n.

Hmm, let me try to understand the problem. So, first, it's a regular octagon, which means all sides and angles are equal. Each vertex is colored red or blue independently with equal probability, so each has a 1/2 chance. Now, the key part is that after coloring, we can rotate the octagon such that all blue vertices move to where the red ones were, and red to blue. So, essentially, after rotation, the color configuration is swapped.

Wait, but does that mean that for each blue vertex, after some rotation, it's moved to a position that was previously red, and all the red ones are moved to where blues were? So, the entire coloring is inverted by some rotation.

So, perhaps another way to think about it is that the coloring is fixed by a rotation, but in a way that swaps colors. But wait, no, because if the coloring is fixed by a rotation, it would mean that the rotation doesn't change the coloring. But here, the rotation changes the colors. So maybe it's more like the coloring is a rotated version of its inverse.

Alternatively, maybe the colorings are related by rotation, and when you rotate the octagon, the blue becomes red and red becomes blue.

Wait, no, that's not exactly. Because if you have a coloring, and you rotate it by some amount, the image you get after rotation has all blue vertices moved to red positions and red to blue. So the coloring after rotation is the inverse of the original.

But I'm a bit confused. Maybe I should think about group theory here. The octagon has rotational symmetries of order 8, right? So the rotation group is cyclic of order 8. Each rotation can be represented by an element of the group, say by rotation by k*45 degrees, where k is from 0 to 7.

So, for each coloring, we can apply these rotations and see if any rotation transforms the set of blue vertices to the set of red vertices. So, the problem is equivalent to asking: what's the probability that there exists a rotation (other than the identity, perhaps?) such that the image of the blue set under rotation is the red set.

Wait, but in the problem statement, it's any rotation, so including the identity? No, because if you rotate by 0 degrees, the coloring remains the same. So, in that case, the blue vertices would have to coincide with the red ones, which is only possible if all vertices are both red and blue, which isn't possible. So, the identity rotation won't help here. So, we need a nontrivial rotation.

So, more formally, for a given coloring, let B be the set of blue vertices and R the set of red ones. We need that there exists a rotation σ such that σ(B) = R. Since the octagon is regular, the rotation σ will map each vertex to another vertex. So, for each vertex v, σ(v) is another vertex.

Since R is
