Okay, let's try to tackle this probability problem. Hmm, so Jen is entering a lottery where she picks 4 distinct numbers from the set S = {1,2,3,...,10}. Then, 4 numbers are randomly chosen from S. She wins a prize if at least two of her numbers match the randomly chosen ones, and she wins the grand prize if all four of her numbers match. We need to find the probability that she wins the grand prize given that she won a prize. The answer should be expressed as a fraction m/n where m and n are coprime, and then find m + n.

Alright, let me break this down. First, I think this is a conditional probability problem. The probability we're looking for is P(Grand Prize | Prize). Using the formula for conditional probability, that would be P(Grand Prize and Prize) / P(Prize). But since winning the grand prize automatically means you won a prize, P(Grand Prize and Prize) is just P(Grand Prize). So, the probability simplifies to P(Grand Prize) / P(Prize).

So, I need to find both P(Grand Prize) and P(Prize). Let's start with P(Grand Prize). That's the probability that all four of Jen's numbers are chosen. Since the lottery is choosing 4 numbers out of 10, the total number of possible combinations is C(10,4). The number of favorable outcomes for the grand prize is just 1, because Jen has picked a specific set of 4 numbers. So, the probability is 1 / C(10,4).

Calculating C(10,4): 10! / (4! * (10-4)!) = (10*9*8*7)/(4*3*2*1) = 210. So, P(Grand Prize) is 1/210.

Next, we need to find P(Prize). That's the probability that at least two of her numbers are chosen. So, the prize is won if exactly two, exactly three, or exactly four of her numbers are chosen. So, we can calculate the probability of each of these events and sum them up.

Alternatively, sometimes it's easier to calculate the complement probability. The probability of NOT winning a prize is the probability that fewer than two of her numbers are chosen. That means zero or one of her numbers are among the chosen four. So, maybe we can calculate P(No prize) = P(0 or 1 of her numbers are chosen), and then subtract that from 1 to get P(Prize).

Let me think which approach is better. Since P(Prize) is the sum of three probabilities, while P(No prize) is the sum of two, sometimes the complement is easier, especially if the numbers are manageable.

So, let's compute P(No prize) first. P(No prize) = P(0 correct) + P(1 correct).

Calculating P(0 correct): The number of ways to choose 4 numbers from S that are none of Jen's numbers. Since Jen has 4 numbers, the remaining numbers are 10 - 4 = 6. So, the number of ways to choose 4 numbers from these 6 is C(6,4). So, the probability is C(6,4) / C(10,4).

Similarly, P(1 correct): The number of ways to choose exactly 1 of Jen's numbers and 3 from the remaining 6. So, that's C(4,1) * C(6,3). Thus, the probability is [C(4,1)*C(6,3)] / C(10,4).

So, let's compute these numbers.

First, C(6,4) is 15, right? Because 6!/(4!2!) = (6*5)/2 = 15. So, P(0 correct) = 15 / 210 = 1/14.

Next, C(4,1) is 4, and C(6,3) is 20. So, 4*20 = 80. Therefore, P(1 correct) = 80 / 210. Simplifying that, 80 and 210 are both divisible by 10: 8/21. Wait, no. 80/210 is 8/21 when simplified? Let me check: 80 divided by 10 is 8, 210 divided by 10 is 21. Yes, so 8/21. Wait, but 80/210 reduces to 8/21. So, that's correct.

So, P(No prize) = 15/210 + 80/210 = 95/210.

Therefore, P(Prize) = 1 - P(No prize) = 1 - 95/210 = (210 - 95)/210 = 115/210.

Simplify 115/210: both are divisible by 5. 115 รท5=23, 210 รท5=42. So, 23/42.

So, P(Prize) is 23/42.

Earlier, we found that P(Grand Prize) is 1/210.

So, the conditional probability P(Grand Prize | Prize) is (1/210) / (23/42) = (1/210) * (42/23) = (42)/(210*23).

Simplify 42/210: 42 divides into 210 5 times (since 42*5=210). So, 42/210 = 1/5. So, 1/5 * 1/23 = 1/115.

Wait, hold on. Wait, 42/210 is 1/5. So, 42/210 = 1/5, so (42)/(210*23) = (1/5) /23 = 1/(5*23) = 1/115.

Wait, that can't be right. Because 1/210 divided by 23/42 is equal to (1
