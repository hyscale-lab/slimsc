Alright, so I've got this problem with logarithms and three variables, x, y, and z. It's a system of equations, and I need to find the absolute value of log base 2 of x^4 y^3 z^2. Then, express that as a fraction m/n where m and n are coprime, and find m + n. Hmm, okay, let's break this down.

The equations given are:

1. log₂(x / (y z)) = 1/2
2. log₂(y / (x z)) = 1/3
3. log₂(z / (x y)) = 1/4

So, all of these are logarithms base 2. Since logarithms can be tricky, maybe I can rewrite each equation in exponential form to make it simpler. Remember, log_b(a) = c is equivalent to b^c = a.

Let's rewrite each equation:

1. 2^(1/2) = x / (y z)
2. 2^(1/3) = y / (x z)
3. 2^(1/4) = z / (x y)

Simplify the exponents:

1. sqrt(2) = x / (y z) → equation (1)
2. 2^(1/3) = y / (x z) → equation (2)
3. 2^(1/4) = z / (x y) → equation (3)

Hmm, now I have three equations with variables in the numerator and denominator. Maybe I can express x, y, z in terms of each other. Let me see.

From equation (1): x = sqrt(2) * y z.

From equation (2): y = 2^(1/3) * x z.

From equation (3): z = 2^(1/4) * x y.

Hmm, substituting might get messy, but let's try to express everything in terms of one variable. Let's see if I can substitute x from equation (1) into equation (2), then into equation (3).

From equation (1), x = sqrt(2) y z. Let's plug this into equation (2):

y = 2^(1/3) * (sqrt(2) y z) * z = 2^(1/3) * sqrt(2) * y z^2.

Wait, so y = [2^(1/3) * 2^(1/2)] y z^2.

Simplify the exponents: 2^(1/3 + 1/2) = 2^(5/6). So,

y = 2^(5/6) y z^2.

Hmm, I can divide both sides by y (since y is positive, so it's not zero):

1 = 2^(5/6) z^2.

So, z^2 = 1 / 2^(5/6) = 2^(-5/6).

Taking square roots:

z = 2^(-5/12). Because sqrt(2^(-5/6)) = 2^(-5/12). Since z is positive, we take the positive root.

Okay, so z is 2^(-5/12). Let me note that down.

Now, let's go back to equation (1): x = sqrt(2) * y z.

We have z = 2^(-5/12), so let's plug that in:

x = 2^(1/2) * y * 2^(-5/12) = y * 2^(1/2 - 5/12).

Compute the exponent: 1/2 is 6/12, so 6/12 -5/12 = 1/12.

So, x = y * 2^(1/12). So, x = y * 2^(1/12). Let's keep that in mind.

Now, let's go to equation (2): y = 2^(1/3) * x z.

We already have x in terms of y, so substitute x:

y = 2^(1/3) * (y * 2^(1/12)) * z.

We also know z is 2^(-5/12), so plug that in:

y = 2^(1/3) * y * 2^(1/12) * 2^(-5/12).

Combine the exponents:

2^(1/3) * 2^(1/12 -5/12) = 2^(1/3) * 2^(-4/12) = 2^(1/3) * 2^(-1/3) = 2^(0) = 1.

So, y = 1 * y → y = y.

Wait, that just gives an identity. Hmm, that doesn't help me find y. Maybe I need to try a different approach.

Alternatively, maybe I can express all variables in terms of each other and then set up a system.

We have:

From equation (1): x = 2^(1/2) y z → equation (1a)

From equation (2): y = 2^(1/3) x z → equation (2a)

From equation (3): z = 2^(1/4) x y → equation (3a)

Let me substitute equation (1a) into equation (2a):

y = 2^(1/3) * (2^(1/2) y z) * z = 2^(1/3 + 1/2) y z^2.

Which is similar to what I did earlier, leading to z^2 = 2^(-5/6), so z=2^(-5/12). So, maybe I can then substitute z into equation (3a) to find x and y.

Wait, equation (3a) is z = 2^(1/4) x y. We know z is 2^(-5/12), so:

2^(-5/12) = 2^(1/4) x y.

Let me compute 2^(1/4) as 2^(3/12), and 2^(-5/12) is as is. So,

x y = [2^(-5/12)] / [2^(3/12)] = 2^(-8/12) = 2^(-2/3).

So, x y = 2^(-2/3). Equation (4).

From equation (1a): x = 2^(1/2) y z.

We know z is 2^(-5/12), so x = 2^(1/2) y * 2^(-5/12) = y * 2^(1/2 -5/12).

Compute exponent: 1/2 is 6/12, so 6/12 -5/12=1/12. So,

x = y * 2^(1/12). So, equation (1b): x = y * 2^(1/12).

Now, equation (4): x y = 2^(-2/3). Substitute x from (1b):

(y * 2^(1/12)) * y = 2^(-2/3). So,

y^2 * 2^(1/12) = 2^(-2/3).

Divide both sides by 2^(1/12):

y^2 = 2^(-2/3 - 1/12) = 2^(-8/12 -1/12)=2^(-9/12)=2^(-3/4).

So, y^2=2^(-3/4) → y=2^(-3/8), since y is positive.

So, y=2^(-3/8).

Then, from equation (1b): x= y *2^(1/12)=2^(-3/8) *2^(1/12)=2^(-3/8 +1/12).

Compute the exponent: -3/8 is -9/24, 1/12 is 2/24. So, -9/24 +2/24= -7/24.

Thus, x=2^(-7/24).

We already have z=2^(-5/12)=2^(-10/24).

So, now, x=2^(-7/24), y=2^(-3/8)=2^(-9/24), z=2^(-10/24).

Hmm, let me note all exponents with denominator 24 to make it easier:

x=2^(-7/24), y=2^(-9/24), z=2^(-10/24).

Now, the problem asks for |log₂(x⁴ y³ z²)|.

Let's compute x⁴ y³ z².

x⁴ = (2^(-7/24))^4 = 2^(-28/24) = 2^(-7/6).

y³ = (2^(-9/24))^3 = 2^(-27/24) = 2^(-9/8).

z² = (2^(-10/24))^2 = 2^(-20/24) = 2^(-5/6).

Multiply all together:

x⁴ y³ z² = 2^(-7/6) * 2^(-9/8) * 2^(-5/6).

Add the exponents:

-7/6 -9/8 -5/6.

First, common denominator is 24.

Convert each:

-7/6 = -28/24,

-9/8 = -27/24,

-5/6 = -20/24.

Adding: -28 -27 -20 = -75. So, -75/24.

Simplify: -75/24 = -25/8.

So, x⁴ y³ z² = 2^(-25/8).

Taking log base 2 of that:

log₂(2^(-25/8)) = -25/8.

The absolute value is | -25/8 | =25/8.

So, 25 and 8 are coprime, so m=25, n=8. m +n=33.

Wait, let me check my calculations again.

Wait, x=2^(-7/24). So, x⁴ is (2^(-7/24))^4 = 2^(-28/24)=2^(-7/6). Correct.

y=2^(-9/24)=2^(-3/8). y³=2^(-9/8). Correct.

z=2^(-10/24)=2^(-5/12). Wait, wait a second. Wait, z=2^(-5/12). So, z²=2
