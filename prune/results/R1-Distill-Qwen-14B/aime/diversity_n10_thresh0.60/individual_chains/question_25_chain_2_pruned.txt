Okay, so I'm trying to solve this math problem about residents in Aimeville and the things they own. Let me read through the problem again and make sure I understand all the details.

Alright, there are 900 residents in total. Each of them owns a bag of candy hearts. So, that's one thing that everyone has. Then, there are three other items: diamond rings, golf clubs, and garden spades. The numbers are 195, 367, and 562 respectively. 

Wait, so 195 people own a diamond ring, 367 own golf clubs, and 562 own a garden spade. Also, each resident owns at least a bag of candy hearts, so that's four items in total if they have all four. But the problem says that there are 437 residents who own exactly two of these things and 234 who own exactly three. We're supposed to find how many own all four.

Hmm, this sounds like a problem involving sets and maybe using the principle of inclusion-exclusion. I remember that inclusion-exclusion helps calculate the union of multiple sets by adding and subtracting overlaps. But in this case, since each person can have multiple items, and we have information about exactly two and exactly three, perhaps I can model this with a Venn diagram approach.

Let me think about the variables. Let me denote:

- Let A be the set of people who own a diamond ring.
- Let B be the set of people who own a set of golf clubs.
- Let C be the set of people who own a garden spade.
- Let D be the set of people who own a bag of candy hearts.

Since everyone owns D, the bag of candy hearts, D is the universal set here. So, every resident is in D. So, the total number of people is 900, so |D| = 900.

The problem gives me the counts for A, B, and C:
- |A| = 195
- |B| = 367
- |C| = 562

We also know that 437 people own exactly two of these things, and 234 own exactly three. So, the problem is about figuring out how many own all four, which would be |A ∩ B ∩ C ∩ D|. But since D is universal, it's the same as |A ∩ B ∩ C|.

Wait, no. Because owning all four would mean they have A, B, C, and D. But since D is already included in everyone, the count for all four is just the people who have A, B, C, and D. But since D is everyone, that's just |A ∩ B ∩ C|.

So, the problem is to find |A ∩ B ∩ C|, which is the number of people who have all three of A, B, and C, and since everyone has D, that's all four.

So, how do we approach this? I think inclusion-exclusion can help, but we have to account for the exact numbers of people owning two and three items.

Let me recall that the formula for the union of three sets is:

|A ∪ B ∪ C| = |A| + |B| + |C| - |A ∩ B| - |A ∩ C| - |B ∩ C| + |A ∩ B ∩ C|

But in this case, since D is universal, and everyone is in D, the total number of people in A ∪ B ∪ C is equal to |D|, which is 900. Wait, no. Because A, B, C are subsets of D, but the union of A, B, C would include all people who have at least one of A, B, or C. But since everyone has D, does that mean that the union of A, B, C is equal to D? Because everyone in D has D, but may have other things. Hmm, not necessarily.

Wait, no. Let me clarify. Wait, the problem says that each resident owns a
