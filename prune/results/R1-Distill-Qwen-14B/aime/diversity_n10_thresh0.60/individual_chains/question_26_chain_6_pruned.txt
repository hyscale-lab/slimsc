Okay, so I've got this geometry problem here, and I need to find the length of AP in triangle ABC inscribed in a circle ω. The tangents at B and C meet at point D, and AD intersects ω again at P. Given sides AB=5, BC=9, AC=10, I need to express AP as m/n where m and n are coprime, then find m + n.

Hmm, let me visualize the problem first. Triangle ABC with sides AB=5, BC=9, AC=10. So, it's a scalene triangle. The circle ω is the circumcircle of ABC. Tangents at B and C meet at D. Then, line AD meets ω again at P. So, AP is the segment from A to P on AD, and I need to find its length.

I remember that when two tangents are drawn from a point to a circle, they're equal in length. So, DB = DC. That might come in handy somewhere.

First, maybe I can find some lengths in triangle ABC. Since I know all three sides, perhaps I can find the circumradius or some angles. Alternatively, maybe using power of a point from point D with respect to ω.

Wait, point D is the intersection of the two tangents, so by the power of point D with respect to ω, we have DB² = DC² = DA * DP. Because AD is a secant line that meets the circle at A and P, so the power of D would relate DA and DP.

Let me write that down: DB² = DA * DP.

But I don't know DB or DA yet. Hmm. Maybe I can find DB using triangle ABC's sides.

Wait, how can I find DB? Since DB is the tangent from D to ω, and D is the exsimilicenter or something? Or maybe I can find coordinates.

Alternatively, perhaps using coordinate geometry could help. Let me consider placing triangle ABC in a coordinate system to make calculations easier. Let me put point C at the origin (0,0), point A at (10,0) because AC is 10 units. Then point B would be somewhere in the plane—I need to find its coordinates.

Wait, AB is 5, BC is 9, and AC is 10. So, coordinates: Let A be at (10,0), C at (0,0). Let B be at (x,y). Then, distance from A to B is 5: sqrt((x-10)^2 + y^2) = 5, so (x-10)^2 + y^2 =25.

Distance from B to C is 9: sqrt(x² + y²) =9, so x² + y² =81.

So, subtracting the first equation from the second: x² + y² - [(x-10)^2 + y^2] =81 -25 → x² - (x² -20x +100) =56 → 20x -100 =56 →20x=156 →x=156/20=39/5=7.8.

So x=7.8, which is 39/5. Then, plug back to find y.

From x² + y²=81: (39/5)^2 + y²=81.

Calculate 39^2: 1521, so (1521/25) + y²=81.

81 is 2025/25. So y²=2025/25 -1521/25=(2025-1521)/25=504/25. So y= sqrt(504)/5.

Simplify sqrt(504): 504=16*31.5? Wait, 504=16*31.
