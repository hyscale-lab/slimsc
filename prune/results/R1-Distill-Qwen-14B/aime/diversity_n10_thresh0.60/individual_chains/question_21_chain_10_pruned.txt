Okay, so I've got this problem here about something called "b-eautiful" numbers. Let me try to understand it step by step. 

The problem says that for a given integer b (which is at least 2), a positive integer n is called b-eautiful if two conditions are met. First, when n is expressed in base b, it has exactly two digits. Second, the sum of these two digits equals the square root of n. 

Let me restate that to make sure I get it. So n is a two-digit number in base b. That means in base 10, n would be equal to some value a*b + c, where a and c are the digits in base b. Also, a and c must satisfy a + c = sqrt(n). 

They gave an example: 81 is 13-eautiful because in base 13, 81 is written as 63 (which is 6*13 + 3), and 6 + 3 equals 9, which is sqrt(81). So that makes sense. 

The question is asking for the least integer b (where b is at least 2) for which there are more than ten b-eautiful integers. So I need to find the smallest b such that there are more than ten numbers n that satisfy the b-eautiful condition.

Alright, so let's break this down. Let's denote the two digits in base b as a and c. Since it's a two-digit number in base b, the first digit a can't be zero, right? Because then it would be a single-digit number. So a must be at least 1, and since in base b, the digits go from 0 to b-1, a can be from 1 to b-1, and c can be from 0 to b-1.

So the number n in base 10 is n = a*b + c. 

The condition is that a + c = sqrt(n). Let's write that as an equation: a + c = sqrt(a*b + c). Let's square both sides to get rid of the square root: (a + c)^2 = a*b + c.

Let me expand the left side: a^2 + 2*a*c + c^2 = a*b + c.

Now, let's rearrange this equation: a^2 + 2*a*c + c^2 - a*b - c = 0.

Hmm, maybe I can group terms to make this easier. Let's see:

a^2 - a*b + 2*a*c + c^2 - c = 0.

Let me factor terms where possible:

a(a - b) + c(2a + c - 1) = 0.

Hmm, not sure if that helps. Maybe another approach. Let's consider the equation (a + c)^2 = a*b + c.

We can write this as (a + c)^2 - c = a*b.

So, b = [(a + c)^2 - c]/a.

Since b must be an integer greater than or equal to 2, this expression must yield an integer. So [(a + c)^2 - c] must be divisible by a. 

Let me denote s = a + c. So the equation becomes b = (s^2 - c)/a.

But since s = a + c, we can write c = s - a. Substitute that into the equation for b:

b = (s^2 - (s - a))/a.

Let me simplify this:

b = (s^2 - s + a)/a.

Breaking it down:

b = (s^2 - s)/a + a/a.

Which is:

b = (s^2 - s)/a + 1.

So, b = (s^2 - s)/a + 1.

Since b must be an integer, (s^2 - s)/a must be an integer as well. So a must divide (s^2 - s). 

Alternatively, a divides s^2 - s.

But s is a + c, which is equal to sqrt(n), and since n is a two-digit number in base b, n must be between b and b^2 - 1. So sqrt(n) must be between sqrt(b) and sqrt(b^2 - 1), which is between approximately sqrt(b) and b. So s must be in that range. 

Wait, but s = a + c, and a is at least 1, c is at least 0, so s is at least 1 and at most (b-1) + (b-1) = 2b - 2. But since n is two digits in base b, n is less than b^2, so sqrt(n) is less than b. So s must be less than b. So s is in the range 1 <= s < b.

Also, s must be an integer because a and c are integers, so their sum s is also an integer.

So s can be from 1 to b - 1. But since a is at least 1 and c is at least 0, s is at least 1, and since a is at most b-1 and c is at most b-1, s is at most 2b - 2, but since s must be less than b, s is up to b-1.

So s ranges from 1 to b-1.

Now, for each s in this range, we can find the possible a and c such that s = a + c, and a divides s^2 - s.

Let me think about it. For each s, find a such that a divides s^2 - s, and a is between 1 and s (since a <= s because c = s - a >= 0).

So for each s, the possible a's are the divisors of s(s - 1) that are less than or equal to s.

Because s^2 - s = s(s - 1), so a must divide s(s - 1). So a is a divisor of s(s - 1), and a <= s.

So for each possible s (from 1 to b-1), we can find all a that divides s(s - 1) and a <= s. For each such a, c = s - a, and then check if c is a valid digit in base b (i.e., c < b).

Wait, but s is less than b, so c = s - a is less than s, which is less than b. So as long as a is a positive integer and c is non-negative, which it
