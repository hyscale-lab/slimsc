Okay, so I've got this math problem here about Aya's morning walk and coffee shop visits. Let me try to work through it step by step. I'm a bit nervous because word problems can get tricky, but I'll take it slow.

First, let me parse the problem. Aya walks 9 kilometers every morning. She goes at a constant speed, which is given as 's' kilometers per hour. Depending on her walking speed, the time it takes her varies, and each time, she spends 't' minutes in the coffee shop. The problem gives me two different scenarios with different speeds and times, and then asks me to find the total time taken when she walks at s + 1/2 km/h.

Hmm, okay, so I think I need to set up some equations based on the information provided. Let me jot down what I know:

1. When she walks at speed 's' km/h, the total time is 4 hours, which includes 't' minutes in the coffee shop. Wait, but time is in hours and minutes. I should probably convert everything to the same unit to avoid confusion.

2. When she walks at speed 's + 2' km/h, the total time is 2 hours and 24 minutes, also including 't' minutes in the coffee shop.

So, the key here is that the time she spends walking changes with speed, but the coffee shop time 't' remains the same in both cases. Therefore, the difference in total time must be due to the difference in walking time. The coffee shop time is the same, so when calculating, I can subtract the coffee shop time to find the actual walking time for each scenario.

Let me think about this. The total time is walking time plus coffee shop time. So, for the first scenario:

Walking speed = s km/h
Total time = 4 hours = 4*60 = 240 minutes
Coffee shop time = t minutes
So, walking time = 240 - t minutes.

Similarly, for the second scenario:
Walking speed = s + 2 km/h
Total time = 2 hours and 24 minutes = (2*60) +24 = 144 minutes.
So, walking time = 144 - t minutes.

But we also know that walking time is equal to distance divided by speed. The distance is 9 km in both cases. So:

For the first case: Walking time (in hours) = 9 / s hours.
But wait, I have walking time in minutes from the total time. Hmm.

Wait, maybe it's better to convert everything into hours. Let me try that.

First scenario:
Total time = 4 hours = 4 hours
Coffee shop time = t minutes = t/60 hours
Walking time = 4 - (t/60) hours.

Walking speed = s km/h, so walking time = 9 / s hours.

Therefore, 9/s = 4 - (t/60). Equation 1.

Second scenario:
Total time = 2 hours 24 minutes = 2 + 24/60 = 2.4 hours.
Coffee shop time = t/60 hours.
Walking time = 2.4 - (t/60) hours.

Walking speed = s + 2 km/h, so walking time = 9 / (s + 2) hours.

So, 9/(s + 2) = 2.4 - (t/60). Equation 2.

Now, I have two equations:

1. 9/s = 4 - (t/60)
2. 9/(s + 2) = 2.4 - (t/60)

I can set up these equations and solve for s and t.

Let me write them again:

Equation 1: 9/s = 4 - (t/60)
Equation 2: 9/(s + 2) = 2.4 - (t/60)

I can subtract t/60 from both equations. Let me denote t/60 as something to make it easier. Let me let x = t/60. Then, t = 60x.

So, substituting into the equations:

Equation 1: 9/s = 4 - x
Equation 2: 9/(s + 2) = 2.4 - x

So now, I have:

9/s = 4 - x
and
9/(s + 2) = 2.4 - x

Let me rearrange both equations to express x in terms of s.

From Equation 1: x = 4 - (9/s)
From Equation 2: x = 2.4 - (9/(s + 2))

Since both equal x, I can set them equal to each other:

4 - (9/s) = 2.4 - (9/(s + 2))

Now, let's solve for s.

First, bring like terms together:

4 - 2.4 = (9/s) - (9/(s + 2))

Which simplifies to:

1.6 = 9/s - 9/(s + 2)

I can factor out the 9:

1.6 = 9*(1/s - 1/(s + 2))

Let me compute 1/s - 1/(s + 2):

1/s - 1/(s + 2) = [ (s + 2) - s ] / [s(s + 2)] = 2 / [s(s + 2)]

So, substituting back:

1.6 = 9*(2)/(s(s + 2)) = 18/(s(s + 2))

So,

1.6 = 18/(s(s + 2))

Let me write this as:

s(s + 2) = 18 / 1.6

18 divided by 1.6. Let me compute that.

18 / 1.6 = same as 180 / 16 = 45/4 = 11.25.

So,

s(s + 2) = 11.25

Which is a quadratic equation:

s^2 + 2s - 11.25 = 0

Let me write it as:

s² + 2s - 11.25 = 0

To solve this quadratic equation, I can use the quadratic formula. The quadratic is in the form a s² + b s + c = 0, where a=1, b=2, c=-11.25.

The quadratic formula gives:

s = [ -b ± sqrt(b² - 4ac) ] / (2a)

Plugging in the values:

s = [ -2 ± sqrt( (2)^2 - 4 *1*(-11.25) ) ] / (2*1)
s = [ -2 ± sqrt(4 + 45) ] / 2
Because 4 *1*11.25 is 45, so 4 + 45 is 49.

So,

s = [ -2 ± sqrt(49) ] / 2
sqrt(49) is 7, so:

s = [ -2 ±7 ] / 2

So, two possible solutions:

s = ( -2 +7 ) / 2 = 5 / 2 = 2.5
s = ( -2 -7 ) / 2 = -9/2 = -4.5

But speed can't be negative, so s = 2.5 km/h.

Wait, that seems a bit slow for a walk, but okay, maybe it's okay. So, s=2.5 km/h.

Now, let's find x, which is t/60.

From Equation 1: x = 4 - 9/s.

s=2.5, so 9/2.5 = 3.6

So, x = 4 - 3.6 = 0.4

So, x=0
