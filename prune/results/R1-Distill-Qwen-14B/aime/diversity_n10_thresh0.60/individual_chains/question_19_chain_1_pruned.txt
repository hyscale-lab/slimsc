Okay, so I've got this geometry problem here about triangle ABC. It says that the circumcenter is O and the incenter is I. The line IA is perpendicular to OI. The circumradius is 13, and the inradius is 6. I need to find the product AB times AC. Hmm, okay, let's break this down.

First, I remember that in a triangle, the circumradius R is related to the sides and the area. The formula I recall is that the area can be expressed as (a*b*c)/(4R), where a, b, c are the sides. Also, the inradius r is related to the area and the semiperimeter: area = r*s, where s is the semiperimeter.

So, given R = 13 and r = 6, maybe I can use these two formulas together. Let me write them down:

Area = (a*b*c)/(4*13) = (a*b*c)/52,

and

Area = 6*s, where s = (a + b + c)/2.

So, setting these equal: (a*b*c)/52 = 6*s. Hmm, not sure if that's immediately helpful, but I'll keep that in mind.

Now, the problem also mentions that IA is perpendicular to OI. That seems important. I wonder how to use that. I think in a triangle, the incenter I and the circumcenter O have specific relationships. Maybe I can use coordinate geometry or vector methods, but that might get complicated. Alternatively, maybe some properties or theorems can help.

Wait, I remember that in some cases, the inradius and the circumradius can be related through other elements of the triangle. Also, maybe the fact that IA is perpendicular to OI gives a right angle condition which can be used with some formulas.

Let me think about the positions of O and I. In any triangle, the distance between the incenter and circumcenter is given by the formula OI = sqrt(R(R - 2r)), where R is the circumradius and r is the inradius. Is that correct? Let me check the formula.

Yes, I think that's correct. OI squared equals R squared minus 2Rr. So, OI² = R² - 2Rr.

Given R = 13 and r = 6, OI² = 13² - 2*13*6.

Calculating that: 13² is 169, 2*13*6 is 156, so 169 - 156 is 13. So, OI² = 13, so OI is sqrt(13). Hmm, okay.

Now, IA is perpendicular to OI. Let me visualize this. IA is a segment from incenter I to vertex A, and OI is the segment from incenter to circumradius. Wait, no, OI is from circumcenter O to incenter I.

Wait, so IA is perpendicular to OI. So, in triangle IOA, angle at I is 90 degrees. So triangle IOA is right-angled at I.

So, in triangle IOA, we have a right triangle with legs IO and IA, and hypotenuse OA.

We know that OA is the circumradius, which is 13. Because O is the circumcenter, so OA is equal to OB and OC, all equal to R = 13.

We found OI is sqrt(13), and IA is the length from incenter I to vertex A. So, in the right triangle IOA, by Pythagoras:

OA² = OI² + IA².

So, 13² = (sqrt(13))² + IA².

13² is 169, sqrt(13)² is 13, so 169 = 13 + IA².

Subtracting, IA² = 169 -13 = 156, so IA = sqrt(156). Simplify sqrt(156): 156 = 4*39, so sqrt(4*39) = 2*sqrt(39). So IA is 2√39. Okay, so IA = 2√39.

Hmm, so now I have IA. What does IA represent? IA is the length from the inradius to vertex A. I think there's a formula for the distance from the incenter to a vertex.

Wait, the distance from the incenter to vertex A can be expressed in terms of the triangle's angles and sides. I recall that in a triangle, the distance from the incenter to A is given by IA = (r)/sin(A/2). Is that right?

Let me think. The inradius formula is r = (Area)/s, where s is the semiperimeter. Also, in terms of the angles, I remember that the distance from the incenter to a vertex can be expressed using trigonometric functions.

Alternatively, maybe I can write IA in terms of the sides. Let me think.

Wait, in triangle ABC,
