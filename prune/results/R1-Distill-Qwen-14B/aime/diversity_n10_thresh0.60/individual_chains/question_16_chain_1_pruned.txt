Okay, so I have this math problem here. Let me try to understand it step by step. The problem says:

Let \( p \) be the least prime number for which there exists a positive integer \( n \) such that \( n^4 + 1 \) is divisible by \( p^2 \). Find the least positive integer \( m \) such that \( m^4 + 1 \) is divisible by \( p^2 \).

Hmm, so first, I need to find the smallest prime \( p \) such that \( p^2 \) divides \( n^4 + 1 \) for some positive integer \( n \). Once I find that \( p \), I have to find the smallest \( m \) such that \( m^4 + 1 \) is divisible by \( p^2 \).

Alright, let me break it down. I think I should start by considering small primes and checking whether \( n^4 + 1 \) is divisible by \( p^2 \) for some \( n \).

Let me list the primes in order: 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, etc.

First, check \( p = 2 \).

Does there exist an \( n \) such that \( n^4 + 1 \) is divisible by \( 2^2 = 4 \)?

Let's compute \( n^4 + 1 \) modulo 4 for various \( n \).

Since \( n \) is a positive integer, it can be either even or odd.

If \( n \) is even, say \( n = 2k \), then \( n^4 = (2k)^4 = 16k^4 \), which is 0 mod 4. So \( n^4 + 1 \) is 1 mod 4.

If \( n \) is odd, say \( n = 2k + 1 \), then \( n^4 = (2k+1)^4 \). Let's compute it mod 4.

\( (2k+1)^2 = 4k^2 + 4k + 1 \equiv 1 \mod 4 \).
So \( (2k+1)^4 = [(2k+1)^2]^2 \equiv 1^2 = 1 \mod 4 \).
Thus, \( n^4 + 1 \equiv 1 + 1 = 2 \mod 4 \).

So for \( p = 2 \), \( n^4 + 1 \) is either 1 or 2 mod 4, never 0. So 4 doesn't divide \( n^4 + 1 \) for any \( n \). Therefore, \( p = 2 \) is not the prime we're looking for.

Next, check \( p = 3 \).

We need to find if there's an \( n \) such that \( n^4 + 1 \equiv 0 \mod 9 \).

Compute \( n^4 \) mod 9 for \( n = 1 \) to 8 (since mod 9 cycles every 9 numbers).

Let's compute:

\( n = 1: 1^4 = 1 \mod 9 \)
\( n = 2: 2^4 = 16 \mod 9 = 7 \)
\( n = 3: 0 \mod 9 \)
\( n = 4: 4^4 = 256 \mod 9 \). Let's compute 256 /9: 9*28=252, 256-252=4. So 4 mod 9.
\( n = 5: 5^4 = 625. 625 /9: 9*69=621, 625-621=4. So 625 mod9=4? Wait, wait, 5 mod9 is5, 5^2=25 mod9=7, 5^4=(5^2)^2=7^2=49 mod9=4. Yeah, same as 4.
\( n=6: 6^4=1296 mod9. 1296/9=144, so 0 mod9.
\( n=7: 7 mod9. 7^2=49 mod9=4. 7^4=(7^2)^2=4^2=16 mod9=7.
n=8: 8 mod9=8. 8^2=64 mod9=1. 8^4=(8^2)^2=1^2=1 mod9.

So, the results are:

n : 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8

n^4 mod9:1,7,0,4,4,0,7,1.

So, \( n^4 +1 \) mod9 for these n:

n=1: 1+1=2 mod9
n=2:7+1=8 mod9
n=3:0+1=1 mod9
n=4:4+1=5 mod9
n=5:4+1=5 mod9
n=6:0+1=1 mod9
n=7:7+1=8 mod9
n=8:1+1=2 mod9.

None of these are 0 mod9. So, for p=3, there's no n such that n^4 +1 is divisible by 9. So p=3 is out.

Next, p=5.

Check if there exists n such that n^4 +1 ≡0 mod25.

So, n^4 ≡ -1 mod25.

Hmm, let's compute n^4 mod25 for n=1 to 24, but perhaps there's a smarter way.

Alternatively, since 25 is 5 squared, and 5 is prime, perhaps we can use some number theory here.

Firstly, in mod5, n^4 ≡0 or 1 mod5, because by Fermat's little theorem, for n not divisible by 5, n^4 ≡1 mod5.

So for n not divisible by 5, n^4 ≡1 mod5, so n^4 +1 ≡2 mod5. Which is not 0.

If n is divisible by 5, then n^4 ≡0 mod25, so n^4 +1 ≡1 mod25, which is not 0.

So, if n is divisible by 5, n^4 +1 ≡1 mod25.

If n is not divisible by 5, n^4 +1 ≡2 mod5, so can't be 0 mod5, hence can't be 0 mod25.

Wait, so n^4 +1 can't be divisible by5, let alone 25.

Wait, that can't be. Wait, let's compute for n=1: 1 +1=2 mod5.

n=2: 16 +1=17≡2 mod5.

Wait, n=3:81 +1=82≡2 mod5.

n=4:256 +1=257≡2 mod5.

n=5:0 +1=1 mod5.

So indeed, n^4 +1 is either 1 or 2 mod5, so never 0 mod5. Thus, 5 can't divide n^4 +1, so 25 can't either. So p=5 is out.

Next prime is 7.

So check if there exists n such that n^4 +1≡0 mod49.

So n^4 ≡-1 mod49.

Again, let's first check mod7, since 49 is 7 squared.

n^4 mod7:

By Fermat's little theorem, for n not divisible by7, n^6≡1 mod7, so n^4 =n^{-2} mod7.

So compute n^4 mod7 for n=1 to6:

n=1:1^4=1

n=2:16 mod7=2

n=3:81 mod7=81-11*7=81-77=4

n=4:256 mod7. 256 /7: 7*36=252, 256-252=4. So 4 mod7.

n=5:625 mod7. 625 - 7*89=625-623=2 mod7.

n=6:1296 mod7. Let's see, 7*185=1295, so 1296 mod7=1.

So n^4 mod7:

n:1 2 3 4 5 6

n^4 mod7:1,2,4,4,2,1.

So, n^4 +1 mod7:

n:1→2,2→3,3→5,4→5,5→3,6→2.

So n^4 +1 is either 2,3,5 mod7. So it's never 0 mod7. Therefore, n^4 +1 is not divisible by7, so certainly not by49. Therefore, p=7 is out.

Next prime:11.

Wait, before that, maybe I should check p=13 or p=17. Wait, perhaps I should check p=17 as I remember that 2^4 +1 =17. But wait, perhaps it's better to proceed step by step.
