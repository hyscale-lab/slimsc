Okay, so I have this math problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me start by reading it again carefully.

The problem says: Let p be the least prime number for which there exists a positive integer n such that n⁴ + 1 is divisible by p². Then, I need to find the least positive integer m such that m⁴ + 1 is divisible by p². So, essentially, I'm looking for the smallest prime p where p² divides some n⁴ + 1, and then the smallest m with the same property.

Alright, let's break this down. First, find the smallest prime p where p² divides n⁴ + 1 for some n. Then, find the smallest m such that m⁴ + 1 is divisible by p².

I remember that primes for which -1 is a quartic residue are important here. A quartic residue modulo p means that there exists some x such that x⁴ ≡ -1 mod p. But for p², it's not just modulo p, but modulo p². So, the equation x⁴ ≡ -1 mod p² must have a solution.

I think the first step is to find the smallest prime p where this is possible. So, I'll need to check primes starting from the smallest ones and see if p² divides some n⁴ + 1.

Let me list the primes in order: 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, etc. Let me check each one to see if there exists an n such that n⁴ + 1 is divisible by p².

Starting with p=2. Let's see: n⁴ +1. For n=1, 1 +1=2, which is 2^1, not 2^2. For n=2, 16 +1=17, which isn't divisible by 4. Hmm, wait, n=1 gives 2, n=2 gives 17, n=3: 81 +1=82, which is 2*41, so 82 is divisible by 2 but not by 4. So, 2²=4 doesn't divide any n⁴+1? Wait, n=0: 0 +1=1, which isn't divisible by 4. So, maybe p=2 is not possible. So, p=2 is out.

Next, p=3. Check if there's an n such that n⁴ +1 ≡0 mod 9. Let's compute n⁴ modulo 9 for n from 0 to 8.

Compute n⁴ mod 9:

n=0: 0⁴=0 mod9
n=1:1 mod9
n=2:16 mod9=7
n=3:81 mod9=0
n=4:4⁴=256 mod9. 256 divided by 9 is 28*9=252, remainder 4. So 4 mod9.
n=5:5⁴=625. 625 /9: 69*9=621, rem 4. So 4 mod9.
n=6:6⁴=1296 mod9=0
n=7:7⁴=2401. 2401 /9: 266*9=2394, rem 7. So 7 mod9.
n=8:8⁴=4096. 4096 /9: 455*9=4095, rem 1. So 1 mod9.

So the possible n⁴ mod9 are 0,1,4,7. So, n⁴ +1 mod9 can be 1,2,5,8. None of these are 0 mod9, meaning 3²=9 does not divide any n⁴ +1. So p=3 is out.

Next, p=5. Let's check if there's an n with n⁴ +1 ≡0 mod25.

Compute n⁴ mod25 for n from 0 to 24. But maybe there's a smarter way. Instead, I can look for x such that x⁴ ≡ -1 mod25. So, find x where x⁴ ≡24 mod25.

Let me compute x⁴ mod25 for x from 1 to 12, since beyond that, it's symmetric.

x=1:1
x=2:16
x=3:81 mod25=6
x=4:256 mod25=6 (since 25*10=250, 256-250=6)
Wait, 4⁴ is 256, which is 6 mod25.

x=5:0 mod25.
x=6:6⁴=1296. 1296/25=51*25=1275, rem 21. So 21 mod25.
x=7:7⁴=2401. 2401/25=96*25=2400, rem 1. So 1 mod25.
x=8:8⁴=4096. 4096 - 163*25=4096-
