Okay, so I need to figure out how many paths of length 16 on an 8x8 grid change direction exactly four times. Hmm, let me start by understanding the problem better.

First, let me visualize the grid. It's an 8x8 grid, which means there are 8 rows and 8 columns, right? So, moving from the lower left corner to the upper right corner would require moving right and up. Since it's an 8x8 grid, the number of steps needed would be 8 to the right and 8 up, totaling 16 steps. That makes sense because the path's length is 16. 

Now, each path is a sequence of moves: either right (R) or up (U). So, the total number of such paths without any restrictions would be the number of ways to arrange 8 R's and 8 U's. That's a combination problem, and the formula would be C(16,8), which is 12870. But wait, the problem is asking for paths that change direction exactly four times. So, I can't just use that straightforward combination.

Changing direction exactly four times means that the path has exactly four points where it switches from moving right to up or up to right. Each direction change signifies a new segment in the path. So, if I have four direction changes, how many segments does that make? Let's see: starting with one direction, each change adds a new segment. So, four changes would result in five segments. For example, if I start by moving right, then up, then right, then up, etc., each time I change direction, I add another segment. So, four changes mean five segments in total.

Each segment must consist of at least one step, right? Because otherwise, if a segment had zero steps, that would imply an unnecessary direction change. So, each segment must have at least one step. Therefore, the path is divided into five segments, each with at least one step. Now, these steps can be either all right or all up, depending on the direction of that segment.

Since we have five segments and we need to cover 8 right steps and 8 up steps, let's model this. Let's denote the number of right segments as k, then the number of up segments would be 5 - k. But wait, actually, because the path starts with either a right or up move, but in our case, the grid is from lower left to upper right, so the path should start with a right or up move. Wait, but in an 8x8 grid, starting with right or starting with up is possible, but since direction changes can happen, the path could start with either.

But wait, actually, in an 8x8 grid, the starting point is (0,0) and the ending point is (8,8). So, any path must consist of a combination of right and up moves. So, the first move can be right or up. So, the number of right segments and up segments can vary.

But for the purpose of counting, maybe it's better to separate the cases where the path starts with a right move and where it starts with an up move. Because the number of direction changes may differ depending on the starting direction.

Wait, no. Because direction changes are counted regardless of the direction. So, starting with right or up just affects the
