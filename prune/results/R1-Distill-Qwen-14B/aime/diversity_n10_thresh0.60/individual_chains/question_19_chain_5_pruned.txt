Okay, so I have this geometry problem here. Let me read it again and try to figure out what I need to do.

The problem says: Let triangle ABC have circumcenter O and incenter I with IA perpendicular to OI. The circumradius is 13, and the inradius is 6. I need to find AB multiplied by AC, so AB·AC.

Hmm, okay. Let me jot down what I know.

1. Triangle ABC with circumradius R = 13 and inradius r = 6.
2. The incenter I and the circumcenter O are such that IA is perpendicular to OI.
3. Find AB·AC.

I think I should start by recalling some properties of triangle centers and maybe some formulas that relate inradius, circumradius, and other elements of the triangle.

First, I remember that the inradius r is related to the area (Δ) and the semiperimeter (s) by the formula:

r = Δ / s

And the circumradius R is related to the sides a, b, c by the formula:

R = (a b c) / (4 Δ)

But I don't know the sides yet. So maybe I can find expressions that relate these.

I also remember that the distance between the incenter and circumcenter (OI) can be found using the formula:

OI² = R(R - 2r)

Wait, does this apply here? Let me think. Yes, I think that's a standard formula when the triangle isn't necessarily equilateral or anything. So OI² = R(R - 2r). Let me compute that.

Given R = 13 and r = 6, so OI² = 13*(13 - 2*6) = 13*(13 - 12) = 13*1 = 13. So OI = sqrt(13). Okay, that's a useful value.

Now, the problem states that IA is perpendicular to OI. So, in triangle IOA, angle at I is 90 degrees. So triangle IOA is right-angled at I.

In a right triangle, the Pythagorean theorem applies. So, in triangle IOA:

OA² = IO² + IA²

But OA is the circumradius, which is R = 13. So,

13² = (sqrt(13))² + IA²
169 = 13 + IA²
IA² = 169 -13 = 156
So IA = sqrt(156) = sqrt(4*39) = 2*sqrt(39)

Alright, so IA is 2√39.

Now, I remember that the length of the inradius can be related to the distances from the incenter to the vertices. Wait, but IA is the length from the incenter I to vertex A, which is not the inradius. The inradius is the distance from I to any side, not to the vertices.

So IA is the distance from the incenter to vertex A, which is different. I think there's a formula for the distance from the incenter to a vertex. Let me recall.

Yes, the formula is:

IA = √(r² + (s - a)²)

Where r is the inradius, s is the sem
