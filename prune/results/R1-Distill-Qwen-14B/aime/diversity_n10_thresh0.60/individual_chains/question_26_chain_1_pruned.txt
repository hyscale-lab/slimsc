Okay, so I have this geometry problem here. Let me try to understand it step by step. The problem is about a triangle ABC inscribed in a circle ω. The tangents at points B and C intersect at point D, and when we draw line AD, it intersects the circle ω again at point P. We're given the lengths of the sides: AB is 5, BC is 9, and AC is 10. We need to find the length of AP, express it as a fraction m/n where m and n are coprime, and then find m + n.

Hmm, okay. Let me try to visualize this. Triangle ABC with sides 5, 9, 10. So it's definitely a scalene triangle. The circle ω is the circumcircle of triangle ABC. The tangents at B and C meet at D. So, D is the ex-pole or something related to the tangents at B and C. Then AD intersects the circle again at P. So AP is a part of this secant line from A through D to the circle.

I remember that when you have tangents from a point to a circle, the lengths are equal. So, the tangent from D to ω at B is equal in length to the tangent from D to ω at C. That is, DB = DC. That might be useful.

Since ABC is inscribed in ω, ω is the circumcircle, so all vertices lie on the circle. Point D is outside ω, and DB and DC are tangent to ω. So, D is the exsimilicenter or something like that. Wait, actually, the point where two tangents meet is called the external homothety center or something similar. But maybe I don't need to get too deep into that.

So, perhaps I can use some properties of power of a point. The power of point D with respect to circle ω should be equal to DB² = DC². And the power of D can also be calculated as DA * DP, since AD is a secant line passing through P. So, Power of D: DB² = DA * DP.

So, if I can find DA and DP, or relate them in some way, that might help me find AP.

But wait, AP is the segment from A to P. So, AP = AD - DP, or is it AD + DP? No, wait. A is inside the circle, right? Because the triangle is inscribed in the circle, so all the points A, B, C are on the circle. So, line AD starts at A, goes through the circle at P, then goes to D outside. So, AP is from A to P, which is a chord of the circle. Then DP is the extension from P to D. So, yes, AP is part of AD, but AD is from A to D, passing through P.

So, the power of point D with respect to ω is DB² = DP * DA.

So, DB² = DP * DA.

But I need to find AP. If I can find DP, then since AD = AP + PD, but actually, AP is from A to P, and PD is from P to D. So, AD = AP +
