Okay, so I have this geometry problem here. Let me read it again to make sure I understand all the parts.

We have triangle ABC inscribed in a circle ω. The tangents to ω at points B and C intersect at point D. Then, line AD intersects ω again at point P. We're given the lengths of the sides: AB is 5, BC is 9, and AC is 10. We need to find the length of AP, express it as a fraction m/n where m and n are coprime, and then find m + n.

Hmm, okay. So, we have triangle ABC with sides 5, 9, 10. Let me visualize that. Let me sketch it mentally: point A, connected to B (5 units) and C (10 units apart), with BC being 9 units. So, triangle with sides 5,9,10.

The triangle is inscribed in a circle ω, so ω is the circumcircle of triangle ABC. Then, the tangents at B and C meet at D. So, D is the ex-pole or something? Wait, no, D is the intersection of the two tangents at B and C. So, in circle geometry, the point where two tangents meet is called the ex-pole or the external homothety center? I'm not sure, but I know that D lies outside the circle ω, and lines DB and DC are tangents to ω.

From point D, we draw line AD, which intersects ω again at point P. So, P is the second intersection point of AD with the circumcircle. We need to find AP.

I think this might involve some power of a point, properties of cyclic quadrilaterals, similar triangles, or perhaps some inversion. Hmm, not sure yet. Let me jot down what I know.

First, since D is the intersection of tangents at B and C, by the power of a point theorem, we know that DB² = DC² = DA * DP. That's because the power of point D with respect to ω is DB², and since AD intersects ω at A and P, the power is also DA * DP. So, DB² = DC² = DA * DP.

So, if I can find DA, then I can find DP, and hence AP would be DA + DP or something? Wait, no, because P is between A and D or beyond D? Wait, AD is a line from A through D, but wait, A is on the circle, and D is outside. So, when we draw AD, it starts at A, goes through D, and then intersects the circle again at P. Wait, no, that can't be because A is already on the circle. So, AD goes from A, through some point inside the circle, and then exits at another point P. Wait, no, that's not right either. Wait, A is on ω, and D is outside ω. So, line AD starts at A, goes towards D, but since D is outside, AD must intersect ω again at some point P on the way from A to D. So, AP is a chord of ω, and DP is the segment
