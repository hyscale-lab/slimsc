Okay, so I'm trying to solve this geometry problem about a tetrahedron. Let me see... The tetrahedron is labeled ABCD, and all the opposite edges are equal. Specifically, AB = CD = sqrt(41), AC = BD = sqrt(80), and BC = AD = sqrt(89). There's a point I inside the tetrahedron such that the distances from I to each of the four faces are all equal. I need to find this distance, which is given in a specific form, and then compute m + n + p where the distance is mâˆšn / p, with m and p coprime and n square-free.

Hmm, I remember that in a tetrahedron, the point equidistant from all four faces is called the incenter, similar to the incenter in a triangle. The distance from the incenter to each face is called the inradius. So, I need to find the inradius of this tetrahedron.

To find the inradius, I think I need to find the volume of the tetrahedron and the total surface area. The formula for the inradius is 3 times the volume divided by the total surface area. Let me write that down:

r = 3V / A_total

Where V is the volume and A_total is the sum of the areas of all four faces.

So, first step: find the volume of the tetrahedron. Second step: find the areas of each face. Third step: compute the total surface area. Fourth step: compute the inradius.

But wait, how do I find the volume of a tetrahedron when I know the lengths of all edges? I recall that for a tetrahedron with edge lengths a, b, c, a', b', c', it's a bit complicated, but maybe there's a formula or a method to compute it given all the edges.

Alternatively, since the opposite edges are equal, this might be a special kind of tetrahedron. Maybe a isohedral tetrahedron or something. Alternatively, perhaps it's a tetrahedron that can be embedded in a coordinate system in a symmetric way.

Wait, perhaps I can assign coordinates to the vertices in such a way that calculations will be easier. Let me try that.

Let me place the vertices in 3D space. Let me suppose that point A is at (
