Okay, so I have this math problem here: I need to find the number of paths of length 16 on an 8x8 grid. These paths start from the lower left corner and end at the upper right corner. The catch is that these paths must change direction exactly four times. Hmm, okay, let me break this down.

First, let me visualize the grid. It's an 8x8 grid, which means it has 9 horizontal lines and 9 vertical lines, right? So moving from the lower left to the upper right corner would require moving 8 steps to the right and 8 steps up. The total number of steps is 16, which is why the path length is 16.

Now, without any restrictions, the number of such paths is given by the binomial coefficient C(16,8), which is 12870. But this problem adds a constraint: the path must change direction exactly four times. So I need to figure out how to count only those paths that have exactly four direction changes.

Wait, direction changes... So each time the path switches from moving right to up or from up to right, that's a direction change. Let me think about how direction changes relate to the number of segments in the path.

Each path is composed of a series of horizontal and vertical segments. Each segment is a straight line either to the right or upwards. Every time the direction changes, a new segment starts. So, if a path changes direction exactly four times, how many segments does it have?

Well, the path starts in one direction, say right, then changes direction each time. So the number of segments is one more than the number of direction changes. For example, if there are four direction changes, the path has five segments. Wait, is that right? Let me check with a small example.

Suppose a path goes right, then up, then right, then up—so that's two direction changes. So the segments are right, up, right, up. That's four segments, which is two direction changes plus two. Hmm, so maybe the number of segments is direction changes plus one. So four direction changes would lead to five segments.

So, if we have four direction changes, the path consists of five segments. Each segment is either entirely right or entirely up. Now, these segments must be arranged such that the path starts at (0,0) and ends at (8,8). So the sum of the lengths of the right segments must be 8, and the sum of the lengths of the up segments must also be 8.

But each segment must be at least length 1, right? Because you can't have a segment of length zero—that would mean not moving at all, which doesn't make sense in the context of a path. So, each of these five segments has to be at least length 1.

Wait, but hold on. If we have five segments, and each segment is at least length 1, then the sum of the right segments is 8, so we can model this as distributing 8 units into 5 variables, each at least 1. The number of ways to do that is C(8-1,5-1) = C(7,4) = 35. Similarly for the up segments.

But wait, is that correct? Let me think. If we have k segments, each at least length 1
