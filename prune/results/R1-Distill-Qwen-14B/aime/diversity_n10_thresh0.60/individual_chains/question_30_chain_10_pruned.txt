Okay, so I've got this problem here that says: Let ω not equal to 1 be a 13th root of unity. I need to find the remainder when the product from k=0 to 12 of (2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k}) is divided by 1000. Hmm, that sounds a bit intimidating at first, but I think I can break it down.

First, I remember that roots of unity have some nice properties, especially when it comes to cyclotomic polynomials. Since ω is a primitive 13th root of unity (because ω ≠ 1), I might be able to use some properties related to that. The product given is a product over all 13th roots of unity, except maybe when k=0, but wait, k goes from 0 to 12, so it includes ω^0 = 1 as well. So each term in the product is 2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k} for each k from 0 to 12.

Wait, but when k=0, ω^0 is 1, so the term becomes 2 - 2*1 + 1^2 = 2 - 2 + 1 = 1. So the first term is 1, which is fine. So the product is 1 multiplied by the rest of the terms. So the product is actually the same as the product from k=1 to 12, because multiplying by 1 doesn't change anything.

So, the product is Π_{k=1}^{12} (2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k}).

I need to compute this product. Hmm, perhaps I can factor this expression somehow. Let's look at the term inside the product: 2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k}. Maybe I can factor this quadratic in ω^k.

Let me set x = ω^k. Then the term becomes 2 - 2x + x². Let's rearrange it: x² - 2x + 2. Hmm, can this be factored? Let me check the discriminant. The discriminant is ( -2 )² - 4*1*2 = 4 - 8 = -4, which is negative, so it doesn't factor over the reals, but maybe over the complex numbers? Or maybe I can relate it to another polynomial.

Wait, since ω is a 13th root of unity, x is also a 13th root of unity because x = ω^k, and since 13 is prime, unless k is a multiple of 13, which it's not because k ranges from 1 to 12, x is a primitive 13th root of unity. So x^13 = 1.

So, perhaps I can relate the product to a polynomial evaluated at the roots of unity. Remember that for a polynomial, the product over (z - root) is the polynomial. But here, each term is a quadratic in x: x² - 2x + 2. So I'm taking the product
