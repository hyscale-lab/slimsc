Okay, so I'm trying to solve this math problem where I need to find the number of intersections between two graphs. The functions involved are a bit complicated, but I'll try to break them down step by step.

The problem defines two functions: f(x) = ||x| - 1/2| and g(x) = ||x| - 1/4|. Then, the two graphs given are y = 4g(f(sin(2πx))) and x = 4g(f(cos(3πy))). I need to find how many times these two graphs intersect.

First, I think I should understand what the functions f(x) and g(x) look like. Since they involve absolute values, they're probably piecewise linear functions with possible V-shapes.

Starting with f(x) = ||x| - 1/2|. Let's consider the innermost part first: |x|. That's a V-shape graph with the vertex at (0,0). Then, subtracting 1/2 inside the absolute value: |x| - 1/2. This shifts the graph down by 1/2. But since it's inside another absolute value, the negative parts will be flipped. So, f(x) will have a V-shape with its vertex at points where |x| - 1/2 = 0, which is at x = ±1/2. So, f(x) will have two V-shapes: one centered at x=1/2 and another at x=-1/2. The graph will look like two Vs touching at x=0. Specifically, f(x) should have its minimum value at x=0, where f(0)=|0 - 1/2|=1/2. Then, as x moves away from 0, it decreases to 0 at x=±1/2, and then increases again beyond that.

Similarly, g(x) = ||x| - 1/4|. Let's analyze this. Again, starting with |x|, then subtracting 1/4, and then taking the absolute value. The inner |x| - 1/4 will shift the V down by 1/4. Then, taking the absolute value will flip any negative parts. The points where |x| - 1/4 =0 are at x=±1/4. So, g(x) should have two Vs at x=±1/4, with the vertex at x=0. The value at x=0 is |0 - 1/4|=1/4. Then, it decreases to 0 at x=±1/4 and increases beyond that.

So, both f and g are V-shaped functions with their own symmetries and vertices.

Now, the functions in the problem are 4g(f(sin(2πx))) for y and 4g(f(cos(3πy))) for x. So, I need to analyze these composite functions.

Let me start by understanding f(sin(2πx)).

Since sin(2πx) oscillates between -1 and 1, and f(x) is defined for all real numbers, but sin(2πx) is periodic with period 1. So, f(sin(2πx)) will be a function that oscillates with period 1. Let me think about how f behaves when its input is between -1 and 1.

Wait, f(x) = ||x| - 1/2|. When x is in [-1,1], what does this function look like?

At x=0: f(0) = |0 - 1/2| = 1/2

At x=1/2: f(1/2) = |1/2 - 1/2| = 0

At x=1: f(1) = |1 - 1/2| = 1/2

Similarly, for x between 0 and 1/2, f(x) decreases from 1/2 to 0.

For x between 1/2 and 1, f(x) increases back to 1/2.

Similarly, for x between -1 and 0, the function behaves symmetrically, but since we're taking absolute values, it's symmetric about the y-axis.

So, if I plot f(sin(2πx)), since sin(2πx) ranges between -1 and 1, the output of f(sin(2πx)) will range between 0 and 1/2.

Wait, let me check:

Because sin(2πx) is between -1 and 1, so |sin(2πx)| is between 0 and 1. Then, | |sin(2πx)| - 1/2 |.

So, if |sin(2πx)| is >= 1/2, then | |sin(2πx)|
