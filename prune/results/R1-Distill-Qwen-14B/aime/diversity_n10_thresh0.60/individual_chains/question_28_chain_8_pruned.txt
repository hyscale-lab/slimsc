Okay, so I'm trying to solve this geometry problem about a tetrahedron. Let me see... The tetrahedron is labeled ABCD, and it has some specific edge lengths. The edges AB and CD are both √41, AC and BD are √80, and BC and AD are √89. The problem is asking about a point I inside the tetrahedron that's equidistant from all four faces. This distance is called the inradius, I think, similar to the inradius of a triangle. They want this distance expressed in the form m√n / p, where m, n, p are positive integers, m and p are coprime, and n is square-free. Then, I have to find m + n + p.

Alright, so first, I remember that in a tetrahedron, the inradius can be found using the formula:

r = 3V / S

where V is the volume of the tetrahedron, and S is the total surface area (sum of the areas of all four faces). So, I need to find both the volume and the surface area.

But wait, how do I find the volume of this tetrahedron? I don't have coordinates, so maybe I need to use some formula based on edge lengths? I think there's a formula called the Cayley-Menger determinant which can give the volume of a tetrahedron given all its edge lengths. Yeah, that sounds right. Let me recall what that is.

The Cayley-Menger determinant for a tetrahedron with edge lengths AB = a, AC = b, AD = c, BC = d, BD = e, CD = f is given by:

Volume = √[ determinant / 288 ]

where the determinant is:

| 0   1    1    1    1  |
| 1   0   a²   b²   c² |
| 1  a²   0    d²   e² |
| 1  b²  d²   0    f² |
| 1  c²  e²   f²   0  |

So, I need to plug in the given edge lengths into this determinant. Let's list the edges again:

AB = √41 → a² = 41

AC = √80 → b² = 80

AD = √89 → c² = 89

BC = √89 → d² = 89

BD = √80 → e² = 80

CD = √41 → f² = 41

So, the determinant matrix becomes:

Row 0: 0, 1, 1, 1, 1

Row 1: 1, 0, 41, 80, 89

Row 2: 1, 41, 0, 89, 80

Row 3: 1, 80, 89, 0, 41

Row 4: 1, 89, 80, 41, 0

I need to compute this determinant. Hmm, this might be a bit tedious, but let's proceed step by step. Maybe I can compute it using expansion by minors or row operations to simplify it.

Wait, the determinant is a 5x5 matrix. Calculating it manually might be error-prone. Let me see if there's a pattern or symmetry here. Looking at the matrix, it's symmetric along the main diagonal. Maybe this can help.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use the fact that the tetrahedron is "equifacial" or something? Wait, no, equifacial would mean all faces are congruent, which I don't think is the case here. Let me see: the opposite edges are equal. AB=CD, AC=BD, AD=BC. So, it's a kind of symmetric tetrahedron. I think it's called a "disphenoid," where opposite edges are equal. So, it's a tetrahedron where each pair of opposite edges are equal. That might have some useful properties.

In a disphenoid, the volume can be found by a simpler formula, perhaps? Let me recall: For a disphenoid, the volume is sqrt[(a² + b² - c²)(a² + b² + c²)] / 12, but wait, I'm not sure. Maybe I should stick with the Cayley-Menger determinant.

Alright, let's compute the determinant.

The determinant of a 5x5 matrix is a bit complex, but perhaps I can use the formula for the Cayley-Menger determinant. I think it's given by:

det = -4 * Volume² * 288

Wait, no, the formula for the volume is sqrt(det / 288). So, the determinant is 288 * Volume². So, once I compute the determinant, I can find the volume.

But computing a 5x5 determinant is going to take a while. Maybe I can use some properties or simplify the matrix.

Alternatively, maybe I can find vectors for the edges and compute the volume using the scalar triple product. But without coordinates, that might be tricky. Alternatively, perhaps I can assign coordinates to the points to make the calculations easier.

Wait, that's a good idea. Let me assign coordinates to the tetrahedron. Let me choose point A at (0,0,0). Then, perhaps I can place point B along the x-axis, point C in the xy-plane, and point D somewhere in 3D space.

So, let me define:

A = (0, 0, 0)

B = (x, 0, 0)

C = (p, q, 0)

D = (r, s,
