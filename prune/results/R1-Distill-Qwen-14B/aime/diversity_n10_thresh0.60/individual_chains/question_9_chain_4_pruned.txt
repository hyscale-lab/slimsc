Okay, so I have this problem where there are real numbers x and y, both greater than 1, such that log base x of y^x equals 10 and log base y of x^{4y} also equals 10. I need to find the product xy.

Hmm, let me write down the given equations to get a better grasp.

First equation: log_x(y^x) = 10.

Second equation: log_y(x^{4y}) = 10.

I remember some logarithm properties. For the first equation, log_x(y^x) can be simplified. The exponent can come down as a multiplier. So that would be x * log_x(y) = 10.

Similarly, for the second equation, log_y(x^{4y}) can be rewritten as 4y * log_y(x) = 10.

So now I have two equations:

1. x * log_x(y) = 10
2. 4y * log_y(x) = 10

I also recall that log_a(b) is equal to 1 / log_b(a). So, log_x(y) is the same as 1 / log_y(x). Let me denote log_x(y) as A. Then log_y(x) would be 1/A.

So substituting back into the equations:

1. x * A = 10
2. 4y * (1/A) = 10

So now I have:

Equation 1: xA = 10

Equation 2: (4y)/A = 10

I can solve these two equations for x and y in terms of A. Let me try to express x and y from both equations.

From Equation 1: x = 10 / A

From Equation 2: 4y = 10A â†’ y = (10A) / 4 = (5A)/2.

So now I have x and y in terms of A. But I need another equation to find the value of A. Wait, maybe I can use the relationship between x and y.

Since x and y are positive real numbers greater than 1, and A is log_x(y), which is positive. Let me think if I can relate x and y through another equation.

Wait, earlier I used that log_x(y) = A. So, by definition, y = x^A.

Because log_x(y) = A implies that x^A = y.

So, substituting y = x^A into the expression for y that I found earlier: y = (5A)/2.

But since y is also equal to x^A, I can set x^A = (5A)/2.

But from Equation 1, I know that x = 10 / A. So substituting x into this, I get:

(10 / A)^A = (5A)/2.

Hmm, that's a bit complicated, but maybe we can take natural logarithms on both sides to simplify.

Taking ln on both sides:

A * ln(10 / A) = ln(5A / 2)

So, A * [ln(10) - ln(A)] = ln(5) + ln(A) - ln(2)

Wait, let me double-check that step. Wait, ln(5A/2) is ln(5) + ln(A) - ln(2), correct. Because ln(ab/c) = ln(a) + ln(b) - ln(c).

So, expanding the left side:

A*ln(10) - A*ln(A) = ln(5) + ln(A) - ln(2)

Let me collect like terms. Bring all terms to the left side:

A*ln(10) - A*ln(A) - ln(5) - ln(A) + ln(2) = 0

Hmm, this seems messy. Maybe we can factor out ln(A) terms.

Wait, let's see:

Left side: A ln(10) - (A ln A + ln A) - ln5 + ln2

So, grouping terms with ln A:

= A ln(10) - ln A (A + 1) - (ln5 - ln2) = 0

Hmm, not sure if that's helpful. Maybe another approach.

Alternatively, perhaps we can let t = A, so A is the variable.

So equation is:

t * (ln(10) - ln(t)) = ln(5) + ln(t) - ln(2)

We can write this as:

t ln(10) - t ln(t) = ln(5) + ln(t) - ln(2)

Bring all terms to left:

t ln(10) - t ln(t) - ln(5) - ln(t) + ln(2) = 0

Factor where possible.

Let me factor ln(t):

= t ln(10) - ln(t) (t + 1) - ln(5) + ln(2) = 0

Hmm, not sure. Maybe let's plug in some numbers to see if we can find a value of t that satisfies this equation.

Alternatively, perhaps there's symmetry or substitution to make this easier.

Wait, let me remember that in the original equations, we have x and y. Maybe we can find a relationship between x and y.

We have y = x^A, and x = 10/A.

So, let's consider the product xy.

xy = x * y = (10/A) * (5A/2) = (10 / A) * (5A/2) = (10 * 5A) / (2A) )= (5
