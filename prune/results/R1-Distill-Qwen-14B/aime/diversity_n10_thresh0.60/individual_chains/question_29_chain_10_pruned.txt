Okay, let me try to figure out how to solve this problem. So, we have two rectangles, ABCD and EFGH. Points D, E, C, F are collinear, which means they lie on a straight line. Also, points A, D, H, G all lie on a circle. The given lengths are BC=16, AB=107, FG=17, and EF=184. We need to find the length of CE.

First, let me visualize the problem. I think drawing a diagram might help, but since I can't draw, I'll try to imagine it. So, rectangle ABCD has sides AB=107 and BC=16. That means AB is the longer side, so ABCD is a tall and narrow rectangle. Similarly, rectangle EFGH has sides FG=17 and EF=184, so EF is the longer side here, making EFGH a wide and short rectangle.

Since D, E, C, F are collinear, they all lie on a straight line. Let's assume that this line is horizontal for simplicity. So, point D is one of the vertices of rectangle ABCD. Since ABCD is a rectangle, its vertices are arranged such that AB is one side, BC is another, CD is the opposite of AB, and DA is the opposite of BC. So, if we consider rectangle ABCD, points A, B, C, D go in order, making a rectangle.

Similarly, rectangle EFGH has vertices E, F, G, H. Since EFGH is a rectangle, EF and FG are adjacent sides. So, point E is connected to F and H, F is connected to E and G, G is connected to F and H, and H is connected to G and E.

Now, points D, E, C, F are collinear. So, if I imagine both rectangles, perhaps they are placed such that their sides DC and EF lie on the same line. Wait, that can't be because DC is part of rectangle ABCD, and EF is part of EFGH. If D and C are the endpoints of DC, and E and F are endpoints of EF, and they lie on the same line, maybe the rectangles are placed adjacent to each other along this line.

But then, also, points A, D, H, G lie on a circle. That's interesting. So, these four points lie on the circumference of a circle, which means they are concyclic or lie on a common circle. Hmm, this is a key piece of information.

Let me try to assign coordinates to these points to make it easier. Maybe placing point D at the origin? Let's say point D is at (0,0). Since ABCD is a rectangle, and AB=107, BC=16, so if D is at (0,0), then C would be at (16, 0), right? Because BC is 16 and since in a rectangle, BC is adjacent to B, which is adjacent to A.

Wait, maybe I'm getting the sides mixed up. Wait, ABCD is a rectangle, so if AB is 107, BC is 16, then AD must be 16 as well. Hmm, no, wait, AD is another side, but perhaps I need to get the order right. Let me think.

In rectangle ABCD, the sides AB, BC, CD, DA are in order. So, AB is one side, BC is the next, CD is the opposite of AB, and DA is the opposite of BC. So, AB is 107, so BC is 16. So, if I place point A at (0,0), then B would be at (107, 0), C would be at (107, 16), and D would be at (0, 16). Wait, but the problem says that D, E, C, F are collinear. So, if D is at (0,16), and C is at (107, 16), then the line they are on is y=16, which is horizontal.

But then E and F would also have to be on this
