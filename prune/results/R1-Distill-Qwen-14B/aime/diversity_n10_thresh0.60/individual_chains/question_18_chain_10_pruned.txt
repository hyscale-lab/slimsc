Okay, so I have this problem about finding the number of rectangles that can be formed inside a regular dodecagon. Each side of the rectangle has to lie on either a side or a diagonal of the dodecagon. Hmm, interesting. I remember from geometry that a regular dodecagon has 12 sides, all equal in length, and all internal angles are equal too. 

First, I need to visualize the dodecagon. It's a 12-sided polygon, so each central angle is 360/12 = 30 degrees. That might come in handy later. Now, the problem is about rectangles, so I guess the sides of the rectangles are either sides of the dodecagon or its diagonals. 

I think each rectangle is determined by choosing two pairs of parallel sides. In a regular polygon, sides and diagonals can be parallel if the number of sides between them is the same. So, for the dodecagon, if I pick a side, there are other sides that are parallel to it, separated by two sides, four sides, etc. Wait, how does that work exactly?

Let me think. In a regular polygon, two sides are parallel if the number of sides between them is a multiple of half the total number of sides? Wait, for a dodecagon, which has 12 sides, which is even, so the number of sides between two parallel sides would be 6. So, each side is parallel to the one opposite it. But wait, 12 is even, so 12/2 = 6. So, each side has an opposite side that's parallel, right? So, for each side, the side six steps away is parallel.

Similarly, for diagonals, I think diagonals can also be parallel if the number of sides between them is a multiple of some number. So, perhaps, to form a rectangle, I need two pairs of these parallel lines, each pair being either sides or diagonals, and intersecting each other to form the rectangle.

So, perhaps the way to approach this is to figure out all possible pairs of parallel lines (both sides and diagonals) and then see how they can form rectangles.

Wait, but maybe another approach is to think about the dodecagon as a regular 12-gon inscribed in a circle. Then, all the vertices are equally spaced on the circumference. So, each vertex can be considered as a point on the circle at angles of 30 degrees apart.

In such a setup, sides and diagonals correspond to chords of the circle. So, sides correspond to chords that skip 1 vertex (length between two adjacent vertices), diagonals can skip 2, 3, up to 5 vertices because skipping 6 would bring you back to the opposite side, which is a diameter.

Wait, so the diagonals can be categorized by how many vertices they skip. So, in a dodecagon, the possible step sizes between connected vertices are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6. But for diagonals, we consider steps greater than 1 and less than 6 (since step 6 would be a diameter). So, diagonals can be of different lengths based on how many vertices they skip.

Now, for a rectangle to be formed, we need two
