Okay, let me try to work through this problem step by step. So, the problem is about Aya going for a 9-kilometer walk every morning and stopping at a coffee shop. The key here is to figure out how long her walk takes when she walks at a speed of s + 1/2 km/h, including the time she spends in the coffee shop.

First, let me parse the information given:

1. When Aya walks at a constant speed of s km/h, her walk takes 4 hours. But this time includes t minutes spent in the coffee shop. So, the total time from when she starts until she leaves the coffee shop is 4 hours, which includes both walking and the coffee break.

2. When she increases her walking speed to s + 2 km/h, the walk takes her 2 hours and 24 minutes. Again, this total time includes the t minutes in the coffee shop.

We need to find how long her walk will take when she walks at s + 1/2 km/h, including t minutes.

Hmm, okay. So, it's a rate, time, distance problem. Remember, the formula is distance = speed Ã— time. But here, the total time includes both walking and the coffee shop time, so we have to separate those two components.

Let me denote:

- Let t be the time spent in the coffee shop in hours. Wait, but the problem gives t in minutes. Hmm, perhaps I should convert everything into hours to keep the units consistent.

Wait, in the first scenario, the total time is 4 hours, which includes t minutes. So t is in minutes, but I need to convert t to hours when doing calculations. Similarly for the second scenario.

Wait, maybe it's better to convert all times to hours to avoid confusion. Let me write down:

Given:
- First scenario: speed = s km/h, total time = 4 hours (which includes t minutes of coffee shop). So, the actual walking time is 4 hours minus (t/60) hours.

- Second scenario: speed = s + 2 km/h, total time = 2 hours and 24 minutes. Let me convert that to hours: 24 minutes is 24/60 = 0.4 hours, so total time is 2.4 hours. So, walking time is 2.4 hours minus (t/60) hours.

But wait, the distance walked is the
