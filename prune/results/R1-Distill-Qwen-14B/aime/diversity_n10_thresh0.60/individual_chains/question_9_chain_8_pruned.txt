Okay, so I have this logarithm problem here, and I need to find the product xy where both x and y are greater than 1. The problem states that log base x of y^x is equal to 10, and log base y of x^{4y} is also equal to 10. Hmm, okay, let me try to parse this step by step.

First, I remember that logarithms can be tricky, but maybe I can convert these logarithmic equations into exponential form to make them easier to handle. Let me start with the first equation: log_x(y^x) = 10. 

I know that log_b(a) = c is equivalent to b^c = a. So, applying that here, log_x(y^x) = 10 should mean that x^10 = y^x. That seems right because the base x raised to the power of 10 equals y^x. So, equation one is x^10 = y^x.

Now, moving on to the second equation: log_y(x^{4y}) = 10. Using the same logic, this should translate to y^10 = x^{4y}. So, equation two is y^10 = x^{4y}.

Okay, so now I have two equations:

1. x^10 = y^x
2. y^10 = x^{4y}

Hmm, I need to solve for x and y. Both equations involve exponents with variables in the power, which might be a bit complicated, but maybe I can find a way to relate them.

Let me take equation one: x^10 = y^x. Maybe I can express y in terms of x or vice versa. Let's see. Taking both sides to the power of 1/x, I get (x^10)^(1/x) = y. Which simplifies to x^(10/x) = y. So, y = x^(10/x). That seems useful. Maybe I can substitute this into the second equation.

So, equation two is y^10 = x^{4y}. Substituting y from equation one, we get (x^(10/x))^10 = x^{4y}. Let me simplify the left side first.

(x^(10/x))^10 is equal to x^(10/x * 10) which is x^(100/x). So, left side is x^(100/x). The right side is x^{4y}. Since the bases are the same, I can set the exponents equal to each other: 100/x = 4y.

So, 100/x = 4y. Let me write that down: 100/x = 4y. Hmm, maybe I can solve for y here in terms of x. Dividing both sides by 4, I get y = (100/x)/4 = 25/x. So, y = 25/x.

Wait, but from equation one, I had y = x^(10/x). So now I have two expressions for y: one is x^(10/x), and the other is 25/x. So, I can set them equal to each other: x^(10/x) = 25/x.

Hmm, okay, so now I have an equation with x: x^(10/x) = 25/x. Hmm, how do I solve this? It looks a bit complicated because x is in both the base and the exponent. Maybe I can take logarithms on both sides to simplify.

Taking natural logarithm on both sides: ln(x^(10/x)) = ln(25/x). Using the logarithm power rule, that would be (10/x) * ln(x) = ln(25) - ln(x).

Let me write that out: (10/x)*ln(x) = ln(25) - ln(x).

Hmm, maybe I can bring all the ln(x) terms to one side. Let's add ln(x) to both sides:

(10/x)*ln(x) + ln(x) = ln(25).

Factor out ln(x): ln(x) * (10/x + 1) = ln(25).

Hmm, that seems a bit better. Let me write it as ln(x) * ( (10 + x)/x ) = ln(25).

So, ln(x) * (x + 10)/x = ln(25).

Hmm, maybe I can multiply both sides by x/(x + 10) to isolate ln(x):

ln(x) = [x/(x + 10)] * ln(25).

Alternatively, I can write this as:

ln(x) = ln(25) * [x/(x + 10)]
