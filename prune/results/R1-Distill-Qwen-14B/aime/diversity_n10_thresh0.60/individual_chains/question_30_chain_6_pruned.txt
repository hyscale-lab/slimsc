Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the remainder when the product from k=0 to 12 of (2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k}) is divided by 1000. Here, ω is a 13th root of unity, and it's not equal to 1. Hmm, okay, roots of unity often come up in cyclotomic polynomials, so maybe that's relevant here.

Let me write down what I know. The 13th roots of unity are the solutions to the equation x^13 = 1. They can be expressed as ω^k for k = 0, 1, 2, ..., 12, where ω = e^(2πi/13). Since ω ≠ 1, we're looking at all the primitive roots except 1.

The product given is from k=0 to 12 of (2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k}). I wonder if I can factor this expression somehow or relate it to a known polynomial.

First, let's consider each term in the product: 2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k}. Maybe I can rewrite this in terms of ω^{k} to make it look more familiar. Let me set z = ω^k. Then each term becomes 2 - 2z + z².

So, the expression becomes 2 - 2z + z². Hmm, that's a quadratic in z. Let me rearrange it: z² - 2z + 2. I can write this as z² - 2z + 2. Maybe factor this? Let me see if it factors over the complex numbers.

Wait, discriminant is (2)^2 - 4*1*2 = 4 - 8 = -4. So, the roots are z = [2 ± sqrt(-4)] / 2 = [2 ± 2i]/2 = 1 ± i. So, the quadratic factors as (z - (1 + i))(z - (1 - i)). So, 2 - 2z + z² = (z - (1 + i))(z - (1 - i)).

So, each term in the product is (z - (1 + i))(z - (1 - i)), where z = ω^k. Therefore, the entire product becomes the product over k=0 to 12 of (ω^k - (1 + i))(ω^k - (1 - i)).

So, the product is equal to [product_{k=0}^{12} (ω^k - (1 + i))] * [product_{k=0}^{12} (ω^k - (1 - i))].

Now, I remember that the product over all roots of unity of (x - ω^k) is equal to x^{13} - 1, since ω is a primitive 13th root. But in our case, we're plugging in x = (1 + i). So, product_{k=0}^{12} (ω^k - (1 + i)) is equal to (1 + i)^{13} - 1, right?

Wait, no. Wait, the product over k=0 to 12 of (x - ω^k) is x^{13} - 1 because each ω^k is a root of x^{13} - 1. But if we set x = (1 + i), the product becomes (1 + i)^{13} - 1. Similarly, for (1 - i), it's (1 - i)^{13} - 1.

Wait, but actually, the product over k=0 to 12 of (x - ω^k) is equal to x^{13} - 1. So, if I plug in x = (1 + i), the product_{k=0}^{
