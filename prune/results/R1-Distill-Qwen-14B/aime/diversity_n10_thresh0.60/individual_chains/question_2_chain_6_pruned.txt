Okay, so I have this problem here with points O, A, and B. O is at (0,0), which is the origin. A is at (1/2, 0), so that's halfway along the x-axis between O and (1,0). B is at (0, sqrt(3)/2), which is somewhere along the y-axis, a bit less than (0,1) since sqrt(3)/2 is approximately 0.866.

The problem is talking about a family F of segments PQ of unit length in the first quadrant. So PQ is a line segment of length 1, with P on the x-axis and Q on the y-axis. So each segment PQ starts on the x-axis, goes to the y-axis, and the distance between P and Q is 1. So that forms a right triangle with legs along the axes and hypotenuse PQ of length 1.

I need to find a point C on segment AB, which is distinct from A and B, such that C doesn't lie on any other segment from this family F except for AB itself. So AB is one of these segments, right? Because A is on the x-axis at (1/2, 0) and B is on the y-axis at (0, sqrt(3)/2). Let me check the distance between A and B.

Distance AB would be sqrt[(1/2 - 0)^2 + (0 - sqrt(3)/2)^2] = sqrt[(1/4) + (3/4)] = sqrt[1] = 1. Oh, so AB is indeed a segment of length 1, so it's part of this family F. So the family F includes all such possible segments PQ with P on x-axis, Q on y-axis, and PQ of length 1.

Now, I need to find a point C on AB, not A or B, such that C isn't on any other segment from F. So C is unique in that sense. Then, I need to find OC squared, which is the square of the distance from the origin to point C.

So, first, let me think about how these segments PQ look. Since PQ is 1 unit long, and P is on the x-axis at (p,0), Q is on the y-axis at (0,q). Then, the distance between P and Q is sqrt(p^2 + q^2) = 1. So p^2 + q^2 = 1. So for each such segment PQ, p and q are positive real numbers such that p^2 + q^2 = 1.

So the family F is all these line segments between points (p,0) and (0,q) where p^2 + q^2 = 1, with p, q > 0.

Each such segment can be parametrized. Let me think about parametrizing a general segment PQ. Let's say a point on PQ can be written as (p - tp, tq) where t ranges from 0 to 1. Wait, no, that's not quite right. Let me think.

Alternatively, the line segment PQ goes from (p,0) to (0,q). So any point on PQ can be written as (p(1 - t), qt) where t is between 0 and 1. So when t=0, it's at (p,0), and t=1, it's at (0,q). That makes sense. So the parametric equation is (p(1 - t), q t).

So, for each t in [0,1], this gives a point on the segment PQ. So now, for each such segment, all points on it are (p(1 - t), q t) with t âˆˆ [0,1], and p^2 + q^2 = 1.

Now, point C is on AB, so let me find the equation of AB. Points A and B are (1/2,0) and (0, sqrt(3)/2). So the line AB can be parametrized as well. Let me find its equation.

The slope of AB is (sqrt(3)/2 - 0)/(0 - 1/2) = (sqrt(3)/2)/(-1/2) = -sqrt(3). So the equation is y = -sqrt(3) x + sqrt(3)*(1/2), since when x=1/2, y=0.

Wait, plugging x = 1/2 into y = -sqrt(3) x + c, we get 0 = -sqrt(3)*(1/2) + c, so c = sqrt(3)/2. So equation is y = -sqrt(3) x + sqrt(3)/2.

So any point on AB can be written as (x, -sqrt(3) x + sqrt(3)/2). Alternatively, parametrize it with a parameter s, where s goes from 0 to 1. Let me do that.

Let me let s be the parameter such that when s=0, it's at A (1/2, 0), and s=1, it's at B (0, sqrt(3)/2). So the parametric equations would be:

x = 1/2 * (1 - s)

y = (sqrt(3)/2) * s

That works because when s=0, x=1/2, y=0; s=1, x=0, y=sqrt(3)/2.

So, point C is on AB,
