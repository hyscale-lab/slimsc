Okay, so I have this geometry problem here, and I need to find the length of AP in the given triangle ABC. Let me try to visualize and jot down the given information first.

We have triangle ABC with sides AB=5, BC=9, and AC=10. It's inscribed in a circle ω. The tangents to ω at points B and C intersect at point D. Then, the line AD intersects the circle ω again at point P. We need to find the length AP, express it as a reduced fraction m/n, and then find m + n.

Hmm, let's think about what I know. First, tangents from a common external point to a circle are equal in length. So, since D is the intersection of the tangents at B and C, we can say that DB = DC. That might come in handy later.

Since ABC is a triangle inscribed in a circle, it's a cyclic quadrilateral, but wait, ABC is just a triangle. So, ω is the circumcircle of triangle ABC. The point D is outside the circle, and BD and CD are tangent to ω.

I remember that for a point outside a circle, the tangent segments are equal, so DB = DC. Also, the line from D to the center of the circle will bisect the angle BDC. But I'm not sure if that's useful right now.

Maybe I should start by finding some key properties of triangle ABC. Let me compute the semi-perimeter, area, and maybe some angles if needed.

Given sides AB=5, BC=9, AC=10. Let's compute the semi-perimeter (s):

s = (5 + 9 + 10)/2 = (24)/2 = 12

Now, using Heron's formula, the area (Δ) is sqrt[s(s - AB)(s - BC)(s - AC)].

So, Δ = sqrt[12(12 - 5)(12 - 9)(12 - 10)] = sqrt[12 * 7 * 3 * 2] = sqrt[504]

Simplify sqrt(504): 504 = 16 * 31.5? Wait, 504 divided by 16 is 31.5, which isn't an integer. Hmm, let's factor it differently.

504 = 16 * 31.5 → Hmm, maybe it's better to factor into primes.

504 = 2^3 * 3^2 * 7. So, sqrt(504) = sqrt(2^3 * 3^2 *7) = 2^(1.5) * 3 * sqrt(7) = 2*sqrt(2)*3*sqrt(7) = 6*sqrt(14). Wait, let me check that.

Wait, 2^3 is 8, 3^2 is 9. So, sqrt(2^3 * 3^2 *7) = 2^(1.5) * 3 * sqrt(7) = 2*sqrt(2)*3*sqrt(7) = 6*sqrt(14). Yes, because sqrt(2)*sqrt(7) = sqrt(14). So, area is 6*sqrt(14).

Alternatively, maybe I can find the circumradius R of triangle ABC. I remember the formula:

Δ = (a*b*c)/(4R)

Where a, b, c are the sides, and Δ is the area. So, solving for R:

R = (a*b*c)/(4Δ)

Given a=5, b=9, c=10, and Δ=6*sqrt(14), let's compute R.

First, compute the numerator: 5*9*10 = 450

Denominator: 4*6*sqrt(14) = 24*sqrt(14)

So, R = 450/(2
