Okay, so I've got this problem about rectangular boxes with a fixed surface area and volume. The goal is to find the radius of the smallest sphere that can contain any of these boxes, and then express r squared as a fraction p/q where p and q are coprime. Finally, I need to find p+q. Hmm, let's break this down.

First, the boxes have surface area 54 and volume 23. Let's denote the length, width, and height of the box as a, b, c respectively. So, the surface area S is given by 2(ab + bc + ac) = 54. And the volume V is abc = 23.

We need to find the smallest sphere that can contain such a box. The sphere will have a radius equal to half the space diagonal of the box because the sphere must enclose the entire box, and the space diagonal is the longest distance inside the box. So, the space diagonal d is sqrt(a² + b² + c²), which means the radius r is d/2. Therefore, r² is (a² + b² + c²)/4.

So, our task reduces to minimizing a² + b² + c² given the constraints 2(ab + bc + ac) = 54 and abc = 23. Interesting. So, we have two equations:

1) ab + bc + ac = 27

2) abc = 23

We need to find the minimum of a² + b² + c².

I recall that for three variables, there are inequalities that relate sums, products, and sums of squares. Maybe I can use Lagrange multipliers or some optimization method. Alternatively, maybe express two variables in terms of the third and then minimize.

Wait, another thought: For a given surface area and volume, the shape that minimizes the space diagonal (or a² + b² + c²) would be a cube, but in this case, the volume isn't a cube number relative to the surface area. So, the minimal sphere might not correspond to a cube. So, perhaps the minimal a² + b² + c² occurs when a = b = c, but let's check if that's possible.

If a = b = c, then the surface area would be 6a² = 54 → a² = 9 → a = 3. Then the volume would be 3³ = 27, but in our problem, the volume is 23, which is less than 27. So, a cube isn't possible here. So, the minimal a² + b² + c² occurs when the box is not a cube but perhaps when two sides are equal or something else.

So, we need to handle the optimization with constraints. Let's try using Lagrange multipliers.

Let’s set up the problem: Minimize f(a, b, c) = a² + b² + c², subject to the constraints g(a, b, c) = ab + bc + ac = 27 and h(a, b, c) = abc = 23.

Wait, actually, in the problem statement, the surface area is 54, which is 2(ab + bc + ac) → ab + bc + ac = 27. So, yes, that constraint is correct.

So, we can set up the Lagrangian as L = a² + b² + c² - λ(ab + bc + ac - 27) - μ(abc - 23)

Then, we take partial derivatives with respect to a, b, c, λ, μ and set them to zero.

Partial derivative with respect to a:

dL/da = 2a - λ(b + c) - μ bc = 0

Similarly,

dL/db = 2b - λ(a + c) - μ ac = 0

dL/dc = 2c - λ(a + b) - μ ab = 0

And the constraints:

ab + bc + ac = 27

abc = 23

So, now, I have a system of equations. Let me think about how to approach this.

Since the equations are symmetric, maybe we can assume that two variables are equal. Let's say a = b. Then, perhaps the problem becomes easier.

Let’s assume a = b. Then, let's see what happens.

So, a = b, then the constraints become:

ab + bc + ac = a² + 2ac = 27

Volume: a² c = 23

So, from the volume equation, c = 23/(a²). Plugging into the surface area equation:

a² + 2a*(23/(a²)) = 27

Simplify:

a² + (46/a) = 27

Multiply both sides by a:

a³ + 46 = 27a

Bring all terms to one side:

a³ -27a +46 =0

Hmm, solving this cubic equation. Let me see if it has any rational roots. By rational root theorem, possible roots are factors of 46 over factors of 1: ±1, ±2, ±23, ±46.

Testing a=1: 1 -27 +46=20 ≠0

a=2:8 -54 +46=0 → 8-54 is -46, +46 is 0. So, a=2 is a root.

So, we can factor the cubic as (a - 2)(a² + 2a -23) =0.

So, roots are a=2, and then solving a² +2a -23=0. Using quadratic formula: a = [-2 ± sqrt(4 +92)]/2 = [-2 ± sqrt(96)]/2 = [-2 ± 4*sqrt(6)]/2 = -1 ± 2*sqrt(6). Since a must be positive, a= -1 + 2*sqrt(6) ≈ -1+4.898≈3.898.

So, possible a=2 and a= -1 +2√6. Let's check these.

First, a=2. If a=2, then from volume, c=23/(2²)=23/4=5.75.

So, the box would have dimensions (2,2,5.75). Let's compute a² + b² + c² = 4 +4 + (5.75)^2= 8 + 33.0625=41.0625. So, r² would be 41.0625/4≈10.2656.

Alternatively, a= -1 +2√6≈3.898. Then c=23/(a²). Let's compute a²: ( -1 +2√6 )² =1 -4√6 + 24=25 -4√6. So, c=23/(25 -4√6). Let's rationalize the denominator:

Multiply numerator and denominator by (25 +4√6):

c=23*(25 +4√6)/( (25)^2 - (4√6)^2 )=
