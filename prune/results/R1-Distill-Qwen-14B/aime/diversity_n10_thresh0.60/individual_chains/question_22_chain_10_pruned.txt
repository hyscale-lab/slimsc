Okay, so I've got this problem about a convex equilateral hexagon, ABCDEF. All pairs of opposite sides are parallel. Then, there's a triangle formed by extending the sides AB, CD, and EF, and the sides of this triangle are 200, 240, and 300. I need to find the side length of the hexagon.

Hmm, let me think. First, I remember that in a convex equilateral hexagon with opposite sides parallel, it's sometimes called a "parallelogon" or something similar, but I'm not exactly sure of the properties. Maybe it's related to a regular hexagon? No, wait, regular hexagons have all sides equal and all angles equal, but this one is just equilateral and with opposite sides parallel. So it's not necessarily regular.

Since all sides are equal, each side AB = BC = CD = DE = EF = FA = s, where s is the side length we need to find. Also, opposite sides are parallel, so AB || DE, BC || EF, and CD || FA.

Now, the triangle formed by extending AB, CD, and EF has sides of lengths 200, 240, and 300. Let me try to visualize this. If I extend AB, CD, and EF, they should meet at some points forming a triangle. So, perhaps AB is extended beyond B to meet CD extended beyond D, and similarly for the other sides.

Wait, but in a convex hexagon, each internal angle is less than 180 degrees, so when we extend the sides, they will meet to form a triangle outside the hexagon.

Let me try to sketch a rough diagram in my mind. The hexagon is convex, so all vertices bulge out. Extending AB, CD, and EF, these are three non-consecutive sides. Wait, AB is a side, CD is two sides away, EF is three sides away. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the triangle is formed by the extensions of AB, CD, and EF themselves. So, if I imagine extending AB beyond A and B, CD beyond C and D, and EF beyond E and F, these lines should meet at three points, forming a larger triangle.

Given that, the triangle's sides are 200, 240, 300. So, maybe each side of this triangle is formed by the extension of one side of the hexagon.

I think I need to model this using coordinate geometry. Let me assign coordinates to the hexagon to make things clearer.

Let me try setting point A at (0,0). Since it's an equilateral hexagon, all sides are length s. Since opposite sides are parallel, the direction of each side is the same as the opposite side.

Let me denote the vectors for each side. Since the hexagon is convex, each turn is less than 180 degrees.

Wait, but maybe using vectors is complicating. Alternatively, since opposite sides are parallel, the sides can be thought of as three pairs of parallel sides.

So, sides AB and DE are parallel, BC and EF are parallel, and CD and FA are parallel.

Given that, the hexagon can be considered as being made by translating each side by some distance in their respective directions.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a centrally symmetric hex
