Okay, so I need to solve this geometry problem. Let me try to understand what's being asked here.

We have three points: O at (0,0), A at (1/2, 0), and B at (0, sqrt(3)/2). So, O is the origin, A is on the x-axis halfway to (1,0), and B is on the y-axis a bit above (0,1) since sqrt(3)/2 is approximately 0.866.

The family F consists of segments PQ of unit length. Each PQ has length 1, P is on the x-axis, Q is on the y-axis, and they lie in the first quadrant. So each segment connects a point on the x-axis to a point on the y-axis, with both coordinates positive, and the distance between P and Q is exactly 1.

Now, the problem says there's a unique point C on AB, not equal to A or B, that doesn't belong to any segment from F except for AB itself. So, AB is part of the family F, I suppose? Or is AB a separate thing? Hmm. Wait, O, A, B are given, and AB is a segment from A to B. So AB is a fixed segment. But F is the family of all such unit segments with P on x-axis and Q on y-axis.

So, each segment PQ in F is of length 1, with P(p,0) and Q(0,q) such that p^2 + q^2 = 1, since the distance between (p,0) and (0,q) is sqrt(p^2 + q^2) = 1. So p and q satisfy p^2 + q^2 =1, with p, q >0 because they are in the first quadrant.

Now, the point C is on AB, distinct from A and B, that doesn't lie on any other segment from F except for AB. So, AB is part of F? Let me check: the length of AB is the distance between A(1/2, 0) and B(0, sqrt(3)/2). Let me compute that distance: sqrt( (1/2)^2 + (sqrt(3)/2)^2 ) = sqrt(1/4 + 3/4) = sqrt(1) = 1. Ah, so AB is indeed a segment of length 1, so AB is in F.

Therefore, AB is one of the segments in F. Now, the point C is on AB, but it's not A or B, and it's not on any other segment from F except AB. So, we need to find such a point C on AB, compute OC^2, and that fraction will be p/q, then find p+q.

So, the key is to find C on AB such that no other segment in F passes through C. How do we approach this?

Maybe parametrize AB, find the equation of AB, then for a general point C on AB, find whether it's possible that C lies on another PQ in F, and set up conditions so that C doesn't lie on any other such PQ except AB.

So, first step: find the equation of AB.

Points A: (1/2, 0) and B: (0, sqrt(3)/2). So the slope of AB is (sqrt(3)/2 - 0)/(0 - 1/2) = (sqrt(3)/2) / (-1/2) = -sqrt(3). So the equation is y - 0 = -sqrt(3)(x - 1/2). So, y = -sqrt(3)x + (sqrt(3)/2). So any point C on AB can be written as (x, -sqrt(3)x + sqrt(3)/2), where x is between 0 and 1/2.

Wait, but when x=1/2, y= -sqrt(3)*(1/2) + sqrt(3)/2 = 0, which is point A. When x=0, y = sqrt(3)/2, which is point B. So, x ranges from 0 to 1/2.

Alternatively, we can parameterize AB with a parameter t, where t goes from 0 to 1. So, point C is given by C = A + t*(B - A). So, coordinates would be (1/2 - t*(1/2), 0 + t*(sqrt(3)/2)). So, x = (1 - t)/2, y = (t*sqrt(3))/2, where t ranges from 0 to 1.

But okay, perhaps it's easier to work with the equation y = -sqrt(3)x + sqrt(3)/2.

Now, the next step is to find for a general point (x, y) on AB, whether it lies on another PQ segment from F, i.e., another segment PQ with P(p, 0) and Q(0, q), such that p^2 + q^2 =1, and the point (x, y) lies on PQ.

So, the equation of PQ can be written as (x/p) + (y/q) =1. Because it connects (p,0) to (0,q), so intercept form of the line is x/p + y/q =1.

Given that (x, y) is on AB, so y = -sqrt(3)x + sqrt(3)/2. So, substituting into the equation of PQ, we have:

x
