Okay, so I'm trying to solve this problem where Alice chooses a set A of positive integers, and then Bob lists all finite nonempty sets B of positive integers such that the maximum element of B is in A. We know that Bob's list has 2024 sets, and we need to find the sum of the elements of A.

Hmm, let me break this down. First, what exactly is Bob doing? He's considering all finite nonempty sets B where the maximum of B is in A. So for each element m in A, Bob can create sets B where m is the maximum, and the other elements are any positive integers less than m.

Wait, but does that mean for each m in A, the number of possible sets B with max m is equal to the number of subsets of {1, 2, ..., m-1}, excluding the empty set? Because for each m, the other elements in B can be any subset of the numbers less than m, except the empty set since B has to be nonempty.

No, wait, actually, since B is a set, the elements must be distinct and non-empty. So for each m in A, the number of possible B sets where max is m is equal to the number of non-empty subsets of {1, 2, ..., m-1}. Because each such subset can be combined with m to form a set B where m is the maximum.

The number of non-empty subsets of a set with n elements is 2^n - 1. So for each m in A, the number of B sets with max m is 2^{m-1} - 1? Wait, no. Wait, the set {1, 2, ..., m-1} has m-1 elements. So the number of subsets is 2^{m-1}, including the empty set. So the number of non-empty subsets would be 2^{m-1} - 1. But wait, no. Because for each m, the set B can have any subset of {1, 2, ..., m-1} as its elements, but B is non-empty. So if the subset is non-empty, then B is just that subset plus m. Alternatively, if the subset is empty, then B is just {m}, which is allowed because B is non-empty.

Wait, so actually, the number of B sets with max m is equal to the number of subsets of {1, 2, ..., m-1}, including the empty set. Because for each subset S of {1, 2, ..., m-1}, the set B = S ∪ {m} is a set where the maximum is m. And since B is non-empty, S can be empty (which gives B = {m}), but if S is non-empty, that's fine too. So the total number of B sets with max m is equal to 2^{m-1}, because each element in {1, ..., m-1} can be either included or not in S.

But wait, actually, for each m, the number of B sets where max is m is 2^{m-1}, because there are m-1 elements below m, and each can be present or not. So each subset corresponds to a unique B set with maximum m. So for each m in A, we have 2^{m-1} possible B sets.

But wait, let me test this with a small example. Suppose m=1. Then the set B must have max 1, so B can only be {1}, since there are no smaller positive integers. So the number of B sets is 1. According to the formula, 2^{1-1}=1, which matches.

If m=2, the possible B sets are {1,2}, {2}, right? Because the maximum is 2, and the other elements can be subsets of {1}. The subsets of {1} are empty and {1}, so B can be {2} (empty subset plus 2) and {1,2} ({1} subset plus 2). So two sets, which is 2^{2-1}=2, correct.

For m=3, the subsets of {1,2} are empty, {1}, {2}, {1,2}. So B sets are {3}, {1,3}, {2,3}, {1,2,3}. So four sets, which is 2^{3-1}=4. Correct. So the formula holds.

Therefore, for each m in A, the number of B sets with max m is 2^{m-1}. Therefore, the total number of B sets is the sum over all m in A of 2^{m-1}.

Wait, but the problem says that Bob's list has 2024 sets. So, sum_{m ∈ A} 2^{m-1} = 2024.

We are to find the sum of elements in A, which is sum_{m ∈ A} m.

So, we have an equation: sum_{m ∈ A}
