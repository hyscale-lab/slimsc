Okay, so Alice and Bob are playing this game with a stack of n tokens. They take turns removing either 1 or 4 tokens each time. Alice goes first, and the person who takes the last token wins. I need to find how many positive integers n ≤ 2024 allow Bob to have a winning strategy, no matter how Alice plays.

Hmm, let's think about game theory here. This seems like a classic combinatorial game where each position can be either a winning or losing position for the player whose turn it is. A losing position is one where no matter what move you make, your opponent can force a win. So, if Bob can make the game reach a losing position for Alice on her turn, then Bob can win.

First, I should model this as a series of positions, where each position is the number of tokens left. For each position n, I'll determine if it's a winning (W) or losing (L) position.

Base cases:
- n=0: The game is over, so the player who just moved wins. So, the player who is about to move at n=0 will lose because there are no tokens to take. But in our game, the last token taken wins. So, if n=1, the player can take 1 token and win. Similarly, n=4, the player can take 4 and win. Wait, but n=0 is a losing position because you can't move.

Wait, perhaps I should define the positions based on whether the current player can force a win. Let me try to list the positions starting from n=0 upwards.

n=0: losing position (no moves possible)
n=1: current player can take 1 and win → W
n=2: take 1, leaving n=1 for opponent who can then take and win. Wait, but if you take 1, opponent is at n=1, which is W for them. So opponent can win. Alternatively, can you take 4? No, because n=2 <4. So the only move is to take 1, leading to opponent's win. So n=2 is L?
Wait, but that can't be right. Let me think again.

Wait, no. If n=2, the current player can take 1, leaving 1 for the opponent, who can then take and win. So the current player
