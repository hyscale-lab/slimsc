Okay, so I've got this problem about a torus and a sphere. The torus is made by revolving a circle with radius 3 around an axis that's 6 units away from the center of the circle. So, it's like a donut shape. The sphere has a radius of 11. 

The question is about when the torus rests inside the sphere and when it rests outside. When it's inside, they're tangent along a circle with radius r_i, and when it's outside, they're tangent along a circle with radius r_o. I need to find the difference r_i minus r_o, express it as a fraction m/n where m and n are coprime, and then find m + n.

Hmm, okay. Let me try to visualize this. So, the torus is like a donut, and the sphere is a larger sphere around it. When the torus is inside the sphere, they touch along a circle. Similarly, when it's outside, they touch along another circle. The radii of these circles are r_i and r_o, respectively.

First, I should probably figure out the properties of the torus. The problem says it's formed by revolving a circle of radius 3 around an axis that's 6 units away from the center. So, in terms of the standard torus equation, the major radius (the distance from the center of the generating circle to the axis) is R = 6, and the minor radius (the radius of the generating circle) is r = 3.

Wait, actually, I remember the formula for a torus is usually given in terms of the major radius R and minor radius r. So, in this case, R is 6 and r is 3.

Now, the sphere has a radius of 11. So, when the torus is inside the sphere, the distance between their centers must be such that they are tangent. Similarly, when the torus is outside, the distance between centers would be different.

Wait, but actually, both situations involve the torus being tangent to the sphere. So, whether the torus is inside or outside, the sphere is fixed with radius 11. So, when the torus is inside, the sphere is larger, and when outside, the torus is larger?

No, wait, no. The sphere is fixed with radius 11. So, when the torus is inside, it's placed inside the sphere, and when it's outside, it's placed outside. In both cases, the torus will be tangent to the sphere along a circle.

I think the key here is to find the points where the torus and the sphere touch. So, the tangent circles lie on both surfaces. For each case (inside and outside), I need to find the radius of this circle.

I remember that for two surfaces to be tangent along a circle, the distance between their centers must be such that the circle lies on both surfaces. So, perhaps I need to model both the torus and the sphere and find the condition where they are tangent.

Let me consider the torus first. The equation of a torus in 3D coordinates is given by (sqrt(x^2 + y^2) - R)^2 + z^
