Okay, so I've got this math problem here about Aya's morning walks. Let me read it again and try to break it down. 

Every morning, Aya goes for a 9-kilometer-long walk and stops at a coffee shop afterwards. When she walks at a constant speed of s kilometers per hour, the walk takes her 4 hours, including t minutes spent in the coffee shop. Then, when she walks at s+2 kilometers per hour, the walk takes her 2 hours and 24 minutes, including the same t minutes in the coffee shop. Now, the question is asking me to find the number of minutes the walk takes her when she walks at s + 1/2 kilometers per hour, including the t minutes in the coffee shop.

Hmm, okay. So, the key here seems to be figuring out what s and t are. Once I have those, I can calculate the time for the third scenario where her speed is s + 1/2 km/h.

Let me think. The walk is always 9 kilometers. So, the time she spends walking without the coffee stop would be different depending on her speed. But the problem includes the coffee shop time, which is t minutes, in both cases.

So, I guess I need to set up equations based on the two different scenarios given.

First scenario: speed is s km/h, total time is 4 hours, which includes t minutes of coffee shop time. So, the walking time alone would be 4 hours minus t minutes. Wait, but t is in minutes, and the walking time is in hours. I need to make sure the units are consistent.

Let me convert t minutes into hours. Since 1 hour = 60 minutes, t minutes is t/60 hours.

So, for the first scenario:
Walking time = total time - coffee shop time
Which is 4 hours - (t/60) hours.

But walking time is also equal to distance divided by speed. So, 9 km divided by s km/h gives the time in hours.

So, equation one is:
9/s = 4 - (t/60)

Similarly, for the second scenario, her speed is s + 2 km/h, and the total time is 2 hours and 24 minutes. Again, this includes t minutes in the coffee shop.

First, convert 2 hours 24 minutes into hours. 24 minutes is 24/60 hours, which is 0.4 hours. So, total time is 2.4 hours.

Therefore, the walking time is 2.4 hours minus t/60 hours.

Again, walking time is distance over speed, which is 9/(s + 2).

So, equation two is:
9/(s + 2) = 2.4 - (t/60)

Now, I have two equations with two variables: s and t. I can solve these equations simultaneously.

Let me write them again:

1) 9/s = 4 - (t/60)
2) 9/(s + 2) = 2.4 - (t/60)

Hmm, okay. So, let me denote equation 1 and equation 2.

I can rearrange both equations to solve for t/60. Maybe that would help me eliminate t.

From equation 1:
t/60 = 4 - (9/s)

From equation 2:
t/60 = 2.4 - (9/(s + 2))

Since both equal t/60, I can set them equal to each other:

4 - (9/s) = 2.4 - (9/(s + 2))

That gives me an equation with just s. Let me write that out:

4 - (9/s) = 2.4 - (9/(s + 2))

Let me subtract 2.4 from both sides to get:

4 - 2.4 - (9/s) + (9/(s + 2)) = 0

Which simplifies to:

1.6 - (9/s) + (9/(s + 2)) = 0

Alternatively, rearranged:

- (9/s) + (9/(s + 2)) = -1.6

Multiply both sides by -1:

(9/s) - (9/(s + 2)) = 1.6

Hmm, okay. Let me factor out the 9:

9 [ 1/s - 1/(s + 2) ] = 1.6

Compute the expression inside the brackets. 1/s - 1/(s + 2) is equal to [ (s + 2) - s ] / [s(s + 2)].

Which simplifies to 2 / [s(s + 2)].

So, substituting back:

9 * [ 2 / (s(s + 2)) ] = 1.6

Multiply 9 and
