Alright, let me try to figure out this problem step by step. So, the problem is about finding the greatest four-digit number N with a specific property. The property is that if you change any one of its digits to 1, the resulting number is divisible by 7. Then, we need to find Q + R where Q is the quotient and R is the remainder when N is divided by 1000.

Okay, first, let's understand the problem. We're dealing with a four-digit number, so N is between 1000 and 9999. The key property is that changing any single digit to 1 makes the number divisible by 7. That means if I take N, change the thousands digit to 1, the result is divisible by 7. Similarly, changing the hundreds, tens, or units digit to 1 should also result in a number divisible by 7.

So, N must be such that:

1. Changing the thousands digit to 1: 1abc (where a, b, c are the other digits) is divisible by 7.
2. Changing the hundreds digit to 1: a1bc is divisible by 7.
3. Changing the tens digit to 1: ab1c is divisible by 7.
4. Changing the units digit to 1: abc1 is divisible by 7.

Wait, but actually, N is a four-digit number, so when we change a digit, we're replacing that specific digit with 1. So, for example, if N is d1d2d3d4, changing the thousands digit gives 1d2d3d4, changing the hundreds gives d11d3d4, etc.

So, each of these four possibilities must be divisible by 7. That gives us four conditions that N must satisfy.

Our goal is to find the largest such N. Once we have N, we need to compute Q and R where N = 1000*Q + R. Then, Q + R is our target.

Let’s denote N as a four-digit number: N = 1000w + 100x + 10y + z, where w, x, y, z are its digits (w from 1-9, x, y, z from 0-9).

We need to find the maximum N such that:

1. When w is replaced by 1: 1000*1 + 100x + 10y + z is divisible by 7.
2. When x is replaced by 1: 1000w + 100*1 + 10y + z is divisible by 7.
3. When y is replaced by 1: 1000w + 100x + 10*1 + z is divisible by 7.
4. When z is replaced by 1: 1000w + 100x + 10y + 1 is divisible by 7.

So, let's write these four conditions mathematically.

First condition:
1000 + 100x + 10y + z ≡ 0 mod 7.

Second condition:
1000w + 100 + 10y + z ≡ 0 mod 7.

Third condition:
1000w + 100x + 10 + z ≡ 0 mod 7.

Fourth condition:
1000w + 100x + 10y + 1 ≡ 0 mod 7.

Hmm, okay. So each of these four expressions must be congruent to 0 modulo 7.

Let me note that 1000 mod 7, 100 mod 7, and 10 mod 7 can be precomputed to simplify calculations.

Calculating 1000 mod 7:

1000 / 7 = 142 *7 = 994, remainder 6. So 1000 ≡ 6 mod7.

Similarly, 100 mod7: 100 /7 is 14*7=98, remainder 2. So 100≡2 mod7.

10 mod7 is 3, since 10-7=3.

So, let's rewrite each condition using these.

First condition:

(1000 + 100x + 10y + z) mod7 = (6 + 2x + 3y + z) mod7 = 0.

Second condition:

(1000w + 100 + 10y + z) mod7 = (6w + 2 + 3y + z) mod7 = 0.

Third condition:

(1000w + 100x + 10 + z) mod7 = (6w + 2x + 3 + z) mod7 = 0.

Fourth condition:

(1000w + 100x + 10y + 1) mod7 = (6w + 2x + 3y + 1) mod7 = 0.

So now, we have four congruence equations:

1. 6 + 2x + 3y + z ≡ 0 mod7.  (C1)
2. 6w + 2 + 3y + z ≡ 0 mod7. (C2)
3. 6w + 2x + 3 + z ≡ 0 mod7. (C3)
4. 6w + 2x + 3y + 1 ≡ 0 mod7. (C4)

So, our variables are w, x, y, z. Each is a digit, with w from 1-9, others from 0-9.

We need to find the maximum N, which is 1000w + 100x +10y +z, so we should maximize w, then x, then y, then z.

Let me think about how to approach this. Maybe we can solve these equations step by step.

First, since we want the largest N, let's start with w=9 and see if we can find x, y, z that satisfy all four conditions. If not, decrement w and try again.

So, set w=9. Then, let's plug w=9 into the equations.

C2 becomes: 6*9 + 2 + 3y + z ≡0 mod7.

6*9=54. 54 mod7: 7*7=49, 54-49=5. So 54 ≡5 mod7.

So, C2: 5 + 2 + 3y + z ≡0 mod7 → 7 +3y + z ≡0 mod7 → 3y + z ≡0 mod7, because 7 mod7 is 0.

C3: 6*9 + 2x + 3 + z ≡0 mod7.

6*9=54≡5 mod7. So, 5 + 2x +3 + z ≡0 mod7 → (5+3) + 2x + z ≡0 →8 +2x + z ≡0 mod7. 8 mod7 is1, so 1 + 2x + z ≡0 → 2x + z ≡-1 ≡6 mod7.

C4:6*9 +2x +3y +1 ≡0 mod7.

6*9=54≡5. So, 5 +2x +3y +1 ≡0 →6 +2x +3y ≡0 mod7.

So, with w=9, we have three equations:

From C2: 3y + z ≡0 mod7.   (E1)

From C3: 2x + z ≡6 mod7.  (E2)

From C4: 2x +3y ≡1 mod7.  (E3)  Because 6 mod7 is 6, and 0-6= -6≡1 mod7.

Additionally, C1 is 6 +2x +3y +z ≡0 mod7. (E4)

Wait, but with w=9, let's see what E1, E2, E3, and E4 are.

Wait, E1: 3y + z ≡0 mod7.

E2: 2x + z ≡6 mod7.

E3: 2x +3y ≡1 mod7.

E4: 6 +2x +3y +z ≡0 mod7.

Wait, maybe if we can express z from E1: z ≡ -3y mod7.

Similarly, from E2: z ≡6 -2x mod7.

So, z ≡ -3y mod7 and z ≡6 -2x mod7. So,

-3y ≡6 -2x mod7.

Multiply both sides by (-1): 3y ≡ -6 +2x mod7.

Simplify -6: it is 1 mod7 (since -6 +7=1). So,

3y ≡1 +2x mod7.   (E5)

Similarly, from E3: 2x +3y ≡1 mod7.

So, E3 is 2x +3y ≡1 mod7, which is the same as E5. So, E5 and E3 are the same equation. So, that's consistent.

Thus, with w=9, we have the equations:

z ≡ -3y mod7,

z ≡6 -2x mod7,

and 2x +3y ≡1 mod7.

So, now, we can proceed to express variables in terms of others.

Let me try to express z from E1: z ≡ (-3y) mod7.

Similarly, E2: z ≡6 -2x mod7.

Therefore, equating both expressions for z:

-3y ≡6 -2x mod7 ⇒ 2x -3y ≡6 mod7.

But from E3, which is 2x +3y ≡1 mod7.

So, we have two equations:

1. 2x -3y ≡6 mod7.

2. 2x +3y ≡1 mod7.

We can solve these two equations for x and y.

Let me add both equations:

(2x -3y) + (2x +3y) ≡6 +1 mod7 ⇒4x ≡7 mod7 ⇒4x ≡0 mod7.

Since 7 is prime, and 4 and 7 are coprime, the solution is x ≡0 mod7.

But x is a digit, 0 ≤x ≤9, so x=0 or x=7.

Wait, but wait, 4x ≡0 mod7 ⇒x ≡0 mod7. So, possible x values are 0 and 7.

But since we're trying to maximize N, which is 9x y z, we want x to be as large as possible. So, let's try x=7 first.

Case 1: x=7.

Then, from equation 2x +3y ≡1 mod7.

2*7=14≡0 mod7. So, 0 +3y ≡1 mod7 ⇒3y ≡1 mod7.

Multiplying both sides by the inverse of 3 mod7. Since 3*5=15≡1 mod7, so inverse is 5.

Thus, y≡5*1=5 mod7. So, y=5 or y=12, but y is a digit, so y=5.

So, y=5.

Now, from E1: z ≡-3y mod7. y=5, so z≡-15 mod7. -15 mod7: 15/7=2*7=14, 15-14=1, so -15 ≡ -1 mod7 ≡6 mod7.

So, z ≡6 mod7. So, possible z=6 or 13, but z is a digit, so z=6.

So, with w=9, x=7, y=5, z=6.

Let's check if this satisfies all four conditions.

Compute N: 9756.

Now, let's check each condition.

1. Changing thousands digit to 1: 1756. Is 1756 divisible by 7?

Let's compute 1756 ÷7. 7*250=1750, 1756-1750=6, so 1756=7*250 +6. So remainder 6. Not divisible by7. Hmm, that's a problem.

Wait, so that would violate the first condition. So our assumption is wrong.

Wait, but according to our equations, this should satisfy all conditions. Maybe I made a
