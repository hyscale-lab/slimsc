Okay, so I have this math problem to solve. Let me read it again and make sure I understand it correctly.

The problem says: Let N be the greatest four-digit positive integer with the property that whenever one of its digits is changed to 1, the resulting number is divisible by 7. Then, Q and R are the quotient and remainder when N is divided by 1000. I need to find Q + R.

Hmm, okay. So N is a four-digit number, meaning it's between 1000 and 9999. The key property is that if you change any one of its digits to 1, the new number becomes divisible by 7. And I need the greatest such number N. Once I find N, I divide it by 1000, get Q and R, then add them together.

Let me try to break this down. First, understanding the property: changing any single digit of N to 1 results in a number divisible by 7. So, for example, if N is ABCD, then changing A to 1 gives 1BCD, changing B to 1 gives A1CD, changing C to 1 gives AB1D, and changing D to 1 gives ABC1. Each of these numbers must be divisible by 7.

My goal is to find the largest possible N with this property. So I probably need to maximize N by looking at its digits, maybe starting from the thousands place and working down.

Let me denote N as a four-digit number: N = 1000a + 100b + 10c + d, where a, b, c, d are digits from 0 to 9, and a is at least 1 since it's a four-digit number.

The condition is that replacing any digit with 1 gives a number divisible by 7. So, for each digit position, replacing it with 1 must result in a number divisible by 7.

Let's formalize this:

1. Replacing the thousands digit a with 1: 1000*1 + 100b + 10c + d = 1000 + 100b + 10c + d must be divisible by 7.
2. Replacing the hundreds digit b with 1: 1000a + 100*1 + 10c + d = 1000a + 100 + 10c + d must be divisible by 7.
3. Replacing the tens digit c with 1: 1000a + 100b + 10*1 + d = 1000a + 100b + 10 + d must be divisible by 7.
4. Replacing the units digit d with 1: 1000a + 100b + 10c + 1 must be divisible by 7.

So, all four of these modified numbers must be divisible by 7. Therefore, each modified number is congruent to 0 mod 7.

Let me think about each condition separately.

First, let's consider condition 1: 1000 + 100b + 10c + d ≡ 0 mod 7.

Similarly, condition 2: 1000a + 100 + 10c + d ≡ 0 mod 7.

Condition 3: 1000a + 100b + 10 + d ≡ 0 mod 7.

Condition 4: 1000a + 100b + 10c + 1 ≡ 0 mod 7.

Hmm. Maybe I can compute each of these expressions mod 7 and set them equal to 0. Then, perhaps find relationships between a, b, c, d.

But before that, maybe it's useful to know what 1000, 100, 10, 1 are mod 7.

Calculating each:

1000 mod 7: Let's compute 1000 /7. 7*142=994. So 1000 - 994 =6. So 1000 ≡6 mod7.

Similarly, 100 mod7: 7*14=98, so 100-98=2, so 100≡2 mod7.

10 mod7 is 3, because 10-7=3.

1 mod7 is 1.

So we can rewrite each condition as:

1. 6 + 2b + 3c + d ≡0 mod7.

2. 6a +2 +3c +d ≡0 mod7.

3. 6a +2b +3 +d ≡0 mod7.

4. 6a +2b +3c +1 ≡0 mod7.

So, these are four equations:

Equation 1: 2b +3c +d ≡ -6 mod7 → 2b +3c +d ≡1 mod7 (since -6 mod7 is 1)

Equation 2: 6a +3c +d ≡ -2 mod7 → 6a +3c +d ≡5 mod7 (since -2 mod7 is 5)

Equation 3:6a +2b +d ≡ -3 mod7 →6a +2b +d ≡4 mod7 (since -3 mod7 is 4)

Equation4:6a +2b +3c ≡-1 mod7 →6a +2b +3c ≡6 mod7 (since -1 mod7 is 6)

So, now I have four equations:

1. 2b +3c +d ≡1 (mod7)

2.6a +3c +d ≡5 (mod7)

3.6a +2b +d ≡4 (mod7)

4.6a +2b +3c ≡6 (mod7)

Hmm. That's a system of four congruences with four variables: a, b, c, d. But a, b, c, d are digits between 0 and 9, with a >=1.

I think I can solve this system step by step.

Let me see if I can subtract some equations to eliminate variables.

First, let's subtract equation1 from equation2.

Equation2 - Equation1:
(6a +3c +d) - (2b +3c +d) = (5 -1) mod7.

Simplify:

6a -2b ≡4 mod7.

Which is: 6a -2b ≡4 mod7.

We can write this as 6a ≡2b +4 mod7.

Divide both sides by 2 (since 2 and 7 are coprime, so 2 has an inverse mod7). The inverse of 2 mod7 is 4, since 2*4=8≡1 mod7.

So multiply both sides by 4:

(6a)*4 ≡ (2b +4)*4 mod7.

Compute 6*4=24≡3 mod7, so left side is 3a.

Right side: (2b)*4=8b≡1b mod7, and 4*4=16≡2 mod7. So right side is b + 2 mod7.

Thus, 3a ≡b +2 mod7.

So equation A: 3a -b ≡2 mod7.

Similarly, let's subtract equation3 from equation2.

Equation2 - Equation3:

(6a +3c +d) - (6a +2b +d) =5 -4 mod7.

Simplify:

3c -2b ≡1 mod7.

So equation B:3c -2b ≡1 mod7.

Now, equation4 is:6a +2b +3c ≡6 mod7.

Let me see if I can express equation4 in terms of other variables.

From equation A: 3a ≡b +2 mod7.

From equation B:3c ≡2b +1 mod7.

Let me see if I can express equation4 in terms of equation A and B.

Equation4: 6a +2b +3c ≡6 mod7.

From equation A: 6a = 2*(3a) ≡2*(b +2) mod7. So 6a ≡2b +4 mod7.

From equation B:3c ≡2b +1 mod7.

So equation4 becomes:

(2b +4) +2b + (2b +1) ≡6 mod7.

Wait, let me check that again.

Equation4 is 6a +2b +3c.

We have 6a ≡2b +4 mod7 from equation A.

And 3c ≡2b +1 mod7 from equation B.

So, 6a +2b +3c ≡ (2b +4) +2b + (2b +1) mod7.

Let me compute that:

2b +4 +2b +2b +1 = (2b + 2b + 2b) + (4 + 1) =6b +5.

So equation4 becomes 6b +5 ≡6 mod7.

Which means 6b ≡1 mod7.

So 6b ≡1 mod7.

We can solve for b: 6b ≡1 mod7.

Multiplying both sides by the inverse of 6 mod7. Since 6 and 7 are coprime, the inverse exists. The inverse of 6 mod7 is 6, because 6*6=36≡1 mod7.

So b ≡6*1 ≡6 mod7.

But b is a digit, so 0 ≤ b ≤9. So possible values for b are 6 and 6+7=13, but 13 is not a digit. So b=6.

So b=6.

Now that we have b=6, let's find a from equation A.

Equation A:3a -b ≡2 mod7.

So 3a -6 ≡2 mod7.

So 3a ≡8 mod7.

But 8 mod7 is 1. So 3a ≡1 mod7.

Again, we can find the inverse of 3 mod7, which is 5, because 3*5=15≡1 mod7.

So a ≡5*1 ≡5 mod7.

Since a is a digit (1-9), the possible values are a=5 or 5+7=12, but 12 is not a digit. So a=5.

So a=5, b=6.

Now, let's use equation B:3c -2b ≡1 mod7.

We have b=6, so 3c -12 ≡1 mod7.

Compute 12 mod7:12-7=5, so 12≡5 mod7.

So 3c -5 ≡1 mod7 →3c ≡6 mod7.

Multiply both sides by inverse of 3, which is 5 mod7.

c ≡6*5=30≡2 mod7.

So c=2 or 2+7=9. So possible c=2 or 9.

So c can be 2 or 9.

Now, let's use equation1:2b +3c +d ≡1 mod7.

We have b=6, c=2 or9.

Case 1: c=2.

Equation1:2*6 +3*2 +d ≡1 mod7.

Compute:12 +6 +d =18 +d.

18 mod7: 7*2=14, 18-14=4. So 4 +d ≡1 mod7.

So d ≡1 -4= -3 ≡4 mod7.

So d=4 or 4+7=11 (invalid), so d=4.

Case 2: c=9.

Equation1:2*6 +3*9 +d =12 +27 +d =39 +d.

39 mod7: 7*5=35, 39-35=4. So 4 +d ≡1 mod7.

So d≡1-4=-3≡4 mod7. So d=4 or 11. Only d=4 is valid.

So in both cases, c=2 or 9, d=4.

Wait, that's interesting. So regardless of c being 2 or9, d=4.

Hmm. So let's check equation2 and equation3 to see if these values hold.

Equation2:6a +3c +d ≡5 mod7.

a=5, so 6*5=30≡2 mod7 (since 30-28=2).

3c: if c=2, 3*2=6≡6 mod7. If c=9, 3*9=27≡6 mod7 (since 27-21=6).

d=4≡4 mod7.

So equation2: 2 +6 +4=12≡5 mod7. Because 12-7=5. So yes, it holds.

Equation3:6a +2b +d ≡4 mod7.

a=5, so 6*5=30≡2 mod7.

2b=2*6=12≡5 mod7.

d=4≡4 mod7.

So equation3:2 +5 +4=11≡4 mod7 (since 11-7=4). Correct.

Equation4:6a +2b +3c ≡6 mod7.

6a=30≡2, 2b=12≡5, 3c: if c=2, 6; if c=9, 27≡6. So 2 +5 +6=13≡6 mod7 (13-7=6). Correct.

So all equations hold for both c=2 and c=9, with d=4.

So now, N is a four-digit number with a=5, b=6, c=2 or9, d=4.

Therefore, the possible Ns are 5 6 2 4 and 5 6 9 4. So N could be 5624 or 5694.

But the problem states that N is the greatest four-digit positive integer with this property. So between 5624 and 5694, which is larger? 5694 is larger.

Wait, but wait: are these the only possibilities? Let me confirm.

Because c can be 2 or9, but when c=9, do all the conditions still hold? Let me check.

Wait, with a=5, b=6, c=9, d=4.

Changing any digit to 1:

- Changing a to1:1694. Is 1694 divisible by7?

Let me compute 1694 /7. 7*242=1694. Yes, because 7*240=1680, plus 7*2=14, so 1680+14=1694.

- Changing b to1:5194. Is 5194 divisible by7?

Compute 5194 ÷7. 7*742=5194? Let me check: 7*700=4900, 7*42=294, so 4900+294=5194. So yes.

- Changing c to1:5614.

Wait, 5614 ÷7. Let me compute: 7*800=5600, so 5614-5600=14, which is 7*2. So 5614=7*(800+2)=7*802. So yes, divisible by7.

- Changing d to1:5691.

5691 ÷7. 7*800=5600, 5691-5600=91. 91 is 7*13. So 5691=7*(800+13)=7*813. So yes, divisible by7.

So all four modified numbers are divisible by7.

Similarly, for N=5624:

Changing a to1:1624. 1624 ÷7=232, exactly, since 7*230=1610, 1624-1610=14, which is 7*2. So 232.

Changing b to1:5124. 5124 ÷7. 7*732=5124? Let me compute 7*700=4900, 7*32=224, so 4900+224=5124. Yes.

Changing c to1:5614, same as before, which is 7*802.

Changing d to1:5621. 5621 ÷7. 7*800=5600, 5621-5600=21. 21 is 7*3. So 5621=7*803. Correct.

So both N=5624 and N=5694 satisfy the conditions.

But since we have to choose the greatest four-digit number, between 5624 and 5694, 5694 is larger.

Wait a second, but is 5694 the largest possible? Or are there larger numbers with this property?

I think 5694 is larger than 5624, so it's better. But perhaps there is a larger N.

Wait, but let's see. Are there any four-digit numbers larger than 5694 that have this property? Let's think.

N is a four-digit number, so the maximum possible is 9999. But obviously, 9999 doesn't satisfy the condition because changing a digit to1 would result in a number that may not be divisible by7. So, the maximum N is likely 5694, but I need to confirm.

Wait, but why can't N be 7777? Let me check. Changing any digit to1, does that give a number divisible by7?

For example, changing the first digit to1:1777. 1777 ÷7 is about 253.857..., which is not an integer. 7*253=1771, 1777-1771=6. So 1777=7*253 +6. Not divisible by7. So 7777 doesn't work.

Similarly, let's think if higher numbers could satisfy the conditions.

Wait, but if N is the maximum four-digit number, it's probably starting with 9. But 9xyz. But changing the first digit to1 would give 1xyz, which may not be divisible by7.

Alternatively, maybe the thousands digit is as high as possible, 9, but perhaps, but let's see.

Wait, but given the system of congruences, we found that a=5, b=6, c=2 or9, d=4. So N must start with5, right? Because from the equations, a=5 is the only possibility, since a=5 is the only digit that satisfies 3a ≡1 mod7.

Wait, no, because a=5 is the solution in mod7. So a could be 5 or 12, but since a is a digit, a=5 is the only possibility.

So the thousands digit is fixed at5. So N must be in the 5000s. So the maximum N is 5694.

Wait, but wait, maybe a can be 5 +7=12? But 12 is not a digit. So a=5 is the only possible.

Therefore, the maximum N is 5694.

So Q is the quotient when N is divided by 1000, which is 5, and R is the remainder, which is 694.

So Q + R =5 +694=699.

Wait, but let me double-check: 5694 divided by1000 is 5 with remainder 694, yes.

So the answer is 5 +694=699.

But wait, let me make sure I didn't miss any larger N. For example, could there be a higher N in the 5000s that satisfies the condition?

Wait, if a=5, b=6, c=9, d=4 gives N=5694, which is the highest possible in the 5600s. But is there a higher N, say, 5694 is the highest, but 5695 or 5696 might not satisfy the conditions.

Wait, but let me think: the maximum N is 5694 because if I try to make c=9, d=5, but then equation1 would require that 1695 is divisible by7. Let me check 1695 ÷7: 7*242=1694, so 1695=7*242+1, which is not divisible by7. So d cannot be 5, it must be4.

So N=5694 is the maximum.

Alternatively, if a=5, b=6, c=9, d=4, as we found, that's the largest possible.

Therefore, the answer is 5 +694=699.


To solve the problem, we need to find the greatest four-digit number \( N \) such that changing any one of its digits to 1 results in a number divisible by 7. We then compute \( Q + R \) where \( Q \) is the quotient and \( R \) is the remainder when \( N \) is divided by 1000.

1. **Expressing the Problem with Congruences**:
   - Let \( N = 1000a + 100b + 10c + d \) where \( a, b, c, d \) are digits.
   - Changing any digit to 1 results in a number divisible by 7, leading to four congruences:
     - \( 6 + 2b + 3c + d \equiv 0 \pmod{7} \)
     - \( 6a + 2 + 3c + d \equiv 0 \pmod{7} \)
     - \( 6a + 2b + 3 + d \equiv 0 \pmod{7} \)
     - \( 6a + 2b + 3c + 1 \equiv 0 \pmod{7} \)

2. **Solving the System of Congruences**:
   - By manipulating the equations, we find:
     - \( 3a - b \equiv 2 \pmod{7} \)
     - \( 3c - 2b \equiv 1 \pmod{7} \)
     - \( 6b + 5 \equiv 6 \pmod{7} \) leading to \( b = 6 \).
     - Substituting \( b = 6 \), we find \( a = 5 \) and \( c \) can be 2 or 9.
     - For both \( c = 2 \) and \( c = 9 \), \( d = 4 \).

3. **Determining the Greatest \( N \)**:
   - The possible values for \( N \) are 5624 and 5694. The larger of these is 5694.

4. **Calculating \( Q + R \)**:
   - Dividing 5694 by 1000 gives \( Q = 5 \) and \( R = 694 \).
   - Therefore, \( Q + R = 5 + 694 = 699 \).

The final answer is \(\boxed{699}\).
