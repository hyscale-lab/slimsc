Okay, so I've got this problem here about rectangular boxes with a surface area of 54 and a volume of 23. I need to find the radius of the smallest sphere that can contain any of these boxes, then take r squared, express it as a fraction p/q where p and q are coprime, and find p + q. Hmm, that sounds a bit involved, but let me try to break it down.

First, let's think about the boxes. A rectangular box has three dimensions: length, width, and height. Let me call them x, y, and z. The surface area of a box is given by 2(xy + yz + xz) and the volume is xyz. So, the problem tells me that 2(xy + yz + xz) = 54 and xyz = 23.

I need to find the smallest sphere that can contain such a box. The sphere that can contain a rectangular box must have a diameter equal to the space diagonal of the box. The space diagonal d of a box with sides x, y, z is sqrt(x² + y² + z²). Therefore, the radius r of the sphere is half of that, so r = d/2. So, r² would be (x² + y² + z²)/4. That's what I need to find.

So, the problem reduces to minimizing (x² + y² + z²)/4 given that 2(xy + yz + xz) = 54 and xyz = 23.

Wait, but how do I relate these equations? Maybe I can use some algebraic identities or optimization techniques. Let me recall that (x + y + z)² = x² + y² + z² + 2(xy + yz + xz). Since I know 2(xy + yz + xz) is 54, that means (xy + yz + xz) is 27. So, (x + y + z)² = x² + y² + z² + 54. Therefore, x² + y² + z² = (x + y + z)² - 54. So, if I can find (x + y + z), then I can get x² + y² + z².

But how does that help me? Well, I also have the volume constraint xyz = 23. So, I have three variables x, y, z with two equations: one for their sum of products (xy + yz + xz = 27) and another for their product (xyz = 23). It seems like I might need to use some optimization methods here, perhaps Lagrange multipliers? Or maybe I can express two variables in terms of the third and then minimize.

Let me think about symmetry. The minimal sphere should correspond to the case where the box is as close to a cube as possible because a cube minimizes the space diagonal for a given volume. But wait, is that always the case? Or is there a way to confirm that?

Alternatively, maybe I can use the method of Lagrange multipliers to minimize f(x, y, z) = x² + y² + z² subject to the constraints g(x, y, z) = 2(xy + yz + xz) - 54 = 0 and h(x, y, z) = xyz - 23 = 0.

Yes, that sounds like a solid approach. So, setting up the Lagrangian function:

L = x² + y² + z² - λ(2(xy + yz + xz) - 54) - μ(xyz - 23)

Taking partial derivatives with respect to x, y, z, λ, μ and setting them to zero.

Partial derivative with respect to x:

2x - λ(2y + 2z) - μ(yz) = 0

Similarly, partial derivative with respect to y:

2y - λ(2x + 2z) - μ(xz) = 0

Partial derivative with respect to z:

2z - λ(2x + 2y) - μ(xy) = 0

And the constraints:

2(xy + yz + xz) = 54 --> (xy + yz + xz) = 27

xyz = 23

So, now I have a system of five equations:

1. 2x - 2λ(y + z) - μyz = 0

2. 2y - 2λ(x + z) - μxz = 0

3. 2z - 2λ(x + y) - μxy = 0

4. xy + yz + xz = 27

5. xyz = 23

Hmm, this looks complicated, but maybe I can find a relationship between x, y, z. If I subtract equation 1 from equation 2, I get:

(2y - 2λ(x + z) - μxz) - (2x - 2λ(y + z) - μyz) = 0

Simplify:

2y - 2x - 2λx + 2λy - μxz + μyz = 0

Factor terms:

2(y - x) + 2λ(y - x) + μz(y - x) = 0

Factor out (y - x):

(y - x)(2 + 2λ + μz) = 0

So, either y = x or 2 + 2λ + μz = 0. Similarly, subtracting equation 2 from equation 3:

2z - 2x - 2λx + 2λz - μxy + μxz =0

Wait, maybe that's getting too messy. Alternatively, perhaps I can assume that the minimal sphere occurs when the box is a cube, so x = y = z. Let me check if that's possible.

If x = y = z, then surface area 2(xy + yz + xz) would be 2(3x²) = 6x² =54, so x² = 9, x=3. Then volume would be x³=27. But the volume given here is 23, which is less than 27. So, the cube case doesn't satisfy the volume constraint. Therefore, the minimal sphere must correspond to a box that's not a cube.

Hmm. Alternatively, maybe the minimal x² + y² + z² occurs when two variables are
