Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the number of triples of nonnegative integers (a, b, c) that satisfy two conditions: a + b + c = 300 and a²b + a²c + b²a + b²c + c²a + c²b = 6,000,000.

Hmm, let me try to break this down. First, the equation a + b + c = 300 is straightforward—it's the sum of the three variables. The second equation looks more complicated, but maybe I can factor or simplify it somehow.

Looking at the second equation: a²b + a²c + b²a + b²c + c²a + c²b. I notice that each term is a product of two variables where one is squared. Maybe I can factor this expression.

Let me see: a²b + a²c = a²(b + c). Similarly, b²a + b²c = b²(a + c), and c²a + c²b = c²(a + b). So the entire expression can be rewritten as a²(b + c) + b²(a + c) + c²(a + b).

Now, since a + b + c = 300, I can express each of these (b + c), (a + c), and (a + b) in terms of the total sum.

Specifically:
- b + c = 300 - a
- a + c = 300 - b
- a + b = 300 - c

So substituting these into the expression, we get:

a²(300 - a) + b²(300 - b) + c²(300 - c) = 6,000,000.

Let me write that out:

a²(300 - a) + b²(300 - b) + c²(300 - c) = 6,000,000.

Hmm, that's a bit simpler. Let me denote S = a + b + c = 300. So the equation becomes:

a²(S - a) + b²(S - b) + c²(S - c) = 6,000,000.

But S is 300, so it's:

300a² - a³ + 300b² - b³ + 300c² - c³ = 6,000,000.

I can rearrange this as:

300(a² + b² + c²) - (a³ + b³ + c³) = 6,000,000.

Hmm, perhaps I can express a² + b² + c² and a³ + b³ + c³ in terms of other symmetric sums.

I remember that for three variables:

(a + b + c)² = a² + b² + c² + 2(ab + bc + ac).

Since a + b + c = 300, then (300)² = a² + b² + c² + 2(ab + bc + ac).

So, 90,000 = a² + b² + c² + 2(ab + bc + ac).

Let me denote P = ab + bc + ac. Then,

a² + b² + c² = 90,000 - 2P.

Substituting back into the earlier equation:

300(a² + b² + c²) - (a³ + b³ + c³) = 6,000,000.

So,

300(90,000 - 2P) - (a³ + b³ + c³) = 6,000,000.

Let me compute that:

300 * 90,000 = 27,000,000.

300 * (-2P) = -600P.

So,

27,000,000 - 600P - (a³ + b³ + c³) = 6,000,000.

Rearranging:

27,000,000 - 6,000,000 = 600P + (a³ + b³ + c³).

Which is:

21,000,000 = 600P + (a³ + b³ + c³).

Hmm, so now I have another equation involving P and the sum of cubes. I need another relation to connect these.

Wait, I also remember that for three variables, the sum of cubes can be expressed as:

a³ + b³ + c³ = (a + b + c)^3 - 3(a + b + c)(ab + bc + ac) + 3abc.

Substituting S = 300, P = ab + bc + ac, and Q = abc, we get:

a³ + b³ + c³ = 300³ - 3*300*P + 3Q.

Compute 300³: 300*300=90,000; 90,000*300=27,000,000.

So,

a³ + b³ + c³ = 27,000,000 - 900P + 3Q.

Substituting this back into the equation 21,000,000 = 600P + (a³ + b³ + c³):

21,000,000 = 600P + (27,000,000 - 900P + 3Q).

Simplify:

21,000,000 = 27,000,000 - 300P + 3Q.

Bring 27,000,000 to the left:

21,000,000 - 27,000,000 = -300P + 3Q.

Which is:

-6,000,000 = -300P + 3Q.

Divide both sides by 3:

-2,000,000 = -100P + Q.

So,

Q = 100P - 2,000,000.

Hmm, okay, so we've got Q in terms of P. Now, let's recap what we have so far.

We have:

1. a + b + c = 300 = S.
2. ab + bc + ac = P.
3. abc = Q = 100P - 2,000,000.

Also, from earlier:

a² + b² + c² = 90,000 - 2P.

But I don't know if that's directly useful yet.

So, we have a system of equations based on symmetric sums. Since a, b, c are nonnegative integers, perhaps we can model this as a cubic equation whose roots are a, b, c. Let me think.

Let me recall that for a cubic equation x³ - Sx² + Px - Q = 0, the roots are a, b, c. So, the equation would be:

x³ - 300x² + Px - Q = 0.

And from earlier, Q = 100P - 2,000,000.

So, substituting Q into the equation:

x³ - 300x² + Px - (100P - 2,000,000) = 0.

Simplify:

x³ - 300x² + Px - 100P + 2,000,000 = 0.

Hmm, maybe factor terms with P:

x³ - 300x² + 2,000,000 + P(x - 100) = 0.

Hmm, interesting. So, equation becomes:

(x³ - 300x² + 2,000,000) + P(x - 100) = 0.

If I can write it as:

P(x - 100) = - (x³ - 300x² + 2,000,000).

But P is the sum ab + bc + ac, which is a symmetric function of a, b, c. So, perhaps all the roots a, b, c must satisfy this equation.

Alternatively, maybe I can find possible values of P that make Q an integer, given that a, b, c are integers.

Wait, but Q must be an integer since a, b, c are integers. So, Q = 100P - 2,000,000 must be an integer, which it will be if P is an integer.

So, perhaps I can look for integer solutions P such that the cubic equation has three non-negative integer roots a, b, c.

But this seems a bit vague. Maybe another approach. Let me think about the values of a, b, c.

Given that a + b + c = 300
