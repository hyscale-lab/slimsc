Okay, so I have this math problem about a torus and a sphere. Hmm, let me try to visualize it. The torus is created by revolving a circle with radius 3 around an axis that's 6 units away from the center of the circle. So, it's like a donut shape. The sphere S has a radius of 11.

The problem says when the torus rests inside the sphere, it's internally tangent along a circle with radius r_i, and when it rests outside, it's externally tangent along a circle with radius r_o. I need to find the difference r_i - r_o and express it as a fraction m/n, then find m + n.

Alright, let's break this down. First, I should recall some properties of tori and spheres.

A torus can be defined by two radii: the major radius R, which is the distance from the center of the generating circle to the axis of revolution, and the minor radius r, which is the radius of the generating circle. In this case, the minor radius is 3, and the major radius is 6. So, R = 6, r = 3.

Now, when the torus is inside the sphere, it's tangent along a circle. Similarly, when it's outside, it's tangent along another circle. I need to find the radii of these circles of tangency, r_i and r_o.

Let me think about the internal tangent case first. The torus is inside the sphere, so the sphere has a larger radius, 11. The torus must touch the sphere at exactly one circle. To find the radius of that circle, I should consider the geometry of their intersection.

Wait, maybe I should model both the sphere and the torus as surfaces in 3D space. The sphere is straightforward: all points at distance 11 from the center. The torus is a bit trickier. Its equation in 3D can be written in terms of coordinates, but perhaps there's a simpler way using the major and minor radii.

Alternatively, maybe I can think about the centers. When the torus is inside the sphere, the center of the sphere is offset from the center of the torus's generating circle. Wait, noâ€”the sphere is just a sphere, but the torus is a surface. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to think in terms
