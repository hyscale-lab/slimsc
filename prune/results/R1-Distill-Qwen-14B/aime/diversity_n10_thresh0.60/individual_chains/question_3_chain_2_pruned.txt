Okay, so I've got this probability problem to solve. Let me read it again carefully.

Jen is entering a lottery by picking 4 distinct numbers from the set S = {1,2,3,...,10}. Then, 4 numbers are randomly chosen from S. She wins a prize if at least two of her numbers match two of the randomly chosen numbers. She wins the grand prize if all four of her numbers are the ones chosen. The question is about the probability that she wins the grand prize given that she won a prize. This probability is given as m/n where m and n are coprime positive integers, and I need to find m + n.

Alright, so probability problems can often be approached using combinations since we're dealing with selections without order. Let me break down the problem into parts.

First, the sample space is choosing 4 numbers out of 10, so the total number of possible combinations is C(10,4). Jen picks a specific set of 4 numbers, and then another set of 4 is drawn randomly. The probability of winning the grand prize is when both sets are identical.

But the problem here is conditional probability. We're given that she won a prize (i.e., at least two of her numbers were chosen), and we need the probability that she actually won the grand prize under that condition.

So, mathematically, we're looking for P(Grand Prize | At Least Two Correct). Which can be written as:

P(GP | A) = P(GP and A) / P(A)

But since winning the grand prize is a subset of having at least two correct numbers (in fact, it's the case where all four are correct), this simplifies to:

P(GP | A) = P(GP) / P(A)

So, I need to compute two probabilities: the probability of winning the grand prize, and the probability of winning at least two correct numbers.

Let me compute each part.

First, compute P(GP). The number of ways to choose all four correct numbers: there's only one such combination (Jen's specific set of four). So,

P(GP) = 1 / C(10,4)

Wait, actually, no. Wait, the total number of possible lottery draws is C(10,4), right? So, since Jen has one specific set, the probability that the lottery draw matches her set is 1 / C(10,4).

But let me compute C(10,4): that's 10! / (4! * 6!) = (10*9*8*7)/(4*3*2*1) = 210. So, P(GP) = 1/210.

Now, compute P(A), the probability of winning at least two correct numbers. Winning at least two correct means she has exactly two, exactly three, or exactly four correct numbers. So, P(A) is the sum of the probabilities of these three events.

So, let's compute the number of ways for exactly k correct numbers, where k = 2, 3, 4.

For exactly k correct numbers, the number of such combinations is C(4,k) * C(6, 4 -k). Here, C(4,k) is choosing k correct numbers from Jen's 4, and C(6, 4 -k) is choosing the remaining (4 -k) numbers from the 6 numbers not in Jen's set.

Wait, is that correct? Let me think. The total numbers in S is 10. Jen has 4, so the other 6 are not in her set. The lottery chooses 4 numbers, which can include some of Jen's and some not.

So, for exactly k correct numbers:

Number of favorable combinations = C(4,k) * C(6,4 -k)

So, the probability for exactly k correct is [C(4,k) * C(6,4 -k)] / C(10,4)

So, let me compute for each k:

For k=2: C(4,2) * C(6,2) = 6 * 15 = 90

For k=3: C(4,3) * C(6,1) = 4 * 6 = 24

For k=4: C(4,4) * C(6,0) = 1 * 1 = 1

So, total number of favorable combinations for A is 90 + 24 + 1 = 115.

Therefore, P(A) = 115 / 210

Wait, let me verify that. Wait, C(4,2) is 6, C(6,2) is 15, so 6*15=90. C(4,3)=4, C(6,1)=6
