Okay, so I have this geometry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again and understand what's being asked.

We have three points: O at (0,0), A at (1/2, 0), and B at (0, sqrt(3)/2). Then there's this family of segments F, which are segments PQ of unit length lying in the first quadrant. P is on the x-axis, and Q is on the y-axis. So each PQ is a line segment starting on the x-axis and ending on the y-axis, with length 1.

The problem says there's a unique point C on AB, distinct from A and B, that doesn't belong to any segment from F except for AB itself. We need to find OC², which is the square of the distance from the origin to point C, and express it as a reduced fraction p/q, then find p + q.

Alright, let's visualize this first. Points O, A, and B form a triangle. O is the origin, A is halfway along the x-axis between O and (1,0), and B is somewhere along the y-axis. Let me compute the distance from O to B. Since it's (0, sqrt(3)/2), the distance is sqrt( (0)^2 + (sqrt(3)/2)^2 ) = sqrt(3/4) = sqrt(3)/2. So OB is sqrt(3)/2. Similarly, OA is 1/2.

Wait, so OA is 1/2 and OB is sqrt(3)/2. So triangle OAB is a right triangle? Let me check. The coordinates are O(0,0), A(1/2, 0), and B(0, sqrt(3)/2). So OA is along x-axis, OB is along y-axis, and AB connects (1/2, 0) to (0, sqrt(3)/2). So yes, triangle OAB is a right triangle with legs OA and OB, and hypotenuse AB.

Let me calculate the length of AB. Using the distance formula: sqrt( (1/2 - 0)^2 + (0 - sqrt(3)/2)^2 ) = sqrt(1/4 + 3/4) = sqrt(1) = 1. So AB is a unit length as well. Interesting, so AB is a unit segment from A to B, both of which are points on the axes, and AB is the hypotenuse of the right triangle OAB.

Now, the family F consists of all segments PQ of unit length in the first quadrant, with P on the x-axis and Q on the y-axis. So each PQ is like a line segment from some point (p, 0) on the x-axis to some point (0, q) on the y-axis, such that the distance between P and Q is 1. So for each PQ in F, we have sqrt(p² + q²) = 1, because the distance between (p,0) and (0,q) is sqrt(p² + q²).

But wait, each PQ is a unit segment, so p² + q² = 1. So the set of all such points (p, q) lie on the unit circle in the first quadrant. Therefore, each PQ is a chord of the unit circle from the x-axis to the y-axis, but only in the first quadrant.

But not necessarily the entire chord, just the segment from (p,0) to (0,q). So each PQ is such a segment.

So F is all these segments PQ with p>0, q>0, and p² + q² = 1.

Now, we need to find a point C on AB, other than A and B, that is not on any other segment from F except AB itself. So C is on AB, and for any other segment PQ in F (i.e., PQ not equal to AB), C is not on PQ.

So, we need to find the point C on AB such that no other PQ in F passes through C. So C is only on AB and no other PQ from F.

We need to find such a C, compute OC², and then give p + q where OC² = p/q.

Hmm. So perhaps C is the point on AB where the envelope of all these segments PQ touches AB. So, the envelope of the family F is the curve that is tangent to each PQ, and the point C is where the envelope is tangent to AB.

Alternatively, perhaps C is the point where AB is intersected by the envelope of F. So, the envelope of the family F is the curve that touches each PQ at exactly one point, and where AB intersects this envelope is the point C.

I think I need to find the envelope of the family of lines PQ, parameterized by p and q such that p² + q² = 1. So, each PQ has an equation, and the envelope is found by solving for the condition that a point lies on infinitely many PQs, which relates to the derivative condition.

Wait, the envelope of a family of curves is found by solving the system of equations given by the curve equation and the derivative with respect to the parameter set to zero.

In this case, the family of lines PQ can be parameterized, perhaps by an angle or something else.

Let me think. Each PQ is a line segment from (p, 0) to (0, q), with p² + q² = 1. So, for each PQ, the line can be written as x/p + y/q = 1. Since p² + q² =1, we can write q = sqrt(1 - p²), but that might complicate things.

Alternatively, perhaps parameterize by an angle θ. Let me imagine that the point P is (cosθ, 0) and Q is (0, sinθ), since p = cosθ, q = sinθ, and p² + q² =1. Then PQ is the line segment from (cosθ, 0) to (0, sinθ), and the line equation is x / cosθ + y / sinθ = 1.

So, for each θ in (0, π/2), the line PQ is x / cosθ + y / sinθ = 1.

So, the family of lines is x / cosθ + y / sinθ = 1, θ ∈ (0, π/2).

The envelope of this family is found by solving the system:

1. x / cosθ + y / sinθ = 1
2. The derivative of this equation with respect to θ is zero.

Let me compute the derivative of the left-hand side with respect to θ.

So, d/dθ [x / cosθ + y / sinθ] = x * sinθ / cos²θ + y * (-cosθ) / sin²θ.

Set this derivative equal to zero:

x * sinθ / cos²θ - y * cosθ / sin²θ = 0.

Let me write that as:

x sinθ / cos²θ = y cosθ / sin²θ

Multiply both sides by cos²θ sin²θ to eliminate denominators:

x sin³θ = y cos³θ

So:

x / y = cos³θ / sin³θ = (cosθ / sinθ)^3 = cot³θ

So, x / y = cot³θ.

Hmm, so from the first equation, x / cosθ + y / sinθ = 1.

Let me denote t = θ for simplicity.

We have:

x = (cos t) * (1 - y / sin t)

Wait, perhaps it's better to express variables in terms of θ.

Let me express x and y in terms of θ.

From equation 1:

x = cos t (1 - y / sin t)

From equation 2:

x / y = cot³ t => x = y cot³ t

So, substituting x from equation 2 into equation 1:

y cot³ t = cos t (1 - y /
