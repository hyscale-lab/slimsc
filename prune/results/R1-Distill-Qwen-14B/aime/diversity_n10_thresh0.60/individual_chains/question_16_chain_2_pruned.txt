Alright, I've got this math problem to solve, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again.

The problem says: Let p be the least prime number for which there exists a positive integer n such that n⁴ + 1 is divisible by p². Then, I need to find the least positive integer m such that m⁴ + 1 is divisible by p².

Hmm, okay. So I need to find the smallest prime p where n⁴ ≡ -1 mod p² is possible for some n. Once I find that p, then I have to find the smallest m that satisfies the same condition for p².

First, let me recall some number theory concepts. I remember that for primes p, if -1 is a quartic residue modulo p, then there exists an n such that n⁴ ≡ -1 mod p. But here, the condition is modulo p². So, I think I need to find primes p where this congruence holds for some n, and p² divides n⁴ + 1.

I also remember that for primes p where p ≡ 1 mod 4, -1 is a quadratic residue. But here it's a quartic residue. So, maybe primes where p ≡ 1 mod 8? Because the multiplicative group mod p is cyclic and has order p-1, so for -1 to be a quartic residue, the order of -1 in the multiplicative group must divide (p-1)/4 or something like that? Maybe I should think more carefully.

Wait, in the multiplicative group mod p, which is cyclic of order p-1, an element g has order k if g^k ≡ 1 mod p. So, for -1 to be a quartic residue, there should exist some x such that x⁴ ≡ -1 mod p. Then, (-1) must be in the subgroup generated by g^4, which is the set of quartic residues.

The order of -1 is 2, because (-1)^2 = 1. So, for -1 to be a quartic residue, 2 must divide the order of the subgroup of quartic residues, which is (p-1)/4. So, (p-1)/4 must be even, which implies that p ≡ 1 mod 8.

Wait, but maybe I'm getting ahead of myself. Let
