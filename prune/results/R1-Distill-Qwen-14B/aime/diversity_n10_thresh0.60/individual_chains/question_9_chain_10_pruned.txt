Okay, so I have this logarithm problem to solve. Let me see. The problem says that there exist real numbers x and y, both greater than 1, such that log base x of y^x equals 10, and log base y of x^{4y} also equals 10. I need to find the product xy.

Hmm, logarithms can sometimes be tricky, but I remember some properties that might help here. Let me write down what I know.

First, the given equations are:

1. log_x(y^x) = 10
2. log_y(x^{4y}) = 10

I need to solve for x and y, both greater than 1, and then find their product.

Let me recall the logarithm power rule: log_b(a^k) = k * log_b(a). So I can apply that to both equations.

Starting with the first equation: log_x(y^x) = 10.

Applying the power rule: x * log_x(y) = 10.

Wait, so x multiplied by log base x of y equals 10. But log base x of y is equal to (ln y)/(ln x), right? Because log_b(a) = ln a / ln b.

So, substituting that in, we get:

x * (ln y / ln x) = 10.

Hmm, that's one equation. Let me write that as equation (1):

x * (ln y / ln x) = 10.  (1)

Now, moving on to the second equation: log_y(x^{4y}) = 10.

Again, applying the power rule: 4y * log_y(x) = 10.

Similarly, log_y(x) is equal to (ln x)/(ln y). So substituting that in, we have:

4y * (ln x / ln y) = 10. (2)

So now, I have two equations:

1. x * (ln y / ln x) = 10
2. 4y * (ln x / ln y) = 10

Let me see if I can manipulate these equations to find a relationship between x and y.

Looking at equation (1):

x * (ln y / ln x) = 10

Let me denote (ln y / ln x) as a variable to simplify. Let me call it a. So, a = ln y / ln x.

Then equation (1) becomes x * a = 10.

Similarly, equation (2):

4y * (ln x / ln y) = 10

But ln x / ln y is the reciprocal of a. So, (ln x / ln y) = 1/a.

So equation (2) becomes 4y * (1/a) = 10.

So now, in terms of a, the equations are:

1. x * a = 10
2. 4y / a = 10

So, from equation (1): x = 10 / a.

From equation (2): 4y = 10a => y = (10a)/4 = (5a)/2.

So now, I have expressions for x and y in terms of a: x = 10/a and y = (5a)/2.

But I also know that a = ln y / ln x.

So, substituting x and y in terms of a into this expression for a:

a = ln[(5a)/2] / ln(10/a)

So, now I have an equation in terms of a only:

a = [ln((5a)/2)] / [ln(10/a)]

Hmm, that seems a bit complex, but perhaps I can simplify it.

Let me write this equation as:

a = ln(5a/2) / ln(10/a)

Let me compute the numerator and the denominator separately.

Numerator: ln(5a/2) = ln(5a) - ln 2 = ln5 + ln a - ln2.

Denominator: ln(10/a) = ln10 - ln a.

So, a = [ln5 + ln a - ln2] / [ln10 - ln a]

Hmm, that's a bit messy, but maybe I can rearrange terms.

Let me denote A = ln a, B = ln5, C = ln2, D = ln10.

So, equation becomes:

a = [B + A - C] / [D - A]

But I'm not sure if that substitution helps. Maybe I should cross-multiply to get rid of the denominator.

So, cross-multiplying:

a * (ln10 - ln a) = ln(5a/2)

Hmm, let's compute the left side:

a * (ln10 - ln a) = a ln10 - a ln a.

Right side: ln(5a/2) = ln5 + ln a - ln2.

So, equation:

a ln10 - a ln a = ln5 + ln a - ln2.

Hmm, let's bring all terms to one side:

a ln10 - a ln a - ln5 - ln a + ln2 = 0.

Let me group similar terms:

(a ln10) + (-a ln a - ln a) + (-ln5 + ln2) = 0.

Factor out ln a:

a ln10 - (a + 1) ln a + (-ln5 + ln2) = 0.

Hmm, this still looks complicated. Maybe we can collect like terms differently.

Wait, perhaps I can factor out ln a from the first two terms.

Wait, let's see:

a ln10 - a ln a - ln a - ln5 + ln2 = 0.

So, group terms with ln a:

= a ln10 - (a + 1) ln a - ln5 + ln2 = 0.

Not sure if that's helpful. Maybe it's better to try a substitution or think of another approach.

Alternatively, perhaps I can let t = ln a. Then, ln a = t, so a = e^t.

So, substituting into the equation:

a ln10 - (a + 1) ln a - ln5 + ln2 = 0

becomes:

e^t ln10 - (e^t + 1) t - ln5 + ln2 = 0.

Hmm, now that's a transcendental equation, which may not have an algebraic solution. That complicates things. Maybe I need to find a smart substitution or realize that a is a nice number.

Alternatively, perhaps I can make an intelligent guess for the value of a, given that x and y are both greater than 1.

Wait, let me think. Since x and y are greater than 1, and a = ln y / ln x.

If x and y are both greater than 1, then ln x and ln y are positive. So a is positive.

Hmm, but maybe there's a way to express a in terms that can cancel terms.

Wait, from my previous equations:

x = 10 / a

y = (5a) / 2

So, since x and y are both greater than 1, we have:

10 / a > 1 => a < 10.

Similarly, y = (5a)/2 > 1 => 5a/2 > 1 => a > 2
