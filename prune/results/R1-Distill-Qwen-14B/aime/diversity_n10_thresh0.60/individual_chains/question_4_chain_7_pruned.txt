Okay, so I've got this problem where Alice and Bob are playing a game with a stack of n tokens. They take turns removing either 1 or 4 tokens, and the person who takes the last token wins. I need to find how many positive integers n ≤ 2024 allow Bob to have a winning strategy, no matter how Alice plays.

Hmm, let's break this down. It sounds like a classic combinatorial game theory problem. The key here is to figure out the losing positions—positions where no matter what move you make, you leave the opponent in a winning position. If Bob can force Alice into a losing position on her first turn, then Bob can win. So, I need to figure out for which n Bob can do that.

Let me start by trying to model the game. Let's think about small values of n and see who would win in those cases. Maybe I can find a pattern.

n=1: Alice takes the token and wins. So, Bob can't win here.
n=2: Alice can take 1 token, leaving 1 for Bob, who then takes it and wins. Wait, no—wait, no. Wait, if Alice takes 1 from n=2, leaving 1, then Bob takes the last one and wins. But Alice wants to win, so she'll take all 2 tokens? Wait, no, because the allowed moves are only 1 or 4 tokens. She can't take 2. So, from n=2, Alice can only take 1, leaving n=1 for Bob, who then takes it and wins. So Alice can't win, so Bob can. So n=2 is a losing position for Alice, meaning Bob can win.

Wait, no—wait. Let me try to clarify. If n=1: Alice takes 1, wins. So for n=1, Alice wins. For n=2: Alice can take 1, leaving n=1 for Bob. But then Bob can take the last one and win. So in that case, Alice would lose. Alternatively, Alice can't take 2 because that's not allowed. So when n=2, Alice is forced to leave 1 for Bob, who then wins. So n=2 is a losing position for Alice, meaning Bob can win.

Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of winning and losing positions. Let's define a
