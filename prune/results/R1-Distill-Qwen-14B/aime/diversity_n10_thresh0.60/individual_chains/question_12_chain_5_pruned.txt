Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the number of ways to fill a 2x3 grid with digits such that two conditions are satisfied. The grid looks like this:

\[
\begin{array}{|c|c|c|} \hline a & b & c \\ \hline d & e & f \\ \hline \end{array}
\]

The first condition is that when I read the grid left to right, I get two numbers, which I think are "abc" and "def". The sum of these two numbers should be 999. The second condition is that when I read the grid top to bottom, I get three numbers, "ad", "be", and "cf". The sum of these three numbers should be 99. 

Wait, let me make sure I understand correctly. So, reading left to right, the first row is the three-digit number abc, and the second row is def. So, abc + def = 999. For the vertical reading, each column is a two-digit number: the first column is ad, the second is be, and the third is cf. So, ad + be + cf = 99. Got it.

The problem gives an example where the grid is filled with 0, 0, 8 in the first row and 9, 9, 1 in the second. Let me check if that works. So, abc is 008, which is 8, and def is 991. 8 + 991 = 999, which satisfies the first condition. For the vertical sum, ad is 09, which is 9; be is 09, which is 9; and cf is 81. Adding them up: 9 + 9 + 81 = 99, which matches the second condition. So the example works.

Now, I need to find all such possible grids. Let me think about how to model this.

First, let's denote the digits as follows:

First row: a b c
Second row: d e f

So, the first condition is:

100a + 10b + c + 100d + 10e + f = 999.

The second condition is:

10a + d + 10b + e + 10c + f = 99.

So, I have two equations:

1) 100a + 10b + c + 100d + 10e + f = 999.

2) 10a + d + 10b + e + 10c + f = 99.

Hmm. Let me write them again:

Equation 1: 100a + 10b + c + 100d + 10e + f = 999

Equation 2: 10a + d + 10b + e + 10c + f = 99

I can try to subtract equation 2 from equation 1 to see if that simplifies things. Let's compute equation 1 minus equation 2:

(100a -10a) + (10b -10b) + (c - 10c) + (100d - d) + (10e - e) + (f - f) = 999 - 99

Calculating each term:

90a + 0b -9c + 99d + 9e + 0f = 900

Simplify this equation:

90a -9c +99d +9e = 900.

I can factor out a 9:

9*(10a - c + 11d + e) = 900.

Divide both sides by 9:

10a - c + 11d + e = 100.

So, equation 3: 10a - c + 11d + e = 100.

That's a simpler equation. Now, I have equation 3 and equation 2. Maybe I can express some variables in terms of others.

Let me think about equation 2 again:

10a + d + 10b + e + 10c + f = 99.

Let me rearrange equation 2 to group similar terms:

(10a + 10c) + (d + e) + (10b + f) = 99.

Wait, I don't know if that helps. Alternatively, maybe I can express f from equation 2.

From equation 2: f = 99 - 10a - d -10b - e -10c.

Wait, but then equation 1 can be written as:

(100a + 10b + c) + (100d + 10e + f) = 999.

Let me denote the first three digits as N = 100a + 10b + c, and the next three as M = 100d + 10e + f. So, N + M = 999.

From equation 2, the vertical sum, which is (10a + d) + (10b + e) + (10c + f) = 99.

Let me denote each vertical two-digit number as:

P = 10a + d,

Q = 10b + e,

R = 10c + f.

So, P + Q + R = 99.

But we also have N + M = 999.

But N is 100a + 10b + c, which is equal to 10*(10a + b) + c. Hmm, maybe not directly helpful.

Wait, maybe think of N and M in terms of P, Q, R.

Let's see:

P = 10a + d => d = P -10a.

Similarly, Q = 10b + e => e = Q -10b.

R = 10c + f => f = R -10c.

Now, substitute these into equation 1:

N + M = (10
