Okay, so I have this tetrahedron ABCD with some specific edge lengths, and I need to find the distance from the incenter (the point inside the tetrahedron equidistant from all faces) to each face. The distance should be in the form m√n/p, and then I have to find m + n + p where m and p are coprime, and n is square-free.

First, let me note down the given edge lengths:

- AB = CD = √41
- AC = BD = √80
- BC = AD = √89

Hmm, interesting. So the opposite edges are equal. That seems symmetric in some way. Maybe the tetrahedron is isosceles? Or maybe it's a special kind of tetrahedron where opposite edges are equal. I remember that in such cases, the tetrahedron can sometimes be considered as two congruent triangles connected in a particular way.

Wait, so AB = CD, AC = BD, and BC = AD. That symmetry might mean that the tetrahedron is "equifacial" or something, but not necessarily regular. Alternatively, it might be a kind of dual tetrahedron where each pair of opposite edges are equal.

I think such a tetrahedron is called "isosceles" because all opposite edges are equal. So, perhaps this tetrahedron has some properties similar to a regular tetrahedron but isn't regular itself.

I need to find the inradius. The inradius of a tetrahedron is given by the formula:

r = 3V / S

Where V is the volume of the tetrahedron, and S is the total surface area (the sum of the areas of all four faces). So, I need to compute the volume V and the surface area S.

But first, let me see if I can compute the areas of the faces. Since all the opposite edges are equal, perhaps each face is congruent? Wait, not necessarily. Each face is a triangle, but with edges AB, AC, BC, etc. Let's see:

Wait, ABCD is a tetrahedron, so the four faces are triangles ABC, ABD, ACD, and BCD.

Given the edge lengths, each face might have edges like:

- Triangle ABC: AB = √41, BC = √89, AC = √80
- Triangle ABD: AB = √41, BD = √80, AD = √89
- Triangle ACD: AC = √80, CD = √41, AD = √89
- Triangle BCD: BC = √89, CD = √41, BD = √80

Wait, so each face has edges of lengths √41, √80, and √89. So all four faces are congruent triangles? Because each face is a triangle with sides √41, √80, and √89. So, each face is congruent, meaning all four faces have the same area. That's helpful because the total surface area S will be 4 times the area of one face.

So, if I can compute the area of one face, multiply by four, and that's S.

Let me compute the area of triangle ABC. Since the sides are a=√41, b=√80, c=√89.

I can use Heron's formula for the area of a triangle. Heron's formula is:

Area = √[s(s - a)(s - b)(s - c)]

Where s = (a + b + c)/2 is the semi-perimeter.

So, let me compute s:

s = (√41 + √80 + √89)/2

Hmm, but calculating this directly seems complicated because of the square roots. Maybe there's a better way since all the faces are congruent. Alternatively, perhaps the tetrahedron is regular in some coordinate system.

Wait, another approach: Maybe it's possible to place this tetrahedron in a coordinate system such that the coordinates of the vertices can be determined, and from there, compute the volume and surface areas.

Given the symmetry of the edge lengths, perhaps the tetrahedron can be embedded in 3D space with vertices at points that are symmetric in some way.

Let me think about how to assign coordinates to the vertices. Since opposite edges are equal, perhaps the tetrahedron is vertex-transitive or something, but I'm not sure.

Wait, if I can set the coordinates such that the midpoints are at the origin or something. Alternatively, maybe place points so that opposite edges are skew lines with equal lengths.

Alternatively, perhaps the tetrahedron is such that each pair of opposite edges are perpendicular? Because sometimes, in such symmetric tetrahedrons, the edges can be orthogonal.

Wait, if I can consider that the edges AB and CD are not only equal in length but also perpendicular, and similarly for the others, then we can model this as a kind of orthogonal tetrahedron.

Wait, if all pairs of opposite edges are perpendicular and equal in length, then perhaps the tetrahedron is a kind of "orthocentric" tetrahedron, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe I can model the tetrahedron with coordinates such that midpoints of opposite edges are at the origin, and the edges are along coordinate axes. Let me try that.

Let me denote the midpoints of AB and CD as M and N, respectively. Since AB = CD = √41, and if AB and CD are opposite edges, then perhaps the line connecting M and N is perpendicular to both AB and CD.

Wait, but perhaps choosing coordinate system such that M is at (0,0,0) and N is at some point along, say, the z-axis. Then, AB and CD would be placed symmetrically around the origin.

Alternatively, perhaps assign coordinates such that:

- Point A is at (x, y, z)
- Point B is at (-x, -y, -z)
- Point C is at (a, b, c)
- Point D is at (-a, -b, -c)

This way, the midpoints of AB and CD are at the origin. Then, the edge lengths can be computed using the distance formula.

So, let's try that.

Let me assign:

A = (x, y, z)
B = (-x, -y, -z)
C = (a, b, c)
D = (-a, -b, -c)

Then, the edge AB would have length sqrt[(2x)^2 + (2y)^2 + (2z)^2] = 2*sqrt(x^2 + y^2 + z^2). But AB = sqrt(41), so:

2*sqrt(x² + y² + z²) = sqrt(41)
=> sqrt(x² + y² + z²) = sqrt(41)/2
=> x² + y² + z² = 41/4

Similarly, the edge CD would have length sqrt[(2a)^2 + (2b)^2 + (2c)^2] = 2*sqrt(a² + b² + c²). And CD is sqrt(41), so:

2*sqrt(a² + b² + c²) = sqrt(41)
=> sqrt(a² + b² + c²) = sqrt(41)/2
=> a² + b² + c² = 41/4

So both A and C are at a distance of sqrt(41)/2 from the origin.

Now, let's compute the length AC. AC is the distance between A = (x,y,z) and C = (a,b,c).

So, AC² = (x - a)^2 + (y - b)^2 + (z - c)^2 = 80.

But AC is given as sqrt(80), so AC² = 80.

Similarly, BD is the distance between B = (-x,-y,-z) and D = (-a,-b,-c):

BD² = (-x + a)^2 + (-y + b)^2 + (-z + c)^2 = (a - x)^2 + (b - y)^2 + (c - z)^2 = 80. So, same as AC², which makes sense because AC = BD.

Similarly, let's compute BC. BC is the distance between B = (-x, -y, -z) and C = (a, b, c):

BC² = (a + x)^2 + (b + y)^2 + (c + z)^2 = 89

Similarly, AD is the distance between A = (x,y,z) and D = (-a,-b,-c):

AD² = (-a - x)^2 + (-b - y)^2 + (-c - z)^2 = (a + x)^2 + (b + y)^2 + (c + z)^2 = 89. So, same as BC².

So, BC² = AD² = 89.

So, we have:

AC² = (x - a)^2 + (y - b)^2 + (z - c)^2 = 80
BC² = (x + a)^2 + (y + b)^2 + (z + c)^2 = 89

Let me write out these equations.

First, expand AC²:

(x - a)^2 + (y - b)^2 + (z - c)^2 = 80
= (x² - 2ax + a²) + (y² - 2by + b²) + (z² - 2cz + c²)
= x² + y² + z² + a² + b² + c² - 2(ax + by + cz)
= 41/4 + 41/4 - 2(ax + by + cz)
= 41/2 - 2(ax + by + cz) = 80

Similarly, expand BC²:

(x + a)^2 + (y + b)^2 + (z + c)^2 = 89
= x² + 2ax + a² + y² + 2by + b² + z² + 2cz + c²
= x² + y² + z² + a² + b² + c² + 2(ax + by + cz)
= 41/4 + 41/4 + 2(ax + by + cz)
= 41/2 + 2(ax + by + cz) = 89

So now, I have two equations:

1) 41/2 - 2(ax + by + cz) = 80
2) 41/2 + 2(ax + by + cz) = 89

Let me write equation 1 as:

41/2 - 2(ax + by + cz) = 80
=> -2(ax + by + cz) = 80 - 41/2
Compute 80 as 160/2, so 160/2 - 41/2 = 119/2
So, -2(ax + by + cz) = 119/2
Divide both sides by -2:
ax + by + cz = -(119/2)/2 = -119/4

Similarly, equation 2:

41/2 + 2(ax + by + cz) = 89
=> 2(ax + by + cz) = 89 - 41/2
Compute 89 as 178/2, so 178/2 - 41/2 = 137/2
Divide both sides by 2:
ax + by + cz = 137/4

Wait, but equation 1 gives ax + by + cz = -119/4
Equation 2 gives ax + by + cz = 137/4

This is a contradiction because -119/4 ≠ 137/4. That can't be.

Hmm, so that suggests that my assumption about how I placed the points might be wrong. Maybe the coordinates can't be placed symmetrically like that.

Alternatively, maybe I need a different approach.

Wait, perhaps the tetrahedron is such that all edges are equal to their opposite edges, but not necessarily placed symmetrically as I tried before.

Alternatively, maybe I can use vectors to model the tetrahedron.

Let me assign vectors to the points, with I being the incenter.

In a tetrahedron, the inradius can also be calculated using the formula involving the volume and the areas of the faces.

But to compute the volume, maybe I can use the Cayley-Menger determinant. Since I have all the edge lengths, perhaps that's the way to go.

The Cayley-Menger determinant for a tetrahedron with edge lengths AB = a, AC = b, AD = c, BC = d, BD = e, CD = f is given by:

Volume² = (1/288) * determinant of the matrix:

0 1 1 1 1
1 0 a² b² c²
1 a² 0 d² e²
1 b² d² 0 f²
1 c² e² f² 0

So, I can plug in the given edge lengths into this determinant.

Given:

AB = sqrt(41) => a = sqrt(41)
AC = sqrt(80) => b = sqrt(80)
AD = sqrt(89) => c = sqrt(89)
BC = sqrt(89) => d = sqrt(89)
BD = sqrt(80) => e = sqrt(80)
CD = sqrt(41) => f = sqrt(41)

So, let me write down the matrix:

Row 0: 0, 1, 1, 1, 1

Row 1: 1, 0, 41, 80, 89

Row 2: 1, 41, 0, 89, 80

Row 3: 1, 80, 89, 0, 41

Row 4: 1, 89, 80, 41, 0

Wait, let me confirm:

The matrix is 5x5. The first row is [0,1,1,1,1]. Then the next four rows are:

[1, 0, AB², AC², AD²]

[1, AB², 0, BC², BD²]

[1, AC², BC², 0, CD²]

[1, AD², BD², CD², 0]

Wait, so in the second row, the elements are 1, 0, AB², AC², AD².

Third row: 1, AB², 0, BC², BD².

Fourth row: 1, AC², BC², 0, CD².

Fifth row: 1, AD², BD², CD², 0.

So, plugging in the values:

AB² = 41, AC² = 80, AD² = 89,

BC² = 89, BD² = 80, CD² = 41.

So, the matrix is:

Row 0: 0, 1, 1, 1, 1

Row 1: 1, 0, 41, 80, 89

Row 2: 1, 41, 0, 89, 80

Row 3: 1, 80, 89, 0, 41

Row 4: 1, 89, 80, 41, 0

Now, I need to compute the determinant of this matrix. Then, Volume squared is (1/288) times the determinant.

Calculating a 5x5 determinant is going to be tedious. Maybe there's some symmetry or pattern that can help simplify it.

Looking at the matrix, I notice that it's symmetric except for the first row and column.

Wait, the matrix is symmetric because:

- The (1,2) entry is 41, and the (2,1) is also 41.

Similarly, (1,3)=80 and (3,1)=80.

(1,4)=89 and (4,1)=89.

So, the matrix is symmetric. That might help in computing the determinant.

But computing the determinant of a 5x5 matrix is still a lot. Maybe I can perform row or column operations to simplify it.

Alternatively, perhaps I can note that the determinant has a particular form due to the symmetry.

Wait, another thought: Since all the faces are congruent triangles, maybe the tetrahedron is isohedral, meaning that all its faces are congruent, and it's face-transitive. But I'm not sure if that's the case here.

Alternatively, maybe the tetrahedron can be embedded in a coordinate system in such a way that the coordinates are (a, b, c), (-a, -b, -c), etc., but earlier that led to a contradiction, so maybe I need a different approach.

Alternatively, maybe I can calculate the volume using another method.

Wait, maybe I can compute the volume by splitting the tetrahedron into two parts, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps I can compute the volume using the formula for a tetrahedron with congruent opposite edges.

I remember that if a tetrahedron has opposite edges equal, it can be considered as a disphenoid. A disphenoid is a tetrahedron where opposite edges are equal, and it's known that in a disphenoid, the volume can be calculated using a specific formula.

Yes, I think in a disphenoid, the volume can be calculated as:

V = (4/3) * sqrt( (a² + b² - c²)(a² + c² - b²)(b² + c² - a²) ) / 8

Wait, no, that doesn't seem quite right. Let me think.

I found a formula online before, but I don't remember exactly. Alternatively, perhaps for a disphenoid, the volume can be calculated using the edges and some other parameters.

Wait, another approach: Maybe the volume can be found using the formula involving the product of the lengths of the edges and some angles between them, but that seems complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use the Cayley-Menger determinant as I initially thought, but proceed step by step.

Let me try to compute the determinant.

The matrix is:

Row 0: 0, 1, 1, 1, 1

Row 1: 1, 0, 41, 80, 89

Row 2: 1, 41, 0, 89, 80

Row 3: 1, 80, 89, 0, 41

Row 4: 1, 89, 80, 41, 0

Let me denote the matrix as CM.

I need to compute det(CM). Since the first row has a zero followed by ones, perhaps I can expand the determinant along the first row.

The determinant can be expanded as:

0 * det(minor) - 1 * det(minor) + 1 * det(minor) - 1 * det(minor) + 1 * det(minor)

But since the first element is zero, that term drops out.

So, det(CM) = -1 * det(M1) + 1 * det(M2) - 1 * det(M3) + 1 * det(M4), where M1, M2, M3, M4 are the minors corresponding to the elements in the first row (excluding the zero).

Wait, more precisely, the cofactor expansion along the first row:

det(CM) = 0*C00 - 1*C01 + 1*C02 - 1*C03 + 1*C04

Where C0j are the cofactors, which are (-1)^(0+j) times the determinant of the minor matrix obtained by removing row 0 and column j.

So, det(CM) = -1 * det(M1) + 1 * det(M2) - 1 * det(M3) + 1 * det(M4)

Where M1 is the minor for column 1 (excluding row 0 and column 1):

M1 is:

Row 1: 1, 0, 80, 89

Row 2: 1, 41, 0, 89

Row 3: 1, 80, 89, 0

Row 4: 1, 89, 80, 41

Similarly, M2 is the minor for column 2:

M2 is:

Row 1: 1, 41, 80, 89

Row 2: 1, 0, 0, 89

Row 3: 1, 41, 89, 0

Row 4: 1, 80, 80, 41

Wait, no, actually, each minor is obtained by removing row 0 and the respective column.

So for M1 (column 1), columns 0,2,3,4 remain.

Similarly, for M2 (column 2), columns 0,1,3,4 remain.

Wait, perhaps it's better to write each minor explicitly.

Wait, perhaps this is getting too complicated, but maybe I can compute some of these minors.

Alternatively, perhaps I can note that the matrix is symmetric, so the determinant might have some properties.

Alternatively, maybe I can perform row operations to simplify the determinant.

Let me try subtracting row 1 from rows 2, 3, 4.

So, in the original matrix:

Row 0: 0, 1, 1, 1, 1

Row 1: 1, 0, 41, 80, 89

Row 2: 1, 41, 0, 89, 80

Row 3: 1, 80, 89, 0, 41

Row 4: 1, 89, 80, 41, 0

Subtract row 1 from row 2: Row2_new = Row2 - Row1

Row2_new: 1-1=0, 41-0=41, 0-41=-41, 89-80=9, 80-89=-9

Similarly, subtract row 1 from row3: Row3_new = Row3 - Row1

Row3_new: 1-1=0, 80-0=80, 89-41=48, 0-80=-80, 41-89=-48

Subtract row1 from row4: Row4_new = Row4 - Row1

Row4_new: 1-1=0, 89-0=89, 80-41=39, 41-80=-39, 0-89=-89

So now, the matrix becomes:

Row0: 0, 1, 1, 1, 1

Row1: 1, 0, 41, 80, 89

Row2: 0, 41, -41, 9, -9

Row3: 0, 80, 48, -80, -48

Row4: 0, 89, 39, -39, -89

Now, the determinant remains the same after these row operations.

Now, let's expand the determinant along column 0. The first column is [0,1,0,0,0]. So, only the element at (1,0) is 1, others are 0.

Therefore, the determinant is:

1 * (-1)^(1+0) * det(minor) where minor is the matrix obtained by removing row1 and column0.

So, minor is the 4x4 matrix:

Row0: 1, 1, 1, 1

Row2: 41, -41, 9, -9

Row3: 80, 48, -80, -48

Row4: 89, 39, -39, -89

Wait, let me write that down:

Row0: 1, 1, 1, 1

Row2: 41, -41, 9, -9

Row3: 80, 48, -80, -48

Row4: 89, 39, -39, -89

So, the determinant is (-1)^1 * det(minor) = -det(minor)

So, det(CM) = -det(minor)

Now, I need to compute the determinant of this 4x4 matrix. Let me denote this matrix as M.

M:

Row0: 1, 1, 1, 1

Row1: 41, -41, 9, -9

Row2: 80, 48, -80, -48

Row3: 89, 39, -39, -89

Hmm, computing a 4x4 determinant is still a bit involved. Maybe I can perform row operations to simplify it.

Let me try to subtract row0 from rows1,2,3.

Row1_new = Row1 - Row0: 41-1=40, -41-1=-42, 9-1=8, -9-1=-10

Row2_new = Row2 - Row0: 80-1=79, 48-1=47, -80-1=-81, -48-1=-49

Row3_new = Row3 - Row0: 89-1=88, 39-1=38, -39-1=-40, -89-1=-90

So, the matrix becomes:

Row0: 1, 1, 1, 1

Row1: 40, -42, 8, -10

Row2: 79, 47, -81, -49

Row3: 88, 38, -40, -90

Now, the determinant remains the same (since we're doing row operations). Now, I can compute the determinant using expansion along the first row or perform more row operations.

Alternatively, perhaps factor out common terms from each row.

Looking at row1: 40, -42, 8, -10. Maybe factor out a 2: 2*(20, -21, 4, -5)

Similarly, row2: 79,47,-81,-49. Doesn't seem to have common factors.

Row3: 88,38,-40,-90. Maybe factor out 2: 2*(44,19,-20,-45)

Hmm, but factoring out 2 from row1 and row3 would bring a factor of 2^2 =4 out of the determinant.

Wait, but maybe it's better to proceed with expansion.

Alternatively, let's subtract row1 from row2 and row3.

Row2_new = Row2 - Row1: 79-40=39, 47-(-42)=89, -81-8=-89, -49-(-10)=-39

Row3_new = Row3 - Row1: 88-40=48, 38-(-42)=80, -40-8=-48, -90-(-10)=-80

So, the matrix becomes:

Row0: 1, 1, 1, 1

Row1: 40, -42, 8, -10

Row2: 39, 89, -89, -39

Row3: 48, 80, -48, -80

Now, let's compute the determinant of this matrix. Hmm, perhaps I can perform another row operation.

Let me subtract row1 from row2 and row3 again, but wait, row2 and row3 are already modified.

Alternatively, perhaps factor out some terms.

Looking at row2: 39,89,-89,-39.

I notice that the second and third elements are negatives: 89 and -89. Similarly, the first and last elements are 39 and -39.

So, row2: 39, 89, -89, -39 = [39, 89, -89, -39]

Similarly, row3: 48, 80, -48, -80.

Here, the first and third elements are 48 and -48, and the second and fourth are 80 and -80.

So, row3: 48, 80, -48, -80 = [48,80,-48,-80]

So, rows 2 and 3 have a kind of symmetry. Maybe I can factor this.

For row2: factor out 13 from the first and last elements (since 39=13*3, -39=13*(-3)), and 89 is prime.

Wait, maybe not helpful. Alternatively, perhaps factor out -1 from the last two elements.

Alternatively, maybe I can perform column operations to create zeros.

Looking at the matrix:

Row0: 1, 1, 1, 1

Row1: 40, -42, 8, -10

Row2: 39, 89, -89, -39

Row3: 48, 80, -48, -80

Let me try to eliminate elements in column 0 below row0.

Since row0 has 1 in column0, I can subtract 40*row0 from row1, 39*row0 from row2, and 48*row0 from row3.

But wait, computing:

Row1_new = Row1 - 40*Row0

Row2_new = Row2 - 39*Row0

Row3_new = Row3 - 48*Row0

But since Row0 is [1,1,1,1], this would subtract 40,40,40,40 from Row1, etc.

Wait, let's compute:

Row1_new = [40 -40*1, -42 -40*1, 8 -40*1, -10 -40*1] = [0, -82, -32, -50]

Row2_new = [39 -39*1, 89 -39*1, -89 -39*1, -39 -39*1] = [0, 50, -128, -78]

Row3_new = [48 -48*1, 80 -48*1, -48 -48*1, -80 -48*1] = [0, 32, -96, -128]

So, the matrix now becomes:

Row0: 1, 1, 1, 1

Row1: 0, -82, -32, -50

Row2: 0, 50, -128, -78

Row3: 0, 32, -96, -128

Now, the determinant remains the same, except for the row operations, which don't change the determinant.

Now, since all rows below row0 have 0 in column0, we can expand the determinant along column0.

The determinant is 1 * det(minor), where minor is the 3x3 matrix:

Row1: -82, -32, -50

Row2: 50, -128, -78

Row3: 32, -96, -128

So, now, compute the determinant of this 3x3 matrix.

Let me denote the minor as:

| -82   -32    -50 |
|  50  -128    -78 |
|  32   -96   -128 |

Compute its determinant:

= -82 * [(-128)(-128) - (-78)(-96)] - (-32) * [50*(-128) - (-78)*32] + (-50) * [50*(-96) - (-128)*32]

Let me compute each part step by step.

First term: -82 * [ (128*128) - (78*96) ]

Wait, but actually,

Wait, the determinant is:

a(ei − fh) − b(di − fg) + c(dh − eg)

Where the matrix is:

[a b c]

[d e f]

[g h i]

So, for our matrix:

a = -82, b = -32, c = -50

d = 50, e = -128, f = -78

g = 32, h = -96, i = -128

Compute:

a*(e*i - f*h) - b*(d*i - f*g) + c*(d*h - e*g)

Compute each component:

First component: a*(e*i - f*h) = (-82)*[ (-128)*(-128) - (-78)*(-96) ]

Compute inside the brackets:

(-128)*(-128) = 16384

(-78)*(-96) = 7488

So, 16384 - 7488 = 8896

So, first component: (-82)*8896 = -82 * 8896

Second component: -b*(d*i - f*g) = -(-32)*[50*(-128) - (-78)*32]

Compute inside the brackets:

50*(-128) = -6400

(-78)*32 = -2496

So, d*i - f*g = -6400 - (-2496) = -6400 + 2496 = -3904

Multiply by -b: 32*(-3904) = 32*(-3904)

Wait, no: -b is 32, so 32*(-3904) = -124,928

Wait, let me compute each step:

Inside the second term:

d*i = 50*(-128) = -6400

f*g = (-78)*32 = -2496

So, d*i - f*g = (-6400) - (-2496) = (-6400) + 2496 = -3904

Then, -b*(d*i - f*g) = 32*(-3904) = -124,928

Third component: c*(d*h - e*g) = (-50)*[50*(-96) - (-128)*32]

Compute inside the brackets:

50*(-96) = -4800

(-128)*32 = -4096

So, d*h - e*g = (-4800) - (-4096) = (-4800) +4096 = -704

Multiply by c: (-50)*(-704) = 35,200

Now, sum all three components:

First: (-82)*8896 = let's compute 82 * 8896:

Compute 80*8896 = 711,680

Compute 2*8896 = 17,792

Total: 711,680 +17,792 = 729,472

So, (-82)*8896 = -729,472

Second component: -124,928

Third component: +35,200

So, total determinant = (-729,472) + (-124,928) + 35,200

Compute step by step:

-729,472 -124,928 = -854,400

-854,400 +35,200 = -819,200

So, the determinant of the minor is -819,200

Therefore, the determinant of matrix M is equal to the determinant of the minor, which is -819,200. But wait, earlier I had det(CM) = -det(M). So, det(CM) = -(-819,200) = 819,200.

But wait, no, let me retrace:

Wait, the determinant of the minor (3x3) was -819,200.

But the determinant of the 4x4 matrix (denoted as M) is equal to 1 * det(minor) as we expanded along column0.

Wait, no, no. Wait, when we did the row operations, we transformed the original 5x5 matrix into a form where the determinant was equal to the determinant of the 4x4 minor.

Wait, let's recap:

We started with the 5x5 Cayley-Menger determinant.

Through row operations, we transformed it into a matrix where the first row was [0,1,1,1,1], and the other rows had zeros in the first column except for the first row.

We then expanded along the first column, which gave us det(CM) = -det(minor), where minor is the 4x4 matrix.

We then transformed that 4x4 matrix through more row operations, and eventually found that the determinant of the minor (the 4x4) was -819,200.

Wait, no, let me see:

Wait, the minor after expansion was a 4x4 matrix, which we transformed into another matrix via row operations, and then expanded into a 3x3 determinant, which gave us -819,200.

Therefore, the determinant of the 4x4 minor is equal to -819,200.

Therefore, det(CM) = -det(minor) = -(-819,200) = 819,200.

Wait, no: The 5x5 determinant was transformed into a matrix where det(CM) = -det(4x4 minor). The 4x4 minor's determinant was found to be -819,200. So, det(CM) = -(-819,200) = 819,200.

Wait, no: Let me clarify.

We had:

det(CM) = -det(4x4 minor)

Then, the 4x4 minor was transformed into a matrix via row operations, and when we computed its determinant, we found it to be -819,200.

So, det(4x4 minor) = -819,200.

Therefore, det(CM) = -det(4x4 minor) = -(-819,200) = 819,200.

Yes, that's correct.

So, now, Volume squared is (1/288) * det(CM) = (1/288) * 819,200.

Compute that: 819,200 / 288.

Simplify:

Divide numerator and denominator by 16: 819,200 ÷16=51,200; 288 ÷16=18

So, 51,200 / 18

Simplify further: divide numerator and denominator by 2: 25,600 /9

So, Volume squared is 25,600 /9

Therefore, Volume is sqrt(25,600 /9) = sqrt(25,600)/sqrt(9) = 160 /3

So, the volume V is 160/3.

Great, so Volume V = 160/3.

Now, I need to compute the total surface area S. Since each face has the same area, as all faces are congruent triangles.

So, compute the area of one face, then multiply by 4.

Each face is a triangle with sides √41, √80, √89.

Compute the area using Heron's formula.

Compute semi-perimeter s:

s = (√41 + √80 + √89)/2

But computing this directly is messy because of the square roots. Maybe I can compute s² or something else.

Alternatively, perhaps I can compute the area using vectors or coordinates.

Wait, another idea: since all edges are known, perhaps I can compute the area using the formula:

Area = (1/4) * sqrt( (a + b + c)(-a + b + c)(a - b + c)(a + b - c) )

Which is another form of Heron's formula.

Let me compute this.

Given a = √41, b=√80, c=√89.

Compute:

(a + b + c) = √41 + √80 + √89

(-a + b + c) = -√41 + √80 + √89

(a - b + c) = √41 - √80 + √89

(a + b - c) = √41 + √80 - √89

Multiply all four together:

(√41 + √80 + √89)(-√41 + √80 + √89)(√41 - √80 + √89)(√41 + √80 - √89)

This looks complicated, but perhaps we can pair the terms:

Let me pair the first and fourth terms:

(√41 + √80 + √89)(√41 + √80 - √89) = [ (√41 + √80)^2 - (√89)^2 ]

Similarly, pair the second and third terms:

(-√41 + √80 + √89)(√41 - √80 + √89) = [ (√89)^2 - (√41 - √80)^2 ]

Compute each pair:

First pair:

(√41 + √80)^2 - (√89)^2

= (41 + 2√(41*80) + 80) - 89

= (121 + 2√3280) -89

= 32 + 2√3280

Second pair:

(√89)^2 - (√41 - √80)^2

= 89 - [41 - 2√(41*80) + 80]

= 89 - [121 - 2√3280]

= 89 -121 + 2√3280

= -32 + 2√3280

Now, multiply the two results:

(32 + 2√3280)(-32 + 2√3280) = (2√3280)^2 - (32)^2

= 4*3280 - 1024

= 13120 - 1024 = 12096

So, the product is 12096.

Therefore, Area^2 = (1/16)*12096 = 756

Hence, Area = sqrt(756) = sqrt(4*189) = 2*sqrt(189)

But 189 = 9*21 = 9*3*7, so sqrt(189) = 3*sqrt(21)

Thus, Area = 2*3*sqrt(21) = 6√21

So, the area of one face is 6√21. Since there are four faces, total surface area S = 4*6√21 = 24√21.

Now, the inradius r = 3V / S

Plugging in the values:

r = 3*(160/3) / (24√21) = (160) / (24√21) = (20/3√21)

Rationalize the denominator:

Multiply numerator and denominator by √21:

r = (20√21) / (3*21) = (20√21)/63

Simplify, 20 and 63 are coprime, 21 is square-free.

So, r = (20√21)/63

Thus, m=20, n=21, p=63.

But wait, 63 and 20: are they coprime? 63 factors into 7*3^2, 20 is 2^2*5. So yes, they are coprime.

And n=21, which is 3*7, square-free.

So, m + n + p = 20 + 21 + 63 = 104.

Wait, wait, but 20 + 21 is 41, plus 63 is 104.

But hold on, let me double-check the calculation for the area.

Wait, when I calculated the product of the four terms, I got 12096. Then, Area^2 = (1/16)*12096 = 756, so Area is sqrt(756). Let me compute sqrt(756):

756 = 4 * 189 = 4 * 9 *21 = 4*9*3*7. So sqrt(756) = 2*3*sqrt(21) = 6√21. So that's correct.

So, the area is 6√21, four faces give 24√21.

Volume is 160/3.

So, r = 3*(160/3) / (24√21) = 160 / (24√21) = (20 / 3√21) = (20√21)/63.

Yes, correct.

So, m=20, n=21, p=63.

Sum is 20 +21 +63 = 104.

Wait, but wait: 20 and 63 are coprime? 20 is 2^2 *5, 63 is 7*3^2. No common factors, yes.

n=21 is square-free, yes.

So, the answer is 104.


To solve the problem, we first recognize that the tetrahedron has opposite edges equal, suggesting it is a disphenoid. We use the Cayley-Menger determinant to find the volume \( V \) and Heron's formula to find the total surface area \( S \).

1. **Cayley-Menger Determinant**:
   The determinant for the given edge lengths yields:
   \[
   \text{det}(CM) = 819,200
   \]
   The volume \( V \) is calculated as:
   \[
   V = \frac{1}{288} \sqrt{\text{det}(CM)} = \frac{160}{3}
   \]

2. **Surface Area Calculation**:
   Each face is a triangle with sides \( \sqrt{41} \), \( \sqrt{80} \), and \( \sqrt{89} \). Using Heron's formula, the area of one face is:
   \[
   \text{Area} = 6\sqrt{21}
   \]
   The total surface area \( S \) is:
   \[
   S = 4 \times 6\sqrt{21} = 24\sqrt{21}
   \]

3. **Inradius Calculation**:
   The inradius \( r \) is given by:
   \[
   r = \frac{3V}{S} = \frac{3 \times \frac{160}{3}}{24\sqrt{21}} = \frac{20\sqrt{21}}{63}
   \]

4. **Final Result**:
   The distance is in the form \( \frac{20\sqrt{21}}{63} \), where \( m = 20 \), \( n = 21 \), and \( p = 63 \). Thus, \( m + n + p = 20 + 21 + 63 = 104 \).

\boxed{104}
