Okay, so I have this geometry problem here about triangle ABC. The problem says that the circumcenter is O and the incenter is I. It also mentions that IA is perpendicular to OI. The circumradius is 13, and the inradius is 6. I need to find AB multiplied by AC. Hmm, that sounds a bit challenging, but let me try to break it down.

First, let me recall some concepts. The circumradius (R) of a triangle is the radius of the circumscribed circle, and the inradius (r) is the radius of the inscribed circle. The incenter (I) is where the angle bisectors meet, and the circumcenter (O) is where the perpendicular bisectors meet.

The problem states that IA is perpendicular to OI. That seems important. So, the line from the incenter I to vertex A is perpendicular to the line segment OI. Hmm, maybe I can use some coordinate geometry here? Or perhaps some properties of triangle centers?

I remember that in a triangle, the distance between the incenter and circumcenter can be found using the formula: OI² = R(R - 2r). Let me check that. Yes, that's the formula. So, with R = 13 and r = 6, OI² = 13*(13 - 12) = 13*1 = 13. So, OI = sqrt(13). Wait, that's a useful piece of information.

Now, since IA is perpendicular to OI, maybe I can use the Pythagorean theorem somewhere. Let me try to visualize this. If IA is perpendicular to OI, then triangle IAO is a right-angled triangle at A. Wait, no, it's right-angled at I? Wait, IA is perpendicular to OI, so the right angle is at I? Or is it at A? Let me think. If IA is perpendicular to OI, then the two lines IA and OI intersect at I and form a right angle. So, the right angle is at I. So, triangle IAO is right-angled at I.

So, in triangle IAO, we have a right triangle with legs AI and IO, and hypotenuse AO. Wait, AO is the distance from A to O, which is the circumradius. Wait, no, AO is the distance from A to O. Wait, O is the circumcenter, so the distance from A to
