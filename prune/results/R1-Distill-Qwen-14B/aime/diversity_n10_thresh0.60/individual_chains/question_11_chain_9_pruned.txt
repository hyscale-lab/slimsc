Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the largest possible real part of the expression (75 + 117i)z + (96 + 144i)/z, where z is a complex number with |z| = 4. Hmm, okay. Let me break this down step by step.

First, I know that z is a complex number, and its magnitude is 4. That means z can be written in the form z = 4e^{iθ}, where θ is the argument of z. Or, alternatively, z = a + bi where a² + b² = 16. But maybe using the exponential form will be more convenient here because it might make the multiplication and division easier.

So, the expression is (75 + 117i)z + (96 + 144i)/z. Let me denote this expression as E for simplicity. So, E = (75 + 117i)z + (96 + 144i)/z.

Since |z| = 4, then 1/z is equal to the conjugate of z divided by |z|². Because 1/z = conjugate(z)/|z|². So, 1/z = (a - bi)/16 if z = a + bi. Alternatively, in exponential form, 1/z = (1/4)e^{-iθ} since |z| is 4, so 1/|z| is 1/4, and the argument becomes -θ.

So, let me rewrite E using this. Let me express both terms in exponential form.

First, (75 + 117i)z. Let's write 75 + 117i in polar form. Let me compute the magnitude and the angle.

The magnitude of 75 + 117i is sqrt(75² + 117²). Let's compute that. 75 squared is 5625, and 117 squared is 13689. Adding them gives 5625 + 13689 = 19314. Hmm, sqrt(19314). Let me see if that simplifies. Hmm, 19314 divided by 9 is 21
