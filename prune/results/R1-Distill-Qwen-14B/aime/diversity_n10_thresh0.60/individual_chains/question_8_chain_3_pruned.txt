Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the number of triples of nonnegative integers (a, b, c) that satisfy two conditions: a + b + c = 300 and a²b + a²c + b²a + b²c + c²a + c²b = 6,000,000. Hmm, seems a bit tricky, but let's break it down.

First, I know that the equation a + b + c = 300 is a linear equation, and the other equation is quadratic but in a more complicated form. Maybe I can find a way to relate these two equations.

Looking at the second equation: a²b + a²c + b²a + b²c + c²a + c²b. I notice that each term is a product of two variables, one squared and the other not. Maybe I can factor this expression somehow.

Wait, let's see: a²b + a²c = a²(b + c). Similarly, b²a + b²c = b²(a + c), and c²a + c²b = c²(a + b). So the entire expression becomes a²(b + c) + b²(a + c) + c²(a + b). 

But from the first equation, a + b + c = 300, so b + c = 300 - a, a + c = 300 - b, and a + b = 300 - c. So substituting these into the expression, we get:

a²(300 - a) + b²(300 - b) + c²(300 - c) = 6,000,000.

Let me write that down:

a²(300 - a) + b²(300 - b) + c²(300 - c) = 6,000,000.

Hmm, maybe I can represent each term as 300a² - a³, so the entire equation becomes:

300a² - a³ + 300b² - b³ + 300c² - c³ = 6,000,000.

So, that simplifies to:

300(a² + b² + c²) - (a³ + b³ + c³) = 6,000,000.

Now, I can think of this as:

300(a² + b² + c²) - (a³ + b³ + c³) = 6,000,000.

I wonder if there's a way to relate a² + b² + c² and a³ + b³ + c³ using the first equation. Let's recall that a + b + c = 300. Maybe I can use some identities or inequalities here.

Wait, another thought: perhaps I can express a³ + b³ + c³ in terms of a + b + c and other symmetric sums. I remember that:

a³ + b³ + c³ = (a + b + c)³ - 3(a + b + c)(ab + bc + ca) + 3abc.

So substituting a + b + c = 300, this becomes:

a³ + b³ + c³ = 300³ - 3*300*(ab + bc + ca) + 3abc.

Let me compute 300³ first. 300³ is 27,000,000. So,

a³ + b³ + c³ = 27,000,000 - 900(ab + bc + ca) + 3abc.

Now, back to the equation I had earlier:

300(a² +
