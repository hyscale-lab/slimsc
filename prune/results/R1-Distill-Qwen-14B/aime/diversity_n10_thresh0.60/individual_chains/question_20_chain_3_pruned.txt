Okay, so I've got this math problem here, and I'm going to try to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again to make sure I understand.

There are 25 white chips and 25 black chips, all indistinguishable. We need to place some of these chips in a 5x5 grid. Each cell can hold at most one chip. The conditions are:

1. All chips in the same row must be the same color.
2. All chips in the same column must be the same color.
3. Additionally, any extra chip we try to place would violate one or more of the previous two conditions.

We need to find the number of ways to do this.

Hmm, okay. So, each row and each column must be all one color or the other. But not necessarily the same color across different rows or columns. Also, we can't add any more chips without breaking the rules, which probably means that the placement is maximal—i.e., every cell is either filled or, if it's empty, placing a chip there would violate the row or column color condition.

Wait, but the problem says "some of these chips"—so we don't have to fill the entire grid. But the additional condition about not being able to place any more chips suggests that the grid is as filled as possible without violating the color constraints.

Let me think about what that means. If a row has some white chips, then all the cells in that row must be white to satisfy the condition, but wait, no—because they can have "some" chips, but the condition is that all chips in the same row must be the same color. So, a row can have any number of chips, but all of them must be the same color. Similarly for columns.

Wait, but if a row has, say, 3 white chips, then the other two cells in that row must be empty because you can't have a different color. Similarly, for a column, if it has some black chips, the rest must be empty.

So, each row is either all white, all black, or empty. Similarly, each column is either all white, all black, or empty. But the twist is that the grid must be placed such that any additional chip would violate the row or column color conditions.

Wait, but if a row is empty, can we add a chip there? Hmm, but if we add a chip to an empty
