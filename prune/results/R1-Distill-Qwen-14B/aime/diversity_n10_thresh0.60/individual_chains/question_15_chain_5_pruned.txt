Okay, so I have this problem about counting the number of paths on an 8x8 grid. The paths start from the lower left corner and go to the upper right corner, covering a length of 16. The catch is that these paths must change direction exactly four times. Hmm, I need to figure out how to approach this.

First, let me visualize the grid. An 8x8 grid has 8 rows and 8 columns, making 64 squares. The lower left corner is (0,0) and the upper right corner is (8,8). A path from (0,0) to (8,8) would consist of moving right and up steps. Since it's an 8x8 grid, you need 8 right moves and 8 up moves, totaling 16 moves, which matches the problem statement.

Now, the problem is about the paths changing direction exactly four times. Each time the path changes direction, it switches from moving right to up or from up to right. So, if we start moving right, the first direction change will be to up, then to right again, and so on.

Wait, so how does the number of direction changes relate to the number of runs in each direction? A run is a consecutive sequence of steps in the same direction. Each time the direction changes, a new run begins. So, if a path changes direction exactly four times, that means there are five runs in total. Because the first direction is a run, then each change adds another run. So four changes lead to five runs.

So, the path alternates between right and up runs, starting with either right or up. So, there are two possibilities for the starting direction: right or up. Depending on that, the number of runs in each direction will vary.

Let me consider the two cases:

1. The path starts by moving right, then up, then right, and so on.
2. The path starts by moving up, then right, then up, and so on.

In each case, the number of runs in each direction will be different. Since the total number of runs is five, let me see:

Case 1: Starting with right.
Number of runs: 5.
So, for right, since we start with right, the number of right runs would be either 3 or 2, depending on whether 5 is odd or even. Wait, 5 is odd, so if we start with right, we'll have three right runs and two up runs. Because starting with right, the runs alternate, so right, up, right, up, right. That's three right runs and two up runs.

Similarly, Case 2: Starting with up.
Number of runs: 5.
So, starting with up, the runs would be up, right, up, right, up. That's three up runs and two right runs.

Wait, no, that's not correct. Wait, if you have five runs, starting with right, the number of right runs is (5+1)/2 = 3, and up runs is 2. Similarly, starting with up, the number of up runs is 3, and right runs is 2.

So, in either case, the path will consist of either three right runs and two up runs or three up runs and two right runs.

But wait, the total number of right moves is 8, and the total number of
