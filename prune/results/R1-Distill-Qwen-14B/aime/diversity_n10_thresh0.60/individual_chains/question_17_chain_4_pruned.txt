Okay, so I have this problem about rectangular boxes with a given surface area and volume, and I need to find the radius of the smallest sphere that can contain any of these boxes. Then, express r squared as a fraction p/q and find p+q. Hmm, let's break this down step by step.

First, I know that for a rectangular box, the surface area (SA) is given by 2(lw + lh + wh), where l, w, h are the length, width, and height. The volume (V) is lwh. The sphere that can contain the box must have a diameter equal to the space diagonal of the box, right? Because the sphere has to enclose the box entirely, so the diagonal would be the maximum distance between any two corners of the box, which should be the diameter of the sphere.

So, the space diagonal (d) of the box can be calculated using the formula d = sqrt(l² + w² + h²). Therefore, the radius r of the sphere would be half of that, so r = d/2 = sqrt(l² + w² + h²)/2. Thus, r² would be (l² + w² + h²)/4.

But wait, the problem states that the surface area is 54 and the volume is 23. So, we have two equations:

1. 2(lw + lh + wh) = 54
2. lwh = 23

We need to find l² + w² + h² in terms of these.

I remember that (l + w + h)² = l² + w² + h² + 2(lw + lh + wh). So, if I can find (l + w + h), then I can find l² + w² + h² by subtracting 2(lw + lh + wh), which is known from the surface area.

From equation 1: 2(lw + lh + wh) =54, so lw + lh + wh = 27.

So, (l + w + h)² = l² + w² + h² + 2*27 => (l + w + h)² = l² + w² + h² +54.

But I need l² + w² + h², which is (l + w + h)² -54. Hmm, but I don't know l + w + h.

Alternatively, maybe we can express l² + w² + h² in terms of the given surface area and volume.

Wait, I also remember that for three variables, there's a relation involving symmetric sums. Let me think: there's the formula for the sum of squares, which we have, and also maybe using the volume.

But perhaps I can use Lagrange multipliers here. Since we need to minimize the sphere's radius, which is equivalent to minimizing l² + w² + h², given the constraints on surface area and volume.

So, we need to minimize f(l, w, h) = l² + w² + h²

Subject to the constraints:

g(l, w, h) = 2(lw + lh + wh) =54

h(l, w, h) = lwh =23

Hmm, this seems like a problem with two constraints, so I can use the method of Lagrange multipliers with two constraints. That means we'll have to set up the gradients.

The Lagrangian function would be:

L = l² + w² + h² - λ(2(lw + lh + wh) -54) - μ(lwh -23)

Then, we take partial derivatives with respect to l, w, h, λ, μ and set them to zero.

So, partial derivatives:

∂L/∂l = 2l - λ(2(w + h)) - μ(wh) =0

Similarly,

∂L/∂w = 2w - λ(2(l + h)) - μ(lh) =0

∂L/∂h = 2h - λ(2(l + w)) - μ(lw) =0

And the constraints:

2(lw + lh + wh)=54

lwh=23

So, now we have a system of equations:

1. 2l - 2λ(w + h) - μ wh =0

2. 2w - 2λ(l + h) - μ lh =0

3. 2h - 2λ(l + w) - μ lw =0

4. 2(lw + lh + wh)=54

5. lwh=23

Hmm, this looks a bit complicated. Maybe we can find a symmetric solution where l = w = h, but wait, that would make it a cube. Let's check if that's possible.

If l = w = h = k, then surface area would be 2(3k²) = 6k² =54 => k²=9 => k=3. So volume would be k³=27, but the volume given is 23, which is less than 27. So a cube isn't possible here. So the minimal sphere probably doesn't correspond to a cube.

Therefore, the variables l, w, h are not all equal. But maybe two of them are equal, like l = w ≠ h, which might simplify the problem.

Let me try assuming l = w. So let l = w = a, and h = b.

Then, the surface area becomes 2(a² + 2ab) =54 => a² + 2ab =27.

The volume becomes a² b =23.

We need to minimize l² + w² + h² = 2a² + b².

So, express everything in terms of a and b.

From the volume: b=23/(a²)

Substitute into surface area equation: a² + 2a*(23/(a²)) =27 => a² + (46/a) =27.

Multiply both sides by a: a³ +46=27a => a³ -27a +46=0.

Hmm, solving this cubic equation. Let me try to find rational roots. The possible roots are factors of 46 over 1, so ±1, ±2, ±23, ±46.

Test a=1: 1 -27 +46=20≠0

a=2:8 -54 +46=0. Yes, a=2 is a root.

So, factor the cubic as (a-2)(a² +2a -23)=0.

Set to zero: a=2, or a² +2a -23=0.

Solutions for the quadratic: a = [-2 ± sqrt(4 +92)]/2 = [-2 ± sqrt(96)]/2 = [-2 ± 4*sqrt(6)]/2 = -1 ± 2*sqrt(6).

Since a must be positive, we have a=2, a= -1 + 2*sqrt(6), or a= -1 -2*sqrt(6) (which is negative, discard).

So, a=2 or a= -1 + 2√6.

Now, let's check a=2:

Then, b=23/(2²)=23/4=5.75.

So, the box dimensions are 2,2,5.75.

Compute the space diagonal squared: 2² +2² +5.75²=4 +4 +33.0625=41.0625. So, r²=41.0625/4=10.265625. Hmm, that's 10.265625, which is 164.25/16 or wait, 41.0625 is 41 + 0.0625=41 + 1/16= 657/16. So, 657/16 divided by 4 is 657/64.

Wait, 41.0625 is 41 + 1/16= (41*16 +1)/16= (656 +1)/16=657/16. Then, divide by 4: (657/16)/4=657/64. So, r²=657/64. Hmm, 657 and 64. Are they coprime? Let's see. 64 is 2^6. 657 is 657 divided by 3 is 219, 219/3=73. So, 657=3²×73. 64 is 2^6, no common
