Okay, so I've got this problem here about b-eautiful numbers. Let me try to wrap my head around it step by step. The problem says that a positive integer n is called b-eautiful if when you express it in base b, it has exactly two digits, and the sum of these two digits equals the square root of n. And the task is to find the smallest integer b (where b is at least 2) such that there are more than ten b-eautiful numbers.

Alright, let's break this down. First, I think I need to understand what it means for a number to have exactly two digits in base b. In any base b, a two-digit number would be something like "d1 d0" where d1 is the digit in the b's place and d0 is the digit in the units place. So, the value of this number in base 10 would be d1 * b + d0. Got that.

Next, the sum of these two digits, d1 + d0, has to equal the square root of n. So, n = (d1 + d0)^2. But we also have n expressed as d1*b + d0. So, putting those together: d1*b + d0 = (d1 + d0)^2.

Hmm, that gives us an equation to work with. Let me write that out:

d1 * b + d0 = (d1 + d0)^2.

I can rearrange this equation to solve for b. Let's see:

d1 * b = (d1 + d0)^2 - d0

So,

b = [(d1 + d0)^2 - d0] / d1

Simplify that a bit:

b = [(d1^2 + 2*d1*d0 + d0^2) - d0] / d1

Which simplifies to:

b = [d1^2 + 2*d1*d0 + d0^2 - d0] / d1

I can factor this:

b = d1 + 2*d0 + (d0^2 - d0)/d1

Hmm, that seems a bit complicated. Maybe there's a better way to approach this.

Wait, since d1 and d0 are digits in base b, they must satisfy certain conditions. Specifically, d1 must be at least 1 (since it's the leading digit of a two-digit number) and at most b-1. Similarly, d0 must be between 0 and b-1.

So, for each base b, d1 can range from 1 to b-1, and d0 can range from 0 to b-1.

Given that n is a two-digit number in base b, n must satisfy:

b <= n < b^2.

And since n is (d1 + d0)^2, we also have:

b <= (d1 + d0)^2 < b^2.

Which means that the square of (d1 + d0) is between b and b^2.

Let me think about possible values of (d1 + d0). Let's denote s = d1 + d0. Then, we have:

b <= s^2 < b^2

So, taking square roots:

sqrt(b) <= s < b.

But s is the sum of two digits, d1 and d0. The maximum possible s would be when d1 = b-1 and d0 = b-1, so s_max = 2*(b-1). The minimum s is when d1=1, d0=0, so s_min = 1.

Wait, but from the inequality sqrt(b) <= s < b. So, that gives a lower bound on s, which depends on b. So, for each b, s must be an integer such that sqrt(b) <= s < b.

But s is also equal to d1 + d0, and since d1 >=1 and d0 >=0, s can be as low as 1 and as high as 2*(b-1). But the inequality sqrt(b) <= s < b restricts s to be from sqrt(b) up to b-1, since s must be less than b.

Wait, so s must satisfy sqrt(b) <= s <= b-1.

And since s is an integer, s can take integer values from ceil(sqrt(b)) up to floor(b-1).

But since s is less than b, and s must be integer, s can be from ceil(sqrt(b)) to b-1, inclusive.

So, for each b, the possible s's are integers between ceil(sqrt(b)) and b-1.

And for each such s, we can try to find the number of pairs (d1, d0) such that d1 + d0 = s, and d1*b + d0 = s^2.

Wait, but we
