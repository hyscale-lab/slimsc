Okay, so I have this math problem here about rectangular boxes with a surface area of 54 and a volume of 23. I need to find the radius of the smallest sphere that can contain each of these boxes. Then, I have to express r squared as a fraction p/q where p and q are coprime, and find p + q. Hmm, sounds a bit involved, but let me break it down.

First, let's think about the rectangular boxes. A rectangular box has three dimensions: length, width, and height. Let me denote these as x, y, and z. So, surface area S and volume V are given by:

Surface area S = 2(xy + yz + zx) = 54

Volume V = xyz = 23

And I need to find the smallest sphere that can contain such a box. The sphere's radius will be half the space diagonal of the box because the sphere must enclose the entire box. The space diagonal d of a box is given by sqrt(x² + y² + z²). So, the radius r is d/2, which means r² is (x² + y² + z²)/4.

So, my goal is to minimize r², which is equivalent to minimizing x² + y² + z². Therefore, I need to find the minimum value of x² + y² + z² given the constraints on the surface area and volume.

So, the optimization problem is: minimize x² + y² + z² subject to 2(xy + yz + zx) = 54 and xyz = 23.

This seems like a problem that can be approached using Lagrange multipliers, but since it's three variables, that might get a bit messy. Maybe there's a way to express variables in terms of each other.

Let me consider using substitution. Let me define variables a = x, b = y, c = z. Then, the surface area equation is 2(ab + bc + ca) = 54, so ab + bc + ca = 27.

Volume is abc = 23.

I need to minimize a² + b² + c².

Hmm, perhaps I can use the method of Lagrange multipliers here. Let me set up the function to minimize, f(a,b,c) = a² + b² + c², and the constraints g(a,b,c) = ab + bc + ca - 27 = 0 and h(a,b,c) = abc - 23 = 0.

So, the Lagrangian would be:

L = a² + b² + c² - λ(ab + bc + ca - 27) - μ(abc - 23)

We take partial derivatives with respect to a, b, c, λ, μ and set them to zero.

Partial derivative with respect to a:

2a - λ(b + c) - μ(bc) = 0

Similarly for b:

2b - λ(a + c) - μ(ac) = 0

And for c:

2c - λ(a + b) - μ(ab) = 0

So, now we have three equations:

1) 2a = λ(b + c) + μ(bc)
2) 2b = λ(a + c) + μ(ac)
3) 2c = λ(a + b) + μ(ab)

Now, perhaps we can subtract equation 1 and 2 to eliminate some variables.

Subtracting equation 2 from 1:

2a - 2b = λ(b + c - a - c) + μ(bc - ac)

Simplify:

2(a - b) = λ(b - a) + μ c (b - a)

Factor out (b - a):

2(a - b) = -(a - b)(λ + μ c)

So, if a ≠ b, we can divide both sides by (a - b):

2 = -(λ + μ c)

Similarly, subtracting equation 1 from 3:

2c - 2a = λ(a + b - b - c) + μ(ab - bc)

Simplify:

2(c - a) = λ(a - c) + μ b (a - c)

Factor out (a - c):

2(c - a) = -(c - a)(λ + μ b)

Again, if c ≠ a, we can divide both sides by (c - a):

2 = -(λ + μ b)

Similarly, from equation 2 and equation 3:

Subtracting equation 2 from 3:

2c - 2b = λ(a + b - a - c) + μ(ab - ac)

Simplify:

2(c - b) = λ(b - c) + μ a (b - c)

Factor out (b - c):

2(c - b) = -(c - b)(λ + μ a)

If c ≠ b, divide both sides:

2 = -(λ + μ a)

So, from these three results:

2 = -(λ + μ c)  --> equation A

2 = -(λ + μ b)  --> equation B

2 = -(λ + μ a)  --> equation C

So, from A and B:

-(λ + μ c) = -(λ + μ b) => μ c = μ b

If μ ≠ 0, then c = b.

Similarly, from A and C:

-(λ + μ c) = -(λ + μ a) => μ c = μ a => c = a if μ ≠0.

So, if μ ≠0, then a = b = c.

But wait, if a = b = c, then the box is a cube.

But then, let's check if the cube satisfies the surface area and volume.

For a cube, each face is a square, so surface area 6a² = 54 => a²=9 => a=3.

Volume would then be a³ = 27. But the volume is given as 23, which is less than 27.

So, a cube isn't possible here because the volume is too low. Therefore, the assumption that μ ≠0 leads to a cube, which doesn't satisfy the volume condition. Hence, μ must be zero.

So, if μ = 0, then equations A, B, C become 2 = -λ.

So, λ = -2.

So, now, going back to the original partial derivatives:

From equation 1: 2a = λ(b + c) + μ bc. But μ=0, so:

2a = λ(b + c) = (-2)(b + c)

So, 2a = -2(b + c) → a = -(b + c)

Wait, but that's odd because a, b, c are lengths, so they should be positive. So, a = -(b + c) would make a negative, which is impossible. So, this suggests that our assumption that all a, b, c are positive and μ=0 leads to a contradiction.

Hmm, that's a problem. So, perhaps, our initial approach needs to be adjusted.

Alternatively, maybe two variables are equal, and the third is different. Let me assume that a = b, but c is different.

So, if a = b, then let's denote a = b = k, and c = m.

So, now, the surface area equation becomes 2(k² + km + km) = 54 → 2(k² + 2km) =54 → k² + 2km =27.

Volume becomes k² m = 23.

We need to find k and m such that these two equations hold.

We can express m from the volume equation: m = 23 / k².

Substitute into the surface area equation:

k² + 2k*(23 / k²) = 27.

Simplify:

k² + (46 / k) = 27.

Multiply both sides by k to eliminate the denominator:

k^3 + 46 = 27k.

Rearranged: k^3 -27k +46 =0.

So, we have the equation k^3 -27k +46 =0. Let's try to find real roots.

We can try rational roots. Possible roots are factors of 46 over 1, so ±1, ±2, ±23, ±46.

Testing k=1: 1 -27 +46 =20 ≠0.

k=2:8 -54 +46=0 → 8-54= -46 +46=0. So, k=2 is a root.

So, we can factor out (k-2):

Using polynomial division or synthetic division.

Divide k^3 -27k +46 by (k -2):

Using synthetic division:

2 | 1  0  -27  46

          2   4  -46

      1  2  -23  0

So, the polynomial factors as (k -2)(k² + 2k -23) =0.

Thus, the other roots come from k² +2k -23=0.

Using quadratic formula: k = [-2 ± sqrt(4 +92)] /2 = [-2 ± sqrt(96)] /2 = [-2 ± 4*sqrt(6)] /2 = -1 ± 2*sqrt(6).

Since k must be positive, only k= -1 + 2*sqrt(6) would be positive, but let me compute that: sqrt(6)≈2.45, so 2*sqrt(6)≈4.90, so -1 +4.90≈3.90, which is positive.

So, the roots are k=2 and k= -1 + 2√6 ≈3.90.

So, possible k=2. Let's see what m is for k=2.

m =23 /k² =23/4≈5.75.

So, in this case, a = b =2, c≈5.75.

Alternatively, for k= -1+2√6≈3.90, m=23/k². Let's compute k²:

k² = ( -1 + 2√6 )² = 1 -4√6 + 24 = 25 -4√6.

So, m=23/(25 -4√6). Let's rationalize denominator:

Multiply numerator and denominator by (25 +4√6):

m =23*(25 +4√6)/[(25)^2 - (4√6)^2] =23*(25 +4√6)/(625 - 16*6)=23*(25 +4√6)/(625-96)=23*(25 +4√6)/529.

Simplify:

529 is 23², so 23 cancels with denominator:

m=(25 +4√6)/23.

So, m≈(25 +4*2.45)/23≈(25 +9.8)/23≈34.8/23≈1.513.

So, for k= -1 + 2√6≈3.90, m≈1.513.

So, in this case, a= b≈3.90, c≈1.513.

So, now, with a = b, we have two possibilities for (a, b, c): either (2,2,23/4) or (-1+2√6, -1+2√6, (25 +4√6)/23).

Now, we need to compute x² + y² + z² for each case.

First case: a = b=2, c=23/4=5.75.

Compute x² + y² + z² = 2² + 2² + (23/4)² =4 +4 + (529/16)=8 +529/16.

Convert 8 to 128/16, so 128/16 +529/16=657/16≈41.0625.

Second case: a = b= -1 + 2√6 ≈3.90, c= (25 +4√6)/23≈1.513.

Compute x² + y² + z² = 2*(-1 + 2√6)^2 + [(25 +4√6)/23]^2.

First, compute (-1 +2√6)^2: 1 -4√6 +24=25 -4√6.

So, 2*(25 -4√6)=50 -8√6.

Now, compute [(25 +4√6)/23]^2:

(25 +4√6)^2 =625 + 200√6 + 16*6=625 +200√6 +96=721 +200√6.

Divide by 23²=529.

So, [(25 +4√6)/23]^2=(721 +200√6)/529.

Now, add to the previous term:

50 -8√6 + (721 +200√6)/529.

Let me convert 50 to 50*529/529=26450/529.

Similarly, -8√6 is -8√6 *529/529= -4232√6/529.

So, total expression becomes:

[26450 -4232√6 +721 +200√6]/529.

Combine like terms:

26450 +721 =27171.

-4232√6 +200√6 = (-4232 +200)√6= -4032√6.

So, the numerator is 27171 -4032√6.

So, x² + y² + z²=(27171 -4032√6)/529.

Compute this numerically to see which case is smaller.

First case: ≈41.0625.

Second case: Compute numerator:

27171 ≈27171.

4032√6 ≈4032 *2.449≈4032*2.45≈4032*2 +4032*0.45=8064 +1814.4=9878.4.

So, numerator≈27171 -9878.4=17292.6.

Denominator 529≈529.

So, 17292.6 /529≈32.68.

So, x² + y² + z²≈32.68, which is less than 41.06, so the second case is better.

So, the minimal x² + y² + z² is (27171 -4032√6)/529≈32.68.

Wait, but perhaps it's even smaller when all variables are equal? But we saw earlier that a cube (equal variables) doesn't
