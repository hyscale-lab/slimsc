Okay, so I have this problem about a hyperbola and a rhombus. Let me break it down and see if I can figure it out step by step.

The hyperbola is given by the equation x²/20 - y²/24 = 1. That's a standard hyperbola centered at the origin, opening horizontally. So, its transverse axis is along the x-axis, and the conjugate axis is along the y-axis.

We have four points A, B, C, D on this hyperbola, forming a rhombus ABCD. The diagonals of the rhombus intersect at the origin, which is the center of the hyperbola. I need to find the greatest real number that is less than BD² for all such rhombi. So, essentially, I'm looking for the infimum of BD², which is the lower bound for BD² across all possible such rhombuses.

First, let's recall some properties of a rhombus. In a rhombus, all sides are equal in length, and the diagonals bisect each other at right angles. Wait, no, actually, they bisect each other but not necessarily at right angles unless it's a square. Hmm, wait, no, in a rhombus, the diagonals bisect each other at right angles. Yeah, that's right. So, the diagonals are perpendicular bisectors of each other. So, if the diagonals intersect at the origin, then the origin is the midpoint of both diagonals.

Since ABCD is a rhombus, points A, B, C, D lie on the hyperbola, and the diagonals are AC and BD. The diagonals intersect at the origin, so if point A is (x, y), then point C must be (-x, -y) because the diagonals bisect each other at the origin. Similarly, if point B is (p, q), then point D must be (-p, -q).

Wait, but in a rhombus, the diagonals are not necessarily equal in length, but they do intersect at right angles. So, the diagonals AC and BD are perpendicular. So, the vectors AC and BD are perpendicular.

Since the hyperbola is symmetric, the points are arranged such that A and C are endpoints of one diagonal, and B and D are endpoints of the other diagonal. So, each pair (A, C) and (B, D) is symmetric about the origin.
