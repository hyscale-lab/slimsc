Okay, so I've got this geometry problem here about two rectangles, ABCD and EFGH. The problem says that points D, E, C, F are collinear. Also, points A, D, H, G lie on a circle. The given lengths are BC = 16, AB = 107, FG = 17, and EF = 184. I need to find the length of CE.

Hmm, let me try to visualize this. So, we have two rectangles. Rectangle ABCD has sides AB = 107 and BC = 16. Since it's a rectangle, opposite sides are equal, so AD = BC = 16 and AB = CD = 107. Rectangle EFGH has sides FG = 17 and EF = 184, so EF = GH = 184 and FG = EH = 17.

Wait, but the problem mentions that D, E, C, F are collinear. So, if I imagine the points D, E, C, F lying on a straight line in that order, then E is somewhere between D and C, and F is beyond C.

Also, A, D, H, G lie on a circle. That means these four points are concyclic or lie on the same circumference. So, quadrilateral ADHG is cyclic.

Since ABCD and EFGH are rectangles, all their angles are right angles. I think I can use some properties of cyclic quadrilaterals here. In cyclic quadrilaterals, the opposite angles sum to 180 degrees. Also, the power of a point might come into play if there are intersecting chords or something.

Let me draw a rough sketch in my mind. Rectangle ABCD: points A, B, C, D arranged such that AB and CD are the long sides (107 units) and BC and AD are the short sides (16 units). Rectangle EFGH: points E, F, G, H arranged with EF and GH as the long sides (184 units) and FG and EH as the short sides (17 units). Points D, E, C, F are collinear, so E is on DC extended beyond D, and F is beyond C on DC.

Wait, no, maybe E is between D and C, and F is beyond C? Or maybe E is beyond D, and F is beyond C. Hmm, the problem doesn't specify the order beyond being collinear, but I think it's more likely that E is on the extension of DC beyond D, and F is on the extension beyond C. Because if E were between D and C, then F would have to be beyond C to be collinear, but EF would have to be longer than DC, which is 107, but EF is given as 184, which is longer. Hmm, maybe that's possible.

Wait, no, if E is between D and C, then F would need to be beyond C on DC. But EF would then be part of the same line as DC, but EF is 184, which is longer than DC, which is 107. So, maybe E is beyond D, and F is beyond C, so that the distance E-F goes through D and C.

Wait,
