Okay, let's try to solve this problem step by step. So, we have a torus T and a sphere S. The torus is created by revolving a circle with radius 3 around an axis that's 6 units away from the center of the circle. The sphere has a radius of 11.

The problem is asking about the difference between two radii: r_i, which is the radius of the circle where the torus is internally tangent to the sphere, and r_o, the radius where it's externally tangent. Then, we need to find r_i - r_o expressed as a fraction m/n, and then m + n.

Hmm, okay. Let me recall what a torus is. A torus is like a donut shape, right? It's formed by rotating a circle around an external axis. So, in this case, the circle has a radius of 3, and the distance from the center of the circle to the axis of rotation is 6. So, the major radius (the distance from the center of the tube to the center of the torus) is 6, and the minor radius (the radius of the tube itself) is 3.

Now, the sphere S has a radius of 11. When the torus is placed inside the sphere, it will be tangent along a circle. Similarly, when placed outside, it will be tangent along another circle.

I think I need to visualize this. When the torus is inside the sphere, the sphere is larger, so the point of tangency would be somewhere on the outer part of the torus. Conversely, when the torus is outside, the sphere is inside the torus, so the tangency is on the inner part of the torus.

Wait, maybe I'm mixing things up. Let me think again. When the torus is inside the sphere (internally tangent), the sphere is larger, so the point where they touch is on the outer equator of the torus. When the torus is outside the sphere (externally tangent), the sphere is inside the torus, so the tangency is on the inner equator of the torus.

Wait, but the sphere is fixed with radius 11. So, when the torus is inside, the sphere has a radius larger than the torus's major radius, right? Because the torus's major radius is 6, and the sphere is 11, so yeah, the sphere is much larger. Hmm, but actually, the sphere isn't necessarily just a point; it's a solid object.

Wait, no, no, I think I need to approach this more mathematically.

Let me consider the equations of the torus and the sphere.

The standard equation for a torus centered at the origin, with major radius R and minor radius r, is:

(√(x² + y²) - R)² + z² = r².

In our case, R is 6, and r is 3. So, the equation is:

(√(x² + y²) - 6)² + z² = 3² = 9.

The sphere S has a radius of 11, so its equation is x² + y² + z² = 11² = 121.

Now, when the torus is internally tangent to the sphere, their surfaces touch at exactly one point? No, wait, no. It says along a circle. So, it's tangent along a circle, which suggests that they are tangent at infinitely many points forming a circle.

I think when the torus is inside the sphere, the point of tangency is a circle that lies on both surfaces. Similarly for the external case.

So, to find r_i and r_o, I need to find the radii of these circles where the two surfaces are tangent.

Wait, but the torus is a surface of revolution, and so is the sphere. So, their intersection, when tangent, should lie along a circle that is a result of both symmetries.

Let me try to think in terms of cross-sections. If I take a cross-section in the plane of
