Okay, so I have this problem about counting the number of paths on an 8x8 grid. The paths are from the lower left corner to the upper right corner, have a length of 16, and they change direction exactly four times. Hmm, I need to figure this out.

First, let me visualize the grid. It's an 8x8 grid, so there are 8 rows and 8 columns. Moving from the lower left to the upper right means moving from (0,0) to (8,8). Since each step can only move right or up, the total number of steps is 16: 8 right and 8 up.

Wait, but the problem is about paths that change direction exactly four times. That might relate to the number of times the path switches from moving right to up or vice versa. So, for example, a path that goes all the way right and then all the way up has only one change in direction. Similarly, a path that alternates right and up every step would change direction many times.

So, I need to count paths that change direction exactly four times. Let me think about how direction changes relate to the number of straight segments in the path.

Each time the path changes direction, it starts a new segment. So, if there are four direction changes, the path is divided into five segments. So, the path consists of five straight lines, each either moving right or up.

Wait, that makes sense. For example, one direction change leads to two segments, two changes lead to three segments, etc. So, four changes mean five segments.

Now, these five segments must alternate between right and up movements. Because each time you change direction, you switch from right to up or up to right.

So, the path can start with a right move, then up, then right, then up, then right, or it can start with up, then right, then up, then right, then up. So there are two possibilities for the starting direction.

Therefore, the number of such paths would depend on how the directions alternate and how the steps are divided among the segments.

Let me model this. Suppose the path starts with a right move, then alternates. So, the five segments would be R, U, R, U, R. Alternatively, if it starts with U, the segments would be U, R, U, R, U.

Wait, but five segments: starting with R would give us three R segments and two U segments, because it
