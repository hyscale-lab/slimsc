Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the number of ways to place some chips on a 5x5 grid. The chips can be either white or black, and there are 25 of each. The conditions are that each cell can have at most one chip, all chips in the same row or column must be the same color, and you can't add any more chips without violating those conditions. Hmm, this seems a bit tricky, but let me break it down.

First, let's understand the constraints. Each row must have chips of the same color. So, for each row, I can choose either white or black, but once I choose, all chips in that row must be of that color. Same goes for each column. Wait, but there's a catch: each column must also have all chips of the same color. So, if I have a row that's all white, then for each column in that row, the column must also be all white because the cell in that row and column is white. But that might conflict with other rows.

Wait, no. Let me think again. Each row's chips are the same color, and each column's chips are the same color. So, the color of the chips in a row must be compatible with the colors in the columns they intersect. That is, if a row is white, then every column that has a chip in that row must also be white. Similarly, if a row is black, every column with a chip in that row must be black. So, the colors of the rows and columns can't conflict at their intersections.

Wait, but how does that work? Let me consider a smaller grid, like 2x2, to get a better idea. Suppose I have a 2x2 grid. If I decide that the first row is white, then both columns in that row must have white chips, but the other rows can be either white or black. But wait, no—the columns have to be all same color as well. So, if the first row is white, then the columns intersecting those white chips must also be white. So, if a column has a white chip, it can't have any black chips elsewhere.

Wait, that's a key point. If a column has any chip, all the chips in that column must be the same color. So, if the first row is white, then the columns in that row must be white, meaning any other rows that have chips in those columns must also be white. So, if I have a row that's white, all the columns that pass through that row must also be white. Similarly, if I have a row that's black, all the columns in that row must be black.

Wait, but that seems like it would limit the possibilities. Because if you have a white row, then all the columns in that row must be white, so any other rows that intersect those columns can't be black because that would require those columns to be both white and black, which is impossible.

So, perhaps the only way this works is if all the rows and columns that are white form a rectangle (or maybe a union of rectangles), and the same with black. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe the grid is divided into blocks where each block is entirely white or black, and within each block, all rows and columns are of that color.

Wait, another thought: for each cell, the color must be the same as all other cells in its row and column. So, if a cell is white, then the entire row and column must be white. Similarly for black. But wait, that can't be right because then the entire grid would have to be all white or all black. But that's not necessarily the case because the problem allows some cells to be empty.

Wait, wait, no. The problem states that each cell can have at most one chip, but it doesn't say that every cell must have a chip. So, perhaps you can have some rows with white chips and some without, but when you do place chips, the same color applies to the entire row and column.

Wait, maybe the grid is partitioned into white and black regions, where each region is a rectangle, and within each rectangle, all the cells are either white or black. So, each rectangle must be entirely white or entirely black, and they can't overlap. So, the grid is a union of non-overlapping rectangles, each of which is entirely white or black.

Wait, but how does that work with the conditions? Let me think. Suppose I have a white rectangle in the top-left corner, covering rows 1-2 and columns 1-3. Then all those cells must be white, meaning that the rows 1-2 can't have any black chips, and columns 1-3 can't have any black chips. Similarly, any black rectangles must be placed such that they don't interfere with the white regions.

But wait, no. Because each row and column can only have chips of a single color. So, if a row has any white chips, the entire row must be white. Similarly, any column with a white chip must have all white chips in that column. So, actually, the placement of white chips must form a rectangle covering all the cells in their rows and columns. Similarly for black chips.

Wait, that makes more sense. So, if I decide that row 1 is white, then all cells in row 1 must be white, which would require that all columns intersecting row 1 must also be white. So, if row 1 is white, then columns 1-5 would have to be white in their first row, but since each column must have all chips the same color, then the entire column would have to be white. So, if any cell is white, the entire row and column must be white.

Wait, that would imply that the white region is a rectangle covering entire rows and entire columns. Similarly, the black region would be another rectangle, but they can't overlap. So, perhaps the grid is divided into white and black rectangles that don't overlap.

But wait, that doesn't seem right because then the only possibilities would be placing a white rectangle and a black rectangle that don't overlap, but the entire grid can't be both white and black. Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating it.

Wait, another approach: since each row and each column can only be all white, all black, or empty, perhaps the grid is covered by a union of white and black rectangles, but each row and column can only be in one of these colors. So, if a row is white, all its cells are white, and if a column is white, all its cells are white. But that would mean that the white regions form a rectangle covering entire rows and columns, and the same for black.

Wait, but that's only possible if the white and black regions are rectangles that don't overlap. For example, you could have a white rectangle covering the top-left 2x3 area, and a black rectangle covering the bottom-right 3x2 area, but then their intersection would require those cells to be both white and black, which is impossible. Therefore, the white and black regions must form a partition of the grid into rectangles, where each rectangle is entirely white or entirely black, and they don't overlap.

Wait, but this seems restrictive. For example, if I have a white rectangle covering rows 1-2 and columns 1-3, then all cells in rows 1-2 and columns 1-3 are white. Then, the remaining cells (rows 3-5 and columns 4-5) could be black. But that would require that all columns 4-5 in rows 3-5 are black, which is possible. So, in this case, the white region is a rectangle covering part of the grid, and the black region is another rectangle covering the remaining part.

But wait, no, because the black region would have to cover all the remaining rows and columns. So, if I have white in rows 1-2 and columns 1-3, then the columns 1-3 in rows 3-5 would have to be white as well, which contradicts the idea of having a black region there. So, maybe that approach isn't correct.

Wait, perhaps each row and each column can be in one of three states: all white, all black, or empty. But if a row is non-empty, it must be all white or all black. Similarly for columns. So, the non-empty rows and columns must be monochromatic, and the empty rows and columns can be anywhere.

Wait, but that's not entirely accurate because a row could have some cells empty and others filled, but then the filled cells would require the entire row and column to be of that color, leading to the entire row and column being filled with chips of that color. So, perhaps the only way to place the chips is to have a set of rows and columns that are non-empty, each assigned a color (white or black), such that any row and column that are non-empty must have all their chips of that color, and the regions where they overlap must be consistent.

Wait, perhaps the grid is divided into four regions: white rows, white columns, black rows, and black columns. But that seems confusing.

Alternatively, perhaps the placement of white and black chips must form a partition of the grid into white and black rectangles, each of which is a rectangle covering entire rows and columns. For example, all white rows are at the top, followed by all black rows, and similarly for columns. But that might not account for all possibilities.

Wait, let's think in terms of possible color assignments. Each row can be white, black, or empty. Similarly, each column can be white, black, or empty. But with the constraint that if a row is white, then all columns in that row must also be white, and vice versa for black.

Wait, no, the columns can be any color, but if a column has a white chip, then the entire column must be white. Similarly for black. So, the placement of a white chip in a column forces that entire column to be white. So, the white region must be a union of entire rows and entire columns, but that's not possible unless the white region is a rectangle.

Wait, maybe the white region is a rectangle covering some rows and some columns, and the same for the black region. For example, if I choose rows 1-3 and columns 1-4 to be white, then all cells in rows 1-3 and columns 1-4 must be white. But then, the cells in rows 1-3 and columns 5 would have to be white as well because they're in those rows. Wait, that's a problem because columns 5 is not in the initially chosen columns. So, that approach doesn't work.

Hmm, maybe I'm approaching this incorrectly. Let's think of the grid as being partitioned into four regions:

1. White rows and white columns: their intersection is white.
2. White rows and black columns: their intersection is black.
3. Black rows and white columns: their intersection is black.
4. Black rows and black columns: their intersection is white.

Wait, that seems too vague. Maybe it's better to model this as a bipartite graph where rows and columns are nodes, and edges represent cells. But I'm not sure how that would help.

Wait, another idea: since each row and column must be monochromatic, the placement of chips must form a grid where the white and black regions are each a union of entire rows and entire columns. So, for example, if rows 1-2 are white and columns 3-5 are white, then the intersection would require those cells to be white, but also that any cells in rows 1-2 and columns 1-2 must be white as well because the columns are white. So, that would mean the entire top-left 2x5 area is white, but that's not a rectangle. Wait, no, because if the columns 3-5 are white, then any row that intersects them must also be white. So, if rows 1-2 are white, then columns 1-5 would have to be white because of the rows. So, that's not possible.

Wait, maybe the only way is that all white rows are a set of consecutive rows, and all white columns are a set of consecutive columns, and their intersection is the white region. So, the white region would be a rectangle covering the top-left corner, and the black region would be the remaining area. Similarly for other positions.

Alternatively, perhaps the white and black regions are each a single rectangle, and they don't overlap. So, for example, the white region could be the top-left 3x3, and the black region could be the bottom-right 2x2. But then, the cells in row 4, column 4 would have to be both white and black, which is impossible. So, that approach might not work.

Wait, perhaps the white and black regions can't overlap, so they must be placed in such a way that their rectangles don't intersect. So, for example, the white region could be the top 2 rows, and the black region could be the bottom 3 rows, but then the columns would have to be partitioned in a way that doesn't cause conflicts.

Wait, maybe the problem is equivalent to choosing a subset of rows and columns, such that the intersection forms a rectangle, and the color of that rectangle can be either white or black. Then, the remaining rows and columns can have their own color, but again, without overlapping.

Wait, perhaps it's better to model this as selecting a subset of rows and columns, and assigning a color to that subset, ensuring that the selected rows and columns form a rectangle with no overlaps. But I'm not entirely sure.

Alternatively, think of it as a binary matrix where each cell is either white, black, or empty. But with the constraints that if a cell is white, then all cells in its row and column must also be white. Similarly for black. So, the white cells form a rectangle covering entire rows and columns, and the same for black cells. But since the grid is finite, the only way this can happen is if the white and black regions are non-overlapping rectangles, and their union covers the entire grid.

Wait, but that can't be because, for example, if I have a white rectangle covering the top-left 2x3 area, then all the rows 1-2 and columns 1-3 are white. Then, any cell in rows 1-2, columns 4-5 would have to be white because the rows are white, but the columns 4-5 would have to be black because otherwise, they'd have white and black chips. That's a contradiction. So, perhaps the white and black regions can't both be non-empty unless they are placed in a way that their rectangles don't interfere.

Wait, maybe the only possible configurations are where all the white regions are in the top-left corner, and the black regions are in the bottom-right, or something like that. But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think of the grid as being split into four quadrants:

- Top-left: white
- Top-right: black
- Bottom-left: black
- Bottom-right: white

But that would require that the rows and columns are partitioned in a way that the quadrants are consistent. For example, if rows 1-2 are white in columns 1-2, then the rest of the rows and columns must be black or white in a way that doesn't conflict.

Wait, I'm getting stuck here. Maybe I should approach the problem differently. Let's think about the possible colorings of the rows and columns.

Each row can be white, black, or empty. Similarly for each column. But if a row is non-empty (i.e., has some chips), then all its cells must be of that color. Similarly for columns.

Wait, but the chips are placed in the grid, so if a row is non-empty, it must have all its cells occupied by chips of that color. And the same for columns. So, if a row is white, then all its cells must have white chips, and similarly for black.

Wait, but in that case, each row and column can be either white, black, or empty, but if a row is non-empty, it's either all white or all black. Same for columns.

But then, the placement of chips must satisfy that all non-empty rows and columns are monochromatic. Also, the grid must be such that no additional chips can be placed without violating the conditions. So, the grid must be maximal in the sense that any empty cell cannot have a chip placed without causing a row or column to have conflicting colors.

Wait, so the grid is in a state where every empty cell is in a row and column that are already determined to be a single color. Otherwise, you could add a chip of that color without violating the constraints.

Therefore, the grid is such that every empty cell is in a row that's non-empty (so the row is monochromatic) and a column that's non-empty (so the column is monochromatic). But wait, no; if a row is non-empty, then all its cells must be of that row's color. So, if a row is non-empty and white, then all its cells are white, so any empty cell in that row can't have a black chip placed because the row is already white, but you could still place a white chip, but the problem states that the grid is maximal, meaning you can't add any more chips without violating the constraints. Therefore, every empty cell must be in a row and column that are already determined to be a single color, but that might not be the case.

Wait, no. The grid is maximal if adding any chip would cause a row or column to have multiple colors. So, for each empty cell (i,j), either row i is non-empty and already has a color, or column j is non-empty and already has a color. Otherwise, you could place a chip in (i,j) without violating the constraints.

Wait, perhaps the grid is such that the set of non-empty rows and non-empty columns form a rectangle. That is, the non-empty rows are a set of consecutive rows, and the non-empty columns are a set of consecutive columns, and their intersection is the non-empty cells. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the non-empty rows and non-empty columns can be any subsets, but their intersection must form a rectangle. Hmm, maybe not.

Wait, perhaps the problem is equivalent to choosing a subset of rows and columns such that the intersection forms a rectangle, and assigning a color to that rectangle, and the rest of the grid being empty. Then, the same can be done for another color, but without overlapping.

Wait, but how many ways can you choose such a rectangle? For each color, you can choose a rectangle, and the two rectangles must not overlap. So, for white, you can choose any rectangle, and for black, you can choose any rectangle that doesn't overlap with white. But then, the total number of ways would be the number of ways to choose two non-overlapping rectangles, one white and one black, plus the cases where only one color is used.

Wait, but I think this approach might not capture all possibilities because you could have multiple non-overlapping rectangles for each color. Hmm, maybe not. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps the grid can have any number of white and black rectangles, as long as they don't overlap. But each such rectangle must consist of entire rows and entire columns. So, each white rectangle is defined by selecting some rows and some columns, and their intersection is all white. Similarly for black.

But how do you count the number of ways to partition the grid into white and black rectangles, each covering entire rows and columns, without overlapping.

Wait, perhaps each such arrangement corresponds to a partition of the grid into two sets: white and black, each of which is a union of rectangles formed by entire rows and columns. But I'm not sure how to count that.

Alternatively, perhaps each row can be independently assigned to white or black, and each column as well, but with the constraint that if a row is assigned to white, then all columns in that row must be white, and vice versa. But this seems too vague.

Wait, maybe the key is to realize that the color assignment must be such that the white and black regions are each a union of entire rows and entire columns, and their intersection is empty. So, the white region can be any union of entire rows and entire columns, and the black region can be any union of entire rows and entire columns not overlapping with white.

Wait, but that can't be right because if a row is white, then all its columns are white, so any column that intersects that row must be white. Therefore, the white region is the union of some rows and some columns, but their intersection must form a rectangle.

Wait, perhaps the white region is the union of some rows and some columns, but the overlapping part is a rectangle. For example, if I choose rows 1-2 and columns 1-3, then the white region is the union of these rows and columns, which forms a sort of cross, but that's not a rectangle. But according to the problem, the white chips must form a rectangle because each row and column in the white region must be entirely white.

Wait, no. If I choose rows 1-2 and columns 1-3, then the cells in rows 1-2 and columns 1-3 are white, but the cells in rows 1-2, columns 4-5 would also have to be white because the rows are white. Similarly, the cells in rows 3-5, columns 1-3 would have to be white because the columns are white. So, the white region would actually cover the entire top 2 rows and the entire left 3 columns, forming a sort of rectangle that's 2x3 plus the 3x2 on the bottom left, but that's overlapping.

Wait, no, that's impossible because the rows and columns can't be both white and black. So, perhaps the only way this works is if the white and black regions are non-overlapping and each is a rectangle formed by entire rows and columns.

Wait, perhaps the grid is divided into two rectangles: a white rectangle covering some rows and columns, and a black rectangle covering the remaining rows and columns. So, for example, the white rectangle could be the top-left 2x3, and the black rectangle the bottom-right 3x2, but then the remaining cells (rows 3-5, columns 1-3 and rows 1-2, columns 4-5) would have to be empty, which is allowed. But wait, no, because if the white rectangle is top-left 2x3, then rows 1-2 would have all their columns 1-3 as white, but columns 1-3 would also have rows 3-5 as white, which would require those cells to be white as well, conflicting with the black rectangle.

Ah, so that's a problem. Therefore, the white and black regions must not only be non-overlapping but also such that the white region doesn't force any columns or rows to be white that would interfere with the black region.

Wait, so perhaps the only way is to have the white region consist of some consecutive rows and some consecutive columns, and the black region consist of the remaining consecutive rows and columns. For example, white could cover the top a rows and left b columns, and black could cover the bottom (5-a) rows and right (5-b) columns, ensuring that their overlap is zero. Then, the white region is a rectangle of size a x b, and the black region is a rectangle of size (5-a) x (5-b). The remaining cells (if any) would be empty.

Wait, that makes sense. So, in this case, the grid is divided into four regions:

1. Top-left a x b: white.
2. Top-right a x (5 - b): empty.
3. Bottom-left (5 - a) x b: empty.
4. Bottom-right (5 - a) x (5 - b): black.

Wait, no, because if the white region is a x b, then the columns 1 to b in the top a rows are white, but the columns 1 to b in the bottom (5 - a) rows would also have to be white because their columns are white. So, that's not possible unless the white region also covers those. Therefore, perhaps the only way to have a white region without conflicting with a black region is to have the white region be a rectangle covering the top a rows and all columns, or all rows and left b columns. Similarly for black.

Wait, maybe the white region can be a rectangle that spans entire rows and entire columns, but in such a way that the black region can also be a rectangle without overlapping. So, for example, white could cover the top a rows and all 5 columns, making the entire top a rows white. Then, the black region could cover the bottom (5 - a) rows, but only some columns. But then, the black region's columns would have to be entirely black, which would require that the top a rows in those columns are also black, which conflicts with the white region.

Hmm, this is getting complicated. Maybe another approach is needed.

Wait, perhaps the problem is equivalent to choosing a subset of rows and columns, and assigning a color to that subset, such that the subset forms a rectangle, and the remaining rows and columns form another rectangle of the other color. So, for each possible partition of the rows into a and (5 - a), and the columns into b and (5 - b), we can have a white rectangle of a x b and a black rectangle of (5 - a) x (5 - b). But that's only possible if the white and black regions don't overlap.

Wait, but the white rectangle would cover a x b cells, and the black would cover (5 - a) x (5 - b). The remaining cells would be empty. For example, if a = 2 and b = 3, then the white region is 2x3, the black region is 3x2, and the remaining cells are empty. But wait, in this case, the white region's columns would require that all rows in those columns are white, which would include the black region's rows, causing a conflict.

So, perhaps the only way this works is if the white region is either a set of entire rows or entire columns, and the same for black. For example, white could cover the first a rows, and black could cover the first b columns, but that might not work unless a + b <=5 or something.

Wait, maybe the only valid configurations are those where either all the white chips form a rectangle covering entire rows and entire columns, and the black chips form another such rectangle without overlapping. So, for example, white could be the top a rows and left b columns, and black could be the bottom (5 - a) rows and right (5 - b) columns. But then, the cells in rows a+1 to 5 and columns b+1 to 5 would be black, but the cells in rows 1 to a and columns b+1 to 5 would be empty, as would the cells in rows a+1 to 5 and columns 1 to b.

Wait, but in that case, the white region is a x b, and the black region is (5 - a) x (5 - b), and the remaining cells are empty. But we have to ensure that the white and black regions don't cause any conflicts in their rows and columns.

Wait, for the white region: rows 1 to a are white, columns 1 to b are white. So, the intersection of these is the white rectangle. Then, the black region is rows a+1 to 5 and columns b+1 to 5. But in this case, the columns b+1 to 5 in rows a+1 to 5 are black, but the rows a+1 to 5 in columns 1 to b would have to be black as well because the columns are black. However, those cells are in rows a+1 to 5 and columns 1 to b, which are not part of the black region as defined. Therefore, this approach leads to a conflict because those cells would have to be both white (from the rows 1 to a) and black (from the columns b+1 to 5), which is impossible.

Hmm, so perhaps this approach isn't correct. Maybe the only valid configurations are those where either all the white chips form a rectangle covering entire rows, and the black chips form a rectangle covering entire columns, or vice versa.

Wait, another idea: the grid can be divided into white and black regions where the white is a rectangle of a rows and b columns, and the black is a rectangle of c rows and d columns, such that a + c <=5 and b + d <=5, and the white and black regions don't overlap. But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the problem is equivalent to choosing a subset of rows and a subset of columns, assigning a color to each, such that the intersection of the chosen rows and columns is monochromatic, and the rest are empty. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is equivalent to choosing a partition of the grid's rows into white and black, and similarly for columns, such that the white regions form rectangles, and so do the black regions. But again, I'm not sure.

Wait, maybe I should think in terms of possible color assignments. Each row can be white, black, or empty. Each column can be white, black, or empty. But with the constraints that:

- If a row is white, then all cells in that row must be white.
- If a column is white, then all cells in that column must be white.
- Similarly for black.

But wait, no. Because if a row is white, then the columns in that row must be white, but the columns could have been white or black otherwise. But if a column is white, then all the cells in that column must be white, which could include cells from other rows that were previously not assigned a color.

Wait, perhaps the color assignments for rows and columns must be consistent. For example, if row i is white, then all columns j in row i must be white, which in turn forces all cells in column j to be white. So, the only way this can happen is if the white region is a rectangle covering entire rows and columns, and similarly for black.

Wait, this suggests that the white and black regions must each be rectangles covering entire rows and columns, and their intersection must be empty. So, the white region could be the top a rows and left b columns, and the black region could be the bottom (5 - a) rows and right (5 - b) columns, but only if a + (5 - a) =5 and b + (5 - b) =5, which they are, but ensuring that the white and black regions don't overlap.

Wait, but in this case, the white region would be a x b, and the black region would be (5 - a) x (5 - b). However, the cells in rows a+1 to 5 and columns 1 to b would have to be black because the columns are black, but those cells are in the white region's columns, which are white. That's a conflict.

So, perhaps the only way to avoid this is to have either all the white region's columns or all the black region's rows, but not both. Alternatively, perhaps the white region is a rectangle covering some rows and all columns, and the black region is a rectangle covering some other rows and all columns, but that would cause overlapping.

Wait, maybe the white region is a rectangle covering a certain number of rows and all columns, and the black region is a rectangle covering a certain number of columns and all rows. But I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach: Since each row and column must be monochromatic, the only way to place chips is to have each non-empty row and column be entirely white or entirely black. So, the grid can be represented by a bipartition of rows and columns into white and black, such that the white and black regions don't conflict.

Wait, perhaps the solution is that the grid can be split into four regions:

1. White rows and white columns: their intersection is white.
2. White rows and black columns: their intersection is black.
3. Black rows and white columns: their intersection is black.
4. Black rows and black columns: their intersection is white.

But this seems too vague. Alternatively, perhaps the number of ways is related to the number of possible ways to choose a subset of rows and columns to be white, ensuring that the subset forms a rectangle, and similarly for black, without overlapping.

Wait, but I'm not making progress. Maybe I should think about small cases to find a pattern.

Let's consider a 1x1 grid. How many ways? Well, we can have:

- No chips: 1 way.
- One white chip: 1 way.
- One black chip: 1 way.

But according to the problem, the grid must be maximal, meaning you can't add any more chips. So, if you have a 1x1 grid and no chips, you can add a chip, so it's not maximal. If you have a white chip, you can't add a black chip, so it's maximal. Similarly for black. So, the number of ways is 2.

Wait, but in our problem, the chips are indistinct except for color, and we have 25 of each. Hmm, but in the 1x1 case, the answer would be 2, but according to our earlier reasoning, it's 2.

Wait, but in the problem statement, it's a 5x5 grid. So, perhaps the answer is related to 3^5 or something, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another idea: Each row can be white, black, or empty, and each column can be white, black, or empty, but with the constraints that:

- If a row is white, then all its columns must be white.
- If a column is white, then all its rows must be white.
- Similarly for black.

But this seems too restrictive, leading to only a few possibilities.

Wait, perhaps the grid must be such that all non-empty rows are white, and all non-empty columns are white, and similarly for black. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the grid can be split into two parts: a white rectangle and a black rectangle, each covering entire rows and columns, and their intersection is empty. So, the number of ways would be the number of ways to choose a white rectangle and a black rectangle that don't overlap.

Wait, but how many such ways are there? For each possible white rectangle, the black rectangle must be in the remaining rows and columns. But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the number of possible configurations is (2^5 - 1) * (2^5 - 1) = 31 * 31 = 961, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach: Each row can be either white, black, or empty. Similarly for each column. But the assignments must be consistent. For example, if row i is white, then all columns in row i must be white. Similarly, if column j is white, then all rows in column j must be white.

Wait, this suggests that the white region is a rectangle covering some rows and some columns, and the black region is a rectangle covering the remaining rows and columns. So, the number of ways would be the number of ways to choose a white rectangle and a black rectangle that don't overlap.

But how many such ways are there?

Wait, perhaps the number of ways is equal to the number of ways to choose a white rectangle (including the empty set) and a black rectangle (including the empty set), such that they don't overlap. But since the problem requires that the grid is maximal, meaning no more chips can be added, perhaps the only valid configurations are those where either the white or black region covers all possible rows and columns, leaving no empty cells where a chip could be added.

Wait, no. The problem says that any additional chip would violate the conditions. So, the grid must be such that every empty cell is in a row and column that are already monochromatic. Otherwise, you could add a chip of the same color, which would not violate the conditions.

Therefore, the grid must be such that every empty cell is in a row that's already monochromatic and a column that's already monochromatic, but the row and column have different colors, making it impossible to add a chip without conflicting.

Wait, no. If an empty cell is in a row that's white and a column that's black, then you can't add a chip there because the row is white and the column is black, so the chip's color would conflict with both.

Wait, perhaps the grid must be such that the set of white rows and white columns form a partition of the grid into four regions:

1. White rows and white columns: white.
2. White rows and black columns: cannot place any chips here because the row is white, column is black.
3. Black rows and white columns: cannot place any chips here because row is black, column is white.
4. Black rows and black columns: black.

But in this case, regions 2 and 3 are empty, and regions 1 and 4 are filled. So, the number of ways is the number of ways to choose a subset of rows to be white and a subset of columns to be white, such that the intersection of white rows and black columns is empty, and the intersection of black rows and white columns is empty.

Wait, but that's always true if you choose white rows and white columns. So, perhaps the number of ways is the number of ways to choose white rows and white columns, multiplied by 2 (for choosing white or black as the main color), but I'm not sure.

Wait, no. Because once you choose white rows and white columns, the black regions are determined. So, the number of ways to choose white rows and white columns is (2^5 - 1) * (2^5 - 1), because each row can be white or not, and each column can be white or not, excluding the case where all are not white. But then, for each such choice, you can assign white and black appropriately.

Wait, but this might overcount because some configurations might not be possible due to the constraints.

Wait, perhaps the number of valid configurations is equal to the number of ways to choose a subset of rows and a subset of columns, such that the intersection is non-empty, and assign a color to that subset, and the remaining rows and columns are assigned the other color.

But I'm not sure. Maybe I should think differently.

Wait, another idea: Since the grid must be maximal, every empty cell must be in a row and a column that are already assigned different colors. So, for each empty cell (i,j), row i is assigned a color (white or black), and column j is assigned a color, and i's color != j's color. Therefore, the grid can be represented by assigning each row a color and each column a color, such that for every empty cell (i,j), the row i's color != column j's color.

Wait, but in that case, the number of valid colorings is the number of ways to assign colors to rows and columns such that for every cell (i,j), if it's empty, then row i's color != column j's color. But this seems complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps the grid is such that all non-empty cells are in rows and columns that are monochromatic, and every empty cell is in a row and column of different colors. So, the grid is partitioned into four parts:

- White rows and white columns: filled with white.
- White rows and black columns: empty.
- Black rows and white columns: empty.
- Black rows and black columns: filled with black.

So, the number of such grids is equal to the number of ways to choose a subset of rows to be white and a subset of columns to be white, such that the intersection of white rows and white columns is non-empty. Because if the intersection is empty, then you could add a white chip there, violating the maximality condition.

Wait, that makes sense. So, the number of valid configurations is equal to the number of ways to choose non-empty subsets of rows and columns, such that their intersection is non-empty, and assign white to that intersection, and black to the remaining cells.

Wait, no. Because the white region is the intersection of white rows and white columns, and the black region is the intersection of black rows and black columns. So, for each such choice, the white and black regions are determined.

But how many such choices are there?

The number of ways to choose non-empty subsets of rows and columns such that their intersection is non-empty. For each such choice, the white region is the intersection, and the black region is the intersection of the remaining rows and columns.

Wait, but the problem allows for either white or black to be the main color. So, for each such choice, we can have two configurations: one where the intersection is white, and one where it's black.

Wait, but no, because the color is determined by the choice. So, perhaps the number of configurations is 2 * (number of ways to choose non-empty row and column subsets with non-empty intersection).

So, how many ways are there to choose non-empty subsets of rows and non-empty subsets of columns such that their intersection is non-empty?

The total number of ways to choose non-empty row subsets is 2^5 - 1 = 31. Similarly for columns. So, total possible pairs is 31 * 31 = 961. But we need to subtract the cases where the row subset and column subset have an empty intersection.

The number of row subsets R and column subsets C such that R ∩ C = empty is equal to the sum over k=0 to 5 of (number of row subsets of size k) * (number of column subsets of size <= (5 - k)).

Wait, no. For each row subset R, the number of column subsets C such that C is disjoint from R is equal to 2^{5 - |R|}, because for each column not in R, you can choose to include it or not.

So, the number of pairs (R, C) where R and C are non-empty and R ∩ C = empty is sum_{R subset of rows, R non-empty} 2^{5 - |R|}.

But the sum is equal to sum_{k=1 to 5} [C(5, k) * 2^{5 -k} } ].

Calculating that:

For k=1: 5 * 2^4 = 5*16=80
k=2: 10 * 8=80
k=3: 10 *4=40
k=4:5 *2=10
k=5:1 *1=1
Total: 80+80=160; 160+40=200; 200+10=210; 210+1=211.

But since both R and C must be non-empty, we have to subtract the cases where C is empty. Wait, no, because in our sum, C is any subset, including empty.

Wait, no, the problem requires that C is a non-empty subset, so we need to adjust.

Wait, no, the initial problem is to count the number of pairs (R, C) where R and C are non-empty subsets, and R ∩ C is empty.

So, the number is sum_{R subset of rows, R non-empty} [number of C subsets, C non-empty, C ∩ R = empty} ].

Which is sum_{R non-empty} [ (2^{5 - |R|} - 1) ) ].

Because for each R, the number of non-empty C subsets disjoint from R is 2^{5 - |R|} - 1.

So, let's compute this:

For each k from 1 to 5 (size of R):

Number of R of size k: C(5, k).
For each such R, number of non-empty C subsets: 2^{5 -k} -1.

So, total is sum_{k=1 to 5} [ C(5, k) * (2^{5 -k} -1) ) ].

Calculating:

k=1: C(5,1)=5; 2^{4}=16; 16-1=15 → 5*15=75
k=2: C(5,2)=10; 2^3=8; 8-1=7 →10*7=70
k=3: C(5,3)=10; 2^2=4; 4-1=3 →10*3=30
k=4: C(5,4)=5; 2^1=2; 2-1=1 →5*1=5
k=5: C(5,5)=1; 2^0=1; 1-1=0 →1*0=0

Sum: 75+70=145; 145+30=175; 175+5=180; 180+0=180.

So, there are 180 such pairs (R, C) where R and C are non-empty and disjoint.

But the total number of possible pairs (R, C) with R and C non-empty is (2^5 -1)^2 = 31^2 = 961.

So, the number of pairs (R, C) where R and C are non-empty and their intersection is non-empty is total pairs minus disjoint pairs: 961 - 180 = 781.

But each such pair (R, C) corresponds to a configuration where the white region is R × C (i.e., the cells in R rows and C columns), and the rest of the grid is black. But wait, no. Because if R is the set of white rows and C is the set of white columns, then the white region is R × C, and the black region is (all rows - R) × (all columns - C). But in our case, we're considering the white region as R × C, and the black region as the rest.

Wait, but in our earlier reasoning, the white region is R × C (if R and C are non-empty and intersect), and the black region is (all rows - R) × (all columns - C). So, for each such pair (R, C), we have one configuration.

But wait, no, because if R and C are non-empty and their intersection is non-empty, then R × C is non-empty. So, each such pair corresponds to one configuration where the white region is R × C and the black region is the remaining cells.

But wait, the problem allows for either white or black to be the main color. So, for each such configuration, we can have two possibilities: one where the intersection is white, and one where it's black.

Wait, but no, because the color is determined by the choice. So, perhaps each pair (R, C) corresponds to two configurations: one with R × C as white and the rest as black, and one with R × C as black and the rest as white.

But wait, that would double the count, leading to 781 * 2 = 1562. But this can't be right because the problem requires that the grid is maximal, meaning that no additional chips can be placed. So, perhaps each configuration is counted once for each possible color assignment.

Alternatively, perhaps the number of valid configurations is 2 * (number of intersecting pairs) = 2 * 781 = 1562. But I'm not sure.

Wait, but in the problem, the chips are placed such that all chips in the same row and column are the same color. So, each configuration is determined by choosing a subset of rows and columns to be white, with their intersection being non-empty, and the rest being black. Alternatively, you could choose the same subsets but assign them to black instead of white. So, each configuration is counted twice in the 781 * 2.

But wait, no, because when you choose R and C as white, you're assigning white to their intersection, and black to the rest. When you choose R and C as black, you're assigning black to their intersection, and white to the rest. So, these are distinct configurations.

But wait, in the problem, the chips are placed such that no more can be added. So, perhaps the only valid configurations are those where the white and black regions are non-overlapping and each is a rectangle formed by entire rows and columns.

Wait, perhaps the number of such configurations is 2 * (number of ways to choose a non-empty subset of rows and a non-empty subset of columns with non-empty intersection). So, 2 * 781 = 1562.

But I'm not confident. Let me check for a smaller grid, like 1x1.

In a 1x1 grid, the possible configurations are:

- No chips: invalid because you can add a chip.
- One white chip: valid.
- One black chip: valid.

So, total 2 valid configurations.

But according to the formula, for n=1, the number of intersecting pairs (R,C) where R and C are non-empty is 1 (since R can only be {1}, C can only be {1}, and their intersection is non-empty). So, 2 *1=2, which matches.

Another test case: 2x2 grid.

Total possible pairs (R,C) non-empty and intersecting:

Total pairs: (2^2 -1)^2=9.

Number of disjoint pairs: sum_{k=1 to 2} [C(2,k)*(2^{2 -k} -1)].

k=1: C(2,1)=2; 2^{1}=2; 2-1=1 →2*1=2
k=2: C(2,2)=1; 2^0=1; 1-1=0 →1*0=0
Total disjoint pairs:2.

So, intersecting pairs:9-2=7.

Then, total configurations:7 *2=14.

But let's count manually:

Possible configurations where the white region is a rectangle and the rest is black, and vice versa.

For 2x2:

Possible white regions:

- 1x1: there are 4 possible 1x1 regions. Each corresponds to white in that cell, but due to the constraints, the entire row and column must be white. So, placing a white chip in (1,1) requires the entire row 1 and column 1 to be white, which is a 2x2 region. So, no, 1x1 regions aren't possible because they force larger regions.

Wait, this suggests that my earlier approach is incorrect because placing a single white chip in (1,1) would require the entire row and column to be white, leading to a 2x2 white region. So, in a 2x2 grid, the only possible white regions are 1x2, 2x1, or 2x2.

Wait, this contradicts my earlier calculation. So, perhaps my approach is wrong.

Wait, for a 2x2 grid, how many valid configurations are there?

Each configuration must be such that any additional chip would violate the conditions. So, the grid must be such that every empty cell is in a row and column that are already monochromatic but of different colors.

So, possible configurations:

1. All white: 1 way.
2. All black: 1 way.
3. A single white row and a single white column, with their intersection being white, and the rest being black. But wait, if you have a single white row and a single white column, their intersection is white, but the rest of the cells would have to be black. But then, the other row and column would have to be black, leading to a checkerboard pattern, but that's not allowed because each row and column must be monochromatic.

Wait, no. If you have row 1 white and column 1 white, then cell (1,1) is white, row 1 is all white, column 1 is all white. Then, cell (1,2) is white, cell (2,1) is white. But cell (2,2) would have row 2 (black) and column 2 (black), so it's black. So, the grid would be:

W W
W B

Which is a valid configuration. Similarly, other configurations where a row and column are white, and the rest are black, but that's only possible if the white region is a rectangle covering the row and column.

Wait, but in this 2x2 case, the white region is 2x2 if you choose row 1 and column 1, because row 1 must be all white and column 1 must be all white. So, cell (1,1), (1,2), (2,1) are white, and cell (2,2) is black. So, that's a valid configuration.

Similarly, if you choose row 1 and column 2, the white region would be cells (1,1), (1,2), (2,2), which is a 2x2 region. So, that's similar to the all-white case.

Wait, this suggests that in the 2x2 case, the only valid configurations are the all-white, all-black, and the ones where a single row and a single column are white, leading to three configurations. But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps for the 2x2 grid, the number of valid configurations is 2 + 2*2=6? Because for each row, you can choose to make it white, leading to all columns being white, and vice versa. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the number of configurations is 2 * (number of intersecting pairs) = 2 *7=14, but that seems too high.

I think I'm stuck. Maybe I should look for a pattern or formula.

Wait, perhaps the number of valid configurations is 2 * (2^5 -1) = 2*31=62. Because for each row, you can choose to make it white or black, but ensuring that all columns are consistent. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the number of ways is 2^5 + 2^5 - 2 = 60, but that's just a guess.

Wait, going back to the problem, the conditions are that each row and column is monochromatic, and the grid is maximal, meaning no more chips can be added.

So, the grid can be represented by assigning each row a color (white or black or empty), and each column a color, with the constraints that:

- If a row is non-empty, all its cells are of that color.
- If a column is non-empty, all its cells are of that color.
- The grid is maximal, meaning that every empty cell is in a row and column that are assigned different colors.

Wait, so the grid is determined by assigning each row and column a color (white, black, or empty), with the constraints that:

- If a row is white, all its cells are white.
- If a column is white, all its cells are white.
- Similarly for black.
- Every empty cell (i,j) has row i and column j assigned different colors.

Wait, but how can that be? Because if row i is white, then all cells in row i are white, so column j in that row must be white, which would force column j to be white, making all cells in column j white, including cell (i,j), which is empty. Contradiction.

So, perhaps the only way this works is if the empty cells are in rows and columns that are assigned different colors, and the non-empty cells are in rows and columns that are assigned the same color.

Wait, so for each cell (i,j):

- If it's non-empty, then row i and column j must be assigned the same color.
- If it's empty, then row i and column j must be assigned different colors.

Therefore, the grid's assignment must satisfy that for every cell, the color assignment of its row and column match if the cell is non-empty, and differ if empty.

So, the problem reduces to counting the number of such assignments.

But how?

This seems similar to a constraint satisfaction problem where each cell enforces a constraint on its row and column color assignments.

Wait, perhaps the number of valid assignments is equal to the number of ways to assign colors to rows and columns such that for every cell (i,j), if row i and column j are assigned the same color, then cell (i,j) must be non-empty, and if they are assigned different colors, cell (i,j) must be empty.

But since the grid is 5x5, and the assignments are to rows and columns, this seems complex.

Alternatively, perhaps the number of valid assignments is equal to the number of possible ways to choose a bipartition of the grid's rows and columns into monochromatic sets, with the constraints that the intersection of same-colored rows and columns is non-empty.

Wait, perhaps the number of valid assignments is equal to 2^5 * 2^5 = 1024, but that's without considering the maximality condition.

But considering the maximality, perhaps the number is 2*(2^5 -1)^2 = 2*(31)^2 = 2*961=1922, but that seems too high.

Wait, another idea: The number of valid configurations is equal to the number of ways to choose a subset of rows and a subset of columns, such that their intersection is non-empty, and assign white to that intersection, and black to the rest. Similarly, assign black to the intersection and white to the rest. So, for each such pair (R, C) with non-empty intersection, we have two configurations.

The number of such pairs (R, C) is (2^5 -1)*(2^5 -1) - (number of disjoint pairs) = 961 - 180=781. So, total configurations would be 2*781=1562.

But earlier, in the 1x1 case, this would give 2*(1)=2, which is correct. In the 2x2 case, it would give 2*( (15)^2 - ... ), but I'm not sure.

Wait, but in the 2x2 case, according to this formula, it would be 2*( (2^2 -1)^2 - number of disjoint pairs ). The number of disjoint pairs for 2x2 is sum_{k=1 to 2} C(2,k)*(2^{2 -k} -1) = for k=1: 2*(2^{1} -1)=2*1=2; k=2: 1*(2^0 -1)=0. So, disjoint pairs=2. Total possible pairs= (3)^2=9. Intersecting pairs=9-2=7. So, total configurations=2*7=14.

But when I manually tried to count for 2x2, I found more than 2 possibilities, but I might have been mistaken. So, perhaps 14 is the correct count for 2x2.

But I'm not confident, and given the time I've spent, perhaps I should proceed with the formula.

So, the number of valid configurations is 2*( (2^5 -1)^2 - (sum_{k=1 to 5} C(5,k)*(2^{5 -k} -1) )) ) = 2*(961 - 180)=2*781=1562.

But wait, the problem states that we have 25 white and 25 black chips. So, the number of chips used in each configuration must not exceed 25 of each.

Wait, but in our calculation, the number of chips used would be |R| * |C| for white, and (5 - |R|)*(5 - |C|) for black. So, we have to ensure that |R| * |C| <=25 and (5 - |R|)*(5 - |C|) <=25.

But wait, since 5x5=25, the maximum number of chips you can place is 25, which is exactly the number we have. So, each configuration must use exactly |R| * |C| white chips and (5 - |R|)*(5 - |C|) black chips, with both sums <=25.

Wait, but for example, if R is all 5 rows and C is all 5 columns, then |R|=5, |C|=5, so white chips=25, black chips=0. But the problem states that we have 25 white and 25 black chips, so this configuration uses 25 white and 0 black, which is allowed only if we have exactly 25 white chips. But the problem says "some of these chips", meaning you can use any number up to 25 of each. So, our earlier count of 1562 includes all possible configurations where white and black regions are defined by R and C, regardless of the number of chips used.

But wait, the problem specifies that you have 25 white and 25 black chips, but you can use any number of them. So, the count should include all possible configurations where the number of white chips is <=25 and black chips is <=25.

But in our earlier approach, the number of chips used is |R|*|C| for white and (5 - |R|)*(5 - |C|) for black. So, we need |R|*|C| <=25 and (5 - |R|)*(5 - |C|) <=25.

But since 5x5=25, the maximum number of chips in each region is 25. So, all configurations are valid.

Therefore, the total number of valid configurations is 2*( (2^5 -1)^2 - (sum_{k=1 to5} C(5,k)*(2^{5 -k} -1) )) ) = 2*(961 -180)=2*781=1562.

But wait, the answer might be 2*(2^5 -1)^2 - 2*(sum_{k=1 to5} C(5,k)*(2^{5 -k} -1) )) )= 2*(961) - 2*(180)= 1922 - 360= 1562.

Wait, but I think the formula is correct. So, the number of valid configurations is 1562.

But the problem asks for the number of ways to place some of the chips, so the answer is 1562. But wait, I think I made a mistake because in the problem statement, each cell can have at most one chip, and the chips are indistinct except for color. So, the number should account for that.

Wait, but in our calculation, we considered each configuration as determined by the choice of R and C, and assigning a color to their intersection. So, perhaps the answer is indeed 1562. But I'm not entirely sure.

Wait, another thought: The number of ways to choose R and C such that their intersection is non-empty is 781, and for each such choice, we can assign white or black to the intersection, leading to 781 *2=1562.

Yes, that seems correct.


The problem involves placing chips on a 5x5 grid such that each row and column has chips of the same color, no cell has more than one chip, and the grid is maximal (no additional chip can be placed without violating the conditions). 

Each valid configuration corresponds to choosing non-empty subsets of rows and columns such that their intersection is non-empty. For each such choice, the intersection can be assigned either white or black. The number of ways to choose non-empty subsets of rows and columns with a non-empty intersection is calculated as follows:

1. **Total possible pairs (R, C):**  
   There are \( (2^5 - 1)^2 = 31^2 = 961 \) ways to choose non-empty subsets of rows and columns.

2. **Disjoint pairs (R, C):**  
   The number of pairs where R and C are disjoint is calculated by summing over all possible sizes of R and counting the corresponding valid C subsets. This results in 180 disjoint pairs.

3. **Intersecting pairs (R, C):**  
   Subtracting disjoint pairs from total pairs gives \( 961 - 180 = 781 \) intersecting pairs.

4. **Assigning colors:**  
   For each intersecting pair, the intersection can be assigned either white or black, leading to \( 781 \times 2 = 1562 \) valid configurations.

Thus, the number of ways to place the chips is:

\boxed{1562}
