Okay, so I've got this problem about a convex equilateral hexagon ABCDEF. All pairs of opposite sides are parallel. The triangle formed by extending AB, CD, and EF has sides of lengths 200, 240, and 300. I need to find the side length of the hexagon.

Hmm, let me start by visualizing this. An equilateral hexagon has all sides equal, but it's not necessarily regular because the angles can vary. However, in this case, all opposite sides are parallel. So, opposite sides are both equal in length (since it's equilateral) and parallel, which probably gives the hexagon some symmetry.

The triangle formed by extending AB, CD, and EF. So, if I extend these sides, they meet to form a triangle. The sides of this triangle have lengths 200, 240, and 300. That must mean that each of these sides is the extension of one of those segments. So, if I imagine the hexagon inside this larger triangle, the hexagon is kind of a truncated version of the triangle.

Since all opposite sides of the hexagon are parallel, the hexagon is what's called a "zonogon," but more specifically, since it's convex and equilateral with opposite sides parallel, it's a special case. Maybe it's similar to a regular hexagon but stretched or scaled in some way.

I remember that in such cases, the hexagon can be thought of as being formed by cutting off smaller triangles from the corners of the larger triangle. Each of these cuts would create sides of the hexagon. Since the hexagon is equilateral, all those sides are the same length, say 's'.

So, the triangle sides are 200, 240, 300. Let me denote the triangle as T with sides 200, 240, 300. The hexagon is inside T, and its sides are created by cutting off small triangles from T.

Wait, but how exactly are the sides of the hexagon related to the sides of triangle T?

Let me think. Each side of the hexagon is parallel and a portion of the extension of the sides of T. For example, AB is extended to meet other sides, but since AB is a side of the hexagon, it's part of the extension that forms the triangle T. So, each side of the hexagon is a portion of the sides of T, but shorter by some proportion.

I think I need to use similar triangles here. Because when you extend the sides of the hexagon, they form triangle T, and the hexagon itself can be seen as a scaled-down version of T.

But the hexagon has six sides, all equal, and opposite sides are parallel. So, the hexagon is like a centrally symmetric figure inside the triangle.

Wait, maybe I can model the hexagon as a combination of three pairs of parallel lines, each pair corresponding to the sides of the triangle.

Let me try to think of the triangle T as the outer triangle, and the hexagon is inside it. Each pair of opposite sides of the hexagon is parallel to a side of T.

So, for example, AB and DE are both parallel to the side of length 200 in T, BC and EF are parallel to the side of length 240, and CD and FA are parallel to the side of length 300.

Wait, but the problem says all pairs of opposite sides are parallel, so that makes sense. So, each pair of opposite sides of the hexagon is parallel to a side of the triangle T.

Since the hexagon is equilateral, all its sides are length 's', but the distances from each pair of opposite sides to the corresponding side of T would be proportional.

Wait, perhaps it's better to model this with coordinates.

Let me assign coordinates to the triangle T. Let me place T such that one vertex is at the origin, and the sides are along the axes. Wait, but T is a scalene triangle with sides 200, 240, 300. Let me check if it's a right triangle.

Wait, 200² + 240² = 40000
