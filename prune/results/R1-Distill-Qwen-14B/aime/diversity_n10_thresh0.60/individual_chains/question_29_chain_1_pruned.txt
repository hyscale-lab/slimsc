Okay, so I have this geometry problem here about two rectangles, ABCD and EFGH. Let me try to visualize it first. The problem says that D, E, C, F are collinear, meaning they all lie on a straight line. Also, points A, D, H, G all lie on a circle. The given lengths are BC = 16, AB = 107, FG = 17, and EF = 184. I need to find the length of CE.

Hmm, let me draw a rough sketch in my mind. So, ABCD is a rectangle. Let me label the points: A is top-left, B is top-right, C is bottom-right, D is bottom-left. So, AB is the top side, BC is the right side, CD is the bottom side, and DA is the left side. Similarly, EFGH is another rectangle. Let me think about their positions.

Since D, E, C, F are collinear, and D is a corner of rectangle ABCD, E must be a point on DC extended beyond C, and F is another point on DC? Wait, no. Wait, D, E, C, F are collinear, so perhaps E is before D, and F is after C on the same line DC. Or maybe E is between D and C, and F is beyond C. Hmm, not sure yet.

Also, points A, D, H, G lie on a circle. That's interesting because if four points lie on a circle, the quadrilateral they form is cyclic. So, quadrilateral ADHG is cyclic. That might be useful later.

Let me note down the given lengths. BC = 16, which is the height of rectangle ABCD. AB = 107, which is the width of ABCD. So, ABCD is a rectangle with sides 107 and 16. So, AD = BC =16, AB = CD =107.

Similarly, for rectangle EFGH, FG =17 and EF=184. So, EF is the length, FG is the width. So, EF =184 is one side, FG=17 is another. So, EF is the top side, FG is the right side, GH is the bottom, HE is the left.

Wait, but the order of the letters is EFGH, so the sides are
