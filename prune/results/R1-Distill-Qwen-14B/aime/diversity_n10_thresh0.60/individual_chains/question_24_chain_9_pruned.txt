Okay, so I need to solve this math problem. Let me read it again and make sure I understand all the parts. The problem is about a list of positive integers with three specific properties. My goal is to find the sum of the squares of all the items in the list. 

The properties are:

1. The sum of the items is 30.
2. The unique mode is 9.
3. The median is a positive integer that does not appear in the list itself.

Alright, let's break this down step by step. 

First, let's recall some definitions to make sure I'm on the right track. The mode of a list of numbers is the number that appears most frequently. A unique mode means that only one number has the highest frequency, and all others appear less often. So, in this case, 9 is the number that appears more times than any other number in the list.

The median is the middle value when the numbers are arranged in order. If there's an even number of elements, the median is the average of the two middle numbers. But the problem states that the median is a positive integer that does not appear in the list itself. So, it must be an integer, which implies that the two middle numbers (if the count is even) must add up to an even number, making their average an integer. Also, since this median isn't in the list, it means that the two middle numbers can't both be the same as the median, but wait, the median is an integer not in the list, so perhaps the two middle numbers are different?

Wait, no. If the median is an integer not present in the list, that suggests that for an even number of elements, the two middle numbers must average to a number that's not in the list. Hmm, so maybe the two middle numbers are both different from the median, but their average is the median. 

But let me think more about the median. The median not appearing in the list is a key point. So, for example, if the list has an odd number of elements, say 2k+1, then the median is the (k+1)th term. For it to not be in the list, that's impossible because the median is an element of the list. Wait, that can't be. So, that suggests that the list must have an even number of elements. Because if it's odd, the median is one of
