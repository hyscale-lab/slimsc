Okay, so I've got this geometry problem here, and I need to find the length of AP in a triangle ABC. The problem says that ABC is inscribed in a circle ω. The tangents at B and C intersect at point D, and then AD intersects ω again at P. The sides are given: AB is 5, BC is 9, and AC is 10. I need to find AP in the form m/n where m and n are coprime, and then give m + n.

First, let me try to visualize the problem. We have triangle ABC with sides 5, 9, 10. So, ABC isn't a right-angled triangle because 5² + 9² is 25 + 81 = 106, which is not equal to 10² = 100. Hmm, okay. So, it's a scalene triangle. The circle ω is the circumcircle of ABC.

Then, the tangents at B and C meet at D. I remember that the point where two tangents meet is called the exsymmedian point or something like that. Wait, no, actually, the exsymmedian relates to the external tangents. But in this case, since we're dealing with tangents at B and C, D is the intersection of the tangents. So, D is the ex-pole of BC or something... Maybe I should recall that the point where two tangents meet is the ex-pole or maybe the symmedian point?

Alternatively, perhaps I should use properties of power of a point. The power of point D with respect to ω is DB² = DC², since both are tangents from D to ω. So, DB = DC.

I think the key here is to relate AD to AP. Since AD passes through the circle again at P, AP is a part of the secant from A through D. So, by the power of point A with respect to ω, we have that AP * AD = power of A with respect to ω. Wait, but A is on ω, so its power is zero. That doesn't help directly.

Wait, maybe I should think about harmonic division or something else. Alternatively, maybe use inversion, but that might be too complicated for now.

Alternatively, maybe use triangle areas or trigonometry. Or perhaps use Menelaus' theorem or Ceva's theorem.

Wait, another approach: since D is the intersection of the tangents at B and C, triangle BDC is the tangential triangle at BC, and D is the ex-pole. So, BD and CD are equal in length because they're both tangents from D to ω.

Wait, so BD = CD. Let's denote BD = CD = x. Then, perhaps I can find x in terms of the sides of the triangle.

Alternatively, maybe use coordinates. Let me try coordinate geometry. Let me place point C at the origin (0,0), point A at (10,0), since AC is 10. Then, point B is somewhere in the plane.

Given AB = 5, BC = 9. So, points: A(10,0), C(0,0). Let me find coordinates of B.

Let me denote B as (x,y). Then, distance from A to B is 5: sqrt( (x-10)^2 + y^2 ) = 5. So, (x-10)^2 + y^2 = 25.

Distance from B to C is 9: sqrt(x^2 + y^2) = 9. So, x² + y² = 81.

So, subtracting the first equation from the second: x² + y² - [ (x-10)^2 + y^2 ] = 81 - 25 => x² - (x² -20x +100) = 56 => 20x - 100 = 56 => 20x = 156 => x = 156/20 = 39/5 = 7.8.

Then, plug x back into x² + y² =81: (39/5)^2 + y² =81. So, (1521/25) + y² = 81. 81 is 2025/25. So, y² = (2025 - 1521)/25 = 504/25. So, y = sqrt(504)/5. Let me compute sqrt(504): 504 = 16*31.5? Wait, 504 = 16 * 31.5? No, 16*31 is 496, so 504 - 496 =8, so 504= 16*31 +8, but that's not helpful. Maybe factor 504: 504 = 72 *7 = 8*9*7. So, sqrt(504) = sqrt(8*9*7) = 2*3*sqrt(14) = 6*sqrt(14). So, y = 6√14 /5.

So, point B is at (39/5, 6√14/5). So, coordinates: A(10,0), B(39/5, 6√14/5), C(0,0).

Now, I need to find the equations of the tangents at B and C to the circle ω. The circle ω is the circumcircle of ABC.

First, let's
