Alright, let's try to tackle this problem. Okay, so Alice chooses a set A of positive integers. Then Bob lists all finite nonempty sets B of positive integers such that the maximum element of B is in A. Bob's list has 2024 sets. We need to find the sum of the elements of A.

Hmm, okay. Let me break this down. So, Bob is creating sets B where each B is a finite nonempty set of positive integers, and importantly, the maximum element of each B is in A. The number of such sets is 2024. We need to find the sum of elements in A.

Wait, so A is a set that Alice chooses, and based on that, Bob lists all possible finite nonempty sets B where the maximum of B is in A. The total number of these sets is 2024. So, we have to figure out what A is such that the number of such B's is 2024, then sum the elements of A.

I remember that if you have a set A, the number of finite nonempty sets B where the maximum element is in A can be calculated in a specific way. Let me think. For each element a in A, the number of sets B where the maximum is a is equal to 2^{a-1}. Because for each a, you can choose any subset of the numbers from 1 to a-1 and then add a as the maximum. So, for each a, the number of such sets is 2^(a-1). 

So, if A has elements a1, a2, ..., an, then the total number of sets B is the sum over each a in A of 2^{a-1}. That is, total sets = sum_{a in A} 2^{a-1}.

Wait, that makes sense. Because for each a, you can include any combination of the numbers less than a, and then a itself must be included as the maximum. So, for each a, there are 2^{a-1} subsets. 

So, in this problem, it's given that the total number of such sets B is 2024. So, sum_{a in A} 2^{a-1} = 2024.

We need to find A such that this sum equals 2024, and then compute the sum of the elements of A.

So, the problem reduces to finding a set A where the sum of 2^{a-1} for each a in A is 2024, and then summing the elements of A.

Hmm, so perhaps A is a set of consecutive integers starting from 1? Or maybe not. Let me think about how to approach this.

Wait, 2024 is the total sum. Let's think of 2024 in binary, because the sum is in powers of 2.

Wait, 2^{a-1} is a power of two. So, the sum is a sum of distinct powers of two? That would make the sum a number whose binary representation corresponds to the set bits at positions (a-1) for each a in A.

But wait, no, because A can have any positive integers, not necessarily consecutive. So, perhaps A is a set where each a is chosen such that the sum of 2^{a-1} equals 2024.

Wait, but if each term is 2^{a-1} for a in A, then each term is a unique power of two. So, the sum is a number expressed as a sum of distinct powers of two. So, 2024 must be expressed as a sum of such terms.

Wait, but 2^{a-1} for a in A: so, for a=1, it's 2^{0}=1; a=2, it's 2^{1}=2; a=3, it's 4; and so on.

So, the sum becomes 1*(if 1 is in A) + 2*(if 2 is in A) + 4*(if 3 is in A) + 8*(if 4 is in A) + ... etc.

So, 2024 can be expressed as the sum of distinct powers of 2. Since 2024 is an integer, we can express it in binary.

Let me compute 2024 in binary.

Compute 2024 divided by 2: 2024 ÷2=1012, remainder 0

1012 ÷2=506, rem 0

506 ÷2=253, rem 0

253 ÷2=126 rem 1

126 ÷2=63 rem 0

63 ÷2=31 rem 1

31 ÷2=15 rem 1

15 ÷2=7 rem 1

7 ÷2=3 rem 1

3 ÷2=1 rem 1

1 ÷2=0 rem 1.

So, writing the remainders from last to first: 11111101000.

Wait, let me count:

2024 /2=1012 rem 0

1012/2=506 rem 0

506/2=253 rem0

253/2=126 rem1

126/2=63 rem0

63/2=31 rem1

31/2=15 rem1

15/2=7 rem1

7/2=3 rem1

3/2=1 rem1

1/2=0 rem1.

So the remainders, from last to first: 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 1 0 0 0.

Wait, so 11 bits. Let's write it as:

1 (2^10) 1 (2^9) 1 (2^8) 1 (2^7) 1 (2^6) 1 (2^5) 0 (2^4) 1 (2^3) 0 (2^2) 0 (2^1) 0 (2^0).

Wait, 2^10 is 1024, 2^11 is 2048, which is more than 2024. So, binary digits are:

11111101000.

Let me compute that:

From right to left, bits are:

bit 10:1, bit9:1, bit8:1, bit7:1, bit6:1, bit5:1, bit4:0, bit3:1, bit2:0, bit1:0, bit0:0.

So, 2^10 + 2^9 + 2^8 + 2^7 + 2^6 + 2^5 + 2^3.

Which is 1024 + 512 + 256 + 128 + 64 +32 +8.

Compute that:

1024 +512=1536,

1536+256=1792,

1792+128=1920,

1920+64=1984,

1984+32=2016,

2016+8=2024. Yes, correct.

So, 2024 in binary is 11111101000, which is 2^10 + 2^9 + 2^8 + 2^7 + 2^6 + 2^5 + 2^3.

So, each set bit in 2024's binary representation corresponds to a 2^{k} in the sum.

But in our problem, the sum is sum_{a in A} 2^{a-1} = 2024.

So, each bit set in 2024's binary representation corresponds to a term 2^{a-1} in the sum. So, each 2^{a-1} is a set bit, so the exponents must correspond.

Wait, the exponents in 2024's binary are 10,9,8,7,6,5,3.

So, that would mean that a-1=10,9,8,7,6,5,3.

So, a=11,10,9,8,7,6,4.

Wait, because a-1 is the exponent, so a is exponent +1.

So, the exponents are 10,9,8,7,6,5,3. So, a is 11,10,9,8,7,6,4.

So, A = {4,6,7,8,9,10,11}.

Wait, but let's check that.

Compute sum_{a in A} 2^{a-1}:

4: 2^3=8

6:2^5=32

7:2^6=64

8:2^7=128

9:2^8=256

10:2^9=512

11:2^{10}=1024

Sum: 8+32=40; 40+64=104; 104+128=232; 232+256=488; 488+512=1000; 1000+1024=2024. Yes, correct.

So, A is {4,6,7,8,9,10,11}.

Now, we need to find the sum of the elements of A.

Compute 4+6=10; 10+7=17; 17+8=25; 25+9=34; 34+10=44; 44+11=55.

Wait, 4+6 is 10, plus 7 is 17, plus 8 is 25, plus 9 is 34, plus 10 is 44, plus 11 is 55.

So, the sum is 55.

Wait, but let me check again the elements of A: 4,6,7,8,9,10,11.

Sum: 4+6=10, 10+7=17, +8=25, +9=34, +10=44, +11=55. Yes.

So, the answer should be 55.

But let me think again: could there be another set A that gives the same sum 2024? Because maybe 2024 can be expressed as a sum of other 2^{a-1} terms, not necessarily corresponding directly to the binary digits.

Wait, but 2^{a-1} are powers of two, and each is unique. So, any sum of distinct 2^{a-1} terms is unique and corresponds to the binary representation.

Therefore, the only possible A is the one where a-1 are the exponents in the binary representation of 2024, which are 10,9,8,7,6,5,3.

Thus, a's are 11,10,9,8,7,6,4.

So, A is {4,6,7,8,9,10,11}, sum is 55.


Alice chooses a set \( A \) of positive integers. Bob then lists all finite nonempty sets \( B \) of positive integers where the maximum element of \( B \) belongs to \( A \). The total number of such sets \( B \) is given as 2024. To find the sum of the elements of \( A \), we note that for each \( a \in A \), the number of sets \( B \) with maximum \( a \) is \( 2^{a-1} \). Thus, the total number of sets is the sum \( \sum_{a \in A} 2^{a-1} = 2024 \).

Expressing 2024 in binary gives \( 11111101000_2 \), which corresponds to the sum \( 2^{10} + 2^9 + 2^8 + 2^7 + 2^6 + 2^5 + 2^3 \). Therefore, the exponents \( a-1 \) are 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, and 3, leading to \( a = 11, 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 4 \). Hence, \( A = \{4, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11\} \).

The sum of the elements of \( A \) is \( 4 + 6 + 7 + 8 + 9 + 10 + 11 = 55 \).

\(\boxed{55}\)
