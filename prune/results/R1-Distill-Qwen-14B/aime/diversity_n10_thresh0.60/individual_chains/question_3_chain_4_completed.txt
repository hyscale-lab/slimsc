Okay, so I have this probability problem to solve. Let me read it again and try to understand what’s being asked.

Jen is entering a lottery by picking 4 distinct numbers from the set S = {1,2,3,...,10}. Then, 4 numbers are randomly chosen from S. She wins a prize if at least two of her numbers match two of the randomly chosen numbers. She wins the grand prize if all four of her numbers are the ones chosen. The question is about finding the probability that she wins the grand prize given that she won a prize. The answer needs to be expressed as a fraction m/n where m and n are coprime, and then find m + n.

Hmm. So this is a conditional probability problem. I remember that conditional probability is the probability of an event A given that event B has occurred, which is P(A|B) = P(A ∩ B) / P(B). In this case, event A is Jen winning the grand prize, and event B is her winning a prize. So I need to find P(A|B) = P(A and B) / P(B).

But wait, if she wins the grand prize, then she automatically wins a prize, right? Because winning the grand prize is a subset of winning a prize. So P(A ∩ B) is just P(A). So the formula simplifies to P(A|B) = P(A) / P(B).

So now I need to compute two probabilities: the probability of winning the grand prize (P(A)) and the probability of winning a prize (P(B)). Then divide them.

Let me structure this.

First, the total number of ways to choose 4 numbers from 10 is C(10,4). That's the denominator for both probabilities.

Calculating C(10,4): 10! / (4! * (10-4)!) = (10 * 9 * 8 * 7) / (4 * 3 * 2 * 1) = 210. So total possible combinations are 210.

Now, P(A), the probability of winning the grand prize. That's when all four of Jen's numbers are chosen. Since she picks 4 distinct numbers, and the lottery also draws 4, the number of favorable outcomes is 1 (only her specific set). So P(A) = 1 / 210.

Next, P(B), the probability of winning a prize. Winning a prize means that at least two of her numbers are among the four chosen. So, that can be calculated as 1 minus the probability of having fewer than two matches, i.e., zero or one matches.

Alternatively, sometimes it's easier to compute the favorable cases directly. Let's see.

Number of ways to have exactly k matches, for k=2,3,4.

Wait, but since she could have 2, 3, or 4 matches. So the total number of favorable cases for B is the sum of the number of ways she can have exactly 2, 3, or 4 matches.

Let me compute each:

- Exactly 4 matches: That's the grand prize case. Only 1 way.

- Exactly 3 matches: We need to choose 3 numbers from her 4, and 1 number from the remaining 6 (since 10 - 4 = 6). So the number of ways is C(4,3) * C(6,1).

C(4,3) is 4, and C(6,1) is 6, so 4 * 6 = 24.

- Exactly 2 matches: Choose 2 from her 4, and 2 from the remaining 6. So C(4,2) * C(6,2).

C(4,2) is 6, and C(6,2) is 15. So 6 * 15 = 90.

Adding them up: 1 (for 4) + 24 (for 3) + 90 (for 2) = 115.

So the number of favorable outcomes for B is 115. Therefore, P(B) = 115 / 210.

Wait a second, let me confirm this. Is the number of favorable cases 115?

Wait, another approach: The total number of ways the lottery can choose 4 numbers is 210. The number of ways where at least two of Jen's numbers are chosen is equal to the number of 4-number combinations that include at least two of her 4 numbers.

Alternatively, the number of such combinations can be calculated as the sum from k=2 to 4 of C(4,k)*C(6,4−k). Wait, that might be another way. Let me see.

Wait, when choosing 4 numbers, with exactly k of them being from Jen's 4 numbers, and the rest from the other 6.

So the number of ways for exactly k matches is C(4,k) * C(6,4−k).

So for k=2: C(4,2)*C(6,2) = 6 * 15 = 90.

k=3: C(4,3)*C(6,1)=4*6=24.

k=4: C(4,4)*C(6,0)=1*1=1.

So total is 90+24+1=115, which matches what I had earlier. So yes, 115 is correct.

Therefore, P(B) = 115 / 210.

Simplify that: 115 and 210 are both divisible by 5. 115 ÷5=23, 210 ÷5=42. So 23/42 is P(B).

Wait, 23 and 42 have no common factors, so that's reduced.

So P(B)=23/42.

Earlier, P(A) is 1/210.

So now, P(A|B) is P(A)/P(B) = (1/210) / (23/42) = (1/210) * (42/23) = (42)/(210*23) = simplifying.

42 divides into 210 exactly 5 times, because 42 *5=210.

So 42/210 = 1/5.

So, 42/(210*23) = (1/5)/23 = 1/(5*23) = 1/115.

Wait, let me recheck the calculation:

(1/210) divided by (23/42) equals (1/210) multiplied by (42/23).

Which is (42)/(210 *23).

42/210 = 1/5, so 1/(5 *23) = 1/115.

So P(A|B) = 1/115.

So m=1, n=115. Are they coprime? Yes, since 115 is 5*23, and 1 shares no common factors besides 1.

Therefore, m + n = 1 + 115 = 116.

Wait, but let me think again. Did I calculate correctly?

Wait, 42/210 is 1/5. So 42/(210 *23) = (1/5) /23 = 1/(115). That's correct.

Yes, that's right. So the probability is 1/115, so m + n is 116.

Alternatively, perhaps I can think of it as the number of ways winning the grand prize over the number of ways winning any prize.

Since P(A|B) is the number of grand prize cases divided by the number of prize cases.

Which would be 1 (grand prize) divided by 115 (prize cases). So 1/115. That's the same result.

So, yeah, I think that's correct.


Jen enters a lottery by selecting 4 distinct numbers from the set \( S = \{1, 2, 3, \ldots, 10\} \). The probability of winning the grand prize given that she won a prize is calculated using conditional probability.

First, compute the total number of ways to choose 4 numbers from 10:
\[
\binom{10}{4} = 210
\]

The probability of winning the grand prize (\( P(A) \)) is:
\[
P(A) = \frac{1}{210}
\]

Next, calculate the probability of winning a prize (\( P(B) \)), which occurs if at least two of Jen's numbers match the chosen numbers. This is the sum of the probabilities of having exactly 2, 3, or 4 matches:
\[
\text{Number of ways for exactly 2 matches} = \binom{4}{2} \binom{6}{2} = 6 \times 15 = 90
\]
\[
\text{Number of ways for exactly 3 matches} = \binom{4}{3} \binom{6}{1} = 4 \times 6 = 24
\]
\[
\text{Number of ways for exactly 4 matches} = \binom{4}{4} \binom{6}{0} = 1 \times 1 = 1
\]
\[
\text{Total number of favorable outcomes} = 90 + 24 + 1 = 115
\]
\[
P(B) = \frac{115}{210} = \frac{23}{42}
\]

The conditional probability \( P(A|B) \) is:
\[
P(A|B) = \frac{P(A)}{P(B)} = \frac{\frac{1}{210}}{\frac{23}{42}} = \frac{1}{210} \times \frac{42}{23} = \frac{1}{115}
\]

Thus, \( m = 1 \) and \( n = 115 \), and their sum is:
\[
m + n = 1 + 115 = 116
\]

\boxed{116}
