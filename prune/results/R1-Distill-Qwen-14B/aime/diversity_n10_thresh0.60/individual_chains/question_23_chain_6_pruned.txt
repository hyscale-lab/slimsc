Okay, so I've got this problem here about a hyperbola and a rhombus. Let me try to understand it step by step.

The hyperbola is given by the equation x²/20 - y²/24 = 1. Hmm, that's a standard hyperbola centered at the origin, opening left and right. The transverse axis is along the x-axis because the positive term is with x². The a² is 20, so a = sqrt(20) = 2*sqrt(5), and b² is 24, so b = 2*sqrt(6). The asymptotes would be y = (b/a)x, which is y = (2√6)/(2√5) x = sqrt(6/5) x.

Now, we have four points A, B, C, D on this hyperbola forming a rhombus ABCD. The diagonals of the rhombus intersect at the origin. So, the origin is the midpoint of both diagonals.

In a rhombus, the diagonals bisect each other at right angles? Wait, no, that's a square. In a rhombus, the diagonals bisect each other and the angles, but they aren't necessarily perpendicular unless it's a square. Wait, no, actually, in a rhombus, the diagonals are not necessarily perpendicular, but I think they are... Wait, I'm getting confused.

Wait, no, in a rhombus, the diagonals are not necessarily perpendicular, but in a square, which is a special case
