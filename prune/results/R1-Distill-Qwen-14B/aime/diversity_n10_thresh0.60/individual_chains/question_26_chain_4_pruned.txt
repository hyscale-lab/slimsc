Okay, so I'm trying to solve this geometry problem, and I need to find the length of AP in triangle ABC with some given information. Let me try to digest the problem step by step.

First, the problem says that triangle ABC is inscribed in a circle ω. That means ω is the circumcircle of triangle ABC. Then, the tangents to ω at points B and C intersect at point D. So, D is the intersection point of the two tangents. Then, the line AD intersects ω again at point P, and we need to find the length of AP.

Given sides are AB = 5, BC = 9, and AC = 10. So, ABC has sides of lengths 5, 9, 10. That seems like a scalene triangle. Maybe I can compute some properties of this triangle first, like its circumradius or angles.

Wait, since we have tangents from D to ω at B and C, point D is the ex-pole or something? Or maybe it's related to the Gergonne point or something else? Hmm, not sure. Maybe I should recall that the tangent from a point to a circle is equal in length. So, the lengths from D to B and D to C are equal? Wait, yes, because tangents from a common external point to a circle are equal. So, DB = DC.

So, D lies on the symmedian of the triangle. Or maybe on the A-symmedian? Hmm, not exactly sure. Alternatively, maybe I can find coordinates for all these points using coordinate geometry. Or perhaps using power of a point, harmonic division, or properties of cyclic quadrilaterals.

Let me try to visualize the Asymptote figure. Point C is at the origin, A is at (10, 0), and B is somewhere in the plane. The circumcircle is drawn, and D is the intersection of the tangents at B and C. Then, AD intersects the circumcircle again at P.

I think power of a point might be useful here. Specifically, the power of point D with respect to ω. Since D is the intersection of the tangents at B and C, the power of D is equal to DB² = DC². Also, since AD is a secant that intersects ω at A and P, the power of D
