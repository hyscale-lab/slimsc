Okay, so I've got this math problem here, and I'm going to try to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again:

We need to find the number of triples of nonnegative integers (a, b, c) such that a + b + c = 300 and a²b + a²c + b²a + b²c + c²a + c²b = 6,000,000.

Hmm. Alright, so the problem involves two equations with three variables. I remember that when dealing with equations involving sums and products, sometimes it's helpful to consider symmetric expressions or maybe even try to factor things.

Let me write down the given equations:

1. a + b + c = 300
2. a²b + a²c + b²a + b²c + c²a + c²b = 6,000,000

I notice that the second equation has terms like a²b and a²c. Maybe I can factor those. Let's see:

a²b + a²c = a²(b + c)
Similarly, b²a + b²c = b²(a + c)
And c²a + c²b = c²(a + b)

So if I rewrite the second equation, it becomes:

a²(b + c) + b²(a + c) + c²(a + b) = 6,000,000

Hmm, that looks a bit cleaner. Now, since we know that a + b + c = 300, maybe we can substitute for (b + c), (a + c), and (a + b) in terms of 300 - a, 300 - b, and 300 - c, respectively.

So, let's try that substitution.

First, (b + c) = 300 - a
Similarly, (a + c) = 300 - b
And (a + b) = 300 - c

Substituting these into the equation, we get:

a²(300 - a) + b²(300 - b) + c²(300 - c) = 6,000,000

Let me expand each term:

a² * 300 - a³ + b² * 300 - b³ + c² * 300 - c³ = 6,000,000

So that's 300(a² + b² + c²) - (a³ + b³ + c³) = 6,000,000

Hmm. So now, we have:

300(a² + b² + c²) - (a³ + b³ + c³) = 6,000,000

I wonder if I can find expressions for a² + b² + c² and a³ + b³ + c³ in terms of the known sum a + b + c.

I remember that (a + b + c)^2 = a² + b² + c² + 2(ab + bc + ca). Since a + b + c is 300, then 300² = a² + b² + c² + 2(ab + bc + ca). So:

90,000 = a² + b² + c² + 2(ab + bc + ca)

Let me denote S = a² + b² + c² and P = ab + bc + ca. Then,

90,000 = S + 2P => S = 90,000 - 2P.

Hmm. So if I can express S in terms of P, maybe I can relate it to the other equation.

Looking back at the other equation:

300S - (a³ + b³ + c³) = 6,000,000.

I need to find an expression for a³ + b³ + c³. I think there's a formula for that.

I recall that a³ + b³ + c³ can be expressed in terms of S and P. The formula is:

a³ + b³ + c³ = (a + b + c)^3 - 3(a + b + c)(ab + bc + ca) + 3abc

So, using a + b + c = 300, and P = ab + bc + ca,

a³ + b³ + c³ = 300³ - 3*300*P + 3abc

Calculating 300³: 300 * 300 = 90,000, then 90,000 * 300 = 27,000,000.

So,

a³ + b³ + c³ = 27,000,000 - 900P + 3abc

Alright. Now, plugging S and this expression into the equation:

300S - (a³ + b³ + c³) = 6,000,000

Substituting S = 90,000 - 2P,

300*(90,000 - 2P) - [27,000,000 - 900P + 3abc] = 6,000,000

Let me compute each part step by step.

First, compute 300*(90,000 - 2P):

300 * 90,000 = 27,000,000

300 * (-2P) = -600P

So, 300S = 27,000,000 - 600P

Now, subtract (a³ + b³ + c³):

27,000,000 - 600P - [27,000,000 - 900P + 3abc] = 6,000,000

Let me distribute the negative sign:

27,000,000 - 600P - 27,000,000 + 900P - 3abc = 6,000,000

Simplify:

(27,000,000 - 27,000,000) + (-600P + 900P) - 3abc = 6,000,000

Which becomes:

0 + 300P - 3abc = 6,000,000

So,

300P - 3abc = 6,000,000

I can factor out a 3:

3(100P - abc) = 6,000,000

Divide both sides by 3:

100P - abc = 2,000,000

Hmm, so we have the equation:

100P - abc = 2,000,000

Where P = ab + bc + ca.

So, 100(ab + bc + ca) - abc = 2,000,000

Hmm, that's an equation involving P and abc. Let me write that as:

abc = 100(ab + bc + ca) - 2,000,000

Wait, that might not be the most useful way. Alternatively, perhaps we can write:

abc = 100(ab + bc + ca) - 2,000,000

But that might not be directly helpful. Maybe it's better to express everything in terms of variables.

Alternatively, perhaps we can factor this equation in terms of a, b, c.

Let me think. Since the equation is symmetric in a, b, c, perhaps there's a substitution that can help.

Alternatively, let me define variables x = a, y = b, z = c for simplicity.

So, the equation becomes:

xyz = 100(xy + yz + zx) - 2,000,000

Hmm. That seems a bit messy, but maybe we can rearrange it:

xyz - 100(xy + yz + zx) = -2,000,000

Alternatively, let me factor 100 on the left:

xyz = 100(xy + yz + zx) - 2,000,000

Hmm. Let me see if I can express this differently.

Wait, perhaps factor 100 out:

xyz = 100(xy + yz + zx) - 2,000,000

Hmm, perhaps factor 100 on the RHS:

xyz = 100(xy + yz + zx - 20,000)

Not sure if that helps.

Alternatively, maybe I can write this as xyz - 100xy - 100yz - 100zx = -2,000,000

Hmm, that's a bit more manageable. Maybe add 100^3 to both sides to factor.

Wait, I remember that there's a factoring identity when dealing with terms like xyz - xy - yz - zx. Let me think.

Wait, the identity is: (x - 100)(y - 100)(z - 100) = xyz - 100(xy + yz + zx) + 100^2(x + y + z) - 100^3

Wait, let me compute (x - 100)(y - 100)(z - 100):

First, expand (x - 100)(y - 100):

= xy - 100x - 100y + 10,000

Now multiply by (z - 100):

= (xy - 100x - 100y + 10,000)(z - 100)

= xy*z - 100x*z - 100y*z + 10,000*z - 100xy + 10,000x + 10,000y - 1,000,000

So, (x - 100)(y - 100)(z - 100) = xyz - 100(xy) - 100(xz) - 100(yz) + 10000x + 10000y + 10000z - 1,000,000

Hmm, that seems a bit complicated, but let's compare it to our equation.

Our equation is:

xyz - 100(xy + yz + zx) = -2,000,000

So, if I subtract 100(xy + yz + zx) from xyz, I get -2,000,000.

Looking at the expansion of (x - 100)(y - 100)(z - 100), the first four terms are xyz - 100(xy + yz + zx). The rest are additional terms: +10000x +10000y +10000z -1,000,000.

So, if I write:

(x - 100)(y - 100)(z - 100) = xyz - 100(xy + yz + zx) +10000(x + y + z) -1,000,000

But from our equation, xyz - 100(xy + yz + zx) = -2,000,000.

So, substituting that into the expansion:

(x - 100)(y - 100)(z - 100) = (-2,000,000) + 10000(x + y + z) -1,000,000

Simplify the right side:

-2,000,000 -1,000,000 = -3,000,000

So,

(x - 100)(y - 100)(z - 100) = 10000(x + y + z) - 3,000,000

But wait, we know that a + b + c = 300, so x + y + z = 300.

So, plug that in:

(x - 100)(y - 100)(z - 100) = 10000*300 - 3,000,000

Compute 10000*300: that's 3,000,000.

So,

(x - 100)(y - 100)(z - 100) = 3,000,000 - 3,000,000 = 0

Oh! So, (x - 100)(y - 100)(z - 100) = 0.

Which means that at least one of (x - 100), (y - 100), or (z - 100) must be zero.

In other words, at least one of x, y, z must be equal to 100.

So, either a = 100, or b = 100, or c = 100.

Therefore, the triples (a, b, c) must have at least one of them equal to 100.

So, now, we can split the problem into three cases:

1. a = 100
2. b = 100
3. c = 100

But since the equation is symmetric, the number of solutions for each case should be the same, so we can compute the number for one case and multiply by three, then subtract the overlaps where two variables are 100, and then add back the case where all three are 100.

But wait, let me think: in this problem, since a, b, c are nonnegative integers, and we are looking for triples where at least one is 100, but since the sum a + b + c = 300, if one of them is 100, the other two must sum to 200.

But let me proceed step by step.

Case 1: a = 100.

Then, a = 100, so b + c = 200.

We need to find the number of nonnegative integer solutions (b, c) such that b + c = 200.

The number of solutions is 201 (since b can be 0 to 200, and c is determined as 200 - b).

But wait, in addition to that, we have another condition from the second equation.

Wait a minute, no. Wait, we had already used the second equation to derive that at least one variable must be 100. So, in each case where one variable is 100, the other two must satisfy the equation a + b + c = 300, and the other conditions?

Wait, no, in our initial setup, we had to satisfy both equations. So, by setting a variable to 100, we already satisfy the condition from the second equation, meaning that the other variables can be anything that sum to 200.

Wait, but does that hold? Let me think again.

Wait, no, because when we set a = 100, we derived the equation (x - 100)(y - 100)(z - 100)=0, which is a result of the second equation. So, for the solution to satisfy both equations, at least one variable must be 100. So, when setting a = 100, we still need to make sure that the triple (100, b, c) satisfies the second equation.

Wait a second, but we already used the second equation to conclude that at least one of a, b, c must be 100. So, in that case, the other variables can be any nonnegative integers such that their sum is 200.

But wait, is that necessarily true? Let me check.

Suppose a = 100. Then, the second equation reduces to:

a²b + a²c + b²a + b²c + c²a + c²b = 6,000,000.

Substituting a = 100:

100²b + 100²c + b²*100 + b²c + c²*100 + c²b = 6,000,000.

Simplify each term:

10,000b + 10,000c + 100b² + b²c + 100c² + c²b = 6,000,000.

Hmm, that seems non-trivial. So, just setting a = 100 doesn't automatically satisfy the second equation. So, my earlier conclusion that setting a variable to 100 ensures that the second equation is satisfied may not hold. I think I might have made a mistake earlier.

Wait, no. Let me re-examine.

Earlier, we started with the second equation and transformed it into (x - 100)(y - 100)(z - 100) = 0, which came from the condition that:

(x - 100)(y - 100)(z - 100) = 0

Which is equivalent to saying that one of x, y, z must be 100.

So, that equation is derived from the second equation, given that the first equation is satisfied. So, for any solution (a, b, c) that satisfies both equations, we must have at least one variable equal to 100.

But the reverse isn't necessarily true. Just because one variable is 100, it doesn't automatically satisfy the second equation. So, I need to find all triples where a = 100, and also satisfy the second equation, and similarly for b = 100 and c = 100.

So, in that case, the approach is to consider three cases: a=100, b=100, c=100, and for each case, find the number of solutions where the other two variables satisfy the equations.

But since the equations are symmetric, the number of solutions in each case will be the same, so I can compute it for one case and multiply by 3, then subtract the overlaps where two variables are 100 (since those would be counted twice), and add back the cases where all three are 100 (since those were subtracted too many times).

But before I get into inclusion-exclusion, let me first compute the number of solutions for one case, say a = 100.

Case 1: a = 100.

Then, the first equation becomes b + c = 200.

And the second equation, as I wrote earlier, is:

10,000b + 10,000c + 100b² + b²c + 100c² + c²b = 6,000,000.

Hmm, this is still a bit complicated, but perhaps I can factor or simplify it.

Let me factor out terms where possible.

First, notice that b + c = 200, so c = 200 - b.

Let me substitute c = 200 - b into the equation.

So, substituting c = 200 - b:

10,000b + 10,000(200 - b) + 100b² + b²(200 - b) + 100(200 - b)^2 + (200 - b)^2 b = 6,000,000.

Let me compute each term step by step.

Compute 10,000b + 10,000c:

10,000b + 10,000c = 10,000b + 10,000(200 - b) = 10,000b + 2,000,000 - 10,000b = 2,000,000.

So, the first two terms sum to 2,000,000.

Now, the next term is 100b².

Then, b²c = b²(200 - b) = 200b² - b³.

Then, 100c² = 100(200 - b)^2 = 100*(40,000 - 400b + b²) = 4,000,000 - 40,000b + 100b².

Then, c²b = (200 - b)^2 * b = (40,000 - 400b + b²)*b = 40,000b - 400b² + b³.

Putting all these together:

Total equation:

2,000,000 + 100b² + (200b² - b³) + (4,000,000 - 40,000b + 100b²) + (40,000b - 400b² + b³) = 6,000,000.

Let me combine like terms step by step.

First, constants:

2,000,000 + 4,000,000 = 6,000,000.

Next, terms with b:

-40,000b + 40,000b = 0.

Terms with b²:

100b² + 200b² + 100b² - 400b².

Compute:

100 + 200 + 100 = 400, and 400 - 400 = 0. So, the b² terms cancel out.

Terms with b³:

- b³ + b³ = 0.

So, everything except the constants cancels out, and we have 6,000,000 = 6,000,000.

Wait, that's interesting. So, substituting a = 100 into the second equation leads to an identity, meaning that any b and c such that b + c = 200 will satisfy the second equation.

Wow, so that means that for a = 100, any b and c that sum to 200 will satisfy both equations.

Therefore, the number of solutions in this case is equal to the number of nonnegative integer solutions (b, c) such that b + c = 200, which is 201.

Similarly, for the cases where b = 100 or c = 100, the same reasoning applies. So, each case will have 201 solutions.

So, the total number of solutions without considering overlaps would be 3 * 201 = 603.

But wait, we need to subtract the cases where two variables are 100 because those are counted twice in the above.

So, how many solutions have both a = 100 and b = 100?

If a = 100 and b = 100, then c = 300 - 100 - 100 = 100.

So, the triple is (100, 100, 100).

Similarly, if a = 100 and c = 100, then b = 100. Same for b = 100 and c = 100.

So, the only triple where two variables are 100 is (100, 100, 100), but wait, actually, when two variables are 100, the third is also 100 because 100 + 100 + c = 300 => c = 100.

Therefore, the only triple where two variables are 100 is (100, 100, 100). So, how many such triples are there?

Well, each pair (a and b, a and c, b and c) can be 100, but in each case, it forces the third variable to be 100 as well. So, the only overlapping solution is (100, 100, 100).

So, how many times was (100, 100, 100) counted in the initial 603?

In the initial count, each of the three cases (a=100, b=100, c=100) includes the triple (100, 100, 100). So, it was counted three times.

But in reality, it's a single unique solution. So, to correct the count, we need to subtract the duplicates.

The inclusion-exclusion principle says:

Total = (number with a=100) + (number with b=100) + (number with c=100) - (number with a=100 and b=100) - (number with a=100 and c=100) - (number with b=100 and c=100) + (number with a=100 and b=100 and c=100)).

But in our case, the only case where two variables are 100 is when all three are 100. So, the number with a=100 and b=100 is 1, same for a=100 and c=100, and b=100 and c=100. So, each of those intersections is 1, and the triple intersection is also 1.

So, applying inclusion-exclusion:

Total = 3*201 - 3*1 + 1

Compute that:

3*201 = 603
3*1 = 3
So, 603 - 3 = 600, then +1 = 601.

Wait, but that gives 601, but let's think again.

Wait, no, inclusion-exclusion formula is:

Total = (A + B + C) - (AB + AC + BC) + ABC

Where A is the number with a=100, B with b=100, C with c=100.

So, each of A, B, C is 201.

Each of AB, AC, BC is 1, as the only solution where both a=100 and b=100 is (100,100,100), same for the others.

And ABC is 1, since all three being 100 is the same solution.

So,

Total = (201 + 201 + 201) - (1 + 1 + 1) + 1

Compute:

3*201 = 603
3*1 = 3
So, 603 - 3 + 1 = 601.

Wait, but wait, that can't be right because when we subtract 3 and add 1, it's 603 - 3 = 600, then +1 is 601.

But wait, I think that's correct because we have 3 cases each with 201, but each pair intersection is 1, and the triple intersection is 1.

Wait, let me check again.

Number of solutions where a=100: 201 (including (100,100,100))

Similarly for b=100 and c=100.

So, when we sum A + B + C = 201 * 3 = 603.

But in this 603, the solution (100,100,100) is counted three times.

Each pair (a=100 and b=100) is counted once in AB, AC, BC, which are each 1 solution. So, when we subtract AB + AC + BC = 3, we're removing the overcounts. But wait, since (100,100,100) was counted three times in A+B+C, subtracting 3 removes it entirely, but we need to add it back once because it should be counted once in the total.

So, the formula is correct: Total = 603 - 3 + 1 = 601.

But wait, that seems a bit odd. Let me think differently.

Wait, how many unique solutions do we have?

We have all triples where a=100, which are 201, plus all where b=100 (another 201), plus all where c=100 (another 201), but we have overlaps.

The overlap between a=100 and b=100 is exactly one solution: (100,100,100). Similarly, overlaps between a=100 and c=100 is the same solution, and between b=100 and c=100 is the same solution.

So, when we add 201 + 201 + 201, we're counting (100,100,100) three times. Then, when we subtract 1 + 1 + 1, we're removing two counts of it each time, so 3 - 3 + 1 = 1? Hmm, that doesn't seem to fit.

Wait, perhaps another approach: the number of triples where at least one of a, b, c is 100 is equal to the sum of the counts for each variable being 100, minus the counts where two variables are 100, plus the count where all three are 100.

But in our case, the only way two variables can be 100 is if all three are 100, because if a=100 and b=100, then c=100 as well, due to the sum being 300.

Therefore, the inclusion-exclusion formula gives:

Number of triples = (201 + 201 + 201) - (1 + 1 + 1) + (1) = 603 - 3 + 1 = 601.

So, according to this, the total number of triples is 601.

But wait, let's double-check.

Wait, when a=100, the number of solutions is 201, including the case where b=100 and c=100. Similarly, when b=100, the number is 201, including the case where a=100 and c=100. So, when we add all three, (100,100,100) is counted three times, each in a different case.

So, to find the correct total, we need to subtract the duplicates.

The number of duplicates where two variables are 100 is 3, but actually, each of these duplicates is the same triple (100,100,100). So, we subtract 3 (for each pair of variables being 100), but then we have subtracted the triple (100,100,100) three times, so we need to add it back once.

So, inclusion-exclusion gives:

Total = 3*201 - 3*1 + 1 = 603 - 3 + 1 = 601.

So, the total number of triples is 601.

But wait, let me check if this makes sense.

We have 201 solutions when a=100, which includes (100,100,100). Similarly for b=100 and c=100. So, the total count before inclusion-exclusion is 603, but this counts (100,100,100) three times. The number of triples where exactly one variable is 100 is 201 - 1 = 200 in each case (since each case includes the triple where two others are 100, but in reality, that's just one triple). Wait, no, when a=100, the only triple where another variable is 100 is when b=100, which forces c=100. So, in the a=100 case, the only triple with another 100 is (100,100,100). So, the number of triples where exactly a=100 and b≠100 and c≠100 is 200, because out of 201, one is (100,100,100).

Similarly, for b=100 and c=100, same thing.

So, number of triples with exactly one variable being 100: 3*(201 - 1) = 3*200 = 600.

Plus the triple where all three are 100: 1.

Total: 600 + 1 = 601.

Yes, that adds up correctly.

So, the total number of triples is 601.

Wait, but earlier I thought that any a=100, b + c=200 would satisfy the second equation, which is why each case had 201 solutions.

But let me double-check with specific numbers.

Suppose a=100, b=0, c=200.

Check the second equation:

a²b + a²c + b²a + b²c + c²a + c²b

= (100)^2*0 + (100)^2*200 + 0^2*100 + 0^2*200 + (200)^2*100 + (200)^2*0

= 0 + 10,000*200 + 0 + 0 + 40,000*100 + 0

= 2,000,000 + 4,000,000 = 6,000,000.

Yes, that works.

Another example: a=100, b=100, c=100.

Compute the second equation:

(100)^2*100 + (100)^2*100 + (100)^2*100 + (100)^2*100 + (100)^2*100 + (100)^2*100

= 6*(100^3) = 6*1,000,000 = 6,000,000. Correct.

Another example: a=100, b=50, c=150.

Compute the second equation:

100²*50 + 100²*150 + 50²*100 + 50²*150 + 150²*100 + 150²*50

= 10,000*50 + 10,000*150 + 2,500*100 + 2,500*150 + 22,500*100 + 22,500*50

Compute each term:

10,000*50 = 500,000

10,000*150 = 1,500,000

2,500*100 = 250,000

2,500*150 = 375,000

22,500*100 = 2,250,000

22,500*50 = 1,125,000

Add them up:

500,000 + 1,500,000 = 2,000,000

250,000 + 375,000 = 625,000

2,250,000 + 1,125,000 = 3,375,000

Total: 2,000,000 + 625,000 = 2,625,000

2,625,000 + 3,375,000 = 6,000,000. Correct.

So, indeed, when a=100, any b and c that sum to 200 will satisfy the second equation.

Therefore, my earlier conclusion holds, and the total number of solutions is 601.

But wait, wait, in the inclusion-exclusion, when I subtracted the intersections, I subtracted 3, which were the cases where two variables were 100, but each of these is actually the same triple (100,100,100). So, each of the three intersections AB, AC, BC is just the single triple where all three are 100.

So, the correct inclusion-exclusion formula is:

|A ∪ B ∪ C| = |A| + |B| + |C| - |A ∩ B| - |A ∩ C| - |B ∩ C| + |A ∩ B ∩ C|

Here, |A ∩ B| = |A ∩ C| = |B ∩ C| = 1, because the only way both a=100 and b=100 is if c=100 as well.

Similarly, |A ∩ B ∩ C| = 1.

So, substituting:

|A ∪ B ∪ C| = 201 + 201 + 201 - 1 -1 -1 +1 = 603 - 3 + 1 = 601.

Yes, that's correct.

Therefore, the total number of triples is 601.

Wait, but 601 seems a bit high. Let me think again: for each of the three cases (a=100, etc.), we have 201 solutions. But if a=100 and b=100, then c=100 as well, which is just one solution. So, in the 201 solutions for a=100, 200 have c ≠100, and 1 has c=100. Similarly for others. So, the total unique solutions would be 3*(201) - 3*(1) +1 = 603 -3 +1=601.

Yes, that seems right.

So, I think that the answer is 601.


The problem requires finding the number of triples of nonnegative integers \((a, b, c)\) satisfying \(a + b + c = 300\) and \(a^2b + a^2c + b^2a + b^2c + c^2a + c^2b = 6,000,000\).

Starting with the given equations:
1. \(a + b + c = 300\)
2. \(a^2b + a^2c + b^2a + b^2c + c^2a + c^2b = 6,000,000\)

The second equation is rewritten as:
\[a^2(b + c) + b^2(a + c) + c^2(a + b) = 6,000,000\]

Substituting \(b + c = 300 - a\), \(a + c = 300 - b\), and \(a + b = 300 - c\) into the equation gives:
\[300(a^2 + b^2 + c^2) - (a^3 + b^3 + c^3) = 6,000,000\]

Using the identity \((a + b + c)^2 = a^2 + b^2 + c^2 + 2(ab + bc + ca)\), we find:
\[90,000 = a^2 + b^2 + c^2 + 2(ab + bc + ca)\]
Let \(S = a^2 + b^2 + c^2\) and \(P = ab + bc + ca\), so:
\[S = 90,000 - 2P\]

Substituting \(S\) and the expression for \(a^3 + b^3 + c^3\) into the equation:
\[300(90,000 - 2P) - (27,000,000 - 900P + 3abc) = 6,000,000\]
Simplifying leads to:
\[300P - 3abc = 6,000,000\]
\[100P - abc = 2,000,000\]

Rewriting this as:
\[(a - 100)(b - 100)(c - 100) = 0\]
implies at least one of \(a\), \(b\), or \(c\) must be 100.

Considering each case where one variable is 100:
- If \(a = 100\), then \(b + c = 200\). The number of solutions is 201.
- Similarly, for \(b = 100\) and \(c = 100\), each case has 201 solutions.

Using inclusion-exclusion principle:
- Total solutions without overlap: \(3 \times 201 = 603\).
- Subtract overlaps where two variables are 100: Each overlap is 1 solution, so subtract 3.
- Add back the case where all three are 100: 1 solution.

Thus, the total number of solutions is:
\[603 - 3 + 1 = 601\]

The final answer is:
\[\boxed{601}\]
