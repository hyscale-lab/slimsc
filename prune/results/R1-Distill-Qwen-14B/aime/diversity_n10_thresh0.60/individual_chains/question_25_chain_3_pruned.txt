Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find out how many residents of Aimeville own all four items: a diamond ring, a set of golf clubs, a garden spade, and a bag of candy hearts. Let me try to break this down step by step.

First, the problem gives me some numbers. There are 900 residents in total. Out of these, 195 own a diamond ring, 367 own golf clubs, 562 own a garden spade, and every single resident owns a bag of candy hearts. That's interesting because it means the candy hearts are owned by everyone, so the number of people owning candy hearts is 900.

Now, the problem also states that 437 residents own exactly two of these things, and 234 own exactly three of them. My goal is to find out how many own all four. Hmm, this sounds like a problem that involves the principle of inclusion-exclusion, which I think is used to calculate the size of the union of multiple sets by considering their intersections.

Let me recall the inclusion-exclusion formula. For four sets A, B, C, D, the formula for the total number of elements in their union is:

|A ∪ B ∪ C ∪ D| = |A| + |B| + |C| + |D| - |A ∩ B| - |A ∩ C| - |A ∩ D| - |B ∩ C| - |B ∩ D| - |C ∩ D| + |A ∩ B ∩ C| + |A ∩ B ∩ D| + |A ∩ C ∩ D| + |B ∩ C ∩ D| - |A ∩ B ∩ C ∩ D|

But wait, in this problem, we aren't directly given the sizes of all these intersections. Instead, we're given the number of people who own exactly two or exactly three items. So maybe I should think about how these numbers relate to the inclusion-exclusion formula.

I remember that in such problems, the number of elements in exactly k of the sets can be related to the inclusion-exclusion terms. Let me think: for exactly two items, each of those 437 residents is counted once in each pair of sets. Similarly, those who own exactly three items are each counted once in each triplet of sets, and those who own all four are counted once in the four-way intersection.

Alternatively, I can model the problem using the principle of inclusion-exclusion but considering the counts of people owning exactly one, two, three, or all four items.

Wait, but maybe it's better to consider the total number of ownerships. Since each item is owned by a certain number of people, the total number of ownerships is the sum of each individual item's ownership.

Let me compute that. The total ownerships would be:

Diamond rings: 195
Golf clubs: 367
Garden spades: 562
Candy hearts: 900

Total ownerships = 195 + 367 + 562 + 900

Calculating that: 195 + 367 is 562, plus
