Okay, so I'm trying to solve this problem about Aya's walks. Let me read through it again to make sure I understand what's being asked.

Every morning, Aya goes for a 9-kilometer-long walk and stops at a coffee shop afterwards. She walks at a constant speed of s kilometers per hour, and this takes her 4 hours, including t minutes spent in the coffee shop. When she walks at s+2 km/h, the walk takes her 2 hours and 24 minutes, which also includes the same t minutes in the coffee shop. Now, we need to find out how long her walk takes when she walks at s + 1/2 km/h, including the t minutes again.

Hmm. So, the key here is that the time she spends walking plus the time she spends in the coffee shop equals the total time mentioned. Since both scenarios include t minutes in the coffee shop, t should be the same in both cases. So, maybe I can set up two equations and solve for s and t.

Let me think about the first scenario. She walks 9 km at s km/h. So, the time she spends walking is distance divided by speed, which is 9/s hours. But the total time is 4 hours, which includes t minutes. Wait, but time is in hours and t is in minutes, so I should convert everything to the same units. Let's convert t minutes to hours by dividing by 60. So, the total time is 4 hours = walking time + t/60 hours.

Similarly, in the second scenario, she walks 9 km at s+2 km/h. So, the walking time is 9/(s+2) hours. The total time here is 2 hours and 24 minutes. Let's convert 24 minutes to hours: 24/60 = 0.4 hours. So, 2.4 hours total. Again, this is walking time plus t/60 hours.

So, summarizing:

First equation: 9/s + t/60 = 4
Second equation: 9/(s+2) + t/60 = 2.4

So, we have two equations with two variables, s and t. I can solve these equations simultaneously.

Let me write them down:

1) 9/s + t/60 = 4
2) 9/(s+2) + t/60 = 2.4

Hmm, since both equations have t/60, maybe I can subtract one equation from the other to eliminate t.

Subtracting equation 2 from equation 1:

[9/s + t/60] - [9/(s+2) + t/60] = 4 - 2.4

Simplify:

9/s - 9/(s+2) = 1.6

So, 9/s - 9/(s+2) = 1.6

Let me compute this left side:

9/s - 9/(s+2) = 9*(1/s - 1/(s+2)) = 9*[(s+2 - s)/(s(s+2))] = 9*(2)/(s(s+2)) = 18/(s(s+2))

So, 18/(s(s+2)) = 1.6

Thus:

18 = 1.6 * s(s+2)

Let me compute 1.6 * s(s+2) = 1.6s^2 + 3.2s

So, 18 = 1.6s^2 + 3.2s

Let me rewrite this equation:

1.6s^2 + 3.2s - 18 = 0

Hmm, dealing with decimals can be a bit messy. Maybe I can multiply both sides by 10 to eliminate the decimals.

16s^2 + 32s - 180 = 0

Wait, 1.6 *10 is 16, 3.2*10 is 32, 18*10 is 180. But since I multiplied by 10, it's 16s² +32s - 180 =0.

But perhaps I can simplify this equation by dividing all terms by a common factor. Let me see, 16, 32, and 180. Do they have a common divisor?

16 divides by 2 and 8; 32 is 2^5; 180 is divisible by 4, 6, etc. Let's try dividing by 4.

16/4 =4; 32/4=8; 180/4=45. So, the equation becomes:

4s² +8s -45=0

Hmm, that's better.

Now, let me solve this quadratic equation: 4s² +8s -45=0.

I can use the quadratic formula. For an equation ax² +bx +c=0, the solutions are:

s = [-b ± sqrt(b² -4ac)]/(2a)

So, here, a=4, b=8, c=-45.

Discriminant D = b² -4ac = 8² -4*4*(-45) = 64 + 720 = 784.

sqrt(784)=28.

So, s = [-8 ±28]/(2*4)

So, two solutions:

s = (-8 +28)/8 = 20/8 = 2.5

s = (-8 -28)/8 = (-36)/8 = -4.5

But speed can't be negative, so s=2.5 km/h.

Wait, that seems a bit slow for a walk, but okay, maybe she walks leisurely. So, s=2.5 km/h.

Now, we can find t using one of the initial equations. Let's take equation 1:

9/s + t/60 =4

We know s=2.5, so:

9/(2.5) + t/60 =4

Compute 9/2.5: 2.5 is 5/2, so 9/(5/2)= 9*(2/5)=18/5=3.6 hours

So, 3.6 + t/60 =4

Subtract 3.6: t/60=0.4

Multiply both sides by 60: t=24 minutes.

So, t is 24 minutes.

Now, the question is, when she walks at s + 1/2 km/h, so s=2.5, so s+1/2=2.5 +0.5=3 km/h.

So, her speed is 3 km/h.

Now, compute the time taken for the walk, which is 9 km.

Time = distance/speed =9/3=3 hours.

But the problem says to include the t minutes, which is 24 minutes. So, total time is 3 hours and 24 minutes.

Wait, but the question says, "the number of minutes the walk takes her, including the t minutes spent in the coffee shop." So, we need to express the time in minutes.

3 hours is 180 minutes, plus 24 minutes is 204 minutes.

Wait, but let me double-check. Because in the first scenario, when she walked at 2.5 km/h, the total time was 4 hours, which included 24 minutes in the coffee shop. So, the walking time was 3.6 hours, which is 3 hours and 36 minutes. Then, adding 24 minutes, that would make 4 hours.

Similarly, in the second scenario, walking at 2.5+2=4.5 km/h, the walking time is 9/4.5=2 hours. Then, adding 24 minutes, the total time is
