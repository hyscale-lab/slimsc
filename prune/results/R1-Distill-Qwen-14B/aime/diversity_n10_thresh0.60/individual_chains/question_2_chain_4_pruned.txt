Okay, so I'm trying to solve this geometry problem. Let me read it again to make sure I understand all the parts.

We have three points: O at (0,0), A at (1/2, 0), and B at (0, sqrt(3)/2). These points form a line segment AB. Then there's a family F of segments PQ of unit length (so each PQ is 1 unit long) lying in the first quadrant. Each P is on the x-axis and Q is on the y-axis. So, PQ is a line segment from the x-axis to the y-axis, length 1, in the first quadrant.

The problem says that there's a unique point C on AB, not A or B, that doesn't lie on any segment from F except for AB itself. So, C is on AB, and for any other segment PQ in F, C isn't on PQ. We need to find OC squared, which is the square of the distance from the origin to point C, and express it as a fraction p/q where p and q are coprime. Then find p + q.

Hmm. So, first, I think I need to find the equation for line AB. Let me do that first.

Points A and B are at (1/2, 0) and (0, sqrt(3)/2). So, the slope of AB is (sqrt(3)/2 - 0)/(0 - 1/2) = (sqrt(3)/2) / (-1/2) = -sqrt(3). So, the slope is -sqrt(3). Therefore, the equation of AB is y = -sqrt(3)x + b. Plugging in point A: 0 = -sqrt(3)*(1/2) + b => b = sqrt(3)/2. So, the equation is y = -sqrt(3)x + sqrt(3)/2. Wait, is that right? Let me check with point B. When x=0, y should be sqrt(3)/2. Yeah, that's correct.

So equation of AB is y = -sqrt(3)x + sqrt(3)/2.

Now, point C is some point on AB, so it must satisfy that equation. Let me denote point C as (x, y) where y = -sqrt(3)x + sqrt(3)/2.

We need to find OC^2, which is x^2 + y^2. So, once we find x and y, we can compute this.

But how do we find x and y? The key seems to be that point C is the unique point on AB that isn't on any other segment PQ from family F.

So, first, let's understand family F. It consists of segments PQ where P is on the x-axis, Q on y-axis, PQ has length 1, and is in the first quadrant. So, for each such PQ, we can parametrize P as (p, 0) and Q as (0, q) with p and q positive real numbers.

Since PQ has length 1, the distance between (p,0) and (0,q) must be 1. So, sqrt(p^2 + q^2) = 1, which implies p^2 + q^2 = 1.

So, each PQ is a segment from (p,0) to (0,q) where p and q satisfy p^2 + q^2 = 1, and p, q > 0.

So, the family F is all such segments for p and q in (0,1) since p^2 + q^2 = 1 and p, q positive.

Now, each segment PQ is a line between (p,0) and (0,q). So, the equation of PQ can be found.

The equation of line PQ: Let's find the intercept form. Since it passes through (p,0) and (0,q), the intercept form is x/p + y/q = 1.

So, the equation is x/p + y/q = 1.

We can also write this in slope-intercept form. The slope m is (q - 0)/(0 - p) = -q/p. So, the equation is y = (-q/p)x + q.

But maybe the intercept form is more useful here.

So, any point on PQ must satisfy x/p + y/q = 1.

Now, point C lies on AB and also on some PQ from F. But the problem states that C is not on any other PQ in F except AB itself. So, AB must be one of the PQ segments.

Wait, let me think. AB is a segment from (1/2, 0) to (0, sqrt(3)/2). So, if we compute p and q for AB, p = 1/2 and q = sqrt(3)/2. Let's check if p^2 + q^2 = (1/2)^2 + (sqrt(3)/2)^2 = 1/4 + 3/4 = 1. Yes, so AB is indeed in family F.

So, AB is part of F. Then, point C is on AB, so it's on PQ = AB, but not on any other PQ in F.

So, we need to find a point C on AB such that it's not on any other PQ from F except AB. So, for any other PQ in F, C is not on PQ.

So, the problem reduces to finding a point C on AB such that C is not on any other PQ from F except AB
