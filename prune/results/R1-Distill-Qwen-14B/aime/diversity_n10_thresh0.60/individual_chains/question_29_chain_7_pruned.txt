Okay, so I've got this geometry problem here, and I need to figure out the length of CE. Let me read the problem again to make sure I understand all the details.

We have two rectangles, ABCD and EFGH. The points D, E, C, F are collinear. Also, points A, D, H, G all lie on a circle. The given lengths are BC = 16, AB = 107, FG = 17, and EF = 184. I need to find CE.

Alright, let me visualize this. Since ABCD and EFGH are rectangles, all their angles are right angles. Let me try to draw a rough sketch in my mind. So, rectangle ABCD has AB = 107 and BC = 16. That means AB is the longer side, so ABCD is a tall rectangle, right? Because AB is 107, BC is 16, so the sides are 107 and 16.

Similarly, rectangle EFGH has sides FG = 17 and EF = 184. So, EF is the longer side, 184 units, and FG is 17 units.

Now, D, E, C, F are collinear. That means these four points lie on a straight line. So, the line passes through D, E, C, F in some order. Hmm, need to figure out the order.

Also, points A, D, H, G lie on a circle. So, quadrilateral ADHG is cyclic.

Let me try to figure out the positions of the rectangles. ABCD is a rectangle, so the sides AB and CD are both 107, and BC and AD are both 16. Similarly, EFGH is a rectangle with EF = 184 and FG = 17, so the sides EF and GH are 184, and FG and EH are 17.

Given that D, E, C, F are collinear, let me think. Point D is a corner of rectangle ABCD, and point C is the opposite corner. So, in rectangle ABCD, if we think of the corners as A, B, C, D going around, then D is adjacent to C and A. So, if D, E, C, F are collinear, the line must pass through D, then E, then C, then F, perhaps?

Wait, that might not make sense because E and F are corners of the other rectangle EFGH. Let me think again.

Alternatively, perhaps the line goes through D, E, C, F in that order. So, starting at D, then E, then C, then F. So, the line passes through D, E, C, F. So, E is between D and C, and F is beyond C.

Alternatively, it might be that the line passes through D, then F, then E, then C. Hmm, not sure. The exact order probably depends on the specific arrangement.

But, since both rectangles are involved, and their sides are connected through these points, perhaps E is a point on DC extended beyond D or C.

Wait, maybe it's better if I assign coordinates to the points to model this.

Let me assign coordinate
