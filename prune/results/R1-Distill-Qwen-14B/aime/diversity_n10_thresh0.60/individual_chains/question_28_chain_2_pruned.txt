Okay, so I have this tetrahedron ABCD with specific edge lengths, and I need to find the distance from the incenter (the point equidistant from all faces) to each face. Hmm, tetrahedrons can be a bit tricky, especially since I'm more familiar with triangles. But let's take it step by step.

First, the problem states that AB = CD = sqrt(41), AC = BD = sqrt(80), and BC = AD = sqrt(89). So, each pair of opposite edges are equal. That seems symmetrical, so maybe the tetrahedron has some kind of symmetry which could help simplify the problem.

I remember that in a tetrahedron, the inradius can be found using the formula: r = 3V / S, where V is the volume and S is the total surface area. So, I need to find the volume V and the surface area S.

But wait, how do I find the volume of this tetrahedron? I know for a regular tetrahedron, there's a straightforward formula, but this isn't regular since the edges are of different lengths. Oh, but maybe it's a kind of symmetrical tetrahedron with congruent faces or something. Let me check.

Wait, the problem mentions that opposite edges are equal: AB=CD, AC=BD, AD=BC. So, this is a kind of tetrahedron known as a "isohedral tetrahedron" or perhaps a "disphenoid." I think a disphenoid is a tetrahedron where opposite edges are equal, and all faces are congruent. Is that the case here?

Let me see: Each face is a triangle. Let's check the lengths for each face.

For triangle ABC: sides AB = sqrt(41), BC = sqrt(89), AC = sqrt(80).

For triangle ABD: sides AB = sqrt(41), BD = sqrt(80), AD = sqrt(89).

Wait, so triangle ABC has sides sqrt(41), sqrt(89), sqrt(80), and triangle ABD has sides sqrt(41), sqrt(80), sqrt(89). So, they have the same side lengths, just in a different order. So, triangles ABC and ABD are congruent. Similarly, let's check the other faces.
