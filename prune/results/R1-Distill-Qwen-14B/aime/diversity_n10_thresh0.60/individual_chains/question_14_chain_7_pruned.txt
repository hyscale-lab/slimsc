Okay, so I'm trying to solve this math problem where I need to find the greatest four-digit number, N, such that if any one of its digits is changed to 1, the resulting number is divisible by 7. Then, I have to find Q + R where Q is the quotient and R is the remainder when N is divided by 1000.

Hmm, let me break this down. First, N is a four-digit number, so it's between 1000 and 9999. It's the greatest such number, so I'm probably looking for the largest possible N that satisfies the given condition.

The condition is that if any single digit of N is changed to 1, the new number is divisible by 7. So for each digit in N, changing it to 1 should result in a number that's a multiple of 7.

Let me denote N as a four-digit number: N = a b c d, where a, b, c, d are its digits. So, a is in 1-9, and b, c, d are 0-9.

The condition implies that:

1. Changing a to 1: 1 b c d must be divisible by 7.
2. Changing b to 1: a 1 c d must be divisible by 7.
3. Changing c to 1: a b 1 d must be divisible by 7.
4. Changing d to 1: a b c 1 must be divisible by 7.

So, all four of these conditions must hold.

Since we're looking for the greatest such N, I should probably start from 9999 and work my way down, checking each number to see if it satisfies these four conditions. But that sounds time-consuming. Maybe there's a smarter way.

First, let's represent N as 1000a + 100b + 10c + d. When we change a digit to 1, we can write expressions for each case:

1. Changing a to 1: 1000*1 + 100b + 10c + d = 1000 + 100b + 10c + d. This must be divisible by 7.
2. Changing b to 1: 1000a + 100*1 + 10c + d = 1000a + 100 + 10c + d. This must be divisible by 7.
3. Changing c to 1: 1000a + 100b + 10*1 + d = 1000a + 100b + 10 + d. This must be divisible by 7.
4. Changing d to 1: 1000a + 100b + 10c + 1. This must be divisible by 7.

So, each of these four numbers must be divisible by 7.

Let me denote the original number as N = 1000a + 100b + 10c + d.

So, for each of the four modified numbers, they equal to some multiple of 7. Let's write each modified number in terms of N.

1. 1000 + 100b + 10c + d = 1000 + (N - 1000a - 100b - 10c - d + 1000a + 100b +10c +d) ??? Hmm, maybe that's not helpful. Let me think differently.

Wait, 1000 + 100b + 10c + d: How does this relate to N? Well, N is 1000a + 100b + 10c + d. So, the modified number when a is changed to 1 is: 1000 + 100b + 10c + d = (1000a + 100b + 10c + d) - (1000a - 1000) = N - 1000(a - 1). That might be a useful expression.

Similarly, the modified number when b is changed to 1 is: 1000a + 100 + 10c + d. Which is N - (100b - 100) = N - 100(b - 1).

Similarly, when c is changed to 1: 1000a + 100b +10 + d = N - (10c -10) = N - 10(c -1).

And when d is changed to 1: 1000a + 100b + 10c + 1 = N - (d -1).

So, each of these four expressions must be divisible by 7.

Which means:

N - 1000(a - 1) ≡ 0 mod 7

N - 100(b -1) ≡ 0 mod 7

N - 10(c -1) ≡ 0 mod 7

N - (d -1) ≡ 0 mod 7

So, for each of these, N ≡ 1000(a -1) mod7, N ≡ 100(b -1) mod7, N ≡ 10(c -1) mod7, and N ≡ (d -1) mod7.

But since N must satisfy all four congruences, each of these must be equal to N mod7.

Wait, but all these expressions must equal N mod7, which is the same as the remainder when N is divided by 7.

Let me denote r = N mod7.

So, for each of the four cases:

r = 1000(a -1) mod7

r = 100(b -1) mod7

r =10(c -1) mod7

r = (d -1) mod7

So, all these four expressions must be congruent mod7.

Which implies that:

1000(a -1) ≡ 100(b -1) ≡ 10(c -1) ≡ (d -1) mod7.

So, all four expressions must be congruent mod7.

Let me compute the coefficients mod7.

1000 mod7: Let me compute 1000 /7.

7*142=994, 1000 -994=6. So 1000 ≡6 mod7.

Similarly, 100 mod7: 7*14=98, so 100-98=2 → 100≡2 mod7.

10 mod7=3.

1 mod7=1.

So, substituting:

6(a -1) ≡ 2(b -1) ≡3(c -1) ≡(d -1) mod7.

So, all four expressions must equal the same value mod7, say k.

So, 6(a-1) ≡k, 2(b-1)≡k, 3(c-1)≡k, and (d-1)≡k mod7.

So, each of these must equal k mod7.

Therefore, I can express each digit in terms of k:

6(a -1) ≡k mod7 → 6a -6 ≡k → 6a ≡k +6 mod7.

Similarly, 2(b-1) ≡k → 2b -2 ≡k → 2b ≡k +2 mod7.

3(c-1) ≡k → 3c -3 ≡k → 3c ≡k +3 mod7.

(d -1) ≡k → d ≡k +1 mod7.

Additionally, since a, b, c, d are digits, a is from 1-9, and b, c, d are 0-9.

But, since we're looking for the greatest N, which is four digits, we can start from 9999 and go down until we find a number that meets all four conditions.

But maybe there's a smarter way.

Since N must satisfy all four congruencies, let's work with each congruence.

Let me note that k is the same for all. So, we can set up equations:

From the first equation: 6a ≡k +6 mod7.

Multiply both sides by the inverse of 6 mod7. Since 6 and7 are coprime, the inverse of6 mod7 is a number x such that 6x ≡1 mod7. Testing x=6: 6*6=36≡1 mod7 (since 35 is divisible by7). So, inverse is6.

Thus, multiplying both sides:

a ≡6*(k+6) mod7.

Similarly, second equation: 2b ≡k +2 mod7. The inverse of2 mod7 is4, since 2*4=8≡1 mod7.

So, b ≡4*(k+2) mod7.

Third equation: 3c ≡k +3 mod7. The inverse of3 mod7 is5, since3*5=15≡1 mod7.

So, c ≡5*(k +3) mod7.

Fourth equation: d ≡k +1 mod7.

So, now, I can express each digit in terms of k.

Let me compute each expression:

a ≡6*(k +6) mod7.

6*(k+6) =6k +36. 36 mod7 is 1, since 35 is 5*7, so 36≡1 mod7.

So, 6k +1 mod7. So, a ≡6k +1 mod7.

Similarly, b ≡4*(k +2) mod7.

4*(k +2) =4k +8. 8 mod7 is1, so 4k +1 mod7.

So, b ≡4k +1 mod7.

c ≡5*(k +3) mod7.

5*(k +3) =5k +15. 15 mod7 is1, so 5k +1 mod7.

c ≡5k +1 mod7.

d ≡k +1 mod7.

So, all four digits are functions of k mod7. Moreover, since a, b, c, d are digits, each must satisfy certain constraints.

But since a is from1-9, and is congruent to6k +1 mod7, and a must be a digit, a must be in1-9, so a = (6k +1) mod7, but can it be more than 7? Well, since k can be from0 to6, let's compute a for each k:

Similarly for b, c, d.

Wait, perhaps it's better to consider all possible values of k (0 to6) and see what digits a, b, c, d would satisfy the congruence, and then find the largest N.

Given that N is as large as possible, we want a to be as large as possible (preferably 9), then b as large as possible, etc.

So, let's consider each possible k from0 to6, compute the corresponding a, b, c, d, and see which gives the largest N.

But wait, there's a problem
