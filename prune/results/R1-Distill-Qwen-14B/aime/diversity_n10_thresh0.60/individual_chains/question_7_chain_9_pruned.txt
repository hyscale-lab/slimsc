Okay, so I have this problem about a regular octagon where each vertex is colored either red or blue, each with a 50% chance. I need to find the probability that after coloring, there's a rotation that turns all the blue vertices into positions where originally there were red vertices. The answer needs to be in the form m/n where m and n are coprime, and then find m + n.

Hmm, let me break this down. First, each vertex is independently colored red or blue. So, for each vertex, there's a 1/2 chance of red and 1/2 chance of blue. The octagon has 8 vertices, so the total number of possible colorings is 2^8 = 256. That seems straightforward.

Now, the interesting part is the rotation condition. We need to find colorings where, after some rotation, all the blue vertices end up where there were originally red vertices. Let me think about what that means. So, after rotating the octagon by some number of positions, every blue vertex in the new position was red in the original coloring.

Wait, maybe I should rephrase that. Let me denote the original coloring as a sequence of colors around the octagon. Then, a rotation by k positions would shift each vertex's color to the next k positions. So, if I rotate the octagon by k positions, the color at position i in the original moves to position (i + k) mod 8.

For the condition to hold, every blue vertex in the original coloring must, after rotation, land on a position that was originally red. So, for each blue vertex at position i, the color at (i + k) mod 8 in the original coloring must be red.

Wait, that makes sense. So, if I have a coloring where all the blue vertices are in positions such that when I rotate by k, they end up on reds, then this condition is satisfied.

But the problem is that the rotation k can be any number from 0 to 7 (since it's a regular octagon, rotations by multiples of 45 degrees, which are 8 in total). So, for each coloring, I need to check if there exists some k such that for every blue vertex at position i, the color at (i + k) mod 8 is red.

Alternatively, maybe it's better to think in terms of functions. Think of the coloring as a function c: {0,1,2,3,4,5
