Okay, so I've got this problem here about points O, A, and B. O is at (0,0), A is at (1/2, 0), and B is at (0, sqrt(3)/2). There's this family F of segments PQ of unit length in the first quadrant, with P on the x-axis and Q on the y-axis. The question is about finding a point C on AB, not A or B, such that C doesn't lie on any other segment from F except AB. Then, we need to find OC squared, which will be a fraction p/q, and then compute p+q.

Hmm, let me parse this. So, family F consists of all segments PQ where P is on the x-axis, Q is on the y-axis, and PQ has length 1. Each such segment is a unit segment connecting the axes in the first quadrant.

I think these segments PQ can be described parametrically. Let me see: if P is (x, 0) on the x-axis and Q is (0, y) on the y-axis, then the length of PQ is sqrt(x² + y²) = 1. So, x² + y² = 1.

So, each segment PQ is determined by a point (x, 0) and (0, y) such that x² + y² = 1. So, for each x in [0,1], y is sqrt(1 - x²), since we're in the first quadrant. So, the family F is all such segments from (x, 0) to (0, sqrt(1 - x²)).

Now, the point C is on AB, distinct from A and B, and doesn't lie on any other segment from F except AB. So, AB is itself a segment from F? Let me check: O is (0,0), A is (1/2, 0), and B is (0, sqrt(3)/2). So, AB connects (1/2, 0) to (0, sqrt(3)/2). Let's see if AB is a unit segment.

Compute the distance between A and B: sqrt[(1/2 - 0)^2 + (0 - sqrt(3)/2)^2] = sqrt[(1/4) + (3/4)] = sqrt(1) = 1. Oh, right, AB is part of the family F since it's a unit segment with P on x-axis and Q on y-axis. So, AB is one of these segments, and C is on AB but not on any other segment from F.

So, we need to find point C on AB such that it's not on any other PQ in F except AB. So, our goal is to find such a point C, compute OC squared, and find p+q where OC² = p/q.

I think the way to approach this is to parametrize AB and then find where C is such that it doesn't lie on any other PQ from F. So, first, let's parametrize AB.

Parametrize AB: starting at A (1/2, 0) moving to B (0, sqrt(3)/2). Let me write the parametric equations. Let t be a parameter from 0 to 1, where t=0 is A and t=1 is B.

So, x(t) = (1/2) - (1/2)t, since moving from 1/2 to 0 as t goes from 0 to 1. Similarly, y(t) = 0 + (sqrt(3)/2) t.

So, x(t) = (1 - t)/2, and y(t) = (sqrt(3) t)/2.

So, the point C is ( (1 - t)/2, (sqrt(3) t)/2 ) for some t between 0 and 1, but not equal to 0 or 1.

Now, we need to ensure that C is not on any other PQ in F except AB. So, suppose there's another segment PQ in F, i.e., PQ is from (x,0) to (0, y) with x² + y² =1. If C is also on PQ, then C must satisfy the equation of the line PQ.

So, let's find the equation of PQ. Since PQ goes from (x,0) to (0,y), it's a straight line. The equation can be written as (X/x) + (Y/y) = 1, where X and Y are the coordinates.

So, for a general PQ in F, the line is X/x + Y/y = 1, with x² + y² =1.

Now, point C lies on AB, so it's on PQ if it satisfies X/x + Y/y =1.

So, if C is on PQ, then (( (1 - t)/2 ) / x ) + ( (sqrt(3) t / 2 ) / y ) = 1.

But C is also on AB, so for each t, C is a point on AB, and we want to make sure that the only PQ that includes C is AB itself. So, for all other PQ in F, this equation should not hold. So, we need to find t such that the equation above only holds when PQ is AB.

Wait, maybe another approach. Since AB is a specific PQ in F. So, AB is the segment from (1/2, 0) to (0, sqrt(3)/2). So, for AB, x = 1/2, y = sqrt(3)/2, which satisfy x² + y² = (1/4) + (3/4) = 1. So, AB is in F.

So, for the point C on AB, which is not A or B, we need to ensure that C is not on any other PQ in F. So, suppose there exists another PQ in F, different from AB, that also contains C. Then, we need to find the t such that C is only on AB, and no other PQ.

So, perhaps the point C is such that it's the only intersection point of AB with all the other PQs in F. So, to find such a point, we can think of solving for when the line PQ (for some x, y with x² + y²=1) passes through C. So, for each t, we can write the condition that there exists x, y with x² + y²=1, and the line xX + yY = xy (since X/x + Y/y=1 is equivalent to xX + yY = xy? Wait, no: Let's see, starting from X/x + Y/y =1, multiplying both sides by xy: yX + xY = xy. So, equation is yX + xY = xy.

So, substituting C's coordinates: y*( (1-t)/2 ) + x*( (sqrt(3) t)/2 ) = x y.

So, let me write that equation:

y*( (1 - t)/2 ) + x*( (sqrt(3) t)/2 ) = x y.

We can rearrange this equation:

Multiply both sides by 2:

y(1 - t) + x sqrt(3) t = 2 x y.

Bring all terms to one side:

y(1 - t) + x sqrt(3) t - 2 x y = 0.

Factor:

y(1 - t - 2x) + x sqrt(3) t = 0.

Hmm, but since x² + y² =1, perhaps we can express y in terms of x, or vice versa.

Alternatively, perhaps we can solve for x in terms of y, or vice versa.

Wait, but for a given t, this is an equation in x and y, with x² + y²=1. So, for each t, the condition that C lies on PQ implies that (x, y) must satisfy both equations.

So, let's write the equation:

y(1 - t) + x sqrt(3) t = 2 x y.

Let me rearrange it:

y(1 - t) = 2 x y - x sqrt(3) t.

Bring all terms to left:

y(1 - t) - 2 x y + x sqrt(3) t = 0.

Factor y:

y(1 - t - 2x) + x sqrt(3) t = 0.

Hmm, maybe I can express y in terms of x or vice versa.

From x² + y² =1, y = sqrt(1 - x²), but that might complicate things.

Alternatively, perhaps express y as a function of x, and substitute into the equation.

Wait, but perhaps to make this easier, let's consider the equation as:

y(1 - t) + x sqrt(3) t = 2 x y.

Let me write this as:

2 x y - y(1 - t) - x sqrt(3) t = 0.

Factor y:

y(2x - (1 - t)) - x sqrt(3) t = 0.

So,

y(2x - (1 - t)) = x sqrt(3) t.

Thus,

y = [x sqrt(3) t] / [2x - (1 - t)].

But since x² + y² =1, substitute y into that equation.

So,

x² + [ (x sqrt(3) t) / (2x - (1 - t)) ]² = 1.

That's a bit messy, but perhaps we can write it as:

Let me denote D = 2x - (1 - t).

Then,

x² + [ (x sqrt(3) t) / D ]² =1.

So,

x² + (3 x² t² ) / D² =1.

Factor x²:

x² [1 + (3 t² ) / D² ] =1.

So,

x² = 1 / [1 + (3 t² ) / D² ].

But D=2x - (1 - t).

Alternatively, maybe cross-multiplying earlier.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to set variables.

Wait, maybe let me consider the equation:

y(1 - t) + x sqrt(3) t = 2 x y.

Let me solve for y:

y(1 - t) = 2 x y - x sqrt(3) t.

Bring terms with y to the left:

y(1 - t - 2x) = - x sqrt(3) t.

Thus,

y = [ - x sqrt(3) t ] / (1 - t - 2x).

But since y must be positive (as we're in the first quadrant), the numerator and denominator must have the same sign.

So,

[ - x sqrt(3) t ] / (1 - t - 2x) > 0.

So, either both numerator and denominator are positive or both are negative.

But x is between 0 and 1, t is between 0 and 1. So, x is positive, t is positive. So, numerator is negative because of the negative sign. So denominator must also be negative for y to be positive.

So,

1 - t - 2x < 0.

Thus,

1 - t < 2x.

So,

x > (1 - t)/2.

But since x is on the x-axis, it's between 0 and 1.

Now, from above, y = [ - x sqrt(3) t ] / (1 - t - 2x).

Since 1 - t - 2x is negative, the denominator is negative, so y is positive as expected.

Now, since x² + y² =1, let's substitute y:

x² + [ ( - x sqrt(3) t ) / (1 - t - 2x) ]² = 1.

Compute that:

x² + [ (3 x² t²) / (1 - t - 2x)^2 ] = 1.

Let me factor x²:

x² [ 1 + (3 t²)/(1 - t - 2x)^2 ] =1.

Let me denote u = 1 - t - 2x.

Then,

x² [1 + (3 t²)/u² ] =1.

But u = 1 - t - 2x, so I can express x in terms of u:

2x = 1 - t - u.

So,

x = (1 - t - u)/2.

Therefore,

x² = (1 - t - u)^2 /4.

Substituting into the earlier equation:

(1 - t - u)^2 /4 [1 + (3 t²)/(u²) ] =1.

Multiply both sides by 4:

(1 - t - u)^2 [1 + (3 t²)/u² ] =4.

Let me expand (1 - t - u)^2:

= (1 - t)^2 - 2(1 - t)u + u².

So,

[ (1 - t)^2 - 2(1 - t)u + u² ] [1 + (3 t²)/u² ] =4.

Now, let me multiply term by term.

First, expand the first bracket:

A = (1 - t)^2 - 2(1 - t)u + u².

Then, multiply by B = 1 + (3 t²)/u².

So,

A*B = [ (1 - t)^2 - 2(1 - t)u + u² ] * [1 + (3 t²)/u² ].

Multiply term by term:

= (1 - t)^2 *1 + (1 - t)^2*(3 t²)/u² - 2(1 - t)u *1 - 2(1 - t)u*(3 t²)/u² + u² *1 + u²*(3 t²)/u².

Simplify each term:

= (1 - t)^2 + [3 t² (1 - t)^2 ] / u² - 2(1 - t)u - [6 t² (1 - t) u ] / u² + u² + 3 t².

Simplify further terms:

- [6 t² (1 - t) u ] / u² = -6 t² (1 - t)/u.

Similarly, 3 t² (1 - t)^2 / u² is as is, and the rest:

= (1 - t)^2 - 2 (1 - t) u + u² + [3 t² (1 - t)^2 / u²] - [6 t² (1 - t)/u ] + 3 t².

This seems complicated, but perhaps we can collect like terms.

Let me write all terms:

Terms without u:

(1 - t)^2 + 3 t².

Terms with u:

-2(1 - t)u.

Terms with 1/u:

-6 t² (1 - t)/u.

Terms with 1/u²:

3 t² (1 - t)^2 / u².

And the u² term: u².

So, putting it all together:

u² + (1 - t)^2 + 3 t² - 2(1 - t)u -6 t² (1 - t)/u + [3 t² (1 - t)^2 ] / u² =4.

Hmm, this is a quartic equation in u, but seems very messy. Maybe I should think differently.

Wait, perhaps there's a different approach. Since AB is a segment in F, and we are looking for a point C on AB that is not on any other PQ from F. So, perhaps the point C is the point where AB is tangent to some envelope of the family F. Or, another idea: the set of all lines PQ in F form a family of lines, and their envelope might be a curve. C would lie on AB and also on this envelope, perhaps.

Alternatively, maybe using the concept of the envelope of a family of curves. The envelope is a curve that is tangent to each member of the family at some point. So, perhaps the envelope of F is a curve, and the point C is where AB is tangent to this envelope, so that C is the only point of intersection between AB and the envelope, making it unique.

Alternatively, perhaps parametrize the family F and find where AB intersects with another PQ in F, and ensure that such an intersection only occurs at C.

Wait, maybe for a point C on AB, the line AB intersects another PQ from F only at C. So, if we can find t such that for some other x and y (so x≠1/2 and y≠sqrt(3)/2), the line PQ passes through C.

So, perhaps for a given t, we can find x and y such that the line PQ passes through C.

Wait, earlier, we started down this path, but it got too complicated. Maybe we can think of this as for each x in (0,1), there's a line PQ in F, and we want to find for which t the point C is on AB and also on PQ for some x≠1/2.

So, if for a certain t, the equation y( (1-t)/2 ) + x ( sqrt(3) t /2 ) = x y has a solution (x, y) with x² + y²=1, x≠1/2, then C would lie on another PQ.

But we want t such that this equation only holds when x=1/2 and y=sqrt(3)/2. So, to ensure that no other x, y satisfy the equation.

Wait, perhaps the equation has only one solution (x=1/2, y=sqrt(3)/2) for a particular t.

So, maybe we can find t where the system of equations:

y( (1 - t)/2 ) + x ( sqrt(3) t /2 ) = x y,

and

x² + y² =1,

has only one solution (x, y) = (1/2, sqrt(3)/2).

So, for such t, the line AB is tangent to the envelope of F.

Wait, if we can find t where the system has a unique solution, that would mean that the line AB is tangent to the envelope of the family F.

So, perhaps to find such t, we can set the system to have exactly one solution, which would imply that the line PQ is tangent to the envelope.

Alternatively, perhaps we can think of this as the point C being the point where AB is tangent to the envelope curve of F.

So, first, let's find the envelope of the family F.

The family F consists of lines X/x + Y/y =1, with x² + y²=1, and x, y >0.

The envelope can be found by solving the system:

X/x + Y/y =1,

and

d/dλ (X/x + Y/y - λ(x² + y² -1))=0,

where λ is a parameter.

Wait, more precisely, the envelope is found by solving:

F(x, y, X, Y) = X/x + Y/y -1 =0,

and

dF/dλ =0,

where λ is a parameter that parameterizes the family. But in this case, each member of the family is parameterized by x (since y is determined by x via x² + y²=1). So, perhaps we can parameterize by x, and then find the envelope.

Let me denote the parameter as x, so y = sqrt(1 - x²).

So, the equation of the line is X/x + Y / sqrt(1 - x²) =1.

Then, the envelope is found by solving:

X/x + Y / sqrt(1 - x²) =1,

and

d/dx (X/x + Y / sqrt(1 - x²) -1 )=0.

Wait, no, the envelope is found by solving F(x, X, Y)=0 and dF/dx=0, treating x as a parameter.

So, F(x, X, Y) = X/x + Y / sqrt(1 - x²) -1 =0.

Compute dF/dx:

dF/dx = (-X)/x² + ( Y * x ) / ( (1 - x²)^(3/2) ) =0.

So, we have two equations:

1. X/x + Y / sqrt(1 - x²) =1,

2. (-X)/x² + ( Y x ) / ( (1 - x²)^(3/2) ) =0.

So, we can solve these two equations for X and Y in terms of x.

Let me denote sqrt(1 - x²) as y for simplicity, so y = sqrt(1 - x²).

Then, equation 1:

X/x + Y/y =1.

Equation 2:

(-X)/x² + ( Y x ) / ( y^3 ) =0.

So, from equation 2:

(Y x ) / y^3 = X / x².

Multiply both sides by x²:

Y x^3 / y^3 = X.

So, X = (x^3 / y^3) Y.

Now, substitute X into equation 1:

( (x^3 / y^3) Y ) / x + Y/y =1.

Simplify:

( x² / y³ ) Y + Y / y =1.

Factor Y:

Y ( x² / y³ + 1/y ) =1.

Factor 1/y:

Y ( (x² + y²) / y³ ) =1.

But x² + y²=1, so:

Y (1 / y³ ) =1.

Therefore,

Y = y³.

Now, since Y = y³ and X = (x^3 / y^3) Y = (x^3 / y^3) * y^3 = x^3.

So, X= x^3, Y= y^3.

But y = sqrt(1 - x²), so Y= (1 - x²)^(3/2).

Thus, the envelope is the parametric curve:

X = x^3,

Y = (1 - x²)^(3/2),

where x ∈ (0,1).

So, that's the envelope of the family F.

Now, the envelope is the curve that is tangent to each line PQ in F. So, each PQ is tangent to the envelope at exactly one point.

Now, our AB is itself a PQ in F, so the point of tangency is the point where AB touches the envelope.

Wait, but AB is in F, so it's one of the lines, so the envelope is tangent to AB at the point where AB is tangent to the envelope. So, the point C is that point of tangency.

Wait, but earlier we were told that C is a point on AB that is not on any other PQ except AB. So, perhaps C is the point where AB is tangent to the envelope, so that no other PQ from F passes through C.

Therefore, to find point C, we can find where AB intersects the envelope. Since AB is a member of F, it must be tangent to the envelope at point C.

So, let's find the intersection of AB with the envelope.

AB is parametrized as:

X = (1 - t)/2,

Y = (sqrt(3) t ) / 2,

for t ∈ [0,1].

The envelope is given by:

X = x^3,

Y = (1 - x²)^(3/2).

So, we need to find x and t such that:

(1 - t)/2 = x^3,

and

(sqrt(3) t ) / 2 = (1 - x²)^(3/2).

So, we can set up these two equations:

1. (1 - t)/2 = x^3,

2. (sqrt(3) t ) / 2 = (1 - x²)^(3/2).

We can solve for t from equation 1:

1 - t = 2 x^3,

so,

t =1 - 2 x^3.

Then, substitute into equation 2:

sqrt(3)/2 * (1 - 2 x^3 ) = (1 - x²)^(3/2).

So, let me write:

sqrt(3)/2 (1 - 2 x^3 ) = (1 - x²)^(3/2).

Let me square both sides to eliminate the square roots:

(3/4) (1 - 2 x^3 )² = (1 - x²)^3.

Compute left side:

3/4 * (1 -4 x^3 +4 x^6 ) = 3/4 - 3 x^3 + 3 x^6.

Right side:

(1 - x²)^3 = 1 - 3x² + 3x^4 - x^6.

So, set equal:

3/4 - 3 x^3 + 3 x^6 = 1 - 3x² + 3x^4 - x^6.

Bring all terms to left:

3/4 -3x^3 +3x^6 -1 +3x² -3x^4 +x^6=0.

Simplify:

(3x^6 +x^6) + (-3x^4) + (-3x^3) + (3x²) + (3/4 -1 )=0.

Which is:

4x^6 -3x^4 -3x^3 +3x² -1/4=0.

Multiply all terms by 4 to eliminate fraction:

16x^6 -12x^4 -12x^3 +12x² -1=0.

So, we have a 6th-degree polynomial:

16x^6 -12x^4 -12x^3 +12x² -1 =0.

Hmm, solving a 6th-degree polynomial is pretty tough. Maybe we can factor this.

Let me try possible rational roots using Rational Root Theorem. Possible roots are ±1, ±1/2, ±1/4, ±1/8, ±1/16.

Let me test x=1:

16(1)^6 -12(1)^4 -12(1)^3 +12(1)^2 -1=16-12-12+12-1= (16-12)=4; (4-12)= -8; (-8+12)=4; (4-1)=3≠0.

x=1 is not a root.

x=1/2:

16*(1/2)^6 =16*(1/64)=1/4.

-12*(1/2)^4= -12*(1/16)= -3/4.

-12*(1/2)^3= -12*(1/8)= -3/2.

12*(1/2)^2=12*(1/4)=3.

-1.

So, total:

1/4 - 3/4 -3/2 +3 -1.

Compute step by step:

1/4 -3/4= -2/4= -1/2.

-1/2 -3/2= -2.

-2 +3=1.

1 -1=0.

So, x=1/2 is a root.

Therefore, (x -1/2) is a factor.

Let's perform polynomial division or use synthetic division.

Divide the polynomial by (x -1/2). Let me set up synthetic division.

We can write the polynomial as:

16x^6 +0x^5 -12x^4 -12x^3 +12x^2 +0x -1.

Using synthetic division with root 1/2.

Set up coefficients: 16, 0, -12, -12, 12, 0, -1.

Bring down 16.

Multiply by 1/2: 8.

Add to next coefficient: 0 +8=8.

Multiply by1/2:4.

Add to next: -12 +4=-8.

Multiply by1/2: -4.

Add to next: -12 + (-4)= -16.

Multiply by1/2: -8.

Add to next:12 + (-8)=4.

Multiply by1/2:2.

Add to next:0+2=2.

Multiply by1/2:1.

Add to last: -1 +1=0. Perfect, no remainder.

So, the polynomial factors as (x -1/2)(16x^5 +8x^4 -8x^3 -16x^2 +4x +2).

Now, let's try to factor the quintic: 16x^5 +8x^4 -8x^3 -16x^2 +4x +2.

Again, try rational roots. Possible roots are ±1, ±1/2, ±1/4, ±1/8, ±1/16, etc.

Test x= -1/2:

16*(-1/2)^5 +8*(-1/2)^4 -8*(-1/2)^3 -16*(-1/2)^2 +4*(-1/2)+2.

Compute each term:

16*(-1/32)= -0.5.

8*(1/16)=0.5.

-8*(-1/8)=1.

-16*(1/4)=-4.

4*(-1/2)=-2.

+2.

Sum all:

-0.5 +0.5=0; 0 +1=1; 1-4=-3; -3-2=-5; -5 +2= -3≠0.

Not a root.

Try x=1/2:

16*(1/2)^5 +8*(1/2)^4 -8*(1/2)^3 -16*(1/2)^2 +4*(1/2)+2.

Compute:

16*(1/32)=0.5.

8*(1/16)=0.5.

-8*(1/8)=-1.

-16*(1/4)=-4.

4*(1/2)=2.

+2.

Sum:

0.5 +0.5=1; 1-1=0; 0-4=-4; -4+2=-2; -2+2=0.

So, x=1/2 is a root again.

So, factor out (x -1/2).

Use synthetic division on the quintic: 16x^5 +8x^4 -8x^3 -16x^2 +4x +2.

Coefficients:16,8,-8,-16,4,2.

Divide by x=1/2.

Bring down 16.

Multiply by1/2:8.

Add to next:8+8=16.

Multiply by1/2:8.

Add to next: -8+8=0.

Multiply by1/2:0.

Add to next: -16 +0= -16.

Multiply by1/2: -8.

Add to next:4 + (-8)= -4.

Multiply by1/2: -2.

Add to last:2 + (-2)=0.

So, polynomial factors as (x -1/2)(16x^4 +16x^3 +0x^2 -16x -4).

So, now we have:

16x^6 -12x^4 -12x^3 +12x^2 -1 = (x -1/2)^2 (16x^4 +16x^3 -16x -4).

Now, let's factor the quartic:16x^4 +16x^3 -16x -4.

Factor out 4: 4(4x^4 +4x^3 -4x -1).

So, 4x^4 +4x^3 -4x -1.

Try to factor this quartic.

Perhaps factor as (ax^2 + bx +c)(dx^2 +ex +f).

Multiply out:

ad x^4 + (ae +bd)x^3 + (af +be +cd)x^2 + (bf +ce)x + cf.

We have 4x^4 +4x^3 +0x^2 -4x -1.

So, equate coefficients:

ad=4.

ae +bd=4.

af + be + cd=0.

bf + ce= -4.

cf= -1.

Looking for integer solutions.

Possible a and d: a=4, d=1; a=2, d=2; a=1, d=4.

Let me try a=2, d=2.

Then,

ae + bd=4 => 2e +2b=4 => e + b=2.

af + be +cd=0 => 2f +b e + 2c=0.

bf + ce= -4.

cf= -1.

We can have c=1, f=-1 or c=-1, f=1.

Try c=1, f=-1.

Then,

from bf + ce= -4: b*(-1) + e*(1)= -4 => -b + e= -4.

From e + b=2.

So,

-b + e= -4,

b + e=2.

Add the two equations:

(-b + e) + (b + e) = -4 +2 => 2e= -2 => e= -1.

Then, from b + e=2 => b=3.

Now, from af + be +cd=0: 2*(-1) +3*(-1) + 2*(1)= -2 -3 +2= -3 ≠0. Not good.

So, this choice doesn't work.

Try c=-1, f=1.

Then,

bf + ce= -4: b*(1) + e*(-1)= -4 => b -e= -4.

From e + b=2.

So,

b - e= -4,

b + e=2.

Add:

2b= -2 => b= -1.

Then, e=2 - b=2 - (-1)=3.

Now, check af + be +cd=0: 2*(1) + (-1)*3 +2*(-1)= 2 -3 -2= -3≠0. Doesn't work.

So, a=2, d=2 doesn't work.

Try a=4, d=1.

Then,

ae + bd=4: 4e +1*b=4.

af + be +cd=0:4f +b e +1*c=0.

bf + ce= -4.

cf= -1.

Possible c and f: c=1, f=-1 or c=-1, f=1.

Case 1: c=1, f=-1.

Then,

From ae + bd=4:4e +b=4.

From bf + ce= -4: b*(-1) + e*(1)= -4 => -b +e= -4.

So, we have:

4e +b=4,

e -b= -4.

Let me solve these equations:

From the second equation, e = b -4.

Substitute into first equation:

4*(b -4) +b=4 =>4b -16 +b=4 =>5b=20 =>b=4.

Then, e=4 -4=0.

Now, check af + be +cd=0:4*(-1) +4*0 +1*1= -4 +0 +1= -3≠0. Not good.

Case 2: c=-1, f=1.

Then,

From ae + bd=4:4e +b=4.

From bf + ce= -4: b*(1) + e*(-1)= -4 => b -e= -4.

So,

4e +b=4,

b -e= -4.

Let me solve:

From second equation, b= e -4.

Substitute into first:

4e + (e -4)=4 =>5e -4=4 =>5e=8 => e=8/5.

Then, b=8/5 -4= (8 -20)/5= -12/5.

But b and e must be integers? Wait, the original quartic is 4x^4 +4x^3 -4x -1. So, it's possible that the factors have fractional coefficients, but that complicates things. Alternatively, perhaps this approach isn't working.

Alternatively, perhaps try another approach.

Alternatively, perhaps the quartic can be factored as (x^2 + a x + b)(4x^2 +c x +d).

Multiply out:

x^2*(4x^2) +x^2*(c x) +x^2*d +a x*(4x^2) +a x*(c x) +a x*d +b*(4x^2) +b*(c x) +b*d.

Wait, no, correct expansion:

(x^2 + a x + b)(4x^2 +c x +d) =

x^2*4x^2 +x^2*c x +x^2*d + a x *4x^2 +a x *c x +a x *d +b*4x^2 +b*c x +b*d.

So,

4x^4 +c x^3 +d x^2 +4a x^3 +a c x^2 +a d x +4b x^2 +b c x +b d.

Combine like terms:

4x^4 + (c +4a) x^3 + (d + a c +4b) x^2 + (a d + b c) x + (b d).

Set equal to 4x^4 +4x^3 +0x^2 -4x -1.

So, equations:

1. 4x^4: matches.

2. c +4a =4.

3. d +a c +4b=0.

4. a d + b c= -4.

5. b d= -1.

So, from equation 5: b d= -1.

Possible integer solutions: b=1, d=-1 or b=-1, d=1.

Case 1: b=1, d=-1.

Equation 4: a*(-1) +1*c = -4 => -a +c= -4.

Equation 2: c +4a=4.

So,

From equation 4: c= a -4.

Substitute into equation 2:

(a -4) +4a=4 =>5a -4=4 =>5a=8 =>a=8/5. Not integer. Hmm, not ideal, but maybe possible.

Equation 3: d + a c +4b= -1 + a c +4=0.

So, a c= -3.

But from equation 4, c= a -4.

So, a(a -4)= -3.

Thus,

a² -4a +3=0.

Solve: a=(4 ±sqrt(16-12))/2=(4±2)/2=3 or 1.

So, a=3: Then c=3 -4=-1.

Check equation 3: a c=3*(-1)=-3, which fits.

So,

a=3, c=-1, b=1, d=-1.

So, the quartic factors as (x^2 +3x +1)(4x^2 -x -1).

Check: multiply (x² +3x +1)(4x² -x -1).

= x²*(4x² -x -1) +3x*(4x² -x -1) +1*(4x² -x -1).

=4x^4 -x^3 -x² +12x^3 -3x² -3x +4x² -x -1.

Combine like terms:

4x^4 + ( -x^3 +12x^3 ) + ( -x² -3x² +4x² ) + ( -3x -x ) + (-1).

=4x^4 +11x^3 +0x² -4x -1.

Wait, but our quartic is 4x^4 +4x^3 +0x^2 -4x -1. So, this doesn't match. Hmm, that suggests I made a mistake.

Wait, earlier we had:

Equation 3: d + a c +4b=0.

With d=-1, a=3, c=-1, b=1.

So,

-1 +3*(-1) +4*(1)= -1 -3 +4=0. Correct.

But when we multiply, we get 4x^4 +11x^3 -4x -1, which is not equal to the quartic 4x^4 +4x^3 -4x -1.

Hmm, so something's wrong. Maybe the factorization is incorrect.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the setup.

Wait, the quartic is 4x^4 +4x^3 -4x -1. When I factored as (x^2 +3x +1)(4x^2 -x -1), I get 4x^4 +11x^3 -4x -1. So, the x^3 term is off.

This suggests that perhaps the quartic isn't factorable this way. Maybe I need to try another approach.

Alternatively, perhaps use substitution. Let me set z=x +1/x or something.

Alternatively, perhaps using the substitution y =x -1/x. Hmm, not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps let me note that 4x^4 +4x^3 -4x -1 can be written as 4x^4 -4x +4x^3 -1.

Factor 4x(x^3 -1) + (4x^3 -1).

Hmm, not helpful.

Alternatively, perhaps factor by grouping:

(4x^4 +4x^3) + (-4x -1).

Factor 4x^3 from first two terms: 4x^3(x +1) - (4x +1).

Not helpful, since 4x +1 isn't a multiple of x+1.

Alternatively, perhaps try to factor as (x^3 + ...)(something). Not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps use the substitution t =x + something. Not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps use the quadratic formula on the quartic.

Wait, quartic equation: 4x^4 +4x^3 -4x -1=0.

Suppose we write it as 4x^4 +4x^3 -4x -1=0.

Maybe factor out x:

x(4x^3 +4x^2 -4) -1=0. Not helpful.

Alternatively, perhaps assume it factors into two quadratics as I did before, but maybe with different coefficients.

Wait, perhaps try another approach. Let me consider the quartic equation:

4x^4 +4x^3 -4x -1=0.

Let me make a substitution: let y=x +1/x. Hmm, not sure.

Alternatively, divide both sides by x^2:

4x^2 +4x -4/x -1/x^2=0.

Which is 4x^2 +4x -4/x -1/x^2=0.

Hmm, let me set z =x -1/x. Then, z² =x² -2 +1/x². So, x² +1/x² = z² +2.

Similarly, x +1/x = z.

Wait, not sure if that helps.

Alternatively, let me rearrange the equation:

4x^4 +4x^3 -4x -1=0.

Let me write it as 4x^4 -1 +4x^3 -4x=0.

Factor 4x^4 -1 as (2x² -1)(2x² +1).

And 4x^3 -4x=4x(x² -1)=4x(x-1)(x+1).

So, equation becomes:

(2x² -1)(2x² +1) +4x(x-1)(x+1)=0.

Not sure if helpful.

Alternatively, perhaps factor 4x^4 +4x^3 -4x -1.

Hmm, maybe it's (2x² + a x +b)(2x² +c x +d).

Multiply out:

2x²*2x²=4x^4.

2x²*(c x)=2c x^3.

2x²*d=2d x².

a x*2x²=2a x^3.

a x*c x=a c x².

a x*d=a d x.

b*2x²=2b x².

b*c x= b c x.

b*d= b d.

So, the terms:

4x^4 + (2c +2a) x^3 + (2d +a c +2b) x² + (a d +b c) x +b d.

Set equal to 4x^4 +4x^3 +0x^2 -4x -1.

Thus,

1. 4x^4: ok.

2. 2c +2a =4 ⇒c +a=2.

3. 2d +a c +2b=0.

4. a d +b c= -4.

5. b d= -1.

So, from equation5: possible (b,d)=(1,-1) or (-1,1).

Case1: b=1, d=-1.

Then, equation3: 2*(-1) +a c +2*1=0 ⇒-2 +a c +2=0 ⇒a c=0.

Equation2: c +a=2.

From a c=0:

Either a=0 or c=0.

If a=0, then c=2.

Then, equation4: a d +b c=0*(-1) +1*2=2≠-4. Not good.

If c=0, then a=2.

Equation4: a d +b c=2*(-1) +1*0= -2≠-4. Not good.

Case2: b=-1, d=1.

Equation3: 2*1 +a c +2*(-1)=0 ⇒2 +a c -2=0 ⇒a c=0.

Equation2: c +a=2.

If a=0, c=2.

Equation4: a d +b c=0*1 + (-1)*2=-2≠-4.

If c=0, a=2.

Equation4: a d +b c=2*1 + (-1)*0=2≠-4. Not good.

Hmm, so this approach doesn't yield a solution. Maybe the quartic doesn't factor into quadratics with integer coefficients. So, perhaps I need to use another method.

Alternatively, perhaps use substitution t=x + something.

Alternatively, perhaps solve quartic equation numerically.

Wait, but perhaps we can avoid solving the quartic exactly, since we already found that x=1/2 is a double root, so the other roots can be found, but it's complicated. Alternatively, perhaps since we're dealing with the envelope and the line AB, which is a PQ in F, the point of tangency is unique, so perhaps the point C is the only solution aside from the double root.

Wait, we initially found that x=1/2 is a root, which corresponds to the point B=(0, sqrt(3)/2), because when x=1/2, y= sqrt(1 - (1/2)^2 )=sqrt(3)/2. So, the point on the envelope is (x^3, y^3)= (1/8, (sqrt(3)/2)^3 )= (1/8, (3 sqrt(3))/8 ). But wait, point B is (0, sqrt(3)/2 ), which is not the same as (1/8, 3 sqrt(3)/8 ). So, perhaps the envelope is a different curve.

Wait, but when x=1/2, the envelope point is (1/8, 3 sqrt(3)/8 ), which is a point on AB?

Wait, AB is parametrized as ( (1 - t)/2, (sqrt(3) t )/2 ). Let me see if (1/8, 3 sqrt(3)/8 ) lies on AB.

Let’s set:

(1 - t)/2 =1/8 ⇒1 - t=1/4 ⇒t=3/4.

Then, y= (sqrt(3) * 3/4 ) /2= (3 sqrt(3))/8. So yes, it lies on AB at t=3/4.

So, the envelope and AB intersect at x=1/2 (which is point B) and at x=1/2 again (double root), but we also have another point at x=?

Wait, perhaps the envelope intersects AB at two points: x=1/2 (double root) and another point. But since the polynomial is degree 6, but we already factored out (x -1/2)^2, the remaining quartic may have other roots.

But perhaps the envelope touches AB at point C=(1/8, 3 sqrt(3)/8 ), which is the point of tangency, so that point is unique. So, perhaps this is the point C we're looking for.

Wait, but according to the previous calculation, when x=1/2, the envelope point is (1/8, 3 sqrt(3)/8 ), which is on AB at t=3/4. So, that's point C.

So, perhaps point C is (1/8, 3 sqrt(3)/8 ).

Thus, the coordinates of C are (1/8, 3 sqrt(3)/8 ).

Then, OC² is (1/8)^2 + (3 sqrt(3)/8 )^2=1/64 + 27/64=28/64=7/16.

So, OC²=7/16, so p=7, q=16, p+q=23.

Wait, but let me confirm if that's correct.

Wait, when x=1/2, the envelope point is (x^3, y^3 )=(1/8, (sqrt(3)/2 )^3 )=(1/8, (3 sqrt(3))/8 ). So, that's correct.

But earlier, we saw that when we set up the equations, t=3/4 gives that point.

So, point C is (1/8, 3 sqrt(3)/8 ), so OC²= (1/8)^2 + (3 sqrt(3)/8 )^2=1/64 + 27/64=28/64=7/16.

Which reduces to 7/16, so p=7, q=16, sum 23.

Therefore, the answer is 23.


To solve the problem, we analyze the family of segments \( \overline{PQ} \) of unit length in the first quadrant, where \( P \) is on the \( x \)-axis and \( Q \) is on the \( y \)-axis. Each segment \( \overline{PQ} \) can be described by the equation \( \frac{X}{x} + \frac{Y}{y} = 1 \) with \( x^2 + y^2 = 1 \).

The line segment \( \overline{AB} \) is part of this family, connecting \( A(\frac{1}{2}, 0) \) to \( B(0, \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}) \). We need to find a unique point \( C \) on \( \overline{AB} \) that does not lie on any other segment from \( \mathcal{F} \) except \( \overline{AB} \).

Parametrizing \( \overline{AB} \) as \( C(t) = \left( \frac{1 - t}{2}, \frac{\sqrt{3}t}{2} \right) \) for \( t \in [0, 1] \), we determine that \( C \) must lie on the envelope of the family \( \mathcal{F} \). The envelope is found to be the parametric curve \( X = x^3 \), \( Y = (1 - x^2)^{3/2} \).

By solving the system of equations derived from the envelope and the parametrization of \( \overline{AB} \), we find that the unique point \( C \) is \( \left( \frac{1}{8}, \frac{3\sqrt{3}}{8} \right) \). Calculating \( OC^2 \), we get:

\[
OC^2 = \left( \frac{1}{8} \right)^2 + \left( \frac{3\sqrt{3}}{8} \right)^2 = \frac{1}{64} + \frac{27}{64} = \frac{28}{64} = \frac{7}{16}.
\]

Thus, \( OC^2 = \frac{7}{16} \), leading to \( p = 7 \) and \( q = 16 \). Therefore, \( p + q = 23 \).

The final answer is \(\boxed{23}\).
