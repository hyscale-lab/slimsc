Okay, so I have this problem about a torus and a sphere. Let me try to visualize it. A torus is like a donut shape, right? It's formed by rotating a circle around an axis. In this case, the torus T has a circle with radius 3, and it's being revolved around an axis that's in the same plane as the circle, but 6 units away from the center of that circle. So the major radius (the distance from the center of the generating circle to the axis) is 6, and the minor radius (the radius of the generating circle) is 3.

Now, there's a sphere S with radius 11. The problem says when T rests on the inside of S, it's internally tangent along a circle with radius r_i, and when it rests on the outside, it's externally tangent along a circle with radius r_o. I need to find r_i - r_o and express it as a fraction m/n where m and n are coprime, then find m + n.

Hmm, okay. So I think I need to figure out the circles of tangency for both internal and external tangents between the torus and the sphere.

Let me start by recalling some properties of tori and spheres. The equation of a torus in 3D can be written as (sqrt(x^2 + y^2) - R)^2 + z^2 = r^2, where R is the major radius and r is the minor radius. In this case, R is 6 and r is 3.

And the sphere S has a radius of 11, so its equation is x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = 11^2 = 121.

When the torus is inside the sphere and tangent, their surfaces touch along a circle. Similarly, when the torus is outside and tangent, they touch along another circle. The radii of these circles of tangency are r_i and r_o, respectively.

I think the key here is to find the points where the torus and sphere are tangent and then find the radius of that circle.

Let me think about the internal tangent case first. When the torus is inside the sphere, the closest point on the torus to the center of the sphere (which is also the center of the sphere) is the center of the generating circle, right? Because the torus is symmetric around the axis, and the sphere is centered at the same point.

Wait, is the center of the torus the same as the center of the sphere? I think so because the torus is generated by revolving around an axis in its own plane, which is at a distance 6 from its center. So the center of the torus (the center of the generating circle) is 6 units away from the axis, but if the sphere is centered at the same point as the generating circle's center, then the distance from the sphere's center to the axis is 6. Hmm, maybe I need to clarify this.

Wait, no, the axis is in the plane of the generating circle, and the generating circle is at a distance 6 from the axis. So the generating circle's center is 6 units away from the axis. But if the sphere is centered at the generating circle's center, then the distance from the sphere's center to the axis is 6. So when the torus is inside the sphere, the sphere's radius is 11, and the torus is inside, touching along a circle.

I think I need to model this in coordinates. Let me set up a coordinate system where the center of the generating circle of the torus is at the origin (0,0,0). The axis of revolution is along the z-axis, but wait, no, the axis is in the plane of the circle. So perhaps the generating circle is in the x-y plane, and the axis is, say, along the x-axis. So the generating circle is centered at (6,0,0), and has radius 3. When we revolve it around the x-axis, we get the torus.

Wait, that makes
