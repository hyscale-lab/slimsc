Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the remainder when the product from k=0 to 12 of (2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k}) is divided by 1000. Here, ω is a 13th root of unity, and ω isn't equal to 1. Hmm, that sounds a bit intimidating, but let me break it down step by step.

First, I remember that the 13th roots of unity are solutions to the equation x^13 = 1. So, ω is one of those roots, except for 1. Each ω^k for k from 0 to 12 will give me all the distinct roots. So, when k=0, ω^0 is 1, but since ω ≠ 1, maybe k starts from 1? Wait, no, the product is from k=0 to 12, so it includes k=0. But when k=0, ω^0 is 1, so the term becomes (2 - 2*1 + 1^2) which is (2 - 2 + 1) = 1. So, that first term is 1, which is fine. The rest are from k=1 to 12, which are the non-1 roots.

Now, looking at the expression inside the product: 2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k}. Let me write that as 2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k}. Hmm, maybe I can factor this or find a pattern.

Wait, ω^{2k} is the same as (ω^k)^2, right? So, perhaps I can let x = ω^k and rewrite the expression as 2 - 2x + x². Let me see: x² - 2x + 2. Hmm, that's a quadratic in x. Maybe I can factor it or find its roots?

Let me compute the discriminant: D = (−2)^2 − 4*1*2 = 4 - 8 = -4. So, the roots are (2 ± sqrt(-4))/2 = 1 ± i. So, the quadratic factors as (x - (1 + i))(x - (1 - i)). So, 2 - 2x + x² = (x - (1 + i))(x - (1 - i)). 

So, each term in the product is (x - (1 + i))(x - (1 - i)), where x = ω^k. Therefore, the entire product from k=0 to 12 is the product over k=0 to 12 of (ω^k - (1 + i))(ω^k - (1 - i)).

Hmm, interesting. So, that's the product of (ω^k - (1 + i)) times (ω^k - (1 - i)) for k from 0 to 12. Since ω^k are all the 13th roots of unity, maybe I can relate this product to cyclotomic polynomials or something like that.

Wait, I remember that for a polynomial f(x), the product of (x - ω^k) for k=0 to 12 is x^13 - 1, because the roots are the 13th roots of unity. But in this case, we're evaluating at x = 1 + i and x = 1 - i, but multiplied together.

Wait, let's think. The product over k=0 to 12 of (x - ω^k) is x^13 - 1. So, if I take x = 1 + i, then the product becomes (1 + i)^13 - 1. Similarly for x = 1 - i, it's (1 - i)^13 - 1.

So, the product we have is [ (1 + i)^13 - 1 ] * [
