Okay, so I have this tetrahedron ABCD with specific edge lengths, and I need to find the distance from the incenter (the point equidistant from all faces) to each face. The answer needs to be in the form m√n / p, and then find m + n + p. Alright, let's break this down.

First, let me note down the given edge lengths:

- AB = CD = √41
- AC = BD = √80
- BC = AD = √89

Hmm, interesting. So opposite edges are equal. That seems symmetrical. Maybe the tetrahedron is "isohedral" or something? Not sure, but maybe that symmetry can help.

I remember that in a tetrahedron, the inradius (the distance from the incenter to each face) can be found using the formula:

r = (3V) / S

Where V is the volume of the tetrahedron, and S is the total surface area (sum of the areas of all four faces).

So my plan is to compute the volume V and the total surface area S, then plug into this formula to get r.

Let me start by finding the volume V.

But wait, calculating the volume of a tetrahedron with given edge lengths isn't straightforward. I think I need to use coordinates or maybe some formula that relates edge lengths to volume.

Wait, I recall that for a tetrahedron with all opposite edges equal, it's called a disphenoid. So this is a disphenoid, which has some nice properties. I think in a disphenoid, the volume can be calculated using the formula:

V = (sqrt( (a² + b² - c²)(a² + b² + c²) )) / 72

Wait, no, maybe that's not the exact formula. Maybe it's better to assign coordinates to the vertices and compute the volume using the scalar triple product.

Yes, that might be more reliable. Let me try that approach.

Since the tetrahedron is symmetric, maybe I can place it in a coordinate system such that the coordinates are symmetric as well.

Let me denote the points as A, B, C, D.

Given that AB = CD = √41, AC = BD = √80, and BC = AD = √89.

I think choosing a coordinate
