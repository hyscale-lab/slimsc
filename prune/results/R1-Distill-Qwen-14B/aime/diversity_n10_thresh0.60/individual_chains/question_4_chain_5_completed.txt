Okay, so I've got this problem where Alice and Bob are playing a game with a stack of n tokens. They take turns removing either 1 or 4 tokens each time, and the person who takes the last token wins. I need to figure out how many positive integers n ≤ 2024 allow Bob to have a winning strategy, regardless of how Alice plays.

Hmm, let's start by understanding the game mechanics. It's a turn-based game with two possible moves each turn: remove 1 or 4 tokens. The goal is to be the one to take the last token. So, it's a classic combinatorial game, and I think I can analyze it using the concept of winning and losing positions.

A winning position is one where the current player can force a win no matter what the opponent does. Conversely, a losing position is where no matter what the current player does, the opponent can force a win.

Since Alice goes first, if the starting position (n tokens) is a losing position for Alice, then Bob can win. So, I need to find all n ≤ 2024 where n is a losing position for the first player (Alice), meaning Bob can win.

Let me try to model this. I'll create a sequence where each term represents whether the position is a winning (W) or losing (L) position for the player whose turn it is.

Let's start from the base case. If n=0, the game is over, so the player who just moved wins. Therefore, n=0 is a losing position for the current player because they can't make a move. Wait, no—if it's your turn and there are no tokens left, you lose because you can't make a move. So, n=0 is a losing position for the player about to move.

Wait, actually, in standard game theory, positions where the player to move cannot win are losing positions. So, n=0 is a losing position because the player cannot move, thereby losing the game.

Now, building up from n=0:

- n=1: The player can take 1 token and win. So, W.
- n=2: The player can take 1 token, leaving n=1 for the opponent, who can then win by taking it. Wait, that's bad. Alternatively, the player could take 4 tokens, but that's impossible here. So, the player can only take 1, leaving n=1, which is a winning position for the opponent. So, n=2 would be a losing position? Wait, no. Wait, if I leave the opponent in a winning position, that doesn't mean the current position is a losing one. Let me think again.

Wait, no. Let me think in terms of Grundy numbers or using the concept of mex (minimum excludant). Alternatively, maybe I can model this recursively.

Let me define f(n) as true if the current player can force a win from n tokens, and false otherwise.

Base case:
f(0) = false (no tokens, can't move, lose)

For n ≥ 1:
f(n) = (f(n-1) is false) OR (f(n-4) is false)
Because the current player can choose to take 1 or 4 tokens. So, if either move leads to the opponent being in a losing position, then the current position is a winning one.

Wait, no. Wait, in combinatorial game theory, if from a position, you can make at least one move that forces the opponent into a losing position, then your current position is a winning position. Otherwise, it's a losing position.

So, f(n) is true if either f(n-1) is false or f(n-4) is false. If both f(n-1) and f(n-4) are true, then f(n) is false.

Wait, let's test this with small n.

n=0: f(0)=false (losing)
n=1: can take 1, leading to n=0 (which is losing for opponent), so f(1)=true (winning)
n=2: can take 1, leading to n=1 (which is winning for opponent), or take 4 (not possible). So, since taking 1 leads to opponent's win, but taking 4 isn't possible, so f(2)=false (losing)
Wait, is that right? Because the player at n=2 can take 1 token, leaving n=1 for the opponent. The opponent can then take 1 and win, so the player at n=2 can't force a win. So, f(2)=false. That seems correct.

n=3: The player can take 1, leading to n=2 (losing for opponent). So, f(3)=true.
n=4: The player can take 1, leading to n=3 (winning for opponent), or take 4, leading to n=0 (losing for opponent). So, since taking 4 leads to opponent's loss, f(4)=true.
n=5: The player can take 1, leading to n=4 (winning for opponent), or take 4, leading to n=1 (winning for opponent). So, both moves lead to opponent's win. So, f(5)=false.
n=6: Take 1 to n=5 (losing for opponent) → so f(6)=true.
n=7: Take 1 to n=6 (winning for opponent), or take 4 to n=3 (winning for opponent). So, both lead to opponent's win, so f(7)=false.
n=8: Take 1 to n=7 (losing for opponent) → so f(8)=true.
n=9: Take 1 to n=8 (winning for opponent), or take 4 to n=5 (losing for opponent). So, by taking 4, opponent is left with n=5, which is a losing position. So, f(9)=true.
Wait, that's inconsistent with initial pattern. Let me recheck.

Wait, for n=5, f(5)=false. So, if at n=9, taking 4 tokens leads to n=5, which is a losing position for the opponent. So, the current player can win by taking 4, so f(9)=true.

n=10: Take 1 to n=9 (winning for opponent), or take 4 to n=6 (winning for opponent). So, both moves leave opponent in a winning position. Thus, f(10)=false.
Wait, but let me check n=6: f(6)=true. So, if I take 4 from n=10, I get n=6, which is a winning position for the opponent. So, both options leave opponent in a winning position. Thus, f(10)=false.

Wait, so let's list f(n) from n=0 to, say, 10:

n | f(n)
--- | ---
0 | F
1 | T
2 | F
3 | T
4 | T
5 | F
6 | T
7 | F
8 | T
9 | T
10| F

Hmm, so the pattern seems to be every 5 steps, starting from n=0, F, T, F, T, T, then F, T, F, T, T, etc. Let me check n=11:

n=11: Can take 1 to n=10 (F), so f(11)=T.

n=12: Take 1 to n=11 (T), or 4 to n=8 (T). So, both moves leave opponent in a winning position. Thus, f(12)=F.

n=13: Take 1 to n=12 (F) → f(13)=T.

n=14: Take 1 to n=13 (T), or 4 to n=10 (F). So, taking 4 tokens leaves opponent at n=10 (F), so current player can win. Thus, f(14)=T.

n=15: Take 1 to n=14 (T), or 4 to n=11 (T). Both moves leave opponent in a winning position. So, f(15)=F.

So, the pattern up to n=15 is:

n | f(n)
0 | F
1 | T
2 | F
3 | T
4 | T
5 | F
6 | T
7 | F
8 | T
9 | T
10| F
11| T
12| F
13| T
14| T
15| F

So, the losing positions (F) are at n=0, 2,5,7,10,12,15,... It looks like the losing positions are every 5 steps after n=0, starting at n=2.

Wait, let's see:

From n=0, the next losing position is 2, then 5, then 7, then 10, 12, 15, etc. So, perhaps the losing positions follow a pattern where they are every 5 steps but starting after 0.

Wait, let me see the differences between the losing positions:

0, 2,5,7,10,12,15,17,20,...

Differences between consecutive terms:

2-0=2

5-2=3

7-5=2

10-7=3

12-10=2

15-12=3

17-15=2

20-17=3

So, the pattern alternates between adding 2 and 3. Hmm. So, the losing positions are built by alternately adding 2 and 3 each time.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a cycle of 5, with two losing positions every 5. Wait, looking at the initial sequence:

n=0: F

n=1: T

n=2: F

n=3: T

n=4: T

n=5: F

n=6: T

n=7: F

n=8: T

n=9: T

n=10: F

So, the losing positions are at 0,2,5,7,10,12,15,17,20,22,25,...

So, it's every 5 steps, but in each block of 5, the losing positions are at positions 2 and 5 mod 5? Wait, 0 mod 5 is 0, which is a losing position.

Wait, maybe it's better to model the losing positions as numbers congruent to 0 mod 5, 2 mod 5, or 5 mod 5? Wait, 5 mod 5 is 0.

Wait, perhaps the losing positions are numbers where n mod 5 is 0 or 2?

Wait, checking n=0: 0 mod5=0 → losing.

n=2: 2 mod5=2 → losing.

n=5: 5 mod5=0 → losing.

n=7: 7 mod5=2 → losing.

n=10:10 mod5=0 → losing.

n=12:12 mod5=2 → losing.

n=15:15 mod5=0 → losing.

n=17:17 mod5=2 → losing.

Yes, this seems to fit. So, the losing positions are those n where n mod5 is 0 or 2.

Wait, but wait, n=0 is a losing position, as the player can't move. But in our problem, n starts from 1, so the losing positions for the starting player (Alice) would be n where n ≡ 0 or 2 mod 5.

Wait, let's test n=5: Alice can take 1, leaving n=4 for Bob. If Bob is at n=4, he can take 4 tokens and win. So, Alice would lose if she takes 1. Alternatively, if Alice takes 4 from n=5, she leaves n=1 for Bob, who then takes 1 and wins. So, Alice can't force a win from n=5. Hence, n=5 is losing for Alice, which matches our earlier analysis.

Similarly, n=2: Alice takes 1, leaving n=1 for Bob, who takes it and wins. So, n=2 is a losing position for Alice.

Similarly, n=7: Alice can take 1, leaving n=6. Bob can take 1, leaving n=5, which is a losing position for Alice, so Bob can win. Alternatively, Alice takes 4, leaving n=3, which is a winning position for Bob (he can take 1 and leave n=2, which is a losing position for Alice). So, n=7 is a losing position for Alice.

So, if the losing positions are n where n mod5 is 0 or 2, then the number of such n up to 2024 is the count of numbers ≤2024 where n ≡0 or 2 mod5.

So, to compute this, I can find how many numbers ≤2024 are ≡0 mod5, and how many are ≡2 mod5, then sum them.

First, for n≡0 mod5:

The numbers are 5,10,15,..., up to the maximum ≤2024.

The maximum multiple of 5 ≤2024 is 2020, since 2024 ÷5=404.8, so 404*5=2020.

So, the count is 2020 /5 = 404 numbers.

Similarly, for n≡2 mod5:

The numbers are 2,7,12,..., up to ≤2024.

The sequence starts at 2, and each term is 5 more than the previous. So, the nth term is 2 +5(k-1) = 5k -3.

We need 5k -3 ≤2024 →5k ≤2027 →k ≤2027/5=405.4, so k=405. So, the last term is 5*405 -3=2025-3=2022.

So, the count is 405 numbers.

So, total losing positions for Alice (Bob can win) are 404 +405=809.

Wait, but let me check for n=2024.

What is 2024 mod5?

2024 ÷5=404 *5=2020, so 2024=2020+4 →2024 mod5=4. So, 2024 is not a losing position.

Wait, but the count for n≡2 mod5 up to 2024: the last term is 2022, which is ≤2024. So, 405 terms.

Similarly, for n≡0 mod5, up to 2020, which is 404 terms.

So, total is 404 +405=809.

Wait, but let me make sure that the sequence for n≡2 mod5 doesn't include any number beyond 2024. The last term is 2022, which is fine.

So, the number of n ≤2024 where n ≡0 or 2 mod5 is 809.

Wait, but wait. Let me recount:

For n≡0 mod5: numbers are 5,10,...,2020 → total terms: (2020-5)/5 +1 = (2015)/5 +1=403 +1=404. Correct.

For n≡2 mod5: numbers are 2,7,...,2022.

How many terms? The nth term is 2 +5(k-1) =5k -3.

Set 5k -3 ≤2024 →5k ≤2027 →k ≤405.4, so k=405.

Thus, 405 terms.

So, total is 404+405=809.

So, the answer should be 809.

Wait, but let me check with n=5,10, etc., to make sure.

Wait, for n=5: f(5)=F, correct.

n=7: f(7)=F, correct.

n=10: f(10)=F, correct.

n=12: f(12)=F.

n=15: F.

Yes, seems consistent.

So, the number of positive integers n ≤2024 where Bob can force a win is 809.

Wait, but another way to think about it: in each block of 5 numbers, there are exactly two losing positions: one at 0 mod5 and one at 2 mod5. So, for every 5 numbers, 2 are losing positions.

So, the total number of losing positions up to N is floor(N/5)*2 + extra if there are any numbers beyond the last multiple of 5.

Wait, but in this case, up to 2024, which is 2024=5*404 +4.

So, the number of complete blocks is 404, each contributing 2 losing positions, so 404*2=808.

Now, in the incomplete block from 2021 to 2024: 2021,2022,2023,2024.

Check which of these are losing positions.

2021 mod5: 2020 is 5*404, so 2021 mod5=1 → not a losing position.

2022 mod5=2 → losing position.

2023 mod5=3 → not losing.

2024 mod5=4 → not losing.

So, in the incomplete block, only 2022 is a losing position. So, add 1.

Thus, total losing positions: 404*2 +1=808+1=809.

Yes, that matches. So, the answer is 809.


Alice and Bob play a game where they take turns removing 1 or 4 tokens from a stack of $n$ tokens, with Alice going first. The player who removes the last token wins. To determine the number of $n \leq 2024$ where Bob can guarantee a win, we analyze the game using winning and losing positions.

A losing position is one where the current player cannot force a win, regardless of the opponent's moves. By examining small values of $n$, we identify a pattern: losing positions occur at $n \equiv 0 \pmod{5}$ and $n \equiv 2 \pmod{5}$. 

To find the total number of such $n$ up to 2024:
1. Count numbers $\equiv 0 \pmod{5}$: These are 5, 10, ..., 2020, totaling 404 numbers.
2. Count numbers $\equiv 2 \pmod{5}$: These are 2, 7, ..., 2022, totaling 405 numbers.

Adding these gives $404 + 405 = 809$ losing positions where Bob can force a win.

Thus, the number of positive integers $n \leq 2024$ where Bob has a winning strategy is:

\boxed{809}
