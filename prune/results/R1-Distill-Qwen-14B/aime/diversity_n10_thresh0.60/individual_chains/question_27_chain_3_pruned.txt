Okay, so I have this problem about a torus and a sphere. Let me try to visualize it. The torus is like a donut shape, right? It's created by revolving a circle of radius 3 around an axis that's in the same plane as the circle and is 6 units away from the center. So, the distance from the center of the original circle to the axis is 6, and the radius of the circle being revolved is 3. 

Now, there's a sphere with radius 11. The torus can rest on the inside of this sphere and be internally tangent along a circle with radius r_i, and it can also rest on the outside, being externally tangent along a circle with radius r_o. The question is asking for the difference r_i - r_o, which can be expressed as a fraction m/n where m and n are coprime. Then, I need to find m + n.

Hmm, okay. So, I think I need to first understand what the torus looks like in 3D space. A torus can be described in terms of two radii: the major radius R, which is the distance from the center of the generating circle to the axis of revolution, and the minor radius r, which is the radius of the generating circle. In this case, R would be 6 and r would be 3, right?

Wait, the problem says the circle has radius 3, and it's revolved around an axis 6 units away. So yeah, R = 6 and r = 3. So, the torus equation in 3D coordinates can be given by (sqrt(x^2 + y^2) - R)^2 + z^2 = r^2. But maybe I don't need the equation right now.

The sphere has radius 11. When the torus is inside the sphere, they are tangent along a circle. Similarly, when the torus is outside, they are tangent along another circle. The radii of these circles are r_i and r_o, respectively, and I need to find their difference.

I think I should consider the centers of these tangent circles. When the torus is inside the sphere, the sphere's center is at some point, and the torus is nestled inside it. The point of tangency would be along a circle where both the sphere and the torus touch each other exactly at that circle.

Wait, maybe I should think about the geometry of the situation. Let's model the sphere as centered at the origin (0,0,0). The torus is also centered at the origin, I suppose, because when it's resting on the inside or outside, it's symmetric.

So, when the torus is inside the sphere, the sphere has a larger radius, so the point of tangency would be where the torus is closest to the sphere's surface. Similarly, when the torus is outside, the point of tangency is where they just touch each other externally.

Let me think about the points of tangency. For the internal tangent, the sphere and torus touch along a circle where their surfaces are just barely in contact. I need to find the radius of that circle in both cases.

Maybe I can model this using the distance between the centers of the sphere and the torus. Wait, no, both are centered at the origin, right? So, the centers are the same.

Wait, that can't be. Because if the torus is inside the sphere, it's not just the centers that matter. The torus has a circular cross-section, so when it's inside the sphere, the sphere's radius is larger, and the torus is entirely inside except for the tangent circle. Similarly, when it's outside, the sphere is inside the torus, touching along a circle.

Alternatively, perhaps the torus can be thought of as a surface where every point is at a distance R from the central axis, and each point is also at a distance r from the center of the tube.

Wait, maybe I should think in terms of the sphere and torus centers. But I'm getting confused. Wait, the sphere is centered at the origin, and the torus is also centered at the origin, correct? Because when it's resting on the inside or outside, it's symmetric.

So, when the torus is inside the sphere, the sphere has radius 11, and the torus is inside. The closest points on the torus to the center (origin) would be along the axis of the torus's generating circle. So, the distance from the center to the closest point on the torus would be R - r = 6 - 3 = 3. That makes sense because the center of the generating circle is 6 units away, and the generating circle has radius 3, so the closest point is 3 units from the origin.

Similarly, the farthest point on the torus from the origin would be R + r = 9 units. But the sphere has a radius of 11, so that's much larger. So,
