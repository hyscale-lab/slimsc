Okay, so I've got this logarithm problem here. It says that there are real numbers x and y, both greater than 1, such that log base x of y^x equals 10, and log base y of x^{4y} also equals 10. I need to find the product xy. Hmm, logarithms can sometimes be tricky, but let's try to break this down step by step.

First, let me write down the given equations to get a clear picture. 

The first equation is log_x(y^x) = 10. The second equation is log_y(x^{4y}) = 10.

I remember some logarithm properties that might help here. One of them is that log_b(a^k) = k * log_b(a). So maybe I can apply that to both equations.

Starting with the first equation: log_x(y^x) = 10. Applying the power rule, this becomes x * log_x(y) = 10. So, x times log base x of y equals 10. Let me write that down:

x * log_x(y) = 10.

Now, I also recall that log_b(a) is equal to 1 / log_a(b). That's the change of base reciprocal property. So, log_x(y) is 1 / log_y(x). Let me denote log_y(x) as some variable to simplify. Let me say letâ€™s let a = log_y(x). Then, log_x(y) would be 1/a.

So substituting back into the first equation, I get x * (1/a) = 10. So, x/a = 10, which implies that x = 10a.

Okay, now let's look at the second equation: log_y(x^{4y}) = 10. Again, applying the power rule, this becomes 4y * log_y(x) = 10. So 4y * a = 10, since a is log_y(x).

So, 4y * a = 10. Let's write that as equation (2): 4y * a = 10.

From the first equation, we have x = 10a. Let me note that as equation (1): x = 10a.

Now, I need to find another equation or a way to relate x and y. Since I have x expressed in terms of a, and I have another equation involving y and a, maybe I can solve for a first.

So, from equation (2): 4y * a = 10. Let's solve for y in terms of a.

Divide both sides by 4a: y = 10 / (4a) = 5/(2a). So, y = 5/(2a). Let me call that equation (3): y = 5/(2a).

Now, remember that a is log_y(x). So, a = log_y(x). Which, by definition, means that y^a = x. So, x = y^a.

But from equation (1), we have x = 10a. So, setting these equal: y^a = 10a.

From equation (3), y is 5/(2a). So, substitute that into this equation: (5/(2a))^a = 10a.

Hmm, that looks a bit complicated, but maybe I can take the natural logarithm of both sides to simplify.

Taking ln on both sides: ln[(5/(2a))^a] = ln(10a).

Using the power rule again on the left side: a * ln(5/(2a)) = ln(10a).

Let me expand that: a [ ln(5) - ln(2a) ] = ln(10) + ln(a).

So, a ln(5) - a ln(2a) = ln(10) + ln(a).

Hmm, maybe I can express a ln(2a) as a (ln 2 + ln a). So, a ln(2a) = a ln 2 + a ln a.

Substituting back, the equation becomes:

a ln(5) - [a ln 2 + a ln a] = ln(10) + ln(a).

Let me distribute the negative sign: a ln5 - a ln2 - a ln a = ln10 + ln a.

I can factor out a from the left side: a (ln5 - ln2 - ln a) = ln10 + ln a.

Wait, let me compute ln5 - ln2. That's ln(5/2). So, a (ln(5/2) - ln a) = ln(10) + ln a.

Hmm, perhaps I can rearrange this equation. Let me bring all terms to one side:

a (ln(5/2) - ln a) - ln(10) - ln a = 0.

Expanding this: a ln(5/2) - a ln a - ln(10) - ln a = 0.

Combine like terms. The terms with ln a are -a ln a - ln a, which can be factored as - ln a (a + 1).

So now, the equation is: a ln(5/2) - ln a (a + 1) - ln(10) = 0.

Hmm, this is getting a bit messy. Maybe I can factor out ln a or something. Alternatively, perhaps I should try to find a substitution or set t = ln a or something like that.

Let me let t = ln a. Then, a = e^t. Let's substitute that into the equation.

So, the equation becomes:

e^t * ln(5/2) - t (e^t + 1) - ln(10) = 0.

Wait, that might not simplify things much. Alternatively, perhaps I can see if a has a nice value. Let's think numerically.

Wait, let me check if a is an integer or a simple fraction. Let me try a = 1. Then, let's see if that works.

If a = 1, then from equation (1), x = 10*1 = 10.

From equation (3), y = 5/(2*1) = 5/2 = 2.5.

Then, we can check if a = log_y(x) is indeed 1.

Compute log_{2.5}(10): Is that 1? Well, 2.5^1 = 2.
