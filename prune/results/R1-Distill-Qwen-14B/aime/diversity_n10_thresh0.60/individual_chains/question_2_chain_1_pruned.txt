Okay, so I have this problem here with points O, A, and B. O is at (0,0), A is at (1/2, 0), and B is at (0, sqrt(3)/2). They form a segment AB, and there's a family of segments PQ. Each PQ is a unit length segment in the first quadrant, with P on the x-axis and Q on the y-axis. So, each PQ is a line segment starting on the x-axis at some point P, going to the y-axis at some point Q, and the length of PQ is 1.

The question is about a unique point C on AB, not A or B, that doesn't lie on any other segment from this family F except AB itself. Then, we need to find OC squared, expressed as a fraction p/q where p and q are coprime, and then give p + q.

Hmm, okay. Let me try to visualize this. So, O is the origin, A is halfway between O and (1,0), and B is a bit higher on the y-axis, since sqrt(3)/2 is approximately 0.866. So, AB connects (1/2, 0) to (0, sqrt(3)/2). That should form a line segment. The family F consists of these PQ segments of length 1 in the first quadrant.

I think each PQ can be parameterized by some variable. Let me think about how to represent these PQ segments. Let's say P is at (t, 0) on the x-axis and Q is at (0, s) on the y-axis. The length of PQ is 1, so the distance between (t, 0) and (0, s) is sqrt(t^2 + s^2) = 1. So, t^2 + s^2 = 1. Therefore, for each t between 0 and 1, s would be sqrt(1 - t^2), and vice versa.

So, each PQ is the line segment connecting (t, 0) to (0, sqrt(1 - t^2)), for t in [0,1]. So, the family F consists of all such segments.

Now, we're looking for a point C on AB such that C is not on any other segment from F except AB itself. So, AB is one of these PQ segments? Wait, let me check. Let me see if AB is a segment in F.

Point A is (1/2, 0), so t = 1/2. Then, s should be sqrt(1 - (1/2)^2) = sqrt(3/4) = sqrt(3)/2. Which is exactly where B is. So, AB is one of these segments PQ in F. So, AB is a member of F.

So, for point C on AB, it's on AB which is in F. But we need C to not lie on any other segment from F. So, C is only on AB and no other PQ in F.

So, we need to find such a point C on AB. Then, we have to find OC squared.

Okay, so perhaps the point C is where AB is tangent to some envelope of the family F. Because the envelope of a family of curves is a curve that is tangent to each member of the family at some point. But in this case, F is a family of line segments, not curves, but maybe the envelope concept still applies in some way.

Wait, alternatively, maybe it's the point where AB is the only segment in F that passes through C. So, for all other segments in F, they don't pass through C. So, C is unique in that sense.

So, perhaps C is the point where AB is the only PQ segment that passes through it, and all other PQ segments don't intersect AB at C.

Wait, but AB is a PQ segment itself. So, any point on AB is on PQ AB. But for other PQ segments, they might intersect AB at some other points.

But the problem says that C is on AB, and no other PQ in F passes through C. So, C is only on AB, not on any other segments from F.

Hmm, so perhaps C is a point where AB is the only PQ segment containing C. So, to find such a point, maybe we can find the point on AB that is only on AB and no other PQ.

So, perhaps the way to approach this is to parametrize AB, find the equation of AB, and then determine for a general point on AB, whether it lies on any other PQ segment from F.

So, let me parametrize AB. Let me find the equation of line AB.

Point A is (1/2, 0), and point B is (0, sqrt(3)/2). So, the slope of AB is (sqrt(3)/2 - 0)/(0 - 1/2) = (sqrt(3)/2) / (-1/2) = -sqrt(3). So, slope m = -sqrt(3).

So, the equation of AB can be written as y = -sqrt(3)(x - 1/2). Because when x = 1/2, y = 0. Alternatively, y = -sqrt(3)x + sqrt(3)/2.

Yes, that's the equation of AB.

So, any point C on AB can be written as (x, y) where y = -sqrt(3)x + sqrt(3)/2.

Now, suppose that a point C = (x, y) lies on another segment PQ in F. So, PQ is a segment from (t, 0) to (0, s), with t^2 + s^2 = 1, and s = sqrt(1 - t^2).

We need to find if there's another t (other than t = 1/2) such that C lies on PQ.

So, the segment PQ connects (t,0) to (0, s). The parametric equation for PQ can be written as:

For parameter k from 0 to 1,

x = t(1 - k)
y = s k

So, for some k in [0, 1], (x, y) is on PQ.

So, if (x, y) is on AB, then y = -sqrt(3)x + sqrt(3)/2.

But if it's also on PQ, then y = (s / t) x, because the line PQ has slope -s/t. Wait, no:

Wait, the line PQ goes from (t, 0) to (0, s), so the slope is (s - 0)/(0 - t) = -s/t.

So, the equation of PQ is y = (-s/t)x + s.

So, the point (x, y) lies on PQ, so y = (-s/t)x + s.

And it must also lie on AB, so y = -sqrt(3)x + sqrt(3)/2.

Therefore, equating the two expressions:

(-s/t)x + s = -sqrt(3)x + sqrt(3)/2.

Let me rearrange this:

[(-s/t) + sqrt(3)]x + (s - sqrt(
