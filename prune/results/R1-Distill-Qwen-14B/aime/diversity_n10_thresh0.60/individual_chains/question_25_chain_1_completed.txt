Okay, so I've got this problem here about residents in Aimeville and the things they own. Let me try to parse this step by step.

First, the total number of residents is 900. Each of them owns a bag of candy hearts. So that's a given. Then, there are three other items: diamond rings, golf clubs, and garden spades. The numbers are 195 owning a diamond ring, 367 owning golf clubs, and 562 owning a garden spade.

Now, the problem also states that 437 residents own exactly two of these things, and 234 own exactly three of them. The question is asking how many own all four—so that's the candy hearts plus the other three.

Hmm, okay. So it's a problem about sets and their intersections. I remember something about inclusion-exclusion principles here. Let me try to recall how that works.

Inclusion-exclusion is a principle that helps calculate the size of the union of multiple sets by adding the sizes of individual sets, subtracting the sizes of all possible two-set intersections, adding back in the sizes of all possible three-set intersections, and so on. But wait, in this problem, we aren't directly given the sizes of the intersections, but instead, we know how many people own exactly two or exactly three items.

Let me think. So, each resident owns at least the candy hearts. So, the candy hearts are like a universal set here because everyone has them. So, the other three items are subsets of this universal set.

Let me denote:

- D = set of people owning a diamond ring
- G = set of people owning golf clubs
- S = set of people owning a garden spade
- C = set of people owning candy hearts (which is everyone, so |C|=900)

We are to find |D ∩ G ∩ S ∩ C|, but since C includes everyone, this is the same as |D ∩ G ∩ S|.

Wait, but all the other sets are subsets of C, so the intersection of all four is the same as the intersection of the first three.

But maybe it's easier to model this with the Venn diagram approach, considering all four sets. But since everyone has C, perhaps focusing on the other three is better.

Wait, but the problem is about four items: D, G, S, and C. But since C is universal, maybe it's better to think of it as three items with everyone having C. So, when they say a resident owns exactly two things, does that count the candy hearts? Hmm. Let me parse that again.

The problem says: "each of the 900 residents owns a bag of candy hearts." So, every resident has C. Then, they might have D, G, S, or none of those. Wait, no—actually, the problem doesn't say that; it says that each resident owns a bag of candy hearts, but the other items are the ones where some people have them. So, the total number of residents is 900, each owns at least C. So, the other items (D, G, S) are optional.

Wait, but the problem says "437 residents who own exactly two of these things", meaning two of D, G, S, or including C?

Wait, the wording is a bit ambiguous, but I think "these things" refers to the four listed: diamond ring, golf clubs, garden spade, and the bag of candy hearts. Because in the problem statement, it lists four items. So, when it says "437 residents who own exactly two of these things," it might include the candy hearts.

Wait, but that complicates things because the candy hearts are universal. So, if someone owns exactly two things, including the candy hearts, that would mean they own one other item. Because, for example, if someone owns C and D and nothing else, that's exactly two things. But wait, the problem says "exactly two of these things," which would be C plus one other, or C plus two others, but then that's more than two. Hmm, this is confusing.

Wait, perhaps "these things" refers to the three items besides the candy hearts. Let me read the problem again.

"Among the 900 residents of Aimeville, there are 195 who own a diamond ring, 367 who own a set of golf clubs, and 562 who own a garden spade. In addition, each of the 900 residents owns a bag of candy hearts. There are 437 residents who own exactly two of these things, and 234 residents who own exactly three of these things."

Hmm, the wording is "these things," which would refer to the items listed before, which are the diamond ring, golf clubs, and garden spade. So, the 437 owning exactly two would be exactly two of D, G, S, and the 234 owning exactly three of them. So, the candy hearts are separate. So, each resident has C, but they can have 0, 1, 2, 3, or all four of these things. Wait, no, because C is always there.

Wait, no, because "each of the 900 residents owns a bag of candy hearts." So, the four things are C, D, G, S. But the problem says that 195 own D, 367 own G, 562 own S, and all 900 own C. Then, the counts of exactly two and exactly three are of the four things, including C.

Wait, but that's a bit tricky because C is universal, so no one owns exactly zero of the four things—everyone owns at least C. So, the possible number of things they can own is 1, 2, 3, or 4. But the problem states that 437 own exactly two, and 234 own exactly three. So, that leaves some number owning exactly one, exactly four, or exactly three. Wait, but the problem doesn't give numbers for those, so perhaps we need to compute them.

Wait, the problem is to find the number who own all four, which would be owning D, G, S, and C. Since C is universal, it's the same as owning D, G, and S.

But let's model this properly.

Let me think in terms of variables. Let's denote:

- a = number of residents owning exactly 1 of the four things (but since everyone owns C, this would be owning C plus one other)
- b = number owning exactly two (so, exactly two of the four, which could include or exclude C)
Wait, but if someone owns exactly two of the four things, and since C is one of them, they could have C plus one other, or maybe they have two non-C items? But wait, that's impossible because if someone owns exactly two of the four things, and C is one of them, they have to have C and one more. Because if they don't have C, but that's impossible because everyone has C.

Wait, no, that's not correct. Because each resident has C, so if someone owns exactly two things, they must have C plus exactly one other. Similarly, owning exactly three would be C plus two others, and exactly four would be all three others plus C.

Wait, so that would mean:

- Exactly 1 thing: only C. But wait, but the problem says 437 own exactly two, 234 own exactly three, but it doesn't say anything about exactly one or exactly four. So, perhaps we can model this.

Wait, let's try:

Each resident owns C, and then 0, 1, 2, or 3 of the other items (D, G, S). So, the possible cases are:

- Only C: owns exactly one thing
- C and exactly one other: owns exactly two things
- C and exactly two others: owns exactly three things
- C and all three others: owns exactly four things

So, the number of residents owning exactly k of the four things is:

- Exactly 1: only C, so number is x
- Exactly 2: C and one other, so number is y
- Exactly 3: C and two others, number is z
- Exactly 4: C and all three others, number is w

The problem states that the number owning exactly two is 437, so y=437. The number owning exactly three is 234, so z=234. We need to find w, the number owning all four (which is the same as w=|D ∩ G ∩ S|, since C is universal).

The total number of residents is 900, so x + y + z + w = 900. So, x + 437 + 234 + w = 900 → x + w = 900 - 437 - 234 = 900 - 671 = 229.

So, x + w = 229. Hmm, but we don't know x or w yet.

Now, we need to relate the counts of D, G, S to these variables.

Let's think about how many people own D, G, and S.

The number of people owning D is 195. This includes:

- Those who own only D and C (so, exactly two things: C and D)
- Those who own D and one other (so, exactly three things: C, D, and one more)
- Those who own all four (C, D, G, S)

Similarly for G and S.

So, the total number of D owners is:

number owning exactly C and D (y1) + number owning C, D, and one more (z1) + number owning all four (w)

Similarly:

|D| = y1 + z1 + w
|G| = y2 + z2 + w
|S| = y3 + z3 + w

Wait, but wait, y is the total number of people owning exactly two things, which includes all possible pairs. So, y is split into those who own C and D, C and G, and C and S.

Similarly, z is the number of people owning exactly three things, which includes those owning C, D, G; C, D, S; and C, G, S.

Wait, actually, in terms of variables:

y consists of three groups:

- y1: C and D only (exactly two)
- y2: C and G only
- y3: C and S only

Similarly, z consists of three groups:

- z1: C, D, G only
- z2: C, D, S only
- z3: C, G, S only

And then w is the group that owns all four: C, D, G, S.

So, for |D|, which is the number of people owning D, it's equal to y1 + z1 + z2 + w.

Because y1 is C and D only (owns D), z1 is C, D, G (owns D), z2 is C, D, S (owns D), and w is all four (owns D).

Similarly, |G| = y2 + z1 + z3 + w
|S| = y3 + z2 + z3 + w

But this seems complicated. Maybe a better approach is to use the inclusion-exclusion principle for three sets and relate it to the given data.

Wait, perhaps I can model this problem using the inclusion-exclusion principle for three sets D, G, S. Let me denote:

The total number of people owning at least one of D, G, or S is equal to |D ∪ G ∪ S|.

But the universal set here is everyone owning C, which is 900. But the problem doesn't specify how many don't own D, G, or S—since the minimum they own is C. So, the number of people owning at least one of D, G, or S would be 900 minus the number of people who own only C. But since the problem doesn't mention how many own only C, perhaps that's the x we defined earlier.

Wait, so |D ∪ G ∪ S| = 900 - x.

Using inclusion-exclusion, |D ∪ G ∪ S| = |D| + |G| + |S| - |D∩G| - |D∩S| - |G∩S| + |D∩G∩S|.

But we don't know |D∩G|, |D∩S|, |G∩S|, or |D∩G∩S|. Hmm, perhaps we can find these in terms of y and z.

Wait, another approach: the number of people owning exactly two of D, G, S is 437. But wait, no, earlier we thought y=437 is the number owning exactly two things, which would include C and one other. So, the number owning exactly two of D, G, S, without considering C, would actually be zero, because everyone owns C. So, perhaps that part is zero.

Wait, this is getting a bit confusing. Let me try to structure it differently.

Let me think of the problem in terms of four things: C, D, G, S.

We know that each person owns C, and some combination of D, G, S.

The problem states that 437 people own exactly two things in total, which would mean they own C and exactly one other (since if you own two things and have C, the other must be one of D, G, S). Similarly, 234 people own exactly three things, which would mean they own C and two of D, G, S.

So, the number of people owning exactly two things is 437, which is the sum of those owning C and D only, C and G only, and C and S only. Let me denote:

- a = C and D only
- b = C and G only
- c = C and S only

So, a + b + c = 437.

Similarly, the number of people owning exactly three things is 234, which includes those owning C, D, and G; C, D, and S; and C, G, and S. Let me denote:

- d = C, D, G only
- e = C, D, S only
- f = C, G, S only

So, d + e + f = 234.

And the number of people owning all four is w = C, D, G, S.

Now, the total number of people is:

Only C (x) + (a + b + c) + (d + e + f) + w = x + 437 + 234 + w = 900.

So, x + w = 900 - 437 - 234 = 229.

Now, we can relate the counts of D, G, S to these variables.

The number of people owning D is equal to those owning only C and D (a) plus those owning C, D, and G (d) plus those owning C, D, and S (e) plus those owning all four (w). So,

|D| = a + d + e + w = 195.

Similarly, |G| = b + d + f + w = 367.

And |S| = c + e + f + w = 562.

So, we have three equations:

1. a + d + e + w = 195
2. b + d + f + w = 367
3. c + e + f + w = 562

We also know:

a + b + c = 437 (from exactly two)
d + e + f = 234 (from exactly three)
x + w = 229

We have five equations, but more variables. Let's see how we can solve this.

Let me sum equations 1, 2, and 3.

Sum = (a + b + c) + 3d + 3e + 3f + 3w = 195 + 367 + 562.

Wait, wait, no. Let me sum them correctly.

Equation 1: a + d + e + w = 195

Equation 2: b + d + f + w = 367

Equation 3: c + e + f + w = 562

Adding them together:

(a + b + c) + (d + d + d) + (e + e + e) + (f + f + f) + (w + w + w) = 195 + 367 + 562.

So:

(a + b + c) + 3d + 3e + 3f + 3w = 1124

But from earlier, (a + b + c) = 437, and (d + e + f) = 234.

So, substitute:

437 + 3*(d + e + f) + 3w = 1124

Because 3d + 3e + 3f = 3*(d + e + f) and 3w remains as is.

So, 437 + 3*234 + 3w = 1124

Calculate 3*234: 702

So, 437 + 702 + 3w = 1124 → 1139 + 3w = 1124

Wait, that can't be right because 1139 is greater than 1124, so 3w = 1124 - 1139 = -15 → w = -5.

Wait, that doesn't make sense because the number of people can't be negative. So, I must have made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, let's check the arithmetic again.

Sum of equations 1, 2, 3:

(a + d + e + w) + (b + d + f + w) + (c + e + f + w) = 195 + 367 + 562

Which is:

a + b + c + 3d + 3e + 3f + 3w = 1124

Because when you add the three equations:

Each of a, b, c appears once.

Each of d appears twice (from equation 1 and 2), but wait no, in equation 1, d is once, equation 2, d is once, equation 3, d is zero. So that's incorrect.

Wait, no, let me re-add:

Equation 1: a + d + e + w
Equation 2: b + d + f + w
Equation 3: c + e + f + w

Adding them:

a + d + e + w
+ b + d + f + w
+ c + e + f + w
= (a + b + c) + (d + d) + (e + e) + (f + f) + (w + w + w)
= (a + b + c) + 2d + 2e + 2f + 3w

So, sum is:

(a + b + c) + 2d + 2e + 2f + 3w = 195 + 367 + 562.

So, 195 + 367 is 562, plus 562 is 1124.

Now, a + b + c = 437, and d + e + f = 234.

So, let me substitute:

437 + 2d + 2e + 2f + 3w = 1124

Factor out the 2 from d, e, f terms:

437 + 2*(d + e + f) + 3w = 1124

Which is:

437 + 2*234 + 3w = 1124

Calculate 2*234: 468

So, 437 + 468 = 905

Then, 905 + 3w = 1124 → 3w = 1124 - 905 = 219 → w = 73.

Okay, that makes sense. So, the number of people owning all four, w, is 73.

Wait, let me check if this fits into the earlier equation where x + w = 229.

So, w=73 → x = 229 - 73 = 156.

So, 156 people own only C.

Now, let me check if all the equations fit.

We have:

1. a + d + e + w = 195

2. b + d + f + w = 367

3. c + e + f + w = 562

We know that a + b + c = 437, and d + e + f = 234, and w=73.

So, let's compute each of the three equations.

Equation 1: a + d + e + 73 = 195 → a + d + e = 122.

Equation 2: b + d + f +73=367 → b + d + f = 294.

Equation 3: c + e + f +73=562 → c + e + f = 489.

Now, let's see:

We have a + b + c =437.

And d + e + f =234.

So, let's try to express a, b, c in terms of these.

From Equation 1: a = 122 - d - e.

From Equation 2: b = 294 - d - f.

From Equation 3: c = 489 - e - f.

Now, a + b + c = (122 - d - e) + (294 - d - f) + (489 - e - f) = 122 + 294 + 489 - 2d - 2e - 2f.

Which should be equal to 437.

So, 122 + 294 is 416, plus 489 is 905.

So, 905 - 2*(d + e + f) = 437.

But d + e + f =234, so 2*(d + e + f)=468.

So, 905 - 468 = 437, which matches. So that's correct.

Now, let's see if we can find individual variables. But maybe we don't need to.

We were only asked for w, which is 73. So, the number of people who own all four is 73.

Let me just make sure this makes sense.

So, the number of people owning all four is 73. The number owning exactly three is 234, which includes those owning C, D, G; C, D, S; and C, G, S.

Wait, and when we sum all of these, with the overlaps, the numbers add up correctly.

Yes, this seems consistent.


To solve the problem, we use set theory and the principle of inclusion-exclusion. We denote:

- \( |D| = 195 \) (diamond ring owners),
- \( |G| = 367 \) (golf clubs owners),
- \( |S| = 562 \) (garden spade owners),
- \( |C| = 900 \) (candy hearts owners, universal set).

We are given:
- 437 residents own exactly two of the four items,
- 234 residents own exactly three of the four items.

Let:
- \( w \) = number of residents owning all four items,
- \( y = 437 \) = number of residents owning exactly two items,
- \( z = 234 \) = number of residents owning exactly three items.

The total number of residents is 900, so:
\[
x + y + z + w = 900 \implies x + w = 900 - 437 - 234 = 229.
\]

Using the inclusion-exclusion principle for sets \( D, G, S \):
\[
|D \cup G \cup S| = |D| + |G| + |S| - |D \cap G| - |D \cap S| - |G \cap S| + |D \cap G \cap S|.
\]
However, since \( C \) is universal, we adjust the counts to include \( C \) in all intersections. Summing the individual ownership equations:
\[
a + d + e + w = 195, \quad b + d + f + w = 367, \quad c + e + f + w = 562,
\]
where \( a, b, c \) are residents owning exactly two items (with \( C \)), and \( d, e, f \) are those owning exactly three items (with \( C \)).

Summing these equations:
\[
(a + b + c) + 2(d + e + f) + 3w = 195 + 367 + 562 = 1124.
\]
Substituting \( a + b + c = 437 \) and \( d + e + f = 234 \):
\[
437 + 2(234) + 3w = 1124 \implies 905 + 3w = 1124 \implies 3w = 219 \implies w = 73.
\]

Thus, the number of residents owning all four items is \(\boxed{73}\).
