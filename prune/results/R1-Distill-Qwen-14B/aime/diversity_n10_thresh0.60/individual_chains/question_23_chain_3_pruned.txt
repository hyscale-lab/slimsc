Okay, so I've got this problem here with a hyperbola and a rhombus. Let me try to break it down step by step.

First, the hyperbola is given by the equation x²/20 - y²/24 = 1. So, it's a standard hyperbola centered at the origin, opening to the left and right along the x-axis. The transverse axis is along the x-axis because the positive term is under x².

Now, the points A, B, C, D lie on this hyperbola, and ABCD is a rhombus. The diagonals of the rhombus intersect at the origin. So, the origin is the midpoint of both diagonals. That makes sense because in a rhombus, the diagonals bisect each other.

Since it's a rhombus, all sides are equal in length, and the diagonals are perpendicular bisectors of each other. Also, the diagonals intersect at the origin, so the origin is the midpoint.

Let me think about how to model the points A, B, C, D. Since the diagonals intersect at the origin, each pair of opposite points are symmetric with respect to the origin. So, if A is at (x, y), then C would be at (-x, -y). Similarly, if B is at (p, q), then D would be at (-p, -q).

So, the four points are A(x, y), B(p, q), C(-x, -y), and D(-p, -q). Since ABCD is a rhombus, the sides AB, BC, CD, DA are all equal in length.

Wait, but in a rhombus, the diagonals are not necessarily equal, but they are perpendicular. So, the vectors along the diagonals should be perpendicular.

Alternatively, since the diagonals intersect at the origin, the vectors OA and OC are endpoints of one diagonal, and OB and OD are endpoints of the other diagonal.

So, the diagonals are AC and BD. Since the diagonals are perpendicular, the vectors AC and BD should be perpendicular. So, the vector AC is from A to C, which is (-2x, -2y), and the vector BD is from B to D, which is (-2p, -2q). Wait, but the vectors AC and BD are just twice the vectors from the origin to A and B, respectively. So, the vectors OA and OB might be perpendicular.

Wait, if OA and OB are perpendicular, then the vectors (x, y) and (p, q) are perpendicular. So, their dot product is zero: x*p + y*q = 0.

So, that gives a condition on points A and B.

Moreover, since all four points lie on the hyperbola, each point must satisfy x²/20 - y²/24 = 1, and similarly for p and q.

Now, to find BD², which is the square of the length of diagonal BD. Since BD connects points B(p, q) and D(-p, -q), the length BD is the distance between these two points. So, BD = sqrt[(p - (-p))² + (q - (-q))²] = sqrt[(2p)² + (2q)²] = 2*sqrt(p² + q²). Therefore, BD² = (
