Okay, so I've got this math problem here about Aya's morning walk. Let me try to parse it step by step. 

First, the problem says that every morning, Aya goes for a 9-kilometer-long walk and stops at a coffee shop afterwards. When she walks at a constant speed of s kilometers per hour, the walk takes her 4 hours, including t minutes spent in the coffee shop. Then, when she walks at s+2 km/h, the walk takes her 2 hours and 24 minutes, again including t minutes in the coffee shop. Now, they're asking what the time taken would be if she walks at s + 1/2 km/h, including the t minutes in the coffee shop. We need to find the number of minutes this would take.

Hmm, okay. So, let's break it down. The walk is 9 kilometers. At different speeds, the time taken changes, but the coffee shop time, t, stays the same each time. So, the total time includes both walking time and t minutes of coffee break.

Wait, so when she walks at speed s, the total time is 4 hours. But the 4 hours includes both the time she spends walking and the time she spends at the coffee shop. Similarly, when she walks at s+2, the total time is 2 hours and 24 minutes, which again includes both walking and coffee time.

So, maybe I can set up two equations based on this information, then solve for s and t. Once I have s, I can compute the time taken at s + 1/2 km/h.

Let me denote:

- Distance: D = 9 km
- Speed: s (km/h)
- Time walking: let's call it T1 (hours)
- Total time including coffee: 4 hours
- So, T1 + t (in hours) = 4 hours.

Wait, but t is in minutes. Hmm. So, I need to be careful with units. Let me convert all times to hours or all to minutes. Maybe hours would be better since speed is in km per hour.

So, let's convert t into hours. Since t is in minutes, t minutes is t/60 hours.

So, for the first scenario:

Walking speed: s km/h
Time walking: D/s = 9/s hours
Total time including coffee: 4 hours = (9/s) + (t/60)

Similarly, for the second scenario:

Walking speed: (s + 2) km/h
Time walking: 9/(s+2) hours
Total time including coffee: 2 hours and 24 minutes. Let's convert that into hours: 24 minutes is 24/60 = 0.4 hours, so total is 2.4 hours. Thus, 2.4 = (9/(s+2)) + (t/60)

So, now I have two equations:

1) 9/s + t/60 = 4
2) 9/(s+2) + t/60 = 2.4

Hmm. I can subtract equation 2 from equation 1 to eliminate t.

So, subtracting equation 2 from equation 1:

[9/s + t/60] - [9/(s+2) + t/60] = 4 - 2.4
Simplify left side: 9/s - 9/(s+2) + t/60 - t/60 = 1.6
So, 9/s - 9/(s+2) = 1.6

Let me compute 9/s - 9/(s+2). Let me factor it:

9 [1/s - 1/(s+2)] = 1.6

Compute 1/s - 1/(s+2) = [ (s+2) - s ] / [s(s+2) ] = 2/(s(s+2))

So, 9 * [2/(s(s+2))] = 1.6

So, 18/(s(s+2)) = 1.6

Let me write that as:

18 = 1.6 * s (s + 2)

Compute 1.6 * s(s+2) = 1.6s² + 3.2s

So, 18 = 1.6s² + 3.2s

Let me write that equation:

1.6s² + 3.2s - 18 = 0

Hmm, dealing with decimals can be a bit messy. Maybe I can multiply both sides by 10 to eliminate the decimals.

10*(1.6s² + 3.2s - 18) = 0
16s² + 32s - 180 = 0

Simplify. Let's see if we can divide by a common factor. 16, 32, 180: they are all divisible by 4?

16 /4 =4, 32/4=8, 180/4=45.

So, 4s² +8s -45=0.

Now, that's a quadratic equation: 4s² +8s -45=0

Let me solve this quadratic equation for s. Using the quadratic formula:

s = [ -b ± sqrt(b² -4ac) ] / (2a)

Here, a=4, b=8, c=-45.

Discriminant: b² -4ac = 64 -4*4*(-45) = 64 + 720 = 784

Square root of 784 is 28.

So, s = [ -8 ± 28 ] / (8)

We can ignore the negative solution because speed can't be negative.

So, s = ( -8 + 28 ) / 8 = 20/8 = 2.5 km/h

Wait, 20 divided by 8 is 2.5? Let me check: 8 * 2 =16, 8 * 2.5= 20. Yep, correct.

So, s = 2.5 km/h.

Now, let's find t. Let's plug back into one of the original equations. Let's use equation 1:

9/s + t/60 = 4

s is 2.5, so 9/2.5 = 3.6 hours.

So, 3.6 + t/60 =4

So, t/60 = 0.4 hours.

Convert 0.4 hours into minutes: 0.4 *60 =24 minutes.

So, t=24 minutes.

Let me verify with equation 2 to make sure.

Equation 2: 9/(s+2) + t/60 = 2.4

s+2 = 4.5 km/h.

9/4.5 = 2 hours.

t/60=24/60=0.4 hours.

So, 2 + 0.4=2.4, which matches. Perfect.

So, now, the question is, suppose Aya walks at s + 1/2 km/h. What is the time taken, including t minutes.

First, compute s + 1/2. s is 2.5, so 2.5 + 0.5=3 km/h.

So, her walking speed is 3 km/h.

Time taken to walk 9 km at 3 km/h is 9/3=3 hours.

Plus t minutes, which is 24 minutes.

So, total time is 3 hours and 24 minutes.

But the question says to find the number of minutes, including t minutes.

So, 3 hours is 180 minutes, plus 24 minutes is 204 minutes.

Wait, let me double-check the calculation.

Walking time: 9 km at 3 km/h is 3 hours
