Okay, so I'm trying to solve this math problem where I need to find the greatest four-digit number N with a specific property. The property is that if you change any one of its digits to 1, the resulting number is divisible by 7. Then, once I find N, I need to find Q and R where Q is the quotient and R is the remainder when N is divided by 1000. Finally, I have to compute Q + R.

Hmm, let's break this down. First, I need to understand the problem. N is a four-digit number, so it's between 1000 and 9999. The key part is that changing any single digit to 1 makes the number divisible by 7. That means, for example, if the thousands digit is changed to 1, the new number is divisible by 7. Similarly, if the hundreds, tens, or units digit is changed to 1, each of those should also result in a number divisible by 7.

So, N is such that replacing any digit with 1 gives a multiple of 7. I need to find the largest such N, then compute Q + R where N = Q*1000 + R.

Let me think about how to approach this.

First, let's denote N as a four-digit number: N = ABCD, where A, B, C, D are its digits, with A being the thousands digit, B the hundreds, C the tens, and D the units digit. So, A can be from 1 to 9, and B, C, D can be from 0 to 9.

The problem states that if we change any one digit to 1, the resulting number is divisible by 7. So, changing A to 1, B to 1, C to 1, or D to 1 each should result in a number divisible by 7.

So, for each digit position, replacing it with 1 gives a multiple of 7. That gives me four conditions:

1. Replacing A with 1: 1BCD is divisible by 7.
2. Replacing B with 1: A1CD is divisible by 7.
3. Replacing C with 1: AB1D is divisible by 7.
4. Replacing D with 1: ABC1 is divisible by 7.

Additionally, N itself doesn't necessarily have to be divisible by 7, right? Because the problem only specifies that changing a digit to 1 makes it divisible by 7. So, N could be anything, but these four modified numbers must be divisible by 7.

So, N is ABCD, and each of the four numbers 1BCD, A1CD, AB1D, ABC1 must be divisible by 7.

My goal is to find the largest possible ABCD (so starting from 9999 and working downwards) that satisfies all four conditions.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to model these conditions mathematically.

Let me write expressions for each modified number:

1. 1BCD = 1000*1 + 100*B + 10*C + D
2. A1CD = 1000*A + 100*1 + 10*C + D
3. AB1D = 1000*A + 100*B + 10*1 + D
4. ABC1 = 1000*A + 100*B + 10*C + 1

Each of these must be divisible by 7. So, each of these expressions modulo 7 must be zero.

Let me compute each expression modulo 7.

First, let's find what 1000, 100, 10, and 1 are modulo 7.

Calculating:

7 * 142 = 994, so 1000 - 994 = 6. So, 1000 ≡ 6 mod7.

Similarly, 100 /7: 7*14 = 98, so 100 -98=2, so 100 ≡2 mod7.

10/7=1*7=7, so 10≡3 mod7.

1≡1 mod7.

So:

1. 1BCD mod7 = (1*6 + B*2 + C*3 + D*1) mod7 = (6 + 2B + 3C + D) mod7 = 0.
2. A1CD mod7 = (A*6 + 1*2 + C*3 + D*1) mod7 = (6A + 2 + 3C + D) mod7 = 0.
3. AB1D mod7 = (A*6 + B*2 + 1*3 + D*1) mod7 = (6A + 2B + 3 + D) mod7 = 0.
4. ABC1 mod7 = (A*6 + B*2 + C*3 + 1*1) mod7 = (6A + 2B + 3C +1) mod7 = 0.

So, each of these four expressions equals zero mod7.

So, we have four equations:

1. 6 + 2B + 3C + D ≡ 0 mod7.  (Equation 1)
2. 6A + 2 + 3C + D ≡ 0 mod7. (Equation 2)
3. 6A + 2B + 3 + D ≡ 0 mod7. (Equation 3)
4. 6A + 2B + 3C + 1 ≡ 0 mod7. (Equation 4)

So, we have four equations with variables A, B, C, D (digits from 0-9, except A≥1).

We need to solve these equations to find A, B, C, D.

Since all four equations are mod7, perhaps we can manipulate them to find relationships between A, B, C, D.

Let me try to subtract equations to eliminate variables.

For example, subtract Equation 1 from Equation 2:

Equation2 - Equation1:

(6A + 2 + 3C + D) - (6 + 2B + 3C + D) = 6A + 2 -6 -2B = 6A -2B -4.

This difference must be ≡0 mod7.

So, 6A -2B -4 ≡0 mod7.

We can write this as:

6A -2B ≡4 mod7.

Similarly, let me see if I can get other relationships.

Another idea: perhaps I can express D from Equation 1 and substitute into others.

From Equation1:

6 + 2B + 3C + D ≡0 mod7.

So, D ≡ (-6 -2B -3C) mod7.

Similarly, from Equation2:

6A + 2 + 3C + D ≡0 mod7.

Substituting D from Equation1:

6A + 2 + 3C + (-6 -2B -3C) ≡0 mod7.

Simplify:

6A +2 -6 -2B +3C -3C ≡0 mod7.

So, 6A -2B -4 ≡0 mod7.

Which is the same as before. So that gives 6A -2B ≡4 mod7.

Similarly, Equation3:

6A + 2B + 3 + D ≡0 mod7.

Again, substitute D from Equation1.

So,

6A + 2B +3 + (-6 -2B -3C) ≡0 mod7.

Simplify:

6A + 2B +3 -6 -2B -3C ≡0 mod7.

Simplify:

6A -3 -3C ≡0 mod7.

So, 6A -3C ≡3 mod7.

Divide both sides by 3 (since 3 and 7 are coprime, this is allowed).

So, 2A - C ≡1 mod7. Because 6/3=2, 3/3=1, 3/3=1.

Wait, 6A -3C =3 mod7.

Dividing both sides by 3:

2A - C ≡1 mod7. (Equation5)

Similarly, let's take Equation4:

6A +2B +3C
