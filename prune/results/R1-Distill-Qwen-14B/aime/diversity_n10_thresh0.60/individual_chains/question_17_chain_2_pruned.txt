Okay, so I need to solve this problem where I have a set of rectangular boxes with a surface area of 54 and a volume of 23. I'm supposed to find the radius of the smallest sphere that can contain each of these boxes, and then find r squared expressed as a fraction p/q where p and q are coprime. Finally, I need to compute p + q.

Hmm, let's start by recalling that for a rectangular box with side lengths x, y, z, the surface area is 2(xy + yz + xz) and the volume is xyz. So in this case, the surface area is 54, which gives the equation:

2(xy + yz + xz) = 54  
=> xy + yz + xz = 27.

And the volume is 23, so:

xyz = 23.

I need to find the minimal sphere that can contain such a box. The sphere's radius will be half the space diagonal of the box. The space diagonal d of a box with sides x, y, z is given by sqrt(x² + y² + z²). So the radius r is d/2, so r² = (x² + y² + z²)/4.

So my goal is to minimize r², which is equivalent to minimizing x² + y² + z², given the constraints on surface area and volume.

So, I need to minimize x² + y² + z², subject to:

1. xy + yz + xz = 27  
2. xyz = 23.

I think I can use the method of Lagrange multipliers here, but I might need to set up the constraints properly.

Alternatively, perhaps I can express two variables in terms of the third and then find the minimum.

Wait, maybe it's better to express everything in terms of symmetric functions. Let me denote S = x + y + z, P = xy + yz + xz = 27, and Q = xyz = 23.

I also know that x² + y² + z² = S² - 2P. Since P is 27, x² + y² + z² = S² - 54.

So, I need to minimize S² - 54, which is equivalent to minimizing S².

So, the problem reduces to finding the minimal possible S² given that the product xyz = 23 and xy + yz + xz = 27.

Hmm, perhaps I can use the AM ≥ GM inequality, but I'm not sure if that's directly applicable here because we have different constraints.

Wait, another approach: the minimal S occurs when the variables are as close as possible. Maybe the minimal x² + y² + z² occurs when the box is as close to a cube as possible. But I'm not certain if that's the case here because the volume is fixed, but perhaps the surface area also being fixed complicates things.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use the method of Lagrange multipliers. Let's try that.

Let me define the function to minimize: f(x, y, z) = x² + y² + z².

Subject to the constraints:

g(x
