Okay, so I have this problem here where I need to find the number of intersections between two graphs. The equations are given as:

\[ y = 4 g(f(\sin (2 \pi x))) \quad \text{and} \quad x = 4 g(f(\cos (3 \pi y))). \]

And the functions f and g are defined as:

\[ f(x) = ||x| - \frac{1}{2}| \]
\[ g(x) = ||x| - \frac{1}{4}| \]

Hmm, alright. Let me try to break this down. It's about finding the number of points where these two graphs intersect. So essentially, I'm looking for all pairs (x, y) such that both equations are satisfied. That means substituting y from the first equation into the second equation, but wait, the second equation is x in terms of y, so it's a bit more involved.

First, let me understand what these functions f and g look like.

Starting with f(x) = ||x| - 1/2|. So f is a double absolute value function. Let me think about the graph of f(x).

The inner function is |x|, which is a V-shape with the vertex at (0,0). Then subtract 1/2, so |x| - 1/2 is a V shifted down by 1/2. But then we take the absolute value of that, so f(x) = ||x| - 1/2|.

So, f(x) will have a W-shape, right? Because the absolute value of a V-shape shifted down. Let me see:

- When |x| - 1/2 is negative, which happens when |x| < 1/2, then f(x) becomes -( |x| - 1/2 ) = 1/2 - |x|.
- When |x| >= 1/2, f(x) is |x| - 1/2.

So, the graph of f(x) is a V-shaped graph that touches the x-axis at x = ±1/2, and then goes upwards on either side. Wait, actually, no. Wait, when |x| is less than 1/2, f(x) is 1/2 - |x|, which is a V upside down, peaking at (0, 1/2), and then when |x| is beyond 1/2, it becomes |x| - 1/2, which is a V going upwards. So, the graph of f(x) is a W-shape, with the central peak at (0, 1/2) and then two Vs on either side starting at x = ±1/2.

Similarly, g(x) is ||x| - 1/4|. Let's think about that.

The inner function is |x|, subtract 1/4, then take absolute value. So:

- When |x| < 1/4, g(x) = (1/4 - |x|).
- When |x| >= 1/4, g(x) = |x| - 1/4.

So, the graph of g(x) is also a W-shape but with a different scale. It peaks at (0, 1/4) and then has Vs starting at x = ±1/4.

So, both f and g are piecewise linear functions with multiple segments.

Now, the functions in the problem involve f and g composed with sine and cosine functions, then scaled by 4.

Let me write out the functions again:

First function: y = 4 g(f(sin(2πx)))

Second function: x = 4 g(f(cos(3πy)))

So, both involve 4 times g(f of some trigonometric function). Let's try to analyze each step by step.

Let me first try to understand what f(sin(2πx)) looks like.

So, sin(2πx) is a sine wave with period 1, because the period of sin(2πx) is 2π/(2π) = 1. So, it's a sine wave that goes from -1 to 1, oscillating every 1 unit along the x-axis.

Then, f is applied to this sine wave. Since f is a piecewise linear function, applying it to sin(2πx) will create a transformation of the sine wave.

Let me think about the range of sin(2πx). It's between -1 and 1. So f(sin(2πx)) will take values as f is defined for all real numbers, but since sin(2πx) is between -1 and 1, I can compute f over that interval.

From earlier, f(x) for x in [-1,1]:

- For |x| <= 1/2, f(x) = 1/2 - |x|
- For |x| >= 1/2, f(x) = |x| - 1/2

So, when x is in [-1,1], f(x) will be:

- When x between -1/2 and 1/2, f(x) is 1/2 - |x|
- When x is between -1 and -1/2, or 1/2 and 1, f(x) is |x| - 1/2

So, f(sin(2πx)) will take the sine wave and transform it. Let me sketch what that might look like.

Since sin(2πx) is symmetric around 0, f(sin(2πx)) will also be symmetric. The maximum of sin(2πx) is 1, so f(1) = |1| -1/2 = 1/2. Similarly, f(-1) = |-1| -1/2 = 1/2. At x = 0, sin(0) = 0, so f(0) = 1/2.

Wait, so f(sin(2πx)) reaches a maximum of 1/2 at points where sin(2πx) is 0, ±1.

Wait, let me compute some specific points:

At x = 0: sin(0)=0 → f(0)=1/2.

At x=1/4: sin(2π*(1/4))=sin(π/2)=1
