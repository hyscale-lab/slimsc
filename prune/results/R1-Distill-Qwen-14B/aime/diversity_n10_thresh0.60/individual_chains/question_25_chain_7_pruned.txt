Okay, so I've got this problem about residents in Aimeville and the things they own. Let me try to parse it step by step. 

First, the total number of residents is 900. Each of them owns a bag of candy hearts. So, candy hearts are universal—everyone has them. Then, there are three other items: diamond rings, golf clubs, and garden spades. The numbers given are 195 owning a diamond ring, 367 owning golf clubs, and 562 owning a garden spade. 

Now, interestingly, 437 residents own exactly two of these things, and 234 own exactly three. The question is asking how many own all four—so, diamond ring, golf clubs, garden spade, and candy hearts. But wait, since everyone has candy hearts, owning all four is the same as owning the other three. Hmm, that might be useful.

Let me recall some set theory principles. I think the inclusion-exclusion principle is relevant here. The formula for four sets might be complicated, but since everyone has candy hearts, maybe it's easier to think about the other three. Because if someone owns all four, they definitely own the other three. So perhaps we can model this with three sets and then adjust for the fourth.

Wait, let me get the problem's data straight:

- Total residents: 900
- Own candy hearts: 900 (all)
- Own diamond ring: 195
- Own golf clubs: 367
- Own garden spade: 562
- Exactly two of these things: 437
- Exactly three of these things: 234
- Find: exactly four, which is the same as exactly three of the other items since candy hearts are universal.

Wait, actually, since candy hearts are already included in everyone's ownership, if someone owns all four, they must have all three of the other items. So the number of people owning all four is equal to the number of people owning all three of the other items. So, essentially, the 234 who own exactly three of the four items must include those who own all three of diamond, golf, and spade, and candy hearts. So, maybe the 234 is the number of people who own exactly three of the four, which includes the fact that candy hearts are one of them
