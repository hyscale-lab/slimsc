Okay, so I've got this geometry problem to solve. Let me read it again and try to understand what's being asked.

We have three points: O at (0,0), A at (1/2, 0), and B at (0, sqrt(3)/2). So, O is the origin, A is somewhere on the x-axis halfway between 0 and 1, and B is on the y-axis. I can imagine this forming a triangle OAB, but I'm not sure yet.

The family F consists of segments PQ of unit length. Each segment PQ lies in the first quadrant, with P on the x-axis and Q on the y-axis. So, these are line segments from the x-axis to the y-axis, each exactly 1 unit long. That makes sense. So, for any such segment PQ, P is (p, 0) and Q is (0, q), and the distance between P and Q is 1. So, the distance formula tells me that sqrt((p)^2 + (q)^2) = 1, which means p^2 + q^2 = 1. So, all such P and Q lie on the unit circle, but since they're in the first quadrant, p and q are positive.

So, any segment PQ in F is a chord of the unit circle in the first quadrant, connecting (p,0) to (0,q) where p^2 + q^2 = 1.

Now, the problem says there's a unique point C on AB, distinct from A and B, that doesn't belong to any segment from F other than AB itself. So, AB is one of these segments in F. Because A is (1/2, 0) and B is (0, sqrt(3)/2), let's check if AB is length 1.

Calculating AB's length: sqrt[(1/2 - 0)^2 + (0 - sqrt(3)/2)^2] = sqrt[(1/4) + (3/4)] = sqrt[1] = 1. So, AB is indeed a segment in F.

So, the point C is on AB, not at A or B, and it's the only point on AB that doesn't lie on any other segment from F. So, for all other segments PQ in F, C isn't on them. So, we need to find this point C and then compute OC^2, which is the square of the distance from the origin to point C. Then, express that as a fraction p/q where p and q are coprime, and find p + q.

Alright, step by step.

First, let's parameterize the line AB. Since it goes from A(1/2, 0) to B(0, sqrt(3)/2), we can write its parametric equations.

Let me find the equation of the line AB. The slope m is (y2 - y1)/(x2 - x1) = (sqrt(3)/2 - 0)/(0 - 1/2) = (sqrt(3)/2) / (-1/2) = -sqrt(3). So, the slope is -sqrt(3).

Using point-slope form, starting from point A(1/2, 0):

y - 0 = -sqrt(3)(x - 1/2)
y = -sqrt(3)x + (sqrt(3)/2)

So, the equation of AB is y = -sqrt(3)x + sqrt(3)/2.

Now, any point C on AB can be written as (x, -sqrt(3)x + sqrt(3)/2), where x is between 0 and 1/2.

We need to find C such that it doesn't lie on any other segment PQ in F, except for AB itself.

So, for all other segments PQ in F (with P on x-axis, Q on y-axis, PQ=1), point C is not on PQ unless PQ is AB.

So, to find C, we can think that for any other PQ segment (other than AB), point C is not on PQ.

But how do we find such a point? It's the unique point on AB that is not intersected by any other segment from F.

Wait, that suggests that C is the point where, if any other PQ from F were to pass through C, it would have to coincide with AB. So, maybe C is the point where all the other PQ segments just 'miss' C except for AB.

Alternatively, perhaps C is the point where the envelope of all such segments PQ touches AB.

Hmmm, envelope of a family of curves. That could be a way to approach it. The envelope is a curve that is tangent to each member of the family at some point. So, if we can find the envelope of the family F, then the point C is where this envelope touches AB.

Alternatively, perhaps C is the point where AB is tangent to the envelope of F.

Let me think about the envelope. So, the family F consists of all segments PQ with P(p, 0) and Q(0, q), where p^2 + q^2 = 1.

Each segment PQ can be represented as the line connecting (p, 0) to (0, q). The equation of this line is x/p + y/q = 1. But since p^2 + q^2 = 1, we can write q = sqrt(1 - p^2), but that might complicate things.

So, the equation is x/p + y/(sqrt(1 -
