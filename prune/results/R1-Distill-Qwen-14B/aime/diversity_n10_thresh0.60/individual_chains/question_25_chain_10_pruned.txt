Okay, I've got this math problem here about the residents of Aimeville. Let me read it again and try to understand what's being asked. So, there are 900 residents total. Each resident owns a bag of candy hearts, which is interesting because that means the number of candy heart owners is 900. Then, there are three other things: diamond rings, golf clubs, and garden spades. The numbers given are 195 for diamond rings, 367 for golf clubs, and 562 for garden spades. 

Also, it says that 437 residents own exactly two of these things, and 234 own exactly three. The question is asking for the number of residents who own all four things, which would be the candy hearts plus the other three. So, we're looking for the number of people who have all four items.

Hmm, okay, so this sounds like a problem that involves sets and maybe using the principle of inclusion-exclusion. I remember that inclusion-exclusion helps in calculating the union of multiple sets by adding up the sizes of the individual sets, subtracting the intersections, adding back in the intersections of three sets, and so on. But since the problem mentions exactly two and exactly three, I might need to adjust for those as well.

Let me try to outline what I know. The total number of residents is 900, and everyone owns candy hearts. So, the universal set here is 900. The other three items are subsets of this universal set.

Let me denote:
- D as the set of residents who own a diamond ring.
- G as those who own golf clubs.
- S as those who own a garden spade.
- C as candy hearts, which is everyone, so |C| = 900.

We are told:
- |D| = 195
- |G| = 367
- |S| = 562
- Number of residents owning exactly two of these things (D, G, S) is 437.
- Number owning exactly three of these things is 234.
- We need to find the number who own all four, which would be |D ∩ G ∩ S ∩ C|. But since C is everyone, it's just |D ∩ G ∩ S|.

Wait, actually, if someone owns all four, since they already own C, which is given to everyone, it's the same as owning all three of D, G, S. So, the number of people who own all four is equal to the number of people who own D, G, and S. So, our target is |D ∩ G ∩ S|.

But how do we find that using the given information?

I think the inclusion-exclusion principle for three sets might help here. The formula for the union of three sets is:

|D ∪ G ∪ S| = |D| + |G| + |S| - |D ∩ G| - |D ∩ S| - |G ∩ S| + |D ∩ G ∩ S|

But we also know the total number of residents is 900, and since everyone owns C (candy hearts), the union of D, G, S must be 900 because all residents own at least C. Wait, actually, no. Because the union of D, G, S would be the number of people who own at least one of D, G, or S. But since everyone owns C, which is separate, the total number of residents is 900. Hmm, maybe I'm confusing something here.

Wait, actually, C is an item that everyone owns. So, the problem is about four items, but C is universal. So, when considering the other three items, D, G, S, their union might not necessarily cover all residents because some might not own D, G, or S. But wait, the total is 900, and each person owns C, so the total number of people is 900 regardless. So, perhaps the union of D, G, S is the number of people who own at least one of D, G, or S, and the rest (900 minus that number) own only C.

But the problem doesn't specify how many people own none of D, G, or S, but I might be able to figure it out.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to consider the problem as four sets, but since C is universal, maybe we can model it differently. Alternatively, think about the problem in terms of the principle of inclusion-exclusion for four sets, but that's more complicated.

Wait, maybe I can approach it using the counts of exactly two and exactly three. Let me recall that in inclusion-exclusion, the counts of exactly two and exactly three can be used to find the overlaps.

Let me define:
- a = number of people who own exactly one of D, G, S.
- b = number owning exactly two of them, which is given as 437.
-
