Okay, so I've got this problem to solve. It says: Find the largest possible real part of \[(75 + 117i)z + \frac{96 + 144i}{z}\] where \( z \) is a complex number with \( |z| = 4 \). Hmm, that's interesting. Let me try to break this down step by step.

First, I remember that for any complex number \( z \) with a fixed modulus, say \( |z| = r \), we can represent \( z \) in polar form. That might make things easier, especially since we're dealing with operations like multiplication and division by \( z \).

So, let me write \( z \) as \( z = 4e^{i\theta} \), where \( \theta \) is the argument of \( z \). Since \( |z| = 4 \), this polar form should capture all possible \( z \) we're dealing with.

Now, the expression given is \( (75 + 117i)z + \frac{96 + 144i}{z} \). Let me substitute \( z = 4e^{i\theta} \) into this expression.

First, compute \( (75 + 117i)z \):
\( (75 + 117i) \times 4e^{i\theta} = 4(75 + 117i)e^{i\theta} \).

Next, compute \( \frac{96 + 144i}{z} \):
Since \( z = 4e^{i\theta} \), the reciprocal \( 1/z = \frac{1}{4}e^{-i\theta} \). So, \( \frac{96 + 144i}{z} = (96 + 144i) \times \frac{1}{4}e^{-i\theta} = 24(1 + 1.5i)e^{-i\theta} \). Wait, 96/4 is 24 and 144/4 is 36. Oh, wait, 144/4 is 36, so it's 24(4 + 6i)/4? Wait, no, 96/4 is 24, and 144/4 is 36. So it's 24 + 36i. So actually, it's \( (24 + 36i)e^{-i\theta} \).

So putting it all together, the expression becomes:
\[ 4(75 + 117i)e^{i\theta} + (24 + 36i)e^{-i\theta} \].

Hmm. Let me write this in terms of exponentials. Maybe I can combine these terms. Alternatively, perhaps I can express each term in terms of sine and cosine to separate the real and imaginary parts.

Wait, another thought: perhaps instead of directly substituting \( z = 4e^{i
