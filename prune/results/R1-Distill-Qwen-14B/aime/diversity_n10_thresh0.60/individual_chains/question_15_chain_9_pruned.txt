Okay, so I've got this problem about counting the number of paths on an 8x8 grid. The paths start at the lower left corner and end at the upper right corner, and they have a length of 16. I need to find how many such paths change direction exactly four times. Hmm, let me try to break this down.

First, I should visualize the grid. An 8x8 grid has 9 horizontal and 9 vertical lines, right? So, moving from the lower left to the upper right, you have to move 8 steps to the right and 8 steps up, in some order. The total number of paths without any restrictions is the combination of 16 steps taken 8 at a time for right (or up), which is C(16,8). But here, we have a restriction on the number of direction changes.

Wait, direction changes. So, each time the path switches from moving right to up or from up to right, that's a direction change. So, if a path changes direction exactly four times, how does that break down?

Let me think. Each direction change alternates between right and up. So, starting with right, then up, then right, etc. But it could also start with up and then alternate. Hmm, but since the grid is square, maybe the starting direction doesn't matter, but I should consider both cases.

Wait, no. Because the path starts at the lower left corner. To get to the upper right corner, the first move has to be either right or up. But in an 8x8 grid, you need exactly 8 rights and 8 ups, so the path has to start with either right or up, but the number of rights and ups must each be 8.

But if the path changes direction four times, how many segments does that make? Each direction change marks the end of a segment. So, if you change direction four times, you have five segments. Wait, is that right? Because the first segment has no previous direction, then each change adds a new segment. So, four changes lead to five segments.

Each segment is a straight line either to the right or upwards. And each segment must consist of at least one step. Because you can't have a segment of zero length; that would mean not changing direction at all, which isn't allowed.

So, the path is composed of five segments, alternating between right and up. Let me think about how many right and up segments there are
