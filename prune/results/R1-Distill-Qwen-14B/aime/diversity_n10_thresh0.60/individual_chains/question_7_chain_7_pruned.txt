Okay, so I've got this probability problem about a regular octagon. Each vertex is colored either red or blue with equal chance, right? And the question is asking for the probability that we can rotate the octagon such that all the blue vertices end up where red ones were originally. The answer needs to be in the form m/n where m and n are coprime, and then find m + n.

Hmm, let me try to unpack this. So, we're dealing with a regular octagon, which has 8 vertices. Each vertex is colored red or blue, each with a probability of 1/2, and the colorings are independent. So, the total number of possible colorings is 2^8 = 256. That's the denominator of our probability.

Now, the numerator is the number of colorings where there exists a rotation such that every blue vertex moves to a position that was originally red. Wait, so if we rotate the octagon, all the blue vertices must end up where there were reds before the rotation. So, the rotation must map the set of blue vertices to the set of red vertices.

Let me think about what that implies. So, if after rotation, all blue vertices are on red positions, that means the set of blue vertices is a rotation of the set of red vertices. But since every vertex is either red or blue, the set of blue vertices is just the complement of the set of red vertices. So, the rotation must map the blue set to the red set. Which is the same as saying that the set of blue vertices is a rotation of the set of red vertices.

Wait, but the rotation could be by any multiple of 45 degrees, right? Because it's a regular octagon, so there are rotations by 0째, 45째, 90째, ..., 315째, which correspond to 0, 1, 2, ..., 7 steps. So, we're considering all possible rotations, including the identity rotation (which does nothing).

So, the problem reduces to counting the number of colorings where the set of blue vertices is a rotation of the set of red vertices. So, for each coloring, if the blue set is a rotation of the red set, then such a rotation exists. So, how many such colorings are there?

Wait a minute. So, if the blue set is a rotation of the red set, then the blue set must have the same size as the red set because rotations preserve the
