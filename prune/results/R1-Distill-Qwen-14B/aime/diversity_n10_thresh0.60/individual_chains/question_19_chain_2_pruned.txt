Okay, so I have this geometry problem here. Let me read it again: 

We have triangle ABC with circumcenter O and incenter I. It's given that IA is perpendicular to OI. The circumradius is 13, and the inradius is 6. We need to find AB multiplied by AC.

Hmm, okay. Let's start by recalling some concepts. The circumradius R is 13, and the inradius r is 6. The circumradius is the radius of the circumscribed circle around the triangle, and the inradius is the radius of the inscribed circle.

We also know that IA is perpendicular to OI. So, the line from the inradius I to vertex A is perpendicular to the line from the inradius I to the circumradius O. That seems like an important piece of information. 

Let me think about the properties of the circumcenter and incenter. The circumcenter O is the intersection point of the perpendicular bisectors of the triangle, and it's equidistant from all three vertices, which is the circumradius R. The incenter I is where the angle bisectors meet and is equidistant from all three sides, that distance being the inradius r.

Since IA is perpendicular to OI, this must form a right angle somewhere. Maybe we can use some coordinate geometry here? Or perhaps there's a formula that relates these lengths and angles.

Wait, maybe it's better to consider vector approaches or coordinate geometry. Let me try to visualize this. If I can set up a coordinate system where I is at the origin or something, maybe that would simplify things.

Alternatively, maybe trigonometric identities or triangle formulas can help here. Let's think about what else we know. The problem asks for AB multiplied by AC, which is the product of two sides adjacent to vertex A. In triangle terms, that's sides b and c if we denote the sides opposite angles A, B, C as a, b, c respectively.

Wait, actually, no. In standard notation, side a is opposite angle A, side b is opposite angle B, and side c is opposite angle C. So AB would be side c, and AC would be side b. So AB · AC would be side c multiplied by side b, so bc. So the product is bc. We need to find bc.

Okay, so we need to find the product bc in triangle ABC with given R and r, and the condition that IA is perpendicular to OI.

Hmm, perhaps we can find expressions for IA and OI in terms of other known quantities.

Wait, I remember that in any triangle, the distance between the incenter and circumcenter can be expressed using the formula: OI² = R(R - 2r). Let me confirm that. Yes, Euler's formula states that OI² = R(R - 2r). So since R is 13 and r is 6, OI² = 13*(13 - 12) = 13*1 =13. So OI is sqrt(13).

Wait, that's a useful piece of information. So the length of OI is sqrt(13).

Now, we also have that IA is perpendicular to OI. So in triangle IOA, we have a right angle at I. So triangle IOA is right-angled at I. So by Pythagoras' theorem
