Okay, so I have this math problem to solve. Let me read it again carefully. It says:

"Let p be the least prime number for which there exists a positive integer n such that n⁴ + 1 is divisible by p². Find the least positive integer m such that m⁴ + 1 is divisible by p²."

Hmm, so I need to find the smallest prime p where p² divides n⁴ + 1 for some positive integer n. Then, once I find that p, I need to find the smallest m such that m⁴ + 1 is divisible by p².

First, I should understand what this means. n⁴ + 1 is congruent to 0 mod p². So, n⁴ ≡ -1 mod p². That tells me that -1 is a quartic residue modulo p². But I'm not too familiar with quartic residues, so maybe I can approach it differently.

I remember that for primes p, if p divides n⁴ + 1, then certain conditions must hold. Maybe I can start by checking small primes and see if they satisfy the condition.

Let me list some small primes: 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, etc.

First, p=2: Let's see if there's an n such that n⁴ + 1 is divisible by 2²=4. Let's try n=1: 1⁴ +1=2, which is not divisible by 4. n=2: 16 +1=17, which mod 4 is 1, not 0. n=3: 81 +1=82, mod4 is 2, not 0. n=4: 256+1=257, mod4=1. Hmm, so it seems no n satisfies this for p=2.

Wait, but n=1: 1+1=2, which is 2 mod4, not 0. p=2 doesn't work.

Next, p=3. Let's see if there's an n where n⁴ +1 is divisible by 9.

n⁴ ≡ -1 mod9.

Let me compute n⁴ mod9 for n=1 to 8 (since 9 is modulus, and φ(9)=6, maybe it's better to check up to 8).

n=1: 1⁴=1 mod9. 1+1=2≠0 mod9.

n=2: 16 mod9=7. 7+1=8≠0.

n=3: 81 mod9=0. 0+1=1≠0.

n=4: same as n=4-9= -5. (-5)^4=625 mod9. 625 /9=69*9=621, 625-621=4, so 4. 4+1=5≠0.

n=5: 5^4=625, same as above, 4 mod9. 4+1=5≠0.

n=6: 6^4=1296 mod9=0. 0+1=1≠0.

n=7: 7^4=2401. Let's divide 2401 by9: 9*266=2394, 2401-2394=7. So 7 mod9. 7+1=8≠0.

n=8: 8^4=4096. 4096 mod9: 4+0+9+6=19, 1+9=10, 1+0=1; so 1 mod9. 1+1=2≠0.

So p=3 doesn't work.

Next, p=5. So check if n⁴ +1 is divisible by 25. So n⁴ ≡ -1 mod25.

Compute n⁴ mod25 for n=1 to 24 (since φ(25)=20, so residues repeat every 20). But maybe it's quicker to check n=1 to 12 or so.

n=1: 1+1=2≠0 mod25.

n=2: 16+1=17≠0.

n=3: 81+1=82 mod25=82-3*25=82-75=7≠0.

n=4: 256 mod25. 25*10=250, 256-250=6. 6+1=7≠0.

n=5: 0+1=1≠0.

n=6: 6^4=1296. Let's compute 1296 mod25. 25*51=1275, 1296-1275=21. 21 +1=22≠0.

n=7: 7^4=2401. 2401 mod25: 25*96=2400. 2401-2400=1. 1+1=2≠0.

n=8: 8^4=4096. 4096 mod25: 25*163=4075. 4096-4075=21. 21+1=22≠0.

n=9: 9^4=6561. 6561 mod25. 25*262=6550. 6561-6550=11. 11+1=12≠0.

n=10: 10^4=10000 mod25=0. 0+1=1≠0.

n=11: 11^4=14641. Let's compute mod25. 14641 divided by25: 25*585=14625. 14641-14625=16. So 16 mod25. 16+1=17≠0.

n=12: 12^4=20736. 20736 mod25: 25*829=20725. 20736-20725=11. 11+1=12≠0.

Hmm, so far nothing. Maybe I should check n=13, but 13 mod25 is same as -12, so 13^4 is same as (-12)^4 = 12^4, which I already checked, which is 11 mod25. So same result.

Wait, maybe I'm missing something. Let me try n=14: 14^4. 14 mod25 is 14. 14^2=196 mod25=196-7*25=196-175=21. So 14^4=(14^2)^2=21^2=441 mod25. 441-17*25=441-425=16. 16+1=17≠0.

n=15: 15^4=50625 mod25=0. 0+1=1≠0.

n=16: 16^4. 16 mod25 is 16. 16^2=256 mod25=6. 16^4=6^2=36 mod25=11. 11+1=12≠0.

n=17: 17^4. 17 mod25 is 17. 17^2=289 mod25=14. 17^4=14^2=196 mod25=21. 21+1=22≠0.

n=18: 18^4. 18 mod25=18. 18^2=324 mod25=324-12*25=324-300=24. 18^4=24^2=576 mod25. 576-23*25=576-575=1. 1+1=2
