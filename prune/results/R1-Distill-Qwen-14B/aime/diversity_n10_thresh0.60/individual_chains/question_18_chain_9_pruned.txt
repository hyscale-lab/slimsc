Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the number of rectangles that can be formed inside a regular dodecagon, which is a 12-sided polygon. Each side of the rectangle has to lie on either a side or a diagonal of the dodecagon. Hmm, okay, so I need to visualize this.

First, I remember that a regular dodecagon has all its sides equal and all its internal angles equal. Each internal angle in a regular dodecagon is 150 degrees because the formula for internal angles is ((n-2)*180)/n, which for n=12 gives ((12-2)*180)/12 = (10*180)/12 = 150 degrees. But I'm not sure if that's directly useful yet.

The problem mentions that each side of the rectangle lies on either a side or a diagonal of the dodecagon. So, the sides of the rectangle are either edges of the dodecagon or its diagonals. I think this means that the vertices of the rectangle must be among the vertices of the dodecagon because the sides and diagonals connect the vertices.

Wait, rectangles have four right angles. In a regular dodecagon, sides are straight, but the diagonals can have different lengths and angles. So, for a rectangle to be formed, the opposite sides must be equal and parallel, and the angles must be 90 degrees. But in a regular dodecagon, the sides are all the same length, but diagonals can vary. So, perhaps the sides of the rectangle are formed by sides or diagonals that are spaced in a way that creates right angles.

I think I need to consider the symmetry of the dodecagon. Since it's regular, it has rotational and reflectional symmetries. So, maybe the number of rectangles can be calculated based on the distances between vertices or something like that.

Let me try to model the dodecagon. Let's label the vertices as V0, V1, V2, ..., V11 in a clockwise direction. Each vertex is equally spaced around a circle. The central angle between any two adjacent vertices is 360/12 = 30 degrees. So, the angle between V0 and V1 is 30 degrees, V0 and V2 is 60 degrees, and so on.

Now, if I pick two vertices, say Vk and Vm, the central angle between them is 30*(k - m) degrees. The chord length (which is the distance between them) depends on this angle. For a regular polygon, the chord length can be calculated using the formula 2*R*sin(θ/2), where θ is the central angle, and R is the radius of the circumscribed circle.

But maybe instead of chord lengths, I should think about how rectangles are formed. A rectangle requires four points such that their connecting lines form right angles. In a regular dodecagon, for four points to form a rectangle, the opposite sides must be parallel and equal, and the diagonals must be equal and intersect at 90 degrees, or something like that.

Wait, I'm not sure about that. Maybe it's better to think in terms of vectors. For four points A, B, C
