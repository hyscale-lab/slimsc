Okay, so I need to solve this math problem about Aya's morning walk. Let me read it again and try to understand what's being asked.

Every morning, Aya goes for a 9-kilometer-long walk and stops at a coffee shop afterwards. The problem gives me two different scenarios about her walking speed and the time it takes, including the time she spends in the coffee shop. I need to find out how long her walk will take if she walks at a speed that's halfway between her original speed and the increased speed. Let me break this down.

First, let me note down the given information:

1. When she walks at a constant speed of 's' kilometers per hour, the total time taken is 4 hours. This time includes 't' minutes spent in the coffee shop.
2. When she increases her speed to 's + 2' kilometers per hour, the total time taken is 2 hours and 24 minutes, which still includes the same 't' minutes in the coffee shop.
3. We are asked to find the total time when she walks at 's + 1/2' kilometers per hour, again including 't' minutes.

Hmm, okay. So, the key here is to find the values of 's' and 't' first. Once I have those, I can compute the time when her speed is 's + 1/2'.

Let me think about how to model this. Since the distance is constant at 9 km, I can use the formula: time = distance/speed. But wait, the time given includes both the walking time and the coffee shop time. So, the actual walking time would be the total time minus 't' minutes.

Wait, but 't' is given in minutes, and the other times are in hours. Maybe I should convert all times to the same unit, either hours or minutes. Let me go with hours because the speed is in km per hour.

So, converting 't' minutes to hours: t minutes is t/60 hours.

For the first scenario:
- Walking speed = s km/h
- Total time = 4 hours
- Walking time = total time - coffee time = 4 - (t/60)
- The distance is 9 km, so walking time = 9 / s
- So, 9/s = 4 - (t/60)

Similarly, for the second scenario:
- Walking speed = s + 2 km/h
- Total time = 2 hours 24 minutes. Let me convert that to hours. 24 minutes is 24/60 = 0.4 hours. So total time is 2.4 hours.
- Walking time = 2.4 - (t/60)
- Distance is still 9 km, so walking time = 9 / (s + 2)
- So, 9/(s + 2) = 2.4 - (t/60)

Now I have two equations:

1. 9/s = 4 - (t/60)
2. 9/(s + 2) = 2.4 - (t/60)

I need to solve these two equations to find 's' and 't'. Once I have those, the third scenario is when speed is s + 1/2 km/h. The walking time in that case would be 9/(s + 1/2), and the total time including coffee is that plus t/60 hours. Then, I can convert that to minutes if needed.

Let me write the equations again:

Equation 1: 9/s = 4 - (t/60)
Equation 2: 9/(s + 2) = 2.4 - (t/60)

Hmm, perhaps I can subtract these two equations to eliminate 't'. Let me rearrange both equations to express (t/60):

From Equation 1:
t/60 = 4 - (9/s)

From Equation 2:
t/60 = 2.4 - (9/(s + 2))

Since both equal t/60, I can set them equal to each other:

4 - (9/s) = 2.4 - (9/(s + 2))

Let me write that down:

4 - (9/s) = 2.4 - (9/(s + 2))

Now, I can solve for 's'. Let me move all terms to one side:

4 - 2.4 = 9/s - 9/(s + 2)

Calculating 4 - 2.4: that's 1.6.

So:

1.6 = 9/s - 9/(s + 2)

Let me factor out the 9:

1.6 = 9 [ 1/s - 1/(s + 2) ]

Compute 1/s - 1/(s + 2):

That's [ (s + 2) - s ] / [s(s + 2)] = 2 / [s(s + 2)]

So,

1.6 = 9 * [2 / (s(s + 2))]

Simplify:

1.6 = 18 / [s(s + 2)]

Multiply both sides by s(s + 2):

1.6 * s(s + 2) = 18

Divide both sides by 1.6:

s(s + 2) = 18 / 1.6

Calculate 18 divided by 1.6:

1.6 goes into 18 how many times? 1.6 * 11 = 17.6, which is close. 18 - 17.6 = 0.4. So, 0.4 /1.6 = 0.25. So, 11.25.

So, s(s + 2) = 11.25

Which is s^2 + 2s - 11.25 = 0

Now, solving this quadratic equation:

s^2 + 2s - 11.25 = 0

Using quadratic formula: s = [ -2 Â± sqrt(4 + 45) ] / 2

Because discriminant D = 4 + 4 * 1 * 11.25 = 4 + 45 = 49.

So, sqrt(49) = 7.

Thus, s = [ -2 + 7 ] / 2 = 5 / 2 = 2.5 or s = [ -2 -7 ] /2 = -9/2 = -4.5

Since speed can't be negative, s = 2.5 km/h.

Wait, that seems a bit slow for a walking speed, but okay, maybe she walks slowly.

So, s = 2.5 km/h.

Now, let's find 't' using one of the equations.

Let's use Equation 1: t/60 = 4 - (9/s)

s is 2.5, so 9/s = 9 / 2.5 = 3.6 hours.

So,

t/60 = 4 - 3.6 = 0.4

Multiply both sides by 60: t = 0.4 * 60 =
