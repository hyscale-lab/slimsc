Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the number of rectangles that can be formed inside a regular dodecagon. Each side of the rectangle must lie on either a side or a diagonal of the dodecagon. Hmm, that's interesting. I remember that a dodecagon has 12 sides, so it's a 12-sided polygon. 

First, let me visualize a regular dodecagon. It's a twelve-sided polygon with all sides equal and all internal angles equal. Each internal angle in a regular dodecagon is 150 degrees, I think. But maybe that's not so important right now. What matters is that it has 12 vertices, and from each vertex, you can draw diagonals to other vertices, except the ones adjacent to it.

The problem is about rectangles formed by sides or diagonals of the dodecagon. So, each rectangle's sides must be either sides of the dodecagon or its diagonals. I suppose the key here is that the sides of the rectangle must be aligned with the sides or diagonals of the dodecagon.

Wait, but how do diagonals in a regular polygon form rectangles? I think that in regular polygons, certain diagonals can be parallel, creating sides of rectangles. So, maybe if I can find pairs of parallel sides or diagonals, those can form the opposite sides of a rectangle. Then, the other two sides of the rectangle would be another pair of parallel lines, perhaps of a different length or direction.

So, perhaps the idea is to find all possible pairs of parallel lines in the dodecagon and then see how they can form rectangles. But I need to be systematic about this.

Let me think about the structure of a regular dodecagon. Each vertex can be connected to several others via sides or diagonals. The sides connect each vertex to its immediate neighbor, and the diagonals connect to vertices further away. The number of different lengths of diagonals can be determined by how many vertices they skip.

In a regular n-gon, the number of different diagonal lengths is (n-3)/2 if n is odd, but for even n, it's (n/2 -1). Wait, for n=12, which is even, the number of different diagonal lengths would be (12/2 -1)=5. So, diagonals can have lengths corresponding to skipping 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5 vertices. Wait, but in a dodecagon, the maximum number of vertices you can skip is 5, because skipping 6 would bring you back along the other side. So, there are diagonals that skip 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5 vertices.

But not all of these diagonals are unique in length, right? Because in a regular polygon, diagonals that skip k vertices are congruent to those that skip (n - k - 2) vertices. Wait, maybe not exactly. Wait, for a regular polygon with an even number of sides, some diagonals have the same length.

Wait, maybe it's better to think in terms of the central angles. Each side corresponds to a central angle of 360/12=30 degrees. So, each diagonal that skips k vertices corresponds to a central angle of (
