Okay, I'm going to try to solve this problem. It involves functions f(x) and g(x), and finding the number of intersections between two graphs. The functions are defined as f(x) = ||x| - 1/2| and g(x) = ||x| - 1/4|. Then, the two graphs are y = 4g(f(sin(2πx))) and x = 4g(f(cos(3πy))). I need to find how many points these two graphs intersect.

Hmm, so first, let me understand what f and g look like. Maybe if I can graph them, it might help me figure out the behavior of the composite functions involved.

Starting with f(x) = ||x| - 1/2|. The absolute value function |x| creates a V-shape. Subtracting 1/2 shifts it down by 1/2 unit, and then taking the absolute value again will reflect any negative parts upwards. So f(x) is a V-shape that's been shifted and then reflected. Let's think about key points. When x is 0, |0| is 0. Then 0 - 1/2 is -1/2, and the absolute value of that is 1/2. So f(0) = 1/2.

When x is 1/2, |1/2| = 1/2. Subtract 1/2, get 0. Absolute value of 0 is 0. So f(1/2) = 0. Similarly, f(-1/2) is also 0. What about x = 1? |1| = 1, minus 1/2 is 1/2, absolute is 1/2. So f(1) = 1/2. Similarly, x = -1, same value. So f(x) has a V-shape with the minimum at x = ±1/2, where it's 0, and it reaches 1/2 at x=0,1,-1, etc.

Similarly, g(x) = ||x| - 1/4|. Let's plot that. At x=0, |0| - 1/4 is -1/4, absolute gives 1/4. So g(0) = 1/4. At x=1/4, |1/4| is 1/4. Subtract 1/4, get 0. Absolute is 0. So g(1/4) = 0. Similarly, x=-1/4 is 0. At x=1/2, |1/2| is 1/2, minus 1/4 is 1/4, so g(1/2) = 1/4. So g(x) has a V-shape with minima at x=±1/4, zero there, and peaks at 1/4 elsewhere, like x=0, x=1/2, etc.

Now, since f and g are both functions that take absolute values, their compositions will also have similar properties, but with different periods and so on. The problem involves f(sin(2πx)) and g applied to that, and similarly g(f(cos(3πy))). 

Wait, the functions are 4g(f(sin(2πx))) for y, and x is equal to 4g(f(cos(3πy))). So I have y = 4g(f(sin(2πx))) and x =4g(f(cos(3πy))). So I need to find all (x,y) pairs where both equations are satisfied.

That is, for each x, y is determined by the first equation, and then x is determined by the second equation with that y. Alternatively, perhaps I can set them equal in some way?

Wait no, because the first equation expresses y in terms of x, and the second expresses x in terms of y. So to find the intersection points, I need to find all (x,y) such that y = 4g(f(sin(2πx))) and x=4g(f(cos(3πy))).

So substituting y from the first into the second, I can write x = 4g(f(cos(3πy))) where y is itself 4g(f(sin(2πx))). So x = 4g(f(cos(3π*(4g(f(sin(2πx))))))). That seems complicated, but maybe we can find a way to analyze it.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to analyze the functions step by step. Let's first consider 4g(f(sin(2πx))). Let me understand what this function looks like.

First, sin(2πx) is a sine wave with period 1, since the period of sin(2πx) is 1. So over each integer interval, it completes a full cycle.

Then, f is applied to sin(2πx). So f(sin(2πx)) = ||sin(2πx)| - 1/2|. Let's think about sin(2πx): it's a wave that goes from -1 to 1. Taking absolute value, |sin(2πx)| is between 0 and 1. Then subtracting 1/2, so |sin(2πx)| - 1/2 can range from -1/2 to 1/2. Taking absolute value again, f(sin(2πx)) will be between 0 and 1/2. So f(sin(2πx)) ∈ [0, 1/2].

Then, g is applied to that. Since g(x) = ||x| - 1/4|, and the input to g is now in [0, 1/2], let's compute g on this interval. For x in [0,1/2], |x| is x, so |x| -1/4 is x - 1/4. For x >= 1/4, x -1/4 >=0, so g(x) = x - 1/4. For x < 1/4, |x| -1/4 is negative, so g(x) = -(x -1/4) = 1/4 -x.

So for f(sin(2πx)) in [0,1/2], g(f(sin(2πx))) is:

If f(sin(2πx)) >=1/4, which is f(sin(2πx)) ∈ [1/4, 1/2], then g(f(...)) = f(...) -1/4.

If f(...) <1/4, which is [0,1/4), then g(f(...)) =1/4 - f(...).

So, 4g(f(...)) will be 4*(f(...) -1/4) when f(...) >=1/4, which gives 4f(...) -1, and 4*(1/4 -f(...)) =1 -4f(...) when f(...) <1/4.

So 4g(f(...)) can take values:

When f(...) is in [1/4,1/2], 4g(...) ranges from 4*(1/4) -1= 0 to 4*(1/2)-1= 1.

When f(...) is in [0,1/4), 4g(...) ranges from 4*(1/4 -0)=1 down to 4*(1/4 -1/4)=0? Wait, no. Wait, when f(...) approaches 0, 4g(f(...)) approaches 4*(1/4 -0) =1. When f(...) approaches 1/4, 4g(f(...)) approaches 4*(1/4 -1/4)=0. So in the interval [0,1/4), 4g(f(...)) is in (0,1].

Wait, that's a bit confusing. Let me make a table.

f(...) = t, where t ∈ [0, 1/2].

g(t) = | |t| -1/4 |. Since t is non-negative, it's |t - 1/4|.

So if t >=1/4, g(t)= t -1/4.

If t <1/4, g(t)=1/4 -t.

So, 4g(t) is:

If t >=1/4, 4*(t -1/4) =4t -1.

If t <1/4, 4*(1/4 -t) =1 -4t.

So 4g(t) is a piecewise function: 1 -4t for t <1/4, and 4t -1 for t >=1/4.

So, for t ∈ [0,1/4), 4g(t) =1 -4t, which decreases from 1 to 0 as
