Okay, so I have this math problem to solve. Let me read it again to make sure I understand what's being asked.

The problem says: Let p be the least prime number for which there exists a positive integer n such that n⁴ + 1 is divisible by p². Then, I need to find the least positive integer m such that m⁴ + 1 is divisible by p².

Hmm, okay. So the first part is about finding the smallest prime p where n⁴ + 1 is divisible by p squared. Then, once I find that prime p, I need to find the smallest m where m⁴ + 1 is divisible by p².

I remember that primes for which -1 is a quartic residue are important here. Because if n⁴ ≡ -1 mod p², then n⁴ + 1 ≡ 0 mod p². So, n is a solution to the congruence n⁴ ≡ -1 mod p².

I think the first step is to find the smallest prime p where n⁴ ≡ -1 mod p² has a solution. Then, for that p, find the smallest m satisfying the same.

I recall that for primes p, if p ≡ 1 mod 8, then -1 is a quartic residue mod p. Because the multiplicative group mod p is cyclic of order p-1, so if 4 divides p-1, then there exists solutions to x⁴ ≡ -1 mod p. Since -1 is equivalent to multiplying by i², but maybe I should think in terms of group theory.

Wait, let me think again. The multiplicative group mod p is cyclic of order p-1. So, the equation x⁴ = -1 mod p has a solution only if the order of -1 divides (p-1)/2, because -1 has order 2. So, for x⁴ = -1 to have a solution, 2 must divide (p-1)/gcd(4, p-1). Hmm, maybe I need to approach this differently.

Alternatively, since x⁴ ≡ -1 mod p implies x⁸ ≡ 1 mod p. So, the order of x mod p divides 8, but since x⁴ ≡ -1, the order must be 8. Therefore, 8 must divide p-1, because the multiplicative group mod p has order p-1, so the order of any element divides p-1. So, 8 divides p-1, meaning p ≡ 1 mod 8.

So, primes p ≡ 1 mod 8 are candidates. The smallest primes congruent to 1 mod 8 are 17, 97,  etc. Wait, no: 17 is 1 mod 16, but mod 8, 17 is 1 as well. Wait, let's list primes mod 8:

Primes: 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, etc.

Mod 8, these are: 2, 3, 5, 7, 3
