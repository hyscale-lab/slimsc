Okay, so I have this math problem here. It says: Let p be the least prime number for which there exists a positive integer n such that n⁴ + 1 is divisible by p². Then, I need to find the least positive integer m such that m⁴ + 1 is divisible by p².

Hmm, okay. Let me try to break this down. First, I need to find the smallest prime p where p² divides n⁴ + 1 for some positive integer n. Then, once I have that p, I need to find the smallest m that satisfies m⁴ ≡ -1 mod p².

I remember that for primes p, if p divides n⁴ + 1, then n⁸ ≡ 1 mod p, which means the order of n modulo p divides 8. But wait, since n⁴ ≡ -1 mod p, the order can't be 4 because (-1)^2 = 1, so the order would actually be 8. Therefore, 8 must divide p-1, so p ≡ 1 mod 8.

But wait, p² needs to divide n⁴ +1. So, maybe I'm looking for primes where n⁴ ≡ -1 mod p², not just mod p. That might be more restrictive.

I've heard about primes where -1 is a quartic residue modulo p². So, such a prime p must satisfy certain conditions.

Let me recall Hensel's lemma, which is about lifting solutions from modulo p to modulo higher powers. So, if n⁴ ≡ -1 mod p has a solution, does it necessarily lift to a solution modulo p²? Not always. Hensel's lemma says that if the derivative of f(x) = x⁴ +1 is not zero modulo p at the root, then the solution can be lifted. The derivative is 4x³. So, for the derivative to not be zero mod p, we need 4x³ ≡ 0 mod p, which would mean x ≡ 0 mod p. But x is a solution to x⁴ ≡ -1 mod p, so x can't be 0 mod p. Therefore, the derivative is non-zero mod p, which implies that if there is a solution mod p, it can be uniquely lifted to a solution mod p².

Wait, but hold on. So, if p is a prime where -1 is a quartic residue mod p, then there exists a solution mod p, which can be lifted to mod p². Therefore, for primes p ≡ 1 mod 8, maybe?

But wait, p=17: let me check. Let me think about small primes. The small primes are 2,3,5,7,11,13,17, etc.

Let me check for p=2. Does 2²=4 divide n⁴ +1 for some n? Let's see, n=1: 1+1=2. 2 mod4 is 2, so no. n=2: 16 +1=17, 17 mod4 is 1, nope. n=3: 81+1=82, which mod
