Okay, so I have this problem about rectangular boxes with a given surface area and volume, and I need to find the radius of the smallest sphere that can contain each of these boxes. Then, I have to express r squared as a fraction p/q and find p+q. Hmm, let me try to break this down.

First, let's note the given information. The surface area of each box is 54, and the volume is 23. So, for a rectangular box with length, width, and height denoted as x, y, z, respectively, the surface area S is given by:

S = 2(xy + yz + zx) = 54

And the volume V is:

V = xyz = 23

We're supposed to find the smallest sphere that can contain each such box. The sphere's radius will be determined by the largest distance from the center of the sphere to any corner of the box. Since the sphere has to contain the entire box, the radius will be half the space diagonal of the box. So, the space diagonal d of the box is sqrt(x² + y² + z²), and the radius r is d/2. Therefore, r² would be (x² + y² + z²)/4.

So, our goal is to minimize r², which is equivalent to minimizing x² + y² + z² given the constraints on surface area and volume.

So, to rephrase, we need to minimize f(x, y, z) = x² + y² + z², subject to the constraints:

1. 2(xy + yz + zx) = 54
2. xyz = 23

This sounds like an optimization problem with two constraints. I think I can use the method of Lagrange multipliers for this, but since I'm dealing with multiple variables and multiple constraints, it might get a bit complicated. Alternatively, maybe I can express some variables in terms of others using the constraints and then substitute them into the function to minimize.

Let me consider using Lagrange multipliers. Let’s denote the two constraints as g(x, y, z) = 2(xy + yz + zx) -54 = 0 and h(x, y, z) = xyz -23 = 0.

We want to minimize f(x, y, z) with the constraints g = 0 and h = 0. So, we can set up the Lagrangian:

L = x² + y² + z² - λ(2(xy + yz + zx) -54) - μ(xyz -23)

Then, we take partial derivatives with respect to x, y, z, λ, μ and set them to zero.

Partial derivatives:

dL/dx = 2x - λ(2y + 2z) - μ(yz) = 0
dL/dy = 2y - λ(2x + 2z) - μ(xz) = 0
dL/dz = 2z - λ(2x + 2y) - μ(xy) = 0
dg = 2(xy + yz + zx) -54 = 0
dh = xyz -23 = 0

So, the first three equations are:

1. 2x - 2λ(y + z) - μyz = 0
2. 2y - 2λ(x + z) - μxz = 0
3. 2z - 2λ(x + y) - μxy = 0

Hmm, these equations look symmetric. Maybe the variables x, y, z are proportional or have some symmetry. Let me consider whether the minimal case occurs when x = y = z. But wait, if x = y = z, then it's a cube. Let's check if that's possible.

If x = y = z = a, then surface area S = 2(3a²) = 6a² =54 → a²=9 → a=3. Then volume V = a³=27. But in our problem
