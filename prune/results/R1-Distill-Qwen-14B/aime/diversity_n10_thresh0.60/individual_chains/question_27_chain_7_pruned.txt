Okay, so I'm trying to solve this problem about a torus and a sphere. Let me read it again to make sure I understand.

We have a torus T, which is created by revolving a circle of radius 3 around an axis in the plane of the circle. The distance from the center of this circle to the axis is 6. So, it's like a donut shape. Then there's a sphere S with radius 11.

When the torus rests inside the sphere, it's internally tangent along a circle with radius r_i. When it's outside, it's externally tangent along a circle with radius r_o. We need to find the difference r_i - r_o, express it as a fraction m/n where m and n are coprime, and then find m + n.

Hmm, okay. So, I think I need to visualize the torus and the sphere. The torus is a surface of revolution, so it's symmetric around the axis. The sphere is also symmetric, so the points of tangency will form circles on both the torus and the sphere.

Let me recall some properties of tori. The standard torus can be described using two radii: the major radius R, which is the distance from the center of the generating circle to the axis of revolution, and the minor radius r, which is the radius of the generating circle. In this case, R is 6, and r is 3.

The sphere has radius 11. So, when the torus is inside the sphere, they're tangent, and when it's outside, they're also tangent, but in the opposite way.

I think the key here is to find the radii of the circles where the torus is tangent to the sphere in both cases. These radii r_i and r_o must correspond to the points where the surfaces just touch each other.

Let me try to model this. Maybe I should think in terms of the centers of the generating circles of the torus. Each point on the torus can be represented in polar coordinates, but perhaps it's better to use some geometric reasoning.

When the torus is inside the sphere, the closest point on the torus to the center of the sphere will be at a certain distance. Similarly, the farthest point when the torus is outside.

Wait, but since the torus is a surface, when it's inside the sphere, the internal tangent will occur where the sphere and torus just touch, meaning the distance from the sphere's center to that point on the torus is equal to the sphere's radius, which is 11.

Similarly, when the torus is outside, the distance from the sphere's center to the point of tangency will be equal to the sum of the sphere's radius and the torus' "radius" in that direction.

Wait, perhaps I should model the torus mathematically. The equation of a torus can be given in 3D coordinates. Let me recall that the standard equation for a torus with major radius R and minor radius r is:

(√(x² + y²) - R)² + z² = r².

But in our case, the torus is axisymmetric around the z-axis, I think. Wait, actually, in the problem statement, the axis of revolution is in the plane of the circle being revolved. So, maybe the torus is formed by rotating a circle in the x-y plane around the z-axis? Or another axis?

Wait, the problem says: "the axis in the plane of the circle that is a distance 6 from the center of the circle." So, imagine a circle in the plane, say the x-y plane, centered at (6, 0) on the x-axis. So, the circle has radius 3, and is centered at (6,0) in the x-y plane. Revolving this circle around the x-axis (which is the axis at distance 6 from the center) would produce a torus.

Alternatively, perhaps it's revolved around the z-axis, but regardless, the major radius R is 6, and the minor radius r is 3.

So
