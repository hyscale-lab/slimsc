Okay, so I've got this problem here about a convex equilateral hexagon. All the sides are equal, and each pair of opposite sides is parallel. The hexagon is labeled ABCDEF, which probably means the sides are AB, BC, CD, DE, EF, and FA. Since it's convex and equilateral, all the sides are the same length, which I'll call 's'. 

Hmm, the problem mentions a triangle formed by extending the sides AB, CD, and EF. These extensions form a triangle with side lengths 200, 240, and 300. I need to find the side length 's' of the hexagon.

First, I should visualize this hexagon. Since it's convex and equilateral with opposite sides parallel, it's probably similar to a regular hexagon but scaled somehow. Wait, in a regular hexagon, all sides are equal and all opposite sides are parallel, so this must be a more general version, maybe with different angles but sides all equal.

Now, when they talk about extending AB, CD, and EF to form a triangle, it's like those three sides, when extended beyond the hexagon, meet each other to form a larger triangle. So, each of these sides is being extended, and where they meet, they form a triangle with sides 200, 240, and 300. 

I think this means that each of AB, CD, EF is a side of the hexagon, and when you extend them, the lines intersect to form the triangle. The triangle's sides correspond to the extensions. Since the hexagon is convex, the extensions must go outward, forming a triangle outside the hexagon.

Wait, maybe I should think about similar triangles here. If AB, CD, EF are all equal and their extensions form a triangle, perhaps the hexagon is similar to the larger triangle but scaled down.

Alternatively, maybe the triangle is an affine transformation of the hexagon. Hmm, not sure about that.

Let me try to break down the problem. Let's denote the triangle formed by the extensions as triangle XYZ, where XY = 200, YZ = 240, and XZ = 300. So, each of the sides of this triangle corresponds to the extension of AB, CD, and EF.

Since the hexagon is equilateral, each side is length 's'. But when these sides are extended, they form
