Okay, so I have this geometry problem here, and I need to figure out the length of CE. Let me read it again to make sure I understand all the details.

We have two rectangles, ABCD and EFGH. Points D, E, C, F are collinear. Also, points A, D, H, G all lie on a circle. The given lengths are BC = 16, AB = 107, FG = 17, and EF = 184. I need to find CE.

Hmm, okay. Let me try to visualize this. Rectangles ABCD and EFGH. So ABCD has sides AB, BC, CD, DA. Similarly, EFGH has sides EF, FG, GH, HE. Since D, E, C, F are collinear, that means they all lie on a straight line. So, line DEF C is a straight line.

Also, points A, D, H, G lie on a circle. So, there's a cyclic quadrilateral ADHG. Interesting. So, A, D, H, G are concyclic.

I think drawing a diagram would help, but since I can't draw, I'll try to imagine it. Let's suppose that rectangle ABCD is positioned such that side BC is vertical and AB is horizontal. So, point A is bottom-left, B is bottom-right, C is top-right, D is top-left. Then, rectangle EFGH is another rectangle, possibly overlapping or adjacent.

Wait, but D, E, C, F are collinear. So, point E is somewhere on the line extending from D through C to F. So, if I have rectangle ABCD, with D at the top-left corner, and C at the top-right, then E must be either to the left of D or to the right of C, and F is another point on the same line.

Wait, but E is a vertex of rectangle EFGH. So, E is a corner. Hmm. Let me try to think about the positions.

Maybe the line DEF C is a straight line, with D and C being adjacent corners of their rectangle, and E and F being adjacent corners of the other rectangle. So, perhaps E is next to D, and F is next to C.

But wait, in rectangle EFGH, sides EF and FG are given. So, EF is one side, which is 184, and FG is 17. So, EF is the horizontal side, and FG is the vertical side if the rectangle is placed with EF as the base.

Wait, but if E is connected to F, then EF is 184, so E and F are connected by a side of length 184. Then, F is connected to G and H. Hmm. So, if D, E, C, F are collinear, then E must be on the line DC extended.

Wait, maybe I should assign coordinates to these points to make it easier. Let me set up a coordinate system.

Let me place point D at the origin (0, 0) for simplicity. Then, since ABCD is a rectangle, if D is at (0, 0), then C would be at (c, 0), B at (c, b), and A at (0, b
