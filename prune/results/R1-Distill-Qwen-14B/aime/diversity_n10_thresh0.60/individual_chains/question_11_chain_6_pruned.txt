Okay, so I've got this complex number problem here. Let me read it again to make sure I understand. The problem says:

Find the largest possible real part of \[(75 + 117i)z + \frac{96 + 144i}{z}\] where \( z \) is a complex number with \( |z| = 4 \).

Hmm, okay. So I need to maximize the real part of this expression. Let me break it down.

First, \( z \) is a complex number with magnitude 4. So \( |z| = 4 \). That means \( z \) can be written in the form \( z = 4e^{i\theta} \), where \( \theta \) is the argument of \( z \). Alternatively, \( z \) can be expressed as \( a + bi \) where \( a^2 + b^2 = 16 \). But maybe using the exponential form will be easier here because it relates to the angle.

So, the expression is \( (75 + 117i)z + \frac{96 + 144i}{z} \). Let me think about how to handle this. Since \( z \) has magnitude 4, then \( 1/z = \overline{z}/|z|^2 \). Because for any complex number \( z = a + bi \), \( 1/z = \overline{z}/|z|^2 \).

So, given \( |z| = 4 \), \( |z|^2 = 16 \). Therefore, \( 1/z = \overline{z}/16 \).

Let me write that down:

\( \frac{1}{z} = \frac{\overline{z}}{16} \).

So, substituting into the original expression:

\( (75 + 117i)z + \frac{96 + 144i}{z} = (75 + 117i)z + (96 + 144i)\frac{\overline{z}}{16} \).

Let me compute each term separately.

First, expand the second term:

\( (96 + 144i)\frac{\overline{z}}{16} = \left( \frac{96}{16} + \frac{144}{16}i \right)\overline{z} = (6 + 9i)\overline{z} \).

So now, the expression becomes:

\( (75 + 117i)z + (6 + 9i)\overline{z} \).

Hmm, so it's a combination of \( z \) and its conjugate \( \overline{z} \). Maybe I can express this in terms of \( z \) and \( \overline{z} \), and then use the fact that \( |z| = 4 \), which relates \( z \) and \( \overline{z} \).

Let me write \( z = re^{i\theta} \), but since \( |z| = 4 \), \( r = 4 \). So \( z = 4e^{i\theta} \), and \( \overline{z} = 4e^{-i\theta} \).

Substituting these into the expression:

\( (75 + 117i)4e^{i\theta} + (6 + 9i)4e^{-i\theta} \).

Let me factor out the 4:

\( 4[(75 + 117i)e^{i\theta} + (6 + 9i)e^{-i\theta}] \).

Hmm, so now the expression is a linear combination of \( e^{i\theta} \) and \( e^{-i\theta} \). Let me denote this as 4 times [A e^{iθ} + B e^{-iθ} }, where A = 75 + 117i and B = 6 +9i.

Wait, alternatively, maybe I can write this as a single exponential or something. Alternatively, I can express the entire expression in terms of sine and cosine.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to represent z as 4e^{iθ}, and then compute each term's real part.

Let me expand each term.

First, compute \( (75 + 117i)4e^{i\theta} \).

Let me factor out the 4:

4*(75 +117i)*e^{iθ} = 4*(75 +117i)(cosθ + i sinθ).

Similarly, the second term is 4*(6 +9i)*e^{-iθ} = 4*(6 +9i)(cosθ - i sinθ).

Alternatively, perhaps I can write each complex number in polar form. Let me see.

Wait, maybe another approach is better. Let me think about the expression:

\( (75 + 117i)z + (6 +9i)\overline{z} \).

Since \( z = 4e^{iθ} \), then \( \overline{z} = 4e^{-iθ} \).

So, substituting:

\( (75 + 117i)4e^{iθ} + (6 +9i)4e^{-iθ} \).

Factor out the 4:

4*[ (75 + 117i)e^{iθ} + (6 +9i)e^{-iθ} ].

Hmm, perhaps I can write this as 4*[C e^{iθ} + D e^{-iθ}], where C = 75 +117i and D=6 +9i.

Alternatively, perhaps I can compute each term's expression in terms of cosθ and sinθ.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to let me define u = e^{iθ}, so that \( \overline{u} = e^{-iθ} \). Then, the expression becomes:

4*[ (75 + 117i)u + (6 +9i)\overline{u} ].

Let me denote u = cosθ + i sinθ, so \( \overline{u} = cosθ - i sinθ \).

So, substituting:

4
