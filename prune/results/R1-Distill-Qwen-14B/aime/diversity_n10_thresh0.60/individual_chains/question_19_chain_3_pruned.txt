Okay, so I've got this geometry problem about triangle ABC. Let me parse the information given. The triangle has a circumcenter O and an incenter I. It's given that IA is perpendicular to OI. The circumradius is 13, and the inradius is 6. I need to find the product AB·AC.

Hmm, where do I start? I remember that the circumradius R is 13, so that relates to the sides of the triangle somehow. The inradius r is 6, which also relates to the area and the semiperimeter. And the condition IA perpendicular to OI seems important.

First, let me recall some formulas. The area of triangle ABC can be expressed in terms of the inradius and the semiperimeter: Area = r * s, where s is the semiperimeter. Also, the area can be expressed using the circumradius and the sides: Area = (a * b * c) / (4R), where a, b, c are the sides opposite angles A, B, C respectively.

So, if I can find the semiperimeter s and the sides a, b, c, maybe I can find AB·AC. But I need more information.

Wait, the condition IA perpendicular to OI. I know that in a triangle, the incenter I is the intersection of the angle bisectors, and the circumcenter O is the intersection of the perpendicular bisectors. IA is the angle bisector from A, and OI is the line connecting the circumcenter and incenter.

I think there might be some relation or formula that connects the inradius, circumradius, and the distance between incenter and circumradius. Maybe the formula involving OI^2 = R(R - 2r). Let me check that.

Yes, I recall the formula: OI² = R² - 2Rr. So, OI² = 13² - 2*13*6 = 169 - 156 = 13. Therefore, OI = sqrt(13).

But wait, in this problem, IA is perpendicular to OI. So, triangle IAO is a right-angled triangle at I. So, in triangle IAO, IA is perpendicular to OI, meaning that angle at I is 90 degrees.

So, in triangle IAO, by Pythagoras theorem, OA² = IA² + OI².

But OA is the circumradius, so OA
