Okay, so I have this problem here where I need to find the value of xy, given that log base x of y^x is equal to 10 and log base y of x^{4y} is also equal to 10. Both x and y are greater than 1. Hmm, okay. Let me try to break this down step by step.

First, I remember that logarithms can be tricky, but they have some properties that might help here. Let me recall the basic logarithm properties. One key property is that log_b(a^c) = c * log_b(a). So, if I have log_x(y^x), I can rewrite that as x * log_x(y). Similarly, log_y(x^{4y}) would be 4y * log_y(x). 

So, the problem gives me two equations:

1. log_x(y^x) = 10, which becomes x * log_x(y) = 10.
2. log_y(x^{4y}) = 10, which becomes 4y * log_y(x) = 10.

Let me write these down:

Equation 1: x * log_x(y) = 10.

Equation 2: 4y * log_y(x) = 10.

Now, I need to find xy. So, maybe if I can express both x and y in terms of each other, I can solve for one and then find the other.

Wait, another logarithm property: log_b(a) = 1 / log_a(b). So, log_x(y) is the reciprocal of log_y(x). That's useful because in Equation 1 and Equation 2, I have both log_x(y) and log_y(x), which are reciprocals of each other.

Let me denote log_x(y) as k. Then, log_y(x) would be 1/k.

So, substituting into the equations:

Equation 1: x * k = 10.

Equation 2: 4y * (1/k) = 10.

So now I have two equations with variables x, y, and k. Maybe I can express x and y in terms of k and then find a relationship between them.

From Equation 1: x = 10 / k.

From Equation 2: 4y / k = 10 → 4y = 10k → y = (10k)/4 → y = (5k)/2.

So now, I have x expressed as 10/k and y as (5k)/2.

But wait, I also know that log_x(y) = k. Let's write that as an equation.

log_x(y) = k → log_{10/k} (5k/2) = k.

Hmm, that looks a bit complicated, but maybe I can convert the logarithmic equation into its exponential form. Remember that log_b(a) = c means that b^c = a.

So, (10/k)^k = 5k/2.

Hmm, that seems like a tough equation to solve. Maybe I can take natural logarithms on both sides to simplify.

Taking ln on both sides:

k * ln(10/k) = ln(5k/2).

Let me expand both sides.

Left side: k * [ln(10) - ln(k)].

Right side: ln(5) + ln(k) - ln(2).

So, the equation becomes:

k * [ln(10) - ln(k)] = ln(5) + ln(k) - ln(2).

Hmm, let me write that out:

k ln(10) - k ln(k) = ln(5) + ln(k) - ln(2).

I can bring all terms to one side:

k ln(10) - k ln(k) - ln(5) - ln(k) + ln(2) = 0.

Factor out ln(k):

k ln(10) - (k + 1) ln(k) - ln
