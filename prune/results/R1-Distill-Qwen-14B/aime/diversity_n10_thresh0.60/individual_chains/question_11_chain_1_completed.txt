Alright, so I've got this problem here: I need to find the largest possible real part of the expression (75 + 117i)z + (96 + 144i)/z, where z is a complex number with |z| = 4. Hmm, okay, let's break this down and think through it step by step.

First, I know that z is a complex number with magnitude 4. So I can represent z as 4e^{iθ}, where θ is the argument of z. That might make things easier because then I can express everything in terms of θ, which is a real number between 0 and 2π.

So, let me write z as 4e^{iθ}. Then, 1/z would be (1/4)e^{-iθ} since 1/z = \overline{z}/|z|². So, that part seems manageable.

Now, let's substitute z into the expression. The first term is (75 + 117i)z. Let's compute that:

(75 + 117i) * 4e^{iθ} = 4*(75 + 117i)e^{iθ}.

Similarly, the second term is (96 + 144i)/z, which is (96 + 144i)*(1/4)e^{-iθ} = (24 + 36i)e^{-iθ}.

So, putting it all together, the entire expression becomes:

4*(75 + 117i)e^{iθ} + (24 + 36i)e^{-iθ}.

Now, I need to find the real part of this expression. To do that, I can express each term in terms of cosine and sine using Euler's formula: e^{iθ} = cosθ + i sinθ, and similarly for e^{-iθ}.

Let me handle each term separately.

First term: 4*(75 + 117i)e^{iθ}.

Let me compute 4*(75 + 117i) first. 4*75 is 300, and 4*117 is 468. So that term is 300 + 468i. Multiplying by e^{iθ} gives (300 + 468i)(cosθ + i sinθ). Let's expand this:

300 cosθ + 300i sinθ + 468i cosθ + 468i² sinθ.

But i² is -1, so that becomes:

300 cosθ + 300i sinθ + 468i cosθ - 468 sinθ.

Now, let's separate the real and imaginary parts:

Real part: 300 cosθ - 468 sinθ.

Imaginary part: 300 sinθ + 468 cosθ.

Since we're only interested in the real part of the entire expression, I can note the real part from the first term and move on to the second term.

Second term: (24 + 36i)e^{-iθ}.

Similarly, let's expand this. e^{-iθ} is cosθ - i sinθ. So:

(24 + 36i)(cosθ - i sinθ) = 24 cosθ - 24i sinθ + 36i cosθ - 36i² sinθ.

Again, i² is -1, so:

24 cosθ - 24i sinθ + 36i cosθ + 36 sinθ.

Separating real and imaginary:

Real part: 24 cosθ + 36 sinθ.

Imaginary part: -24 sinθ + 36 cosθ.

So, the real parts from both terms are:

First term: 300 cosθ - 468 sinθ.

Second term: 24 cosθ + 36 sinθ.

Adding these together, the total real part of the expression is:

(300 cosθ - 468 sinθ) + (24 cosθ + 36 sinθ) = (300 + 24) cosθ + (-468 + 36) sinθ.

Calculating the coefficients:

300 + 24 = 324.

-468 + 36 = -432.

So the real part is 324 cosθ - 432 sinθ.

Hmm, okay, so now we have a real expression in terms of θ: 324 cosθ - 432 sinθ. We need to find the maximum value of this expression as θ varies over [0, 2π).

This looks like a linear combination of sine and cosine, which can be rewritten as a single sine or cosine function with a phase shift. The maximum value of such an expression is the amplitude, which is the square root of the sum of the squares of the coefficients.

In general, for A cosθ + B sinθ, the maximum value is sqrt(A² + B²). So, let's compute that.

Here, A is 324 and B is -432. So,

Max = sqrt(324² + 432²).

Let me compute that.

First, compute 324 squared:

324 * 324:

Well, 300² is 90,000. 24² is 576. Then, 2*300*24 is 14,400.

So, (300 + 24)² = 300² + 2*300*24 + 24² = 90,000 + 14,400 + 576 = 104,976.

Similarly, 432 squared:

400² is 160,000. 32² is 1,024. Then, 2*400*32 is 25,600.

So, (400 + 32)² = 400² + 2*400*32 + 32² = 160,000 + 25,600 + 1,024 = 186,624.

Adding 104,976 and 186,624:

104,976 + 186,624 = 291,600.

So sqrt(291,600). Let's compute that.

Well, 500² is 250,000. 600² is 360,000. So it's somewhere between 500 and 600.

Compute 540²: 540 * 540.

500² = 250,000.

2*500*40 = 40,000.

40² = 1,600.

So, 540² = (500 + 40)² = 500² + 2*500*40 + 40² = 250,000 + 40,000 + 1,600 = 291,600.

Oh, exactly 540² is 291,600. So sqrt(291,600) is 540.

So, the maximum value of 324 cosθ - 432 sinθ is 540.

Therefore, the largest possible real part of the given expression is 540.

Wait, just to make sure I didn't make a mistake in the setup. Let me double-check.

We had the real part as 324 cosθ - 432 sinθ, correct? Yes, because when we expanded both terms, that's what we got. Then, the maximum of A cosθ + B sinθ is sqrt(A² + B²). That's a standard identity.

So the maximum is indeed 540. That seems right.

Just to recap:

1. Express z in polar form as 4e^{iθ}.
2. Express 1/z as (1/4)e^{-iθ}.
3. Substitute into the original expression.
4. Expand both terms and separate real and imaginary parts.
5. Sum the real parts to get 324 cosθ - 432 sinθ.
6. Recognize this as a sinusoidal function with amplitude sqrt(324² + 432²) = 540.
7. Therefore, the maximum real part is 540.

Yep, I think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in the calculations.


The problem requires finding the largest possible real part of the expression \((75 + 117i)z + \frac{96 + 144i}{z}\) where \(|z| = 4\). 

1. **Express \(z\) in polar form**: Let \(z = 4e^{i\theta}\). Then, \(1/z = \frac{1}{4}e^{-i\theta}\).

2. **Substitute \(z\) and \(1/z\) into the expression**:
   - The first term becomes \(4(75 + 117i)e^{i\theta}\).
   - The second term becomes \(\frac{96 + 144i}{4}e^{-i\theta} = (24 + 36i)e^{-i\theta}\).

3. **Expand and separate real and imaginary parts**:
   - For \(4(75 + 117i)e^{i\theta}\), the real part is \(300\cos\theta - 468\sin\theta\).
   - For \((24 + 36i)e^{-i\theta}\), the real part is \(24\cos\theta + 36\sin\theta\).

4. **Sum the real parts**:
   \[
   324\cos\theta - 432\sin\theta
   \]

5. **Find the maximum value**:
   - The expression \(324\cos\theta - 432\sin\theta\) can be written as \(A\cos\theta + B\sin\theta\), where \(A = 324\) and \(B = -432\).
   - The maximum value is \(\sqrt{A^2 + B^2} = \sqrt{324^2 + 432^2} = 540\).

Thus, the largest possible real part of the given expression is \(\boxed{540}\).
