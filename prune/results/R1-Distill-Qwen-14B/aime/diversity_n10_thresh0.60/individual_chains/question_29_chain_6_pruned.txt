Okay, so I've got this geometry problem here about two rectangles, ABCD and EFGH. The problem says that points D, E, C, F are collinear, which means they all lie on the same straight line. Also, points A, D, H, G all lie on a circle. The given lengths are BC=16, AB=107, FG=17, and EF=184. I need to find the length of CE.

Hmm, let me try to visualize this. There are two rectangles, so ABCD is one rectangle and EFGH is another. Since D, E, C, F are collinear, that line is going to pass through points D and C of the first rectangle and points E and F of the second rectangle.

Also, points A, D, H, G lie on a circle. That's interestingâ€”it means that these four points form a cyclic quadrilateral. I remember that in cyclic quadrilaterals, the opposite angles sum to 180 degrees, but I'm not sure if that's directly useful here. Maybe properties related to cyclic quadrilaterals could help, but let's see.

First, let me sketch the figure mentally. Rectangle ABCD has sides AB and BC. So AB is 107 units, BC is 16 units. That means the rectangle is longer along AB. So, if I imagine ABCD, it's a rectangle with length 107 and width 16. Let me assign coordinates to these points to make it easier.

Let me place point D at the origin (0,0). Then since ABCD is a rectangle, point C would be at (107,0) because BC is 16, but wait, BC is a vertical side. Wait, maybe I should reorient. Wait, in a rectangle, adjacent sides are perpendicular. So AB is one side, BC is another, meeting at B.

Wait, maybe assigning coordinates would help. Let me try that.

Let me place point D at (0,0). Then since ABCD is a rectangle, suppose AB is vertical and BC is horizontal. So, moving from D(0,0), moving up along the y-axis to C. Wait, no, because in a rectangle, adjacent sides are perpendicular. So maybe I need to define the rectangle more carefully.

Wait, perhaps it's better to assign coordinates systematically.

Let me assign point D at (0,0). Since ABCD is a rectangle, let me assume that AB is vertical and BC is horizontal. So, moving from D, moving up along the y-axis to point C. Wait, no, in a rectangle, the sides are AB, BC, CD, DA. So if D is at (0,0), then C could be at (a,0), then B would be at (a, b), and A at (0,b), where a and b are the lengths of the sides.

But in the problem, BC is given as 16, and AB is 107. So in rectangle ABCD, AB is one side, BC is another. So AB is 107 units, BC is 16 units. So if D is at (0,0), then since BC is 16, point C would be at (16,0). Wait, but then AB is 107, so from point B
