Okay, so Alice and Bob are playing a game with a stack of n tokens. They take turns removing either 1 or 4 tokens. Alice goes first. The person who takes the last token wins. I need to find how many positive integers n â‰¤ 2024 allow Bob to have a winning strategy, no matter how Alice plays.

Hmm. This sounds like a combinatorial game theory problem. I remember that these types of games can often be analyzed using the concept of winning and losing positions. A winning position is one where the current player can force a win, and a losing position is one where no matter what the current player does, the opponent can force a win.

So, in this game, the players can remove 1 or 4 tokens on their turn. The goal is to take the last token. So, if a player is faced with 1 token, they can take it and win. Similarly, if a player is faced with 4 tokens, they can take all 4 and win. But for other numbers, it depends on the moves.

I think I should model this using dynamic programming. I can represent each position n as either a winning (W) or losing (L) position. The base cases are when n=0, which is a losing position because the player can't move. Wait, but in this game, taking the last token wins, so n=0 would mean the game is over. So, positions where n=1 or n=4 are winning positions because the player can take all and win.

Wait, let me clarify:

- If n = 0: game is over, so it's a losing position because the player can't do anything. So, if it's your turn and there are 0 tokens, you lose.

- If n = 1: you can take 1 token and win. So, W.

- If n = 4: you can take 4 tokens and win. So, W.

For other values of n, the position is a winning position if the player can move to a losing position for the opponent. So, if from n, you can remove 1 or 4 tokens and reach a position that's a losing position for the opponent, then n is a winning position. Otherwise, it's a losing position.

Let me try to build this step by step.

Start with n=0: L

n=1: W
