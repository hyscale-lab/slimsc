Okay, so I've come across this geometry problem, and I want to figure it out step by step. Let me try to understand what the problem is saying and how to approach it.

The problem is about a convex equilateral hexagon named ABCDEF. It mentions that all pairs of opposite sides are parallel. So, AB is parallel to DE, BC is parallel to EF, and CD is parallel to FA. Also, it's equilateral, which I think means all its sides are equal in length. So, each side AB, BC, CD, DE, EF, and FA has the same length, let's call it 's'. But the problem is asking for the side length, so I need to find 's'.

Then, the problem states that the triangle formed by extending the sides AB, CD, and EF has side lengths 200, 240, and 300. Hmm, okay. So, if I extend AB, CD, and EF, these extended lines will form a triangle, and the lengths of the sides of this triangle are given. I need to figure out how this triangle relates to the hexagon and find the side length 's'.

Let me visualize this. A convex equilateral hexagon with opposite sides parallel. Since it's convex, all internal angles are less than 180 degrees. Also, since opposite sides are parallel, the hexagon is similar in some way to a regular hexagon but not necessarily with equal angles. But all sides are equal because it's equilateral.

I remember that in such a hexagon, the sides can be thought of as vectors in a plane, each with the same magnitude but different directions. Since opposite sides are parallel, their direction vectors are the same, but pointing in opposite directions.

Wait, maybe it's better to model this hexagon using vectors or coordinate geometry. Let me think about that.

Alternatively, perhaps I can consider the hexagon as being formed by combining three parallelograms. Since each pair of opposite sides is parallel and equal in length, the hexagon can be constructed by adding three parallelograms together. But I'm not entirely sure about that.

The triangle formed by extending AB, CD, and EF. Let me think about how that triangle is formed. If I extend AB, CD, and EF, these are three non-consecutive sides of the hexagon. Since the hexagon is convex, these extensions will meet each other to form a triangle outside the hexagon.

So, the triangle is formed by the extensions of AB, CD, and EF. Let me denote this triangle as triangle XYZ, where X, Y, Z are the points where these extensions meet.

The sides of this triangle are 200, 240, and 300. So, the lengths XY = 200, YZ = 240, and ZX = 300, or some permutation of these. Wait, actually, the problem doesn't specify the order, so I might have to consider how these sides correspond.

But maybe I can consider the triangle formed by the extensions as a larger triangle, and the hexagon is somehow inscribed within it or related to it.

Since all sides of the hexagon are equal and opposite sides are parallel, the hexagon is a special kind of equilateral hexagon. I've heard of such hexagons being called "aff
