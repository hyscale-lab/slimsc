Okay, so I'm trying to solve this problem about the residents of Aimeville and the things they own. Let me read the problem again to make sure I understand all the details.

There are 900 residents in total. Some own a diamond ring, some own a set of golf clubs, some own a garden spade, and all of them own a bag of candy hearts. So, candy hearts are universal—everyone has those. The numbers given are: 195 own a diamond ring, 367 own golf clubs, 562 own a garden spade, and 437 own exactly two of these things. Also, 234 own exactly three of them. The question is, how many own all four items?

Hmm, okay. So, we're dealing with sets and their intersections. Since the problem involves multiple overlapping groups, I think using the principle of inclusion-exclusion would be the way to go here. But I'm a bit fuzzy on exactly how that works when dealing with four sets. Let me recall.

The inclusion-exclusion principle for four sets says that the total number of elements in the union of four sets is equal to the sum of the sizes of each set, minus the sum of all pairwise intersections, plus the sum of all triple-wise intersections, minus the four-way intersection. The formula looks like this:

|A ∪ B ∪ C ∪ D| = |A| + |B| + |C| + |D| - |A∩B| - |A∩C| - |A∩D| - |B∩C| - |B∩D| - |C∩D| + |A∩B∩C| + |A∩B∩D| + |A∩C∩D| + |B∩C∩D| - |A∩B∩C∩D|

But wait, in this problem, everyone owns at least a bag of candy hearts, so D is the set of all 900 residents. So, |D| = 900. But since all four items are being considered, and everyone owns the candy hearts, that might simplify things a bit.

Wait, actually, the problem says each of the 900 residents owns a bag of candy hearts. So, the candy hearts are owned by everyone. So, the total number of residents is equal to the number of people who own all four items, plus those who own exactly three, exactly two, exactly one, or exactly four. But since everyone owns at least the candy hearts, no one owns zero items. So, the total is accounted for by the people owning exactly one, two, three, or four items.

Wait, but the problem gives us the number of people who own exactly two and exactly three things. So, let's note that:

Number of people with exactly two items: 437

Number of people with exactly three items: 234

We need to find the number with all four, which I'll call x.

Additionally, we can find the number of people who own exactly one item, maybe. Because the total is 900.

Let me think. The total number is the sum of people owning exactly one, exactly two, exactly three, and exactly four items.

So, total = exactly_one + exactly_two + exactly
