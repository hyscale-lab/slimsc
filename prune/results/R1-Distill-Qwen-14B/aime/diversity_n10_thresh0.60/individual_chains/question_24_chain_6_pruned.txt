Okay, so I have this math problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again.

"A list of positive integers has the following properties:

1. The sum of the items in the list is 30.
2. The unique mode of the list is 9.
3. The median of the list is a positive integer that does not appear in the list itself.

Find the sum of the squares of all the items in the list."

Hmm, okay. So I need to construct a list of positive integers that satisfies these three conditions, and then compute the sum of their squares.

Let me break down each condition and see what they tell me.

First, the sum is 30. That's straightforward—whatever numbers are in the list add up to 30.

Second, the unique mode is 9. Mode means the number that appears most frequently, and it's unique, so 9 must appear more times than any other number in the list. So 9 has to be the most frequent.

Third, the median is a positive integer that doesn't appear in the list. The median is the middle number when the list is ordered. If the list has an odd number of elements, the median is the middle one. If it's even, it's the average of the two middle numbers. But here, the median is a positive integer not in the list. So this suggests that when the list is ordered, the average of the two middle numbers is an integer not present in the actual list.

Wait, but the median has to be a positive integer. So, if the list has an even number of elements, the median would be the average of the two middle numbers. For that average to be an integer, the two middle numbers must be either both even or both odd. Also, that average must not be present in the list.

Let me think about how to approach this.

I think I need to figure out the possible lengths of the list. Let's denote the list as L, and n as the number of elements in L. So n can be any positive integer, but given that the sum is 30, n can't be too large.

Let me consider possible values of n. Since all elements are positive integers, the minimum possible sum for n elements is n (if each is 1). So n must be ≤30. But more practically, considering that the mode is 9, which is a relatively large number, n can't be too small either. Let's think about possible n.

Wait, let's think about the mode first. The mode is 9, and it's unique. So 9 must appear more times than any other number. Let's say 9 appears k times. Then, any other number can appear at most k-1 times.

Now, the sum of all elements is 30. So 9k + sum of other elements =30.

The other elements can't be 9 because we're considering the unique mode.

So, let's think about possible values of k.

If k is 1, then 9 appears once. But then, the other numbers can also appear once, so there's no unique mode. So k must be at least 2.

If k is 2, then 9 appears twice. Then other numbers can appear at
