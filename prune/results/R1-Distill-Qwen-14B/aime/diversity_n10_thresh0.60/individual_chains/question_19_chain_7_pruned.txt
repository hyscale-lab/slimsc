Okay, so I've got this geometry problem here. Let me read it again. It's about triangle ABC with circumcenter O and incenter I. The condition given is that IA is perpendicular to OI. The circumradius is 13, and the inradius is 6. We need to find AB multiplied by AC.

Alright, let's break this down. I remember that the circumradius R is related to the sides of the triangle, and the inradius r is related to the area and semiperimeter. Maybe I can use some formulas involving these.

First, let's recall some properties. The circumradius R is given by the formula R = (a*b*c)/(4*Δ), where a, b, c are the sides of the triangle and Δ is the area. The inradius r is given by r = Δ/s, where s is the semiperimeter, s = (a + b + c)/2.

In this problem, R is 13 and r is 6. So, Δ = r * s = 6s. Also, from the circumradius formula, Δ = (a*b*c)/(4*13) = (a*b*c)/52. So, setting these equal: 6s = (a*b*c)/52. That gives a*b*c = 312s. Hmm, not sure if that's immediately useful, but I'll keep it in mind.

Now, the condition that IA is perpendicular to OI. IA is the inradius segment from I to A, and OI is the segment from the circumcenter O to the incenter I. I remember there's a formula that relates the distance between O and I, which is OI² = R(R - 2r). Wait, let me confirm that. Oh yes, the formula is OI² = R² - 2Rr. Let me plug in the values: OI² = 13² - 2*13*6 = 169 - 156 = 13. So OI is sqrt(13). Interesting.

But how does that help with IA being perpendicular to OI? Hmm. Since IA is perpendicular to OI, the vectors IA and OI are perpendicular, so their dot product is zero. Maybe coordinate geometry can help here. Let me try setting up a coordinate system.

Let's place point I at the origin (0,0) for simplicity. Then, since IA is perpendicular to OI, which is the vector from I to O. Let me denote O as (h, k). Then, vector OI is (h, k), and vector IA is the vector from I to A, which is (x, y) if A is at (x, y). Since IA is perpendicular to OI, their dot product should be zero: h*x + k*y = 0.

But wait, since I is at (0,0), and O is at (h, k), the distance between O and I is sqrt(h² + k²) = sqrt(13). So h² + k² = 13.

Also, the circumradius is 13, so the distance from O to each vertex is 13. So OA = OB = OC = 13. So, point A lies on the circle centered at O with radius 13
