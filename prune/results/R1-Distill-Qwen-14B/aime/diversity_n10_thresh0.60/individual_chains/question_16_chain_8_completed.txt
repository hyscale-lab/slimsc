Okay, so I have this math problem to solve. Let me read it again and make sure I understand what’s being asked.

The problem says: Let p be the least prime number for which there exists a positive integer n such that n⁴ + 1 is divisible by p². Then, I need to find the least positive integer m such that m⁴ + 1 is divisible by p².

Hmm, okay. So first, I need to find the smallest prime p where p² divides some n⁴ + 1 for a positive integer n. Once I have that p, I need to find the smallest m where m⁴ + 1 is divisible by p².

Let me think about primes and their properties. I remember that primes are numbers greater than 1 that have no positive divisors other than 1 and themselves. The primes start from 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, etc.

I also recall that for a prime p, if p divides n⁴ + 1, then n⁸ ≡ 1 mod p. So the order of n modulo p divides 8. But since n⁴ ≡ -1 mod p, the order can't be 4 because (-1)^2 = 1, so the order is 8. Therefore, 8 must divide p-1 because the multiplicative order of an element modulo p divides p-1 (by Fermat's little theorem). So p ≡ 1 mod 8.

Wait, but that's when p divides n⁴ + 1. But in this problem, p² divides n⁴ + 1. So maybe we need a prime p where n⁴ ≡ -1 mod p², not just mod p. So perhaps the conditions are more stringent.

Let me consider small primes and see if p² divides n⁴ + 1 for some n.

Starting with the smallest primes:

p=2: Let's see. n⁴ + 1 mod 4. For n=1: 1 +1=2, which is 2 mod 4, not divisible by 4. n=2: 16 +1=17, which is 1 mod 4. n=3: 81 +1=82, which is 2 mod 4. So 2²=4 doesn't divide any n⁴ +1. So p=2 is not suitable.

p=3: Check if 9 divides n⁴ +1 for some n.

Compute n⁴ +1 mod 9 for n=1: 1+1=2 mod9. n=2: 16+1=17 mod9=8. n=3: 81+1=82 mod9= 82-9*9=82-81=1. n=4: 256 +1=257 mod9. Let me compute 256 mod9: 2+5+6=13, 1+3=4. So 4+1=5 mod9. n=5: 625 +1=626. 625 mod9: 6+2+5=13→4, so 4+1=5 mod9. Hmm.

Wait, maybe a better approach is to compute n⁴ mod9 for n from 0 to 8, since mod9.

n : n⁴ mod9

0: 0⁴=0

1:1

2:16=7

3:81=0

4:256. 256/9=28*9=252, 256-252=4 →4

5:625. 625-69*9=625-621=4 →4

6:6⁴=1296→0

7:7⁴=49²=2401→2401 mod9. Sum digits:2+4+0+1=7 →7 mod9.

8:8⁴=4096. 4096 mod9: 4+0+9+6=19→10→1 →1 mod9.

So n⁴ mod9 can be 0,1,4,7.

So n⁴ +1 mod9 would be 1,2,5,8. None of these are 0. So 9 doesn't divide n⁴ +1 for any n. So p=3 is not suitable.

Next prime p=5.

Check if 25 divides n⁴ +1 for some n.

Compute n⁴ mod25. Let me compute n from 0 to 24, but perhaps it's faster to compute for n from 1 to 24 and see if any n⁴ ≡ -1 mod25.

Alternatively, compute n⁴ mod25 and see if any is 24 (since -1 mod25=24).

Compute n⁴ mod25 for n=1 to 12 (since beyond that it repeats due to symmetry).

n=1: 1

n=2:16

n=3:81 mod25=6

n=4:256 mod25. 256-10*25=256-250=6

n=5:0

n=6:6⁴=1296. 1296 mod25. 25*51=1275, 1296-1275=21

n=7:7⁴=49²=2401. 2401 mod25: 2400 is 96*25, so 2401 mod25=1

n=8:8⁴=4096. 4096 mod25: 4096 - 163*25=4096-4075=21

n=9:9⁴=6561. 6561 mod25: 6560 is 262*25, so 6561 mod25=1

n=10:10⁴=10000 mod25=0

n=11:11⁴=14641. 14641 mod25: 14640 is 585*25, so 14641 mod25=1

n=12:12⁴=20736. 20736 mod25: 20736 - 829*25=20736-20725=11.

Wait, so up to n=12, the n⁴ mod25 values are:

1, 16, 6, 6, 0,21,1,21,1,0,1,11.

Not seeing a 24. Let me check n=13, which is equivalent to -12 mod25. Let's compute n=13: (-12)⁴=12⁴= same as n=12, which is 11 mod25.

Similarly, n=14: (-11)⁴=11⁴=1 mod25.

n=15: (-10)⁴=10⁴=0.

n=16: (-9)⁴=9⁴=1.

n=17: (-8)^4=8^4=21.

n=18: (-7)^4=7^4=1.

n=19: (-6)^4=6^4=21.

n=20: (-5)^4=5^4=0.

n=21: (-4)^4=4^4=6.

n=22: (-3)^4=3^4=6.

n=23: (-2)^4=2^4=16.

n=24: (-1)^4=1.

So n⁴ mod25 is either 0,1,6,11,16,21, or 24? Wait, in the calculations above, I never got 24. So does there exist an n such that n⁴ ≡24 mod25?

Wait, maybe I made a mistake. Let me check n=7: 7⁴=49²=2401. 2401 mod25 is 2401 - 96*25=2401-2400=1. So 1. Hmm.

Wait, n=2: 16. 16 mod25 is 16, which is not -1.

n=3: 81 mod25=6, which isn't 24.

n=4: 256 mod25=6.

n=7:1.

n=8:21.

n=12:11.

n=13:11.

n=17:1.

n=18:1.

n=19:21.

n=22:6.

n=23:16.

n=24:1.

Wait, so none of these are 24, which is -1 mod25. So for p=5, 25 does not divide any n⁴ +1. Therefore, p=5 is not suitable.

Next prime p=7.

Check if 49 divides n⁴ +1 for some n.

Compute n⁴ mod49.

This might get tedious, but perhaps I can find if there's an n where n⁴ ≡-1 mod49.

Alternatively, maybe I can use some theorems or properties.

I remember that if p is a prime, and if -1 is a quartic residue modulo p², then certain conditions must hold.

But maybe for p=7, let's see.

First, check if -1 is a quartic residue modulo 7.

Wait, modulo 7, the multiplicative group is of order 6. So the possible orders of elements divide 6.

We want to find if there's an x with x⁴ ≡ -1 mod7.

Compute x⁴ mod7 for x=1 to 6:

x=1:1

x=2:16 mod7=2

x=3:81 mod7= 81-11*7=81-77=4

x=4:256 mod7. 256 /7: 7*36=252, so 256-252=4. So 4 mod7.

x=5:625 mod7. 7*89=623, 625-623=2.

x=6:1296 mod7. 7*185=1295, so 1296 mod7=1.

So x⁴ mod7: 1,2,4,4,2,1.

So looking for -1 mod7 is 6. So none of these are 6. So -1 is not a quartic residue mod7. So even mod7, there's no solution, let alone mod49. Therefore, p=7 is not suitable.

Wait, but maybe that's not the case. Because sometimes higher powers can have solutions even if the base doesn't. Hmm, I might need to think more carefully.

Wait, another approach: For p=7, if we can find an n such that n⁴ ≡-1 mod7²=49.

So let's compute n⁴ mod49 for n=1 to 48, but that's a lot. Maybe we can find a pattern.

Alternatively, perhaps using Hensel's lemma. If n ≡ a mod7 and a⁴ ≡-1 mod7, then we can lift the solution to mod49.

But wait, in mod7, we saw that x⁴ mod7 can't be 6, which is -1 mod7. So there is no a with a⁴ ≡-1 mod7. Therefore, even if we try to lift, there's no solution. So p=7 is out.

Next prime p=11.

Wait, but wait, perhaps I should check p=13, or wait, what about p=17?

Wait, but maybe it's better to think in terms of primes where -1 is a quartic residue mod p.

So from earlier, for p=2, 3,5,7, there's no solution. Let me check p=13.

Wait, p=13: Let's see if -1 is a quartic residue mod13.

We can compute x⁴ mod13 for x=1 to 12.

x=1:1

x=2:16 mod13=3

x=3:81 mod13=81-6*13=81-78=3

x=4:256 mod13. 13*19=247, 256-247=9.

x=5:625 mod13. 13*48=624, 625-624=1.

x=6: 6⁴=1296 mod13. 13*99=1287, 1296-1287=9.

x=7:7⁴=49²=2401 mod13. 13*184=2392, 2401-2392=9.

x=8:8⁴=4096 mod13. 13*315=4095, so 4096 mod13=1.

x=9:9⁴=(9²)²=81²=6561 mod13. 6561 mod13: Let's compute 13*504=6552, so 6561-6552=9.

x=10:10⁴=10000 mod13. 13*769=9997, 10000-9997=3.

x=11:11⁴=14641 mod13. 13*1126=14638, 14641-14638=3.

x=12:12⁴=20736 mod13. Let me compute 20736 ÷13.

13*1595=20735, so 20736 mod13=1.

So the quartic residues mod13 are 1,3,9.

Looking for -1 mod13, which is 12. So 12 is not among the quartic residues. So p=13 can't have n⁴ ≡-1 mod13, let alone mod169.

So p=13 is out.

Next prime p=17.

Check if -1 is a quartic residue mod17.

Compute x⁴ mod17 for x=1 to 16.

x=1:1

x=2:16 mod17=16

x=3:81 mod17=81-4*17=81-68=13

x=4:256 mod17. 17*15=255, so 256 mod17=1.

x=5:625 mod17. 17*36=612, 625-612=13.

x=6:1296 mod17. 17*76=1292, 1296-1292=4.

x=7:49²=2401. 2401 mod17. Let's compute 17*141=2397, 2401-2397=4.

x=8:8⁴=4096 mod17. 17*241=4097, so 4096 mod17= -1 mod17=16.

Wait, 4096 mod17=16.

x=9:9⁴=6561 mod17. Let's compute 6561 ÷17: 17*385=6545, 6561-6545=16.

x=10:10⁴=10000 mod17. 17*588=10000-17*588=10000-10000=0? Wait, 17*588=10000- let me check: 17*500=8500, 17*88=1496; 8500+1496=9996. So 10000-9996=4. So 4 mod17.

x=11:11⁴=14641 mod17. 14641 ÷17: 17*861=14637, 14641-14637=4.

x=12:12⁴=20736 mod17. 17*1219=20723, 20736-20723=13.

x=13:13⁴=28561 mod17. 17*1680=28560, so 28561 mod17=1.

x=14:14⁴=38416 mod17. 17*2260=38420, so 38416 mod17= -4 mod17=13.

x=15:15⁴=50625 mod17. 50625 ÷17: 17*2978=50626, so 50625 mod17= -1 mod17=16.

x=16:16⁴=65536 mod17. 65536 ÷17: 17*3855=65535, so 65536 mod17=1.

So the quartic residues mod17 are 1,4,13,16.

Looking for -1 mod17, which is 16. Oh, wait, 16 is a quartic residue, as x=8 and x=9 give 16.

So, for p=17, there exists n such that n⁴ ≡ -1 mod17. Now, can we lift this to mod17²=289?

That is, can we find an n such that n⁴ ≡ -1 mod289?

If so, then p=17 would be the least prime we're looking for.

Wait, but before that, are there any smaller primes than 17 where -1 is a quartic residue mod p?

Wait, the primes I checked before p=17 were 2,3,5,7,11,13, and none of them had -1 as a quartic residue. So p=17 is the least such prime.

So p=17 is the least prime where p² divides n⁴ +1 for some n.

Now, the next part is to find the least positive integer m such that m⁴ +1 is divisible by p²=289.

So, m⁴ ≡ -1 mod289.

We need to find the smallest m where this holds.

Now, from earlier, in mod17, we saw that n=8 and n=9 satisfy n⁴ ≡16 ≡-1 mod17.

So, perhaps we can use Hensel's lemma to lift these solutions modulo17 to modulo17²=289.

Hensel's lemma says that if f(n) ≡0 mod p and f’(n) not ≡0 mod p, then there exists a unique lift modulo p².

Here, f(n)=n⁴ +1. So f’(n)=4n³.

So, for n≡8 mod17, we have f(n)=8⁴ +1=4096 +1=4097. 4097 mod17: 4097 ÷17=241, since 17*241=4097. So 4097 mod17=0, as expected.

Now, compute f’(8)=4*(8)³=4*512=2048. 2048 mod17: Let's compute 17*120=2040, so 2048 mod17=2048-2040=8. Since 8≠0 mod17, the derivative is non-zero, so Hensel's lemma applies, and there's a unique lift modulo17².

So, let’s find m ≡8 mod17, such that m⁴ ≡-1 mod289.

Let me write m=8 +17k, where k is an integer to be determined.

Compute m⁴ +1 mod289.

First, compute m=8+17k.

Compute m mod17: 8 mod17, which is correct.

Compute m⁴ mod289.

Let me compute (8 +17k)^4.

Expanding using the binomial theorem:

=8⁴ + 4*8³*(17k) + 6*8²*(17k)^2 + 4*8*(17k)^3 + (17k)^4.

But since we're working mod289=17², any term with 17² or higher power will be 0 mod289.

So, only the first two terms matter:

=8⁴ + 4*8³*17k mod289.

Compute each part:

8⁴=4096.

4096 mod289: Let's compute how many times 289 goes into 4096.

289*14=4046. 4096 -4046=50. So 8⁴ mod289=50.

4*8³=4*512=2048.

2048 *17k = (2048 mod289)*17k.

Compute 2048 mod289:

289*7=2023. 2048-2023=25. So 2048 mod289=25.

So 25*17k=425k mod289.

But 425 mod289: 425 -289=136.

So 425k mod289=136k.

Putting it together:

m⁴ ≡50 +136k mod289.

We need m⁴ ≡-1 mod289. Since -1 mod289=288.

So 50 +136k ≡288 mod289.

Subtract 50: 136k ≡238 mod289.

Now, solve for k: 136k ≡238 mod289.

First, check if 136 and 289 are coprime. 289=17², and 136=8*17. So gcd(136,289)=17. So 17 divides both 136 and 289.

So, for the equation 136k ≡238 mod289 to have a solution, 17 must divide 238.

Check: 238 ÷17=14. So yes, 17*14=238.

So, the equation reduces to (136/17)k ≡ (238/17) mod (289/17).

Which is 8k ≡14 mod17.

So 8k ≡14 mod17.

Multiply both sides by the inverse of 8 mod17.

Find the inverse of 8 mod17. 8*2=16≡-1, so 8*15=120≡120-7*17=120-119=1 mod17. So inverse is 15.

So k ≡14*15 mod17.

14*15=210. 210 mod17: 17*12=204, 210-204=6.

So k≡6 mod17.

So the solution is k=6 +17t, for integer t.

Thus, m=8 +17k=8 +17*(6 +17t)=8 +102 +289t=110 +289t.

So the minimal positive m is 110.

Wait, wait, but wait, let's check m=110.

Compute 110⁴ +1 mod289.

But that might be time-consuming. Alternatively, let's check my steps.

Wait, I found m=8 +17k, where k=6 mod17, so k=6. So m=8 +17*6=8+102=110.

Let me compute 110 mod17: 17*6=102, 110-102=8. So m≡8 mod17, which is correct.

Compute m⁴ mod289. From earlier steps, we had m⁴ ≡50 +136k mod289.

k=6, so 50 +136*6=50 +816=866.

866 mod289: 289*3=867, so 866=867-1 →866 mod289= -1 mod289=288.

Which is exactly what we wanted: m⁴ +1 ≡0 mod289.

So m=110 is a solution.

But wait, is 110 the minimal positive integer? Let me check if a smaller m exists. For example, perhaps m=110 -289= -179, but that's negative, so 110 is the smallest positive.

Wait, but let me check m=110 -17* something to get a smaller positive. 110-17*6=110-102=8. Wait, 8⁴ +1=4096 +1=4097, which is 17*241=4097, so 4097 mod289=50, as we saw earlier. So 50≠0 mod289. So 8 is not a solution mod289, only mod17.

So 110 is the minimal positive solution.

Wait, but is there another solution with m less than 110? Let's think.

Another solution comes from the other root mod17. Earlier, I took n=8 mod17, but also n=9 mod17. Let me check if that gives a smaller m.

So let's take n=9 mod17. Let me apply Hensel's lemma to n=9.

So, m=9 +17k.

Compute f(m)=m⁴ +1 mod289.

Again, f(m)= (9 +17k)^4 +1.

Expand using binomial up to second order:

=9⁴ +4*9³*17k mod289.

Compute each term:

9⁴=6561.

6561 ÷289: 289*22=6358, 6561-6358=203. So 9⁴ mod289=203.

4*9³=4*729=2916.

2916*17k mod289.

First, compute 2916 mod289.

289*10=2890. 2916-2890=26. So 2916 mod289=26.

So 26*17k=442k mod289.

Compute 442 mod289:442 -289=153.

So 442k mod289=153k.

Putting it together:

m⁴ ≡203 +153k mod289.

We need 203 +153k ≡288 mod289 (since -1 mod289=288).

So 153k ≡85 mod289.

Again, check gcd(153,289). 153=9*17, 289=17². So gcd=17.

Check if 17 divides 85: yes, 85=5*17.

So, divide equation by 17: (153/17)k ≡85/17 mod289/17.

Which gives 9k ≡5 mod17.

Solve 9k ≡5 mod17.

Find the inverse of 9 mod17. 9*2=18≡1 mod17. So inverse is 2.

So k≡5*2=10 mod17.

Thus, k=10 +17t.

So m=9 +17k=9 +17*10=9+170=179.

Wait, 179 is bigger than 110, so 110 is still the minimal solution.

So, the least positive integer m is 110.


The least prime \( p \) for which \( p^2 \) divides \( n^4 + 1 \) for some positive integer \( n \) is \( p = 17 \). Using Hensel's lemma, the smallest positive integer \( m \) satisfying \( m^4 + 1 \equiv 0 \mod{17^2} \) is \( m = 110 \).

**Answer:** The least positive integer \( m \) is \(\boxed{110}\).
