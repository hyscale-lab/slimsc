Okay, so I need to solve this probability problem about Jen entering a lottery. Let me try to understand the problem step by step.

Jen picks 4 distinct numbers from the set S = {1,2,3,...,10}. Then, 4 numbers are randomly chosen from S. She wins a prize if at least two of her numbers match two of the randomly chosen numbers. She wins the grand prize if all four of her numbers match the four chosen. The question is about finding the probability that she wins the grand prize given that she won a prize. They want this probability expressed as a reduced fraction m/n, and then we need to find m + n.

Hmm, okay. So this is a conditional probability problem. The formula for conditional probability is P(A|B) = P(A ∩ B) / P(B). In this case, event A is winning the grand prize, and event B is winning a prize. So I need to find the probability that she wins the grand prize given that she won a prize.

First, let's define the sample space. Both Jen and the lottery are picking 4 distinct numbers from 10. So the total number of possible ways to choose 4 numbers from 10 is C(10,4), which is 210. So the total number of possible lottery results is 210.

Now, let's think about event B: she wins a prize. This means that at least two of her numbers are chosen in the lottery. So the number of ways she can have exactly 2, 3, or 4 matching numbers with the lottery. 

Wait, but actually, the event B includes all cases where she has 2, 3, or 4 matches. So we need to calculate the number of such cases.

Alternatively, maybe it's easier to calculate the probability of not winning a prize and subtract from 1. But since we need the count for B, perhaps it's better to calculate it directly.

So let me denote:

- Let J be Jen's set of 4 numbers.
- The lottery picks a set L of 4 numbers.

We need to compute how many possible L's have at least 2 numbers in common with J.

The number of L's that have exactly k numbers in common with J is C(4,k) * C(6,4−k). Because we choose k numbers from J and the remaining 4−k from the other 6 numbers not in J.

So for k=2,3,4:

- For k=2: C(4,2)*C(6,2) = 6 * 15 = 90
- For k=3: C(4,3)*C(6,1) = 4 * 6 = 24
- For k=4: C(4,4)*C(6,0) = 1 * 1 = 1

So the total number of L's where at least 2 numbers match is 90 + 24 + 1 = 115.

Wait, let me double-check that: 90 + 24 is 114, plus 1 is 115. So yes, 115
