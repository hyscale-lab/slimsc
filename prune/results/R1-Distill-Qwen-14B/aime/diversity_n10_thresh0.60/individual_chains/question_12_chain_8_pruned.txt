Okay, let's tackle this problem. So, we have a 2x3 grid, meaning 2 rows and 3 columns. Each cell will have a digit from 0 to 9. The goal is to find the number of ways to fill this grid such that two conditions are satisfied:

1. The sum of the two numbers formed by reading left to right is 999.
2. The sum of the three numbers formed by reading top to bottom is 99.

Hmm, let me visualize the grid. Let's label the cells as follows:

\[
\begin{array}{|c|c|c|}
\hline
a & b & c \\
\hline
d & e & f \\
\hline
\end{array}
\]

So, the first number formed by reading left to right in the top row is the three-digit number abc. The second number is def. Their sum should be 999.

Similarly, for the vertical reading, each column forms a two-digit number: ad, be, and cf. Their sum should be 99.

Alright, let's break down the horizontal condition first. The sum of abc and def is 999. Since abc and def are both three-digit numbers, their sum is 999. That means abc + def = 999.

Let me note that abc is 100a + 10b + c, and def is 100d + 10e + f. So,

100a +10b + c + 100d +10e + f = 999.

Similarly, for the vertical condition, the sum of ad, be, and cf is 99. Each of these is a two-digit number: ad is 10a + d, be is 10b + e, and cf is 10c + f. So,

(10a + d) + (10b + e) + (10c + f) = 99.

Let me write both equations:

1) 100a +10b + c + 100d +10e + f = 999.

2) 10a + d + 10b + e + 10c + f = 99.

Hmm, maybe I can subtract equation 2 from equation 1 to see if that simplifies things.

Equation 1: 100a +10b + c + 100d +10e + f = 999.

Equation 2: 10a + d + 10b + e + 10c + f = 99.

Subtracting equation 2 from equation 1:

(100a -10a) + (10b -10b) + (c -10c) + (100d -d) + (10e -e) + (f -f) = 999 -99.

Calculating each term:

90a + 0b -9c + 99d +9e +0f = 900.

Simplify:

90a -9c +99d +9e = 900.

Divide both sides by 9 to make it simpler:

10a - c +11d + e = 100.

So, we have:

10a - c +11d + e = 100.  ... Let's call this equation 3.

Now, equation 2 is:

10a + d +10b + e +10c + f =99.

Wait, perhaps I can express f from equation 2. Let me try that.

From equation 2:

f = 99 - (10a + d +10b + e +10c).

Hmm, so f = 99 -10a -d -10b -e -10c.

But f is a digit, so it must be between 0 and 9. So, the expression 99 -10a -d -10b -e -10c must be between 0 and 9.

But I'm not sure if that's helpful yet. Maybe I can find another way.

Looking back at equation 3: 10a -c +11d + e =100.

Let me rearrange this as:

10a +11d + e -c =100.

Hmm, perhaps I can express e in terms of other variables.

e = 100 -10a -11d +c.

But e is a digit, so 0 ≤ e ≤9.

So,

0 ≤ 100 -10a -11d +c ≤9.

Which can be rewritten as:

10a +11d -c ≤100,

and

10a +11d -c ≥91.

Because:

100 -10a -11d +c ≥0 ⇒ 10a +11d -c ≤100.

And,

100 -10a -11d +c ≤9 ⇒ 10a +11d -c ≥91.

So,

91 ≤10a +11d -c ≤100.

Hmm, that's a useful inequality.

Also, since a, d, c are digits (0-9), let's see possible values for a and d, because 10a and 11d are the main terms here.

Let's think about the possible values of a and d.

a can be 0-9, but since abc is a three-digit number, 'a' cannot be 0. Wait, no, in the problem statement, it's not stated that the numbers can't have leading zeros. Wait, the example given in the problem has a top row starting with 0, so I think leading zeros are allowed.

So, a can be 0-9. Similarly, d can be 0-9.

But let's think about 10a +11d -c.

Since c is a digit (0-9), 10a +11d must be between 91 +c and 100 +c. So, since c can be up to 9, 10a +11d must be at least 91 and at most 109.

Wait, but 10a +11d can be as low as 0 (if a=0, d=0) and as high as 10*9 +11*9 = 90 +99=189. But in our case, from equation 3, 10a +11d -c is between 91 and 100.

So, 10a +11d is between 91 +0=91 and 100 +9=109.

So, 91 ≤10a +11d ≤109.

So, 10a +11d must be between 91 and 1
