Okay, so I came across this math problem about coloring the vertices of a regular octagon. Each vertex can be colored either red or blue, each with a 50% chance. The question is asking for the probability that after coloring, there's a rotation of the octagon such that all the blue vertices end up where the red ones were originally. The answer needs to be in the form of a fraction m/n, where m and n are coprime, and then find m + n.

Hmm, let me try to break this down. First, I know that a regular octagon has 8 sides, so it has 8 vertices. Each vertex is being colored either red or blue independently with a 50% chance for each color. So, the total number of possible colorings is 2^8, which is 256. That's straightforward.

Now, the problem is about the probability that after some rotation, all the blue vertices move to where red ones were. So, we're looking for colorings where there's a rotation that maps blue vertices to the original red positions. 

Wait, but the octagon is being rotated, so the idea is that the set of blue vertices, when rotated, coincides with the set of red vertices. So, for a given coloring, if we can rotate the octagon such that every blue vertex moves to a position that was originally red, then that coloring satisfies the condition.

But how do we calculate the number of such colorings? Maybe I should think about group theory, specifically Burnside's lemma or something related to group actions. But I'm not too familiar with Burnside's lemma, so maybe I can approach this more directly.

Let me think about the rotations of an octagon. The octagon has rotational symmetry of order 8, meaning it can be rotated by 0°, 45°, 90°, ..., up to 315°, corresponding to rotations by 0, 1, 2, ..., 7 steps (since each step is 45°). Each rotation can be considered as a permutation of the vertices.

So, for each rotation, we can check if the permutation of the vertices (i.e., where each vertex moves) maps the blue vertices to the red ones. But since the coloring is fixed, perhaps we need to find colorings where the blue set is a rotation of the red set.

Wait, but the red and blue sets are complementary. So, if the blue set is a rotation of the red set, that would mean that the entire coloring is symmetric under some rotation. Because if you rotate the octagon such that blue becomes red, then the red set must be a rotation of the blue set. So, the colorings we're interested in are those that are fixed by some non-zero rotation.

Wait, no, not exactly fixed, but such that blue is a rotation image of red. Since red is the complement of blue, the coloring must be such that the blue set is a rotation of the red set.

Alternatively, the coloring is symmetric under a rotation that maps blue to red. So, for a coloring to satisfy the condition, there must exist a rotation g such that g(blue set) = red set. But since the red set is the complement of the blue set, this would imply that applying rotation g twice maps blue set to itself. Because g(blue) = red, and then applying g again would map red to g(red) =
