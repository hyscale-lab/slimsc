Okay, so I've got this problem here where I need to find the largest possible real part of the expression \[(75 + 117i)z + \frac{96 + 144i}{z}\], where \( z \) is a complex number with \( |z| = 4 \). Hmm, I'm a bit unsure where to start, but I'll try to break it down step by step.

First, I remember that any complex number \( z \) can be expressed in polar form as \( z = re^{i\theta} \), where \( r \) is the modulus and \( \theta \) is the argument. Since \( |z| = 4 \), that means \( r = 4 \). So, I can write \( z = 4e^{i\theta} \). Cool, that simplifies things a bit.

Now, substituting \( z = 4e^{i\theta} \) into the expression, I get:

\[
(75 + 117i) \cdot 4e^{i\theta} + \frac{96 + 144i}{4e^{i\theta}}
\]

Let me compute each part separately. Let's first compute \( (75 + 117i) \cdot 4e^{i\theta} \). That would be \( 4 \cdot (75 + 117i) \cdot e^{i\theta} \). Let me compute the scalar multiplication first: 4 times each component.

4 times 75 is 300, and 4 times 117 is 468. So, that part becomes \( 300 + 468i \) multiplied by \( e^{i\theta} \). Hmm, I know that multiplying a complex number by \( e^{i\theta} \) is equivalent to rotating it by \( \theta \) radians. So, the expression becomes:

\[
(300 + 468i)e^{i\theta} + \frac{96 + 144i}{4e^{i\theta}}
\]

Wait, the second term is \( \frac{96 + 144i}{4e^{i\theta}} \). Let me compute that. Dividing by \( 4e^{i\theta} \) is the same as multiplying by \( \frac{1}{4}e^{-i\theta} \). So, \( (96 + 144i) \times \frac{1}{4}e^{-i\theta} \) becomes \( (24 + 36i)e^{-i\theta} \).

So now, the entire expression is:

\[
(300 + 468i)e^{i\theta} + (24 + 36i)e^{-i\theta}
\]

Hmm, this looks a bit complicated, but I think I can express each term in terms of sine and cosine. Since \( e^{i\theta} = \cos\theta + i\sin\theta \) and \( e^{-i\theta} = \cos\theta - i\sin\theta \), I can expand these terms.

Let me represent \( 300 + 468i \) as \( A \), and \( 24 + 36i \) as \( B \) for simplicity. So, the expression becomes \( A e^{i\theta} + B e^{-i\theta} \). Let me compute each part.

Expanding \( A e^{i\theta} \):

\( A e^{i\theta} = (300 + 468i)(\cos\theta + i\sin\theta) \)
= \( 300\cos\theta + 300i\sin\theta + 468i\cos\theta + 468i^2\sin\theta \)
Since \( i^2 = -1 \), this becomes:
= \( 300\cos\theta + 300i\sin\theta + 468i\cos\theta - 468\sin\theta \)
Grouping real and imaginary parts:
= \( [300\cos\theta - 468\sin\theta] + i[300\sin\theta + 468\cos\theta] \)

Similarly, expanding \( B e^{-i\theta} \):

\( B e^{-i\theta} = (24 + 36i)(\cos\theta - i\sin\theta) \)
= \( 24\cos\theta - 24i\sin\theta + 36i\cos\theta - 36i^2\sin\theta \)
Again, \( i^2 = -1 \), so:
= \( 24\cos\theta - 24i\sin\theta + 36i\cos\theta + 36\sin\theta \)
Grouping real and imaginary parts:
= \( [24\cos\theta + 36\sin\theta] + i[-24\sin\theta + 36\cos\theta] \)

Now, adding the two expanded terms together:

Real parts:
= \( [300\cos\theta - 468\sin\theta] + [24\cos\theta + 36\sin\theta] \)
= \( (300 + 24)\cos\theta + (-468 + 36)\sin\theta \)
= \( 324\cos\theta - 432\sin\theta \)

Imaginary parts:
= \( [300\sin\theta + 468\cos\theta] + [-24\sin\theta + 36\cos\theta] \)
= \( (300 - 24)\sin\theta + (468 + 36)\cos\theta \)
= \( 276\sin\theta + 504\cos\theta \)

So, the entire expression simplifies to:

\[
(324\cos\theta - 432\sin\theta) + i(276\sin\theta + 504\cos\theta)
\]

But we're interested in the real part of this expression. So, the real part is:

\[
324\cos\theta - 432\sin\theta
\]

We need to find the maximum value of this real part as \( \theta \) varies. Hmm, okay, so it's a function of \( \theta \), and we can treat it as a function \( f(\theta) = 324\cos\theta - 432\sin\theta \). We need to find the maximum of this function.

I remember that expressions of the form \( a\cos\theta + b\sin\theta \) can be rewritten as \( R\cos(\theta + \phi) \), where \( R = \sqrt{a^2 + b^2} \) and \( \phi = \arctan\left(\frac{b}{a}\right) \) or something like that. Wait, but actually, the general formula is \( a\cos\theta + b\sin\theta = R\cos(\theta - \phi) \), where \( R = \sqrt{a^2 + b^2} \) and \( \phi = \arctan\left(\frac{b}{a}\right) \). 

Wait, in our case, the expression is \( 324\cos\theta - 432\sin\theta \), which can be seen as \( a = 324 \) and \( b = -432 \). So, substituting these into the formula, \( R = \sqrt{324^2
