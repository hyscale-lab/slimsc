Alright, so I have this problem here about rectangular boxes with a surface area of 54 and volume of 23. I need to find the radius squared of the smallest sphere that can contain any of these boxes, and then express that as a fraction p/q where p and q are coprime, and finally find p+q. Hmm, okay, let's break this down.

First, let's recall some basic formulas. For a rectangular box with side lengths x, y, z, the surface area S is 2(xy + yz + xz), and the volume V is xyz. The sphere that can contain the box must have a diameter at least as large as the space diagonal of the box. The space diagonal d is given by sqrt(x² + y² + z²), so the radius r would be half of that, which is (1/2)sqrt(x² + y² + z²). Therefore, r² would be (x² + y² + z²)/4. So, my goal is to minimize x² + y² + z² given that the surface area is 54 and the volume is 23.

Wait, actually, I think I need to maximize or minimize (x² + y² + z²) under the constraints of surface area and volume. Since the sphere must contain all such boxes, I should find the maximum value of x² + y² + z² given the constraints, because that would give me the largest possible space diagonal, hence the radius needed for the smallest sphere that can contain all boxes.

Alternatively, maybe I should think about optimizing x²+y²+z² given the constraints S=54 and V=23. So, perhaps using Lagrange multipliers or some method to find extrema under constraints.

Let me write down the given constraints:

1. Surface area: 2(xy + yz + xz) = 54 => xy + yz + xz = 27.
2. Volume: xyz = 23.

We need to find the maximum of x² + y² + z².

Hmm, okay. So, to find the maximum of x² + y² + z² given these constraints, I might need to set up a Lagrangian with two constraints. Let me think about how to approach this.

Alternatively, maybe I can express x, y, z in terms of symmetric variables or use inequalities.

Wait, I remember that for positive real numbers, (x + y + z)^2 = x² + y² + z² + 2(xy + yz + xz). We know xy + yz + xz = 27, so (x + y + z)^2 = x² + y² + z² + 54. Therefore, x² + y² + z² = (x + y + z)^2 - 54. So, to maximize x² + y² + z², I need to maximize (x + y + z)^2, which is equivalent to maximizing x + y + z.

Alternatively, maybe not. Wait, if I can find the maximum of x² + y² + z² given the constraints, that might be possible. But perhaps it's easier to consider that for fixed surface area and volume, the shape that minimizes the space diagonal is a cube, but in this case, I think the maximum space diagonal occurs when the box is as "stretched out" as possible given the constraints.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Maybe I should use Lagrange multipliers.

Let me set up the function to maximize: f(x,y,z) = x² + y² + z².

Subject to two constraints:

g1(x,y,z) = xy + yz + xz = 27,

g2(x,y,z) = xyz = 23.

So, the method of Lagrange multipliers for two constraints involves setting up the gradient of f equal to a linear combination of the gradients of g1 and g2.

So, ∇f = λ∇g1 + μ∇g2.

Compute the gradients:

∇f = (2x, 2y, 2z)

∇g1 = (y + z, x + z, x + y)

∇g2 = (yz, xz, xy)

So, setting up the equations:

2x = λ(y + z) + μ(yz)   ...(1)

2y = λ(x + z) + μ(xz)   ...(2)

2z = λ(x + y) + μ(xy)   ...(3)

And the constraints:

xy + yz + xz = 27        ...(4)

xyz = 23                 ...(5)

Hmm, okay, so we have five equations with five unknowns: x, y, z, λ, μ.

This seems a bit complicated, but maybe we can find some symmetry or relations between x, y, z.

Suppose that x = y = z. That would be a cube. But in that case, 3x² = 27 => x² = 9 => x=3. Then volume would be 27, which is more than 23, so it's not a cube.

Therefore, the solution is not a cube, so x, y, z are not all equal. Maybe two variables are equal, and the third is different. Let's try that.

Let’s suppose that x = y ≠ z. Then, let's set x = y.

So, with x = y, let's rewrite the constraints.

g1: x² + 2xz = 27.

g2: x² z = 23.

So, from g2: z = 23/(x²).

Substitute into g1: x² + 2x*(23/(x²)) = 27.

Simplify:

x² + (46/x) = 27.

Multiply both sides by x:

x³ + 46 = 27x.

So, x³ -27x +46 =0.

Let me try to solve this cubic equation.

Looking for rational roots, possible roots are factors of 46 over 1, so ±1, ±2, ±23, ±46.

Testing x=1: 1 -27 +46 =20≠0.

x=2: 8 -54 +46=0. Oh, x=2 is a root.

So, factor out (x -2):

Using polynomial division or synthetic division:

Divide x³ -27x +46 by (x - 2).

Coefficients: 1 0 -27 46

Bring down 1.

Multiply by 2: 2.

Add to next coefficient: 0 +2=2.

Multiply by 2:4.

Add to next coefficient: -27+4=-23.

Multiply by 2: -46.

Add to last coefficient:46 + (-46)=0.

So, the cubic factors as (x -2)(x² + 2x -23) =0.

So, roots are x=2 and x = [-2 ± sqrt(4 +92)]/2 = [-2 ± sqrt(96)]/2 = (-2 ± 4*sqrt(6))/2 = -1 ± 2sqrt(6).

We are dealing with positive lengths, so x=2, or x= -1 + 2sqrt(6) ≈ -1 +4.898 ≈3.898.

So, possible x=2 or x≈3.898.

Let me check x=2: Then, z=23/(x²)=23/4=5.75.

So, the box would be (2,2,5.75). Let's compute x² + y² + z² = 4 +4 + (5.75)^2 =8 + 33.0625=41.0625.

If x= -1 + 2sqrt(6) ≈3.898, then z=23/(x²) ≈23/( ( -1 +2sqrt(6) )^2 )

Let’s compute (-1 +2sqrt(6))² =1 -4sqrt(6) + 24=25 -4sqrt(6).

So, z=23/(25 -4sqrt(6)).

Hmm, rationalize the denominator:

Multiply numerator and denominator by (25 +4sqrt(6)):

z=23*(25 +4sqrt(6)) / [ (25)^2 - (4sqrt(6))^2 ] =23*(25 +4sqrt(6))/(625 - 16*6)=23*(25 +4sqrt(6))/(625-96)=23*(25 +4sqrt(6))/529.

Simplify 23/529=1/23.

So, z=(25
