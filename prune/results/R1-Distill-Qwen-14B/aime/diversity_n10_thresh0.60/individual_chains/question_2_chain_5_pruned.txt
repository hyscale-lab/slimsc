Okay, so I'm trying to solve this geometry problem. Let me read it again and make sure I understand all the parts.

We have three points: O at (0,0), A at (1/2, 0), and B at (0, sqrt(3)/2). So, O is the origin, A is somewhere on the x-axis, and B is on the y-axis. Then, there's a family of segments F, which are all segments PQ of unit length lying in the first quadrant. Each of these segments has point P on the x-axis and Q on the y-axis. So, PQ is a unit-length segment from the x-axis to the y-axis in the first quadrant.

Then, the problem says there's a unique point C on segment AB, distinct from A and B, that doesn't belong to any other segment from F except AB itself. So, C is on AB, and it's only on AB from the family F; no other PQ in F passes through C. We need to find OC squared, which is the square of the distance from the origin to point C. Then, express it as p/q where p and q are coprime, and find p + q.

Hmm, okay. Let me visualize this. O is the origin, A is at (1/2, 0), B is at (0, sqrt(3)/2). So, the segment AB connects these two points, forming a line in the first quadrant. The family F consists of all unit segments from the x-axis to the y-axis in the first quadrant. Each such segment is like a little stick of length 1, with one end on the x-axis and the other on the y-axis.

So, for example, any segment PQ where P is (p, 0) and Q is (0, q) such that the distance between P and Q is 1. So, the distance formula gives sqrt(p² + q²) = 1, right? So, p² + q² = 1.

So, all such segments PQ satisfy p² + q² = 1. And each such segment is in the first quadrant, so p and q are positive.

Now, the point C is on AB, not equal to A or B, and it's unique in that it doesn't lie on any other segment from F except AB. So, AB is one of these segments, because A is on the x-axis and B is on the y-axis, and the distance between A and B should be 1.

Wait, let me check that. The distance between A and B is sqrt[(1/2 - 0)^2 + (0 - sqrt(3)/2)^2] = sqrt[(1/4) + (3/4)] = sqrt(1) = 1. So yes, AB is indeed a segment in F with length 1.

So, AB is one such PQ segment. Now, C is another point on AB. The claim is that there's only one such C on AB that isn't on any other PQ from F. So, for any other PQ segment, C is not on it.

So, I need to find point C on AB such that it's not on any other PQ in F except AB itself.

How do I approach this?

I think I need to find the equation of AB first. Let's find the equation of the line AB.

Point A is (1/2, 0), point B is (0, sqrt(3)/2). So, the slope of AB is (sqrt(3)/2 - 0)/(0 - 1/2) = (sqrt(3)/2) / (-1/2) = -sqrt(3). So, the slope is -sqrt(3).

So, the equation of AB is y - 0 = -sqrt(3)(x - 1/2). Simplifying, y = -sqrt(3)x + (sqrt(3)/2).

So, any point C on AB can be parameterized. Let me let t be a parameter between 0 and 1, where t=0 is point A and t=1 is point B.

So, parametric equations:

x(t) = (1/2)(1 - t)

y(t) = (sqrt(3)/2) t

So, when t=0, x=1/2, y=0, which is A. When t=1, x=0, y=sqrt(3)/2, which is B. For t between 0 and 1, we have points along AB.

Now, if I can write the coordinates of C as ( (1 - t)/2, (sqrt(3)/2)t ). So, C is ( (1 - t)/2, (sqrt(3)/2)t ) for some t in (0,1).

Now, the condition is that C is not on any other PQ segment from F except AB itself. So, for any other segment PQ (other than AB), C is not on that PQ.

So, we need to find t such that C is on AB and not on any other PQ in F.

Let me think about how to characterize all the segments PQ in F. Each PQ is a line segment from (p, 0) to (0, q) where p² + q² = 1. So, for each p in (0,1), q is sqrt(1 - p²). But the segments can also be represented as lines with equation (x/p) + (y/q) = 1, because it's a line intercepting x-axis at p and y-axis at q.

So, the equation of PQ is x/p + y/q = 1, with p² + q² = 1.

So, any point (x, y) on PQ satisfies x/p + y/q = 1.

Given that, if point C is on AB and on another PQ, then it must satisfy both the equation of AB and the equation of PQ.

But since C is on AB, which is already a PQ segment in F, we need to ensure that for any other PQ in F, C is not on that PQ.

Therefore, we need to find point C on AB such that if we substitute x and y into the equation x/p + y/q = 1, there are no solutions (p, q) other than p = 1/2 and q = sqrt(3)/2.

Wait, that sounds promising. So, if we take the coordinates of C, which are ( (1 - t)/2, (sqrt(3)/2)t ), and substitute into the equation x/p + y/q = 1, then for all p² + q² = 1, except p=1/2 and q=sqrt(3)/2, we should not have equality.

But actually, since C is on AB, which is already a PQ segment, we need to find C such that for all other PQ segments, C is not on them.

So, substituting C's coordinates into the equation x/p + y/q = 1, we get:

[(1 - t)/2]/p + [ (sqrt(3)/2) t ] / q = 1.

But since p² + q² = 1, q = sqrt(1 - p²).

So, the equation becomes:

[(1 - t)/(2p)] + [ (sqrt(3) t )/(2 sqrt(1 - p²)) ] = 1.

We need to find t such that this equation has no solution except when p = 1/2 and q = sqrt(3)/2.

So, for this equation to have no solutions except p = 1/2, the equation must be such that when we substitute any p (other than 1/2), we cannot satisfy the equation.

Alternatively, for a given t, the equation in p should have only one solution, which is p = 1/2, but we want t such that no other p (other than 1/2) satisfies the equation. So, we can approach this by finding t such that the equation has only p = 1/2 as its solution.
