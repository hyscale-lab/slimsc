Okay, so I've got this math problem here about a 2x3 grid. I need to figure out how many ways I can fill each cell with a digit (0 through 9) such that two conditions are met. 

First, when I read the grid left to right on the top row and the bottom row, each forms a number, and their sum is 999. Second, when I read the grid top to bottom for each column, each forms a number, and their sum is 99. 

The example given is a grid where the top row is 0, 0, 8, making 008 which is 8, and the bottom row is 9, 9, 1, making 991. Adding those gives 8 + 991 = 999, which fits the first condition. Then, reading top to bottom for each column: 0 and 9 gives 09, which is 9; 0 and 9 gives 09, which is 9; and 8 and 1 gives 81. Adding those together: 9 + 9 + 81 = 99, which fits the second condition.

So, I need to find all such possible grids. Let me try to break this down.

Let me denote the grid as follows:

Top row: A, B, C
Bottom row: D, E, F

So, the top number is ABC, and the bottom number is DEF. The sum ABC + DEF = 999.

But since ABC is a 3-digit number, and DEF is also a 3-digit number, their sum is 999. So, ABC + DEF = 999. That means DEF = 999 - ABC.

Similarly, when reading top to bottom for each column, the numbers are AD, BE, CF. So, AD + BE + CF = 99. Since each column is a two-digit number, right? Because each column has two cells, one on top of the other.

Wait, no, wait. Wait, no, each column has two cells, so each column's number is a two-digit number. So, AD is the number formed by A and D, which is 10*A + D, right? Similarly for BE and CF.

So, the sum (10A + D) + (10B + E) + (10C + F) = 99.

But from the first condition, we have ABC + DEF = 999.

Let me write ABC as 100A + 10B + C, and DEF as 100D + 10E + F. So, adding them together:

(100A + 10B + C) + (100D + 10E + F) = 999

Which can be written as:

100(A + D) + 10(B + E) + (C + F) = 999.

Hmm, that's interesting. Let's note that equation.

Equation 1: 100(A + D) + 10(B + E) + (C + F) = 999.

And from the column sum condition:

Equation 2: (10A + D) + (10B + E) + (10C + F) = 99.

Wait, perhaps I can express Equation 2 in terms of variables:

Equation 2: 10A + D + 10B + E + 10C + F = 99

That's 10(A + B + C) + (D + E + F) = 99.

Hmm, okay. So, I have two equations:

1. 100(A + D) + 10(B + E) + (C + F) = 999.

2. 10(A + B + C) + (D + E + F) = 99.

I need to find digits A, B, C, D, E, F (each from 0 to 9) that satisfy both equations.

Let me think about how to approach this. Maybe I can express variables from one equation and substitute into the other.

Looking at Equation 2: 10(A + B + C) + (D + E + F) = 99.

Let me denote S = A + B + C and T = D + E + F. Then Equation 2 becomes:

10S + T = 99.

Which implies that T = 99 - 10S.

But since T is the sum of three digits, D, E, F, each between 0 and 9, so T must be between 0 and 27.

Similarly, S is the sum of A, B, C, each between 0 and 9, so S is between 0 and 27.

But from T = 99 - 10S, since T must be between 0 and 27, let's see:

99 - 10S ≥ 0 ⇒ 10S ≤ 99 ⇒ S ≤ 9.9 ⇒ S ≤ 9.

And 99 - 10S ≤ 27 ⇒ 99 - 27 ≤ 10S ⇒ 72 ≤ 10S ⇒ S ≥ 7.2 ⇒ S ≥ 8.

So S must be an integer between 8 and 9, inclusive.

Wait, because S is the sum of three digits, each 0-9, so S can be 8 or 9.

Wait, 7.2 ≤ S ≤ 9.9 ⇒ S is integer, so S can be 8 or 9.

So, two possibilities:

Case 1: S = 8 ⇒ T = 99 - 10*8 = 99 - 80 = 19.

Case 2: S = 9 ⇒ T = 99 - 10*9 = 99 - 90 = 9.

So, now, we have two cases to consider.

Also, from Equation 1:

100(A + D) + 10(B + E) + (C + F) = 999.

Let me denote U = A + D, V = B + E, W = C + F.

Then Equation 1 becomes:

100U + 10V + W = 999.

But U, V, W are sums of digits, so each can be from 0 to 18.

But 100U + 10V + W = 999.

So, let's see:

999 divided by 100 is 9.99. So U must be 9, because 100*10=1000 would be too much.

Wait, 100*9 = 900. Then 100U is 900, so 10V + W = 99.

So, equation becomes:

10V + W = 99.

But V and W are sums of two digits each. So V can
