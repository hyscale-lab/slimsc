Okay, let's try to solve this system of logarithmic equations. So, we have three equations:

1. log₂(x/(yz)) = 1/2
2. log₂(y/(xz)) = 1/3
3. log₂(z/(xy)) = 1/4

And we need to find the absolute value of log₂(x⁴y³z²), which will be a fraction m/n, then find m + n.

Hmm, logarithms can sometimes be tricky, but I remember that log₂(a/b) = log₂ a - log₂ b, so maybe I can rewrite each equation using that property.

Let me write each equation in terms of logs.

Starting with the first equation:

log₂(x) - log₂(y) - log₂(z) = 1/2.

Similarly, the second equation:

log₂(y) - log₂(x) - log₂(z) = 1/3.

And the third equation:

log₂(z) - log₂(x) - log₂(y) = 1/4.

Hmm, okay, so now we have three equations with three variables: log₂(x), log₂(y), log₂(z). Let's assign variables to make it easier. Let me let:

a = log₂(x),
b = log₂(y),
c = log₂(z).

So now the equations become:

1. a - b - c = 1/2
2. -a + b - c = 1/3
3. -a - b + c = 1/4

So now we have a system of three linear equations with three variables a, b, c.

Let me write them again:

1. a - b - c = 1/2
2. -a + b - c = 1/3
3. -a - b + c = 1/4

I need to solve for a, b, c. Let me try to add and subtract these equations to eliminate variables.

Maybe adding equation 1 and equation 2. Let's see:

Equation 1: a - b - c = 1/2
Equation 2: -a + b - c = 1/3
Adding them:
( a - a ) + (-b + b) + (-c - c) = 1/2 + 1/3
Simplifies to:
0 + 0 - 2c = 5/6
So, -2c = 5/6 => c = -5/(6*2) = -5/12.

Wait, c is negative? But z is a positive real number, so log₂(z) could be negative if z is between 0 and 1. Okay, that's fine.

So c = -5/12.

Now, let's try adding another pair. Maybe equation 1 and equation 3.

Equation 1: a - b - c = 1/2
Equation 3: -a - b + c = 1/4
Adding them:
(a - a) + (-b - b) + (-c + c) = 1/2 + 1/4
Which becomes:
0 - 2b + 0 = 3/4
So, -2b = 3/4 => b = -3/(4*2) = -3/8.

Hmm, b is also negative. So log₂(y) is negative, meaning y is less than 1.

Now, we have b = -3/8 and c = -5/12.

Now, let's find a. Let's use equation 1: a - b - c = 1/2

Substituting b and c:

a - (-3/8) - (-5/12) = 1/2

Simplify:

a + 3/8 + 5/12 = 1/2

Let me find a common denominator for the fractions. 8 and 12 have a common denominator of 24.

So, 3/8 = 9/24, 5/12 = 10/24.

Adding them: 9/24 + 10/24 = 19/24.

So, a + 19/24 = 1/2.

1/2 is 12/24, so:

a = 12/24 - 19/24 = (12 - 19)/24 = (-7)/24.

So, a = -7/24.

So now, a = log₂(x) = -7/24,
b = log₂(y) = -3/8,
c = log₂(z) = -5/12.

Double-checking these values with the equations:

Equation 2: -a + b - c = 1/3
Substitute a, b, c:
-(-7/24) + (-3/8) - (-5/12) = 7/24 - 3/8 + 5/12.

Convert all to 24 denominators:

7/24 - 9/24 + 10/24 = (7 -9 +10)/24 = 8/24 = 1/3. Correct.

Equation 3: -a - b + c = 1/4
Substitute:
-(-7/24) - (-3/8) + (-5/12) = 7/24 + 3/8 -5/12.

Convert to 24 denominators:
7/24 + 9/24 -10/24 = (7 +9 -10)/24 =6/24=1/4. Correct.

So, all equations are satisfied.

Now, we need to find |log₂(x⁴y³z²)|.

Let's compute log₂(x⁴y³z²) first.

Using logarithm properties: log₂(x⁴) + log₂(y³) + log₂(z²) = 4 log₂(x) + 3 log₂(y) + 2 log₂(z).

Which is 4a + 3b + 2c.

Substituting the values of a, b, c:

4*(-7/24) + 3*(-3/8) + 2*(-5/12).

Let me compute each term:

4*(-7/24) = (-28)/24 = -7/6.

3*(-3/8) = (-9)/8.

2*(-5/12) = (-10)/12 = (-5)/6.

Now, adding them all together:

-7/6 -9/8 -5/6.

Combine the fractions. Let's find a common denominator. 6 and 8 have 24 as LCD.

Convert each fraction:

-7/6 = -28/24,

-9/8 = -27/24,

-5/6 = -20/24.

So adding: (-28 -27 -20)/24 = (-75)/24.

Simplify: -75/24. Let's see if this can be reduced. 75 and 24 are both divisible by 3.

75 ÷3=25, 24 ÷3=8. So -25/8.

So log₂(x⁴y³z²) = -25/8. The absolute value is 25/8.

So |log₂(x⁴y³z²)| =25/8.

So m=25, n=8. They are coprime.

Thus, m + n =25 +8=33.

**Final Answer**
\boxed{33}


Given the system of logarithmic equations:

1. \(\log_2\left(\frac{x}{yz}\right) = \frac{1}{2}\)
2. \(\log_2\left(\frac{y}{xz}\right) = \frac{1}{3}\)
3. \(\log_2\left(\frac{z}{xy}\right) = \frac{1}{4}\)

We convert these logarithmic equations into linear equations by letting \(a = \log_2(x)\), \(b = \log_2(y)\), and \(c = \log_2(z)\). This gives us the system:

1. \(a - b - c = \frac{1}{2}\)
2. \(-a + b - c = \frac{1}{3}\)
3. \(-a - b + c = \frac{1}{4}\)

We solve this system step-by-step:

1. Adding equations 1 and 2:
   \[
   (a - b - c) + (-a + b - c) = \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{3}
   \]
   Simplifies to:
   \[
   -2c = \frac{5}{6} \implies c = -\frac{5}{12}
   \]

2. Adding equations 1 and 3:
   \[
   (a - b - c) + (-a - b + c) = \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{4}
   \]
   Simplifies to:
   \[
   -2b = \frac{3}{4} \implies b = -\frac{3}{8}
   \]

3. Substituting \(b\) and \(c\) into equation 1:
   \[
   a - \left(-\frac{3}{8}\right) - \left(-\frac{5}{12}\right) = \frac{1}{2}
   \]
   Simplifies to:
   \[
   a + \frac{3}{8} + \frac{5}{12} = \frac{1}{2}
   \]
   Converting to a common denominator:
   \[
   a + \frac{9}{24} + \frac{10}{24} = \frac{12}{24}
   \]
   Simplifies to:
   \[
   a = \frac{12}{24} - \frac{19}{24} = -\frac{7}{24}
   \]

Now, we have \(a = -\frac{7}{24}\), \(b = -\frac{3}{8}\), and \(c = -\frac{5}{12}\).

We need to find \(|\log_2(x^4y^3z^2)|\):

\[
\log_2(x^4y^3z^2) = 4a + 3b + 2c
\]
Substituting the values:
\[
4\left(-\frac{7}{24}\right) + 3\left(-\frac{3}{8}\right) + 2\left(-\frac{5}{12}\right)
\]
Simplifying each term:
\[
-\frac{28}{24} - \frac{9}{8} - \frac{10}{12} = -\frac{7}{6} - \frac{9}{8} - \frac{5}{6}
\]
Converting to a common denominator:
\[
-\frac{28}{24} - \frac{27}{24} - \frac{20}{24} = -\frac{75}{24} = -\frac{25}{8}
\]
Taking the absolute value:
\[
\left| -\frac{25}{8} \right| = \frac{25}{8}
\]

Thus, the value is \(\frac{25}{8}\), and \(m + n = 25 + 8 = 33\).

\[
\boxed{33}
\]
