Okay, so I have this problem about a tetrahedron ABCD. The edges are given with specific lengths: AB and CD are sqrt(41), AC and BD are sqrt(80), and BC and AD are sqrt(89). I need to find the distance from the incenter (which is the point equidistant from all faces) to each face. The answer should be in the form m*sqrt(n)/p, where m, n, p are positive integers, m and p are coprime, and n is square-free. Then I have to find m + n + p.

Hmm, tetrahedrons can be tricky. First, I remember that in a tetrahedron, the inradius can be found using the formula:

r = 3V / S

where V is the volume of the tetrahedron and S is the total surface area. So, I think I need to find both the volume and the surface area.

But wait, how do I find the surface area? Each face is a triangle. If I can find the area of each face, then sum them up to get S. But the problem is, I don't know the exact shape of the tetrahedron, so maybe all faces are congruent or something? Let me check the edges.

Looking at the edges:

AB = CD = sqrt(41)
AC = BD = sqrt(80)
BC = AD = sqrt(89)

So, opposite edges are equal. That suggests that the tetrahedron is "isohedral" or something? Wait, no, isohedral usually means all faces are the same, which might not necessarily be the case here. Alternatively, it could be that the tetrahedron is "equifacial," but I'm not sure.

Wait, maybe it's a kind of symmetrical tetrahedron. Let me think. Since opposite edges are equal, this might be a tetragonal disphenoid. I think a disphenoid is a tetrahedron where opposite edges are equal, so that fits. In a disphenoid, all four faces are congruent. So, if all faces are congruent, then each face has the same area, so S would just be 4 times the area of one face.

Wait, but in this case, are the faces congruent? Let me check. Each face is a triangle with edges as
