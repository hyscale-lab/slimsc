Okay, so I've got this problem here where I need to find the number of triples of nonnegative integers (a, b, c) that satisfy two conditions: a + b + c = 300 and a²b + a²c + b²a + b²c + c²a + c²b = 6,000,000.

Hmm, let me start by understanding what each condition implies. The first condition is straightforward—it's a linear equation. The second one looks more complicated; it's a combination of terms where each variable is squared and multiplied by another variable. Maybe I can simplify or factor this somehow.

Let me write down the equations again:

1. a + b + c = 300
2. a²b + a²c + b²a + b²c + c²a + c²b = 6,000,000

For the second equation, I notice that each term is of the form x²y where x and y are different variables. So, it's symmetric in a, b, c but not entirely symmetric because each term has two different variables. Let me try to factor it or see if I can express it in terms of some known identity.

Wait, another thought—if I factor the second equation, maybe I can group terms. Let me look at the terms:

a²b + a²c = a²(b + c)
Similarly, b²a + b²c = b²(a + c)
And c²a + c²b = c²(a + b)

So, the entire expression can be written as:

a²(b + c) + b²(a + c) + c²(a + b)

But since a + b + c = 300, I can express (b + c) as (300 - a), (a + c) as (300 - b), and (a + b) as (300 - c). Let's substitute these into the equation.

So the second equation becomes:

a²(300 - a) + b²(300 - b) + c²(300 - c) = 6,000,000.

Hmm, that's a bit more manageable. Let me write that as:

300a² - a³ + 300b² - b³ + 300c² - c³ = 6,000,000.

I can factor out the 300:

300(a² + b² + c²) - (a³ + b³ + c³) = 6,000,000.

Divide both sides by 300 to simplify:

(a² + b² + c²) - (a³ + b³ + c³)/300 = 20,000.

Hmm, that doesn't seem too helpful. Maybe I should look for another approach.

Alternatively, I recall that sometimes in symmetric equations, we can use substitutions based on symmetric sums. Let me denote S1 = a + b + c = 300, S2 = ab + bc + ac, and S3 = abc.

But wait, in the given equation, the terms are a²b + a²c + b²a + b²c + c²a + c²b. Let me see if this can be expressed in terms of S1, S2, S3.

I remember that a²b + a²c + b²a + b²c + c²a + c²b = (a + b + c)(ab + bc + ac) - 3abc.

Wait, let me check that. Let's expand (a + b + c)(ab + bc + ac):

= a(ab + bc + ac) + b(ab + bc + ac) + c(ab + bc + ac)
= a²b + a b c + a² c + a b² + b² c + b a c + a c² + b c² + c a c
Wait, that's more terms than I have. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake.

Let me compute (a + b + c)(ab + bc + ac) step by step.

First, distribute each term:

a*(ab) = a²b
a*(bc) = a b c
a*(ac) = a² c
b*(ab) = a b²
b*(bc) = b² c
b*(ac) = a b c
c*(ab) = a b c
c*(bc) = b c²
c*(ac) = a c²

So, adding all these up, we have:

a²b + a b c + a² c + a b² + b² c + a b c + a b c + b c² + a c²

So grouping like terms:

= a²b + a²c + a b² + b²c + a c² + b c² + 3 a b c

So, (a + b + c)(ab + bc + ac) = a²b + a²c + a b² + b²c + a c² + b c² + 3abc.

But in our given equation, the sum is a²b + a²c + b²a + b²c + c²a + c²b, which is equal to a²b + a²c + a b² + b²c + a c² + b c². So that's the same as (a + b + c)(ab + bc + ac) - 3abc.

Therefore, the given equation becomes:

(a + b + c)(ab + bc + ac) - 3abc = 6,000,000.

We know that a + b + c = 300, so substituting that in:

300*(ab + bc + ac) - 3abc = 6,000,000.

Let me denote S = ab + bc + ac and P = abc. Then the equation becomes:

300 S - 3 P = 6,000,000.

Divide both sides by 3:

100 S - P = 2,000,000.

So, 100 S - P = 2,000,000. Let's note that as equation (1).

Additionally, we know from the first condition that a + b + c = 300, which is S1 = 300.

So, now we have two equations involving S and P:

1. S1 = 300
2. 100 S - P = 2,000,000.

But we need more information to relate S and P. Maybe we can use the identity for (a + b + c)^3 to relate S and P.

I remember that:

(a + b + c)^3 = a^3 + b^3 + c^3 + 3(a + b)(b + c)(c + a).

Wait, no, that's not quite right. Let me think again.

The correct identity is:

(a + b + c)^3 = a^3 + b^3 + c^3 + 3(a + b)(a + c)(b + c).

Wait, no, actually, another way.

The correct identity is:

(a + b + c)^3 = a^3 + b^3 + c^3 + 3(a + b)(a + c) + 3(b + c)(a + b) + 3(c + a)(b + c). Hmm, maybe I'm mixing it up.

Wait, actually, the correct expansion is:

(a + b + c)^3 = a^3 + b^3 + c^3 + 3(a + b)(a + c) + 3
