Alright, let's try to tackle this problem. It's about a tetrahedron with specific edge lengths and finding the distance from the incenter to each face. Hmm, okay, I remember that in a tetrahedron, the incenter is the point equidistant from all four faces. That distance is like the radius of the inscribed sphere, or inradius.

The given tetrahedron has edges AB and CD equal to sqrt(41), AC and BD equal to sqrt(80), and BC and AD equal to sqrt(89). So, the edges are paired in a symmetric way. Maybe this symmetry can help simplify things.

First, let's note that the tetrahedron is "isohedral," meaning that all its faces are congruent. Wait, no, not necessarily. But the edges are paired, so perhaps it's a kind of symmetrical tetrahedron where opposite edges are equal. That might mean that the tetrahedron is "edge-transitive," but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe it's a disphenoid. I think a disphenoid is a tetrahedron where opposite edges are equal. Yes, that's right. So, this must be a disphenoid.

Disphenoids have some nice properties. In particular, they are tetrahedra where all four faces are congruent triangles, but wait, no. Wait, actually, in a disphenoid, opposite edges are equal, but the faces aren't necessarily congruent. Hmm, but in this case, let's check. The edges are AB=CD=sqrt(41), AC=BD=sqrt(80), and BC=AD=sqrt(89). So, each pair of opposite edges is equal. So, yeah, it's a disphenoid.

Disphenoids have some nice properties, like having an insphere, which is a sphere tangent to all four faces. So, the inradius exists and is the distance we need to find.

To find the inradius, I remember that for a tetrahedron, the formula is 3V / S, where V is the volume, and S is the total surface area. Wait, no, actually, for a tetrahedron, the inradius r is equal to 3V divided by the total surface area. Let me check: yes, in 3D, the formula is V = (
