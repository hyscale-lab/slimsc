Okay, so I need to find the number of triples of nonnegative integers (a, b, c) such that a + b + c = 300 and a²b + a²c + b²a + b²c + c²a + c²b = 6,000,000. Hmm, this looks a bit complicated, but let's try to break it down step by step.

First, I know that a, b, and c are nonnegative integers, so they can be 0 or any positive integer, but their sum is fixed at 300. The second equation is a bit more complex. Let me write it down again:

a²b + a²c + b²a + b²c + c²a + c²b = 6,000,000.

Hmm, I notice that each term is a product of two variables where one is squared. Maybe I can factor this expression somehow. Let me see:

Looking at the terms, I can group them as follows:

a²b + a²c = a²(b + c)
Similarly, b²a + b²c = b²(a + c)
And c²a + c²b = c²(a + b)

So, putting it all together, the expression becomes:

a²(b + c) + b²(a + c) + c²(a + b).

Hmm, that's a bit better. Now, since a + b + c = 300, I can express (b + c) as (300 - a), because a + b + c = 300, so b + c = 300 - a. Similarly, a + c = 300 - b, and a + b = 300 - c.

So substituting these into the expression, we get:

a²(300 - a) + b²(300 - b) + c²(300 - c) = 6,000,000.

Let me compute each term:

a²(300 - a) = 300a² - a³
Similarly, b²(300 - b) = 300b² - b³
And c²(300 - c) = 300c² - c³

So adding them all up:

300a² + 300b² + 300c² - (a³ + b³ + c³) = 6,000,000.

I can factor out the 300 from the first three terms:

300(a² + b² + c²) - (a³ + b³ + c³) = 6,000,000.

Hmm, maybe I can find a way to relate a² + b² + c² and a³ + b³ + c³. I remember some identities involving these terms. Let me recall that (a + b + c)^2 = a² + b² + c² + 2(ab + bc + ca). Since a + b + c is 300, then:

300² = a² + b² + c² + 2(ab + bc + ca)
So, 90,000 = a² + b² + c² + 2(ab + bc + ca).

That means a² + b² + c² = 90,000 - 2(ab + bc + ca). Let me denote S = a + b + c = 300, Q = ab + bc + ca, and P = abc.

Wait, but in the second equation, we also have a³ + b³ + c³. I remember another identity: a³ + b³ + c³ = (a + b + c)^3 - 3(a + b + c)(ab + bc + ca) + 3abc. So:

a³ + b³ + c³ = S³ - 3 S Q + 3 P.

Let me compute S³. Since S is 300, S³ = 300^3 = 27,000,000.

So a³ + b³ + c³ = 27,000,000 - 3*300*Q + 3P
= 27,000,000 - 900 Q + 3P.

Now, going back to the second equation:

300(a² + b² + c²) - (a³ + b³ + c³) = 6,000,000.

Substituting a² + b² + c² = 90,000 - 2Q and a³ + b³ + c³ = 27,000,000 - 900 Q + 3P:

300*(90,000 - 2Q) - (27,000,000 - 900 Q + 3P) = 6,000,000.

Let me compute each part step by step.

First, 300*(90,000 - 2Q) = 300*90,000 - 300*2Q = 27,000,000 - 600 Q.

Subtracting the second term:

27,000,000 - 600 Q - 27,000,000 + 900 Q - 3P = 6,000,000.

Simplify the left side:

(27,000,000 - 27,000,000) + (-600 Q + 900 Q) - 3P = 6,000,000.
So, 0 + 300 Q - 3P = 6,000,000.

Divide both sides by 3:

100 Q - P = 2,000,000.

So, 100 Q - P = 2,000,000. Hmm, that's an equation involving Q and P, which are ab + bc + ca and abc, respectively.

But I also know from symmetric polynomials that for three variables, the elementary symmetric sums are S = a + b + c = 300, Q = ab + bc + ca, and P = abc.

But I need to find all triples (a,b,c) that satisfy these conditions. So, I have two equations:

1. S = 300.
2. 100 Q - P = 2,000,000.

But that's only two equations, and I have three variables (a, b, c). So, perhaps I can find another equation or a way to relate Q and P.

Wait, maybe I can express P in terms of Q from the second equation: P = 100 Q - 2,000,000.

So, P = 100 Q - 2,000,000.

But since a, b, c are nonnegative integers, Q and P must also be nonnegative integers, and P must be nonnegative as well.

So, 100 Q - 2,000,000 ≥ 0 → Q ≥ 20,000.

So, Q must be at least 20,000.

Also, since a, b, c are nonnegative integers, the maximum possible value for Q is when two variables are as large as possible. Let me think: For a + b + c = 300, the maximum value of ab + bc + ca occurs when two variables are as large as possible. For example, if a=300, then b and c are 0, so Q=0. Wait, that's not the maximum. Wait, actually, the maximum of Q occurs when two variables are equal and the third is as small as possible. Let's see, for a fixed sum, the maximum of ab + bc + ca is achieved when two variables are equal and the third is zero. Let me check:

Suppose c=0, then a + b = 300, and Q = ab + 0 + 0 = ab. The maximum of ab when a + b = 300 is at a = b = 150, so ab = 15
