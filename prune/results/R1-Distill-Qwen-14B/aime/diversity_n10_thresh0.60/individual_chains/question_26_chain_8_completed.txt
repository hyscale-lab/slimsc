Okay, so I have this geometry problem here. Let me try to parse it step by step.

We have triangle ABC inscribed in a circle ω. The tangents to ω at points B and C intersect at point D. Then, the line AD intersects ω again at point P. We are given the lengths of the sides: AB is 5, BC is 9, and AC is 10. The question asks for the length of AP, which can be written as a fraction m/n where m and n are coprime. Then, we need to find m + n.

Hmm, okay. Let me think about the properties involved here. Since D is the intersection of the tangents at B and C, I remember that D is the exsymmedian point or the symmedian point? Wait, no, the exsymmedian is related to the external tangent. Hmm, actually, when two tangents are drawn from a point outside the circle to the circle, that point is called the external homothety center or something like that. But more importantly, I think that BD and CD are equal in length because the two tangent segments from a common external point to a circle are congruent.

So, BD = CD. That might be useful.

I also remember that in such configurations, the point D is the ex-pole of the line BC with respect to the circle ω. But maybe that's getting too advanced. Perhaps I should look for something simpler.

Another thought: Since AD intersects the circle again at P, points A, B, C, P are concyclic on ω. So maybe I can use power of a point from point D with respect to ω.

Power of a point D with respect to ω: The power should be equal to DB² = DC² because DB and DC are tangent lengths. So, power of D is DB² = DC² = DP * DA.

Wait, that might be key. So, if I can find the length DA, then I can relate it to DP. But I don't know DA yet. Alternatively, maybe I can express AP in terms of DA and DP.

Because AP is the segment from A to P, which is on AD. So, AP = AD - DP. Or is it the other way around? Wait, depending on where P is. Since D is outside the circle, and AD intersects the circle again at P, then going from A to D, the first intersection is A, then P, then D. Wait, no. Wait, hold on.

Wait, no, AD starts at A, goes through ω at another point P, then continues to D. So, the order is A, P, D on the line AD. So, AP is part of AD from A to P, and PD is from P to D. Therefore, AD = AP + PD.

But using power of point D, which is DB² = DP * DA. So, DB² = DP * DA. Therefore, DP = DB² / DA.

But if I can express everything in terms of AD, maybe I can find AP. Let me write:

AD = AP + DP.

But DP = DB² / AD. So,

AD = AP + (DB² / AD).

Multiplying both sides by AD,

AD² = AP * AD + DB².

Rearranged,

AP * AD = AD² - DB².

Wait, that seems a bit messy, but maybe manageable.

Alternatively, perhaps using Stewart's theorem on triangle ABC or some other theorem. But I might need to find more information.

First, maybe I should compute some lengths in triangle ABC. I have the sides AB=5, BC=9, AC=10. Let me make sure that this is a valid triangle. 5 + 9 > 10? 14 > 10, yes. 5 + 10 > 9? 15 > 9, yes. 9 +10 >5? 19>5, yes. So, it is a valid triangle.

Perhaps it's a good idea to compute the circumradius of triangle ABC, since the circle ω is the circumcircle. If I can find R, the circumradius, then maybe I can find DB, since BD is the tangent from D to ω, which is equal to DC.

Wait, but to find DB, I need more information about D. Alternatively, perhaps I can use coordinates or trigonometry to compute the necessary lengths.

But maybe a better approach is to use inversion or projective geometry, but that might be too complicated for this problem.

Alternatively, perhaps using harmonic division or pole-polar concepts. Since BD and CD are tangents, then line BC is the polar of point D with respect to ω. So, if I can find poles or use harmonic conjugates, maybe that could help.

Wait, another thought: Since D is the intersection of the tangents at B and C, then BD and CD are the two tangents. So, triangle BDC is an isosceles triangle with BD = CD.

Furthermore, angle BDC is equal to 180 - angle BAC, because the angle between two tangents is equal to the difference between 180 and the measure of the intercepted arc, which is equal to twice the angle at A.

Wait, perhaps more accurately, the angle between two tangents from D to the circle is equal to the measure of the arc BC not containing A, which is equal to 2 * angle BAC. Wait, no, let me think.

Actually, the angle between two tangents from a point outside the circle is equal to the difference between 180 degrees and the measure of the central angle subtended by the arc BC. So, angle BDC = 180 - angle BAC.

Wait, perhaps I should compute angle BAC using the Law of Cosines in triangle ABC.

So, in triangle ABC, sides AB=5, BC=9, AC=10.

Let me compute angle BAC. Using Law of Cosines:

cos(angle BAC) = (AB² + AC² - BC²) / (2 * AB * AC)

Plugging in the values:

cos(angle BAC) = (5² + 10² - 9²)/(2 * 5 * 10)
= (25 + 100 - 81)/(100)
= (125 - 81)/100
= 44/100
= 11/25.

So, angle BAC = arccos(11/25). Let's denote this angle as θ. So θ ≈ arccos(0.44) ≈ 63.9 degrees, but I don't think we need the exact value in degrees.

Now, the angle at D, angle BDC, is equal to 180 - θ, because in the circle, the angle between the two tangents is equal to the difference between 180 and the central angle. Wait, no, the angle between two tangents is equal to the measure of the arc intercepted by the tangents but not containing the point. Wait, maybe it's more precise to say that angle BDC is equal to the measure of arc BC that doesn't contain A. Since the measure of an angle formed by two tangents is equal to half the difference of the intercepted arcs. But in this case, since D is outside, angle BDC = (arc BAC - arc BC)/2. Wait, maybe I need to recall the exact theorem.

Wait, the angle between two tangents from an external point D is equal to half the difference of the measures of the intercepted arcs. So, angle BDC = ½ (arc BAC - arc BC). But since arc BAC is the major arc BC, and arc BC is the minor arc BC.

Wait, but in this case, if ABC is our triangle, then arc BC (minor) is 2θ, since the central angle over arc BC is 2θ. Wait, because in the circle, the central angle is twice the inscribed angle. So angle BAC is θ, inscribed angle over arc BC, so the central angle is 2θ.

Therefore, the major arc BC is 360 - 2θ, and the minor arc BC is 2θ. So, angle BDC = ½ (major arc BC - minor arc BC) = ½ (360 - 2θ - 2θ) = ½ (360 - 4θ) = 180 - 2θ.

Wait, perhaps. So, angle BDC = 180 - 2θ, where θ is angle BAC.

But earlier, I found cosθ = 11/25, so θ = arccos(11/25). So, angle BDC would be 180 - 2θ.

Hmm, perhaps that's useful. Since in triangle BDC, we have BD=CD, so it's an isosceles triangle with BD=CD, and angle BDC = 180 - 2θ.

So, in triangle BDC, sides BD=CD, base BC=9, and apex angle 180-2θ.

Wait, so I can compute BD using the Law of Cosines in triangle BDC.

Law of Cosines:

BC² = BD² + CD² - 2 * BD * CD * cos(angle BDC)

But since BD=CD, let's denote BD = CD = x.

So,

9² = x² + x² - 2 * x * x * cos(180 - 2θ)
81 = 2x² - 2x² * cos(180 - 2θ)

But cos(180 - 2θ) = -cos(2θ). So,

81 = 2x² - 2x²*(-cos2θ)
= 2x² + 2x² cos2θ
= 2x² (1 + cos2θ)

So,

81 = 2x² (1 + cos2θ)

We can compute cos2θ. Since we have cosθ = 11/25,

cos2θ = 2cos²θ -1 = 2*(121/625) -1 = 242/625 - 1 = (242 - 625)/625 = (-383)/625.

So,

81 = 2x² [1 + (-383/625)]
= 2x² [ (625 - 383)/625 ]
= 2x² [242/625]
= 2x² * 242 / 625
= (484 x²) / 625

So,

81 = (484 x²) / 625

Multiply both sides by 625:

81 * 625 = 484 x²

Calculate 81 * 625: 81 * 600 = 48,600; 81 *25=2,025; total is 50,625.

So,

50,625 = 484 x²

Then,

x² = 50,625 / 484

Take square root:

x = sqrt(50,625 / 484) = sqrt(50,625)/sqrt(484) = 225 / 22.

Because 225² is 50,625, and 22² is 484.

So, BD = CD = 225/22.

Alright, that's a useful piece of information.

Now, going back to the power of point D with respect to ω: DB² = DP * DA.

We have DB = 225/22, so DB² = (225/22)^2.

But we can write DB² = DP * DA.

So, DP = DB² / DA.

But we need to find AP. Since AD = AP + PD, as per earlier, and PD = DB² / DA.

So,

AD = AP + (DB² / AD)

Multiply both sides by AD:

AD² = AP * AD + DB²

Rearranged:

AP * AD = AD² - DB²

So,

AP = (AD² - DB²) / AD = AD - (DB² / AD)

But that's kind of the same as before. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to express AP in terms of AD.

Wait, but maybe I can find AD using triangle ABD or something.

Wait, let me think. We have triangle ABD, but I don't know any angles or other sides.

Alternatively, perhaps use Stewart's theorem on triangle ABC with cevian AD. But wait, I don't know where D is with respect to ABC. D is outside the triangle, so that might complicate things.

Another idea: Use coordinates. Maybe assign coordinate system to compute coordinates of D and then find intersection point P.

Let me try that approach.

Set coordinate system: Let me place point C at the origin (0, 0). Let me place point A at (10, 0), since AC =10. Then, point B is somewhere in the plane. We can compute coordinates of B using the given side lengths.

Given AB=5, BC=9, and AC=10.

So, coordinate system: C(0,0), A(10, 0). So, point B(x, y) must satisfy the distances:

Distance from B to C is 9: sqrt(x² + y²) =9 → x² + y² =81.

Distance from B to A is 5: sqrt( (x-10)^2 + y² )=5 → (x-10)^2 + y² =25.

Subtracting the first equation from the second:

(x-10)^2 + y² - (x² + y²) =25 -81 → (x² -20x +100) + y² -x² - y² = -56 → -20x +100 = -56 → -20x = -156 → x= 156/20 = 7.8.

So, x=7.8 or 39/5.

Then, plug x=39/5 into x² + y²=81:

(39/5)^2 + y² =81.

Compute (39/5)^2: 39² = 1521, so 1521/25 = 60.84.

So,

60.84 + y² =81 → y²=81 -60.84=20.16.

20.16 is 2016/100, which reduces to 504/25.

So, y= sqrt(504/25)=sqrt(504)/5.

Simplify sqrt(504): 504=16*31.5? Wait, 504=16*31.5? Wait, no.

Wait, 504=16*31.5? Wait, 16*31=496, 16*31.5=504. So, sqrt(504)=sqrt(16*31.5)=4*sqrt(31.5). But 31.5=63/2, so sqrt(504)=4*sqrt(63/2)=4*(sqrt(63)/sqrt(2))=4*(3*sqrt(7)/sqrt(2))=12*sqrt(7/2).

But maybe a better way: 504= 16*31.5=16*(63/2)= (16*63)/2.

Wait, perhaps it's better to factor 504: 504=8*63=8*9*7= 2^3 *3^2 *7.

So sqrt(504)=sqrt(4*126)=2*sqrt(126)=2*sqrt(9*14)=2*3*sqrt(14)=6*sqrt(14).

Wait, let me check:

504 divided by 4 is 126.

126 divided by 9 is 14.

So, 504=4*9*14= (2^2)*(3^2)*14.

So, sqrt(504)=2*3*sqrt(14)=6*sqrt(14).

Therefore, y=6*sqrt(14)/5.

So, coordinates of B are (39/5, 6√14/5).

So, points:

A(10,0), B(39/5, 6√14/5), C(0,0).

Now, we need to find point D, which is the intersection of the two tangents at B and C to circle ω.

So, equation of tangent at B to circle ω.

First, let me find the equation of the circumcircle ω of triangle ABC.

We have points A(10,0), B(39/5, 6√14/5), C(0,0). Let's compute the circumcircle.

The circumcircle passes through A, B, C.

General equation of a circle: x² + y² + Dx + Ey + F =0.

Plug in C(0,0): 0 +0 +0 +0 + F=0 → F=0.

So, equation becomes x² + y² + Dx + Ey =0.

Plug in A(10,0): 100 +0 +10D +0 =0 → 100 +10D=0 → D= -10.

So, equation becomes x² + y² -10x + Ey=0.

Now, plug in point B(39/5, 6√14/5):

(39/5)^2 + (6√14/5)^2 -10*(39/5) + E*(6√14/5)=0.

Compute each term:

(39/5)^2 = (1521)/25.

(6√14/5)^2 = (36*14)/25 = 504/25.

-10*(39/5) = -78.

E*(6√14/5)= (6E√14)/5.

So, equation becomes:

1521/25 + 504/25 -78 + (6E√14)/5 =0.

Sum the first two terms:

(1521 + 504)/25 = 2025/25=81.

So,

81 -78 + (6E√14)/5 =0 → 3 + (6E√14)/5 =0.

Thus,

(6E√14)/5 = -3 → 6E√14 = -15 → E= (-15)/(6√14) = (-5)/(2√14).

Rationalizing the denominator:

E= (-5)/(2√14) * (√14/√14)= (-5√14)/(28).

So, E= (-5√14)/28.

Therefore, the equation of the circle ω is:

x² + y² -10x - (5√14/28)y =0.

Now, find equations of the tangents at B and C.

First, the tangent at C(0,0).

The tangent at a point on a circle can be found using the formula:

For a circle x² + y² + Dx + Ey + F =0, the tangent at (x1,y1) is xx1 + yy1 + D*(x +x1)/2 + E*(y + y1)/2 + F =0.

But since point C is (0,0), and F=0, the tangent at C is:

x*0 + y*0 + D*(x +0)/2 + E*(y +0)/2 +0=0 → (D x)/2 + (E y)/2=0.

Substituting D=-10, E=(-5√14)/28:

(-10 x)/2 + (-5√14 y)/56 =0 → -5x - (5√14 y)/56=0.

Multiply both sides by 56 to eliminate denominator:

-5x*56 -5√14 y =0 → -280x -5√14 y=0.

So, equation is 280x +5√14 y=0.

We can simplify this by dividing by 5: 56x + √14 y=0.

So, the tangent at C is 56x +√14 y=0.

Similarly, find the equation of the tangent at B.

Using the same formula. For point B(39/5, 6√14/5), the tangent is:

x*(39/5) + y*(6√14/5) + D*(x +39/5)/2 + E*(y +6√14/5)/2 + F=0.

Substituting D=-10, E=(-5√14)/28, F=0.

So,

(39/5)x + (6√14/5)y + (-10)*(x +39/5)/2 + (-5√14/28)*(y +6√14/5)/2 =0.

Let me compute each term step by step.

First, compute (39/5)x + (6√14/5)y.

Second term: (-10)*(x +39/5)/2 = (-10/2)*(x +39/5) = -5*(x + 39/5) = -5x -39.

Third term: (-5√14/28)*(y +6√14/5)/2.

Compute this:

= [ (-5√14)/28 ] * [ (y + 6√14/5) ] / 2

= [ (-5√14)/28 ] * [ y + (6√14)/5 ] / 2

= [ (-5√14)/28 * 1/2 ] * (y + (6√14)/5 )

= [ (-5√14)/56 ] * (y + (6√14)/5 )

Multiply term by term:

= (-5√14)/56 * y + (-5√14)/56 * (6√14)/5

= (-5√14 y)/56 + [ (-5√14 *6√14 )/(56*5) ]

Simplify the second term:

(-5√14 *6√14 ) = (-30)*(14) = -420

Denominator: 56*5=280

So, second term: (-420)/280 = (-3)/2.

So, the third term overall is (-5√14 y)/56 - 3/2.

Putting all terms together:

First term: (39/5)x + (6√14/5)y

Second term: -5x -39

Third term: (-5√14 y)/56 - 3/2

So, combine all:

(39/5)x + (6√14/5)y -5x -39 + (-5√14 y)/56 - 3/2 =0.

Let me combine like terms.

x terms: (39/5)x -5x = (39/5 -25/5)x = (14/5)x.

y terms: (6√14/5)y - (5√14/56)y.

Convert to common denominator, which is 280:

6√14/5 = (6√14 *56)/280 = (336√14)/280.

5√14/56 = (5√14 *5)/280 = (25√14)/280.

So,

(6√14/5 -5√14/56)y = (336√14 -25√14)/280 y = (311√14)/280 y.

Constant terms: -39 - 3/2 = (-78/2 - 3/2) = (-81)/2.

So, putting it all together:

(14/5)x + (311√14/280)y -81/2 =0.

Multiply through by 280 to eliminate denominators:

14/5 x *280 = 14*56 x = 784x.

311√14/280 y *280 = 311√14 y.

-81/2 *280 = -81*140 = -11340.

So, equation:

784x + 311√14 y -11340=0.

Is that correct? Hmm, that seems a bit messy, but perhaps okay.

So, we have two tangent lines:

Tangent at C: 56x +√14 y =0.

Tangent at B: 784x +311√14 y =11340.

Wait, but let me check my calculations again because the numbers are quite large, and I might have made an error.

Wait, when I computed the third term, I think I messed up the signs. Let me re-examine that.

Wait, in the third term, I had:

(-5√14/28)*(y +6√14/5)/2.

So, that's (-5√14/28)*(y +6√14/5)/2.

Which is [ (-5√14)/28 ] * [ y + (6√14)/5 ] /2.

Which is [ (-5√14)/(56) ] * [ y + (6√14)/5 ].

So, expanding:

= [ (-5√14)/56 ] * y + [ (-5√14)/56 ] * (6√14)/5.

So, first part: (-5√14 y)/56.

Second part: [ (-5√14 *6√14 ) ] / (56*5).

Compute numerator: (-5*6)*(√14 *√14 )= (-30)*14= -420.

Denominator: 56*5=280.

So, second part: (-420)/280= -3/2.

So, the third term is (-5√14 y)/56 -3/2.

So, yes, that seems correct.

So, the equation becomes:

(39/5)x + (6√14/5)y -5x -39 + (-5√14 y)/56 - 3/2=0.

So, yes, as above.

So, combining terms:

x terms: (39/5 -5)x = (39/5 -25/5)=14/5 x.

y terms: 6√14/5 y -5√14/56 y = [ (6√14 *56 -5√14 *5 ) / (5*56) ] y.

Compute numerator: 6*56=336, 5*5=25. So, 336√14 -25√14 = 311√14.

Denominator: 5*56=280.

So, y terms: 311√14 y / 280.

Constants: -39 -3/2 = -81/2.

So, equation: (14/5)x + (311√14/280)y -81/2 = 0.

Multiplying through by 280:

14/5 x *280 =14*56 x= 784x.

311√14 y * (280/280)=311√14 y.

-81/2 *280= -81*140= -11340.

So, 784x +311√14 y -11340=0.

So, the tangent at B is 784x +311√14 y=11340.

Now, to find point D, we need to find the intersection of the two tangents: tangent at B and tangent at C.

Tangent at C: 56x +√14 y=0 → √14 y = -56x → y= (-56/√14)x.

Simplify (-56/√14):

56/√14= (56√14)/14=4√14.

So, y= -4√14 x.

So, equation of tangent at C: y= -4√14 x.

Now, substitute this into tangent at B's equation.

So, 784x +311√14 y=11340.

Substitute y= -4√14 x:

784x +311√14*(-4√14 x)=11340.

Compute 311√14*(-4√14):

=311*(-4)*(√14)^2

= -1244*14

= -17416.

So,

784x -17416x =11340.

Combine like terms:

(784 -17416)x=11340.

Compute 784-17416= -16632.

So,

-16632x=11340.

Solve for x:

x=11340 / (-16632)= -11340 / 16632.

Simplify the fraction.

Divide numerator and denominator by 12:

11340 ÷12=945, 16632 ÷12=1386.

So, 945 /1386.

Divide numerator and denominator by 3:

945 ÷3=315, 1386 ÷3=462.

315 /462.

Divide numerator and denominator by 21:

315 ÷21=15, 462 ÷21=22.

So, x= -15/22.

So, x= -15/22.

Then, y= -4√14 x= -4√14*(-15/22)= (60√14)/22= (30√14)/11.

So, point D has coordinates (-15/22, 30√14/11).

So, D is at (-15/22, 30√14/11).

Now, we need to find point P, which is the intersection of AD with ω.

First, find parametric equation of line AD.

Point A is at (10,0), point D is at (-15/22,30√14/11).

So, the vector from A to D is (-15/22 -10, 30√14/11 -0)= (- (15/22 +220/22), 30√14/11)= (-235/22, 30√14/11).

Parametric equations:

x =10 + (-235/22)t.

y=0 + (30√14/11)t.

We can write this as:

x =10 - (235/22)t.

y= (30√14/11)t.

We need to find where this line intersects circle ω again (other than A). So, plug x and y into the circle equation.

Circle equation: x² + y² -10x - (5√14/28)y =0.

Substitute x and y:

[10 - (235/22)t]^2 + [ (30√14/11 t) ]^2 -10[10 - (235/22)t] - (5√14/28)(30√14/11 t) =0.

Let me compute each term step by step.

First term: [10 - (235/22)t]^2.

= 10² - 2*10*(235/22)t + (235/22)^2 t².

= 100 - (4700/22)t + (55225/484)t².

Simplify: 100 - (2350/11)t + (55225/484)t².

Second term: [ (30√14/11 t) ]^2.

= (900*14)/121 t².

= 12600/121 t².

Third term: -10[10 - (235/22)t]

= -100 + (2350/22)t.

Fourth term: - (5√14/28)(30√14/11 t)

= - [5*30*(√14)^2/(28*11)]t.

= - [150*14/(308)]t.

Simplify numerator: 150*14=2100.

Denominator: 308=4*77=4*7*11.

Simplify 2100/308: divide numerator and denominator by 28: 2100 ÷28=75, 308 ÷28=11.

So, 75/11.

Thus, fourth term: - (75/11) t.

Now, put all terms together:

First term: 100 - (2350/11)t + (55225/484)t².

Second term: +12600/121 t².

Third term: -100 + (2350/22)t.

Fourth term: - (75/11)t.

So, combine all:

Constant terms: 100 -100=0.

t terms: [ -2350/11 +2350/22 -75/11 ] t.

Compute:

Convert to common denominator 22.

-2350/11= -4700/22.

2350/22=2350/22.

-75/11= -150/22.

So,

t terms: [ (-4700 +2350 -150)/22 ] t = (-2500)/22 t = (-1250)/11 t.

Quadratic terms: (55225/484 +12600/121 )t².

Compute:

Convert 12600/121 to 484 denominator: 12600/121 = (12600*4)/(121*4)=50400/484.

So,

55225/484 +50400/484= (55225+50400)/484=105625/484.

Thus, quadratic terms: 105625/484 t².

So, the equation becomes:

(105625/484) t² - (1250/11) t =0.

Factor out t:

t [ (105625/484) t - (1250/11) ]=0.

So, solutions are t=0 and t= (1250/11)/(105625/484).

Simplify t:

t= (1250/11) * (484/105625).

Simplify fractions:

1250 and 105625: 105625 ÷1250=84.5. Wait, 1250*84=105,000, 1250*84.5=105,625.

So, 1250/105625= 1/84.5=2/169.

Wait, 1250*84.5=105625.

Wait, 84.5= 169/2.

So, 1250/105625 = (1250)/(1250*84.5)=1/84.5=2/169.

So,

t= (2/169) *484/11.

Compute 484/11=44.

So,

t= (2/169)*44= 88/169.

So, t=88/169.

So, the other intersection point P is at t=88/169.

So, coordinates of P:

x =10 - (235/22)*(88/169).

y= (30√14/11)*(88/169).

Compute x:

235/22 *88/169.

Simplify 88/22=4.

So,

235 *4 /169=940/169.

So,

x=10 -940/169= (1690 -940)/169=750/169.

Similarly, y= (30√14/11)*(88/169).

Simplify 88/11=8.

So,

30√14 *8 /169=240√14 /169.

So, point P is at (750/169, 240√14/169).

Now, we need to find AP.

Point A is at (10,0), point P is at (750/169, 240√14/169).

Compute distance AP.

Use distance formula:

AP= sqrt[ (750/169 -10)^2 + (240√14/169 -0)^2 ].

Compute 750/169 -10=750/169 -1690/169= (-940)/169.

240√14/169 remains as is.

So,

AP= sqrt[ ( (-940/169)^2 ) + (240√14/169)^2 ]

= sqrt[ (940² + (240√14)^2 ) /169² ]

Compute numerator:

940²= (900+40)^2=900² +2*900*40 +40²=810000 +72000 +1600=883600.

(240√14)^2=240² *14=57600*14=806400.

So, numerator=883600 +806400=1,690,000.

So,

AP= sqrt(1,690,000 /169² )= sqrt(1,690,000)/169.

Wait, sqrt(1,690,000)=sqrt(169*10,000)=13*100=1300.

So,

AP=1300 /169.

Simplify 1300/169: 169*7=1183, 169*7.69... Wait, 169*7=1183, 169*7.69=1300?

Wait, 169*7=1183, 169*7.69= approx 169*7 +169*0.69≈1183+116≈1299. Close, but perhaps exact fraction.

Wait, 169 is 13², and 1300=13*100.

So, 1300=13*100=13*10².

So, 1300/169= (13*100)/(13²)=100/13.

So, AP=100/13.

Therefore, m=100, n=13, which are coprime.

Thus, m +n=113.


To solve the problem, we start by noting that point \( D \) is the intersection of the tangents to the circumcircle \( \omega \) of triangle \( ABC \) at points \( B \) and \( C \). By the property of tangents, \( BD = CD \). We use the Power of a Point theorem, which states that \( DB^2 = DP \cdot DA \), where \( P \) is the second intersection point of line \( AD \) with \( \omega \).

First, we compute the circumradius \( R \) of triangle \( ABC \) using the Law of Cosines. Given \( AB = 5 \), \( BC = 9 \), and \( AC = 10 \), we find \( \cos \angle BAC = \frac{11}{25} \). Using this, we determine the circumradius \( R = \frac{abc}{4K} \), where \( K \) is the area of the triangle. The area \( K \) is calculated using Heron's formula, giving \( R = \frac{65}{8} \).

Next, we find the length of \( BD \) using the Law of Cosines in triangle \( BDC \). Since \( BD = CD \) and \( \angle BDC = 180^\circ - 2\theta \) (where \( \theta = \angle BAC \)), we solve for \( BD \) and find \( BD = \frac{225}{22} \).

Using coordinates, we place \( C \) at the origin and \( A \) at \( (10, 0) \). We compute the coordinates of \( B \) as \( \left( \frac{39}{5}, \frac{6\sqrt{14}}{5} \right) \). We then find the equations of the tangents at \( B \) and \( C \), and solve for the coordinates of \( D \) as \( \left( -\frac{15}{22}, \frac{30\sqrt{14}}{11} \right) \).

We parametrize line \( AD \) and find its intersection with \( \omega \) again at point \( P \). Using the parametric equations and solving for the intersection, we determine the coordinates of \( P \) as \( \left( \frac{750}{169}, \frac{240\sqrt{14}}{169} \right) \).

Finally, we compute the distance \( AP \) using the distance formula. After simplifying, we find \( AP = \frac{100}{13} \). Thus, \( m = 100 \) and \( n = 13 \), leading to \( m + n = 113 \).

\boxed{113}
