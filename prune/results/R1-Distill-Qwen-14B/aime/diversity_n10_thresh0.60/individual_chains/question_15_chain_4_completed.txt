Okay, so I've got this problem about counting paths on an 8x8 grid. The paths are from the lower left corner to the upper right corner, and they need to have a length of 16. Hmm, wait, an 8x8 grid usually has 9 points along each side, right? Because if you have 8 squares, you need 9 points to form them. So, moving from one corner to the opposite would involve moving 8 steps right and 8 steps up, totaling 16 steps. That makes sense since the problem mentions paths of length 16.

The problem is asking for the number of such paths that change direction exactly four times. So, each path is made up of a series of moves either to the right or upwards, but whenever it changes direction, that's a turn. For example, going right, right, up, up, right, etc., each time the direction switches, it's a change. So, exactly four such changes are allowed in the path.

Let me think about how to model this. So, in a path from (0,0) to (8,8), each step is either right (R) or up (U). Each path is a sequence of R's and U's with 8 of each. The total number of such paths without any restrictions is the combination C(16,8), which is 12870. But we need only those paths that change direction exactly four times.

Wait, changing direction four times... So, how does that translate into the number of runs? A run is a consecutive sequence of the same direction. Each change of direction starts a new run. So, if a path changes direction four times, that would mean it has five runs. Because each change starts a new run, so starting with the first run, each change adds another run. So, four changes lead to five runs.

So, for example, a path that goes R, R, U, U, R, U, U, U, R, R, R, U, U, R, U, U would have multiple changes. Wait, actually, let me count. Starting with R, then U — that's one change. Then R again — that's two. Then U again — that's three. Then R again — four changes, making five runs. Wait, but in this example, I might have more changes. Hmm, maybe I should think of it as the number of runs.

So, if a path changes direction four times, it has five runs. Each run is either all R's or all U's. Now, the runs can start with either R or U, right? So, the first run could be R or U, then each subsequent run alternates direction.

So, maybe we can model this by considering the number of ways to arrange the runs. Since we have five runs, and each run alternates direction. So, the first run could be R, then U, then R, then U, then R — that's five runs with four changes. Alternatively, the first run could be U, then R, U, R, U — also five runs with four changes. So, there are two possibilities for the starting direction.

But wait, the total number of R's and U's must each be 8. So, the sum of R runs must be 8, and the sum of U runs must be 8. Each run is at least length 1, since a run can't have zero steps. So, we can model this as a stars and bars problem.

Let me think. If I have k runs of R's and l runs of U's, and the total number of direction changes is (k + l - 2), because each time you switch from R to U or U to R, that's a change. Wait, no, actually, the number of direction changes is equal to (number of runs - 1). Because each time you start a new run, that's a change. So, if you have five runs, that's four changes. So, the number of runs is four plus one, which is five.

Wait, so for the direction changes, if the path starts with R, then the runs would be R, U, R, U, R. So, there are three R runs and two U runs. Alternatively, if it starts with U, the runs would be U, R, U, R, U, which is three U runs and two R runs.

So, in either case, for five runs, whether starting with R or U, the number of R runs is either three or two, and U runs is either two or three. Wait, let me get that right.

If the path starts with R, then the runs are R, U, R, U, R. So, number of R runs is 3, U runs is 2. Similarly, if it starts with U, runs are U, R, U, R, U. So, number of U runs is 3, R runs is 2.

So, in both cases, the number of runs of each direction is either 3 and 2 or 2 and 3.

So, in general, for five runs, starting with R, we have 3 R runs and 2 U runs. Starting with U, we have 3 U runs and 2 R runs.

Now, the total number of R steps is 8, which must be distributed among the R runs, each run having at least 1 step. Similarly for U steps.

So, for the case where the path starts with R, we have three R runs and two U runs. Each R run must have at least 1 R, and each U run must have at least 1 U.

So, the number of ways to distribute the R steps is the number of positive integer solutions to a + b + c = 8, where a, b, c are the lengths of the R runs. Similarly, for U steps, it's the number of positive integer solutions to d + e = 8.

The number of solutions is C(8-1, 3-1) for R runs, which is C(7,2) = 21. Similarly, for U runs, it's C(8-1, 2-1) = C(7,1) =7.

Therefore, the number of such paths starting with R is 21*7 = 147.

Similarly, for the case starting with U, we have three U runs and two R runs. The number of ways for U runs is C(7,2) =21, and for R runs is C(7,1)=7. So, again, 21*7=147.

Therefore, the total number of paths with exactly four direction changes (i.e., five runs) is 147 + 147 = 294.

Wait, that seems straightforward. But let me make sure I didn't miss anything.

So, each direction change corresponds to a run, which is a consecutive sequence of same-direction steps. So, for four changes, five runs. The starting direction can be R or U, which gives two cases. For each case, the number of R runs and U runs are 3 and 2, or 2 and 3. Then, the number of ways to split the 8 R's into 3 runs is C(7,2), which is 21, and 8 U's into 2 runs is C(7,1)=7, so 21*7=147 per case.

Therefore, adding both starting directions gives 294.

But wait, is there another way to compute this? Maybe using the formula for the number of paths with a given number of runs.

I remember that the number of lattice paths from (0,0) to (m,n) with exactly k runs is given by something like 2*C(m-1, r-1)*C(n-1, s-1), where r and s are the number of runs for each direction? Hmm, not exactly sure. Alternatively, perhaps using the formula for the number of compositions.

Wait, a composition of an integer is a way of writing it as the sum of positive integers. So, the number of compositions of 8 into 3 parts is C(7,2)=21, which matches what I had earlier.

So, the formula seems correct.

Alternatively, perhaps generalizing, the number of paths with exactly t direction changes is 2*C(a-1, k-1)*C(b-1, l-1), where a and b are the number of steps in each direction, and k and l are the number of runs for each direction.

Wait, but in our case, the total number of runs is five, so either 3 R runs and 2 U runs, or 2 R runs and 3 U runs.

So, yes, for each starting direction, it's C(8-1, 3-1)*C(8-1, 2-1) = C(7,2)*C(7,1)=21*7=147. So, two possibilities, so 294.

Therefore, the answer should be 294.

But wait, let me think again. Is there a possibility that the starting direction is fixed? Or does it matter? Let me think. For example, the first step is either R or U, so the starting direction can be either, so both cases should be considered.

Alternatively, perhaps we can model this using dynamic programming or recursion, but that might complicate things more. Alternatively, perhaps using generating functions.

Wait, but maybe I should think about another approach. The number of paths with exactly four direction changes is equal to the number of paths with exactly five runs.

Each run can be of R or U, starting with either R or U, and then alternates.

So, the number of such paths is the number of ways to start with R, have five runs (three R, two U), plus starting with U, have five runs (three U, two R).

Which is exactly what I computed earlier.

Wait, but another way to think about it: when you have five runs, the number of possible ways is 2*(number of compositions of 8 into 3 parts)*(number of compositions of 8 into 2 parts).

Which is 2*(C(7,2))*(C(7,1))=2*21*7=294.

Hmm, seems consistent.

Alternatively, perhaps another formula: The number of monotonic paths with exactly r runs is 2*C(n-1, r/2 -1)*C(m-1, r/2 -1), but I'm not sure about the exact formula.

Wait, perhaps I can refer to the formula for the number of Dyck paths or something similar, but in this case, it's not necessarily balanced. So, maybe that's not directly applicable.

Alternatively, perhaps I can think of the number of such paths as the number of ways to interleave the runs.

Wait, so once I have the lengths of R runs and U runs, the number of ways to arrange them is determined by the starting direction.

For example, if starting with R, the order is R, U, R, U, R. So, the specific lengths of each run determine the path.

So, the number of such paths is the product of the number of compositions for R and U runs, multiplied by the number of possible interleavings, which in this case is fixed once the starting direction is chosen.

So, it's 2*(C(7,2)*C(7,1))=294.

I think that's solid.

Therefore, the final answer should be 294.


The problem involves counting paths of length 16 from the lower left to the upper right corner of an 8×8 grid, which change direction exactly four times. Each path consists of 8 right (R) and 8 up (U) moves. Changing direction four times corresponds to having five runs (consecutive sequences of R or U). 

For a path starting with R, there are three R runs and two U runs. The number of ways to distribute the 8 R's into 3 runs is given by the number of compositions of 8 into 3 parts, which is \( \binom{7}{2} = 21 \). Similarly, the number of ways to distribute the 8 U's into 2 runs is \( \binom{7}{1} = 7 \). Thus, the number of paths starting with R is \( 21 \times 7 = 147 \).

Similarly, for a path starting with U, there are three U runs and two R runs. The number of compositions is the same, leading to another \( 147 \) paths.

Adding both cases, the total number of paths is \( 147 + 147 = 294 \).

\boxed{294}
