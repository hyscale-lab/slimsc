Okay, so I've got this math problem here, and I'm going to try to figure it out step by step. The problem is: Find the largest possible real part of [(75 + 117i)z + (96 + 144i)/z], where z is a complex number with |z| = 4. Hmm, that seems a bit involved, but let's try to unpack it.

First off, I know that z is a complex number, and its magnitude is 4. So, |z| = 4. That means if I write z in polar form, it would be z = 4e^{iθ}, where θ is the argument of z. Alternatively, I could write z as 4(cosθ + i sinθ). Maybe that's useful later.

The expression we're dealing with is (75 + 117i)z + (96 + 144i)/z. Let me denote this expression as E. So, E = (75 + 117i)z + (96 + 144i)/z.

Since we need to find the largest possible real part of E, Re(E), maybe I should express E in terms of real and imaginary parts, and then maximize the real part.

But before that, perhaps I can manipulate E a bit more. Let me see:

E = (75 + 117i)z + (96 + 144i)/z

Given that |z| = 4, so |1/z| = 1/4. So, 1/z is the conjugate of z divided by |z|². Wait, no, actually, for a complex number z, 1/z is equal to (conj(z))/|z|². Since |z| is 4, |z|² is 16. So, 1/z = (conj(z))/16.

So, substituting that into E:

E = (75 + 117i)z + (96 + 144i) * (conj(z)/16)

Hmm, that's interesting. So, E is now expressed in terms of z and its conjugate. Maybe I can write this as a combination of z and conj(z), which could help in expressing Re(E).

Wait, but perhaps it's easier to write z as 4e^{iθ}, as I thought earlier. Let's try that. So, z = 4e^{iθ}, which means conj(z) = 4e^{-iθ}.

So, substituting into E:

E = (75 + 117i)(4e^{iθ}) + (96 + 144i)(4e^{-iθ}/16)

Simplify each term:

First term: (75 + 117i)(4e^{iθ}) = 4(75 + 117i)e^{iθ}

Second term: (96 + 144i)(4e^{-iθ}/16) = (96 + 144i)*(e^{-iθ}/4) = (96 + 144i)/4 * e^{-iθ} = (24 + 36i)e^{-iθ}

So, E = 4(75 + 117i)e^{iθ} + (24 + 36i)e^{-iθ}

Hmm, okay. Let me compute 4*(75 + 117i) first. That would be 300 + 468i. So, E = (300 + 468i)e^{iθ} + (24 + 36i)e^{-iθ}

Now, I can expand E into its real and imaginary parts. Let's write e^{iθ} as cosθ + i sinθ, and e^{-iθ} as cosθ - i sinθ.

So, expanding:

First term: (300 + 468i)(cosθ + i sinθ)
= 300 cosθ + 300i sinθ + 468i cosθ + 468i^2 sinθ
= 300 cosθ + (300 sinθ + 468 cosθ)i - 468 sinθ

Second term: (24 + 36i)(cosθ - i sinθ)
= 24 cosθ - 24i sinθ + 36i cosθ - 36i^2 sinθ
= 24 cosθ + (36 cosθ - 24 sinθ)i + 36 sinθ

So, adding these two terms together:

Real parts:
300 cosθ - 468 sinθ + 24 cosθ + 36 sinθ
= (300 + 24) cosθ + (-468 + 36) sinθ
= 324 cosθ - 432 sinθ

Imaginary parts:
(300 sinθ + 468 cosθ) + (36 cosθ - 24 sinθ)
= (300 sinθ - 24 sinθ) + (468 cosθ + 36 cosθ)
= 276 sinθ + 504 cosθ

So, E has real part Re(E) = 324 cosθ - 432 sinθ, and imaginary part Im(E) = 276 sinθ + 504 cosθ.

But since we're only interested in Re(E), let's focus on that: Re(E) = 324 cosθ - 432 sinθ.

We need to find the maximum value of Re(E) as θ varies.

Hmm. So, Re(E) is a function of θ, and it's of the form A cosθ + B sinθ, but in this case, it's 324 cosθ - 432 sinθ.

Wait, more accurately, it can be written as C cos(θ + φ), where C is the amplitude. The maximum value of such an expression is C, since the maximum of cos is 1.

So, let's compute C = sqrt(A² + B
