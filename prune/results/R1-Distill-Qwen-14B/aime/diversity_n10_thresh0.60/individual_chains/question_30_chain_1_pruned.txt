Alright, so I've got this math problem here, and I need to find the remainder when the product from k=0 to 12 of (2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k}) is divided by 1000, where ω is a 13th root of unity and not equal to 1. Hmm, okay, let me think about how to approach this.

First, I remember that roots of unity have some nice properties, especially when dealing with polynomials. Since ω is a primitive 13th root of unity, it must satisfy ω^13 = 1, and all its powers from 0 to 12 are distinct. So, ω^k for k=0,1,...,12 are all the 13th roots of unity.

The problem is asking for the product of terms (2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k}) for each k from 0 to 12. That seems like a lot of terms, but maybe there's a pattern or a simplification I can use.

Let me write down the product:

P = ∏_{k=0}^{12} (2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k})

I wonder if I can factor this expression somehow or relate it to a known polynomial. Since ω is a root of unity, perhaps using cyclotomic polynomials could help. The cyclotomic polynomial Φ_n(x) is the minimal polynomial whose roots are the primitive nth roots of unity. But I'm not sure if that's directly applicable here.

Wait, another idea: maybe each term can be rewritten in terms of ω^k. Let me let x = ω^k. Then the term becomes 2 - 2x + x^2. So, each factor is a quadratic in x. So, for each x, which is a 13th root of unity, we have the quadratic 2 - 2x + x^2.

So the product P is the product over all x (where x^13 = 1) of (x^2 - 2x + 2). But wait, is that true? Because when k=0, ω^0=1, so the term is 2 - 2*1 + 1 = 2 - 2 + 1 = 1. So that term is 1, which doesn't affect the product. So, actually, the product simplifies to the product over k=1 to 12 of (2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k}), because when k=0, it's 1.

So, P = ∏_{k=1}^{12} (x^2 - 2x + 2) where x = ω^k.

But wait, since ω^k are all the primitive 13th roots except 1, perhaps I can relate this product to evaluating a certain polynomial at specific points.

I recall that for a polynomial f(x), the product of (x - a_i) where a_i are the roots is f(x). So, if I can find a polynomial whose roots are the x = ω^k
