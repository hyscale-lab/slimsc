Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the number of rectangles that can be formed inside a regular dodecagon. Each side of the rectangle has to lie either on a side or a diagonal of the dodecagon. Hmm, interesting.

First, let me visualize a regular dodecagon. It's a 12-sided polygon with all sides equal and all internal angles equal. Each internal angle in a regular dodecagon is 150 degrees, right? Because the formula for internal angles is ((n-2)*180)/n, so here that's (10*180)/12 = 150 degrees.

Now, the problem is about rectangles. So, a rectangle has opposite sides equal and all angles 90 degrees. In the dodecagon, sides and diagonals can form such rectangles. I need to figure out how many such rectangles exist.

I remember that in regular polygons, especially those with a high number of sides like a dodecagon, you can form various shapes by connecting vertices. For rectangles, it's about selecting pairs of vertices that are aligned in such a way that their connecting lines are perpendicular and form the sides of a rectangle.

Wait, but in a regular polygon, are all the necessary lines (sides and diagonals) present to form rectangles? I think so. For a rectangle, we need two sets of parallel lines, each set perpendicular to the other. So, in the dodecagon, I need to find pairs of parallel lines that are perpendicular to another pair.

But how do I systematically count all such rectangles? Maybe I should think about the symmetry of the dodecagon. Since it's regular, it has a lot of symmetry, which can help.

Let me consider the dodecagon inscribed in a circle. Each vertex can be thought of as a point on the circumference, separated by 30 degrees (since 360/12 = 30). So, the central angle between two adjacent vertices is 30 degrees.

Now, in a circle, two chords (which are the sides and diagonals of the dodecagon) are parallel if the arcs they subtend are equal. So, for two chords to be parallel, the number of sides they skip must be the same. For example, a side skips 0 vertices, a diagonal that skips 1 vertex skips one, another skips two, etc.

Wait, but actually, in a regular polygon, the number of sides you "step over" when drawing a diagonal determines the length of the diagonal. So, in a dodecagon, the diagonals can be categorized based on how many vertices they skip.

So, for the dodecagon, sides are the 1-step diagonals (they connect adjacent vertices), then diagonals can skip 2, 3, ..., up to 5 vertices because beyond that, the diagonals start repeating in the opposite direction. For example, skipping 6 vertices in a dodecagon brings you back to the same point on the opposite side, but that's a diameter.

Wait, no, in a 12-gon, skipping 6 vertices is a straight line through the center, which is a diameter. So, the diagonals can be grouped based on how many steps they skip, from 1 to 5, and then 6 is the diameter.

So, for each possible step count (1 to 6), there's a corresponding set of parallel lines. But wait, step counts beyond 6 would just mirror those below 6, right? So, step 7 is equivalent to step 5 in the opposite direction, etc.

So, for each step size from 1 to 6, there are lines that are parallel. Now, to form a rectangle, I think we need two pairs of these lines, each pair being parallel, and the two pairs being perpendicular to each other.

Wait, but I need to check if those lines are actually perpendicular. In a regular dodecagon, are the diagonals with step sizes that correspond to perpendicular directions?

Hmm, let's think about the angles between different step sizes. The central angle between two vertices is 30 degrees. So, if I have a diagonal that skips k vertices, the central angle it subtends is k
