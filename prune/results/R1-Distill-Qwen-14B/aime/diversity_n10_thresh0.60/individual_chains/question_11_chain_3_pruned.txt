Okay, so I have this problem here: I need to find the largest possible real part of the expression (75 + 117i)z + (96 + 144i)/z, where z is a complex number with |z| = 4. Hmm, let's see. I remember that when dealing with complex numbers and their moduli, sometimes expressing them in polar form can be helpful. 

First, since |z| = 4, I can write z as 4e^{iθ}, where θ is the argument of z. That should make things easier because then 1/z would be (1/4)e^{-iθ}, right? Because the modulus of 1/z is 1/|z|, and the argument is the negative of the argument of z.

So substituting z = 4e^{iθ}, let's rewrite the expression:

(75 + 117i) * 4e^{iθ} + (96 + 144i) * (1/(4e^{iθ})).

Let me compute each term separately. 

First term: (75 + 117i) * 4e^{iθ} = 4*(75 + 117i)*e^{iθ}.

Second term: (96 + 144i) * (1/(4e^{iθ})) = (96 + 144i)/4 * e^{-iθ} = (24 + 36i) * e^{-iθ}.

So the entire expression becomes:

4*(75 + 117i)*e^{iθ} + (24 + 36i)*e^{-iθ}.

Now, let me express these complex numbers in polar form. Wait, but 75 + 117i and 24 + 36i might have some relationships. Let me check the ratio of their real and imaginary parts. 

For 75 + 117i: The real part is 75, imaginary part is 117. Let's see if 75/117 simplifies. 75 and 117 are both divisible by 3: 75 ÷ 3 = 25, 117 ÷3 = 39. So 25/39. Hmm, maybe not a standard angle. Let me compute their magnitudes. |75 + 117i| = sqrt(75² + 117²). Let's compute that:

75² = 5625, 117² = 13689. So sum is 5625 + 13689 = 19314. sqrt(19314) is approximately 139. So, but maybe it's an exact value? Let me see: 139² is 19321, which is a bit higher than 19314. So it's about 139. So, maybe not a nice number. Hmm.

Similarly, for 24 + 36i: The real part is 24, imaginary part 36. 24/36 = 2/3, which is 0.666... That's a known ratio, like 30-60-90 triangles, but not exactly. Wait, 24 and 36: both divisible by 12. 24 ÷12=2, 36 ÷12=3. So the ratio is 2:3, which corresponds to an angle of arctan(3/2) ≈ 56.31 degrees. But again, not a standard angle.

Alternatively, maybe I can factor out some common terms. Let's see: 75 + 117i. Let me see if 3 is a common factor: 75 ÷3=25, 117 ÷3=39. So 75 + 117i = 3*(25 + 39i). Similarly, 24 + 36i = 12*(2 + 3i). Hmm, not sure if that helps, but maybe.

Alternatively, perhaps I can write both complex numbers multiplied by z and 1/z in terms of their polar forms. Let me think.

Wait, since z = 4e^{iθ}, then e^{iθ} = z/4, and e^{-iθ} = 4/z. So perhaps expressing the whole expression in terms of z and 1/z.

But let me proceed step by step. Let me denote A = 75 + 117i, B = 24 + 36i. Then the expression is 4A e^{iθ} + B e^{-iθ}.

Expressed as 4A e^{iθ} + B e^{-iθ}.

So, if I can write this as a single exponential function or combine terms somehow. Alternatively, perhaps I can express the entire expression in terms of cosine and sine using Euler's formula.

Euler's formula says that e^{iθ} = cosθ + i sinθ, so:

4A e^{iθ} = 4A (cosθ + i sinθ) = 4A cosθ + 4i A sinθ.

Similarly, B e^{-iθ} = B (cosθ
