Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the number of triples of nonnegative integers (a, b, c) such that a + b + c = 300 and a²b + a²c + b²a + b²c + c²a + c²b = 6,000,000. Hmm, that looks a bit complicated, but maybe I can break it down.

First, I know that a, b, c are nonnegative integers, so they can be 0 or any positive integer. The first equation is straightforward: the sum of a, b, and c is 300. The second equation is a bit more involved. Let me see if I can factor or simplify it somehow.

Looking at the second equation: a²b + a²c + b²a + b²c + c²a + c²b. I notice that each term is a product where one variable is squared and multiplied by another. Maybe I can factor this expression. Let me try to group terms:

a²(b + c) + b²(a + c) + c²(a + b). That seems a bit better. So, since a + b + c = 300, maybe I can substitute that in. For example, b + c = 300 - a, right? Similarly, a + c = 300 - b, and a + b = 300 - c.

So substituting these into the expression, I get:

a²(300 - a) + b²(300 - b) + c²(300 - c) = 6,000,000.

Hmm, so that's 300a² - a³ + 300b² - b³ + 300c² - c³ = 6,000,000.

Wait, so combining terms, that's 300(a² + b² + c²) - (a³ + b³ + c³) = 6,000,000.

Hmm, I wonder if there's a way to relate a² + b² + c² and a³ + b³ + c³ to the sum a + b + c. Maybe using some algebraic identities?

I remember that (a + b + c)² = a² + b² + c² + 2(ab + ac + bc). So, since a + b + c = 300, then 300² = a² + b² + c² + 2(ab + ac + bc). That gives a² + b² + c² = 300² - 2(ab + ac + bc). Let me compute 300²: that's 90,000. So a² + b² + c² = 90,000 - 2(ab + ac + bc).

Similarly, I wonder about a³ + b³ + c³. There's an identity for that too. I think it's a³ + b³ + c³ = (a + b + c)³ - 3(a + b + c)(ab + ac + bc) + 3abc. Let me check: yes, that looks right. So substituting a + b + c = 300, that becomes 300³ - 3*300*(ab + ac + bc) + 3abc.

So now, let me try to express the expression 300(a² + b² + c²) - (a³ + b³ + c³) in terms of ab + ac + bc and abc.

Substituting a² + b² + c² = 90,000 - 2(ab + ac + bc), we get:

300*(90,000 - 2(ab + ac + bc)) - [300³ - 3*300*(ab + ac + bc) + 3abc] = 6,000,000.

Let me compute each part step by step.

First, 300*(90,000) = 27,000,000. Then, 300*(-2(ab + ac + bc)) = -600(ab + ac + bc).

So, 300(a² + b² + c²) = 27,000,000 - 600(ab + ac + bc).

Now, the second part is - (a³ + b³ + c³), which is - [300³ - 3*300*(ab + ac + bc) + 3abc]. Let me compute that.

300³ is 27,000,000. So, a³ + b³ + c³ = 27,000,000 - 900(ab + ac + bc) + 3abc.

Therefore, -(a³ + b³ + c³) = -27,000,000 + 900(ab + ac + bc) - 3abc.

Putting it all together, the entire expression becomes:

[27,000,000 - 600(ab + ac + bc)] + [-27,000,000 + 900(ab + ac + bc) - 3abc] = 6,000,000.

Let me simplify this.

27,000,000 - 27,000,000 cancels out. Then, -600(ab + ac + bc) + 900(ab + ac + bc) is 300(ab + ac + bc). So:

300(ab + ac + bc) - 3abc = 6,000,000.

Hmm, so 300(ab + ac + bc) - 3abc = 6,000,000.

I can factor out a 3:

3[100(ab + ac + bc) - abc] = 6,000,000.

Divide both sides by 3:

100(ab + ac + bc) - abc = 2,000,000.

Hmm, that's simpler. So now, the equation is 100(ab + ac + bc) - abc = 2,000,000.

Let me write that as:

abc - 100(ab + ac + bc) = -2,000,000.

Alternatively, I can write it as abc - 100ab - 100ac - 100bc = -2,000,000.

Hmm, perhaps I can factor this expression. Let me think.

Maybe adding 100³ to both sides to make it factorable. Wait, sometimes when dealing with expressions like abc - k(ab
