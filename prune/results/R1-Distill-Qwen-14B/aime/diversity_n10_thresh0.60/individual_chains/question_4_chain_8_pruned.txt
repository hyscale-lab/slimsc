Okay, so I've got this problem where Alice and Bob are playing a game with a stack of n tokens. They take turns removing either 1 or 4 tokens each time, and whoever takes the last token wins. I need to figure out, for how many positive integers n ≤ 2024 does Bob have a winning strategy, no matter how Alice plays.

Hmm, let's break this down. Since Alice goes first, Bob wants to have a strategy that forces him to win regardless of what Alice does. So, I think this is a classic game theory problem, probably involving the concept of "winning positions" and "losing positions." A winning position is one where the current player can force a win, and a losing position is one where no matter what the current player does, the opponent can force a win.

So, the key is to determine for each n whether it's a winning or losing position. If a position is a losing position, then the player whose turn it is will lose if the opponent plays optimally. Since Bob is the second player, if n is a losing position, then Bob can win by playing optimally.

Wait, no. Wait. Let me think again. If n is a winning position, the first player can win. If it's a losing position, the first player will lose. So, since Alice goes first, if n is a losing position, Bob can win. So we need to find all n ≤ 2024 where n is a losing position.

So, the plan is to find all n such that n is a losing position, and count them up to 2024.

How to model this? I think we can use dynamic programming. Let's define an array or something where for each number of tokens n, we determine if it's a winning (True) or losing (False) position.

The base case is when n=0. If there are 0 tokens left, the game is over, so the player who just moved wins. So, if n=0, the current player has already won. Wait, but in our setup, the players take turns removing tokens, and the one who removes the last token wins. So, if n=0, the previous player has taken the last token and thus has won. So, n=0 is a losing position for the current player because they can't make a move.

Wait, no. Wait, maybe
