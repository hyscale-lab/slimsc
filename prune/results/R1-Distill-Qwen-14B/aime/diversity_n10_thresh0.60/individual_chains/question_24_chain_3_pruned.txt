Okay, so I have this math problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again carefully.

The problem says: A list of positive integers has the following properties:
1. The sum of the items in the list is 30.
2. The unique mode of the list is 9.
3. The median of the list is a positive integer that does not appear in the list itself.

And the question is to find the sum of the squares of all the items in the list.

Hmm, okay. Let's break this down.

First, let me recall some definitions to make sure I understand the terms correctly.

- The **sum** is straightforwardâ€”it's just adding up all the numbers.
- The **mode** is the number that appears most frequently in the list. It's unique here, so only 9 can be the mode, and it must appear more times than any other number.
- The **median** is the middle number when the numbers are arranged in order. If there's an odd number of elements, it's the middle one. If even, it's the average of the two middle ones. But in this case, the median is a positive integer that doesn't appear in the list. Interesting.

So, I need to construct a list of positive integers where:
- The sum is 30.
- 9 is the unique mode.
- The median is a positive integer not present in the list.

And then, once I have that list, calculate the sum of the squares of all the items.

Let me approach this step by step.

First, since the mode is 9 and it's unique, 9 must appear more times than any other number in the list. So, how many times does 9 appear? Let's denote the number of times 9 appears as 'k'. Then, all other numbers in the list must appear at most 'k-1' times.

Also, since the median is a positive integer not present in the list, that gives me some constraints on the length of the list and the middle values.

Let me think about the possible lengths of the list. Let's denote the number of elements as 'n'. Since the median is a positive integer not present, the list can be either of even or odd length.

Wait, but if n is odd, the median is the middle element. If the median is not present, that would imply that the middle element is not in the list. But wait, in an odd-length list, the median is one of the elements. So, if the median isn't present, that can't happen. Therefore, the list must have an even number of elements.

Because for an even number of elements, the median is the average of the two middle numbers. So, the median might not be an integer unless the two middle numbers are the same. But in this case, the median is a positive integer that doesn't appear in the list. So, the median must be the average of two numbers that are not equal, but their average is an integer not in the list.

Wait, that's a bit confusing. Let me think again.

If the list has an even number of elements, say 2m, then the median is (a_m + a_{m+1}) / 2, where the list is sorted in non-decreasing order
