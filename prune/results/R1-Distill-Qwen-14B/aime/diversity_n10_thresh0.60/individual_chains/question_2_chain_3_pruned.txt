Okay, so I'm trying to solve this geometry problem. Let me read it again and make sure I understand all the parts.

We have three points: O at (0,0), A at (1/2, 0), and B at (0, sqrt(3)/2). So, O is the origin, A is halfway along the x-axis between O and (1, 0), and B is a point on the y-axis that's a bit less than 1 unit up, since sqrt(3)/2 is approximately 0.866.

Then, there's a family F of segments PQ. These are unit length segments lying in the first quadrant, with P on the x-axis and Q on the y-axis. So, each segment PQ connects a point P on the x-axis to a point Q on the y-axis, and the distance between P and Q is 1. Since all these segments are in the first quadrant, both P and Q have non-negative coordinates.

So, for example, if P is (a, 0), then Q must be such that the distance from (a, 0) to (0, b) is 1. That would mean sqrt(a² + b²) = 1, so a² + b² = 1. So, for any a between 0 and 1, P would be (a, 0) and Q would be (0, sqrt(1 - a²)).

Wait, but the segments are in the first quadrant, so a and b are non-negative. So, the family F consists of all such segments PQ where P is (a, 0) and Q is (0, sqrt(1 - a²)), with a ranging from 0 to 1.

Then, the problem says there's a unique point C on segment AB, distinct from A and B, that doesn't belong to any segment from F except AB. So, AB is one of these segments in F, right? Because A is (1/2, 0) and B is (0, sqrt(3)/2). Let's check the distance between A and B: sqrt( (1/2)^2 + (sqrt(3)/2)^2 ) = sqrt(1/4 + 3/4) = sqrt(1) = 1. So yes, AB is in F.

So, all the other points on AB are not on any other segment from F except AB. But there's a unique point C on AB that doesn't lie on any other segment from F. So, we need to find this point C, and then compute OC², which is the square of the distance from the origin to point C.

Once we have OC² as a fraction p/q, we have to find p + q where p and q are coprime.

Alright, so how do I approach this?

First, I think I need to parametrize point C on AB. Since A is (1/2, 0) and B is (0, sqrt(3)/2), the line AB can be parametrized. Let me find the equation of line AB.

The slope of AB is (sqrt(3)/2 - 0)/(0 - 1/2) = (sqrt(3)/2) / (-1/2) = -sqrt(3). So, the equation of line AB is y = -sqrt(3)x + b. Since it passes through A (1/2, 0), plug in x = 1/2, y = 0: 0 = -sqrt(3)*(1/2) + b => b = sqrt(3)/2. So, the equation is y = -sqrt(3)x + sqrt(3)/2.

So, any point C on AB can be written as (x, -sqrt(3)x + sqrt(3)/2), where x ranges from 0 to 1/2.

So, let me denote point C as (x, y) where y = -sqrt(3)x + sqrt(3)/2.

Now, the problem states that C is on AB, and it doesn't lie on any other segment PQ from the family F except AB itself. So, for all other segments PQ in F, C is not on PQ.

So, C is on AB, and for any other segment PQ in F, C is not on PQ.

So, for all other PQ in F, the equation of PQ does not pass through C.

Wait, but AB is one of those PQ, so for all other PQ, the lines PQ do not pass through C except for AB.

So, to find C, I need to find a point on AB such that no other segment PQ from F passes through it.

Alternatively, for each other PQ in F, the point C is not on PQ.

So, perhaps we can think of the envelope of the family F of segments PQ. The envelope is the set of points that are on exactly one segment from the family. So, the envelope would consist of points that are on some PQ in F but not on any others.

But in our case, the point C is on AB and is the only point on AB that's not on any other PQ in F. So, AB is part of the envelope, and C is the point where AB is the only PQ passing through it.

Alternatively, maybe the envelope of F is the line AB, and C is the point where AB is tangent to some curve related to F.

Wait, maybe it's better to think in terms of when a point is on multiple segments from F. So, for a point to be on two different segments PQ and P'Q' from F, certain conditions must be met.

Suppose a point (x, y) lies on two different segments PQ and P'Q'. Then, (x, y) must satisfy the equations of both PQ and P'Q'.

Each PQ is a line segment between (a, 0) and (0, b), where a² + b² = 1.

So, the equation of PQ is (x/a) + (y/b) = 1, right? Because the intercept form of a line is x/a + y/b = 1, where a and b are the x-intercept and y-intercept.

So, for a point (x, y) on PQ, it satisfies x/a + y/b = 1.

So, if (x, y) is on two different segments PQ and P'Q', then it must satisfy two equations:

x/a + y/b = 1,

x/a' + y/b' = 1,

where (a, b) and (a', b') are different pairs satisfying a² + b² = 1 and a'² + b'² = 1.

So, to find points that lie on exactly one such line, we can find the envelope of these lines.

The envelope of a family of curves is a curve that is tangent to each member of the family at some point. So, in this case, the envelope would be a curve such that each line PQ from F is tangent to it at exactly one point.

So, the envelope will be a curve where for each PQ in F, the line PQ is tangent to the envelope at some point, and points on the envelope are on exactly one PQ.

So, the point C is on AB and is the only point on AB that is also on the envelope. So, perhaps C is the point where AB is tangent to the envelope of F.

Alternatively, perhaps the envelope is a circle or some other conic section, and AB is tangent to it at point C, which is our desired point.

So, let's try to find the envelope of the family of lines x/a + y/b = 1, with the constraint that a² + b² = 1.

To find the envelope, we can use the method for finding the envelope of a family of curves. The envelope satisfies both the equation of the curve and the derivative with respect to the parameter.

In this case, the parameter can be a, and b is determined by a since a² + b² = 1 => b = sqrt(1 - a²). So, we can write the equation as x/a + y / sqrt(1 - a²) = 1.

Let me denote this as F(a) = x/a + y / sqrt(1 - a²) - 1 = 0.

To find the envelope, we can solve for the curve where F(a) = 0 and dF/da = 0.

So, first compute dF/da:

dF/da = -x / a² + (y * (1/2)(1 - a²)^(-3/2) * 2a) ) = -x / a² + (y * a) / (1 - a²)^(3/2) )

Set dF/da = 0:

-x / a² + (y a) / (1 - a²)^(3/2) ) = 0

=> (y a) / (1 - a²)^(3/2) ) = x / a²

Let me denote this as equation (1):

(y a) / (1 - a²)^(3/2) ) = x / a²

And we also have the original equation F(a) = 0:

x/a + y / sqrt(1 - a²) = 1     --> equation (2)

So, we have two equations (1) and (2) that we can solve for x and y in terms of a.

Let me try to solve these.

From equation (1):

(y a) / (1 - a²)^(3/2) ) = x / a²

Let me rearrange this to express y in terms of x:

y a = x / a² * (1 - a²)^(3/2)

=> y = x / a^3 * (1 - a²)^(3/2)

But 1 - a² = b², so (1 - a²)^(3/2) = b^3. So, y = x / a^3 * b^3.

But, since b = sqrt(1 - a²), this is y = x * (b / a)^3.

So, y = x * (b^3 / a^3).

Hmm, but perhaps it's better to express y in terms of x and substitute into equation (2).

So, equation (2) is x/a + y / sqrt(1 - a²) = 1.

From equation (1), we have y = [x (1 - a²)^(3/2)] / a^3.

Plugging this into equation (2):

x/a + [x (1 - a²)^(3/2) / a^3] / sqrt(1 - a²) = 1

Simplify the second term:

[ x (1 - a²)^(3/2) / a^3 ] / sqrt(1 - a²) = x (1 - a²)^(3/2 - 1/2) / a^3 = x (1 - a²)^1 / a^3 = x (1 - a²)/a^3.

So the equation becomes:

x/a + x (1 - a²)/a^3 = 1

Factor out x/a:

x/a [1 + (1 - a²)/a²] = 1

Simplify the term in brackets:

1 + (1 - a²)/a² = 1 + 1/a² - 1 = 1/a²

So, equation becomes:

x/a * (1/a²) ) = 1

=> x/a^3 = 1

=> x = a^3

So, x = a^3.

Now, from equation (1), y = [x (1 - a²)^(3/2)] / a^3.

Since x = a^3, substitute:

y = [a^3 (1 - a²)^(3/2)] / a^3 = (1 - a²)^(3/2)

So, now we have x and y in terms of a:

x = a^3,

y = (1 - a²)^(3/2)

So, the envelope is parametrized by a, with x = a^3 and y = (1 - a²)^(3/2). We can eliminate a to find the relation between x and y.

Let me try to eliminate a.

From x = a^3, we have a = x^(1/3).

Substitute into y:

y = (1 - (x^(1/3))^2 )^(3/2) = (1 - x^(2/3))^(3/2)

So, y = (1 - x^(2/3))^(3/2)

We can write this as:

y² = (1 - x^(2/3))^3

So, expanding (1 - x^(2/3))^3:

(1 - x^(2/3))^3 = 1 - 3x^(2/3) + 3x^(4/3) - x^2

So, y² = 1 - 3x^(2/3) + 3x^(4/3) - x^2

But this seems complicated. Maybe there's a better way to express it.

Alternatively, let me raise both sides to the power of 2/3:

y^(2/3) = 1 - x^(2/3)

So,

x^(2/3) + y^(2/3) = 1

Ah, that's a much simpler equation. So, the envelope is the astroid defined by x^(2/3) + y^(2/3) = 1.

So, the envelope is the astroid x^(2/3) + y^(2/3) = 1.

So, now, the astroid is the envelope of the family F of segments PQ.

So, AB is a segment of F, and it is tangent to the astroid at point C.

So, point C is the point where AB is tangent to the astroid.

So, to find point C, we can find the point of tangency of line AB with the astroid x^(2/3) + y^(2/3) = 1.

So, we can find the tangent to the astroid at point C, which coincides with line AB.

We know the equation of line AB is y = -sqrt(3)x + sqrt(3)/2.

So, the slope of AB is -sqrt(3).

We can find the condition for the astroid to have a tangent with slope -sqrt(3) at point (x, y) on the astroid.

So, the derivative of the astroid equation at point (x, y) will give us the slope of the tangent line.

So, let's differentiate implicitly:

Given x^(2/3) + y^(2/3) = 1,

Differentiate both sides with respect to x:

(2/3)x^(-1/3) + (2/3)y^(-1/3) dy/dx = 0

Solving for dy/dx:

dy/dx = - [ (x^(-1/3)) / (y^(-1/3)) ) ] = - (y^(1/3) / x^(1/3))

So, the slope of the tangent at (x, y) is - (y^(1/3) / x^(1/3)).

We know this slope is equal to -sqrt(3). So,

- (y^(1/3) / x^(1/3)) = -sqrt(3)

Multiply both sides by -1:

y^(1/3) / x^(1/3) = sqrt(3)

=> (y / x)^(1/3) = sqrt(3)

Raise both sides to the power of 3:

y / x = (sqrt(3))^3 = 3^(3/2) = 3 * sqrt(3)

So,

y = 3 sqrt(3) x

So, this is the relation between y and x on the astroid where the tangent has slope -sqrt(3).

But the point (x, y) must also lie on the astroid x^(2/3) + y^(2/3) = 1.

So, substituting y = 3 sqrt(3) x into the astroid equation:

x^(2/3) + (3 sqrt(3) x)^(2/3) = 1

Compute (3 sqrt(3) x)^(2/3
