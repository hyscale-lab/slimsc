Okay, so I've got this problem here about a hyperbola and a rhombus. Let me try to unpack it step by step. 

First, the hyperbola is given by the equation x²/20 - y²/24 = 1. So, this is a standard hyperbola centered at the origin, opening to the sides along the x-axis. The transverse axis is along the x-axis because the positive term is with x². The a² is 20, so a = sqrt(20), which is 2*sqrt(5). The b² is 24, so b is 2*sqrt(6). 

Now, the rhombus is formed by points A, B, C, D on this hyperbola. Since it's a rhombus, all sides are equal in length. Also, the diagonals intersect at the origin, which is the center of the hyperbola. So, the origin is the midpoint of both diagonals.

The question asks for the greatest real number that is less than BD² for all such rhombi. So, BD is one of the diagonals, and we need to find the supremum (the least upper bound) of BD². Essentially, we need to find the maximum possible value of BD², but since the problem says "the greatest real number that is less than BD² for all such rhombi," perhaps it's the minimum upper bound, but I think the wording might mean the maximum BD². Wait, no, let me read again: "the greatest real number that is less than BD² for all such rhombi." Hmm, so it's like the infimum of BD² but from above. Wait, no, opposite. It's the maximum lower bound? Or is it the maximum possible BD²? Hmm, maybe I should clarify.

Wait, no. The problem says "the greatest real number that is less than BD² for all such rhombi." So, it's looking for a number M such that for every such rhombus, BD² is greater than M, and M is the largest such number. So, M is the infimum of BD² over all possible rhombi, but in such a way that M is the greatest lower bound. So, we need to find the minimum value that BD² can take? Wait, no. Because if BD² can be very small, but the problem says "greatest real number less than BD² for all such rhombi," which I think means that M is the maximum lower bound such that M ≤ BD² for all rhombi, and M is as large as possible. So, M is the greatest lower bound (infimum) of BD². So, we need to find the minimum possible BD² across all such rhombi, because the infimum would be the lowest BD² can go, making M equal to that. But wait, if BD² can be as small as possible, then M would be -infinity, which doesn't make sense. So maybe I'm misunderstanding.

Wait, perhaps I should think of it differently. Since BD² is a squared distance, it's always non-negative. So, the greatest real number less than BD² for all rhombi would be the minimum possible BD². Because for any rhombus, BD² is at least M, so M is the minimum possible BD². So, the problem is asking for the minimal BD² possible across all such rhombi, right?

Wait, but the wording is a bit confusing. Let me check again: "Find the greatest real number that is less than BD² for all such rhombi." So, M is such that M < BD² for all rhombi, and M is as large as possible. So, M is the supremum of all such lower bounds. So, M is the infimum of BD². Therefore, M is the smallest possible BD². So, we need to find the minimal BD² possible.

But I'm not entirely sure. Maybe the problem is phrased as "the greatest real number less than BD² for all rhombi," meaning that M is the maximum such that M < BD² for every rhombus. So, M is the infimum
