Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the radius of the smallest sphere that can contain any rectangular box from a set B. Each box in B has a surface area of 54 and a volume of 23. Then, I need to find r squared, express it as a fraction p/q where p and q are coprime, and then find p+q.

Hmm, let's start by recalling some formulas for rectangular boxes. A rectangular box has length, width, and height, let's say a, b, c. The surface area S is given by 2(ab + bc + ac) = 54. The volume V is given by abc = 23.

I need to find the smallest sphere that can contain any such box. The sphere's radius would be half the space diagonal of the box because the space diagonal is the longest distance between any two vertices of the box, right? So the space diagonal d is sqrt(a² + b² + c²). Therefore, the radius r would be d/2, so r squared is (a² + b² + c²)/4.

So, my goal is to find the minimum possible value of (a² + b² + c²)/4, given the constraints 2(ab + bc + ac) = 54 and abc = 23.

Wait, no. Hold on. I think I need to maximize the space diagonal, but actually, the sphere needs to contain all such boxes. So, the minimal sphere that can contain any box from B must have a radius equal to the maximum possible space diagonal among all boxes in B divided by 2. So, actually, I need to find the maximum value of the space diagonal d = sqrt(a² + b² + c²), given the constraints on surface area and volume. Then, r would be that maximum d divided by 2, and r² would be (d²)/4 = (a² + b² + c²)/4.

Wait, but I'm confused now. Because if each box has surface area 54 and volume 23, then the sphere needs to contain all possible such boxes. So, which box in B has the maximum space diagonal? So, the sphere with radius equal to half the maximum space diagonal would contain all other boxes as well, since any other box would have a smaller space diagonal.

So, I need to find the maximum value of a² + b² + c², given the constraints 2(ab + bc + ac) = 54 and abc = 23.

Okay, so let's write down the given:

1. 2(ab + bc + ac) = 54 => ab + bc + ac = 27.

2. abc = 23.

We need to maximize a² + b² + c².

I remember that (a + b + c)² = a² + b² + c² + 2(ab + bc + ac). So, a² + b² + c² = (a + b + c)² - 2(ab + bc + ac) = (a + b + c)² - 2*27 = (a + b + c)² - 54.

So, to maximize a² + b² + c², we need to maximize (a + b + c)^2, which in turn requires maximizing (a + b + c).

Hmm, or wait, maybe it's the other way around? Because if a, b, c are being varied, how does their sum relate to the expressions?

Wait, no, let me think again. Because if I can express a² + b² + c² in terms of (a + b + c), and given that (a + b + c)^2 is being subtracted by 54, then the maximum of a² + b² + c² occurs when (a + b + c)^2 is maximum.

So, to maximize a² + b² + c², we need to maximize (a + b + c). So, the problem reduces to finding the maximum possible value of a +
