Okay, so I've got this problem about finding the number of rectangles that can be formed inside a regular dodecagon. Each side of the rectangle has to lie either on a side or a diagonal of the dodecagon. Hmm, that sounds a bit tricky, but let me try to break it down.

First off, a regular dodecagon has 12 sides, all equal in length, and all internal angles are equal too. Each internal angle is 150 degrees, I think. But maybe that's not super important right now. What I need to focus on is how to form rectangles within this shape.

The problem mentions that each side of the rectangle lies on either a side or a diagonal of the dodecagon. So, the sides of the rectangle can be either edges of the dodecagon or diagonals connecting non-adjacent vertices.

I remember that in regular polygons, especially those with an even number of sides, it's possible to draw various diagonals that can form rectangles. For instance, in a regular hexagon, you can form rectangles by connecting every other vertex. But a dodecagon is more complex with 12 sides, so there must be more possibilities.

Let me visualize a regular dodecagon. It has 12 vertices equally spaced around a circle. Each vertex can be connected to others via sides or diagonals. The key here is that for a rectangle to be formed, the opposite sides must be equal and parallel, and the angles must be 90 degrees.

Wait, but in a regular dodecagon, the sides and diagonals can have different lengths. So, how do I ensure that the sides of the rectangle are either sides or diagonals?

Maybe I need to consider the distances between vertices. In a regular dodecagon, the length of a diagonal depends on how many vertices it skips. For example, connecting adjacent vertices is a side, then skipping one vertex gives a shorter diagonal, skipping two gives a longer one, and so on.

But how does that relate to forming right angles? Hmm, maybe I should think in terms of vectors or coordinate geometry. If I assign coordinates to the vertices, I can check if the sides of a quadrilateral form right angles.

But that might get complicated. Alternatively, perhaps I can think about the symmetries of the dodecagon. Since it's regular, it has rotational and reflectional symmetries. Maybe the number of rectangles can be determined by the number of pairs of parallel sides that are perpendicular to each other.

Wait, in a regular polygon, the sides and certain diagonals are perpendicular. So, perhaps the rectangles can be formed by choosing two pairs of parallel lines (which can be sides or diagonals) that are perpendicular to each other.

So, to form a rectangle, I need two sets of parallel lines: one set for the length and another set for the width, and they have to be perpendicular.

In a regular dodecagon, there are multiple directions for these lines. Let's think about the number of directions available. Each side and diagonal can be thought of as vectors with different angles.

Since a dodecagon has 12 sides, the angle between adjacent vertices from the center is 30 degrees (360/12). So, the direction of each side is every 30 degrees. But the diagonals can
