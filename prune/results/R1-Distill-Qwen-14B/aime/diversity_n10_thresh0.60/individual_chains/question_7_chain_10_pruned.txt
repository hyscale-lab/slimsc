Okay, so I'm trying to solve this probability problem about a regular octagon where each vertex is colored red or blue with equal chance. The question is asking for the probability that the octagon can be rotated so that all the blue vertices end up where the red ones were originally. They mention that this probability is m/n, and we need to find m + n where m and n are coprime.

Hmm, let me break this down. So, a regular octagon has eight vertices, each colored red or blue, each color equally likely. So, each vertex has a 50% chance of being red or blue, independent of the others.

The key part is that we can rotate the octagon such that all blue vertices move to positions that were originally red. That means, after some rotation, every blue vertex should align with a red vertex from the starting configuration.

Wait, so essentially, we're looking for colorings where there's a rotation (by some number of steps) that maps the set of blue vertices to the set of red vertices.

I remember that in group theory, the octagon's symmetry group is the dihedral group D8, which includes rotations and reflections. But since the problem is only talking about rotations, not reflections, perhaps we should only consider rotational symmetries.

So, the rotational symmetries of a regular octagon are rotations by 0°, 45°, 90°, ..., up to 315°, which correspond to rotating by 0, 1, 2, ..., 7 steps (since each step is 45°). So the rotation group here is cyclic of order 8.

So, the set of all possible rotations is {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7} steps, where each step is 45°. We need to find colorings where there exists a rotation such that when we apply that rotation, all the blue vertices (after rotation) were originally red.

Another way to think about this: for a given coloring, let B be the set of blue vertices, and R be the set of red vertices. We need a rotation such that rotation(B) = R.

But wait, since the octagon is regular, the set of blue vertices must be a rotation of the set of red vertices. So, for the coloring to satisfy the condition, there must exist a rotation that maps B to R.

But since the octagon is symmetric, R is just the
