Okay, so I've got this math problem here. Let me read it again and try to understand what it's asking.

It says: Let N be the greatest four-digit positive integer with the property that whenever one of its digits is changed to 1, the resulting number is divisible by 7. Then, Q and R are the quotient and remainder when N is divided by 1000. We need to find Q + R.

Alright, breaking this down. N is a four-digit number. So it's between 1000 and 9999. The key property is that if you change any one of its digits to 1, the new number is divisible by 7. We need the greatest such N, so we're looking for the largest possible four-digit number with this property.

Once we find N, we divide it by 1000. The quotient is Q, the remainder is R, and we need to add Q and R together.

So, first, let's figure out what N is. Let's denote N as a four-digit number: N = ABCD, where A, B, C, D are its digits, with A not zero.

The property is that if we change any one digit to 1, the resulting number is divisible by 7. So, changing A to 1, B to 1, C to 1, or D to 1 should each result in a number divisible by 7.

Let me write that out:

1. Changing A to 1: 1BCD must be divisible by 7.
2. Changing B to 1: A1CD must be divisible by 7.
3. Changing C to 1: AB1D must be divisible by 7.
4. Changing D to 1: ABC1 must be divisible by 7.

So, N is such that all four of these transformed numbers are divisible by 7.

Our goal is to find the largest N (so starting from 9999 and moving downwards) that satisfies all these four conditions.

Hmm, okay, so perhaps we can model each condition and find constraints on the digits A, B, C, D.

Let me consider each condition:

1. 1BCD ≡ 0 mod 7
2. A1CD ≡ 0 mod 7
3. AB1D ≡ 0 mod 7
4. ABC1 ≡ 0 mod 7

Each of these implies a certain relationship between the digits.

I think the key is to express each of these conditions in terms of the digits and then find equations or congruences that the digits must satisfy.

Let me write N as 1000A + 100B + 10C + D.

Then:

1. 1BCD = 1000*1 + 100B + 10C + D = 1000 + 100B + 10C + D
   So, 1000 + 100B + 10C + D ≡ 0 mod 7.

2. A1CD = 1000A + 100*1 + 10C + D = 1000A + 100 + 10C + D
   So, 1000A + 100 + 10C + D ≡ 0 mod 7.

3. AB1D = 1000A + 100B + 10*1 + D = 1000A + 100B + 10 + D
   So, 1000A + 100B + 10 + D ≡ 0 mod 7.

4. ABC1 = 1000A + 100B + 10C + 1
   So, 1000A + 100B + 10C + 1 ≡ 0 mod 7.

Now, let's compute each of these modulo 7.

But before that, perhaps it's useful to compute 1000 mod 7, 100 mod 7, 10 mod 7, etc., since these coefficients can be simplified modulo 7.

Compute:

10 mod 7 = 3

10^2 = 100 mod 7: 100 /7 is 14*7=98, remainder 2. So 100 mod 7 =2.

10^3=1000 mod 7: 1000 /7: 142*7=994, so 1000-994=6. So 1000 mod7=6.

Similarly, 10^4 mod7, but since N is four-digit, we might not need that.

So:

10 mod7=3

10^2 mod7=2

10^3 mod7=6

10^4 mod7= 10*6=60 mod7=4 (since 7*8=56, 60-56=4)

Wait, but in our case, the numbers are four-digit, so when we change a digit, the number remains four-digit. So for the first condition, 1BCD, that's four digits, so it's 1000 + B*100 + C*10 + D.

So, when we write 1BCD mod7, it's 1000 + 100B +10C + D mod7.

But 1000 mod7=6, 100 mod7=2, 10 mod7=3, so:

1BCD mod7 = (6 + 2B + 3C + D) mod7 =0.

Similarly, let's process the four conditions:

1. 1BCD ≡ 0 mod7: 6 + 2B + 3C + D ≡0 mod7.

2. A1CD: 1000A +100 + 10C + D mod7.

1000A mod7=6A, 100 mod7=2, 10C mod7=3C, D mod7.

So, A1CD mod7= (6A +2 +3C + D) ≡0 mod7.

3. AB1D: 1000A +100B +10 + D mod7.

1000A mod7=6A, 100B mod7=2B, 10 mod7=3, D mod7.

So, AB1D mod7= (6A +2B +3 + D) ≡0 mod7.

4. ABC1: 1000A +100B +10C +1 mod7.

1000A mod7=6A, 100B mod7=2B, 10C mod7=3C, 1 mod7.

So, ABC1 mod7= (6A +2B +3C +1) ≡0 mod7.

So, now we have four congruences:

1. 6 + 2B + 3C + D ≡0 mod7.  -- Equation (1)

2. 6A + 2 + 3C + D ≡0 mod7.  -- Equation (2)

3. 6A + 2B +3 + D ≡0 mod7.  -- Equation (3)

4. 6A + 2B +3C +1 ≡0 mod7.  -- Equation (4)

So, four equations with four variables: A, B, C, D. But each is a digit, so they can take values from 0 to 9, except A which is from 1 to 9.

Our goal is to find the largest N, so we need to find the maximum possible A, then B, then C, then D.

So, perhaps we can solve these equations step by step.

Let me try to manipulate the equations.

First, let's subtract Equation (1) from Equation (2):

Equation (2) - Equation (1):

(6A +2 +3C + D) - (6 + 2B +3C + D) = 6A +2 +3C + D -6 -2B -3C -D = 6A -2B -4 ≡0 mod7.

So, 6A -2B -4 ≡0 mod7.

Simplify:

6A -2B ≡4 mod7.

Multiply both sides by the inverse of 2 mod7 to simplify. Since 2*4=8≡1 mod7, so inverse of 2 is 4.

Multiply both sides by 4:

(6A -2B)*4 ≡4*4 mod7

=> 24A -8B ≡16 mod7.

Compute 24 mod7: 24/7=3*7=21, 24-21=3, so 24A ≡3A.

-8 mod7: 8 mod7=1, so -8 ≡-1 mod7.

16 mod7: 16-14=2.

So, 3A - B ≡2 mod7.  -- Let's call this Equation (5).

Similarly, subtract Equation (3) from Equation (2):

Equation (2) - Equation (3):

(6A +2 +3C + D) - (6A +2B +3 + D) = 6A +2 +3C + D -6A -2B -3 - D = (2 -3) + (3C) + (-2B) = (-1) +3C -2B ≡0 mod7.

So, 3C -2B -1 ≡0 mod7.

Which is 3C -2B ≡1 mod7.  -- Let's call this Equation (6).

Now, let's subtract Equation (3) from Equation (4):

Equation (4) - Equation (3):

(6A +2B +3C +1) - (6A +2B +3 + D) = 6A +2B +3C +1 -6A -2B -3 - D = (3C -2) - D +1 = 3C - D -2 ≡0 mod7.

So, 3C - D ≡2 mod7.  -- Equation (7).

Now, we have Equations (5), (6), (7):

Equation (5): 3A - B ≡2 mod7.

Equation (6): 3C -2B ≡1 mod7.

Equation (7): 3C - D ≡2 mod7.

Let me try to express B from Equation (5):

From Equation (5): 3A - B ≡2 => B ≡3A -2 mod7.

So, B = (3A -2) mod7.

Since B is a digit (0-9), it's possible that B = (3A -2) +7k, where k is an integer such that B remains in 0-9.

Similarly, from Equation (6): 3C -2B ≡1 mod7.

We can substitute B from Equation (5) into Equation (6):

3C -2*(3A -2) ≡1 mod7.

Compute:

3C -6A +4 ≡1 mod7.

Simplify:

3C -6A ≡-3 ≡4 mod7.

So, 3C ≡6A -3 mod7.

Divide both sides by 3. Since 3 and 7 are coprime, 3^{-1} mod7 is 5 because 3*5=15≡1 mod7.

Multiply both sides by 5:

C ≡(6A -3)*5 mod7.

Compute 6*5=30≡2 mod7, and -3*5=-15≡-1 mod7.

So, C ≡2A -1 mod7.

So, C = (2A -1) mod7.

Now, from Equation (7): 3C - D ≡2 mod7.

Substituting C:

3*(2A -1) - D ≡2 mod7.

Compute:

6A -3 - D ≡2 mod7.

So, 6A - D ≡5 mod7.

So, D ≡6A -5 mod7.

So, D = (6A -5) mod7.

So, now we have expressions for B, C, D in terms of A:

B = (3A -2) mod7,

C = (2A -1) mod7,

D = (6A -5) mod7.

But since A is a digit from 1 to 9, let's compute B, C, D for each A from 9 down to 1, and see which combinations result in all digits being valid (0-9) and N is as large as possible.

Our goal is to find the largest N, so starting from A=9 and moving down to A=1.

Let me make a table for each A from 9 to 1, compute B, C, D, and check if they are digits (0-9).

Also, we need to ensure that when we compute N, all the four conditions are satisfied. But perhaps if we compute them as per the mod7 equations, they automatically satisfy the conditions. Let's proceed.

Let's start with A=9.

A=9:

Compute B: (3*9 -2) mod7 = (27-2)=25 mod7.

25 /7=3*7=21, 25-21=4. So B=4.

C: (2*9 -1) mod7= (18-1)=17 mod7.

17-14=3, so C=3.

D: (6*9 -5) mod7= (54-5)=49 mod7=0. So D=0.

So, digits are A=9, B=4, C=3, D=0.

So N=9430.

Now, let's check if this N satisfies all four conditions.

1. Change A to 1: 1430.

Check 1430 divisible by7: 1430 /7=204.285... Let's compute 7*204=1428, 1430-1428=2. So remainder 2. Not divisible by7. So this N=9430 doesn't satisfy the first condition.

Hmm, that's a problem. So our initial approach might have a mistake. Because according to our equations, it should satisfy all four conditions, but it doesn't.

Wait, perhaps the issue is that when we computed B, C, D, we took them mod7, but digits can be higher, right? Because mod7 gives residues from 0 to6, but the digits go up to9.

Wait, but in our equations, B, C, D are defined modulo7. So, for example, B could be (3A -2) +7k, where k is an integer such that B remains a digit (0-9). Similarly for C and D.

So, perhaps when we computed B, C, D, we need to adjust them to be in 0-9 by adding multiples of7.

Wait, I think I see the mistake. When I computed B=(3A -2) mod7, I just took the remainder, but B can be equal to that remainder plus 7 or 14, as long as it's a digit.

Similarly for C and D.

So, for A=9:

B=(3*9 -2)=25. 25 mod7=4, so B can be 4 or 11 (4+7) or 18 (4+14), but B must be a digit (0-9), so B=4 or 11 is invalid, so
