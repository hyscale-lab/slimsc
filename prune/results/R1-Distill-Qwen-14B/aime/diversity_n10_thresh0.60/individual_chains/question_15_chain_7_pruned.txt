Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the number of paths of length 16 on an 8x8 grid. These paths start from the lower left corner and go to the upper right corner. The catch is that the paths must change direction exactly four times. Hmm, this seems a bit tricky, but let me try to break it down.

First, I remember that on an 8x8 grid, moving from the lower left to the upper right requires moving 8 steps to the right and 8 steps up, totaling 16 steps. So, without any restrictions, the number of such paths is the combination of 16 steps taken 8 at a time, which is C(16,8). But wait, we have a constraint here: the path must change direction exactly four times. So, I can't just use the basic combination formula.

Let me think about what it means to change direction exactly four times. Each time the direction changes, the path switches from moving right to up or vice versa. So, starting from the lower left, the first move could be either right or up. Each direction change increments the count. So, if the direction changes exactly four times, how does that structure the path?

Let's consider that each time the direction changes, the path alternates between moving right and moving up. So, if there are four direction changes, that would break the path into five segments. Each segment is a consecutive sequence of moves in one direction. For example, the path might go right, then up, then right, then up, then right, etc., but with four changes, the number of segments would be five.

Wait, actually, no. Let me correct that. If there are four direction changes, the number of segments is five because each change starts a new segment. So, starting from the initial direction, each direction change adds another segment. So, the number of segments is one more than the number of direction changes. So, four direction changes mean five segments.

Now, each segment must consist of at least one step because you can't have a segment with zero steps. So, the problem now reduces to partitioning the total right steps (8) and up steps (8) into these five segments in such a way that each segment alternates between right and up directions.

But wait, actually, since the path starts either right or up. Let me clarify: the first move is either right or up, then alternates. So, the number of right segments and
