Okay, let's try to solve this problem. So, we have triangle ABC inscribed in a circle ω. The tangents at B and C meet at point D, and then line AD intersects ω again at point P. We're given the lengths AB=5, BC=9, and AC=10. We need to find AP, which can be written as a fraction m/n where m and n are coprime, and then find m + n.

Hmm, first, I remember that when two tangents are drawn from a point outside a circle, those tangents are equal in length. So, since D is the intersection of the tangents at B and C, we have DB = DC. That might come in handy later.

I also recall that the point where the tangents meet, D, has some properties related to the triangle ABC. Maybe something about angles? Like, the angle between tangent and chord is equal to the angle in the alternate segment. So, angle DBC is equal to angle BAC, and similarly, angle DCB equals angle BAC as well? Wait, no, let me think again. The angle between tangent at B and chord BC is equal to the angle in the alternate segment, which would be angle BAC. Similarly for tangent at C and chord CB, the angle would be equal to angle BAC. So, that would mean that angles DBC and DCB are both equal to angle BAC. Interesting.

Wait, if angles DBC and DCB are both equal to angle BAC, then triangle DBC is isoceles with DB = DC, which we already knew. So, triangle DBC is isoceles with DB=DC.

Okay, so maybe we can find some similar triangles here. Since AD intersects the circle again at P, perhaps there's a power of a point involved. Power of point A with respect to ω? Wait, but A is on ω, so its power is zero. Hmm, maybe point D? Since D is outside the circle, its power with respect to ω is DB² = DC² = DA * DP. Ah, yes, that's right. The power of point D with respect to ω is equal to DB², which should be equal to DA * DP.

So, Power of D: DB² = DA * DP.

If we can find DA, then we
