Okay, so I'm trying to solve this geometry problem about a convex equilateral hexagon. Let me try to break it down and figure out what I know and what I need to find.

First, the problem says ABCDEF is a convex equilateral hexagon with all pairs of opposite sides parallel. So, that means AB is parallel to DE, BC is parallel to EF, and CD is parallel to FA. Also, since it's equilateral, all the sides are equal in length. I need to find the side length of the hexagon.

The other information given is about a triangle formed by extending the sides AB, CD, and EF. The sides of this triangle are 200, 240, and 300. So, I guess this triangle is bigger than the hexagon and somehow related to it.

Hmm, okay, since opposite sides are parallel, this hexagon is what's called a "parallelotope" or maybe a "zontoid." But I'm not sure about the exact terminology. Anyway, the key point is that it's convex and equilateral with opposite sides parallel.

I remember that when you have a convex polygon with opposite sides parallel, it can sometimes be thought of as a translated or sheared version of a regular polygon. But since it's equilateral but not necessarily regular, the angles might not all be equal.

Wait, but in a regular hexagon, all sides and angles are equal, and opposite sides are parallel. So, maybe this hexagon is similar but not regular because the sides could be sheared. So, perhaps it's a affine transformation of a regular hexagon.

An affine transformation can stretch or shear a shape, but it preserves parallelism and ratios of lengths along lines. So, if I can model this hexagon as an affine transformation of a regular hexagon, maybe I can use the properties of affine transformations to relate the triangle sides to the hexagon's side length.

But I'm not entirely sure how to proceed with that. Maybe I need to think about the triangle formed by the extensions of AB, CD, and EF.

Let me visualize this. If I extend AB, CD, and EF, they meet to form a triangle. The sides of this triangle are 200, 240, and 300. So, each side of the triangle is formed by the extension of one of these sides of the hexagon.

Since the hexagon is convex, each of these sides is extended in one direction beyond the hexagon to form the triangle.

Wait, but AB, CD, and EF are opposite sides. So, AB is opposite to DE, CD is opposite to FA, and EF is opposite to BC. So, when I extend AB, CD, and EF, they form a triangle outside the hexagon.

I think I need to model this in terms of similar triangles or something related to the ratios. Maybe there's a way to express the side lengths of the triangle in terms of the hexagon's side length and some scaling factor.

Alternatively, perhaps the triangle can be divided into smaller triangles or parallelograms, each related to the hexagon's structure.

Wait, another thought: in a convex equilateral hexagon with opposite sides parallel, the sides can be represented as vectors. So, let's consider vectors for each side.

Let me denote each side as a vector. Since opposite sides are equal
