Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this game problem where Alice and Bob take turns removing either 1 or 4 tokens from a stack of n tokens. The person who takes the last token wins. I need to find how many positive integers n â‰¤ 2024 where Bob can always win, no matter how Alice plays.

Hmm, let's start by understanding the rules. Alice goes first, so she has the initial move. Each player can remove 1 or 4 tokens on their turn. The goal is to take the last token, so if you can force the other player into a position where they can't win, you win.

I think this is a combinatorial game problem, so maybe I can model it using the concept of winning and losing positions. A winning position is one where the current player can force a win, and a losing position is where no matter what the current player does, the opponent can force a win.

So, let's try to define the positions. Let's say for a given number of tokens n, if the current player can make a move that leads the opponent into a losing position, then n is a winning position. Otherwise, it's a losing position.

Base cases:
- n=0: Well, the game is over, so this is a losing position because there are no tokens to take.
- n=1: The current player can take the last token and win. So, this is a winning position.
- n=2: Current player takes 1 token, leaving 1 for the opponent, who can then take it and win. Alternatively, the current player could take 1 token, leaving 1, which we know is a winning position for the opponent. Wait, so if n=2, the current player can take 1, leaving n=1 (a winning position for the opponent). Or, can the current player take 4? No, because 4 > 2. So, if n=2, the current player must take 1, leaving n=1, which is a winning position for the opponent. So, n=2 would be a losing position for the current player. Wait, but that can't be right. Because if n=2, the current player must take 1, then the opponent takes the last one and wins. So, the current player can't force a win, meaning n=2 is a losing position.

Wait, but in the case of n=1, it's a winning position because you take it and win. So for n=2, the current player can't win because taking 1 leaves n=1 for the opponent, who then takes it and wins. So n=2 is a losing position.

n=3: Let's see. The current player can take 1, leaving n=2, which we just determined is a losing position for the opponent. So, if the current player takes 1, leaving n=2, the opponent is in a losing position. Therefore, n=3 is a winning position.

n=4: The current player can take 4 tokens and win immediately. So, n=4 is a winning position.

n=5: The current player can take 1, leaving n=4. Since n=4 is a winning position for the opponent, the opponent can take all 4 and win. Alternatively, the current player can take 4, leaving n=1. Then, the opponent takes 1 and wins. So, in both cases, the opponent can win. So, n=5 is a losing position for the current player.

Wait, but let me think again. If n=5, the current player can choose between taking 1 or 4. If they take 1, the opponent gets n=4, which is a winning position for them, so they can win. If the current player takes 4, leaving n=1, opponent takes 1 and wins. So, both options lead to the opponent winning, so n=5 is a losing position.

n=6: Let's see. Taking 1 leaves n=5, which is a losing position for the opponent. So, the current player can take 1, leaving n=5, which is a losing position for the opponent. Therefore, n=6 is a winning position.

n=7:
