Okay, so I've got this math problem about Aya's morning walks. Hmm, let me try to understand what's going on here. So every morning, Aya walks 9 kilometers and then stops at a coffee shop. The problem gives me two different scenarios with different walking speeds and the time each takes, including the time she spends in the coffee shop. Then, I need to find out how long her walk takes when she walks at a different speed, s + 1/2 km/h, including the coffee shop time.

Alright, let me parse the information step by step.

First scenario: She walks at a constant speed of s km/h, and the total time for the walk, including t minutes at the coffee shop, is 4 hours. Wait, 4 hours including t minutes? So the actual walking time is less than 4 hours, right? Because she spends t minutes in the coffee shop. So I think the total time is walking time plus t minutes, which equals 4 hours.

Second scenario: She walks at s + 2 km/h, and the total time is 2 hours and 24 minutes, again including t minutes. So similarly, the walking time is 2 hours and 24 minutes minus t minutes.

Wait, but actually, 4 hours and 2 hours and 24 minutes â€“ these are the total times, which include walking plus coffee shop time. So let's convert everything into the same units to make it easier. I think converting everything to hours or everything to minutes might be helpful.

Let me note down the given data:

1. First case:
   - Speed = s km/h
   - Total time (walking + coffee) = 4 hours
   - Distance walked = 9 km

2. Second case:
   - Speed = (s + 2) km/h
   - Total time (walking + coffee) = 2 hours 24 minutes
   - Distance walked = 9 km

We're asked to find the total time when she walks at s + 1/2 km/h, including t minutes at the coffee shop.

So, let's model this with equations.

First, the time she spends walking can be calculated by distance divided by speed. Since distance is 9 km, the walking time in each case is 9 / speed.

But wait, the total time includes the coffee shop time, so in the first case, the total time is walking time plus t minutes, which is
