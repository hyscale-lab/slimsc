Okay, so I've got this math problem here, and I'm supposed to find the sum of the squares of all the items in a list that has certain properties. Let me try to break this down step by step.

First, let me list out the properties again to make sure I don't miss anything:

1. The sum of all the items is 30.
2. The unique mode is 9.
3. The median is a positive integer that doesn't appear in the list.

Hmm, okay. So, the list is made up of positive integers. That means each number is at least 1.

Starting with the mode: the unique mode is 9. Mode means the number that appears most frequently. So, 9 must appear more times than any other number in the list. And it's unique, so no other number can have the same frequency as 9. So, if 9 appears twice, every other number can appear at most once. If 9 appears three times, others can appear up to two times, etc.

Next, the median is a positive integer that doesn't appear in the list. The median is the middle number when the numbers are arranged in order. Since it's a positive integer, the median is at least 1. Also, it's not in the list itself.

So, let's think about how the list can be structured.

I should probably figure out how many numbers are in the list. Let's denote the number of elements as n. Since the median is a positive integer not in the list, n must be such that the middle position isn't 9. Also, since the mode is 9, 9 must appear more frequently than any other number.

Wait, but without knowing n, it's a bit tricky. Maybe I can find possible values of n.

Let me think about possible values of n. Since the sum is 30, the average is 30/n. Since all numbers are positive integers, n can't be too large. Let's see:

If n is 1, sum is 30. Then the list is [30], but the mode would be 30, which contradicts the mode being 9. So n can't be 1.

n=2: sum is 30. The list would have two numbers, say a and b, with a ≤ b. The median would be (a+b)/2. But since the median has to be an integer, (a + b) must be even. Also, the median can't be in the list. But the numbers are a and b, so the median is different from both. That's possible. Let's see if it's possible to have 9 as the mode. Since it's a list of two numbers, the mode would need to appear at least twice. So, the list would have to be [9,21], but then mode would be unique? Wait, no, if both are 9, then sum is 18, which is less than 30. So that's not possible. Alternatively, if one is 9 and the other is 21, the mode is 9 but only appears once. That's not possible because mode has to appear more than any other number. So, for n=2, the mode can't be 9 because 9 can appear only once, which is not more than any other number if the other is also distinct. So n=2 is not possible.

n=3: Let's think. The list has three numbers: a, b, c with a ≤ b ≤ c. The median is b. The median has to be a positive integer not in the list. Wait, but b is part of the list. So the median can't be in the list. That's a problem. Because for n=3, the median is the second number, which is part of the list. So that's a contradiction. Therefore, n cannot be 3.

n=4: The median would be the average of the second and third numbers. So, (b + c)/2. It has to be an integer, so (b + c) must be even. Also, the median must not be
