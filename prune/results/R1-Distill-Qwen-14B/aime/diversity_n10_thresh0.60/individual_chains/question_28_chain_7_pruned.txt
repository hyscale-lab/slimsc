Okay, so I've got this problem about a tetrahedron ABCD with specific edge lengths, and I need to find the distance from a point inside it to each of its faces. The point I is such that its distances to all four faces are equal. I think this point is called the incenter or something like that. I remember in triangles, the inradius is the distance from the incenter to each side, so maybe in a tetrahedron, the inradius is the distance from the incenter to each face.

First, the problem gives me the edge lengths: AB and CD are both sqrt(41), AC and BD are sqrt(80), and BC and AD are sqrt(89). Hmm, so each pair of opposite edges are equal. That seems symmetrical. Maybe the tetrahedron is isohedral or something? Or maybe it's a kind of symmetric tetrahedron where opposite edges are equal. I think such tetrahedrons have some nice properties, like maybe their inradius can be found using some formula.

I recall that for a tetrahedron, the inradius (r) can be found by the formula r = 3V / S, where V is the volume and S is the total surface area. So, I need to find the volume and the surface area of this tetrahedron.

But how do I compute the volume? Hmm, since it's a tetrahedron with all opposite edges equal, maybe I can use some formula specific to such tetrahedrons. Or maybe I can compute it using coordinates.

Wait, maybe I can assign coordinates to the vertices to make the problem easier. Let me try that.

Let me place the tetrahedron in 3D space. Let me try to assign coordinates such that some edges are along the axes or something symmetric.

Wait, I remember that in such symmetric tetrahedrons, opposite edges are equal, and you can sometimes place the vertices so that midpoints are at the origin or something. Let me think.

Let me denote the points as A, B, C, D. Since AB = CD, AC = BD, and BC = AD, it suggests some kind of symmetry. Maybe a tetrahedron where each pair of opposite edges are equal.

Alternatively, I might recall that such a tetrahedron can be embedded in a cuboid, where the edges correspond to face diagonals. Wait
