Okay, so I've got this problem where Alice and Bob are playing a game with a stack of n tokens. They take turns removing either 1 or 4 tokens each time. Alice goes first, and whoever takes the last token wins. I need to find how many positive integers n â‰¤ 2024 where Bob can guarantee a win, no matter how Alice plays.

Hmm, I think this is a combinatorial game theory problem. I remember something about winning and losing positions. A winning position is one where the current player can force a win, and a losing position is where no matter what the current player does, the opponent can force a win.

So, the first step is probably to figure out for which values of n Bob can force a win. Since Bob is the second player, that means for those n, Alice is in a losing position if both play optimally.

Let me try to model the game. Let's think recursively. For a given n, if the current player can make a move that leads the opponent into a losing position, then n is a winning position. Otherwise, it's a losing position.

Let's define the positions as either winning (W) or losing (L). The base case is when n=0, which is a losing position because the player can't make a move. So, n=0 is L.

Now, for n=1: the player can take 1 token and win, so n=1 is W.
n=2: take 1, leaving 1 for the opponent, who can then win. So wait, if I leave the opponent at n=1, which is a winning position for them, that's bad. But can I take 4? No, because n=2 <4. So for n=2, the only move is to take 1, leaving n=1 (W for opponent). So n=2 is L? Wait, that can't be right because taking 1 from n=2 leaves n=1, which is a W for the opponent. So the current player can't force the opponent into an L position, which would make n=2 a losing position for the current player. So, n=2 is L.

Wait, no. Let me think again. If n=2, and it's your turn. You take 1, leaving n=1 for the opponent. Then the opponent can take 1 and win. So you lose. Therefore, n=2 is a losing position for the current player. So n=2 is L.

n=3: similar. Take 1, leaving n=2 (which is L for the opponent). So if you take 1, opponent is left with L, which means you can force them into a losing position. So n=3 is W.

n=4: you can take 4 and win immediately, so n=4 is W.

n=5: Let's see. If you take 1, leaving n=4 (W). If you take 4, leaving n=1 (W). So both moves leave the opponent in a W position, which means n=5 is L.

Wait, is that right? Because if n=5 and you take 1, opponent gets n=4 (W), which means they can win. If you take 4, opponent gets n=1 (W), they can win. So n=5 is
