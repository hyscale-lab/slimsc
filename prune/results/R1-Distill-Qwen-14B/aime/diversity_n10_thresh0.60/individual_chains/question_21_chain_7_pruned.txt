Okay, so I've got this math problem here, and I need to figure out the least integer base b (where b is at least 2) for which there are more than ten b-eautiful integers. Hmm, let me parse this step by step.

First, let me understand what a b-eautiful integer is. The problem says that a positive integer n is b-eautiful if two conditions are met:

1. When expressed in base b, n has exactly two digits. So, n is a two-digit number in base b.
2. The sum of these two digits equals the square root of n.

They gave an example: 81 is 13-eautiful because 81 in base 13 is 63 (since 6*13 + 3 = 81), and 6 + 3 equals sqrt(81) which is 9. Got it.

So, my task is to find the smallest base b (≥2) such that the number of b-eautiful integers is more than ten. That means, for each base b, count how many numbers n satisfy the two conditions, and find the smallest b where this count exceeds 10.

Let me break down the problem:

First, express n in base b as a two-digit number. In base b, a two-digit number is of the form ab_b, where a and b are digits in base b. Wait, actually, it's a bit different. In base b, the two digits are the tens place and the units place. So, the number n can be written as:

n = a * b + c

where a and c are digits in base b. But since it's a two-digit number, a cannot be zero (as that would make it a single-digit number). So, a ranges from 1 to b-1, and c ranges from 0 to b-1.

Now, the sum of the digits a + c must equal sqrt(n). So, sqrt(n) must be an integer because the sum of two integers is an integer. Therefore, n must be a perfect square.

So, n is a perfect square, and when written in base b, it's a two-digit number where the digits add up to sqrt(n). Let's denote sqrt(n) as s, so s = a + c. Then, n = s^2, and also n = a*b + c.

Putting those together:

s^2 = a*b + c

But since s = a + c, we can substitute:

s^2 = a*b + (s - a)

Because c = s - a.

Simplifying:

s^2 = a*b + s - a

Bring all terms to one side:

s^2 - s + a - a*b = 0

Factor a out of the last two terms:

s^2 - s + a*(1 - b) = 0

Hmm, not sure if that helps. Maybe rearrange:

s^2 - s = a*(b - 1)

So,

a = (s^2 - s) / (b - 1)

Since a must be an integer between 1 and b-1, and c must be between 0 and b-1, and s must be a positive integer as well.

So, for each base b, we can explore possible values of s and a to see if they satisfy the above equation and the constraints on a and c.

But perhaps a better approach is to express everything in terms of s, a, and b. Let me try another approach.

Given that n = s^2 = a*b + c, and c = s - a.

So, substituting c:

s^2 = a*b + (s - a)

Which gives:

s^2 = a*(b - 1) + s

Rearranged:

s^2 - s = a*(b - 1)

So,

a = (s^2 - s) / (b - 1)

Since a must be a positive integer, (s^2 - s) must be divisible by (b - 1). Also, a must satisfy 1 ≤ a ≤ b - 1, and c = s - a must satisfy 0 ≤ c ≤ b - 1.

So, for a given b, we can think of s as varying such that s^2 is a two-digit number in base b, which means that s^2 is between b (the smallest two-digit number in base b, which is 10_b = b) and (b^2 - 1) (the largest two-digit number in base b, which is (b-1)*b + (b-1) = b^2 - 1).

So, the possible values of s^2 must satisfy:

b ≤ s^2 ≤ b^2 - 1

Which implies:

sqrt(b) ≤ s ≤ sqrt(b^2 - 1)

But sqrt(b^2 - 1) is just a bit less than b. So, s can range from ceil(sqrt(b)) up to floor(sqrt(b^2 - 1)).

Wait, but sqrt(b^2 - 1) is less than b, so the maximum integer s is b - 1, because (b - 1)^2 = b^2 - 2b + 1, which is less than b^2 - 1 for b > 2. Hmm, let me see:

For example, if b=10, then the maximum two-digit number is 99, so s^2 must be ≤99, so s can be up to 9 (since 10^2=100>99). So, indeed, s can be from ceil(sqrt(b)) up to b - 1.

Wait, but when b=2,
