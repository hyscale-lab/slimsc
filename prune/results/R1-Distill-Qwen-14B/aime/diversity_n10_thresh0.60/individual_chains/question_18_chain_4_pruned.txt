Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the number of rectangles that can be formed inside a regular dodecagon. Each side of the rectangle must lie on either a side or a diagonal of the dodecagon. Hmm, that's a bit tricky, but I think I can break it down.

First, I remember that a regular dodecagon has 12 sides, all equal in length, and all internal angles are equal too. Since it's regular, it's also convex, which probably helps because all the vertices are on a circle.

Now, the problem is about rectangles. Rectangles have opposite sides equal and four right angles. In a regular dodecagon, the sides and diagonals can form various lengths and angles. So, I need to figure out how these sides and diagonals can form rectangles.

Wait, but how are the sides and diagonals arranged? I think in a regular polygon, the diagonals can be classified by how many vertices they skip. For a dodecagon, each vertex is connected to 9 other vertices (since it's not connected to itself and its two adjacent vertices). So, the diagonals can be of different lengths, depending on how many vertices they skip.

Let me think. In a regular n-gon, the number of distinct diagonals is n(n-3)/2. For n=12, that would be 12*(12-3)/2= 12*9/2=54. So, 54 diagonals. But wait, that might include sides as well? No, no, sides are the edges connecting adjacent vertices, so sides aren't considered diagonals. So, the total number of diagonals is 54, and the number of sides is 12. So, in total, there are 66 lines (12 sides +54 diagonals). But in our problem, sides and diagonals are considered for forming the rectangle's sides.

But how do these diagonals and sides form rectangles? I think each rectangle is determined by choosing two pairs of parallel sides, each pair lying on diagonals or sides of the dodecagon.

Wait, in a regular dodecagon, sides and diagonals can be parallel. So, for a rectangle to exist, we need two pairs of parallel lines, each pair can be sides or diagonals, and they intersect to form four right angles.

I think a key here is that the sides of the rectangle must be
