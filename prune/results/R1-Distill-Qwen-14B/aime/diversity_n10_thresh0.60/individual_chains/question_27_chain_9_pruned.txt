Okay, so I have this problem about a torus inside and outside a sphere, and I need to find the difference between the radii of the circles where they are tangent. Hmm, let me try to visualize this.

First, the torus T is created by rotating a circle of radius 3 around an axis in its plane, and the distance from the center of the circle to the axis is 6. So, I remember that a torus can be thought of as a surface of revolution, right? The shape is like a donut, as mentioned. So, the major radius (the distance from the center of the generating circle to the axis) is 6, and the minor radius is 3.

Now, there's a sphere S with radius 11. The torus rests on the inside of S and is internally tangent along a circle with radius r_i. When it rests on the outside, it's externally tangent along a circle with radius r_o. I need to find r_i - r_o and express it as a fraction m/n, then find m + n.

Let me think about the internal tangent case first. When the torus is inside the sphere, the sphere's surface just touches the torus along a circle. Similarly, when it's outside, the sphere touches the torus externally along another circle.

I'm recalling that when two surfaces are tangent, their normals at the point of tangency are the same. But since we're dealing with circles of tangency, maybe I can model this in 3D.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the centers of these tangent circles. For the internal tangent, the torus is inside the sphere, so the center of the sphere and the center of the generating circle of the torus must lie along the same line. Similarly for the external case.

Let me try to model the torus mathematically. The standard equation for a torus with major radius R and minor radius r is:

(√(x² + y²) - R)² + z² = r².

In this case, R is 6, and r is 3. So the equation is:

(√(x² + y²) - 6)² + z² = 9.

Now, the sphere S has radius 11, so its equation is:

x² + y² + z² = 11² = 121.

When the torus is inside the sphere and tangent, the closest point on the torus to the origin should lie on the sphere. Similarly, when the torus is outside, the farthest point on the torus should lie on the sphere.

Wait, maybe that's not exactly correct. Let's think again. When the torus is inside the sphere, the sphere contains the torus, and they are tangent at one circle. So, for internal tangency, the torus touches the sphere along a circle, which lies on some plane. Similarly, for external tangency, the sphere and torus touch along another circle.

Alternatively, perhaps the centers of these tangent circles lie along the axis of the torus, which is the same as the axis of the sphere (since the sphere is symmetric). So, maybe the line connecting the centers of the sphere and the torus
