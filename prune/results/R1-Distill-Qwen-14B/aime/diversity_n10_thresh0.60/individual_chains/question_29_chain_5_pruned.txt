Alright, so I've got this geometry problem here, and I need to find the length of CE. Let me try to visualize it first.

Okay, there are two rectangles: ABCD and EFGH. Points D, E, C, F are collinear. Also, points A, D, H, G lie on a circle. Hmm, that's interesting. So, maybe some cyclic quadrilateral properties will come into play here.

Given lengths: BC is 16, AB is 107, FG is 17, and EF is 184. I need to find CE.

First, let me sketch this out mentally. Since ABCD is a rectangle, opposite sides are equal and all angles are right angles. Similarly, EFGH is a rectangle, so its sides are also equal and at right angles.

Let's note down the sides of each rectangle:
- Rectangle ABCD: AB = 107 (which is the length), BC = 16 (the width).
- Rectangle EFGH: EF = 184 (length), FG = 17 (width).

Wait, in a rectangle, adjacent sides are the length and the width. So for ABCD, AB and BC are adjacent sides, meaning AB is 107, BC is 16. So, AB is the length, BC is the width.

Similarly, for EFGH, EF is 184, FG is 17. So EF is the length, FG is the width.

Now, the points D, E, C, F are collinear. That means they lie on a straight line in the order D-E-C-F or some permutation of that? Hmm, not sure, but I'll need to figure that out.

Also, points A, D, H, G lie on a circle. That's a key piece of information. Since A, D, H, G are on a circle, they form a cyclic quadrilateral. So, perhaps I can use properties of cyclic quadrilaterals here.

Let me think about the positions of these points.

First, let me label the rectangles with their coordinates to get a better idea. Maybe coordinate geometry can help here.

Let's place rectangle ABCD in a coordinate system. Let's say point D is at the origin (0,0). Since ABCD is a rectangle, moving from D to C would be along the x-axis by BC = 16 units, so point C is at (16,0). Then, moving up from D to A would be along the y-axis by AB = 107 units, so point A is at (0,107). Point B would then be at (16,107).

Wait, but is that the correct orientation? Wait, in a rectangle ABCD, the points are in order, so the sides are AB, BC, CD, DA. So, if D is at (0,0), then C is at (16,0), B is at (16,107), and A is at (0,107). Yeah, that makes sense.

Now, rectangle EFGH. Since EFGH is another rectangle, let me try to place it such that points D, E, C, F are collinear.

Wait, point D is
