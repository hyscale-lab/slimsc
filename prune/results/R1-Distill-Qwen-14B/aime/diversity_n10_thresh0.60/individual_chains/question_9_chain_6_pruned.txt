Okay, so I have this math problem here where I need to find the product of two numbers x and y, both greater than 1. The problem states that log base x of y^x is equal to 10, and log base y of x^{4y} is also equal to 10. Hmm, okay. Let me try to parse this step by step.

First, I remember that logarithms can be tricky, but I also know some properties that might help. Maybe I can convert these logarithmic equations into exponential form, which might make them easier to handle.

So, the first equation is log_x(y^x) = 10. I know that log_b(a) = c is equivalent to b^c = a. So applying that here, it should mean that x^10 = y^x. That's the first equation in exponential form: x^10 = y^x.

Similarly, the second equation is log_y(x^{4y}) = 10. Using the same property, that should mean y^10 = x^{4y}. So now I have two equations:

1. x^10 = y^x
2. y^10 = x^{4y}

Hmm, okay. Now I have a system of two equations with two variables. Maybe I can solve for one variable in terms of the other and substitute.

Looking at the first equation: x^10 = y^x. I can take the natural logarithm of both sides to make it easier to handle exponents. Taking ln, I get:

ln(x^10) = ln(y^x)

Which simplifies to:

10 * ln(x) = x * ln(y)

Similarly, for the second equation: y^10 = x^{4y}

Taking ln of both sides:

ln(y^10) = ln(x^{4y})

Which simplifies to:

10 * ln(y) = 4y * ln(x)

Okay, so now I have two equations:

1. 10 * ln(x) = x * ln(y) → Equation A
2. 10 * ln(y) = 4y * ln(x) → Equation B

Hmm, perhaps I can express ln(y) from Equation A and substitute into Equation B.

From Equation A: 10 * ln(x) = x * ln(y)
So, ln(y) = (10 / x) * ln(x) → Equation C

Now plug Equation C into Equation B:

10 * [(10 / x) * ln(x)] = 4y * ln(x)

Simplify the left side:

100 / x * ln(x) = 4y * ln(x)

Assuming ln(x) is not zero (which it isn't since x > 1), we can divide both sides by ln(x):

100 / x = 4y

So, 4y = 100 / x → y = (100 / x) / 4 → y = 25 / x

Alright, so y is 25 over x. That's helpful. Let me note that down: y = 25/x.

Now, I can substitute this back into one of the earlier equations to solve for x. Let's go back to Equation A:

10 * ln(x) = x * ln(y)

But since y = 25/x, ln(y) = ln(25/x) = ln(25) - ln(x).

So substituting y into Equation A:

10 * ln(x) = x * [ln(25) - ln(x)]

Let me write that out:

10 ln x = x (ln25 - ln x)

Expanding the right-hand side:

10 ln x = x ln25 - x ln x

Let me bring all terms to one side to see if I can collect like terms:

10 ln x + x ln x - x ln25 = 0

Factor ln x from the first two terms:

ln x (10 + x) - x ln25 = 0

Hmm, that's:

ln x (10 + x) = x ln25

Wait, maybe I can write this as:

ln x = [x ln25] / (10 + x)

Alternatively, perhaps I can express this in terms of exponents. Let me think.

Alternatively, maybe I can substitute y =25/x into the first equation x^10 = y^x.

So, x^10 = y^x → x^10 = (25/x)^x

Let me write that as:

x^10 = (25^x) / (x^x)

Multiplying both sides by x^x to eliminate the denominator:

x^{10 + x} = 25^x

Hmm, okay. So:

x^{x +10} = 25^x

I can write both sides with base x or base 25, but perhaps taking logarithms again would help.

Taking natural log on both sides:

(x +10) ln x = x ln25

Which is:

(x +10) ln x = x ln25

Let me rearrange this:

(x +10) ln x - x ln25 = 0

Hmm, this looks similar to the equation I had earlier. Let me see:

Wait, earlier I had:

ln x (10 + x) = x ln25 → which is the same as (x +10) ln x = x ln25

So, same equation. So, perhaps I can solve for ln x in terms of x:

ln x = [x ln25] / (x +
