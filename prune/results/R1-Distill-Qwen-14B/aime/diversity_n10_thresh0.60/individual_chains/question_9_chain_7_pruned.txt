Okay, so I've got this problem here. It says that there are real numbers x and y, both greater than 1, such that log base x of y^x equals 10, and log base y of x^{4y} also equals 10. I need to find the product xy.

Hmm, logarithms can sometimes be tricky, but maybe if I break them down using logarithm properties, it'll make more sense.

First, let me write down the given equations:

1. log_x(y^x) = 10
2. log_y(x^{4y}) = 10

I remember that log_b(a^c) = c * log_b(a). So, applying that property to both equations.

For the first equation, log_x(y^x) becomes x * log_x(y) = 10.

Similarly, the second equation, log_y(x^{4y}) becomes 4y * log_y(x) = 10.

So now I have:

1. x * log_x(y) = 10
2. 4y * log_y(x) = 10

Hmm, I also remember that log_b(a) = 1 / log_a(b). So, log_x(y) is equal to 1 / log_y(x). Let me denote log_x(y) as some variable to simplify things. Let's say, letâ€™s let a = log_x(y). Then, log_y(x) would be 1/a.

So substituting that into the equations:

1. x * a = 10
2. 4y * (1/a) = 10

So now I have two equations:

1. x * a = 10 --> equation (A)
2. (4y) / a = 10 --> equation (B)

I can solve for x and y in terms of a. Let's see, from equation (A), x = 10 / a.

From equation (B), 4y = 10a --> y = (10a) / 4 = (5a)/2.

So now I have x and y in terms of a:

x = 10 / a
y = (5a) / 2

But I also know that a = log_x(y). So let's plug these expressions for x and y back into that.

So, a = log_x(y) = log_{10/a} (5a/2)

Hmm, that seems a bit complicated, but maybe I can use the change of base formula for logarithms. The change of base formula says that log_b(c) = log(c)/log(b), where the base can be anything, usually base 10 or base e.

So, let's compute log_{10/a}(5a/2) using natural logs for simplicity.

log_{10/a}(5a/2) = ln(5a/2) / ln(10/a)

So, a = [ln(5a/2)] / [ln(10/a)]

Hmm, this looks like an equation in terms of a that I need to solve.

Let me write that out:

a = [ln(5a/2)] / [ln(10/a)]

This looks a bit intimidating, but maybe I can simplify it. Let me consider cross-multiplying to get rid of the denominator.

a * ln(10/a) = ln(5a/2)

Let me denote t = a to make it less confusing. So,

t * ln(10/t) = ln(5t/2)

Let me expand the left side:

t * [ln(10) - ln(t)] = ln(5t/2)

So,

t * ln(10) - t * ln(t) = ln(5t/2)

Let me bring all terms to one side:

t * ln(10) - t * ln(t) - ln(5t/2) = 0

Hmm, this is a transcendental equation, which might be difficult to solve algebraically. Maybe I can find a substitution or make an intelligent guess for t.

Alternatively, perhaps I can express everything in terms of ln(2), ln(5), and ln(10), but I'm not sure.

Wait, let me see if I can manipulate it more. Let me write the equation again:

t * ln(10) - t * ln(t) - ln(5t/2) = 0

Let me separate the logarithm terms:

t * ln(10) - t * ln(t) - [ln(5) + ln(t) - ln(2)] = 0

Wait, because ln(5t/2) = ln(5) + ln(t) - ln(2).

So substituting that in:

t * ln(10) - t * ln(t) - ln(5) - ln(t) + ln(2) = 0

Now, let's collect like terms. Terms with ln(t):

(-t * ln(t) - ln(t)) = - (t + 1) ln(t)

Other terms:

t * ln(10) - ln(5) + ln(2)

So the equation is:

- (t + 1) ln(t) + t * ln(10) - ln(5) + ln(2) = 0

Hmm, this is still complicated. Maybe I can factor some parts.

Wait, ln(10) is ln(2*5) = ln(2) + ln(5). So, t * ln(10) = t*(ln(2) + ln(5)).

Let me substitute that:

- (t + 1)
