Okay, so I have this problem here where I need to find the remainder when the product from k=0 to 12 of (2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k}) is divided by 1000. ω is a 13th root of unity, and it's not equal to 1. Hmm, okay. Let me try to break this down.

First, I remember that roots of unity have some nice properties, especially when it comes to polynomials. Since ω is a primitive 13th root of unity, it satisfies the equation ω^13 = 1, and the minimal polynomial is the 13th cyclotomic polynomial, which is Φ₁₃(x) = x¹² + x¹¹ + ... + x + 1. But I'm not sure yet how this connects.

The product given is over k from 0 to 12, but since ω^k cycles through all the 13th roots of unity as k goes from 0 to 12, maybe I can reindex or find a pattern. Wait, but when k=0, ω^0 = 1, so the term becomes 2 - 2*1 + 1 = 1. So the first term is 1, which might simplify things a bit.

But let's see for other k. For k=1, the term is 2 - 2ω + ω². Hmm, I wonder if there's a way to express this product in terms of polynomials evaluated at certain points.

Wait, the product is over (2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k}) for each k. Maybe I can write this as a product over (2 - 2ω^k + (ω^k)^2). Let me set z = ω^k, then each term becomes 2 - 2z + z². So the product is the product from z being all 13th roots of unity (except z=1 for k=0, but wait, when k=0, z=1). Wait, no, k goes from 0 to 12, so z does take 1 as one of the roots. So the product is over all 13th roots of unity, including 1.

So the product is
