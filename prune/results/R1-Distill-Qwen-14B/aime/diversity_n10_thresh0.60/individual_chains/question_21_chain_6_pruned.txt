Okay, so I'm trying to solve this problem where I need to find the least integer base b (where b is at least 2) such that there are more than ten b-eautiful numbers. 

First, let me make sure I understand the problem correctly. A number n is called b-eautiful if when written in base b, it has exactly two digits. Also, the sum of these two digits should equal the square root of n. The example given is that 81 is 13-eautiful because when you write 81 in base 13, it's 63_13, and 6 + 3 equals 9, which is the square root of 81.

So, to break it down, for a number n to be b-eautiful, two conditions must hold:
1. When n is written in base b, it has exactly two digits. That means in base b, n is represented as "ab" where a and b are digits in base b. But wait, actually, the digits are from 0 to b-1, and since it's a two-digit number, the first digit a can't be zero. So, a is between 1 and b-1, and the second digit can be between 0 and b-1.

2. The sum of the two digits, a + c (wait, no, wait, the digits are usually called digits, but in this case, the problem refers to them as two digits. So, more precisely, if n is written as "dc" in base b, then d + c = sqrt(n). 

Wait, but in the problem statement, the example uses 6 and 3, which add up to 9, which is sqrt(81). So n in base b is a two-digit number, and the digits add up to sqrt(n). 

So, n has to satisfy two things: 

- It must be a two-digit number in base b, which means n = d * b + c, where d is the first digit (1 ≤ d ≤ b-1) and c is the second digit (0 ≤ c ≤ b-1).

- The sum of the digits, d + c, must equal sqrt(n). 

So, putting it together, for each base b, we can look for all pairs (d, c) where d is from 1 to b-1, c is from 0 to b-1, compute n = d*b + c, check if sqrt(n) is an integer (since d + c must equal sqrt(n)), and if so, then n is b-eautiful.

But wait, sqrt(n) must be an integer because d and c are integers, so their sum is an integer. So n must be a perfect square. So, n is a perfect square, and its base b representation is a two-digit number with digits d and c, and d + c = sqrt(n).

So, let's formalize this:

Given a base b, a number n is b-eautiful if:

1. n is a two-digit number in base b, which means n = d*b + c, where 1 ≤ d ≤ b-1, 0 ≤ c ≤ b-1.

2. sqrt(n
