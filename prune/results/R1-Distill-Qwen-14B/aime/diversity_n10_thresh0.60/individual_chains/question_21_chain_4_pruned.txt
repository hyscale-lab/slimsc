Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the least integer base b (where b is at least 2) such that there are more than ten b-eautiful integers. A number n is called b-eautiful if it has exactly two digits in base b, and the sum of these two digits equals the square root of n.

Let me start by understanding the problem better. When a number n is expressed in base b, having exactly two digits means that it can be written as n = a * b + c, where a and c are digits in base b. Since it's a two-digit number, the first digit a must be at least 1 and less than b (so 1 ≤ a ≤ b-1), and the second digit c must be between 0 and b-1 (so 0 ≤ c ≤ b-1).

The condition for being b-eautiful is that the sum of the digits a + c equals the square root of n. So, mathematically, that's:

a + c = √(a * b + c)

Hmm, let me square both sides to eliminate the square root:

(a + c)^2 = a * b + c

Expanding the left side:

a² + 2ac + c² = a b + c

Let me rearrange this equation to bring all terms to one side:

a² + 2ac + c² - a b - c = 0

Hmm, maybe I can factor this or express it in terms of a or c. Let me see if I can collect like terms. Let's group terms with a and c:

a² + (2c - b) a + (c² - c) = 0

This is a quadratic equation in terms of a. So for each c, we can solve for a, but since a and c are digits, they have to be integers within specific ranges.

Alternatively, maybe I can think of this equation as a quadratic in c as well. Let me try that:

Looking back at the equation:

a² + 2ac + c² - a b - c = 0

Let me write it as:

c² + (2a - 1) c + (a² - a b) = 0

So this is a quadratic in c. For each a, we can solve for c.

But since a and c are digits in base b, they are integers with a ≥ 1, c ≥ 0, and a ≤ b - 1, c ≤ b - 1.

So, perhaps for each base b, I can iterate over possible a and c values, check if the equation holds, and count how many such numbers exist. Then, find the smallest b where this count exceeds 10.

But since I need to find the minimal b where there are more than ten b-eautiful numbers, maybe I can find a general form or pattern to find how many solutions exist for a given b.

Let me try to approach this differently.

From the equation:

a + c = sqrt(n) where n = a*b + c.

So, n = (a + c)^2.

But n is also equal to a*b + c.

Therefore, we have:

(a + c)^2 = a*b + c

Let me expand (a + c)^2:

a² + 2ac + c² = a b + c

Rearranging:

a² + 2ac + c² - a b - c = 0

Hmm, same as before. Let me think about possible substitutions or ways to express b.

Let me try to solve for b. From the equation:

a² + 2ac + c² = a b + c

So, a b = a² + 2ac + c² - c

Thus,

b = (a² + 2ac + c² - c) / a

Simplify numerator:

a² + 2ac + c² - c = a² + 2ac + c² - c = a² + 2ac + c(c - 1)

Hmm, not sure if that helps. Let me factor out terms:

= a(a + 2c) + c(c - 1)

Still not very helpful. Alternatively, perhaps factor as:

= a² + 2ac + c² - c = (a + c)^2 - c

Wait, that's true because (a + c)^2 = a² + 2ac + c², so (a + c)^2 - c = a² + 2ac + c² - c.

So, then:

b = [(a + c)^2 - c] / a

Which is:

b = ( (a + c)^2 - c ) / a

Let me denote s = a + c, so s is the square root of n, and n is s².

Then,

b = (s² - c)/a
