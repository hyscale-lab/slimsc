Alright, so I've got this problem here that I need to solve. It's about finding the number of triples of nonnegative integers (a, b, c) that satisfy two conditions:

1. a + b + c = 300
2. a²b + a²c + b²a + b²c + c²a + c²b = 6,000,000

Hmm, okay. Let me try to figure this out step by step.

First, let me write down what I know. I have two equations involving a, b, and c. The first is a linear equation, and the second is a bit more complicated, a quadratic equation in each variable. My goal is to find all triples (a, b, c) where each is a nonnegative integer, so they can be zero or positive integers.

I think I should start by trying to simplify or manipulate the given equations to find a relationship between a, b, and c.

The first equation is straightforward:
a + b + c = 300

The second equation is a bit more complex:
a²b + a²c + b²a + b²c + c²a + c²b = 6,000,000

Looking at the second equation, I can try to factor it. Let's see:

I notice that each term has two variables multiplied together, with one of them squared. For example, a²b and a²c both have a squared and multiplied by b and c, respectively. Similarly, the other terms are like that. So maybe I can factor out a², b², and c².

Wait, let me write it out:

a²b + a²c = a²(b + c)
Similarly, b²a + b²c = b²(a + c)
And c²a + c²b = c²(a + b)

So, the entire expression can be written as:
a²(b + c) + b²(a + c) + c²(a + b) = 6,000,000

Hmm, that seems a bit better. Now, I can substitute (b + c) from the first equation, since a + b + c = 300. So, b + c = 300 - a.

Similarly, a + c = 300 - b, and a + b = 300 - c.

So substituting these into the equation:

a²(300 - a) + b²(300 - b) + c²(300 - c) = 6,000,000

Let me expand each term:

a²(300 - a) = 300a² - a³
b²(300 - b) = 300b² - b³
c²(300 - c) = 300c² - c³

So the equation becomes:
(300a² - a³) + (300b² - b³) + (300c² - c³) = 6,000,000

Which can be rewritten as:
300(a² + b² + c²) - (a³ + b³ + c³) = 6,000,000

Hmm, okay. Maybe I can find another way to write this. Alternatively, perhaps I can find a relationship between a, b, and c.

Wait, another approach: perhaps express everything in terms of symmetric sums. Let me recall that for variables a, b, c, the elementary symmetric sums are:

s1 = a + b + c = 300
s2 = ab + ac + bc
s3 = abc

But I'm not sure if I can express the given equation in terms of these.

Let me see. The equation is:

a²b + a²c + b²a + b²c + c²a + c²b = 6,000,000

I can factor this as ab(a + b) + ac(a + c) + bc(b + c). Wait, let's see:

ab(a + b) = a²b + ab²
ac(a + c) = a²c + ac²
bc(b + c) = b²c + bc²

So indeed, the given expression is equal to ab(a + b) + ac(a + c) + bc(b + c). So the whole expression is:

ab(a + b) + ac(a + c) + bc(b + c) = 6,000,000

Hmm, perhaps I can express this
