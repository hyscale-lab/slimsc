Okay, so I've got this geometry problem here. Let me try to visualize it and figure out what's going on. 

We have two rectangles, ABCD and EFGH. The points D, E, C, F are collinear. Hmm, that means they all lie on a straight line. Also, points A, D, H, G all lie on a circle. Interesting. So those four points are concyclic, meaning they form a cyclic quadrilateral. 

The given lengths are BC = 16, AB = 107, FG = 17, and EF = 184. We need to find the length of CE.

Let me start by drawing a rough sketch. So, rectangle ABCD. Let's say it's positioned with AB as the base, BC as the height. So, points A, B, C, D would form a rectangle where AB is 107 units, BC is 16 units. Then, rectangle EFGH is somehow connected such that D, E, C, F are on a straight line. Also, A, D, H, G lie on a circle.

Wait, so let me note that in rectangle ABCD, opposite sides are equal and all angles are right angles. So AB = CD = 107, BC = AD = 16. Similarly, in rectangle EFGH, EF = GH = 184, FG = EH =17.

Since D, E, C, F are collinear, I think the line goes through points D, E, C, F in that order, maybe? Or perhaps another order? Let me think. Since D is a corner of ABCD, and C is the opposite corner, so DC is a diagonal of rectangle ABCD. Wait, but in a rectangle, the diagonals are equal and bisect each other, but they aren't necessarily straight lines through other points. Wait, but in this case, D, E, C, F are collinear, so the line passes through D, then E, then C, then F.

So, the line DC is extended beyond C to point E and beyond D to point F. Hmm. Wait, but that might not make sense because in the rectangles ABCD and EFGH, DC is a side of ABCD, but FG is a side of EFGH.

Wait, maybe I should draw the rectangles such that their sides are aligned in a way that allows D, E, C, F to be collinear. Let me try to imagine the positions.

Suppose rectangle ABCD has AB = 107 and BC = 16. So, if I place point A at the origin (0,0), then B would be at (107, 0), C at (107,16), and D at (0,16). Now, rectangle EFGH has EF = 184 and FG =17. So, EF is a horizontal side of length 184 and FG is a vertical side of length 17.

But how are EFGH and ABCD positioned? Points D, E, C, F are collinear. So, if D is at (0,16) and C is at (107,16), the line DC is the line y=16, from x=0 to x=107. So, points E and F must lie on this line y=16.

Wait, but EF is a side of rectangle EFGH, which has length 184. So, EF is a horizontal line segment of length 184. Since E and F are on y=16, that makes sense. So, if E is at (x,16) and F is at (x+184,16), but wait, EF is a side of the rectangle, which is probably placed such that EF is horizontal and FG is vertical. So, the rectangle EFGH would have sides EF and FG. So, from E, moving to F (right along y=16, then up or down to G, then to H, and back to E.

But wait, F is another point on the line DC. So, in this case, since D is at (0,16) and C is at (107,16), the line DC is from x=0 to x=107 on y=16. So, E and F must lie on this line, but beyond C and D perhaps?

Wait, maybe E is beyond C, and F is beyond D? Because otherwise, if E and F are between D and C, then EF would be a segment within DC, but EF is 184, which is longer than DC (107). So, EF can't be on DC, because DC is only 107 long.

Wait, so DC is 107 units, EF is 184, which is longer. So, points E and F must lie on the line passing through DC but extended beyond C and D.

So, the line DC is along y=16, from D(0,16) to C(107,16). So, if we extend this line beyond C, we can place E, and beyond D, we can place F.

So, E is at (107 + t, 16) for some t>0, and F is at (0 - s,16) for some s>0.

But EF is 184. So, the distance between E and F is 184. Since they're both on y=16, the distance is just the difference in x-coordinates.

So, E is at (107 + t,16), F is at (-s,16). Then, the distance from E to F is (107 + t) - (-s) = 107 + t + s = 184.

So, t + s = 184 -107 = 77.

Hmm, okay. So, t + s =77. I'll keep that in mind.

Now, the other condition is that points A, D, H, G lie on a circle. So, rectangle EFGH has points E, F, G, H. Since it's a rectangle, the sides are at right angles, so FG is 17, which is vertical.

Since EF is along y=16, from E(107 + t,16) to F(-s,16), then FG is vertical. So, from F(-s,16), G is at (-s,16 +17) = (-s,33). Similarly, from E(107 + t,16), moving vertically to H, which would be at (107 + t, 16 +17) = (107 + t,33).

Wait, but in that case, the rectangle EFGH would have points E, F, G, H with coordinates E(x,16), F(x',16), G(x',16+17), H(x,16+17). So, the rectangle is sitting on the line y=16, extending up to y=33.

So, points G and H would be at (F's x, 33) and (E's x,33), respectively.

Now, the points A, D, H, G are concyclic, meaning they lie on a circle.

Point A is at (0,0), D is at (0,16), H is at (107 + t,33), and G is at (-s,33).

Wait, so A is (0,0), D is (0,16), H is (h,33), G is (g,33). So, these four points lie on a circle.

Hmm, okay. Let me think about the circle passing through these four points.

Four points lie on a circle if the determinant of their coordinates in the general circle equation is zero. Alternatively, since three points define a circle, the fourth must satisfy the equation.

Alternatively, maybe we can find the equation of the circle passing through A, D, H, G and set up the equation.

Let me first write the coordinates:

A: (0,0)

D: (0,16)

H: (107 + t,33)

G: (-s,33)

So, we can find the equation of the circle passing through A, D, and H, then verify that G lies on it.

The general equation of a circle is x^2 + y^2 + 2gx + 2fy + c =0.

Since point A (0,0) is on the circle, plugging in, we get 0 +0 +0 +0 +c=0 => c=0.

So the equation becomes x^2 + y^2 + 2gx + 2fy =0.

Now, plugging in point D (0,16):

0 + (16)^2 + 0 + 2f(16) =0 => 256 +32f=0 => 32f= -256 => f= -8.

So now the equation is x^2 + y^2 + 2gx -16y =0.

Now, plugging in point H (107 + t,33):

(107 + t)^2 + (33)^2 + 2g(107 + t) -16*(33) =0.

Let me compute that:

(107 + t)^2 + 1089 + 2g(107 + t) -528 =0.

Simplify:

(107 + t)^2 + 561 + 2g(107 + t) =0.

So, (107 + t)^2 + 2g(107 + t) +561 =0.

Similarly, point G (-s,33) is also on the circle, so plugging in:

(-s)^2 + (33)^2 + 2g*(-s) -16*(33) =0.

Which is s^2 + 1089 -2gs -528=0.

Simplify:

s^2 -2gs + 561=0.

So, now we have two equations:

1) (107 + t)^2 + 2g(107 + t) +561 =0.

2) s^2 -2gs +561=0.

Hmm, we can solve equation 2 for g.

From equation 2:

s^2 -2gs +561=0 => -2gs = -s^2 -561 => g = (s^2 +561)/(2s).

Similarly, equation 1:

(107 + t)^2 + 2g(107 + t) +561 =0.

Substituting g from equation 2 into equation 1:

(107 + t)^2 + 2*( (s^2 +561)/(2s) )*(107 + t) +561=0.

Simplify:

(107 + t)^2 + ( (s^2 +561)/s )*(107 + t) +561=0.

Let me let u =107 + t, so equation becomes:

u^2 + ( (s^2 +561)/s ) *u +561=0.

Multiply both sides by s to eliminate denominator:

s*u^2 + (s^2 +561)u +561 s =0.

So, s*u^2 + (s^2 +561) u +561 s =0.

Hmm, that's a quadratic in u.

Let me write it as:

s u^2 + (s^2 +561) u +561 s =0.

We can factor this equation:

Let me see, maybe s u^2 + s^2 u +561 u +561 s =0.

Factor terms:

s u^2 + s^2 u = s u (u + s)

561 u +561 s =561 (u + s)

So, the equation becomes:

s u (u + s) + 561 (u + s )=0.

Factor out (u + s):

(u + s)(s u +561 )=0.

So, either u + s =0, or s u +561=0.

Case 1: u +s=0.

But u =107 + t, so 107 + t + s=0.

But earlier, we had t + s=77.

So, 107 + t + s=107 +77=184≠0. So this case is impossible.

Case 2: s u +561=0.

But u =107 + t, s u = -561.

So, s (107 + t )= -561.

But earlier, t + s=77. So, t=77 -s.

So, substituting into s (107 + t )= -561:

s (107 + 77 -s )= -561.

Simplify inside the brackets:

107 +77=184, so 184 - s.

So, s (184 - s ) = -561.

Which is 184 s - s^2 = -561.

Bring all terms to one side:

s^2 -184 s -561=0.

Wait, solving quadratic equation:

s^2 -184 s -561=0.

Wait, that seems a bit messy. Let me compute discriminant:

D= (184)^2 +4*561= 33856 + 2244= 36100.

Square root of 36100 is 190.

So, s= [184 ±190]/2.

So, two solutions:

s=(184 +190)/2= 374/2=187,

s=(184 -190)/2= (-6)/2= -3.

But s was defined as the distance beyond D, so s>0. So, s=187.

So, s=187.

Then, since t + s=77,

t=77 -187= -110.

Wait, t is negative. Hmm, t was defined as the extension beyond C, right? So, t= -110 would imply that E is not beyond C but on the other side, past D?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the direction.

Earlier, I assumed E is at (107 + t,16) and F is at (-s,16). So, if t is negative, E would be at (107 + t,16) which is to the left of C. Similarly, s is positive, so F is at (-187,16).

But if t is negative, then E is on the side towards D, and F is way to the left.

But perhaps that's acceptable. Let's see.

So, with s=187, t=77-187= -110.

So, E is at x=107 + (-110)= -3, y=16.

So, E is at (-3,16).

F is at (-s,16)= (-187,16).

So, EF is from (-187,16) to (-3,16), which is a distance of 184, as given. So that checks out.

Now, the rectangle EFGH has sides EF and FG. So, from E(-3,16), moving to F(-187,16), then to G(-187,16 +17)= (-187,33), then to H(-3,33), and back to E.

So, the rectangle EFGH has its top side at y=33, from x=-187 to x=-3.

Now, back to the circle passing through A(0,0), D(0,16), H(-3,33), G(-187,33).

Wait, earlier I thought H was at (107 + t,33)=( -3,33), which is correct.

So, the four points on the circle are A(0,0), D(0,16), H(-3,33), G(-187,33).

We can find the equation of the circle passing through these points.

Earlier, we had the equation:

x^2 + y^2 + 2gx -16y =0.

From point H(-3,33):

(-3)^2 + (33)^2 + 2g*(-3) -16*(33)=0.

Compute each term:

9 + 1089 -6g -528 =0.

Sum up:

9 + 1089=1098; 1098 -528=570.

So, 570 -6g=0 => 6g=570 => g=95.

So, the equation is x^2 + y^2 + 190x -16y =0.

Wait, 2g=190, so g=95.

So, equation is x^2 + y^2 +190x -16y=0.

Let me check if point G(-187,33) lies on this circle.

Plug in x=-187, y=33:

(-187)^2 + (33)^2 +190*(-187) -16*(33)=?

Compute each term:

187^2: 187*187. Let me compute 200^2=40000, minus 13*200*2= 5200, plus 13^2=169.

Wait, 187=200-13. So, (200-13)^2=200^2 - 2*200*13 +13^2=40000 -5200 +169= 34969.

So, (-187)^2=34969.

33^2=1089.

190*(-187)= -190*187. Let me compute 200*187=37400. So, 190*187= (200-10)*187= 37400 -1870=35530. So, -190*187= -35530.

-16*33= -528.

So, putting it all together:

34969 +1089 -35530 -528.

Compute step by step:

34969 +1089=36058.

36058 -35530=528.

528 -528=0.

So, yes, it satisfies the equation. So, point G is on the circle. So that checks out.

So, now we have all the points:

A(0,0), D(0,16), C(107,16), E(-3,16), F(-187,16), G(-187,33), H(-3,33).

Now, we need to find the length of CE.

Point C is at (107,16), and point E is at (-3,16).

So, they are both on the line y=16.

So, the distance between C(107,16) and E(-3,16) is |107 - (-3)|=110.

Wait, so CE is 110 units long.

But wait, let me confirm. The coordinates of C are (107,16), E is (-3,16). So, the distance is sqrt( (107 - (-3))^2 + (16 -16)^2 )= sqrt(110^2 +0)=110.

So, CE=110.

Wait, but the problem statement says that D, E, C, F are collinear. So, in our setup, E is at (-3,16), D is at (0,16), C at (107,16), F at (-187,16). So, indeed, they lie on the straight line y=16.

So, CE is 107 - (-3)=110.

So, the length of CE is 110.

Hmm, so that's the answer.


To solve the problem, we analyze the given rectangles and their properties. We are given two rectangles, $ABCD$ and $EFGH$, with $D, E, C, F$ collinear on the line $y=16$. Additionally, points $A, D, H, G$ lie on a circle. The dimensions provided are $BC=16$, $AB=107$, $FG=17$, and $EF=184$. We aim to find the length of $CE$.

1. **Positioning the Rectangles**:
   - Rectangle $ABCD$ has $AB=107$ and $BC=16$, so its coordinates are $A(0,0)$, $B(107,0)$, $C(107,16)$, and $D(0,16)$.
   - Rectangle $EFGH$ has $EF=184$ and $FG=17$. Since $D, E, C, F$ are collinear on $y=16$, we place $E$ and $F$ on this line.

2. **Determining Coordinates of $E$ and $F$**:
   - Let $E$ be at $(107 + t, 16)$ and $F$ at $(-s, 16)$. The distance $EF=184$ gives $t + s = 77$.

3. **Circle Passing Through $A, D, H, G$**:
   - Points $A(0,0)$, $D(0,16)$, $H(107 + t, 33)$, and $G(-s, 33)$ lie on a circle. Using the circle equation and substituting these points, we derive:
     - For $A$: $c = 0$.
     - For $D$: $f = -8$.
     - For $H$ and $G$: Solving the resulting equations, we find $s = 187$ and $t = -110$.

4. **Coordinates of $E$ and $F$**:
   - Substituting $s = 187$ and $t = -110$, we get $E(-3, 16)$ and $F(-187, 16)$.

5. **Calculating $CE$**:
   - Points $C(107,16)$ and $E(-3,16)$ lie on the line $y=16$. The distance $CE$ is:
     \[
     CE = |107 - (-3)| = 110
     \]

Thus, the length of $CE$ is $\boxed{110}$.
