Okay, so I've got this geometry problem here, and I need to find the length of CE. Let me try to visualize the problem first because the description is a bit complex. 

We have two rectangles, ABCD and EFGH. The points D, E, C, F are collinear. That means they all lie on a straight line. Also, points A, D, H, G all lie on a circle. That's interesting because if four points lie on a circle, they must be concyclic, which might give me some properties to work with.

Given lengths are BC = 16, AB = 107, FG = 17, and EF = 184. I need to find CE. Let me jot down the given information:

- ABCD is a rectangle, so all angles are 90 degrees, and opposite sides are equal. So, BC = AD = 16, and AB = CD = 107.
- EFGH is another rectangle, so EF = GH = 184, FG = EH = 17.
- Points D, E, C, F are collinear. So, they lie on a straight line in that order or some other order? Hmm, the order matters for figuring out distances. Let me think.
- A, D, H, G lie on a circle. So, quadrilateral ADHG is cyclic.

I need to find CE. Let me try to draw a rough sketch in my mind. Let's consider rectangle ABCD with AB = 107 and BC = 16. So, AB is the base, 107 units long, and BC is the height, 16 units. Then, rectangle EFGH is another rectangle. Points D, E, C, F are collinear. Hmm, so D is a corner of rectangle ABCD, and E is a corner of EFGH. Similarly, C is another corner of ABCD, and F is a corner of EFGH.

Since D, E, C, F are collinear, the line passes through D, then E, then C, then F? Or is it some other order? Maybe D-E-F-C or D-C-E-F? Wait, the order isn't specified, but since ABCD and EFGH are rectangles, their sides are connected in some way.

Wait, maybe I need to figure out the positions based on the collinearity. Let me consider that line D-E-C-F is a straight line. So, D is one point, then E, then C, then F. So, the points are arranged as D---E---C---F on a straight line.

Wait, but if ABCD is a rectangle, then C is opposite to A, so if D is on one corner, then C is the next corner. Similarly, for EFGH, E is a corner, and F is the adjacent corner. So, perhaps E and F are adjacent in EFGH, which would make sense because EF is a side with length 184.

So, now, if D, E, C, F are collinear, and EF is 184, then the distance from E to F is 184. But since E and F are on the same line as D and C,
