Okay, I'm trying to solve this geometry problem. Let me read it again carefully.

We have triangle ABC inscribed in a circle ω. The tangents to ω at B and C meet at point D. The line AD intersects ω again at point P. We're given the lengths AB=5, BC=9, and AC=10. We need to find AP expressed as a reduced fraction m/n and compute m + n.

Hmm, so first, I should probably sketch a diagram to visualize everything. But since there's an Asymptote figure provided, I can imagine it: triangle ABC with the circumcircle ω. The tangents at B and C meet at D, so D is the ex-pole of BC? Or maybe D is the exsimilicenter or something related to the tangents.

Wait, tangents from a common external point are equal. So, DB = DC because they're both tangents from D to ω. That makes triangle DBC an isosceles triangle with DB = DC.

Let me recall some important theorems related to circles and tangents. There's the power of a point, which might be useful here. The power of point D with respect to ω is DB² = DC² = (distance from D to center)^2 - radius², but maybe I don't need that yet.

Since AD intersects ω again at P, AP is a chord of the circle passing through A and P.

I remember that when two chords intersect, the products of the segments are equal. But here, AD is a secant, but I'm not sure where it intersects another chord. Maybe I can apply the Power of a Point theorem at point A. Wait, but A is on the circle, so its power is zero. That might not help.

Alternatively, maybe use Power of a Point at D. Since D lies outside the circle ω, its power is equal to DB² (since DB and DC are both tangents). So, Power of D: DB² = DP * DA.

Yes, that seems right. Because AD is a secant line intersecting the circle at A and P, so Power of D gives DB² = DP * DA.

So, if I can find DB, I can relate DP and DA. But to find DB, I need more information about the triangle or the circle.

Given the sides AB=5, BC=9, and AC=10, maybe I can compute some properties of triangle ABC, like its circumradius, area, or coordinates of the points. That might help.

Let me try to compute the circumradius of triangle ABC. The formula for the circumradius R is (a*b*c)/(4*Δ), where a, b, c are the sides, and Δ is the area.

First, I need to find the area of triangle ABC. Using Heron's formula: s = (a + b + c)/2 = (5 + 9 + 10)/2 = (24)/2 = 12.

Then, Δ = sqrt[s(s - a)(s - b)(s - c)] = sqrt[12*(12-5)*(12-9)*(12-10)] = sqrt[12*7*3*2] = sqrt[504] = sqrt[16*31.5] = Wait, 504 factors into 16 * 31.5? Hmm, perhaps better to factor 504:

504 = 16 * 31.5? Wait, 16 * 31.5 is 504? Let me compute 16 * 30 = 480, 16 * 31.5 = 504, yes. But 504 can be factored as 16*31.5, but 31.5 is 63/2, which is not helpful for exact sqrt. Alternatively, 504 = 72 * 7, and sqrt(72*7
