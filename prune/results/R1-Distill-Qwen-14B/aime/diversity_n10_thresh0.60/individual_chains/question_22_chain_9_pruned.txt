Okay, so I have this problem about a convex equilateral hexagon where all pairs of opposite sides are parallel. The hexagon is labeled ABCDEF. Then, there's a triangle formed by extending the sides AB, CD, and EF, and the sides of this triangle are 200, 240, and 300. I need to find the side length of the hexagon.

Hmm, let me start by visualizing this. A convex hexagon with opposite sides parallel and all sides equal. That's interesting. So it's like a regular hexagon in terms of side lengths but maybe not in angles because it's not regular necessarily. But it's convex, so all internal angles are less than 180 degrees.

Since all pairs of opposite sides are parallel, I can think of the hexagon as being made by translating each side by some distance, maintaining the parallelism. Maybe it's similar to a regular hexagon but scaled or something?

Wait, but how does the triangle formed by extending AB, CD, and EF come into play? Let me try to sketch this mentally. If I extend AB, CD, and EF, they form a triangle. The sides of this triangle are 200, 240, and 300. So, perhaps this triangle is larger than the hexagon and the hexagon is inscribed within it in some way.

I remember that in such cases, there's a relationship between the sides of the triangle and the side lengths of the hexagon. Maybe similar triangles? Or some proportion.

Let me think about the properties of the hexagon. Since it's equilateral and opposite sides are parallel, it's called a "parallel equilateral hexagon." I think there's a theorem related to this. Oh right, in such a hexagon, the sides are all equal, opposite sides are parallel, and the triangle formed by extending three alternate sides (like AB, CD, EF) relates to the hexagon's side length in some ratio.

I think the key here is that the sides of the triangle are proportional to the side of the hexagon and some scaling factor based on how the hexagon fits into the triangle.

Wait, perhaps using similar triangles. Let me denote the side length of the hexagon as 's'. Then, if I look at the triangle formed by the extensions, each side of that triangle is made up of two segments: one from the hexagon and one extension beyond it.

Wait, maybe the triangle is formed by three lines each extended from a side of the hexagon. So, for example, extending AB beyond B, CD beyond D, and EF beyond F, these three lines meet to form a triangle. Each side of this triangle would be composed of two parts: the side of the hexagon and some extension.

But since all sides of the hexagon are equal, maybe each side of the triangle can be expressed in terms of 's' and some multiple.

Alternatively, perhaps using vectors or coordinate geometry. Let me try to assign coordinates to the hexagon.

Let me set point A at (0,0). Since the hexagon is convex and equilateral with opposite sides parallel, I can assign vectors to each side.

But this might get complicated. Maybe there's a better approach. I remember that for a convex equilateral hexagon with opposite sides parallel, the hexagon can be thought of as being formed by three pairs of parallel sides, each pair separated by some distance.

Each pair of opposite sides can be considered as two sides of a parallelogram. So, the hexagon can be thought of as a combination of three parallelograms?

Alternatively, perhaps the triangle formed by the extensions is similar to the triangle formed by the sides of the hexagon. Wait, but the triangle has sides 200, 240, 300. Maybe the hexagon is similar but scaled down.

Wait, but how? Let me think. If I consider the triangle formed by AB, CD, EF, then each side of this triangle is longer than the corresponding side of the hexagon by some multiple.

Wait, perhaps the triangle has sides that are each a multiple of the hexagon's side length. Let me denote the triangle sides as a = 200, b = 240, c = 300, and
