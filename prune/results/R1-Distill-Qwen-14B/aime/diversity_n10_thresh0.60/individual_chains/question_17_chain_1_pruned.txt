Okay, so I have this problem about rectangular boxes with a given surface area and volume, and I need to find the radius of the smallest sphere that can contain any of these boxes. Then, I have to express r squared as a fraction p/q and find p + q. Hmm, okay, let's break this down.

First, let me note down what's given:

- The set B consists of rectangular boxes.
- Each box has a surface area of 54.
- Each box has a volume of 23.
- We need to find the radius r of the smallest sphere that can contain any box from B.
- Then, compute r² and express it as p/q with p and q coprime, and find p + q.

Alright, so I think the key here is to find the maximum possible space diagonal of any box in set B because the sphere must enclose the box, so the diameter of the sphere must be at least the space diagonal of the box. Therefore, the radius is half of that diagonal.

So, the first step is to model the problem mathematically.

Let the dimensions of the rectangular box be x, y, z. They are positive real numbers.

Given:
1. Surface area = 54.
   The surface area of a rectangular box is 2(xy + yz + zx) = 54.

2. Volume = 23.
   The volume is xyz = 23.

We need to find the maximum possible space diagonal, which is sqrt(x² + y² + z²). Because the sphere must contain the box, the sphere's diameter must be at least the space diagonal, so the radius is half of that. Therefore, the minimal sphere radius is half the maximum space diagonal among all boxes in B.

So, our goal is to maximize sqrt(x² + y² + z²), given the constraints:

1. 2(xy + yz + zx) = 54 => xy + yz + zx = 27.
2. xyz = 23.

I think the strategy here is to use Lagrange multipliers to maximize x² + y² + z² given the constraints. Alternatively, maybe we can express variables in terms of each other and use substitution.

Wait, but maybe another approach is to use the method of symmetric variables because the problem is symmetric in x, y, z. So, perhaps the maximum occurs when x = y = z? But wait, wait, no. If x = y = z, then the box is a cube. Let me check if such a cube exists with surface area 54 and volume 23.

For a cube, surface area is 6x² = 54 => x² = 9 => x = 3. Then volume would be 3³ = 27. But our volume is 23, which is less than 27. So, the cube with surface area 54 has volume 27, which is larger than 23. Therefore, our boxes will have volume 23, which is less than 27, so perhaps the dimensions are unequal.

So, the box isn't a cube, so the maximum space diagonal might not occur at the cube. Hmm, so the maximum space diagonal probably occurs
