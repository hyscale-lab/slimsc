Okay, so I've got this math problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again:

Find the largest possible real part of \[(75 + 117i)z + \frac{96 + 144i}{z}\] where \( z \) is a complex number with \( |z| = 4 \). 

Hmm, okay. So, \( z \) is a complex number, and its magnitude is 4. I need to find the maximum value of the real part of this expression. Let's break this down.

First, let me recall that any complex number \( z \) can be written in polar form as \( z = re^{i\theta} \), where \( r \) is the modulus (which is 4 in this case) and \( \theta \) is the argument (angle). So, \( z = 4e^{i\theta} \). That might make things easier to work with, especially since we're dealing with exponents and reciprocals.

Let me write \( z = 4e^{i\theta} \). Then, \( \frac{1}{z} = \frac{1}{4}e^{-i\theta} \) because the reciprocal of \( e^{i\theta} \) is \( e^{-i\theta} \).

So, substituting into the original expression:

\[ (75 + 117i)z + \frac{96 + 144i}{z} = (75 + 117i)(4e^{i\theta}) + \frac{96 + 144i}{4}e^{-i\theta} \]

Let me compute each term separately.

First term: \( (75 + 117i)(4e^{i\theta}) \).

Let's compute \( 75*4 = 300 \) and \( 117*4 = 468 \). So, this term becomes \( 300 + 468i \) multiplied by \( e^{i\theta} \). 

So, \( (300 + 468i)e^{i\theta} \).

Similarly, the second term is \( \frac{96 + 144i}{4}e^{-i\theta} \). Compute \( 96/4=24 \) and \( 144/4=36 \). So, this becomes \( 24 + 36i \) multiplied by \( e^{-i\theta} \).

So, \( (24 + 36i)e^{-i\theta} \).

Now, let me write both terms:

1. \( (300 + 468i)e^{i\theta} \)
2. \( (24 + 36i)e^{-i\theta} \)

I need to add these two terms together and find the real part of the sum. Then, I have to find the maximum of that real part as \( \theta \) varies.

Let me denote \( A = 300 + 468i \) and \( B = 24 + 36i \). So, the expression becomes \( A e^{i\theta} + B e^{-i\theta} \).

I know that for a complex number \( C e^{i\theta} + D e^{-i\theta} \), the real part can be found by taking the real part of each term and adding them. Alternatively, I can express each term in terms of sine and cosine to find the real part.

Let me express both terms in terms of cosine and sine.

First, \( A e^{i\theta} = (300 + 468i)(\cos\theta + i\sin\theta) \).

Let me multiply this out:

\( 300 \cos\theta + 300 i \sin\theta + 468i \cos\theta + 468i^2 \sin\theta \).

Since \( i^2 = -1 \), this simplifies to:

\( 300 \cos\theta + (300 \sin\theta + 468 \cos\theta)i - 468 \sin\theta \).

So, the real part from the first term is \( 300 \cos\theta - 468 \sin\theta \).

Similarly, the imaginary part is \( 300 \sin\theta + 468 \cos\theta \), but since we're only interested in the real part of the entire expression, maybe I can focus just on the real parts from both terms.

Now, let's compute the real part of the second term \( B e^{-i\theta} = (24 + 36i)(\cos\theta - i\sin\theta) \).

Multiplying this out:

\( 24 \cos\theta - 24 i \sin\theta + 36i \cos\theta - 36i^2 \sin\theta \).

Again, \( i^2 = -1 \), so this becomes:

\( 24 \cos\theta + ( -24 \sin\theta + 36 \cos\theta )i + 36 \sin\theta \).

So, the real part is \( 24 \cos\theta + 36 \sin\theta \).

Therefore, combining the real parts from both terms, the total real part \( Re \) is:

\( [300 \cos\theta - 468 \sin\theta] + [24 \cos\theta + 36 \sin\theta] \).

Let me combine like terms:

- The cosine terms: \( 300 \cos\theta + 24 \cos\theta = 324 \cos\theta \).
- The sine terms: \( -468 \sin\theta + 36 \sin\theta = -432 \sin\theta \).

So, \( Re = 324 \cos\theta - 432 \sin\theta \).

Now, I need to find the maximum value of \( Re = 324 \cos\theta - 432 \sin\theta \) as \( \theta \) varies from 0 to \( 2\pi \).

I remember that expressions of the form \( a \cos\theta + b \sin\theta \) can be rewritten as \( R \cos(\theta + \phi) \) where \( R = \sqrt{a^2 + b^2} \) and \( \phi \) is some phase shift. The maximum value of this expression is then \( R \), because the maximum of cosine is 1.

Wait, but in our case, the expression is \( 324 \cos\theta - 432 \sin\theta \). Hmm, so that's similar to \( a \cos\theta + b \sin\theta \), but with a minus sign. So, it's \( a \cos\theta + (-b) \sin\theta \).

So, let me compute \( R = \sqrt{a^2 + b^2} \) where \( a = 324 \) and \( b = 432 \) (but since it's negative, the sign will be handled in the phase angle).

Wait, no, because the formula for \( R \) is based on the coefficients, regardless of their signs. So, \( a = 324 \), \( b = -432 \) perhaps? Or wait, in the standard form \( a \cos\theta + b \sin\theta \), so in our case, \( a = 324 \), \( b = -432 \).

Wait no, no, in the standard formula, the expression is \( a \cos\theta + b \sin\theta \). So, in our case, it's \( 324 \cos\theta - 432 \sin\theta \), so \( a = 324 \), \( b = -432 \).

But in the formula, \( R = \sqrt{a^2 + b^2} \), regardless of signs. So, R is the square root of (324^2 + (-432)^2).

Let me compute that.

First, compute 324 squared. 324 is 18^2, so 324^2 = (18^2)^2 = 18^4? Wait, no, that's not correct. Wait, 324 is 18^2, so 324 squared is (18^2)^2 = 18^4. Let me compute 18^2 = 324, so 18^4 = 324^2 = let me compute 324*324.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to compute 324^2 as (300 + 24)^2 = 300^2 + 2*300*24 + 24^2 = 90,000 + 14,400 + 576 = 90,000 + 14,400 is 104,400, plus 576 is 104,976.

Similarly, 432 squared: let's compute that.

432^2 = (400 + 32)^2 = 400^2 + 2*400*32 + 32^2 = 160,000 + 25,600 + 1,024. Let's add them up: 160,000 + 25,600 = 185,600; 185,600 + 1,024 = 186,624.

But wait, in our case, b is -432, but when we square it, the negative goes away. So, R is sqrt(324^2 + (-432)^2) = sqrt(104,976 + 186,624).

Adding 104,976 and 186,624: 104,976 + 186,624.

Let me do that:

104,976 + 186,624:

100,000 + 180,000 = 280,000

4,976 + 6,624 = 11,600

So total is 280,000 + 11,600 = 291,600.

So, R = sqrt(291,600). Let me compute sqrt(291600).

I know that sqrt(291600) is sqrt(2916 * 100) = sqrt(2916) * 10.

What is sqrt(2916)? Well, 50^2 is 2500, 54^2 is 2916 because 54*54: 50*50=2500, 50*4=200, 4*50=200, 4*4=16. So, 54^2 = (50+4)^2=2500 + 400 + 16=2916. So, sqrt(2916) is 54.

Therefore, sqrt(291600) = 54 * 10 = 540.

So, R = 540.

Therefore, the expression \( 324 \cos\theta - 432 \sin\theta \) can be written as \( 540 \cos(\theta + \phi) \), where \( \phi \) is some phase shift. Since the maximum value of cosine is 1, the maximum value of the real part is 540.

Wait, but hold on, let me make sure. Because when you have \( a \cos\theta + b \sin\theta = R \cos(\theta - \phi) \), where \( R = \sqrt{a^2 + b^2} \) and \( \phi = \arctan(b/a) \). But in this case, our expression is \( a \cos\theta + b \sin\theta \) with a = 324, b = -432.

So, to be precise, \( 324 \cos\theta - 432 \sin\theta = R \cos(\theta + \phi) \), where \( R = 540 \), and \( \phi \) is such that:

cos\phi = a/R = 324/540, and sin\phi = -b/R = 432/540.

Wait, let me see:

Wait, the standard identity is \( a \cos\theta + b \sin\theta = R \cos(\theta - \phi) \), where \( R = \sqrt{a^2 + b^2} \), and \( \phi = \arctan(b/a) \).

But in our case, the expression is \( 324 \cos\theta + (-432) \sin\theta \). So, it's \( a \cos\theta + b \sin\theta \) with a = 324 and b = -432.

So, using the identity, this is equal to \( R \cos(\theta - \phi) \), where \( R = \sqrt{a^2 + b^2} = 540 \), and \( \phi = \arctan(b/a) = \arctan(-432/324) \).

Simplify -432/324: both are divisible by 108. 432 ÷ 108 = 4, 324 ÷108=3. So, -432/324 = -4/3.

So, \( \phi = \arctan(-4/3) \). Since arctangent returns values between -π/2 and π/2, this will give a negative angle. But in terms of the cosine function, adding a negative angle is the same as subtracting a positive angle.

But regardless, since we're looking for the maximum value of \( R \cos(\theta - \phi) \), the maximum occurs when \( \cos(\theta - \phi) = 1 \), which is when \( \theta = \phi \). Therefore, the maximum value is R, which is 540.

So, the maximum real part of the given expression is 540. Therefore, the answer should be 540.

Wait, but let me double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.

1. Expressed z as 4e^{iθ}, which is correct because |z|=4.

2. Substituted into the expression, correctly computing (75+117i)*4 as 300 + 468i, and (96+144i)/4 as 24 +36i.

3. Expressed each term as A e^{iθ} and B e^{-iθ}, with A=300+468i and B=24+36i.

4. Expanded each term to find their real parts, which led to 324 cosθ - 432 sinθ.

5. Recognized that to find the maximum of this expression, it's equivalent to R cos(θ + φ), where R is sqrt(324^2 + 432^2)=540.

6. Concluded that the maximum real part is 540.

Hmm, all steps seem correct. Let me just verify the calculation of 324^2 and 432^2.

324^2: 300^2=90,000; 24^2=576; 2*300*24=14,400. So, 90,000 + 14,400 + 576 = 104,976. Correct.

432^2: 400^2=160,000; 32^2=1,024; 2*400*32=25,600. So, 160,000 + 25,600 + 1,024 = 186,624. Correct.

Sum: 104,976 + 186,624 = 291,600. Square root is 540. Correct.

So, yes, the maximum real part is 540. I think that's the correct answer.


To find the largest possible real part of the expression \[(75 + 117i)z + \frac{96 + 144i}{z}\] where \( z \) is a complex number with \( |z| = 4 \), we proceed as follows:

1. Express \( z \) in polar form: \( z = 4e^{i\theta} \).
2. Substitute into the expression:
   \[
   (75 + 117i)z + \frac{96 + 144i}{z} = (300 + 468i)e^{i\theta} + (24 + 36i)e^{-i\theta}.
   \]
3. Expand and separate real parts:
   \[
   \text{Real part} = 324 \cos\theta - 432 \sin\theta.
   \]
4. Recognize the expression as \( a \cos\theta + b \sin\theta \) with \( a = 324 \) and \( b = -432 \).
5. Compute \( R = \sqrt{a^2 + b^2} = \sqrt{324^2 + 432^2} = 540 \).
6. The maximum real part is \( R = 540 \).

Thus, the largest possible real part is \(\boxed{540}\).
