Okay, so I'm trying to solve this problem where there are four points A, B, C, and D on the hyperbola given by the equation x²/20 - y²/24 = 1. These points form a rhombus ABCD, and the diagonals of this rhombus intersect at the origin. I need to find the greatest real number that is less than BD² for all such rhombi. Hmm, okay, let's break this down.

First, I remember that a rhombus is a quadrilateral with all sides equal, and the diagonals bisect each other at right angles. Wait, no, actually, in a rhombus, the diagonals bisect each other and bisect the angles, but they aren't necessarily perpendicular unless it's a square. Wait, no, actually, I think in a rhombus, the diagonals are not necessarily perpendicular. Wait, no, wait, no, correction: In a rhombus, the diagonals are perpendicular. Yes, that's right. So in a rhombus, the diagonals bisect each other at right angles.

But in this case, the diagonals intersect at the origin, which is the center of the hyperbola. So, the origin is the midpoint of both diagonals. That makes sense because the hyperbola is symmetric about the origin.

So, since the diagonals intersect at the origin, each diagonal is symmetric about the origin. So, if point A is (x, y), then the opposite point C must be (-x, -y). Similarly, points B and D must be symmetric with respect to the origin as well, so if B is (p, q), then D is (-p, -q).

Wait, but in a rhombus, the diagonals are perpendicular bisectors of each other. So, maybe the diagonals are AC and BD, and they intersect at the origin. So, points A and C are endpoints of one diagonal, and B and D are endpoints of the other diagonal.

Since all four points lie on the hyperbola, we have:

For point A: x²/20 - y²/24 = 1.
For point B: p²/20 - q²/24 = 1.
Similarly for points C and D, but since C is (-x, -y) and D is (-p, -q), they'll satisfy the same equation, so they're already accounted for.

Now, since ABC
