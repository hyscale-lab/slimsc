Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the number of triples of nonnegative integers (a, b, c) such that a + b + c = 300 and a²b + a²c + b²a + b²c + c²a + c²b = 6,000,000. Hmm, that looks a bit complicated, but let me break it down.

First, the equation a + b + c = 300. That's straightforward; it's a linear equation with three variables. The second equation is a bit more complex: a²b + a²c + b²a + b²c + c²a + c²b = 6,000,000. Hmm, I can see that each term is a product of a square of one variable and another variable. Maybe I can factor this somehow.

Let me write the second equation differently. Notice that each term is of the form x²y, where x and y are different variables. So, grouping them:

a²b + a²c = a²(b + c)
Similarly, b²a + b²c = b²(a + c)
And c²a + c²b = c²(a + b)

So, the entire expression can be written as:
a²(b + c) + b²(a + c) + c²(a + b) = 6,000,000

Hmm, that's a bit cleaner. Now, since a + b + c = 300, I can express (b + c) as (300 - a), right? Because b + c = 300 - a. Similarly, (a + c) = 300 - b and (a + b) = 300 - c.

So substituting these into the equation:

a²(300 - a) + b²(300 - b) + c²(300 - c) = 6,000,000.

Let me expand each term:

a² * 300 - a³ + b² * 300 - b³ + c² * 300 - c³ = 6,000,000.

Factor out the 300:

300(a² + b² + c²) - (a³ + b³ + c³) = 6,000,000.

Hmm, okay. So 300(a² + b² + c²) - (a³ + b³ + c³) = 6,000,000.

I wonder if there's a way to relate a² + b² + c² and a³ + b³ + c³ using the given condition a + b + c = 300.

I remember that (a + b + c)^2 = a² + b² + c² + 2(ab + bc + ca). So, since a + b + c = 300, then:

300² = a² + b² + c² + 2(ab + bc + ca)
Which means 90,000 = (a² + b² + c²) + 2(ab + bc + ca)

Hmm, but I don't know ab + bc + ca yet. Maybe I can find another relation. Let me think.

Wait, maybe I can also recall that a³ + b³ + c³ = (a + b + c)^3 - 3(a + b + c)(ab + bc + ca) + 3abc.

So, a³ + b³ + c³ = 300³ - 3*300*(ab + bc + ca) + 3abc.

Calculating 300³: 300*300 = 90,000, then 90,000*300 = 27,000,000. So,

a³ + b³ + c³ = 27,000,000 - 900*(ab + bc + ca) + 3abc.

Hmm, let's substitute this back into the earlier equation.

From before, 300(a² + b² + c²) - (a³ + b³ + c³) = 6,000,000.

Plugging in the expression for a³ + b³ + c³:

300(a² + b² + c²) - [27,000,000 - 900(ab + bc + ca) + 3abc] = 6,000,000.

Simplify this:

300(a² + b² + c²) - 27,000,000 + 900(ab + bc + ca) - 3abc = 6,000,000.

Let me move the 27,000,000 to the right side:

300(a² + b² + c²) + 900(ab + bc + ca) - 3abc = 6,000,000 + 27,000,000.

Which is 300(a² + b² + c²) + 900(ab + bc + ca) - 3abc = 33,000,000.

Hmm, that's a lot. Maybe I can factor out a 3:

3[100(a² + b² + c²) + 300(ab + bc + ca) - abc] = 33,000,000.

Divide both sides by 3:

100(a² + b² + c²) + 300(ab + bc + ca) - abc = 11,000,000.

Hmm, that's still complicated. Let me see if I can express a² + b² + c² in terms of ab + bc + ca.

Earlier, I had 90,000 = a² + b² + c² + 2(ab + bc + ca). So, a² + b² + c² = 90,000 - 2(ab + bc + ca).

Let me substitute this into the equation:

100*(90,000 - 2(ab + bc + ca)) + 300(ab + bc + ca) - abc = 11,000,000.

Compute 100*90,000 = 9,000,000. 100*(-2)(ab + bc + ca) is -200(ab + bc + ca).

So,

9,000,000 - 200(ab + bc + ca) + 300(ab + bc + ca) - abc = 11,000,000.

Combine like terms:

9,000,000 + 100(ab + bc + ca) - abc = 11,000,000.

Subtract 9,000,000 from both sides:

100(ab + bc + ca) - abc = 2,000,000.

Hmm, this simplifies things. So now we have:

100(ab + bc + ca) - abc = 2,000,000.

Let me write that as:

ab + bc + ca - (abc)/100 = 20,000.

Wait, that might not be helpful. Alternatively, perhaps factor out ab:

ab(100 - c) + bc + ca = 2,000,000.

Wait, maybe not. Alternatively, perhaps express in terms of common variables.

Alternatively, maybe factor the equation:

100(ab + bc + ca) - abc = 2,000,000.

We can factor out ab:

ab(100 - c) + bc + ca = 2,000,000.

Wait, not sure. Alternatively, let's consider that 100(ab + bc + ca) - abc = 2,000,000.

Hmm, perhaps factor out 100:

100(ab + bc + ca) = abc + 2,000,000.

So,

abc = 100(ab + bc + ca) - 2,000
