Okay, so Alice and Bob are playing a game with a stack of n tokens. They take turns removing either 1 or 4 tokens. The person who takes the last token wins. I need to figure out how many positive integers n ≤ 2024 allow Bob to have a winning strategy, no matter how Alice plays.

Hmm, let's break this down. It's a turn-based game with perfect information, so it's similar to other impartial games like Nim. The key is to determine for each n whether the starting player (Alice) can force a win, or if the second player (Bob) can.

I think the best way to approach this is by using the concept of winning and losing positions. A position is a losing position if the player whose turn it is cannot force a win, assuming the opponent plays optimally. Conversely, a winning position allows the current player to force a win.

So, let's define the positions. Let's say P(n) is true if the current player can force a win with n tokens, and false otherwise. We need to find for which n P(n) is false because that's when Bob can win, given that Alice starts.

Base cases:
- P(0): Well, if there are 0 tokens, the game is over. So the current player can't make a move and thus loses. So P(0) is false.
- P(1): The current player can take 1 token and win. So P(1) is true.
- P(2): Current player takes 1 token, leaving 1 for the opponent who then takes it and wins. Wait, no—that's bad. Alternatively, maybe take 1 and leave 1, which is a winning position for the opponent. Wait, no, perhaps I should think in terms of P(n) being true if there's any move that leads the opponent to a losing position.

Wait, maybe I should consider each P(n) as true if the current player can make a move to a position where the opponent is in a losing position. So P(n) = not (P(n-1) and P(n-4)), but I'm not sure. Maybe it's the logical OR of the possible moves. Let me think.

Wait, correct approach: For a given n, if the current player can make a move (either subtract 1 or 4) leading to a position where the opponent cannot win, then P(n) is true. So P(n) is true if either P(n-1) is false or P(n-4) is false. Because if the current player can make a move to a position where the opponent is in a losing position, then the current player can win.

So, more formally:

P(n) = (not P(n-1)) or (not P(n-4)), but only if those moves are possible.

Wait, wait, perhaps more accurately, P(n) is true if there exists a move (i.e., subtract 1 or 4) such that the resulting position is a losing position for the opponent. So P(n) is true if either P(n-1) is false or P(n-4) is false, provided that n-1 ≥ 0 and n-4 ≥ 0.

So, let's lay out the initial conditions:

- P(0) = false (no move can be made; current player loses)
- For n <
