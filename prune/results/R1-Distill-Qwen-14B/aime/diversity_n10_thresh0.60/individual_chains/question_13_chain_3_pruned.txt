Okay, so I have this math problem to solve, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's see what it's about.

The problem says that Aya goes for a 9-kilometer walk every morning and stops at a coffee shop afterward. There are two scenarios given about her walking speed and the time it takes, including the time she spends in the coffee shop. I need to find out how long her walk takes when she walks at a speed of s + 1/2 km/h, including the coffee shop time.

Alright, let me read the problem again to make sure I get all the details.

When she walks at a constant speed of s km/h, the walk takes her 4 hours, including t minutes in the coffee shop. When she walks s + 2 km/h, the walk takes her 2 hours and 24 minutes, including t minutes in the coffee shop. I need to find the time when she walks at s + 1/2 km/h.

Hmm, so the key here is that the time given includes both the walking time and the coffee shop time (which is t minutes in both cases). So the total time is the walking time plus t minutes.

Wait, so if I denote the walking time as T, then the total time would be T + t. But in the problem, the total time is given as 4 hours and 2 hours 24 minutes, respectively. So, I can set up equations based on that.

Let me try to outline what I know.

First scenario:
- Speed: s km/h
- Total time: 4 hours
- This includes walking time plus coffee shop time (t minutes).

Wait, but 4 hours is a total time. So, let's convert t minutes into hours because the speed is in km/h. Since 1 hour is 60 minutes, t minutes is t/60 hours.

So, the total time is walking time + t/60 hours = 4 hours.

Similarly, in the second scenario:
- Speed: s + 2 km/h
- Total time: 2 hours 24 minutes. Let me convert that to hours. 24 minutes is 24/60 hours, which is 0.4 hours. So, total time is 2.4 hours.

Again, the total time is walking time + t/60 hours = 2.4 hours.

So, for both scenarios, I can write equations.

Let me denote the walking time as T. So:

First scenario:
T1 + (t/60) = 4 hours.

Second scenario:
T2 + (t/60) = 2.4 hours.

But the walking time T depends on the speed and the distance. Since the distance is constant at 9 km, I can write:

T1 = 9 / s
T2 = 9 / (s + 2)

So substituting into the first equation:

(9 / s) + (t/60) = 4

And the second equation:

(9 / (s + 2)) + (t/60) = 2.4

So now I have two equations with two variables: s and t. I can solve this system of equations to find s and t, and then use that information to find the time when she walks at s + 1/2 km/h.

Let me write down the equations again:

1) (9/s) + (t/60) = 4
2) (9/(s + 2)) + (t/60) = 2.4

Hmm, I notice that both equations have the same t/60 term. Maybe I can subtract one equation from the other to eliminate t.

Let's subtract equation 2 from equation 1:

[9/s + t/60] - [9/(s + 2) + t/60] = 4 - 2.4

Simplify this:

9/s - 9/(s + 2) = 1.6

So, 9/s - 9/(s + 2) = 1.6

Let me compute 9/s - 9/(s + 2). Let's factor out the 9:

9 [1/s - 1/(s + 2)] = 1.6

Compute the difference inside the brackets:

1/s - 1/(s + 2) = [ (s + 2) - s ] / [ s(s + 2) ) ] = 2 / [ s(s + 2) ]

So, 9 * [2 / (s(s + 2))] = 1.6

Which simplifies to:

18 / [s(s + 2)] = 1.6

Let me write that as:

18 / (s^2 + 2s) = 1.6

Now, let's solve for s^2 + 2s:

Multiply both sides by (s^2 + 2s):

18 = 1.6 (s^2 + 2s)

Divide both sides by 1.6 to make it easier:

18 / 1.6 = s^2 + 2s

Compute 18 / 1.6:

1.6 goes into 18 how many times? 1.6 * 11 = 17.6, which is close to 18. So, 11.25 times because 1.6 * 11.25 = 18. So,

18 / 1.6 = 11.25

So, s^2 + 2s = 11.25

Bring all terms to one side:

s^2 + 2s - 11.25 = 0

Now, this is a quadratic equation. Let's solve for s.

Quadratic equation: ax^2 + bx + c = 0

Here, a = 1, b = 2, c = -11.25

Using the quadratic formula:

s = [ -b ± sqrt(b^2 - 4ac) ] / (2a)

Compute discriminant D = b^2 - 4ac

D = (2)^2 - 4*1*(-11.25) = 4 + 45 = 49

So sqrt(D) = 7

So,

s = [ -2 ± 7 ] / 2

We have two solutions:

s = (-2 + 7
