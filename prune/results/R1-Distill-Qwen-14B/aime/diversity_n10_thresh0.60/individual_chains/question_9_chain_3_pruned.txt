Okay, so I've got this logarithm problem here. It says that there are real numbers x and y, both greater than 1, such that log base x of y^x is equal to 10, and log base y of x^{4y} is also equal to 10. I need to find the product xy. Hmm, okay, let's break this down step by step.

First, I remember that logarithms can be tricky, but they have certain properties that might help here. Let me write down what I know.

The first equation is log_x(y^x) = 10. I know that log_b(a^c) is equal to c*log_b(a), so I can rewrite this as x * log_x(y) = 10. Similarly, the second equation is log_y(x^{4y}) = 10, which I can also rewrite as 4y * log_y(x) = 10.

So now I have two equations:

1. x * log_x(y) = 10
2. 4y * log_y(x) = 10

Hmm, okay, so looking at these, I notice that log_x(y) and log_y(x) are reciprocals of each other. Because log_b(a) = 1 / log_a(b). So, if I let log_x(y) = k, then log_y(x) = 1/k.

Let me define that. Let k = log_x(y). Then, log_y(x) = 1/k.

Substituting into the equations:

1. x * k = 10
2. 4y * (1/k) = 10

Simplify the second equation: (4y)/k = 10 => 4y = 10k => y = (10k)/4 = (5k)/2.

So now I have expressions for x and y in terms of k. From the first equation, x = 10 / k.

So, x = 10/k and y = (5k)/2.

Now, since k is log_x(y), let's write that in terms of x and y.

k = log_x(y) = ln(y)/ln(x). Since x and y are both greater than 1, their natural logs are positive, so k is positive.

But we have x and y in terms of k. Let me plug those into the expression for k.

k = ln(y) / ln(x) = ln( (5k)/2 ) / ln(10/k )

Hmm, this looks a bit complicated, but maybe I can set up an equation here.

So,

k = [ln(5k/2)] / [ln(10/k)]

Let me write that as:

k = ln(5k/2) / ln(10/k)

Hmm, to solve for k, I might need to manipulate this equation. Let me cross-multiply to get rid of the fraction.

k * ln(10/k) = ln(5k/2)

Hmm, okay. Let me try to write this out:

k * [ln(10) - ln(k)] = ln(5k/2)

Expanding the left side:

k * ln(10) - k * ln(k) = ln(5k) - ln(2)

Wait, actually, ln(5k/2) is equal to ln(5k) - ln(2), because ln(a/b) = ln(a) - ln(b).

So, now the equation is:

k ln(10) - k ln(k) = ln(5k) - ln(2)

Let me expand ln(5k) as ln(5) + ln(k):

k ln(10) - k ln(k) = ln(5) + ln(k) - ln(2)

Let me collect like terms. Bring all terms to the left side:

k ln(10) - k ln(k) - ln(5) - ln(k) + ln(2) = 0

Combine the ln(k) terms:

k ln(10) - (k + 1) ln(k) - ln(5) + ln(2) = 0

Hmm, this seems complicated. Maybe I can factor or find a substitution. Let me see.

Alternatively, maybe instead of using natural logarithms, I can express everything in terms of log base 10 or another base, but I'm not sure yet.

Wait, perhaps there's another approach. Since x and y are related through these log equations, maybe I can find a relationship between x and y first, before substituting.

Let me think. We have x = 10/k and y = 5k/2.

So, let me express y in terms of x. Since x = 10/k, then k = 10 / x.

Substituting into y = 5k/2:

y = (5*(10/x)) / 2 = (50/x)/2 = 25/x.

So, y = 25/x.

Wait, that's a big relation. So y is 25 divided by x. So, we can write y = 25/x.

So, our variables are linked by y = 25/x. That might be helpful.

Let me see if I can use this in the definition of k. Remember that k = log_x(y) = log_x(25/x). Because y = 25/x.

So,

k = log_x(25/x) = log_x(25) - log_x(x) = log_x(25) - 1.

But log_x(25) can be written as ln(25
