Okay, so I have this math problem here. Let me try to understand it step by step. The problem says:

Let \( N \) be the greatest four-digit positive integer with the property that whenever one of its digits is changed to 1, the resulting number is divisible by 7. Then, \( Q \) and \( R \) are the quotient and remainder when \( N \) is divided by 1000. We need to find \( Q + R \).

Hmm. So, \( N \) is a four-digit number, meaning it's between 1000 and 9999. The key property is that if you change any one of its digits to 1, the new number is divisible by 7. We need to find the largest such \( N \), then compute \( Q + R \) where \( Q = \lfloor N / 1000 \rfloor \) and \( R = N \mod 1000 \).

Let me break it down. First, the structure of \( N \). Since it's a four-digit number, let's denote it as \( N = \overline{a b c d} \), where \( a, b, c, d \) are its digits, with \( a \) being the thousands digit, \( b \) the hundreds, \( c \) the tens, and \( d \) the units digit.

The condition is that changing any single digit to 1 gives a number divisible by 7. That means:

1. If I change the thousands digit \( a \) to 1, the number becomes \( \overline{1 b c d} \), and this must be divisible by 7.
2. If I change the hundreds digit \( b \) to 1, the number becomes \( \overline{a 1 c d} \), which must also be divisible by 7.
3. Similarly, changing \( c \) to 1 gives \( \overline{a b 1 d} \), which must be divisible by 7.
4. Finally, changing \( d \) to 1 gives \( \overline{a b c 1} \), which must be divisible by 7.

So, for each digit position, replacing it with 1 must result in a number divisible by 7. Our goal is to find the largest such \( N \), then compute \( Q + R \).

Since we need the greatest such four-digit number, we should start checking from 9999 downwards until we find a number satisfying the condition. But that might take a long time, so perhaps there's a smarter way.

Let me think about the implications of each condition.

Let's denote the original number as \( N = 1000a + 100b + 10c + d \).

When we change a digit to 1, the new number can be written as:

- Changing \( a \) to 1: \( N_a = 1000*1 + 100b + 10c + d = 1000 + 100b + 10c + d \)
- Changing \( b \) to 1: \( N_b = 1000a + 100*1 + 10c + d = 1000a + 100 + 10c + d \)
- Changing \( c \) to 1: \( N_c = 1000a + 100b + 10*1 + d = 1000a + 100b + 10 + d \)
- Changing \( d \) to 1: \( N_d = 1000a + 100b + 10c + 1 = 1000a + 100b + 10c + 1 \)

Each of these \( N_a, N_b, N_c, N_d \) must be divisible by 7.

So, we can write:

1. \( N_a \equiv 0 \mod 7 \)
2. \( N_b \equiv 0 \mod 7 \)
3. \( N_c \equiv 0 \mod 7 \)
4. \( N_d \equiv 0 \mod 7 \)

Let me express each of these in terms of \( N \):

- \( N_a = N - 1000a + 1000 \times 1 = N - 1000a + 1000 \)
Wait, maybe that's not the best approach. Alternatively, since \( N = 1000a + 100b +10c +d \), then \( N_a = 1000 + 100b +10c +d = N - 1000a + 1000 \times 1 \). Hmm, perhaps it's better to compute \( N_a \) as \( 1000 + 100b + 10c + d \), which is \( N - 1000a + 1000 \).

Similarly, \( N_b = 1000a + 100 + 10c + d = N - 100b + 100 \times 1 \), so \( N_b = N - 100b + 100 \).

Similarly for the others:

\( N_c = N - 10c + 10 \times 1 = N - 10c + 10 \)

\( N_d = N - d + 1 \times 1 = N - d + 1 \)

Each of these must be congruent to 0 mod 7.

So, let's write the congruencies:

1. \( N - 1000a + 1000 \equiv 0 \mod 7 \)
2. \( N - 100b + 100 \equiv 0 \mod 7 \)
3. \( N - 10c + 10 \equiv 0 \mod 7 \)
4. \( N - d + 1 \equiv 0 \mod 7 \)

Alternatively, we can write these as:

1. \( N \equiv 1000a - 1000 \mod 7 \)
2. \( N \equiv 100b - 100 \mod 7 \)
3. \( N \equiv 10c - 10 \mod 7 \)
4. \( N \equiv d - 1 \mod 7 \)

Wait, perhaps I should approach this differently. Let me think about what each condition implies about \( N \) modulo 7.

Let me denote \( N \) as \( N = 1000a + 100b + 10c + d
