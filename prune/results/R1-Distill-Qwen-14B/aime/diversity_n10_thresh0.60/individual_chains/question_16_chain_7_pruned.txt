Okay, so I've got this math problem here, and I need to find the least prime number p where there's a positive integer n such that n^4 + 1 is divisible by p squared. Then, I have to find the smallest positive integer m where m^4 +1 is divisible by p squared. Hmm, that sounds a bit tricky, but let me try to work through it step by step.

First, I remember that primes are numbers greater than 1 that have no positive divisors other than 1 and themselves. So, p is the smallest such prime with this property. The problem is asking for the least p, so I should probably start checking primes in order.

The first few primes are 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, etc. Let me think about each of these and see if there's a corresponding n where n^4 +1 is divisible by p squared.

Starting with p=2. Let's see, 2 squared is 4. So I need an n where n^4 +1 is divisible by 4. Let's try n=1: 1^4 +1 = 2, which isn't divisible by 4. n=2: 16 +1 =17, which isn't divisible by 4. n=3: 81+1=82, which is not divisible by 4. Wait, but 82 divided by 4 is 20.5, so no. Maybe n=0, but n has to be positive, so n=0 isn't allowed. Hmm, so p=2 doesn't seem to work because no n^4 +1 is divisible by 4. Or wait, maybe I'm missing something. Let me check n=1 again: 1 +1 = 2, which is 2 mod 4, so not divisible by 4. n=3: 81 is 1 mod 4, so 82 is 2 mod 4. n=5: 625+1=626, which is 2 mod 4. Hmmm, seems like for all odd n, n^4 is 1 mod 4, so n^4 +1 is 2 mod 4, which is not 0 mod 4. For even n, n^4 is 0 mod 4, so n^4 +1 is 1 mod 4. So, p=2 can't satisfy the condition because n^4 +1 is never 0 mod 4. So p=2 is out.

Next prime is p=3. Let's compute p squared, which is 9. So I need n^4 +1 ≡0 mod 9. Let me compute n^4 mod 9 for n=1 to 8 because of mod 9.

n=1: 1^4=1 → 1+1=2 mod9, not 0.
n=2: 16 →7 mod9, 7+1=8 mod9, not 0.
n=3: 81≡0 mod9, 0+1=1 mod9, nope.
n=4: 256 mod9. Wait, 4^4 is 256. Let's divide 256 by 9: 9*28=252, so 256-252=4. So 256≡4 mod9. 4+1=5 mod9, nope.
n=5: 5^4=625. 625 divided by 9: 9*69=621, so 625-621=4. So 625≡4 mod9. Then 4+1=5 mod9, same as above.
n=6: 6^4=1296. 1296 is 0 mod9, so 0+1=1 mod9.
n=7: 7^4=2401. 2401 divided by 9: 9*266=2394, so 2401-2394=7. 7+1=8 mod9.
n=8: 8^4=4096. 4096 mod9: let's compute 4096 /9. 9*455=4095, so 4096≡1 mod9. 1+1=2 mod9.
n=9: same as n=0, but n must be positive. So, 9 is 0 mod9, 0+1=1. Hmm, so in all cases, n^4 +1 mod9 is either 1,2,5,8. So it never reaches 0 mod9. Therefore, p=3 is also out.

Next prime is p=5. p squared is 25. I need to find n such that n^4 +1 ≡0 mod25. Let's try n=1:1+1=2 mod25. n=2:16+1=17 mod25. n=3:81+1=82 mod25. 25*3=75, 82-75=7, so 7 mod25. n=4:256 +1=257. 25*10=250, 257-250=7, so again 7 mod25. Wait, maybe I can compute
