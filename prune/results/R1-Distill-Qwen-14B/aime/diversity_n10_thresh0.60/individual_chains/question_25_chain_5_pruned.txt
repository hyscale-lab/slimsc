Okay, so I've got this problem to solve. Let me read through it again to make sure I understand what's being asked. 

There are 900 residents in Aimeville. Each of them owns a bag of candy hearts, which is one thing. Then, 195 own a diamond ring, 367 own a set of golf clubs, and 562 own a garden spade. So, four items in total: candy hearts (which everyone has), diamond ring, golf clubs, and garden spade. 

Now, the problem also says that 437 residents own exactly two of these things, and 234 own exactly three. The question is asking how many own all four of these items. 

Hmm, okay. So, this seems like a problem involving sets and their overlaps. I remember that for problems like this, the principle of inclusion-exclusion is useful. Let me recall how that works. 

Inclusion-exclusion principle is used to calculate the size of the union of multiple sets by adding up the sizes of individual sets, subtracting the sizes of all possible two-set intersections, adding back in the sizes of all possible three-set intersections, and so on. But in this case, we're given some specific numbers about exactly two and exactly three overlaps, so maybe that's a different approach.

Wait, I think I remember that when dealing with problems where you know the number of people with exactly two, exactly three, etc., you can use a formula that relates the total number of elements to these counts. 

Let me try to structure this. Let me denote:

- Total number of residents, N = 900.
- Let A be the set of people who own a diamond ring.
- Let B be the set of people who own a set of golf clubs.
- Let C be the set of people who own a garden spade.
- Let D be the set of people who own a bag of candy hearts. But wait, the problem says each resident owns a bag of candy hearts. So actually, D is the entire set of 900 residents because everyone has it. That might simplify things a bit.

Wait, so D is the universal set here. So, every resident is in D. So, when considering the other sets, they are subsets of D. So, the question is about the overlaps between A, B, C, and D, but since everyone is in D, maybe I don't need to consider D separately. Hmm, maybe not, but let me think.

The problem is about finding the number of residents who own all four items, which would be the intersection of A, B, C, and D. But since D is everyone, it's just the intersection of A, B, and C. Because owning all four is the same as owning A, B, C, and D, but since D is universal, it's just A ∩ B ∩ C.

Wait, but the problem is asking for all four, so that's correct. So, the number we’re looking for is |A ∩ B ∩ C|.

Wait, but let me think again. Because the problem says each resident owns a bag of candy hearts, so D is size 900. So, the four things they can own are A, B, C, and D. But since D is everyone, any combination that includes D is actually the same as just the other sets. But I'm not sure if that's complicating things. Maybe I should model it as four sets, with D being universal.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to model it as three sets because D is universal. So, the problem reduces to three sets (A, B, C) within the universal set D of 900. So, for the rest of the problem, maybe I can treat A, B, C as the only sets, and D is just the universe.

But let me think about the given numbers. The problem says 437 own exactly two of these things. So, exactly two of all four? Or exactly two of the three (A, B, C), since D is universal?

Wait, the problem says, "each of the 900 residents owns a bag of
