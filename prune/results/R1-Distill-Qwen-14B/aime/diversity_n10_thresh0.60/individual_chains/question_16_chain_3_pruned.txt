Okay, so I have this problem here. It says: Let p be the least prime number for which there exists a positive integer n such that n⁴ + 1 is divisible by p². Then I need to find the least positive integer m such that m⁴ + 1 is divisible by p².

Hmm, okay. So first, I need to find the smallest prime p where there's some n with n⁴ ≡ -1 mod p². Then, once I find that p, I have to find the smallest m that satisfies the same condition.

Wait, let me make sure I understand. So, p is the smallest prime such that n⁴ ≡ -1 mod p² has a solution. Then, once I have that p, find the minimal m where m⁴ ≡ -1 mod p².

Alright, let's start by considering small primes and see if any satisfy the condition that n⁴ ≡ -1 mod p² has a solution.

The primes in order are 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, etc. Let's check each one.

Starting with p=2.

For p=2, let's see if n⁴ + 1 is divisible by 2²=4.

n⁴ mod 4: Let's compute n⁴ for n=1,2,3, etc., mod 4.

n=1: 1⁴=1 mod4 → 1 +1=2≡2 mod4 → not divisible by 4.

n=2: 16 mod4=0 → 0 +1=1 mod4 → not divisible by 4.

n=3: same as n=1, since 3≡-1 mod4, so (-1)^4=1 mod4 → same as n=1.

n=4: 4⁴=256 mod4=0 → same as n=2.

So n⁴ ≡0 or 1 mod4. So n⁴ +1 is either 1 or 2 mod4. Thus, for p=2, there is no n such that n⁴ +1 is divisible by 4. So p=2 is out.

Next prime is p=3.

Check if n⁴ ≡ -1 mod9 has a solution.

Compute n⁴ mod9 for n=1,2,...,8.

Let me compute:

1⁴=1 mod9 → 1.

2⁴=16 mod9=7.

3⁴=81 mod9=0.

4⁴=(256) mod9: 256 ÷9=28*9=252, 256-252=4 → 4 mod9.

5⁴=625 mod9: 625 ÷9=69*9=621, 625-621=4 → 4.

Wait, same as 4⁴?

Wait, 5 mod9 is same as -4, so 5⁴=(-4)^4=256 mod9=4.

Similarly, 6⁴: 6 mod9=6, 6^2=36≡0 mod9, so 6⁴=0 mod9.

7⁴: 7 mod9=-2, so (-2)^4=16 mod9=7.

8⁴: 8 mod9=-1, (-1)^4=1 mod9.

So the possible n⁴ mod9 are 0,1,4,7.

Looking for -1 mod9, which is 8 mod9. So 8 is not in {0,1,4,7}. So no solution for p=3.

So p=3 is also out.

Next prime p=5.

Check if n⁴ ≡ -1 mod25 has a solution.

Compute n⁴ mod25 for various n.

Hmm, n can be from 1 to 24. Maybe there's a pattern.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use Euler's theorem. Since 25 is 5², φ(25)=20. So Euler's theorem says that n^20 ≡1 mod25 when n is coprime to 25.

So exponents cycle modulo φ(25)=20.

We need n⁴ ≡ -1 mod25.

Let's see, if such an n exists, then (n⁴)^5 ≡ (-1)^5 ≡ -1 mod25.

But n^20 ≡1 mod25. So n^20 ≡1, but also n^20 = (n^4)^5 ≡ (-1)^5 ≡-1 mod25. So that would imply 1 ≡-
