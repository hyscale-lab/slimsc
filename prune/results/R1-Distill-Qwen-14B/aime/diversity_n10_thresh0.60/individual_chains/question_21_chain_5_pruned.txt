Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the smallest integer base b (where b is at least 2) such that there are more than ten b-eautiful numbers. A number n is called b-eautiful if it has exactly two digits in base b, and the sum of these two digits equals the square root of n. For example, 81 is 13-eautiful because in base 13, it's written as 63, and 6 + 3 equals 9, which is the square root of 81. 

First, I need to understand what it means for a number to have exactly two digits in base b. In any base b, a two-digit number would be something like "ab" where a is the first digit (the "tens" place in base 10) and b is the second digit (the "units" place). But in base b, the actual value is a*b + b, right? Wait, no, the digits are in base b, so the value is a*b + c, where a is the coefficient of b^1 and c is the coefficient of b^0. So, the number n can be expressed as n = a*b + c, where a and c are digits in base b. That means a can range from 1 to b-1 (since it's the leading digit and can't be zero), and c can range from 0 to b-1.

The condition for being b-eautiful is that the sum of the two digits a + c equals the square root of n. So, we have the equation:

a + c = sqrt(n)

But since n is expressed as a*b + c, substituting that in, we get:

a + c = sqrt(a*b + c)

Hmm, okay. Let me square both sides to eliminate the square root:

(a + c)^2 = a*b + c

Expanding the left side:

a^2 + 2*a*c + c^2 = a*b + c

Let me rearrange this equation to bring all terms to one side:

a^2 + 2*a*c + c^2 - a*b - c = 0

Hmm, this seems a bit complicated. Maybe I can express it differently. Let me group terms:

a^2 + (2*c - b)*a + c^2 - c = 0

That's a quadratic equation in terms of a. Maybe I can solve for a in terms of c and b. Let me write it as:

a^2 + (2c - b) * a + (c^2 - c) = 0

To solve for a, I can use the quadratic formula. The quadratic is in the form:

a^2 + (2c - b) a + (c^2 - c) = 0

So, discriminant D would be:

D = (2c - b)^2 - 4 * 1 * (c^2 - c)

Let me compute that:

D = 4c^2 - 4b c + b^2 - 4c^2 + 4c

Simplify:

4c^2 - 4b c + b^2 - 4c^2 + 4c = (-4b c + 4c) + b^2

Factor out 4c:

= 4c(-b + 1) + b^2

So, D = 4c(1 - b) + b^2

Hmm, this discriminant must be a perfect square for a to be an integer because a is a digit and needs to be an integer. So, D = k^2 for some integer k.

Therefore, 4c(1 - b) + b^2 must be a perfect square.

This seems a bit tricky. Maybe I can approach this differently. Let me think about possible values of a and c.

Since a is a digit in base b, it must satisfy 1 ≤ a ≤ b-1. Similarly, c is a digit, so 0 ≤ c ≤ b-1.

Given that a and c are digits, their sum a + c must be an integer because sqrt(n) must be integer (since sqrt(n) = a + c). Therefore, n must be a perfect square. So, n = m^2, where m is a positive integer.

Given that, n = a*b + c = m^2, and m = a + c. So, we have:

m = a + c
n = m^2 = a*b + c

So, substituting m = a + c into the second equation:

m^2 = a*b + c

But since m = a + c, we can write c = m - a. So substituting that into the equation:

m^2 = a*b + (m - a)

Simplify:

m^2 = a*b + m - a

Bring all terms to one side:

m^2 - m = a*b - a

Factor a on the right-hand side:

m^2 - m = a*(b - 1)

So, m(m - 1) = a*(b - 1)

This seems interesting. So, a must be a divisor of m(m - 1). Also, since a is between 1 and b-1, and b is at least 2, a is at least 1.

Let me think: since a*(b - 1) = m(m - 1), and a is a positive integer less than b, perhaps I can express b in terms of a, m.

From the equation:

b - 1 = [m(m - 1)] / a

Therefore:

b = 1 + [m(m - 1)] / a

Since b must be an integer greater than or equal to 2, [m(m - 1)] must be divisible by a.

Given that a is a positive integer, and a must divide m(m - 1).

Also, since a and c are digits in base b, with a ≤ b-1 and c = m - a ≤ b -1.

So, c = m - a ≤ b - 1.

But since a ≤ b -1, and c = m - a, we can write:

m - a ≤ b -1

But from the previous equation, b = 1 + [m(m -1)]/a.

Substituting into the inequality:

m - a ≤ [1 + [m(m -1)]/a] - 1

Simplify the right-hand side:

[m(m -1)] / a

So:

m - a ≤ [m(m -1)] / a

Multiply both sides by a (since a is positive, inequality remains the same):

a*(m - a) ≤ m(m -1)

Expand left side:

a*m - a^2 ≤ m^2 - m

Bring all terms to left:

a*m - a^2 - m^2 + m ≤ 0

Factor:

- m^2 + (a +1)m - a^2 ≤ 0

Multiply both sides by -1 (inequality flips):

m^2 - (a +1)m + a^2 ≥ 0

This is a quadratic in m:

m^2 - (a + 1)m + a^2 ≥ 0

Let me compute the discriminant of this quadratic:

D = (a + 1)^2 - 4*1*a^2 = a^2 + 2a +1 -4a^2 = -3a^2 + 2a +1

For the quadratic to be non-negative for all m, the discriminant must be ≤0, but wait, that's not necessarily the case because m is a variable here. Maybe this approach is complicating things.

Alternatively, perhaps I can consider specific values for a and m.

Given that a must divide m(m -1), let me think about possible a and m values that satisfy m(m-1) divisible by a.

Also, since a and c are digits in base b, and c = m -a, we must have c ≥0 and c ≤ b-1.

But since b = 1 + [m(m-1)]/a, and c = m - a, which must satisfy c ≤ [m(m-1)]/a.

Let me try to find possible a and m.

Let me rearrange b:

b = 1 + [m(m-1)]/a

Thus, since b must be an integer, [m(m-1)] must be divisible by a.

So, for given a, m can be such that a divides m(m-1). Alternatively, for a given m, a must be a divisor of m(m-1).

So, perhaps I can iterate over possible m and find a's such that a divides m(m-1), compute b, and check if c = m -a is a valid digit in base b.

Wait, but I need to find for each base b, how many n's are b-eautiful.

The goal is to find the minimal b such that the number of b-eautiful numbers is more than ten.

So, perhaps I can approach this by, for each b, determine how many pairs (a, c) satisfy the conditions:

1. n = a*b + c is a perfect square, m^2, where m = a + c.

2. 1 ≤ a ≤ b-1, 0 ≤ c ≤ b-1.

So, for each base b, I need to find all pairs (a, c) such that a*b + c = (a + c)^2.

So, the equation is:

a*b + c = (a + c)^2

Which simplifies to:

a*b + c = a^2 + 2ac + c^2

Rearranged:

a^2 + 2ac + c^2 - a*b - c = 0

Which is a quadratic in a:

a^2 + (2c - b)a + (c^2 - c) = 0

As I had before.

So, for each b, I can iterate over possible c (from 0 to b-1) and solve for a.

But since a must be an integer, the discriminant must be a perfect square.

Wait, let me think again.

For each b, the number of solutions is determined by how many (a, c) pairs satisfy the equation.

Alternatively, maybe I can express the equation in terms of m.

From earlier, we have:

m = a + c

n = m^2 = a*b + c

So, c = m - a, substituting into n:

m^2 = a*b + m - a

Which gives:

m^2 - m = a*(b -1)

So, a = (m^2 - m)/(b -1)

Since a must be an integer between 1 and b-1, for each m, (m^2 - m) must be
