Okay, so I'm trying to solve this math problem where I need to find the greatest four-digit number N. The condition is that whenever any one of its digits is changed to 1, the resulting number is divisible by 7. Then, I have to find Q + R where Q is the quotient and R is the remainder when N is divided by 1000.

Hmm, let's start by understanding the problem. N is a four-digit number, so it ranges from 1000 to 9999. The key property is that if I change any single digit of N to 1, the new number must be divisible by 7. So, no matter which digit I replace (thousands, hundreds, tens, or units place), replacing it with 1 should give a multiple of 7.

Let me denote N as a four-digit number with digits A, B, C, D. So, N = 1000A + 100B + 10C + D. Each of A, B, C, D is between 0 and 9, and A is at least 1 because it's a four-digit number.

When we replace a digit with 1, we get four different numbers:

1. Replace A with 1: 1BCD = 1000 + 100B + 10C + D
2. Replace B with 1: A1CD = 1000A + 100 + 10C + D
3. Replace C with 1: AB1D = 1000A + 100B + 10 + D
4. Replace D with 1: ABC1 = 1000A + 100B + 10C + 1

Each of these four numbers must be divisible by 7. So, I can write four modular equations:

1. 1000 + 100B + 10C + D ≡ 0 mod 7
2. 1000A + 100 + 10C + D ≡ 0 mod 7
3. 1000A + 100B + 10 + D ≡ 0 mod 7
4. 1000A + 100B + 10C + 1 ≡ 0 mod 7

I need to find N = 1000A + 100B + 10C + D such that all four of these are true. Since N is the greatest such four-digit number, I should start checking from 9999 downwards until I find one that satisfies all four conditions.

But that might be time-consuming. Maybe I can find a smarter approach by analyzing the modular conditions.

First, let's compute the modular equivalents of the numbers. Let me compute 1000 mod 7, 100 mod 7, 10 mod 7, and 1 mod 7.

Calculating:

7 * 142 = 994, so 1000 - 994 = 6 → 1000 ≡ 6 mod 7
100 / 7 is 14*7=98, so 100 ≡ 2 mod 7
10 ≡ 3 mod 7
1 ≡ 1 mod 7

So, 1000 ≡ 6, 100 ≡ 2, 10 ≡ 3, 1 ≡ 1 mod 7.

Now, let's rewrite each condition:

1. 1BCD ≡ 0 mod 7 → 6 + 2B + 3C + D ≡ 0 mod 7
2. A1CD ≡ 0 mod 7 → 6A + 2 + 3C + D ≡ 0 mod 7
3. AB1D ≡ 0 mod 7 → 6A + 2B + 3 + D ≡ 0 mod 7
4. ABC1 ≡ 0 mod 7 → 6A + 2B + 3C + 1 ≡ 0 mod 7

So, four equations:

1. 6 + 2B + 3C + D ≡ 0 mod7 → Equation (1)
2. 6A + 2 + 3C + D ≡ 0 mod7 → Equation (2)
3. 6A + 2B + 3 + D ≡ 0 mod7 → Equation (3)
4. 6A + 2B + 3C + 1 ≡ 0 mod7 → Equation (4)

Now, I can set up these equations and try to find relationships between A, B, C, D.

Let me subtract Equation (1) from Equation (4):

Equation (4) - Equation (1):

(6A + 2B + 3C + 1) - (6 + 2B + 3C + D) ≡ 0 mod7
Simplify:
6A -6 + 0B +0C +1 - D ≡ 0 mod7
6(A -1) + (1 - D) ≡ 0 mod7
6(A -1) ≡ (D -1) mod7

So, 6(A -1) ≡ D -1 mod7 → Equation (5)

Similarly, let's subtract Equation (2) from Equation (4):

Equation (4) - Equation (2):
(6A + 2B + 3C +1) - (6A + 2 + 3C + D) ≡ 0 mod7
Simplify:
0A + 2B - 2 + 0C +1 - D ≡ 0 mod7
2(B -1) + (1 - D) ≡ 0 mod7 → Equation (6)
→ 2(B -1) ≡ (D -1) mod7

So, from Equation (5) and (6):

Equation (5): 6(A -1) ≡ (D -1) mod7
Equation (6): 2(B -1) ≡ (D -1) mod7

So, 6(A -1) ≡ 2(B -1) mod7

Divide both sides by 2 (since 2 and 7 are coprime, we can do this):

3(A -1) ≡ (B -1) mod7 → Equation (7)

So, B -1 ≡ 3(A -1) mod7 → Equation (7)

Similarly, let's subtract Equation (1) from Equation (3):

Equation (3) - Equation (1):

(6A + 2B +3 + D) - (6 + 2B + 3C + D) ≡0 mod7
Simplify:
6A -6 +0B -0C +3 -3C + D - D → Wait, that doesn't seem right. Let me do it step by step.

Wait, Equation (3): 6A + 2B +3 + D
Equation (1): 6 + 2B + 3C + D
Subtract (1) from (3):
(6A + 2B +3 + D) - (6 + 2B + 3C + D) = 6A -6 +0B +3 -3C +0D
So, 6A -6 +3 -3C ≡0 mod7
Simplify:
6A -3 -3C ≡0 mod7
Divide all terms by 3 (since 3 and 7 are coprime):
2A -1 -C ≡0 mod7 → Equation (8)
→ 2A - C ≡1 mod7 → Equation (8)

So, that's another equation: 2A - C ≡1 mod7.

Now, let's collect all equations:

Equation (5): 6(A -1) ≡ (D -1) mod7
Equation (6): 2(B -1) ≡ (D -1) mod7
Equation (7): 3(A -1) ≡ (B -1) mod7
Equation (8): 2A - C ≡1 mod7

Additionally, Equation (1): 6 + 2B + 3C + D ≡0 mod7

So, maybe we can express variables in terms of others.

From Equation (7): B = 3(A -1) +1 mod7.

But B is a digit (0-9), so B can be expressed as:

B = 3(A -1) +7k +1, for some integer k. Since B is 0-9, let's find possible values.

Similarly, from Equation (8): C = 2A -1 mod7. So C = (2A -1) mod7. Since C is a digit, it can be written as C = (2A -1) +7m, where m is such that C is 0-9.

From Equation (5): D = 6(A -1) +1 mod7. So D = 6(A-1) +1 +7n, for some integer n, and D is 0-9.

Similarly, from Equation (6): D = 2(B -1) +1 mod7. So D = 2(B -1) +1 +7p, for some integer p.

Since D must satisfy both, we can set these equal:

6(A -1) +1 +7n = 2(B -1) +1 +7p
Simplify:
6(A-1) = 2(B-1) +7(p -n)
Divide both sides by 2:
3(A-1) = (B -1) + (7/2)(p -n)

But since the left side is an integer, the right side must also be. Therefore, (p -n) must be even. Let me denote q = (p -n)/2, an integer.

So, 3(A -1) = (B -1) +7q.

But from Equation (7), we have B -1 =3(A -1) +7k.

Wait, wait, from Equation (7):

3(A -1) ≡ B -1 mod7 → B -1 =3(A -1) +7k, for some integer k.

Plugging into the above equation:

3(A-1) = [3(A -1) +7k] +7q

Simplify:

3(A -1) = 3(A -1) +7k +7q
Subtract 3(A -1) from both sides:
0 =7(k + q)
So, 7 divides 0, which implies k + q =0 → q = -k.

So, regardless, the relation holds, and D can be expressed in terms of A.

I think it's better to express D in terms of A.

From Equation (5): D ≡6(A -1) +1 mod7.

So, D =6(A -1) +1 +7n.

Since D is a digit (0-9), 6(A-1) +1 must be between 0 and 9 when we add 7n.

Let me compute 6(A-1)+1 for A from 1 to 9:

A=1: 6(0)+1=1 → D=1 +7n. Since D≤9
