Okay, so I've got this problem here where I need to find the greatest four-digit number N. The special thing about N is that if you change any one of its digits to 1, the new number becomes divisible by 7. Then, I need to find Q and R where Q is the quotient and R is the remainder when N is divided by 1000. Finally, add Q and R together to get the answer.

Let me break this down. First, N is a four-digit number, so it's between 1000 and 9999. I need the greatest such number, so I should probably start checking from 9999 downwards until I find N.

The key property here is that changing any single digit of N to 1 will make the number divisible by 7. So, for example, if N is ABCD, then changing A to 1 gives 1BCD, changing B to 1 gives A1CD, and so on for each digit. Each of these modified numbers must be divisible by 7.

Hmm, okay. So for each digit position, replacing it with 1 must result in a number divisible by 7. That sounds like a lot of conditions to satisfy, which might limit the possibilities for N.

Let me consider the four cases where each digit is replaced by 1:

1. Replacing the thousands digit (A) with 1: 1BCD is divisible by 7.
2. Replacing the hundreds digit (B) with 1: A1CD is divisible by 7.
3. Replacing the tens digit (C) with 1: AB1D is divisible by 7.
4. Replacing the units digit (D) with 1: ABC1 is divisible by 7.

So, N must be such that all these four modified numbers are divisible by 7.

Since I'm looking for the greatest N, I want the largest possible four-digit number, so I should check numbers starting from 9999 downwards. But that could take a long time if I do it manually. Maybe I can find some patterns or constraints to narrow it down.

Let me think about each digit.

First, let's denote N as a four-digit number with digits A, B, C, D. So N = 1000*A + 100*B + 10*C + D.

When we replace A with 1, the number becomes 1000 + 100*B + 10*C + D. Let's denote this as N1 = 1000 + 100B + 10C + D. This must be divisible by 7.

Similarly, replacing B with 1 gives N2 = 1000A + 100 + 10C + D. Must be divisible by 7.

Replacing C with 1 gives N3 = 1000A + 100B + 10 + D. Must be divisible by 7.

Replacing D with 1 gives N4 = 1000A + 100B + 10C + 1. Must be divisible by 7.

So, we have four conditions:

1. N1 = 1000 + 100B + 10C + D ≡ 0 mod 7
2. N2 = 1000A + 100 + 10C + D ≡ 0 mod 7
3. N3 = 1000A + 100B + 10 + D ≡ 0 mod 7
4. N4 = 1000A + 100B + 10C + 1 ≡ 0 mod 7

I can write these congruences and try to find relationships between the digits A, B, C, D.

Let me compute each modulo 7.

First, note that 1000 mod 7: 1000 divided by 7 is 142*7=994, remainder 6. So 1000 ≡ 6 mod7.

Similarly, 100 ≡ 2 mod7 because 100/7=14*7=98, remainder 2.

10 ≡ 3 mod7 because 10-7=3.

1 ≡1 mod7.

So:

1. N1 = 1000 + 100B + 10C + D ≡ 6 + 2B + 3C + D ≡0 mod7.

2. N2 = 1000A + 100 + 10C + D ≡6A + 2 + 3C + D ≡0 mod7.

3. N3 = 1000A + 100B + 10 + D ≡6A + 2B + 3 + D ≡0 mod7.

4. N4 = 1000A + 100B + 10C + 1 ≡6A + 2B + 3C +1 ≡0 mod7.

So now, I have four congruences:

1. 6 + 2B + 3C + D ≡0 mod7. (Equation 1)
2. 6A + 2 + 3C + D ≡0 mod7. (Equation 2)
3. 6A + 2B + 3 + D ≡0 mod7. (Equation 3)
4. 6A + 2B + 3C +1 ≡0 mod7. (Equation 4)

I need to solve these equations for A, B, C, D, each between 0 and 9 (with A≠0 since it's a four-digit number).

Let me see if I can find relationships between these equations.

Let's subtract Equation 1 and Equation 2 to eliminate some variables.

Equation 1: 6 + 2B + 3C + D ≡0
Equation 2: 6A + 2 + 3C + D ≡0

Subtract Equation 2 - Equation 1:

(6A + 2 + 3C + D) - (6 + 2B + 3C + D) ≡0-0 mod7
Simplify:

6A + 2 -6 -2B ≡0 mod7
6A -2B -4 ≡0 mod7
Let me write this as 6A -2B ≡4 mod7.

Divide both sides by 2: 3A - B ≡2 mod (7/ gcd(2,7)) → since 2 and7 are coprime, so mod7.

So, 3A - B ≡2 mod7. (Equation 5)

Similarly, let's subtract Equation 3 and Equation 2.

Equation 3:6A + 2B + 3 + D ≡0
Equation 2:6A + 2 + 3C + D ≡0

Subtract Equation 3 - Equation 2:

(6A + 2B + 3 + D) - (6A + 2 + 3C + D) ≡0-0 mod7
Simplify:

2B +3 -2 -3C ≡0 → 2B -3C +1 ≡0 mod7.
So, 2B -3C ≡-1 mod7 → 2B -3C ≡6 mod7. (Equation 6)

Now, consider Equation 4:6A + 2B + 3C +1 ≡0 mod7.

Let me try to find relations between these equations.

From Equation 4: 6A + 2B + 3C ≡-1 mod7. (Equation 4a)

From Equation 1: 6 + 2B + 3C + D ≡0 mod7 → D ≡ -6 -2B -3C mod7.

Similarly, from Equation 2:6A +2 +3C + D ≡0 → D ≡-6A -2 -3C mod7.

So, from Equations 1 and 2, we have:

-6 -2B -3C ≡ -6A -2 -3C mod7.

Simplify:

-6 -2B ≡ -6A -2 mod7.

Bring variables to left and constants to right:

-2B +6A ≡ -2 +6 mod7 → 6A -2B ≡4 mod7.

Which is consistent with Equation 5, so no new info.

Let me try another approach.

From Equation 5: 3A - B ≡2 mod7.

So, B ≡3A -2 mod7. Since B is a digit (0-9), B can be written as B = 7k + (3A -2), where k is such that B is in 0-9.

Similarly, Equation 6:2B -3C ≡6 mod7.

We can express B from Equation 5 as B=3A -2 +7k, so plug into Equation 6:

2*(3A -2 +7k) -3C ≡6 mod7

Simplify:

6A -4 +14k -3C ≡6 mod7

But 14k ≡0 mod7, so:

6A -4 -3C ≡6 mod7 →6A -3C -4 ≡6 mod7 →6A -3C ≡10 mod7 →6A -3C ≡3 mod7.

Divide both sides by 3: 2A - C ≡1 mod7. (Equation 7)

So, C ≡2A -1 mod7. Since C is a digit (0-9), C=7m + (2A -1), where m is such that C is in 0-9.

Now, from Equation 4a:6A +2B +3C ≡-1 mod7.

We can substitute B and C from Equations 5 and 7.

From Equation 5: B=3A -2 +7k.

From Equation 7: C=2A -1 +7m.

Substitute into Equation 4a:

6A + 2*(3A -2 +7k) +3*(2A -1 +7m) ≡-1 mod7.

Compute:

6A + 6A -4 +14k +6A -3 +21m ≡-1 mod7.

Combine like terms:

(6A +6A +6A) + (-4 -3) + (14k +21m) ≡-1 mod7.

18A -7 + (7*(2k + 3m)) ≡-1 mod7.

But 18A mod7: 18=2*7+4 →18≡4 mod7, so 18A≡4A mod7.

Similarly, -7 ≡0 mod7, and 7*(...) ≡0 mod7.

So, 4A ≡-1 mod7 →4A ≡6 mod7.

Multiply both sides by the inverse of 4 mod7. The inverse of 4 mod7 is 2 because 4*2=8≡1 mod7.

So, A ≡6*2=12≡5 mod7.

Therefore, A ≡5 mod7. Since A is a digit (1-9), the possible values of A are 5 and 12, but 12 is not a digit. So A=5.

Wait, wait. 5 mod7 is 5, 5+7=12 which is invalid for a digit. So A must be 5.

So, A=5.

Now, let's find B from Equation 5: B=3A -2 mod7.

A=5, so 3*5=15, 15-2=13. 13 mod7 is 6. So B≡6 mod7. So B can be 6 or 13, but 13 is invalid. So B=6.

Next, find C from Equation 7: C=2A -1 mod7.

A=5, so 2*5=10, 10-1=9. 9 mod7=2. So C≡2 mod7. So possible values for C are 2 and 9 (since C is a digit, 0-9).

So C can be 2 or 9.

Now, let's consider D.

From Equation 1: 6 + 2B + 3C + D ≡0 mod7.

We have B=6, so 2B=12. 3C is either 3*2=6 or 3*9=27.

Case 1: C=2.

Then, 6 + 12 + 6 + D ≡0 mod7 →24 + D ≡0 mod7.

24 mod7: 24-3*7=24-21=3. So 3 + D ≡0 → D≡-3≡4 mod7.

So D can be 4 or 11, but D is a digit, so D=4.

Case 2: C=9.

Then, 3C=27, 27 mod7 is 6 (27-3*7=6). So,

6 + 12 +6 + D ≡0 mod7 →24 + D ≡0 mod7 → same as before, D≡4 mod7.

So D=4 or 11, but D must be a single digit, so D=4.

So, regardless of C being 2 or 9, D=4.

Now, let's summarize:

A=5, B=6, C is either 2 or9, D=4.

So, possible Ns are 5 6 2 4 and 5 6 9 4.

But since we're looking for the greatest four-digit number, we need to choose the larger between 5624 and 5694.

5694 is larger, so let's check if N=5694 satisfies the condition that changing any digit to 1 results in a number divisible by 7.

Wait, but I can't just assume it's the answer. I need to verify.

Wait, let me confirm: C can be 2 or 9. So there are two possibilities for C. So N could be 5624 or 5694.

But since we want the greatest N, 5694 is bigger than 5624, so let's check N=5694.

Wait, but I have to make sure that when any digit is changed to 1, the number is divisible by 7.

So, let's check each case for N=5694.

Digits are A=5, B=6, C=9, D=4.

Case 1: Replace A with 1: 1694.

Check if 1694 is divisible by 7.

Divide 1694 by7: 7*242=1694. Yes, exactly 242. So divisible by7.

Case 2: Replace B with1: 5194.

Check 5194/7.

7*742=5194. 7*700=4900, 7*42=294. 4900+294=5194. Yes, divisible by7.

Case3: Replace C with1: 5614.

Check 5614/7.

7*802=5614. 7*800=5600, 7*2=14. 5600+14=5614. Divisible by7.

Case4: Replace D with1: 5691.

Check 5691/7.

7*813=5691. 7*800=5600, 7*13=91. 5600+91=5691. Divisible by7.

So, yes, N=5694 satisfies all conditions.

But just to be thorough, let me check N=5624 as well.

A=5, B=6, C=2, D=4.

Replace A with1: 1624.

1624/7: 7*232=1624. Yes, divisible.

Replace B with1: 5124.

5124/7: 7*732=5124. Yes, 7*700=4900, 7*32=224. 4900+224=5124.

Replace C with1: 5614. As before, 5614/7=802. Yes.

Replace D with1: 5621.

5621/7: 7*803=5621. 7*800=5600, 7*3=21. 5600+21=5621. Yes.

So both N=5624 and 5694 satisfy the conditions. But since 5694 is larger, it's the answer.

Wait, but I thought N was 5694, but earlier I thought C could be 2 or9, but with A=5, B=6, C=9, D=4 gives N=5694, which is bigger.

So, N=5694.

Wait, but let's think if there's a larger N. Because 5694 is the second possibility. But maybe we can have a larger N, like 5694, but perhaps even higher.

Wait, I think I need to check if there's a higher N. Because maybe, for a higher A, like A=5+7=12, which is invalid. So A must be 5, as we deduced earlier.

Wait, no, because A is a digit. So A=5 is the maximum possible value for A under mod
