Okay, so I need to solve this geometry problem about a convex equilateral hexagon. Let me try to understand the problem first.

The hexagon is named ABCDEF, and it's convex and equilateral. That means all its sides are equal in length, and all its interior angles are less than 180 degrees. Also, it's given that all pairs of opposite sides are parallel. So, AB is parallel to DE, BC is parallel to EF, and CD is parallel to FA.

The problem mentions a triangle formed by extending the sides AB, CD, and EF. The sides of this triangle are 200, 240, and 300. I need to find the side length of the hexagon.

Hmm, okay, let me visualize this. Since the hexagon is convex and equilateral with opposite sides parallel, it's probably similar to a regular hexagon but not necessarily regular because the angles could be different. But in a regular hexagon, all sides are equal and all opposite sides are parallel, so maybe this is a variation of that.

But wait, in a regular hexagon, all sides are equal, and all opposite sides are parallel, but the hexagon here is just equilateral, not necessarily regular. So, the angles might not all be 120 degrees. But because opposite sides are parallel, that imposes some structure.

Now, the triangle formed by extending AB, CD, and EF. Let me think about what that means. So, if I extend the sides AB, CD, and EF, they form a triangle. The lengths of the sides of this triangle are 200, 240, and 300. So, these are the lengths of the sides of the triangle, which I'll call triangle XYZ, where X, Y, Z are the intersection points of the extended sides.

So, AB, CD, and EF are sides of the hexagon. When extended, they meet at points forming a larger triangle. Each side of this larger triangle is 200, 240, and 300. Now, I need to relate this to the side length of the hexagon.

I remember that in such configurations, especially with hexagons having opposite sides parallel, there might be similar triangles involved. Maybe the triangle formed is similar to the hexagon's sides when extended, but scaled up.

Wait, perhaps using coordinate geometry might help. Let me consider placing the hex
