Okay, so I'm trying to solve this hyperbola problem. The question is about points A, B, C, D on the hyperbola x²/20 - y²/24 = 1 forming a rhombus ABCD with diagonals intersecting at the origin. I need to find the greatest real number less than BD² for all such rhombi. Hmm, okay, let's break this down.

First, I remember that a rhombus is a quadrilateral with all sides equal, and its diagonals bisect each other at right angles, right? Wait, no, actually, in a rhombus, the diagonals bisect each other and the angles, but they aren't necessarily perpendicular unless it's a square. Wait, no, correction: in a rhombus, the diagonals are not necessarily perpendicular, but in a square, which is a special case, they are. Wait, no, actually, in a rhombus, the diagonals are not equal but they do bisect each other at right angles. Wait, no, wait, no, actually, in a rhombus, the diagonals are not perpendicular, but in a square, which is a special case of a rhombus, they are. Wait, no, no, sorry, I'm getting confused.

Let me think. In a rhombus, the diagonals bisect each other and the angles, but they are not necessarily perpendicular. However, in a square, which is a rhombus, the diagonals are perpendicular. So, actually, in a rhombus, the diagonals are
