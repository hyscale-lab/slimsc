Okay, so I have this problem here about finding the least integer base b (where b is at least 2) such that there are more than ten b-eautiful integers. Let me try to break this down.

First, what does it mean for a number n to be b-eautiful? It says that when n is written in base b, it has exactly two digits, and the sum of these two digits equals the square root of n. So, n is a two-digit number in base b, and the sum of its digits is sqrt(n).

Let me formalize this. In base b, a two-digit number can be expressed as a * b + c, where a and c are the digits. Since it's a two-digit number, a can't be zero, and c can be from 0 to b-1. So, n = a*b + c, where 1 ≤ a ≤ b-1 and 0 ≤ c ≤ b-1.

The condition given is that a + c = sqrt(n). So, sqrt(n) must be an integer because a and c are integers. Therefore, n must be a perfect square. Let me write that down:

n = a*b + c = k^2, where k is an integer. Also, a + c = k.

So, substituting a + c = k into n gives n = (a + c)*b + c - a*(b - 1) ??? Wait, maybe I should approach this differently.

Wait, n = a*b + c, and a + c = k. So, substituting k into n's equation:

n = a*b + c = (k - c)*b + c = k*b - c*b + c = k*b - c*(b - 1)

But since n = k^2, we have:

k^2 = k*b - c*(b - 1)

Hmm, maybe rearrange this equation:

k^2 - k*b + c*(b - 1) = 0

This is a quadratic in terms of k, but I'm not sure if that's helpful yet. Alternatively, maybe express c in terms of a and k.

Since a + c = k, then c = k - a.

Substituting back into n = a*b + c gives:

k^2 = a*b + (k - a)

So, k^2 = a*b + k - a.

Let me rearrange this:

k^2 - k = a*(b - 1)

So, a = (k^2 - k)/(b - 1)

Since a must be an integer between 1 and b-1, inclusive, the fraction (k^2 - k) must be divisible by (b - 1), and the resulting a must satisfy 1 ≤ a ≤ b-1.

So, for each base b, we can find all k such that (k^2 - k) is divisible by (b - 1), and then a = (k^2 - k)/(b - 1) must be an integer between 1 and b-1.

Additionally, since n is a two-digit number in base b, n must satisfy b ≤ n < b^2.

But n = k^2, so:

b ≤ k^2 < b^2

Taking square roots,

sqrt(b) ≤ k < b

Because k is an integer, k can range from ceil(sqrt(b)) to floor(b - 1). Wait, because k must be less than b. So k is from ceiling(sqrt(b)) up to b - 1.

So, for each b, k must be an integer in [ceil(sqrt(b)), b - 1], and for each such k, we check if (k^2 - k) is divisible by (b - 1). If it is, then a is (k^2 -k)/(b -1), which must be between 1 and b-1.

Also, c = k - a. Since c must be a digit in base b, c must satisfy 0 ≤ c ≤ b -
