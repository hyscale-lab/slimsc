Alright, so I've got this math problem about a 2x3 grid where I have to place digits in each cell. The conditions are that the sum of the two numbers formed by reading left to right is 999, and the sum of the three numbers formed by reading top to bottom is 99. The example given is a grid where the top row is 0, 0, 8 and the bottom row is 9, 9, 1. Let me try to figure out how to approach this.

First, let me visualize the grid. It's a 2x3 grid, so there are two rows and three columns. Each cell will contain a single digit (0-9). 

The problem involves two main conditions:

1. The sum of the two numbers formed by reading each row left to right is 999.
2. The sum of the three numbers formed by reading each column top to bottom is 99.

Wait, no, actually, let me re-read that. The problem says the sum of the two numbers formed by reading left to right is 999. Oh, right, so each row is a number, and their sum is 999. Similarly, the sum of the three numbers formed by reading top to bottom is 99. So each column is a two-digit number (since each column has two cells), and their sum is 99.

Wait, no, each column has two cells, so each column would form a two-digit number. So for each column, the top digit is the tens place and the bottom digit is the ones place. So each column contributes a two-digit number, and the sum of these three two-digit numbers is 99.

Similarly, each row is a three-digit number. The top row is a three-digit number, and the bottom row is another three-digit number. Their sum is 999.

So the grid is structured as:

Top row: A B C (forming the number ABC)
Bottom row: D E F (forming the number DEF)
So ABC + DEF = 999.

Each column is:
- Column 1: A followed by D, forming the number AD
- Column 2: B followed by E, forming the number BE
- Column 3: C followed by F, forming the number CF

So AD + BE + CF = 99.

Our goal is to find the number of ways
