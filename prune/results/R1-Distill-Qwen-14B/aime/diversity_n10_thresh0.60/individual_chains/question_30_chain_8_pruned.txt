Okay, so I've got this math problem here: I need to find the remainder when the product from k=0 to 12 of (2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k}) is divided by 1000, where ω is a 13th root of unity and ω isn't equal to 1. Hmm, that sounds a bit intimidating at first, but maybe I can break it down.

First, let me recall what a 13th root of unity is. So, ω is a complex number such that ω^13 = 1. Also, since ω ≠ 1, it's one of the primitive roots. The 13th roots of unity are the solutions to the equation x^13 = 1, right? So, they're all evenly spaced around the unit circle in the complex plane.

Now, the product I have to compute is the product over k=0 to 12 of (2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k}). Hmm, that looks a bit complicated. Maybe I can simplify the expression inside the product first.

Let me write it as 2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k}. Hmm, can I factor this somehow or maybe express it in terms of some other expression? Let me see. Let me try to rearrange terms: ω^{2k} - 2ω^k + 2. Hmm, that looks like a quadratic in terms of ω^k. Let me set x = ω^k and see what I get.

So, the expression becomes x² - 2x + 2. Hmm, that quadratic. Maybe I can factor it or find its roots. Let me calculate the discriminant: b² - 4ac = (−2)² − 4*1*2 = 4 − 8 = -4. So, the roots are x = [2 ± sqrt(-4)] / 2 = [2 ± 2i]/2 = 1 ± i. So, the quadratic factors as (x - (1 + i))(x - (1 - i)).

Therefore, x² - 2x + 2 = (x - (1 + i))(x - (1 - i)). So, substituting back x = ω^k, we have:

2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k} = (ω^k - (1 + i))(ω^k - (1 - i)).

So, the product we need is the product from k=0 to 12 of (ω^k - (1 + i))(ω^k - (1 - i)). That is, the product can be written as the product of two separate products: the product of (ω^k - (1 + i)) times the product of (ω^k - (1 - i)).

So, if I let P = product_{k=0}^{12} (ω^k - (1 + i)) and Q = product_{k=0}^{12} (ω^k - (1 - i)), then the total product is P * Q.

Now, I remember that for cyclotomic polynomials, the product of (x - ω^k) for k=0 to n-1 is x^n - 1, but wait, in our case, we have products of (ω^k - a) where a is a constant. So, maybe I can relate this to evaluating a polynomial at a specific point.

Wait, let's think about that. If I consider the polynomial f(x) = x^13 - 1. The roots of this polynomial are exactly the 13th roots of unity, so ω^0, ω^1, ..., ω^{12}. So, f(x) can be factored as product_{k=0}^{12} (x - ω^k).

But in our case, the product is product_{k=0}^{12} (ω^k - a), where a is a constant. Hmm, so that would be the same as product_{k=0}^{12} (a - ω^k) multiplied by (-1)^{13} because (ω^k - a) = -(a - ω^k). Since 13 is odd, (-1)^13 = -1, so product_{k=0}^{12} (ω^k - a) = (-1)^{13} product_{k=0}^{12} (a - ω^k) = - product_{k=0}^{12} (a - ω^k).

But product_{k=0}^{12} (a - ω^k) is equal to f(a), which is a^13 - 1, because f(x) = product_{k=0}^{12} (x - ω^k). So, product_{k=0}^{12} (a - ω^k) = f(a) = a^13 - 1.

Therefore, product_{k=0}^{12} (ω^k - a) = - (a^13 - 1) = 1 - a^13.

Wait, that's handy! So, in our case, for P and Q, we can write:

P = product_{k=0}^{12} (ω^k - (1 + i)) = 1 - (1 + i)^13

Similarly,

Q = product_{k=0}^{12} (ω^k - (1 - i)) = 1 - (1 - i)^13

Thus, the total product is P * Q = [1 - (1 + i)^13] * [1 - (1 - i)^13]

Hmm, now I need to compute (1 + i)^13 and (1 - i)^13, then plug them into this expression.

Let me recall that 1 + i can be expressed in polar form. The modulus of 1 + i is sqrt(1² + 1²) = sqrt(2), and its argument is π/4 radians because it's on the line y = x in the first quadrant.

So, 1 + i = sqrt(2) * e^{iπ/4}. Therefore, (1 + i)^13 = (sqrt(2))^13 * e^{i * 13 * π/4}.

Similarly, 1 - i is sqrt(2) * e^{-iπ/4}, so (1 - i)^13 = (sqrt(2))^13 * e^{-i * 13 * π/4}.

Let me compute each part step by step.

First, (sqrt(2))^13. Let's compute that. sqrt(2) is 2^(1/2), so (2^(1/2))^13 = 2^(13/2) = 2^6 * 2^(1/2) = 64 * sqrt(2). So, 64√2.

Next, e^{i * 13 * π/4}. Let's simplify the angle. 13 * π/4 is equal to 3π + π/4, because 13 divided by 4 is 3 with remainder 1, so 3 * 2π is 6π, but wait, no, 13 * π/4 is 3π + π/4, because 3π is 12π/4, so 13π/4 is 12π/4 + π/4 = 3π + π/4.

But angles are periodic modulo 2π, so let's subtract multiples of 2π to find the equivalent angle between 0 and 2π.

3π is 3π, and 3π - 2π = π, so 13π/4 is equal to π + π/4 = 5π/4. Because 13π/4 - 2π = 13π/4 - 8π/4 = 5π/4.

Similarly, e^{-i * 13 * π/4} is the same as e^{-i *5π/4}.

So, e^{i *13π/4} = e^{i *5π/4} and e^{-i *13π/4} = e^{-i *5π/4}.

So, (1 + i)^13 = 64√2 * e^{i5π/4} = 64√2 [cos(5π/4) + i sin(5π/4)].

Similarly, (1 - i)^13 = 64√2 [cos(5π/4) - i sin(5π/4)].

Let me compute cos(5π/4) and sin(5π/4). Cos(5π/4) is -√2/2, and sin(5π/4) is -√2/2.

So, (1 + i)^13 = 64√2 * (-√2/2 - i√2/2) = 64√2 * [ (-√2/2)(1 + i) ].

Similarly, (1 - i)^13 = 64√2 * (-√2/2 + i√2/2) = 64√2 * [ (-√2/2)(1 - i) ].

Wait, perhaps it's better to compute each step without substituting.

Wait, 64√2 multiplied by cos(5π/4) is 64√2 * (-√2/2) = 64√2 * (-√2)/2. Let me compute that: 64 * (√2 * √2) * (-1)/2 = 64 *
