Okay, so I've got this problem about coloring the vertices of a regular octagon either red or blue. Each vertex is colored independently with equal probability, so that's a 50-50 chance for each color. The question is about finding the probability that the octagon can be rotated in such a way that all the blue vertices end up where the red ones were originally. They mention that the probability is m/n, where m and n are coprime, and we need to find m + n.

Hmm, okay. Let me try to break this down. First, I'm picturing a regular octagon, which has eight sides, so eight vertices. Each vertex is colored either red or blue, each with probability 1/2. The octagon can be rotated, so we're considering rotational symmetries here.

The key point is that after some rotation, all the blue vertices should end up where there were originally red vertices. So, if I rotate the octagon by some number of positions, say k steps, then each blue vertex moves k positions clockwise (or counterclockwise, depending on the rotation direction), and after that, all the positions that were blue are now red, and vice versa. Wait, no, not necessarily vice versa. The problem says that all blue vertices end up where red ones were. So, the blues are mapped to the red positions, but the reds could go somewhere else.

Wait, maybe it's better to think in terms of the coloring after rotation. So, suppose the original coloring is C, and after rotation by k positions, the coloring becomes C'. Then, for every vertex, if C' has a blue at position i, then in the original C, that position i had a red. So, that would mean that the set of blue vertices in C' is a subset of the red vertices in C. But since each vertex is colored independently, perhaps the probability is about the colorings where such a rotation exists.

Alternatively, perhaps it's more precise: the problem states that the octagon can be rotated so that all blue vertices end up at positions where there were originally red vertices. So, after rotation, every blue vertex is over a red vertex. So, perhaps the rotated coloring's blue set is a subset of the original red set.

Wait, no. Let me think again. Suppose the original octagon has some blue and red vertices. When we rotate it by k positions, each blue vertex moves to a new position. The problem states that after this rotation, all the blue
