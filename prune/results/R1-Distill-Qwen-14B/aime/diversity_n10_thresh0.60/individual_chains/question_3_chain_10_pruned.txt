Okay, so I have this probability problem here about Jen entering a lottery. Let me try to understand it step by step.

First, Jen picks 4 distinct numbers from the set S, which is {1,2,3,...,9,10}. Then, 4 numbers are randomly chosen from S. She wins a prize if at least two of her numbers match two of the randomly chosen numbers. She wins the grand prize if all four of her numbers match the four chosen. The question is about the probability that she won the grand prize given that she won a prize. They mention this probability is m/n, where m and n are coprime, and we need to find m + n.

Hmm, so this sounds like a conditional probability problem. I remember that conditional probability is the probability of an event given that another event has occurred. The formula is P(A|B) = P(A ∩ B) / P(B), where A is the event we're interested in, and B is the condition.

In this case, event A is Jen winning the grand prize, and event B is her winning a prize. So, we need to find P(A|B) = P(A and B) / P(B). But wait, if she wins the grand prize, she must have won a prize as well because winning the grand prize means she has all four numbers matching, which is a subset of having at least two numbers matching. So, P(A ∩ B) is just P(A), because A is a subset of B.

So, the problem simplifies to finding P(A) / P(B). 

Let me break down what A and B are.

Event A: Jen's 4 numbers are exactly the same as the 4 randomly chosen numbers. So, the number of favorable outcomes is 1 (since she picked exactly the winning set), and the total possible outcomes are the number of ways to choose 4 numbers from 10, which is C(10,4).

Event B: Jen has at least two numbers matching the randomly chosen four. So, the favorable outcomes here are the number of ways she can have exactly two, three, or four numbers matching.

So, to compute P(B), we'll need to calculate the number of ways she can have exactly 2, 3, or 4 matches. 

Let me formalize this.

First, the total number of possible combinations when choosing 4 numbers from 10 is C(10,4).

For event A: the number of favorable outcomes is C(10-4,0) = 1 (since she has to pick all 4 correct numbers). So, P(A) = 1 / C(10,4).

Wait, no. Wait, actually, in the problem, Jen is picking her own set of 4 numbers, and then the lottery also picks 4 numbers. So, the probability space is all possible sets of 4 numbers that the lottery could pick, given that Jen has a fixed set. So, in reality, since the lottery is choosing 4 numbers from 10, and Jen's set is fixed, the probability is based on how many of the lottery's numbers overlap with Jen's.

So, actually, another way to model this is: given that Jen has a specific set of 4 numbers, what is the probability that the lottery's 4 numbers include at least two of her numbers, with the grand prize being all four. So, in this case, it's hypergeometric distribution, perhaps?

Yes, hypergeometric probability applies here because we are sampling without replacement.

The hypergeometric distribution models the probability of k successes (in this case, matching numbers) in n draws (lottery picks), without replacement, from a finite population containing a specific number of successes (Jen's 4 numbers).

So, the parameters are:

- Population size, N = 10
- Number of success states in the population, K = 4 (Jen's numbers)
- Number of draws, n = 4 (lottery picks)
- Number of observed successes, k

So, the probability that the lottery has exactly k numbers matching Jen's is given by:

P(k) = C(K, k) * C(N - K, n - k) / C(N, n)

So, for k = 2, 3, 4, we can compute the probabilities for event B, and then sum them up.

Similarly, the probability of event A is when k=4.

So, let's compute P(B) first.

Compute P(k=2) + P(k=3) + P(k=4).

Let me compute each term.

First, compute C(4,2)*C(6,2) / C(10,4) for k=2.

C(4,2) is 6, C(6,2) is 15, so 6*15=90. C(10,4)=210. So, P(k=2)=90/210.

Similarly, P(k=3) is C(4,3)*C(6,1)/C(10,4). C(4,3)=4, C(6,1)=6, so 4*6=24. So, P(k=3)=24/210.

P(k=4) is C(4,4)*C(6,0)/C(10,4) = 1*1=1, so 1/210.

Adding these up: 90 + 24 +1 = 115. So, P(B)=115/210.

Wait, wait, 90+24=114, plus 1 is 115. So, 115/210
