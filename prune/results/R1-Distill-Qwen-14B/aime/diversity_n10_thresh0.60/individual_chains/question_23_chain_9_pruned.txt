Okay, so I have this problem where there's a hyperbola given by the equation \( \frac{x^2}{20} - \frac{y^2}{24} = 1 \). Points A, B, C, and D lie on this hyperbola and form a rhombus ABCD. The diagonals of this rhombus intersect at the origin. I need to find the greatest real number that is less than \( BD^2 \) for all such rhombi. Hmm, that sounds a bit complex, but let me break it down.

First, I remember that a rhombus has all sides equal, and its diagonals bisect each other at right angles. Wait, no, actually, the diagonals of a rhombus bisect each other at right angles, but they aren't necessarily equal unless it's a square. So in this case, since the diagonals intersect at the origin, the origin is the midpoint of both diagonals. That makes sense because the rhombus is symmetric about the origin.

So if ABCD is a rhombus, the midpoints of the diagonals AC and BD are the origin. That means if point A is (x, y), then point C must be (-x, -y). Similarly, points B and D must be such that their midpoint is also the origin, so if B is (p, q), then D is (-p, -q).

But since all four points lie on the hyperbola, they must satisfy the equation \( \frac{x^2}{20} - \frac{y^2}{24} = 1 \). So points A and C satisfy this equation, as do points B and D.

Now, since ABCD is a rhombus, the sides AB, BC, CD, and DA are all equal in length. So, the distance between A and B should be equal to the distance between B and C, and so on.

Alternatively, another way to think about rhombus properties is that the diagonals are perpendicular to each other. So the product of their slopes should be -1. Maybe that approach will be helpful.

Let me assign coordinates to the points. Let's let point A be (x, y), so point C is (-x, -y). Let point B be (p, q), so point D is (-p, -q). Now, since the diagonals are AC and BD, their slopes should be negative reciprocals if they are perpendicular.
