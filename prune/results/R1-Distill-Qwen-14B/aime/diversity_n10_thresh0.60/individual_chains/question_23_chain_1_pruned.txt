Okay, so I've got this problem about a hyperbola and a rhombus. Let me try to understand it step by step. 

The hyperbola is given by the equation x²/20 - y²/24 = 1. So, it's a standard hyperbola centered at the origin, opening horizontally. The rhombus ABCD has its vertices on this hyperbola, and the diagonals intersect at the origin. I need to find the greatest real number that is less than BD² for all such rhombi. So, essentially, the infimum of BD² across all possible such rhombi.

First, let me recall some properties of a rhombus. A rhombus is a quadrilateral with all sides equal, and the diagonals bisect each other at right angles. Wait, no, actually, in a rhombus, the diagonals bisect each other and the angles, but they are not necessarily perpendicular unless it's a square. Hmm, no, wait, correction: in a rhombus, the diagonals are not necessarily perpendicular, but they do bisect each other at right angles. Wait, no, actually, in a rhombus, the diagonals are perpendicular. Yes, I think that's correct. So, the diagonals of a rhombus are perpendicular bisectors of each other.

Given that the diagonals intersect at the origin, which is the center of the hyperbola, that makes sense because the hyperbola is symmetric about the origin.

So, let's denote the diagonals as AC and BD. Since they intersect at the origin, which is their midpoint, the coordinates of A and C will be negatives of each other, and same for B and D. So, if A is (a, b), then C is (-a, -b). Similarly, if B is (c, d), then D is (-c, -d).

Since ABCD is a rhombus, all four sides must be equal in length. So, the distance between A and B should be equal to the distance between B and C, and so on.

But perhaps another approach would be to parameterize points on the hyperbola. Since all four points lie on the hyperbola, their coordinates satisfy x²/20 - y²/24 = 1.

Let me think about the coordinates of the points. Since the diagonals intersect at the origin, and the diagonals are AC and BD. So, points A and C are opposite vertices, as are B and D.

In a rhombus, the diagonals are perpendicular. So, the vectors AC and BD should be perpendicular. Let me represent vectors AC and BD.

Vector AC goes from A(a, b) to C(-a, -b), so the vector is (-2a, -2b). Similarly, vector BD goes from B(c, d) to D(-c, -d), so the vector is (-2c, -2d). Wait, but actually, the vectors AC and BD are from the origin to A and C, etc., but the diagonals themselves are the lines connecting A to C and B to D. So, the vectors representing the diagonals are (A - C) and (B - D). But since C is (-a, -b), A - C would be (a - (-a), b - (-b)) = (2a, 2
