Okay, so I have this problem about counting the number of paths on an 8x8 grid. The paths are from the lower left corner to the upper right corner, have a length of 16, and must change direction exactly four times. Hmm, okay, let's unpack this.

First, I know that on an 8x8 grid, moving from the lower left to the upper right requires moving 8 steps right and 8 steps up, right? So the total number of steps is 16. Without any restrictions, the number of such paths is the combination of 16 steps taken 8 at a time for one direction, which is C(16,8). But here, we have a restriction: the path must change direction exactly four times.

Wait, what does it mean to change direction exactly four times? Well, in a grid path, you can only move either right or up. Each time you switch from moving right to up or from up to right, that's a direction change. So, starting from the lower left, the first step is either right or up. If you have four direction changes, that means you switch directions four times. Let me think about how that translates into the number of segments in each direction.

Let's consider the number of straight segments. Each direction change adds a new segment. So, if you have four direction changes, how many segments are there? Well, if you start moving right, then change direction once to up, then again to right, etc., each direction change adds a segment. So, starting with one segment, each change adds another. So, four direction changes would result in five segments. Wait, is that right? Let me see.

For example, if I have one direction change, say right then up, that's two segments. So, direction changes = number of segments minus one. So, in general, if D is the number of direction changes, then the number of segments is D + 1.

But wait, in our case, the path can start with either right or up. So, if the path changes direction four times, it has five segments. Each segment is either entirely right or entirely up.

So, the path is made up of five segments, each of which is a consecutive sequence of right or up moves. Since we have to go from (0,0) to (8,8), the total number of right steps is 8, and the total number of up steps is 8.

So, in these five segments, each segment is either all right or all up. So, the number of right segments plus the number of up segments is equal to five. Let me denote:

Let the number of right segments be R, and the number of up segments be U. Then, R + U = 5.

Each right segment has at least one right step, and each up segment has at least one up step. So, the total right steps are 8, which is the sum of the lengths of all right segments. Similarly, total up steps are 8, the sum of all up segments.

Wait, but each right segment is at least 1, so if we have R right segments, the minimum total right steps would be R. Similarly for U. But in our case, the total right steps are 8, so R can't be more than 8. Same for U.

But since R + U = 5, both R and
