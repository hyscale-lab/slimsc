Okay, so I have this math problem here about Aya's morning walks. Let me try to understand it step by step. 

The problem says that Aya goes for a 9-kilometer-long walk every morning and then stops at a coffee shop. She walks at a constant speed, s kilometers per hour, and this walk takes her 4 hours, including t minutes she spends in the coffee shop. Then, when she increases her speed by 2 km/h, making it s+2 km/h, her walking time becomes 2 hours and 24 minutes, still including t minutes in the coffee shop. Now, we need to find out how long her walk takes her when she walks at s + 1/2 km/h, including the t minutes in the coffee shop.

Hmm, okay. So, the key here is that the total time includes both the walking time and the coffee shop time. So, for each scenario, we have total time = walking time + t.

Let me think about the first scenario. She walks 9 km at s km/h, so the walking time would be 9 / s hours. Then, she spends t minutes in the coffee shop. The total time for this is 4 hours. But wait, the t is in minutes, so I should probably convert everything to the same units.

Similarly, in the second scenario, she walks the same 9 km, but at s+2 km/h, so the walking time is 9 / (s+2) hours. The total time here is 2 hours and 24 minutes. Again, I need to convert that into hours or minutes consistently.

Let me convert t into hours because the walking times are in hours. So, t minutes is t/60 hours.

So for the first scenario:
Walking time = 9 / s hours
Coffee time = t / 60 hours
Total time = 4 hours
So, 9/s + t/60 = 4

Similarly, for the second scenario:
Walking time = 9 / (s + 2) hours
Coffee time = t / 60 hours
Total time = 2 hours and 24 minutes. Let me convert 24 minutes to hours: 24/60 = 0.4 hours, so total time is 2.4 hours.
So, 9/(s+2) + t/60 = 2.4

Now, I have two equations:
1) 9/s + t/60 = 4
2) 9/(s+2) + t/60 = 2.4

I can subtract the second equation from the first to eliminate t. Let me write that down.

Equation1 - Equation2:
[9/s + t/60] - [9/(s+2) + t/60] = 4 - 2.4
Simplify:
9/s - 9/(s+2) = 1.6

Now, let me compute 9/s - 9/(s+2) = 1.6.

Factor out the 9:
9 [1/s - 1/(s+2)] = 1.6

Compute the difference inside the brackets:
1/s - 1/(s+2) = [ (s+2) - s ] / [s(s+2)] = 2 / [s(s+2)]

So, 9 * [2 / (s(s+2))] = 1.6

Simplify:
18 / [s(s+2)] = 1.6

Multiply both sides by s(s+2):
18 = 1.6 * s(s+2)

Let me write that as:
1.6 s(s + 2) = 18

To make it easier, I can divide both sides by 1.6 to solve for s(s+2):

s(s + 2) = 18 / 1.6

Calculate 18 divided by 1.6: Let's see, 1.6 times 11 is 17.6, which is close to 18. So 18 / 1.6 = 11.25. Because 1.6 * 11.25 = 18. Let me check: 11 * 1.6 = 17.6, 0.25 *1.6=0.4, so 17.6 + 0.4=18. Yep, correct.

So, s(s + 2) = 11.25

That's a quadratic equation: s^2 + 2s - 11.25 = 0

Let me solve for s using the quadratic formula. The quadratic is s^2 + 2s - 11.25 = 0. So, a=1, b=2, c=-11.25.

Discriminant D = b^2 - 4ac = (2)^2 - 4(1)(-11.25) = 4 + 45 = 49

Square root of D is 7.

So, s = [-b ± sqrt(D)] / (2a) = [-2 ±7]/2

We have two solutions:
s = (-2 +7)/2 = 5/2 = 2.5
s = (-2 -7)/2 = -9/2 = -4.5

Since speed can't be negative, s must be 2.5 km/h.

Okay, so s is 2.5 km/h. Now, let's find t.

Using equation 1: 9/s + t/60 =4

Substitute s=2.5:

9 / 2.5 = 3.6 hours.

So, 3.6 + t/60 =4

Therefore, t/60 = 0.4 => t = 0.4 *60 =24 minutes.

So, t is 24 minutes.

Now, the question asks for the time when she walks at s + 1/2 km/h. Since s is 2.5, s + 0.5 = 3 km/h.

So, walking speed is 3 km/h, distance is 9 km, so walking time is 9 /3 =3 hours.

Plus the coffee time t=24 minutes. So total time is 3 hours + 24 minutes.

Convert 3 hours to minutes: 180 minutes. Plus 24 is 204 minutes.

But let me compute it in hours to see if needed as a decimal. 24 minutes is 0.4 hours, so 3.4 hours. But the question says to present the answer in minutes including t. So, 3 hours is 180 minutes, plus 24 minutes is 204 minutes.

So, the answer is 204 minutes.


To solve the problem, we start by setting up equations based on the given information. Let \( s \) be Aya's walking speed in km/h and \( t \) be the time she spends in the coffee shop in minutes.

### Step 1: Formulate the Equations
1. **First Scenario:**
   - Walking speed: \( s \) km/h
   - Walking time: \( \frac{9}{s} \) hours
   - Total time: 4 hours (including \( t \) minutes in the coffee shop)
   - Convert \( t \) minutes to hours: \( \frac{t}{60} \)
   - Equation: 
     \[
     \frac{9}{s} + \frac{t}{60} = 4
     \]

2. **Second Scenario:**
   - Walking speed: \( s + 2 \) km/h
   - Walking time: \( \frac{9}{s + 2} \) hours
   - Total time: 2 hours and 24 minutes, which is 2.4 hours (including \( t \) minutes in the coffee shop)
   - Equation:
     \[
     \frac{9}{s + 2} + \frac{t}{60} = 2.4
     \]

### Step 2: Subtract the Equations to Eliminate \( t \)
Subtract the second equation from the first:
\[
\left( \frac{9}{s} + \frac{t}{60} \right) - \left( \frac{9}{s + 2} + \frac{t}{60} \right) = 4 - 2.4
\]
Simplify:
\[
\frac{9}{s} - \frac{9}{s + 2} = 1.6
\]
Factor out 9:
\[
9 \left( \frac{1}{s} - \frac{1}{s + 2} \right) = 1.6
\]
Simplify the difference:
\[
9 \left( \frac{2}{s(s + 2)} \right) = 1.6
\]
\[
\frac{18}{s(s + 2)} = 1.6
\]
Multiply both sides by \( s(s + 2) \):
\[
18 = 1.6 s(s + 2)
\]
Divide by 1.6:
\[
s(s + 2) = 11.25
\]

### Step 3: Solve the Quadratic Equation
The equation \( s^2 + 2s - 11.25 = 0 \) is solved using the quadratic formula:
\[
s = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}
\]
Here, \( a = 1 \), \( b = 2 \), and \( c = -11.25 \):
\[
s = \frac{-2 \pm \sqrt{4 + 45}}{2} = \frac{-2 \pm 7}{2}
\]
This gives two solutions:
\[
s = 2.5 \quad \text{and} \quad s = -4.5
\]
Since speed cannot be negative, \( s = 2.5 \) km/h.

### Step 4: Find \( t \)
Using the first equation:
\[
\frac{9}{2.5} + \frac{t}{60} = 4
\]
\[
3.6 + \frac{t}{60} = 4
\]
\[
\frac{t}{60} = 0.4 \implies t = 24 \text{ minutes}
\]

### Step 5: Calculate Time at \( s + \frac{1}{2} \) km/h
New speed: \( 2.5 + 0.5 = 3 \) km/h
Walking time: \( \frac{9}{3} = 3 \) hours = 180 minutes
Total time including coffee shop: \( 180 + 24 = 204 \) minutes

**Answer:** \boxed{204}
