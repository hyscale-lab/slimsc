Okay, so I'm trying to solve this probability problem about a regular octagon where each vertex is colored either red or blue with equal chance. The question is about finding the probability that the octagon can be rotated such that all the blue vertices end up where there were originally red vertices. The answer needs to be expressed as a fraction m/n, where m and n are coprime, and then find m + n.

Hmm, let me try to understand the problem. We have a regular octagon, so it has 8 vertices, each colored either red or blue, each with a 50% chance. Then, we need to find the probability that there's some rotation of the octagon such that every blue vertex moves to a position that was previously occupied by a red vertex.

Wait, so does that mean that after rotation, every blue vertex aligns with a red vertex? So, for example, if I rotate the octagon by some number of steps, all the blue ones are now where reds were, and all the reds are where blues were? Or maybe not necessarily all the reds, but just that each blue is now on a red spot.

Wait, let me think again. The problem says, "the octagon can then be rotated so that all of the blue vertices end up at positions where there were originally red vertices." So, after rotation, each blue vertex must be on a spot that was originally red. So, perhaps the set of blue vertices after rotation must be a subset of the original red vertices? Or maybe they must exactly coincide with the original red vertices? Hmm, not necessarily exactly, because if you rotate, the blue vertices just have to align with the original red positions. So, perhaps the rotation needs to map the set of blue vertices to a subset of the original red vertices. But since the octagon is regular, the number of blue and red vertices could vary.

Wait, but the octagon has 8 vertices, each colored red or blue. So, the number of blue vertices could be anywhere from 0 to 8. But the problem is about the existence of a rotation such that all blue vertices are mapped to the positions where there were originally red vertices. So, if you consider the octagon's rotational symmetries, which are rotations by 0°, 45°, 90°, ..., 315°, which correspond to rotations by 0, 1, 2, ..., 7 steps (since each step is 45°).

So,
