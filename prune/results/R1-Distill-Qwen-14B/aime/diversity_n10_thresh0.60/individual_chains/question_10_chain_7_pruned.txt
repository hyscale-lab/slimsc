Okay, so I've got this problem here about Alice and Bob choosing sets. Let me try to understand it step by step. 

First, Alice picks a set A of positive integers. Then Bob makes a list of all finite nonempty sets B where the maximum element of B is in A. It's given that Bob's list has 2024 sets. I need to find the sum of the elements in A.

Hmm, let me break this down. So, Bob is listing all finite nonempty sets B such that max(B) is in A. So, for each element a in A, Bob can include sets where a is the maximum. Each such set B will have a as its maximum, and the other elements are less than a.

Wait, so for each a in A, the number of possible sets B where a is the max is equal to how many? Well, for a particular a, the other elements of B must be selected from the positive integers less than a. But wait, the elements of B are positive integers, but the set B can be any finite nonempty set. So, for each a, the number of possible B's where max(B) = a is equal to the number of subsets of {1, 2, ..., a-1}, excluding the empty set, because B has to be nonempty. So, the number of such subsets is 2^{a-1} - 1.

Wait, let me think again. For each a, the elements of B must be a subset of {1, 2, ..., a} with a being the maximum. So, we can have any subset of {1
