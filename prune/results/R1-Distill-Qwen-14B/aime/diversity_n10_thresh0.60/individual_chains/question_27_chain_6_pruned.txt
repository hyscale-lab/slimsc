Okay, so I have this problem about a torus and a sphere. Let me try to visualize it. A torus is like a donut shape, right? It's created by rotating a circle around an axis in its plane, but the axis isn't passing through the circle. Instead, it's a distance away, so when you spin the circle around this axis, you get the donut shape.

The problem says the torus T is formed by revolving a circle with radius 3 around an axis that's in the plane of the circle and 6 units away from the center. So, I think the distance from the center of the generating circle to the axis of revolution is 6. That makes sense because when you revolve the circle around that axis, the resulting torus will have a major radius (the distance from the center of the tube to the center of the torus) of 6, and a minor radius (the radius of the tube itself) of 3.

Now, there's a sphere S with radius 11. The problem talks about two scenarios: when the torus rests on the inside of S and when it rests on the outside. In each case, they are tangent along a circle, and we need to find the radii of these circles, r_i and r_o, respectively. Then, we have to find the difference r_i - r_o and express it as a reduced fraction m/n, finally summing m and n.

Alright, let's break this down. First, let's consider the torus and the sphere. When the torus is inside the sphere and tangent, the point of tangency is a circle. Similarly, when it's outside, the tangency is another circle. Since the torus is symmetric, these circles of tangency will lie along certain planes relative to the torus and sphere.

I think I need to find the distance between the centers of the sphere and the torus in each case. Because when the torus is inside the sphere, the distance between their centers will be less than 11, and when it's outside, it'll be more than 11.

Wait, but the torus is a surface, so its "center" isn't a single point. Hmm, maybe I should think about the centers of the generating circles or something else.

Let me recall: the torus can be described using two radii: R (the major radius, the distance from the center of the tube to the center of the torus) and r (the minor radius, the radius of the tube). So in this case, R = 6 and r = 3.

When the torus is inside the sphere, the sphere has radius 11. The torus will be tangent to the sphere when the distance from the center of the sphere to the center of the torus plus the major radius R of the torus equals the radius of the sphere. Wait, but actually, when the torus is inside, the sphere is larger, so maybe the distance between centers is such that the sphere's radius is equal to the torus's center plus the torus's major radius.

Wait, maybe not. Let's think geometrically. The torus is a surface, so each point on it is at a certain distance from
