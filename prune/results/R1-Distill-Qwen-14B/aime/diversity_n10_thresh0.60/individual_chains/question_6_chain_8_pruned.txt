Okay, so I've got this problem where I need to find the number of intersections between two graphs. The graphs are defined by the equations y = 4g(f(sin(2πx))) and x = 4g(f(cos(3πy))). Hmm, that looks a bit complicated, but I can break it down step by step.

First, I need to understand what functions f and g are. The problem defines f(x) as ||x| - 1/2| and g(x) as ||x| - 1/4|. So both f and g are functions that take the absolute value of x, subtract a constant, and then take the absolute value again. This means they're both V-shaped graphs, right? Let me sketch these out mentally.

For f(x) = ||x| - 1/2|:
- The inner absolute function |x| creates a V-shape with the vertex at (0,0).
- Subtracting 1/2 gives |x| - 1/2, which shifts the graph down by 1/2. So the vertex moves to (0, -1/2). But since we take the absolute value again, any negative parts will be flipped above the x-axis.
- So the graph of f(x) will have vertices at x = ±1/2, where |x| - 1/2 = 0. The graph will be V-shaped with the bottom at y=0, opening upwards. So it's a W shape actually because of the double absolute. Wait, no, let me think again. Wait, f(x) is ||x| - 1/2|. So the function |x| is symmetric about the y-axis, subtract 1/2, then take the absolute again. So the points where |x| - 1/2 = 0 are at x=1/2 and x=-1/2. So f(x) will have a V-shape with the vertex at (0, 1/2), but wait no—actually, when you subtract 1/2 and then take absolute, it's like shifting the original V down by 1/2 and then reflecting any part below zero back up. So the graph will have a "W" shape, with minima at (±1/2, 0) and a maximum at (0, 1/2). Wait, no, that doesn't sound right.

Wait, let me compute f(x) at various points. Let's say x=0: f(0)=|0 - 1/2|=1/2. At x=1/2: f(1/2)=|1/2 -1/2|=0. At x=1: f(1)=|1 -1/2|=1/2. So the graph of f(x) is a V-shape with the vertex at (1/2, 0) on the right side, but since it's symmetric about y-axis, it also has a vertex at (-1/2, 0). So f(x) is a W-shaped graph with peaks at x=0, y=1/2, and valleys at x=±1/2
