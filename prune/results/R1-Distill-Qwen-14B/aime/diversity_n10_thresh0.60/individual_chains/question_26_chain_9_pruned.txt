Alright, so I have this geometry problem here. Let me first try to understand it step by step.

We have triangle ABC inscribed in a circle ω. The tangents to ω at points B and C intersect at point D. Then, the line AD intersects ω again at point P. We're given the lengths AB = 5, BC = 9, and AC = 10. We need to find AP, express it as a reduced fraction m/n, and then find m + n.

Hmm, okay. So, I need to find the length AP. Let me try to visualize the problem. Triangle ABC with sides AB=5, BC=9, AC=10. The circle ω is the circumcircle of ABC. From D, which is the intersection of the two tangents at B and C, we draw a line to A, and this line meets the circle again at P.

I remember that when two tangents are drawn from a point outside a circle to the circle, the lengths of these tangents are equal. So, DB = DC. That might be useful.

Since D is the intersection of the tangents at B and C, it lies on the external homothety axis of the circle, but maybe that's not directly helpful here.

Let me think about properties involving point D. Since DB and DC are tangents, triangle DBC is an isosceles triangle with DB = DC. Also, the line AD passes through the circle again at P, so AP is a secant.

I recall that when a secant and a tangent are drawn from the same point outside the circle, there's a relation called the power of a point. Specifically, the power of point D with respect to ω is equal to DB² (since DB is the tangent) and also equal to DP * DA. So, maybe I can use the power of point D here.

Power of a point D: DB² = DP * DA.

So, if I can find DB, I can relate it to DA and DP. Then, since AP = DA - DP, perhaps I can find AP.

But wait, I don't know DA yet. Alternatively, maybe I can write DA in terms of AP. Let me see. Since AP is the segment from A to P, and AD goes beyond P to D, so AD = AP + PD. So, if I let AP = x, then AD = x + PD.

Wait, but from the power of point D, DB² = DP * DA. So, substituting DA, we get DB² = DP * (x + DP). Hmm, but that introduces two variables, x and DP. Maybe I need another equation.

Alternatively, maybe I can express DA in terms of AP. Wait, actually, when you have a chord intersected by a secant, the power of point A with respect to ω is zero because A is on the circle. That might not be helpful.

Wait, perhaps I should consider triangle ABC and find some of its properties first. Maybe I can compute the circumradius of triangle ABC, which might help me later.

Given the sides AB = 5, BC = 9, AC = 10. Let me check if triangle ABC is valid. The sum of AB and BC is 5 + 9 = 14, which is greater than AC = 10. Similarly, other combinations are valid, so it's a valid triangle.

Let me compute the semi-perimeter (s) first. s = (5 + 9 + 10)/2 = 24/2 = 12.

Then, using Heron's formula, the area (Δ) of triangle ABC is sqrt[s(s - AB)(s - BC)(s - AC)] = sqrt[12(12 - 5)(12 - 9)(12 - 10)] = sqrt[12 * 7 * 3 * 2] = sqrt[504].

Wait, 504 factors into 16 * 31.5, but that might not be helpful. Alternatively, 504 = 16 * 31.5? Wait, no, 504 divided by 16 is 31.5, but maybe that's not the right approach. Let me compute it as sqrt[504] = sqrt[16 * 31.5], but that's not a perfect square. Wait, maybe 504 = 16 * 31.5 is incorrect. Let me compute 504 as 7 * 72, which is 7 * 9 * 8, so sqrt[7 * 9 * 8] = 3 * 2 * sqrt(14) = 6*sqrt(14). Wait, because 8 is 2^3, so sqrt(8) = 2*sqrt(2), but maybe I made a mistake.

Wait, 12*7 is 84, 84*3 is 252, 252*2 is 504. So Heron's formula gives area as sqrt(504) = sqrt(16 * 31.5) no, that's not helpful. Alternatively, 504 = 16 * 31.5 is not correct. Wait, 504 divided by 16 is 31.5, but 504 ÷ 16 is actually 31.5, but that's not helpful because 31.5 isn't a perfect square. Hmm, maybe I should just leave it as sqrt(504) for now.

Alternatively, perhaps I can compute the circumradius (R) using the formula R = (a*b*c)/(4Δ), where a, b, c are the sides, and Δ is the area.

So, a = 5, b = 9, c = 10. So, a*b*c = 5*9*10 = 450.

We have Δ = sqrt(504) as we found earlier. So, R = 450/(4*sqrt(504)).

Let me compute this.

First, sqrt(504) = sqrt(16 * 31.5) no, but 504 = 16 * 31.5 is wrong. Wait, 504 = 16 * 31.5? Let me see: 16 * 31.5 is 16*(30 + 1.5) = 480 + 24 = 504. So, sqrt(504) = sqrt(16 * 31.5) = 4*sqrt(31.5). Hmm, but 31.5 is 63/2, so sqrt(31.5) = sqrt(63/2) = (3*sqrt(14))/2. So sqrt(504) = 4*(3*sqrt(14)/2) = (12*sqrt(14))/2 = 6*sqrt(14). Oh, that's better.

So, Δ = 6*sqrt(14).

Thus, R = (450)/(4*6*sqrt(14)) = 450/(24*sqrt(14)).

Simplify numerator and denominator: 450 and 24 can both be divided by
