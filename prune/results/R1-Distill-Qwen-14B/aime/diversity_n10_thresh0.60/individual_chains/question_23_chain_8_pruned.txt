Okay, so I have this problem about a hyperbola and a rhombus. Let me try to understand what's given and what's being asked.

The hyperbola is given by the equation x²/20 - y²/24 = 1. So, it's a standard hyperbola centered at the origin, opening left and right. The transverse axis is along the x-axis because the positive term is with x². The a² is 20, so a is sqrt(20) which is 2*sqrt(5), and b² is 24, so b is 2*sqrt(6). The foci are at (±c, 0) where c² = a² + b² = 20 + 24 = 44, so c is sqrt(44) or 2*sqrt(11). But maybe I don't need the foci right now.

Now, the points A, B, C, D lie on this hyperbola, and ABCD is a rhombus. The diagonals intersect at the origin. So, the rhombus is centered at the origin, and its diagonals cross each other at the origin. That makes sense. Since it's a rhombus, all sides are equal, and the diagonals bisect each other at right angles? Wait, no, in a rhombus, the diagonals bisect each other and bisect the angles, but they are not necessarily perpendicular unless it's a square. Wait, no, actually in a rhombus, the diagonals are not perpendicular unless it's a square. Wait, no, I think in a rhombus, the diagonals are not necessarily perpendicular. Wait, no, wait, in a rhombus, the diagonals are not equal but they do bisect the angles, and they intersect at right angles. Oh, right, I think in a rhombus, the diagonals are perpendicular. So, they intersect at right angles. So, the rhombus is a quadrilateral with all sides equal, diagonals bisect each other at right angles, and in this case, the intersection point is the origin.

So, points A, B, C, D are on the hyperbola, arranged as a rhombus with diagonals intersecting at the origin.

I need to find the greatest real number less than BD² for all such rhombi. So, BD is one of the diagonals, and I need to find the supremum (the least upper bound) of BD², but the problem says the greatest real number less than BD² for all such rhombi. So, perhaps BD² is bounded above, and we need to find the maximum possible BD², but since it's a hyperbola, maybe as the rhombus becomes larger, BD² can get larger without bound? Or is there a constraint?

Wait, but points A, B, C, D are on the hyperbola, which is fixed. So, their positions are limited by the hyperbola equation.

Let me think about the properties of the rhombus.

In a rhombus, the diagonals are perpendicular bisectors of each other. So, if the diagonals intersect at the origin, then the points A, B, C, D are positioned such that A and C are endpoints of one diagonal, and B and D
