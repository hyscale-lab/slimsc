Okay, so I've got this probability problem here about Jen entering a lottery. Let me try to understand it step by step. 

First, the setup: Jen picks 4 distinct numbers from the set S, which is {1, 2, 3, ..., 9, 10}. So, S has 10 numbers in total. Then, 4 numbers are randomly chosen from S. 

Jen wins a prize if at least two of her numbers match the randomly chosen numbers. She wins the grand prize if all four of her numbers match the chosen ones. The question is about finding the probability that she won the grand prize given that she won a prize. They mention this probability is m/n where m and n are coprime, and we need to find m + n.

Hmm, okay. So, this seems like a conditional probability problem. I remember that conditional probability is the probability of an event occurring given that another event has occurred. The formula is P(A|B) = P(A ∩ B) / P(B), where A is the event we're interested in, and B is the condition.

In this case, event A is winning the grand prize (i.e., all four numbers match), and event B is winning a prize, which means at least two numbers match. So, P(A|B) is the probability that she won the grand prize given that she won a prize.

But wait, if she won the grand prize, that means all four numbers matched, which definitely means she also won a prize because she has at least two correct. So, P(A ∩ B) is just P(A), because if A happens, B must also happen. So, in this case, P(A|B) = P(A) / P(B).

Alright, so I need to calculate P(A) and P(B) first.

Let me break it down.

First, the total number of ways to choose 4 numbers from 10 is the combination C(10, 4). I think that's the denominator for all probabilities.

C(10,4) is 10! / (4! * (10-4)!) = (10*9*8*7)/(4*3*2*1) = 210. So, there are 210 possible sets of 4 numbers that can be chosen.

Now, for P(A), which is the probability that all four numbers match. Since Jen has picked her own set, for the grand prize, the randomly chosen numbers must be exactly her set. There's only one such set (hers), so the number of favorable outcomes is 1. Hence, P(A) = 1 / 210.

Next, P(B), the probability that she wins at least two numbers. That means she has exactly 2, 3, or 4 numbers matching. So, I need to calculate the number of ways she can have exactly 2, exactly 3, or exactly 4 numbers matching, sum those up, and then divide by the total number of possible combinations, 210.

Alternatively, since it's sometimes easier, I could calculate the probability of not winning a prize (i.e., having 0 or 1 numbers matching) and subtract that from 1 to get P(B). Let me see which way is better.

But since the problem is about conditional probability, maybe it's better to stick to direct calculation.

Let me think about how to compute the number of ways she can have exactly k matches, where k is 2, 3, or 4.

So, for exactly k matches, we need to choose k numbers from her 4, and the remaining (4 - k) numbers from the numbers she didn't pick. Because the total set S has 10 numbers, and she has 4, so there are 10 - 4 = 6 numbers she didn't pick.

Wait, let me make sure: the problem is that 4 numbers are chosen from S, and Jen has chosen 4 numbers from S as well. So, the randomly chosen 4 numbers can have 0
