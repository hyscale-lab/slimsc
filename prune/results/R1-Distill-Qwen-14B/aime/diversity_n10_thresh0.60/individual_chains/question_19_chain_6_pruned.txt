Okay, so I have this geometry problem here, and I need to find AB multiplied by AC in triangle ABC. The given information is that the circumradius is 13, the inradius is 6, and the incenter I is perpendicular to the circumcenter O. Hmm, that sounds a bit tricky, but let's see if I can figure it out step by step.

First, let me recall some properties of triangle centers. The circumradius R is given as 13, which is the radius of the circumscribed circle around the triangle. The inradius r is 6, which is the radius of the inscribed circle. The incenter I is where the angle bisectors meet, and the circumcenter O is where the perpendicular bisectors meet.

The problem states that IA is perpendicular to OI. So, the line from the incenter I to vertex A is perpendicular to the line connecting the incenter I and the circumcenter O. That seems important. Maybe I can use some vector geometry or coordinate geometry to model this situation.

But before jumping into coordinates, perhaps there are some known formulas or relations involving R, r, and the distances between O and I. I remember there's a formula that relates the distance between the incenter and circumcenter (OI) to other triangle parameters. Let me try to recall that.

Yes, the formula is OI² = R(R - 2r). So, substituting the given values, OI² = 13*(13 - 2*6) = 13*(13 - 12) = 13*1 = 13. So, OI is sqrt(13). That's useful information.

Wait, so OI squared is 13. So, OI is √13. And IA is perpendicular to OI. So, in triangle IOA, angle at I is 90 degrees. So, triangle IOA is right-angled at I.

Let me visualize triangle IOA. Point I is the incenter, O is the circumcenter, and A is the vertex. Since IA is perpendicular to OI, triangle IOA is a right triangle with legs OI and IA, and hypotenuse OA.

Wait, OA is just the circumradius, right? Because O is the circumcenter, so the distance from O to any vertex is R, which is 13. So, OA is 13.

So, in triangle IOA:
- OA = 13 (hypotenuse)
- OI = √13 (one leg)
- IA = ? (other leg)

Since it's a right triangle, I can apply the Pythagorean theorem.

So, IA² + OI² = OA²
IA² + (√13)² = 13²
IA² + 13 = 169
IA² = 169 - 13 = 156
Therefore, IA = sqrt(156). Simplify sqrt(156): 156 = 4*39, so sqrt(4*39)=2*sqrt(39). So, IA is 2√39.

Okay, so IA is 2√39. Now, what's IA in terms of triangle ABC? IA is the length from the incenter to vertex A
