Okay, so I have this math problem here about residents in Aimeville and what they own. I need to find out how many people own all four items: a diamond ring, a set of golf clubs, a garden spade, and a bag of candy hearts. Hmm, let's try to break this down step by step.

First, I'll list out the given information to make it clearer. There are 900 residents in total. The number of people who own each item is as follows:
- Diamond ring: 195
- Golf clubs: 367
- Garden spade: 562
- Candy hearts: Well, it says each of the 900 residents owns a bag of candy hearts, so that's 900 people.

Wait, but candy hearts are something everyone owns. So, everyone has that. So, the other three items (diamond ring, golf clubs, garden spade) are the ones where ownership varies.

Next, I see that 437 residents own exactly two of these things, and 234 own exactly three. Hmm, so these are the counts for exactly two and exactly three items. But I'm being asked about those who own all four. Since everyone owns the candy hearts, owning all four would mean owning the other three plus the candy hearts.

I think I need to use the principle of inclusion-exclusion here. I remember that inclusion-exclusion helps in counting the union of multiple sets by adding the sizes of the sets, subtracting the sizes of all possible intersections, and so on.

But wait, in this problem, each resident owns at least one of the four items, right? Because everyone has the candy hearts. So, the total number of residents is the same as the union of all four sets.

Let me denote the sets as follows:
- D: Diamond ring owners
- G: Golf clubs owners
- S: Garden spade owners
- C: Candy hearts owners (which is everyone, so |C| = 900)

But since everyone owns C, any intersection involving C is just the other set. Because if you take C âˆ© D, that's just D, since all D owners are also C owners.

Wait, that might complicate things. Alternatively, maybe I can model the problem by considering only the three items: D, G, S. Because C is universal. So, owning all four would be owning D,
