Okay, so I have this probability problem to solve. Let me read it again and make sure I understand what's going on.

Jen is entering a lottery by picking 4 distinct numbers from the set S = {1,2,3,...,10}. Then, 4 numbers are randomly chosen from S. She wins a prize if at least two of her numbers match two of the randomly chosen numbers. She wins the grand prize if all four of her numbers are the ones chosen. The question is about finding the probability that she wins the grand prize given that she won a prize. They mention this probability is m/n where m and n are coprime, and we need to find m + n.

Alright, so this is a conditional probability problem. The formula for conditional probability is:

P(A|B) = P(A ∩ B) / P(B)

In this case, event A is Jen winning the grand prize, and event B is her winning a prize. So, since winning the grand prize automatically means she has at least two numbers matching, A is a subset of B. Therefore, P(A ∩ B) is just P(A). So the formula simplifies to P(A)/P(B).

So, I need to compute two probabilities: the probability that Jen wins the grand prize, and the probability that she wins a prize (which includes winning the grand prize). Then, divide those two to get the conditional probability.

Let me figure out how to compute these probabilities.

First, the total number of ways to choose 4 numbers from 10 is the combination C(10,4). So the denominator for both probabilities will be C(10,4).

Calculating C(10,4): 10! / (4! * (10-4)!) = (10*9*8*7)/(4*3*2*1) = 210. So, C(10,4) is 210.

Now, let's compute P(A), the probability of winning the grand prize. That's when all four numbers she picked are the ones chosen. There's only one such combination, right? Because she has to pick exactly the four numbers that are selected. So the number of favorable outcomes is 1. So P(A) = 1 / 210.

Next, compute P(B), the probability of winning a prize, which is having at least two numbers matching. So that includes scenarios where exactly two, exactly three, or exactly four numbers match. Since winning the grand prize is already included, we can sum the probabilities for exactly two, exactly three, and exactly four.

But wait, since it's combinations, maybe it's easier to compute it as 1 minus the probability of having fewer than two matches.

That is, P(B) = 1 - P(0 matches) - P(1 match)

Let me compute P(0 matches) and P(1 match).

P(0 matches): This is the probability that none of Jen's numbers are chosen. So, all four numbers are selected from the remaining 6 numbers (since there are 10 - 4 = 6 numbers not chosen by Jen). So the number of ways to choose 4 numbers from 6 is C(6,4). So the number of favorable outcomes is C(6,4), which is 15. Therefore, P(0 matches) = 15 / 210.

P(1 match): This is the probability that exactly one of Jen's numbers is chosen, and the other three are from the remaining 6. So, the number of ways is C(4,1) * C(6,3). Let me compute that.

C(4,1) is 4, and C(6,3) is 20. So 4 * 20 = 80. Therefore, the number of favorable outcomes is 80, so P(1 match) = 80 / 210.

So, P(B) = 1 - (15/210 + 80/210) = 1 - 95/210 = (210 - 95)/210 = 115/210.

Wait, let me check that. 15 + 80 is 95, yes. 210 - 95 is 115, so 115/210 = probability of winning a prize.

But wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake. Because when I subtract P(0) and P(1) from 1, I get P(2 or more matches), which is the same as P(B). That makes sense.

Alternatively, I could compute P(B) directly by adding P(2), P(3), and P(4).

Let me verify that.

P(2 matches): C(4,2) * C(6,2). C(4,2)=6, C(6,2)=15. So 6*15=90. So P(2 matches)=90/210.

P(3 matches): C(4,3)*C(6,1)=4*6=24. So 24/210.

P(4 matches): 1/210.

So total P(B) = 90 +24 +1 = 115, over 210. So same as before, 115/210. So that's correct.

Therefore, P(A) is 1/210, and P(B) is 115/210.

So the conditional probability P(A|B) is (1/210)/(115/210) = 1/115.

Therefore, the probability is 1/115. So m is 1, n is 115. Are they coprime? Yes, since 1 and 115 share no common factors other than 1. So m + n = 1 + 115 = 116.

Wait, hold on a second. Let me double-check my reasoning.

Wait, is the probability of winning a prize 115/210, which reduces to 23/42? Because 115 divided by 5 is 23, and 210 divided by 5 is 42. So 23/42. But when I computed P(B) as 115/210, that is correct.

Then P(A) is 1/210. So then P(A|B) is (1/210)/(115/210) = 1/115.

Yes, that's correct.

Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in computing P(B). Let me think.

But when I computed P(B) as 1 - P(0) - P(1), I got 115/210. When I directly computed P(2)+P(3)+P(4), I also got 115/210. So that seems solid.

Then, the conditional probability is 1/115.

So the answer is 1/115, which simplifies to 1/115. So m=1, n=115, m + n=116.

I think that's solid. Let me just think if there
