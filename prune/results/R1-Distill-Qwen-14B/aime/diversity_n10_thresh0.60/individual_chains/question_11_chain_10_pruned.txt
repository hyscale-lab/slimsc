Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the largest possible real part of the expression \[(75 + 117i)z + \frac{96 + 144i}{z}\], where \( z \) is a complex number with \( |z| = 4 \). Hmm, complex numbers, real parts, modulus... I remember some basics, but let me try to break it down.

First, let me recall that any complex number \( z \) can be written in the form \( z = a + bi \), where \( a \) and \( b \) are real numbers. But since the modulus of \( z \) is 4, that means \( |z| = \sqrt{a^2 + b^2} = 4 \). So, \( a^2 + b^2 = 16 \). That might come in handy later.

But maybe there's a smarter way than dealing with \( a \) and \( b \) directly. Oh right, another way to represent complex numbers with a given modulus is using polar form. So, \( z = 4e^{i\theta} \), where \( \theta \) is the argument of \( z \). That might simplify things because multiplying and dividing complex numbers in polar form is easier.

Let me rewrite the expression using \( z = 4e^{i\theta} \). First, let's compute \( (75 + 117i)z \). Substituting \( z \):

\( (75 + 117i) \times 4e^{i\theta} = 4(75 + 117i)e^{i\theta} \).

Similarly, the term \( \frac{96 + 144i}{z} \) becomes \( \frac{96 + 144i}{4e^{i\theta}} = \frac{1}{4}(96 + 144i)e^{-i\theta} \).

So, the entire expression is:

\( 4(75 + 117i)e^{i\theta} + \frac{1}{4}(96 + 144i)e^{-i\theta} \).

Hmm, that looks a bit complicated, but maybe I can express these complex numbers in polar form as well. Let me find the modulus and argument of \( 75 + 117i \) and \( 96 + 144i \).

Starting with \( 75 + 117i \). The modulus is \( \sqrt{75^2 + 117^2} \). Let me compute that:

75 squared is 5625, and 117 squared is 13689. Adding them gives 5625 + 13689 = 19314. So, the modulus is \( \sqrt{19314} \). Let me see if that simplifies. 19314 divided by 3 is 6438, divided by 3 again is 2146, which is 2×1073. Hmm, doesn't seem to have any square factors, so it stays as \( \sqrt{19314} \). Approximately, sqrt(19314) is around 139. So, modulus is about 139. But maybe I don't need the approximate value right now.

The argument \( \phi_1 \) is \( \tan^{-1}(117/75) \). 117 divided by 75 is 1.56, so \( \phi_1 \) is approximately 57 degrees or so. Let me compute it more accurately: 75 is 75, 117 is 117. So, 117/75 is 1.56, as I thought. So, \( \phi_1 = \tan^{-1}(1.56) \). Let me see, tan(57) is approximately 1.5399, which is close to 1.56. So, maybe around 57.5 degrees? Not sure, but perhaps exact value isn't needed.

Similarly, for \( 96 + 144i \), modulus is \( \sqrt{96^2 + 144^2} \). 96 squared is 9216, 144 squared is 20736. Adding gives 9216 + 20736 = 300, 300 squared is 90000, so wait, 300 squared is 90,000, so 300,000? Wait, 9216 + 20736 is 300, 300? Let me compute it correctly:

96^2 = (90+6)^2 = 8100 + 1080 + 36 = 9216.

144^2 = (140+4)^2 = 19600 + 1120 + 16 = 20736.

Adding 9216 + 20736: 9216 + 20000 = 29216, plus 736 is 29952.

So, modulus is \( \sqrt{29952} \). Let me see if that simplifies. 29952 divided by 16 is 1872, divided by 16 again is 117. So, sqrt(29952) = sqrt(16*16*117) )= 16*sqrt(117). Because 16*16 is 256, and 29952 is 256*117.

Wait, let me check: 16*16=256. 256*117: 256*100=25600, 256*17=4352, so 25600+4352=29952. Yes, correct. So modulus is 16√117.

What is √117? 117 is 9×13, so √117=3√13. So modulus is 16×3√13=48√13.

Nice, that's a much cleaner expression. So, modulus is 48√13.

The argument \( \phi_2 \) is \( \tan^{-1}(144/96) \). 144/96 is 1.5. So, \( \tan^{-1}(1.5) \). That's approximately 56.3 degrees. Hmm, interesting, similar to the other one.

So, putting it all together, the expression becomes:

\( 4 \times (48√13) e^{i\phi_1} e^{i\theta} + \frac{1}{4} \times 48√13 e^{i\phi_2} e^{-i\theta} \)

Wait, no, that's not exactly right. Let me see:

Wait, \( 75 + 117i \) has modulus sqrt(19314) which I approximated as around 139, but now I think I miscalculated because maybe 75^2 + 117^2 is 5625 + 13689 = 19314, which is correct.

Wait, but 96 + 144i had modulus 48√13. Hmm, but 48√13 is approximately 48*3.6055512755=around 173. So, 48√13 is about 173, which is bigger than 139. Hmm, okay.

But going back, let me write both terms in terms of their polar forms.

First term: \( 4(75 + 117i)e^{i\theta} \) can be written as \( 4 \times (75 + 117i) ( \cos\theta + i \sin\theta ) \).

Second term: \( \frac{1}{4}(96 + 144i)e^{-i\theta} \) is \( \frac{1}{4} (96 + 144i)(\cos\theta - i \sin\theta) \).

So, perhaps I can compute each term's real and imaginary parts and then add them together.

But that might get complicated. Alternatively, perhaps I can write the entire expression in terms of \( e^{i\theta} \) and \( e^{-i\theta} \), then use Euler's formula.

Wait, let me think about the expression:

Let me denote \( A = 75 + 117i \) and \( B = 96 + 144i \). So, the expression is \( 4A z + \frac{B}{z} \).

But \( z=4 e^{i\theta} \), so \( 1/z = (1/4)e^{-i\theta} \).

So, substituting:

\( 4A \times 4 e^{i\theta} + B \times \frac{1}{4} e^{-i\theta} = 16 A e^{i\theta} + \frac{B}{4} e^{-i\theta} \).

So, the expression becomes \( 16A e^{i\theta} + \frac{B}{4} e^{-i\theta} \).

Now, I can write this as \( C e^{i\theta} + D e^{-i\theta} \), where \( C = 16 A \) and \( D = B/4 \).

Now, the real part of this expression is Re(C e^{i\theta} + D e^{-i\theta}) = Re(C e^{i\theta}) + Re(D e^{-i\theta}) = C \cos\theta + D \cos\theta, because Re(e^{i\theta})=cos(theta) and Re(e^{-i\theta})=cos(theta). Wait, no, wait. Let me compute Re(C e^{i\theta}) is C cos(theta) - (Imaginary part of C) sin(theta). Similarly, Re(D e^{-i\theta}) is D cos(theta) + (Imaginary part of D) sin(theta). Hmm, maybe that's a way to approach it.

But perhaps a better approach is to write C and D in polar form.

Let me compute C = 16A = 16*(75 + 117i). So, modulus of C is 16*|A| = 16*sqrt(75^2 + 117^2) = 16*sqrt(19314). Let me compute that:

sqrt(19314) is approximately sqrt(19314) ≈ 139, as before. So, 16*139 ≈ 2224.

Similarly, modulus of D = B/4 = (96 + 144i)/4 = 24 + 36i. So, modulus is sqrt(24^2 + 36^2) = sqrt(576 + 1296) = sqrt(1872). Let's compute that: 1872 = 16*117, so sqrt(16*117)=4*sqrt(117)=4*3*sqrt(13)=12 sqrt(13). So, modulus of D is 12 sqrt(13). Approximately, sqrt(13) is ~3.6055, so 12*3.6055≈43.266.

So, modulus of C is 16*sqrt(19314) ≈ 16*139 ≈ 2224, and modulus of D is 12 sqrt(13) ≈43.266.

The arguments of C and D: since C = 16*(75 + 117i), its argument is the same as A's argument, which is phi1 = tan^{-1}(117/75). Similarly, D = 24 + 36i, so its argument phi2 is tan^{-1}(36/24)=tan^{-1}(1.5). Which is the same as the argument of B. Wait, because B was 96 + 144i, which is 4*(24 + 36i), so same argument.

So, phi1 = tan^{-1}(117/75) ≈tan^{-1}(1.56) ≈57 degrees, and phi2 = tan^{-1}(1.5)≈56.3 degrees.

Wait, that's interesting. The arguments are very close to each other.

So, now, the expression is C e^{i theta} + D e^{-i theta}.

Which can be written as |C| e^{i(phi1
