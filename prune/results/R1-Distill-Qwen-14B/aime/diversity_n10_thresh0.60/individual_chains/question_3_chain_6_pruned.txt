Okay, so I've got this probability problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me try to break it down.

Jen is entering a lottery by picking 4 distinct numbers from the set S, which is {1,2,3,...,9,10}. So, S has 10 numbers in total. Then, 4 numbers are randomly chosen from S. 

She wins a prize if at least two of her numbers match the randomly chosen numbers. And she wins the grand prize if all four of her numbers are the ones chosen. The question is about the probability that she wins the grand prize given that she won a prize. They express this probability as m/n where m and n are coprime, and we need to find m + n.

Hmm, okay, so this is a conditional probability problem. The formula for conditional probability is P(A|B) = P(A ∩ B) / P(B). In this case, event A is winning the grand prize, and event B is winning a prize. Since winning the grand prize automatically means she's won a prize, A is a subset of B. So, P(A ∩ B) is just P(A). So the formula simplifies to P(A)/P(B).

Therefore, the probability we're looking for is (probability of winning the grand prize) divided by (probability of winning a prize).

Let me compute both probabilities.

First, probability of winning the grand prize, P(A). Since Jen picks 4 numbers and all four must match the randomly chosen numbers. The total number of possible ways to choose 4 numbers from 10 is C(10,4). The number of favorable outcomes is 1 (since only one specific set will match her numbers). So P(A) = 1 / C(10,4).

Calculating C(10,4): 10! / (4! * (10-4)!) = (10*9*8*7)/(4*3*2*1) = 210.

So P(A) = 1/210.

Next, the probability of winning a prize, P(B). Winning a prize means that at least two of her numbers are among the four chosen. So, B is the event that the number of matching numbers is 2, 3, or 4.

So, P(B) is the probability of having exactly 2 matches, exactly 3 matches, or exactly 4 matches.

Alternatively, since it's easier sometimes to compute the complement, but in this case, since we need the probability of at least two matches, we can compute it as 1 minus the probability of having fewer than two matches, i.e., 1 - (probability of 0 matches + probability of 1 match).

But maybe computing it directly is straightforward.

So, the total number of ways the lottery can choose 4 numbers is C(10,4) = 210.

The number of favorable outcomes for P(B) is the sum of the number of ways to have exactly 2, 3, or 4 matches.

Let me compute that.

Number of ways to have exactly k matches is C(4,k) * C(6,4−k), because Jen has 4 numbers, so the lottery can choose k of them, and the remaining 4−k numbers must be chosen from the remaining 6 numbers in S.

Wait, hold on: S has 10 numbers, Jen picks 4. So, the numbers not in Jen's set are 10 - 4 = 6 numbers.

So for exactly k matches, the number of ways is C(4,k) * C(6,4−k). Because we choose k numbers from Jen's 4, and 4−k numbers from the remaining 6.

So let's compute this for k = 2, 3, 4.

For k=2: C(4,2)*C(6,2) = 6 * 15 = 90.

For k=3: C(4,3)*C(6,1) = 4 * 6 = 24.

For k=4: C(4,4)*C(6,0) = 1 * 1 = 1.

So total favorable outcomes for B are 90 + 24 + 1 = 115.

Therefore, P(B) = 115 / 210.

But wait, let me double-check these calculations.

Wait, for exactly k=2: C(4,2)=6, C(6,2)=15, so 6*15=90. Correct.

k=3: C(4,3)=4, C(6,1)=6, so 4*6=24. Correct.

k=4: 1. Correct.

Total is 90+24
