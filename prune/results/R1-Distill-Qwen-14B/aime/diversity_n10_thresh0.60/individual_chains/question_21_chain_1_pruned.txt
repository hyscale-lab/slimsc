Okay, so I've got this problem here about b-eautiful numbers. Let me try to parse it step by step. The problem says:

Let b be an integer greater than or equal to 2. A positive integer n is called b-eautiful if two conditions are satisfied:
1. When n is expressed in base b, it has exactly two digits.
2. The sum of these two digits equals the square root of n.

An example is given: 81 is 13-beautiful because in base 13, 81 is written as 63 (since 6*13 + 3 = 81), and 6 + 3 = 9, which is sqrt(81).

The task is to find the least integer b ≥ 2 for which there are more than ten b-eautiful integers.

Hmm. So, I need to find the smallest base b where there are more than ten numbers n that satisfy these two conditions.

Let me try to formalize this. 

First, when a number n has exactly two digits in base b, that means it can be written as n = a*b + c, where a and c are digits in base b. So, a can range from 1 to b-1 (since it's the leading digit, it can't be zero), and c can range from 0 to b-1.

So, n = a*b + c.

The second condition is that the sum of the digits, a + c, must equal sqrt(n). So, a + c = sqrt(n).

Since sqrt(n) must be an integer because a and c are integers. Therefore, n must be a perfect square.

So, n is a perfect square, and n = a*b + c, where a and c are digits in base b. Also, a + c = sqrt(n).

Let me denote s = a + c = sqrt(n). So, s must be an integer, and n = s².

Therefore, n = s² = a*b + c.

But since a and c are digits, we have:
1 ≤ a ≤ b-1,
0 ≤ c ≤ b-1.

So, substituting n = s², we have s² = a*b + c.

But since c is a digit, it's between 0 and b-1, inclusive. So, s² = a*b + c implies that s² ≡ c mod b. But since c is between 0 and b-1, that means c = s² mod b.

Wait, perhaps another way: s² = a*b + c, which can be rewritten as s² = b*a + c, with 1 ≤ a ≤ b-1, 0 ≤ c ≤ b-1.

So, c = s² - a*b.

But since c must satisfy 0 ≤ c ≤ b-1, that implies that s² - a*b must be in that range.

Which gives:

0 ≤ s² - a*b ≤ b - 1.

Which can be rewritten as:

a*b ≤ s² ≤ a*b + (b - 1).

Simplify the upper bound:

a*b ≤ s² ≤ (a + 1)*b - 1.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps I can write s² as a*b + c, with 0 ≤ c < b. So, for each a, c is uniquely determined as c = s² mod b, but since s² must be written as a*b + c.

Wait, maybe it's better to express a in terms of s. Let me think.

From s² = a*b + c, and 1 ≤ a ≤ b-1, 0 ≤ c ≤ b-1.

We can also think of a as the quotient when s² is divided by b, and c as the remainder.

So, a = floor(s² / b), and c = s² mod b.

But because a must be less than b (since a is a digit), this suggests that s² must be less than b*(b), because a is less than b. Wait, n is a two-digit number in base b, so n must be between b and b² - 1.

So, n is in the range [b, b² - 1], which implies that s² is in [b, b² - 1]. Therefore, s must be in [sqrt(b), b - 1], because s is an integer.

So, s can range from ceiling(sqrt(b)) up to floor(b - 1). Wait, but s must be such that s² is at least b. So, s ≥ sqrt(b). Since s is an integer, s ≥ ceil(sqrt(b)).

But also, since n is a two-digit number in base b, the maximum n is (b-1)*b + (b-1) = b² - 1. So, s² ≤ b² -1. Therefore, s ≤ sqrt(b
