Okay, so I've got this math problem here, and I need to find the product of x and y, given that both x and y are greater than 1. The problem says that log base x of y^x equals 10, and log base y of x^{4y} also equals 10. Hmm, let me write that down to keep track.

So, the equations are:
1. log_x(y^x) = 10
2. log_y(x^{4y}) = 10

I remember some logarithm rules. One of them is that log_b(a^c) = c * log_b(a). Maybe I can use that here.

Let's apply that rule to both equations.

For the first equation:
log_x(y^x) = x * log_x(y) = 10

Similarly, for the second equation:
log_y(x^{4y}) = 4y * log_y(x) = 10

So now I have:
1. x * log_x(y) = 10
2. 4y * log_y(x) = 10

Hmm, okay. I also remember that log_b(a) is equal to 1 / log_a(b). So log_x(y) = 1 / log_y(x). That might be useful here.

Let me denote log_x(y) as k. Then log_y(x) would be 1/k.

So substituting into the equations:

1. x * k = 10
2. 4y * (1/k) = 10

That gives me two equations with variables x, y, and k. Maybe I can express x and y in terms of k and then solve for it.

From equation 1:
x = 10 / k

From equation 2:
4y * (1/k) = 10 ⇒ 4y = 10k ⇒ y = (10k) / 4 ⇒ y = (5k)/2

So now I have expressions for x and y in terms of k. But I also know that log_x(y) = k. So I can use that equation to solve for k.

Since log_x(y) = k, it means that x^k = y.

Wait, that's another logarithm rule: if log_b(a) = c, then b^c = a.

So, substituting x and y from earlier:

x = 10/k, y = (5k)/2

So, x^k = y ⇒ (10/k)^k = (5k)/2

Hmm, that's an equation in terms of k. Let me write that:

(10/k)^k = (5k)/2

This seems a bit complicated, but maybe I can take the natural logarithm of both sides to make it easier.

Take ln on both sides:

ln[(10/k)^k] = ln[(5k)/2]

Left side: k * ln(10/k) = k * [ln(10) - ln(k)]
Right side: ln(5k/2) = ln(5) + ln(k) - ln(2)

So now, the equation becomes:

k * (ln(10) - ln(k)) = ln(5) + ln(k) - ln(2)

Hmm, this is a transcendental equation and might not have an algebraic solution. Maybe I can find a value of k that satisfies this.

Alternatively, perhaps I can guess a value for k that simplifies the equation.

Looking at the right side: ln(5) - ln(2) is ln(5/2), so:

k * (ln(10) - ln(k)) = ln(5/2) + ln(k)

Let me rearrange the equation:

k * ln(10) - k * ln(k) - ln(k) - ln(5/2) = 0

Combine like terms:

k * ln(10) - (k + 1) * ln(k) - ln(5/2) = 0

Hmm, this still looks complicated. Maybe I can try plugging in some integer values for k to see if it works.

Let me try k=2.

Plugging into the equation:

2 * ln(10) - (2 + 1) * ln(2) - ln(5/2) = ?

Calculate each term:

2 ln(10) ≈ 2 * 2.302585 ≈ 4.60517
3 ln(2) ≈ 3 * 0.693147 ≈ 2.07944
ln(5/2) ≈ ln(2.5) ≈ 0.916291

So putting it all together:

4.60517 - 2.07944 - 0.916291 ≈ 4.60517 - 3.0 ≈ 1.60517 ≈ Not zero. So k=2 is not the solution.

How about k=1?

Then:

1 * ln(10) - (1 + 1) ln(1) - ln(5/2) = ln(10) - 0 - ln(5/2)

Which is ln(10) - ln(5/2) = ln(10/(5/2)) = ln(4) ≈ 1.386. Not zero.

Hmm, maybe k=3?

k=3:

3 ln(10) -4 ln(3) - ln(5/2)

Compute each term:

3 ln(10) ≈ 3 * 2.302585 ≈ 6.907755
4 ln(3) ≈ 4 * 1.098612 ≈ 4.394448
ln(5/2) ≈ 0.916291

So,

6.907755 - 4.394448 -0.916291 ≈ 6.907755 - 5.310739 ≈ 1.597. Still positive.

Wait, we need the expression to equal zero. So maybe try a larger k?

Wait, but let's think differently. Maybe the value of k is 5? Let me test k=5.

k=5:

5
