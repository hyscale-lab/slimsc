Okay, so I have this geometry problem here. Let me first try to parse it and figure out what's given and what's being asked.

The problem says: Let triangle ABC have circumcenter O and incenter I. It's given that IA is perpendicular to OI. The circumradius is 13, and the inradius is 6. I need to find the product AB·AC.

Alright, let's jot down the given information:

1. Triangle ABC.
2. O is the circumcenter.
3. I is the incenter.
4. IA is perpendicular to OI.
5. Circumradius (R) = 13.
6. Inradius (r) = 6.
7. Find AB · AC.

Hmm. So, I need to find the product of two sides of the triangle, AB and AC.

I remember that in triangle geometry, there are several formulas that relate the inradius, circumradius, sides, angles, etc. Maybe I can use some of those.

First, let's recall that the circumradius R is related to the sides of the triangle by the formula:

R = (a)/(2 sin A) = (b)/(2 sin B) = (c)/(2 sin C)

And the inradius r is related to the area and the semiperimeter:

r = area / s, where s = (a + b + c)/2.

Also, the area can be expressed in terms of R and the sides: area = (a b c)/(4 R).

Wait, but I don't know the sides yet, so maybe that's not directly helpful.

Now, the problem says IA is perpendicular to OI. Hmm. IA is the line from the incenter to vertex A, and OI is the line connecting the incenter to the circumcenter. So, these two lines are perpendicular.

I think this is a key condition that might relate some lengths or angles in the triangle. Maybe I can find some relationship between R, r, and other elements using this condition.

I remember that in a triangle, the distance between the incenter and circumcenter is given by the formula:

OI² = R(R - 2r)

Wait, is that correct? Let me recall. The formula for the distance between the incenter and circumcenter is OI² = R² - 2 R r.

Yes, that's right. So, OI² = R² - 2 R r.

Given that R = 13 and r = 6, let's compute OI.

OI² = 13² - 2*13*6 = 169 - 156 = 13.

So, OI = sqrt(13).

Wait, but the problem states that IA is perpendicular to OI. So, maybe I can consider the triangle formed by points I, A, and O.

Since IA is perpendicular to OI, triangle OIA is a right-angled triangle at I.

So, in triangle OIA, we have:

(OI)² + (IA)² = (OA)²

But wait, OA is the distance from the circumcenter O to vertex A. Since O is the circumradius, OA = R = 13.

So, substituting:

(OI)² + (IA)² = (OA)²
13 + (IA)² = 13²
13 + (IA)² = 169
(IA)² = 169 - 13 = 156
IA = sqrt(156) = 2*sqrt(39)

Hmm, interesting. So, the length of IA is 2*sqrt(39). But I don't know if that helps me directly.

Wait, in a triangle, the length of the inradius from the incenter to a vertex can be expressed in terms of the triangle's elements. Let me recall the formula for IA.

I think the formula for the length of the inradius from the incenter to vertex A is:

IA = (r)/(sin(A/2))

Is that correct? Let me think. Yes, because the inradius is related to the angles. The inradius is the distance from the incenter to each side, but the distance from the incenter to a vertex would involve the angle bis
