Okay, so I have this problem where there are four points A, B, C, D on a hyperbola given by the equation x²/20 - y²/24 = 1. These four points form a rhombus ABCD, and the diagonals of the rhombus intersect at the origin. I need to find the greatest real number that is less than BD² for all such rhombuses. Hmm, that sounds a bit tricky, but let's try to break it down step by step.

First, let me recall what a rhombus is. A rhombus is a quadrilateral with all sides equal in length, and its diagonals bisect each other at right angles. Wait, no, actually, in a rhombus, the diagonals bisect each other and the angles, but they aren't necessarily perpendicular unless it's a square. Oh, wait, no, actually, in a rhombus, the diagonals are not necessarily perpendicular, but they do bisect each other at right angles. Wait, no, that's a square. Wait, no, in a rhombus, the diagonals are not necessarily perpendicular, but in a square, which is a special case of a rhombus, they are. Hmm, maybe I confused something.

Wait, actually, let me double-check. In a rhombus, the diagonals bisect the vertex angles, and they intersect at right angles. Wait, no, is that true? Let me think. No, in a rhombus, the diagonals are not necessarily perpendicular. Wait, no, I think that's a square. Wait, actually, no, in a rhombus, the diagonals are not perpendicular, but in a square, which is a rhombus, they are.

Wait, no, I think I might be wrong. Let me recall. Oh, no, actually, in a rhombus, the diagonals are perpendicular. Yes, that's right. So, in a rhombus, the diagonals are perpendicular bisectors of each other. So, that's an important property. So, for this problem, the diagonals AC and BD intersect at the origin, and they are perpendicular to each other.

So, given that, the rhombus ABCD has its diagonals intersecting at the origin, and the diagonals are perpendicular. So, the diagonals are perpendicular and bisect each other. So, if the diagonals are AC and BD, then the origin is their midpoint.

So, each diagonal is a line passing through the origin, and they intersect at the origin at 90 degrees. So, each vertex of the rhombus lies on one of these diagonals.

Now, since all four points lie on the hyperbola x²/20 - y²/24 = 1, I need to find the coordinates of A, B, C, D such that they form a rhombus with diagonals intersecting at the origin.

Let me think about the parametrization of the points. Since the hyperbola is symmetric with respect to both axes, and the diagonals pass through the origin, perhaps points A and C are on one diagonal, and points B and D are on the other diagonal.

Let me denote the diagonals as AC and BD. Since the diagonals are perpendicular, if one diagonal has a slope m, the other will have a slope -1/m. But since both diagonals pass through the origin, their equations will be y = m x and y = (-1/m) x.

But wait, actually, the hyperbola x²/20 - y²/24 = 1 is symmetric with respect to both the x-axis and y-axis, as well as the lines y = x and y = -x. So, the diagonals could be along these lines.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to consider the diagonals as axes, and parameterize the points accordingly.

Wait, maybe it's better to assign coordinates to the points. Let's say that points A and C are along one diagonal, and points B and D are along the other diagonal.

Since the diagonals are perpendicular, if one diagonal is along the line y = k x, the other is along y = (-1/k) x.

But since hyperbola is given, maybe it's better to parameterize points on the hyperbola.

Wait, perhaps I can represent the points in terms of parametric equations of the hyperbola. For a hyperbola of the form x²/a² - y²/b² = 1, a parametrization can be x = a secθ, y = b tanθ. Alternatively, another parametrization is x = a cosh t, y = b sinh t. Hmm, but hyperbolic functions might complicate things. Maybe stick with trigonometric parametrization since it's symmetric.

Wait, but hyperbola parametrization using secant and tangent is x = a secθ, y = b tanθ. Let me try that.

So, let's denote point A as (a secθ, b tanθ), then point C, being the other end of the diagonal, would be the reflection of A through the origin, since the origin is the midpoint. So, point C would be (-a secθ, -b tanθ).

Similarly, points B and D would be on the other diagonal, which is perpendicular to AC. So, if AC is along some line, BD is along the perpendicular line.

Wait, but for diagonals intersecting at the origin and being perpendicular, the product of their slopes is -1. So, if the slope of AC is m, then the slope of BD is -1/m.

So, if point A is (a secθ, b tanθ), then the slope of AC is (b tanθ)/(a secθ) = (b/a) sinθ. Therefore, the slope of BD would be - (a/b) / sinθ.

Hmm, but maybe that's complicating things. Alternatively, perhaps it's better to represent points B and D in terms of another parameter.

Wait, since the diagonals are perpendicular, and they pass through the origin, the coordinates of B and D can be represented as (p, q) and (-p, -q) respectively, such that the line BD has a slope perpendicular to AC's slope.

So, suppose that point A is (x, y), then point C is (-x, -y). Then, the diagonal AC has a direction vector (x, y). Then, the diagonal BD must have a direction vector perpendicular to (x, y), so it's direction vector would be (-y, x) or (y, -x), to be perpendicular.

So, points B and D would lie along the line through the origin with direction vector (-y, x). So, points B and D can be written as t*(-y, x) and -t*(-y, x) = (t y, -t x) for some parameter t.

Wait, let me check that. If the direction vector perpendicular to (x, y) is (-y, x), then points along this direction would be of the form ( -y * s, x * s ), where s is a parameter. So, points B and D would be ( -y s, x s ) and ( y s, -x s ), respectively.

But wait, in that case, the coordinates of B would be ( -y s, x s ) and D would be ( y s, -x s ). Alternatively, if the direction vector is (y, -x), then points would be (y s, -x s ) and (-y s, x s ). Either way, points B and D are scalar multiples along the perpendicular direction.

Now, since points A, B, C, D lie on the hyperbola, their coordinates must satisfy the hyperbola equation.

So, let's write down the coordinates:

Point A: (x, y) => x²/20 - y²/24 = 1.

Point C: (-x, -y) => same as point A.

Point B: ( -y s, x s ) => ( (-y s)^2 ) / 20 - ( (x s)^2 ) /24 =1.

Similarly, Point D: ( y s, -x s ) => same as point B because substituting s with -s would give the same equation.

So, for point B:

( (-y s )² ) /20 - ( (x s )² ) /24 =1.

Which simplifies to (y² s²)/20 - (x² s²)/24 =1.

Factor out s²: s² [ y² /20 - x² /24 ] =1.

But we know from point A that x²/20 - y²/24 =1.

So, let me denote that as equation (1):

x²/20 - y²/24 =1.

So, for point B, we have s² [ y² /20 - x² /24 ] =1.

Let me denote the expression inside the brackets as E = y² /20 - x² /24.

So, s² E =1.

But from equation (1), x²/20 - y²/24 =1.

Let me compute E: E = y²/20 - x²/24.

Let me relate E and equation (1). Let me write equation (1) as x²/20 =1 + y²/24.

So, E = y²/20 - (1 + y²/24).

Simplify E: y²/20 -1 - y²/24.

Compute y²(1/20 - 1/24) -1.

Compute 1/20 - 1/24: find a common denominator, which is 120. So 1/20 = 6/120, 1/24 = 5/120. So 6/120 -5/120=1/120.

Thus, E = y²*(1/120) -1.

So, E = (y²)/120 -1.

So, going back to point B's equation: s² E =1.

Which is s² [ (y²)/120 -1 ] =1.

So, s² = 1 / [ (y²)/120 -1 ].

But let me note that from equation (1):

x²/20 - y²/24 =1 => x² =20(1 + y²/24).

So, x² =20 + (20 y²)/24 =20 + (5 y²)/6.

So, x² =20 + (5 y²)/6.

Let me compute E again: (y²)/120 -1.

So, s² =1 / [ (y²)/120 -1 ].

But since s² must be positive (as it's a square of a real number), the denominator must be positive.

So, (y²)/120 -1 >0 => y² >120.

Thus, y² must be greater than 120.

So, s² =1 / [ (y² -120)/120 ] =120/(y² -120).

So, s²=120/(y² -120).

But let's also note that point B must lie on the hyperbola, so its coordinates satisfy the hyperbola equation.

Wait, but we've already used that to get s². So, perhaps we can now find a relation between s and the coordinates of point A.

Alternatively, perhaps we can relate x and y from point A, and express everything in terms of one variable.

Let me see: from equation (1), x² =20 + (5 y²)/6.

So, x² = (120 +5 y²)/6.

So, x² =5(24 + y²)/6.

Wait, maybe express x in terms of y or vice versa.

Alternatively, perhaps express everything in terms of t, where y = t x.

Wait, let me think. Alternatively, perhaps express y in terms of x.

Wait, let me compute E in terms of x.

From equation (1): x²/20 - y²/24 =1.

So, y² =24*(x²/20 -1)=24*(x² -20)/20= (24/20)(x² -20)= (6/5)(x² -20).

So, y²= (6/5)(x² -20).

So, E = (y²)/120 -1 = [ (6/5)(x² -20) ] /120 -1= [ (6(x² -20)) /5 ] /120 -1= (6(x² -20))/(5*120) -1= (6(x² -20))/(600) -1= (x² -20)/100 -1.

So, E= (x² -20)/100 -1= x²/100 -20/100 -1= x²/100 - 1/5 -1= x²/100 -6/5.

So, s²=1/E=1/[x²/100 -6/5] =1/[ (x² -120)/100 ]=100/(x² -120).

But from equation (1), x²=20 + (5 y²)/6. Wait, but perhaps I can relate this back to s².

Wait, so s²=100/(x² -120).

But since x² must be greater than 120 for s² to be positive, as we saw earlier.

So, x² >120.

So, now, in terms of x, s²=100/(x² -120).

Now, let's think about the rhombus. The diagonals are AC and BD. The lengths of the diagonals can be found as follows.

The length of diagonal AC is the distance between A and C. Since A is (x, y) and C is (-x, -y), the distance AC is sqrt( (2x)^2 + (2y)^2 )=2 sqrt(x² + y²).

Similarly, the length of diagonal BD is the distance between B and D. Since B is (-y s, x s) and D is (y s, -x s), the distance BD is sqrt( (2 y s)^2 + (2 x s)^2 )=2 s sqrt(y² +x²).

Wait, that's interesting. So, both diagonals have lengths proportional to sqrt(x² + y²). Hmm, but let's compute BD squared.

BD squared is [2 s sqrt(x² + y²)]²=4 s² (x² + y²).

So, BD²=4 s² (x² + y²).

But we have s²=100/(x² -120).

So, BD²=4*(100/(x² -120))*(x² + y²).

Now, let's compute x² + y². From equation (1), y²= (6/5)(x² -20).

So, x² + y²= x² + (6/5)(x² -20)=x² + (6x²)/5 -24= (5x² +6x²)/5 -24= (11x²)/5 -24.

So, BD²=4*(100/(x² -120))*(11x²/5 -24).

Simplify this expression:

BD²=4*(100/(x² -120))*(11x²/5 -24).

Let me compute the constants first. 4*100=400. So, 400/(x² -120)*(11x²/5 -24).

Let me write 11x²/5 -24 as (11x² -120)/5.

So, BD²=400/(x² -120) * (11x² -120)/5.

Simplify this:

400/5=80, so BD²=80*(11x² -120)/(x² -120).

So, BD²=80*(11x² -120)/(x² -120).

We can factor numerator and denominator:

Numerator:11x² -120=11(x² -120/11).

Denominator:x² -120.

So, BD²=80*[11(x² -120/11)]/(x² -120).

=80*11*(x² -120/11)/(x² -120).

=880*(x² -120/11)/(x² -120).

Hmm, perhaps factor (x² -120/11) and (x² -120).

Wait, let me write (x² -120) as (x² -120/11 - 100/11)= (x² -120/11) - 100/11.

Not sure if that helps.

Alternatively, perhaps express it as 880*( (x² -120) + (120 -120/11) )/(x² -120).

Wait, 120 -120/11= (1320 -120)/11=1200/11.

So, 880*( (x² -120) + 1200/11 )/(x² -120).

=880*[1 + (1200/11)/(x² -120)].

=880 + 880*(1200)/(11(x² -120)).

=880 + (880*1200)/(11(x² -120)).

Simplify 880/11=80. So, 80*1200=96,000.

So, BD²=880 + 96,000/(x² -120).

Hmm, that seems a bit complicated, but perhaps we can consider BD² as a function of x², let's say let u = x².

Since x²>120, as established earlier, u>120.

So, BD²=80*(11u -120)/(u -120).

=80*(11(u -120/11))/(u -120).

=80*11*(u -120/11)/(u -120).

=880*(u -120/11)/(u -120).

Hmm, perhaps express this as 880*(1 - (120/11)/(u -120)).

Wait, let me compute:

(u -120/11)/(u -120)= [ (u -120) + 120 -120/11 ] / (u -120).

= [ (u -120) + (1320 -120)/11 ] / (u -120).

= [ (u -120) + 1200/11 ] / (u -120).

=1 + (1200/11)/(u -120).

So, BD²=880*(1 + (1200/11)/(u -120)).

=880 + (880*1200)/(11(u -120)).

Again, 880/11=80, so BD²=880 + (80*1200)/(u -120).

80*1200=96,000.

So, BD²=880 +96,000/(u -120).

Hmm, so BD² is expressed in terms of u=x², which is greater than 120.

So, BD²=880 +96,000/(u -120).

Now, to find the minimum possible BD², since we need the greatest real number that is less than BD² for all such rhombuses. So, we need the infimum of BD².

Wait, the problem says to find the greatest real number that is less than BD² for all such rhombuses. So, that would be the infimum (greatest lower bound) of BD². Because we need a number that's less than BD² for all rhombuses, and as large as possible.

So, if I can find the minimum possible value of BD², then the greatest number less than BD² for all rhombuses would be the infimum of BD², which, if BD² has a minimum, would be that minimum.

Alternatively, if BD² can approach a certain limit from above, then that limit would be the infimum.

So, let's analyze BD² as a function of u.

BD²=880 +96,000/(u -120), where u>120.

So, as u approaches 120 from above, the term 96,000/(u -120) approaches infinity, so BD² approaches infinity.

As u approaches infinity, 96,000/(u -120) approaches 0, so BD² approaches 880.

So, BD² can be made arbitrarily large as u approaches 120, but it approaches 880 as u increases.

But wait, that seems contradictory because, as u increases, BD² approaches 880, which would be the lower bound.

Wait, so the minimum value of BD² is 880, approached as u goes to infinity.

But let me check: when u is very large, x² is very large, so point A is very far along the x-axis. Then, point B would be on the other diagonal, which is perpendicular. Since x is large, y²= (6/5)(x² -20)≈ (6/5)x². So, y is approximately sqrt(6/5)x. So, the points would be far away but on the hyperbola.

Wait, but as u increases, BD² approaches 880, so 880 is the infimum of BD².

But let's see whether BD² can actually attain 880. Since as u approaches infinity, BD² approaches 880, but never actually reaches it. So, 880 is the infimum, meaning the greatest lower bound, but BD² is always greater than 880.

Therefore, the greatest real number that is less than BD² for all such rhombuses would be 880.

Wait, but let me verify this.

Wait, if BD² approaches 880 as u increases, then for any epsilon>0, there exists a rhombus where BD² is less than 880 + epsilon. But since BD² can't be less than 880, because as u approaches infinity, BD² approaches 880, and for finite u, BD² is greater than 880.

Wait, no. Wait, when u approaches infinity, BD² approaches 880 from above. So, BD² is always greater than 880. So, 880 is the infimum, but it's not attained. Therefore, the greatest number less than BD² for all rhombuses is 880, because BD² is always larger than 880.

But wait, the problem says "the greatest real number that is less than BD² for all such rhombi." So, if BD² can be made arbitrarily close to 880, but never less than 880, then 880 is the infimum. So, 880 is the greatest lower bound.

Therefore, the answer should be 880.

Wait, but let me re-express BD² in terms of x² to make sure I didn't make a mistake.

Wait, earlier, I had:

BD²=80*(11x² -120)/(x² -120).

Which I rewrote as 80*(11(x² -120/11))/(x² -120).

=80*11*(x² -120/11)/(x² -120).

=880*(x² -120/11)/(x² -120).

Hmm, maybe I can write this as 880*(1 - (120/11)/(x² -120)).

Wait, no, that's not correct.

Wait, let me compute (x² -120/11)/(x² -120).

Let me write x² -120 = (x² -120/11) - 100/11.

So, (x² -120/11)/(x² -120)= [ (x² -120) + (120 -120/11) ] / (x² -120).

=1 + (120 -120/11)/(x² -120).

120 -120/11= (1320 -120)/11=1200/11.

So, (x² -120/11)/(x² -120)=1 + (1200/11)/(x² -120).

Therefore, BD²=880*(1 + (1200/11)/(x² -120)).

=880 + (880*1200)/(11(x² -120)).

=880 + (80*1200)/(x² -120).

Which is the same as before.

So, as x² approaches infinity, BD² approaches 880.

Thus, BD² can be made as close to 880 as desired by taking x² very large, but it's always greater than 880.

Therefore, the greatest real number less than BD² for all such rhombuses is 880.

So, the answer is 880.

**Final Answer**
\boxed{880}


Given a hyperbola \(\frac{x^2}{20} - \frac{y^2}{24} = 1\) with points \(A\), \(B\), \(C\), and \(D\) forming a rhombus whose diagonals intersect at the origin, we need to find the greatest real number that is less than \(BD^2\) for all such rhombuses.

1. **Hyperbola Parametrization**:
   - Points \(A\) and \(C\) are on the hyperbola, with coordinates \((x, y)\) and \((-x, -y)\) respectively.
   - The equation of the hyperbola gives \(x^2/20 - y^2/24 = 1\).

2. **Diagonals and Slopes**:
   - Diagonals \(AC\) and \(BD\) are perpendicular and bisect each other at the origin.
   - Points \(B\) and \(D\) lie on the line perpendicular to \(AC\) through the origin.

3. **Coordinates of Points**:
   - Points \(B\) and \(D\) can be parameterized as \((-ys, xs)\) and \((ys, -xs)\) respectively, where \(s\) is a scalar.

4. **Hyperbola Equation for Points \(B\) and \(D\)**:
   - Substituting the coordinates of \(B\) into the hyperbola equation, we find:
     \[
     \frac{(ys)^2}{20} - \frac{(xs)^2}{24} = 1
     \]
   - Simplifying, we get \(s^2 \left( \frac{y^2}{20} - \frac{x^2}{24} \right) = 1\).

5. **Expression for \(s^2\)**:
   - Using the hyperbola equation for \(A\), we find:
     \[
     s^2 = \frac{120}{y^2 - 120}
     \]

6. **Length of Diagonal \(BD\)**:
   - The length of \(BD\) is given by:
     \[
     BD^2 = 4s^2 (x^2 + y^2)
     \]
   - Substituting \(s^2\) and simplifying, we find:
     \[
     BD^2 = 80 \left( \frac{11x^2 - 120}{x^2 - 120} \right)
     \]

7. **Simplification and Limit**:
   - As \(x^2\) approaches infinity, \(BD^2\) approaches 880.
   - Therefore, the greatest real number less than \(BD^2\) for all such rhombuses is 880.

\[
\boxed{880}
\]
