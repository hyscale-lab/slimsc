Okay, so I have this geometry problem here. Let me try to understand it step by step. The problem says:

Let triangle ABC have circumcenter O and incenter I with IA perpendicular to OI, circumradius 13, and inradius 6. Find ABÂ·AC.

Hmm. So, I need to find the product of sides AB and AC in triangle ABC, given some specific conditions about the circumradius, inradius, and the perpendicularity of IA and OI.

First, let me recall some properties and formulas related to triangle centers and radii.

The circumradius R is given as 13, and the inradius r is 6. Also, IA is perpendicular to OI. That seems like an important condition that might relate to some specific theorem or formula.

I remember that in a triangle, the distance between the incenter (I) and the circumcenter (O) is given by the formula:

OI = sqrt(R(R - 2r))

Where R is the circumradius and r is the inradius. Let me compute that:

OI = sqrt(13*(13 - 2*6)) = sqrt(13*(13 -12)) = sqrt(13*1) = sqrt(13)

So, OI is sqrt(13). Got that.

Now, the problem states that IA is perpendicular to OI. That is, the segment from I to A is perpendicular to the segment from O to I.

So, triangle IAO is a right-angled triangle at I. So, in triangle IAO, angle at I is 90 degrees.

Therefore, by Pythagoras theorem:

IA^2 + OI^2 = OA^2.

We know OI is sqrt(13), so OI^2 = 13. OA is the circumradius, which is 13. So OA^2 is 169.

So:

IA^2 + 13 = 169 => IA^2 = 169 -13 = 156 => IA = sqrt(156) = 2*sqrt(39)

So, IA is 2*sqrt(39).

Hmm. Now, IA is the length of the inradius from incenter I to vertex A. Wait, no, the inradius is the distance from I to the sides, not the vertices. So IA is not the inradius but the length from the incenter to vertex A.

I think there's a formula for the length of the segment from the incenter to a vertex. Let me recall.

Yes, the formula for the length from the incenter to vertex A is:

IA = sqrt(r^2 + (s - a)^2)

Where r is the inradius, s is the semiperimeter, and a is the side BC.

Alternatively, another formula I remember is:

IA = (r)/(sin(A/2))

Wait, let me check that. For a triangle, the distance from the inradius to vertex A can be expressed in terms of the angle at A. Since the inradius forms a right angle with the angle bisector, perhaps?

Wait, perhaps it's better to use the formula IA = (r)/(sin(A/2)). Because in the inradius, the distance from the incenter to the vertex can be related to the angle.

Wait, let me
