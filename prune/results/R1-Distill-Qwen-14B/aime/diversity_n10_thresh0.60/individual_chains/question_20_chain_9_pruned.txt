Okay, so I've got this problem where I need to figure out the number of ways to place some chips on a 5x5 grid. The chips can be either white or black, and they're indistinguishable except for their color. There are 25 white chips and 25 black chips available, but I don't have to use all of them. The conditions are a bit specific, so I need to unpack each one carefully.

First, the grid is 5x5, which means 25 cells. Each cell can hold at most one chip. So, no two chips in the same cell, which is straightforward.

The next condition is that all chips in the same row must be the same color, and all chips in the same column must also be the same color. Hmm, that's interesting. So, for any given row, if there's a white chip in it, all the other chips in that row, if any, have to be white too. Same goes for black. The same applies to columns. So each row and each column must be uniformly colored if they have any chips.

Wait, but that might not be the case. Let me think again. The condition says all chips in the same row must have the same color. So, if a row has any chips, they all must be the same color. Similarly for columns. So, for example, if I have a row with some chips, they're all white or all black. The same applies to columns.

But then, the third condition says that any additional chip placed would violate one or more of the previous two conditions. So, the placement must be such that it's already maximal; you can't add any more chips without breaking the row or column uniformity.

So the problem is asking for the number of such maximal placements.

Let me think about how such a grid would look. Each row and each column can have chips, but once a row has a chip, all chips in that row must be the same color. Similarly for columns. So, the grid is divided into regions where certain rows and columns are colored either white or black, but with the condition that if a row is colored, say white, then all the cells in that row must be white. Similarly for columns.

Wait, but that's a bit conflicting because a cell is at the intersection of a row and a column. So, if a row is white, all its cells must be white, but if a column is black, all its cells must be black. So, how can a cell belong to both a white row and a black column? It can't. So, perhaps the coloring is such that the entire grid forms a sort of partition based on rows and columns.

Wait, maybe this is similar to a bipartition of the grid into blocks where each block is a rectangle covered by rows and columns that are colored.

Alternatively, perhaps each row is independently colored white or black, and each column is independently colored white or black, but their intersections must satisfy that a cell can only be white if both its row and column are white, or black if both are black. Wait, but that can't be because if a cell is white, that implies the entire row is white and the entire column is white, which would require all the cells in that row and column to be white, which would mean the entire grid is white, which
