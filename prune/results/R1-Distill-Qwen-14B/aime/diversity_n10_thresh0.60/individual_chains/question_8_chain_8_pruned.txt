Okay, so I need to figure out how many triples of nonnegative integers (a, b, c) satisfy the equations a + b + c = 300 and a²b + a²c + b²a + b²c + c²a + c²b = 6,000,000. Hmm, let me break this down step by step.

First, the problem involves two equations and three variables. I know that in such cases, sometimes symmetry can help. Let me look at the second equation. It looks a bit complicated, but maybe I can factor it or rewrite it in a more manageable way.

Looking at the terms in the second equation: a²b + a²c + b²a + b²c + c²a + c²b. Hmm, each term is a product of two variables where one is squared. Maybe I can factor out some common terms. Let's see:

a²b + a²c = a²(b + c)
Similarly, b²a + b²c = b²(a + c)
And c²a + c²b = c²(a + b)

So the entire expression becomes:
a²(b + c) + b²(a + c) + c²(a + b)

Hmm, that's a bit better. Now, since a + b + c = 300, maybe I can express each (b + c), (a + c), and (a + b) in terms of 300 - a, 300 - b, and 300 - c respectively. Let me try that.

So, substituting:
a²(300 - a) + b²(300 - b) + c²(300 - c) = 6,000,000

Expanding each term:
300a² - a³ + 300b² - b³ + 300c² - c³ = 6,000,000

Let me group the terms:
300(a² + b² + c²) - (a³ + b³ + c³) = 6,000,000

Hmm, that's a useful form. Now, I also know from the first equation that a + b + c = 300. Maybe I can find expressions for a² + b² + c² and a³ + b³ + c³ in terms of other symmetric sums.

I remember that (a + b + c)² = a² + b² + c² + 2(ab + ac + bc). So, since a + b + c = 300, we have:

300² = a² + b² + c² + 2(ab + ac + bc)
Which is 90,000 = a² + b² + c² + 2(ab + ac + bc)

Let me denote S = a + b + c = 300
Let P = ab + ac + bc
And Q = a² + b² + c²

So from the above equation:
Q + 2P = 90,000

So, Q = 90,000 - 2P

Now, looking back at the second equation, which is:
300Q - (a³ + b³ + c³) = 6,000,000

I need to express a³ + b³ + c³ in terms of S, P, and perhaps Q. I remember that there's a formula for a³ + b³ + c³.

Yes, the formula is:
a³ + b³ + c³ = (a + b + c)³ - 3(a + b + c)(ab + ac + bc) + 3abc

So, substituting S, P, and the term 3abc:

a³ + b³ + c³ = S³ - 3SP + 3abc

Now, plugging this into the second equation:

300Q - (S³ - 3SP + 3abc) = 6,000,000

We know S is 300, so S³ is 300³ = 27,000,000

So substituting:

300Q - (27,000,000 - 3*300*P + 3abc) = 6,000,000

Let me simplify this:

300Q - 27,000,000 + 900P - 3abc = 6,000,000

Rearranging terms:

300Q + 900P - 3abc = 6,000,000 + 27,000,000
300Q + 900P - 3abc = 33,000,000

Hmm, okay. Now, from before, Q = 90,000 - 2P. Let's substitute that in:

300*(90,000 - 2P) + 900P - 3abc = 33,000,000

Calculating 300*90,000 = 27,000,000 and 300*(-2P) = -600P

So:

27,000,000 - 600P + 900P - 3abc = 33,000,000

Combine like terms:

27,000,000 + 300P - 3abc = 33,000,000

Subtract 27,000,000 from both sides:

300P - 3abc = 6,000,000

Divide both sides by 3:

100P - abc = 2,000,000

So, 100P - abc = 2,000,000.

Hmm. So now I have an equation involving P and abc.

Let me write that again:

100P - abc = 2,000,000.

So, 100P = abc + 2,000,000.

I need to find integer triples (a, b, c) where a + b + c = 300, and 100(ab + ac + bc) = abc + 2,000,000.

Hmm, that seems tricky. Maybe I can express P in terms of abc.

Let me rearrange the equation:

abc = 100P - 2,000,000.

But I also know that P = ab + ac + bc.

Wait, perhaps I can find a relationship between a, b, and c. Maybe assume some ordering, like a ≤ b ≤ c, to reduce the cases.

But before that, perhaps I can factor the equation 100P - abc = 2,000,000.

Let me write it as:

abc - 100P = -2,000,000.

Hmm, not sure if that helps. Maybe I can factor 100:

abc - 100(ab + ac + bc) = -2,000,000.

Hmm, maybe I can factor:

abc - 100ab - 100ac - 100bc = -2,000,000

Factor terms:

ab(c - 100) - 100c(a + b) = -2,000,000

But since a + b + c = 300, then a + b = 300 - c.

So, substituting:

ab(c - 100) - 100c(300 - c) = -2,000,000

Hmm, maybe this is helpful. Let's write that out:

ab(c - 100) = 100c(300 - c) - 2,000,000

Hmm, let's compute 100c(300 - c):

100c(300 - c) = 30,000c - 100c²

So, the equation becomes:

ab(c - 100) = 30,000c - 100c² - 2,000,000

Let me factor 100 on the right side:

= 100(300c - c²) - 2,000,000

Hmm, not sure. Alternatively, perhaps express ab in terms of the other variables.

Wait, since a + b = 300 - c, I can express ab in terms of a and b.

But perhaps I can write ab as [(a + b)^2 - (a^2 + b^2)] / 2. But I don't know a² + b².

Alternatively, let me consider that ab is a symmetric function.

Wait, maybe I can express ab in terms of c since a + b = 300 - c. Let me denote s = a + b = 300 - c and t = ab.

Then, the equation becomes:

t(c - 100) = 30,000c - 100c² - 2,000,000

So, t = [30,000c - 100c² - 2,000,000] / (c - 100)

Hmm, perhaps I can perform polynomial division on the numerator.

Let me factor the numerator:

30,000c - 100c² - 2,000,000 = -100c² + 30,000c - 2,000,000

Let
