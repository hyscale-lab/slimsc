Okay, so I have this math problem to solve. Let me try to understand it step by step.

The problem says: Let N be the greatest four-digit positive integer with the property that whenever one of its digits is changed to 1, the resulting number is divisible by 7. Then, I need to find Q and R, which are the quotient and remainder when N is divided by 1000. Finally, I have to find Q + R.

Hmm, so N is a four-digit number. Let me denote it as ABCD, where A, B, C, D are its digits. Since it's a four-digit number, A can't be zero. So A is between 1 and 9, and B, C, D are between 0 and 9.

The key property here is that if I change any one of its digits to 1, the resulting number is divisible by 7. So, for example, changing A to 1 gives a number where the first digit is 1, and the rest are original. Similarly, changing B to 1, C to 1, or D to 1 each gives a different number, all of which must be divisible by 7.

Since N is the greatest such number, I should aim to find the largest possible four-digit number ABCD that satisfies this condition. So, starting from 9999 and going down, checking each number to see if it meets the criteria. But that might take a very long time.

Alternatively, maybe I can figure out constraints on the digits A, B, C, D based on the divisibility by 7 when any single digit is changed to 1.

Let me think about each digit position:

1. Changing A to 1: The number becomes 1BCD. So, 1BCD must be divisible by 7.

2. Changing B to 1: The number becomes A1CD. So, A1CD must be divisible by 7.

3. Changing C to 1: The number becomes AB1D. So, AB1D must be divisible by 7.

4. Changing D to 1: The number becomes ABC1. So, ABC1 must be divisible by 7.

So, for each of these modified numbers, they must be divisible by 7. Therefore, N itself is close to these multiples of 7, differing only in one digit changed to 1.

Wait, but N is the original number, and changing any digit to 1 gives a multiple of 7. So, perhaps N is just a number where each digit is such that when changed to 1, the number becomes a multiple of 7.

I need to find N such that:

1. 1BCD ≡ 0 mod 7
2. A1CD ≡ 0 mod 7
3. AB1D ≡ 0 mod 7
4. ABC1 ≡ 0 mod 7

So, N is the four-digit number ABCD. So, each of these four modified numbers is a multiple of 7.

Since I'm looking for the largest such N, maybe I can approach this by considering each digit position and figuring out what constraints it must satisfy.

Let me think about each case:

1. When A is changed to 1: 1BCD ≡ 0 mod 7.

So, N minus (A - 1)*1000 must be ≡ 0 mod 7. Because changing the first digit from A to 1 subtracts (A - 1)*1000 from N.

Similarly, for the other digit changes:

2. Changing B to 1: N - (B - 1)*100 ≡ 0 mod 7.

3. Changing C to 1: N - (C - 1)*10 ≡ 0 mod 7.

4. Changing D to 1: N - (D - 1) ≡ 0 mod 7.

So, each of these operations subtracts a certain amount from N, and the result must be divisible by 7.

Which gives me four equations:

1. N - (A - 1)*1000 ≡ 0 mod 7

2. N - (B - 1)*100 ≡ 0 mod 7

3. N - (C - 1)*10 ≡ 0 mod 7

4. N - (D - 1) ≡ 0 mod 7

Alternatively, since these are congruencies, I can write:

1. N ≡ (A - 1)*1000 mod 7

2. N ≡ (B - 1)*100 mod 7

3. N ≡ (C - 1)*10
