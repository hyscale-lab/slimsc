Okay, so I have this problem where Alice chooses a set A of positive integers. Then Bob lists all finite nonempty sets B of positive integers such that the maximum element of B is in A. Bob's list has 2024 sets. I need to find the sum of the elements of A.

Hmm, let's break this down. So, A is some set of positive integers. Bob is making a list of all finite non-empty sets B where the maximum element of B is in A. The number of such sets is 2024. I have to figure out what A is and then sum its elements.

First, I should understand what kind of sets B Bob is considering. Each set B is finite, non-empty, and consists of positive integers. The key is that the maximum element of B is in A. So, for each element a in A, how many sets B can have a as their maximum?

Wait, yes. Let's think about that. For a given a in A, the sets B where the maximum is a can be formed by choosing any subset of {1, 2, ..., a-1} and then adding a to it. Because the maximum is a, so all other elements in B must be less than a.

So, the number of such sets for a particular a is 2^{a-1}. Because the number of subsets of {1, 2, ..., a-1} is 2^{a-1}, and each subset corresponds to a set B when you add a.

But wait, that's including the empty set as well. Because the subsets are non-empty? No, wait, B is non-empty, but for each a, the sets B with maximum a must have a, so the subsets of {1, ..., a-1} can include the empty set as well, because adding a gives a non-empty set.

Exactly, so for each a in A, the number of B sets where max(B)=a is 2^{a-1}.

So, if A has elements a_1, a_2, ..., a_n, then the total number of sets B is the sum over each a_i of 2^{a_i -1}.

Given that the total number is 2024, we have:

Sum_{a in A} 2^{a - 1} = 2024.

So, the problem reduces to finding all positive integers a where 2^{a-1} are being summed, such that their total is 2024. Then, sum those a's to get the answer.

So, the key is to find a set A where the sum of 2^{a-1} for each a in A is 2024.

Wait, but how do we find such a set A? Let's think about binary representations.

Wait, 2^{a-1} is a power of two. So, the sum of distinct powers of two would be the binary representation of 2024. But wait, the problem doesn't specify that A must contain unique elements. Or does it?

Wait, A is a set of positive integers, so all elements are unique. So, each a_i is unique, so each 2^{a_i -1} is a distinct power of two, unless a_i's are not unique, but since A is a set, they are unique.

Thus, the sum 2^{a1 -1} + 2^{a2 -1} + ... = 2024, where a1, a2, ... are distinct positive integers.

But 2024 in binary is ... let's convert it.

2024 divided by 2: 2024 /2=1012, remainder 0

1012/2=506, r0

506/2=253, r0

253/2=126, r1

126/2=63, r0

63/2=31, r1

31/2=15, r1

15/2=7, r1

7/2=3, r1

3/2=1, r1

1/2=0, r1

So writing the remainders in reverse order: 11111101000.

Wait, let me count the bits. 2^10 is 1024, 2^11 is 2048. 2024 is less than 2048, so let's see:

2024 - 1024 = 1000

1000 - 512 = 488

488 - 256 = 232

232 - 128 = 104

104 - 64 = 40

40 - 32 = 8

8 - 8 = 0

So
