Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the number of intersections between the graphs of two equations: y = 4 g(f(sin(2πx))) and x = 4 g(f(cos(3πy))). Hmm, that seems a bit complicated, but let's break it down step by step.

First, I need to understand what f(x) and g(x) are. The functions are defined as f(x) = ||x| - 1/2| and g(x) = ||x| - 1/4|. So these are absolute value functions with some transformations. Let me try to visualize these functions.

Starting with f(x). The inner function is |x|, which is a V-shape graph with the vertex at (0,0). Then we subtract 1/2, so that would shift the graph down by 1/2. But since it's inside another absolute value, ||x| - 1/2|, this actually reflects any part of the graph that goes below the x-axis back up. Let's consider the expression inside the absolute value: |x| - 1/2. For |x| >= 1/2, this would be non-negative, so f(x) = |x| - 1/2. For |x| < 1/2, it becomes -( |x| - 1/2 ) = 1/2 - |x|. So f(x) is a V-shaped graph with vertices at x = ±1/2, each at y=0. Between x = -1/2 and x = 1/2, the graph is a V pointing upwards with the vertex at (0,1/2). Outside of that, it's the original |x| shifted down by 1/2.

Similarly, for g(x) = ||x| - 1/4|. Again, the inner function is |x|, subtract 1/4, then take absolute value. So the expression inside is |x| - 1/4. For |x| >= 1/4, this is non-negative, so g(x) = |x| - 1/4. For |x| < 1/4, it becomes -( |x| - 1/4 ) = 1/4 - |x|. So g(x) has vertices at x = ±1/4, each at y=0. Between x = -1/4 and x = 1/4, it's a V pointing upwards with vertex at (0,1/4). Outside, it's the original |x| shifted down by 1/4.

Now, the functions involved in the problem are 4g(f(sin(2πx))) and 4g(f(cos(3πy))). Let me think about what these composite functions look like.

Starting with y = 4 g(f(sin(2πx))). Let's break it down. First, sin(2πx) is a sine wave with period 1, since the coefficient of x is 2π. So sin(2πx) oscillates between -1 and 1, just like the regular sine function, but completes a full cycle every 1 unit along the x-axis.

Then, we apply f to this sine function. So f(sin(2πx)) = || sin(2πx) | - 1/2 |. Let's analyze this. The inner absolute value makes it non-negative, so | sin(2πx) | ranges from 0 to 1. Then subtract 1/2. So for | sin(2πx) | >= 1/2, f(sin(2πx)) = | sin(2πx) | - 1/2. For | sin(2πx) | < 1/2, it becomes 1/2 - | sin(2πx) |. So f(sin(2πx)) will have a V-shape for regions where | sin(2πx) | is less than 1/2 and a linear decrease for where | sin(2πx) | is greater than or equal to 1/2.

Then, we apply g to the result. So g(f(sin(2πx))) = || f(sin(2πx)) | - 1/4 |. Wait, but f(sin(...)) is already an absolute value, so f(sin(2πx)) is non-negative. Therefore, g(f(sin(2πx))) = | f(sin(2πx)) - 1/4 |.

Let me think about the range of f(sin(2πx)). Since | sin(2πx) | is between 0 and 1, f(sin(2πx)) will be:

- For | sin(2πx) | >= 1/2: | sin(2πx) | - 1/2, which ranges from 0 (when | sin | = 1/2) up to 1/2 (when | sin | = 1).
- For | sin(2πx) | < 1/2: 1/2 - | sin(2πx) |, which ranges from 1/2 (when | sin | is 0) down to 0 (when | sin | is 1/2).

So f(sin(2πx)) ranges from 0 to 1/2.

Then, when we subtract 1/4 from this, and take the absolute value, let's see:

g(f(...)) = | (f(...) - 1/4) |.

Since f(...) is between 0 and 1/2, f(...) - 1/4 will be between -1/4 and 1/4. Taking absolute value, this will be between 0 and 1/4. So g(f(...)) ranges from 0 to 1/4.

Multiplying by 4, we have y = 4 * g(f(sin(2πx))) which will be between 0 and 1.

So y ranges between 0 and 1. Similarly, for the other equation, x = 4 g(f(cos(3πy))). Let's analyze that.

First, cos(3πy) is a cosine function with period 2/3, oscillating between -1 and 1. Then, f is applied: f(cos(3πy)) = || cos(3πy) | - 1/2 |, same as before. So f(cos(3πy)) ranges from 0 to 1/2.

Then, g is applied: g(f(...)) = | f(...) - 1/4 |, which ranges from 0 to 1/4. Multiply by 4, so x ranges from 0 to 1.

So both equations have x and y between 0 and 1, but let me think about how to find the number of intersections.

An intersection occurs when there exists (x, y) such that y = 4 g(f(sin(2πx))) and x = 4 g(f(cos(3πy))). So we're looking for points where both equations are satisfied simultaneously.

Given that both x and y are in [0,1], perhaps we can analyze the behavior of these functions over that domain.

Let me consider the functions more carefully.

First, let's analyze the function y = 4 g(f(sin(2πx))). I can try to understand for each x in [0,1], what y is.

Similarly, for x = 4 g(f(cos(3πy))), for each y in [0,1], what x is.

But since the equations are interdependent, it's a system of equations. Solving this analytically might be difficult, so perhaps I can find the number of solutions by considering the periodicity and the number of times these functions cross each other.

Alternatively, perhaps a better approach is to consider that each equation defines a parametric curve, and we need to find how many times these two curves intersect.

But I'm not sure about that. Alternatively, maybe I can parametrize one variable and substitute.

Wait, let's think about substituting. Let me denote u = sin(2πx). Then, the first equation becomes y = 4 g(f(u)). Similarly, for the second equation, let me denote v = cos(3πy), so x = 4 g(f(v)).

But we have:

y = 4 g(f(u)), where u = sin(2πx),

and

x = 4 g(f(v)), where v = cos(3πy).

Hmm, but u and v are functions of x and y, which are linked through the equations. It's getting a bit tangled.

Maybe another approach is to consider the functions as transformations. Let me consider f and g as piecewise functions and try to analyze how they affect the inputs.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to consider the possible values for f(sin(2
