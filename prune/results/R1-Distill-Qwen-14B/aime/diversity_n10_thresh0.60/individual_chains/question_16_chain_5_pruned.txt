Okay, so I've got this problem to solve. Let me read it again to make sure I understand. It says, "Let p be the least prime number for which there exists a positive integer n such that n⁴ + 1 is divisible by p². Find the least positive integer m such that m⁴ + 1 is divisible by p²."

Alright, so the goal is to find the smallest prime p where p² divides n⁴ + 1 for some positive integer n. Once I find that p, I need to find the smallest m where m⁴ + 1 is divisible by p².

Let me start by thinking about primes and their properties. I remember that primes can be categorized based on certain congruence conditions. For example, primes congruent to 1 mod 4 have certain properties related to quadratic residues, while others don't. Maybe something similar applies here with quartic residues.

First, I should check small primes and see if they satisfy the condition. Let's start with p=2. Is there an n such that n⁴ +1 is divisible by 2²=4? Let's see, n can be 1: 1 +1=2, which is not divisible by 4. n=2: 16+1=17, 17 mod 4 is 1, so no. n=3: 81+1=82, 82 mod 4 is 2. No. Hmm, maybe p=2 doesn't work? Or is there a larger n that works?

Wait, let's see. For p=2, n⁴ is either 0 or 1 mod 4. So n⁴ +1 is either 1 or 2 mod 4. So it can never be 0 mod 4, right? So p=2 is out of the question. The next prime is 3.

Testing p=3. Let's see if there's an n where n⁴ +1 is divisible by 9. Let me compute n⁴ mod 9 for n=1 to 8.

n=1: 1 +1=2 mod 9 → 2
n=2: 16 mod 9 is 7, so 7 +1=8 mod 9 → 8
n=3: 81 mod 9 is 0, 0 +1=1
n=4: 256 mod 9. 256 /9 is 28*9=252, 256-252=4. 4 +1=5
n=5: 625 mod 9. 625 - 69*9=625-621=4 → 4 +1=5
n=6: 1296 mod 9 is 0, 0 +1=1
n=7: 7⁴= (7²)²=49²=2401. 2401 mod 9: 2+4+0+1=7, so 7 mod 9. 7 +1=8 mod 9.
n=8: 8⁴=4096. 4+0+9+6=19 →1+9=10→1 mod 9. So 1 +1=2 mod 9.

So none of n=1 to 8 give n⁴ +1 ≡0 mod 9. Hmm, so maybe p=3 isn't the one either. Next prime is 5.

Testing p=5. So p²=25. I need to see if there's an n where n⁴ +1 ≡0 mod25.

Let me compute n⁴ mod25 for n from 1 to 24. Alternatively, maybe I can find some pattern.

I know that in mod 5, n⁴ is 0 or 1, because by Fermat's little theorem, if n isn't divisible by 5, n^4 ≡1 mod5. So n⁴ +1 ≡2 mod5 if n isn't divisible by 5, and 1 mod5 if n is divisible by 5. So in mod5, n⁴ +1 is either 1 or 2. Either way, it's not 0 mod5, which is required for 25 to divide it. So perhaps p=5 is also not possible.

Wait, that's an important point. For n⁴ +1 to be divisible by p², it must also be divisible by p. So n⁴ ≡ -1 mod p. So -1 must be a quartic residue mod p. That gives us a condition on p.

Which primes have -1 as a quartic residue? I think that relates to the order of
