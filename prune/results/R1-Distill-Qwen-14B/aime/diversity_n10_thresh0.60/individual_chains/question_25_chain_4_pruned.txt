Okay, so I have this problem about residents in Aimeville and the things they own. Let me see if I can figure this out step by step. Hmm, the problem gives me the total number of residents, which is 900. Then it tells me how many own each specific item: 195 own a diamond ring, 367 own golf clubs, 562 own a garden spade, and every resident owns a bag of candy hearts. So that's four items in total.

Wait, but each resident owns a bag of candy hearts. So that means the number of people owning candy hearts is 900, right? Because it says each of the 900 owns one. That's an important point. So the four sets we're looking at are diamond rings (let's call that D), golf clubs (G), garden spades (S), and candy hearts (C), which is 900. But since everyone owns C, the set C is the entire population. Hmm, so when we're looking at overlaps, we can think of C as being the universal set for this problem.

The problem also says that 437 residents own exactly two of these things, and 234 own exactly three. And we need to find how many own all four. Okay, so this is a classic inclusion-exclusion problem, but with four sets. I remember that the inclusion-exclusion principle for four sets is a bit more complex, but let me recall the formula.

The formula for four sets is:

|D ∪ G ∪ S ∪ C| = |D| + |G| + |S| + |C| - |D∩G| - |D∩S| - |D∩C| - |G∩S| - |G∩C| - |S∩C| + |D∩G∩S| + |D∩G∩C| + |D∩S∩C| + |G∩S∩C| - |D∩G∩S∩C|

But wait, in this case, since C is the universal set (because everyone owns it), the union of all four sets is equal to the entire population, which is 900. So |D ∪ G ∪ S ∪ C| = 900.

Let me denote |D| = 195, |G|=367, |S|=562, |C|=900.

But wait, I'm not sure if I can use the inclusion-exclusion formula directly because I don't know all the pairwise and triple intersections. The problem gives me the number of people who own exactly two or exactly three items. Maybe I can approach it differently.

I remember that in such problems, the number of people owning exactly k items can be related to the inclusion-exclusion terms. Let's denote:

- Exactly two items: 437
- Exactly three items: 234
- Exactly four items: x (this is what we need to find)
- Exactly one item: y
- None: z

But wait, in our case, since everyone owns at least C, which is a bag of candy hearts, does that mean everyone owns at least one item? Because the problem says each of the 900 owns
