Okay, so I have this probability problem here about Jen entering a lottery. Let me try to break it down step by step. I know I need to find the probability of her winning the grand prize given that she won a prize, and then express that as a fraction m/n where m and n are coprime, and find m + n.

First, let me restate the problem in my own words to make sure I understand it. Jen picks 4 distinct numbers from the set S = {1,2,3,...,10}. Then, 4 numbers are randomly chosen from S. She wins a prize if at least two of her numbers match the randomly chosen ones. She wins the grand prize if all four of her numbers match. I need to find the probability that she won the grand prize given that she won a prize. 

Hmm, so this is a conditional probability problem. The formula for conditional probability is P(A|B) = P(A ∩ B) / P(B), where A is the event that she wins the grand prize and B is the event that she wins a prize.

But wait, if she wins the grand prize, she must have all four numbers matching, which also means she definitely has at least two numbers matching. So A is a subset of B. Therefore, P(A ∩ B) is just P(A). So the formula simplifies to P(A|B) = P(A) / P(B).

So my task is to compute P(A) and P(B), then divide them.

Let me figure out what each of these probabilities is.

First, the total number of ways to choose 4 numbers from 10 is C(10,4), which is the combination of 10 choose 4. I can compute that later, but it's good to note.

P(A) is the probability that all four of her numbers match the randomly chosen four. Since the lottery is choosing 4 numbers, and Jen has 4 specific numbers, there's only one way this can happen: if the lottery picks exactly her four numbers. So the number of favorable outcomes is 1, and the total possible outcomes is C(10,4). So P(A) = 1 / C(10,4).

Now, P(B) is the probability that at least two of her numbers match the randomly chosen four. So, B is the event of getting at least two matches. To find this probability, I can compute the number of ways to choose four numbers such that at least two are among Jen's four, divided by the total number of ways to choose four numbers.

Alternatively, sometimes it's easier to compute the complement probability and subtract from 1. The complement of B is that fewer than two numbers match—i.e., zero or one match. So, P(B) = 1 - P(zero matches) - P(one match).

Let me compute P(zero matches) first. That's the probability that none of Jen's four numbers are chosen. So, the lottery four numbers are all from the remaining 6 numbers (since S has 10, and Jen has 4, so 10 - 4 = 6). The number of ways to choose four numbers from these 6 is C(6,4). So P(zero matches) = C(6,4) / C(10,4).

Similarly, P(one match) is the probability that exactly one of Jen's numbers is chosen, and the other three are from the remaining 6. The number of ways to do this is C(4,1) * C(6,3). So P(one match) = [C(4,1) * C(6,3)] / C(10,4).

Therefore, P(B) = 1 - [C(6,4) + C(4,1)*C(6,3)] / C(10,4).

Let me compute each term step by step.

First, compute C(10,4). That's 10! / (4! * 6!) = (10*9*8*7)/(4*3*2*1) = 210.

C(6,4) is 15, since 6!/(4!2!) = (6*5)/2 = 15.

C(4,1) is 4, and C(6,3) is 20. So C(4,1)*C(6,3) = 4 * 20 = 80.

So, P(zero matches) = 15 / 210 = 1/14.

P(one match) = 80 / 210 = 8/21.

So, P(B) = 1 - (15 + 80)/210 = 1 - 95/210.

Wait, 15 +80 is
