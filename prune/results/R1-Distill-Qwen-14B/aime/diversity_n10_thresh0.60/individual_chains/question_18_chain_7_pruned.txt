Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the number of rectangles that can be formed inside a regular dodecagon. Each side of the rectangle lies on either a side or a diagonal of the dodecagon. Hmm, interesting. I remember that a regular dodecagon has 12 sides, so it's a 12-sided polygon with all sides and angles equal. 

First, I think I should visualize the dodecagon. It's a twelve-sided figure, so it's quite a complex shape. From what I remember, a regular dodecagon can be inscribed in a circle, meaning all its vertices lie on a single circle. That might be useful because the diagonals and sides would correspond to chords of the circle. 

Now, the problem is about rectangles inside this dodecagon. Each side of the rectangle must lie on a side or a diagonal of the dodecagon. So, I guess the rectangles are formed by connecting some of these sides and diagonals. But how exactly? 

I recall that in a regular polygon, the number of sides and the way diagonals connect can create various polygons, including rectangles. For a rectangle to be formed, opposite sides must be equal and parallel, and the angles must be 90 degrees. So, in the context of a regular dodecagon, the sides of the rectangle must be diagonals that are parallel and equal in length.

Wait, but how do diagonals in a regular dodecagon relate to each other? In a regular polygon, two diagonals are parallel if the number of sides they skip is the same. So, for a dodecagon, if I pick a diagonal that skips a certain number of vertices, there will be another diagonal that skips the same number and is parallel to it.

Let me think about the number of sides a rectangle would need. A rectangle has four sides, so in the dodecagon, the sides of the rectangle must be formed by four lines: two pairs of parallel sides. So, perhaps each rectangle is determined by selecting two pairs of parallel diagonals or sides.

But wait, in a regular dodecagon, the sides can also be considered as diagonals that skip zero vertices. So maybe I need to consider both the sides and the diagonals as potential sides of the rectangle.

I wonder if there's a systematic way to count all such rectangles. Maybe by considering the possible pairs of parallel lines and then seeing how they can form rectangles.

Let me think about the possible pairs of parallel sides or diagonals. In a regular dodecagon, each side is part of a system of parallel lines. For example, the sides themselves are all parallel in their respective positions, but in a dodecagon, each side is adjacent to others, so perhaps the sides aren't all parallel. Wait, no, in a regular polygon, sides are all the same length but consecutive sides are not parallel. Instead, sides that are opposite each other are parallel. 

Wait, is that right? For a regular polygon with an even number of sides, like a hexagon (6 sides), the opposite sides are parallel. So in a dodecagon, which has 12 sides, each side has another side parallel to it, six sides apart. So, each side has a corresponding parallel side.

Similarly, diagonals can be parallel. So,
