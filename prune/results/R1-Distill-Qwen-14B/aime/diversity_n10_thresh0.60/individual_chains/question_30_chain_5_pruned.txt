Okay, so I've got this problem here: Let ω not equal to 1 be a 13th root of unity. I need to find the remainder when the product from k=0 to 12 of (2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k}) is divided by 1000. Hmm, okay.

First, I should recall what roots of unity are. A 13th root of unity is a complex number that satisfies ω^13 = 1. There are 13 distinct 13th roots of unity, and they're equally spaced around the unit circle in the complex plane. Since ω ≠ 1, we're looking at the primitive roots, right? So ω is a primitive 13th root of unity, meaning that the smallest positive integer n for which ω^n = 1 is n=13.

The product given is over k from 0 to 12, so that's all the 13th roots of unity. But since ω is a primitive root, ω^k for k=0,1,...,12 are all distinct roots. So the product is over all 13th roots of unity except when ω^k=1, which is when k=0, right? Wait, but the product includes k=0 as well. So when k=0, ω^0 = 1, so the term becomes (2 - 2*1 + 1^0) = 2 - 2 + 1 = 1. So that term is 1, so it doesn't affect the product. Therefore, the product is essentially the product over k=1 to 12 of (2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k}).

But maybe it's easier to include k=0 as it is since it's 1, so the product is just the same.

Now, I need to compute the product from k=0 to 12 of (2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k}). Hmm. So, each term in the product is 2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k}. Let me think about how to simplify this expression.

Maybe I can factor or rewrite this expression. Let's see: 2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k} can be rewritten as ω^{2k} - 2ω^k + 2. Or perhaps factor it as a quadratic in ω^k.

Let me try that. Let’s let x = ω^k. Then the expression becomes x² - 2x + 2. So, the term is x² - 2x + 2. So, the product becomes the product from k=0 to 12 of (x² - 2x + 2), where x = ω^k.

But each term is a quadratic in x, where x is a 13th root of unity. So, perhaps this relates to polynomials whose roots are the 13th roots of unity.

Wait, the minimal polynomial for ω is the 13th cyclotomic polynomial, which is Φ_13(x) = x^12 + x^11 + ... + x + 1. Because Φ_n(x) is the product of (x - ω^k) for k from 1 to 12, where ω is a primitive nth root of unity.

But in our case, each term is x² - 2x + 2. So, perhaps the entire product can be related to evaluating a certain polynomial at specific points.

Wait, since the product is over all x = ω^k, for k=0 to 12, but x=1 is included when k=0. So, the product is the product over all x of (x² - 2x + 2), where x is a 13th root of unity.

But wait, the product over all (x² - 2x +
