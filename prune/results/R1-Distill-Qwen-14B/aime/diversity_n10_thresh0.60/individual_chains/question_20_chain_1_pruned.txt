Okay, so I have this problem about placing chips on a 5x5 grid. There are 25 white chips and 25 black chips, but I can only place some of them. The conditions are a bit tricky, so I need to break them down.

First, let me restate the problem to make sure I understand. I have a 5x5 grid, which means 25 cells. Each cell can have at most one chip, so I can't have two chips in the same cell. Then, all chips in the same row must be the same color, and all chips in the same column must also be the same color. Additionally, any additional chip I try to place would violate one or both of the previous two conditions. So, the arrangement must be maximal with respect to those constraints.

Wait, so that means the configuration I come up with must be such that I can't add any more chips without breaking the row or column color rules. Interesting.

Let me think about how the chips can be placed. Since each row must have all chips of the same color, each row can either be all white, all black, or have no chips. Similarly, each column must have all chips of the same color, so each column can be all white, all black, or empty.

But wait, if a row is all white, then every cell in that row has a white chip. Similarly for black. But the column constraints complicate things because if a column is all white, then every cell in that column must also have white chips.

Hmm, perhaps I should model this as each row and column being either white, black, or empty, but with the constraints that if a row is non-empty, then all its cells are that color, and the same for columns.

But wait, that seems conflicting because if a row is white, then all its columns must also be white if those columns have a chip in that row? No, not exactly. Because a column can have some cells empty, but if any cell in a column is filled, then all chips in that column must be the same color.

Wait, let me clarify the problem statement:

All chips in the same row have the same color. Similarly, all chips in the same column have the same color.

So, for a given row, if there's at least one chip, all chips in that row are the same color. Similarly for a column.

So, for a row, it's either:

- All white (if any cell is white),

- All black (if any cell is black),

- Or empty.

Wait, no. Because if a row has both white and black chips, that's not allowed. So, each row must be either all white, all black, or empty. Similarly, each column must be all white, all black, or empty.

But how do these constraints interact? Because if a row is all white, then every column that intersects that row must have their first cell (in that row) as white. But if a column is all black, then any cell in that column must be black. So, if a row is all white and a column is all black, their intersection (the cell) can't have a chip because it can't be both white and black. Therefore, if a row is all white and a column is all black, the cell at their intersection must be empty.
