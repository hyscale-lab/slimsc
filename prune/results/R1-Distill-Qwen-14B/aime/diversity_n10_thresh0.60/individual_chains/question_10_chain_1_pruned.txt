Okay, so I have this problem here where Alice chooses a set A of positive integers. Then Bob lists all finite nonempty sets B of positive integers such that the maximum element of B is in A. It says Bob's list has 2024 sets, and I need to find the sum of the elements of A. Hmm, let me try to break this down.

First, let me make sure I understand the problem correctly. Alice picks some set A. Then Bob considers all finite, non-empty sets B where each B has a maximum element that's in A. The total number of such sets B is 2024. I need to figure out what A is, specifically the sum of its elements.

So, maybe I should consider what the possible sets B can be. Since each B is a finite non-empty set, and the maximum is in A, then for each element a in A, how many sets B can have a as their maximum?

Wait, that makes sense. For each a in A, the number of sets B where a is the maximum is equal to the number of subsets of {1, 2, ..., a-1}, because once you choose any subset (including the empty set) of the numbers less than a, and then add a to it, you get a set where the maximum is a.

But wait, B has to be non-empty. So, if a is the maximum, then the subsets we can choose from {1,2,...,a-1} must be non-empty when combined with a. Wait, no, actually, the subsets can be empty because adding a to the empty set gives {a}, which
