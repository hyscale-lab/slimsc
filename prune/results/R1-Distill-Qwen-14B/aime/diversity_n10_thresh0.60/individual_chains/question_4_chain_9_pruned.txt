Okay, so Alice and Bob are playing this game with a stack of n tokens. They take turns, starting with Alice. On each turn, a player can remove either 1 or 4 tokens. The person who takes the last token wins. I need to find how many positive integers n â‰¤ 2024 allow Bob to have a winning strategy, no matter how Alice plays.

Hmm, okay, so this is a combinatorial game theory problem. I remember that in such games, positions can be classified as either winning or losing positions. A winning position means the current player can force a win, while a losing position means no matter what the current player does, the opponent can force a win.

So, in this case, we need to find all n where Bob can force a win, regardless of Alice's moves. Since Bob is the second player, that would mean n is a losing position for Alice, who goes first. So Bob's winning positions would be the losing positions for Alice.

Let me think about how to model this. Let's define the positions as either "winning" or "losing". Let's say a position is losing if the player whose turn it is cannot force a win, assuming the opponent plays optimally.

So for each n, we can determine if it's a winning or losing position.

Let's start by computing the positions for small n and see if we can find a pattern.

n=1: Alice can take 1 token and win. So n=1 is a winning position for Alice, meaning Bob can't win here. So n=1 is not in the set we are counting.

n=2: Alice can take 1 token, leaving 1 for Bob. Then Bob can take that 1 and win. Wait, no, because if Alice takes 1, she leaves n=1. Then Bob takes 1 and wins. So Alice would not want to do that. Alternatively, can Alice take 4 tokens? No, because n=2, so she can't take 4. So Alice must take 1, leaving n=1, which is a winning position for Bob. Wait, so n=2: Alice can't force a win, so Bob can win. So n=2 is a losing position for Alice, meaning Bob can win here. So n=2 is counted.

Wait, let me make sure. For n=2:

- Alice can only take
