Okay, so I've got this math problem here, and I'm supposed to find the number of intersections between two graphs. The equations given are y = 4g(f(sin(2πx))) and x = 4g(f(cos(3πy))). Hmm, that sounds a bit complicated, but I'll try to break it down.

First, I need to understand what functions f and g are. The problem defines f(x) as ||x| - 1/2|, and g(x) as ||x| - 1/4|. Wait, I should parse that correctly. So f(x) is the absolute value of (absolute value of x minus 1/2), right? Similarly for g(x). So both f and g are functions that take the absolute value of their input, subtract a fraction, and then take the absolute value again. That probably means both f and g are piecewise linear functions with corners where the inner absolute value expressions change their behavior.

Let me sketch what f(x) looks like. For f(x) = ||x| - 1/2|, the inner part |x| - 1/2 will be V-shaped with a vertex at x=0, but shifted down by 1/2. So when |x| is greater than or equal to 1/2, |x| - 1/2 is non-negative, and the outer absolute value doesn't change it. When |x| is less than 1/2, |x| - 1/2 is negative, and the outer absolute value flips it, so f(x) = 1/2 - |x|.

So f(x) has a V shape that's actually two Vs. For x between -1/2 and 1/2, f(x) is 1/2 - |x|, which is a downward-opening V peaking at (0, 1/2). For |x| >= 1/2, f(x) is |x| - 1/2, which is an upward-opening V starting at (1/2, 0) and (-1/2, 0). So it's like a W shape but flattened in the middle.

Similarly, let's look at g(x) = ||x| - 1/4|. The same logic applies. The inner part is |x| - 1/4. So when |x| >= 1/4, g(x) = |x| - 1/4, and when |x| < 1/4, g(x) = 1/4 - |x|. So g(x) has a similar structure but with a peak at (0, 1/4) and the Vs starting at x = ±1/4.

Now, the functions inside the equations are f(sin(2πx)) and g(f(...)). Let me think. The first equation is y = 4g(f(sin(2πx))). So, let's break it down step by step.

Start with sin(2πx). The sine function oscillates between -1 and 1, so sin(2πx) is a sine wave with period 1, because the argument is 2πx instead of πx. So x goes from 0 to 1, and the sine completes a full cycle. So the function sin(2πx) has a period of 1.

Then, f is applied to sin(2πx). So f(sin(2πx)) is ||sin(2πx)| - 1/2|. Let's see what that does. Because sin(2πx) is between -1 and 1, |sin(2πx)| is between 0 and 1. So |sin(2πx)| - 1/2 will be between -1/2 and 1/2. Taking the absolute value of that, ||sin(2πx)| - 1/2|, will give a function that is V-shaped but folded at certain points.

Wait, let's think more carefully. Let me denote t = sin(2πx). Then f(t) = ||t| - 1/2|.

Since t is between -1 and 1, |t| is between 0 and 1. So |t| - 1/2 is between -1/2 and 1/2. Therefore, ||t| - 1/2| is the absolute value of that, which would make it between 0 and 1/2.

But, more precisely, when |t| >= 1/2, f(t) = |t| - 1/2, which is non-negative, so no change. When |t| < 1/2, f(t) = 1/2 - |t|, which is positive. So f(t) is a function that for |t| >= 1/2, it's |t| - 1/2, and for |t| < 1/2, it's 1/2 - |t|. So f(t) is a V shape with a peak at t=0 (value 1/2), and it goes down to 0 at t=±1/2, then up again to t=±1, where it's 1 - 1/2 = 1/2.

Wait, no. Wait, if t is between -1 and 1, and |t| is the absolute value. So, when |t| is in [0, 1/2), f(t) = 1/2 - |t|, which is a downward slope from (0, 1/2) to (1/2, 0). When |t| is in [1/2, 1], f(t) = |t| -1/2, which is an upward slope from (1/2, 0) to (1, 1/2). So f(t) is a triangle wave that goes from 0 at t=±1/2, up to 1/2 at t=±1, and down to 1/2 at t=0. So it's a V shape with peaks at 0 and ±1, and valleys at ±1/2.

Then, g(f(t)) is the next step. Since f(t) is between 0 and 1/2, because when t is between -1 and 1, f(t) is in [0, 1/2]. So f(t) is in [0, 1/2], so let's compute g(f(t)).

g(x) is ||x| - 1/4|. Since x is in [0, 1/2], |x| is x. So g(x) = |x - 1/4|. So for x in [0, 1/4], g(x) = 1/4 - x. For x in [1/4, 1/2], g(x) = x - 1/4.

So g(f(t)) will be 1/4 - f(t) when f(t) <= 1/4, and f(t) - 1/4 when f(t) >= 1/4.

But f(t)
