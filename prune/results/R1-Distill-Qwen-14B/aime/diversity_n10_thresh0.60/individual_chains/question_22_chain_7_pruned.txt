Okay, so I've got this problem about a convex equilateral hexagon. Let me try to visualize it. It's ABCDEF, so six sides. All sides are equal, which is what equilateral means, right? And it's convex, so none of the internal angles point outwards. Also, all pairs of opposite sides are parallel. Hmm, that's interesting.

So, the problem says that if you extend the sides AB, CD, and EF, they form a triangle with side lengths 200, 240, and 300. I need to find the side length of the hexagon.

First, let's think about the hexagon. Since it's convex and equilateral with opposite sides parallel, it's probably similar to a regular hexagon but not necessarily with all angles equal. Wait, no, a regular hexagon is both equilateral and equiangular, but here it's just equilateral, so the angles might not all be 120 degrees. But the fact that opposite sides are parallel is key here.

So, in a regular hexagon, each side is parallel to the side three steps ahead. So, AB is parallel to DE, BC is parallel to EF, and CD is parallel to FA. But in this problem, it's stated as all pairs of opposite sides are parallel. So, AB || DE, BC || EF, CD || FA. That makes sense.

Now, the triangle formed by extending AB, CD, and EF. Let's denote that triangle as triangle T. The sides of T are 200, 240, and 300. I think I need to figure out how the hexagon relates to this triangle.

Let me try to sketch this in my mind. The hexagon is inside the triangle, and each of the sides AB, CD, EF are being extended to form the triangle. So, each of those sides is a segment inside the triangle, and when extended, they meet to form the triangle's vertices.

Since the hexagon is convex and equilateral, each of these extended sides must intersect at the triangle's vertices. Maybe the triangle is surrounding the hexagon, and the hexagon is inscribed in a way.

I remember that in such cases, similar triangles might come into play because the sides are being extended. So, maybe the triangle T is similar to smaller triangles formed near each vertex of the hexagon.

Wait, let me think about the properties of such a hexagon. Since opposite sides are parallel, the hexagon can be thought of as a translation or a combination of parallelograms. Or maybe it's a zonogon, which is a convex polygon with opposite sides equal and parallel.

In a regular hexagon, it's a zonogon, but this one is not necessarily regular. However, all sides are equal, so each pair of opposite sides must not only be parallel but also equal in length. Wait, but in a regular hexagon, opposite sides are equal. But even in a non-regular equilateral hexagon with opposite sides parallel, the lengths of the sides are equal, so in this case, each side is of length 's', which is the side length we need to find.

So, the hexagon is a convex equilateral zonogon with opposite sides parallel. That might help in using properties of zonogons,
