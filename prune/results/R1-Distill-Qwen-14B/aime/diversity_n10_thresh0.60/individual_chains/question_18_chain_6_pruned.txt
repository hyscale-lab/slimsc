Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the number of rectangles that can be formed inside a regular dodecagon. Each side of the rectangle has to lie on either a side or a diagonal of the dodecagon. Hmm, okay, let me try to visualize this.

First, a regular dodecagon has 12 sides, all equal in length, and all internal angles are equal too. Each internal angle is 150 degrees, I think. But maybe that's not directly important here.

The problem mentions that the sides of the rectangles lie on either sides or diagonals of the dodecagon. So, the rectangles are formed by connecting vertices of the dodecagon, right? Because sides and diagonals are line segments connecting two vertices.

Wait, no, actually, sides are edges between adjacent vertices, and diagonals are edges connecting non-adjacent vertices. So, the sides and diagonals are all the possible line segments between the 12 vertices.

So, if I'm looking for rectangles, I need to find four points (vertices) in the dodecagon such that the lines connecting them form a rectangle. That means, for four points A, B, C, D, the sides AB, BC, CD, DA should lie on the sides or diagonals of the dodecagon, and the angles should be 90 degrees.

But wait, in a regular polygon, when can four vertices form a rectangle? I think it has to do with the symmetry of the polygon. Rectangles require that opposite sides are equal and all angles are right angles.

In a regular dodecagon, the vertices are equally spaced around a circle. So, the key is to find four points that are spaced such that their connecting lines are either sides or diagonals and that the angles are right angles.

Hmm, I remember that in regular polygons, rectangles can be formed when the vertices are symmetrically placed. For example, in a square (which is a regular quadrilateral), you can form a rectangle by connecting every other vertex. But since a dodecagon has 12 sides, maybe the vertices of the rectangle are spaced in certain intervals.

Let me think about how to approach this. Maybe I can parameterize the positions of the vertices. Since it's a regular dodecagon, I can number the vertices from 0 to 11. Each vertex can be represented as a point on the unit circle at angles of 30 degrees apart (
