Okay, so I'm trying to solve this geometry problem. Let me read it again to make sure I get all the details.

We have points O at (0,0), A at (1/2, 0), and B at (0, sqrt(3)/2). There's a family of segments PQ called F, each of length 1, lying in the first quadrant. P is on the x-axis, and Q is on the y-axis. So each segment PQ starts somewhere on the x-axis and ends somewhere on the y-axis, and the distance between P and Q is 1 unit.

The problem says there's a unique point C on segment AB, other than A and B, that doesn't belong to any segment from F other than AB itself. Then we need to find OC squared, which is the square of the distance from the origin to point C, and express it as a fraction p/q where p and q are coprime. Finally, we have to find p + q.

Alright, let me unpack this. So AB is a line segment from A(1/2, 0) to B(0, sqrt(3)/2). I can find the equation of line AB. Then, we're looking for a point C on AB such that C is not on any other segment from F except AB. So, C is only on AB and not on any other PQ from F.

First, let me figure out the equation of line AB. Points A and B are given, so the slope would be (sqrt(3)/2 - 0)/(0 - 1/2) = (sqrt(3)/2) / (-1/2) = -sqrt(3). So the slope of AB is -sqrt(3). Then, using point-slope form, using point A: y - 0 = -sqrt(3)(x - 1/2). So the equation is y = -sqrt(3) x + sqrt(3)/2.

So any point C on AB can be parametrized. Let's say point C is (x, y) where y = -sqrt(3) x + sqrt(3)/2.

Now, the family F consists of segments PQ with P on x-axis, Q on y-axis, PQ = 1. So for any such segment, P is (p, 0) and Q is (0, q) where sqrt(p^2 + q^2) = 1. Wait, no. Wait, the distance between P and Q is 1. Since P is (p, 0) and Q is (0, q), the distance between them is sqrt((p)^2 + (q)^2) = 1. So p^2 + q^2 =1.

But since we're in the first quadrant, p and q are positive. So all such PQ segments are from (p, 0) to (0, q) with p^2 + q^2 =1.

So, any PQ is a line segment from (p,0) to (0,q) where p^2 + q^2 =1.

Now, each such PQ is a line segment. The problem says that C is a point on AB that doesn't lie on any other PQ except AB itself. So C is on AB, but not on any other segment in F.

So, our task is to find such a point C on AB, and then compute OC^2.

Wait, but maybe AB is one of these PQ segments? Let's check.

Point A is (1/2, 0), and point B is (0, sqrt(3)/2). Let's compute the distance between A and B. Distance AB is sqrt( (1/2)^2 + (sqrt(3)/2)^2 ) = sqrt(1/4 + 3/4) = sqrt(1) = 1. Oh, so AB is a segment of length 1, so AB is in F. So AB is one of these PQ segments, with P = A and Q = B.

So, C is on AB, but not on any other PQ in F. So, we need to find a point on AB that is not on any other F segment except AB.

Hmm. So, perhaps the point C is such that it's the only intersection point of AB with all these PQ segments. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe C is the point where AB is tangent to the envelope of all these PQ segments.

Wait, I remember that an envelope of a family of curves is a curve that is tangent to each member of the family at some point. So perhaps AB is tangent to the envelope of all these PQ segments, and the point of tangency is C.

So, if I can find the envelope of the family F
