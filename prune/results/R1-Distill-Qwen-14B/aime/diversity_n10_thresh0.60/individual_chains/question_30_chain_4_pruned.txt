Okay, so I have this problem here: Let ω ≠ 1 be a 13th root of unity. I need to find the remainder when the product from k=0 to 12 of (2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k}) is divided by 1000. Hmm, okay, let's break this down.

First, I know that ω is a primitive 13th root of unity, meaning ω^13 = 1, and ω^k ≠ 1 for any k from 1 to 12. So, the minimal polynomial for ω would be the 13th cyclotomic polynomial, right? Which is Φ₁₃(x) = x¹² + x¹¹ + ... + x + 1. That might come in handy later.

Now, the product given is Π_{k=0}^{12} (2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k}). Hmm. Since k goes from 0 to 12, that's all the 13th roots of unity. So, maybe there's a way to relate this product to some cyclotomic polynomial or another known polynomial.

Let me try to understand each term in the product. Each term is 2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k}. Let me factor that expression or see if it resembles a known form.

Wait, 2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k} can be rewritten. Let me see: 2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k} = ω^{2k} - 2ω^k + 2. Hmm, that looks like a quadratic in ω^k. Let me set x = ω^k, so the term becomes x² - 2x + 2.

So, each term is x² - 2x + 2, where x is ω^k. So the product becomes Π_{k=0}^{12} (x² - 2x + 2) evaluated at x = ω^k.

Wait a second, but the product is over all x = ω^k, which are all the 13th roots of unity. So, is there a way to express this product in terms of a
