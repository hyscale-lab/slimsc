Okay, so I have this problem about a regular octagon where each vertex is colored either red or blue, each with equal probability. The question is asking for the probability that we can rotate the octagon such that all the blue vertices end up where there were originally red vertices. The answer needs to be in the form of m/n where m and n are coprime, and then we have to find m + n.

Hmm, let me break this down. First, the octagon has 8 vertices, each colored red or blue independently with a 50-50 chance. So the total number of possible colorings is 2^8 = 256. That's the denominator for our probability.

Now, the numerator is the number of colorings where there's a rotation that maps blue vertices to red positions. So we need to count all such colorings.

Wait, I'm not sure I understand the problem correctly. Let me read it again: "the octagon can then be rotated so that all of the blue vertices end up at positions where there were originally red vertices." So, after rotation, every blue vertex is now on a spot that was red before the rotation. That means that the set of blue vertices must be a rotation of the set of red vertices, right?

So, in other words, the blue vertices form a rotation of the red vertices. But since the octagon is regular, any rotation is just shifting by some number of steps. So maybe the number of blue vertices must equal the number of red vertices, because rotating won't change the count.

Wait, that's true. So for such a rotation to exist, the number of blue vertices must be equal to the number of red vertices, which is 4 each. So does that mean that the only colorings that satisfy the condition are those with exactly 4 blue and 4 red vertices? Or is that not necessarily the case?

Wait, no, maybe not necessarily. Because even if you have different numbers, but perhaps the blue vertices can still be rotated into red positions. Wait, no, because if you rotate, the number of blue vertices should remain the same. So if you have, say, 3 blue and 5 red, you can't rotate and have all blue vertices moved to red positions because there are only 3. So the number of blue and red must be the same.

So the number of blue vertices must equal the number of red vertices. Therefore, the only colorings that satisfy the condition must have exactly 4 blue and 4
