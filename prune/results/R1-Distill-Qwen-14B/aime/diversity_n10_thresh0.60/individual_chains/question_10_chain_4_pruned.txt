Okay, so I've got this math problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's read it again.

Alice chooses a set A of positive integers. Then Bob lists all finite nonempty sets B of positive integers with the property that the maximum element of B belongs to A. Bob's list has 2024 sets. Find the sum of the elements of A.

Hmm. Let me try to parse this.

Alice picks a set A. Then Bob considers all possible finite nonempty sets B where the maximum element of B is in A. The number of such sets B is 2024. I need to find the sum of the elements in A.

Wait, so Bob's list has 2024 sets. Each set B is finite, nonempty, and the maximum element of B is in A. So A is some set, and for each element a in A, Bob can form sets B where a is the maximum. So the number of such sets is based on how many elements are in A and how big those elements are.

Let me think. Suppose A has elements a1, a2, ..., an, where a1 < a2 < ... < an. Because it's a set, order doesn't matter, but for counting, maybe the order doesn't matter either. Wait, no, because the maximum depends on the elements.

For each element a in A, how many sets B have maximum a? Well, since B is finite and nonempty, and the maximum is a, the other elements of B must be less than a. But they can be any positive integers less than a.

Wait,
