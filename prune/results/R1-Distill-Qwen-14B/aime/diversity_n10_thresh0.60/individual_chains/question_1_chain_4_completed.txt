Okay, so I have this problem with logarithms and three variables x, y, z. The equations given are all logarithms base 2, which is good because it might make things a bit simpler. The goal is to find |log₂(x⁴y³z²)| and express it as a fraction m/n where m and n are coprime, then find m + n. 

Let me write down the equations first to get a clear picture.

1. log₂(x / (y z)) = 1/2
2. log₂(y / (x z)) = 1/3
3. log₂(z / (x y)) = 1/4

Hmm. So each equation is a logarithm of a ratio of one variable over the product of the other two. Since all the logs are base 2, maybe I can convert these into exponential form to make them easier to handle.

Starting with the first equation: log₂(x / (y z)) = 1/2. Converting that, it becomes x / (y z) = 2^(1/2), which is sqrt(2). So x = y z * sqrt(2). Let me write that down:

x = y z * 2^(1/2)  ...(1)

Similarly, the second equation: log₂(y / (x z)) = 1/3. Converting, y / (x z) = 2^(1/3). So y = x z * 2^(1/3). Let me note that:

y = x z * 2^(1/3)  ...(2)

Third equation: log₂(z / (x y)) = 1/4. So z / (x y) = 2^(1/4), which implies z = x y * 2^(1/4). So:

z = x y * 2^(1/4)  ...(3)

Now I have three equations, each expressing one variable in terms of the other two and a power of 2. Maybe I can substitute these equations into each other to find expressions for x, y, z in terms that can be solved.

Let me see. From equation (1), x is expressed in terms of y and z. From equation (2), y is expressed in terms of x and z. But since equation (1) has x in terms of y and z, perhaps I can substitute equation (2) into equation (1) to express x in terms of z and then substitute into equation (3), or something like that.

Wait, maybe it's better to express all variables in terms of one variable. Let me try expressing y and z in terms of x, then substitute back.

Wait, actually, maybe another approach. Let me take all three equations and express the ratios. Let me see:

From equation (1): x / (y z) = 2^(1/2)  ...(1a)

From equation (2): y / (x z) = 2^(1/3)  ...(2a)

From equation (3): z / (x y) = 2^(1/4)  ...(3a)

If I multiply all three equations together, I get:

(x / (y z)) * (y / (x z)) * (z / (x y)) = 2^(1/2) * 2^(1/3) * 2^(1/4)

Simplify the left side:

The numerator is x * y * z. The denominator is y z * x z * x y.

Wait, let me compute step by step.

First, each fraction:

First term: x/(y z)
Second term: y/(x z)
Third term: z/(x y)

Multiply them:

(x/(y z)) * (y/(x z)) * (z/(x y)) ) = (x * y * z) / (y z * x z * x y)

Simplify numerator and denominator:

Numerator: x y z

Denominator: y z * x z * x y = (y z)(x z)(x y) = x^2 y^2 z^2

Wait, no. Let me compute the denominator step by step:

(y z) * (x z) * (x y) = y z * x z * x y

Group the terms:

= (y * x * x) * (z * z) * y
Wait, no. Let me think in terms of exponents.

Each variable in the denominator:

x appears in two terms: x z and x y, so x^2

y appears in two terms: y z and x y, so y^2

z appears in two terms: y z and x z, so z^2

Wait, no. Let me see:

The denominator is (y z) * (x z) * (x y) 

= y * z * x * z * x * y

= x^2 y^2 z^2

So numerator is x y z, denominator is x² y² z². So the entire product is (x y z) / (x² y² z²) = 1/(x y z). 

So left side is 1/(x y z).

Right side: 2^(1/2 + 1/3 + 1/4). Let me compute the exponent:

1/2 + 1/3 + 1/4. Common denominator is 12.

1/2 = 6/12

1/3 = 4/12

1/4 = 3/12

So sum is 6 + 4 + 3 = 13 over 12, so 13/12.

Therefore, 2^(13/12).

Putting it together:

1/(x y z) = 2^(13/12)

Which implies that x y z = 2^(-13/12)

Hmm, that's a useful equation. Let me denote that as equation (4):

x y z = 2^(-13/12)  ...(4)

So the product of x, y, z is 2^(-13/12). Cool.

Now, I have equations (1a), (2a), (3a), and equation (4). I need to find x, y, z individually, but perhaps I can find expressions for x, y, z in terms of each other and then use equation (4) to solve for them.

Let me go back to equation (1a): x = 2^(1/2) y z

Similarly, equation (2a): y = 2^(1/3) x z

Equation (3a): z = 2^(1/4) x y

So, if I can express x, y, z in terms of each other, perhaps I can find ratios or something.

Let me try substituting equation (2a) into equation (1a). So from equation (2a), y = 2^(1/3) x z. Plugging this into equation (1a):

x = 2^(1/2) * (2^(1/3) x z) * z )

Simplify:

x = 2^(1/2) * 2^(1/3) * x * z^2

So x = 2^(1/2 + 1/3) * x * z^2

Compute the exponent: 1/2 + 1/3 = 3/6 + 2/6 = 5/6.

So x = 2^(5/6) x z^2

Divide both sides by x (since x is positive, can do that):

1 = 2^(5/6) z^2

So z^2 = 2^(-5/6)

Therefore, z = 2^(-5/12)  [since z is positive, take positive root]

So z is 2^(-5/12). Cool, that's one variable found.

Now, let me see if I can find y. Let me use equation (2a): y = 2^(1/3) x z.

I can write y in terms of x and z, but I need to find x or another relation.

Wait, equation (4) says x y z = 2^(-13/12). We can use that.

But we have z = 2^(-5/12), so plug that into equation (4):

x y * 2^(-5/12) = 2^(-13/12)

So x y = 2^(-13/12) / 2^(-5/12) = 2^(-13/12 + 5/12) = 2^(-8/12) = 2^(-2/3)

So x y = 2^(-2/3)  ...(5)

Similarly, from equation (1a): x = 2^(1/2) y z 

We know z, so:

x = 2^(1/2) y * 2^(-5/12) = 2^(1/2 -5/12) y

Compute the exponent: 1/2 is 6/12, so 6/12 -5/12 = 1/12.

So x = 2^(1/12) y

So from equation (5): x y = 2^(-2/3)

But x = 2^(1/12) y, so substitute:

2^(1/12) y * y = 2^(-2/3)

Which is 2^(1/12) y² = 2^(-2/3)

Solve for y²:

y² = 2^(-2/3) / 2^(1/12) = 2^(-2/3 -1/12) 

Compute exponent: -2/3 is -8/12, so -8/12 -1/12 = -9/12 = -3/4.

So y² = 2^(-3/4)

Therefore, y = 2^(-3/8)  [positive root]

So y is 2^(-3/8)

Now, knowing y, let's find x from equation (5): x y = 2^(-2/3)

x = 2^(-2/3) / y = 2^(-2/3) / 2^(-3/8) = 2^(-2/3 + 3/8)

Compute exponent: -2/3 is -16/24, 3/8 is 9/24. So -16/24 +9/24 = -7/24.

So x = 2^(-7/24)

So x is 2^(-7/24), y is 2^(-3/8), z is 2^(-5/12)

Let me verify if these values satisfy equation (3a): z = 2^(1/4) x y

Compute 2^(1/4) x y: 2^(1/4) * 2^(-7/24) * 2^(-3/8)

Compute exponents:

1/4 = 6/24

-7/24

-3/8 = -9/24

So 6/24 -7/24 -9/24 = (6 -7 -9)/24 = (-10)/24 = -5/12

So 2^(-5/12) which is equal to z. Perfect, that works.

So now, we have x, y, z in terms of exponents of 2.

x = 2^(-7/24), y = 2^(-3/8), z = 2^(-5/12)

Now, the problem asks for |log₂(x⁴y³z²)|. So let's compute that.

First, compute x⁴ y³ z²:

x⁴ = (2^(-7/24))^4 = 2^(-7/24 *4) = 2^(-7/6)

y³ = (2^(-3/8))^3 = 2^(-9/8)

z² = (2^(-5/12))^2 = 2^(-5/6)

So, x⁴ y³ z² = 2^(-7/6) * 2^(-9/8) * 2^(-5/6)

Multiply exponents:

Add the exponents:

-7/6 -9/8 -5/6

First, find a common denominator. 6, 8, 6. The least common denominator is 24.

Convert each fraction:

-7/6 = -28/24

-9/8 = -27/24

-5/6 = -20/24

Adding them: -28 -27 -20 = -75. So -75/24.

Simplify: -75/24 = -25/8.

So x⁴ y³ z² = 2^(-25/8)

Then, log₂(x⁴ y³ z²) = log₂(2^(-25/8)) = -25/8

Since we take absolute value, | -25/8 | = 25/8

So the value is 25/8, which is already in lowest terms because 25 and 8 are coprime (factors of 25 are 1,5,25; factors of 8 are 1,2,4,8; only common factor is 1).

Therefore, m =25, n=8, so m +n= 33.

**Final Answer**
The value of \(m + n\) is \boxed{33}.


Given the system of equations involving logarithms:

1. \(\log_2\left(\frac{x}{yz}\right) = \frac{1}{2}\)
2. \(\log_2\left(\frac{y}{xz}\right) = \frac{1}{3}\)
3. \(\log_2\left(\frac{z}{xy}\right) = \frac{1}{4}\)

We convert these logarithmic equations into their exponential forms:

1. \(\frac{x}{yz} = 2^{1/2}\)
2. \(\frac{y}{xz} = 2^{1/3}\)
3. \(\frac{z}{xy} = 2^{1/4}\)

Multiplying these three equations together, we get:

\[
\left(\frac{x}{yz}\right) \left(\frac{y}{xz}\right) \left(\frac{z}{xy}\right) = 2^{1/2} \cdot 2^{1/3} \cdot 2^{1/4}
\]

Simplifying the left side, we have:

\[
\frac{x \cdot y \cdot z}{(yz) \cdot (xz) \cdot (xy)} = \frac{1}{x y z}
\]

The right side simplifies to:

\[
2^{1/2 + 1/3 + 1/4} = 2^{13/12}
\]

Thus, we find:

\[
\frac{1}{x y z} = 2^{13/12} \implies x y z = 2^{-13/12}
\]

Next, we express each variable in terms of the others and solve for \(x\), \(y\), and \(z\):

1. From \(\frac{x}{yz} = 2^{1/2}\), we get \(x = 2^{1/2} yz\).
2. From \(\frac{y}{xz} = 2^{1/3}\), we get \(y = 2^{1/3} xz\).
3. From \(\frac{z}{xy} = 2^{1/4}\), we get \(z = 2^{1/4} xy\).

Substituting these into each other, we find:

- \(z = 2^{-5/12}\)
- \(y = 2^{-3/8}\)
- \(x = 2^{-7/24}\)

We then compute \(x^4 y^3 z^2\):

\[
x^4 = (2^{-7/24})^4 = 2^{-7/6}, \quad y^3 = (2^{-3/8})^3 = 2^{-9/8}, \quad z^2 = (2^{-5/12})^2 = 2^{-5/6}
\]

Multiplying these together:

\[
x^4 y^3 z^2 = 2^{-7/6} \cdot 2^{-9/8} \cdot 2^{-5/6} = 2^{-25/8}
\]

Taking the logarithm base 2:

\[
\log_2(x^4 y^3 z^2) = \log_2(2^{-25/8}) = -\frac{25}{8}
\]

Taking the absolute value:

\[
\left| \log_2(x^4 y^3 z^2) \right| = \frac{25}{8}
\]

Thus, \(m = 25\) and \(n = 8\), leading to \(m + n = 33\).

\[
\boxed{33}
\]
