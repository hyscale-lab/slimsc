Okay, so I've got this problem here about coloring the vertices of a regular octagon either red or blue. Each vertex is colored independently with equal probability, so that's a 50-50 chance for each color. The question is about the probability that we can rotate the octagon such that all the blue vertices end up where the red ones were originally. They mention the probability is m/n where m and n are coprime, and we need to find m + n. 

First, I need to understand the problem clearly. We're dealing with a regular octagon, which has eight sides, so eight vertices. Each vertex is colored either red or blue, each color equally likely. So for each vertex, the probability it's red is 1/2, same for blue. 

Now, the key part is that after coloring, we want to rotate the octagon in such a way that every blue vertex moves to a position where there was originally a red vertex. So, essentially, after rotation, all blue vertices must align with the red ones from the starting configuration. 

Let me think about what that means. If we can find a rotation that maps all blue vertices to positions that were previously red, then the set of blue vertices is a subset of the red vertices under some rotation. Or perhaps more accurately, the set of blue vertices must be a rotation of the set of red vertices. 

Wait, no. Actually, the problem is the opposite: the blue vertices must, after rotation, occupy the positions that were originally red. So, the set of blue vertices must be a rotation of the set of red vertices. So, maybe the set of blue vertices is a rotation of the set of red vertices. 

Alternatively, we can think of it as the set of blue vertices is equal to the set of red vertices shifted by some rotation. So, if we rotate the octagon by k positions, then every blue vertex moves to the position of a red vertex. 

Let me think more formally. Let the octagon have vertices labeled 0 through 7 in order. Suppose we color each vertex either red or blue. Let R be the set of red vertices, and B be the set of blue vertices. Since each vertex is colored independently, R is a subset of {0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7}, and so is B, with |R| + |B| = 8.

We need to find the probability that there exists a rotation (i.e., a cyclic shift) such that when we apply that rotation to the octagon, every blue vertex moves to a position that was originally red. That is, for some rotation by k steps, the image of B under rotation is a subset of R. Wait, but since the rotation is a permutation, B and R must have the same size? Or no, because B could be a subset of R. 

Wait no, because after rotation, all blue vertices have to be mapped to red ones. So, if we rotate the octagon by k steps, then for each vertex i, the color at position i after rotation is the color at position (i - k) mod 8 before rotation. So, for all i, if vertex i is blue after rotation, then vertex (i - k) mod 8 was blue before rotation. But in the original coloring, vertex (i - k) mod 8 was red or blue. 

Wait, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Let
