Okay, so I've got this problem here where I need to find the number of intersections between two graphs. The functions are a bit complicated, so I need to break it down step by step.

First, let me write down the functions to make sure I understand them.

The first function is y = 4g(f(sin(2πx))). The second function is x = 4g(f(cos(3πy))). So, I need to find all pairs (x, y) that satisfy both equations. That means I need to figure out the points where y is determined by the first equation and x is determined by the second, and they intersect where both are true.

Let me start by understanding the inner functions f and g. The problem defines f(x) = ||x| - 1/2| and g(x) = ||x| - 1/4|. These functions involve absolute values, so they're going to create piecewise linear graphs with possible V-shapes or other linear segments.

I think it would help to graph f(x) and g(x) separately to see their forms.

Starting with f(x) = ||x| - 1/2|. Let me consider different cases for x.

Case 1: x >= 0, so |x| = x. Then f(x) = |x - 1/2|. So, this is a V-shape that's shifted. For x between 0 and 1/2, x - 1/2 is negative, so the absolute value becomes -(x - 1/2) = 1/2 - x. For x >= 1/2, it's x - 1/2. So, the graph of f(x) for x >= 0 is a V with the vertex at (1/2, 0).

But since it's ||x| -1/2|, and x can be negative as well, let me think about x < 0. Then |x| = -x, so f(x) = |(-x) - 1/2| = |-x -1/2|. This is the same as |x + 1/2|. So for x < 0, it's another V-shape. The vertex occurs when x + 1/2 = 0 → x = -1/2. So, for x < -1/2, it's -(x + 1/2) = -x -1/2. For x between -1/2 and 0, it's x + 1/2.

Putting it all together, f(x) is a piecewise function:

- For x <= -1/2: f(x) = -x - 1/2
- For -1/2 <= x <= 1/2: f(x) = |x| - 1/2? Wait, no. Wait, the outer absolute value complicates things. Wait, no—f(x) is ||x| - 1/2|. So, regardless of the sign of x, we take the absolute value of |x| minus 1/2.

Wait, perhaps I should consider f(x) as follows. Let me think of t = |x|. Then f(x) = |t - 1/2|. So, since t is always non-negative, |t - 1/2| is a V-shape with vertex at t = 1/2, which corresponds to x = ±1/2.

So, for t < 1/2 (i.e., |x| < 1/2), f(x) = 1/2 - t = 1/2 - |x|. For t >= 1/2 (|x| >= 1/2), f(x) = t - 1/2 = |x| - 1/2.

So, f(x) is a graph that is V-shaped with minima at x = ±1/2, f(x) = 0, and it goes up with slope -1 and +1
