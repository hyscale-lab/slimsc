Okay, so I've got this problem where I need to figure out how many ways I can fill a 2x3 grid with digits (0-9) such that two conditions are satisfied. The first condition is that when I read the grid left to right, the two numbers formed add up to 999. The second condition is that when I read the grid top to bottom, the three numbers formed add up to 99. 

Hmm, let me try to visualize the grid. It's a 2-row by 3-column grid. So, the top row has three cells, and the bottom row has three cells. Let me denote the grid as follows:

```
a b c
d e f
```

So, reading left to right, the top row forms a three-digit number, say ABC, which is 100a + 10b + c. Similarly, the bottom row forms DEF, which is 100d + 10e + f. According to the problem, ABC + DEF = 999. 

Wait, but actually, in the example given, the top row is 0 0 8, which is 008, but that's 8. The bottom row is 9 9 1, which is 991. So, 8 + 991 = 999. Oh, right, so the top row is a three-digit number but leading zeros are allowed. So ABC can be 000 to 999, same with DEF.

Similarly, reading top to bottom, each column forms a two-digit number. So, the first column is a and d, which is 10a + d. The second column is b and e, which is 10b + e. The third column is c and f, which is 10c + f. The sum of these three two-digit numbers should be 99. So, (10a + d) + (10b + e) + (10c + f) = 99.

So, let me write down the equations:

1. ABC + DEF = 999
   Which is (100a + 10b + c) + (100d + 10e + f) = 999.

2. Sum of columns: (10a + d) + (10b + e) + (10c + f) = 99.

So, we have two equations with six variables (a, b, c, d, e, f), each ranging from 0 to 9.

I need to find all possible assignments of a, b, c, d, e, f that satisfy these two equations.

Let me see if I can combine or simplify these equations. Maybe express one in terms of the other.

Looking at equation 2: Let's expand it:

10a + d + 10b + e + 10c + f = 99.

I can rearrange this as:

10(a + b + c) + (d + e + f) = 99.

Similarly, equation 1 is:

100a + 10b + c + 100d + 10e + f = 999.

Hmm, equation 1 can be written as 100(a + d) + 10(b + e) + (c + f) = 999. 

Wait, that's interesting. So equation 1 is 100(a + d) + 10(b + e) + (c + f) = 999.

And equation 2 is 10(a + b + c) + (d + e + f) = 99.

Let me denote S1 = a + d, S2 = b + e, S3 = c + f.

Then equation 1 becomes 100*S1 + 10*S2 + S3 = 999.

Equation 2 can be rewritten as 10*(a + b + c) + (d + e + f) = 99.

But a + b + c is equal to (a + b + c), and d + e + f is (d + e + f). Hmm, maybe I can relate this to S1, S2, S3.

Wait, S1 = a + d, S2 = b + e, S3 = c + f. So, (a + b + c) + (d + e + f) = (a + d) + (b + e) + (c + f) = S1 + S2 + S3.

But in equation 2, we have 10*(a + b + c) + (
