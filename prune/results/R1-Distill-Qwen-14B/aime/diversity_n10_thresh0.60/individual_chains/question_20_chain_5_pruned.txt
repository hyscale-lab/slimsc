Okay, so I've got this problem here about placing chips on a 5x5 grid. There are 25 white chips and 25 black chips, and I can use some of them. Each cell can have at most one chip. The conditions are that all chips in the same row must be the same color, and the same goes for all chips in the same column. Also, once I place the chips, if I try to add any more, it should violate one of these conditions. I need to find the number of ways to do this.

Hmm, let me try to understand the conditions better. So, for each row, all the chips in that row must be the same color. Similarly, for each column, all chips in that column must be the same color. So, this means that each row is either all white, all black, or has no chips? Wait, no, because the condition is only about the chips in the row. So, a row could have some chips, all white or all black, but the rest of the cells in the row can be empty. Wait, no, because each cell can have at most one chip. So, maybe each row is either all white, all black, or empty? But wait, no, that's not necessarily the case.

Wait, no. Let me think again. The condition is that all chips in the same row have the same color. So, if a row has any chips, all of them must be the same color. So, a row can have all white chips, all black chips, or no chips. Similarly, the same goes for the columns. So, each column can have all white, all black, or no chips.

Wait, but the second condition says that any additional chip placed would violate the previous two conditions. So, this implies that the placement is maximal, meaning that you can't add any more chips without violating the row or column condition. So, this is important because it restricts how we can place the chips.

So, for each row, if a row has any chips, they must all be the same color. Similarly, for each column, if a column has any chips, they must all be the same color. And the placement is maximal, so whenever you try to add a chip, it would violate either the row or column condition.

Hmm, I think the key is that each row and each column must be monochromatic if they have any chips. But when you place a chip, it affects both its row and column. So, for a cell (i,j), if I place a white chip there, then row i must be all white or all empty, and column j must be all white or all empty. Similarly for a black chip.

Wait, but if I place a white chip in (i,j), then row i must have all white chips if I place any more in that row, but if I don't place any more, it's just that cell. Similarly for column j. But since the placement is maximal, if I try to add a chip in a different cell, say (i,k), it's in the same row, so since row i already has a white chip, adding another would require it to be white as well. But if I try to add a black chip in (i,k), that would violate the condition because row i already has a
