Okay, so I have this math problem to solve. It says: Find the largest possible real part of \[(75+117i)z + \frac{96+144i}{z}\] where \( z \) is a complex number with \( |z| = 4 \).

Hmm, alright, let me try to unpack this step by step. I remember that when dealing with complex numbers, especially when their magnitudes are fixed, using polar form can be really helpful. Since \( |z| = 4 \), I can express \( z \) as \( 4e^{i\theta} \), where \( \theta \) is the argument of \( z \). That should simplify things a bit.

So, let me write \( z = 4e^{i\theta} \). Then, \( 1/z \) would be \( \frac{1}{4}e^{-i\theta} \) because \( |1/z| = 1 / |z| = 1/4 \), and the argument becomes negative. So far, so good.

Now, substituting \( z \) and \( 1/z \) into the given expression:

\[ (75 + 117i)z + \frac{96 + 144i}{z} = (75 + 117i) \cdot 4e^{i\theta} + (96 + 144i) \cdot \frac{1}{4}e^{-i\theta} \]

Let me compute each term separately to make it manageable.

First term: \( (75 + 117i) \cdot 4e^{i\theta} \)

Compute the scalar part: \( 75*4 = 300 \), \( 117*4 = 468 \). So this becomes \( 300 + 468i \) multiplied by \( e^{i\theta} \). Wait, actually, no. Because \( (75 + 117i) \times 4e^{i\theta} \) is the same as \( (75*4 + 117*4i) e^{i\theta} \), which is \( (300 + 468i)e^{i\theta} \).

Similarly, the second term: \( (96 + 144i) \cdot \frac{1}{4}e^{-i\theta} \). Let me compute the scalar part: \( 96/4 = 24 \), \( 144/4 = 36 \). So this becomes \( 24 + 36i \) multiplied by \( e^{-i\theta} \).

So now, the expression is:

\[ (300 + 468i)e^{i\theta} + (24 + 36i)e^{-i\theta} \]

Hmm. Now, to find the real part of this expression, because the problem asks for the largest possible real part. So I need to compute the real parts of each term and then add them together.

I recall that for any complex number \( a + ib \) multiplied by \( e^{i\theta} \), it's equivalent to rotating the complex number by angle \( \theta \), which can be expressed using cosine and sine. So, \( (a + ib)e^{i\theta} = a e^{i\theta} + ib e^{i\theta} = a(\cos\theta + i\sin\theta) + ib(\cos\theta + i\sin\theta) \).

Let me compute the real part of each term.

First term: \( (300 + 468i)e^{i\theta} \)
Real part: \( 300\cos\theta - 468\sin\theta \)
Because when you expand \( (a + ib)(\cos\theta + i\sin\theta) \), the real part is \( a\cos\theta - b\sin\theta \).

Second term: \( (24 + 36i)e^{-i\theta} \)
Real part: \( 24\cos\theta + 36\sin\theta \)
Wait, hold on. Because \( e^{-i\theta} = \cos\theta - i\sin\theta \), so when you multiply \( (24 + 36i)(\cos\theta - i\sin\theta) \), the real part would be \( 24\cos\theta + 36\sin\theta \). Let me double-check that.

Multiplying \( (24 + 36i)(\cos\theta - i\sin\theta) \):
= 24\cos\theta - 24i\sin\theta + 36i\cos\theta - 36i^2\sin\theta
= 24\cos\theta - 24i\sin\theta + 36i\cos\theta + 36\sin\theta (since \( i^2 = -1 \))
So, grouping real and imaginary parts:
Real: 24\cos\theta + 36\sin\theta
Imaginary: (-24\sin\theta + 36\cos\theta)i
Yes, that's correct. So the real part is \( 24\cos\theta + 36\sin\theta \).

So now,
