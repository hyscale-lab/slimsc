Okay, so I have this problem where Alice and Bob are playing a game with a stack of n tokens. They take turns, Alice first. Each turn, a player can remove either 1 or 4 tokens. The person who takes the last token wins. I need to find how many positive integers n ≤ 2024 allow Bob to have a winning strategy, no matter how Alice plays.

Hmm, let's think about this. It's a combinatorial game theory problem. I remember that in such games, positions can be classified as either winning or losing. A winning position is one where the current player can force a win, regardless of what the opponent does. A losing position is the opposite—no matter what the current player does, the opponent can force a win.

So, in this case, since Alice goes first, Bob can only win if the starting position n is a losing position for Alice. That means I need to find all n ≤ 2024 where n is a losing position.

How do we determine which positions are losing? I think we can use the concept of Grundy numbers or perhaps look for a pattern by examining small values of n.

Let me start by listing out the first few n and see if I can spot a pattern.

n=1: Alice takes 1 and wins. So Bob can't win here. So n=1 is a winning position for Alice.

n=2: Alice can take 1, leaving 1 for Bob. Bob then takes 1 and wins. Wait, no—if Alice takes 1, n=1 left, Bob takes it and wins. So Alice would not want to do that. Alternatively, Alice could take 4, but n=2, she can't take 4. So Alice's only move is to take 1, which allows Bob to take the last one and win. Wait, that means n=2 is a losing position for Alice. Wait, is that correct?

Wait, if n=2, Alice takes 1, leaving 1 for Bob, who then takes it and wins. So Alice loses. Alternatively, if Alice takes 4, but she can't because n=2 <4. So yes, n=2 is a losing position for Alice, meaning Bob can win. So n=2 is a losing position for the current player (Alice), so Bob can win when n=2.

Wait, but I'm getting confused. Let me clarify:

In game theory, a position is losing if every possible move leads to a winning position for the opponent.

So let's define positions as losing (P-position) or winning (N-position).

Base case: n=0 is a losing position because there are no moves to make. But in our case, the player to take the last token wins, so if n=0, the game is already over. So perhaps n=0 is a losing position.

Wait, no. If n=1, the player can take 1 and win. So n=1 is a winning position. If n=2, the player can take 1, leaving 1 for the opponent, which is a winning position for them. But wait, in this case, if the opponent is faced with n=1, they can take it and win. So n=2: taking 1 leads to opponent's win. Alternatively, can't take 4. So n=2 is a losing position for the current player.

Wait, that's confusing. Let me think again.

Let's list the positions step by step:

n=0: game ends. Not a valid position for play.

n=1: current player takes 1 and wins. So n=1 is a winning position (N-position).

n=2: current player can take 1, leaving n=1 for the opponent, who then can win. So the current player cannot force a win, so n=2 is a losing position (P-position).

n=3: current player can take 1, leaving n=2 (which is a P-position, so opponent is in a losing position). Therefore, n=3 is a winning position (N-position).

n=4: current player can take 4, leaving n=0. Opponent can't move, so current player wins. So n=4 is a winning position (N-position).

n=5: current player can take 1, leaving n=4 (which is N, so opponent can win). Or take 4, leaving n=1 (N, opponent can win). So all moves from n=5 lead to N positions, meaning n=5 is a P-position.

Wait, no. Wait, if n=5, taking 1 leaves n=4 (N-position, opponent can win). Taking 4 leaves n=1 (N-position, opponent can win). So yes, n=5 is a P-position.

n=6: current player can take 1, leaving n=5 (P-position, opponent loses). So n=6 is N-position.

n=7: current player can take 1, leaving n=6 (N-position). Or take 4, leaving n=3 (N-position). So all moves lead to N positions. Therefore, n=7 is a P-position.

n=8: current player can take 1, leaving n=7 (P-position). So n=8 is N-position because the current player can force the opponent into a losing position.

n=9: current player can take 1, leaving n=8 (N). Or take 4, leaving n=5 (P). So if the current player takes 4, opponent is left with P, meaning current player can force a win. So n=9 is N.

Wait, wait, perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, for n=5: P

n=6: can take 1→n=5(P) → so n=6 is N.

n=7: can take 1→n=6(N), or take 4→n=3(N). So both moves lead to N, so n=7 is
