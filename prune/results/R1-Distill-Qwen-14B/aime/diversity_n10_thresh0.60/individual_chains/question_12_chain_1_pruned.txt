Okay, so I have this math problem here about a 2x3 grid where I need to place digits (0-9) in each cell. The conditions are that when I read the grid left to right, each row forms a number, and the sum of these two numbers should be 999. Also, when I read the grid top to bottom, each column forms a number, and the sum of these three numbers should be 99. The example given is:

\[\begin{array}{|c|c|c|} \hline 0 & 0 & 8 \\ \hline 9 & 9 & 1 \\ \hline \end{array}\]

In this example, the first row is 008 (which is 8) and the second row is 991. Adding those gives 8 + 991 = 999. For the columns, the first column is 09 (which is 9), the second is 09 (another 9), and the third is 81. Adding those gives 9 + 9 + 81 = 99. That fits the conditions.

So, I need to find the number of such possible arrangements. Hmm. Let's break this down step by step.

First, let me visualize the grid. It's a 2x3 grid, so two rows and three columns. Each cell will have a digit. Let me denote the grid as follows:

\[
\begin{array}{|c|c|c|}
\hline
a & b & c \\
\hline
d & e & f \\
\hline
\end{array}
\]

So, a, b, c are the cells of the first row, d, e, f are the cells of the second row. So, the first number is the top row: abc, which is a three-digit number. The second number is def, another three-digit number. Their sum should be 999.

Similarly, when reading top to bottom, each column forms a two-digit number. So, the first column is ad, the second is be, the third is cf. The sum of these three two-digit numbers should be 99.

So, the two main equations I get are:

1. abc + def = 999
2. ad + be + cf = 99

Each of a, b, c, d, e, f is a digit from 0 to 9. Wait, but for abc and def, the first digits a and d could be zero? Because in the example, a is 0. So, yes, they can be zero, so abc could be a number like 008, which is effectively 8. Similarly, def could be 991, which is 991. So, in this case, the sum is 8 + 991 = 999.

Wait, but when we add abc and def, it's 999. So, abc is a three-digit number, but in reality, it can have leading zeros, so it's more accurate to say it's a three-digit string, but numerically it's a number from 0 to 999.

Similarly, def is another three-digit string (or number from 0 to 999). So, the sum of these two is 999.

So, equation 1: abc + def = 999.

Equation 2: ad + be + cf = 99.

Each letter is a digit from 0 to 9.

Let me think about how to model this. Maybe I can write abc and def as numbers in terms of their digits.

So, abc = 100a + 10b + c
def = 100d + 10e + f

So, equation 1 becomes:

100a + 10b + c + 100d + 10e + f = 999.

Similarly, the column sums:

ad is 10a + d

be is 10b + e

cf is 10c + f

So, equation 2 becomes:

(10a + d) + (10b + e) + (10c + f) = 99.

Simplify equation 2:

10a + d + 10b + e + 10c + f = 99

Which can be written as:

10(a + b + c) + (d + e + f) = 99.

Hmm, interesting. So, equation 2 is 10*(sum of a, b, c) + (sum of d, e, f) = 99.

Equation 1 is 100a + 10b + c + 100d + 10e + f = 999.

Let me see if I can relate the two equations.

Let me denote S1 = a + b + c

and S2 = d + e + f.

Then equation 2 becomes:

10*S1 + S2 = 99.

So, S2 = 99 - 10*S1.

Now, equation 1 is:

100a + 10b + c + 100d + 10e + f = 999.

I can write this as:

(100a + 10b + c) + (100d + 10e + f)
