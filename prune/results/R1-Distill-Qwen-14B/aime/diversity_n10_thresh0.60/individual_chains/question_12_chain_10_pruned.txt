Okay, so I need to find the number of ways to place digits in a 2x3 grid such that two conditions are satisfied. The first condition is that when reading the grid left to right for each row, the sum of the two numbers formed should be 999. The second condition is that when reading the grid top to bottom for each column, the sum of the three numbers formed should be 99. 

Let me try to visualize the grid. It's a 2x3 grid, meaning there are 2 rows and 3 columns. Each cell will contain a digit from 0 to 9. Let me denote the grid as follows:

a b c  
d e f  

So, the first row is a, b, c, and the second row is d, e, f. 

Now, when reading left to right for each row, the numbers formed are abc and def. So, mathematically, the sum of these two numbers should be 999. 

Similarly, when reading top to bottom for each column, the numbers formed are ad, be, and cf. So, the sum of these three two-digit numbers should be 99.

Let me write down these equations.

First, the sum of the two numbers formed by the rows:
abc + def = 999.

But wait, abc is a three-digit number, right? So, abc is 100a + 10b + c, and def is 100d + 10e + f. So, the equation becomes:

(100a + 10b + c) + (100d + 10e + f) = 999.

Simplify this equation:
100a + 10b + c + 100d + 10e + f = 999.

Group like terms:
(100a + 100d) + (10b + 10e) + (c + f) = 999.

Factor out the common factors:
100(a + d) + 10(b + e) + (c + f) = 999.

Now, let's look at the second condition. The sum of the three numbers formed by the columns, which are each two-digit numbers:

ad + be + cf = 99.

Each of these is a two-digit number, right? So, ad is 10a + d, be is 10b + e, and cf is 10c + f. So, the equation becomes:

(10a + d) + (10b + e) + (10c + f) = 99.

Simplify:
10a + d + 10b + e + 10c + f = 99.

Group like terms:
(10a + 10b + 10c) + (d + e + f) = 99.

Factor out the 10:
10(a + b + c) + (d + e + f) = 99.

So now I have two equations:

1) 100(a + d) + 10(b + e) + (c + f) = 999.

2) 10(a + b + c) + (d + e + f) = 99.

Hmm, okay. Let me denote some variables to make this easier. Let me let:

S1 = a + d  
S2 = b + e  
S3 = c + f  

So equation 1 becomes:

100*S1 + 10*S2 + S3 = 999.

Now, let's denote:

T1 = a + b + c  
T2 = d + e + f  

So equation 2 is:

10*T1 + T2 = 99.

So now I have:

Equation 1: 100S1 + 10S2 + S3 = 999.

Equation 2: 10T1 + T2 = 99.

But notice that T1 = a + b + c, and T2 = d + e + f. Let's see if we can relate T1 and T2 to S1, S2, S3.

Wait, because S1 = a + d, S2 = b + e, S3 = c + f. So, if we add S1 + S2 + S3, we get:

S1 + S2 + S3 = (a + d) + (b + e) + (c + f) = (a + b + c) + (d + e + f) = T1 + T2.

So, T1 + T2 = S1 + S2 + S3.

From equation 2, 10T1 + T2 = 99.

So, we can write T2 = 99 - 10T1.

Substitute into T1 + T2 = S1 + S2 + S3:

T1 + (99 - 10T1) = S1 + S2 + S3  
99 - 9T1 = S1 + S2 + S3.

So, S1 + S2 + S3 = 99 - 9T1.

Now, looking back at equation 1: 100S1 + 10S2 + S3 = 999.

Hmm, perhaps I can express S3 from equation
