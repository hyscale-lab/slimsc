Okay, so I have this problem here about placing chips on a 5x5 grid. There are 25 white chips and 25 black chips, but I don't have to use all of them. The conditions are that each cell can have at most one chip, all chips in the same row must be the same color, and all chips in the same column must be the same color. Plus, any additional chip would violate these conditions. Hmm, that sounds a bit tricky, but I'll try to break it down.

First, let me restate the problem in my own words. I have a 5x5 grid, so 25 cells. I can place either a white or black chip in each cell, but each cell can only have one chip. Now, if I look at any row, all the chips in that row must be the same color. Similarly, any column must have chips of the same color. So, for example, if I have a row with some white chips and some black, that's not allowed. Same for columns.

Wait, but the problem says "some of these chips," so I don't have to fill the entire grid. So I can have a grid where some cells are empty, some have white, some have black, but the constraints are that in any non-empty row, all chips are the same color, and same for columns. Also, the placement should be such that if I add any more chips, it would violate those conditions.

Wait, so the placement is maximal in the sense that I can't add any more chips without breaking the same-row or same-column color rule. So perhaps the grid is filled in such a way that for each row, if there's at least one chip, all the cells in that row are either filled with one color or are empty. Similarly for columns.

Wait, no. Because each cell can have at most one chip, and if a cell is empty, it's allowed. But the conditions are only about chips in the same row or column being the same color. So if a row has some chips, they all must be the same color, and similarly for columns.

So, for example, if I have a row where some cells have white chips and others are empty, that's allowed. But if I have a row with some white and some black, that's not allowed. Similarly for columns.

And the grid is such that you can't add any more chips without
