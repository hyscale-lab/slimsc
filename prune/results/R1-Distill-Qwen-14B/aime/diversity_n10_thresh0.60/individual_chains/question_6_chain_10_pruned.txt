Okay, so I have this problem where I'm supposed to find the number of intersections between two graphs. The first graph is y = 4 g(f(sin(2πx))), and the second is x = 4 g(f(cos(3πy))). Hmm, that looks a bit complicated with all these functions nested inside each other. Let me try to break it down step by step.

First, I need to understand what f(x) and g(x) are. The problem defines f(x) as ||x| - 1/2| and g(x) as ||x| - 1/4|. So both f and g are transformations of the absolute value function. Maybe I should graph these functions first to get a sense of their shapes.

Starting with f(x) = ||x| - 1/2|. The inner |x| is a V-shape with its vertex at (0,0). Then subtracting 1/2 would shift it down by 1/2 unit. But since it's inside another absolute value, it reflects any negative part back up. So f(x) is another V-shape, but shifted. Let me think about key points. When x is 0, f(0) = |0 - 1/2| = 1/2. When x is 1/2, f(1/2) = |1/2 - 1/2| = 0. Similarly, when x is -1/2, f(-1/2) = | -1/2 - 1/2 | = 1. So f(x) is a V with vertex at (0, 1/2), opening upwards, but with the arms meeting at (1/2, 0) and (-1/2, 0). So it's like an upside-down V between -1/2 and 1/2, and then V's outside of that.

Wait, no. Actually, since it's | |x| - 1/2 |, it's symmetric about the y-axis. So for x >= 0, f(x) = |x - 1/2|. So when x is 0, f(0)=1/2. At x=1/2, f(1/2)=0. For x>1/2, it's x-1/2 as is. For x between 0 and 1/2, it's 1/2 -x. So the graph is a V with vertex at (1/2, 0), but mirrored on both sides. Wait, no, because for x negative, |x| is positive, so same as for positive x. So f(x) is a V with vertex at (0, 1/2) but shifted down and up again. Hmm, maybe f(x) is a diamond shape, peaking at (0,1/2), and going down to (1/2, 0) and (-1/2, 0). So it's like a tent shape.

Similarly, g(x) = ||x| - 1/4|. So same idea but with 1/4. So for x=0, g(0)=1/4. At x=1/4, g(1/4)=0. For x>1/4, it's x-1/4. For x between 0 and 1/4, it's 1/4 -x. So g(x) is also a V-shape, vertex at (0,1/4), with arms going down to (1/4, 0) and (-1/4, 0).

Alright, now moving on to the composite functions. The first function is y = 4g(f(sin(2πx))). Let me break this down. Starting from the inside: sin(2πx) is a sine wave with period 1, since the period is 2π/(2π) = 1. So it's a sine wave that oscillates between -1 and 1, with a period of 1.

Then f is applied to sin(2πx). So f(sin(2πx)) = || sin(2πx) | - 1/2 |. Let's think about this. The sin function outputs between -1 and 1. Taking absolute value, |sin(2πx)| is between 0 and 1. Then subtract 1/2: | |sin(2πx)| - 1/2 |.

So, when |sin(2πx)| is greater than or equal to 1/2, f(sin(2πx)) = |sin(2πx)| - 1/2. When |sin(2πx)| is less than 1/2, f(sin(2πx)) = 1/2 - |sin(2πx)|.

So
