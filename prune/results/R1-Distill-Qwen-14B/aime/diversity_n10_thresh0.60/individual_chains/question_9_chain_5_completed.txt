Okay, so I've got this logarithm problem to solve. Let's see, the problem states that there are real numbers x and y, both greater than 1, such that log base x of y^x equals 10, and log base y of x^{4y} also equals 10. I need to find the product xy.

Hmm, okay, so I have two equations here involving logarithms with different bases. Both logs equal 10. I think I can convert these logarithmic equations into exponential form to make them easier to handle. Let me recall the logarithm property: log_b(a) = c is equivalent to b^c = a.

So, starting with the first equation: log_x(y^x) = 10. Using the property, this means x^10 = y^x. Hmm, that seems interesting. And the second equation is log_y(x^{4y}) = 10, which translates to y^10 = x^{4y}.

So now I have two equations:

1. x^10 = y^x
2. y^10 = x^{4y}

I need to find xy given these two equations. Maybe I can express one variable in terms of the other and substitute?

Let me see. From the first equation, x^10 = y^x. I can take both sides to the power of (1/x) to get y = (x^10)^(1/x) = x^(10/x). So y is x raised to the power of 10/x.

Let me write that down: y = x^(10/x).

Now, I can substitute this expression for y into the second equation. So the second equation becomes y^10 = x^{4y}, which is [x^(10/x)]^10 = x^{4y}.

Simplifying the left side: [x^(10/x)]^10 = x^(100/x). So now I have x^(100/x) = x^{4y}.

Since the bases are the same and x > 1, I can set the exponents equal to each other. So 100/x = 4y.

Wait, but y is expressed in terms of x as y = x^(10/x). So substituting that in, I get 100/x = 4 * x^(10/x).

Let me write that equation down: 100/x = 4 * x^(10/x).

Hmm, that looks a bit complicated. Maybe I can divide both sides by 4 to make it simpler: 25/x = x^(10/x).

Now, taking both sides to the power of x to eliminate the exponent on the right side. Let's see: [25/x]^x = x^{10}.

So (25/x)^x = x^10.

Hmm, that's a bit tricky. Maybe taking natural logarithms on both sides would help. Let's try that.

Taking ln of both sides: x * ln(25/x) = 10 * ln(x).

Expanding the left side: x [ ln(25) - ln(x) ] = 10 ln(x).

So, x ln(25) - x ln(x) = 10 ln(x).

Let me bring all terms to one side: x ln(25) - x ln(x) - 10 ln(x) = 0.

Factor out ln(x) from the last two terms: x ln(25) - ln(x) (x + 10) = 0.

Hmm, not so sure if that helps. Alternatively, let's write it as x ln(25/x) = 10 ln x.

Wait, perhaps I can write it as [x / 10] ln(25/x) = ln x.

Alternatively, let me think about whether I can find an appropriate substitution here. Let me set t = x, so maybe that doesn't help. Alternatively, perhaps I can let z = x^{1/x}, but not sure.

Wait, let's think differently. Let me denote a = x^{1/x}. Then, since a = x^{1/x}, taking both sides to the x power, we have a^x = x.

But not sure if that helps. Alternatively, maybe I can set t = ln x. Let's try that substitution.

Let t = ln x. Then x = e^t.

So, substituting into the equation x ln(25/x) = 10 ln x:

e^t * ln(25 / e^t) = 10 t.

Simplify ln(25 / e^t): ln(25) - ln(e^t) = ln(25) - t.

So the equation becomes e^t (ln(25) - t) = 10 t.

Expanding it: e^t ln(25) - e^t t = 10 t.

Hmm, that's a transcendental equation, which may not have a solution in terms of elementary functions. Maybe I can find a clever substitution or perhaps assume a value for t that satisfies the equation.

Wait, but perhaps I can find x such that x^(1/x) is something manageable. Let me think about possible integer values for x.

Wait, the problem states that x and y are greater than 1. Let's test some integer values for x to see if they satisfy the equation.

Let me try x=5. Then y = x^(10/x) = 5^(10/5)=5^2=25.

Then, let's check the second equation: y^10 = (25)^10 and x^{4y}=5^{4*25}=5^100.

But (25)^10 is (5^2)^10 =5^{20}, which is not equal to 5^100. So that doesn't work.

Wait, but maybe x=25? Let's see.

If x=25, then y=25^(10/25)=25^(2/5)= (5^2)^(2/5)=5^(4/5). Hmm, which is about 5^0.8, which is not an integer, but let's see.

Then y=5^(4/5). Let's compute y^10= [5^(4/5)]^10=5^(8). On the other side, x^{4y}=25^{4*5^(4/5)}.

Wait, 25 is 5^2, so 25^{4*5^(4/5)}= (5^2)^{4*5^(4/5)}=5^{8*5^(4/5)}.

But y^10 is 5^8, so we have 5^8 =5^{8*5^(4/5)}. Therefore, 8=8*5^(4/5). But 5^(4/5) is greater than 1, so 8*5^(4/5) is greater than 8, so this is not equal. So x=25 doesn't work.

Hmm, maybe x=16? Let's see.

Wait, perhaps I should think of x such that 10/x is an integer. Let's say 10/x = k, so x=10/k.

Then y = x^(10/x) = (10/k)^(k).

So then, from the second equation y^10 = x^{4y}.

Substituting y and x:

[(10/k)^k]^10 = (10/k)^{4*(10/k)^k}.

Which simplifies to (10/k)^{10k} = (10/k)^{4*(10/k)^k}.

Since the bases are the same, we can set the exponents equal:

10k = 4*(10/k)^k.

Hmm, that equation: 10k = 4*(10/k)^k.

Simplify both sides by dividing by 2: 5k = 2*(10/k)^k.

Hmm, not sure if that helps. Maybe testing small integer values for k.

Let me try k=1: then x=10/1=10. Then y=10^1=10. Then check second equation: y^10=10^10, and x^{4y}=10^{40}. 10^10 is not equal to 10^40. Nope.

k=2: Then x=10/2=5. Then y=5^(2)=25. As before, y^10=25^10=5^20, x^{4y}=5^{100}. Not equal.

k=5: x=10/5=2. Then y=2^(5)=32. Now compute y^10=32^10, x^{4y}=2^{128}.

32 is 2^5, so 32^10=(2^5)^10=2^50, and x^{4y}=2^{128}.

2^50 is not equal to 2^128. So no good.

k=10: x=10/10=1, but x must be >1, so invalid.

k=4: x=10/4=2.5. Then y=2.5^4= (5/2)^4=625/16≈39.0625. Then y^10≈(625/16)^10, which is a huge number. x^{4y}=2.5^{4*39.0625}=2.5^156.25. Hmm, not sure, but I don't think they are equal.

Wait, maybe k= something else. Or perhaps this approach isn't working. Let's think differently.

We had earlier that 25/x = x^{10/x}.

Wait, let me write that again: 25/x = x^{10/x}.

Let me take natural logs on both sides:

ln(25/x) = (10/x) ln x.

So, ln(25) - ln x = (10/x) ln x.

Let me rearrange this:

ln(25) = ln x + (10/x) ln x.

Factor ln x:

ln(25) = ln x [1 + 10/x].

Hmm, okay. Let me write that as:

ln(25) = ln x (1 + 10/x).

Let me denote t = ln x. Then, ln(25) = t (1 + 10/e^t).

Wait, because ln x = t, so x = e^t.

So substituting x = e^t into the equation:

ln(25) = t (1 + 10/e^t).

So,

t (1 + 10 e^{-t}) = ln(25).

Hmm, this looks a bit complicated. Maybe I can rearrange it.

Let me write:

t + (10 t)/e^t = ln(25).

Not sure if that helps. Perhaps I can make a substitution here, but it's not obvious.

Alternatively, perhaps I can assume that 1 + 10/x is a multiple of ln(25), but I'm not sure.

Wait, maybe if I let u = x^{1/x}, then as before, y = u^10.

Wait, but that might not directly help. Alternatively, perhaps try to express the equation in terms of u = x^{1/x}.

Wait, I'm getting stuck here. Maybe I should try a different substitution.

Wait, let me think about the relationship between x and y. We have y = x^{10/x}.

From the second equation, y^10 = x^{4y}.

Substituting y:

(x^{10/x})^10 = x^{4 * x^{10/x}}.

Simplify left side: x^{100/x}.

Right side: x^{4 x^{10/x}}.

Since the bases are the same and x>1, the exponents must be equal:

100/x = 4 x^{10/x}.

So, 100/x =4 x^{10/x}.

Divide both sides by 4:

25/x = x^{10/x}.

Wait, that's where I was earlier.

So, perhaps I can write this as x^{10/x} * x =25.

Which is x^{(10/x)+1} =25.

Alternatively, x^{(10 + x)/x} =25.

Hmm, 25 is 5^2, so maybe x is a power of 5. Let me suppose x=5^k for some k.

Then, x=5^k, so x^{(10 +x)/x}=(5^k)^{(10 +5^k)/5^k} =5^{k*(10 +5^k)/5^k}.

Set equal to 25=5^2. So the exponents must be equal:

k*(10 +5^k)/5^k =2.

Multiply both sides by 5^k:

k*(10 +5^k)=2*5^k.

So,

10k +k*5^k = 2*5^k.

Bring all terms to left:

10k +k*5^k -2*5^k=0.

Factor out 5^k:

10k +5^k(k -2)=0.

Hmm. Let me factor 5^k:

5^k(k -2) +10k=0.

Hmm, 5^k is always positive, so for the equation to hold, (k-2) must be negative because 10k is positive for k>0.

So, k-2 <0 => k<2.

So, let's try k=1. Then, 5^1(1-2)+10*1=5*(-1)+10= -5 +10=5≠0.

k=0.5: 5^{0.5} (0.5-2) +10*0.5= sqrt(5)*(-1.5)+5≈2.236*(-1.5)+5≈-3.354 +5=1.646≠0.

k=1. Let's see, tried that, got 5.

k= something else. Maybe k=2? Let's see: 5^2(2-2)+10*2=25*0 +20=20≠0.

Hmm, not working. Maybe k= something else.

Alternatively, perhaps x is 25. Let me check: x=25. Then, (10 +25)/25 =35/25=7/5.

So x^{7/5}=25. So 25^(7/5)= (5^2)^(7/5)=5^{14/5}=5^{2.8}≈250 approx. But 250 is much larger than 25, so that doesn't work.

Wait, perhaps I can rearrange the equation 100/x =4 x^{10/x} as 25/x =x^{10/x}.

Let me take both sides to the power of x: (25/x)^x =x^{10}.

So, (25/x)^x =x^{10}.

Take natural logs: x ln(25/x) =10 ln x.

Which brings us back to where we were before.

Alternatively, maybe I can set t = x^{1/x}, then ln t = (ln x)/x.

Wait, but I don't see an immediate way to use that.

Wait, maybe I can write the equation 25/x =x^{10/x} as follows:

Let me write 25/x = e^{(10/x) ln x}.

So,

25/x = e^{(10/x) ln x}.

Take natural log of both sides:

ln(25/x) = (10/x) ln x.

Which is the same as earlier.

Wait, perhaps I can rearrange this as:

ln(25) - ln x = (10/x) ln x.

Bring all terms to one side:

ln(25) = ln x + (10/x) ln x.

Factor ln x:

ln(25) = ln x [1 + 10/x].

So,

ln x = ln(25) / [1 + 10/x].

Hmm, but x is in the denominator. Maybe substitute u = 1/x.

Let u =1/x, so x=1/u. Then,

ln(1/u) = ln(25) / [1 + 10*(1/u)].

Simplify ln(1/u) = -ln u.

So,

- ln u = ln(25) / [1 + 10/u].

Multiply numerator and denominator on the right by u:

- ln u = (ln 25 * u) / (u +10).

So,

- ln u = (u ln 25)/(u +10).

Hmm, not sure if this is helpful. Maybe cross-multiplied:

- ln u (u +10) = u ln 25.

Which gives:

- u ln u -10 ln u = u ln 25.

Bring all terms to one side:

- u ln u -10 ln u -u ln 25 =0.

Factor terms:

- u (ln u + ln25) -10 ln u =0.

Hmm, maybe factor out ln u:

ln u (-u -10) - u ln25=0.

Not sure if that helps. Alternatively, perhaps I can write ln25 as 2 ln5.

So,

- u ln u -10 ln u - u*2 ln5=0.

Factor ln u:

ln u (-u -10) -2 u ln5=0.

Hmm, not helpful. Maybe I need to approach this numerically.

Alternatively, perhaps let’s make an assumption about x and y to see if they are powers of the same base.

Wait, from the first equation, x^10 = y^x.

If I take the 10th root of both sides: x = y^{x/10}.

But also, from the second equation, y^10 =x^{4y}, which can be written as y =x^{(4y)/10}=x^{(2y)/5}.

So now we have two expressions:

1. x = y^{x/10}

2. y =x^{2y/5}

Let me substitute equation 2 into equation 1.

So,

x = [x^{2y/5}]^{x/10} =x^{(2y/5)*(x/10)}=x^{(2y x)/(50)}=x^{(y x)/25}.

Thus,

x =x^{(y x)/25}.

Since x >1, I can take the logarithm base x of both sides:

1 = (y x)/25.

Thus,

y x =25.

So, the product xy is 25.

Wait, that's the answer? So xy=25.

Wait, let me check that carefully. Because this seems too straightforward, but let me see.

We have from the first substitution: x = y^{x/10}.

From the second substitution: y = x^{2y/5}.

Substituting y into x:

x = [x^{2y/5}]^{x/10} =x^{(2y x)/(5*10)}=x^{(y x)/25}.

Thus,

x =x^{(y x)/25}.

Since x>1, the exponents must be equal. So,

1 = (y x)/25.

Thus,

y x=25.

So, the product xy is 25.

Wait, so that's the answer? But let me make sure this makes sense.

If xy=25, then y=25/x.

Substituting back into the first equation: x^10 = y^x = (25/x)^x.

So,

x^10 = (25/x)^x.

Which is,

x^10 =25^x /x^x.

Multiply both sides by x^x:

x^{10 +x} =25^x.

Take natural logs:

(10 +x) ln x =x ln25.

So,

10 ln x +x ln x =x ln25.

Bring all terms to left:

10 ln x +x ln x -x ln25=0.

Factor:

10 ln x +x (ln x - ln25)=0.

Hmm, let me factor x:

10 ln x +x (ln(x/25))=0.

Hmmm. Let me see if this is consistent with the earlier equation.

Wait, we have from before:

From equation 25/x = x^{10/x}, which is equivalent to x^{10/x} *x=25.

Which is x^{(10 +x)/x}=25.

Which is same as x^{(10 +x)/x}=25.

So, [x^{1/x}]^{10 +x}=25.

But maybe I can write x^{1/x}=y^{1/10}, from the first equation.

Wait, getting a bit tangled. But since we've derived that xy=25, maybe that's correct.

Alternatively, maybe I can plug in xy=25 into the previous equations.

If xy=25, then y=25/x.

So from the first equation: x^10 = (25/x)^x.

Which is x^10 =25^x /x^x.

So,

x^{10 +x} =25^x.

Which is x^{x +10} =25^x.

Taking both sides to the power of 1/x:

x^{(x+10)/x} =25.

So,

x^{1 +10/x}=25.

Which is,

x * x^{10/x}=25.

But earlier, from y= x^{10/x}, so x^{10/x}= y.

Thus,

x * y =25.

Which is consistent with what we found earlier. So, indeed, xy=25.

So, the answer is 25.


The problem involves finding real numbers \( x \) and \( y \), both greater than 1, such that \( \log_x(y^x) = 10 \) and \( \log_y(x^{4y}) = 10 \). We aim to determine the product \( xy \).

Starting with the given logarithmic equations, we convert them into exponential form:
1. \( \log_x(y^x) = 10 \) implies \( x^{10} = y^x \).
2. \( \log_y(x^{4y}) = 10 \) implies \( y^{10} = x^{4y} \).

From the first equation, express \( y \) in terms of \( x \):
\[ y = x^{10/x} \]

Substitute \( y = x^{10/x} \) into the second equation:
\[ (x^{10/x})^{10} = x^{4y} \]
\[ x^{100/x} = x^{4y} \]

Since the bases are the same, set the exponents equal:
\[ \frac{100}{x} = 4y \]

Substitute \( y = x^{10/x} \) into this equation:
\[ \frac{100}{x} = 4x^{10/x} \]
\[ \frac{25}{x} = x^{10/x} \]

Take both sides to the power of \( x \):
\[ \left(\frac{25}{x}\right)^x = x^{10} \]
\[ \frac{25^x}{x^x} = x^{10} \]
\[ 25^x = x^{x + 10} \]

Taking the natural logarithm of both sides:
\[ x \ln(25) = (x + 10) \ln(x) \]

Rearranging terms:
\[ x \ln(25) - x \ln(x) - 10 \ln(x) = 0 \]
\[ x (\ln(25) - \ln(x)) - 10 \ln(x) = 0 \]

Let \( y = x^{10/x} \). Substitute this into the equation \( \frac{25}{x} = x^{10/x} \):
\[ \frac{25}{x} = y \]
\[ xy = 25 \]

Thus, the product \( xy \) is \( 25 \).

\boxed{25}
