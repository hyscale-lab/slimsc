Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the number of intersections between two graphs:

One is y = 4g(f(sin(2πx)))
and the other is x = 4g(f(cos(3πy)))

Hmm, f(x) is defined as ||x| - 1/2|, and g(x) is ||x| - 1/4|. So both f and g are functions that take an absolute value, subtract a fraction, and then take the absolute value again. That sounds like they'll produce V-shaped graphs with specific vertices.

Let me first try to understand what f(x) and g(x) look like.

Starting with f(x) = ||x| - 1/2|.

The inner part is |x| - 1/2. So the graph of |x| is a V with vertex at (0,0). Subtracting 1/2 shifts it down by 1/2, so the vertex moves to (0, -1/2). But since we're taking the absolute value again, any negative part will flip up.

So f(x) will have vertices where |x| - 1/2 = 0, which is at |x| = 1/2, so x = ±1/2. At x=1/2 and x=-1/2, f(x) is zero. Between -1/2 and 1/2, |x| - 1/2 is negative, so f(x) = | |x| - 1/2 | = 1/2 - |x|. So the graph of f(x) is a V-shape with vertex at (0,1/2), going down to (1/2, 0) and (-1/2, 0).

Similarly, g(x) = ||x| - 1/4|. The same idea applies. |x| - 1/4 has vertex at (0, -1/4), which when taking absolute value becomes a V with vertex at (0, 1/4), crossing the x-axis at x=±1/4.

So f(x) has a peak at 1/2, and g(x) has a peak at 1/4.

Now, let me think about how these functions are composed.

First, let's consider the function 4g(f(sin(2πx))). Let's break this down step by step.

Starting with sin(2πx), which is a sine wave with period 1 (since the period of sin(2πx) is 2π/(2π) = 1). The sine function ranges between -1 and 1. So f(sin(2πx)) = ||sin(2πx)| - 1/2|.

Let me analyze f(sin(2πx)).

Since sin(2πx) is between -1 and 1, |sin(2πx)| is between 0 and 1. Then, subtracting 1/2, so |sin(2πx)| - 1/2 can be negative or positive.

The points where |sin(2πx)| - 1/2 = 0 are when |sin(2πx)| = 1/2, which occurs at sin(2πx) = ±1/2. So, solving 2πx = π/6 + 2πk or 2πx = 5π/6 + 2πk, which gives x = 1/12 + k or x = 5/12 + k, for integer k.

So, between these points, the function f(sin(2πx)) would be either |sin(2πx) - 1/2| or |1/2 - sin(2πx)| depending on which is positive.

Wait, but since it's ||sin(2πx)| - 1/2|, it's always non-negative.

So, for |sin(2πx)| >= 1/2, f(sin(2πx)) = |sin(2πx)| - 1/2.

For |sin(2πx)| < 1/2, f(sin(2πx)) = 1/2 - |sin(2πx)|.

Then, g(f(sin(2πx))) = ||f(sin(2πx))| - 1/4|.

But since f(sin(2πx)) is always non-negative, this simplifies to |f(sin(2πx)) - 1/4|.

So, let's consider f(sin(2πx)):

When |sin(2πx)| >= 1/2, f = |sin(2πx)| - 1/2. Then, g(f) = |(|sin(2πx)| - 1/2) - 1/4| = ||sin(2πx)| - 3/4|.

Wait, no. Because f is ||x| - 1/2|, which is always non-negative, so when we plug into g, it's ||f(x) - 1/4|.

So, f(sin(2πx)) is either |sin(2πx)| - 1/2 when |sin(2πx)| >= 1/2, or 1/2 - |sin(2πx)| otherwise.

Then, g(f) is ||f - 1/4|.

So, let's break down g(f) into two cases:

Case 1: f >= 1/4. Then, g(f) = f - 1/4.

Which would be:

If |sin(2πx)| >= 1/2, then f = |sin(2πx)| - 1/2.

So, in this case, g(f) = (|sin(2πx)| - 1/2) - 1/4 = |sin(2πx)| - 3/4.

But this is only valid when |sin(2πx)| - 1/2 >= 1/4, which implies |sin(2πx)| >= 3/4.

Wait, no. Wait, when we have g(f) = ||f - 1/4|, but since f itself is non-negative, we can have two cases again.

Wait, perhaps it's better to consider all possibilities.

Alternatively, perhaps I should plot or imagine the behavior of these functions.

Alternatively, let me compute the possible outputs of f(sin(2πx)).

Since |sin(2πx)| ranges from 0 to 1, f(sin(2πx)) will be:

- For |sin(2πx)| >= 1/2: f = |sin(2πx)| - 1/2, which ranges from 0 to 1/2.
- For |sin(2πx)| < 1/2: f = 1/2 - |sin(2πx)|, which ranges from 1/4 to 1/2.

So, f(sin(2πx)) ranges from 0 to 1/2.

Then, g(f) = ||f - 1/4|.

Which is:

If f >= 1/4: g(f) = f - 1/4
If f < 1/4: g(f) = 1/4 - f

But wait, f ranges from 0 to 1/2. So:

When f is between 0 and 1/4: g(f) = 1/4 - f

When f is between 1/4 and 1/2: g(f) = f - 1/4

So, g(f) ranges from 0 to 1/4.

So, the maximum of g(f) is 1/4, achieved when f is either 0 or 1/2.

Wait, when f is 0, g(f) = 1/4 - 0 = 1/4.

When f is 1/2, g(f) = 1/2 - 1/4 = 1/4.

So the maximum of g(f) is 1/4, and the minimum is 0.

Therefore, 4g(f) will range from 0 to 1.

So, 4g(f(sin(2πx))) ranges from 0 to 1.

Similarly, for the other function, x = 4g(f(cos(3πy))).

Same reasoning applies: cos(3πy) ranges between -1 and 1, so |cos(3πy)| is between 0 and 1.

So, f(cos(3πy)) is ||cos(3πy)| - 1/2|, which is same as f(sin(2πx)).

Then, g(f(cos(3πy)))
