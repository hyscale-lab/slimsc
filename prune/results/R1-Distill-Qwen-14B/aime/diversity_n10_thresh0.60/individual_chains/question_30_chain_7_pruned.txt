Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the remainder when the product from k=0 to 12 of (2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k}) is divided by 1000. Here, ω is a 13th root of unity, and it's not equal to 1. Hmm, okay, let me try to unpack this step by step.

First, I remember that the 13th roots of unity are solutions to the equation x^13 = 1. So, ω^13 = 1, and ω ≠ 1. Also, the minimal polynomial for ω is the 13th cyclotomic polynomial, which is Φ_13(x) = x^12 + x^11 + ... + x + 1. That might come in handy later.

Now, the given product is from k=0 to 12 of (2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k}). Let me denote each term in the product as P_k = 2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k}. So, I need to compute the product P = ∏_{k=0}^{12} P_k.

Wait, but ω^0 is 1, right? So when k=0, P_0 = 2 - 2*1 + 1 = 2 - 2 + 1 = 1. That term is just 1, so the product from k=0 to 12 is the same as the product from k=1 to 12, since multiplying by 1 doesn't change the product. So, P = ∏_{k=1}^{12} (2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k}).

Hmm, okay, maybe I can factor out the 2 from each term? Let's see: 2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k} = 2(1 - ω^k) + ω^{2k}. Not sure if that helps. Alternatively, maybe I can write this as ω^{2k} - 2ω^k + 2. That might make it easier to see if there's a pattern or something I can factor.

Wait, another thought: Maybe I can express this as a quadratic in ω^k. Let me think about that. If I consider ω^k as x, then each term is 2 - 2x + x^2. So, P_k = x^2 - 2x + 2, where x = ω^k.

So, we have P = ∏_{k=1}^{12} (x^2 - 2x + 2), where each x is a 13th root of unity, except x ≠ 1. Since ω is a primitive 13th root, ω^k for k=1 to 12 are all the non-1 roots.

Now, I remember that for cyclotomic polynomials, the product over (x - ω^k) for k=1 to 12 is Φ_13(x) = x^12 + x^11 + ... + x + 1. But here, each term is a quadratic in ω^k. Maybe I can relate this product to a polynomial evaluated at certain points.

Alternatively, perhaps I can consider evaluating the product ∏_{k=1}^{12} (x^2 - 2x + 2) for x = ω^k. Wait, no, each term is evaluated at different x's. Hmm.

Wait, another approach: The product over k=1 to 12 of (a - ω^k) is equal to Φ_13(a), which is (a^13 - 1)/(a - 1) = a^12 + a^11 + ... + a + 1. But in our case, each term is quadratic
