Okay, so I've been given this problem about counting paths on an 8x8 grid. The goal is to find the number of paths of length 16 that change direction exactly four times. Hmm, let me try to unpack this and figure out how to approach it.

First, let's clarify the problem. An 8x8 grid means we have squares, right? So moving from the lower left corner to the upper right corner would require moving 8 steps to the right and 8 steps up, totaling 16 steps. Each path is a sequence of right (R) and up (U) moves. So, a path is like a string of 16 characters with 8 Rs and 8 Us.

Now, the key here is that these paths change direction exactly four times. I think this means that the path alternates between moving right and up, but only four times. So, how does that translate into the number of segments in each direction?

Wait, each time the direction changes, it's switching from right to up or up to right. So, if the path changes direction four times, how many segments of each direction do we have? Let's think.

Starting from the lower left, the first move is either right or up. Let's say the first move is right. Then, each change in direction alternates the movement. So, for four direction changes, the number of segments would be five, right? Because each change adds a new segment. So, if it starts with right, the path would be R, U, R, U, R, U, R, U, or something like that, but depending on the number of direction changes.

Wait, no. Let me think again. Suppose the path changes direction four times. So, the number of straight segments is one more than the number of direction changes. So, four direction changes lead to five segments. Each segment is a consecutive series of moves in one direction.

But each direction alternates, so if you start with right, the segments would be right, up, right, up, right. Similarly, starting with up, it's up, right, up, right, up. So, either way, the number of right segments and up segments would differ by one.

Wait, let's say we have five segments. If the path starts with right, then the segments are R, U, R, U, R. So, three right segments and two up segments. Alternatively, if it starts with up, then the segments are U, R, U, R, U, which is three up segments and two right segments.

So, in either case, one direction has three segments and the other has two. Now, the total number of right moves is 8, and the total number of up moves is 8.

So, if the path has three right segments and two up segments, then the sum of the lengths of the right segments is 8, and similarly for the up segments. Similarly, if it's three up and two right, same thing.

Therefore, the problem reduces to finding the number of ways to partition 8 into three parts (for the right segments) and 8 into two parts (for the up segments), or vice versa. But wait, we need to consider both starting directions, right?

Wait, no. Because the starting direction could be either right or up. So, the number of paths that start with right and have three R
