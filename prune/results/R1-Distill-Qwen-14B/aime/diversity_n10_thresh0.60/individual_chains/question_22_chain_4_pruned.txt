Alright, so I have this problem about a convex equilateral hexagon where all pairs of opposite sides are parallel. The hexagon is labeled ABCDEF. The problem says that the triangle formed by extending the sides AB, CD, and EF has side lengths 200, 240, and 300. I need to find the side length of the hexagon.

First, let me make sure I understand the problem correctly. A convex equilateral hexagon means all its sides are equal in length, and all internal angles are less than 180 degrees. Also, opposite sides are parallel, which suggests that this might be a special type of hexagon, perhaps similar to a regular hexagon but not necessarily with all angles equal.

The triangle formed by extending AB, CD, and EF has sides of lengths 200, 240, and 300. I'm trying to visualize this. So, if I extend the sides AB, CD, and EF, they meet to form a triangle. The lengths of the sides of this triangle are given, which might be related to the side lengths of the hexagon, but I'm not sure exactly how yet.

I remember that in a convex hexagon with opposite sides parallel, the hexagon can be thought of as being formed by three pairs of parallel sides. Since it's equilateral, each pair of opposite sides is not only parallel but also equal in length. So, AB is parallel and equal to DE, BC is parallel and equal to EF, and CD is parallel and equal to FA.

Wait, no, that might not be correct. In a general convex equilateral hexagon with opposite sides parallel, each pair of opposite sides are parallel and equal. So AB is parallel and equal to DE, BC parallel and equal to EF, and CD parallel and equal to FA. So each side is equal to its opposite side.

Now, the triangle formed by the extensions of AB, CD, and EF. Let me try to sketch this mentally. If I extend AB, CD, and EF, they meet at points forming a triangle. Let me denote the triangle as XYZ, where X is the intersection of the extensions of AB and CD, Y is the intersection of CD and EF, and Z is the intersection of EF and AB.

Wait, no. Actually, if I extend AB, CD, and EF, their extensions would meet at certain points. Since AB is a side of the hexagon, when extended, it will meet the extension of CD at some point, and similarly for the other sides.

Wait, perhaps it's better to assign a figure. But since I can't draw, I'll have to imagine it. Let me think of the hexagon as sitting inside the triangle XYZ, with each pair of opposite sides being extensions from the sides of XYZ.

Alternatively, perhaps the hexagon is similar to the triangle but scaled down. Hmm, not necessarily. Alternatively, maybe the triangle is similar but scaled up.

I think the key here is to model the hexagon in terms of the triangle. Since the hexagon is equilateral and has opposite sides parallel, it can be constructed by cutting off smaller similar triangles from the corners of the larger triangle XYZ.

Wait, yes, that might make sense. If we have a large triangle XYZ, and we cut off smaller triangles from its corners, each cut being parallel to a side, we would end up with a hexagon. Since the hexagon is equilateral and opposite sides are parallel, each of these smaller triangles would be similar to the original triangle XYZ.

So, in this case, the hexagon ABCDEF is formed by cutting off three smaller triangles from the corners of the triangle XYZ, each of which is similar to XYZ. The sides of the hexagon would then be equal in length, each corresponding to the sides of these smaller triangles.

But wait, if each side of the hexagon is equal, then each of these smaller triangles must be congruent, right? Because otherwise, the sides of the hexagon would not all be equal. So, perhaps all three smaller triangles are congruent.

Wait, but the problem says the hexagon is convex and equilateral with opposite sides parallel. If I'm cutting off congruent triangles from each corner of XYZ, then the resulting hexagon would indeed have all sides equal and opposite sides parallel.

But let me
