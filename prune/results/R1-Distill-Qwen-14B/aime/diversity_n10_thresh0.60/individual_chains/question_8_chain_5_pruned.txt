Okay, so I've come across this problem, and I need to find the number of triples of nonnegative integers (a, b, c) that satisfy two conditions: a + b + c = 300 and a²b + a²c + b²a + b²c + c²a + c²b = 6,000,000. Hmm, seems a bit involved, but let me break it down.

First, I know that solving for triples with a sum and another equation often involves some algebraic manipulation or maybe even symmetric functions. The first equation is straightforward: a + b + c = 300. The second equation is a bit more complex, but I notice that it's symmetric in a, b, c. That makes me think that maybe I can express it in terms of symmetric sums.

Let me write out the second equation again:

a²b + a²c + b²a + b²c + c²a + c²b = 6,000,000.

Hmm, maybe I can factor this expression. Let me see, each term is a product of two different variables, where one is squared. So, for example, a²b and a²c both have a² multiplied by another variable. So perhaps I can factor a² from those terms. Let me try that.

a²b + a²c = a²(b + c). Similarly, b²a + b²c = b²(a + c), and c²a + c²b = c²(a + b). So putting it together, the entire expression becomes:

a²(b + c) + b²(a + c) + c²(a + b) = 6,000,000.

Now, since we know that a + b + c = 300, we can express (b + c) as (300 - a), (a + c) as (300 - b), and (a + b) as (300 - c). Let's substitute these into the equation.

So, substituting, we get:

a²(300 - a) + b²(300 - b) + c²(300 - c) = 6,000,000.

Hmm, that might be helpful. Let me write that as:

300a² - a³ + 300b² - b³ + 300c² - c³ = 6,000,000.

I can factor out the 300 from the terms:

300(a² + b² + c²) - (a³ + b³ + c³) = 6,000,000.

Dividing both sides by 300, we get:

(a² + b² + c²) - (a³ + b³ + c³)/300 = 20,000.

Hmm, maybe that's not the best way to proceed. Alternatively, perhaps I can use the first equation to express one variable in terms of the others. Let's say, c = 300 - a - b. Then, substitute this into the second equation. That way, we can reduce the problem to two variables, a and b, and perhaps find some constraints.

Substituting c = 300 - a - b into the second equation:

a²b + a²c + b²a + b²c + c²a + c²b = 6,000,000.

Let's replace c with (300 - a - b):

a²b + a²(300 - a - b) + b²a + b²(300 - a - b) + (300 - a - b)²a + (300 - a - b)²b = 6,000,000.

That looks complicated, but let's try expanding each term step by step.

First term: a²b.

Second term: a²(300 - a - b) = 300a² - a³ - a²b.

Third term: b²a.

Fourth term: b²(300 - a - b) = 300b² - a b² - b³.

Fifth term: (300 - a - b)²a. Let's expand (300 - a - b)² first: that's 300² - 2*300*(a + b) + (a + b)².

So, (300 - a - b)²a = [90,000 - 600(a + b) + (a² + 2ab + b²)]a = 90,000a - 600a(a + b) + a(a² + 2ab + b²).

Similarly, sixth term: (300 - a - b)²b = [90,000 - 600(a + b) + (a² + 2ab + b²)]b = 90,000b - 600b(a + b) + b(a² + 2ab + b²).

Now, let's substitute all these back into the equation.

Let me write all the terms:

1. a²b
2. + 300a² - a³ - a²b
3. + b²a
4. + 300b² - a b² - b³
5. + 90,000a - 600a² - 600ab + a³ + 2a²b + a b²
6. + 90,000b - 600ab - 600b² + a²b + 2ab² + b³

Now, let's combine all these terms.

First, let me list all the terms:

From term 1: a²b

Term 2: +300a² -a³ -a²b

Term3: +b²a

Term4: +300b² -a b² -b³

Term5: +90,000a -600a² -600ab +a³ +2a²b +a b²

Term6: +90,000b -600ab -600b² +a²b +2ab² +b³

Now, let's collect like terms:

Let's start with the a³ terms.

-a³ (from term2) and +a³ (from term5) cancel each other out. So a³ terms: 0.

Similarly, b³ terms: -b³ (term4) and +b³ (term6) cancel out. So b³ terms: 0.

Now, a²b terms:

Term1: +a²b

Term2: -a²b

Term5: +2a²b

Term6: +a²b

So total a²b: (1 -1 +2 +1) a²b = 3a²b.

Similarly, a b² terms:

Term3: +ab²

Term4: -ab²

Term5: +ab²

Term6: +2ab²

Total a b²: (1 -1 +1 +2) ab² = 3ab².

Now, a² terms:

Term2: +300a²

Term5: -600a²

Total a²: (300 -600) a² = -300a².

Similarly, b² terms:

Term4: +300b²

Term5: +0 (no b² term in term5 except in ab²)

Wait, no, term5 has a b² term in the expansion of (300 - a - b)^2 a, which is a b² term. Wait, no, term5: when expanded, the term has a b² in the a²b² term? No, wait, let me check again.

Wait, in term5, the expansion is:

90,000a -600a(a + b) + a(a² + 2ab + b²)

Which is 90,000a -600a² -600ab + a³ + 2a²b + a b².

So the a² terms: -600a².

a b² terms: +a b².

Similarly, term6: 

90,000b -600b(a + b) + b(a² + 2ab + b²)

=90,000b -600ab -600b² + a²b + 2ab² + b³.

So, a²b and ab² terms in term6: +a²b and +2ab².

So for b² terms, in term4: +300b².

In term5: There's no b² except in ab² terms.

Wait, term5: the b² terms are part of the a b², which is a term with a and b², not just b².

So for pure b² terms, term4: +300b².

Term5: no pure b².

Term6: -600b².

So combining:

Term4: +300b²

Term6: -600b²

Total: (300 -600) b² = -300b².

Now, linear terms:

Term5: +90,000a

Term6: +90,000b

So total linear terms: 90,000a + 90,000b.

Now, ab terms:

Term2: -600ab

Term5: -600ab

Term6: -600ab

Term5: +2a²b and term6: +2ab², but those are already accounted for in the a²b and ab² terms.

Wait, no, the ab terms:

Looking back:

Term2: no ab term except the one in the expansion.

Wait, term5: -600ab.

Term6: -600ab.

So, from term5 and term6, both have -600ab each. So total ab terms: -600ab -600ab = -1200ab.

So putting it all together:

After combining all terms, we have:

3a²b + 3ab² -300a² -300b² +90,000a +90,000b -1200ab = 6,000,000.

Hmm, that's a bit complicated, but maybe I can factor out some common terms or find a way to simplify.

Let me factor out the 3 from some terms:

3(a²b + ab²) -300(a² + b²) +90,000(a + b) -1200ab = 6,000,000.

Hmm, perhaps I can factor 3 from the first two terms, 300 from the next two, etc.

Wait, let me see:

3a²b + 3ab² = 3ab(a + b).

Similarly, -300(a² + b²) = -300(a² + b²).

And 90,000(a + b) = 90,000(a + b).

-1200ab = -1200ab.

So putting it together:

3ab(a + b) -300(a² + b²) +90,000(a + b) -1200
