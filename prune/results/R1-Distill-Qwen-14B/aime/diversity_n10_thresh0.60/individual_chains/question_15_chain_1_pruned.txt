Okay, so I have this problem about counting paths on an 8x8 grid. The paths go from the lower left corner to the upper right corner, and each path has a length of 16. I need to find the number of such paths that change direction exactly four times.

Hmm, let me visualize this grid. It's an 8x8 grid, which I think means there are 8 squares along each side, so the grid has 9 horizontal and 9 vertical lines. To get from the lower left to the upper right, a path would consist of moving right and up steps. Since it's 8x8, you have to move 8 steps right and 8 steps up, totaling 16 steps.

Wait, but the problem says the paths have a length of 16. Oh, that makes sense because moving from one corner to the opposite on an 8x8 grid requires 8 right and 8 up moves, which is 16 moves.

Now, the key part is that the path changes direction exactly four times. So, I need to figure out how the number of direction changes relates to the number of straight segments in the path.

Let me think. Each time the path changes direction, it switches from moving right to up or vice versa. So, a path that changes direction once would go straight right for a bit, then straight up, then maybe right again, etc. Wait, no, actually, each direction change adds a new segment.

So, if a path changes direction k times, how many segments does it have? Let's see, starting from the first move, each direction change adds a new segment. So, for example, if you change direction once, you have two segments. So, in general, the number of direction changes is one less than the number of segments. So, if you have four direction changes, you have five segments.

Wait, is that right? Let me check. Starting direction: say right. Then, first direction change: switch to up, that's one change, two segments. Second change: switch back to right, three segments. Wait, no. Wait, no. Wait, no, each direction change adds a new segment, but whether it's right or up alternates.

So, starting right: one segment. Change direction once: now moving up, two segments. Change direction twice: moving right again, three segments. So, each change adds a new segment. So, four direction changes would lead to five segments. So, the number of direction changes is equal to the number of segments minus one.

So, if we have four direction changes, the path is made up of five segments. Each segment is either a horizontal (right) or vertical (up) move.

Now, each segment must consist of at least one step, right? Because you can't have a segment of zero steps. So, each of these five segments must be at least one step.

But wait, in our case, the total number of right steps is 8 and the total number of up steps is 8. So, we need to distribute these steps into horizontal and vertical segments.

Let me formalize this. Let's denote that the path has h horizontal segments (right moves) and v vertical segments (up moves). Since each direction change alternates between horizontal and vertical, the number of horizontal and vertical segments must differ by at most one.

Given that there are five segments, the number of
