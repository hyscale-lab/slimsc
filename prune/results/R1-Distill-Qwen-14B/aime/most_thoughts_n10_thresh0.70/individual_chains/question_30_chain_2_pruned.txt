Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the remainder when the product from k=0 to 12 of (2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k}) is divided by 1000. Here, ω is a 13th root of unity, and ω isn't equal to 1. Hmm, 13th roots of unity are complex numbers, right? So ω satisfies ω^13 = 1, but ω ≠ 1.

Let me write down what I know. The product is over k from 0 to 12 of (2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k}). Since ω^13 = 1, ω^k cycles every 13 terms, which is why k goes up to 12. So each term in the product is a function of ω^k.

Wait, the exponents here are 2k, so ω^{2k} is another root of unity. Since ω^13 = 1, ω^{2k} will cycle through as well, but perhaps with a different period. Let me think—since 2 and 13 are coprime, the powers of ω^2 will also generate all the 13th roots of unity as k goes from 0 to 12. So the exponents 2k modulo 13 will produce all residues from 0 to 12, just in a different order.

But maybe I don't need to worry about that for now. Let me see the expression inside the product: 2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k}. Maybe I can factor this or find a pattern.

Wait, 2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k} can be rewritten. Let me see: 2 - 2ω^k + (ω^k)^2. So if I let x = ω^k, then each term becomes 2 - 2x + x^2. So the product becomes the product over x = ω^k of (2 - 2x + x^2).

But since ω is a primitive 13th root, x will take on all the 13th roots of unity except 1, because when k=0, x=ω^0=1, but ω ≠ 1, so maybe when k=0, we have to handle that case separately. Wait, no, in the problem statement, ω ≠ 1 is a 13th root of unity, so k runs from 0 to 12, including k=0. So x=1 is included when k=0.

So the entire product includes the term when k=0, which is 2 - 2*1 + 1^2 = 2 - 2 + 1 = 1. So that term is 1, and the rest of the terms are for k=1 to 12, so x runs through all the non-1 13th roots of unity.

So the product is 1 multiplied by the product over x (where x runs through all 13th roots of unity except 1) of (2 - 2x + x^2). Wait, but I just realized that when k=0, x=1, and that term is 1, as I saw. So maybe I can factor the entire product as the product from k=0 to 12 of (2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k}) = 1 * product_{k=1 to 12} (2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k}).

But perhaps there's a smarter way to compute this product. Since all the ω^k are roots of x^13 - 1 = 0, except x=1, maybe I can relate the product to some polynomial evaluated at certain points.

Alternatively, I know that for a polynomial f(x), the product over its roots can be related to its
