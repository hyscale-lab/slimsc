Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the remainder when the product from k=0 to 12 of (2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k}) is divided by 1000. ω is a 13th root of unity, not equal to 1. Hmm, that sounds a bit complicated, but let me break it down.

First, I know that ω is a primitive 13th root of unity, so ω^13 = 1, and the powers of ω from 0 to 12 give all the distinct roots. So, ω^k for k=0 to 12 are all the 13th roots of unity.

The expression I need to compute is the product: Π_{k=0}^{12} (2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k}). Let me write that out more clearly. Each term in the product is 2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k}. Hmm, maybe I can factor this expression or find a pattern.

Wait, 2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k} looks like a quadratic in ω^k. Let me let x = ω^k, then each term becomes 2 - 2x + x^2. Let me write that as x^2 - 2x + 2. Hmm, does that factor? Let me check the discriminant: b² - 4ac = 4 - 8 = -4. So, it doesn't factor over the reals, but maybe over the complex numbers?

Alternatively, perhaps I can relate this quadratic to some cyclotomic polynomial or something. Cyclotomic polynomials are minimal polynomials over the integers for roots of unity. The 13th cyclotomic polynomial is Φ_13(x) = x^12 + x^11 + ... + x + 1. But I'm not sure if that's directly helpful here.

Alternatively, maybe I can write the product as Π_{k=0}^{12} (x^2 - 2x + 2) where x = ω^k. But wait, since ω^k runs through all 13th roots of unity, except ω^0 = 1, but actually, when k=0, ω^0=1, so x=1, so the term becomes 1 - 2 + 2 = 1. So, the product when k=0 is 1. So, I can write the entire product as 1 * Π_{k=1}^{12} (1 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k}).

Wait, no, wait: when k=0, x=1, so 2 - 2*1 + 1^2 = 2 - 2 + 1 = 1. So the k=0 term is 1, so the entire product is 1 multiplied by the product from k=1 to 12. So, maybe I can focus on that.

So, the product is Π_{k=1}^{12} (1 -
