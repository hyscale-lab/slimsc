Okay, so I've got this math problem here. Let me read it carefully and try to figure it out step by step. 

The problem says: Among the 900 residents of Aimeville, there are 195 who own a diamond ring, 367 who own a set of golf clubs, and 562 who own a garden spade. Additionally, each of the 900 residents owns a bag of candy hearts. So, every resident has at least one of these four items. 

Wait, no, actually, the problem says each resident owns a bag of candy hearts. So, that means 100% of the residents have candy hearts. But the other three items (diamond ring, golf clubs, garden spade) are owned by varying numbers of people. 

Then it goes on: There are 437 residents who own exactly two of these things, and 234 residents who own exactly three of these things. The question is to find the number of residents who own all four of these things. 

Hmm. So, I think this is a problem involving sets and their intersections. Probably using the principle of inclusion-exclusion. Let me recall how that works.

Inclusion-exclusion is used to calculate the size of the union of multiple sets by adding the sizes of the individual sets, subtracting the sizes of all possible two-set intersections, adding back in the sizes of all possible three-set intersections, and so on. 

But in this problem, we're not directly given the sizes of the intersections. Instead, we know the number of people who own exactly two items and exactly three items. 

Wait, so let's break down the information:

Total residents, n = 900.

Number with diamond ring, D = 195.

Number with golf clubs, G = 367.

Number with garden spade, S = 562.

Number with candy hearts, C = 900 (since every resident has this).

We also have:

Number of residents with exactly two items, exactly_two = 437.

Number of residents with exactly three items, exactly_three = 234.

We need to find the number of residents with all four items, which we can denote as x.

Wait, but all residents have candy hearts, so C is universal. So, every resident is in C. So, actually, when we say someone owns, say, a diamond ring, they also have the candy hearts. So, the sets D, G, S are subsets of C.

So, the problem is about four sets: D, G, S, C, with C being the universal set.

But since C is universal, the problem reduces to finding the number of people who have D, G, S, and C—all four, but since C is everyone, it's just D∩G∩S.

Wait no, because if someone has all four, it's D∩G∩S∩C, but since C includes everyone, it's just D∩G∩S. So, the number of people with all four is the same as the number with D, G, and S.

But regardless, let's try to model this.

In inclusion-exclusion, the formula for four sets is:

|D ∪ G ∪ S ∪ C| = |D| + |G| + |S| + |C| - |D∩G| - |D∩S| - |G∩S| - |D∩C| - |G∩C| - |S∩C| + |D∩G∩S| + |D∩G∩C| + |D∩S∩C| + |G∩S∩C| - |D∩G∩S∩C|

But since C is the universal set, |C| = 900, and any intersection with C is just the other set. For example, D∩C is D, G∩C is G, and so on. So, all the sets D, G, S are subsets of C.

So, for the formula, I think that the unions will just be the same as D ∪ G ∪ S, because C is everything. So, |D ∪ G ∪ S ∪ C| is just |C|, which is 900.

So, the inclusion-exclusion formula simplifies here:

900 = |D| + |G| + |S| + |C| - |D∩G| - |D∩S| - |G∩S| - |D∩C| - |G∩C| - |S∩C| + |D∩G∩S| + |D∩G∩C| + |D∩S∩C| + |G∩S∩C| - |D∩G∩S∩C|

But wait, since D is a subset of C, D∩C is D, same for G and S. Similarly, any three-way intersection with C is just the other two sets intersected. For example, D∩G∩C is just D∩G. Similarly, all the three-way intersections involving C are just the three-way intersections.

But wait, the four-way intersection is D∩G∩S∩C, which is just D∩G∩S, since C is universal.

So, let's substitute all that into the equation.

First, let's write all the terms:

|D| = 195, |G|=367, |S|=562, |C|=900.

Now, let's compute each part:

The first sum is |D| + |G| + |S| + |C| = 195 + 367 + 562 + 900.

Let me calculate that: 195 + 367 is 562, plus 562 is 1124, plus 900 is 2024.

Then, we subtract the pairwise intersections:

- |D∩G| - |D∩S| - |G∩S| - |D∩C| - |G∩C| - |S∩C|

But |D∩C| is |D| = 195, |G∩C|=|G|=367, |S∩C|=|S|=562.

So, the terms to subtract are |D∩G|, |D∩S|, |G∩S|, plus 195, 367, 562.

Wait, so the subtraction part is:

- (|D∩G| + |D∩S| + |G∩S| + 195 + 367 + 562)

Let me compute that: 195 + 367 is 562, plus 562 is 1124. So, 195 + 367 +562 = 1124.

So, the subtraction becomes:

- (|D∩G| + |D∩S| + |G∩S| + 1124)

Next, we add back the three-way intersections:

+ |D∩G∩S| + |D∩G∩C| + |D∩S∩C| + |G∩S∩C|

But |D∩G∩C| is |D∩G|, because C is universal. Similarly, |D∩S∩C| is |D∩S|, and |G∩S∩C| is |G∩S|.

So, the three-way intersections being added are |D∩G∩S| + |D∩G| + |D∩S| + |G∩S|

Wait, no. Let me re-express:

The three-way intersections in inclusion-exclusion are all possible combinations. So, they are:

- |D∩G∩S| (all three)
- |D∩G∩C| (D, G, and C)
- |D∩S∩C| (D, S, and C)
- |G∩S∩C| (G, S, and C)

But since C is universal, each of these is just |D∩G|, |D∩S|, |G∩S| respectively. Because D∩G∩C is D∩G, since C includes everyone.

So, the three-way terms are |D∩G∩S| + |D∩G| + |D∩S| + |G∩S|

Wait, but that's four terms. But in the inclusion-exclusion formula for four sets, the three-way intersections are the combinations where you choose any three of the four sets. So, in this case, D, G, S, and C, but since C is universal, the three-way intersections not involving all three of D, G, S would just be the pairwise intersections. Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused here.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to model the problem in terms of exactly two and exactly three.

Wait, another approach: Since all residents have C (candy hearts), the problem can be thought of as four sets D, G, S, and C, with C being the universal set. So the entire universe is C.

Therefore, when considering the union of D, G, and S, it's the same as the union within C.

But perhaps another way: Let me consider that each resident has at least C, so the four categories are C (which everyone has), D, G, S.

But perhaps it's better to model the problem without considering C, since it's the universal set. Let me denote the three sets D, G, S as subsets of C. So, the problem is about D, G, S, and C. But C is universal, so every resident is in C.

So, the number of people who have all four is equal to the number of people who have D, G, and S, because C is universal.

So, the problem reduces to finding |D ∩ G ∩ S|, which is the number of people who have all three of D, G, S, and hence also have C.

Wait, but the problem gives the number of people with exactly two of the four things and exactly three. But since C is universal, any resident has at least C. So, the count of exactly two would be the count of people who have exactly two of D, G, S, because they also have C. Similarly, exactly three would be the count of people who have exactly three of D, G, S, because they also have C. And the people who have all four would be the same as those who have all three of D, G, S.

So, perhaps I can model this as:

Total residents = 900.

Each resident has C, so the other three (D, G, S) are optional.

We have:

Number of people with exactly two of D, G, S, and C = 437.

Number with exactly three of D, G, S, and C = 234.

Number with all four (which is same as D∩G∩S) = x (which is what we need to find).

Now, the inclusion-exclusion principle for three sets D, G, S is:

|D ∪ G ∪ S| = |D| + |G| + |S| - |D∩G| - |D∩S| - |G∩S| + |D∩G∩S|

But since every resident is in C, and we're considering only D, G, S, the union |D ∪ G ∪ S| is the number of residents who have at least one of D, G, S. But since all residents have C, but some may not have any of D, G, S.

Wait, but the problem states that each resident owns a bag of candy hearts, but not necessarily any of the other three. So, some residents might have only C, others have C and one or more of D, G, S.

Wait, but the problem says there are 437 with exactly two of the four things. Since they have to have C, exactly two would mean they have C plus one other.

Wait, but that's not correct. Wait, wait. No, if they have exactly two of the four, that includes C. So, for example, a resident could have C and D, but no G or S. Or C and G, etc., or C and D and G, but then that's three, so that's not exactly two.

Wait, no. Wait, the problem says "exactly two of these things." So, if someone has exactly two, it's two of the four: C, D, G, S. So, C is one of them, but they can't have all four, obviously. So, someone with exactly two would have C plus one more, like C and D, but not G or S. Or C and G, etc.

Similarly, someone with exactly three would have C plus two others, like C, D, and G, but not S.

And someone with all four would have C, D, G, and S.

Wait, but the problem states that the number of residents with exactly two is 437, exactly three is 234, and we need to find those with all four.

So, but the problem also gives the counts for D, G, S.

Wait, perhaps using the inclusion-exclusion formula for three sets (since C is universal) and considering the overlaps.

Wait, maybe it's better to think in terms of the Venn diagram. Let me denote:

Let’s denote:

a = number of people with only D.

b = number with only G.

c = number with only S.

d = number with only D and G.

e = number with only D and S.

f = number with only G and S.

g = number with D, G, and S (which is the same as all four, since everyone has C).

h = number with only C. So, these are people who don't have D, G, or S.

But the problem doesn't mention people who have only C. Wait, but the problem says that each resident has at least a bag of candy hearts, but they can have zero, one, two, etc., of the others.

But the problem gives the number of people with exactly two things (which are C plus one other?), wait no: exactly two of the four.

Wait, no. Exactly two of the four would include C plus one other item. Because C is one of the four.

Wait, let me clarify:

Each resident has C, but can have 0, 1, 2, or 3 of D, G, S.

So, the possible cases are:

- Only C: 0 of D, G, S.

- C and one of D, G, S: exactly two items (C plus one).

- C and two of D, G, S: exactly three items (C plus two).

- C and all three D, G, S: exactly four items, but wait, no, exactly four would be all four. Wait, no, because the four items are C, D, G, S. So, if someone has all four, that's four items, but in the problem statement, the maximum is four.

Wait, but the problem says 437 have exactly two, 234 have exactly three.

Wait, wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding. The problem says, "there are 437 residents who own exactly two of these things, and 234 residents who own exactly three of these things."

So, "these things" refers to the four: C, D, G, S.

So, exactly two of the four, and exactly three of the four.

So, let me model this:

Each resident has C, so to have exactly two, they must have C plus exactly one of D, G, S. Because C counts as one.

Similarly, to have exactly three, they must have C plus exactly two of D, G, S.

And to have exactly four, they have all four, which is C plus D, G, S.

So, the counts are as follows:

- Exactly two: C plus one of D, G, S. So, the number of such people is 437.

- Exactly three: C plus two of D, G, S. So, 234.

- All four: C plus D, G, S. Let's call this x.

- Only C: the remaining residents.

Wait, but we don't know the number of people who have only C. Let me denote that as y. So, the total residents would be:

y (only C) + (a + b + c) [C plus one of D, G, S] + (d + e + f) [C plus two of D, G, S] + g [C plus all three D, G, S] = 900.

Wait, but this seems complicated. Alternatively, perhaps it's better to model it in terms of the inclusion-exclusion principle for three sets D, G, S, considering that everyone has C.

Because, the counts for exactly two and exactly three of the four items would correspond to exactly one and exactly two of D, G, S, respectively.

Wait, let me think again.

If someone has exactly two of the four items (C, D, G, S), that means they have C plus exactly one of D, G, S.

Similarly, exactly three of the four items would mean they have C plus exactly two of D, G, S.

So, the number of people with exactly one of D, G, S is 437 (since they have C plus that one, making exactly two items).

Similarly, the number of people with exactly two of D, G, S is 234 (since they have C plus those two, making exactly three items).

And the number of people with all three of D, G, S is x (since they have C plus all three, making four items).

So, now, we can model the counts for D, G, S as:

The total number of people owning D is |D| = 195. This includes:

- People who have only D and C: a.

- People who have D and G and C: d.

- People who have D and S and C: e.

- People who have all three D, G, S and C: x.

Similarly for G and S.

So, |D| = a + d + e + x = 195.

Similarly,

|G| = b + d + f + x = 367.

|S| = c + e + f + x = 562.

Now, the number of people with exactly one of D, G, S is a + b + c = 437.

The number with exactly two of D, G, S is d + e + f = 234.

And the number with all three is x.

So, the total number of residents is:

y (only C) + (a + b + c) [exactly two items] + (d + e + f) [exactly three items] + x [all four] = y + 437 + 234 + x = y + x + 671 = 900.

So, y + x = 900 - 671 = 229.

But I don't know y yet.

But perhaps using the inclusion-exclusion formula for D, G, S:

|D ∪ G ∪ S| = |D| + |G| + |S| - |D∩G| - |D∩S| - |G∩S| + |D∩G∩S|

But |D ∪ G ∪ S| is the number of people who have at least one of D, G, S, which is equal to (900 - y). Because y is the number who have only C.

So,

|D ∪ G ∪ S| = 900 - y.

Now, |D| = 195, |G|=367, |S|=562.

|D∩G| is the number of people who have both D and G, which is d + x.

Similarly, |D∩S| is e + x.

|G∩S| is f + x.

And |D∩G∩S| is x.

So, substituting into the inclusion-exclusion formula:

900 - y = (195) + (367) + (562) - (d + x) - (e + x) - (f + x) + x.

Let me compute the sum:

195 + 367 = 562 + 562? Wait, 195 + 367 is 562, then +562 is 1124.

So,

900 - y = 1124 - (d + x + e + x + f + x) + x.

Simplify the terms:

The sum inside the subtraction is d + e + f + 3x.

So,

900 - y = 1124 - (d + e + f + 3x) + x.

Which simplifies to:

900 - y = 1124 - (d + e + f) - 2x.

But from earlier, we know that d + e + f = 234 (the number of people with exactly two of D, G, S).

So, substitute that in:

900 - y = 1124 - 234 - 2x.

Calculate 1124 - 234: 1124 - 200 = 924; 924 - 34 = 890.

So,

900 - y = 890 - 2x.

Rearrange:

- y = 890 - 2x - 900.

Which is,

- y = -10 - 2x.

Multiply both sides by -1:

y = 10 + 2x.

Earlier, we had that y + x = 229.

So,

(10 + 2x) + x = 229.

Which is,

10 + 3x = 229.

Subtract 10:

3x = 219.

Divide by 3:

x = 73.

So, the number of residents who own all four things is 73.


To solve the problem, we apply the principle of inclusion-exclusion and analyze the given data systematically.

1. **Define Variables**:
   - Let \( x \) be the number of residents who own all four items (C, D, G, S).
   - Let \( a, b, c \) be the number of residents owning exactly one of D, G, S along with C.
   - Let \( d, e, f \) be the number of residents owning exactly two of D, G, S along with C.
   - Let \( y \) be the number of residents who own only C.

2. **Given Data**:
   - Total residents: \( 900 \).
   - Residents owning exactly two items: \( 437 \) (which translates to \( d + e + f = 437 \)).
   - Residents owning exactly three items: \( 234 \) (which translates to \( a + b + c = 234 \)).
   - Ownership counts:
     - \( |D| = 195 = a + d + e + x \),
     - \( |G| = 367 = b + d + f + x \),
     - \( |S| = 562 = c + e + f + x \).

3. **Inclusion-Exclusion Principle**:
   - The union of D, G, S is \( |D \cup G \cup S| = 900 - y \).
   - Applying inclusion-exclusion:
     \[
     |D \cup G \cup S| = |D| + |G| + |S| - |D \cap G| - |D \cap S| - |G \cap S| + |D \cap G \cap S|
     \]
   - Substituting the values:
     \[
     900 - y = 195 + 367 + 562 - (d + x) - (e + x) - (f + x) + x
     \]
   - Simplify:
     \[
     900 - y = 1124 - (d + e + f) - 2x
     \]
   - Substitute \( d + e + f = 234 \):
     \[
     900 - y = 1124 - 234 - 2x \implies 900 - y = 890 - 2x
     \]
   - Rearranging:
     \[
     y = 10 + 2x
     \]

4. **Total Residents**:
   - The total number of residents is:
     \[
     y + (a + b + c) + (d + e + f) + x = 900
     \]
   - Substitute \( a + b + c = 234 \) and \( d + e + f = 437 \):
     \[
     y + 234 + 437 + x = 900 \implies y + x = 229
     \]
   - Substitute \( y = 10 + 2x \):
     \[
     10 + 2x + x = 229 \implies 3x = 219 \implies x = 73
     \]

5. **Conclusion**:
   - The number of residents who own all four items is \( \boxed{73} \).
