Okay, so I've got this geometry problem here about a tetrahedron. Hmm, a tetrahedron is like a 3D shape with four triangular faces, right? The problem gives me the lengths of all the edges opposite each other: AB and CD are both sqrt(41), AC and BD are sqrt(80), and BC and AD are sqrt(89). Interesting, so each pair of opposite edges is equal. I think that might mean the tetrahedron is symmetrical in some way.

The question is asking about a point I inside the tetrahedron where the distances from I to each of the four faces are all equal. I've heard of such a point before—it's called the incenter, similar to the incenter of a triangle, which is the center of the inscribed circle. In a tetrahedron, the incenter is the center of the inscribed sphere (inradius). So, the distance from I to each face is the inradius, and we need to find that.

The problem says this distance can be written as m√n / p, with m, n, p positive integers, m and p coprime, and n square-free. Then, we need to find m + n + p.

Alright, so how do I find the inradius of a tetrahedron? I remember that in a tetrahedron, the inradius can be found using the formula:

r = 3V / S

where V is the volume of the tetrahedron and S is the total surface area (the sum of the areas of all four faces). So, I need to compute both the volume V and the surface area S.

But wait, computing the volume of a tetrahedron when only edge lengths are given can be tricky. I think I need to use coordinates or maybe some formula related to the edge lengths. Alternatively, since all opposite edges are equal, maybe the tetrahedron is isohedral or something, which might make things easier.

Wait, let me think about the coordinates approach. If I can assign coordinates to the four vertices such that all the given edge lengths are satisfied, then I can compute the volume using the scalar triple product. That might work, but it could be a bit involved. Alternatively, maybe there's a formula for volume when opposite edges are equal.

Alternatively, I remember that for a tetrahedron with opposite edges equal (AB=CD, AC=BD, AD=BC), it's called a "equifacial" tetrahedron or maybe a "isosceles" tetrahedron. I think such a tetrahedron has some properties that can simplify calculations.

Wait, perhaps it's a disphenoid. A disphenoid is a tetrahedron where opposite edges are equal, and it's known that all faces are congruent triangles. But in this case, the edges are sqrt(41), sqrt(80), sqrt(89). Wait, let me check: the faces—each face is a triangle with edges from the given set. Wait, each face must be a triangle formed by three edges. Let me see:

Each face is a triangle with sides from the given edge lengths. Let's see, for example, face ABC
