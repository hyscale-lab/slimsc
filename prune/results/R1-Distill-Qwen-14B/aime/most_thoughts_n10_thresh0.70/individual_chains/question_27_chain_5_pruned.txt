Okay, so I've got this problem about a torus and a sphere. Let me try to visualize it first. A torus is like a donut shape, right? It's created by rotating a circle around an axis that's in the same plane as the circle but doesn't pass through its center. In this case, the circle has a radius of 3, and the distance from the center of the circle to the axis of rotation is 6. So, the torus is formed by spinning this circle around that axis.

Now, there's a sphere with radius 11. The torus can rest either inside or outside of this sphere. When it's inside, it's tangent to the sphere along a circle with radius r_i, and when it's outside, it's tangent along another circle with radius r_o. The question asks for the difference r_i - r_o, expressed as a fraction m/n where m and n are coprime, and then to find m + n.

Hmm, okay, so I need to find these two radii r_i and r_o where the torus is tangent to the sphere in both internal and external configurations.

First, maybe I should recall the standard equations or properties of a torus. The torus can be described using two radii: R, the distance from the center of the generating circle to the axis of rotation, and r, the radius of the generating circle itself. In this problem, R is 6 and r is 3.

When dealing with a torus and a sphere tangent to it, I think the key is to find the points where the two surfaces touch. For internal tangency, the torus is entirely inside the sphere, touching along a circle. Similarly, for external tangency, the torus is outside the sphere, touching along a circle.

I remember that for a sphere and a torus, the tangent points lie along a circle, and the radius of that circle can be found using some geometric relationships.

Let me try to model this. Let's consider the sphere first. The sphere has a radius of 11, so its center is at some point, say the origin (0,0,0) in 3D space for simplicity.

When the torus is inside the sphere and tangent to it, their surfaces touch at exactly one point? Or along a circle. Wait, no, for a sphere and a torus, the intersection can be more complicated. But in this case, the problem states that they are tangent along a circle, so it's a single circle where they touch.

Similarly, when the torus is outside, they're tangent along another circle.

I think the key here is to find the distance from the sphere's center to the torus's center, and then relate that to the radii r_i and r_o.

Wait, the torus's center is the center of the generating circle. Since the torus is formed by rotating a circle of radius 3 around an axis 6 units away, the center of the generating circle is at a distance of 6 from the axis. So, the "center" of the torus is not a single point but a circle itself, but perhaps we can model the center of the torus as being at a distance of 6 from the sphere's center.

But wait, the sphere is fixed, and the torus is placed either inside or outside. So, perhaps the sphere's center and the torus's "center" (the center of the generating circle) are aligned along the same axis, which would be the axis of rotation for the torus.

Let me try to sketch this mentally. The sphere is centered at the origin. The torus is generated by rotating a circle of radius 3 around an axis that's 6 units away from the center of that circle. So, the center of the generating circle is 6 units from the axis, which itself is along, say, the z-axis. So, the generating circle is in the plane perpendicular to the z-axis, 6 units away from it.

Wait, perhaps
