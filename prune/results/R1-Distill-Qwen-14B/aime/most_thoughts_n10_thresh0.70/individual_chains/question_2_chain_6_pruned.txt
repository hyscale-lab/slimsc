Okay, so I have this problem here with points O, A, and B. O is at (0,0), A is at (1/2, 0), and B is at (0, sqrt(3)/2). They form a triangle, I think. The family F consists of segments PQ of unit length in the first quadrant, with P on the x-axis and Q on the y-axis. So these are like line segments from somewhere on the x-axis to somewhere on the y-axis, each exactly length 1. 

The question is about a point C on segment AB, not being A or B, that isn't on any of these PQ segments except for AB itself. And then we need to find OC squared, express it as a reduced fraction p/q, and then find p+q.

First, I need to visualize this. Points O, A, and B. O is the origin, A is halfway between O and (1,0), and B is somewhere up the y-axis, maybe a bit less than (0,1) since sqrt(3)/2 is about 0.866.

Segment AB connects A(1/2, 0) to B(0, sqrt(3)/2). So AB is a line segment in the first quadrant. The family F consists of these unit-length segments PQ from the x-axis to y-axis. So each PQ is a line from (p,0) to (0,q), with sqrt(p^2 + q^2) = 1. So p and q are positive numbers such that p^2 + q^2 = 1.

Now, for any such PQ, it's a line segment in the first quadrant with endpoints on the axes, length 1. So the equation of such a segment can be described as a line from (p,0) to (0,q), where p^2 + q^2 = 1. The equation of the line PQ would be x/p + y/q = 1.

So, the family F consists of all such lines where p and q are positive, p^2 + q^2 =1.

Now, the problem says that point C is on AB, different from A and B, and it's the only point on AB that's not on any other segment from F except AB itself. So, AB is one of these segments. Wait, is AB in the family F?

Let's check. AB is from (1/2, 0) to (0, sqrt(3)/2). So p is 1/2, q is sqrt(3)/2. Then p^2 + q^2 = (1/4) + (3/4) = 1. So yes, AB is indeed in the family F.

So, AB is one of these segments. But the point C is on AB, but not on any other segment from F. So, C is a point on AB that is not covered by any other PQ from F except for AB itself.

So, the question is to find such a point C on AB, and then compute OC².

So, to solve this, I think we need to find the point C on AB such that it doesn't lie on any other PQ in F except AB.

To approach this, perhaps we can parametrize AB and then find the point C where, for all other PQ in F, the point C is not on PQ.

Alternatively, maybe the point C is where the envelope of all these PQ lines is tangent to AB.

Wait, envelope... I remember that the envelope of a family of curves is a curve that is tangent to each member of the family at some point. So, if we can find the envelope of the family F, then the point C might be the point where this envelope touches AB.

So, perhaps the envelope of F is some curve, and the point C is the intersection point of this envelope and AB.

Alternatively, maybe we can find the condition that a point (x, y) lies on AB and also lies on some PQ from F, and then find when this has a unique solution, which would be the point C.

Let me try to parametrize AB.

First, let's find the equation of AB.

Points A(1/2, 0) and B(0, sqrt(3)/2). The slope of AB is (sqrt(3)/2 - 0)/(0 - 1/2) = (sqrt(3)/2)/(-1/2) = -sqrt(3).

So, the equation of AB is y = -sqrt(3)(x - 1/2). Because it passes through (1/2, 0) with slope -sqrt(3).

Simplify: y = -sqrt(3)x + sqrt(3)/2.

So, any point C on AB can be written as (x, -sqrt(3)x + sqrt(3)/2), where x is between 0 and 1/2.

Now, for a point (x,y) to lie on AB and also on some PQ from F, it must satisfy both the equation of AB and the equation of some PQ.

The equation of PQ is x/p + y/q = 1, where p^2 + q^2 = 1.

So, substituting y from AB into the equation of PQ:

x/p + (-sqrt(3)x + sqrt(3)/2)/q = 1.

Let me denote this as:

x (1/p - sqrt(3)/q) + (sqrt(3)/(2q)) = 1.

But also, since p^2 + q^2 = 1, we can write q = sqrt(1 - p^2). Hmm, but that might complicate things because of the square root.

Alternatively, perhaps we can express this in terms of a parameter. Let me consider parameterizing p and q such that p = cos(theta) and q = sin(theta), since p^2 + q^2 = 1. So, theta is an angle parameter.

So, p = cos(theta), q = sin(theta), where theta is between 0 and pi/2 because p and q are positive.

So, the equation of PQ becomes x/cos(theta) + y/sin(theta) = 1.

Now, the point C is on both AB and PQ. So, substituting y from AB into this equation:

x/cos(theta) + (-sqrt(3)x + sqrt(3)/2)/sin(theta) = 1.

Let me write this as:

x * (1/cos(theta) - sqrt(3)/sin(theta)) + (sqrt(3)/2) / sin(theta) = 1.

Let me denote this as:

x * [ (sin(theta) - sqrt(3) cos(theta)) / (cos(theta) sin(theta)) ) ] + (sqrt(3)/(2 sin(theta))) = 1

Wait, let me see:

Let me compute 1/cos(theta) - sqrt(3)/sin(theta).

This is equal to (sin(theta) - sqrt(3) cos(theta)) / (cos(theta) sin(theta)).

So, the equation becomes:

x * [ (sin(theta) - sqrt(3) cos(theta)) / (cos(theta) sin(theta)) ] + sqrt(3)/(2 sin(theta)) = 1.

Let me denote this as:

x [ (sin(theta) - sqrt(3) cos(theta)) / (cos(theta) sin(theta)) ] = 1 - sqrt(3)/(2 sin(theta)).

Let me solve for x:

x = [ 1 - sqrt(3)/(2 sin(theta)) ] / [ (sin(theta) - sqrt(3) cos(theta)) / (cos(theta) sin(theta)) ]

Simplify numerator and denominator.

First, numerator: 1 - sqrt(3)/(2 sin(theta)) = [ 2 sin(theta) - sqrt(3) ] / (2 sin(theta)).

Denominator: [ (sin(theta) - sqrt(3) cos(theta)) / (cos(theta) sin(theta)) ]

So, x becomes:

[ (2 sin(theta) - sqrt(3)) / (2 sin(theta)) ] / [ (sin(theta) - sqrt(3) cos(theta)) / (cos(theta) sin(theta)) ]

Which is equal to:

[ (2 sin(theta) - sqrt(3)) / (2 sin(theta)) ] * [ cos(theta) sin(theta) / (sin(theta) - sqrt(3) cos(theta)) ]

Simplify:

The sin(theta) terms cancel out:

[ (2 sin(theta) - sqrt(3)) / 2 ] * [ cos(theta) / (sin(theta) - sqrt(3) cos(theta)) ]

Let me factor numerator and denominator.

Notice that the denominator is (sin(theta) - sqrt(3) cos(theta)).

The numerator inside the brackets is (2 sin(theta) - sqrt(3)).

Wait, perhaps we can factor sqrt(3) out.

Wait, let me write 2 sin(theta) - sqrt(3) as 2 sin(theta) - sqrt(3). Let's see if this relates to the denominator.

Wait, denominator: sin(theta) - sqrt(3) cos(theta). Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps we can factor out a 2 from the numerator.

But maybe instead, let's see if the numerator and denominator have a common factor.

Let me write the denominator as sin(theta) - sqrt(3) cos(theta).

And the numerator is 2 sin(theta) - sqrt(3). Hmm, not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps we can write the denominator as 2 times (sin(theta)/2 - (sqrt(3)/2) cos(theta)).

Wait, sin(theta)/2 - (sqrt(3)/2) cos(theta) is equal to sin(theta - 60 degrees), since cos(60) = 1/2, sin(60) = sqrt(3)/2. So, sin(theta - 60°) = sin(theta) cos(60°) - cos(theta) sin(60°) = sin(theta)(1/2) - cos(theta)(sqrt(3)/2) = (sin(theta) - sqrt(3) cos(theta))/2.

Wait, so the denominator is 2 sin(theta - 60°). Because:

sin(theta - 60°) = [sin(theta) cos(60°) - cos(theta) sin(60°)] = (sin(theta) * 0.5 - cos(theta) * (sqrt(3)/2)).

So, 2 sin(theta - 60°) = sin(theta) - sqrt(3) cos(theta). Which is exactly our denominator.

So, denominator is 2 sin(theta - 60°).

Similarly, the numerator is 2 sin(theta) - sqrt(3).

Let me see: 2 sin(theta) - sqrt(3) = 2 sin(theta) - 2 * (sqrt(3)/2) = 2 [ sin(theta) - sqrt(3)/2 ].

Hmm, sqrt(3)/2 is sin(60°). So, 2 sin(theta) - sqrt(3) = 2 [ sin(theta) - sin(60°) ].

And, using the identity: sin(A) - sin(B) = 2 cos( (A+B)/2 ) sin( (A - B)/2 ).

So, sin(theta) - sin(60°) = 2 cos( (theta + 60°)/2 ) sin( (theta - 60°)/2 ).

Therefore, 2 [ sin(theta) - sin(60°) ] = 4 cos( (theta + 60°)/2 ) sin( (theta - 60°)/2 ).

Hmm, maybe this is getting too involved, but perhaps there's a better way.

Wait, let me go back to x:

x = [ (2 sin(theta) - sqrt(3)) / 2 ] * [ cos(theta) / (sin(theta) -
