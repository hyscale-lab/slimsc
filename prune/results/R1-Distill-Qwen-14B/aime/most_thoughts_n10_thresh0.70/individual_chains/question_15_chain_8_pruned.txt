Okay, so I've got this problem here about counting the number of paths on an 8x8 grid that change direction exactly four times. The paths start from the lower left corner and go to the upper right corner, and each path has a length of 16. Hmm, let me try to visualize this.

First, I remember that in a grid, moving from the lower left to the upper right corner usually involves moving right and up. For an 8x8 grid, you have to move 8 steps right and 8 steps up, totaling 16 steps. So each path is a combination of these moves. Now, without any restrictions, the number of such paths is given by the binomial coefficient C(16,8) since we're choosing 8 steps out of 16 to be right (or up, doesn't matter which). But this problem is different because it imposes a restriction on the number of direction changes.

What's a direction change? Well, a direction change happens when the path switches from moving right to up or from up to right. So, for example, if a path goes right, right, up, up, right, right, etc., each time it switches from right to up or vice versa, that's a direction change. 

The problem asks for paths that change direction exactly four times. So, I need to figure out how many such paths exist. Let me think about how direction changes relate to the structure of the path.

If a path starts by moving right, then to have four direction changes, it must switch to up, then back to right, then up, then right, and so on. Each time we make a direction change, we're switching between right and up. So, the number of direction changes is related to the number of times we switch between these two directions.

Wait, how does the number of direction changes relate to the number of segments in the path? Each time the path changes direction, it starts a new segment. So, if we have four direction changes, that means the path is composed of five segments. Let me explain: starting with the first segment, then each direction change adds another segment. So, four changes mean five segments in total.

Each segment is a consecutive sequence of right or up moves. Since the path must start at the lower left and end at the upper right, the first segment must be right, the last segment must be up, and the segments alternate between right and up in between. So, if the number of direction changes is four, the path will have five segments, alternating between right and up.

Since the grid is 8x8, the total number of right moves is 8 and the total number of up moves is also 8. So, the sum of the lengths of the right segments must be 8, and the sum of the lengths of the up segments must also be 8.

Each of the five segments must consist of at least one step, right? Because you can't have a segment of length zero; that would mean not moving at all, but we have to reach the end. So, the problem reduces to partitioning 8 right steps into 3 right segments (since there are five segments in total, alternating right and up; starting with right, then up, then right, up, right, up, right? Wait, wait. Wait, five segments with four direction changes. Let me make sure.

Starting direction: right. Then after four direction changes, the fifth segment is up. So, number of right segments is three? No, wait:

Wait, if we have four direction changes, that would create five segments. Let's see:

Segment 1: right
Segment 2: up (direction change 1)
Segment 3: right (direction change 2)
Segment 4: up (direction change 3)
Segment 5: right (direction change 4)

Wait, that's four direction changes, starting with right. But the last segment is right. But we need to end at the upper right corner, which requires the last segment to be up. Hmm, that's a problem. So, perhaps the starting direction is right, then up, then right, then up, then right, then up. Wait, no, that would be five direction changes. Hmm, maybe I need to re-examine this.

Wait, perhaps the number of direction changes is four, so the number of segments is five. The starting segment is right, then up, then right, then up, then right. That's four direction changes and five segments. But the last segment is right, which would mean we end on the right side, but we need to end at the upper right corner, which requires the last segment to be up. So, something's wrong here.

Wait, maybe the starting direction can be either right or up. But in an 8x8 grid, to go from lower left to upper right, the starting and ending directions have to be right and up respectively. Because if you start with up, you'd be moving up first, but you still
