Okay, so I've got this problem about placing chips on a 5x5 grid. There are 25 white chips and 25 black chips, but I can only place some of them on the grid. The conditions are that each cell can have at most one chip. Also, all chips in the same row must be the same color, and all chips in the same column must be the same color. Plus, any additional chip would violate these conditions. Hmm, interesting.

Let me try to break this down. First, each row can have either all white chips or all black chips, but only some of them. Wait, no. Wait, the condition is that all chips in the same row have the same color, but it doesn't say that the row must be completely filled. So, a row can have some white chips and some black chips, but all the chips in that row must be the same color. Wait, no, that doesn't make sense. If a row has some white and some black, then the chips in that row aren't all the same color. So, each row must be entirely white or entirely black, but you can choose how many chips to put in each row.

Wait, but wait again. No, that's not right. Because if a row has, say, 2 white chips and 3 black chips, then the chips in that row aren't all the same color. So, that's not allowed. So, each row must have either all white chips or all black chips, but you can choose which. And same for each column. Each column must have all the same color.

Wait, but the problem says "all chips in the same row and all chips in the same column have the same colour". So, each row must be monochromatic, and each column must be monochromatic. So, it's like each row and each column is uniformly colored.

But then, how does that work? Because the grid is 5x5, each row can be either white or black. Similarly, each column can be either white or black. But wait, because the intersection of a row and a column must agree on the color. For example, if a row is white, then every cell in that row must have a white chip, but each column in that row must also be white. Hmm, no, not necessarily. Wait, because a column can have all its cells in that column as white or black. So, the color of a
