Okay, so I have this logarithm problem here. Let me try to parse it step by step. The problem says:

There exist real numbers \( x \) and \( y \), both greater than 1, such that
\[
\log_x(y^x) = \log_y(x^{4y}) = 10
\]
We need to find \( xy \).

Alright, so both logarithmic expressions equal 10. Let me write that down:

1. \( \log_x(y^x) = 10 \)
2. \( \log_y(x^{4y}) = 10 \)

I remember some logarithm properties. Let me recall. The logarithm \( \log_b(a) = c \) means that \( b^c = a \). Also, \( \log_b(a^k) = k \log_b(a) \).

So, starting with the first equation:

\( \log_x(y^x) = 10 \)

Using the power rule, this becomes:

\( x \cdot \log_x(y) = 10 \)

Which simplifies to:

\( \log_x(y) = 10 / x \)

Hmm. Alternatively, I can express this in exponential form. Since \( \log_x(y) = 10/x \), that implies:

\( x^{10/x} = y \)

So, \( y \) is expressed in terms of \( x \). Let me note that down:

\( y = x^{10/x} \)  ... (1)

Now, moving on to the second equation:

\( \log_y(x^{4y}) = 10 \)

Again, apply the power rule:

\( 4y \cdot \log_y(x) = 10 \)

So,

\( \log_y(x) = 10 / (4y) = 5 / (2y) \)

Expressing this in exponential form:

\( y^{5/(2y)} = x \) ... (2)

So now I have two equations:

From (1): \( y = x^{10/x} \)

From (2): \( x = y^{5/(2y)} \)

Hmm, so equation (1) gives \( y \) in terms of \( x \), and equation (2) gives \( x \) in terms of \( y \). Maybe I can substitute one into the other.

Let me substitute equation (1) into equation (2). So, since \( y = x^{10/x} \), substitute that into equation (2):

\( x = (x^{10/x})^{5/(2y)} \)

Wait, but that still has \( y \) in the exponent. Hmm, perhaps I can express everything in terms of \( x \) only.

Wait, but since \( y = x^{10/x} \), maybe I can substitute \( y \) in terms of \( x \) into the equation \( x = y^{5/(2y)} \).

Let me try that:

\( x = (y)^{5/(2y)} \)

But \( y = x^{10/x} \), so substituting:

\( x = \left( x^{10/x} \right)^{5/(2y)} \)

Wait, but \( y \) is already \( x^{10/x} \), so we can write \( y = x^{10/x} \). Therefore, \( 1/y = x^{-10/x} \).

Wait, maybe it's getting a bit messy. Let me see if I can express equation (2) in terms of \( x \) only.

From equation (2):

\( x = y^{5/(2y)} \)

Take the natural logarithm of both sides to make it easier to handle exponents.

\( \ln x = \frac{5}{2y} \cdot \ln y \)

But from equation (1), \( y = x^{10/x} \), so \( \ln
