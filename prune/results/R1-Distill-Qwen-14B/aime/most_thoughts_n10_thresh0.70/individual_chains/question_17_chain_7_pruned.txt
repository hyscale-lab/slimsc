Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the radius squared of the smallest sphere that can contain any rectangular box from the set B. The set B consists of boxes with a surface area of 54 and a volume of 23. Then, I have to express r squared as a fraction p/q, where p and q are coprime, and find p+q.

Alright, let me break this down. First, the rectangular box has length, width, and height. Let's denote them as x, y, z. The surface area of a rectangular box is given by 2(xy + yz + zx) = 54, and the volume is xyz = 23.

So, we have two equations:

1. 2(xy + yz + zx) = 54 → which simplifies to xy + yz + zx = 27.
2. xyz = 23.

We need to find the smallest sphere that can contain the box. The sphere must encompass the entire box, so the diameter of the sphere must be at least the space diagonal of the box. The space diagonal d of a box with sides x, y, z is given by sqrt(x² + y² + z²). Therefore, the radius r of the sphere would be half of that, so r = d/2 = (sqrt(x² + y² + z²))/2. Therefore, r² = (x² + y² + z²)/4.

So, our goal is to find the minimal r². Which is equivalent to finding the minimal value of (x² + y² + z²)/4, given the constraints on the surface area and volume.

So, I need to minimize x² + y² + z², given that xy + yz + zx = 27 and xyz = 23.

Hmm, this sounds like a problem that can be approached using Lagrange multipliers or perhaps some inequalities like AM ≥ GM or other optimization techniques. But since it's a box, the symmetry might help.

Wait, but since the box isn't necessarily a cube, we might not have symmetry. So perhaps I can use the method of Lagrange multipliers with two constraints.

Alternatively, I can try to express variables in terms of each other.

Let me think about whether I can express one variable in terms of the others.

From the volume equation, xyz = 23, so z = 23/(xy).

Plugging that into the surface area equation:

xy + y*(23/(xy)) + x*(23/(xy)) = 27.

Wait, let me compute that.

Wait, z = 23/(xy), so yz = y*(23/(xy)) = 23/x, and xz = x*(23/(xy)) = 23/y.

So, substituting into the surface area equation:

xy + yz + zx = xy + (23/x) + (23/y) = 27.

So, we have:

xy + (23/x) + (23/y) = 27.

Hmm, this seems a bit complicated, but maybe we can let u = x + y and v = xy, but not sure.

Alternatively, maybe we can set x = y for simplicity? Wait, but since the problem is symmetric, perhaps the minimal sphere occurs when x = y. Let me test that.

Assume x = y. Then, let’s let x = y. Then, from the volume equation, x*x*z = 23 → z = 23/(x²).

From the surface area equation, xy + yz + zx = x² + 2x z = 27.

Substituting z = 23/(x²), we get:

x² + 2x*(23/(x²)) = 27 → x² + (46)/(x) = 27.

Multiply both sides by x to eliminate the denominator:

x³ + 46 = 27x → x³ -27x +46=0.

Hmm, let me try to solve this cubic equation x³ -27x +46=0.

Maybe I can factor it. Let's try possible integer roots. The possible rational roots are factors of 46 over 1, i.e., ±1, ±2, ±23, ±46.

Testing x=1: 1 -27 +46=20≠0.

x=2:8 -54 +46=0. Hey, x=2 is a root.

So, (x-2) is a factor. Let's perform polynomial division or factor it.

Divide x³ -27x +46 by (x-2):

Using synthetic division:

2 | 1  0  -27  46

          2   4  -46

      1  2  -23  0

So, the cubic factors as (x-2)(x² +2x -23)=0.

So, the other roots are solutions to x² +2x -23=0.

Using quadratic formula:

x = [-2 ± sqrt(4 +92)]/2 = [-2 ± sqrt(96)]/2 = [-2 ± 4*sqrt(6)]/2 = -1 ± 2√6.

But since x is a length, it must be positive. So, x=2 or x=-1 +2√6. Let me compute -1 +2√6: √6≈2.45, so 2*2.45≈4.90. So, 4.90-1≈3.90. Positive. So x=2 or x≈3.90.

But wait, when x=2, then z=23/(2²)=23/4=5.75.

So, the box would be 2x2x5.75.

But wait, let's compute x² + y² + z². Since x=y=2, z=5.75.

x² + y² + z² = 4 +4 + (23/4)^2 = 8 + (529/16) = (128/16)+(529/16)=657/16≈41.0625.

If x≈3.90, then x≈3.90, y≈3.90, and z=23/(3.90²). Let me compute z.

3.90²≈15.21, so z≈23/15.21≈1.511.

Then, x² + y² + z²≈ 3.90²*2 + (1.511)^2 ≈15.21*2 + 2.28≈30.42 +2.28≈32.7.

Wait, that's a much smaller sum. So, that would give a smaller radius squared. Hmm, but is this the minimal?

Wait, but perhaps assuming x=y is not the optimal. Because maybe when x and y are different,
