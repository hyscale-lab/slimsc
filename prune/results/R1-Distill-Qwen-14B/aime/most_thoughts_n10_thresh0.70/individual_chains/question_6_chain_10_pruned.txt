Okay, so I'm trying to solve this problem where I have two functions: y = 4 g(f(sin(2πx))) and x = 4 g(f(cos(3πy))). I need to find how many times their graphs intersect. That means I need to find the number of solutions (x, y) that satisfy both equations simultaneously.

First, let me understand the functions f and g. They are defined as f(x) = | |x| - 1/2 | and g(x) = | |x| - 1/4 |. Hmm, these look like absolute value functions that have been transformed. Maybe I should graph these to see what they look like.

Starting with f(x) = | |x| - 1/2 |. Let me think about the inner function |x|. That's a V-shape graph with the vertex at (0,0). Then subtract 1/2: |x| - 1/2. This would shift the graph down by 1/2. But then take the absolute value of that: so f(x) is the absolute value of |x| - 1/2. That means wherever |x| - 1/2 is negative, we flip it to positive.

So, |x| - 1/2 is negative when |x| < 1/2. So for |x| < 1/2, f(x) becomes -( |x| - 1/2 ) = 1/2 - |x|. For |x| >= 1/2, f(x) is just |x| - 1/2.

So the graph of f(x) would look like a V with its vertex at (0, 1/2), going down to (1/2, 0) and then up again. Wait, actually, when |x| is 0, f(x) is 1/2. When |x| is 1/2, f(x) is 0. Then as |x| increases beyond 1/2, f(x) increases again. So f(x) is a W shape? Or maybe a V with a flat bottom? Wait, no, it's a V that's been shifted and reflected.

Wait, maybe it's better to split into cases:

Case 1: x >= 0.

Then f(x) = |x - 1/2| if x >= 0.

Wait, no. Wait f(x) = ||x| - 1/2|. So for x >=0, it's |x - 1/2|. So for x >= 0:

If x >= 1/2, then f(x) = x - 1/2.

If x < 1/2, then f(x) = 1/2 - x.

Similarly, for x < 0, since |x| = -x, so f(x) = | -x - 1/2 | = |x + 1/2|.

So f(x) is a V-shaped graph with the minimum at x = 1/2 and x = -1/2? Wait, no. Because for x >=0, it's V with vertex at (1/2,
