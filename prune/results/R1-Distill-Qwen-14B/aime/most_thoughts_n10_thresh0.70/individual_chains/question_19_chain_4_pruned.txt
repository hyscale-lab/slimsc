Okay, so I have this geometry problem here. Let me read it again and try to understand what's given and what's being asked.

We have triangle ABC with circumcenter O and incenter I. It's given that IA is perpendicular to OI. The circumradius is 13, and the inradius is 6. We need to find the product AB multiplied by AC, which is AB · AC.

Hmm, okay. So, I remember that the circumradius R is related to the sides of the triangle, and the inradius r is also related. But I'm not exactly sure how IA being perpendicular to OI ties into this. Let me think.

First, let's recall some formulas. The circumradius R of a triangle is given by R = (a*b*c)/(4*Δ), where a, b, c are the sides and Δ is the area. The inradius r is given by r = Δ/s, where s is the semi-perimeter, s = (a + b + c)/2.

Wait, but the problem gives R = 13 and r = 6. So maybe I can find some relationship between the sides using these.

But there's also this condition that IA is perpendicular to OI. I'm not sure how to approach that. Maybe I can draw a diagram to visualize it. Let me imagine triangle ABC with O as the circumcenter and I as the incenter. IA is one of the angle bisectors, right? Since I is the incenter, IA bisects angle A.

And O is the circumcenter, so OA = OB = OC = 13. The inradius is 6, so the distance from I to each side is 6.

IA is perpendicular to OI. So, vector IA is perpendicular to vector OI. Hmm, maybe coordinate geometry can help here. Let me consider placing the triangle in a coordinate system to make things easier.

Let me assume that point A is at (0, 0), point B is at (c, 0), and point C is somewhere in the plane. Maybe I can assign coordinates to O and I. But I'm not sure if that's the best approach.

Alternatively, I remember that in triangle geometry, there are some relations involving the distance between the incenter and circumcenter. The formula for OI is sqrt(R(R - 2r)). Wait, is that correct? Let me check. Oh yes, the formula is OI² = R² - 2Rr. So OI = sqrt(R² - 2Rr).

Given R = 13 and r = 6, let's compute OI:

OI² = 13² - 2*13*6 = 169 - 156 = 13. So OI = sqrt(13). Okay, that's a useful piece of information.

So the distance between the incenter and the circumcenter is sqrt(13). Now, IA is perpendicular to OI. Hmm. So, in triangle AIO, IA is perpendicular to OI. So triangle AIO is a right-angled triangle at A.

Wait, no, IA is perpendicular to OI, but IA is a segment from I to A, and OI is a segment from O to I
