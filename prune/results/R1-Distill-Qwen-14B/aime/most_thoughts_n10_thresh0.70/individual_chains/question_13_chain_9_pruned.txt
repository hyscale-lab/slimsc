Okay, so I'm trying to solve this math problem about Aya's morning walks. Let me read it again and break it down.

Every morning, Aya goes for a 9-kilometer-long walk and stops at a coffee shop afterwards. When she walks at a constant speed of s kilometers per hour, the walk takes her 4 hours, including t minutes spent in the coffee shop. When she walks s+2 kilometers per hour, the walk takes her 2 hours and 24 minutes, including t minutes spent in the coffee shop. Now, we need to find how many minutes her walk takes her when she walks at s + 1/2 kilometers per hour, including the t minutes in the coffee shop.

Hmm, okay. So, the key here is to find s and t first, right? Because once we have those, we can calculate the time when she walks at s + 1/2 km/h.

Let me think. So, the distance is the same in both cases: 9 kilometers. The time includes both the walking time and the coffee shop time (t minutes). So, for the first scenario, at speed s, the total time is 4 hours, which includes t minutes.

Wait, but time is given in hours, and t is in minutes. I should probably convert everything to the same unit to make it easier. Let's convert everything into hours.

So, in the first case, the total time is 4 hours. The second case is 2 hours and 24 minutes. Let me convert 24 minutes to hours. Since 24 minutes is 24/60 hours, which is 0.4 hours. So, 2 hours and 24 minutes is 2.4 hours.

Now, when she walks at speed s, her walking time is 4 hours minus t (in hours). Similarly, when she walks at speed s+2, her walking time is 2.4 hours minus t (in hours). But wait, no. Wait, the total time is the walking time plus the coffee shop time. So, in the first case, the total time is 4 hours, which is walking time plus t minutes (which is t/60 hours). Similarly, in the second case, total time is 2.4 hours, which is walking time plus t/60 hours.

Let me write the equations.

For the first scenario:
Walking time = (9 km) / (s km/h) = 9/s hours.
Coffee shop time = t minutes = t/60 hours.
Total time = walking time + coffee shop time.
So, 9/s + t/60 = 4.

Similarly, for the second scenario:
Walking time = 9 / (s + 2) hours.
Coffee shop time = t/60 hours.
Total time = 9/(s+2) + t/60 = 2.4.

So now I have two equations:

1) 9/s + t/60 = 4
2) 9/(s+2) + t/60 = 2.4

Hmm, okay, so I can subtract the second equation from the first to eliminate t.

Subtracting equation 2 from equation 1:

(9/s - 9/(s+2)) + (t/60 - t/60) = 4 - 2.4

Simplify:

9/s - 9/(s+2) = 1.6

Let me compute 9/s - 9/(s+2):

= 9*( (s+2) - s ) / (s*(s+2)) )
= 9*(2) / (s*(s+2))
= 18 / (s^2 + 2s)

So, 18 / (s^2 + 2s) = 1.6

Let me write that as:

18 = 1.6*(s^2 + 2s)

Compute 1.6 times (s^2 + 2s):

1.6s^2 + 3.2s

So, equation becomes:

18 = 1.6s^2 + 3.2s

Let me rearrange this:

1.6s^2 + 3.2s - 18 = 0

Hmm, to make it easier, perhaps multiply both sides by 10 to eliminate decimals:

16s^2 + 32s - 180 = 0

Wait, 1.6 *10 =16, 3.2*10=32, 18*10=180.

Wait, no, 18*10 is 180, yes. But the equation is 18 = 1.6s^2 + 3.2s â†’ 1.6s^2 +3.2s -18=0.
