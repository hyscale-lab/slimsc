Okay, so I've got this math problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again and make sure I understand all the conditions.

The problem says: A list of positive integers has three properties. First, the sum of all the items is 30. Second, the unique mode is 9. Third, the median is a positive integer that doesn't appear in the list. I need to find the sum of the squares of all the items in the list.

Alright, let's break this down. I think I'll start by recalling what each term means. The mode is the number that appears most frequently in the list, and it's unique, meaning no other number appears as many times as 9. The median is the middle number when the list is ordered from smallest to largest. But wait, the median doesn't appear in the list itself. That's interesting because usually, the median is one of the numbers in the list, especially if the list has an odd number of elements. But here, it's not. So maybe the list has an even number of elements, and the median is the average of two middle numbers, which isn't an integer present in the list.

Let me jot down the key points:

1. Sum of all items = 30
2. Mode is 9 (unique)
3. Median is a positive integer not present in the list.

So, first, let's consider the mode. Since 9 is the unique mode, it must appear more times than any other number. Let's denote the number of times 9 appears as k. Then, every other number in the list must appear fewer than k times. So, if 9 appears twice, others can appear at most once. If 9 appears three times, others can appear at most twice, but wait, no, because 9 is the unique mode, so the next highest count must be less than k. So, for example, if 9 appears 3 times, others can appear at most 2 times.

Next, the sum is 30. So, the total of all numbers is 30. Let's think about how many 9s we can have.

Let me try to figure out how many times 9 must appear. Let's say we have a list with m elements. The median depends on whether m is odd or even. Because the median is an integer not in the list, m must be even because the median would be the average of two middle numbers. Wait, but the median is a positive integer, so the average of the two middle numbers must be an integer. That means the two middle numbers must be either both even or both odd so their average is an integer. And that median isn't present in the list.

Let me think about the structure of the list. Let's say the list is sorted in non-decreasing order. Since the median is not in the list, and it's an integer, the two middle numbers must average to that integer. So, for example, if the median is 7, then the two middle numbers could be 6 and 8, because (6+8)/2=7, and 7 isn't in the list. Alternatively, 5 and 9 would average to 7 as well, but if the list contains 9, that's okay as long as 7 isn't present.

Wait, but 9 is the mode, so 9 appears more frequently than any other number. So, let's say we have a list where 9 is the mode, and the median is an integer not in the list.

Let me try to approach this by considering possible numbers of elements in the list. Let's say the list has n elements. If n is odd, the median is the middle number, which would have to be 9 if 9 is the mode. But wait, the problem says the median is not in the list. So, that means the median can't be 9 if the list has an odd number of elements because 9 would be in the middle. Therefore, the list must have an even number of elements. So, n is even
