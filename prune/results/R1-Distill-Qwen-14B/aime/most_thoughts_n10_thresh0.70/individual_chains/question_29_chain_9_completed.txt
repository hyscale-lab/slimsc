Okay, so I've got this geometry problem here. Let me try to visualize it first. There are two rectangles, ABCD and EFGH. Points D, E, C, F are collinear. So, if I imagine the points on a straight line, D is connected to E, E to C, and C to F. Hmm, but wait, rectangles have four sides, so maybe I should think about how these rectangles are placed relative to each other.

Also, it's given that points A, D, H, G all lie on a circle. That means these four points are concyclic or lie on the same circumference. Interesting. So, rectangle ABCD has points A, B, C, D, and rectangle EFGH has E, F, G, H. Since ABCD and EFGH are rectangles, all their angles are 90 degrees, and opposite sides are equal.

Given lengths: BC = 16, AB = 107, FG = 17, EF = 184. We need to find the length of CE.

Let me list out what I know:

1. ABCD is a rectangle, so opposite sides are equal. So, AB = CD = 107, BC = AD = 16.
2. EFGH is another rectangle, so EF = GH = 184, FG = EH = 17.
3. Points D, E, C, F are collinear. So, they lie on a straight line. That line must be the same for all four points.
4. Points A, D, H, G lie on a circle. So, quadrilateral ADHG is cyclic.

I need to find CE. Hmm. Let me try to sketch this mentally.

Since D, E, C, F are collinear, the line passes through D, then E, then C, then F. So, points D-E-C-F are on a straight line.

Since ABCD is a rectangle, sides AB and CD are both 107, and BC and AD are 16. So, AB is 107, BC is 16, making ABCD a rectangle with length 107 and width 16.

Similarly, EFGH is a rectangle with sides EF = 184 and FG = 17. So, EFGH has length 184 and width 17.

Now, since D, E, C, F are on a straight line, the line D-E-C-F is likely a transversal that intersects both rectangles. I need to figure out how these rectangles are positioned relative to each other.

Wait, maybe it's better to assign coordinates to each point. That might help me compute the required length.

Let me set up a coordinate system. Let's assume point D is at the origin (0,0). Since ABCD is a rectangle, and if I take D as (0,0), then C would be at (107,0) because DC is 107. Point B would be at (0,16), and point A would be at (0,16) + (107,0) = (107,16)? Wait, no. Wait, ABCD is a rectangle. So, going from D(0,0), moving along DC, which is 107 units, so C is at (107,0). Then, from D, moving up along DA, which is 16 units, so A would be at (0,16). Then, B would be at (107,16). Because in a rectangle, opposite sides are equal and the sides are at right angles.

So, ABCD has coordinates:

- D: (0,0)
- C: (107,0)
- B: (107,16)
- A: (0,16)

Now, rectangle EFGH. Since E, F, G, H are the corners, and since D, E, C, F are collinear, I need to figure out where E and F are.

Wait, points D, E, C, F are collinear. So, D is at (0,0), E is somewhere on that line, then C is at (107,0), and F is further along the line. So, the line is the x-axis in my coordinate system.

Wait, if D is (0,0) and C is (107,0), and E and F are on the same line, then E and F must lie somewhere on the x-axis.

But EFGH is a rectangle. So, if E is on the x-axis, then the rectangle EFGH must either be above or below the x-axis. Since points A, D, H, G lie on a circle, and A is (0,16), D is (0,0), H and G must be points such that ADHG is cyclic.

Wait, let me think. If EFGH is a rectangle and E and F are on the x-axis, then G and H must be above or below the x-axis. Let's assume they're above for now, but I might need to adjust that.

So, let me assign coordinates to E and F. Since E and F are on the x-axis, let me denote E as (e, 0) and F as (f, 0). Since they are collinear with D and C, e and f must be along the x-axis.

But wait, D is at (0,0), E is somewhere on the line, then C is at (107,0), then F is further out. So, the order is D-E-C-F along the x-axis. So, the x-coordinates must satisfy 0 < e < 107 < f.

Now, rectangle EFGH has sides EF and FG. EF is 184 units long, which is the length from E to F, so the distance between E and F on the x-axis is 184. Wait, no, EF is a side of the rectangle, but in the problem statement, EF is a side of the rectangle EFGH, so EF = 184, FG = 17.

Wait, but in the rectangle, EF and FG are adjacent sides, so EF is one side, FG is another, meeting at point F. So, in terms of coordinates, if E is (e,0) and F is (f,0), then from F, moving up (assuming rectangle is above the x-axis) by 17 units to point G, which would be (f,17). Then from G, moving left by 184 units to point H, which would be (f-184, 17). Wait, but that would only be if EF is horizontal and FG is vertical.

Alternatively, it could be that EF is the base, length 184, FG is the height, 17. So, the rectangle EFGH would have E at (e,0), F at (e+184,0), then G at (e+184,17), and H at (e,17). Wait, but then H would be at (e,17). So, then point H is at (e,17), point G is at (e+184,17).

But since E, F, G, H are the corners of the rectangle, moving from E to F to G to H and back to E.

But in this case, EF is 184, FG is 17. So, the rectangle is 184 by 17.

Wait, but earlier, I thought E and F are on the x-axis, but wait, if E is at (e,0) and F is at (e + 184,0), then the distance between E and F is 184, which is EF = 184. Then, from F, moving upwards 17 units to G at (e+184,17), and then from G moving left to H at (e,17), then down to E. So, that's correct.

But in that case, the coordinates are:

- E: (e, 0)
- F: (e + 184, 0)
- G: (e + 184, 17)
- H: (e, 17)

But in the problem statement, it's given that D, E, C, F are collinear on the x-axis. So, E is at (e,0) and F is at (e + 184,0). But since D is at (0,0) and C is at (107,0), E must lie between D and C, and F must lie beyond C. So, e must be between 0 and 107, and e + 184 must be greater than 107.

Wait, e needs to satisfy 0 < e < 107, and e + 184 > 107. So, e must be less than 107, but e + 184 > 107. Since 184 is much larger than 107, e can be any value between 0 and 107. Wait, but that might not be the case because we also have points A, D, H, G lying on a circle.

So, points A, D, H, G are on a circle. A is at (0,16), D is at (0,0), H is at (e,17), and G is at (e + 184,17). So, these four points must lie on a circle. Let me note their coordinates:

- A: (0,16)
- D: (0,0)
- H: (e,17)
- G: (e + 184,17)

Hmm, so four points with these coordinates lie on a circle. Let me try to find the condition for concyclic points.

For four points to lie on a circle, the determinant of their coordinates in the circle equation must be zero. Alternatively, since three points define a circle, the fourth must satisfy the equation.

Alternatively, using power of a point or cyclic quadrilateral properties.

But maybe it's easier to write the general equation of a circle passing through three points and see if the fourth lies on it.

Let me find the equation of the circle passing through A(0,16), D(0,0), and H(e,17). Then I can check if G(e + 184,17) lies on the same circle.

The general equation of a circle is x² + y² + 2gx + 2fy + c = 0.

Plugging in D(0,0):

0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + c = 0 => c = 0. So, the equation simplifies to x² + y² + 2gx + 2fy = 0.

Plugging in A(0,16):

0 + (16)^2 + 0 + 2f(16) = 0

256 + 32f = 0 => 32f = -256 => f = -8.

So, the equation becomes x² + y² + 2gx - 16y = 0.

Now, plugging in H(e,17):

e² + (17)^2 + 2g e - 16(17) = 0

e² + 289 + 2g e - 272 = 0

Simplify:

e² + 2g e + 17 = 0.

Hmm, so that's one equation: e² + 2g e + 17 = 0.

Now, we need point G(e + 184,17) to lie on this circle as well. Let's plug G into the equation:

(e + 184)^2 + (17)^2 + 2g(e + 184) - 16(17) = 0.

Let me expand this:

(e + 184)^2 is e² + 368e + (184)^2.

So, e² + 368e + 33856.

17^2 is 289.

2g(e + 184) is 2g e + 368g.

-16 * 17 is -272.

So putting it all together:

e² + 368e + 33856 + 289 + 2g e + 368g - 272 = 0.

Combine like terms:

e² + (368 + 2g)e + (33856 + 289 - 272) + 368g = 0.

Calculate the constants:

33856 + 289 = 34145; 34145 - 272 = 33873.

So, equation becomes:

e² + (368 + 2g)e + 33873 + 368g = 0.

Now, from the earlier equation when plugging H(e,17):

e² + 2g e + 17 = 0.

Let me denote that as equation (1):

Equation (1): e² + 2g e + 17 = 0.

Equation (2) from point G: e² + (368 + 2g)e + 33873 + 368g = 0.

Subtract equation (1) from equation (2):

[ e² + (368 + 2g)e + 33873 + 368g ] - [ e² + 2g e + 17 ] = 0 - 0.

Simplify:

(368 + 2g - 2g)e + (33873 + 368g - 17) = 0.

So, 368 e + (33856 + 368 g) = 0.

Factor out 368:

368 (e + g) + 33856 = 0.

Wait, wait, no. Let me see:

Wait, 33873 - 17 = 33856, right? Yes.

So, 368 e + 33856 + 368 g = 0.

Factor 368 out:

368 (e + g + 92) = 0. Because 33856 / 368 = let's calculate:

33856 ÷ 368.

Well, 368 * 90 = 33120.

33856 - 33120 = 736.

368 * 2 = 736.

So, 90 + 2 = 92. So, 368 * 92 = 33856.

So, 368 (e + g + 92) = 0.

Since 368 ≠ 0, we have:

e + g + 92 = 0 => g = - (e + 92).

Now, from equation (1):

e² + 2g e + 17 = 0.

Substitute g = - (e + 92):

e² + 2*(- (e +92)) * e +17 = 0.

Simplify:

e² - 2e(e +92) +17=0.

Expand:

e² - 2e² -184 e +17=0.

Combine like terms:

- e² -184 e +17=0.

Multiply both sides by -1:

e² + 184 e -17=0.

So, quadratic equation in e:

e² + 184 e -17 = 0.

Let's solve for e using quadratic formula.

e = [ -184 ± sqrt(184^2 + 4*17) ] / 2.

Compute discriminant:

184^2 = (180 +4)^2 = 180^2 + 2*180*4 +4^2=32400 + 1440 +16=33856.

4*17=68.

So, discriminant is 33856 + 68 = 33924.

So, sqrt(33924) = let's see:

184^2 = 33856, so 184. Let's calculate sqrt(33924):

184^2 = 33856, 185^2=34225. So, 33924 is between them.

Compute 184.5^2 = (184 + 0.5)^2 = 184² + 2*184*0.5 +0.25=33856 +184 +0.25=34040.25, which is more than 33924.

Wait, maybe 184.2^2: 184^2 = 33856.

(184.2)^2 = (184 +0.2)^2=184² + 2*184*0.2 +0.2²=33856 +73.6 +0.04=33929.64.

Hmm, 33929.64 is more than 33924, so sqrt(33924) is a little less than 184.2.

Wait, 184.1^2= ?

184^2=33856.

184.1^2 = 33856 + 2*184*0.1 +0.1²=33856 +36.8 +0.01= 33892.81.

Wait, 33892.81 is still less than 33924. The difference is 33924 -33892.81=31.19.

So, how much more to add to 184.1 to get the square to 33924.

Let me set x=184.1 + d, such that (x)^2 =33924.

So, (184.1 + d)^2 ≈ 33924.

We have:

(184.1)^2 + 2*184.1*d + d² =33924.

We know 184.1² is 33892.81. So,

33892.81 + 368.2*d + d² =33924.

Subtract 33892.81:

368.2*d + d² =31.19.

Assuming d is small, d² is negligible, so:

368.2*d ≈31.19 => d≈31.19/368.2≈0.0847.

So, sqrt(33924)≈184.1 + 0.0847≈184.1847.

So, sqrt(33924)≈184.1847.

So, going back to the quadratic equation for e:

e = [ -184 ± 184.1847 ] / 2.

So, two possibilities:

1. e = [ -184 +184.1847 ] /2 ≈ (0.1847)/2≈0.09235.

2. e = [ -184 -184.1847 ] /2≈ (-368.1847)/2≈-184.09235.

But e must be between 0 and 107 because E is on the line between D(0,0) and C(107,0). So, negative e is not possible, so e≈0.09235.

Wait, that's approximately 0.09235 units. That's very close to 0. So, point E is almost at D, but a bit to the right.

So, e≈0.09235.

But let me compute this more accurately, perhaps. Maybe we can find an exact value.

Wait, the quadratic equation was e² +184 e -17=0.

So, e = [ -184 ± sqrt(184² +68) ] /2.

Which is e = [ -184 ± sqrt(33856 +68) ] /2 = [ -184 ± sqrt(33924) ] /2.

Wait, let me see if 33924 is a perfect square. Let me try to factor it.

33924 divided by 4 is 8481. 8481 is divisible by 3: 8+4+8+1=21, which is divisible by 3. 8481 ÷3=2827.

2827, check divisibility: 2+8+2+7=19, not divisible by 3. Let's check if it's prime. Hmm, 2827 ÷7=403.857... Not integer. 2827 ÷13=217.461... Not integer. 2827 ÷17≈166.29, nope. Maybe 2827 is prime? Not sure.

So, 33924=4*8481=4*3*2827. Doesn't seem like a perfect square. So, perhaps we have to leave it as sqrt(33924). Alternatively, factor it:

Wait, 33924=4*8481.

8481= let's see, 8481 divided by 3 is 2827. 2827, as above, is 2827. Let me check 2827 divided by 13: 2827 ÷13=217.461, not integer. 2827 ÷7=403.857, nope.

Hmm, maybe 2827 is prime. So, sqrt(33924)=2*sqrt(8481), which doesn't simplify further. So, we can leave it as [ -184 ± 2*sqrt(8481) ] / 2 = [ -184 ± sqrt(33924) ] /2.

But perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let me double-check the equations.

Wait, from equation (1): e² +2g e +17=0.

From equation (2): e² + (368 + 2g)e +33873 +368g=0.

Subtracting equation (1) from equation (2):

(368 + 2g - 2g)e + (33873 +368g -17)=0 =>368 e +33856 +368g=0.

So, 368(e +g )= -33856.

Wait, earlier I thought 33856 is 368*92.

Compute 368*92:

368 *90=33120, 368*2=736, so total 33120+736=33856.

So, 368*(e +g )= -33856 => e + g= -33856/368= -92.

So, e +g= -92.

Thus, g= -92 -e.

Plugging into equation (1): e² +2*(-92 -e)*e +17=0.

Which is e² -184 e -2e² +17=0.

Simplify: -e² -184 e +17=0 => e² +184 e -17=0.

Yes, that's correct.

So, the quadratic equation is correct, so e= [ -184 ± sqrt(184² +4*17) ] / 2.

Which is [ -184 ± sqrt(33856 +68) ] /2 = [ -184 ± sqrt(33924) ] /2.

As before.

So, the positive solution is e=( -184 + sqrt(33924) ) /2.

Compute sqrt(33924). Let me see, 184^2=33856, so sqrt(33856 +68)=sqrt(33856+68)=sqrt(33924). 

Wait, 184.184^2 is (184 + 0.184)^2=184^2 + 2*184*0.184 +0.184^2=33856 + 67.232 +0.033856≈33856+67.232=33923.232 +0.033856≈33923.265856.

Wait, but we have sqrt(33924). So, 184.184^2≈33923.265856, which is a bit less than 33924. The difference is 33924 -33923.265856≈0.734144.

So, to find a better approximation:

Let me let x=184.184 + delta, such that (x)^2=33924.

We have (184.184 + delta)^2 =33924.

Expand:

(184.184)^2 + 2*184.184*delta + delta^2=33924.

We know (184.184)^2≈33923.265856.

So,

33923.265856 + 368.368*delta + delta^2=33924.

Subtract 33923.265856:

368.368*delta + delta^2≈0.734144.

Assume delta is very small, delta^2 is negligible.

So, 368.368*delta≈0.734144 => delta≈0.734144 / 368.368≈0.001992.

So, x≈184.184 +0.001992≈184.185992.

Thus, sqrt(33924)≈184.186.

So, e=( -184 +184.186 ) /2≈(0.186)/2≈0.093.

So, e≈0.093.

So, e≈0.093 units.

Therefore, point E is at (e,0)=(0.093,0).

Point F is at (e +184,0)=(0.093+184,0)=184.093,0.

Now, since we have E at (0.093,0), F at (184.093,0).

We need to find CE. Point C is at (107,0). So, CE is the distance between C(107,0) and E(0.093,0).

Wait, but E is before D? Wait, no, D is at (0,0). E is at (0.093,0), which is just a bit to the right of D. So, the order is D(0,0), E(0.093,0), C(107,0), F(184.093,0).

So, CE is the distance from E to C along the x-axis. So, CE=107 - e.

Since e≈0.093, CE≈107 -0.093≈106.907.

But wait, that seems odd. Because E is very close to D, so CE is almost 107. But let's see.

Wait, but I need to confirm if this is correct. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the setup.

Wait, because E is before C, so CE= C's x-coordinate minus E's x-coordinate.

Given that, CE=107 - e.

But e is approximately 0.093, so CE≈106.907, which is roughly 106.91. But the problem probably expects an integer answer.

Wait, but perhaps I can find an exact value.

We had e=( -184 + sqrt(33924) ) /2.

Wait, sqrt(33924)=sqrt(4*8481)=2*sqrt(8481).

So, e=( -184 + 2*sqrt(8481) ) /2= (-92 + sqrt(8481)).

So, e= sqrt(8481) -92.

Wait, sqrt(8481)=?

Wait, 92^2=8464, so sqrt(8481)=92. something.

92^2=8464, 93^2=8649. So, 8481 is 8481-8464=17 more than 92^2.

So, sqrt(8481)=92 +17/(2*92) approximately, using the binomial approximation.

So, sqrt(8481)=92 +17/(184)=92 +0.092398≈92.092398.

Thus, e=92.092398 -92=0.092398.

So, e≈0.092398, which is about 0.0924.

Thus, CE=107 - e≈107 -0.0924≈106.9076.

But the problem is given with integer lengths, so perhaps the exact value is 107 - e, but e is sqrt(8481)-92. So, CE=107 - (sqrt(8481)-92)=107 +92 -sqrt(8481)=199 -sqrt(8481).

Wait, that's an exact expression. But 8481 is not a perfect square, so perhaps this is as simplified as it can get. But the problem asks for the integer length of CE, which suggests that CE is an integer. So, perhaps my assumption is wrong somewhere.

Wait, maybe I made an error in the coordinate system. Let me think again.

Wait, in the problem statement, it says D, E, C, F are collinear. So, the order is D-E-C-F. But in my coordinate system, I assumed D is at (0,0), C at (107,0). So, E is at (e,0) between D and C, and F at (e +184,0) beyond C.

But if E is between D and C, and F is beyond C, then EF=184 is the length from E to F, which is 184 units. So, the distance from E to F should be 184, but in the coordinate system, the distance is (e +184) - e=184, which is correct.

But then, CE is the distance from C(107,0) to E(e,0), which is 107 - e.

But according to the earlier calculation, e≈0.0924, so CE≈106.9076, which is approximately 107, but not exactly.

Wait, but maybe I made an error in the assumption that EFGH is above the x-axis. What if EFGH is below the x-axis? Let me try that.

If EFGH is below the x-axis, then points G and H would be at (e, -17) and (e +184, -17).

Then, points A(0,16), D(0,0), H(e, -17), G(e+184, -17) lie on a circle.

Let me try this case.

So, using the same approach, let me write the equation of the circle passing through A(0,16), D(0,0), and H(e,-17). Then check if G(e +184, -17) lies on it.

The general equation: x² + y² +2gx +2fy +c=0.

Plug D(0,0): 0 +0 +0 +0 +c=0=>c=0.

So, equation becomes x² + y² +2gx +2fy=0.

Plug A(0,16):

0 + 256 +0 +32f=0 =>32f = -256 =>f= -8.

So, equation becomes x² + y² +2gx -16y=0.

Now, plug H(e,-17):

e² + (-17)^2 + 2g e -16*(-17)=0.

Compute:

e² +289 +2g e +272=0.

Simplify:

e² +2g e +561=0. That's equation (1).

Now, plug G(e +184, -17):

(e +184)^2 + (-17)^2 +2g(e +184) -16*(-17)=0.

Expand:

e² +368e +184² +289 +2g e +368g +272=0.

Compute:

e² +368e +33856 +289 +2g e +368g +272=0.

Simplify:

e² + (368 +2g)e + (33856 +289 +272) +368g=0.

Calculate constants:

33856 +289=34145; 34145 +272=34417.

So, equation becomes:

e² + (368 +2g)e +34417 +368g=0. Equation (2).

Subtract equation (1) from equation (2):

[e² + (368 +2g)e +34417 +368g] - [e² +2g e +561] =0.

Simplify:

(368 +2g -2g)e + (34417 +368g -561)=0.

Which is:

368 e + (34417 -561 +368g)=0.

Compute 34417 -561=33856.

So, 368 e +33856 +368g=0.

Factor 368:

368 (e +g ) +33856=0.

As before, 33856=368*92.

So,

368(e +g ) +368*92=0.

Factor:

368 (e +g +92)=0.

Since 368≠0,

e +g +92=0 => g= - (e +92).

Plug into equation (1):

e² +2*(-e -92)*e +561=0.

Simplify:

e² - 2e² -184 e +561=0.

Which becomes:

-e² -184 e +561=0.

Multiply by -1:

e² +184 e -561=0.

Solve using quadratic formula:

e= [ -184 ± sqrt(184² +4*561) ] /2.

Compute discriminant:

184²=33856, 4*561=2244.

So, sqrt(33856 +2244)=sqrt(36100).

Wait, 36100 is 190^2. So, sqrt(36100)=190.

So, e= [ -184 ±190 ] /2.

So, two solutions:

1. e=( -184 +190 ) /2=6/2=3.

2. e=( -184 -190 ) /2= (-374)/2= -187.

Since e must be between 0 and107 (because E is between D and C), e=3 is acceptable, e=-187 is not.

So, e=3.

Thus, E is at (3,0), F is at (3 +184,0)=(187,0).

So, CE is the distance from C(107,0) to E(3,0), which is 107 -3=104.

Wait, that's an integer! 104.

So, this makes sense. So, the correct value is 104.

Wait, so in the first case, when I assumed the rectangle was above the x-axis, I got CE≈106.907, which is not integer. But when I assumed the rectangle is below the x-axis, I got CE=104, which is integer.

Therefore, the correct answer is 104.

So, the length of CE is 104 units.


To solve the problem, we start by assigning coordinates to the points of the rectangles and using the given conditions to determine the positions of the points.

1. **Assigning Coordinates:**
   - Place rectangle \(ABCD\) with \(D\) at the origin \((0,0)\). Thus:
     - \(D = (0,0)\)
     - \(C = (107,0)\) (since \(BC = 16\) and \(AB = 107\))
     - \(A = (0,16)\)
     - \(B = (107,16)\)

2. **Positioning Rectangle \(EFGH\):**
   - Since \(D, E, C, F\) are collinear on the x-axis, let \(E = (e,0)\) and \(F = (e+184,0)\) because \(EF = 184\).
   - Points \(A, D, H, G\) lie on a circle. Assuming \(EFGH\) is below the x-axis, the coordinates of \(H\) and \(G\) are:
     - \(H = (e, -17)\)
     - \(G = (e+184, -17)\)

3. **Circle Equation:**
   - The general equation of the circle passing through \(A(0,16)\), \(D(0,0)\), and \(H(e,-17)\) is derived as:
     \[
     x^2 + y^2 + 2gx + 2fy = 0
     \]
   - Substituting \(D(0,0)\) gives \(c = 0\). Substituting \(A(0,16)\) gives \(f = -8\). Thus, the equation becomes:
     \[
     x^2 + y^2 + 2gx - 16y = 0
     \]
   - Substituting \(H(e,-17)\) gives:
     \[
     e^2 + 289 + 2ge + 272 = 0 \implies e^2 + 2ge + 561 = 0
     \]
   - Substituting \(G(e+184, -17)\) into the circle equation and simplifying leads to:
     \[
     e^2 + 184e - 561 = 0
     \]
   - Solving this quadratic equation using the quadratic formula:
     \[
     e = \frac{-184 \pm \sqrt{184^2 + 4 \cdot 561}}{2} = \frac{-184 \pm 190}{2}
     \]
     The positive solution is \(e = 3\).

4. **Calculating \(CE\):**
   - With \(e = 3\), \(E\) is at \((3,0)\) and \(C\) is at \((107,0)\). Thus, the distance \(CE\) is:
     \[
     CE = 107 - 3 = 104
     \]

The length of \(CE\) is \(\boxed{104}\).
