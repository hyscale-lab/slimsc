Okay, so I've got this geometry problem here about two rectangles, ABCD and EFGH. The problem says that points D, E, C, F are collinear. Also, points A, D, H, G all lie on a circle. The given lengths are BC=16, AB=107, FG=17, and EF=184. I need to find the length of CE.

Hmm, let's start by drawing a rough sketch to visualize the problem. I imagine two rectangles, ABCD and EFGH. Since D, E, C, F are collinear, that line must be a diagonal or some common edge? Wait, but they're points on the sides of the rectangles. Let me think.

In rectangle ABCD, BC is one of the sides. Since BC=16 and AB=107, that makes rectangle ABCD a 107 by 16 rectangle. Similarly, in rectangle EFGH, FG=17 and EF=184, so EFGH is a 184 by 17 rectangle.

Now, since D, E, C, F are collinear, that line must pass through points D, E, C, F. So maybe E is somewhere along DC, and F is another point? Wait, but E and F are points on EFGH. Hmm, perhaps I need to figure out how these rectangles are placed relative to each other.

Also, A, D, H, G lie on a circle. That's interesting. Points A and D are from rectangle ABCD, and H and G are from EFGH. So the circle passes through these four points. Maybe it's the circumcircle of a cyclic quadrilateral?

Let me try to label the points. Let's assume rectangle ABCD is placed such that AB is the base, BC is the height. So points are in order A, B, C, D. Similarly, EFGH would have E, F, G, H. But since D, E, C, F are collinear, perhaps EFGH is placed such that EF is a side, and the line EFCD is straight?

Wait, but E and F are points on EFGH, so perhaps EF is a side of EFGH, which is 184 units long. Hmm, but BC is 16, FG is 17
