Okay, so I've got this problem here with logarithms and variables x, y, and z. Hmm, let me see. The equations are:

1. log₂(x/(y z)) = 1/2
2. log₂(y/(x z)) = 1/3
3. log₂(z/(x y)) = 1/4

And we need to find the absolute value of log₂(x⁴ y³ z²), which will be a fraction m/n, and then find m + n.

First, I remember that log₂(a/b) = log₂ a - log₂ b. So maybe I can rewrite each equation using that property.

Starting with the first equation:
log₂(x) - log₂(y) - log₂(z) = 1/2.

Similarly, the second equation:
log₂(y) - log₂(x) - log₂(z) = 1/3.

And the third equation:
log₂(z) - log₂(x) - log₂(y) = 1/4.

Hmm, interesting. So if I let a = log₂(x), b = log₂(y), and c = log₂(z), then the equations become:

1. a - b - c = 1/2
2. -a + b - c = 1/3
3. -a - b + c = 1/4

Now I have a system of three linear equations with three variables a, b, c. I can try solving this system.

Let me write them again:

1. a - b - c = 1/2
2. -a + b - c = 1/3
3. -a - b + c = 1/4

I think I'll add all three equations together to see if that helps. Adding equation 1, 2, and 3:

(a - b - c) + (-a + b - c) + (-a - b + c) = 1/2 + 1/3 + 1/4

Let me compute the left side:

a - b - c - a + b - c - a - b + c = combine like terms.

a - a - a = -a.

-b + b - b = -b.

-c - c + c = -c.

So altogether: -a - b - c = 1/2 + 1/3 + 1/4.

Wait, but on the right side, let's compute the sum:

1/2 is 6/12, 1/3 is 4/12, 1/4 is 3/12. So 6 + 4 + 3 = 13, so 13/12.

So, -a - b - c = 13/12.

But that's interesting. Now, if I can find a, b, c individually, then I can compute log₂(x⁴ y³ z²) as 4a + 3b + 2c.

Wait, let me make sure. Because x⁴ y³ z² would have exponents 4,3,2 on x,y,z, so log₂(x⁴ y³ z²) = log₂(x⁴) + log₂(y³) + log₂(z²) = 4 log₂x + 3 log₂y + 2 log₂z = 4a + 3b + 2c.

So we need to find 4a + 3b + 2c in absolute value.

But first, let's solve for a, b, c.

We have:

Equation 1: a - b - c = 1/2

Equation 2: -a + b - c = 1/3

Equation 3: -a - b + c = 1/4

And from adding all three, we have:

-a - b - c = 13/12 --> Equation 4.

So, equation 4: -a - b - c = 13/12.

Now, let's see if we can express other equations in terms of equation 4.

Let me try solving the system step by step.

First, let's subtract equation 2 from equation 1:

Equation 1: a - b - c = 1/2

Equation 2: -a + b - c = 1/3

Subtract equation 2 from equation 1:

(a - (-a)) + (-b - b) + (-c - (-c)) = 1/2 - 1/3

So: 2a - 2b = (3/6 - 2/6) = 1/6.

Divide both sides by 2: a - b = 1/12 --> Equation 5.

Similarly, let's subtract equation 3 from equation 1:

Equation 1: a - b - c = 1/2

Equation 3: -a - b + c = 1/4

Subtract equation 3 from equation 1:

(a - (-a)) + (-b - (-b)) + (-c - c) = 1/2 - 1/4

So: 2a - 2c = 1/4.

Divide by 2: a - c = 1/8 --> Equation 6.

Similarly, let's subtract equation 3 from equation 2:

Equation 2: -a + b - c = 1/3

Equation 3: -a - b + c = 1/4

Subtract equation 3 from equation 2:

(-a - (-a)) + (b - (-b)) + (-c - c) = 1/3 - 1/4

So: 0a + 2b - 2c = 1/12.

Divide by 2: b - c = 1/24 --> Equation 7.

Now, from equations 5, 6, and 7:

Equation 5: a - b = 1/12

Equation 6: a - c = 1/8

Equation 7: b - c = 1/24

So now, we have a system of three equations in a, b, c.

Let me write them again:

1. a - b = 1/12

2. a - c = 1/8

3. b - c = 1/24

I can try solving for variables.

Let me express a from equation 5: a = b + 1/12.

From equation 7: b = c + 1/24.

So substituting into a: a = (c + 1/24) + 1/12 = c + 1/24 + 2/24 = c + 3/24 = c + 1/8.

So now, a = c + 1/8.

From equation 6: a - c = 1/8.

Which matches what we just got, because a = c + 1/8.

So that's consistent.

So now, let's pick one variable to solve for.

Let me assign c as a variable. Then:

From equation 7: b = c + 1/24.

From equation 5: a = b + 1/12 = (c + 1/24) + 1/12 = c + 1/24 + 2/24 = c + 3/24 = c + 1/8.

We can now use equation 4, which is -a - b - c =13/12.

Substitute a and b in terms of c:

-a = -(c + 1/8) = -c -1/8

-b = -(c + 1/24) = -c -1/24

So:

(-c -1/8) + (-c -1/24) + (-c) = 13/12

Combine like terms:

-3c - (1/8 + 1/24) = 13/12

Compute 1/8 + 1/24: 3/24 + 1/24 = 4/24 = 1/6.

So:

-3c - 1/6 = 13/12

Bring -1/6 to the other side:

-3c = 13/12 + 1/6

Convert 1/6 to 2/12:

13/12 + 2/12 = 15/12 = 5/4.

So:

-3c = 5/4

Then, c = -5/(4*3) = -5/12.

Hmm, c is log₂(z) = -5/12.

Wait, but z is a positive real number, so log₂(z) can be negative, which would mean z is between 0 and 1. That's fine.

Now, find b from equation 7: b = c + 1/24.

c = -5/12, so:

b = (-5/12) + 1/24 = (-10/24 + 1/24) = (-9)/24 = -3/8.

Similarly, a from equation 5: a = b + 1/12.

b is -3/8, so:

a = (-3/8) + 1/12 = (-9/2
