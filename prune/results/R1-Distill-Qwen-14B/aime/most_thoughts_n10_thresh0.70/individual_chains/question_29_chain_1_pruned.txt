Okay, so I have this geometry problem here about two rectangles, ABCD and EFGH. The problem says that points D, E, C, F are collinear. Also, points A, D, H, G lie on a circle. The given lengths are BC = 16, AB = 107, FG = 17, and EF = 184. I need to find the length of CE.

Hmm, let me try to visualize this. So, we have two rectangles. ABCD is a rectangle, so opposite sides are equal and all angles are right angles. Similarly, EFGH is another rectangle. Now, D, E, C, F are collinear. So, if I imagine points D, E, C, F lying on a straight line in that order, maybe? Or some other order, but probably D-E-C-F or something similar.

Also, A, D, H, G are concyclic, meaning they lie on the same circle. That might be important for applying some cyclic quadrilateral theorems.

Given BC = 16. Since ABCD is a rectangle, BC is one of the sides. Let me label the rectangle: ABCD, so AB and CD are the lengths, BC and AD are the widths. So BC = 16, which is the width, and AB = 107, which is the length. So the rectangle ABCD has sides 107 and 16.

Similarly, for rectangle EFGH, FG = 17. Since EFGH is a rectangle, FG is one side. Also, EF = 184, so EF and GH are the lengths, FG and EH are the widths. So EFGH has sides 184 and 17.

Now, I need to find CE. Since C and E are points, I should probably figure out their positions relative to each other.

Let me try to sketch a rough diagram. So, place rectangle ABCD such that point D is at the origin for simplicity. Then, since ABCD is a rectangle, point C would be at (107, 16), assuming AB is along the x-axis.

Wait, actually, let's assign coordinates. Let me assign coordinate system with point D at (0,0). Since ABCD is a rectangle, if D is (0,0), then C would be at (AB, BC) = (107, 16). Point B would be at (0, 16), and point A at (107, 0). Hmm, no, wait. Let me think again.

Wait, in a rectangle ABCD, the order is such that AB is adjacent to BC. So, if we have point A, then B, then C, then D. So, if I place D at (0,0), then C would be at (something, 0), but since BC is 16, perhaps it's better to assign coordinates differently.

Wait, maybe it's better to assign point D at (0,0), C at (a, 0), B at (a, b), and A at (0, b). Since ABCD is a rectangle, opposite sides are equal. So, AB = CD = a, and BC = AD = b. Wait, but in the problem, BC is 16 and AB is 107. So, BC is the vertical side, and AB is the horizontal side.

So, if I place D at (0,0), then C is at (107, 0), because AB is 107, so CD is also 107. Then, since BC is 16, point B would be at (107, 16). Then, point A would be at (0, 16). So, rectangle ABCD has coordinates: D(0,0), C(107,0), B(107,16), A(0,16).

Now, rectangle EFGH is another rectangle. Points D, E, C, F are collinear. So, the line DC (from D(0,0) to C(107,0)) has points E and F on it. So, E and F must lie somewhere on the line y=0.

Wait, but E and F are part of rectangle EFGH. So, E is connected to F, which is part of the rectangle EFGH. So, EF is one side of the rectangle. Since EF is given as 184, which is a length, and FG is 17.

Wait, in rectangle EFGH, EF and FG are adjacent sides, so EF is length 184, FG is width 17.

But in the problem, it's stated that D, E, C, F are collinear. So, E and F are somewhere on the line DC, which is the x-axis from (0,0) to (107,
