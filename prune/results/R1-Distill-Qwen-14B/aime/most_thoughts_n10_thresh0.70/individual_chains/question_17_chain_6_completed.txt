Okay, so I've got this math problem here. Let me try to break it down and understand what it's asking for. 

The problem says: We have a set B of rectangular boxes. Each of these boxes has a surface area of 54 and a volume of 23. We need to find the radius of the smallest sphere that can contain any of these boxes. Then, we have to express r squared as a fraction p/q where p and q are coprime, and find p + q.

Hmm, so first, I think I should start by understanding the properties of a rectangular box. A rectangular box has three dimensions: length, width, and height. Let's denote them as x, y, and z. 

Given that the surface area is 54, I remember the formula for the surface area of a rectangular box is 2(xy + yz + xz) = 54. So, simplifying that, we get:

xy + yz + xz = 27.    (1)

Also, the volume is given as 23, and the volume of a rectangular box is xyz = 23.     (2)

Our goal is to find the smallest sphere that can contain such a box. The sphere must enclose the box completely, so the diameter of the sphere must be equal to the space diagonal of the box. The space diagonal d of a box with sides x, y, z is given by sqrt(x² + y² + z²). 

Since the sphere must contain the entire box, the diameter of the sphere must be at least as long as the space diagonal. Therefore, the radius r of the sphere would be half of that diagonal:

r = (1/2) * sqrt(x² + y² + z²)

So, r² would be (1/4) * (x² + y² + z²). Therefore, to find r², we need to find x² + y² + z², and then divide by 4.

Our task then reduces to finding the minimum possible value of x² + y² + z² given the constraints on surface area and volume. Once we find that minimal sum, we can compute r² and then express it as a fraction.

So, how do we find the minimal value of x² + y² + z² given that xy + yz + xz = 27 and xyz = 23?

This seems like an optimization problem with constraints. I remember that Lagrange multipliers can be used for such problems, but maybe there's a way to use inequalities or other algebraic methods.

Let me think, perhaps using the method of Lagrange multipliers is the way to go here. Let's set up the problem.

We need to minimize f(x, y, z) = x² + y² + z².

Subject to the constraints:

g(x, y, z) = xy + yz + xz = 27,    (1)
h(x, y, z) = xyz = 23.              (2)

Since there are two constraints, we can use two Lagrange multipliers, say λ and μ, corresponding to each constraint.

The Lagrangian function would be:

L = x² + y² + z² - λ(xy + yz + xz - 27) - μ(xyz - 23)

Then, we take the partial derivatives of L with respect to x, y, z, λ, μ and set them equal to zero.

So, let's compute the partial derivatives.

∂L/∂x = 2x - λ(y + z) - μ(yz) = 0
∂L/∂y = 2y - λ(x + z) - μ(xz) = 0
∂L/∂z = 2z - λ(x + y) - μ(xy) = 0

And the constraints:

xy + yz + xz = 27,
xyz = 23.

So, we have a system of five equations with five variables: x, y, z, λ, μ.

This looks complicated, but maybe we can find some symmetry or substitution to simplify it.

Let me consider whether the minimal x² + y² + z² occurs when the box is a cube. Wait, but in a cube, all sides are equal, so x = y = z.

But let's check if that's possible. If x = y = z, then surface area would be 6x² = 54, so x² = 9, so x = 3. Then volume would be 3³ = 27. But the volume given is 23, which is less than 27. So, a cube isn't possible here because it can't satisfy both the surface area and volume constraints.

Therefore, the minimal x² + y² + z² occurs when the box isn't a cube, but perhaps when two sides are equal, making it a square prism or something like that. Alternatively, maybe all three sides are different.

But it's tricky. Let me try to think if there's a relation between x, y, z that can help me.

Looking back at the Lagrangian equations:

2x = λ(y + z) + μ(yz)     (3)
2y = λ(x + z) + μ(xz)     (4)
2z = λ(x + y) + μ(xy)     (5)

Hmm, perhaps we can subtract equations to find relations between variables.

Subtract equation (3) from equation (4):

2y - 2x = λ(x + z - y - z) + μ(xz - yz)
=> 2(y - x) = λ(x - y) + μ z (x - y)
Factor out (x - y):

2(y - x) = (x - y)(λ + μ z)
=> 2(y - x) = -(y - x)(λ + μ z)
Assuming y ≠ x, we can divide both sides by (y - x):

2 = -(λ + μ z)
=> λ + μ z = -2     (6)

Similarly, subtract equation (3) from equation (5):

2z - 2x = λ(x + y - y - z) + μ(xy - yz)
=> 2(z - x) = λ(x - z) + μ y (x - z)
Factor out (x - z):

2(z - x) = (x - z)(λ + μ y)
=> 2(z - x) = -(z - x)(λ + μ y)
Again, assuming z ≠ x:

2 = -(λ + μ y)
=> λ + μ y = -2     (7)

From equations (6) and (7), λ + μ z = λ + μ y, which implies that μ z = μ y.

If μ ≠ 0, then z = y.

So, if μ ≠ 0, then y = z.

Similarly, if we subtract equation (4) from equation (5):

2z - 2y = λ(x + y - x - z) + μ(xz - xy)
=> 2(z - y) = λ(y - z) + μ x (z - y)
Factor out (z - y):

2(z - y) = (y - z)(λ + μ x) = -(z - y)(λ + μ x)
Assuming z ≠ y:

2 = -(λ + μ x)
=> λ + μ x = -2     (8)

But from equation (6), we had λ + μ z = -2, and equation (8) gives λ + μ x = -2. So, μ z = μ x, which implies x = z if μ ≠ 0.

But earlier we had y = z, so if x = z, then all three variables are equal: x = y = z. But earlier, we saw that a cube isn't possible because the volume would be 27, not 23. So, that suggests that our assumption that μ ≠ 0 leads to a contradiction because it would require x = y = z, which doesn't satisfy the volume constraint.

Therefore, perhaps μ = 0.

If μ = 0, then equations (3), (4), and (5) become:

2x = λ(y + z)
2y = λ(x + z)
2z = λ(x + y)

Let me write these equations:

From (3): 2x = λ(y + z)
From (4): 2y = λ(x + z)
From (5): 2z = λ(x + y)

Since μ = 0, let's see if we can find a relationship here.

Let's denote S = x + y + z.

But maybe a better approach is to consider ratios.

From equation (3): 2x = λ(y + z)
From equation (4): 2y = λ(x + z)
Divide equation (3) by equation (4):

(2x)/(2y) = [λ(y + z)]/[λ(x + z)]
Simplify: x/y = (y + z)/(x + z)
Cross-multiplying: x(x + z) = y(y + z)
=> x² + xz = y² + yz
Rearranging: x² - y² = yz - xz
=> (x - y)(x + y) = z(y - x)
=> (x - y)(x + y + z) = 0

So, either x = y or x + y + z = 0. But since x, y, z are lengths, they must be positive, so x + y + z can't be zero. Therefore, x = y.

Similarly, by comparing equations (3) and (5), we can get another relation.

From (3): 2x = λ(y + z)
From (5): 2z = λ(x + y)
Divide (3) by (5):

(2x)/(2z) = [λ(y + z)]/[λ(x + y)]
Simplify: x/z = (y + z)/(x + y)
Again, x = y, so substitute:

x/z = (x + z)/(x + x) = (x + z)/(2x)

Cross-multiplying: x * 2x = z (x + z)
=> 2x² = x z + z²
Rearranging: 2x² - x z - z² = 0

This is a quadratic equation in terms of x:

2x² - x z - z² = 0

We can solve for x in terms of z:

x = [z ± sqrt(z² + 8 z²)] / 4 = [z ± sqrt(9 z²)] / 4 = [z ± 3 z]/4

Since x must be positive, we take the positive root:

x = (z + 3 z)/4 = 4 z /4 = z

or x = (z - 3 z)/4 = (-2 z)/4 = -z/2, which is negative, so discard.

Therefore, x = z. 

But earlier, we found that x = y, so now we have x = y = z.

Wait, that again suggests that the box is a cube, which isn't possible because the volume would have to be 27, but it's given as 23. That's a problem.

Hmm, that seems contradictory. So, maybe our earlier assumption that μ = 0 is incorrect? Or perhaps there's another way to approach this.

Wait, no. If x = y = z, then the constraints would be:

Surface area: 6x² = 54 => x² = 9 => x = 3, so volume would be 27, which is inconsistent with the given volume of 23. Therefore, x = y = z isn't a solution here. So, that suggests that our earlier approach might have a mistake or that perhaps the minimal sphere isn't achieved when x = y = z.

Wait, but perhaps μ isn't zero. Let me reconsider. We thought that if μ ≠ 0, then y = z and x = z, leading to x = y = z. But that's not acceptable.

Alternatively, perhaps the minimal sum x² + y² + z² occurs when two variables are equal, say, x = y, and the third is different. Let me try assuming that x = y, and see if that works.

Let me suppose that x = y. Then, let's denote x = y = a, and z = b.

So, our constraints become:

Surface area: 2(a² + a b + a b) = 2(a² + 2 a b) = 54 => a² + 2 a b = 27.       (9)

Volume: a * a * b = a² b = 23.                                                (10)

We need to find a² + a² + b² = 2a² + b².

Our goal is to minimize 2a² + b².

So, let's express b in terms of a from equation (10): b = 23 / a².

Substitute into equation (9):

a² + 2 a*(23 / a²) = 27
Simplify:

a² + (46 / a) = 27

Multiply both sides by a to eliminate the denominator:

a³ + 46 = 27a
=> a³ -27a +46 = 0

Hmm, now we have a cubic equation: a³ -27a +46 = 0.

Let me try to find the roots of this equation. Maybe rational roots? The possible rational roots are factors of 46 over factors of 1, so ±1, ±2, ±23, ±46.

Testing a=1: 1 -27 +46 = 20 ≠0

a=2: 8 -54 +46= 0 → 8 -54 is -46, plus 46 is 0. So, a=2 is a root.

Therefore, we can factor (a -2) from the cubic.

Using polynomial division or synthetic division:

Divide a³ -27a +46 by (a - 2):

Set up synthetic division:

2 | 1  0  -27  46
          2   4  -46
        1  2  -23  0

So, the cubic factors as (a -2)(a² + 2a -23) = 0.

Therefore, the roots are a=2, and the roots of a² +2a -23=0.

Solving a² +2a -23=0:

a = [-2 ± sqrt(4 +92)] /2 = [-2 ± sqrt(96)] /2 = [-2 ± 4 sqrt(6)] /2 = -1 ± 2 sqrt(6).

Since a must be positive, the other roots are a = -1 + 2 sqrt(6) ≈ -1 +4.898 ≈3.898, and a = -1 - 2 sqrt(6) which is negative, so discard.

So, possible positive roots are a=2 and a= -1 + 2 sqrt(6).

Now, let's compute b for each case.

Case 1: a=2.

Then, from equation (10), b=23/(2²)=23/4=5.75.

So, x = y =2, z=5.75.

Compute x² + y² + z²: 2*(2²) + (5.75)² = 2*4 + 33.0625 = 8 +33.0625=41.0625.

Which is 41.0625. As a fraction, that's 41 + 0.0625 = 41 + 1/16 = (656 +1)/16=657/16. So, r²= (657/16)/4=657/64.

Wait, no, wait. Wait, x² + y² + z² is 41.0625, so r² is (x² + y² + z²)/4=41.0625/4=10.265625, which is 657/64.

But let's check the other case.

Case 2: a= -1 + 2 sqrt(6) ≈3.898.

Compute b=23/(a²).

First, compute a²:

a= -1 + 2 sqrt(6). So, a +1 =2 sqrt(6). Squaring both sides: (a +1)^2=24.

Expand: a² +2a +1=24 → a² =24 -2a -1=23 -2a.

But a= -1 +2 sqrt(6), so 2a= -2 +4 sqrt(6).

So, a²=23 - (-2 +4 sqrt(6))=23 +2 -4 sqrt(6)=25 -4 sqrt(6).

Therefore, b=23/(25 -4 sqrt(6)).

To rationalize the denominator, multiply numerator and denominator by (25 +4 sqrt(6)):

b=23*(25 +4 sqrt(6))/[(25)^2 - (4 sqrt(6))^2] =23*(25 +4 sqrt(6))/(625 - 16*6)=23*(25 +4 sqrt(6))/(625 -96)=23*(25 +4 sqrt(6))/529.

Simplify denominator: 529=23².

So, b= [23*(25 +4 sqrt(6))]/23² = (25 +4 sqrt(6))/23.

So, b= (25 +4 sqrt(6))/23.

Now, let's compute x² + y² + z² for this case.

Since x = y = a, so 2a² + b².

We have a²=25 -4 sqrt(6) from earlier.

So, 2a²=2*(25 -4 sqrt(6))=50 -8 sqrt(6).

Then, b²= [(25 +4 sqrt(6))/23]^2.

Compute numerator: (25 +4 sqrt(6))²=25² + 2*25*4 sqrt(6) + (4 sqrt(6))²=625 + 200 sqrt(6) + 16*6=625 + 200 sqrt(6) +96=721 +200 sqrt(6).

Denominator:23²=529.

So, b²=(721 +200 sqrt(6))/529.

Therefore, x² + y² + z²=50 -8 sqrt(6) + (721 +200 sqrt(6))/529.

To combine these, let's express 50 -8 sqrt(6) as fractions over 529.

50 = (50 *529)/529=26450/529.

-8 sqrt(6)= (-8 sqrt(6)*529)/529= (-4232 sqrt(6))/529.

So, x² + y² + z²= [26450 -4232 sqrt(6) +721 +200 sqrt(6)]/529.

Combine like terms:

26450 +721=27171.

-4232 sqrt(6) +200 sqrt(6)= (-4032 sqrt(6)).

So, numerator=27171 -4032 sqrt(6).

Thus, x² + y² + z²=(27171 -4032 sqrt(6))/529.

We need to check whether this is smaller than the previous case of 657/16=41.0625.

Wait, 41.0625 is approximately 41.06, while let's compute the value here:

Numerator:27171 -4032 sqrt(6). Let's approximate sqrt(6)=2.449.

4032 *2.449 ≈4032*2.4=9676.8, plus 4032*0.049≈197.568, so total≈9676.8+197.568≈9874.368.

So, 27171 -9874.368≈17296.632.

Divide by 529: 17296.632/529≈32.73.

Wait, that's significantly smaller than 41.06. So, the minimal occurs when a= -1 +2 sqrt(6) and b=(25 +4 sqrt(6))/23.

So, that suggests that the minimal x² + y² + z² is (27171 -4032 sqrt(6))/529.

Wait, but let me verify the calculations to make sure.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating 2a² + b².

We had:

a²=25 -4 sqrt(6).

So, 2a²=2*(25 -4 sqrt(6))=50 -8 sqrt(6).

And b²=(25 +4 sqrt(6))² /23²=(625 +200 sqrt(6) +96)/529=(721 +200 sqrt(6))/529.

Thus, x² + y² + z²=50 -8 sqrt(6) + (721 +200 sqrt(6))/529.

Yes, that's correct. Then, expressing 50 -8 sqrt(6) over 529:

50 = (50 *529)/529= (26450)/529.

Similarly, -8 sqrt(6)= (-8 sqrt(6) *529)/529= (-4232 sqrt(6))/529.

Thus, summing everything:

(26450 -4232 sqrt(6) +721 +200 sqrt(6))/529.

26450 +721=27171.

-4232 sqrt(6) +200 sqrt(6)= -4032 sqrt(6).

So, numerator is 27171 -4032 sqrt(6).

Yes, that's correct.

So, x² + y² + z²=(27171 -4032 sqrt(6))/529.

Therefore, r²= [ (27171 -4032 sqrt(6))/529 ] /4= (27171 -4032 sqrt(6))/(529*4)= (27171 -4032 sqrt(6))/2116.

But wait, this seems messy. Maybe we can factor numerator and denominator?

Let me see: Let's factor numerator:

27171 -4032 sqrt(6).

Wait, 27171 and 4032, let's see if they have a common factor.

27171 divided by 3: 2+7+1+7+1=18, which is divisible by 3. 27171 ÷3=9057.

4032 ÷3=1344.

So, 3*(9057 -1344 sqrt(6)).

Denominator:2116=46².

Wait, 46=2*23, so 46²=4*529=4*23².

Wait, but numerator is 3*(9057 -1344 sqrt(6)).

Hmm, not sure if that helps, but maybe.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the assumption that x=y. Maybe the minimal occurs when all three variables are unequal.

Wait, but in that case, it's going to be complicated. Alternatively, perhaps the minimal sum x² + y² + z² for given surface area and volume is when variables are equal or when two are equal.

But in this case, when we assumed x=y, we found a solution that gives a smaller x² + y² + z² than the case when x=y=z (which isn't possible here). So, perhaps this is the minimal.

Wait, but let me check if this is indeed the minimal. Could there be a case where x≠y≠z and x² + y² + z² is even smaller?

It's hard to tell without doing more analysis. But perhaps given that in the symmetric case (x=y=z) isn't a solution here, the next best is the case where two variables are equal.

Alternatively, perhaps we can use the method of substitution without assuming x=y.

Wait, let me try another approach. Let's denote variables as x, y, z.

We have the surface area: xy + yz + xz=27, and volume xyz=23.

We need to minimize x² + y² + z².

Let me consider using the method of Lagrange multipliers again, but perhaps in a different way.

Let me consider the variables x, y, z, and use the method of symmetric equations.

Wait, when we set up the Lagrangian, we found that if μ≠0, then x=y=z, which isn't possible here. So, perhaps μ=0. Thus, when μ=0, earlier we found that x=y and x=z, implying x=y=z, which is not acceptable. So, maybe that suggests that the minimal isn't achieved under the assumption μ=0, which is confusing.

Alternatively, perhaps when μ=0, the minimal is achieved when x=y, but not necessarily x=z. Wait, earlier, when we set x=y, we found a solution. So, perhaps that is the minimal.

Since in the case x=y=2, z=23/4=5.75, we get x² + y² + z²=4+4+33.0625=41.0625.

But when x=(-1 + 2 sqrt(6))≈3.898, and z=(25 +4 sqrt(6))/23≈(25 +9.798)/23≈34.798/23≈1.513, then x² + y² + z²≈3.898² +3.898² +1.513²≈15.193 +15.193 +2.289≈32.675.

Which is significantly smaller than 41.0625. So, this seems better.

So, perhaps the minimal occurs when x=y= -1 +2 sqrt(6), which is approximately 3.898, and z=(25 +4 sqrt(6))/23≈1.513.

So, then, the minimal x² + y² + z² is (27171 -4032 sqrt(6))/529.

Wait, but how do we compute this? Let me compute both terms numerically.

Compute numerator: 27171 -4032*sqrt(6).

sqrt(6)≈2.44949.

4032*2.44949≈4032*2=8064, 4032*0.44949≈4032*0.4=1612.8; 4032*0.04949≈4032*0.05≈201.6. So total≈8064 +1612.8 +201.6≈8064+1814.4≈9878.4.

So, numerator≈27171 -9878.4≈17292.6.

Denominator:529.

So, x² + y² + z²≈17292.6 /529≈32.73.

Which is less than 41.06, so this is better.

So, that suggests that the minimal sum is indeed achieved when two variables are equal, and the third is different, as in the case when x=y= -1 +2 sqrt(6), z=(25 +4 sqrt(6))/23.

So, then, r²= (x² + y² + z²)/4= (27171 -4032 sqrt(6))/(529*4)= (27171 -4032 sqrt(6))/2116.

But let me try to write this fraction in the simplest terms.

First, let's compute numerator and denominator.

Numerator:27171 -4032 sqrt(6).

Denominator:2116.

But 2116=4*529=4*23².

I don't think the numerator and denominator have any common factors, but let's check.

27171 is the numerator without the sqrt(6) term. Let's see if 27171 and 2116 have a common factor.

2116=4*529=4*23².

27171 divided by 23: Let's compute 23*1181=27163, which is close to 27171. 27171-27163=8, so 27171=23*1181 +8. So, 27171 isn't divisible by 23.

Check divisibility by 3: 2+7+1+7+1=18, which is divisible by 3. 27171 ÷3=9057.

2116 ÷3: 2+1+1+6=10, not divisible by 3.

So, numerator is 3*(9057 -1344 sqrt(6)), denominator is 2116=4*529.

So, the fraction reduces to (9057 -1344 sqrt(6))/705.333... Hmm, maybe not helpful.

Alternatively, perhaps we can write 27171 -4032 sqrt(6) as 3*(9057 -1344 sqrt(6)).

But 9057 and 705.333 don't seem to have a common factor.

Wait, perhaps it's better to leave it as (27171 -4032 sqrt(6))/2116.

But the problem states that r² can be written as p/q where p and q are coprime positive integers. So, we need to express this as a fraction without radicals, which suggests that perhaps I made a mistake in the approach.

Wait, that can't be right because x² + y² + z² would involve sqrt(6). Wait, no, perhaps not. Maybe I made a miscalculation earlier.

Wait, actually, when we set up the problem assuming x=y, then we found x and z in terms of a, but perhaps there's a better substitution.

Alternatively, maybe I need to reconsider the initial approach.

Wait, perhaps another method: Using the AM ≥ GM inequality or other inequalities.

But since we have two constraints, surface area and volume, perhaps it's tricky.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use substitution.

Let me denote S = x + y + z, P = xy + yz + xz =27, V=xyz=23.

We need to find x² + y² + z² = S² - 2P = S² -54.

So, if we can express S in terms of P and V, maybe we can find S.

Wait, S² = (x + y + z)^2 = x² + y² + z² + 2(xy + yz + xz) = (x² + y² + z²) + 54.

But that's just restating the same thing.

Alternatively, perhaps using symmetric polynomials.

Wait, another thought: The problem resembles finding the minimal enclosing sphere for a set of points (rectangular boxes) defined by surface area and volume. So, perhaps the minimal sphere corresponds to the box where the space diagonal is minimized.

Thus, minimize sqrt(x² + y² + z²) given that 2(xy + yz + xz)=54 and xyz=23.

So, to minimize x² + y² + z², given the constraints.

Let me try using the method of substitution.

From the surface area constraint: xy + yz + xz=27.

Let me solve for one variable in terms of the others. Let's solve for z:

z = (27 - xy)/(x + y).

Then, substitute into the volume equation:

xyz=23 → x y [ (27 - xy)/(x + y) ]=23.

Let me denote t = xy.

Then, the equation becomes:

t*(27 - t)/(x + y)=23.

But x + y is another variable, say, s =x + y.

So, t*(27 - t)/s=23.

So, t*(27 - t)=23 s.

But t=xy, and s=x + y.

We also know that for two variables x and y, the maximum of t=xy is when x=y, but not sure if that helps.

Alternatively, perhaps express s in terms of t.

Wait, s² =x² + y² + 2xy= x² + y² + 2t.

But from earlier, x² + y² + z² = (x² + y²) + z²= (s² -2t) + z².

But z is expressed as (27 - t)/s.

So, z²= (27 - t)^2 / s².

Thus, x² + y² + z²= s² -2t + (27 - t)^2/s².

Our goal is to express this in terms of s and t, and find the minimal value.

But we also have t*(27 - t)=23 s.

Hmm, this seems getting complicated, but perhaps we can express everything in terms of s.

Let me try.

From t*(27 - t)=23 s, solve for t:

t² -27 t +23 s=0.

This is quadratic in t: t² -27 t +23 s=0.

Thus, discriminant D=729 -4*23 s=729 -92 s.

For real solutions, D≥0→729 -92 s≥0→s≤729/92≈7.9236.

So, s ≤7.9236.

Now, the solutions for t are:

t=(27 ± sqrt(729 -92 s))/2.

But t=xy must be positive, so both solutions may be acceptable if discriminant is positive.

But since t must be positive, and 27 is positive, both roots are positive as long as sqrt(729 -92 s) <27.

Which is true when 729 -92 s <729 → s>0, which it is.

So, t=(27 ± sqrt(729 -92 s))/2.

But since t=xy, and s=x+y, perhaps the smaller t is better.

Alternatively, perhaps we can express our expression for x² + y² + z² in terms of s.

We have:

x² + y² + z²= s² -2t + (27 -t)^2/s².

But t=(27 ± sqrt(729 -92 s))/2.

This seems too complicated. Maybe instead, let me consider that for fixed s, the expression x² + y² + z² is minimized when t is such that the derivative is zero, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to go back to the case where x=y, because when I assumed x=y, I found a valid solution, and the sum x² + y² + z² was 32.73, which is less than the case when x=y=z.

Thus, perhaps the minimal is achieved when x=y.

But then, let me check if that is indeed the minimal.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality or other inequalities.

Wait, perhaps I can use the following approach: For positive real numbers, we can relate the sum of squares to other symmetric sums.

We have:

(x + y + z)^2 = x² + y² + z² + 2(xy + yz + xz).

We know that xy + yz + xz=27, so:

(x + y + z)^2 = x² + y² + z² +54.

But we don't know x + y + z.

But perhaps from the volume, we can find some relation.

Alternatively, perhaps using the AM ≥ GM inequality on the terms x, y, z.

But given that xyz=23, and AM ≥ GM:

(x + y + z)/3 ≥ (xyz)^(1/3)=23^(1/3)≈2.843.

So, x + y + z≥3*2.843≈8.529.

But from earlier, when x=y= -1 +2 sqrt(6)≈3.898, z≈1.513, sum≈3.898+3.898+1.513≈9.309, which is greater than 8.529.

But I'm not sure if that helps.

Wait, another idea: Using the inequality between the arithmetic mean of squares and the geometric mean.

But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps using the following approach: Let me consider that x, y, z are real positive numbers satisfying the given constraints. We can model this as an optimization problem with two constraints.

Let me set up the Lagrangian again, but this time, perhaps with a different approach.

We have to minimize f(x,y,z)=x² + y² + z².

Subject to:

g(x,y,z)=xy + yz + xz=27,

h(x,y,z)=xyz=23.

Using Lagrange multipliers, we have the gradients:

∇f = [2x, 2y, 2z]

∇g = [y + z, x + z, x + y]

∇h = [yz, xz, xy]

So, the Lagrangian equations are:

2x = λ(y + z) + μ yz,

2y = λ(x + z) + μ xz,

2z = λ(x + y) + μ xy.

So, these are the same equations as before.

Earlier, we considered the cases where variables are equal, but that didn't work, leading to a cube which isn't valid.

Alternatively, perhaps we can express these equations in terms of ratios.

Divide the first equation by the second:

[2x]/[2y] = [λ(y+z) + μ yz]/[λ(x+z) + μ xz]

Simplify:

x/y = [λ(y+z) + μ yz]/[λ(x+z) + μ xz]

Cross-multiplying:

x [λ(x+z) + μ xz] = y [λ(y+z) + μ yz]

Similarly, this is getting complicated, but perhaps if we assume that x ≠ y, we can find a ratio.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to consider that two variables are equal, as we did before, x=y, and find that case gives a valid solution.

Thus, perhaps in this problem, the minimal is achieved when two variables are equal, which is the case we found earlier.

So, then, the minimal x² + y² + z² is (27171 -4032 sqrt(6))/529.

So, r²= (27171 -4032 sqrt(6))/(529*4)= (27171 -4032 sqrt(6))/2116.

But the problem says that r² can be written as p/q, where p and q are coprime positive integers. However, our current expression for r² has a sqrt(6) term, which is irrational, so this suggests that perhaps my approach is incorrect.

Wait, that can't be, because the minimal enclosing sphere must have a rational r²? Or perhaps not necessarily. Wait, the problem states that r² can be written as p/q, implying that it's a rational number.

But in my calculation, r² has an irrational component because of the sqrt(6). That suggests that perhaps my earlier assumption that x=y is invalid, or that there's a different approach needed.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the sum x² + y² + z².

Wait, let's go back.

We had x=y= -1 + 2 sqrt(6), which is approx 3.898.

So, x²= (-1 +2 sqrt(6))²=1 -4 sqrt(6) + 24=25 -4 sqrt(6).

So, x²=25 -4 sqrt(6).

Then, z=(25 +4 sqrt(6))/23.

So, z²= [(25 +4 sqrt(6))/23]^2.

Expanding numerator: 25² + 2*25*4 sqrt(6) + (4 sqrt(6))²=625 + 200 sqrt(6) + 96=721 +200 sqrt(6).

Denominator:23²=529.

So, z²=(721 +200 sqrt(6))/529.

Thus, x² + y² + z²= 2*(25 -4 sqrt(6)) + (721 +200 sqrt(6))/529.

Which is 50 -8 sqrt(6) + (721 +200 sqrt(6))/529.

So, expressed over 529:

(50*529 -8 sqrt(6)*529 +721 +200 sqrt(6))/529.

Compute numerator:

50*529=26450,

-8*529 sqrt(6)= -4232 sqrt(6),

+721,

+200 sqrt(6).

So, total numerator=26450 +721 + (-4232 sqrt(6) +200 sqrt(6))=27171 -4032 sqrt(6).

So, x² + y² + z²=(27171 -4032 sqrt(6))/529.

Thus, r²= (27171 -4032 sqrt(6))/(4*529)= (27171 -4032 sqrt(6))/2116.

But this is irrational, which contradicts the problem statement that r² can be written as p/q with p and q integers. Therefore, I must have made a mistake in my approach.

Wait, perhaps I didn't consider that when x=y, the minimal x² + y² + z² might not be the actual minimal. Maybe the minimal is achieved when all three variables are different, leading to a rational r².

Alternatively, perhaps I need to consider that the minimal sphere's radius squared is rational, so the expression I have with sqrt(6) must somehow cancel out, which doesn't seem likely.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the substitution.

Wait, when I set x=y=a, then the surface area equation became a² + 2 a b=27, and volume a² b=23.

Solving for b: b=23/a².

Substituting into surface area equation:

a² + 2a*(23/a²)=27 → a² +46/a=27.

Multiply both sides by a: a³ +46=27a → a³ -27a +46=0.

Factoring: (a-2)(a² +2a -23)=0.

So, a=2, and a= -1±2 sqrt(6).

So, in the case when a=2, then b=23/4=5.75, as we saw before, and x² + y² + z²=2*(4)+(5.75)^2=8 +33.0625=41.0625=657/16.

Thus, r²=657/(16*4)=657/64≈10.265625.

Wait, 657 and 64 are coprime, since 64 is 2^6, and 657 is odd. So, p=657, q=64, p+q=721.

But earlier, when I assumed a=-1 +2 sqrt(6), I got x² + y² + z²=(27171 -4032 sqrt(6))/529≈32.73, which is smaller than 41.06.

But that leads to an irrational r², which contradicts the problem's condition that r² is rational.

So, this suggests that the minimal occurs at a=2, giving r²=657/64, which is rational.

But then, why did the other case give a smaller sum? Perhaps because it's not actually feasible?

Wait, perhaps the case when a=-1 +2 sqrt(6)≈3.898, which is greater than 2, but when calculating the sum x² + y² + z², it's giving a smaller value, but the problem is that this leads to an irrational r², which isn't acceptable because the problem states that r² is a rational number p/q.

Therefore, perhaps the minimal enclosing sphere corresponds to the case when a=2, giving r²=657/64.

But why is the other case giving a smaller sum? Maybe that case is invalid because the sphere must enclose all boxes in the set B, not just one particular box.

Ah! That's a crucial point. The problem says that the sphere must contain each of the boxes in the set B. So, it's not just about finding the minimal sphere for one box, but a sphere that can contain any box in B.

So, perhaps the sphere must be large enough to contain all possible boxes satisfying the surface area and volume constraints. Therefore, we need to find the maximum of x² + y² + z² over all possible boxes in B, and then compute r² as (max(x² + y² + z²))/4.

So, in that case, the sphere's radius is determined by the box in B with the largest space diagonal, not the smallest.

That changes everything! So, I was thinking the opposite: I was trying to find the minimal enclosing sphere, but actually, since all boxes in B must be contained in the sphere, the sphere must have a radius equal to the maximum space diagonal among all boxes in B, divided by 2.

So, the problem is to find the maximum of x² + y² + z² over all boxes with surface area 54 and volume 23, and then r² is that maximum divided by 4.

Thus, I need to find the maximum of x² + y² + z² given 2(xy + yz + xz)=54 and xyz=23.

This is a different problem.

So, I need to maximize x² + y² + z² under the constraints.

So, going back, we can set up the Lagrangian again but this time for maximization.

But perhaps, in this case, the maximum occurs when two variables are as large as possible and the third is as small as possible, within the constraints.

Alternatively, perhaps using the method of Lagrange multipliers again, but perhaps the maximum occurs when one variable approaches zero, but given that xyz=23, which is fixed, variables can't be zero.

Alternatively, perhaps we can use the AM ≥ GM inequality.

Wait, but let me think.

We need to maximize x² + y² + z², given that xy + yz + xz=27 and xyz=23.

To maximize x² + y² + z², perhaps we can let one variable be as large as possible, making the other two as small as possible, but keeping the product xyz=23.

But let's see.

Let me consider that when one variable is large, say, z is large, then x and y must be small because xyz=23.

But in that case, the surface area would be xy + yz + xz=27.

If z is large, then yz and xz would dominate, so to keep the surface area at 27, x and y must adjust accordingly.

But perhaps the maximum occurs when two variables are equal, but not necessarily assuming x=y.

Alternatively, perhaps the maximum occurs when one variable is as large as possible, and the other two are equal.

Let me try assuming that x=y. Then, as before, we have:

x=y=a, z=b.

So, 2a² + 2ab=27,

and a² b=23.

From the volume equation, b=23/(a²).

Substitute into surface area:

2a² + 2a*(23/a²)=27 → 2a² +46/a=27.

Multiply by a: 2a³ +46=27a →2a³ -27a +46=0.

Wait, earlier with x=y=a, we had a³ -27a +46=0, but now it's 2a³ -27a +46=0.

Wait, no, earlier, in the minimization case, when I set x=y, the equation was a³ -27a +46=0, which had root a=2.

In this case, for the maximum, perhaps the equation is different.

Wait, no, this is the same equation as before. Because when I set x=y, regardless of whether I'm maximizing or minimizing, I end up with the same equations.

Wait, but that can't be. Because when I set x=y, I have to consider both possibilities for the third variable.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused.

Wait, no, both cases when maximizing and minimizing could occur under the same substitution, but perhaps for the maximum, the solution is different.

Wait, perhaps the maximum occurs at the case where x=y=2, z=23/4=5.75, giving x² + y² + z²=4 +4 +33.0625=41.0625=657/16.

But earlier, we found another solution when a= -1 +2 sqrt(6), which is approximately 3.898, giving x² + y² + z²≈32.73, which is smaller. So, perhaps the maximum occurs at a=2, giving sum 41.0625.

But wait, that's the case when a=2. Let me check if there's another case when a is different.

Wait, when we set x=y=a, we found that a can be 2 or approximately 3.898. So, perhaps the maximum occurs at a=2, giving the larger sum.

Alternatively, perhaps the maximum occurs when one variable is as large as possible, making the other two as small as possible.

Wait, but let's think: if we fix the product xyz=23, and the surface area xy + yz + xz=27, then making one variable larger would require the other two to be smaller to keep the product constant, but how does that affect the sum of squares?

Wait, let's consider the case where z is very large, then x and y would be small.

But then, to keep the surface area at 27, we have:

xy + yz + xz=27.

If z is very large, then yz and xz would be large, but we need their sum plus xy to be 27.

So, as z increases, y and x must decrease to keep yz + xz from exceeding 27.

But since xyz=23, if z increases, then x and y must decrease such that x y =23/z.

So, as z approaches infinity, x and y approach zero, but their product approaches zero as well, which contradicts xyz=23.

Wait, no. If z approaches infinity, then to keep xyz=23, either x or y must approach infinity, but that's not possible because then surface area would exceed 27.

Wait, perhaps the variables can't go to infinity because of the fixed surface area and volume.

Therefore, perhaps the maximum x² + y² + z² occurs at the boundary when one variable is as large as possible, and the other two are as small as possible while satisfying the constraints.

Alternatively, perhaps the maximum occurs at the case when two variables are equal, as we found earlier.

But when we set x=y=2, z=23/4=5.75, the sum x² + y² + z²=4 +4 +33.0625=41.0625=657/16.

When we set x=y= -1 +2 sqrt(6)≈3.898, z= (25 +4 sqrt(6))/23≈1.513, the sum is≈32.73, which is smaller.

So, perhaps the maximum occurs at x=y=2, giving sum=41.0625, which is 657/16.

Thus, r²=657/(16*4)=657/64.

Which is a rational number, as required.

Therefore, p=657, q=64. They are coprime because 657 ÷3=219, and 64 is 2^6, so no common factors.

Thus, p+q=657 +64=721.

Therefore, the answer is 721.


To solve the problem, we need to find the radius of the smallest sphere that can contain any rectangular box with a surface area of 54 and a volume of 23. The radius \( r \) of the sphere is half the space diagonal of the box, so we need to maximize the space diagonal \( \sqrt{x^2 + y^2 + z^2} \) over all such boxes. The value of \( r^2 \) will be \( \frac{x^2 + y^2 + z^2}{4} \).

Given the constraints:
1. Surface area: \( 2(xy + yz + xz) = 54 \) ⇒ \( xy + yz + xz = 27 \).
2. Volume: \( xyz = 23 \).

We aim to maximize \( x^2 + y^2 + z^2 \). 

Assuming two variables are equal, let \( x = y = a \) and \( z = b \). Then:
- Surface area: \( a^2 + 2ab = 27 \).
- Volume: \( a^2b = 23 \) ⇒ \( b = \frac{23}{a^2} \).

Substituting \( b \) into the surface area equation:
\[ a^2 + 2a \left( \frac{23}{a^2} \right) = 27 \]
\[ a^2 + \frac{46}{a} = 27 \]
Multiplying through by \( a \):
\[ a^3 - 27a + 46 = 0 \]

Solving this cubic equation, we find \( a = 2 \) is a root. Factoring:
\[ (a - 2)(a^2 + 2a - 23) = 0 \]

For \( a = 2 \), \( b = \frac{23}{2^2} = \frac{23}{4} = 5.75 \). The sum of squares is:
\[ x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = 2(2^2) + (5.75)^2 = 8 + 33.0625 = 41.0625 = \frac{657}{16} \]

For the other root \( a = -1 + 2\sqrt{6} \), the sum of squares yields a smaller value, but it results in an irrational \( r^2 \), which is invalid since \( r^2 \) must be rational.

Thus, the maximum \( x^2 + y^2 + z^2 \) is \( \frac{657}{16} \), and the radius squared is:
\[ r^2 = \frac{657}{16 \times 4} = \frac{657}{64} \]

Here, \( p = 657 \) and \( q = 64 \), which are coprime. Therefore, \( p + q = 657 + 64 = 721 \).

The final answer is:
\boxed{721}
