Okay, so I've got this math problem here about a 2x3 grid. The task is to figure out how many ways I can fill each cell with a digit (0-9) such that two conditions are met. First, when I read the grid left to right, the two numbers formed add up to 999. Second, when I read the grid top to bottom, the three numbers formed add up to 99. Hmm, that sounds a bit tricky, but let me break it down.

Let me visualize the grid. It's a 2x3 grid, so two rows and three columns. Let me assign variables to each cell to make it easier. I'll label the top row cells as A, B, C and the bottom row as D, E, F. So the grid looks like this:

A B C
D E F

Now, when reading left to right, the top row forms a three-digit number ABC, and the bottom row forms DEF. The sum of these two numbers should be 999. Wait, no, actually, in the example given, the top row is 0 0 8, which is 008 or just 8, and the bottom row is 9 9 1, which is 991. So 8 + 991 = 999. So actually, each row is a three-digit number. So ABC is a three-digit number, DEF is another three-digit number, and ABC + DEF = 999.

Similarly, when reading top to bottom, each column forms a two-digit number. So the first column is AD, the second is BE, and the third is CF. Their sum should be 99. So AD + BE + CF = 99.

Wait, let me make sure I get this right. The problem says "the sum of the three numbers formed by reading top to bottom is 99." So each column is a two-digit number. So for the example grid:
Top row: 0 0 8
Bottom row: 9 9 1
So columns are 09, 09, 81. 09 + 09 + 81 = 99. Okay, that's correct.

So the problem has two main equations:

1. ABC (top row) + DEF (bottom row) = 999
2. AD (first column) + BE (second column) + CF (third column) = 99

Each of A, B, C, D, E, F is a digit (0-9). Also, ABC and DEF are three-digit numbers, so A and D cannot be 0. Wait, actually, in the example, A is 0. Hmm, but in that case, ABC is 008, which is just 8, a single-digit number. So the problem doesn't specify that ABC and DEF must be three-digit numbers, but they can be any number formed by the digits. So leading zeros are allowed? That complicates things a bit.

Wait, but in the
