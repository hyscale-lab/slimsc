Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the number of triples of nonnegative integers (a, b, c) that satisfy two conditions: a + b + c = 300 and a²b + a²c + b²a + b²c + c²a + c²b = 6,000,000. Hmm, that's a bit of a mouthful. Let me break it down and see how I can approach it.

First, the first equation is straightforward: the sum of a, b, and c is 300. That suggests that a, b, and c are nonnegative integers adding up to 300. So, they could be zero or positive integers, but their total is fixed.

The second equation is a bit more complex. It says a²b + a²c + b²a + b²c + c²a + c²b = 6,000,000. Let me try to factor this expression to see if I can simplify it. 

Looking at the terms, I notice that each term is a product of two variables where one is squared and the other is linear. Let's see:

a²b + a²c can be factored as a²(b + c). Similarly, b²a + b²c can be written as b²(a + c), and c²a + c²b can be written as c²(a + b). So, putting it all together, the entire expression is a²(b + c) + b²(a + c) + c²(a + b).

Hmm, I wonder if there's a way to relate this to the first equation. Since a + b + c = 300, maybe I can express (b + c), (a + c), and (a + b) in terms of 300 - a, 300 - b, and 300 - c respectively.

So, substituting, the expression becomes:

a²(300 - a) + b²(300 - b) + c²(300 - c) = 6,000,000.

Let me write that down:

300a² - a³ + 300b² - b³ + 300c² - c³ = 6,000,000.

Hmm, that's interesting. Let me rearrange it:

300(a² + b² + c²) - (a³ + b³ + c³) = 6,000,000.

So, 300(a² + b² + c²) = 6,000,000 + (a³ + b³ + c³).

Dividing both sides by 300:

a² + b² + c² = 20,000 + (a³ + b³ + c³)/300.

Wait, that looks a bit messy. Maybe I should think differently.

I remember that for nonnegative integers, sometimes symmetry can be used. Since the equation is symmetric in a, b, c, perhaps we can assume some ordering, like a ≤ b ≤ c, and then count the number of solutions considering the symmetry. But that might complicate things because I'd have to consider all permutations.

Alternatively, maybe I can express everything in terms of just two variables using the first equation. Since a + b + c = 300, let's let c = 300 - a - b. Then, substitute c into the second equation.

So, substituting c:

The second equation becomes a²b + a²(300 - a - b) + b²a + b²(300 - a - b) + (300 - a - b)²a + (300 - a - b)²b = 6,000,000.

Whoa, that's a mouthful. Let me try to expand each term step by step.

First, let's compute each part:

1. a²b: That's straightforward.
2. a²c = a²(300 - a - b) = 300a² - a³ - a²b.
3. b²a = b²a.
4. b²c = b²(300 - a - b) = 300b² - a b² - b³.
5. c²a = (300 - a - b)²a. Let's expand (300 - a - b)²:
   (300)^2 - 2*300*(a + b) + (a + b)^2 = 90,000 - 600(a + b) + a² + 2ab + b².
   Multiply this by a:
   90,000a - 600a(a + b) + a³ + 2a²b + a b².
6. c²b = (300 - a - b)²b. Similarly, expanding:
   90,000b - 600b(a + b) + a²b + 2ab² + b³.

Now, let's sum all these terms:

Starting from term 1 to term 6:

Term1: a²b
Term2: 300a² - a³ - a²b
Term3: b²a
Term4: 300b² - a b² - b³
Term5: 90,000a - 600a² - 600ab + a³ + 2a²b + a b²
Term6: 90,000b - 600ab - 600b² + a²b + 2ab² + b³

Now, let's add them all up.

First, collect like terms:

1. a²b from term1
2. 300a² from term2
3. -a³ from term2
4. -a²b from term2
5. b²a from term3
6. 300b² from term4
7. -a b² from term4
8. -b³ from term4
9. 90,000a from term5
10. -600a² from term5
11. -600ab from term5
12. a³ from term5
13. 2a²b from term5
14. a b² from term5
15. 90,000b from term6
16. -600ab from term6
17. -600b² from term6
18. a²b from term6
19. 2ab² from term6
20. b³ from term6

Now, let's combine all these terms:

- a³ terms: -a³ (term2) + a³ (term5) = 0
- a²b terms: a²b (term1) - a²b (term2) + 2a²b (term5) + a²b (term6)
   = (1 -1 + 2 +1) a²b = 3a²b
- Similarly, a b² terms: b²a (term3) - a b² (term4) + a b² (term5) + 2ab² (term6)
   = (1 -1 +1 +2) a b² = 3a b²
- b³ terms: -b³ (term4) + b³ (term6) = 0
- a² terms: 300a² (term2) -600a² (term5) = -300a²
- b² terms: 300b² (term4) -600b² (term6) = -300b²
- a b terms: -600ab (term5) -600ab (term6) = -1200ab
- a terms: 90,000a (term5)
- b terms: 90,000b (term6)

Putting it all together:

3a²b + 3a b² - 300a² - 300b² - 1200ab + 90,000a + 90,000b = 6,000,000.

Hmm, that seems complicated. Maybe there's a better approach.

Wait, maybe instead of substituting c, I can consider using symmetric sums or some other identity.

Let me think about symmetric sums. Let me denote S1 = a + b + c = 300.

S2 = ab + bc + ca. Hmm, wait, maybe that can help.

Wait, let's recall that a^3 + b^3 + c^3 can be expressed in terms of S1, S2, and S3, where S3 = abc.

The formula is a³ + b³ + c³ = (a + b + c)^3 - 3(a + b + c)(ab + bc + ca) + 3abc.

So, a³ + b³ + c³ = S1³ - 3 S1 S2 + 3 S3.

Similarly, a²b + a²c + b²a + b²c + c²a + c²b is equal to (a + b + c)(ab + bc + ca) - 3abc = S1 S2 - 3 S3.

Wait, that seems promising. Let me check that.

Yes, because:

(a + b + c)(ab + bc + ca) = a(ab) + a(bc) + a(ca) + b(ab) + b(bc) + b(ca) + c(ab) + c(bc) + c(ca)

Simplify:

= a²b + a b c + a c² + a b² + b²c + b c a + c a b + c²b + c²a

Wait, but that's more terms than we have. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, actually, let's compute (a + b + c)(ab + bc + ca):

= a(ab + bc + ca) + b(ab + bc + ca) + c(ab + bc + ca)

= a²b + a bc + a²c + a b² + b²c + b c a + a c² + b c² + c²a.

Wait, that seems like a lot. Let me count the terms:

- a²b, a bc, a²c, a b², b²c, b c a, a c², b c², c²a.

Wait, so the total is:

a²b + a²c + a b² + b²c + a c² + c²a + 3abc.

But the original expression is a²b + a²c + b²a + b²c + c²a + c²b, which is the same as a²b + a²c + a b² + b²c + a c² + c²b. So, it's equal to (a + b + c)(ab + bc + ca) - 3abc.

Yes, because (a + b + c)(ab + bc + ca) gives us all the terms in the original expression plus 3abc.

So, a²b + a²c + b²a + b²c + c²a + c²b = (a + b + c)(ab + bc + ca) - 3abc.

So, the second equation can be written as:

S1 * S2 - 3 S3 = 6,000,000.

Where S1 = 300, S2 = ab + bc + ca, and S3 = abc.

So, substituting S1 = 300:

300 * S2 - 3 S3 = 6,000,000.

Divide both sides by 3:

100 S2 - S3 = 2,000,000.

So, 100 S2 - S3 = 2,000,000.

So, S3 = 100 S2 - 2,000,000.

Hmm, now we have expressions for S1, S2, and S3. Let me recall that for three variables, the elementary symmetric sums are S1, S2, S3. So, for a monic cubic polynomial with roots a, b, c, it would be x³ - S1 x² + S2 x - S3 = 0.

But I'm not sure if that helps directly. Alternatively, maybe we can find some constraints on S2.

Since a, b, c are nonnegative integers adding up to 300, we can find the possible range for S2.

But perhaps a better approach is to express S2 in terms of S3 or vice versa.

From S3 = 100 S2 - 2,000,000.

But since S3 is equal to abc, which is a nonnegative integer, 100 S2 - 2,000,000 must be nonnegative as well. Therefore, 100 S2 >= 2,000,000, so S2 >= 20,000.

Also, since a, b, c are nonnegative integers adding to 300, the maximum possible value of S2 occurs when two variables are as large as possible, and the third is as small as possible.

But let me think about the possible range of S2.

We can use the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality or AM-QM, but perhaps for the maximum of S2, it's when one variable is as large as possible, and the other two are as equal as possible.

Wait, for three variables with a fixed sum, S2 is maximized when two variables are equal and the third is as small as possible.

Wait, for example, if a = b = 150, c = 0, then S2 = 150*150 + 150*0 + 150*0 = 22,500.

But wait, 22,500 is less than 20,000? No, wait, hold on: 150^2 is 22,500, but 20,000 is the lower bound here, so S2 is 22,500, which is higher than 20,000.

Wait, but earlier I found that S2 must be >= 20,000 because S3 must be nonnegative. So, S2 must be between 20,000 and 22,500.

Wait, wait, wait, that doesn't make sense because if a = b = 150, c = 0, S2 = 22,500. But if all variables are equal, a = b = c = 100, then S2 = 100*100 + 100*100 + 100*100 = 30,000. Wait, that's higher than 22,500? No, 100*100 is 10,000, times 3 is 30,000. So, that's actually higher.

Wait, so perhaps when all variables are equal, S2 is maximized. Let me check.

Wait, S2 = ab + bc + ca. For a fixed sum a + b + c, S2 is maximized when a = b = c. Because the product terms are maximized when the variables are as equal as possible.

So, maximum S2 occurs at a = b = c = 100, so S2 = 3*(100*100) = 30,000.

The minimum S2 occurs when one variable is as large as possible, and the other two are zero. For example, a = 300, b = c = 0: S2 = 0 + 0 + 0 = 0. But wait, that's contradictory to our earlier conclusion that S2 must be >=20,000 because of S3 >=0.

Wait, but in our case, S3 = 100 S2 - 2,000,000.

So, S3 >=0 implies that 100 S2 - 2,000,000 >=0, so S2 >=20,000.

So, the lower bound for S2 is 20,000, and the upper bound is 30,000.

So, S2 must be between 20,000 and 30,000, inclusive. So, 20,000 <= S2 <=30,000.

But S3 = 100 S2 - 2,000,000. So, when S2 is 20,000, S3 is 0. When S2 is 30,000, S3 is 100*30,000 - 2,000,000 = 3,000,000 - 2,000,000 = 1,000,000.

So, S3 can be between 0 and 1,000,000.

But S3 is abc, which is nonnegative. So, our constraints are 20,000 <= S2 <=30,000, and S3=100 S2 - 2,000,000.

Now, our problem reduces to finding the number of triples (a, b, c) such that a + b + c =300, and S2 and S3 satisfy the above conditions.

But how do we connect this with the equations?

We have:

a + b + c = 300.

ab + bc + ca = S2.

abc = S3 = 100 S2 - 2,000,000.

So, for each possible S2 in [20,000; 30,000], we can compute S3, and then find the number of triples (a, b, c) such that a + b + c =300, ab + bc + ca = S2, and abc = S3.

But this seems complicated because S2 can vary, and for each S2, we have a different S3.

Alternatively, perhaps we can find a relationship between S2 and S3 and find a way to compute the number of triples.

Alternatively, maybe we can parametrize S2 and S3 in terms of variables.

Wait, maybe think of (a, b, c) as roots of a cubic equation.

The monic cubic equation with roots a, b, c is x³ - S1 x² + S2 x - S3 =0, which is x³ - 300 x² + S2 x - (100 S2 -2,000,000)=0.

So, the equation is x³ - 300 x² + S2 x - (100 S2 - 2,000,000) =0.

But I'm not sure how to proceed from here.

Wait, perhaps I can factor this equation.

Let me write it as x³ - 300 x² + S2 x - 100 S2 + 2,000,000 =0.

Hmm, maybe factor by grouping:

Take x³ - 300 x² + S2 x - 100 S2 + 2,000,000.

Group as (x³ - 300 x²) + (S2 x - 100 S2) + 2,000,000.

Factor out x² from the first group: x²(x - 300) + S2(x - 100) + 2,000,000 =0.

Hmm, not sure if that helps.

Alternatively, maybe write it as x³ - 300 x² + S2(x - 100) + 2,000,000 =0.

But I don't see an obvious way to factor this.

Alternatively, perhaps we can write the equation as:

x³ - 300x² + S2 x -100 S2 +2,000,000=0.

Let me factor S2:

x³ -300x² + S2(x -100) +2,000,000=0.

Hmm, but not particularly helpful.

Wait, maybe let me consider S2 as a variable and try to see if the equation can be factored in terms of S2.

Alternatively, perhaps set x = 100, let's see if that's a root.

Plugging x=100 into the equation:

100³ -300*100² + S2*100 -100 S2 +2,000,000.

Calculate each term:

100³ = 1,000,000.

300*100² = 300*10,000 = 3,000,000.

So, 1,000,000 - 3,000,000 = -2,000,000.

Then, S2*100 -100 S2 =0.

So, total: -2,000,000 +2,000,000=0.

So, x=100 is a root!

So, (x -100) is a factor. Let's perform polynomial division.

Divide the cubic by (x -100):

Using synthetic division:

Coefficients: 1 (x³), -300 (x²), S2 (x), (-100 S2 +2,000,000) (constant term).

Set up synthetic division with root 100:

Bring down 1.

Multiply 1 by 100: 100. Add to -300: -200.

Multiply -200 by 100: -20,000. Add to S2: S2 -20,000.

Multiply (S2 -20,000) by 100: 100 S2 - 2,000,000. Add to (-100 S2 +2,000,000):

100 S2 -2,000,000 -100 S2 +2,000,000 =0.

So, the cubic factors as (x -100)(x² -200x + (S2 -20,000)).

Therefore, the equation becomes:

(x -100)(x² -200x + (S2 -20,000))=0.

So, the other roots are solutions to x² -200x + (S2 -20,000)=0.

So, the roots are 100, and the roots of x² -200x + (S2 -20,000)=0.

So, the roots of the quadratic are [200 ± sqrt(40,000 -4*(S2 -20,000))]/2.

Simplify discriminant:

sqrt(40,000 -4 S2 +80,000) = sqrt(120,000 -4 S2) = sqrt(4*(30,000 - S2)) ) = 2 sqrt(30,000 - S2).

So, the roots are [200 ± 2 sqrt(30,000 - S2)]/2 = 100 ± sqrt(30,000 - S2).

Therefore, the roots are:

100 + sqrt(30,000 - S2),

100 - sqrt(30,000 - S2),

and 100.

So, the roots are 100, and 100 ± sqrt(30,000 - S2).

Since a, b, c are nonnegative integers, the roots must be nonnegative integers as well.

So, 100 + sqrt(30,000 - S2) and 100 - sqrt(30,000 - S2) must be integers.

Let me denote t = sqrt(30,000 - S2). Then, t must be an integer because 30,000 - S2 must be a perfect square.

So, t is integer, and S2 =30,000 - t².

So, S2 must be 30,000 minus a perfect square.

But earlier, we have S2 >=20,000.

So, 30,000 - t² >=20,000 => t² <=10,000 => t <=100.

So, t can be 0,1,2,...,100.

But, additionally, since a, b, c are nonnegative integers, the roots must be nonnegative integers.

So, the roots are 100 + t, 100 - t, and 100.

But since 100 - t must be nonnegative, t <=100.

Which is already satisfied as t <=100.

So, the three roots are 100 + t, 100 - t, and 100.

But since roots can be in any order, the triple (a, b, c) can be any permutation of (100 + t, 100 - t, 100).

But wait, since t can be from 0 to100, but also, 100 - t must be nonnegative. So, t can be 0,1,2,...,100.

So, for each t in 0 to100, we have a unique set of roots {100 + t, 100, 100 - t}.

Therefore, the triple (a, b, c) is a permutation of these three numbers.

Now, the number of such triples depends on whether the numbers are distinct or not.

Case 1: t=0.

Then, all three roots are 100, so the triple is (100,100,100). There's only 1 such triple.

Case 2: t>0.

Then, the numbers are 100 + t, 100, and 100 - t. Since t is positive and less than or equal to100, 100 - t can be 0 or positive.

But wait, 100 - t must be nonnegative, so t can be 0 to100.

But if t=100, then 100 - t=0, so the roots are 200,100,0.

So, for each t from 1 to100, we have a triple {100 + t, 100, 100 - t}.

Now, for each such t, how many distinct triples (a, b, c) do we have?

If all three numbers are distinct, then the number of permutations is 6.

If two numbers are the same, the number is fewer.

But in our case, for t>0, 100 + t, 100, and 100 - t are all distinct as long as t ≠0.

Because 100 + t ≠100, 100 - t ≠100 as long as t≠0.

Also, 100 + t and 100 - t are distinct unless t=0.

So, for each t from1 to100, the numbers are distinct, so each such t contributes 6 triples.

But wait, when t=0, all numbers are same, so only 1 triple.

But let's see when t=100:

Numbers are 200,100,0. All distinct, so 6 permutations.

Similarly, when t=1, numbers are 101,100,99: all distinct, so 6 permutations.

But wait, wait a second: when t=50, numbers are 150,100,50: all distinct, so 6 permutations.

So, for t=1 to100, each t gives 6 triples.

But wait, when t=0, we have (100,100,100): only 1 triple.

So, total number of triples would be 1 + 6*100=601.

But wait, this can't be right because the problem is about nonnegative integers, so 0 is allowed.

Wait, but wait, a, b, c must be nonnegative integers, and in our case, when t=100, 100 -t=0 is allowed.

So, all the t from1 to100 are valid, each giving 6 triples.

But hold on, let me check for t=50: 150,100,50. Their sum is 150+100+50=300. Correct.

So, each t gives a valid triple.

But wait, what about when t=100: 200,100,0. The sum is 300.

Yes, correct.

So, in total, for t=0, we have 1 triple.

For t=1 to100, each t gives 6 triples.

So, total number of triples is 1 + 6*100=601.

But wait, but is that correct?

Wait, but 100 + t + 100 + (100 -t) = 300, which is correct.

But in the problem statement, we have a, b, c as nonnegative integers, so when t=100, 100 - t=0 is allowed.

So, all the triples are valid.

But let me think again: for each t from1 to100, there are 6 permutations, but if some of the numbers are equal, the number of permutations would be less.

But in our case, for t>0, all three numbers are distinct, so each t gives 6 distinct triples.

Therefore, the total number is 1 + 6*100=601.

But wait, the problem says "the number of triples of nonnegative integers (a, b, c)".

But wait, in our case, when t=0, we have (100,100,100), which is just 1 triple.

For t from1 to100, each t gives 6 triples.

So, total is 1 + 6*100=601.

But wait, wait, the problem is not over yet. Because the second equation is about a²b + a²c + ... =6,000,000.

But in our analysis, we found that for each t, the second equation is satisfied because we derived S2 and S3 such that the equations are satisfied.

So, all these triples satisfy both equations.

Therefore, the number of such triples is 601.

But wait, wait a minute. Let me double-check.

Wait, when t=0, the triple is (100,100,100). Let's compute the second equation:

a²b + a²c + b²a + b²c + c²a + c²b.

Each term is 100² *100 = 1,000,000. There are 6 terms, so total is 6,000,000. Correct.

For t=1: (101,100,99).

Compute a²b + a²c + b²a + b²c + c²a + c²b.

Compute each term:

a=101, b=100, c=99.

a²b =101²*100=10,201*100=1,020,100.

a²c=101²*99=10,201*99=1,009,899.

b²a=100²*101=10,000*101=1,010,000.

b²c=100²*99=990,000.

c²a=99²*101=9,801*101=989,901.

c²b=99²*100=9,801*100=980,100.

Adding them up:

1,020,100 + 1,009,899 =2,030,  let me compute each step:

1,020,100 +1,009,899= 2,030, 100+899=999, so total 2,030, 100+899=999? Wait, no, 1,020,100 +1,009,899 = 2,030, 100 +899=999? Wait, that's 2,030, (100+899) =2,030, 999? Wait, no, that's not right. Wait, 1,020,100 +1,009,899 is 2,030, 100+899=999, but actually, 1,020,100 +1,009,899 = 2,029,999.

Wait, perhaps I should compute each term step by step.

Wait, 1,020,100 +1,009,899 = 2,030, 100 + 899= 2,030, 999?

Wait, 1,020,100 is 1,020 thousands and 100. 1,009,899 is 1,009 thousands and 899. So adding together: 1,020,100 +1,009,899 = (1,020,000 +1,009,000) + (100 +899) = 2,029,000 +999=2,029,999.

Similarly, b²a=1,010,000; b²c=990,000.

Adding these: 1,010,000 +990,000=2,000,000.

c²a=989,901; c²b=980,100.

Adding these: 989,901 +980,100=1,970,001.

Now, total sum is 2,029,999 +2,000,000 +1,970,001.

Compute 2,029,999 +2,000,000=4,029,999. Then +1,970,001=6,000,000.

Yes! So, the second equation is satisfied.

So, for t=1, the sum is correct.

Similarly, for t=100, the triple is (200,100,0). Let's compute the second equation:

a=200, b=100, c=0.

Compute a²b=200²*100=40,000*100=4,000,000.

a²c=200²*0=0.

b²a=100²*200=10,000*200=2,000,000.

b²c=100²*0=0.

c²a=0²*200=0.

c²b=0²*100=0.

Adding them: 4,000,000 +0 +2,000,000 +0 +0 +0=6,000,000. Correct.

So, in all cases, the second equation is satisfied.

Thus, all the triples generated by t from0 to100 are valid.

Therefore, the total number of triples is 1 (for t=0) +6*100=601.

Wait, but hold on: when t=0, the triple is (100,100,100). How many permutations are there? Just 1, since all are the same.

For t=1 to100, each t generates 6 distinct permutations because all three numbers are distinct. So, for each t, 6 triples.

So, total triples=1 +6*100=601.

But wait, the problem asks for the number of triples. So, 601 is the answer?

Wait, but let me check for possible overcounting. For example, when t=50, the triple is (150,100,50). Are there any other triples that might satisfy the equations but are not captured by this parametrization?

Wait, let me think: Since we derived that all solutions must come from t=0 to100, each giving a unique set of roots, and each such set corresponds to a unique triple (up to permutation), I don't think there are any other solutions.

Therefore, the answer is 601.

But wait, let me think again. When t=50, the triple is (150,100,50). But are there any other triples that could satisfy the two equations without being in this form?

I don't think so because we derived that the only possible solutions are the ones where two variables are 100 ± t and the third is 100. So, all solutions are accounted for.

Therefore, the number of triples is 601.


The number of triples is 601.

$\boxed{601}$
