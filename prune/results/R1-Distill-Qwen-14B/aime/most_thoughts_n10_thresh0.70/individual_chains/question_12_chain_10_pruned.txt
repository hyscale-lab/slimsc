Okay, so I have this math problem here about a 2x3 grid. I need to figure out how many ways I can fill each cell with a digit (0 through 9) such that two conditions are met. First, when I read the grid left to right, the two numbers formed should add up to 999. Second, when I read the grid top to bottom, the three numbers formed should add up to 99. The example given is a grid where the top row is 0, 0, 8, and the bottom row is 9, 9, 1. This works because 008 + 991 = 999 and 9 + 9 + 81 = 99. Cool, that makes sense.

Hmm, let me try to visualize the grid. It's two rows and three columns. Let's label the cells as follows:

Top row: A, B, C

Bottom row: D, E, F

So, the two numbers formed left to right would be ABC and DEF. Their sum should be 999. So, ABC + DEF = 999.

And the three numbers formed top to bottom would be AD, BE, CF. Their sum should be 99. So, AD + BE + CF = 99.

Wait, no. Wait, top to bottom, each column is a number. So, the numbers are AD, BE, CF? Or is it A followed by D, which would be a two-digit number? Wait, the example says 008 + 991 = 999. So, the top row is 008, which is a three-digit number, and the bottom row is 991, another three-digit number. Then, top to bottom, each column is a two-digit number: 09, 09, 81. Their sum is 09 + 09 + 81 = 99. So yes, each column is a two-digit number, formed by the top digit and the bottom digit in each column.

So, the grid has two rows and three columns, and each cell is a single digit. So, each cell can be 0-9.

So, the first condition is that the top row, ABC, and the bottom row, DEF, add up to 999. So, ABC + DEF = 999.

The second condition is that each column's top and bottom digits form a two-digit number, and when you add all three of those two-digit numbers, you get 99. So, (A D) + (B E) + (C F) = 99.

Wait, but how are the two-digit numbers formed? It's the top digit first, then the bottom digit. So, for the first column, it's A followed by D, which is 10*A + D. Similarly, the second column is 10*B + E, third is 10*C + F. So, adding them together: (10A + D) + (10B + E) + (10C + F) = 99.

Which can be rewritten as 10(A + B + C) + (D + E + F) = 99.

Okay, so that's one equation. The other equation is ABC + DEF = 999.

Let me think about the first equation: ABC + DEF = 999.

Since ABC and DEF are three-digit numbers, their sum is 999. So, ABC = 999 - DEF.

The second equation: 10(A + B + C) + (D + E + F) = 99.

Hmm. I can maybe relate these two equations.

Let me expand ABC and DEF as numbers. ABC is 100*A + 10*B + C. DEF is 100*D + 10*E + F.

So, ABC + DEF = 100A + 10B + C + 100D + 10E + F = 999.

Which can be written as 100(A + D) + 10(B + E) + (C + F) = 999.

So, 100(A + D) + 10(B + E) + (C + F) = 999.

But let me look at the other equation: 10(A + B + C) + (D + E + F) = 99.

Let me denote S = A + B + C, and T = D + E + F.

So, the second equation becomes 10S + T = 99. Therefore, T = 99 - 10S.

So, T = D + E + F = 99 - 10S.

But from the first equation, 100(A + D) + 10(B + E) + (C + F) = 999.

Let me denote:

Let me call U = A + D

V = B + E

W = C + F

So, 100U + 10V + W = 999.

But also, S = A + B + C, and T = D + E + F. So, S + T = (A + B + C) + (D + E + F) = (A + D) + (B + E) + (C + F) = U + V + W.

So, U + V + W = S + T.

But T = 99 - 10S, so U + V + W = S + (99 - 10S) = 99 - 9S.

Now, we have 100U + 10V + W = 999.

Also, U + V + W = 99 - 9S.

Hmm, not sure if that's helpful yet.

Let me think about the digits. Each digit A, B, C, D, E, F is between 0 and 9. So, U = A + D can be from 0 to 18. Similarly for V and W.

So, 100U + 10V + W is 999. Let me write 999 as 999. So, 100U + 10V + W = 999.

We can think of this as a three-digit number U V W = 999. Wait, but U, V, W are sums of digits, not digits themselves. So, it's like a three-digit number where each digit is a sum of two digits from the grid.

Wait, but 999 is 999, so let's see:

We can write 999 as 100*9 + 10*9 + 9.

So, U = 9, V = 9, W = 9.

Wait, is that possible?

Wait,
