Okay, so I've got this problem where Alice picks a set A of positive integers. Then Bob lists all finite nonempty sets B of positive integers such that the maximum element of B is in A. And it's given that Bob's list has 2024 sets. I need to find the sum of the elements of A. Hmm, let me try to break this down.

First, let me make sure I understand the problem correctly. Alice chooses a set A, which is a set of positive integers. So A can be something like {1, 2, 3} or {5, 10}, whatever. Then Bob is creating a list of all possible finite, nonempty sets B where the maximum element of B is in A. So for each B, the largest number in B has to be in A. Then the total number of such sets B is 2024.

So, the question is asking for the sum of the elements of A. That would be, for example, if A is {1,2,3}, the sum would be 6.

I think the key here is to figure out how many sets B exist for a given set A, and then set that equal to 2024 and solve for A.

So let's think about how Bob constructs his list. Each set B must be a finite nonempty set of positive integers with max(B) in A. So for each element a in A, we can consider all sets B where the maximum is a. Then the total number of such sets is the sum over each a in A of the number of sets where max(B) is a.

Wait, that makes sense. So for each a in A, the number of sets B with max(B) = a is equal to the number of non-empty subsets of {1, 2, ..., a-1} multiplied by 1 (since the set must include a and can include any combination of smaller numbers). But wait, no, actually, the set B can include any numbers from 1 up to a, but with the condition that the maximum is a. So, the set B must contain a, and any subset of {1, 2, ..., a-1}. But since B is non-empty, and a is the maximum, the subsets of {1, 2, ..., a-1} can be any subset, including the empty set, but then adding a gives a non-empty set. So the number of such sets for each a is 2^{a-1}.

Wait, let's verify that. For a given a, the number of sets B with max(B) = a is equal to the number of subsets of {1, 2, ..., a-1}, because for each subset S of {1, 2, ..., a-1}, we can form the set S ∪ {a}, which will have max a. Including the empty set, which gives just {a}. So the number is indeed 2^{a-1}.

Therefore, the total number of sets B is the sum over each a in A of 2^{a-1}. Because for each a, there are 2^{a-1} sets B with maximum a.

So, if we let |A| be the number of elements in A, and if A is {a1, a2, ..., an} where a1 < a2 < ... < an}, then the total number of sets is 2^{a1 - 1} + 2^{a2 - 1} + ... + 2^{an - 1} = 2024.

Wait, but wait, actually, no. Wait, 2^{a-1} for each a in A. So the sum is Σ_{a ∈ A} 2^{a - 1} = 2024.

So our goal is to find A such that the sum of 2^{a-1} over all a in A is 2024, and then compute the sum of elements in A.

So the problem reduces to finding a set A where the sum of 2^{a-1} for each a in
