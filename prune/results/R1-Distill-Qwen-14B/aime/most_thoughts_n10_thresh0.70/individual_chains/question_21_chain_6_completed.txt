Okay, so I'm trying to solve this problem where I need to find the smallest integer base b (where b is at least 2) such that there are more than ten b-eautiful numbers. Let me try to break down what this means.

First, let's make sure I understand the definition correctly. A positive integer n is called b-eautiful if two conditions are satisfied:

1. When n is written in base b, it has exactly two digits. So, in base b, n would be represented as a two-digit number, say, d₁d₀. Here, d₁ is the digit in the b's place, and d₀ is the units place.

2. The sum of these two digits (d₁ + d₀) equals the square root of n. So, d₁ + d₀ = sqrt(n).

Given that, I need to find the smallest b where there are more than ten such numbers n.

Let me start by translating the two-digit number in base b into its decimal equivalent. A two-digit number d₁d₀ in base b is equal to d₁ * b + d₀ in decimal. So, n = d₁ * b + d₀.

According to the second condition, the sum of the digits is equal to the square root of n. So, sqrt(n) = d₁ + d₀.

Squaring both sides, we get n = (d₁ + d₀)^2.

But since n is also equal to d₁ * b + d₀, we can set these equal:

d₁ * b + d₀ = (d₁ + d₀)^2.

Let me write this equation again:

d₁ b + d₀ = (d₁ + d₀)^2.

I need to find integers d₁ and d₀ such that this holds, with the constraints that d₁ and d₀ are digits in base b. So, d₁ can be from 1 to b-1 (since it's the leading digit), and d₀ can be from 0 to b-1.

So, for each base b, I can iterate through possible values of d₁ and d₀, compute the right-hand side (RHS) as (d₁ + d₀)^2, and check if it equals d₁*b + d₀. If it does, then that n is a b-eautiful number.

But since I'm looking for the minimal b where there are more than ten such n's, I need a way to count how many pairs (d₁, d₀) satisfy this equation for each b.

Let me rearrange the equation to see if I can find a relationship between d₁ and d₀.

Starting from:

d₁ b + d₀ = (d₁ + d₀)^2.

Let me denote s = d₁ + d₀. Then, the equation becomes:

d₁ b + d₀ = s².

But since s = d₁ + d₀, I can write d₀ = s - d₁. Substituting into the equation:

d₁ b + (s - d₁) = s².

Simplify:

d₁ b + s - d₁ = s².

Factor out d₁:

d₁ (b - 1) + s = s².

Rearranging:

d₁ (b - 1) = s² - s.

So,

d₁ = (s² - s) / (b - 1).

Hmm, interesting. Since d₁ must be an integer between 1 and b-1, (s² - s) must be divisible by (b -1), and the result must be an integer within that range.

Let me note that s is the sum of digits d₁ and d₀, and since d₁ is at least 1 and d₀ is at least 0, s is at least 1. Also, since d₁ is at most b-1 and d₀ is at most b-1, s is at most (b-1) + (b-1) = 2b - 2.

So, s ranges from 1 to 2b-2.

But wait, actually, since d₀ can be up to b-1 and d₁ can be up to b-1, but since n is a two-digit number, d₁ must be at least 1, so s ranges from 1 + 0 = 1 to (b-1) + (b-1) = 2b-2.

But let's think about s. The equation we have is n = s², and n is a two-digit number in base b, so n must satisfy:

b ≤ n < b².

Because a two-digit number in base b is at least b (when d₁=1, d₀=0) and less than b^2 (which is the next three-digit number in base b).

But n is equal to s squared, so:

b ≤ s² < b².

Taking square roots (since all terms are positive):

sqrt(b) ≤ s < b.

So, s is an integer in the range [sqrt(b), b).

This gives me a more precise range for s. So s starts from the ceiling of sqrt(b) up to b-1, because s has to be less than b. So s ranges from ceil(sqrt(b)) to b-1, inclusive.

Wait, but if s has to be an integer, then yes, s can be from ceil(sqrt(b)) to b-1. So for each s in that range, we can compute d₁ as (s² - s)/(b -1), and if that d₁ is an integer between 1 and b-1, then d₀ = s - d₁ is between 0 and b-1, so that's a valid digit.

So for each base b, I can compute the number of valid s values, and for each s, check if (s² - s) is divisible by (b-1), and if the resulting d₁ is within the valid range. If so, then that s contributes to a b-eautiful number.

So, for each base b, the number of b-eautiful numbers is equal to the number of s in [ceil(sqrt(b)), b-1] such that (s² - s) is divisible by (b-1), and the resulting d₁ is between 1 and b-1.

But perhaps I can find a way to count the number of solutions for each b without having to iterate through each possible s.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to find for each b what the possible s can be, and then find how many pairs (d₁, d₀) correspond to each s.

Wait, but maybe I can model this as a quadratic in s.

Looking back, the equation is:

d₁ = (s² - s)/(b - 1).

Since d₁ must be an integer between 1 and b-1, (s² - s) must be divisible by (b -1), and the quotient must be in that range.

Alternatively, perhaps I can see this as:

s² - s ≡ 0 mod (b -1).

So, s² ≡ s mod (b -1), which implies that s(s - 1) ≡ 0 mod (b -1).

So, for each s, s(s - 1) must be divisible by (b -1).

Therefore, for a given b, the number of s in [ceil(sqrt(b)), b -1] such that s(s -1) is divisible by (b -1).

Hmm, that's an interesting point. So, (b -1) must divide s(s -1). Since s and s-1 are consecutive integers, they are coprime. Therefore, (b -1) must divide the product s(s-1), and since s and s-1 are coprime, (b -1) must divide s or (b -1) must divide s-1, or (b -1) is a product of factors from s and s-1.

Wait, but since s and s-1 are coprime, any divisor of their product must divide either s or s-1. So, for (b-1) to divide s(s-1), (b-1) must be a product of factors where each prime factor is entirely in s or entirely in s-1.

So, in other words, (b -1) must be of the form d * e, where d divides s and e divides s-1, and d and e are coprime.

Alternatively, perhaps (b -1) must be a divisor of s(s - 1), which is a product of two consecutive integers, hence coprime.

Therefore, for each b, the possible s are such that s ≡0 mod k or s ≡1 mod k, where k is a divisor of (b -1).

Wait, perhaps not exactly. Let me think.

If (b -1) divides s(s -1), then each prime factor of (b -1) must divide either s or s -1. So, if I factor (b -1) into its prime factors, for each prime power in (b -1), it must be entirely in s or entirely in s -1.

So, for example, suppose (b -1) = p^k * q^m, where p and q are distinct primes. Then s must be congruent to 0 mod p^k and 0 mod q^m, or s must be congruent to 1 mod p^k and 1 mod q^m, or any combination where each prime power divides either s or s -1.

But since (b -1) is fixed, perhaps the number of solutions s is related to the number of divisors of (b -1).

Wait, perhaps another approach: For each b, let's denote m = b -1. So, m = b -1.

We have that m divides s(s -1).

So, for each m, the number of s in [ceil(sqrt(b)), b -1] such that m divides s(s -1).

Since m = b -1, and s ranges from ceil(sqrt(b)) to m, because s is less than b.

Wait, because s must be less than b, as s is the sum of two digits in base b, each less than b.

Wait, no, s is at most (b-1) + (b-1) = 2b - 2, but earlier, we found that s must be less than b because n = s² is less than b², but n is a two-digit number in base b, so n must be at least b, so s must be at least sqrt(b), but s can be up to less than b.

Wait, no, because n can be up to (2b - 2)^2, but n must be less than b². Wait, maybe I made a mistake earlier.

Let me recast the constraints:

n is a two-digit number in base b, so n is between b and b² - 1, inclusive.

Also, n = s², so s² must be between b and b² -1. Therefore, s must be between ceil(sqrt(b)) and floor(sqrt(b² -1)).

But sqrt(b² -1) is less than b, so s can be as high as b -1, because s must be an integer. So s ranges from ceil(sqrt(b)) to b -1.

So, s is in [ceil(sqrt(b)), b -1].

But since s must satisfy m divides s(s -1), where m = b -1.

So, for each m, we can find the number of s in [ceil(sqrt(m + 1)), m] such that m divides s(s -1).

Hmm, perhaps it's getting a bit tangled here. Maybe I can think about the problem in terms of m = b -1 and s.

So, for each m, the number of s in [ceil(sqrt(m + 1)), m] such that m divides s(s -1).

And for each such s, we can compute d₁ = (s² - s)/m. Then, d₁ must be an integer between 1 and m (since d₁ is a digit in base b = m +1, so digits go up to m).

Wait, but d₁ is a digit in base b, so d₁ can be from 1 to m. So, (s² - s)/m must be between 1 and m.

So, 1 ≤ (s² - s)/m ≤ m.

Which implies:

m ≤ s² - s ≤ m².

But s is between ceil(sqrt(m +1)) and m.

So, let's think about this.

We can model this as for each m, the number of s in [ceil(sqrt(m +1)), m] such that m divides s(s -1), and 1 ≤ (s² - s)/m ≤ m.

But perhaps this is getting too abstract. Maybe it's better to try to find for each m, the number of s that satisfy these conditions.

Alternatively, perhaps I can model this as a quadratic equation in s:

s² - s - m * d₁ = 0.

But d₁ is (s² - s)/m, so it's an integer.

Alternatively, since m divides s(s -1), and s and s -1 are coprime, m must be a product of factors where each factor divides either s or s -1. So, m can be written as a product of two coprime numbers, say m = m1 * m2, where m1 divides s and m2 divides s -1, and m1 and m2 are coprime.

So, for each m, we can factor m into m1 * m2, where m1 and m2 are coprime, and then solve for s ≡ 0 mod m1 and s ≡ 1 mod m2.

The number of such solutions s in the range [ceil(sqrt(m +1)), m] will give the number of valid s for each factorization of m.

But this might get complicated, as m can be factored in multiple ways.

Alternatively, perhaps I can note that s must satisfy s ≡ 0 mod d or s ≡ 1 mod d, where d is a divisor of m.

Wait, more precisely, since m = d * e, where d and e are coprime, then s can be written as s ≡ 0 mod d and s ≡ 1 mod e, or s ≡ 1 mod d and s ≡ 0 mod e.

Each such solution will give a unique s modulo m, by the Chinese Remainder Theorem.

So, for each pair of coprime divisors d and e of m, where d * e = m, we get two solutions for s modulo m.

But s is in the range [ceil(sqrt(m +1)), m], so we need to check whether the solutions fall within this range.

But this seems a bit involved. Maybe I can consider specific cases for m and see how it scales.

Wait, perhaps I can think about how the number of solutions s increases with m.

I need to find the smallest m such that the number of s in [ceil(sqrt(m+1)), m] where m divides s(s -1) is greater than 10.

Wait, because for each such s, if d₁ is valid, then it counts as a b-eautiful number. So, if for a given m, there are k such s, then b = m +1 will have k b-eautiful numbers.

But I need to find the smallest m where the number of s exceeds 10, which would correspond to the smallest b = m +1 where the count is over ten.

So, perhaps I can try to find an expression for the number of s in [ceil(sqrt(m+1)), m] such that m divides s(s -1).

Alternatively, maybe I can find that for each m, the number of such s is equal to the number of divisors of m.

Wait, no, because for each divisor d of m, s can be congruent to 0 mod d or 1 mod d, but since m can have multiple factors, the number of s might be related to the number of ways to write m as a product of coprime factors.

Wait, but perhaps another approach. Since m divides s(s -1), and s and s-1 are coprime, m must be a product of factors that are each in s or s -1.

So, for each divisor d of m, we can set s ≡ 0 mod d and s ≡1 mod (m/d), provided that d and m/d are coprime.

Wait, perhaps for each divisor d of m, such that d and m/d are coprime, we can solve for s.

So, if d is a divisor of m, and m/d is also a divisor, and d and m/d are coprime, then the number of solutions is equal to the number of such d's.

But since d and m/d are coprime, the number of such d's would be 2^{k}, where k is the number of distinct prime factors of m, because each prime can be assigned to either d or m/d.

Wait, perhaps this is getting somewhere. Let me consider m as a product of k distinct primes. Then, the number of ways to split m into d and m/d with d and m/d coprime is 2^{k}.

Each such split would correspond to a solution s ≡0 mod d and s ≡1 mod (m/d).

Each split would give a unique solution modulo m, so each split corresponds to exactly one solution s in each block of m consecutive integers.

But since s must be in [ceil(sqrt(m +1)), m], which is a range of about m - sqrt(m) numbers, there could be multiple solutions per split.

Wait, but for each split, there is exactly one solution s in each interval of length m. So, if the range [ceil(sqrt(m +1)), m] is longer than m, which it isn't, but since the range is only up to m, each split gives at most one solution s in that range.

Wait, maybe not. Let me think with an example.

Suppose m = 6. Then, the possible splits are d=1 and m/d=6; d=2 and m/d=3; d=3 and m/d=2; d=6 and m/d=1.

But d and m/d must be coprime, so for m=6, which factors into 2 and 3, the coprime splits would be d=1, m/d=6; d=2, m/d=3; d=3, m/d=2; d=6, m/d=1.

Wait, but 2 and 3 are coprime, so d=2 and m/d=3 is a valid split. Similarly, d=3 and m/d=2 is another. Also, d=1 and m/d=6 are coprime, and d=6 and m/d=1 are coprime.

So, for each split where d and m/d are coprime, we can solve for s.

So, for each split, we can solve the congruences:

s ≡0 mod d,

s ≡1 mod (m/d).

Each such system has a unique solution modulo m.

So, for m=6, each split would give a solution s modulo 6.

Let me compute these.

1. d=1, m/d=6.

Solve s ≡0 mod 1 (which is always true),

and s ≡1 mod 6.

So, s ≡1 mod 6. So, solutions are 1,7,13,... But since s must be ≤6, the only solution is s=1.

But s must be ≥ ceil(sqrt(7))=3, so s=1 is too small. So, no solution in this case.

2. d=2, m/d=3.

Solve s ≡0 mod 2,

and s ≡1 mod 3.

Looking for s in 3 ≤ s ≤6.

Check s=4: 4 mod2=0, 4 mod3=1. Yes, s=4 is a solution.

3. d=3, m/d=2.

Solve s ≡0 mod3,

and s≡1 mod2.

Looking for s in 3 ≤ s ≤6.

Check s=3: 3 mod3=0, 3 mod2=1. Yes, s=3 is a solution.

s=6: 6 mod3=0, 6 mod2=0. No, doesn't satisfy s≡1 mod2.

4. d=6, m/d=1.

Solve s≡0 mod6,

s≡1 mod1 (which is always true).

So, s=6.

But s must be ≤6, so s=6.

Check if s=6 is ≥3: yes. So, s=6 is a solution.

So, for m=6, the valid s's are 3,4,6. Let me check if these satisfy m divides s(s-1).

For s=3: 3*2=6. 6 divides 6. Yes.

s=4: 4*3=12. 6 divides 12. Yes.

s=6: 6*5=30. 6 divides 30. Yes.

So, m=6, which is b=7, has 3 solutions. So, 3 b-eautiful numbers.

But I need to find when the number of solutions exceeds 10.

So, perhaps as m increases, the number of solutions increases, perhaps exponentially.

Wait, but let's see. For m=6, we have 3 solutions. Let's try m=12.

Wait, perhaps it's better to find a general formula or pattern.

Wait, for each split into d and m/d coprime, we get one solution s in the range [1, m]. But we need s ≥ ceil(sqrt(m+1)).

So, perhaps the number of valid s is equal to the number of such splits where the solution s is ≥ ceil(sqrt(m+1)).

But maybe it's difficult to model this. Alternatively, perhaps I can note that the number of solutions s is equal to the number of ways to write m as a product of two coprime factors, including 1 and m.

The number of such factorizations is 2^{k}, where k is the number of distinct prime factors of m.

Because for each prime in m's factorization, you can assign it to either d or m/d.

For example, if m is square-free with k distinct prime factors, then the number of coprime splits (d, m/d) is 2^{k}.

Wait, but for m=6=2*3, which is square-free with k=2, so 2^2=4 splits, which matches our earlier example.

Similarly, for m=12=2^2*3, the number of coprime splits would be 2^{2}=4, since the exponents don't matter as long as the primes are assigned to either d or m/d.

Wait, but wait, m=12, which is 2^2*3. The coprime splits would be:

d=1, m/d=12 → coprime? Yes.

d=3, m/d=4 → 3 and 4 are coprime.

d=4, m/d=3 → same as above.

d=12, m/d=1 → same as first.

d=2, m/d=6 → but 2 and 6 are not coprime.

d=6, m/d=2 → same as above.

d= any other divisor, like 2^2=4, but as before.

So, only four splits where d and m/d are coprime. So, yes, the number of coprime splits is 2^k, where k is the number of distinct prime factors.

So, for m with k distinct prime factors, the number of coprime splits is 2^k, each giving a solution s modulo m.

Each solution s is unique modulo m, so in the range [1, m], there's exactly one solution per split.

But we are interested in s in [ceil(sqrt(m+1)), m].

So, the number of valid s is equal to the number of splits where the solution s is ≥ ceil(sqrt(m +1)).

But how many of those solutions fall into that range?

Perhaps for each split, there's exactly one s in [1, m], so the fraction of s in [ceil(sqrt(m+1)), m] is (m - ceil(sqrt(m+1)) +1)/m.

But I'm not sure if that's useful.

Alternatively, perhaps for each m, the number of s is equal to the number of coprime splits where the corresponding s is ≥ ceil(sqrt(m+1)).

Wait, but maybe the number of solutions s is equal to the number of coprime splits, which is 2^k, but some of those s may be less than ceil(sqrt(m+1)), so we have to subtract those.

But this seems complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps I can note that for m with more prime factors, the number of solutions increases as 2^k, so to get more than ten solutions, I need 2^k >10, so k ≥4, since 2^4=16>10.

Wait, but wait, in the case of m=6, which has k=2, we had 3 solutions. Wait, that's less than 2^2=4. Hmm, perhaps my earlier assumption is incorrect.

Wait, in m=6, we had 3 valid s's: 3,4,6. But 2^2=4. So, perhaps not all splits lead to s in the desired range.

So, perhaps the number of solutions s is less than or equal to 2^k.

Therefore, perhaps to get more than ten solutions, I need m with a high number of distinct prime factors.

Let me test with m=2*3*5*7=210, which has k=4, so 2^4=16 splits.

But m=210, so b=211.

Then, s ranges from ceil(sqrt(211))=15 up to 210.

Each split would give a solution s in [1,210].

But how many of those s's are ≥15?

Perhaps all of them, except possibly those s's that are less than 15.

But for m=210, which is a large number, the s's would be spread across the range, so perhaps all 16 solutions fall into [15, 210], meaning 16 solutions.

But wait, that would give 16 b-eautiful numbers for m=210, which is more than ten. But perhaps a smaller m could also have more than ten solutions.

Wait, maybe m=24, which is 2^3*3, so k=2 distinct primes, so 2^2=4 splits. But perhaps some s's are in the valid range.

Wait, maybe it's better to try to compute for a few m's and see how the number of solutions scales.

But perhaps I'm overcomplicating this.

Another approach: For each m, the number of s's is equal to the number of divisors of m, but I'm not sure.

Wait, no, because each split into coprime factors gives a unique solution s. So, the number of solutions is equal to the number of coprime splits, which is 2^k, where k is the number of distinct prime factors of m.

So, if I can find m with k≥4, then 2^4=16>10.

So, the smallest m with k=4 is 2*3*5*7=210.

So, for m=210, the number of solutions would be 16.

But perhaps a smaller m with k=4 would give 16 solutions.

Wait, but 210 is the product of the first four primes, so it's the smallest m with k=4.

So, for m=210, I would have 16 solutions, which is more than ten.

But perhaps a smaller m with more splits could also have more than ten solutions.

Wait, perhaps m=60, which is 2^2*3*5, so k=3, so 2^3=8 splits.

But 8<10, so not enough.

Similarly, m=120=2^3*3*5, k=3, 2^3=8.

Still not enough.

m=180=2^2*3^2*5, k=3, 2^3=8.

Still 8.

m=210, as above, would have 16 solutions.

But wait, perhaps I'm wrong because for m=210, the number of solutions s is 16, each in [1,210], but how many of them are ≥ ceil(sqrt(211))=15.

I think all 16 solutions would be ≥15, since m=210 is large, but perhaps not.

Wait, let me check for m=210.

Each split gives a solution s in [1,210].

But for each split, the solution s would be at least 1, but could it be less than 15?

Hmm, for example, when d=1 and m/d=210, the solution is s≡0 mod1 and s≡1 mod210, which gives s=1, which is less than 15.

Similarly, when d=210 and m/d=1, s≡0 mod210 and s≡1 mod1, which gives s=210, which is acceptable.

So, for m=210, each split would give a solution s, some of which may be less than 15, so they wouldn't count.

So, the number of valid s's would be 16 minus the number of splits where s <15.

But how many splits would give s <15?

It depends on the solution s for each split.

Alternatively, perhaps it's difficult to compute exactly without enumerating each split.

Alternatively, perhaps I can look for m's with a high number of coprime splits, such that a large number of the solutions s fall into the required range.

Wait, perhaps another approach.

The number of s's is equal to the number of s in [ceil(sqrt(m+1)), m] such that m divides s(s-1).

Which is equivalent to s(s-1) ≡0 mod m.

So, for each m, the number of solutions s is equal to the number of integers s in [ceil(sqrt(m+1)), m] such that s ≡0 mod d or s≡1 mod d for each prime power d dividing m.

But perhaps this is too vague.

Alternatively, perhaps I can note that for m being a factorial, such as m=6=3!, m=24=4!, etc., the number of divisors increases, leading to more splits.

Wait, perhaps m=24, which is 2^3*3, so k=2, so 2^2=4 splits.

But then, the number of solutions s would be 4, which is less than ten.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps m=120=5!, which is 2^3*3*5, so k=3, leading to 8 splits.

But 8<10.

m=180=2^2*3^2*5, k=3, 8 splits.

Still 8.

m=210=2*3*5*7, k=4, 16 splits.

So, for m=210, perhaps the number of solutions s is 16, but subtract those that are less than ceil(sqrt(211))=15.

How many s's would be less than 15?

Each split gives a unique solution s modulo m.

So, for each split, there's exactly one s in [1, m].

Thus, for each split, the solution s could be less than 15 or not.

So, for m=210, how many of the 16 solutions are less than 15?

Well, perhaps 2 solutions: s=1 and s= something else.

Wait, for example:

- d=1, m/d=210: s≡0 mod1 (always true), s≡1 mod210 → s=1.

- d=210, m/d=1: s≡0 mod210, s≡1 mod1 → s=210.

- d=2, m/d=105: solve s≡0 mod2, s≡1 mod105.

The solution would be s ≡ (0 mod2, 1 mod105). Using Chinese Remainder Theorem, find s such that s=1 + 105k, and even.

105 is odd, so 1 +105k alternates even and odd. Let's find k such that s=1+105k is even.

1 is odd, 105 is odd. So, 1 +105k is even when k is odd: 1 +105*1=106, which is even.

So, s=106 is a solution. 106 ≥15, so that's valid.

Similarly, d=3, m/d=70: solve s≡0 mod3, s≡1 mod70.

Find s=1 +70k, which is divisible by3.

70≡1 mod3, so 1 +70k ≡1 +k mod3≡0 →k≡2 mod3.

So, k=2: s=1 +70*2=141.

141 ≥15, valid.

Similarly, d=5, m/d=42: s≡0 mod5, s≡1 mod42.

Find s=1 +42k, divisible by5.

42≡2 mod5. So 1 +42k ≡1 +2k mod5≡0 →2k≡4 mod5 →k≡2 mod5.

So, k=2: s=1 +42*2=85, which is ≥15.

Similarly, d=6, m/d=35: s≡0 mod6, s≡1 mod35.

Find s=1 +35k, which is 0 mod6.

35≡5 mod6. So, 1 +5k ≡0 mod6 →5k≡5 mod6 →k≡1 mod6.

k=1: s=1 +35=36, which is ≥15.

d=7, m/d=30: s≡0 mod7, s≡1 mod30.

Find s=1 +30k, which is 0 mod7.

30≡2 mod7. So, 1 +2k ≡0 mod7 →2k≡6 mod7 →k≡3 mod7.

k=3: s=1 +30*3=91, which is ≥15.

d=10, m/d=21: s≡0 mod10, s≡1 mod21.

Find s=1 +21k, divisible by10.

21≡1 mod10. So, 1 +k ≡0 mod10 →k≡9 mod10.

k=9: s=1 +21*9=190, which is ≥15.

d=14, m/d=15: s≡0 mod14, s≡1 mod15.

Find s=1 +15k, which is 0 mod14.

k=13: s=1 +15*13=196, which is ≥15.

d=15, m/d=14: s≡0 mod15, s≡1 mod14.

Find s=1 +14k, which is 0 mod15.

14≡14 mod15.

So, 1 +14k ≡0 mod15 →14k≡14 mod15 →k≡1 mod15.

k=1: s=1 +14=15, which is ≥15.

d=21, m/d=10: s≡0 mod21, s≡1 mod10.

Find s=1 +10k, which is 0 mod21.

10≡10 mod21. So, 1 +10k ≡0 mod21 →10k≡20 mod21 →k≡2 mod21.

k=2: s=1 +10*2=21, which is ≥15.

d=30, m/d=7: s≡0 mod30, s≡1 mod7.

Find s=1 +7k, which is 0 mod30.

7≡7 mod30. So, 1 +7k ≡0 mod30 →7k≡29 mod30 →k≡(29 * 7^{-1}) mod30.

The inverse of 7 mod30 is 13, since 7*13=91≡1 mod30.

So, k≡29*13=377≡377-12*30=377-360=17 mod30.

So, k=17: s=1 +7*17=120, which is ≥15.

d=35, m/d=6: s≡0 mod35, s≡1 mod6.

Find s=1 +6k, which is 0 mod35.

6≡6 mod35. So, 1 +6k ≡0 mod35 →6k≡34 mod35.

34 mod6= 34-5*6=34-30=4. So, 6k≡34 mod35.

Hmm, perhaps I can solve 6k ≡34 mod35.

Let me find the inverse of 6 mod35. 6 and 35 are coprime.

Find x such that 6x ≡1 mod35.

6*6=36≡1 mod35. So, inverse is 6.

So, k≡34*6=204≡204-5*35=204-175=29 mod35.

So, k=29: s=1 +6*29=1 +174=175, which is ≥15.

d=42, m/d=5: s≡0 mod42, s≡1 mod5.

Find s=1 +5k, which is 0 mod42.

5≡5 mod42. So, 1 +5k ≡0 mod42 →5k≡41 mod42.

Find inverse of 5 mod42. 5*17=85≡1 mod42. So, inverse is 17.

k≡41*17=697≡697-16*42=697-672=25 mod42.

So, k=25: s=1 +5*25=126, which is ≥15.

d=70, m/d=3: s≡0 mod70, s≡1 mod3.

Find s=1 +3k, which is 0 mod70.

3≡3 mod70. So, 1 +3k ≡0 mod70 →3k≡69 mod70.

69 mod3=0, so k≡23 mod70.

k=23: s=1 +3*23=70, which is ≥15.

d=105, m/d=2: s≡0 mod105, s≡1 mod2.

Find s=1 +2k, which is 0 mod105.

2≡2 mod105. So, 1 +2k ≡0 mod105 →2k≡104 mod105.

104 mod2=0, so k≡52 mod105.

k=52: s=1 +2*52=105, which is ≥15.

d=210, m/d=1: s≡0 mod210, s≡1 mod1 →s=210, which is valid.

Wait, so for each split, the solution s is as follows:

1. d=1: s=1 → less than 15, so invalid.

2. d=210: s=210 → valid.

3. d=2: s=106 → valid.

4. d=3: s=141 → valid.

5. d=5: s=85 → valid.

6. d=6: s=36 → valid.

7. d=7: s=91 → valid.

8. d=10: s=190 → valid.

9. d=14: s=196 → valid.

10. d=15: s=15 → valid.

11. d=21: s=21 → valid.

12. d=30: s=120 → valid.

13. d=35: s=175 → valid.

14. d=42: s=126 → valid.

15. d=70: s=70 → valid.

16. d=105: s=105 → valid.

So, out of 16 solutions, only one (s=1) is less than 15, so 15 valid s's.

So, m=210 would have 15 b-eautiful numbers, which is more than ten.

But is there a smaller m where the number of valid s's exceeds ten?

Let me check m=120, which is 2^3*3*5, so k=3, 2^3=8 splits.

So, for m=120, the number of solutions s is 8, each corresponding to a split.

But wait, let me see:

Each split would give a solution s in [1,120].

I need to see how many of these s's are ≥ceil(sqrt(121))=11.

So, for each split, let's find s:

1. d=1: s=1 → invalid.

2. d=120: s=120 → valid.

3. d=2: solve s≡0 mod2, s≡1 mod60.

Find s=1 +60k, even. k=1 → s=61, which is odd. So, next k=2 → s=121, which is beyond m=120, so no solution in [1,120].

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let's compute s for d=2:

s ≡0 mod2,

s ≡1 mod60.

Using Chinese Remainder Theorem:

Find s = 60m +1, which is even.

60m +1 ≡0 mod2 →60m ≡-1 mod2 →0 ≡1 mod2, which is impossible. So, no solution for d=2.

Wait, that can't be right because 60 is even, so 60m is even, 60m +1 is odd. So, no solution for d=2, m=120.

Hmm, this complicates things. So, for d=2, no solution exists in [1,120]. Similarly, perhaps other splits also don't yield solutions.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in assuming that each split leads to a solution. But in reality, some splits may not yield a solution within [1, m].

Wait, in our earlier approach, for each coprime split (d, m/d), we can solve s ≡0 mod d and s ≡1 mod (m/d). But if d and m/d are coprime, then by the Chinese Remainder Theorem, there's a unique solution modulo m. So, there should be exactly one solution in [1, m].

Wait, so in the case of m=120, d=2, m/d=60. Since 2 and 60 are not coprime, this split isn't a coprime split, so it's not considered.

Wait, that's the point. We only consider splits where d and m/d are coprime. So, for m=120, which is 2^3*3*5, the coprime splits are those where d is a product of some subset of the prime factors, and m/d is the product of the complementary subset.

So, for m=120, the coprime splits are:

d=1, m/d=120 → coprime.

d=3, m/d=40 → coprime? 3 and 40 are coprime? Yes.

d=5, m/d=24 → yes.

d=7, doesn't divide 120. Wait, 7 isn't a factor. Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of the prime factors.

Wait, m=120=2^3 *3 *5. So, the coprime splits would be:

d=1, m/d=120,

d=3, m/d=40,

d=5, m/d=24,

d=8, m/d=15,

d=15, m/d=8,

d=24, m/d=5,

d=40, m/d=3,

d=120, m/d=1.

Wait, but 8 and 15 are coprime (8=2^3, 15=3*5). So, m=120 has 8 coprime splits.

Now, for each split, find s in [1,120].

1. d=1: s=1 → invalid.

2. d=120: s=120 → valid.

3. d=3: solve s≡0 mod3, s≡1 mod40.

Find s=40k +1 ≡0 mod3.

40 mod3=1, so 40k +1 ≡k +1 ≡0 mod3 →k≡2 mod3.

k=2: s=40*2 +1=81 → valid.

4. d=5: solve s≡0 mod5, s≡1 mod24.

s=24k +1. 24k +1 ≡0 mod5 →24k ≡-1 mod5 →24≡4 mod5 →4k≡4 mod5 →k≡1 mod5.

k=1: s=24*1 +1=25 → valid.

5. d=8: solve s≡0 mod8, s≡1 mod15.

s=15k +1. 15k +1 ≡0 mod8 →15k ≡-1 mod8 →15≡7 mod8 →7k≡7 mod8 →k≡1 mod8.

k=1: s=15*1 +1=16 → valid.

6. d=15: solve s≡0 mod15, s≡1 mod8.

s=8k +1. 8k +1 ≡0 mod15 →8k ≡-1 mod15 →8k≡14 mod15 →k≡(14 * 8^{-1}) mod15.

8^{-1} mod15 is 2, since 8*2=16≡1 mod15.

So, k≡14*2=28≡13 mod15.

k=13: s=8*13 +1=105 → valid.

7. d=24: solve s≡0 mod24, s≡1 mod5.

s=5k +1. 5k +1 ≡0 mod24 →5k ≡-1 mod24 →5k≡23 mod24 →k≡(23 *5^{-1}) mod24.

5^{-1} mod24=5, since 5*5=25≡1 mod24.

So, k≡23*5=115≡115-4*24=115-96=19 mod24.

k=19: s=5*19 +1=96 → valid.

8. d=40: solve s≡0 mod40, s≡1 mod3.

s=3k +1. 3k +1 ≡0 mod40 →3k ≡-1 mod40 →3k≡39 mod40 →k≡13 mod40.

k=13: s=3*13 +1=40 → valid.

So, for m=120, the solutions s are:

s=120,81,25,16,105,96,40.

Wait, that's only 7 solutions, but I thought there were 8 splits. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, let's recount:

1. d=1: s=1 → invalid.

2. d=120: s=120 → valid.

3. d=3: s=81 → valid.

4. d=5: s=25 → valid.

5. d=8: s=16 → valid.

6. d=15: s=105 → valid.

7. d=24: s=96 → valid.

8. d=40: s=40 → valid.

Wait, that's 7 valid solutions, because s=1 is invalid.

Wait, but I have 8 splits, each giving one s in [1,120]. So, perhaps one of them is invalid.

Wait, no, for d=24, s=96 is valid, since 96≥11.

Wait, so perhaps for m=120, there are 7 valid solutions s.

But I thought earlier that the number of solutions would be 8, but one is invalid.

So, m=120 gives 7 solutions, which is more than 6 but less than ten.

So, m=210 gives 15 solutions, which is more than ten.

But perhaps a smaller m with more splits could give more than ten solutions.

Wait, let's check m=60=2^2*3*5, which has k=3 distinct primes, so 2^3=8 splits.

Compute the number of valid s's for m=60.

Compute s for each split:

1. d=1: s=1 → invalid.

2. d=60: s=60 → valid.

3. d=3: solve s≡0 mod3, s≡1 mod20.

s=20k +1. 20k +1 ≡0 mod3 →20≡2 mod3 →2k +1≡0 →2k≡2 →k≡1 mod3.

k=1: s=21 → valid.

4. d=5: solve s≡0 mod5, s≡1 mod12.

s=12k +1. 12k +1 ≡0 mod5 →12≡2 mod5 →2k +1≡0 →2k≡4 →k≡2 mod5.

k=2: s=25 → valid.

5. d=4: solve s≡0 mod4, s≡1 mod15.

s=15k +1. 15k +1 ≡0 mod4 →15≡3 mod4 →3k +1≡0 →3k≡3 →k≡1 mod4.

k=1: s=16 → valid.

6. d=12: solve s≡0 mod12, s≡1 mod5.

s=5k +1. 5k +1 ≡0 mod12 →5k≡11 mod12 →k≡(11 *5^{-1}) mod12.

5^{-1} mod12=5, since 5*5=25≡1 mod12.

So, k≡11*5=55≡7 mod12.

k=7: s=5*7 +1=36 → valid.

7. d=15: solve s≡0 mod15, s≡1 mod4.

s=4k +1. 4k +1 ≡0 mod15 →4k≡14 mod15 →k≡(14*4^{-1}) mod15.

4^{-1} mod15=4, since 4*4=16≡1 mod15.

So, k≡14*4=56≡11 mod15.

k=11: s=4*11 +1=45 → valid.

8. d=20: solve s≡0 mod20, s≡1 mod3.

s=3k +1. 3k +1 ≡0 mod20 →3k≡19 mod20 →k≡(19 *3^{-1}) mod20.

3^{-1} mod20=7, since 3*7=21≡1 mod20.

So, k≡19*7=133≡13 mod20.

k=13: s=3*13 +1=40 → valid.

So, the solutions are s=60,21,25,16,36,45,40.

That's 7 solutions, same as m=120.

So, m=60 gives 7 solutions.

Hmm, so m=210 gives 15 solutions, which is more than ten.

But perhaps there's a smaller m with more than ten solutions.

Wait, let's try m=840=2^3*3*5*7, which has four distinct primes, so 2^4=16 splits.

But m=840 is larger than 210, so perhaps 210 is the smallest.

Wait, but maybe m=30=2*3*5, which has k=3, so 2^3=8 splits.

Compute the number of valid s's for m=30:

Compute s for each split:

1. d=1: s=1 → invalid.

2. d=30: s=30 → valid.

3. d=2: solve s≡0 mod2, s≡1 mod15.

s=15k +1. 15k +1 ≡0 mod2 →15k ≡1 mod2 →k≡1 mod2.

k=1: s=16 → valid.

4. d=3: solve s≡0 mod3, s≡1 mod10.

s=10k +1. 10k +1 ≡0 mod3 →10≡1 mod3 →k +1 ≡0 →k≡2 mod3.

k=2: s=21 → valid.

5. d=5: solve s≡0 mod5, s≡1 mod6.

s=6k +1. 6k +1 ≡0 mod5 →6k ≡4 mod5 →k≡4 mod5.

k=4: s=25 → valid.

6. d=6: solve s≡0 mod6, s≡1 mod5.

s=5k +1. 5k +1 ≡0 mod6 →5k ≡5 mod6 →k≡1 mod6.

k=1: s=6 → invalid (since 6 < ceil(sqrt(31))=6 → s=6 is exactly 6, which is allowed.

Wait, ceil(sqrt(31))=6, so s=6 is allowed.

So, s=6 is valid.

7. d=7: doesn't divide 30, so no.

Wait, no, m=30, so splits are d=1,30; 2,15; 3,10;5,6;6,5;10,3;15,2;30,1.

Wait, but 7 doesn't divide 30, so not considered.

So, for d=6: s=6.

8. d=10: solve s≡0 mod10, s≡1 mod3.

s=3k +1. 3k +1 ≡0 mod10 →3k ≡9 mod10 →k≡3 mod10.

k=3: s=10 → valid.

9. d=15: solve s≡0 mod15, s≡1 mod2.

s=2k +1. 2k +1 ≡0 mod15 →2k≡14 mod15 →k≡7 mod15.

k=7: s=15 → valid.

10. d=30: s=30 → already considered.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let's list all splits:

1. d=1, m/d=30 → s=1 → invalid.

2. d=30, m/d=1 → s=30 → valid.

3. d=2, m/d=15 → s=16 → valid.

4. d=15, m/d=2 → solve s≡0 mod15, s≡1 mod2.

s=2k +1. 2k +1 ≡0 mod15 →2k≡14 mod15 →k≡7 mod15.

k=7: s=15 → valid.

5. d=3, m/d=10 → s=21 → valid.

6. d=10, m/d=3 → solve s≡0 mod10, s≡1 mod3.

s=3k +1. 3k +1 ≡0 mod10 →3k≡9 mod10 →k≡3 mod10.

k=3: s=10 → valid.

7. d=5, m/d=6 → s=25 → valid.

8. d=6, m/d=5 → solve s≡0 mod6, s≡1 mod5.

s=5k +1. 5k +1 ≡0 mod6 →5k≡5 mod6 →k≡1 mod6.

k=1: s=6 → valid.

So, the solutions s are 30,16,15,21,10,25,6.

That's 7 solutions, all ≥6 (since ceil(sqrt(31))=6).

So, m=30 gives 7 solutions.

Hmm, so m=210 seems to give 15 solutions, which is the first m where the number of solutions exceeds ten.

Therefore, the minimal m is 210, so the minimal b is m +1=211.

Wait, but earlier for m=210, I had 16 splits, but one solution was s=1, which was invalid, so 15 valid solutions, which is more than ten.

Thus, the least integer b is 211.


To solve the problem, we need to find the smallest integer \( b \geq 2 \) such that there are more than ten \( b \)-eautiful numbers. A number \( n \) is \( b \)-eautiful if it is a two-digit number in base \( b \) and the sum of its digits equals \( \sqrt{n} \).

### Key Steps:

1. **Understanding \( b \)-eautiful Numbers**:
   - A two-digit number in base \( b \) is represented as \( d_1d_0 \), where \( d_1 \) and \( d_0 \) are digits in base \( b \) (i.e., \( 0 \leq d_0 \leq b-1 \) and \( 1 \leq d_1 \leq b-1 \)).
   - The number \( n \) in decimal is \( n = d_1 \times b + d_0 \).
   - The sum of the digits \( d_1 + d_0 \) must equal \( \sqrt{n} \), so \( n = (d_1 + d_0)^2 \).

2. **Equation Setup**:
   - Equating the two expressions for \( n \), we get:
     \[
     d_1 \times b + d_0 = (d_1 + d_0)^2
     \]
   - Let \( s = d_1 + d_0 \). Then:
     \[
     d_1 \times b + d_0 = s^2
     \]
   - Substituting \( d_0 = s - d_1 \) into the equation gives:
     \[
     d_1 \times (b - 1) = s^2 - s
     \]
   - Therefore:
     \[
     d_1 = \frac{s^2 - s}{b - 1}
     \]
   - \( d_1 \) must be an integer between 1 and \( b-1 \), so \( b - 1 \) must divide \( s^2 - s \).

3. **Range of \( s \)**:
   - Since \( n \) is a two-digit number in base \( b \), \( n \) must satisfy \( b \leq n < b^2 \).
   - Thus, \( s = \sqrt{n} \) must satisfy \( \sqrt{b} \leq s < b \).

4. **Finding Valid \( s \) for Each \( b \)**:
   - For each \( b \), consider \( m = b - 1 \).
   - We need to find integers \( s \) in the range \( \lceil \sqrt{b} \rceil \leq s < b \) such that \( m \) divides \( s(s - 1) \).
   - The number of valid \( s \) values corresponds to the number of \( b \)-eautiful numbers.

5. **Counting Solutions**:
   - For \( m = b - 1 \), the number of valid \( s \) values is determined by the number of ways to factor \( m \) into coprime pairs \( (d, m/d) \).
   - Each coprime pair gives a solution \( s \) modulo \( m \), leading to one valid \( s \) in the range \( [1, m] \).

6. **Identifying the Smallest \( b \)**:
   - The smallest \( m \) with more than ten valid \( s \) values is \( m = 210 \), which has 15 valid solutions.
   - Thus, the smallest \( b \) is \( m + 1 = 211 \).

### Conclusion:
The least integer \( b \) for which there are more than ten \( b \)-eautiful numbers is:

\[
\boxed{211}
\]
