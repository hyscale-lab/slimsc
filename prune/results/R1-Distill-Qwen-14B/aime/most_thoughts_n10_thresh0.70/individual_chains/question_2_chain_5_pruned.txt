Okay, so I've got this geometry problem here. Let me try to parse it out step by step.

We have three points: O at (0,0), A at (1/2, 0), and B at (0, sqrt(3)/2). So, O is the origin, A is somewhere on the x-axis, and B is on the y-axis. Let me sketch this mentally. A is at (0.5, 0), and B is at (0, approximately 0.866). So, the line AB connects these two points. 

The family F consists of segments PQ of unit length. Each PQ has P on the x-axis and Q on the y-axis, and they are all in the first quadrant. So, PQ is a line segment starting on the x-axis, ending on the y-axis, with length 1. So, for each such segment, P is (p,0) and Q is (0,q), such that the distance between P and Q is 1, meaning sqrt(p² + q²) = 1. So, p and q satisfy p² + q² = 1.

Wait, but the points P and Q must be in the first quadrant, so p and q are positive. So, for each segment in F, it's a line from (p,0) to (0,q) where p² + q² =1.

Now, the problem says there is a unique point C on AB, different from A and B, that doesn't belong to any segment from F except AB. So, except for the segment AB itself, point C isn't on any other PQ in F.

We need to find OC², then express it as p/q where p and q are coprime, and find p + q.

Hmm. So, OC is the distance from the origin to point C, squared. So, once we find C's coordinates, we can compute that.

So, to rephrase, we need to find a point C on AB such that C is not on any other segment PQ in F except AB itself. So, C is only on AB and no other PQ in F. So, AB is part of F, right? Because AB is such a segment. Let's check: is AB of unit length?

Wait, point A is (1/2, 0) and point B is (0, sqrt(3)/2). So, the distance between A and B is sqrt[(1/2)^2 + (sqrt(3)/2)^2] = sqrt[1/4 + 3/4] = sqrt[1] = 1. So, AB is indeed a segment in F. So, AB is one of the PQ segments in F.

So, the family F includes all such segments where P is on the x-axis, Q on y-axis, and PQ has length 1. So, AB is one of them. Now, we need to find a point C on AB (other than A and B) that is not on any other segment in F.

So, in other words, for point C, the only PQ in F that contains it is AB itself. So, no other PQ in F passes through C. So, C is unique in that way.

So, how do we find such a point C?

I think we can parameterize AB and then find the point C such that it's not on any other PQ in F.

So, let's parametrize AB. Points on AB can be found using the line equation. Let's find the equation of AB.

Point A is (1/2, 0), point B is (0, sqrt(3)/2). So, the slope of AB is (sqrt(3)/2 - 0)/(0 - 1/2) = (sqrt(3)/2) / (-1/2) = -sqrt(3). So, the slope is -sqrt(3). So, the equation of AB is y - 0 = -sqrt(3)(x - 1/2). So, y = -sqrt(3)x + sqrt(3)/2.

So, any point on AB is (x, -sqrt(3)x + sqrt(3)/2). So, for x between 0 and 1/2.

Wait, but since AB goes from (1/2, 0) to (0, sqrt(3)/2), x goes from 0 to 1/2. So, x is in [0, 1/2], y is in [0, sqrt(3)/2].

Now, we need to find point C on AB, so (x, y) = (x, -sqrt(3)x
