Okay, so I've got this geometry problem here, and I need to find the product AB·AC in triangle ABC. The given information is that the triangle has a circumradius of 13 and an inradius of 6. Also, the line segment from the incenter I to vertex A is perpendicular to the segment from the circumcenter O to I. Hmm, that seems a bit complicated, but let's break it down step by step.

First, let me recall some basic concepts. The circumradius (R) is the radius of the circumscribed circle around the triangle, and the inradius (r) is the radius of the inscribed circle. The circumcenter O is the intersection point of the perpendicular bisectors of the triangle, while the incenter I is where the angle bisectors meet.

Given that IA is perpendicular to OI, that must mean that the line AI is perpendicular to the line OI. So, AI ⊥ OI. I need to visualize this. Maybe drawing a rough diagram would help. Let me imagine triangle ABC with O and I inside the triangle. Since IA is perpendicular to OI, that forms a right angle at point I between AI and OI.

Now, I know that in any triangle, the distance between the incenter and circumcenter can be found using the formula:

OI² = R(R - 2r)

Where R is the circumradius and r is the inradius. Let me check if that's correct. I think Euler's formula states that OI² = R² - 2Rr. Wait, is that right? Let me confirm. Yes, Euler's formula for the distance between the incenter and circumcenter is OI² = R² - 2Rr. So, plugging in the given values, R is 13 and r is 6. So, OI² = 13² - 2*13*6 = 169 - 156 = 13. Therefore, OI is sqrt(13).

Wait, but in this problem, there's an additional condition: IA is perpendicular to OI. So, maybe I can use some coordinate geometry here. Let me try setting up a coordinate system. Let me place point I at the origin (0,0) to simplify calculations. Then, since AI is perpendicular to OI, and I is at (0,0), point O must lie somewhere along the line perpendicular to AI at I.

Wait, perhaps it's better to choose coordinates such that AI lies along the y-axis and OI lies along the x-axis, given that they are perpendicular. Let me try that. So, let's place point I at (0,0). Since AI is perpendicular to OI, let me have AI along the y-axis and OI along the x-axis. So, point A is somewhere along the y-axis, say at (0, a), and point O is somewhere along the x-axis, say at (h, 0). The distance from I to O is sqrt(h² + 0²) = |h|, which we found to be sqrt(13), so h = sqrt(13) or -sqrt(13). Let's take h positive, so O is at (sqrt(13),
