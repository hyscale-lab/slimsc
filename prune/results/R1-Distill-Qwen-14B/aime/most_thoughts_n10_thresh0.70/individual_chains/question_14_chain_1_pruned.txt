Okay, so I've got this math problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again and understand what it's asking.

The problem says: Let N be the greatest four-digit positive integer with the property that whenever one of its digits is changed to 1, the resulting number is divisible by 7. Then, Q and R are the quotient and remainder when N is divided by 1000. I need to find Q + R.

Hmm, that's a mouthful. Let's break it down. First, N is a four-digit number, so it's between 1000 and 9999. It's the greatest such number, so I should aim for the largest possible N that satisfies the given condition.

The condition is that whenever one of its digits is changed to 1, the resulting number is divisible by 7. So, for example, if N is a four-digit number ABCD, then changing A to 1 gives 1BCD, changing B to 1 gives A1CD, changing C to 1 gives AB1D, and changing D to 1 gives ABC1. Each of these four numbers must be divisible by 7.

So, my goal is to find the largest N such that all these four variations (changing each digit to 1) are divisible by 7. Once I have N, I divide it by 1000 to get Q (the quotient) and R (the remainder). Then, I add Q and R together to get the answer.

Alright, let's think about how to approach this. Since N is a four-digit number, let's denote it as N = 1000a + 100b + 10c + d, where a, b, c, d are its digits, with a being from 1 to 9 and b, c, d from 0 to 9.

Now, according to the problem, changing each digit to 1 should result in a number divisible by 7. So, let's write down what each of those numbers would be.

1. Changing a to 1: 1000*1 + 100b + 10c + d = 1000 + 100b + 10c + d. Let's call this number N1.
2. Changing b to 1: 1000a + 100*1 + 10c + d = 1000a + 100 + 10c + d. Let's call this N2.
3. Changing c to 1: 1000a + 100b + 10*1 + d = 1000a + 100b + 10 + d. Let's call this N3.
4. Changing d to 1: 1000a + 100b + 10c + 1. Let's call this N4.

Each of N1, N2, N3, N4 must be divisible by 7. So, N1 ≡ 0 mod7, N2 ≡0 mod7, N3≡0 mod7, N4≡0 mod7.

I need to find N, the largest four-digit number, such that all these four numbers are divisible by 7.

Hmm. So, how can I model this? Let's think about each condition.

First, let's consider N1: 1000 + 100b + 10c + d ≡0 mod7.

Similarly, N2: 1000a + 100 +10c + d ≡0 mod7.

N3: 1000a +100b +10 +d ≡0 mod7.

N4: 1000a + 100b +10c +1 ≡0 mod7.

So, each of these four expressions must be congruent to 0 modulo 7.

Since N itself is 1000a +100b +10c +d, perhaps I can express each of these conditions in terms of N and the digit changed.

Wait, maybe another approach. Since each of these modified numbers is divisible by 7, perhaps I can write each in terms of N.

Let's see:

N1 is changing a to 1: So, N1 = (1)*1000 + 100b + 10c + d. Which is equal to (1000a + 100b +10c +d) - 1000a + 1000*1. Wait, no, maybe another way.

Wait, perhaps expressing N1 in terms of N.

Wait, N is 1000a + 100b + 10c + d. So, N1 is 1000*1 + 100b +10c + d. So, N1 = 1000 + 100b +10c +d. That's equal to N - 1000a + 1000*1. So, N1 = N - a*1000 + 1000.

Similarly, N2 is changing the hundreds digit to 1: 1000a + 100*1 + 10c + d. So, N2 = N - 100b + 100*1.

Similarly, N3 is changing the tens digit to 1: N3 = N - 10c +10*1.

N4 is changing the units digit to 1: N4 = N - d +1.

So, each of N1, N2, N3, N4 can be expressed as N minus the original digit times the place value plus 1 times the place value.

So, for N1: N1 = N - a*1000 + 1000. So, N1 = N + (1 - a)*1000.

Similarly,

N2 = N + (1 - b)*100,

N3 = N + (1 - c)*10,

N4 = N + (1 - d)*1.

Each of these must be divisible by 7.

So, for each of these expressions:

N1 ≡0 mod7,

N2 ≡0 mod7,

N3 ≡0 mod7,

N4 ≡0 mod7.

Which can be rewritten as:

N + (1 - a)*1000 ≡0 mod7,

N + (1 - b)*100 ≡0 mod7,

N + (1 - c)*10 ≡0 mod7,

N + (1 - d)*1 ≡0 mod7.

So, N ≡ - (1 - a)*1000 mod7,

N ≡ - (1 - b)*100 mod7,

N ≡ - (1 - c)*10 mod7,

N ≡ - (1 - d)*1 mod7.

So, these four congruences must all be true.

Alternatively, since N must satisfy all four congruences, perhaps I can write four equations based on these.

Let me compute each coefficient modulo7.

Let's calculate 1000 mod7, 100 mod7, 10 mod7, and 1 mod7.

1000 divided by 7: 7*142=994, so 1000-994=6. So,
