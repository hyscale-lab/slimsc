Okay, so I have this problem about a tetrahedron ABCD with some specific edge lengths, and I need to find the distance from the incenter (I think that's what they're calling point I) to each face. The incenter in a tetrahedron is the point that's equidistant from all four faces, right? So, this distance is like the radius of the inscribed sphere.

First, let me write down the given edge lengths:

- AB = CD = √41
- AC = BD = √80
- BC = AD = √89

Hmm, interesting. It looks like the opposite edges are equal. So AB equals CD, AC equals BD, and BC equals AD. I remember that in a tetrahedron, if all opposite edges are equal, it's called an isosceles tetrahedron. I think these have some special properties, like their opposite edges are equal, and the inradius can be found using a particular formula.

Wait, but I'm not exactly sure. Maybe I should recall the formula for the inradius of a tetrahedron. I think it involves the volume and the surface area. Let me think. For a tetrahedron, the inradius r is equal to 3 times the volume V divided by the sum of the areas of the four faces. So, r = 3V / (A1 + A2 + A3 + A4), where A1, A2, etc., are the areas of the faces.

So, to find r, I need to find the volume V of the tetrahedron and the areas of all four faces. Then I can compute 3V divided by the total surface area.

But how do I find the volume? Well, since all opposite edges are equal, maybe the tetrahedron is symmetric in some way. I think such tetrahedrons can be inscribed in a rectangular box, so that each edge corresponds to a space diagonal of the box. If that's possible, then I can use the formula for the volume based on the box dimensions.

Let me try that approach. Let's assume that the tetrahedron is formed by connecting alternating vertices of a rectangular box. Let the edges of the box be of lengths a, b, c. Then the space diagonals would be √(a² + b² + c²). But in our case, the edges of the tetrahedron are given as AB = √41, AC = √80, etc., but wait, the edges of the tetrahedron are not the space diagonals but the edges of the box.

Wait, no. Let me clarify. If the tetrahedron is formed by four vertices of a box, then each edge of the tetrahedron would be a face diagonal of the box. Or maybe a space diagonal. I think in this case, since opposite edges are equal, they might be the face diagonals.

Wait, let me think again. Let me assign coordinates to the tetrahedron vertices so that it's centered at the origin or something. Maybe place point A at (x, y, z), and then other points accordingly.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to model the box such that each edge of the tetrahedron corresponds to a face diagonal of the box. So, for example, AB could be a face diagonal on the front face, CD on the back face, etc.

Wait, maybe I should look for a coordinate system where the tetrahedron's vertices can be placed symmetrically. Let me consider point A at (a, b, c), point B at (-a, -b, c), point C at (-a, b, -c), and point D at (a, -b, -c). This kind of symmetry often leads to equal opposite edges.

Let me check the distances between these points. The distance AB would be sqrt[(a - (-a))² + (b - (-b))² + (c - c)²] = sqrt[(2a)² + (2b)² + 0] = sqrt(4a² + 4b²) = 2√(a² + b²). Similarly, the distance CD would be between points C and D: sqrt[( -a - a)² + (b - (-b))² + (-c - (-c))²] = sqrt[(-2a)² + (2b)^2 + 0] = same as AB, so 2√(a² + b²). According to the problem, AB = CD = √41, so 2√(a² + b²) = √41. Therefore, √(a² + b²) = √41 / 2, so a² + b² = 41/4.

Similarly, let's compute AC. Point A is (a, b, c), point C is (-a, b, -c). So, distance AC is sqrt[(a - (-a))² + (b - b)² + (c - (-c))²] = sqrt[(2a)^2 + 0 + (2c)^2] = sqrt(4a² + 4c²) = 2√(a² + c²). The problem states AC = √80, so 2√(a² + c²) = √80. Then, √(a² + c²) = √80 / 2 = √20, so a² + c² = 20.

Similarly, let's compute BC. Point B is (-a, -b, c), and point C is (-a, b, -c). So, distance BC is sqrt[(-a - (-a))² + (-b - b)^2 + (c - (-c))^2] = sqrt[0 + (-2b)^2 + (2c)^2] = sqrt(4b² + 4c²) = 2√(b² + c²). The problem states BC = √89, so 2√(b² + c²) = √89. Therefore, √(b² + c²) = √89 / 2, so b² + c² = 89/4.

Now, I have three equations:

1. a² + b² = 41/4
2. a² + c² = 20
3. b² + c² = 89/4

Let me write them again:

Equation 1: a² + b² = 41/4
Equation 2: a² + c² = 20
Equation 3: b² + c² = 89/4

I can solve these equations for a², b², c².

Let me subtract Equation 1 from Equation 2: (a² + c²) - (a² + b²) = 20 - 41/4
So, c² - b² = 20 - 10.25 = 9.75 = 39/4

So, Equation 4: c² - b² = 39/4

But from Equation 3, b² + c² = 89/4

So now, I have:

Equation 3: b² + c² = 89/4
Equation 4: c² - b² = 39/4

Adding Equations 3 and 4: 2c² = (89 + 39)/4 = 128/4 = 32 => c² = 16

So, c² = 16, so c = 4 or c = -4. Since it's a coordinate, I can take c = 4.

Then, from Equation 4: c² - b² = 39/4 => 16 - b² = 39/4

So, 16 is 64/4, so 64/4 - b² = 39/4 => b² = 64/4 - 39/4 = 25/4 => b = 5/2 or -5/2.

Similarly, from Equation 1: a² + b² = 41/4 => a² + 25/4 = 41/4 => a² = 16/4 = 4 => a = 2 or -2.

So, now I have a² = 4, b² = 25/4, c² = 16.

So, a = 2, b = 5/2, c = 4.

Therefore, the coordinates of the points are:

A: (2, 5/2, 4)
B: (-2, -5/2, 4)
C: (-2, 5/2, -4)
D: (2, -5/2, -4)

Wait, let me check that. Earlier, I assigned:

A: (a, b, c)
B: (-a, -b, c)
C: (-a, b, -c)
D: (a, -b, -c)

So with a=2, b=5/2, c=4:

A: (2, 5/2, 4)
B: (-2, -5/2, 4)
C: (-2, 5/2, -4)
D: (2, -5/2, -4)

Yes, that seems correct.

Now, I need to compute the volume of the tetrahedron. One way to compute the volume when you have coordinates is to use the scalar triple product.

The formula is V =
