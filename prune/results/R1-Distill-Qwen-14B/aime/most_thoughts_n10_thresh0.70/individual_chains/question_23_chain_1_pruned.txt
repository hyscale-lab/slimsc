Okay, so I'm trying to solve this problem where we have four points A, B, C, D on the hyperbola (x²)/20 - (y²)/24 = 1. These points form a rhombus ABCD, and the diagonals intersect at the origin. I need to find the greatest real number that is less than BD² for all such rhombi. Hmm, sounds a bit challenging, but I'll try to break it down.

First, let me recall what a rhombus is. A rhombus is a quadrilateral with all sides equal in length, and its diagonals bisect each other at right angles. Wait, no, actually, the diagonals bisect each other but aren't necessarily perpendicular unless it's a square. Wait, no, correction: in a rhombus, the diagonals are not necessarily perpendicular, but they do bisect each other at right angles. Wait, no, I think I'm mixing up properties. Let me double-check.

No, actually, in a rhombus, the diagonals are not perpendicular unless it's a square. Wait, no, that's not right. I think in a rhombus, the diagonals are not equal but they do bisect each other at right angles. Yes, that's correct. So, the diagonals of a rhombus intersect at 90 degrees and bisect each other. So, in this case, since the diagonals intersect at the origin, the origin is the midpoint of both diagonals.

So, points A, B, C, D are on the hyperbola, and the diagonals AC and BD intersect at the origin. So, if the origin is the midpoint, then if point A is (x, y), point C would be (-x, -y), right? Similarly, if point B is (p, q), then point D would be (-p, -q). So, all four points are determined by pairs of points symmetric about the origin.

So, the rhombus has vertices at A, B, C, D with coordinates (x, y), (p, q), (-x, -y), (-p, -q). Now, in a rhombus, all sides are equal, so the distances AB, BC, CD, DA are equal.

So, perhaps I can express this in terms of coordinates. Let me write the coordinates:

A = (x, y)

B = (p, q)

C = (-x, -y)

D = (-p, -q)

Now, since ABCD is a rhombus, all sides are equal.

So, the distance from A to B should be equal to the distance from B to C, etc.

Wait, but maybe it's easier to use vectors or coordinate differences. Alternatively, since it's a rhombus, the diagonals bisect each other, and the diagonals are perpendicular. Wait, hold on: in a rhombus, the diagonals are perpendicular bisectors of each other. So, vector AC is ( -2x, -2y ), and vector BD is ( -2p, -2q ). Since the diagonals are perpendicular, their dot product is zero.

Wait, more accurately, the vectors AC and BD are perpendicular. So, if AC is from A to C
