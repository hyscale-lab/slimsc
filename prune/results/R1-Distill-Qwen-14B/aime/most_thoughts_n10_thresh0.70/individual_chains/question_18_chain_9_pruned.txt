Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the number of rectangles that can be formed inside a regular dodecagon. Each side of the rectangle has to lie on either a side or a diagonal of the dodecagon. Hmm, that sounds a bit tricky, but let me try to break it down.

First, I should recall what a regular dodecagon is. It's a 12-sided polygon with all sides equal and all internal angles equal. Each internal angle in a regular dodecagon is 150 degrees, but I'm not sure if that's directly relevant here.

The problem is about finding rectangles inside this shape. A rectangle has four sides, with opposite sides equal and all angles 90 degrees. But in a regular dodecagon, the sides and diagonals can form different angles. So, I need to figure out how to form such rectangles.

I remember that in regular polygons, especially those with an even number of sides, it's possible to have sides and diagonals that are perpendicular to each other. Since 12 is even, maybe that helps.

Let me visualize the dodecagon. It's a 12-sided figure, so it can be inscribed in a circle, with each vertex equally spaced around the circumference. The distance between any two vertices can be a side or a diagonal, depending on how many steps apart they are around the polygon.

In a regular dodecagon, the number of diagonals can be calculated, but maybe that's not necessary here. Instead, I should think about how rectangles can be formed using these sides and diagonals.

Wait, in a regular polygon, a rectangle would require four points where the sides are either sides or diagonals of the polygon, and the angles between them are 90 degrees.

But how do I ensure that the sides are perpendicular? Maybe by selecting points that are spaced in a certain way around the polygon.

Let me think about how to form a rectangle. A rectangle requires two pairs of parallel sides, and the sides must meet at right angles. In the context of a regular dodecagon, the sides and diagonals can be of different lengths, depending on how many edges they skip.

So, for example, in a regular polygon, a diagonal that skips one vertex is adjacent, but in a dodecagon, the sides are the edges, and the diagonals can be of different lengths.

Wait, in a regular dodecagon, the diagonals can be categorized based on how many vertices they skip. So, a diagonal that connects two vertices with one vertex in between is called a "short diagonal," and those that skip more vertices are longer.

But how does this relate to forming rectangles?

Maybe I should consider the concept of diameters. In a regular polygon, a diameter is a diagonal that passes through the center. In a dodecagon, these diameters are the longest diagonals, connecting opposite vertices.

But not all rectangles have diameters as their sides. Some might be smaller.

Alternatively, perhaps the key is to find two pairs of parallel sides, each pair separated by a certain number of steps around the polygon.

Wait, perhaps I can model the dodecagon as being on a coordinate system, with each vertex at a certain angle from the center. Then, the sides and diagonals can be represented as vectors, and the rectangles can be found by selecting vectors that are perpendicular.

But that might get complicated. Let me think of a different approach.

In a regular polygon with an even number of sides, like a dodecagon, it's possible to form rectangles by choosing vertices that are symmetrical with respect to the center.

Wait, for a rectangle, we need four points: let's say A, B, C, D, such that AB and CD are one pair of sides, and BC and DA are the other pair, all meeting at right angles.

But in a regular dodecagon, the sides and diagonals can form such right angles if they are appropriately spaced.

Alternatively, maybe I can think in terms of selecting two pairs of parallel chords (sides or diagonals) that are perpendicular to each other.

Wait, that might be a way. So, for each possible pair of parallel sides, we can pair them with another pair of
