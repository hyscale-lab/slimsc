Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the greatest four-digit number, N. The special thing about N is that if you change any one of its digits to 1, the resulting number is divisible by 7. Then, I need to find Q and R when N is divided by 1000, and compute Q + R.

Hmm, let me break this down. First, N is a four-digit number, so it ranges from 1000 to 9999. Since we're looking for the greatest such number, I should start checking from 9999 downwards until I find one that satisfies the condition.

What's the condition? If any single digit is changed to 1, the number becomes divisible by 7. So for each digit in N, replacing it with 1 should result in a number divisible by 7.

Wait, so if N is, say, ABCD, then changing A to 1 gives 1BCD, changing B to 1 gives A1CD, changing C to 1 gives AB1D, and changing D to 1 gives ABC1. Each of these four numbers must be divisible by 7.

That's a lot to check, but maybe I can find some pattern or rule that N must satisfy.

Let me denote N as a four-digit number: N = 1000a + 100b + 10c + d, where a, b, c, d are digits from 0 to 9, and a is at least 1 since it's a four-digit number.

The problem says that replacing any one digit with 1 gives a number divisible by 7. So:

1. Replacing a with 1: 1000*1 + 100b + 10c + d = 1000 + 100b + 10c + d must be divisible by 7.
2. Replacing b with 1: 1000a + 100*1 + 10c + d = 1000a + 100 + 10c + d must be divisible by 7.
3. Replacing c with 1: 1000a + 100b + 10*1 + d = 1000a + 100b + 10 + d must be divisible by 7.
4. Replacing d with 1: 1000a + 100b + 10c + 1 must be divisible by 7.

So, four conditions, each corresponding to replacing a different digit.

Hmm, maybe I can express each of these conditions as congruences modulo 7.

Let me recall that a number is divisible by 7 if it's congruent to 0 modulo 7.

So:

1. 1000 + 100b + 10c + d ≡ 0 mod 7
2. 1000a + 100 + 10c + d ≡ 0 mod 7
3. 1000a + 100b + 10 + d ≡ 0 mod 7
4. 1000a + 100b + 10c + 1 ≡ 0 mod 7

Hmm, maybe I can compute 1000, 100, 10, and 1 modulo 7 to simplify these expressions.

Let me calculate:

1 mod 7 = 1

10 mod 7 = 3

100 mod 7: 100 divided by 7 is 14*7=98, remainder 2. So 100 ≡ 2 mod 7.

1000 mod 7: Let's see, 7*142=994, so 1000 - 994 = 6. So 1000 ≡ 6 mod 7.

So:

1000 ≡ 6 mod 7

100 ≡ 2 mod 7

10 ≡ 3 mod 7

1 ≡ 1 mod 7

Let's rewrite each condition with these:

1. 6 + 2b + 3c + d ≡ 0 mod 7
2. 6a + 2 + 3c + d ≡ 0 mod 7
3. 6a + 2b + 3 + d ≡ 0 mod 7
4. 6a + 2b + 3c + 1 ≡ 0 mod 7

So, each condition becomes a linear equation modulo 7.

Let me write them as:

1. 2b + 3c + d ≡ -6 mod 7 → 2b + 3c + d ≡ 1 mod 7 (since -6 ≡ 1 mod 7)
2. 6a + 3c + d ≡ -2 mod 7 → 6a + 3c + d ≡ 5 mod 7 (since -2 ≡ 5 mod 7)
3. 6a + 2b + d ≡ -3 mod 7 → 6a + 2b + d ≡ 4 mod 7 (since -3 ≡ 4 mod 7)
4. 6a + 2b + 3c ≡ -1 mod 7 → 6a + 2b + 3c ≡ 6 mod 7 (since -1 ≡ 6 mod 7)

So now I have four congruences:

Equation 1: 2b + 3c + d ≡ 1 mod 7

Equation 2: 6a + 3c + d ≡ 5 mod 7

Equation 3: 6a + 2b + d ≡ 4 mod 7

Equation 4: 6a + 2b + 3c ≡ 6 mod 7

Hmm, this is a system of four equations with four variables: a, b, c, d. But since a, b, c, d are digits, each is between 0 and 9, with a ≥ 1.

Wait, maybe we can subtract equations to eliminate variables.

Let me see: Let's subtract equation 1 from equation 2.

Equation 2 - Equation 1:

(6a + 3c + d) - (2b + 3c + d) ≡ 5 - 1 mod 7

Simplify: 6a - 2b ≡ 4 mod 7

So, 6a - 2b ≡ 4 mod 7.

Similarly, let's subtract equation 3 from equation 4.

Equation 4 - Equation 3:

(6a + 2b + 3c) - (6a + 2b + d) ≡ 6 - 4 mod 7

Simplify: 3c - d ≡ 2 mod 7.

So now I have two new equations:

Equation 5: 6a - 2b ≡ 4 mod 7

Equation 6: 3c - d ≡ 2 mod 7

Wait, equation 6 can be rewritten as d ≡ 3c - 2 mod 7.

So, d = 3c - 2 + 7k, where k is an integer such that d is between 0 and 9.

Similarly, equation 5: 6a - 2b ≡ 4 mod 7.

Let me simplify equation 5:

Divide both sides by 2: 3a - b ≡ 2 mod 7.

Because 6 mod 7 is 6, and 2 is inverted as 4, but wait: 6a - 2b ≡4 mod7.

Wait, 6a ≡ 6*(a mod7), and 2b ≡ 2*(b mod7). Maybe it's better to rearrange:

3a - b ≡ 2 mod 7.

So, 3a ≡ b + 2 mod 7.

So, b ≡ 3a - 2 mod 7.

So, b = 3a - 2 +
