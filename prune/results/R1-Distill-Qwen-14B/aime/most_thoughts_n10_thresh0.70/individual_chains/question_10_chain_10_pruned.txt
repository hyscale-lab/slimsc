Okay, so I've got this math problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again and understand what's being asked.

Alice chooses a set A of positive integers. Then Bob lists all finite nonempty sets B of positive integers with the property that the maximum element of B belongs to A. Bob's list has 2024 sets. I need to find the sum of the elements of A.

Hmm. Let's break this down. Alice picks a set A, which is some collection of positive integers. Then Bob creates a list of all finite non-empty sets B where the maximum of B is in A. The number of such sets B is 2024. From this, I have to find the sum of the elements in A.

First, I should think about how the number of sets B relates to the set A. Each set B is finite, non-empty, and its maximum is in A. So for each element a in A, how many sets B have maximum a?

Let me consider an element a in A. If a is the maximum of B, then the rest of the elements in B must be less than a. So for each a in A, the number of possible sets B with maximum a is equal to the number of subsets of {1, 2, ..., a-1}, since each such subset can be combined with {a} to form a set B where a is the maximum.

But wait, since B is non-empty, the subsets of {1, 2, ..., a-1} can be any subset except the empty set because when we add a, the set B will include a and some elements less than a. Wait no, actually, the subsets can include the empty set because if we take the empty subset and add a, we get {a}, which is a valid non-empty set. So, for each a in A, the number of B sets where a is the maximum is 2^{a-1}. Because the number of subsets of {1, 2, ..., a-1} is 2^{a-1}.

So, if A has elements a1, a2, ..., an, then the total number of sets B is the sum over each a in A of 2^{a-1}. So, total B sets = sum_{a in A} 2^{a-1}.

But in the problem, Bob's list has 2024 sets. So, sum_{a in A} 2^{a-1} = 2024.

So, my task reduces to finding all possible A such that the sum of 2^{a-1} for each a in A equals 2024, and then find the sum of the elements of A.

Wait, but since A is a set of positive integers, and each a is unique, so weâ€™re looking for a set of integers where the sum of 2^{a-1} is 2024.

This seems similar to binary representations. Let me think about how 2024 can be expressed as a sum of powers of two. Because each term is 2^{a-1}, which is a power of two.

So, 2024 in binary is... Let me compute that. 2024 divided by 2 is 1012, remainder 0. 1012 /2=506, r0. 506/2=253, r0. 253/2=126 r1. 126/2=63 r0. 63/2=31 r1. 31/2=15 r1. 15/2=7 r1. 7/2=3 r1. 3/2=1 r1. 1/2=0 r1.

So writing the remainders bottom to top: 11111101000. Let me count: 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 1 0 0 0. Wait, that's 11 bits.

So 2024 is 2^10 + 2^9 + 2^8 + 2^7 + 2^6 + 2^5 + 2^3. Wait, let me check:

2^10 = 1024,

2^9=512,

2^8=256,

2^7=128,

2^6=64,

2^5=32,

2^3=8,

Summing these: 1024+512=1536, +256=1792, +128=1920, +64=1984, +32=2016, +8=2024.

Yes, exactly. So, 2024 = 2^10 + 2^9 + 2^8 + 2^7 + 2^6 + 2^5 + 2^3.

But in our problem, the sum is sum_{a in A} 2^{a-1} = 2024. So, that means that each term 2^{a-1} corresponds to a bit set in the binary representation of 2024.

Therefore, the exponents a-1 correspond to the positions of the 1s in the binary representation of 2024.

Wait, let me think again. Each a in A contributes 2^{a-1} to the sum, so the exponents a-1 must be exactly the positions where the binary digits of 2024 are 1.

So, 2024 in binary is 11111101000, which has 1s at positions 3, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 (if we count from 0 on the right). Wait, let me check the positions.

Wait, in binary, the rightmost digit is position 0. So let's write 2024 in binary:

2024 /2=1012, rem 0 (pos 0)

1012/2=506, rem 0 (pos1)

506/2=253, rem 0 (pos2)

253/2=126, rem1 (pos3)

126/2=63, rem0 (pos4)

63/2=31, rem1 (pos5)

31/2=15, rem1 (pos6)

15/2=7, rem1 (pos7)

7/2=3, rem1 (pos8)

3/2=1, rem1 (pos9)

1/2=0, rem1 (pos10)

So the binary digits are from pos10 to pos0:

pos10:1, pos9:1, pos8:1, pos7:1, pos6:1, pos5:1, pos4:0, pos3:1, pos2:0, pos1:0, pos0:0.

So the 1s are at positions 3,5,6,7,8,9,10.

But wait, these are the exponents in 2^{a-1}, so a-1=3,5,6,7,8,9,10.

Therefore, a would be 4,6,7,8,9,10,11.

So A is {4,6,7,8,9,10,11}.

Wait, is that correct? Let me double-check.

Each a in A contributes 2^{a-1}. So for a=4: 2^{3}=8, a=6:2^5=32, a=7:2^6=64, a=8:2^7=128, a=9:2^8=256, a=10:2^9=512, a=11:2^10=1024.
