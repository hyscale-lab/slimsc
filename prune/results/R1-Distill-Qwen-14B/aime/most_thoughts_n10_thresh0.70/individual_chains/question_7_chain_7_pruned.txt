Okay, so I have this problem about a regular octagon where each vertex is colored either red or blue with equal probability. The question is asking for the probability that we can rotate the octagon such that all the blue vertices end up where the red vertices were originally. They mention that the probability is m/n where m and n are coprime, and we need to find m + n.

Hmm, let me try to break this down. First, I'm going to visualize a regular octagon. It has eight sides, so eight vertices. Each vertex is colored red or blue, each with a 50% chance. So, for each vertex, there's a 1/2 chance red and 1/2 chance blue, independent of the others.

The key part is the probability that the octagon can be rotated such that all the blue vertices move to positions that were originally red. So, if I rotate the octagon, the blue vertices must align with the red ones in the original configuration. That suggests that the set of blue vertices must be a rotation of the set of red vertices. Wait, but since red and blue are complementary, it's like the blue set must be a rotation of the red set, which is itself.

Wait, but another way to think about it is: if you have a coloring, and you can rotate it so that every blue vertex moves to a red vertex's position, then the blue and red sets are related by a rotation. So, the set of blue vertices must be a rotated version of the set of red vertices. But since the octagon is regular, red and blue sets must be in the same orbit under rotation.

But maybe I should think in terms of group theory. The rotation group of the octagon is the cyclic group C8, which has eight elements (rotations by 0째, 45째, 90째, ..., 315째). So, for each coloring, we can check if the blue vertices form a rotation of the red vertices.

Wait, but perhaps more straightforward: for a given coloring, we can consider all possible rotations and see if any rotation maps the blue vertices exactly to the red vertices. So, the problem is to find the number of colorings where such a rotation exists, divided by the total number of colorings, which is 2^8 = 256.

So, how do we compute the number of colorings where there exists a rotation r such that r(blue set) = red set. Alternatively, since the red set is the complement of the blue set, this is equivalent to r(blue set) = complement(blue set). So, that would mean that blue set is a rotation of its own complement.

That's an interesting condition. So, for a given coloring, the set of blue vertices must be a rotation of the set of red vertices, which is the same as saying that the blue set is equal to some rotation of the red set.

Another way to think about it: the coloring must be symmetric in such a way that the blue and red sets are related by a rotation. So, the coloring has rotational symmetry of some order.

Wait, but in group theory terms, the number of such colorings would be counted by Burnside's lemma or something similar? Maybe, but perhaps I can approach it more directly.

Let me consider all possible colorings and see when
