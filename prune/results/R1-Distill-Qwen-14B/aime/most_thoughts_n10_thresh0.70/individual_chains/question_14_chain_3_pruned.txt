Okay, so I've got this math problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again and understand what's being asked.

The problem says: Let N be the greatest four-digit positive integer with the property that whenever one of its digits is changed to 1, the resulting number is divisible by 7. Then, Q and R are the quotient and remainder when N is divided by 1000. I need to find Q + R.

Hmm, okay. So N is a four-digit number, the largest one possible, such that if you change any one of its digits to 1, the new number is divisible by 7. Then, when I divide N by 1000, I get Q as the quotient and R as the remainder. And then I just add Q and R together for the answer.

First, I should probably write N as a four-digit number, like N = ABCD, where A, B, C, D are digits, and A is not zero.

So N is ABCD, and when any single digit is changed to 1, the number becomes divisible by 7. That means:

- Changing A to 1: 1BCD is divisible by 7.
- Changing B to 1: A1CD is divisible by 7.
- Changing C to 1: AB1D is divisible by 7.
- Changing D to 1: ABC1 is divisible by 7.

All four of these numbers must be divisible by 7.

And N is the greatest such four-digit number. So, we want the maximum possible N, so ideally, N is 9999, but probably it's smaller because changing a digit to 1 would break the divisibility by 7.

So, my strategy is to find the largest N such that all four variations (changing each digit to 1) are divisible by 7.

Let me think about how to approach this.

Each of these modified numbers must be divisible by 7. So, for each digit position, the modified number is congruent to 0 mod 7.

Let me denote N as ABCD, which is 1000A + 100B + 10C + D.

Now, the modified numbers when each digit is changed to 1 are:

1. 1BCD: 1000*1 + 100B + 10C + D = 1000 + 100B + 10C + D
2. A1CD: 1000A + 100*1 + 10C + D = 1000A + 100 + 10C + D
3. AB1D: 1000A + 100B + 10*1 + D = 1000A + 100B + 10 + D
4. ABC1: 1000A + 100B + 10C + 1 = N - D + 1

Each of these four numbers is divisible by 7.

So, for each of these modified numbers, we can set up congruence relations.

Let me denote N as ABCD as 1000A + 100B + 10C + D.

Then, the four modified numbers are:

1. 1BCD = 1000 + 100B + 10C + D.
2. A1CD = 1000A + 100 + 10C + D.
3. AB1D = 1000A + 100B + 10 + D.
4. ABC1 = 1000A + 100B + 10C + 1.

Each of these is congruent to 0 mod 7.

So, for each, we can write:

1. 1000 + 100B + 10C + D ≡ 0 mod 7
2. 1000A + 100 + 10C + D ≡ 0 mod 7
3. 1000A + 100B + 10 + D ≡ 0 mod 7
4. 1000A + 100B + 10C + 1 ≡ 0 mod 7

But since N is 1000A + 100B + 10C + D, let's see if we can express these in terms of N.

Let me compute each modified number in terms of N.

1. 1BCD = 1000 + 100B + 10C + D = 1000 + (100B + 10C + D) = 1000 + (N - 1000A)
2. A1CD = 1000A + 100 + 10C + D = 1000A + 100 + (10C + D) = 1000A + 100 + (N - 1000A - 100B)
3. AB1D = 1000A + 100B + 10 + D = 1000A + 100B + 10 + D = 10 + (N - 10C - D) + D = 10 + (N - 10C)
4. ABC1 = N - D + 1

Wait, maybe that's more complicated than it needs to be. Alternatively, perhaps I can express each modified number in terms of N and the digit being changed.

For example:

1. When changing A to 1: 1BCD = 1000 + 100B + 10C + D = (1000A + 100B + 10C + D) - 1000A + 1000 = N - 1000A + 1000
2. Changing B to 1: A1CD = 1000A + 100 + 10C + D = N - 100B + 100
3. Changing C to 1: AB1D = 1000A + 100B + 10 + D = N - 10C + 10
4. Changing D to 1: ABC1 = 1000A + 100B + 10C + 1 = N - D + 1

So, each modified number is:

1. N - 1000A + 1000
2. N - 100B + 100
3. N - 10C + 10
4. N - D + 1

Each of these must be congruent to 0 mod 7.

So, we can write:

1. (N - 1000A + 1000) ≡ 0 mod 7
2. (N - 100B + 100) ≡ 0 mod 7
3. (N - 10C + 10) ≡ 0 mod 7
4. (N - D + 1) ≡ 0 mod 7

Hmm, perhaps I can rearrange each of these.

Let's denote:

1. N + (-1000A + 1000) ≡ 0 mod 7
2. N + (-100B + 100) ≡ 0 mod 7
3. N + (-10C + 10) ≡ 0 mod 7
4. N + (-D + 1) ≡ 0 mod 7

Which means:

1. N ≡ 1000A - 1000 mod 7
2. N ≡ 100B - 100 mod 7
3. N ≡ 10C - 10 mod 7
4. N ≡ D - 1 mod 7

So, each of these congruences must hold.

So, N must be congruent to each of these four expressions mod 7. Therefore, all four expressions must be equal mod 7.

So, 1000A - 1000 ≡ 100B - 100 ≡ 10C - 10 ≡ D - 1 mod 7.

Let me compute each coefficient mod 7.

First, 1000 mod 7. Let's compute that.

7*142 = 994, so 1000 - 994 = 6. So 1000 ≡ 6 mod 7.

Similarly, 100 mod 7: 7*14=98, so 100-98=2 → 100 ≡ 2 mod 7.

10 mod 7 is 3, since 10-7=3.

So, let's rewrite each expression mod 7.

1. 1000A - 1000 ≡ 6A - 6 mod 7
2. 100B - 100 ≡ 2B - 2 mod 7
3. 10C - 10 ≡ 3C - 3 mod 7
4. D - 1 mod 7

So, all four expressions must be congruent mod 7. Let's denote them all equal to k mod 7, where k is some integer between 0 and 6.

So:

6A - 6 ≡ 2B - 2 ≡ 3C - 3 ≡ D - 1 ≡ k mod 7

So, each of these expressions is ≡k mod 7.

So, let's write each as:

6A - 6 ≡ k mod 7 → 6(A - 1) ≡ k mod 7

2B - 2 ≡ k mod 7 → 2(B - 1) ≡ k mod 7

3C - 3 ≡ k mod 7 → 3(C - 1) ≡ k mod 7

D - 1 ≡ k mod 7 → D ≡ k + 1 mod 7

So, from these, we can express A, B, C, D in terms of k.

Let me note that 6, 2, 3 are coefficients, and since 6, 2, 3 are all co-prime with 7, their inverses exist mod 7.

So, for 6(A - 1) ≡ k mod 7:

Multiply both sides by the inverse of 6 mod 7. Since 6*6=36≡1 mod7, so inverse of 6 is 6.

Thus, (A - 1) ≡ 6k mod7 → A ≡ 6k +1 mod7.

Similarly, for 2(B - 1) ≡k mod7:

Inverse of 2 mod7 is 4, since 2*4=8≡1 mod7.

So, (B - 1) ≡4k mod7 → B≡4k +1 mod7.

For 3(C -1)≡k mod7:

Inverse of 3 mod7 is 5, because 3*5=15≡1 mod7.

So, (C -1)≡5k mod7 → C≡5k +1 mod7.

And D ≡k +1 mod7.

So, now we have:

A ≡6k +1 mod7

B ≡4k +1 mod7

C ≡5k +1 mod7

D ≡k +1 mod7

Now, since A, B, C, D are digits (0-9 for B, C, D; 1-9 for A), let's see how A, B, C, D relate to k.

But since N is the largest four-digit number possible, we want N to be as large as possible, so ideally A=9, B=9, C=9, D=9, but subject to the above congruences.

So, perhaps we can find k such that A, B, C, D are as large as possible, but consistent with the congruence relations.

Since A must be congruent to 6k +1 mod7, and A is between 1 and 9.

Similarly, B, C, D are between 0 and 9.

Let me try to find possible values of k (from 0 to 6) that would maximize A, B, C, D.

Since k can be 0,1,2,3,4,5,6, let's compute for each k, what A, B, C, D would be, considering that they're digits.

Let me make a table:

For each k (0-6), compute:

A = 6k +1 mod7. Since 6k mod7:

k:0 →6*0=0 → A=1

k=1 →6 →A=7

k=2→12≡5→A=6

k=3→18≡4→A=5

k=4→24≡3→A=4

k=5→30≡2→A=3

k=6→36≡1→A=2

Wait, because A ≡6k +1 mod7, but since A is a digit from 1-9, the value could be higher than 7, so it's not just mod7 but A can be 6k +1 +7m, where m is an integer such that A is between 1 and 9.

Wait, perhaps I should think differently. Since A ≡6k +1 mod7, the possible values for A are 6k +1, 6k +1 +7, etc., but A can't exceed 9.

So, for each k, A can be 6k +1 or 6k +1 +7, as long as it's <=9.

Similarly for B, C, D.

Wait, perhaps it's better to compute for each possible k from 0 to 6, and find the maximum possible A, B, C, D, then see which k gives the largest N.

Alternatively, perhaps we can solve for k such that A, B, C, D are digits, and then choose the largest N.

Let me try with k=0:

k=0

A ≡6*0 +1=1 mod7 → A=1,8 (since 1+7=8)

We want A as large as possible, so A=8.

B=4*0 +1=1 mod7 → B=1,8

Largest B=8.

C=5*0 +1=1 mod7 → C=1,8

Largest C=8.

D=0+1=1 mod7 → D=1,8 (since 1+7=8, but D can be at most 9, so 8 is possible.)

Wait, wait, D= k +1 mod7, which is 0+1=1 mod7. So D=1,8.

So, D=8 is possible.

So, N would be 8 8 8 8? Wait, but let me check.

Wait, A=8, B=8, C=8, D=8.

But let's check if each of the modified numbers is divisible by 7.

Wait, but perhaps N=8888.

But maybe 8888 is not the maximum N. Let's check for k=0.

Wait, but let me think: for k=0, A=8, B=8, C=8, D=8.

Is that possible? Let me check the congruences.

But perhaps I should first check for each k,
