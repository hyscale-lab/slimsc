Okay, so I have this math problem here about counting the number of paths on an 8x8 grid. The paths are of length 16, starting from the lower left corner and ending at the upper right corner. The catch is that these paths must change direction exactly four times. Hmm, okay, let me try to unpack this.

First off, I remember that in grid path problems, moving from one corner to another usually involves moving right and up. For an 8x8 grid, you need to move 8 steps right and 8 steps up, right? So the total number of steps is 16, which matches the given path length. Without any restrictions, the number of such paths is the combination of 16 steps taken 8 at a time for right moves (or equivalently for up moves). That would be C(16,8), which is 12870. But here, we have a constraint on the number of direction changes. So I need to figure out how that affects the count.

Wait, what's a direction change? I think a direction change happens when the path switches from moving right to moving up or vice versa. So, for example, if you move right a few times, then switch to moving up, each switch like that is a direction change. The problem says exactly four direction changes. So, how can I model this?

Let me think. Each time the path changes direction, it's like starting a new "run" of consecutive right or up moves. So, for four direction changes, how many runs do we have? Well, each direction change adds a new run, so starting from the first step, each change adds one more run. So, for four direction changes, the path is divided into five runs. For example, if we start with a right run, then up, then right, then up, then right, that's four changes and five runs total.

But wait, since the path starts at the lower left and ends at the upper right, the direction of the first run could be either right or up. Hmm, but in the examples provided, I think the starting direction is right. Wait, maybe not. Let me check. No, the problem doesn't specify, so I need to consider both possibilities.

Wait, but in an 8x8 grid, moving from lower left to upper right, the path must have an equal number of right and up steps, right? So 8 rights and 8 ups. So, if the path starts with a right, then alternates directions, but with four changes, that would result in five runs. Similarly, if it starts with an up, same number of runs.

Wait, but five runs mean that the number of runs is five. Now, since the path must start and end in a particular direction, depending on the number of direction changes.

Wait, maybe I should model this as a sequence of runs. Each run is a consecutive set of right or up moves. The key is that the number of direction changes is four, which implies the number of runs is five.

So, suppose the first run is right, then up, then right, then up, then right. That's four changes and five runs, ending with a right run. Alternatively, if the first run
