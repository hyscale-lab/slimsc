Okay, so I have this problem about a convex equilateral hexagon ABCDEF. All the opposite sides are parallel, which is an interesting property. The triangle formed by extending the sides AB, CD, and EF has side lengths 200, 240, and 300. I need to find the side length of the hexagon.

Hmm, let me visualize this. A convex hexagon with opposite sides parallel and equal in length since it's equilateral. So, AB is parallel to DE, BC is parallel to EF, and CD is parallel to FA. Since all sides are equal, AB = BC = CD = DE = EF = FA = s, where s is the side length I need to find.

Now, the triangle formed by extending AB, CD, and EF. I'm a bit confused about how that triangle is formed. If I extend AB, CD, and EF, they should meet at some points to form a triangle. Since the hexagon is convex, these extensions should form a larger triangle outside the hexagon.

Let me think about the triangle. Its sides are 200, 240, and 300. So, it's a scalene triangle. I need to relate this triangle to the hexagon.

Perhaps the triangle is similar to another triangle inside the hexagon or something like that. Wait, in such hexagons, sometimes similar triangles are formed when sides are extended. Maybe the triangle formed is similar to the hexagon's 'corner' triangles.

Alternatively, I remember that in a convex equilateral hexagon with opposite sides parallel, the sides can be considered as vectors in the plane. Since opposite sides are parallel and equal, the hexagon can be thought of as a translation of a smaller hexagon scaled by some factor.

Wait, maybe it's better to think in terms of homothety. Homothety is a transformation that enlarges or reduces a figure by a scale factor relative to a point. If I can find a homothety center that maps the hexagon to a triangle, that might help.

Alternatively, I recall that when all opposite sides of a hexagon are parallel, the hexagon can be inscribed in a triangle by extending its sides. The hexagon is then formed by intersecting lines that are extensions from the sides of this triangle.

Let me try to sketch this mentally. Imagine a large triangle, and within it, a hexagon where each side
