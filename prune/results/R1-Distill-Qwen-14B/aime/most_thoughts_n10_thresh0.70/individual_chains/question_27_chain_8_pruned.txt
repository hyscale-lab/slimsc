Okay, so I have this problem about a torus and a sphere. Let me try to picture it. A torus is like a donut shape, right? It's formed by rotating a circle around an axis that's in the same plane as the circle but doesn't intersect it. In this case, the circle has a radius of 3, and the distance from the center of the circle to the axis of rotation is 6. So the torus is created by spinning this circle around that axis.

Now, there's a sphere with radius 11. The problem says when the torus rests on the inside of the sphere, it's internally tangent along a circle with radius r_i. When it rests on the outside, it's externally tangent along a circle with radius r_o. We need to find r_i - r_o and express it as a fraction m/n where m and n are coprime, then find m + n.

Hmm. I think I need to find the radii of the circles along which the torus is tangent to the sphere in both internal and external cases. Then subtract them to get the difference.

Wait, how do tori and spheres interact in terms of tangency? I remember that for two surfaces to be tangent, they must touch at a single point or along a curve. In this case, it's along a circle, so they must be tangent along a circular path.

Let me try to model the torus mathematically. The standard equation of a torus centered at the origin, with the generating circle of radius a rotated around an axis at a distance R from the center is given by:

(√(x² + y²) - R)² + z² = a²

In our case, the generating circle has radius 3, so a = 3, and the distance from the center to the axis is 6, so R = 6. So the equation is:

(√(x² + y²) - 6)² + z² = 9

Now, the sphere is of radius 11. Let me think about when the torus is inside the sphere. So, the sphere has radius 11, centered where? I think it's probably centered at the origin as well, but I'm not entirely sure. The problem doesn't specify, so I have to assume it's centered at the origin too.

So the sphere's equation is x² + y² + z² = 11² = 121.

Now, when the torus rests on the inside of the sphere, they are tangent along a circle. Similarly, when the torus is on the outside, it's tangent along another circle.

I think the key here is to find the points where the torus and sphere intersect, and those points form a circle. The radius of that circle in the sphere's frame of reference is what we're looking for, r_i and r_o.

But how do I find the points of tangency?

I remember that for two surfaces to be tangent, their normals at the point of tangency must be the same. So, if I can find the normals to both surfaces at the tangent point and set them equal, that should give me some equations to solve.

Alternatively, maybe I can find the points where both the torus and the sphere have the same tangent plane. But that might be more complicated.

Wait, another approach: Maybe I can think about the distance from the origin to any point on the torus. For the torus, the distance from the origin varies depending on where you are. The sphere has a constant distance of 11 from the origin.

For internal tangency, the torus is entirely inside the sphere, except for the tangent circle. So, the maximum distance from the origin on the torus is 11. Similarly, for external tangency, the minimum distance from the origin on the torus is 11.

Wait, that might be a better way to approach it. So, for the internal tangent case, when the torus is
