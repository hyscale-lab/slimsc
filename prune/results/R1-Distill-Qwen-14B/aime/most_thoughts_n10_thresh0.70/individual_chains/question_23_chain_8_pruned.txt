Okay, so I've got this problem here about a hyperbola and a rhombus. Let me try to unpack it step by step.

The hyperbola equation is given as (x²)/20 - (y²)/24 = 1. So, it's a standard hyperbola centered at the origin, opening along the x-axis. The transverse axis is along the x-axis because the positive term is with x². The a² is 20, so a = sqrt(20) = 2*sqrt(5). The b² is 24, so b = 2*sqrt(6).

Now, the problem says that points A, B, C, D lie on this hyperbola, forming a rhombus ABCD. The diagonals of the rhombus intersect at the origin, which is the center of the hyperbola. So, the diagonals AC and BD intersect at the origin.

In a rhombus, the diagonals bisect each other at right angles. Wait, no, actually, in a rhombus, the diagonals bisect each other and bisect the angles, but they are not necessarily perpendicular unless it's a square. Wait, no, actually, I think in a rhombus, the diagonals are not necessarily perpendicular, but wait, no, I think that's the case for a kite. Wait, no, in a rhombus, which is a special kind of kite, the diagonals are perpendicular. Yes, that's correct. So, in a rhombus, diagonals are perpendicular bisectors of each other.

So, since diagonals intersect at the origin, which is the center, each diagonal is a line through the origin. So, the diagonals AC and BD are straight lines passing through the origin. So, they can be represented as y = m x and y = n x, where m and n are the slopes.

But since the diagonals are perpendicular, the product of their slopes should be -1. So, m * n = -1.

Now, the points A, B, C, D lie on the hyperbola. Since the diagonals intersect at the origin, the points are symmetric with respect to the origin. So, if point A is (x, y), then point C is (-x, -y), because it's the other end of the diagonal AC. Similarly, points B and D would be symmetric across the origin as well. So, if B is (p, q), then D is (-p, -q).

Wait, but in a rhombus, the diagonals are perpendicular and bisect each other. So, the four points A, B, C, D can be considered as the endpoints of the two diagonals. So, perhaps, A and C are endpoints of one diagonal, and B and D are endpoints of the other diagonal.

So, the diagonals AC and BD intersect at the origin, and they are perpendicular.

So, let's think about the coordinates of these points.

Let me denote the points as follows:

Point A: (x1, y1)

Point C: (-x1, -y1)

Point B: (x2, y2)

Point D: (-x2, -y2)

Since ABCD is a rhombus,
