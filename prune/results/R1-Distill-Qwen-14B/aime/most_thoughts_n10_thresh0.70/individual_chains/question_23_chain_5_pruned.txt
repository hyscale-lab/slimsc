Okay, so I've got this problem here about a hyperbola and a rhombus. Let me try to unpack it step by step. 

The hyperbola is given by the equation x²/20 - y²/24 = 1. So, that's a standard hyperbola centered at the origin, opening to the left and right along the x-axis. The transverse axis length is 2a, where a² = 20, so a = sqrt(20) = 2*sqrt(5). The conjugate axis is 2b, where b² = 24, so b = sqrt(24) = 2*sqrt(6). 

Points A, B, C, D are on this hyperbola, and they form a rhombus ABCD. The diagonals of the rhombus intersect at the origin. Since the rhombus is centered at the origin, the diagonals bisect each other there. So, the diagonals AC and BD intersect at (0,0). 

In a rhombus, the diagonals are perpendicular bisectors of each other. So, if I consider the diagonals AC and BD, they must intersect at right angles at the origin, and each diagonal is bisected by the other. 

Let me think about the coordinates of the points. Let's denote the coordinates of A, B, C, D in such a way that the diagonals are AC and BD. Since the diagonals intersect at the origin, if point A is (x, y), then point C must be (-x, -y), because the diagonals bisect each other. Similarly, if point B is (u, v), then point D must be (-u, -v). 

So, the four points are (x, y), (u, v), (-x, -y), (-u, -v). 

Since ABCD is a rhombus, all sides are equal. So, the distance between A and B must equal the distance between B and C, which equals the distance between C and D, and so on. 

But maybe there's a better approach. Since the diagonals are perpendicular, we can think about the slopes. Let me consider the slopes of AC and BD. The slope of AC would be (y - (-y))/(x - (-x)) = (2y)/(2x) = y/x. Similarly, the slope of BD would be (v - (-v))/(u - (-u)) = (2v)/(2u) = v/u. 

Since the diagonals are perpendicular, the product of their slopes should be -1. So, (y/x) * (v/u) = -1. Therefore, (yv)/(xu) = -1, which implies that yv = -xu. 

Alternatively, we can write this as yv + xu = 0. That's a useful condition. 

Now, all four points A, B, C, D lie on the hyperbola. So, substituting each into the hyperbola equation:

For point A: x²/20 - y²/24 = 1. 
For point B: u²/20 - v²/24 = 1. 

Similarly, points C and D will satisfy the same equations because they're just negatives of A and B, so their squares will be the same. 

So, I have these two equations:

1. x²/20 - y²/24 = 1
2. u²/20 - v²/24 = 1

And another equation from the perpendicular diagonals:

3. yv + xu = 0.

I need to find BD squared, which is the square of the length of diagonal BD. Let's compute BD.

Points B and D are (u, v) and (-u, -v), respectively. So, the distance between B and D is sqrt[(u - (-u))² + (v - (-v))²] = sqrt[(2u)² + (2v)²] = 2*sqrt(u² + v²). Therefore, BD squared is (2*sqrt(u² + v²))² = 4(u² + v²). 

So, BD² = 4(u² + v²). 

Our goal is to find the greatest real number less than BD² for all such rhombi. So, in other words, find the infimum of BD² over all possible such rhombi, and then take the greatest number less than that. Or, perhaps we need to find the minimum BD², which would be the infimum, and then the greatest number less than BD² for all rhombi would be the infimum itself, but I need to confirm. 

Wait, actually, since BD² can take a range of values, the problem is asking for the greatest lower bound, the supremum of the lower bounds, which is the infimum. But let me think again. It says the greatest real number that is less than BD² for all such rhombi. So, that number would be the infimum of BD², because for all rhombi, BD² is greater than this number, and this number is the greatest such. 

So, I need to find the minimum possible value of BD², because the infimum would be the minimum if it's attainable. Let's check whether the minimal BD² is attainable or not. 

So, our task is to minimize BD², which is 4(u² + v²), given the constraints:

1. u²/20 - v²/24 = 1
2. y²/24 = (x²/20) - 1
3. yv + xu = 0

Wait, but we need to express everything in terms of one variable or find a relation between u and v. 

Let me see. From equation 3: yv = -xu. So, y = (-xu)/v.

Wait, but from equation 1, we have x²/20 - y²/24 = 1. Substituting y here:

x²/20 - [(-xu/v)²]/24 = 1

Which is x²/20 - (x²u²)/(24v²) = 1

Similarly, from equation 2, u²/20 - v²/24 = 1, so u² = 20(1 + v²/24) = 20 + (20v²)/24 = 20 + (5v²)/6.

So, u² = 20 + (5v²)/6.

Wait, but perhaps I can express x in terms of u and v. Let's try that.

From equation 3: yv = -xu, so x = (-yv)/u. Wait, but I have another equation 1 involving x and y.

Alternatively, maybe I can write x and y in terms of u and v. Let me consider that.

Wait, perhaps I can parameterize the points on the hyperbola. For hyperbola x²/a² - y²/b²=1, a parametrization can be (a secθ, b tanθ). Alternatively, using hyperbolic functions: (a cosh t, b sinh t). 

Let me think about using hyperbolic parametrization for points A and B.

Let me denote point A as (sqrt(20) cosh t, sqrt(24) sinh t). Similarly, point B can be parameterized as (sqrt(20) cosh s, sqrt(24) sinh s). 

Wait, but I need to relate points A and B because they form a rhombus with diagonals intersecting at the origin. Hmm, maybe this approach is complicating things.

Alternatively, perhaps consider that the diagonals are perpendicular, and that the points are symmetric about the origin. So, if A is (x, y), then C is (-x, -y), and B is (u, v), D is (-u, -v). 

Then, the four points of the rhombus are (x, y), (u, v), (-x, -y), (-u, -v). 

In a rhombus, all sides are equal, so the distance between (x, y) and (u, v) must equal the distance between (u, v) and (-x, -y), etc. 

So, let's compute the distance between A and B: sqrt[(x - u)^2 + (y - v)^2]

Similarly, the distance between B and C: sqrt[(u - (-x))^2 + (v - (-y))^2] = sqrt[(u + x)^2 + (v + y)^2]

Since it's a rhombus, these distances must be equal:

sqrt[(x - u)^2 + (y - v)^2] = sqrt[(u + x)^2 + (v + y)^2]

Square both sides:

(x - u)^2 + (y - v)^2 = (x + u)^2 + (y + v)^2

Expanding both sides:

x² - 2xu + u² + y² - 2yv + v² = x² + 2xu + u² + y² + 2yv + v²

Simplify:

Left side: x² - 2xu + u² + y² - 2yv + v²

Right side: x² + 2xu + u² + y² + 2yv + v²

Subtracting right side from left side:

-2xu - 2yv - (2xu + 2yv) = 0

So, -4xu -4yv = 0

Divide both sides by -4:

xu + yv = 0

Wait, but from equation 3, we had yv + xu = 0. So, this
