Okay, so I have this geometry problem here. Let me read it again to make sure I understand what's being asked.

"Let triangle ABC have circumcenter O and incenter I with IA perpendicular to OI, circumradius 13, and inradius 6. Find AB·AC."

Alright, so I need to find the product of the lengths of sides AB and AC in triangle ABC. They've given me some information about the circumradius (which is 13) and the inradius (which is 6). Also, it's given that IA is perpendicular to OI. Hmm, okay.

Let me jot down what I remember about triangle centers like the circumcenter and incenter.

The circumradius (R) is the radius of the circumscribed circle around the triangle, and the inradius (r) is the radius of the inscribed circle. The circumcenter O is the intersection of the perpendicular bisectors of the triangle's sides, and the incenter I is where the angle bisectors meet.

They mention that IA is perpendicular to OI. That seems important. So the line from the incenter I to vertex A is perpendicular to the line from the incenter I to the circumcenter O. That must create some right angle there.

I need to find AB·AC. In triangle problems, sometimes it's helpful to use formulas that relate sides, inradius, and circumradius.

I recall that the area (Δ) of the triangle can be expressed in terms of the inradius and semi-perimeter (s) as Δ = r*s. Also, the area can be expressed using the circumradius as Δ = (a*b*c)/(4R), where a, b, c are the sides of the triangle. But I'm not sure if that's directly helpful here.

Wait, the problem is asking for AB·AC. Let me denote AB as c, BC as a, and AC as b. So AB·AC would be c*b. Hmm.

I also remember that in a triangle, the product of two sides can sometimes be related to other triangle properties. Maybe I can find some relations using the given information about the inradius and circumradius.

Given that IA is perpendicular to OI, perhaps I can use coordinate geometry or vector methods, but maybe it's simpler with synthetic geometry.

Let me think about the properties of O and I. The Euler line connects O, I, and the centroid G, but in this case, IA is perpendicular to OI, which is a different condition. Not sure if Euler line properties will help here.

Alternatively, I can use coordinate geometry by placing the triangle in a coordinate system. Maybe place point I at the origin to simplify calculations, or perhaps place point A somewhere specific.

Wait, if I can find coordinates for O and I, then I can use the condition that IA is perpendicular to OI.

Let me try setting up a coordinate system. Let's place the incenter I at the origin (0,0). Then, since IA is perpendicular to OI, and I is at (0,0), let's assume point A is along the x-axis. So point A is at (d, 0) for some d. Then, the line IA is along the x-axis.

Since IA is perpendicular to OI, the line OI must be vertical. Because if IA is horizontal, then OI must be vertical to be perpendicular. So point O must lie somewhere along the y-axis.

So O is at (0, e) for some e. Since the circumradius is 13, the distance from O to A is 13. So OA = 13. The distance from O(0,e) to A(d,0) is sqrt((d-0)^2 + (0 - e)^2) = sqrt(d^2 + e^2). So sqrt(d^2 + e^2) = 13, which gives d^2 + e^2 = 169. (1)

Also, the inradius is 6. The inradius is the distance from the incenter I to any side of the triangle. Since I is at (0,0), and in a coordinate system where A is at (d,0), the coordinates of other points can be tricky, but perhaps I can find the sides in terms of coordinates.

Alternatively, maybe I can use some formula that relates the distance between the incenter and circumradius. I remember that the distance between O and I is sqrt(R(R - 2r)), but wait, is that correct?

Yes, there's a formula: OI^2 = R(R - 2r). Let me verify that. I think that's correct because in triangle geometry, the distance between the incenter and circumcenter is related by OI² = R² - 2Rr. Hmm, wait, maybe I got the sign wrong.

Wait, the formula I remember is OI² = R² - 2Rr. So OI squared is R squared minus twice R times r.

Given that R is 13 and r is 6, OI² = 13² - 2*13*6 = 169 - 156 = 13. So OI is sqrt(13). Hmm.

But wait, in our coordinate system, O is at (0,e) and I is at (0,0), so the distance OI is |e|. So |e| = sqrt(13). Therefore, e is either sqrt(13) or -sqrt(13). But since O is the circumradius center, depending on the triangle's orientation, e could be positive or negative, but let's just take e as sqrt(13) for simplicity. So O is at (0, sqrt(13)).

From equation (1), d² + e² = 169. Since e² is 13, d² = 169 -13 = 156. So d is sqrt(156) or -sqrt(156). Let's take d as positive, so A is at (sqrt(156), 0).

Wait, sqrt(156) can be simplified. 156 = 4*39 = 4*3*13, so sqrt(156) = 2*sqrt(39). So point A is at (2√39, 0).

Now, in this coordinate system, I is at (0,0), O is at (0, sqrt(13)), and A is at (2√39, 0). Now, I need to find AB * AC.

Alternatively, maybe I can find the coordinates of B and C and then compute AB and AC.

Wait, but that might be complicated. Let me think about other triangle properties.

Since I is the incenter, the distances from I to each side are equal to the inradius (6). Maybe I can find the coordinates of B and C such that their distances to I are 6, but I'm not sure.

Wait, in our coordinate system, I is at (0,0). So the sides of the triangle must be tangent to the incircle of radius 6. Hmm, but how can I relate this to the coordinates of B and C?

Alternatively, maybe I can use the fact that O is the circumradius center, so it's equidistant from all three vertices. So OA=OB=OC=13.

We know OA is 13, which we've already used. So OB and OC are also 13.

So points B and C lie on the circle centered at O(0, sqrt(13)) with radius 13. Therefore, their coordinates (x, y) must satisfy x² + (y - sqrt(13))² = 169.

Also, since I is the incenter at (0,0), the angles bisectors meet at I. So the coordinates of B and C must satisfy the angle bisector conditions.

Hmm, this is getting a bit complicated. Maybe there's another approach.

Wait, another thought: In triangle ABC, the length of AI can be found using the formula AI = r / sin(A/2), where r is the inradius and A is the angle at vertex A. But I'm not sure about that. Alternatively, there's a formula for the distance from the incenter to a vertex.

Yes, the formula for AI is (r) / sin(A/2). Let me confirm that.

Wait, I think the formula is AI = (r) / sin(A/2). So if I can find angle A, maybe I can find AI.

But I don't know angle A yet. Alternatively, since IA is perpendicular to OI, which in our coordinate system is along the x-axis and y-axis respectively, perhaps we can find some relations.

Wait, in our coordinate system, IA is along the x-axis from I(0,0) to A(2√39, 0). OI is along the y-axis from I(0,0) to O(0, sqrt(13)). So the angle between IA and OI is 90 degrees, which is consistent with the given condition.

Now, since O is the circumradius center, points B and C lie on the circle centered at (0, sqrt(13)) with radius 13.

So the coordinates of B and C are points on this circle. Additionally, since I is the incenter, the distances from I to each side are equal to 6. Hmm, but how do I relate that?

Alternatively, perhaps I can use the formula that relates AI with other elements.

Wait, another formula: In any triangle, the distance from the incenter to vertex A is given by AI = (2R sin(A/2)), but wait, I'm not sure. Let me think.

Wait, perhaps using trigonometric identities in triangle AIO.

Since IA is perpendicular to OI, triangle AIO is a right-angled triangle at I. So in triangle AIO, we have:

AI^2 + OI^2 = AO^2.

Wait, no, because IA is perpendicular to OI, so triangle AIO is right-angled at I. So the legs are AI and IO, and the hypotenuse is AO.

Wait, AO is the distance from A to O, which we already know is 13. So AI^2 + IO^2 = AO^2.

We know AO =13, IO = sqrt(13), so AI^2 + (sqrt(13))^2 = 13^2.

That gives AI^2 + 13 = 169.

So AI^2 = 169 -13=156, so AI = sqrt(156) = 2*sqrt(39). Which matches the coordinate we had earlier, since point A is at (2√39, 0), so the distance from I(0,0) to A is 2√39, which is AI. So that's consistent.

So, AI is 2√39. Now, AI is also given by the formula AI = r / sin(A/2). Wait, is that correct? Let me check.

Wait, I think in a triangle, AI can be expressed as AI = r / sin(A/2). Is that correct? Alternatively, I think AI = (r)/sin(A/2). Let me verify.

Yes, I found a formula that says AI = r / sin(A/2). So if AI is 2√39, then 2√39 = r / sin(A/2). Given that r is 6, so:

2√39 = 6 / sin(A/2)

So sin(A/2) = 6 / (2√39) = 3 / √39 = √39 / 13. Wait, that's because 3/√39 = (3√39)/39 = √39/13.

So sin(A/2) = √39 /13.

Hmm, okay. Now, let's think about angle A. Let me denote angle A as α. So α/2 is the angle whose sine is √39 /13.

So sin(α/2) = √39 /13. Then, cos(α/2) can be found using the identity sin²θ + cos²θ =1.

So cos(α/2) = sqrt(1 - (√39/13)^2 ) = sqrt(1 - 39/169) = sqrt(130/169) = sqrt(130)/13.

So now, I can find sin α using the double-angle formula:

sin α = 2 sin(α/2) cos(α/2) = 2*(√39/13)*(sqrt(130)/13) = 2*sqrt(39*130)/(13^2).

Let me compute that. 39*130 = 39*130 = 5070. So sqrt(5070). Hmm, 5070 factors: 5070=10*507=10*3*169=10*3*13². So sqrt(5070)=sqrt(10*3*13²)=13*sqrt(30).

So sin α = 2*(13*sqrt(30))/(13^2) ) = 2*sqrt(30)/13.

So sin α = 2√30 /13.

Now, in triangle ABC, the area can be expressed as (1/2)*AB*AC*sin α. Since AB is c, AC is b, and sin α is 2√30 /13, the area Δ = (1/2)*b*c*(2√30 /13) = (b*c*√30)/13.

But also, the area can be expressed as r*s, where r is the inradius (6) and s is the semi-perimeter. So Δ =6s.

So 6s = (b c √30)/13.

So, 6s = (b c √30)/13.

Hmm, that gives one equation. But I need another to relate b and c.

Alternatively, I can use the formula that relates the sides and the circumradius: a/(2 sin A) = 2R. Wait, actually, the formula is a = 2R sin A, where a is the side opposite angle A. Wait, so in our case, side BC is a, so a = 2R sin A.

Wait, R is 13, so a = 2*13*sin α = 26*(2√30 /13) )= 4√30.

Wait, because sin α is 2√30 /13, so a = 26*(2√30 /13) )= 2*2√30 =4√30.

So side BC is a = 4√30.

Now, the semi-perimeter s = (a + b + c)/2.

So s = (4√30 + b + c)/2.

We have Δ =6s = (b c √30)/13.

So, let's write that as 6*(4√30 + b + c)/2 = (b c √30)/13.

Simplify the left side: 6*( (4√30 + b + c)/2 ) = 3*(4√30 + b + c) =12√30 + 3b +3c.

So, 12√30 +3b +3c = (b c √30)/13.

Hmm, that seems a bit messy. Maybe I can find another relation.

Wait, perhaps I can use the formula that relates the sides of the triangle to the inradius and semi-perimeter. The area is also equal to r*s =6s.

Another formula: In a triangle, the product of the lengths of two sides can be related to the area and the sine of the included angle. Wait, that's what I used earlier.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use the relation involving the distance between the inradius and circumradius. But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps using the formula for the distance between O and I:

OI² = R(R - 2r) → which we've already used (OI² =13). So that was helpful.

Alternatively, maybe I can use the formula that relates AI with other elements.

Wait, AI is 2√39, which we found earlier. AI is also equal to (r)/sin(A/2), which we used to find sin(A/2).

Alternatively, another formula: In a triangle, the length of AI can be expressed as AI = (sqrt(b c s (s - a)) ) / s, where s is the semi-perimeter. Wait, I'm not sure about that. Maybe I need to think differently.

Wait, perhaps using the formula for the length of the angle bisector. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe using coordinates. Since I have the position of O and I, and A, maybe I can find coordinates for B and C.

In our coordinate system, A is at (2√39,0), I is at (0,0), and O is at (0, sqrt(13)). So the inradius is 6, so the inradius circle is centered at I(0,0) with radius 6.

Now, points B and C lie on the circumcircle centered at O(0, sqrt(13)) with radius 13. So their coordinates satisfy x² + (y - sqrt(13))² = 169.

Also, since I is the incenter, the lines from I to B and I to C are angle bisectors. Hmm, but I'm not sure how to use that.

Alternatively, maybe I can find the equations of the sides AB and AC.

Since I is the incenter, the distance from I to side BC is equal to the inradius, which is 6.

Wait, but in our coordinate system, point A is at (2√39, 0), I is at (0,0), O is at (0, sqrt(13)).

Hmm, perhaps I can find equations for the sides AB and AC. Since the inradius is 6, the distance from I(0,0) to the sides AB and AC must be 6.

Wait, the distance from I to AB is 6. Let's find the equation of line AB. Since point A is (2√39, 0) and point B is somewhere on the circumcircle.

Hmm, but without knowing where B is, this might not help.

Alternatively, maybe I can use the fact that the area is 6s, and also area is (1/2)*base*height.

Wait, but I need more relations.

Alternatively, maybe I can use the formula for the distance between the incenter and the circumradius. Wait, we already used that, OI²=13.

Wait, perhaps I can express the sides in terms of the coordinates.

Points B and C lie on the circumcircle, so their coordinates (x, y) satisfy x² + (y - sqrt(13))² =169.

Also, since I is the incenter, the distances from I to sides AB, BC, and AC are all equal to 6.

So, for example, the distance from I(0,0) to line AB is 6.

Let me try to find the equation of line AB. Since A is at (2√39,0), and B is at (x, y), the equation of AB can be written as:

(y - 0) = m (x - 2√39), where m is the slope.

But the distance from I(0,0) to this line is |0 - m*(0 - 2√39)| / sqrt(m² +1) )= |2√39 m| / sqrt(m² +1) )=6.

So, |2√39 m| = 6 sqrt(m² +1).

Squaring both sides: (4*39)m² = 36(m² +1).

So 156 m² =36 m² +36.

Subtract 36m²: 120 m² =36.

So m²=36/120=3/10. So m=±√(3/10)=±(√30)/10.

So the slope of AB is either √30/10 or -√30/10.

Wait, but since point A is at (2√39,0) and point B is another vertex, the slope can be positive or negative depending on the position of B.

But since the triangle is not specified to be oriented in any particular way, perhaps we can assume that the slope is positive, but I need to think about it.

Wait, but in reality, the triangle could be oriented either way, but since the inradius is inside the triangle, the sides must be such that the inradius is enclosed.

But maybe for simplicity, let's proceed with one slope, say positive, and see if it works.

So slope m=√30/10.

So the equation of line AB is y = (√30/10)(x - 2√39).

Similarly, the equation of line AC can be found, but perhaps it's symmetric.

Wait, but I don't know where point C is. Maybe I can use the fact that points B and C lie on the circumcircle, and their distances from I are such that the inradius is 6.

But this is getting complicated. Maybe I should find coordinates for points B and C.

Alternatively, perhaps I can find AB and AC using the Law of Cosines.

Wait, I know angle A, right? Because we found sin α = 2√30 /13, so we can find cos α using sin²α + cos²α =1.

So cos α = sqrt(1 - ( (2√30)/13 )² ) = sqrt(1 - (4*30)/169 )= sqrt(1 - 120/169 )= sqrt(49/169 )=7/13.

So cos α =7/13.

Now, using the Law of Cosines on angle A:

BC² = AB² + AC² - 2 AB AC cos α.

But BC is a, which we found as 4√30. So (4√30)^2 = AB² + AC² - 2 AB AC*(7/13).

So 16*30= AB² + AC² - (14/13) AB AC.

Calculating 16*30=480.

So 480 = c² + b² - (14/13) b c.

Hmm, since we need to find AB·AC =b c. Let me denote k =b c.

So, 480= b² + c² - (14/13)k.

But I also know that in a triangle, the area can be expressed as (1/2)ab sin C, but in this case, we have two expressions for the area.

Earlier, we had Δ =6s and Δ=(k√30)/13.

So 6s = (k√30)/13.

But s is the semi-perimeter: s=(a +b +c)/2 = (4√30 +b +c)/2.

So 6*(4√30 +b +c)/2 = (k√30)/13.

Simplify: 3*(4√30 +b +c) = (k√30)/13.

So 12√30 +3b +3c = (k√30)/13.

Hmm, so 12√30 +3b +3c = (k√30)/13.

But I also have the equation from the Law of Cosines: 480 =b² +c² -(14/13)k.

This is getting a bit involved, but maybe I can find another equation involving b and c.

Wait, another formula: In a triangle, the product of two sides can be related to the circumradius and the sine of the opposite angle. For example, a=2R sin A, which we used earlier. Similarly, b=2R sin B and c=2R sin C.

But since I don't know angles B and C, that might not help directly.

Alternatively, maybe I can express b and c in terms of k and use the equations I have.

Let me denote k= b c.

I have 480= b² + c² - (14/13)k.

And from the area equation: 12√30 +3b +3c = (k√30)/13.

Hmm, so two equations with variables b, c, and k. But I need a third equation.

Wait, but I have another relation. The semi-perimeter s is (4√30 +b +c)/2. Also, the inradius r=6, so area Δ=6s.

We also have Δ=(k√30)/13. So 6s = (k√30)/13.

So, s= (k√30)/(13*6) )= (k√30)/78.

But s is also (4√30 +b +c)/2.

So, (4√30 +b +c)/2 = (k√30)/78.

Multiply both sides by 2: 4√30 +b +c = (2k√30)/78 = (k√30)/39.

So, 4√30 +b +c= (k√30)/39.

So, from the area equation: 12√30 +3b +3c = (k√30)/13.

Let me write down both equations:

1. 480 = b² +c² - (14/13)k.

2. 12√30 +3b +3c = (k√30)/13.

3. 4√30 +b +c = (k√30)/39.

Wait, equation 3 can be rearranged to express (b + c) in terms of k.

From equation 3: b +c = (k√30)/39 -4√30.

Similarly, equation 2: 3(b +c) = (k√30)/13 -12√30.

Substituting b +c from equation 3 into equation 2:

3[ (k√30)/39 -4√30 ] = (k√30)/13 -12√30.

Compute left side: 3*(k√30)/39 - 3*4√30 = (k√30)/13 -12√30.

Which is equal to the right side: (k√30)/13 -12√30.

So, the left side equals the right side, which is an identity. So, this doesn't give us a new equation. So I need another approach.

Hmm, maybe express b² +c² in terms of (b +c)^2 - 2bc.

From equation 3: b +c= (k√30)/39 -4√30.

So, (b + c)^2 = [ (k√30)/39 -4√30 ]^2 = (k√30 /39)^2 - 2*(k√30 /39)*(4√30) + (4√30)^2.

Let me compute each term:

First term: (k√30 /39)^2 = (k² *30 )/(39²) = (30 k²)/1521.

Second term: 2*(k√30 /39)*(4√30) = 2*(4k *30)/39 = (240k)/39.

Wait, wait, let me compute it correctly.

Actually, the second term is -2*(k√30 /39)*(4√30) = -2*k*4*(√30 *√30)/39 = -8k*(30)/39 = -240k/39.

Third term: (4√30)^2=16*30=480.

So, (b + c)^2 = (30k²/1521) - (240k/39) +480.

Then, b² +c² = (b +c)^2 - 2bc = [30k²/1521 -240k/39 +480] - 2k.

Because bc=k, so 2bc=2k.

So, b² +c²= 30k²/1521 -240k/39 +480 -2k.

Now, substitute this into equation 1:

480= [30k²/1521 -240k/39 +480 -2k] - (14/13)k.

Simplify the right side:

30k²/1521 -240k/39 +480 -2k -14k/13.

Convert all terms to have a common denominator, perhaps 1521.

But that might be tedious. Alternatively, let me compute each term as fractions.

First, 30k²/1521 remains as is.

-240k/39: 39 divides into 1521 as 1521/39=39. So 39*39=1521. So, -240k/39 = (-240k *39)/1521.

Wait, but maybe better to write all terms with denominator 1521.

30k²/1521 is already that.

-240k/39 = -240k * (1521/39) /1521. Wait, 1521 divided by 39 is 39, so 240k/39 = 240k /39 = 240k * (39)/1521? Wait, no.

Wait, perhaps it's better to compute each term as fractions.

Alternatively, let me express all terms in terms of k:

So equation becomes:

480 = [30k²/1521 -240k/39 +480 -2k] - (14/13)k.

Let me bring all terms to the left:

480 - [30k²/1521 -240k/39 +480 -2k] + (14/13)k =0.

Simplify term by term:

480 -30k²/1521 +240k/39 -480 +2k +14k/13 =0.

Simplify:

480-480 cancels out.

So: -30k²/1521 +240k/39 +2k +14k/13 =0.

Combine like terms.

Let me convert all k terms to a common denominator, say 1521.

Wait, 240k/39 = 240k * (39) / (39*39) )= 240k*39/1521. Wait, actually, 240k/39 = (240k * 39)/ (39*39) )= (240k *39)/1521.

Wait, no, that's not correct.

Wait, 240k/39 = (240k * (1521/39)) /1521. Since 1521/39=39.

So 240k/39 = (240k *39)/1521 = (9360k)/1521.

Similarly, 2k = 2k*(1521/1521)=3042k/1521.

14k/13=14k*(117/1521)=1638k/1521.

So putting it all together:

-30k²/1521 +9360k/1521 +3042k/1521 +1638k/1521=0.

Combine the k terms:

(9360k +3042k +1638k) = (9360 +3042 +1638)k.

Compute numerator:

9360 +3042=12402; 12402 +1638=14040.

So, total k term: 14040k.

So equation becomes:

(-30k² +14040k)/1521=0.

Multiply both sides by 1521:

-30k² +14040k=0.

Factor out -30k:

-30k(k - 14040/30)=0 → -30k(k -468)=0.

So, solutions are k=0 or k=468.

Since k=bc cannot be zero, k=468.

So, AB·AC =b c=468.

Wait, so the answer is 468. Hmm.

Let me check if this makes sense.

We had a right-angled triangle in terms of the inradius and circumradius, and through the equations, we arrived at bc=468.

So, after all that, the product AB·AC is 468.


To solve the problem, we start by noting the given information: triangle \( \triangle ABC \) has a circumradius \( R = 13 \), inradius \( r = 6 \), and \( \overline{IA} \perp \overline{OI} \). We aim to find \( AB \cdot AC \).

1. **Distance between Incenter and Circumcenter**:
   Using the formula \( OI^2 = R(R - 2r) \), we calculate:
   \[
   OI^2 = 13(13 - 2 \cdot 6) = 13 \cdot 1 = 13 \implies OI = \sqrt{13}.
   \]

2. **Right Triangle \( \triangle AIO \)**:
   Since \( \overline{IA} \perp \overline{OI} \), triangle \( \triangle AIO \) is right-angled at \( I \). By the Pythagorean theorem:
   \[
   AI^2 + OI^2 = AO^2 \implies AI^2 + 13 = 13^2 \implies AI^2 = 156 \implies AI = 2\sqrt{39}.
   \]

3. **Angle \( A \) and Trigonometric Relations**:
   Using \( AI = \frac{r}{\sin(A/2)} \), we find:
   \[
   2\sqrt{39} = \frac{6}{\sin(A/2)} \implies \sin(A/2) = \frac{\sqrt{39}}{13}.
   \]
   Then, \( \cos(A/2) = \sqrt{1 - \left(\frac{\sqrt{39}}{13}\right)^2} = \frac{\sqrt{130}}{13} \).

   Using the double-angle formula for sine:
   \[
   \sin A = 2 \sin(A/2) \cos(A/2) = 2 \cdot \frac{\sqrt{39}}{13} \cdot \frac{\sqrt{130}}{13} = \frac{2\sqrt{30}}{13}.
   \]

4. **Side Length \( BC \)**:
   Using the Law of Sines:
   \[
   BC = 2R \sin A = 2 \cdot 13 \cdot \frac{2\sqrt{30}}{13} = 4\sqrt{30}.
   \]

5. **Area of \( \triangle ABC \)**:
   The area \( \Delta \) can be expressed in two ways:
   \[
   \Delta = r \cdot s = 6s \quad \text{and} \quad \Delta = \frac{1}{2} AB \cdot AC \cdot \sin A.
   \]
   Equating these:
   \[
   6s = \frac{1}{2} AB \cdot AC \cdot \frac{2\sqrt{30}}{13} \implies 6s = \frac{AB \cdot AC \cdot \sqrt{30}}{13}.
   \]

6. **Semi-perimeter \( s \)**:
   Let \( AB = c \), \( AC = b \), and \( BC = a = 4\sqrt{30} \). The semi-perimeter is:
   \[
   s = \frac{a + b + c}{2}.
   \]

7. **Product \( AB \cdot AC \)**:
   Using the area relation and solving the system of equations derived from the given conditions, we find:
   \[
   AB \cdot AC = 468.
   \]

Thus, the product \( AB \cdot AC \) is \(\boxed{468}\).
