Okay, so I have this math problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again.

It says: Let N be the greatest four-digit positive integer with the property that whenever one of its digits is changed to 1, the resulting number is divisible by 7. Then, Q and R are the quotient and remainder when N is divided by 1000. We need to find Q + R.

Hmm, okay. So N is a four-digit number, which means it's between 1000 and 9999. It's the greatest such number with a specific property. The property is that if you change any one of its digits to 1, the new number is divisible by 7.

First, I need to understand what this property implies about the original number N. Let's break it down.

Suppose N is represented as a four-digit number: N = ABCD, where A, B, C, D are its digits. So A is the thousands digit, B is hundreds, C is tens, and D is units.

The condition is that if we replace any one digit with 1, the resulting number is divisible by 7. So, for example, replacing A with 1 gives 1BCD, which should be divisible by 7. Similarly, replacing B with 1 gives A1CD, which should be divisible by 7, and so on for replacing C and D.

So, for each digit position, changing that digit to 1 results in a number that's a multiple of 7.

I need to find the largest such four-digit number N. Once I find N, then Q is N divided by 1000, so Q is the thousands digit times 1, plus the hundreds digit times 0.1, but wait, no. Wait, when you divide N by 1000, the quotient Q is the integer division, so Q is the thousands digit, and R is the remainder, which is the last three digits. So, for example, if N is 9876, then Q is 9 and R is 876, so Q + R would be 9 + 876 = 885.

But first, I need to find N.

Let me think about how to approach this. Since N is the greatest four-digit number with this property, perhaps I can start checking from 9999 downwards until I find such an N. But that's not efficient. Maybe there's a smarter way.

Let me consider the structure of N.

Since changing any digit to 1 makes the number divisible by 7, perhaps N has some properties related to mod 7.

Let me consider each possible change:

1. Changing the thousands digit (A) to 1: the new number is 1BCD. So 1000 + 100B + 10C + D must be divisible by 7.

2. Changing the hundreds digit (B) to 1: the new number is A1CD. So 1000A + 100 + 10C + D must be divisible by 7.

3. Changing the tens digit (C) to 1: the new number is AB1D. So 1000A + 100B + 10 + D must be divisible by 7.

4. Changing the units digit (D) to 1: the new number is ABC1. So 1000A + 100B + 10C + 1 must be divisible by 7.

So each of these four modified numbers must be ≡ 0 mod 7.

Let me write these conditions as equations.

Let’s denote the original number N as 1000A + 100B + 10C + D.

Then:

1. 1000 + 100B + 10C + D ≡ 0 mod 7.

2. 1000A + 100 + 10C + D ≡ 0 mod 7.

3. 1000A + 100B + 10 + D ≡ 0 mod 7.

4. 1000A + 100B + 10C + 1 ≡ 0 mod 7.

So we have four congruence conditions.

Let me compute each of these modulo 7.

First, let's find the values of 1000, 100, 10, and 1 modulo 7.

Compute 10^0 mod7 =1.

10^1 mod7=3, because 10/7=1*7+3.

10^2 mod7= 3*10 mod7= 30 mod7. 30/7=4*7=28, so 30 mod7=2.

10^3 mod7= 2*10=20 mod7= 20-2*7=6.

So:

1000 ≡ 6 mod7,

100 ≡ 2 mod7,

10 ≡3 mod7,

1 ≡1 mod7.

So, let's rewrite each condition using these.

1. 1000 + 100B +10C + D ≡ (6) + (2)B + (3)C + D ≡0 mod7.

2. 1000A + 100 +10C + D ≡ (6)A + (2) + (3)C + D ≡0 mod7.

3. 1000A + 100B +10 + D ≡ (6)A + (2)B + (3) + D ≡0 mod7.

4. 1000A +100B +10C +1 ≡ (6)A + (2)B + (3)C +1 ≡0 mod7.

So, we have four equations:

1. 6 + 2B + 3C + D ≡0 mod7. (Equation 1)

2. 6A + 2 + 3C + D ≡0 mod7. (Equation 2)

3. 6A + 2B + 3 + D ≡0 mod7. (Equation 3)

4. 6A + 2B + 3C +1 ≡0 mod7. (Equation 4)

Our goal is to find A, B, C, D such that all four equations are satisfied, and N is as large as possible.

Moreover, since N is a four-digit number, A can't be zero.

Let me denote N as ABCD, so N = 1000A + 100B + 10C + D.

Our goal is to maximize N, so we want to maximize A first, then B, then C, then D.

So, let's try to find the largest possible A (from 9 down), then for each A, find the largest possible B, etc., satisfying the four equations.

Let me see if I can manipulate these equations to express D in terms of A, B, C, and then see how that affects N.

Let me start by writing the four equations:

Equation 1: 6 + 2B + 3C + D ≡0 mod7.

Equation 2:6A + 2 + 3C + D ≡0 mod7.

Equation 3:6A + 2B + 3 + D ≡0 mod7.

Equation 4:6A + 2B + 3C +1 ≡0 mod7.

Let me subtract equation 1 from equation 2.

Equation 2 - Equation 1:

(6A + 2 + 3C + D) - (6 + 2B + 3C + D) = 6A + 2 -6 -2B = 6A -2B -4.

This should be ≡0 mod7.

So, 6A -2B -4 ≡0 mod7.

Simplify: 6A -2B ≡4 mod7.

Divide both sides by 2: 3A - B ≡2 mod7. (Equation 5)

Similarly, let's subtract equation 1 from equation 3.

Equation3 - Equation1:

(6A + 2B +3 + D) - (6 + 2B +3C + D) =6A +3 + D -6 -3C - D =6A -3C -3.

This should be ≡0 mod7.

So, 6A -3C -3 ≡0 mod7.

Simplify: 6A -3C ≡3 mod7.

Divide both sides by 3: 2A - C ≡1 mod7. (Equation 6)

Next, subtract equation 1 from equation4.

Equation4 - Equation1:

(6A +2B +3C +1) - (6 +2B +3C + D) =6A +1 -6 - D =6A -5 - D.

This should be ≡0 mod7.

So, 6A - D -5 ≡0 mod7.

Thus, 6A - D ≡5 mod7. (Equation7)

Now, let's see if we can express D from Equation1.

From Equation1: 6 + 2B +3C + D ≡0 mod7.

So, D ≡ -6 -2B -3C mod7.

Similarly, from Equation7: 6A - D ≡5 mod7 → D ≡6A -5 mod7.

So, we have two expressions for D:

D ≡ (-6 -2B -3C) mod7,

and

D ≡ (6A -5) mod7.

Therefore:

-6 -2B -3C ≡6A -5 mod7.

Simplify:

(-6 +5) -2B -3C -6A ≡0 mod7.

Which is:

-1 -2B -3C -6A ≡0 mod7.

Multiply both sides by -1:

1 + 2B +3C +6A ≡0 mod7.

So:

6A +2B +3C ≡-1 mod7 → 6A +2B +3C ≡6 mod7 (since -1 ≡6 mod7).

Let me note this as Equation8.

Now, from Equation5: 3A - B ≡2 mod7.

From Equation6: 2A - C ≡1 mod7.

Equation8:6A +2B +3C ≡6 mod7.

Let me try to express B and C in terms of A.

From Equation5: B ≡3A -2 mod7.

From Equation6: C ≡2A -1 mod7.

So, let's substitute B and C into Equation8.

Equation8:6A +2B +3C ≡6 mod7.

Substitute B=3A-2, C=2A-1.

6A +2*(3A -2) +3*(2A -1) ≡6 mod7.

Compute each term:

6A + (6A -4) + (6A -3) =6A +6A -4 +6A -3 = 18A -7.

18A -7 ≡6 mod7.

18 mod7 is 4 (because 7*2=14, 18-14=4). So 4A -7 ≡6 mod7.

But -7 ≡0 mod7, so 4A ≡6 mod7.

So 4A ≡6 mod7.

Multiply both sides by the modular inverse of 4 mod7. Since 4*2=8≡1 mod7, so inverse of 4 is 2.

Therefore, A ≡6*2=12≡5 mod7.

So A ≡5 mod7.

Since A is a digit, it can be 5 or 12, but 12 is invalid as a digit. So A must be 5.

Wait, but I thought we were trying to maximize N, so we'd want A to be as large as possible, starting from 9. But according to this, A must be 5 mod7. So possible A values are 5 and 12, but since A is a digit, A can be 5 only.

Wait, but 5 mod7 is 5, but 5+7=12 which is more than 9, so only 5.

Wait, but that can't be right because if A must be 5, then the maximum N would be 5999, but that seems too low. Maybe I made a mistake.

Wait, wait, let me go back.

Wait, perhaps I made an error in the substitution.

Wait, in Equation8, after substitution, I had 18A -7 ≡6 mod7.

But 18 mod7 is 4, so 4A -7 ≡6 mod7.

But -7 mod7 is 0, so 4A ≡6 mod7. So 4A ≡6 mod7.

So A ≡6 * (4^{-1}) mod7.

Since 4*2=8≡1 mod7, so 4^{-1}=2 mod7.

So, A ≡6*2=12≡5 mod7.

So A must be ≡5 mod7. So A can be 5 or 12, but since A is a digit (0-9), only 5 is possible.

Wait, that would mean the maximum A is 5, but that seems wrong because if we can have
