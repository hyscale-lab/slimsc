Okay, so I have this problem about a convex equilateral hexagon where all pairs of opposite sides are parallel. They also mention that the triangle formed by extending segments AB, CD, and EF has side lengths of 200, 240, and 300. I need to find the side length of the hexagon.

Hmm, let me break this down. First, an equilateral hexagon means all its sides are equal in length, but it's not necessarily regular because the angles might not be equal. However, all pairs of opposite sides are parallel, which might give it some symmetry. 

I remember that in a convex hexagon with opposite sides parallel, it's sometimes called a "zonogon." For such hexagons, there are certain properties related to their sides and the triangles formed by extending them.

The problem mentions that the triangle formed by extending AB, CD, and EF has sides 200, 240, and 300. So, let me visualize this. If I extend AB, CD, and EF, they meet to form a triangle. Each of these sides is extended beyond their original points, right?

Since the hexagon is equilateral, each side has the same length, let's call it 's'. Now, the triangle formed by these extensions has sides 200, 240, and 300. I think I need to relate these lengths to 's' somehow.

I recall that in such a hexagon, the sides can be thought of as vectors. Since opposite sides are parallel, their vectors are scalar multiples of each other. But since the hexagon is convex and equilateral, the vectors must form a closed loop, so the sum of all vectors is zero.

Wait, perhaps I should consider the concept of similar triangles here. The triangle formed by the extensions (let's call it triangle XYZ) with sides 200, 240, 300, is similar to some smaller triangles within the hexagon.

Alternatively, maybe I can use coordinate geometry. Let me try assigning coordinates to the hexagon's vertices and see if I can find relationships between the sides.

Let me denote the vertices as A, B, C, D, E, F in order. Since opposite sides are parallel, AB || DE, BC || EF, and CD || FA.

Since all sides are equal, AB = BC = CD = DE = EF = FA = s.

Now, when we extend AB, CD, and EF, these lines meet to form triangle XYZ with sides 200, 240, 300. Let me think about the ratios between these sides and the sides of the hexagon.

Wait, another approach: In a convex hexagon with opposite sides parallel, the extensions of the sides form a larger triangle, and the hexagon can be seen as a sort of truncated version of this triangle. So, the sides of the hexagon might be related proportionally to the sides of triangle XYZ.

I think the key here is to use the concept of similar triangles and the ratios of the sides.

Suppose that the triangle XYZ is similar to the inner triangle formed by the hexagon. Wait, but the hexagon isn't a triangle, so maybe each pair of extended sides divides the triangle into smaller similar triangles.
