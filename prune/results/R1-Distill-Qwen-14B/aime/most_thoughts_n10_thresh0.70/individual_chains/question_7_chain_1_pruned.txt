Okay, so I've got this probability problem about coloring the vertices of a regular octagon either red or blue. Each vertex is colored independently with equal probability, so that's a 50-50 chance for each color. The question is about finding the probability that there's a rotation of the octagon such that all the blue vertices end up where there were originally red vertices, and vice versa.

Hmm, let me try to parse this. So, the octagon is regular, meaning all sides and angles are equal, so it has rotational symmetry. Each vertex is either red or blue, with each color having a 1/2 chance. We need to find the probability that after some rotation (by 0°, 45°, 90°, etc.), all the blue vertices move to positions that were previously red, and all reds move to where blues were. Wait, is that exactly what's happening? Or does it mean that after rotation, all the blue ones are on red positions, but the reds can be anywhere?

Wait, the problem says: "the octagon can then be rotated so that all of the blue vertices end up at positions where there were originally red vertices." So, the rotated octagon must have all blue vertices where the original had red. But what about the reds? Do they end up on blue positions? I think so, because a rotation is a permutation of the positions. So, if all blue vertices are mapped to red positions, then all red vertices must be mapped to blue positions. So, it's a kind of swapping.

But wait, maybe the problem only requires that the blue vertices end up on red positions, regardless of where the reds go. But given the phrasing, I think it's a bijection: the rotation must map blue vertices to red positions and red vertices to blue positions. So, in effect, the coloring must be such that there's a rotation which is an involution swapping red and blue.

Wait, but not necessarily an involution. Because the rotation can be any multiple of 45°, right? So, for a regular octagon, the possible rotations are by 0°, 45°, 90°, 135°, 180°, 225°, 270°, and 315°, which are the rotational symmetries of the octagon.

Now, the key is that the coloring must be such
