Okay, so I have this geometry problem here, and I need to figure out the value of OC squared, where C is a specific point on segment AB. Let me try to unpack the problem step by step.

First, the points given are O at (0,0), A at (1/2, 0), and B at (0, sqrt(3)/2). So, O is the origin, A is on the x-axis, and B is on the y-axis. The segment AB connects these two points. I can imagine this as a line from (1/2, 0) to (0, sqrt(3)/2).

Next, there's this family of segments F, which are all segments PQ of unit length lying in the first quadrant. Each segment has point P on the x-axis and Q on the y-axis. So, for each such segment, P would be at some point (p, 0) and Q at (0, q), and the distance between them is 1. Since the distance formula between (p,0) and (0,q) is sqrt(p² + q²), that must equal 1. So, sqrt(p² + q²) = 1 implies p² + q² = 1.

So, all the segments PQ in F are of the form from (p, 0) to (0, q) where p and q satisfy p² + q² = 1. These segments lie entirely in the first quadrant, so p and q are positive.

Now, the problem states that there is a unique point C on AB (distinct from A and B) that does not belong to any segment from F other than AB itself. So, C is a point on AB such that no other segment PQ in F (besides AB) passes through C.

I need to find OC², which is the square of the distance from the origin to point C. The answer will be a fraction p/q, and I have to find p + q where they are coprime.

So, my goal is to find the coordinates of point C on AB such that it's only on AB and no other PQ from F. Then, compute OC².

Let me think about how to approach this.

First, let's find the equation of line AB. Since points A and B are given, I can compute the slope and then the equation.

Point A is (1/2, 0) and point B is (0, sqrt(3)/2). The slope of AB is (sqrt(3)/2 - 0)/(0 - 1/2) = (sqrt(3)/2)/(-1/2) = -sqrt(3).

So, the equation of AB is y - 0 = -sqrt(3)(x - 1/2). Simplifying, y = -sqrt(3)x + (sqrt(3)/2).

So, any point C on AB can be parametrized as moving from A to B. Let me use a parameter t, where t=0 corresponds to A and t=1 corresponds to B.

So, the parametric equations for AB would be:

x = (1/2) - (1/2)t

y = 0 + (sqrt(3)/2)t

So, x = (1 - t)/2, y = (sqrt(3)/2)t, where t ranges from 0 to 1.

So, point C can be represented as ((1 - t)/2, (sqrt(3)/2)t) for some t between 0 and 1.

Now, we need to find t such that point C is not on any other segment PQ in F besides AB. That is, for any other PQ in F, C is not on that segment.

Alternatively, C is only on AB and no other PQ from F. So, C is the only point on AB that is not intersected by any other PQ from F except AB.

Wait, but the problem says there's a unique point C on AB (other than A and B) that doesn't belong to any other segment from F. So, perhaps for this point C, if you try to draw any other PQ (from F) that would pass through C, it would have to coincide with AB. Because otherwise, if you can find another PQ from F passing through C, then C would belong to that segment as well, which contradicts the uniqueness.

Hmm, perhaps a better approach is to find the envelope of all these PQ segments. The envelope is the curve that is tangent to each PQ in F. So, the envelope would form a curve, and point C would be the point where AB intersects this envelope. Because, beyond that point, AB would start intersecting other segments PQ, but before that, it doesn't. So, the envelope would touch AB at point C, and beyond that, any other PQ would cross AB.

Wait, I'm not sure. Maybe I need to compute the envelope of the family of segments PQ.

Alternatively, perhaps using the concept of duality. Each segment PQ can be represented as a line in the dual plane, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, since each PQ is a line segment from (p,0) to (0,q) with p² + q² = 1, perhaps I can represent each PQ as the line x/p + y/q = 1, where p² + q² = 1.

Wait, that's a good point. Since PQ is a segment from (p,0) to (0,q), the equation of the line PQ is x/p + y/q = 1.

So, given that p² + q² = 1, each PQ corresponds to a line x/p + y/q = 1 where p² + q² = 1.

So, the family F can be considered as the family of lines x/p + y/q = 1 with p² + q² = 1, p>0, q>0.

Now, the envelope of this family of lines is the curve that is tangent to each of these lines. So, the envelope would be the set of points where each line is tangent to it.

So, to find the envelope, we can use the method of solving for the envelope of a family of curves. The condition for a point (x,y) to lie on the envelope is that it lies on the curve and the derivative with respect to the parameter is zero.

In this case, the parameter can be p (since q can be expressed in terms of p, because p² + q² = 1). So, let's express q in terms of p: q = sqrt(1 - p²).

So, the equation of the line is x/p + y/sqrt(1 - p²) = 1.

Let me denote this equation as F(p, x, y) = x/p + y/sqrt(1 - p²) - 1 = 0.

To find the envelope, we need to solve the system:

F(p, x, y) = 0

dF/dp = 0

So, compute dF/dp.

dF/dp = -x/p² + (y * ( (1/2)(1 - p²)^(-1/2) * (2p) )) / (sqrt(1 - p²))^2 )

Wait, let's compute dF/dp step by step.

F(p, x, y) = x/p + y/(sqrt(1 - p²)) - 1.

So, dF/dp = derivative of x/p is -x/p².

Derivative of y/(sqrt(1 - p²)):

Let me denote f(p) = y/(sqrt(1 - p²)).

df/dp = y * derivative of (1 - p²)^(-1/2)

Which is y * (-1/2)(1 - p²)^(-3/2) * (-2p) = y * p / (1 - p²)^(3/2).

So, overall, dF/dp = -x/p² + y p / (1 - p²)^(3/2) = 0.

So, the two equations are:

1) x/p + y/(sqrt(1 - p²)) = 1

2) -x/p² + y p / (1 - p²)^(3/2) = 0

We can solve these two equations for x and y in terms of p.

Let me denote equation 2:

-y p / (1 - p²)^(3/2) = -x/p²

Wait, equation 2 is:

-x/p² + y p / (1 - p²)^(3/2) = 0 => x/p² = y p / (1 - p²)^(3/2)

So, x = y p^3 / (1 - p²)^(3/2)

Let me write that as x = y * [ p^3 / (1 - p²)^(3/2) ]

Now, let's plug this expression for x into equation 1.

Equation 1: x/p + y/(sqrt(1 - p²)) = 1

Substituting x:

[ y * (p^3 / (1 - p²)^(3/2)) ] / p + y/(sqrt(1 - p²)) = 1

Simplify the first term:

y * (p^3 / (1 - p²)^(3/2)) / p = y * (p^2 / (1 - p²)^(3/2))

So, equation becomes:

y * (p² / (1 - p²)^(3/2)) + y/(sqrt(1 - p²)) = 1

Factor out y:

y [ p² / (1 - p²)^(3/2) + 1/(sqrt(1 - p²)) ] = 1

Let me combine the terms inside the brackets:

Note that 1/(sqrt(1 - p²)) = (1 - p²)^( -1/2 )

Similarly, p² / (1 - p²)^(3/2) = p² (1 - p²)^(-3/2 )

So, the sum is [ p² (1 - p²)^(-3/2) + (1 - p²)^(-1/2) ]

Factor out (1 - p²)^(-3/2):

= (1 - p²)^(-3/2) [ p² + (1 - p²) ]

Because (1 - p²)^(-1/2 ) = (1 - p²)^(-3/2 ) * (1 - p²) )

So, inside the brackets, we have p² + (1 - p²) = 1.

Therefore, the entire expression becomes:

y [ (1 - p²)^(-3/2) * 1 ] = 1

So, y = (1 - p²)^(3/2 )

Now, from earlier, we have x = y * [ p^3 / (1 - p²)^(3/2) ]

Substituting y:

x = (1 - p²)^(3/2) * [ p^3 / (1 - p²)^(3/2) ) ] = p^3

So, we have x = p^3 and y = (1 - p²)^(3/2 )

So, parametric equations for the envelope are:

x = p³

y = (1 - p²)^(3/2 )

So, the envelope is a curve in the first quadrant, parametrized by p in (0,1).

Now, the envelope is the curve that is tangent to each PQ in F. So, at each point on the envelope, it's tangent to one of the PQ segments.

Now, the problem states that point C is on AB and is not on any other PQ from F except AB. So, perhaps point C is the point where AB is tangent to the envelope. Because beyond that point, AB would intersect with other PQ segments.

So, to find point C, we need to find the point where AB is tangent to the envelope curve.

Alternatively, point C lies on both AB and the envelope curve, and it's the only such point (apart from A and B, which are endpoints). So, let's find the intersection of AB and the envelope.

Wait, but AB is a line, and the envelope is a curve. So, the envelope might intersect AB at point C, which is the tangency point.

So, let's substitute the parametric equations of AB into the parametric equations of the envelope.

Wait, the envelope is parametrized as x = p³, y = (1 - p²)^(3/2 ). We can express this in terms of x and y.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to express the envelope in terms of x and y.

From the parametric equations:

x = p³

y = (1 - p²)^(3/2 )

We can try to eliminate p.

From x = p³, so p = x^(1/3)

Then, y = (1 - (x^(1/3))² )^(3/2 ) = (1 - x^(2/3))^(3/2 )

So, the envelope curve is y = (1 - x^(2/3))^(3/2 )

So, the equation of the envelope is y = (1 - x^(2/3))^(3/2 )

Now, the line AB is y = -sqrt(3) x + sqrt(3)/2

We can find their intersection point.

So, set y from AB equal to y from envelope:

-sqrt(3) x + sqrt(3)/2 = (1 - x^(2/3))^(3/2 )

We need to solve for x.

This seems a bit complicated, but perhaps we can find a substitution.

Let me denote t = x^(1/3). Then, x = t³.

So, substituting into the equation:

-sqrt(3) t³ + sqrt(3)/2 = (1 - t²)^(3/2 )

Let me write this as:

sqrt(3)/2 - sqrt(3) t³ = (1 - t²)^(3/2 )

Factor out sqrt(3):

sqrt(3) [ 1/2 - t³ ] = (1 - t²)^(3/2 )

Let me square both sides to eliminate the 3/2 power:

[ sqrt(3) (1/2 - t³) ]² = [ (1 - t²)^(3/2 ) ]²

Which gives:

3 (1/2 - t³)^2 = (1 - t²)^3

Expanding both sides:

Left side: 3*( (1/2)^2 - 2*(1/2)*t³ + t^6 ) = 3*(1/4 - t³ + t^6 ) = 3/4 - 3t³ + 3t^6

Right side: (1 - t²)^3 = 1 - 3t² + 3t^4 - t^6

So, setting them equal:

3/4 - 3t³ + 3t^6 = 1 - 3t² + 3t^4 - t^6

Bring all terms to the left side:

3/4 - 3t³ + 3t^6 - 1 + 3t² - 3t^4 + t^6 = 0

Simplify:

(3/4 - 1) + 3t² - 3t³ - 3t^4 + (3t^6 + t^6) = 0

Compute 3/4 -1 = -1/4

So:

-1/4 + 3t² - 3t³ - 3t^4 + 4t^6 = 0

Multiply both sides by 4 to eliminate the fraction:

-1 + 12 t² - 12 t³ - 12 t^4 + 16 t^6 = 0

Rearranged:

16 t^6 - 12 t^4 - 12 t³ + 12 t² - 1 = 0

Hmm, this is a sixth-degree polynomial in t. Solving this seems quite challenging. Maybe there's a rational root. Let's use the Rational Root Theorem.

Possible rational roots are factors of constant term (±1) over factors of leading coefficient (16). So possible roots are ±1, ±1/2, ±1/4, ±1/8, ±1/16.

Let me test t=1:

16(1)^6 -12(1)^4 -12(1)^3 +12(1)^2 -1 = 16 -12 -12 +12 -1 = 3 ≠ 0.

t= -1:

16(-1)^6 -12(-1)^4 -12(-1)^3 +12(-1)^2 -1 = 16 -12 +12 +12 -1 = 27 ≠0.

t=1/2:

16*(1/2)^6 -12*(1/2)^4 -12*(1/2)^3 +12*(1/2)^2 -1

=16*(1/64) -12*(1/16) -12*(1/8) +12*(1/4) -1

= (16/64) - (12/16) - (12/8) + (12/4) -1

= (1/4) - (3/4) - (3/2) + 3 -1

Convert to quarters:

= (1/4) - (3/4) - (6/4) + (12/4) - (4/4)

= [1 -3 -6 +12 -4]/4 = (0)/4 =0

Oh, t=1/2 is a root.

So, t=1/2 is a solution.

Therefore, we can factor out (t - 1/2) from the polynomial.

Let's perform polynomial division or use synthetic division.

Divide the polynomial 16 t^6 -12 t^4 -12 t³ +12 t² -1 by (t - 1/2). Alternatively, factor (2t -1).

Let me write the polynomial as:

16t^6 +0 t^5 -12t^4 -12t^3 +12t^2 +0 t -1.

Using synthetic division for root t=1/2:

Coefficients: 16, 0, -12, -12, 12, 0, -1

Bring down 16.

Multiply by 1/2: 8.

Add to next term: 0 +8=8.

Multiply by 1/2:4.

Add to next term: -12 +4= -8.

Multiply by 1/2: -4.

Add to next term: -12 + (-4)= -16.

Multiply by 1/2: -8.

Add to next term:12 + (-8)=4.

Multiply by 1/2: 2.

Add to next term:0 +2=2.

Multiply by 1/2:1.

Add to last term: -1 +1=0.

So, the quotient polynomial is:

16 t^5 +8 t^4 -8 t^3 -16 t^2 +4 t +2

So, 16t^6 -12 t^4 -12 t³ +12 t² -1 = (t - 1/2)(16t^5 +8t^4 -8t^3 -16t^2 +4t +2 )

Now, let's see if we can factor this further.

Let me factor out a 2 from the quintic:

2(8t^5 +4t^4 -4t^3 -8t^2 +2t +1 )

So, the quintic is 8t^5 +4t^4 -4t^3 -8t^2 +2t +1.

Let me try to factor this quintic. Let's check for rational roots again.

Possible roots: ±1, ±1/2, ±1/4, ±1/8.

Test t=1:

8 +4 -4 -8 +2 +1= 3 ≠0.

t=-1:

-8 +4 +4 -8 -2 +1= -9 ≠0.

t=1/2:

8*(1/32) +4*(1/16) -4*(1/8) -8*(1/4) +2*(1/2) +1

= (8/32) + (4/16) - (4/8) - (8/4) + (2/2) +1

= (1/4) + (1/4) - (1/2) -2 +1 +1

= 0.25 + 0.25 - 0.5 -2 +1 +1

= (0.5 - 0.5) + (-2 + 2) = 0. So t=1/2 is a root again.

So, t=1/2 is another root.

So, we can factor (t - 1/2) again from the quintic.

Let me perform synthetic division on 8t^5 +4t^4 -4t^3 -8t^2 +2t +1 with t=1/2.

Coefficients:8,4,-4,-8,2,1

Bring down 8.

Multiply by 1/2:4.

Add to next term:4 +4=8.

Multiply by1/2:4.

Add to next term: -4 +4=0.

Multiply by 1/2:0.

Add to next term: -8 +0= -8.

Multiply by 1/2: -4.

Add to next term:2 + (-4)= -2.

Multiply by 1/2: -1.

Add to last term:1 + (-1)=0.

So, the quotient is 8t^4 +8t^3 +0 t^2 -8t -2.

So, the quintic factors as (t -1/2)(8t^4 +8t^3 -8t -2 )

So, the original polynomial is:

(t -1/2)^2 * 2 * (8t^4 +8t^3 -8t -2 )

Let me factor the quartic: 8t^4 +8t^3 -8t -2.

Let me factor out a 2: 2(4t^4 +4t^3 -4t -1 )

So, we have 2*(4t^4 +4t^3 -4t -1 )

Now, let me try to factor 4t^4 +4t^3 -4t -1.

Looking for rational roots again: possible roots are ±1, ±1/2, ±1/4.

Test t=1: 4 +4 -4 -1=3≠0.

t=-1:4 -4 +4 -1=3≠0.

t=1/2:4*(1/16)+4*(1/8)-4*(1/2)-1= (0.25) + 0.5 -2 -1= -2.25≠0.

t=-1/2:4*(1/16)+4*(-1/8)-4*(-1/2)-1=0.25 -0.5 +2 -1=0.75≠0.

t=1/4:4*(1/256)+4*(1/64)-4*(1/4)-1≈ 0.015625 + 0.0625 -1 -1≈ negative.

Not zero.

So, maybe it's factorable into quadratics.

Assume (at² + bt + c)(dt² + et + f) =4t^4 +4t^3 -4t -1.

Multiply out:

a d t^4 + (a e + b d) t^3 + (a f + b e + c d) t^2 + (b f + c e) t + c f

Matching coefficients:

a d =4

a e + b d=4

a f + b e + c d=0

b f + c e= -4

c f= -1

We can try to find integer solutions.

Looking at c f = -1. So, possible (c,f)=(1,-1) or (-1,1).

Let me try c=1, f=-1.

Then, last equation is satisfied.

Now, b f + c e = -4.

So, b*(-1) +1*e = -4 => -b + e = -4.

Next, a f + b e + c d =0.

a*(-1) + b e +1*d =0.

So, -a + b e + d =0.

Also, a e + b d=4.

And a d=4.

Let me assume a=2, d=2 (since 2*2=4).

Then, a=2, d=2.

Now, from a e + b d=4: 2 e + 2 b=4 => e + b=2.

From -b + e = -4: e = b -4.

Substitute into e + b=2:

(b -4) +b=2 => 2b -4=2 =>2b=6 =>b=3.

Then, e=3 -4= -1.

Now, check the other equation: -a + b e + d =0.

-a + b e +d = -2 +3*(-1) +2= -2 -3 +2= -3 ≠0. So, this doesn't work.

Try a=4, d=1.

From a d=4: 4*1=4. Good.

From a e + b d=4:4 e +b*1=4.

From -b + e =-4.

Let me denote:

Equation 1:4e +b=4.

Equation 2: e = b -4.

Substitute into equation 1:4(b -4) +b=4 =>4b -16 +b=4 =>5b=20 =>b=4.

Then, e=4 -4=0.

Now, check the other equation: -a +b e +d= -4 +4*0 +1= -3 ≠0. Not good.

Try another a and d.

a=1, d=4.

Then, a e + b d= e +4b=4.

From -b + e =-4: e =b -4.

Substitute into e +4b=4:

(b -4) +4b=4 =>5b -4=4 =>5b=8 =>b=8/5.

Not integer. Probably not helpful.

Alternatively, a= -2, d= -2. But a and d are positive since leading coefficient is positive.

Wait, perhaps a=4, d=1 again. No, tried that.

Alternatively, maybe a= -4, d= -1? No, since a and d are positive.

Alternatively, maybe a= 1, d=4:

From a e + b d= e +4b=4.

From e =b -4.

So:

(b -4) +4b=4 =>5b=8 =>b=8/5.

Not integer.

Alternatively, perhaps c=-1 and f=1.

Then, c f = (-1)(1)= -1.

So, let's try c=-1, f=1.

Then, the equations:

b f + c e = -4 =>b*1 + (-1)*e =-4 =>b - e = -4 =>e = b +4.

From a f + b e + c d=0: a*1 + b e + (-1) d=0 =>a +b e -d=0.

From a e + b d=4.

And a d=4.

Let me try a=2, d=2.

Then, a=2, d=2.

From a e + b d=4: 2 e +2 b=4 => e +b=2.

From e= b +4.

So, substituting into e +b=2: (b +4) +b=2 =>2b +4=2 =>2b= -2 =>b= -1.

Then, e= (-1) +4=3.

Now, check the other equation a +b e -d=0:

2 + (-1)*3 -2=2 -3 -2= -3 ≠0.

Not good.

Another a and d.

a=4, d=1.

From a e +b d=4:4 e +b=4.

From e= b +4.

Substitute into 4 e +b=4:

4(b +4) +b=4 =>4b +16 +b=4 =>5b= -12 =>b= -12/5. Not integer.

Hmm, this seems tough. Maybe the quartic is not factorable with integer coefficients. Perhaps we need to use another method.

Alternatively, maybe we can use substitution.

Let me consider the quartic:4t^4 +4t^3 -4t -1=0.

Let me let u = t.

So equation is 4u^4 +4u^3 -4u -1=0.

Let me try to factor this as (au^2 + bu +c)(du^2 + eu +f)=4u^4 +4u^3 -4u -1.

I tried before, but maybe with different signs.

Wait, perhaps (2u^2 + mu +n)(2u^2 + pu +q) =4u^4 +4u^3 -4u -1.

Multiply out:

4u^4 + (2p + 2m)u^3 + (mp + 2q + 2n)u^2 + (mq + np)u + nq.

Set equal to 4u^4 +4u^3 +0u^2 -4u -1.

So, matching coefficients:

4u^4: 4=4, okay.

u^3: 2p + 2m=4 => p +m=2.

u^2: m p + 2q + 2n=0.

u term: m q +n p= -4.

Constant term: n q= -1.

So, n q= -1. Possible pairs (n,q)=(1,-1), (-1,1).

Case 1: n=1, q=-1.

Then, from mq +n p= -4: m*(-1) +1*p= -4 => -m +p= -4.

Also, p + m=2.

So, we have:

p + m =2

-p + m=4

Wait, adding the two equations:

(p + m) + (-p + m)=2 +4 =>2m=6 =>m=3.

Then, from p +3=2 =>p= -1.

Now, check the u^2 term: m p +2 q +2n= 3*(-1) +2*(-1)+2*(1)= -3 -2 +2= -3 ≠0. Not good.

Case 2: n=-1, q=1.

Then, from m q +n p= -4: m*(1) + (-1)*p= -4 => m - p= -4.

Also, p + m=2.

So, from m - p= -4 and m + p=2.

We can solve these two equations:

From m + p=2,

From m - p= -4.

Adding both: 2m= -2 =>m= -1.

Then, from m + p=2 => -1 +p=2 =>p=3.

Check the u^2 term: m p +2 q +2n= (-1)*3 +2*(1) +2*(-1)= -3 +2 -2= -3 ≠0.

Again, not zero.

So, perhaps another case.

Alternatively, maybe the quartic has no real roots except t=1/2, which we already found.

Wait, but the original equation was 16t^6 -12 t^4 -12 t³ +12 t² -1=0.

We found t=1/2 is a double root, and the remaining factors are a quartic and a quintic, but perhaps the quartic doesn't contribute any real roots. Let me check the quartic 4t^4 +4t^3 -4t -1.

Let me evaluate it at t=0: 0 +0 -0 -1=-1.

t=1:4+4-4-1=3.

t=0.5:4*(0.0625)+4*(0.125)-4*(0.5)-1=0.25 +0.5 -2 -1= -2.25.

t= -1:4 -4 +4 -1=3.

So, it goes from -1 at t=0, reaches -2.25 at t=0.5, then 3 at t=1. So, there must be a root between t=0.5 and t=1.

Similarly, for negative t, but since in our parametrization t is positive (since p is between 0 and1), perhaps we can ignore negative t.

But in our problem, p is in (0,1), so t=x^(1/3 ) is also in (0,1). So, the quartic may have a root in (0.5,1), but in our parametrization, p ranges from 0 to1.

But perhaps, given that t=1/2 is a double root, and the other roots are either complex or outside our domain, we can consider t=1/2 as the only relevant solution.

So, t=1/2.

So, p= t=1/2.

Wait, but p= t? Wait, earlier substitution was t=x^(1/3 ), but in the parametrization of the envelope, p was a parameter such that x=p³, y=(1-p²)^(3/2).

Wait, perhaps I confused variables earlier. Let me clarify.

Wait, in the parametrization of the envelope, we have:

x = p³,

y = (1 - p²)^(3/2 )

But when I set up the equation for the envelope, I used t as a parameter for the envelope, but in the envelope parametrization, p is the parameter, not t. Hmm, perhaps the confusion arises from using t as a substitution variable.

In any case, since t=1/2 is a solution, which corresponds to p=1/2, perhaps.

Wait, let's get back.

When we set t=x^(1/3 ), so x=t³.

So, in this substitution, t is x^(1/3 ), which is a different variable from the parameter p in the envelope's parametrization.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in substitution. Let me re-express.

The envelope is parametrized by p, x=p^3, y=(1-p^2)^(3/2 )

The line AB is parametrized by t, x=(1-t)/2, y=(sqrt(3)/2 )t.

To find the intersection, set x=p^3 = (1 - t)/2,

and y=(1 -p^2 )^(3/2 )= (sqrt(3)/2 )t.

So, we have two equations:

1. p³ = (1 - t)/2

2. (1 - p²)^(3/2 ) = (sqrt(3)/2 )t

We can try to solve these for p and t.

Let me square both sides of equation 2 to eliminate the square roots.

So, equation 2 squared: (1 - p²)^3 = (3/4 ) t².

From equation 1: t = 1 - 2 p³.

So, substitute t into equation 2 squared:

(1 - p²)^3 = (3/4)(1 - 2 p³ )²

Expand both sides.

Left side: (1 - p²)^3 =1 - 3 p² + 3 p^4 - p^6

Right side: (3/4)(1 -4 p³ +4 p^6 )

So, 3/4 - 3 p³ +3 p^6.

Set them equal:

1 -3 p² +3 p^4 -p^6 = 3/4 -3 p³ +3 p^6

Bring all terms to left side:

1 -3 p² +3 p^4 -p^6 -3/4 +3 p³ -3 p^6=0

Simplify:

(1 - 3/4) + (-3 p²) +3 p^4 +3 p³ -p^6 -3 p^6=0

Calculate 1 - 3/4=1/4.

So,

1/4 -3 p² +3 p^4 +3 p³ -4 p^6=0

Multiply both sides by 4 to eliminate the fraction:

1 -12 p² +12 p^4 +12 p³ -16 p^6=0

Rearranged:

-16 p^6 +12 p^4 +12 p^3 -12 p^2 +1=0

Multiply both sides by -1:

16 p^6 -12 p^4 -12 p^3 +12 p^2 -1=0

Wait, this is the same equation we had before with t as the variable. So, p is the variable here, and the equation is the same as before.

So, we can use the same approach.

We know p=1/2 is a root.

So, let's factor out (p -1/2)^2.

Earlier, we had:

16 p^6 -12 p^4 -12 p³ +12 p² -1= (p -1/2)^2 (something)=0.

So, we can proceed similarly.

But perhaps the only real solution in (0,1) is p=1/2.

So, let's take p=1/2.

Then, from equation 1: p³= (1 - t)/2 => (1/2)^3=1/8= (1 - t)/2 =>1 - t=1/4 =>t=3/4.

So, t=3/4.

So, point C is on AB at t=3/4.

Recall that parametrization of AB is:

x=(1 - t)/2,

y=(sqrt(3)/2 )t.

So, for t=3/4,

x=(1 - 3/4)/2= (1/4)/2=1/8,

y=(sqrt(3)/2)(3/4)= (3 sqrt(3))/8.

So, point C is (1/8, 3 sqrt(3)/8 )

So, OC² is x² + y².

Compute:

x²= (1/8)^2=1/64,

y²= (3 sqrt(3)/8 )²=9*3 /64=27/64.

So, OC²=1/64 +27/64=28/64=7/16.

So, 7/16, which reduces to 7/16, so p=7, q=16, p+q=23.

Wait, but before I conclude, I should check if p=1/2 is the only valid solution.

Because when we squared the equation, we might have introduced extraneous solutions.

But in the context of the problem, point C is unique.

Furthermore, in the envelope, p=1/2 gives x=1/8, y=3 sqrt(3)/8.

So, that must be the point C.

So, OC²= (1/8)^2 + (3 sqrt(3)/8 )^2=1/64 +27/64=28/64=7/16.

So, 7 and 16 are coprime, so p+q=7+16=23.


To solve the problem, we first determine the equation of line segment AB. Points A and B are at \((\frac{1}{2}, 0)\) and \((0, \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2})\), respectively. The slope of AB is calculated as \(-\sqrt{3}\), leading to the equation \(y = -\sqrt{3}x + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\).

Next, we consider the family of segments \(\overline{PQ}\) of unit length, where \(P\) is on the x-axis and \(Q\) is on the y-axis. These segments satisfy \(p^2 + q^2 = 1\) and are represented by the lines \(\frac{x}{p} + \frac{y}{q} = 1\).

To find the envelope of these lines, we solve the system:
\[
\frac{x}{p} + \frac{y}{\sqrt{1 - p^2}} = 1
\]
\[
-\frac{x}{p^2} + \frac{y p}{(1 - p^2)^{3/2}} = 0
\]
This results in the parametric equations for the envelope:
\[
x = p^3, \quad y = (1 - p^2)^{3/2}
\]
Eliminating \(p\), the envelope is expressed as \(y = (1 - x^{2/3})^{3/2}\).

We then find the intersection of this envelope with line AB. Substituting \(y = -\sqrt{3}x + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\) into the envelope equation and solving, we find \(p = \frac{1}{2}\) as a valid solution. This corresponds to point \(C\) on AB at \(t = \frac{3}{4}\).

The coordinates of \(C\) are \(\left(\frac{1}{8}, \frac{3\sqrt{3}}{8}\right)\). Calculating \(OC^2\):
\[
OC^2 = \left(\frac{1}{8}\right)^2 + \left(\frac{3\sqrt{3}}{8}\right)^2 = \frac{1}{64} + \frac{27}{64} = \frac{28}{64} = \frac{7}{16}
\]
Thus, \(OC^2 = \frac{7}{16}\), and \(p + q = 7 + 16 = 23\).

The final answer is \(\boxed{23}\).
