Okay, so I need to solve this math problem about rectangular boxes with a given surface area and volume, and then find the radius of the smallest sphere that can contain any of these boxes. Hmm, let's break this down.

First, the problem says that the set B consists of all rectangular boxes with surface area 54 and volume 23. I'm supposed to find the radius r of the smallest sphere that can contain any of these boxes. Then, express r squared as a fraction p/q, where p and q are coprime, and find p+q.

Alright, so I think the key here is to figure out the dimensions of the box that would require the largest possible sphere to contain it. The sphere's diameter would be equal to the space diagonal of the box, right? Because the sphere has to enclose the entire box, so the diameter must be at least as long as the longest diagonal of the box. Therefore, the radius r would be half of that space diagonal.

So, if I can find the maximum possible space diagonal of any box in set B, then I can find r. The space diagonal d of a rectangular box with side lengths x, y, z is given by d = sqrt(x² + y² + z²). So, r = d/2, which means r² = (x² + y² + z²)/4.

Therefore, to find r², I need to find the maximum value of x² + y² + z² for boxes in B, and then divide by 4.

Now, given that the surface area S is 54 and volume V is 23. For a rectangular box, the surface area is given by 2(xy + yz + xz) = 54, so xy + yz + xz = 27. The volume is xyz = 23.

So, I have the constraints:
1. xy + yz + xz = 27
2. xyz = 23

And I need to maximize x² + y² + z².

I remember that for three variables, there are some inequalities that relate these terms. For example, the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality, or maybe using Lagrange multipliers for optimization under constraints.

Wait, maybe I can use some algebra here. Let me think about how to express x² + y² + z² in terms of the given constraints.

I know that (x + y + z)² = x² + y² + z² + 2(xy + yz + xz). So, if I can find (x + y + z), then I can find x² + y² + z².

But I don't have x + y + z directly. Hmm. Maybe I can find another relation.

Wait, another thought: since we have the volume and the sum of products, perhaps we can treat this as a system of equations and then use optimization techniques.

Alternatively, maybe I can consider using the method of Lagrange multipliers because we're dealing with maximizing a function subject to constraints.

Let me try that approach.

Let f(x, y, z) = x² + y² + z², which is the function we want to maximize.

Subject to the constraints:
1. g(x, y, z) = xy + yz + xz = 27
2. h(x, y, z) = xyz = 23

So, to set up the Lagrangian, we introduce two multipliers, λ and μ, and consider the function:

L = x² + y² + z² - λ(xy + yz + xz - 27) - μ(xyz - 23)

Taking partial derivatives with respect to x, y, z, and setting them to zero to find critical points.

Compute ∂L/∂x:
2x - λ(y + z) - μ(yz) = 0

Similarly, ∂L/∂y:
2y - λ(x + z) - μ(xz) = 0

∂L/∂z:
2z - λ(x + y) - μ(xy) = 0

So, we have the system of equations:

1. 2x = λ(y + z) + μ(yz)
2. 2y = λ(x + z) + μ(xz)
3. 2z = λ(x + y) + μ(xy)

And the constraints:

4. xy + yz + xz = 27
5. xyz = 23

Hmm, this seems a bit complicated, but maybe I can find some symmetry or make some substitutions.

Looking at equations 1, 2, and 3, perhaps the variables x, y, z are symmetric in these equations. So, maybe the maximum occurs when x = y = z? But wait, wait—if x = y = z, then the surface area would be 6x² = 54, so x² = 9, x=3, and volume would be 27. But the volume here is 23, which is less than 27. So, the box can't be a cube because the volume is less than that of a cube with the same surface area. Therefore, the maximum x² + y² + z² might not occur at a cube.

So, perhaps the maximum occurs when two variables are equal, and the third is different. Let's assume x = y, and find z.

Let me set x = y.

Then, from the volume constraint: x * x * z = x² z = 23 → z = 23/(x²)

From the surface area constraint: xy + yz + xz = x² + 2xz = 27.

Substituting z:

x² + 2x*(23/x²) = 27 → x² + 46/x = 27.

Multiply both sides by x:

x³ + 46 = 27x → x³ -27x +46 =0.

Hmm, we need to solve this cubic equation: x³ -27x +46=0.

Let me try to find rational roots using Rational Root Theorem. Possible roots are ±1, ±2, ±23, ±46.

Testing x=1: 1 -27 +46=20≠0

x=2: 8 -54 +46=0. Oh, x=2 is a root.

So, we can factor it as (x-2)(x² +2x -23)=0.

So, the other roots are solutions to x² +2x -23=0.

Using quadratic formula: x = [-2 ± sqrt(4 +92)]/2 = [-2 ± sqrt(96)]/2 = [-2 ± 4*sqrt(6)]/2 = -1 ± 2*sqrt(6).

So, x=2, or x= -1 +2√6 ≈ -1 +4.898≈3.898, or x=-1-2√6≈-5.898.

Since lengths can't be negative, x=2 and x≈3.898.

So, when x=2, then z=23/(2²)=23/4=5.75.

So, in this case, the box has dimensions x=y=2, z=5.75.

Then, x² + y² + z² = 2*(2²) + (5.75)^2 = 8 + 33.0625 =41.0625.

Wait, that's 41.0625, which is 41 and 1/16, or 657/16.

Alternatively, when x= -1 +2√6, which is approximately 3.898, then z=23/(x²). Let me compute x²:

x= -1 +2√6 → x²= (1 -4√6 + (2√6)^2)=1 -4√6 +24=25 -4√6.

So, z=23/(25 -4√6). Maybe rationalize the denominator:

Multiply numerator and denominator by (25 +4√6):

z=23*(25 +4√6)/[(25)^2 - (4√6)^2] = 23*(25 +4√6)/(625 - 16*6)=23*(25 +4√6)/(625-96)=23*(25 +4√6)/529.

Simplify 23/529=1/23.

So, z=(25 +4√6)/23.

So, z≈(25 +9.798)/23≈34.798/23≈1.513.

So, the dimensions would be x≈3.898, y≈3.898, z≈1.513.

Then, x² + y² + z²≈2*(25 -4√6) + (25 +4√6)/23².

Wait, maybe I should compute it more precisely.

Wait, no, perhaps I can compute x² + y² + z² in terms of x.

Since x = y, and z=23/x².

So, x² + x² + z² =2x² + z².

But z=23/x², so z²= (23)^2 /x^4.

So, 2x² + (529)/x^4.

Hmm, that seems complicated. Alternatively, maybe I can write x² + y² + z²= 2x² + (23/(x²))².

Wait, but that becomes 2x² + (529)/(x^4). Hmm, not sure if that helps.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use calculus to find the maximum or the minimum.

Wait, but maybe the maximum occurs at x=2, z=23/4, as that's one critical point, but I'm not sure if that's a maximum or a minimum.

Wait, maybe if I compute x² + y² + z² for both cases.

Case 1: x=2, z=23/4=5.75.

So, x² + y² + z²=2*(4) + (5.75)^2=8
