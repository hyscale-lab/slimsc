Okay, so I've got this problem here about coloring the vertices of a regular octagon either red or blue. Each vertex is colored independently with equal probability, so that's a 50-50 chance for each color. The question is about the probability that after coloring, we can rotate the octagon such that all the blue vertices end up where there were originally red vertices. They mention that the probability is m/n, where m and n are coprime, and we need to find m + n.

Hmm, let me try to break this down. First, a regular octagon has eight vertices, each of which can be colored red or blue. Since each color is equally likely, the total number of possible colorings is 2^8, which is 256. So that's our denominator for the probability.

Now, the numerator is the number of colorings where there exists a rotation that maps all blue vertices to positions that were originally red. Wait, actually, the problem says "so that all of the blue vertices end up at positions where there were originally red vertices." So I think that means that after rotation, every blue vertex is now on a spot that was red before the rotation. So in other words, the set of blue vertices is a rotation of the set of red vertices.

Wait, maybe another way to think about it: The blue vertices must be a rotation of the red vertices. Because if you can rotate the octagon so that all blue vertices align with red positions, that implies that the blue set is a rotated version of the red set. Since the octagon is regular, rotations correspond to shifting the vertices by some number of steps.

But wait, the problem doesn't specify which rotation, just that some rotation exists. So for a given coloring, it's acceptable if there exists a rotation (by, say, k positions) such that every blue vertex, when rotated by k, lands on a red vertex.

Wait, but actually, let me clarify that. If the octagon is rotated, then each vertex moves to a new position. So if originally, the octagon had some red and blue vertices, after rotation, each blue vertex would move to a new position. The condition is that after some rotation, all the blue vertices end up on positions where the original color was red. So in other words, for each blue vertex in the original coloring, after rotation, it's on a spot that was red.

But that's equivalent to saying that the set of blue
