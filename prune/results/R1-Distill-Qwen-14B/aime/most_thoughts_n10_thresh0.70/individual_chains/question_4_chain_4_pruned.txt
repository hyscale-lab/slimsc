Okay, so I've got this problem where Alice and Bob are playing a game with a stack of n tokens. They take turns removing either 1 or 4 tokens each turn, and the person who takes the last token wins. I need to figure out how many positive integers n â‰¤ 2024 allow Bob to have a winning strategy, no matter how Alice plays.

Hmm. Let's think about how these kinds of games work. It's similar to the classic Nim game, but with specific move options. So, the key here is to determine for which n Bob can force a win, regardless of Alice's moves. That usually involves finding some pattern or mathematical structure in the winning and losing positions.

In such games, a position is called a losing position if the player whose turn it is cannot force a win, assuming the opponent plays optimally. Conversely, a winning position is one where the current player can force a win.

So, let's try to model this. Let's define a function W(n) where W(n) = True if the current player can force a win with n tokens, and False otherwise.

Now, the base case would be when n=0. If there are no tokens left, the game is over, and the player who just moved has won. So, if it's your turn and n=0, you lose. So W(0) = False.

For n=1: the current player can take 1 token and win. So W(1) = True.

n=2: the current player can take 1 token, leaving 1 token for the opponent, who can then take it and win. So if the current player takes 1, opponent wins. Alternatively, can the current player take 4 tokens? No, because n=2 <4. So the only move is to take 1, leaving 1 for the opponent, who then wins. So W(2) = False? Wait, wait. Wait, if n=2, the current player takes 1, leaving 1. Then the opponent can take that 1 and win. So yes, the current player (for n=2) can't win, so W(2) = False.

Wait, maybe I should think in terms of Grundy numbers or something. Alternatively, maybe just list the positions step by step.

Let me list n from 0 upwards and mark whether it's a winning (W) or losing (L) position.

n : 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 ...
W/L: L W L ? ? ? ? ? ? ?  ?  ?  ?  ?  ?  ? 

Wait, let's build this step by step.

n=0: L (no move possible, you lose)
n=1: W (take 1, win)
n=2: from 2, you can take 1, leaving n=1, which is W for the opponent. So if you take 1, opponent can win. So for n=2, all possible moves lead to opponent's win. So n=2 is L.
n=3: You can take 1, leaving n=2 (L for opponent). So if you take 1, opponent is in a losing position. So n=3 is W.
n=4: You can take 4, which would end the game, so you win. Hence, W.
n=5: You can take 1, leaving n=4 (W for opponent). Or take 4, leaving n=1 (W for opponent). So both options leave opponent in W. So n=5 is L.
Wait, is that right? Wait, if you take 1 from 5, you leave 4, which is a W position for opponent. Opponent can take 4 and win. Alternatively, if you take 4 from 5, you leave 1, which opponent can take and win. So yes, any move you make from 5 leaves opponent in a W position, so n=5 is L.

n=6: Your options are to take 1 or 4. Let's see:

If you take 1, leaving n=5 (which is L for opponent). So opponent
