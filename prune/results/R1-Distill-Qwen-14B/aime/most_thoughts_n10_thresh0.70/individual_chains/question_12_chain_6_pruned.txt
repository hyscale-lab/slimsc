Okay, so I've got this math problem here about a 2x3 grid where I need to place digits. The goal is to have the sum of the two numbers formed by reading left to right equal 999, and the sum of the three numbers formed by reading top to bottom equal 99. Hmm, let me try to visualize this grid.

So, the grid has 2 rows and 3 columns. Let's label the cells like this:

a b c
d e f

When read left to right, the top row is the number abc, and the bottom row is def. So, the first condition is that abc + def = 999.

When read top to bottom, we get ad, be, and cf. So, the second condition is ad + be + cf = 99.

I need to find how many ways I can fill the grid with digits (0-9) such that both conditions are satisfied.

Wait a minute, the example given is:

0 0 8
9 9 1

So, reading left to right, top row is 008 which is 8, and bottom row is 991. 8 + 991 = 999, which works. Reading top to bottom, we get 09, 09, and 81. Wait, no, actually, each column is a single digit from top to bottom, so it's ad, be, cf. So, the first column is 0 and 9, which is 09 (which is 9). Second column is 0 and 9, which is 09 (9). Third column is 8 and 1, which is 81. So, 9 + 9 + 81 = 99, which works. Got it.

So, each column is a two-digit number, right? So, for each column, the top digit is the first digit, the bottom is the second. And the sum of these three two-digit numbers is 99.

Wait, but 09 is 9, so leading zeros are allowed since it's a grid, not actual numbers. So, 09 is a valid two-digit number, it's just 9. So, that's fine.

So
