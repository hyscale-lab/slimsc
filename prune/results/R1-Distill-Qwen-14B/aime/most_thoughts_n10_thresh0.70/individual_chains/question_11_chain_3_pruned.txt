Okay, so I've got this math problem here: I need to find the largest possible real part of the expression (75 + 117i)z + (96 + 144i)/z, where z is a complex number with |z| = 4. Hmm, alright, let's break this down step by step.

First, I remember that any complex number z can be expressed in polar form. Since the magnitude of z is 4, I can write z as 4e^{iθ}, where θ is the argument of z. That might make things easier because working with exponentials can sometimes simplify multiplication and division.

So let's substitute z = 4e^{iθ} into the expression. Then, 1/z would be (1/4)e^{-iθ} because the reciprocal of e^{iθ} is e^{-iθ}, and the magnitude becomes 1/4.

Now, the expression becomes:

(75 + 117i) * 4e^{iθ} + (96 + 144i) * (1/4)e^{-iθ}

Let me compute each term separately.

First term: (75 + 117i) * 4e^{iθ} = 4*(75 + 117i)*e^{iθ}

Second term: (96 + 144i) * (1/4)e^{-iθ} = (1/4)*(96 + 144i)*e^{-iθ}

Hmm, okay. Let me compute the coefficients first.

For the first term, 4*(75 + 117i) = 300 + 468i.

For the second term, (1/4)*(96 + 144i) = 24 + 36i.

So now the expression simplifies to:

(300 + 468i)e^{iθ} + (24 + 36i)e^{-iθ}

Hmm, I need to find the real part of this entire expression. So, let me think about how to compute the real part when we have exponentials.

I know that e^{iθ} = cosθ + i sinθ, and e^{-iθ} = cosθ - i sinθ. So if I can express each term in terms of cosθ and sinθ, I can then combine the real parts.

Let's take the first term: (300 + 468i)(cosθ + i sinθ)

Multiply this out:

300*cosθ + 300i sinθ + 468i cosθ + 468i^2 sinθ

Similarly, the second term: (24 + 36i)(cosθ - i sinθ)

Multiply this out:

24 cosθ - 24i sinθ + 36i cosθ - 36i^2 sinθ

Wait, but i^2 is -1, so let's substitute that.

First term after expansion:

300 cosθ + 300i sinθ + 468i cosθ - 468 sinθ

Second term after expansion:

24 cosθ - 24i sinθ + 36i cosθ + 36 sinθ

Now, let's group the real and imaginary parts.

For the first term:

Real part: 300 cosθ - 468 sinθ

Imaginary part: (300 sinθ + 468 cosθ) i

For the second term:

Real part: 24 cosθ + 36 sinθ

Imaginary part: (-24 sinθ + 36 cosθ) i

So combining both terms, the entire expression's real part is:

(300 cosθ - 468 sinθ) + (24 cosθ + 36 sinθ) = (300 + 24) cosθ + (-468 + 36) sinθ

Which is 324 cosθ - 432 sinθ.

Similarly, the imaginary parts would combine, but since we're only interested in the real part, we can ignore the imaginary components for now.

So, the real part is 324 cosθ - 432 sinθ.

Now, our goal is to find the maximum value of this expression as θ varies. Since this is a function of θ, we can treat it as a function f(θ) = 324 cosθ - 432 sinθ.

To find the maximum of f(θ), I recall that expressions of the form A cosθ + B sinθ can be rewritten as C cos(θ + φ), where C is the amplitude and φ is the phase shift. The maximum value of such an expression is the amplitude C.

Alternatively, since f(θ) is a linear combination of sine and cosine, the maximum will be the square root of (A^2 + B^2). Wait, yeah, because:

A cosθ + B sinθ = sqrt(A^2 + B^2) * cos(θ - φ), where φ is such that cosφ = A / sqrt(A^2 + B^2) and sinφ = B / sqrt(A^2 + B^2). So the maximum value is sqrt(A^2 + B^2).

In our case, A is 324, and B is -432.

So, the maximum of f(θ) is sqrt(324^2 + (-432)^2).

Let me compute that.

First, compute 324 squared:

324^2 = (300 + 24)^2 = 300^2 + 2*300*24 + 24^2 = 90000 + 14400 + 576 = 90000 + 14400 is 104400, plus 576 is 104,976.

Then, compute 432^2. Since 432 is 432, 432^2 = 186,624. Hmm, because 400^2 is 160,000, 32^2 is 1,024, and cross term is 2*400*32=25,600. So 160,000 + 25,600 = 185,600 + 1,024 = 186,624.

So 324^2 + 432^2 = 104,976 + 186,624 = 291,600.

So the square root of 291,600 is sqrt(291600). Let me see, 540^2 is 291,600 because 500^2 is 250,000, 40^2 is 1,600, and 2*500*40=40,000. So 250,000 + 40,000 + 1,600 = 291,600. So sqrt(291,600)=540.

Wait, so the maximum real part is 540? That seems straightforward, but let me double-check.

Alternatively, perhaps I can think of f(θ) as the dot product of the vector (324, -432) with the
