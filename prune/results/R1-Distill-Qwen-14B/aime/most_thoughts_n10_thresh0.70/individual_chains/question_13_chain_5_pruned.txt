Okay, so I have this math problem here about Aya's morning walk and coffee shop stop. Let me try to figure this out step by step. 

First, the problem says Aya walks 9 kilometers every morning. She walks at a constant speed, s kilometers per hour, and this takes her 4 hours, including t minutes spent in the coffee shop. Then, when she walks faster, at s + 2 km/h, the walk takes 2 hours and 24 minutes, including the same t minutes in the coffee shop. Now, we're supposed to find out how long her walk takes when she walks at s + 1/2 km/h, again including t minutes.

Hmm. So, the key here is that the time spent in the coffee shop is the same in both scenarios, t minutes. So, the difference in total time between walking at s km/h and s+2 km/h is the difference in walking time, without counting the coffee shop time.

Let me break this down. The total time she spends each morning includes both the walking time and the coffee time. So, when she walks at speed s, the total time is 4 hours, which includes t minutes. When she walks at s+2, the total time is 2 hours and 24 minutes, which is 2.4 hours if I convert 24 minutes to a decimal. Wait, no, 24 minutes is 24/60 hours, which is 0.4 hours. So total time is 2.4 hours.

Wait, let me make sure. 24 minutes is 24/60 = 0.4 hours. So 2 hours 24 minutes is 2 + 0.4 = 2.4 hours. And 4 hours is straightforward. So, the difference in total time is 4 - 2.4 = 1.6 hours. But that includes the coffee shop time, right? So, the actual difference in walking time is 1.6 hours minus the difference in coffee shop time. But wait, the coffee shop time is the same in both cases, so the difference in total time is entirely due to the difference in walking time.

Wait, no. Because the total time includes the coffee shop time. So, if she spends t minutes in the coffee shop each time, then the walking time plus t is the total time. So, let me denote:

Total time at
