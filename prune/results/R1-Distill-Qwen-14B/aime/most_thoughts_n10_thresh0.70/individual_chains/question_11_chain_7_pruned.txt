Okay, so I have this problem here: I need to find the largest possible real part of the expression (75 + 117i)z + (96 + 144i)/z, where z is a complex number with |z| = 4. Hmm, that looks a bit intimidating at first glance, but I think I can break it down.

First, let's understand what's being asked. I'm supposed to maximize the real part of this complex expression. Since z is a complex number with a fixed modulus of 4, that means z lies on a circle in the complex plane with radius 4. So, z can be represented as 4e^{iθ}, where θ is the argument of z. That might be a good starting point.

Let me write z as 4e^{iθ}. Since the modulus of z is 4, 1/z would be (1/4)e^{-iθ}. So, substituting z and 1/z into the expression, let's see:

Expression = (75 + 117i) * 4e^{iθ} + (96 + 144i) * (1/4)e^{-iθ}.

Let me compute each part separately. First, expand (75 + 117i) * 4e^{iθ}.

Multiplying 4 into (75 + 117i) gives 300 + 468i. So, the first term is (300 + 468i)e^{iθ}. Similarly, the second term is (96 + 144i)*(1/4). Let's compute that: 96/4 = 24, 144/4 = 36, so it's 24 + 36i. So, the second term is (24 + 36i)e^{-iθ}.

So now, the expression becomes (300 + 468i)e^{iθ} + (24 + 36i)e^{-iθ}.

Hmm, okay. I think I can use Euler's formula here. Remember that e^{iθ} = cosθ + i sinθ, and similarly e^{-iθ} = cosθ - i sinθ.

Let me distribute the multiplication:

First term: (300 + 468i)(cosθ + i sinθ) = 300cosθ + 300i sinθ + 468i cosθ + 468i^2 sinθ. Since i^2 = -1, that becomes 300cosθ + (300 sinθ + 468 cosθ)i - 468 sinθ.

Similarly, second term: (24 + 36i)(cosθ - i sinθ) = 24cosθ -24i sinθ +36i cosθ -36i^2 sinθ. Again, i^2 = -1, so this becomes 24cosθ + ( -24 sinθ +36 cosθ)i +36 sinθ.

Now, let's combine these two terms. Let's separate the real and imaginary parts.

Real parts from first term: 300cosθ - 468 sinθ.

Imaginary parts from first term: (300 sinθ + 468 cosθ)i.

Real parts from second term: 24cosθ +36 sinθ.

Imaginary parts from second term: (-24 sinθ +36 cosθ)i.

Adding the real parts together: (300cosθ - 468 sinθ +24cosθ +36 sinθ) = (324cosθ -432 sinθ).

Adding the imaginary parts: [300 sinθ + 468 cosθ -24 sinθ +36 cosθ]i = [276 sinθ +504 cosθ]i.

So, the entire expression simplifies to:

(324cosθ -432 sinθ) + (276 sinθ +504 cosθ)i.

But we're interested in the real part of this expression. So, the real part is 324cosθ -432 sinθ.

So, now the problem reduces to finding the maximum value of 324cosθ -432 sinθ, where θ is a real number. That's a standard trigonometric function optimization problem.

I remember that expressions like A cosθ + B sinθ can be rewritten as C cos(θ + φ), where C is the amplitude and φ is the phase shift. The maximum value of such an expression is C, and the minimum is -C.

So, let's compute C for our expression. The given real part is 324 cosθ -432 sinθ. Let me write this as A cosθ + B sinθ, where A = 324 and B = -432.

The amplitude C is sqrt(A² + B²). Let's compute that.

C = sqrt(324² + (-432)^2) = sqrt( (324)^2 + (432)^2 ). Let's compute 324 squared and 432 squared.

324 squared: 324 * 324. Let's compute that:

300^2 = 90,000.

24^2 = 576.

Cross term: 2*300*24=14,400.

So, 324^2 = (300 +24)^2= 300^2 + 2*300*24 +24^2 = 90,000 +14,400 +576 = 105, 90,000 +14,400 is 104,400, plus 576 is 104,976.

Similarly, 432^2: Let's compute that.

400^2 =160,000.

32^2 = 1,024.

Cross term: 2*400*32=25,600.

So, 432^2 = (400+32)^2 =400² + 2*400*32 +32² =160,000 +25,600 +1,024= 186,624.

So, C = sqrt(104,976 + 186,624). Let's add those numbers:

104,976 + 186,624. 100,000 +186,624 is 286,624, plus 4,976 is 291,600.

So, C = sqrt(291,600). Hmm, sqrt(291600). Let me see, 291600 = 2916 * 100, so sqrt(2916)*10. Now, sqrt(2916). Let me compute that:

54^2 = 2916 because 50^2=2500, 55^2=3025. 54^2 = (50+4)^2=2500 +400 +16=2916. Yes, so sqrt(2916)=54. So, sqrt(291600)=54*10=540.

So, the amplitude C is 540. That means the maximum value of the real part is 540.

Wait, that seems straightforward, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the calculations. Let me recap.

We had:

Real part = 324 cosθ -432 sinθ.

Expressed as A cosθ + B sinθ, with A = 324, B = -432.

Compute C = sqrt(A² + B²) = sqrt(324² + (-432)^2).

324² is 104,976; 432² is 186,624.

Sum is 291,600. sqrt(291,600) is 540. So, yes, the maximum real part is 540.

Wait a second, but let me think again. Because sometimes, when dealing with complex expressions, especially when you have both z and 1/z terms, you might have to consider if there's any constraint beyond just the modulus. But in this case, since we expressed z as 4e^{iθ}, 1/z is naturally (1/4)e^{-iθ}, so I think it's handled correctly.

Another point to check: Did I correctly compute the real parts when expanding both terms?

Let me go back.

First term expansion:

(300 + 468i)(cosθ + i sinθ) = 300 cosθ + 300 i sinθ + 468 i cosθ + 468 i² sinθ.

Which is 300 cosθ + 300i sinθ +468i cosθ -468 sinθ.

So, grouping real and imaginary parts:

Real: 300 cosθ -468 sinθ.

Imaginary: (300 sinθ +468 cosθ) i.

Second term expansion:

(24 +36i)(cosθ -i sinθ) = 24 cosθ -24i sinθ +36i cosθ -36i² sinθ.

Which is 24 cosθ -24i sinθ +36i cosθ +36 sinθ.

Grouping real and imaginary parts:

Real:24 cosθ +36 sinθ.

Imaginary: (-24 sinθ +36 cosθ) i.

Adding both real parts: (300cosθ -468 sinθ) + (24cosθ +36 sinθ) = 324 cosθ -432 sinθ.

Yes, that's correct. And adding the imaginary parts, but since we're only looking for the real part, that's okay.

So, the real part is 324 cosθ - 432 sinθ, which has a maximum of 540. Therefore, the largest possible real part is 540.

I think that's the answer. Let me just make sure I didn't miss anything in the problem statement. The expression is (75+117i)z + (96+144i)/z. I correctly substituted z as 4e^{iθ} and 1/z as (1/4)e^{-iθ}. Calculated each term, expanded, combined, and found the real part. Then, used the amplitude method for the trigonometric function to find the maximum.

Wait, just to double-check, let's compute 324 and 432. 324 is 75*4 + 117*0? Wait, no. Wait, 75*4=300, 117*4=468, which is correct. Then 96/4=24 and 144/4=36. So, yes, the substitutions
