Okay, so I've got this math problem here, and I need to figure out how many residents in Aimeville own all four items: a diamond ring, a set of golf clubs, a garden spade, and a bag of candy hearts. Hmm, sounds like a combinatorics problem, probably involving sets and maybe some inclusion-exclusion principle. Let me try to break it down.

First, let me list out all the given information:

- Total residents: 900
- Number owning a diamond ring (let's call this D): 195
- Number owning golf clubs (G): 367
- Number owning a garden spade (S): 562
- Everyone owns a bag of candy hearts (H). So, H = 900. Wait, that's interesting because it's the same as the total number of residents, meaning every resident has at least one candy heart.

The problem also states that 437 residents own exactly two of these things, and 234 own exactly three of them. We need to find how many own all four.

I think the best way to approach this is by using the principle of inclusion-exclusion for four sets. But I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact formula, so let me recall.

The inclusion-exclusion principle for four sets states that:

|D ∪ G ∪ S ∪ H| = |D| + |G| + |S| + |H| - |D∩G| - |D∩S| - |D∩H| - |G∩S| - |G∩H| - |S∩H| + |D∩G∩S| + |D∩G∩H| + |D∩S∩H| + |G∩S∩H| - |D∩G∩S∩H|

But wait, since everyone owns a candy heart, H is 900. So, H is a universal set here because all residents have it. That might simplify things because any intersection involving H will just be the other set.

Wait, that's not entirely accurate. If H is the universal set, then the intersection of any other set with H is just that other set. For example, D∩H is just D, because everyone who owns a diamond ring also owns a candy heart. Similarly, G∩H is G, and S∩H is S.
