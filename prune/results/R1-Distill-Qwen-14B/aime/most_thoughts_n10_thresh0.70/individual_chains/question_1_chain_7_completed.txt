Okay, so I've got this problem with three variables x, y, z, all positive real numbers. They're satisfying a system of logarithmic equations, and I need to find the absolute value of log base 2 of (x^4 y^3 z^2), which will be a fraction m/n. Then I have to find m + n.

Let me write down the given equations:

1. log₂(x/(y z)) = 1/2
2. log₂(y/(x z)) = 1/3
3. log₂(z/(x y)) = 1/4

Hmm, logarithms can be tricky, but I remember that log_b(a) = c is equivalent to b^c = a. So maybe I can rewrite each equation in exponential form to make it easier to handle.

Starting with the first equation: log₂(x/(y z)) = 1/2. Converting this, 2^(1/2) = x/(y z). 2^(1/2) is the square root of 2, so sqrt(2) = x/(y z). Let me write that as equation (1a):

(1a) x = y z * sqrt(2)

Similarly, the second equation: log₂(y/(x z)) = 1/3. So 2^(1/3) = y/(x z). Let me write that as equation (2a):

(2a) y = x z * 2^(1/3)

Third equation: log₂(z/(x y)) = 1/4. So 2^(1/4) = z/(x y). Equation (3a):

(3a) z = x y * 2^(1/4)

Okay, so now I have three equations with x, y, z in terms of the others. Maybe I can substitute these into each other to find expressions for x, y, z.

Let me see. From (1a), x is expressed in terms of y and z. From (2a), y is in terms of x and z. From (3a), z is in terms of x and y. So perhaps I can substitute each into the other.

Let me try substituting equation (2a) into equation (1a). So equation (1a) says x = y z * sqrt(2). But y = x z * 2^(1/3), so substituting that into (1a):

x = (x z * 2^(1/3)) * z * sqrt(2)

Simplify that:

x = x z^2 * 2^(1/3) * sqrt(2)

Hmm, let's compute 2^(1/3) * sqrt(2). Since sqrt(2) is 2^(1/2), so 2^(1/3) * 2^(1/2) = 2^(1/3 + 1/2) = 2^( (2 + 3)/6 ) = 2^(5/6). So:

x = x z^2 * 2^(5/6)

Divide both sides by x (assuming x ≠ 0, which it isn't since it's positive):

1 = z^2 * 2^(5/6)

Then, solving for z^2:

z^2 = 1 / (2^(5/6)) = 2^(-5/6)

Take square root:

z = 2^(-5/12), since sqrt(2^(-5/6)) = 2^(-5/12). Since z is positive, we take the positive root.

So z = 2^(-5/12). Let me note this as equation (z).

Now, from equation (3a): z = x y * 2^(1/4). We can plug z into this equation and solve for x y.

So, 2^(-5/12) = x y * 2^(1/4)

Solve for x y:

x y = 2^(-5/12) / 2^(1/4) = 2^(-5/12 - 3/12) = 2^(-8/12) = 2^(-2/3)

So x y = 2^(-2/3). Let me write that as equation (xy).

Now, from equation (2a): y = x z * 2^(1/3). We know z is 2^(-5/12), so:

y = x * 2^(-5/12) * 2^(1/3)

Simplify exponents: 2^(-5/12 + 4/12) because 1/3 is 4/12. So:

y = x * 2^(-1/12)

So y = x * 2^(-1/12). Let's call this equation (y).

Now, from equation (xy): x y = 2^(-2/3). But y = x * 2^(-1/12), so substituting:

x * (x * 2^(-1/12)) = 2^(-2/3)

Which is x^2 * 2^(-1/12) = 2^(-2/3)

Solve for x^2:

x^2 = 2^(-2/3) / 2^(-1/12) = 2^(-2/3 + 1/12) = 2^(-8/12 + 1/12) = 2^(-7/12)

So x^2 = 2^(-7/12). Taking square roots:

x = 2^(-7/24), since sqrt(2^(-7/12)) = 2^(-7/24). Again, positive root.

So x is 2^(-7/24). Equation (x).

Now, from equation (y): y = x * 2^(-1/12). So plugging in x:

y = 2^(-7/24) * 2^(-1/12) = 2^(-7/24 - 2/24) = 2^(-9/24) = 2^(-3/8)

So y is 2^(-3/8). Equation (y).

Let me recap the values I have:

x = 2^(-7/24)
y = 2^(-3/8)
z = 2^(-5/12)

Let me check if these satisfy the original equations.

Wait, maybe I should express all exponents with a common denominator to make it easier.

Denominator can be 24.

x = 2^(-7/24)
y = 2^(-9/24) [since -3/8 is -9/24]
z = 2^(-10/24) [since -5/12 is -10/24]

So exponents:

x: -7/24
y: -9/24
z: -10/24

So now, let me check equation (1a): x = y z sqrt(2)

Compute y z: 2^(-9/24) * 2^(-10/24) = 2^(-19/24)

Multiply by sqrt(2) = 2^(1/2) = 2^(12/24)

So y z sqrt(2) = 2^(-19/24 + 12/24) = 2^(-7/24) which is equal to x. So equation (1a) holds.

Good, that's correct.

Similarly, equation (2a): y = x z * 2^(1/3)

Compute x z: 2^(-7/24) * 2^(-10/24) = 2^(-17/24)

Multiply by 2^(1/3) = 2^8/24 (since 1/3 = 8/24)

So x z * 2^(1/3) = 2^(-17/24 + 8/24) = 2^(-9/24) = y. So equation (2a) is okay.

Equation (3a): z = x y * 2^(1/4)

Compute x y: 2^(-7/24) * 2^(-9/24) = 2^(-16/24) = 2^(-2/3)

Multiply by 2^(1/4) = 2^6/24.

So x y * 2^(1/4) = 2^(-16/24 + 6/24) = 2^(-10/24) = z. So equation (3a) holds.

Great, so the values are consistent.

Now, the problem asks for |log₂(x^4 y^3 z^2)|.

Let me compute the exponent first: 4 log₂x + 3 log₂y + 2 log₂z.

Because log₂(x^4 y^3 z^2) = 4 log₂x + 3 log₂y + 2 log₂z.

So, let's compute each term:

log₂x = log₂(2^(-7/24)) = -7/24
log₂y = log₂(2^(-9/24)) = -9/24 = -3/8
log₂z = log₂(2^(-10/24)) = -10/24 = -5/12

So,

4 log₂x = 4*(-7/24) = -28/24 = -7/6
3 log₂y = 3*(-9/24) = -27/24 = -9/8
2 log₂z = 2*(-10/24) = -20/24 = -5/6

Adding them together:

-7/6 -9/8 -5/6

Let me find a common denominator, which is 24.

Convert each fraction:

-7/6 = -28/24
-9/8 = -27/24
-5/6 = -20/24

So total sum: (-28 -27 -20)/24 = (-75)/24

Simplify: -75/24 = -25/8.

So log₂(x^4 y^3 z^2) = -25/8.

The absolute value is | -25/8 | = 25/8.

So the value is 25/8. Since 25 and 8 are coprime, m=25, n=8, so m + n = 33.

Wait, is that right? Let me double-check my calculations.

Wait, in computing 4 log₂x: 4 * (-7/24) = -28/24 = -7/6. Correct.

3 log₂y: 3 * (-9/24) = -27/24 = -9/8. Correct.

2 log₂z: 2 * (-10/24) = -20/24 = -5/6. Correct.

Adding them: -7/6 -9/8 -5/6.

Combine the terms:

First, combine -7/6 and -5/6: (-7 -5)/6 = -12/6 = -2. So -2 -9/8.

Convert -2 to eighths: -16/8 -9/8 = (-25)/8. Oh wait, that's different from before.

Wait, earlier I converted all to 24 denominator and got -75/24 = -25/8. That's the same as this.

So yes, log₂(x^4 y^3 z^2) is -25/8, absolute value is 25/8.

So m=25, n=8. They are coprime, since 25 is 5^2, 8 is 2^3. No common factors.

So m + n = 25 + 8 = 33.

So the final answer is 33.


To solve the system of equations involving logarithms, we start by converting each logarithmic equation to its exponential form:

1. \(\log_2\left(\frac{x}{yz}\right) = \frac{1}{2} \implies \frac{x}{yz} = 2^{1/2} = \sqrt{2}\)
2. \(\log_2\left(\frac{y}{xz}\right) = \frac{1}{3} \implies \frac{y}{xz} = 2^{1/3}\)
3. \(\log_2\left(\frac{z}{xy}\right) = \frac{1}{4} \implies \frac{z}{xy} = 2^{1/4}\)

From these, we express \(x\), \(y\), and \(z\) in terms of each other:

1. \(x = yz \cdot \sqrt{2}\)
2. \(y = xz \cdot 2^{1/3}\)
3. \(z = xy \cdot 2^{1/4}\)

Substituting \(y = xz \cdot 2^{1/3}\) into \(x = yz \cdot \sqrt{2}\), we get:
\[
x = (xz \cdot 2^{1/3}) \cdot z \cdot \sqrt{2} \implies x = xz^2 \cdot 2^{5/6}
\]
Solving for \(z\), we find:
\[
z^2 = 2^{-5/6} \implies z = 2^{-5/12}
\]

Next, substituting \(z = 2^{-5/12}\) into \(y = xz \cdot 2^{1/3}\), we find:
\[
y = x \cdot 2^{-5/12} \cdot 2^{1/3} = x \cdot 2^{-1/12}
\]

Using \(z = xy \cdot 2^{1/4}\) and substituting \(y\), we solve for \(x\):
\[
2^{-5/12} = x \cdot (x \cdot 2^{-1/12}) \cdot 2^{1/4} \implies x^2 = 2^{-2/3} \implies x = 2^{-7/24}
\]

Then, substituting \(x\) back to find \(y\):
\[
y = 2^{-7/24} \cdot 2^{-1/12} = 2^{-3/8}
\]

Thus, we have:
\[
x = 2^{-7/24}, \quad y = 2^{-3/8}, \quad z = 2^{-5/12}
\]

To find \(\left|\log_2(x^4 y^3 z^2)\right|\), we compute:
\[
\log_2(x^4 y^3 z^2) = 4\log_2 x + 3\log_2 y + 2\log_2 z
\]
Substituting the values:
\[
4(-7/24) + 3(-9/24) + 2(-10/24) = -7/6 - 9/8 - 5/6 = -25/8
\]
Taking the absolute value:
\[
\left| -25/8 \right| = 25/8
\]
Thus, \(m = 25\) and \(n = 8\), giving \(m + n = 33\).

\(\boxed{33}\)
