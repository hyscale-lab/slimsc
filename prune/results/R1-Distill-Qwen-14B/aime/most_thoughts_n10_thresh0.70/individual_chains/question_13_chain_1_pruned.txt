Okay, so I have this problem about Aya's morning walks. Let me try to break it down.

First, Aya walks 9 kilometers every morning. She stops at a coffee shop, and the time she spends there is t minutes. The problem gives me two scenarios about her walking speed and the total time, including the coffee shop time. I need to find the total time when she walks at a speed of s + 1/2 km/h, including the t minutes.

Hmm. Let me jot down what I know.

In the first scenario:
- Speed: s km/h
- Time taken: 4 hours including t minutes at the coffee shop.

Wait, time is in hours, but part of it is in minutes. So, the total time is 4 hours, which includes both walking and the coffee stop. Similarly, the second scenario says 2 hours and 24 minutes, which also includes t minutes of coffee time.

Wait, so both times include the coffee shop time. So the walking time plus t equals the total time given.

So, let me represent the total time in the first scenario as 4 hours, which is 4*60 = 240 minutes. The time she spends walking is the total time minus t, right? Similarly, in the second scenario, the total time is 2 hours and 24 minutes, which is 2*60 +24= 144 minutes. So walking time is 144 - t minutes.

But wait, walking time can also be calculated using the formula: time = distance / speed.
