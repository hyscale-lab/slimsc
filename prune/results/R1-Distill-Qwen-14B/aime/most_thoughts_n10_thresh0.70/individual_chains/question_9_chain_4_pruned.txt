Okay, so I've got this problem here: There exist real numbers x and y, both greater than 1, such that log base x of y^x equals 10, and log base y of x^{4y} also equals 10. And I need to find the product xy. Hmm, okay, let me try to unpack this step by step.

First, I remember that logarithms can be tricky, but if I can rewrite them using the change of base formula or by converting them into exponential form, maybe that will help. Let me rewrite both equations.

Starting with the first equation: log_x(y^x) = 10. I remember that log_b(a^c) = c * log_b(a), so applying that here, this becomes x * log_x(y) = 10. Hmm, that's one equation.

Similarly, the second equation is log_y(x^{4y}) = 10. Using the same property, that would be 4y * log_y(x) = 10. Okay, so now I have two equations:

1. x * log_x(y) = 10
2. 4y * log_y(x) = 10

I need to solve for x and y, but it's a bit complicated because of the logarithms with different bases. Maybe I can express both equations in terms of a single variable by using substitution or some relationship between log_x(y) and log_y(x).

I recall that log_b(a) = 1 / log_a(b). So, log_x(y) is equal to 1 / log_y(x). Let me denote log_x(y) as some variable to make it easier. Let's say, let a = log_x(y). Then, log_y(x) would be 1/a.

So, substituting into the first equation, equation 1 becomes x * a = 10. Equation 2, which is 4y * (1/a) = 10. So now I have:

1. x * a = 10
2. (4y) / a = 10

This seems more manageable. Let me write these equations:

From equation 1: x = 10 / a
From equation 2: 4y / a = 10 → 4y = 10a → y = (10a) / 4, which simplifies to y = (5a)/2.

So now I have expressions for x and y in terms of a. But I also need another equation to relate x and y, which comes from the definition of a. Remember that a = log_x(y). So, using the definition of logarithms, this means that x^a = y.

Wait, that's a crucial point. Since a = log_x(y), then y = x^a.

So now, I have y = x^a. But from earlier, I have y = (5a)/2. So, I can set these equal to each other:

x^a = (5a)/2.

But from equation 1, x is 10/a. So substituting x into the left side:

(10/a)^a = (5a)/2.

Hmm, so now I have (10/a)^a = (5a)/2. That's an equation in terms of a only. Let's see if I can solve for a here.

Let me write it again: (10/a)^a = (5a)/2.

This equation looks a bit complicated because a is both in the base and exponent. Maybe I can take the natural logarithm of both sides to bring down the exponent.

Taking ln on both sides:

ln[(10/a)^a] = ln[(5a)/2].

Using the power rule for logarithms, left side becomes a * ln(10/a), and the right side is ln(5a/2). So:

a * ln(10/a) = ln(5a/2).

Let me expand ln(10/a) as ln(10) - ln(a). So:

a * (ln(10) - ln(a)) = ln(5a) - ln(2).

Wait, ln(5a/2) is ln(5a) - ln(2). Alternatively, ln(5a/2) can be written as ln(5) + ln(a) - ln(2). Maybe that's a better way, so let me write it that way:

a * (ln(10) - ln(a)) = ln(5) + ln(a) - ln(2).

So, expanding the left side:

a ln(10) - a ln(a) = ln(5) + ln(a) - ln(2).

Hmm, let's collect like terms. Let's move all terms to the left side:

a ln(10) - a ln(a) - ln(5) - ln(a) + ln(2) = 0.

Factor where possible. Let me factor out ln(a) from the terms involving it:

a ln(10) - (a + 1) ln(a) - ln(5) + ln(2) = 0.

Hmm, this equation still seems complicated because it involves ln(a) multiplied by a and 1. It might not be straightforward to solve algebraically. Maybe I can make a substitution or assume a value for a that simplifies this equation.

Alternatively, perhaps I can let t = a, and write the equation as:

t ln(10) - (t + 1) ln(t) - ln(5) + ln(2) = 0.

But I don't see an obvious way to solve for t here. Maybe I can try plugging in some integer values for a to see if they satisfy the equation. Remember, a is log_x(y), and since x and y are both greater than 1, a should be positive.

Let me try a = 2.

Plugging a=2 into the equation:

2 ln(10) - (2 + 1) ln(2) - ln(5) + ln(2) = ?

Compute step by step:

2 ln(10) ≈ 2 * 2.302585 ≈ 4.60517

(2+1) ln(2) = 3 * 0.693147 ≈ 2.07944

So, subtracting (2+1) ln(2): 4.60517 - 2.07944 ≈ 2.52573

Then, subtract ln(5): ln(5) ≈ 1.60944, so 2.52573 - 1.60944 ≈ 0.91629

Then, add ln(2): 0.91629 + 0.693147 ≈ 1.60943

So total ≈ 1.60943, which is not zero. So a=2 is not a solution.

Wait, but that result is approximately 1.60943, which is ln(5). Hmm, interesting. Let me check if I made a calculation error.

Wait, let's compute the left-hand side:

For a=2:

Left side: 2 ln(10) - 3 ln(2) - ln(5) + ln(2)

Simplify: 2 ln(10) - 2 ln(2) - ln(5)

Which is 2 ln(10) - ln(4) - ln(5)

Since ln(4) + ln(5) = ln(20), so 2 ln(10) - ln(20) = 2 ln(10) - ln(20)

But ln(10^2) - ln(20) = ln(100) - ln(20) = ln(100/20) = ln(5) ≈ 1.6094, which is what I got earlier. So yes, it's ln(5), which is not zero. So a=2 doesn't work.

How about a=1?

Wait, a=1:

Left side: 1 * ln(10) - 2 ln(1) - ln(5) + ln(2) → ln(10) - 0 - ln(5) + ln(2) = ln(10) - ln(5) + ln(2)

Which is ln( (10 * 2)/5 ) = ln(4) ≈ 1.386, which isn't zero.

Hmm. Maybe a=3?

Wait, let's try a=3.

Left side: 3 ln(10) - 4 ln(3) - ln(5) + ln(2)

Compute:

3 ln(10) ≈ 3*2.302585 ≈ 6.90775

4 ln(3) ≈ 4*1.098612 ≈ 4.39445

So, 6.90775 - 4.39445 ≈ 2.5133

Then, subtract ln(5) ≈ 1.6094 → 2.5133 - 1.6094 ≈ 0.9039

Add ln(2) ≈
