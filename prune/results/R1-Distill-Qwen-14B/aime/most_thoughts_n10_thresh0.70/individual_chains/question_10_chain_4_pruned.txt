Okay, so I have this math problem here, and I need to figure out the sum of the elements in set A. Let me read the problem again to make sure I understand it correctly.

Alice chooses a set A of positive integers. Then Bob lists all finite nonempty sets B of positive integers with the property that the maximum element of B belongs to A. Bob's list has 2024 sets. I need to find the sum of the elements of A.

Hmm, let me break this down. So Alice picks some set A, which is a collection of positive integers. Then Bob is creating a list of all finite, non-empty sets B where each B has the property that its maximum element is in A. The number of such sets B is 2024, and from that, I need to find the sum of elements in A.

I think I should start by understanding what these sets B look like. Each B is a finite non-empty set of positive integers, and the maximum of B is in A. So, for each element a in A, Bob can create sets B where a is the maximum element. Then, for each a, how many such sets B are there?

Wait, if a is the maximum element in B, then all other elements in B must be less than a. So, for each a in A, the number of possible sets B where a is the maximum is equal to the number of subsets of {1, 2, ..., a-1}, because B can include any combination of those numbers, but it must include a.

But wait, B is a non-empty set, so for each a, the number of possible B's where a is the maximum is equal to the number of non-empty subsets of {1, 2, ..., a-1}, each union with {a}. Therefore, the number of such subsets is 2^{a-1}, because each element from 1 to a-1 can be either included or excluded, giving 2^{a-1} subsets, and since B is non-empty, but wait, the subsets of {1, ..., a-1} can be empty, but when we add a, the set B isn't empty anymore. So, the number of B's where a is the max is 2^{a-1}.

Wait, let me check that. Suppose a = 1. Then, the set B can only be {1}, because there are no elements less than
