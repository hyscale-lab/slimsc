Okay, so I have this geometry problem here. Let me read it again to make sure I understand what's being asked.

We have triangle ABC with circumcenter O and incenter I. It says that IA is perpendicular to OI. The circumradius is 13, and the inradius is 6. We need to find the product AB · AC.

Hmm, okay. So, the triangle has its circumradius (R) as 13 and inradius (r) as 6. We also know that the incenter I and the circumcenter O are such that the line from I to A is perpendicular to the line from O to I. That's an interesting condition. I need to find AB times AC.

I remember that in any triangle, the inradius r is related to the area and the semiperimeter. The formula is r = area / s, where s is the semiperimeter. Also, the area can be expressed as r*s. On the other hand, the circumradius R is related to the sides of the triangle through the formula R = (a*b*c)/(4*area), where a, b, c are the sides.

But wait, since we're asked for AB · AC, which is c · b (if AB = c and AC = b, assuming standard notation where a is BC, b is AC, c is AB). So, we need to find b*c.

Let me think about the given condition: IA is perpendicular to OI. That might give us some geometric relationships. Maybe we can express vectors or coordinates to model this.

Alternatively, perhaps using coordinate geometry. Let me consider placing the triangle in a coordinate system to make things easier. Maybe place point I at the origin? Or perhaps place O at the origin? Let's see.

If I place O at the origin, then the circumradius is 13, so all the vertices lie on a circle of radius 13 centered at O. The incenter I is some point inside the circle, at a distance IO from O. Since IA is perpendicular to OI, that would mean that IA is perpendicular to the line segment OI. So, if I is not at O, then we can model this as a right angle between IA and OI.

Wait, perhaps it's better to set coordinates such that O is at (0,0) and I is at some point (h, k). Then, since
