Okay, so I have this problem here: I need to find the largest possible real part of the expression (75 + 117i)z + (96 + 144i)/z, where z is a complex number with |z| = 4. Hmm, alright, let's try to break this down.

First, I remember that for any complex number z, if |z| = r, then the conjugate of z, denoted as \overline{z}, is equal to r² / z. Since here |z| = 4, that means |z|² = 16. So, \overline{z} = 16 / z. I think this might come in handy somewhere.

But wait, before that, maybe I should express z in terms of its real and imaginary parts. Let me write z as a + bi, where a and b are real numbers. Since |z| = 4, we have a² + b² = 16. That's a constraint on a and b.

So, the expression becomes (75 + 117i)(a + bi) + (96 + 144i)/(a + bi). Hmm, that seems a bit messy, but maybe if I can simplify it, I can find the real part.

Let me compute each part step by step. First, compute (75 + 117i)(a + bi):

Multiplying these two complex numbers:

= 75a + 75bi + 117i a + 117i * bi
= 75a + 75bi + 117a i + 117b i²

Since i² = -1, that becomes:

= 75a + 75bi + 117a i - 117b

Now, let's collect the real and imaginary parts:

Real part: 75a - 117b
Imaginary part: 75b + 117a

So, the first term is (75a - 117b) + (75b + 117a)i.

Next, compute the second term: (96 + 144i)/(a + bi). To simplify this, I can multiply the numerator and denominator by the conjugate of the denominator, which is a - bi.

So:

(96 + 144i)/(a + bi) = [(96 + 144i)(a - bi)] / (a² + b²)

Since a² + b² = 16, the denominator is 16. So we have:

= [(96a - 96bi + 144a i - 144b i²)] / 16

Again, i² = -1, so:

= [96a - 96bi + 144a i + 144b] / 16

Now, group real and imaginary parts:

Real part: (96a + 144b) / 16
Imaginary part: (-96b + 144a) / 16

Simplify each:

Real part: (96a + 144b)/16 = 6a + 9b
Imaginary part: (-96b + 144a)/16 = -6b + 9a

So, the second term is (6a + 9b) + (-6b + 9a)i.

Now, let's add the two terms together:

First term: (75a - 117b) + (75b + 117a)i
Second term: (6a + 9b) + (-6b + 9a)i

Add real parts and imaginary parts:

Real part: (75a - 117b) + (6a + 9b) = (75a + 6a) + (-117b + 9b) = 81a - 108b

Imaginary part: (75b + 117a) + (-6b + 9a) = (75b - 6b) + (117a + 9a) = 69b + 126a

So, the entire expression is (81a - 108b) + (69b + 126a)i.

But the problem asks for the largest possible real part. So, I need to maximize Re = 81a - 108b, given that a² + b² = 16.

Okay, so it's an optimization problem with a quadratic constraint. Maybe I can use the method of Lagrange multipliers here.

Let me set up the function to maximize: f(a, b) = 81a - 108b
Subject to constraint: g(a, b) = a² + b² - 16 = 0

Using Lagrange multipliers, we have gradient f = λ gradient g.

Compute gradients:

∇f = (81, -108)
∇g = (2a, 2b)

So, setting up the equations:

81 = λ * 2a  ---> 81 = 2λ a --> Equation 1
-108 = λ * 2b --> -108 = 2λ b --> Equation 2

Also, the constraint a² + b² =16 --> Equation 3.

From Equation 1: λ = 81/(2a)
From Equation 2: λ = -108/(2b) = -54/b

So, set equal:

81/(2a) = -54 / b

Cross-multiplying:

81b = -54 * 2a
81b = -108a
Divide both sides by 9:

9b = -12a
Simplify: 3b = -4a  --> b = (-4/3) a

Now, substitute into the constraint equation (Equation 3):

a² + b² = 16
a² + (16/9) a² =16
Multiply through by 9 to eliminate denominator:

9a² +16a² = 144
25a² =144
a² = 144/25
a= ±12/5

So, a = 12/5 or a= -12/5

Compute b for each case:

Case 1: a=12/5
b= (-4/3)(12/5) = (-48)/15 = -16/5

Case 2: a= -12/5
b= (-4/3)(-12/5) = 48/15 = 16/5

Now, compute f(a,b) for each case.

Case 1: a=12/5, b=-16/5
f =81*(12/5) -108*(-16/5)
= (81*12 + 108*16)/5
Calculate numerator:
81*12 = 972
108*16 = 1728
Total numerator: 972 +1728 = 2700
So, f=2700/5=540

Case 2: a=-12/5, b=16/5
f=81*(-12/5) -108*(16/5)
= (-972 -1728)/5
= (-2700)/5= -540

So, the maximum real part is 540. Is that possible? Let me double-check my calculations.

Wait, 81 times 12 is indeed 972. 108 times 16 is 1728. Adding them gives 2700, divided by 5 is 540. That seems correct.

Alternatively, is there another method? Maybe using polar form? Let me consider z as 4 e^{iθ}, since |z|=4.

Let me try that approach.

Express z as 4 e^{iθ}, so 1/z = (1/4) e^{-iθ}.

Then, the expression becomes:

(75 + 117i)*4 e^{iθ} + (96 + 144i)*(1/4) e^{-iθ}

Simplify:

= [4*(75 + 117i) e^{iθ}] + [(96 + 144i)/4 e^{-iθ}]
= [300 + 468i] e^{iθ} + [24 + 36i] e^{-iθ}

Let me write each complex number in terms of their real and imaginary components.

Let me denote A = 300 + 468i and B = 24 + 36i.

So, expression is A e^{iθ} + B e^{-iθ}.

Compute the real part of this expression. Remember that Re(A e^{iθ}) = Re(A) cosθ - Im(A) sinθ, and similarly for B e^{-iθ}: Re(B e^{-iθ}) = Re(B) cosθ + Im(B) sinθ.

Wait, more precisely, using Euler's formula:

Re(A e^{iθ}) = Re(A) cosθ - Im(A) sinθ
Re(B e^{-iθ}) = Re(B) cosθ + Im(B) sinθ

So, the total real part is:

[Re(A) cosθ - Im(A) sinθ] + [Re(B) cosθ + Im(B) sinθ]
= (Re(A) + Re(B)) cosθ + (-Im(A) + Im(B)) sinθ

Let's compute the coefficients:

Re(A) = 300, Re(B) =24. So Re(A) + Re(B) = 324.

Im(A) =468, Im(B)=36. So -Im(A) + Im(B) = -468 +36 = -432.

So, the real part is 324 cosθ -432 sinθ.

We need to find the maximum value of 324 cosθ -432 sinθ.

Hmm, that's a standard expression for maximum of a linear combination of sine and cosine. The maximum value is the amplitude, which is sqrt( (324)^2 + (-432)^2 ).

Compute this:

First, compute 324 squared: 324^2 = (18^2)*(9^2) = 324*324. Wait, 324 *324: 300²=90000, 2*300*24=14400, 24²=576. So, 90000 +14400 +576= 105, 90000+14400=104400, +576=104,976.

Similarly, 432^2: 400²=160000, 2*400*32=25600, 32²=1024. Sum is 160000+25600=185600 +1024=186,624.

So, sum of squares: 104976 + 186624 = 291,600.

Square root of 291600: Let me see. 540^2 is 291600 because 500²=250000, 40²=1600, 2*500*40=40000. So, 500+40=540, 540² = (500+40)^2 = 500² + 2*500*40 +40²= 250000 +40000 +1600= 291,600.

So, the maximum real part is 540. So, that matches the previous result.

Therefore, the largest possible real part is 540.

Wait, but just to be thorough, in the first approach where I expressed z as a + bi, I found that the maximum Re is 540. In the polar form approach, I also got 540. So, that's consistent. So, I think 540 is the correct answer.

Just to recap: using Lagrange multipliers, I found that with a =12/5 and b= -16/5, the real part is 540. Using the polar form, I converted the expression into a form involving cosθ and sinθ, found the maximum amplitude, which was also 540. So, both methods lead me to the same conclusion.

I think that's solid. So, the largest possible real part is 540.


To find the largest possible real part of the expression \((75 + 117i)z + \frac{96 + 144i}{z}\) where \(|z| = 4\), we can approach the problem using both algebraic and polar form methods.

### Algebraic Method:
1. **Express \(z\) as \(a + bi\)** with \(a^2 + b^2 = 16\).
2. **Expand the expression**:
   \[
   (75 + 117i)(a + bi) + \frac{96 + 144i}{a + bi}
   \]
   Simplifying each part:
   - The first term becomes \((75a - 117b) + (75b + 117a)i\).
   - The second term becomes \((6a + 9b) + (-6b + 9a)i\).
3. **Combine real and imaginary parts**:
   - Real part: \(81a - 108b\).
   - Imaginary part: \(69b + 126a\).
4. **Maximize the real part \(81a - 108b\)** subject to \(a^2 + b^2 = 16\) using Lagrange multipliers. Solving the system, we find \(a = \frac{12}{5}\) and \(b = -\frac{16}{5}\), leading to a maximum real part of 540.

### Polar Form Method:
1. **Express \(z\) as \(4e^{i\theta}\)**, so \(1/z = \frac{1}{4}e^{-i\theta}\).
2. **Rewrite the expression**:
   \[
   [300 + 468i]e^{i\theta} + [24 + 36i]e^{-i\theta}
   \]
3. **Compute the real part**:
   - Real part: \(324\cos\theta - 432\sin\theta\).
4. **Find the maximum value** using the amplitude formula:
   \[
   \sqrt{324^2 + (-432)^2} = 540
   \]

Both methods confirm that the largest possible real part is \(\boxed{540}\). 

**Answer:** \(\boxed{540}\)
