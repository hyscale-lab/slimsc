Okay, so I've got this problem to solve. It's about finding the number of triples of nonnegative integers (a, b, c) that satisfy two conditions: their sum is 300, and another expression involving their squares and products equals 6,000,000. Hmm, that sounds a bit tricky, but let's break it down step by step.

First, let me write down what's given. The equations are:

1. a + b + c = 300
2. a²b + a²c + b²a + b²c + c²a + c²b = 6,000,000

I need to find all nonnegative integer solutions (a, b, c) that satisfy both equations.

Hmm, okay. So, the first equation is linear, and the second one is quadratic in terms of a, b, c. Maybe I can find a way to relate these two equations somehow.

Looking at the second equation, I notice that each term is a product of a square and another variable. So, for example, a²b is a squared times b, and similarly for the others. Maybe I can factor or rearrange this expression.

Let me think about factoring. If I group terms, perhaps I can factor out some common terms. Let's see:

a²b + a²c = a²(b + c)
Similarly, b²a + b²c = b²(a + c)
And c²a + c²b = c²(a + b)

So, the entire expression becomes:

a²(b + c) + b²(a + c) + c²(a + b) = 6,000,000

Hmm, that looks a bit better. Maybe I can express this in terms of the first equation since we know that a + b + c = 300.

Wait, since a + b + c = 300, then b + c = 300 - a, a + c = 300 - b, and a + b = 300 - c.

So, substituting those into the second equation:

a²(300 - a) + b²(300 - b) + c²(300 - c) = 6,000,000

That's interesting. So now, the equation is in terms of a, b, c each multiplied by (300 minus themselves). Let me write that out:

a²(300 - a) + b²(300 - b) + c²(300 - c) = 6,000,000

Hmm, maybe I can expand each term:

a² * 300 - a³ + b² * 300 - b³ + c² * 300 - c³ = 6,000,000

So, factor out the 300:

300(a² + b² + c²) - (a³ + b³ + c³) = 6,000,000

Hmm, that's a useful form. Let me denote S = a + b + c = 300, Q = ab + bc + ca, and P = abc. Maybe if I can express a² + b² + c² and a³ + b³ + c³ in terms of S, Q, and P.

I know that a² + b² + c² = S² - 2Q. Yeah, because (a + b + c)² = a² + b² + c² + 2(ab + bc + ca). So, rearranging, a² + b² + c² = S² - 2Q.

Similarly, for a³ + b³ + c³, I remember the identity:

a³ + b³ + c³ = (a + b + c)^3 - 3(a + b + c)(ab + bc + ca) + 3abc

So, that's S³ - 3SQ + 3P.

So, substituting back into our equation:

300(a² + b² + c²) - (a³ + b³ + c³) = 6,000,000

Which becomes:

300(S² - 2Q) - (S³ - 3SQ + 3P) = 6,000,000

Since S = 300, let's substitute that in:

300(300² - 2Q) - (300³ - 3*300*Q + 3P) = 6,000,000

Let me compute each part step by step.

First, 300*(300² - 2Q):

300² is 90,000. So, 300*(90,000 - 2Q) = 300*90,000 - 300*2Q = 27,000,000 - 600Q.

Next, (300³ - 3*300*Q + 3P):

300³ is 27,000,000.

3*300*Q is 900Q.

So, the entire term is 27,000,000 - 900Q + 3P.

Putting it all together:

[27,000,000 - 600Q] - [27,000,000 - 900Q + 3P] = 6,000,000

Let me distribute the negative sign:

27,000,000 - 600Q - 27,000,000 + 900Q - 3P = 6,000,000

Simplify the terms:

27,000,000 - 27,000,000 cancels out.

-600Q + 900Q = 300Q

So, 300Q - 3P = 6,000,000

Divide both sides by 3:

100Q - P = 2,000,000

So, we have the equation:

100Q - P = 2,000,000  →  P = 100Q - 2,000,000

Hmm. So, now I have expressions for Q and P in terms of each other. But how does this help me?

Wait, I also know that S = a + b + c = 300, Q = ab + bc + ca, and P = abc. So, the monic cubic equation with roots a, b, c is:

x³ - Sx² + Qx - P = 0

Which would be:

x³ - 300x² + Qx - P = 0

But since P = 100Q - 2,000,000, we can write:

x³ - 300x² + Qx - (100Q - 2,000,000) = 0

Simplify:

x³ - 300x² + Qx - 100Q + 2,000,000 = 0

Hmm, let's factor terms with Q:

x³ - 300x² + (Q)(x - 100) + 2,000,000 = 0

I'm not sure if that's helpful. Maybe I can write the equation as:

x³ - 300x² + Qx - 100Q + 2,000,000 = 0

Hmm, perhaps rearrange terms:

x³ - 300x² + 2,000,000 + Q(x - 100) = 0

Still unclear. Maybe I should think about possible integer solutions. Since a, b, c are nonnegative integers, perhaps they can be expressed in some symmetric way.

Alternatively, maybe I can find constraints on a, b, c. Let's think about whether a, b, c are equal or have some symmetry.

Wait, let me consider symmetric triples where a = b = c. Since a + b + c = 300, each would be 100. Let me check if this satisfies the second equation.

Compute a²b + a²c + b²a + b²c + c²a + c²b.

Since a = b = c = 100, each term is 100² * 100 = 100³. There are six terms, so 6 * 100³.

100³ is 1,000,000, so 6,000,000. Oh, that matches the given equation. So, (100, 100, 100) is a solution.

But are there other solutions? The problem asks for the number of triples, so maybe there are more.

Alternatively, maybe all solutions are permutations of (100, 100, 100), but that might not be the case.

Wait, but let's think. Suppose two variables are equal, say a = b, and c is different. Let me see if that can also satisfy the equations.

Let me assume a = b, so then 2a + c = 300 → c = 300 - 2a.

Now, let's compute the second equation. Since a = b, the expression becomes:

a²a + a²c + a²a + a²c + c²a + c²a

Wait, that's 2*(a³) + 2*(a²c) + 2*(c²a)

So, 2a³ + 2a²c + 2c²a = 2(a³ + a²c + c²a)
