Okay, so I have this geometry problem here, and I need to find the length of AP in the triangle ABC. The triangle is inscribed in a circle ω. The tangents at B and C to ω meet at point D, and then line AD intersects ω again at point P. The sides are given: AB is 5, BC is 9, and AC is 10. I need to find AP expressed as a fraction m/n where m and n are coprime, and then find m + n.

Hmm, let's start by recalling some geometry concepts. Since ABC is inscribed in a circle, it's a cyclic triangle, and the circle is its circumcircle. The point D is the intersection of the tangents at B and C. I remember that the point where two tangents meet is called the exsymmedian point or sometimes the symmedian point, but I'm not entirely sure. Wait, no, the symmedian point is inside the triangle, but D is outside because it's the intersection of two tangents. So D is actually the ex-symmedian point or maybe the ex-pole of some line.

Wait, another thought: the tangent from a point to a circle are equal in length. So the lengths DB and DC should be equal because they're both tangents from D to the circle ω. That might come in handy later.

So, D is the external point from which two tangents DB and DC are drawn to the circle ω. Then AD intersects ω again at P, so P is the second intersection point of AD with ω.

I think I can use power of a point here. The power of point D with respect to ω is DB² = DC² = DP * DA. Because D lies outside the circle, and AD passes through the circle, intersecting it at A and P. So, the power of D is equal to DP * DA.

Wait, let me write that down. Power of D: DB² = DP * DA. So, DP = DB² / DA.

But to find DP, I need DA first. Alternatively, maybe I can express DA in terms of other known quantities. But I don't have DA yet.

Wait, but perhaps I can find DA using triangle ABC. Since I know the sides of triangle ABC, maybe I can find some lengths or angles that can help me find DA.

Alternatively, maybe using coordinate geometry or trigonometry could help. Let me think about the properties of the triangle.

First, I can find the circumradius of triangle ABC because I know all three sides. Then, maybe I can find the coordinates of the points and compute DA.

Wait, let me try to compute the circumradius. The formula for the circumradius R of a triangle with sides a, b, c is R = (a b c) / (4 Δ), where Δ is the area of the triangle.

Given AB = 5, BC = 9, AC = 10. Let's assign the sides properly. Let me label the sides as follows: let a = BC = 9, b = AC = 10, c = AB = 5. So, using the standard notation, where a is opposite angle A, but wait, actually, in standard notation, a is opposite angle A. Wait, no, in standard notation, side a is opposite angle A, which is BC. So yes, a = 9, b = AC = 10, c = AB = 5.

So first, compute the area Δ. Using Heron's formula: s = (a + b + c)/2 = (9 + 10 + 5)/2 = (24)/2 = 12.

Then Δ = √[s(s - a)(s - b)(s - c)] = √[12(12 - 9)(12 - 10)(12 - 5)] = √[12 * 3 * 2 * 7] = √(504). Let's compute that: 504 = 16 * 31.5? Wait, 504 factors: 504 = 16 * 31.5? Wait, no. 504 = 16 * 31.5 is incorrect because 16 * 31.5 is 504, but 31.5 is not an integer. Let me factor 504 properly.

504 ÷ 2 = 252

252 ÷ 2 = 126

126 ÷ 2 = 63

63 ÷ 3 = 21

21 ÷ 3 = 7

So 504 = 2^3 * 3^2 * 7. So sqrt(504) = 2^(3/2) * 3 *
