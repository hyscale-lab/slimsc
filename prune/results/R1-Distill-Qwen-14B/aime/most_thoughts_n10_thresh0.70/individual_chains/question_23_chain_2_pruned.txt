Okay, so I have this problem here: there's a hyperbola given by the equation x²/20 - y²/24 = 1. Points A, B, C, D lie on this hyperbola, forming a rhombus ABCD. The diagonals of this rhombus intersect at the origin. I need to find the greatest real number that is less than BD² for all such rhombi. Hmm, okay, let me try to break this down.

First, let me recall that a rhombus is a quadrilateral with all sides equal, and its diagonals bisect each other at right angles. Wait, no, actually, in a rhombus, the diagonals bisect each other and the angles, but they aren't necessarily perpendicular unless it's a square. Wait, no, actually, yes, in a rhombus, the diagonals are perpendicular. Right, so the diagonals intersect at right angles and bisect each other.

Since the diagonals intersect at the origin, that means the origin is the midpoint of both diagonals. So, if A is a point (x, y), then the opposite point C would be (-x, -y). Similarly, points B and D would be related in the same way. So, points are in pairs: A and C are opposites, B and D are opposites.

So, let's say points A, B, C, D are such that A is (x1, y1), so C is (-x1, -y1). Similarly, B is (x2, y2), so D is (-x2, -y2).

Since all four points lie on the hyperbola x²/20 - y²/24 = 1, both A and C satisfy this equation, and so do B and D.

Now, since ABCD is a rhombus, all sides are equal. So, the distance between A and B should equal the distance between B and C, which should equal the distance between C and D, and so on.

Wait, maybe there's a better approach. Since the diagonals intersect at the origin and are perpendicular, maybe we can parameterize the points based on the slopes of the diagonals.

Wait, let me think in terms of vectors. Since diagonals intersect at the origin and bisect each other, the diagonals are essentially vectors from the origin to the points. So, the diagonals are AC
