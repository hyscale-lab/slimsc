Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this problem about a torus and a sphere. Let me start by understanding the setup. 

So, we have a torus T, which is created by revolving a circle of radius 3 around an axis that's in the same plane as the circle and 6 units away from the center of the circle. So, imagine taking a circle (like a ring with radius 3) and spinning it around a line that's 6 units away from its center. This creates a donut-shaped surface, which is the torus.

Then we have a sphere S with radius 11. The problem says that when T rests on the inside of S, it's internally tangent along a circle with radius r_i, and when it rests on the outside, it's externally tangent along a circle with radius r_o. We need to find the difference r_i - r_o and express it as a fraction m/n where m and n are coprime, then find m + n.

Alright, let me visualize this. When the torus is inside the sphere, it touches the sphere along a circle. Similarly, when it's outside, it touches along another circle. The radii of these circles are r_i and r_o, and we need to find their difference.

First, I think I need to find the radii of the circles of tangency in both cases. To do that, perhaps I should figure out the geometry of the torus and sphere.

I remember that a torus can be described using two radii: the major radius R, which is the distance from the center of the generating circle to the axis of revolution, and the minor radius r, which is the radius of the generating circle itself. In this case, R is 6 and r is 3. So, the torus has R = 6 and r = 3.

When the torus is inside the sphere, it's tangent to the sphere along a circle. Similarly, when it's outside, it's tangent along another circle. I need to find the radius of these circles of tangency.

Let me think about the sphere of radius 11. When the torus is inside, the sphere is larger, so the point of tangency will occur somewhere on the inner part of the torus. Conversely, when the torus is outside, the sphere is smaller relative to the torus, so the tangency is on the outer part.

Wait, but actually, in both cases, the sphere has the same radius, 11. So when the torus is inside, it's resting on the inside of the sphere, so the sphere is outside the torus, and the torus is inside, touching the sphere. When the torus is outside, it's enclosing the sphere, so the sphere is inside the torus, and they touch along a circle.

Hmm, perhaps I should model the positions mathematically.

Let me consider the centers of these two surfaces. The torus is a surface of revolution, so its center is a circle of radius R = 6. The sphere has radius 11. When the torus is inside the sphere, the sphere's center is at a certain distance from the torus's center, and when it's outside, the distance is different.

Wait, maybe I should think of the sphere and the torus touching each other. The point of tangency is a circle, so the centers of the sphere and the torus must lie along the same axis, and the line connecting their centers must pass through the point of tangency.

But wait, the torus is a more complex shape. Maybe it's better to think in terms of the distance between the centers of the sphere and the torus.

Wait, actually, the torus can be thought of as a surface generated by a circle moving around the axis. So, the distance from the center of the sphere to the center of the generating circle of the torus might be important.

Wait, perhaps I should parameterize the torus and sphere, then find the points where they
