Okay, so Alice and Bob are playing a game with a stack of n tokens. They take turns removing either 1 or 4 tokens each time. Alice goes first. The person who takes the last token wins. I need to figure out for how many positive integers n ≤ 2024 Bob has a winning strategy, no matter how Alice plays.

Hmm, let me think about how these kinds of games work. It sounds like a classic combinatorial game, probably involving the concept of winning and losing positions. A winning position is one where the current player can force a win no matter what the opponent does. A losing position is one where no matter what the current player does, the opponent can force a win.

So, the idea is to find all n where Bob can force a win. Since Alice goes first, if the starting position n is a losing position for the first player (Alice), then Bob can win. So I need to find all n ≤ 2024 where n is a losing position for the first player.

Let me try to model this. Let's denote the positions as either winning (W) or losing (L). The base case is when there are no tokens left. If it's your turn and there are no tokens, you lose because you can't make a move. So n=0 is a losing position. But wait, in our problem, the player who takes the last token wins. So if n=1, the first player takes 1 token and wins. So n=1 is a winning position. Similarly, n=4: the first player can take 4 tokens and win. So n=4 is W.

Wait, but what about n=2? The first player can take 1 token, leaving 1 for the second player, who can then take it and win. Wait, no, because if the first player takes 1 from n=2, the second player is left with 1, which is a W position for them. So the second player can win. Alternatively, the first player can take 4, but n=2 is less than 4, so they can only take 1. So n=2 is a losing position for the first player. So Bob can win if n=2 because whatever Alice does, Bob can win.

Wait, let me clarify:

Let me try to list out the positions step by step.

n=0: losing (L) because you can't move.
n=1:
