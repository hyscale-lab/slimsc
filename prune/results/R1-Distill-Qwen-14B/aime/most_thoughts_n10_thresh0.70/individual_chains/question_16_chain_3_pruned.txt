Okay, so I've got this math problem here, and I'm trying to figure out how to approach it. Let me read it again: 

Let p be the least prime number for which there exists a positive integer n such that n^4 + 1 is divisible by p^2. Find the least positive integer m such that m^4 + 1 is divisible by p^2.

Hmm, okay. So I need to find the smallest prime p where there's some n where p squared divides n^4 + 1. Then, once I have that p, find the smallest m where m^4 + 1 is divisible by p squared.

Let me start by understanding what this means. So, n^4 ≡ -1 mod p^2. So, n^8 ≡ 1 mod p^2. That implies that the order of n modulo p^2 divides 8. But wait, n^4 ≡ -1 mod p^2, so the order can't be 4 because n^4 ≡ -1, not 1. So, the order must be 8. That suggests that 8 divides the order of the multiplicative group modulo p^2, which is φ(p^2) = p(p-1) if p is prime.

So, for the multiplicative group modulo p^2 to have an element of order 8, 8 must divide φ(p^2) = p(p-1). So p must be such that either p divides 8 or p-1 divides 8. Since p is prime, p can be 2 or a prime where p ≡ 1 mod 8.

Wait, let's think about that. If 8 divides p(p-1), then either p divides 8 or p-1 divides 8. Since p is prime, p can only be 2 or a prime where p-1 is divisible by 8, so p ≡ 1 mod 8.

But we're looking for the smallest such prime. So, let me list primes and see. The primes are 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, etc.

Let me check p=2 first. Let's see if there exists an n such that n^4 +1 is divisible by 4 (since p^2=4). So, n^4 ≡ -1 mod 4.

But wait, n^4 mod 4: Let's compute for n=1: 1 mod 4. n=2: 0 mod 4. n=3: 1 mod 4. So n^4 is either 0 or 1 mod 4. So n^4 ≡ -1 mod 4 would mean 1 ≡ -1 mod 4, which is 2 ≡ 0 mod 4? No, that's not possible. So there's no solution for p=2. So p=2 is out.

Next prime is 3. Check if there's an n where n^4 ≡ -1 mod 9. Let me compute n^4 mod
