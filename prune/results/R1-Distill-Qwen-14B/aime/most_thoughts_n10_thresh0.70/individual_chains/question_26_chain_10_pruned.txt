Okay, let's try to solve this geometry problem. Hmm, okay, so we have triangle ABC inscribed in circle ω. The tangents at B and C meet at point D, and then AD intersects ω again at P. We're given AB=5, BC=9, and AC=10. We need to find AP expressed as a reduced fraction m/n and then compute m + n.

First, I should probably draw a diagram to visualize the problem. But since there's already an Asymptote figure provided, maybe I can imagine it based on the description. Triangle ABC with sides 5, 9, 10. Let me note that down.

Wait, so ABC has sides AB=5, BC=9, AC=10. Let me check if it's a valid triangle. The sum of AB and BC is 14, which is greater than AC=10. Similarly, other sides also satisfy the triangle inequality, so that's fine.

Since ABC is inscribed in circle ω, ω is its circumcircle. The tangents at B and C meet at D. So, D is the ex-pole or something? Wait, the point where two tangents meet is called the exsimilicenter or something else? Hmm, maybe not. Wait, for a circle, the point where two tangents from an external point meet is the external point itself. So, D is the external point from which two tangents are drawn to the circle ω, touching at B and C.

So, by the property of tangents, DB = DC because the two tangent segments from a single external point to a circle are equal in length. So, triangle DBC is isoceles with DB = DC.

Now, AD intersects ω again at P. So, AP is the segment from A to P, passing through D. We need to find the length of AP.

Hmm, how can I approach this? Maybe using power of a point. D is outside the circle, and from D, we have two tangent segments DB and DC, which are equal. Also, AD is a secant that intersects the circle at A and P.

Wait, so by the power of point D with respect to ω, the power should be equal to DB² = DA * DP.

Let me write that down:
