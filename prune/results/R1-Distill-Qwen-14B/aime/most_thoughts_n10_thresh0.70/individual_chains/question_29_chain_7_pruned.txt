Okay, so I've got this geometry problem in front of me, and I need to find the length of CE. Let me read through the problem again to make sure I understand all the details.

There are two rectangles, ABCD and EFGH. Points D, E, C, F are collinear. That means they all lie on a straight line. Also, points A, D, H, G all lie on a circle. So those four points are concyclic or lie on the same circumference. The given lengths are BC = 16, AB = 107, FG = 17, and EF = 184. I need to find CE.

Let me try to visualize this. I imagine rectangle ABCD, so the sides AB and CD are 107 units long, and the sides BC and AD are 16 units each. Then there's another rectangle EFGH. Since EF = 184 and FG = 17, so EF is the length of the rectangle EFGH, and FG is the width.

The points D, E, C, F are collinear. So the line passes through D, E, C, F. So maybe E is between D and C, and F is beyond C? Or maybe the other way around? Hmm, not sure yet.

Also, A, D, H, G lie on a circle. So that must mean that the quadrilateral ADHG is cyclic. Which might give us some properties to work with, like cyclic quadrilateral theorems.

I think I should start by drawing a diagram. Since I can't actually draw it, I'll try to imagine it.

Let me denote the coordinates of the points to make this easier. Let's assign coordinates to the points.

Let's place point D at the origin (0,0) for simplicity. Since ABCD is a rectangle, and D is at (0,0), then point C would be at (107, 0) because BC is 16, and AB is 107. Wait, no, ABCD is a rectangle, so if AB is 107, then AB is the length, and BC is 16, the width.

Wait, actually, in rectangle ABCD, AB is one side, BC is another. So if AB is 107, then CD is also 107. BC is 16, so AD is also 16.

So if D is at (0,0), then C would be at (107,0), B at (0,16), and A at (0,16)? Wait, no, wait. Wait, ABCD is a rectangle, so the points go in order. Let me correct that.

Wait, if ABCD is a rectangle, then the order is A, B, C, D. So if I'm placing D at (0,0), then C would be at (something, 0). Let me think.

Wait, perhaps it's better to assign coordinates such that point D is at (0,0). Then, since ABCD is a rectangle, moving from D to C is along the x-axis, so C is (a,0). Then, moving up from
