Okay, so I've got this complex math problem here. Let me try to figure it out step by step. The problem is to find the largest possible real part of the expression \[(75 + 117i)z + \frac{96 + 144i}{z}\], where \( z \) is a complex number with \( |z| = 4 \). Hmm, alright. Let me see.

First, I know that \( z \) is a complex number on the circle with radius 4. So, \( z \) can be written in the form \( z = 4e^{i\theta} \), where \( \theta \) is the argument of \( z \). That might come in handy later.

The expression we need to maximize the real part of is \[(75 + 117i)z + \frac{96 + 144i}{z}\]. Let me denote this expression as \( E \). So, \( E = (75 + 117i)z + \frac{96 + 144i}{z} \).

Since \( |z| = 4 \), the reciprocal \( \frac{1}{z} \) would be \( \frac{\overline{z}}{|z|^2} \), which is \( \frac{\overline{z}}{16} \). Because \( |z|^2 = 16 \). So, \( \frac{1}{z} = \frac{\overline{z}}{16} \).

Let me rewrite \( E \) using this substitution:

\( E = (75 + 117i)z + \frac{96 + 144i}{z} = (75 + 117i)z + \frac{96 + 144i}{16} \cdot \overline{z} \).

Simplify the constants:

\( \frac{96}{16} = 6 \) and \( \frac{144}{16} = 9 \). So, \( E = (75 + 117i)z + (6 + 9i)\overline{z} \).

Now, let's express \( z \) and \( \overline{z} \) in terms of \( \theta \). Since \( z = 4e^{i\theta} \), then \( \overline{z} = 4e^{-i\theta} \).

Substituting these into \( E \):

\( E = (75 + 117i)(4e^{i\theta}) + (6 + 9i)(4e^{-i\theta}) \).

Let me compute each term separately.

First term: \( (75 + 117i)(4e^{i\theta}) = 4(75 + 117i)e^{i\theta} \).

Second term: \( (6 + 9i)(4e^{-i\theta}) = 4(6 + 9i)e^{-i\theta} \).

So, \( E = 4(75 + 117i)e^{i\theta} + 4(6 + 9i)e^{-i\theta} \).

Let me compute the coefficients:

4*(75 + 117i) = 300 + 468i,

4*(6 + 9i) = 24 + 36i.

So, \( E = (300 + 468i)e^{i\theta} + (24 + 36i)e^{-i\theta} \).

Now, I can write each exponential term using Euler's formula: \( e^{i\theta} = \cos\theta + i\sin\theta \), and \( e^{-i\theta} = \cos\theta - i\sin\theta \).

Let's compute each product.

First term: (300 + 468i)(cosθ + i sinθ).

Multiplying this out:

= 300 cosθ + 300i sinθ + 468i cosθ + 468i^2 sinθ.

Since \( i^2 = -1 \), this becomes:

= 300 cosθ + 300i sinθ + 468i cosθ - 468 sinθ.

Grouping real and imaginary parts:

Real: 300 cosθ - 468 sinθ,

Imaginary: (300 sinθ + 468 cosθ) i.

Second term: (24 + 36i)(cosθ - i sinθ).

Multiplying this out:

= 24 cosθ - 24i sinθ + 36i cosθ - 36i^2 sinθ.

Again, \( i^2 = -1 \):

= 24 cosθ - 24i sinθ + 36i cosθ + 36 sinθ.

Grouping real and imaginary parts:

Real: 24 cosθ + 36 sinθ,

Imaginary: (-24 sinθ + 36 cosθ) i.

Now, adding both terms together to get E:

Real parts:

(300 cosθ - 468 sinθ) + (24 cosθ + 36 sinθ) =

(300 + 24) cosθ + (-468 + 36) sinθ = 324 cosθ - 432 sinθ.

Imaginary parts:

(300 sinθ + 468 cosθ) i + (-24 sinθ + 36 cosθ) i =

[300 sinθ + 468 cosθ - 24 sinθ + 36 cosθ] i =

(276 sinθ + 504 cosθ) i.

So, the entire expression E is:

E = [324 cosθ - 432 sinθ] + [276 sinθ + 504 cosθ] i.

We are interested in the real part of E, which is Re(E) = 324 cosθ - 432 sinθ.

Our goal is to find the maximum value of Re(E) as θ varies. 

So, Re(E) = 324 cosθ - 432 sinθ.

This is a linear combination of sine and cosine, so we can write this as R cos(θ + φ), where R is the amplitude and φ is the phase shift.

Alternatively, we can compute the maximum value using calculus or by recognizing it as the dot product of vectors.

The maximum value of Re(E) will be the magnitude of the vector (324, -432). Because the expression is of the form A cosθ + B sinθ, which has a maximum of sqrt(A^2 + B^2).

Wait, but in our case, it's 324 cosθ - 432 sinθ. So, A = 324, B = -432.

So, the maximum value of Re(E) is sqrt(324^2 + (-432)^2).

Wait, let me compute that.

Compute 324^2: 324 * 324. Let me compute 300^2 = 90000, 24^2=576, and 2*300*24=14400. So, (300+24)^2 = 300^2 + 2*300*24 +24^2 = 90000 + 14400 + 576 = 105, 90000+14400 is 104400, +576 is 104,976. So, 324^2 = 104,976.

Similarly, (-432)^2 = 432^2.

Compute 400^2=160,000, 32^2=1,024, 2*400*32=25,600. So, (400+32)^2 = 160,000 + 25,600 + 1,024 = 160,000 +25,600=185,600 + 1,024=186,624. So, 432^2=186,624.

Thus, R = sqrt(104,976 + 186,624) = sqrt(291,600).

What is sqrt(291,600)?

Well, sqrt(291600) = sqrt(2916 * 100) = sqrt(2916) * 10.

I know that 54^2 = 2916, because 50^2=2500, 54^2=2916.

So, sqrt(2916) =54, so sqrt(291600) =54*10=540.

Therefore, the maximum value of Re(E) is 540.

Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the calculation. Let me recheck:

324^2 = (300 +24)^2 = 300^2 + 2*300*24 +24^2 = 90,000 + 14,400 + 576 = 90,000 +14,400=104,400 +576=104,976. Correct.

432^2= (400 +32)^2=400^2 +2*400*32 +32^2=160,000 +25,600 +1,024=160,000+25,600=185,600 +1,024=186,624. Correct.

Sum: 104,976 + 186,624 = 291,600. Correct.

sqrt(291,600)=sqrt(2916 * 100)=sqrt(2916)*sqrt(100)=54*10=540. Correct.

So the maximum real part is 540.

Wait, but let me think again. Is this the correct approach? Because I treated Re(E) as a function of θ, which is a sinusoidal function, and found its maximum value as sqrt(A^2 + B^2). That's correct because Re(E) = A cosθ + B sinθ, which can be written as R cos(θ - φ), where R = sqrt(A² + B²), and φ is such that cosφ = A/R, sinφ = B/R.

Thus, the maximum of Re(E) is R, which is 540. So, yes, that's correct.

I don't think I missed anything. So, the answer should be 540.


The largest possible real part is achieved when the expression is maximized, which occurs when the real part is equal to the magnitude of the vector formed by the coefficients of cosine and sine. This magnitude is calculated as 540.

\boxed{540}
