Okay, so I've got this problem here: 

There exist real numbers x and y, both greater than 1, such that log base x of (y^x) equals 10, and log base y of (x^{4y}) also equals 10. I need to find the product xy.

Hmm, let me break it down. I remember logarithm properties, so maybe I can rewrite these equations using those properties.

First, the equation log_x(y^x) = 10. Using the logarithm power rule, which says log_b(a^k) = k*log_b(a), I can rewrite this as x * log_x(y) = 10. Similarly, log_x(y) is the exponent I need to raise x to get y. So, if I let log_x(y) = t, then y = x^t.

But wait, let's see. Actually, log_x(y) is the same as ln(y)/ln(x), right? So maybe it's better to express both equations in terms of natural logarithms to relate x and y.

So for the first equation, log_x(y^x) = 10.

Using the power rule, that's x * log_x(y) = 10.

Which is equivalent to x * (ln y / ln x) = 10. Let's call this equation (1).

Similarly, the second equation is log_y(x^{4y}) = 10.

Again, using the power rule: 4y * log_y(x) = 10.

And log_y(x) is the same as ln x / ln y. So substituting that in:

4y * (ln x / ln y) = 10. Let's call this equation (2).

Now, I have two equations:

1) x * (ln y / ln x) = 10

2) 4y * (ln x / ln y) = 10

Hmm, interesting. Notice that (ln y / ln x) is the reciprocal of (ln x / ln y). So if I let’s denote (ln y / ln x) as k, then equation (1) becomes x * k = 10, and equation (2) becomes 4y * (1/k) = 10.

So, we have:

x * k = 10 → equation (1a)

4y / k = 10 → equation (2a)

From equation (1a), x = 10 / k.

From equation (2a), 4y = 10k → y = (10k) / 4 = (5k)/2.

So now, I have expressions for x and y in terms of k.

x = 10 / k

y = (5k)/2

But remember that k = ln y / ln x. Let's substitute x and y in terms of k.

So, k = ln(y) / ln(x) = ln( (5k)/2 ) / ln(10 / k )

Hmm, this seems a bit complicated, but maybe we can write an equation in terms of k.

Let me write it out:

k = [ln( (5k)/2 )] / [ln(10 / k )]

Which can be rewritten as:

k * ln(10 / k) = ln( (5k)/2 )

This equation is in terms of k, and I can try solving for k.

Let me simplify this. Let's first compute ln(10 / k) and ln( (5k)/2 ).

But maybe it's better to express everything in terms of natural logarithms.

Alternatively, perhaps exponentiating both sides to eliminate the logarithms.

Let me take both sides of the equation:

k * ln(10 / k) = ln( (5k)/2 )

Let me denote A = 10 / k, so ln(A) = ln(10) - ln(k).

Similarly, the right side is ln(5k/2) = ln(5) + ln(k) - ln(2).

So substituting back, the equation becomes:

k * [ ln(10) - ln(k) ] = ln(5) + ln(k) - ln(2)

Expanding the left side:

k * ln(10) - k * ln(k) = ln(5) + ln(k) - ln(2)

Hmm, let me bring all terms to one side:

k * ln(10) - k * ln(k) - ln(5) - ln(k) + ln(2) = 0

This is getting a bit messy, but maybe I can factor some terms.

Looking at the terms with ln(k):

- k ln(k) - ln(k) = -ln(k) (k + 1)

And the other terms:

k ln(10) - ln(5) + ln(2)

So the equation becomes:

- ln(k) (k + 1) + k ln(10) - ln(5) + ln(2) = 0

Hmm. Not sure if that helps. Maybe let's consider variables substitution.

Let me let t = ln(k). Then k = e^t.

Substituting into the equation:

k ln(10) - k ln(k) - ln(5) - ln(k) + ln(2) = 0

Replace k with e^t:

e^t ln(10) - e^t * t - ln(5) - t + ln(2) = 0

Hmm, this seems even more complicated. Maybe we can factor e^t terms:

e^t (ln(10) - t) - (ln(5) + t) + ln(2) = 0

Still not helpful. Maybe there's a better approach.

Wait, perhaps instead of dealing with logarithms, I can set variables in a way that relates x and y.

From earlier, I have:

x = 10 / k

y = (5k)/2

And k = ln(y)/ln(x)

But x and y are related through k. Maybe I can find a relationship between x and y directly.

Let me try plugging x and y in terms of k into k = ln(y)/ln(x):

k = ln( (5k/2) ) / ln(10/k )

Which is the same as:

k = [ ln(5k/2) ] / [ ln(10) - ln(k) ]

Hmm, perhaps I can let u = ln(k), but not sure.

Alternatively, maybe I can set a ratio.

Let me see, perhaps let me write both equations:

From equation (1a): x = 10 / k → k = 10 / x

From equation (2a): y = (5k)/2 → y = (5*(10/x)) / 2 = (50)/(2x) = 25/x

So, y = 25 / x

So, now, I can express y in terms of x. So, y = 25/x.

But also, from the definition of k, which is log_x(y) = ln(y)/ln(x) = k.

Wait, but earlier, I found that k = 10 / x.

So, k = log_x(y) = ln(y)/ln(x) = 10/x.

But y = 25/x, so ln(y) = ln(25/x) = ln(25) - ln(x).

So, ln(y)/ln(x) = (ln(25) - ln(x)) / ln(x) = (ln(25)/ln(x)) - 1

But this equals k = 10/x.

So,

(ln(25)/ln(x)) - 1 = 10/x

Hmm, so:

ln(25)/ln(x) = 10/x + 1

Let me write this as:

ln(25)/ln(x) = (10 + x)/x

Which can be rewritten as:

ln(25)/ln(x) = (x + 10)/x

Take reciprocal of both sides:

ln(x)/ln(25) = x/(x + 10)

So,

ln(x) = [x/(x + 10)] * ln(25)

Hmm, okay, now I have an equation with x on both sides inside a logarithm and multiplied by it. Not straightforward to solve algebraically. Maybe I can let’s make a substitution.

Let me set t = x; then the equation is:

ln(t) = [t/(t + 10)] * ln(25)

I can write ln(25) as 2 ln(5), since 25 is 5 squared.

So,

ln(t) = [2 ln(5) * t ] / (t + 10 )

Hmm, this is a transcendental equation, which might not have a closed-form solution. Maybe I can find t by trial and error or look for integer solutions.

Wait, x and y are both greater than 1, and we have y =25/x. So, if x is an integer, y would be 25/x, which is also an integer if x divides 25.

Possible integer values for x are 5,25, etc. Let me test x=5.

If x=5, then y=25/5=5.

Check if x=5, y=5 satisfy the original equations.

First equation: log_5(5^5) = log_5(3125) = 5. But the equation requires it to be 10. So that doesn't work.

What about x=25?

Then y=25/25=1. But y must be greater than 1, so that's invalid.

Hmm, maybe x is 10? Then y=25/10=2.5.

Check first equation: log_10( (2.5)^10 ). Wait, wait, no: log_x(y^x) is log_10( (2.5)^10 ). Let's compute that.

log_10(2.5^10) = 10 * log_10(2.5) ≈ 10 * 0.39794 ≈ 3.979, which is not 10. So that doesn't work.

Hmm, maybe x is 2. Then y=25/2=12.5.

First equation: log_2(12.5^2) = log_2(156.25). Let's compute 2^7=128, 2^8=256. 156.25 is between 2^7 and 2^8. Let me calculate log_2(156.25). 156.25 = 25^2 / 4 = (5^2)^2 / 2^2 = 5^4 / 2^2. So, log_2(5^4 / 2^2) = log_2(5^4) - log_2(2^2) = 4 log_2(5) - 4. Since log_2(5) ≈ 2.3219, so 4*2.3219≈9.2876, minus 4 gives ≈5.2876. Not 10, so nope.

Hmm, maybe x is 1/2? But x has to be greater than 1, so no.

Alternatively, perhaps x is 25/4? Wait, let's see: y =25/x, if x is 25/4, y is 4.

So, let's test x=25/4=6.25, y=4.

First equation: log_{6.25}(4^{6.25}) = ?

Wait, let me compute that.

First, 4^{6.25} = (2^2)^{6.25} = 2^{12.5}.

So log_{6.25}(2^{12.5}).

But 6.25 is 5^2 / 2^2 = (5/2)^2.

So, log_{(5/2)^2}(2^{12.5}) = [12.5] * log_{(5/2)^2}(2) = [12.5] * [ log_{5/2}(2) / 2 ]

Because log_{a^b}(c) = (1/b) log_a(c).

So, log_{(5/2)^2}(2) = (1/2) log_{5/2}(2).

Now, log_{5/2}(2) is equal to 1 / log_2(5/2) = 1 / (log_2(5) - log_2(2)) = 1 / (log_2(5) -1).

Since log_2(5) ≈2.3219, so 2.3219 -1 =1.3219, so 1/1.3219≈0.756.

Thus, log_{(5/2)^2}(2) = (1/2)*0.756≈0.378.

So, the entire expression is 12.5 * 0.378 ≈4.725, which is not 10. So, nope.

Hmm, this trial and error might not be the best approach. Maybe I need to solve the equation:

ln(t) = [2 ln(5) * t ] / (t + 10 )

Let me write this as:

ln(t) = (2 ln(5) t) / (t + 10)

Let me denote c = 2 ln(5). So, ln(t) = c t / (t + 10)

Then, I can write:

ln(t) = c t / (t +10) → ln(t) (t + 10) = c t

So,

t ln(t) + 10 ln(t) - c t = 0

Not sure. Maybe I can make a substitution.

Let me set u = ln(t), so t = e^u. Substitute into the equation:

e^u * u + 10 u - c e^u =0

Factor e^u:

e^u (u - c) + 10 u =0

Hmm, this is still complicated.

Let me rearrange:

e^u (u - c) = -10 u

Divide both sides by e^u:

u - c = -10 u e^{-u}

So,

u +10 u e^{-u} = c

u (1 + 10 e^{-u}) = c

Hmm, not too helpful.

Alternatively, maybe define v = u, so we have:

v (1 + 10 e^{-v}) = c

But c is a constant, 2 ln(5), which is about 2*1.6094≈3.2188.

So, v (1 + 10 e^{-v}) =3.2188.

This seems like a transcendental equation. Maybe I can approximate the solution numerically.

Let me try plugging in some values for v.

Let me guess v is around 2.

v=2: 2*(1 +10 e^{-2})=2*(1 +10*(0.1353))=2*(1+1.353)=2*(2.353)=4.706>3.2188

Too big. So maybe v <2.

Try v=1:

1*(1+10 e^{-1})=1*(1 +10*(0.3679))=1*(1+3.679)=4.679>3.2188

Still too big.

v=0.5:

0.5*(1+10 e^{-0.5})=0.5*(1 +10*(0.6065))=0.5*(1+6.065)=0.5*(7.065)=3.5325>3.2188

Still too big.

v=0.4:

0.4*(1+10 e^{-0.4})=0.4*(1+10*(0.6703))=0.4*(1+6.703)=0.4*(7.703)=3.0812 <3.2188

So between v=0.4 and v=0.5.

We have at v=0.4, value=3.0812; at v=0.5, value=3.5325.

We need the value to be 3.2188, which is between 3.0812 and 3.5325.

Let me try v=0.45:

v=0.45:

0.45*(1+10 e^{-0.45})

e^{-0.45}≈0.6376

So, 10 *0.6376≈6.376

So, 1+6.376=7.376

Multiply by 0.45: 0.45 *7.376≈3.3192

Which is higher than 3.2188.

So, between v=0.4 and v=0.45.

Wait, at v=0.4, result is 3.0812, at v=0.45, it's 3.3192. We need 3.2188.

Let me try v=0.425:

v=0.425:

e^{-0.425}≈e^{-0.4}=0.6703, but more accurately, let's compute it.

0.425 is 0.4 +0.025.

e^{-0.4}=0.67032, e^{-0.025}=approx 1 -0.025 + (0.025)^2/2≈0.9756.

So, e^{-0.425}=0.67032 * 0.9756≈0.6546.

So, 10 e^{-0.425}=6.546.

1 +6.546=7.546.

Multiply by 0.425: 0.425 *7.546≈3.2069.

Close to 3.2188. So, 3.2069 is just slightly less than 3.2188.

So, let's try v=0.43.

Compute e^{-0.43}:

We know e^{-0.4}=0.67032, e^{-0.03}=approx 0.97045.

So, e^{-0.43}=e^{-0.4} * e^{-0.03} ≈0.67032 *0.97045≈0.6509.

So, 10 e^{-0.43}=6.509.

1 +6.509=7.509.

Multiply by 0.43: 0.43 *7.509≈3.2289.

Which is higher than 3.2188.

So, the value we're looking for is between v=0.425 (giving 3.2069) and v=0.43 (giving 3.2289).

We need to find v where 0.425 < v <0.43 such that 0.425*(7.546)≈3.2069 and 0.43*(7.509)=3.2289.

Wait, actually, wait, when v increases from 0.425 to 0.43, the function f(v)=v*(1 +10 e^{-v}) decreases slightly because as v increases, e^{-v} decreases, but v is increasing. Not sure exactly. Let me compute at v=0.4275.

v=0.4275:

Compute e^{-0.4275}.

Approximate: 0.4275 is 0.425 +0.0025.

We can use linear approximation for e^{-x} around x=0.425.

f(x)=e^{-x}, f'(x)=-e^{-x}.

At x=0.425, f(x)=~0.6546 (from previous step). So, f(0.4275)=f(0.425 +0.0025)≈f(0.425) +0.0025*(-e^{-0.425})=0.6546 -0.0025*0.6546≈0.6546 -0.0016365≈0.65296.

So, e^{-0.4275}≈0.65296.

So, 10 e^{-0.4275}≈6.5296.

1 +6.5296=7.5296.

Multiply by v=0.4275: 0.4275 *7.5296.

Let me compute 0.4 *7.5296=3.0118

0.0275 *7.5296≈0.2073

Total≈3.0118 +0.2073≈3.2191.

Which is very close to 3.2188.

So, v≈0.4275 gives f(v)=3.2191≈3.2188.

So, v≈0.4275.

So, u=v≈0.4275.

But u=ln(t), so t=e^{0.4275}.

Compute e^{0.4275}.

We know e^{0.4}=1.4918, e^{0.4275}= e^{0.4 +0.0275}=e^{0.4} * e^{0.0275}.

e^{0.0275}≈1 +0.0275 + (0.0275)^2/2≈1 +0.0275 +0.000378≈1.02788.

So, e^{0.4275}≈1.4918 *1.02788≈1.533.

So, t≈1.533.

But t was defined as x. Wait no, wait, t was x?

Wait, no, earlier substitution: I set t=x, but then I set u=ln(t)=ln(x). Then, in the equation, I found u≈0.4275.

So, x= e^{u}= e^{0.4275}≈1.533.

So, x≈1.533.

Then, y=25/x≈25/1.533≈16.31.

Hmm, let me verify if these approximate values satisfy the original equations.

First equation: log_x(y^x)=10.

Compute y^x = (16.31)^{1.533}.

Hmm, 16.31^1.533. Let's compute log base x of that.

x≈1.533, so log_x(a)= ln(a)/ln(x).

So, ln(y^x)=x ln(y)=1.533 * ln(16.31).

ln(16.31)=2.793.

So, x ln(y)=1.533 *2.793≈4.284.

So, log_x(y^x)=4.284 / ln(1.533).

ln(1.533)=0.4275.

So, 4.284 /0.4275≈10.02. Close enough considering the approximations.

Second equation: log_y(x^{4y})=10.

Compute x^{4y}= (1.533)^{4*16.31}= (1.533)^{65.24}.

But log_y of that is ln(x^{4y})/ln(y) =4y ln(x)/ln(y).

Which is 4*16.31 * ln(1.533)/ln(16.31).

Compute ln(1.533)=0.4275, ln(16.31)=2.793.

So, 4*16.31=65.24.

So, 65.24 *0.4275 /2.793≈65.24 *0.1528≈10.00.

Again, close enough.

So, x≈1.533, y≈16.31, so xy≈1.533*16.31≈25.

Wait, xy=25? Let me check:

x≈1.533, y≈16.31, 1.533*16.31≈25.

So, is xy exactly 25?

Wait, that's interesting because y was expressed as 25/x. So, y=25/x. So, xy= x*(25/x)=25.

So, regardless of x and y, as long as y=25/x, their product is 25.

Wait, but the problem is to find xy. So, according to this, it's 25.

But let me double-check because my approximations showed that, but maybe just algebraically, I can see that.

Wait, going back to when I had x =10/k, y=5k/2.

So, xy= (10/k)*(5k/2) )= (10*5)/(2) )=50/2=25.

Oh! So, algebraically, regardless of k, xy=25.

So, without even solving for k, we can see that xy=25.

Wow, I should have noticed that earlier.

So, the answer is 25.


To solve the problem, we start with the given equations:

1. \(\log_x(y^x) = 10\)
2. \(\log_y(x^{4y}) = 10\)

Using the logarithm power rule, we rewrite these equations:

1. \(x \cdot \log_x(y) = 10\)
2. \(4y \cdot \log_y(x) = 10\)

Let \(k = \log_x(y)\). Then, \(y = x^k\). Substituting into the second equation, we find:

\[
4y \cdot \frac{1}{k} = 10 \quad \Rightarrow \quad y = \frac{5k}{2}
\]

From the first equation, \(x \cdot k = 10\), so \(x = \frac{10}{k}\). Substituting \(x = \frac{10}{k}\) into \(y = \frac{5k}{2}\), we find:

\[
y = \frac{5k}{2} = \frac{25}{x}
\]

Thus, \(y = \frac{25}{x}\). The product \(xy\) is then:

\[
xy = x \cdot \frac{25}{x} = 25
\]

Therefore, the value of \(xy\) is \(\boxed{25}\).
