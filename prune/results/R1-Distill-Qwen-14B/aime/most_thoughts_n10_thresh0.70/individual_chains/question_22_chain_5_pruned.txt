Okay, so I have this geometry problem here about a convex equilateral hexagon. Hmm, let me try to visualize it first. An equilateral hexagon means all its sides are equal in length, right? But it's not necessarily regular because the angles might not be equal. However, it's given that all pairs of opposite sides are parallel. That's an important detail because it tells me the hexagon might have some symmetry.

The problem mentions a triangle formed by extending the sides AB, CD, and EF. These extensions form a triangle with side lengths 200, 240, and 300. I need to find the side length of the hexagon.

Let me sketch a rough diagram in my mind. So, ABCDEF is a convex hexagon. Since opposite sides are parallel, AB is parallel to DE, BC is parallel to EF, and CD is parallel to FA. Also, all sides are equal, so AB = BC = CD = DE = EF = FA = s, where s is the side length we're trying to find.

Now, the triangle formed by extending AB, CD, and EF. Let me think: when you extend AB, CD, and EF, these lines should meet at some points forming a triangle. Let me denote the triangle as PQR, where P is the intersection of AB and CD, Q is the intersection of CD and EF, and R is the intersection of EF and AB. Wait, no, maybe I should be more precise.

Actually, AB is one side, CD is another, and EF is the third. When you extend AB, CD, and EF, they each have two extensions, but the triangle is formed by the intersection points of these extended sides. So, for example, if I extend AB beyond B and A, and CD beyond C and D, their intersection might be point P. Similarly, the extension of CD beyond D and C and the extension of EF beyond E and F might meet at point Q, and the extension of EF beyond F and E and AB beyond A and B might meet at point R. So triangle PQR has sides of lengths 200, 240, 300.

Wait, but the actual lengths of these sides are given as 200, 240, 300. So, the sides of triangle PQR are 200, 240, 300. So, triangle PQR is a scaled-up version of the hexagon's sides' extensions.

I remember that in such cases, when you have a convex equilateral hexagon with opposite sides parallel, it's called a "zonogon." But I'm not entirely sure about the properties, so maybe I should think differently.

Alternatively, perhaps this is similar to a concept where the triangle formed by the extensions of the sides relates to the original hexagon through similar triangles. So, maybe the triangle PQR is similar to a smaller triangle inside, but scaled by some factor. Hmm, but I'm not sure.

Wait, let me think about the hexagon. Since it's equilateral and has opposite sides parallel, each pair of opposite sides can be considered as translations. That might mean that the hexagon can be thought of as being formed by three parallelograms or something like that.

Alternatively, perhaps I can model the
