Alright, so I have this problem about a convex equilateral hexagon. Let me try to parse it step by step.

First, the hexagon is convex and equilateral. That means all its sides are equal in length, but it's not necessarily regular because the angles might not all be equal. Also, it's given that all pairs of opposite sides are parallel. So, in a hexagon, opposite sides would be AB & DE, BC & EF, and CD & FA, I think. So each pair of opposite sides is parallel.

Then, there's a triangle formed by extending the sides AB, CD, and EF. The side lengths of this triangle are 200, 240, and 300. I need to find the side length of the hexagon.

Hmm. I remember that in such hexagons, especially when opposite sides are parallel, they can sometimes be thought of as being formed by translating sides in a certain way. Maybe this hexagon is related to a triangle through these extensions.

So, the triangle formed by extending AB, CD, and EF. Let me visualize this: if I extend AB beyond B, CD beyond D, and EF beyond F, these extensions meet to form a triangle. The sides of this triangle are 200, 240, 300.

Since the hexagon is convex, the extensions of AB, CD, EF must meet in such a way that they form a triangle outside the hexagon.

I think this setup might have something to do with similar triangles or perhaps using the concept of similar triangles to relate the sides of the hexagon to the sides of the triangle.

Wait, I remember that in a convex equilateral hexagon with opposite sides parallel, the triangle formed by the extensions of its sides can be used to find the side length using some proportional relationships.

Let me try to recall the formula or method. I think the side length 's' of the hexagon can be found using the formula involving the sides of the triangle and maybe the area or something else.

Alternatively, maybe I can model the hexagon as being a part of the triangle, with the triangle's sides being the extensions. So, the hexagon is sort of "cut out" from the triangle, with each side of the hexagon being a segment that's parallel to the corresponding sides of the triangle.

Wait, that sounds familiar. If each pair of opposite sides of the hexagon is
