Okay, so I've got this problem here. Let me try to parse it out. There are four points A, B, C, D on the hyperbola given by the equation x²/20 - y²/24 = 1. These four points form a rhombus ABCD, and the diagonals of this rhombus intersect at the origin. The question is asking for the greatest real number that is less than BD² for all such rhombi. So, I need to find the infimum of BD², or the maximum lower bound for BD². 

First, let me recall some properties of rhombuses. In a rhombus, all sides are equal in length, and the diagonals bisect each other at right angles. Wait, no, actually, only that the diagonals bisect each other, but they are not necessarily perpendicular unless it's a square. Wait, no, actually, in a rhombus, the diagonals are not necessarily perpendicular. Wait, no, hold on. Wait, no, in a rhombus, the diagonals are perpendicular. Yes, that's right. Because in a rhombus, which is a special kind of parallelogram, the diagonals are perpendicular bisectors of each other. So, they intersect at right angles.

Given that the diagonals intersect at the origin, the origin is the midpoint of both diagonals. So, points A and C are endpoints of one diagonal, and points B and D are endpoints of the other. Since the diagonals bisect each other at the origin, if A is (x, y), then C is (-x, -y), and similarly, if B is (u, v), then D is (-u, -v). 

Now, since ABCD is a rhombus, all sides must be equal. So, the distance from A to B should be equal to the distance from B to C, and so on. Alternatively, since the diagonals are perpendicular, the sides can be expressed in terms of the half-diagonals. Wait, actually, in a rhombus, the area is (d1 * d2)/2, where d1 and d2 are the lengths of the diagonals. Also, the side length s can be expressed in terms of the diagonals as s = sqrt((d1/2)² + (d2/2)²). 

But maybe it's easier to start by considering the coordinates of the points. Let me denote the points as follows: Let point A be (x, y), then point C is (-x, -y). Let point B be (u, v), then point D is (-u, -v). 

Since ABCD is a rhombus, the sides AB, BC, CD, DA must all be equal in length. Let me write that out. The distance between A and B should equal the distance between B and C. 

So, distance AB: sqrt[(u - x)^2 + (v - y)^2]
Distance BC: sqrt[( -x - u)^2 + (-y - v)^2]

Setting these equal:

sqrt[(u - x)^2 + (v - y)^2] = sqrt[(-x - u)^2 + (-y - v)^2]

Square both sides:

(u - x)^2 + (v - y)^2 = (-x - u)^2 + (-y - v)^2

Expanding both sides:

Left side: u² - 2ux + x² + v² - 2vy + y²
Right side: x² + 2ux + u² + y² + 2vy + v²

Set them equal:

u² - 2ux + x² + v² - 2vy + y² = x² + 2ux + u² + y² + 2vy + v²

Subtract right side from both sides:

-2ux -2vy - (2ux + 2vy) = 0

Wait, actually, subtracting right side from left side:

(u² - 2ux + x² + v² - 2vy + y²) - (x² + 2ux + u² + y² + 2vy + v²) = 0

Simplify term by term:

u² - u² = 0
-2ux - 2ux = -4ux
x² - x² = 0
v² - v² = 0
-2vy - 2vy = -4vy
y² - y² = 0

So, combining: -4ux -4vy = 0 → -4ux -4vy = 0 → Divide both sides by -4: ux + vy = 0.

So, equation: ux + vy = 0. 

That's one equation. Now, since points A, B, C, D lie on the hyperbola x²/20 - y²/24 = 1. So, substituting A: x²/20 - y²/24 = 1, similarly for B: u²/20 - v²/24 = 1.

So, we have two points on the hyperbola: (x, y) and (u, v). 

Also, because ABCD is a rhombus, the sides must be equal. So, perhaps another condition comes from the slopes of the sides? Or maybe the fact that the diagonals are perpendicular, which is true for a rhombus. 

Wait, but in a rhombus, the diagonals are perpendicular. So, the product of their slopes is -1. Let me think. The diagonals are AC and BD. So, the slope of AC is ( -y - y ) / ( -x - x ) = (-2y)/(-2x) =
