Okay, so I have this problem about a convex equilateral hexagon where all pairs of opposite sides are parallel. The triangle formed by extending AB, CD, and EF has sides of lengths 200, 240, and 300. I need to find the side length of the hexagon.

Hmm, okay, let's break this down. First, I know that in a convex hexagon, all interior angles are less than 180 degrees, and the sides don't cross each other. It's equilateral, so all sides are equal in length, but it's not necessarily regular because the angles can vary. However, all pairs of opposite sides are parallel. That seems important.

So, in a hexagon, opposite sides would be AB & DE, BC & EF, and CD & FA. Wait, no, actually, in a hexagon, each side has one opposite side. Let me think: in a regular hexagon, each side is opposite another, but since this is convex and equilateral with opposite sides parallel, it's similar in structure but not necessarily regular.

The triangle formed by extending AB, CD, and EF has sides 200, 240, 300. So, these are the lengths of the sides of this triangle. I need to relate this triangle to the hexagon.

I think I should visualize this. Let me imagine the hexagon ABCDEF, with AB, BC, CD, DE, EF, FA as consecutive sides. Since opposite sides are parallel, AB is parallel to DE, BC is parallel to EF, and CD is parallel to FA.

Now, when we extend AB, CD, and EF, they form a triangle. So, these three extended lines intersect to form a triangle with sides 200, 240, 300. Let me label the triangle as triangle XYZ, where XY=200, YZ=240, XZ=300.

Wait, but how exactly are AB, CD, and EF related to this triangle? Let me try to sketch this mentally. If I extend AB, CD, and EF, they meet at points forming triangle XYZ. So, each of these sides is extended beyond their original endpoints to meet at the triangle's vertices.

I think each extended side corresponds to a side of the triangle. So, AB is extended beyond A and B to meet CD extended beyond C and D, and EF extended beyond E and F. Hmm, not entirely sure, but maybe.

Since all opposite sides are parallel, perhaps the hexagon can be thought of as being 'inscribed' within the triangle, with each pair of opposite sides cutting off a smaller, similar triangle from the original triangle XYZ.

Wait, that might make sense. If we have a large triangle XYZ and inside it, the hexagon is such that each pair of opposite sides is parallel to the sides of XYZ. So, extending AB, CD, EF would reach the sides of XYZ.

Alternatively, maybe the hexagon is formed by three smaller similar triangles cut off from XYZ by lines parallel to the sides.

Wait, that might be a good approach. Let me consider that.

Suppose that triangle XYZ has sides 200, 240, 300. Let me check if this is a right triangle. Let
