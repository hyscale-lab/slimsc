Okay, so I need to solve this geometry problem. Let me read it again to make sure I understand all the parts.

We have triangle ABC with circumcenter O and incenter I. It says that IA is perpendicular to OI. The circumradius is given as 13, and the inradius is 6. We need to find the product AB multiplied by AC, which is AB·AC.

Hmm, okay, so let me recall some properties of triangle centers and inradius and circumradius.

First, the circumradius R is 13, so that's the radius of the circumscribed circle. The inradius r is 6, which is the radius of the inscribed circle.

The incenter I is the point where the angle bisectors meet, and it's equidistant from all sides. The circumcenter O is the point where the perpendicular bisectors meet, and it's equidistant from all vertices, which is the circumradius R.

Given that IA is perpendicular to OI, this seems like a key piece of information. So, the line from I to A is perpendicular to the line from O to I. That must form some right angle there.

I think I should try to visualize the triangle ABC with points O and I. Maybe drawing a diagram would help, but since I can't do that here, I'll have to imagine it.

I remember that in any triangle, the distance between the incenter and circumcenter can be calculated using the formula:

OI² = R(R - 2r)

Where OI is the distance between the circumcenter and incenter, R is the circumradius, and r is the inradius.

So, plugging in the values we have:

OI² = 13(13 - 2*6) = 13(13 -12) = 13*1 =13

So, OI = sqrt(13). 

But wait, does this formula always hold? Hmm, I think it's a standard formula, so I should be okay.

Now, since IA is perpendicular to OI, triangle IOA is a right-angled triangle at I. So, in triangle IOA, OA is the hypotenuse, which is the same as the circumradius, so OA = R =13.

The legs are IO and IA, with IO being sqrt(13), and IA being the length from inradius I to vertex A.

Wait, IA isn't necessarily the inradius. The inradius is the distance from I to any side, but IA is the distance from I to vertex A. So, IA is something else.

In triangle IOA, right-angled at I, we can apply Pythagoras:

OA² = IO² + IA²

We know OA is 13, IO is sqrt(13), so:

13² = (sqrt(13))² + IA²
169 = 13 + IA²
IA² = 169 -13 =156
So, IA = sqrt(156) = sqrt(4*39) = 2*sqrt(39)

So, IA is 2√39.

Now, I need to relate IA to something else in the triangle. Maybe there's a formula that relates the distance from the inradius to a vertex with other triangle parameters.

I recall that in a triangle, the distance from the incenter to a vertex can be expressed in terms of the triangle's sides and angles.

Let me think. The coordinates of incenter I can be expressed in terms of the sides, but maybe that's complicating things.

Alternatively, I know that in triangle ABC, the distance from I to A can be expressed using the formula:

IA = \frac{r}{\sin \frac{A}{2}}

Where r is the inradius and A is the angle at vertex A.

Wait, is that correct? Let me check.

Yes, I think that's a standard formula. The distance from the incenter to vertex A is IA = r / sin(A/2). Similarly for IB and IC.

So, if IA = 2√39, and r =6, then:
