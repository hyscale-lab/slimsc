Okay, so I've got this tetrahedron problem to solve. The tetrahedron is labeled ABCD, and each pair of opposite edges has the same lengths. Specifically, AB and CD are both √41, AC and BD are both √80, and BC and AD are both √89. I need to find the distance from the incenter (the point equidistant from all faces) to each face, and express it in a specific form. Alright, let me start by visualizing the problem.

First, tetrahedrons can be tricky because they're three-dimensional, but the symmetry in the edge lengths might help. Since opposite edges are equal, this suggests the tetrahedron is "isohedral" or maybe "equifacial," but I'm not sure. Wait, no, isohedral means that all faces are the same, which isn't necessarily the case here. Maybe it's a kind of symmetrical tetrahedron where opposite edges are equal, which might make calculations easier.

I remember that in a tetrahedron, the inradius (the radius of the inscribed sphere touching all faces) can be found using the formula:

r = 3V / S

where V is the volume of the tetrahedron and S is the total surface area. So, first, I need to find the volume V and the total surface area S.

To find the volume, I can use the Cayley-Menger determinant, which is a formula that gives the volume of a tetrahedron given the lengths of all its edges. That seems promising because I have all the edge lengths. Let me recall the formula. The Cayley-Menger determinant for a tetrahedron with edge lengths AB = a, AC = b, AD = c, BC = d, BD = e, CD = f is given by:

Volume = sqrt( |CM| / 288 )

where CM is the determinant of the following matrix:

| 0   1    1    1    1  |
| 1   0   a²   b²   c² |
| 1   a²   0    d²   e² |
| 1   b²  d²   0    f² |
| 1   c²  e²   f²   0  |

So, let me assign the given lengths to the respective variables:

AB = √41 => a = √41
AC = √80 => b = √80
AD = √89 => c = √89
BC = √89 => d = √89
BD = √80 => e = √80
CD = √41 => f = √41

Wait, let me confirm:

AB = CD = √41, so AB is a, CD is f, so a=√41, f=√41.

AC = BD = √80, so AC is b, BD is e, so b=√80, e=√80.

AD = BC = √89, so AD is c, BC is d, so c=√89, d=√89.

Okay, so plugging in the squares:

a² = 41, b²=80, c²=89, d²=89, e²=80, f²=41.

Now I can set up the Cayley-Menger determinant matrix:

Row 0: 0, 1, 1, 1, 1

Row 1: 1, 0, 41, 80, 89

Row 2: 1, 41, 0, 89, 80

Row 3: 1, 80, 89, 0, 41

Row 4: 1, 89, 80, 41, 0

Wait, is this correct? Let me double-check the positions. The matrix is 5x5, with the first row and column being 0,1,1,1,1 and the first element of each subsequent row is 1, followed by the squared distances.

Yes, so:

Row 0: 0, 1, 1, 1, 1

Row 1: 1, 0, AB², AC², AD² => 1,0,41,80,89

Row 2: 1, AB², 0, BC², BD² => 1,41,0,89,80

Row 3: 1, AC², BC², 0, CD² => 1,80,89,0,41

Row 4: 1, AD², BD², CD², 0 => 1,89,80,41,0

Yes, that seems correct.

Now, the determinant of this matrix will be |CM|. Let me write this matrix clearly:

CM = [
[0, 1, 1, 1, 1],
[1, 0, 41, 80, 89],
[1, 41, 0, 89, 80],
[1, 80, 89, 0, 41],
[1, 89, 80, 41, 0]
]

Calculating a 5x5 determinant is going to be a bit tedious, but perhaps there's some symmetry I can exploit. Let me see the pattern of the matrix. 

Looking at the matrix, it's symmetric across the main diagonal. That might help in simplifying the determinant.

Alternatively, maybe I can perform row or column operations to simplify it before expanding. Let me consider subtracting the first row from the others. That often reduces the number of non-zero elements.

Let me denote the rows as R0, R1, R2, R3, R4.

Subtract R0 from R1, R2, R3, R4:

R1' = R1 - R0: [1-0, 0-1, 41-1, 80-1, 89-1] = [1, -1, 40, 79, 88]

Similarly,

R2' = R2 - R0: [1-0, 41-1, 0-1, 89-1, 80-1] = [1, 40, -1, 88, 79]

R3' = R3 - R0: [1-0, 80-1, 89-1, 0-1, 41-1] = [1, 79, 88, -1, 40]

R4' = R4 - R0: [1-0, 89-1, 80-1, 41-1, 0-1] = [1, 88, 79, 40, -1]

So the transformed matrix becomes:

Row 0: 0, 1, 1, 1, 1

Row 1: 1, -1, 40, 79, 88

Row 2: 1, 40, -1, 88, 79

Row 3: 1, 79, 88, -1, 40

Row 4: 1, 88, 79, 40, -1

Now, looking at this transformed matrix, I can try expanding the determinant. However, since the first column has a 0 in the first row, maybe expanding along the first column is better.

The determinant of a matrix can be calculated by expanding along any row or column. Since the first column has a 0 in the first position (R0C0), the expansion might be manageable.

The determinant formula when expanding along the first column is:

det(CM) = 0 * M00 - 1 * M10 + 1 * M20 - 1 * M30 + 1 * M40

But since the first term is 0, we can ignore it.

So,

det(CM) = -1 * M10 + 1 * M20 - 1 * M30 + 1 * M40

Where Mij is the minor of element (i,j), which is the determinant of the submatrix obtained by removing row i and column j.

So, let's find each minor:

M10: Remove row 1 and column 0.

The submatrix is:

Row 0: [1, 1, 1, 1]

Row 2: [40, -1, 88, 79]

Row 3: [79, 88, -1, 40]

Row 4: [88, 79, 40, -1]

Wait, no, wait. Wait, when we remove row 1 and column 0, the remaining rows are R0, R2, R3, R4, and the columns are C1, C2, C3, C4.

So M10 is the determinant of:

[
[1, 1, 1, 1],
[40, -1, 88, 79],
[79, 88, -1, 40],
[88, 79, 40, -1]
]

Similarly, M20: Remove row 2 and column 0.

Submatrix:

Row 0: [1, 1, 1, 1]

Row 1: [ -1, 40, 79, 88 ]

Row 3: [79, 88, -1, 40]

Row 4: [88, 79, 40, -1]

Similarly for M30 and M40.

Hmm, this is getting complicated. Maybe I should compute each minor separately.

Let me compute M10 first.

M10 is the determinant of:

[
[1, 1, 1, 1],
[40, -1, 88, 79],
[79, 88, -1, 40],
[88, 79, 40, -1]
]

This is a 4x4 determinant. Calculating this directly would be time-consuming, but perhaps there's a pattern or symmetry.

Looking at the last three rows, each has a similar structure but permuted. Maybe if I perform some row operations to simplify.

Let me subtract the first row from the other rows.

New rows:

Row2' = Row2 - Row1: [40-1, -1-1, 88-1, 79-1] → [39, -2, 87, 78]

Row3' = Row3 - Row1: [79-1, 88-1, -1-1, 40-1] → [78, 87, -2, 39]

Row4' = Row4 - Row1: [88-1, 79-1, 40-1, -1-1] → [87, 78, 39, -2]

So the transformed M10 matrix is:

Row0: [1, 1, 1, 1]

Row1: [39, -2, 87, 78]

Row2: [78, 87, -2, 39]

Row3: [87, 78, 39, -2]

Hmm, interesting. Now, the lower three rows seem to be cyclic permutations of each other. Maybe I can factor out common factors or use some properties.

Alternatively, maybe I can compute the determinant now. Let me try expanding along the first row.

The determinant of M10 is:

1 * det(minor) - 1 * det(minor) + 1 * det(minor) - 1 * det(minor)

Wait, expanding a 4x4 is going to be tedious. Maybe it's better to use the fact that the lower three rows have a cyclic pattern.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use row operations to make zeros. For example, adding all three rows together.

Let me try adding Row1, Row2, Row3:

Row1 + Row2 + Row3:

39 +78 +87 = 204

-2 +87 + (-2) = 83

87 + (-2) +39 = 124

78 +39 + (-2) = 115

So, the sum is [204, 83, 124, 115]

But I'm not sure if that helps. Alternatively, perhaps there's a pattern in the minors.

Wait, perhaps I should compute M10 using cofactor expansion. Let me pick the first column of M10.

The first column is [1, 39, 78, 87].

So, the determinant M10 can be expanded as:

1 * det(minor) - 39 * det(minor) + 78 * det(minor) - 87 * det(minor)

Wait, but this seems like a lot of work. Maybe I should try a different approach.

Alternatively, perhaps I can observe that the given tetrahedron is a special case where all opposite edges are equal, which might imply that it's a disphenoid. A disphenoid is a tetrahedron where opposite edges are equal, and the four faces are congruent triangles. If that's the case, then all faces are congruent, which might make computing the volume and surface area easier.

Wait, wait, if it's a disphenoid, then all faces are congruent triangles. Let me check if the given edge lengths allow for that.

Each face is a triangle with sides:

Face ABC: AB=√41, AC=√80, BC=√89

Face ABD: AB=√41, AD=√89, BD=√80

Face ACD: AC=√80, AD=√89, CD=√41

Face BCD: BC=√89, BD=√80, CD=√41

So each face is a triangle with sides √41, √80, √89. So yes, all four faces are congruent triangles. Therefore, this is a disphenoid, which has some nice properties.

In a disphenoid, the volume can be computed using a simpler formula. I recall that for a disphenoid, the volume is given by:

V = (4/3) * sqrt( (a² + b² - c²)(a² + c² - b²)(b² + c² - a²) ) / 8

Wait, maybe I need to find another formula. Alternatively, the volume can be computed using the formula for a tetrahedron with congruent faces.

Alternatively, since all faces are congruent, perhaps the volume can be found using Heron's formula for one face and then relating it to the height.

Wait, let me try that.

First, compute the area of one face. Let's consider triangle ABC with sides AB=√41, AC=√80, BC=√89.

Compute the semi-perimeter, s:

s = (√41 + √80 + √89)/2

But maybe instead of dealing with square roots, I can square the sides and use Heron's formula with squared terms.

Wait, Heron's formula is:

Area = sqrt( s(s - a)(s - b)(s - c) )

But with the sides involving square roots, this might get messy. Alternatively, maybe I can compute the area squared.

Let me denote:

a = √41, b = √80, c = √89

Compute s = (a + b + c)/2

But perhaps it's easier to compute (s - a)(s - b)(s - c) s.

Alternatively, since all faces are congruent, maybe I can find the volume using another method.

Wait, perhaps I can compute the volume using the formula for a disphenoid. I think the volume of a disphenoid is given by:

V = (sqrt( (a² + b² - c²)(a² + c² - b²)(b² + c² - a²) )) / 72

Wait, I'm not sure about the exact formula. Maybe I should look for an alternative approach.

Alternatively, since the tetrahedron is a disphenoid, it can be embedded in a rectangular box. The formula for such a tetrahedron's volume is (4/3) times the volume of the box, but I'm getting a bit confused.

Wait, another approach: Since all faces are congruent triangles, the tetrahedron is isohedral, so the inradius can be related to the volume and the surface area.

Wait, but I still need the volume and the surface area.

Wait, perhaps I can compute the volume using the Cayley-Menger determinant as I started earlier, even though it's a bit tedious.

So, going back to the determinant. Since computing M10 is getting complicated, perhaps I can look for a pattern or symmetry.

Wait, noticing that the transformed matrix after row operations is symmetric across rows 1, 2, 3, 4. Each of the rows beyond the first has a similar structure, just permuted.

Alternatively, maybe I can swap rows to make the matrix look more manageable. For example, swapping rows 2 and 3, or something like that.

Alternatively, perhaps I can compute the determinant using a computational tool, but since I'm doing this manually, let's try an alternative approach.

Wait, maybe I can consider that the determinant of a matrix with such symmetry can be factored or have some eigenvalues that make it easier.

Alternatively, perhaps I can compute the determinant by expanding along a different row or column.

Wait, let's try a different approach. Since all the face areas are equal, maybe I can compute the volume in another way.

Each face has sides √41, √80, √89. Let me compute the area of one face using Heron's formula.

Compute semi-perimeter s:

s = (√41 + √80 + √89)/2

Compute s - a = (√41 + √80 + √89)/2 - √41 = (-√41 + √80 + √89)/2

Similarly, s - b = (√41 - √80 + √89)/2

s - c = (√41 + √80 - √89)/2

So, the product s(s - a)(s - b)(s - c) is:

[ (sqrt41 + sqrt80 + sqrt89)/2 ] * [ (-sqrt41 + sqrt80 + sqrt89)/2 ] * [ (sqrt41 - sqrt80 + sqrt89)/2 ] * [ (sqrt41 + sqrt80 - sqrt89)/2 ]

This looks complicated, but perhaps we can pair the terms.

Notice that:

[ (sqrt41 + sqrt80 + sqrt89)/2 ] * [ (-sqrt41 + sqrt80 + sqrt89)/2 ] = [ (sqrt80 + sqrt89)^2 - (sqrt41)^2 ] / 4

Similarly, [ (sqrt41 - sqrt80 + sqrt89)/2 ] * [ (sqrt41 + sqrt80 - sqrt89)/2 ] = [ (sqrt41)^2 - (sqrt80 - sqrt89)^2 ] / 4

Let me compute each pair:

First pair:

Numerator: (sqrt80 + sqrt89)^2 - 41

= (80 + 89 + 2*sqrt(80*89)) - 41

= (169 + 2*sqrt(7120)) -41

= 128 + 2*sqrt(7120)

Simplify sqrt(7120):

7120 = 16 * 445 = 16 * 5 * 89

So sqrt(7120) = 4*sqrt(445) = 4*sqrt(5*89). Since 5 and 89 are primes, that's the simplest.

So first pair numerator: 128 + 2*4*sqrt(5*89) = 128 + 8 sqrt(445)

Denominator: 4

So first pair: (128 + 8 sqrt(445)) / 4 = 32 + 2 sqrt(445)

Second pair:

(sqrt41)^2 - (sqrt80 - sqrt89)^2 = 41 - [80 + 89 - 2*sqrt(80*89)]

= 41 - 169 + 2 sqrt(7120)

= -128 + 2*4 sqrt(5*89) = -128 + 8 sqrt(445)

Denominator: 4

So second pair: (-128 + 8 sqrt(445)) / 4 = -32 + 2 sqrt(445)

Now, the product of the two pairs:

(32 + 2 sqrt(445)) * (-32 + 2 sqrt(445)) = (2 sqrt(445))^2 - (32)^2

= 4*445 - 1024

= 1780 - 1024 = 756

So, the product s(s - a)(s - b)(s - c) is 756 / (4*4) = 756 / 16 = 189 / 4.

Wait, wait, let me retrace.

Wait, no, the first two pairs were each divided by 4, so when multiplied together, the denominator is 4 * 4 = 16.

So,

[s(s - a)(s - b)(s - c)] = [ (first pair) * (second pair) ] = [ (32 + 2 sqrt(445)) * (-32 + 2 sqrt(445)) ] / (4*4)

Which we found is 756 / 16.

So,

Area^2 = s(s - a)(s - b)(s - c) = 756 / 16

Thus, Area = sqrt(756/16) = sqrt(756)/4.

Simplify sqrt(756):

756 = 4 * 189 = 4 * 9 * 21 = 4 * 9 * 3 * 7.

So sqrt(756) = 2 * 3 * sqrt(21) = 6 sqrt(21)

Thus, Area = (6 sqrt(21)) / 4 = (3 sqrt(21)) / 2.

So each face has area (3 sqrt(21))/2.

Since there are four faces, the total surface area S = 4 * (3 sqrt(21))/2 = 6 sqrt(21).

Wait, hold on. Wait, each face is congruent, so total surface area is 4 times the area of one face. So:

S = 4 * (3 sqrt(21)/2) = 6 sqrt(21). Got it.

Now, I need the volume V of the tetrahedron. I can either go back to the Cayley-Menger determinant or find another way.

Wait, maybe there's a formula for the volume of a disphenoid. Since all faces are congruent, perhaps the volume can be found using edge lengths and the face areas.

Alternatively, since I have the face areas, maybe I can find the volume using the formula:

Volume = (4/3) * (Area of face) * (distance from inradius)

Wait, but that's the formula involving the inradius, which is what I'm trying to find. Hmm, perhaps not helpful.

Wait, alternatively, maybe I can use the formula for the volume of a tetrahedron in terms of the areas of the faces and the dihedral angles, but that might not be straightforward.

Wait, maybe I can compute the volume using the formula for a disphenoid. I found that for a disphenoid, the volume can be calculated as:

V = sqrt( (a² + b² - c²)(a² + c² - b²)(b² + c² - a²) ) / 72

Wait, but I need to confirm this formula. Alternatively, I might have gotten it wrong.

Wait, let me think. For a tetrahedron with congruent faces, maybe the volume can be expressed in terms of the edge lengths.

Alternatively, perhaps use the Cayley-Menger determinant. Let me try that.

So, going back, the determinant of the Cayley-Menger matrix is |CM|, and the volume is sqrt( |CM| / 288 ). But computing |CM| is the main challenge.

Wait, perhaps I can exploit the symmetry in the matrix. Since the tetrahedron is a disphenoid, the Cayley-Menger determinant might have some properties.

Alternatively, since all opposite edges are equal, perhaps the determinant simplifies.

Wait, in the Cayley-Menger matrix, the first row is [0,1,1,1,1], and the following rows have a symmetric pattern.

Wait, perhaps I can compute the determinant using properties of symmetric matrices or eigenvalues, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe I can use the fact that the volume is related to the edge lengths.

Wait, another approach: Since all faces are congruent triangles, and the tetrahedron is a disphenoid, maybe I can compute the volume using the formula:

V = (4/3) * area of face * inradius.

Wait, no, that's the formula for the volume in terms of the inradius and the surface area. Wait, Volume = (1/3) * surface area * inradius.

Wait, actually, no. Wait, for a polyhedron, the volume is equal to (1/3) times the surface area times the inradius, but only for regular polyhedrons, I think. Wait, no, that's not correct. Wait, the volume of a regular pyramid is (1/3) * base area * height, but for a general tetrahedron, it's (1/3) times the base area times the height from the apex. However, in the case of an inscribed sphere, the distance from the incenter to each face is the inradius r, and the volume can be expressed as (1/3) * r * S, where S is the total surface area. So, V = (1/3) * r * S.

Wait, that seems correct. So, V = (1/3) * r * S, which rearranges to r = 3V / S.

So, if I can compute V, then I can find r.

But first, I need V.

Alternatively, maybe I can find V using the formula for a disphenoid. Let me check.

Upon some quick research in my mind, I recall that for a disphenoid, the volume can be expressed as:

V = (sqrt( (a² + b² - c²)(a² + c² - b²)(b² + c² - a²) )) / 72

Wait, but I'm not entirely sure if this is correct. Let me test this formula with known values.

Wait, if a, b, c are the edges of the disphenoid, but in our case, the disphenoid has opposite edges equal, so a = CD = √41, b = BD = √80, c = BC = √89.

Wait, no, the formula might require different edge lengths. Alternatively, perhaps it's better to proceed with the Cayley-Menger determinant.

Wait, maybe I can compute the determinant numerically, but since I need an exact value, perhaps I can find a pattern.

Wait, let me look at the transformed Cayley-Menger matrix after the row operations:

Row0: 0, 1, 1, 1, 1

Row1: 1, -1, 40, 79, 88

Row2: 1, 40, -1, 88, 79

Row3: 1, 79, 88, -1, 40

Row4: 1, 88, 79, 40, -1

Hmm, each of the rows from 1 to 4 has a similar structure, just permuted.

So, perhaps the determinant can be expressed as a combination of these symmetries.

Alternatively, perhaps I can notice that the sum of the last four rows (excluding the first element) is [ (-1 +40 +79 +88), (40 -1 +88 +79), (79 +88 -1 +40), (88 +79 +40 -1) ].

Wait, let me compute each element:

First column (excluding R0C0): 1,1,1,1.

Other elements in row1: -1,40,79,88

Sum of row1 (excluding first element): (-1 +40 +79 +88) = 206

Similarly, row2: 40, -1,88,79 → sum: 40 + (-1) +88 +79 = 206

Similarly, row3:79,88,-1,40 → sum: 79+88+(-1)+40=206

Row4:88,79,40,-1 → sum: 88+79+40+(-1)=206

So, each row from 1 to 4 has a sum of 206 in their last four elements.

Wait, that's interesting. Maybe I can perform a row operation where I subtract the sum of rows 1-4 to create zeros.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps I can factor out 206 from the rows.

Wait, perhaps I can factor out 206, but it's not clear.

Alternatively, perhaps I can perform the following operation: Add all four rows (1-4) together.

This would give a new row where each element (excluding the first) is 206. So, the new row would be [4, 206, 206, 206, 206]. But I don't know if that helps.

Alternatively, perhaps I can subtract the first row from the others.

Wait, I think I'm going in circles here. Maybe I should proceed with computing the determinant step by step.

So, det(CM) = -1 * M10 + 1 * M20 -1 * M30 +1 * M40

Each minor Mij is the determinant of a 4x4 matrix. Let me compute M10, M20, M30, M40.

But that's a lot. Maybe I can notice that M10, M20, M30, M40 are all similar due to the symmetry, so perhaps their determinants are equal or have some relation.

Wait, looking back, after row operations, the transformed CM matrix is symmetric. So, the minors M10, M20, M30, M40 should all be equal. Let me check:

M10 is the determinant after removing row1 and column0.

M20 is after removing row2 and column0.

But due to the symmetry, the minors should have the same determinant.

So, det(M10) = det(M20) = det(M30) = det(M40).

Therefore, det(CM) = -1*M10 + 1*M20 -1*M30 +1*M40 = (-1 +1 -1 +1) * det(M10) = 0. Wait, that can't be right because the determinant can't be zero for a non-degenerate tetrahedron.

Hmm, that suggests an error in my reasoning. Wait, perhaps the minors are not all equal because the signs alternate in the cofactor expansion.

Wait, in the cofactor expansion, the sign for each term is (-1)^(i+j). So, for M10, it's (-1)^(1+0) = -1, M20 is (-1)^(2+0) = +1, M30 is (-1)^(3+0) = -1, M40 is (-1)^(4+0) = +1.

So, when I have det(CM) = -M10 + M20 - M30 + M40, if all minors are equal, then det(CM) = (-1 +1 -1 +1) * M = 0 * M = 0, which can't be.

But that contradicts the fact that the tetrahedron is non-degenerate. So, perhaps my assumption that all minors are equal is incorrect.

Wait, perhaps due to the symmetric nature, the minors are not all equal. Maybe each minor has a different value.

But that complicates things. Alternatively, perhaps I can compute M10 and see.

Wait, going back, M10 is the determinant of:

[
[1, 1, 1, 1],
[40, -1, 88, 79],
[79, 88, -1, 40],
[88, 79, 40, -1]
]

Let me denote this as M10.

I can try expanding this determinant. Let's expand along the first row.

det(M10) = 1 * det([[-1,88,79],[88,-1,40],[79,40,-1]]) 
          -1 * det([[40,88,79],[79,-1,40],[88,40,-1]])
          +1 * det([[40,-1,79],[79,88,40],[88,79,-1]])
          -1 * det([[40,-1,88],[79,88,-1],[88,79,40]])

Hmm, this is getting really complicated. Maybe I can notice that each of these 3x3 determinants has a pattern. Let me compute one of them as an example.

Compute the first minor: det([[-1,88,79],[88,-1,40],[79,40,-1]])

Compute this determinant.

Using the rule of Sarrus or cofactor expansion.

Let me expand along the first row:

-1 * det([[-1,40],[40,-1]]) 
- 88 * det([[88,40],[79,-1]])
+79 * det([[88,-1],[79,40]])

Compute each:

First term: -1 * [ (-1)(-1) - (40)(40) ] = -1*(1 - 1600) = -1*(-1599) = 1599

Second term: -88 * [ (88)(-1) - (40)(79) ] = -88*(-88 - 3160) = -88*(-3248) = 88 * 3248

Wait, let me compute 88 * 3248:

But perhaps that's too big. Let me see:

88 * 3248 = (80 +8) * 3248 = 80*3248 +8*3248

80*3248 = 259,840

8*3248 = 25,984

Total: 259,840 +25,984 = 285,824

But because of the negative sign: -88 * (something negative) = positive 285,824.

Third term: 79 * [ (88)(40) - (-1)(79) ] = 79*(3520 +79) = 79*3599

Compute 79*3599:

3599 = 3600 -1

So, 79*3600 = 284,400

Minus 79*1 = 79

So, 284,400 -79 = 284,321

So, total determinant is:

1599 + 285,824 + 284,321

Add 1599 + 285,824 = 287,423

287,423 + 284,321 = 571,744

So, the first minor is 571,744.

Wait, that's a big number. Let me see if the other minors have similar values.

But this is getting too time-consuming. Maybe I need a smarter approach.

Wait, perhaps I can notice that the matrix M10 is symmetric in some way, leading to its determinant being zero. But in this case, it's not zero, as the face area isn't zero.

Wait, maybe I can consider that the matrix M10 has eigenvalues that can be found easily, but without computational tools, that's difficult.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use the fact that the Cayley-Menger determinant for a disphenoid can be simplified.

Wait, after some research in my mind, I found that for a disphenoid, the Cayley-Menger determinant can be expressed as:

CM = 288 * V^2 = ... ?

Wait, maybe I can find another formula. Alternatively, perhaps I can compute the volume using the formula for a tetrahedron with congruent faces.

Wait, since all faces are congruent triangles, perhaps the tetrahedron can be inscribed in a sphere, but that might not help directly.

Wait, perhaps I can compute the volume using the formula involving the product of edge lengths.

Alternatively, I can try to find the volume using the following approach: Since all faces are congruent, and the tetrahedron is a disphenoid, the volume can be found using the formula:

V = (4/3) * sqrt( (a² + b² - c²)(a² + c² - b²)(b² + c² - a²) ) / 8

Wait, where a, b, c are the lengths of the edges of the face triangle. Let me test this with our values.

Given a triangle with sides √41, √80, √89.

Compute:

a = √41, b = √80, c = √89

Compute (a² + b² - c²) = 41 +80 -89 = 32

(a² + c² - b²) =41 +89 -80 =50

(b² + c² - a²)=80 +89 -41=128

So, the product is 32 *50 *128 = 32*50=1600; 1600*128=204,800

So, V = (4/3) * sqrt(204800) /8

Wait, sqrt(204800) = sqrt(2048 * 100) = 10 * sqrt(2048)

2048 = 1024 *2 = 32² *2, so sqrt(2048)=32 sqrt(2)

Thus, sqrt(204800)=10*32 sqrt(2)=320 sqrt(2)

So,

V = (4/3) * (320 sqrt(2)) /8 = (4/3) *40 sqrt(2)= (160/3) sqrt(2)

Wait, but is this correct? I'm not sure. Let me check the formula again.

Wait, I think the formula is V = (4/3) * sqrt( (a² + b² - c²)(a² + c² - b²)(b² + c² - a²) ) / 8

So, plugging in the numbers:

( a² + b² - c² ) =32,

( a² + c² - b² )=50,

( b² + c² - a² )=128.

Product is 32*50*128=204,800

sqrt(204800)= 452.548... but exact value is 320 sqrt(2), as I had.

So,

V = (4/3) * (320 sqrt(2)) /8

= (4/3) * (40 sqrt(2))

= (160/3) sqrt(2)

So, V=160√2 /3.

Wait, let me confirm if this formula is correct. Alternatively, I can cross-check with the Cayley-Menger determinant.

If V=160√2 /3, then the Cayley-Menger determinant should be |CM|= 288 V² = 288*( (160√2 /3)^2 )

Compute that:

(160√2 /3)^2 = (25600 *2)/9 = 51200/9

So, 288*(51200/9) = (288/9)*51200 = 32 *51200= 1,638,400

So, if the determinant is 1,638,400, then V=160√2/3 is correct.

But I don't know if that's accurate, as I might have made a mistake in the formula.

Alternatively, maybe I can compute the determinant numerically.

Wait, let's compute the determinant numerically.

From the transformed Cayley-Menger matrix:

Row0: 0, 1, 1, 1, 1

Row1: 1, -1, 40, 79, 88

Row2: 1, 40, -1, 88, 79

Row3: 1,79,88,-1,40

Row4: 1,88,79,40,-1

Let me compute the determinant numerically using expansion.

As before, det(CM) = -1*M10 +1*M20 -1*M30 +1*M40

If I can compute M10, which is the determinant after removing row1 and column0.

M10 is:

Row0: [1,1,1,1]

Row1: [40,-1,88,79]

Row2: [79,88,-1,40]

Row3: [88,79,40,-1]

Compute det(M10). Let's compute it step by step.

Expand along the first row:

1 * det([[-1,88,79],[88,-1,40],[79,40,-1]])

-1 * det([[40,88,79],[79,-1,40],[88,40,-1]])

+1 * det([[40,-1,79],[79,88,40],[88,79,-1]])

-1 * det([[40,-1,88],[79,88,-1],[88,79,40]])

I computed the first minor earlier as 571,744.

Wait, perhaps I can compute each minor numerically.

First minor: det([[-1,88,79],[88,-1,40],[79,40,-1]])

We computed this as 571,744.

Second minor: det([[40,88,79],[79,-1,40],[88,40,-1]])

Let me compute this determinant.

Compute using cofactor expansion along the first row:

40 * det([[-1,40],[40,-1]]) 
-88 * det([[79,40],[88,-1]])
+79 * det([[79,-1],[88,40]])

Compute each term:

First term: 40 * [ (-1)(-1) - (40)(40) ] =40*(1 -1600)=40*(-1599)= -63,960

Second term: -88 * [ (79)(-1) - (40)(88) ] = -88*(-79 - 3520)= -88*(-3599)= +88*3599= Let me compute 88*3599:

Compute 88*(3600-1)=88*3600 -88= 316,800 -88=316,712

Third term: 79 * [ (79)(40) - (-1)(88) ] =79*(3160 +88)=79*3248

Compute 79*3248:

3248 *80=259,840

Minus 3248*(1)=3,248

So, 259,840 -3,248=256,592

So, the third term:79*3248=256,592

Now, sum the three terms:

-63,960 +316,712 +256,592

First, -63,960 +316,712=252,752

Then, 252,752 +256,592=509,344

So, the second minor is 509,344.

Third minor: det([[40,-1,79],[79,88,40],[88,79,-1]])

Compute this determinant.

Expand along first row:

40 * det([[88,40],[79,-1]])
- (-1) * det([[79,40],[88,-1]])
+79 * det([[79,88],[88,79]])

Compute each term:

First term:40 * [ (88)(-1) - (40)(79) ]=40*(-88 -3160)=40*(-3248)= -129,920

Second term: +1 * [ (79)(-1) - (40)(88) ]=1*(-79 -3520)= -3599

Third term:79 * [ (79)(79) - (88)(88) ]=79*(6241 - 7744)=79*(-1503)= -118,717

So, sum the three terms:

-129,920 -3,599 -118,717

First, -129,920 -3,599= -133,519

Then, -133,519 -118,717= -252,236

So, the third minor is -252,236.

Fourth minor: det([[40,-1,88],[79,88,-1],[88,79,40]])

Compute this determinant.

Expand along first row:

40 * det([[88,-1],[79,40]])
- (-1) * det([[79,-1],[88,40]])
+88 * det([[79,88],[88,79]])

Compute each term:

First term:40 * [ (88)(40) - (-1)(79) ]=40*(3520 +79)=40*3599=143,960

Second term: +1 * [ (79)(40) - (-1)(88) ]=1*(3160 +88)=3248

Third term:88 * [ (79)(79) - (88)(88) ]=88*(6241 -7744)=88*(-1503)= -132,264

Sum the terms:

143,960 +3,248 -132,264

First, 143,960 +3,248=147,208

Then, 147,208 -132,264=14,944

So, the fourth minor is 14,944.

Now, putting it all together:

det(M10) = 1*(571,744) -1*(509,344) +1*(-252,236) -1*(14,944)

Compute step by step:

1. 571,744 -509,344 = 62,400

2. 62,400 -252,236 = -189,836

3. -189,836 -14,944= -204,780

So, det(M10)= -204,780

Similarly, since the minors are not all the same due to the alternating signs, perhaps the other minors have similar values.

But since the matrix is symmetric, perhaps M20, M30, M40 have determinants that are permutations or have similar magnitudes.

But without computing all, let me proceed with the formula:

det(CM) = -1*M10 +1*M20 -1*M30 +1*M40

Assuming det(M10)=det(M20)=det(M30)=det(M40)= -204,780, which is not the case because signs alternate.

Wait, but in reality, each minor might have different values, making this approach too time-consuming.

Alternatively, perhaps I can accept that the volume V is 160√2 /3 and proceed to find the inradius.

But let me check if this volume makes sense with the Cayley-Menger determinant.

If det(CM)=288 V²=288*( (160√2 /3)^2 )=288*(25600*2/9)=288*(51200/9)=32*51200=1,638,400.

But computing the determinant step by step gave det(M10)= -204,780, which is part of the determinant, but the overall determinant is a combination of these minors.

Since this approach is too tedious, perhaps I can accept that V=160√2 /3 and S=6√21, then compute r=3V/S.

Compute r=3*(160√2 /3) / (6√21)= (160√2) / (6√21)= (80√2)/(3√21)

Simplify by rationalizing the denominator:

(80√2)/(3√21) * (√21/√21)= 80√42 / (3*21)=80√42 /63= (80/63)√42

Simplify 80 and 63: they are coprime, since 80=16*5, 63=7*9.

And 42 factors into 2*3*7, which is square-free.

So, r= (80√42)/63, which can be written as (80√42)/63.

But the problem states that the distance can be written as m√n /p, with m and p coprime, and n square-free.

Here, m=80, n=42, p=63.

Check if 80 and 63 are coprime: 80 factors into 2^4*5, 63 into 7*3^2. No common factors, so yes.

n=42, which is square-free (since 42=2*3*7, no square factors).

So, the answer is m+n+p=80+42+63= 185.

Wait, 80+42 is 122, plus 63 is 185.

But wait, let me make sure that the volume I used is correct. Because if V is incorrect, then r would be incorrect.

Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the formula.

Wait, in the formula, I used V=(4/3)*sqrt( (a² + b² - c²)(a² + c² - b²)(b² + c² - a²) )/8

Wait, perhaps the correct formula is V = sqrt( (a² + b² - c²)(a² + c² - b²)(b² + c² - a²) ) / ( 72 )

Wait, let me verify.

Upon some research in my mind, I found that for a disphenoid, the volume is given by:

V = sqrt( (a² + b² - c²)(a² + c² - b²)(b² + c² - a²) ) / ( 72 )

But in our case,

(a² + b² - c²)=32,

(a² + c² - b²)=50,

(b² + c² - a²)=128,

So, product is 32*50*128=204,800.

Thus, V= sqrt(204800)/72.

sqrt(204800)=sqrt(2048 *100)=10*sqrt(2048)=10*32*sqrt(2)=320√2.

So, V=320√2 /72= (320/72)√2= (40/9)√2

Wait, that contradicts the earlier value I used of 160√2/3.

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula is V= sqrt( (a² + b² - c²)(a² + c² - b²)(b² + c² - a²) ) / ( 72 )

So, plugging in the numbers:

V= sqrt(32*50*128)/72 = sqrt(204800)/72 = (320√2)/72= (40√2)/9

So, V=40√2 /9.

Then, S=6√21.

Thus, r=3V/S=3*(40√2/9)/(6√21)= (120√2/9)/(6√21)= (120√2)/(54√21)= (20√2)/(9√21)

Rationalizing:

(20√2)/(9√21)=20√(2*21)/(9*21)=20√42/(189)

Simplify numerator and denominator:

20 and 189: 20=2^2*5, 189=3^3*7, so no common factors.

Thus, r=20√42 /189.

Which can be written as (20√42)/189.

So, m=20, n=42, p=189.

Check if 20 and 189 are coprime: Yes, since 20=2^2*5, and 189=3^3*7.

And 42 is square-free.

So, m+n+p=20+42+189=251.

But this contradicts my earlier approach. So, which one is correct?

Wait, I think I made a mistake in the formula earlier. Let me double-check.

The correct formula for the volume of a disphenoid is V = sqrt( (a² + b² - c²)(a² + c² - b²)(b² + c² - a²) ) / 72.

So, that's V= sqrt(32*50*128)/72 = sqrt(204800)/72= 452.548/72≈6.285.

Wait, but the Heron's formula gave face area as (3√21)/2, so S=6√21≈27.495.

Then, r=3V/S≈3*6.285/27.495≈0.566.

But in the first approach, V=160√2/3≈76.981, which would give a much larger r.

But since the tetrahedron is a disphenoid with congruent faces, the formula V= sqrt( (a² + b² -c²)(a² +c² -b²)(b² +c² -a²) ) /72 must be correct.

So, V=40√2/9.

Thus, r=3*(40√2/9)/(6√21)= (120√2/9)/(6√21)= same as before.

So, r=20√42 /189.

Thus, m=20, n=42, p=189.

Sum=20+42+189=251.

But wait, let me make sure that the formula is accurate.

Upon further reflection, I think the formula for the volume of a disphenoid is indeed V= sqrt( (a² + b² -c²)(a² +c² -b²)(b² +c² -a²) ) /72.

Thus, my answer should be 251.

But wait, in the initial problem statement, the edges are AB=CD=√41, AC=BD=√80, and BC=AD=√89.

Thus, a=√41, b=√80, c=√89.

So, computing (a² + b² -c²)=41+80-89=32,

(a² +c² -b²)=41+89-80=50,

(b² +c² -a²)=80+89-41=128.

So, product is 32*50*128=204,800.

sqrt(204800)=452.548≈320√2, as 320*1.414≈452.5.

So, V=320√2 /72= (40√2)/9.

Thus, V=40√2/9.

Now, surface area S=6√21.

Thus, inradius r=3V/S=3*(40√2/9)/(6√21)= (120√2/9)/(6√21)= (120√2)/(54√21)= (20√2)/(9√21)=20√42/189.

So, r=20√42/189.

Thus, m=20, n=42, p=189.

m and p are coprime: 20 and 189 share no common factors.

n=42 is square-free: 42=2*3*7, no square factors.

Thus, m+n+p=20+42+189=251.

Therefore, the answer is 251.


To solve the problem, we first recognize that the tetrahedron \(ABCD\) is a disphenoid, meaning all opposite edges are equal and all four faces are congruent triangles. The given edge lengths are \(AB = CD = \sqrt{41}\), \(AC = BD = \sqrt{80}\), and \(BC = AD = \sqrt{89}\).

### Step 1: Calculate the Volume
The volume \(V\) of a disphenoid can be calculated using the formula:
\[
V = \frac{\sqrt{(a^2 + b^2 - c^2)(a^2 + c^2 - b^2)(b^2 + c^2 - a^2)}}{72}
\]
where \(a = \sqrt{41}\), \(b = \sqrt{80}\), and \(c = \sqrt{89}\).

First, compute the terms:
\[
a^2 + b^2 - c^2 = 41 + 80 - 89 = 32
\]
\[
a^2 + c^2 - b^2 = 41 + 89 - 80 = 50
\]
\[
b^2 + c^2 - a^2 = 80 + 89 - 41 = 128
\]
The product of these terms is:
\[
32 \times 50 \times 128 = 204,800
\]
Taking the square root:
\[
\sqrt{204,800} = 320\sqrt{2}
\]
Thus, the volume is:
\[
V = \frac{320\sqrt{2}}{72} = \frac{40\sqrt{2}}{9}
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the Surface Area
Each face is a triangle with sides \(\sqrt{41}\), \(\sqrt{80}\), and \(\sqrt{89}\). Using Heron's formula, the area of one face is:
\[
\text{Area} = \frac{3\sqrt{21}}{2}
\]
Since there are four congruent faces, the total surface area \(S\) is:
\[
S = 4 \times \frac{3\sqrt{21}}{2} = 6\sqrt{21}
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the Inradius
The inradius \(r\) of a tetrahedron is given by:
\[
r = \frac{3V}{S}
\]
Substituting the values:
\[
r = \frac{3 \times \frac{40\sqrt{2}}{9}}{6\sqrt{21}} = \frac{120\sqrt{2}}{54\sqrt{21}} = \frac{20\sqrt{2}}{9\sqrt{21}}
\]
Rationalizing the denominator:
\[
r = \frac{20\sqrt{42}}{189}
\]
This simplifies to the form \(\frac{m\sqrt{n}}{p}\), where \(m = 20\), \(n = 42\), and \(p = 189\). These values satisfy the conditions that \(m\) and \(p\) are coprime, and \(n\) is square-free.

### Final Answer
The sum \(m + n + p = 20 + 42 + 189 = 251\).

\boxed{251}
