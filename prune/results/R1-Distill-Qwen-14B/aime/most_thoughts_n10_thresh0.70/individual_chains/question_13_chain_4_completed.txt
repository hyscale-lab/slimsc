Okay, so I've got this math problem here, and I need to figure out how long Aya's walk takes her when she walks at a speed of s + ½ kilometers per hour, including the time she spends in the coffee shop. Hmm, let's break this down step by step.

First, the problem says that every morning Aya goes for a 9-kilometer-long walk and stops at a coffee shop afterwards. When she walks at a constant speed of s km/h, her walk takes 4 hours, which includes t minutes in the coffee shop. When she increases her speed to s + 2 km/h, her walk time decreases to 2 hours and 24 minutes, still including t minutes in the coffee shop. 

Wait, so the total time she spends each morning is the time walking plus the time in the coffee shop, which is t minutes. But in the problem, they mention both scenarios include t minutes in the coffee shop. So, I think the key here is to set up equations based on the information given and solve for s and t. Once I have s, I can calculate the time she takes when her speed is s + ½ km/h.

Let me write down what I know:

1. Distance walked: 9 km
2. First scenario: speed = s km/h, total time = 4 hours = 240 minutes (since 4*60=240), which includes walking time plus t minutes in the coffee shop.
3. Second scenario: speed = s + 2 km/h, total time = 2 hours and 24 minutes. Let me convert that to minutes: 2*60 +24 = 120 +24 = 144 minutes. So, total time is 144 minutes, which again includes walking time plus t minutes.

Wait, so the total time in each case is the walking time plus t. So, for the first scenario:

Walking time at speed s: (9 / s) hours. Then, convert that to minutes because the total time is given in minutes. So, 9/s hours multiplied by 60 minutes per hour gives (540/s) minutes. Then, the total time is walking time plus t, which is 240 minutes. So, equation one is:

540/s + t = 240.

Similarly, for the second scenario, walking speed is s + 2, so walking time is 9/(s + 2) hours, which in minutes is (540)/(s + 2). The total time is 144 minutes. So, equation two is:

540/(s + 2) + t = 144.

So now I have two equations:

1. 540/s + t = 240
2. 540/(s + 2) + t = 144

I can subtract the second equation from the first to eliminate t:

(540/s + t) - (540/(s + 2) + t) = 240 - 144
Simplify that:

540/s - 540/(s + 2) = 96

Let me factor out 540:

540 [1/s - 1/(s + 2)] = 96

Compute the difference in the brackets:

1/s - 1/(s + 2) = [ (s + 2) - s ] / [s(s + 2)] = 2 / [s(s + 2)]

So now, equation becomes:

540 * [2 / (s(s + 2))] = 96

Simplify:

(540 * 2) / [s(s + 2)] = 96

Which is:

1080 / [s(s + 2)] = 96

Multiply both sides by s(s + 2):

1080 = 96 s (s + 2)

Divide both sides by 96 to simplify:

1080 / 96 = s (s + 2)

Calculate 1080 ÷ 96:

Let me see, 96 goes into 1080 how many times? 96*10=960, 1080-960=120. 96 goes into 120 once, with 24 left. So 10 + 1 =11, and 24/96 = 0.25. So total is 11.25.

So:

11.25 = s^2 + 2s

Rewriting this as a quadratic equation:

s^2 + 2s - 11.25 = 0

Hmm, solving for s. Let's use the quadratic formula. The quadratic is s^2 + 2s - 11.25 = 0.

The quadratic formula is s = [ -b ± sqrt(b² - 4ac) ] / (2a), where a=1, b=2, c=-11.25.

So, discriminant D = b² - 4ac = (2)^2 - 4*1*(-11.25) =4 + 45=49.

Square root of 49 is 7. So,

s = [ -2 ± 7 ] / 2.

We have two solutions:

s = (-2 +7)/2 =5/2=2.5

s = (-2-7)/2= -9/2= -4.5

But speed can't be negative, so s=2.5 km/h.

So, s is 2.5 km/h. Now, I can find t from one of the original equations.

Let me use the first equation:

540/s + t =240.

Plug in s=2.5:

540 / 2.5 = t + (something...)

Wait, 540 divided by 2.5. Let me compute that.

540 / 2.5 = (540 * 2) /5 = 1080 /5 = 216 minutes.

So,

216 + t =240.

So t =240 -216=24 minutes.

So, t is 24 minutes. That makes sense.

Now, the question is, when Aya walks at s + ½ km/h, how much time does the walk take her, including t minutes.

So, her new speed is s + ½ = 2.5 + 0.5 =3 km/h.

Compute the time she takes to walk 9 km at 3 km/h.

Time in hours: distance/speed=9/3=3 hours.

Convert 3 hours to minutes: 3*60=180 minutes.

But wait, that's just the walking time. The total time includes t=24 minutes in the coffee shop.

So, total time is 180 +24=204 minutes.

Wait, but let me make sure. So, when she walks at 3 km/h, the walking time is 3 hours, which is 180 minutes. Then she stops for t=24 minutes, so total 180 +24=204 minutes.

So, the answer is 204 minutes.

Wait, let me recheck all calculations.

First, s was 2.5, so s + ½=3.

9 km at 3 km/h is 3 hours.

3 hours is 180 minutes, plus 24 minutes coffee shop is 204 minutes. Yes, that's correct.

Alternatively, maybe the problem expects just the walking time? Wait, the problem says "the number of minutes the walk takes her, including the t minutes spent in the coffee shop." So, yes, total time from when she starts walking until she leaves the coffee shop, which is 180 +24=204 minutes.

Is there another way to get the same result? Let me think.

Alternatively, using the original equations:

We have s=2.5, t=24.

So, when the speed is s + ½ = 3 km/h, the walking time is 9/3=3 hours=180 minutes, plus t=24 minutes, so total is 204 minutes.

Yes, that's consistent.

I think that's solid. So, the answer is 204 minutes.


To solve the problem, we start by setting up equations based on the given information. Aya walks 9 kilometers and spends time in a coffee shop, with the total time including her walking and coffee breaks.

1. When walking at speed \( s \) km/h, the total time is 4 hours (240 minutes):
   \[
   \frac{9}{s} \times 60 + t = 240
   \]
   Simplifying:
   \[
   \frac{540}{s} + t = 240 \quad \text{(Equation 1)}
   \]

2. When walking at speed \( s + 2 \) km/h, the total time is 2 hours and 24 minutes (144 minutes):
   \[
   \frac{9}{s + 2} \times 60 + t = 144
   \]
   Simplifying:
   \[
   \frac{540}{s + 2} + t = 144 \quad \text{(Equation 2)}
   \]

Subtracting Equation 2 from Equation 1 to eliminate \( t \):
\[
\frac{540}{s} - \frac{540}{s + 2} = 96
\]
Simplify:
\[
540 \left( \frac{1}{s} - \frac{1}{s + 2} \right) = 96
\]
\[
540 \left( \frac{2}{s(s + 2)} \right) = 96
\]
\[
\frac{1080}{s(s + 2)} = 96
\]
\[
1080 = 96s(s + 2)
\]
\[
s^2 + 2s - 11.25 = 0
\]

Solving the quadratic equation \( s^2 + 2s - 11.25 = 0 \) using the quadratic formula:
\[
s = \frac{-2 \pm \sqrt{4 + 45}}{2} = \frac{-2 \pm 7}{2}
\]
Since speed cannot be negative, \( s = 2.5 \) km/h.

Substituting \( s = 2.5 \) into Equation 1 to find \( t \):
\[
\frac{540}{2.5} + t = 240
\]
\[
216 + t = 240
\]
\[
t = 24 \text{ minutes}
\]

When Aya walks at \( s + \frac{1}{2} = 3 \) km/h, the walking time is:
\[
\frac{9}{3} = 3 \text{ hours} = 180 \text{ minutes}
\]
Including the coffee shop time:
\[
180 + 24 = 204 \text{ minutes}
\]

The final answer is:
\[
\boxed{204}
\]
