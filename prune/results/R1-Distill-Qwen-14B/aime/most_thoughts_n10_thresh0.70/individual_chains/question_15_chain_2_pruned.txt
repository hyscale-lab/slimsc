Okay, so I have this problem about counting the number of paths on an 8x8 grid. The paths go from the lower left corner to the upper right corner, and they're of length 16. I need to find how many such paths change direction exactly four times.

Hmm, let's start by understanding the grid. An 8x8 grid means there are 8 rows and 8 columns, right? So, moving from the lower left to the upper right corner would involve moving 8 steps right and 8 steps up, totaling 16 steps. That makes sense because each path is of length 16. 

But wait, the problem is about paths that change direction exactly four times. I remember that in grid paths, direction changes happen when you switch from moving right to up or up to right. So, for example, if you go right, right, up, up, right, that's two direction changes: right to up, then up to right.

So, each time the path switches from moving in one direction to another, that's a direction change. The problem wants only those paths that change direction exactly four times. So, I need to figure out how many such paths exist.

Let me think about how direction changes relate to the number of segments in the path. Each direction change would create a new segment. So, if a path changes direction four times, how many segments does it have?

Well, the first move is a segment. Every time you change direction, you add another segment. So, four direction changes would result in five segments. For example, four changes would mean five segments: right, up, right, up, right, etc., depending on the starting direction.

Wait, actually, no. Let me think again. If you start moving right, that's one segment. Then you change to up for another segment. That's two direction changes? Or is it each time you switch, you count a change. So, starting right, then changing to up is one change, then changing back to right is another change. So, each switch is a direction change.

So, if the path changes direction four times, that would imply five segments. Because each direction change adds a new segment. So, initial segment, then four changes, so five segments in total.

Each segment is a straight line either going right or up. So, the path alternates between right and up segments, but the number of segments is five. Hmm.

Wait, each time you change direction, you alternate between right and up. So, if the path starts with right, then it goes right, up, right, up, right, up, right, up. Wait, but that would be four direction changes, resulting in five segments.

Wait, no. Let me count the number of direction changes. Starting with right, then up is one change, then right is a second change, up is third, right is fourth, and up is fifth? No, that can't be right. Because each time you switch, it's a direction change. So, starting right, then up is one change. Then right again is the second change. Then up is the third, then right is the fourth. So, four changes would result in five segments. So, the number of direction changes is one
