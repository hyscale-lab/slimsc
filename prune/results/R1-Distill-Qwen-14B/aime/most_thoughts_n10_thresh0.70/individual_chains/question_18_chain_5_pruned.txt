Okay, so I need to find the number of rectangles that can be formed inside a regular dodecagon (12-gon) where each side of the rectangle lies on either a side or a diagonal of the dodecagon. Hmm, this sounds a bit tricky, but let me try to break it down.

First, I remember that a regular dodecagon has 12 sides, all of equal length, and all internal angles equal. Each internal angle in a regular dodecagon is 150 degrees, right? But maybe that's not super relevant here.

The problem mentions rectangles formed by sides or diagonals of the dodecagon. So, I think each side of the rectangle is either a side or a diagonal of the dodecagon. That means the rectangle's sides are aligned with lines connecting vertices of the dodecagon.

Wait, but how can four such lines form a rectangle? I suppose the key here is that the sides of the rectangle must be parallel to each other and meet at right angles. So, in the dodecagon, certain diagonals or sides will be parallel, and when they intersect, they form right angles.

I remember that in regular polygons, certain diagonals are parallel. For example, in a regular hexagon, each side is parallel to the one three steps away. So, in a dodecagon, which has 12 sides, perhaps similar properties apply. Let me think.

In a regular polygon with n sides, two diagonals are parallel if they connect vertices that are k steps apart, where k is the same for both diagonals, and they are offset by a certain number of vertices. For a dodecagon, n=12, so the number of possible k values is from 1 to 5, since beyond that, they start repeating in the other direction.

Wait, no, n=12, so the number of distinct step sizes for diagonals is (n-3)/2 when n is even. Let me calculate that: (12-3)/2 = 4.5, which doesn't make sense. Wait, maybe for n even, it's (n/2 -1). So 12/2 -1=5, so k can be 1,2,3,4,5. But for a 12-gon, 12 is even, so each diagonal has a different length. So, the diagonals can be categorized by the number of vertices they skip.

So, for each vertex, you can draw diagonals that skip 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5 vertices. Each of these diagonals will have different lengths and different angles with respect to the sides.

But how does this relate to rectangles? Well, a rectangle is defined by two pairs of parallel sides, each pair at right angles to the other. So, in the dodecagon, I need to find two different sets of parallel lines (each set corresponding to a certain step size k) that intersect to form four right angles.

Wait, actually, for each rectangle, the sides must be two pairs of parallel sides. So, each rectangle is determined by two different step sizes, say k and m, such that the corresponding diagonals are perpendicular to each other.

Wait, no, they
