Okay, let me try to figure out this geometry problem. Hmm, it's about two rectangles, ABCD and EFGH. The points D, E, C, F are collinear. Also, points A, D, H, G lie on a circle. We're given some side lengths: BC is 16, AB is 107, FG is 17, and EF is 184. We need to find the length of CE.

Alright, let me start by visualizing the problem. So we have two rectangles. Let me draw a rough sketch in my mind. Rectangle ABCD has AB = 107 and BC = 16. So AB is the longer side, and BC is the shorter side. Similarly, rectangle EFGH has FG = 17 and EF = 184. So EF is longer than FG.

Points D, E, C, F are collinear. So that means they lie on a straight line. Let me note the order of these points. The order isn't specified, but since D is a corner of rectangle ABCD and E is a corner of EFGH, maybe the order is D-E-C-F or something like that along the line.

Also, A, D, H, G lie on a circle. So quadrilateral ADHG is cyclic. That's an important piece of information because cyclic quadrilaterals have properties that can be useful, like opposite angles summing to 180 degrees, or the power of a point theorem.

Let me try to label the rectangles. In rectangle ABCD, AB and CD are the lengths, so AB = CD = 107, and BC = AD = 16. Similarly, in rectangle EFGH, EF = GH = 184, and FG = EH = 17.

Since D, E, C, F are collinear, let's assume the line is horizontal for simplicity. So D is a corner of ABCD, and E is a corner of EFGH. If we think of them being on the same horizontal line, perhaps E is to the right of D, and C is to the right of E, with F to the right of C.

Wait, but C is a corner of ABCD, so if we're looking at ABCD, let me fix the orientation. Let me consider ABCD with AB as the top side, BC as the right side. So, if I'm looking at the rectangle, A is top-left, B is top-right, C is bottom-right, D is bottom-left. So, ABCD is arranged such that AB is the top, BC is the right side, CD is the bottom, and DA is the left side.

Similarly, EFGH is another rectangle. Let me fix its orientation as well. Let me say E is the top-left, F is top-right, G is bottom-right, H is bottom-left. So EFGH is arranged with EF as the top, FG as the right side, GH as the bottom, and HE as the left side.

Now, D, E, C, F are collinear. So if D is the bottom-left corner of ABCD, and C is the bottom-right corner, then the line DC is the base of rectangle ABCD. E and F are points on this line. So E must be somewhere between D and C, or maybe beyond. Similarly, F is a corner of EFGH, so F is the top-right corner of EFGH. Wait, but if F is on the line DC, which is the base of ABCD, that seems a bit confusing because F is a top-right corner. Hmm, maybe I need to reorient.

Alternatively, perhaps the line is vertical? Let me think again. If D, E, C, F are collinear, it could be a vertical line. Let me consider that.

Wait, no, because in rectangle ABCD, D is a corner, and C is the opposite corner, so DC is a diagonal. But wait, in a rectangle, opposite corners are connected by the diagonal, which is longer. But the problem says D, E, C, F are collinear, so they lie on a straight line. So this line is not a diagonal of the rectangle but a straight line that passes through these four points.

Wait, but C is a corner of ABCD and F is a corner of EFGH, so perhaps the line is DC extended beyond C to F, and E is somewhere on that line between D and C or beyond.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me try to assign coordinates to these points to make it clearer.

Let me place point D at the origin (0,0). Since ABCD is a rectangle with AB = 107 and BC = 16, so AD = BC = 16, and DC = AB = 107. So if D is at (0,0), then C would be at (107,0), because DC is the base. Then, A would be at (
