Okay, so I've got this problem here where I need to find the number of triples of nonnegative integers (a, b, c) that satisfy two conditions: a + b + c = 300 and a²b + a²c + b²a + b²c + c²a + c²b = 6,000,000.

Hmm, let me start by understanding what these equations represent. The first equation is straightforward—it's the sum of a, b, and c being 300. The second one is a bit more complicated; it's a combination of terms where each variable is squared and multiplied by the other two. Let me think about how to approach this.

Maybe I can simplify the second equation. Let me write it down again:

a²b + a²c + b²a + b²c + c²a + c²b = 6,000,000.

I notice that each term is of the form a² multiplied by b or c, and similarly for the other variables. Maybe I can factor this expression somehow. Let me try factoring:

Looking at the terms, I can factor a² from the first two terms, b² from the next two, and c² from the last two:

a²(b + c) + b²(a + c) + c²(a + b) = 6,000,000.

Hmm, that looks a bit better. Now, I know that a + b + c = 300. So, for example, b + c = 300 - a, a + c = 300 - b, and a + b = 300 - c.

Let me substitute these into the equation:

a²(300 - a) + b²(300 - b) + c²(300 - c) = 6,000,000.

That's better. Now, let me distribute each term:

a²*300 - a³ + b²*300 - b³ + c²*300 - c³ = 6,000,000.

I can factor out the 300:

300(a² + b² + c²) - (a³ + b³ + c³) = 6,000,000.

Hmm, okay. Let me write that as:

300(a² + b² + c²) - (a³ + b³ + c³) = 6,000,000.

I can divide both sides by 300 to make it simpler:

(a² + b² + c²) - (1/300)(a³ + b³ + c³) = 20,000.

Wait, that fractions might be messy. Maybe instead, let's keep it as:

300(a² + b² + c²) - (a³ + b³ + c³) = 6,000,000.

Hmm, maybe it's better to relate a² + b² + c² and a³ + b³ + c³ using the first equation a + b + c = 300.

I remember that (a + b + c)² = a² + b² + c² + 2(ab + bc + ca). Since a + b + c = 300, then:

300² = a² + b² + c² + 2(ab + bc + ca).

So, 90,000 = a² + b² + c² + 2(ab + bc + ca).

Let me denote S = a + b + c = 300, Q = ab + bc + ca, and P = abc.

Wait, but I don't know if that helps yet. Let me see:

We have from above that:

300(a² + b² + c²) - (a³ + b³ + c³) = 6,000,000.

I can rewrite a² as a*(a), so maybe factor each term:

a²*S - a³ = a²(300 - a) = a²*b + a²*c, which is consistent with the previous step.

Wait, maybe instead of that, let's find a way to express a³ + b³ + c³ in terms of S, Q, and P.

I remember that a³ + b³ + c³ can be expressed as S³ - 3S Q + 3P.

Wait, let me recall the identity:

a³ + b³ + c³ = (a + b + c)^3 - 3(a
