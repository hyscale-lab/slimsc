Okay, so Alice and Bob are playing a game with a stack of n tokens. They take turns removing either 1 or 4 tokens, Alice goes first. The person who takes the last token wins. I need to find how many positive integers n ≤ 2024 are such that Bob can guarantee a win, no matter how Alice plays.

Hmm, this sounds like a combinatorial game theory problem. I remember that in such games, certain positions are called "winning positions" and others are "losing positions." A winning position means the current player can force a win, and a losing position means no matter what the current player does, the opponent can force a win.

So, for this game, I need to figure out for each n whether it's a winning or losing position for the first player (Alice). If it's a losing position for Alice, that means Bob can win regardless of her moves. So my goal is to find all n ≤ 2024 where n is a losing position for the first player.

Let me try to find a pattern by starting small.

Let’s list out the positions from n=0 upwards and mark them as winning (W) or losing (L).

n=0: Well, if there are no tokens, the game is over. So the player who is supposed to move loses. But wait, in our case, the last player to take a token wins, so n=0 means the previous player took the last token and won. So n=0 is a losing position because the current player can't move. So maybe n=0 is L.

n=1: The current player can take 1 token and win. So W.

n=2: Current player can take 1, leaving 1 for the opponent, who then takes it and wins. Wait, no, wait. If n=2, player takes 1, leaving 1. Then the opponent takes 1 and wins. So n=2 is a losing position? Or wait, let me think again.

Wait, if n=2, current player can take 1, leaving 1. Then opponent takes 1 and wins. So current player cannot force a win? That would make n=2 a losing position. Or is there another move?

Wait, can the current player take 4 from n=2? No, because n=2 <4. So only option is to take 1. So n=2 is a losing position? So L.

Wait, but n=1, the current player takes 1 and wins, so W.

n=2: only move is to 1, which is W for the opponent. So n=2 is L.

n=3: current player can take 1 token, leaving 2, which is L for the opponent. Because opponent is in a losing position, so current player can force a win by moving to L. So n=3 is W.

n=4: current player can take 4 tokens and win immediately. So W.

n=5: current player can take 1, leaving 4 (W for opponent), or take 4, leaving 1 (W for opponent). Either way, opponent can win. So n=5 is L.

n=6: current player can take 1, leaving 5 (L for opponent). So current player can force a win by moving to L. So n=6 is W.
