Okay, so I have this problem about residents in Aimeville and the things they own. There are 900 residents in total. Each resident owns a bag of candy hearts, and then there are three other items: diamond rings, golf clubs, and garden spades. The numbers given are:

- 195 own a diamond ring
- 367 own a set of golf clubs
- 562 own a garden spade

Additionally, every resident owns a bag of candy hearts. So, that's the fourth item everyone has.

The problem also states that 437 residents own exactly two of these things, and 234 own exactly three. We're supposed to find how many own all four.

Hmm, this feels like a problem that involves the principle of inclusion-exclusion. I remember that principle helps calculate the size of the union of multiple sets by adding their individual sizes, subtracting the intersections, adding back the triple overlaps, and so on. But here, we're dealing with four sets, but each person already owns the candy hearts. Wait, no, actually, candy hearts are included in all, so perhaps it's better to model this with four sets, including the candy hearts.

Wait, but the problem says "each of the 900 residents owns a bag of candy hearts." So candy hearts are a given for everyone. So maybe the other three items are optional. So, perhaps the problem is about three sets, but everyone is in all four. Hmm, I'm a bit confused.

Wait, no. Let me
