Okay, so I have this problem here about rectangular boxes with a given surface area and volume, and I need to find the radius of the smallest sphere that can contain each of these boxes. Then, I have to express r squared as a fraction p/q where p and q are coprime, and find p + q.

First, let me parse the problem. We have a set B of rectangular boxes. Each box has a surface area of 54 and a volume of 23. We need to find the smallest sphere that can contain any box from B. So, the sphere must be able to enclose any such box, meaning the sphere's diameter must be at least the space diagonal of the box. Because the sphere needs to contain the entire box, the diameter has to be equal to or larger than the box's diagonal. So, the sphere's radius will be half of the maximum space diagonal among all boxes in B.

So, the key here is to find the maximum possible space diagonal of a box with surface area 54 and volume 23. Then, the radius r will be half of that diagonal, and r squared will be (diagonal squared)/4. Then, we can express that as a reduced fraction.

Let me denote the edge lengths of the box as a, b, c. So, the surface area S is given by 2(ab + bc + ac) = 54, and the volume V is given by abc = 23.

The space diagonal D of the box is sqrt(a² + b² + c²). So, we need to maximize D given the constraints on S and V.

So, my goal is to maximize sqrt(a² + b² + c²) subject to 2(ab + bc + ac) = 54 and abc = 23.

Alternatively, to make it easier, I can maximize a² + b² + c² because the square root is a monotonically increasing function.

So, let me set up the problem: maximize a² + b² + c², given 2(ab + bc + ac) = 54 and abc = 23.

Hmm, how do I approach this? I think I can use some optimization techniques with constraints. Maybe Lagrange multipliers? But I might need to set up two constraints, so it might get a bit complicated. Alternatively, perhaps I can express two variables in terms of the third and then find maximum.

Wait, let's see. Let me write down the given equations:

1. 2(ab + bc + ac) = 54 → ab + bc + ac = 27.

2. abc = 23.

I need to maximize a² + b² + c².

I remember that for three variables, a² + b² + c² can be expressed in terms of (a + b + c)^2 minus 2(ab + bc + ac). So:

a² + b² + c² = (a + b + c)^2 - 2(ab + bc + ac) = (a + b + c)^2 - 2*27 = (a + b + c)^2 - 54.

So, to maximize a² + b² + c², I need to maximize (a + b + c)^2. Therefore, I need to maximize a + b + c.

So, the problem reduces to maximizing a + b + c given that ab + bc + ac = 27 and abc = 23.

Wait, but how do I maximize a + b + c with these constraints?

I recall that for numbers with a fixed product (abc), the sum a + b + c is maximized when the variables are as unequal as possible. But that's not necessarily always the case. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe I can fix one variable and express the other two in terms of it. Let me assume that a ≤ b ≤ c. So, perhaps I can set variables a, b, and c such that a is the smallest, c is the largest, and b is
