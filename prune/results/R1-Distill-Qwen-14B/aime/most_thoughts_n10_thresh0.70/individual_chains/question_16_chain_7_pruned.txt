Okay, so I have this math problem here. It says: Let p be the least prime number for which there exists a positive integer n such that n⁴ + 1 is divisible by p². Then I need to find the least positive integer m such that m⁴ + 1 is divisible by p².

Hmm, right. So, first, I think I need to find the smallest prime p where p² divides some n⁴ + 1. Then once I find that p, I have to find the smallest m where m⁴ + 1 is divisible by p².

Let me start by understanding what the problem is asking. So, I'm looking for primes p where p² divides n⁴ + 1 for some n. And p should be the smallest such prime. Then, for that p, find the smallest m such that m⁴ ≡ -1 mod p².

I remember that primes p where -1 is a quartic residue modulo p² are primes where p ≡ 1 mod 8. But I'm not entirely sure. Let me think about this.

First, let's check small primes. Let's list primes in order: 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, etc.

I need to find the smallest prime p such that p² divides n⁴ +1 for some n. So, for each prime, I can check if there exists an n where n⁴ ≡ -1 mod p².

Let me start with p=2. So, let's see if there's an n where n⁴ +1 is divisible by 4. Let's test n=1: 1⁴ +1=2, which isn't divisible by 4. n=2: 16 +1=17, which isn't divisible by 4. n=3: 81 +1=82, 82/4=20.5, so no. So, no n satisfies n⁴ +1 ≡0 mod 4. So p=2 is not possible.

Next prime, p=3. Let's see if n⁴ ≡ -1 mod 9. Let's compute n⁴ mod 9 for n=1 to 8.

n=1: 1 mod9
n=2: 16 mod9=7
n=3: 81 mod9=0
n=4: (256) mod9: 256/9=28*9=252, 256-252=4, so 4
n=5: 625 mod9: 625-69*9=625-621=4
Wait, 9*69=621, so 625-621=4, so 4
n=6: 1296 mod9=0
n=7: 7⁴=2401 mod9: 2401-266*9=2401-2394=7
n=8: 8⁴=4096 mod9: 4096/9=455*9=4095, remainder 1. So 1.

So n⁴ mod9 can be 0,1,4,7.

Looking for n⁴ ≡-1 mod9, which is 8 mod9. None of the residues above are 8. So p=3 doesn't work.

Next, p=5. Let's check if there's an n where n⁴ ≡ -1 mod25. Let's compute n⁴ mod25 for n=1 to 24.

Wait, that's a lot. Maybe there's a smarter way. Let's see, for modulus 5, n⁴ ≡0 or 1 mod5. Since 4 is even, or wait, 5 is prime, so by Fermat's little theorem, n⁴ ≡1 mod5 if n not divisible by 5. But for modulus 25, it's more complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps I can check if -1 is a quartic residue mod5²=25. I think I need to see if there exists x such that x⁴ ≡24 mod25. Let me try some numbers.

Let me try n=2: 16 mod25=16
n=3: 81 mod25=81-3*25=81-75=6
n=4: 256 mod25=256-10*25=256-250=6
n=7: 7⁴=2401 mod25: 2401/25=96*25=2400, so 1. So 1.
n=8: 8⁴=4096 mod25: 4096-163*25=4096-4075=21
n=12: 12⁴=20736 mod25: 20736/25=829*25=20725, so 20736-20725=11
n=13: 13⁴=28561 mod25: 28561-1142*25=28561-28550=11
n=17: 17⁴=83521 mod25: 83521-3340*25=83521-83500=21
n=18: 18⁴=104976 mod25: 104976-4199*25=104976-104975=1
n=22: 22⁴= (22²)^2=484². 484 mod25 is 484-19*25=484-475=9. So 9²=81 mod25=6.

Hmm, I didn't find any n where n⁴ ≡24 mod25. Maybe p=5 isn't the prime we're looking for. So p=5 doesn't work.

Next prime, p=7. Let's check if n⁴ ≡-1 mod49. So, n⁴ ≡48 mod49.

First, again, perhaps use some properties. For modulus 7, n⁴ ≡1 mod7 if n not divisible by 7. So, for modulus 49, we can try Hensel's lemma to lift solutions from mod7 to mod49.

But wait, in mod7, n⁴ ≡1, so n⁴ ≡-1 mod49 would require that n⁴ ≡48 mod49
