Okay, so I've got this problem about a torus and a sphere. Let me try to picture it. A torus is like a donut shape, right? It's formed by rotating a circle around an axis that's in the same plane as the circle but doesn't intersect it. In this case, the circle has a radius of 3, and the distance from the center of the circle to the axis is 6. So, the big circle around which the donut is formed has a radius of 6, and the tube of the donut has a radius of 3.

Now, the sphere S has a radius of 11. We have two scenarios: one where the torus rests inside the sphere and is tangent along a circle with radius r_i, and another where the torus rests outside the sphere and is tangent along a circle with radius r_o. We need to find the difference r_i - r_o and express it as a fraction m/n where m and n are coprime, then find m + n.

Hmm, okay. So, let me think about what it means for the torus to be tangent to the sphere in both cases. When the torus is inside the sphere, they are tangent internally along a circle, which I assume is a circle on both the sphere and the torus. Similarly, when the torus is outside, they are tangent externally along another circle.

I remember that a torus can be described using two radii: R, the distance from the center of the generating circle to the axis of revolution (which is 6 in this case), and r, the radius of the generating circle (which is 3). So, the major radius is 6, and the minor radius is 3.

When the torus is inside the sphere, the sphere's radius is 11. So, the sphere has a larger radius, and the torus is sitting inside it. The point of tangency is a circle. I think this circle lies on both the torus and the sphere. Similarly, when the torus is outside, the sphere is inside the torus, and they touch along another circle.

Let me try to visualize the internal tangency first. The torus is inside the sphere. The sphere has a radius of 11, so the center of the sphere must be at the center of the torus's generating circle, I suppose. Wait, no. Actually, the torus's center (the center of the generating circle) is 6 units away from the axis. Hmm, maybe I need to think in terms of the sphere's center and the torus's center.

Wait, perhaps it's better to model the torus mathematically. The torus can be represented in 3D coordinates with the equation: (sqrt(x² + y²) - R)^2 + z² = r², where R is 6 and r is 3. So, the equation becomes (sqrt(x² + y²) - 6)^2 + z² = 9.

The sphere S has a radius of 11, so its equation is x² + y² + z² = 11² = 121.

Now, when the torus is inside the sphere and tangent, their surfaces touch at exactly one point? No, wait, the problem says along a circle. So, they are tangent along a circle. That makes more sense.

So, the intersection of the torus and the sphere is a circle in both cases, but whether it's inside or outside depends on their positions.

Let me think about the internal tangent case first. The torus is inside the sphere, and they're tangent along a circle. So, this circle must lie on both surfaces.

To find the radius of this circle, maybe I can find the points where the two surfaces are tangent. At those points, their normals must be aligned. But perhaps it's easier to use some geometric reasoning.

Alternatively, perhaps I can consider the distance from the center of the sphere to the center of the torus. Wait, the torus is symmetric, so its center is at the origin, assuming the sphere is also centered at the origin.

Wait, if the sphere is centered at the origin, and the torus is also centered at the origin, then when the torus is inside the sphere, the point of tangency would be when the sphere's surface just touches the outer part of the torus.

Wait, no. The torus is like a donut, so its outer radius from the center is R + r = 6 + 3 = 9. And the sphere's radius is 11, which is larger than 9, so the torus can fit entirely inside the sphere without touching. But the problem says it's internally tangent. Hmm, that suggests that the sphere is just touching the torus.

Wait, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Maybe when the torus is inside the sphere, the sphere is
