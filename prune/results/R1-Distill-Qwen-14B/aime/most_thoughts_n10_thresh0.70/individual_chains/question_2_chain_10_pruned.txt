Okay, so I have this geometry problem here, and I need to figure out OC squared where C is a specific point on segment AB. Let me first parse the problem statement.

We have points O at (0,0), A at (1/2, 0), and B at (0, sqrt(3)/2). So O is the origin, A is on the x-axis halfway between O and (1,0), and B is on the y-axis, a bit higher—specifically, sqrt(3)/2 is approximately 0.866, so it's more than halfway up to (0,1).

The family F consists of segments PQ of unit length lying in the first quadrant, with P on the x-axis and Q on the y-axis. So each PQ is a line segment from some point P(p,0) to Q(0,q), where p and q are positive real numbers, and the length of PQ is 1. 

The problem says there's a unique point C on AB, different from A and B, that doesn't belong to any segment from F other than AB itself. So, C is on AB, and except for the segment AB itself, none of the other segments in F pass through C.

I need to find OC squared, which will be a fraction p/q where p and q are coprime, and then find p + q.

Hmm. So, to approach this, maybe I should parametrize AB, find the equation of AB, then find the point C on AB such that no other segment from F passes through C except AB.

First, let me find the equation of AB. Points A and B are given, so let's find the slope.

Slope of AB: (y2 - y1)/(x2 - x1) = (sqrt(3)/2 - 0)/(0 - 1/2) = (sqrt(3)/2)/(-1/2) = -sqrt(3).

So the equation is y - 0 = -sqrt(3)(x - 1/2). Simplifying, y = -sqrt(3)x + (sqrt(3)/2).

Wait, but actually, point A is at (1/2, 0), so plugging x = 1/2, y = 0, which works. Point B is at (0, sqrt(3)/2). Plugging x=0, y = sqrt(3)/2. Correct.

So parametric equations for AB: since it goes from A(1/2, 0) to B(0, sqrt(3)/2), we can parametrize it with a parameter t from 0 to 1.

Let me write the parametric equations as:

x = (1/2)(1 - t)
y = 0 + (sqrt(3)/2) t

Here, when t=0, we're at A(1/2, 0), and when t=1, we're at B(0, sqrt(3)/2). So, any point C on AB can be written as ((1/2)(1 - t), (sqrt(3)/2) t) for some t between 0 and 1.

We need to find the specific t such that C is on AB but not on any other segment from F except AB.

So, for the rest of the problem, I need to think about the family F. Each segment PQ is from (p,0) to (0,q), with length 1.

So, the length of PQ is sqrt(p² + q²) = 1, so p² + q² = 1.

So, for each p between 0 and 1, q is sqrt(1 - p²), and vice versa.

So, each such segment PQ can be represented parametrically as (p,0) to (0,q), so any point on PQ can be written as (p(1 - s), q s), where s ranges from 0 to 1.

So, a point on such a segment is (p(1 - s), q s). We can also write this as (p(1 - s), sqrt(1 - p²) s).

Wait, since p² + q² = 1, q = sqrt(1 - p²).

So, for each p in (0,1), the segment from (p,0) to (0, sqrt(1 - p²)).

Now, the point C is on AB, which is parameterized as ( (1/2)(1 - t), (sqrt(3)/2) t ). So, for some t, the coordinates are ( (1 - t)/2, (sqrt(3) t)/2 ).

We need to ensure that this point is not on any other segment from F except AB. So, for all other p (i.e., p ≠ 1/2), the point C shouldn't lie on the segment PQ corresponding to p.

Wait, but AB itself is a segment in F, right? Because AB is from (1/2, 0) to (0, sqrt(3)/2). Let's check if AB is in F.

Length of AB: sqrt( (1/2)^2 + (sqrt(3)/2)^2 ) = sqrt(1/4 + 3/4) = sqrt(1) = 1. So yes, AB is in F.

Therefore, the point C is on AB, and for all other p ≠ 1/2, C is not on the segment PQ for that p.

So, the problem reduces to finding the point C on AB such that it does not lie on any other PQ from F except AB itself.

So, to find C, we need that for all p ≠ 1/2, the point C is not on the corresponding PQ.

So, for each p ≠ 1/2, the point C cannot be expressed as (p(1 - s), sqrt(1 - p²) s) for some s in [0,1].

So, to find such a C, we need that for all p ≠ 1/2, the system of equations:

(1 - t)/2 = p(1 - s)

and

(sqrt(3) t)/2 = sqrt(1 - p²) s

has no solution (s, p) with p ≠ 1/2 and s in [0,1].

Alternatively, for C's coordinates ( (1 - t)/2, (sqrt(3) t)/2 ), the system:

(1 - t)/2 = p(1 - s)

(sqrt(3) t)/2 = sqrt(1 - p²) s

should have no solution for p ≠ 1/2.

Alternatively, for each p ≠ 1/2, the two equations should not be satisfied for any s.

So, maybe we can rephrase this by eliminating s and p.

Let me denote x = (1 - t)/2 and y = (sqrt(3) t)/2.

From the first equation, we have x = p(1 - s) => s = 1 - x/p.

From the second equation, y = sqrt(1 - p²) s.

Substitute s from
