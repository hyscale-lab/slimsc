Okay, let's try to tackle this problem. So, the task is to find the smallest integer base b (where b is at least 2) such that there are more than ten b-eautiful numbers. 

First, let me make sure I understand the problem correctly. A number n is called b-eautiful if two conditions are met:
1. When n is written in base b, it has exactly two digits.
2. The sum of these two digits equals the square root of n.

Given the example, 81 is 13-eautiful because in base 13, 81 is written as 63, and 6 + 3 equals 9, which is the square root of 81.

So, I need to figure out for each base b, how many such numbers n exist, and find the smallest b where this count exceeds ten.

Let me break down the problem. First, expressing n in base b with exactly two digits means that n can be written as a * b + c, where a and c are digits in base b. Since it's a two-digit number, a must be at least 1 (because leading zeros aren't allowed), and both a and c must be less than b.

So, n = a*b + c, where 1 ≤ a < b and 0 ≤ c < b.

The second condition is that a + c = sqrt(n). So, sqrt(n) must be an integer because a and c are integers. Therefore, n must be a perfect square. Let me denote m = sqrt(n), so m must be an integer. Therefore, n = m².

Putting it all together, m² = a*b + c, and m = a + c.

So, substituting m into the equation, we get:

m² = a*b + c
But since c = m - a, we can substitute that in:

m² = a*b + (m - a)
Simplify this equation:

m² = a*b + m - a
m² - m = a*(b - 1)
So, a = (m² - m)/(b - 1)

Since a has to be an integer (as it's a digit in base b), (m² - m) must be divisible by (b - 1). Also, a must satisfy 1 ≤ a < b, so:

1 ≤ (m² - m)/(b - 1) < b

So, let's write that as:

1 ≤ (m² - m)/(b - 1) < b

Which implies:

(m² - m)/(b - 1) ≥ 1  →  m² - m ≥ b - 1
and
(m² - m)/(b - 1) < b  →  m² - m < b*(b - 1)

So, the first inequality: m² - m ≥ b - 1 → m² - m - (b - 1) ≥ 0

The second inequality: m² - m < b² - b → m² - m - (b² - b) < 0

So, m has to satisfy both of these inequalities for some base b.

But since m² = n, and n is a two-digit number in base b, we can also find the range of m.

In base b, the smallest two-digit number is 10_b, which is b in decimal, and the largest is (b-1)(b) + (b-1) = b² - 1. So, n is between b and b² - 1.

Therefore, m = sqrt(n) is between sqrt(b) and sqrt(b² - 1). Since m must be an integer, the possible m's are integers from ceil(sqrt(b)) up to floor(sqrt(b² - 1)).

But sqrt(b² - 1) is just less than b, so m can be from ceil(sqrt(b)) up to b - 1.

Wait, let me think. For a two-digit number in base b, the maximum value is (b-1)*b + (b-1) = b² - 1. So, sqrt(b² - 1) is less than b, so the maximum m is b - 1 (since m must be integer). And the minimum m is the smallest integer greater than or equal to sqrt(b). For example, if b is a perfect square, say b = k², then sqrt(b) = k, so m starts at k. Otherwise, it starts at floor(sqrt(b)) + 1.

But for our purposes, let's just say m ranges from m_min to m_max, where m_min is the smallest integer such that m_min^2 ≥ b, and m_max is the largest integer such that m_max^2 ≤ b² - 1, which is m_max = b - 1.

So, for each base b, m can range from m_min to m_max = b - 1.

Given that, let's go back to the equation:

a = (m² - m)/(b - 1)

We need a to be an integer, and a must satisfy 1 ≤ a < b.

So, for each base b, we can iterate through each possible m from m_min to m_max, compute a, and check if a is an integer within the required range. Each valid a and c = m - a (which also must satisfy c < b) would correspond to a b-eautiful number.

But since our goal is to find the smallest b where there are more than ten such numbers, we can approach this by checking each base b starting from 2 upwards, and for each b, count how many m's result in valid a and c.

Alternatively, perhaps we can find a mathematical relationship or formula to count the number of valid m's for a given b.

Let me consider that.

Given a = (m² - m)/(b - 1)

We can write this as:

a = m*(m - 1)/(b - 1)

Since a must be an integer, (b - 1) must divide m*(m - 1).

But m and m - 1 are consecutive integers, so they are coprime. Therefore, (b - 1) must divide the product m*(m - 1). Since m and m - 1 are coprime, (b - 1) must divide either m or m - 1, or be a product of factors from each.

Wait, but because they are coprime, (b -1) must divide m or m - 1, or be a product of factors that each divide m or m - 1. However, since m and m-1 are coprime, (b - 1) can be expressed as d1*d2, where d1 divides m and d2 divides m - 1, and d1 and d2 are coprime.

But perhaps it's more straightforward to express (b - 1) as a divisor of m*(m - 1). So, for each m, the possible b's are such that (b - 1) divides m*(m - 1). But since we're trying to find for each b, the number of m's, perhaps this approach is not the most straightforward.

Alternatively, let's fix
