Okay, so I need to figure out how many positive integers n ≤ 2024 where Bob can guarantee a win in this game against Alice. Let me think through the problem step by step.

The game is between Alice and Bob. They take turns removing tokens from a stack. Alice goes first. On each turn, a player can remove either 1 or 4 tokens. The person who takes the last token wins. So, I need to find the number of n's where Bob has a winning strategy, regardless of Alice's moves.

Hmm, this sounds like a combinatorial game theory problem. I remember that these types of games can often be analyzed using the concept of "winning positions" and "losing positions." A winning position is one where the current player can force a win no matter what the opponent does, while a losing position is one where no matter what the current player does, the opponent can force a win.

So, let me try to model this. Let's denote that for a given number of tokens n, if it's Alice's turn and n is a winning position, she can win. If it's Bob's turn and n is a winning position, he can win. Wait, but since Alice goes first, the initial position is n, and if n is a winning position for the first player (Alice), then Alice can win. Conversely, if n is a losing position for the first player, then Bob can win.

Wait, no. Wait, actually, the terminology is that a position is a winning position if the current player can force a win. So, if n is a winning position, the current player (regardless of whether it's Alice or Bob) can win. So, for this problem, we need to find the n's where the starting position is a losing position for Alice, meaning Bob can win.

So, the key is to find all n ≤ 2024 where the starting position (n) is a losing position for the first player (Alice), which would make it a winning position for Bob.

Alright, let's model this. Let's define a function W(n) which is true if the current player can force a win when there are n tokens, and false otherwise.

The base cases are:
- If n = 0, the game is over, so the current player cannot make a move and thus loses. So W(0) = false.
- If n = 1, the current player can take 1 token and win. So W(1) = true.
- If n = 4, the current player can take 4 tokens and win. So W(4) = true.

For other values of n, the current player can choose to take 1 or 4 tokens. So, the current player can win if either of the following is true:
- If taking 1 token leaves the opponent in a losing position (i.e., W(n-1) = false).
- If taking 4 tokens leaves the opponent in a losing position (i.e., W(n-4) = false).

So, in general, W(n) = (not W(n-1)) OR (not W(n-4)).

Wait, no, more precisely, W(n) is true if there exists a move that leads to a losing position for the opponent. So, W(n) = (W(n-1) is false) OR (W(n-4) is false).

So, W(n) is true if either taking 1 token or 4 tokens leads to a position where the opponent cannot win.

Let me write that down as a recurrence relation:

W(n) = (not W(n-1)) OR (not W(n-4)).

So, for each n ≥ 1, W(n) is true if either W(n-1) is false or W(n-4) is false.

Let me compute the values of W(n) for small n to see if a pattern emerges.

n | W(n)
0 | F
1 | T (since n=0 is F)
2 | Let's see: n=2 can take 1, leaving n=1 (W= T). So, W(2) = not W(1) OR not W(-2). Wait, but W(-2) is undefined. So only the possible move is taking 1, which leads to W(1
