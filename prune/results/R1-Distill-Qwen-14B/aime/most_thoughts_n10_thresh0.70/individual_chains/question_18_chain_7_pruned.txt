Okay, so I've got this problem about counting the number of rectangles that can be formed inside a regular dodecagon. Each side of the rectangle has to lie on either a side or a diagonal of the dodecagon. Hmm, that's interesting. I remember that in polygons, especially regular ones, diagonals can form various shapes, but I'm not too sure about rectangles specifically.

First off, let me visualize a regular dodecagon. It's a 12-sided polygon with all sides equal and all internal angles equal. Each internal angle in a regular dodecagon is 150 degrees because the formula for internal angles is ((n-2)*180)/n, which would be ((12-2)*180)/12 = 150 degrees. Okay, that makes sense.

Now, the problem is about rectangles. Rectangles have four sides with opposite sides equal and all angles 90 degrees. So, for a shape to be a rectangle inside the dodecagon, its sides must be either sides or diagonals of the dodecagon, and the angles must be 90 degrees. 

Wait, but in a regular dodecagon, the sides and diagonals can have various lengths. So, the sides of the rectangle must be aligned along these sides or diagonals. But how do I ensure that the angles are 90 degrees? Because not every four lines in the dodecagon will form a rectangle.

I think the key here is that in a regular dodecagon, certain diagonals are perpendicular to each other. So, if two diagonals intersect at 90 degrees, they can form the sides of a rectangle. Alternatively, sides and diagonals might intersect at right angles, allowing for rectangles.

Let me try to model this. Maybe I can think about the symmetry of the dodecagon. Since it's regular, it has a lot of symmetry, so perhaps the number of rectangles can be determined by counting certain combinations of points or lines.

Hmm, another approach is to consider that any rectangle is determined by its vertices, which are vertices of the dodecagon. So, maybe I can find all sets of four points that form a rectangle. But wait, not every four points will form a rectangle. So, I need some criteria.

In a regular polygon, a rectangle can be formed if the points are symmetric with respect to the center of the polygon. So, for four points to form a rectangle, they must be such that each pair of opposite points are diametrically opposite, but considering the 12-gon, which has an even number of sides, but 12 is not a multiple of 4 in a way that each point has a diametric opposite. Wait, actually, 12 is even, so each vertex has an opposite vertex. For example, in a 12-gon, vertex 1 is opposite to vertex 7, vertex 2 is opposite to vertex 8, and so on.

Wait, but for a rectangle, you need two pairs of opposite points. So, perhaps each rectangle is determined by choosing two pairs of opposite vertices, but such that the sides between them form right angles.

Wait, no. Because if you just take any two pairs of opposite vertices, the figure might not necessarily be
