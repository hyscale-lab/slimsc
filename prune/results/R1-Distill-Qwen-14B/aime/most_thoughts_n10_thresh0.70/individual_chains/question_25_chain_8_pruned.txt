Okay, so I've got this problem here about residents in Aimeville and the things they own. Let me try to unpack it step by step. 

First, the problem says there are 900 residents. Each resident owns a bag of candy hearts, which means that's the universal set—everyone has at least one of these. Then, there are three other items: diamond rings, golf clubs, and garden spades. The numbers are 195, 367, and 562 residents respectively. 

Hmm, wait, so the total number of people who own each item is 195, 367, and 562. But then, it also mentions that each of the 900 owns a candy heart—so that's 900. But then, the problem says there are 437 residents who own exactly two of these things, and 234 who own exactly three. We need to find how many own all four.

I think this is a problem involving the principle of inclusion-exclusion. Yeah, that's right. Inclusion-exclusion helps calculate the union of multiple sets by considering their intersections. But since we're given specific numbers about exactly two and exactly three, I might need to use that to find the number who own all four.

Let me recall the inclusion-exclusion formula for four sets. The formula is:

|A ∪ B ∪ C ∪ D| = |A| + |B| + |C| + |D| - |A∩B| - |A∩C| - |A∩D| - |B∩C| - |B∩D| - |C∩D| + |A∩B∩C| + |A∩B∩D| + |A∩C∩D| + |B∩C∩D| - |A∩B∩C∩D|

But wait, since everyone owns at least a candy heart, which is D, maybe I can think of D as the universal set. So, the total union would just be 900. So,

900 = |A| + |B| + |C| + |D| - |A∩B| - |A∩C| - |A∩D| - |B∩C| - |B∩D| - |C∩D| + |A∩B∩C| + |A∩B∩D| + |A∩C∩D| + |B∩C∩D| - |A∩B∩C∩D|

But that seems complicated. Alternatively, since D is the universal set, maybe I can consider the problem only in terms of A, B, C, with D being included in all. So, perhaps the problem is about A ∪ B ∪ C, where each is a subset of D.

Wait, maybe it's better to model all four items as separate sets, but since everyone owns D (candy hearts), then the union of A, B, C, D is just 900. Hmm, that makes sense.

But I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think differently. The problem gives me the exact numbers of people owning exactly two and exactly three items. So, maybe I can use the inclusion-exclusion principle but adjust for exactly two and exactly three.

Wait, the standard inclusion-exclusion formula gives the total number of elements in the union, but when we have counts of exactly two and exactly three, we can use another approach. Let me recall that in set theory, the sum of the sizes of the individual sets is equal to the number of elements in exactly one set plus twice the number in exactly two sets plus three times those in exactly three sets plus four times those in all four sets.

Wait, that might be a useful way to model this. Let me write that down.

Let me denote:

- a = number of people owning exactly one item
- b = number owning exactly two
- c = exactly three
- d = exactly four.

We know that a + b + c + d = 900, since all residents own at least one item (the candy hearts).

We are given that b = 437 and c = 234. We need to find d.

Also, the sum of the sizes of the individual sets is |A| + |B| + |C| + |D|. Wait, but D is everyone since everyone owns a candy heart. So |D| = 900.

Wait, but the problem states that each resident owns a bag of candy hearts. So, every resident is in D. Therefore, when considering the union of A, B, C, D, it's just D, so the total is 900.

Wait, but I'm getting confused. Maybe I should model it as four sets: A (diamond rings), B (golf clubs), C (garden spades), and D (candy hearts). But since D includes everyone, D is the entire universe.

Wait, but the problem says that each resident
