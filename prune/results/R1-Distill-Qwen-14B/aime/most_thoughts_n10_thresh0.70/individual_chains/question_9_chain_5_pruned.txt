Okay, so I have this logarithm problem here. Let me try to understand it step by step. The problem says that there are real numbers x and y, both greater than 1, such that log base x of y^x equals 10, and log base y of x^{4y} also equals 10. And I need to find the product xy.

Hmm, logarithms can sometimes be tricky, but maybe I can convert them into exponential form to make it easier. Remember, log_b(a) = c means that b^c = a. So, applying that here.

First, let's take the first equation: log_x(y^x) = 10. Converting that into exponential form, it would be x^{10} = y^x. Wait, that's interesting. So x^10 equals y^x.

Similarly, the second equation is log_y(x^{4y}) = 10. Converting that as well, we get y^{10} = x^{4y}.

So now I have two equations:

1. x^{10} = y^x
2. y^{10} = x^{4y}

Hmm, both equations involve x and y in exponents. Maybe I can take logarithms again or find a way to relate them.

Let me take the natural log of both sides to make the exponents come down. Maybe that will help me solve for x and y.

Taking ln on both sides of the first equation:

ln(x^{10}) = ln(y^x)

Using the logarithm power rule, which says ln(a^b) = b*ln(a), so:

10 * ln(x) = x * ln(y)

Similarly, for the second equation:

ln(y^{10}) = ln(x^{4y})

Which becomes:

10 * ln(y) = 4y * ln(x)

Okay, so now I have two equations in terms of ln(x) and ln(y):

1. 10 ln(x) = x ln(y)
2. 10 ln(y) = 4y ln(x)

Hmm, maybe I can express one variable in terms of the other. Let me see.

From equation 1: 10 ln(x) = x ln(y). Let me solve for ln(y).

ln(y) = (10 ln(x)) / x

Similarly, from equation 2: 10 ln(y) = 4y ln(x). Let's solve for ln(x):

ln(x) = (10 ln(y)) / (4y) = (5 ln(y)) / (2y)

Wait, now I have expressions for ln(y) and ln(x) in terms of each other. Maybe I can substitute one into the other.

So, from equation 1, ln(y) is (10 ln(x))/x, and from equation 2, ln(x) is (5 ln(y))/(2y). Let me plug the expression for ln(y) from equation 1 into equation 2.

So substitute ln(y) = (10 ln(x))/x into equation 2's expression for ln(x):

ln(x) = [5*(10 ln(x)/x)] / (2y)

Simplify the numerator: 5 * 10 is 50, so:

ln(x) = (50 ln(x)) / (2x y) )

Simplify denominator: 2xy. So:

ln(x) = (50 ln(x)) / (2x y)

Wait, I can cancel ln(x) from both sides, assuming ln(x) is not zero. Since x > 1, ln(x) is positive, so it's safe to divide both sides by ln(x).

So dividing both sides by ln(x), we get:

1 = 50 / (2x y)

Simplify the right side: 50 divided by 2 is 25.

So, 1 = 25 / (x y)

Which implies that x y = 25.

Oh, wait, that's the product xy we were supposed to find! So is that it? Did I just get the answer?

Wait, let me double-check my steps because that seems too straightforward.

Starting again, the two equations after taking natural logs were:

1. 10 ln(x) = x ln(y)
2. 10 ln(y) = 4y ln(x)

From equation 1, ln(y) = (10 ln x)/x

From equation 2, ln x = (10 ln y)/(4y) = (5 ln y)/(2y)

Then substituting ln y from equation 1 into equation 2:

ln x = [5*(10 ln x / x)] / (2y) = (50 ln x)/(2x y) = (25 ln x)/(x y)

Then, dividing both sides by ln x, assuming ln x â‰  0, which it isn't because x >1.

So 1 = 25/(x y), so x y =25.

Hmm, seems correct. So xy is 25.

But wait, let me ensure that this is consistent with both equations.

Suppose that xy=25, so y =25/x.

Let me plug this into equation 1.

Equation 1: 10 ln x = x ln y

But y=25/x, so ln y = ln(25/x) = ln(25) - ln x.

So equation 1 becomes:

10 ln x = x (ln 25 - ln x)

Let's write
