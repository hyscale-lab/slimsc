Okay, so I've got this problem about a regular octagon where each vertex is colored either red or blue, each with a 50-50 chance. The question is about the probability that after coloring, we can rotate the octagon such that all the blue vertices end up where red vertices were originally. Hmm, that's a mouthful. Let me try to break it down.

First, I need to visualize a regular octagon. It has eight sides, so eight vertices. Each vertex is either red or blue, each color with equal probability, so each vertex has a 1/2 chance of being red or blue. The coloring is independent, so the color of one vertex doesn't affect the others.

Now, the problem is about rotating the octagon such that all the blue vertices end up where red vertices were. So, after rotation, every blue vertex should be on a position that was red before the rotation. That means the set of blue vertices after rotation must exactly match the set of red vertices before rotation. Wait, no, not exactly, because the octagon is being rotated, so the positions are being permuted.

Let me rephrase: We need a rotation (by some number of steps, like 0, 1, 2, ..., 7 positions) such that when we apply this rotation to the octagon, every blue vertex moves to a position that was originally red. So, the image of the blue set under this rotation must be a subset of the red set. But since we're rotating the entire octagon, the blue set gets mapped to some other set, but we need that this image is exactly the red set.

Wait, actually, the problem is phrased as "all of the blue vertices end up at positions where there were originally red vertices." So each blue vertex must move to a position that was previously red. So, the image of the blue set under the rotation must be entirely within the red set. But since we have a bijection (rotation is a permutation), the image must be exactly the red set. Because if the blue set maps to the red set, then the red set must map to the blue set under the inverse rotation. So, the condition is that there exists a rotation such that when we rotate the octagon, the blue vertices are exactly where the red ones were.

Alternatively, another way to think about it is that the set of blue vertices is a rotation of the set of red vertices. Since the octagon is regular, rotations correspond to cyclic shifts of the vertices. So, the blue set must be a cyclic shift of the red set.

But wait, since the red set is determined by the blue set (because all vertices are either red or blue), the condition is that the blue set is a rotation of the red set. So, the blue set must be a shifted version of the red set.

Wait, but in a way, if the blue set is a shifted version of the red set, then the coloring must be such that it's symmetric under some rotation. For example, if every other vertex is blue, then shifting by two positions would map blue to blue. But in this case, we have a more specific condition: the blue set must be a rotation of the red set.

Wait, perhaps it's better to model the octagon as a cyclic group. The octagon has rotational symmetry of order 8, so the
