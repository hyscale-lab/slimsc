Okay, so I've got this problem here with points O, A, and B given. O is at (0,0), A is at (1/2, 0), and B is at (0, sqrt(3)/2). The family F consists of segments PQ of unit length in the first quadrant, with P on the x-axis and Q on the y-axis. There's a unique point C on AB, not A or B, that isn't on any other segment from F except AB. I need to find OC squared, which is p/q, and then find p + q.

Hmm, okay. Let me visualize this first. O is the origin, A is halfway between O and (1,0), and B is a point on the y-axis, somewhere above (0,1) maybe? Wait, sqrt(3)/2 is approximately 0.866, so it's below (0,1). So AB is a line segment connecting (1/2, 0) to (0, sqrt(3)/2). That should form a triangle OAB, maybe an equilateral triangle? Because OA is 1/2, OB is sqrt(3)/2, and AB... Let me calculate AB's length.

Distance between A and B: sqrt[(1/2 - 0)^2 + (0 - sqrt(3)/2)^2] = sqrt[(1/4) + (3/4)] = sqrt[1] = 1. Oh, so AB is also length 1. So triangle OAB has all sides of length 1? Wait, OA is 1/2, OB is sqrt(3)/2, but AB is 1. So it's not equilateral, but maybe a 30-60-90 triangle?

Wait, O is at (0,0), A is at (1/2, 0), so OA is along the x-axis, and B is at (0, sqrt(3)/2). So triangle OAB has sides OA = 1/2, OB = sqrt(3)/2, and AB = 1. So the triangle is right-angled? Let me check the angles. At point O, the angle between OA and OB. The vectors OA are (1/2,0) and OB is (0, sqrt(3)/2). The dot product is (1/2)(0) + (0)(sqrt(3)/2) = 0. So they are perpendicular. So triangle OAB is a right-angled triangle at O with legs OA = 1/2, OB = sqrt(3)/2, and hypotenuse AB = 1.

That's a 30-60-90 triangle because the sides are 1/2, sqrt(3)/2, and 1. So angle at A is 60 degrees, angle at B is 30 degrees? Wait, no. Wait, in a 30-60-90 triangle, the sides opposite 30, 60,
