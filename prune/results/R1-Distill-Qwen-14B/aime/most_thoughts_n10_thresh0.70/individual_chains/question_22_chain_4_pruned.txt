Okay, so I've got this geometry problem here about a convex equilateral hexagon. All the opposite sides are parallel, and there's a triangle formed by extending the sides AB, CD, and EF. The sides of this triangle are 200, 240, and 300. I need to find the side length of the hexagon.

Hmm, okay. Let me try to visualize this. A convex hexagon with opposite sides parallel. Since it's equilateral, all sides are the same length, let's call that 's'. The fact that opposite sides are parallel makes me think of a hexagon that's kind of stretched but still maintains equal side lengths. Maybe something like a regular hexagon but skewed, but still with opposite sides parallel.

Now, the triangle formed by extending AB, CD, and EF. So, if I imagine extending those sides, they must meet to form a triangle. The sides of this triangle are given as 200, 240, and 300. I think the triangle is the outer triangle that encompasses the hexagon in some way.

Wait, maybe it's similar to how a regular hexagon can be inscribed in a triangle. Or perhaps it's a larger triangle with the hexagon inside it, and the hexagon's sides are parallel to the triangle's sides. But in this case, the hexagon is equilateral but not necessarily regular.

I remember that in such a hexagon, each pair of opposite sides is both equal and parallel. So, for example, AB is parallel and equal to DE, BC is parallel and equal to EF, and CD is parallel and equal to FA.

Since the hexagon is convex, all its interior angles are less than 180 degrees. Also, since all sides are equal, the hexagon is equilateral but not necessarily equiangular.

I think I need to relate the triangle's side lengths to the hexagon's side length. Maybe by looking at similar triangles or using proportions.

Wait, the triangle is formed by the extensions of AB, CD, and EF. Let me try to draw this mentally. So, if I extend AB beyond B and A, CD beyond C and D, and EF beyond E and F, these extensions meet to form a triangle. The sides of this triangle are 200, 240, and 300.

Maybe I can model this as a larger triangle with the hexagon inside it, where each side of the hexagon is a portion of the sides of this larger triangle.

Let me think about how the hexagon fits into the triangle. Since each pair of opposite sides of the hexagon is parallel, the hexagon could be thought of as a smaller, similar figure inside the larger triangle. But since it's a hexagon, it's more complicated than just a smaller triangle.

I've heard of something called the "outer triangle" and "inner hexagon" in geometry. Maybe this is an example of that. In such cases, the hexagon is formed by lines parallel to the sides of the triangle, cutting off smaller triangles from the corners.

Wait, but in this problem, the hexagon is equilateral, so each side is the same length, which would imply that the cuts made by those parallel lines are at the same distance from the sides of the triangle.
