Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the least integer base b (where b is at least 2) such that there are more than ten b-eautiful integers. Let me make sure I understand the problem correctly.

A positive integer n is called b-eautiful if two conditions are met:
1. When n is written in base b, it has exactly two digits. That means n can be expressed as a two-digit number in base b, which mathematically translates to n = a * b + c, where a and c are digits in base b. Since it's a two-digit number, a must be at least 1 and at most b-1, and c must be between 0 and b-1.
2. The sum of these two digits (a + c) equals the square root of n. So, sqrt(n) = a + c.

Given that, the example provided is 81 being 13-eautiful because 81 in base 13 is 63_13, and 6 + 3 = 9, which is sqrt(81).

My task is to find the smallest base b where there are more than ten such b-eautiful numbers. So, I need to find the minimal b such that the number of solutions (n) for the equation n = a * b + c, with a + c = sqrt(n), is greater than ten.

Let me structure my approach:

1. Express n in terms of a, b, and c. Since n has two digits in base b, n = a * b + c, where a is from 1 to b-1, and c is from 0 to b-1. Also, since a and c are digits, each is less than b.

2. The second condition gives us a + c = sqrt(n). Let's square both sides to eliminate the square root: (a + c)^2 = n.

3. But n is also a * b + c. So, substituting, we get (a + c)^2 = a * b + c.

4. Let me write this equation again: (a + c)^2 = a * b + c.

5. Let's rearrange this equation. Expanding the left side:
(a + c)^2 = a² + 2ac + c² = a*b + c.

So, a² + 2ac + c² = a*b + c.

Bring all terms to one side:
a² + 2ac + c² - a*b - c = 0.

Hmm, maybe we can rearrange terms to group some variables. Let's see:

a² + 2ac + c² - a*b - c = 0.

Let me try to group terms with a and c:

a² + (2c - b) * a + c² - c = 0.

This is a quadratic equation in terms of a. Let me write it as:

a² + (2c - b) a + (c² - c) = 0.

Since a must be an integer between 1 and b-1, for each c, we can solve for a.

Alternatively, perhaps I can approach it differently. Let's consider that n is a perfect square because sqrt(n) is an integer (since a and c are integers, their sum is an integer, so n must be a perfect square). So, n = k², where k is a positive integer.

Given that, the two-digit representation in base b is n = a * b + c, and a + c = k.

So, substituting n with k², we get k² = a * b + c.

But since a + c = k, we can write c = k - a.

Substituting c into the equation:

k² = a * b + (k - a).

Simplify:

k² = a*b + k - a.

Let's rearrange terms:

k² - k = a*b - a.

Factor a on the right side:

k² - k = a*(b - 1).

So,

a = (k² - k)/(b - 1).

Since a must be a digit in base b, it must satisfy 1 ≤ a ≤ b - 1, and c = k - a must satisfy 0 ≤ c ≤ b - 1.

So, for each base b, the possible values of a are determined by the integer solutions of a = (k² - k)/(b - 1), where k is such that a and c are digits.

But since a must be an integer, (k² - k) must be divisible by (b - 1). Therefore, (b - 1) must be a divisor of (k² - k) for some k.

Alternatively, for a given b, I can iterate over possible k values and see when (k² - k) is divisible by (b - 1) and whether the resulting a is within the valid range, and then check if c = k - a is also a valid digit.

But my goal is to find the minimal b for which there are more than ten such n's. Each n corresponds to a specific a, b, c, and k. So, for each base b, I need to count how many k's satisfy the condition that (k² - k) is divisible by (b - 1), and a and c are within their respective digit ranges.

Let me think about how to model this.

Given that, perhaps I can model the problem as follows:

For a given base b, let D = b - 1.

We need to find the number of integers k such that:

1. k² - k is divisible by D, i.e., D | (k² - k).
2. a = (k² - k)/D must satisfy 1 ≤ a ≤ D.
3. c = k - a must satisfy 0 ≤ c ≤ D.

So, for each D, which is b - 1, we can find the number of k's that satisfy the above conditions.

Our task is to find the minimal D + 1 (since b = D + 1) such that the number of k's is greater than 10.

So, perhaps I can rephrase the problem: find the minimal D ≥ 1 such that there are more than ten integers k satisfying:

1. k² - k ≡ 0 mod D
2. 1 ≤ (k² - k)/D ≤ D
3. 0 ≤ k - (k² - k)/D ≤ D

Wait, that's a bit messy, but maybe manageable.

Alternatively, perhaps we can think of k in terms of the divisors of D.

Since D | (k² - k), that implies that k(k - 1) must be divisible by D.

So, k(k - 1) ≡ 0 mod D.

Since k and k - 1 are consecutive integers, they are coprime. So, D must divide the product of two consecutive integers.

Which means that D can be expressed as a product of factors, each of which divides one of k or k - 1.

But since k and k -1 are coprime, the factors of D must be distributed between k and k -1.

So, D can be written as D = d1 * d2, where d1 divides k and d2 divides k-1, and gcd(d1, d2) = 1.

Hmm, but perhaps that's complicating things.

Alternatively, since D divides k(k - 1), the number of solutions k modulo D is equal to the number of solutions to k(k - 1) ≡ 0 mod D.

Which, since k and k-1 are coprime, this equation holds if and only if k ≡ 0 mod d or k ≡ 1 mod d, where d is any divisor of D.

Wait, no, that's not exactly correct. The equation k(k-1) ≡ 0 mod D implies that k ≡ 0 mod p^e for each prime power p^e dividing D, or k ≡ 1 mod p^e.

But because D can have multiple prime factors, the number of solutions is 2^m, where m is the number of distinct prime factors of D, but with some caveats because of overlapping solutions.

Wait, maybe that's an overcomplication. Let me think.

Each prime power in D must divide either k or k - 1.

Therefore, for each prime power p^e dividing D, k must be ≡ 0 mod p^e or k ≡ 1 mod p^e.

Therefore, the number of solutions k modulo D is 2^t, where t is the number of distinct prime factors of D.

Wait, but this is only true if D is square-free. If D has higher exponents, like p^e with e > 1, then for each such p^e, k must be ≡ 0 mod p^e or ≡ 1 mod p^e.

So, for each prime power in D's factorization, we have two choices: k ≡ 0 or 1 mod p^e.

Thus, the total number of solutions modulo D is 2^{number of distinct prime factors in D}.

Wait, no, because for each prime power, whether it's p or p^e, it's still considered as one factor. So, for example, if D = p^a * q^b, then the number of solutions is 2^2 = 4.

Wait, let's take D=6=2*3. The solutions modulo 6 would be k ≡ 0 mod 2 and 0 mod 3, or 0 mod 2 and 1 mod 3, or 1 mod 2 and 0 mod 3, or 1
