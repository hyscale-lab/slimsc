Okay, so I'm trying to solve this problem where I have 25 white chips and 25 black chips. I need to place some of them on a 5x5 grid, following certain conditions. Let me try to break down the problem step by step.

First, the conditions:

1. Each cell can have at most one chip. So, no two chips can be in the same cell.
2. All chips in the same row must be the same color. Similarly, all chips in the same column must be the same color.
3. The placement should be such that adding any additional chip would violate the first two conditions. So, it's a maximal arrangement.

Hmm, so each row and each column must be uniformly colored if they have any chips. But also, once placed, any additional chip would break either the row or column uniformity or exceed the cell capacity.

Wait, so if a row has chips, all of them must be the same color, and similarly for columns. But that means, for example, if a row has white chips, then all the cells in that row are either white or empty. But wait, no—wait, the condition is that all chips in the same row have the same color. So, if a row has some chips, all those chips must be the same color, but the empty cells can be anything? No, wait, no, because if a column has chips, all those must be the same color. So, if a cell is in both a row with chips and a column with chips, the color must be consistent.

So, actually, the grid can be partitioned into rows and columns where each row is either all white, all black, or empty, but with the added constraint that if a row has a color, then all the cells in that row must be of that color, unless the column they are in doesn't have that color. Wait, no, that might complicate things.

Wait, perhaps a better way is to model the grid as a matrix where each row is either white, black, or empty, and each column is either white, black, or empty. But the colors of the rows and columns must be consistent. For example, if row i is white and column j is black, then cell (i,j) cannot have a chip because it's in a white row and a black column—so that cell must be empty. But if row i is white and column j is white, then cell (i,j)
