Okay, so I have this problem here: Let ω ≠ 1 be a 13th root of unity. I need to find the remainder when the product from k=0 to 12 of (2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k}) is divided by 1000. Hmm, that seems a bit complicated, but maybe I can break it down.

First, I remember that roots of unity have some nice properties. Since ω is a 13th root of unity, ω^13 = 1, and ω^k for k=0,1,...,12 are all distinct. Also, the minimal polynomial for ω is the 13th cyclotomic polynomial, which is Φ₁₃(x) = x¹² + x¹¹ + ... + x + 1. Wait, no, actually Φ₁₃(x) is x¹² + x¹¹ + ... + x + 1, right? Because the cyclotomic polynomial for prime n is Φₙ(x) = x^{n-1} + ... + x + 1.

So, the product given is ∏_{k=0}^{12} (2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k}). I need to compute this product. Maybe I can express this product in terms of polynomials evaluated at certain points.

I know that products over roots of unity can sometimes be related to evaluating polynomials at specific roots. Let me think: for cyclotomic polynomials, the product over (x - ω^k) for k=0 to 12 is x¹³ - 1, but since ω ≠ 1, maybe we have to adjust for that.

Wait, but in this case, the product is over (2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k}), which looks a bit different. Maybe I can factor this expression or relate it to a known polynomial.

Let me consider each term: 2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k}. Let me set z = ω^k. Then each term becomes 2 - 2z + z². So, the product becomes ∏_{z^13=1, z≠1} (2 - 2z + z²). Wait, but when k=0, z=ω^0=1, which would be included in the product? So actually, the product is over all 13th roots of unity, including z=1.

So, the product is ∏_{z^13=1} (2 - 2z + z²). Hmm, this seems promising because then it's a product over all roots of z¹³ - 1. So, perhaps I can think of this as evaluating a certain polynomial at a specific value.

If I have a polynomial P(z) = z² - 2z + 2, and I want the product of P(z) for all z such that z¹³ = 1. But wait, that's exactly the product of P(z) over all 13th roots of unity.

I remember that the product of a polynomial evaluated at all roots of another polynomial can be related to the resultant
