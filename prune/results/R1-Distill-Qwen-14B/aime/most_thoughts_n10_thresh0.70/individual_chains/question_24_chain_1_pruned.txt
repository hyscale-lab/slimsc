Okay, I need to solve this math problem. Let me read it carefully.

We have a list of positive integers with three properties:

1. The sum is 30.
2. The unique mode is 9.
3. The median is a positive integer that doesn't appear in the list.

We need to find the sum of the squares of all the items in the list. The final answer should be an integer inside a box.

Hmm, let's break this down. First, let's recall some definitions.

- **Mode**: The number that appears most frequently. Since it's the unique mode, 9 must appear more times than any other number.
- **Median**: The middle value when the numbers are arranged in order. If the number of elements is odd, it's the middle one. If even, it's the average of the two middle ones. But here, the median is a positive integer not in the list. That's interesting.

Alright, let's denote the list as a sorted list: a₁ ≤ a₂ ≤ ... ≤ aₙ.

First, the sum is 30. So, a₁ + a₂ + ... + aₙ = 30.

Second, the mode is 9, unique. So, 9 appears more than any other number. Let's say it appears k times, and all other numbers appear less than k times.

Third, the median is an integer not in the list. Since the median is either one of the middle numbers (if odd count) or the average of two (if even). But in this case, it's an integer, so if the count is even, the average must be an integer but not present in the list.

Wait, if the list has an odd number of elements, the median is the middle element, which must be an integer not in the list. But that's impossible because the median is an element of the list. So, that can't be. Therefore, the list must have an even number of elements. Because if it's even, the median is the average of the two middle numbers, which can be an integer not present.

So, n must be even. Let me confirm that logic.

If n is odd, median is a single element, which is in the list, but the problem says the median is a positive integer that does not appear in the list itself. So, n cannot be odd. Therefore, n must be even.

So, n is even. Let me denote n=2m, so the median is (a_m + a_{m+1}) / 2, which must be an integer not in the list.

So, a_m + a_{m+1} must be even, so their sum is divisible by 2, and the median is (sum)/2.

But the median is not in the list, so (a_m + a_{m+1}) / 2 is not equal to any a_i.

Since all a_i are integers, a_m and a_{m+1} must be both even or both odd to make the sum even.

Also, since the list is sorted, a_m ≤ a_{m+1}.

Given all that, let's start thinking about the structure of the list.

We need to have 9 as the unique mode, so it must appear more times than any other number. Let me denote the number of times 9 appears as t. So, t ≥ 2, because it's a mode (appears more than others).

Wait, actually, the minimum number of times the mode can appear is one more than the maximum frequency of any other number. So, if other numbers appear at most s times, then t ≥ s + 1.

But for the list of positive integers, we can start by trying to structure the list with as many 9s as possible, but also considering the median and sum constraints.

Let me think about the minimal number of elements. To minimize n, we can have as many 9s as possible because they contribute more to the sum. But since the median is an integer not in the list, the list can't have that median, so perhaps 9 is not the median?

Wait, but 9 is the mode, so it must appear more than any other number. So, perhaps the median is somewhere else.

Let me try to construct a possible list.

Let’s assume n=8. Because with 8 elements, the median is the average of the 4th and 5th elements. Let me see.

Wait, but n=8, so the sum is 30. Let me think about the minimal sum with 8 elements. The minimal sum would be 1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1=8, which is way less than 30. So, we can have higher numbers.

But let's try to structure the list. Let me suppose that the number of 9s is t. Since 9 is the mode, t must be greater than the count of any other number. So, other numbers can appear at most t-1 times.

Let me try t=4.

So, if t=4, then 9 appears four times. The other numbers can appear at most 3 times.

But let's check if this is feasible.

Number of elements: 4 (for 9s) + sum of other elements' counts.

But wait, the total number of elements is n=2m. Let's see.

Wait, perhaps I should first decide on n.

Wait, perhaps n is 6? Let's test with n=6.

If n=6, then the median is (a3 + a4)/2, which must be an integer not present in the list. So, a3 + a4 must be even.

Also, the sum is 30, and the mode is 9 with the highest frequency.

Let me assume t=
