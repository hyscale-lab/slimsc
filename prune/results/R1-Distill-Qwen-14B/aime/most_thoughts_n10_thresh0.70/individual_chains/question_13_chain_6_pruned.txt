Okay, so I've got this math problem here, and I'm going to try to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again and understand what's being asked.

Every morning, Aya goes for a 9-kilometer-long walk and stops at a coffee shop afterwards. When she walks at a constant speed of s kilometers per hour, the walk takes her 4 hours, including t minutes spent in the coffee shop. When she walks s+2 kilometers per hour, the walk takes her 2 hours and 24 minutes, including t minutes spent in the coffee shop. Now, they want to know how many minutes the walk takes her if she walks at s + 1/2 kilometers per hour, including the t minutes spent in the coffee shop.

Hmm. So, we're given two scenarios with different speeds and different total times, both including a coffee stop of t minutes. We need to find the total time when her speed is s + 1/2 km/h.

Let me break this down. First, when she walks at speed s, the total time is 4 hours, which includes both the walking time and the coffee stop time. Similarly, when she walks faster at s+2, the total time is 2 hours and 24 minutes, again including the coffee stop.

Wait, so the total time is the time she spends walking plus the time she spends at the coffee shop. So, maybe I can set up equations for each scenario.

Let me denote:

- Distance walked: 9 km
- Speed: s km/h in the first case, s+2 km/h in the second case.
- Time taken to walk: let's call it t_walk1 in the first case and t_walk2 in the second case.
- Total time: 4 hours and 2 hours 24 minutes respectively, which includes t minutes at the coffee shop.

Wait, but 4 hours is 240 minutes, and 2 hours 24 minutes is 144 minutes. But maybe it's better to work in hours for the speed calculations because speed is in km per hour.

Wait, so let me convert the times:

- 4 hours is 4 hours.
- 2 hours 24 minutes is 2 + 24/60 = 2.4 hours.

But wait, 24 minutes is 0.4 hours, because 24/60 = 0.4.
