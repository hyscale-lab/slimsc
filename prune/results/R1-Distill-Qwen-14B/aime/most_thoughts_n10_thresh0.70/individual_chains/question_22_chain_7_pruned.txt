Okay, so I have this problem about a convex equilateral hexagon where all pairs of opposite sides are parallel. The triangle formed by extending AB, CD, and EF has sides of lengths 200, 240, and 300. I need to find the side length of the hexagon.

First, let me try to visualize this. A convex hexagon with opposite sides parallel and all sides equal. So, it's like a regular hexagon but maybe stretched or compressed in certain directions. Since it's equilateral, all sides are the same length, but they can be at different angles as long as opposite sides are parallel.

The triangle formed by extending sides AB, CD, and EF is given. Hmm, so AB, CD, and EF are three sides of the hexagon, each opposite to another side. If I extend these, they form a triangle with sides 200, 240, and 300. I need to relate this triangle to the hexagon's side length.

Since the hexagon is convex and equilateral with opposite sides parallel, I think it might be similar to a regular hexagon scaled in some way. But the triangle formed by extending these sides complicates things.

Wait, maybe I can use similar triangles or some ratio of sides. Let me think. If I extend AB, CD, and EF, they meet at some points forming a larger triangle. The sides of this triangle are 200, 240, 300. I wonder if this triangle is similar to the hexagon's structure.

In a regular hexagon, opposite sides are parallel, and the extensions of these sides would meet at points forming a larger equilateral triangle. But in this case, the triangle isn't equilateral; it's scalene with sides 200, 240, 300. So, maybe the hexagon isn't regular but is stretched in some direction.

I remember that in such hexagons, the sides can be thought of as vectors. Since all sides are equal in length and opposite sides are parallel, the hexagon can be thought of as a translation of a smaller hexagon scaled up by some factor.

Wait, another approach: using the concept of similar triangles and the ratios of the sides. If the triangle formed by the extensions has sides 200, 240, 300, then perhaps each side of the hexagon is proportional to a part of these sides.

Let me consider the triangle. Suppose the triangle is ABC, with AB=200, BC=240, and AC=300. Wait, no, actually, the triangle is formed by the extensions of AB, CD, and EF. So perhaps each side of the triangle is composed of two segments: one from the hexagon and one extension.

Wait, maybe the hexagon is similar to the triangle but scaled down. Let me think about how the sides relate.

Suppose that the extensions of AB, CD, and EF form a triangle. Let's denote the triangle as T with sides t1=200, t2=240, t3=300. Each side of triangle T corresponds to the extensions of AB, CD, EF.

If the hexagon is such that each side is of length '
