Okay, so I have this geometry problem here. Let me try to parse it step by step.

We have triangle ABC inscribed in a circle ω. The tangents to ω at points B and C intersect at point D. Then, the line AD intersects ω again at point P. We're given the lengths AB = 5, BC = 9, and AC = 10. We need to find the length AP, express it as a reduced fraction m/n, and then compute m + n.

First, let me visualize this setup. Triangle ABC with sides 5, 9, 10. So it's definitely a scalene triangle. The circle ω is the circumcircle of triangle ABC. The tangents at B and C meet at D; so D is the ex-pole or something? Wait, tangents from D touch the circle at B and C, so D is the ex-pole with respect to BC. That makes D the ex-tangent point or something. So, D is the intersection of the two tangents.

Then, AD is drawn, and it intersects the circumcircle again at P. So, starting from A, going through D, and intersecting the circle again at P. So, point P is diametrically opposite? No, not necessarily. It depends on where D is.

I need to find AP. Hmm.

I remember that when dealing with tangents and power of a point, the power of point D with respect to ω is DB² = DC² since both are tangents from D to ω. So, D has equal power with respect to ω, which is DB² = DC².

Power of a point: if D is outside the circle, then DB² = DC² = DA * DP. Wait, no. Wait, AD is a secant that intersects the circle at A and P. So, power of D with respect to ω is DB² = DA * DP.

Yes, that's right. So, DB² = DA * DP. So, if I can compute DB, and then express DP in terms of DA, or vice versa, maybe I can find AP.

But I don't know DB yet. Hmm. So, maybe I should compute the length of DB first.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use coordinates or trigonometry. Let me see.

Given the sides of triangle ABC, perhaps I can compute some key elements like the circumradius, the coordinates of the points, then find D, then compute AD and figure out where it intersects the circle again.

Alternatively, maybe using inversion, but that might be complicated. Maybe using triangle similarities or Ceva's theorem?

Wait, another approach: use harmonic division or projective geometry. Since tangents are involved, perhaps there's some harmonic properties here.

Wait, let me try to proceed step by step.

First, given triangle ABC with sides AB=5, BC=9, AC=10. Let me compute the circumradius R of triangle ABC because maybe that will help.

To compute R, I can use the formula:

R = (a*b*c)/(4*Δ)

where a, b, c are the sides, and Δ is the area.

So, let's compute Δ using Heron's formula.

First, compute the semi-perimeter s:

s = (5 + 9 + 10)/2 = (24)/2 = 12.

Then, Δ = sqrt(s(s - a)(s - b)(s - c)) = sqrt(12*(12 -5)(12-9)(12-10)) = sqrt(12*7*3*2).

Compute that: 12*7=84, 84*3=252, 252*2=504. So sqrt(504).

Simplify sqrt(504): 504 = 16 * 31.5 → Wait, 504 = 16 * 31.5? Let me factor it.

504 divided by 2 is 252,
