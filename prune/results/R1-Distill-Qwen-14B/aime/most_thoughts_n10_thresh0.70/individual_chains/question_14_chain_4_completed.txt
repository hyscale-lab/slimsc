Okay, let's try to tackle this problem. So, the question is about finding the greatest four-digit number N with a specific property. The property is that if you change any one of its digits to 1, the resulting number is divisible by 7. Then, after finding N, we need to compute Q + R where Q is the quotient and R is the remainder when N is divided by 1000.

Hmm, let me break this down. So, N is a four-digit number, which means it's between 1000 and 9999. We need the greatest such number, so we're probably looking near the upper end of that range.

The main property is that changing any single digit to 1 makes the number divisible by 7. So, for N = ABCD (where A, B, C, D are digits), changing A to 1 gives a number divisible by 7, changing B to 1 also does, changing C to 1, and changing D to 1. So, all four possibilities must satisfy the divisibility condition.

Since we're looking for the greatest such N, it makes sense that we should start checking from 9999 downwards until we find a number that satisfies the condition. But that might take a long time manually, so maybe there's a smarter way.

Let me think about how changing a digit affects the number's divisibility by 7. Divisibility by 7 is a bit tricky because there's no straightforward rule like for 3 or 9. One method is to take the last digit, double it, subtract it from the rest of the number, and see if the result is divisible by 7. But I'm not sure if that's helpful here.

Alternatively, maybe we can model the problem mathematically. Let's represent N as a four-digit number: N = 1000a + 100b + 10c + d, where a, b, c, d are digits from 0 to 9, and a ≠ 0 since it's a four-digit number.

Now, when we change any digit to 1, the new number must be divisible by 7. Let's consider each case:

1. Changing the thousands digit (a) to 1: The new number becomes 1000*1 + 100b + 10c + d = 1000 + 100b + 10c + d. Let's denote this as N1.

2. Changing the hundreds digit (b) to 1: The new number is 1000a + 100*1 + 10c + d = 1000a + 100 + 10c + d. Denote as N2.

3. Changing the tens digit (c) to 1: The new number is 1000a + 100b + 10*1 + d = 1000a + 100b + 10 + d. Denote as N3.

4. Changing the units digit (d) to 1: The new number is 1000a + 100b + 10c + 1. Denote as N4.

Each of these N1, N2, N3, N4 must be divisible by 7.

So, mathematically, we can write:

1. N1 ≡ 0 mod 7 ⇒ (1000 + 100b + 10c + d) ≡ 0 mod 7
2. N2 ≡ 0 mod 7 ⇒ (1000a + 100 + 10c + d) ≡ 0 mod 7
3. N3 ≡ 0 mod 7 ⇒ (1000a + 100b + 10 + d) ≡ 0 mod 7
4. N4 ≡ 0 mod 7 ⇒ (1000a + 100b + 10c + 1) ≡ 0 mod 7

Also, the original number N = 1000a + 100b + 10c + d must be as large as possible. So, we want a, b, c, d to be as large as possible, but we have these constraints.

Let me note that 1000 ≡ k mod 7. Let me compute 1000 mod 7.

Calculating 1000 /7: 7*142=994, so 1000-994=6. So, 1000 ≡6 mod7.

Similarly, 100 mod7: 7*14=98, so 100-98=2, so 100≡2 mod7.

10 mod7=3, 1 mod7=1.

So, let's compute each condition modulo7.

1. N1 = 1000 + 100b + 10c + d ≡6 + 2b + 3c + d ≡0 mod7
2. N2 = 1000a + 100 + 10c + d ≡6a + 2 + 3c + d ≡0 mod7
3. N3 = 1000a + 100b + 10 + d ≡6a + 2b + 3 + d ≡0 mod7
4. N4 = 1000a + 100b + 10c + 1 ≡6a + 2b + 3c +1 ≡0 mod7

So, we have four congruence equations:

1. 6 + 2b + 3c + d ≡0 mod7 ...(1)
2. 6a + 2 + 3c + d ≡0 mod7 ...(2)
3. 6a + 2b + 3 + d ≡0 mod7 ...(3)
4. 6a + 2b + 3c +1 ≡0 mod7 ...(4)

And our goal is to find a, b, c, d (digits) that satisfy all four, with N=1000a+100b+10c+d as large as possible.

Hmm, this seems a bit complex. Let me see if I can find relationships between these equations.

Let me subtract equation (4) from equation (1):

Equation (1) - Equation (4):

(6 + 2b + 3c + d) - (6a + 2b + 3c +1) ≡0 -0 mod7

Simplify:

6 + 2b + 3c + d -6a -2b -3c -1 ≡ (6-1) + (2b-2b) + (3c-3c) + d -6a ≡5 + d -6a ≡0 mod7

So, 5 + d -6a ≡0 mod7 ⇒ d ≡6a -5 mod7 ...(A)

Similarly, let's subtract equation (4) from equation (2):

Equation (2) - Equation (4):

(6a +2 +3c +d) - (6a +2b +3c +1) ≡0 -0 mod7

Simplify:

6a +2 +3c +d -6a -2b -3c -1 ≡ (2-1) + (3c-3c) + (d -2b) + (6a-6a) ≡1 + d -2b ≡0 mod7

So, 1 + d -2b ≡0 mod7 ⇒ d ≡2b -1 mod7 ...(B)

Similarly, subtract equation (4) from equation (3):

Equation (3) - Equation (4):

(6a +2b +3 +d) - (6a +2b +3c +1) ≡0 -0 mod7

Simplify:

6a +2b +3 +d -6a -2b -3c -1 ≡(3-1) + (2b-2b) + (d -3c) + (6a-6a)≡2 + d -3c ≡0 mod7

So, 2 + d -3c ≡0 mod7 ⇒ d ≡3c -2 mod7 ...(C)

So now, from equations (A), (B), (C), we have expressions for d in terms of a, b, c.

So,

d ≡6a -5 mod7 ...(A)

d ≡2b -1 mod7 ...(B)

d ≡3c -2 mod7 ...(C)

So, these three must all be congruent to the same d mod7.

So, 6a -5 ≡2b -1 mod7

and 6a -5 ≡3c -2 mod7

Let me write these two congruences.

First: 6a -5 ≡2b -1 mod7

Simplify: 6a -2b ≡ (-5 +1) mod7 ⇒6a -2b ≡-4 mod7 ⇒6a -2b ≡3 mod7 (because -4 ≡3 mod7)

Similarly, second congruence: 6a -5 ≡3c -2 mod7

Simplify: 6a -3c ≡-5 +2 mod7 ⇒6a -3c ≡-3 mod7 ⇒6a -3c ≡4 mod7 (since -3 ≡4 mod7)

So, now we have:

1. 6a -2b ≡3 mod7 ...(D)

2. 6a -3c ≡4 mod7 ...(E)

Let me see if I can express b and c in terms of a.

From equation (D): 6a -2b ≡3 mod7

Let me write it as: -2b ≡3 -6a mod7 ⇒2b ≡6a -3 mod7

Multiply both sides by 4 (since 2 and 7 are coprime, the inverse of 2 mod7 is 4 because 2*4=8≡1 mod7)

So, b ≡4*(6a -3) ≡24a -12 mod7

Simplify 24 mod7: 24 /7=3*7=21, 24-21=3 ⇒24≡3 mod7

-12 mod7: -12 +14=2 ⇒-12≡2 mod7

So, b ≡3a +2 mod7 ...(F)

Similarly, equation (E):6a -3c ≡4 mod7

Let me write as: -3c ≡4 -6a mod7 ⇒3c ≡6a -4 mod7

Multiply both sides by 5 (since 3*5=15≡1 mod7, so 5 is the inverse of 3 mod7)

c ≡5*(6a -4) mod7

Compute 5*6a=30a, 5*(-4)=-20

30a mod7: 30 /7=4*7=28, 30-28=2 ⇒30a≡2a mod7

-20 mod7: -20 +21=1 ⇒-20≡1 mod7

Thus, c≡2a +1 mod7 ...(G)

So now, from (F) and (G), we have:

b ≡3a +2 mod7

c ≡2a +1 mod7

Since b and c are digits, their values must be between 0 and 9. So, let's note that.

Also, from (A), (B), (C), and the expressions for d, we can express d in terms of a, b, or c.

Let me try to find d in terms of a.

From (A): d ≡6a -5 mod7

Since d is a digit (0-9), d can be written as d = (6a -5) mod7 + 7k, where k is 0 or 1 to make d between 0-9.

Wait, actually, mod7 gives a value from 0-6, so d can be either (6a -5) mod7 or (6a -5) mod7 +7, but since d is a digit (0-9), and (6a -5) mod7 can be 0-6, adding 7 would give 7-13, but since d is a digit, the maximum is 9, so if (6a -5) mod7 is 0-4, adding 7 would make d 7-11, but 11 is not allowed, so perhaps if (6a -5) mod7 is 0-2, d could be either that or that +7, but 3-6 would require d=3-6 or 10-13, but 10-13 are invalid. So perhaps it's better to compute d directly.

But maybe we can find a relation between a, b, c, d such that all are digits and satisfy the congruences.

Given that, perhaps we can express b and c in terms of a, and then d in terms of a, then try to find a suitable a that makes all digits valid.

Given that, let's proceed step by step.

Since we're trying to maximize N, which is 1000a +100b +10c +d, we want a to be as large as possible (preferably 9), then b, c, d as large as possible.

But let's see.

Let me assume a=9, the maximum possible, and see if it's possible.

So, a=9.

From (F): b ≡3a +2 mod7 ⇒3*9 +2=27 +2=29 ⇒29 mod7.

29 /7=4*7=28, so 29-28=1 ⇒b≡1 mod7.

Since b is a digit (0-9), possible values for b are 1 and 8 (1+7=8). But we want to maximize N, so b should be as large as possible. So, choose b=8.

From (G): c ≡2a +1 mod7 ⇒2*9+1=18 +1=19 ⇒19 mod7=19-14=5 ⇒c≡5 mod7.

So, possible c values are 5 and 12, but 12 is invalid. So c=5.

Now, from (A): d ≡6a -5 mod7 ⇒6*9=54, 54-5=49 ⇒49 mod7=0 ⇒d≡0 mod7.

So, d can be 0 or 7. Since d is a digit, and we want to maximize N, we choose d=7.

So, for a=9, we have b=8, c=5, d=7.

So, N=9857.

Now, we need to check whether changing each digit to 1 gives a number divisible by 7.

Let me compute N1, N2, N3, N4.

N1: change a to 1: 1857.

Check if 1857 is divisible by 7.

Compute 1857 ÷7: 7*265=1855, 1857-1855=2. So, 1857=7*265 +2. So, remainder 2. Not divisible by 7. So, this N=9857 doesn't satisfy the condition. So, a=9 is invalid.

Hmm, that's a problem. So, perhaps a=9 is too large, but maybe a=9 is possible if our earlier assumption is wrong? Or maybe I made a mistake in the calculations.

Wait, let's double-check the calculations for a=9.

a=9.

From (F): b ≡3*9 +2 =27+2=29≡1 mod7. So, b=1 or 8. We chose b=8 to maximize.

From (G): c≡2*9 +1=19≡5 mod7. So, c=5.

From (A): d≡6*9 -5=54-5=49≡0 mod7. So, d=0 or 7. We chose d=7.

So, N=9857.

Now, N1=1857. Let's compute 1857 ÷7: as above, 7*265=1855, 1857-1855=2 ⇒1857≡2 mod7. So, not divisible. So, N1 is not divisible by 7, which violates the condition. So, N=9857 is invalid.

So, a=9 doesn't work. So, we need to try a=8.

So, a=8.

From (F): b≡3*8 +2=24+2=26≡5 mod7 (since 26-21=5). So, b≡5 mod7. Possible b=5,12,19,... but since b is a digit, only 5 and 12→12 invalid, so b=5. But wait, wait, 3a +2=26, which is 26 mod7=5. So, b≡5 mod7. So, the maximum possible b is 5 +7=12, which is invalid, so b=5 is the only option. But wait, can b be 5 or 12? Since b is a digit, 12 is invalid, so b=5.

Wait, but wait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let me think.

Wait, 26 mod7 is 5, so b can be 5 or 12, but 12 is invalid. So, the maximum value of b is 5. But since we're trying to maximize N, we want the largest possible b. So, b=5 is the only option. Hmm.

But wait, maybe I should think again. If b≡5 mod7, then the possible b digits are 5 and 12, but since 12 is invalid, only b=5. So, in this case, b=5.

From (G): c≡2*8 +1=17≡3 mod7 (17-14=3). So, c≡3 mod7. So, possible c=3 or 10, but 10 is invalid, so c=3.

From (A): d≡6*8 -5=48-5=43≡1 mod7 (43-42=1). So, d≡1 mod7. So, possible d=1 or 8 (1+7=8). Since we want to maximize N, choose d=8.

So, N=8 5 3 8 →8538.

Now, check if changing each digit to 1 gives a number divisible by7.

Compute N1: change a to1: 1538. Check if 1538 is divisible by7.

Compute 1538 /7: 7*219=1533, 1538-1533=5 ⇒1538≡5 mod7. Not divisible. So, N1 is invalid. So, N=8538 is invalid.

Hmm, so a=8 also doesn't work. Let's try a=7.

a=7.

From (F): b≡3*7 +2=21 +2=23≡2 mod7 (23-21=2). So, b≡2 mod7. Possible b=2,9 (2+7=9). Since we want maximum b, choose b=9.

From (G): c≡2*7 +1=14 +1=15≡1 mod7 (15-14=1). So, c≡1 mod7. So, possible c=1 or 8 (1+7=8). To maximize, choose c=8.

From (A): d≡6*7 -5=42-5=37≡2 mod7 (37-35=2). So, d≡2 mod7. Possible d=2 or 9. Choose d=9 to maximize.

So, N=7989.

Check if changing each digit to1 gives a number divisible by7.

N1: change a to1: 1989.

Check 1989 ÷7. 7*284=1988, 1989-1988=1 ⇒1989≡1 mod7. Not divisible. So, invalid.

So, a=7 doesn't work.

Proceeding to a=6.

a=6.

From (F): b≡3*6 +2=18 +2=20≡6 mod7 (20-14=6). So, b≡6 mod7. Possible b=6,13. But 13 is invalid, so b=6.

From (G): c≡2*6 +1=12 +1=13≡6 mod7 (13-7=6). So, c≡6 mod7. Possible c=6 or 13. 13 invalid, so c=6.

From (A): d≡6*6 -5=36-5=31≡3 mod7 (31-28=3). So, d≡3 mod7. Possible d=3 or 10. 10 invalid, so d=3.

So, N=6 6 6 3 →6663.

Check N1: change a to1: 1663.

1663 ÷7: 7*237=1659, 1663-1659=4 ⇒1663≡4 mod7. Not divisible. So, N=6663 invalid.

Hmm, moving on to a=5.

a=5.

From (F): b≡3*5 +2=15 +2=17≡3 mod7 (17-14=3). So, b≡3 mod7. Possible b=3,10. 10 invalid, so b=3.

From (G): c≡2*5 +1=10 +1=11≡4 mod7 (11-7=4). So, c≡4 mod7. Possible c=4,11. 11 invalid, so c=4.

From (A): d≡6*5 -5=30-5=25≡4 mod7 (25-21=4). So, d≡4 mod7. Possible d=4 or11. 11 invalid, so d=4.

Thus, N=5 3 4 4 →5344.

Check N1: change a to1: 1344.

1344 ÷7: 7*192=1344. So, 1344 is divisible by7. Good.

Now, check N2: change b to1: 5144.

5144 ÷7: 7*734=5138, 5144-5138=6 ⇒5144≡6 mod7. Not divisible. So, invalid.

Thus, N=5344 invalid.

Proceeding to a=4.

a=4.

From (F): b≡3*4 +2=12+2=14≡0 mod7. So, b≡0 mod7. Possible b=0,7. To maximize, choose b=7.

From (G): c≡2*4 +1=8 +1=9≡2 mod7 (9-7=2). So, c≡2 mod7. Possible c=2,9. Choose c=9.

From (A): d≡6*4 -5=24-5=19≡5 mod7 (19-14=5). So, d=5 or12. 12 invalid, so d=5.

Thus, N=4 7 9 5 →4795.

Check N1: change a to1: 1795.

1795 ÷7: 7*256=1792, 1795-1792=3 ⇒1795≡3 mod7. Not divisible. So, invalid.

So, a=4 invalid.

Proceeding to a=3.

a=3.

From (F): b≡3*3 +2=9+2=11≡4 mod7 (11-7=4). So, b≡4 mod7. Possible b=4,11. 11 invalid, so b=4.

From (G): c≡2*3 +1=6+1=7≡0 mod7. So, c≡0 mod7. Possible c=0,7. Choose c=7.

From (A): d≡6*3 -5=18-5=13≡6 mod7 (13-7=6). So, d≡6 mod7. Possible d=6,13. 13 invalid, so d=6.

Thus, N=3 4 7 6 →3476.

Check N1: change a to1: 1476.

1476 ÷7: 7*210=1470, 1476-1470=6 ⇒1476≡6 mod7. Not divisible. So, invalid.

Proceeding to a=2.

a=2.

From (F): b≡3*2 +2=6+2=8≡1 mod7. So, b≡1 mod7. Possible b=1,8. Choose b=8.

From (G): c≡2*2 +1=4+1=5≡5 mod7. So, c=5.

From (A): d≡6*2 -5=12-5=7≡0 mod7. So, d=0 or7. Choose d=7.

Thus, N=2 8 5 7 →2857.

Check N1: change a to1: 1857.

1857 ÷7: 7*265=1855, 1857-1855=2 ⇒1857≡2 mod7. Not divisible. So, invalid.

Proceeding to a=1.

a=1.

From (F): b≡3*1 +2=3+2=5≡5 mod7. So, b=5 or12. 12 invalid, so b=5.

From (G): c≡2*1 +1=2+1=3≡3 mod7. So, c=3 or10. 10 invalid, so c=3.

From (A): d≡6*1 -5=6-5=1≡1 mod7. So, d=1 or8. Choose d=8.

Thus, N=1 5 3 8 →1538.

Check N1: change a to1: same as original, 1538. Wait, but original a is 1, so changing a to1 doesn't change the number. But the condition says "whenever one of its digits is changed to 1". So, perhaps for a=1, changing a to1 is the same number. So, we need to ensure that N itself is divisible by7? Because in that case, if N is already 1538, which is 1538. Let me check if 1538 is divisible by7.

1538 ÷7: 7*219=1533, 1538-1533=5 ⇒1538≡5 mod7. So, not divisible. So, even if a=1, N isn't divisible by7, so this doesn't satisfy the condition.

Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding. The problem says, if you change any one digit to1, the resulting number is divisible by7. So, if the digit is already1, changing it to1 again doesn't change the number. So, the original number N must be divisible by7 as well, because if you change a digit that's already1 to1, the number remains the same, so N must be divisible by7.

Wait, that's an important point. So, in the case where a=1, since changing a to1 doesn't change N, N must be divisible by7.

But in our earlier calculation for a=1, N=1538 is not divisible by7, so it's invalid.

Wait, but for a=9, when we changed a to1, we got 1857 which wasn't divisible by7, but N=9857 itself, is it divisible by7? Let's check.

9857 ÷7: 7*1408=9856, 9857-9856=1 ⇒9857≡1 mod7. So, not divisible. So, to satisfy the condition, N itself must be divisible by7 because when you change a digit that's already1 to1, the number remains N, so N must be divisible by7.

Wait, that changes things. So, in addition to the four conditions, we also have N ≡0 mod7.

So, N=1000a +100b +10c +d ≡0 mod7.

Which, as we computed earlier, N mod7 is (6a + 2b + 3c +d) mod7.

So, 6a +2b +3c +d ≡0 mod7.

Wait, but earlier, when we derived the conditions, we had equation (4): 6a +2b +3c +1≡0 mod7. So, that's when d is changed to1. So, N4=6a +2b +3c +1≡0 mod7.

But the original N is 6a +2b +3c +d≡0 mod7. So, the original N must be ≡0 mod7.

So, combining with equation (4):

From (4): 6a +2b +3c +1≡0 mod7 ⇒6a +2b +3c≡-1 mod7.

From N: 6a +2b +3c +d≡0 mod7 ⇒ (6a +2b +3c) +d ≡0 mod7.

Substituting from equation (4): (-1) +d ≡0 mod7 ⇒d≡1 mod7.

So, d≡1 mod7. So, from equation (A), which was d=6a-5 mod7, and equation (B) d=2b-1 mod7, and (C) d=3c-2 mod7.

But from this new consideration, we have d≡1 mod7.

So, let's see.

From (A): d ≡6a -5 mod7.

But d≡1 mod7 ⇒6a -5 ≡1 mod7 ⇒6a ≡6 mod7 ⇒a≡1 mod7 (since 6 is invertible mod7, 6*6=36≡1 mod7, so multiply both sides by6: a≡6*6=36≡1 mod7).

So, a≡1 mod7. Since a is a digit from1-9, possible a=1 or8.

So, a can be1 or8.

Earlier, when a=8, N=8538, but when we checked, N1 wasn't divisible by7. But now, knowing that d≡1 mod7, perhaps we need to adjust our earlier approach.

Wait, this is a crucial point. So, from the original N being divisible by7, we get d≡1 mod7. So, let's correct our earlier approach.

So, from equation (A): d=6a -5 mod7.

But since d≡1 mod7, we have 6a -5 ≡1 mod7 ⇒6a≡6 mod7 ⇒a≡1 mod7.

Thus, a=1 or8.

So, possible a=8 or1.

We tried a=9 earlier, but since a must be1 or8, let's proceed with a=8 and a=1.

So, let's retry with a=8, considering d≡1 mod7.

Wait, but earlier, when a=8, we had:

From (F): b≡3*8 +2=26≡5 mod7 ⇒b≡5.

From (G): c≡2*8 +1=17≡3 mod7 ⇒c≡3.

From (A): d≡6*8 -5=48-5=43≡1 mod7 ⇒d≡1 ⇒d=1 or8. Since d must be ≡1 mod7, d=1 or8.

Wait, but earlier, when a=8, we set d=8 to maximize N. But according to this, d must be ≡1 mod7, so d=1 or8.

Wait, so when a=8, d can be1 or8. Let's choose d=8 to maximize N.

So, N=8 b c 8.

From (F): b=5 or12. But b must be a digit, so b=5.

From (G): c=3 or10. 10 invalid, so c=3.

So, N=8 5 3 8 →8538.

Now, check if changing any digit to1 makes the number divisible by7.

N1: change a to1: 1538. Check 1538 ÷7.

As before, 7*219=1533, 1538-1533=5 ⇒1538≡5 mod7. Not divisible. So, invalid.

But wait, according to our earlier conclusion, a must be ≡1 mod7, so a=1 or8.

But with a=8, N=8538, which didn't satisfy the condition. So, perhaps a=8 is invalid.

Wait, but earlier, when a=8, d=8, which is ≡1 mod7 (since 8 mod7=1). So, that's correct.

But N1=1538 is not divisible by7. So, problem.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the earlier calculations. Let me re-examine.

Wait, when a=8, d=8.

So, N=8538.

Check N1: change a to1: 1538.

1538 ÷7: Let me compute 7*219=1533, 1538-1533=5 ⇒1538≡5 mod7. Not divisible.

So, N1 is invalid.

So, a=8 doesn't work. Let's try a=1.

a=1.

From (F): b≡3*1 +2=5 mod7 ⇒b=5 or12. 12 invalid, so b=5.

From (G): c≡2*1 +1=3 mod7 ⇒c=3 or10. 10 invalid, so c=3.

From (A): d≡6*1 -5=1 mod7 ⇒d=1 or8. Choose d=8 to maximize.

So, N=1 5 3 8 →1538.

Now, check if changing any digit to1 makes the number divisible by7.

N1: change a to1: same as N, which is 1538. So, check if 1538 is divisible by7.

1538 ÷7=219.714..., as before, 7*219=1533, 1538-1533=5 ⇒1538≡5 mod7. So, not divisible.

Thus, N=1538 invalid.

Hmm, this is confusing. Both a=8 and a=1 lead to numbers where N1 isn't divisible by7. But according to our earlier analysis, a must be1 or8 because d≡1 mod7.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the earlier step where I concluded that d≡1 mod7.

Let me re-examine that.

We have N ≡0 mod7.

From equation (4): N4=6a +2b +3c +1≡0 mod7.

From N: 6a +2b +3c +d≡0 mod7.

Subtracting equation (4) from N: (6a +2b +3c +d) - (6a +2b +3c +1) = d -1 ≡0 mod7 ⇒d≡1 mod7.

Ah, so d≡1 mod7.

So, d must be ≡1 mod7, i.e., d=1 or8.

So, with that, let's try a=8 again.

a=8.

From (F): b≡3*8 +2=26≡5 mod7 ⇒b=5.

From (G): c≡2*8 +1=17≡3 mod7 ⇒c=3.

From (A): d≡6*8 -5=43≡1 mod7 ⇒d=1 or8. Choose d=8.

So, N=8 5 3 8 →8538.

Check N1: change a to1: 1538. 1538 ÷7=219*7=1533, 1538-1533=5 ⇒1538≡5 mod7. Not divisible.

So, invalid.

Wait, perhaps I need to adjust the digits so that N1 is divisible by7. Maybe choosing b or c differently?

Wait, but from (F) and (G), b and c are determined by a. So, when a=8, b=5 and c=3 are fixed. So, perhaps there's no way around it. So, N=8538 is invalid.

Similarly, for a=1, N=1538 is invalid.

Hmm, this suggests that a=1 and a=8 are the only possibilities, but neither works. So, perhaps there's a mistake in our earlier approach.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that when a=8, d=1 instead of8. Let me try that.

So, a=8, d=1.

Then, N=8 5 3 1 →8531.

Check N1: change a to1:1531.

1531 ÷7: 7*218=1526, 1531-1526=5 ⇒1531≡5 mod7. Still not divisible.

Hmm, same issue.

Wait, perhaps I need to adjust other digits. But from our earlier analysis, b and c are fixed once a is chosen. So, perhaps the problem is that for a=8 and a=1, no such number exists, so we have to look for other a's.

Wait, but earlier we concluded that a must be ≡1 mod7, i.e., a=1 or8. But perhaps this is incorrect.

Wait, let's go back to the step where we had d≡1 mod7 and equation (A): d=6a-5 mod7.

So, 6a -5 ≡1 mod7 ⇒6a ≡6 mod7 ⇒a≡1 mod7, since 6 is invertible.

But 6a≡6 mod7 ⇒a≡1 mod7, because 6*1=6≡6 mod7, and 6*8=48≡6 mod7 (since 48-42=6). So, a can be1 or8.

So, our earlier conclusion was correct.

But both a=1 and a=8 don't work. So, perhaps the problem is that our initial assumption is wrong, or maybe we need to consider that d can be 1 or8, but also perhaps N itself must be divisible by7, which adds another condition.

Alternatively, perhaps the maximum N is not with a=9 or8, but lower.

Wait, perhaps I should try a=7, but a must be≡1 mod7, so a=7 is not allowed. So, only a=1 and8 are allowed.

Hmm, this is perplexing. Let me think differently.

Perhaps I should consider that when changing a digit to1, the resulting number must be divisible by7, but the original number N doesn't have to be divisible by7. Wait, but earlier we saw that when a=1, changing a to1 leaves N unchanged, so N must be divisible by7. Similarly, if any digit is already1, changing it to1 doesn't change N, so N must be divisible by7.

But in our earlier analysis, when a=8, d=8≡1 mod7, but N=8538 is not divisible by7. So, perhaps our earlier approach is missing something.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that when a=8, d=8, but d≡1 mod7, which is correct, but N=8538 is not divisible by7. So, perhaps we need to adjust other digits to satisfy N≡0 mod7.

But from our earlier approach, b and c are determined by a, so perhaps it's impossible.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the earlier steps. Let me re-examine.

We have:

From equation (4): 6a +2b +3c +1≡0 mod7.

From N: 6a +2b +3c +d≡0 mod7.

Subtracting, we get d≡1 mod7.

So, d=1 or8.

From equation (A): d=6a -5 mod7.

So, 6a -5 ≡d mod7.

But d≡1 mod7 ⇒6a ≡6 mod7 ⇒a≡1 mod7.

So, a=1 or8.

So, with a=8:

From (F): b≡3*8 +2=26≡5 mod7 ⇒b=5.

From (G): c≡2*8 +1=17≡3 mod7 ⇒c=3.

From (A): d=6*8 -5=43≡1 mod7 ⇒d=1 or8.

So, d=1 or8.

Thus, for a=8, b=5, c=3, d=1 or8.

So, N is either 8531 or8538.

Check N=8538:

N=8538.

Check N1: change a to1:1538. 1538 ÷7=219*7=1533, 1538-1533=5 ⇒1538≡5 mod7. Not divisible.

Check N=8531:

N=8531.

Change a to1:1531. 1531 ÷7=218*7=1526, 1531-1526=5 ⇒1531≡5 mod7. Not divisible.

So, neither works.

Hmm, perhaps a=8 is impossible. So, try a=1.

a=1.

From (F): b≡3*1 +2=5 mod7 ⇒b=5.

From (G): c≡2*1 +1=3 mod7 ⇒c=3.

From (A): d=6*1 -5=1 mod7 ⇒d=1 or8. Choose d=8.

So, N=1538.

Check N1: change a to1: same as N=1538. So, check if 1538 is divisible by7. As before, 1538≡5 mod7. Not divisible.

So, invalid.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing something. Maybe when a=8, b=5, c=3, d=1, but N=8531 isn't valid, but maybe another combination where d=1 but other digits are adjusted.

But from our earlier analysis, b and c are determined by a, so for a=8, b=5, c=3.

So, perhaps there's no solution with a=8 or1. So, perhaps the next step is to consider that our initial approach is missing something.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem requires that all four modified numbers are divisible by7, but the original N doesn't have to be. But earlier, when a=1, changing a to1 leaves N unchanged, so N must be divisible by7.

Wait, perhaps the problem doesn't require N itself to be divisible by7, only the modified numbers. Let me re-read the problem.

"The last line of your response should be your integer answer within \boxed{}.

Let $N$ be the greatest four-digit positive integer with the property that whenever one of its digits is changed to $1$, the resulting number is divisible by $7$."

So, the problem says that changing any digit to1 results in a number divisible by7. So, if a digit is already1, changing it to1 again doesn't change the number, so N itself must be divisible by7.

So, N must be divisible by7, and all four modified numbers must be divisible by7.

So, in addition to the four conditions, we have N≡0 mod7.

But from equation (4): 6a +2b +3c +1≡0 mod7.

From N: 6a +2b +3c +d≡0 mod7.

Subtracting, we get d≡1 mod7.

So, d=1 or8.

So, our earlier conclusion holds.

But with a=8, d=1 or8, but neither works. So, perhaps there's no solution with a=8, and we have to look for a lower a.

Wait, but a must be≡1 mod7, so a=1 or8.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that our earlier approach is too restrictive. Maybe we need to allow for other possibilities where a isn't ≡1 mod7, but that would mean that d isn't ≡1 mod7, but from the condition that N must be divisible by7, d must be≡1 mod7.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the earlier steps. Let me try to re-examine.

Wait, perhaps I can approach this problem differently. Let's consider that when any digit is changed to1, the number is divisible by7. So, for each digit, changing it to1 gives a number divisible by7.

So, for N=abcd:

- Changing a to1: 1bcd ≡0 mod7.
- Changing b to1: a1cd ≡0 mod7.
- Changing c to1: ab1d ≡0 mod7.
- Changing d to1: abc1 ≡0 mod7.

So, four conditions.

Additionally, N itself must be divisible by7, because if you change a digit that's already1 to1, the number remains N, so N must be divisible by7.

So, N ≡0 mod7.

So, we have five conditions.

Let me represent N as 1000a +100b +10c +d.

We can write each condition as:

1. 1000 + 100b +10c +d ≡0 mod7 ⇒(1000 mod7) + (100b mod7) + (10c mod7) +d ≡0 mod7.

We already computed 1000 mod7=6, 100 mod7=2, 10 mod7=3, 1 mod7=1.

So,

1. 6 + 2b +3c +d ≡0 mod7 ...(1)
2. 6a + 2 +3c +d ≡0 mod7 ...(2)
3. 6a +2b +3 +d ≡0 mod7 ...(3)
4. 6a +2b +3c +1 ≡0 mod7 ...(4)
5. 6a +2b +3c +d ≡0 mod7 ...(5)

From equation (5) and (4), we have:

6a +2b +3c +d ≡0 mod7 ...(5)

6a +2b +3c +1 ≡0 mod7 ...(4)

Subtracting (4) from (5): d -1 ≡0 mod7 ⇒d≡1 mod7.

So, d=1 or8.

From equation (1):6 +2b +3c +d ≡0 mod7.

Since d≡1 mod7, substitute d=1:

6 +2b +3c +1 ≡0 mod7 ⇒7 +2b +3c ≡0 mod7 ⇒2b +3c ≡-7 mod7 ⇒2b +3c ≡0 mod7.

So, 2b +3c ≡0 mod7 ...(6)

Similarly, from equation (2):6a +2 +3c +d ≡0 mod7.

Substitute d=1:

6a +2 +3c +1 ≡0 mod7 ⇒6a +3c +3 ≡0 mod7 ⇒6a +3c ≡-3 mod7 ⇒6a +3c ≡4 mod7 ...(7)

From equation (3):6a +2b +3 +d ≡0 mod7.

Substitute d=1:

6a +2b +3 +1 ≡0 mod7 ⇒6a +2b +4 ≡0 mod7 ⇒6a +2b ≡-4 mod7 ⇒6a +2b ≡3 mod7 ...(8)

From equation (4):6a +2b +3c +1 ≡0 mod7 ⇒6a +2b +3c ≡6 mod7 ...(9)

Now, from equation (7):6a +3c ≡4 mod7.

Multiply both sides by2:12a +6c ≡8 mod7 ⇒12a mod7=5a, 6c mod7=6c, 8 mod7=1.

So, 5a +6c ≡1 mod7 ...(10)

From equation (6):2b +3c ≡0 mod7 ...(6)

From equation (8):6a +2b ≡3 mod7 ...(8)

Let me try to solve these equations.

From equation (8):6a +2b ≡3 mod7.

Let me write this as:2b ≡3 -6a mod7 ⇒b ≡ (3 -6a)*4 mod7, since 2*4=8≡1 mod7.

So, b ≡ (12 -24a) mod7.

Simplify:

12 mod7=5, 24a mod7=3a (since 24=3*7 +3 ⇒24≡3 mod7).

So, b ≡5 -3a mod7.

Similarly, from equation (6):2b +3c ≡0 mod7.

We can substitute b from above.

So, 2*(5 -3a) +3c ≡0 mod7 ⇒10 -6a +3c ≡0 mod7.

10 mod7=3, -6a mod7= (-6 mod7)*a=1a (since -6≡1 mod7).

So, 3 +a +3c ≡0 mod7 ⇒a +3c ≡-3 mod7 ⇒a +3c ≡4 mod7 ...(11)

From equation (7):6a +3c ≡4 mod7.

Let me write this as:3c ≡4 -6a mod7 ⇒c ≡ (4 -6a)*5 mod7, since 3*5=15≡1 mod7.

So, c≡(20 -30a) mod7.

Simplify:

20 mod7=6, 30a mod7=2a (since 30=4*7 +2 ⇒30≡2 mod7).

So, c≡6 -2a mod7 ...(12)

Now, from equation (11):a +3c ≡4 mod7.

Substitute c from equation (12):

a +3*(6 -2a) ≡4 mod7 ⇒a +18 -6a ≡4 mod7.

Simplify:

18 mod7=4, so:

a +4 -6a ≡4 mod7 ⇒-5a +4 ≡4 mod7 ⇒-5a ≡0 mod7 ⇒5a ≡0 mod7.

Since 5 and7 are coprime, this implies a≡0 mod7.

But a is a digit from1-9, so a=7.

Wait, this is a new conclusion. Earlier, we thought a must be≡1 mod7, but now we're getting a≡0 mod7.

This suggests a contradiction, which means I must have made a mistake in the earlier steps.

Wait, let's re-examine the steps.

From equation (8):6a +2b ≡3 mod7.

We found b≡5 -3a mod7.

From equation (6):2b +3c ≡0 mod7.

Substituting b: 2*(5-3a) +3c ≡0 mod7 ⇒10 -6a +3c ≡0 mod7.

10 mod7=3, -6a mod7= a (since -6≡1 mod7).

So, 3 +a +3c ≡0 mod7 ⇒a +3c ≡-3 mod7 ⇒a +3c ≡4 mod7 ...(11)

From equation (7):6a +3c ≡4 mod7.

Let me write equation (7) as: 3c ≡4 -6a mod7 ⇒c≡(4 -6a)*5 mod7 (since 3*5=15≡1 mod7).

So, c≡(20 -30a) mod7.

20 mod7=6, 30a mod7=2a (since 30≡2 mod7).

So, c≡6 -2a mod7 ...(12)

Now, substitute c into equation (11):

a +3*(6 -2a) ≡4 mod7 ⇒a +18 -6a ≡4 mod7.

Simplify:

18 mod7=4, so:

a +4 -6a ≡4 mod7 ⇒-5a +4 ≡4 mod7 ⇒-5a ≡0 mod7 ⇒5a ≡0 mod7.

Since 5 and7 are coprime, this implies a≡0 mod7.

But a is a digit from1-9, so a=7.

So, a=7.

Now, let's compute the other variables.

From equation (12):c≡6 -2a mod7 ⇒c≡6 -14 mod7 ⇒c≡6 -0 mod7 (since 14≡0 mod7) ⇒c≡6 mod7.

So, c=6 or13. But c is a digit, so c=6.

From equation (11):a +3c ≡4 mod7 ⇒7 +3*6=7+18=25≡4 mod7 (25-21=4). So, correct.

From equation (8):6a +2b ≡3 mod7 ⇒6*7=42≡0 mod7, so 0 +2b ≡3 ⇒2b≡3 mod7 ⇒b≡5 mod7 (since 2*5=10≡3 mod7).

So, b=5 or12. 12 invalid, so b=5.

From equation (2):6a +3c +3 ≡0 mod7 ⇒6*7=42≡0, 3c=18≡4 mod7, so 0 +4 +3=7≡0 mod7. Correct.

From equation (6):2b +3c ≡0 mod7 ⇒2*5=10≡3, 3*6=18≡4 ⇒3+4=7≡0 mod7. Correct.

From equation (4):6a +2b +3c +1 ≡0 mod7 ⇒6*7=0,2*5=10≡3,3*6=18≡4 ⇒0+3+4 +1=8≡1 mod7. Wait, 8 mod7=1≡0? No, this is 1≡0 mod7, which is incorrect.

Wait, that can't be right. So, there's a mistake here.

Wait, equation (4):6a +2b +3c +1 ≡0 mod7.

Substituting a=7, b=5, c=6:

6*7=42≡0 mod7,

2*5=10≡3 mod7,

3*6=18≡4 mod7,

So, 0 +3 +4 +1=8≡1 mod7≠0. So, this is a problem.

Hmm, so our earlier conclusion that a=7 is correct, but equation (4) isn't satisfied. So, perhaps there's a mistake in the earlier steps.

Alternatively, perhaps a=7, but with different values for b and c.

Wait, let's check equation (4):

6a +2b +3c +1 ≡0 mod7.

We have a=7, b=5, c=6.

So, 6*7=42≡0,

2*5=10≡3,

3*6=18≡4,

So, 0+3+4 +1=8≡1 mod7. Not 0. So, invalid.

So, our earlier approach is flawed.

Perhaps we need to consider that d≡1 mod7, but also that equation (4) must be satisfied.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in equation (4). Let me re-express equation (4):

From the problem, changing d to1: N4=6a +2b +3c +1 ≡0 mod7.

So, equation (4):6a +2b +3c +1 ≡0 mod7.

From equation (5):6a +2b +3c +d ≡0 mod7.

Subtracting (4) from (5): d -1 ≡0 mod7 ⇒d≡1 mod7.

So, d=1 or8.

Now, with a=7, let's see if we can find b and c such that all equations are satisfied.

From equation (1):6 +2b +3c +d ≡0 mod7.

Since d=1, equation (1):6 +2b +3c +1 ≡0 ⇒7 +2b +3c ≡0 ⇒2b +3c ≡0 mod7 ...(6)

From equation (2):6a +2 +3c +d ≡0 mod7 ⇒6*7=42≡0, 0 +2 +3c +1 ≡0 ⇒3 +3c ≡0 ⇒3c ≡-3 mod7 ⇒3c≡4 mod7 ⇒c≡(4)*5 mod7 (since 3*5=15≡1) ⇒c≡20 mod7 ⇒c≡6 mod7.

So, c=6 or13. c=6.

From equation (6):2b +3c ≡0 mod7 ⇒2b +18 ≡0 mod7 ⇒2b +4 ≡0 mod7 ⇒2b≡-4≡3 mod7 ⇒b≡5 mod7.

So, b=5 or12. b=5.

From equation (3):6a +2b +3 +d ≡0 mod7 ⇒6*7=0, 2*5=10≡3, 0 +3 +3 +1=7≡0 mod7. Correct.

From equation (4):6a +2b +3c +1 ≡0 mod7 ⇒0 +3 +4 +1=8≡1 mod7. Not 0. Problem.

So, equation (4) isn't satisfied, which suggests that our approach is missing something.

Alternatively, perhaps when a=7, d=8 instead of1, but d≡1 mod7, so d=8≡1 mod7.

So, let's set d=8.

Now, equation (1):6 +2b +3c +8 ≡0 mod7 ⇒14 +2b +3c ≡0 mod7 ⇒0 +2b +3c ≡0 mod7 ⇒2b +3c ≡0 mod7 ...(6)

Equation (2):6a +2 +3c +d ≡0 mod7 ⇒6*7=0, 0 +2 +3c +8=10 +3c ≡3 +3c mod7 ⇒3 +3c ≡0 mod7 ⇒3c≡-3≡4 mod7 ⇒c≡(4)*5=20≡6 mod7. So, c=6.

From equation (6):2b +3*6=2b +18≡2b +4≡0 mod7 ⇒2b≡-4≡3 mod7 ⇒b≡5 mod7. So, b=5.

From equation (3):6a +2b +3 +d ≡0 mod7 ⇒0 +10 +3 +8=21≡0 mod7. Correct.

From equation (4):6a +2b +3c +1 ≡0 mod7 ⇒0 +10 +18 +1=29≡1 mod7 (29-28=1). Not 0.

So, still, equation (4) isn't satisfied.

Hmm, perhaps a=7 isn't the solution. So, perhaps the only way is to accept that there's no solution for a=7, and thus the problem is more complex.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that when a=7, d=1, but then equation (4) isn't satisfied, but perhaps I made a mistake in the earlier steps.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that the problem is designed so that N is 8538, but it's invalid, so perhaps the correct N is lower.

Alternatively, perhaps I should try to find N=8538 and see if there's a way to adjust digits to satisfy the conditions.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that when a=7, b=5, c=6, d=8.

So, N=7568.

Check if changing any digit to1 gives a number divisible by7.

N1: change a to1:1568.

1568 ÷7=224 ⇒1568=7*224 ⇒divisible by7.

N2: change b to1:7168.

7168 ÷7: 7*1024=7168 ⇒divisible by7.

N3: change c to1:7518.

7518 ÷7: 7*1074=7518 ⇒divisible by7.

N4: change d to1:7561.

7561 ÷7: 7*1080=7560, 7561-7560=1 ⇒7561≡1 mod7. Not divisible.

So, N4 isn't divisible by7. So, invalid.

Hmm, so close yet so far.

Wait, perhaps I can adjust d to be1 instead of8.

So, N=7561.

Check N1: change a to1:1561.

1561 ÷7: 7*223=1561 ⇒divisible by7.

N2: change b to1:7161.

7161 ÷7: 7*1023=7161 ⇒divisible by7.

N3: change c to1:7511.

7511 ÷7: 7*1073=7511 ⇒divisible by7.

N4: change d to1: same as N=7561, which is divisible by7.

So, all four modified numbers are divisible by7, and N=7561 is divisible by7.

Wait, but N=7561 is a four-digit number, and it's the largest we've found so far.

Wait, but earlier we tried a=7, and found N=7561. So, perhaps this is the answer.

But wait, earlier when a=7, we had b=5, c=6, d=1.

So, N=7561.

Check all conditions:

- Change a to1:1561 ÷7=223 ⇒divisible.

- Change b to1:7161 ÷7=1023 ⇒divisible.

- Change c to1:7511 ÷7=1073 ⇒divisible.

- Change d to1:7561 ÷7=1080.142... Wait, 7*1080=7560, 7561-7560=1 ⇒7561≡1 mod7. Not divisible.

Wait, but earlier I thought N=7561 is divisible by7, but that's incorrect. So, N4 isn't divisible by7.

So, N=7561 invalid.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let me recheck.

7561 ÷7: 7*1080=7560, 7561-7560=1 ⇒7561≡1 mod7. So, not divisible.

So, N=7561 invalid.

Hmm, this is getting frustrating. Perhaps the correct approach is to find N=8538, even though N1 isn't divisible by7, but perhaps I made a mistake in the earlier calculation.

Wait, let me recheck N=8538.

N1: change a to1:1538.

1538 ÷7: 7*219=1533, 1538-1533=5 ⇒1538≡5 mod7. Not divisible.

So, invalid.

Wait, perhaps the answer is N=8538, but it's invalid. Alternatively, maybe the answer is lower.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that the maximum N is 8538, but it's invalid, so the next possible is 8531, which is also invalid.

Alternatively, perhaps I should look for N=8538 but with d=1 instead of8.

So, N=8531.

Check N1: change a to1:1531.

1531 ÷7=218*7=1526, 1531-1526=5 ⇒1531≡5 mod7. Not divisible.

So, invalid.

Hmm, perhaps the problem requires a=8 and d=1, but with different b and c.

But from our earlier analysis, b and c are determined by a=8, so b=5, c=3.

So, perhaps there's no solution with a=8, and the maximum N is with a=7, but that also didn't work.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that when a=7, b=5, c=6, d=8, and N=7568.

Check all modified numbers:

N1:1568 ÷7=224 ⇒divisible.

N2:7168 ÷7=1024 ⇒divisible.

N3:7518 ÷7=1074 ⇒divisible.

N4:7561 ÷7=1080.142... ⇒not divisible.

So, invalid.

Wait, but N=7568 is divisible by7?

7568 ÷7=1081.142... No, 7*1081=7567, 7568-7567=1 ⇒7568≡1 mod7. So, N isn't divisible by7.

Thus, invalid.

Wait, perhaps I'm stuck here. Maybe the answer is N=8538, even though it doesn't satisfy the condition, but perhaps I made a mistake.

Alternatively, perhaps the answer is N=8538, and the problem requires that, even though changing a to1 gives 1538, which isn't divisible by7, but perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, let me recheck 1538 ÷7.

7*219=1533, 1538-1533=5 ⇒1538≡5 mod7. Not divisible.

So, invalid.

Wait, perhaps the answer is N=8538, but with different b and c.

But from our earlier analysis, b and c are determined by a=8, so b=5, c=3.

So, perhaps the problem is designed such that N=8538 is the answer, even though it doesn't satisfy the condition. But that can't be.

Alternatively, perhaps the answer is N=8538, and I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that when a=8, b=5, c=3, d=1, and N=8531.

Check N1:1531 ÷7=218*7=1526, 1531-1526=5 ⇒≡5 mod7. Not divisible.

So, invalid.

Hmm, perhaps the problem is designed such that the answer is N=8538, and the condition is that changing any digit to1 results in a number divisible by7, but N itself doesn't have to be. But earlier, we saw that when a=1, N must be divisible by7.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the problem doesn't require N itself to be divisible by7, only the modified numbers. Let me re-read the problem.

"The last line of your response should be your integer answer within \boxed{}.

Let $N$ be the greatest four-digit positive integer with the property that whenever one of its digits is changed to $1$, the resulting number is divisible by $7$."

So, the problem doesn't explicitly state that N itself must be divisible by7, only that changing any digit to1 results in a number divisible by7.

So, perhaps N doesn't have to be divisible by7. So, our earlier conclusion that d≡1 mod7 was incorrect.

Wait, but when a digit is1, changing it to1 doesn't change the number, so the resulting number must be divisible by7. So, if a digit is1, then N must be divisible by7.

But in our problem, we're trying to find N where changing any digit to1 results in a number divisible by7. So, if any digit is1, then N must be divisible by7.

But in our earlier approach, we considered that d≡1 mod7, but perhaps that's not necessary unless d is1.

Wait, perhaps I should not assume that d must be≡1 mod7, but rather that if d is changed to1, then N4 must be divisible by7. So, equation (4):6a +2b +3c +1≡0 mod7.

But N itself doesn't have to be divisible by7 unless one of its digits is already1.

So, perhaps the earlier conclusion that d≡1 mod7 was incorrect. Let me re-examine.

From equation (4):6a +2b +3c +1≡0 mod7.

But N itself doesn't have to be divisible by7 unless one of its digits is1. So, if none of the digits are1, then N doesn't have to be divisible by7.

But in our problem, we're changing each digit to1, so for each digit position, if the original digit is1, then N must be divisible by7.

But since we want the greatest N, perhaps it's better to have digits as large as possible, avoiding1s.

So, perhaps the digits a, b, c, d are not1, so that changing any digit to1 will result in a number divisible by7, but N itself doesn't have to be divisible by7.

So, in that case, our earlier conclusion that d≡1 mod7 is incorrect.

So, let's abandon the earlier conclusion that d≡1 mod7 and start fresh.

So, we have four conditions:

1. 6 +2b +3c +d ≡0 mod7 ...(1)
2. 6a +2 +3c +d ≡0 mod7 ...(2)
3. 6a +2b +3 +d ≡0 mod7 ...(3)
4. 6a +2b +3c +1 ≡0 mod7 ...(4)

We need to find a, b, c, d (digits) such that all four are satisfied, with N=1000a +100b +10c +d as large as possible.

Let me try to express these equations in terms of each other.

From equation (4):6a +2b +3c ≡-1 mod7.

From equation (1):6 +2b +3c +d ≡0 ⇒2b +3c +d ≡-6 ≡1 mod7.

From equation (2):6a +2 +3c +d ≡0 ⇒6a +3c +d ≡-2 ≡5 mod7.

From equation (3):6a +2b +3 +d ≡0 ⇒6a +2b +d ≡-3 ≡4 mod7.

Now, let me write these as:

Equation (1):2b +3c +d ≡1 mod7 ...(1a)

Equation (2):6a +3c +d ≡5 mod7 ...(2a)

Equation (3):6a +2b +d ≡4 mod7 ...(3a)

Equation (4):6a +2b +3c ≡6 mod7 ...(4a)

Now, let's try to solve these equations.

From equation (1a):d ≡1 -2b -3c mod7 ...(1b)

From equation (2a):6a +3c +d ≡5 mod7. Substitute d from (1b):

6a +3c + (1 -2b -3c) ≡5 mod7 ⇒6a +3c +1 -2b -3c ≡5 ⇒6a -2b +1 ≡5 ⇒6a -2b ≡4 mod7 ...(5)

From equation (3a):6a +2b +d ≡4 mod7. Substitute d from (1b):

6a +2b +1 -2b -3c ≡4 ⇒6a +1 -3c ≡4 ⇒6a -3c ≡3 mod7 ...(6)

From equation (4a):6a +2b +3c ≡6 mod7.

Now, we have:

Equation (5):6a -2b ≡4 mod7 ...(5)

Equation (6):6a -3c ≡3 mod7 ...(6)

Equation (4a):6a +2b +3c ≡6 mod7 ...(4a)

Let me try to solve equations (5) and (6) for a and c.

From equation (5):6a -2b ≡4 mod7.

From equation (6):6a -3c ≡3 mod7.

Let me subtract equation (6) from equation (5):

(6a -2b) - (6a -3c) ≡4 -3 mod7 ⇒-2b +3c ≡1 mod7 ⇒-2b +3c ≡1 mod7 ...(7)

From equation (4a):6a +2b +3c ≡6 mod7.

Let me express this as:6a ≡6 -2b -3c mod7 ...(8)

Now, from equation (7):-2b +3c ≡1 mod7 ⇒3c ≡2b +1 mod7.

Substitute into equation (8):

6a ≡6 -2b -(2b +1) mod7 ⇒6a ≡6 -4b -1 mod7 ⇒6a ≡5 -4b mod7.

But 6a ≡5 -4b mod7.

Let me write this as:6a +4b ≡5 mod7 ⇒6a +4b ≡5 mod7 ...(9)

Now, from equation (5):6a -2b ≡4 mod7.

Let me write this as:6a ≡4 +2b mod7 ...(10)

Substitute (10) into (9):

(4 +2b) +4b ≡5 mod7 ⇒4 +6b ≡5 ⇒6b ≡1 mod7.

Since 6 and7 are coprime, multiply both sides by6^{-1} mod7. 6*6=36≡1 mod7 ⇒6^{-1}=6.

So, b ≡6*1=6 mod7.

So, b≡6 mod7. So, possible b=6 or13, but since b is a digit, b=6.

Now, from equation (10):6a ≡4 +2*6=4+12=16≡2 mod7 ⇒6a≡2 mod7.

Multiply both sides by6^{-1}=6:

a≡2*6=12≡5 mod7.

So, a≡5 mod7. So, a=5 or12. But a is a digit, so a=5.

Now, from equation (6):6a -3c ≡3 mod7.

Substitute a=5:

6*5=30≡2 mod7 ⇒2 -3c ≡3 ⇒-3c ≡1 ⇒3c≡-1≡6 mod7 ⇒c≡6*5=30≡2 mod7.

So, c=2 or9.

To maximize N, choose c=9.

Now, from equation (1b):d ≡1 -2b -3c mod7.

Substitute b=6, c=9:

d≡1 -12 -27 mod7.

Compute each term mod7:

1 mod7=1,

-12 mod7= -12 +14=2,

-27 mod7= -27 +28=1.

So, d≡1 +2 +1=4 mod7.

So, d=4 or11. 11 invalid, so d=4.

So, N= a b c d =5 6 9 4 →5694.

Now, let's check if this satisfies all conditions.

First, check each modified number:

N1: change a to1:1694.

1694 ÷7: 7*242=1694 ⇒divisible.

N2: change b to1:5194.

5194 ÷7: 7*742=5194 ⇒divisible.

N3: change c to1:5614.

5614 ÷7: 7*802=5614 ⇒divisible.

N4: change d to1:5691.

5691 ÷7: 7*813=5691 ⇒divisible.

So, all four modified numbers are divisible by7.

Now, check if N=5694 is the greatest possible.

But wait, earlier we tried a=8 and a=7, but they didn't work. Now, with a=5, we found a valid N=5694.

But is there a larger N with a>5 that satisfies the conditions?

Let me check a=6.

From earlier steps, a must be≡5 mod7, so a=5 or12. 12 invalid, so a=5 is the only possibility. So, a=5.

Thus, the greatest N is5694.

Wait, but let me confirm.

From a=5, b=6, c=9, d=4.

Is there a way to have a=5, b=6, c=9, d=8 (since d≡4 mod7, but d=8≡4 mod7).

Wait, d≡4 mod7, so d=4 or11. 11 invalid, so d=4.

So, N=5694.

Is there a higher N?

If we can find a=5, b=6, c=9, d=4, which is 5694.

If we try a=5, b=6, c=9, d=4, which is the highest possible with a=5.

Alternatively, perhaps a=5, b=6, c=9, d=4 is the highest possible.

Wait, but perhaps I can adjust d to be8, which is≡4 mod7, so d=8.

So, N=5698.

Check the conditions:

N1: change a to1:1698.

1698 ÷7: 7*242=1694, 1698-1694=4 ⇒1698≡4 mod7. Not divisible.

So, invalid.

Thus, d=4 is the only option.

Therefore, N=5694 is the greatest four-digit number satisfying the conditions.

Now, compute Q and R when N is divided by1000.

N=5694.

Divide by1000: Q=5, R=694.

So, Q + R=5 +694=699.

Wait, but let me confirm.

Wait, 5694 ÷1000=5 with remainder 694.

So, Q=5, R=694.

Thus, Q + R=5+694=699.

Therefore, the answer is699.


The greatest four-digit number \( N \) satisfying the given conditions is 5694. When divided by 1000, the quotient \( Q \) is 5 and the remainder \( R \) is 694. Thus, \( Q + R = 5 + 694 = 699 \).

\boxed{699}
