Okay, so I have this geometry problem here. Let me try to figure it out step by step. The problem is about triangle ABC with circumcenter O and incenter I. It says that IA is perpendicular to OI, the circumradius is 13, and the inradius is 6. I need to find the product AB multiplied by AC, which is AB·AC.

First, let's recall some concepts. The circumradius R is the radius of the circumscribed circle around the triangle, and the inradius r is the radius of the inscribed circle. Here, R is 13, and r is 6.

The triangle has a circumcenter O, which is the intersection point of the perpendicular bisectors of the sides, and the incenter I, which is the intersection of the angle bisectors.

The problem states that IA is perpendicular to OI. That's an interesting condition. So, the line from the incenter I to vertex A is perpendicular to the line from the incenter I to the circumcenter O.

I think I should draw a diagram to visualize this. Let me imagine triangle ABC with O and I somewhere inside it. IA is perpendicular to OI. Hmm. Maybe I can place the triangle in a coordinate system to make it easier?

Alternatively, perhaps there are some known formulas or theorems that relate the inradius, circumradius, and other elements when IA is perpendicular to OI.

Wait, I remember that in a triangle, the distance between the incenter and circumcenter is given by the formula:

OI² = R(R - 2r)

Where R is the circumradius and r is the inradius. Let me check if I remember that correctly. Oh, yes, that's a standard formula. So, plugging in the given values:

OI² = 13(13 - 2*6) = 13(13 - 12) = 13*1 =13. So, OI = sqrt(13).

Wait, but the problem says IA is perpendicular to OI. So, in triangle IOA, we have a right angle at I. So, triangle IOA is a right-angled triangle with legs IO and IA, and hypotenuse OA.

In triangle IOA, OA is the circumradius, which is 13. IO is sqrt(13), as we found. IA is
