Okay, so I've got this tetrahedron problem here, and I need to find the distance from the incenter to each face. The tetrahedron is labeled ABCD, and the edges have specific lengths: AB and CD are both √41, AC and BD are √80, and BC and AD are √89. The point I is inside the tetrahedron, and its distances to each face are all equal. I need to find this distance in the form m√n/p, where m, n, p are positive integers, m and p are coprime, and n is square-free. Then, sum m + n + p for the answer.

Alright, so first, let me recall what an incenter is in a tetrahedron. In a tetrahedron, the incenter is the point equidistant from all four faces. This distance is called the inradius. In a way, it's analogous to the inradius of a triangle, which is the radius of the inscribed circle. So, similar to how in a triangle the inradius can be found using the formula r = A/s, where A is the area and s is the semi-perimeter, I think for a tetrahedron, the inradius can be found using the formula r = 3V / S, where V is the volume and S is the total surface area.

But wait, let me make sure. In a tetrahedron, each face is a triangle, and the inradius is the radius of the sphere tangent to all four faces. The formula for the inradius r is indeed r = 3V / S, where V is the volume of the tetrahedron and S is the total surface area (sum of the areas of all four faces). So, first, I need to find the volume of the tetrahedron and the total surface area.

But to do that, I need to know the areas of each of the four triangular faces. Since all edges are given, maybe I can compute the areas using Heron's formula for each face. But let's see.

Wait, but before that, perhaps I can notice some symmetry in the tetrahedron. The edge lengths are given such that opposite edges are equal: AB=CD, AC=BD, BC=AD. So this is a special kind of tetrahedron called an isosceles tetrahedron, or sometimes a disphenoid. In such tetrahedrons, all four faces are congruent triangles, but wait, is that the case here?

Wait, no. Because the opposite edges are equal, but the triangles might not necessarily be congruent. Let me check. For example, triangle ABC: edges AB = √41, BC = √89, AC = √80. Triangle ADC: edges AD = √89, DC = √41, AC = √80. So actually, triangles ABC and ADC are congruent because all corresponding sides are equal. Similarly, triangles ABD and CBD: AB=√41, BD=√80, AD=√89 versus CB=√89, BD=√80, CD=√41. So those are also congruent. So the tetrahedron has two pairs of congruent triangular faces, meaning that all four faces have the same area. Wait, is that true?

Wait, no, because if you look at one face, say ABC: sides √41, √80, √89. Another face, say ABD: sides √41, √80, √89. So all four faces are congruent triangles. So each face has the same area. That's a big help because it means the total surface area S is 4 times the area of one face.

So, if I can compute the area of one face, then multiply by four to get S. Then, if I can compute the volume V, I can plug into r = 3V/S.

So, let's compute the area of one face. Let's take triangle ABC with sides a = √41, b = √80, c = √89.

First, compute the semi-perimeter, s:
s = (a + b + c) / 2
= (√41 + √80 + √89) / 2.

Hmm, that looks messy. Maybe instead, I can compute the area using Heron's formula, but Heron's formula might be complicated with square roots. Alternatively, perhaps I can check if the triangle is right-angled? If so, the area would be straightforward.

Let me check: Is (√41)^2 + (√80)^2 = (√89)^2?

Compute:
41 + 80 = 121
(√89)^2 = 89
121 ≠ 89, so it's not a right-angled triangle. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps use vectors or coordinates to model the tetrahedron? Since all opposite edges are equal, maybe it's a symmetric tetrahedron, so I can assign coordinates to the vertices in such a way that calculations are easier.

Yes, that might be a good approach. Let me try that.

In a symmetric tetrahedron like this, we can place the vertices such that each pair of opposite edges are equal. So, let me assign coordinates to the points in 3D space.

Let me denote the points as follows:

Let me consider point A at (x, y, z), B at (-x, -y, z), C at (-x, y, -z), D at (x, -y, -z). This is a common way to set up symmetric
