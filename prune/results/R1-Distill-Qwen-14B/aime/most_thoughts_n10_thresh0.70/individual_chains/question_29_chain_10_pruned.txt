Okay, so I'm trying to solve this geometry problem, and I need to find the length of CE. Let me read the problem again and break it down.

We have two rectangles, ABCD and EFGH. The points D, E, C, F are collinear. Also, points A, D, H, G all lie on a circle. The given lengths are BC = 16, AB = 107, FG = 17, and EF = 184. I need to find CE.

Hmm, rectangles have opposite sides equal and all angles are right angles. So, in rectangle ABCD, AB = CD = 107 and BC = AD =16. Similarly, in rectangle EFGH, EF = GH = 184 and FG = EH =17.

Since D, E, C, F are collinear, that means they lie on a straight line. So, points D and C are from rectangle ABCD, while E and F are from rectangle EFGH. The line passes through D, E, C, F in that order? Or maybe another order? Hmm, not sure yet.

Also, points A, D, H, G lie on a circle. So, these four points are concyclic or lie on the same circumference. That must mean that A, D, H, G form a cyclic quadrilateral. That gives us some properties to use, like the fact that the product of the diagonals can be related or perhaps the power of a point.

Let me try to visualize or maybe even sketch a rough drawing.

First, rectangle ABCD: Let's say A is at the bottom left, B at the bottom right, C at the top right, D at the top left. So, AB is the base, BC is the side, etc.

Rectangle EFGH: Since E and F are points on the line that also includes D and C, let me think about where E and F could be. Maybe E is to the left of D and F is to the right of C? Or maybe E is between D and C, and F is further out? Hmm, not sure yet. But since EF is 184, which is much longer than BC which is 16, perhaps E and F are on the same line but extended beyond D and C.

Wait, but E and F are from rectangle EFGH. So, EF is a side of the rectangle, and FG is another side. So, EF is 184, FG is 17, so the sides are 184 and 17.

Now, since E, D, C, F are collinear, and looking at the rectangles, perhaps E is aligned such that when you go from E to F, you pass through D and C.

So, maybe the line EF passes through D and C, making E and F points on this line such that E is connected to F, forming the rectangle EFGH.

Hmm, perhaps I should assign coordinates to the points to make this easier. Let's place point D at the origin (0,0), just to simplify calculations. Then, since ABCD is a rectangle, we can assign coordinates accordingly.

Wait, if D is at (0,0), then since ABCD is a rectangle with BC = 16 and AB = 107, let me think. Wait, in a rectangle, AB is adjacent to BC. So, if D is at (0,0), then A would be at (0, BC) which is (0,16), but wait, wait, no. Wait, in rectangle ABCD, the points are A, B, C, D connected in order. So, if D is at (0,0), C would be at (x,0), B at (x, y), and A at (0, y). Wait, perhaps that's more complicated. Maybe it's better to set D at (0,0), so since ABCD is a rectangle, we can assign coordinates as follows:

Let me define the coordinates more carefully.

Let me place point D at (0,0). Then, since ABC
