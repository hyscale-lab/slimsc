Okay, so I have this problem about residents in Aimeville and the things they own. Let me try to break it down step by step. 

First, the problem says there are 900 residents. Each of them owns a bag of candy hearts. So, that's a given for everyone. Then, some own a diamond ring, some a set of golf clubs, some a garden spade, and all have candy hearts. 

The numbers are: 195 own a diamond ring, 367 own golf clubs, 562 own a garden spade, and everyone owns candy hearts. So, the total number of items owned is a combination of these four. 

It also mentions that 437 residents own exactly two of these things, and 234 own exactly three. We need to find how many own all four. 

Hmm, okay. I remember something about the principle of inclusion-exclusion from set theory. Maybe that's the way to go here. Let me recall how that works. 

Inclusion-exclusion principle is used to calculate the size of the union of multiple sets by adding the sizes of the individual sets, subtracting the sizes of all possible two-set intersections, adding back the sizes of all possible three-set intersections, and so on. 

But wait, in this problem, we aren't directly given the number of people owning all four. Instead, we have information about those who own exactly two and exactly three. 

Let me denote the sets:

- Let A be the set of people who own a diamond ring.
- B be those who own a set of golf clubs.
- C be those who own a garden spade.
- D be those who own a bag of candy hearts. 

But wait, the problem says every resident owns a bag of candy hearts, so D is the entire population. So, D has 900 people. 

We need to find the number of people who own all four, so that's the intersection of A, B, C, and D. But since D is everyone, that's the same as A ∩ B ∩ C. 

So, the problem simplifies to finding |A ∩ B ∩ C|. 

Now, the problem gives us the number of people who own exactly two of the things and exactly three. Let me note that:

- Exactly two: 437 people.
- Exactly three: 234 people.

We also know the total number of people is 900.

I think the key here is to use the inclusion-exclusion principle for four sets, but considering the given counts. Wait, but since D is the universal set, maybe it's easier to think in terms of three sets. Because everyone is in D, so D doesn't affect the intersections beyond including everyone. 

Wait, but the problem includes D in the counts, but since D is everyone, the counts for exactly two and exactly three are considering D as one of the possibilities. Hmm, that might complicate things. Let me think again.

Alternatively, perhaps I can model the problem with four sets, but since D is universal, any intersection involving D is the same as the other sets. So, for example, A ∩ D is just A, since everyone owns D. So, maybe the problem is effectively about three sets,
