Alright, so I've got this problem with logarithms and three variables, x, y, and z. It's a system of equations, and I need to find the absolute value of log base 2 of x^4 y^3 z^2. Then, express that as a fraction m/n where m and n are coprime, and find m + n. Hmm, okay, let's break this down.

The equations given are:

1. log₂(x / (y z)) = 1/2
2. log₂(y / (x z)) = 1/3
3. log₂(z / (x y)) = 1/4

So, all of these are logarithms base 2. Since logarithms can be tricky, maybe I can rewrite each equation in exponential form to make it simpler. Remember, log_b(a) = c is equivalent to b^c = a.

Let's rewrite each equation:

1. 2^(1/2) = x / (y z)
2. 2^(1/3) = y / (x z)
3. 2^(1/4) = z / (x y)

Simplify the exponents:

1. sqrt(2) = x / (y z) → equation (1)
2. 2^(1/3) = y / (x z) → equation (2)
3. 2^(1/4) = z / (x y) → equation (3)

Hmm, now I have three equations with variables in the numerator and denominator. Maybe I can express x, y, z in terms of each other. Let me see.

From equation (1): x = sqrt(2) * y z.

From equation (2): y = 2^(1/3) * x z.

From equation (3): z = 2^(1/4) * x y.

Hmm, substituting might get messy, but let's try to express everything in terms of one variable. Let's see if I can substitute x from equation (1) into equation (2), then into equation (3).

From equation (1), x = sqrt(2) y z. Let's plug this into equation (2):

y = 2^(1/3) * (sqrt(2) y z) * z = 2^(1/3) * sqrt(2) * y z^2.

Wait, so y = [2^(1/3) * 2^(1/2)] y z^2.

Simplify the exponents: 2^(1/3 + 1/2) = 2^(5/6). So,

y = 2^(5/6) y z^2.

Hmm, I can divide both sides by y (since y is positive, so it's not zero):

1 = 2^(5/6) z^2.

So, z^2 = 1 / 2^(5/6) = 2^(-5/6).

Taking square roots:

z = 2^(-5/12). Because sqrt(2^(-5/6)) = 2^(-5/12). Since z is positive, we take the positive root.

Okay, so z is 2^(-5/12). Let me note that down.

Now, let's go back to equation (1): x = sqrt(2) * y z.

We have z = 2^(-5/12), so let's plug that in:

x = 2^(1/2) * y * 2^(-5/12) = y * 2^(1/2 - 5/12).

Compute the exponent: 1/2 is 6/12, so 6/12 -5/12 = 1/12.

So, x = y * 2^(1/12). So, x = y * 2^(1/12). Let's keep that in mind.

Now, let's go to equation (2): y = 2^(1/3) * x z.

We already have x in terms of y, so substitute x:

y = 2^(1/3) * (y * 2^(1/12)) * z.

We also know z is 2^(-5/12), so plug that in:

y = 2^(1/3) * y * 2^(1/12) * 2^(-5/12).

Combine the exponents:

2^(1/3) * 2^(1/12 -5/12) = 2^(1/3) * 2^(-4/12) = 2^(1/3) * 2^(-1/3) = 2^(0) = 1.

So, y = 1 * y → y = y.

Wait, that just gives an identity. Hmm, that doesn't help me find y. Maybe I need to try a different approach.

Alternatively, maybe I can express all variables in terms of each other and then set up a system.

We have:

From equation (1): x = 2^(1/2) y z → equation (1a)

From equation (2): y = 2^(1/3) x z → equation (2a)

From equation (3): z = 2^(1/4) x y → equation (3a)

Let me substitute equation (1a) into equation (2a):

y = 2^(1/3) * (2^(1/2) y z) * z = 2^(1/3 + 1/2) y z^2.

Which is similar to what I did earlier, leading to z^2 = 2^(-5/6), so z=2^(-5/12). So, that gives us z.

Now, knowing z, let's plug back into equation (1a) to find x in terms of y.

x = 2^(1/2) y z = 2^(1/2) * y * 2^(-5/12) = y * 2^(1/2 - 5/12).

Compute 1/2 -5/12: 6/12 -5/12 =1/12. So, x = y * 2^(1/12).

Now, let's find y. Let's use equation (3a): z = 2^(1/4) x y.

We know z=2^(-5/12), x = y * 2^(1/12), so plug into equation (3a):

2^(-5/12) = 2^(1/4) * (y * 2^(1/12)) * y.

Simplify the RHS:

2^(1/4) * y * 2^(1/12) * y = 2^(1/4 +1/12) * y^2.

Compute the exponent: 1/4 is 3/12, so 3/12 +1/12=4/12=1/3.

So, RHS is 2^(1/3) y^2.

Set equal to LHS:

2^(-5/12) = 2^(1/3) y^2.

Divide both sides by 2^(1/3):

y^2 = 2^(-5/12 -1/3) = 2^(-5/12 -4/12) = 2^(-9/12) = 2^(-3/4).

Thus, y = 2^(-3/8). Since y is positive.

Now, since x = y * 2^(1/12), plug in y:

x = 2^(-3/8) * 2^(1/12) = 2^(-3/8 +1/12).

Find common denominator for exponents: 24.

-3/8 = -9/24, 1/12=2/24, so total exponent is (-9 +2)/24 = -7/24.

So, x = 2^(-7/24).

And z is already known as 2^(-5/12) which is 2^(-10/24).

So, now we have x, y, z in terms of exponents of 2:

x = 2^(-7/24)

y = 2^(-3/8) = 2^(-9/24)

z = 2^(-10/24)

Wait, perhaps I should express all exponents with denominator 24 to make it easier.

So,

x = 2^(-7/24)

y = 2
