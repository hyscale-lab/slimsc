Okay, let's try to solve this geometry problem. Hmm, we have triangle ABC inscribed in a circle ω. The tangents at B and C meet at point D, and line AD intersects ω again at point P. We're given the lengths AB = 5, BC = 9, and AC = 10. We need to find AP, which is a fraction m/n where m and n are coprime, and then compute m + n.

First, I should probably draw a diagram to visualize everything. Oh wait, the Asymptote code is provided, but I can't see the image. So I have to imagine it based on the description. Triangle ABC with AB=5, BC=9, AC=10. The circle ω is the circumcircle of ABC. The tangents at B and C meet at D, which is the ex-pole of BC, I think. Then AD meets ω again at P.

I remember that when two tangents are drawn from a point to a circle, the lengths from that point to the points of tangency are equal. So, DB = DC because both are tangents from D to ω at points B and C respectively.

Next, perhaps I can use power of a point. The power of point D with respect to ω is DB² = DC² = DA * DP, since AD is a secant line intersecting ω at A and P. So, if I can find DB, I can express DP in terms of DA and then find AP.

Wait, but how do I find DB? Maybe I can find the length of DB by using triangle ABC's properties. Alternatively, perhaps using coordinate geometry or trigonometry.

Alternatively, maybe using triangle similarity or harmonic division properties. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe using inversion. But that might be complicated. Let's think step by step.

First, let's find the circumradius of triangle ABC. Since we have all three sides, we can compute the circumradius R using the formula:

R = (a*b*c)/(4*Δ)

where a, b, c are the sides, and Δ is the area of the triangle.

So, let's compute the area Δ using Heron's formula.

The sides are AB=5, BC=9, AC=10. Let me label them as a=9, b=10, c=5? Wait, wait, actually, in standard notation, a is BC, b is AC, c is AB. So a=9, b=10, c=5.

Wait, wait, actually, let me be precise. In triangle ABC, side opposite vertex A is BC = a = 9, side opposite B is AC = b = 10, and side opposite C is AB = c =5.

So, semi-perimeter s = (a + b + c)/2 = (9 + 10 +5)/2 = (24)/2 =12.

Then, area Δ = sqrt[s(s-a)(s-b)(s-c)] = sqrt[12*(12-9)*(12-10)*(12-5)] = sqrt[12*3*2*7] = sqrt[504] = sqrt[16*31.5] Wait, 504 = 16*31.5? Wait, 16*31.5 is 504, yes. So sqrt(504) = sqrt(16*31.5) = 4*sqrt(31.5). Wait, 31.5 is 63/2, so sqrt(63/2) = (3*sqrt(14))/sqrt(2) = (3*sqrt(28))/2. Wait, maybe I should compute it differently.

Wait, 504 factors into 16 * 31.5, but perhaps better to factor into primes: 504 = 8 * 63 = 8 * 9 *7 = 2^3 * 3^2 *7. So sqrt(504) = 2^(3/2) *3 * sqrt(7) = 2*sqrt(2)*3*sqrt(7) = 6*sqrt(14). So Δ=6√14.

So, the area is 6√14.

Therefore, the circumradius R = (a*b*c)/(4Δ) = (9*10*5)/(4*6√14) = (450)/(24√14) = (75)/(4√14). Maybe rationalize the denominator: (75√14)/(4*14) = (75√14)/56.

Wait, 75 and 56 are coprime? 75 factors into 3*5^2, 56 is 7*8, so yes, coprime. So R = (75√14)/56.

Now, the tangents from D to ω are DB and DC. The length of the tangent from D to ω is equal to sqrt(OD^2 - R^2), but that might not help directly since we don't know OD.

Alternatively, perhaps use power of point D. The power of D with respect to ω is DB² = DC² = DA * DP.

So, if I can find DB, then I can write DB² = DA * DP, which would be useful. But how to find DB?

Alternatively, perhaps use coordinates. Let me try coordinate geometry.

Let me place point C at the origin (0,0), point A at (10,0), since AC=10. Then point B is somewhere in the plane. Let me find
