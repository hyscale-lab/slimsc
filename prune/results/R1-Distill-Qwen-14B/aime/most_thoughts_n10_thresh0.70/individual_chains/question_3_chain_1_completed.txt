Okay, so I need to solve this probability problem. Let me read it again.

Jen picks 4 distinct numbers from the set S = {1,2,3,...,10}. Then, 4 numbers are randomly chosen from S. She wins a prize if at least two of her numbers match two of the randomly chosen numbers. She wins the grand prize if all four of her numbers match the four chosen. The question is about the probability that she wins the grand prize given that she won a prize. They express this probability as m/n where m and n are coprime, and we need to find m + n.

Hmm, okay. So this is a conditional probability problem. The probability we’re looking for is P(grand prize | she won a prize). 

In probability terms, conditional probability is defined as P(A|B) = P(A ∩ B) / P(B). But in this case, if she wins the grand prize, she must have won a prize, right? Because the grand prize is a subset of winning a prize. So, P(A ∩ B) is just P(A), since A (winning the grand prize) is a subset of B (winning a prize). Therefore, P(grand prize | prize) = P(grand prize) / P(prize).

So, I need to find two probabilities: the probability that she wins the grand prize and the probability that she wins any prize. Then, divide the first by the second.

Let me define the terms:

- Let’s denote the event G as "she wins the grand prize," which means all four of her numbers are chosen.
- Let’s denote the event P as "she wins a prize," which means at least two of her numbers are chosen.

So, P(G | P) = P(G) / P(P)

First, let's compute P(G). The probability that all four of her numbers are chosen. Since the lottery is choosing 4 numbers from 10, and she has exactly 4 numbers, the number of possible winning combinations for the grand prize is 1 (only her set). The total number of possible combinations is C(10,4). So, P(G) = 1 / C(10,4).

Calculating C(10,4): 10! / (4! * (10-4)!) = (10*9*8*7)/(4*3*2*1) = 210. So, P(G) = 1/210.

Next, compute P(P), the probability that she wins at least two matches. Winning a prize means she has at least two numbers among the four chosen. So, she could have exactly two, exactly three, or exactly four numbers matching.

Therefore, P(P) = P(exactly 2) + P(exactly 3) + P(exactly 4).

We can compute each of these probabilities and sum them.

Alternatively, it's sometimes easier to compute the complement: 1 - P(no prize). P(no prize) is the probability that she has fewer than two matches, which is either zero or one. So, P(prize) = 1 - [P(0) + P(1)]

Maybe that's easier since calculating P(0) and P(1) might involve fewer terms.

Wait, actually, let's check which is easier. Let's see: to compute P(exactly k matches), we can use the hypergeometric distribution.

The hypergeometric probability is given by:

P(k) = [C(4, k) * C(6, 4 - k)] / C(10,4)

Wait, is that correct? Let me think.

Wait, no. The hypergeometric distribution is used when we have a population of size N, with K successes, and we sample n, so the probability of exactly k successes is [C(K, k) * C(N - K, n - k)] / C(N, n).

In this case, N = 10, K = 4 (Jen's numbers), n = 4 (lottery numbers). So, the probability of exactly k matches is [C(4, k) * C(10 - 4, 4 - k)] / C(10,4) = [C(4,k) * C(6,4 -k)] / 210.

So, P(k) = [C(4,k)*C(6,4 -k)] / 210 for k = 0,1,2,3,4.

So, let's compute P(0), P(1), P(2), P(3), P(4).

But since we need P(P) = P(2) + P(3) + P(4), let's compute each term.

Compute P(2):

C(4,2) * C(6, 2) = (6) * (15) = 90

So, P(2) = 90 / 210 = 3/7.

Compute P(3):

C(4,3) * C(6,1) = 4 * 6 = 24

P(3) = 24 / 210 = 4/35.

Compute P(4):

C(4,4)*C(6,0) = 1 * 1 =1

P(4) = 1 / 210.

So, P(P) = 90/210 + 24/210 + 1/210 = (90 +24 +1)/210 = 115 / 210.

Simplify 115/210: both divisible by 5. 115 ÷5=23, 210 ÷5=42. So, 23/42.

Alternatively, maybe I made a miscalculation. Let me check.

Wait, 90 +24 is 114, plus 1 is 115. So yes, 115/210. Simplify: divide numerator and denominator by 5: 23/42.

So, P(P) = 23/42.

But wait, another way to compute P(P) is 1 - [P(0) + P(1)].

Let me compute P(0) and P(1) to verify.

P(0) = [C(4,0)*C(6,4)] / 210 = 1 * 15 = 15. So, 15/210 = 1/14.

P(1) = [C(4,1)*C(6,3)] /210 = 4 * 20 =80. So, 80/210 = 8/21.

So, P(0) + P(1) = 15/210 +80/210 = 95/210. Simplify: 19/42.

Therefore, P(P) = 1 - 19/42 = 23/42. Which matches my earlier result. So, that's correct.

So, P(G) = 1/210, P(P) =23/42.

So, the conditional probability P(G | P) = (1/210) / (23/42) = (1/210) * (42/23) = (42)/(210*23) = (1)/(5 *23) = 1/115.

Wait, let me compute that again.

Wait, (1/210) divided by (23/42) is equal to (1/210) * (42/23). Let me compute this.

42/210 is 1/5, so (1/5) * (1/23) = 1/(5*23) = 1/115.

So, m =1, n=115. Are they coprime? Yes, since 115 is 5*23, and 1 shares no common factors. So m +n=1+115=116.

Wait, but wait, let me double-check. Because sometimes it's easy to make a mistake in counting.

Wait, another way to compute the conditional probability is to count the number of favorable outcomes over the number of possible prize outcomes.

In other words, the number of ways she could have all four numbers is 1, and the number of ways she could have at least two numbers is the total number of 4-number combinations that share at least two numbers with her four.

So, perhaps another way to compute the probability is to think combinatorially.

Number of ways to choose 4 numbers from 10: C(10,4)=210.

Number of ways she can have at least two matches: C(4,2)*C(6,2) + C(4,3)*C(6,1) + C(4,4)*C(6,0) = [6*15] + [4*6] + [1*1] = 90 +24 +1=115. So, 115 ways.

Number of ways she can have all four matches:1.

So, conditional probability is 1/115.

Yes, same result.

So, the probability is 1/115, so m +n=1+115=116.

Hmm, seems correct.

Wait, but wait, another way: the conditional probability is the probability that, given she has at least two matches, she actually has all four.

So, it's like the probability that all four are chosen given that at least two are chosen.

Alternatively, it's like the probability that, in a hypergeometric distribution, given that the number of successes is at least 2, what is the probability that it's exactly 4.

So, yeah, same as (number of ways to have exactly 4 successes) divided by (number of ways to have at least 2 successes).

Which is 1 / 115, as above.

So, yeah, I think that's correct.

So, the answer is 116.

**Final Answer**
\boxed{116}


Jen picks 4 distinct numbers from the set \( S = \{1, 2, 3, \ldots, 10\} \). Four numbers are randomly chosen from \( S \). She wins a prize if at least two of her numbers match two of the randomly chosen numbers, and wins the grand prize if all four of her numbers match the four chosen. We need to find the probability of winning the grand prize given that she won a prize.

First, we compute the probability of winning the grand prize, \( P(G) \). The number of ways to choose 4 numbers from 10 is \( \binom{10}{4} = 210 \). The probability of winning the grand prize is:
\[ P(G) = \frac{1}{210} \]

Next, we compute the probability of winning a prize, \( P(P) \). This is the probability of having at least two matches. We use the hypergeometric distribution to compute the probabilities of having exactly 2, 3, or 4 matches.

- Probability of exactly 2 matches:
  \[ P(2) = \frac{\binom{4}{2} \binom{6}{2}}{\binom{10}{4}} = \frac{6 \times 15}{210} = \frac{90}{210} = \frac{3}{7} \]

- Probability of exactly 3 matches:
  \[ P(3) = \frac{\binom{4}{3} \binom{6}{1}}{\binom{10}{4}} = \frac{4 \times 6}{210} = \frac{24}{210} = \frac{4}{35} \]

- Probability of exactly 4 matches:
  \[ P(4) = \frac{\binom{4}{4} \binom{6}{0}}{\binom{10}{4}} = \frac{1 \times 1}{210} = \frac{1}{210} \]

Summing these probabilities gives:
\[ P(P) = P(2) + P(3) + P(4) = \frac{90}{210} + \frac{24}{210} + \frac{1}{210} = \frac{115}{210} = \frac{23}{42} \]

The conditional probability \( P(G | P) \) is:
\[ P(G | P) = \frac{P(G)}{P(P)} = \frac{\frac{1}{210}}{\frac{23}{42}} = \frac{1}{210} \times \frac{42}{23} = \frac{1}{115} \]

Thus, the probability is \( \frac{1}{115} \), where \( m = 1 \) and \( n = 115 \). Therefore, \( m + n = 1 + 115 = 116 \).

\[
\boxed{116}
\]
