Okay, so I need to solve this geometry problem. Let me read through it again to make sure I understand all the parts.

We have points O at (0,0), A at (1/2, 0), and B at (0, sqrt(3)/2). So, O is the origin, A is on the x-axis halfway between O and (1,0), and B is on the y-axis at a point that's sqrt(3)/2 units up, which is approximately 0.866.

Then there's a family of segments F, which are all segments PQ of unit length lying in the first quadrant. Each segment has P on the x-axis and Q on the y-axis. So these are like little line segments starting on the x-axis, ending on the y-axis, each exactly 1 unit long.

The problem says there's a unique point C on AB, which is different from A and B, that doesn't lie on any segment from F except for AB itself. Then we need to find OC squared, which is the square of the distance from the origin to point C. The answer should be a fraction p/q where p and q are coprime, and then find p + q.

Alright, so first, let me visualize this. The points O, A, B form a triangle. OA is 1/2, OB is sqrt(3)/2. The line AB connects A and B. So AB is a line segment from (1/2,0) to (0, sqrt(3)/2). That should form a triangle with O, and I think it's a 30-60-90 triangle because the lengths are 1/2, sqrt(3)/2, and the hypotenuse would be 1, but wait that's not the case here. Wait, OA is 1/2, OB is sqrt(3)/2, so the distance AB would be sqrt( (1/2)^2 + (sqrt(3)/2)^2 ) = sqrt(1/4 + 3/4) = sqrt(1) = 1. Oh, so triangle OAB is equilateral? Because all sides are 1.

Wait, OA is 1/2? Wait, O is (0,0), A is (1/2, 0). So OA is 1/2 units, not 1. So OB is sqrt(3)/2, which is approximately 0.866. Then AB is 1, as we calculated. So the triangle OAB has sides 1/2, sqrt(3)/2, and 1. That would make it a right triangle, because (1/2)^2 + (sqrt(3)/2)^2 = 1/4 + 3/4 = 1, which is equal to 1^2. So it's a right triangle with right angle at O.

Wait, but in that case, points O, A, B would form a right-angled triangle at O. But the problem says O, A, B are points in the plane, and we're looking at segment AB, which is of length 1.

Now, the family F consists of all segments PQ of unit length in the first quadrant with P on the x-axis and Q on the y-axis. So each segment PQ has P at (p, 0) and Q at (0, q), with the distance between P and Q being 1. So the distance formula gives sqrt(p^2 + q^2) = 1, so p^2 + q^2 = 1. So each PQ segment lies on the line x/p + y/q = 1, but since PQ is a unit length, p and q satisfy p^2 + q^2 =1.

So the family F is all such segments PQ where P is (p,0), Q is (0,q), and p^2 + q^2 =1. These are like all the possible unit-length segments from the x-axis to the y-axis in the first quadrant.

Now, we need to find a point C on AB (other than A and B) that doesn't lie on any of these PQ segments except AB itself. So C is a point on AB such that for any other segment PQ in F, C is not on PQ.

The problem says this point C is unique, so there's only one such point. Then, we need to find OC^2, which is the square of the distance from the origin to C.

So, how do I approach this? I think we can parametrize point C on AB, then find conditions under which C doesn't lie on any other PQ segments in F except AB itself.

First, let me find the equation of line AB. Since A is (1/2, 0) and B is (0, sqrt(3)/2), the slope of AB is (sqrt(3)/2 - 0)/(0 - 1/2) = (sqrt(3)/2) / (-1/2) = -sqrt(3). So the equation of AB is y = -sqrt(3)x + sqrt(3)*(0) + c. Wait, plugging in point A: (1/2, 0). So 0 = -sqrt(3)*(1/2) + c, so c = sqrt(3)/2. So equation is y = -sqrt(3)x + sqrt(3)/2.

Wait, that can't be right because when x=0, y should be sqrt(3)/2, which it is. And when y=0, x= (sqrt(3)/2) / sqrt(3) )= 1/2. Correct. So equation of AB is y = -sqrt(3)x + sqrt(3)/2.

So any point C on AB can be written as (t, -sqrt(3)t + sqrt(3)/2), where t ranges from 0 to 1/2. Because when t=0, it's point B, and when t=1/2, it's point A.

Wait, no. Wait, when t is 0, x=0, y=sqrt(3)/2, which is B. When t=1/2, x=1/2, y= -sqrt(3)*(1/2) + sqrt(3)/2 = 0, which is
