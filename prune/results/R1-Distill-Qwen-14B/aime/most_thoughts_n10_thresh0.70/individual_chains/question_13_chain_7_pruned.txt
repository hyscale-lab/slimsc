Okay, so I've got this math problem to solve, and I'm a bit nervous because word problems can sometimes trip me up. But I'll take it step by step.

Alright, let's read the problem again and try to understand what's being asked.

Every morning, Aya goes for a 9-kilometer-long walk and stops at a coffee shop afterwards. When she walks at a constant speed of s kilometers per hour, the walk takes her 4 hours, including t minutes spent in the coffee shop. When she walks at s+2 kilometers per hour, the walk takes her 2 hours and 24 minutes, including t minutes spent in the coffee shop. Now, suppose Aya walks at s + 1/2 kilometers per hour. We need to find the number of minutes the walk takes her, including the t minutes spent in the coffee shop.

Hmm, so the key here is that the total time includes both the walking time and the coffee shop time. I need to find the total time when her speed is s + 1/2 km/h.

Let me break it down.

First, when she walks at speed s, the total time is 4 hours, which includes t minutes of coffee. So, the walking time alone is 4 hours minus t minutes. Similarly, when she walks faster, at s+2, the total time is 2 hours and 24 minutes, which again includes t minutes. So, the walking time alone here is 2h24m minus t minutes.

Wait, but time is in different units in the problem. The walking speed is in km/h, and the times are in hours and minutes. I should probably convert everything to the same unit to avoid confusion. Let's convert all time into minutes because the problem asks for the final answer in minutes.

So, 4 hours is 4*60 = 240 minutes. Similarly, 2 hours and 24 minutes is 2*60 +24 = 144 minutes.

So, when she walks at speed s km/h, the walking time (without coffee) is 240 - t minutes. But wait, wait. Because the total time includes t minutes, the walking time alone would be (total time) minus t. But wait, no, because the total time is the walking time plus the coffee time. So, if the total time is T, then walking time is T - t.

But in
