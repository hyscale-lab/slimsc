Okay, so I have this problem here: I need to find the least prime number p such that there's a positive integer n where n^4 + 1 is divisible by p squared, which is p². Then, I have to find the smallest positive integer m where m^4 +1 is divisible by p². Hmm, okay, that sounds a bit complex, but let me break it down.

First, I think I should recall some number theory concepts. I remember that when dealing with primes and divisibility, Fermat's Little Theorem often comes into play, but I'm not sure yet how it applies here. Also, since we're dealing with n^4 +1, maybe something about the multiplicative order of n modulo p is relevant.

Wait, so p is the smallest prime where p² divides n^4 +1 for some n. That means that n^4 ≡ -1 mod p². Hmm, but n^4 ≡ -1 mod p implies that the order of n modulo p divides 8, right? Because (n^4)^2 ≡ 1 mod p. So the multiplicative order of n modulo p divides 8. But since n^4 ≡ -1 mod p, the order can't be 4, because then n^4 ≡1 mod p, which would contradict n^4 ≡ -1. So the order must be 8. Therefore, 8 divides the order of the multiplicative group modulo p, which is p-1. So p ≡ 1 mod 8.

Wait, but wait a second. Let me make sure. If n^4 ≡ -1 mod p, then n^8 ≡ 1 mod p. So the multiplicative order of n modulo p is 8, which means 8 divides p-1, so p ≡1 mod 8. So p must be a prime that is 1 mod 8. The primes that are 1 mod 8 are 17, 97, etc., but wait, 17 is the first one after 2, but let me check smaller primes.

Wait, no, 2 is a prime. Let me think about p=2. Let me see if p=2 can satisfy the condition. For p=2, we're looking for n such that n^4 +1 is divisible by 4. Let's compute n^4 mod 4. If n is odd, n ≡1 mod 2, so n^4 ≡1 mod 4, then n^4 +1≡2 mod 4, which is not divisible by 4. If n is even, n ≡0 mod 2, so n^4 ≡0 mod 4, so n^4 +1≡1 mod 4, which isn't divisible by 4 either. So p=2 doesn't work.

How about p=5? Let's check if there's an n such that n^4 ≡ -1 mod 5. Let's compute n^4 mod 5. The possible residues mod 5 are 0,1,2,3,4.

Compute n^4 mod 5:

- 0^4=0
- 1^4=1
- 2^4=16≡1 mod5
- 3^4=81≡1 mod5
- 4^4=256≡1 mod5.

Wait, so n^4 mod5 is either 0 or 1. So n^4 ≡ -1 mod5 would imply n^4≡4 mod5, but we just saw it's either 0 or 1, so no solution. So p=5 can't be such a prime.

Next, p=13? Wait, why 13? Because p=17 is the next prime congruent to 1 mod8. Let me check p=17.

Wait, but perhaps I should check p=17 first. Let me see if n^4 ≡-1 mod17 is solvable. If it is, then maybe n^4 ≡-1 mod17² could have solutions.

Wait, but I'm getting ahead of myself. Let's not jump to p=17 yet. Let's check all primes less than 17 first. So the primes are 2,3,5,7,11,13,17.

We've already seen that 2,5 don't work. Let's check p=3.

For p=3: n^4 ≡-1 mod3. Let's compute n^4 mod3.

n can be 0,1,2 mod3.

0^4=0
1^4=1
2^4=16≡1 mod3.

So n^4 mod3 is either 0 or1. So n^4
