Okay, so I have this geometry problem here. Let me try to make sense of it step by step. The problem says:

Let $ABC$ be a triangle inscribed in circle $\omega$. The tangents to $\omega$ at $B$ and $C$ intersect at point $D$, and let $\overline{AD}$ intersect $\omega$ at $P$. Given that $AB=5$, $BC=9$, and $AC=10$, I need to find $AP$ and express it as $\frac{m}{n}$ where $m$ and $n$ are coprime, then find $m + n$.

Hmm, okay. So, let me write down what I know. We have triangle $ABC$ with sides $AB=5$, $BC=9$, and $AC=10$. It's inscribed in a circle $\omega$, so $\omega$ is the circumcircle of triangle $ABC$. Points $D$ is where the tangents at $B$ and $C$ intersect. Then, line $AD$ intersects the circle again at point $P$, and I need to find $AP$.

First, I remember that the point where two tangents intersect has some properties. Specifically, $D$ is the ex-pole of line $BC$ with respect to circle $\omega$? Or wait, no, more accurately, $D$ is the ex-pole of line $BC$, meaning that $D$ lies on the exterior of the circle, and the tangents from $D$ touch the circle at $B$ and $C$. So, $DB = DC$ because the lengths of tangents from a common external point to a circle are equal. That's a key property.

So, $DB = DC$, which might come in handy. Now, points $B$ and $C$ are on the circle, and $D$ is outside. The line $AD$ passes through $D$ and intersects the circle again at $P$. So, $AP$ is part of this line, from $A$ to $P$, which is on the circle.

I think I can use the power of a point here. The power of point $D$ with respect to $\omega$ should be equal to $DB^2 = DC^2$. Also, since $D$ lies on line $AD$, which intersects the circle at $A$ and $P$, the power of $D$ with respect to $\omega$ can also be expressed as $DA \cdot DP$.

So, putting that together: $DB^2 = DA \cdot DP$. That seems useful. If I can find $DA$, then I can find $DP$, and since $AP = AD - DP$, maybe I can find $AP$.

Wait, but I don't know $DA$ yet. Hmm. Let me see. Maybe I can find $DA$ using triangle $ABD$ or something else.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use Menelaus' theorem or Ceva's theorem, but I'm not sure yet. Another approach is to use coordinate geometry, maybe placing the triangle in coordinate system to compute coordinates of all points. But that might be complicated.

Wait, let me think about the power of point $D$. So, $DB^2 = DA \cdot DP$. That's one equation. If I can express $DA$ in terms of other known quantities, then maybe I can solve for $DP$ and hence find $AP$.

But to do that, I need to know $DB$, which is the length of the tangent from $D$ to $\omega$. Alternatively, I can express $DB$ in terms of the sides of the triangle. Let's see.

Wait, I also know that in triangle $ABC$, sides are given. So perhaps I can compute the circumradius of triangle $ABC$, which would be the radius of circle $\omega$. If I can find the circumradius, maybe I can find other lengths related to point $D$.

Let me recall the formula for the circumradius $R$ of a triangle with sides $a$, $b$, $
