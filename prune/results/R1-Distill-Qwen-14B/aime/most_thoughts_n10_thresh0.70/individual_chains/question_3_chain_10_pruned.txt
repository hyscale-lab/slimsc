Okay, so I have this probability problem about a lottery that Jen enters. Let me try to understand what's being asked here.

Jen picks 4 distinct numbers from the set S, which is {1,2,3,...,10}. Then, 4 numbers are randomly chosen from S as well. She wins a prize if at least two of her numbers match the randomly chosen numbers. She wins the grand prize if all four of her numbers match the four chosen.

We need to find the probability that she wins the grand prize given that she won a prize. The answer should be in the form of a fraction m/n where m and n are coprime, and then find m + n.

Hmm, so this is a conditional probability problem. The formula for conditional probability is P(A|B) = P(A ∩ B) / P(B). In this case, event A is winning the grand prize, and event B is winning a prize. Since winning the grand prize means she has all four numbers matching, which is a subset of winning a prize (since she must have at least two numbers matching), the intersection A ∩ B is just A. So, P(A|B) = P(A) / P(B).

So, I need to compute P(A) and P(B).

First, let's figure out the total number of ways to choose 4 numbers from 10. That's the combination of 10 choose 4, which I can calculate. Let me compute that:

Total possible combinations = C(10,4) = 10! / (4! * (10-4)!) = (10*9*8*7)/(4*3*2*1) = 210.

So, there's 210 possible sets of 4 numbers that can be chosen.

Now, P(A) is the probability that Jen's 4 numbers are exactly the 4 chosen. Since Jen picks one specific set, the number of favorable outcomes is 1 (only her set is chosen). So, P(A) = 1 / 210.

Next, P(B) is the probability that Jen wins a prize, which is when at least two of her numbers are among the four chosen.

Calculating P(B) might be a bit trickier. Since it's the probability of at least two matches, it's easier to compute the complement probability and subtract from 1.

The complement of B is that Jen has fewer than two numbers matching, i.e., zero or one number matching.

So, P(B) = 1 - P(zero matches) - P(one match).

Let me compute P(zero matches) first. This is the probability that none of Jen's four numbers are in the four chosen. So, all four chosen numbers are from the remaining 6 numbers (since S has 10 numbers, and Jen picked 4, leaving 6).

The number of ways to choose 4 numbers from 6 is C(6,4) = 15. So, the number of favorable outcomes for zero matches is 15. Hence, P(zero matches) = 15 / 210.

Now, P(one match) is the probability that exactly one of Jen's numbers is chosen, and the remaining three are from the other 6 numbers.

To compute this, we can think of it as choosing 1 number from Jen's 4, and 3 numbers from the remaining 6. So the number of favorable outcomes is C(4,1) * C(6,3).

Calculating that: C(4,1) is 4, and C(6,3) is 20. So, 4 * 20 = 80.

Therefore, the number of favorable outcomes for exactly one match is 80. So, P(one match) = 80 / 210.

Putting it together: P(B) = 1 - (15/210 + 80/210) = 1 - (95/210).

Compute 95/210: Let's see, 95/210 simplifies to 19/42, since both numerator and denominator are divisible by 5. So, 95 ÷5=19, 210 ÷5=42.

So, P(B) = 1 - 19/42 = (42/42 -19/42) = 23/42.

Wait a second, let me double-check that. If 15 + 80 = 95, and 95/210 is the probability of not winning. Then 1 - 95/210 is 115/210, which simplifies. Wait, 115 and 210 are both divisible by 5: 115 ÷5=23, 210 ÷5=42. So, 23/42. Yes, that's correct.

So, P(B) is 23/42.

Earlier, I found P(A) = 1/210.

But wait, wait. Wait, no. Wait, P(A) is the probability that all four numbers match. So, P(A) is 1/210, since there's only one favorable outcome.

But wait, is that correct? Because in the problem, Jen is picking 4 numbers, and the lottery also picks 4 numbers. So, the probability that Jen's set is exactly the same as the lottery's set is 1/C(10,4) = 1/210. So, that's correct.

But now, when computing P(A|B), we have P(A)/P(B) = (1/210) / (23/42).

Wait, let me compute that.

(1/210) divided by (23/42) is equal to (1/210) * (42/23) = (42)/(210 * 23).

Simplify 42/210: 42 divides into 210 exactly 5 times (42*5=210), so 42/210=1/5.

So, (1/210)/(23/42) = (1/5) * (1/23) )= 1/(5*23) = 1/115.

Wait, but 42/210 is 1/5, so 42/(210*23) is (1/5)/23 = 1/(5*23) = 1/115.

So, the probability P(A|B) is 1/115.

But wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the calculation. Let's go through it again.

P(A) is 1/210.

P(B) is 23/42.

So, P(A|B) = (1/210) / (23/42) = (1/210) * (42/23) = (42)/(210*23).

Simplify numerator and denominator: 42 and 210 have a common factor of 42. 42 is 42, 210 is 5*42.

So, 42/(210*23) = (1)/(5*23) = 1/115.

Yes, that seems correct.

So, the probability is 1/115. Therefore, m=1 and n=115. Are they coprime? Yes, since 115 is 5*23, and 1 shares no common factors with them.

So, m + n = 1 + 115 = 116.

Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing P(B). Because sometimes when probabilities are close, it's easy to make an error
