Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the remainder when the product from k=0 to 12 of (2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k}) is divided by 1000. Here, ω is a 13th root of unity and ω ≠ 1. Hmm, okay. Let me try to break this down step by step.

First, I remember that roots of unity have some nice properties, especially when it comes to polynomials. Since ω is a primitive 13th root of unity, it satisfies ω^13 = 1, and the minimal polynomial over the integers is the 13th cyclotomic polynomial, which is Φ₁₃(x) = x¹² + x¹¹ + ... + x + 1. But I'm not sure if that's directly useful here.

Looking at the expression inside the product: 2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k}. Let me denote this as P(k) = 2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k}. So I need to compute the product of P(k) for k from 0 to 12.

Wait, but when k=0, ω^0 = 1. So P(0) = 2 - 2*1 + 1 = 2 - 2 + 1 = 1. Okay, that's simple. So the product starts with 1, and then we multiply by terms from k=1 to 12.

Hmm, maybe I can factor this expression or find a pattern. Let me write P(k) as 2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k}. Let me see if I can factor this or rewrite it in a way that relates to cyclotomic polynomials or something else.

Alternatively, perhaps I can consider each P(k) as a quadratic in ω^k. Let me write P(k) = ω^{2k} - 2ω^k + 2. Hmm, that's a quadratic in ω^k. Let me treat x = ω^k, so P(k) becomes x² - 2x + 2.

Wait, so P(k) = x² - 2x + 2, where x is ω^k. So, for each k, we're multiplying (x² - 2x + 2) where x is ω^k. So the entire product is the product over all x ≠ 1 of (x² - 2x + 2). Because when k=0, x=1, but P(0)=1, so it doesn't affect the product.

So, the product is equal to the product over all 13th roots of unity x (excluding x=1) of (x² - 2x + 2). Hmm, wait, but x runs over all ω^k for k=0 to 12, so including x=1. But P(0)=1, so the product is equal to the product over x^13=1 of (x² - 2x + 2).

Wait, because x^13=1, so each x is
