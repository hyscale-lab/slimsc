Okay, so I've got this math problem to solve. Let me read it again and make sure I understand what's being asked.

"Let p be the least prime number for which there exists a positive integer n such that n⁴ + 1 is divisible by p². Find the least positive integer m such that m⁴ + 1 is divisible by p²."

Hmm, so first, I need to find the smallest prime p where n⁴ + 1 is divisible by p squared. Then, once I have that prime p, I need to find the smallest m where m⁴ + 1 is divisible by p².

Let me start by breaking down the problem. I think the key here is to look at primes p and see if the equation n⁴ ≡ -1 mod p² has a solution for some integer n. Since p is the smallest such prime, I should check primes in order: 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, etc., and see which is the first one that meets the condition.

First, let's consider p=2. Let me check if there's an n such that n⁴ +1 is divisible by 4. Let's compute n⁴ mod 4 for n=1, 2, 3, etc.

n=1: 1⁴=1 → 1+1=2 → 2 mod 4 is 2, not 0. So 2 doesn't divide 2.

n=2: 2⁴=16 → 16+1=17 → 17 mod 4 is 1. Not 0.

n=3: 3⁴=81 → 81+1=82 → 82 mod 4 is 2. Not 0.

n=4: 4⁴=256 → 256+1=257 → 257 mod 4 is 1.

Hmm, it seems like for p=2, n⁴ +1 is never 0 mod 4. So p=2 doesn't work.

Next, let's check p=3. I need to see if there's an n where n⁴ ≡ -1 mod 9.

First, I can compute n⁴ mod 9 for n=1 to 8 (since mod 9 cycles every 9 numbers).

n=1: 1⁴=1 → 1 mod 9 = 1. So 1 +1=2 mod9≠0.

n=2: 16 mod9=7 → 7+1=8 mod9≠0.

n=3: 81 mod9=0 → 0+1=1≠0.

n=4: 256 mod9. Let's compute 256/9=28*9=252, remainder 4. 4+1=5≠0.

n=5: 625 mod9. Let's compute 625/9=69*9=621, remainder 4. So 4+1=5≠0.

Wait, wait, 5⁴ is actually 625, but mod9, maybe there's a smarter way. Since 5 mod9=5, 5²=25 mod9=7, 5⁴=(5²)^2=7²=49 mod9=4. So 4+1=5 mod9. Not 0.

n=6: 6⁴=1296 → mod9 is 0, since 9 divides 1296. So 0+1=1≠0.

n=7: Let's compute 7 mod9=7. 7²=49 mod9=4, 7⁴=(7²)^2=4²=16 mod9=7. So 7+1=8≠0.

n=8: 8 mod9=8. 8²=64 mod9=1, so 8⁴=(8²)^2=1²=1 mod9. 1+1=2≠0.

So for p=3, there's no n with n⁴ +1 divisible by 9. So p=3 is out.

Moving on to p=5. Let me check if n⁴ +1 is divisible by 25.

So n⁴ ≡ -1 mod25.

I need to find if there exists an n such that n⁴ ≡ 24 mod25.

Let me try n from 1 to 24 (since mod25 has period 25). But maybe I can find a pattern or use some number theory.

First, note that in mod25, we can compute n⁴ for n coprime to 5, since if n is a multiple of 5, n⁴ would be 0 mod25, so n⁴ +1 would be 1 mod25, which isn't 0.

So let's check n from 1 to 24, but since n and 25 must be coprime (since otherwise n⁴ would be 0 mod25), so n must be 1,2,3,4,6,7,8,9,11,12,13,14,16,17,18,19,21,22,23,24.

But maybe that's a lot, but perhaps there's a smarter way. Maybe using Euler's theorem or primitive roots.

Euler's theorem says that for n coprime to 25, n^φ(25)=n^20 ≡1 mod25.

So, n^20 ≡1 mod25, which implies that the order of n modulo25 divides 20.

But we're looking for n^4 ≡24 mod25. Let's see if 24 is a quartic residue mod25.

Alternatively, maybe I can test some n.

Let me try n=2: 2⁴=16 mod25=16. 16+1=17≠0.

n=3: 81 mod25=6. 6+1=7≠0.

n=7: Let's compute 7²=49 mod25=24, so 7⁴=(7²)^2=24²=576 mod25. 576 divided by25 is 23*25=575, so 576 mod25=1. So 1+1=2≠0.

n=8: 8²=64 mod25=14; 8⁴=14²=196 mod25=21. 21+1=22≠0.

n=9: 9²=81 mod25=6; 9⁴=6²=36 mod25=11. 11+1=12≠0.

n=12: 12²=144 mod25=19; 12⁴=19²=361 mod25=11. 11+1=12≠0.

n=13: 13²=169 mod25=19; 13⁴=19²=361 mod25=11. 11+1=12≠0.

n=17: 17²=289 mod25=14; 17⁴=14²=196 mod25=21. 21+1=22≠0.

n=18: 18²=324 mod25=24; 18⁴=24²=576 mod25=1. 1+1=2≠0.

n=22: 22²=484 mod25=9; 22⁴=9²=81 mod25=6. 6+1=7≠0.

n=23: 23²=529 mod25=4; 23⁴=4²=16 mod25=16. 16+1=17≠0.

Hmm, none of these worked. Did I miss any? Let me try n=1: 1⁴=1; 1+1=2≠0. n=4: 4⁴=256 mod25=6. 6+1=7≠0.

Wait, maybe n=12 is giving 11, but let's double-check. 12²=144 mod25=144-5*25=144-125=19. 19²=361 mod25=11, so 12⁴=11 mod25. 11+1=12≠0.

I'm not finding any n for which n⁴ +1 is 0 mod25. So maybe p=5 doesn't work either.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake. Let me try n=7 again. 7²=49 mod25=24; so 7⁴=24²=576 mod25=576-23*25=576-575=1. So 1+1=2 mod25≠0. Right.

Hmm, maybe p=5 doesn't work, so let's try p=13. Hmm, wait, maybe p=13 is too big. Wait, perhaps I skipped p=5 and p=7. Let me try p=7.

Wait, maybe I should check p=5 first. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in testing n=22. Let me compute 22²=484 mod25: 25*19=475, so 484-475=9. So 22²=9 mod25. Then 22⁴=(22²)^2=9²=81 mod25=6. So 6+1=7 mod25≠0.

Wait, maybe I need to think differently. Since n^4 ≡ -1 mod25, then n^8 ≡1 mod25, because (-1)^2=1. So the order of n modulo25 would divide 8 and also divide φ(25)=20. So the order would divide gcd(8,20)=4. So the order could be 1,2, or 4.

If the order is 1, then n ≡1 mod25, but 1⁴=1≡1≠-1 mod25. Similarly, if the order is 2, n²≡1 mod25, so n⁴≡1²=1≡-1? That would require 1≡-1 mod25, which implies 2≡0 mod25, which isn't true. So order can't be 2.

If the order is 4, then n⁴≡1 mod25, but we need n⁴≡-1 mod25, so 1≡-1 mod25, which again implies 2≡0, which is false. So it's impossible for n^4 ≡-1 mod25. Therefore, there's no solution for p=5. So p=5 can't be the prime we're looking for.

So moving on to p=7. Let's check if n⁴ +1 is divisible by 49.

So, n⁴ ≡ -1 mod49.

Again, let's compute n⁴ mod49 for various n. Maybe I can find a solution.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use some number theory here. Let me see. Since 7 is a prime, let me see if -1 is a quartic residue mod7²=49.

First, let's check mod7. Does n⁴ ≡ -1 mod7 have a solution?

But mod7, n^4 can be:

n | n^4 mod7
0 | 0
1 | 1
2 | 16 mod7=2
3 | 81 mod7=4
4 | 256 mod7= 256 - 7*36=256-252=4 → 4 mod7
5 | 625 mod7: 625 /7=89*7=623, 625-623=2 → 2 mod7
6 | 1296 mod7: 1296 - 7*185=1296-1295=1 →1 mod7.

So n^4 mod7 can be 0,1,2,4. So -1 mod7 is 6, which is not among them. So n^4 ≡-1 mod7 has no solution. Therefore, n⁴ ≡-1 mod49 can't have a solution either, because if it did, then n⁴ ≡-1 mod7 would hold, but that's impossible. So p=7 can't be the prime.

Next prime is 13. Let me check p=13. So p²=169.

Wait, but maybe I should check p=17. Wait, maybe I should think about whether -1 is a quartic residue modulo p².

I remember that for primes p where p ≡ 1 mod4, -1 is a quadratic residue. But for quartic residues, it's more complicated.

Wait, maybe I should consider the multiplicative group mod p². The group is cyclic if p is odd and p² is the modulus. For p odd, the multiplicative group mod p² is cyclic of order p(p-1). So for p=5, it's of order 20, which is cyclic.

Wait, but earlier when I tried p=5, I saw that n^4 couldn't be ≡-1 mod25, so p=5 isn't the prime.

Wait, let's try p=17. Maybe that's the first prime where n^4 ≡-1 mod17² has a solution.

Alternatively, perhaps p=13 is the next candidate. Let me check p=13.

First, let's check mod13 if n^4 ≡-1 mod13 has a solution. Because if it doesn't, then mod13²=169 can't either.

So, mod13, n^4 ≡-1 mod13. Let's compute n^4 mod13:

n | n^4 mod13
0 |0
1 |1
2 |16 mod13=3
3 |81 mod13= 81-6*13=81-78=3
4 |256 mod13: 13*19=247, 256-247=9
5 |625 mod13: 625-48*13=625-624=1
6 |1296 mod13: Let's compute 13*99=1287, 1296-1287=9.
7 |7⁴= (7²)^2=49² mod13. 49 mod13=10, so 10²=100 mod13=9.
8 |8²=64 mod13=12, so 8⁴=12²=144 mod13=1.
9 |9²=81 mod13=3, so 9⁴=3²=9 mod13=9.
10 |10²=100 mod13=9, so 10⁴=9²=81 mod13=3.
11 |11²=121 mod13=4, so 11⁴=4²=16 mod13=3.
12 |12²=144 mod13=1, so 12⁴=1²=1 mod13=1.

So looking for n^4 ≡12 mod13 (since -1 mod13=12). From the table above, I don't see any n where n^4 ≡12 mod13.

Wait, so mod13, n^4 can be 0,1,3,9. So 12 isn't among them. Therefore, n^4 ≡-1 mod13 has no solution, so mod13², it can't either. So p=13 isn't the prime.

Hmm, this is getting time-consuming. Maybe I should look for another approach.

I remember that for a prime p, if p ≡1 mod4, then -1 is a quadratic residue mod p. But for quartic residues, it's more specific.

Wait, maybe I should recall that if p ≡1 mod8, then the multiplicative group mod p² is such that elements can have higher order.

Wait, perhaps I can use Hensel's lemma to lift solutions from mod p to mod p². But for that, I need a solution mod p first.

Wait, but as we saw, for p=5, n^4 ≡-1 mod5. Let me check that.

n^4 mod5:

n | n^4 mod5
0 |0
1 |1
2 |16 mod5=1
3 |81 mod5=1
4 |256 mod5=1.

Wait, so n^4 mod5 can only be 0 or1. So -1 mod5 is 4, which isn't achieved. So p=5 doesn't have a solution even mod5, so mod25 can't have a solution either.

Wait, but earlier, I thought that for p=5, n^4 ≡-1 mod25 had no solution, which is correct. So p=5 is out.

What about p=17? Let's check mod17.

Compute n^4 mod17 for n=1 to 16:

1:1
2:16
3:81 mod17=13
4:256 mod17=1
5:625 mod17. Let's compute: 17*36=612, 625-612=13 →13 mod17.
6:6^4=1296 mod17. Let's compute 17*76=1292, 1296-1292=4 →4 mod17.
7:7^4=2401 mod17. 17*141=2397, 2401-2397=4 →4 mod17.
8:8^4=4096 mod17. 17*241=4097, so 4096 mod17= -1 mod17=16.
Wait, 4096 divided by17: 17*241=4097, so 4096=17*241 -1, so mod17, it's -1, which is 16 mod17.

Ah! So when n=8, n^4 ≡16≡-1 mod17. So 8^4 ≡-1 mod17.

So mod17, n=8 is a solution. Now, can we lift this solution to mod17²=289 using Hensel's lemma?

Hensel's lemma says that if f(n)=n⁴ +1, and f(8)≡0 mod17, and f’(8) not≡0 mod17, then there's a unique lift mod17².

Let me compute f’(n)=4n³. So f’(8)=4*8³=4*512=2048.

Compute 2048 mod17. Let's see: 17*120=2040, so 2048-2040=8 →8 mod17≠0. So f’(8)≡8 mod17≠0. So by Hensel's lemma, there's a unique solution mod17² which lifts 8.

So, there exists an integer m≡8 mod17 such that m⁴ ≡-1 mod289.

Therefore, p=17 is the smallest prime where such an m exists. Because earlier primes like 2,3,5,7,13 didn't work.

So now, the problem asks for the least positive integer m such that m⁴ +1 is divisible by p², where p=17. So we need to find the smallest m where m⁴ ≡-1 mod289.

We know that m ≡8 mod17. So let me let m=8 +17k, where k is an integer we need to find.

Then, m⁴ ≡-1 mod289.

Let me compute m=8 +17k. Let's compute m⁴ mod289.

First, compute (8 +17k)^4. Let's expand this using the binomial theorem.

=8^4 + 4*8³*(17k) + 6*8²*(17k)^2 + 4*8*(17k)^3 + (17k)^4.

But since we're mod289=17², any term with (17k)^2 or higher power will be 0 mod289. So only the first two terms matter.

So m⁴ ≡8^4 + 4*8³*(17k) mod289.

Compute 8^4: 8²=64, 8^4=64²=4096. Now 4096 mod289.

Compute 289*14=4046, which is bigger than 4096. Let's try 289*13=3757. 4096-3757=339.

Wait, 289*14=4046, which is more than 4096. So 289*14=4046, 4096-4046=50. So 8^4 ≡50 mod289.

Now, compute 4*8³*(17k). 8³=512. 4*512=2048. 2048*(17k)= 34816k.

Now, 34816 mod289. Let's compute 289*120=34680. 34816-34680=136. So 34816k ≡136k mod289.

So m⁴ ≡50 + 136k mod289.

We need m⁴ ≡-1 mod289. So:

50 + 136k ≡-1 mod289 → 136k ≡-51 mod289.

Simplify: 136k ≡238 mod289 (since -51 mod289 is 238).

We can write this as 136k ≡238 mod289.

Let me compute gcd(136,289) to see if a solution exists.

136 factors: 17*8=136.

289 is 17². So gcd is 17.

Since 17 divides 238 (238=17*14), there are solutions.

We can divide the equation by 17:

(136/17)k ≡238/17 mod289/17 → 8k ≡14 mod17.

So 8k ≡14 mod17.

Now, find k: 8k ≡14 mod17.

Multiplicative inverse of 8 mod17: 8*2=16≡-1, so 8*15=120≡120-7*17=120-119=1. So inverse is15.

So k ≡14*15 mod17.

14*15=210. 210 mod17: 17*12=204, 210-204=6 →k≡6 mod17.

So k=6 +17t, where t is an integer. Since we're looking for the smallest positive m, let's take t=0, so k=6.

So m=8 +17*6=8+102=110.

Wait, but let me check if m=110 satisfies m⁴ +1 ≡0 mod289.

Compute 110 mod17: 110/17=6*17=102, so 110=102+8≡8 mod17, which is correct.

Compute m=110: m⁴=110^4.

But instead, let's compute it modulo289.

We can use the expansion again, but since m=8+17*6=8+102=110, which is 8 mod17, but we need to compute m⁴ mod289.

Alternatively, since we already have m=8+17k with k=6, let's compute m⁴ mod289.

Wait, but earlier we had m⁴ ≡50 +136k mod289. So with k=6, that would be 50 +136*6.

136*6=816. Now, 816 mod289: 289*2=578, 816-578=238.

So 50 +238=288. 288 mod289 is -1. So yes, m⁴ ≡-1 mod289.

So m=110 is a solution. But wait, is 110 the smallest positive integer that satisfies this?

Wait, let me check m=8. Earlier, we saw that n=8 is a solution mod17, but does it work mod289?

Compute 8⁴=4096. 4096 mod289: 289*14=4046, so 4096-4046=50. So 8⁴=50 mod289. 50 +1=51≠0 mod289. So 8 doesn't work.

Next, let's check m=8+17=25. Compute 25⁴ mod289.

25²=625 mod289: 289*2=578, 625-578=47.

25⁴=(25²)^2=47²=2209 mod289.

Compute 289*7=2023, 2209-2023=186.

186 mod289=186. 186 +1=187≠0 mod289. So 25 doesn't work.

Next, m=8+2*17=42. Compute 42⁴ mod289.

42²=1764 mod289. Let's compute 289*6=1734. 1764-1734=30. So 42²≡30 mod289.

42⁴=(30)^2=900 mod289. 289*3=867, 900-867=33. 33 +1=34≠0 mod289.

Next, m=8+3*17=59. Compute 59⁴ mod289.

59 mod289=59. 59²=3481. 3481 mod289: 289*12=3468, 3481-3468=13. So 59²≡13 mod289.

59⁴=(13)^2=169 mod289. 169 +1=170≠0 mod289.

Next, m=8+4*17=76. Compute 76⁴ mod289.

76 mod289=76. 76²=5776. 5776 mod289: 289*20=5780, so 5776-5780=-4≡285 mod289.

76⁴=(285)^2. Let's compute 285²=81225.

Compute 289*280=289*280= (289*28)*10= (8092)*10=80920.

81225 - 80920=305. 305 mod289=305-289=16. So 76⁴≡16 mod289. 16 +1=17≠0.

Next, m=8+5*17=93. Compute 93⁴ mod289.

93 mod289=93. 93²=8649. 8649 mod289: 289*30=8670. 8649 is less than that. 289*29=8381, 8649-8381=268. So 93²≡268 mod289.

93⁴=(268)^2=71824. Compute 71824 mod289.

First, find how many times 289 goes into 71824. Alternatively, note that 289*248= let's see, 289*200=57800, 289*48=13872, so 57800+13872=71672. 71824-71672=152. So 268²≡152 mod289.

152 +1=153≠0 mod289.

Next, m=8+6*17=110. As before, 110⁴≡-1 mod289. So 110 works.

But wait, maybe there's a smaller m than 110 that works. Let's check m=8+17*6=110, but perhaps we can find a smaller k.

Wait, in our earlier calculation, when solving 8k ≡14 mod17, we found k≡6 mod17. So the smallest positive k is 6, so m=8 +17*6=110. So m=110 is the smallest positive integer satisfying m⁴ +1 ≡0 mod289.

Wait, but let me check m=8+17*6=110. Let me compute 110 mod17: 110=6*17 +8 →110≡8 mod17. Correct.

Alternatively, let's see if there's a smaller m. For example, m=8+17*6=110, but perhaps m=110 -289= -179, but that's negative. So 110 is the smallest positive solution.

Wait, but earlier, when I tried m=8,25,42,59,76,93,110, only 110 worked. So 110 is indeed the minimal positive integer.

Wait a second, but let me verify m=110.

Compute 110^4 +1 mod289.

Compute 110 mod289=110.

Compute 110^2=12100. 12100 mod289: Let's find how many times 289 fits into 12100.

Compute 289*41=289*40=11560 +289=11849. 12100-11849=251. So 110²≡251 mod289.

Now, 110^4=(110²)^2=251²=63001. Now, 63001 mod289.

Compute 289*217= let's see, 289*200=57800, 289*17=4913. 57800+4913=62713.

63001 -62713=288. So 63001 mod289=288. So 110^4 ≡288 mod289, which is -1 mod289. So 110^4 +1 ≡-1 +1=0 mod289. So yes, 110 works.

Is there a smaller m than 110? Let's check m=8+17*6=110, but perhaps there's a smaller m with m≡8 mod17.

Wait, the next smaller m would be 8 +17*(-1)= -9, which is negative, so not positive. The next is 8 +17*0=8, which didn't work. So 110 is the minimal positive integer.

Wait, but let me double-check. Maybe I made a mistake in the Hensel's lemma step.

Wait, we had m=8 +17k, and we found k=6 mod17, so the smallest k is 6, leading to m=110. But perhaps the minimal solution is smaller. Let me think.

Wait, another approach: since m is ≡8 mod17, the possible m's are 8,25,42,59,76,93,110,... up to 289.

We saw that up to m=110, only m=110 worked. So 110 is the least positive integer m such that m⁴ +1 is divisible by 289.

Thus, the answer is m=110.


To solve the problem, we need to find the smallest prime \( p \) such that there exists a positive integer \( n \) where \( n^4 + 1 \) is divisible by \( p^2 \). Then, we determine the least positive integer \( m \) for which \( m^4 + 1 \) is divisible by \( p^2 \).

### Step 1: Identify the smallest prime \( p \)
We start by checking primes sequentially:

1. **\( p = 2 \)**: Testing \( n = 1, 2, 3, \ldots \) shows no \( n \) satisfies \( n^4 + 1 \equiv 0 \mod 4 \).
2. **\( p = 3 \)**: Testing \( n = 1, 2, \ldots, 8 \) modulo 9 shows no \( n \) satisfies \( n^4 + 1 \equiv 0 \mod 9 \).
3. **\( p = 5 \)**: Testing \( n = 1, 2, \ldots, 24 \) modulo 25 shows no \( n \) satisfies \( n^4 + 1 \equiv 0 \mod 25 \).
4. **\( p = 7 \)**: Testing \( n = 1, 2, \ldots, 6 \) modulo 7 shows no \( n \) satisfies \( n^4 + 1 \equiv 0 \mod 7 \). Hence, no solution modulo \( 49 \).
5. **\( p = 17 \)**: Testing \( n = 1, 2, \ldots, 16 \) modulo 17, we find \( n = 8 \) satisfies \( 8^4 \equiv -1 \mod 17 \). Using Hensel's lemma, we lift this solution to modulo \( 17^2 = 289 \).

### Step 2: Find the least \( m \) for \( p = 17 \)
We seek \( m \) such that \( m^4 + 1 \equiv 0 \mod 289 \) and \( m \equiv 8 \mod 17 \). Let \( m = 8 + 17k \). Expanding \( m^4 \) modulo 289 and solving for \( k \), we find \( k = 6 \). Thus, \( m = 8 + 17 \times 6 = 110 \).

### Conclusion
The smallest prime \( p \) is 17, and the least positive integer \( m \) satisfying the condition is:

\boxed{110}
