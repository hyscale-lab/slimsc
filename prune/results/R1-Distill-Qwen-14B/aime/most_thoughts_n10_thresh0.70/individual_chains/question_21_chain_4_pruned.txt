Okay, so I need to solve this problem about b-eautiful integers. Let me try to understand what exactly a b-eautiful number is. 

From the problem statement, a positive integer n is called b-eautiful if two conditions are met:
1. When n is written in base b, it has exactly two digits.
2. The sum of these two digits equals the square root of n.

The example given is 81 is 13-eautiful because in base 13, 81 is written as 63, and 6 + 3 = 9, which is sqrt(81). 

So, I need to find the least integer b (where b is at least 2) such that there are more than ten b-eautiful integers. That means, for this base b, there should be at least 11 numbers n that satisfy the two conditions mentioned.

Let me break down what it means for n to have exactly two digits in base b. In base b, a two-digit number is of the form d1 * b + d0, where d1 and d0 are digits in base b. Since it's a two-digit number, d1 can't be zero. So, d1 is from 1 to b-1, and d0 is from 0 to b-1.

Therefore, n can be written as:
n = d1 * b + d0

Additionally, the sum of the digits d1 + d0 should equal sqrt(n). So, we have:
d1 + d0 = sqrt(n)

But since n = d1 * b + d0, substituting the expression for sqrt(n) gives:
d1 + d0 = sqrt(d1 * b + d0)

Let me write that equation again:
d1 + d0 = sqrt(d1 * b + d0)

To make this easier, let's square both sides to eliminate the square root:
(d1 + d0)^2 = d1 * b + d0

Expanding the left side:
d1^2 + 2*d1*d0 + d0^2 = d1*b + d0

Let me rearrange this equation to bring all terms to one side:
d1^2 + 2*d1*d0 + d0^2 - d1*b - d0 = 0

Hmm, that's a quadratic in terms of d1 and d0. Maybe I can rearrange it differently. Let me group terms:

d1^2 + (2*d0 - b)*d1 + (d0^2 - d0) = 0

This is a quadratic equation in d1. For each d0, I can solve for d1. But since d1 and d0 are digits, their values are limited. d1 must be between 1 and b-1, and d0 between 0 and b-1.

Alternatively, maybe I can express this equation in a different way. Let me try subtracting d1*b and d0 from both sides again:

d1^2 + 2*d1*d0 + d0^2 = d1*b + d0

Wait, perhaps factor the left side. It looks similar to (d1 + d0)^2, which is correct because (d1 + d0)^2 = d1^2 + 2*d1*d0 + d0^2. So, indeed, we have:

(d1 + d0)^2 = d1*b + d0

Let me denote s = d1 + d0. Then the equation becomes:
s^2 = d1*b + d0

But since d1 = s - d0, substituting into the equation:
s^2 = (s - d0)*b + d0
s^2 = s*b - d0*b + d0
s^2 = s*b + d0*(1 - b)

Hmm, let's solve for d0:
d0*(1 - b) = s^2 - s*b
d0 = (s^2 - s*b)/(1 - b)

Wait, 1 - b is negative since b >=2. Maybe factor out a negative sign to make it clearer:
d0 = (s^2 - s*b)/(- (b - 1)) 
d0 = (s*b - s^2)/(b - 1)

So, that's:
d0 = s*(b - s)/(b - 1)

Since d0 must be an integer between 0 and b-1, and s is the sum of two digits, which are d1 and d0. Since d1 is at least 1 and d0 is at least 0, s is at least 1. Also, d1 is at most b-1 and d0 is at most b-1, so s is at most 2*(b-1). But actually, since n is a two-digit number in base b, the maximum value of n is (b-1)*b + (b-1) = b^2 -1. So sqrt(n) is at most sqrt(b^2 -1) â‰ˆ b. But since s = sqrt(n), s can be up to b.

Wait, but s is d1 + d0, which is at most (b-1) + (b-1) = 2b - 2. But s is also sqrt(n), which is <= sqrt(b^2 -1) < b. So s can be up to b-1, since sqrt(b^2 -1) is just a bit less than b.

Wait,
