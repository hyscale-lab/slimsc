Okay, so I have this problem to solve. It says: Let p be the least prime number for which there exists a positive integer n such that n⁴ + 1 is divisible by p². Then, I need to find the least positive integer m such that m⁴ + 1 is divisible by p². 

Hmm, okay, let's break this down. First, I need to find the smallest prime p where n⁴ ≡ -1 mod p² for some n. Then, once I find that p, I have to find the smallest m where m⁴ ≡ -1 mod p².

I remember that for primes, certain conditions must hold for equations like x² ≡ -1 mod p. For example, -1 is a quadratic residue modulo p if and only if p ≡ 1 mod 4. But here, we're dealing with the fourth power, so maybe similar logic applies but with higher exponents.

Wait, but the problem is about divisibility by p², not just p. So it's not just about whether -1 is a fourth power modulo p, but whether it's a fourth power modulo p². That might be a bit trickier.

First, let's consider the prime p. We need p² divides n⁴ + 1 for some n. So n⁴ ≡ -1 mod p². Since n⁴ ≡ -1 mod p² implies n⁴ ≡ -1 mod p as well. So first, let's consider whether -1 is a fourth power modulo p. 

For -1 to be a fourth power modulo p, it must be a square and a quadratic residue. Wait, no, fourth power implies that it's a square of a square, so first, it must be a square modulo p. Therefore, (-1) must be a quadratic residue modulo p, which as I thought earlier, happens when p ≡ 1 mod 4.

But that's just the condition for modulo p. What about modulo p²? Because if n⁴ ≡ -1 mod p², then certainly n⁴ ≡ -1 mod p. But even if that's true, does it imply that n⁴ ≡ -1 mod p²?

I think there's a concept called Hensel's lemma which might help here. Hensel's lemma is about lifting solutions from modulo p to higher powers of p. But I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact conditions. I think it says that if f(n) ≡ 0 mod p and f'(n) not ≡ 0 mod p, then there's a unique lift modulo p². But for higher exponents, maybe we need certain conditions.

Alternatively, maybe I should look for primes p where the multiplicative order of n modulo p² is 8. Because if n⁴ ≡ -1 mod p², then n⁸ ≡ 1 mod p², so the order would divide 8 but not 4. So the order of n modulo p² would be 8, which implies that 8 divides p² - 1 because the multiplicative group modulo p² is cyclic of order p(p-1). Wait, is that right? Let me
