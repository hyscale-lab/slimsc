Okay, so I've got this problem here where I need to find the number of intersections between two graphs. The graphs are defined by the equations:

1. \( y = 4g(f(\sin(2\pi x))) \)
2. \( x = 4g(f(\cos(3\pi y))) \)

First, let me make sure I understand the functions involved. The functions f and g are defined as:

- \( f(x) = ||x| - 1/2| \)
- \( g(x) = ||x| - 1/4| \)

Hmm, okay. So both f and g are absolute value functions with some transformations. I think I need to break this down step by step.

Let me start by understanding f(x). Since f is defined as ||x| - 1/2|, this is a double absolute value function. Let me try to sketch or visualize what this looks like.

The inner part is |x|, which is a V-shaped graph with its vertex at (0,0). Then we subtract 1/2, so that becomes |x| - 1/2. This shifts the graph down by 1/2 unit. Now, taking the absolute value of that, ||x| - 1/2|, will reflect any part of the graph that's below the x-axis back up. So, where was |x| - 1/2 negative? That happens where |x| < 1/2, so between -1/2 and 1/2 on the x-axis.

So, initially, |x| - 1/2 is positive when |x| >= 1/2 and negative when |x| < 1/2. Taking absolute value again will flip the negative part. So the graph of f(x) will be V-shaped with the vertex at (0, 0), but between x = -1/2 and x = 1/2, the graph will be a V pointing upwards again. Wait, actually, no. Let's think carefully.

Wait, let me compute f(x) for different ranges. Let's consider x >=0, since the functions are even (symmetric about y-axis), so I can just analyze x >=0 and mirror it.

For x >=0:

f(x) = ||x| - 1/2| = |x - 1/2|

Wait, no, that's not correct. Because |x| is x when x >=0, so f(x) = |x - 1/2| when x >=0. Similarly for x <0, it's the same as x >=0 because of the outer absolute value.

Wait, no. Wait, let me correct that. Let me compute f(x) properly.

For any x, compute |x|, subtract 1/2, then take absolute value.

So, |x| can be written as:

- For x >=0, |x| = x
- For x <0, |x| = -x

So, f(x) = ||x| - 1/2|.

So, for x >=0:

f(x) = |x - 1/2|

Which is a V-shape with vertex at x=1/2, y=0, opening upwards.

Similarly, for x <0:

f(x) = |(-x) - 1/2| = |-x -1/2| = |x + 1/2|

Which is a V-shape with vertex at x=-1/2, y=0, opening upwards.

So, overall, f(x) is a piecewise function:

f(x) = |x - 1/2| for x >=0

f(x) = |x + 1/2| for x <0

So, the graph is two V-shapes, one on the right side starting at (1/2, 0) and one on the left starting at (-1/2, 0), both opening upwards.

Similarly, let's look at g(x) = ||x| - 1/4|.

Same approach: for x >=0, g(x) = |x - 1/4|, which is a V-shape with vertex at (1/4, 0). For x <0, g(x) = |x +1/4|, vertex at (-1/4, 0), opening upwards.

So, g(x) is similar but with a smaller shift.

Now, the functions inside the compositions are f(sin(2πx)) and g(f(...)).

Wait, the first function is y = 4g(f(sin(2πx))). Let me try to parse this.

So, y is 4 times g composed with f composed with sin(2πx).

Similarly, the second equation is x = 4g(f(cos(3πy))).

So, both sides are functions involving compositions of f and g with sin and cos, respectively.

The problem is to find the number of intersection points between these two graphs: y = 4g(f(sin(2πx))) and x =4g(f(cos(3πy))).

An intersection occurs when (x, y) satisfies both equations, so substituting one into the other.

So, if y satisfies y = 4g(f(sin(2πx))), and x satisfies x =4g(f(cos(3πy))), substituting y into the second equation, we get x =4g(f(cos(3π * y))), and since y is expressed in terms of x, the equations are linked.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to consider that each equation defines a relation between x and y, and their intersection points are the solutions to the system.

But this
