Okay, so I've got this math problem here, and I need to figure out how many residents of Aimeville own all four things: a diamond ring, a set of golf clubs, a garden spade, and a bag of candy hearts. Let me see, how do I approach this?

First, let me restate the problem in my own words to make sure I understand it. There are 900 residents. Each resident owns a bag of candy hearts. Then, some of them also own a diamond ring, some own golf clubs, and some own a garden spade. Additionally, there are 437 residents who own exactly two of these items, and 234 who own exactly three. I need to find how many own all four.

Hmm, okay. So it's a problem about sets and their overlaps. I remember something about inclusion-exclusion principles from my math class. Maybe I can apply that here. Let me think about how inclusion-exclusion works for multiple sets.

Wait, but in this case, we have four sets: diamond ring (let's say D), golf clubs (G), garden spade (S), and candy hearts (C). But wait a second, the problem says "each of the 900 residents owns a bag of candy hearts." So that means that C is actually universal; everyone owns a candy heart. So for the candy hearts, it's like everyone is already in that set. That might simplify things because it means that the total number of people is 900, so all numbers we're dealing with are subsets of that.

So the problem reduces to three sets: D, G, S, but with the universal set being C. But since C is universal, it's like everything happens within the 900. So maybe I can model this using the inclusion-exclusion principle for three sets, but with the total number being 900.

Wait, but another way to think about it is that each person owns at least C, so the other three items are optional. So the problem is about the overlaps between D, G, S within the 900.

Let me try to think of it step by step. The total number of people is 900. Each person owns at least C, but may also own D, G, or S. So the problem is about how these D, G, S are distributed among the 9
