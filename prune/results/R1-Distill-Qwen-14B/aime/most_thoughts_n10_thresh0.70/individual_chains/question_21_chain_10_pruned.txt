Okay, so I've got this problem here about b-eautiful numbers. Let me try to understand it first. 

The problem says: For an integer b ≥ 2, a positive integer n is called b-eautiful if two conditions are met. First, when n is expressed in base b, it has exactly two digits. Second, the sum of these two digits equals the square root of n. For example, 81 is 13-eautiful because in base 13, 81 is written as 63 (which is 6*13 + 3), and 6+3 equals 9, which is the square root of 81.

Our goal is to find the smallest integer b (where b is at least 2) such that there are more than ten b-eautiful numbers. 

Alright, let's break this down. 

First, let's understand what it means for a number to have exactly two digits in base b. A two-digit number in base b is any number n such that b ≤ n < b². Because the first digit can't be zero, the smallest two-digit number is b (which is 1*b + 0), and the largest is b² - 1 (which is (b-1)*b + (b-1)). 

So, n can be written as n = a*b + c, where a and c are digits in base b. That means a can be from 1 to b-1, and c can be from 0 to b-1. 

The second condition is that the sum of the digits a + c equals sqrt(n). So, in mathematical terms, a + c = sqrt(n). But since n = a*b + c, we can write sqrt(a*b + c) = a + c.

Let me write that equation down:

sqrt(a*b + c) = a + c

We can square both sides to eliminate the square root:

a*b + c = (a + c)^2

Let me rearrange this equation:

(a + c)^2 - a*b - c = 0

Hmm, perhaps I can write this as a quadratic in terms of a or c. Let me see.

Let's expand the left side:

a² + 2ac + c² - a*b - c = 0

Let me group terms with a:

a² + (2c - b)*a + (c² - c) = 0

Now, this is a quadratic equation in terms of a. So, for given values of b and c, we can solve for a. 

But wait, since a and c are digits in base b, a must satisfy 1 ≤ a ≤ b-1 and 0 ≤ c ≤ b-1. So, for each b, we can iterate over possible c values and see if the quadratic equation in a has integer solutions within the valid range of a.

Alternatively, since a and c are both non-negative integers with the above constraints, maybe it's easier to fix b and then find all possible pairs (a, c) that satisfy the equation.

Let me think about how to approach this systematically. 

Given that a and c are digits, for a given b, c can range from 0 to b-1. For each c, we can solve for a. Since a must be an integer between 1 and b-1, we can see if the quadratic equation yields a valid a.

But perhaps another approach is better. Let me consider that:

n = a*b + c

and sqrt(n) = a + c.

So, sqrt(n) = a + c, meaning n = (a + c)^2.

So, substituting into n = a*b + c, we get:

(a + c)^2 = a*b + c

Let me rearrange this:

(a + c)^2 - a*b - c = 0

Hmm, perhaps factor this differently. Let me subtract a*b from both sides:

(a + c)^2 - a*b = c

Wait, maybe factor out a from the first two terms:

a*(a + c - b) + c² = c

Hmm, not sure if that helps. Alternatively, let's rearrange the equation:

(a + c)^2 = a*b + c

Expanding the left side:

a² + 2ac + c² = a*b + c

Bring everything to one side:

a² + (2c - b)a + (c² - c) = 0

So, as before, this is quadratic in a. The quadratic equation is:

a² + (2c - b)a + (c² - c) = 0

For each c, we can compute the discriminant and see if a is an integer within the valid range.

The discriminant D of this quadratic in a is:

D = (2c - b)^2 - 4*1*(c² - c)

Let me compute D:

D = 4c² - 4b c + b² - 4c² + 4c

Simplify:

D = (4c² - 4c²) + (-4b c) + (b² +4c)

So,

D = b² -4b c +4c

Hmm, interesting. That simplifies to:

D = b² -4b c +4c = b² +4c(1 - b)

Wait, maybe factor it as:

D = b² -4c(b - 1)

Hmm, but let me double-check my calculation.

Wait, original discriminant:

D = (2c - b)^2 - 4*(c² - c)

= 4c² -4b c + b² -4c² +4c

Yes, that's correct. So the 4c² cancels, so we have:

D = (-4b c +4c) + b² = 4c(1 - b) + b²

So,

D = b² +4c(1 - b) = b² -4c(b -1)

So, D must be a perfect square for a to be integer, because a = [-(2c - b) ± sqrt(D)] / 2

Wait, but a must be a positive integer, so sqrt(D) must be an integer, and the numerator must be even.

So, for each c, we can compute D and see if it's a perfect square, then solve
