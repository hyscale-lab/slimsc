Okay, so I have this geometry problem here. Let me try to break it down step by step. 

First, I'm given three points: O at (0,0), A at (1/2, 0), and B at (0, sqrt(3)/2). I need to consider the family F of segments PQ where each PQ is of unit length, lies in the first quadrant, with P on the x-axis and Q on the y-axis. So, each PQ is a line segment starting on the x-axis, ending on the y-axis, and having length 1. 

The problem states there's a unique point C on AB, different from A and B, that doesn't lie on any other segment from F except AB. Then I need to find OC squared, which is the square of the distance from the origin to point C, and express it as a fraction p/q where p and q are coprime, then find p + q.

Alright, let me visualize this. The points O, A, and B form a triangle in the first quadrant. AB is a line segment from (1/2, 0) to (0, sqrt(3)/2). I can probably find the equation of AB first. 

To find the equation of AB, let's compute the slope. The slope m is (y2 - y1)/(x2 - x1) = (sqrt(3)/2 - 0)/(0 - 1/2) = (sqrt(3)/2)/(-1/2) = -sqrt(3). So the slope is -sqrt(3). 

Using point-slope form with point A (1/2, 0): y - 0 = -sqrt(3)(x - 1/2). So the equation is y = -sqrt(3)x + sqrt(3)/2. That's the equation of AB.

Now, the family F consists of segments PQ of length 1, with P on the x-axis and Q on the y-axis. So each PQ can be represented as from (p, 0) to (0, q), where p and q are positive numbers such that the distance between them is 1. 

The distance between (p,0) and (0,q) is sqrt(p^2 + q^2) = 1, so p^2 + q^2 = 1. That's the equation they satisfy. So for each p, q is sqrt(1 - p^2), but since we're in the first quadrant, both p and q are positive.

So each PQ is a line segment from (p,0) to (0, sqrt(1 - p^2)). The equation of such a segment can be found parametrically or in slope-intercept form.

Let me find the equation of the line PQ. The line passes through (p, 0) and (0, q), so the slope is (q - 0)/(0 - p) = -q/p. So the equation is y = (-q/p)x + q.

Alternatively, since q = sqrt(1 - p^2), the equation becomes y = (-sqrt(1 - p^2)/p)x + sqrt(1 - p^2).

Now, the family F consists of all such lines for p in (0,1). Each PQ is a line segment, but when considering the entire line, it's valid for all real x, but in our case, we're only considering the segment between (p,0) and (0,q). 

But when considering whether point C is on any PQ from F, we're interested in whether C lies on the line PQ for some p. Because if it does, then C would be on that segment if it's between (p,0) and (0,q). 

But the problem says that C is on AB and doesn't lie on any other segment from F except AB. So, for C to not lie on any other PQ, the equation of AB must intersect each PQ line only at C, and perhaps at another point, but the segment PQ doesn't pass through C except when PQ is AB itself.

Wait, but AB is one of these PQ segments? Let me check: AB is from (1/2, 0) to (0, sqrt(3)/2). Let's see if this satisfies the unit length condition. The distance from (1/2,0) to (0, sqrt(3)/2) is sqrt( (1/2)^2 + (sqrt(3)/2)^2 ) = sqrt(1/4 + 3/4) = sqrt(1) = 1. Yes, so AB is indeed a member of F. So the point C is on AB and not on any other PQ from F.

So, essentially, we need to find point C on AB such that no other PQ from F passes through C. So, for all other p (i.e., p ≠ 1/2), the line PQ doesn't pass through C.

So, to find such a C, we can think of it as a point on AB that is not on any other PQ line. So, for the point C = (x,y) on AB, we need that the equation y = (-sqrt(1 - p^2)/p)x + sqrt(1 - p^2) does not hold for any p ≠ 1/2.

Wait, but how do we ensure that? Perhaps I can think in terms of the envelope of the family of lines F. The envelope is a curve that is tangent to each member of the family at some point. Points on the envelope are points where each line is tangent to the envelope, so for each point on the envelope, there is exactly one line in the family passing through it. 

So, if C is on the envelope of F, then it's only on AB and one other PQ line. But we want C to be on AB and not on any other PQ. Therefore, perhaps C is the point where AB is tangent to the envelope of F. Because if AB is tangent to the envelope, then at that point, AB is the only PQ line passing through C.

Alternatively, maybe C is the point where AB intersects the envelope of F. Hmm.

Wait, the envelope of the family F of lines y = (-sqrt(1 - p^2)/p)x + sqrt(1 - p^2) can be found using standard methods. The envelope is a curve such that each line in F is tangent to it.

The standard method to find the envelope is to consider F(p, x, y) = y + (sqrt(1 - p^2)/p)x - sqrt(1 - p^2) = 0, and then compute the derivative with respect to p and set it to zero.

Alternatively, maybe parametrize it as F(p) = y = (-sqrt(1 - p^2)/p)x + sqrt(1 - p^2).

Let me write the equation as F(p, x, y) = y + (sqrt(1 - p^2)/p)x - sqrt(1 - p^2) = 0.

To find the envelope, we need to solve F(p, x, y) = 0 and dF/dp = 0.

Compute dF/dp:

dF/dp = [ ( derivative of sqrt(1-p^2) ) * x / p - sqrt(1-p^2)/p ] + [ derivative of sqrt(1-p^2) * (-1) ].

Wait, let me compute it properly.

F(p, x, y) = y + (sqrt(1 - p^2)/p) x - sqrt(1 - p^2).

Compute the partial derivative of F with respect to p:

dF/dp = [ ( derivative of sqrt(1 - p^2) ) * x / p ] + [ sqrt(1 - p^2) * (-1) / p^2 ] + [ derivative of (-sqrt(1 - p^2)) ].

Wait, maybe better to compute step by step.

Let me denote F(p) as:
