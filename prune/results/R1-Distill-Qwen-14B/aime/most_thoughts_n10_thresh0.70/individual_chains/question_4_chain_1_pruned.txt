Okay, so I need to solve this problem where Alice and Bob are playing a game with a stack of n tokens. They take turns, Alice first. Each turn, a player can remove either 1 or 4 tokens. The person who takes the last token wins. The question is to find how many positive integers n ≤ 2024 make Bob the winner with the right strategy, regardless of how Alice plays.

Hmm, right. So, I think this is a combinatorial game theory problem. Probably involves figuring out winning and losing positions. A position is a losing position if the player whose turn it is can't force a win, assuming the opponent plays optimally.

So, I should model this as a series of positions where each position is either a winning (N-position) or losing position (P-position). The idea is that if from a position, all possible moves lead to a winning position for the opponent, then the current position is losing. Otherwise, it's winning.

Let me try to figure out the pattern.

Let's define:

- If n = 0, that's an invalid position because there are no tokens left. But I think the last person to take a token wins, so if n=0, the game is over.

Wait, actually, the game ends when someone takes the last token. So, n=0 is a losing position because the player whose turn it is can't make a move and thus loses.

But in our case, the game starts with n ≥1, so n=0 is a losing position.

So, for each n ≥1, we can determine if it's a winning or losing position.

Let's create a table for small n and see if we can find a pattern.

n | outcome (W for winning, L for losing)
--- | ---
0 | L (losing)
1 | ?
2 | ?
3 | ?
4 | ?
5 | ?
6 | ?
7 | ?
8 | ?
9 | ?
10 | ?
... | ...

Let's compute the outcomes step by step.

n=0: L (base case)

n=1: The player can take 1 token and win. So W.

n=2: The player can take 1 token, leaving n=1 for the opponent, which is a W position. Wait, but if the player takes 1, opponent is at W, which is bad because opponent can win. Alternatively, can the player take 4? No, because n=2, so taking 4 isn't possible. So the player can only take 1, leaving n=1 which is a W for the opponent. So, does that mean n=2 is a losing position? Wait, no. Wait, the player can take 1, opponent gets n=1 and can take it to win. So if the current player takes 1, opponent wins. So n=2 is a losing position? Or is it a winning position because the player can make a move?

Wait, no. The definition is: a position is losing if every possible move leads to a winning position for the opponent. So, if from n=2, the player can only take 1, leading to n=1 (W for opponent), then n=2 is a losing position for the current player. So n=2 is L.

Wait, let me think again. The player's goal is to win. If all moves from n=2 lead to the opponent winning,
