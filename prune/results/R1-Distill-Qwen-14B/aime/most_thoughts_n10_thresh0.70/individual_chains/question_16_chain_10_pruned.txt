Okay, so I've got this math problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again:

"Let \( p \) be the least prime number for which there exists a positive integer \( n \) such that \( n^{4} + 1 \) is divisible by \( p^{2} \). Find the least positive integer \( m \) such that \( m^{4} + 1 \) is divisible by \( p^{2} \)."

Alright, so the goal is to find the smallest prime \( p \) where \( p^2 \) divides \( n^4 + 1 \) for some integer \( n \). Then, once we find that \( p \), we need the smallest \( m \) such that \( m^4 + 1 \) is divisible by \( p^2 \).

First, I should probably start by testing small primes to see if any satisfy the condition that \( n^4 + 1 \equiv 0 \mod p^2 \) for some \( n \).

Let me list the primes in order: 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, etc. I'll check each one to see if \( n^4 + 1 \) can be divisible by \( p^2 \).

Starting with \( p = 2 \):

Check if \( n^4 + 1 \) is divisible by \( 4 \). Let's compute \( n^4 +1 \mod 4 \). For any integer \( n \), \( n \) is either even or odd.

If \( n \) is even, say \( n = 2k \), then \( n^4 = (2k)^4 = 16k^4 \equiv 0 \mod 4 \). So \( n^4 +1 \equiv 1 \mod 4 \).

If \( n \) is odd, say \( n = 2k + 1 \), then \( n^4 = (2k+1)^4 \). Expanding this, all terms except the last will be multiples of 4. The last term is 1, so \( n^4 \equiv 1 \mod 4 \). Thus, \( n^4 +1 \equiv 2 \mod 4 \).

In both cases, \( n^4 +1 \) is either 1 or 2 mod 4, so it's never divisible by 4. Therefore, \( p = 2 \) doesn't work.

Next prime: \( p = 3 \).

Check if \( n^4 + 1 \equiv 0 \mod 9 \).

Compute \( n^4 \mod 9 \). Let's list \( n \) from 0 to 8 and compute \( n^4 \mod 9 \):

0^4 = 0 mod 9
1^4 = 1 mod 9
2^4 = 16 mod 9 = 7
3^4 = 81 mod 9 = 0
4^4 = (4^2)^2 = 16^2 = 256 mod 9. Let's compute 256 /9: 9*28=252, 256-252=4. So 4 mod 9.
5^4: 5^2=25 mod9=7; 7^2=49 mod9=4.
6^4: 6^2=36 mod9=0, so 0.
7^4: same as (-2)^4= 16 mod9=7.
8^4: same as (-1)^4=1 mod9=1.

So the possible residues of \( n^4 \) mod 9 are 0,1,4,7.

So \( n^4 +1 \) mod9 would be:

If \( n^4 =0\), then \( 0 +1 =1 \mod9 \)
If \( n^4=1 \), then 2 mod9
If \( n^4=4 \), then 5 mod9
If \( n^4=7 \), then 8 mod9

None of these are 0 mod9. Therefore, \( n^4 +1 \) is never divisible by 9. So \( p=3 \) doesn't work.

Next prime: \( p=5 \).

Check if \( n^4 +1 \equiv 0 \mod 25 \).

First, let's see if \( n^4 \equiv -1 \mod 5 \). Then we might be able to lift it to modulo 25 using Hensel's lemma or something.

But wait, let's first check modulo 5.

Compute \( n^4 \mod5 \). By Fermat's little theorem, since 5 is prime, \( n^4 \equiv 1 \mod5 \) if \( n \) is not a multiple of 5. If \( n \) is a multiple of 5, \( n^4 \equiv 0 \mod5 \).

So \( n^4 +1 \equiv 1 +1=2 \mod5 \) if \( n \) not multiple of 5, and \( 0 +1=1 \mod5 \) if \( n \) is multiple of 5. Neither is 0 mod5. Therefore, \( n^4 +1 \) is never divisible by 5, so certainly not by 25. So \( p=5 \) is out.

Next prime: \( p=7 \).

Check if \( n^4 +1 \equiv 0 \mod49 \).

First, let's check modulo7.

Compute \( n^4 \mod7 \). The possible residues are:

0^4=0
1^4=1
2^4=16 mod7=2
3^4=81 mod7=81-11*7=81-77=4
4^4=(4^2)^2=16^2=256 mod7. 256/7=36*7=252, 256-252=4. So 4 mod7.
5^4=(-2)^4=16 mod7=2
6^4=(-1)^4=1 mod7.

So possible \( n^4 \) mod7: 0,1,2,4.

So \( n^4 +1 \) mod7: For n not divisible by 7, \( n^4+1 \) is 2, 3, or 5 mod7. If n is divisible by7, \( n^4+1 \equiv1 mod7 \). None are 0 mod7. Therefore, \( n^4 +1 \) is never divisible by7, so not by49. So \( p=7 \) doesn't work.

Next prime: \( p=11 \). Wait, maybe I should check 13 next?

Wait, perhaps I should consider primes where -1 is a quartic residue modulo p. Because if n^4 ≡ -1 mod p, then maybe we can lift it to mod p^2.

But wait, for n^4 ≡ -1 mod p, we need that -1 is a quartic residue mod p. So first, we need to know for which primes p, -1 is a quartic residue.

I remember that for primes p, the multiplicative group mod p is cyclic of order p-1. So the equation x^4 ≡ -1 mod p has a solution only if the order of -1 divides (p-1)/2, since -1 has order 2. Wait, maybe more precisely, the equation x^4 = -1 has solutions if the multiplicative order of -1 divides (p-1)/gcd(4, p-1). Hmm, perhaps another approach.

Alternatively, since x^8 ≡1 mod p, if x^4 ≡ -1, then x^8 ≡1. So the order of x must divide 8 but not 4, so it must be 8. Hence, 8 divides the order of the multiplicative group, which is p-1. So 8 divides p-1, i.e., p ≡1 mod8.

Wait, but wait, I'm not sure if that's correct. Let me think again.

If -1 is a quartic residue, then there exists some x such that x^4 ≡ -1 mod p. Then, x^8 ≡1 mod p. So the order of x divides 8 but doesn't divide 4, so the order is 8, which implies that 8 divides the order of the multiplicative group, which is p-1. So 8 divides p-1, so p ≡1 mod8.

Therefore, primes p ≡1 mod8 will have -1 as a quartic residue, meaning that there's some n with n^4 ≡-1 mod p. So for those primes, there's a chance that we can find n with n^4 +1 ≡0 mod p^2.

But wait, let's check for primes p ≡1 mod8. The primes after 2,3,5,7: the next primes are 11,13,17,19,23,29, etc.

Looking at primes ≡1 mod8:

17 is 1 mod8 (16 is 0 mod8, so 17 is 1 mod8).

Similarly, 97 is 1 mod8, etc.

Wait, so maybe the first prime where -1 is a quartic residue is 17. Hmm.

Wait, but perhaps for some smaller primes, even if p ≡ something else mod8, maybe n^4 ≡-1 mod p^2 is possible without n^4 ≡-1 mod p. Hmm, no, because if n^4 ≡-1 mod p^2, then certainly n^4 ≡-1 mod p. So if there's no solution mod p, then there's no solution mod p^2. So the first prime where n^4 +1 ≡0 mod p has solutions is when p ≡1 mod8.

So the first such prime is 17. So perhaps p=17.

Wait, but let's check for p=13. Because 13 is 5 mod8, which doesn't fit the earlier condition. But maybe there's another way.

Wait, perhaps I should check whether for p=17, whether n^4 +1 is divisible by 17^2=289.

But before jumping to that, let me check p=13 first, just to make sure.

Wait, let's think about p=13.

Compute n^4 mod13. Let's compute n^4 mod13 for n=1 to 12.

n=1: 1 mod13
n=2: 16 mod13=3
n=3: 81 mod13=3 (since 13*6=78, 81-78=3)
n=4: (4^2)^2=16^2=256 mod13. 13*19=247, 256-247=9.
n=5: 5^4=625. 13*48=624, 625-624=1. So 1 mod13.
n=6: 6^4=1296. Let's compute 1296 mod13. 13*99=1287, 1296-1287=9. So 9 mod13.
n=7: (-6)^4=6^4=9 mod13.
n=8: (-5)^4=5^4=1 mod13.
n=9: (-4)^4=4^4=9 mod13.
n=10: (-3)^4=3^4=3 mod13.
n=11: (-2)^4=2^4=3 mod13.
n=1
