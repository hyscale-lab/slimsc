Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the number of triples of nonnegative integers (a, b, c) such that a + b + c = 300 and another equation involving a²b + a²c + b²a + b²c + c²a + c²b equals 6,000,000. Hmm, that's quite a mouthful. Let me try to break it down.

First, the problem is about finding triples (a, b, c) where they are nonnegative integers. So, they can be zero or positive integers. The first condition is straightforward: a + b + c = 300. The second condition is a bit more complicated: a²b + a²c + b²a + b²c + c²a + c²b = 6,000,000.

I think I should try to simplify the second equation or maybe express it in a different way so it's easier to handle. Let me see... The terms in the second equation are all products of one squared variable and another variable. So, for example, a²b is a squared times b. Hmm, perhaps I can factor some parts of this expression.

Wait, if I factor it differently, perhaps I can factor out common terms. Let me try:

a²b + a²c = a²(b + c)
Similarly, b²a + b²c = b²(a + c)
And c²a + c²b = c²(a + b)

So, the entire expression becomes:
a²(b + c) + b²(a + c) + c²(a + b) = 6,000,000.

But I also know from the first equation that a + b + c = 300. So, if I subtract a from both sides, I get b + c = 300 - a. Similarly, a + c = 300 - b and a + b = 300 - c.

So substituting these into the expression, I have:

a²(300 - a) + b²(300 - b) + c²(300 - c) = 6,000,000.

That's an interesting form. So, let me write that out:

300a² - a³ + 300b² - b³ + 300c² - c³ = 6,000,000.

Hmm, maybe I can factor the 300:

300(a² + b² + c²) - (a³ + b³ + c³) = 6,000,000.

So, 300(a² + b² + c²) - (a³ + b³ + c³) = 6,000,000.

I wonder if I can express this in terms of symmetric sums or something. Alternatively, maybe I can relate this to the sum a + b + c, which is 300, and other symmetric sums like ab + bc + ca or abc.

I recall that there are formulas that relate sums of powers to symmetric sums. For example, a³ + b³ + c³ can be written in terms of a + b + c, ab + bc + ca, and abc.

Let me try to recall that formula. I think it's:

a³ + b³ + c³ = (a + b + c)^3 - 3(a + b + c)(ab + bc + ca) + 3abc.

Yes, that sounds right. So, let's denote S = a + b + c = 300, P = ab + bc + ca, and Q = abc.

Then, a³ + b³ + c³ = S³ - 3S P + 3Q.

So, plugging that into the equation:

300(a² + b² + c²) - [S³ - 3S P + 3Q] = 6,000,000.

But I also need an expression for a² + b² + c². I know that a² + b² + c² = S² - 2P.

Yes, because (a + b + c)^2 = a² + b² + c² + 2(ab + bc + ca), so a² + b² + c² = S² - 2P.

So, substituting that in:

300(S² - 2P) - [S³ - 3S P + 3Q] = 6,000,000.

Now, let's plug in S = 300:

300*(300² - 2P) - [300³ - 3*300*P + 3Q] = 6,000,000.

Let me compute each term step by step.

First, 300² is 90,000. So, 300*(90,000 - 2P) = 300*90,000 - 300*2P = 27,000,000 - 600P.

Next, the second part: 300³ is 27,000,000. Then, 3*300*P is 900P. So, the expression inside the brackets is 27,000,000 - 900P + 3Q.

Wait, no. Wait, the expression is [S³ - 3S P + 3Q] which is [27,000,000 - 900P + 3Q].

So putting it all together:

27,000,000 - 600P - (27,000,000 - 900P + 3Q) = 6,000,000.

Let me compute this:

27,000,000 - 600P -27,000,000 + 900P -3Q = 6,00
