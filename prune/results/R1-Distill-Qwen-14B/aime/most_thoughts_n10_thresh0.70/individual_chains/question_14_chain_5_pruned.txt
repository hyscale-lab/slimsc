Okay, let's try to figure out this problem step by step. So, the problem is about finding the greatest four-digit number N such that if you change any one of its digits to 1, the resulting number is divisible by 7. Then, we need to find Q + R where Q is the quotient and R is the remainder when N is divided by 1000.

First, let's parse the problem. We're looking for a four-digit number N. Let's denote its digits as a, b, c, d, where a is the thousands digit, b is the hundreds, c is the tens, and d is the ones digit. So, N = 1000a + 100b + 10c + d.

The key property here is that if we change any one digit to 1, the resulting number is divisible by 7. So, for each digit position (thousands, hundreds, tens, ones), replacing that digit with 1 should make the number divisible by 7.

Our goal is to find the largest such N. So, we want the maximum possible N that satisfies this condition.

Let me think about how each digit being changed to 1 affects divisibility by 7. For each digit, changing it to 1 should result in a number divisible by 7. So, for each position, there's a condition that the number with that digit replaced by 1 is a multiple of 7.

Let me break it down for each digit:

1. Changing the thousands digit to 1: The number becomes 1bcd. So, 1000 + 100b + 10c + d must be divisible by 7.
2. Changing the hundreds digit to 1: The number becomes a1cd. So, 1000a + 100 + 10c + d must be divisible by 7.
3. Changing the tens digit to 1: The number becomes ab1d. So, 1000a + 100b + 10 + d must be divisible by 7.
4. Changing the ones digit to 1: The number becomes abc1. So, 1000a + 100b + 10c + 1 must be divisible by 7.

So, we have four conditions here. Let me write them mathematically:

1. 1000 + 100b + 10c + d ≡ 0 mod 7
2. 1000a + 100 + 10c + d ≡ 0 mod 7
3. 1000a + 100b + 10 + d ≡ 0 mod 7
4. 1000a + 100b + 10c + 1 ≡ 0 mod 7

Our N is 1000a + 100b + 10c + d, and we want the largest possible N, so we should try to maximize a, then b, then c, then d.

Since we're dealing with mod 7, perhaps I can compute what each of these numbers is modulo 7.

Let me compute 1000 mod 7, 100 mod 7, 10 mod 7, and 1 mod 7.

Calculating:

1000 ÷ 7: 7*142=994, so 1000 ≡ 6 mod 7.

100 ÷ 7: 7*14=98, so 100 ≡ 2 mod 7.

10 ÷ 7: 10 ≡3 mod 7.

1 is obviously 1 mod 7.

So, now, let me rewrite each condition using these mod 7 equivalents.

1. 1000 + 100b + 10c + d ≡ 0 mod7
   6 + 2b + 3c + d ≡0 mod7

2. 1000a + 100 + 10c + d ≡0 mod7
   (6a) + 2 + 3c + d ≡0 mod7

3. 1000a + 100b + 10 + d ≡0 mod7
   6a + 2b + 3 + d ≡0 mod7

4. 1000a + 100b + 10c + 1 ≡0 mod7
   6a + 2b + 3c + 1 ≡0 mod7

So, now, we have four equations mod7:

1. 2b + 3c + d ≡ -6 mod7 → 2b +3c +d ≡1 mod7 (since -6 ≡1 mod7)
2. 6a + 3c + d ≡ -2 mod7 → 6a +3c +d ≡5 mod7
3. 6a + 2b + d ≡ -3 mod7 → 6a +2b +d ≡4 mod7
4. 6a + 2b + 3c ≡ -1 mod7 → 6a +2b +3c ≡6 mod7

Hmm, okay, that's four equations.

So, we have:

Equation (1): 2b +3c +d ≡1 mod7

Equation (2):6a +3c +d ≡5 mod7

Equation (3):6a +2b +d ≡4 mod7

Equation (4):6a +2b +3c ≡6 mod7

We can try to solve these equations step by step.

Let me note that N is the four-digit number, so a is from 1 to 9, and b, c, d are from 0 to 9.

Our aim is to find the largest N, so we should try a=9 first, then a=8, etc., until we find a solution.

Let me try a=9.

So, a=9.

Compute 6a mod7: 6*9=54; 54 mod7: 54 ÷7 is 7*7=49, 54-49=5. So, 6a ≡5 mod7.

Now, let's substitute a=9 into equations (2), (3), and (4):

Equation (2): 5 +3c +d ≡5 mod7 → So, 3c +d ≡0 mod7.

Equation (3):5 +2b +d ≡4 mod7 → 2b +d ≡-1 mod7 → 2b +d ≡6 mod7.

Equation (4):5 +2b +3c ≡6 mod7 → 2b +3c ≡1 mod7.

So, now, with a=9, we have:

Equation (1):2b +3c +d ≡1 mod7

Equation (2):3c +d ≡0 mod7

Equation (3):2b +d ≡6 mod7

Equation (4):2b +3c ≡1 mod7

Let me see if I can express d from equation (2):

From equation (2): d ≡ -3c mod7 → d ≡4c mod7 (since -3 ≡4 mod7).

Similarly, from equation (3): 2b +d ≡6 mod7.

But from equation (2), d ≡4c, so substitute into equation (3):

2b +4c ≡6 mod7 → Let's write that as equation (3'):

2b +4c ≡6 mod7.

From equation (4): 2b +3c ≡1 mod7.

So, equation (4) is 2b +3c ≡1 mod7.

Let me subtract equation (4) from equation (3'):

(2b +4c) - (2b +3c) ≡6 -1 mod7 → c ≡5 mod7.

So, c ≡5 mod7. Since c is a digit (0-9), possible c values are 5 and 12, but 12 is invalid, so c=5.

So, c=5.

Now, from equation (4):2b +3*5 ≡1 mod7 → 2b +15 ≡1 mod7.

15 mod7 is 1, so 2b +1 ≡1 mod7 → 2b ≡0 mod7.

So, 2b ≡0 mod7 → b ≡0 mod7 (since 2 and 7 are coprime, so b must be 0 mod7).

Since b is a digit (0-9), possible b=0 or 7.

But we are trying to find the largest N, so we want the largest possible digits. So, a=9, so next is b as large as possible.

If b=7, that's better than b=0. So, let's try b=7.

So, b=7.

Now, from equation (2):3c +d ≡0 mod7.

We have c=5, so 3*5 +d ≡0 mod7 →15 +d ≡0 mod7.

15 mod7 is 1, so 1 +d ≡0 mod7 →d ≡-1 mod7 →d≡6 mod7.

Since d is a digit (0-9), d can be 6 or 13, but 13 is invalid. So, d=6.

So, d=6.

Now, let's check equation (1):2b +3c +d ≡1 mod7.

Plug in b=7, c=5, d=6:

2*7=14, 3*5=15, 14+15=29, 29+6=35. 35 mod7 is 0, which should be ≡1 mod7? That's not correct.

Wait, 35 mod7 is 0, which is not equal to 1 mod7. Hmm, that's a problem.

So, this suggests a contradiction. So, our assumption that a=9, b=7, c=5, d=6 might not satisfy equation (1).

Wait, but from equation (2), equation (3), and equation (4), we derived c=5, b=7, d=6.

But equation (1) is not satisfied. So, that's a problem.

So, perhaps, a=9 is not possible with b=7. Maybe we need to check b=0.

So, let's try b=0.

So, a=9, b=0, c=5, d=6.

Check equation (1):2*0 +3*5 +6 =0 +15 +6=21. 21 mod7 is 0, which should be ≡1 mod7. Again, not satisfied.

Hmm, so that's an issue. So, maybe a=9 is not possible.

Wait, but perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let me double-check.

From equation (4):2b +3c
