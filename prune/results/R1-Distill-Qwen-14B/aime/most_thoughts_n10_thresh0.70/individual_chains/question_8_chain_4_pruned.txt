Okay, so I've got this problem here that asks for the number of triples of nonnegative integers (a, b, c) such that a + b + c = 300 and a²b + a²c + b²a + b²c + c²a + c²b = 6,000,000. Hmm, that looks a bit complex, but maybe I can break it down.

First, I remember that when dealing with equations involving sums of variables with certain constraints, sometimes symmetric expressions can be helpful. The given expression a²b + a²c + b²a + b²c + c²a + c²b seems symmetric in a, b, c. Maybe I can factor it or find a way to relate it to the sum a + b + c.

Let me write down the given equations:

1. a + b + c = 300
2. a²b + a²c + b²a + b²c + c²a + c²b = 6,000,000

I notice that the second equation can be rewritten by factoring. Let me try that. Looking at each term, I see that each term is of the form x²y, where x and y are different variables. So, for example, a²b and a²c are terms with a squared multiplied by b and c respectively. Similarly for the others.

Alternatively, maybe I can factor this expression. Let me see:

a²b + a²c = a²(b + c)
Similarly, b²a + b²c = b²(a + c)
And c²a + c²b = c²(a + b)

So, the entire expression can be written as:

a²(b + c) + b²(a + c) + c²(a + b)

Hmm, that's a bit more manageable. Now, since a + b + c = 300, maybe I can substitute (b + c) with (300 - a), and similarly for the others.

Let's try that:

a²(b + c) = a²(300 - a)
b²(a + c) = b²(300 - b)
c²(a + b) = c²(300 - c)

So, the second equation becomes:

a²(300 - a) + b²(300 - b) + c²(300 - c) = 6,000,000

Expanding each term:

300a² - a³ + 300b² - b³ + 300c² - c³ = 6,000,000

Hmm, can I factor this expression further? Let me group the terms:

300(a² + b² + c²) - (a³ + b³ + c³) = 6,000,000

Divide both sides by 300 to simplify:

(a² + b² + c²) - (1/300)(a³ + b³ + c³) = 20,000

Wait, that seems a bit messy. Maybe another approach is needed.

I recall that for three variables a, b, c, there are some symmetric identities. Specifically, the sum a³ + b³ + c³ can be expressed in terms of the sums a + b + c, ab + bc + ca, and abc. But I'm not sure if that helps here.

Alternatively, perhaps I can express a² + b² + c² in terms of (a + b + c)² and ab + bc + ca.

Yes, the identity is:

a² + b² + c² = (a + b + c)² - 2(ab + bc + ca)

So, since a + b + c = 300, we can write:

a² + b² + c² = 300² - 2(ab + bc + ca) = 90,000 - 2(ab + bc + ca)

Let me substitute this into the equation I had earlier:

300(a² + b² + c²) - (a³ + b³ + c³) = 6,000,000

Which becomes:

300[90,000 - 2(ab + bc + ca)] - (a³ + b³ + c³) = 6,000,000

Compute 300*90,000:

300 * 90,000 = 27,000,000

So, the equation becomes:

27,000,000 - 600(ab + bc + ca) - (a³ + b³ + c³) = 6,000,000

Subtract 6,000,000 from both sides:

21,000,000 - 600(ab + bc + ca) - (a³ + b³ + c³) = 0

Rearranged:

a³ + b³ + c³ + 600(ab + bc + ca) = 21,000,000

Hmm, not sure if that helps. Maybe I can relate a³ + b³ + c³ to something else.

Wait, another identity: a³ + b³ + c³ - 3abc = (a
