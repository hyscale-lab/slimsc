Alright, so I've got this math problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again and try to understand what's being asked.

The problem says: Let $N$ be the greatest four-digit positive integer with the property that whenever one of its digits is changed to $1$, the resulting number is divisible by $7$. Then, when we divide $N$ by $1000$, we get a quotient $Q$ and a remainder $R$. We need to find $Q + R$.

Hmm, okay. So, first, I need to find the largest four-digit number $N$ such that if any one of its digits is replaced by $1$, the new number is divisible by 7. Then, once I have $N$, I divide it by 1000 and add the quotient and remainder.

Let me break this down. So, $N$ is a four-digit number, which means it's between 1000 and 9999. I need to find the largest such $N$ with the given property. Then, $N = 1000Q + R$, so $Q$ is the thousands digit, and $R$ is the last three digits. So, for example, if $N$ were 5678, then $Q$ would be 5 and $R$ would be 678, so $Q + R = 5 + 678 = 683$.

But before that, I need to find $N$. Let's focus on that.

The key property here is that changing any single digit of $N$ to $1$ results in a number divisible by 7. So, for each digit in $N$, if I replace it with 1, the number becomes a multiple of 7.

Let me denote the four-digit number as $N = \overline{abcd}$, where $a$, $b$, $c$, and $d$ are its digits, with $a$ not zero (since it's a four-digit number). So, $N = 1000a + 100b + 10c + d$.

Now, the property tells me that replacing any one digit with 1 gives a multiple of 7. So, replacing $a$ with 1 gives us a number $1000*1 + 100b + 10c + d = 100b + 10c + d + 1000$, which must be divisible by 7. Similarly, replacing $b$, $c$, or $d$ with 1 gives numbers that are divisible by 7.

So, for each digit position, changing that digit to 1 and keeping the others the same gives a multiple of 7.

Let me think about how to model this. Let's define four numbers:

- $N_a = 1000*1 + 100b + 10c + d$
- $N_b = 1000a + 100*1 + 10c + d$
- $N_c = 1000a + 100b + 10*1 + d$
- $N_d = 1000a + 100b + 10c + 1$

Each of these $N_a$, $N_b$, $N_c$, $N_d$ must be divisible by 7.

So, $N_a \equiv 0 \mod 7$, $N_b \equiv 0 \mod 7$, $N_c \equiv 0 \mod 7$, $N_d \equiv 0 \mod 7$.

But $N$ itself is the original number, not necessarily divisible by 7. Wait, but wait, when we change each digit, the number becomes divisible by 7. So, the original number $N$ might not be divisible by 7, but all these modified versions are.

So, I can write four congruences:

1. $N_a = 1000 + 100b + 10c + d \equiv 0 \mod 7$
2. $N_b = 1000a + 100 + 10c + d \equiv 0 \mod 7$
3. $N_c = 1000a + 100b + 10 + d \equiv 0 \mod 7$
4. $N_d = 1000a + 100b + 10c + 1 \equiv 0 \mod 7$

But since $N = 1000a + 100b + 10c + d$, let's express each of these in terms of $N$.

Let me think about each case:

1. $N_a = 1000 + 100b + 10c + d = (1000a + 100b + 10c + d) - (1000a - 1000) = N - 1000a + 1000$

Wait, that's probably not the easiest way. Alternatively, since $N = 1000a + 100b + 10c + d$, then:

$N_a = 1000 + 100b + 10c + d = 1000 + (N - 1000a)$

Similarly, $N_b = 100 + 10c + d + 1000a = 100 + (N - 1000a - 100b)$

Wait, maybe another approach: Let's write each modified number in terms of $N$.

Alternatively, notice that each modified number is $N$ with one digit replaced by 1. So for each digit position, the modified number differs from $N$ by the difference caused by replacing that digit.

Let me see. For the thousands digit, replacing $a$ with 1 gives $N_a = 1000 + 100b + 10c + d$, whereas $N = 1000a + 100b + 10c + d$. So the difference is $N_a - N = 1000 - 1000a = 1000(1 - a)$.

Similarly, for the hundreds digit, $N_b - N = 100(1 - b)$.

For the tens digit, $N_c - N = 10(1 - c)$.

For the units digit, $N_d - N = 1 - d$.

Now, since each modified number is divisible by 7, we have:

1. $N_a \equiv 0 \mod 7$ → $N + 1000(1 - a) \equiv 0 \mod 7$ → $N \equiv -1000(1 - a) \mod 7$
2. $N_b \equiv 0 \mod 7$ → $N + 100(1 - b) \equiv 0 \mod 7$ → $N \equiv -100(1 - b) \mod 7$
3. $N_c \equiv 0 \mod 7$ → $N + 10(1 - c) \equiv 0 \mod 7$ → $N \equiv -10(1 - c) \mod 7$
4. $N_d \equiv 0 \mod 7$ → $N + (1 - d) \equiv 0 \mod 7$ → $N \equiv -(1 - d) \mod 7$

So, each of these gives a congruence for $N$ modulo 7. Therefore, all four expressions must be congruent to $N$ modulo 7. So, we can set up equations:

1. $N \equiv -1000(1 - a) \mod 7$
2. $N \equiv -100(1 - b) \mod 7$
3. $N \equiv -10(1 - c) \mod 7$
4. $N \equiv -(1 - d) \mod 7$

These four expressions must all be equal to each other modulo 7. So:

- $-1000(1 - a) \equiv -100(1 - b) \mod 7$
- $-100(1 - b) \equiv -10(1 - c) \mod 7$
- $-10(1 - c) \equiv -(1 - d) \mod 7$

Let me simplify each of these congruences.

First, let's compute the coefficients modulo 7 because 1000, 100, 10, and 1 modulo 7 can be simplified.

Calculate 1000 mod 7:

7 × 142 = 994 → 1000 - 994 = 6 → 1000 ≡ 6 mod 7.

Similarly,

100 ÷ 7: 7×14=98 → 100 -98 =2 → 100 ≡ 2 mod7.

10 ÷7: 10-7=3 → 10 ≡3 mod7.

1 ≡1 mod7.

So, substituting:

1. $N ≡ -6(1 - a) mod7$.

2. $N ≡ -2(1 - b) mod7$.

3. $N ≡ -3(1 - c) mod7$.

4. $N ≡ -(1 - d) mod7$.

So, equations become:

1. $N ≡ 6(a - 1) mod7$.

2. $N ≡ 2(b - 1) mod7$.

3. $N ≡ 3(c - 1) mod7$.

4. $N ≡ (d - 1) mod7$.

Now, since all four congruences must be equal (they are all equal to N mod7), we can set them equal to each other:

6(a - 1) ≡ 2(b - 1) ≡ 3(c - 1) ≡ (d - 1) mod7.

So, all these expressions are congruent modulo7. Let me denote this common value as k, so:

k ≡ 6(a - 1) mod7,

k ≡ 2(b - 1) mod7,

k ≡ 3(c - 1) mod7,

k ≡ (d - 1) mod7.

So, all these expressions equal the same k modulo7.

Therefore, I can write:

6(a - 1) ≡ 2(b - 1) mod7,

2(b - 1) ≡ 3(c - 1) mod7,

3(c - 1) ≡ (d - 1) mod7.

Let me handle each pair of congruences.

First: 6(a - 1) ≡ 2(b - 1) mod7.

We can write this as:

6(a - 1) - 2(b - 1) ≡0 mod7.

Factor:

6(a - 1) - 2(b -1) = 6a -6 -2b +2 =6a -2b -4.

So, 6a -2b -4 ≡0 mod7.

Let me factor this:

Divide all terms by 2: 3a - b -2 ≡0 mod7/ gcd(2,7)=1. So, 3a - b -2 ≡0 mod7.

So, 3a - b ≡2 mod7.

Similarly, second congruence: 2(b -1) ≡3(c -1) mod7.

So, 2b -2 ≡3c -3 mod7.

Bring all to left: 2b -2 -3c +3 ≡0 → 2b -3c +1 ≡0 mod7.

Third congruence: 3(c -1) ≡ (d -1) mod7.

So, 3c -3 ≡d -1 mod7 → 3c -d -2 ≡0 mod7.

So, now we have three equations:

1. 3a - b ≡2 mod7. (Equation 1)

2. 2b -3c ≡ -1 mod7 → 2b -3c ≡6 mod7. (Equation 2)

3. 3c - d ≡2 mod7. (Equation 3)

So, now we have these three equations in variables a, b, c, d.

Remember that a, b, c, d are digits (0-9), and a is from 1-9.

We need to find digits a,b,c,d such that these equations hold, and N=abcd is the largest possible four-digit number.

Since we need the largest N, we should start with the largest possible a (which is 9), then try to maximize b, c, d as much as possible, but subject to the constraints.

So, let's start by assuming a=9, and see what that implies.

If a=9:

From Equation 1: 3(9) - b ≡2 mod7 → 27 - b ≡2 mod7.

Compute 27 mod7: 7×3=21, 27-21=6 → 27≡6 mod7.

So, 6 - b ≡2 mod7 → -b ≡2 -6 mod7 → -b ≡-4 mod7 → Multiply both sides by -1: b ≡4 mod7.

Since b is a digit (0-9), possible values of b are 4 and 11, but 11 is invalid, so b=4.

So, b=4.

Now, from Equation 2: 2b -3c ≡6 mod7. Since b=4:

2*4 -3c ≡6 mod7 →8 -3c ≡6 mod7 →8-6 ≡3c mod7 →2 ≡3c mod7.

We need to solve 3c ≡2 mod7.

Multiplicative inverse of 3 mod7 is 5, because 3×5=15≡1 mod7.

Multiply both sides by 5: c ≡2×5=10≡3 mod7.

So, c=3 or 10, but since c is a digit, c=3.

Now, from Equation 3: 3c -d ≡2 mod7.

With c=3: 3*3 -d ≡2 →9 -d ≡2 mod7.

9 mod7 is 2, so 2 -d ≡2 mod7 → -d ≡0 mod7 → d≡0 mod7.

So, d=0 or 7.

Since we're trying to maximize N, we should choose the larger possible d, which is 7.

So, d=7.

So, putting it all together, when a=9, we get b=4, c=3, d=7.

So, the number N=9437.

Wait, let's check if this satisfies all the original conditions.

So, N=9437.

Now, let's replace each digit with 1 and check divisibility by 7:

1. Replace thousands digit (9) with 1: 1437.

Check if 1437 is divisible by 7.

1437 ÷7: Let's see, 7×205=1435, 1437-1435=2. So, 1437=7×205 +2 → not divisible by 7. Hmm, that's a problem.

Wait, that can't be. So, according to our earlier equations, it should satisfy, but in reality, it's not. Did I make a mistake in the calculations?

Wait, let me check the calculations again.

Starting with a=9.

Equation 1: 3a -b ≡2 mod7 →3*9=27≡6 mod7. So, 6 -b ≡2 mod7 → -b ≡2-6= -4 mod7 →b≡4 mod7. So, b=4 is correct.

Equation 2: 2b -3c ≡6 mod7 →2*4=8≡1 mod7 →1 -3c ≡6 mod7 →-3c ≡5 mod7 →3c≡-5≡2 mod7. So, 3c≡2 mod7. As before, c=3 because 3×3=9≡2 mod7? Wait, 9 mod7 is 2, yes. So, c
