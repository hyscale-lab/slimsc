Okay, so I have this problem about counting paths on an 8x8 grid. The paths start at the lower left corner and end at the upper right corner, and they have a length of 16. I need to find the number of such paths that change direction exactly four times.

Hmm, let me think. First, I should understand what the grid looks like. An 8x8 grid means there are 8 rows and 8 columns, right? So moving from the lower left to the upper right would require moving 7 steps up and 7 steps to the right, totaling 14 steps. Wait, but the problem says the path length is 16. That seems confusing because 8x8 grid would have 7 steps in each direction. Maybe the grid is 8 squares in each direction, so steps would be 8? No, wait, no, a grid with 8 rows has 7 lines between them, so steps would be 7. Hmm, maybe I'm misunderstanding the grid dimensions.

Wait, perhaps the grid is 8x8 squares, meaning it's 9x9 points? Because in grids, the number of points is one more than the number of squares. So, an 8x8 grid has 9 points along each side. So moving from the lower left to the upper right would require 8 steps right and 8 steps up, totaling 16 steps. Oh, that makes sense. So the path length is 16, which is correct.

So, any path from the start to the end on this grid is a sequence of right and up moves, 8 of each. The total number of such paths without any restrictions is the combination of 16 moves taken 8 at a time, which is C(16,8). But the problem isn't just about any path; it's about paths that change direction exactly four times.

Changing direction exactly four times. So, what does that mean? Each time the path changes direction, it switches from moving right to up or from up to right. So, if a path starts by moving right, the first direction change would be when it switches to up, and so on.

Wait, so each direction change is a switch from right to up or up to right. So, if a path has exactly four direction changes, how does that translate into the number of runs of consecutive right or up moves?

Right, a run is a consecutive sequence of the same move. So, if a path changes direction four times, that means it has five runs. For example, starting with a run of rights, then up, then right, then up, etc., totaling five runs for four direction changes.

But wait, the starting direction could be either right or up. So, does that affect the count? Let me think.

If the path starts with a right move, then the first run is right, then up, then right, etc. Similarly, if it starts with an up move, the runs alternate from up to right and so on. But since the path must end at the upper right corner, which requires 8 rights and 8 ups, the number of runs in each direction must be such that the total steps add up.

Wait, so if a path has five runs, and
