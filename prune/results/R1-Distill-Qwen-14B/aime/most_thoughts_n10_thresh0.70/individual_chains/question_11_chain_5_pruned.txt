Okay, so I need to find the largest possible real part of this complex expression: (75 + 117i)z + (96 + 144i)/z, where z is a complex number with |z| = 4. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.

First, since |z| = 4, I know that z can be written in polar form as z = 4e^{iθ}, where θ is the argument of z. That might make things easier because working with exponentials can sometimes simplify multiplication and division.

So, let me represent z as 4e^{iθ}. Then, 1/z would be (1/4)e^{-iθ} because the magnitude of 1/z is 1/|z|, which is 1/4, and the angle is -θ.

Now, let's substitute these into the expression. The first term becomes (75 + 117i) * 4e^{iθ}. Let me calculate that:

(75 + 117i) * 4 = 75*4 + 117*4i = 300 + 468i. So that term is (300 + 468i)e^{iθ}.

The second term is (96 + 144i) * (1/4)e^{-iθ}. Let me compute (96 + 144i)/4: 96/4 = 24, 144/4 = 36, so that becomes (24 + 36i)e^{-iθ}.

So now, the entire expression is (300 + 468i)e^{iθ} + (24 + 36i)e^{-iθ}.

Now, to find the real part of this expression, I can compute the sum and then take the real part. Let me denote the two complex numbers as A = (300 + 468i) and B = (24 + 36i). So the expression is A e^{iθ} + B e^{-iθ}.

The real part of this is Re(A e^{iθ}) + Re(B e^{-iθ}). I can compute each Re separately.

Recall that Re(C e^{iφ}) = |C| cos(φ + φ_C), where φ_C is the argument of C. Alternatively, I can write C e^{iφ} as |C| e^{i(φ + φ_C)}, so the real part is |C| cos(φ + φ_C).

Alternatively, another approach is to write A e^{iθ} as |A| e^{i(θ + α)}, where α is the argument of A, so its real part is |A| cos(θ + α). Similarly for B e^{-iθ}.

Let me compute |A| and |B|:

|A| = sqrt(300² + 468²). Let me calculate that:

300² = 90000, 468² = 468*468. Hmm, 400² is 160000, 68² is 4624, and then 2*400*68 = 54400. So 468² = (400 + 68)^2 = 400² + 2*400*68 + 68² = 160000 + 54400 + 4624 = 219024. So |A| = sqrt(90000 + 219024) = sqrt(309024). Let me see, 556² is 309136 because 550²=302500, 555²=308025, 556²=555² + 2*555 +1=308025 + 1110 +1=309136. But 309024 is less than that. Let me compute sqrt(309024):

Let me see, 556² is 309136, which is 112 more than 309024, so sqrt(309024) is 556 - some small number. Alternatively, perhaps 556 - 112/(2*556) ≈ 556 - 0.1 ≈ 555.9, but maybe exact value isn't necessary right now. Let's just keep it as sqrt(309024) for now.

Similarly, |B| = sqrt(24² + 36²) = sqrt(576 + 1296) = sqrt(1872). Hmm, 1872 is 16*117, which is 16*(9*13) = 16*9*13. So sqrt(1872) = 4*3*sqrt(13) = 12√13 ≈ 12*3.605551275 ≈ 43.2666153.

Wait, maybe I should compute the arguments as well. Let me find α, the argument of A, and β, the argument of B.

For A = 300 + 468i: the argument α is arctan(468/300) = arctan(1.56). Let me see, tan(57 degrees) is about 1.5399, and tan(57.5) is about 1.6003. So 1.56 is between 57 and 57.5. Maybe approximately 57.2 degrees or something. Let me compute it more accurately.

But perhaps it's better to keep it as arctan(468/300). Let me compute 468/300 = 1.56. So α = arctan(1.56). Similarly, for B = 24 + 36i, β = arctan(36/24) = arctan(1.5). Which is 56.31 degrees approximately, since tan(56.31) ≈ 1.5.

Wait, wait, 36/24 is 1.5, so yes, arctan(1.5). So β = arctan(1.5).

Wait, but when we have Re(A e^{iθ}) = |A| cos(θ + α), and Re(B e^{-iθ}) = |B| cos(-θ + β) because B e^{-iθ} has the angle -θ + β. So cos(-θ + β) is the same as cos(θ - β) because cosine is even.

Therefore, the real part is |A| cos(θ + α) + |B| cos(θ - β).

Hmm, so combining these terms, I can write this as:

Re = |A| cos(θ + α) + |B| cos(θ - β).

I need to find the maximum value of Re with respect to θ.

This is a function of θ, which is a real number. To find the maximum real part, I can treat this as a function of θ and find its maximum.

Let me denote this function as f(θ) =
