Okay, so I've got this problem here where I need to figure out how many ways there are to fill a 2x3 grid with digits. The conditions are that when you read the numbers left to right, the two numbers add up to 999, and when you read them top to bottom, the three numbers add up to 99. Hmm, that sounds a bit tricky, but let me try to break it down.

First, let me visualize the grid. It's a 2x3 grid, so there are two rows and three columns. Let me represent this grid with variables. I'll label the top row as A, B, C and the bottom row as D, E, F. So the grid looks like this:

A | B | C
-----
D | E | F

Now, when reading left to right, the top row forms a three-digit number, which is ABC, and the bottom row forms another three-digit number, DEF. The problem states that ABC + DEF = 999. 

On the other hand, when reading top to bottom, each column forms a two-digit number. So the first column is AD, the second is BE, and the third is CF. The sum of these three two-digit numbers should be 99. So, AD + BE + CF = 99.

Alright, so I have two main equations here:

1. ABC + DEF = 999
2. AD + BE + CF = 99

I need to find the number of possible digit assignments to A, B, C, D, E, F that satisfy both equations.

Let me first express ABC and DEF numerically. ABC is 100*A + 10*B + C, and DEF is 100*D + 10*E + F. So adding them:

(100A + 10B + C) + (100D + 10E + F) = 999

Simplify that:

100A + 10B + C + 100D + 10E + F = 999

Similarly, for the column sums:

AD is 10*A + D,
BE is 10*B + E,
CF is 10*C + F.

Adding them gives:

(10A + D) + (10B + E) + (10C + F) = 99

Simplify that:

10A + D + 10B + E + 10C + F = 99

Let me write both equations again:

Equation 1: 100A + 10B + C + 100D + 10E + F = 999

Equation 2: 10A + D + 10B + E + 10C + F = 99

Hmm, I have these two equations. Maybe I can subtract equation 2 from equation 1 to eliminate some variables. Let me try that.

Equation 1 minus Equation 2:

(100A + 10B + C + 100D + 10E + F) - (10A + D + 10B + E + 10C + F) = 999 - 99

Let's compute each term:

100A -10A = 90A

10B -10B = 0

C -10C = -9C

100D - D = 99D

10E - E = 9E

F - F = 0

So putting it all together:

90A -9C + 99D + 9E = 900

I can factor out a 9:

9*(10A - C + 11D + E) = 900

Divide both sides by 9:

10A - C + 11D + E = 100

So now I have this equation: 10A - C + 11D + E = 100. Let me note this as equation 3.

Now, equation 2 is:

10A + D + 10B + E + 10C + F = 99

I can perhaps express F from equation 2 in terms of other variables.

Wait, equation 2: Let me rearrange it:

F = 99 - 10A - D - 10B - E - 10C

But F has to be a digit, so F is between 0 and 9, inclusive. So whatever the right side is, it has to result in F being an integer in that range.

But maybe instead of that, let me think about the relationships between the variables.

Looking back at equation 3: 10A - C + 11D + E = 100

Hmm, perhaps I can relate this to equation 2.

Alternatively, let me think about the variables. Since A, D are digits in the hundreds place of their respective numbers, ABC and DEF, which sum to 999. So ABC is at most 999, and DEF is at least 0.

Wait, but ABC and DEF are three-digit numbers. So A can't be zero. Similarly, D can't be zero because DEF is a three-digit number.

Wait, hold on. Wait, in the example given, the top row has 0,0,8. So actually, A can be zero. Hmm, because ABC is 008, which is 8, a single-digit number. Wait, but the problem says "the sum of the two numbers formed by reading left to right is 999". So ABC can be a one-digit number if A and B are zero, but DEF would then have to be 999. But wait, DEF is a three-digit number, so D can't be zero. So A can be zero, but D can't be zero.

Wait, but in the example, the top row is 0 0 8, making ABC = 008 = 8, and DEF is 991, so
