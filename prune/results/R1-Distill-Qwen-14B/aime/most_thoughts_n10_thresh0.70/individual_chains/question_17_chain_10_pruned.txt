Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we have a set of rectangular boxes, each with a surface area of 54 and a volume of 23. We need to find the radius of the smallest sphere that can contain any of these boxes, and then compute r², express it as a fraction p/q where p and q are coprime, and finally find p+q.

First, let me visualize the problem. A rectangular box has length, width, and height, say x, y, z. The surface area is 2(xy + yz + xz) = 54, and the volume is xyz = 23. We need to find the minimal sphere that can enclose such a box. The sphere's diameter will be the space diagonal of the box because the space diagonal is the longest distance in the box, so to fit the box inside the sphere, the sphere's diameter must be at least equal to the space diagonal.

So, the space diagonal of the box is sqrt(x² + y² + z²). Therefore, the radius r of the sphere must be half of that, so r = sqrt(x² + y² + z²)/2. Our goal is to minimize r, which is equivalent to minimizing x² + y² + z², given the constraints of surface area and volume.

So, we have two equations:
1. 2(xy + yz + xz) = 54 → xy + yz + xz = 27
2. xyz = 23

We need to minimize x² + y² + z².

Hmm, this seems like an optimization problem with constraints. I remember that in such cases, we can use methods like Lagrange multipliers, but since it's symmetric, perhaps we can assume some symmetry in the variables, like maybe x = y, to simplify things.

Wait, but if all variables were equal, it would be a cube, but in that case, the surface area and volume might not match. Let's check that. Suppose x = y = z. Then surface area would be 6x² = 54 → x²=9 → x=3. Volume would be 27, but we need volume 23, which is less. So, it's not a cube. Therefore, the minimal sphere might correspond to a box that's not a cube but maybe has two sides equal? Let's assume x = y, so that we can reduce the number of variables.

Let me proceed with the assumption that x = y. So, set x = y. Then, our constraints become:

From surface area: 2(x² + xz + xz) = 54 → 2x² + 4xz = 54 → x² + 2xz = 27.

From volume: x * x * z = 23 → x² z = 23 → z = 23/(x²).

Substitute z into the surface area equation:

x² + 2x*(23/x²) = 27 → x² + (46/x) = 27.

Multiply both sides by x to eliminate the denominator:

x³ + 46 = 27x → x³ -27x +46 = 0.

So, we have a cubic equation in x: x³ -27x +46 = 0.

Hmm, let me try to find the roots of this cubic. Maybe rational root theorem can help. The possible rational roots are factors of 46 over factors of 1, so possible roots: ±1, ±2, ±23, ±46.

Let me test them:

x=1: 1 -27 +46 = 20 ≠0.

x=2: 8 -54 +46 = 0 → yes, x=2 is a root.

So, we can factor this as (x - 2)(x² + 2x -23) =0.

Set to zero: x=2, or x² + 2x -23=0.

Solving x² + 2x -23=0: x = [-2 ± sqrt(4 +92)]/2 = [-2 ± sqrt(96)]/2 = [-2 ± 4*sqrt(6)]/2 = -1 ± 2*sqrt(6).

Since x must be positive, x= -1 + 2√6 ≈ -1 + 4.898 ≈ 3.898. But wait, let's see if x=2 is the only positive real root here.

Wait, the cubic x³ -27x +46 has two other real roots? Let me check: after factoring out (x-2), the quadratic is x² + 2x -23, which has two real roots as we saw. So, the three real roots are x=2, x= -1 + 2√6, and x= -1 -2√6. The last one is negative, so we can ignore it. Therefore, the possible x values are 2 and approximately 3.898.

Wait, but if x=2, then z=23/(x²)=23/4=5.75.

So, the box dimensions would be x=2, y=2, z=5.75.

But let's check if that satisfies the surface area:

2(xy + yz + xz) = 2*(4 + 11.5 + 11.5) = 2*(27) =54. Yes, that works.

Similarly, volume is 2*2*5.75=23. Correct.

Now, what is x² + y² + z² in this case? Since x=y=2, z=5.75.

So, 2² + 2² + (5.75)^2 = 4 +4 +33.0625 = 41.0625.

41.0625 is equal to 657/16 because 41*16=656, 0.0625*16=1, so 657/16.

So, x² + y² + z² = 657/16.

Wait, but is this the minimal value? Because we assumed x=y. Maybe the minimal occurs at some other point where x, y, z are all different. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the minimal x² + y² + z² occurs when variables are equal? But in our case, when x=y=z, we get surface area 54, volume 27, but we need volume 23, which is less. So, the minimal might not correspond to the symmetric case.

Alternatively, perhaps the minimal occurs when two variables are equal, but we have to check if x=2, y=2, z=23/4 gives the minimal sum.

Alternatively, perhaps we can approach this using the method of Lagrange multipliers without assuming any symmetry.

So, variables x, y, z >0.

We want to minimize f(x, y, z) = x² + y² + z².

Subject to constraints:

g(x, y, z) = 2(xy + yz + xz) -54 =0,

h(x, y, z) = xyz -23 =0.

Set up the Lagrangian: L = x² + y² + z² - λ(2xy + 2yz + 2xz -54) - μ(xyz -23).

Take partial derivatives:

∂L/∂x = 2x - λ(2y + 2z) - μ(yz) =0,

∂L/∂y = 2y - λ(2x + 2z) - μ(xz) =0,

∂L/∂z = 2z - λ(2x + 2y) - μ(xy)=0,

And constraints:

2(xy + yz + xz)=54,

xyz=23.

So, we have the system of equations:

1. 2x = λ(2y + 2z) + μ(yz),

2. 2y = λ(2x + 2z) + μ(xz),

3. 2z = λ(2x + 2y) + μ(xy),

4. 2(xy + yz + xz)=54,

5. xyz=23.

This seems a bit complicated, but perhaps we can find ratios between the variables.

Let me consider equations 1 and 2.

From equations 1 and 2:

2x = λ(2y + 2z) + μ(yz),

2y = λ(2x + 2z) + μ(xz).

Subtract equation 2 from equation 1:

2x - 2y = λ(2y + 2z - 2x - 2z) + μ(yz - xz).

Simplify:

2(x - y) = λ(2(y -x)) + μ z(y -x).

Factor out (x - y):

2(x - y) = (x - y)(-2λ - μ z).

Assuming x ≠ y (if x=y, we can check that case separately), we can divide both sides by (x - y):

2 = -2λ - μ z.

Similarly, from equations 1 and 3, let's subtract equation 3 from equation 1.

Equation 1: 2x = λ(2y + 2z) + μ(yz),

Equation 3: 2z = λ(2x + 2y) + μ(xy).

Subtract 3 from 1:

2x - 2z = λ(2y + 2z - 2x - 2y) + μ(yz - xy).

Simplify:

2(x - z) = λ(2z - 2x) + μ z(y - x).

Factor:

2(x - z) = -4λ(x - z)/2 + μ z (y - x).

Wait, perhaps better to factor 2(x - z):

2(x - z) = λ*(-2x + 2z) + μ z (y - x).

Wait, perhaps:

2(x - z) = λ* (2z - 2x) + μ z(y - x).

Factor out 2 in the first term:

2(x - z) = 2λ(z -x) + μ z (y -x).

Bring 2λ(z -x) to the left:

2(x - z) + 2λ(z -x) = μ z (y - x).

Factor (x - z):

(2 - 2λ)(x - z) = μ z (y - x).

Hmm, this is getting complicated. Maybe there's a better approach.

Alternatively, perhaps we can assume that the minimal x² + y² + z² occurs when two variables are equal, so x=y. Let's test this assumption because when I did that earlier, I got a feasible solution, but I'm not sure if it's the minimal.

Alternatively, perhaps the minimal occurs when all three variables are equal, but in that case, as we saw, the volume is 27, which is higher than 23, so that's not the case.

Wait, in the case where x=y=2, z=23/4, the sum x² + y² + z² is 657/16 ≈41.0625.

But maybe there's a configuration where x, y, z are not equal and this sum is smaller.

Alternatively, perhaps the minimal occurs when two variables are equal, but I need to verify.

Wait, perhaps using the AM-QM inequality or some other inequality.

Wait, another idea: For a given surface area and volume, perhaps the box with minimal space diagonal is the one that's as close to a cube as possible. But in our case, the cube gives a larger volume, so maybe the minimal occurs when variables are not equal.

Wait, perhaps it's better to proceed with the Lagrange multipliers approach.

From the earlier steps, we had from equations 1 and 2:

2 = -2λ - μ z.

Similarly, perhaps from equations 2 and 3, we can get another equation.

From equation 2: 2y = λ(2x + 2z) + μ(xz).

From equation 3: 2z = λ(2x + 2y) + μ(xy).

Subtract equation 3 from equation 2:

2y - 2z = λ(2x + 2z - 2x - 2y) + μ(xz - xy).

Simplify:

2(y - z) = λ(2z - 2y) + μ x(z - y).

Factor:

2(y - z) = 2λ(z - y) + μ x(z - y).

Factor out (y - z):

2(y - z) = (z - y)(2λ + μ x).

Which can be written as:

2(y - z) = -(y - z)(2λ + μ x).

If y ≠ z, we can divide both sides by (y - z):

2 = - (2λ + μ x).

So, 2 = -2λ - μ x.

Earlier, from equation 1 and 2, we had 2 = -2λ - μ z.

So, from both, we have:

-2λ - μ x = 2,

-2λ - μ z = 2.

Therefore,

-2λ - μ x = -2λ - μ z → μ x = μ z.

If μ ≠ 0, then x = z.

If μ = 0, then let's see what happens. If μ=0,

From equation 1: 2x = λ(2y + 2z) → 2x = 2λ(y + z) → x = λ(y + z).

Similarly, equation 2: 2y = λ(2x + 2z) → 2y = 2λ(x + z) → y = λ(x + z).

Equation 3: 2z = λ(2x + 2y) → 2z = 2λ(x + y) → z = λ(x + y).

So, if μ=0, then x = λ(y + z), y = λ(x + z), z = λ(x + y).

Hmm, this seems symmetrical. Let me see if this holds.

Suppose x = y = z. Then, from surface area, 6x² =54 → x²=9 → x=3. Volume would be 27, which is not 23, so this is not acceptable. So, perhaps μ is not zero, so we must have x = z.

So, if x = z, then perhaps the variables are x, y, x.

So, let me set z = x.

Then, our constraints become:

Surface area: 2(xy + yx + xx) = 2(2xy + x²) =54 → 2xy + x² =27.

Volume: x * y * x = x² y =23 → y =23/(x²).

Substitute into surface area equation:

2x*(23/(x²)) + x² =27 → (46/x) + x² =27.

Multiply both sides by x:

x³ +46 =27x → x³ -27x +46=0.

Wait, this is the same cubic equation as when we assumed x=y. So, we get the same roots as before: x=2, x= -1+2√6 ≈3.898, and x= negative value.

So, same as before, x=2, y=23/(x²)=23/4=5.75, z=x=2.

But wait, in this case, x=z=2, y=5.75.

So, the sum x² + y² + z² = 2² + (23/4)² + 2² = 4 + (529/16) +4 = (64/16) + (529/16) + (64/16) = (64 + 529 +64)/16 = (657)/16.

So, same as before.

Wait, so if x=z=2, y=5.75, then the sum is 657/16.

But earlier, when I assumed x=y, I also got the same sum.

Hmm, so both cases when x=y and x=z lead to the same sum.

But wait, perhaps the minimal occurs when all three variables are different.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the minimal sum occurs when x, y, z are not necessarily equal or two equal. So, perhaps
