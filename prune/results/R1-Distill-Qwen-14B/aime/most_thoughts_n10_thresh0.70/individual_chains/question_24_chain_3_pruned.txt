Okay, so I've got this math problem here, and I need to figure out the sum of the squares of all the items in the list. Let's see what the problem says:

1. The sum of the items is 30.
2. The unique mode is 9.
3. The median is a positive integer that doesn't appear in the list.

Hmm, let me break this down step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to think it through.

First, let's recall some definitions to make sure I'm on the right track.

- **Sum**: The total when all numbers are added together. So, the sum is 30.
- **Mode**: The number that appears most frequently. And it's unique, meaning only 9 is the mode. So, 9 must appear more times than any other number.
- **Median**: The middle number when the list is ordered from smallest to largest. If there's an even number of items, it's the average of the two middle numbers. But here, the median is a positive integer that doesn't appear in the list. That's interesting because usually, the median is one of the numbers, but not in this case.

So, I need to construct a list of positive integers that meets all these conditions. Let's outline the steps I need to take:

1. Determine the number of elements in the list. Wait, the problem doesn't specify how many numbers are in the list. Hmm. That could complicate things. Maybe I have to consider possible lengths and see which ones fit.

Wait, but the median is a positive integer not in the list. Let's think about what that implies.

If the list has an odd number of elements, the median is the middle number, right? But that number must not be in the list. Wait, that can't happen because the median is one of the numbers if the list has an odd count. So, if the median isn't in the list, the list must have an even number of elements. Because then the median is the average of two middle numbers, which might not be in the list itself.

Let me confirm: For a list with an even number of elements, say 2k, the median is the average of the k-th and (k+1)-th elements. So, if this average is not an integer, it might not be in the list. But wait, the problem says the median is a positive integer. So, even though it's the average of two numbers, it must be an integer. That means the two middle numbers must add up to an even number, so their average is an integer.

But since the median is a positive integer that's not in the list, the two middle numbers must add up to twice the median, but neither of them is equal to the median. So, for example, if the median is m, then the two middle numbers could be m-1 and m+1. Their average would be m, but neither is equal to m.

Wait, but could that be? Let me take an example. Suppose the list is [1, 2, 3, 4]. The median is (2+3)/2 = 2.5, which isn't an integer. So that
