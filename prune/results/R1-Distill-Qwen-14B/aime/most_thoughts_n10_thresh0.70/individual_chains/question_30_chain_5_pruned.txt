Okay, so I'm trying to solve this problem where I need to find the remainder when the product ∏ₖ₌₀¹² (2 - 2ωᵏ + ω²ᵏ) is divided by 1000. Here, ω is a 13th root of unity, not equal to 1. Hmm, okay, let me break this down.

First, I remember that roots of unity have some nice properties, especially cyclotomic polynomials. Maybe I can use those somehow. Also, since ω is a primitive 13th root of unity, ω^13 = 1, and the minimal polynomial over the integers is the 13th cyclotomic polynomial, which is Φ₁₃(x) = x¹² + x¹¹ + ... + x + 1. But I'm not sure yet how that connects to the product given.

Looking at the product, each term is 2 - 2ωᵏ + ω²ᵏ. Let me see if I can factor this or find a pattern. Maybe I can factor each term:

2 - 2ωᵏ + ω²ᵏ = ω²ᵏ - 2ωᵏ + 2. Hmm, that looks a bit like a quadratic in ωᵏ. Let me treat ωᵏ as a variable, say z. Then the expression becomes z² - 2z + 2. Maybe I can factor this quadratic or relate it to cyclotomic polynomials.

Wait, z² - 2z + 2 factors as (z - 1 - i)(z - 1 + i), where i is the imaginary unit. But I'm not sure if that helps directly here. Alternatively, I could think about evaluating the product over all k from 0 to 12, which would be the same as evaluating the product over all 13th roots of unity, except that when k=0, ω⁰=1.

Wait, when k=0, the term becomes 2 - 2*1 + 1² = 2 - 2 + 1 = 1. So the first term is 1, and then the rest from k=1 to 12.

So the product is 1 * ∏ₖ₌₁¹² (2 - 2ωᵏ + ω²ᵏ). Maybe I can write this product as ∏
