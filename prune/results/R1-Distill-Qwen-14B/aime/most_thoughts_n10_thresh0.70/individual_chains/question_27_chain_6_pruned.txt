Okay, so I have this problem about a torus and a sphere, and I need to find the difference between two radii, r_i and r_o, where r_i is the radius when the torus is internally tangent to the sphere, and r_o is when it's externally tangent. Then, I have to express the difference as a fraction m/n and find m + n. 

First, let me visualize the problem. A torus is like a donut shape, right? It's formed by revolving a circle around an axis that's in the same plane as the circle but doesn't pass through its center. In this case, the circle has radius 3, and the distance from the center of the circle to the axis of revolution is 6. So, the torus has a major radius (the distance from the center of the generating circle to the axis) of 6 and a minor radius (the radius of the generating circle) of 3.

The sphere has a radius of 11. So, when the torus is placed inside the sphere and tangent to it, the sphere is larger, and the torus touches the inside of the sphere along a circle. Similarly, when the torus is placed outside, the sphere is inside the torus, and they touch along another circle.

Wait, no, actually, when the torus is resting on the inside of the sphere, it's entirely inside the sphere, and they touch along a circle. Conversely, when it's resting on the outside, the torus encloses the sphere, and they touch along a circle. So, in both cases, the sphere is either inside or outside the torus, and the points of tangency form circles on the sphere and torus.

I need to find the radii of these circles, r_i and r_o, and then find their difference.

I think I need to figure out the distance from the center of the sphere to the center of the torus in each case. Maybe I can model the torus as a surface in 3D space and find the points where it's tangent to the sphere.

Let me recall: the equation of a torus can be described in a coordinate system where the axis of revolution is the z-axis. The standard equation is (sqrt(x^2 + y^2) - R)^2 + z^2 = r^2, where R is the major radius, and r is the minor radius. In this case, R is 6 and r is 3. So the equation is (sqrt(x^2 + y^2) - 6)^2 + z^2 = 9.

The sphere has a radius of 11, so its equation is x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = 11^2 = 121.

When the torus is inside the sphere, their surfaces are tangent along a circle. Similarly, when the torus is outside, they are tangent along another circle. The points of tangency must satisfy both the torus equation and the sphere equation, and their gradients (normals) must be equal at those points.

So, the gradients of the torus and sphere surfaces must be equal at the point of tangency.

Let me compute the gradients. For the sphere, the gradient is (2x, 2y, 2z). For the torus, I'll compute the gradient of F(x,y,z) = (sqrt(x^2 + y^2) - 6)^2 + z^2 - 9 = 0.

So, F = (sqrt(x^2 + y^2) - 6)^2 + z^2 - 9.

Compute the partial derivatives:

dF/dx = 2*(sqrt(x^2 + y^2) - 6)*( (x)/(sqrt(x^2 + y^2)) )
dF/dy = 2*(sqrt(x^2 + y^2) - 6)*( (y)/(sqrt(x^2 + y^2)) )
dF/dz = 2z

So, the gradient vector is [ 2*(sqrt(x^2 + y^2) - 6)*(x / sqrt(x^2 + y^2)), 2*(sqrt(x^2 + y^2) - 6)*(y / sqrt(x^2 + y^2)), 2z ]

The gradient of the sphere is (2x, 2y, 2z).

At the point of tangency, these gradients must be scalar multiples of each other. So, there exists a scalar λ such that:

2*(sqrt(x^2 + y^2) - 6)*(x / sqrt(x^2 + y^2)) = λ * 2x
2*(sqrt(x^2 + y^2) - 6)*(y / sqrt(x^2 + y^2)) = λ * 2y
2z = λ * 2z

Let me simplify these equations. First, the third equation: 2z = λ*2z. So, either z = 0 or λ = 1.

If z ≠ 0, then λ must be 1. If z = 0, then the first two equations must hold.

Let me first consider the case where z ≠ 0, so λ = 1.

Then, from the first equation:

2*(sqrt(x^2 + y^2) - 6)*(x / sqrt(x^2 + y^2)) = 2x
Divide both sides by 2x (assuming x ≠ 0):

(sqrt(x^2 + y^2) - 6) / sqrt(x^2 + y^2) = 1

Multiply both sides by sqrt(x^2 + y^2):

sqrt(x^2 + y^2) - 6 = sqrt(x^2 + y^2)

Subtract sqrt(x^2 + y^2) from both sides:

-6 = 0

That's a contradiction. So, z cannot be non-zero in this case. Therefore, our assumption that z ≠ 0 and λ=1 leads to a contradiction. So, we must have z=0.

So, the point of tangency must lie in the plane z=0.

So, now, z=0. Let's substitute z=0 into both the sphere and torus equations.

Sphere equation: x^2 + y^2 = 121.

Torus equation: (sqrt(x^2 + y^2) - 6)^2 + 0 = 9.

So, sqrt(x^2 + y^2) must satisfy (sqrt(x^2 + y^2) - 6)^2 = 9.

Taking square roots on both sides:

sqrt(x^2 + y^2) - 6 = ±3.

So, sqrt(x^2 + y^2) = 6 + 3 = 9 or sqrt(x^2 + y^2) = 6 - 3 = 3.

But since sqrt(x^2 + y^2) is the radius in the sphere, and the sphere has a radius of 11, sqrt(x^2 + y^2) must be less than or equal to 11. Both 9 and 3 are less than 11, so both are possible.

But in the case of internal and external tangency, which solution do we take?

Wait, when the torus is inside the sphere, the points of tangency would be where the torus is closest to the center of the sphere. When the torus is outside, it's where the torus is farthest from the center.

Wait, but the torus is a surface—so it's a bit ambiguous. Let me think.

Wait, in the case of internal tangency, the sphere is larger, so the torus is inside. The circle of tangency would be the largest circle on the torus that is inside the sphere. Alternatively, for external tangency, the sphere is inside the torus, but since the sphere is fixed at radius 11, the torus must be large enough to enclose the sphere. But in our case, the torus might not necessarily enclose the sphere when it's externally tangent. Hmm, maybe I need to think differently.

Wait, the sphere is fixed with radius 11, and the torus has major radius 6 and minor radius 3. So, the distance from the center of the generating circle (which is at distance 6 from the axis) to the center of the sphere—if we place the two centers coinciding, then the distance from the torus's center to the sphere's center is zero.

Wait, perhaps I need to model the torus such that its center is at the same point as the sphere's center.

Wait, maybe that's the case. So, in both cases, the center of the sphere is at the same point as the center of the torus's generating circle. So, when the torus is inside the sphere, it's smaller, and when it's outside, the sphere is inside the torus.

Wait, but the torus is a surface, so it's a closed surface. So, when it's externally tangent, the sphere is
