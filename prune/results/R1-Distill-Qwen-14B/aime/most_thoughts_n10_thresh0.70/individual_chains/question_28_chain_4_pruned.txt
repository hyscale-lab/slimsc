Okay, so I have this problem about a tetrahedron ABCD. The edges are given in pairs: AB and CD are both sqrt(41), AC and BD are sqrt(80), and BC and AD are sqrt(89). I need to find the distance from the incenter (the point equidistant from all faces) to each face. The answer should be in the form m*sqrt(n)/p, with m and p coprime and n square-free. Then find m + n + p.

Hmm, I remember that in a tetrahedron, the inradius can be found by the formula r = 3V / S, where V is the volume and S is the total surface area. So I need to compute the volume and the surface area.

First, let me think about the structure of the tetrahedron. It's given that opposite edges are equal. AB=CD, AC=BD, BC=AD. That suggests that the tetrahedron might be isohedral, but I'm not entirely sure. Maybe it's a kind of symmetric tetrahedron.

Wait, no, isohedral means all faces are congruent, which isn't necessarily the case here. But perhaps it's a disphenoid, which is a tetrahedron where opposite edges are equal. Yes, that's right. A disphenoid is a tetrahedron with four congruent triangular faces, but here the edges are in pairs. Maybe it's a regular disphenoid, but not regular since the edges are different.

In a disphenoid, the volume can be computed using the formula sqrt( (a^2 + b^2 - c^2)(a^2 + c^2 - b^2)(b^2 + c^2 - a^2) ) / 72, but I'm not sure if that's applicable here. Alternatively, maybe I can use the Cayley-Menger determinant to find the volume.

Cayley-Menger determinant for a tetrahedron with edge lengths AB = a, AC = b, AD = c, BC = d, BD = e, CD = f. The formula is:

Volume = sqrt( |CM| / 288 ), where CM is the determinant of the matrix:

| 0   1    1    1    1  |
| 1   0   a²   b²   c² |
| 1  a²   0    d²   e² |
| 1  b²  d²    0    f² |
| 1  c²  e²   f²    0  |

So, plugging in the given edge lengths.

Wait, let me list all the edges:

AB = sqrt(41), so AB² = 41.

AC = sqrt(80), AC² = 80.

AD = sqrt(89), AD² = 89.

BC = sqrt(89), BC² = 89.

BD = sqrt(80), BD² = 80.

CD = sqrt(41), CD² = 41.

So the edge lengths squared are:

AB² = a² = 41,

AC² = b² = 80,

AD² = c² = 89,

BC² = d² = 89,

BD² = e² = 80,

CD² = f² = 41.

So the Cayley-Menger determinant matrix will be:

Row 0: 0, 1, 1, 1, 1

Row 1: 1, 0, 41, 80, 89

Row 2: 1, 41, 0, 89, 80

Row 3: 1, 80, 89, 0, 41

Row 4: 1, 89, 80, 41, 0

Wait, is that correct? Let me make sure.

Each row corresponds to points O, A, B, C, D, right? So the first row is 0, 1, 1, 1, 1. Then the first column is 0, 1, 1, 1, 1.

The second row is 1, 0, AB², AC², AD² → 1, 0, 41, 80, 89.

Third row is 1, AB², 0, BC², BD² → 1, 41, 0, 89, 80.

Fourth row is 1, AC², BC², 0, CD² → 1, 80, 89, 0, 41.

Fifth row is 1, AD², BD², CD², 0 → 1, 89, 80, 41, 0.

Yes, that seems correct.

So, Cayley-Menger determinant is the determinant of this 5x5 matrix. Let me write it out:

CM = 
[ [0, 1, 1, 1, 1],
  [1, 0, 41, 80, 89],
  [1, 41, 0, 89, 80],
  [1, 80, 89, 0, 41],
  [1, 89, 80, 41, 0] ]

Calculating this determinant might be a bit tedious, but perhaps there's some symmetry I can exploit. Let me look for patterns.

Notice that the matrix is symmetric. The positions are symmetric across the diagonal. Maybe we can compute this determinant using some properties of symmetric matrices or block matrices. Alternatively, perhaps we can perform row or column operations to simplify it.

Alternatively, perhaps I can note that the determinant can be written in terms of smaller determinants.

Wait, another approach: since all the rows and columns have a certain structure, maybe the determinant can be factored. Alternatively, since the matrix is symmetric, perhaps it's a kind of circulant matrix, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps I can subtract some rows or columns to create zeros.

Looking at the matrix:

Row 0: 0, 1, 1, 1, 1

Row 1: 1, 0, 41, 80, 89

Row 2: 1, 41, 0, 89, 80

Row 3: 1, 80, 89, 0, 41

Row 4: 1, 89, 80, 41, 0

Hmm, each row after the first has a certain pattern. Rows 1-4 are permutations of each other. Hmm, perhaps we can subtract Row 1 from Rows 2, 3, 4 to create zeros in the first column.

Wait, but Row 1 is [1, 0, 41, 80, 89], and Rows 2, 3, 4 are [1,41,0,89,80], [1,80,89,0,41], [1,89,80,41,0].

If I subtract Row 1 from Rows 2, 3, 4, what do I get?

Row 2 - Row 1: [1-1,41-0, 0-41,89-80,80-89] → [0,41,-41,9,-9]

Row 3 - Row 1: [1-1,80-0,89-41,0-80,41-89] → [0,80,48,-80,-48]

Row 4 - Row 1: [1-1,89-0,80-41,41-80,0-89] → [0,89,39,-39,-89]

So the new matrix after row operations:

Row 0: 0, 1, 1, 1, 1

Row 1: 1, 0, 41, 80, 89

Row 2: 0,41,-41,9,-9

Row 3: 0,80,48,-80,-48

Row 4: 0,89,39,-39,-89

Now, the first column has 0,1,0,0,0. So the determinant is the same as expanding along the first column.

The determinant is 0*(minor) -1*(minor) + 0*(...) - 0*(...) + 0*(...). So it's -1 times the minor of the element at (1,0).

What's the minor? The minor is the determinant of the 4x4 matrix obtained by removing row 1 and column 0. So the minor is the determinant of:

[ [1,1,1,1],
  [41,-41,9,-9],
  [80,48,-80,-48],
  [89,39,-39,-89] ]

Wait, no. Wait, when you remove row 1 and column 0, the remaining rows are Row 0, 2, 3, 4 and columns 1,2,3,4.

So the minor matrix is:

Row 0 (original): 1,1,1,1

Row 2:41,-41,9,-9

Row 3:80,48,-80,-48

Row 4:89,39,-39,-89

So the minor is the determinant of this 4x4 matrix.

Let me write it as:

M = 
[ [1, 1, 1, 1],
  [41, -41, 9, -9],
  [80, 48, -80, -48],
  [89, 39, -39, -89] ]

Calculating this determinant. Hmm, 4x4 determinant. Let's see.

I can try to perform row operations to simplify it.

First, notice that Row 2 and Row 3 have some common factors. Let me factor them:

Row 2: 41, -41, 9, -9 → notice that entries 1 and 2 are 41 and -41, entries 3 and 4 are 9 and -9.

Similarly, Row 3: 80,48,-80,-48. Entries 1 and 3 are 80 and -80, entries 2 and 4 are 48 and -48.

Row 4: 89,39,-39,-89. Entries 1 and 4 are 89 and -89, entries 2 and 3 are 39 and -39.

Hmm, interesting. So each of Rows 2,3,4 has pairs of terms that are negatives of each other in positions (1,2), (3,4); (1,3), (2,4); (1,4), (2,3) respectively.

Wait, perhaps there's a pattern here. Maybe the determinant can be simplified by some symmetry.

Alternatively, perhaps we can subtract rows to create zeros.

Let me try subtracting Row 2 from Row 3 and Row 4. Let's see:

Compute Row3 - Row2: (80-41, 48 - (-41), -80 - 9, -48 - (-9)) → (39, 89, -89, -39)

Row4 - Row2: (89-41, 39 - (-41), -39 -9, -89 - (-9)) → (48, 80, -48, -80)

Wait, that's interesting. So Row3 - Row2 gives (39, 89, -89, -39)

Row4 - Row2 gives (48, 80, -48, -80)

Wait, these look similar to Row3 and Row4 in the original matrix.

Wait, perhaps if I perform these operations, I can find a pattern.

But maybe another approach. Let me subtract Row 2 from Row 3 and Row 4, and then see if I can factor something out.

Wait, let me denote:

Row3' = Row3 - Row2: [39, 89, -89, -39]

Row4' = Row4 - Row2: [48, 80, -48, -80]

Now, let's see if these rows have common factors.

Row3': 39,89,-89
