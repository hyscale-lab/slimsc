Okay, let's try to figure out this geometry problem. So, we have two rectangles, ABCD and EFGH. The points D, E, C, F are collinear, which means they all lie on the same straight line. Also, the points A, D, H, G all lie on a circle. We're given some side lengths: BC is 16, AB is 107, FG is 17, and EF is 184. We need to find the length of CE.

Hmm, first, I should probably draw a diagram to visualize this setup. Since both ABCD and EFGH are rectangles, their opposite sides are equal and all angles are right angles. Let me label the rectangles accordingly.

Let me consider rectangle ABCD first. Since AB is 107 and BC is 16, that means the sides AB and CD are 107 units long, and the sides BC and AD are 16 units long. So, AB = CD = 107, BC = AD = 16.

Now, rectangle EFGH. EF is 184 and FG is 17. So, EF and GH are 184 units, and FG and EH are 17 units.

Points D, E, C, F are collinear. So, if I imagine the line DC, points E and F lie somewhere on it. Wait, but D is a corner of ABCD, and C is the adjacent corner. So, the line DC is a side of the rectangle ABCD. But E and F are points on that line? Or is it another line? Wait, the problem says D, E, C, F are collinear. So, the order must be D, E, C, F or some other order? Hmm, maybe D-E-C-F or D-C-E-F? Not sure yet, but we'll figure that out.

Also, A, D, H, G lie on a circle. That means these four points form a cyclic quadrilateral. So, the quadrilateral ADHG is cyclic. That should give us some properties to work with, like opposite angles summing to 180 degrees or something with the power of a point.

Let me think about the coordinates. Maybe assigning coordinates to each point will help. Let's set point D at the origin (0,0). Since ABCD is a rectangle, if D is at (0,0), then C would be at (BC, 0) but wait, BC is 16. Wait, ABCD is a rectangle, so sides AD and BC are 16. So, if D is at (0,0), then A would be at (0, AB), which is (0,107). Then, point B would be at (BC, AB) = (16, 107), and point C would be at (16, 0). So, ABCD has coordinates: A(0,107), B(16,107), C(16,0), D(0,0).

Now, points D, E, C, F are collinear on the line DC. Wait, DC is from (0,0
