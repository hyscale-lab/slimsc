Okay, so I've got this problem about a torus and a sphere. The torus is created by revolving a circle of radius 3 around an axis that's in the same plane as the circle but 6 units away from its center. So, like a donut shape. Then there's a sphere with radius 11. The torus can rest inside the sphere and be tangent along a circle with radius r_i, or rest outside and be tangent along a circle with radius r_o. I need to find the difference r_i - r_o and express it as a reduced fraction m/n, then find m+n.

Hmm, okay. So first, I should probably visualize what's going on. A torus is a surface of revolution, right? So when you revolve a circle around an external axis, you get a donut shape. The distance from the center of the original circle to the axis of revolution is called the major radius, R, and the radius of the original circle is the minor radius, r.

In this case, the original circle has radius 3, and the distance from its center to the axis is 6. So R = 6, r = 3.

Now, the sphere has a radius of 11. When the torus is inside the sphere, it's tangent along a circle. Similarly, when it's outside, it's tangent along another circle.

I think the key here is to find the points where the torus is tangent to the sphere. Since both are surfaces of revolution, their points of tangency should lie along a circle in a plane perpendicular to the axis of the torus.

Let me think about the geometry. When the torus is inside the sphere, the closest points on the torus to the center of the sphere should be touching the sphere. Similarly, when it's outside, the farthest points on the torus should be touching.

Wait, but actually, the sphere is fixed, so when the torus is inside, the sphere is larger, so the torus touches the sphere at some points. When the torus is outside, it's tangent externally.

I should perhaps model this in coordinates. Let's choose a coordinate system where the axis of the torus is the z-axis. So the torus is centered at the origin, right?

The equation of a torus in cylindrical coordinates (r, θ, z) is given by:

√(R² - z²) = r,

but wait, no, that's not quite right. Let me recall the standard equation of a torus. In cylindrical coordinates, the torus is defined by (R - r cos θ)² + z² = r², where R is the major radius and r is the minor radius. So in our case, R = 6, r = 3.

So the equation becomes (6 - 3 cos θ)² + z² = 3².

Expanding that, (36 - 36 cos θ + 9 cos² θ) + z² = 9.

Simplify: 36 - 36 cos θ + 9 cos² θ + z² = 9.

So 27 - 36 cos θ + 9 cos² θ + z² = 0.

Hmm, not sure if that helps yet.

Alternatively, maybe it's better to consider the distance from the origin (the center of the sphere) to a point on the torus.

The sphere has radius 11, so when the torus is inside, the distance from the origin to any point on the torus is 11. When it's outside, the distance is 11 as well, but on the outside.

Wait, no. When the torus is inside the sphere, it's tangent, so the maximum distance from the origin to the torus is 11. When it's outside, the minimum distance is 11.

Alternatively, maybe I should parameterize a point on the torus and then find the
