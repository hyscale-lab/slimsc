Okay, so I have this problem about a tetrahedron ABCD. The edges are given in pairs: AB equals CD, both sqrt(41); AC equals BD, both sqrt(80); and BC equals AD, both sqrt(89). There's a point I inside the tetrahedron such that the distances from I to each of the four faces are equal. I need to find this distance, which is said to be in the form m√n/p, and then compute m + n + p.

Hmm, I remember that in a tetrahedron, the point equidistant from all faces is called the incenter, similar to the incenter of a triangle. The distance from the incenter to each face is called the inradius. So, I need to find the inradius of this tetrahedron.

To find the inradius, I think I need to know the volume of the tetrahedron and the sum of the areas of its faces. The formula, if I recall correctly, is similar to the 2D case: inradius = 3 * volume / (sum of the areas of the faces). Wait, no, actually, in 3D, the inradius r is given by r = 3V / S, where V is the volume and S is the total surface area (sum of the areas of all four faces). That sounds right because in 2D, it's area divided by semiperimeter, and in 3D, it's 3 times volume divided by the surface area.

So, my plan is:

1. Calculate the volume V of tetrahedron ABCD.
2. Calculate the areas of each of the four triangular faces.
3. Sum the areas to get S.
4. Compute r = 3V / S.

Alright, let's start with step 1: finding the volume. Since all opposite edges are equal, this tetrahedron might be a special kind, maybe a "equifacial" tetrahedron, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, it might be a tetrahedron where all pairs of opposite edges are equal, which is sometimes called a disphenoid. Yes, I think that's the term. A disphenoid is a tetrahedron where each pair of opposite edges are equal. So, this must be a disphenoid.

I remember that for a disphenoid, there is a formula for the volume. Let me recall. The formula involves the edges and some kind of determinant or maybe using Heron's formula on the faces. Alternatively, since it's a disphenoid, it can be embedded in a coordinate system in a symmetric way.

Wait, another approach: using coordinates. Maybe I can assign coordinates to the vertices such that the tetrahedron is symmetric, which might make calculations easier.

Let me try that. Let me place the tetrahedron in 3D coordinate space. Since opposite edges are equal, perhaps I can place the points symmetrically.

Let’s suppose that points A, B, C, D are placed such that:

- Point A is at (a, b, c)
- Point B is at (-a, -b, c)
- Point C is at (-a, b, -c)
- Point D is at (a, -b, -c)

This setup ensures that the opposite edges are equal because of the symmetry. Let me check: AB would be the distance between (a, b, c) and (-a, -b, c). Let's compute AB:

AB = sqrt[(a - (-a))² + (b - (-b))² + (c - c)²] = sqrt[(2a)² + (2b)² + 0] = sqrt(4a² + 4b²) = 2 sqrt(a² + b²). 

Similarly, CD is the distance between (-a, b, -c) and (a, -b, -c): sqrt[( -a - a )² + (b - (-b))² + (-c - (-c))²] = sqrt[(-2a)² + (2b)² + 0] = sqrt(4a² + 4b²) = 2 sqrt(a² + b²). So AB = CD, as desired.

Similarly, let's compute AC: distance between (a, b, c) and (-a, b, -c):

sqrt[(a - (-a))² + (b - b)² + (c - (-c))²] = sqrt[(2a)^2 + 0 + (2c)^2] = sqrt(4a² + 4c²) = 2 sqrt(a² + c²). 

Similarly, BD is distance between (-a, -b, c) and (a, -b, -c):

sqrt[(-a - a)^2 + (-b - (-b))^2 + (c - (-c))^2] = sqrt[(-2a)^2 + 0 + (2c)^2] = sqrt(4a² + 4c²) = 2 sqrt(a² + c²). So AC = BD, which is correct.

Similarly, BC is distance between (-a, -b, c) and (-a, b, -c):

sqrt[(-a - (-a))^2 + (-b - b)^2 + (c - (-c))^2] = sqrt[0 + (-2b)^2 + (2c)^2] = sqrt(4b² + 4c²) = 2 sqrt(b² + c²). 

AD is distance between (a, -b, -c) and (a, b, c):

sqrt[(a - a)^2 + (-b - b)^2 + (-c - c)^2] = sqrt[0 + (-2b)^2 + (-2c)^2] = sqrt(4b² + 4c²) = 2 sqrt(b² + c²). So BC = AD, as needed.

Great, so this coordinate system works. Now, the edges are given as AB = CD = sqrt(41), AC = BD = sqrt(80), BC = AD = sqrt(89). 

So, from above:

AB = 2 sqrt(a² + b²) = sqrt(41)

AC = 2 sqrt(a² + c²) = sqrt(80)

BC = 2 sqrt(b² + c²) = sqrt(89)

So, let's write equations:

1) 2 sqrt(a² + b²) = sqrt(41) → sqrt(a² + b²) = sqrt(41)/2 → a² + b² = 41/4

2) 2 sqrt(a² + c²) = sqrt(80) → sqrt(a² + c²) = sqrt(80)/2 → a² + c² = 80/4 = 20

3) 2 sqrt(b² + c²) = sqrt(89) → sqrt(b² + c²) = sqrt(89)/2 → b² + c² = 89/4

So, now, we have three equations:

a² + b² = 41/4 ... (1)

a² + c² = 20 ... (2)

b² + c² = 89/4 ... (3)

We can solve these equations for a², b², c².

Let me subtract equation (1) from equation (2):

(a² + c²) - (a² + b²) = 20 - 41/4 → c² - b² = (80/4 - 41/4) = 39/4 ... (4)

From equation (3), b² + c² = 89/4 ... (3)

Now, equations (3) and (4):

We have:

c² - b² = 39/4

c² + b² = 89/4

Adding these two equations:

2 c² = (39 + 89)/4 = 128/4 = 32 → c² = 16 → c = 4 (assuming positive, since distance can't be negative)

Then, from equation (2): a² + c² = 20 → a² + 16 = 20 → a² = 4 → a = 2

From equation (1): a² + b² = 41/4 → 4 + b² = 41/4 → b² = 41/4 - 16/4 = 25/4 → b = 5/2

So, now we have a = 2, b = 5/2, c = 4.

So, the coordinates are:

A = (2, 5/2, 4)

B = (-2, -5/2, 4)

C = (-2, 5/2, -4)

D = (2, -5/2, -4)

Wait, hold on, let me confirm: Point A is (a, b, c) = (2, 5/2, 4). Point B is (-a, -b, c) = (-2, -5/2, 4). Point C is (-a, b, -c) = (-2, 5/2, -4). Point D is (a, -b, -c) = (2, -5/2, -4). Yes, that looks correct.

Now, with these coordinates, I can compute the volume of the tetrahedron. The volume can be found using the scalar triple product formula. The formula for the volume V is |(AB × AC) · AD| / 6.

Wait, actually, the scalar triple product is
