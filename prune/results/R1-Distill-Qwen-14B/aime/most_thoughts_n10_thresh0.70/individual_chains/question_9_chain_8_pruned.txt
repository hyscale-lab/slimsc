Okay, so I have this problem here: there are real numbers x and y, both greater than 1, such that log base x of y^x equals 10 and log base y of x^{4y} also equals 10. I need to find the product xy. Hmm, that sounds a bit tricky, but let me try to break it down step by step.

First, I remember that logarithms can be rewritten using the change of base formula. Maybe that can help me here. So, starting with the first equation: log_x(y^x) = 10. Using the logarithm power rule, I know that log_b(a^c) = c*log_b(a). So, applying that here, this equation becomes x * log_x(y) = 10.

Wait, but log_x(y) is the logarithm of y with base x. I can express that as log(y)/log(x) if I switch the base to, say, base 10 or base e, but maybe that's not the easiest way here. Alternatively, I can let log_x(y) = k. Then the equation becomes x * k = 10. So, k = 10/x.

But since k is log_x(y), that means y = x^k. Substituting k from earlier, y = x^{10/x}. Okay, so that gives me an expression for y in terms of x. Let me note that down: y = x^{10/x}.

Now moving on to the second equation: log_y(x^{4y}) = 10. Again, applying the logarithm power rule, this becomes 4y * log_y(x) = 10. So, 4y * log_y(x) = 10.

Hmm, log_y(x) is the reciprocal of log_x(y), right? Because log_b(a) = 1 / log_a(b). So, since log_x(y) is k, then log_y(x) is 1/k. Therefore, substituting that into the second equation, I get 4y * (1/k) = 10.

But earlier, I found that k = 10/x, so 1/k is x/10. Substituting that in, the equation becomes 4y * (x/10) = 10. Let me simplify that: (4xy)/10 = 10. Multiplying both sides by 10, I get 4xy = 100. Dividing both sides by 4, I find that xy = 25.

Wait, that seems straightforward. But let me make sure I didn't make any wrong assumptions or skip a step. So, let's recap:

From the first equation:
log_x(y^x) = 10
Which simplifies to x * log_x(y) = 10
Let log_x(y) = k, so x * k = 10 => k = 10/x
Thus, y = x^{k} = x^{10/x}

From the second equation:
log_y(x^{4y}) = 10
Which simplifies to
