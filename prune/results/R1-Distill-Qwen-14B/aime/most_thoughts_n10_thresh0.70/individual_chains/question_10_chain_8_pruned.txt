Okay, so I'm trying to solve this math problem where Alice chooses a set A of positive integers. Then Bob lists all finite nonempty sets B of positive integers such that the maximum element of B is in A. Bob's list has 2024 sets, and I need to find the sum of the elements of A.

Hmm, let me try to understand the problem step by step. Alice picks a set A, which is a set of positive integers. Then Bob considers all finite nonempty sets B where the maximum element is in A. The number of such sets B is 2024. I need to find the sum of elements in A.

First, I think I should figure out how Bob counts the number of sets B for a given set A. Let's break it down. For a set A, each B is a finite nonempty set where max(B) is in A. So, for each element a in A, we can consider all possible sets B where the maximum is a. Then the total number of such B is the sum over each a in A of the number of subsets where the maximum is a.

Wait, no, that's not quite right. Because for each a in A, the sets B with max(B) = a can be formed by choosing any non-empty subset of {1, 2, ..., a} that includes a. Because the maximum is a, so a must be in the set, and all other elements must be less than or equal to a.

So for each a in A, the number of such sets B where max(B) = a is equal to 2^{a-1}. Because for each a, you can choose any subset of {1, 2, ..., a-1} and then include a. The number of subsets of {1,2,...,a-1} is 2^{a-1}, and since each of these subsets can be combined with a, that gives 2^{a-1} sets for each a.

But wait, I should double-check that. Let me take a small example. Suppose a=1. Then the set B can only be {1}, so number of sets is 1, which is 2^{1-1}=1. Correct.

If a=2, the sets are {2}, {1,2}. So that's 2 sets, which is 2^{2-1}=2. Correct.

Similarly, for a=3, the sets are {3}, {1,3}, {2,3}, {1,2,3}. That's 4 sets, which is 2^{3-1}=4. So yes, that formula holds.

Therefore, for each a in A, the number of sets B with max(B) = a is 2^{a-1}. So the total number of sets B is the sum over a in A of 2^{a-1}.

In the problem, Bob's list has 2024 sets. Therefore, the sum over a in A of 2^{a-1} equals 2024.

So, sum_{a in A} 2^{a-1} = 2024.

Let me denote S = sum_{a in A} 2^{a-1} = 2024.

Wait, but the question asks for the sum of the elements of A, not the sum of 2^{a-1}. So I need to find sum_{a in A} a, given that sum_{a in A} 2^{a-1} = 2024.

Hmm, so I have some set A of positive integers, and the sum of 2^{a-1} for all a in A is 2024. I need to figure out what A is, or at least compute the sum of its elements.

I think the problem is similar to binary representations. Because 2^{a-1} is a power of two, so each term in the sum is a distinct power of two. So perhaps A consists of numbers a where each 2^{a-1} is a power of two that adds up to 2024.

Wait, but 2024 is a specific number. Let me try to factor 2024 into powers of two and see if that gives me the elements of A.

Wait, but 2024 isn't a power of two. Let me see what 2024 is in binary. Let me compute 2024 divided by 2 repeatedly.

2024 /2=1012, remainder 0

1012/2=506, rem 0

506/2=253, rem 0

253/2=126 rem1

126/2=63 rem0

63/2=31 rem1

31/2=15 rem1

15/2=7 rem1

7/2=3 rem1

3/2=1 rem1

1/2=0 rem1

So writing the remainders from last to first: 11111101000.

Wait, let me double-check:

Compute 2^10=1024

2^11=2048.

So 2024 is between 2^10 and 2^11.

2024 - 1024 = 1000.

1000 is 512 + 256 + 128 + 64 + 8.

Wait, 512 is 2^9, which is 512.

2024 in binary would be 11111101000, as I thought earlier.

So 2024 is equal to 2^10 + 2^9 + 2^8 + 2^7 + 2^6 + 2^5 + 2^3.

Wait, let me count the 1s in the binary representation:

11111101000 has 7 ones. Wait, the positions are:

Starting from right, the bits are at positions 3, 6, 7, 8,9,10,11.

Wait, no. Let me count:

From the remainders, the first division gave me the least significant bit.

Wait, perhaps I should write it more carefully.

The binary of 2024 is 11111101000.

Let me count the digits:

From right to left: positions 0 to 10.

So the bits set are at positions 3,6,7,8,9,10,11.

Wait, but 2024 is 2^11 is 2048. So 2024 is 2048 - 24.

Wait, 2048 is 2^11, and 24 is 16 + 8, which is 2^4 + 2^3.

So 2024 = 2^11 - (2^4 + 2^3) = 2^11 - 2^4 - 2^3.

But that might complicate things. Alternatively, perhaps 2024 can be written as a sum of distinct powers of two.

Wait
