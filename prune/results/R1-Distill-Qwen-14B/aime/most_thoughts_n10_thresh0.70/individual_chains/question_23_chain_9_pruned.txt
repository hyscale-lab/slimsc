Okay, so I have this problem: There's a hyperbola given by the equation x²/20 - y²/24 = 1. Points A, B, C, D lie on this hyperbola, forming a rhombus ABCD. The diagonals of this rhombus intersect at the origin. I need to find the greatest real number that is less than BD² for all such rhombi. Essentially, I'm looking for the infimum (the greatest lower bound) of BD².

Hmm, let me start by recalling some properties of rhombuses. In a rhombus, all sides are equal in length, and the diagonals bisect each other at right angles. Wait, no, actually, in a rhombus, the diagonals bisect each other and bisect the angles, but they aren't necessarily perpendicular unless it's a square. Wait, no, I think I was right the first time—actually, in a rhombus, the diagonals are not necessarily perpendicular. Wait, no, I think I'm mixing things up. Let me double-check.

No, actually, in a rhombus, the diagonals are not perpendicular unless it's a square. Wait, no, that's a square. In a rhombus, the diagonals bisect each other at right angles. Yes, that's correct. So the diagonals are perpendicular bisectors of each other. So that means, since the diagonals intersect at the origin, each diagonal is split into two equal parts by the origin.

Given that, let's denote the diagonals as AC and BD. Since the diagonals intersect at the origin, points A and C are endpoints of one diagonal, and points B and D are endpoints of the other diagonal. So, if A is (x, y), then C must be (-x, -y). Similarly, if B is (p, q), then D must be (-p, -q). Because the origin is the midpoint of both diagonals.

Now, since ABCD is a rhombus, all four sides must be equal in length. So AB = BC = CD = DA.

But first, let me think about the coordinates of the points. Let's denote A as (x, y), so C is (-x, -y). Similarly, B is (p, q), so D is (-p, -q). So the four points are A(x, y), B(p, q
