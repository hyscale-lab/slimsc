Okay, let's try to solve this system of logarithmic equations. So, we have three equations:

1. log₂(x/(yz)) = 1/2
2. log₂(y/(xz)) = 1/3
3. log₂(z/(xy)) = 1/4

And we need to find the absolute value of log₂(x⁴y³z²), which will be a fraction m/n, then find m + n.

Hmm, logarithms can sometimes be tricky, but I remember that log₂(a/b) = log₂ a - log₂ b, so maybe I can rewrite each equation using that property.

Let me write each equation in terms of logs.

Starting with the first equation:

log₂(x) - log₂(y) - log₂(z) = 1/2.

Similarly, the second equation:

log₂(y) - log₂(x) - log₂(z) = 1/3.

And the third equation:

log₂(z) - log₂(x) - log₂(y) = 1/4.

Hmm, okay, so now we have three equations with three variables: log₂(x), log₂(y), log₂(z). Let's assign variables to make it easier. Let me let:

a = log₂(x),
b = log₂(y),
c = log₂(z).

So now the equations become:

1. a - b - c = 1/2
2. -a + b - c = 1/3
3. -a - b + c = 1/4

So now we have a system of three linear equations with three variables a, b, c.

Let me write them again:

1. a - b - c = 1/2
2. -a + b - c = 1/3
3. -a - b + c = 1/4

I need to solve for a, b, c. Let me try to add and subtract these equations to eliminate variables.

Maybe adding equation 1 and equation 2. Let's see:

Equation 1: a - b - c = 1/2
Equation 2: -a + b - c = 1/3
Adding them:
( a - a ) + (-b + b) + (-c - c) = 1/2 + 1/3
Simplifies to:
0 + 0 - 2c = 5/6
So, -2c = 5/6 => c = -5/(6*2) = -5/12.

Wait, c is negative? But z is a positive real number, so log₂(z) could be negative if z is between 0 and 1. Okay, that's fine.

So c = -5/12.

Now, let's try adding another pair. Maybe equation 1 and equation 3.

Equation 1: a - b - c = 1/2
Equation 3: -a - b + c = 1/4
Adding them:
(a - a) + (-b - b) + (-c + c) = 1/2 + 1/4
Which becomes:
0 - 2b + 0 = 3/4
So, -2b = 3/4 => b = -3/(4*2) = -3/8.

Hmm, b is also negative. So log₂(y) is negative, meaning y is less than 1.

Now, we have b = -3/8 and c = -5/12.

Now, let's find a. Let's use equation 1: a - b - c = 1/2

Substituting b and c:

a - (-3/8) - (-5/12) = 1/2

Simplify:

a + 3/8 + 5/12 = 1/2

Let me find a common denominator for the fractions. 8 and 12 have a common denominator of 24.

So, 3/8 = 9/24, 5/12 = 10/24, and 1/2 = 12/24.

So,

a + 9/24 + 10/24 = 12/24

Adding the fractions: 9 + 10 = 19, so 19/24.

So,

a + 19/24 = 12/24

Subtract 19/24 from both sides:

a = 12/24 - 19/24 = (12 - 19)/24 = (-7)/24.

So, a = -7/24.

Wait, all three a, b, c are negative. So x, y, z are all less than 1.

So now, we have:

a = log₂(x) = -7/24
b = log₂(y) = -3/8
c = log₂(z) = -5/12

We need to find |log₂(x⁴y³z²)|.

Let's compute log₂(x⁴y³z²). Using logarithm properties:

log₂(x⁴) + log₂(y³) + log₂(z²) = 4 log₂(x) + 3 log₂(y) + 2 log₂(z) = 4a + 3b + 2c.

Plug in the values:

4*(-7/24) + 3*(-3/8) + 2*(-5/12)

Let me compute each term:

4*(-7/24) = (-28)/24 = (-7)/6.

3*(-3/8) = (-9)/8.

2*(-5/12) = (-10)/12 = (-5)/6.

Now add them up:

(-7/6) + (-9/8) + (-5/6).

First, let's combine the terms with denominator 6:

(-7/6) + (-5/6) = (-12/6) = -2.

Now add (-9/8):

-2 + (-9/8) = -(2 + 9/8) = -(16/8 + 9/8) = -(25/8).

So, log₂(x⁴y³z²) = -25/8.

The absolute value is | -25/8 | = 25/8.

So, m = 25, n = 8. They are coprime.

Thus, m + n = 25 + 8 = 33.


To solve the given system of equations, we start by rewriting each logarithmic equation using the property \(\log_2\left(\frac{a}{b}\right) = \log_2 a - \log_2 b\). Let \(a = \log_2 x\), \(b = \log_2 y\), and \(c = \log_2 z\). The equations become:

1. \(a - b - c = \frac{1}{2}\)
2. \(-a + b - c = \frac{1}{3}\)
3. \(-a - b + c = \frac{1}{4}\)

Adding equations 1 and 2 eliminates \(a\):

\[
(a - b - c) + (-a + b - c) = \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{3} \implies -2c = \frac{5}{6} \implies c = -\frac{5}{12}
\]

Adding equations 1 and 3 eliminates \(a\):

\[
(a - b - c) + (-a - b + c) = \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{4} \implies -2b = \frac{3}{4} \implies b = -\frac{3}{8}
\]

Substituting \(b\) and \(c\) into equation 1 to find \(a\):

\[
a - \left(-\frac{3}{8}\right) - \left(-\frac{5}{12}\right) = \frac{1}{2} \implies a + \frac{3}{8} + \frac{5}{12} = \frac{1}{2}
\]

Converting to a common denominator:

\[
a + \frac{9}{24} + \frac{10}{24} = \frac{12}{24} \implies a + \frac{19}{24} = \frac{12}{24} \implies a = \frac{-7}{24}
\]

Now, we compute \(\log_2(x^4 y^3 z^2)\):

\[
4a + 3b + 2c = 4\left(-\frac{7}{24}\right) + 3\left(-\frac{3}{8}\right) + 2\left(-\frac{5}{12}\right) = -\frac{28}{24} - \frac{9}{8} - \frac{10}{12}
\]

Simplifying:

\[
-\frac{7}{6} - \frac{9}{8} - \frac{5}{6} = -\frac{25}{8}
\]

Taking the absolute value:

\[
\left|-\frac{25}{8}\right| = \frac{25}{8}
\]

Thus, \(m = 25\) and \(n = 8\), giving \(m + n = 33\).

\boxed{33}
