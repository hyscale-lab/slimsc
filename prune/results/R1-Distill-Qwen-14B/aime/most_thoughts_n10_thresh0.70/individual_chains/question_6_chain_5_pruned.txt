Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the number of intersections between two graphs: y = 4g(f(sin(2πx))) and x = 4g(f(cos(3πy))). Hmm, that looks a bit complicated, but let me try to break it down step by step.

First, let's understand the functions f and g. The problem defines f(x) as ||x| - 1/2| and g(x) as ||x| - 1/4|. So both f and g are absolute value functions with transformations. Maybe drawing their graphs will help. 

Starting with f(x). The inner function is |x|, which is a V-shape with the vertex at (0,0). Then we subtract 1/2, so that shifts the graph down by 1/2. But since we're taking the absolute value again, it's like reflecting any part that goes below the x-axis back up. So f(x) = ||x| - 1/2|.

Let me plot this mentally. At x=0, f(0) = |0 - 1/2| = 1/2. As x increases, |x| increases, so |x| - 1/2 becomes positive when |x| > 1/2. So for |x| ≥ 1/2, f(x) = |x| - 1/2, which is a V-shape with vertex at (1/2, 0) and (-1/2, 0). For |x| < 1/2, f(x) = | - (|x| - 1/2)| = 1/2 - |x|, which is a upside-down V with vertex at (0, 1/2). So f(x) is a W shape? Wait, no, it's two Vs back to back. So it's a diamond shape with peaks at (0, 1/2) and valleys at (±1/2, 0).

Similarly, g(x) = ||x| - 1/4|. Let's see. The inner absolute value is |x|, then subtract 1/4. Again, take absolute value. So at x=0, g(0) = |0 - 1/4| = 1/4. For |x| > 1/4, it's |x| - 1/4. For |x| < 1/4, it's 1/4 - |x|. So g(x) has peaks at (0, 1/4) and (±1/4, 0). So it's like a smaller version of f(x), with peaks at 1/4 instead of 1/2.

So now, f(x) and g(x) are both piecewise linear functions with specific shapes.

Now, the functions in the problem are composite. Let me take them one by one.

First, y = 4g(f(sin(2πx))). Let's parse this:

1. Start with sin(2πx). The sine function has a period of 1, because the period of sin(kx) is 2π/k, so here it's 2π/(2π) = 1. So sin(2πx) oscillates between -1 and 1, with period 1.

2. Then, apply f to it: f(sin(2πx)) = ||sin(2πx)| - 1/2|. Since sin(2πx) is between -1 and 1, |sin(2πx)| is between 0 and 1. So |sin(2πx)| - 1/2 is between -1/2 and 1/2. Taking the absolute value, f(sin(2πx)) will be between 0 and 1/2.

Wait, let me compute f(sin(2πx)):

Case 1: |sin(2πx)| ≥ 1/2. Then f(sin(2πx)) = |sin(2πx)| - 1/2.

Case 2: |sin(2πx)| < 1/2. Then f(sin(2πx)) = 1/2 - |sin(2πx)|.

So f(sin(2πx)) oscillates between 0 and 1/2, with a period of 1.

Then, apply g to that: g(f(sin(2πx))) = ||f(sin(2πx))| - 1/4|.

But since f(sin(2πx)) is already non-negative, we can drop the absolute value:

g(f(...)) = |f(...) - 1/4|.

So let's see, f(...) ranges from 0 to 1/2. So f(...) - 1/4 ranges from -1/4 to 1/4. Taking the absolute value, g(f(...)) ranges from 0 to 1/4.

So g(f(...)) is |f(...) - 1/4|, which is a V shape function with vertex at f(...) = 1/4. So when f(...) is 1/4, g(...) is 0. As f(...) goes above or below 1/4, g(...) increases.

Since f(...) is itself a function of sin(2πx), which is periodic, the entire function g(f(sin(2πx))) is periodic with period 1.

Then, the function y = 4g(f(sin(2πx))) will scale this by 4. Since g(...) ranges from 0 to 1/4, multiplying by 4 will bring it back to 0 to 1. So y ranges between 0 and 1.

Similarly, for the other equation: x = 4g(f(cos(3πy))). Let's break this down.

Starting with cos(3πy). The cosine function has a period of 2π/(3π) = 2/3. So cos(3πy) oscillates between -1 and 1 with period 2/3.

Then, f(cos(3πy)) = ||cos(3πy)| - 1/2|.

Same as before: |cos(3πy)| is between 0 and 1. So f(...) ranges from 0 to 1/2. Then, g(f(...)) = |f(...) - 1/4|, which is between 0 and 1/4. Multiply by 4, and x ranges from 0 to 1.

So both y and x are functions that take values between 0 and 1. So the graphs of y = 4g(f(sin(2πx))) and x = 4g(f(cos(3πy))) are both within the unit square [0,1] x [0,1].

Now, to find the number of intersections, I need to solve for (x, y) such that:

y = 4g(f(sin(2πx)))

and

x = 4g(f(cos(3πy)))

So we have a system of equations. It's a bit tricky because x is expressed in terms of y, and y is expressed in terms of x. So substituting one into the other might lead us somewhere.

Let me try substituting the expression for y into the equation for x.

x = 4g(f(cos(3πy))) = 4g(f(cos(3π * [4g(f(sin(2πx)))] )))

Wow, that's a complicated expression. It might not be easy to solve algebraically. Maybe a better approach is to analyze the functions and see how they behave.

Alternatively, since both functions are periodic, perhaps we can find the number of solutions by considering the periods and their interactions.

Let me think about the periods first.

For y = 4g(f(sin(2πx))), the inner function sin(2πx) has period 1. Each transformation after that, like f and g, are even functions, so they won't change the period. So y is periodic with period 1
