Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how many rectangles can be formed inside a regular dodecagon, which is a 12-sided polygon. Each side of the rectangle has to lie on either a side or a diagonal of the dodecagon. Hmm, that sounds a bit tricky, but let's break it down.

First, I know that a regular dodecagon has all its sides equal and all its internal angles equal. Each internal angle can be calculated using the formula ((n-2)*180)/n, where n is 12. So, each internal angle is (10*180)/12 = 150 degrees. That means each external angle is 30 degrees since the external angle is 180 - internal angle.

Now, the problem is about rectangles inside this shape. So, rectangles have four sides with opposite sides equal and four right angles. But in a regular dodecagon, the sides and diagonals aren't all equal; they vary in length depending on how far apart the vertices are. So, we'll have to figure out which sets of sides and diagonals can form right angles.

I think the key here is to consider the diagonals of the dodecagon. Since it's regular, the number and length of diagonals depend on the number of vertices they skip. For example, in a regular polygon, a diagonal can connect two non-adjacent vertices. In a dodecagon, each vertex is connected to 9 other vertices via diagonals (since it's connected to two adjacent ones via sides, not diagonals). But not all diagonals are the same length.

Wait, but for forming rectangles, the sides of the rectangle must be either sides or diagonals of the dodecagon. So, the sides of the rectangle must lie on these lines.

Hmm, maybe it's better to think in terms of selecting four points (vertices) that form a rectangle. But wait, in a regular polygon, not every four points form a rectangle. Only those that are symmetric in a certain way.

But wait, no, because the sides can also be diagonals. So, the sides of the rectangle can be diagonals of the dodecagon, meaning that the sides of the rectangle don't have to be aligned with the sides of the polygon but can be along longer connections. So, perhaps the rectangle is formed by connecting non-adjacent vertices.

Another thought: In a regular polygon, a rectangle can be formed if the four vertices are equally spaced in a certain way. For example, in a regular octagon, a rectangle can be formed by connecting every other vertex, which creates a square.

But in a dodecagon, which has 12 sides, maybe rectangles can be formed by selecting vertices that are certain steps apart.

Wait, but in a regular polygon, a rectangle requires that the four points form two pairs of parallel sides, which in the polygon would mean that the sides of the rectangle are either sides of the polygon or certain diagonals.

Alternatively, perhaps we can model the dodecagon on a coordinate system, with one vertex at (1,0) and then placing others around the unit circle. Then, the coordinates of each vertex can be determined using trigonometric functions. Maybe that would help in figuring out when four points
