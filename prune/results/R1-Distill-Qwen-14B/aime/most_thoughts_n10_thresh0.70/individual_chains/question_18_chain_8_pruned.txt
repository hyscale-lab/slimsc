Okay, so I need to find the number of rectangles that can be formed inside a regular dodecagon (12-gon). Each side of the rectangle must lie on either a side or a diagonal of the dodecagon. Hmm, interesting problem. Let me try to break this down.

First, I should visualize a regular dodecagon. It has 12 sides, all equal in length, and each internal angle is 150 degrees. The problem mentions that the sides of the rectangles lie on either sides or diagonals of the dodecagon. So, each rectangle is formed by selecting four vertices of the dodecagon such that the sides of the rectangle are either sides or diagonals of the dodecagon.

Wait, no, actually, not necessarily the sides, but any of the lines connecting the vertices, which can be sides, or longer diagonals. So, the sides of the rectangle can be either sides of the dodecagon or any of the diagonals (which can be of different lengths).

I remember that in regular polygons, the number of sides and diagonals can be calculated, but here, I'm more interested in the conditions that make four points form a rectangle. So, in a regular polygon, a rectangle can be formed if certain symmetries are present.

In a regular dodecagon, the vertices are equally spaced around a circle. So, any four vertices that form a rectangle would have to be such that their positions on the circle allow for perpendicular diameters. But wait, in a dodecagon, are all such rectangles possible?

Alternatively, maybe I should think in terms of choosing two pairs of points that are symmetric with respect to the center. Because for a rectangle, the opposite sides must be equal and parallel, and the diagonals must bisect each other. So, in the context of the dodecagon, this would mean that for each rectangle, there must be two pairs of diametrically opposite points, but perhaps not necessarily through the center.

Wait, no. Because in a regular polygon, diametrically opposite points only exist if the polygon has an even number of sides. Since dodecagon has 12 sides, which is even, so each vertex has a unique opposite vertex.

Wait, but for a rectangle, you need two pairs of such opposite points. So, perhaps selecting two pairs of opposite points, and
