Okay, so I've got this geometry problem here about triangle ABC. It says that the circumcenter is O, the incenter is I, and IA is perpendicular to OI. The circumradius is 13, and the inradius is 6. I need to find the product AB times AC. Hmm, okay, let me think about how to approach this.

First, let's recall some properties. The circumradius R is given as 13, and the inradius r is 6. The circumradius is the radius of the circumscribed circle around the triangle, and the inradius is the radius of the inscribed circle. So, O is the center of the circumcircle, and I is the center of the incircle.

The problem also states that IA is perpendicular to OI. So, the line from the incenter I to vertex A is perpendicular to the line from the incenter I to the circumcenter O. That must form a right angle at point I between IA and OI.

I'm trying to remember if there's a formula that relates the inradius, circumradius, and the distance between the incenter and circumcenter. Oh wait, there is a formula: the distance between the incenter and circumcenter, which is denoted as IO, is given by IO² = R(R - 2r). Let me check if I remember that correctly. Yes, I think that's right. So, IO² = R² - 2Rr.

Let me plug in the values here. R is 13, so R² is 169. 2Rr would be 2*13*6=156. So IO² = 169 - 156 = 13. Therefore, IO is sqrt(13). That seems right.

Now, since IA is perpendicular to OI, we can consider triangle AIO. In this triangle, IA is one leg, IO is another leg, and AO is the hypotenuse. Wait, because in triangle AIO, angle at I is 90 degrees, so it's a right-angled triangle.

So, in triangle AIO, by the Pythagorean theorem, AO² = IA² + IO².

But AO is the distance from the circumcenter O to vertex A, which is just the circumradius R, right? Because in any triangle, the distance from the circumcenter to a vertex is R. So AO = R =13. Therefore, AO² is 169.

We already found IO² is 13. So IA² = AO² - IO² = 169 - 13 = 156. Therefore, IA is sqrt(156). Simplifying sqrt(156), let's see: 156 = 4*39, so sqrt(4*39)=2*sqrt(39). So IA is 2*sqrt(39).

Okay, so now we know that the length from the inradius center I to vertex A is 2*sqrt(39). Hmm, how does that help me find AB*AC?

I remember that in a triangle, the length of the inradius can be expressed in terms of the area and the semiperimeter. The formula is r = area / s, where s is the semiperimeter. So, area is r*s.

But I also know another formula related to the inradius and the distances from the incenter to the vertices. Specifically, the distance from the incenter to a vertex can be expressed in terms of the angles and sides of the triangle. Wait, maybe I can use trigonometric identities here.

Let me think. The distance from the incenter I to a vertex, say A, can be expressed as IA = (r) / sin(A/2). Wait, is that correct? Let me recall: in triangle ABC, the distance from the incenter to vertex A is given by IA = (r) / sin(A/2). Yes, I think that's right. Because in the right triangle formed by the inradius, the ex-radius, and the angle.

So, if IA = (r) /
