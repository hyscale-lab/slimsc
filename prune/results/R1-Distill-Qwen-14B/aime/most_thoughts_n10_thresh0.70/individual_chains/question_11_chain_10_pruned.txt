Okay, so I've got this math problem here, and I need to find the largest possible real part of the expression \[(75 + 117i)z + \frac{96 + 144i}{z}\], where \( z \) is a complex number with \( |z| = 4 \). Hmm, let me break this down step by step.

First, I remember that any complex number \( z \) can be written in polar form. Since the magnitude of \( z \) is 4, we can express \( z \) as \( 4e^{i\theta} \), where \( \theta \) is the argument of \( z \). That might make things easier because dealing with exponents could simplify the expression.

So, let me substitute \( z = 4e^{i\theta} \) into the expression. Then, \( 1/z \) would be \( \frac{1}{4}e^{-i\theta} \) because \( |z| = 4 \) implies \( |1/z| = 1/4 \). So, the first term becomes \( (75 + 117i) \times 4e^{i\theta} \) and the second term becomes \( (96 + 144i) \times \frac{1}{4}e^{-i\theta} \).

Let me compute each term separately. 

Starting with the first term: \( (75 + 117i) \times 4e^{i\theta} \). I can factor out the 4: \( 4 \times (75 + 117i) e^{i\theta} \). Let's compute \( 4 \times (75 + 117i) \). That would be \( 300 + 468i \). So the first term is \( (300 + 468i)e^{i\theta} \).

Now the second term: \( (96 + 144i) \times \frac{1}{4}e^{-i\theta} \). Again, factor out the 1/4: \( \frac{1}{4} \times (96 + 144i) e^{-i\theta} \). Calculating \( (96 + 144i)/4 \), that's \( 24 + 36i \). So the second term is \( (24 + 36i)e^{-i\theta} \).

So now, the entire expression becomes \( (300 + 468i)e^{i\theta} + (24 + 36i)e^{-i\theta} \). Let me denote \( A = 300 + 468i \) and \( B = 24 + 36i \) for simplicity. So, the expression is \( A e^{i\theta} + B e^{-i\theta} \).

I recall that for complex numbers, expressions like \( A e^{i\theta} + B e^{-i\theta} \) can often be rewritten using Euler's formula. Let me expand both terms using Euler's formula, which states \( e^{i\theta} = \cos\theta + i\sin\theta \) and \( e^{-i\theta} = \cos\theta - i\sin\theta \).

So, substituting these into the expression, we get:
- \( A (\cos\theta + i\sin\theta) \) which is \( A\cos\theta + iA\sin\theta \)
- \( B (\cos\theta - i\sin\theta) \) which is \( B\cos\theta - iB\sin\theta \)

Adding these together:
\( (A\cos\theta + B\cos\theta) + i(A\sin\theta - B\sin\theta) \)

Simplify:
Real part: \( (A + B)\cos\theta \)
Imaginary part: \( (A - B)\sin\theta \)

But wait, that's not quite right. Because A and B are complex numbers, their sum and difference will also be complex. So, when I add A and B, I have to compute them as complex numbers.

Let me compute \( A + B \) and \( A - B \).

Given \( A = 300 + 468i \) and \( B = 24 + 36i \),
\( A + B = (300 + 24) + (468 + 36)i = 324 + 504i \)
\( A - B = (300 - 24) + (468 - 36)i = 276 + 432i \)

So, substituting back, the real part becomes \( (324 + 504i)\cos\theta \) and the imaginary part becomes \( (276 + 432i)\sin\theta \). Wait, but that doesn't make sense because \( (A + B)\cos\theta \) is a complex number, so the real part of the entire expression is the real part of \( (A + B)\cos\theta + (A - B)i\sin\theta \).

Wait, maybe I should approach this differently. Let me think. The original expression is \( A e^{i\theta} + B e^{-i\theta} \), and I can express this as:

\( A e^{i\theta} + B e^{-i\theta} = (A + B) \cos\theta + i(A - B) \sin\theta \)

But since A and B are complex, this expression is a complex number whose real part is \( \text{Re}(A + B) \cos\theta - \text{Im}(A - B) \sin\theta \) and the imaginary part is \( \text{Im}(A + B) \cos\theta + \text{Re}(A - B) \sin\theta \). Hmm, perhaps that's too convoluted.

Wait, maybe a better approach is to express the entire expression as a single complex number and then find its real
