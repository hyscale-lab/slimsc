Okay, so I've got this math problem here, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read it again.

There are 900 residents in Aimeville. Out of these, 195 own a diamond ring, 367 own a set of golf clubs, 562 own a garden spade. And every resident owns a bag of candy hearts. Wait, that's interesting because it says "each of the 900 residents owns a bag of candy hearts." So that means the number of people owning candy hearts is 900.

Then, it says there are 437 residents who own exactly two of these things, and 234 who own exactly three. The question is asking for the number of residents who own all four of these things.

Hmm, so I think this is a problem involving sets and Venn diagrams. Let me recall the principle of inclusion-exclusion because that's probably what I'll need here.

Inclusion-exclusion is used to calculate the union of multiple sets by adding up the sizes of the individual sets, subtracting the sizes of all possible two-set intersections, adding back in the sizes of all possible three-set intersections, and so on. But in this problem, we're given some specific numbers about exactly two and exactly three ownerships, which might be helpful.

Let me jot down what I know:

- Total residents, n = 900.

- Number owning diamond ring, D = 195.

- Number owning golf clubs, G = 367.

- Number owning garden spade, S = 562.

- Number owning candy hearts, C = 900 (since everyone owns this).

- Number owning exactly two things, exactly two = 437.

- Number owning exactly three things, exactly three = 234.

We need to find the number of people who own all four, which is n(D ∩ G ∩ S ∩ C).

Wait, but all residents own at least the candy hearts, so the candy hearts set is the universal set here. So, any intersection involving C is just the other set. For example, D ∩ C is just D because everyone owns C. Similarly, G ∩ C is G, and S ∩ C is S. Hmm, that might complicate things a bit, but maybe I can proceed.

Wait, but let's think about how the inclusion-exclusion principle applies here. The formula for four sets would be complex, but perhaps since C is universal, maybe some terms simplify.

Wait, maybe it's better to model it without C first, but since everyone owns C, all other items are subsets of C. So, perhaps it's better to model the problem as the union of D, G, S, but within the context of C, which is everyone. Hmm, perhaps not. Let me think.

Alternatively, maybe I can model the problem as three sets (D, G, S) with the fourth set (C) being the universal set. So, the problem reduces to the three sets D, G, S within the universal set C of size 900.

But, in that case, the counts for D, G, S are as given, and we need to find
