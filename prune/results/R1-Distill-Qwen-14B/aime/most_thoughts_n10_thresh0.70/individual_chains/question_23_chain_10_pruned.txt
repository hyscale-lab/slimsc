Okay, so I've got this math problem here. It says: Let A, B, C, D be points on the hyperbola x²/20 - y²/24 = 1 such that ABCD is a rhombus whose diagonals intersect at the origin. We need to find the greatest real number that is less than BD² for all such rhombi. Hmm, okay, let's break this down.

First, let's recall what a rhombus is. A rhombus is a quadrilateral with all sides equal in length, and its diagonals bisect each other at right angles. Wait, no, actually, the diagonals bisect each other and bisect the angles, but they don't necessarily have to be perpendicular unless it's a square. Wait, no, in a rhombus, the diagonals are not necessarily perpendicular? Wait, no, wait, correction: in a rhombus, the diagonals are perpendicular. Yes, that's right. So, in a rhombus, the diagonals are perpendicular bisectors of each other.

Given that the diagonals intersect at the origin, that means the origin is the midpoint of both diagonals. So, for points A, B, C, D, if we're considering ABCD as a rhombus, then the midpoints of AC and BD must be the origin. So, if A is (x, y), then C must be (-x, -y), right? Because the midpoint between A and C is ((x + (-x))/2, (y + (-y))/2) = (0, 0). Similarly, the midpoint between B and D is the origin.

Since ABCD is a rhombus, all sides are equal. So, AB = BC = CD = DA. But more importantly, since it's a rhombus, the diagonals are perpendicular. So, the diagonals AC and BD are perpendicular. So, the product of their slopes should be -1.

But wait, points A, B, C, D lie on the hyperbola x²/20 - y²/24 = 1. So, each coordinate satisfies that equation.

Let me try to parametrize the points. Let me consider points A and C as opposite vertices, and B and D as the other pair.

Since the diagonals intersect at the origin, and the origin is the midpoint, if I let point A be (x1, y1), then point C is (-x1, -y1). Similarly, if point B is (x2, y2), then point D is (-x2, -y2).

Now, since ABCD is a rhombus, all sides must be equal. So, the distance between A and B should be equal to the distance between B and C, and so on.

But maybe there's a better approach. Since the diagonals are perpendicular, the vectors AC and BD are perpendicular. Vector AC is from A to C, which is (-2x1, -2y1), and vector BD is from B to D, which is (-2x2, -2y2). So, their dot product should be zero.

Wait, but actually, vectors AC and BD are the diagonals. So, vector AC is from A to C, which is (-x1 - x1, -y1 - y1) = (-2x1, -2y1). Similarly, vector BD is (-2x2, -2y2). The dot product of AC and BD should be zero because the diagonals are perpendicular.

So, (-2x1)(-2x2) + (-2y1)(-2y2) = 0. Simplifying, 4x1x2 + 4y1y2 = 0. Divide both sides by 4: x1x2 + y1y2 = 0.

So, we have that x1x2 + y1y2 = 0.

Now, since A and B lie on the hyperbola, they must satisfy the equation x²/20 - y²/24 = 1.

So, for point A: (x1)^2 /20 - (y1)^2 /24 = 1.

Similarly for point B: (x2)^2 /20 - (y2)^2 /24 = 1.

Okay, so we have these two equations, plus the equation from the diagonals being perpendicular: x1x2 + y1y2 = 0.

Hmm, perhaps we can parametrize the points on the hyperbola. For hyperbola x²/a² - y²/b² = 1, a common parametrization is (a secθ, b tanθ). Alternatively, we can use hyperbolic functions: (a cosh t, b sinh t). Both parametrizations cover only one branch of the hyperbola, but maybe since the hyperbola is symmetric, we can handle both branches.

Alternatively, maybe we can
