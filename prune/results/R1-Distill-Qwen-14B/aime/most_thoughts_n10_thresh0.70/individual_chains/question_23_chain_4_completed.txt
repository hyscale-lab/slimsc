Okay, so I'm trying to solve this problem where we have a hyperbola given by the equation x²/20 - y²/24 = 1. There are four points on this hyperbola, A, B, C, and D, forming a rhombus ABCD. The diagonals of this rhombus intersect at the origin. We need to find the greatest real number that is less than BD² for all such rhombi. Hmm, okay, let me try to break this down.

First, I recall that a rhombus is a quadrilateral with all sides equal, and its diagonals bisect each other at right angles, but wait, actually, no, the diagonals bisect each other but they aren't necessarily perpendicular unless it's a square. Wait, no, in a rhombus, the diagonals are not equal but they do bisect each other at right angles. So, that's an important property.

Given that the diagonals intersect at the origin, which is the center of the hyperbola, that makes sense because the hyperbola is symmetric about the origin. So, points A, B, C, D are arranged such that the diagonals AC and BD intersect at the origin.

Since it's a rhombus, the diagonals bisect each other. So, if the origin is the midpoint, then for each point, the other end of the diagonal is the negative of that point. For example, if point A is (x, y), then point C would be (-x, -y).

Similarly, points B and D would be such that B is (p, q) and D is (-p, -q). So, all four points are (x,y), (-x,-y), (p,q), (-p,-q).

Now, these four points lie on the hyperbola, so plugging each into the equation:

For point A: x²/20 - y²/24 = 1

For point B: p²/20 - q²/24 = 1

Similarly, points C and D will satisfy the same equations because they're just negatives.

So, each of the four points lies on the hyperbola, meaning (x, y) and (p, q) are two distinct points on the hyperbola.

Now, the rhombus is formed by these four points. So, the sides are AB, BC, CD, DA.

But since it's a rhombus, all sides are equal in length. So, the distance between A and B should equal the distance between B and C, etc.

Let me write down the coordinates:

A = (x, y)

B = (p, q)

C = (-x, -y)

D = (-p, -q)

So, the diagonals are AC and BD. The diagonals intersect at the origin, as given.

Now, in a rhombus, the diagonals are not equal, but they bisect each other at right angles. So, the diagonals AC and BD are perpendicular to each other.

So, the vectors AC and BD are perpendicular. Let's find the vectors.

Vector AC goes from A to C: (-x - x, -y - y) = (-2x, -2y)

Similarly, vector BD goes from B to D: (-p - p, -q - q) = (-2p, -2q)

But actually, wait, in terms of direction, since AC is from (x, y) to (-x, -y), the vector is (-2x, -2y). Similarly for BD.

But wait, the diagonals themselves are the lines connecting A to C and B to D. So, the vectors along these diagonals are (-2x, -2y) and (-2p, -2q) respectively.

For these vectors to be perpendicular, their dot product should be zero.

So, (-2x)(-2p) + (-2y)(-2q) = 0

Which simplifies to 4xp + 4yq = 0

Divide both sides by 4: xp + yq = 0

So, that's a condition that must be satisfied.

Also, since ABCD is a rhombus, the sides must all be equal. Let's compute the distance between A and B, and between B and C.

Distance AB: sqrt[(p - x)^2 + (q - y)^2]

Distance BC: sqrt[(-x - p)^2 + (-y - q)^2]

Since AB = BC in a rhombus, their squares are equal:

(p - x)^2 + (q - y)^2 = (-x - p)^2 + (-y - q)^2

Let me expand both sides:

Left side: (p² - 2xp + x²) + (q² - 2yq + y²) = p² + x² + q² + y² - 2xp - 2yq

Right side: [(-x - p)^2] = (x + p)^2 = x² + 2xp + p²

Similarly, [(-y - q)^2] = (y + q)^2 = y² + 2yq + q²

So, right side total: x² + 2xp + p² + y² + 2yq + q²

Set left and right equal:

p² + x² + q² + y² - 2xp - 2yq = x² + 2xp + p² + y² + 2yq + q²

Simplify both sides by subtracting p² + x² + q² + y²:

-2xp - 2yq = 2xp + 2yq

Bring all terms to left:

-2xp - 2yq - 2xp - 2yq = 0

Combine like terms:

-4xp -4yq = 0

Divide both sides by -4:

xp + yq = 0

Wait, this is the same condition as before from the perpendicular diagonals! So, that's consistent.

So, the condition that the diagonals are perpendicular is equivalent to the sides being equal in the rhombus. So, that's good, it's one condition.

So, our main conditions are:

1. Points A(x, y), B(p, q), C(-x, -y), D(-p, -q) lie on the hyperbola x²/20 - y²/24 = 1.

2. xp + yq = 0.

We need to find the greatest real number less than BD² for all such rhombi.

BD is the length of diagonal BD. Let's compute BD².

Points B(p, q) and D(-p, -q). So, BD is the distance between (p, q) and (-p, -q).

Distance BD: sqrt[(-p - p)^2 + (-q - q)^2] = sqrt[(-2p)^2 + (-2q)^2] = sqrt[4p² + 4q²] = 2*sqrt(p² + q²)

So, BD² = (2*sqrt(p² + q²))² = 4(p² + q²)

So, our target is to find the infimum of BD², or rather, the greatest lower bound for BD² across all possible such rhombi. Because the problem asks for the greatest real number less than BD² for all such rhombi, that would be the infimum, I think. Wait, but it's the greatest number less than BD² for all rhombi, meaning that no matter which rhombus you choose, BD² will always be larger than this number. So, find the supremum of the lower bounds for BD², which is the infimum of BD².

Wait, no. Let me think. We have BD² can vary depending on the rhombus. The problem asks for the greatest number that is less than BD² for all rhombi. So, it's the infimum of BD² across all possible rhombi. Because for all rhombi, BD² is greater than or equal to some number, say m, and m is the greatest such number. So, m is the infimum of BD².

So, we need to find the minimum possible value of BD², which is 4(p² + q²). Since BD² depends on p and q, we need to find the minimal value of 4(p² + q²) given the constraints.

Constraints:

1. (x²)/20 - (y²)/24 = 1

2. (p²)/20 - (q²)/24 = 1

3. xp + yq = 0

So, four variables x, y, p, q, but with these three equations.

Hmm, how can we approach this? Maybe express variables in terms of each other.

Given that xp + yq = 0, perhaps we can relate p and q in terms of x and y, or vice versa.

From xp + yq = 0, we can write q = (-xp)/y, provided y ≠ 0. Similarly, p = (-yq)/x, provided x ≠ 0.

So, let me proceed.

Let me assume y ≠ 0, so q = (-xp)/y.

Then, point B is (p, q) = (p, (-xp)/y). Now, since B lies on the hyperbola, plugging into equation:

p²/20 - q²/24 = 1

Substitute q = (-xp)/y:

p²/20 - [ ( (-xp)/y )² ] /24 = 1

Simplify:

p²/20 - [ (x² p²)/(y²) ] /24 = 1

Factor out p²:

p² [ 1/20 - (x²)/(24 y²) ] = 1

Let me write this as:

p² [ (24 y² - 20 x²) / (20 * 24 y²) ) ] = 1

So,

p² = 1 / [ (24 y² - 20 x²) / (20 * 24 y²) ) ]

Which is:

p² = (20 * 24 y²) / (24 y² - 20 x² )

Similarly, from point A: x²/20 - y²/24 = 1

Let me denote this as equation (1):

x²/20 - y²/24 = 1

So, we can perhaps express x² in terms of y², or y² in terms of x².

From equation (1):

x² = 20(1 + y²/24 )

So, x² = 20 + (20 y²)/24 = 20 + (5 y²)/6

So, x² = 20 + (5 y²)/6.

Similarly,

y² = (24)(x²/20 - 1) = (24 x²)/20 - 24 = (6 x²)/5 - 24

So, expressions for x² and y² in terms of each other.

Now, going back to p²:

p² = (20 * 24 y²) / (24 y² - 20 x² )

Let me compute the denominator:

24 y² - 20 x² = 24 y² - 20 x²

But from x² =20 + (5 y²)/6,

20 x² = 20*(20 + (5 y²)/6 ) = 400 + (100 y²)/6 = 400 + (50 y²)/3

Similarly, 24 y² is just 24 y².

So, 24 y² - 20 x² =24 y² - [400 + (50 y²)/3 ]

= (24 y² - (50 y²)/3 ) - 400

= [ (72 y² -50 y²)/3 ] -400

= (22 y² /3 ) -400

So, denominator is (22 y² /3 ) -400.

Similarly, the numerator is 20*24 y² = 480 y².

So, p² = (480 y²) / ( (22 y² /3 ) -400 )

Simplify denominator:

(22 y² /3 -400 ) = (22 y² -1200)/3

So,

p² = (480 y²) / ( (22 y² -1200)/3 ) = (480 y² ) * (3)/(22 y² -1200 ) = (1440 y² ) / (22 y² -1200 )

So, p² = (1440 y² ) / (22 y² -1200 )

Similarly, since p² must be positive, denominator and numerator must have the same sign.

Numerator: 1440 y² is always non-negative, and since y² can't be zero (since point B is different from origin, I think), so numerator is positive.

So denominator must also be positive:

22 y² -1200 >0 => y² > 1200/22 ≈ 54.545

So, y² must be greater than about 54.545.

Similarly, let's express BD² in terms of y.

BD² =4(p² + q² )

We have q = (-xp)/y, so q² = (x² p² ) / y²

So, BD² =4 [ p² + (x² p² ) / y² ] =4 p² (1 + x² / y² )

From equation (1): x² /20 - y² /24 =1

Let me solve for x²: x² =20 + (5 y² ) /6

So, x² / y² = [20 + (5 y²)/6 ] / y² = 20 / y² +5/6

So, 1 +x² / y² =1 +20/y² +5/6= (6/6 +5/6) +20/y²= (11/6 ) + 20/y²

So, BD² =4 p² (11/6 +20/y² )

But we have p² expressed in terms of y²:

p² = (1440 y² ) / (22 y² -1200 )

So, substituting:

BD² =4 * [ (1440 y² ) / (22 y² -1200 ) ] * [ (11/6 ) +20/y² ]

Let me compute this expression step by step.

First, compute [ (11/6 ) +20/y² ]:

= (11/6 ) + (20/y² ) = (11 y² + 120 ) / (6 y² )

So, BD² becomes:

4 * [ (1440 y² ) / (22 y² -1200 ) ] * [ (11 y² +120 ) / (6 y² ) ]

Simplify:

4 * [1440 y² * (11 y² +120 ) ] / [ (22 y² -1200 ) *6 y² ]

Simplify numerator and denominator:

Numerator: 4 *1440 y² (11 y² +120 ) = 5760 y² (11 y² +120 )

Denominator: (22 y² -1200 ) *6 y² =6 y² (22 y² -1200 )

So,

BD²= [5760 y² (11 y² +120 ) ] / [6 y² (22 y² -1200 ) ]

Simplify terms:

5760 /6 = 960

y² cancels out.

So,

BD²= 960 (11 y² +120 ) / (22 y² -1200 )

Factor numerator and denominator:

Numerator: 11 y² +120 = 11(y² + 120/11 )

Denominator:22 y² -1200 =22(y² - 1200/22 )=22(y² - 54.545... )

But perhaps factor 11 from numerator and 22 from denominator:

Numerator: 11(y² + 120/11 )

Denominator:22(y² - 1200/22 )= 22(y² - 54.545 )

So,

BD²= 960 * [11(y² + 120/11 ) ] / [22(y² - 54.545 ) ]

Simplify 11/22 =1/2:

= 960 * (1/2) * (y² + 120/11 ) / (y² - 54.545 )

So,

BD²= 480 * (y² + 120/11 ) / (y² - 54.545 )

Let me compute 120/11 and 1200/22:

120/11 ≈10.909

54.545 is 1200/22.

So, 54.545 = 1200/22 = 54.545.

So, writing it as:

BD²=480*(y² + 120/11)/(y² - 1200/22 )

Let me denote z = y², so z > 1200/22 ≈54.545.

Then, BD²=480*(z + 120/11)/(z - 1200/22 )

Simplify the fractions:

120/11 = (120*2)/22=240/22

Similarly, 1200/22 remains as is.

So,

BD²=480*(z +240/22)/(z -1200/22 )

Factor numerator and denominator:

Numerator: z +240/22 = z + (240/22)

Denominator: z -1200/22

So, write as:

BD²=480*(z + (240/22 ))/(z - (1200/22 ))=480*(z + c )/(z - d ), where c=240/22, d=1200/22.

But 1200/22 =5*240/22, so d=5c.

So,

BD²=480*(z +c)/(z -5c )

Let me write this as:

BD²=480*(z +c )/(z -5c )

We can factor out c in numerator and denominator:

=480*c*(z/c +1 )/(c(z/c -5 ) )

Wait, maybe a better approach is to write it in terms of variable substitution.

Let me let t = z/c, so t = z/c.

Then,

BD²=480*(c t + c )/(c t -5 c )=480*c (t+1)/(c(t -5 ))=480*(t+1)/(t -5 )

Because c cancels out.

So, BD²=480*(t+1)/(t -5 )

Now, since z = y² >1200/22=54.545, and c=240/22≈10.909.

So, t = z/c > (1200/22)/(240/22)=1200/240=5.

So, t>5.

So, our variable t is greater than 5.

Thus, BD²=480*(t +1)/(t -5 ) where t>5.

We need to find the infimum of BD², which is the minimal value BD² can take as t approaches 5 from above and as t approaches infinity.

So, let's analyze the function f(t)=480*(t +1)/(t -5 ), t>5.

Compute the limit as t approaches 5+:

lim t→5+ f(t)= lim t→5+ [480*(t +1)/(t -5 ) ] = +infinity, since denominator approaches 0 from positive side.

As t approaches infinity:

lim t→∞ f(t)= lim t→∞ [480*(t +1)/(t -5 ) ]=480*(1 )=480.

So, as t increases, f(t) approaches 480.

Also, compute derivative to check if function is decreasing or increasing.

Compute f(t)=480*(t+1)/(t-5 )

f’(t)=480* [ (1)(t-5) - (t+1)(1) ] / (t-5 )² =480* [ (t-5 -t -1 ) ] / (t-5 )²=480*(-6)/(t-5 )²= -2880/(t-5 )².

Since t>5, denominator is positive, so f’(t) is negative.

Therefore, f(t) is decreasing for t>5.

So, the function decreases from +infinity to 480 as t increases from 5 to infinity.

Therefore, the minimal value of BD² is 480, approached as t approaches infinity.

But can BD² actually reach 480?

Wait, as t approaches infinity, BD² approaches 480.

But can t be infinity? No, because t is a real number greater than 5, but as t increases, BD² approaches 480 from above.

Therefore, BD² can be made arbitrarily close to 480, but never less than 480.

Hence, the infimum of BD² is 480.

But wait, the problem asks for the greatest real number less than BD² for all such rhombi.

So, since BD² can be as close to 480 as we like but is always greater than 480, the greatest number less than BD² for all rhombi is 480.

Wait, no, wait. Wait, I thought the infimum is 480, meaning BD² can be as close to 480 as possible but is always greater than 480. So, 480 is the minimal value, but since it's not achieved, it's the infimum.

Thus, the greatest number that is less than BD² for all rhombi is 480.

Therefore, the answer is 480.

But let me double-check.

Wait, so BD² approaches 480 as t approaches infinity, so for any epsilon>0, we can find a rhombus where BD² is less than 480 + epsilon. But since 480 is the lower bound, the greatest number less than BD² for all rhombi is 480.

Wait, but 480 is the infimum, so for all rhombi, BD² >=480, so the greatest number less than BD² for all rhombi is 480.

So, the answer is 480.

But let me just verify with an example.

Suppose t approaches infinity, so z = y² approaches infinity.

Then, from equation (1), x²=20 +5 y² /6.

So, as y² increases, x² increases as well.

Then, point B is (p, q)= (p, (-xp)/y )

From p²=1440 y²/(22 y² -1200 )

As y² approaches infinity, p²≈1440 y²/(22 y² )=1440/22≈65.4545.

So, p approaches sqrt(65.4545 )≈8.09.

Similarly, q = (-x p ) / y.

x²=20 +5 y²/6, so x≈sqrt(20 +5 y²/6 )

As y approaches infinity, x≈sqrt(5 y² /6 )= y*sqrt(5/6 )

So, q= (-x p )/ y≈ (- y sqrt(5/6 ) * p ) / y= - sqrt(5/6 ) * p≈ - sqrt(5/6 )*8.09≈-8.09*sqrt(5/6 )≈-8.09*0.9129≈-7.40.

So, point B is approaching (8.09, -7.40 ), and point D is (-8.09,7.40 )

So, BD is the distance between (8.09, -7.40 ) and (-8.09,7.40 )

Which is sqrt( (16.18)^2 + (14.8)^2 )= sqrt(261.8 + 219.04 )=sqrt(480.84 )≈21.92.

Which is approximately sqrt(480.84 )≈21.92.

So, BD²≈480.84.

Hmm, which is slightly above 480, as expected since BD² approaches 480 from above.

So, this suggests that 480 is indeed the infimum.

Therefore, the greatest real number less than BD² for all such rhombi is 480.

So, the answer is \boxed{480}


To solve the problem, we consider the hyperbola \(\frac{x^2}{20} - \frac{y^2}{24} = 1\) and the rhombus \(ABCD\) with diagonals intersecting at the origin. Points \(A\), \(B\), \(C\), and \(D\) lie on the hyperbola, and the diagonals \(AC\) and \(BD\) bisect each other at the origin. 

Given the properties of a rhombus, the diagonals are perpendicular, leading to the condition \(xp + yq = 0\) for points \(A(x, y)\) and \(B(p, q)\). The length of diagonal \(BD\) is given by \(BD^2 = 4(p^2 + q^2)\). 

Using the hyperbola equation and the condition \(xp + yq = 0\), we express \(BD^2\) in terms of \(y^2\). After simplification, we find that \(BD^2\) approaches 480 as \(y^2\) becomes very large. 

Thus, the greatest real number less than \(BD^2\) for all such rhombi is \(\boxed{480}\).
