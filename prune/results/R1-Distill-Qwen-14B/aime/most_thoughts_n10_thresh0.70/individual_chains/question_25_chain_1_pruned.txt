Okay, so I've got this math problem here about residents in Aimeville and the things they own. Let me try to break it down step by step. I'm going to take my time because I want to make sure I understand it correctly and don't make any mistakes.

First, let me read the problem again:

There are 900 residents in total. Out of these, 195 own a diamond ring, 367 own a set of golf clubs, and 562 own a garden spade. Additionally, every resident owns a bag of candy hearts. So, that's four items each resident might own: diamond ring (let's call this D), golf clubs (G), garden spade (S), and candy hearts (C). Wait, but the problem says each of the 900 owns a candy hearts bag, so that means all 900 have C. Hmm, that's an important point.

Now, the problem states that there are 437 residents who own exactly two of these things, and 234 who own exactly three. The question is asking for the number of residents who own all four of these items. Let's denote this number as x, which is the one we need to find.

So, let's think about how to model this. It sounds like a problem involving sets and their intersections. We can use the principle of inclusion-exclusion here. But since each item is a different thing, it's like four different sets, but all residents have at least C, since everyone owns a candy hearts bag.

Wait, actually, no. Wait, the problem says each of the 900 owns a bag of candy hearts. So, that means C is universal here; everyone has it. So, the total number of residents is 900, and all of them have C. So, the other three items (D, G, S) are optional, but C is a given for everyone.

Wait, no, actually, the problem says "each of the 900 residents owns a bag of candy hearts." So, that means that in addition to whatever else they might own, every resident has C. So, when considering the ownership of D, G, S, and C, C is always present.

Wait, but the problem also mentions that 195 own D, 367 own G, and 562
