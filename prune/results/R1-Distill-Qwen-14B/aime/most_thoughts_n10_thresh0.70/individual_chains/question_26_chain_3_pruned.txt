Okay, so I have this geometry problem here. Let me try to parse it step by step. 

We have triangle ABC inscribed in a circle ω. The tangents to ω at B and C intersect at point D. Then, the line AD intersects ω again at point P. We are given the lengths AB=5, BC=9, AC=10, and we need to find AP, which can be written as a fraction m/n where m and n are coprime. Then, we have to find m + n.

Alright, let me try to visualize this. So, ABC is a triangle with sides 5, 9, 10. The circle ω is the circumcircle of ABC. The tangents at B and C meet at D, which is the ex-pole or something related to the triangle. Then, drawing AD and seeing where it meets the circumcircle again at P.

I think the key here is to use properties of circles, tangents, and perhaps some power of a point. Since D is the intersection of the tangents at B and C, D is the ex-similicenter or something like that. Wait, actually, the point where two tangents meet is called the pole of BC, but I'm not sure.

Wait, more importantly, the power of point D with respect to ω can be expressed in terms of the tangent lengths. Since DB and DC are tangents from D to ω, so DB = DC. That's a useful property.

Also, AD is a secant that passes through P on ω, so by the power of a point, the power of D with respect to ω is equal to DP * DA. Alternatively, since D is outside the circle, the power is equal to DB² = DC².

Wait, so Power of D: DB² = DC² = DP * DA.

So, if I can find DB, then I can relate it to DP and DA, but DA is from D to A, so DA = DP + PA. Hmm, but I don't know DP or DA yet.

Alternatively, perhaps we can use inversion or other projective methods, but that might be complicated.

Alternatively, maybe using coordinate geometry? Given the sides, perhaps we can assign coordinates to the triangle and compute everything.

Let me try that approach. Let me assign coordinates to the triangle ABC such that point C is at the origin (0,0), point A is at (10,0), since AC=10. Then, point B is somewhere in the plane. We can find the coordinates of B using the given side lengths.

Given AB=5, BC=9, and AC=10.

So, coordinates:

Let’s set point C at (0,0), point A at (10,0). Point B is (x,y). Then, the distances:

From B to C: sqrt(x² + y²) = 9 → x² + y² = 81.

From B to A: sqrt( (x-10)^2 + y^2 ) = 5 → (x-10)^2 + y² = 25.

So, subtract the first equation from the second:

(x-10)^2 + y² - (x² + y²) = 25 - 81 → x² -20x +100 + y² -x² - y² = -56 → -20x +100 = -56 → -20x = -156 → x = 156/20 = 39/5 = 7.8.

So, x = 7.8 = 39/5. Then, from the first equation, x² + y² = 81 → (39/5)^2 + y² = 81.

Compute (39/5)^2: (1521/25). So, y² = 81 - 1521/25 = (2025/25 - 1521/25) = 504/25 → y = sqrt(504/25) = sqrt(504)/5. Simplify sqrt(504):

504 factors: 504 = 16*31.5? Wait, 504 ÷ 16 is 31.5. Hmm, actually, 504 = 16 * 31.5? Wait, no, 16 * 31.5 is 504. But 31.5 is not an integer. Wait, perhaps I should factor 504.

504 = 16 * 31.5 → no, wait, 504 ÷ 16 is 31.5, which is not integer, so perhaps try smaller factors.

504: 504 ÷ 2 = 252 → 252 ÷ 2=126 → 126 ÷ 2=63 → 63=7*9. So, 504=2^3 * 3^2 *7^1.

So, sqrt(504)=sqrt(2^3 *3^2 *7)=2^(1.5)*3*sqrt(7)=2*sqrt(2)*3*sqrt(7)=6*sqrt(14).

Wait, let me see: sqrt(504)=sqrt(16*31.5)=4*sqrt(31.5). Hmm, that doesn't seem helpful. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, y²=504/25, so y= sqrt(504)/5 = (sqrt(504)/5). Let me compute sqrt(504):

504 = 16*31.5 → but 31.5 isn't a perfect square. Alternatively, 504 = 36*14. So, sqrt(504)=sqrt(36*14)=6*sqrt(14). Yes, that's correct because 6^2=36, 36*14=504.

So, y=6*sqrt(14)/5.

Therefore, point B is at (39/5, 6√14/5).

So, coordinates are:

A: (10,0)
B: (39/5, 6√14/5)
C: (0,0)

Now, we need to find point D, which is the intersection of the tangents at B and C to ω.

But wait, point C is (0,0), so the tangent at C to ω. Wait, but ω is the circumcircle of ABC. So, to find the tangent at C, we need the equation of the tangent line at C.

Similarly, tangent at B.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to compute the equations of these two tangents and find their intersection point D.

So, to find the tangent at a point on a circle, we can use the fact that the tangent is perpendicular to the radius at that point.

So, first, let's find the circumcircle ω of triangle ABC.

Given that we have the coordinates of A, B, C, we can find the circumcircle's equation.

The circumcircle can be found by determining the perpendicular bisectors of two sides and finding their intersection.

Alternatively, using the general equation of a circle: x² + y² + Dx + Ey + F = 0.

Since points A, B, C lie on the circle, we can plug their coordinates into this equation to find D, E, F.

Let's write the equations:

For point C (0,0): 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + F = 0 → F=0.

For point A (10,0): 10² + 0 + 10D + 0 + F = 0 → 100 +10D + F=0. But F=0, so 100 +10D=0 → D= -10.

For point B (39/5, 6√14/5): (39/5)^2 + (6√14/5)^2 + D*(39/5) + E*(6√14/5) + F=0.

Compute each term:

(39/5)^2 = (1521/25)

(6√14/5)^2 = (36*14)/25 = 504/25

D= -10, so D*(39/5) = (-10)*(39/5) = (-78)

E*(6√14/5) = (6√14/5)*E

F=0

So, plugging into the equation:

1521/25 + 504/25 -78 + (6√14/5)*E = 0

Compute 1521 + 504 = 2025, so 2025/25 = 81.

So, 81 -78 + (6√14/5)*E = 0 → 3 + (6√14/5)*E=0 → (6√14/5)*E = -3 → E= (-3)*(5)/(6√14) = (-15)/(6√14) = (-5)/(2√14)

Rationalizing the denominator:

E= (-5)/(2√14) * (√14/√14) = (-5√14)/(28)

So, E= -5√14/28.

Therefore, the equation of the circle is x² + y² -10x - (5√14/28)y = 0.

Alternatively, we can write it in standard form by completing the squares.

Let me do that.

x² -10x + y² - (5√14/28)y = 0.

Complete the square for x:

x² -10x = (x -5)^2 -25.

Complete the square for y:

y² - (5√14/28)y = [y - (5√14)/(56)]^2 - [ (5√14/56)^2 ]

Compute [ (5√14/56)^2 ]: (25*14)/(
