Okay, so I'm trying to solve this math problem where I need to find the number of ways to place some chips on a 5x5 grid. The chips can be either white or black, and there are 25 of each. The conditions are that each cell can have at most one chip, all chips in the same row must be the same color, all chips in the same column must be the same color, and any additional chip would violate these conditions. Hmm, that's a bit to unpack, but I'll try to break it down.

First, let me understand the constraints. Each row can have only one color, and same with each column. So, if I decide that row 1 is white, then all chips in row 1 must be white. Similarly, if column 3 is black, all chips in column 3 must be black. But since each cell can have at most one chip, that means in a row, if it's white, I can place any number of white chips (from 0 to 5), but all must be in that row. Wait, no, actually, each cell can have at most one chip, but the color constraints are per row and per column. So, if a row is white, then each cell in that row can be either white or empty, but wait, no, the color of the chips in a row must all be the same. So, if a row is white, all the chips in that row must be white; same for black. So, each row is either all white, all black, or empty. Wait, no, because the problem says "all chips in the same row have the same color." So, if a row has any chips, they must all be the same color. But a row can also be empty, right? Because "at most one chip" per cell, but it's okay for a row to have none.

Wait, but the problem says "some of these chips," which means that the placement can't have all cells empty. Hmm. So, each row must either be all white, all black, or empty. Similarly, each column must be all white, all black, or empty. But the catch is that, once placed, adding any additional chip would violate the constraints. So, it's a maximal placement. So, the configuration is such that you can't add any more chips without violating the row or column color constraints.

Wait, so if I have a row that
