Okay, so I've got this problem about counting paths on an 8x8 grid. The paths go from the lower left corner to the upper right corner, and each path has a length of 16. I need to find how many such paths change direction exactly four times. Hmm, let me try to figure this out.

First, I remember that on a grid, moving from one corner to the opposite usually involves moving right and up. For an 8x8 grid, you have to move 8 steps to the right (let's say right is 'R') and 8 steps up ('U'). So the total path is a sequence of 16 moves, 8 R's and 8 U's.

The number of such paths without any restrictions is the binomial coefficient C(16,8) which is 12870. But that's the total number of paths. Now, the problem is to find the number of paths that change direction exactly four times. Hmm, okay, so what does changing direction mean here?

Well, in a grid path, you can either be moving right or up. So a change in direction occurs when you switch from moving right to up or from up to right. For example, if you go R, R, U, U, that's two changes: after the second R, you switch to U, and that's one change. Wait, actually, when you switch from R to U, that's one change. If you switch back to R, that's another, and so on.

Wait, so each time you switch direction, that's a change. So, for example, the path RRRUUU would have one change after the third step. Similarly, RURURU would have multiple changes. So, each time the direction alternates, it's a change.

But how does this relate to the number of times the path changes direction? If the path has exactly four changes, how does that break down?

Let me think. Each time you change direction, you're switching between moving right and up. So, if you have four changes, the path alternates between R and U four times. But wait, how does that translate into the number of segments in the path?

Each change corresponds to a new segment. So, the number of segments in the path is one more than the number of changes. For instance, a path with four changes has five segments. Each segment is a consecutive sequence of the same direction.

So, for four changes, the path is composed of five segments. These segments alternate between R and U. So, if the first segment is R, the next is U, then R, then U, then R. Or it could start with U, then R, etc.

Wait, but in an 8x8 grid, all paths must have the same number of R's and U's, which is eight each. So, each path has 8 R's and 8 U's, but arranged in segments.

So, if I have five segments, and the segments alternate between R and U, the number of segments for R's and U's will depend on whether the path starts with R or U.

Case 1: The path starts with R. Then the segments are R, U, R, U, R. So, three R segments and two U segments.

Case 2: The path starts with U. Similarly, the segments are U, R, U, R, U. Again, three U segments and two R segments.

But wait, the number of R's is 8, so in Case 1, three R segments sum to 8. Similarly, two U segments sum to 8.

So, for each case, I can model this as a composition of 8 into either three parts (for R's) and two parts (for U's), or vice versa.

Wait, composition here meaning the number of ways to write 8 as the sum of a certain number of positive integers, where each integer represents the length of a segment.

So, for Case 1, starting with R: we have three R segments and two U segments, each of positive integer lengths.
