Okay, let's see. I have this problem about residents in Aimeville and the things they own. Hmm. So, the total number of residents is 900. Each of them owns a bag of candy hearts, which is one thing. Then there are three other items: diamond rings, golf clubs, and garden spades. Some own exactly two of these, some own exactly three, and I need to find how many own all four.

Alright, let me try to structure this. So, the four items are:

1. Diamond ring (let's call this D)
2. Golf clubs (G)
3. Garden spade (S)
4. Candy hearts (C), which everyone has.

So, each resident has at least C. Now, the problem states that 195 own a diamond ring, 367 own golf clubs, 562 own a garden spade, and all own C, which is 900 people.

Wait, but then it says that 437 own exactly two of these things, and 234 own exactly three. So, I think I need to use the principle of inclusion-exclusion here. But I'm a bit confused about how to apply it because there are four sets now.

Let me recall the inclusion-exclusion principle for four sets. The formula is:

Total = |D ∪ G ∪ S ∪ C| = |D| + |G| + |S| + |C| - |D∩G| - |D∩S| - |D∩C| - |G∩S| - |G∩C| - |S∩C| + |D∩G∩S| + |D∩G∩C| + |D∩S∩C| + |G∩S∩C| - |D∩G∩S∩C|

But wait, the problem is that in this case, everyone owns C, so all intersections involving C are just the other sets. For example, D∩C is just D, because everyone has C. Similarly, G∩C is G, and S∩C is S. So, maybe this simplifies the formula?

Wait, let me think. If C is universal (everyone has it), then the union D ∪ G ∪ S ∪ C is just the same as D ∪ G ∪ S. Because C is already included in the union.

So, |D ∪ G ∪ S| = |D| + |G| + |S| - |D∩G| - |D∩S| - |G∩S| + |D∩G∩S|

But in our case, the total number of people is 900, and each has C. So, the total is 900, but how does that relate to the union?

Wait, no. Since everyone has C, the union D ∪ G ∪ S is the number of people who have at least one of D, G, or S. But since everyone has C, the entire population is 900. So, |D ∪ G ∪ S| would be equal to the number of people who have at least one of D, G, or S, but since some people might not have any of those.

Wait, no,
