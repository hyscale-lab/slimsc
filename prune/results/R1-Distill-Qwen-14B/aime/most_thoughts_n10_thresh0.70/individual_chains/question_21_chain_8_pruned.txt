Okay, so I have this problem here about b-eautiful numbers. Let me try to understand what it's asking. So, a positive integer n is called b-eautiful if two conditions are met. First, when you express n in base b, it has exactly two digits. Second, the sum of these two digits equals the square root of n. 

The example given is 81, which is 13-eautiful because in base 13, 81 is written as 63 (since 6*13 + 3 = 81), and 6 + 3 = 9, which is the square root of 81. So, that makes sense. 

The question is asking for the least integer b (where b is at least 2) such that there are more than ten b-eautiful integers. So, I need to find the smallest base b where the number of b-eautiful numbers is more than ten.

Let me break this down. First, let's represent n in base b. If n has exactly two digits in base b, then n can be written as n = a * b + c, where a and c are digits in base b. That means a can range from 1 to b-1 (since it's the leading digit and can't be zero), and c can range from 0 to b-1.

The second condition is that the sum of the digits a + c equals the square root of n. So, sqrt(n) = a + c. Squaring both sides, we get n = (a + c)^2.

But wait, n is also equal to a * b + c. So, putting it together:
a * b + c = (a + c)^2.

So, the equation we have is:
a * b + c = (a + c)^2.

Let me rearrange this equation to solve for b. Let's subtract a * b and c from both sides to see what we get:
0 = (a + c)^2 - a * b - c.

Let me expand the right side:
(a + c)^2 = a^2 + 2ac + c^2.

So,
a^2 + 2ac + c^2 - a * b - c = 0.

Hmm, maybe I can solve for b here. Let me rearrange terms:
a * b = a^2 + 2ac + c^2 - c.

So,
b = (a^2 + 2ac + c^2 - c) / a.

Simplify that:
b = (a^2 + 2ac + c^2 - c) / a = a + 2c + (c^2 - c)/a.

Since b must be an integer, the expression (c^2 - c)/a must also be an integer. Because a and c are digits in base b, a is at least 1 and at most b-1, and c is between 0 and b-1. 

Wait, but since a and c are digits, they are positive integers with a ≥ 1 and c ≥ 0. Also, since (c^2 - c) must be divisible by a, perhaps I can think of this as a condition that for given a and c, this must hold.

Alternatively, maybe I can rearrange the equation differently to make it more manageable. Let's see:

From n = a * b + c = (a + c)^2.

So, we can write:
a * b = (a + c)^2 - c.

Then,
b = [ (a + c)^2 - c ] / a.

So, since b must be an integer, [ (a + c)^2 - c ] must be divisible by a.

Let me denote s = a + c, so s = sqrt(n). Then, n = s^2. Also, n = a * b + c. So, s^2 = a * b +
