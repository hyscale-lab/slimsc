Okay, so I have this problem: I need to find the largest possible real part of the expression (75 + 117i)z + (96 + 144i)/z, where z is a complex number with |z| = 4. Hmm, okay. Let me think about how to approach this.

First, I know that z is a complex number on the circle with radius 4. So, I can represent z as 4e^{iθ}, where θ is the argument of z. That might make things easier because then I can express everything in terms of θ and use trigonometric identities.

So, let me write z as 4e^{iθ}. Then, 1/z would be (1/4)e^{-iθ}, since the magnitude of 1/z is 1/|z| = 1/4 and the argument is -θ. That makes sense.

Now, substitute z and 1/z into the expression:

(75 + 117i) * 4e^{iθ} + (96 + 144i) * (1/4)e^{-iθ}.

Let me compute each part separately.

First term: (75 + 117i) * 4e^{iθ}.

Calculating the scalar coefficients:
75 * 4 = 300,
117 * 4 = 468.

So, the first term is (300 + 468i) e^{iθ}.

Second term: (96 + 144i) * (1/4) e^{-iθ}.

Calculating the scalar coefficients:
96 / 4 = 24,
144 / 4 = 36.

So, the second term is (24 + 36i) e^{-iθ}.

Now, the entire expression is:

(300 + 468i)e^{iθ} + (24 + 36i)e^{-iθ}.

I need to find the real part of this expression. Let me denote the first term as A and the second as B for simplicity.

Real part of A plus real part of B.

I remember that for a complex number in the form (a + bi)e^{iθ}, the real part is a cosθ - b sinθ. Wait, let me recall Euler's formula: e^{iθ} = cosθ + isinθ. So, multiplying by (a + bi):

(a + bi)(cosθ + isinθ) = a cosθ + a i sinθ + bi cosθ + b i^2 sinθ.

Simplify: a cosθ - b sinθ + i(a sinθ + b cosθ). So, the real part is a cosθ - b sinθ.

Similarly, for (a + bi)e^{-iθ}, the real part would be a cosθ + b sinθ, because e^{-iθ} = cosθ - isinθ. So, multiplying by (a + bi):

(a + bi)(cosθ - i sinθ) = a cosθ - a i sinθ + bi cosθ - b i^2 sinθ.

Simplify: a cosθ + b sinθ + i(-a sinθ + b cosθ). So, the real part is a cosθ + b sinθ.

So, applying this:

Real part of A: (300) cosθ - (468) sinθ.
Real part of B: (24) cosθ + (36) sinθ.

So, total real part is [300 cosθ - 468 sinθ] + [24 cosθ + 36 sinθ].

Combine like terms:

(300 + 24) cosθ + (-468 + 36) sinθ.

Which is 324 cosθ - 432 sinθ.

So, the expression we need to maximize is 324 cosθ - 432 sinθ.

Hmm, okay. Now, I have an expression of the form M cosθ + N sinθ, which can be rewritten as R cos(θ + φ), where R is sqrt(M² + N²), and φ is some angle. Alternatively, it can also be written as R sin(θ + something), but cosine might be easier here.

Wait, the expression is 324 cosθ - 432 sinθ. So, it's M cosθ + N sinθ, but N is negative. So, maybe M = 324, N = -432.

Wait, let me think again. The standard form is A cosθ + B sinθ, which can be written as R cos(θ - φ), where R = sqrt(A² + B²), and φ = arctan(B/A). But in our case, it's 324 cosθ - 432 sinθ, which is A cosθ + B sinθ with B negative.

So, let me compute R: sqrt(324² + (-432)²).

Compute 324 squared: 324 * 324. Let me compute that.

324²: 300² = 90000, 24² = 576, and the cross term 2*300*24 = 14400. So, (300 + 24)^2 = 90000 + 14400 + 576 = 90000 + 14400 is 104400, plus 576 is 104,976.

Similarly, 432 squared: 432 is 400 + 32, so (400 + 32)^2 = 160000 + 2*400*32 + 32². 2*400*32 = 25600, 32²=1024. So, 160000 + 25600 = 185600, plus 1024 is 186,624.

So, R = sqrt(104976 + 186624) = sqrt(291600). Let me compute sqrt(291600). Hmm, 540² is 291600 because 500²=250000, 40²=1600, and 2*500*40=40,000. So, (500+40)^2=500² + 2*500*40 +40²=250000 +40000 +1600=291,600. So, R=540.

So, the expression is 540 cos(θ + φ), where φ is some angle such that cosφ = 324 / 540 and sinφ = 432 / 540, but wait, not quite. Because in the expression 324 cosθ - 432 sinθ, it's equivalent to R cos(θ + φ), where R=540, and:

cosφ = 324 / R = 324 / 540 = 0.6,
sinφ = 432 / R = 432 / 540 = 0.8.

Wait, wait a second. Let me check that. Because in the standard form, A cosθ + B sinθ = R cos(θ - φ), where R = sqrt(A² + B²), cosφ = A/R, sinφ = B/R.

But in our case, the expression is A cosθ + B sinθ, with A=324 and B=-432.

So, perhaps the formula is:

A cosθ + B sinθ = R cos(θ - φ),

where R = sqrt(A² + B²),

cosφ = A/R,

sinφ = B/R.

So, in our case, R is 540, cosφ = 324/540 = 0.6, sinφ = (-432)/540 = -0.8.

Wait, but that would imply φ is in the fourth quadrant because cosφ is positive and sinφ is negative.

Alternatively, we can write it as 540 cos(θ + φ'), where φ' is the angle such that cosφ' = 324/540 and sinφ' = 432/540. But in this case, since B is negative, it might be better to represent it as a phase shift with a negative sine.

Alternatively, perhaps I can write 324 cosθ - 432 sinθ = 540 cos(θ + φ), where φ is such that cosφ = 324/540 and sinφ = 432/540. But wait, if I use that, then 324 cosθ - 432 sinθ = 540 [ (324/540) cosθ - (432/540) sinθ ] = 540 [ cosφ cosθ - sinφ sinθ ] = 540 cos(θ + φ), since cos(θ + φ) = cosθ cosφ - sinθ sinφ.

Yes, that works. So, in that case, cosφ = 324/540 = 0.6, sinφ = 432/540 = 0.8. So, φ is arccos(0.6), which is approximately 53.13 degrees, but since sinφ is positive, it's in the first quadrant.

Wait, but in our expression, the coefficient of sinθ is negative. So, wait, wait. Let
