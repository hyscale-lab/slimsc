Okay, so I'm trying to solve this geometry problem about a tetrahedron. Let me read it again to make sure I understand.

We have a tetrahedron ABCD with specific edge lengths: AB and CD are both √41, AC and BD are √80, and BC and AD are √89. There's a point I inside the tetrahedron such that its distances to each of the four faces are all equal. We need to find this distance, which is given in the form m√n / p, where m, n, p are positive integers, m and p are coprime, and n is square-free. Then, we have to find m + n + p.

Hmm, okay. So, this point I is called the incenter of the tetrahedron, right? Just like the incenter in a triangle is the point equidistant from all sides, here it's equidistant from all four faces. The distance from this incenter to each face is the inradius.

Our goal is to find this inradius. To do that, I remember that the formula for the inradius r of a tetrahedron is similar to that in a triangle, where r = 3V / S, where V is the volume, and S is the total surface area. Wait, no, in 3D, the formula is r = 3V / A, where A is the total surface area. Because in 2D, area is base times height, so in 3D, volume is base area times height, so the inradius would be 3 times volume divided by the sum of the areas of all faces.

So, yes, r = 3V / A. So, I need to compute the volume V of the tetrahedron and the total surface area A.

But first, how do I compute the volume? I know that for a tetrahedron with given edge lengths, it's not straightforward unless it's regular or has some symmetry. Wait, this tetrahedron isn't regular because the edges are of different lengths, but it does have some symmetry because the opposite edges are equal: AB=CD, AC=BD, BC=AD. So, this is called an isosceles tetrahedron or a disphenoid. I remember that in such tetrahedrons, opposite edges are equal, and they have some nice properties.

In a disphenoid, all four faces are congruent triangles. Wait, is that true? Let me think. If all opposite edges are equal, then each face has two edges of one pair and two edges of another pair. Wait, no, each face is a triangle with edges, say, AB, AC, BC. But AB is √41, AC is √80, BC is √89. Similarly, the other faces will also have edges of the same lengths. So, each face is a triangle with sides √41, √80, and √89. Wait, that's the same for all four faces. So, actually, all four faces are congruent triangles.

Wow, that's a key point. So, each face is congruent, so their areas are equal
