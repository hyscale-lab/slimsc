Okay, so I have this problem here: I need to find the largest possible real part of the expression (75 + 117i)z + (96 + 144i)/z, where z is a complex number with |z| = 4. Hmm, that sounds a bit tricky, but I'll try to break it down step by step.

First, let's understand what's given. z is a complex number, and its magnitude is 4. So, z can be written in the form z = 4e^{iθ}, where θ is the argument of z. That's because any complex number with magnitude r can be expressed as r times e^{iθ}. So, maybe I can express z in this exponential form to make things easier.

Wait, actually, another way to represent z is as 4 times e^{iθ}, but alternatively, z can also be written as a + bi, where a and b are real numbers such that a² + b² = 16, since |z|² = 16. So, either way, I can approach the problem using either rectangular form or polar form. Maybe using exponential form will make it easier with the modulus.

But the expression involves both z and 1/z. Since |z| = 4, then |1/z| = 1/4. So, 1/z can also be written as (1/4)e^{-iθ}, because if z = 4e^{iθ}, then 1/z = (1/4)e^{-iθ}. So, that might simplify things a bit.

So, let me rewrite the expression:

(75 + 117i)z + (96 + 144i)/z

Substituting z = 4e^{iθ} and 1/z = (1/4)e^{-iθ}, the expression becomes:

(75 + 117i)(4e^{iθ}) + (96 + 144i)(1/4)e^{-iθ}

Let me compute each term separately.

First term: (75 + 117i)(4e^{iθ}) = 4*(75 + 117i)*e^{iθ}

Compute 4*(75 + 117i): 4*75 = 300, 4*117 = 468, so that's 300 + 468i.

So, first term is (300 + 468i)e^{iθ}

Second term: (96 + 144i)*(1/4)e^{-iθ} = (96/4 + 144/4)i e^{-iθ} = (24 + 36i)e^{-iθ}

So, the entire expression becomes:

(300 + 468i)e^{iθ} + (24 + 36i)e^{-iθ}

Now, I can use Euler's formula to expand these exponentials. Remember, e^{iθ} = cosθ + i sinθ, and e^{-iθ} = cosθ - i sinθ.

So, let's expand each term:

First term expansion:

(300 + 468i)(cosθ + i sinθ) = 300 cosθ + 300 i sinθ + 468i cosθ + 468i² sinθ

But i² is -1, so that's 300 cosθ + 300 i sinθ + 468i cosθ - 468 sinθ

Combine like terms:

Real parts: 300 cosθ - 468 sinθ

Imaginary parts: 300 sinθ + 468 cosθ

So, first term is (300 cosθ - 468 sinθ) + i(300 sinθ + 468 cosθ)

Second term expansion:

(24 + 36i)(cosθ - i sinθ) = 24 cosθ - 24i sinθ + 36i cosθ - 36i² sinθ

Again, i² is -1, so:

24 cosθ - 24i sinθ + 36i cosθ + 36 sinθ

Combine like terms:

Real parts: 24 cosθ + 36 sinθ

Imaginary parts: (-24 sinθ + 36 cosθ)i

So, second term is (24 cosθ + 36 sinθ) + i(-24 sinθ + 36 cosθ)

Now, add the first and second terms together.

Adding the real parts:

(300 cosθ - 468 sinθ) + (24 cosθ + 36 sinθ) = (300 + 24) cosθ + (-468 + 36) sinθ = 324 cosθ - 432 sinθ

Adding the imaginary parts:

(300 sinθ + 468 cosθ) + (-24 sinθ + 36 cosθ) = (300 -24) sinθ + (468 + 36) cosθ = 276 sinθ + 504 cosθ

So, the entire expression is equal to (324 cosθ - 432 sinθ) + i(276 sinθ + 504 cosθ)

But we are only interested in the real part of this expression. So, the real part is 324 cosθ - 432 sinθ.

Our goal is to find the maximum value of this real part, which is a function of θ.

So, the real part is R(θ) = 324 cosθ - 432 sinθ.

To find the maximum value of R(θ), we can treat this as a single sinusoidal function.

Recall that an expression of the form A cosθ + B sinθ can be rewritten as C cos(θ + φ), where C = sqrt(A² + B²), and φ is some phase shift. The maximum value of this expression is then C.

But in our case, R(θ) is 324 cosθ - 432 sinθ, which is similar but with a negative sign. So, let's compute the amplitude (or the maximum value).

Compute the amplitude C:

C = sqrt( (324)^2 + (-432)^2 )

Compute 324 squared:

324^2: Let me compute 320^2 = 102400, 4^2 = 16, and cross terms: 2*320*4 = 2560.

So, (320 + 4)^2 = 320² + 2*320*4 + 4² = 102400 + 2560 + 16 = 104,976.

Wait, wait, that's 324 squared: 324 = 18^2 * ( (18)^2 )? Wait, no, 18*18=324, so 324^2 = (18^2)^2 = 18^4. But maybe I should just multiply 324 * 324.

Alternatively, 324 * 300 = 97,200; 324 * 24=7,776. So, 97,200 +7,776=104,976. Yes, that's correct.

Similarly, 432^2: 400^2=160,000, 32^2=1,024, and cross term 2*400*32=25,600.

So, (400 +32)^2 = 400² + 2*400*32 +32² = 160,000 +25,600 +1,024=186,624.

But since in our case B is -432, but in the formula, we square B, so the sign doesn't matter. So, C = sqrt(104,976 + 186,624) = sqrt(291,600).

Compute sqrt(291,600). Let's see, 500²=250,000, 540²=291,600. Because 540*540: 500*500=250,000, 500*40=20,000, 40*500=20,000, 40*40=1,600. So, total: 250,000 + 20,000 +20,000 +1,600=291,600. So, yes, sqrt(291,600)=540.

Therefore, the maximum value of R(θ) is 540. So, the largest possible real part is 540.

Wait, but let me double-check. I might have messed up the signs somewhere. Let me see.

So, R(θ) is 324 cosθ - 432 sinθ. So, when I compute C, it's sqrt(324² + (-432)^2) = sqrt(104,976 + 186,624)=sqrt(291,600)=540. So, yes, that part is correct.

Alternatively, sometimes when dealing with R(θ)=A cosθ + B sinθ, the maximum is sqrt(A² + B²). So, that's consistent.

But wait, wait, in our case, R(θ)=324 cosθ -432 sinθ. So, if I write this as R(θ) = C cos(θ + φ), then the maximum value is indeed C, which is 540.

So, the maximum real part is 540.

Hmm, but wait a second. Let me think again. Because in the expression, we have two terms: (75 +117i)z and (96 + 144i)/z. Maybe there's another way to approach this problem, perhaps by considering z and 1/z as conjugates or something?

Wait, since |z|=4, then 1/z is the conjugate of z divided by |
