Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the radius squared of the smallest sphere that can contain any rectangular box from the set B. Each box in B has a surface area of 54 and a volume of 23. Then, I need to express r squared as a fraction p/q where p and q are coprime, and find p + q. Hmm, that sounds a bit involved, but let's break it down step by step.

First, let's recall the formulas for the surface area and volume of a rectangular box. The surface area S of a box with length x, width y, and height z is given by:

S = 2(xy + yz + xz)

And the volume V is:

V = xyz

Given that S = 54 and V = 23, so:

2(xy + yz + xz) = 54 → xy + yz + xz = 27

and

xyz = 23

I need to find the minimal sphere that can contain such a box. The sphere's diameter will be the space diagonal of the box because the sphere must touch the farthest corners of the box. So, the space diagonal d is given by:

d = sqrt(x² + y² + z²)

Therefore, the radius r of the sphere is half of that:

r = d / 2 = (sqrt(x² + y² + z²)) / 2

So, we need to minimize r, which is equivalent to minimizing d², since sqrt is a monotonically increasing function. Therefore, we can instead minimize x² + y² + z².

So, our goal is to find the minimum value of x² + y² + z² given the constraints:

1. xy + yz + xz = 27
2. xyz = 23

Hmm, this seems like an optimization problem with constraints. Maybe I can use Lagrange multipliers or some inequality like AM ≥ GM or others. Let me think.

Wait, maybe I can express x² + y² + z² in terms of the given constraints. Let me recall that:

(x + y + z)² = x² + y² + z² + 2(xy + yz + xz)

So, rearranging, we get:

x² + y² + z² = (x + y + z)² - 2(xy + yz + xz)

We know that xy + yz + xz = 27, so:

x² + y² + z² = (x + y + z)² - 54

So, minimizing x² + y² + z² is equivalent to minimizing (x + y + z)², which is the same as minimizing x + y + z, since x, y, z are positive.

Therefore, our goal is to minimize x + y + z, given that:

xy + yz + xz = 27

and

xyz = 23

Hmm, sounds tricky. I know that for positive numbers, the AM ≥ GM inequality could be useful. Let's think about variables x, y, z.

Alternatively, another approach is to consider that when we have symmetric constraints, sometimes the minimal value occurs when all variables are equal, but in this case, the volume is 23, which is not a perfect cube, so they can't all be equal. So, maybe a different approach.

Wait, perhaps we can use Lagrange multipliers. Let me set up the function to minimize.

Let me denote S = x + y + z, which we need to minimize.

Constraints:

1. xy + yz + xz = 27
2. xyz = 23

We can set up the Lagrangian:

L = x + y + z + λ(27 - xy - yz - xz) + μ(23 - xyz)

Wait, actually, that's not quite right. The constraints are equalities, so the Lagrangian should be:

L = x + y + z + λ(27 - xy - yz - xz) + μ(23 - xyz)

Wait, but actually, we're trying to minimize S = x + y + z subject to two constraints. So, actually, the Lagrangian should be:

L = x + y + z + λ(27 - (xy + yz + xz)) + μ(23 - xyz)

Then, we take partial derivatives with respect to x, y, z, λ, μ and set them equal to zero.

Compute the partial derivatives:

∂L/∂x = 1 - λ(y + z) - μ(yz) = 0

Similarly,

∂L/∂y = 1 - λ(x + z) - μ(x
