Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the number of triples of nonnegative integers (a, b, c) that satisfy two conditions: a + b + c = 300 and a²b + a²c + b²a + b²c + c²a + c²b = 6,000,000. Hmm, that seems a bit complex, but let me try to break it down.

First, let's write down the given equations:

1. a + b + c = 300
2. a²b + a²c + b²a + b²c + c²a + c²b = 6,000,000

Hmm, I notice that the second equation looks symmetric in a, b, c. Maybe I can factor it somehow or express it in terms of other expressions we know, like (a + b + c), ab + bc + ca, or something similar.

Let me see: the second equation is a²b + a²c + b²a + b²c + c²a + c²b. Let me factor out terms. Let's group them:

a²b + a²c = a²(b + c)
Similarly, b²a + b²c = b²(a + c)
And c²a + c²b = c²(a + b)

So the entire expression becomes:

a²(b + c) + b²(a + c) + c²(a + b)

Now, since a + b + c = 300, I can replace (b + c) with (300 - a), right? Because a + b + c = 300, so b + c = 300 - a.

Similarly, (a + c) = 300 - b, and (a + b) = 300 - c.

So substituting these in, the second equation becomes:

a²(300 - a) + b²(300 - b) + c²(300 - c) = 6,000,000

Hmm, that might be a bit easier to work with. Let me write that as:

300a² - a³ + 300b² - b³ + 300c² - c³ = 6,000,000

Which can be rearranged as:

300(a² + b² + c²) - (a³ + b³ + c³) = 6,000,000

Okay, so now I have this equation. Let me denote S = a + b + c = 300, Q = ab + bc + ca, and P = abc. Maybe I can express a² + b² + c² and a³ + b³ + c³ in terms of S, Q, and P.

I remember that a² + b² + c² = S² - 2Q. That's a standard identity. So substituting S=300, that becomes 300² - 2Q = 90000 - 2Q.

Similarly, for a³ + b³ + c³, I remember that a³ + b³ + c³ = S³ - 3S Q + 3P. Let me verify that: yes, the formula is a³ + b³ + c³ = (a + b + c)^3 - 3(a + b + c)(ab + bc + ca) + 3abc. So that would be 300³ - 3*300*Q + 3P.

So putting it all together, our second equation becomes:

300(a² + b² + c²) - (a³ + b³ + c³) = 300*(90000 - 2Q) - (300³ - 3*300*Q + 3P)

Let me compute each term step by step.

First, compute 300*(90000 - 2Q):

300*90000 = 27,000,000
300*(-2Q) = -600 Q
So this part is 27,000,000 - 600 Q.

Next, compute (300³ - 3*300*Q + 3P):

300³ is 27,000,000
3*300*Q is 900 Q
So, 27,000,000 - 900 Q + 3P.

So putting it all together, the equation is:

[27,000,000 - 600 Q] - [27,000,000 - 900 Q + 3P] = 6,000,000

Let me compute that:

27,000,000 - 600 Q - 27,000,000 + 900 Q - 3P = 6,000,000

Simplify term by term:

27,000,000 - 27,000,000 = 0
-600 Q + 900 Q = 300 Q
So we have 300 Q - 3P = 6,000,000.

So, 300 Q - 3P = 6,000,000.

I can divide both sides by 3 to simplify:

100 Q - P = 2,000,000.

So now, the equation reduces to:

P = 100 Q - 2,000,000.

Hmm, so now I have relationships between S, Q, and P. Let me recap:

S = a + b + c = 300

We also have P = 100 Q - 2,000,000.

But I also know that for three variables, the elementary symmetric sums are S, Q, P, and they are related through the characteristic equation of the roots a, b, c.

Specifically, if a, b, c are roots of the cubic equation x³ - S x² + Q x - P = 0.

So, the equation is x³ - 300 x² + Q x - P = 0.

But since P = 100 Q - 2,000,000, we can substitute that in:

x³ - 300 x² + Q x - (100 Q - 2,000,000) = 0.

Simplify:

x³ - 300 x² + Q x - 100 Q + 2,000,000 = 0.

Hmm, maybe I can factor this equation or find a way to express Q in terms of x or something. Alternatively, perhaps I can rearrange terms:

x³ - 300 x² + (Q x - 100 Q) + 2,000,000 = 0.

Factor Q out of the middle terms:

x³ - 300 x² + Q (x - 100) + 2,000,000 = 0.

That's interesting. Hmm, so maybe if I can find a way to express this in terms of (x - 100), but I'm not sure yet.

Alternatively, perhaps I can think of a, b, c as variables such that each of them is small compared to 300, but given that a + b + c = 300, maybe they're all around 100.

Wait, let me think about the constraints. Since a, b, c are nonnegative integers, and their sum is 300, each of them can be between 0 and 300.

Looking back at the second equation, which after substitution became 100 Q - P = 2,000,000.

But Q is ab + bc + ca, and P is abc. So, 100(ab + bc + ca) - abc = 2,000,000.

Hmm, that's an equation we need to solve for nonnegative integers a, b, c with a + b + c = 300.

I wonder if there's a clever substitution or perhaps assuming two variables are equal, but I don't know. Alternatively, maybe I can consider the equation 100Q - P = 2e6, and see if I can find possible Q and P that satisfy this.

But perhaps I can consider variables x = a, y = b, z = c.

Given that x + y + z = 300, we have:

100(xy + yz + zx) - xyz = 2,000,000.

Hmm, maybe I can factor this equation. Let me see if that's possible.

Wait, perhaps I can write this as:

xyz - 100(xy + yz + zx) + 2,000,000 = 0.

Hmm, that's a cubic in three variables. Maybe it's difficult to factor. Alternatively, perhaps I can set variables
