Okay, so I've got this math problem here, and I need to find the product xy where x and y are both greater than 1. The equations given are log base x of y^x equals 10, and log base y of x^{4y} also equals 10. Hmm, logarithms can sometimes be tricky, but let me try to break this down step by step.

First, I remember that log_b(a) = c is equivalent to b^c = a. Maybe I can use this property to rewrite both equations in exponential form. Let me try that.

Starting with the first equation: log_x(y^x) = 10. Using the property, this should mean that x^10 = y^x. Okay, so x to the 10th power equals y to the x power. I'll write that down as equation (1): x^10 = y^x.

Now, the second equation: log_y(x^{4y}) = 10. Applying the same property, this should mean that y^10 = x^{4y}. Let me note this as equation (2): y^10 = x^{4y}.

So now I have two equations:

1. x^10 = y^x
2. y^10 = x^{4y}

I need to find x and y such that both these equations hold true. Since both x and y are greater than 1, they are positive real numbers, which is good because logarithms are defined for positive numbers.

Hmm, perhaps I can express y in terms of x from equation (1) and substitute into equation (2). Let me see.

From equation (1): x^10 = y^x. If I take both sides to the power of (1/x), I get (x^10)^(1/x) = y. Simplifying the left side, that's x^(10/x) = y. So y = x^(10/x). Let me write that as y = x^{10/x}.

Now substitute this expression for y into equation (2). So equation (2) becomes: (x^{10/x})^10 = x^{4*(x^{10/x})}.

Wait, let me make sure I substitute correctly. The left side is y^10, which is (x^{10/x})^10. The right side is x^{4y}, which is x^{4*(x^{10/x})}.

So, left side: (x^{10/x})^10. Simplify exponents: 10/x multiplied by 10 gives 100/x. So left side is x^{100/x}.

Right side: x^{4*(x^{10/x})}. So exponent is 4 times x^{10/x}.

So now the equation is:

x^{100/x} = x^{4 * (x^{10/x})}.

Since the bases are the same (base x), I can set the exponents equal to each other. So:

100/x = 4 * (x^{10/x}).

Let me write that as:

100/x = 4 * x^{10/x}.

Hmm, this looks a bit complicated, but maybe I can simplify it. Let's divide both sides by 4 to make it cleaner:

25/x = x^{10/x}.

So now I have 25/x = x^{10/x}.

Hmm, this seems challenging. Maybe taking natural logarithms on both sides would help. Let me try that.

Taking ln of both sides:

ln(25/x) = ln(x^{10/x}).

Simplify the right side using logarithm power rule: ln(a^b) = b*ln(a). So right side becomes (10/x) * ln(x).

Left side: ln(25/x) can be written as ln(25) - ln(x).

So equation becomes:

ln(25) - ln(x) = (10/x) * ln(x).

Let me rearrange terms to collect like terms together.

Bring all terms to one side:

ln(25) - ln(x) - (10/x) * ln(x) = 0.

Factor ln(x):

ln(25) - ln(x) [1 + 10/x] = 0.

Hmm, not sure if that helps. Alternatively, maybe I can let t = ln(x). Let's try that substitution.

Let t = ln(x). Then, since x > 1, t > 0.

So, ln(x) = t, so x = e^t.

Now, let's express the equation in terms of t.

We had:

ln(25) - ln(x) = (10/x) * ln(x).

Substituting t:

ln(25) - t = (10 / e^t) * t.

Simplify the right side: 10t / e^t.

So equation becomes:

ln(25) - t = (10t) / e^t.

Hmm, this is a transcendental equation involving t. It might not have a straightforward algebraic solution, but perhaps I can find t by trial or perhaps see if t is a nice number.

Alternatively, maybe I can find a substitution or manipulate it further.

Let me rearrange the equation:

ln(25) = t + (10t)/e^t.

Factor t on the right:

ln(25) = t [1 + 10 / e^t].

Hmm, this is still a bit complicated. Let me think if there's a way to make this equation easier. Maybe trying small integer values for t to see if it works.

Wait, ln(25) is a constant. Let me compute it. ln(25) is ln(5^2) which is 2 ln(5) ≈ 2 * 1.6094 ≈ 3.2188.

So, ln(25) ≈ 3.2188.

So, 3.2188 ≈ t [1 + 10/e^t].

Let me try to guess t. Let's try t=2.

Compute right side: t=2.

1 + 10/e^2 ≈ 1 + 10/(7.3891) ≈ 1 + 1.3534 ≈ 2.3534.

t * (2.3534) = 2 * 2.3534 ≈ 4.7068, which is greater than 3.2188.

So, need smaller t.

Try t=1.5.

Compute 1 + 10/e^{1.5}. e^{1.5} ≈ 4.4817.

10/4.4817 ≈ 2.23.

So 1 + 2.23 ≈ 3.23.

t * 3.23 = 1.5 * 3.23 ≈ 4.845. Still larger than 3.2188.

Wait, no, 4.845 is bigger than 3.2188, so need t smaller.

Wait, perhaps t=1.

Compute 1 + 10/e^1.

e^1=2.7183.

10/2.7183≈3.68.

So 1 + 3.68=4.68.

t * 4.68 = 1 *4.68=4.68. Still larger than 3.2188.

Hmm, so t needs to be less than 1.

Wait, let me try t=0.8.

Compute 10/e^{0.8}.

e^0.8≈2.2255.

10/2.2255≈4.492.

So 1 + 4.492≈5.492.

t *5.492=0.8*5.492≈4.3936. Still bigger than 3.2188.

t=0.5.

Compute 10/e^{0.5}.

e^0.5≈1.6487.

10/1.6487≈6.065.

So 1 +6.065≈7.065.

t *7.065=0.5*7.065≈3.5325.

Which is still
