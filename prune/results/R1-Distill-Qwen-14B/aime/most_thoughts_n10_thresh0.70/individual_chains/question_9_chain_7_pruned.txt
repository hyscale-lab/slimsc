Okay, so I've got this problem where there are real numbers x and y, both greater than 1, and they satisfy two logarithmic equations. The goal is to find the product xy. The problem is stated as:

log_x(y^x) = log_y(x^{4y}) = 10

Hmm, okay. Let me try to parse this. Both logarithmic expressions are equal to 10. So, log base x of y^x is 10, and log base y of x^{4y} is also 10. 

First, I'll recall some logarithm properties. The logarithm log_b(a) = c means that b^c = a. Also, log_b(a^k) = k * log_b(a). So maybe I can rewrite these equations using these properties.

Starting with the first equation: log_x(y^x) = 10.

Using the power rule, that becomes x * log_x(y) = 10. 

Wait, because log_x(y^x) is x * log_x(y). So, x * log_x(y) = 10.

But log_x(y) is the logarithm of y with base x, which is equal to (ln y)/(ln x), right? So, I can write this as x * (ln y)/(ln x) = 10.

Similarly, for the second equation: log_y(x^{4y}) = 10.

Again, using the power rule, this is 4y * log_y(x) = 10.

And log_y(x) is (ln x)/(ln y). So, substituting that in, we get 4y * (ln x)/(ln y) = 10.

Wait a second, so now I have two equations:

1. x * (ln y)/(ln x) = 10
2. 4y * (ln x)/(ln y) = 10

Hmm, I notice that the two equations have terms that are reciprocals of each other. Let me denote (ln y)/(ln x) as some variable to make it easier. Let's say let k = (ln y)/(ln x). Then, equation 1 becomes x * k = 10, so k = 10 / x.

But from the definition, k = (ln y)/(ln x). So, (ln y)/(ln x) = 10/x.

Which implies that ln y = (10/x) * ln x.

Alternatively, y = x^{10/x} because ln y = (10/x) ln x implies y = e^{(10/x) ln x} = x^{10/x}.

Okay, so that's an expression for y in terms of x. Now, let's look at the second equation.

Equation 2 is 4y * (ln x)/(ln y) = 10.

But (ln x)/(ln y) is 1/k, since k = (ln y)/(ln x). So, 4y * (1/k) = 10.

We already know that k = 10/x, so 1/k = x
