Okay, so I have this math problem here about Aya's morning walk and coffee shop stop. Let me try to figure it out step by step.

So, the problem says that Aya walks 9 kilometers every morning. She walks at a constant speed of 's' kilometers per hour, and this takes her 4 hours, including 't' minutes in the coffee shop. Then, when she walks at a faster speed, specifically 's + 2' km/h, the walk takes her 2 hours and 24 minutes, again including the same 't' minutes in the coffee shop. Now, we need to find out how long her walk would take if she walks at 's + 1/2' km/h, including the 't' minutes.

Hmm, let me break this down. So, the time she spends walking plus the time she spends in the coffee shop equals the total time given for each scenario. Since the coffee shop time 't' is the same in both cases, maybe I can set up equations and solve for 's' and 't'.

Wait, the first scenario: speed is 's' km/h, total time is 4 hours, which includes 't' minutes. But wait, minutes and hours. I should convert everything into the same units to make it easier. Maybe convert 't' into hours so that all the time units are consistent.

So, for the first case:
Walking time + coffee time = 4 hours
But walking time is distance divided by speed, right? So, walking time is 9 km / s km/h, which is 9/s hours. And coffee time is 't' minutes, which is t/60 hours. So total time is 9/s + t/60 = 4.

Similarly, for the second case, speed is (s + 2) km/h. Walking time is 9 / (s + 2) hours. Coffee time is still 't' minutes, so t/60 hours. Total time is 2 hours and 24 minutes. Let me convert 2h24m into hours. 24 minutes is 24/60 = 0.4 hours. So 2.4 hours total. So, 9/(s+2) + t/60 = 2.4.

So now I have two equations:

1) 9/s + t/60 = 4

2) 9/(s+2) + t/60 = 2.4

Hmm, so I can set this up as a system of equations. Let me write them clearly:

Equation (1): 9/s + t/60 = 4

Equation (2): 9/(s + 2) + t/60 = 2.4

I can subtract equation (2) from equation (1) to eliminate 't' since both have t/60. Let's do that.

Equation (1) - Equation (2):

[9/s + t/60] - [9/(s+2) + t/60] = 4 - 2.4

Simplify this:

9/s - 9/(s + 2) = 1.6

Now, let me compute 9/s - 9/(s + 2). Let's factor out the 9:

9 [1/s - 1/(s + 2)] = 1.6

Compute the difference inside the brackets:

1/s - 1/(s + 2) = [ (s + 2) - s ] / [s(s + 2)] = 2 / [s(s + 2)]

So, substitute back:

9 * [2 / (s(s + 2))] = 1.6

Simplify:

(18) / [s(s + 2)] = 1.6

Let me write this as:

18 = 1.6 * s(s + 2)

Let me compute 1.6 * s(s + 2):

1.6 s(s + 2) = 1.6 s² + 3.2 s

So, the equation becomes:

18 = 1.6 s² + 3.2 s

Hmm, let's rearrange this into a standard quadratic equation form:

1.6 s² + 3.2 s - 18 = 0

To make it easier, maybe multiply all terms by 10 to eliminate decimals:

16 s² + 32 s - 180 = 0

Wait, wait, actually, 1.6 multiplied by 10 is 16, 3.2 multiplied by 10 is 32, and 18 multiplied by 10 is 180. So, the equation becomes:

16 s² + 32 s - 180 = 0

Wait, but maybe I can simplify this equation by dividing
