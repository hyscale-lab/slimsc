Okay, let me try to figure out this probability problem. So, Jen is entering a lottery where she picks 4 distinct numbers from the set S = {1,2,3,...,10}. Then, 4 numbers are randomly chosen from S. She wins a prize if at least two of her numbers match two of the randomly chosen numbers. She wins the grand prize if all four of her numbers match the four chosen. We need to find the probability that she wins the grand prize given that she won a prize, and then express that as a reduced fraction m/n and find m + n.

Hmm, okay. So this is a conditional probability problem. The formula for conditional probability is P(A|B) = P(A ∩ B) / P(B). In this case, event A is winning the grand prize, and event B is winning a prize. But wait, if she wins the grand prize, then she must have won a prize because winning the grand prize means she has all four numbers matching, which certainly means at least two match. So A is a subset of B. Therefore, P(A ∩ B) is just P(A). So, the conditional probability is P(A)/P(B).

So, I need to find P(A), the probability of winning the grand prize, and P(B), the probability of winning a prize. Then, divide them.

First, let's figure out P(A). Winning the grand prize means her 4 numbers are exactly the 4 chosen. Since she picks 4 numbers, the number of possible winning combinations is 1 (her specific set). The total number of possible outcomes is the number of ways to choose 4 numbers from 10, which is C(10,4). So, P(A) = 1 / C(10,4).

Calculating C(10,4): 10! / (4! * (10-4)!) = (10*9*8*7)/(4*3*2*1) = 210. So, P(A) = 1/210.

Next, I need to find P(B), the probability that Jen wins a prize, which is when at least two of her numbers match the four randomly chosen. This could mean she has exactly 2, 3, or 4 numbers matching. So, I need to calculate the probability of exactly 2, exactly 3, and exactly 4 matches, and sum them up.

Alternatively, another approach is to compute 1 minus the probability of not winning a prize. That is, P(B) = 1 - P(no matches) - P(exactly 1 match). But I'm not sure if that's easier. Let me think.

Wait, no, because the problem says she wins a prize if at least two of her numbers are among the four chosen. So, it's exactly 2, 3, or 4 matches. So it's better to compute the number of favorable cases for each of these and sum them, then divide by the total number of possible cases.

So, let's denote:

- N: total number of ways to choose 4 numbers from 10: which is 210 as before.

- Let’s compute the number of ways she can have exactly k matches, where k=2,3,4.

So, for exactly k matches:

The number of ways is C(4,k) * C(6,4 - k). Wait, let me explain. She has 4 numbers, and she matches exactly k of them. So, the number of ways to choose k numbers from her 4, and then the remaining (4 - k) numbers from the numbers she didn't pick. Since the total numbers not picked by her are 10 - 4 = 6.

Therefore, the number of favorable cases for exactly k matches is C(4,k) * C(6, 4 - k). So for k=2: C(4,2)*C(6,2). For k=3: C(4
