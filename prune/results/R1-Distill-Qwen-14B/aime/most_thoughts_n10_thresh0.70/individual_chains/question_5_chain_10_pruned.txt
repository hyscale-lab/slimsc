Okay, so I have this geometry problem here about triangle ABC. There are eight circles of radius 34 that are sequentially tangent. Two of these circles are tangent to sides AB and BC of the triangle. Then, it says that 2024 circles of radius 1 can be arranged in the same manner. I need to find the inradius of triangle ABC, express it as a fraction m/n where m and n are coprime, and then find m + n.

Hmm, okay, let me try to visualize this. So, there are eight circles each with radius 34 arranged in a sequence where each is tangent to the next. Two of them are tangent to AB and BC. I'm assuming this is a problem involving some sort of chain of circles packed along two sides of a triangle, which would relate to the inradius.

Wait, when they say "sequentially tangent," I think that means each circle is tangent to the previous one. So, like a straight chain of circles along a line, but in this case, it's along two sides of a triangle. So, perhaps the circles are arranged such that they go from one side to another, moving along the sides of the triangle.

But in a triangle, sides meet at angles, so the chain of circles would have to bend around the corner. Hmm, so maybe it's like a circular chain going around the inradius? Or maybe it's forming some sort of spiral?

Wait, but the problem mentions that two of the circles are tangent to AB and BC. So, one circle is tangent to AB, the next is tangent to BC, and the rest are sequentially tangent. But if they're sequentially tangent, maybe they're arranged along the angle bisector? Or perhaps they're packed around the inradius.

Wait, perhaps it's similar to circles arranged in a straight line but with two circles tangent to each side. So, maybe the chain starts at AB, goes towards BC, and the circles are packed along that angle.

But I'm not entirely sure. Maybe I should think about what happens in a simpler case. Let's say there's just one circle tangent to AB and one circle tangent to BC. How would that work? Well, each circle would be tangent to one side, but then the next circle would have to be tangent to the previous one and to another side.

Wait, maybe it's forming a kind of a chain from AB to BC, with each circle in between tangent to the previous one. So, if
