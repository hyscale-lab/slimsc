Okay, so I have this problem here: I need to find the largest possible real part of the expression (75 + 117i)z + (96 + 144i)/z, where z is a complex number with |z| = 4. Hmm, alright, let's break this down step by step.

First, I know that for any complex number z, if |z| = 4, then its conjugate z̄ has a magnitude of 1/4 because |z̄| = 1/|z|. That might come in handy later, but I'm not sure yet.

Let me represent z in polar form. Since |z| = 4, I can write z as 4e^{iθ}, where θ is the argument of z. That seems like a good idea because it might make the expression easier to handle with exponentials.

So, substituting z = 4e^{iθ}, let's compute each part of the expression.

First term: (75 + 117i)z. That would be (75 + 117i)*4e^{iθ}. Let me compute that. 75*4 is 300, and 117*4 is 468. So, this term becomes (300 + 468i)e^{iθ}.

Second term: (96 + 144i)/z. Since z is 4e^{iθ}, 1/z is (1/4)e^{-iθ}. So, multiplying that by (96 + 144i) gives (96 + 144i)*(1/4)e^{-iθ}. Let's compute that: 96/4 is 24, and 144/4 is 36. So, this term is (24 + 36i)e^{-iθ}.

Putting it all together, the entire expression is (300 + 468i)e^{iθ} + (24 + 36i)e^{-iθ}.

Now, I want to find the real part of this expression. So, I need to compute the real parts of each term separately and then add them together.

Let me denote A = 300 + 468i and B = 24 + 36i. So, the expression is A e^{iθ} + B e^{-iθ}.

The real part of A e^{iθ} is Re(A e^{iθ}) = Re(A) cosθ - Im(A) sinθ. Similarly, the real part of B e^{-iθ} is Re(B e^{-iθ}) = Re(B) cosθ + Im(B) sinθ.

Wait, let me verify that. Because e^{-iθ} is cosθ - i sinθ, so when I multiply B with e^{-iθ}, the real part would be Re(B) cosθ + Im(B)(-sinθ). But wait, actually, let me do it correctly.

Let me write A e^{iθ} as (Re(A) + Im(A)i)(cosθ + i sinθ) = Re(A) cosθ - Im(A) sinθ + i(Re(A) sinθ + Im(A) cosθ). So, the real part is Re(A) cosθ - Im(A) sinθ.

Similarly, B e^{-iθ} is (Re(B) + Im(B)i)(cosθ - i sinθ) = Re(B) cosθ + Im(B) sinθ + i(-Re(B) sinθ + Im(B) cosθ). So, the real part is Re(B) cosθ + Im(B) sinθ.

So, adding these together, the total real part is [Re(A) cosθ - Im(A) sinθ] + [Re(B) cosθ + Im(B) sinθ]. Combine like terms:

= [Re(A) + Re(B)] cosθ + [ -Im(A) + Im(B) ] sinθ.

Let me compute Re(A) and Im(A):

Re(A) = 300, Im(A) = 468.

Re(B) = 24, Im(B) = 36.

So, substituting these, the expression becomes:

(300 + 24) cosθ + (-468 + 36) sinθ.

Simplify the coefficients:

300 +24 = 324.

-468 +36 = -432.

So, the real part is 324 cosθ - 432 sinθ.

So, the problem reduces to finding the maximum value of 324 cosθ - 432 sinθ.

Hmm, okay, this seems manageable. I remember that expressions of the form a cosθ + b sinθ can be rewritten as R cos(θ + φ), where R = sqrt(a^2 + b^2), and φ is some angle. The maximum value of such an expression is R, since the maximum of cos is 1.

Wait, but here the expression is 324 cosθ - 432 sinθ, which is equivalent to a cosθ + b sinθ with a=324 and b=-432. So, the maximum would be sqrt(324^2 + (-432)^2) = sqrt(324^2 + 432^2).

Alternatively, it
