Okay, so I've got this problem about counting the number of paths on an 8x8 grid. The paths are of length 16, which I think means they go from the lower left corner to the upper right corner, moving only right or up. But the twist here is that they have to change direction exactly four times. Hmm, okay, let me try to unpack this.

First, I remember that in a grid, the number of paths from the lower left to the upper right without any restrictions is a combination problem. Since you have to move 8 steps to the right and 8 steps up, the total number of steps is 16. So the number of paths is C(16,8), which is 12,870. But that's without any restrictions on direction changes. So, the problem here is about paths that change direction exactly four times. 

Wait, what does it mean to change direction exactly four times? Well, each time you switch from moving right to up or up to right, that's a direction change. So, if a path goes right, right, up, up, right, right, up, up, etc., each time it switches from right to up or up to right, that's a change. So, the number of direction changes is the number of times the direction switches.

But in a path from lower left to upper right, the path must start by going either right or up. Let's say the path starts with a right move. Then, every time it changes direction, it goes up, then right again, and so on. Similarly, if it starts with up, it alternates. So, the number of direction changes would be one less than the number of segments. For example, if a path has 5 segments (alternating right and up), then it changes direction 4 times.

Wait, that makes sense. So if a path has k segments, each segment being a consecutive move in one direction, then the number of direction changes is k-1. So, for four direction changes, the path must have 5 segments. 

So, for our problem, the path must have exactly five segments, alternating between right and up moves. Now, the question is, how many such paths are there in an 8x8 grid?

But wait, let me think about the specifics. Since the grid is 8x
