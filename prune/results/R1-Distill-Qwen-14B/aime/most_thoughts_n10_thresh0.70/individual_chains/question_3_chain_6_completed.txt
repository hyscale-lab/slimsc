Okay, so I have this probability problem to solve. Let me try to understand it step by step.

Jen is entering a lottery by picking 4 distinct numbers from the set S, which is {1,2,3,...,10}. Then, 4 numbers are randomly chosen from this same set S. 

She wins a prize if at least two of her numbers match two of the randomly chosen numbers. She wins the grand prize if all four of her numbers match the four randomly chosen numbers.

The question is about finding the probability that she wins the grand prize given that she won a prize. They mention this probability is m/n where m and n are coprime, and we need to find m + n.

Hmm, okay. So this is a conditional probability problem. I remember that conditional probability is calculated as P(A|B) = P(A and B) / P(B), but in this case, if she wins the grand prize, she must have won a prize because getting all four correct definitely means she has at least two correct. So actually, P(A and B) is just P(A), the probability of winning the grand prize. And P(B) is the probability of winning any prize (at least two correct numbers).

Therefore, the probability we're looking for is P(grand prize) / P(at least two correct).

Let me formalize this.

Let’s denote:
- A: the event that Jen wins the grand prize (all four numbers match).
- B: the event that Jen wins a prize (at least two numbers match).

We need to find P(A | B) = P(A) / P(B).

First, let me compute P(A), the probability of winning the grand prize.

The total number of ways to choose 4 numbers from 10 is C(10,4). Only one of these combinations will be the winning combination. So,

P(A) = 1 / C(10,4).

Calculating C(10,4): 10! / (4! * (10-4)!) = (10*9*8*7)/(4*3*2*1) = 210. So P(A) = 1/210.

Now, I need to compute P(B), the probability of winning a prize, which is the probability that at least two of the four numbers match. 

But "at least two" can be broken down into cases: exactly two, exactly three, or exactly four correct numbers. However, since we know that winning the grand prize (exactly four correct) is a subset of this, perhaps it's easier to calculate P(B) as 1 - probability of having fewer than two correct numbers.

But wait, let me think. Alternatively, I can calculate the number of ways she can have exactly two, exactly three, or exactly four correct numbers, and sum those up, then divide by the total number of possible combinations (C(10,4)).

So, let's compute the number of favorable outcomes for each case.

First, the total number of possible outcomes when 4 numbers are chosen is C(10,4) = 210.

Case 1: Exactly two correct numbers.

To compute this, Jen has chosen 4 numbers. The number of ways that exactly two of them are in the winning set is C(4,2) * C(6,2). Because she has 4 correct numbers, she needs to choose 2 from them, and the remaining 2 from the 6 incorrect numbers (since S has 10, and 4 are correct, 6 are incorrect).

So, number of ways = C(4,2) * C(6,2).

Calculating:

C(4,2) = 6.

C(6,2) = 15.

So, 6 * 15 = 90.

Case 2: Exactly three correct numbers.

Similarly, the number of ways is C(4,3) * C(6,1).

C(4,3) = 4.

C(6,1) = 6.

So, 4 * 6 = 24.

Case 3: Exactly four correct numbers.

That's just 1 way, as only the entire set is correct.

So, adding up all the favorable outcomes:

90 (exactly two) + 24 (exactly three) + 1 (exactly four) = 115.

Therefore, the number of ways she can win a prize is 115, out of 210 total.

Wait, hold on. Wait, no, that's not correct. Because in the scenario, the lottery is that 4 numbers are randomly chosen from S, and Jen has already chosen her 4 numbers. So the number of possible lottery draws is C(10,4)=210, and the number of favorable draws is the number of 4-number combinations that share at least two numbers with Jen's set. So, yes, the number is 115.

Wait, but hold on a second, let me verify the calculation.

Wait, 90 (exactly two) + 24 (exactly three) + 1 (exactly four) = 115.

So, the number of favorable outcomes is 115.

Therefore, P(B) = 115 / 210.

Simplify that: 115 and 210 are both divisible by 5. 115 ÷5=23; 210 ÷5=42. So, 23/42.

So, P(B) = 23/42.

Earlier, P(A) = 1/210.

Therefore, the conditional probability P(A|B) = (1/210) / (23/42).

Let me compute that.

First, 23/42 is the same as 23/(42). So, dividing 1/210 by 23/42 is equal to (1/210)*(42/23).

Simplify:

42/210 = 1/5.

So, 1/210 * 42/23 = (1/5) * (1/23) = 1/(5*23) = 1/115.

Wait, so P(A|B) is 1/115.

But wait, that seems a bit low. Let me double-check my calculations.

Wait, 1/210 divided by 23/42. Let me compute 1/210 ÷ 23/42.

Dividing fractions: multiply by reciprocal.

So, 1/210 * 42/23.

Simplify 42/210: that's 1/5. So, 1/210 * 42/23 = (1/5) * (1/23) = 1/115.

Yes, that's correct.

So, the probability is 1/115. So, m is 1 and n is 115. Are they coprime? Yes, since 1 is coprime with every number.

Therefore, m + n = 1 + 115 = 116.

Wait, but let me make sure I did everything correctly. Let me go through the steps again.

Total possible lottery combinations: C(10,4)=210. Correct.

Number of ways to have exactly two correct: C(4,2)*C(6,2)=6*15=90. Correct.

Exactly three correct: C(4,3)*C(6,1)=4*6=24. Correct.

Exactly four correct: 1. Correct.

Total favorable for B: 90+24+1=115. Correct.

So, P(B)=115/210=23/42. Correct.

P(A)=1/210. Correct.

Thus, 1/210 divided by 23/42 is indeed 1/115. So, the answer is 1/115, so m +n=1+115=116.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused because sometimes in probability, especially with overlapping events, I might have made a mistake.

Alternatively, maybe I should think in terms of combinations. So, given that she has a prize, meaning that at least two numbers match, what's the probability all four match.

Alternatively, perhaps I can model it as hypergeometric probability.

The problem is similar to drawing 4 cards without replacement from a deck of 10, where 4 are of one kind (the winning set) and 6 are of another. We want the probability that all 4 are from the winning set, given that at least 2 are from the winning set.

In hypergeometric terms, the probability of k successes (correct numbers) in n draws (4) without replacement from a finite population (10) containing a specific number of successes (4).

Wait, but in this case, the population is the set S, and the "successes" are the 4 numbers Jen picked. Then, the number of possible ways to choose 4 numbers with exactly k successes is C(4,k)*C(6,4−k). So, yeah, that's how we got 90, 24, 1.

So, yes, the counts are correct.

Therefore, the conditional probability is correct as 1/115.

Thus, m is 1, n is 115, so m + n is 116.

**Final Answer**
\boxed{116}


Jen enters a lottery by picking 4 distinct numbers from the set \( S = \{1, 2, 3, \ldots, 10\} \). Four numbers are randomly chosen from \( S \). She wins a prize if at least two of her numbers match two of the randomly chosen numbers, and wins the grand prize if all four of her numbers match the randomly chosen numbers. We need to find the probability of winning the grand prize given that she won a prize.

First, we calculate the probability of winning the grand prize, \( P(A) \). The total number of ways to choose 4 numbers from 10 is \( \binom{10}{4} = 210 \). Only one of these combinations will be the winning combination, so:

\[ P(A) = \frac{1}{210} \]

Next, we calculate the probability of winning a prize, \( P(B) \). This is the probability of having at least two correct numbers. We break this down into cases: exactly two, exactly three, or exactly four correct numbers.

- Exactly two correct numbers: \( \binom{4}{2} \binom{6}{2} = 6 \times 15 = 90 \)
- Exactly three correct numbers: \( \binom{4}{3} \binom{6}{1} = 4 \times 6 = 24 \)
- Exactly four correct numbers: \( 1 \)

Adding these, the total number of favorable outcomes is \( 90 + 24 + 1 = 115 \). Therefore,

\[ P(B) = \frac{115}{210} = \frac{23}{42} \]

The conditional probability \( P(A | B) \) is given by:

\[ P(A | B) = \frac{P(A)}{P(B)} = \frac{\frac{1}{210}}{\frac{23}{42}} = \frac{1}{210} \times \frac{42}{23} = \frac{1}{115} \]

Thus, the probability is \( \frac{1}{115} \), where \( m = 1 \) and \( n = 115 \). Therefore, \( m + n = 1 + 115 = 116 \).

\[
\boxed{116}
