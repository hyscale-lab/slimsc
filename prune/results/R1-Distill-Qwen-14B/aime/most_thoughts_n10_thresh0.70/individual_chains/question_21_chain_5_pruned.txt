Okay, so I have this problem here about something called b-eautiful numbers. Let me try to understand it step by step.

First, the problem says that for an integer b ≥ 2, a positive integer n is called b-eautiful if two conditions are met. One, when n is expressed in base b, it has exactly two digits. Two, the sum of these two digits equals the square root of n. An example is given: 81 is 13-eautiful because in base 13, 81 is written as 63, and 6 + 3 equals the square root of 81, which is 9.

The task is to find the least integer b ≥ 2 for which there are more than ten b-eautiful integers. So, we need to find the smallest base b where there are over ten numbers n that satisfy these conditions.

Let me break down the problem. First, I need to represent n in base b with exactly two digits. In any base b, a two-digit number is of the form d1 * b + d0, where d1 and d0 are digits in base b. Since it's a two-digit number, d1 can't be zero, so d1 must be at least 1. Also, both d1 and d0 must be less than b because they are digits in base b.

So, n = d1 * b + d0. The sum of the digits is d1 + d0, and this sum must equal sqrt(n). Therefore, we have:

d1 + d0 = sqrt(n) = sqrt(d1 * b + d0).

Let me denote s = d1 + d0, then:

s = sqrt(d1 * b + d0).

Squaring both sides gives:

s² = d1 * b + d0.

But since s = d1 + d0, we can substitute d0 in the equation. Let me solve for d0:

d0 = s - d1.

Substituting back into the equation:

s² = d1 * b + (s - d1).

Simplify:

s² = d1 * b + s - d1.

Factor d1:

s² = d1 * (b - 1) + s.

Then, rearrange for d1:

d1 = (s² - s) / (b - 1).

Hmm, so d1 must be an integer because it's a digit. Therefore, (s² - s) must be divisible by (b - 1).

But wait, d1 is also a digit in base b, so d1 must satisfy 1 ≤ d1 ≤ b - 1. Similarly, d0 = s - d1 must satisfy 0 ≤ d0 ≤ b - 1.

So, let's list the constraints:

1. 1 ≤ d1 ≤ b - 1
2. 0 ≤ d0 = s - d1 ≤ b - 1
3. s = d1 + d0
4. n = d1 * b + d0 = s²

So, for each base b, I need to find the number of pairs (d1, d0) such that:

- d1 is between 1 and b - 1
- d0 is between 0 and b - 1
- d1 + d0 = s
- s² = d1 * b + d0

But substituting d0 = s - d1 into the equation n = s² gives:

s² = d1 * b + (s - d1)
s² = d1*(b - 1) + s
Which is the equation I had earlier.

So, solving for d1:

d1 = (s² - s) / (b - 1)

Since d1 must be an integer, (s² - s) must be divisible by (b - 1). Also, d1 must be in the range [1, b-1], and d0 must be in [0, b-1].

So, for a given b, I can iterate over possible s values and check if (s² - s) is divisible by (b - 1), then compute d1 and d0 to see if they satisfy the digit constraints.

But maybe it's better to think in terms of s and b. Let's see.

Let me consider s as the sum of the digits, which equals sqrt(n). Since n is a two-digit number in base b, n is at least b (since the smallest two-digit number is 10_b = b) and at most (b-1)*b + (b-1) = b² - 1. So, sqrt(n) must be between sqrt(b) and sqrt(b² - 1), which is between roughly sqrt(b) and b.

But s is sqrt(n), which is also equal to d1 + d0. The maximum possible value of s is (b-1) + (b-1) = 2b - 2, but since n is at most b² - 1, s is at most sqrt(b² - 1) ≈ b. So, s is between 1 and b.

Wait, but for two digits, d1 is at least 1, so s = d1 + d0 is at least 1, and at most (b-1) + (b-1) = 2b - 2. But n is at most b² -1, so s is at most sqrt(b² -1) which is less than b. So actually, s is between 1 and b - 1.

Wait, that seems conflicting. Let me think again.

Wait, n can be up to (b-1)*b + (b-1) = b² - 1, so sqrt(n) can be up to sqrt(b² -1) ≈ b - 1/(2b) (from Taylor series, but for our purposes, approximately b). So, s can be up to roughly b.

But s is the sum of two digits, each less than b, so the maximum s is 2b - 2, but the sqrt(n) is at most about b. So, s can actually be up to 2b - 2, but n is s², so n's maximum is (2b - 2)^2, which is way larger than b² - 1
