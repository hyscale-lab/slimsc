Okay, so I've got this math problem here: There exist real numbers x and y, both greater than 1, such that log base x of y^x equals 10, and log base y of x^{4y} also equals 10. I need to find the product xy. Hmm, okay, let me try to break this down.

First, I remember that logarithms can be tricky, but maybe I can rewrite these equations in exponential form to make them easier to handle. Let me write down the two equations:

1. log_x(y^x) = 10
2. log_y(x^{4y}) = 10

I recall that log_b(a) = c is equivalent to b^c = a. So applying that here:

From the first equation: x^10 = y^x. That's because log_x(y^x) = 10 implies that x raised to the 10th power equals y raised to the xth power.

Similarly, the second equation: y^10 = x^{4y}. That comes from log_y(x^{4y}) = 10, so y to the 10th power equals x raised to the 4y power.

So now I have two equations:

1. x^10 = y^x
2. y^10 = x^{4y}

Hmm, I need to find x and y such that both of these are true. Maybe I can express one variable in terms of the other and substitute.

Looking at equation 1: x^10 = y^x. Let me take both sides to the power of 1/x to solve for y. That would give y = (x^10)^(1/x) = x^{10/x}.

So, y = x^{10/x}. Let me note that down. Maybe I can substitute this into the second equation.

Substituting y into equation 2: (x^{10/x})^10 = x^{4*(x^{10/x})}.

Let me simplify the left side first: (x^{10/x})^10 = x^{(10/x)*10} = x^{100/x}.

The right side is x^{4y}, and since y is x^{10/x}, it becomes x^{4 * x^{10/x}}.

So now, the equation is x^{100/x} = x^{4 * x^{10/x}}.

Since the bases are the same and x > 1, I can set the exponents equal to each other. So:

100/x = 4 * x^{10/x}.

Let me write this as:

100/x = 4 * x^{10/x}.

Divide both sides by 4: 25/x = x^{10/x}.

Hmm, that's interesting. So 25/x = x^{10/x}.

Let me denote t = x^{1/x}. Because x^{10/x} is (x^{1/x})^{10}, which is t^{10}.

Wait, let me see: x^{1/x} is t, so x^{10/x} is (x^{1/x})^10 = t^10.

But wait, 25/x = x^{10/x} = t^10.

Also, since t = x^{1/x}, taking natural logs on both sides: ln t = (1/x) ln x.

Hmm, not sure if that helps directly, but let's see.

So, from 25/x = t^10, and t = x^{1/x}, so substituting, 25/x = (x^{1/x})^10.

Wait, that's the same as before. Hmm.

Maybe I can take natural logs of both sides of 25/x = t^10.

Wait, perhaps another approach. Let me take logs of both sides of 25/x = x^{10/x}.

So, ln(25/x) = (10/x) ln x.

Let me write this as:

ln(25) - ln x = (10/x) ln x.

Hmm, let me rearrange terms:

ln(25) = (10/x) ln x + ln x.

Factor out ln x on the right side:

ln(25) = ln x (10/x + 1).

Hmm, so ln(25) = ln x ( (10 + x)/x ).

Let me write that as:

ln(25) = (ln x) * ( (x + 10)/x ).

Hmm, this looks a bit complicated. Maybe I can denote u = ln x, then x = e^u.

Substituting, let's see:

ln(25) = u * ( (e^u + 10)/e^u ).

Simplify denominator:

(e^u + 10)/e^u = 1 + 10 e^{-u}.

So, ln(25) = u (1 + 10 e^{-u}).

Hmm, so:

u + 10 u e^{-u} = ln(25).

This is a transcendental equation in u. It might not have an algebraic solution, but maybe I can find a clever substitution or see if u is a nice integer or rational number.

Let me think: 25 is 5 squared, ln(25) is 2 ln5 ≈ 3.2189.

Wait, let's compute ln(25): ln(25) ≈ 3.2189.

So, u + 10 u e^{-u} ≈ 3.2189.

Looking for u such that u(1 + 10 e^{-u}) ≈ 3.2189.

Hmm, Maybe I can guess a value for u. Let me try u=2.

Then, 2*(1 + 10 e^{-2}) = 2*(1 + 10/(e^2)) ≈ 2*(1 + 10/7.389) ≈ 2*(1 + 1.
