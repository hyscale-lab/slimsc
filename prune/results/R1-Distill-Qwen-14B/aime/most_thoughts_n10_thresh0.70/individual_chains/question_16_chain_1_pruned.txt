Okay, so I have this math problem here. Let me read it again and try to understand what it's asking. 

"The last line of your response should be your integer answer within \boxed{}.

Let $p$ be the least prime number for which there exists a positive integer $n$ such that $n^{4}+1$ is divisible by $p^{2}$. Find the least positive integer $m$ such that $m^{4}+1$ is divisible by $p^{2}$."

Hmm, so I need to find the smallest prime p such that p squared divides n^4 + 1 for some positive integer n. Then, once I find that p, I have to find the smallest m where m^4 +1 is divisible by p squared.

Alright, let's start with the first part: finding the smallest prime p where p² divides n⁴ +1 for some n. 

I remember that primes p for which there exists an n such that n² ≡ -1 mod p are primes where p ≡ 1 mod 4. Because the multiplicative group mod p is cyclic of order p-1, so for -1 to be a square, p-1 must be even, meaning p is 1 mod 4. So, primes like 5, 13, 17, etc. 

But wait, this isn't just about n² ≡ -1 mod p, it's about n⁴ ≡ -1 mod p². So, we're looking for primes p where there exists n such that n⁴ ≡ -1 mod p². 

I think I need to use Hensel's lemma here or something about lifting solutions modulo p to modulo p². Because if n⁴ ≡ -1 mod p, then under certain conditions, we can lift that solution to mod p². 

First, let's check small primes p where -1 is a quartic residue modulo p. Because if n⁴ ≡ -1 mod p has a solution, then perhaps it can be lifted to mod p². 

So, let's list primes p where -1 is a quartic residue. 

Wait, but n^4 ≡ -1 mod p implies that -1 is a fourth power modulo p. So, what are the conditions for that? 

I know that for -1 to be a square modulo p, p must be 1 mod 4. For it to be a fourth power, maybe p needs to be 1 mod 8? Or maybe 1 mod something else. Let me think.

The multiplicative group mod p is cyclic of order p-1. So, for -1 to be a fourth power, the equation x^4 ≡ -1 mod p must have a solution. 

Let me think about the order of -1. The order of -1 is 2, so if there exists x such that x^4 = -1, then the order of x must be 8. Because x^8 = 1. So, 8 must divide p-1. Therefore, p ≡ 1 mod 8. 

Wait, so primes p ≡ 1 mod 8 will have that -1 is a fourth
