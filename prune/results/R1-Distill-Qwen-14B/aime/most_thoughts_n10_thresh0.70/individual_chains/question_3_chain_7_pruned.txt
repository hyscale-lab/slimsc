Okay, so Jen is entering this lottery where she picks 4 distinct numbers from the set S = {1,2,3,...,9,10}. Then, 4 numbers are randomly chosen from S as well. She wins a prize if at least two of her numbers match two of the randomly chosen numbers. She wins the grand prize if all four of her numbers match the randomly chosen ones.

The question is asking for the probability that she won the grand prize given that she won a prize. They mention this probability will be a fraction m/n where m and n are coprime, and we have to find m + n.

Hmm, so I need to find P(grand prize | won prize). By the definition of conditional probability, this is equal to P(grand prize and prize) / P(prize). But wait, if she wins the grand prize, she must have won a prize because winning the grand prize implies she has at least two numbers matching. So, P(grand prize and prize) is just P(grand prize). Therefore, P(grand prize | prize) = P(grand prize) / P(prize).

Alright, so I need to compute two probabilities: the probability that she wins the grand prize, and the probability that she wins any prize (which includes winning the grand prize).

Let me start by understanding the setup. The total number of ways to choose 4 numbers from 10 is C(10,4). That's the total number of possible sets for the lottery draw. Similarly, Jen picks 4 distinct numbers, so her choice is one specific combination.

First, let's compute P(grand prize). That's the probability that all four of her numbers are chosen. Since the lottery also picks 4 numbers, the only way she can win the grand prize is if her four numbers are exactly the same as the four picked. So, how many possible winning combinations are there? Just 1, because she has to match exactly the four numbers. So the probability is 1 / C(10,4).

Wait, let me confirm that. C(10,4) is 210, right? Because 10 choose 4 is 210. So P(grand prize) is 1/210.

Now, moving on to the probability that she wins a prize, which is the probability that at least two of her numbers are chosen. This is a bit more involved. So, in probability terms, we can think of the number of matches between her numbers and the lottery numbers. Let X be the number of matching numbers. We want P(X â‰¥ 2). So, this includes X=2, X=3, and X=4.

But wait, X=4 is exactly the grand prize case. So, P(prize) = P(X=2) + P(X=3) + P(X=4).

Alternatively, another way is to compute 1 - P(X < 2), which is 1 - [P(X=0) + P(X=1)]. Maybe that's easier. Let's see.

So, to compute P(X=k), where k is the number of matches, we can use the hyperge
