Okay, so I have this problem about a tetrahedron ABCD. The edges have specific lengths: AB and CD are sqrt(41), AC and BD are sqrt(80), and BC and AD are sqrt(89). I need to find the distance from the incenter I to each of the faces. The answer should be in the form mâˆšn / p, and then I have to find m + n + p.

Hmm, I remember that in a tetrahedron, the incenter is the point equidistant from all four faces, kind of like the 3D version of the inradius in a triangle. So the distance from I to each face is the inradius. I think the formula for the inradius r is 3V / S, where V is the volume of the tetrahedron and S is the total surface area. So I need to find V and S.

First, let's note down the given edge lengths:

AB = CD = sqrt(41)
AC = BD = sqrt(80)
BC = AD = sqrt(89)

Hmm, this seems symmetric. Maybe the tetrahedron is isohedral or something? Or perhaps it's a kind of 'kite' tetrahedron? Not sure, but the symmetry might help.

Wait, in a tetrahedron, if opposite edges are equal, it's called an isosceles tetrahedron. I think that in such cases, the tetrahedron has some nice properties, like all faces being congruent or something. Wait, no, not all faces, but maybe the faces opposite each other are congruent.

But for this problem, maybe I can consider the coordinates of the tetrahedron to make calculations easier. Assign coordinates to the vertices in 3D space such that the calculations are manageable.

Let's try to set up a coordinate system. Let me denote the points as A, B, C, D.

Since the opposite edges are equal, maybe I can position the points so that the midpoints of opposite edges coincide.

Wait, in an isosceles tetrahedron, the midpoints of opposite edges coincide, and the centroid is equidistant from all vertices. But I'm not sure if that's directly useful here.

Alternatively, another approach is to place the tetrahedron in a coordinate system where some points are at convenient coordinates
