Okay, so I've got this problem here where I need to find the number of triples of nonnegative integers (a, b, c) that satisfy two conditions: a + b + c = 300, and a²b + a²c + b²a + b²c + c²a + c²b = 6,000,000. Hmm, that seems a bit complicated, but maybe I can break it down.

First, let me write down what I know. The first equation is straightforward: a + b + c = 300. That's a linear equation, so I know that the variables are related in a simple additive way. The second equation is a bit more complex: it's a combination of terms where each variable is squared and multiplied by the other two. So, let's see, maybe I can factor that expression.

Looking at the second equation: a²b + a²c + b²a + b²c + c²a + c²b. Hmm, I notice that each term is symmetric in two variables, like a²b and a²c both have a², and similarly for the others. Maybe I can factor out some terms. Let's try factoring:

a²b + a²c = a²(b + c)
Similarly, b²a + b²c = b²(a + c)
And c²a + c²b = c²(a + b)

So putting it all together, the second equation becomes:
a²(b + c) + b²(a + c) + c²(a + b) = 6,000,000.

Now, since a + b + c = 300, I can substitute b + c with (300 - a), a + c with (300 - b), and a + b with (300 - c). So substituting, the equation becomes:

a²(300 - a) + b²(300 - b) + c²(300 - c) = 6,000,000.

Hmm, that's an interesting form. Let me write this as:
300a² - a³ + 300b² - b³ + 300c² - c³ = 6,000,000.

Which can be rearranged as:
300(a² + b² + c²) - (a³ + b³ + c³) = 6,000,000.

Now, I have this equation involving a², a³, etc. Maybe I can express this in terms of symmetric sums or something. Alternatively, perhaps I can relate this to the sum a + b + c and other symmetric functions.

I remember that for variables a, b, c, there are some identities involving sums of their powers. Let me recall some of them. For example, I know that (a + b + c)^2 = a² + b² + c² + 2(ab + bc + ac). Since I know a + b + c is 300, maybe I can express a² + b² + c² in terms of that.

Let me compute S1 = a + b + c = 300.

Then, S2 = ab + bc + ac. From the identity, S1² = a² + b² + c² + 2S2. So, a² + b² + c² = S1² - 2S2 = 300² - 2S2 = 90,000 - 2S2.

So, going back to the equation I had:

300(a² + b² + c²) - (a³ + b³ + c³) = 6,000,000.

Let me substitute a² + b² + c²:

300*(90,000 - 2S2) - (a³ + b³ + c³) = 6,000,000.

Calculating 300*90,000: 300 * 90,000 = 27,000,000.

Then, 300*(-2S2) = -600 S2.

So the equation becomes:

27,000,000 - 600 S2 - (a³ + b³ + c³) = 6,000,000.

Subtracting 6,000,000 from both sides:

27,000,000 - 6,000,000 - 600 S2 - (a³ + b³ + c³) = 0
21,000,000 - 600 S2 - (a³ + b³ + c³) = 0
Which implies:
a³ + b³ + c³ + 600 S2 = 21,000,000.

Hmm. Now, I need to find an expression for a³ + b³ + c³. I remember that there's an identity for that in terms of S1, S2, and S3, where S3 is the product abc.

The identity is:
a³ + b³ + c³ = (a + b + c)^3 - 3(a + b + c)(ab + bc + ac) + 3abc
So, substituting the known values:
a³ + b³ + c³ = S1³ - 3 S1 S2 + 3 S3.

So, S1 is 300, so S1³ = 300³ = 27,000,000.

So, substituting back into the equation:

a³ + b³ + c³ = 27,000,000 - 3*300*S2 + 3 S3
= 27,000,000 - 900 S2 + 3 S3.

Now, going back to the equation from before:

a³ + b³ + c³ + 600 S2 = 21,000,000.

Substituting the expression for a³ + b³ + c³:

(27,000,000 - 900 S2 + 3 S3) + 600 S2 = 21,000,000.

Simplify the left side:

27,000,000 - 900 S2 + 3 S3 + 600 S2
= 27,000,000 - 300 S2 + 3 S3.

Set equal to 21,000,000:

27,000,000 - 300 S2 + 3 S3 = 21,000,000.

Subtract 21,000,000 from both sides:

6,000,000 - 300 S2 + 3 S3 = 0.

Let me rearrange this:

-300 S2 + 3 S3 = -6,000,000.

Divide both sides by 3:

-100 S2 + S3 = -2,000,000.

Which can be rewritten as:

S3 = 100 S2 - 2,000,000.

So, now I have an equation relating S2 and S3: S3 = 100 S2 - 2,000,000.

But S3 is the product abc, and S2 is ab + bc + ac.

So, I have abc = 100(ab + bc + ac) - 2,000,000.

Hmm, this is an equation involving S2 and S3. Maybe I can write it as:

abc - 100(ab + bc + ac) = -2,000,000.

Hmm, not sure if that helps. Maybe I can factor this equation somehow.

Alternatively, perhaps I can express ab + bc + ac in terms of S2.

Alternatively, perhaps I can think about variables x = a, y = b, z = c. Then x + y + z = 300, and we have another equation involving x, y, z.

Wait, maybe I can think of this system of equations.

We have:

1) x + y + z = 300.

2) x²y + x²z + y²x + y²z + z²x + z²y = 6,000,000.

We also arrived at an equation involving S2 and S3:

S3 = 100 S2 - 2,000,000.

So, perhaps if I can find possible values of S2 and S3 that satisfy this.

But S3 is abc, and S2 is ab + bc + ac.

Hmm. Alternatively, maybe I can think about the variables as symmetric, and perhaps assume that two variables are equal or something to reduce the problem.

Alternatively, perhaps I can consider that variables could be zero, but maybe not since that might complicate things. Wait, but nonnegative integers, so zero is allowed.

Wait, another idea: since the
