Okay, so I've got this math problem here, and I need to find the smallest integer base b (where b is at least 2) such that there are more than ten b-eautiful numbers. Hmm. Let's break down what it means for a number n to be b-eautiful.

First, n must be a two-digit number in base b. That means when you write n in base b, it has exactly two digits. So, in base 10, that's numbers from 10 to 99, right? But in base b, it would be numbers from b^1 to b^2 - 1. Because the first digit can't be zero, so the smallest two-digit number in base b is 10_b, which is b in decimal, and the largest is (b^2 - 1).

So, any two-digit number in base b can be expressed as n = a * b + c, where a and c are digits in base b. That means a can range from 1 to b-1, and c can range from 0 to b-1. So, a is the tens digit, and c is the units digit in base b.

Now, the problem says that n is b-eautiful if the sum of these two digits, a + c, equals the square root of n. So, mathematically, that's a + c = sqrt(n). But since n is a two-digit number in base b, n = a*b + c. So, we can write:

a + c = sqrt(a*b + c)

Hmm. Let me square both sides to eliminate the square root:

(a + c)^2 = a*b + c

Expanding the left side:

a^2 + 2ac + c^2 = a*b + c

Let me rearrange the equation to bring all terms to one side:

a^2 + 2ac + c^2 - a*b - c = 0

Hmm, maybe factor this a bit. Let's see:

a^2 + (2c - b)a + (c^2 - c) = 0

This is a quadratic equation in terms of a. So, for each c, given a base b, we can solve for a.

But since a and c are digits in base b, their values are constrained. a must be between 1 and b-1, and c must be between 0 and b-1.

Wait, but perhaps it's easier to think in terms of n. Since a + c = sqrt(n), then n must be a perfect square because the square of an integer. So, n is equal to (a + c)^2.

But n is also equal to a*b + c. So, (a + c)^2 = a*b + c.

So, (a + c)^2 - c = a*b

Which can be rewritten as:

b = [ (a + c)^2 - c ] / a

Simplify the numerator:

(a + c)^2 - c = a^2 + 2ac + c^2 - c

So, b = (a^2 + 2ac + c^2 - c) / a

We can split this fraction:

b = a + 2c + (c^2 - c)/a

Since b must be an integer, (c^2 - c)/a must be an integer as well. Let's denote k = (c^2 - c)/a. Then, since a is a positive integer, k must be an integer, so a must divide (c^2 - c). Hmm.

So, a must be a divisor of c(c - 1). Because c(c - 1) is c^2 - c. So, a divides c(c - 1).

Now, since a and c are both digits in base b, a is between 1 and b-1, and c is between 0 and b-1. So, for each base b, we can iterate over possible a and c values where a divides c(c - 1), and then compute b using the equation above.

But this seems a bit abstract. Maybe I can approach it differently. Let's think about possible values of s = a + c, since s = sqrt(n). Then, n = s^2, which must also equal a*b + c.

So, s^2 = a*b + c

But s = a + c, so substituting:

s^2 = a*b + (s - a)

Because c = s - a. So:

s^2 = a*b + s - a

Rearranging:

s^2 - s = a*(b - 1)

So, a = (s^2 - s)/(b - 1)

Hmm, interesting. So, a must be an integer, so (s^2 - s) must be divisible by (b - 1). Let me write that as:

(b - 1) divides (s^2 - s)

Which can also be written as:

s^2 ≡ s mod (b - 1)

So,

s(s - 1) ≡ 0 mod (b - 1)

Which means that either s ≡ 0 mod (b-1) or s ≡ 1 mod (b-1). Because (s - 1) and s are consecutive integers, they are coprime. So, their product is 0 mod (b-1) only if one of them is 0 mod (b-1).

Wait, that might not necessarily be the case because (b-1) could have factors that are in s or in s-1. So, the product s*(s-1) must be divisible by (b-1). So, (b-1) must be a factor of s*(s - 1).

But s is the sum of two digits a and c, each of which is less than b. So, s = a + c ≤ (b - 1) + (b - 1) = 2b - 2. Hmm, but s is sqrt(n), and n is at most (b)^2 - 1. So sqrt(n) is at most b^2 - 1, but that's only when n is b^2 -1. Wait, no, n is a two-digit number, which is up to b^2 -1, but sqrt(n) would be up to sqrt(b^2 -1) < b. So, s must be less than b.

Wait, but s = a + c, and a is at least 1, c is at least 0, so s is at least 1. And since a is at most b-1 and c is at most b-1, s can be up to 2b - 2, but since sqrt(n) is less than b, s must be less than b. Because n is less than b^2, so s = sqrt(n) < b. So, s < b.

Wait, that's a key point. So, s is less than b. So, s can be from 1 up to b-1. Because n is a two-digit number in base b, n is at least b, so s must be at least sqrt(b). So, s ≥ sqrt(b). Since s is an integer, s ≥ ceiling(sqrt(b)).

So, s is in the range ceiling(sqrt(b)) ≤ s ≤ b - 1.

Now, from earlier, we have s^2 - s = a*(b - 1)

So, a = (s^2 - s)/(b -1)

But a must be an integer between 1 and b-1.

So, (s^2 - s) must be divisible by (b - 1), and the result of that division is a, which is between 1 and b-1.

So, for each s from ceiling(sqrt(b)) up to b-1, (s^2 - s)/(b -1) must be an integer, and that integer a must be between 1 and b-1.

But since for each b, the number of b-eautiful numbers is equal to the number of valid s values (i.e., the number of s where a is an integer in the required range), we need to find the smallest b where this count exceeds 10.

Wait, but how do we find b? Maybe it's easier to think in terms of s and b. For each s, b must satisfy that (s^2 - s) is divisible by (b -1), so (b -1) divides s(s - 1). So, for each s, (b -1) must be a divisor of s(s - 1). Since s < b, but (s(s - 1)) is less than s^2, which is less than b^2 (since s < b). Hmm, but how does that help?

Alternatively, for a given b, we can compute all possible s from ceiling(sqrt(b
