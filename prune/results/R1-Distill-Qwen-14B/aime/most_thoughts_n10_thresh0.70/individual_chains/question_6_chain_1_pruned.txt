Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the number of intersections between two graphs. The first graph is y = 4 g(f(sin(2πx))) and the second is x = 4 g(f(cos(3πy))). That sounds a bit complicated, but let me break it down step by step.

First, I should understand what functions f and g are. The problem defines f(x) as ||x| - 1/2| and g(x) as ||x| - 1/4|. So both f and g are transformations of the absolute value function, which usually makes V-shaped graphs. Let me try to visualize f(x) and g(x).

For f(x) = ||x| - 1/2|:
- The inner part is |x|, which is a V-shape with the vertex at (0,0).
- Subtracting 1/2 gives |x| - 1/2. This shifts the graph down by 1/2. So the vertex would be at (0, -1/2). But since we're taking the absolute value again, any negative part will be flipped.
- So the graph will have a V-shape where the original |x| was subtracted by 1/2, but then the absolute value ensures it's always positive. This creates a W shape, maybe? Or perhaps it's a V shape that's been shifted and reflected.

Wait, maybe I should think about key points. Let me plug in some values:

- f(0) = | |0| - 1/2 | = | -1/2 | = 1/2
- f(1/2) = | |1/2| - 1/2 | = |0| = 0
- f(1) = | |1| - 1/2 | = |1 - 1/2| = 1/2
- Similarly, for negative x, f(-1/2) = same as f(1/2) = 0

So the graph of f(x) touches zero at x = ±1/2 and has a maximum of 1/2 at x=0 and x=±1. So it's a V shape but with the bottom at 0 and peaks at 1/2. Wait, actually, that's a W shape. Hmm. So between x=-1/2 and x=1/2, f(x) goes from 1/2 down to 0 and back up to 1/2. Then from x=1/2 to x=1, it goes from 0 up to 1/2 again, and same for the negative side.

Wait, no. Let me plot it more carefully. For x between -1/2 and 1/2: |x| is less than 1/2, so |x| - 1/2 is negative, so the absolute value makes it 1/2 - |x|. So the graph is a V pointing upwards between -1/2 and 1/2, with the vertex at (0, 1/2). Then for x beyond ±1/2, |x| - 1/2 is positive, so f(x) = |x| - 1/2, which is a V pointing upwards but shifted right and left.

Wait, no. Actually, f(x) is ||x| - 1/2|. So for |x| >= 1/2, it's |x| - 1/2, which is a V shape with vertex at (0, -1/2), but since we take the absolute value, it becomes | |x| - 1/2 |, so for |x| >=1/2, it's |x| -1/2, which is positive, so that part is just a V that's been shifted up by 1/2? Hmm, this is a bit confusing. Maybe it's better to sketch it mentally.

Alternatively, perhaps I can sketch g(x) similarly.

g(x) = ||x| - 1/4|. So similar idea.

- g(0) = |0 - 1/4| = 1/4
- g(1/4) = |1/4 - 1/4| = 0
- g(1/2) = |1/2 - 1/4| = 1/4
- So between x=-1/4 and 1/4, g(x) is 1/4 - |x|, so a V pointing down, with vertex at (0,1/4). Then beyond x=±1/4, it's |x| - 1/4, which is a V pointing upwards.

Wait, no. For |x| <=1/4: |x| - 1/4 is negative, so the
