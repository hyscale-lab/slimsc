Okay, so I've got this problem here about b-eautiful numbers. Let me try to understand what it's asking for. 

So, given an integer b which is at least 2, a positive integer n is called b-eautiful if two conditions are met:

1. When n is expressed in base b, it has exactly two digits. That means in base b, n is written as something like "d1 d0", where d1 and d0 are digits in base b. So, d1 can't be zero because it's a two-digit number.

2. The sum of these two digits equals the square root of n. So, if the digits are d1 and d0, then d1 + d0 = sqrt(n).

The example given is that 81 is 13-eautiful because in base 13, 81 is written as 63 (since 6*13 + 3 = 81), and 6 + 3 = 9, which is sqrt(81). So, that makes sense.

The problem is asking for the least integer b (b >= 2) for which there are more than ten b-eautiful integers. So, we're looking for the smallest base b where the number of b-eautiful numbers n exceeds 10.

Alright, let's break this down.

First, let's represent n in base b. Since it's a two-digit number in base b, n can be written as:

n = d1 * b + d0

where d1 and d0 are digits in base b. Since it's a two-digit number, d1 must be at least 1 and at most b-1, and d0 must be between 0 and b-1.

The second condition is that the sum of the digits equals the square root of n:

d1 + d0 = sqrt(n)

But we can substitute n from the first equation into the second condition. So,

d1 + d0 = sqrt(d1 * b + d0)

Let me square both sides to eliminate the square root:

(d1 + d0)^2 = d1 * b + d0

Expanding the left side:

d1^2 + 2*d1*d0 + d0^2 = d1 * b + d0

Let's rearrange this equation to bring all terms to one side:

d1^2 + 2*d1*d0 + d0^2 - d1*b - d0 = 0

Hmm, that looks a bit complicated. Maybe we can reorganize terms in terms of d1 and d0. Let's see:

d1^2 + (2*d0 - b)*d1 + (d0^2 - d0) = 0

This is a quadratic equation in terms of d1, where d0 is a variable as well. Alternatively, maybe we can think of this equation in terms of d0 for a fixed d1 or vice versa.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to define s = d1 + d0. Then, the equation becomes:

s^2 = d1 * b + d0

But since s = d1 + d0, we can express d0 as s - d1. Substituting that into the equation:

s^2 = d1 * b + (s - d1)

Simplify the right side:

s^2 = d1 * b + s - d1

Bring all terms to one side:

s^2 - s = d1*(b - 1)

So,

d1 = (s^2 - s)/(b - 1)

But d1 must be an integer since it's a digit in base b, so (s^2 - s) must be divisible by (b - 1). Also, d1 must be at least 1 and at most b - 1.

Additionally, d0 = s - d1 must satisfy 0 <= d0 <= b - 1.

So, for each base b, we can consider s such that s^2 - s is divisible by b-1, and d1 is within the valid range, and d0 is within the valid range.

So, perhaps the plan is:

1. For each base b starting from 2 upwards, find all possible s such that (s^2 - s) is divisible by (b - 1). Then, for each such s, compute d1 and d0, and check if they are valid digits in base b.

2. If they are, then the number n = d1*b + d0 is b-eautiful.

3. Count how many such n exist for each b. We need to find the smallest b where the count exceeds 10.

Alternatively, perhaps think in terms of s.

Wait, let's think about s. Since s = d1 + d0, and d1 is between 1 and b-1, d0 is between 0 and b-1, so s ranges from 1 + 0 = 1 up to (b - 1) + (b - 1) = 2b - 2.

But s also must be equal to sqrt(n). Since n is a two-digit number in base b, n is at least b (since the smallest two-digit number in base b is 10_b = b) and at most (b-1)*b + (b-1) = b^2 - 1.

Thus, sqrt(n) is between sqrt(b) and sqrt(b^2 - 1), which is between roughly sqrt(b) and b - something small. So s must be an integer in that range.

Wait, but s must be an integer because it's the sum of two digits, which are integers. So s must be an integer such that s^2 is between b and b^2 - 1.

So, s must satisfy sqrt(b) <= s <= sqrt(b^2 -1). Since sqrt(b^2 -1) is just a bit less than b, and s must be integer, s can be from ceil(sqrt(b)) up to b -1.

Wait, for example, if b=2, then sqrt(b)=~1.414, so s can be 2. But since s = d1 + d0, and d1 is 1 (since in base 2, d1 can only be 1), and d0 can be 0 or 1. So
