Okay, so I've got this problem about a convex equilateral hexagon where all pairs of opposite sides are parallel. The triangle formed by extending sides AB, CD, and EF has sides of lengths 200, 240, and 300. I need to find the side length of the hexagon.

Hmm, let's break this down. First, the hexagon is convex and equilateral. That means all its sides are equal, but the angles can vary. Also, all pairs of opposite sides are parallel. So, if I label the hexagon ABCDEF, then AB is parallel to ED, BC is parallel to FE, and CD is parallel to AF. That's an important property because it suggests the hexagon could be thought of as being formed by translating sides or something.

Now, they mention that the triangle formed by extending AB, CD, and EF has sides of 200, 240, and 300. Let me visualize this. If I extend AB, CD, EF, these three lines will intersect to form a triangle. Since AB, CD, EF are sides of the hexagon, and the hexagon is convex, these extensions must meet outside the hexagon.

I remember that in such a setup, the hexagon can be thought of as part of a larger triangle, and the sides of the hexagon are related to the sides of this triangle through some scaling factor. Maybe similar triangles are involved here?

Wait, I think there's a concept called a "truncated triangle" or something like that. When you have a triangle and you truncate its corners by drawing lines parallel to the sides, you get a hexagon. Since our hexagon has opposite sides parallel, this might be exactly that scenario.

In this case, the triangle formed by extending the sides would be similar to the original triangle (if I imagine the hexagon as a truncation). But wait, the triangle given has sides 200, 240, 300. Let me check if that's a right triangle because 200, 240, 300 is a Pythagorean triple.

Calculating: 200² + 240² = 40000 + 57600 = 97600. 300² is 90000. Wait, that's not equal, so it's not a right triangle. Hmm, maybe I miscalculated. Let me check again.

Wait, 200² is 40,000, 240² is 57,600. Adding them gives 97,600. 300² is 90,000. So no, it's not a right triangle. That might complicate things.

But perhaps the triangle is similar to the hexagon's extensions. Let's think about the ratio. If the triangle's sides are 200, 240, 300, then the hexagon's side length might be a scaled version of these.

Wait, in the case of a truncated triangle, the hexagon's sides would be parallel to the original triangle's sides, and each side of the hexagon would be the same length, say
