Okay, so I have this problem here: I need to find the number of triples of nonnegative integers (a, b, c) such that a + b + c = 300, and another equation involving a, b, c: a²b + a²c + b²a + b²c + c²a + c²b = 6,000,000.

Hmm, let's start by understanding what the question is asking. We have two equations:

1. a + b + c = 300
2. a²b + a²c + b²a + b²c + c²a + c²b = 6,000,000

I need to find all nonnegative integer triples (a, b, c) that satisfy both equations.

First, maybe I can simplify the second equation. Let me look at it:

a²b + a²c + b²a + b²c + c²a + c²b.

I notice that each term is a product of two variables, one squared and the other linear. Maybe I can factor this expression somehow.

Let me try grouping terms:

= a²(b + c) + b²(a + c) + c²(a + b)

Yes, that makes sense. So it's a² times (b + c) plus b² times (a + c) plus c² times (a + b).

But from the first equation, a + b + c = 300, so b + c = 300 - a, a + c = 300 - b, and a + b = 300 - c.

So, substituting these into the second equation:

= a²(300 - a) + b²(300 - b) + c²(300 - c)

So the second equation becomes:

a²(300 - a) + b²(300 - b) + c²(300 - c) = 6,000,000.

Hmm, that's a bit simpler. So instead of dealing with cross terms, now each term is a function of a single variable.

But this still seems complicated because a, b, c are all variables. Maybe I can find a pattern or find symmetry. Alternatively, perhaps I can express this in terms of symmetric sums.

Wait, let's think about symmetric functions. The given equation is symmetric in a, b, c, so perhaps the solution might have some symmetry.

Alternatively, maybe we can express everything in terms of the sum a + b + c and the sum of squares or products.

Wait, let's denote S = a + b + c = 300.

Let me also compute the sum of squares: Let Q = a² + b² + c².

And maybe the sum of the products: Let P = ab + bc + ca.

Perhaps I can express the second equation in terms of Q and P.

Wait, let's see:

Our second equation is:

a²(300 - a) + b²(300 - b) + c
