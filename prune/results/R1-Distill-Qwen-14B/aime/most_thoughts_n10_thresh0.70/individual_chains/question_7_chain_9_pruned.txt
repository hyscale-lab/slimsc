Okay, so I'm trying to solve this probability problem involving a regular octagon. Let me try to understand what's being asked here.

The problem says: Each vertex of a regular octagon is independently colored either red or blue with equal probability. We need to find the probability that the octagon can be rotated such that all the blue vertices end up at positions where there were originally red vertices. The answer should be expressed as a fraction m/n where m and n are coprime, and then find m + n.

Hmm, okay. So, first, each vertex is colored red or blue, each with 50% chance. So, the total number of possible colorings is 2^8 = 256. That part is straightforward.

Now, the key is to find the number of colorings where there exists a rotation that maps all blue vertices to positions that were originally red. Let me think about what that means. So, in other words, for some rotation, every blue vertex in the original coloring should move to a position that was red in the original coloring.

Wait, maybe an alternative way to think about it: If we rotate the octagon by some number of steps, the set of blue vertices after rotation must be exactly the set of red vertices in the original coloring. Because the problem states that all blue vertices end up where there were originally red vertices. So, that implies that the rotated blue set is equal to the original red set.

But wait, let's clarify. Let me denote the original coloring as C. Then, after a rotation by k positions, the blue vertices in C become the images of the blue vertices under rotation. For this rotated coloring, we want every blue vertex to be where a red vertex was in the original C. So, the set of blue vertices after rotation is a subset of the original red vertices in C.

Wait, no, it's not a subset. Because the rotated blue set must exactly match the original red set. Because if you have a rotation that does that, then every blue vertex moves to a red vertex. So, the number of blue vertices must equal the number of red vertices in the original coloring. Because you can't have more blue vertices than red ones to map them all into red positions.

Wait, but the number of blue vertices can be 0, 1, 2, ..., 8. So, for a coloring with, say, 4 blue vertices, there must exist a rotation that maps those 4 blue vertices
