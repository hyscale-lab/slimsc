Okay, so Alice and Bob are playing this game where they take turns removing either 1 or 4 tokens from a stack of n tokens. Alice goes first, and whoever takes the last token wins. I need to find how many positive integers n â‰¤ 2024 make it possible for Bob to have a winning strategy, no matter how Alice plays.

Hmm, this sounds like a combinatorial game theory problem. I remember that in such games, positions can be classified as either winning or losing positions. A winning position is one where the current player can force a win regardless of what the opponent does, and a losing position is one where no matter what the current player does, the opponent can force a win.

So, in this case, let's define a position as losing if the player whose turn it is cannot force a win, assuming the opponent plays optimally. So, if Bob is to have a winning strategy, the starting position n must be a losing position for Alice. Because if Alice starts at a losing position, then Bob can always respond in a way that keeps Alice in losing positions until she can't move, thus Bob wins.

So, my first task is to figure out the pattern of losing positions for this game. Let's try to compute the losing positions for small n and see if a pattern emerges.

Let's start with n=1. If there's only 1 token, Alice takes it and wins. So, n=1 is a winning position for Alice. So, Bob can't win here.

n=2: Alice can take 1 token, leaving 1 for Bob. Then Bob is forced to take the last one and win. Wait, wait, no. Wait, if Alice takes 1 from 2, leaving 1, then Bob takes that 1 and wins. So Alice would lose if she does that. Alternatively, can Alice take 4 tokens? No, because n=2, she can't take 4. So she only can take 1. So, n=2: Alice takes 1, Bob takes 1 and wins. So, n=2 is a losing position for Alice. So Bob can win here.

Wait, wait, let me think again. When n=2, Alice's options are to take 1, leaving 1 for Bob. Then Bob takes 1 and wins. So Alice can't win, so n=2 is a losing position for Alice. So Bob can force a win when n=2.

Wait, this might be confusing. Let me clarify: positions where the current player can't force a win are losing positions. So, if n=2, the current player (Alice) can only take 1, leaving 1 for Bob. Then Bob can take 1 and win. So, yes, n=2 is a losing position for the current player, meaning Bob can win if n=2.

n=3: Alice can take 1, leaving 2. From n=2, we just saw that the next player (Bob) is in a losing position. So if Alice leaves Bob at n=2, then Bob is in a losing position, meaning Alice can win. So n=3 is a winning position for Alice.

Wait, but let me make sure. Alternatively, Alice could take 4 tokens, but n=3, so she can't. So her only option is to take 1. So she takes 1, leaving
