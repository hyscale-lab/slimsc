Okay, so I've got this geometry problem here. Let me try to visualize it and understand what's given and what's being asked.

We have triangle ABC inscribed in a circle ω. The tangents to ω at points B and C intersect at point D. Then, the line AD intersects ω again at point P. We're given the lengths AB = 5, BC = 9, and AC = 10. We need to find the length AP, express it as a reduced fraction m/n, and then find m + n.

First, let me try to draw a rough sketch of the situation. Triangle ABC with sides AB=5, BC=9, AC=10. It's inscribed in a circle, so ω is the circumcircle of triangle ABC. The tangent at B and tangent at C meet at point D. Then we draw AD, which intersects the circle again at P. So P is the second intersection point of AD with the circumcircle ω.

Since tangents from a common external point to a circle are equal, DB = DC. That might be useful later.

I remember that when dealing with tangents and circles, the power of a point theorem might come into play. The power of point D with respect to ω should be equal to DB² (since DB is the tangent from D to ω). Similarly, DC² is the same because DB = DC. But since D lies outside the circle, the power of D is also equal to DP * DA, because AD is a secant line intersecting ω at A and P.

Wait, no, actually, the power of point D should be equal to DB² = DC² = DP * DA. So that's a key equation here.

So, if I can find DB in terms of the sides of triangle ABC, then I can set up the equation DB² = DP * DA, which might help find AP, since AP = AD - DP or something like that.

But first, let's find some properties of triangle ABC. Given sides AB=5, BC=9, AC=10. Let me check whether this is a valid triangle. The sum of any two sides should be greater than the third. 5 + 9 =14 >10; 5 +10=15>9; 9 +10=19>5. So yes, it's valid.

I can compute the circumradius of triangle ABC using the formula:

R = (a*b*c)/(4*Δ)

where a, b, c are the sides, and Δ is the area.

So let's compute the area Δ of triangle ABC using Heron's formula.

First, compute the semi-perimeter, s = (5 + 9 +10)/2 = (24)/2 =12.

Then, Δ = sqrt[s(s - a)(s - b)(s - c)] = sqrt[12*(12-5)*(12-9)*(12-10)] = sqrt[12 *7 *3 *2] = sqrt[12*42] = sqrt[504].

Wait, let me compute that again:

12 -5 =7, 12-9=3, 12-10=2. So 12*7=84, 84*3=252, 252*2=504. So sqrt(504). Let me simplify sqrt(504):

504 = 16 * 31.5? Wait, 16*31.5 is 504? Wait, no. Let me factor 504 properly.

504 ÷ 2 = 252

252 ÷ 2 = 126

126 ÷ 2 =63

63 ÷3=21

21 ÷3=7

So 504=2^3 * 3^2 *7^1. So sqrt(504)=sqrt(2^3 *3^2 *7)=2^(1.5)*3*sqrt(7)=2*sqrt(2)*3*sqrt(7)=6*sqrt(14).

Wait, let me compute it step by step:

sqrt(504) = sqrt(16 * 31.5) is not helpful. Wait, 504=16*31.5? No, 16*31.5=504? Let's check: 16*30=480, 16*1.5=24, so 480+24=504. Oh yes, so sqrt(504)=sqrt(16*31.5)=4*sqrt(31.5). But sqrt(31.5) is sqrt(63/2)= (sqrt(63))/sqrt(2)= (3*sqrt(7))/sqrt(2). Hmm, perhaps it's better to leave it as sqrt(504) or factor it differently.

Wait, 504=72 *7. So sqrt(72*7)=sqrt(72)*sqrt(7)=6*sqrt(2)*sqrt(7)=6*sqrt(14). Oh, right! Because 72=36*2, so sqrt(72)=6*sqrt(2). So yeah, sqrt(504)=6*sqrt(14). So the area is 6*sqrt(14).

So, going back to the circumradius formula:

R = (a*b*c)/(4*Δ) = (5*9*10)/(4*6*sqrt(14)) = (450)/(24*sqrt(14)).

Simplify 450/24: both divisible by 6. 450 ÷6=75; 24 ÷6=4. So 75/(4*sqrt(14)).

Rationalize the denominator: 75/(4*sqrt(14)) = (75*sqrt(14))/(4*14) )= (75*sqrt(14))/56.

Hmm, so R is (75√14)/56. Not sure if that's necessary yet.

Now, let's think about point D. Since D is the intersection of the tangents at B and C, it's the ex-pole of BC.

Wait, or maybe use coordinates or inversion. Alternatively, perhaps we can use some properties of harmonic division or projective geometry, but perhaps that's too advanced.

Alternatively, maybe use power of point D.

Power of D with respect to ω is DB² = DC², which equals DP * DA.

So, if I can find DB, then I can find DP in terms of DA, and then find AP.

But how to find DB?

Let me recall that for a triangle, the distance from the external point D to the circle is related to the sides of the triangle.

Alternatively, perhaps using coordinates.

Let me try setting up coordinate system.

Let me place point C at (0,0), point A at (10,0), since AC=10 is a side. Then point B is somewhere in the plane.

Given that AB=5, BC=9.

So, coordinates:

A = (10, 0)

C = (0, 0)

B = (x, y) which we can find using the distances.

So, distance from B to A is 5: sqrt[(x-10)^2 + y^2] =5.

Distance from B to C is9: sqrt[x^2 + y^2] =9.

So, we have two equations:

(x-10)^2 + y^2 =25 ...(1)

x² + y² =81 ...(2)

Subtracting (1) - (2):

(x-10)^2 -x² =25 -81 → (x² -20x +100) -x² = -56 → -20x +100 =-56 → -20x= -156 → x= 156/20= 39/5=7.8.

So x=7.8=39/5.

Then from equation (2): x² + y²=81.

So, (39/5)^2 + y²=81.

Compute (39/5)^2: 39^2=1521, 5^2=25, so 1521/25.

So, y²=81 -1521/25.

Convert 81 to 2025/25.

So y²=2025/25 -1521/25= 504/25.

Thus, y= sqrt(504)/5= (6*sqrt(14))/5.

So, point B is at (39/5, 6√14/5).

So, coordinates:

A = (10,0)

B = (39/5, 6√14/5)

C = (0,0)

Now, we can find the equation of the tangent at B and tangent at C.

The tangent at a point on a circle is perpendicular to the radius at that point. So, if we can find the center O of the circle ω, then we can find the equations of the tangents at B and C.

So first, let's find the circumcenter O of triangle ABC.

The circumcenter is the intersection of the perpendicular bisectors of the sides.

We can compute it using coordinates.

Given points A(10,0), B(39/5, 6√14/5), C(0,0).

Let me denote O=(h,k). The circumcenter is equidistant from all three points. So,

OA² = OB² = OC².

Compute OA²: (10 - h)^2 + (0 -k)^2 = (10 -h)^2 +k².

OB²: (39/5 - h)^2 + (6√14/5 -k)^2.

OC²: h² +k².

Set OA² = OB²:

(10 -h)^2 +k² = (39/5 -h)^2 + (6√14/5 -k)^2.

Expand both sides:

Left: (100 -20h +h²) +k².

Right: ( (39/5)^2 - (78/5)h +h² ) + ( (6√14/5)^2 - (12√14/5)k +k² )

Compute each part:

(39/5)^2 = (1521)/25.

(6√14/5)^2 = (36*14)/25=504/25.

So, right side becomes:

[1521/25 - (78/5)h + h²] + [504/25 - (12√14/5)k +k²] = 1521/25 +504/25 - (78/5)h - (12√14/5)k +h² +k².

Simplify the constants: 1521 +504 = 2025; 2025/25=81.

So, right side: 81 - (78/5)h - (12√14/5)k +h² +k².

Left side: 100 -20h +h² +k².

Set left = right:

100 -20h +h² +k² =81 - (78/5)h - (12√14/5)k +h² +k².

Cancel h² and k² from both sides:

100 -20h =81 - (78/5)h - (12√14/5)k.

Bring all terms to left:

100 -20h -81 + (78/5)h + (12√14/5)k =0.

Simplify:

19 -20h + (78/5)h + (12√14/5)k=0.

Convert 20h to 100/5 h:

19 - (100/5 h) + (78/5 h) + (12√14/5)k=0.

Combine h terms:

19 - (22/5)h + (12√14/5)k=0.

Multiply both sides by 5 to eliminate denominators:

95 -22h +12√14 k=0.

So equation (a):  -22h +12√14 k = -95.

Now, set OA² = OC²:

OA² = (10 -h)^2 +k².

OC²= h² +k².

So,

(10 -h)^2 +k² = h² +k².

Simplify:

100 -20h +h² +k² =h² +k².

Cancel h² and k²:

100 -20h=0 → 20h=100 → h=5.

So, h=5.

Plug h=5 into equation (a):

-22*(5) +12√14 k =-95 → -110 +12√14 k =-95 → 12√14 k=15 → k=15/(12√14)=5/(4√14).

Rationalize denominator:

k=5/(4√14)= (5√14)/(4*14)=5√14/(56).

So, the circumcenter O is at (5, 5√14/56).

Wait, wait a second. Let me double-check that.

Wait, 12√14 k =15 → k=15/(12√14)=5/(4√14). Then rationalize:

Multiply numerator and denominator by √14: (5√14)/(4*14)=5√14/56.

Yes, correct.

So, O=(5, 5√14/56).

Now, knowing O, we can find the equations of the tangents at B and C.

First, the tangent at B: Since the tangent is perpendicular to the radius OB.

The slope of OB: (y_B - y_O)/(x_B - x_O).

Coordinates of B: (39/5, 6√14/5).

Coordinates of O: (5, 5√14/56).

Compute x_B - x_O = 39/5 -5= 39/5 -25/5=14/5.

y_B - y_O=6√14/5 -5√14/56= (6√14 *56 -5√14 *5)/(5*56).

Compute numerator: 6*56=336, so 336√14 -25√14= 311√14.

Denominator:5*56=280.

So, slope of OB: (311√14)/280 divided by 14/5.

Wait, wait, no. The slope is (y_B - y_O)/(x_B - x_O) = [ (6√14/5 - 5√14/56 ) ] / (14/5 ).

Let me compute numerator:

6√14/5 -5√14/56 = √14*(6/5 -5/56)=√14*( (6*56 -5*5)/(5*56) )=√14*(336 -25)/(280)=√14*(311)/280.

So, numerator is 311√14/280, denominator is 14/5.

So, slope of OB is (311√14/280) / (14/5) )= (311√14/280)*(5/14)= (311√14 *5)/(280*14).

Simplify: 5 and 280: 280=56*5, so 5 cancels with 280 to 56. 14 is 14.

So, (311√14)/(56*14) =311√14/(784).

So, slope of OB is 311√14/784.

Therefore, the tangent at B, which is perpendicular to OB, will have slope m1= -1/(slope of OB)= -784/(311√14).

Hmm, that's a bit messy, but let's see.

Similarly, the tangent at C: point C is (0,0). The slope of OC is (0 - y_O)/(0 - x_O)= (-y_O)/(-x_O)= y_O/x_O.

y_O=5√14/56, x_O=5.

So, slope of OC is (5√14/56)/5=√14/56.

Therefore, the tangent at C is perpendicular to OC, so its slope is -56/√14= -56√14/14= -4√14.

So, tangent at C has slope m2= -4√14.

Wait, let's see:

Slope of OC is (√14/56), so the slope of tangent is -1/(√14/56)= -56/√14= -56√14/14= -4√14. Yes, that's correct.

So, tangent at C is a line passing through (0,0) with slope -4√14. So, equation is y= -4√14 x.

Similarly, tangent at B: line passing through B(39/5,6√14/5) with slope m1= -784/(311√14).

Wait, that seems complicated. Maybe it's better to write the equation of tangent at B using the formula for tangent to a circle.

Alternatively, the equation of tangent at point (x1,y1) on circle (x - h)^2 + (y -k)^2 = R² is (x1 -h)(x -h) + (y1 -k)(y -k)= R².

Wait, no, the standard equation is (x1 - h)(x -h) + (y1 - k)(y -k) = R².

But wait, no, that's the equation of the circle. The tangent line equation is:

(x1 - h)(x - h) + (y1 - k)(y - k) = R².

Wait, no, actually, the equation is (x1 - h)(x - h) + (y1 - k)(y - k) = (x1 - h)^2 + (y1 - k)^2.

But since (x1,y1) is on the circle, (x1 -h)^2 + (y1 -k)^2=R², so the tangent equation simplifies to:

(x1 - h)(x - h) + (y1 - k)(y -k) = R².

So, for point B(39/5,6√14/5), the tangent at B is:

(39/5 -5)(x -5) + (6√14/5 - 5√14/56)(y -5√14/56) = R².

Compute 39/5 -5= (39-25)/5=14/5.

Compute 6√14/5 -5√14/56: same as earlier, which was 311√14/280.

So, the equation becomes:

(14/5)(x -5) + (311√14/280)(y -5√14/56) = R².

But R² is the square of the circumradius, which we can compute.

Wait, earlier we found R= (75√14)/56. So R²=(75^2 *14)/(56^2)= (5625*14)/(3136).

Let me compute that:

5625 *14=78750.

78750/(3136)= let's see, 3136*25=78400, so 78750-78400=350, so 25 + 350/3136=25 + 175/1568=25 + 25/224= approximately, but exact value is 78750/3136.

Wait, but maybe we can leave it as R²= (75^2 *14)/(56^2) = (5625 *14)/(3136).

But perhaps it's better to find R² in another way, using the formula we used earlier. Since R= (a b c)/(4Δ), and a=5, b=9, c=10, Δ=6√14.

So, R= (5*9*10)/(4*6√14)=450/(24√14)=75/(4√14). So R²= (75)^2/(4^2 *14)=5625/(16*14)=5625/224.

So, R²=5625/224.

So, returning to the tangent at B:

(14/5)(x -5) + (311√14/280)(y -5√14/56) =5625/224.

This seems complicated, but perhaps we can simplify the equation.

First, let's compute the coefficients:

14/5 is 2.8.

311√14/280≈ a number, but we might not need to approximate.

Let me write the equation as:

(14/5)(x -5) + (311√14/280)(y -5√14/56) =5625/224.

Multiply both sides by 280 to eliminate denominators:

14/5 * 280 (x -5) + 311√14 (y -5√14/56) =5625/224 *280.

Compute each term:

14/5 *280=14*56=784.

311√14 remains as is.

5625/224 *280=5625*(280/224)=5625*(5/4)=5625*1.25=7031.25.

Wait, 280/224=5/4, so 5625*(5/4)= (5625*5)/4=28125/4=7031.25.

Wait, but let's keep it as fractions.

5625/224 *280=5625*(280/224)=5625*(35/28)=5625*(5/4)= (5625*5)/4=28125/4.

So, the equation becomes:

784(x -5) +311√14(y -5√14/56)=28125/4.

Let me expand this:

784x -3920 +311√14 y - (311√14 *5√14)/(56)=28125/4.

Compute (311√14 *5√14)/56:

√14 *√14=14.

So, 311*5*14 /56 = (1555 *14)/56.

14/56=1/4, so 1555*(1/4)=1555/4.

So, the equation becomes:

784x -3920 +311√14 y -1555/4 =28125/4.

Bring constants to the right:

784x +311√14 y =3920 +1555/4 +28125/4.

Compute the constants:

3920= (3920*4)/4=15680/4.

So, 15680/4 +1555/4 +28125/4= (15680 +1555 +28125)/4.

Compute numerator:

15680 +1555=17235; 17235 +28125=45360.

So, 45360/4=11340.

So, the equation is:

784x +311√14 y=11340.

Hmm, that's the equation of the tangent at B.

Similarly, the tangent at C is y= -4√14 x.

So, point D is the intersection of these two tangents: the tangent at B (equation above) and tangent at C (y= -4√14 x).

So, substitute y= -4√14 x into the equation 784x +311√14 y=11340.

So,

784x +311√14*(-4√14 x)=11340.

Compute the term with y:

311√14*(-4√14 x)= -311*4*(√14)^2 x= -1244*14 x= -17416x.

So, equation becomes:

784x -17416x=11340 → (784 -17416)x=11340 → (-16632)x=11340.

So, x=11340/(-16632)= -11340/16632.

Simplify this fraction:

Divide numerator and denominator by 12: 11340 ÷12=945; 16632 ÷12=1386.

So, -945/1386.

Divide numerator and denominator by 3: 945 ÷3=315; 1386 ÷3=462.

Again, divide by 3: 315 ÷3=105; 462 ÷3=154.

So, now we have -105/154.

Check if they can be divided further: 105 and 154.

105=5*21=5*3*7.

154=14*11=2*7*11.

So, common factor is 7.

Divide numerator and denominator by7: 105 ÷7=15; 154 ÷7=22.

So, simplified fraction is -15/22.

So, x= -15/22.

Then, y= -4√14 x= -4√14*(-15/22)= (60√14)/22= (30√14)/11.

So, point D is at (-15/22, 30√14/11).

Now, we need to find the equation of line AD, which connects A(10,0) and D(-15/22,30√14/11).

Compute the slope of AD: (y_D - y_A)/(x_D -x_A)= (30√14/11 -0)/(-15/22 -10)= (30√14/11)/( -15/22 -220/22)= (30√14/11)/(-235/22)= (30√14/11)*(-22/235)= (-60√14)/235.

Simplify: -60 and 235 can both be divided by 5: -12√14/47.

So, slope m= -12√14/47.

Equation of AD: y -0= m(x -10).

So, y= (-12√14/47)(x -10).

We can write this as y= (-12√14/47)x + (120√14)/47.

Now, we need to find point P where AD meets the circumcircle ω again.

So, the parametric equation of AD can be written as:

x =10 + t*(-15/22 -10)=10 + t*(-235/22), but perhaps it's better to parameterize differently.

Alternatively, we can solve the system of equations: the equation of AD and the equation of the circumcircle.

But the equation of the circumcircle is (x -5)^2 + (y -5√14/56)^2 = R²=5625/224.

So, substitute y from AD's equation into the circumcircle's equation.

Let me write down:

y= (-12√14/47)x + 120√14/47.

Plug into the circle equation:

(x -5)^2 + ( (-12√14/47 x +120√14/47 -5√14/56 )^2 )=5625/224.

This seems complicated, but let's proceed step by step.

First, compute the terms:

Term1: (x -5)^2.

Term2: [ (-12√14/47 x +120√14/47 -5√14/56 ) ]^2.

Let me compute the expression inside the square:

Let me factor out √14:

√14 [ (-12/47 x +120/47 ) ] + (-5√14/56).

Wait, no, better to compute the constants:

Compute 120√14/47 -5√14/56.

Factor √14:

√14 (120/47 -5/56)=√14 [ (120*56 -5*47)/(47*56) ) ].

Compute numerator: 120*56=6720; 5*47=235.

6720 -235=6485.

Denominator:47*56=2632.

So, expression becomes:

√14*(6485/2632).

So, the entire expression inside the square is:

(-12√14/47 x ) + √14*(6485/2632)=√14 [ -12x/47 + 6485/2632 ].

Let me write the expression as √14*( a x + b ), but let's compute:

So, the expression is:

√14*( -12x/47 + 6485/2632 ).

Let me compute the coefficients:

-12/47 ≈-0.2553.

6485/2632≈2.463.

But let's keep it exact.

So, the term inside the square is √14*( -12x/47 + 6485/2632 ).

So, squaring this term: [√14*( -12x/47 + 6485/2632 )]^2=14*( (-12x/47 + 6485/2632 )^2.

So, going back to the circle equation:

(x -5)^2 + 14*( (-12x/47 + 6485/2632 )^2 )=5625/224.

This is a quadratic equation in x, and since A is on both AD and the circle, x=10 is a solution. The other solution will correspond to point P.

Let me denote u = x.

So,

(u -5)^2 +14*( (-12u/47 +6485/2632 )^2 =5625/224.

This seems very involved. Maybe there's a smarter approach.

Alternatively, since AD is a line passing through A(10,0) and D(-15/22,30√14/11), and we know A is on the circle. So, when we parametrize AD, the point P will be the second intersection point.

We can parametrize AD with parameter t, where t=0 corresponds to A(10,0), and t=1 corresponds to D(-15/22,30√14/11).

Wait, but then P is beyond D on the line AD. Wait, no: AD is from A to D, which is outside the circle, so the other intersection point P is between A and D.

Wait, actually, the line AD starts at A, goes through D, which is outside the circle, so the other intersection point P is between A and D.

So, parametrize AD as:

x =10 - (15/22 +10)*t =10 - (235/22)t.

Wait, no, perhaps better to parametrize from A to D.

The vector from A to D is D - A = (-15/22 -10, 30√14/11 -0)= (-235/22, 30√14/11).

So, parametric equations:

x=10 + (-235/22)t,

y=0 + (30√14/11)t,

where t=0 gives A, t=1 gives D.

We need to find t where (x,y) is on the circle.

So, substitute x and y into the circle equation.

Circle equation: (x -5)^2 + (y -5√14/56)^2 =5625/224.

Substitute x=10 - (235/22)t,

y=0 + (30√14/11)t.

So,

[10 - (235/22)t -5]^2 + [ (30√14/11)t -5√14/56 ]^2 =5625/224.

Simplify the terms:

First term: [5 - (235/22)t]^2.

Second term: [ (30√14/11)t -5√14/56 ]^2.

Factor √14 from the second term:

√14 [ (30/11)t -5/56 ].

So, the second term becomes (√14)^2 [ (30/11 t -5/56 ) ]^2=14*(30/11 t -5/56 )^2.

Now, write the equation:

[5 - (235/22)t]^2 +14*(30/11 t -5/56 )^2 =5625/224.

Let me compute each part.

First term: [5 - (235/22)t]^2.

Let me write 5 as 110/22, so 110/22 -235/22 t= (110 -235 t)/22.

So, [ (110 -235t)/22 ]^2= (110 -235t)^2 / (22)^2= (110 -235t)^2 /484.

Second term:14*(30/11 t -5/56 )^2.

Compute 30/11 t -5/56:

Find common denominator, which is 56*11=616.

30/11 t= (30*56 t)/616=1680 t/616.

5/56= (5*11)/616=55/616.

So, 30/11 t -5/56= (1680 t -55)/616.

So, squared: (1680 t -55)^2 / (616)^2.

Multiply by 14: 14*(1680t -55)^2 / (616)^2.

Note that 616=1680/2.642 approx, but exact value: 616=56*11.

Wait, 14*(1680t -55)^2 / (616)^2=14*(1680t -55)^2 / (56^2 *11^2)=14*(1680t -55)^2/(3136*121).

But 14 and 3136: 3136=14*224, so 14 cancels with denominator as 1/224.

So, second term becomes (1680t -55)^2 / (224*121)= (1680t -55)^2 /27104.

So, the equation now is:

(110 -235t)^2 /484 + (1680t -55)^2 /27104 =5625/224.

Multiply both sides by 27104*484 to eliminate denominators.

Compute 27104*484: 27104=16*1700 approx, but exact value: 27104=16*1700.25? Wait, perhaps factor:

27104 ÷16=1694, so 16*1694=27104.

484=22²=4*121.

So, LCM is 27104*484.

Wait, alternatively, multiply both sides by 27104*484:

Left side:

(110 -235t)^2 *27104 + (1680t -55)^2 *484 =5625/224 *27104 *484.

Compute each term:

First term: (110 -235t)^2 *27104.

Second term: (1680t -55)^2 *484.

Right side:5625/224 *27104 *484.

This is going to be a lot, but perhaps we can find t.

But let's note that t=0 is a solution because point A is on the circle. So, the equation will have a factor of t.

Let me denote the equation as:

[ (110 -235t)^2 *27104 + (1680t -55)^2 *484 ] =5625/224 *27104 *484.

Let me compute the right side first:

Compute 5625/224 *27104 *484.

First, compute 27104 /224= 27104 ÷224.

224*120=26880. 27104-26880=224. So, 224*121=27104. So, 27104=224*121.

So, 5625/224 *224*121 *484=5625 *121 *484.

Compute 5625 *121: 5625*100=562500; 5625*20=112500; 5625*1=5625. So, 5625*121=5625*(100+20+1)=562500+112500+5625=675000 +5625=680625.

Then, 680625 *484.

Compute 680625*484:

First, break down 484=400+80+4.

Compute 680625*400=272,250,000.

680625*80=54,450,000.

680625*4=2,722,500.

Sum them up:

272,250,000 +54,450,000=326,700,000.

326,700,000 +2,722,500=329,422,500.

So, right side=329,422,500.

Now, left side:

(110 -235t)^2 *27104 + (1680t -55)^2 *484.

Expand each term.

First term: (110 -235t)^2=110² -2*110*235 t + (235t)^2=12100 -51700t +55225t².

Multiply by 27104:

12100*27104= let's compute 12100*27104.

12100=121*100.

27104 *100=2,710,400.

27104 *121= ?

Compute 27104*100=2,710,400.

27104*20=542,080.

27104 *1=27,104.

Sum:2,710,400 +542,080=3,252,480; +27,104=3,279,584.

So, 12100*27104=121*27104*100= (3,279,584)*100=327,958,400.

Then, -51700t *27104= -51700*27104 t= let's compute 51700*27104.

51700=517*100.

517*27104: compute 500*27104=13,552,000; 17*27104=460,768. Total=13,552,000+460,768=14,012,768.

Multiply by 100: 1,401,276,800.

So, -51700*27104= -1,401,276,800 t.

Then, 55225t² *27104=55225*27104 t².

Compute 55225 *27104: let's compute 55,225 *27,104.

But this is getting too complicated. Maybe it's better to note that when t=0, the equation holds (as expected), so t must be a factor.

Alternatively, perhaps factor out t.

But given the complexity, maybe another approach is better.

Wait, perhaps instead of parametrizing, use power of a point.

We know that DB²=DP * DA.

We found DB: distance from D to B.

We have coordinates of D(-15/22, 30√14/11) and B(39/5,6√14/5).

Compute DB²= (x_D -x_B)^2 + (y_D - y_B)^2.

Compute x difference: (-15/22 -39/5)= (-15*5 -39*22)/(22*5)= (-75 -858)/110= (-933)/110.

y difference:30√14/11 -6√14/5= (30√14*5 -6√14*11)/(55)= (150√14 -66√14)/55=84√14/55.

So, DB²= [(-933/110)^2 + (84√14/55)^2].

Compute each term:

(-933/110)^2= (933)^2/(110)^2=870,489/12,100.

(84√14/55)^2= (84^2 *14)/(55^2)= (7056*14)/3025=98,784/3025.

Convert both to same denominator, which is 12,100.

870,489/12,100.

98,784/3025= (98,784*4)/12,100=395,136/12,100.

So, DB²= (870,489 +395,136)/12,100=1,265,625/12,100.

Simplify: 1,265,625 ÷25=50,625; 12,100 ÷25=484.

So, 50,625/484.

So, DB²=50,625/484.

So, power of point D: DB²=DP * DA.

We have DB²=50,625/484.

Now, DA is the distance from D to A.

Compute DA: distance between D(-15/22,30√14/11) and A(10,0).

Compute x difference:10 - (-15/22)=10 +15/22=235/22.

y difference:0 -30√14/11= -30√14/11.

So, DA²= (235/22)^2 + (30√14/11)^2.

Compute each term:

(235/22)^2= (235)^2/(22)^2=55,225/484.

(30√14/11)^2=900*14/(121)=12,600/121.

Convert to same denominator, 484:

55,225/484.

12,600/121= (12,600*4)/484=50,400/484.

So, DA²=55,225/484 +50,400/484=105,625/484.

Thus, DA= sqrt(105,625/484)= sqrt(105,625)/sqrt(484)=325/22.

So, DA=325/22.

So, DA=325/22, so DA= (325/22).

We have DB²=50,625/484= (225/22)^2.

Because 225²=50,625 and 22²=484.

So, DB=225/22.

So, power of point D: DB²= (225/22)^2=DP * DA.

We have DA=325/22, so:

(225/22)^2=DP*(325/22).

Solve for DP:

DP= (225/22)^2 / (325/22)= (225²)/(22²) * (22)/325= (225² *22)/(22² *325)= (225²)/(22 *325).

Simplify:

225²=50,625.

22*325=7,150.

So, DP=50,625 /7,150.

Simplify this fraction.

Divide numerator and denominator by 25: 50,625 ÷25=2,025; 7,150 ÷25=286.

So, 2,025/286.

Check if they can be divided further. 2,025 ÷13=155.769, not integer. 286 ÷13=22. So, 2,025 and 286 have no common factors besides 1.

So, DP=2,025/286.

Then, AP= DA - DP= (325/22) - (2,025/286).

Convert to same denominator: 286=22*13.

325/22= (325*13)/286=4,225/286.

So, AP=4,225/286 -2,025/286= (4,225 -2,025)/286=2,200/286.

Simplify 2,200 ÷286.

Divide numerator and denominator by 2:1,100/143.

Check if 1,100 and 143 have common factors.

143=11*13.

1,100 ÷11=100. So, 1,100=11*100; 143=11*13.

So, factor out 11: (11*100)/(11*13)=100/13.

So, AP=100/13.

So, m=100, n=13, which are coprime.

Thus, m +n=100 +13=113.


To solve the problem, we start by noting that point \( D \) is the intersection of the tangents to the circumcircle \( \omega \) of triangle \( ABC \) at points \( B \) and \( C \). By the power of a point theorem, the power of \( D \) with respect to \( \omega \) is \( DB^2 = DC^2 = DP \cdot DA \), where \( P \) is the second intersection of line \( AD \) with \( \omega \).

Given the side lengths \( AB = 5 \), \( BC = 9 \), and \( AC = 10 \), we first compute the circumradius \( R \) of triangle \( ABC \). Using Heron's formula, the area \( \Delta \) of \( ABC \) is found to be \( 6\sqrt{14} \). The circumradius \( R \) is then calculated as:

\[
R = \frac{abc}{4\Delta} = \frac{5 \cdot 9 \cdot 10}{4 \cdot 6\sqrt{14}} = \frac{450}{24\sqrt{14}} = \frac{75}{4\sqrt{14}}
\]

Next, we place the triangle in a coordinate system with \( C \) at the origin, \( A \) at \( (10, 0) \), and find the coordinates of \( B \) using the distance formula. Solving the system of equations derived from the distances \( AB = 5 \) and \( BC = 9 \), we find \( B \) at \( \left( \frac{39}{5}, \frac{6\sqrt{14}}{5} \right) \).

The circumcenter \( O \) is found by solving the perpendicular bisectors of \( AB \) and \( AC \), resulting in \( O = \left( 5, \frac{5\sqrt{14}}{56} \right) \). Using the circumcenter, we determine the equations of the tangents at \( B \) and \( C \), and find their intersection point \( D \) by solving these equations. The coordinates of \( D \) are found to be \( \left( -\frac{15}{22}, \frac{30\sqrt{14}}{11} \right) \).

Using the power of point \( D \), we calculate \( DB^2 \) and \( DA \). The distance \( DA \) is found to be \( \frac{325}{22} \), and \( DB^2 \) is \( \left( \frac{225}{22} \right)^2 \). Applying the power of point theorem:

\[
DB^2 = DP \cdot DA \implies \left( \frac{225}{22} \right)^2 = DP \cdot \frac{325}{22}
\]

Solving for \( DP \), we find \( DP = \frac{2025}{286} \). Finally, \( AP = DA - DP = \frac{325}{22} - \frac{2025}{286} = \frac{100}{13} \). Thus, \( AP \) can be written as \( \frac{100}{13} \), and \( m + n = 100 + 13 = 113 \).

\[
\boxed{113}
\]
