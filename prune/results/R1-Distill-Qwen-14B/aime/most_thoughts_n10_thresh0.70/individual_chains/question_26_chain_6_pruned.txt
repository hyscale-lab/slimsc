Okay, so I have this geometry problem here, and I need to find the length of AP in the given triangle setup. Let me try to break it down step by step.

First, the problem says that triangle ABC is inscribed in a circle ω. The tangents at B and C intersect at point D, and then the line AD intersects ω again at point P. We are given the lengths AB=5, BC=9, and AC=10. We need to find AP expressed as a reduced fraction m/n and then find m + n.

Alright, let's visualize this. Triangle ABC with AB=5, BC=9, AC=10. So, it's a scalene triangle. The tangents at B and C meet at D, which is the ex-pole of BC with respect to ω, I think. Then AD intersects ω again at P, so P is the second intersection point of AD with the circumcircle.

I remember that when two tangents are drawn from a point outside a circle, the lengths from that point to the points of tangency are equal. So, the tangent lengths from D to ω at B and C are equal. So, DB = DC. That might come in handy.

Hmm, we can probably use some properties of cyclic quadrilaterals or power of a point here. Since D is the intersection of two tangents, the power of D with respect to ω is DB² = DC². Also, since AD intersects ω at P, the power of D with respect to ω can also be expressed as DP * DA. So, maybe we can set up an equation using power of a point.

Let me write down the power of point D with respect to ω. The power is equal to DB² (since DB is the tangent length). Also, power is equal to DP * DA. So, DB² = DP * DA.

So, if I can find DB, and express DP in terms of DA, I can relate these. But I don't know DA or DP yet. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe I can find coordinates for the points and compute the intersection. That might be a bit involved, but perhaps manageable.

Wait, maybe I can use Menelaus' theorem or something similar on triangle ABC with transversal ADP? Not sure. Alternatively, using Ceva's theorem, but that involves concurrency.

Wait, perhaps using inversion. Inversion might simplify things, but I'm not sure if that's the right approach here.

Alternatively, since ABC is a triangle with known side lengths, I can compute its circumradius and other properties. Let me try that.

Given sides a=BC=9, b=AC=10, c=AB=5. Wait, let me confirm: in standard notation, a is BC, opposite angle A; but in the problem, AB=5, BC=9, AC=10. So, sides opposite angles: side AB=5 is opposite angle C, BC=9 is opposite angle A, AC=10 is opposite angle B.

Wait, maybe I should clarify that. But perhaps the standard notation is a=BC, b=AC, c=AB. So, a=9, b=10, c=5.

Wait, regardless,
