Okay, so I have this problem about a list of positive integers. Let me try to break it down and figure out step by step what each condition means and how to find the solution.

First, the problem states:

1. The sum of the items in the list is 30.
2. The unique mode of the list is 9.
3. The median of the list is a positive integer that does not appear in the list itself.

And the goal is to find the sum of the squares of all the items in the list.

Hmm, okay. Let me start by recalling some definitions to make sure I understand the terms.

- **Mode**: The mode is the number that appears most frequently in the list. "Unique mode" means that 9 appears more times than any other number in the list.
- **Median**: The median is the middle number when the list is ordered from smallest to largest. If there's an even number of items, it's the average of the two middle numbers. But the problem says the median is a positive integer that doesn't appear in the list. Interesting.

So, let me outline what I know:

- Sum = 30.
- Mode = 9, and it's unique, so 9 must appear more times than any other number.
- Median is an integer not in the list.

I need to find such a list and then compute the sum of the squares of its elements.

Let me think about the steps:

1. Determine the number of elements in the list. Let's denote it as n. Since the median is an integer, if n is odd, the median is the middle element; if n is even, it's the average of the two middle elements. But the median is an integer not in the list, so that might give me some clues about whether n is odd or even.

2. Since the mode is unique and is 9, 9 must appear more times than any other number. So, the count of 9s must be higher than the count of any other number.

3. The sum is 30, so the total of all numbers is 30.

Let me consider possible values of n.

Let's think about possible values of n.

First, n must be at least 1. But since the median is an integer not in the list, perhaps n is larger. Let me consider whether n is odd or even.

Case 1: n is odd.

If n is odd, the median is the (n+1)/2-th term. For example, if n=5, median is the 3rd term; if n=7, median is the 4th term, and so on.

But in this case, the median is a positive integer not in the list. So, the median is not in the list, but it's an integer. So, the median must be different from all elements in the list.

Wait, but the mode is 9, which is in the list. So, the median is another number not present in the list.

Case 2: n is even.

If n is even, the median is the average of the (n/2)-th and (n/2 +1)-th terms. For example, n=4, median is average of 2nd and 3rd terms. Since the median is an integer, that average must be an integer, which implies that the two middle numbers are both even or both odd. But again, the median is not in the list.

Hmm, this complicates things a bit. Let me try to figure out if n is odd or even.

Wait, perhaps it's better to approach this by trying to construct such a list.

Let me try small n first.

Let me think of possible n.

If n is 5: Let's see.

Wait, but with n=5, the median is the 3rd term, which is an integer not in the list. So, the 3rd term is some integer M not in the list. But wait, that's impossible because the list has 5 elements, so the 3rd term is part of the list. So, the median would
