Okay, let's try to tackle this problem step by step. So, Aya has a daily walk that's 9 kilometers long, and she stops at a coffee shop afterwards. The problem gives me two different scenarios with different walking speeds and the time it takes, including the time she spends in the coffee shop. I need to find out how long her walk will take if she walks at a speed that's s plus a half kilometers per hour, and include the t minutes she spends in the coffee shop.

Hmm, first, let me parse the information given. When she walks at a constant speed of s km/h, the total time, which includes walking plus the coffee shop time, is 4 hours. Then, when she increases her speed to s + 2 km/h, the total time becomes 2 hours and 24 minutes. I need to find the time when her speed is s + 1/2 km/h.

Wait, so in both cases, the distance is the same, 9 km, but the walking speed changes, which affects the time she spends walking. The total time includes t minutes in the coffee shop, which is a constant in both cases. So, the difference in total time is due to the difference in walking time.

Let me write down the given information:

1. When speed is s km/h, total time = 4 hours = 240 minutes. This includes walking time plus t minutes.

2. When speed is (s + 2) km/h, total time = 2 hours 24 minutes = 144 minutes. Again, includes walking time plus t minutes.

I need to find the total time when speed is (s + 1/2) km/h, which will be walking time plus t minutes.

So, the approach here is to find the values of s and t. Once I have those, I can compute the walking time at s + 1/2 km/h and add t minutes to get the total time.

Let me denote:

- Walking time at speed s: distance = speed × time, so 9 = s × t_walk1. So t_walk1 = 9/s hours.

Similarly, when speed is s + 2, t_walk2 = 9/(s + 2) hours.

But the total time includes t minutes, which is a constant. Wait, but the total times given are in hours, and t is in minutes. So I need to make sure the units are consistent.

Wait, perhaps it's better to convert everything into hours.

So, t minutes is t/60 hours.

So, the first scenario:

t_walk1 + t/60 = 4 hours.

Similarly, the second scenario:

t_walk2 + t/60 = 2 + 24/60 = 2.4 hours.

Wait, 24 minutes is 24/60 = 0.4 hours, so 2 hours 24 minutes is 2.4 hours.

So, writing equations:

1. (9/s) + (t/60) = 4.

2. (9/(s + 2)) + (t/60) = 2.4.

Hmm, so I have two equations with two variables, s and t. I can solve this system.

Let me subtract
