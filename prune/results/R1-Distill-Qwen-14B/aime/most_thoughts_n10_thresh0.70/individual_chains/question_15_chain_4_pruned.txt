Okay, so I've got this problem here about counting the number of paths on an 8x8 grid. The paths are from the lower left corner to the upper right corner, and they have to be of length 16. Plus, they have to change direction exactly four times. Hmm, okay, let me try to unpack this.

First, I remember that in a grid, moving from the lower left to the upper right usually involves moving right and up. Since it's an 8x8 grid, to get from the start to the end, you have to move 8 steps to the right and 8 steps up, right? So total steps would be 16, which matches the path length given. So that part makes sense.

Now, the problem is about paths that change direction exactly four times. I'm a bit confused about what exactly constitutes a direction change. Let me think. If you're moving along the grid, you can either go right or up. Each time you switch from right to up or up to right, that's a direction change. So, for example, if you go right, right, up, up, right, right, up, up, that's a change from right to up, then up to right, then right to up. So that's three direction changes. Wait, but in that case, how does that relate to the number of segments?

Each time you change direction, you start a new segment. So, if you change direction four times, how many segments does that make? Let's see, starting direction is either right or up. Each direction change starts a new segment. So, four direction changes would result in five segments. Because the first segment is one, then each change adds another. So, 1 + 4 = 5 segments.

Wait, let me test this. If you have one direction change, you have two segments. For example, right then up. So, that's two segments. So, yes, direction changes plus one gives the number of segments. So four direction changes would be five segments.

Now, each segment is a straight line, either all right or all up. So, each segment consists of some number of right steps or up steps. But how do these segments add up to the total required steps?

In total, we need 8 right steps and 8 up steps. So, the sum of the lengths of the right segments should be 8, and similarly for the up segments. Also, since the path starts and ends with a certain direction, the number of segments in each direction might differ, but in total, they should add up correctly.

Wait, but how does the number of segments relate to the number of direction changes? Since each direction change flips between right and up, the number of right segments and up segments must differ by at most one. Because if you start with right, then up, then right, and so on, you'll have one more right segment than up if the number of direction changes is even. Or vice versa if it's odd.

Wait, let's see. Four direction changes would be even. So, if you start with right, then you go up, then right, then up, then right. So, that's five segments: right, up, right, up, right. So, three right segments and two up segments. Alternatively, if you start with up, you'd have three up segments and two right segments.

So, depending on the starting direction, you'll have either three right segments and two up segments or three up segments and two right segments. So, each direction will have either three or two segments.

But in total, the number of right segments plus up segments is five. So, regardless, each direction has either two or three segments.

Now, the problem is to count all such paths where the number of direction changes is four. So, for each starting direction, we'll have to compute the number of ways to split the 8 right steps into either three or two segments, and similarly for the up steps into two or three segments.

Wait, so let me formalize this.

Case 1: The path starts with a right move.

In this case
