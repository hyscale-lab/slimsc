Okay, so I've got this problem about coloring the vertices of a regular octagon either red or blue, each with equal probability. The question is about finding the probability that after coloring, there exists a rotation of the octagon such that all the blue vertices end up where the red ones were originally. The answer needs to be in the form of a reduced fraction m/n, and then we have to find m + n.

Hmm, let me try to break this down. First, the octagon is regular, so it has eight vertices, each of which can be colored either red or blue with a 50% chance each. So, the total number of possible colorings is 2^8, which is 256. That part is straightforward.

Now, the key part is figuring out how many colorings satisfy the condition that there's a rotation that maps all blue vertices to where there were originally red ones. Let me think about what this condition implies.

Let me denote the original coloring as C, and the rotated coloring as C'. The problem states that for some rotation, every blue vertex in C' was red in C. So, in other words, if I rotate the octagon by some number of positions, all the blue vertices in the new position (C') correspond to red vertices in the original (C). 

Wait, actually, let me make sure I get that correctly. The question says, "all of the blue vertices end up at positions where there were originally red vertices." So the blue vertices after rotation must be in positions that were red before. So, that would mean that in the original coloring, those positions are red, and after rotation, the blue vertices are exactly those positions. So, the set of blue vertices in the rotated octagon must be a subset of the red positions in the original.

But wait, actually, no. Because when you rotate, the colors move. So, if I have a coloring C, and I rotate it by k positions to get C', then for each vertex i, the color in C' at position i is the color of position (i - k) mod 8 in C.

So, the condition is that for some rotation k, every blue vertex in C' was red in C. Wait, that would mean that for each i, if C' has a blue at i, then C has red at (i - k) mod 8.

Alternatively, for the coloring C, if you rotate it by k, then all the blue vertices in the rotated version are at positions where C had red. So, the set of blue vertices in C' is a subset of the red vertices in C.

Wait, but the problem says "all of the blue vertices end up at positions where there were originally red vertices." So, that would be that the blue vertices in C' are exactly a subset of the red positions in C. But perhaps more precisely, for each blue vertex in C', the corresponding position in C was red. So, for all i, if C' has blue at i, then C has red at (i - k) mod 8.

So, in other words, the set S' of blue vertices in C' must be a subset of the set S of red vertices in C, but shifted by k. Wait, no, because shifting is rotation, so it's a permutation of the positions.

Alternatively, perhaps
