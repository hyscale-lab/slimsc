Okay, so I have this math problem here, and I'm supposed to figure it out. Let me read it again and try to break it down.

Alice chooses a set A of positive integers. Then Bob lists all finite nonempty sets B of positive integers with the property that the maximum element of B belongs to A. Bob's list has 2024 sets. I need to find the sum of the elements of A.

Hmm, okay. Let me try to understand what's going on here.

First, Alice picks a set A. Then Bob creates a list of all finite nonempty sets B where each B has its maximum element in A. So, each set B is a finite nonempty set of positive integers, and the largest number in B is in A. The total number of such sets B is 2024. And from that, I have to find the sum of elements in A.

Alright, so maybe I can model this. Let me think about how the number of such sets B relates to the set A.

Each finite nonempty set B is a subset of some positive integers. The maximum element in B is in A. So, suppose A is {a1, a2, ..., an}, where a1 < a2 < ... < an.

Then, any set B that Bob lists must have its maximum element equal to one of these ai's. And for each ai, how many sets B have maximum ai? Well, for each ai, any such set B would consist of any nonempty subset of {1, 2, ..., ai} where the maximum is ai. Wait, no, that's not right. Because the elements in B can be any positive integers, but their maximum is ai.

Wait, actually, B can be any set of positive integers where the maximum is in A. So, for each ai in A, the number of sets B with maximum ai is equal to the number of subsets of {1, 2, ..., ai} that include ai. Because if the maximum is ai, all elements must be less than or equal to ai, and ai must be present.

So, the number of subsets of {1, 2, ..., ai} that include ai is 2^{ai -1}. Because for each of the other ai -1 elements, you can choose whether to include them or not, and you must include ai. So, for each ai, there are 2^{ai -1} such sets B.

Therefore, the total number of sets B that Bob can list is the sum over each ai in A of 2^{ai -1}.

Given that the total number of such sets is 2024, we have:

Sum_{ai in A} 2^{ai -1} = 2024.

So, our equation is:

2^{a1 -1} + 2^{a2 -1} + ... + 2^{ak -1} = 2024,

where {a1, a2, ..., ak} is the set A, and a1 < a2 < ... < ak.

We need to find A such that the sum of 2^{ai-1} equals 2024, and then compute the sum of the ai's.

So, the problem reduces to expressing 2024 as a sum of distinct powers of 2 multiplied by 2^{0}, because 2^{ai-1} is a power of 2.

Wait, 2^{ai -1} is equal to 2^{n} where n = ai -1. So, each term is a power of 2. So, 2024 is being expressed as a sum of distinct powers of 2. But wait, 2024 can be written in binary as a sum of distinct powers of 2.

But let me check: 2024 in binary is... Let's compute that.

2024 divided by 2: 1012, remainder 0.

1012 /2 = 506, rem 0

506 /2=253 rem 0

253/2
