Okay, so I have this problem about a tetrahedron ABCD. The edges are given with specific lengths: AB and CD are √41, AC and BD are √80, and BC and AD are √89. I need to find the distance from the incenter I to each face, and express it in the form m√n/p, then find m + n + p.

Hmm, tetrahedron with opposite edges equal. That seems symmetric. Maybe it's a kind of isosceles tetrahedron? I've heard of something called a "disphenoid," which is a tetrahedron where opposite edges are equal. So I think this is a disphenoid. That should have some nice properties.

In a disphenoid, all four faces are congruent triangles, right? Wait, no, not necessarily. Wait, maybe not all faces, but maybe opposite faces are congruent. Let me think. In a disphenoid, opposite edges are equal, and the four faces are congruent. So, if that's the case, then each face is congruent to the others. So, all faces are congruent triangles. That might help because then the volume and other properties can be calculated more easily.

But wait, let me verify. The edges are AB=CD, AC=BD, BC=AD. So, edges opposite each other are equal. So yes, it's a disphenoid. In a disphenoid, the faces are congruent, so each face is congruent to the others. So, all four faces are congruent triangles.

So, each face has sides of lengths √41, √80, and √89? Wait, no. Because for each face, the edges would be combinations of AB, AC, BC, etc. Let's see: Take face ABC, its edges are AB, AC, and BC. So AB is √41, AC is √80, BC is √89. Similarly, the face ABD would have edges AB, AD, BD. AB is √41, AD is √89, BD is √80. So yes, each face has edges √41, √80, √89. So that means all four faces are congruent triangles with sides √41, √80, √89.

So, that's helpful. So, each face is a triangle with sides √41, √80, √89. So, the area of each face is the same. Let me calculate the area of one face first. Let's pick triangle ABC.

To find the area, I can use Heron's formula. The sides are a = √41, b = √80, c = √89.

First, compute the semi-perimeter, s = (a + b + c)/2. But wait, since the sides are square roots, calculating s might get messy. Maybe there's a better way. Alternatively, since all sides are square roots, perhaps it's a right triangle? Let me check.

Is (√41)^2 + (√80)^2 equal to (√89)^2? 41 + 80 is 121, which is 11^2, not 89. So, no, it's not a right triangle. Hmm. So, I need to compute the area using Heron's formula.

But Heron's formula can be tricky with square roots. Maybe instead of computing s, I can compute the area using vectors or coordinates? Alternatively, I can use the formula for area in terms of side lengths.

Wait, Heron's formula is Area = √[s(s - a)(s - b)(s - c)], where s is the semi-perimeter.

Let me compute s:

s = (√41 + √80 + √89)/2.

Hmm, that's a bit complicated. Maybe I can compute s squared or something else? Alternatively, maybe it's better to assign coordinates to the tetrahedron to compute the volume and then find the inradius.

Wait, but the inradius formula for a tetrahedron is similar to the inradius in a triangle. In a triangle, the inradius is area divided by semi-perimeter. For a tetrahedron, it's 3 times volume divided by the surface area.

Wait, yes, in a tetrahedron, the inradius r is given by r = 3V / A_total, where V is the volume and A_total is the total surface area.

Since all four faces are congruent, the total surface area is 4 times the area of one face. So, if I can compute the area of one face and the volume, I can find r.

So, first, let's compute the area of one face.

Let me go back to triangle ABC with sides a =
