Okay, so I've got this math problem to solve, and I'm a bit stuck but I'll try to work through it step by step. The problem is about counting the number of paths on an 8x8 grid. The paths go from the lower left corner to the upper right corner, have a length of 16, and change direction exactly four times. Hmm, let me think about this.

First, I remember that in grid path problems, moving from one corner to the opposite usually involves moving right and up. For an 8x8 grid, to get from the lower left to the upper right, you need to move 8 steps to the right and 8 steps up, totaling 16 steps. So each path is a sequence of rights and ups, in some order.

Now, without any restrictions, the number of such paths is the combination of 16 steps taken 8 at a time, since you choose 8 steps to be right (or up). That would be C(16,8), which is 12,870. But this problem adds a constraint: the path must change direction exactly four times.

Wait, changing direction exactly four times... Hmm. So, what does that mean? Each time the direction changes, it's from right to up or up to right. So, for each path, the number of direction changes is one less than the number of runs of consecutive steps in the same direction.

Wait, no. Let me clarify that. If I'm moving in one direction, then change to another, that's one change. So, the total number of direction changes is equal to the number of times the direction switches. So, for example, if a path goes right, right, up, up, right, right, up, up, etc., each switch from right to up or up to right counts as a direction change.

So, if a path has four direction changes, how many segments (runs) of consecutive steps does it have? Well, each direction change increases the number of segments by one. Starting with one segment, each change adds another. So, four direction changes would mean five segments.

Wait, no. Let me think again. Suppose I start moving right, then change to up, that's one change, so two segments. Another change would make three segments. So, yes, four direction changes mean five segments in total
