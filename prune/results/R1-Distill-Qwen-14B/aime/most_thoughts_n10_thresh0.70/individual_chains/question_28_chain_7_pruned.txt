Okay, so I have this problem about a tetrahedron ABCD with specific edge lengths, and I need to find the distance from a point inside the tetrahedron to each of its faces. The distance is supposed to be equal for all faces, and the answer should be in a particular form. Hmm, I remember that in a tetrahedron, the point equidistant from all faces is called the incenter, similar to the incenter in a triangle. So, I think I need to find the inradius of this tetrahedron.

First, let me note down the given edge lengths:

- AB = CD = √41
- AC = BD = √80
- BC = AD = √89

So, the tetrahedron has opposite edges equal. That seems symmetrical in some way. Maybe it's a kind of isosceles tetrahedron? I think such tetrahedrons are called "equifacial" or "isohedral," but I'm not entirely sure. Anyway, symmetry might help here.

I remember that for a tetrahedron, the formula for the inradius (r) is volume (V) divided by the surface area (A), similar to how the inradius of a triangle is area divided by semiperimeter. So, r = 3V / A, where A is the total surface area. Wait, no, in a tetrahedron, the surface area is the sum of the areas of all four faces, and the formula for the inradius is V divided by (A/3), since each face contributes to the total surface area. So, maybe r = 3V / A_total. Wait, I should double-check that.

Let me think: in a triangle, the inradius is area divided by semiperimeter. In 3D, the analogous formula for the inradius is volume divided by the surface area times 3, because each face contributes a kind of "area" that the inradius relates to. So, yes, r = 3V / A_total. So, I need to find the volume and the total surface area.

But before that, I should figure out if the tetrahedron is regular or not. It's not regular because the edges are of different lengths: √41, √80, √89. So, it's a irregular tetrahedron but with some symmetry because opposite edges are equal. That might help in calculating volume.

Wait, since opposite edges are equal, maybe this is a kind of "equilic" tetrahedron or something similar. I think in such cases, the volume might be easier to compute because of the symmetry.

Alternatively, perhaps we can place the tetrahedron in a coordinate system in such a way that the coordinates of the vertices can be determined, making it easier to calculate the volume and other properties.

Let me try that approach. Let me assign coordinates to the vertices. Let's place point A at (0, 0, 0). Then, perhaps we can place point B at (x, 0, 0), point C at (0, y, 0), and point D at (0, 0, z). But
