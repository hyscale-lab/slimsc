Okay, so I've got this problem about placing chips on a 5x5 grid. There are 25 white chips and 25 black chips, but they're indistinguishable except for their color. The goal is to figure out how many ways there are to place some of these chips in the grid following certain rules.

Let me break down the conditions again to make sure I understand them correctly.

First, each cell can have at most one chip. So no two chips can be in the same cell. That part is straightforward.

Second, all chips in the same row must be the same color, and all chips in the same column must also be the same color. So, for example, if I place a white chip in a particular row, every other chip in that row must also be white. Similarly, if a column has a white chip, all the others in that column must be white too.

Third, any additional chip placed would violate one or more of the previous two conditions. That means the placement must be such that adding another chip isn't possible without breaking the row or column color rules. So the configuration is maximal in some sense.

Hmm, okay. Let me think about how to model this. Since each row must have all chips of the same color, each row is either all white, all black, or empty. Similarly, each column must be all white, all black, or empty. Wait, no, actually, if a row is non-empty, all its chips must be the same color. Similarly for columns.

But wait, that's not possible for both rows and columns unless the entire grid is monochromatic or has a checkerboard pattern. Wait, no, maybe that's not necessarily the case. Let me think.

Suppose we have a row that's all white. Then, in each column that intersects this row, the column can't have any black chips, because the row's white. So the columns must also be all white. But that can't be, because some columns might only have white chips, while others might have black. Hmm, this is getting a bit confusing.

Wait, maybe each row can be independently chosen to be white or black, but if a row is non-empty, it must be all white or all black, and similarly for columns. But then, the constraints from rows and columns have to be compatible.

Wait, perhaps the only possible configurations are grids where each row and each column is either all white, all black, or empty. But
