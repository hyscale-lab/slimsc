Okay, so I have this problem about a torus and a sphere. The torus is created by revolving a circle with radius 3 around an axis that's in the same plane as the circle, but 6 units away from the center. So it's like a donut shape. The sphere has a radius of 11. 

The question is about when the torus is resting on the inside of the sphere and when it's resting on the outside. In each case, they are tangent along a circle, and we need to find the radii of these circles, r_i and r_o, respectively. Then, calculate the difference r_i - r_o and express it as a reduced fraction m/n, and find m + n.

Hmm, I think I should start by visualizing the torus. A torus can be thought of as having two radii: the major radius R, which is the distance from the center of the generating circle to the axis of revolution, and the minor radius r, which is the radius of the generating circle itself. In this case, the minor radius is 3, and the major radius is 6 because the axis is 6 units away from the center of the circle.

So, R = 6, r = 3.

Now, the sphere has a radius of 11, so its center is at some point, but when the torus is inside or outside, it's tangent to the sphere. I need to find the circles of tangency in both cases.

First, when the torus is inside the sphere, it's tangent along a circle. Similarly, when it's outside, it's tangent along another circle. I think the key here is to consider the centers of these tangent circles and figure out their radii.

Let me think about the torus inside the sphere. The torus is sitting inside the sphere, touching it along a circle. The sphere's center is at the origin, let's assume, and the torus's center (the center of the generating circle) is at some point. Wait, actually, the torus is a surface of revolution, so its center is at the axis of revolution. Since the sphere is symmetric, I can probably model this in a coordinate system.

Maybe I should place the torus such that its axis of revolution is along the x-axis. So the center of the generating circle is at (R, 0, 0) = (6, 0, 0), and the generating circle has radius r = 3. So the torus is the set of all points at a distance r from the circle of radius R around the origin.

Wait, no. The torus is created by revolving a circle of radius 3 around an axis that's 6 units away. So the center of the generating circle is 6 units from the axis, right? Wait, no. The generating circle is revolved around an axis in its plane, 6 units away. So the generating circle is in a plane, say the xy-plane, and the axis is along the x-axis at y=0, but the generating circle is centered at (6, 0), right? Because the axis is 6 units from the center. So the generating circle has center at (6, 0), radius 3.

Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me clarify.

The torus is formed by rotating a circle (radius 3) around an external axis. The axis is in the same plane as the circle and is 6 units from the center of the circle. So if the circle is in the xy-plane, centered at (0, 0), then the axis is the line y = 6, but that can't be right because the axis should be in the plane of the circle. Wait, no, the axis is in the plane of the circle, so if the circle is in the xy-plane, the axis must be along, say, the x-axis or y-axis.

Wait, perhaps the circle is centered at (0, 0), and the axis is the line
