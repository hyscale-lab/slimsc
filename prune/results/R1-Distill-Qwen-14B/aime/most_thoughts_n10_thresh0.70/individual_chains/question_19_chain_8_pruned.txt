Okay, so I have this geometry problem about triangle ABC. The given information is that the circumradius is 13, the inradius is 6, and IA is perpendicular to OI. I need to find AB multiplied by AC.

First, let me recall some concepts. The circumradius (R) is the radius of the circumscribed circle around the triangle, and the inradius (r) is the radius of the inscribed circle. The circumcenter (O) is the intersection point of the perpendicular bisectors of the triangle, while the incenter (I) is where the angle bisectors meet.

Given that IA is perpendicular to OI, that seems like an important condition. Maybe I can use some properties or formulas related to the inradius, circumradius, and their positions relative to each other.

I remember that in any triangle, the distance between the incenter and circumcenter can be found using the formula:

OI² = R(R - 2r)

Where OI is the distance between O and I, R is the circumradius, and r is the inradius. Let me plug in the given values:

OI² = 13(13 - 2*6) = 13(13 -12) = 13*1 =13

So OI is sqrt(13). But wait, the problem says IA is perpendicular to OI. Hmm, so IA is perpendicular to OI. That must mean that the line IA forms a right angle with the line OI.

Maybe I can visualize this. Let me think: In triangle ABC, O is the circumcenter, and I is the incenter. IA is one of the internal angle bisectors from A to the inradius. So, if IA is perpendicular to OI, perhaps there's a right triangle involved here.

Wait, perhaps I can consider triangle OIA. Since IA is perpendicular to OI, triangle OIA is a right-angled triangle at I. So, in triangle OIA, angle at I is 90 degrees. So by Pythagoras theorem, OA² = OI² + IA².

But OA is the circumradius, which is 13. So,

13² = (sqrt(13))² + IA²
169 = 13 + IA²
IA² = 169 -13 = 156
IA = sqrt(156) = 2*sqrt(39)

Hmm, so IA is 2*sqrt(39). I wonder if that helps.

I also know that in a triangle, the length of the inradius can be found using r = (Area)/(semiperimeter). But I don't know the semiperimeter or the area yet. Maybe I can find those.

Alternatively, I remember that the distance from the incenter to a vertex can be expressed in terms of the triangle's sides. Specifically, the formula for IA is:

IA = sqrt(r² + (s - a)²)

Where s is the semiperimeter, and a is the side opposite vertex A, which is BC.

Wait, let me check that formula. I think IA can be expressed in terms of the inradius and the ex-radius or something like that.

Alternatively, another formula I recall
