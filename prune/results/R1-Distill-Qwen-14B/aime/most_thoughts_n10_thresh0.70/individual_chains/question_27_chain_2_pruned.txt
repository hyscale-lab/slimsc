Okay, so I've got this math problem here about a torus and a sphere. Hmm, let's see. I need to find the difference between two radii, r_i and r_o, where r_i is the radius of the circle where the torus is internally tangent to the sphere, and r_o is the same but for external tangency. Then, express the difference as a fraction m/n and find m + n.

Alright, first, let me recall what a torus is. A torus is like a donut shape, right? It's formed by rotating a circle around an axis that's in the same plane as the circle but doesn't intersect it. So in this case, the circle has a radius of 3, and the distance from the center of the circle to the axis of rotation is 6. That means the "big radius" (the distance from the center of the tube to the center of the torus) is 6, and the "small radius" (the radius of the tube itself) is 3.

Now, the sphere S has a radius of 11. So, when the torus is resting inside the sphere, it's tangent along a circle, and when it's outside, it's tangent along another circle. My goal is to find the radii of these circles, r_i and r_o, and then compute their difference.

Let me visualize this. When the torus is inside the sphere, the sphere's surface touches the torus at a circle. Similarly, when it's outside, the sphere touches the torus at another circle. I need to find the radii of these circles.

I think the key here is to find the points where the torus and sphere are tangent. For internal tangency, the sphere is larger, so the torus is entirely inside, touching the sphere along a circle. For external tangency, the torus is outside, but touches the sphere at another circle.

Let me think about the geometry of the situation. The torus can be represented in 3D coordinates with its center at the origin. Its equation is probably something like (sqrt(x^2 + y^2) - R)^2 + z^2 = r^2, where R is the big radius (6) and r is the small radius (3). So, yes, the equation would be (sqrt(x^2 + y^2) - 6)^2 + z^2 = 9.

The sphere S has a radius of 11. When the torus is inside S, the distance between their centers must be equal to the difference in their radii. Similarly, when the torus is outside, the distance between centers is equal to the sum of their radii. Wait, no, that might not be directly applicable because the torus is a surface, not a solid sphere.

Wait, actually, no. The sphere is solid, and the torus is a surface. So when the torus is inside the sphere, the sphere's radius is larger, so the sphere touches the torus at a single circle. Similarly, when the torus is outside, the sphere has to just reach the torus's outermost point, which is a circle.

I think a better approach is to model the point of tangency. Let's consider the point where the sphere and torus are tangent. At that point, their normals must be the same. So, if I can find the point where their gradients are colinear, that might give me the condition needed to find r_i and r_o.

Alternatively, maybe there's a way to parameterize the torus and the sphere, and find where they intersect in a circle, then find the radius of that circle.

Wait, let me think differently. The torus is a surface of revolution, so all points on the torus are at a distance that depends on their angular position around the axis. Similarly, the sphere is also a surface of revolution. Perhaps the tangency condition occurs at a specific angle where the distances from the origin match.

Alternatively, maybe
