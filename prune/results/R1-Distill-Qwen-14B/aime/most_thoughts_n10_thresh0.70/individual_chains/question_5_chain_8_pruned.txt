Okay, so I have this geometry problem here, and I need to find the inradius of triangle ABC. Let me try to understand the problem step by step.

The problem says that eight circles of radius 34 are sequentially tangent. Hmm, sequentially tangent probably means that each circle is tangent to the next one in a chain. Also, two of these circles are tangent to sides AB and BC of triangle ABC, respectively. So, I imagine two circles sitting near the corners B, each touching one side and the next circle in the sequence.

Additionally, it mentions that 2024 circles of radius 1 can be arranged in the same manner. That probably refers to a similar configuration but with 2024 small circles instead of eight large ones. Since both configurations are similar, maybe their inradii relate proportionally.

The goal is to find the inradius of triangle ABC, expressed as a fraction m/n where m and n are coprime, and then find m + n.

Let me think about how to approach this. I know that inradius problems often involve the area and semiperimeter of the triangle. The formula is inradius r = Area / semiperimeter. So I might need to find the area and semiperimeter of triangle ABC.

But first, I need to figure out the relationship between the circles and the triangle. The circles being tangent sequentially probably form a chain along the sides of the triangle. Since two circles are tangent to AB and BC, maybe the rest are arranged along the other sides or inside the triangle.

Wait, maybe it's a case of circles packed in the corners and along the sides? Alternatively, perhaps it's similar to a Steiner chain or something related to circle packing in a triangle.

In the case of the eight circles of radius 34, if they are sequentially tangent, the distance between their centers would be twice the radius, so 68 units apart. If they're arranged along a side or a part of the triangle, that might help determine the length of the side.

But wait, two of the circles are tangent to AB and BC. So, perhaps the chain of eight circles starts at AB, goes along AB, then turns the corner at B, goes along BC, and ends there? Or maybe it's a different arrangement.

Alternatively, maybe each pair of circles is tangent, and they form a path from AB to BC, passing through some other sides? Hmm, not sure yet.

But then it says 2024 circles of radius 1 can be arranged in the same manner. So, probably, the same configuration but scaled down. So, maybe the triangle ABC can be thought of as a scaled-up version of a configuration that can fit 2024 circles.

Wait, perhaps the number of circles and their radii relate inversely to the inradius. Maybe the inradius is proportional to the number of circles or their radii?

Alternatively, maybe the chain of circles forms a part of the incircle or something related. Let me think.

If the circles are placed tangent to each other and to the sides, perhaps the entire arrangement is similar to a Pappus chain or something in a circle. But I'm not sure.

Wait, maybe I can model this as a curvilinear polygon inside the triangle, where each circle is placed consecutively. Since the circles are tangent, the distance between their centers is 2r, so for the large circles, it's 68, and for the small ones, it's 2.

But if two of the large circles are tangent to AB and BC, maybe those circles are each tangent to two sides of the triangle. So, perhaps they are similar to the incircle, but with radius 34 instead of the inradius.

Wait, but the inradius is a single circle tangent to all three sides, so if these circles are tangent only to two sides, perhaps they are similar to the ex-circles or something else.

Alternatively, maybe the two circles are each tangent to two sides meeting at a vertex. For example, one circle is tangent to AB and BC, another is tangent to BC and AC, etc.

Wait, but the problem says two of the circles are tangent to AB and BC. So, one circle is tangent to AB, and another is tangent to BC. The rest are sequentially
