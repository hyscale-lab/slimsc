Okay, so I have this problem here: I need to find the largest possible real part of the expression (75 + 117i)z + (96 + 144i)/z, where z is a complex number with |z| = 4. Hmm, that seems a bit involved, but I'll try to break it down.

First, I remember that for any complex number z, if |z| = r, then z can be written as r * e^{iθ}, where θ is the argument of z. Since |z| is 4, z = 4 e^{iθ}. That might simplify things because I can express everything in terms of θ.

Wait, but maybe I can also note that since |z| = 4, then 1/z is equal to the conjugate of z divided by |z| squared. Because for any complex number z, 1/z = \overline{z}/|z|^2. So since |z|^2 is 16 here, 1/z = \overline{z}/16.

Let me write that down:

Let z = a + bi, where a and b are real numbers, and |z| = sqrt(a² + b²) = 4.

Then, 1/z = (a - bi)/16.

But maybe it's better to represent z in polar form because it might make the multiplication and division easier. So let's set z = 4 e^{iθ}. Then, 1/z = (1/4) e^{-iθ}.

So substituting into the expression:

(75 + 117i) z + (96 + 144i)/z
= (75 + 117i)(4 e^{iθ}) + (96 + 144i)(1/(4 e^{iθ}))
= 4(75 + 117i) e^{iθ} + (96 + 144i)/4 e^{-iθ}
= [4*(75 + 117i)] e^{iθ} + [24 + 36i] e^{-iθ}

Wait, 96/4 is 24 and 144/4 is 36, right. So the expression becomes:

[4*(75 + 117i)] e^{iθ} + [24 + 36i] e^{-iθ}

Hmm, perhaps I should compute these coefficients first.

4*(75 + 117i) = 300 + 468i.

So, the expression is (300 + 468i) e^{iθ} + (24 + 36i) e^{-iθ}.

Now, let's write each term in terms of sine and cosine. Because e^{iθ} = cosθ + i sinθ, and e^{-iθ} = cosθ - i sinθ.

So, let's expand both terms:

First term: (300 + 468i)(cosθ + i sinθ)
= 300 cosθ + 300 i sinθ + 468i cosθ + 468 i^2 sinθ
= 300 cosθ + 300 i sinθ + 468i cosθ - 468 sinθ
Because i^2 is -1.

Grouping real and imaginary parts:

Real: 300 cosθ - 468 sinθ
Imaginary: (300 sinθ + 468 cosθ) i

Second term: (24 + 36i)(cosθ - i sinθ)
= 24 cosθ - 24 i sinθ + 36i cosθ - 36i^2 sinθ
= 24 cosθ - 24 i sinθ + 36i cosθ + 36 sinθ
Again, i^2 is -1.

Grouping real and imaginary parts:

Real: 24 cosθ + 36 sinθ
Imaginary: (-24 sinθ + 36 cosθ) i

Now, adding both terms together:

Total real part: (300 cosθ - 468 sinθ) + (24 cosθ + 36 sinθ)
= (300 + 24) cosθ + (-468 + 36) sinθ
= 324 cosθ - 432 sinθ

Total imaginary part: (300 sinθ + 468 cosθ) + (-24 sinθ + 36 cosθ)
= (300 - 24) sinθ + (468 + 36) cosθ
= 276 sinθ + 504 cosθ

But the problem asks for the real part of the entire expression, so I can ignore the imaginary part. So, the real part is 324 cosθ - 432 sinθ.

So now, I have to find the maximum value of 324 cosθ - 432 sinθ.

Hmm, I remember that expressions of the form a cosθ + b sinθ can be rewritten as R cos(θ + φ), where R = sqrt(a² + b²) and φ is some angle. Alternatively, sometimes
