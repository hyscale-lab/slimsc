Okay, so I've got this math problem to solve. Let me read it again and make sure I understand what's being asked.

The problem says: There's a list of positive integers with three properties.

1. The sum of all the items is 30.
2. The unique mode of the list is 9.
3. The median of the list is a positive integer that doesn't appear in the list itself.

I need to find the sum of the squares of all the items in the list.

Hmm, okay. Let me break this down.

First, the list is composed of positive integers. So all numbers are 1 or higher. The sum is 30, so the total when I add all the numbers together is 30.

Next, the unique mode is 9. That means 9 appears more frequently in the list than any other number, and no other number has the same frequency as 9. So 9 must occur at least twice, and more than any other number.

Then, the median is a positive integer that doesn't appear in the list. The median is the middle number when the list is ordered from smallest to largest. If the list has an odd number of elements, the median is the middle one. If it's even, the median is the average of the two middle numbers. But in this problem, the median is an integer and it's not in the list. Hmm, that's interesting because if I have an even number of elements, the median would be the average of two middle numbers. So if the median is an integer, the two middle numbers must add up to an even number, making their average an integer. However, since the median isn't present in the list, that means the two middle numbers can't be the same as the median. So maybe the two middle numbers add up to twice the median, but neither is equal to the median. That would require the two middle numbers to be on either side of the median. But wait, if the list is ordered, the two middle numbers are in positions n/2 and n/2 +1 if the length is even. For example, if the list has 6 elements, the median is the average of the 3rd and 4th elements. So if the median is an integer not in the list, the 3rd and 4th elements must average to that integer but neither is equal to it. Therefore, the 3rd element must be one less than the median, and the 4th element must be one more, or vice versa, but since the list is ordered, they must be in ascending order. Wait, but if the two middle numbers are such that their average is the median, then if the median isn't present, those two numbers must not be equal to the median. Let me think with an example. Suppose the median is 5, and it's not in the list. Then the two middle numbers must average to 5 but neither is 5. So they could be 4 and 6, because (4+6)/2=5. Or maybe 3 and 7, but then the average is 5. So in that case, the two middle numbers would be 4 and 6. So they are symmetric around the median. So in general, for an even number of elements, the two middle numbers are equidistant from the median but not equal to it. 

Alternatively, if the list has an odd number of elements, the median is the middle number, which is in the list. But the problem says the median isn't in the list, so that can't be the case. Therefore, the list must have an even number of elements because if it had an odd number, the median would be an element of the list, which contradicts the third condition. So the length of the list is even. Let's note that down.

So, to recap:

- The list has an even number of elements, let's say 2k elements. So the median is the average of the k-th and (k+1)-th elements.

- The median is a positive integer not present in the list. So,
