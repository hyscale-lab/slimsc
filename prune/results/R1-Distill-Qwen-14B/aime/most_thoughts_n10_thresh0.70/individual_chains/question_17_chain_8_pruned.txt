Alright, so I have this problem about rectangular boxes with a given surface area and volume, and I need to find the radius of the smallest sphere that can contain any of these boxes. Then, compute r squared, express it as a fraction, and find the sum of the numerator and denominator. Hmm, okay, let me break this down.

First, let's parse the problem. We have a set B of rectangular boxes. Each box has a surface area of 54 and a volume of 23. So, all these boxes satisfy these two conditions. I need to find the smallest sphere that can contain each of these boxes, meaning the sphere must be big enough to encompass any such box. The radius of this sphere is r, and I need to find r squared, which will be a fraction p/q where p and q are coprime. Then, I have to find p + q.

Alright, so the key here is to find the maximum possible space diagonal of the boxes in set B because the sphere's diameter has to be at least as long as the space diagonal of the box. So, the sphere's radius will be half of that maximum space diagonal. Therefore, to find r^2, I need to find the square of half the space diagonal. But to get the maximum space diagonal, I need to consider the maximum possible space diagonal among all boxes in set B.

So, the space diagonal d of a rectangular box with side lengths x, y, z is given by d = sqrt(x² + y² + z²). Therefore, r, the radius of the sphere, would be d/2, so r² would be (x² + y² + z²)/4. So, our goal is to maximize (x² + y² + z²), given the constraints on surface area and volume.

The problem now becomes an optimization problem: maximize x² + y² + z² subject to the constraints that the surface area is 54 and the volume is 23.

The surface area S of a rectangular box is given by S = 2(xy + yz + xz) = 54. The volume V is given by V = xyz = 23.

So, we have two equations:

1. 2(xy + yz + xz) = 54 → xy + yz + xz = 27
2. xyz = 23

We need to maximize x² + y² + z².

Hmm, okay, so we have three variables with two equations. To find the maximum of x² + y² + z², perhaps we can use some inequality or optimization techniques.

I remember that for positive real numbers, we can use the method of Lagrange multipliers to find maxima and minima with constraints. Alternatively, maybe we can express x² + y² + z² in terms of the given constraints.

Wait, let's recall that (x + y + z)^2 = x² + y² + z² + 2(xy + yz + xz). Since we know that xy + yz + xz is 27, then (x + y + z)^2 = x² + y² + z² + 54. So, if we can find x + y + z, then we can find x² + y² + z².

But do we know x + y + z? Hmm, not directly. Alternatively, we might need another approach.

Another thought: maybe express x² + y² + z² in terms of the surface area and volume. Let me think.

Alternatively, perhaps using the AM ≥ GM inequality. Wait, but I'm not sure if that directly helps here.

Wait, perhaps it's better to use Lagrange multipliers here.

Let me set up the function to maximize: f(x, y, z) = x² + y² + z².

Subject to the constraints:

g(x, y, z) = xy + yz + xz - 27 = 0

h(x, y, z) = xyz - 23 = 0

So, we can use the method of Lagrange multipliers with two constraints.

The method says that at the extremum, the gradient of f is equal to a linear combination of the gradients of g and h.

So, ∇f = λ ∇g + μ ∇h

Calculating the gradients:

∇f = (2x, 2y, 2z)

∇g = (y + z, x + z, x + y)

∇h = (yz, xz, xy)

So, setting up the equations:

2x = λ(y + z) + μ(yz)  ...(1)

2y = λ(x + z) + μ(xz)  ...(2)

2z = λ(x + y) + μ(xy)  ...(3)

We also have the constraints:

xy + yz + xz = 27 ...(4)

xyz = 23 ...(5)

Now, this is a system of five equations with five variables: x, y, z, λ, μ.

Hmm, this seems a bit involved, but maybe we can find symmetry or assume some variables are equal.

Suppose that x = y = z. Then, we'd have a cube, but let's check if that's possible.

If x = y = z, then surface area 2(3x²) = 6x² = 54 → x² = 9 → x = 3. Then volume would be 27, but the volume is given as 23. So, that's not possible. So, the box isn't a cube, but maybe it's a rectangular box with two sides equal? Let's assume x = y ≠ z.

Let me suppose x = y. Then, let's see.

If x = y, then the constraints become:

Surface area: 2(x² + 2xz) = 54 → x² + 2xz = 27.

Volume: x² z = 23.

We can solve for z from the volume equation: z = 23 / x².

Substituting into surface area:

x² + 2x*(23/x²) = 27 → x² + (46)/x = 27

Multiply both sides by x: x³ + 46 = 27x → x³ -27x +46=0

Hmm, let's try to find a real root for this cubic equation.

Wait, maybe we can factor it.

Let me try x=2: 8 -54 +46= (8+46) -54=54-54=0. So, x=2 is a root.

So, we can factor (x -2)(x² + 2x -23)=0.

So, x=2, or x = [-2 ± sqrt(4 + 92)] / 2 = [-2 ± sqrt(96)] / 2 = [-2 ± 4*sqrt(6)] / 2 = -1 ± 2*sqrt(6). Since x is positive, we take x= -1 + 2*sqrt(6). Let me compute that: sqrt(6) is about 2.449, so 2*
