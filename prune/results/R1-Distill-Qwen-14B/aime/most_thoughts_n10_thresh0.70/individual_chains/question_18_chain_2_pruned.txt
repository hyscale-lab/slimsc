Okay, so I've got this problem where I need to find the number of rectangles that can be formed inside a regular dodecagon, which is a 12-sided polygon. Each side of the rectangle has to lie on either a side or a diagonal of the dodecagon. Hmm, that sounds a bit tricky, but I'll try to break it down step by step.

First, I remember that a regular dodecagon has all sides equal and all internal angles equal. Each internal angle in a regular dodecagon is 150 degrees because the formula for internal angles is ((n-2)*180)/n, which for n=12 gives 150 degrees. But I'm not sure how that helps yet.

The problem is about finding rectangles. Rectangles have opposite sides equal and all angles 90 degrees. So, in the context of the dodecagon, I need to find four points that form such a shape, with their sides aligned either along the sides or diagonals of the dodecagon.

I think the key here is to figure out how to select four points (vertices) of the dodecagon such that they form a rectangle. Since the dodecagon is regular, it's symmetric, which might help in counting.

Let me visualize a regular dodecagon. It has 12 vertices, each separated by 30 degrees (since 360/12=30). If I label the vertices from 0 to 11 in a clockwise manner, then each vertex can be connected to others with sides or diagonals of different lengths.

I remember that in regular polygons, diagonals can be categorized by how many vertices they skip. For example, in a dodecagon, a diagonal can connect a vertex to one that's two steps away, three steps away, etc. Each such diagonal corresponds to a certain number of sides skipped.

But how does this relate to rectangles? Well, a rectangle requires two pairs of parallel sides. In the dodecagon, parallel sides would correspond to sides or diagonals that are equally spaced apart.

Wait, another approach: In a regular polygon, rectangles can be formed by selecting two pairs of diametrically opposite points. But wait, a dodecagon has an even number of sides, so diametrically opposite points exist. Each vertex has a unique opposite vertex 6 steps away.

But wait, a rectangle is defined by having four right angles, so the sides must meet at 90 degrees. In a regular dodecagon, the sides and diagonals can form various angles, and some of them will be 90 degrees.

Alternatively, perhaps rectangles can be formed by selecting four points such that the lines connecting them are both sides and diagonals, forming right angles.

Let me think about the properties of the regular dodecagon. The central angles between consecutive vertices are 30 degrees. So, the angle between two radii from the center to two adjacent vertices is 30 degrees.

If I can find four points where the lines between them form right angles, that would give me a rectangle. So, for a rectangle, the sides must meet at 90 degrees, which in terms of the dodecagon would correspond to a certain number of steps between vertices.

Wait
