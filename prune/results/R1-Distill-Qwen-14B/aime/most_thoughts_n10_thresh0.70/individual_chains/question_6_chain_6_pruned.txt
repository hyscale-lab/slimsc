Alright, so I have this math problem here, and I need to find the number of intersections between two graphs. The functions involved are a bit complicated, so I need to take it step by step.

First, let me make sure I understand the problem correctly. The functions are defined as f(x) = ||x| - 1/2| and g(x) = ||x| - 1/4|. Then, we have two equations:

1. y = 4 * g(f(sin(2πx)))
2. x = 4 * g(f(cos(3πy)))

I need to find how many points (x, y) satisfy both equations simultaneously. So, these are the intersection points of the two graphs.

Hmm, okay. Let me break this down. Both equations involve compositions of f and g with trigonometric functions. So, maybe I should first understand what f and g look like.

Let me start by analyzing f(x) and g(x).

**Understanding f(x) and g(x):**

f(x) = ||x| - 1/2|. Let's think about the graph of this function.

- The inner function is |x|, which is a V-shape with the vertex at (0,0).
- Subtracting 1/2 gives |x| - 1/2, which shifts the graph down by 1/2. So, the vertex is now at (0, -1/2). But since we take the absolute value again, any negative part will flip up.
- So, f(x) is the absolute value of |x| - 1/2. That means the graph will have a V-shape with vertices where |x| - 1/2 = 0, which is at x = ±1/2. At x = 1/2, f(x) = 0. Then, for x beyond ±1/2, f(x) increases linearly. Between -1/2 and 1/2, since |x| - 1/2 is negative, the absolute value makes it positive. So, in that interval, f(x) = 1/2 - |x|. So, the graph is a diamond shape, with vertices at (1/2, 0), (-1/2, 0), and the top at (0, 1/2).

Similarly, g(x) = ||x| - 1/4|. Let's analyze this too.

- Again, starting with |x|, then subtracting 1/4. So, the vertex shifts down to (0, -1/4).
- Taking the absolute value again, the graph will have vertices where |x| - 1/4 = 0, which occurs at x = ±1/4. So, at x = 1/4 and x = -1/4, g(x) = 0. Between -1/4 and 1/4, g(x) = 1/4 - |x|. Beyond that, it's |x| - 1/4.

So, f(x) is a V-shaped graph with vertices at ±1/2 and a peak at 0, and g(x) is similar but with vertices at ±1/4 and a peak at 0.

**Understanding the compositions:**

Now, the functions in the equations involve compositions of these, specifically:

For the first equation: y = 4 * g(f(sin(2πx)))

Let me write that as y = 4 * g(f(s(2πx))), where s is the sine function.

Similarly, the second equation: x = 4 * g(f(c(3πy))), where c is the cosine function.

So, the process is: take the sine (or cosine), apply f to it, then apply g to that result, and scale by 4.

Let me try to figure out the range and possible values these functions can take.

**Range of f(sin(2πx)) and f(cos(3πy)):**

First, let's find the range of sin(2πx) and cos(3πy). Both sin and cos functions have outputs between -1 and 1.

So, sin(2πx) ∈ [-1, 1], similarly for cos(3πy) ∈ [-1, 1].

When we apply f to these, let's see:

f(t) = ||t| - 1/2|.

Since t is between -1 and 1, |t| is between 0 and 1.

So, for |t| in [0,1], |t| - 1/2 is between -1/2 and 1/2. Taking the absolute value, f(t) is between 0 and 1/2.

Wait, let's verify:

- When |t| is 0: f(t) = |0 - 1/2| = 1/2.
- When |t| is 1: f(t) = |1 - 1/2| = 1/2.
- At |t| = 1/2: f(t) = 0.

So, f(t) is a V-shaped graph with maximum 1/2 at t=0 and t=±1, and 0 at t=±1/2.

So, f(sin(2πx)) will have a range of [0, 1/2], same with f(cos(3πy)).

Then, we apply g to that result.

g(s) = ||s| - 1/4|, where s ∈ [0, 1/2].

So, s is non-negative, so |s| = s.

Thus, g(s) = |s - 1/4|.

This is a V-shaped graph with vertex at s=1/4.

- For s < 1/4, g(s) = 1/4 - s.
- For s ≥ 1/4, g(s) = s - 1/4.

So, the range of g(s) is from 0 to 1/4. Because:

- At s=0, g(s)=1/4.
- At s=1/4, g(s)=0.
- At s=1/2, g(s)=1/2 -1/4=1/4.

So, the output of g(f(sin(2πx))) will be in [0, 1/4]. Then, we multiply by 4, so 4 * g(f(sin(2πx))) will be in [0,1].

Similarly, 4 * g(f(cos(3πy))) will be in [0,1].

So, both y and x in the two equations are in [0,1].

Wait, let me make sure:

- For y = 4 * g(f(sin(2πx))), since g(f(...)) is in [0,1/4], multiplying by 4 gives [0,1]. So y ∈ [0,1].

Similarly, x = 4 * g(f(cos(3πy))) implies x ∈ [0,1].

So, both x and y are between 0 and 1. So, the domain we're looking at is the unit square [0,1] × [0,1].

Now, I need to find the number of (x,y) pairs in this square that satisfy both equations.

This seems a bit abstract. Maybe I should try to express one variable in terms of the other and find solutions.

Alternatively, perhaps I can analyze the functions y = 4g(f(sin(2πx))) and x = 4g(f(cos(3πy))) and see how they behave.

But since both equations involve trigonometric functions with different frequencies, this might get complicated. Let me think.

Perhaps I can parameterize the problem. Let me consider that for each x, y is determined by the first equation, and then I can check whether that y satisfies the second equation for x.

But that might be tricky because it's a system of equations. Another idea is to plot both functions and see how they intersect, but since I can't plot here, I need to do it algebraically.

Wait, maybe I can consider the functions as mappings and find the number of solutions where y = 4g(f(sin(2πx))) and x = 4g(f(cos(3πy))).

Alternatively, since both x and y are between 0 and 1, perhaps I can consider substituting one equation into the other.

Let me see: From the first equation, y = 4g(f(sin(2πx))). Let me call this Equation (1).

From the second equation, x = 4g(f(cos(3πy))). Let me call this Equation (2).

If I substitute y from Equation (1) into Equation (2), I get:

x = 4g(f(cos(3π * [4g(f(sin(2πx)))])))

Hmm, that looks very complicated. It's a nested function with multiple layers. Maybe that's not the best approach.

Alternatively, perhaps I can consider the problem in terms of periodicity. Let me think about the periods of the sine and cosine functions involved.

In Equation (1), inside sin(2πx), the period is 1 because the argument is 2πx. So, sin(2πx) has a period of 1. Similarly, in Equation (2), cos(3πy) has a period of 2/3 because the argument is 3πy. So, cos(3πy) has a period of 2/3.

Therefore, the functions inside f and g are periodic with periods 1 and 2/3, respectively.

But since both x and y are in [0,1], perhaps I can model the behavior within this interval.

Alternatively, maybe I can consider that over [0,1], sin(2πx) goes through a full period, oscillating between -1 and 1, and similarly for cos(3πy) over [0, 2/3], but since y is in [0,1], it would go through 3/2 periods.

Hmm, this seems a bit messy. Maybe another approach is needed.

Wait, perhaps I can analyze the behavior of the function y = 4g(f(sin(2πx))) and x = 4g(f(cos(3πy))) and see how many times their graphs intersect.

But without plotting, it's hard to see. Maybe I can find how many solutions exist for each equation and then see how they interact.

Alternatively, since both functions map [0,1] to [0,1], maybe I can consider that each equation represents a graph in the unit square, and their intersections are the solutions.

But perhaps another approach: since both functions involve nested absolute values and trigonometric functions, maybe I can find the number of solutions by considering the possible number of times each function can take a certain value.

Let me try to find how many times y = 4g(f(sin(2πx))) can intersect with x = 4g(f(cos(3πy))).

Wait, perhaps I can consider that for each x, y is determined, and for each y, x is determined, so it's a system of equations. Maybe I can write y in terms of x and x in terms of y and find fixed points or something. But that's not straightforward.

Alternatively, perhaps I can consider the functions as transformations and see how many pre-images each
