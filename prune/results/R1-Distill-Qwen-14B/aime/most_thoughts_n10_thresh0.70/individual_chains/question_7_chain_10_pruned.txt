Okay, so I've got this problem about coloring the vertices of a regular octagon either red or blue. Each vertex is colored independently with equal probability, so that's 50-50 for red or blue. The question is about the probability that after coloring, we can rotate the octagon such that all the blue vertices end up where there were originally red vertices. Hmm, that's a bit abstract, but let me try to break it down.

First, I need to understand what exactly is being asked here. So, we have a regular octagon, which means it's an eight-sided polygon with all sides and angles equal. Each vertex is colored either red or blue, each with a 50% chance. So, in total, there are 2^8 = 256 possible colorings since each vertex has two choices.

The problem is asking for the probability that there exists a rotation of the octagon such that every blue vertex moves to a position that was previously red. So, if we think about it, the octagon can be rotated by 0°, 45°, 90°, ..., up to 315°, which are eight possible rotations in total (including the 0° rotation, which is just the identity rotation, leaving everything as it is).

Wait, but in group theory terms, the rotation group of the octagon is cyclic of order 8, right? So, the group has eight elements corresponding to rotations by multiples of 45 degrees. So, for each coloring, we can apply one of these rotations, and we want to know if there exists a rotation (including the identity) such that when we apply it, every blue vertex is mapped to a red vertex.

But how do we translate this condition into something more workable? Maybe we can think in terms of permutations. Each rotation is a permutation of the vertices. The condition is that for some permutation σ (which is a rotation), the image of each blue vertex under σ is a red vertex.

Wait, another way to look at it: suppose we have a coloring C where each vertex is either red or blue. We need that there exists a rotation σ such that for every vertex v, if C(v) is blue, then C(σ(v)) is red. Hmm, that seems a bit tricky.

Alternatively, maybe we can model this as a function. Let me think: the set of colorings is all possible functions from the set of vertices to {red, blue}. We want the number of colorings C such that there exists a rotation σ where C composed with σ is a coloring where all the blue vertices are mapped to red. Hmm, that might not be the right way around.

Wait, maybe it's better to think of it as a system of equations. So, for each vertex, after applying rotation σ, the color of that vertex must satisfy that if it was blue, the vertex it was rotated from was red. Hmm, that's a bit vague. Let me try to rephrase.

Alternatively, perhaps considering that after rotation, the set of blue vertices must be a subset of the set of red vertices. Wait, because each blue vertex moves to a red position. So, the image of the blue set under the rotation must be a subset of the red set. So, if B is the set of blue vertices, then σ(B) ⊆ R
