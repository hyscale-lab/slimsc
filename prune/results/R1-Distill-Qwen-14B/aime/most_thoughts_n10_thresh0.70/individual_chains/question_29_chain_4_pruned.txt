Alright, so I came across this geometry problem, and I want to figure it out step by step. Let me start by understanding what's given.

We have two rectangles, ABCD and EFGH. The points D, E, C, F are collinear, which means they all lie on a straight line. Also, the points A, D, H, G all lie on a circle. Interesting. So, there's a cyclic quadrilateral here.

Given lengths:
- BC = 16
- AB = 107
- FG = 17
- EF = 184

We need to find the length of CE.

First, I should probably sketch a diagram to visualize the problem. Let me describe it in my mind. Rectangle ABCD: AB is one side, BC is another. So, AB is 107 units, and BC is 16 units. That makes ABCD a rectangle with length 107 and width 16.

Similarly, rectangle EFGH has sides EF = 184 and FG = 17. So, EF is the length, and FG is the width.

Now, the points D, E, C, F are collinear. So, if I imagine rectangle ABCD, point D is one corner, and point C is the adjacent corner. Then, points E and F are on the same line extending from D and C respectively.

Wait, actually, since D, E, C, F are collinear, they must lie on a straight line in that specific order? Or could they be in a different order?

Hmm, not necessarily. Let's consider that the order is D, E, C, F. Or maybe E, D, C, F? Or some other order? Hmm, it's unclear. But since D and C are adjacent corners of rectangle ABCD, their positions are fixed relative to each other.

Wait, in rectangle ABCD, the order of vertices is important. Let me clarify the structure.

Assuming ABCD is a rectangle, the points are arranged in order such that AB is adjacent to BC, which is adjacent to CD, then DA. So, the order is A, B, C, D, connected in a cycle.

Similarly, EFGH is a rectangle with points E, F, G, H.

Given that D, E, C, F are collinear, so points D and C are on a line with E and F. So, perhaps the line passes through D, E, C, F? Or maybe E, D, C, F? Not sure yet.

Also, points A, D, H, G lie on a circle. So, quadrilateral ADHG is cyclic.

So, let me try to imagine the setup. Maybe rectangles ABCD and EFGH are placed such that their sides are along a common line, with D and C lying on this line, along with E and F.

Wait, perhaps the line DC is part of both rectangles? Or maybe not. Let me think.

Alternatively, maybe the sides DC and EF are along the same straight line, with E and F extending beyond D and C.

But since D, E, C, F are collinear, I can think that E is on one side of D, and F is on the other side beyond C. Or maybe E is between D and C, and F is beyond C.

Hmm, this is a bit confusing. Maybe I should assign coordinates to the points to make things clearer.

Let me place point D at the origin (0, 0). Since ABCD is a rectangle, and BC is 16, AB is 107.

Wait, let's define the coordinates:

Let me assume that rectangle ABCD is placed such that:

- Point D is at (0, 0).
- Since ABCD is a rectangle, and BC is 16, which is the height, and AB is the base, length 107.

Wait, but in a rectangle, adjacent sides are of different lengths. So, if AB is 107, then DC is also 107. And BC is 16, so AD is also
