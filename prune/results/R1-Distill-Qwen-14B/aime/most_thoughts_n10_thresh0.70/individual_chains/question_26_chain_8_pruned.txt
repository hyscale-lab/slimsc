Okay, so I have this geometry problem here, and I need to figure out the length of AP in triangle ABC inscribed in a circle ω. The tangents at B and C meet at D, and AD intersects ω again at P. The sides are AB=5, BC=9, AC=10. I need to find AP as a fraction m/n where m and n are coprime, then find m + n. Hmmm.

Let me try to visualize the problem. Triangle ABC with sides AB=5, BC=9, AC=10. So, it's a scalene triangle. The circle ω is the circumcircle of ABC. The tangents at B and C meet at D. Then, AD intersects ω again at P. So, point D is the exsimilicenter or the external homothety center of the circle ω with respect to the tangents at B and C.

I remember that the point where two tangents meet is called the ex-pole or something like that. Also, since D is the intersection of two tangents, DB and DC are equal because they are both tangents from D to ω. So, triangle DBC is isosceles with DB = DC.

Now, I need to find AP. Since P is the second intersection point of AD with ω, perhaps I can use power of a point, or some properties related to cyclic quadrilaterals, or maybe harmonic division. Alternatively, using Ceva's theorem or Menelaus's theorem might come into play here.

Let me recall that the power of point D with respect to ω is equal to DB^2 = DC^2. Also, since AD intersects ω at A and P, the power of D with respect to ω is also equal to DA * DP. So, DA * DP = DB^2.

So, if I can find DA and DB, then I can find DP, and since AP = DP - AD (depending on the direction), but wait, actually AP is from A to P, so maybe it's more about the ratio.

Wait, maybe it's better to think in terms of similar triangles or harmonic division. Alternatively, using inversion might help, but that might be too complicated for this problem.

Alternatively, maybe using coordinates. Let me consider coordinate geometry. Let me place point C at the origin, point A somewhere on the x-axis, and point B somewhere in the plane. Then, I can find coordinates for D by finding the intersection of the two tangents at B and C.

Wait, that might be a bit involved, but let me try.

First, let's assign coordinates. Let me place point C at (0,0). Then, since AC is 10, let me place point A at (10, 0). Then, point B is somewhere in the plane. I need to find its coordinates. Given that AB=5 and BC=9.

So, coordinates: A(10,0), C(0,0). Let B be at (x,y). Then, distance from B to C is sqrt(x^2 + y^2) = 9, so x² + y² = 81.

Distance from B to A is sqrt( (x-10)^2 + y^2 ) = 5, so (x-10)^2 + y^2 = 25.

Subtracting the first equation from the second: (x-10)^2 + y^2 - (x² + y²) = 25 - 81 => (x² -20x +100) - x² = -56 => -20x +100 = -56 => -20x = -156 => x = 156/20 = 39/5 = 7.8.

So, x = 7.8, which is 39/5. Then, from x² + y² = 81: (39/5)^2 + y² = 81.

Calculate (39/5)^2: 39^2 = 1521, so 1521/25. Then, y² = 81 - 1521/25. Convert 81 to 2025/25, so 2025/25 - 1521/25 = 504/25. So, y = sqrt(504/25) = sqrt(504)/5.

Simplify sqrt(504): 504 = 16*31.5, wait, 504 divided by 16 is 31.5, which is not an integer. Wait, 504 = 16*31.5? Hmm, maybe another factorization: 504 = 16*31.5, no, that's not helpful. Wait, 504 = 16 * 31.5? Maybe I made a mistake.

Wait, 504 divided by 16 is 31.5, but that's not an integer. Maybe I should factor 504 as 16 * 31.5 isn't helpful. Alternatively, 504 = 9 * 56 = 9 * 7 * 8. So, sqrt(504) = sqrt(9*56) = 3*sqrt(56) = 3*sqrt(4*14) = 3*2*sqrt(14) = 6*sqrt(14). So, sqrt(504) = 6√14. So, y = 6√14 / 5.

So, point B is at (39/5, 6√14/5).

Now, I need to find the equation of the tangent at B and at C. The tangent at C is easy since C is at (0,0). The tangent at a point on a circle is perpendicular to the radius at that point. So, the radius at C is from the center of the circle to C. But wait, I need to find the center of the circle ω.

Wait, since ABC is inscribed in ω, the circumcircle, so I need to find the circumradius and the center.

Alternatively, perhaps I can find the equation of ω. Let me find the circumcircle equation passing through A(10,0), B(39/5, 6√14/5), and C(0,0).

Let the general equation of a circle be x² + y² + Dx + Ey + F = 0. Since it passes through C(0,0), plugging in: 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + F = 0 => F = 0.

So, the equation is x² + y² + Dx + Ey = 0.

Now, plug in A(10,0): 100 + 0 + 10D + 0 = 0 => 10D = -100 => D = -10.

So, equation becomes x² + y² -10x + Ey = 0.

Now, plug in B(39/5, 6√14/5): (39/5)^2 + (6√14/5)^2 -10*(39/5) + E*(6√14/5) = 0.

Compute each term:

(39/5)^2 = (1521)/25

(6√14/5)^2 = (36*14)/25 = 504/25

-10*(39/5) = -(390/5) = -78

So, equation:

1521/25 + 504/25 -78 + (6√14 E)/5 = 0

Adding the first two terms: (1521 + 504)/25 = 2025/25 = 81.

So, 81 -78 + (6√14 E)/5 = 0.

81 -78 = 3, so 3 + (6√14 E)/5 = 0 => (6√14 E)/5 = -3 => E = (-3 *5)/(6√14) = (-15)/(6√14) = (-5)/(2√14) = rationalized as (-5√14)/(2*14) = (-5√14)/28.

So, E = -5√14 /28.

Thus, the equation of ω is x² + y² -10x - (5√14 /28)y = 0.

Now, find the tangent at B and the tangent at C.

First, the tangent at C(0,0). The tangent at a point on the circle is given by T = 0, where T is the equation obtained by replacing x² with x*x0, y² with y*y0, etc. So, the tangent at C is: x*0 + y*0 + D*(x + 0)/2 + E*(y + 0)/2 + F = 0. Wait, no, the standard tangent equation at (x0, y0) is xx0 + yy0 + D*(x + x0)/2 + E*(y + y0)/2 + F = 0.

But since F=0, and C is (0,0), the tangent at C is x*0 + y*0 + D*(x + 0)/2 + E*(y + 0)/2 = 0 => D x /2 + E y /2 = 0.

Multiply both sides by 2: D x + E y = 0. Since D = -10, E = -5√14 /28, so:

-10 x - (5√14 /28) y = 0 => 10x + (5√14 /28) y = 0.

Wait, that seems like the equation of the tangent at C. But since C is at (0,0), and the tangent at C is actually the line that touches ω only at C. But wait, the tangent at C should not pass through C only, but in this case, the equation we've derived is the tangent line. Wait, but the tangent at C is the line perpendicular to the radius OC, where O is the center of ω.

Wait, the center O of ω can be found from the equation. The general form is x² + y² + Dx + Ey + F =0, so center is (-D/2, -E/2). Here, D=-10, E=-5√14/28.

So, center O is at (5, (5√14)/56). Wait, O_x = -D/2 = 10/2=5. O_y = -E/2 = (5√14/28)/2 = 5√14/(56).

So, center O is at (5, 5√14/56).

So, the radius at point C is the line from O(5,5√14/56) to C(0,0). The tangent at C is perpendicular to this radius.

So, the slope of OC is (5√14/56 - 0)/(5 - 0) = (√14/56)/1 = √14/56. Wait, 5√14/56 divided by 5 is √14/56. Hmm, that's a very small slope.

The tangent at C is perpendicular to OC, so its slope is the negative reciprocal. So, slope is -56/√14. Simplify 56/√14: 56 divided by √14 is (56√14)/14 = 4√14. So, the slope is -4√14.

Therefore, the tangent at C is a line through (0,0) with slope -4√14. So, equation is y = -4√14 x.

Wait, let me verify this because earlier when I used the tangent formula, I got 10x + (5√14 /28)y =0, which simplifies to y = (-10 / (5√14 /28)) x = (-10 *28 /5√14) x = (-56 /√14) x = which is same as -4√14 x. So, yes, that's correct.

So, the tangent at C is y = -4√14 x.

Similarly, find the tangent at B. Let's compute it.

The tangent at B(39/5, 6√14/5) can be found similarly. The slope of OB is
