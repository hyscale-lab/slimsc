Okay, so I have this math problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again carefully.

We have points O at (0,0), A at (1/2, 0), and B at (0, sqrt(3)/2). Then there's a family F of segments PQ of unit length lying in the first quadrant, with P on the x-axis and Q on the y-axis. So each PQ is a line segment from the x-axis to the y-axis, length 1, in the first quadrant.

The problem says there's a unique point C on AB, other than A and B, that doesn't belong to any segment from F except AB itself. We need to find OC², express it as p/q where p and q are coprime, then find p+q.

Hmm. So, first, let me visualize this. O is the origin, A is on the x-axis at (1/2, 0), and B is on the y-axis at (0, sqrt(3)/2). So AB is a line segment connecting these two points. Let me write the equation for AB.

The coordinates of A are (1/2, 0) and B are (0, sqrt(3)/2). The slope of AB is (sqrt(3)/2 - 0)/(0 - 1/2) = (sqrt(3)/2)/(-1/2) = -sqrt(3). So the equation of line AB is y - 0 = -sqrt(3)(x - 1/2). Simplifying, y = -sqrt(3)x + sqrt(3)/2.

Now, the family F consists of segments PQ, each of unit length, with P on the x-axis and Q on the y-axis in the first quadrant. So each such PQ is a segment from (p,0) to (0,q) where p and q are positive real numbers, and the distance between (p,0) and (0,q) is 1. That is, sqrt(p² + q²) = 1. So p² + q² = 1. Therefore, each PQ is a segment from (p, 0) to (0, q), where p and q satisfy p² + q² = 1, and p, q > 0.

The problem states that there is a unique point C on AB (other than A and B) that does not lie on any segment PQ from F except AB. So, for point C, it lies on AB, and if you look at all the segments PQ in F, only AB passes through C. All other PQs from F do not contain C.

Our goal is to find OC², which is the square of the distance from the origin to C.

So, how do I approach this? Let me think.

First, perhaps I can parametrize the line AB and find point C such that it's not on any other PQ except AB. Alternatively, maybe there's a way to find the envelope of all these PQ segments and see where AB intersects this envelope, but that might be more complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps I can think in terms of parametric equations. Let's parameterize point C on AB. Since AB goes from A(1/2, 0) to B(0, sqrt(3)/2), we can write C as a linear combination of A and B. Let me let t be a parameter between 0 and 1, so C = (1 - t)*A + t*B. That is, C = ((1 - t)*(1/2) + t*0, (1 - t)*0 + t*(sqrt(3)/2)) = ( (1 - t)/2, t*sqrt(3)/2 ). So C has coordinates ( (1 - t)/2, (t * sqrt(3))/2 ).

We can also express AB as y = -sqrt(3)x + sqrt(3)/2, so any point on AB can be written as (x, -sqrt(3)x + sqrt(3)/2).

Now, the problem is that C is on AB, and it's not on any other PQ in F except AB itself. So, for any other PQ in F, C is not on PQ. So, for any PQ, which connects (p,0) to (0, q) with p² + q² = 1, the point C is not on PQ unless PQ is AB.

So, how can I find such a point C? Maybe I need to find the point where all the possible PQs from F are tangent to the curve that is the envelope of F. Alternatively, perhaps point C is where AB
