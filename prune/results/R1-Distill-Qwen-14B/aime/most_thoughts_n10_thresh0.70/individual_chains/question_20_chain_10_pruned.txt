Okay, so I need to solve this problem about placing chips on a 5x5 grid. Let me read the problem again and make sure I understand all the conditions.

We have 25 white chips and 25 black chips. They're indistinguishable, meaning I can't tell one white chip from another, same with black. The grid is 5x5, so 25 cells. Each cell can hold at most one chip. So, in the end, some number of chips (from 0 to 25) will be placed on the grid, but no more than one per cell.

Now, the key conditions are:

1. All chips in the same row must be the same color.
2. All chips in the same column must be the same color.
3. Any additional chip placed would violate one or more of the previous two conditions.

So, the third condition is a bit tricky. It means that after placing the chips, the grid is as full as possible without violating the first two conditions. Adding another chip anywhere would force either a row or a column to have mixed colors, which isn't allowed.

Let me think about what this implies. Each row can either be all white, all black, or have no chips. Similarly, each column can be all white, all black, or have no chips. But because of the third condition, for any cell that's empty, adding a chip would require that entire row and column to be that color, which would conflict with existing chips in that row or column.

Wait, maybe another way to look at it: Since each row must be a single color if any chips are placed, and same with each column, the grid can't have a mix of colors in a single row or column. So, in other words, each row and each column is either entirely white, entirely black, or entirely empty.

But the third condition ensures that the placement is maximal, meaning you can't add any more chips without violating the color uniformity in their row or column.

So another way to think is that each row is either all white, all black, or empty. Similarly for each column. But these choices can't conflict in a way that would allow adding another chip.

Wait, but if a row is all white, then every column that intersects with it must also be all white or all black. Hmm, maybe not, because the columns could have their own color assignments. But if, say, a row is all white, then any column that has a white chip in that row must also be all white, because if a column has a white chip, all chips in that column must be white. So, if a row is all white, then any column that intersects with that row must be all white or all black, but if a column is all black, then the intersection of that column and row would have a black chip, but the row is all white, which is a conflict.

Wait, that seems contradictory. Let's think more carefully. Suppose a row is all white. Then, every column that has a chip in that row must be all white. Because the column's chips must all be the same color. So, if any cell in a row is white, then the entire column of that cell must also be white. Because that column can't have any other color. Similarly, if a column is all black, then every row that intersects with it must be all black.

Wait, so this is starting to look like a grid divided into blocks where entire rows and columns are assigned colors, and these assignments must not conflict.

Let me formalize this. Let's denote that each row is either white, black, or empty. Similarly, each column is either white, black, or empty. But if a row is colored, say white, then all the columns intersecting with that row must also be white. Similarly, if a column is colored black, then all the rows intersecting that column must be black.

Wait, that seems like either a row or a column can't impose conflicting color constraints. So perhaps the only possibilities are that all the rows are colored, or all the columns are colored? Or perhaps some combination where rows and columns don't conflict.

Wait, maybe the entire grid must be either all white, all black, or have some pattern where all the colored rows and columns don't interfere. But I'm getting a bit confused. Let's try a different approach.

Another way: Since each row must be uniform in color, and each column must be uniform in color, the grid must form a sort of partition where the colored regions are rectangles of a single color, and these rectangles can't overlap in conflicting ways.

Wait, but the third condition says that the grid is maximal, meaning that adding any more chips would violate the row or column constraints. So, for any empty cell, adding a chip there would require that its row and column be entirely that color, but that's impossible because the row or column already has chips of a different color.

Hmm, maybe let's model the grid as a matrix where each cell is either white, black, or empty. But with the constraints that every non-empty row is uniform in color, every non-empty
