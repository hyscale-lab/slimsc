Okay, so I've got this problem here about coloring the vertices of a regular octagon either red or blue, each with equal probability. The question is about finding the probability that after such a coloring, there's a rotation that turns all the blue vertices into positions where there were originally red ones. Hmm, that sounds a bit abstract, but let's try to break it down.

First, let me paraphrase the problem to make sure I get it. We have a regular octagon, which means all sides and angles are equal. Each of its eight vertices is colored either red or blue, and each color is equally likely, so 50% chance for red and 50% for blue. Now, after coloring, we want to find the probability that we can rotate the octagon in such a way that every blue vertex moves to a position that was previously red. 

So, the probability is m/n where m and n are coprime, and we need to find m + n. Got it.

I think the key here is to figure out the conditions under which such a rotation exists. Since it's a regular octagon, it has rotational symmetry. The group of rotations is cyclic of order 8, right? So, the rotations can be by 0°, 45°, 90°, ..., up to 315°, which correspond to rotating by 0, 1, 2, ..., 7 steps of 45° each.

Wait, so each rotation is an element of the cyclic group C8. Each rotation can be thought of as shifting the positions of the vertices. So, if we have a coloring, we can rotate it by some k positions, and see if after rotation, each blue vertex is now where a red one was.

Another way to put it: after rotation, the set of blue vertices must be a subset of the original red vertices. So, the blue vertices must be a translate (under rotation) of the red vertices. Hmm, or maybe the blue set is a shift of the red set.

Alternatively, if we let R be the set of red vertices and B be the set of blue ones, we want that B is equal to R shifted by some rotation. But since R and B are complements (because every vertex is either red or blue), so B is the complement of R. So, for R shifted by some rotation k, we have B = (R + k) mod 8. But since B is also the complement of R, that would mean that (R + k) mod 8 is equal to the complement of R.

Wait, so R shifted by k is equal to the complement of R. That suggests that R is a subset that is invariant under some rotation, but I'm not entirely sure.

Alternatively, perhaps R is a union of cosets of some subgroup of the cyclic group C8. Because if shifting R by k positions results in the complement of R, then R must be a union of cosets, perhaps?

Wait, another approach: For each coloring, we can represent the vertices as elements of the cyclic group Z8, with vertices labeled 0 through 7. Then, each rotation corresponds to adding a constant modulo 8.

So, if we have a set R of red vertices, and a set B of blue vertices, which is the complement of R. We need that there exists some k such that B = R + k mod 8.

But since B is R complement, that would mean that for each r in R, r + k is in B, which is R complement. So, for every r in R, r + k is not in R. Which implies that R is a set such that R + k is contained in R complement.

So, R ∩ (R + k) = empty set. Since R and R + k are disjoint. Also, since R + k is a shifted version of R, maybe R is a union of certain cosets.

Wait, if R is a union of cosets of some subgroup H, then shifting R by k (which is in H) would leave R unchanged. But in our case, shifting R by k would take R to R + k, which is its complement. So, that suggests that R shifted by k is the complement of R.

But if R is a union of cosets, then its complement would also be a union of cosets. Perhaps R is a union of cosets of some subgroup, and then shifting by the generator of that subgroup would take R to its complement.

Wait, let me think about the structure of Z8.

Z8 has subgroups of orders dividing 8: so subgroups of order 1, 2, 4, and 8. The subgroup of order 2 is {0,4}, order 4 is {0,2,4,6}, and so on.

Suppose R is a union of cosets of some subgroup H. If H is a subgroup of Z8, then the cosets are of the form H + k. So, if R is a union of multiple cosets, then R is a subgroup itself or a union of cosets.

Wait, but in Z8, the only subgroups are those I mentioned. So, if R is a union of cosets, say, of H, then the size of R must be a multiple of the index of H.

For example, if H is the subgroup of order 2, then the index is 4, so R could be a union of two cosets, which would make |R| = 4. Similarly, if H is the subgroup of order 4, the index is 2, so R could be a union of one coset (size 4) or two cosets (size 8, but that's the whole group).

Wait, but for R to be a union of cosets, it's necessary that R is itself a subgroup or a union of cosets. Hmm, but in our problem, R is a subset of the vertices, which are elements of Z8, and R can be any subset, but in the cases where R satisfies the condition, it must be a union of cosets.

Wait, perhaps R must be a union of cosets of some cyclic subgroup, so that shifting R by a generator of that subgroup would map R to its complement.

Wait, let's think for a specific example. Let me consider the case when R is a single coset of a subgroup H. If H is of order 2, then each coset has size 2. So, if R is a single coset, size 2, then shifting R by 2 positions (the generator of H) would map R to another coset. But if R is a single coset of H, then R + 2 is another coset. So, unless R + k is the entire complement of R, which in this case would be a union of the other cosets. So, for example, if R is {0,4}, then R + 2 would be {2,6}, which is another coset. The complement of R is {1,2,3,5,6,7}. Hmm, which is not a coset, so that doesn't fit.

Wait, maybe H needs to be such that shifting R by k wraps around and covers the complement.

Alternatively, perhaps if H is a subgroup of order 4, so index 2. Then, R could be a coset of H, which would have size 4. So, for example, H = {0,2,4,6}, and R = H +1 = {1,3,5,7}. Then, if we shift R by 2 (the generator of H), R + 2 = {3,5,7,1}, which is the same as R. So that doesn't help.

Wait, but the complement of R in this case is H itself. So, if R is a coset of H, then its complement is another coset. So, in this case, R + k would be another coset if k is in H. But in this case, the complement is also a coset. So, perhaps if R is a union of cosets, and the complement is another union, such that shifting R by some k would result in the complement.

Wait, for example, if R is a single coset of a subgroup H of order 4, then the complement is another coset. So
