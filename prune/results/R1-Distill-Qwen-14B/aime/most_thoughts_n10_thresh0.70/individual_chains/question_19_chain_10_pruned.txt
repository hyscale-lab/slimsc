Okay, so I've got this geometry problem here about triangle ABC. The problem says that the circumcenter is O and the incenter is I. It also mentions that IA is perpendicular to OI. The circumradius is 13, and the inradius is 6. I need to find the product AB multiplied by AC.

Hmm, let me start by recalling some properties of triangle centers. The circumradius R is given as 13, and the inradius r is 6. The circumradius is the radius of the circumscribed circle, and the inradius is the radius of the inscribed circle.

The problem states that IA is perpendicular to OI. IA is the segment from the incenter I to vertex A, and OI is the segment connecting the circumcenter O to the incenter I. So, these two lines are perpendicular.

I remember that in a triangle, the inradius and the circumradius are related to other elements of the triangle like the sides, area, semiperimeter, etc. Maybe I can find some relations using these.

Let me jot down the key points:

1. Triangle ABC with circumradius R = 13.
2. Inradius r = 6.
3. IA ⊥ OI.
4. Need to find AB * AC.

First, perhaps I can find some relations involving the distances between O and I. There's a formula that relates the distance between the incenter and circumcenter: OI² = R(R - 2r). Wait, is that correct?

Wait, the formula I recall for the distance between the incenter and circumradius is OI² = R² - 2Rr. Let me verify that. I think it's OI² = R² - 2Rr. So, substituting the given values, OI² = 13² - 2*13*6.

Calculating that: 13² is 169, and 2*13*6 is 156. So OI² = 169 - 156 = 13. Therefore, OI is sqrt(13). Hmm, interesting, so OI is sqrt(13).

But the problem says IA is perpendicular to OI. So, in triangle IOA, we have a right angle at I. So, triangle IOA is right-angled at I.

Wait, let me think about this. So, in triangle IOA, angle at I is 90 degrees. So, by Pythagoras theorem, OA² = IO² + IA².

But OA is the circumradius, which is R = 13. So, OA² = 13² = 169.

We know IO² is 13, so 169 = 13 + IA². That implies IA² = 169 -13 = 156. Therefore, IA = sqrt(156). Which simplifies to 2*sqrt(39).

Wait, so IA = sqrt(156) = 2*sqrt(39). Hmm, okay.

So, IA is the length of the inradius segment from I to A. But wait, IA is not the inradius itself. The in
