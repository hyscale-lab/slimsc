Okay, so I have this math problem here. It says: Let p be the least prime number for which there exists a positive integer n such that n⁴ + 1 is divisible by p². Then, I need to find the least positive integer m such that m⁴ +1 is divisible by p². Hmm, interesting.

First, I need to figure out what the smallest prime p is where p² divides n⁴ +1 for some n. Once I find that p, I'll have to find the smallest m for which m⁴ +1 is divisible by p².

Let me start by understanding what it means for p² to divide n⁴ +1. That means that n⁴ ≡ -1 mod p². So, n⁴ ≡ -1 mod p². Which implies that n^8 ≡ 1 mod p² because if I square both sides, (n⁴)² ≡ (-1)² ≡ 1 mod p².

Therefore, the order of n modulo p² must divide 8. But wait, the order is the smallest positive integer k such that n^k ≡ 1 mod p². Since n^8 ≡1, the order divides 8. Also, since n⁴ ≡ -1 mod p², the order can't be less than 8 because if it were, say 4, then n⁴ would be ≡1 mod p², but in reality it's ≡-1. Similarly, if order were 2 or 1, n² or n would be ≡1 which is not the case. So the order must be exactly 8.

So, the multiplicative order of n modulo p² is 8. This suggests that 8 divides p² -1 because the multiplicative group modulo p² is cyclic of order p(p-1). Wait, no. Wait, p is prime, so the multiplicative group mod p² is cyclic of order p(p-1). So, for an element to have order 8, 8 must divide p(p-1). Therefore, p must be such that 8 divides p(p-1). Since p is prime, either 8 divides p-1 or p=2.

But p=2: Let me check if p=2 is possible. So, suppose p=2. Then n⁴ +1 ≡0 mod 4. Let's see, n⁴ mod 4. Let's compute n⁴ for n=1:1, n=2:0, but 2 is even. Wait, n can be 1: 1⁴ +1=2, which is not divisible by 4. n=3: 3⁴=81, 81+1=82, which mod 4 is 82 mod4= 82-80=2, so 2 mod4. So, n⁴ +1 is either 2 mod4 or 1 mod4, which can't be 0 mod4. So p=2 is impossible because there's no n where n⁴ +1 is divisible by 4.

So p cannot be 2
