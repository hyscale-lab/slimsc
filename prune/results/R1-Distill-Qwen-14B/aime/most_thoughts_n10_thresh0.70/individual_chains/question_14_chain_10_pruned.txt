Okay, so I have this math problem here. Let me try to understand it step by step.

The problem says: Let N be the greatest four-digit positive integer with the property that whenever one of its digits is changed to 1, the resulting number is divisible by 7. Then, we need to find Q + R where Q is the quotient and R is the remainder when N is divided by 1000.

Hmm. So, N is a four-digit number, meaning it's between 1000 and 9999. I need to find the largest such N where changing any one digit to 1 makes the number divisible by 7.

Wait, let me rephrase that. For N = ABCD (where A, B, C, D are digits), if I change A to 1, or B to 1, or C to 1, or D to 1, each resulting number should be divisible by 7. And N should be the largest four-digit number with this property.

So, the strategy is to find the largest N such that altering any single digit to 1 results in a number divisible by 7. Then, once I have that N, divide it by 1000 to get Q and R, and sum them.

First, I should think about how changing each digit to 1 affects the divisibility by 7.

Let me denote N as a four-digit number: N = 1000*A + 100*B + 10*C + D, where A, B, C, D are digits from 0-9, and A ≠ 0.

When we change each digit to 1, we get four new numbers:

1. Change A to 1: 1BCD = 1000*1 + 100*B + 10*C + D
2. Change B to 1: A1CD = 1000*A + 100*1 + 10*C + D
3. Change C to 1: AB1D = 1000*A + 100*B + 10*1 + D
4. Change D to 1: ABC1 = 1000*A + 100*B + 10*C + 1

Each of these four numbers must be divisible by 7.

So, for each position, changing the digit to 1 gives a number divisible by 7. Let's write equations for each case.

Let me denote the original number as N = 1000A + 100B + 10C + D.

Case 1: Change A to 1:

N1 = 1000 + 100B + 10C + D ≡ 0 mod 7

Case 2: Change B to 1:

N2 = 1000A + 100 + 10C + D ≡ 0 mod 7

Case 3: Change C to 1:

N3 = 1000A + 100B + 10 + D ≡ 0 mod 7

Case 4: Change D to 1:

N4 = 1000A + 100B + 10C + 1 ≡ 0 mod 7

So, each of these N1, N2, N3, N4 must be congruent to 0 modulo 7.

Let me think about how to handle each case.

First, perhaps it's easier to compute each N1, N2, N3, N4 modulo 7 and set them equal to 0, then express in terms of the original digits.

Let me compute the mod 7 of each case.

Case 1: N1 mod 7 = (1000 + 100B + 10C + D) mod 7

But 1000 mod 7: Let me compute that.

7*142=994, so 1000 - 994 = 6. So 1000 ≡ 6 mod7.

Similarly, 100 mod7: 100 ÷7 is 14*7=98, so 100 ≡ 2 mod7.

10 mod7 is 3.

1 mod7 is 1.

So, N1 mod7 = (6 + 2B + 3C + D) mod7 = 0

Case 2: N2 mod7 = (1000A + 100 + 10C + D) mod7

As above, 1000 ≡6, 100≡2, 10≡3, 1≡1.

So N2 mod7 = (6A + 2 + 3C + D) mod7 =0

Case3: N3 mod7 = (1000A + 100B + 10 + D) mod7

Which is (6A + 2B + 3 + D) mod7 =0

Case4: N4 mod7 = (1000A + 100B + 10C +1) mod7

Which is (6A + 2B + 3C +1) mod7 =0

So, now we have four congruences:

1. 6 + 2B + 3C + D ≡0 mod7 → 2B +3C + D ≡ -6 ≡1 mod7

2. 6A + 2 + 3C + D ≡0 mod7 →6A +3C + D ≡ -2 ≡5 mod7

3. 6A + 2B +3 + D ≡0 mod7 →6A +2B + D ≡ -3 ≡4 mod7

4. 6A +2B +3C +1 ≡0 mod7 →6A +2B +3C ≡ -1 ≡6 mod7

So, four equations:

(1) 2B +3C + D ≡1 mod7

(2) 6A +3C + D ≡5 mod7

(3) 6A +2B + D ≡4 mod7

(4) 6A +2B +3C ≡6 mod7

So, let me write these as:

Equation (1): 2B +3C + D = 1 +7k1

Equation (2): 6A +3C + D =5 +7k2

Equation (3): 6A +2B + D =4 +7k3

Equation (4): 6A +2B +3C =6 +7k4

Where k1, k2, k3, k4 are integers.

Hmm, maybe I can subtract equations to eliminate variables. Let's see.

First, subtract equation (1) from equation (2):

Equation (2) - Equation (1):

(6A +3C + D) - (2B +3C + D) = (5 -1) +7(k2 -k1)

Simplify:

6A -2B =4 +7(k2 -k1)

Divide both sides by 2:

3A - B =2 + (7/2)(k2 -k1)

Wait, but 7/2 isn't integer, so perhaps better not to divide.

Let me write it as 6A -2B ≡4 mod7.

Because 7*(k2 -k1) is 0 mod7. So:

6A -2B ≡4 mod7.

I can simplify this equation by dividing all terms by 2 (since 2 and 7 are coprime, this is allowed):

3A - B ≡2 mod7.

Let me note that down as equation (5):

(5) 3A - B ≡2 mod7.

Now, let's subtract equation (3) from equation (2):

Equation (2) - Equation (3):

(6A +3C + D) - (6A +2B + D) = (5 -4) +7(k2 -k3)

Simplify:

3C -2B =1 +7(k2 -k3)

So, 3C -2B ≡1 mod7.

Let me note this as equation (6):

(6) 3C -2B ≡1 mod7.

Similarly, subtract equation (3) from equation (4):

Equation (4) - Equation (3):

(6A +2B +3C) - (6A +2B + D) = (6 -4) +7(k4 -k3)

Simplify:

3C - D =2 +7(k4 -k3)

Thus,

3C - D ≡2 mod7.

Equation (7): 3C - D ≡2 mod7.

Now, subtract equation (1) from equation (4):

Equation (4) - Equation (1):

(6A +2B +3C) - (2B +3C + D) = (6 -1) +7(k4 -k1)

Simplify:

6A - D =5 +7(k4 -k1)

So,

6A - D ≡5 mod7.

Equation (8): 6A - D ≡5 mod7.

So now we have equations (5), (6), (7), (8):

(5) 3A - B ≡2 mod7

(6) 3C -2B ≡1 mod7

(7) 3C - D ≡2 mod7

(8) 6A - D ≡5 mod7

Let me see if I can express some variables in terms of others.

From equation (5):

3A - B ≡2 mod7 → B ≡3A -2 mod7.

From equation (8):

6A - D ≡5 mod7 → D ≡6A -5 mod7.

From equation (7):

3C - D ≡2 mod7 → 3C ≡ D +2 mod7.

But from equation (8), D ≡6A -5 mod7, so substituting:

3C ≡ (6A -5) +2 mod7 → 3C ≡6A -3 mod7.

Divide both sides by 3 (since 3 and 7 are coprime):

C ≡2A -1 mod7.

So, C ≡2A -1 mod7.

From equation (6):

3C -2B ≡1 mod7.

We have expressions for B and C in terms of A.

Substitute C ≡2A -1 and B ≡3A -2 into equation (6):

3*(2A -1) -2*(3A -2) ≡1 mod7.

Compute:

6A -3 -6A +4 ≡1 mod7.

Simplify:

(6A -6A) + (-3 +4) ≡1 mod7 → 0 +1 ≡1 mod7.

So, 1 ≡1 mod7. Which is always true.

So, no new information from equation (6). So, the key equations are (5), (7), (8), and (1).

So, the variables are expressed in terms of A:

B ≡3A -2 mod7,

C ≡2A -1 mod7,

D ≡6A -5 mod7.

So, since A, B, C, D are digits (0-9, with A ≥1), we can write:

B = (3A -2) mod7,

C = (2A -1) mod7,

D = (6A -5) mod7.

But since B, C, D must be digits (0-9), the expressions (3A-2), (2A-1), (6A-5) must be adjusted to be within 0-9.

Wait, but perhaps more accurately, B, C, D can be any digit, but must satisfy the congruence relations.

So, for each A (from 1 to 9), B, C, D
