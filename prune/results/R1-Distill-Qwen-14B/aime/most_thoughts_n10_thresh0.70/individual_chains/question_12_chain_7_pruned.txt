Okay, so I've got this math problem here about a 2x3 grid where I have to place digits in each cell. The conditions are that when I read the numbers left to right in each row, their sum should be 999. And when I read the numbers top to bottom in each column, their sum should be 99. Hmm, that sounds a bit tricky, but let's try to break it down.

First, let me visualize the grid. It's a 2x3 grid, so there are two rows and three columns. Each cell will have a digit from 0 to 9, right? So each cell can be 0 through 9. 

Let me denote the grid cells with variables. Let's say the first row has cells a, b, c, and the second row has cells d, e, f. So the grid looks like this:

a | b | c
d | e | f

Now, when reading left to right, the first row forms the number abc, which is a three-digit number. Similarly, the second row forms def, another three-digit number. Their sum is 999.

So, mathematically, this means:
100a + 10b + c + 100d + 10e + f = 999. 

Let me write that as equation (1): 100a + 10b + c + 100d + 10e + f = 999.

Next, the sum of the numbers formed by reading top to bottom in each column should be 99. Each column is a two-digit number. So the first column is ad, the second is be, and the third is cf. Their sum is 99.

So, mathematically, this is:
10a + d + 10b + e + 10c + f = 99. 

Let me write that as equation (2): 10a + d + 10b + e + 10c + f = 99.

Now, I have two equations: equation (1) and equation (2). Let me see if I can subtract one from the other or do something to eliminate variables.

Let me subtract equation (2) from equation (1):

(100a + 10b + c + 100d + 10e + f) - (10a + d + 10b + e + 10c + f) = 999 - 99.

Calculating the left side:

100a - 10a = 90a

10b - 10b = 0

c - 10c = -9c

100d - d = 99d

10e - e = 9e

f - f = 0

So, the left side becomes: 90a -9c +99d +9e.

The right side is 900.

So, 90a -9c +99d +9e = 900.

Let me factor out the 9:

9*(10a - c + 11d + e) = 900.

Divide both sides by 9:

10a - c + 11d + e = 100. 

Let me write that as equation (3): 10a - c + 11d + e = 100.

Hmm, equation (3) is a key equation. Let's see if I can use this to find relationships between variables.

Looking back at equation (2):
10a + d + 10b + e + 10c + f = 99.

I can rearrange this to group similar terms:

10a + 10b + 10c + d + e + f = 99.

Wait, that can be written as 10*(a + b + c) + (d + e + f) = 99.

So, equation (2) can be written as:

10*(a + b + c) + (d + e + f) = 99.

Let me call that equation (2a): 10*(a + b + c) + (d + e + f) = 99.

Also, equation (1) is 100a + 10b + c + 100d + 10e + f = 999.

Similarly, equation (1) can be written as 100*(a + d) + 10*(b + e) + (c + f) = 999.

Wait, that might not be as helpful. Alternatively, perhaps I can think of equation (1) as:

(100a + 10b + c) + (100d + 10e + f) = 999.

Let me denote the top row number as N = 100a + 10b + c, and the bottom row number as M = 100d + 10e + f.

So, equation (1) is N + M = 999.

Similarly, equation (2) is 10a + d + 10b + e + 10c + f = 99.

Which can be written as 10*(a + b + c) + (d + e + f) = 99.

Let me denote S = a + b + c and T = d + e + f.

So, equation (2a): 10S + T = 99.

So, equation (2a) becomes 10S + T = 99.

And from equation (1), N + M = 999.

But N and M are three-digit numbers. So, N is between 0 and 999, and same with M. Wait, but N and M can be 000 to 999? Well, technically, but in reality, if a digit is 0, the number could have leading zeros. But in this problem, I think leading zeros are allowed because the example given has 008 in the top row.

So, N and M can be from 000 to 999, which are three-digit numbers, possibly with leading zeros. So, they can be 0 to 999 inclusive.

So, N + M = 999.

Thus, N = 999 - M.

Wait, but since both N and M are three-digit numbers, their sum is 999. So, the maximum value for each is 999, but when added together, they can't exceed 1998, but in this case, their sum is exactly 999.

So, N and M are numbers such that each is less than or equal to 999, and their sum is 999.

But how does this help me? Maybe I should find the relation between S and T.

From equation (2a): 10S + T = 99.

So, 10S + T = 99.

Which means T = 99 - 10S.

But S is the sum of the first row's digits: a + b + c. Since each digit is between 0 and 9, S can be from 0 to 27.

Similarly, T is the sum of the digits in the second row: d + e + f, so T can be from 0 to 27.

But from equation (2a), 10S + T = 99. So, T = 99 -10S.

Since T must be non-negative, 99 -10S ≥ 0 → 10S ≤99 → S ≤9.9. But S is integer, so S ≤9.

Similarly, since T must be non-negative, 99 -10S ≥0 → S ≤9.9 → S ≤9.

Moreover, T must be ≤27. So, 99 -10S ≤27 → 10S ≥72 → S ≥7.2. Since S is integer, S ≥8.

So S can be 8 or 9.

Let me consider possible S values:

Case 1: S =8

Then, T =99 -10*8 =99 -80=19.

Case 2: S=9

T=99 -10*9=99-90=9.

So, S can be 8 or 9, and T correspondingly is 19 or 9.

So, now, for each of these cases, we can analyze further.

But first, let's see what else we can do.

From equation (3): 10a -c +11d +e =100.

Hmm, that equation relates a, c, d, e.

Let me see. Is there a way to relate this to S and T? S is a + b + c=8 or 9, and T=d + e + f=19 or 9.

Wait, but equation (3):10a -c +11d +e=100.

Let me see if I can express this in terms of S and T or other variables.

Alternatively, maybe we can find expressions for certain variables.

Wait, equation (3):

10a -c +11d +e =100.

Let me rearrange this:

10a +11d +e -c =100.

Hmm, not sure if that helps. Maybe I can express e in terms of other variables.

e = 100 -10a -11d +c.

But e is a digit, so e must be between 0 and9. So, 0 ≤ e ≤9.

Thus,

0 ≤ 100 -10a -11d +c ≤9.

Which can be written as:

100 -10a -11d +c ≥0 → 10a +11d ≤100 +c.

And,

100 -10a -11d +c ≤9 → 10a +11d ≥91 +c.

But c is a digit between 0 and9, so 91 +c can be from 91 to 100.

So, 10a +11d is between 91 and 100 +c, which is up to 109.

But 10a +11d must be an integer. Since a and d are digits (0-9), 10a can be 0-90, and 11d can be 0-99 (if d=9, 11*9=99). But since d is a digit, 11d can be 0,11,22,...,99.

Wait, but 10a +11d must be at least 91 +c, which is 91 to 100.

So, 10a +11d is between 91 and 109.

But a and d can only go up to 9, so 10a can be 90, 11d can be 99, making 10a +11d= 189, but that's way above 109. So, perhaps the upper limit is 10a +11d ≤100 +c, but since c is up to 9, 10a +11d can be up to 109.

Wait, but 10a +11d can go up to 90 +99=189, but equation (3) says that 10a +11d + (e -c) =100. Hmm, not sure.

Maybe I should consider specific cases based on S=8 and S=9.

Let me first handle Case 1: S=8, T=19.

So, a + b + c =8.

And, d + e + f=19.

Also, equation (3): 10a -c +11d +e=100.

So, 10a -c +11d +e=100.

I need to find integers a, b, c, d, e, f (each from 0 to9) that satisfy these conditions.

Hmm, maybe I can express e from equation (3):

e = 100 -10a +c -11d.

But since e must be between 0 and9, let's plug in the possible values.

So, 0 ≤100 -10a +c -11d ≤9.

Which can be rewritten as:

10a -11d +c ≤100,

and,

10a -11d +c ≥91.

So, 10a -11d +c is between 91 and100.

But a, d are digits (0-9), c is a digit (0-9).

Let me think of variables a and d. Let me denote x=a, y=d.

So, 10x -11y +c is between 91 and100.

But c is between0 and9, so 10x -11y must be between 91 -9=82 and100 -0=100.

So, 82 ≤10x -11y ≤100.

But x and y are digits (0-9). So, let's find all possible x and y such that 10x -11y is between82 and100.

Wait, let's write 10x -11y =k, where k is an integer between82 and100.

We can think of this as 10x = k +11y.

Which implies that k +11y must be divisible by10, since x must be integer.

So, k +11y ≡0 mod10.

But 11y mod10 is same as y mod10, because 11≡1
