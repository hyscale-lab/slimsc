Okay, so I have this problem about counting the number of paths on an 8x8 grid. The paths are from the lower left corner to the upper right corner, have a length of 16, and change direction exactly four times. Hmm, let me try to understand what this means and how to approach it.

First, I know that on a grid, moving from the lower left to the upper right means moving 8 steps to the right and 8 steps up, totaling 16 steps. So any path is a sequence of right (R) and up (U) moves, without changing direction more than four times.

Wait, changing direction exactly four times. So, every time the path switches from moving right to up or up to right, that's a direction change. For example, if a path goes RRRUUURRRUUURRRUUURRR, that's a path with several direction changes. But I need exactly four direction changes.

Let me think about how direction changes relate to the number of runs. A run is a consecutive sequence of the same move. So, each time the direction changes, a new run begins. So, if a path has exactly four direction changes, that means it has five runs in total. Because the number of runs is one more than the number of direction changes.

So, number of runs = number of direction changes + 1. Since we have four direction changes, that's five runs.

Now, each run alternates between Right (R) and Up (U). So, the path could start with R, then U, then R, then U, then R, or it could start with U, then R, then U, then R, then U. So, there are two cases to consider: starting with R or starting with U.

Wait, but on an 8x8 grid, is it possible for a path starting with U to end correctly at the upper right corner? Let me see. The total steps must be 8 R's and 8 U's. If the path starts with U, then ends with R, because there's an even number of runs. Hmm, wait, the number of runs is five, which is odd. So, if it starts with U, the runs would be U, R, U, R, U. That's five runs, starting and ending with U. But the last step should be R because the upper right corner is (8,8), so the last move must be R or U? Wait, no, the path can end with either, as long as the total steps are 8 R and 8 U.

Wait, actually, the starting point is (0,0), and the endpoint is (8,8). So, the path must consist of exactly 8 R's and 8 U's. So, the number of runs of R's and U's must add up to 8 each.

So, if the path has five runs, starting with R, the runs would be R, U, R, U, R. So, three R runs and two U runs. Then, the sum of the lengths of the R runs must be 8, and the sum of the lengths of the U runs must be 8.

Similarly, if the path starts with U, the runs would be U, R, U, R, U. So, three U runs and two R runs. Again, the sum of each type must be 8.

So, for each case (starting with R or starting with U), we can model the problem as partitioning the 8 steps into the respective number of runs.

So, for the starting with R case, we have three runs of R's and two runs of U's.

Each run must have at least 1 step because you can't have a run of zero. So, for the R runs, we have three runs adding up to 8. The number of ways to partition 8 into 3 positive integers is the same as the number of integer solutions to a + b + c = 8, where a, b, c ≥ 1. Similarly for the U runs: two runs adding up to 8, so d + e = 8, d, e ≥ 1.

The number of ways to partition n into k positive integers is C(n-1, k-1). So, for the R runs, it's C(8-1, 3-1) = C(7,2) = 21. For the U runs, it's C(8-1, 2-1) = C(7,1) = 7. So, the number of such paths starting with R is 21 * 7 = 147.

Similarly, for the starting with U case, we have three U runs and two R runs. The number of ways is the same because it's symmetric. So, it's also 21 * 7 = 147.

So, the total number of paths is 147 + 147 = 294.

Wait, but is this correct? Let me double-check.

Wait, the direction changes are exactly four. Each time the direction changes, a new run starts. So, if I have five runs, that implies four direction changes. But let's make sure that the starting direction affects the number of direction changes.

Yes, starting with R or U will both have five runs, which correspond to four direction changes. So, that part seems correct.

Another way to think about it: the number of direction changes is equal to the number of times the direction switches. So, if we have a run sequence like R U R U R U R, that would be 3 direction changes, right? Because each switch is a change. Wait, no, wait: R U R U R U R would have 6 direction changes because each switch from R to U or U to R counts as one. Wait, no, wait, no. Wait, if you have a sequence like R U R, that's two direction changes: R to U, then U to R. So, the number of direction changes is the number of times the direction switches, which is equal to (number of runs - 1). So, for five runs, four direction changes. So that makes sense.

So, for each starting direction (R or U), and five runs, which is four direction changes, the count is 147 each, totaling 294.

But wait, is there a possibility that the number of runs is different? Or have I misapplied the formula somewhere?

Wait, another approach: the problem is similar to counting the number of lattice paths with exactly k direction changes. I remember that in combinatorics, the number of such paths can be computed using combinations.

So, let me recall that formula. For a grid from (0,0) to (m,n), the number of paths with exactly k direction changes is given by... Hmm, I think it's something like 2 * C(m-1, a) * C(n-1, b), where a and b depend on the number of runs.

Wait, perhaps another way: for exactly four direction changes, which implies five runs. Each run alternates between R and U. So, starting with R, we have three R runs and two U runs. The number of ways to arrange the steps is the product of the number of compositions for R and U runs.

Wait, compositions are the same as partitions into positive integers, right. So, for R, which has three runs, each run has at least one step. So, the number of compositions is C(8-
