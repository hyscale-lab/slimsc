Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the number of intersections between two graphs. The functions are given as:

1. \( y = 4 g(f(\sin(2\pi x))) \)
2. \( x = 4 g(f(\cos(3\pi y))) \)

And the functions \( f \) and \( g \) are defined as:

- \( f(x) = ||x| - \frac{1}{2}| \)
- \( g(x) = ||x| - \frac{1}{4}| \)

Hmm, okay. So, first, I need to understand what these functions \( f \) and \( g \) look like. They are absolute value functions, so they'll create V-shaped graphs, but with some transformations.

Let me start by analyzing \( f(x) = ||x| - 1/2| \). Breaking this down:

1. The innermost part is \( |x| \), which is a V-shape with the vertex at (0,0).
2. Then, subtracting 1/2: \( |x| - 1/2 \). This would shift the graph down by 1/2, but since it's an absolute value, it won't go below the x-axis. So, actually, the vertex would be at (0, -1/2), but since we're taking the absolute value, it'll flip anything negative back up. So, this creates a W-shape? Wait, maybe not. Let me think.

Wait, no, more accurately, \( | |x| - 1/2 | \) is equivalent to taking \( |x| \), shifting it down by 1/2, and then taking the absolute value again. So, the graph of \( |x| \) is a V. Subtracting 1/2 would shift it down, so the vertex goes to (0, -1/2). Then, taking the absolute value of that would reflect any negative parts back up.

So, where does \( |x| - 1/2 \) equal negative? When \( |x| < 1/2 \). So, the original \( |x| \) is between 0 and 1/2 in this region. Subtracting 1/2 will make it negative. Therefore, the absolute value of that will be \( (1/2 - |x|) \) in that interval.

So, the graph of \( f(x) \) is a V-shape that is "folded" at \( x = \pm 1/2 \). It goes up on either side beyond \( x = \pm 1/2 \). So, it's a W shape? Because the middle is inverted.

Wait, let me plot some points to visualize:

- At x=0: f(0) = ||0| - 1/2| = | -1/2 | = 1/2.
- At x=1/2: f(1/2) = ||1/2| -1/2| = |1/2 -1/2|=0.
- At x=1: f(1) = ||1| -1/2| = |1 -1/2|=1/2.
- Similarly, at x=-1/2: same as x=1/2, which is 0.
- So, the graph is a V-shape that's been folded at x=±1/2. So, from x=0 to x=1/2, it's a line going from 1/2 down to 0 at x=1/2. Then from x=1/2 to x=1, it goes back up to 1/2. So, it's like a tent shape, with a dip at x=±1/2.

Similarly, for \( g(x) = ||x| - 1/4| \), the same logic applies.

Breaking down \( g(x) \):

1. Start with \( |x| \).
2. Subtract 1/4: \( |x| - 1/4 \).
3. Take absolute value: \( ||x| - 1/4| \).

So, where is \( |x| - 1/4 \) negative? When \( |x| < 1/4 \). So, the function \( g(x) \) will be \( 1/4 - |x| \) in that interval and \( |x| - 1/4 \) otherwise.

So, similar to \( f(x) \), but with the dip at x=±1/4.

Let me sketch the graphs mentally:

- For \( g(x) \), at x=0, g(0)=1/4.
- At x=1/4, g(1/4)=0.
- At x=1/2, g(1/2)=|1/2 - 1/4|=1/4.
- So, it's a V-shape that's folded at x=±1/4, creating a dip there.

So, both \( f \) and \( g \) are piecewise linear functions with vertices at ±1/2 and ±1/4 respectively.

Now, the functions in the problem involve compositions of these functions. Let's look at each side step by step.

Starting with \( y = 4 g(f(\sin(2\pi x))) \).

Let me break it down:

1. Innermost function is \( \sin(2\pi x) \). The sine function has a period of \( 2\pi \), but here it's \( 2\pi x \), so the period is 1. So, it's a sine wave that completes a full cycle every 1 unit along the x-axis.

2. Then, this is fed into \( f \): \( f(\sin(2\pi x)) = || \sin(2\pi x) | - 1/2 | \).

3. Then, this result is fed into \( g \): \( g(f(\sin(2\pi x))) = || || \sin(2\pi x) | -1/2 | - 1/4 | \).

4. Finally, multiplied by 4: \( y = 4 \times \) that expression.

Similarly, for the other equation \( x = 4 g(f(\cos(3\pi y))) \):

1. The innermost function is \( \cos(3\pi y) \). The cosine function has a period of \( 2\pi \), so here, the period is \( 2\pi / 3\pi \) = 2/3. So, it completes a cycle every 2/3 units along the y-axis.

2. Then, \( f(\cos(3\pi y)) = || \cos(3\pi y) | - 1/2 | \).

3. Then, \( g(f(\cos(3\pi y))) = || || \cos(3\pi y) | -1/2 | - 1/4 | \).

4. Multiply by 4: \( x = 4 \times \) that expression.

So, both equations involve these nested functions, and the outputs are scaled by 4.

Since we're dealing with \( \sin \) and \( \cos \) functions, their outputs are between -1 and 1. But since we take absolute values, the inner functions will be between 0 and 1.

So, the innermost functions \( \sin(2\pi x) \) and \( \cos(3\pi y) \) range between -1 and 1. Taking absolute values, they become between 0 and 1.

Then, \( f \) is applied: for an input between 0 and 1, \( f(x) = ||x| - 1/2| \).

Since x is already non-negative (because of the absolute value), \( f(x) = |x - 1/2| \).

Wait, because \( |x| = x \) since x is between 0 and
