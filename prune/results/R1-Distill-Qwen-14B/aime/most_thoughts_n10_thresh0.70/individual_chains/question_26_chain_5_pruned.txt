Okay, so I have this geometry problem here, and I need to find the length of AP in the given triangle setup. Let me try to visualize and break it down step by step.

First, the problem says that triangle ABC is inscribed in a circle ω. The tangents to ω at points B and C intersect at point D. Then, the line AD intersects ω again at point P. We're given the lengths AB = 5, BC = 9, and AC = 10. We need to find AP in the form m/n where m and n are coprime, and then find m + n.

Hmm, okay. Let me draw a rough sketch in my mind. Triangle ABC with AB=5, BC=9, AC=10. So, it's a scalene triangle. The circle ω is the circumcircle of ABC. The tangents at B and C meet at D. Then AD meets ω again at P. So, P is another intersection point of AD with ω.

I remember that when dealing with tangents to a circle, the tangent at a point is perpendicular to the radius at that point. So, the tangent at B is perpendicular to OB, and the tangent at C is perpendicular to OC, where O is the center of ω. But I'm not sure if O is needed here. Maybe there's another approach.

Wait, point D is the intersection of the two tangents. So, D lies outside the circle ω. Then, AD is a line from A through D, intersecting ω again at P. So, P is the second intersection point. Hmm.

Since D is the intersection of the two tangents, BD and CD are tangent to ω. So, BD = CD because the lengths of tangents from a common external point to a circle are equal. So, triangle BDC is isoceles with BD = CD.

I think power of a point might be useful here. The power of point D with respect to ω is equal to DB² = DC², since DB and DC are tangents. Also, since AD passes through ω at A and P, power of D gives DA * DP = DB². So, DA * DP = DB².

That seems promising. So, if I can find DA, and DB, then I can solve for DP, and then AP would be AD + DP or something? Wait, let me think.

Wait, AP is the segment from A to P, which is on ω. So, AP is just a chord of ω. But how does that relate? Hmm.

Wait, power of point D with respect to ω is DB² = DC² = DA * DP. So, if I can compute DB, then I can relate DA and DP.

But do I know DB? Hmm. I don't know the coordinates or the exact position of D. So, maybe I need another way to compute DB.

Alternatively, maybe I can use some triangle properties or similar triangles.

Wait, let me think about the triangle ABC with sides 5, 9, 10. Maybe I can compute some angles or other lengths using the Law of Cos
