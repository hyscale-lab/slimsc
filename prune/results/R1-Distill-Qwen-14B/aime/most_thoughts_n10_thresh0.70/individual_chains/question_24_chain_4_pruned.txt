Okay, so I've got this math problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's see what it says.

Alright, the problem is about a list of positive integers with three specific properties. I need to find the sum of the squares of all the items in the list. Let me break down the properties one by one.

First, the sum of all the items is 30. That's straightforward. So whatever numbers are in the list, when I add them up, they should total 30.

Next, the unique mode of the list is 9. Hmm, mode is the number that appears most frequently. So 9 has to appear more times than any other number in the list. And it's unique, meaning no other number can share that mode status; they all have to appear fewer times than 9.

Thirdly, the median of the list is a positive integer that does not appear in the list itself. Wait, the median is a positive integer, but it's not in the list. That's interesting. So if I have an odd number of elements, the median is the middle number. If it's even, the median is the average of the two middle numbers. But in this case, the median is a positive integer not present in the list. So if the median is an integer, that suggests that maybe the two middle numbers when averaged give an integer, but that integer isn't in the list.

Let me think about the structure of the list. Let's denote the number of elements as 'n'. Since the median is not in the list, it must be that for an odd 'n', the middle element is not 9, but wait, the mode is 9, so 9 must appear multiple times. So perhaps the list is arranged such that the median is between two 9s or something else.

Wait, let's think of the possible cases based on the number of elements.

First, the number of elements could be even or odd. Let's consider both.

But let's think about the mode. Since 9 is the unique mode, it has to appear more times than any other number. So at least twice, but maybe more.

Let me try to find a possible list that meets all the conditions.

Let me start by considering the minimum number of elements. Since the mode is 9, which appears more than any other number, we need at least two 9s. Let's see.

But wait, the median is an integer not in the list. So for example, if the list is even in length, say n=6, then the median is the average of the 3rd and 4th terms. So if those two terms are both 8, then the median would be 8, but then 8 would appear more than once, which might interfere with the mode being 9. Alternatively, if the two middle terms average to something else.

Wait, but the median is a positive integer not in the list. So maybe the two middle numbers are such that their average is an integer, but that integer is not present in the list.

Alternatively, for an odd number of elements, say n=5. The median is the 3rd term. If the 3rd term is, say,
