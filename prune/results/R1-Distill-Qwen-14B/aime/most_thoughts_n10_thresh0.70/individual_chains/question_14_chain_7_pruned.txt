Alright, so I've got this math problem here. Let me read it again and make sure I understand what's being asked.

The problem says: Let N be the greatest four-digit positive integer with the property that whenever one of its digits is changed to 1, the resulting number is divisible by 7. Then, Q and R are the quotient and remainder when N is divided by 1000. I need to find Q + R.

Hmm, okay. So N is a four-digit number, the largest possible, such that changing any one of its digits to 1 makes the entire number divisible by 7. Then, divide N by 1000 and add the quotient and remainder.

Alright, let me break this down. First, find N. Then, compute Q and R, and then add them.

Starting with N. N is a four-digit number, so it ranges from 1000 to 9999. We need the greatest such number with the given property.

The property: changing any one digit to 1 results in a number divisible by 7. So, for N, which is a four-digit number, let's denote its digits as a, b, c, d, where a is the thousands digit, b the hundreds, c the tens, and d the units digit.

So N = 1000a + 100b + 10c + d.

The condition is that if we change any one digit to 1, the resulting number is divisible by 7. So, for each digit position, changing it to 1 should give a number that's a multiple of 7.

Which means, for each digit position i (where i is thousands, hundreds, tens, or units), replacing the digit at position i with 1 gives a number divisible by 7.

So, for N, we can write four equations, each corresponding to replacing one digit with 1.

But since N is the greatest such number, we probably want it as large as possible. So, we should try to maximize the digits starting from the thousands place, then hundreds, etc., while satisfying the given condition.

Let me think about the implications of the condition.

Let me denote N as abcd, where a, b, c, d are digits (0-9, a ≠ 0).

So, the number is 1000a + 100b + 10c + d.

When we change a to 1: 1000*1 + 100b + 10c + d must be divisible by 7.

Similarly, changing b to 1: 1000a + 100*1 + 10c + d must be divisible by 7.

Changing c to 1: 1000a + 100b + 10*1 + d must be divisible by 7.

Changing d to 1: 1000a + 100b + 10c + 1 must be divisible by 7.

So, each of these four numbers must be divisible by 7.

Let me write these conditions as equations.

Let me denote the original number as N.

1. When a is changed to 1: N1 = 1000*1 + 100b + 10c + d = 1000 + 100b + 10c + d.

N1 ≡ 0 mod 7.

2. When b is changed to 1: N2 = 1000a + 100*1 + 10c + d = 1000a + 100 + 10c + d.

N2 ≡ 0 mod 7.

3. When c is changed to 1: N3 = 1000a + 100b + 10*1 + d = 1000a + 100b + 10 + d.

N3 ≡ 0 mod 7.

4. When d is changed to 1: N4 = 1000a + 100b + 10c + 1.

N4 ≡ 0 mod 7.

So, we have four conditions:

1. 1000 + 100b + 10c + d ≡ 0 mod 7.

2. 1000a + 100 + 10c + d ≡ 0 mod 7.

3. 1000a + 100b + 10 + d ≡ 0 mod 7.

4. 1000a + 100b + 10c + 1 ≡ 0 mod 7.

Hmm, okay. Let me compute each of these modulo 7.

First, 1000 mod 7. Let me calculate 1000 / 7: 7*142 = 994, so 1000 mod 7 is 1000 - 994 = 6.

Similarly, 100 mod 7: 7*14=98, so 100 mod 7 is 2.

10 mod 7 is 3.

1 mod 7 is 1.

So, let's rewrite each condition.

1. 6 + 2b + 3c + d ≡ 0 mod 7.

2. (6a) + 2 + 3c + d ≡ 0 mod 7.

3. 6a + 2b + 3 + d ≡ 0 mod 7.

4. 6a + 2b + 3c + 1 ≡ 0 mod 7.

Wait, that's because:

For condition 1: 1000 mod 7 is 6, and 100b mod 7 is 2b, 10c mod 7 is 3c, d mod7 is d. So 6 + 2b + 3c + d ≡0 mod7.

Similarly, for condition 2: 1000a mod7 is 6a, 100 mod7 is 2, 10c mod7 is 3c, d mod7 is d. So 6a + 2 + 3c + d ≡0 mod7.

Condition 3: 1000a mod7 is 6a, 100b mod7 is 2b, 10 mod7 is 3, d mod7 is d. So 6a + 2b +3 + d ≡0 mod7.

Condition4: 1000a mod7 is 6a, 100b mod7 is 2b, 10c mod7 is3c, 1 mod7 is1. So 6a +2b +3c +1 ≡0 mod7.

So now we have four equations:

1. 6 + 2b + 3c + d ≡0 mod7.

2. 6a + 2 + 3c + d ≡0 mod7.

3. 6a + 2b +3 + d ≡0 mod7.

4. 6a + 2b +3c +1 ≡0 mod7.

Hmm, okay. Let me see if I can subtract some equations to eliminate variables.

Let me subtract equation 1 from equation 2:

Equation 2 - Equation1:

(6a + 2 + 3c + d) - (6 + 2b + 3c + d) = 6a +2 +3c +d -6 -2b -3c -d = 6a -2b -4 ≡0 mod7.

So, 6a - 2b -4 ≡0 mod7.

Which can be written as 6a -2b ≡4 mod7.

Alternatively, 6a -2b ≡4 mod7.

Let me note this as equation 5.

Similarly, subtract equation 3 from equation2:

Equation2 - Equation3:

(6a +2 +3c +d) - (6a +2b +3 +d) = 6a +2 +3c +d -6a -2b -3 -d = 2 -2b +3c -3 = (2-3) + (-2b +3c) = -1 -2b +3c ≡0 mod7.

So, -1 -2b +3c ≡0 mod7.

Which can be written as 3c -2b ≡1 mod7.

Let me call this equation 6.

Similarly, subtract equation3 from equation4:

Equation4 - Equation3:

(6a +2b +3c +1) - (6a +2b +3 +d) = 6a +2b +3c +1 -6a -2b -3 -d = 3c +1 -3 -d = 3c -2 -d ≡0 mod7.

So, 3c - d ≡2 mod7.

Let me note this as equation7.

And subtract equation1 from equation4:

Equation4 - Equation1:

(6a +2b +3c +1) - (6 +2b +3c +d) = 6a +2b +3c +1 -6 -2b -3c -d = 6a -5 -d ≡0 mod7.

So, 6a -d ≡5 mod7.

That's equation8.

Hmm, okay. So now I have four new equations: 5,6,7,8.

Equation5: 6a -2b ≡4 mod7.

Equation6: 3c -2b ≡1 mod7.

Equation7: 3c -d ≡2 mod7.

Equation8: 6a -d ≡5 mod7.

Hmm. Let me see if I can express some variables in terms of others.

Maybe express d from equation7 and equation8.

From equation7: d ≡3c -2 mod7.

From equation8: 6a -d ≡5 mod7 → d ≡6a -5 mod7.

So, since d ≡3c -2 and d≡6a -5, then 3c -2 ≡6a -5 mod7.

Which leads to 3c ≡6a -3 mod7.

Simplify 3c ≡6a -3 mod7.

Divide both sides by 3 (since 3 and 7 are coprime, division is allowed). So c ≡2a -1 mod7.

So, c = (2a -1) +7k, where k is an integer.

Since c is a digit (0-9), we can write c as (2a -1) mod7, but considering it's a digit, it's (2a -1 +7m) for some m such that c is between 0 and 9.

Wait, perhaps better to note that c ≡ (2a -1) mod7. So, for each possible a (1-9 since it's the thousands digit), c can be determined modulo7.

But a is a digit from 1 to 9. Let's see.

Now, let
