Okay, so I need to find the number of rectangles that can be formed inside a regular dodecagon (12-gon) where each side of the rectangle lies on either a side or a diagonal of the dodecagon. Hmm, that sounds a bit tricky, but let me try to break it down.

First, I know a regular dodecagon has 12 sides and is highly symmetrical, so maybe I can use that symmetry to figure out the rectangles. The problem mentions that the sides of the rectangles lie on either a side or a diagonal, so I guess the sides of the rectangles are chords of the dodecagon.

Wait, but how exactly do rectangles form inside a polygon like this? In a regular polygon, a rectangle would require four vertices such that the sides are parallel and equal in length, and the angles are all 90 degrees. But in a regular dodecagon, the sides and diagonals have different lengths, so I need to figure out which sets of four points form rectangles.

I remember that in regular polygons, especially those with a large number of sides, the concept of diameters (lines connecting opposite vertices) and other diagonals can form various shapes. Maybe rectangles are formed by pairs of diameters and pairs of other diagonals that are perpendicular to them.

Let me think about how a rectangle is defined. A rectangle requires two pairs of parallel sides, and all angles are 90 degrees. So, in the case of a regular dodecagon, if I can find two pairs of parallel sides (which would be sides or diagonals of the dodecagon) that are perpendicular to each other, then the figure they form would be a rectangle.

But wait, since the dodecagon is regular, the sides and diagonals can be of different lengths. So, perhaps rectangles can be formed by selecting four points such that the sides of the rectangle are either sides or diagonals of the dodecagon.

Alternatively, maybe it's easier to think in terms of vectors. Each vertex can be considered as a point on a unit circle, spaced at 30-degree increments because 360/12 = 30. So, each vertex is at an angle of 30*k degrees, where k is 0,1,2,...,11.

If I can find four such points that form a rectangle, the vectors representing the sides from one vertex should be equal in length and direction. But wait, no, they should be equal in length and opposite in direction for the sides. Alternatively, for a rectangle, the vectors should satisfy certain conditions.

Wait, maybe a better approach is to think about the properties of rectangles in a regular dodecagon. For a rectangle to exist, its sides must be parallel to two sets of parallel sides or diagonals of the dodecagon, and these two sets must be perpendicular to each other.

In a regular dodecagon, the sides are all of the same length, but diagonals can be of different lengths depending on how many vertices they skip. For example, a diagonal that connects two vertices with one vertex in between is shorter than one that skips more vertices.

So, for the rectangle, I need two pairs of parallel lines (sides or diagonals). These lines must be perpendicular to each other. So, perhaps the sides of the rectangle are made from two different types of diagonals that are perpendicular.

Wait, but in a regular dodecagon, the angles between sides and diagonals can be calculated. Let me see: since each side is 30 degrees apart, the central angles between vertices are multiples of 30 degrees.

So, for two chords to be perpendicular, the angle between them must be 90 degrees. Since each step is 30 degrees, 90 degrees would correspond to 3 steps (because 3*30=90). So, if one diagonal skips k vertices, another diagonal skips m vertices, and the angle between them is 90 degrees, then perhaps k and m satisfy some condition.

Wait, maybe not exactly. Let me think again. The angle between two chords can be found by the difference in their angles. If two vertices are separated by k steps, their chord makes an angle of 15k
