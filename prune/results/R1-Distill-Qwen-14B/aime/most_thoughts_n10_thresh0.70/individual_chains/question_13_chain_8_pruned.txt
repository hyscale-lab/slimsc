Okay, so I have this problem about Aya's morning walk. Let me try to parse it step by step. 

First, it says Aya goes for a 9-kilometer-long walk every morning and stops at a coffee shop afterward. Her walking speed is s kilometers per hour, and when she walks at this speed, the total time she takes, including t minutes in the coffee shop, is 4 hours. 

Then, when she increases her walking speed to s + 2 kilometers per hour, the walk takes her 2 hours and 24 minutes, which still includes the same t minutes in the coffee shop. 

The question is asking, if she walks at s + 1/2 kilometers per hour, how many minutes will the walk take her, including the t minutes at the coffee shop.

Hmm. So, I think I can model this with some equations. Let's denote the time she spends walking as different from the total time which includes the coffee shop. 

Let me break it down. When she walks at speed s, the time she spends walking is 9/s hours, right? Because time is distance divided by speed. But the total time is 4 hours, which includes the t minutes in the coffee shop. So, the time she spends walking is 4 hours minus t minutes.

Wait, but t is in minutes. I should probably convert everything to hours or everything to minutes. Since her walking time will be in hours, maybe I should convert t into hours. Let me see.

Wait, 4 hours is the total time, which is walking time plus t minutes. So, in terms of hours, the total time is 4 hours, which is 4 hours. The walking time is 9/s hours, and the coffee shop time is t minutes, which is t/60 hours. So, the equation would be:

9/s + t/60 = 4.

Similarly, when she walks at s + 2 km/h, the walking time is 9/(s + 2) hours. The total time is 2 hours and 24 minutes. Let me convert that into hours. 24 minutes is 24/60 = 0.4 hours. So, 2.4 hours total. So, the equation would be:

9/(s + 2) + t/60 = 2.4.

So now I have two equations:

1) 9/s + t/60 = 4
2) 9/(s + 2) + t/60 = 2.4

I can subtract the second equation from the first to eliminate t.

So, subtracting equation 2 from equation 1:

[9/s + t/60] - [9/(s + 2) + t/60] = 4 - 2.4

This simplifies to:

9/s - 9/(s + 2) = 1.6

Let me write that as:

9/s - 9/(s + 2) = 1.6

I can combine the fractions on the left:

9*(s + 2) - 9s / [s(s + 2)] = 1.6

Simplify numerator:

9s + 18 - 9s = 18.

So, 18 / [s(s + 2)] = 1.6

So, 18 = 1.6 * s(s + 2)

Let me compute 1.6 * s(s + 2) = 18

1.6 is the same as 8/5, so maybe writing it as fractions might help.

So, 18 = (8/5)*s(s + 2)

Multiply both sides by 5:

90 = 8*s(s + 2)

Divide both sides by 2:

45 = 4*s(s + 2)

Wait, 90 divided by 2 is 45, and 8 divided by 2 is 4. So,

45 = 4s^2 + 8s

Bring all terms to
