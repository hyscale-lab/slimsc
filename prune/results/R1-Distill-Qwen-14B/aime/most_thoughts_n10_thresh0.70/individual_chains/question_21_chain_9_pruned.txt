Okay, so I have this problem here about finding the least integer base b (where b is at least 2) such that there are more than ten b-eautiful integers. Hmm, okay, let me try to wrap my head around this.

First, let's make sure I understand the problem correctly. A positive integer n is called b-eautiful if two conditions are met: 

1. When n is expressed in base b, it has exactly two digits. 
2. The sum of these two digits equals the square root of n.

The example given is 81 being 13-eautiful because when you write 81 in base 13, it's 63₁₃, and 6 + 3 equals 9, which is the square root of 81. Got it.

So, my task is to find the smallest base b (starting from 2 upwards) where the number of b-eautiful integers is more than ten. That means, for each base b, I need to count how many numbers n satisfy those two conditions, and find the smallest b where that count exceeds ten.

Let me break this down step by step.

First, let's figure out what it means for a number n to have exactly two digits in base b. In any base b, a two-digit number is of the form a * b + c, where a and c are digits in base b. Since it's a two-digit number, a can't be zero, and both a and c must be less than b.

So, n = a*b + c, where a and c are integers, 1 ≤ a < b, and 0 ≤ c < b.

The second condition is that a + c = sqrt(n). So, sqrt(n) must be an integer because a and c are integers, and their sum is an integer. Therefore, n must be a perfect square.

So, n must be a perfect square, say k², where k is a positive integer. So, we have:

k² = a*b + c
and
a + c = k

So, substituting c = k - a into the first equation:

k² = a*b + (k - a)
=> k² = a*(b - 1) + k

Let me rearrange this equation:

k² - k = a*(b - 1)

So,

a = (k² - k) / (b - 1)

Since a must be an integer between 1 and b-1 (because it's the first digit of a two-digit number in base b), (k² - k) must be divisible by (b - 1). Also, a must satisfy 1 ≤ a ≤ b-1.

So, for a given base b, I can iterate over possible k's and see if (k² - k) is divisible by (b - 1), and if so, compute a and check if it's within the allowed range. If yes, then n = k² is a b-eautiful number.

Wait, but another way to think about this is for each b, find all k such that (k² - k) is divisible by (b-1), and then a = (k² -k)/(b-1) must be an integer between 1 and b-1.

So, for each b, I can try different k's to find valid a's.

But since I'm looking for the minimal b with more than ten such n's, maybe I can find a pattern or formula for how many solutions exist for a given b.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to fix k and then see for which bases b this k would lead to a valid a.

Wait, but since b is variable, perhaps it's better to fix the base and iterate over possible k's.

Let me try to formalize this.

Given base b:

1. For each possible two-digit number in base b, which is n = a*b + c, with 1 ≤ a < b, 0 ≤ c < b.

2. The sum a + c must equal sqrt(n) = k, so n = k².

So, for each base b, I can iterate over possible a and c such that a + c = k, and then check if a*b + c = k².

Alternatively, for each b, iterate over possible k's, and see if there exists a and c such that a + c = k and a*b + c = k².

Wait, but the second equation can be rewritten as:

c = k² - a*b

But since c must equal k - a (from the sum), we have:

k - a = k² - a*b
=> a*b - a = k² - k
=> a*(b-1) = k² - k
