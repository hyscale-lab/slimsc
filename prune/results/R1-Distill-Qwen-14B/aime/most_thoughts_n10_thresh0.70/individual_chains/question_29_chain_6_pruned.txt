Okay, so I have this geometry problem here. Let me read it again to make sure I understand all the details.

We have two rectangles, ABCD and EFGH. The points D, E, C, F are collinear. That means they all lie on the same straight line. Also, the points A, D, H, G all lie on a circle. So, those four points are concyclic or lie on the same circumference.

Given lengths: BC is 16, AB is 107, FG is 17, and EF is 184. I need to find the length of CE.

Hmm, okay. Let me try to visualize this setup. I think drawing a diagram might help, but since I can't draw, I'll try to imagine it.

First, let me consider the rectangles. ABCD is a rectangle, so opposite sides are equal. So BC is 16, which would mean AD is also 16. AB is 107, so DC is also 107. Similarly, EFGH is another rectangle, so FG is 17, so EH is also 17. EF is 184, so GH is 184.

Now, the points D, E, C, F are collinear. So, if I imagine the line that passes through D, E, C, F, then these four points lie on it.

Also, A, D, H, G lie on a circle. So, those four points are concyclic. That might imply that certain angles are equal or that some cyclic quadrilateral properties apply.

I think I should assign coordinates to these points to make things clearer. Let me choose a coordinate system where point D is at the origin. So, letâ€™s say D is (0, 0). Since ABCD is a rectangle, and BC is 16, AB is 107, which would mean that AD is 107, right?

Wait, hold on. In a rectangle, adjacent sides are perpendicular. So, AB is one side, BC is another. So, if ABCD is the rectangle, then AB is 107, BC is 16, so the sides are 107 and 16. So, if D is at (0, 0), then C would be at (107, 0). Because DC is 107, right? Then, moving from D upwards, since AD is 16, point A would be at (0, 16). Then, point B would be at (107, 16). Wait, no, because from A, moving along AB, which is 107, but wait, AB is a horizontal side if AD is vertical.

Wait, perhaps I should define the coordinates more carefully. Let me try again.

Let me assign coordinates such that point D is at (0, 0). Since ABCD is a rectangle, and AB is 107, BC is 16.

So, if D is (0, 0), then since DC is 107, point C would be (107, 0). Then, since AD is 16, point A would be at (0, 16). Then point B would be at (107, 16).

Wait, that makes ABCD a rectangle with length 107 and height 16. Correct.

Now, the other rectangle is EFGH. Points D, E, C, F are collinear. So, points D, E, C, F lie on a straight line.

So, let's think about the line that passes through D (0,0) and C (107,0). Wait, but if D and C are both on the x-axis, then E and F must also lie on the x-axis. So, the line is the x-axis itself.

Therefore, E and F are somewhere on the x-axis. Since EFGH is a rectangle, and EF is 184, which is a side. So, EF is a horizontal side
