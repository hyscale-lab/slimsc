Okay, so I have this problem about counting paths on an 8x8 grid. The paths start at the lower left corner and end at the upper right corner, with a total length of 16. They need to change direction exactly four times. Hmm, I'm a bit confused, but let me try to break it down.

First, I remember that in grid path problems, usually, you move either right or up. Since it's an 8x8 grid, to get from the lower left to the upper right, you have to move 8 steps right and 8 steps up, totaling 16 steps. So each path is a sequence of 8 rights (R) and 8 ups (U), arranged in some order.

Now, the problem says the path changes direction exactly four times. Wait, what does that mean? Changing direction would be when the path switches from moving right to up or up to right. So, for example, if a path goes R, R, R, U, U, U, etc., each time it switches from R to U or U to R, that's a direction change.

Let me think about how direction changes relate to the number of segments. Each time the direction changes, a new segment starts. So, if a path changes direction k times, how many segments does it have? Well, if you start with a direction (say, right), each change adds another segment. So, for k changes, the number of segments is k + 1. But wait, that's only if you start with one direction. Let me test this.

Suppose I have a path that goes R, R, R, U, U, U. So from R to U is one change. How many segments? It's two segments: RRR and UUU. So yes, 1 change leads to 2 segments. So, in general, number of segments = number of direction changes + 1.

So, if the path changes direction exactly four times, the number of segments is 5. Each segment is a consecutive sequence of the same direction.

Now, since the path must consist of 8 rights and 8 ups, these 5 segments must be divided into right and up segments. Each segment is either entirely right or entirely up.

So, how can these 5 segments be divided between rights and ups? Well, each segment is either R or U. Since the path starts at the lower left corner (let's say that's the origin (0,0)), and ends at (8,8), the path must start with either R or U. But in an 8x8 grid, to reach (8,8), the path must have both 8 R's and 8 U's.

Wait a second, let me think about this. The path starts at (0,0) and ends at (8,8). So, in terms of directions, it must consist of a series of R and U steps that sum up to 8 in each direction. So, the first segment could be R or U, and the last segment must be the opposite direction of the first. Because if you start with R, you need to end with U, but wait, no. Wait, actually, that's not necessarily true. You can have any number of segments as long as the total R's and U's are 8 each.

But considering that the first segment is either R or U, and each subsequent segment is the opposite direction.

Wait, no, not necessarily. The key here is that each segment is a consecutive run of the same direction. So, the path alternates between R and U segments. So, if the path starts with R, then the segments go R, U, R, U, etc. Similarly, if it starts with U, it's U, R, U, R, etc.

So, given that there are 5 segments, which are alternately R and U, how many ways can we arrange these?

Let me consider two cases: starting with R and starting with U.

Case 1: Starting with R.

Then the segments are R, U, R, U, R. So, the number of R segments is 3, and the number of U segments is 2.

Similarly, Case 2: Starting with U.

Segments are U, R, U, R, U. So, number of U segments is 3, R segments is 2.

So, in both cases, the number of direction changes is 4, leading to 5 segments.

Now, the next step is to determine how to distribute the 8 R's and 8 U's into these segments.

In Case 1: 3 R segments and 2 U segments. Each R segment has at least 1 R, each U segment at least 1 U.

Similarly, in Case 2: 3 U segments and 2 R segments, each with at least 1 step.

So, the problem reduces to finding the number of ways to partition 8 R's into 3 segments (each at least 1) and 8 U's into 2 segments (each at least 1), and vice versa.

Wait, no, actually, it's the other way around. For Case 1, since there are 3 R segments, we have to distribute 8 R's into 3 segments, each at least 1. Similarly, 8 U's into 2 segments, each at least 1.

The number of ways to distribute n identical items into k boxes, each at least 1, is C(n-1, k-1), where C is combination.

So, for R's in Case 1: 8 R's into 3 segments: C(8-1, 3-1) = C(7, 2) = 21.

Similarly, U's in Case 1: 8 U's into 2 segments: C(8-1, 2-1) = C(7, 1) =7.

So, the number of paths in Case 1 is 21 * 7 = 147.

Similarly, for Case 2: starting with U.

Number of U segments: 3, so distributing 8 U's into 3 segments: C(7, 2)=21.

Number of R segments: 2, distributing 8 R's into 2: C(7,1)=7.

So, number of paths in Case 2: 21*7=147.

So, total number of paths with exactly four direction changes is 147 + 147 = 294.

Wait, but hold on, is that the final answer?

Wait, let me think again. The direction changes are exactly four, so each case (starting with R or U) gives the same number of paths, so adding them together gives the total.

So, 147 + 147=294.

Is that correct? Let me see.

Wait, another way to think about this: the number of such paths is 2 * C(7,2) * C(7,1).

Because for each starting direction, you have to choose how to split R's and U's into segments.

Wait, 2 comes from starting with R or U. So, 2 * [C(7,2) * C(7,1)] = 2 *21 *7=294.

So, that seems consistent.

But wait, let me make sure I didn't miss anything else.

Each such path must consist of 5 segments: alternately R and U. Since we have 4 direction changes, that's 5 segments.

Each segment must have at least one step, so the number of ways is the product of the combinations for R and U distributions.

Yes, that's what I did.

So, the answer should be 294.

Wait, but wait a second. Let me think about another way.

Alternative approach: The number of paths with exactly k direction changes is equal to 2 * C(n-1, k/2) * C(m-1, (k+1)/2 -1), but wait, maybe not. Hmm, maybe I should think in terms of compositions.

Wait, a composition of an integer is a way of writing it as the sum of positive integers, where order matters. So, the number of compositions of 8 into 3 parts is C(7,2)=21, same as before.

Similarly, for 8 into 2 parts: C(7,1)=7.

So, the same result.

Therefore, I think 294 is the correct answer.

Wait, but just to be thorough, let me consider a simpler grid to see if this approach holds.

Suppose it's a 2x2 grid, and we want paths that change direction exactly twice.

So, total steps: 4 (2 right, 2 up).

Number of direction changes: 2.

So, according to the earlier method, number of segments: 2 +1=3.

Wait, no, the number of direction changes is 2, so number of segments is 3.

But wait, in a 2x2 grid, can you have 3 segments? Let's see.

A possible path: R, R, U, U. That has one direction change.

Another path: R, U, R, U. That has three direction changes.

Wait, so for 2 direction changes, the number of segments is 3.

So, for a 2x2 grid, how many paths change direction exactly twice?

Let me enumerate them.

Each path is a permutation of R, R, U, U with exactly two direction changes.

Wait, the number of direction changes in a path is the number of times the direction switches. So, for example:

Case 1: R, U, R, U: changes at step 1 to 2 (R to U), step 2 to 3 (U to R), step 3 to 4 (R to U). So three direction changes.

Wait, but wait, in a 2x2 grid, to have exactly two direction changes, the path must have three segments.

Wait, for example: R, R, U, U: segments are R, R, U, U. So, direction changes once (from R to U). So, one change.

Another example: R, U, U, R: segments R, U, U, R. Direction changes at step 1 to 2 (R to U), and step 3 to 4 (U to R). So two direction changes.

Similarly, U, R, R, U: same, two direction changes.

Another example: U, R, U, R: three direction changes.

So, in a 2x2 grid, the number of paths with exactly two direction changes is 2.

How does that compare to the formula?

According to the earlier approach:

Number of direction changes: 2. So number of segments: 3.

So, starting with R: number of R segments and U segments.

If starting with R, then segments are R, U, R. So, R segments: 2, U segments:1.

Wait, no. Wait, 3 segments with starting R would be R, U, R? Wait, that actually makes sense for 2 R segments and 1 U segment. Wait, but in a 2x2 grid, you have 2 R's and 2 U's.

Wait, so if starting with R, 3 segments: R, U, R.

But 2 R's and 1 U? No, that would require distributing 2 R's into 2 segments and 2 U's into 1 segment.

Wait, but 2 R's into 2 segments: each at least 1. So, the number of compositions is C(2-1, 2-1)=C(1,1)=1.

Similarly, 2 U's into 1 segment: only 1 way.

So, number of such paths starting with R:1*1=1.

Similarly, starting with U: segments U, R, U. So, number of U's into 2 segments: C(2-1,2-1)=1. Number of R's into 1 segment: 1. So, 1*1=1.

Total paths: 1+1=2, which matches the enumeration.

So, the formula works here.

So, applying the same formula to the original problem, 8x8 grid, 4 direction changes.

Number of segments: 5.

Starting with R: 3 R segments and 2 U segments.

Number of ways to distribute R's: C(8-1,3-1)=C(7,2)=21.

Number of ways to distribute U's: C(8-1,2-1)=C(7,1)=7.

Total for Case 1:21*7=147.

Similarly, starting with U: same number, 147.

Total paths: 147+147=294.

So, I think 294 is the correct answer.

Wait, but let me verify with another small grid.

Let's take a 1x1 grid. Paths from (0,0) to (1,1). Total steps: 2 (R, U).

Number of direction changes: 1, since you go R then U, or U then R.

But according to our formula, number of direction changes is 1, number of segments is 2.

So, starting with R: segments R, U.

Distribute 1 R into 1 segment: 1 way.

Distribute 1 U into 1 segment:1 way.

So, number of paths: 1*1=1.

Similarly, starting with U: 1*1=1.

Total paths:2, which is correct because there are two paths: RU and UR.

So, the formula works for 1x1 grid.

Another test: 3x3 grid, paths with exactly 2 direction changes.

Number of direction changes: 2.

Number of segments: 3.

So, for starting with R: segments R, U, R.

Number of R's:2 segments, 3 R's.

Distribute 3 R's into 2 segments: C(3-1,2-1)=C(2,1)=2.

Number of U's:1 segment, 3 U's: 1 way.

So, Case 1:2*1=2.

Starting with U: similar, 2*1=2.

Total paths:4.

Let me enumerate all possible paths on 3x3 grid with exactly two direction changes.

Possible paths:

1. R, R, U, U, U: direction changes once.

2. R, U, U, U, R: direction changes twice.

3. R, R, R, U, U: direction changes once.

4. R, U, U, U, R: same as 2.

Wait, no, wait, let me think in terms of sequences.

Wait, 3x3 grid: 3 R's and 3 U's.

Each path must have 3 R's and 3 U's, arranged in some order.

Number of such paths is C(6,3)=20.

But how many have exactly two direction changes?

Wait, perhaps this is getting too complicated, but according to our formula, it's 4. So, let's see.

Wait, the paths with exactly two direction changes must have three segments, either R, U, R or U, R, U.

So, for R, U, R:

We need to distribute 3 R's into 2 segments (each at least 1) and 3 U's into 1 segment.

Number of ways: C(2,1)*1=2*1=2.

Similarly, U, R, U: same, 2*1=2.

Total:4, as per formula.

Yes, so the formula holds.

Therefore, I think my approach is correct.

So, in conclusion, the number of paths is 294.


The problem involves counting the number of paths of length 16 from the lower left to the upper right corner of an 8x8 grid that change direction exactly four times. Each path consists of 8 right (R) and 8 up (U) moves, arranged in segments alternating between R and U. 

To solve this, we consider two cases: paths starting with R and paths starting with U. In both cases, the path changes direction four times, resulting in five segments. For starting with R, there are 3 R segments and 2 U segments. The number of ways to distribute 8 R's into 3 segments is \( \binom{7}{2} = 21 \), and the number of ways to distribute 8 U's into 2 segments is \( \binom{7}{1} = 7 \). Thus, there are \( 21 \times 7 = 147 \) paths starting with R. Similarly, there are 147 paths starting with U. Adding these together gives \( 147 + 147 = 294 \) total paths.

**Answer:** \boxed{294}
