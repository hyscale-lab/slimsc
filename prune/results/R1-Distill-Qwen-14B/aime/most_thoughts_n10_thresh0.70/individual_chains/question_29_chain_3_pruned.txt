Alright, so I have this geometry problem here, and I need to figure out the length of CE. Let me try to visualize the problem first.

We have two rectangles, ABCD and EFGH. The points D, E, C, F are collinear. That means they all lie on a straight line. Also, the points A, D, H, G all lie on a circle. Hmm, that's interesting. So those four points are concyclic or lie on the same circumference.

Given lengths: BC = 16, AB = 107, FG = 17, and EF = 184. We need to find CE.

First, let me sketch this out mentally. Let's consider rectangle ABCD. Since it's a rectangle, all angles are right angles, and opposite sides are equal. So, AB is 107, which is the length, and BC is 16, which is the width. Therefore, CD is also 107, and AD is 16.

Similarly, rectangle EFGH has sides EF = 184 and FG = 17. So, EF is the length, and FG is the width. Therefore, GH is 184, and FG is 17, so HG is 184 as well.

Now, the rectangles are placed such that points D, E, C, F are collinear. So, I imagine that the two rectangles are connected along this line. Let me try to figure out the positions of these points.

Let me label the points: ABCD is a rectangle, so the points go in order A, B, C, D, right? So, if I imagine it on a coordinate plane, maybe A is at the origin (0,0), so B would be at (107,0), C at (107,16), and D at (0,16). But that's just one possible arrangement; the exact coordinates might not matter, but perhaps the relative positions.

Wait, but the problem doesn't specify the orientation, so I might have to figure that out. Alternatively, perhaps the rectangles are placed in a way that their sides are aligned. Hmm.

Since D, E, C, F are collinear, let's think about how E and F can be placed with respect to D and C.

Wait, in rectangle ABCD, the points are A, B, C, D. So, D is connected to C and A. In rectangle EFGH, the points are E, F, G, H. So, E is connected to F and H.

Given that D, E, C, F are collinear, so E is somewhere on the line that connects D and C, and F is somewhere else on that same line. Wait, but in the rectangle EFGH, F is connected to E and G. So, perhaps E is between D and C, and F is beyond C? Or maybe E is beyond D and F is between D and C.

Wait, I think I need to get a better handle on this. Let me try to assign coordinates to figure this out.

Let's suppose rectangle ABCD is placed with point D at (0,16), C at (107
