Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the number of triples of nonnegative integers (a, b, c) such that a + b + c = 300 and a²b + a²c + b²a + b²c + c²a + c²b = 6,000,000. Hmm, that looks a bit complicated, but let me break it down.

First, I know that a, b, and c are nonnegative integers, so they can be zero or any positive integer. The first equation is straightforward, it's just the sum of the three variables. The second equation is a bit more complex; it's a combination of products of squares and linear terms.

I remember that sometimes when dealing with symmetric equations like this, it's helpful to factor or find symmetric expressions. Let me look at the second equation again: a²b + a²c + b²a + b²c + c²a + c²b. I notice that each term is a product of two variables where one is squared. Let me try to factor this expression.

Wait, maybe I can factor it as ab(a + b) + bc(b + c) + ca(c + a). Let me check that:

ab(a + b) = a²b + ab²
bc(b + c) = b²c + bc²
ca(c + a) = c²a + ca²

Yes, that's exactly the same as the original expression. So, the second equation can be rewritten as:

ab(a + b) + bc(b + c) + ca(c + a) = 6,000,000.

Hmm, maybe I can factor this further or find a way to relate it to the first equation. Since a + b + c = 300, perhaps I can express some parts in terms of this sum.

Let me think. If a + b + c = 300, then a + b = 300 - c, and similarly for the others. Maybe substituting that in will help.

So, replacing a + b with (300 - c), the expression becomes:

ab(300 - c) + bc(300 - a) + ca(300 - b) = 6,000,000.

Let me expand each term:

ab * 300 - ab * c + bc * 300 - bc * a + ca * 300 - ca * b.

So, expanding term by term:

300ab - abc + 300bc - abc + 300ca - abc.

Combine like terms:

300(ab + bc + ca) - 3abc.

So, the equation is 300(ab + bc + ca) - 3abc = 6,000,000.

Hmm, that's a bit simpler. Let me write that:

300(ab + bc + ca) - 3abc = 6,000,000.

I can factor out a 3 from both terms on the left:

3[100(ab + bc + ca) - abc] = 6,000,000.

Divide both sides by 3:

100(ab + bc + ca) - abc = 2,000,000.

So, now I have:

100(ab + bc + ca) - abc = 2,000,000.

Hmm, this is a simpler equation. Let me denote S = a + b + c = 300, P = abc, and Q = ab + bc + ca. Then the equation becomes:

100Q - P = 2,000,000.

But I also know that for three variables, the relationship between S, Q, and another variable R (which is a² + b² + c²) is given by S² = Q + 2R. Wait, but maybe that's not directly helpful here.

Alternatively, I know that for variables a, b, c, their elementary symmetric sums are S = a + b + c, Q = ab + bc + ca, and P = abc. So, perhaps I can express the equation in terms of these symmetric sums.

So, I have 100Q - P = 2,000,000.

I also know that S = 300, so if I can find Q in terms of S and maybe other variables, perhaps I can substitute. But I'm not sure yet.

Let me think about possible substitutions or other equations that involve Q and P. Maybe I can express Q in terms of S and another variable.

Wait, another thought: if I can find Q, then I can solve for P, since 100Q - P = 2,000,000 => P = 100Q - 2,000,000.

Hmm, but how can I find Q? Maybe using the equation S = 300, so S² = 90,000.

And S² = a² + b² + c² + 2(ab + bc + ca) => 90,000 = R + 2Q, where R is a² + b² + c².

But I don't know R, so that might not help directly. Unless I can bound Q, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, I can think about the symmetric sums. Maybe I can consider that a, b, c are the roots of a cubic equation. Let me see.

If a, b, c are roots of x³ - Sx² + Qx - P = 0, then yes, that's correct. But I'm not sure if that helps me find possible integer triples.

Wait, another approach: Maybe I can factor the equation 100Q - P = 2,000,000 as P = 100Q - 2,000,000. So, P = 100Q - 2,000,000.

Now, since a, b, c are nonnegative integers, P = abc must also be a nonnegative integer, and Q = ab + bc + ca is also a nonnegative integer.

So, substituting P into the equation, we have P = 100Q - 2,000,000. So, 100Q must be greater than or equal to 2,000,000, which implies that Q ≥ 20,000.

Wait, because if 100Q - 2,000,000 ≥ 0, then Q ≥ 20,000.

Hmm, but I also know that for nonnegative integers a, b, c, the maximum possible Q is when two variables are as large as possible and the third is zero. For example, suppose c = 0, then a + b = 300, and Q = ab + 0 + 0 = ab. The maximum value of ab when a
