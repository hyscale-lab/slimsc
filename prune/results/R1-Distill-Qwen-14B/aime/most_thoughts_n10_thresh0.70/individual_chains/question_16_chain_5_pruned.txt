Okay, so I'm trying to solve this math problem where I need to find the least prime number p such that there's a positive integer n where n⁴ + 1 is divisible by p². Then, I have to find the smallest m where m⁴ +1 is divisible by p². Hmm, let's break this down step by step.

First, I remember that for a prime p, if p divides n⁴ +1, then n⁴ ≡ -1 mod p. That means that the order of n modulo p divides 8 because (n⁴)² ≡ 1 mod p. So the multiplicative order of n modulo p is 8. But for the order to be 8, 8 must divide p-1 because the multiplicative group modulo p is cyclic with order p-1. So p must be congruent to 1 mod 8. That gives me an initial thought—maybe primes like 17, 97, etc., which are 1 mod 8.

But wait, the problem is about p² dividing n⁴ +1, not just p. So I need primes where n⁴ ≡ -1 mod p² for some n. That's a higher power, so maybe I need to check primes beyond just the ones where p ≡1 mod 8.

I think I should start by checking small primes and see if any satisfy the condition that p² divides n⁴ +1 for some n. Let's list some small primes and see:

Start with p=2: Let's check if 2²=4 divides n⁴ +1. Let's try n=1: 1+1=2. 2 isn't divisible by 4. n=2: 16+1=17, which is 1 mod 4, so also not divisible by 4. n=3: 81+1=82, which is 2 mod 4. So no luck. So p=2 doesn't work.

Next, p=5: Because 5 is 1 mod 4, and maybe it's a candidate. Let's see if 5²=25 divides n⁴ +1 for some n. Let's compute n⁴ mod 25 for n from 1 to 12 (since 25 is 5², and after that, it repeats).

n=1: 1+1=2 mod25 → no
n=2: 16+1=17 mod25 → no
n=3: 81+1=82 → 82-3*25=82-75=7 → 7 mod25 → no
n=4: 256+1=257 → 257-10*25=257-250=7 → 7 mod25 → nope
n=5: 625+1=626 → 626 mod25. 25*25=625, so 626 ≡1 mod25. Not 0.
n=6: 6⁴=1296. 1296 mod25: 25*51=1275. 1296-1275=21 → 21+1=22 mod25. Not 0.
n=7: 7⁴=2401. 2401 mod25: 25*96=2400 → 2401 ≡1 → 1+1=2 mod25. No.
n=8: 8⁴=4096. 4096 mod25: 25*163=4075. 4096-4075=21 → 21+1=22 mod25. Not 0.
n=9: 9⁴=6561 mod25. 25*262=6550. 6561-6550=11 → 11+1=12 mod25. No.
n=10: 10⁴=10000 mod25 is 0. 0+1=1 mod25. No.
n=11: 11⁴=14641. Let's compute 14641 /25: 25*585=14625. 14641-14625=16 → 16+1=17 mod25. No.
n=12: 12⁴=20736. 20736 mod25: 25*829=20725. 20736-20725=11 → 11+1=12 mod25. No.

Hmm, none of these n from 1 to 12 give n⁴ +1 ≡0 mod25. Maybe 5 doesn't work. Let's try next prime.

p=13: 13²=169. Let's see if any n<13 has n⁴ ≡-1 mod169.

But this seems tedious. Maybe I can use a smarter approach. I remember that if p is a prime where n⁴ ≡ -1 mod p, then to have n⁴ ≡-1 mod p², certain conditions must hold. Specifically, Hensel's lemma might be applicable here. But I might not remember all the details, so let me think.

First, for a prime p, suppose that n⁴ ≡ -1 mod p. Then, to lift this solution to mod p², we can use the derivative. Let f(n) = n⁴ +1. Then f'(n)=4n³. For Hensel's lemma, if f(n) ≡0 mod p and f'(n) not ≡0 mod p, then there is a unique lift of the root mod p². So if p≠2, f'(n) =4n³. So as long as n is not ≡0 mod p, then 4n³ ≡ something not 0 mod p, so the root can be lifted uniquely.

Wait, but for p=2, things are different. Let's come back to that later.

So for p=5, let's see. Suppose there exists n with n⁴ ≡-1 mod5. Let's check n=2: 16 mod5 is 1. n=3: 81 mod5 is 1. n=1: 1 mod5. n=4: 256 mod5 is 1. Wait, n=2: 2⁴=16≡1 mod5. So 1≡-1 mod5? No, because 1≡-1 mod5 would mean 2≡0 mod5, which is false. So n⁴ ≡-1 mod5 is not possible? Wait, is that right
