Okay, so I have this math problem here. It says to define two functions, f(x) and g(x), and then find the number of intersections between two graphs. The functions are given as:

f(x) = ||x| - 1/2| and g(x) = ||x| - 1/4|.

The graphs are y = 4 g(f(sin(2πx))) and x = 4 g(f(cos(3πy))). I need to find how many times these two graphs intersect.

Hmm. Alright, let's break this down step by step.

First, I think I should understand what f(x) and g(x) look like. Since both are absolute value functions, they likely have some V-shape or diamond shapes.

Starting with f(x) = ||x| - 1/2|. Let's consider x values. The inner part is |x|, which is a V-shape with the vertex at (0,0). Then subtracting 1/2 gives |x| - 1/2, which shifts the graph down by 1/2. So the vertex moves to (0, -1/2). But since we take the absolute value again, any negative part becomes positive. So where was |x| - 1/2 negative? It's negative when |x| < 1/2. So in that region, the function becomes -( |x| - 1/2 ) = 1/2 - |x|. So f(x) is a V-shape that goes up on both sides from x = -1/2 and x = 1/2, meeting at the top at (0, 1/2). So it's like a diamond shape between x = -1/2 and x = 1/2, going up to 1/2, and outside that, it's the same as |x| - 1/2, which is V-shaped with vertices at (1/2, 0) and (-1/2, 0).

Similarly, g(x) = ||x| - 1/4|. Let's analyze this. Again, start with |x|, shift down by 1/4, so the vertex is at (0, -1/4). Then take the absolute value, so where |x| - 1/4 is negative, which is when |x| < 1/4, it becomes 1/4 - |x|. So g(x) is a diamond shape between x = -1/4 and x = 1/4, reaching up to 1/4 at x=0, and outside that, it's |x| - 1/4, which is V-shaped with vertices at (1/4, 0) and (-1/4, 0).

Okay, so now I have f(x) and g(x) defined. Next, I need to consider the compositions of these functions with sine and cosine.

The first function is y = 4 g(f(sin(2πx))). Let's parse this. So starting with sin(2πx), then apply f, then g, and multiply by 4.

Similarly, the second equation is x = 4 g(f(cos(3πy))). So starting with cos(3πy), apply f, then g, multiply by 4, and set equal to x.

So the problem reduces to finding the number of points (x,y) that satisfy both equations.

Wait, but the first equation is y = some function of x, and the second is x = some function of y. So it's like a system of equations. To find intersections, I need to find (x,y) such that:

y = 4 g(f(sin(2πx)))  
x = 4 g(f(cos(3πy)))

So each equation relates x and y through a transformation involving f and g.

This seems complicated, but maybe I can analyze the behavior of these functions and find how many solutions exist.

First, perhaps I should understand the range of 4 g(f(z)) for z in [-1,1], since sin and cos functions output values between -1 and 1.

Wait, actually, since f(x) is applied to sin(2πx), and then g is applied to that. So let's consider the range of sin(2πx). It's between -1 and 1, just like cos(3πy).

Then f(z) for z in [-1,1] would be ||z| - 1/2|. Let's find the range of f(z).

When z is between -1 and 1, |z| is between 0 and 1. So |z| - 1/2 is between -1/2 and 1/2. Taking absolute value again, f(z) is between 0 and 1/2. Specifically:

- For |z| ≥ 1/2, f(z) = |z| - 1/2, which ranges from 0 to 1/2.
- For |z| < 1/2, f(z) = 1/2 - |z|, which ranges from 0 to 1/2.

So f(z) has a range of [0, 1/2].

Then g is applied to f(z). So g(w) where w is in [0, 1/2]. Let's find the range of g(w) for w in [0, 1/2].

g(w) = ||w| - 1/4|. Since w is non-negative, this becomes |w - 1/4|.

So when w is between 0 and 1/4, |w - 1/4| = 1/4 - w, which ranges from 1/4 to 0.

When w is between 1/4 and 1/2, |w - 1/4| = w - 1/4, which ranges from 0 to 1/4.

So the range of g(w) is [0, 1/4]. Therefore, 4 g(w) ranges from 0 to 1.

So 4 g(f(z)) is a function that takes z in [-1,1] and outputs a value between 0 and 1.

Therefore, both y and x in the equations are confined between 0 and 1.

So now, the first equation is y = 4 g(f(sin(2πx))), and the second is x = 4 g(f(cos(3πy))).

Since both x and y are between 0 and 1, perhaps I can model this as a function from [0,1]x[0,1] to find intersections.

But maybe a better approach is to analyze the functions' behavior and see how many times they intersect.

Alternatively, perhaps I can represent both equations as functions y = h(x) and x = k(y), and find the number of intersections between y = h(x) and x = k(y). But since h and k are both functions from [0,1] to [0,1], this might involve some periodicity.

Wait, but h(x) is periodic with period 1, because sin(2πx) has period 1. Similarly, k(y) is based on cos(3πy), which has period 2/3. So h(x) is periodic with period 1, and k(y) is periodic with period 2/3.

Hmm, that complicates things a bit. So the functions are periodic, which might lead to multiple intersections over each period.

Alternatively, perhaps I can consider the number of solutions in a fundamental period.

But let me think step by step.

First, let me analyze the function h(x) = 4 g(f(sin(2πx))). Let's try to understand how h(x) behaves.

Since sin(2πx) has a period of 1, h(x) will also have a period of 1.

Similarly, k(y) = 4 g(f(cos(3πy))) has a period of 2/3, since cos(3πy) has period 2/3.

So the functions h(x) and k(y) repeat every 1 unit and 2/3 units, respectively.

But since we're looking for intersections of y = h(x) and x = k(y), perhaps it's better to look within the square [0,1]x[0,1], as beyond that, the functions repeat.

Wait, but if x and y are in [0,1], and the functions are periodic, then the entire graph is just a tiling of the fundamental square.

So perhaps the number of intersections within [0,1]x[0,1] will be the same as in any other square, so we can just compute the number within [0,1]x[0,1] and that would be the total number.

But how do I count the number of intersections?

It's tricky because both h(x) and k(y) are functions, so their graphs are curves in the plane. The intersections would be the points where h(x) = y and k(y) = x. So substituting, we get h(x) = y and x = k(h(x)).

So substituting, we have x = k(h(x)).

So the problem reduces to finding the number of solutions to the equation x = k(h(x)).

Similarly, since h(x) is periodic with period 1, and k(y) is periodic with period 2/3, the composite function k(h(x)) may have a period that is the least common multiple of 1 and 2/3, which is 2.

Wait, but perhaps I should not get ahead of myself.

Let me consider x in [0,1], then h(x) is in [0,1], and k(h(x)) is 4 g(f(cos(3π h(x)))). So the equation is x = 4 g(f(cos(3π h(x)))).

Given that h(x) is 4 g(f(sin(2πx))), this is getting quite nested.

Alternatively, perhaps I can model h(x) and k(y) numerically or graphically, but since I can't plot them here, I need another approach.

Alternatively, perhaps I can consider the possible values that h(x) can take and see how they map through k.

But this seems complicated. Maybe another approach is to consider the number of times y = h(x) crosses x = k(y). Since h(x) and k(y) are both functions from [0,1] to [0,1], their graphs are in the square [0,1]x[0,1].

The number of intersections would be the number of times the graph of y = h(x) crosses the graph of x = k(y). But since x = k(y) is the same as y = k^{-1}(x), assuming k is invertible. But k is not necessarily invertible everywhere, so it's not straightforward.

Alternatively, perhaps I can consider the intersections as solutions to y = h(x) and x = k(y). So substituting y from the first equation into the second, we get x = k(h(x)).

So the number of solutions to this equation x = k(h(x)) will give the number of intersection points.

So let me define the function m(x) = k(h(x)) - x, and find how many times m(x) crosses zero in [0,1].

Each crossing corresponds to an intersection point.

To find the number of zeros of m(x), I can analyze the behavior of m(x). If I can find how many times m(x) changes sign, each sign change indicates a root.

But to do this, I need to understand how m(x) behaves. Let's try to find m(0), m(1), and see if it's increasing or decreasing.

Wait, but first, let me think about h(x) and k(y).

h(x) = 4 g(f(sin(2πx))).

We know that f(z) = ||z| - 1/2|. So for sin(2πx), which is between -1 and 1, so |sin(2πx)| is between 0 and 1.

Then f(sin(2πx)) = | |sin(2πx)| - 1/2 |. Let me denote s = sin(2πx). Then f(s) = | |s| - 1/2 |.

Similarly, g(f(s)) = | f(s) - 1/4 |.

So h(x) = 4 * | | |sin(2πx)| - 1/2 | - 1/4 |.

Similarly, k(y) = 4 g(f(cos(3πy))).

Let me denote c = cos(3πy). Then f(c) = | |c| -1/2 |, then g(f(c)) = | f(c) - 1/4 |, and k(y) = 4 * g(f(c)).

So, h(x) and k(y) are both functions that involve multiple absolute value operations and trigonometric functions.

This seems complicated, but perhaps I can analyze their behavior over intervals.

Alternatively, perhaps I can consider the periods of the functions.

Given that h(x) has a period of 1, and k(y) has a period of 2/3, the composite function m(x) = k(h(x)) will have a period equal to the least common multiple of 1 and 2/3, which is 2. So m(x) has period 2.

But since we're only considering x in [0,1], perhaps the behavior in [0,1] will repeat in [1,2], but since we're confined to [0,1] for x and y, maybe I can just focus on that interval.

But I'm getting a bit stuck here. Maybe I can analyze h(x) and k(y) more carefully.

Let's consider h(x) first.

h
