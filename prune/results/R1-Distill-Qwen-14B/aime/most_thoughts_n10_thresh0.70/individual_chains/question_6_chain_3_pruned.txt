Okay, so I have this problem here where I need to find the number of intersections between two graphs. The equations are y = 4 g(f(sin(2πx))) and x = 4 g(f(cos(3πy))). Hmm, that looks a bit complicated, but let me try to break it down.

First, I should understand what the functions f and g are. The problem defines f(x) as ||x| - 1/2|. Wait, that's the absolute value of |x| minus 1/2, all inside another absolute value. Similarly, g(x) is ||x| - 1/4|. So, both f and g are functions that take the absolute value of x, subtract a fraction, and then take the absolute value again. Interesting.

Let me write out f(x) and g(x) more clearly:

f(x) = ||x| - 1/2|
g(x) = ||x| - 1/4|

So, both functions are transformations of the absolute value function. I remember that absolute value functions create V-shaped graphs, and applying another absolute value after a shift can create multiple segments or change the graph's symmetry.

To understand f and g better, maybe I should sketch their graphs or find key points.

Starting with f(x) = ||x| - 1/2|.

The inner part is |x| - 1/2. So, |x| is a V-shape with vertex at (0,0). Subtracting 1/2 shifts the graph down by 1/2. Then taking the absolute value of that would reflect any negative parts back up.

Let me find the critical points for f(x):

1. When is |x| - 1/2 equal to zero? That's when |x| = 1/2, so x = 1/2 and x = -1/2.
2. Between x = -1/2 and x = 1/2, |x| - 1/2 is negative, so ||x| - 1/2| = -( |x| - 1/2 ) = 1/2 - |x|.
3. Outside of that interval, |x| >= 1/2, so ||x| - 1/2| = |x| - 1/2.

So, the graph of f(x) is a V-shape that has a peak at x = 0, y = 1/2, and slopes downward to y = 0 at x = ±1/2, then continues as upward V-shapes beyond that.

Similarly, for g(x) = ||x| - 1/4|:

1. The inner part |x| - 1/4 is zero when |x| = 1/4, so x = ±1/4.
2. Between x = -1/4 and x = 1/4, |x| - 1/4 is negative, so g(x) becomes 1/4 - |x|.
3. Outside of that interval, g(x) = |x| - 1/4.

So, the graph of g(x) has a peak at x=0, y=1/4, then slopes down to zero at x=±1/4, then continues upward beyond that.

Got it. Now, both f and g are applied inside each other and then scaled by 4.

Wait, the functions inside the main equations are 4 g(f(...)).

Let me first figure out what f(sin(2πx)) and g(f(...)) would look like.

But wait, let's first think about the composition of functions.

Given that f(x) = ||x| - 1/2|, and g(x) = ||x| - 1/4|, so 4g(f(x)) would be 4 times the function g applied to f(x).

So, let's compute 4g(f(x)):

g(f(x)) = ||f(x)| - 1/4|.

But since f(x) is always non-negative (because it's an absolute value function), so |f(x)| is just f(x). Therefore, g(f(x)) = |f(x) - 1/4|.

So, 4g(f(x)) = 4 |f(x) - 1/4|.

Hmm, that's helpful.

Now, f(x) is ||x| - 1/2|. So, f(x) can be written as:

f(x) = | |x| - 1/2 |.

Which, as I thought earlier, has a peak at 1/2 when x=0, and goes down to 0 at x=±1/2, then up again.

So, g(f(x)) is |f(x) - 1/4|.

Let me analyze this function.

Since f(x) can be 0, 1/2, and up.

So, when f(x) >= 1/4, |f(x) - 1/4| = f(x) - 1/4.

When f(x) < 1/4, |f(x) - 1/4| = 1/4 - f(x).

So, 4g(f(x)) = 4*(f(x) - 1/4) when f(x) >= 1/4, and 4*(1/4 - f(x)) when f(x) < 1/4.

Simplify:

4g(f(x)) = 4f(x) - 1 when f(x) >= 1/4,

and 1 - 4f(x) when f(x) < 1/4.

But since f(x) can be written as | |x| - 1/2 |, which is always non-negative, and ranges from 0 to 1/2.

So, when f(x) is between 0 and 1/4, 4g(f(x)) = 1 - 4f(x).

When f(x) is between 1/4 and 1/2, 4g(f(x)) = 4f(x) -1.

Wait, but 4*(1/4 - f(x)) is 1 -4f(x), which when f(x) is 0, gives 1, and when f(x) is 1/4, gives 0.

Similarly, when f(x) is 1/2, 4*(1/2 -1/4)=4*(1/4)=
