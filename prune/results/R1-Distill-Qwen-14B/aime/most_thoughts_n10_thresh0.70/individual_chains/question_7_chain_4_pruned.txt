Okay, so I have this problem about coloring the vertices of a regular octagon either red or blue, each with equal probability. The question is about finding the probability that after coloring, there exists a rotation of the octagon such that all the blue vertices end up where the red vertices were originally, and vice versa. The answer needs to be in the form of a fraction m/n where m and n are coprime, and then find m + n.

Hmm, let me break this down. First, the octagon has 8 vertices, each of which is colored red or blue independently with a 50-50 chance. So, the total number of possible colorings is 2^8 = 256.

Now, we need to find the number of colorings where there's a rotation that swaps all the blue vertices to the positions where there were originally red ones. That is, after some rotation, every blue vertex is now where a red was before, and similarly, every red is now where a blue was.

Wait, so essentially, the coloring must be such that the set of blue vertices is a rotation of the set of red vertices. Or, in other words, the blue vertices are a translate (rotationally shifted) version of the red vertices.

This feels like it's related to group theory and maybe Burnside's lemma? Or perhaps something about necklace colorings. Let me think.

Wait, Burnside's lemma deals with counting orbits under group actions, which might be useful here. The group in question is the cyclic group C8, since we can rotate the octagon in steps of 45 degrees (which is 360/8). The group has 8 elements: rotations by 0째, 45째, 90째, ..., 315째.

But how does this help? Well, perhaps I need to count the number of colorings fixed by some rotation, but I'm not sure yet.

Wait, the problem isn't exactly about fixed colorings, but about colorings where there exists a rotation that swaps the colors. So maybe it's about colorings where the coloring is symmetric under some rotation, but with colors swapped.

Alternatively, perhaps the coloring has a rotational symmetry where applying that rotation changes red to blue and vice versa. So, in group theory terms, the coloring is fixed under an element of the group composed with the color inversion.

Wait, that might be the case. So, if we think of the color
