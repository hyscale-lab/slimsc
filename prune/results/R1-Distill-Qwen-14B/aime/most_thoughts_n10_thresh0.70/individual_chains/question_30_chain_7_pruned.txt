Okay, so I have this math problem to solve, and it's a bit tricky for me, but I'll try to think it through step by step. The problem says:

Let ω ≠ 1 be a 13th root of unity. Find the remainder when 
\[ \prod_{k=0}^{12}(2 - 2\omega^k + \omega^{2k}) \] 
is divided by 1000.

Hmm, okay. I remember that roots of unity have some nice properties, especially when it comes to polynomials. Maybe I can use those properties to simplify this product.

First, let me understand what ω is. Since ω is a 13th root of unity, it satisfies the equation ω^13 = 1. Also, ω ≠ 1, so it's a primitive 13th root of unity. That means ω^k for k from 1 to 12 are all distinct roots, and ω^13 = 1.

The product is over k from 0 to 12, so each term in the product is 2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k}. Hmm, maybe I can rewrite this expression to make it more manageable.

Let me factor out a 2 from the first two terms: 2(1 - ω^k) + ω^{2k}. Hmm, not sure if that helps. Alternatively, perhaps I can rearrange the terms:

2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k} = ω^{2k} - 2ω^k + 2.

Wait a second, that looks like a quadratic in terms of ω^k. Maybe I can think of it as a quadratic equation. Let me set x = ω^k, so the term becomes x² - 2x + 2. So each term in the product is x² - 2x + 2, where x = ω^k.

So, the entire product becomes the product over k=0 to 12 of (x² - 2x + 2), where x = ω^k.

But wait, when k=0, x = ω^0 = 1. So that term becomes 1² - 2*1 + 2 = 1 - 2 + 2 = 1. So when k=0, the term is 1, which doesn't affect the product.

So, I can actually write the product as the product from k=1 to 12 of (x² - 2x + 2), since the k=0 term is 1 and multiplying by 1 doesn't change the product.

So, the problem simplifies to computing the product for k=1 to 12 of (ω^{2k} - 2ω^k + 2).

Now, I need to compute this product. Since ω is a primitive 13th root of unity, perhaps I can relate this product to polynomials evaluated at certain points.

I recall that for a polynomial P(x), the product over roots can be expressed as P(x) evaluated at certain points. Maybe I can construct a polynomial whose roots are related to ω^k.

Wait, each term is of the form x² - 2x + 2 where x = ω^k. So, the product from k=1 to 12 is the product of (ω^{2k} - 2ω^k + 2). Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe I can consider the polynomial whose roots are ω^k. The minimal polynomial for ω over the rationals is the 13th cyclotomic polynomial, which is Φ_13(x) = x^12 + x^11 + ... + x + 1.

But I'm not sure if that's directly applicable here. Let me think differently.

Each term in the product is a quadratic in ω^k. Maybe I can think of the product as the product over k=1 to 12 of (
