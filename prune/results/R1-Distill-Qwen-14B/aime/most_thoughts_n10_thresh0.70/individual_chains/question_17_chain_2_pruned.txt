Okay, so I've got this math problem here about rectangular boxes with a given surface area and volume, and I need to find the radius of the smallest sphere that can contain any of these boxes. Then, I have to express r squared as a fraction p over q, where p and q are coprime, and find p + q. Hmm, that sounds a bit involved, but let's break it down.

First, let me parse the problem statement again. We have a set B of rectangular boxes. Each box has a surface area of 54 and a volume of 23. We need to find the radius r of the smallest sphere that can contain each of these boxes. The sphere's radius squared, r², will be a fraction p/q, and we have to find p + q after simplifying it.

So, the key things here are: the boxes are rectangular, so they have length, width, and height, let's say a, b, c. The surface area is given by 2(ab + bc + ac) = 54. The volume is given by abc = 23. We need to find the minimal enclosing sphere for any such box, which would have a radius equal to half the space diagonal of the box. So, the space diagonal of the box is sqrt(a² + b² + c²), and the radius r would be half of that, so r = sqrt(a² + b² + c²)/2. Therefore, r² = (a² + b² + c²)/4.

So, our goal is to minimize r², which is equivalent to minimizing a² + b² + c², given the constraints on surface area and volume.

Alright, so we have two constraints:

1. 2(ab + bc + ac) = 54
2. abc = 23

We need to minimize a² + b² + c².

This seems like a problem of optimization with constraints. I've heard of using Lagrange multipliers for such problems, but I'm not super confident with that. Alternatively, maybe I can express some variables in terms of others and find a function to minimize.

Alternatively, perhaps using some inequalities, like AM ≥ GM or Cauchy-Schwarz, but I'm not sure how directly applicable those are here.

Let me write down the given:

Surface area: 2(ab + bc + ac) = 54 ⇒ ab + bc + ac = 27

Volume: abc = 23

We can think of a, b, c as positive real numbers.

We need to minimize a² + b² + c².

I recall that for positive numbers, (a + b + c)² = a² + b² + c² + 2(ab + bc + ac). Since we know ab + bc + ac is 27, perhaps this can help.

Let me denote S = a + b + c, Q = a² + b² + c². Then,

S² = Q + 2(ab + bc + ac) ⇒ S² = Q + 54.

So, Q = S² - 54.

Our goal is to minimize Q, which is the same as minimizing S², since 54 is a constant. Therefore, if we can find the minimum value of S, then we can get Q.

Wait, so if we can find the minimal possible S, then Q will be minimal as well, which would give us the minimal r².

So, now the problem reduces to minimizing S = a + b + c, given ab + bc + ac = 27 and abc = 23.

Hmm, that seems a bit more manageable. Let me think about how to find the minimal S.

I remember that for fixed ab + bc + ac and abc, the minimal S occurs when the variables are as equal as possible. Since if the variables are unequal, you can rearrange them to be more equal and get a smaller sum.

Wait, is that always the case? Maybe. Alternatively, perhaps we can use the method of Lagrange multipliers.

Let me set up the optimization problem formally.

We need to minimize S = a + b + c,

with constraints:

1. ab + bc + ac = 27

2. abc = 23

We can use Lagrange multipliers for multiple constraints. The Lagrangian would be:

L = a + b + c + λ(27 - ab - bc - ac) + μ(23 - abc)

Wait, no, actually, the constraints are ab + bc + ac = 27 and abc = 23. So, we set up the Lagrangian as:

L = a + b + c + λ(27 - (ab + bc + ac)) + μ(23 - abc)

Then,
