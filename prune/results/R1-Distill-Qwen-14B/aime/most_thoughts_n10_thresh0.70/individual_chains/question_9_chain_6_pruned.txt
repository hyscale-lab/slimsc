Okay, so I have this problem here: there exist real numbers x and y, both greater than 1, such that log base x of y^x equals 10, and log base y of x^{4y} also equals 10. I need to find the product xy.

Hmm, let me start by writing down what I know. The problem gives two logarithmic equations:

1. log_x(y^x) = 10
2. log_y(x^{4y}) = 10

I remember that logarithms have some properties that might help here. For the first equation, log_x(y^x), I can use the power rule which says log_b(a^k) = k*log_b(a). So applying that, the first equation becomes:

x * log_x(y) = 10

Similarly, for the second equation, log_y(x^{4y}), applying the same power rule gives:

4y * log_y(x) = 10

Wait, I also remember that log_b(a) is equal to 1 / log_a(b). So log_x(y) is equal to 1 / log_y(x). Maybe I can use that to set up some variables or equations.

Let me denote log_x(y) as A. Then, log_y(x) would be 1/A because of the reciprocal property.

So substituting into the first equation: x * A = 10. So A = 10 / x.

Then, the second equation: 4y * (1/A) = 10. Because log_y(x) is 1/A.

But since A is 10/x, substituting that in, I get 4y * (x/10) = 10. Because 1/A is x/10.

So let's write that equation:

(4y * x) / 10 = 10

Simplify that, multiply both sides by 10:

4y * x = 100

So 4xy = 100, which simplifies to xy = 25.

Wait, is that it? Did I find xy directly?

But let me double-check because sometimes with logarithms, things can get tricky.

First equation: log_x(y^x) = 10. Which becomes x * log_x(y) =10.

Second equation: log_y(x^{4y})=10, which is 4y * log_y(x) =10.

Since log_x(y) = 1 / log_y(x), let me express both equations in terms of log_x(y).

Let me let A = log_x(y). Then, log_y(x) = 1/A.

So first equation becomes x * A =10.

Second equation becomes 4y * (1/A) =10.

So from first equation, A = 10/x.

Substitute into second equation:

4y * (x/10) = 10.

Multiply both sides by 10:

4y * x = 100.

Divide both sides by 4:

xy = 25.

Hmm, that seems consistent. So xy is 25. But wait, let me see if that makes sense with the original equations.

If xy=25, then we can find x and y in terms of each other. Let me assume x=25/y.

But I need to check if there are real numbers x and y greater than 1 that satisfy both logarithmic equations.

Let me try to find x and y. From the first equation:

x * log_x(y) =10.

But log_x(y) is ln(y)/ln(x). So:

x * (ln y / ln x) =10.

Similarly, from the second equation:

4y * (ln x / ln y) =10.

Wait, so let me write both:

1. x * (ln y / ln x) =10.

2. 4y * (ln x / ln y
