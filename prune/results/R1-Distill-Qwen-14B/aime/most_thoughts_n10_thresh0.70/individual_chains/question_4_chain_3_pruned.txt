Okay, so I have this problem where Alice and Bob are playing a game with a stack of n tokens. They take turns removing either 1 or 4 tokens, and the person who takes the last token wins. I need to find how many positive integers n â‰¤ 2024 make Bob the winner if he plays optimally, regardless of Alice's moves.

Hmm, let's think about this. So Alice goes first, and they alternate turns. The key is to figure out for which values of n Bob can force a win. I remember that in such games, positions are often classified as winning or losing positions. A winning position is one where the current player can force a win, and a losing position is where no matter what the current player does, the opponent can force a win.

So, let's try to model the game for small n and see if a pattern emerges.

For n=1: Alice takes the last token and wins. So Bob can't win here. So n=1 is a winning position for Alice.

n=2: Alice can take 1 token, leaving 1 for Bob. Then Bob takes the last one and wins. Wait, no, wait. Wait, let me think. If Alice takes 1 token, then Bob is left with 1 token. Bob takes it and wins. So Alice doesn't want to do that. Alternatively, Alice could take 4 tokens, but that's not possible because n=2. So Alice can only take 1 token, and then Bob takes the last one. So for n=2, Bob can win. So n=2 is a losing position for Alice, meaning it's a winning position for Bob.

Wait, maybe I got that wrong. Let me clarify. If n=2 is the starting position. Alice's options: she can take 1, leaving 1 for Bob. Bob can then take that 1 and win. So for n=2, Bob can win. So n=2 is a losing position for Alice, which is a winning position for Bob.

n=3: Alice can take 1, leaving 2 for Bob. From n=2, we know Bob can win. So if Alice takes 1, Bob can win. Alternatively, can Alice take 4? No, because n=3. So Alice is forced to take 1. So in that case, Bob can win. So n=3 is a losing position for Alice, meaning Bob can win.

Wait
