Okay, so I've got this problem where Alice picks a set A of positive integers. Then Bob makes a list of all finite nonempty sets B where the maximum element of B is in A. It says Bob's list has 2024 sets, and I need to find the sum of the elements in A.

Hmm, let's break it down. First, I need to visualize what Bob is doing. He's listing all finite non-empty sets B such that the maximum element of B is in A. So, for each element a in A, Bob can create various sets B where a is the maximum. The number of such sets depends on a, right?

Wait, for each a in A, how many finite non-empty sets B have a as their maximum? Let me think. If a is the maximum, then all other elements of B must be less than a. So, B can contain any combination of elements from 1 to a-1, plus the element a itself. But B has to be non-empty, so for each a, the number of possible sets B is equal to the number of subsets of {1, 2, ..., a-1}, excluding the empty set, and then adding a.

Wait, no. Wait, no. Because if a is the maximum, B must include a, and any combination of elements less than a. So, the number of such sets is 2^{a-1}. Because each element from 1 to a-1 can be either included or not, and a must be included. So for each a, there are 2^{a-1} possible sets B where a is the maximum.

So, if Alice's set A has elements a1, a2, ..., an, then the total number of sets B that Bob can list is the sum over each a in A of 2^{a-1}. Because each element a contributes 2^{a-1} sets.

So, the total number of sets Bob has is the sum_{a in A} 2^{a-1} = 2024.

I need to find a set A such that when I sum 2^{a-1} for each a in A, I get 2024. Then, the sum of the elements of A is what I need to find.

So, the problem reduces to finding a set of positive integers A where the sum of 2^{a-1} for each a in A equals 2024, and then summing all the elements of A.

Wait, let me think about how to represent 2024 as a sum of powers of two. Because 2^{a-1} is a power of two, right? So, if I can represent 2024 as a sum of distinct powers of two, then each term in the sum corresponds to a different a in A.

But wait, 2^{a-1} for a=1 is 1, for a=2 is 2, a=3 is 4, etc. So, each 2^{a-1} is 2^{k} where k = a-1. So, the total sum is the sum of 2^{k} for some k's, and each k is at least 0 because a is at least
