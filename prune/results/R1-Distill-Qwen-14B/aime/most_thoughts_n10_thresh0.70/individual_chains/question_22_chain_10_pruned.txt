Okay, so I have this problem about a convex equilateral hexagon where all pairs of opposite sides are parallel. The hexagon is labeled ABCDEF, and the triangle formed by extending segments AB, CD, and EF has side lengths 200, 240, and 300. I need to find the side length of the hexagon.

Hmm, let me try to visualize this. A convex hexagon, so all its interior angles are less than 180 degrees. It's equilateral, so all sides are equal in length. Also, opposite sides are parallel. That must mean it's a special kind of hexagon, maybe something like a regular hexagon but not necessarily regular because the angles might not all be equal. But wait, in a regular hexagon, all sides and angles are equal and opposite sides are parallel, so this is similar but might not have equal angles.

Wait, but the problem says it's convex and equilateral with opposite sides parallel. So, perhaps it's a type of hexagon called a "parallelogon," but I think in 2D, the only convex parallelogons are parallelograms, but for hexagons, maybe it's a different structure.

Let me think about how the sides relate. Since opposite sides are parallel, the hexagon might be thought of as being built from three pairs of parallel sides. Each pair is opposite each other. So, AB is parallel to DE, BC is parallel to EF, and CD is parallel to FA. Or something like that. Wait, no, the problem says all pairs of opposite sides are parallel. So, in a hexagon, each side has one opposite side. So, for a hexagon labeled ABCDEF, AB is opposite to DE, BC opposite to EF, and CD opposite to FA.

Wait, so AB || DE, BC || EF, and CD || FA. That's interesting.

Now, the triangle formed by extending AB, CD, and EF has sides 200, 240, and 300. So, if I imagine the hexagon, and then extend the sides AB, CD, and EF until they meet to form a triangle, that triangle has these specific side lengths.

I think this triangle is called the "outer triangle" or something similar. Maybe the hexagon is inscribed within this triangle, but I'm not entirely sure. Let's try to draw a rough sketch in
