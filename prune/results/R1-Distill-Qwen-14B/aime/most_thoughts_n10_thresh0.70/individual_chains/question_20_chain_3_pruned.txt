Okay, so I've got this problem about placing chips on a 5x5 grid. There are 25 white chips and 25 black chips, and I can use some of them. Each cell can hold at most one chip. The conditions are that all chips in the same row must be the same color, and the same goes for columns. Also, once I place some chips, I shouldn't be able to add any more without violating these rules. Hmm, interesting.

Let me break this down. Each row and each column must be entirely one color. So, for any given row, it can either be all white, all black, or have no chips at all. Same for columns. Wait, no, columns can't have some chips because if a row is all white, then the columns intersecting that row must also be all white in that column? Or not? Wait, no, because the columns could have a different color elsewhere. Wait, no, each column must have all chips of the same color. So, if a column has any chips, they all must be the same color. Similarly for rows.

So, this is starting to look like a problem where the grid is partitioned into regions of the same color, and each region must be a rectangle that is entirely within a set of rows and columns. But since each row and column can only have one color, the arrangement must be such that each row is either all white, all black, or empty, and similarly for each column.

Wait, but that's a bit stricter. Because if a row is white, then
