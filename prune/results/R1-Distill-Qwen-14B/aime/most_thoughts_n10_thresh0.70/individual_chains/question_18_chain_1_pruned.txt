Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the number of rectangles that can be formed inside a regular dodecagon (12-gon). Each side of the rectangle lies on either a side or a diagonal of the dodecagon. Hmm, interesting. I remember that in regular polygons, especially those with an even number of sides, you can form rectangles by connecting certain vertices, but I need to figure out exactly how many such rectangles exist in a dodecagon.

First, let me recall what a regular dodecagon looks like. It's a 12-sided polygon with all sides equal and all internal angles equal. Each internal angle in a regular dodecagon is 150 degrees. Now, when the problem mentions that each side of the rectangle lies on either a side or a diagonal of the dodecagon, I think this means that the sides of the rectangle are aligned along the edges or the diagonals of the dodecagon.

Since the polygon is regular and has 12 sides, it's symmetric, which should help in counting the rectangles without missing any or counting duplicates. I remember that for a rectangle to be formed inside a regular polygon, it must have its sides aligned with two pairs of parallel sides or diagonals of the polygon.

Let me think about how rectangles are formed. A rectangle is defined by having opposite sides equal and parallel, and all angles being 90 degrees. In a regular dodecagon, the sides and diagonals can be of different lengths depending on how many vertices they skip. For instance, a side skips 0 vertices, a diagonal that connects two vertices with one vertex in between skips 1 vertex, and so on.

Wait, but in a regular polygon, the number of different diagonals depends on the number of sides. For a dodecagon, the diagonals can be of lengths corresponding to skipping 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 vertices, right? Wait, actually, in a regular n-gon, the number of distinct diagonals is (n-3). So, for n=12, that's 9 distinct diagonals. But wait, that might not directly apply here because some diagonals might be the same length when considering the polygon's symmetry.

Wait, actually, in a regular polygon, diagonals can be categorized by how many vertices they skip. For a regular dodecagon, each vertex is connected to 9 other vertices (excluding itself and its two adjacent vertices). But considering the symmetry, diagonals that skip the same number of vertices are congruent. So, the number of distinct diagonal lengths is (n-3)/2 when n is even. Wait, no, actually, for even n, the number of distinct diagonal lengths is n/2 -1. Let me check for n=12: 12/2 -1 =5. So, there are 5 distinct diagonal lengths.

Wait, that might not be correct. Let me think again. Each vertex connects via sides (which are the edges) and diagonals. The diagonals can skip k vertices, where k ranges from 1 to 5, because beyond that, the diagonals start repeating on the other side. For example, skipping 6 vertices would actually be the same as skipping 5 vertices in the opposite direction
