Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the remainder when the product from k=0 to 12 of (2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k}) is divided by 1000. ω is a 13th root of unity, and it's not equal to 1. Hmm, that sounds a bit complex, but let me try to break it down.

First, I remember that roots of unity are solutions to the equation x^n = 1. So, ω^13 = 1, and ω ≠ 1. That means ω is a primitive 13th root of unity.

The expression I have is a product over k from 0 to 12 of (2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k}). That's 13 terms multiplied together. I need to compute this product modulo 1000.

Let me think about each term in the product: 2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k}. Maybe I can factor this or find a pattern. Let's see:

Let me denote z = ω^k. Then each term becomes 2 - 2z + z². So, the product becomes the product over z of (z² - 2z + 2), where z runs over all 13th roots of unity except 1, but wait, when k=0, z=1. So, actually, z does include 1 as one of the terms because when k=0, ω^0 = 1.

So, the product is over z = 1, ω, ω², ..., ω¹² of (z² - 2z + 2). Hmm, I can write this as the product over all 13th roots of unity of (z² - 2z + 2). That might be helpful.

Wait, I recall that for a polynomial, the product of (z - a_i) over all roots a_i is equal to the polynomial evaluated at z. But here, I have a product of (z² - 2z + 2). Let me think about it in terms of polynomials.

Let me define a polynomial P(z) = z² - 2z + 2. Then the product I'm looking for is the product of P(z) as z runs over all 13th roots of unity. So, the product is equal to the product of (z² - 2z + 2) for all z where z^13 = 1.

But I remember that for a polynomial f(z), the product over all roots α of f(α) = 0 of (z - α) is f(z). But here, I'm taking the product of f(z) evaluated at each root of another polynomial. Hmm, perhaps I can relate this to the resultant or something else.

Wait, another approach: If I consider the product over all 13th roots of unity of (z² - 2z + 2), that is equivalent to the product P(z) where z^13 = 1. So, it's equal to the product of P(z) for z^13=1.

But the product over all z^13=1 of P(z) can be written as the product over z of (z² - 2z + 2). Since each z is a 13th root of unity, z^13 = 1.

Alternatively, think about evaluating the resultant or using properties of cyclotomic polynomials. Hmm, maybe I can use the fact that the product over z of (z - a) for all roots of z^n =1 is equal to z^n -1.

Wait, but here I have the product of (z² - 2z + 2) for each z where z^13=1. So, that's like evaluating the product of (z² - 2z + 2) for each root of z^13 -1=0.

I think there's a theorem or formula that relates the product of a polynomial evaluated at all roots of another polynomial. Let me recall.

I think it's related to the concept called the "multiplicative function over roots". If I have a polynomial Q(z) = z^13 -1, and another polynomial P(z) = z² - 2z + 2, then the product over all roots α of Q(z) of P(α) is equal to the resultant of Q and P, or something like that.

Alternatively, I remember that the product over all roots α of Q(z) of (a - α) is equal to Q(a) when Q is monic. Wait, no, that's not exactly right. Wait, if Q(z) = (z - α_1)(z - α_2)...(z - α_n), then the product over (a - α_i) = Q(a). But in our case, Q(z) is z^13 -1, which factors as (z -1)(z - ω)(z - ω²)...(z - ω¹²). So, if I set a variable, say w, then Q(w) = (w -1)(w - ω)...(w - ω¹²) = w^13 -1.

But in our problem, we have the product over z^13=1 of (z² - 2z + 2). So that's the product over all roots α of Q(z)=0 of P(α), where P(z)=z² - 2z + 2.

I think the product over all roots α of Q(z) of P(α) is equal to the resultant of Q and P, but I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, perhaps it's the product of P(α) for each root α of Q.

Wait, another idea: Since Q(z) = z^13 -1, and P(z) = z² - 2z + 2, then the product over all α (roots of Q) of P(α) is equal to the product over α of (α² - 2α + 2). Hmm, perhaps we can express this as a resultant or use some properties.

Wait, recall that the product over all roots α of Q(z) of P(α) is equal to the resultant of Q and P, which can be computed using determinants, but that's probably complicated. Alternatively, maybe using logarithms to turn the product into a sum? Not sure.

Another approach: Since Q(z) is the minimal polynomial for ω, perhaps we can express P(ω^k) in terms of Q and then find the product.

Alternatively, note that the product we're looking for is equal to the product over k=0 to 12 of (2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k}) = product over k=0 to 12 of (ω^{2k} - 2ω^k + 2).

Wait, perhaps I can write each term as a quadratic in ω^k. Let me see: For each term, 2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k} = ω^{2k} - 2ω^k + 2.

That's like (ω^k)^2 - 2ω^k + 2. Let me think of this as a quadratic in ω^k. Suppose I denote x = ω^
