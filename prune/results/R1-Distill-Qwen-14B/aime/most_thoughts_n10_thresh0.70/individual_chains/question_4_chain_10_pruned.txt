Okay, so I'm trying to solve this problem where Alice and Bob are playing a game with a stack of n tokens. They take turns removing either 1 or 4 tokens each time, and the person who takes the last token wins. I need to find how many positive integers n ≤ 2024 make it so that Bob can guarantee a win, regardless of how Alice plays.

Hmm, let's break this down. It sounds like a classic combinatorial game theory problem. I remember that these types of games often have winning and losing positions, where from a winning position, the player can force a win no matter what the opponent does, and from a losing position, no matter what the player does, the opponent can force a win.

So, the key is to figure out the losing positions here. If Bob can force Alice into a losing position on her first turn, then Bob can win. That means that for those n where it's a losing position, Bob can win if Alice is forced to start from a losing position.

Wait, no, wait. Wait a second. Wait, actually, the initial player is Alice. So if n is a losing position for the first player, then Bob can win. Because Alice would be in a losing position, and whatever she does, Bob can respond appropriately to bring Alice back to another losing position.

So, the problem reduces to finding all n ≤ 2024 such that n is a losing position for the first player, meaning Bob can win.

So, how do I find these losing positions? I think I can model this using dynamic programming or recursion. Let me try to think recursively.

Let’s define a position as losing if every possible move leads to a winning position for the opponent. Conversely, a position is winning if there exists at least one move that leads to a losing position for the opponent.

Let’s denote f(n) as true if the current player can force a win from n tokens, and false otherwise.

Base cases:
- f(0) = false (no tokens left; the player cannot move and loses)
- f(1) = true (take 1 token and win)
- f(2) = true (take 1 token, leaving 1 for the opponent, who can then win. Wait, no. Wait, if I take 1 from 2, leaving 1, which is a winning position for the opponent. So f(2) would be false? Let me think.

Wait no, because if I have 2 tokens, I can take 1, leaving 1 for the opponent. The opponent can take 1 and win. Alternatively, I could take 1, but wait, can I take 4 from 2? No, because n=2, you can't take 4. So only option is 1. So if n=2, the current player takes 1, leaving 1, which allows the opponent to win. So f(2) = false because the current player can't force a win. Wait, no. Wait, no, if I take 1 from 2, opponent is left with 1, which is a winning position for them. So yes, f(2) is false.

Wait, but that doesn't make sense because if n=1, the current player can take the token and win. So for n=2, the current player can only take 1, leaving n=1, which is
