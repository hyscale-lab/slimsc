Okay, so I have this problem about placing chips on a 5x5 grid. There are 25 white chips and 25 black chips, but I can only use some of them. Each cell can have at most one chip, and the conditions are that all chips in the same row must be the same color, and the same goes for columns. Also, once I place the chips, adding any more would break one of these rules. Hmm, interesting.

Let me try to break this down. First, each row can have either all white chips, all black chips, or no chips at all. The same goes for each column. But wait, actually, the problem says each cell can have at most one chip, so each cell can be either white, black, or empty. But the constraints are that in each row, all placed chips must be the same color, and same for each column.

Wait, so for any row that has at least one chip, all the chips in that row are the same color. Similarly for any column. That means if a row has some white chips, all the chips in that row must be white. Similarly for black. And the same for columns.

But then, there's another condition: any additional chip placed would violate one or more conditions. That suggests that the current placement is maximal, meaning we can't add any more chips without breaking the rules. So, the grid must be as full as possible under these constraints.

So, how can we model this? Maybe each row can be in one of three states: all white, all black, or empty. Similarly, each column can be all white, all black, or empty. But wait, there's a conflict here because the colors of rows and columns have to be consistent.

For example, if a row is white, then every column that intersects this row must also be white or empty. Because if a column has a black chip, and it intersects a white row, that would mean that cell is both white and black, which isn't allowed. So, the colors of the rows and columns must agree on the intersections.

Wait, perhaps the grid can be partitioned into regions where each region is a rectangle of the same color. Because if a row is white, then all the columns that intersect this row must also be white or empty. So, suppose I have a set of rows that are white, then all columns that intersect these rows must also be white or empty. Similarly, if a column is black, all rows that intersect it must be black or empty.

But maybe a better approach is to think in terms of which rows and columns we color. Let's say we choose some rows to be white and some to be black. Similarly for columns. But then, the intersection of a white row and a black column would be a conflict because that cell can't be both white and black. So, we need to ensure that the rows and columns we choose for colors don't conflict.

Wait, perhaps it's better to model this as a bipartite graph, where one partition is the rows and the other is the columns, and the edges represent cells. Then, coloring a row white or black would correspond to setting the color for all edges connected to that row node. Similarly for columns. But I'm not sure if that's the right way to go.

Alternatively, maybe each cell can only be white, black, or empty, but with the constraints
