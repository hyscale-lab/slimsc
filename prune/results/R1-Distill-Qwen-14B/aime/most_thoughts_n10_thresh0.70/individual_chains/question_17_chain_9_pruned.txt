Okay, so I have this problem about rectangular boxes with a given surface area and volume. I need to find the radius of the smallest sphere that can contain any of these boxes, and then express r squared as a fraction p/q where p and q are coprime, and finally find p + q.

Hmm, let's break this down. First, the problem mentions rectangular boxes, which means their dimensions are length, width, and height, say x, y, z. The surface area is given as 54, and the volume is 23.

So, surface area of a rectangular box is 2(xy + yz + xz) = 54. And the volume is xyz = 23.

I need to find the smallest sphere that can contain the box. The sphere must enclose the box, so the diameter of the sphere must be at least as large as the space diagonal of the box. That makes sense because the space diagonal is the longest distance between any two vertices of the box, and the sphere must encompass all of them. So, the radius would be half of that space diagonal.

The space diagonal d of a box with sides x, y, z is sqrt(x² + y² + z²). So, the radius r is (sqrt(x² + y² + z²))/2. Therefore, r² is (x² + y² + z²)/4.

So, my goal is to find the minimal possible value of (x² + y² + z²)/4, given that 2(xy + yz + xz) = 54 and xyz = 23.

Wait, no, actually, no, wait. The sphere must contain each box in set B, which consists of all boxes with surface area 54 and volume 23. So, each box in B has these two properties, and I need to find the minimal sphere that can contain any such box. So, the sphere's radius must be large enough to contain the box with the largest space diagonal among all boxes in B. So, I need to find the maximum possible space diagonal d = sqrt(x² + y² + z²) over all boxes in B, and then r is half of that maximum d.

So, I need to maximize x² + y² + z² given the constraints 2(xy + yz + xz) = 54 and xyz = 23.

So, how do I approach maximizing x² + y² + z² given these constraints?

I remember that in optimization problems with multiple constraints, methods like Lagrange multipliers can be used. Alternatively, maybe there's a way to express variables in terms of each other to reduce the number of variables.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use the method of symmetric inequalities or think about the relationship between the arithmetic mean, geometric mean, etc., but I'm not sure.

Let me write down the given constraints:

1. 2(xy + yz + xz) = 54 => xy + yz + xz = 27.

2. xyz = 23.

We need to maximize x² + y² + z².

I think using Lagrange multipliers would be the way to go here. So, let me set up the function to maximize: f(x, y, z) = x² + y² + z².

Subject to the constraints:
g(x, y, z) = xy + yz + xz = 27,
h(x, y, z) = xyz = 23.

Wait, but in Lagrange multipliers, usually, we handle one constraint at a time. But here, we have two constraints. So, I think I need to use the method of multiple constraints, which involves using gradients and multiple Lagrange multipliers.

Alternatively, maybe I can parameterize the problem. Let me see.

Suppose I consider that the problem is symmetric in x, y, z, so perhaps the maximum occurs when two variables are equal? Or maybe all three are equal?

Wait, if all three variables are
