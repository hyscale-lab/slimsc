Okay, I'm trying to solve this problem about a torus and a sphere. Let's see. So, the torus T is formed by revolving a circle with radius 3 around an axis that's in the same plane as the circle and 6 units away from the center. So, it's like a donut shape. The sphere S has a radius of 11.

The problem says when T rests on the inside of S, it's internally tangent along a circle with radius r_i. When it rests on the outside, it's externally tangent along a circle with radius r_o. We need to find r_i - r_o and express it as a fraction m/n where m and n are coprime, then find m + n.

Hmm. I'm a bit confused about what it means for the torus to rest on the inside or outside of the sphere. I think when it's resting on the inside, the torus is entirely contained within the sphere, touching it along a circle. Similarly, when it's outside, the sphere is inside the torus, touching along another circle. Wait, no, maybe the other way around. Wait, when it's resting on the inside, the torus is inside the sphere, so the sphere is larger. When it's resting on the outside, the torus is outside the sphere, so perhaps the sphere is inside the torus? But the torus is a surface, so I'm not sure about the exact configuration.

Wait, no. The torus is a surface, so when it's resting on the inside of the sphere, the sphere is enclosing the torus, and they are tangent. When it's resting on the outside, maybe the torus is enclosing the sphere? Or perhaps both are separate, but I think the external tangent is when the sphere is outside the torus, but that's not possible because the torus is a donut shape.

Wait, maybe I should think about the geometry more carefully. Let's try to model both situations.

First, I need to find the centers of the torus and the sphere when they are tangent. Let me consider the torus. A torus can be described with two radii: the major radius R, which is the distance from the center of the generating circle to the axis of revolution, and the minor radius r, which is the radius of the generating circle itself. In this case, the generating
