Okay, so I've got this problem here about rectangular boxes with a surface area of 54 and a volume of 23. I need to find the radius of the smallest sphere that can contain each of these boxes. Then, express r squared as a fraction p/q where p and q are coprime, and find p+q.

Hmm, let's start by understanding the problem. I have a set of boxes, all with surface area 54 and volume 23. Each box is a rectangular prism, so it has length, width, and height, say x, y, z. The sphere that can contain the box must have a diameter at least equal to the space diagonal of the box. So the radius would be half of that diagonal. Therefore, to minimize the sphere's radius, I need to minimize the space diagonal of the boxes in set B.

Wait, but the problem says "the radius of the smallest sphere that can contain each of the rectangular boxes". So, does that mean that the sphere must contain all possible boxes in B, or that for each box, find the minimal sphere containing it, and then find the maximum of those radii? Because if it's the former, then it's the sphere that can contain every box in B, regardless of their dimensions, which might have a different approach. But I think it's the latter: for each box, the minimal sphere that can contain it has a radius equal to half its space diagonal, so we need the maximum of these radii over all boxes in B. So the minimal enclosing sphere's radius for each box is half the space diagonal, and we need the maximum of that over all boxes in B.

So, to minimize the sphere's radius, we need to minimize the maximum space diagonal among all boxes in B. Wait, no, actually, since we need a sphere that can contain all boxes in B, the sphere must have a radius equal to the maximum space diagonal among all boxes in B divided by two. Because each box has its own space diagonal, and the sphere needs to be big enough to contain any box from B. So the radius r is equal to the maximum space diagonal over all boxes in B divided by 2. Therefore, r^2 would be (max space diagonal)^2 / 4.

So, first, I need to model the problem. Let me denote the dimensions of the box as x, y, z, all positive real numbers. Then, surface area S = 2(xy + yz + zx) = 54. Volume V = xyz = 23.

We need to find the maximum space diagonal D = sqrt(x^2 + y^2 + z^2) over all such boxes, and then r = D/2, so r^2 = (D^2)/4.

Therefore, the problem reduces to maximizing x^2 + y^2 + z^2 given that 2(xy + yz + zx) = 54 and xyz = 23.

So, now, I need to maximize x^2 + y^2 + z^2 under the constraints 2(xy + yz + zx) = 54 and xyz = 23.

I think this is an optimization problem with constraints. So, maybe I can use Lagrange multipliers. Let's set up the function to maximize: f(x, y, z) = x^2 + y^2 + z^2.

Subject to the constraints:

1. g(x, y, z) = 2(xy + yz + zx) - 54 = 0
2. h(x, y, z) = xyz - 23 = 0

So, the method of Lagrange multipliers with two constraints. The Lagrangian would be:

L = x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - λ(2(xy + yz + zx) - 54) - μ(xyz - 23)

Then, take partial derivatives with respect to x, y, z, set them equal to zero.

Partial derivative with respect to x:

dL/dx = 2x - λ(2(y + z)) - μ(yz) = 0

Similarly, dL/dy = 2y - λ(2(x + z)) - μ(xz) = 0

dL/dz = 2z - λ(2(x + y)) - μ(xy) = 0

And the constraints:

2(xy + yz + zx) = 54

xyz = 23

So, now we have a system of equations:

1. 2x - 2λ(y + z) - μ y z = 0
2. 2y - 2λ(x + z) - μ x z = 0
3. 2z - 2λ(x + y) - μ x y = 0
4. 2(xy + yz + zx) = 54
5. xyz = 23

Hmm, this looks complicated. Maybe I can assume that the maximum occurs when x = y = z? Wait, but if x = y = z, then the box is a cube. Let's see if that satisfies the constraints.

If x = y = z, then surface area S = 6x^2 =54 => x^2 =9 => x=3. Then volume V = x^3 =27. But in our case, V=23, which is less than 27. So the maximum volume for a given surface area is achieved by the cube, which has V=27. But here, V is less, so the cube isn't in our set B
