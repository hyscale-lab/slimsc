Okay, so I have this probability problem to solve, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again and try to understand what's being asked.

Jen enters a lottery by picking 4 distinct numbers from the set S, which is {1,2,3,...,9,10}. So, S has 10 numbers in total. Then, 4 numbers are randomly chosen from S. She wins a prize if at least two of her numbers are among the four chosen. She wins the grand prize if all four of her numbers are chosen. The question is about the probability of her winning the grand prize given that she won a prize. They say this probability is m/n, where m and n are coprime positive integers, and we need to find m + n.

Alright, so it's a conditional probability problem. The formula for conditional probability is P(A|B) = P(A ∩ B) / P(B). In this case, event A is winning the grand prize, and event B is winning a prize. So, we're looking for P(A|B) = P(A ∩ B) / P(B).

But wait, if A is winning the grand prize, then A is a subset of B because if she wins the grand prize, she must have at least two numbers correct. So, A is a subset of B, meaning that P(A ∩ B) is just P(A). Therefore, the formula simplifies to P(A) / P(B).

So, I need to calculate two probabilities: the probability of winning the grand prize (P(A)) and the probability of winning a prize (P(B)).

First, let's figure out the total number of possible ways 4 numbers can be chosen from S. Since S has 10 numbers, the number of possible combinations is C(10,4), which is 210.

Calculating P(A): Winning the grand prize means all four of her numbers are chosen. So, the number of favorable outcomes is 1, because there's only one way that all four of her specific numbers are selected. So, P(A) = 1 / C(10,4) = 1/210.

Wait, but hold on, actually, no. Because when considering the probability, it's about the number of favorable combinations over the total number of possible combinations. Since Jen is selecting 4 numbers, the total possible lottery outcomes are C(10,4) = 210. And the number of ways she can win the grand prize is exactly 1. So, yes, P(A) is 1/210.

Now, P(B) is the probability that she wins a prize, which means at least two of her four numbers are chosen. So, we need to calculate the number of ways she can have exactly two, exactly three, or exactly four numbers chosen. Then, sum those up and divide by the total number of possible combinations (210).

Wait, but maybe there's a better way. Instead of calculating all the favorable cases for B, perhaps we can calculate the probability of not winning a prize and subtract it from 1. So, P(B) = 1 - P(not winning a prize). P(not winning a prize) is the probability that fewer than two of her numbers are chosen, i.e., either zero or one of her numbers are in the chosen four.

So, let's compute P(not winning a prize). The number of ways to choose 4 numbers with zero of her numbers is C(6,4), since the 4 numbers are all from the remaining 6 numbers not in her chosen set. Similarly, the number of ways to choose 4 numbers with exactly one of her numbers is C(4,1)*C(6,3). Because we choose 1 from her 4 numbers and 3 from the remaining 6.

Let me compute these:

C(6,4) = 15.

C(4,1)*C(6,3) = 4 * 20 = 80.

So, the total number of ways to not win a prize is 15 + 80 = 95.

Therefore, P(not winning a prize) = 95 / 210. So, P(B) = 1 - 95/210 = (210 - 95)/210 = 115/210. Simplifying that, divide numerator and denominator by 5: 23/42. So, P(B) = 23/42.

Wait, let me double-check that calculation. So, if Jen has 4 numbers, the rest are 6. The number of ways to choose 4 numbers without any of hers is C(6,4)=15. For exactly one, it's 4 choices from hers multiplied by
