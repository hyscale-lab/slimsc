Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the number of rectangles that can be formed inside a fixed regular dodecagon. Each side of the rectangle lies on either a side or a diagonal of the dodecagon. Hmm, let me try to figure this out step by step.

First, I remember that a regular dodecagon has 12 sides, all of equal length and internal angles. It's a 12-sided polygon. Now, the problem is about finding rectangles inside it, where each side of the rectangle is either a side or a diagonal of the dodecagon.

I think the key here is to consider the symmetry of the dodecagon. Since it's regular, it has rotational and reflectional symmetry, which might help in counting the rectangles.

I remember that in regular polygons, especially those with an even number of sides, rectangles can be formed by connecting pairs of parallel sides or diagonals. Maybe I should consider the diagonals as well as the sides of the dodecagon.

Wait, but how do I systematically count all possible rectangles? Maybe I can think about selecting two pairs of parallel sides or diagonals that intersect each other, forming a rectangle.

In a regular dodecagon, the sides and diagonals can be categorized by their lengths. For example, sides are the shortest, then there are diagonals of different lengths depending on how many vertices they skip.

But for a rectangle, we need two pairs of parallel lines. So I need to find all sets of two pairs of parallel lines (sides or diagonals) that can form a rectangle.

Wait, but in a regular dodecagon, the number of possible pairs of parallel sides and diagonals depends on the step between the vertices. Let me think about the structure.

Each vertex in a regular dodecagon is connected to others by sides (step 1) or diagonals (steps 2, 3, ..., up to 5, since beyond that, the diagonals repeat on the other side due to the polygon being cyclic).

So, for each possible step k (where k is 1 to 5), the diagonals (or sides when k=1) are parallel if they are spaced appropriately.

Wait, for a regular polygon with n sides, two sides are parallel if the number of sides skipped is n/2. But wait, a dodecagon has 1
