Okay, so I have this problem about the residents of Aimeville and the things they own. Let me try to break it down step by step. Hmm, the problem says there are 900 residents in total. Each of them owns a bag of candy hearts, so that's one thing everyone has. Then, there are other items: diamond rings, golf clubs, and garden spades. The numbers given are 195 owning a diamond ring, 367 owning golf clubs, and 562 owning a garden spade. 

Wait, so the total number of residents is 900, and each owns at least the candy hearts. So candy hearts are like the universal set here. Then, the other three items are subsets of this. Now, the problem also mentions that each resident owns exactly two of these things, and some own exactly three. Specifically, 437 own exactly two, and 234 own exactly three. The question is asking for the number of residents who own all four things, which would include candy hearts plus the other three.

Let me recall some principles from set theory. I think this is a problem that involves the principle of inclusion-exclusion. Yes, inclusion-exclusion helps calculate the union of multiple sets by considering their intersections. But wait, in this case, we're given some specific numbers about exactly two and exactly three ownerships. Hmm, how does that fit into inclusion-exclusion?

Let me think. The inclusion-exclusion principle for four sets says that the total number of elements in the union is equal to the sum of the sizes of the individual sets minus the sum of all pairwise intersections plus the sum of all triple-wise intersections minus the four-way intersection. But in this problem, we're given some information about exactly two and exactly three ownerships. So maybe I need to relate that to the inclusion-exclusion formula.

Wait, another approach: the problem gives the counts of people owning exactly two and exactly three items, which might help us find the four-way intersection. Let me think about the formula for the union of four sets. The formula is:

|A ∪ B ∪ C ∪ D| = |A| + |B| + |C| + |D| - |A∩B| - |A∩C| - |A∩D| - |B∩C| - |B∩D| - |C∩D| + |
