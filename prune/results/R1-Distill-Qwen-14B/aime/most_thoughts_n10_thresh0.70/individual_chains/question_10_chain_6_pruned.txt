Okay, so I've got this math problem here, and I need to figure out the sum of the elements in set A. Let me read through it again and try to understand what's going on.

Alice chooses a set A of positive integers. Then Bob lists all finite nonempty sets B of positive integers with the property that the maximum element of B belongs to A. Bob's list has 2024 sets. I need to find the sum of the elements of A.

Hmm. So, let me try to break this down. Alice has a set A, and Bob is creating sets B where each B is a finite, nonempty set of positive integers. The key condition is that the maximum element of B must be in A. And the total number of such sets B is 2024. The question is to find the sum of the elements in A.

I think the key is to figure out how the size of set A relates to the number of possible sets B that Bob can list. Let me try to model this.

Let me denote the elements in A as a1, a2, ..., an, where each ai is a positive integer. Since A is a set, all elements are distinct and can be ordered without loss of generality as a1 < a2 < ... < an. 

Now, Bob is creating sets B where each B is finite, nonempty, and the maximum element of B is in A. So, for each element a in A, how many sets B can have a as their maximum?

If a is the maximum element of B, then the other elements of B must be chosen from the positive integers less than a. So, for each a in A, the number of possible subsets B with maximum a is equal to the number of subsets of {1, 2, ..., a-1}, including the empty set, but since B must be non-empty, we subtract 1.

Wait, no. Wait, because if the maximum is a, then the other elements can be any subset of {1, 2, ..., a-1}, including the empty set. But since B must be non-empty, the set {a} is included when the other elements are empty. So, the number of such subsets is 2^{a-1}.

Wait, but let me think again. For each a, the number of possible B with maximum a is 2^{a-1}. Because you can choose any subset of the numbers less than a, and then add a to it as the maximum. So for a particular a, the number of possible B is 2^{a-1}.

But wait, but if A has multiple elements, say a1, a2, ..., an, then the sets B where the maximum is a1, a2, etc., are all disjoint. So, the total number of B sets is the sum of 2^{a-1} for each a in A.

Wait, but that might not be correct because if A has elements that are not consecutive, or if some elements are not in order, maybe there's an overlap? Wait, no, because if the maximum is a1, then all those B's can't have a maximum greater than a1. Similarly, for a2, which is larger than a1, the subsets are built from numbers less than
