Okay, so I have this problem where there are four points A, B, C, D on a hyperbola given by the equation x²/20 - y²/24 = 1. These four points form a rhombus ABCD, and the diagonals of this rhombus intersect at the origin. I need to find the greatest real number that is less than BD² for all such rhombi. Hmm, okay.

First, let me recall what a rhombus is. A rhombus is a quadrilateral with all sides equal in length, and its diagonals bisect each other at right angles. Wait, no, that's a kite. Actually, in a rhombus, the diagonals bisect each other and bisect the angles, but they aren't necessarily perpendicular unless it's a square. Wait, no, correction: in a rhombus, the diagonals are not equal but they do bisect each other at right angles. So, yes, the diagonals are perpendicular bisectors of each other.

Given that ABCD is a rhombus, the diagonals AC and BD intersect at the origin, which is their midpoint. So, the origin is the midpoint of both diagonals. Therefore, if point A is (x, y), then point C, being the opposite vertex, will be (-x, -y). Similarly, if point B is (p, q), then point D will be (-p, -q).

So, the four points are A(x, y), B(p, q), C(-x, -y), D(-p, -q). Now, since all four points lie on the hyperbola x²/20 - y²/24 = 1, each point must satisfy this equation. So, for point A: x²/20 - y²/24 = 1, and similarly for points B, C, D: p²/20 - q²/24 = 1.

Now, since ABCD is a rhombus, all sides must be equal. So, the distance between A and B must be equal to the distance between B and C, and so on.

But thinking about all sides being equal might be complicated because it's a rhombus with diagonals intersecting at the origin. Maybe it's easier to use properties of the rhombus in terms of vectors or coordinates.

Since the diagonals bisect each other, vectors OA and OC are opposites, as are OB and OD. So, the diagonals are AC and BD.

In a rhombus, the diagonals are perpendicular. So, the product of their slopes should be -1.

Wait, but the diagonals are AC and BD. Let's compute their slopes.

Slope of AC: Points A(x, y) and C(-x, -y). So, the slope is ( -y - y ) / (-x - x) = (-2y)/(-2x) = y/x.

Similarly, slope of BD: Points B(p, q) and D(-p, -q). Slope is ( -q - q ) / ( -p - p ) = (-2q)/(-2p) = q/p.

Since they are perpendicular, their slopes multiply to -1: (y/x) * (q/p) = -1.

So, (y q)/(x p) = -1 → y q = -x p.

So, that's one condition we have: y q = -x p.

Another thing is that the diagonals of a rhombus bisect each other at the origin, so the origin is the midpoint of both diagonals.

Now, since the diagonals of a rhombus are perpendicular, the rhombus can be considered as formed by vectors along the diagonals. So, if I take vectors OA and OB, but wait, no, OA and OC are the endpoints of one diagonal, and OB and OD are endpoints of the other diagonal.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider the vectors of the sides. Let me think.

Alternatively, perhaps using the properties of the rhombus in terms of coordinates, given that the points lie on the
