Okay, so I've got this problem here where I need to find the number of intersections between two graphs. The functions are given as y = 4 g(f(sin(2πx))) and x = 4 g(f(cos(3πy))). Hmm, that looks a bit complicated, but let's break it down step by step.

First, I need to understand what f(x) and g(x) are. The problem defines f(x) = ||x| - 1/2| and g(x) = ||x| - 1/4|. So both f and g are absolute value functions, but with some modifications.

Let me visualize f(x) and g(x). For f(x), it's the absolute value of |x| minus 1/2. So normally, |x| is a V-shaped graph that's symmetric about the y-axis, with its vertex at (0,0). When we subtract 1/2 inside the absolute value, it shifts the vertex upwards by 1/2. But wait, no, actually, wait. The subtraction is inside the absolute value, so maybe the transformation is different. Let me clarify.

Wait, no. Let me correct myself. The function f(x) is ||x| - 1/2|. So first, we take |x|, which is a V-shape, then subtract 1/2, and then take the absolute value of that result. Hmm, that's a bit different. So let's think about it.

The inner function is |x| - 1/2. So when |x| is greater than or equal to 1/2, that inner expression is non-negative, so f(x) = |x| - 1/2. But when |x| is less than 1/2, the inner expression is negative, so the absolute value of that would be 1/2 - |x|. So f(x) is a piecewise function:

f(x) = |x| - 1/2, when |x| >= 1/2,
f(x) = 1/2 - |x|, when |x| < 1/2.

So if I plot this, for |x| >= 1/2, it's a V-shape starting at (1/2, 0) and going upwards, and similarly on the negative side. Between -1/2 and 1/2, it's an upside-down V, peaking at (0, 1/2). So f(x) looks like a W shape? Wait, no. Wait, let me think again. Wait, for x between -1/2 and 1/2, f(x) is 1/2 minus |x|, which is a tent function peaking at x=0 with value 1/2. For x beyond 1/2 or less than -1/2, it's |x| - 1/2, which is like Vs starting at (1/2, 0) going upwards.

Similarly, g(x) is ||x| - 1/4|. So same idea, but subtracting 1/4. So g(x) is piecewise:

g(x) = |x| - 1/4 when |x| >= 1/4,
g(x) = 1/4 - |x| when |x| < 1/4.

So g(x) has a tent between -1/4 and 1/4, peaking at (0,1/4), and Vs beyond that.

Now, the functions in the problem are y = 4 g(f(sin(2πx))) and x = 4 g(f(cos(3πy))). So both functions are built by composing f, then g, then scaling by 4, and applied to sin(2πx) and cos(3πy) respectively.

Since we're dealing with intersections, we need to solve for (x, y) where both equations are satisfied. So that would mean substituting one into the other. But since one is y expressed in terms of x, and the other is x expressed in terms of y, maybe I can set them equal.

Wait, but how? Let me think. Let's denote the first function as y = 4 g(f(sin(2πx))), and the second as x = 4 g(f(cos(3πy))). So at the point of intersection (x, y), both equations hold.

So substituting, we can say that y = 4 g(f(sin(2πx))) and x = 4 g(f(cos(3πy))). So perhaps we can substitute the expression for y into the equation for x. Let me try that.

So substituting y from the first equation into the second:

x = 4 g(f(cos(3π * y))) = 4 g(f(cos(3π * [4 g(f
