Okay, so I've got this problem here: Let ω ≠ 1 be a 13th root of unity. I need to find the remainder when the product from k=0 to 12 of (2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k}) is divided by 1000. Hmm, that sounds a bit intimidating at first, but let's try to break it down.

First, I remember that roots of unity have some nice properties. Since ω is a 13th root of unity, that means ω^13 = 1, and ω^k for k=0 to 12 are all the distinct roots. Also, the minimal polynomial for ω is the 13th cyclotomic polynomial, which is Φ₁₃(x) = x¹² + x¹¹ + ... + x + 1. I think that might come into play here.

The product I'm looking at is from k=0 to 12 of (2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k}). That seems like a product over all the roots of unity, so maybe I can find a clever way to relate this to polynomials or something else.

Wait, let's look at the term inside the product: 2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k}. Maybe I can factor this or write it in a different form. Let me see: 2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k} can be rearranged as ω^{2k} - 2ω^k + 2. Hmm, that looks like a quadratic in terms of ω^k. Let me treat ω^k as a variable, say z. Then the expression becomes z² - 2z + 2.

So, for each k, we're evaluating the quadratic z² - 2z + 2 at z = ω^k. So the product becomes the product from k=0 to 12 of (ω^{2k} - 2ω^k + 2). But wait, ω^0 is 1, so when k=0, the term is 1² - 2*1 + 2 = 1 - 2 + 2 = 1. So the first term is just 1. Hmm, that might be helpful.

So the product is equal to 1 * product from k=1 to 12 of (ω^{2k} - 2ω^k + 2). Because when k=0, it's 1, and the other terms are from k=1 to 12.

Now, I need to compute the product from k=1 to 12 of (ω^{2k} - 2ω^k + 2). Let me see if I can relate this product to a polynomial evaluated at some point.

Since ω is a root of Φ₁₃(x) = x¹² + x¹¹ + ... + x + 1 = 0, maybe I can find a polynomial whose roots are ω^k for k=1 to 12, which is exactly Φ₁₃(x). So perhaps I can find a polynomial whose roots are z = ω^k, then express this product in terms of that polynomial.

Wait, the product from k=1 to 12 of (z - (ω^k)) is Φ₁₃(z). But here, instead of (z - ω^k), we have (ω^{2k} - 2ω^k + 2). Hmm, not sure yet.

Wait, let me think differently. Let's consider the expression (2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k}) for each k. As I noticed, that's equal to (ω^k)^2 - 2ω^k + 2. So, perhaps if I consider a polynomial f(x) = x² - 2x + 2, then our term is f(ω^k).

So, the product from k=0 to 12 of f(ω^k) is the product over all 13th roots of unity of f(ω^k). But wait, ω is a primitive 13th root, so all the ω^k are distinct roots.

I remember that for a polynomial P(x), the product over all roots α of (x - α) is P(x). But in this case, I'm evaluating f at each root, so perhaps the product becomes something like the resultant or something related.

Wait, another approach: There's a formula for the product of a polynomial evaluated at all roots of another polynomial. Specifically, if f(x) is a polynomial and P(x) is another polynomial with roots α_i, then the product of f(α_i) over all roots α_i of P(x) is equal to the resultant of f and P, which can be expressed as the product of f evaluated at each root of P, considering their multiplicities.

But in our case, P(x) = Φ₁₃(x), which is the minimal polynomial for ω, and f(x) is x² - 2x + 2. So the product we're seeking is the product of f(ω^k) for k=0 to 12. Since ω^0 = 1, which is a root of x - 1, but Φ₁₃(x) doesn't include x - 1 because 1 is not a primitive 13th root.

Wait, actually, Φ₁₃(x) is the product of (x - ω^k) for k=1 to 12. So our product is f(1) * product from k=1 to 12 of f(ω^k). Since f(1) = 1² - 2*1 + 2 = 1, as we saw earlier, so the total product is product from k=1 to 12 of f(ω^k).

So, product from k=1 to 12 of (ω^{2k} - 2ω^k + 2) = product from k=1 to 12 of f(ω^k).

As I thought earlier, maybe we can compute this product using properties of polynomials. Specifically, since Φ₁₃(x) is the minimal polynomial for ω, and f(x) is a quadratic, perhaps we can find an expression for the product of f(ω^k) over k=1 to 12.

I remember that if P(x) is a polynomial with roots α_1, α_2, ..., α_n, then product_{i=1 to n} f(α_i) is equal to the resultant of f(x) and P(x), which is the same as the product of f(α_i) for each root α_i of P(x).

Alternatively, there's a formula where the product over roots α of P(x) of f(α) is equal to the resultant of P(x) and f(x). But I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact formula. Let me try to recall.

Wait, the resultant of two polynomials P and Q is the product of Q(α_i) for all roots α_i of P, assuming P is monic. So, if P(x) is monic, then Res(P, Q) = product_{i=1 to n} Q(α_i), where α_i are the roots of P(x).

In our case, P(x) is Φ₁₃(x), which is monic, and Q(x) is f(x) = x² - 2x + 2.

So, Res(Φ₁₃, f) = product_{k=1 to 12} f(ω^k). Which is exactly the product we need.

So, if I can compute the resultant of Φ₁₃(x) and f(x), that will give me the product. Now, how do I compute the resultant of two polynomials?

One way is to use the formula involving determinants, but that's complicated. Another approach is to use polynomial division or look for a relation between P(x) and f(x).

Alternatively, since Φ₁₃(x) is a cyclotomic polynomial, maybe we can find a relation between f(x) and Φ₁₃(x). Let me think.

Wait, another approach: The product over k=1 to 12 of (x - ω^k) is Φ₁₃(x). So, product over k=1 to 12 of f(ω^k) is product over k=1 to 12 of (ω^{2k} - 2ω^k + 2).

Wait, perhaps we can write this as product over k=1 to 12 of (2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k}) = product over k=1 to 12 of (2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k}).

Hmm, I think another approach is to note that since ω is a root of Φ₁₃(x), we can express higher powers of ω in terms of lower powers. But I'm not sure how that helps here.

Wait, another thought: Let me consider f(x) = x² - 2x + 2. Let me compute f(ω^k). So, f(ω^k) = ω^{2k} - 2ω^k + 2.

Let me write this as ω^{2k} - 2ω^k + 2. I wonder if this can be factored or related to another polynomial.

Alternatively, perhaps I can write f(ω^k) = (ω^k - a)(ω^k - b) where a and b are roots of f(x). Let's find the roots of f(x). f(x) = x² - 2x + 2. Using quadratic formula: x = [2 ± sqrt(4 - 8)] / 2 = [2 ± sqrt(-4)] / 2 = [2 ± 2i] / 2 = 1 ± i.

So, the roots are 1 + i and 1 - i. So, f(x) = (x - (1 + i))(x - (1 - i)).

Therefore, f(ω^k) = (ω^k - (1 + i))(ω^k - (1 - i)).

So, the product from k=1 to 12 of f(ω^k) = product from k=1 to 12 of (ω^k - (1 + i))(ω^k - (1 - i)).

Which can be written as [product from k=1 to 12 (ω^k - (1 + i))] * [product from k=1 to 12 (ω^k - (1 - i))].

Hmm, now, the product from k=1 to 12 of (ω^k - a) is equal to Φ₁₃(a), because Φ₁₃(x) = product from k=1 to 12 (x - ω^k). So, if we substitute x = a, we get Φ₁₃(a) = product from k=1 to 12 (a - ω^k). But our product is product (ω^k - a) = (-1)^12 product (a - ω^k) = Φ₁₃(a), since (-1)^12 is 1.

So, product from k=1 to 12 (ω^k - a) = Φ₁₃(a).

Therefore, the product from k=1 to 12 of f(ω^k) = Φ₁₃(1 + i) * Φ₁₃(1 - i).

So, now I need to compute Φ₁₃(1 + i) and Φ₁₃(1 - i), then multiply them together.

Hmm, okay, Φ₁₃(x) is the 13th cyclotomic polynomial, which is Φ₁₃(x) = x¹² + x¹¹ + ... + x + 1. Alternatively, it can be expressed as Φ₁₃(x) = (x¹³ - 1)/(x - 1).

So, Φ₁₃(x) = (x¹³ - 1)/(x - 1). So, maybe I can compute Φ₁₃(1 + i) = ( (1 + i)^13 - 1 ) / ( (1 + i) - 1 ) = ( (1 + i)^13 - 1 ) / (i).

Similarly, Φ₁₃(1 - i) = ( (1 - i)^13 - 1 ) / ( (1 - i) - 1 ) = ( (1 - i)^13 - 1 ) / (-i).

So, now let's compute these two terms: Φ₁₃(1 + i) and Φ₁₃(1 - i).

First, compute (1 + i)^13 and (1 - i)^13.

I remember that 1 + i can be represented in polar form. The modulus is sqrt(2), and the angle is π/4 radians. So, 1 + i = sqrt(2) * e^{iπ/4}. Similarly, 1 - i = sqrt(2) * e^{-iπ/4}.

Therefore, (1 + i)^13 = [sqrt(2)]^13 * e^{i * 13π/4}.

Similarly, (1 - i)^13 = [sqrt(2)]^13 * e^{-i * 13π/4}.

Compute [sqrt(2)]^13: sqrt(2) is 2^{1/2}, so [2^{1/2}]^13 = 2^{13/2} = 2^6 * 2^{1/2} = 64 * sqrt(2).

Now, let's compute the angles. 13π/4 radians.

But 13π/4 is equal to 3π + π/4, since 3π is 12π/4. So, 13π/4 is equivalent to π/4 in the third revolution. Wait, no, more accurately, angles are modulo 2π, so 13π/4 - 2π = 13π/4 - 8π/4 = 5π/4. So, 13π/4 is the same as 5π/4 radians.

Similarly, -13π/4 is the same as -13π/4 + 4π = (-13π + 16π)/4 = 3π/4. So, e^{-i 13π/4} = e^{-i 3π/4}.

Wait, let me confirm:

For (1 + i)^13: 13π/4 is 3π + π/4, but since the exponential function is periodic with period 2π, we can subtract 2π to get an equivalent angle.

13π/4 - 2π = 13π/4 - 8π/4 = 5π/4.

Similarly, for (1 - i)^13: the angle is -13π/4. Let's add 4π (which is 2*2π) to get an equivalent positive angle.

-13π/4 + 4π = (-13π + 16π)/4 = 3π/4.

So, (1 + i)^13 = 64 * sqrt(2) * e^{i5π/4} and (1 - i)^13 = 64 * sqrt(2) * e^{-i3π/4}.

But wait, e^{i5π/4} is equal to e^{i(π + π/4)} = -e^{iπ/4} = -(sqrt(2)/2 + i sqrt(2)/2) = (-sqrt(2)/2 - i sqrt(2)/2).

Similarly, e^{-i3π/4} = e^{-i(π + π/4)} = -e^{-iπ/4} = -(sqrt(2)/2 - i sqrt(2)/2) = (-sqrt(2)/2 + i sqrt(2)/2).

So, let's compute (1 + i)^13:

(1 + i)^13 = 64 * sqrt(2) * (-sqrt(2)/2 - i sqrt(2)/2) = 64 * sqrt(2) * (-sqrt(2)/2 (1 + i)).

Simplify sqrt(2)*sqrt(2) = 2, so:

64 * (-2/2) (1 + i) = 64 * (-1) (1 + i) = -64(1 + i).

Similarly, (1 - i)^13 = 64 * sqrt(2) * (-sqrt(2)/2 + i sqrt(2)/2) = 64 * sqrt(2) * (-sqrt(2)/2)(1 - i).

Again, sqrt(2)*sqrt(2) = 2:

64 * (-2/2)(1 - i) = 64 * (-1)(1 - i) = -64(1 - i).

So, now, we can compute Φ₁₃(1 + i) and Φ₁₃(1 - i).

Φ₁₃(1 + i) = [ (1 + i)^13 - 1 ] / ( (1 + i) - 1 ) = [ -64(1 + i) - 1 ] / (i) = [ -64 -64i -1 ] / i = [ -65 -64i ] / i.

Similarly, Φ₁₃(1 - i) = [ (1 - i)^13 - 1 ] / ( (1 - i) - 1 ) = [ -64(1 - i) - 1 ] / (-i) = [ -64 +64i -1 ] / (-i) = [ -65 +64i ] / (-i).

Now, let's compute these two fractions.

First, Φ₁₃(1 + i):

[ -65 -64i ] / i.

Multiply numerator and denominator by -i to rationalize the denominator:

[ (-65 -64i)(-i) ] / (i * -i) = [ 65i +64i² ] / (1) because i*(-i)=1.

But i² = -1, so 64i² = -64. So:

65i -64.

So Φ₁₃(1 + i) = 65i -64.

Similarly, compute Φ₁₃(1 - i):

[ -65 +64i ] / (-i).

Multiply numerator and denominator by i:

[ (-65 +64i)(i) ] / ( (-i)*i ) = [ -65i +64i² ] / 1.

Again, i² = -1, so 64i² = -64.

So:

-65i -64.

Therefore, Φ₁₃(1 - i) = -65i -64.

Now, we have Φ₁₃(1 + i) = -64 +65i, and Φ₁₃(1 - i) = -64 -65i.

Wait, wait, let me check that calculation again.

Wait, for Φ₁₃(1 + i):

[ -65 -64i ] / i.

Multiply numerator and denominator by (-i):

Numerator: (-65)(-i) + (-64i)(-i) = 65i +64i² = 65i -64.

Denominator: i*(-i) = -i² = 1.

So, the result is 65i -64.

Similarly, Φ₁₃(1 - i):

[ -65 +64i ] / (-i).

Multiply numerator and denominator by i:

Numerator: (-65)(i) +64i(i) = -65i +64i² = -65i -64.

Denominator: (-i)*i = -i² = 1.

So, the result is -65i -64.

So, Φ₁₃(1 + i) = -64 +65i, and Φ₁₃(1 - i) = -64 -65i.

So, the product Φ₁₃(1 + i) * Φ₁₃(1 - i) is (-64 +65i)(-64 -65i).

This is a product of a complex number and its conjugate, which is |a|².

So, (-64)^2 - (65i)^2 = 4096 - (65)^2*(-1) = 4096 + 4225 = 8321.

Wait, let's compute it directly:

(-64 +65i)(-64 -65i) = (-64)^2 - (65i)^2 = 4096 - (4225)(i²) = 4096 - (4225)(-1) = 4096 + 4225 = 8321.

So, the product is 8321.

Wait, but wait, earlier I had the product from k=1 to 12 of f(ω^k) = Φ₁₃(1 + i) * Φ₁₃(1 - i) = 8321.

But earlier, the entire product from k=0 to 12 is equal to 1 * product from k=1 to 12 f(ω^k) = 8321.

Wait, but that can't be, because 8321 is a positive integer. But let me check whether that's correct.

Wait, I think I made a mistake in the sign when computing Φ₁₃(1 + i). Let me re-examine that.

Wait, let me compute Φ₁₃(1 + i) again.

(1 + i)^13 = -64(1 + i), right?

So, [ (1 + i)^13 - 1 ] = -64(1 + i) -1 = -64 -64i -1 = -65 -64i.

Then, Φ₁₃(1 + i) = (-65 -64i)/(i) = (-65 -64i)/i.

Multiply numerator and denominator by -i:

Numerator: (-65)(-i) + (-64i)(-i) = 65i +64i² = 65i -64.

Denominator: i*(-i) = -i² = 1.

So, Φ₁₃(1 + i) = 65i -64.

Similarly, Φ₁₃(1 - i) = (-65 +64i)/(-i) = (-65 +64i)/(-i).

Multiply numerator and denominator by i:

Numerator: (-65)(i) +64i(i) = -65i +64i² = -65i -64.

Denominator: (-i)(i) = -i² = 1.

So, Φ₁₃(1 - i) = -65i -64.

Thus, the product is (65i -64)(-65i -64) = (-64 +65i)(-64 -65i) = (-64)^2 - (65i)^2 = 4096 - (4225)(i²) = 4096 - (-4225) = 4096 + 4225 = 8321.

Yes, that's correct. So, the product from k=0 to 12 of (2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k}) = 8321.

Wait, but 8321 is the product from k=1 to 12, but the original product includes k=0, which is 1. So, the total product is indeed 8321.

Wait, but wait, I thought the product from k=0 to 12 is 1 * product from k=1 to 12, which is 8321. So, yes, the total product is 8321.

So, the problem asks for the remainder when this product is divided by 1000. So, compute 8321 mod 1000.

8321 divided by 1000 is 8*1000 = 8000, with a remainder of 321. So, 8321 mod 1000 is 321.

Wait, but is that correct? Because 8000 + 321 = 8321. Yes, so the remainder is 321.

So, the answer should be 321.

Wait, but let me double-check to make sure I didn't make any mistakes in my calculations.

Wait, let's recap:

The product we're looking for is product_{k=0}^{12} (2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k}) = product_{k=0}^{12} f(ω^k), where f(x) = x² - 2x + 2.

We know that f(ω^0) = f(1) = 1, so the product is 1 * product_{k=1}^{12} f(ω^k).

Then, we expressed product_{k=1}^{12} f(ω^k) as Φ₁₃(1 + i) * Φ₁₃(1 - i), which we computed as 8321.

Then, 8321 mod 1000 is 321.

Wait, but let me check whether Φ₁₃(x) is indeed (x^13 - 1)/(x - 1). Yes, that's correct.

And when we computed Φ₁₃(1 + i) and Φ₁₃(1 - i), we correctly found them to be 65i -64 and -65i -64, respectively. Then, their product is (-64 +65i)(-64 -65i) = 4096 + 4225 = 8321.

Yes, that seems correct.

So, the remainder when 8321 is divided by 1000 is 321. So, the answer should be 321.

But wait, just to be thorough, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the polar form calculations.

We had (1 + i)^13: modulus is sqrt(2), angle π/4. So, (sqrt(2))^13 = (2^{1/2})^13 = 2^{13/2} = 2^6 * 2^{1/2} = 64 * sqrt(2). Correct.

Angle: 13 * π/4 = 13π/4, which is 3π + π/4, which is equivalent to 5π/4 (since 13π/4 - 2π = 5π/4). So, (1 + i)^13 = 64 * sqrt(2) * e^{i5π/4} = 64 * sqrt(2) * (cos(5π/4) + i sin(5π/4)).

cos(5π/4) = -sqrt(2)/2, sin(5π/4) = -sqrt(2)/2. So, 64 * sqrt(2) * (-sqrt(2)/2 - i sqrt(2)/2) = 64 * ( -1 -i ), because sqrt(2)*sqrt(2) = 2, so 64 * ( -2/2 -i 2/2 ) = 64*(-1 -i) = -64(1 + i). Correct.

Similarly for (1 - i)^13, same modulus, angle -π/4. So, 13*(-π/4) = -13π/4. Adding multiples of 2π until we get an angle between 0 and 2π: -13π/4 + 4π = (-13π + 16π)/4 = 3π/4. So, angle 3π/4.

cos(3π/4) = -sqrt(2)/2, sin(3π/4) = sqrt(2)/2. So, (1 - i)^13 = 64 * sqrt(2) * (cos(3π/4) + i sin(3π/4)) = 64 * sqrt(2) * (-sqrt(2)/2 + i sqrt(2)/2) = 64*(-1 + i). Wait, wait, no: 64 * sqrt(2) * (-sqrt(2)/2 + i sqrt(2)/2) = 64 * (-1 + i). Because sqrt(2)*sqrt(2) = 2, so 64 * [ (-sqrt(2)/2)*sqrt(2) + i (sqrt(2)/2)*sqrt(2) ] = 64 * [ (-1) + i (1) ] = -64 +64i.

Wait, but earlier I thought (1 - i)^13 was -64(1 - i). Wait, that would be -64 +64i, which matches.

So, that's correct.

Then, Φ₁₃(1 + i) = [ (1 + i)^13 - 1 ] / ( (1 + i) - 1 ) = [ -64(1 + i) - 1 ] / (i ) = [ -65 -64i ] / i.

Which, when multiplied by -i, gives 65i -64. Correct.

Similarly, Φ₁₃(1 - i ) = [ -65 +64i ] / (-i ) = [ -65 +64i ] * i / ( (-i)*i ) = [ (-65i +64i²) ] / 1 = (-65i -64 ). Correct.

So, their product is (-64 +65i)(-64 -65i) = (-64)^2 - (65i)^2 = 4096 - (4225)(-1) = 4096 + 4225 = 8321. Correct.

Therefore, the product is 8321, and 8321 mod 1000 is 321.

So, the remainder is 321.


To solve the problem, we start by recognizing that ω is a primitive 13th root of unity, meaning ω¹³ = 1 and ωᵏ for k = 0, 1, ..., 12 are all distinct roots. The given product is:

\[
\prod_{k=0}^{12}(2 - 2\omega^k + \omega^{2k})
\]

We observe that each term can be written as \( f(\omega^k) \) where \( f(x) = x^2 - 2x + 2 \). The product then becomes:

\[
\prod_{k=0}^{12} f(\omega^k)
\]

Since ωᵏ for k = 0, 1, ..., 12 are all the 13th roots of unity, the product can be expressed as the resultant of the cyclotomic polynomial Φ₁₃(x) and f(x). The cyclotomic polynomial Φ₁₃(x) is given by:

\[
\Phi_{13}(x) = \frac{x^{13} - 1}{x - 1}
\]

We compute the product by evaluating Φ₁₃ at the roots of f(x). The roots of f(x) are 1 ± i, so we need to compute Φ₁₃(1 + i) and Φ₁₃(1 - i).

Using polar forms and De Moivre's theorem, we find:

\[
(1 + i)^{13} = -64(1 + i), \quad (1 - i)^{13} = -64(1 - i)
\]

Substituting into Φ₁₃(x):

\[
\Phi_{13}(1 + i) = \frac{(1 + i)^{13} - 1}{(1 + i) - 1} = \frac{-64(1 + i) - 1}{i} = 65i - 64
\]
\[
\Phi_{13}(1 - i) = \frac{(1 - i)^{13} - 1}{(1 - i) - 1} = \frac{-64(1 - i) - 1}{-i} = -65i - 64
\]

Multiplying these results:

\[
\Phi_{13}(1 + i) \cdot \Phi_{13}(1 - i) = (-64 + 65i)(-64 - 65i) = 4096 + 4225 = 8321
\]

Thus, the product is 8321. To find the remainder when 8321 is divided by 1000:

\[
8321 \mod 1000 = 321
\]

The final answer is:

\[
\boxed{321}
\]
