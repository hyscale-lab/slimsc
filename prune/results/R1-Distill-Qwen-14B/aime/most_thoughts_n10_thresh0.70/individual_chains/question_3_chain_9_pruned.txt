Okay, so Jen is entering a lottery where she picks 4 distinct numbers from the set S = {1,2,3,...,10}. Then, 4 numbers are randomly chosen from S. She wins a prize if at least two of her numbers match the randomly chosen ones, and she wins the grand prize if all four of her numbers match. We need to find the probability that she wins the grand prize given that she won a prize. The answer should be in the form m/n where m and n are coprime, and then find m + n.

Alright, let me break this down. It's a conditional probability problem. The formula for conditional probability is P(A|B) = P(A ∩ B) / P(B), but in this case, if she wins the grand prize, she must have won a prize as well. So, A is winning the grand prize, and B is winning a prize. Therefore, P(A ∩ B) is just P(A), because winning the grand prize implies winning a prize.

So, the probability we need is P(A) / P(B). That is, the probability of winning the grand prize divided by the probability of winning any prize.

First, let's compute P(A), the probability of winning the grand prize. This is the probability that all four of her numbers are the same as the four randomly chosen. So, how many ways are there to choose 4 numbers from 10? That's the combination C(10,4). So, the total number of possible outcomes is C(10,4). The number of favorable outcomes for the grand prize is just 1, since there's only one set of four numbers that Jen could have picked. So, P(A) = 1 / C(10,4).

Calculate C(10,4): 10! / (4! * (10-4)!) = (10*9*8*7)/(4*3*2*1) = 210. So, P(A) is 1/210.

Next, compute P(B), the probability of winning a prize, which means at least two of her numbers match the four randomly chosen. So, B is the event that she has 2, 3, or 4 matching numbers. So, we need to calculate the probability of having exactly 2, exactly 3, or exactly 4 matches.

Alternatively, another approach is to compute 1 minus the probability of having fewer than 2 matches, i.e., 1 - [probability of 0 matches + probability of 1 match]. But sometimes it's easier to compute the probabilities directly for 2,3,4.

Let me think about how to compute the number of favorable outcomes for each case.

Case 1: Exactly 2 matches.

To compute the number of ways where exactly two of Jen's numbers match the four chosen, we can think of it as:

- Choose 2 numbers from Jen's 4 that match the winning numbers.
- The remaining 2 numbers in the winning set must come from the 6 numbers Jen did not choose.

Wait, no. Wait, hold on. Let me clarify.

Actually, the four randomly chosen numbers are the winning numbers. So, when calculating the number of ways that exactly two of Jen's numbers match, it's:

- Choose 2 numbers from the 4 that Jen picked, and the remaining 2 numbers must come from the 6 numbers that Jen did not pick. So, the number of ways is C(4,2) * C(6,2).

Similarly, for exactly 3 matches:

- Choose 3 numbers from Jen's 4, and the remaining 1 number comes from the 6 she didn't pick. So, C(4,3) * C(6,1).

And for exactly 4 matches, it's just 1 way, as discussed earlier.

So, the total number of favorable outcomes for B is:

C(4,2)*C(6,2) + C(4,3)*C(6,1) + C(4,4)*C(6,0).

Let me compute each term:

C(4,2) = 6, C(6,2) = 15. So, 6*15 = 90.

C(4,3) = 4, C(6,1) = 6. So, 4*6 =24.

C(4,4) = 1, C(6,0)=1. So, 1*1=1.

Total favorable outcomes: 90 + 24 +1 = 115.

Therefore, the number of ways to win a prize is 115. But wait, hold on, the total number of possible ways is C(10,4)=210.

So, P(B) = 115 / 210. Simplify that: both divided by 5? 115 ÷5=23, 210 ÷5=42. So, P(B)=23/42.

Wait, but wait a second. Let me double-check the math because 90 +24+1 is 115, and 115/210 should reduce correctly. 115 divided by 5 is 23, yes, and 210 divided by 5 is 42. So, yes, 23/42.

Now, P(A) is 1/210.

Wait, but wait, no, P(A) is 1/210, but when we calculate P(A) / P(B), that's (1/210) divided by (23/42) = (1/210) * (42/23) = (42)/(210*23) = (1)/(5*23) = 1/115.

Wait, that can't be right because 1/210 divided by 23/42 is (1/210) * (42/23) = (42)/(210*23) = (1)/(5*23) = 1/115.

Wait, but 42 divided by 210 is 1/5. So, 42/210=1/5, which multiplied by 1/23 is 1/(5*23) = 1/11
