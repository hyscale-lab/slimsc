Okay, so I've got this problem here, and I need to figure out where the point C is on segment AB such that it's the only point on AB that isn't covered by any other segment from the family F. The family F consists of all segments PQ of unit length in the first quadrant, with P on the x-axis and Q on the y-axis. 

First, let me visualize the setup. Points O, A, and B form a triangle. O is at (0,0), A is at (1/2, 0), and B is at (0, sqrt(3)/2). So, A is halfway along the x-axis from O to (1,0), and B is somewhere along the y-axis, about 0.866 units up.

Segment AB connects these two points. I might want to find the equation of AB to see where point C lies. Let me calculate that.

The coordinates of A are (1/2, 0) and B are (0, sqrt(3)/2). The slope of AB is (sqrt(3)/2 - 0)/(0 - 1/2) = (sqrt(3)/2)/(-1/2) = -sqrt(3). So the equation of AB is y = -sqrt(3)x + sqrt(3)/2. Wait, let me check that. When x = 0, y should be sqrt(3)/2, which it is. When x = 1/2, y should be 0: y = -sqrt(3)*(1/2) + sqrt(3)/2 = -sqrt(3)/2 + sqrt(3)/2 = 0. Yep, that's correct.

So any point C on AB can be parametrized. Maybe I can write it in terms of a parameter t, where t ranges from 0 to 1. Let's say point C = ( (1/2)(1 - t), (sqrt(3)/2) t ). When t=0, it's at A, and t=1, it's at B. So for 0 < t < 1, C is somewhere between A and B.

Now, the family F consists of segments PQ of length 1, with P on the x-axis and Q on the y-axis. So each such segment PQ connects a point P(p,0) to Q(0,q) such that the distance between them is 1. The distance formula gives sqrt(p^2 + q^2) = 1, so p^2 + q^2 = 1.

So for each p in [0,1], there's a corresponding q = sqrt(1 - p^2). But since we're in the first quadrant, p and q are positive.

Each segment PQ can be represented as the line connecting (p,0) to (0,q). The equation of this line can be found using the two-point form.

The slope of PQ is (q - 0)/(0 - p) = -q/p. So the equation is y = (-q/p)x + q.

So any point on PQ satisfies y = (-sqrt(1 - p^2)/p) x + sqrt(1 - p^2).

Now, the point C is on AB and also on some PQ from F, but it's unique in the sense that no other PQ from F passes through it. So we need to find C such that it's the only intersection point between AB and all such PQs.

Wait, no. The problem says C is on AB, and it's the unique point that doesn't belong to any other segment from F besides AB. So for all other PQ in F, C is not on PQ. So C is only on AB and none of the other PQs.

Therefore, we need to find a point C on AB where the only PQ from F that contains C is AB itself. So, if I can find such a point, that's our C.

But how? Maybe I should consider the envelope of all these segments PQ. The envelope would be the curve that is tangent to all these segments. Points on AB that lie on the envelope would only be touched by one PQ each, which is AB itself perhaps.

Alternatively, perhaps I can parametrize the point C on AB and find when it's only on AB and not on any other PQ.

Let me proceed step by step.

Let me parametrize point C as I did before: C = ( (1/2)(1 - t), (sqrt(3)/2) t ), where t is between 0 and 1.

If C lies on some PQ from F, then it must satisfy the equation of PQ: y = (-sqrt(1 - p^
