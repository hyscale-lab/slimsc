Okay, so I have this math problem here: Let ω ≠ 1 be a 13th root of unity. I need to find the remainder when the product from k=0 to 12 of (2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k}) is divided by 1000. Hmm, that sounds a bit complicated, but let me try to break it down.

First, I remember that roots of unity have some nice properties, especially cyclotomic polynomials. Since ω is a primitive 13th root of unity, it satisfies ω^13 = 1, and the minimal polynomial over the integers is the 13th cyclotomic polynomial, which is Φ₁₃(x) = x¹² + x¹¹ + ... + x + 1. But I'm not sure how that directly helps yet.

The product I'm supposed to compute is ∏_{k=0}^{12} (2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k}). Let me see if I can simplify that expression inside the product.

Looking at each term: 2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k}. Maybe I can factor this or express it in a different way. Let me try to rearrange the terms:

= 2(1 - ω^k) + ω^{2k}

Hmm, not sure if that helps. Alternatively, factor out ω^k:

= 2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k} = 2(1 - ω^k) + (ω^k)^2

Wait, maybe I can think of this as a quadratic in ω^k. Let me let ζ = ω^k. Then each term becomes 2 - 2ζ + ζ².

So, 2 - 2ζ + ζ². Let me write that as ζ² - 2ζ + 2. Maybe I can factor this quadratic. The discriminant is b² - 4ac = 4 - 8 = -4, which is negative, so it doesn't factor over the reals. Hmm, but maybe over complex numbers?

Alternatively, perhaps I can find a polynomial whose roots are ζ = ω^k, so that the product over (ζ² - 2ζ + 2) would relate to evaluating some polynomial at specific points. Since ω is a primitive 13th root, ζ runs through all the 13th roots of unity except ζ=1 (since k=0 gives ζ=1, but wait, when k=0, ζ=ω^0=1, so that term is 2 - 2(1) + 1 = 2 - 2 + 1 = 1. So for k=0, the term is 1. For k=1 to 12, ζ = ω, ω², ..., ω¹², which are all the other 12 roots.

So the product is (1) * ∏_{k=1}^{12} (ζ² - 2ζ + 2). So the total product is the product over all ζ ≠ 1 of (ζ² - 2ζ + 2).

Wait a second, I think I can relate this product to evaluating a certain polynomial at specific points. Let me think: If I have a polynomial P(x) = (x² - 2x + 2), and I evaluate it at all the 13th roots of unity except x=1, then the product of P(ζ) over all ζ ≠ 1 is equal to the product over ζ of P(ζ) divided by P(1). But the product over all ζ of P(ζ) is equal to the resultant of P(x) and the minimal polynomial of ζ, which is Φ₁₃(x). Or perhaps, more simply, since Φ₁₃(x) is the minimal polynomial, then the product of P(ζ) for
