Okay, so I need to solve this probability problem about Jen entering a lottery. Let me try to understand the problem step by step.

First, Jen picks 4 distinct numbers from the set S = {1,2,3,...,10}. Then, 4 numbers are randomly chosen from S as well. She wins a prize if at least two of her numbers match the randomly chosen numbers. She wins the grand prize if all four of her numbers match the chosen ones.

The question is about finding the probability that she wins the grand prize given that she won a prize. This is a conditional probability problem. So, I remember that conditional probability is defined as P(A|B) = P(A âˆ© B) / P(B), which in this case would be the probability of winning the grand prize given that she won a prize.

Let me denote A as the event that she wins the grand prize, and B as the event that she wins a prize. So, I need to find P(A|B) = P(A and B) / P(B). But since A is a subset of B (if she wins the grand prize, she definitely wins a prize), then P(A and B) is just P(A). So, P(A|B) = P(A) / P(B).

So, first, I need to compute P(A) which is the probability that all four of her numbers are chosen. Then, I need to compute P(B), the probability that at least two of her numbers are chosen. Then, P(A|B) is just P(A)/P(B).

Let me compute these probabilities.

First, the total number of ways to choose 4 numbers from 10 is C(10,4). C(n,k) is the combination formula n!/(k!(n-k)!)). So, C(10,4) = 210.

Now, for event A: Jen wins the grand prize. That means all 4 numbers she picked are the same as the 4 chosen. Since she picks 4 specific numbers, there's only one favorable outcome for this. So, P(A) = 1 / C(10,4) = 1/210.

Next, event B: She wins a prize, meaning at least two of her numbers are chosen. So, this can happen in a few ways: exactly 2, exactly 3, or exactly 4 numbers match. Since she can't win a prize for exactly 1 or 0 matches, those cases are excluded.

So, the number of favorable outcomes for B is the sum of the number of ways she can have exactly 2 matches, exactly 3 matches, and exactly 4 matches.

Let me compute each term.

Exactly 2 matches: The number of ways to choose 2 correct numbers out of her 4, and 2 incorrect numbers from the remaining 6. So, that's C(4,2)*C(6,2).

Similarly, exactly 3 matches: C(4,3)*C(6,1).

Exactly 4 matches: C(4,4)*C(6,0) = 1.

Wait a second, let me verify that. So, for exactly k matches, it's C(4,k) * C(6, 4 - k). Because she has to choose k correct numbers from her 4, and the remaining (4 - k) incorrect numbers from the 6 she didn't pick.

Wait, no. Wait, the total number of numbers chosen is 4. So, if she has k correct numbers, then the remaining (4 - k) numbers must be incorrect, i.e., from the 6 numbers she didn't choose. So, yeah, the formula is correct.

So, for exactly 2 matches: C(4,2)*C(6,2) = 6 * 15 = 90.

Exactly 3 matches: C(4,3)*C(6,1) = 4 * 6 = 24.

Exactly 4 matches: C(4,4)*C(6,0) = 1 * 1 = 1.

So, total number of favorable outcomes for B is 90 + 24 + 1 = 115.

Therefore, P(B) = 115 / 210.

Wait, let me check: 90 + 24 is 114, plus 1 is 115. Yeah.

So, now, P(A) is 1/210, and P(B) is 115/210.

Therefore, P(A|B) = (1/210) / (115/210) = 1/115.

So, the probability is 1/115. Are 1 and 115 coprime? Well, 115 factors into 5 * 23. 1 shares no common factors with 115 except 1, so yes, it is reduced. So, m=1 and n=115. Then, m + n is 1 + 115 = 116.

Wait, hold on. Let me double-check my calculations because sometimes in these probability problems, it's easy to make a mistake in counting the favorable cases.

So, the total number of ways to choose 4 numbers is 210, correct.

For event A, only one way, correct.

For event B, the number of favorable cases is the sum of exactly 2, 3, and 4 correct matches.

Exactly 2: C(4,2)*C(6,2). Let me compute C(4,2)=6. C(6,2)=15. So, 6*15=90.

Exactly 3: C(4,3)=4. C(6,1)=6. So, 4*6=24.

Exactly 4: 1, as before.

Adding these gives 90+24+1=115, which is correct. So, P(B)=115/210.

So, the conditional probability is 1/115.

Wait, that seems too straightforward. Let me think again.

Alternatively, maybe I should model it using hypergeometric distribution.

Wait, hypergeometric distribution models the probability of k successes (in this case, correct numbers) in n draws without replacement. So, the probability of exactly k correct numbers is:

P(k) = [C(4, k) * C(6
