Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the greatest real number that is less than BD² for all such rhombi. The rhombus ABCD is on the hyperbola x²/20 - y²/24 = 1, and its diagonals intersect at the origin. Hmm.

First, I recall that in a rhombus, the diagonals bisect each other at right angles. Since the intersection is at the origin, the diagonals are the lines connecting the points A, C and B, D. So, the diagonals AC and BD intersect at the origin.

But wait, in a rhombus, the diagonals are perpendicular. So, the slopes of AC and BD should be negative reciprocals of each other if they are not vertical or horizontal.

Each point A, B, C, D lies on the hyperbola. So, their coordinates satisfy x²/20 - y²/24 = 1.

Since the diagonals intersect at the origin, the points are in pairs: A and C are opposite each other across the origin, and similarly for B and D. So, if A is (x, y), then C is (-x, -y), right? Similarly, if B is (p, q), then D is (-p, -q).

But wait, in a rhombus, all sides are equal. So, the distance from A to B should be equal to B to C, etc. Alternatively, since the sides are equal and diagonals bisect each other at right angles, maybe I can use properties of vectors here.

Another thought: the diagonals of a rhombus are perpendicular and bisect each other. So, if I can express the coordinates of the points in terms of vectors, maybe I can find the conditions for the rhombus.

Let me try to model this. Let’s denote vector OA as (a, b) and vector OB as (c, d). Then, since the diagonals bisect each other at the origin, the other points would be C = (-a, -b) and D = (-c, -d). So, the four points are (a, b), (c, d), (-a, -b), (-c, -d).

Now, since ABCD is a rhombus, all sides must be equal. So, the distance between A and B should equal the distance between B and C, and so on.
