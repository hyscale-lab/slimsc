Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this game problem where Alice and Bob take turns removing either 1 or 4 tokens from a stack. The person who takes the last token wins. The question is asking how many positive integers n â‰¤ 2024 allow Bob to have a winning strategy, no matter how Alice plays.

Hmm, let's start by understanding the game mechanics. It's a turn-based game where each player can remove 1 or 4 tokens on their turn. The key here is to determine for each n whether the starting player (Alice) can force a win, or if the second player (Bob) can do so.

I remember that in such games, positions can be classified as either winning or losing positions. A winning position is one where the current player can force a win regardless of what the opponent does. A losing position is the opposite; no matter what the current player does, the opponent can force a win.

So, the first step is to find a pattern or formula that determines whether a given n is a winning or losing position. Let's try to list out the positions for small n and see if a pattern emerges.

Let's consider n=1: Alice takes the last token and wins. So n=1 is a winning position for Alice.

n=2: Alice can take 1 token, leaving 1 for Bob, who then takes it and wins. Alternatively, Alice can't take 4 because it's more than 2. So Alice can only take 1, leaving n=1 for Bob, who then wins. So n=2 is a losing position for Alice, meaning it's a winning position for Bob.

Wait, no, wait. Wait, if n=2 is a losing position for the current player, then if Alice is the current player, she can't win, so Bob can win. So n=2 is a losing position for the current player, which is Alice in this case. So Bob can win. So n=2 is a losing position for the current player, meaning it's a winning position for Bob.

Wait, perhaps I should formalize it. Let me try to list the positions:

n | outcome (current player's turn)
0 | losing (no moves can be made)
1 | winning (take 1)
2 | ?
3 | ?
4 | winning (take 4)
5 | ?

Wait, maybe I should go step by step.

n=0: Well, this is a losing position because there
