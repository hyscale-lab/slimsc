Okay, so I have this problem where Alice and Bob are playing a game with a stack of n tokens. They take turns removing either 1 or 4 tokens. Alice goes first, and whoever takes the last token wins. I need to find how many positive integers n ≤ 2024 allow Bob to have a winning strategy, no matter how Alice plays.

Hmm, let me think about how to approach this. It seems like a combinatorial game theory problem. Maybe I can model the game states as winning or losing positions. A winning position means the current player can force a win, and a losing position means no matter what the current player does, the opponent can force a win.

Since Alice goes first, if the starting number of tokens n is a losing position for Alice, then Bob can win. So, I need to find all n ≤ 2024 where n is a losing position for the first player (Alice), meaning Bob can win.

Let me start by trying to list the positions for small n and see if I can find a pattern.

Let's denote:
- P(n) = True if the current player can force a win with n tokens.
- P(n) = False if the current player cannot force a win, meaning the position is losing.

Base cases:
- P(0) = False (no tokens left, can't move, so the previous player won)
- P(1) = True (current player takes 1 token and wins)
- P(2) = True (current player takes 1, leaving 1 for opponent who takes it and wins? Wait, no. Wait, if current player takes 1, opponent is left with 1 and can win. Alternatively, can current player take 4? No, because there are only 2 tokens. So current player can only take 1. Then the opponent takes the remaining 1 and wins. So P(2) = False? Because whatever the current player does, the opponent can win.

Wait, maybe I need to think again.

Wait, if P(n) is True, that means the current player can win. So for n=0, it's a losing position for the player who has to move. So P(0) = False.

For n=1: the current player takes 1 and wins. So P(1) = True.

n=2: current player can take 1, leaving 1 for the opponent, who then takes it and wins. So if current player takes 1, opponent can win. Or, can current player take 4? No, because n=2. So current player has no winning move. So P(2) = False.

n=3: current player can take 1, leaving 2 for opponent. Since P(2) is False, opponent is in a losing position. So current player can force a win by taking 1. So P(3) = True.

n=4: current player can take 4 and win immediately. So P(4) = True.

n=5: current player can take 1, leaving 4. Since P(4) is True, opponent can win. Or take 4, leaving 1. Since P(1) is True, opponent can win. So all moves lead to opponent winning. So P(5) = False.

n=6: current player can take 1, leaving 5 which is a losing position for opponent. So P(6) = True.

n=7: current player can take 1, leaving 6 which is a winning position for opponent. Or take 4, leaving 3 which is a winning position for opponent. So both moves lead to opponent winning. So P(7) = False? Wait, no. Let me check.

Wait, n=7: if current player takes 1, leaving 6. Since P(6)=True, opponent can win. If current player takes 4, leaving 3. P(3)=True, opponent can win. So yes, both options lead to opponent winning. So P(7) = False.

n=8: current player can take 1, leaving 7 which is a losing position for the opponent. So P(8)=True.

n=9: current player can take 1, leaving 8 which is a winning position for opponent. Or take 4, leaving 5 which is a losing position for opponent. So if current player takes 4, opponent is left with 5, a losing position. So P(9)=True.

Wait, so n=9 is a winning position because the player can take 4, leaving opponent at 5 (losing). So P(9)=True.

Wait a second, let me correct that. For n=9, the player can take 4, leaving 5, which is a losing position. So yes, P(9) is True.

n=10: current player can take 1, leaving 9 (which is a winning position for opponent), or take 4, leaving 6 (which is a winning position for opponent). So both moves lead to opponent being able to win. So P(10)=False.

Wait, so let me make a table:

n | P(n)
0 | F
1 | T
2 | F
3 | T
4 | T
5 | F
6 | T
7 | F
8 | T
9 | T
10| F

Hmm, looking at this, maybe the losing positions are n=0,2,5,7,10,...

Looking for a pattern: Let's see the differences between the losing positions.

0,2,5,7,10. The differences between consecutive terms are 2,3,2,3. Hmm, perhaps a repeating pattern of adding 2 and 3 alternately?

So, starting from 0:

0 +2 =2

2 +3=5

5+2=7

7+3=10

10+2=12

12+3=15

15+2=17

17+3=20

20+2=22

22+3=25

and so on.

So the losing positions are numbers congruent to 0,2,5,7,10,12,15,17,20,22,25,... modulo something.

Wait, let me see if I can find a modulo pattern here. Let me compute these numbers modulo 5.

0 mod5=0

2 mod5=2

5 mod5=0

7 mod5=2

10 mod5=0

12 mod5=2

15 mod5=0

17 mod5=2

20 mod5=0

22 mod5=2

25 mod5=0

Hmm, so the losing positions are numbers congruent to 0 or 2 modulo 5.

Wait, let's check:

n=0: 0 mod5=0 → losing

n=2: 2 mod5=2 → losing

n=5: 0 mod5=0 → losing

n=7: 2 mod5=2 → losing

n=10: 0 mod5=0 → losing

n=12: 2 mod5=2 → losing

n=15: 0 mod5=0 → losing

Yes, that seems to fit.

Wait, let me confirm with n=7,12,17, etc.

So the losing positions are numbers where n ≡ 0 or 2 mod5.

Therefore, for n ≥0, if n mod5 is 0 or 2, then it's a losing position. Else, it's a winning position.

So, if the starting position is a losing position, then the second player can win. So Bob can win if n is a losing position.

So, in our case, Bob can win when n ≡0 or 2 mod5.

Wait, but wait: in the initial analysis, for n=5, which is 0 mod5, P(5)=False → so Alice can't win if n=5, so Bob can.

Similarly, n=2 is 2 mod5, which is a losing position for Alice, so Bob can win.

So, the losing positions are n ≡0 or 2 mod5.

So, the question is, how many numbers n ≤2024 are ≡0 or 2 mod5.

So, we need to count the numbers ≤2024 where n mod5=0 or 2.

Let me compute how many numbers ≤2024 are ≡0 mod5.

Numbers: 0,5,10,...,2020 (since 2020 is 5*404=2020). So the count is floor(2024/5) +1 if 2024 is included.

Wait, 2024 divided by 5 is 404.8, so floor(2024/5)=404. So the numbers 5*0,5*1,...,5*404=2020. So count is 405.

Similarly, numbers ≡2 mod5. They are 2,7,12,..., up to the maximum less than or equal to 2024.

What's the maximum number ≤2024 that is ≡2 mod5?

Let me compute 2024 mod5: 2024 /5=404*5=2020, 2024-2020=4. So 2024 mod5=4.

So the last number ≡2 mod5 ≤2024 is 2022 (since 2022=5*404 +2=2020+2=2022).

So, the sequence is 2,7,12,...,2022.

This is an arithmetic sequence with first term 2, common difference 5.

The number of terms is given by ((last term - first term)/common difference) +1.

So, ((2022 -2)/5)+1 = (2020/5)+1= 404 +1=405.

So, numbers ≡2 mod5: 405 numbers.

Similarly, numbers ≡0 mod5: 405 numbers.

Wait, but wait: 2024 is not included in either, but our counting up to 2022 for ≡2 mod5, and 2020 for ≡0 mod5.

So total numbers that are losing positions are 405 (for 0 mod5) +405 (for 2 mod5)=810.

But wait, let's check if any number is counted in both. Since 0 mod5 and 2 mod5 are distinct, no overlap. So 405+405=810.

Wait, but wait a second: for n=0, it's a losing position, but n=0 is not a positive integer. The problem says "positive integers n ≤2024", so n starts at 1.

So, for n=0, it's not counted. Therefore, in our previous counting, for n≡0 mod5:

Numbers are 5,10,...,2020. So how many terms?

The first term is 5, which is 5*1, and the last term is 5*404=2020.

So the count is 404 numbers.

Similarly, for n≡2 mod5, numbers are 2,7,12,...,2022.

The first term is 2, which is 5*0 +2, and the last term is 2022=5*404 +2.

So the count is 405 numbers.

Wait, because when you have terms starting at 5k+2, for k=0 to 404, that's 405 terms.

Similarly, for n≡0 mod5, starting at 5*1=5 to 5*404=2020: that's 404 terms.

So total losing positions for n≥1 are 404 +405=809.

Wait, let me make sure.

Wait, the numbers ≡0 mod5 from 1 to 2024: first is 5, last is 2020. Number of terms: (2020 -5)/5 +1= (2015)/5 +1=403 +1=404.

Numbers ≡2 mod5 from 1 to 2024: first is 2, last is 2022. Number of terms: (2022 -2)/5 +1=2020/5 +1=404 +1=405.

So total is 404 +405=809.

Thus, the answer is 809.

But wait, let me double-check my counting.

For n≡0 mod5:

Numbers: 5,10,...,2020.

Number of terms: (2020)/5=404.

But since we start at 5, which is 5*1, the number of terms is 404.

Similarly, for n≡2 mod5:

Numbers:2,7,...,2022.

Number of terms: (2022-2)/5 +1=2020/5 +1=404 +1=405.

So 404+405=809.

But earlier, when I thought about mod5, I thought all n≡0 or 2 mod5 are losing positions, but starting from n=1.

Wait, let's check n=2: yes, it's losing. n=5: losing. n=7: losing. n=10: losing. So correct.

So the total numbers are 809.

So, the number of n ≤2024 where Bob can force a win is 809.

Wait, but wait another thing. Let me confirm with n=10.

n=10 is a losing position, so Bob can win if n=10.

n=11: current player can take 1, leaving 10 (losing for opponent), so P(11)=True.

n=12: current player can take 1, leaving 11 (which is a winning position for opponent). Or take 4, leaving 8. P(8)=True. So both options leave opponent in a winning position. So P(12)=False.

Wait, so n=12 is a losing position, which is 12 mod5=2. So yes, it fits.

Wait, but earlier, I thought the losing positions were 0 and 2 mod5, but n=5 is 0 mod5, and n=2 is 2 mod5, etc.

So seems consistent.

So, the answer is 809.


To determine the number of positive integers \( n \leq 2024 \) for which Bob can guarantee a win, we analyze the game as a combinatorial game where players take turns removing 1 or 4 tokens. The key is to identify the losing positions where the current player cannot force a win.

We denote \( P(n) \) as a winning position if the current player can force a win with \( n \) tokens, and losing otherwise. By examining small values of \( n \), we observe a pattern in the losing positions. These positions correspond to \( n \equiv 0 \) or \( 2 \pmod{5} \).

To count the number of such \( n \) up to 2024:
1. **For \( n \equiv 0 \pmod{5} \):** The numbers are 5, 10, ..., 2020. There are \( \left\lfloor \frac{2020}{5} \right\rfloor = 404 \) terms.
2. **For \( n \equiv 2 \pmod{5} \):** The numbers are 2, 7, ..., 2022. There are \( \left\lfloor \frac{2022 - 2}{5} \right\rfloor + 1 = 405 \) terms.

Adding these, we find there are \( 404 + 405 = 809 \) losing positions where Bob can guarantee a win.

The final answer is \(\boxed{809}\).
