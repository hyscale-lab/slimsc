Okay, so I have this probability problem to solve, and I want to make sure I understand it correctly before diving in. Let me read it again and break it down.

Jen is entering a lottery. She picks 4 distinct numbers from the set S, which is {1,2,3,...,9,10}. Then, 4 numbers are randomly chosen from S. She wins a prize if at least two of her numbers match two of the randomly chosen numbers. She wins the grand prize if all four of her numbers match the four randomly chosen numbers. The question is about the probability of her winning the grand prize given that she won a prize. They express this probability as a fraction m/n, where m and n are coprime, and we need to find m + n.

Alright, so this is a conditional probability problem. The formula for conditional probability is P(A|B) = P(A ∩ B) / P(B), where A is the event of winning the grand prize, and B is the event of winning a prize. Since winning the grand prize means she has all four numbers correct, which also means she definitely has at least two correct, so A is a subset of B. That means P(A ∩ B) is just P(A). So, the probability we need is P(A)/P(B).

So, first, let's figure out what P(A) is. That's the probability that all four of her numbers are chosen. Since the lottery is picking 4 numbers out of 10, the total number of possible combinations is C(10,4). The number of favorable outcomes for the grand prize is just 1, because there's only one set of four numbers that Jen could have picked. So, P(A) = 1 / C(10,4).

Let me compute C(10,4). That's 10! / (4! * (10-4)!) = (10*9*8*7)/(4*3*2*1) = 210. So, P(A) = 1/210.

Next, I need to find P(B), the probability that Jen wins at least two numbers. That means she has exactly 2, exactly 3, or exactly 4 numbers matching. So, we need to compute the probability of each of these events and sum them up.

Alternatively, since sometimes it's easier to compute the complement, but in this case, since we're dealing with conditional probability, maybe computing it directly is better.

Let me think about how to compute the number of favorable outcomes for B. So, B is the event that at least two of Jen's numbers are among the four chosen. So, the number of favorable outcomes is the sum of the number of ways to choose 2, 3, or 4 numbers from Jen's 4, and the remaining numbers from the other 6 numbers not chosen by Jen.

Wait, that makes sense. So, the total number of favorable cases is C(4,2)*C(6,2) + C(4,3)*C(6,1) + C(4,4)*C(6,0).

Let me compute each term:

- C(4,2) is the number of ways to choose 2 correct numbers from Jen's 4, and then choose the remaining 2 numbers from the 6 she didn't pick. So, C(4,2) = 6, and C(6,2) = 15. So, 6*15=90.

- C(4,3) is 4, and C(6,1) is 6. So, 4*6=24.

- C(4,4) is 1, and C(6,0) is 1. So, 1*1=1.

Adding these up: 90 + 24 + 1 = 115.

So, the number of favorable outcomes for B is 115.

Therefore, P(B) = 115 / 210.

Wait, let me confirm that. So, total possible combinations are C(10,4)=210. So, P(B) is 115/210.

But let me think again if this is correct. So, the number of ways where exactly 2,3,4 numbers match.

Yes, that seems right. So, 115 is the number of favorable for B, and 210 is the total.

But wait, hold on a second. Let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in adding. 90 +24 is 114, plus 1 is 115. Yes.

So, P(B)=115/210.

So, now, going back to the conditional probability, P
