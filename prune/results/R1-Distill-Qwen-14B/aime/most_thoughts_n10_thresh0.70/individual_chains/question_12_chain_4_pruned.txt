Okay, so I have this problem where I need to fill a 2x3 grid with digits. Each cell will have a single digit. The conditions are that when I read the numbers left to right in each row, their sum should be 999. Also, when I read the numbers top to bottom in each column, their sum should be 99. The grid is 2 rows by 3 columns, so the first row will form a two-digit number, the second row another two-digit number, and each column will form a two-digit number as well. Wait, no, hold on. Wait, no, 2x3 grid: two rows, three columns. So each row has three digits, meaning each row is a three-digit number. Each column has two digits, so each column is a two-digit number. Wait, but the example given in the problem shows a grid with 0,0,8 on top and 9,9,1 below. So the two numbers are 008 and 991. Their sum is 008 + 991 = 999. Then, reading top to bottom, each column is 09, 09, 81. Wait, 09 is 9, 09 is 9, 81 is 81. So 9 + 9 + 81 = 99. So that's how the example works. 

So the rows are three-digit numbers, and the columns are two-digit numbers. So in general, for each row, it's a three-digit number, so the first row is ABC, the second row is DEF, where each letter represents a digit. Then the sum of ABC + DEF = 999. The columns are AD, BE, CF, each of which is a two-digit number, and their sum is 99. 

So, the problem is to find the number of possible ways to assign digits to A, B, C, D, E, F such that:

1. ABC + DEF = 999
2. AD + BE + CF = 99

Where each of A, B, C, D, E, F is a digit from 0 to 9, except that A and D can't be zero if we're considering the numbers as three-digit and two-digit numbers. Wait, but in the example, the first row is 008, which is a three-digit number, but leading zeros are allowed because it's written as 008. Similarly, the columns have 09, 09, 81, which are two-digit numbers, but 09 is allowed since they are just two-digit numbers. So leading zeros are allowed for both the rows and the columns. That's important because it affects the possible digits for A and D.

So, in the first row, A can be zero. Similarly, in the columns, the first digit (like D in AD) can be zero. So all digits A to F can be from 0 to 9.

So, we need to model this
