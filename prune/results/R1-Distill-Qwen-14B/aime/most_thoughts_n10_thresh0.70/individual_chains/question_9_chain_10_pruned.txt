Okay, so I have this problem here: there are real numbers x and y, both greater than 1, such that log base x of y to the x equals 10, and log base y of x to the 4y also equals 10. I need to find the product xy. Hmm, okay, let me try to unpack this step by step.

First, I know that logarithms can be tricky, but I remember some basic properties that might help. Specifically, log_b(a^c) = c * log_b(a). So maybe I can use that to simplify these expressions.

Looking at the first equation: log_x(y^x) = 10. Applying that property, this becomes x * log_x(y) = 10. Wait, that simplifies further because log_x(y) is just the exponent you need to raise x to get y. Let me denote log_x(y) as some variable, maybe k. So, if log_x(y) = k, then x^k = y. That might be useful.

So substituting back into the first equation: x * k = 10. So, xk =10. If I can find another equation involving k, maybe I can solve for x and y.

Now, let's look at the second equation: log_y(x^{4y}) =10. Similarly, applying the same log property, this becomes 4y * log_y(x) =10. Hmm, okay, so 4y * log_y(x) =10.

But wait, log_y(x) is related to log_x(y). I remember that log_b(a) = 1 / log_a(b). So, log_y(x) = 1 / log_x(y) = 1/k. So substituting that into the second equation: 4y * (1/k) =10. So, (4y)/k =10.

So now I have two equations:

1. xk =10
2. (4y)/k =10

Hmm, I can perhaps solve these two equations together. Let me see.

From the first equation, xk=10, so x =10/k.

From the second equation, (4y)/k=10. Multiply both sides by k: 4y=10k. Then y= (10k)/4 = (5k)/2.

So now, I have expressions for x and y in terms of k. Let me write that:

x =10/k

y= (5k)/2

But earlier, I defined k as log_x(y), which is log_x(y)=k. And since x=10/k and y=(5k)/2, I can substitute these into the expression for k.

Wait, so k = log_x(y) = log_{10/k} (5k/2). Hmm, that's a bit complicated, but maybe I can use the change of base formula. Remember that log_b(a) = ln(a)/ln(b), right?

So, k = ln(y)/ln(x) = ln(5k/2) / ln(10/k).

Hmm, that's a
