Okay, so I've got this problem here, and I need to find the number of triples of nonnegative integers (a, b, c) that satisfy two conditions: a + b + c = 300 and a²b + a²c + b²a + b²c + c²a + c²b = 6,000,000. Hmm, that looks a bit complicated, but let me try to break it down.

First, the equation a + b + c = 300 is straightforward. It means the sum of the three numbers is 300. The second equation, though, is more complex. It has terms like a²b, a²c, and so on. Maybe I can factor or rearrange it somehow to make it more manageable.

Looking at the second equation, I notice that each term is a product of a square of one variable and another variable. For example, a²b and a²c have a² multiplied by b and c respectively. Similarly, b²a and b²c have b² multiplied by a and c, and so on for the c terms. So, the equation can be rewritten as a²(b + c) + b²(a + c) + c²(a + b) = 6,000,000.

Wait, that might be helpful. Since a + b + c = 300, then b + c = 300 - a, a + c = 300 - b, and a + b = 300 - c. So, substituting these into the equation, we get:

a²(300 - a) + b²(300 - b) + c²(300 - c) = 6,000,000.

Hmm, that's an interesting form. Let me write that down:

a²(300 - a) + b²(300 - b) + c²(300 - c) = 6,000,000.

Now, I need to find all nonnegative integer triples (a, b, c) such that this equation holds along with a + b + c = 300.

I wonder if there's a way to relate these two equations. Maybe if I express some variables in terms of others. But since all three variables are symmetric in the equation, perhaps assuming some order might help. For example, assume that a ≤ b ≤ c or something like that. But I'm not sure if that will help me directly.

Alternatively, maybe I can consider that the second equation can be related to the first. Let's see. Let me think about the expression a²(300 - a). If I expand it, that's 300a² - a³. Similarly, for b and c. So the entire equation becomes:

300a² - a³ + 300b² - b³ + 300c² - c³ = 6,000,000.

I can factor out the 300:

300(a² + b² + c²) - (a³ + b³ + c³) = 6,000,000.

Dividing both sides by 300:

a² + b² + c² - (a³ + b³ + c³)/300 = 20,000.

Hmm, that seems a bit messy. Maybe not the best approach.

Wait, another thought: since a + b + c = 300, I can express a² + b² + c² in terms of (a + b + c)². Specifically, (a + b + c)² = a² + b² + c² + 2(ab + bc + ac). So, a² + b² + c² = (300)² -
