Okay, so I'm trying to solve this problem where I need to find the remainder when the product \(\prod_{k=0}^{12}(2 - 2\omega^k + \omega^{2k})\) is divided by 1000. Here, \(\omega\) is a 13th root of unity and it's not equal to 1. Hmm, 13th roots of unity, okay, so that means \(\omega^{13} = 1\), right?

First, I should remember what roots of unity are. They are complex numbers that satisfy the equation \(x^n = 1\), where n is the order. In this case, n is 13, so \(\omega^k\) for k from 0 to 12 will all be the roots of the equation \(x^{13} - 1 = 0\). Since \(\omega \neq 1\), we're considering all the primitive 13th roots and their powers.

The expression I need to compute is a product from k=0 to 12 of (2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k}). That's a lot of terms multiplied together. I wonder if there's a way to simplify this product instead of computing each term individually, because that would take forever, especially with k going up to 12.

Let me write out the terms to see if I can spot a pattern or some symmetry. Let's denote each term in the product as:

\(f(k) = 2 - 2\omega^k + \omega^{2k}\)

So the product is \(\prod_{k=0}^{12} f(k)\).

Hmm, maybe I can express each term f(k) in terms of \(\omega^k\). Let me see:

\(f(k) = 2 - 2\omega^k + \omega^{2k}\)

Wait, that looks like a quadratic in terms of \(\omega^k\). Let me set \(x = \omega^k\), then:

\(f(k) = 2 - 2x + x^2 = x^2 - 2x + 2\)

So, \(f(k) = x^2 - 2x + 2\), where \(x = \omega^k\). That might be helpful.

So the product becomes \(\prod_{k=0}^{12} (x^2 - 2x + 2)\) where \(x = \omega^k\).

But wait, each x is a 13th root of unity, right? Because \(\omega\) is a primitive 13th root, so \(\omega^k\) for k=0 to 12 are all the 13th roots of unity.

So, perhaps the product is over all 13th roots of unity, except when x=1, which is when k=0. So, for k=0, x=1, and f(0) = 1^2 -2*1 + 2 = 1 - 2 + 2 = 1. So the term when k=0 is just 1, which doesn't affect the product. So actually, the product is equal to the product over k=1 to 12 of (x^2 - 2x + 2), where x are the 13th roots of unity except 1.

Alternatively, the entire product is \(\prod_{k=0}^{12} (x^2 - 2x + 2)\), since when k=0, it's 1, which is just 1, so maybe the product can be considered over all roots of x^{13}=1, including x=1, but since x=1 contributes 1, it doesn't change the product. Hmm, maybe that's a way to think about it.

Alternatively, perhaps we can consider the product as evaluating a certain polynomial at specific points. Since the product is over all 13th roots
