Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find a list of positive integers with certain properties, and then calculate the sum of the squares of all the items in the list. Let me try to break down the problem and figure out step by step how to approach it.

First, let me list out the given properties:

1. The sum of the items in the list is 30.
2. The unique mode of the list is 9.
3. The median of the list is a positive integer that does not appear in the list itself.

And the goal is to find the sum of the squares of all the items in the list.

Hmm, okay. So I need to construct such a list and then compute the sum of squares. But maybe there's only one possible list that satisfies all these conditions, or perhaps a few, but I have to find the one that fits.

Let me start by recalling what each term means.

**Mode:** The mode is the number that appears most frequently in the list. Since it's the unique mode, 9 must appear more times than any other number in the list. So, 9 must be the most frequent.

**Median:** The median is the middle number when the list is ordered from smallest to largest. If the list has an odd number of elements, the median is the middle one. If even, it's the average of the two middle numbers. But here, it's given that the median is a positive integer that doesn't appear in the list. So, in the case of an even number of elements, the median would be the average of two middle numbers, which would have to be an integer not present in the list. But wait, the average of two integers is an integer only if both are even or both are odd. Hmm, but wait, the median itself is an integer not in the list. So, for example, if the two middle numbers are 8 and 10, their average would be 9, which is already in the list. So that wouldn't work because 9 is present. So perhaps the median is between two numbers that add up to an odd number, making the average a non-integer. Wait, no, because the median has to be an integer. So that can't be. Wait, maybe the list has an odd number of elements. Let me think.

Wait, if the list has an odd number of elements, say, 2k+1 elements, then the median is the (k+1)th element. That element must be an integer not present in the list. But wait, that's impossible because the list is ordered, so the (k+1)th element is part of the list, right? So if the median is a positive integer not in the list, that suggests that the list has an even number of elements because the median would be the average of two middle numbers, which could be an integer not present in the list.

Wait, let me clarify. If the list has an even number of elements, say 2k, then the median is the average of the kth and (k+1)th elements. For this average to be an integer, the two middle numbers must be either both even or both odd. Let's suppose that the average is an
