Okay, so I have this math problem here, and I'm trying to figure out how to approach it. Let me read it again:

"Let $N$ be the greatest four-digit positive integer with the property that whenever one of its digits is changed to $1$, the resulting number is divisible by $7$. Let $Q$ and $R$ be the quotient and remainder, respectively, when $N$ is divided by $1000$. Find $Q+R$."

Hmm. So, I need to find the largest four-digit number N. The key property is that if any one of its digits is changed to 1, the new number is divisible by 7. Then, once I find N, I have to compute Q + R where N divided by 1000 gives Q as the quotient and R as the remainder.

Let me break this down. First, N is a four-digit number, so it's between 1000 and 9999. I need the largest such number, so I should probably start checking from 9999 downwards until I find a number that satisfies the given condition.

The condition is: changing any one digit to 1 results in a number divisible by 7. So, for each digit in N, if I replace it with 1, the new number must be divisible by 7.

Let me denote N as a four-digit number: N = ABCD, where A, B, C, D are its digits, with A ≠ 0.

So, if I change A to 1, the number becomes 1BCD. Similarly, changing B to 1 gives A1CD, changing C gives AB1D, and changing D gives ABC1. Each of these four numbers must be divisible by 7.

So, 1BCD, A1CD, AB1D, ABC1 are all divisible by 7.

I need to find the largest N where this is true. Then, compute Q + R where N = 1000*Q + R.

Let me think about how to approach this. Since N is the largest possible, maybe it's close to 9999. So, perhaps I can start checking numbers near 9999 and see if they satisfy the condition.

But checking each number one by one might be time-consuming. Maybe I can find some properties or constraints that N must satisfy, which can help narrow down the possibilities.

Let me consider the numbers formed by changing each digit to 1:

1. Changing the thousands digit (A) to 1: 1BCD. So, 1BCD must be divisible by 7.

2. Changing the hundreds digit (B) to 1: A1CD must be divisible by 7.

3. Changing the tens digit (C) to 1: AB1D must be divisible by 7.

4. Changing the units digit (D) to 1: ABC1 must be divisible by 7.

So, each of these numbers must be divisible by 7. Let me write each of them in terms of their numerical values.

1. 1BCD = 1000*1 + 100*B + 10*C + D = 1000 + 100B + 10C + D.

2. A1CD = 1000*A + 100*1 + 10*C + D = 1000A + 100 + 10C + D.

3. AB1D = 1000*A + 100*B + 10*1 + D = 1000A + 100B + 10 + D.

4. ABC1 = 1000*A + 100*B + 10*C + 1.

Each of these must be divisible by 7. So, for each, their modulo 7 should be 0.

Let me denote N = 1000A + 100B + 10C + D.

Then, for each of the four modified numbers, let's express their modulo 7 in terms of N.

Wait, perhaps it's better to write each modified number and set up congruences.

Let me define:

1. M1 = 1000 + 100B + 10C + D. So, M1 ≡ 0 mod7.

2. M2 = 1000A + 100 + 10C + D. So, M2 ≡ 0 mod7.

3. M3 = 1000A + 100B + 10 + D. So, M3 ≡ 0 mod7.

4. M4 = 1000A + 100B + 10C + 1. So, M4 ≡ 0 mod7.

Hmm. Let me compute each of these mod7.

But maybe I can express each of these in terms of N or its digits.

Alternatively, perhaps I can express M1, M2, M3, M4 in terms of N.

Wait, let me see:

M1 is changing A to 1: M1 = 1000 + 100B + 10C + D.

But N = 1000A + 100B + 10C + D.

So, M1 = (1000 + 100B + 10C + D) = 1000*(1) + 100B + 10C + D.

Similarly, M2 = 1000A + 100*(1) + 10C + D.

M3 = 1000A + 100B + 10*(1) + D.

M4 = 1000A + 100B + 10C + 1.

So, perhaps I can write these in terms of N and the original digits.

Wait, let's try to relate each modified number to N.

For M1
