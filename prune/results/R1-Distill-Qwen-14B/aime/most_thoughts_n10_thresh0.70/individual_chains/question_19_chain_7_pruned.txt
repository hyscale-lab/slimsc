Okay, so I have this geometry problem here. Let me read it again: Triangle ABC has circumcenter O and incenter I. It says that IA is perpendicular to OI. The circumradius is 13, and the inradius is 6. I need to find AB multiplied by AC. Hmm, interesting.

Alright, let's start by recalling some concepts. The circumcenter O is the center of the circumscribed circle, and the incenter I is the center of the inscribed circle. IA is perpendicular to OI, which is a line segment connecting the incenter and circumcenter. The circumradius R is given as 13, and the inradius r is 6.

I remember that in any triangle, the distance between the incenter and circumcenter can be found using the formula: OI = sqrt(R(R - 2r)). Let me confirm that. Yes, I think that's correct. So plugging in the values, OI would be sqrt(13*(13 - 12)) = sqrt(13*1) = sqrt(13). Hmm, so OI is sqrt(13).

Now, it's given that IA is perpendicular to OI. So, IA ⊥ OI. Hmm. So, maybe we can use some coordinate geometry here? Or perhaps some properties of vectors? I'm not sure yet.

Wait, maybe we can use vectors. Let me consider the positions of O and I. If IA is perpendicular to OI, then the vector IA is perpendicular to the vector OI. So, their dot product is zero. Let me denote vectors as such: vector IA · vector OI = 0.

But I'm not sure how to directly apply this. Maybe I should think about the triangle's sides and other properties. Let's denote AB = c, BC = a, and AC = b. Wait, actually, by standard notation, AB = c, BC = a, AC = b, so that's opposite to angles A, B, C respectively. Hmm, but maybe I should just assign variables as needed.

I also recall that in a triangle, the distance from the inradius to a vertex can be expressed in terms of the triangle's sides. Wait, but IA is the distance from the inradius to vertex A? No, wait. IA is the length from incenter I to vertex A, which is called the inradius? No, wait, the inradius is the distance from the incenter to any side, not to the vertex.

So, IA is actually the length from the incenter to vertex A. I think there's a formula for that. Let me recall. Yes, the length from the incenter to a vertex can be found using the formula: IA = sqrt(r^2 + (s - a)^2), where s is the semi-perimeter, and a is the side opposite angle A. Wait, but I need to confirm that. Alternatively, another formula might be IA = (r)/sin(A/2). Hmm, yes, that sounds right. Because in the incenter, the angle bisectors meet, and the distance from the incenter to a vertex can be expressed in terms of the angle at that vertex.

So, IA = r / sin(A/2). Similarly, IB = r /
