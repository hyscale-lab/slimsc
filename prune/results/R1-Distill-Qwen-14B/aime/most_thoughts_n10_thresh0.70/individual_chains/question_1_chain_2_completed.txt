Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the value of |log₂(x⁴y³z²)| given a system of logarithmic equations. Hmm, let's see.

First, all variables x, y, z are positive real numbers, which is good because logs are defined for positive numbers. The equations are:

1. log₂(x/(y z)) = 1/2
2. log₂(y/(x z)) = 1/3
3. log₂(z/(x y)) = 1/4

I need to find |log₂(x⁴y³z²)|. Let me try to solve for x, y, z first using the given equations.

I remember that log₂(a/b) = log₂ a - log₂ b. So maybe I can rewrite each equation in terms of log x, log y, log z.

Let me denote:
Let a = log₂ x
Let b = log₂ y
Let c = log₂ z

Then, the equations become:

1. log₂(x/(y z)) = log₂ x - log₂ y - log₂ z = a - b - c = 1/2
2. log₂(y/(x z)) = log₂ y - log₂ x - log₂ z = b - a - c = 1/3
3. log₂(z/(x y)) = log₂ z - log₂ x - log₂ y = c - a - b = 1/4

So now, I have a system of three equations:

1. a - b - c = 1/2  ...(1)
2. -a + b - c = 1/3 ...(2)
3. -a - b + c = 1/4 ...(3)

Hmm, let's write these equations clearly:

Equation (1): a - b - c = 1/2

Equation (2): -a + b - c = 1/3

Equation (3): -a - b + c = 1/4

I need to solve for a, b, c. Let's try to add equations or manipulate them.

If I add equations (1) and (2):

(1)+(2): (a - a) + (-b + b) + (-c - c) = 1/2 + 1/3
Which simplifies to: 0 + 0 - 2c = 5/6 (since 1/2 + 1/3 = 3/6 + 2/6 =5/6)

So, -2c =5/6 → c = -5/(12)

Wait, hold on, c is log₂ z, which is a real number, but negative. Since z is positive, log can be negative. That's okay.

So c = -5/12.

Now, let's plug c into another equation. Let's take equation (1):

a - b - (-5/12) = 1/2 → a - b +5/12 =1/2

So, a - b = 1/2 -5/12 = (6/12 -5/12) =1/12 → a - b =1/12 ...(4)

Similarly, take equation (2):

- a + b - (-5/12) =1/3 → -a + b +5/12 =1/3

So, -a + b =1/3 -5/12 = (4/12 -5/12)= -1/12 → -a + b = -1/12 ...(5)

Now, equations (4) and (5):

(4): a - b =1/12

(5): -a + b = -1/12

If I add (4) and (5):

(a -a) + (-b +b) =1/12 -1/12 → 0=0. Hmm, that's not helpful. Maybe I can solve for a or b.

From (4): a = b +1/12

Plugging into (5):

-(b +1/12) + b = -1/12 → -b -1/12 + b = -1/12 → -1/12 = -1/12. Well, that's an identity, so it doesn't give new info.

So perhaps I need to use equation (3). Let's recall equation (3):

- a - b + c =1/4

We know c is -5/12, so:

- a - b -5/12 =1/4 → -a -b =1/4 +5/12 = 3/12 +5/12=8/12=2/3

So, -a - b =2/3 → a + b= -2/3 ...(6)

But from equation (4): a = b +1/12. Plugging into equation (6):

(b +1/12) + b = -2/3 → 2b +1/12 = -2/3

Subtract 1/12: 2b = -2/3 -1/12 = (-8/12 -1/12)= -9/12= -3/4

So, 2b = -3/4 → b= -3/8

Then from equation (4): a = b +1/12= (-3/8) +1/12

Convert to common denominator, which is 24:

-3/8 = -9/24, and 1/12=2/24. So a= (-9/24 +2/24)= (-7)/24

So a = -7/24, b= -3/8, c= -5/12.

So, let me recap:

a = log₂ x = -7/24 → x=2^(-7/24)

b = log₂ y = -3/8 → y=2^(-3/8)

c = log₂ z = -5/12 → z=2^(-5/12)

Wait, but I need to compute log₂(x⁴ y³ z²). Let me write that in terms of a, b, c.

log₂(x⁴ y³ z²) =4 log₂ x +3 log₂ y +2 log₂ z =4a +3b +2c

So plugging a, b, c:

4*(-7/24) +3*(-3/8) +2*(-5/12)

Let me compute each term:

4*(-7/24)= (-28)/24= -7/6

3*(-3/8)= (-9)/8

2*(-5/12)= (-10)/12= -5/6

So summing them: (-7/6) + (-9/8) + (-5/6)

First, let's find a common denominator. 6,8,6. LCD is 24.

Convert each term:

-7/6 = -28/24

-9/8 = -27/24

-5/6 = -20/24

Adding them: (-28 -27 -20)/24 = (-75)/24

Simplify: -75/24 = -25/8

So log₂(x⁴ y³ z²) = -25/8. The absolute value is 25/8.

So the value inside is 25/8, which is m/n where m=25, n=8. They are coprime.

So m +n=25+8=33.


Alright, let's solve the problem step by step.

Given the system of equations:
\[
\begin{cases}
\log_2\left(\dfrac{x}{yz}\right) = \dfrac{1}{2} \\
\log_2\left(\dfrac{y}{xz}\right) = \dfrac{1}{3} \\
\log_2\left(\dfrac{z}{xy}\right) = \dfrac{1}{4}
\end{cases}
\]
We introduce \( a = \log_2 x \), \( b = \log_2 y \), and \( c = \log_2 z \). Rewriting the equations in terms of \( a, b, c \), we have:
\[
\begin{cases}
a - b - c = \dfrac{1}{2} \\
-b - a + c = \dfrac{1}{3} \\
c - a - b = \dfrac{1}{4}
\end{cases}
\]

**Step 1: Solve for \( c \)**
Adding the first two equations:
\[
(a - b - c) + (-a + b - c) = \dfrac{1}{2} + \dfrac{1}{3} \\
-2c = \dfrac{5}{6} \Rightarrow c = -\dfrac{5}{12}
\]

**Step 2: Solve for \( a - b \)**
Using \( c = -\dfrac{5}{12} \) in the first equation:
\[
a - b - \left(-\dfrac{5}{12}\right) = \dfrac{1}{2} \Rightarrow a - b = \dfrac{1}{2} - \dfrac{5}{12} = \dfrac{1}{12}
\]

**Step 3: Solve for \( a + b \)**
Using \( c = -\dfrac{5}{12} \) in the third equation:
\[
-\dfrac{5}{12} - a - b = \dfrac{1}{4} \Rightarrow -a - b = \dfrac{1}{4} + \dfrac{5}{12} = \dfrac{2}{3} \\
\Rightarrow a + b = -\dfrac{2}{3}
\]

**Step 4: Solve for \( a \) and \( b \)**
From \( a - b = \dfrac{1}{12} \) and \( a + b = -\dfrac{2}{3} \), adding these equations:
\[
2a = -\dfrac{2}{3} + \dfrac{1}{12} = -\dfrac{7}{12} \Rightarrow a = -\dfrac{7}{24}
\]
Substituting \( a \) back:
\[
-\dfrac{7}{24} + b = -\dfrac{2}{3} \Rightarrow b = -\dfrac{17}{24} + \dfrac{16}{24} = -\dfrac{3}{8}
\]

**Step 5: Compute \( \log_2(x^4 y^3 z^2) \)**
We find:
\[
4a + 3b + 2c = 4\left(-\dfrac{7}{24}\right) + 3\left(-\dfrac{3}{8}\right) + 2\left(-\dfrac{5}{12}\right) = -\dfrac{7}{6} - \dfrac{9}{8} - \dfrac{5}{6}
\]
Converting to a common denominator (24):
\[
-\dfrac{28}{24} - \dfrac{27}{24} - \dfrac{20}{24} = -\dfrac{75}{24} = -\dfrac{25}{8}
\]
Taking the absolute value:
\[
\left|\log_2(x^4 y^3 z^2)\right| = \dfrac{25}{8}
\]
Thus, \( m = 25 \) and \( n = 8 \), so \( m + n = 33 \).

**Final Answer:**
\boxed{33}
