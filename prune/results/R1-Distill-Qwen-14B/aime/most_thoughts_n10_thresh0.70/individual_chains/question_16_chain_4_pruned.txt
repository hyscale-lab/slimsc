Okay, so I have this problem here: I need to find the least prime number p such that there's a positive integer n where n^4 + 1 is divisible by p squared. Then, I have to find the smallest positive integer m for which m^4 + 1 is divisible by p squared. Hmm, okay, let me break this down.

First, I remember that primes are numbers greater than 1 that have no divisors other than 1 and themselves. So, the primes start at 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, and so on. I need to find the smallest such prime p where n^4 + 1 is divisible by p². That means when you divide n^4 + 1 by p², there's no remainder.

I think I should start by testing small primes and see if they satisfy this condition. Let me list some small primes and check if n^4 +1 is divisible by their squares.

Starting with the smallest prime, p=2. Let's see if there's an n where n^4 +1 is divisible by 4. Let's compute n^4 +1 mod 4 for different n:

- If n is even, say n=2k, then n^4 = (2k)^4 = 16k^4, which is 0 mod 4. So n^4 +1 = 1 mod 4. That means it leaves a remainder of 1 when divided by 4, so not divisible.
- If n is odd, say n=2k+1, then n^4 = (2k+1)^4. Let's expand that: (2k+1)^4 = 16k^4 + 32k^3 + 24k^2 + 8k + 1. Modulo 4, each term with even power of 2k will be 0, except the last term, which is 1. So n^4 mod 4 is 1, and n^4 +1 mod 4 is 2. So again, not divisible by 4.

So, p=2 doesn't work because n^4 +1 is either 1 or 2 mod 4, never 0. So p=2 is out.

Next, p=3. Let's check if there's an n where n^4 +1 is divisible by 9. Let's compute n^4 modulo 9 for n from 0 to 8 (since modulo 9 repeats every 9 numbers).

Compute n^4 mod 9:

- n=0: 0^4=0 mod9=0 → 0+1=1 mod9≠0
- n=1: 1^4=1 → 1+1=2≠0
- n=2: 16 mod9=7 → 7+1=8≠0
- n=3: 81 mod9=0 → 0+1=1≠0
- n=4: 256 mod9. Let's see: 256 ÷9=28*9=252, so 256-252=4 →4+1=5≠0
- n=5: 625 mod9. 625 ÷9=69*9=621, 625-621=4 →4+1=5≠0
Wait, is that right? Wait, 5^4 is 625. Let me confirm 625 mod9: 6+2+5=13, 1+3=4. So 625 mod9=4 → 4+1=5≠0.
Wait, maybe I should compute n^4 mod9 more carefully for each n:

n=0:0
n=1:1
n=2:16-9=7
n=3:81≡0
n=4: (as above) 256 mod9: 256 - 28*9=256-252=4
n=5: same as n=4? Wait, no. Wait, 5^4 is 625. 625 mod9: 625 ÷9=69*9=621, remainder 4. So 625 mod9=4.
n=6:6^4=1296. 1296 ÷9=144, so 1296 mod9=0
n=7:7^4=2401. Let's compute 2401 mod9: 2+4+0+1=7 →7 mod9=7. 7+1=8≠0
n=8:8^4=4096. 4096 mod9: 4+0+9+6=19→1+9=10→1+0=1. So 1 mod9. 1+1=2≠0.

So none of n from 0 to8 give n^4 +1 ≡0 mod9. So p=3 doesn't work either.

Next prime is p=5. Let's check if n^4 +1 is divisible by 25. So n^4 ≡-1 mod25. Let's compute n^4 mod25 for n=1 to24, but maybe there's a smarter way.

Alternatively, perhaps using Fermat's little theorem. Wait, for
