Okay, so I've got this problem here where Alice chooses a set A of positive integers. Then Bob lists all finite nonempty sets B of positive integers such that the maximum element of B is in A. And Bob's list has 2024 sets. I need to find the sum of the elements of A.

Hmm, let me try to understand the problem step by step. So, Alice picks a set A, which is a collection of positive integers. Then Bob creates a list of all possible finite nonempty sets B. Each of these sets B has a maximum element, and that maximum must be in A. So, for example, if A is {1, 3}, then Bob's list would include sets like {1}, {3}, {1,3}, {2,3}, etc., as long as the maximum element is either 1 or 3.

Wait, but positive integers are 1,2,3,... So, for each element a in A, Bob can create sets where a is the maximum. How many such sets are there for a particular a?

Well, if the maximum is a, then the other elements of B can be any positive integers less than a. So, for a given a, the number of possible sets B where a is the maximum is equal to the number of subsets of {1,2,...,a-1}, because you can include any combination of the numbers less than a. But since B has to be non-empty and finite, each set B is non-empty, so for each a, the number of such sets is 2^{a-1}. Because the number of subsets of a set with (a-1) elements is 2^{a-1}, and each such subset corresponds to a set B where the max is a.

But wait, wait a second. Because for each a, the number of non-empty subsets of {1,2,...,a-1} is 2^{a-1} - 1. Because the total subsets are 2^{a-1}, and we subtract 1 to exclude the empty set. But then, each of these subsets can be combined with a to form a set B where a is the maximum. So, actually, the number of such sets B for a particular a is 2^{a-1} - 1. Because for each non-empty subset S of {1,...,a-1}, S union {a} is a set where a is the maximum.

Wait, but no. Wait, no. Because for each a, the set B can include any combination of numbers less than a, but B itself must be non-empty. So, the number of possible sets B where the maximum is a is equal to the number of non-empty subsets of {1,2,...,a-1}, because each non-empty subset can be combined with a to form a set. But wait, actually, no. Because the set B can consist only of a. That is, if you take the empty set and add a, you get {a}, which is a set with a as the maximum. So, maybe the number is 2^{a-1} - 1 plus 1? Wait, no.

Wait, no. Let me think again. For each a, the number of finite non-empty sets B where the maximum
