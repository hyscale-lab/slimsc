Each row and column must be monochromatic, and the placement must be maximal, meaning no additional chip can be placed without violating the constraints.\n\nTo solve this, we consider the grid divided into four regions by selecting R rows and C columns. The top-left region (R rows x C columns) can be white, the bottom-right region ((5-R) rows x (5-C) columns) can be black, and the other regions are empty. For each valid (R, C) pair, there are two configurations: one where the top-left is white and the other where it's black.\n\nAfter analyzing all possible cases and ensuring no overcounting, the total number of maximal configurations is found to be:\n\n$\\boxed{72}$"
