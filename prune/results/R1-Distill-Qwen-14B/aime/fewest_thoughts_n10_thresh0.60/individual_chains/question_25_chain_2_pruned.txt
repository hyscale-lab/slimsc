Okay, so I've got this math problem here about residents in Aimeville and the things they own. There are four items mentioned: diamond rings, golf clubs, garden spades, and a bag of candy hearts. Every resident owns at least the candy hearts because it says "each of the 900 residents owns a bag of candy hearts." So, candy hearts are universal. 

The numbers are: 
- 195 own a diamond ring,
- 367 own a set of golf clubs,
- 562 own a garden spade,
- And all 900 own a candy heart.

Now, the tricky part is that 437 residents own exactly two of these things, and 234 own exactly three. The question is asking how many own all four.

Hmm, I think this is a problem involving sets and maybe using the principle of inclusion-exclusion. I remember that the inclusion-exclusion principle helps calculate the union of multiple sets by adding their individual sizes, subtracting the intersections, adding back in the overlaps of three, and so on.

Let me denote the four sets as follows:
- D for diamond rings,
- G for golf clubs,
- S for spades (garden spade),
- C for candy hearts.

Since everyone owns a candy heart, C is the universal set here. So, the total number of residents is the size of C, which is 900.

I need to find the number of people who own all four, which is |D ∩ G ∩ S ∩ C|. But since C is everything, this is just |D ∩ G ∩ S|.

Let me think about the inclusion-exclusion formula for four sets. The formula is:

|D ∪ G ∪ S ∪ C| = |D| + |G| + |S| + |C| - |D ∩ G| - |D ∩ S| - |D ∩ C| - |G ∩ S| - |G ∩ C| - |S ∩ C| + |D ∩ G ∩ S| + |D ∩ G ∩ C| + |D ∩ S ∩ C| + |G ∩ S ∩ C| - |D ∩ G ∩ S ∩ C|.

But wait, since C is everyone, then the union is just C, so |D ∪ G ∪ S ∪ C| = |C| = 900. So, I can set up the equation as:

900 = |D| + |G| + |S| + |C| - |D ∩ G| - |D ∩ S| - |D ∩ C| - |G ∩ S| - |G ∩ C| - |S ∩ C| + |D ∩ G ∩ S| + |D ∩ G ∩ C| + |D ∩ S ∩ C| + |G ∩ S ∩ C| - |D ∩ G ∩ S ∩ C|.

But this seems complicated because I don't know all the pairwise intersections or triple intersections. Maybe there's another approach.

Oh! The problem gives me the number of people who own exactly two things and exactly three things. Let me recall that in such cases, the inclusion-exclusion principle can be adjusted by considering the exact overlaps.

Let me denote:
- a = number owning exactly two things,
- b = number owning exactly three things,
- c = number owning all four.

We know that a = 437 and b = 234. We need to find c.

Wait, but how does this connect to the inclusion-exclusion?

I think it's better to consider that the total number of people owning at least one item is equal to the sum of people owning exactly one, exactly two, exactly three, and exactly four. But in this case, since everyone owns the candy heart, maybe the problem is structured such that the overlaps are calculated considering the other three items.

Alternatively, perhaps I can model this using the principle for four sets where the number of elements in exactly k sets is given.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think in terms of the formula for the union when considering exactly two and three overlaps. Let me recall that the total
