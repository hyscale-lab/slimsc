Okay, so I've got this math problem in front of me. It's about a 2x3 grid where each cell has to have a digit. The conditions are that the sum of the two numbers formed by reading left to right is 999, and the sum of the three numbers formed by reading top to bottom is 99. Hmm, that sounds a bit tricky, but let's break it down.

First, let me visualize the grid. It's a 2-row by 3-column grid. So, the top row has three cells, and the bottom row also has three cells. Let me denote the cells as follows:

Top row: A B C
Bottom row: D E F

So the grid looks like:
A B C
D E F

Now, the first condition is that when we read left to right, we get two numbers. Since it's a 2x3 grid, the top row A B C forms a three-digit number, and the bottom row D E F also forms another three-digit number. The sum of these two numbers should be 999.

The second condition is that when we read top to bottom, each column forms a two-digit number. So, the first column is AD, the second is BE, and the third is CF. The sum of these three two-digit numbers should be 99.

The example given is:
0 0 8
9 9 1

Which gives 008 + 991 = 999, and 09 + 09 + 81 = 99. So that works.

My goal is to find the number of such possible arrangements where both conditions are satisfied. Let's take it step by step.

First, let me write down the equations based on the two conditions.

Condition 1: ABC + DEF = 999.

Condition 2: AD + BE + CF = 99.

Where ABC, DEF, AD, BE, CF are numbers formed by the respective digits.

Let me express these in terms of the digits:

ABC is 100*A + 10*B + C.

DEF is 100*D + 10*E + F.

So, equation 1: (100A + 10B + C) + (100D + 10E + F) = 999.

Similarly, AD is 10*A + D.

BE is 10*B + E.

CF is 10*C + F.

Equation 2: (10A + D) + (10B + E) + (10C + F) = 99.

So now, I have two equations:

1) 100A + 10B + C + 100D + 10E + F = 999.

2) 10A + D + 10B + E + 10C + F = 99.

Hmm, perhaps I can subtract equation 2 from equation 1 to find a relationship between the variables.

Let's compute equation 1 minus equation 2:

(100A + 10B + C + 100D + 10E + F) - (10A + D + 10B + E + 10C + F) = 999 - 99.

Simplify the left side:

(100A -10A) + (10B -10B) + (C -10C) + (100D - D) + (10E - E) + (F - F) = 900.

So, 90A -9C + 99D +9E = 900.

I can factor out 9:

9*(10A - C + 11D + E) = 900.

Divide both sides by 9:

10A - C + 11D + E = 100.

Hmm, this gives a new equation:

3) 10A - C +11D + E = 100.

So now, I have equation 2 and equation 3.

Let me write them again:

Equation 2: 10A + D + 10B + E + 10C + F = 99.

Equation 3: 10A - C +11D + E = 100.

I need to find digits A, B, C, D, E, F (each from 0 to 9) that satisfy both equations.

Let me see if I can express some variables in terms of others. Maybe express E from equation 3.

From equation 3:

E = 100 -10A + C -11D.

Wait, that's E = 100 -10A + C -11D.

Wait, but E has to be a single digit (0-9). So, 0 ≤ E ≤9.

So, substituting E into equation 2, let's see.

Equation 2: 10A + D + 10B + E +10C + F = 99.

Substitute E from equation 3:

10A + D + 10B + (100 -10A + C -11D) +10C + F = 99.

Let me simplify this:

10A + D + 10B + 100 -10A + C -11D +10C + F = 99.

Simplify term by term:

10A cancels with -10A.

D -11D = -10D.

10B remains.

100 remains.

C +10C =11C.

F remains.

So, the equation becomes:

-10D +10B +11C + F + 100 =99.

Simplify:

-10D +10B +11C + F = -1.

Hmm, that's a bit tricky. Let me rearrange:

10B +11C + F =10D -1.

Hmm, since all variables are digits (0-9), let's consider the possible ranges for each side.

Left side: 10B +11C + F.

B, C, F are digits from 0 to9.

So, 10B ranges from 0 to90.

11C ranges from 0 to99.

F is 0 to9.

So, the left side can be as low as 0 (if B=C=F=0) and as high as 90+99+9=198.

Right side: 10D -1. D is a digit from0-9, so 10D can be 0-90, so 10D -1 is -1 to89.

Hmm, but 10B +11C +F must be equal to 10D -1, which is at least -1. But 10B +11C + F is always >=0, so 10D -1 must be >=0. So, 10D -1 >=0 => D >=1 (since D is an integer digit).

So, D can be from 1 to9. Because 10D -1 >=0 => D >=1.

So, D is in 1-9.

So, 10D -1 can be 9, 19, 29, ..., 89.

So, 10B +11C + F =9,19,29,...,89.

Hmm. So, the left side must be one of
