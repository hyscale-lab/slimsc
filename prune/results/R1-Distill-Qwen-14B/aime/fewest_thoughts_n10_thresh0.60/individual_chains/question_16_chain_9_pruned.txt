Okay, so I've got this math problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's see:

The problem says: Let p be the least prime number for which there exists a positive integer n such that n⁴ + 1 is divisible by p². Then, I need to find the least positive integer m such that m⁴ + 1 is divisible by p².

Hmm, okay. So, first, I need to find the smallest prime p where p² divides n⁴ + 1 for some n. Then, once I find that p, I need to find the smallest m where m⁴ + 1 is divisible by p².

I remember that for primes p where p² divides n⁴ + 1, certain conditions must hold. I think primes p ≡ 1 mod 8 might be candidates because n⁴ ≡ -1 mod p² would require that -1 is a quartic residue modulo p². Wait, quartic residues... I'm a bit fuzzy on that.

Let me start by considering small primes and checking if their squares divide any n⁴ +1.

The primes in order are 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, etc. Let's check each of these:

First, p=2. Let's see if there's an n where n⁴ +1 is divisible by 4. Let's compute n⁴ mod 4 for n=1,2,3, etc.

n=1: 1 +1=2, which is 2 mod 4, so not divisible by 4.

n=2: 16 +1=17, which is 1 mod 4.

n=3: 81 +1=82, which is 2 mod 4.

n=4: 256 +1=257, which is 1 mod 4.

Wait, so n⁴ mod 4 alternates between 1 and 0. Because any even number n: n=2k, n⁴=16k⁴ which is 0 mod 4. So for even n, n⁴ is 0 mod 4, so n⁴+1 would be 1 mod 4, which is not 0. For odd n, n=2k+1: n²=4k(k+1)+1, which is 1 mod 4. Then n⁴=(n²)²=1²=1 mod 4. So n⁴+1 is 2 mod 4, which is also not divisible by 4. So for p=2, there's no n such that n⁴ +1 is divisible by 4. So p=2 is out.

Next, p=3. Let's check if 9 divides n⁴ +1 for some n.

Compute n⁴ mod 9. Let's check n=1 to 8 (since mod 9 cycles every 9 numbers):

n=1: 1 +1=2 mod9
n=2: 16 +1=17 mod9=8
n=3: 81 +1=82 mod9=1
n=4: 256 +1=257 mod9. Wait, 256 divided by 9: 9*28=252, so 256 is 4 mod9. 4+1=5 mod9.
n=5: 625 mod9. 625: 9*69=621, so 625 is 4 mod9. 4+1=5 mod9.
n=6: 6⁴=1296 mod9: 0, because 6 is multiple of 3, 6⁴ is multiple of 9. So 0 +1=1 mod9
