Okay, so I have this problem about rectangular boxes with a fixed surface area and volume, and I need to find the radius of the smallest sphere that can contain any of these boxes. Then, express r squared as a fraction and find p+q where the fraction is p/q in simplest terms.

Hmm, let me break this down. First, the problem says that the set B consists of all rectangular boxes with surface area 54 and volume 23. So, each box has dimensions x, y, z such that:

Surface area: 2(xy + yz + zx) = 54

Volume: xyz = 23

And we need to find the smallest sphere that can contain any such box. The radius of this sphere would be half the space diagonal of the box because the sphere has to enclose the entire box, so the diameter of the sphere must be at least as long as the space diagonal of the box.

So, the space diagonal d of a box with sides x, y, z is given by sqrt(x² + y² + z²). Therefore, the radius r is d/2, so r² would be (x² + y² + z²)/4.

Hence, to find r², I need to find the maximum value of (x² + y² + z²) over all boxes in set B, and then divide by 4.

So, the problem reduces to maximizing x² + y² + z² given that 2(xy + yz + zx) = 54 and xyz = 23.

Wait, but why are we maximizing? Because the sphere must contain all possible boxes in B, so the sphere's radius has to be big enough to contain the box with the maximum possible space diagonal. So, the minimal enclosing sphere will have a radius equal to half the maximum space diagonal among all boxes in B.

So, I need to find the maximum of x² + y² + z² given the constraints on surface area and volume.

Let me write down the equations:

1. 2(xy + yz + zx) = 54 ⇒ xy + yz + zx = 27

2. xyz = 23

And I need to maximize x² + y² + z².

I remember that in optimization problems with constraints, Lagrange multipliers can be used. But maybe I can approach this using symmetric inequalities or by expressing variables in terms of each other.

Alternatively, since the problem is symmetric in x, y, z, perhaps the maximum occurs when two variables are equal? Or maybe symmetric, but given the volume is fixed, it's not clear.

Let me think about using Lagrange multipliers.

Let me denote f(x, y, z) = x² + y² + z².

We need to maximize f subject to the constraints:

g(x, y, z) = xy + yz + zx = 27

and

h(x, y, z) = xyz = 23.

So, setting up the Lagrangian:

L = x² + y² + z² - λ(xy + yz + zx - 27) - μ(xyz - 23)

Taking partial derivatives:

∂L/∂x = 2x - λ(y + z) - μ(yz) = 0

∂L/∂y = 2y - λ(x + z) - μ(xz) = 0

∂L/∂z = 2z - λ(x + y) - μ(xy) = 0

And the constraints:

xy + yz + zx = 27

xyz = 23

Hmm, this gives a system of equations. It might get complicated, but let me see if I can find a symmetric solution first, assuming x = y = z.

If x = y = z, then:

Surface area: 2(3x²) = 54 ⇒ 6x² = 54 ⇒ x² = 9 ⇒ x = 3.

Then volume would be x³ = 27, but in our case, it's 23. So, the cube with sides 3 has volume 27, which is larger than 23. So, the maximum space diagonal occurs when the box is not a cube. So, the maximum isn't at the symmetric point.

Thus, the maximum must occur when the variables are not all equal.

Alternatively, maybe two variables are equal, and the third is different. Let's assume x = y, and find z.

So, let x = y.

Then, from the surface area equation:

xy + yz + zx = 27

Since x = y, this becomes x² + 2
