Okay, so I've got this geometry problem here. Let me try to visualize it first. There are two rectangles, ABCD and EFGH. Points D, E, C, F are collinear. Hmm, that means they lie on a straight line. Additionally, points A, D, H, G all lie on a circle. Interesting. So, ADHG is a cyclic quadrilateral.

Given lengths: BC=16, AB=107, FG=17, EF=184. We need to find the length of CE.

Let me break this down. Since ABCD is a rectangle, opposite sides are equal. So, BC=16 implies AD=16 as well. AB=107 means DC=107. Similarly, for rectangle EFGH, FG=17 and EF=184. So, EH=17 and FH=184.

Wait, hold on. In a rectangle, adjacent sides are perpendicular. So, the sides are at right angles. That might come into play with the cyclic quadrilateral.

Given that A, D, H, G lie on a circle, which makes ADHG a cyclic quadrilateral. For a quadrilateral to be cyclic, the sum of its opposite angles must be 180 degrees. Alternatively, there might be some power of point relations or something else we can use here.

Let me try to sketch this mentally. Rectangle ABCD: Let's say A is the bottom-left corner, B is top-left, C is top-right, D is bottom-right. Then, EFGH is another rectangle. Points D, E, C, F are collinear. So, the line passes through D, E, C, F. So, maybe D is connected to E, which is connected to C, then to F. Hmm, but how exactly?

Wait, maybe it's better to assign coordinates to these points to make it clearer. Let's place point D at the origin (0,0) for simplicity. Then, rectangle ABCD would have points:

- D: (0,0)
- C: (107, 0) because DC=107
- B: (0,16) because BC=16
- A: (0,16) ? Wait, that can't be right because AB=107. Wait, no, maybe I got the sides mixed up.

Wait, ABCD is a rectangle. So, AB is one side, BC is the next, CD is the opposite of AB, and DA is the other side. So, AB=107 is the length, BC=16 is the height. So, if A is at (0,0), then B would be at (107,0), C at (107,16), and D at (0,16). Wait, no, that doesn't make sense because then DC would be 107, which would make BC=16, but then D would be at (0,16). Hmm, perhaps I need to adjust.

Alternatively, maybe A is at (0,0). Then, since AB=107 and BC=16, point B is (0,107), point C is (16,107), point D is (16,0). Wait, no, that doesn't fit because then AB would be 107, BC would be 16, CD would be 107, DA would be 16. That makes sense as a rectangle.

Wait, no, if A is (0,0), and AB is vertical with length 107, then B is (0,107). Then BC is horizontal, length 16, so C is (16,107). Then CD is vertical again, length 107, so D is (16,0). Then DA is horizontal back to A, length 16. That seems correct.

Wait, but in this configuration, point D is (16,0), point C is (16,107). Then, the points D, E, C, F are collinear. So, the line passes through D (16,0), E, C (16
