Okay, so I have this tetrahedron ABCD. The edges are given in pairs: AB and CD are both √41, AC and BD are both √80, and BC and AD are both √89. Hmm, that's interesting because it seems like opposite edges are equal. I remember that in a tetrahedron, if all opposite edges are equal, it's called an isosceles tetrahedron or something like that. Maybe it's also called a disphenoid? I think that's right. So, a disphenoid is a tetrahedron where opposite edges are equal, and it has some nice properties.

The problem says there's a point I inside the tetrahedron such that the distances from I to each of the four faces are equal. I think that point is called the incenter of the tetrahedron, similar to the incenter of a triangle. The distance from the incenter to each face is the inradius. So, we need to find this inradius.

I'm trying to remember how to find the inradius of a tetrahedron. I know for a triangle, the inradius is area divided by semiperimeter. Maybe for a tetrahedron, it's something similar but involving volume and surface area? Let me think. I think the formula is 3 times the volume divided by the total surface area. Because in 3D, the volume can be thought of as the product of the inradius and the total surface area divided by 3, analogous to area = inradius * semiperimeter in 2D.

So, the formula for inradius r = 3V / S, where V is the volume and S is the total surface area. So, I need to find the volume V of the tetrahedron and the total surface area S.

First, let's find the volume. Since it's a disphenoid, I think there's a formula for the volume of a disphenoid. Alternatively, maybe I can use coordinates to find the volume. Let me try setting up coordinates for the tetrahedron.

Let me assign coordinates to the vertices. Since it's a disphenoid, it's symmetric, so I can place the points in such a way that the centroid is at the origin or something. Wait, maybe it's easier to position it so that midpoints of opposite edges are at symmetric points.

Alternatively, I remember that in a disphenoid, all four faces are congruent triangles. Wait, no, that's a regular tetrahedron. In a disphenoid, opposite edges are equal, but the faces can be different. Wait, no, maybe in this case, since all opposite edges are equal, the faces might come in congruent pairs.

Let me think: AB=CD, AC=BD, BC=AD. So, each pair of opposite edges is equal. So, face ABC and face CDA: let's see, ABC has edges AB, BC, AC, and CDA has edges CD, DA, AC. Since AB=CD, BC=AD, AC=AC. So, triangle ABC is congruent to triangle CDA. Similarly, triangle ABD is congruent to triangle BCD, and so on. So, actually, all four faces are congruent
