Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the number of intersections between two graphs. The graphs are defined by the equations:

1. \( y = 4 g(f(\sin (2 \pi x))) \)
2. \( x = 4 g(f(\cos (3 \pi y))) \)

And the functions f and g are defined as:

- \( f(x) = | |x| - \frac{1}{2} | \)
- \( g(x) = | |x| - \frac{1}{4} | \)

Hmm, this looks a bit complicated, but I think I can break it down step by step.

First, I should probably understand what the functions f and g look like. They're both absolute value functions, so they're likely V-shaped or have multiple V-shapes because of the nested absolute values.

Let me start by analyzing f(x) = | |x| - 1/2 |.

So, |x| is a V-shape with the vertex at (0,0). Then subtracting 1/2 inside the absolute value: so |x| - 1/2. That would shift the graph down by 1/2. But then taking the absolute value of that. So whenever |x| - 1/2 is negative, it will reflect above the x-axis.

Let me plot this mentally. The original |x| is V-shaped. Subtracting 1/2 from it would create a V that's shifted down, so the vertex is now at (0, -1/2). But then taking the absolute value of that, so wherever the function was negative (which would be between x = -1/2 and x = 1/2), it's flipped to be positive.

So, f(x) = ||x| - 1/2| would have a W-shape? Wait, let's think again.

Wait, when you have f(x) = | |x| - a |, with a being a positive constant, the graph will have different segments. Let me compute it step by step.

For f(x), let's consider different intervals.

Case 1: x >= 0.

Then |x| = x, so f(x) = |x - 1/2|.

Which is a V-shape with vertex at x = 1/2.

Similarly, for x <= 0, |x| = -x, so f(x) = | -x - 1/2 | = |x + 1/2|, which is another V-shape with vertex at x = -1/2.

So, putting it together, f(x) has two V-shapes: one at x = 1/2 for positive x and another at x = -1/2 for negative x. So the graph is a W-shape, symmetric about the y-axis, with vertices at x = -1/2, 0, and 1/2? Wait, actually, the function f(x) is even, so it's symmetric about the y-axis.

Wait, let me compute f(x) for some points.

At x=0: f(0) = |0 - 1/2| = 1
