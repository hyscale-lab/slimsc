Okay, let me try to wrap my head around this problem. So, we have a 5x5 grid, which is 25 cells. We have 25 white chips and 25 black chips, but they're indistinguishable. We need to place some of them in the grid with certain conditions.

First, the conditions:

1. Each cell can have at most one chip. So, no cell can have more than one chip, which makes sense because they're indistinct; we just need to know if there's a chip or not.

2. All chips in the same row must be the same color. Similarly, all chips in the same column must be the same color. Hmm, so if I place a chip in a row, all the chips in that row must be either all white or all black. Same for the columns.

3. Any additional chip placed would violate the previous two conditions. So, the configuration is maximal in a way. It's as filled as possible without breaking the rules. So, if I try to add another chip, it would either cause a row or column to have mixed colors or exceed the cell limit.

Let me think about how to model this. Since each row must have all chips of the same color, each row can be either all white, all black, or have no chips. Same for each column. Wait, but for a column, it's a bit different because the column's color is determined by the chips in that column.

Wait, no. Each column must have all chips of the same color. So, for example, if I have a column with some white and some black chips, that's not allowed. So each column must be all white, all black, or empty? Wait, but the chips are placed in the grid, so each cell is either white, black, or empty, but the constraints are that in any row, all chips (if any) are the same color, and same for any column.

Wait, no, because the chips are either white or black, so each cell can be white, black, or empty. But for any row, if there are any chips, all must be the same color. Similarly for any column.

But also, the placement is such that adding any additional chip would violate the conditions. So, the current configuration is such that every empty cell is in a row and column where adding a chip would require that row or column to have mixed colors.

Alternatively, perhaps each row and each column is either all white, all black, or all empty. Because if a row has some white and some empty, then you could add a black chip and violate the row condition. Wait, but the row must have all chips same color. So, if a row has some white chips and some empty cells, you can't add a black chip because then the row would have both white and black, which is not allowed. Similarly, if a row is empty, you can't add a chip because then all the chips in that row must be the same color, but since it's empty, adding any color would make that row have only that color. But wait, the third condition says that any additional chip placed would violate the conditions. So, perhaps the only way for a cell to be empty is if adding a chip would cause a row or column to have mixed colors.

Wait, maybe I should model this as each row and each column being either all white, all black, or all empty. Because if a row is not all white, all black, or all empty, then it's a mix, which is not allowed. So, maybe the grid is partitioned into white, black, and empty regions, with each row and column being uniform in color or empty.

So, each row can be white, black, or empty. Similarly, each column can be white, black, or empty. But now, what's the relationship between the row and column colors?

Because, for example, if a row is white, then all the cells in that row are white, and if a column is black, all the cells in that column are black. But if a row is white and a column is black, their intersection must be... a cell that is both white and black? That's impossible. So, actually, rows and columns
