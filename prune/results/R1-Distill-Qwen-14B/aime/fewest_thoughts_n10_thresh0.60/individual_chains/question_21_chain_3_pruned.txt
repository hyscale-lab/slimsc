Okay, so I have this math problem to solve. Let me read it again and make sure I understand it.

We have an integer b that's at least 2. A positive integer n is called b-eautiful if two conditions are met. First, when you express n in base b, it has exactly two digits. Second, the sum of these two digits equals the square root of n. The example given is that 81 is 13-eautiful because in base 13, 81 is written as 63, and 6 + 3 equals 9, which is the square root of 81.

The task is to find the least integer b (where b is at least 2) for which there are more than ten b-eautiful integers.

Alright, so I need to find the smallest base b such that there are more than ten numbers n that are b-eautiful.

Let me break down what it means for a number n to be two digits in base b. A two-digit number in base b is of the form a * b + c, where a and c are digits in base b. Since it's a two-digit number, a can't be zero. So, a is at least 1 and at most b-1, and c is between 0 and b-1.

So, n = a*b + c.

The other condition is that the sum of the two digits, which is a + c, equals sqrt(n). So, a + c = sqrt(n). Therefore, n must be a perfect square because the square root is an integer (since a and c are integers, their sum is an integer). So, n is a perfect square, and sqrt(n) is a + c.

Let me write down the equations:

1. n = a*b + c
2. a + c = sqrt(n)
3. Also, since n is a two-digit number in base b, it must satisfy 1*b + 0 <= n <= (b-1)*b + (b-1) => b <= n <= b^2 - 1.

But since n is a perfect square, and sqrt(n) = a + c, which is at least 1 (since a>=1 and c>=0). So, the possible values of sqrt(n) are integers starting from 1. However, n must be >= b, so sqrt(n) >= sqrt(b). But since b >=2, sqrt(b) is at least sqrt(2), which is about 1.414. Since sqrt(n) is an integer, the smallest possible sqrt(n) is 2. So, the possible values of sqrt(n) are integers s where s >=2 and s^2 <= b^2 -1. Since n <= b^2 -1, s^2 <= b^2 -1. Therefore, s <= sqrt(b^2 -1) which is approximately b, but s must be less than b because s^2 must be less than b^2.

Wait, let's check that. If s = a + c, and a <= b-1, c <= b-1, then s <= (b-1) + (b-1) = 2b - 2. But also, s^2 = n, which is less than or equal to b^2 -1. So, s must satisfy s <= sqrt(b^2 -1) which is approximately b. So, s can be as high as floor(sqrt(b^2 -1)).

Wait, let me compute sqrt(b^2 -1). For example, if b=13, sqrt(13^2 -1)=sqrt(168)=12.96, so floor is 12. So, s can be up to 12 when b=13.

So, for each base b, the possible s (the sum of digits) ranges from 2 up to floor(sqrt(b^2 -1)).

But since s is
