Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the number of intersections between two graphs. The functions are a bit complicated, but let me try to break them down step by step.

First, the functions are defined as:

- f(x) = ||x| - 1/2|
- g(x) = ||x| - 1/4|

And then the two graphs are:

1. y = 4 g(f(sin(2πx)))
2. x = 4 g(f(cos(3πy)))

I need to find how many points (x, y) satisfy both equations. That is, points where y is determined by the first equation from x, and x is determined by the second equation from y. So, it's a system of equations where each variable is defined in terms of the other.

Hmm, this seems a bit circular. Maybe I can approach it by understanding each function's behavior and then seeing how they interact.

Let me start by understanding f(x) and g(x).

f(x) = ||x| - 1/2|

This is a double absolute value function. Let's break it down. The inner function is |x|, then subtract 1/2, and take the absolute value again. So, essentially, it's the absolute value of |x| - 1/2.

Similarly, g(x) = ||x| - 1/4|.

These functions are going to take any x, reflect it to be non-negative, then shift and reflect again. So, they create a V-shaped graph, but with possible shifts and reflections.

Wait, maybe I should graph f(x) and g(x) mentally.

For f(x):

- Let's consider |x|. That's a V shape with vertex at (0,0).
- Subtract 1/2: |x| - 1/2. This shifts the graph down by 1/2. So, the vertex is now at (0, -1/2). But since we're taking absolute value, we need to see where |x| - 1/2 is negative.

Wait, |x| - 1/2 is negative when |x| < 1/2. So, for x between -1/2 and 1/2, |x| - 1/2 is negative, and the absolute value will flip it.

So, f(x) = | |x| - 1/2 |.

So, the graph will have a V shape with a vertex at x=0, but when |x| < 1/2, f(x) = 1/2 - |x|, which is a V opening downward. Then, when |x| >= 1/2, f(x) = |x| - 1/2, which is a V opening upward.

So, the overall graph of f(x) will look like a W shape, maybe? Or perhaps a combination of Vs.

Wait, let's plot some points.

At x=0: f(0)= |0 -1/2| = 1/2.

At x=1/2: f(1/2) = | (1/2) - 1/2 | = 0.

At x=1: f(1) = |1 - 1/2| = 1/2.

So, the graph goes from (0, 1/2) down to (1/2, 0) and then up to (1, 1/2). Similarly on the negative side.

So, it's a V shape that dips down to 0 at x= ±1/2 and comes back up at x= ±1.

Similarly, for g(x) = | |x| - 1/4 |.

Again, let's think about it.

|x| - 1/4 is negative when |x| < 1/4. So, for |x| < 1/4, g(x) = 1/4 - |x|. For |x| >= 1/4, g(x) = |x| - 1/4.

So, the graph of g(x) will have a V at x=0 going down to 0 at x= ±1/4, then up again.

So, it's another V shape that's narrower than f(x). The vertex is at (0, 1/4), dips to 0 at ±1/4, and then goes up.

Now, moving on to the composite functions: 4g(f(sin(2πx))) and 4g(f(cos(3πy))).

Let me try to understand each composite function.

First, let me consider 4g(f(z)), where z is some function of x or y.

So, 4g(f(z)) = 4 * | | |z| - 1/2 | - 1/4 |.

Wait, that's a bit complicated. Let me break it down:

f(z) = | |z| - 1/2 |.

Then, g(f(z)) = | |f(z)| - 1/4 |.

But since f(z) is always non-negative (it's an absolute value), the |f(z)| is just f(z). So, g(f(z)) = |f(z) - 1/4|.

Then, 4g(f(z)) = 4 |f(z) - 1/4|.

Hmm, so 4 times the absolute value of (f(z) - 1/4).

Wait, let's compute f(z):

f(z) = | |z| - 1/2 |, which we know is a function that is 1/2 - |z| for |z| <=1/2, and |z| -1/2 otherwise.

Then, |f(z) - 1/4| would be:

For f(z) >=1/4: f(z) -1/4.

For f(z) <1/4: 1/4 - f(z).

So, 4g(f(z)) is 4*(f(z) -1/4) when f(z) >= 1/4, and 4*(1/4 - f(z
