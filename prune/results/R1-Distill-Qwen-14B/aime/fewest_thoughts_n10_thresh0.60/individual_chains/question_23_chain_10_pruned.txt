Okay, let's try to tackle this problem step by step. So, we have points A, B, C, D on the hyperbola x²/20 - y²/24 = 1, and they form a rhombus ABCD with diagonals intersecting at the origin. We need to find the greatest real number less than BD² for all such rhombi.

Hmm, first, let's recall what a rhombus is. A rhombus is a quadrilateral with all sides equal, and its diagonals bisect each other at right angles. Wait, no, actually, in a rhombus, the diagonals bisect each other but aren't necessarily perpendicular unless it's a square. Wait, no, in a rhombus, the diagonals are not necessarily perpendicular, but they do bisect each other at 90 degrees. Wait, no, I think I mixed that up. Let me clarify: In a rhombus, the diagonals bisect each other at right angles. So they are perpendicular and bisect each other. Yes, that's correct.

Since the diagonals intersect at the origin, which is their midpoint, the origin is the center of the rhombus. So, points A, B, C, D are such that if A is (x, y), then C is (-x, -y), because diagonals bisect each other. Similarly, points B and D would be symmetric with respect to the origin as well.

Also, since it's a rhombus, all sides are equal. So, AB = BC = CD = DA.

But
