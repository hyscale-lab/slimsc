Okay, so I've got this problem about coloring the vertices of a regular octagon either red or blue. Each vertex is colored independently with a 50-50 chance for each color. The question is about finding the probability that there exists a rotation of the octagon such that all the blue vertices end up where there were originally red vertices. The answer needs to be in the form of a fraction m/n where m and n are coprime, and then find m + n.

Hmm, let's break this down. First, I need to visualize a regular octagon. It has eight sides, so eight vertices, each labeled maybe 0 through 7. Each vertex is colored either red or blue with equal probability. So each vertex has a 1/2 chance of being red and 1/2 chance of being blue, and the colors are independent.

Now, the problem is about rotating the octagon such that all the blue vertices move to positions that were originally red. So, after rotation, wherever there was a blue vertex, it should now be on a red vertex's original position. Wait, but the octagon can be rotated by any multiple of 45 degrees, right? Since it's regular, the rotations are multiples of 45 degrees, which correspond to shifting the vertices by 0, 1, 2, ..., 7 positions.

Wait, the question says "the octagon can then be rotated so that all of the blue vertices end up at positions where there were originally red vertices." So, perhaps for some rotation, every blue vertex moves to a position that was previously red. So, the colorings should be such that there's a rotation where blue is mapped to red.

Alternatively, maybe another way to think about it: if you have a coloring of the octagon, you can rotate it so that all the blue ones are moved to red positions. So, the coloring must be such that the set of blue vertices is a rotation of the set of red vertices. Because if you rotate the octagon so that the blue set maps to the red set, then every blue vertex moves to where a red vertex was.

Wait, but the octagon only has eight vertices, so the rotation would permute the vertices. So, if the set of blue vertices is a rotation of the set of red vertices, that would mean that the blue set is a shifted version of the red set. So, for example, if the red vertices are at positions 0,1,2,3, then the blue vertices would be at 4,5,6,7 after some rotation.

But wait, in this problem, each vertex is colored either red or blue. So, the number of red and blue vertices can vary. But for the rotation to map blue to red, the number of blue vertices must equal the number of red vertices, right? Because each blue vertex is mapped to a red vertex, so the count must be the same.

So, the colorings weâ€™re interested in are those where the number of blue vertices is equal to the number of red vertices, which would be 4 each. Because 8/2 is 4. So, first, any valid coloring for this problem must have exactly four red and four blue vertices.

Wait, but the problem says each vertex is colored either red or blue with equal probability. So, each coloring has a probability of (1/2)^8. But not all colorings will have
