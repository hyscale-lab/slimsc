Okay, so I have this geometry problem here. Let me try to parse it step by step. It involves triangle ABC inscribed in a circle ω. The tangents to ω at points B and C intersect at point D. Then, the line AD intersects ω again at point P. I'm given the lengths AB=5, BC=9, and AC=10. I need to find the length AP, express it as a reduced fraction m/n, and then compute m + n.

First, let me visualize the problem. Triangle ABC with sides 5, 9, 10. It's inscribed in a circle, so that's the circumcircle ω. The tangents at B and C meet at D, which is the ex-pole of BC or something? Wait, no, the point where the two tangents meet is called the ex-pole or just the external homothety center, maybe. Anyway, AD is drawn from A through D and intersects the circumcircle again at P. So AP is the segment from A to P, which is on the circumcircle.

I think I can approach this using power of a point, harmonic division, or perhaps using Menelaus' theorem. Alternatively, maybe some properties of poles and polars. Let me think about the power of point D with respect to ω.

Since D is the intersection of the two tangents at B and C, the power of D with respect to ω is equal to DB² = DC². Because tangent lengths from a common external point to a circle are equal.

So, Power of D: DB² = DC² = (distance from D to center squared minus radius squared). But maybe I don't need that immediately.

Alternatively, since AD passes through P, which is on ω, and A is also on ω, maybe the power of A with respect to some circle could help. But A is on ω, so the power of A is zero. Hmm.

Wait, another thought: inversion. Maybe if I invert the figure with respect to ω, but that might complicate things more.

Alternatively, since tangents from D touch ω at B and C, maybe triangle DBC is the tangential triangle or something. But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps using harmonic division. Since D is the intersection of the tangents, and AD is a line from A through D, which intersects ω again at P. Maybe D is the ex-pole of BC, making (B, C; P, A) a harmonic bundle? Not sure, but harmonic division could be useful here.

Alternatively, maybe I can use Menelaus' theorem on triangle ABC with transversal DP? Or perhaps Ceva's theorem? Hmm.

Wait, let's consider using power of point D with respect to ω. Since D lies outside ω, the power of D is DB² = DC² = DP * DA.

Because DA is the secant from D through A and P, so power of D is DP * DA = DB².

So, DP * DA = DB².

That's a useful relation.

So, DA = DP + AP. Wait, no, because A is between D and P? Or is P between A and D? Let me think.

In the Asymptote code, it says "AD intersects ω at P", so since A is on ω, and AD is drawn from A towards D, which is outside, so P must be the other intersection point after A. So, starting from A, going through D, but since D is outside, P is on the extension beyond A. Wait, no, that doesn't make sense because AD starts at A and goes towards D, which is outside. So P would be in the direction from A to D, but since A is on ω, and AD goes outward, P would be the second intersection point on the line AD, beyond A from D's perspective.

Wait, actually, no. When you draw AD, starting at A, going towards D, which is outside the circle. So the line AD starts at A (on ω), and goes towards D. Since D is outside, the line AD should intersect ω again at another point P. So, P is between A and D? Or beyond D? Wait, no. If you have a circle, and a point outside, drawing a line from outside through a point on the circle will intersect the circle again on the other side. So in this case, starting at D, drawing a line through A, which is on the circle, and then extending it, it will intersect the circle again at P. So, the order on line AD is D, A, P. So DA is the segment from D to A, and AP is from A to P.

Wait, but that's not possible because D is outside, so the line DA (or AD) starts at D, passes through A (on ω), and then goes on to intersect ω again at P. So the points on line AD in order are D, A, P. So DA is the distance from D to A, and AP is from A to P. So the entire length from D to P is DA + AP.

Wait, but in terms of power of point D, it's DB² = DP * DA.

Wait, no. Let me clarify: the power of D with respect to ω is DB², which is equal to DP * DA, where DP is the length from D to P, and DA is from D to A. So DP * DA = DB².

But DP is equal to DA + AP? Because from D to A is DA, and from A to P is AP, so DP = DA + AP.

Hmm, so DB² = (DA + AP) * DA.

But I don't know DA or AP yet. Maybe I can express DA in terms of AP.

Wait, let me denote AP as x. So then DP = DA + x. So, DB² = (DA + x) * DA.

But I don't know DA yet. Alternatively, maybe I can find DA in terms of other known quantities.

Wait, perhaps I can find DA using triangle properties.

Alternatively, maybe I can use Stewart's theorem on triangle ABC with cevian A to... Wait, but D is outside the triangle.

Alternatively, maybe I can compute the circumradius of triangle ABC, which is R, and then use some relations.

Given triangle ABC with sides AB=5, BC=9, AC=10. Let me compute the circumradius R.

Using the formula R = (a*b*c)/(4*Δ), where Δ is the area.

First, compute the semi-perimeter s = (5 + 9 + 10)/2 = 24/2 = 12.

Then, area Δ = sqrt[s(s - a)(s - b)(s - c)] = sqrt[12*(12-5)*(12-9)*(12-10)] = sqrt[12*7*3*2] = sqrt[504] = sqrt[16*31.5] = wait, 504 factors as 16*31.5? Wait, no, 504 is 16 * 31.5? No, wait 16*31.5 is 504. But 504 = 16 * 31.5? Wait, 16*31=496, 16*31.5=504. Hmm, perhaps better to factor 504 as 72 * 7. Since 72*7=504. 72 is 36*2, so sqrt(504) = sqrt(36*14) = 6*sqrt(14). So Δ = 6*sqrt(14).

Then, R = (5*9*10)/(4*6*sqrt(14)) = (450)/(24*sqrt(14)) = (75)/(4*sqrt(14)).

We can rationalize the denominator: 75/(4√14) = (75√14)/(4*14) = (75√14)/56.

So R = (75√14)/56.

Hmm, okay. But not sure if that's directly helpful yet.

Wait, perhaps I can find angles in triangle ABC using the Law of Cosines.

Let me compute angle at A, angle BAC.

Law of Cosines: cos A = (b² + c² - a²)/(2bc), where a=BC=9, b=AC=10, c=AB=5.

So cos A = (10² +5² -9²)/(2*10*5) = (100 +25 -81)/100 = (44)/100 = 11/25.

So angle A has cosine 11/25, so sin A can be computed as sqrt(1 - (121/625)) = sqrt(504/625) = sqrt(504)/25 = (6*sqrt(14))/25.

Hmm, okay. So sin A is 6√14 /25.

Now, maybe using some trigonometric relations.

Wait, another approach: Since D is the intersection of the tangents at B and C, then BD and CD are tangents. So, triangle DBC is an isoceles triangle because DB=DC. Also, the line from D to the center of ω is the angle bisector of angle BDC.

Wait, but I don't know where the center is. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps I can find the coordinates of all points by coordinate geometry. Maybe that's a bit involved, but perhaps manageable.

Let me try that. Let me place point C at (0,0), point A at (10,0), and point B somewhere in the plane. Then, I can compute coordinates of B, then find the equation of the circle ω, then find the equations of the tangents at B and C, find their intersection D, then find equation of line AD, find its intersection P with ω, then compute AP.

This might be a bit lengthy, but let's try.

First, place C at (0,0), A at (10,0). Let point B be at (x,y). Then, AC=10, BC=9, AB=5.

So, distance from A to B is 5: sqrt[(x -10)^2 + y^2] =5 --> (x-10)^2 + y^2=25.

Distance from B to C is 9: sqrt(x² + y²)=9 --> x² + y²=81.

So, subtracting the two equations: (x-10)^2 + y^2 - (x² + y²) =25 -81 --> (x² -20x +100) -x² = -56 --> -20x +100 = -56 --> -20x = -156 --> x = 156/20 = 39/5 =7.8.

So x=7.8=39/5. Then, plugging back into x² + y²=81:

(39/5)^2 + y² =81 --> (1521/25) + y² =81 --> y²=81 -1521/25 = (2025 -1521)/25 = 504/25 --> y=±sqrt(504)/5. Since the triangle is drawn above the x-axis, we'll take y as positive: y= sqrt(504)/5.

Simplify sqrt(504)=sqrt(16*31.5)= wait, no, 504=16*31.5? No, 504=16*31.5= 16*31.5=504. Alternatively, 504=72*7= 36*14. So sqrt(504)=6√14. So y=6√14 /5.

So point B is at (39/5, 6√14/5).

So now, we have coordinates:

A: (10,0)
B: (39/5, 6√14/5)
C: (0,0)

Now, I need to find the circumcircle ω of triangle ABC.

The circumcircle can be found by finding the perpendicular bisectors of AB and AC and finding their intersection.

But maybe using the circumradius formula and the coordinates.

Alternatively, let's find the circumcircle equation.

General equation of a circle: x² + y² + Dx + Ey + F =0.

Plug in the three points:

For point C (0,0): 0 +0 +0 +0 +F=0 --> F=0.

So the equation becomes x² + y² + Dx + Ey =0.

For point A (10,0): 10² +0 +10D +0 =0 --> 100 +10D=0 --> 10D = -100 --> D= -10.

So equation now: x² + y² -10x + Ey =0.

For point B (39/5, 6√14/5):

(39/5)^2 + (6√14/5)^2 -10*(39/5) + E*(6√14/5) =0.

Compute each term:

(39/5)^2 = (1521)/25.

(6√14/5)^2 = (36*14)/25 = 504/25.

-10*(39/5)= -78.

So putting it all together:

1521/25 + 504/25 -78 + (6√14 E)/5 =0.

Compute 1521 +504=2025. 2025/25=81.

So equation becomes: 81 -78 + (6√14 E)/5 =0 --> 3 + (6√14 E)/5 =0.

So (6√14 E)/5 = -3 --> E= (-3 *5)/(6√14)= (-15)/(6√14)= (-5)/(2√14).

Rationalizing:

E= (-5√14)/(2*14)= (-5√14)/28.

So the equation of the circle is x² + y² -10x - (5√14/28)y =0.

Wait, let me check the calculation again for E.

Wait, equation after plugging in B:

1521/25 + 504/25 -78 + (6√14 E)/5 =0.

Which is 2025/25 -78 + (6√14 E)/5 =0.

2025/25 is 81. So 81 -78=3.

So 3 + (6√14 E)/5 =0.

So (6√14 E)/5 = -3 --> E= (-3)*5/(6√14)= (-15)/(6√14)= (-5)/(2√14).

Yes, that's correct.

So E= (-5)/(2√14).

So now, the equation of ω is x² + y² -10x - (5√14/28)y =0.

Wait, no: wait, in the equation, it's x² + y² + Dx + Ey + F=0, so with D=-10, E= -5/(2√14), F=0.

So equation: x² + y² -10x - (5/(2√14))y =0.

Hmm, okay. Now, I need to find the equations of the tangents at B and C.

First, tangent at B: since ω is x² + y² -10x - (5√14/28)y =0.

The equation of tangent at a point (x₁,y₁) on the circle x² + y² + Dx + Ey + F=0 is xx₁ + yy₁ + D*(x + x₁)/2 + E*(y + y₁)/2 + F=0.

Wait, is that correct? Let me recall the tangent formula.

The tangent to the circle at (x₁,y₁) is given by:

T: xx₁ + yy₁ + D*(x + x₁)/2 + E*(y + y₁)/2 + F =0.

Since F=0 here, the equation becomes:

x*x₁ + y*y₁ + D*(x +x₁)/2 + E*(y + y₁)/2=0.

So for point B: (39/5, 6√14/5).

Plug into tangent equation:

x*(39/5) + y*(6√14/5) + (-10)*(x +39/5)/2 + (-5/(2√14))*(y +6√14/5)/2=0.

Let me compute each term:

First term: (39/5)x.

Second term: (6√14/5)y.

Third term: (-10)*(x +39/5)/2 = (-10/2)*(x +39/5) = (-5)*(x +39/5) = -5x -39.

Fourth term: (-5/(2√14))*(y +6√14/5)/2 = (-5/(2√14))*(y/2 + (6√14)/(5*2)) = (-5/(2√14))*(y/2 + (3√14)/5).

Wait, maybe I should compute it step by step.

Wait, (-5/(2√14))*(y +6√14/5)/2.

So that's (-5/(2√14)) * (y + 6√14/5) * (1/2) = (-5/(4√14))*(y + 6√14/5).

So let's compute that:

= (-5/(4√14)) * y - (5/(4√14))*(6√14/5).

Simplify each part:

First part: (-5/(4√14)) y.

Second part: (-5/(4√14)) * (6√14/5) = [(-5)*(6√14)] / (4√14 *5) = (-30√14)/(20√14) = (-30)/(20) = -3/2.

So the fourth term is (-5/(4√14)) y - 3/2.

Putting all the terms together:

(39/5)x + (6√14/5)y -5x -39 + (-5/(4√14)) y -3/2 =0.

Let me combine like terms.

First, terms with x:

(39/5)x -5x = (39/5 -25/5)x = (14/5)x.

Terms with y:

(6√14/5)y + (-5/(4√14)) y.

Let me combine these two coefficients.

Factor y:

[6√14/5 -5/(4√14)] y.

To combine these terms, find a common denominator. Let me rationalize 5/(4√14):

5/(4√14) = (5√14)/(4*14) = (5√14)/56.

Similarly, 6√14/5 = (6√14 *56)/(5*56) = (336√14)/280.

Wait, that might be messy. Alternatively, let me convert both to 280 denominator.

Wait, 6√14/5 = (6√14 * 56)/(5*56) = (336√14)/280.

5/(4√14) = (5 *7)/(4√14 *7)= 35/(28√14) = 35√14/(28*14)= 35√14/392.

Wait, maybe that's not helpful. Alternatively, factor out √14.

Wait, let me compute 6√14/5 -5/(4√14).

Multiply numerator and denominator to rationalize:

= (6√14/5) - (5/(4√14)).

Multiply numerator and denominator of the second term by √14:

= (6√14/5) - (5√14)/(4*14) = (6√14/5) - (5√14)/(56).

Now, find a common denominator, which is 280.

Convert each term:

6√14/5 = (6√14 *56)/280 = (336√14)/280.

5√14/56 = (5√14 *5)/280 = (25√14)/280.

So subtracting:

336√14/280 -25√14/280 = 311√14/280.

Wait, 336 -25 is 311. So 311√14/280.

So the y term is (311√14/280) y.

Now, the constant terms:

-39 -3/2 = (-78/2 -3/2) = (-81/2).

So putting it all together, the tangent at B is:

(14/5)x + (311√14/280)y -81/2 =0.

Hmm, that seems complicated. Maybe I made a mistake in calculation.

Alternatively, perhaps there's a better way to find the tangent line.

Wait, another approach: the tangent at B is perpendicular to the radius OB, where O is the center of ω.

So first, find the center O of ω.

The general equation of ω is x² + y² -10x - (5√14/28)y =0.

The center is at (D/2, E/2) with signs adjusted because the equation is x² + y² + Dx + Ey + F=0. So in this case, D=-10, E= -5√14/28.

So the center O is at (-D/2, -E/2) = (10/2, (5√14/28)/2) = (5, 5√14/56).

Wait, wait: Wait, D is the coefficient of x, which is -10. So the center is at (-D/2, -E/2) = (5, (5√14/28)/2)? Wait, no, because E is the coefficient of y, which is -5√14/28. So -E/2 is (5√14/28)/2 =5√14/(56).

So center O is at (5, 5√14/56).

So coordinates of O: (5, 5√14/56).

So vector OB is from O to B: (39/5 -5, 6√14/5 -5√14/56).

Compute 39/5 -5 = 39/5 -25/5=14/5.

6√14/5 -5√14/56 = (6√14 *56 -5√14 *5)/(5*56) = (336√14 -25√14)/280 = 311√14/280.

So the slope of OB is (311√14/280)/(14/5) = (311√14/280) * (5/14) = (311√14 *5)/(280*14).

Simplify:

5/280 =1/56, 14=14.

So slope = (311√14)/(56*14) = 311√14/(784).

So the tangent at B is perpendicular to OB, so its slope is the negative reciprocal.

So slope of tangent at B: m = - (56*14)/(311√14) = - (784)/(311√14).

Rationalize: -784√14/(311*14) = -784√14/(4354) = Simplify 784 and 4354.

Wait, 784 is 16*49=16*7². 4354 divided by 2 is 2177, which is prime? Maybe.

Alternatively, perhaps we can just write the equation of tangent at B using point-slope form.

But this seems getting complicated. Maybe I should instead find the equations of the two tangents at B and C, find their intersection D, then find equation of AD, find intersection P with ω, then compute AP.

But this is going to be a lot of computation. Maybe I can instead use the power of point D.

Wait, given that DB=DC, as D is the intersection of tangents at B and C.

Alternatively, maybe I can use coordinates but find point D as the intersection of the two tangents.

Given that the tangent at B is complicated, perhaps I can compute it another way.

Wait, the tangent at point B: (x1,y1) on the circle x² + y² + Dx + Ey + F=0 is xx1 + yy1 + (D(x + x1))/2 + (E(y + y1))/2 + F=0.

Wait, perhaps I should recompute the tangent at B.

Equation of tangent at B: x*(39/5) + y*(6√14/5) + (-10)*(x +39/5)/2 + (-5√14/28)*(y +6√14/5)/2=0.

Let me compute it step by step.

First term: (39/5)x.

Second term: (6√14/5)y.

Third term: (-10)*(x +39/5)/2 = (-10/2)*(x +39/5) = (-5x -39).

Fourth term: (-5√14/28)*(y +6√14/5)/2.

Let me compute this as:

= (-5√14/28) * y/2 + (-5√14/28) * (6√14/5)/2.

= (-5√14 y)/(56) + [ (-5√14 *6√14) ]/(28*5*2).

Simplify the second part:

-5*6*14 / (28*5*2) = (-420)/(280) = -1.5 = -3/2.

So the fourth term is (-5√14 y)/56 -3/2.

Putting all terms together:

(39/5)x + (6√14/5)y -5x -39 + (-5√14 y)/56 -3/2 =0.

Now, combine like terms.

x terms: (39/5 -5)x = (39/5 -25/5)x = 14/5 x.

y terms: (6√14/5 -5√14/56) y.

Compute 6√14/5 -5√14/56:

Convert to common denominator 280:

6√14/5 = (6√14 *56)/280 = 336√14/280.

5√14/56 = (5√14 *5)/280 = 25√14/280.

So 336√14/280 -25√14/280 = 311√14/280 y.

Constant terms: -39 -3/2 = -81/2.

So the equation is:

(14/5)x + (311√14/280)y -81/2 =0.

Similarly, the tangent at C: since C is at (0,0), the tangent at C can be computed.

Using the same tangent formula: x*0 + y*0 + (-10)*(x +0)/2 + (-5√14/28)*(y +0)/2=0.

Simplify:

0 +0 + (-10/2)x + (-5√14/28)*(y)/2=0.

So:

-5x - (5√14)/(56) y =0.

Multiply both sides by 56 to eliminate denominators:

-280x -5√14 y=0.

So the tangent at C is -280x -5√14 y=0, or simplifying, 280x +5√14 y=0.

Divide both sides by 5: 56x +√14 y=0.

So tangent at C is 56x +√14 y=0.

Now, we have two tangent equations: tangent at B and tangent at C.

We can solve these two equations to find point D.

Tangent at B: (14/5)x + (311√14/280)y =81/2.

Tangent at C: 56x +√14 y=0.

Let me write them as:

1) (14/5)x + (311√14/280)y =81/2.

2) 56x +√14 y=0.

Let me solve equation 2 for y: y= -56x /√14.

Simplify: y= -56x /√14 = (-56/√14) x = (-56√14)/(14) x = (-4√14) x.

So y= -4√14 x.

Now, plug this into equation 1.

(14/5)x + (311√14/280)(-4√14 x) =81/2.

Compute each term:

First term: (14/5) x.

Second term: (311√14/280)*(-4√14) x.

Compute (311√14 * -4√14)/(280) x.

Simplify numerator: 311*(-4)*(√14)^2=311*(-4)*14=311*(-56)= -17416.

Denominator: 280.

So second term: (-17416)/280 x.

Simplify: 17416 ÷ 280. Let's compute 280 *62=17360. 17416-17360=56. So 62 +56/280=62 + 2/10=62.2.

But with the negative sign: -62.2 x.

Wait, but exact fraction:

17416 /280= (17416 ÷4)/(280 ÷4)=4354/70= (4354 ÷2)/(70 ÷2)=2177/35.

So 17416/280=2177/35. So the second term is (-2177/35)x.

So equation becomes:

(14/5)x - (2177/35)x =81/2.

Convert to common denominator, which is 35.

14/5 x = (14*7)/(5*7) x=98/35 x.

So 98/35 x -2177/35 x = (98 -2177)/35 x = (-2079)/35 x.

So (-2079/35)x =81/2.

Solve for x:

x= (81/2) * (-35/2079) = (81*(-35))/(2*2079).

Simplify numerator and denominator:

81 and 2079: 2079 ÷81=25.7... Wait, 81*25=2025, 2079-2025=54. 54=81*(2/3). So 2079=81*(25 + 2/3)=81*(75/3 + 2/3)=81*(77/3). Hmm, not helpful.

Alternatively, factor 2079: 2079 ÷3=693. 693 ÷3=231. 231 ÷3=77. So 2079=3^3 *77=27*77.

81=3^4.

So 81/2079=3^4/(3^3 *77)=3/77.

So x= (81*(-35))/(2*2079)= (-81*35)/(2*2079)= (-81/2079)*35/2.

Compute 81/2079= (9*9)/(9*231)=9/231=3/77.

So x= (-3/77)*35/2= (-105)/(154)= (-15)/(22).

Simplify: -15/22.

So x= -15/22.

Then, y= -4√14 x= -4√14*(-15/22)= (60√14)/22= (30√14)/11.

So point D is at (-15/22, 30√14/11).

Now, we need to find the equation of line AD, where A is at (10,0) and D is at (-15/22,30√14/11).

Compute the slope of AD:

m= (y_D - y_A)/(x_D -x_A)= (30√14/11 -0)/( -15/22 -10)= (30√14/11)/( -15/22 -220/22)= (30√14/11)/( -235/22)= (30√14/11)*(-22/235)= (30√14*(-22))/(11*235).

Simplify:

30 and 235: 235=5*47, 30=5*6. So 30/235=6/47.

-22 and 11: -22/11= -2.

So m= (6√14/47)*(-2)= (-12√14)/47.

So the slope is -12√14 /47.

Now, write the equation of line AD:

Using point A (10,0):

y -0= m(x -10) --> y= (-12√14/47)(x -10).

We need to find where this line intersects ω again at point P.

The equation of ω is x² + y² -10x - (5√14/28)y=0.

Substitute y= (-12√14/47)(x -10) into the circle equation.

Let me denote m= -12√14/47 for simplicity.

So y= m(x -10).

Substitute into circle equation:

x² + [m(x-10)]² -10x - (5√14/28)[m(x-10)] =0.

Let me expand each term.

First term: x².

Second term: m²(x-10)^2= m²(x² -20x +100).

Third term: -10x.

Fourth term: -(5√14/28)*m(x-10)= -(5√14 m /28)(x -10).

So putting together:

x² + m²x² -20m²x +100m² -10x - (5√14 m /28)x + (50√14 m)/28 =0.

Combine like terms.

Terms with x²: 1 + m².

Terms with x: (-20m² -10 -5√14 m /28).

Constant terms:100m² +50√14 m /28.

So the equation becomes:

(1 + m²)x² + [ -20m² -10 - (5√14 m)/28 ]x + (100m² + (50√14 m)/28 )=0.

This is a quadratic in x. Since we know that x=10 is a solution (point A), we can factor it out.

Let me perform polynomial division or use Vieta's formula.

Let me denote the quadratic as A x² + Bx + C=0.

We know x=10 is a root, so A*(10)^2 + B*10 + C=0.

Let me compute A, B, C.

A=1 + m².

B= -20m² -10 - (5√14 m)/28.

C=100m² + (50√14 m)/28.

So, A*(10)^2 + B*10 + C =0.

Compute:

100A +10B +C=0.

Compute each term:

100*(1 + m²) +10*(-20m² -10 - (5√14 m)/28) +100m² + (50√14 m)/28 =0.

Expand:

100 +100m² -200m² -100 - (50√14 m)/28 +100m² + (50√14 m)/28=0.

Simplify:

100 -100=0.

100m² -200m² +100m²=0.

(-50√14 m)/28 +50√14 m/28=0.

So indeed, it equals zero. So the quadratic is satisfied.

Therefore, the other root can be found using Vieta's formula.

If one root is x=10, let the other root be x_p.

Then, sum of roots: x_p +10 = -B/A.

Compute -B/A:

-B/A= [20m² +10 + (5√14 m)/28 ]/(1 + m²).

So x_p= [20m² +10 + (5√14 m)/28 ]/(1 + m²) -10.

Wait, no. Wait, sum of roots is -B/A.

So x_p +10= -B/A --> x_p= -B/A -10.

But it's more straightforward to compute x_p as (-B -10A)/A.

Wait, perhaps better to compute using Vieta's formula.

Alternatively, since we have the product of roots: 10 *x_p= C/A.

So x_p= C/(10A).

Compute C/(10A):

C=100m² + (50√14 m)/28.

10A=10*(1 + m²)=10 +10m².

So x_p= [100m² + (50√14 m)/28 ]/(10 +10m² )= [100m² + (50√14 m)/28 ]/(10(1 +m²)).

Factor numerator and denominator:

Numerator: 100m² + (50√14 m)/28 =50m*(2m) + (50√14 m)/28 =50m [ 2m + √14/(28/m) ] Wait, perhaps factor 50m:

=50m [ 2m + √14/(28/(50m)) ] Wait, no, better to compute as:

=50m [ 2m + (√14)/(28/m *50) ] Hmm, perhaps not useful.

Alternatively, factor 50:

=50 [ 2m² + (√14 m)/28 ].

Denominator:10(1 +m²)=10(1 +m²).

So x_p= [50(2m² + (√14 m)/28 ) ] / [10(1 +m²)] =5 [2m² + (√14 m)/28 ] / (1 +m²).

Simplify:

x_p=5 [ (56m² + √14 m ) /28 ] / (1 +m²) =5*(56m² +√14 m)/(28(1 +m²)).

Simplify numerator and denominator:

56m² +√14 m= m(56m +√14).

So x_p=5*m(56m +√14)/(28(1 +m²)).

Now, substitute m= -12√14/47.

Compute each part.

First, compute m:

m= -12√14 /47.

Compute 56m:

56*(-12√14)/47= (-672√14)/47.

Compute 56m +√14:

(-672√14)/47 +√14= [ (-672√14) +47√14 ] /47 = (-625√14)/47.

So numerator: m*(56m +√14)= (-12√14/47)*(-625√14/47).

Multiply:

(-12√14)(-625√14)=12*625*(√14)^2=7500*14=105000.

Denominator:47*47=2209.

So m*(56m +√14)=105000/2209.

So numerator of x_p:5*(105000/2209)=525000/2209.

Denominator of x_p:28*(1 +m²).

Compute 1 +m²:

m= -12√14/47, so m²= (144*14)/(47²)=2016/2209.

So 1 +m²=1 +2016/2209= (2209 +2016)/2209=4225/2209.

So denominator:28*(4225/2209)= (28*4225)/2209.

Compute 28*4225:

4225*28: 4225*20=84500, 4225*8=33800; total=84500+33800=118300.

So denominator=118300/2209.

So x_p= (525000/2209) / (118300/2209)=525000 /118300.

Simplify:

Divide numerator and denominator by 100:5250/1183.

Check if 5250 and 1183 have common factors.

1183 ÷3: 1+1+8+3=13, not divisible by 3.

5250 ÷3=1750, so 3 is a factor of numerator but not denominator.

Check 5250 ÷5=1050, 1183 ÷5=236.6, not integer.

So 5250 and 1183 are coprime? Wait, 1183 is a prime? Let me check.

Compute 1183 ÷7=169, no, 7*169=1183? 7*160=1120, 7*9=63, so 1120+63=1183. Yes! So 1183=7*169=7*13².

So 1183=7*13².

5250=525*10=25*21*10=5² *3 *5 *7 *2=2*3*5³*7.

So factors of 5250: 2,3,5,7.

Factors of 1183:7,13.

Common factor:7.

So divide numerator and denominator by7:

5250 ÷7=750.

1183 ÷7=169.

So x_p=750/169.

So x_p=750/169.

Now, compute y_p= m(x_p -10)= (-12√14/47)(750/169 -10).

Compute 750/169 -10=750/169 -1690/169= (750-1690)/169= (-940)/169.

So y_p= (-12√14/47)*(-940/169)= (12√14 *940)/(47*169).

Simplify:

940=47*20. So 12√14 *47*20=12*20*47√14.

Denominator:47*169.

So y_p= (12*20*47√14)/(47*169)= (240√14)/169.

So point P is at (750/169,240√14/169).

Now, compute AP.

Point A is at (10,0)= (1690/169, 0).

Point P is at (750/169,240√14/169).

So vector AP has components:

Δx=750/169 -1690/169= (750-1690)/169= (-940)/169.

Δy=240√14/169 -0=240√14/169.

So AP distance is sqrt[ (Δx)^2 + (Δy)^2 ].

Compute (Δx)^2= (940/169)^2= (940)^2/(169)^2.

(940)^2= (94)^2 *10^2= (8836)*100=883600.

(Δx)^2=883600/(169)^2.

(Δy)^2= (240√14)^2/(169)^2= (57600*14)/(169)^2=806400/(169)^2.

Sum: (883600 +806400)/(169)^2=1,690,000/(169)^2.

Simplify 1,690,000= (169)^2 * (1,690,000/(169)^2).

Wait, compute 1,690,000 divided by (169)^2.

169^2=28561.

Compute 1,690,000 /28561.

Note that 28561*60=1,713,660, which is larger than 1,690,000.

Compute 28561*59=28561*(60-1)=1,713,660 -28,561=1,685,099.

So 28561*59=1,685,099.

Subtract:1,690,000 -1,685,099=4,901.

So 1,690,000=28561*59 +4,901.

Now, 4,901 /28561= approx 0.1715.

Wait, but perhaps 4,901 is 169*29. So 169*29=4,901.

Yes, 169*29=4,901.

So 1,690,000=28561*59 +169*29.

But 28561=169²= (13²)²=13^4.

So 1,690,000=169² *59 +169*29=169*(169*59 +29).

Not sure if helpful.

Alternatively, write 1,690,000= (169)^2 * (1,690,000 / (169)^2 ).

So AP= sqrt(1,690,000/(169)^2 )= sqrt(1,690,000)/169.

Compute sqrt(1,690,000)= sqrt(1,690 *1000)=sqrt(169*10*1000)=13*sqrt(10*1000)=13*sqrt(10,000)=13*100=1300.

Wait, wait:

Wait, 1,690,000=169 *10,000.

sqrt(1,690,000)=sqrt(169*10,000)=sqrt(169)*sqrt(10,000)=13*100=1300.

Yes, that's correct.

So AP=1300/169=100/13.

So AP=100/13.

Which is in reduced form, since 100 and13 are coprime.

So m=100, n=13. m +n=113.


To solve the problem, we start by noting that triangle \(ABC\) is inscribed in circle \(\omega\), with sides \(AB = 5\), \(BC = 9\), and \(AC = 10\). The tangents to \(\omega\) at \(B\) and \(C\) intersect at point \(D\), and the line \(AD\) intersects \(\omega\) again at point \(P\). We need to find the length \(AP\).

Using coordinate geometry, we place \(C\) at \((0, 0)\), \(A\) at \((10, 0)\), and determine the coordinates of \(B\) as \((\frac{39}{5}, \frac{6\sqrt{14}}{5})\). The circumcircle \(\omega\) of triangle \(ABC\) is found to have the equation \(x^2 + y^2 - 10x - \frac{5\sqrt{14}}{28}y = 0\), with center \(O\) at \((5, \frac{5\sqrt{14}}{56})\).

Next, we find the equations of the tangents at \(B\) and \(C\). The tangent at \(C\) is \(56x + \sqrt{14}y = 0\), and the tangent at \(B\) is computed using the point-slope form. Solving these tangents, we find point \(D\) at \(\left(-\frac{15}{22}, \frac{30\sqrt{14}}{11}\right)\).

The equation of line \(AD\) is determined with slope \(-\frac{12\sqrt{14}}{47}\), passing through \(A(10, 0)\). Substituting this into the circumcircle equation, we solve for the intersection point \(P\). Using Vieta's formulas and polynomial division, we find \(P\) at \(\left(\frac{750}{169}, \frac{240\sqrt{14}}{169}\right)\).

Finally, the distance \(AP\) is calculated using the distance formula, resulting in \(AP = \frac{100}{13}\). Thus, \(m = 100\) and \(n = 13\), giving \(m + n = 113\).

\(\boxed{113}\)
