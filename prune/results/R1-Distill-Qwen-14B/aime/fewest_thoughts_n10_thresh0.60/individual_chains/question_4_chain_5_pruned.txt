Okay, so I have this problem where Alice and Bob are playing a game with a stack of n tokens. They take turns removing either 1 or 4 tokens each turn. Alice goes first, and whoever takes the last token wins. I need to find how many positive integers n â‰¤ 2024 allow Bob to have a winning strategy no matter how Alice plays.

Hmm, let me think about how this game works. It's similar to other impartial games like Nim, so maybe I can model it using the concept of winning and losing positions.

A winning position is one where the current player can force a win no matter what the opponent does. Conversely, a losing position is one where no matter what the current player does, the opponent can force a win.

So, in this case, the game starts with n tokens. On each turn, a player can remove 1 or 4 tokens. Let's try to determine for small n whether it's a winning (W) or losing (L) position.

Let's list out the positions from n=0 upwards.

n=0: Well, if there are no tokens, the game is over. But since the last token was taken by the previous player, that player wins. So n=0 is a losing position for the current player because they can't make a move.

n=1: The current player can take 1 token and win. So W.

n=2: Take 1 token, leaving 1 for the opponent, who then will take it and win. Wait, but if you take 1, opponent takes 1 and wins. Or, if you take 1, opponent can take 1 and win. Wait, no, if n=2, you can take 1, leaving 1, which is W for the opponent, meaning you lose. Alternatively, can you take 4? No, because n=2 <4. So for n=2, you can only take 1, which leads to opponent taking the last one. So n=2 is L.

Wait, wait, maybe I should think again. If n=2, current player can take 1, leaving 1 for the opponent. Opponent can then take 1 and win. So n=2 is losing for the current player.

n=3: Similarly, current player can take 1, leaving 2, which we just determined is a losing position for the opponent. So n=3 is a winning position. Because you can force the opponent into a losing position.

Wait, so when n=3, taking 1 leaves n=2 (L), so opponent is in L, so you win.

n=4: You can take 4 and win immediately. So W.

n=5: Let's see. If you take 1, leaving n=4, which is W for the opponent. Or take 4, leaving n=1, which is W for the opponent. Because opponent can take 1 and win. So n=5 is L?

Wait, hold on. Wait, n=4 is W because the opponent can take all 4 and win. So if you leave them with n=4, they can win. Alternatively, if you take 4 from n=5, leaving n=1, opponent takes 1 and wins. So in both options, opponent can win. So n=5 is L.

n=6:
