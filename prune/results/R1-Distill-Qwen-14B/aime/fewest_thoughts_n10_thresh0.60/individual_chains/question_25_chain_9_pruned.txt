Okay, so I have this problem about residents in Aimeville and the things they own. Let me try to parse it out step by step. I remember that these kinds of problems often involve using the principle of inclusion-exclusion, so maybe that's what I'll need here.

First, let me list out all the numbers given:

- Total residents: 900.
- Number owning a diamond ring: 195.
- Number owning a set of golf clubs: 367.
- Number owning a garden spade: 562.
- Everyone owns a bag of candy hearts, so that's 900 people.
- Number of people owning exactly two of these things: 437.
- Number of people owning exactly three of these things: 234.

And the question is asking for the number of residents who own all four of these items. I'll call this number x, which is what we're trying to find.

Hmm, so let me think about how inclusion-exclusion works. For four sets, the formula is a bit involved, but maybe I can break it down. The principle of inclusion-exclusion for four sets A, B, C, D is:

|A ∪ B ∪ C ∪ D| = |A| + |B| + |C| + |D| - |A∩B| - |A∩C| - |A∩D| - |B∩C| - |B∩D| - |C∩D| + |A∩B∩C| + |A∩B∩D| + |A∩C∩D| + |B∩C∩D| - |A∩B∩C∩D|

But wait, in our case, everyone owns at least the candy hearts. So actually, the union of all four sets is the entire population, right? Because candy hearts are universal. So |A ∪ B ∪ C ∪ D| = 900. That might simplify things.

So, plugging into the formula:

900 = |A| + |B| + |C| + |D| - |A∩B| - |A∩C| - |A∩D| - |B∩C| - |B∩D| - |C∩D| + |A∩B∩C| + |A∩B∩D| + |A∩C∩D| + |B∩C∩D| - |A∩B∩C∩D|

But wait, in our problem, D is the set of people who own a bag of candy hearts. Since every resident owns that, D is the entire set of 900. So, |D|=900, and all intersections involving D are just the other sets because D is everyone. Hmm, maybe this can be simplified.

Wait, maybe that's complicating things. Let me think differently. Since everyone owns D, then if I consider the other three items (A, B, C), the number of people owning at least one of A, B, C is equal to the number owning at least one of the four items, which is 900. So maybe I can adjust the problem to consider A, B, C, and then D is automatically included.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to model this using the inclusion
