Okay, so I've got this problem here where I need to find the number of intersections between two graphs. The functions are defined as y = 4 g(f(sin(2πx))) and x = 4 g(f(cos(3πy))). Hmm, that sounds a bit complicated, but I'll try to break it down step by step.

First, let's understand what f(x) and g(x) are. The problem defines f(x) as ||x| - 1/2| and g(x) as ||x| - 1/4|. So, both f and g are functions that take the absolute value of x, subtract a fraction, and then take the absolute value again. That probably makes them V-shaped graphs with some transformations.

Let me sketch f(x) and g(x) mentally. For f(x): starting with |x|, which is a V pointing upwards with the vertex at (0,0). Then subtract 1/2, so that would shift the graph down by 1/2, but since we take the absolute value again, it actually reflects any negative parts back up. So the resulting graph of f(x) should have a V shape, but with the vertex at (0, 1/2). Wait, no, actually, when you subtract 1/2 from |x|, the vertex is at (0, -1/2), but then taking the absolute value of that would flip the part below the x-axis back up. So, the vertex of f(x) would be at (0,1/2), and it would have two V shapes pointing upwards, one on the left and one on the right, each with a slope of 1. So, f(x) is a W shape? Or maybe a V with two arms.

Wait, maybe I should calculate some points. Let me plug in x=0: f(0) = ||0| - 1/2| = | -1/2 | = 1/2. For x=1/2: f(1/2) = ||1/2| -1/2| = |0| = 0. For x=1: f(1) = ||1| -1/2| = |1/2| = 1/2. Similarly for negative x: f(-1/2) = 0, f(-1)
