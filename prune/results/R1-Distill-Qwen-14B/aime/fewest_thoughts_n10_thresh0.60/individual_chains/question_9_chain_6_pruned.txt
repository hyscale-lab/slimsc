Okay, so I've got this problem here: there are real numbers x and y, both greater than 1, such that log base x of y^x equals 10, and log base y of x^{4y} also equals 10. I need to find the product xy.

Hmm, let me write down the given equations:

1. log_x(y^x) = 10
2. log_y(x^{4y}) = 10

I remember that logarithms can be tricky, but maybe I can convert these into exponential form or use some logarithmic identities to simplify them.

Starting with the first equation: log_x(y^x) = 10.

Wait, log base x of y^x. There's a logarithm property that says log_b(a^c) = c * log_b(a). So applying that here, I can bring the exponent x down in front.

So, that becomes x * log_x(y) = 10.

Hmm, okay. So x * log_x(y) = 10. But log_x(y) is the same as (ln y)/(ln x), right? Because log_b(a) = ln a / ln b.

So substituting that in, we get x * (ln y / ln x) = 10.

But that feels a bit complicated. Maybe another approach. Let me denote log_x(y) as some variable to make it simpler. Let me say, let’s set log_x(y) = k. Then, according to the first equation, k * x = 10.

But log_x(y) = k implies that x^k = y. So y = x^k.

Since we have y expressed in terms of x, maybe we can substitute this into the second equation.

Looking at the second equation: log_y(x^{4y}) = 10.

Again, using the same logarithm property, this becomes 4y * log_y(x) = 10.

Hmm, log_y(x) is the reciprocal of log_x(y), right? Because log_b(a) = 1 / log_a(b). So log_y(x) = 1 / log_x(y) = 1/k.

So substituting that in, 4y * (1/k) = 10.

So 4y / k = 10.

But from earlier, we have that k = 10 / x because k * x = 10.

So substituting k = 10/x into 4y/(k) = 10, we get:

4y / (10/x) = 10.

Simplify the denominator: dividing by (10/x) is the same as multiplying by x/10.

So 4y * (x/10) = 10.

Which simplifies to (4y x) / 10 = 10.

Multiply both sides by 10: 4xy = 100.

Divide both sides by 4: xy = 25.

Wait, so is that it? xy is 25?

But let me double-check because sometimes I might have made a mistake in the substitutions.

So, let's see:

We started with log_x(y^x) = 10 → x * log_x(y) = 10 → log_x(y) = 10/x.

Then, y = x^{10/x}.

Then, the second equation is log_y(x^{4y}) = 10 → 4y * log_y(x) = 10.

But log_y(x) is 1 / log_x(y) = 1/(10/x) )= x/10.

So substituting back, 4y * (x/10) = 10 → (4xy)/10 = 10 → 4xy = 100 → xy = 25.

Yes, that seems correct.

Alternatively, maybe I can express both equations in terms of exponents and solve for x and y.

Let me try that approach for verification.

First equation: log_x(y^x) = 10 → y^x = x^{10}.

Because log_b(a) = c implies that b^c = a. So here, x^10 = y^x.

Second equation: log_y(x^{4y}) =10 → x^{4y} = y^{10}.

So now we have two equations:

1
