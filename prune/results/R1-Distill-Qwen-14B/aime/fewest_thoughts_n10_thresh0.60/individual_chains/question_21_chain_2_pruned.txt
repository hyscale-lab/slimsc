Okay, so I've got this problem here where I need to find the least integer base b (where b is at least 2) such that there are more than ten b-eautiful integers. Hmm, let me make sure I understand what a b-eautiful integer is.

From the problem, a positive integer n is called b-eautiful if two conditions are met:
1. When n is expressed in base b, it has exactly two digits.
2. The sum of these two digits equals the square root of n.

The example given is that 81 is 13-eautiful because in base 13, 81 is written as 63 (since 6*13 + 3 = 81), and 6 + 3 equals 9, which is the square root of 81. Got it.

So, my task is to find the smallest b (starting from 2 upwards) where there are more than ten such numbers n that satisfy these conditions.

Let me break this down step by step.

First, I need to represent n in base b. Since it's a two-digit number in base b, it can be written as n = a*b + c, where a and c are digits in base b. That means a can range from 1 to b-1 (since it's the leading digit and can't be zero), and c can range from 0 to b-1.

So, n = a*b + c.

The second condition is that the sum of the digits a + c equals the square root of n. So, sqrt(n) = a + c.

But n is a*b + c, so substituting that into the equation gives:

a + c = sqrt(a*b + c).

Let me square both sides to eliminate the square root:

(a + c)^2 = a*b + c.

Expanding the left side:

a² + 2*a*c + c² = a*b + c.

Hmm, let's rearrange terms:

a² + 2*a*c + c² - a*b - c = 0.

Let me factor this equation somehow. Maybe group terms:

a² - a*b + 2*a*c + c² - c = 0.

Hmm, perhaps factor out a from the first two terms:

a*(a - b) + c*(2*a + c - 1) = 0.

Wait, that might not help much. Maybe I can rearrange differently:

a² + (2c - b)*a + (c² - c) = 0.

This looks like a quadratic equation in terms of a:

a² + (2c - b)*a + (c² - c) = 0.

Since a is an integer between 1 and b-1, and c is between 0 and b-1, perhaps I can solve this quadratic for a and see what constraints on b emerge.

Alternatively, maybe I can consider that a and c are digits, so both a and c are non-negative integers (with a ≥ 1) and less than b. So, perhaps it's better to think of a and c as variables in terms of b and find the possible b for which this equation has multiple solutions.

Alternatively, perhaps I can express a in terms of c and b, or vice versa.

Wait, let me think. Since a and c are digits in base b, their possible values are limited, so maybe for each base b, I can iterate over possible a and c and check if they satisfy the equation. But since I'm looking for more than ten such numbers, I need to find the smallest b where there are more than ten (a, c) pairs that satisfy the condition.

But that's computationally intensive, so perhaps I can find a pattern or formula.

Wait, let's go back to the equation:

(a + c)^2 = a*b + c.

Let me denote s = a + c. Then s² = a*b + c.

But since s = a + c, we can express c as s - a. Substituting that into the equation:

s² = a*b + (s - a).

Expanding:

s² = a*b + s - a.

Let's bring all terms to one side:

s² - s = a*(b - 1).

So, a = (s² - s)/(b - 1).

Hmm, that's interesting. Since a must be an integer between 1 and b-1, and c must be between 0 and b-1, this equation gives a in terms of s and b.

But s is the sum of a and c, which, since a is at least 1 and c is at least 0, s is at least 1. Also, since a is at most b-1 and c is at most b-1, s can be at most 2*(b-1). So, s ranges from 1 to 2*(b-1).

So, for each possible s, we can compute a as (s² - s)/(b - 1). But a must be an integer between 1 and b-1, and c = s - a must also be between 0 and b-1.

Therefore, for a given b, I can iterate over possible s values and check if (s² - s) is divisible by (b -1), and if so, then a would be an integer. Then, I can check whether a and c are valid digits in base b.

Wait, but the problem is that the number of possible s for each b could vary, and we need to find the minimal b where the count of such (a, c) pairs is more than 10.

Alternatively, perhaps I can express b in terms of s and a.

From a = (s² - s)/(b - 1), we can rearrange to find:

b - 1 = (s² - s)/a.

So, b = 1 + (s² - s)/a.

Since b must be an integer greater than or equal to 2, (s² - s) must be divisible by a, and the result must be such that b is an integer.

Also, since a is a digit in base b, a must be less than b, which is 1 + (s² - s)/a.
