Okay, so I'm trying to solve this problem where I need to find the smallest integer base b (where b is at least 2) such that there are more than ten b-eautiful numbers. Hmm, let me make sure I understand the problem correctly.

First, a number n is called b-eautiful if two conditions are met:
1. When n is written in base b, it has exactly two digits. That means n is between b^1 and b^2 - 1, right? Because in base b, the two-digit numbers range from b (which is 10_b) up to (b^2 - 1) (which is (b-1)(b-1)_b).
2. The sum of these two digits equals the square root of n. So if n in base b is written as a two-digit number with digits d1 and d2, then d1 + d2 = sqrt(n).

The example given is 81 being 13-eautiful because 81 in base 13 is 63_13, and 6 + 3 = 9, which is sqrt(81). So that checks out.

My goal is to find the least integer b where there are more than ten such numbers. So I need to find, for each base b starting from 2, how many numbers n satisfy those two conditions, and find the smallest b where this count exceeds ten.

Let me structure my approach.

First, for a given base b, the two-digit numbers in base b are from b (10_b) to b^2 - 1 (which is (b-1)(b-1)_b). Each two-digit number can be written as n = d1*b + d2, where d1 and d2 are digits in base b. So d1 can be from 1 to b-1, and d2 can be from 0 to b-1.

The condition is that d1 + d2 = sqrt(n). Since n is equal to d1*b + d2, substituting, we have d1 + d2 = sqrt(d1*b + d2).

Let me write this equation down:

d1 + d2 = sqrt(d1*b + d2)

Let me square both sides to eliminate the square root:

(d1 + d2)^2 = d1*b + d2

Expanding the left side:

d1^2 + 2*d1*d2 + d2^2 = d1*b + d2

Let me rearrange this equation:

d1^2 + 2*d1*d2 + d2^2 - d1*b - d2 = 0

Hmm, maybe I can factor this or find a way to express it more simply. Let me group terms:

d1^2 + (2*d2 - b)*d1 + (d2^2 - d2) = 0

This is a quadratic equation in terms of d1. So for given d2, we can solve for d1. Alternatively, maybe it's better to think of it as a quadratic in d2. Let me see.

Wait, perhaps I can think of this equation differently. Let me write it again:

d1^2 + 2*d1*d2 + d2^2 = d1*b + d2

Let me think about this. The left side is (d1 + d2)^2, right? So (d1 + d2)^2 = d1*b + d2.

So we can write this as:

(d1 + d2)^2 = d1*b + d2

Let me denote s = d1 + d2, so the equation becomes:

s^2 = d1*b + d2

But since s = d1 + d2, maybe I can express d2 as s - d1, and substitute that into the equation.

So s^2 = d1*b + (s - d1)

Simplify that:

s^2 = d1*b + s - d1

Bring all terms to one side:

s^2 - s = d1*(b - 1)

So, d1 = (s^2 - s) / (b - 1)

Hmm, interesting. Since d1 must be an integer between 1 and b-1, inclusive, this fraction must evaluate to an integer. So (s^2 - s) must be divisible by (b - 1).

Also, since d2 = s - d1, and d2 must be between 0 and b-1, inclusive, because it's a digit in base b.

So for each possible s, we can compute d1 and check if d2 is within the valid range.

But wait, what's the possible range of s? Let's think.

s is d1 + d2. Since d1 is at least 1 and at most b-1, and d2 is at least 0 and at most b-1, the minimum s is 1 + 0 = 1, and the maximum s is (b-1) + (b-1) = 2b - 2.

So s can range from 1 to 2b - 2.

But also, since s^2 = d1*b + d2, and d1*b + d2 is n, which is a two-digit number in base b, so n is between b and b^2 - 1. So s^2 must be between b and b^2 - 1.

So s must satisfy sqrt(b) ≤ s ≤ sqrt(b^2 - 1)

But sqrt(b) is less than b, so perhaps the range of s is more constrained.

Wait, but s is an integer because d1 and d2 are integers. So s must be an integer such that s ≥ sqrt(b) and s ≤ sqrt(b^2 - 1). Let me compute the approximate range.

sqrt(b^2 - 1) is approximately b - 1/(2b), so it's just a bit less than b. So s must be less than or equal to b - 1, since s is an integer.

Wait, but earlier I thought s could go up to 2b - 2, but that's when considering s as the sum of d1 and d
