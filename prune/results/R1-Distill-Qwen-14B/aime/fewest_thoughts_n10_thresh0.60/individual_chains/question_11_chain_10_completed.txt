Okay, so I've got this math problem here, and I need to find the largest possible real part of the expression \[(75 + 117i)z + \frac{96 + 144i}{z}\], where \( z \) is a complex number with \( |z| = 4 \). Hmm, let's see. I'm a bit rusty on complex numbers, but I remember some key concepts. 

First, since \( |z| = 4 \), that tells me that \( z \) is a complex number lying on a circle in the complex plane with radius 4. I can represent \( z \) in polar form, which might make things easier. So, let me write \( z = 4e^{i\theta} \), where \( \theta \) is the argument of \( z \). That seems right because the modulus is 4, and the exponential form captures the magnitude and angle.

Now, substituting \( z = 4e^{i\theta} \) into the expression, let's handle each term separately. The first term is \( (75 + 117i)z \). Plugging in \( z \), that becomes \( (75 + 117i) \times 4e^{i\theta} \). I can factor out the 4: \( 4(75 + 117i)e^{i\theta} \). 

The second term is \( \frac{96 + 144i}{z} \). Since \( z = 4e^{i\theta} \), the reciprocal is \( \frac{1}{4}e^{-i\theta} \). So, multiplying by the numerator, it becomes \( (96 + 144i) \times \frac{1}{4}e^{-i\theta} \). Simplifying that, \( \frac{96 + 144i}{4} = 24 + 36i \), so the second term is \( (24 + 36i)e^{-i\theta} \).

Putting it all together, the entire expression is \( 4(75 + 117i)e^{i\theta} + (24 + 36i)e^{-i\theta} \).

Now, I need to compute the real part of this expression. Let's denote \( A = 75 + 117i \) and \( B = 24 + 36i \). So, the expression becomes \( 4A e^{i\theta} + B e^{-i\theta} \).

The real part of this expression can be found by taking the real part of each term and adding them together. Remember that for a complex number \( C e^{i\theta} \), the real part is \( Re(C e^{i\theta}) = |C| \cos(\theta + \phi) \), where \( \phi \) is the argument of \( C \). Alternatively, we can use the formula \( Re(C e^{i\theta}) = Re(C) \cos\theta - Im(C) \sin\theta \), but that might get messy. Maybe a better approach is to express each term in terms of sine and cosine.

Alternatively, I remember that for a complex number \( C = a + bi \), \( C e^{i\theta} = (a + bi)(\cos\theta + i\sin\theta) = (a\cos\theta - b\sin\theta) + i(a\sin\theta + b\cos\theta) \). So, the real part is \( a\cos\theta - b\sin\theta \).

Similarly, \( C e^{-i\theta} = (a - bi)(\cos\theta - i\sin\theta) = (a\cos\theta + b\sin\theta) - i(a\sin\theta - b\cos\theta) \). So, the real part is \( a\cos\theta + b\sin\theta \).

So, applying this to both terms:

First term: \(4A e^{i\theta}\) has real part \(4[Re(A)\cos\theta - Im(A)\sin\theta]\).

Second term: \(B e^{-i\theta}\) has real part \(Re(B)\cos\theta + Im(B)\sin\theta\).

So, putting it all together, the real part of the entire expression is:

\(4[Re(A)\cos\theta - Im(A)\sin\theta] + [Re(B)\cos\theta + Im(B)\sin\theta]\).

Let me plug in the values:

Re(A) is 75, Im(A) is 117, Re(B) is 24, Im(B) is 36.

So, substituting:

4[75 cosθ - 117 sinθ] + [24 cosθ + 36 sinθ]

Expanding this:

4*75 cosθ - 4*117 sinθ + 24 cosθ + 36 sinθ

Calculating the coefficients:

4*75 = 300; 4*117 = 468; 24 remains as is; 36 remains as is.

So, the expression becomes:

300 cosθ - 468 sinθ + 24 cosθ + 36 sinθ

Combine like terms:

(300 + 24) cosθ + (-468 + 36) sinθ

Which is:

324 cosθ - 432 sinθ

So, the real part is 324 cosθ - 432 sinθ. Now, I need to find the maximum value of this expression as θ varies.

Hmm, okay. So, I have an expression of the form \( C \cosθ + D \sinθ \), which can be rewritten as \( R \cos(θ + φ) \), where \( R = \sqrt{C^2 + D^2} \). The maximum value of such an expression is R.

So, let's compute R here.

C is 324, D is -432.

So, R = sqrt(324² + (-432)²)

Calculating 324 squared: 324 * 324. Let me compute that.

324 * 300 = 97,200; 324 * 24 = 7,776; so total is 104,976.

Similarly, (-432)^2 is 432². 400² is 160,000; 32² is 1024; and cross term 2*400*32=25,600. So, (400+32)^2 = 400² + 2*400*32 + 32² = 160,000 + 25,600 + 1024 = 186,624.

So, R = sqrt(104,976 + 186,624) = sqrt(291,600).

What's sqrt(291,600)? Let's see, 500² is 250,000; 540² is 291,600 because 500²=250k, 540² = (500+40)²=500² + 2*500*40 +40²=250k +40k +1.6k=291.6k. So, 540²=291,600. Therefore, R=540.

So, the maximum value of the real part is 540.

Wait, let me make sure I didn't miss anything. So, the expression simplifies to 324 cosθ - 432 sinθ, which can be expressed as 540 cos(θ + φ), where φ is some phase shift. The maximum value of cosine is 1, so the maximum of the expression is 540 * 1 = 540.

Therefore, the largest possible real part is 540.

To recap:

1. Expressed z in polar form as 4 e^{iθ}.
2. Substituted into the expression, breaking it into two parts.
3. Calculated the real parts of each term.
4. Combined like terms to get an expression in terms of cosθ and sinθ.
5. Recognized the form as a sinusoidal function and computed its amplitude R.
6. Concluded that the maximum real part is R, which is 540.

I think that covers all the steps. I don't see any mistakes in the calculations. The key was recognizing that the real part simplifies to a single sinusoidal function, whose maximum is its amplitude.


To find the largest possible real part of the expression \[(75 + 117i)z + \frac{96 + 144i}{z}\] where \( |z| = 4 \), we start by expressing \( z \) in polar form as \( z = 4e^{i\theta} \). Substituting \( z \) into the expression, we rewrite each term using this form.

First, the term \((75 + 117i)z\) becomes \(4(75 + 117i)e^{i\theta}\). The second term, \(\frac{96 + 144i}{z}\), becomes \((24 + 36i)e^{-i\theta}\). Combining these, the entire expression is:

\[
4(75 + 117i)e^{i\theta} + (24 + 36i)e^{-i\theta}.
\]

To find the real part, we use the fact that for a complex number \( C = a + bi \), the real part of \( C e^{i\theta} \) is \( a\cos\theta - b\sin\theta \), and the real part of \( C e^{-i\theta} \) is \( a\cos\theta + b\sin\theta \). Applying this to each term, the real part of the expression becomes:

\[
4[75\cos\theta - 117\sin\theta] + [24\cos\theta + 36\sin\theta].
\]

Simplifying, we combine like terms:

\[
324\cos\theta - 432\sin\theta.
\]

This expression can be rewritten in the form \( R\cos(\theta + \phi) \), where \( R = \sqrt{324^2 + (-432)^2} \). Calculating \( R \):

\[
R = \sqrt{324^2 + 432^2} = \sqrt{104,976 + 186,624} = \sqrt{291,600} = 540.
\]

The maximum value of \( R\cos(\theta + \phi) \) is \( R \), so the largest possible real part of the given expression is:

\[
\boxed{540}
\]
