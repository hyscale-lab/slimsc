Okay, so I have this geometry problem here. Let me try to visualize it first. There's a triangle ABC inscribed in a circle ω. The tangents at points B and C intersect at point D. Then, the line AD intersects the circle ω again at point P. We're given the lengths AB = 5, BC = 9, and AC = 10. We need to find the length of AP, which can be written as a fraction m/n where m and n are coprime, and then find m + n.

Hmm, I remember that when dealing with tangents to a circle, the lengths from the external point to the points of tangency are equal. So, since D is the intersection of the tangents at B and C, DB and DC should be equal. That might come in handy later.

Given the sides of the triangle, maybe I can use some triangle properties or theorems to find the required length. Since the triangle is inscribed in a circle, perhaps the Power of a Point theorem could be useful here. Power of a Point often relates the lengths of segments created by lines intersecting a circle.

Let me recall the Power of a Point theorem. It states that for a point D outside a circle, the product of the lengths of the two segments from D to the circle is equal for any two lines through D. Specifically, for point D, since it's the intersection of the tangents at B and C, the power of D with respect to ω should be DB² = DC². But wait, since DB and DC are tangents, they are equal, which we already established.

So, Power of a Point tells us that DB² = DC² = DP * DA. Because AD is a secant intersecting the circle at A and P. So, if I can find DA, then I can relate it to DP and AP.

Wait, but AP is the segment we need to find. Let me denote AP as x. Then, since AD is from A to D, and P is a point on AD, the length AD must be AP + PD. So, AD = x + PD. Or, rearranged, PD = AD - x.

But from the Power of a Point, DB² = DP * DA. So, DB² = (AD - x) * AD. Hmm, that's a quadratic in terms of AD. But I don't know AD yet. Maybe I can find AD in another way.

Alternatively, perhaps using similar triangles or other triangle theorems would help. Maybe Menelaus' theorem or Ceva's theorem? Or perhaps coordinate geometry?

Wait, but maybe using Menelaus on triangle ABC with transversal something? Or using the properties of harmonic division or something related to poles and polars?

Alternatively, since ABC is a triangle with given side lengths, maybe I can compute some angles or use the Law of Cosines to find some angles. Let me try that.

Given AB = 5, BC = 9, and AC = 10. Let's see, triangle ABC has sides 5, 9, 10. Let me check if it's a right-angled triangle. 5² + 9² = 25 + 81 = 106, which is less than 10²
