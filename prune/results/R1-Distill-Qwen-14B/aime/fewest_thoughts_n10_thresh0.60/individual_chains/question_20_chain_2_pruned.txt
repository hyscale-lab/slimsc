Okay, so I've got this math problem to solve, and I want to figure it out step by step. Let me try to understand what's being asked here.

We have 25 white chips and 25 black chips, all indistinguishable. We need to place some of these chips in a 5x5 grid. Each cell can hold at most one chip. Now, there are a couple of conditions:

1. All chips in the same row must be the same color.
2. All chips in the same column must be the same color.
3. Additionally, any extra chip we try to place would break one or both of the first two conditions.

Hmm. So, essentially, the grid will have some rows with all white chips, some with all black, same for columns. But wait, no, because it's possible that a row has some white and some black chips, but the condition says that all chips in the same row must be the same color. So each row is either all white or all black, right? Similarly for each column.

But then, wait, there's a third condition: any additional chip would violate the first two. So that means the grid is already as "complete" as possible. So perhaps we can't add any more chips without breaking the row or column color conditions.

Wait, but if all rows are either all white or all black, but maybe not all of them are filled. Similarly for columns. So the grid is such that for each row, you can choose to have white or black, but if you choose white, you have to place all the white chips in that row. But no, wait, each cell can have at most one chip, but the color has to be the same for the entire row.

Wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me rephrase.

Each row can be either all white or all black, but you don't have to fill the entire row. Similarly, each column can be either all white or all black, but not necessarily filled. But the chips are placed in such a way that any additional chip would violate the row or column condition. So, for example, if in a certain row, some cells are white and others are empty, that's not allowed because if you place a black chip in that row, the row would have both white and black chips, which violates the condition. Similarly, in a column, if some cells are white and others are empty, adding a black chip would violate the column condition
