Okay, so I have this problem about rectangular boxes with a given surface area and volume, and I need to find the radius of the smallest sphere that can contain any of these boxes. Then, I have to express r squared as a fraction p/q where p and q are coprime, and find p+q. Hmm, let's break this down.

First, I know that for a rectangular box, the surface area S is given by 2(lw + lh + wh), where l, w, h are the length, width, and height. The volume V is lwh. The problem says S = 54 and V = 23. So I can write:

2(lw + lh + wh) = 54
lwh = 23

I need to find the minimal sphere that can contain the box. The sphere must touch the box at least at its farthest corners. So the diameter of the sphere must be equal to the space diagonal of the box. The space diagonal d of a box is given by sqrt(l² + w² + h²). Therefore, the radius r is half of that, so r = d/2. Hence, r² = (l² + w² + h²)/4.

So my goal is to minimize r², which is equivalent to minimizing l² + w² + h², given the constraints on surface area and volume. So I need to find the minimum of l² + w² + h² with the constraints 2(lw + lh + wh) = 54 and lwh = 23.

This seems like an optimization problem with constraints. I can use methods from calculus, perhaps Lagrange multipliers, or maybe there's a way to express variables in terms of each other and substitute.

Let me think. Maybe I can express one variable in terms of the others using the volume constraint. Let's say h = 23/(lw). Then I can substitute this into the surface area equation and the expression for l² + w² + h².

So substituting h into surface area:

2(lw + l*(23/(lw)) + w*(23/(lw))) = 54

Simplify this:

2(lw + (23/(w)) + (23/(l))) = 54

Divide both sides by 2:

lw + 23/w + 23/l = 27

Hmm, that's one equation with variables l and w. Now, I also have h expressed in terms of l and w. So, the expression I need to minimize is l² + w² + h², which becomes:

l² + w² + (23/(lw))²

So I have to minimize f(l, w) = l² + w² + (529)/(l²w²) with the constraint g(l, w) = lw + 23/w + 23/l = 27.

This seems a bit complicated, but maybe I can make a substitution to simplify. Let me denote x = l and y = w. Then, the constraint becomes:

xy + 23/y + 23/x = 27

And the function to minimize is:

f(x, y) = x² + y² + (529)/(x²y²)

I wonder if there's symmetry here. If x = y, maybe that could be the case where the minimal occurs, as often symmetry provides extrema.

Assume x = y, then the constraint becomes:

x² + 23/x + 23/x = 27
x² + 46/x = 27

Multiply both sides by x to eliminate denominator:

x³ + 46 = 27x
x³ -27x +46=0

So, we need to solve x³ -27x +46=0. Let me try possible integer roots. Potential roots are factors of 46: ±1, ±2, ±23, ±46.

Testing x=1: 1 -27 +46 = 20 ≠0
x=2: 8 -54 +46= 0 → yes, x=2 is a root.

So factor the polynomial: (x-2)(x² + 2x -23) =0

Set equal to zero, so x=2 or x² +2x -23=0

Using quadratic formula for x² +2x -23=0:

x = [-2 ± sqrt(4 +92)]/2 = [-2 ± sqrt(96)]/2 = [-2 ±4*sqrt(6)]/2 = -1 ±2*sqrt(6)

Since x must be positive (as a length), so x= -1 +2√6≈-1+4.898≈3.898

But wait, let's see if x=2 is a possible solution. If x=y=2, then h=23/(2*2)=23/4=5.75.

Let me check the surface area: 2(2*2 + 2*5.75 + 2*5.75)=2(4 +11.5 +11.5)=2(27)=54. That works.

So when x=y=2, the surface area is 54 and volume is 23. So this is a valid box.

Now, let's compute the space diagonal squared for this box: l² + w² + h²= 4 +4 + (23/4)^2 = 8 + (529/16) = (128 +529)/16=657/16. So r²=657/(16*4)=657/64.

But wait, no. Wait, the space diagonal is sqrt(l² +w² +h²), so r is half of that. Therefore, r² is (l² +w² +h²)/4. So for l=2, w=2, h=23/4:

l² +w² +h²=4 +4 + (23/4)^2=8 + (529/16)= (128 +529)/16=657/16. So r²=657/(16*4)=657/64.

Wait, 16*4 is 64, yes. So 657/64 is r squared. Hmm, but is this the minimal possible?

Wait, maybe there is a box with smaller space diagonal. Because in the case where x=y=2, we get this value, but perhaps when x≠y, the space diagonal is smaller. So perhaps the minimal space diagonal occurs when the box is not a cube but something else.

Alternatively, maybe the minimal occurs when all sides are equal, but in this case, the volume is 23, which isn't a cube number. So the box can't be a cube.

Wait, but when we assumed x=y, we found a valid solution, but is that the minimal? Let's check.

Alternatively, maybe to make the space diagonal minimal, we can use the method of Lagrange multipliers.

Let me set up the function to minimize: f(l, w, h) = l² + w² + h²

Subject to the constraints:

g(l, w, h) = 2(lw + lh + wh) =54

h(l, w, h) = lwh =23

So, we can use Lagrange multipliers with two constraints.

The method involves introducing two multipliers, say λ and μ, and setting up the equations:

∇f = λ∇g + μ∇h

Compute the gradients:

∇f = (2l, 2w, 2h)
∇g = (2(w + h), 2(l + h), 2(l + w))
∇h = (wh, lh, lw)

So, setting up:

2l = λ*2(w + h) + μ*wh   ...(1)
2w = λ*2(l + h) + μ*lh   ...(2)
2h = λ*2(l + w) + μ*lw   ...(3)

We also have the constraints:

2(lw + lh + wh) =54   ...(4)
lwh=23   ...(5)

So, the system of equations is (1)-(3) plus (4) and (5).

This seems a bit complicated, but perhaps we can find relations between l, w, h.

Let me assume that l=w, but not necessarily equal to h.

If l=w, then equations (1) and (2) become the same equation.

So, let l=w=x, h=y.

Then, constraints become:

2(x² + 2xy) =54 → x² + 2xy =27 ...(4a)
x² y=23       ...(5a)

We have to solve for x and y.

From (5a): y=23/(x²)

Substituting into (4a): x² + 2x*(23/(x²))=27

Simplify:

x² + (46/x)=27

Multiply both sides by x:

x³ +46 =27x →x³ -27x +46=0

Wait, this is the same equation we had earlier when assuming x=y=2. So x=2 is a root.

So, when l=w=2, then h=23/(2*2)=23/4=5.75, as before.

So, this gives one critical point. But are there others?

Earlier, when we factored the equation x³ -27x +46=0, we had (x-2)(x² +2x -23)=0, so the other roots are x=(-2 ±sqrt(4 +92))/2= (-2 ±sqrt(96))/2= (-2 ±4*sqrt(6))/2= -1 ±2√6.

Since x must be positive, x= -1 +2√6≈3.898.

So, could this be another critical point? Let's see.

If x= -1 +2√6≈3.898, then y=23/(x²)=23/(( -1 +2√6 )² )

Compute denominator: (-1 +2√6)^2=1 -4√6 + 24=25 -4√6. So y=23/(25 -4√6). Rationalize denominator:

Multiply numerator and denominator by (25 +4√6):

y=23*(25 +4√6)/[(25)^2 - (4√6)^2] =23*(25 +4√6)/(625 - 96)=23*(25 +4√6)/529= (25 +4√6)/23.

So, h=y=(25 +4√6)/23≈something.

But wait, then the space diagonal squared is l² +w² +h²=2x² + y².

x≈3.898, so x²≈15.19. So 2x²≈30.38.

y≈(25 +4*2.449)/23≈(25 +9.796)/23≈34.796/23≈1.513. So y²≈2.289.

So total≈30.38 +2.289≈32.67.

Compare to when x=2: l=w=2, h=5.75.

Then l² + w² +h²=4 +4 +33.0625=37.0625, which is much larger. So, in this case, the space diagonal squared is about 32.67, which is smaller than 37.06. So perhaps the minimal occurs at x= -1 +2√6≈3.898.

But wait, let's compute it exactly.

So x= -1 +2√6.

Compute 2x² + y².

First, x= -1 +2√6.

x²=(1 -4√6 +24)=25 -4√6.

So 2x²=50 -8√6.

y=23/(x²)=23/(25 -4√6)= (23*(25 +4√6))/(25² - (4√6)^2)= (23*(25 +4√6))/(625 -96)= (23*(25 +4√6))/529= (25 +4√6)/23.

y²=(25 +4√6)^2/(23)^2= (625 + 200√6 + 96)/529= (721 +200√6)/529.

So l² +w² +h²=2x² + y²=50 -8√6 + (721 +200√6)/529.

Let me compute this:

Convert 50 and 721/529:

50=50*529/529=26450/529.

So 26450/529 +721/529= (26450 +721)/529=27171/529.

Now the terms with sqrt(6):

-8√6 + (200√6)/529= (-8*529√6 +200√6)/529= [(-4232 +200)√6]/529= (-4032√6)/529.

So total l² +w² +h²= (27171 -4032√6)/529.

Hmm. So the space diagonal squared is this, and then r squared is half of that.

Wait, no. Wait, r squared is (l² +w² +h²)/4.

So r²= (27171 -4032√6)/(4*529)= (27171 -4032√6)/2116.

Wait, but this seems complex. Also, I need to check if this is a minimum.

Wait, but when l and w are equal, we get two possible solutions, one at l=2, another at l= -1 +2√6. However, the one at l=2 gives a larger r², the other gives a smaller r², so maybe the minimal occurs at l= -1 +2√6.

But wait, perhaps even when l≠w, there could be a lower value. So maybe I shouldn't have assumed l=w.

Alternatively, perhaps the minimal occurs when all three variables are equal, but in that case, it's a cube, but a cube with volume 23 would have sides of 23^(1/3), which doesn't satisfy the surface area condition.

Wait, let's check that. For a cube, surface area is 6s², volume s³.

Given surface area=54, so 6s²=54→s²=9→s=3. Then volume would be 27, but we have volume 23, so it's not a cube.

So, the minimal space diagonal might not occur when all sides are equal, but perhaps when two sides are equal, as we considered.

Wait, but in the case where l= -1 +2√6 and w=l, h= (25 +4√6)/23, we get a lower space diagonal squared.

But is that the minimal? Or is there a case where l≠w≠h, giving an even smaller space diagonal?

Alternatively, perhaps we can use the AM-QM inequality or other inequalities.

Wait, the space diagonal squared is l² +w² +h², which we need to minimize under the constraints of surface area and volume.

Alternatively, perhaps we can express l² +w² +h² in terms of the surface area and some other term.

Wait, note that (l + w + h)^2 = l² +w² +h² + 2(lw + lh + wh). We know lw + lh + wh =27, so (l + w + h)^2 = l² +w² +h² + 54. Therefore, l² +w² +h²= (l +w +h)^2 -54.

So to minimize l² +w² +h², we need to minimize (l +w +h)^2. So we can instead minimize l +w +h.

So, the problem reduces to minimizing l +w +h, given lwh=23 and 2(lw + lh + wh)=54.

This might be easier to handle.

So, let me denote S = l +w +h, P = lwh=23, and Q= lw + lh + wh=27.

We need to minimize S, given that Q=27 and P=23.

I think there's a relation between S, Q, and P for positive real numbers l, w, h. Maybe we can use inequalities.

Another approach is to consider the variables l, w, h as the roots of a cubic equation. If l, w, h are roots of x³ - Sx² + Qx - P =0.

So, the cubic equation is x³ - Sx² +27x -23=0.

But I'm not sure if that's helpful here.

Alternatively, perhaps we can use the AM ≥ GM inequality on l, w, h.

But AM would be S/3, and GM is (lwh)^(1/3)=23^(1/3). So AM ≥ GM → S/3 ≥23^(1/3)→ S≥3*23^(1/3)≈3*2.843≈8.529.

But that's a lower bound, but I don't know if it's achievable.

Wait, but in our case, when l=2, w=2, h=23/4=5.75, S=2+2+5.75=9.75.

In the other case, when l= -1 +2√6, w=l, h=(25 +4√6)/23, let's compute S.

l≈3.898, w=3.898, h≈1.513.

So S≈3.898+3.898+1.513≈9.309.

Which is less than 9.75, so it's a better candidate for minimal S.

But is this the minimal? Or can we get even lower?

Wait, let's see. Let me try to see if when l≠w≠h, the sum S can be lower.

Alternatively, perhaps using the method of Lagrange multipliers without assuming l=w.

So, going back to the Lagrange equations.

We have:

2l = λ*2(w + h) + μ*wh ...(1)

2w = λ*2(l + h) + μ*lh ...(2)

2h = λ*2(l + w) + μ*lw ...(3)

We also have the constraints:

2(lw + lh + wh)=54 → lw + lh + wh=27 ...(4)

lwh=23 ...(5)

Let me try to subtract equation (1) and (2):

2l -2w = λ*2(w + h - l - h) + μ(wh - lh)

Simplify:

2(l -w) = λ*2(w - l) + μ h(w - l)

Factor out (w - l):

2(l -w) = (w - l)[2λ - μ h]

Divide both sides by (l -w), which is -(w - l):

2 = 2λ - μ h

Similarly, subtract equation (2) minus equation (3):

2w -2h = λ*2(l + h - l -w) + μ (lh - lw)

Simplify:

2(w - h) = λ*2(h - w) + μ l(h -w)

Factor (h -w):

2(w - h) = (h -w)(2λ - μ l)

Divide both sides by (w - h) = -(h -w):

2 = 2λ - μ l

So, from both subtractions, we have:

2 = 2λ - μ h ...(6)

2 = 2λ - μ l ...(7)

Subtracting (6) and (7):

0 = μ(l - h)

So, either μ=0 or l=h.

If μ=0, then from equation (6): 2=2λ→λ=1.

Then, equations (1): 2l=2(w + h) +0→l =w +h.

Similarly, equation (2): 2w=2(l +h) +0→w =l +h.

But from equation (1), l=w +h, and equation (2), w=l +h. Substituting l from (1) into (2):

w= (w +h) +h→w= w +2h→0=2h→h=0, which is impossible since h>0.

Therefore, μ≠0, so l=h.

So, l=h.

Similarly, from (6) and (7), since l=h, and μ≠0, from equation (6): 2=2λ - μ l.

But since l=h, let me denote l=h=x, and w=y.

So, variables are l=x, w=y, h=x.

Now, the constraints become:

Surface area: 2(lw + lh + wh)=2(xy +x² + yx)=2(2xy +x²)=2x² +4xy=54→x² +2xy=27 ...(4a)

Volume: lwh=x*x*y=x² y=23 ...(5a)

We have to solve for x and y.

From (5a): y=23/(x²)

Substitute into (4a):

x² + 2x*(23/(x²))=27

Simplify:

x² + 46/x =27

Multiply both sides by x:

x³ +46 =27x→x³ -27x +46=0

Which is the same equation as before. So x=2 is a root, and others are x= -1 ±2√6.

Thus, the only possible case is l=h=2 or l=h= -1 +2√6.

So, it seems that the minimal occurs when two sides are equal, either 2 and 2, and the third is 23/4, or when two sides are -1 +2√6 and the third is (25 +4√6)/23.

Wait, but we saw that when l=h= -1 +2√6, the sum S is lower than when l=h=2, so perhaps that's the minimal.

But how do we know that? Because when we tried the case l=h= -1 +2√6, the sum S was about 9.309, which is less than 9.75 when l=h=2.

But is there a case where all three variables are different, giving a lower sum S?

Wait, according to the Lagrange multiplier method, the only critical points occur when two variables are equal (l=h or l=w, etc.) because when we derived the condition, we found that either μ=0 (which leads to a contradiction) or l=h.

Therefore, the minimal must occur when two variables are equal, and the third is different. So, in this problem, the minimal occurs when two sides are equal, and the third is determined accordingly.

Thus, the minimal occurs at l=h= -1 +2√6, w=23/(x²)=23/(25 -4√6)= (25 +4√6)/23 as we computed earlier.

So, compute l² +w² +h²=2x² + y²=2*(25 -4√6) + ( (25 +4√6)^2 )/529.

Wait, let's compute this in exact terms.

x= -1 +2√6, so x²=25 -4√6.

So, 2x²=50 -8√6.

y=23/(x²)=23/(25 -4√6)= (23*(25 +4√6))/(25² - (4√6)^2)=23*(25 +4√6)/(625 - 96)=23*(25 +4√6)/529=(25 +4√6)/23.

Thus, y²=(25 +4√6)^2 / (23)^2= (625 + 200√6 + 96)/529= (721 + 200√6)/529.

So, l² + w² + h²=2x² + y²=(50 -8√6) + (721 +200√6)/529.

To add these, let's express 50 and 721/529:

50=50*529/529=26450/529.

So, 26450/529 +721/529= (26450 +721)/529=27171/529.

Similarly, the terms with sqrt(6):

-8√6 + (200√6)/529= (-8*529√6 +200√6)/529= (-4232√6 +200√6)/529= (-4032√6)/529.

So, l² +w² +h²=27171/529 -4032√6/529.

Therefore, r²=(l² +w² +h²)/4=(27171 -4032√6)/(4*529)= (27171 -4032√6)/2116.

Hmm, that's a bit messy. Let me see if this can be simplified.

Wait, 27171 and 4032, do they have a common factor?

Let me factor 27171: 27171 ÷3=9057, 9057 ÷3=3019, which is a prime? Maybe.

Similarly, 4032 ÷3=1344. So both numerator terms are divisible by 3.

Let me factor out 3:

27171=3*9057=3*3*3019

4032=3*1344

So,

27171 -4032√6=3*(9057 -1344√6)

So,

r²=3*(9057 -1344√6)/2116

But 2116=46²=4*529, and 529=23². So, 2116=4*23².

Thus,

r²=3*(9057 -1344√6)/(4*23²).

But 9057 and 1344, I don't see an obvious common factor. Let me check:

9057 ÷3=3019, which is prime? Maybe.

1344 ÷3=448.

So,

9057 -1344√6=3*(3019 -448√6)

Therefore,

r²=3*3*(3019 -448√6)/(4*23²)=9*(3019 -448√6)/(4*529).

Wait, 3019 and 448, no obvious common factors. So, maybe the fraction is simplified as 9*(3019 -448√6)/(4*529).

But this still doesn't look like a simple fraction. Maybe I made a mistake earlier.

Wait, let's re-express l² +w² +h²=2x² + y².

We have x= -1 +2√6, so x²=25 -4√6.

So, 2x²=50 -8√6.

y= (25 +4√6)/23.

So, y²= (25 +4√6)^2 /23²= (625 +200√6 +96)/529= (721 +200√6)/529.

So, adding 2x² + y²=50 -8√6 + (721 +200√6)/529.

Let me convert 50 and 721 into over 529 denominator:

50=50*529/529=26450/529.

So, 26450 +721=27171.

Now, the sqrt(6) terms:

-8√6 + (200√6)/529.

-8√6= (-8*529√6)/529= (-4232√6)/529.

So, total sqrt(6) term is (-4232√6 +200√6)/529=(-4032√6)/529.

Thus, l² +w² +h²=27171/529 -4032√6/529.

So, r²=(27171 -4032√6)/(4*529)= (27171 -4032√6)/2116.

Wait, perhaps 27171 and 4032 have a common factor. Let me check:

27171 ÷3=9057, 4032 ÷3=1344.

So, 27171 -4032√6=3*(9057 -1344√6).

Thus, r²=3*(9057 -1344√6)/2116.

2116=4*529. 529 is 23², which is prime squared, so no common factors with 3.

Thus, the fraction is (27171 -4032√6)/2116, but perhaps this can be written as (27171/2116) - (4032√6)/2116.

But I don't think this simplifies further. Wait, but the problem says that r² can be written as p/q, where p and q are coprime positive integers. But here, r² has a sqrt(6) term, which is irrational. That can't be expressed as a fraction of integers. So, I must have made a mistake.

Wait a second. That suggests my approach is wrong because r² must be rational. Because the problem states that r²=p/q, implying it's a rational number. So, my earlier approach must have an error.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the assumption that the minimal occurs when two variables are equal. Or perhaps I should take another approach.

Wait, maybe I can express l² +w² +h² in terms of the surface area and volume.

We know that (l +w +h)^2 = l² +w² +h² + 2(lw + lh + wh). So,

l² +w² +h² = (l +w +h)^2 - 2*27 = S² -54.

So, to minimize l² +w² +h², we need to minimize S², which is (l +w +h)^2.

So, we can instead try to minimize S=l +w +h, given that lwh=23 and 2(lw + lh + wh)=54.

So, the problem reduces to minimizing S, given P=23 and Q=27.

I remember that for positive real numbers, the relationship between S, Q, and P is given by the inequality involving symmetric sums.

Alternatively, perhaps using the method of substitution.

Let me consider variables a=l, b=w, c=h.

We have:

a + b + c = S

ab + bc + ca =27

abc=23

We can think of a, b, c as roots of the cubic equation:

x³ - Sx² +27x -23=0.

But I don't know if that helps.

Alternatively, perhaps using the inequality that for positive real numbers, (ab + bc + ca)^3 ≥ 27(a + b + c)(abc)^2.

Wait, let me check that.

Wait, I recall that (ab + bc + ca)^3 ≥ 27abc(a + b + c). Is that true?

Yes, by AM-GM inequality applied to the terms ab, bc, ca.

Indeed, (ab + bc + ca)/3 ≥ (a^2b^2c^2)^(1/3)=abc^(2/3). But maybe that's not directly helpful.

Alternatively, perhaps using the inequality between arithmetic mean and geometric mean on the terms ab, bc, ca.

Wait, AM ≥ GM: (ab + bc + ca)/3 ≥ (a^2b^2c^2)^(1/3)= (abc)^(2/3)=23^(2/3).

So, (27)/3=9 ≥23^(2/3).

Compute 23^(2/3)= (23^(1/3))^2≈(2.843)^2≈8.082.

Indeed, 9 ≥8.082, so that holds.

But I'm not sure how that helps me find the minimal S.

Alternatively, perhaps I can express S in terms of Q and P.

But I don't see a direct relation.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use the method of substituting variables.

Let me denote a = l, b =w, c=h.

We have:

ab + bc + ca=27,

abc=23,

We need to minimize S=a +b +c.

Let me fix c=23/(ab).

Then, ab + a*(23/(ab)) + b*(23/(ab))=27

Simplify:

ab +23/b +23/a=27.

Let me denote x=a, y=b.

Then, xy +23/y +23/x=27.

This is similar to what I had earlier.

So, to minimize S= x + y +23/(xy).

Hmm, this seems a bit complex, but maybe I can set x=y to exploit symmetry.

So, set x=y, then equation becomes:

x² +46/x=27.

Which is the same equation as before, giving x=2 and x= -1 +2√6.

So, we have two critical points when x=y: (2,2,23/4) and (x,y)= (-1 +2√6, -1 +2√6, (25 +4√6)/23).

Which gives the two possible sums S=9.75 and S≈9.309.

But wait, is there a way to get a lower S without assuming x=y?

Alternatively, perhaps to set x≠y and find S even lower.

But since the Lagrange multiplier method led us to the conclusion that two variables must be equal, perhaps those are the only critical points.

Therefore, the minimal S occurs when two variables are equal, and the third is determined.

Thus, the minimal S is achieved when l=h= -1 +2√6, w=(25 +4√6)/23.

So, then l² +w² +h²=2x² + y²= as computed earlier, (27171 -4032√6)/529.

Wait, but this still leads to r²=(27171 -4032√6)/(4*529)= (27171 -4032√6)/2116, which is irrational. But the problem states that r² is a rational number p/q. So I must have done something wrong.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the substitution.

Wait, let's re-examine.

Given l= -1 +2√6, h=l, w=23/(l²).

Compute l²: (-1 +2√6)^2=1 -4√6 +24=25 -4√6.

So, w=23/(25 -4√6). Multiply numerator and denominator by (25 +4√6):

w=23*(25 +4√6)/[(25)^2 - (4√6)^2]=23*(25 +4√6)/(625 -96)=23*(25 +4√6)/529= (25 +4√6)/23.

Thus, w=(25 +4√6)/23.

Now, compute l² +w² +h²=2*(25 -4√6) + [(25 +4√6)/23]^2.

Compute each term:

2*(25 -4√6)=50 -8√6.

[(25 +4√6)/23]^2= (25 +4√6)^2 / (23)^2 = (625 + 200√6 + 96)/529= (721 +200√6)/529.

So, adding 50 -8√6 + (721 +200√6)/529.

Convert 50 to 50*529/529=26450/529.

So, sum is 26450/529 +721/529=27171/529.

And the sqrt(6) terms: (-8√6) + (200√6)/529.

Convert -8√6 to (-8*529√6)/529= (-4232√6)/529.

So, total sqrt(6) term: (-4232√6 +200√6)/529= (-4032√6)/529.

Thus, total l² +w² +h²=27171/529 -4032√6/529.

So, r²=(27171 -4032√6)/(4*529)= (27171 -4032√6)/2116.

But this still includes a sqrt(6) term, which is a problem because r² is supposed to be a rational number. So, clearly, I'm making a mistake here.

Wait, perhaps I miscalculated earlier when substituting.

Wait, when l=h= -1 +2√6, w=(25 +4√6)/23.

Compute l² +w² +h²: 2*(25 -4√6) + ( (25 +4√6)^2 )/(23)^2.

Wait, (25 +4√6)^2 is 625 + 200√6 + 96=721 +200√6.

So, (721 +200√6)/529.

But 2*(25 -4√6)=50 -8√6.

So, adding 50 -8√6 + (721 +200√6)/529.

But 50 is 26450/529, so adding 26450 +721=27171 over 529.

And the sqrt(6) terms: (-8√6) + (200√6)/529.

So, (-8*529√6 +200√6)/529= (-4232√6 +200√6)/529= (-4032√6)/529.

Thus, the total is 27171/529 -4032√6/529.

Wait, but this is (27171 -4032√6)/529.

Then, r² is (l² +w² +h²)/4= (27171 -4032√6)/(4*529)= (27171 -4032√6)/2116.

But this is a problem because the problem states that r² is a rational number p/q.

So, perhaps the minimal occurs not at l=h= -1 +2√6, but at l=2, w=2, h=23/4, giving r²= (4 +4 + (23/4)^2)/4= (8 +529/16)/4= (128/16 +529/16)/4= (657/16)/4=657/64.

Which is a rational number. 657 and 64: 64 is 2^6, 657 ÷3=219, 219 ÷3=73. So 657=3^2 *73, and 64=2^6. They are coprime because 73 is prime and doesn't divide 64. So p=657, q=64, p+q=657+64=721.

But earlier, when I considered l=h= -1 +2√6, the r² had an irrational component, which contradicts the problem statement. So, perhaps that case is invalid, and the minimal occurs at l=w=2, h=23/4.

But why? Because when we considered assuming l=w, we got two critical points, but perhaps only one is valid in terms of the sphere containing the box.

Wait, perhaps in reality, the minimal sphere occurs when the box is axis-aligned with the sphere, and the sphere touches the box's farthest corners. So, the sphere's radius is determined by the space diagonal.

But in the case where two variables are equal and the third is different, the space diagonal is smaller than when all variables are equal.

But in our case, when we have l=2, w=2, h=5.75, the space diagonal is sqrt(4 +4 +33.0625)=sqrt(41.0625)=6.408, radius≈3.204, r²≈10.27.

In the other case, l≈3.898, w≈3.898, h≈1.513, space diagonal≈sqrt(15.19 +15.19 +2.289)=sqrt(32.669)=5.715, radius≈2.857, r²≈8.163.

But 657/64≈10.265625, which is higher than 8.163, but in that case, r² is irrational.

Wait, but the problem says "the radius of the smallest sphere that can contain each of the rectangular boxes that are elements of B".

So, perhaps, in reality, the minimal r² is 657/64≈10.2656, but that's not the minimal possible. So, maybe my earlier conclusion is wrong.

Wait, but the sphere must contain all boxes in B, so it must be large enough to contain any box in B. So, the sphere's radius must be at least as large as the space diagonal of any box in B. So, the radius r is the maximum of space diagonals over all boxes in B. Therefore, we need to find the maximum of the space diagonal of any box in B, and then r is that maximum.

Wait, that changes everything. I misread the problem earlier.

The problem says: "the radius of the smallest sphere that can contain each of the rectangular boxes that are elements of B."

So, the sphere must contain all boxes in B. So, the sphere needs to have a radius large enough to contain any box in B. So, the minimal such radius is the supremum (maximum) of the space diagonals of the boxes in B.

Therefore, I need to find the maximum possible space diagonal among all boxes in B, and that maximum is the minimal r such that the sphere of radius r contains all boxes in B.

Oh, that's a different problem. So, instead of minimizing l² +w² +h², I need to maximize it.

Because the sphere must contain all boxes, even those with the largest space diagonal. Therefore, r must be at least as large as the space diagonal of the "largest" box in B. So, I need to find the maximum of l² +w² +h² given the constraints S=54 and V=23.

So, this changes everything. Earlier, I thought I had to minimize it, but actually, I need to maximize it.

So, to find the maximal space diagonal, which corresponds to the maximal l² +w² +h².

Given 2(lw + lh +wh)=54 and lwh=23.

So, how to approach this.

Again, perhaps using Lagrange multipliers, but this time to maximize f(l, w, h)=l² +w² +h², subject to the same constraints.

Alternatively, perhaps we can express h=23/(lw), and substitute into the surface area.

So, 2(lw + l*(23/(lw)) + w*(23/(lw)))=54.

Simplify:

2(lw +23/w +23/l)=54→lw +23/w +23/l=27.

So, the same constraint as before.

So, f(l, w)= l² +w² + (23/(lw))².

We need to maximize this function under the constraint lw +23/w +23/l=27.

But how?

Again, perhaps assuming symmetry, l=w.

If l=w=x, then h=23/x².

Constraint becomes x² +46/x=27→x³ -27x +46=0, as before.

Solutions are x=2, x=(-1 +2√6), etc.

So, when x=2, f=2² +2² + (23/(2*2))²=4 +4 + (23/4)^2=8 +529/16= (128 +529)/16=657/16.

So, r²=657/(16*4)=657/64≈10.2656.

When x= -1 +2√6≈3.898, f=2x² + (23/(x²))².

Compute x²=25 -4√6.

So, 2x²=50 -8√6.

(23/(x²))²=(23/(25 -4√6))²= [23*(25 +4√6)/529]^2= [ (25 +4√6)/23 ]^2.

Compute (25 +4√6)^2=625 +200√6 +96=721 +200√6.

So, (23/(x²))²=(721 +200√6)/529²= (721 +200√6)/(279841).

Wait, but that seems very small. Wait, no, wait.

Wait, 23/(x²)=23/(25 -4√6)= (23*(25 +4√6))/529= (25 +4√6)/23.

So, (23/(x²))²= (25 +4√6)^2/(23)^2= (721 +200√6)/529.

So, f=2x² + (23/(x²))²=50 -8√6 + (721 +200√6)/529.

Wait, as before, 50=26450/529, so 26450 +721=27171.

And the sqrt(6) terms: -8√6 + (200√6)/529= (-4232√6 +200√6)/529= (-4032√6)/529.

So, f=27171/529 -4032√6/529.

But this is the same as in the previous case, which is approximately 27171/529≈51.23, minus 4032√6/529≈4032*2.449/529≈4032*0.0463≈185.8, so 51.23 -185.8≈-134.57. Wait, that can't be. Because f is a sum of squares, it can't be negative. So, I must have made a miscalculation.

Wait, 27171/529 is 27171 ÷529≈51.23.

4032√6≈4032*2.449≈9883.

So, 4032√6/529≈9883/529≈18.7.

So, 51.23 -18.7≈32.53.

Which is positive.

So, f≈32.53, so r²=32.53/4≈8.13.

Wait, but in this case, when l=w= -1 +2√6, f≈32.53, which is less than when l=w=2, which gave f≈657/16≈41.06.

So, which is the maximum?

Wait, but when l and w are larger, the term l² +w² is larger, but h is smaller, so h² is smaller. So, perhaps the maximal occurs at l=w=2.

Wait, but let's test with l and w not equal.

Alternatively, perhaps the maximum occurs when one of the sides is as large as possible, and the others are as small as possible.

For example, let me consider when one side approaches zero.

But with l approaching zero, then w and h would need to satisfy lwh=23, so w and h would approach infinity, but surface area constraint may not allow that.

Wait, let's see. Suppose l is very small, approaching zero.

Then, surface area becomes 2(lw + lh + wh)≈2(0 +0 + wh)=2wh=54→wh=27.

Volume lwh=23→w*h=23/l≈∞ as l→0. But wh=27, so 27=23/l→l=23/27≈0.851, which is finite. So, l cannot approach zero, because then wh would have to approach infinity, but surface area limits wh to 27.

Wait, no, if l approaches zero, from surface area: 2(lw + lh + wh)≈2(wh)=54→wh=27. So, wh=27.

But volume: lwh=23→w h=23/l.

But if l approaches zero, w h approaches infinity, which contradicts wh=27. Therefore, l cannot approach zero; it must be bounded below.

Similarly, all variables must be bounded.

Therefore, the set B is compact in some sense, so the function f(l, w, h)=l² +w² +h² must attain its maximum on B.

So, the maximum must occur at some point in B.

Earlier, when we considered l=w=2 and l=w= -1 +2√6, we found f=657/16≈41.06 and f≈32.53. So, the first is larger.

But is there a box where f is even larger?

Wait, perhaps when one variable is larger, and the others are smaller.

Wait, perhaps when l is as large as possible, while w and h are as small as possible.

Let me try to set h as small as possible.

Let me set h approaching its minimal possible value.

But h must satisfy lwh=23, so if h is minimal, l or w must be large.

But let's see.

Wait, perhaps when two variables are as small as possible, and the third is as large as possible.

But how small can two variables be? Let's see.

From the surface area: 2(lw + lh + wh)=54.

If l and w are very small, then h must be very large.

But from volume: lwh=23→h=23/(lw). So, if l and w are small, h would be large.

But the surface area would be dominated by 2(lw + lh + wh)=2(lw + l*(23/(lw)) + w*(23/(lw))).

Which is 2(lw +23/w +23/l).

If l and w are small, then 23/w and 23/l would dominate, making the surface area large, but we need surface area=54. So, perhaps l and w can't be too small.

Alternatively, perhaps the maximum occurs when two variables are equal and the third is determined, as in the case l=w=2, h=23/4.

Because in that case, the space diagonal is sqrt(4 +4 + (23/4)^2)=sqrt(41.0625)=6.408, which is a larger space diagonal than when l=3.898, w=3.898, h=1.513.

So, perhaps the maximum occurs at l=w=2, h=23/4, giving f=657/16, and r²=657/64.

So, why did the earlier case with l= -1 +2√6 give a smaller f?

Because I was trying to minimize f, but the problem requires the maximum f, since the sphere must contain all boxes, including the one with the largest space diagonal.

So, the minimal r is determined by the largest space diagonal among all boxes in B.

Thus, the maximum space diagonal occurs when l=w=2, h=23/4, as this gives the largest f=657/16.

Therefore, r squared is 657/(16*4)=657/64.

Simplify, 657 divided by 64. Let's check if 657 and 64 are coprime.

64=2^6.

657 ÷3=219, 219 ÷3=73. So, 657=3^2 *73.

73 is a prime number, which doesn't divide 64. So, 657 and 64 share no common factors besides 1. So, p=657, q=64, p+q=657+64=721.

So, the answer is 721.


To solve the problem, we need to find the radius \( r \) of the smallest sphere that can contain any rectangular box in the set \( \mathcal{B} \), where each box has a surface area of 54 and a volume of 23. The value \( r^2 \) will be expressed as a fraction \( \frac{p}{q} \), and we need to find \( p + q \).

### Key Steps:

1. **Constraints and Objective**:
   - Surface area: \( 2(lw + lh + wh) = 54 \)
   - Volume: \( lwh = 23 \)
   - The sphere must contain all boxes, so \( r \) is determined by the maximum space diagonal of any box in \( \mathcal{B} \).

2. **Space Diagonal**:
   - The space diagonal \( d \) of a box is \( \sqrt{l^2 + w^2 + h^2} \).
   - The radius \( r \) is half the space diagonal: \( r = \frac{d}{2} \), so \( r^2 = \frac{l^2 + w^2 + h^2}{4} \).

3. **Maximizing the Space Diagonal**:
   - To ensure the sphere contains all boxes, we need the maximum \( l^2 + w^2 + h^2 \).
   - Using symmetry, assume \( l = w = x \) and \( h = \frac{23}{x^2} \).
   - Substitute into the surface area constraint: \( x^2 + \frac{46}{x} = 27 \), leading to the cubic equation \( x^3 - 27x + 46 = 0 \).
   - Solutions are \( x = 2 \) and \( x = -1 + 2\sqrt{6} \).

4. **Evaluating Critical Points**:
   - For \( x = 2 \), \( h = \frac{23}{4} \), giving \( l^2 + w^2 + h^2 = 4 + 4 + \left(\frac{23}{4}\right)^2 = \frac{657}{16} \).
   - For \( x = -1 + 2\sqrt{6} \), calculations yield a smaller \( l^2 + w^2 + h^2 \), which is not the maximum.

5. **Conclusion**:
   - The maximum \( l^2 + w^2 + h^2 \) occurs at \( l = w = 2 \) and \( h = \frac{23}{4} \), giving \( r^2 = \frac{657}{64} \).
   - \( p = 657 \) and \( q = 64 \), so \( p + q = 721 \).

### Final Answer:
\[
\boxed{721}
\]
