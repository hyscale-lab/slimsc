Okay, so I've got this problem here about a hyperbola and a rhombus. Let me try to unpack it step by step. The hyperbola is given by the equation x²/20 - y²/24 = 1. Points A, B, C, D are on this hyperbola, and ABCD is a rhombus. The diagonals intersect at the origin, which is probably the center of the hyperbola as well, since the hyperbola is centered at (0,0).

First, I should recall that a rhombus has all sides equal and its diagonals bisect each other at right angles, but wait, no, that's a square. Wait, in a rhombus, the diagonals bisect each other and the angles, but they are not necessarily perpendicular unless it's a square. Wait, no, actually, in a rhombus, the diagonals are not necessarily perpendicular unless it's a square. Hmm, no, wait, actually, in a rhombus, the diagonals are perpendicular. Because that's one of the properties. So, in a rhombus, diagonals bisect each other at right angles. So, that's a key point.

Given that the diagonals intersect at the origin, which is the center. So, the diagonals are straight lines passing through the origin. So, points A and C are endpoints of one diagonal, and B and D are endpoints of the other diagonal. Since the diagonals intersect at the origin, the origin is the midpoint of both diagonals.

So, if A is a point on the hyperbola, then C must be the point such that the midpoint of AC is the origin. So, if A is (x, y), then C would be (-x, -y). Similarly, B and D are points on the hyperbola such that the midpoint of BD is the origin, so if B is (p, q), then D is (-p, -q).

Since ABCD is a rhombus, all sides must be equal. So, the distance from A to B must equal the distance from B to C, which equals the distance from C to D, which equals the distance from D to A.

Alternatively, another approach is to consider the slopes of the diagonals. Since diagonals are perpendicular, their slopes multiply to -1.

Wait, but in this case, since the diagonals are AC and BD. So, the slope of AC times the slope of BD should be -
