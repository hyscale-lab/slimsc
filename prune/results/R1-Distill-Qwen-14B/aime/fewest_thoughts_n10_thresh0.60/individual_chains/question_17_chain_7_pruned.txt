Hmm, okay, so I have this problem here where I need to find the radius squared of the smallest sphere that can contain any rectangular box from the set B. Each box in B has a surface area of 54 and a volume of 23. The answer should be a fraction p/q, where p and q are coprime, and then I need to find p + q. 

Let me start by understanding the problem. A rectangular box has length, width, and height, let's say a, b, and c. The surface area is given by 2(ab + bc + ac) = 54, and the volume is abc = 23. I need to find the smallest sphere that can contain such a box. The sphere's radius will be half the space diagonal of the box because the sphere's diameter must be at least as long as the box's diagonal to contain it.

So, the space diagonal d of the box is sqrt(a² + b² + c²). Therefore, the radius r is d/2. So, r² would be (a² + b² + c²)/4. So, my goal is to minimize r², which is equivalent to minimizing a² + b² + c² given the constraints on surface area and volume.

So, I need to minimize a² + b² + c² subject to 2(ab + bc + ac) = 54 and abc = 23.

I think I can approach this using Lagrange multipliers, but since it's a problem with three variables, maybe I can find a relationship between them using the given constraints.

Let me denote S = a + b + c, P = ab + bc + ac = 27 (since 2P = 54), and Q = abc = 23.

Wait, so S² = a² + b² + c² + 2(ab + bc + ac). So, a² + b² + c² = S² - 2P. Since P is 27, that's S² - 54. So, I need to minimize S² - 54. So, minimizing a² + b² + c² is equivalent to minimizing S².

So, I need to find the minimum value of S² given that (a + b + c)², with the constraints that ab + bc + ac = 27 and abc = 23.

Hmm, this seems like a problem where I can use inequalities. Maybe the AM ≥ GM inequality?

Wait, but since I have three variables, perhaps I can consider using Lagrange multipliers with the two constraints.

Let me set up the function to minimize: f(a, b, c) = a² + b² + c².

Subject to the constraints:
g(a, b, c) = ab + bc + ac = 27,
h(a, b, c) = abc = 23.

Using Lagrange multipliers, I can set up the system where the gradient of f is a linear combination of the gradients of g and h.

So, the gradients:

∇f = (2a, 2b, 2c),
∇g = (b + c, a + c, a + b),
∇h = (bc, ac, ab).

So, according to the method, there exist multipliers λ and μ such that:

2a = λ(b + c) + μ(bc),
2b = λ(a + c) + μ(ac),
2c = λ(a + b) + μ(ab).

Hmm, that's a system of three equations. Since the problem is symmetric in a, b, c, perhaps the minimal configuration occurs when a = b = c? But wait, if a = b = c, then the box is a cube. Let's check if that's possible.

If a = b = c, then the surface area would
