Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the smallest integer base b (where b is at least 2) such that there are more than ten b-eautiful integers. A number n is b-eautiful if, when written in base b, it has exactly two digits, and the sum of those two digits equals the square root of n.

First, let me make sure I understand the problem correctly. So, a number n is b-eautiful if:

1. When n is written in base b, it has exactly two digits. That means n is between b^1 and b^2 - 1, right? Because the smallest two-digit number in base b is b (which is 10_b) and the largest is (b^2 - 1) (which is (b-1)(b-1)_b).

2. The sum of the two digits equals the square root of n. So, if in base b, n is written as "ab"_b, then a + b = sqrt(n). But wait, actually, the digits are a and b, but in base b, the number is a*b + b, right? Wait, no, wait. Let me clarify.

In base b, the two-digit number is written as a followed by b, which translates to a*b + b. Wait, no, that's not quite right. Wait, the first digit is the 'b's place, and the second is the units. So, the number n would be equal to a*b + c, where a and c are digits in base b. So, a can range from 1 to b-1 (since it's the leading digit), and c can range from 0 to b-1.

So, n = a*b + c, and the sum of the digits is a + c = sqrt(n). So, our condition is a + c = sqrt(a*b + c). 

Let me write that equation down:

a + c = sqrt(a*b + c)

If I square both sides to eliminate the square root, I get:

(a + c)^2 = a*b + c

Expanding the left side:

a^2 + 2*a*c + c^2 = a*b + c

Let me rearrange the equation:

a^2 + 2*a*c + c^2 - a*b - c = 0

Hmm, not sure if that helps yet. Maybe I can rearrange terms:

a^2 + (2c - b)*a + (c^2 - c) = 0

That's a quadratic equation in terms of a. Let me write it as:

a^2 + (2c - b)a + (c^2 - c) = 0

Since a must be an integer between 1 and b-1, the discriminant of this quadratic must be a perfect square. The discriminant D is:

D = (2c - b)^2 - 4*(1)*(c^2 - c)

Let me compute that:

D = (4c^2 - 4b c + b^2) - 4c^2 + 4c

Simplify:

D = 4c^2 -4b c + b^2 -4c^2 +4c

The 4c^2 terms cancel out:

D = (-4b c + b^2) +4c

Factor:

D = b^2 -4b c +4c

Hmm, this can be rewritten as:

D = b^2 - (4c)(b - 1)

Wait, maybe not. Alternatively, factor terms with c:

D = b^2 + c*(-4b +4)

Hmm, perhaps that's not helpful. Alternatively:

D = b^2 -4c(b -1) 

That might be a useful expression.

Since D has to be a perfect square for a to be an integer, let me denote D = k^2, where k is some integer.

So:

k^2 = b^2 -4c(b -1)

But I need to find a and c such that this holds, with a and c being digits in base b. So, a is from 1 to b-1, c is from 0 to b-1.

Wait, maybe I can approach this differently. Let me consider that n = a*b + c, and sqrt(n) = a + c.

So, sqrt(n) is equal to a + c, which is an integer because a and c are integers. Therefore, n must be a perfect square. So, n = (a + c)^2.

So, (a + c)^2 = a*b + c.

Expanding:

a^2 + 2 a c + c^2 = a b + c

Rearranging:

a^2 + 2 a c + c^2 - a b - c = 0

Which is the same equation as before.

Hmm, perhaps I can consider this as a quadratic in a:

a^2 + (2c - b) a + (c^2 - c) = 0

Solving for a using quadratic formula:

a = [ -(2c - b) Â± sqrt(D) ] / 2

Where D is discriminant, which is (2c - b)^2 - 4*(c^2 - c)

Which we previously found as D = b^2 -4c(b -1)
