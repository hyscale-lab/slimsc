Okay, so I'm trying to solve this geometry problem. Let me parse the problem first.

We have triangle ABC inscribed in a circle ω. The tangents to ω at points B and C intersect at point D. Then, the line AD intersects ω again at point P. We're given the lengths AB = 5, BC = 9, and AC = 10. We need to find AP, express it as a reduced fraction m/n, and then find m + n.

Hmm, okay. So, I think the first step is to visualize the problem or maybe draw a rough sketch. Although there's an Asymptote code provided, which I can try to imagine. Let me list down what's given:

1. Triangle ABC with sides AB=5, BC=9, AC=10.
2. Circle ω is the circumcircle of ABC.
3. Tangents at B and C meet at D.
4. Line AD intersects ω again at P.
5. Find AP.

I need to find AP. So, perhaps I can use properties related to circles, tangents, and intersecting chords or something like that.

First, let me recall some important concepts.

1. The tangent to a circle is perpendicular to the radius at the point of contact. So, the tangent at B is perpendicular to OB, where O is the center of ω. Similarly, the tangent at C is perpendicular to OC.

2. The point D is the intersection of the two tangents, so D lies outside the circle ω, and DB and DC are tangent segments from D to ω.

3. There's a theorem related to the power of a point. The power of point D with respect to ω is equal to DB² = DC², and it's also equal to DA * DP, because AD is a secant from D passing through A and P.

Wait, that might be useful. Let me write that down.

Power of point D: DB² = DA * DP.

So, if I can find DB, and DA, then I can find DP, and since AP = DP - DA (or the other way, depending on the position), I can find AP.

But wait, let's think about the positions. Point A is on the circle, so DA is a line from D passing through A and intersecting the circle again at P. So, DA is from D to A, then from A to P. So, the length DA is from D to A, and DP is from D to P. So, DP = DA + AP. Wait no, because P is on the circle beyond A from D, so the order is D --- A --- P on line AD. So, DA is the segment from D to A, and DP is from D to P, which is longer. So, DP = DA + AP. Therefore, AP = DP - DA.

So, from power of a point, we have DB² = DA * DP.

So, if I can find DB and DA, I can express DP in terms of DA and then solve for DA, which would give me AP.

But wait, do I know where D is? It's the intersection of the two tangents at B and C. So, D is the ex-pole of BC with respect to circle ω. Or,
