Okay, so I have this problem about a hyperbola and a rhombus. Let me try to understand what's being asked here. The hyperbola is given by the equation x²/20 - y²/24 = 1. Points A, B, C, D lie on this hyperbola, forming a rhombus ABCD. The diagonals of this rhombus intersect at the origin. I need to find the greatest real number that is less than BD² for all such rhombi. Basically, I'm looking for the infimum of BD², the lower bound for BD squared, across all possible rhombuses that satisfy the given conditions.

Hmm, okay. So first, I should recall some properties of rhombuses. In a rhombus, all sides are equal, and the diagonals bisect each other at right angles. Wait, no, they bisect each other but not necessarily at right angles unless it's a square. Wait, no, actually in a rhombus, the diagonals bisect each other at right angles. Right, that's a key property. So in this case, the diagonals AC and BD intersect at the origin, and they are perpendicular to each other.

Wait, but if the diagonals intersect at the origin, then the origin is the midpoint of both diagonals. So that means points A and C are symmetric with respect to the origin, and similarly, points B and D are symmetric with respect to the origin.

So, if point A is (x, y), then point C must be (-x, -y). Similarly, if point B is (p, q), then point D must be (-p, -q).

Since ABCD is a rhombus, all four sides are equal. So, the distance from A to B must equal the distance from B to C, which equals the distance from C to D, which equals the distance from D to A.

But maybe a better approach is to consider the properties of the rhombus in terms of vectors. Let me think about that.

Let me denote vectors OA, OB, OC, OD, where O is the origin. Since the diagonals bisect each other, OA + OC = 0 and OB + OD = 0, so OC = -OA and OD = -OB. So, points C and D are just the negatives of A and B, respectively.

In a rhombus, the diagonals are perpendicular. So, the vectors AC and BD should be perpendicular. Wait,
