Okay, so I'm trying to solve this problem where I need to find the smallest base b (where b is at least 2) such that there are more than ten b-eautiful integers. 

First, let me make sure I understand what a b-eautiful number is. The problem says a positive integer n is b-eautiful if when you write it in base b, it has exactly two digits, and the sum of those two digits equals the square root of n.

Hmm, okay. So, in base b, a two-digit number would be something like ab_b, right? Where a is the first digit and b is the base. Wait, no, actually, in base notation, a two-digit number is written as 'a' followed by 'd', so it's a * b + d. So, n = a*b + d, where a and d are digits in base b. But since it's a two-digit number, a can't be zero, and both a and d have to be less than b. So, a is at least 1 and less than b, and d is between 0 and b-1, inclusive.

Also, the sum of the digits, which is a + d, should equal sqrt(n). So, sqrt(n) = a + d.

So, putting it together, n is a two-digit number in base b, which is n = a*b + d. And also, sqrt(n) = a + d.

So, we can write that sqrt(n) = a + d, which implies that n = (a + d)^2.

But also, n = a*b + d.

So, setting them equal: (a + d)^2 = a*b + d.

Let me write that down: (a + d)^2 = a*b + d.

Hmm, maybe we can rearrange this equation. Let's expand the left side:

a² + 2ad + d² = a*b + d.

Let me bring everything to one side:

a² + 2ad + d² - a*b - d = 0.

Hmm, maybe factor terms with a and terms with d:

a² + (2d - b)*a + (d² - d) = 0.

This is a quadratic equation in terms of a, but since a and d are digits in base b, they are integers with a ≥ 1, a < b, and d < b.

Alternatively, maybe we can solve for b in terms of a and d. Let's see.

From (a + d)^2 = a*b + d, we can solve for b:

b = [(a + d)^2 - d] / a.

Simplify numerator: (a + d)^2 - d = a² + 2ad + d² - d.

So, b = (a² + 2ad + d² - d)/a.

We can break this down:

b = a + 2d + (d² - d)/a.

Since b has to be an integer, the term (d² - d)/a must be an integer. So, (d² - d) must be divisible by a.

But a is a positive integer, so a must divide (d² - d).

So, a | (d² - d) => a | d(d - 1).

Given that a and d are digits in base b, a is at least 1, and d is between 0 and b-1.

But also, since n is a two-digit number in base b, a must be less than b, and d must be less than b.

So, perhaps for each possible a and d, we can compute b and check whether b is an integer greater than or equal to the maximum of a and d + 1, because b must be larger than both a and d (since a and d are digits).

Wait, but d can be up to b-1, so if d is at least a, then b must be greater than d
