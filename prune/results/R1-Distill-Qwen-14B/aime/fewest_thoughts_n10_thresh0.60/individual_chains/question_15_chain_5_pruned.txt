Okay, so I have this math problem about counting paths on an 8x8 grid. The paths need to be of length 16, which makes sense because from the lower left to the upper right on an 8x8 grid, you have to move 8 steps right and 8 steps up, totaling 16 steps. The problem specifies that the paths should change direction exactly four times. Hmm, that's interesting.

First, I need to understand what it means for a path to change direction. In a grid, you can only move either right or up. So, each time you switch from moving right to up or from up to right, that's a direction change. For example, if you start by moving right for a few steps, then switch to up for some steps, then right again, and so on—that's changing directions.

The problem says exactly four direction changes. So, let's think about how that translates into segments of right and up moves. Each direction change marks the end of one segment and the start of another. So, if I have four direction changes, that would divide the path into five segments. Wait, no—hold on. Let me think again. If you change direction once, you have two segments. Like, going right then up. So, for four direction changes, you have five segments in total. That makes sense because each change adds a new segment.

So, each path with exactly four direction changes will consist of five segments. These segments alternate between right and up. Since the path starts at the lower left corner, the first segment must be either right or up. But on an 8x8 grid, the path must end at the upper right corner, so the last segment must be either right or up, depending on the starting direction.

Wait, but actually, regardless of the starting direction, the path must have an equal number of right and up moves because it's an 8x8 grid. So, the total right steps are 8 and the total up steps are 8. Therefore, if the path starts with right, then alternates, the number of right and up segments must be determined.

Let me get this straight. Since there are four direction changes, there are five segments. If the path starts with a right segment, then the segments will be right, up, right, up, right, up, right, up, right, up—wait, no. Wait, five segments. So, starting with right, the segments would be right, up, right, up, right. Or wait, nope. Wait, each direction change switches between right and up. So starting with right, then up, then right, then up, then right—so that's three right segments and two up segments. Alternatively, if starting with up, it would be up, right, up, right, up—three up segments and two right segments. But since we need a total of 8 right and 8 up steps, let's see.

If starting with right: the number of right segments is three, and up segments is two. So, the total right steps would be the sum of the lengths of the three right segments, and similarly for up. So, if the right segments sum to 8, and the up segments sum to 8, but we have three right segments and two up segments. Similarly, if starting with up, we'd have three up segments and two right segments.

Wait, let's formalize this. Let’s say the path starts with right. Then the number of right segments is (number of direction changes +1)/2 if starting with right. Wait, no. Let me think in terms of direction changes. Each time you change direction, you switch between right and up. So, if you start with right, then each direction change alternates the direction. So, number of right segments is (number of direction changes + 1) / 2 if starting with right. Wait, let's see: four direction changes. Starting with right, the sequence is right, up, right, up, right. So, that's three right segments and two up segments. So, total right segments = (4 +1 +1)/2 = 3, and up segments = (4 +1)/2 = 2.5? Wait, that can't be right. Alternatively, perhaps it's ceiling(n+1)/2 if starting with right.

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to model it as: for four direction changes, the number of segments is five. If the first segment is right, then the segments alternate right, up, right, up, right. So, three right segments and two up segments. Similarly, if starting with up, it would be three up segments and two right segments.

Since the total number of right moves is 8 and up moves is 8, the sum of the lengths of the right segments must be 8, and the sum of the lengths of the up segments must be 8.

So, whether starting with right or up, we have either three right segments and two up segments, or three up segments and two right segments.

But since the grid is symmetric, the number of paths starting with right and having four direction changes is equal to those starting with up. So, perhaps we can compute the number for one case and double it.

Wait, but if we start with right and have four direction changes, we end with a right segment. But in an 8x8 grid, the last step must be either up or right? Actually, no. The path starts at (0,0) and ends at (8,8). So, the last segment must be either right or up. So, if starting with right and ending with right, that's possible if the number of direction changes is even? Wait, four direction changes, so starting with right and ending with right would require an even number of direction changes. Let me think.

Wait, number of direction changes is four, which is even. So, starting with right, each direction change flips the direction, so after four changes, we end up with the same direction as the starting one. So, starting with right, ending with right. Similarly, starting with up, ending with up. So, in both cases, the last segment is of the same direction as the first.

Therefore, regardless of starting direction, the number of segments of each direction is either three right and two up, or three up and two right.

But wait, if we start with right, and have four direction changes, we end with right. So, the number of right segments is (4/2 +1) = 3, and up segments is 2. Similarly, starting with up, same logic.

So, let's proceed with the case where we start with right. Then, we have three right segments and two up segments. Each right segment has a certain number of steps, and each up segment has a certain number of steps. The sum of all right steps is 8, and the sum of all up steps is 8.

So, the problem reduces to finding the number of ways to partition 8 steps into three right segments, each at least 1 step, and 8 steps into two up segments, each at least 1 step. Then, the number of such partitions would give us the number of paths starting with right. Since the starting direction can be either right or up, we can compute one and multiply by two, but wait, no. Because if the starting direction is up, the number of right segments would be two and up segments three. So, let me make it clear.

Case 1: Starting with right.

Number ofOkay, so I have this problem about counting the number of paths on an 8x8 grid. The paths go from the lower left corner to the upper right corner, and they have a length of 16. The catch is that these paths must change direction exactly four times. Hmm, okay.

Let me visualize an 8x8 grid. So, it's like a chessboard with 8 rows and 8 columns, right? The lower left corner is (0,0) and the upper right corner is (8,8). A path from (0,0) to (8,8) on this grid would consist of moving right and up steps. Since it's an 8x8 grid, to get from one corner to the other, you have to move 8 steps to the right and 8 steps up. So the total number of steps is 16, which makes sense.

Now, the problem says the paths change direction exactly four times. I need to figure out what that means. So, a path can be thought of as a sequence of moves, either right (R) or up (U). Each time the direction changes, the path switches from R to U or U to R. So, for example, a path that goes RRRUUURRUU would change direction a few times.

Wait, but how does changing direction relate to the number of turns? Let me think. Each time the direction changes, it's like making a turn. So, if a path has four direction changes, that means it makes four turns. So, starting from the initial direction, each turn switches the direction.

But wait, the initial direction can
