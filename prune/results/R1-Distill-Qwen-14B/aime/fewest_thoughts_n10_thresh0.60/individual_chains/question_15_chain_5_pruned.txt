Okay, so I have this problem about counting the number of paths on an 8x8 grid. The paths start at the lower left corner and go to the upper right corner, and they have exactly four direction changes. Each path is of length 16, which makes sense because an 8x8 grid has 8 rows and 8 columns, so moving from one corner to the opposite requires 8 right and 8 up moves. That's 16 moves in total.

Hmm, direction changes. So, I think direction changes happen when the path switches from moving right to up or from up to right. Each time it switches, that's one direction change. So, the problem is asking for the number of such paths that change direction exactly four times.

Wait, so if a path changes direction four times, how many segments does it have? Well, each direction change marks the end of one segment and the start of another. So, the number of segments is one more than the number of direction changes. So, four direction changes mean the path has five segments.

Each segment is a straight line, either all right or all up. So, the path will consist of five straight lines, alternating between right and up. Since it's starting at the lower left, the first move is either right or up, but on a grid from lower left to upper right, the first move is typically right along the bottom or up along the left side. But wait, the problem doesn't specify whether the path can go either way initially. Hmm, maybe it can start with either direction.

Wait, but in the examples, I think they showed paths that change direction four times. So, perhaps each direction change alternates between right and up. So, the path would have a sequence like right, up, right, up, right, etc., depending on the number of segments.

But I need to think about the structure of these paths. Let's break it down.

If there are five segments, each segment is a straight line either to the right or up. The path must consist of these five segments, each of which is entirely right or entirely up, and each segment alternates direction from the previous one.

Wait, does it alternate? Or can it have consecutive same directions? Hmm, no, because a direction change is when it switches. So, if it changes direction four times, that means it alternates direction each time after the first segment.

Wait, no. Because if you have four direction changes, you can have, for example, right, up, right, up, right. That's four direction changes, five segments. Or right, up, up, right, up. Wait, no, because that would have only three direction changes: right to up, then up to up (no change), up to right (second change), right to up (third change). So, that's three changes, not four. So, that's not allowed.

So, each time, after a direction change, the direction must switch. So, the path alternates between right and up on each segment. So, if the first segment is right, the next must be up, then right, then up, then right, etc. Or if it starts with up, then right, then up, etc.

So, the path must alternate directions each time, with no two consecutive same directions. That makes sense because each change of direction is a switch.

Therefore, the number of direction changes is four, so the number of segments is five. And the segments alternate between right and up.

So, the path has five segments, each being right or up, alternating. So, if it starts with right, the directions are right, up, right, up, right. If it starts with up, then up, right, up, right, up.

So, each path is a sequence of five segments, each either right or up, alternating, starting with either right or up.

Now, the entire path has to go from (0,0) to (8,8). So, the total right moves must sum to 8, and the total up moves must sum to 8.

Each segment is a consecutive number of right or up moves. So, each segment is a certain number of steps in one direction, with no change in direction until the end of the segment.

So, for a path starting with right, the segments would be: R1, U1, R2, U2, R3, where R1, R2, R3 are the lengths of the right segments, and U1, U2 are the lengths of the up segments. Similarly, if it starts with up, then U1, R1, U2, R2, U3, with U1+U2+U3=8 and R1+R2=8.

Wait, no. Since there are five segments, if starting with right, the sequence is R1, U1, R2, U2, R3. So, R1 + R2 + R3 = 8 (total right steps) and U1 + U2 = 8 (total up steps). Similarly, if starting with up, the segments would be U1, R1, U2, R2, U3, so U1 + U2 + U3 =8, R1 + R2=8.

Ah, so depending on whether the path starts with right or up, the number of up and right segments differs.

Wait, no. Wait, if the path alternates, starting with right, then the number of right segments is one more than the number of up segments. Because it starts with right and ends with right, since there are five segments. So, right, up, right, up, right. So, three right segments and two up segments.

Similarly, if starting with up, the number of up segments is three and right segments is two.

So, in both cases, the number of up and right segments depends on the starting direction.

So, for the starting direction, we have two cases: starting right or starting up.

So,
