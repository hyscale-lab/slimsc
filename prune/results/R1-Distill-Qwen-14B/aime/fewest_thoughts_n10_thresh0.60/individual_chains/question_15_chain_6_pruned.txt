Okay, so I've got this problem about counting paths on an 8x8 grid. The paths are from the lower left corner to the upper right corner, and they have a length of 16. I need to find how many such paths change direction exactly four times. Hmm, okay, let's break this down.

First, I remember that on a grid, moving from one corner to the opposite usually involves moving right and up. For an 8x8 grid, going from lower left to upper right means moving 8 steps to the right (east) and 8 steps up (north). So, the total number of steps is 16, which matches the length given in the problem.

Normally, without any restrictions on direction changes, the number of paths is the combination of 16 steps taken 8 at a time for one direction, so C(16,8). But here, we're supposed to count only those paths that change direction exactly four times.

Wait, direction changes. So, each time the path switches from moving right to up or up to right, that's a direction change. So, for example, if you go right a few times, then up a few times, then right again, that's two direction changes.

I think the problem is similar to counting the number of lattice paths with a specified number of turns. I remember something about breaking the path into segments. Each segment is a straight line either to the right or up. So, each direction change corresponds to the start of a new segment.

If the path changes direction exactly four times, how does that split the path into segments? Well, each direction change would add a new segment. Starting from the first step, each change adds a new segment. So, four direction changes would create five segments. Because the first segment is the initial direction, and each change adds another.

Wait, let me think. If I have a path that starts with right, then changes to up, that's one direction change, and now two segments. Another change would be right again, that's two changes and three segments. So, yeah, four changes would result in five segments.

Each segment is a straight line either right or up. So, each segment must consist of at least one step. So, we have five segments, each moving either right or up, alternately. Because direction changes between right and up each time.

So, the path alternates between right and up segments, starting with either right or
