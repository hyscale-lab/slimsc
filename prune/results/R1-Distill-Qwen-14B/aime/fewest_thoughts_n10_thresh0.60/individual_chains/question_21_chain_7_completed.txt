Okay, let me try to figure out this problem. So, the question is about finding the smallest integer base b (where b is at least 2) such that there are more than ten b-eautiful integers. 

First, I need to make sure I understand what a b-eautiful number is. The problem says that a positive integer n is b-eautiful if two conditions are met: 

1. When n is expressed in base b, it has exactly two digits.
2. The sum of these two digits equals the square root of n.

The example given is 81 being 13-eautiful because in base 13, 81 is written as 63, and 6 + 3 equals 9, which is the square root of 81.

So, to approach this, I think I should first express n in base b. Since it's a two-digit number in base b, n can be written as a * b + c, where a and c are the digits. Importantly, in any base b, the digits a and c must satisfy 0 ≤ a, c < b. Also, since it's a two-digit number, a can't be zero. So, a is at least 1 and less than b, and c is at least 0 and less than b.

The second condition is that the sum of the digits a + c equals sqrt(n). So, putting it all together, we have:

n = a * b + c  
sqrt(n) = a + c

So, substituting the first equation into the second, we get:

sqrt(a * b + c) = a + c

Let me square both sides to eliminate the square root:

a * b + c = (a + c)^2

Expanding the right side:

a * b + c = a² + 2ac + c²

Let me rearrange this equation:

a² + 2ac + c² - a * b - c = 0

Hmm, that's a quadratic in terms of a and c. Maybe I can rearrange the terms to group similar variables.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to express this as:

a² + (2c - b)a + (c² - c) = 0

Yes, that's a quadratic equation in terms of a. Let me write it like that:

a² + (2c - b)a + (c² - c) = 0

Since a is an integer (it's a digit in base b), the discriminant of this quadratic equation must be a perfect square. The discriminant D is given by:

D = (2c - b)^2 - 4 * 1 * (c² - c)

Let me compute that:

D = (4c² - 4bc + b²) - 4c² + 4c  
= 4c² -4bc + b² -4c² +4c  
= (-4bc + b²) + (4c)  
= b² -4bc +4c

Hmm, so D = b² -4bc +4c. For a to be integer, D must be a perfect square.

Alternatively, let's see if we can factor or simplify this expression:

D = b² -4bc +4c  
= b² -4c(b -1)

Wait, not sure if that helps much. Maybe I can factor it as:

D = b² -4c(b -1)

But I'm not sure if that's helpful. Alternatively, perhaps I can factor out a 4c:

But 4c is not a factor of b². Hmm.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think in terms of variables.

So, for each base b, I need to find all possible a and c such that:

1. a is between 1 and b-1 (since it's the first digit of a two-digit number in base b)
2. c is between 0 and b-1
3. The quadratic equation in a has integer solutions for a, given c.

Alternatively, maybe we can approach the problem by considering that for each base b, the number of b-eautiful numbers is equal to the number of pairs (a, c) that satisfy the above conditions.

So, the plan is:

For each base b starting from 2 upwards, find all pairs (a, c) such that:

- 1 ≤ a < b
- 0 ≤ c < b
- a² + (2c - b)a + (c² - c) = 0

And count how many such pairs exist for each b. We need to find the smallest b where this count exceeds 10.

Alternatively, perhaps we can find a relationship between a and c that allows us to parameterize the solutions or find a way to count them.

Let me go back to the original equation:

sqrt(n) = a + c  
n = a*b + c  
So, (a + c)^2 = a*b + c

Expanding:

a² + 2ac + c² = a*b + c  
a² + 2ac + c² - a*b - c = 0

Rearranged:

a² + (2c - b)a + (c² - c) = 0

This is a quadratic in a. For a to be an integer, the discriminant must be a perfect square.

So discriminant D = (2c - b)^2 - 4*(1)*(c² - c)

Compute D:

(2c - b)^2 = 4c² -4bc + b²  
4*(c² - c) = 4c² -4c  
So, D = (4c² -4bc + b²) - (4c² -4c) = 4c² -4bc +b² -4c² +4c = -4bc +b² +4c

So D = b² -4bc +4c

This must be a perfect square, say k².

So, b² -4bc +4c = k²

Let me factor this:

b² -4bc +4c = k²  
b² -4c(b -1) = k²

Hmm, perhaps I can write this as:

b² - k² = 4c(b -1)

Then, (b -k)(b +k) = 4c(b -1)

So, the product of (b -k) and (b +k) must equal 4c(b -1).

Since c is a digit in base b (so c < b), and 4c(b -1) is positive because b ≥ 2, c ≥ 0.

So, (b -k) and (b +k) are both positive integers because b > k (since b² > k², because D is positive? Wait, actually D must be positive for real solutions, so yes, b² -4bc +4c must be positive.

Wait, but 4c(b -1) must equal (b -k)(b +k). Since b and k are positive integers, with b > k.

So, 4c(b -1) must be equal to (b -k)(b +k). Since (b -k) and (b +k) are both positive integers and factors of 4c(b -1).

Furthermore, since (b -k) and (b +k) are both factors of 4c(b -1), and (b +k) > (b -k), and both have the same parity because (b +k) + (b -k) = 2b, which is even, so both are either even or both are odd. But since 4c(b-1) is divisible by 4 (if c is at least 1, but if c is 0, then 4c(b-1)=0, which would require k=0, but then n = a*b +0 = a*b, and a +0 = sqrt(a*b). So a² = a*b, which implies a = b. But a must be less than b, so c=0 is not possible except when a=0, which isn't allowed. So, c must be at least 1, so 4c(b-1) is at least 4*(1)*(b-1) = 4(b-1). So, b > k.

So, we can think of (b -k) and (b +k) as factors of 4c(b -1), such that:

(b -k)(b +k) = 4c(b -1)

Let me denote m = b -k and n = b +k, so that m * n = 4c(b -1). Also, since m and n are positive integers with m < n and m + n = 2b, and n - m = 2k.

So, m and n are factors of 4c(b -1) such that m < n, m*n = 4c(b -1), and m + n is even (since 2b is even). Hmm.

But perhaps this approach is getting a bit complicated. Maybe I can think in terms of expressing c in terms of b and k.

From the equation:

b² -4bc +4c = k²  
=> 4c(b -1) = b² -k²  
=> c = (b² -k²)/(4(b -1))

Since c must be an integer between 1 and b-1, (b² -k²) must be divisible by 4(b -1).

Let me compute (b² -k²) = (b -k)(b +k). So,

c = (b -k)(b +k) / [4(b -1)]

So, c must be integer, so 4(b -1) must divide (b -k)(b +k).

So, 4(b -1) | (b -k)(b +k)

Let me note that b and k are positive integers with b > k.

So, perhaps I can write (b -k)(b +k) as:

= (b -k)(b +k)  
= b² - k²

We know this is equal to 4c(b -1). So,

c = (b² - k²)/(4(b -1))

So, for c to be an integer, (b² -k²) must be divisible by 4(b -1).

Let me factor (b² - k²) as (b -k)(b +k). So,

c = (b -k)(b +k)/(4(b -1))

Since b -k and b +k are two factors, and 4(b -1) is the denominator, perhaps I can find conditions under which this fraction is integer.

Alternatively, perhaps I can write b -1 as (b -k) + (k -1). Hmm, not sure.

Alternatively, let's see if b -k and b +k have any common factors with (b -1). 

Let me compute the greatest common divisor (gcd) of (b -k) and (b -1). Let d = gcd(b -k, b -1). Then d divides (b -k) and (b -1), so d divides their difference, which is (b -k) - (b -1) = 1 -k. Hmm, not sure if that helps.

Alternatively, perhaps I can set t = b -1. Then, b = t + 1. Let's substitute that into the equation.

So, c = ( (t+1)^2 - k^2 ) / (4t )

Expanding (t+1)^2:

= (t² + 2t + 1 - k²) / (4t )

= [ (t² - k²) + 2t + 1 ] / (4t )

Hmm, not sure that's helpful.

Alternatively, perhaps I can express (b² - k²) as b² - k² = (b -k)(b +k) = 4c(b -1). So, 4c(b -1) must be equal to (b -k)(b +k). 

Since 4c(b -1) is equal to the product of (b -k) and (b +k), which are two factors that differ by 2k.

So, perhaps I can think of (b -k) and (b +k) as two factors of 4c(b -1) such that their product is 4c(b -1) and their difference is 2k.

Hmm, but I'm not sure how to proceed from here. Maybe let's try some small values of b and see if we can find a pattern.

Wait, but the question is asking for the smallest b where there are more than ten b-eautiful numbers. So, for each b, we have to find how many pairs (a, c) satisfy the equation. And when that count exceeds ten, we have our answer.

But since the problem is asking for the minimal b where this count is more than ten, perhaps we can try to find for each b, the number of solutions (a, c), and find when this number exceeds ten.

Alternatively, perhaps there's a formula that can give the number of solutions for each b.

But perhaps it's better to think in terms of the equation:

sqrt(n) = a + c  
n = a*b + c

So, (a + c)^2 = a*b + c  
a² + 2ac + c² = a b + c  
a² + (2c - b) a + (c² - c) = 0

This is a quadratic equation in a. The solutions are:

a = [ -(2c - b) ± sqrt(D) ] / 2

Where D is the discriminant:

D = (2c - b)^2 - 4*(c² - c)  
= 4c² -4bc +b² -4c² +4c  
= b² -4bc +4c

Which must be a perfect square, say k². So,

b² -4bc +4c = k²  
Which I can write as:

b² -4c(b -1) = k²

Hmm, perhaps we can consider that for each base b, the number of solutions (a, c) is the number of c's such that b² -4c(b -1) is a perfect square, and the corresponding a is an integer between 1 and b-1.

So, for each c in 1 to b-1, compute D = b² -4c(b -1) and check if D is a perfect square, and then compute a from the quadratic formula and check if it's integer and within the required range.

But since for each b, this would involve checking c from 1 to b-1, it's computationally intensive, especially since we need to find the minimal b where the count exceeds 10. It might require checking b's incrementally until we find such a base.

Alternatively, perhaps we can find a way to parameterize the solutions.

Wait, perhaps I can express this as:

Let me denote m = b -k. Then,

From (b -k)(b +k) = 4c(b -1), so:

m*(2b -m) = 4c(b -1)

Because b +k = 2b - (b -k) = 2b - m.

So,

m*(2b -m) = 4c(b -1)

This gives:

c = [ m*(2b -m) ] / [4(b -1) ]

Since c must be an integer between 1 and b-1, the numerator must be divisible by 4(b -1). So,

m*(2b - m) must be divisible by 4(b -1).

Also, m must be a positive integer less than b, because m = b -k and k is positive, so m < b.

So, m can range from 1 to b-1.

But this approach may not be simplifying the problem much. Maybe it's better to think about the equation in terms of c.

Let me rearrange the equation:

b² -4bc +4c = k²  
=> b² + (4c -4b c) = k²  
Wait, that doesn't seem helpful.

Alternatively, perhaps I can express it as:

b² -4c(b -1) = k²  
So,

b² -k² =4c(b -1)

Which can be written as:

(b -k)(b +k) =4c(b -1)

Since (b -k) and (b +k) are factors of 4c(b -1), and their product is 4c(b -1). Also, since b > k, both (b -k) and (b +k) are positive integers.

Furthermore, (b -k) and (b +k) have the same parity because their sum and difference are both even (since (b +k) + (b -k) = 2b, which is even, and (b +k) - (b -k) = 2k, which is even). So, both are even or both are odd.

But since 4c(b -1) is a multiple of 4 (since c is at least 1, as we saw earlier), both (b -k) and (b +k) must be even. Because if their product is divisible by 4, and they have the same parity, then both must be even. Because if both are odd, their product would be odd, which is not divisible by 4. So, both (b -k) and (b +k) are even numbers.

So, let me write (b -k) = 2m and (b +k) = 2n, where m and n are positive integers with n > m.

Then, their product is:

(2m)(2n) =4mn =4c(b -1)

So, 4mn =4c(b -1)  
=> mn = c(b -1)

Also, since (b -k) = 2m and (b +k) = 2n, adding them:

2m + 2n = 2b  
=> m + n = b

Subtracting them:

2n - 2m = 2k  
=> n - m = k

So, from these, we can express b and k in terms of m and n:

b = m + n  
k = n - m

We also have from mn = c(b -1):

c = mn / (b -1)  
But since b = m + n,  
c = mn / (m + n -1)

So, c must be an integer, so (m + n -1) must divide mn.

So, the conditions are:

1. m and n are positive integers with n > m.
2. b = m + n
3. c = mn / (m + n -1) must be integer, and 1 ≤ c ≤ b -1.

Additionally, since (b -k) = 2m and (b +k) = 2n, and since b = m + n, k = n - m, we can see that m and n must be such that their product is a multiple of (m + n - 1), so that c is integer.

So, for each pair (m, n) with n > m, we can compute b = m + n, c = mn / (m + n -1). Then, check if c is integer, and 1 ≤ c ≤ b -1.

Once we have c, we can compute k = n - m, and then from the quadratic equation, we can compute a:

From earlier, the quadratic equation in a is:

a² + (2c - b) a + (c² - c) = 0

We can write the solutions as:

a = [ -(2c - b) ± sqrt(D) ] / 2  
Where D = b² -4c(b -1) = (2m)(2n) =4mn, which is 4mn =4c(b -1). Wait, earlier we had D = k², so yes, it's a perfect square.

But with the substitutions, perhaps we can express a in terms of m and n.

Wait, from the quadratic formula, a is:

a = [b -2c ± sqrt(D)] / 2  
But D = (2m)^2 (since D =4mn, but wait, no, D was equal to k², which is (n - m)^2.

Wait, let me re-express D:

D = (2c - b)^2 -4*(c² - c)  
= b² -4bc +4c  
But from our substitution, we have D = (2m)^2*(2n)^2? No, wait, earlier I set (b -k)=2m and (b +k)=2n, so their product is 4mn, which equals 4c(b -1). So, 4mn =4c(b -1), so mn =c(b -1). So, D is equal to (b -k)(b +k) = 4mn, which is equal to 4c(b -1). So, D =4c(b -1), which is equal to (2m)(2n).

Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused here. Let me think again.

We have:

From the quadratic equation, the discriminant D is (2c - b)^2 -4*(c² -c)  
=4c² -4bc +b² -4c² +4c  
= b² -4bc +4c  
= (b -k)^2

Wait, earlier we set D = k², but wait, no, D is the discriminant, which we set to be a perfect square, say k². So, D = k².

Wait, but from substitution, D = (b -k)(b +k) =4c(b -1). So, D =4c(b -1). So, if I write D as k², then:

k² =4c(b -1)

But in our substitution above, we have:

c = mn / (m +n -1)  
And 4c(b -1) =4c(m +n -1) =4*(mn)/(m +n -1)*(m +n -1) =4mn

So, 4c(b -1) =4mn, which is equal to (2m)(2n), which is consistent with D = (2m)(2n) =4mn.

But wait, this would mean that k² =4mn. So, k must be equal to 2*sqrt(mn). But since k must be integer, sqrt(mn) must be integer, so mn must be a perfect square.

So, mn must be a perfect square. Therefore, m and n must be such that their product is a perfect square. Which implies that m and n are squares multiplied by the same square-free part. So, m = d * x², n = d * y², where d is square-free, and x and y are positive integers.

This is because for mn to be a perfect square, all prime factors in the combined exponents must be even. So, the square-free parts of m and n must be the same, and the exponents of the primes in m and n must complement each other to make even exponents when multiplied.

So, m = d x², n = d y², where d is square-free, and x and y are positive integers.

Then, mn = d² x² y² = (d x y)^2, which is a perfect square, as required.

So, with this substitution, we have:

m = d x²  
n = d y²  
b = m + n = d x² + d y² = d(x² + y²)  
c = mn / (m +n -1) = (d x² * d y²) / (d(x² + y²) -1) = (d² x² y²) / (d(x² + y²) -1)

Since c must be an integer, the denominator must divide the numerator.

So,

d(x² + y²) -1 must divide d² x² y².

Let me write this as:

Denominator: d(x² + y²) -1  
Numerator: d² x² y²

So,

[d(x² + y²) -1] | [d² x² y²]

Which implies that [d(x² + y²) -1] divides d² x² y².

This seems like a restrictive condition. Perhaps we can find small values of d, x, y that satisfy this.

Since d is square-free, the smallest possible values are d=1,2,3, etc.

Let me try d=1.

Then,

Denominator becomes: (x² + y²) -1  
Numerator: x² y²

So, (x² + y² -1) must divide x² y².

So, for d=1, let's try small x and y.

Let me try x=1, y=1:

Denominator:1+1-1=1  
Numerator:1*1=1  
So, 1 divides 1. So, c=1/1=1.  
Then, b=1*(1+1)=2.  
Check if c=1 is ≤ b-1=1. Yes.

So, this gives us a solution for b=2, c=1.

Wait, but let's check if this is valid.

From earlier, c=1, b=2.

So, the quadratic equation in a is:

a² + (2*1 -2)a + (1² -1) = a² + 0a +0 = a² =0  
Which implies a=0, but a must be >=1, so this is invalid. So, this is not a valid solution.

Hmm, so perhaps d=1, x=1, y=1 doesn't give a valid a.

Let me try x=1, y=2.

Denominator:1 +4 -1=4  
Numerator:1*4=4  
So, c=4/4=1.

Then, b=1*(1 +4)=5.

Check if c=1 ≤5-1=4. Yes.

Now, compute a from the quadratic equation:

a² + (2c -b)a + (c² -c) =0  
a² + (2*1 -5)a + (1 -1)=0  
a² -3a =0  
a(a-3)=0  
So, a=0 or a=3.

a=0 is invalid, so a=3. Which is less than b=5. So, valid solution.

So, n =a*b +c=3*5 +1=16  
sqrt(n)=4, and a +c=3+1=4. So, yes, 16 is 5-eautiful.

So, that's a valid solution.

Another case with d=1, x=1, y=3.

Denominator:1+9-1=9  
Numerator:1*9=9  
c=9/9=1  
b=1*(1+9)=10.

Check a:

a² + (2*1 -10)a + (1 -1)=a² -8a=0  
a(a-8)=0  
a=0 invalid, a=8. Which is less than b=10. So, valid.

n=8*10 +1=81  
sqrt(81)=9, a +c=8+1=9. Correct.

So, another valid solution.

Now, let's try x=2, y=2, d=1.

Denominator:4+4-1=7  
Numerator:4*4=16  
c=16/7, which is not integer. So, invalid.

x=1, y=3, d=1 gives c=1 as before.

x=2, y=3, d=1:

Denominator:4+9-1=12  
Numerator:4*9=36  
c=36/12=3  
Then, b=1*(4+9)=13.

Check a:

a² + (2*3 -13)a + (9 -3)=a² + (-7)a +6=0  
Solutions: [7 ± sqrt(49 -24)]/2 = [7 ±5]/2  
So, a=(12)/2=6 or a=(2)/2=1.

So, a=6 and a=1.

Check if they are valid (1 ≤a <13). Both are valid.

So, for a=6: n=6*13 +3=81, which we've seen before.

For a=1: n=1*13 +3=16, which we've also seen.

So, two solutions for b=13 from this case.

So, this suggests that for each valid (d, x, y), we can get certain values of b, and each such b could have multiple solutions.

But this seems complicated. Maybe I can find a pattern or a way to count the number of solutions for each b.

Alternatively, perhaps I can consider that for each b, the number of solutions is equal to the number of ways to write b as m + n, where m and n are positive integers with m < n, and mn is divisible by (m +n -1).

Wait, because from earlier, c = mn/(m +n -1), which must be integer.

So, for each b, the number of pairs (m, n) with m < n, m +n = b, and mn divisible by (b -1), then the number of such pairs would give the number of solutions.

But this seems a bit abstract. Maybe it's better to think about how many such pairs (m, n) exist for each b.

Wait, but since b = m +n, m can range from 1 to (b-1)/2, and n = b -m.

So, for each m from 1 to (b-1)/2, compute whether mn is divisible by (b -1). If yes, then c = mn/(b -1) is an integer, and we have a valid solution.

So, for each b, the number of solutions is equal to the number of m in [1, (b-1)/2] such that mn = m*(b -m) is divisible by (b -1).

Wait, but this might not be the case because earlier I had c = mn/(b -1), but from substitution, we had c = mn/(b -1).

Wait, no, earlier, when I set b = m +n, and c = mn/(b -1), yes.

So, for each m from 1 to floor((b-1)/2), check if (m*(b -m)) is divisible by (b -1). If yes, then c is integer, and thus a solution exists.

So, the number of solutions for each b is equal to the number of divisors m of (b -1) such that m <= (b-1)/2, and (b -m) is also a divisor or such that m*(b -m) is a multiple of (b -1).

Wait, but (b -m) = n, so m and n are factors of (b -1) times something. Hmm.

Alternatively, since m and n = b -m, and mn must be divisible by (b -1), perhaps (b -1) divides m*(b -m).

So, (b -1) | m*(b -m)

Which can be written as:

m*(b -m) ≡0 mod (b -1)

Compute m*(b -m) mod (b -1):

Since b ≡1 mod (b -1), so b -m ≡1 -m mod (b -1).

Thus,

m*(b -m) ≡ m*(1 -m) mod (b -1)

So, m*(1 -m) ≡0 mod (b -1)

Which implies that:

m - m² ≡0 mod (b -1)  
m(1 - m) ≡0 mod (b -1)

So, either m ≡0 mod (b -1) or m ≡1 mod (b -1).

But since m < b, m can't be equal to b -1 unless m =b -1, but then n =1, which is allowed only if m <= (b-1)/2, which for b>2, m=b-1 would be larger than (b-1)/2. So, the only possibility is m ≡0 or 1 mod (b -1).

But since m <b, m can be 0 or 1. But m=0 is invalid because m >=1.

So, m=1.

So, the only possible m that satisfies m*(b -m) divisible by (b -1) is m=1.

Wait, that can't be right because earlier, for b=5, m=1 and n=4, which worked, and for b=13, m=2 and n=11, which also worked.

Wait, perhaps my approach is flawed.

Wait, in the case of b=5:

b-1=4  
m=1, n=4  
m*n=4  
4 is divisible by 4, so c=4/4=1.

In the case of b=13:

b-1=12  
m=2, n=11  
m*n=22  
22 is divisible by 12? No, 22/12=11/6, which is not integer. Wait, but earlier I thought that for m=2, n=11, c=3. Did I make a mistake?

Wait, let me check again. For b=13, m=2, n=11:

c = mn/(b -1)=2*11/(13-1)=22/12=11/6, which is not integer. But earlier, when I used m=2, n=3, I think I messed up the substitution.

Wait, no, earlier when I set x=2, y=3, d=1, I had m= d x²=1*4=4, n= d y²=1*9=9, so m=4, n=9, so b=4+9=13. Then c= mn/(b-1)=4*9/(13-1)=36/12=3, which is integer.

So, in that case, m=4, n=9, which are both squares multiplied by d=1.

So, perhaps m and n are squares, but not necessarily m=1.

So, my earlier approach of m=1 is too restrictive.

So, perhaps the condition is that m and n are such that their product is a multiple of (b -1), which is m +n -1.

Wait, that's a bit circular because b =m +n.

So, perhaps it's better to proceed numerically. Let's try to find for each b, the number of solutions.

Let me try to find for each b starting from 2 upwards, the number of pairs (a, c) that satisfy the conditions.

Alternatively, perhaps I can find a formula for the number of solutions.

But given the time constraints, perhaps it's better to consider that for each b, the number of solutions is equal to the number of divisors of (b -1) that are less than or equal to sqrt(b -1). Because when m is a divisor of (b -1), then n = (b -1)/m, and m <=n.

Wait, but earlier, m and n are such that m +n =b, which complicates things.

Alternatively, perhaps I can think of m as a divisor of (b -1), but I'm not sure.

Wait, let's take an example.

For b=5:

b-1=4, which has divisors 1,2,4.

For each m in [1,2], since (b-1)/2 =2.

Check m=1: m=1, n=4 (since b=5, n=5-1=4). Then, m*n=4, which is divisible by 4, so c=1. Valid.

m=2: n=3, m*n=6. 6 is not divisible by 4, so invalid.

So, only one solution for b=5.

For b=10:

b-1=9, divisors 1,3,9.

Check m=1: n=9, m*n=9. 9 divisible by9? Yes, c=1. Valid.

m=3: n=7, m*n=21. 21 divisible by9? 21/9=7/3, no. Invalid.

m=4: Wait, m can only go up to (b-1)/2=4.5, so m=4 is allowed.

Wait, but m=4, n=6, m*n=24. 24 divisible by9? 24/9=8/3, no.

So, only one solution for b=10.

Wait, but earlier when b=13, we had two solutions: m=4, n=9, and m=2, n=11. Wait, no, earlier substitution was m=4, n=9, which gave c=3, which was valid.

Wait, let's see for b=13:

b-1=12, which has divisors 1,2,3,4,6,12.

For m from 1 to 6:

m=1: n=12, m*n=12. 12 divisible by12? Yes, c=1.

m=2: n=11, m*n=22. 22 divisible by12? 22/12=11/6, no.

m=3: n=10, m*n=30. 30/12=5/2, no.

m=4: n=9, m*n=36. 36/12=3, yes.

m=5: n=8, m*n=40. 40/12=10/3, no.

m=6: n=7, m*n=42. 42/12=7/2, no.

So, two solutions: m=1 and m=4.

Thus, for b=13, there are two solutions.

Wait, but earlier when I used m=4, n=9, which gave c=3, which worked, and m=1, n=12, which gave c=1, which worked. So, that's two solutions.

Another example: b=6.

b-1=5, which has divisors 1,5.

m can be 1,2.

m=1: n=5, m*n=5. 5 divisible by5? Yes, c=1.

m=2: n=4, m*n=8. 8 divisible by5? No.

So, only one solution.

b=7:

b-1=6, divisors 1,2,3,6.

m=1: n=6, m*n=6. 6/6=1, c=1.

m=2: n=5, m*n=10. 10/6=5/3, no.

m=3: n=4, m*n=12. 12/6=2, yes.

m=4: n=3, m*n=12. 12/6=2, yes. But since m=4 >n=3, and we're considering m up to (b-1)/2=3, m=4 is beyond that. So, only m=1 and m=3.

Wait, but m=3 is allowed because (b-1)/2=3, so m=3 is included.

So, for b=7, two solutions: m=1 (c=1) and m=3 (c=2).

Thus, for b=7, two solutions.

Similarly, for b=8:

b-1=7, divisors 1,7.

m can be 1,2,3.

m=1: n=7, m*n=7. 7/7=1, c=1.

m=2: n=6, m*n=12. 12/7 not integer.

m=3: n=5, m*n=15. 15/7 not integer.

So, only one solution.

b=9:

b-1=8, divisors 1,2,4,8.

m up to 4.

m=1: n=8, m*n=8. 8/8=1, c=1.

m=2: n=7, m*n=14. 14/8=7/4, no.

m=3: n=6, m*n=18. 18/8=9/4, no.

m=4: n=5, m*n=20. 20/8=5/2, no.

So, only one solution.

b=10:

As before, one solution.

b=11:

b-1=10, divisors 1,2,5,10.

m up to 5.

m=1: n=10, m*n=10. 10/10=1, c=1.

m=2: n=9, m*n=18. 18/10=9/5, no.

m=3: n=8, m*n=24. 24/10=12/5, no.

m=4: n=7, m*n=28. 28/10=14/5, no.

m=5: n=6, m*n=30. 30/10=3, yes.

So, two solutions for b=11: m=1 and m=5.

So, for b=11, two solutions.

Continuing this way, let's see:

b=12:

b-1=11, divisors 1,11.

m up to 5.

m=1: n=11, m*n=11. 11/11=1, c=1.

m=2: n=10, m*n=20. 20/11 no.

m=3: n=9, m*n=27. 27/11 no.

m=4: n=8, m*n=32. 32/11 no.

m=5: n=7, m*n=35. 35/11 no.

Only one solution.

b=14:

b-1=13, divisors 1,13.

m up to 7.

m=1: n=13, m*n=13. 13/13=1, c=1.

m=2: n=12, m*n=24. 24/13 no.

m=3: n=11, m*n=33. 33/13 no.

m=4: n=10, m*n=40. 40/13 no.

m=5: n=9, m*n=45. 45/13 no.

m=6: n=8, m*n=48. 48/13 no.

m=7: n=7, m*n=49. 49/13 no.

Only one solution.

b=15:

b-1=14, divisors 1,2,7,14.

m up to7.

m=1: n=14, m*n=14. 14/14=1, c=1.

m=2: n=13, m*n=26. 26/14=13/7, no.

m=3: n=12, m*n=36. 36/14=18/7, no.

m=4: n=11, m*n=44. 44/14=22/7, no.

m=5: n=10, m*n=50. 50/14=25/7, no.

m=6: n=9, m*n=54. 54/14=27/7, no.

m=7: n=8, m*n=56. 56/14=4, yes.

So, two solutions: m=1 and m=7.

So, for b=15, two solutions.

Hmm, from the examples, it seems that the number of solutions per b depends on the number of divisors of (b-1) that are <= (b-1)/2, such that m*(b -m) is divisible by (b -1).

But this is getting complicated. Perhaps a better approach is to note that each solution corresponds to a pair (m, n) where m and n are positive integers, m <n, m +n =b, and mn is divisible by (b -1).

So, for each b, the number of solutions is equal to the number of such pairs (m, n). So, to find the minimal b where this count exceeds 10, we need to find the smallest b where the number of such pairs is greater than 10.

But manually checking each b is time-consuming. Alternatively, perhaps we can find a formula or pattern.

Wait, considering that for each divisor d of (b -1), if d <= (b -1)/2, then m=d and n=(b -1)/d (if d divides (b -1)).

Wait, but this may not always hold because m +n must equal b.

Wait, perhaps I need to approach this differently.

Let me consider that for each divisor d of (b -1), if d <= (b -1)/2, then m=d and n=(b -1)/d. But m +n must equal b.

So,

d + (b -1)/d =b  
Multiply both sides by d:

d² + (b -1) =b d  
=> d² -b d + (b -1)=0

Which is a quadratic in d:

d² -b d + (b -1)=0

The discriminant D for this quadratic is:

D = b² -4*(b -1)  
= b² -4b +4  
= (b -2)^2

Which is a perfect square. So, the solutions are:

d = [b ± (b -2)] / 2

So,

d = [b + (b -2)] /2 = (2b -2)/2 =b -1  
d = [b - (b -2)] /2 =2/2=1

So, the only divisors d of (b -1) that satisfy d + (b -1)/d =b are d=1 and d=(b -1).

But d=1: then m=1, n=(b -1). So, m +n =1 + (b -1)=b.

Similarly, d=(b -1): m=(b -1), n=1, but m >n, so we only consider m=1.

So, this suggests that the only solution where m and n are such that m +n =b and mn is divisible by (b -1) is when m=1 and n=b -1.

But earlier examples show that there are other solutions, such as b=13, m=4, n=9.

So, perhaps this approach is missing something.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in assuming that m and n must be such that m*(b -m) is divisible by (b -1). Alternatively, perhaps the condition is that (b -1) divides m*(b -m).

So, for each m from 1 to (b-1)/2, check if (b -1) divides m*(b -m).

Which is equivalent to:

m*(b -m) ≡0 mod (b -1)

But as we saw earlier, m*(b -m) ≡m*(1 -m) mod (b -1).

So,

m*(1 -m) ≡0 mod (b -1)

Which implies that either m ≡0 mod (b -1) or m ≡1 mod (b -1).

But since m <b, m can only be 0 or 1. But m=0 is invalid, so m=1.

Thus, the only solution is m=1, which implies that for each b, there's only one solution when m=1.

But this contradicts earlier examples where b=13 had two solutions.

So, perhaps my approach is flawed, and the condition is more complex.

Alternatively, perhaps the mistake lies in the substitution step where I set (b -k)=2m and (b +k)=2n. Maybe that substitution isn't capturing all possible solutions.

Alternatively, perhaps I should try a different approach.

Let me go back to the original equation:

n = a*b +c  
sqrt(n) =a +c  
So, (a +c)^2 =a*b +c  
Which can be rewritten as:

a² + 2ac +c² =a b +c  
Rearranged:

a² + (2c - b)a + (c² -c) =0

This is a quadratic in a, so the solutions are:

a = [b -2c ± sqrt(D)]/2  
Where D = (2c -b)^2 -4*(c² -c)  
=4c² -4b c +b² -4c² +4c  
= b² -4b c +4c  
= b² -4c(b -1)

For a to be integer, D must be a perfect square, say k².

So,

b² -4c(b -1) =k²  
So,

b² -k² =4c(b -1)  
Which can be written as:

(b -k)(b +k)=4c(b -1)

Since 4c(b -1) is the product of (b -k) and (b +k), and both are positive integers with b >k.

So, for each c from1 to b-1, we can compute if (b -k)(b +k)=4c(b -1) has integer solutions for k.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to consider that for each c, we can express b in terms of k and c.

But this might not lead us anywhere.

Alternatively, perhaps I can consider that for a given b, the number of solutions is equal to the number of c's such that b² -4c(b -1) is a perfect square.

So, for each b, I can count the number of c's in [1, b-1] for which D is a perfect square.

This seems computationally intensive, but perhaps I can find a pattern or a formula.

Alternatively, perhaps I can think of c in terms of b and k.

From D =k² =b² -4c(b -1), we can solve for c:

c = (b² -k²)/(4(b -1))

So, c must be integer, so (b² -k²) must be divisible by 4(b -1).

Which can be written as:

c = (b -k)(b +k)/(4(b -1))

So, for c to be integer, 4(b -1) must divide (b -k)(b +k).

Since (b -k) and (b +k) are factors, and their product is 4c(b -1), perhaps we can set (b -k) =d and (b +k)=e, where d and e are positive integers with e >d, and d*e=4c(b -1).

But this approach seems to be going in circles.

Perhaps, given the time constraints, it's better to note that the number of solutions for each b is equal to the number of ways to write 4c(b -1) as a product of two factors (d, e) such that d <e and d +e=2b.

Wait, because d =b -k and e =b +k, so d +e=2b.

So, for each b, the number of solutions is equal to the number of ways to write 4c(b -1) as d *e, where d <e and d +e=2b.

But 4c(b -1) =d *e, and d +e=2b.

So, solving these two equations:

d +e=2b  
d*e=4c(b -1)

We can express e=2b -d, so substituting into the second equation:

d*(2b -d)=4c(b -1)  
=> 2b d -d²=4c(b -1)

Rearranged:

d² -2b d +4c(b -1)=0

This is a quadratic in d:

d² -2b d +4c(b -1)=0

The discriminant D must be a perfect square:

D = (2b)^2 -4*1*4c(b -1)  
=4b² -16c(b -1)  
=4[b² -4c(b -1)]

Which must be a perfect square.

But since D=4[b² -4c(b -1)] and we already have D=k² from earlier, this seems consistent.

But this approach doesn't seem to provide a new insight.

Perhaps it's better to proceed by trying to find for each b, the number of c's such that c=(b² -k²)/(4(b -1)) is integer and 1 ≤c ≤b-1.

So, for each b starting from 2, compute c for various k's and count the valid c's.

Let me try for b=2:

c=(4 -k²)/(4*(1))  
We need c to be integer and 1 ≤c ≤1.

So, possible k's: k must be less than b=2, so k=1.

k=1: c=(4 -1)/4=3/4, not integer.

No solutions.

b=3:

c=(9 -k²)/(4*2)= (9 -k²)/8

Possible k=1,2.

k=1: (9-1)/8=1, which is integer and c=1≤2.

So, c=1.

Thus, one solution.

k=2: (9-4)/8=5/8, not integer.

So, one solution.

b=4:

c=(16 -k²)/(4*3)= (16 -k²)/12

k=1: (16-1)/12=15/12=5/4, no.

k=2: (16-4)/12=12/12=1, yes.

k=3: (16-9)/12=7/12, no.

So, one solution.

b=5:

c=(25 -k²)/(4*4)= (25 -k²)/16

k=1:24/16=3/2, no.

k=2:21/16, no.

k=3:16/16=1, yes.

k=4:25-16=9/16, no.

So, one solution.

Wait, but earlier for b=5, I found that c=1 was a solution, which gives a=3, so that's valid.

Similarly, for b=6:

c=(36 -k²)/(4*5)= (36 -k²)/20

k=1:35/20=7/4, no.

k=2:32/20=8/5, no.

k=3:27/20, no.

k=4:20/20=1, yes.

k=5:11/20, no.

So, one solution.

b=7:

c=(49 -k²)/(4*6)= (49 -k²)/24

k=1:48/24=2, yes.

k=2:45/24=15/8, no.

k=3:40/24=5/3, no.

k=4:33/24=11/8, no.

k=5:24/24=1, yes.

k=6:13/24, no.

So, two solutions: c=2 and c=1.

Thus, for b=7, two solutions.

Similarly, for b=8:

c=(64 -k²)/(4*7)= (64 -k²)/28

k=1:63/28=9/4, no.

k=2:60/28=15/7, no.

k=3:55/28, no.

k=4:48/28=12/7, no.

k=5:39/28, no.

k=6:28/28=1, yes.

k=7:64-49=15/28, no.

So, one solution.

b=9:

c=(81 -k²)/(4*8)= (81 -k²)/32

k=1:80/32=2.5, no.

k=2:77/32, no.

k=3:72/32=9/4, no.

k=4:65/32, no.

k=5:56/32=7/4, no.

k=6:45/32, no.

k=7:32/32=1, yes.

k=8:81-64=17/32, no.

So, one solution.

b=10:

c=(100 -k²)/(4*9)= (100 -k²)/36

k=1:99/36=11/4, no.

k=2:96/36=8/3, no.

k=3:91/36, no.

k=4:84/36=7/3, no.

k=5:75/36=25/12, no.

k=6:64/36=16/9, no.

k=7:51/36=17/12, no.

k=8:32/36=8/9, no.

k=9:100-81=19/36, no.

So, no solutions? Wait, but earlier for b=10, I found c=1 as a solution. Hmm.

Wait, when k= sqrt(b² -4c(b-1)).

Wait, perhaps I should check c=1:

c=1, so:

D =100 -4*1*9=100-36=64=8².

So, k=8.

So, a = [10 -2*1 ±8]/2 = (10-2±8)/2.

So, a=(10-2+8)/2=16/2=8, and a=(10-2-8)/2=0/2=0 (invalid).

So, a=8, which is less than 10, valid.

Thus, for b=10, c=1 is a solution, so one solution.

But according to the formula, when k=8, c=(100 -64)/(4*9)=36/36=1, yes.

So, why didn't the earlier approach for b=10 find two solutions? Because when k=8, c=1, but when k=sqrt(b² -4c(b-1)), perhaps there are other k's that result in integer c's.

Wait, perhaps for b=10, there's only one solution.

Wait, earlier when I thought b=10 had one solution, that's correct.

So, proceeding:

b=11:

c=(121 -k²)/(4*10)= (121 -k²)/40

k=1:120/40=3, yes.

k=2:117/40, no.

k=3:112/40=2.8, no.

k=4:105/40=21/8, no.

k=5:96/40=2.4, no.

k=6:85/40=17/8, no.

k=7:64/40=1.6, no.

k=8:41/40, no.

k=9:121-81=40/40=1, yes.

k=10:121-100=21/40, no.

So, two solutions: c=3 and c=1.

Thus, for b=11, two solutions.

b=12:

c=(144 -k²)/(4*11)= (144 -k²)/44

k=1:143/44≈3.25, no.

k=2:140/44=35/11≈3.18, no.

k=3:135/44≈3.07, no.

k=4:128/44=32/11≈2.91, no.

k=5:119/44≈2.7, no.

k=6:108/44=27/11≈2.45, no.

k=7:95/44≈2.16, no.

k=8:80/44=20/11≈1.81, no.

k=9:75/44≈1.70, no.

k=10:64/44=16/11≈1.45, no.

k=11:144-121=23/44≈0.52, no.

So, no solutions? Wait, but let's check c=1:

c=1:

D=144 -4*1*11=144-44=100=10².

So, k=10.

a = [12 -2*1 ±10]/2 = (12-2±10)/2.

So, a=(12-2+10)/2=20/2=10, which is less than 12.

a=(12-2-10)/2=0, invalid.

So, a=10, valid. So, c=1 is a solution.

But according to the formula, when k=10, c=1, which we've found. But the formula didn't show any other solutions. So, perhaps for b=12, there's only one solution.

Wait, maybe I missed k= sqrt(144 -4c*11).

Wait, perhaps there's another c that works. Let's try c=2:

c=2:

D=144 -4*2*11=144-88=56, which is not a perfect square.

c=3:

D=144-4*3*11=144-132=12, not a square.

c=4:

D=144-4*4*11=144-176= -32, invalid.

So, only c=1 works.

Thus, for b=12, one solution.

b=13:

c=(169 -k²)/(4*12)= (169 -k²)/48

k=1:168/48=3.5, no.

k=2:165/48≈3.4375, no.

k=3:160/48≈3.333, no.

k=4:153/48≈3.1875, no.

k=5:144/48=3, yes.

k=6:133/48≈2.77, no.

k=7:120/48=2.5, no.

k=8:105/48≈2.1875, no.

k=9:88/48≈1.833, no.

k=10:69/48≈1.4375, no.

k=11:48/48=1, yes.

k=12:169-144=25/48≈0.52, no.

So, two solutions: c=3 and c=1.

Thus, for b=13, two solutions.

b=14:

c=(196 -k²)/(4*13)= (196 -k²)/52

k=1:195/52≈3.75, no.

k=2:192/52≈3.69, no.

k=3:187/52≈3.596, no.

k=4:180/52≈3.4615, no.

k=5:171/52≈3.288, no.

k=6:152/52=38/13≈2.923, no.

k=7:129/52≈2.480, no.

k=8:92/52=23/13≈1.769, no.

k=9:55/52≈1.057, no.

k=10:196-100=96/52=24/13≈1.846, no.

k=11:196-121=75/52≈1.442, no.

k=12:196-144=52/52=1, yes.

k=13:196-169=27/52≈0.519, no.

So, one solution: c=1.

b=15:

c=(225 -k²)/(4*14)= (225 -k²)/56

k=1:224/56=4, yes.

k=2:221/56≈3.946, no.

k=12:75/56≈1.339, no.

k=13:40/56=5/7≈0.714, no.

k=14:225-196=29/56≈0.517, no.

So, one solution: c=4.

Wait, but earlier I thought b=15 had two solutions, but according to this, only c=4 is valid.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let me check again.

When k= sqrt(225 -4c*14).

For c=1:

D=225 -4*1*14=225-56=169=13².

So, k=13.

a = [15 -2*1 ±13]/2.

So, a=(15-2+13)/2=26/2=13, which is less than 15.

a=(15-2-13)/2=0, invalid.

So, a=13, which is valid.

For c=4:

D=225 -4*4*14=225-224=1=1².

So, k=1.

a = [15 -8 ±1]/2.

So, a=(15-8+1)/2=8/2=4, valid.

a=(15-8-1)/2=6/2=3, valid.

Thus, two solutions: a=13 and a=3.

So, for b=15, two solutions.

Wait, but according to the formula, when k=13, c=1, and when k=1, c=4.

So, two solutions.

Thus, for b=15, two solutions.

Continuing this way, it's clear that for each b, the number of solutions varies, but it's not exceeding two for small b's.

But the problem asks for the minimal b where the number of solutions exceeds ten. So, perhaps the minimal b is much larger.

Alternatively, perhaps there's a pattern where for certain b's, the number of solutions increases.

Wait, perhaps if we consider that for each divisor d of (b -1), there's a corresponding solution.

So, the number of solutions is equal to the number of divisors of (b -1) that are <= (b -1)/2.

But in that case, the number of solutions would be equal to the number of such divisors, which for highly composite numbers could be large.

For example, if (b -1) is a highly composite number, it would have many divisors, leading to many solutions.

So, perhaps the minimal b is such that (b -1) has more than 20 divisors, leading to more than ten solutions.

Wait, but the number of solutions is equal to the number of valid c's, which in turn depends on the number of valid m's, which depends on the number of divisors.

Alternatively, perhaps the number of solutions for a given b is equal to the number of ways to write (b -1) as a product of two integers, which is half the number of divisors of (b -1).

But this is getting too vague.

Alternatively, perhaps the number of solutions for b is equal to the number of divisors of (b -1) that are less than or equal to sqrt(b -1).

But I'm not sure.

Given the time constraints, perhaps I can look for a b where (b -1) has many factors, leading to many solutions.

Looking for b where (b -1) is highly composite.

For example:

- b=101: b-1=100, which has many divisors.

But let's check:

b=101, b-1=100, which has divisors 1,2,4,5,10,20,25,50,100.

So, number of valid m's would be the number of divisors d of 100 where d <=50 (since m <= (b-1)/2=50).

Each such d gives a solution.

So, the number of solutions would be the number of such d's, which is 9.

But 9 is less than 10.

Next, b=105: b-1=104.

104 has divisors 1,2,4,8,13,26,52,104.

So, number of solutions would be the number of d's <=52, which are 1,2,4,8,13,26,52: 7 solutions.

Still less than 10.

b=121: b-1=120.

120 has many divisors: 1,2,3,4,5,6,8,10,12,15,20,24,30,40,60,120.

Number of solutions would be the number of d's <=60: 15 divisors, so 15 solutions.

Thus, for b=121, there are 15 solutions, which is more than ten.

But perhaps there's a smaller b.

Check b=61: b-1=60.

60 has divisors 1,2,3,4,5,6,10,12,15,20,30,60.

Number of solutions: number of d's <=30: 12 divisors, which would give 12 solutions.

Thus, for b=61, 12 solutions, which is more than ten.

But is there a smaller b?

Check b=31: b-1=30.

30 has divisors 1,2,3,5,6,10,15,30.

Number of solutions: number of d's <=15: 8 divisors, giving 8 solutions.

Less than ten.

b=49: b-1=48.

48 has divisors 1,2,3,4,6,8,12,16,24,48.

Number of solutions: d's <=24: 9 divisors, so 9 solutions.

Still less than ten.

b=85: b-1=84.

84 has divisors 1,2,3,4,6,7,12,14,21,28,42,84.

Number of solutions: d's <=42: 11 divisors, so 11 solutions.

Which is more than ten.

So, b=85 would have 11 solutions.

But perhaps there's a smaller b.

Check b=61 as above: 12 solutions.

Check b=57: b-1=56.

56 has divisors 1,2,4,7,8,14,28,56.

Number of solutions: d's <=28: 7 divisors, 7 solutions.

b=77: b-1=76.

76 has divisors 1,2,4,19,38,76.

Number of solutions: d's <=38: 5 divisors, 5 solutions.

b=93: b-1=92.

92 has divisors 1,2,4,23,46,92.

Number of solutions: d's <=46: 5 divisors, 5 solutions.

b=105: as above, 7 solutions.

Wait, perhaps b=121 is the minimal where the number of solutions exceeds ten.

But earlier, for b=121, (b-1)=120 has 16 divisors, so the number of solutions would be 16/2=8? Or perhaps the number of valid m's is equal to the number of divisors d <= (b-1)/2, which for 120 is 60.

The number of divisors of 120 less than or equal to 60 is:

1,2,3,4,5,6,8,10,12,15,20,24,30,40,60.

That's 15 divisors.

So, for each such d, we have a solution.

Thus, for b=121, 15 solutions.

But perhaps there's a smaller b where (b-1) has more than 20 divisors, but let's check intermediate values.

Wait, b=101: b-1=100, which has 9 divisors <=50, leading to 9 solutions.

b=105: b-1=104, which has 7 solutions.

b=121:15 solutions.

Is there a smaller b where (b-1) has more than 10 solutions?

Wait, let's think differently. The number of solutions is the number of c's where c=(b² -k²)/(4(b-1)) is integer.

If (b -1) is highly composite, then it would have many divisors, leading to many solutions.

Looking for (b -1) with many small factors.

For example, let's check b=25: b-1=24, which has 8 divisors.

Number of solutions would be 8, which is less than ten.

b=37: b-1=36, which has 9 divisors.

Number of solutions:9, which is less than ten.

b=49: as above, 9 solutions.

b=61:12 solutions.

b=73: b-1=72, which has 12 divisors.

Number of solutions:12, which is more than ten.

So, for b=73, we have 12 solutions.

Wait, but earlier I thought b=73 would have 12 solutions because (b-1)=72 has 12 divisors.

But wait, the number of solutions is the number of divisors d of (b-1) that are <= (b-1)/2.

For b=73, (b-1)/2=36.

The divisors of 72 up to 36 are:

1,2,3,4,6,8,9,12,18,24,36.

That's 11 divisors.

So, 11 solutions, which is more than ten.

Thus, b=73 would have 11 solutions.

But is there a smaller b?

Check b=61: (b-1)=60.

Divisors of 60 up to 30 are:

1,2,3,4,5,6,10,12,15,20,30.

That's 11 divisors.

So, for b=61, 11 solutions.

Thus, b=61 is smaller than 73 and has 11 solutions.

Is there a smaller b?

Check b=57: b-1=56, which has 8 solutions.

b=61 is the next candidate.

But wait, let's check b=49: (b-1)=48.

Divisors of 48 up to 24 are:

1,2,3,4,6,8,12,16,24.

That's 9 solutions.

So, less than ten.

Thus, the minimal b where the number of solutions exceeds ten is b=61.

Wait, but earlier for b=15, we had two solutions, and for b=61, we have 11 solutions.

Thus, the minimal b is 61.


The minimal base \( b \) for which there are more than ten \( b \)-eautiful integers is \( \boxed{61} \).
