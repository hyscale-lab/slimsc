Okay, so I have this problem here about counting the number of paths on an 8x8 grid. The paths are from the lower left corner to the upper right corner, and they have exactly four direction changes. The paths are of length 16, which makes sense because in an 8x8 grid, moving from one corner to the opposite requires 8 right and 8 up moves, totaling 16 steps.

First, let me make sure I understand the problem correctly. An 8x8 grid has points arranged in 9x9 squares, right? So moving from (0,0) to (8,8) would involve moving 8 steps right and 8 steps up. Each path is a sequence of these steps, and the total number of steps is 16. Now, the key condition here is that the path changes direction exactly four times.

Hmm, direction changes. So, in terms of movement, a path alternates between moving right and up. Each time it switches from right to up or from up to right, that's a direction change. So if a path changes direction exactly four times, how does that affect the structure of the path?

Let me think. Let's say the path starts by moving right. Each time it changes direction, it switches to up, then back to right, and so on. So the number of direction changes is related to the number of times it alternates between right and up.

Wait, but direction changes can occur in the middle of a straight segment, right? So, for example, if I'm moving right several times, then up several times, each of those is a straight segment. The number of direction changes is one less than the number of straight segments, because each direction change starts a new segment.

So if I have four direction changes, that means the path is composed of five straight segments. Because each direction change adds a new segment. So, for example, if I start by moving right, change direction once to up, then another change back to right, and so on, each change adds another segment.

So, with four direction changes, the path has five segments. Now, these segments alternate between right and up. So if the first segment is right, the next is up, then right, up, right, up, right, and then another up. Or if it starts with up, similarly.

But wait, starting direction could be either right or up, but in an 8x8 grid, you have to make 8 right and 8 up moves in total. So the number of right and up segments must each be such that their total steps sum to 8.

Since the path alternates direction each time, the number of right segments and up segments depends on whether the number of segments is odd or even. Let me see: if the path starts with right, then the number of right segments is either three or four, depending on the number of segments. Wait, noâ€”since five segments would alternate R, U, R, U, R. So starting with R, the segments are R, U, R, U, R. So that's three R segments and two U segments. Wait, but that would require 3 R segments and 2 U segments. Each R segment needs to sum to 8 total R moves, and U segments sum to 8 total U moves.

Wait, but 3 R segments would imply that the R
