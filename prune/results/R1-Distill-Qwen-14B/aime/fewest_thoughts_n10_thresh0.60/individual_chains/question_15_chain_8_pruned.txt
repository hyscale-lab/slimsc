Okay, so I have this problem about counting paths on an 8x8 grid. The paths are from the lower left corner to the upper right corner, and they have to be of length 16. I need to find how many such paths change direction exactly four times.

Hmm, let me first make sure I understand the problem correctly. An 8x8 grid means there are 8 rows and 8 columns, so moving from the lower left to the upper right would require moving 8 steps right and 8 steps up, totaling 16 steps. Each path is made up of these steps, right?

Wait, the problem says paths of length 16. But moving from one corner to the opposite on an 8x8 grid would indeed take exactly 16 steps (8 right and 8 up). So each path is a sequence of 8 rights (R) and 8 ups (U), arranged in some order. The total number of such paths without any restrictions is the binomial coefficient C(16,8), which is 12870. But here, we have a restriction: the path must change direction exactly four times.

Oh, right, changing direction. So when do you change direction? In a grid path, each time you switch from moving right to up or from up to right, that's a direction change. So, for example, if you go right a few times, then up a few times, then right again, that's two direction changes.

Wait, let me clarify: each time the direction changes, that counts as one change. So starting direction is right, then when you switch to up, that's one change. When you switch back to right, that's a second change, and so on. So each direction switch adds a change.

So, in a path, the number of direction changes is one less than the number of runs. A run is a consecutive sequence of the same direction. So, for example, if you have RRRUUURRRUUURRUU, that's 3 R runs and 3 U runs, totaling 6 runs, which would mean 5 direction changes. Wait, no: the first direction is R, then U, then R, then U, then R, then U. So that's 5 changes.

Wait, more accurately, the number of direction changes is equal to (number of runs - 1). So if a path has k runs, it has (k-1) direction changes.

Therefore, in the problem, we're supposed to find paths that change direction exactly four times. So that would mean they have 5 runs. Because 4 changes + 1 = 5 runs.

So, each path is a sequence of R and U steps, with exactly 5 runs. Each run is a consecutive sequence of the same direction. So, these runs can be either R or U, but since the path starts at the lower left and ends at the upper right, the first run must be R, and the last run must be U.

Wait, no, actually, that's not necessarily the case. Let me think. Wait, the starting point is lower left, and the ending point is upper right. So, you have to move right and up. So, the first step could be either R or U, but that would determine the initial direction. But since overall, you have to end up with 8 R and 8 U steps, the starting direction isn't fixed. Hmm, but actually, in the grid, movement is only right or up. So, the path starts at (0,0) and ends at (8,8). So, the initial direction can be right or up, but the path must consist of a total of 8 R's and 8 U's.

Wait, but if the path starts with a U, then you're moving up first, but since you have to get to (8,8), you'll have to go back right at some point. But the problem is, changing direction four times, so maybe that's possible.

Wait, but actually, no, the starting direction is determined by the path. So, for instance, a path can start with R or U, and each time it changes direction, it alternates between R and U.

But since the path must have exactly 4 direction changes, that means 5 runs. So, the number of runs is 5, which could be arranged in different ways.

But wait, since the path starts with either R or U, and alternates each time.

So, if the path has 5 runs, the number of runs for R and U can vary. Since the total number of runs is 5, it can be either 3 R runs and 2 U runs, or 2 R runs and 3 U runs.

Wait, because 5 is the total number of runs. So, the first run could be R and then the next U, R, U, R, which is 3 R runs and 2 U runs. Alternatively, starting with U, then R, U, R, U, which would be 2 R runs and 3 U runs.

But wait, in an 8x8 grid, starting at (0,0), ending at (8,8). So, suppose the path starts with R, then alternates. The number of R runs would be either 3 or 2, depending on whether the first run is R or U.

Wait, no, if the first run is R, then the number of R runs would be 3 if there are 5 runs, because the runs would be R, U, R, U, R. That's 3 R runs and 2 U runs. Alternatively, if starting with U, the runs would be U, R, U, R, U, which is 2 R runs and 3 U runs.

But wait, since the total number of steps is 16 (8 R and 8 U), the number of R runs and U runs cannot be arbitrary. The sum of the lengths of R runs must be 8, and similarly for U runs.

Therefore, for each case where the number of R runs is 3 or 2, and the number of U runs is 2 or 3, respectively, we can compute the number of possible paths.

So, let's formalize this.

Case 1: The path starts with R, and has 3 R runs and 2 U runs.

Each R run is a consecutive sequence of R's, and each U run is a consecutive sequence of U's. So, the path would look like R^a U^b R^c U^d R^e, where a + c + e = 8 (total R steps) and b + d = 8 (total U steps). Also, a, c, e >=1, and b, d >=1.

Similarly, Case 2: The path starts with U, and has 3 U runs and 2 R runs. So the structure would be U^a R^b U^c R^d U^e, where a + c + e =8 and b + d=8, with a, c, e >=1 and b, d >=1.

So, in each case, the number of paths is the number of ways to partition the R steps into runs and U steps into runs, multiplied by the number of ways to arrange these runs.

Wait, no. Actually, in each case, the number of paths would be the product of the number of compositions for R steps and U steps.

So, for Case 1: Starting with R, 3 R runs and 2 U runs.

The number of ways to split 8 R's into 3 runs is the number of compositions of 8 into 3 parts, each at least 1. Similarly for U's into 2 runs.

Similarly, for Case 2: Starting with U, 3 U runs and 2 R runs.

So, the number of compositions for U's is C(8-1,3-1) = C(7,2) = 21, and for R's it's C(7,1)=7.

Wait, no. Wait, the number of compositions of n into k parts is C(n-1, k-1). So, for R's: 8 into 3, which is C(7,2)=21, and U's: 8 into 2, which is C(7,1)=7.

Similarly, for Case 2, U's into 3 parts: C(7,2)=21, and R's into 2 parts: C(7,1)=7.

Therefore, for each case, the number of paths is 21 * 7 = 147.

But wait, since there are two cases (starting with R and starting with U), the total number of paths would be 2 * 147 = 294.

Wait, is that correct?

Wait, no. Wait, in Case 1: starting with R, number of ways is (number of compositions for R runs) * (number of compositions for U runs). So that's C(7,2) * C(7,1) = 21 *7=147.

Similarly, Case 2: starting with U, it's C(7,2)*C(7,1)=21*7=147.

So total number of paths is 147 + 147 = 294.

But wait, let me think again. Are these the only possibilities? Because the number of direction changes is 4, so 5 runs.

But could the number of runs be something else? Let me check.

Wait, for 4 direction changes, the number of runs is 5, as direction changes happen between runs. So, the number of runs is 5, which can be either 3 R runs and 2 U runs, or 2 R runs and 3 U runs, as I considered before.

Therefore, the total number of such paths is 2*(C(7,2)*C(7,1)) = 2*(21*7)=294.

But wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the number of compositions.

Wait, when you split 8 R's into 3 runs, each run has at least 1 R, so the number of ways is C(8-1,3-1)=C(7,2)=21. Similarly, 8 U's into 2 runs: C(7,1)=7.

So, the number of ways for each case is 21*7=147, and since there are two cases (starting with R or starting with U), total is 294.

But wait, let me think of another approach to verify.

Alternatively, another way to model this is using stars and bars. For each direction, the number of runs corresponds to the number of partitions.

Alternatively, maybe inclusion-exclusion, but that might complicate.

Alternatively, think of the path as a sequence of steps where each run alternates direction, starting with either R or U. The number of direction changes is 4, so there are 5 runs.

Each run must have at least 1 step. So, for starting with R, we have 3 R runs and 2 U runs. Each R run has at least 1 R, each U run has at least 1 U.

So, the number of ways to split 8 R's into 3 runs is C(7,2)=21, as before. Similarly, U's into 2 runs is C(7,1)=7.

Similarly, starting with U, it's the same.

So, 21*7*2=294.

So, is that the answer? 294.

But wait, let me verify with a smaller grid. Suppose we have a 2x2 grid, and want paths of length 4 with exactly two direction changes. So, number of direction changes is 2, which would mean 3 runs.

So, starting with R, we have 2 R runs and 1 U run.

Wait, no, in 2x2 grid, to go from (0,0) to (2,2), we need 2 R and 2 U steps.

If the number of direction changes is 2, that implies 3 runs.

So, starting with R, runs would be R, U, R. So, two R runs and one U run.

Wait, but in that case, the number of R runs is 2, and U runs is 1.

So, the number of ways would be C(1,1) for R runs (since splitting 2 R's into 2 runs: 1 way is 1 and 1), and C(1,0) for U runs? Wait, no.

Wait, 2 R's into 2 runs: the number of compositions is C(2-1,2-1)=C(1,1)=1.

Similarly, 2 U's into 1 run: C(2-1,1-1)=C(1,0)=1.

So, number of paths starting with R: 1*1=1.

Similarly, starting with U, it's 1*1=1.

Total paths: 2.

But let's list them.

Starting with R:

R U R U

R U R R (no, that would be two U's, which is not allowed since we only have two U's total. Wait, no. Wait, 2 U's. So in the case of starting with R, the runs are R, U, R. So the U run must be length 2, because total U's are 2. Similarly, the R runs are 1 each.

So, the only path is R U U R R? No, wait, in 2x2 grid, you can't have a U run of length 2 because after moving up twice, you can't move right twice without changing direction again.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating.

Wait, in the 2x2 grid, how many paths have exactly two direction changes.

Each such path would start R, then switch to U, then switch back to R, and then switch to U again? Wait, no, that would be three direction changes.

Wait, let me think:

Actually, for a 2x2 grid, the minimal number of direction changes is 2: for example, R R U U has 1 direction change. R U R U has 3 direction changes.

Wait, no, let me check:

Wait, no, R R U U is two runs: R and U. So, one direction change.

R U R U is four runs: R, U, R, U. So, three direction changes.

Wait, so how to get exactly two direction changes.

Wait, maybe U R R U. Wait, that's starting with U, then R, then U. So, runs: U, R, U. So, two direction changes.

Similarly, R U R R is starting with R, then U, then R. So, runs: R, U, R. So, two direction changes.

So, in the 2x2 grid, there are two such paths: one starting with R (R U R R) and one starting with U (U R R U). So, total of 2 paths.

Which matches our earlier calculation of 2*(C(1,1)*C(1,0))=2*1*1=2.

Wait, but according to our formula earlier, for 2x2 grid, n=2, m=2.

Wait, but in the problem, the number of direction changes is exactly 2, so the number of runs is 3.

But in our formula, for 2 direction changes, 3 runs, which would be:

Case 1: starting with R, 2 R runs and 1 U run.

Number of ways: C(1,1) * C(1,0) = 1 *1=1.

Case 2: starting with U, 2 U runs and 1 R run.

Number of ways: C(1,1)*C(1,0)=1*1=1.

Total: 2, which is correct.

So, that seems to check out.

Therefore, returning to the original problem, the number of paths is 2*(C(7,2)*C(7,1))=2*(21*7)=294.

But wait, let me think again: when starting with R, we have 3 R runs and 2 U runs.

Wait, no. Wait, if the number of runs is 5, with 4 direction changes, then starting with R, the number of R runs is 3 and U runs is 2. Because starting with R, the runs alternate R, U, R, U, R. So, 3 R runs and 2 U runs.

Similarly, starting with U, you have 3 U runs and 2 R runs.

So the number of ways is:

For starting with R:

Number of ways to split 8 R's into 3 runs: C(7,2)=21.

Number of ways to split 8 U's into 2 runs: C(7,1)=7.

So, 21*7=147.

For starting with U:

Number of ways to split 8 U's into 3 runs: C(7,2)=21.

Number of ways to split 8 R's into 2 runs: C(7,1)=7.

So, 21*7=147.

Total: 147+147=294.

So, that seems correct.

Wait, but another way to think about it is that the number of such paths is 2 * C(8-1, (number of runs for R)-1) * C(8-1, (number of runs for U)-1).

Wait, but maybe that's complicating.

Alternatively, perhaps another approach is to model the number of direction changes as the number of times the path switches from R to U or U to R.

Each time it switches, that's a direction change.

So, the number of direction changes is 4, which would mean the path alternates direction 4 times.

Wait, but that's equivalent to having 5 runs.

So, each path has 5 runs, with the first run being R or U, and alternating.

So, the number of such paths is 2 times the number of ways to split R's and U's into the runs.

Which is what I did earlier.

Therefore, my conclusion is that the answer is 294.

But wait, wait a second. Let me check for another case, say 3x3 grid, to see if my formula still holds.

In a 3x3 grid, n=3, m=3.

Suppose we want paths that change direction exactly two times, so number of runs is 3.

So, starting with R: 2 R runs and 1 U run.

Number of ways: C(2,1)*C(2,0)=2*1=2.

Starting with U: 2 U runs and 1 R run.

Number of ways: same, 2*1=2.

Total:4.

But let's list all possible paths with exactly 2 direction changes.

Each such path must have 3 runs.

Starting with R:

Possible splits: R, U, R.

So, the R runs must sum to 3, and U run to 3.

Possible ways:

R:1, U:3, R:2. So the sequence is R U U U R R.

Wait, but that's only 1 R run, no. Wait, no, the runs are R, U, R.

So R is split into two runs: a and b, with a + b =3.

Similarly, U is split into one run: c, where c=3.

So, a and b can be 1+2, 2+1.

So, two possibilities.

Similarly, starting with U, same thing.

So, total of 4 paths.

Which matches the calculation.

So, in this case, our formula works.

Therefore, returning to the original problem, I think the answer is 294.

But wait, another way to think about it is using generating functions or recursive methods, but that might be more complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps using multinomial coefficients.

Wait, but I think the way I've approached it is correct.

So, the number of paths is 2 * [C(7,2)*C(7,1)] = 294.

So, the final answer is 294.


To solve the problem of counting the number of paths from the lower left corner to the upper right corner of an 8×8 grid that change direction exactly four times, we analyze the structure of such paths. Each path consists of 8 right (R) moves and 8 up (U) moves, totaling 16 steps. Changing direction exactly four times implies the path has 5 runs (consecutive sequences of the same direction). These runs alternate between R and U, starting with either R or U.

### Case 1: Starting with R
- The path has 3 R runs and 2 U runs.
- The number of ways to split 8 R's into 3 runs is \( \binom{7}{2} = 21 \).
- The number of ways to split 8 U's into 2 runs is \( \binom{7}{1} = 7 \).
- Total paths for this case: \( 21 \times 7 = 147 \).

### Case 2: Starting with U
- The path has 3 U runs and 2 R runs.
- The number of ways to split 8 U's into 3 runs is \( \binom{7}{2} = 21 \).
- The number of ways to split 8 R's into 2 runs is \( \binom{7}{1} = 7 \).
- Total paths for this case: \( 21 \times 7 = 147 \).

### Total Paths
Adding the paths from both cases gives the total number of paths:
\[ 147 + 147 = 294 \]

Thus, the number of paths that change direction exactly four times is:

\boxed{294}
