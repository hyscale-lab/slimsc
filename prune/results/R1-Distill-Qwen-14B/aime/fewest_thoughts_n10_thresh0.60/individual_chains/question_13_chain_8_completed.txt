Alright, so I've got this math problem here about Aya's morning walks. Let me try to parse it step by step. Okay, Aya walks 9 kilometers every morning and then stops at a coffee shop. There are two different scenarios given regarding her walking speed and the time it takes, including the coffee shop time. I need to find out how many minutes her walk takes when she walks at a speed of s + 1/2 km/h, including the t minutes in the coffee shop.

Hmm, okay, let's break this down. First, let me note the given information.

In the first scenario, she walks at a constant speed of s km/h, and the total time taken is 4 hours. This includes t minutes spent in the coffee shop. Wait, so the total time is 4 hours, which would be 240 minutes, and out of that, t minutes are spent in the coffee shop. That means the time she actually spends walking is 240 - t minutes, or in hours, that would be (240 - t)/60 hours. Because 60 minutes equal 1 hour. So, the walking time is (240 - t)/60 hours.

Wait, but she walks 9 kilometers. So, the formula for time is distance divided by speed. So, the walking time should be 9 / s hours. So, I can set up an equation.

So, first equation: 9 / s = (240 - t)/60.

Wait, let me write that again.

Walking time at speed s is distance divided by speed: 9/s. But this walking time plus the coffee shop time t minutes equals 4 hours. So, 9/s + t/60 = 4. Because t is in minutes, which is t/60 hours.

Alternatively, the total time is 4 hours, and the time she spends walking is 9/s hours, so the coffee shop time is 4 - (9/s) hours, which is in minutes, 60*(4 - (9/s)) minutes. But maybe it's better to keep everything in hours to avoid confusion.

So, equation 1: 9/s + t/60 = 4.

Wait, no. Wait, no, t is in minutes, so to represent t in hours, it's t/60. So, the total time is coffee shop time plus walking time. So, walking time is 9/s hours, coffee time is t/60 hours, sum is 4 hours.

Yes, correct. So, 9/s + t/60 = 4.

Similarly, in the second scenario, she walks at s + 2 km/h, and the total time is 2 hours and 24 minutes. Let me convert that to hours. 24 minutes is 24/60 = 0.4 hours, so total time is 2.4 hours.

So, equation 2: 9/(s + 2) + t/60 = 2.4.

So now I have two equations:

1) 9/s + t/60 = 4

2) 9/(s + 2) + t/60 = 2.4

Hmm, okay. So, these are two equations with two variables, s and t. I can solve them simultaneously.

Let me subtract equation 2 from equation 1 to eliminate t. So:

[9/s + t/60] - [9/(s + 2) + t/60] = 4 - 2.4

Simplify:

9/s - 9/(s + 2) = 1.6

So, 9*(1/s - 1/(s + 2)) = 1.6

Let me compute 1/s - 1/(s + 2). That's equal to [(s + 2) - s]/(s(s + 2)) ) = 2/(s(s + 2)).

So, 9*(2)/(s(s + 2)) = 1.6

Simplify: 18 / [s(s + 2)] = 1.6

Let me write that as 18 = 1.6 * s(s + 2)

So, 18 = 1.6 s^2 + 3.2 s

Let me rearrange this as a quadratic equation:

1.6 s^2 + 3.2 s - 18 = 0

Hmm, maybe I can multiply both sides by 10 to eliminate the decimals:

16 s^2 + 32 s - 180 = 0

Simplify by dividing all terms by 4:

4 s^2 + 8 s - 45 = 0

So, 4s^2 + 8s - 45 = 0.

Let me try to solve this quadratic equation. Using the quadratic formula:

s = [-8 ± sqrt(8^2 - 4 *4*(-45))]/(2*4)

Compute discriminant D:

D = 64 + 720 = 784

sqrt(784) = 28

So, s = [ -8 ± 28 ] / 8

So, two solutions:

s = (20)/8 = 2.5

s = (-36)/8 = -4.5

But speed can't be negative, so s = 2.5 km/h.

So, Aya's original walking speed is 2.5 km/h.

Now, let's find t. Using equation 1:

9/s + t/60 = 4

s is 2.5, so 9 / 2.5 = 3.6 hours.

So:

3.6 + t/60 = 4

t/60 = 0.4

t = 0.4 * 60 = 24 minutes.

So, she spends 24 minutes in the coffee shop each time.

Now, the question is, when she walks at s + 1/2 km/h. So, s is 2.5, so s + 1/2 is 2.5 + 0.5 = 3 km/h.

So, her walking speed is now 3 km/h.

Compute the total time for the walk, including t minutes.

First, compute the walking time: 9 km / 3 km/h = 3 hours.

Then, add t minutes. Since t is 24 minutes, which is 24 minutes.

So, total time is 3 hours and 24 minutes.

But the question says to include t minutes, which is 24 minutes. So, the total time is 3 hours and 24 minutes. They want the answer in minutes, so 3*60 +24 = 180 +24 = 204 minutes.

Wait, but let me verify. Because maybe I made a mistake.

Wait, in the problem statement, when she walks at s km/h, the total time is 4 hours including t minutes. So, the coffee time is t minutes, and the walking time is 9/s hours.

So, when she walks at 3 km/h, the walking time is 9/3 = 3 hours. So, 3 hours, plus 24 minutes, so 3 hours 24 minutes, which is 204 minutes.

Yes, that makes sense.

Alternatively, let me check with equation 2 to see if t is correctly found.

Equation 2: 9/(s + 2) + t/60 = 2.4

s is 2.5, so s + 2 = 4.5 km/h.

So, 9 /4.5 = 2 hours.

So, 2 + t/60 = 2.4

t/60 = 0.4

t = 24 minutes. Yep, that's correct.

So, when she walks at s + 1/2 km/h, which is 3 km/h, her walking time is 9/3 = 3 hours, plus 24 minutes. So total time is 3 hours 24 minutes, which is 204 minutes.

So, the answer should be 204 minutes.


To solve the problem, we start by setting up equations based on the given information.

1. When Aya walks at speed \( s \) km/h, the total time is 4 hours, which includes \( t \) minutes in the coffee shop. Thus, the walking time is \( \frac{9}{s} \) hours, and the coffee shop time is \( \frac{t}{60} \) hours. The equation is:
   \[
   \frac{9}{s} + \frac{t}{60} = 4
   \]

2. When she walks at \( s + 2 \) km/h, the total time is 2 hours and 24 minutes, which is 2.4 hours. The equation is:
   \[
   \frac{9}{s + 2} + \frac{t}{60} = 2.4
   \]

Subtracting the second equation from the first to eliminate \( t \):
\[
\frac{9}{s} - \frac{9}{s + 2} = 1.6
\]
Simplifying:
\[
9 \left( \frac{1}{s} - \frac{1}{s + 2} \right) = 1.6
\]
\[
9 \left( \frac{2}{s(s + 2)} \right) = 1.6
\]
\[
\frac{18}{s(s + 2)} = 1.6
\]
\[
18 = 1.6s(s + 2)
\]
\[
16s^2 + 32s - 180 = 0
\]
Solving the quadratic equation:
\[
s = 2.5 \, \text{km/h}
\]
Substituting \( s = 2.5 \) into the first equation to find \( t \):
\[
\frac{9}{2.5} + \frac{t}{60} = 4
\]
\[
3.6 + \frac{t}{60} = 4
\]
\[
\frac{t}{60} = 0.4
\]
\[
t = 24 \, \text{minutes}
\]

When Aya walks at \( s + \frac{1}{2} = 3 \) km/h, the walking time is:
\[
\frac{9}{3} = 3 \, \text{hours} = 180 \, \text{minutes}
\]
Including the coffee shop time of 24 minutes, the total time is:
\[
180 + 24 = 204 \, \text{minutes}
\]

The final answer is:
\[
\boxed{204}
\]
