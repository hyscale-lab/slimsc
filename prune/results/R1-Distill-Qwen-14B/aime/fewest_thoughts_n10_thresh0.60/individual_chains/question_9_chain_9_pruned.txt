Okay, so I have this problem here: There are real numbers x and y, both greater than 1, such that log base x of y^x is 10, and log base y of x^{4y} is also 10. I need to find the product xy. Hmm, that's interesting. I'm a bit rusty on logarithms, but let's see if I can work this out.

First, let me write down the given equations to make it clearer. 

The first equation is:
log_x(y^x) = 10

And the second equation is:
log_y(x^{4y}) = 10

Alright, so both of these logarithms equal 10. I remember that log_b(a) = c is equivalent to b^c = a. Maybe I can use that property to rewrite these equations in exponential form. Let's try that.

Starting with the first equation:
log_x(y^x) = 10
This means that x^10 = y^x.

Similarly, the second equation:
log_y(x^{4y}) = 10
Which means y^10 = x^{4y}.

So now I have two equations:
1) x^10 = y^x
2) y^10 = x^{4y}

Hmm, okay. So I have two equations with x and y. Maybe I can express one variable in terms of the other and substitute.

Looking at equation 1: x^10 = y^x. Maybe I can solve for y in terms of x. Let's take the natural logarithm of both sides to make it easier.

Taking ln on both sides:
ln(x^10) = ln(y^x)
Which simplifies to:
10 ln x = x ln y
So, 10 ln x = x ln y.

Similarly, for equation 2: y^10 = x^{4y}
Taking ln:
ln(y^10) = ln(x^{4y})
Which gives:
10 ln y = 4y ln x

So now, from equation 1:
10 ln x = x ln y  => equation (A)

From equation 2:
10 ln y = 4y ln x  => equation (B)

Hmm, so I have two equations now involving ln x and ln y. Maybe I can express ln y from equation (A) and substitute into equation (B).

From equation (A):
ln y = (10 ln x)/x

Plugging this into equation (B):
10 * (10 ln x / x) = 4y ln x

Simplify the left side:
(100 ln x)/x = 4y ln x

Assuming ln x is not zero (which it can't be because x > 1, so ln x > 0), we can divide both sides by ln x:
100/x = 4y

So,
100/x = 4y
Which simplifies to:
y = (100)/(4x) = 25/x

So, y equals 25/x. That's useful. Now, let's substitute y = 25/x into equation (A) or (B) to find x.

Wait, equation (A) is 10 ln x = x ln y, and since y =25/x, ln y = ln(25/x) = ln25 - ln x.

So substituting into equation (A):
10 ln x = x (ln25 - ln x)

Let me write that out:
10 ln x = x ln25 - x ln x

Bring all terms to one side:
10 ln x + x ln x - x ln25 = 0

Factor ln x from the first two terms:
ln x (10 + x) - x ln25 = 0

Hmm, that's a bit complicated. Let me rearrange it:
ln x (10 + x) = x ln25

So,
ln x = [x ln25] / (10 + x)

Alternatively, I can write this as:
ln x = [x ln25]/(x + 10)

Hmm, not sure if that directly helps. Maybe I can express this as a function and try to find x numerically, but perhaps there's a smarter substitution.

Wait, let me think. From y =25/x, let's substitute that into equation 1: x^10 = y^x.

So, x^10 = (25/x)^x

Which can be written as:
x^10 = 25^x / x^x

Multiply both sides by x^x:
x^{10 + x} = 25^x

So, x^{x + 10} = 25^x

Hmm, that's x^{x+10} = (5^2)^x =5^{2x}

So, x^{x +10} =5^{2x}

Taking natural logs on both sides:
(x +10) ln x = 2x ln5

This gives:
(x +10) ln x = 2x ln5

Hmm, still a bit tricky, but perhaps I can rearrange it.

Let me divide both sides by x (since x>1, so xâ‰ 0):
(1 + 10/x) ln x = 2 ln5

So,
(1 + 10/x) ln x = 2 ln5

Hmm, maybe I can set t = x, so I have an equation in terms of t:

(t + 10/t) ln t = 2 ln5

Not sure if that helps directly, but maybe I can try some integer values for x to see if they satisfy the equation.

Wait, 25 is a square number, and 5 is a prime. Maybe x is a multiple or power of 5. Let me test x=5.

If x=5, then y=25/5=5.

So, let's check equation 1: log_5(5^5) = log_5(3125) =5
