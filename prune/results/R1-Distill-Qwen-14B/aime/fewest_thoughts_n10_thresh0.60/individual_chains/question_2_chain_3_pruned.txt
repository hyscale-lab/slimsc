Okay, so I have this problem here with points O, A, and B. O is at (0,0), which is the origin. A is at (1/2, 0), so that's halfway along the x-axis between O and (1,0). B is at (0, sqrt(3)/2), so that's somewhere up the y-axis, since sqrt(3)/2 is approximately 0.866. 

The problem says that there's a family F of segments PQ, each of length 1, lying in the first quadrant. Each P is on the x-axis, and Q is on the y-axis. So, like, for each segment PQ, P is somewhere on the x-axis, Q is somewhere on the y-axis, and the distance between them is 1. Since they're in the first quadrant, both coordinates of P and Q are positive.

Now, the task is to find a unique point C on segment AB, which is not A or B, that doesn't lie on any other segment from family F except for AB itself. Then we need to find OC squared, which is the square of the distance from the origin to this point C. The answer should be in the form p/q where p and q are coprime, and then compute p + q.

Hmm, okay. So, I think the first step is to figure out what the family F of segments PQ looks like. Each PQ is a unit length segment with P on the x-axis and Q on the y-axis. Let me denote P as (p, 0) and Q as (0, q). Then, the distance between P and Q is sqrt((p)^2 + (q)^2) = 1. So, p^2 + q^2 = 1.

But since each PQ is a segment in the first quadrant, p and q are positive. So, for each p between 0 and 1, q would be sqrt(1 - p^2), right? So, the family F consists of all such line segments PQ where P is (p, 0) and Q is (0, sqrt(1 - p^2)) for p in (0,1).

Wait, but the problem says segments in the first quadrant, so maybe p and q can be anything as long as they're positive. But since the distance is 1, p and q are determined by that equation.

Now, the point C is on AB, and it's the only point on AB (other than A and B) that doesn't lie on any other segment from F except AB. So, AB is one of these segments in F. Because A is (1/2, 0) and B is (0, sqrt(3)/2). Let's check the distance between A and B: sqrt[(1/2)^2 + (sqrt(3)/2)^2] = sqrt[1/4 + 3/4] = sqrt[1] = 1. So, AB is indeed a segment in F.

So, AB is one of the segments in F, and C is a point on AB such that it's not on any other segment from F. So, we need to find such a point C on AB that is only intersected by AB among all segments in F.

So, perhaps C is the point on AB that is the "closest" to the origin? Or maybe it's the point where AB is tangent to some curve related to F?

Alternatively, maybe the point C is where AB is the only segment in F that passes through it. So, any other segment PQ in F doesn't pass through C.

Wait, so for C to be unique, it must satisfy that the only segment from F passing through it is AB. So, C can't lie on any other PQ from F.

So, perhaps we can parametrize AB and find a point C on AB that doesn't lie on any other PQ in F.

Let me parametrize AB. Let's find the equation of AB first.

Points A (1/2, 0) and B (0, sqrt(3)/2). So, the slope of AB is (sqrt(3)/2 - 0)/(0 - 1/2) = (sqrt(3)/2) / (-1/2) = -sqrt(3). So, the equation is y = -sqrt(3)x + c. Plugging in A: 0 = -sqrt(3)*(1/2) + c => c = sqrt(3)/2. So, equation of AB is y = -sqrt(3)x + sqrt(3)/2.

Alternatively, we can write parametric equations for AB. Let parameter t go from 0 to 1. So, x = (1/2)(1 - t), y = (sqrt(3)/2) * t. So, when t=0, we are at A, and t=1, we are at B.

So, point C on AB can be expressed as ( (1/2)(1 - t), (sqrt(3)/2) t ) for some t between 0 and 1.

Now, we need to find C such that C is not on any other segment PQ in F except AB.

So, suppose that C lies on another segment PQ, where P is (p, 0) and Q is (0, q), with p^2 + q^2 =1.

Then, the equation of PQ is x/p + y/q = 1.

So, point C lies on PQ, so substituting the coordinates of C into this equation:

[ (1/2)(1 - t) ] / p + [ (sqrt(3)/2) t ] / q = 1.

But since p^2 + q^2 =1, so q = sqrt(1 - p^2).

So, the equation becomes:

( (1 - t)/2 ) / p + ( (sqrt(3) t)/2 ) / sqrt(1 - p^2) = 1.

We need to find t such that this equation is only satisfied when p corresponds to AB. Wait, but AB is itself a segment in F, so when p = 1/2, q = sqrt(3)/2, which
