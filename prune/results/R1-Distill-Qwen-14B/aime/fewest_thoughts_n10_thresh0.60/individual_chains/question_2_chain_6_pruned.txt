Okay, so I have this geometry problem here. Let me try to parse it out step by step. 

We have three points: O at (0,0), which is the origin; A at (1/2, 0), so that's on the x-axis halfway between O and (1,0); and B at (0, sqrt(3)/2), which is on the y-axis. So O is the origin, A is halfway along the x-axis, and B is somewhere up the y-axis, but less than 1 unit since sqrt(3)/2 is approximately 0.866.

The family F consists of segments PQ of unit length lying in the first quadrant, with P on the x-axis and Q on the y-axis. So each segment PQ is a line segment from the x-axis to the y-axis, length 1, in the first quadrant. So for each such segment, P is (p, 0) and Q is (0, q), with p and q positive real numbers, and the distance between P and Q is 1. So the distance formula gives sqrt(p² + q²) = 1, meaning p² + q² = 1.

So all these PQ segments are chords of the unit circle in the first quadrant, connecting the x and y axes. So the family F is all such segments from (p,0) to (0,q) where p² + q² = 1.

Now, the problem says there is a unique point C on segment AB, distinct from A and B, that does not belong to any segment from F other than AB. So AB is one of these segments in F, I suppose. So AB is a segment from (1/2, 0) to (0, sqrt(3)/2), and the length of AB is 1? Let me check that.

Distance between A and B: sqrt[(1/2)^2 + (sqrt(3)/2)^2] = sqrt[1/4 + 3/4] = sqrt[1] = 1. Yes, AB is a unit segment, so it's in F.

So, we need to find point C on AB such that C is not on any other segment from F besides AB. So, for this point C, there's no other PQ in F (other than AB) that passes through C.

So, the strategy is probably to parametrize point C on AB and then find the conditions under which it doesn't lie on any other PQ from F.

First, let's find the parametric equation of AB. Since A is (1/2, 0) and B is (0, sqrt(3)/2), the vector from A to B is (-1/2, sqrt(3)/2). So parametrizing AB: a point C can be written as A + t*(B - A), where t ranges from 0 to 1.

So, C = (1/2, 0) + t*(-1/2, sqrt(3)/2) = (1/2 - t/2, 0 + t*sqrt(3)/2). So, in terms of coordinates, C is ( (1 - t)/2, (t sqrt(3))/2 ).

Alternatively, we can express C as (x, y) where x = (1 - t)/2 and y = (t sqrt(3))/2. So, if we eliminate t, we can write y = sqrt(3) x. Because from x = (1 - t)/2, t = 1 - 2x; plug into y: y = sqrt(3)/2*(1 - 2x). Wait, that would give y = (sqrt(3)/2) - sqrt(3) x. Alternatively, maybe I should just recognize that AB is a line segment from (1/2, 0) to (0, sqrt(3)/2), so its slope is (sqrt(3)/2 - 0)/(0 - 1/2) = (sqrt(3)/2)/(-1/2) = -sqrt(3). So the equation of AB is y = -sqrt(3)(x - 1/2). So y = -sqrt(3) x + sqrt(3)/2.

Wait, that seems correct. Let me check with point A: x = 1/2, y = 0. Plug in: y = -sqrt(3)*(1/2) + sqrt(3)/2 = (-sqrt(3)/2 + sqrt(3)/2) = 0. Correct. For point B: x=0, y= sqrt(3)/2. Plug in: y=0 + sqrt(3)/2. Correct. So AB is y = -sqrt(3)x + sqrt(3)/2.

So any point on AB is (x, y) such that y = -sqrt(3)x + sqrt(3)/2, with x between 0 and 1/2.

Now, we need to find point C on AB (so (x, y) as above) that is not on any other segment PQ in F except AB.

So, for any other PQ in F (other than AB), which is a segment from (p, 0) to (0, q), with p² + q² = 1, the point
