Okay, so I'm trying to solve this problem where Alice and Bob play a game with a stack of n tokens. They take turns removing either 1 or 4 tokens. The person who takes the last token wins. I need to find how many positive integers n ≤ 2024 allow Bob to have a winning strategy, regardless of how Alice plays.

Hmm, okay. Let me think about how to approach this. It seems like a combinatorial game theory problem. I remember that these types of problems often involve finding winning and losing positions. A winning position is one where the current player can force a win no matter what the opponent does, while a losing position is the opposite.

So, in this case, Alice starts first. If the initial number of tokens n is a winning position, then Alice can force a win. But the problem is asking for the number of n where Bob can guarantee a win regardless of Alice's moves. That means for those n, the starting position is a losing position for Alice, meaning Bob can always respond in a way that leads Alice into another losing position, eventually forcing her to take the last token or something.

Wait, actually, no. Wait, the person who takes the last token wins. So, if the starting position is a losing position for the first player (Alice), then the second player (Bob) can win. So, I need to find all n ≤ 2024 where the starting position is a losing position for Alice. Thus, Bob can win.

So, the key is to find all losing positions n. Then, count how many such n are ≤ 2024.

How do we determine the losing positions? Let's think about the game and model it.

Let me denote a position as losing if the player whose turn it is cannot force a win, assuming the opponent plays optimally. So, for n=0, that's a losing position because there are no tokens to take. But wait, in the game, the player who takes the last token wins. So, if n=0, the game is already over, meaning the previous player took the last token and won. So, for n=0, the current player can't move and thus loses.

So, starting from n=0 as a losing position, let's try to find the pattern.

We can model this recursively. For a given n, if the current player can make a move that forces the opponent into a losing position, then n is a winning position. Otherwise, it's a losing position.

So, let's define:

- If from n, a player can move to a losing position for the opponent (i.e., n-1 or n-4 is a losing position), then n is a winning position.

- If all possible moves (n-1 and n-4) lead to winning positions for the opponent, then n is a losing position.

But wait, for some n, the player can choose to take 1 or 4 tokens. So, for each n, we need to check both possibilities.

Let me try to list out the positions step by step, starting from n=0.

n=0: losing (base case)

n=1: The player can take 1 token, leaving n=0, which is a losing position for the opponent. So, n=1 is a winning position.

n=2: The player can take 1, leaving n
