Okay, so I've got this problem here where I need to find the number of rectangles that can be formed inside a regular dodecagon (which is a 12-sided polygon). Each side of the rectangle has to lie on either a side or a diagonal of the dodecagon. Hmm, interesting. I remember that in regular polygons, especially those with many sides, there are various diagonals and sides that can form different shapes like triangles, quadrilaterals, pentagons, and in this case, rectangles.

First, I should probably visualize a regular dodecagon. It's a 12-sided polygon with all sides equal and all internal angles equal. Since it's regular, it's also convex, meaning all the vertices point outward. Now, the problem mentions that each side of the rectangle lies on a side or a diagonal of the dodecagon. So, the sides of the rectangle are either sides of the dodecagon or its diagonals. 

I think the key here is to figure out how these sides and diagonals can form rectangles. Rectangles have opposite sides equal and all angles 90 degrees. In a regular polygon, especially a dodecagon, the sides are all equal, but the diagonals can vary in length depending on how many vertices they skip. So, for example, in a dodecagon, a side connects two adjacent vertices, a diagonal could connect a vertex to the one two steps away, three steps, etc., up to five steps because beyond that, the diagonals start repeating on the other side.

Wait, why up to five steps? Because in a 12-gon, each vertex is connected to 11 others. So, the diagonals can be categorized by how many vertices they skip. For instance, skipping 1 vertex gives a diagonal, skipping 2 vertices gives another, and so on. But since after skipping 6 vertices, you end up with the same as the other side, right? Because 12/2 =6. So, the maximum unique skip is 5. Hence, diagonals can skip 1,2,3,4,5 vertices.

But how does this help in forming rectangles? Well, a rectangle has four sides, with opposite sides equal and all angles 90 degrees. So, in the dodecagon, to form a rectangle, we need four lines (sides or diagonals) that intersect at right angles, forming a four-sided figure with opposite sides equal.

Wait, but the sides of the rectangle lie on the sides or diagonals of the dodecagon. So, each side of the rectangle is either a side or a diagonal of the dodecagon. That means each side of the rectangle is a chord of the dodecagon's circumcircle. So, perhaps the rectangles are formed by four such chords that intersect at right angles.

Alternatively, maybe the rectangle is defined by four points on the dodecagon, such that the sides of the rectangle are chords between these points, and these chords are either sides or diagonals of the dodecagon.

Wait, perhaps another approach: in a regular polygon, the sides and diagonals can be thought of as vectors from the center. Since it's regular, all sides and diagonals are symmetric with respect to the center.

But perhaps it's better to think in terms of coordinates. Let me assign coordinates to the dodecagon. Let me imagine it inscribed in a unit circle. Each vertex can be represented as (cos θ, sin θ), where θ is the angle from the positive x-axis. For a regular dodecagon, the vertices are at angles of 0°, 30°, 60°, ..., up to 330°.

So, the coordinates of the vertices are (cos(k*30°), sin(k*30°)) for k from 0 to 11.

Now, any rectangle inside the dodecagon must have its sides aligned along certain chords. Since the sides of the rectangle must lie on chords (sides or diagonals) of the dodecagon, the sides of the rectangle are chords of the dodecagon.

Moreover, in a rectangle, opposite sides are equal and all angles are 90 degrees. So, perhaps the vectors representing the sides of the rectangle must be perpendicular.

Wait, but in a regular dodecagon, not all chords are perpendicular. So, for two chords to be perpendicular, their corresponding angles must differ by 90 degrees, right?

Hmm, maybe I should think in terms of vectors. Let me consider two vectors from the center to two vertices. The angle between these two vectors is θ. The chord connecting these two vertices would have a length determined
