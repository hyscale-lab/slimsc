Okay, so I have this problem here: I need to find the greatest four-digit number N such that if any one of its digits is changed to 1, the resulting number is divisible by 7. Then, I have to find Q + R where Q is the quotient and R is the remainder when N is divided by 1000.

Hmm, let's break this down. N is a four-digit number, so it ranges from 1000 to 9999. I need the largest such N. 

The key property is that changing any single digit to 1 makes the number divisible by 7. That means for each digit in N (thousands, hundreds, tens, ones), replacing it with 1 should result in a number divisible by 7.

So, let's denote the four-digit number N as ABCD, where A, B, C, D are its digits. So, N = 1000A + 100B + 10C + D.

Now, if I replace A with 1, the number becomes 1BCD. Similarly, replacing B gives A1CD, replacing C gives AB1D, and replacing D gives ABC1.

Each of these modified numbers must be divisible by 7. So, for each modified number, we have:

1. 1BCD ≡ 0 mod 7
2. A1CD ≡ 0 mod 7
3. AB1D ≡ 0 mod 7
4. ABC1 ≡ 0 mod 7

I need to find the largest N (ABCD) satisfying all four conditions.

Since N is the greatest such number, I should start checking from 9999 downwards until I find one that meets all these conditions.

But that might take a lot of time. Maybe I can find a smarter approach by considering the conditions.

Let me think about each digit and how changing it affects divisibility by 7.

First, let's consider the conditions one by one.

1. When A is replaced by 1, the number 1BCD must be divisible by 7. So, 1000 + 100B + 10C + D ≡ 0 mod 7.

2. When B is replaced by 1, the number A1CD must be divisible by 7. So, 1000A + 100 + 10C + D ≡ 0 mod 7.

3. When C is replaced by 1, the number AB1D must be divisible by 7. So, 1000A + 100B + 10 + D ≡ 0 mod 7.

4. When D is replaced by 1, the number ABC1 must be divisible by 7. So, 1000A + 100B + 10C + 1 ≡ 0 mod 7.

So, all four of these expressions must be congruent to 0 modulo 7.

Let me note that N is ABCD = 1000A + 100B + 10C + D.

So, N ≡ 1000A + 100B + 10C + D mod 7.

But 1000 mod 7 is 1000 / 7 = 142*7 + 6, so 1000 ≡ 6 mod 7.

Similarly, 100 mod 7 is 2, 10 mod 7 is 3, and 1 mod 7 is 1.

So, N ≡ 6A + 2B + 3C + D mod 7.

Similarly, the modified numbers:

1. 1BCD ≡ 6*1 + 2B + 3C + D ≡ 6 + 2B + 3C + D ≡ 0 mod 7.

2. A1CD ≡ 6A + 2*1 + 3C + D ≡ 6A + 2 + 3C + D ≡ 0 mod 7.

3. AB1D ≡ 6A + 2B + 3*1 + D ≡ 6A + 2B + 3 + D ≡ 0 mod 7.

4. ABC1 ≡ 6A + 2B + 3C + 1 ≡ 0 mod 7.

So, now we have four equations:

1. 6 + 2B + 3C + D ≡ 0 mod 7.  --> Equation (1)
2. 6A + 2 + 3C + D ≡ 0 mod 7. --> Equation (2)
3. 6A + 2B + 3 + D ≡ 0 mod 7. --> Equation (3)
4. 6A + 2B + 3C + 1 ≡ 0 mod 7. --> Equation (4)

And N itself is 6A + 2B + 3C + D ≡ k mod 7, where k is some value.

Wait, but Equation (4) is N ≡ -1 mod 7 because Equation (4) is N +1 ≡0 mod7. So, N ≡ -1 ≡ 6 mod7.

So, N ≡6 mod7.

But I don't know yet, but maybe this can help.

Let me see the four equations.

Equation (1): 6 + 2B + 3C + D ≡0 mod7.

Equation (2): 6A + 2 + 3C + D ≡0 mod7.

Equation (3): 6A + 2B + 3 + D ≡0 mod7.

Equation (4): 6A + 2B + 3C + 1 ≡0 mod7.

So, let's write these as:

Equation (1): (2B + 3C + D) ≡ -6 ≡ 1 mod7. Because 6 ≡ -1 mod7, so -6 ≡1.

Wait, 6 mod7 is 6, so 6 ≡6 mod7. So, equation (1): 2B + 3C + D ≡ -6 mod7 → 2B + 3C + D ≡1 mod7.

Equation (2): 6A + 3C + D ≡ -2 mod7. Since 2 ≡2, so -2 ≡5 mod7.

Equation (3): 6A + 2B + D ≡ -3 mod7. Because 3 ≡3, so -3 ≡4 mod7.

Equation (4): 6
