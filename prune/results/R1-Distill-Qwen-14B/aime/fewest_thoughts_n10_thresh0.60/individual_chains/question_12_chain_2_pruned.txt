Okay, so I've got this problem here about filling a 2x3 grid with digits. The conditions are that when you read the numbers left to right for each row, their sum should be 999. And when you read the numbers top to bottom for each column, their sum should be 99. Hmm, let me try to visualize this.

First, the grid is 2 rows by 3 columns. So, each row will form a 3-digit number, and each column will form a 2-digit number. Let me denote the grid like this:

```
a b c
d e f
```

So, the top row is a, b, c, which forms the number 100a + 10b + c. The bottom row is d, e, f, forming 100d + 10e + f. When we add these two numbers together, it should equal 999. So, equation one is:

100a + 10b + c + 100d + 10e + f = 999.

Now, the columns: the first column is a and d, forming 10a + d. The second column is b and e, forming 10b + e. The third column is c and f, forming 10c + f. Their sum should be 99. So, equation two is:

(10a + d) + (10b + e) + (10c + f) = 99.

Let me write down these two equations:

1. (100a + 10b + c) + (100d + 10e + f) = 999
2. (10a + d) + (10b + e) + (10c + f) = 99

Hmm, maybe I can express these equations in terms of variables. Let me assign some variables to the rows and columns. Let me call the top row number as X = 100a + 10b + c, and the bottom row number as Y = 100d + 10e + f. So equation 1 becomes X + Y = 999.

For the columns, let me denote each column as C1, C2, C3. So C1 = 10a + d, C2 = 10b + e, C3 = 10c + f. Then equation 2 is C1 + C2 + C3 = 99.

But there's another way to look at equation 2. Let me expand it:

10a + d + 10b + e + 10c + f = 99.

Which can be rearranged as 10(a + b + c) + (d + e + f) = 99.

Wait, but from equation 1, X + Y = 999. Since X is 100a + 10b + c, and Y is 100d + 10e + f, if I add them:

X + Y = (100a + 10b + c) + (100d + 10e + f) = 100(a + d) + 10(b + e) + (c + f) = 999.

But 999 is a 3-digit number. Hmm. Let me see if I can relate equation 1 and equation 2.

Wait, in equation 2, 10(a + b + c) + (d + e + f) = 99. Let me denote S = a + b + c, T = d + e + f. So equation 2 becomes 10S + T = 99.

Which implies that S is the tens digit and T is the units digit of 99. Since 99 is 9*10 + 9, that would mean S = 9 and T = 9. So, S = a + b + c = 9, and T = d + e + f = 9.

So, from equation 2, I have a + b + c = 9 and d + e + f = 9.

Now, equation 1 is X + Y = 999, where X = 100a + 10b + c and Y = 100d + 10e + f.

Let me think about the relationship between X and Y. Since X + Y = 999, which is 1000 - 1. So, X + Y = 1000 - 1. Hmm, but X is a 3-digit number, as is Y.

Wait, maybe I can write X = 999 - Y. But that might not help directly. Alternatively, perhaps I can express X + Y in terms of the digits. Let's see:

X + Y = (100a + 10b + c) + (100d + 10e + f) = 100(a + d) + 10(b + e) + (c + f) = 999.

So, 100(a
