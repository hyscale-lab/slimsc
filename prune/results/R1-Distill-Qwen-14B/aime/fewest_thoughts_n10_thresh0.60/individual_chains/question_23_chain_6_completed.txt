Okay, so I have this problem where there's a hyperbola given by the equation x²/20 - y²/24 = 1. Points A, B, C, D lie on this hyperbola, forming a rhombus ABCD. The diagonals of this rhombus intersect at the origin. I need to find the greatest real number that is less than BD² for all such rhombi. Hmm, okay.

First, let me recall some properties. A rhombus has all sides equal, and its diagonals bisect each other at right angles. Wait, no, actually, in a rhombus, the diagonals bisect each other and bisect the angles, but they aren't necessarily perpendicular unless it's a square. Wait, no, actually, in a rhombus, the diagonals are not necessarily perpendicular unless it's a square. Wait, no, actually, yes, in a rhombus, the diagonals are perpendicular bisectors of each other. Wait, I think that's correct. So, in a rhombus, the diagonals are perpendicular and bisect each other.

So, since the diagonals intersect at the origin, that would mean that the origin is the midpoint of both diagonals. So, if A is a point (x, y), then the opposite vertex C would be (-x, -y), right? Similarly, the other two points B and D would be such that they are also symmetric with respect to the origin. So, if B is (p, q), then D is (-p, -q). So, the four points are A(x, y), B(p, q), C(-x, -y), D(-p, -q).

Now, since ABCD is a rhombus, all sides are equal. So, the distance between A and B should be equal to the distance between B and C, and so on.

But maybe there's a better way to approach this. Let me think about parametric equations for the hyperbola. The given hyperbola is x²/20 - y²/24 = 1, which is a standard hyperbola centered at the origin, opening left and right.

Parametrizing the hyperbola, I can use hyperbolic functions. Let me recall that for a hyperbola x²/a² - y²/b² = 1, a parametrization is (a sec θ, b tan θ). Alternatively, sometimes people use (a cosh t, b sinh t). Wait, but for hyperbola, the parametrization using trigonometric functions isn't periodic, but hyperbolic functions are. I think the standard parametrization is (a sec θ, b tan θ), similar to an ellipse's parametrization but with sec and tan.

So, let me use that. Let me denote point A as (a sec θ, b tan θ), where a² = 20 and b² =24. So, a = sqrt(20) = 2*sqrt(5), and b = sqrt(24) = 2*sqrt(6). So, A is (2√5 sec θ, 2√6 tan θ).

Since the points A, B, C, D form a rhombus with diagonals intersecting at the origin, and the diagonals are AC and BD. So, the other two points B and D must be such that their midpoint is the origin, just like A and C.

But in a rhombus, the diagonals are perpendicular. So, the vectors AC and BD must be perpendicular. Also, since diagonals bisect each other, their midpoints are the same.

Wait, but I think the diagonals of the rhombus are AC and BD, so their midpoints are both the origin. So, the coordinates of A and C are opposite points, as I thought earlier.

Similarly, points B and D are opposite points.

So, perhaps it's better to think of this in terms of vectors. Let me denote vectors OA, OB, OC, OD as vectors from the origin to points A, B, C, D.

Since ABCD is a rhombus, the vectors OA and OB should satisfy certain conditions.

Wait, in a rhombus, the diagonals bisect each other and are perpendicular. So, the diagonals AC and BD are perpendicular. So, the vectors AC and BD are perpendicular.

Wait, but AC is the vector from A to C, which is (-2x, -2y) if A is (x, y). Similarly, BD is the vector from B to D, which is (-2p, -2q) if B is (p, q). So, the vectors AC and BD are scalar multiples of (-x, -y) and (-p, -q), respectively.

But for the diagonals to be perpendicular, their dot product must be zero. So, AC · BD = 0.

So, let me write that down. Vector AC is from A to C: C - A = (-2x, -2y). Similarly, vector BD is D - B = (-2p, -2q). So, their dot product is (-2x)(-2p) + (-2y)(-2q) = 4xp + 4yq. This must be equal to zero because they're perpendicular.

So, 4xp + 4yq = 0 => xp + yq = 0.

So, that's one condition.

Also, since all sides are equal in a rhombus, the distance from A to B must be equal to the distance from B to C, etc. Let's write that down.

So, distance AB = distance BC = distance CD = distance DA.

Let me compute these distances.

Distance AB: sqrt[(p - x)^2 + (q - y)^2]

Distance BC: sqrt[(-x - p)^2 + (-y - q)^2]

Since AB = BC, their squares must be equal.

So,

(p - x)^2 + (q - y)^2 = (-x - p)^2 + (-y - q)^2

Let me expand both sides.

Left side: (p² - 2px + x²) + (q² - 2qy + y²) = p² + x² - 2px + q² + y² - 2qy

Right side: (x² + 2px + p²) + (y² + 2qy + q²) = x² + p² + y² + q² + 2px + 2qy

Set them equal:

p² + x² - 2px + q² + y² - 2qy = x² + p² + y² + q² + 2px + 2qy

Subtract the common terms from both sides:

-2px - 2qy = 2px + 2qy

Bring all terms to left:

-2px - 2qy - 2px - 2qy = 0 => -4px -4qy = 0 => -4(px + qy) = 0 => px + qy = 0

Wait, but earlier I had xp + yq = 0 from the perpendicular diagonals condition. So, this is the same condition. So, the condition that AB = BC leads to px + qy = 0, which is the same condition as the diagonals being perpendicular. So, that's consistent.

So, the key conditions are that points A and B lie on the hyperbola, and that px + qy = 0.

So, now, let's think about this. I have two points A(x, y) and B(p, q) on the hyperbola, with px + qy = 0.

So, perhaps I can express p and q in terms of x and y.

Wait, but both A and B are on the hyperbola, so they satisfy x²/20 - y²/24 = 1 and p²/20 - q²/24 = 1.

Also, from the condition px + qy = 0, I can write p = (-q y)/x, assuming x ≠ 0.

So, if I substitute p into the hyperbola equation for point B:

p²/20 - q²/24 = 1.

Substituting p = (-q y)/x:

[ ( (-q y)/x )² ] /20 - q²/24 = 1

Simplify:

(q² y²)/(20 x²) - q²/24 = 1

Factor out q²:

q² [ y²/(20 x²) - 1/24 ] = 1

So, q² = 1 / [ y²/(20 x²) - 1/24 ]

Hmm, let's compute the denominator:

y²/(20 x²) - 1/24 = (24 y² - 20 x²)/(20 x² * 24 )

Wait, actually, let me compute it more carefully.

Let me find a common denominator for the two terms:

y²/(20 x²) - 1/24 = (24 y² - 20 x²) / (20 x² * 24 )

Wait, 20 x² and 24 have a common denominator of 20 x² * 24 ?

Wait, actually, no. The denominators are 20 x² and 24, so the common denominator is (20 x²)(24). So,

= [24 y² - 20 x² * 1 ] / (20 x² * 24 )

Wait, 20 x² *24 is 480 x².

So,

= (24 y² - 20 x² ) / (480 x² )

So, q² = 1 / [ (24 y² - 20 x² ) / (480 x² ) ] = (480 x² ) / (24 y² - 20 x² )

Hmm, that's getting a bit messy. Maybe we can find another approach.

Alternatively, perhaps I can parameterize point A as (2√5 sec θ, 2√6 tan θ), as I thought earlier. Then, point B can be expressed as (2√5 sec φ, 2√6 tan φ). But perhaps with some relation between θ and φ.

Given that, and the condition px + qy = 0, which in terms of θ and φ would be (2√5 sec φ)(2√5 sec θ) + (2√6 tan φ)(2√6 tan θ) = 0.

Wait, no, p is the x-coordinate of B, which is 2√5 sec φ, and q is the y-coordinate, which is 2√6 tan φ. Similarly, x is 2√5 sec θ, and y is 2√6 tan θ.

So, the condition px + qy = 0 becomes:

(2√5 sec φ)(2√5 sec θ) + (2√6 tan φ)(2√6 tan θ) = 0

Let me compute that:

(2√5)(2√5) sec φ sec θ + (2√6)(2√6) tan φ tan θ = 0

Compute the coefficients:

(2√5)^2 = 4*5 = 20

(2√6)^2 = 4*6 = 24

So,

20 sec φ sec θ + 24 tan φ tan θ = 0

Divide both sides by 4:

5 sec φ sec θ + 6 tan φ tan θ = 0

Hmm, let's write this as:

5 sec φ sec θ = -6 tan φ tan θ

Recall that sec θ = 1 / cos θ, tan θ = sin θ / cos θ.

So, let me rewrite the equation:

5 * (1 / cos φ) * (1 / cos θ) = -6 * (sin φ / cos φ) * (sin θ / cos θ)

Simplify:

5 / (cos φ cos θ) = -6 (sin φ sin θ) / (cos φ cos θ)

Multiply both sides by cos φ cos θ:

5 = -6 sin φ sin θ

So,

sin φ sin θ = -5/6

Interesting. So, the product of sines is -5/6.

Hmm, okay, so that's a relation between θ and φ.

Now, perhaps I can express BD² in terms of these parameters.

BD is the distance between points B and D. But wait, D is the opposite point of B, so D is (-p, -q). So, the distance BD is between (p, q) and (-p, -q).

Wait, actually, BD is the distance between B and D. So, from (p, q) to (-p, -q). So, the distance is sqrt[ (p - (-p))² + (q - (-q))² ] = sqrt[ (2p)^2 + (2q)^2 ] = 2 sqrt(p² + q²)

So, BD² is (2 sqrt(p² + q²))² = 4(p² + q²)

So, BD² = 4(p² + q²)

But p² + q² is (2√5 sec φ)^2 + (2√6 tan φ)^2

Let me compute that:

(2√5 sec φ)^2 = 4*5 sec² φ = 20 sec² φ

(2√6 tan φ)^2 = 4*6 tan² φ = 24 tan² φ

So, p² + q² = 20 sec² φ + 24 tan² φ

So, BD² = 4*(20 sec² φ + 24 tan² φ )

Simplify:

BD² = 80 sec² φ + 96 tan² φ

Hmm, okay, so I need to find the maximum lower bound for BD². So, I need to find the infimum of BD² over all possible φ, given the condition that sin φ sin θ = -5/6, and points A and B are on the hyperbola.

Wait, but in my parametrization, I have point A as (2√5 sec θ, 2√6 tan θ) and point B as (2√5 sec φ, 2√6 tan φ), with the condition that sin φ sin θ = -5/6.

So, maybe I can express θ in terms of φ or vice versa, using that condition, and then express BD² in terms of a single variable.

Let me think. From sin φ sin θ = -5/6, I can write sin θ = (-5)/(6 sin φ )

But θ is an angle such that point A is on the hyperbola, so θ can range where sec θ is defined, i.e., θ ≠ π/2 + kπ.

Similarly, for φ.

But perhaps I can express cos θ in terms of φ, or express tan θ in terms of φ.

Alternatively, perhaps I can relate tan θ and tan φ.

Let me note that:

We have sin θ = (-5)/(6 sin φ )

But from the identity sin² θ + cos² θ = 1, we can write cos θ in terms of sin θ.

But maybe it's better to express tan θ.

tan θ = sin θ / cos θ.

So, let's see, if I have sin θ = (-5)/(6 sin φ ), and I can express cos θ in terms of sin θ.

Wait, cos θ = sqrt(1 - sin² θ) = sqrt(1 - (25)/(36 sin² φ )).

But the sign of cos θ depends on θ. Hmm, but perhaps it's getting complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps I can express tan θ in terms of tan φ.

Wait, let me see.

From the condition:

sin φ sin θ = -5/6

Let me write this as:

sin θ = (-5)/(6 sin φ )

But tan θ = sin θ / cos θ.

So, if I can express cos θ in terms of sin φ, maybe I can relate tan θ and tan φ.

Alternatively, let me use the identity:

tan θ = sin θ / sqrt(1 - sin² θ) = [ (-5)/(6 sin φ ) ] / sqrt(1 - (25)/(36 sin² φ )).

But this seems messy.

Alternatively, perhaps we can express tan θ in terms of tan φ.

Let me think:

Express sin θ in terms of sin φ, then express cos θ in terms of sin phi, then tan theta is sin theta / cos theta.

So, sin theta = (-5)/(6 sin phi )

cos theta = sqrt(1 - sin^2 theta ) = sqrt(1 - 25/(36 sin^2 phi )) = sqrt( (36 sin^2 phi - 25 ) / (36 sin^2 phi ) ) = sqrt(36 sin^2 phi - 25 ) / (6 |sin phi| )

Since sin phi is in the denominator, we have to consider the sign, but maybe for simplicity, let's assume sin phi is positive, and later check if that's valid.

So, assuming sin phi > 0,

cos theta = sqrt(36 sin^2 phi -25 ) / (6 sin phi )

Then, tan theta = sin theta / cos theta = [ (-5)/(6 sin phi ) ] / [ sqrt(36 sin^2 phi -25 ) / (6 sin phi ) ] = (-5)/sqrt(36 sin^2 phi -25 )

So, tan theta = -5 / sqrt(36 sin^2 phi -25 )

Hmm, okay.

But point A is (2√5 sec theta, 2√6 tan theta )

So, let's write the coordinates of A:

x = 2√5 sec theta = 2√5 / cos theta

y = 2√6 tan theta = 2√6 * [ -5 / sqrt(36 sin^2 phi -25 ) ]

But from the condition, we have point A on the hyperbola, so x²/20 - y²/24 =1

Wait, but since point A is already on the hyperbola, it's automatically satisfied. So, maybe we don't need to worry about that.

But perhaps we can relate theta and phi via the condition.

Alternatively, maybe I can proceed to express BD² in terms of phi.

We have BD² = 80 sec² phi + 96 tan² phi

Expressed in terms of phi.

But let's see if we can write this in terms of sin phi.

We know that sec phi = 1 / cos phi, tan phi = sin phi / cos phi.

So, let me write BD² as:

80 sec² phi + 96 tan² phi = 80 / cos² phi + 96 (sin² phi / cos² phi ) = (80 + 96 sin² phi ) / cos² phi

But 1 / cos² phi = 1 + tan² phi, but maybe not helpful here.

Alternatively, express in terms of sin phi.

Let me denote s = sin phi, so cos² phi = 1 - s².

So, BD² = (80 + 96 s² ) / (1 - s² )

Hmm, okay.

So, BD² = (80 + 96 s² ) / (1 - s² )

I can write this as:

BD² = [80 + 96 s² ] / (1 - s² ) = [ 80(1 - s² ) + 80 s² + 96 s² ] / (1 - s² )

Wait, that might not help. Alternatively, let me write 80 + 96 s² = 80 (1) + 16*6 s².

Wait, perhaps factor numerator:

BD² = 16*(5 + 6 s² ) / (1 - s² )

Hmm, since 80 = 16*5 and 96 = 16*6.

So, BD² = 16(5 + 6 s²)/(1 - s² )

So, BD² = 16*(5 +6 s²)/(1 - s² )

I need to find the infimum of BD², which is the greatest lower bound for BD² over all permissible s.

But what are the permissible values of s?

s is sin phi, but we have the condition sin theta sin phi = -5/6.

Earlier, we expressed sin theta = (-5)/(6 sin phi )

But sin theta must satisfy |sin theta| <=1, so | (-5)/(6 sin phi ) | <=1 => |5/(6 sin phi)| <=1 => |5| <= |6 sin phi| => |sin phi| >= 5/6.

So, |sin phi| >=5/6.

Therefore, s = sin phi must satisfy |s| >=5/6.

So, s ∈ [ -1, -5/6 ] ∪ [5/6, 1 ]

So, s is in the regions where sin phi is at least 5/6 in absolute value.

So, s can be between 5/6 and 1, or between -1 and -5/6.

But since BD² is expressed in terms of s squared, which is s², which is same for s and -s, so BD² is even function in s. So, I can consider s ∈ [5/6, 1 ] only.

So, we can let s ∈ [5/6, 1], and express BD² as:

BD² = 16*(5 +6 s²)/(1 - s² )

I need to find the infimum of BD² over s ∈ [5/6, 1]. So, I need to find the minimum value of BD² in this interval, because the infimum would be the minimum if the function is continuous and defined on a closed interval.

So, let me define f(s) = (5 +6 s²)/(1 - s² )

We need to find the minimum of f(s) over s ∈ [5/6,1].

Then, BD² =16 f(s), so the minimum of BD² is 16 times the minimum of f(s).

So, let me find f(s) = (5 +6 s²)/(1 - s² )

First, let's find the derivative of f(s) with respect to s to find critical points.

f(s) = (5 +6 s²)/(1 - s² )

Use the quotient rule:

f’(s) = [ (12 s)(1 - s² ) - (5 +6 s²)(-2 s ) ] / (1 - s² )²

Simplify numerator:

12 s (1 - s² ) + 2 s (5 +6 s² )

Factor 2 s:

2 s [6(1 - s² ) + (5 +6 s² ) ]

Compute inside the brackets:

6 -6 s² +5 +6 s² = 6 +5 + (-6 s² +6 s² ) =11 +0=11

So, numerator is 2 s *11=22 s

Thus, f’(s)=22 s / (1 - s² )²

Set derivative equal to zero: 22 s =0 => s=0

But s ∈ [5/6,1], so s=0 is not in this interval. Therefore, the function f(s) is increasing or decreasing on [5/6,1].

Let me check the sign of f’(s) on [5/6,1]. Since s>0 in [5/6,1], and denominator is squared, positive. So, f’(s)=22 s / positive = positive. So, f(s) is increasing on [5/6,1].

Therefore, the minimum of f(s) occurs at s=5/6.

So, the minimum of f(s) is f(5/6).

Compute f(5/6):

f(5/6)= [5 +6*(25/36) ] / [1 -25/36 ]

Compute numerator:

5 +6*(25/36) =5 + (150/36)=5 + (25/6)= (30/6 +25/6 )=55/6

Denominator:

1 -25/36=11/36

So, f(5/6)= (55/6 ) / (11/36 )= (55/6 )*(36/11 )= (55*6)/11= (5*6)=30

So, f(s) is minimized at s=5/6, f(5/6)=30.

Thus, the minimum BD²=16 *30=480.

Wait, but the problem asks for the greatest real number less than BD² for all such rhombi. So, the infimum is 480, but is 480 attainable?

Wait, let's check when s=5/6, whether such a rhombus exists.

At s=5/6, sin phi=5/6. Then, sin theta= (-5)/(6 sin phi )= (-5)/(6*(5/6))= (-5)/5= -1.

So, sin theta= -1, which implies theta= -π/2.

But theta= -π/2 corresponds to point A being (2√5 sec theta, 2√6 tan theta )

But sec theta at theta= -π/2 is undefined, because cos(-π/2)=0. So, theta cannot be -π/2 because sec theta would be undefined. That's an issue.

Hmm, so s=5/6 leads to theta where point A is not on the hyperbola. So, s=5/6 is not attainable because it would require theta=-π/2, which is not allowed on the hyperbola parametrization.

Therefore, s cannot be exactly 5/6 because that would cause point A to be at infinity.

So, in reality, s must be greater than 5/6 but less than 1.

Wait, that complicates things. So, the minimum of f(s) occurs as s approaches 5/6 from above, making f(s) approach 30, so BD² approaches 480.

But since s can't be exactly 5/6, BD² can't be exactly 480, but can get arbitrarily close to it.

Therefore, the infimum of BD² is 480, but it's not attained. So, the greatest real number less than BD² for all such rhombi would be 480.

Wait, but the wording says "the greatest real number that is less than BD² for all such rhombi." So, the infimum is 480, so any number less than 480 would not be the greatest. Hmm, perhaps I misunderstood.

Wait, actually, the problem asks for the greatest real number that is less than BD² for all such rhombi. So, that is, the supremum of all lower bounds of BD². Since BD² can be as close to 480 as desired but never less than 480, the infimum is 480. So, the greatest lower bound. So, any number less than 480 is not the greatest; the greatest is 480 itself.

But since BD² never actually reaches 480, but approaches it, then 480 is the infimum.

But the question says "the greatest real number that is less than BD² for all such rhombi." So, perhaps it's the supremum of lower bounds. But if the infimum is 480, then the greatest lower bound is 480. So, 480 is the greatest number that is less than or equal to all BD². But the problem says "less than BD² for all such rhombi." So, we need a number M such that M < BD² for all rhombi, and M is the greatest such number.

So, since BD² can be made arbitrarily close to 480 from above, the greatest such M is 480.

Because for any M' <480, there exists a rhombus with BD² < M' is not possible because BD² can be as close to 480 as needed. Wait, no, actually, if BD² approaches 480 from above, then for any M <480, there exists a rhombus with BD² just above 480, which is greater than M. So, M must be <=480.

But the question is, what is the greatest M such that M < BD² for all rhombi.

So, since BD² can be made as close to 480 as we want, for any M <480, there exists a rhombus with BD² approaching 480 from above, which is greater than M. So, 480 is the infimum. So, the greatest M is 480, because for all rhombi, BD² >=480, so 480 is less than or equal to all BD². But the question says "less than BD² for all such rhombi." So, if 480 is the infimum, then for all rhombi, BD² >=480. So, 480 is the greatest number such that 480 <= BD² for all rhombi. But the question asks for the greatest real number less than BD² for all such rhombi.

Wait, perhaps it's 480, but since BD² is always greater than 480, then 480 is the greatest lower bound, but it's not actually attained, so the number we're looking for is 480.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in interpreting the parametrization.

Wait, let me check when s approaches 5/6 from above, what happens to point A.

As s approaches 5/6+, sin phi approaches 5/6 from above, so phi approaches arcsin(5/6).

Then, sin theta = (-5)/(6 sin phi ) approaches (-5)/(6*(5/6)) = -1.

So, theta approaches -π/2, but point A is approaching the point where sec theta approaches infinity, so point A approaches infinity on the hyperbola.

Similarly, when point A is at infinity, BD² approaches 480.

So, BD² is always greater than 480, but can get as close as desired to 480.

So, the infimum is 480. So, the greatest number less than BD² for all rhombi is 480, because for any M <480, there exists a rhombus with BD² as close to 480 as needed, which would be greater than M. But since 480 itself is not attained, it's the infimum.

Wait, but the question is asking for the greatest real number that is less than BD² for all such rhombi. So, that would be the infimum, which is 480.

But the problem says "the greatest real number that is less than BD² for all such rhombi," which is essentially the infimum. So, the answer is 480.

Therefore, I think the answer is 480.


To solve the problem, we analyze the given hyperbola and the properties of the rhombus. The hyperbola is given by \( \frac{x^2}{20} - \frac{y^2}{24} = 1 \), and the rhombus \(ABCD\) has its diagonals intersecting at the origin. The diagonals of a rhombus bisect each other at right angles, and their midpoints coincide.

### Key Steps:
1. **Parametrization of the Hyperbola**: Points \(A\) and \(B\) on the hyperbola can be parametrized as \(A(2\sqrt{5} \sec \theta, 2\sqrt{6} \tan \theta)\) and \(B(2\sqrt{5} \sec \phi, 2\sqrt{6} \tan \phi)\).

2. **Condition for Perpendicular Diagonals**: The diagonals \(AC\) and \(BD\) are perpendicular, leading to the condition \(xp + yq = 0\), where \(A(x, y)\) and \(B(p, q)\).

3. **Expression for \(BD^2\)**: The length of diagonal \(BD\) is derived as \(BD^2 = 4(p^2 + q^2)\). Substituting the coordinates of \(B\), we get:
   \[
   BD^2 = 80 \sec^2 \phi + 96 \tan^2 \phi
   \]

4. **Simplifying \(BD^2\)**: Using trigonometric identities and expressing in terms of \(s = \sin \phi\), we find:
   \[
   BD^2 = \frac{16(5 + 6s^2)}{1 - s^2}
   \]
   where \(|s| \geq \frac{5}{6}\).

5. **Finding the Infimum**: The function \(BD^2\) is minimized when \(s = \frac{5}{6}\), leading to:
   \[
   BD^2 \to 480 \quad \text{as} \quad s \to \frac{5}{6}^+
   \]
   However, since \(s = \frac{5}{6}\) corresponds to a point at infinity, \(BD^2\) approaches 480 but never actually reaches it.

6. **Conclusion**: The greatest real number less than \(BD^2\) for all such rhombi is the infimum of \(BD^2\), which is 480.

### Final Answer:
\[
\boxed{480}
\]
