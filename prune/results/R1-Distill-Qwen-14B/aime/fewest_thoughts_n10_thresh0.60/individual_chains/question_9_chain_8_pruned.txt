Okay, so I have this logarithm problem here. It says that there are real numbers x and y, both greater than 1, such that log base x of y^x equals 10, and log base y of x^(4y) also equals 10. I need to find the product xy. Hmm, let me try to break this down.

First, I remember that logarithms can be tricky, but there are some properties that might help here. Let me write down the given equations:

1. log_x(y^x) = 10
2. log_y(x^{4y}) = 10

I think I can use the power rule for logarithms, which says that log_b(a^k) = k * log_b(a). Applying that to both equations might simplify things.

Starting with the first equation:
log_x(y^x) = x * log_x(y) = 10.

Similarly, the second equation:
log_y(x^{4y}) = 4y * log_y(x) = 10.

So now I have:
1. x * log_x(y) = 10
2. 4y * log_y(x) = 10

Hmm, okay. I notice that log_x(y) and log_y(x) are reciprocals of each other. Because log_b(a) = 1 / log_a(b). Let me confirm that: if log_x(y) = k, then x^k = y, which means y^(1/k) = x, so log_y(x) = 1/k. Yeah, that's right. So log_x(y) = 1 / log_y(x).

Let me letâ€™s denote log_x(y) as t. Then log_y(x) = 1/t.

So substituting into the first equation:

x * t = 10. (1)

And the second equation becomes:

4y * (1/t) = 10. (2)

So now I have two equations:

1. x * t = 10
2. 4y / t = 10

I can solve equation 1 for x: x = 10 / t.

And equation 2 for y: 4y = 10t => y = (10t)/4 = (5t)/2.

So now I have x and y in terms of t. Maybe I can find a relationship between x and y using the fact that t = log_x(y).

Wait, t is log_x(y), which is the same as log(y)/log(x). So t = log(y)/log(x).

But x and y are expressed in terms of t now. Let me write that down.

t = log(y) / log(x) 

But x = 10/t, so log(x) = log(10/t). Similarly, y = (5t)/2, so log(y) = log(5t/2).

So substituting back into t:

t = [log(5t/2)] / [log(10/t)]

Hmm, this looks a bit complicated. Maybe I can define u = t, and write this as:

t = [log(5t/2)] / [log(10/t)]

But solving this equation for t might not be straightforward. Maybe I can cross-multiply to get rid of the denominator:

t * log(10/t) = log(5t/2)

Hmm, maybe I can express log(10/t) as log(10) - log(t), and log(5t/2) as log(5) + log(t) - log(2). Wait, no, actually, log(ab) is log(a) + log(b), so log(5t/2) is log(5) + log(t) - log(2). Is that right? Let me see: 5t/2 = (5/2) * t, so log(5t/2) = log(5/2) + log(t).

Similarly, log(10/t) = log(10) - log(t) = 1 - log(t) since log(10) is 1 if we're using base 10. Wait, but wait, in this problem, the logarithms are in different bases; the first was base x, the second base y. Hmm, but when I wrote t = log_x(y), that's log base x of y, which is equal to ln(y)/ln
