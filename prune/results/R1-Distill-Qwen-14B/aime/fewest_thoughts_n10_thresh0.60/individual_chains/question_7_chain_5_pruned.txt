Okay, so I have this problem about a regular octagon where each vertex is colored either red or blue, each with a 50% chance. The question is about finding the probability that there's a rotation which turns all the blue vertices into positions that were originally red. The answer needs to be in the form m/n where m and n are coprime, and then find m + n.

Hmm, let me try to digest this. So, each vertex is colored red or blue independently with equal probability. That means for each vertex, the color is like a coin flip—50% red, 50% blue. So, the total number of possible colorings is 2^8 = 256, since there are 8 vertices.

Now, the problem is asking about the probability that the octagon can be rotated such that all the blue vertices end up where there were originally red vertices. Let me try to rephrase that: after some rotation, every blue vertex moves to a position that was red before the rotation. So, in other words, the set of blue vertices must be a rotation of the set of red vertices. Because when you rotate the octagon, each blue vertex moves to a new position, and we need all those new positions to have been red originally.

Wait, so another way to put it is that the set of blue vertices must be a rotation of the set of red vertices. So, the blue and red sets are rotations of each other. That makes sense because if you can rotate the blue set to match the red set, then rotating the octagon accordingly would map all blue vertices to red ones.

So, the problem reduces to counting the number of colorings where the blue set is a rotation of the red set. Then, the probability would be that number divided by 256.

But how do I count such colorings?

Let me think about the symmetries of the octagon. A regular octagon has rotational symmetry of order 8, meaning it can be rotated by 0°, 45°, 90°, ..., up to 315°, which correspond to rotations by 0, 1, 2, ..., 7 steps (since each step is 45°). So, for each rotation, I need to check if the blue set is a rotation of the red set.

Wait, but the problem is about the existence of at least one such rotation. So, we're looking for colorings where there exists some rotation that maps the blue set to the red set.

Hmm, but how does that work? Because for each coloring, we can rotate it and see if the blue set maps to the red set.

Alternatively, perhaps the condition is equivalent to the blue set being a rotationally shifted version of the red set. So, the red and blue sets must form a partition of the octagon's vertices into two rotationally congruent sets.

Wait, but in a regular octagon, the only way two subsets are rotations of each other is if they are both unions of entire orbits under the rotation action. Or perhaps, more specifically, each subset must be a union of certain rotationally symmetric patterns.

Alternatively, maybe the blue and red sets must be such that they are each other's images under some rotation. So, for a given coloring, if there exists a rotation that maps blue to red, then it's counted.

So, perhaps it's easier to model
