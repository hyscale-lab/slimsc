Okay, so I've got this math problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's try to understand it thoroughly.

The problem says: There's a list of positive integers with three properties.

1. The sum of all the items is 30.
2. The unique mode is 9.
3. The median is a positive integer that doesn't appear in the list.

And the question is asking for the sum of the squares of all the items in the list.

Hmm, okay, so I need to find such a list and then compute the sum of the squares.

Let me break down each condition and see what they imply.

First, the sum is 30. So if I have n numbers, their total is 30. Since they're positive integers, each is at least 1.

Second, the unique mode is 9. So 9 appears more frequently than any other number. Also, no other number shares this highest frequency. So 9 must occur at least twice, and more than any other number.

Third, the median is a positive integer that doesn't appear in the list. The median being a positive integer suggests that the list has an odd number of elements because the median is the middle number in an ordered list. If it were even, the median would be the average of two numbers, which might not be an integer. Wait, noâ€”if the average of two integers is an integer, then those two integers must be the same or both even. But in this case, the median is a positive integer that doesn't appear in the list. So, if the list has an odd number of elements, say 2k+1, then the median is the (k+1)th term. Since it's an integer and doesn't appear in the list, that means in the ordered list, the (k+1)th term is some integer m not present in the list. But wait, that can't be because the list is ordered, right? Wait, no. Wait, if the median is m, then in the ordered list, the middle element is m. But the problem says it doesn't appear in the list, which would mean that m isn't in the list. But if the middle element is m, then m is in the list. That seems contradictory. Hmm, maybe I'm misunderstanding something.

Wait, perhaps the list has an even number of elements. Let me think again. If the list has an even number of elements, say 2k, then the median is the average of the kth and (k+1)th terms. For the median to be an integer, the average must be an integer, so the two middle numbers must add up to an even number. Also, the median is a positive integer not present in the list itself
