Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the remainder when the product from k=0 to 12 of (2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k}) is divided by 1000. ω is a 13th root of unity, and it's not equal to 1. Hmm, okay. Let me try to break this down.

First, I remember that roots of unity have some nice properties. Since ω is a primitive 13th root of unity (because ω ≠ 1), it satisfies ω^13 = 1, and ω^k for k from 0 to 12 gives all the distinct 13th roots of unity. That might come in handy.

The expression inside the product is (2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k}). I need to compute the product over all k from 0 to 12. So, that's a product of 13 terms. Maybe I can find a pattern or relate this to some polynomial whose roots are these terms.

Wait, let's see. Let me denote each term as f(ω^k) where f(x) = 2 - 2x + x^2. So, f(x) = x² - 2x + 2. Hmm, that's a quadratic. Maybe I can factor this or relate it to minimal polynomials over the field.

Alternatively, perhaps I can consider the product over all k of f(ω^k). Since ω^k runs through all 13th roots of unity except 1 (wait, no, k=0 gives ω^0=1 as well). So, actually, the product includes k=0, which gives f(1) as one term.

Wait, let me compute f(1). f(1) = 2 - 2*1 + 1^2 = 2 - 2 + 1 = 1. So, the first term when k=0 is 1. That might be a useful observation.

So, the product is equal to 1 multiplied by the product from k=1 to 12 of (2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k}). So, the problem reduces to finding the product from k=1 to 12 of (2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k}).

Now, I need to compute the product of (2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k}) for k=1 to 12. Let me try to express this product in terms of polynomials.

Since ω^k are roots of the cyclotomic polynomial Φ_13(x), which is x^12 + x^11 + ... + x + 1. But I'm not sure if that's directly applicable here.

Alternatively, perhaps I can consider that for each k, f(ω^k) = 2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k} = ω^{2k} - 2ω^k + 2. Wait, that's a quadratic in ω^k. Maybe I can factor this quadratic or relate it to another polynomial.

Let me consider f(x) = x² - 2x + 2. Its roots can be found using the quadratic formula: x = [2 ± sqrt(4 - 8)] / 2 = [2 ± sqrt(-4)] / 2 = 1 ± i. So, f(x) factors as (x - (1 + i))(x - (1 - i)).

So, f(x) = (x - (1 + i))(x - (1 - i)). Therefore, f(ω^k) = (ω^k - (1 + i))(ω^k - (1 - i)). 

So, the product from k=1 to 12 of f(ω^k) is equal to the product from k=1 to 12 of (ω^k - (1 + i))(ω^k - (1 - i)).

Which can be written as [product from k=
