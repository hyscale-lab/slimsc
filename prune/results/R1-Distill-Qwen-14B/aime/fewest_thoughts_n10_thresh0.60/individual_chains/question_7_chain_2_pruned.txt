Okay, so I've got this problem about a regular octagon where each vertex is colored either red or blue, each with a 50% chance. The question is about finding the probability that after coloring, we can rotate the octagon such that all the blue vertices end up where red vertices were originally. The answer needs to be expressed as a reduced fraction m/n and then find m + n.

Hmm, let me unpack this. So, we're dealing with a regular octagon, which has 8 vertices. Each vertex is independently colored red or blue, each color having a 1/2 chance. So, the total number of possible colorings is 2^8, which is 256. That might come into play later.

The key part here is that we need to find colorings where there exists some rotation of the octagon such that every blue vertex moves to a position that was previously red. So, if I imagine the octagon before rotation, each blue vertex must be mapped via rotation to a red vertex in the original configuration.

Wait, so the rotation must map blues to reds. That implies that the set of blue vertices must be a rotated version of the set of red vertices. Because if you rotate the octagon, the blue positions after rotation would have to exactly coincide with the red positions before rotation.

Wait, but since it's a regular octagon, any rotation is a symmetry of the octagon. So, the idea is that the set of blue vertices must be a translate (rotational shift) of the set of red vertices. Alternatively, the set of blue vertices is a rotation of the red vertices.

But since the octagon is regular, the group of rotations is cyclic of order 8. So, perhaps we can model this problem using group theory or combinatorics.

Let me think. For a given coloring, let B be the set of blue vertices and R be the set of red vertices. Then, we want that B is equal to R shifted by some rotation. So, there exists a rotation σ such that σ(B) = R.

But since R is the complement of B, because each vertex is either red or blue, R = V \ B, where V is the set of all vertices. So, σ(B) = V \ B.

Therefore, σ(B) must be the complement of B. So, this is equivalent to saying that σ(B) = V \ B. Which implies that σ is an involution on B, meaning that applying σ twice would
