Okay, so I have this problem about a lottery that Jen is entering. Let me try to understand what's being asked here. 

Jen picks 4 distinct numbers from the set S, which is {1,2,3,...,9,10}. So, there are 10 numbers in total, and she selects 4 without repetition. Then, 4 numbers are randomly chosen from S as well. 

The problem mentions two winning conditions: she wins a prize if at least two of her numbers are among the randomly chosen four, and she wins the grand prize if all four of her numbers are chosen. 

The question is about probability: we need to find the probability that Jen wins the grand prize given that she won a prize. This is a conditional probability problem. 

So, the formula for conditional probability is P(A|B) = P(A ∩ B) / P(B). In this case, event A is winning the grand prize, which is a subset of winning a prize (event B). So, P(A ∩ B) is just P(A), since winning the grand prize implies she has won a prize. Therefore, the probability we need is P(A)/P(B).

So, let me break this down into steps:

1. Calculate the total number of ways to choose 4 numbers from 10. That will be the denominator for all probabilities because the total possible outcomes are combinations of 10 numbers taken 4 at a time.

2. Compute the number of favorable outcomes for event A (winning the grand prize). This is straightforward because Jen has to pick exactly the 4 numbers that are chosen, so there's only 1 way this can happen for her specific set of 4 numbers.

3. Compute the number of favorable outcomes for event B (winning a prize). Winning a prize means at least two of her numbers are chosen. So, this includes scenarios where exactly 2, exactly 3, or exactly 4 of her numbers are among the chosen four. 

Wait, but since the grand prize is when all four are chosen, that's included in event B. So, to find P(B), I need to calculate the number of ways where at least two of Jen's numbers are selected.

Let me structure this:

Total possible combinations: C(10,4). 

Number of ways for grand prize: C(4,4) * C(6,0) because Jen's 4 specific numbers are chosen, and the remaining 0 are from the other 6 numbers. Wait, no. Wait, actually, the grand prize is just one specific combination where all four of her numbers are chosen. So, the number of favorable outcomes for A is 1.

But wait, no. Wait, actually, the total number of possible 4-number combinations is C(10,4). The number of ways that all four of Jen's numbers are chosen is 1 (since she has a specific set of 4 numbers). So, P(A) is 1 / C(10,4).

Now, for event B, which is winning a prize, she needs at least two numbers matching. So, the number of favorable outcomes is the sum of the number of ways to choose exactly 2, exactly 3, and exactly 4 of her numbers.

Let me denote:

- C(4, k) * C(6, 4 - k) for k = 2,3,4.

Wait, because she has 4 numbers, and the other 6 numbers are not hers. So, for exactly k of her numbers being chosen, we choose k from her 4 and 4 - k from the remaining 6.

So, the total number of favorable outcomes for B is:

C(4,2)*C(6,2) + C(4,3)*C(6,1) + C(4,4)*C(6,0)

Let me compute each term:

C(4,2) * C(6,2) = 6 * 15 = 90

C(4,3)*C(6,1) = 4 * 6 = 24

C(4,4)*C(6,0) = 1 * 1 = 1

Adding them up: 90 + 24 + 1 = 115.

So, the number of favorable outcomes for event B is 115.

But wait, let me double-check that. So, when you have 4 numbers chosen, and you want exactly k of them to be Jen's numbers. So, for k=2, it's C(4,2) * C(6,2), since you choose 2 from her 4 and 2 from the other 6. Similarly for k=3 and k=4.

So, the sum is 90 + 24 + 1 = 115, as I had before.

Therefore, the number of favorable outcomes for B is 115, and the total possible combinations are C(10,4) = 210.

So, P(B) = 115 / 210.

Similarly, P(A) is 1 / 210.

Therefore, the conditional probability P(A|B) is (1 / 210) / (115 / 210) = 1 / 115.

Wait, that seems too straightforward. So, the probability is 1/115. Are m and n 1 and 115, which are coprime, so m + n = 116.

But let me think again. Is that correct? Because sometimes when dealing with conditional probabilities, especially with combinatorial problems, it's easy to make a mistake. Let me verify the calculations.

Total number of possible 4-number combinations: C(10,4) = 210. That's correct.

Number of ways for exactly k matches (k=2,3,4):

For k=2: C(4,2)*C(6,2) = 6 * 15 = 90.

For k=3: C(4,3)*C(6,1) = 4 * 6 =24.

For k=4: C(4,4)*C(6,0)=1*1=1.

Total: 90 +24 +1=115.

So, P(B) = 115 / 210.

P(A) is 1 / 210.

Thus, P(A|B) = (1/210) / (115/210) = 1/115.

Wait, but 1 and 115 are coprime, so m=1, n=115, m +n=116.

Hmm, that seems correct, but I want to make sure I didn't miss anything in the problem statement.

Wait, the problem says that 4 numbers are randomly chosen from S. So, that's correct. The way I computed the number of possible combinations is correct.

Alternatively, sometimes conditional probability can be approached by thinking about the problem differently, like counting the number of favorable cases given that the condition is met.

In this case, given that she has won a prize (i.e., at least two numbers match), what's the probability that all four match.

So, the conditional probability is (number of grand prize outcomes) / (number of prize outcomes). Which is 1 / 115, as I found earlier.

Wait, but let me think about another approach. Suppose I fix Jen's 4 numbers, say numbers 1,2,3,4 for simplicity.

Then, the total number of possible winning combinations is all the 4-number combinations that include at least two of 1,2,3,4.

So, the total number is C(4,2)*C(6,2) + C(4,3)*C(6,1) + C(4,4)*C(6,0) = 90 +24 +1=115, which is the same as before.

So, the number of favorable outcomes for B is 115.

Out of these, the number of favorable outcomes for A is 1.

Thus, the conditional probability is 1/115.

Yes, so that seems correct.

Wait, but I just thought about another way: hypergeometric distribution. Maybe that could help.

In the hypergeometric distribution, the probability of k successes (in this case, matching numbers) in n draws (here, 4 numbers) without replacement from a finite population (10 numbers) containing a specific number of successes (4 numbers that Jen picked).

So, the probability of at least two successes is 1 minus the probability of 0 or 1 success.

But in our case, we're not calculating probability, but rather, conditional probability.

Wait, perhaps thinking in terms of hypergeometric is complicating it. Since we already went through the combinatorial approach and got a consistent answer.

So, the probability is 1/115, so m + n is 1 + 115 = 116.

I think that's correct.


To solve the problem, we need to find the probability that Jen wins the grand prize given that she won a prize. This is a conditional probability problem where we calculate \( P(A|B) \), where \( A \) is winning the grand prize and \( B \) is winning a prize.

1. **Total possible combinations**: The total number of ways to choose 4 numbers from 10 is \( \binom{10}{4} = 210 \).

2. **Number of ways to win the grand prize (event A)**: This occurs if all four of Jen's numbers are chosen. There is only 1 way this can happen, so the number of favorable outcomes for \( A \) is 1.

3. **Number of ways to win a prize (event B)**: This includes scenarios where exactly 2, 3, or 4 of Jen's numbers are chosen. We calculate this as:
   - Exactly 2 numbers: \( \binom{4}{2} \times \binom{6}{2} = 6 \times 15 = 90 \)
   - Exactly 3 numbers: \( \binom{4}{3} \times \binom{6}{1} = 4 \times 6 = 24 \)
   - Exactly 4 numbers: \( \binom{4}{4} \times \binom{6}{0} = 1 \times 1 = 1 \)
   Adding these, the total number of favorable outcomes for \( B \) is \( 90 + 24 + 1 = 115 \).

4. **Probability calculations**:
   - \( P(B) = \frac{115}{210} \)
   - \( P(A) = \frac{1}{210} \)

5. **Conditional probability**:
   \[
   P(A|B) = \frac{P(A)}{P(B)} = \frac{\frac{1}{210}}{\frac{115}{210}} = \frac{1}{115}
   \]

The probability of winning the grand prize given that she won a prize is \( \frac{1}{115} \). Since 1 and 115 are coprime, \( m = 1 \) and \( n = 115 \). Therefore, \( m + n = 1 + 115 = 116 \).

\boxed{116}
