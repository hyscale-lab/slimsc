Okay, so I have this problem to solve. It's about finding the least integer base b (where b is at least 2) such that there are more than ten b-eautiful integers. Let me try to understand the problem step by step.

First, the definition: a positive integer n is called b-eautiful if two conditions are met. One, when n is expressed in base b, it has exactly two digits. Two, the sum of these two digits equals the square root of n. 

Let me break that down. If n is a two-digit number in base b, then in base 10, it would be something like n = a * b + c, where a and c are the digits in base b. Here, a is the first digit, which can't be zero because it's a two-digit number, and c is the second digit, which can be zero or more. So, a ranges from 1 to b-1, and c ranges from 0 to b-1.

The second condition is that the sum of the digits, a + c, equals the square root of n. So, sqrt(n) = a + c. Squaring both sides, that gives n = (a + c)^2.

But since n is also equal to a * b + c, we can set up the equation: a * b + c = (a + c)^2.

So, putting it all together, for each base b, we need to find all pairs of digits (a, c) such that a is from 1 to b-1, c is from 0 to b-1, and a * b + c = (a + c)^2.

Our goal is to find the smallest b such that the number of such pairs (and hence the number of b-eautiful integers n) is more than ten.

Let me think about how to approach this. For a given b, I can iterate through all possible a and c, check if the equation holds, count the valid (a, c) pairs, and see when that count exceeds 10.

But since I don't want to check each base one by one manually, perhaps there's a smarter way to model this.

Let me rearrange the equation: a * b + c = (a + c)^2.

Let me denote s = a + c. Then the equation becomes a * b + c = s^2.

But s = a + c, so I can substitute c = s - a into the equation. So, a * b + (s - a) = s^2.

Simplify that: a*b + s - a = s^2

Factor out a: a*(b - 1) + s = s^2

Let me rearrange terms:

a*(b - 1) = s^2 - s

So, a = (s^2 - s) / (b - 1)

Since a must be an integer between 1 and b-1, this fraction must simplify to an integer. So, (s^2 - s) must be divisible by (b - 1).

Let me note that s = a + c, and since a is at least 1 and c is at least 0, s is at least 1. But since n is a two-digit number in base b, the maximum value of s is (b-1) + (b-1) = 2b - 2. Wait, but s is the square root of n, so s must be an integer because n has to be a perfect square? Wait, no, wait. Wait, n is a two-digit number in base b, but n is equal to (a + c)^2, so n must be a perfect square in base 10. So, s must be an integer because sqrt(n) is an integer. Therefore, s must be a positive integer such that s^2 is a two-digit number in base b, which also implies that s must satisfy s^2 >= b (since the smallest two-digit number in base b is 10_b, which is b in base 10) and s^2 < b^2 (since the largest two-digit number in base b is (b-1)(b) + (b-1) = b^2 - 1 in base 10).

So, s must be an integer such that sqrt(b) <= s < b.

Wait, let's test that. Let me take an example. The problem statement says 81 is 13-eautiful. So
