Okay, so I have this geometry problem here. Let me try to understand what's going on. We have triangle ABC inscribed in a circle ω. The tangents at points B and C intersect at point D. Then, the line AD intersects ω again at point P. We need to find the length of AP, given that AB is 5, BC is 9, and AC is 10. The answer should be in the form m/n where m and n are coprime, and then find m + n.

Hmm, let's start by drawing a rough sketch in my mind. Triangle ABC with sides AB=5, BC=9, AC=10. So, it's a scalene triangle. The circle ω is the circumcircle of ABC. The tangents at B and C meet at D. That point D is outside the circle since tangents from a common external point are equal. So, DB = DC because they're both tangents from D to ω.

AD intersects ω again at P. So, AP is a secant of the circle, and PD is the external segment. 

I remember that when dealing with tangents and secants, there are some power of a point theorems that might be useful here. Specifically, the power of point D with respect to ω should be equal to DB squared because D is outside the circle and DB is a tangent. Also, the power of D can be expressed as DP * DA because AD is a secant intersecting the circle at A and P.

So, the power of point D gives us:

DB² = DP * DA.

But I don't know DB or DP or DA yet. Maybe I can find some relations using triangle ABC's sides and the properties of the circumcircle.

Wait, triangle ABC has sides 5, 9, 10. Let me compute its circumradius because that might help. The formula for the circumradius R is (a*b*c)/(4*Δ), where Δ is the area.

First, let's compute the area of triangle ABC using Heron's formula. The semi-perimeter s = (5 + 9 + 10)/2 = 24/2 = 12.

Then, the area Δ = √[s(s - a)(s - b)(s - c)] = √[12*(12-5)*(12-9)*(12-10)] = √[12*7*3*2] = √(504) = √(16*31.5) = √(16*9*3.5) = 4*3*√(3.5) = 12√(3.5). Wait, that doesn't seem right. Let me compute it again.

Wait, 12*7 is 84, 84*3 is 252, 252*2 is 504. So, √504. Let's factor 504:

504 = 16 * 31.5. Hmm, no, 504 = 16 * 31.5? Wait, 16 * 31.5 is 504? 16*30 is 480, plus 16*1.5 is 24, so yes, 480 +24=504. So, √504 = √(16*31.5) = 4√31.5. But 31.5 is 63/2, so √31.5 is √(63/2) = (3√14)/√2 = (3√28)/2. Wait, maybe I'm complicating it.

Alternatively, 504 = 7 * 72 = 7 * 9 * 8 = 7 * 9 * 8. So, √504 = √(7*9*8) = 3*2√14 = 6√14. Oh, right! Because 7*8=56, 56*9=504. So, √504 = √(7*8*9) = √(7)*(√8)*(√9) = √7 * 2√2 * 3 = 6√14. So, area Δ = 6√14.

Okay, so the area is 6√14. Now, the circumradius R is (a*b*c)/(4Δ) = (5*9*10)/(4*6√14) = (450)/(24√14) = (75)/(4√14). Hmm, rationalizing the denominator, R = (75√14)/(4*14) = (75√14)/56
