Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the product xy, given that both x and y are real numbers greater than 1. The equations provided are log base x of y^x equals 10, and log base y of x^{4y} also equals 10. Hmm, okay, let's break this down step by step.

First, I remember that logarithms can be tricky, but there are some properties that might help here. The first equation is log_x(y^x) = 10. I recall that log_b(a^n) = n * log_b(a), so maybe I can apply that here.

Wait, yes, so log_x(y^x) should be x * log_x(y) = 10. So, x * log_x(y) = 10. Hmm, but log_x(y) is the same as (ln y) / (ln x), right? Because log_b(a) = ln a / ln b. So maybe I can express this in terms of natural logarithms.

Let me assign variables to make it easier. Let’s let a = ln x and b = ln y. Since x and y are both greater than 1, a and b are positive real numbers.

So, from the first equation: x * (ln y / ln x) = 10. Substituting a and b, that becomes x * (b / a) = 10. But x is e^a because a = ln x. So, e^a * (b / a) = 10. I'll write that as (e^a * b)/a = 10.

Okay, moving on to the second equation: log_y(x^{4y}) = 10. Using the same logarithm property, this becomes 4y * log_y(x) = 10. And log_y(x) is (ln x) / (ln y) which is a / b.

So substituting, we get 4y * (a / b) = 10. Again, y is e^b, so 4 * e^b * (a / b) = 10. Which simplifies to (4 e^b a)/b = 10.

Wait, so now I have two equations:

1. (e^a * b) / a = 10
2. (4 e^b * a) / b = 10

Hmm, this looks a bit complex, but maybe I can relate them. Let me write them again:

Equation 1: (e^a * b) / a = 10 → e^a * b = 10a.

Equation 2: (4 e^b * a) / b = 10 → 4 e^b * a = 10b.

Let me see if I can express one variable in terms of the other. Let's take equation 1 and solve for e^a:

From equation 1: e^a = (10a) / b.

Similarly, from equation 2, solve for e^b:

4 e^b a = 10 b → e^b = (10 b) / (4 a) = (5 b)/(2 a).

So now I have expressions for e^a and e^b in terms of a and b.

But e^a and e^b are related because e^a = x and e^b = y, but maybe I can find a relationship between a and b.

Alternatively, perhaps I can take the two expressions for e^a and e^b
