Okay, so I'm trying to solve this probability problem about coloring the vertices of a regular octagon. Each vertex can be colored either red or blue, each with a 50% chance. The question is asking for the probability that there exists a rotation of the octagon such that all the blue vertices end up where the red ones were originally. Then, they mention that this probability is m/n where m and n are coprime, and I need to find m + n.

Hmm, let me break this down. First, a regular octagon has eight vertices, each connected in a cycle. When we color each vertex red or blue, it's like assigning a binary color to each. The problem is about the probability that, after some rotation, all the blue vertices (which are in some positions) can be mapped to the red vertices originally.

Wait, so actually, it's about the existence of a rotation that permutes the blue vertices to the red positions. So, if after rotation, every blue vertex is on a position that was red before. That sounds a bit like the blue and red colorings being related by a rotation.

Let me think about how rotations work in an octagon. A regular octagon can be rotated by multiples of 45 degrees, right? So, the possible rotations are by 0째, 45째, 90째, ..., 315째, which corresponds to rotating by 0, 1, 2, ..., 7 positions. Each rotation is a cyclic permutation of the vertices.

So, for each coloring, I need to check if there's a rotation that maps the set of blue vertices to the set of red vertices. If such a rotation exists, then that coloring satisfies the condition we're looking for.

Let me think about how to calculate this probability. The total number of colorings is 2^8 = 256, since each vertex is independently colored red or blue. Now, I need to count how many colorings satisfy the condition that there exists a rotation mapping blue vertices to red ones.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to think about the colorings where the set of blue vertices is a rotation of the set of red vertices. But wait, actually, the set of red vertices is the complement of the blue ones, so if the blue set is a rotation of the red set, that implies that the blue set is a rotation of its own complement. So, the blue set must be a rotation of its complement. Hmm, that
