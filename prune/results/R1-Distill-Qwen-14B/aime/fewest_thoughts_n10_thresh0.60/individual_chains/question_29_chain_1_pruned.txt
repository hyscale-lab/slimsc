Okay, so I have this geometry problem here. Let me try to visualize it and understand what's given and what's being asked. 

We have two rectangles, ABCD and EFGH. The points D, E, C, F are collinear. Also, the points A, D, H, G lie on a circle. The lengths given are BC=16, AB=107, FG=17, and EF=184. I need to find the length of CE.

First, let me sketch this out mentally. Rectangles ABCD and EFGH. So, ABCD has sides AB, BC, CD, DA. Similarly, EFGH has sides EF, FG, GH, HE. Since they are rectangles, all angles are right angles.

Given that D, E, C, F are collinear. That means all four points lie on a straight line. So, the order might be D-E-C-F or some other order? Wait, but since ABCD and EFGH are rectangles, their sides are at right angles. Hmm.

Also, A, D, H, G lie on a circle. That's interesting; that means these four points are concyclic or lie on the same circumference. That might imply some cyclic quadrilateral properties. So, maybe we can use the cyclic quadrilateral theorem, which states that the product of the lengths of the diagonals is equal to the sum of the products of opposite sides? Or perhaps it's the power of a point.

Wait, the cyclic quadrilateral theorem says that in a cyclic quadrilateral, the sum of each pair of opposite angles is 180 degrees. But I'm not sure how that helps here directly. Maybe something with similar triangles or power of a point?

Let me note down the given lengths. BC=16. Since ABCD is a rectangle, BC is one side. So, BC=16, which would mean AD=16 as well because in a rectangle, opposite sides are equal. AB is 107, so the other side of the rectangle is 107. So, AB=CD=107, and BC=AD=16.

For rectangle EFGH, FG=17, EF=184. So, EF is 184, which would be one side, FG=17, so EF=GH=184, and FG=EH=17.

Now, points D, E
