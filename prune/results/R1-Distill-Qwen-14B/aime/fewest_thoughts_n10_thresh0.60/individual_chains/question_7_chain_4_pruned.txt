Okay, so I have this problem about a regular octagon where each vertex is colored either red or blue, each with a 50% chance. The question is about finding the probability that we can rotate the octagon such that all the blue vertices end up where the red ones were originally. That probability is given as m/n, and we need to find m + n where m and n are coprime.

Hmm, let's try to break this down. First, I know a regular octagon has 8 sides, so 8 vertices. Each vertex is colored independently, either red or blue with equal probability. So each coloring is a sequence of 8 red and blue colors, each with probability 1/2.

Now, the problem is asking for the probability that there exists a rotation (by some multiple of 45 degrees, since 360/8 = 45) such that when we apply this rotation, all the blue vertices move to positions that were originally red. So, after rotation, the set of blue vertices must coincide with the set of red vertices.

Wait, is that the same as saying that the set of blue vertices is a rotation of the set of red vertices? Because if you rotate the octagon, the red vertices shift positions, and we want the blue ones to align exactly with where the red ones were.

But wait, the octagon is being rotated, so the colors are fixed on the vertices, but the labels (if you think of them as positions) are moving. So, if I rotate the octagon, the colors stay on their original vertices, but their positions relative to the octagon's structure change.

Wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me clarify.

Each vertex is colored either red or blue. Then, we can rotate the entire octagon, and after rotation, we check if all the blue vertices are now in positions that were originally red. So, the set of blue vertices should be a rotation of the set of red vertices.

But actually, the octagon is being rotated, so the color assignments are fixed. If I start with a coloring, and then rotate the octagon, the colors stay fixed on the same physical positions, but from the viewer's perspective, the octagon's orientation has changed.

Wait, no, that might not be the case. Maybe when we rotate the octagon, the colors move along with the vertices. So, for example, if vertex 1 is blue, and I rotate the octagon so that vertex 2 is now in position 1, then vertex 1's color (blue) would now be at position 2. So the colors are moving with the rotation.

Wait, I think that's correct. So, when you rotate the octagon, the colors move along with their respective vertices. So, the color assignments are attached to the vertices, not to the positions. So, if I rotate the octagon, the colors are permuted according to the rotation.

Therefore, the question is: Given a random coloring of the octagon's vertices, what is the probability that there exists a rotation (i.e., a permutation of the vertices) such that the image of the blue vertices under this permutation is exactly the set of red vertices.

Another way to phrase it is: The set of blue vertices is a rotated version of the set of red vertices. So, in other words, the set of blue vertices is a translate (in the cyclic group of order
