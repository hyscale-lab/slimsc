Okay, so I have this problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me try to understand what's being asked.

We have three points: O at (0,0), A at (1/2, 0), and B at (0, sqrt(3)/2). So, O is the origin, A is halfway along the x-axis between O and (1,0), and B is somewhere along the y-axis. Let me visualize this. If I plot these points, O is the origin, A is at (0.5, 0), and B is at (0, approximately 0.866). So, the line AB connects these two points.

Now, the family F consists of segments PQ of unit length, lying in the first quadrant, with P on the x-axis and Q on the y-axis. So, each segment PQ is a line segment from some point P on the x-axis to some point Q on the y-axis, with the length of PQ being 1. Since they are in the first quadrant, all these points are in the positive x and y regions.

The problem states that there is a unique point C on AB, distinct from A and B, that doesn't belong to any segment from F other than AB itself. So, point C is on AB, and no other segment from the family F passes through C except for AB. Our goal is to find OC squared, which is the square of the distance from the origin to point C, and express it as a fraction p/q where p and q are coprime. Then, we need to find p + q.

Hmm, okay. So, I need to find point C on AB such that no other segment PQ (from family F) passes through C except AB. So, C is somehow a special point that only AB from family F passes through it.

Let me think about the family F. Each PQ is a unit segment from x-axis to y-axis in the first quadrant. So, parametric equations for such segments can be written. Let me denote P as (p, 0) and Q as (0, q). The distance between P and Q is 1, so sqrt(p^2 + q^2) = 1. Therefore, p^2 + q^2 = 1.

But since both p and q are positive (they are in the first quadrant), we can express q in terms of p: q = sqrt(1 - p^2). So, each such segment can be represented as the line connecting (p, 0) to (0, sqrt(1 - p^2)).

Alternatively, we can parametrize all such lines. The equation of the line PQ can be written as (x/p) + (y/q) = 1. Since p^2 + q^2 = 1, this is the equation of a straight line intercepting the x-axis at p and y-axis at q, with p and q satisfying p^2 + q^2 = 1.

Now, the family F consists of all such lines for p in (0,1). So, p varies from 0 to 1, and q varies from 1 to 0 accordingly.

Point C is on AB, so let's first find the equation of AB to describe point C.

Points A and B are at (1/2, 0) and (0, sqrt(3)/2). The line AB can be found using the two-point form.

The slope m of AB is (sqrt(3)/2 - 0)/(0 - 1/2) = (sqrt(3)/2)/(-1/2) = -sqrt(3). So, the equation is y - 0 = -sqrt(3)(x - 1/2), which simplifies to y = -sqrt(3)x + (sqrt(3)/2).

So, any point C on AB can be written as (x, -sqrt(3)x + sqrt(3)/2) for x between 0 and 1/2.

Now, the key part is to find point C on AB such that no other segment from F besides AB passes through C. So, for point C, the only line from F that passes through it is AB itself. All other lines from F do not pass through C.

So, this is similar to saying that C is an intersection point only of AB and no other line in F.

Therefore, to find such a point C, we need to find a point on AB such that there's no other line in F passing through it. So, for all other lines in F (i.e., lines PQ where PQ is not AB), the point C does not lie on them.

Alternatively, for point C = (x, y), lying on AB, and for any other PQ in F (i.e., any other line in F), the point C is not on PQ.

So, perhaps we can find such a point C by ensuring that it's the only point on AB that lies on some PQ, or more precisely, that for C, the only PQ in F that passes through it is AB.

Wait, no. It's that C lies on AB, and when we consider all possible PQ in F, C is only on AB and none of the others. So, for every other PQ in F, C is not on PQ.

So, perhaps we can model
