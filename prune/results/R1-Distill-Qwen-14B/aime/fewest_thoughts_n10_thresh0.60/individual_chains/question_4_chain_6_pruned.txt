Okay, so I've got this problem where Alice and Bob are playing a game with a stack of n tokens. They take turns removing either 1 or 4 tokens, and the person who takes the last token wins. I need to figure out how many positive integers n â‰¤ 2024 allow Bob to have a winning strategy, no matter how Alice plays.

Hmm, let's start by understanding the game mechanics. Since Alice goes first, Bob can only win if he can force the game into a state where Alice is always at a disadvantage. So, I should probably look for some pattern or mathematical structure that determines the winning and losing positions.

In game theory, a position is called a "winning position" if the current player can force a win, and a "losing position" if no matter what the current player does, the opponent can force a win.

Let me try to model this. Let's denote positions as either winning (W) or losing (L). The base case is when there are 0 tokens left; the game is over, so that's a losing position because the player who just moved took the last token.

Wait, no, actually, the player who takes the last token wins. So if it's your turn and there are 0 tokens, you can't move and thus lose. So 0 is an L position.

Now, let's build from there. For n=1, the current player can take 1 token and win, so that's W.

n=2: Current player can take 1 token, leaving 1 for the opponent, who will then take it and win. Or, can the current player take 4 tokens? No, because 4>2. So the only move is to take 1, leaving 1, which is a W position for the opponent. So n=2 is L?

Wait, no, because if I'm at n=2, I take 1, leaving 1, and the opponent can take 1 and win. So n=2 is a losing position because any move I make allows the opponent to win. Wait, but wait, no: if I take 1, opponent is at n=1, which is a W position for them. So n=2 is L for me.

Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of Grundy numbers or mex (minimum excludant). Let me try to compute the Grundy numbers for small n.

Grundy(n) is the mex (minimum excludant) of the set {Grundy(n-1), Grundy(n-4)} because from n, you can move to n-1 or n-4.

Wait, but let's see:

Grundy(0) = 0 (base case)
n=1: possible moves to 0, so mex{Grundy(0)}= mex{0} =1
n=2: possible moves to 1, so mex{Grundy(1)}= mex{1}=0
n=3: moves to 2, so mex{Grundy(2)}= mex{0}=1
n=4: moves to 3 or 0, so mex{Grundy(3), Grundy(0)} = mex{1,0}=2
n=5: moves to 4 or 1, so mex{Grundy(4), Grundy(1)} = mex{
