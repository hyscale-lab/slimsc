Okay, so I've got this math problem here, and I need to find the smallest sphere that can contain any rectangular box from the set B. Each box in B has a surface area of 54 and a volume of 23. The goal is to find the square of the radius of this smallest sphere, express it as a fraction p/q where p and q are coprime, and then find p + q. Hmm, let me break this down step by step.

First, I should recall that a rectangular box has three dimensions: length, width, and height. Let me denote them as x, y, and z. So, the surface area S and volume V of such a box are given by the formulas:

S = 2(xy + yz + xz)  
V = xyz

In this problem, S is 54 and V is 23. So I can write:

2(xy + yz + xz) = 54  
xyz = 23

I can simplify the surface area equation by dividing both sides by 2:

xy + yz + xz = 27

So now I have two equations:

1. xy + yz + xz = 27  
2. xyz = 23

My next thought is about the sphere that can contain the box. The sphere must encompass the entire box, so the diameter of the sphere must be at least as large as the space diagonal of the box. The space diagonal d of a rectangular box can be found using the formula:

d = sqrt(x² + y² + z²)

Since the diameter of the sphere is equal to the space diagonal, the radius r of the sphere is half of that:

r = d / 2  
r² = (d²) / 4  
r² = (x² + y² + z²) / 4

So, to find r², I need to find the minimum value of (x² + y² + z²) for all boxes in set B, then divide by 4.

Now, the challenge is to minimize x² + y² + z² given the constraints on S and V. I remember from algebra that for optimization problems with constraints, methods like Lagrange multipliers can be useful. But since I might not be too familiar with multivariable calculus, maybe I can find a way using AM-GM inequalities or other algebraic methods.

Let me think about this. I have three variables x, y, z, and two equations. It might be helpful to express one variable in terms of the others. Let's try to express z from the volume equation:

xyz = 23  
=> z = 23 / (xy)

Now substitute this into the surface area equation:

xy + y*(23/(xy)) + x*(23/(xy)) = 27

Simplify each term:

xy + (23 / x) + (23 / y) = 27

Hmm, this seems a bit complicated, but maybe I can let t = x + y and s = xy. Then, perhaps express the equation in terms of t and s.

Wait, no, let's see. Let me see if I can find a relation between x and y.

Wait another thought: The expression we're trying to minimize is x² + y² + z². Let's substitute z from the volume equation into this:

x² + y² + (23/(xy))²

So, the expression becomes:

x² + y² + (529)/(x² y²)

Hmm, that looks even more complicated. Maybe I can consider symmetry here. If I assume that the minimum occurs when two variables are equal, say x = y, then maybe it simplifies the problem.

Let me try that. Let x = y. Then, since x = y, let's denote them both as x. Then, z can be expressed as:

z = 23 / (x * x) = 23 / x²

Now, substitute x and z into the surface area equation:

xy + yz + xz = x² + x*z + x*z = x² + 2x*z = 27

But z is 23 / x², so:

x² + 2x*(23/x²) = 27  
x² + (46 / x) = 27

Multiply both sides by x to eliminate the denominator:

x³ + 46 = 27x  
x³ - 27x + 46 = 0

So, now I have a cubic equation: x³ - 27x + 46 = 0

I need to find real roots of this equation. Let me try plugging in small integer values to see if any of them satisfy the equation.

Testing x=1: 1 - 27 + 46 = 20 ≠ 0  
x=2: 8 - 54 + 46 = 0 → 0! So x=2 is a root.

Great, so (x - 2) is a factor. Let's perform polynomial division or factorization.

Divide x³ -27x +46 by (x - 2):

Using synthetic division:

2 | 1  0  -27  46  
        2   4  -46  
      1  2  -23  0

So the cubic factors as (x - 2)(x² + 2x -23) = 0

Set each factor to zero:

x - 2 = 0 → x = 2  
x² + 2x -23 = 0 → x = [-2 ± sqrt(4 + 92)] / 2 = [-2 ± sqrt(96)] / 2 = [-2 ± 4*sqrt(6)] / 2 = -1 ± 2*sqrt(6)

Since x represents a length, it must be positive. So, x = -1 + 2*sqrt(6) is approximately -1 + 4.898 ≈ 3.898, which is positive. The other root is negative, so we discard it.

So, the possible solutions are x=2 and x=-1 + 2*sqrt(6). Let's check if these are minima.

Wait, but in our substitution, we assumed x=y. So, for x=2, y=2, z=23/(2*2)=23/4=5.75

Then, x² + y² + z² = 4 + 4 + (529/16) = 8 + 33.0625 = 41.0625

Which is 657/16. So r² would be (657/16)/4 = 657/64. Hmm, but maybe the other solution gives a smaller value.

Wait, let's compute x=-1 + 2*sqrt(6). Let me calculate that:

sqrt(6) ≈ 2.449  
2*sqrt(6) ≈ 4.898  
-1 + 4.898 ≈ 3.898

So x ≈ 3.898, y = x ≈ 3.898, z = 23/(x²) = 23/(~15.19) ≈ 1.514

Compute x² + y² + z² ≈ (3.898)^2 + (3.898)^2 + (1.514)^2 ≈ 15.19 + 15.19 + 2.29 ≈ 32.67

Which is about 32.67, which is less than 41.06. So, this is a better (smaller) value. Therefore, the minimal x² + y² + z² would probably be around 32.67, but let me find the exact value.

Wait, but I need to compute it exactly, not approximately. So let's compute x for the case where x = y = -1 + 2*sqrt(6):

x = -1 + 2*sqrt(6)

So, x² = (-1 + 2√6)^2 = 1 -4√6 + 24 = 25 -4√6

Wait, let me compute that:

(-1 + 2√6)^2 = (-1)^2 + (2√6)^2 + 2*(-1)*(2√6) = 1 + 24 - 4√6 = 25 -4√6

So x² = 25 -4√6. Since x = y, y² is also 25 -4√6.

z = 23/(x^2) = 23/(25 -4√6). To rationalize the denominator, multiply numerator and denominator by (25 +4√6):

z = 23*(25 +4√6) / [ (25)^2 - (4√6)^2 ) ] = 23*(25 +4√6)/(625 - 96) = 23*(25 +4√6)/529

Simplify denominator: 625 -96=529=23²

So z = (23*(25 +4√6))/23² = (25 +4√6)/23

So z² = (25 +4√6)^2 / (23)^2

Compute numerator: (25 +4√6)^2 = 25² + 2*25*4√6 + (4√6)^2 = 625 + 200√6 + 16*6 = 625 + 200√6 + 96 = 721 + 200√6

So z² = (721 + 200√6)/529

Now, compute x² + y² + z²:

Since x² and y² are each 25 -4√6, so x² + y² = 2*(25 -4√6) = 50 -8√6

Adding z²: 50 -8√6 + (721 + 200√6)/529

Combine terms:

Let me write 50 as (50*529)/529 = 26450/529

Similarly, -8√6 as (-8√6 *529)/529 = (-4232√6)/529

So,

x² + y² + z² = [26450/529] + [ (-4232√6)/529 ] + [ (721 + 200√6)/529 ]

Combine numerators:

26450 + (-4232√6) + 721 + 200√6 all over 529.

Combine like terms:

26450 +721 = 27171  
-4232√6 +200√6 = (-4232 +200)√6 = (-4032)√6

So total numerator: 27171 -4032√6

Thus,

x² + y² + z² = (27171 -4032√6)/529

Hmm, that seems complicated. Maybe I made a mistake in calculation. Let me check.

Wait, when I computed x², I had x = -1 + 2√6, so x² was 25 -4√6. Yes, that's correct.

Then, z = 23/(25 -4√6) = (25 +4√6)/23, so z² is (25 +4√6)^2 / 23². That's correct.

Wait, but (25 +4√6)^2 is 25² = 625, (4√6)^2 = 16*6=96, and cross term 2*25*4√6=200√6. So 625 + 96 = 721, plus 200√6. Correct.

So z² is (721 +200√6)/529.

Then, x² + y² = 2*(25 -4√6) = 50 -8√6. Correct.

So when adding, 50 -8√6 + (721 +200√6)/529.

So, to combine, I need to have a common denominator of 529.

Express 50 as (50*529)/529 = 26450/529

Express -8√6 as (-8√6 *529)/529 = (-4232√6)/529

Then, adding all together:

26450/529 -4232√6/529 +721/529 +200√6/529

= (26450 +721)/529 + (-4232√6 +200√6)/529

= (27171)/529 + (-4032√6)/529

So, x² + y² + z² = (27171 -4032√6)/529

Hmm, that seems correct. But that's a complicated fraction. I wonder if there's a better approach.

Wait, maybe I shouldn't assume x = y. Perhaps the minimal occurs when all variables are equal, i.e., when the box is a cube. But wait, for a cube, x = y = z.

Let me check if that's possible. For a cube, surface area is 6x² =54 → x²=9 → x=3. Then volume would be 27, but in our case, the volume is 23. So, no, a cube isn't in set B. Therefore, the
