Okay, so I have this problem about a convex equilateral hexagon. Let me try to unpack what that means and how I can approach solving it.

First off, the hexagon is convex and equilateral. Convex means all the interior angles are less than 180 degrees, so none of the sides bend inwards. Equilateral means all the sides are equal in length. So, each side AB, BC, CD, DE, EF, and FA are all the same length, which I'll call 's'. That's the value I need to find.

The problem also mentions that all pairs of opposite sides are parallel. So, AB is parallel to DE, BC is parallel to EF, and CD is parallel to FA. This is a key property that might help me relate the sides of the triangle formed by extending AB, CD, and EF to the sides of the hexagon.

Now, the triangle formed by extending AB, CD, and EF has side lengths of 200, 240, and 300. Let me visualize that. If I extend AB, CD, and EF until they meet, they form a triangle. The sides of this triangle are 200, 240, and 300. Hmm, those numbers look familiar. They might form a Pythagorean triple since 200² + 240² = 40000 + 57600 = 97600, and 300² is 90000. Wait, that's not equal, so maybe it's not a right triangle. Alternatively, let me check if 200:240:300 can be simplified. Dividing each by 20 gives 10:12:15. 10² + 12² = 100 + 144 = 244, which isn't 225 (15²), so no, it's not a right triangle. Maybe it's just a scalene triangle.

I need to relate the sides of this triangle to the sides of the hexagon. Since the hexagon is equilateral and has opposite sides parallel, it's similar to a regular hexagon but not necessarily regular because the angles might not all be equal.

Wait, in a regular hexagon, all sides are equal and all opposite sides are parallel, but here, since it's convex and equilateral with opposite sides parallel, but not necessarily regular, the angles can vary.

But maybe I can model this hexagon as a centrally symmetric hexagon. In a centrally symmetric polygon, for every point (x, y), there's a point (-x, -y). So, maybe the hexagon can be thought of as having a center, and each pair of opposite sides are symmetric around this center.

If that's the case, then when we extend
