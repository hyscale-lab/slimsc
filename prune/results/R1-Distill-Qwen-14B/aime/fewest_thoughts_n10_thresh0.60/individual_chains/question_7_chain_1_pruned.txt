Okay, so I've got this problem about coloring the vertices of a regular octagon either red or blue, each with equal probability. The question is about finding the probability that after coloring, there's a rotation that turns all blue vertices into positions where originally there were red vertices. Hmm, that's a bit of a mouthful, but let me break it down.

First, the octagon is regular, so it has eight sides, and each vertex is the same distance from the center. Since it's regular, it has rotational symmetry. That means if I rotate it by 45 degrees (which is 360/8), it'll look the same. So the symmetries here are rotations by multiples of 45 degrees: 0°, 45°, 90°, ..., 315°, which gives me eight possible rotations.

Each vertex is colored either red or blue independently with a 50-50 chance. So each coloring is a sequence of eight colors, each either R or B. The total number of colorings is 2^8, which is 256. That's my denominator for the probability.

Now, the problem is about the probability that there exists a rotation such that when we apply that rotation, every blue vertex moves to a position that was originally red. So, in other words, if I rotate the octagon by some angle, all the blue vertices end up where there were reds before.

Wait, I need to clarify: when we rotate, each blue vertex moves to a new position. We want that, after rotation, all the positions that were blue in the original coloring are now red. So, for a rotation to satisfy this condition, every blue vertex must be mapped to a red vertex. That is, the image of each blue vertex under the rotation must be a red vertex.

Alternatively, since the octagon is being rotated, the colors are permuted. So, the condition is that the set of blue vertices is a subset of the images of red vertices under some rotation. Wait, no, more precisely, after rotation, the blue positions must all have been red before.

Wait, maybe another way: Let’s think of the octagon as a graph with 8 vertices, each connected in a cycle. Coloring each vertex red or blue. We need to find colorings such that there exists a rotation (element of the rotation group) that maps each blue vertex to a red vertex. So, in group theory terms, for some group
