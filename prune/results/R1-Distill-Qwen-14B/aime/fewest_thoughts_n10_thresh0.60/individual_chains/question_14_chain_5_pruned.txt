Okay, so I have this math problem to solve. Let me read it again and try to understand what's being asked.

The problem is: Let N be the greatest four-digit positive integer with the property that whenever one of its digits is changed to 1, the resulting number is divisible by 7. Then, Q and R are the quotient and remainder when N is divided by 1000. I need to find Q + R.

Hmm, that's a bit of a mouthful, but let's break it down. First, N is a four-digit number, so it's between 1000 and 9999. It's the greatest such number with this specific property. The property is that if you change any one of its digits to 1, the resulting number is divisible by 7. That's interesting.

So, for example, if N is a four-digit number ABCD, then changing A to 1 gives 1BCD, changing B to 1 gives A1CD, changing C to 1 gives AB1D, and changing D to 1 gives ABC1. Each of these should be divisible by 7.

Our goal is to find the largest possible N with this property. Then, once we have N, we divide it by 1000, which means Q is the thousands digit (since 1000 goes into N Q times, and R is the remainder, which would be the last three digits). Then, Q + R is the sum we're looking for.

Alright, so first step is to find N. Let's think about what constraints this property imposes on N.

Let me denote N as a four-digit number: N = 1000a + 100b + 10c + d, where a, b, c, d are digits from 0 to 9, and a is at least 1 since it's a four-digit number.

The condition is that changing any one digit to 1 results in a number divisible by 7. So, each of the numbers:

1. Changing a to 1: 1000*1 + 100b + 10c + d = 1000 + 100b + 10c + d
2. Changing b to 1: 1000a + 100*1 + 10c + d = 1000a + 100 + 10c + d
3. Changing c to 1: 1000a + 100b + 10*1 + d = 1000a + 100b + 10 + d
4. Changing d to 1: 1000a + 100b + 10c + 1

Each of these four numbers must be divisible by 7.

So, let's write down the conditions mathematically. For each case, the number modulo 7 must be 0.

Case 1: 1000 + 100b + 10c + d ≡ 0 mod 7

Case 2: 1000a + 100 + 10c + d ≡ 0 mod 7

Case 3: 1000a + 100b + 10 + d ≡ 0 mod 7

Case 4: 1000a + 100b + 10c + 1 ≡ 0 mod 7

I need all four of these to be congruent to 0 modulo 7.

But wait, N itself is 1000a + 100b + 10c + d. Let me call that N. So, N = 1000a + 100b + 10c + d.

Now, for each case, when I change a digit to 1, I'm effectively subtracting the original digit's contribution and adding 1 in that place.

For example, changing a to 1: the new number is 1000 + 100b + 10c + d = 1000 + (N - 1000a). So, the new number is (N - 1000a) + 1000. So, the difference between the new number and N is (1000 - 1000a).

Similarly, for changing b to 1: the new number is 100 + 10c + d + 1000a = (N - 100b) + 100. So, difference is (100 - 100b).

Wait, perhaps it's better to express each modified number in terms of N and see the relation.

Alternatively, perhaps express each case as:

Case 1: (N - a*1000) + 1*1000 ≡ 0 mod 7

Which is N - a*1000 + 1000 ≡ 0 mod 7

Similarly, Case 2: N - b*100 + 1*100 ≡ 0 mod 7

Case 3: N - c*10 + 1*10 ≡ 0 mod 7

Case 4: N - d + 1 ≡ 0 mod 7

Wait, that seems like a good approach. So, for each case, the modified number is N minus the original digit times its place value plus 1 times that place value.

So, for each digit position, the modified number is N - (digit * place) + (1 * place). Therefore, the modified number is N + (1 - digit) * place.

Since the modified number must be congruent to 0 mod 7, and N is the original number, let's write each condition:

Case 1 (changing thousands
