Okay, so I have this problem here: I need to find the largest possible real part of the expression (75 + 117i)z + (96 + 144i)/z, where z is a complex number with |z| = 4. Hmm, that sounds a bit complicated, but I'll try to break it down step by step.

First, let me understand what's given. We have z as a complex number, and its magnitude is 4. So, |z| = 4. That means if I write z in polar form, it would be z = 4e^{iθ}, where θ is the argument of z. Alternatively, z can also be written as a + bi, but maybe polar form will be more useful here because of the division by z.

The expression we need to maximize the real part of is (75 + 117i)z + (96 + 144i)/z. Let me denote this expression as E. So,

E = (75 + 117i)z + (96 + 144i)/z.

Since z ≠ 0 (because |z|=4), we can safely perform the division. Also, since |z|=4, we know that 1/z is equal to the conjugate of z divided by |z|². Wait, yes, because for any complex number z, 1/z = conjugate(z)/|z|². Since |z|=4, |z|² = 16, so 1/z = conjugate(z)/16. That might come in handy.

Let me write E in terms of z and its conjugate. Let’s denote z = a + bi, so conjugate(z) = a - bi. Then, 1/z = (a - bi)/16. So, substituting into E:

E = (75 + 117i)(a + bi) + (96 + 144i)(a - bi)/16.

Hmm, that might be a bit messy. Maybe instead, I can write z as 4e^{iθ}, since |z|=4. Then, 1/z = (1/4)e^{-iθ}. Let me try that approach.

Expressing z as 4e^{iθ}, so E becomes:

E = (75 + 117i)(4e^{iθ}) + (96 + 144i)(1/(4e^{iθ})).

Simplify this:

First term: 4*(75 + 117i)e^{iθ} = (300 + 468i)e^{iθ}.

Second term: (96 + 144i)/(4e^{iθ}) = (24 + 36i)/e^{iθ} = (24 + 36i)e^{-iθ}.

So E = (300 + 468i)e^{iθ} + (24 + 36i)e^{-iθ}.

Now, I can write E as a sum of two complex exponentials. Let me denote A = 300 + 468i and B = 24 + 36i. So E = A e^{iθ} + B e^{-iθ}.

Now, the real part of E is Re(E) = Re(A e^{iθ} + B e^{-iθ}) = Re(A e^{iθ}) + Re(B e^{-iθ}).

Since Re(B e^{-iθ}) is the same as Re(conj(B) e^{iθ}), because e^{-iθ} is the conjugate of e^{iθ}. So alternatively, Re(B e^{-iθ}) = Re(conj(B) e^{iθ}).

So, let me compute A and B.

A is 300 + 468i, which can be represented in polar form as |A| e^{iφ}, where φ is the argument of A. Similarly, B is 24 + 36i, which can be represented as |B| e^{iψ}.

The real part of A e^{iθ} is |A| cos(θ - φ), because when you multiply two complex exponentials, their angles add. Similarly, Re(B e^{-iθ}) = Re(|B| e^{iψ} e^{-iθ}) = |B| cos
