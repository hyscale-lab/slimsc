Okay, so I've got this problem here: there are real numbers x and y, both greater than 1, such that log base x of y^x equals 10, and log base y of x^{4y} also equals 10. I need to find the product xy. Hmm, okay, let me try to unpack this step by step.

First, I remember that logarithms can be tricky, but they have some useful properties that I can probably apply here. Let me write down the equations as given:

1. log_x(y^x) = 10
2. log_y(x^{4y}) = 10

Alright, so both of these logarithms equal 10. I think I can simplify these using logarithm rules. Let me recall them. One important property is that log_b(a^c) = c * log_b(a). So maybe I can apply that here.

Starting with the first equation: log_x(y^x) = 10. Applying the power rule, that becomes x * log_x(y) = 10. Hmm, that's better. So, x multiplied by log base x of y equals 10.

Similarly, for the second equation: log_y(x^{4y}) = 10. Applying the same power rule, that becomes 4y * log_y(x) = 10.

So now I have two equations:

1. x * log_x(y) = 10
2. 4y * log_y(x) = 10

Hmm, okay. Now, I notice that log_x(y) and log_y(x) are related. I remember another logarithm property: log_b(a) = 1 / log_a(b). So, log_x(y) is equal to 1 / log_y(x). That might be helpful here.

Let me denote log_x(y) as A. Then, log_y(x) would be 1/A. So substituting that into the equations:

1. x * A = 10
2. 4y * (1/A) = 10

So now I have two equations with two variables, x and y, but also involving A. Maybe I can express x and y in terms of A and then find a relationship between them.

From the first equation: x = 10 / A.

From the second equation: 4y * (1/A) = 10 => y = (10 * A) / 4 => y = (5A)/2.

Okay, so now I have expressions for x and y in terms of A. Let me write them down:

x = 10 / A

y = (5A) / 2

Now, I need to find another equation that relates x and y. I know that x and y are related through the original logarithmic equations, so maybe I can express log_x(y) in terms of x and y, or perhaps use the change of base formula.

Wait, I already have log_x(y) = A, and log_y(x) = 1/A. Alternatively, I can express y in terms of x using logarithms.

Alternatively, I can think about expressing y as x raised to some power. Let me see.

From logarithm definitions, log_x(y) = A means that x^A = y. So y = x^A.

But I already have expressions for x and y in terms of A. Let me substitute x from above into this equation.

x is 10/A, so y = (10/A)^A.

But from earlier, y is also equal to (5A)/2. So:

(10/A)^A = (5A)/2

Hmm, that seems a bit complicated, but maybe I can take the natural logarithm of both sides to make it more manageable. Let me try that.

Take ln of both sides:

ln[(10/A)^A] = ln[(5A)/2]

Using the power rule for logarithms on the left side:

A * ln(10/A) = ln(5A) - ln(2)

Hmm, okay. Let's expand the left side:

A * [ln(10) - ln(A)] = ln(5A) - ln(2)

Let me distribute the A:

A * ln(10) - A * ln(A) = ln(5) + ln(A) - ln(2)

Hmm, this might get a bit messy, but perhaps I can collect like terms. Let's see:

Bring all the terms involving ln(A) to one side and the rest to the other side.

So:

A * ln(10) - A * ln(A) - ln(A) = ln(5) - ln(2)

Factor ln(A) terms:

A * ln(10) - ln(A) * (A + 1) = ln(5) - ln(2)

Hmm, this is a transcendental equation, meaning it's not straightforward to solve algebraically. Maybe I can try to see if A is an integer or a simple fraction, which might make the equation hold.

Let me think of possible integer values for A. Let's try A=2.

Plugging A=2 into the equation:

Left side: 2*ln(10) - ln(2)*(2+1) = 2 ln(10) - 3 ln(2)

Right side: ln(5) - ln(2) = ln(5/2)

Compute left side numerically:

2 ln(10) ≈ 2 * 2.302585 ≈ 4.60517

3 ln(2) ≈ 3 * 0.693147 ≈ 2.07944

So left side ≈ 4.60517 - 2.07944 ≈ 2.52573

Right side: ln(5/2) ≈ ln(2.5) ≈ 0.916291

So 2.52573 ≈ 0.916291? No, that's not equal. So A=2 is not a solution.

How about A=3?

Left side: 3 ln(10) - 4 ln(2) ≈ 3*2.302585 - 4*0.693147 ≈ 6.907755 - 2.772588 ≈ 4.135167

Right side: ln(5/2) ≈ 0.916291. Not equal.

How about A=1?

Left side: 1 * ln(10) - 2 ln(2) ≈ 2.302585 - 1.386294 ≈ 0.916291

Right side: ln(5/2) ≈ 0.916291

Hey, that's the same as the right side! So A=1 gives both sides equal to approximately 0.916291.

Wait, so A=1 is a solution? Let me check.

If A=1, then from our earlier equations:

x = 10 / A = 10

y = (5A)/2 = 5/2 = 2.5

So x=10, y=2.5.

Let me check if these values satisfy the original logarithmic equations.

First equation: log_x(y^x) = log_10( (2.5)^10 )

Wait, (2.5)^10 is 9536.74316... Let's compute log_10(9536.74316). Since 10^
