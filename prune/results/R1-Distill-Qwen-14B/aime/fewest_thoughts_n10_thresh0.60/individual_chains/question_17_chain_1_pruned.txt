Okay, so I have this problem about rectangular boxes with a given surface area and volume, and I need to find the radius of the smallest sphere that can contain any such box. Then, I have to express r squared as a fraction p/q and find p + q. Hmm, let me try to break this down.

First, let's recall that a rectangular box has length, width, and height, which I'll denote as x, y, and z. The surface area (SA) of a rectangular box is given by 2(xy + yz + zx), and the volume (V) is xyz. The problem states that SA = 54 and V = 23. So we have:

2(xy + yz + zx) = 54 → xy + yz + zx = 27

And,

xyz = 23

Our goal is to find the smallest sphere that can contain any such box. The sphere's radius will be half the space diagonal of the box because the sphere must enclose the entire box, and the space diagonal is the longest distance inside the box. The space diagonal d of the box is given by sqrt(x² + y² + z²). Therefore, the radius r is d/2, so r² = (x² + y² + z²)/4.

Hence, to find r², I need to find x² + y² + z² and then divide by 4.

So, I need to express x² + y² + z² in terms of the given surface area and volume. Hmm, how can I relate x² + y² + z² to the known quantities?

I remember that (x + y + z)² = x² + y² + z² + 2(xy + yz + zx). So if I can find (x + y + z), then I can find x² + y² + z² using this identity.

But I don't know x + y + z directly. Maybe I can find another relation. Alternatively, perhaps I can use the method of Lagrange multipliers to minimize or maximize x² + y² + z² given the constraints on surface area and volume. Since the sphere's radius is the maximum over all possible boxes, I need to find the maximum of x² + y² + z² under the given constraints.

Wait, no, actually, since all boxes in set B have SA=54 and V=23, and I need the smallest sphere that can contain any of them. That would mean I need to find the maximum value of the space diagonal among all boxes in B, so the maximum x² + y² + z². Then, the radius would be half of that maximum space diagonal.

So, the problem reduces to maximizing x² + y² + z² given that xy + yz + zx = 27 and xyz = 23.

Hmm, how to approach this. Maybe using Lagrange multipliers. Let's set up the function to maximize f(x,y,z) = x² + y² + z², subject to the constraints g(x,y,z) = xy + yz + zx = 27 and h(x,y,z) = xyz = 23.

Wait, but Lagrange multipliers with two constraints might get a bit complicated. Alternatively, perhaps we can assume symmetry or use substitution.

But in the case of rectangular boxes, the maximum space diagonal might not necessarily occur at a symmetric point. So symmetry might not help here. Hmm.

Another approach: Since we have two equations, we can try expressing variables in terms of each other. Let's think about if we can express one variable in terms of the others.

Let me denote S = x + y + z, P = xy + yz + zx = 27, and V = xyz = 23.

We know that x, y, z are the roots of the cubic equation t^3 - S t^2 + P t - V = 0, which is t^3 - S t^2 + 27 t - 23 = 0.

But I'm not sure if that helps directly. Maybe I can find S in another way.

Wait, from the identity (x + y + z)^2 = x² + y² + z² + 2(xy + yz + zx), so x² + y² + z² = S^2 - 2P = S^2 - 54.

So, our target is to find the maximum x² + y² + z², which is S² - 54, so we need to find the maximum S², meaning we need to find the maximum S. So, maximizing S would maximize x² + y² + z².

Wait, no, actually, if S is maximum, then x² + y² + z² is maximum. But I'm not sure if S is directly related. Alternatively, perhaps S is bounded, and we can find its maximum.

Alternatively, maybe we can use the method of Lagrange multipliers.

Let me set up the Lagrangian function. Let’s say we want to maximize f(x, y, z) = x² + y² + z², subject to g(x, y, z) = xy + yz + zx = 27 and h(x, y, z) = xyz = 23.

The Lagrangian would be:

L = x² + y² + z² - λ(xy + yz + zx - 27) - μ(xyz - 23)

Taking partial derivatives with respect to x, y, z, and setting them to zero.

Compute ∂L/∂x = 2x - λ(y + z) - μ(yz) = 0

Similarly,

∂L/∂y = 2y - λ(x + z) - μ(xz) = 0

∂L/∂z = 2z - λ(x + y) - μ(xy) = 0

So, we have the system of equations:

2x = λ(y + z) + μ(yz)  ...(1)

2y = λ(x + z) + μ(xz)  ...(2)

2z = λ(x + y) + μ(xy)  ...(3)

And the constraints:

xy + yz + zx = 27     ...(4)

xyz = 23              ...(5)

So, we have five equations with five variables: x, y, z, λ, μ.

Hmm, this looks complicated, but maybe we can find a relationship between x, y, z.

Let me subtract equation (1) from equation (2):

2y - 2x = λ(x + z - y - z) + μ(xz - yz)

Simplify:

2(y - x) = λ(x - y) + μ z (x - y)

Factor out (x - y):

2(y - x) = (x - y)(λ - μ z )

Which can be written as:

2(y - x) = -(y - x)(λ - μ z )

Assuming y ≠ x, we can divide both sides by (y - x):

2 = -(λ - μ z )

So,

2 = -λ + μ z → λ = μ z - 2  ...(6)

Similarly, subtract equation (2) from equation (3):

2z - 2y = λ(x + y - x - z) + μ(x y - x z )

Simplify:

2(z - y) = λ(y - z) + μ x (y - z )

Factor out (y - z):

2(z - y) = (y - z)(λ - μ x )

Which is:

2(z - y) = - (z - y)(λ - μ x )

Assuming z ≠ y,

2 = - (λ - μ x )

→ 2 = -λ + μ x → λ = μ x - 2 ...(7)

From equations (6) and (7):

μ z - 2 = μ x - 2 → μ z = μ x

If μ ≠ 0, then z = x.

Similarly, if we subtract equation (1) from equation (3):

2z - 2x = λ(x + y - y - z) + μ(x y - y z )

Simplify:

2(z - x) = λ(x - z) + μ y (x - z )

Factor:

2(z - x) = (x - z)(λ - μ y )

Which is:

2(z - x) = - (z - x)(λ - μ y )

Assuming z ≠ x,

2 = - (λ - μ y )

→ 2 = -λ + μ y → λ = μ y - 2 ...(8)

From (6) and (8):

μ z - 2 = μ y - 2 → μ z = μ y

If μ ≠ 0, then z = y.

Wait, if z = x and z = y, then
