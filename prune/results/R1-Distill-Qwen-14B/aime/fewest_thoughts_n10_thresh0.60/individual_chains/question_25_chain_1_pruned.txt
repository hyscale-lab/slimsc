Okay, so I've got this math problem here about residents in Aimeville and the things they own. Let me try to break it down. Hmm. So, there are 900 residents in total. Each of them owns a bag of candy hearts. Then, some own a diamond ring, some own a set of golf clubs, and some own a garden spade. 

Wait, the numbers are 195 diamond ring owners, 367 golf club owners, and 562 garden spade owners. Plus everyone owns candy hearts. So, candy hearts are the fourth thing. 

The problem says that 437 residents own exactly two of these things, and 234 own exactly three. The question is asking how many own all four. Okay, so I need to find the number of residents who have all four items.

Hmm. This seems like a problem that can be solved using the principle of inclusion-exclusion. I remember that inclusion-exclusion helps in calculating the union of multiple sets by adding the sizes of the sets, subtracting the intersections, adding back the triple overlaps, and so on.

Let me recall the formula for four sets. The total number of elements in the union of four sets A, B, C, and D is equal to the sum of the sizes of each set minus the sum of all pairwise intersections plus the sum of all triple-wise intersections minus the size of the four-way intersection.

Wait, but in this case, the total number of residents is 900 because everyone owns at least the candy hearts. So, actually, the union of all these sets is 900. Because even if someone doesn't own any of the other three, they still own the candy hearts, so they're included.

But wait, let me think again. No, actually, the problem says "each of the 900 residents owns a bag of candy hearts." So, yes, the union of all four sets is 900, because everyone is counted in at least one set (the candy hearts set). 

So, now, the inclusion-exclusion formula for four sets is:

|A ∪ B ∪ C ∪ D| = |A| + |B| + |C| + |D| 
                - |A∩B| - |A∩C| - |A∩D| - |B∩C| - |B∩D| - |C∩
