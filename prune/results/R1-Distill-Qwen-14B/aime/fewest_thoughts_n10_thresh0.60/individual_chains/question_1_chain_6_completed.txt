Okay, so I've got this problem with three variables x, y, z, all positive real numbers. They're satisfying a system of logarithmic equations, and I need to find the absolute value of log base 2 of (x^4 y^3 z^2), which will be a fraction m/n. Then I have to find m + n.

Let me write down the given equations:

1. log₂(x/(y z)) = 1/2
2. log₂(y/(x z)) = 1/3
3. log₂(z/(x y)) = 1/4

Hmm, logarithms can be tricky, but I remember that log_b(a) = c is equivalent to b^c = a. So maybe I can rewrite each equation in exponential form to make it easier to handle.

Starting with the first equation: log₂(x/(y z)) = 1/2. Converting this, 2^(1/2) = x/(y z). 2^(1/2) is the square root of 2, so sqrt(2) = x/(y z). Let me write that as equation (1a):

(1a) x = y z * sqrt(2)

Similarly, the second equation: log₂(y/(x z)) = 1/3. So 2^(1/3) = y/(x z). Let me write that as equation (2a):

(2a) y = x z * 2^(1/3)

Third equation: log₂(z/(x y)) = 1/4. So 2^(1/4) = z/(x y). Equation (3a):

(3a) z = x y * 2^(1/4)

Okay, so now I have three equations with x, y, z in terms of the others. Maybe I can substitute these into each other to find expressions for x, y, z.

Let me see. From (1a), x is expressed in terms of y and z. From (2a), y is in terms of x and z. From (3a), z is in terms of x and y. So perhaps I can substitute each into the other.

Let me try substituting equation (2a) into equation (1a). So equation (1a) says x = y z * sqrt(2). But y = x z * 2^(1/3), so substituting that into (1a):

x = (x z * 2^(1/3)) * z * sqrt(2)

Simplify that:

x = x z^2 * 2^(1/3) * sqrt(2)

Hmm, let's compute 2^(1/3) * sqrt(2). Since sqrt(2) is 2^(1/2), so 2^(1/3) * 2^(1/2) = 2^(1/3 + 1/2) = 2^( (2 + 3)/6 ) = 2^(5/6). So:

x = x z^2 * 2^(5/6)

Divide both sides by x (assuming x ≠ 0, which it isn't since it's positive):

1 = z^2 * 2^(5/6)

Then, solving for z^2:

z^2 = 1 / (2^(5/6)) = 2^(-5/6)

Take square root:

z = 2^(-5/12), since sqrt(2^(-5/6)) = 2^(-5/12). Since z is positive, we take the positive root.

So z = 2^(-5/12). Let me note this as equation (z).

Now, from equation (3a): z = x y * 2^(1/4). We can plug z into this equation and solve for x y.

So, 2^(-5/12) = x y * 2^(1/4)

Solve for x y:

x y = 2^(-5/12) / 2^(1/4) = 2^(-5/12 - 3/12) = 2^(-8/12) = 2^(-2/3)

So x y = 2^(-2/3). Let me call this equation (xy).

Similarly, let's go back to equation (2a): y = x z * 2^(1/3). We know z from equation (z), so let's substitute that.

y = x * 2^(-5/12) * 2^(1/3)

Compute 2^(-5/12) * 2^(1/3) = 2^(-5/12 + 4/12) = 2^(-1/12). So:

y = x * 2^(-1/12)

So y = x * 2^(-1/12). Let's call this equation (y).

Now, from equation (xy), we have x y = 2^(-2/3). But y is x * 2^(-1/12), so substitute that in:

x * (x * 2^(-1/12)) = 2^(-2/3)

Simplify:

x^2 * 2^(-1/12) = 2^(-2/3)

Multiply both sides by 2^(1/12):

x^2 = 2^(-2/3) * 2^(1/12) = 2^(-8/12 + 1/12) = 2^(-7/12)

So x^2 = 2^(-7/12). Taking square root:

x = 2^(-7/24). Since x is positive. Let me write that as equation (x).

Now, knowing x, we can find y from equation (y): y = x * 2^(-1/12) = 2^(-7/24) * 2^(-1/12)

Compute exponents: (-7/24) + (-2/24) = (-9/24) = (-3/8). So:

y = 2^(-3/8)

So y = 2^(-3/8). Let's note this as equation (y).

Now, let me recap:

x = 2^(-7/24)

y = 2^(-3/8)

z = 2^(-5/12)

Let me convert all exponents to have the same denominator to make it easier. Let's see, 24 is a common denominator.

x = 2^(-7/24)

y = 2^(-9/24) because (-3/8) is (-9/24)

z = 2^(-10/24) because (-5/12) is (-10/24)

Wait, let me check that:

-3/8 is equal to -9/24, yes.

-5/12 is equal to -10/24, correct.

So x = 2^(-7/24), y = 2^(-9/24), z = 2^(-10/24)

Hmm, so now, I need to compute log₂(x^4 y^3 z^2). Let me write that expression:

log₂(x^4 y^3 z^2) = log₂( (x^4) * (y^3) * (z^2) )

Using logarithm properties, log_b(a*b*c) = log_b(a) + log_b(b) + log_b(c). So:

= log₂(x^4) + log₂(y^3) + log₂(z^2)

= 4 log₂(x) + 3 log₂(y) + 2 log₂(z)

Now, since x = 2^(-7/24), log₂(x) = -7/24.

Similarly, y = 2^(-9/24), so log₂(y) = -9/24 = -3/8.

And z = 2^(-10/24) = 2^(-5/12), so log₂(z) = -5/12.

So substitute these into the expression:

= 4*(-7/24) + 3*(-3/8) + 2*(-5/12)

Let me compute each term:

First term: 4*(-7/24) = (-28)/24 = (-7)/6

Second term: 3*(-3/8) = (-9)/8

Third term: 2*(-5/12) = (-10)/12 = (-5)/6

So adding them together:

(-7/6) + (-9/8) + (-5/6)

Let me convert all to 24 denominators to add them:

-7/6 = (-28)/24

-9/8 = (-27)/24

-5/6 = (-20)/24

Adding them:

(-28 -27 -20)/24 = (-75)/24

Simplify: -75/24. Let's see if this reduces.

Divide numerator and denominator by 3: (-25)/8.

So log₂(x^4 y^3 z^2) = (-25)/8.

But the problem says to take the absolute value, so |log₂(x^4 y^3 z^2)| = | -25/8 | = 25/8.

So m = 25, n = 8. They are coprime, so m + n = 25 + 8 = 33.

Wait a second, let me double-check my computations because that seems straightforward. But did I make any mistakes in the exponents?

Let me go back through the steps.

First, from the first equation, x = y z sqrt(2). Then in equation (2a), y = x z 2^(1/3). Substituting that into x's equation:

x = (x z 2^(1/3)) * z * sqrt(2) = x z^2 * 2^(1/3 + 1/2) = x z^2 * 2^(5/6)

So 1 = z^2 * 2^(5/6) => z^2 = 2^(-5/6) => z = 2^(-5/12). That seems correct.

Then equation (3a): z = x y 2^(1/4). So 2^(-5/12) = x y 2^(1/4). Thus, x y = 2^(-5/12 - 3/12) = 2^(-8/12) = 2^(-2/3). Correct.

Then from equation (2a): y = x z 2^(1/3). Since z = 2^(-5/12), so y = x * 2^(-5/12) * 2^(1/3) = x * 2^(-5/12 + 4/12) = x * 2^(-1/12). Correct.

Then, since x y = 2^(-2/3) and y = x 2^(-1/12), substituting:

x * (x 2^(-1/12)) = 2^(-2/3) => x^2 2^(-1/12) = 2^(-2/3)

Multiply both sides by 2^(1/12): x^2 = 2^(-2/3 + 1/12) = 2^(-8/12 + 1/12) = 2^(-7/12). Correct.

Thus, x = 2^(-7/24). Then y = x * 2^(-1/12) = 2^(-7/24 - 2/24) = 2^(-9/24) = 2^(-3/8). Correct.

z is 2^(-5/12) = 2^(-10/24). So exponents are correct.

Now, calculating log₂(x^4 y^3 z^2) = 4 log₂(x) + 3 log₂(y) + 2 log₂(z).

log₂(x) = -7/24, so 4*(-7/24) = (-28)/24 = (-7)/6.

log₂(y) = -9/24 = -3/8, so 3*(-3/8) = (-9)/8.

log₂(z) = -10/24 = -5/12, so 2*(-5/12) = (-10)/12 = (-5)/6.

Adding them:

(-7/6) + (-9/8) + (-5/6). Let me compute this again.

First, combine (-7/6) and (-5/6): (-7 -5)/6 = (-12)/6 = (-2). Then add (-9/8): (-2) + (-9/8) = (-16/8 -9/8) = (-25)/8.

So yes, log₂(...) is (-25)/8, absolute value is 25/8, so m + n = 33.

I think this is correct. But let me check if I made any arithmetic errors, especially with exponents.

Wait, when I calculated 2^(1/3) * 2^(1/2), that's 2^(1/3 + 1/2) = 2^(5/6), correct. Then z squared is 2^(-5/6), so z is 2^(-5/12). Correct.

In the equation (xy) calculation, 2^(-5/12) divided by 2^(1/4) is 2^(-5/12 - 3/12) = 2^(-8/12) = 2^(-2/3). Correct.

Equation (y) is 2^(-1/12), correct.

Then solving for x: x^2 = 2^(-7/12), so x = 2^(-7/24). Correct.

Then y = 2^(-3/8) which is 2^(-9/24), yes.

z is 2^(-5/12) which is 2^(-10/24), correct.

So when computing the log₂, each term is correct:

4*(-7/24) = -7/6,

3*(-3/8) = -9/8,

2*(-5/12) = -5/6.

Adding them:

-7/6 -9/8 -5/6.

Let me compute step by step.

First, -7/6 -5/6 = (-12)/6 = -2.

Then, -2 -9/8.

Convert -2 to eighths: -16/8 -9/8 = (-25)/8. Correct.

So yes, the absolute value is 25/8. So m=25, n=8, which are coprime, so m +n=33.

I'm confident now that the answer is 33.


Given the system of logarithmic equations:

\[
\log_2\left(\frac{x}{yz}\right) = \frac{1}{2}, \quad \log_2\left(\frac{y}{xz}\right) = \frac{1}{3}, \quad \log_2\left(\frac{z}{xy}\right) = \frac{1}{4},
\]

we convert each equation to exponential form:

1. \(\sqrt{2} = \frac{x}{yz} \implies x = yz \sqrt{2}\),
2. \(2^{1/3} = \frac{y}{xz} \implies y = xz \cdot 2^{1/3}\),
3. \(2^{1/4} = \frac{z}{xy} \implies z = xy \cdot 2^{1/4}\).

Substituting \(y = xz \cdot 2^{1/3}\) into \(x = yz \sqrt{2}\):

\[
x = (xz \cdot 2^{1/3})z \sqrt{2} = xz^2 \cdot 2^{5/6}.
\]

Solving for \(z^2\):

\[
z^2 = 2^{-5/6} \implies z = 2^{-5/12}.
\]

Using \(z = 2^{-5/12}\) in \(z = xy \cdot 2^{1/4}\):

\[
2^{-5/12} = xy \cdot 2^{1/4} \implies xy = 2^{-2/3}.
\]

Substituting \(z = 2^{-5/12}\) into \(y = xz \cdot 2^{1/3}\):

\[
y = x \cdot 2^{-5/12} \cdot 2^{1/3} = x \cdot 2^{-1/12}.
\]

Using \(xy = 2^{-2/3}\) and \(y = x \cdot 2^{-1/12}\):

\[
x^2 \cdot 2^{-1/12} = 2^{-2/3} \implies x^2 = 2^{-7/12} \implies x = 2^{-7/24}.
\]

Thus, \(y = 2^{-3/8}\) and \(z = 2^{-5/12}\).

Now, compute \(\log_2(x^4 y^3 z^2)\):

\[
\log_2(x^4 y^3 z^2) = 4\log_2(x) + 3\log_2(y) + 2\log_2(z).
\]

Substituting the values:

\[
4(-7/24) + 3(-3/8) + 2(-5/12) = -7/6 - 9/8 - 5/6 = -25/8.
\]

Taking the absolute value:

\[
\left|\log_2(x^4 y^3 z^2)\right| = 25/8.
\]

Thus, \(m = 25\) and \(n = 8\), giving \(m + n = 33\).

\boxed{33}
