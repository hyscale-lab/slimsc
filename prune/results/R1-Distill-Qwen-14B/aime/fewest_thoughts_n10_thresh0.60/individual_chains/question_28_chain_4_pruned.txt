Alright, so I've got this tetrahedron problem. Let me try to visualize it first. The tetrahedron is labeled ABCD, and it has some specific edge lengths. The edges AB and CD are both sqrt(41), AC and BD are sqrt(80), and BC and AD are sqrt(89). Interesting, so it seems like opposite edges are equal. That might mean the tetrahedron has some symmetry.

The question is about finding a point I inside the tetrahedron such that the distances from I to each of the four faces are all equal. That point is called the incenter, I think? In a tetrahedron, the incenter is the center of the inscribed sphere that touches all the faces. So, the distance from I to each face is the radius of this inscribed sphere.

The formula for the radius of the inscribed sphere in a tetrahedron is, I believe, related to the volume and the surface area. For a tetrahedron, the inradius r is equal to 3 times the volume divided by the total surface area. So, r = 3V / A_total, where V is the volume and A_total is the sum of the areas of the four faces.

So, to find r, I need to find the volume of the tetrahedron and the total surface area. But first, I need to figure out the volume. Hmm, computing the volume of a tetrahedron with these edge lengths might be tricky because I don't have any right angles or obvious coordinates.

Wait, maybe I can model this tetrahedron in 3D space. If I can assign coordinates to the vertices A, B, C, D such that all the given edge lengths are satisfied, then I can compute the volume using the scalar triple product.

Let me try assigning coordinates. Let me place point A at the origin, so A = (0, 0, 0). Then, let me assign point B somewhere on the x-axis, so B = (x, 0, 0). Point C can be in the xy-plane, so C = (a, b, 0). Point D will be somewhere in 3D space, so D = (p, q, r).

Now, I need to ensure that all the given edge lengths are satisfied.

Given:
AB = sqrt(41): So the distance between A and B is sqrt(
