Alright, so I've got this problem with logarithms and three variables, x, y, and z. It's a system of equations, and I need to find the absolute value of log base 2 of x^4 y^3 z^2. Then, express that as a fraction m/n where m and n are coprime, and find m + n. Hmm, okay, let's break this down.

The equations given are:

1. log₂(x / (y z)) = 1/2
2. log₂(y / (x z)) = 1/3
3. log₂(z / (x y)) = 1/4

So, all of these are logarithms base 2. Since logarithms can be tricky, maybe I can rewrite each equation in exponential form to make it simpler. Remember, log_b(a) = c is equivalent to b^c = a.

Let's rewrite each equation:

1. 2^(1/2) = x / (y z)
2. 2^(1/3) = y / (x z)
3. 2^(1/4) = z / (x y)

Simplify the exponents:

1. sqrt(2) = x / (y z) → equation (1)
2. 2^(1/3) = y / (x z) → equation (2)
3. 2^(1/4) = z / (x y) → equation (3)

Hmm, now I have three equations with variables in the numerator and denominator. Maybe I can express x, y, z in terms of each other. Let me see.

From equation (1): x = sqrt(2) * y z.

From equation (2): y = 2^(1/3) * x z.

From equation (3): z = 2^(1/4) * x y.

Hmm, substituting might get messy, but let's try to express everything in terms of one variable. Let's see if I can substitute x from equation (1) into equation (2), then into equation (3).

From equation (1), x = sqrt(2) y z. Let's plug this into equation (2):

y = 2^(1/3) * (sqrt(2) y z) * z = 2^(1/3) * sqrt(2) * y z^2.

Wait, so y = [2^(1/3) * 2^(1/2)] y z^2.

Simplify the exponents: 2^(1/3 + 1/2) = 2^(5/6). So,

y = 2^(5/6) y z^2.

Hmm, I can divide both sides by y (since y is positive, so it's not zero):

1 = 2^(5/6) z^2.

So, z^2 = 1 / 2^(5/6) = 2^(-5/6).

Taking square roots:

z = 2^(-5/12). Because sqrt(2^(-5/6)) = 2^(-5/12). Since z is positive, we take the positive root.

Okay, so z is 2^(-5/12). Let me note that down.

Now, let's go back to equation (1): x = sqrt(2) * y z.

We have z = 2^(-5/12), so let's plug that in:

x = 2^(1/2) * y * 2^(-5/12) = y * 2^(1/2 - 5/12).

Compute the exponent: 1/2 is 6/12, so 6/12 -5/12 = 1/12.

So, x = y * 2^(1/12). So, x = y * 2^(1/12). Let's keep that in mind.

Now, let's go to equation (2): y = 2^(1/3) * x z.

We already have x in terms of y, so substitute x:

y = 2^(1/3) * (y * 2^(1/12)) * z.

We also know z is 2^(-5/12), so plug that in:

y = 2^(1/3) * y * 2^(1/12) * 2^(-5/12).

Combine the exponents:

2^(1/3) * 2^(1/12 -5/12) = 2^(1/3) * 2^(-4/12) = 2^(1/3) * 2^(-1/3) = 2^(0) = 1.

So, y = 1 * y → y = y.

Wait, that just gives an identity. Hmm, that doesn't help me find y. Maybe I need to use equation (3) now.

From equation (3): z = 2^(1/4) * x y.

We know z = 2^(-5/12), so:

2^(-5/12) = 2^(1/4) * x y.

We also know x = y * 2^(1/12), so substitute that:

2^(-5/12) = 2^(1/4) * (y * 2^(1/12)) * y = 2^(1/4) * y^2 * 2^(1/12).

Combine the exponents for 2:

2^(1/4 + 1/12) = 2^(3/12 + 1/12) = 2^(4/12) = 2^(1/3).

So, 2^(-5/12) = 2^(1/3) * y^2.

Divide both sides by 2^(1/3):

y^2 = 2^(-5/12 - 1/3) = 2^(-5/12 -4/12) = 2^(-9/12) = 2^(-3/4).

Take square roots:

y = 2^(-3/8). Again, positive root because y is positive.

So, y is 2^(-3/8).

Now, from earlier, x = y * 2^(1/12). Plugging in y:

x = 2^(-3/8) * 2^(1/12) = 2^(-3/8 + 1/12).

Find a common denominator for the exponents, which is 24:

-3/8 = -9/24

1/12 = 2/24

So, exponent is (-9 + 2)/24 = (-7)/24.

Thus, x = 2^(-7/24).

So now we have all variables expressed in powers of 2:

x = 2^(-7/24),

y = 2^(-3/8),

z = 2^(-5/12).

Let me write them down with exponents over 24 to make it easier:

x = 2^(-7/24),

y = 2^(-9/24),

z = 2^(-10/24).

Wait, let's see:

-3/8 is equal to -9/24,

-5/12 is equal to -10/24.

Yes, so:

x = 2^(-7/24),

y = 2^(-9/24),

z = 2^(-10/24).

Okay, now we need to find |log₂(x^4 y^3 z^2)|.

Let me compute x^4 y^3 z^2.

First, compute each term:

x^4 = (2^(-7/24))^4 = 2^(-28/24) = 2^(-7/6).

y^3 = (2^(-9/24))^3 = 2^(-27/24) = 2^(-9/8).

z^2 = (2^(-10/24))^2 = 2^(-20/24) = 2^(-5/6).

Now, multiply them all together:

x^4 y^3 z^2 = 2^(-7/6) * 2^(-9/8) * 2^(-5/6).

Add exponents:

-7/6 - 9/8 -5/6.

Let me find a common denominator, which is 24.

Convert each fraction:

-7/6 = -28/24,

-9/8 = -27/24,

-5/6 = -20/24.

Adding them together: (-28 -27 -20)/24 = (-75)/24 = -25/8.

So, x^4 y^3 z^2 = 2^(-25/8).

Then, log₂(x^4 y^3 z^2) = log₂(2^(-25/8)) = -25/8.

Taking the absolute value: | -25/8 | = 25/8.

So, the value is 25/8. Therefore, m =25, n=8. They are coprime since 25 and 8 share no common factors besides 1.

Thus, m +n= 25 +8=33.


The system of logarithmic equations is transformed into exponential form to express \(x\), \(y\), and \(z\) in terms of powers of 2. Solving the system yields \(x = 2^{-7/24}\), \(y = 2^{-3/8}\), and \(z = 2^{-5/12}\). Substituting these into \(x^4 y^3 z^2\) results in \(2^{-25/8}\). Taking the logarithm base 2 gives \(-25/8\), and the absolute value is \(25/8\). Thus, \(m + n = 25 + 8 = 33\).

\[
\boxed{33}
