Okay, so I have this geometry problem to solve. Let me try to parse it step by step.

We have three points: O at (0,0), A at (1/2, 0), and B at (0, sqrt(3)/2). So, O is the origin, A is on the x-axis halfway between O and (1,0), and B is on the y-axis at a point such that the y-coordinate is sqrt(3)/2, which is approximately 0.866.

Next, the family F consists of segments PQ of unit length where P is on the x-axis, Q is on the y-axis, and the segment PQ lies in the first quadrant. So, these are all line segments of length 1 that connect a point on the x-axis to a point on the y-axis, staying in the first quadrant.

The problem states that there's a unique point C on segment AB, different from A and B, that doesn't lie on any other segment from F except for AB itself. Then, we need to find OC², which will be a fraction p/q, and then compute p + q.

Hmm. So, the key here is to find this point C on AB that isn't on any other PQ from F. So, essentially, C is a point on AB that is only on AB among all these PQ segments. So, perhaps AB is the only segment from F that passes through C.

So, first, I should parametrize AB. Let me find the equation of line AB.

Point A is (1/2, 0), and point B is (0, sqrt(3)/2). So, the slope of AB is (sqrt(3)/2 - 0)/(0 - 1/2) = (sqrt(3)/2) / (-1/2) = -sqrt(3). Therefore, the equation of AB is y = -sqrt(3)(x - 1/2), since it passes through A.

Simplifying that equation: y = -sqrt(3)x + sqrt(3)/2.

So, any point C on AB can be written as (x, -sqrt(3)x + sqrt(3)/2), where x ranges from 0 to 1/2.

Now, the family F consists of segments PQ, each of length 1, with P on x-axis, Q on y-axis, in the first quadrant.

So, suppose a general segment PQ is from (a, 0) to (0, b), where a and b are positive real numbers, and the distance between (a,0) and (0,b) is 1. So, sqrt(a² + b²) = 1. Therefore, a² + b² = 1.

Thus, for any such segment PQ, the equation is from (a,0) to (0,b) with a² + b² =1.

Now, the equation of line PQ can be found. The line connecting (a,0) and (0,b) in intercept form is x/a + y/b = 1.

We can parametrize this line as x = a*t, y = b*(1 - t), where t ranges from 0 to 1.

Alternatively, the equation can be written as y = (-b/a)x + b.

Now, our point C is on AB, so it lies on y = -sqrt(3)x + sqrt(3)/2.

We need to find a point C such that it lies on AB and on exactly one PQ from F, which is AB itself. So, for all other PQ segments from F, C shouldn't lie on them.

Therefore, the condition is that C must lie on AB and on some PQ from F, but for no other PQ in F does C lie on it.

So, the point C is the intersection point of AB and some PQ in F, but it's the only such PQ that passes through C.

So, to find C, we can find the intersection of AB and PQ, and then ensure that this is the only intersection point with any PQ in F.

Wait, but perhaps more carefully: For point C on AB, we need that it is not on any other PQ from F except AB itself. So, when we look at all PQ segments in F, only AB passes through C.

So, to find such a point, perhaps it's the point where AB is tangent to the envelope of all such PQ segments.

Wait, that might be an avenue. The envelope of a family of curves is a curve that is tangent to each member of the family at some
