Okay, so Alice and Bob are playing this game where they take turns removing either 1 or 4 tokens from a stack of n tokens. Alice goes first, and the person who takes the last token wins. I need to find how many positive integers n ≤ 2024 where Bob can always win, no matter how Alice plays.

Hmm, let me think. This seems like a combinatorial game theory problem. I remember these involve determining winning and losing positions. A winning position is one where the current player can force a win, and a losing position is where no matter what the current player does, the opponent can force a win.

So, in this game, each player can remove 1 or 4 tokens on their turn. The last token wins. So, if there's 1 token left and it's your turn, you take it and win. Similarly, if there are 4 tokens, you can take all and win.

Wait, so perhaps I should model this with dynamic programming, determining for each number of tokens whether it's a winning (W) or losing position (L). Let's start from small n and see if I can find a pattern.

n=1: Alice takes 1, wins. So Bob can't do anything. So Bob can't win here. So n=1 is a W position.

n=2: Alice can take 1, leaving 1 for Bob. Then Bob takes 1 and wins. Wait, no, because Alice is first. Let me think. If Alice takes 1, it's Bob's turn with n=1. Bob takes 1 and wins. So Alice will not let that happen. Alternatively, can Alice take 4? No, because n=2, she can't take 4. So Alice's only move is to take 1, leaving 1 for Bob, who then takes it and wins. So n=2 is a losing position for Alice, which means it's a winning position for Bob. Wait, no. Let me clarify. In this case, n=2 is a position where the current player is Alice. She has to take 1, leaving 1 for Bob, who then takes it and wins. So Alice cannot win from n=2, so n=2 is a losing position for Alice, which would mean it's a winning position for Bob. Wait, no, because the position itself is n=2, and it's the current player's turn—Alice. If Alice can't force a win, then n=2 is a losing position for the current player (Alice), so Bob would win if it's his turn. Wait, maybe I'm confusing whose turn it is.

Wait, perhaps I should define the positions without considering whose turn it is. So positions are either winning (N-position) or losing (P-position). An N-position is where the Next player can win, and a P-position is where the Previous player can force a win, meaning the current player will lose if the opponent plays optimally.

So for n=1: it's a P-position because the current player can take the last token and win. Wait, no, if it's your turn and n=1, you can take it and win, so that's an N-position. Wait, maybe I have the definitions reversed.

Wait, according to standard definitions, in combinatorial game theory, P-position means the previous player can force a win (i.e., the current player is in a losing position), and N-position means the next player can force a win (current player is in a winning position). So, if the current player is faced with a P-position, it means the previous player can force a win, so the current player cannot. So perhaps I should build this from the bottom up.

Let me list n from 0 upwards:

n=0: No tokens. The game is over. So the player who just moved wins. So n=0 is a losing position for the current player (since they can't move). So n=0 is a P-position.

n=1: The current player can take 1 and win. So it's an N-position.

n=2: The current player can take 1, leaving n=1 for the opponent, which is an N-position. So the opponent can then win. Alternatively, the current player could take 4, but since n=2 <4, that's not possible. So the current player's only move is to n=1 (N). So if the current player moves to an N-position, that means the next player can win. So n=2 is a P-position. Because any move the current player makes leads to the opponent being in a winning position.

Wait, no. Wait, n=2: current player can take 1, leaving n=1 for the opponent, which is an N-position. So the opponent can win from n=1. So the original player (at n=2) can force the next player into a winning position, which would mean the original player can win, but that contradicts. Wait, no. Wait, perhaps I'm getting this wrong.

Wait, let me think again. An N-position is when the Next player can win. So, for n=1, the next player (current player) can take 1 and win, so it's an N-position. For n=2, the current player can take 1, leaving n=1 for the opponent, who is then in an N-position and can win. So the current player can't force a win, so n=2 is a P-position.

Wait, no, that doesn't make sense. Because if the current player at n=2 takes 1, opponent is at n=1, which is N. Opponent can win immediately. So the current player can't force a win, so n=2 is a P-position.

n=3: current player can take 1, leaving n=2 (P-position). So the opponent is now at a P-position, which is a losing position for them. So the current player can force the opponent into a losing position, so n=3 is an N-position.

n=4: current player can take 4 and win. So n=4 is an N-position.

n=5: current player can take 1, leaving n=4 (N-position), or take 4, leaving n=1 (N-position). So both options leave the opponent in N-positions, where they can win. So the current player can't force a win, so n=5 is a P-position.

Wait, that doesn't make sense. Wait, if the current player takes 1, opponent is at n=4, which is an N-position, meaning opponent can win. So current player can't force a win. So n=5 is a P-position.

n=6: current player can take 1, leaving n=5 (P), or take 4, leaving n=2 (P). Wait, if current player takes 1, opponent is at n=5 (P), which is a losing position for the opponent, so current player can win by moving to a P-position. So n=6 is an N-position.

Wait, no. Wait, the current player can take 1, moving to n=5 (P), which is a losing position for the opponent, so the current player can force a win. So n=6 is an N-position.

n=7: current player can take 1, leaving n=6 (N), or take 4, leaving n=3 (N). So both options leave the opponent in N-positions, where they can win. So the current player can't force a win, so n=7 is a P-position.

n=8: current player can take 1, leaving n=7 (P), which is a losing position for the opponent. So the current player can win by taking 1. So n=8 is an N-position.

Wait, let me make a table to keep track.

Let me tabulate n from 0 to, say, 10:

n | Position (P or N)
0 | P
1 | N
2 | P
3 | N
4 | N
5 | P
6 | N
7 | P
8 | N
9 | N
10| ?

Wait, let's compute up to n=10.

n=0: P (base case)

n=1: can take 1 to 0 (P), so current player wins. N.

n=2: can take 1 to 1 (N). So opponent can win. So current player can't force a win. P.

n=3: can take 1 to 2 (P). Opponent is in P, so current player can win. N.

n=4: can take 4 to 0 (P). So current player wins. N.

n=5: can take 1 to 4 (N) or 4 to 1 (N). Both moves leave opponent in N. So current player can't win. P.

n=6: can take 1 to 5 (P) or 4 to 2 (P). So current player can move to P, making opponent lose. So N.

n=7: can take 1 to 6 (N) or 4 to 3 (N). Both moves leave opponent in N. So current player can't force a win. P.

n=8: can take 1 to 7 (P) or 4 to 4 (N). So taking 1 to 7 is P, which means opponent can't win. So current player can win by taking 1. So N.

n=9: can take 1 to 8 (N) or 4 to 5 (P). So taking 4 to 5 (P), opponent is in losing position. So current player can win. N.

n=10: can take 1 to 9 (N) or 4 to 6 (N). Both options leave opponent in N. So current player can't force a win. P.

Hmm, so the pattern so far is:

n : 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10
pos:P N P N N P N P N N P

Wait, maybe I can spot a pattern here. Let me list the positions:

P at: 0,2,5,7,10

N at:1,3,4,6,8,9

Wait, the P positions are at n=0,2,5,7,10.

Looking at the differences between these:

2-0=2

5-2=3

7-5=2

10-7=3

So the pattern is adding 2 and 3 alternately. So starting at 0, add 2 to get 2, add 3 to get 5, add 2 to get7, add 3 to get10, then next would be 12 (add 2), then 15 (add 3), and so on.

So the P positions are numbers congruent to 0 mod 5? No, wait 0,2,5,7,10,12,15,... Let me see modulo 5:

0 mod5=0

2 mod5=2

5 mod5=0

7 mod5=2

10 mod5=0

12 mod5=2

15 mod5=0

So the P positions are numbers congruent to 0 or 2 mod5. Wait, let's check n=5:5 mod5=0, which is P.

n=2:2 mod5=2, which is P.

n=7:7 mod5=2, P.

n=10:10 mod5=0, P.

n=12:12 mod5=2, P.

n=15:15 mod5=0, P.

So the P positions are numbers that are 0 or 2 mod5. So n ≡0 or 2 mod5 are losing positions for the current player.

Wait, let's check n=5: yes, P. n=7: yes, P. n=10: yes, P. n=12: yes.

So, if this pattern holds, then for any n ≡0 or 2 mod5, it's a P-position. Otherwise, it's an N-position.

So, if the starting n is a P-position, then the current player (Alice) will lose if Bob plays optimally. Because Bob can always move to another P-position, forcing Alice into a losing position each time.

So, the question is, how many n ≤2024 where n ≡0 or 2 mod5. Because those are the positions where Bob can win if he's the second player.

Wait, wait. Wait. If the game starts at n, and n is a P-position, then the current player (Alice) cannot force a win, meaning Bob can win. So the count is the number of n ≤2024 where n ≡0 or 2 mod5.

So, let's compute how many numbers ≤2024 are congruent to 0 mod5, and how many are congruent to 2 mod5.

Total numbers = count_0 + count_2.

Compute count_0: floor(2024/5) = 404 (since 5*404=2020, and 2024-2020=4, so 404 numbers.

But wait, 2024 /5 is 404.8, so floor is 404. So numbers are 5,10,15,...,2020. So 404 numbers.

Similarly, numbers congruent to 2 mod5: starting from 2,7,12,... up to ≤2024.

What's the largest number ≤2024 that is 2 mod5? Let's see:

2024 divided by5 is 404 with remainder 4. So 5*404=2020. 2020+2=2022. 2022 mod5 is 2020+2=2022, which is 2 mod5. So the last term is 2022.

So the sequence is 2,7,12,...,2022.

Number of terms: Let's compute (2022 -2)/5 +1 = (2020)/5 +1=404 +1=405.

So count_0 is 404, count_2 is 405.

Total P-positions: 404 +405=809.

Wait, but wait. Let me double-check.

Wait, count_0 is the number of multiples of 5 up to 2024.

The largest multiple of5 ≤2024 is 2020, which is 5*404. So 404 numbers.

count_2: numbers ≡2 mod5.

The first is 2, the last is 2022=5*404 +2=2020+2=2022.

Number of terms: ((2022 -2)/5) +1= (2020/5)+1=404 +1=405.

So total P-positions:404+405=809.

So the answer is 809.

Wait, but let me make sure that the initial analysis is correct. Because sometimes when you have multiple move options, the pattern might not hold beyond a certain point.

Wait, earlier I saw that for n=5, it's a P-position, and for n=10, it's a P-position. Let me check n=5.

n=5: Alice can take 1, leaving 4, which is N. Bob can then take 4 and win. Or Alice can take 4, leaving 1, which is N, Bob takes 1 and wins. So Alice can't win from n=5, so it's P, correct.

n=6: Alice can take 1, leaving 5 (P), which is a losing position for Bob. So Alice can win by moving to P, so n=6 is N, correct.

n=7: Alice can take 1, leaving 6 (N), or 4, leaving 3 (N). Either way, Bob can win from N, so n=7 is P, correct.

n=8: Alice can take1, leaving7 (P), so Bob is in a losing position. So Alice can win, so n=8 is N.

n=9: Alice can take4, leaving5 (P), so Bob can't win. So n=9 is N.

n=10: Alice can take1, leaving9 (N), or take4, leaving6 (N). Both options leave Bob in N positions, so Bob can win. So n=10 is P, correct.

So the pattern holds up to n=10. So it's likely correct.

Thus, the number of n ≤2024 where n≡0 or 2 mod5 is 809.


To determine how many positive integers \( n \leq 2024 \) allow Bob to guarantee a win, we analyze the game using combinatorial game theory. The key is to identify positions (values of \( n \)) where the current player cannot force a win, known as losing positions or \( P \)-positions.

### Game Rules:
- Players take turns removing either 1 or 4 tokens.
- The player who removes the last token wins.
- Alice goes first.

### Identifying \( P \)-Positions:
We start by examining small values of \( n \) and classifying them as winning (\( N \)-positions) or losing (\( P \)-positions):

- \( n = 0 \): \( P \) (game ends, no move possible)
- \( n = 1 \): \( N \) (take 1 token to win)
- \( n = 2 \): \( P \) (taking 1 token leaves \( n = 1 \), which is \( N \))
- \( n = 3 \): \( N \) (take 1 token, leaving \( n = 2 \), which is \( P \))
- \( n = 4 \): \( N \) (take 4 tokens to win)
- \( n = 5 \): \( P \) (taking 1 or 4 tokens leaves \( n = 4 \) or \( n = 1 \), both \( N \))
- \( n = 6 \): \( N \) (take 1 token, leaving \( n = 5 \), which is \( P \))
- \( n = 7 \): \( P \) (taking 1 or 4 tokens leaves \( n = 6 \) or \( n = 3 \), both \( N \))
- \( n = 8 \): \( N \) (take 1 token, leaving \( n = 7 \), which is \( P \))
- \( n = 9 \): \( N \) (take 4 tokens, leaving \( n = 5 \), which is \( P \))
- \( n = 10 \): \( P \) (taking 1 or 4 tokens leaves \( n = 9 \) or \( n = 6 \), both \( N \))

From this, we observe that \( P \)-positions occur at \( n \equiv 0 \) or \( 2 \mod 5 \). This pattern continues for all \( n \).

### Counting \( P \)-Positions ≤ 2024:
We need to count numbers \( n \leq 2024 \) where \( n \equiv 0 \) or \( 2 \mod 5 \).

1. **Numbers ≡ 0 mod 5**:
   - The sequence is \( 5, 10, 15, \ldots, 2020 \).
   - Number of terms: \( \left\lfloor \frac{2024}{5} \right\rfloor = 404 \).

2. **Numbers ≡ 2 mod 5**:
   - The sequence is \( 2, 7, 12, \ldots, 2022 \).
   - Number of terms: \( \left\lfloor \frac{2024 - 2}{5} \right\rfloor + 1 = 405 \).

Adding these, the total number of \( P \)-positions is \( 404 + 405 = 809 \).

### Final Answer:
The number of positive integers \( n \leq 2024 \) where Bob can guarantee a win is:

\[
\boxed{809}
\]
