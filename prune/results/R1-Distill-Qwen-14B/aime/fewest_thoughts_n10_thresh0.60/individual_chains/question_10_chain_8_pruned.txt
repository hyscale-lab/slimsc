Okay, so I've got this problem here where Alice chooses a set A of positive integers. Then Bob lists all finite nonempty sets B of positive integers such that the maximum element of B is in A. It turns out Bob's list has 2024 sets. I need to find the sum of the elements of A.

Hmm, let's try to break this down. First, Alice picks set A. Bob then considers all possible finite nonempty sets B where each B has its maximum element in A. The total number of such B's is 2024.

Wait, so for each element in A, say a, the number of finite nonempty sets B where max(B) = a. How do we count those?

If the maximum element is a, then all other elements in B must be less than a. Also, B has to be a nonempty set, which implies it has at least one element. So for a given a, how many such sets B are there?

I remember that for a given maximum element a, the number of possible sets B is equal to the number of subsets of {1, 2, ..., a-1}, including the empty set, and then subtracting 1 because B must be nonempty. Wait, no, wait. Let me think.

If the maximum is a, then all elements in B are from {1, 2, ..., a}, and the set must include a. So the other elements can be any subset of {1, 2, ..., a-1}. But since B must be nonempty, and it must include a, the number of such sets is equal to the number of subsets of {1, 2, ..., a-1}, including the empty set, because each subset combined with {a} gives a valid B.

So the number of B's with max a is 2^{a-1}. Because each element in {1, 2, ..., a-1} can be either included or not. So that's 2^{a-1} subsets.

So if A has elements {a1, a2, ..., an}, then the total number of B's is the sum over each a in A of 2^{a-1}.

In the problem, Bob's list has 2024 sets, so sum_{a in A
