Okay, so I have this geometry problem here about triangle ABC. It says that the circumcenter is O and the incenter is I. They tell me that IA is perpendicular to OI. The circumradius is 13, and the inradius is 6. I need to find the product AB times AC.

Hmm, let's start by recalling some properties of circumcenters and incenters. The circumradius R is 13, so that's the radius of the circumscribed circle around triangle ABC. The inradius r is 6, which is the radius of the inscribed circle.

I remember that in any triangle, the distance between the incenter I and the circumcenter O is given by the formula:

OI = sqrt(R(R - 2r))

Wait, let me make sure I remember that correctly. I think it's OI² = R² - 2Rr, which would give OI = sqrt(R² - 2Rr). Let me plug in the given values:

R is 13, r is 6, so OI² = 13² - 2*13*6 = 169 - 156 = 13. So OI is sqrt(13). That's useful.

Now, the problem states that IA is perpendicular to OI. So IA ⊥ OI, which means the vectors IA and OI are perpendicular, so their dot product is zero. But maybe I can use coordinate geometry here. Maybe placing the triangle in a coordinate system would help.

Let me place point I at the origin (0,0) to make things simpler. Then, since OI is a vector, and IA is perpendicular to OI, if I can find coordinates for O and A, I can use the perpendicularity condition.

Wait, but O is the circumcenter. Hmm, if I is at (0,0), then O is at some point (h, k). The distance between O and I is sqrt(h² + k²) = sqrt(13), so h² + k² = 13.

Point A is somewhere on the plane. The vector IA would be from I(0,0) to A(x, y), which is (x, y). The vector OI is from O(h, k) to I(0,0), which is (-h, -k). Wait, but wait, IA is the vector from I to A, which is (x, y). OI is the vector from O to I, which is (-h, -k). But they're saying IA is perpendicular to OI, so their dot product is zero.

So the dot product of IA and OI is (x, y) • (-h, -k) = -h x - k y = 0. So h x + k y = 0.

Hmm, but I don't know the coordinates of A yet. Maybe I can express A in terms of some other variables. Also, since O is the circumradius, the distance from O to A is R, which is 13. So OA = 13, which is sqrt( (x - h)^2 + (y -
