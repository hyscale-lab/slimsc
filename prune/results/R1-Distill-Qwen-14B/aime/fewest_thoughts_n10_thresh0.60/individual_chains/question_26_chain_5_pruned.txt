Okay, so I have this geometry problem here, and I'm trying to figure out how to approach it. Let me read it again.

We have triangle ABC inscribed in a circle ω. The tangents to ω at B and C intersect at point D. Then, the line AD intersects ω again at point P. We're given that AB is 5 units, BC is 9 units, and AC is 10 units. We need to find the length of AP, express it as a fraction m/n where m and n are coprime, and then find m + n.

Hmm, okay. So, first, I think I need to visualize the problem or maybe draw a diagram to understand what's going on. Since I can't draw here, I'll try to imagine it. Triangle ABC with sides AB=5, BC=9, AC=10. The circle ω is the circumcircle of ABC, so all three vertices lie on ω. Then, the tangents at B and C meet at D. So, D is the exsymmedian point? Or maybe the symmedian point? Wait, not exactly sure.

Wait, tangents at B and C intersect at D. So, D is the ex-pole of BC, or something like that. Alternatively, I remember that the point where the two tangents meet is called the symmedian point or perhaps the exsymmedian point. But maybe I'm overcomplicating.

Alternatively, I recall that point D is the exsimilicenter of the circle ω with respect to BC, but maybe that's another concept. I think I need to find some properties related to point D.

Wait, the key here is that D is the intersection of tangents at B and C. So, D lies on the polar of BC with respect to ω. Also, since D is the intersection of two tangents, it's the ex-pole of BC.

Another thought: the polar of point D with respect to ω would be the line BC. Because if you have a point outside the circle, the polar is the line joining the points of tangency, which in this case are B and C. So, yeah, polar of D is BC.

Now, the line AD intersects ω again at P. So, we have point A, which is on ω, and line AD passes through D and intersects ω at A and P. So, P is the second intersection point of line AD with the circumcircle ω.

We need to find AP. So, AP is the length from A to P along the line AD beyond A to P.

Given the sides of the triangle, perhaps I can compute some angles or use power of a point or something like that.

Power of a point might be a good approach here. Let me recall that the power of point D with respect to ω is equal to DB² and DC² because DB and DC are tangent to ω. So, power of D is DB² = DC², which implies DB = DC. Wait, so D lies on the perpendicular bisector of BC.

Hmm, that's interesting. Since DB = DC, triangle DBC is isoceles with DB = DC, so D lies on the perpendicular bisector of BC.

But in the triangle ABC, the circumcircle ω has BC as a chord. The perpendicular bisector of BC would pass through the center of ω. So, point D is somewhere along that perpendicular bisector.

But how does that help me? Maybe I can find the coordinates of D or something.

Alternatively, perhaps using coordinates is a way to go. Let me try to assign coordinates to the triangle ABC to make calculations easier.

Let me place point C at the origin (0,0) for simplicity. Then, point B can be somewhere, and point A can be placed such that AC =10, AB=5, and BC=9.

Wait, if I place C at (0,0), then point B can be at (9,0), but wait, BC is 9, but that might complicate things. Alternatively, maybe I can place point C at (0,0), point B at (x, y), and point A at (p, q). Hmm, but that might get too messy.

Alternatively, perhaps using barycentric coordinates with respect to triangle ABC. But I'm not too familiar with barycentric coordinates, so maybe it's better to try another approach.

Wait, maybe I can use the Law of Cosines to find some angles in triangle ABC. Let's see, in triangle ABC, sides AB=5, BC=9, AC=10.

Wait, so sides: AB=5, BC=9, AC=10. Let me compute the semiperimeter first. s = (5 + 9 + 10)/2 = 24/2 =12.

Then, using Heron's formula, the area of triangle ABC is sqrt[s(s - AB)(s - BC)(s - AC)].

So, area = sqrt[12*(1
