Okay, so I've got this math problem here about Aya's morning walks. Let me try to parse it out step by step. 

So, every morning, Aya walks 9 kilometers. She stops at a coffee shop after that. The problem gives me two different scenarios about her walking speed and the time it takes, including the time she spends in the coffee shop. I need to find out how long her walk takes when she walks at a speed of s + 1/2 km/h, including the coffee shop time.

Alright, let's break this down. 

First, in the first scenario, she walks at a constant speed of s kilometers per hour. The walk takes her 4 hours, which includes t minutes spent in the coffee shop. Hmm, wait a secondâ€”4 hours is the total time, including t minutes. So that means the time she spends walking is less than 4 hours. Similarly, in the second scenario, when she walks at s+2 km/h, the total time is 2 hours and 24 minutes, which is 2.4 hours, but again including t minutes in the coffee shop.

Wait, maybe I should convert all the times into hours or minutes to make it easier. Let's see.

First scenario:
- Walking speed: s km/h
- Total time: 4 hours, which includes walking time and coffee shop time (t minutes). So, the walking time is 4 hours minus t minutes. But t is in minutes, so I should probably convert everything to hours or everything to minutes. Maybe hours is easier since the speed is in km per hour.

Let me think. t minutes is t/60 hours. So, the walking time is (4 - t/60) hours. 

But wait, she walks 9 km. So, the walking time should be equal to distance divided by speed. That is, 9/s hours. So, I can set up an equation:

9/s = 4 - t/60.

Similarly, in the second scenario:
- Walking speed: s + 2 km/h
- Total time: 2 hours and 24 minutes. Let's convert that to hours. 24 minutes is 24/60 hours, which is 0.4 hours. So, total time is 2.4 hours. So, walking time is 2.4 - t/60 hours.

Again, walking time is distance over speed: 9/(s+2) hours.

So, the equation for the second scenario is:

9/(s+2) = 2.4 - t/60.

Now I have two equations:

1) 9/s = 4 - t/60
2) 9/(s+2) = 2.4 - t/60

Hmm, so I can solve these two equations to find s and t. Then, when she walks at s + 1/2 km/h, I can find the time taken for the walk, including the coffee shop time.

Wait, so I need to find s and t first. Let me write the equations again.

Equation 1: 9/s = 4 - (t/60)
Equation 2: 9/(s+2) = 2.4 - (t/60)

Let me rearrange both equations to express
