Alright, so I'm trying to figure out this game problem where Alice and Bob take turns removing either 1 or 4 tokens from a stack. The person who takes the last token wins. I need to find how many positive integers n â‰¤ 2024 where Bob can guarantee a win, regardless of Alice's moves.

Hmm, okay, let's break this down. It's a turn-based game with two players, so it's probably a combinatorial game. I remember that in such games, positions can be classified as winning or losing positions. A winning position is one where the current player can force a win no matter what the opponent does, and a losing position is the opposite.

So, let's model this. Let's define P(n) as the position when there are n tokens left. If a player can move to a losing position for the opponent, then the current position is a winning one. Conversely, if all possible moves lead to winning positions for the opponent, then the current position is a losing one.

The base case is when n=0. If there are no tokens left, the game is over, so the player who just moved wins. So, n=0 is a losing position because the player can't make a move.

Wait, actually, maybe I should think about it differently. When n=0, the player who is about to move loses because there are no tokens to take. So, n=0 is a losing position for the player whose turn it is.

So, starting from n=1 and moving upwards, let's try to determine for each n whether it's a winning (W) or losing (L) position.

Let's list out the positions from n=0 upwards:

n=0: L (losing position)
n=1: The player can take 1 token and win. So, W.
n=2: The player can take 1 token, leaving n=1 for the opponent, which is a winning position for them. Alternatively, can they take 4? No, because n=2 <4. So, the only move is to n=1, which is W. So, the current player can't force a loss on the opponent. So, n=2 is L? Wait, no. Wait, if you can only move to W positions, then n=2 is L because any move you make gives the opponent a W position.

Wait, but n=1 is W, so n=2 is L because whatever move the player makes, the opponent can win.

Wait, let me re-examine:

n=0: L (no move possible)
n=1: You can take 1, leaving n=0 (L for the opponent), so n=1 is W.
n=2: You can take 1, leaving n=1 (W for opponent), but that's not helpful. Alternatively, can you take 4? No, so the only move is to n=1, which is W. So, opponent is in a winning position. So, current player can't force a win, so n=2 is L.

n=3: You can take 1, leaving n=2 (L for opponent). So, if you take 1, opponent is in L. So, current player can win. So, n=3 is W.

n=4: You can take 1, leaving n=3 (
