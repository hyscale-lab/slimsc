Okay, so Alice and Bob are playing a game with a stack of n tokens. They take turns, Alice goes first. Each turn, a player can remove either 1 or 4 tokens. The person who takes the last token wins. I need to find how many positive integers n â‰¤ 2024 where Bob can guarantee a win, no matter how Alice plays.

Hmm, I remember this is a type of combinatorial game. Maybe I can model the winning and losing positions.

Let me think about the possible moves. If a player is in a position where they can take 1 or 4 tokens, then the next player's options depend on what's left. The key is to find positions (n) where the current player can force a win, regardless of the opponent's moves.

I think I should start by listing the winning (W) and losing (L) positions for small n and see if a pattern emerges.

Let's start with n=0: Well, if there are 0 tokens left, the game is over, so the player who just moved wins. So n=0 is a losing position for the current player because they can't move.

Wait, no. Wait, in the problem statement, the player who removes the last token wins. So if n=0, the previous player has already taken the last token. So when it's your turn and there are 0 tokens, you can't make a move and you lose. So n=0 is a losing position for the current player.

So let's build from that.

n=1: The current player can take 1 token, leaving 0. Then the next player loses. So n=1 is a winning position (W).

n=2: Current player can take 1, leaving n=1 for the next player, which is a W position for them. Wait, but if I leave them in a W position, that means they can win. So that's bad for me. Alternatively, can I take 4? But n=2, I can't take 4. So the only move is to take 1, leaving 1. But n=1 is a winning position for the next player, so n=2 must be losing? Wait, that can't be right.

Wait, no, if I take 1 from n=2, leaving 1, then the next player can take 1 and win. So that's bad for me. So n=2 is a losing position? Or am I getting this wrong?

Wait, maybe I should think recursively. Let me define:

- A position is a winning position (W) if the current player can force a win.
- A position is a losing position (L) if no matter what the current player does, the opponent can force a win.

So for n=0: current player can't move, so it's L.

n=1: current player takes 1, next player gets 0, which is L. So n=1 is W.

n=2: current player can take 1, leaving n=1 (W for opponent), or can't take 4. So opponent gets a W position, which is bad for me. So n=2 is L.

n=3: current player can take 1, leaving n=2, which is L. So if I take 1 from n=3, opponent is left with L, so they can't win. Therefore, n=3 is W.

Wait, wait. Let me be precise.

n=3: taking 1 leads to n=2 (L for opponent). So opponent can't win from n=2. Therefore, n=3 is W.

n=4: current player can take 4, leaving 0, which is L for opponent. So n=4 is W.

n=5: current player can take 1, leaving n=4 (W), or take 4, leaving n=1 (W). Both options leave the opponent in a W position. So n=5 is L.

Wait, is that correct? Because if I take 1, opponent gets n=4, which is W, meaning opponent can win. If I take 4, opponent gets n=1, which is W. So no matter what I do, opponent can win. Therefore,
