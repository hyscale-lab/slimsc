Okay, so I have this math problem here, and I need to find the number of intersections between two graphs. The functions are defined as y = 4g(f(sin(2πx))) and x = 4g(f(cos(3πy))). Hmm, that looks a bit complicated, but let me try to break it down step by step.

First, let's understand the functions f and g. They are defined as f(x) = ||x| - 1/2| and g(x) = ||x| - 1/4|. So these are absolute value functions composed with each other. Maybe I should sketch these functions first to get an idea of what they look like.

Starting with f(x). The inner function is |x|, which is a V-shape with the vertex at (0,0). Then subtracting 1/2: |x| - 1/2. That would shift the graph down by 1/2. So the vertex is now at (0, -1/2). But wait, taking the absolute value of that, so f(x) = ||x| - 1/2|. So when |x| - 1/2 is negative, it becomes its positive counterpart. Let me think about key points.

When |x| >= 1/2, |x| -1/2 is non-negative, so f(x) = |x| -1/2. When |x| < 1/2, |x| -1/2 is negative, so f(x) becomes -( |x| -1/2 ) = 1/2 - |x|. So f(x) is a V-shaped graph that touches (0, 1/2) at x=0, then goes down to (1/2, 0) and mirrors on both sides. So it's like a diamond shape, right? Wait, no, actually, it's two Vs. Because when you take the absolute value again, it flips the negative part.

So, f(x) is a V with vertex at (0, 1/2), going down to (1/2, 0) on both the right and left sides. Hmm, okay. Similarly, g(x) is defined as ||x| - 1/4|. Let's analyze that.

Again, starting with |x|, then subtracting 1/4. So when |x| >= 1/4, |x| -1/4 is non-negative, so g(x) = |x| -1/4. When |x| <1/4, g(x) becomes 1/4 - |x|. So g(x) is similar to f(x) but with a smaller shift. So its vertex is at (0, 1/4), goes down to (1/4, 0), and then up again on both sides.

Now, the functions inside y and x are compositions. Let's look at y first: y = 4g(f(sin(2πx))). So let's break down the composition.

First, sin(2πx). The sine function typically has a range of [-1,1], and sin(2πx) has a period of 1. So it's a sine wave that completes one full cycle from 0 to 1. Then, we apply f to this sine function: f(sin(2πx)).

Given that f(x) is ||x| -1/2|, let's substitute x with sin(2πx). So f(sin(2πx)) = ||sin(2πx)| - 1/2|. Let's think about the range of sin(2πx), which is between -1 and 1. Taking the absolute value, |sin(2πx)| is between 0 and 1. Then, subtracting 1/2 gives us a value between -1/2 and 1/2. Taking the absolute value again, so f(sin(2πx)) will be in the range [0, 1/2].

Wait, let me verify. When |sin(2πx)| is less than or equal to 1/2, subtracting 1/2 would give a negative or zero, so taking absolute value flips it to 1/2 - |sin(2πx)|. When |sin(2πx)| is greater than 1/2, subtracting 1/2 gives a positive, so f(sin(2πx)) = |sin(2πx)| -1/2. So the output of f(sin(2πx)) is in [0, 1/2].

Then, we apply g to this result. So g(f(sin(2πx))) = ||f(sin(2πx))| - 1/4|. But since f(sin(2πx)) is non-negative, we can drop the outer absolute value. So it becomes |f(sin(2πx)) - 1/4|.

So, let's denote h(x) = f(sin(2πx)). Then, g(h(x)) is |h(x) - 1/4|. Now, h(x) ranges from 0 to 1/2. So when h(x) >= 1/4, which is when h(x) is from 1/4 to 1/2, g(h(x)) = h(x) - 1/4. When h(x) < 1/4, which is when h(x) is from 0 to 1/4, g(h(x)) = 1/4 - h(x). So the output of g(h(x)) is in [0, 1/4].

Then, we multiply by 4 to get y = 4g(f(sin(2πx))). So y ranges from 0 to 1. Because 4*(1/4) = 1, and 4*0=0.

Alright, so y is in [0,1]. Now, let's think about the other equation: x = 4g(f(cos(3πy))). Similarly, let's break this down.

First, cos(3πy). The cosine function has a range of [-
