Okay, so I have this problem with logarithms and three variables x, y, z. They're all positive real numbers, which is good because logarithms of non-positive numbers aren't defined. The problem gives me three equations involving logarithms base 2, and I need to find the absolute value of log base 2 of (x^4 y^3 z^2), then express that as a fraction m/n where m and n are coprime, and finally find m + n.

Let me write down the equations:

1. log₂(x / (y z)) = 1/2
2. log₂(y / (x z)) = 1/3
3. log₂(z / (x y)) = 1/4

I need to solve for x, y, z and then compute |log₂(x^4 y^3 z^2)|.

Hmm, maybe I can rewrite these logarithmic equations in exponential form to make them easier to handle. Remember that log_b(a) = c is equivalent to b^c = a.

So, rewriting each equation:

1. 2^(1/2) = x / (y z)
2. 2^(1/3) = y / (x z)
3. 2^(1/4) = z / (x y)

Let me denote these as equations (1), (2), and (3) respectively.

So, equation (1): x = 2^(1/2) * y z
Equation (2): y = 2^(1/3) * x z
Equation (3): z = 2^(1/4) * x y

This looks like a system of equations where each variable is expressed in terms of the others. Maybe I can substitute them into each other to find expressions for x, y, z.

Let me try to express all variables in terms of one variable, say x, then solve for x first.

From equation (1): x = 2^(1/2) * y z. Let me solve for y in terms of x and z.

Wait, maybe it's better to express y and z in terms of x.

From equation (2): y = 2^(1/3) * x z. So, if I can express z in terms of x, I can substitute into equation (3).

From equation (3): z = 2^(1/4) * x y. But from equation (2), y is 2^(1/3) x z. So substitute that into equation (3):

z = 2^(1/4) * x * [2^(1/3) x z] = 2^(1/4 + 1/3) * x^2 z

Simplify the exponents: 1/4 + 1/3 is... let me compute that.

1/4 is 3/12, 1/3 is 4/12, so together it's 7/12. So,

z = 2^(7/12) x^2 z

Hmm, so z = 2^(7/12) x^2 z. Let's subtract 2^(7/12) x^2 z from both sides:

z - 2^(7/12) x^2 z = 0

Factor out z:

z (1 - 2^(7/12) x^2) = 0

But z is a positive real number, so z ≠ 0. Therefore:

1 - 2^(7/12) x^2 = 0

Which implies:

2^(7/12) x^2 = 1

So, x^2 = 2^(-7/12)

Taking square roots, since x is positive:

x = 2^(-7/24)

Wait, because sqrt(2^(-7/12)) = 2^(-7/24). Right.

Now that I have x, I can find y and z.

From equation (2): y = 2^(1/3) * x z

But I need z in terms of x. Let's use equation (3): z = 2^(1/4) * x y

But since y is expressed in terms of x and z, this might get circular. Maybe substitute x into equation (1) or (2).

Wait, perhaps it's better to express y and z in terms of x, and then plug back into one of the equations.

But let me see: I have x = 2^(-7/24). Let me compute 2^(-7/24) as (2^(1/24))^(-7) or something, but maybe it's better to keep it as is for now.

Let me go back to equation (1): x = 2^(1/2) y z

We have x = 2^(-7/24), so:

2^(-7/24) = 2^(1/2) y z

Let me solve for y z:

y z = 2^(-7/24) / 2^(1/2) = 2^(-7/24 - 12/24) = 2^(-19/24)

So, y z = 2^(-19/24)  -- equation (4)

Similarly, from equation (2): y = 2^(1/3) x z

We have x = 2^(-7/24), so:

y = 2^(1/3) * 2^(-7/24) * z = 2^(8/24 - 7/24) * z = 2^(1/24) * z

So, y = 2^(1/24) z -- equation (5)

Now, substitute equation (5) into equation (4):

y z = [2^(1/24) z] * z = 2^(1/24) z^2 = 2^(-19/24)

Thus,

2^(1/24) z^2 = 2^(-19/24)

Divide both sides by 2^(1/24):

z^2 = 2^(-20/24) = 2^(-5/6)

Take square root (since z is positive):

z = 2^(-5/12)

So, z = 2^(-5/12)

Now, from equation (5), y = 2^(1/24) * z = 2^(1/24) * 2^(-5/12) = 2^(1/24 - 10/24) = 2^(-9/24) = 2^(-3/8)

So, y = 2^(-3/8)

Now, let me summarize:

x = 2^(-7/24)
y = 2^(-3/8)
z = 2^(-5/12)

Let me check these values with equation (3) to ensure consistency.

Equation (3): z = 2^(1/4) x y

Compute RHS: 2^(1/4) * x * y = 2^(1/4) * 2^(-7/24) * 2^(-3/8)

First, compute the exponents:

1/4 is 6/24, -7/24, and -3/8 is -9/24.

So, adding the exponents: 6/24 -7/24 -9/24 = (6 -7 -9)/24 = (-10)/24 = -5/12

So, RHS = 2^(-5/12), which equals z. So that's consistent. Good.

Now, all variables are found in terms of powers of 2. Now, the problem asks for |log₂(x^4 y^3 z^2)|.

Let me compute the exponent first:

x^4 y^3 z^2

Since x, y, z are powers of 2, their product will be 2 raised to the sum of their exponents multiplied by their respective powers.

So, let me express each term:

x^4 = [2^(-7/24)]^4 = 2^(-7/24 *4) = 2^(-7/6)

y^3 = [2^(-3/8)]^3 = 2^(-9/8)

z^2 = [2^(-5/12)]^2 = 2^(-5/6)

So, x^4 y^3 z^2 = 2^(-7/6) * 2^(-9/8) * 2^(-5/6)

Adding the exponents: (-7/6) + (-9/8) + (-5/6)

First, find a common denominator. 6, 8, 6. So, 24.

Convert each fraction:

-7/6 = -28/24

-9/8 = -27/24

-5/6 = -20/24

Adding them: (-28 -27 -20)/24 = (-75)/24

Simplify: -75/24 can be reduced. Both divided by 3: -25/8.

So, x^4 y^3 z^2 = 2^(-25/8)

Then, log₂(x^4 y^3 z^2) = log₂(2^(-25/8)) = -25/8

The absolute value is | -25/8 | = 25/8

So, m =25, n=8, which are coprime.

Therefore, m + n =25 +8=33.

Wait, let me double-check the exponent addition.

Wait, x^4 is (-7/24)*4= -7/6. Correct.

y^3 is (-3/8)*3= -9/8. Correct.

z^2 is (-5/12)*2= -5/6. Correct.

Adding exponents: -7/6 -9/8 -5/6.

Let me compute step by step.

First, -7/
