Okay, so I have this problem: Let ω ≠ 1 be a 13th root of unity. I need to find the remainder when the product from k=0 to 12 of (2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k}) is divided by 1000.

Hmm, first, let me make sure I understand what's being asked. We're dealing with roots of unity, specifically the 13th roots. Since ω is a primitive 13th root of unity (because ω ≠ 1), it means that ω^13 = 1, and no smaller positive integer exponent will give 1.

The expression given is a product over k from 0 to 12 of the term (2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k}). So each term in the product is a quadratic in ω^k, but since ω has order 13, ω^{2k} is just another root of unity.

I remember that for cyclotomic polynomials, the product over (x - ω^k) for k from 0 to 12 would give us the minimal polynomial for ω, which is the 13th cyclotomic polynomial. But here, the terms are more complicated: 2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k}.

I need to find a way to simplify this product. Maybe I can factor each term or find a pattern.

Let me look at the term inside the product: 2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k}. Let me denote x = ω^k. Then the term becomes 2 - 2x + x^2. Let me rearrange it: x^2 - 2x + 2. Hmm, that's a quadratic in x.

Wait, can I factor this quadratic? Let me check the discriminant: b² - 4ac = ( -2 )² - 4*1*2 = 4 - 8 = -4. So the roots are complex: [2 ± sqrt(-4)]/2 = 1 ± i. So the quadratic factors as (x - (1 + i))(x - (1 - i)).

So each term in the product is (x - (1 + i))(x - (1 - i)) where x = ω^k. Therefore, the entire product becomes the product from k=0 to 12 of (ω^k - (1 + i))(ω^k - (1 - i)).

But wait, the product over all ω^k is like evaluating a polynomial at certain points. Remember that for cyclotomic polynomials, the product over (x - ω^k) for k=0 to 12 is Φ_13(x) = x^12 + x^11 + ... + x + 1.

But in this case, each term is a product of two linear factors, so the entire product would be Φ_13(1 + i) * Φ_13(1 - i). Because each term is (ω^k - a)(ω^k - b), the product over all k is Φ_13(a) *
