Okay, so I have this problem about finding the number of rectangles that can be formed inside a regular dodecagon, which is a 12-sided polygon. Each side of the rectangle has to lie either on a side or a diagonal of the dodecagon. Hmm, I remember that in regular polygons, especially those with even sides, there are a lot of symmetries and diagonals, so maybe that can help.

First, I should visualize a regular dodecagon. It has 12 sides, all equal in length, and all internal angles equal too. Each internal angle in a regular dodecagon is 150 degrees, but I don't know if that's directly relevant here.

The key here is that the rectangles are formed by sides or diagonals of the dodecagon. So, each side of the rectangle must be either a side of the dodecagon or a diagonal connecting two non-adjacent vertices.

I think the approach here is to consider the diagonals and sides as possible edges for the rectangle. But how exactly?

Wait, in a regular polygon, a rectangle can be formed if the opposite sides are both sides or diagonals, and the angles between them are 90 degrees. But in a regular dodecagon, the angles between sides and diagonals might not necessarily be 90 degrees. So, perhaps only certain diagonals can form right angles with others.

Wait, another thought: in a regular polygon, rectangles can be formed by selecting two pairs of parallel sides or diagonals that are perpendicular to each other. So, perhaps I need to find all pairs of such lines that are perpendicular and then count how many rectangles they form.

But how do I determine which diagonals are perpendicular in a dodecagon?

Alternatively, maybe I can model the dodecagon on a coordinate system, like a unit circle, and calculate the slopes of the sides and diagonals to find which ones are perpendicular.

Let me try that approach. If I place the dodecagon on a unit circle centered at the origin, each vertex can be represented by a point (cos θ, sin θ), where θ is the angle from the positive x-axis. Since it's regular, the angle between consecutive vertices is 30 degrees (360/12 = 30).

So, the vertices are at angles 0°, 30°, 60°, ..., up to 330
