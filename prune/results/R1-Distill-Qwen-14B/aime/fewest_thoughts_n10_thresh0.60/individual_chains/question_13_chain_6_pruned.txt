Okay, so I need to solve this math problem about Aya's walks. Let me read it again carefully.

Every morning, Aya goes for a 9-kilometer-long walk and stops at a coffee shop afterwards. When she walks at a constant speed of s kilometers per hour, the walk takes her 4 hours, including t minutes spent in the coffee shop. When she walks s+2 kilometers per hour, the walk takes her 2 hours and 24 minutes, including t minutes spent in the coffee shop. Now, we need to find out how many minutes her walk takes when she walks at s + 1/2 kilometers per hour, including the t minutes in the coffee shop.

Hmm, okay. So the key points here are:

1. The distance of the walk is always 9 kilometers.
2. Her walking speed changes, and we have two different scenarios with different speeds and times.
3. In both scenarios, the time includes a coffee stop of t minutes.
4. We need to find the time taken when her speed is s + 1/2 km/h.

I think I can model this with some equations. Let's see.

First, when she walks at speed s km/h, the total time is 4 hours. But this time includes t minutes in the coffee shop. Wait, but the problem says the walk takes her 4 hours, including t minutes. So the total time is 4 hours, which includes both walking and the coffee stop. Similarly, when she walks faster, her total time is 2 hours and 24 minutes, which also includes t minutes.

Wait a second, so the total time is walking time plus t minutes. So for the first scenario:

Total time = walking time + t = 4 hours.

Similarly, in the second scenario:

Total time = walking time + t = 2 hours 24 minutes.

But wait, since t is included in both total times, perhaps we can subtract t from both to find the actual walking time. But we don't know t yet. Hmm.

Let me think. Alternatively, perhaps the time in the coffee shop is the same in both cases because it's t minutes each time. So maybe we can set up two equations where the walking time plus t equals the given total time.

But wait, t is a constant in both cases, right? Because she always spends t minutes in the coffee shop. So maybe we can write two equations:

For speed s km/h:
