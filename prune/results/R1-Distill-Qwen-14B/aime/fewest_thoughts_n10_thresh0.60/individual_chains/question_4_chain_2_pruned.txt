Okay, so I need to figure out how many positive integers n â‰¤ 2024 where Bob can guarantee a win against Alice in this token game. Let me try to break down the problem step by step.

First, the game is between Alice and Bob, starting with n tokens. They take turns, Alice first. On each turn, a player can remove either 1 or 4 tokens. The person who takes the last token wins. So, I need to find all n where Bob can force a win regardless of Alice's moves.

Hmm. So, since Alice goes first, for Bob to have a winning strategy, the starting position must be a losing position for Alice. In other words, n must be such that no matter what Alice does, Bob can always respond in a way that leads to his victory.

This sounds like a classic combinatorial game theory problem. I remember that such problems often involve finding "winning" and "losing" positions. A winning position is one where the current player can force a win, and a losing position is the opposite.

Let me try to model the game. Let's define a position as "good" if the current player can force a win, and "bad" if they can't, regardless of the opponent's moves.

So, the base case would be n=0. If there are no tokens left, the game is over, and the player who just took the last token wins. But wait, in our problem, the last token taken wins the game. So, if n=1, the player can take that last token and win. Similarly, for n=4, the player can take all 4 and win.

Wait, but for n=2, the player can take 1 token, leaving 1 for the opponent, who then takes it and wins. Alternatively, the player could take 4 tokens, but that's not possible since n=2 <4. So, for n=2, the player can only take 1, leaving 1 for the opponent. So n=2 is a losing position? Or is it a winning position?

Wait, no. Let me think again. For n=1: the current player takes 1 and wins. So n=1 is a winning position.

n=2: current player can take 1, leaving 1 for the opponent, who then takes it and wins. So, the current player can't force a win, so n=2 is a losing
