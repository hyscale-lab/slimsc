Okay, let's try to solve this problem. So, we have a list of positive integers with certain properties, and we need to find the sum of the squares of all the items. Hmm, let's break down the problem step by step.

First, the properties given are:

1. The sum of the items is 30.
2. The unique mode is 9.
3. The median is a positive integer that doesn't appear in the list.

Alright, let's tackle each property one by one and see how they can help us figure out the list.

Starting with the mode: the unique mode is 9. That means 9 appears more frequently than any other number in the list, and no other number has the same frequency as 9. So, 9 must occur at least twice, but more than any other number. If other numbers appear once, that's fine, but if any other number appears twice, then 9 needs to appear at least three times to maintain uniqueness.

Next, the median is a positive integer that doesn't appear in the list. That's interesting because usually, the median is one of the numbers in the list. For example, if the list has an odd number of elements, the median is the middle number. But here, it's a number that isn't there. So, the median must be between two numbers or maybe the average of two numbers if the list has an even number of elements.

Wait, but the median has to be a positive integer, and it's not in the list. So, if the list has an even number of elements, the median would be the average of the two middle numbers. But since the median is an integer, the average must be an integer. That means the two middle numbers must be either both even or both odd so their sum is even, making the average an integer.

Alternatively, if the list has an odd number of elements, the median is the middle number, which is in the list, but that can't be the case here because the median isn't in the list. So, the list must have an even number of elements. Therefore, the median is the average of the two middle numbers, which is an integer not present in the list.

So, let's consider that the list has an even number of elements. Let's say the list has 2n elements. Then, the median is the average of the nth and (n+1)th elements. Since this average is an integer and not present in the list, the two middle numbers must add up to an even integer. Also, the two middle numbers can't be the same as the median, but since the median isn't in the list, that's okay.

Wait, but if the median is the average of two numbers, those two numbers could be, say, 8
