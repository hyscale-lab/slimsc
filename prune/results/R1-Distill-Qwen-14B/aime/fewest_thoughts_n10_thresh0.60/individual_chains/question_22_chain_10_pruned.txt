Okay, let's tackle this problem. So, we have a convex equilateral hexagon named ABCDEF. That means all its sides are equal in length, right? And all pairs of opposite sides are parallel. Hmm, interesting. So, AB is parallel to DE, BC is parallel to EF, and CD is parallel to FA.

The problem says that the triangle formed by extending the sides AB, CD, and EF has side lengths 200, 240, and 300. We need to find the side length of the hexagon.

I remember that in such hexagons, especially convex and equilateral with opposite sides parallel, they are sometimes referred to as "affine regular" hexagons or something similar, but I'm not entirely sure. But the key property here is that the sides are equal and opposite sides are parallel. So, the hexagon can be thought of as being formed by three pairs of parallel and equal sides.

Now, the triangle formed by extending AB, CD, and EF. Let me visualize this. If I extend AB, CD, and EF, they should meet at three points forming a triangle. Each of these sides, when extended, becomes a side of this larger triangle. The lengths of these sides are 200, 240, and 300.

I think the hexagon can be inscribed in this triangle, with each side of the hexagon cutting off a smaller triangle from the larger one. Since the hexagon is equilateral, all its sides are equal, so each of these smaller triangles should be similar to the larger triangle.

Wait, let me think. If the hexagon is convex and equilateral with opposite sides parallel, then when we extend AB, CD, EF, each pair of extensions will meet at a vertex of the larger triangle. So, each side of the larger triangle is formed by the extensions of sides of the hexagon.

In such a configuration, the hexagon is similar to the larger triangle but scaled down. But since all sides of the hexagon are equal, the scaling factors for each side must be consistent.

Let me denote the side length of the hexagon as 's'. Then, each extension beyond the hexagon on each side of the larger triangle would form a smaller similar triangle with the larger triangle.

Alternatively, each side of the larger triangle is divided into segments by the hexagon. Let's say for the side of length 200, it's divided into two parts: one part is the side of the hexagon 's', and the other part is the extension beyond the hexagon. Since the hexagon is convex and the sides are extended to form the large triangle, each side of the triangle is longer than the corresponding side of the hexagon.

Wait, maybe I should model this using similar triangles. If I look at the triangle formed by AB, CD, EF extensions, each side of this triangle is a sum of the hex
