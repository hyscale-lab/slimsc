Okay, so I have this math problem to solve. Let me read it again and make sure I understand it correctly.

We need to find the number of triples of nonnegative integers (a, b, c) such that a + b + c = 300 and a²b + a²c + b²a + b²c + c²a + c²b = 6,000,000.

Hmm, okay. So, two equations involving a, b, and c. The first one is linear, and the second one is a bit more complicated, involving quadratic terms.

Let me think about how to approach this. Maybe I can find a way to simplify the second equation. Let's look at it more closely.

The expression is a²b + a²c + b²a + b²c + c²a + c²b. I notice that each term is of the form x²y, where x and y are two different variables. So, it's like summing all possible x²y terms where x and y are distinct.

Wait a minute, perhaps I can factor this expression somehow. Let me try to factor it:

a²b + a²c + b²a + b²c + c²a + c²b = a²(b + c) + b²(a + c) + c²(a + b)

That's right. Because a²b + a²c is a²(b + c), and similarly for the other terms.

Now, since a + b + c = 300, I can express (b + c) as (300 - a), right? Because if a + b + c = 300, then subtracting a from both sides gives b + c = 300 - a. Same for the others.

So, substituting that in, the expression becomes:

a²(300 - a) + b²(300 - b) + c²(300 - c)

Which simplifies to:

300a² - a³ + 300b² - b³ + 300c² - c³

So, the entire expression is 300(a² + b² + c²) - (a³ + b³ + c³).

And we know that this equals 6,000,000.

So, we have:

300(a² + b² + c²) - (a³ + b³ + c³) = 6,000,000.

Hmm, that's interesting. Let me denote S = a + b + c = 300, Q = ab + bc + ca, and T = abc. Maybe I can express a² + b² + c² and a³ + b³ + c³ in terms of S, Q, and T.

I remember that a² + b² + c² = S² - 2Q. Also, a³ + b³ + c³ = S³ - 3SQ + 3T.

So, substituting these into our equation:

300(S² - 2Q) - (S³ - 3SQ + 3T) = 6,000,000.

But since S = 300, let's plug that in:

300(300² - 2Q) - (300³ - 3*300*Q + 3T) = 6,000,000.

Let me compute each part step by step.

First, compute 300²: that's 90,000. Then, 300² - 2Q is 90,000 - 2Q.

Multiply that by 300: 300*(90,000 - 2Q) = 27,000,000 - 600Q.

Next, compute 300³: 300 * 300 * 300. Let's compute 300*300 first, which is 90,000. Then 90,000 * 300 = 27,000,000. So, 300³ is 27,000,000.

Then, 3*300*Q is 900Q. So, the term 300³ - 3*300*Q is 27,000,000 - 900Q.

But wait, the expression is subtracting (300³ - 3*300*Q + 3T). So, that is:

27,000,000 - 900Q + 3T.

So, putting it all together, the equation becomes:

[27,000,000 - 600Q] - [27,000,000 - 900Q + 3T] = 6,000,000.

Let me simplify this step by step.

First, distribute the negative sign across the second bracket:

27,000,000 - 600Q - 27,000,000 + 900Q - 3T = 6,000,000.

Now, the 27,000,000 and -27,000,000 cancel out.

We're left with (-600Q + 900Q) - 3T = 6,000,000.
