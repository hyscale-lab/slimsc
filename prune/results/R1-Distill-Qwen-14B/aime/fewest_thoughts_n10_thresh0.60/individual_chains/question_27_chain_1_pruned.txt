Okay, so I have this problem about a torus and a sphere. Let me try to understand what's being asked here. The torus T is created by revolving a circle of radius 3 around an axis that's in the same plane as the circle and is 6 units away from the center. So, it's like a donut shape. The sphere S has a radius of 11.

When the torus rests inside the sphere, it's internally tangent along a circle with radius r_i. When it rests outside, it's externally tangent along a circle with radius r_o. The problem asks for the difference r_i - r_o, which can be expressed as a fraction m/n where m and n are coprime. Then, I need to find m + n.

Hmm, okay, so I need to find the radii of the circles along which the torus is tangent to the sphere in both internal and external cases. Then, subtract them and simplify the fraction.

Let me recall some properties of tori and spheres. A torus can be described using two radii: the major radius R, which is the distance from the center of the generating circle to the axis of revolution, and the minor radius r, which is the radius of the generating circle itself. In this case, the minor radius is 3, and since the axis is 6 units from the center of the circle, the major radius R is 6.

So, the torus has major radius R = 6 and minor radius r = 3.

The sphere has radius 11. So, when the torus is inside the sphere, it's touching the sphere internally, meaning the sphere is larger. When it's outside, the torus is larger and touches the sphere externally.

Wait, actually, no. The torus is a fixed size. When it rests on the inside, it's inside the sphere and tangent to it, and when it's on the outside, it's outside the sphere but still tangent. Hmm, but how? Because the sphere has a radius of 11, and the torus's major radius is 6, so the outer radius of the torus is R + r = 6 + 3 = 9, which is less than 11. So, the torus can fit inside the sphere, touching it internally. But when resting outside, the torus would be externally tangent, so the torus must enclose the sphere? Wait, that doesn't make sense because the torus's outer radius is 9, which is less than 11, so the sphere is bigger. Hmm, perhaps my initial understanding is wrong.

Wait, maybe when it's resting on the outside, the sphere is inside the torus. Because if the sphere is of radius 11, and the torus's outer radius is 9, which is smaller, so the sphere is bigger. So, if the torus is placed on the outside of the sphere, it's actually the sphere that is inside the torus? But how? A torus is a surface, so perhaps the sphere is inside the hole of the torus.

Wait, maybe I need to visualize this better. The torus is like a donut, major radius
