Okay, so I have this math problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again:

"Let $N$ be the greatest four-digit positive integer with the property that whenever one of its digits is changed to $1$, the resulting number is divisible by $7$. Let $Q$ and $R$ be the quotient and remainder, respectively, when $N$ is divided by $1000$. Find $Q+R$."

Hmm, okay. So, N is a four-digit number. Let me break it down. N is the largest four-digit number, which is 9999, but it has a specific property. Whenever any one of its digits is changed to 1, the new number is divisible by 7.

So, for example, if I change the thousands digit to 1, the number becomes 1xyz, and that should be divisible by 7. Similarly, changing the hundreds digit, tens digit, or units digit to 1 should also result in numbers divisible by 7.

I need to find such a number N, the largest possible four-digit number, and then compute Q + R where Q is the quotient when N is divided by 1000, and R is the remainder.

Wait, dividing N by 1000: So Q would be the thousands digit, right? Because 1000 goes into N Q times with remainder R, which is the last three digits. So Q is the thousands digit, R is the last three digits. So Q + R would be the thousands digit plus the last three digits. For example, if N was 9876, then Q is 9, R is 876, so Q+R is 885.

But first, I need to find N. Let's think about the properties.

Let me denote N as a four-digit number: N = a b c d, where a, b, c, d are digits from 0 to 9, and a ≠ 0 since it's a four-digit number.

So N is 1000a + 100b + 10c + d.

The problem states that if any one digit is changed to 1, the resulting number is divisible by 7.

So, that gives four conditions:

1. Changing a to 1: 1 b c d → 1000 + 100b + 10c + d must be divisible by 7.
2. Changing b to 1: a 1 c d → 1000a + 100 + 10c + d must be divisible by 7.
3. Changing c to 1: a b 1 d → 1000a + 100b + 10 + d must be divisible by 7.
4. Changing d to 1: a b c 1 → 1000a + 100b + 10c + 1 must be divisible by 7.

So, each of these four numbers must be divisible by 7. And our original N must be the largest such number.

We need to find the maximum N=abcd (four-digit) such that all four of the above modified numbers are divisible by 7.

Let me think about how to approach this.

I think I can model each of these conditions as congruencies modulo 7.

Let me write N as 1000a + 100b + 10c + d.

Then, when we change a to 1, the number becomes 1000 + 100b + 10c + d. Let me compute this modulo 7.

Similarly, for each condition, I can write the modified number modulo 7 and set it equal to 0.

Let me compute each modified number modulo 7.

First, 1000 modulo 7: Let's calculate that.

7 × 142 = 994. So 1000 - 994 = 6, so 1000 ≡ 6 mod 7.

Similarly, 100 mod 7: 7×14=98, so 100 ≡ 2 mod7.

10 mod7 is 3, and 1 mod7 is 1.

So, let's compute each modified number:

1. Changing a to 1: 1bcd = 1000 + 100b + 10c + d.

Modulo7, this is (1000 mod7) + (100b mod7) + (10c mod7) + (d mod7) = 6 + 2b + 3c + d ≡ 0 mod7.

2. Changing b to 1: a1cd = 1000a + 100 + 10c + d.

Modulo7: (1000a mod7) is 6a, (100 mod7) is 2, so 6a + 2 + 3c + d ≡ 0 mod7.

3. Changing c to 1: ab1d = 1000a + 100b + 10 + d.

Modulo7: 6a + 2b + (10 mod7=3) + d ≡ 6a + 2b + 3 + d ≡ 0 mod7.

4. Changing d to 1: abc1 = 1000a + 100b + 10c +1.

Modulo7: 6a + 2b + 3c +1 ≡ 0 mod7.

So, we have four equations:

1. 6 + 2b + 3c + d ≡ 0 mod7.  → Equation (1)
2. 6a + 2 + 3c + d ≡ 0 mod7.  → Equation (2)
3. 6a + 2b + 3 + d ≡ 0 mod7.  → Equation (3)
4. 6a + 2b + 3c + 1 ≡ 0 mod7.  → Equation (4)

So, we have four congruencies.

Let me write them all:

Equation (1): 2b + 3c + d ≡ -6 ≡ 1 mod7 (since -6 mod7 is 1).

Equation (2): 6a + 3c + d ≡ -2 ≡ 5 mod7.

Equation (3): 6a + 2b + d ≡ -3 ≡ 4 mod7.

Equation (4): 6a + 2b + 3c ≡ -1 ≡ 6 mod7.

So, now I have four equations:

1. 2b + 3c + d ≡ 1 mod7. → (1)
2. 6a + 3c + d ≡5 mod7. → (2)
3. 6a + 2b + d ≡4 mod7. → (3)
4. 6a + 2b + 3c ≡6 mod7. → (4)

We can try to solve this system.

Let me see if I can express some variables in terms of others.

Looking at equations (1) and (4). Let me denote.

Equation (4): 6a + 2b + 3c ≡6 mod7.

Equation (1): 2b +3c +d ≡1 mod7.

Subtract equation (1) from equation (4):

(6a + 2b +3c) - (2b +3c +d) ≡6 -1 mod7.

Simplify:

6a - d ≡5 mod7.

So, 6a - d ≡5 mod7 → equation (5).

Similarly, let's look at equations (2) and (3):

Equation (2):6a +3c +d ≡5 mod7.

Equation (3):6a +2b +d ≡4 mod7.

Subtract equation (3) from equation (2):

(6a +3c +d) - (6a +2b +d) ≡5 -4 mod7.

Simplify:

3c -2b ≡1 mod7 → equation (6).

So, Equation (6): 3c -2b ≡1 mod7.

Now, let's see equation (5): 6a - d ≡5 mod7 → d ≡6a -5 mod7.

Let me write this as d ≡6a +2 mod7 (since -5 mod7 is 2).

So, d ≡6a +2 mod7. → Equation (5a)

Similarly, from equation (4): 6a +2b +3c ≡6 mod7.

We can write equation (4) as 6a +2b +3c =6 mod7.

Also, from equation (1): 2b +3c +d ≡1 mod7.

But from equation (5a), d=6a +2 mod7. Substitute into equation (1):

2b +3c + (6a +2) ≡1 mod7.

Simplify:

6a +2b +3c +2 ≡1 mod7.

Which is 6a +2b +3c ≡-1 ≡6 mod7.

Wait, but equation (4) is exactly 6a +2b +3c ≡6 mod7. So, that's consistent. So, no new info here.

Similarly, let's see equation (2):6a +3c +d ≡5 mod7.

Again, substituting d=6a +2 mod7 into equation (2):

6a +3c +6a +2 ≡5 mod7.

Simplify: 12a +3c +2 ≡5 mod7.

12a mod7 is 12-7=5, so 5a mod7. So, 5a +3c +2 ≡5 mod7.

Subtract 2: 5a +3c ≡3 mod7. → equation (7).

Similarly, equation (3):6a +2b +d ≡4 mod7.

Substituting d=6a +2 mod7:

6a +2b +6a +2 ≡4 mod7.

Simplify: 12a +2b +2 ≡4 mod7.

12a mod7 is 5a, so 5a +2b +2 ≡4 mod7.

Subtract 2:5a +2b ≡2 mod7. → equation (8).

So, now, our equations are:

Equation (6): 3c -2b ≡1 mod7.

Equation (7):5a +3c ≡3 mod7.

Equation (8):5a +2b ≡2 mod7.

So, let's focus on equations (6), (7), and (8).

From equation (6): 3c ≡2b +1 mod7.
