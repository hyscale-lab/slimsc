Okay, so I have this problem about a tetrahedron ABCD. The edges are given with specific lengths: AB and CD are both sqrt(41), AC and BD are sqrt(80), and BC and AD are sqrt(89). There's a point I inside the tetrahedron that's equidistant from all four faces, and I need to find that distance, which is given in the form m*sqrt(n)/p. Then, I have to calculate m + n + p.

Hmm, okay. So, let me start by recalling some properties of tetrahedrons and the inradius. Wait, in a tetrahedron, the inradius is the radius of the inscribed sphere that is tangent to all its faces. So, the point I is the incenter, and the distance we're looking for is the inradius.

I remember that for a tetrahedron, the inradius can be found using the formula: inradius r = 3V / S, where V is the volume of the tetrahedron and S is the total surface area. So, I need to find the volume and the surface area.

But first, how can I find the volume of this tetrahedron? I know that for a tetrahedron, the volume can be calculated using the Cayley-Menger determinant if we know all the edge lengths. Let me recall the formula for that.

The Cayley-Menger determinant for a tetrahedron with edge lengths AB = a, AC = b, AD = c, BC = d, BD = e, CD = f is given by:

Volume = sqrt( |CM| / 288 ), where CM is the Cayley-Menger determinant:

| 0   1    1    1    1  |
| 1   0   a²  b²  c² |
| 1  a²   0   d²  e² |
| 1  b²  d²   0   f² |
| 1  c²  e²  f²   0  |

So, I need to plug in the given edge lengths into this determinant. Let me list the edge lengths again:

AB = sqrt(41), so a² = 41.
AC = sqrt(80), so b² = 80.
AD = sqrt(89), so c² = 89.
BC = sqrt(89), so d² = 89.
BD = sqrt(80), so e² = 80.
CD = sqrt(41), so f² = 41.

So, the determinant will have the squares of these edge lengths. Let me set up the CM determinant:

CM = | 0    1     1     1     1   |
     | 1    0    41    80    89  |
     | 1   41    0    89    80  |
     | 1   80   89     0    41  |
     | 1   89   80    41     0  |

I need to compute this determinant. That's a 5x5 determinant, which might be a bit tedious, but let's proceed step by step.

I'll denote the determinant as follows:

Row 0: [0, 1, 1, 1, 1]
Row 1: [1, 0, 41, 80, 89]
Row 2: [1, 41, 0, 89, 80]
Row 3: [1, 80, 89, 0, 41]
Row 4: [1, 89, 80, 41, 0]

To compute this determinant, perhaps I can expand along the first row since it has a zero which might simplify calculations. The determinant is calculated as:

CM = 0 * det(minor) - 1 * det(minor) + 1
