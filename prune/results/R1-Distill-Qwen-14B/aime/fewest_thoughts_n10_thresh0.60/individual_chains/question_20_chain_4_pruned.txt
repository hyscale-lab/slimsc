Okay, so I have this problem here about placing chips on a 5x5 grid. There are 25 white chips and 25 black chips, but they're indistinguishable. The conditions are a bit tricky, but I'll try to break them down.

First, each cell can hold at most one chip. That makes sense. So no two chips in the same cell, but since they're indistinct, it's just about where the chips are, not which ones.

The second condition is that all chips in the same row must be the same color, and the same goes for all chips in the same column. So if I have a chip in a row, every other cell in that row must be either all white or all black. Same with columns. Wait, that seems like a strong condition. So, for example, if I place a white chip in a particular row, then the entire row must be white, or else that condition is violated.

Third condition: any additional chip placed would violate the previous two conditions. So the arrangement should be maximal in the sense that we can't add any more chips without breaking the row or column color uniformity.

Hmm. So the problem is to find the number of such arrangements.

Let me think about how the grid can be colored. Since each row must be all white or all black, and same for each column, the grid must be such that each row and column is monochromatic. But with the additional constraint that the placement is maximalâ€”meaning you can't add any more chips without violating the color conditions.

Wait, but if each row is monochromatic, and each column is monochromatic, that actually imposes a lot of structure on the grid. For example, if a row is white, then all the columns that intersect it must also be white in that row's position. Wait, no, because the column can be a different color. Wait, no, because if a column has a white chip in a row that's white, then that column must be all white. But wait, no, because the column's color is determined by all its chips.

Wait, maybe I need to think about this differently. Suppose we have a grid where every row is either all white or all black, and every column is either all white or all black. But wait, that's not quite right because the colors of the rows and columns have to be consistent with each other.

Wait, for example, if I have a white row and a
