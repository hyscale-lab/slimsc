Okay, so I've got this problem here: Find the largest possible real part of the expression (75 + 117i)z + (96 + 144i)/z, where z is a complex number with |z| = 4. Hmm, that sounds a bit tricky, but let me see if I can figure it out.

First, I remember that for complex numbers, especially when dealing with expressions like this, polar form might be helpful because it can simplify multiplication and division. Since the modulus of z is given as 4, that could come in handy. So, I can write z as 4e^{iθ}, where θ is the argument of z. That makes sense.

So, let's rewrite z as 4e^{iθ}. Then, 1/z would be (1/4)e^{-iθ}, right? Because the modulus of 1/z is 1/|z|, which is 1/4, and the argument is the negative of the argument of z.

Now, let's substitute z and 1/z into the expression:

(75 + 117i) * 4e^{iθ} + (96 + 144i) * (1/4)e^{-iθ}

Let me compute each part separately. First, (75 + 117i) multiplied by 4:

75 * 4 = 300, 117 * 4 = 468. So, that part becomes 300 + 468i.

Then, I have to multiply that by e^{iθ}. Hmm, e^{iθ} is cosθ + i sinθ, so multiplying (300 + 468i) by (cosθ + i sinθ). Let me expand that:

300 cosθ + 300 i sinθ + 468i cosθ + 468i^2 sinθ.

But i^2 is -1, so that becomes:

300 cosθ + 300i sinθ + 468i cosθ - 468 sinθ.

Combine like terms:

Real parts: 300 cosθ - 468 sinθ.
Imaginary parts: (300 sinθ + 468 cosθ) i.

So the first part is (300 cosθ - 468 sinθ) + i(300 sinθ + 468 cosθ).

Now, the second part of the expression is (96 + 144i) multiplied by (1/4)e^{-iθ}.

Compute (96 + 144i) * (1/4):

96 * 1/4 = 24, 144 * 1/4 = 36. So, it becomes 24 + 36i.

Now, multiply that by e^{-iθ}, which is cosθ - i sinθ.

So, (24 + 36i)(cosθ - i sinθ).

Expanding this:

24 cosθ - 24i sinθ + 36i cosθ - 36i^2 sinθ.

Again, i^2 is -1, so:

24 cosθ - 24i sinθ + 36i cosθ + 36 sinθ.

Combine like terms:

Real parts: 24 cosθ + 36 sinθ.
Imaginary parts: (-24 sinθ + 36 cosθ) i.

So, the second part is (24 cosθ + 36 sinθ) + i(-24 sinθ + 36 cosθ).

Now, add the two parts together:

First part real: (300 cosθ - 468 sinθ)
Second part real: (24 cosθ + 36 sinθ)
Total real part: 300 cosθ - 468 sinθ + 24 cosθ + 36 sinθ
= (300 + 24) cosθ + (-468 + 36) sinθ
= 324 cosθ - 432 sinθ.

Similarly for the imaginary parts, but since the problem is asking only for the real part, I can focus on that.

So, the real part is 324 cosθ - 432 sinθ. I need to find the maximum value of this expression as θ varies.

Hmm, how do I find the maximum of an expression of the form A cosθ + B sinθ? I remember that it's equal to sqrt(A^2 + B^2) multiplied by cos(theta - phi), where phi is some angle such that cos phi = A / sqrt(A^2 + B^2) and sin phi = B / sqrt(A^2 + B^2). So, the maximum value would be sqrt(A^2 + B^2).

Wait, but in our case, it's 324 cosθ - 432 sinθ. So, that can be written as (324) cosθ + (-432) sinθ.

So, A is 324, and B is -432.

So, sqrt(A^2 + B^2) would be sqrt(324^2 + (-432)^2). Let me compute that.

First, 324 squared: 324 * 324. Let me compute 324 * 300 = 97200, 324 * 24=7776. So, 97200 + 7776 = 104976.

Then, 432 squared: 432 * 432. Well, 400^2 is 160000, 32^2 is 1024. Then, 2 * 400 *32 = 25600. So, (400 +32)^2 = 400² + 2*400*32 +32² = 160000 +25600 +1024= 160000 +25600= 185600; 185600 +1024= 186624.

Wait, but since B is -432, B^2 is 432^2, which is 186624.

So, the sum is 104976 + 186624 = 291600.

So, sqrt(291600) = 540.

Because 540^2 = (54 *10)^2 = 54^2 * 100 = 2916 * 100 = 291600.

So, the maximum value of the real part is 540.

Wait, that seems straightforward. So, the maximum real part is 540.

But let me just double-check my calculations to be sure.

First, 324 squared: 324 * 324. Let me compute 300*300=90000, 300*24=7200, 24*300=7200, and 24*24=576. So, (300 +24)^2=300^2 + 2*300*24 +24^2=90000 + 14400 +576=90000+14400=104400 +576=104976. Correct.

432 squared: 400^2=160000, 32^2=1024, and 2*400*32=25600. So, as I did before, 160000 + 25600 +1024= 186624. Correct.

Adding 104976 + 186624: 100000 +180000=280000, 4976 +6624= 11600. So, total is 280000 +11600=291600. Correct.

sqrt(291600)=540. Correct.

So, the maximum real part is 540.

Wait, but just to make sure I didn't make a mistake earlier when expanding the expressions.

First, when I multiplied (75 +117i) by 4, I got 300 +468i. Correct, 75*4=300, 117*4=468.

Then, multiplying by e^{iθ}=cosθ +i sinθ, which I correctly expanded into real and imaginary parts.

Then for the second term, (96 +144i) * (1/4) is 24 +36i. Correct.

Then multiplied by e^{-iθ}=cosθ -i sinθ. Correct, and then expanded into real and imaginary parts.

So, when adding the real parts from both terms:

300 cosθ -468 sinθ +24 cosθ +36 sinθ.

Which is (300+24) cosθ + (-468 +36) sinθ.

300 +24=324, -
