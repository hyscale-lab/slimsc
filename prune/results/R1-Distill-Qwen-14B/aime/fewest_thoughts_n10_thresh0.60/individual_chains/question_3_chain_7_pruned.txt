Okay, so I just came across this probability problem, and I want to figure it out step by step. Let me try to understand what's being asked here.

Jen is entering a lottery by picking 4 distinct numbers from the set S = {1,2,3,...,10}. Then, 4 numbers are randomly chosen from S. She wins a prize if at least two of her numbers match two of the randomly chosen numbers. She wins the grand prize if all four of her numbers match the four chosen.

The question is about finding the probability that she wins the grand prize given that she won a prize. They mentioned that this probability can be expressed as m/n where m and n are coprime positive integers, and we need to find m + n.

Hmm, okay. So, this is a conditional probability problem. The formula for conditional probability is P(A|B) = P(A ∩ B) / P(B). In this case, event A is winning the grand prize, and event B is winning a prize. Since winning the grand prize automatically means she has at least two numbers correct, A is a subset of B. So, P(A ∩ B) is just P(A). Therefore, the probability we need is P(A) / P(B).

So, I need to compute P(A) and P(B) and then take their ratio.

First, let's figure out the total number of possible ways the lottery can be drawn. Since 4 numbers are chosen from 10, the total number of possible combinations is the combination of 10 choose 4, which is C(10,4).

Calculating that, C(10,4) = 10! / (4! * (10-4)!) = (10*9*8*7)/(4*3*2*1) = 210.

So, the total number of possible lottery outcomes is 210.

Now, let's compute P(A), which is the probability that Jen wins the grand prize. That happens only when all four of her numbers are the same as the four chosen. Since Jen has already picked 4 specific numbers, there's exactly 1 favorable outcome (the one where all four match). So, P(A) = 1 / 210.

Next, let's compute P(B), the probability that she wins a prize. This is the probability that at least two of her numbers are among the four chosen. To find this, it's often easier to compute the complement probability and subtract from 1.

The complement of winning a prize is not winning a prize, which means that fewer than two numbers match. So, that would be the cases where 0 or 1 of her numbers are chosen.

So, P(B) = 1 - [P(0 matches) + P(1 match)].

Let me compute P(0 matches) and P(1 match).

P(0 matches): This is the probability that none of her 4 numbers are chosen. So, all four numbers chosen are from the remaining 6 numbers (since 10 - 4 = 6). Therefore, the number of ways to choose 4 numbers from 6 is C(6,4).

C(6,4) = 15.

So, the number of ways to have 0 matches is 15. Hence, P(0 matches) = 15 / 210.

P(1 match): This is the probability that exactly one of her numbers is chosen. To compute this, we choose 1 number from her 4, and 3 numbers from the remaining 6. So, the number of ways is C(4,1) * C(6,3).

C(4,1) is 4, and C(6,3) is 20. So, 4 * 20 = 80.

Therefore, the number of ways to have 1 match is 80. Hence, P(1 match) = 80 / 210.

So, putting it together, P(B) = 1 - (15 + 80)/210 = 1 - 95/210.

Calculating 95/210, that simplifies to 19/42. So, P(B) = 1 - 19/42 = (42/42 - 19/42) = 23/42.

Wait, hold on, let me double-check that math. Because 15 + 80 is 95, right? And 95 divided by 210 is indeed 19/42. So, 1 - 19/42 is 23/42. So, P(B) is 23/42.

Wait, but let me think again. Is that correct? Because 15 + 80 is 95, and 95/210 simplifies to 19/42. So, 1 - 19/42 is 23/42. Hmm, okay, that seems right.

But wait, let me think about the counts again to make sure I didn't make a mistake.

Total possible combinations: 210.

Number of ways with 0 matches: C(6,4) = 15.

Number of ways with 1 match: C(4,1)*C(6,3) = 4*20 = 80.

So, 15 + 80 = 95, which is the number of ways where she doesn't win a prize. So, the number of ways she does win a prize is 210 - 95 = 115. Therefore, P(B) = 115 / 210.

Wait, wait, 210 - 95 is 115, so 115/210 simplifies. Let me see, 115 and 210 are both divisible by 5: 115/5=23, 210/5=42. So,
