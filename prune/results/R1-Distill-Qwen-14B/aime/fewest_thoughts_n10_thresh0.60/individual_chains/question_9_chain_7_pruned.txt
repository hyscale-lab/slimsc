Okay, so I have this logarithm problem here. It says that there are real numbers x and y, both greater than 1, such that log base x of y^x equals 10, and log base y of x^(4y) also equals 10. I need to find the product xy. Hmm, logarithms can be tricky, but let me break it down step by step.

First, I remember that logarithms can be rewritten using the change of base formula. Maybe I can express both equations in terms of logarithms with a common base, like natural logs or base 10, and then set up a system of equations to solve for x and y.

Let me start with the first equation: log_x(y^x) = 10. Using the logarithm power rule, which says that log_b(a^k) = k*log_b(a), I can rewrite this as x * log_x(y) = 10. Since log_x(y) is the logarithm of y with base x, and I know that log_b(a) = ln(a)/ln(b), maybe I can express this in terms of natural logs.

So, log_x(y) = ln(y)/ln(x). Plugging that back into the equation, I get x * (ln(y)/ln(x)) = 10. Let's denote this as equation (1): x*(ln y)/(ln x) = 10.

Now, moving on to the second equation: log_y(x^(4y)) = 10. Similarly, using the power rule, this becomes 4y * log_y(x) = 10. Again, log_y(x) can be written as ln(x)/ln(y). So substituting that in, we have 4y*(ln x)/(ln y) = 10. Let's call this equation (2): 4y*(ln x)/(ln y) = 10.

Hmm, now I have two equations:

1. x * (ln y)/(ln x) = 10
2. 4y * (ln x)/(ln y) = 10

These look a bit similar, but let's see if we can manipulate them to find a relationship between x and y. Let's denote (ln y)/(ln x) as A. Then equation (1) becomes x * A = 10, so A = 10/x.

Looking at equation (2), notice that (ln x)/(ln y) is 1/A. So equation (2) becomes 4y * (1/A) = 10. Since A = 10/x, substituting that in gives 4y * (x/10) = 10.

Simplify equation (2): (4y * x)/10 = 10. Multiply both sides by 10: 4xy = 100. Divide both sides by 4: xy = 25.

Wait, that seems straightforward. So xy equals 25? But I should verify if that's consistent with both equations.

Let me see. If xy = 25, then y = 25/x. Let's plug this back into equation (1) to see if it holds.

Equation (1): x*(ln y)/(ln x) = 10.

Substitute y = 25/x: x*(ln(25/x))/(ln x) = 10.

Let me compute ln(25/x) as ln(25) - ln(x). So the equation becomes:

x*(ln(25) - ln(x)) / (ln x) = 10.

This simplifies to x*(ln(25)/ln x - 1) = 10.

Let me denote ln x as a. Then ln(25) is a constant, ln(25) â‰ˆ 3.2189, but I'll keep it as ln(25) for exactness.

So, the equation becomes x*(ln(25)/a - 1) = 10.

But x = e^{a}, since a = ln x. So substituting that in:

e^{a}*(ln(25)/a - 1) = 10.

Hmm, this looks a bit complicated. Maybe there's another way to approach it.

Alternatively, perhaps taking both equations and dividing one by the other to eliminate some variables. Let's try that.

Equation (1): x*(ln y)/(ln x) = 10.

Equation (2): 4y*(ln x)/(ln y) = 10.

If I divide equation (1) by equation (2), I get:

[ x*(ln y)/(ln x) ] / [4y*(ln x)/(ln y) ] = 10/10.

Simplify the left side:

(x * (ln y)/(ln x)) * (ln y)/(4y * (ln x)) ) = 1.

So that becomes (x * (ln y)^2) / (4y * (ln x)^2 ) = 1.

Simplify numerator and denominator:

(x / (4y)) * ( (ln y)^2 / (ln x)^2 ) = 1.

But since we found earlier that xy =25, which means x =25/y. So substituting x =25/y into the equation:

( (25/y) / (4y) ) * ( (ln y)^2 / (ln x)^2 ) =1.

Simplify (25/y)/(4y) = 25/(4y^2).

So 25/(4y^2) * ( (ln y)^2 / (ln x)^2 ) )=1.

But x =25/y, so ln x = ln(25/y) = ln25 - ln y.

So (ln x)^2 = (ln25 - ln y)^2.

Substituting that in:

25/(4y^2) * ( (ln y)^2 ) / ( (ln25 - ln y)^2 ) =1.

This seems complicated. Maybe I should try a substitution or assume a relationship between x and y. For example, perhaps x and y are related as powers of each other, but I'm not sure.

Wait, alternatively, let me go back to the idea that we have xy =25, so perhaps x =25/y. Let me use that and substitute into equation (1).

Equation (1): x*(ln y)/(ln x) =10.

Substituting x =25/y:

(25/y) * (ln y)/(ln(25/y)) =10.

ln(25/y) is ln25 - ln y, so:

(25/y) * ln y / (ln25 - ln y) =10.

Let me denote t = ln y. Then ln25 is a constant, say k = ln25.

So equation becomes:

(25/y) * t / (k - t)
