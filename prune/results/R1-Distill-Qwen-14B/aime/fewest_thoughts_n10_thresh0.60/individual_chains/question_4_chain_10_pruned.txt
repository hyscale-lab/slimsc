Okay, so Alice and Bob are playing this game with a stack of n tokens. They take turns removing either 1 or 4 tokens, and the person who takes the last token wins. I need to find how many positive integers n ≤ 2024 make Bob the winner if he plays optimally, regardless of Alice's moves.

Hmm, let me think. Since Alice goes first, Bob's only chance to win is if the starting position n is a losing position for Alice. So, I need to figure out for which n Alice is in a losing position, meaning no matter what she does, Bob can force a win.

This seems like a classic game theory problem, probably involving the concept of winning and losing positions. Maybe I can model this using dynamic programming or by finding a pattern.

Let's consider small values of n and see if we can find a pattern.

For n=1:
Alice can take 1 token and win. So, Bob can't win here. So n=1 is a winning position for Alice.

n=2:
Alice can take 1 token, leaving 1 for Bob. Then Bob can take that 1 and win. Wait, no—if Alice takes 1, leaving 1, then Bob can take the last one and win. So n=2 is a losing position for Alice? Wait, no. If Alice is faced with n=2, she can take 1, leaving 1 for Bob, who then wins. So n=2 is a winning position for Alice because she can take 1 and make Bob take the last one.

Wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let's re-examine.

Actually, for each n, if there exists a move that leads the opponent into a losing position, then the current player can win. If all possible moves lead to the opponent being in a winning position, then the current position is losing.

So let's define a position as a winning position if the current player can force a win, and a losing position otherwise.

Base cases:
n=0: no tokens, so the player to move loses. So n=0 is a losing position.

n=1: current player takes 1 and wins. So n=1 is winning.

n=2: current player can take 1, leaving 1 which is a winning position for the opponent. Or take 4, but can't because n=2 <4. So only option is to leave 1, which is a win
