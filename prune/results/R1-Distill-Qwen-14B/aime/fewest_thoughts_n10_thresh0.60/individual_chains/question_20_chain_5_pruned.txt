Okay, so I have this problem here about placing chips on a 5x5 grid. Let me try to understand it step by step. 

The problem says there are 25 white chips and 25 black chips, but we can only use some of them. Each cell can have at most one chip. The main conditions are about the colors in each row and column and making sure that adding another chip would break these conditions. Hmm, okay.

First, let me break down the conditions:

1. Each cell has at most one chip. That's straightforward, no two chips in the same cell.

2. All chips in the same row must be the same color. Similarly, all chips in the same column must be the same color. So, each row is either all white, all black, or empty. Same for each column.

3. Any additional chip placed would violate the previous two conditions. So, the configuration is maximal in some sense. That probably means that every empty cell is adjacent (either in its row or column) to a cell that's already filled in a way that adding another chip there would cause a conflict.

Wait, not necessarily adjacent. Because the condition is about the row and column. So, if a row has some white chips, then the entire row is white or empty. Similarly for columns. So, for any empty cell, if we try to place a chip there, it would have to be the same color as the entire row, but the entire row is already white or black, but if it's empty, then placing a chip there would require the entire row to be that color, but the column might have a different color.

Wait, no, maybe not. Let me think again. Each row is either all white, all black, or empty. Similarly for each column. So, for a cell to be empty, it means that either its row is empty or its column is empty, or it's part of a row and column that are both non-empty but of different colors. Hmm, but if a row is non-empty, then all its cells must be the same color. So, if a cell is empty, its row must be empty or its column must be empty, or the row is of a different color than the column.

Wait, no. Let me think differently. Suppose a cell is empty. Then, if the row is non-empty, the row's color is fixed. If the column is non-empty, the column's color is fixed.
