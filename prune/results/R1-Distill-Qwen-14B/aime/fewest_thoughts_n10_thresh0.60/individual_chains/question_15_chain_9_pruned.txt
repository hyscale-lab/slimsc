Okay, so I've got this problem here about counting the number of paths on an 8x8 grid. The paths are of length 16, starting from the lower left corner and going to the upper right corner. The catch is that these paths must change direction exactly four times. Hmm, that seems a bit tricky, but let's break it down.

First off, I know that in a grid, moving from the lower left to the upper right means I have to move right and up. For an 8x8 grid, you have to move 8 steps right and 8 steps up, totaling 16 steps. So each path is a sequence of rights (R) and ups (U), arranged in some order. The total number of such paths without any restrictions is the combination of 16 steps taken 8 at a time for R (or U). That's C(16,8), which is 12870. But here, we have a restriction: exactly four direction changes.

Wait, what does it mean to change direction exactly four times? Well, every time the path switches from moving right to up or from up to right, that's a direction change. So, for example, if the path starts with a series of rights, then switches to ups, then back to rights, and so on. Each switch is a direction change.

So if we have exactly four direction changes, how does that affect the structure of the path? Let's think about it. Each time we change direction, it alternates between R and U. So starting with R, the path would be R... U... R... U... and so on. Similarly, starting with U would be U... R... U... R..., etc. But wait, since we start at the lower left and end at the upper right, the path must start with R and end with U, or start with U and end with R? No, actually, any combination is possible as long as the total number of R and U steps is 8 each. Hmm, but perhaps the starting direction will affect the number of direction changes.

Wait, maybe not. Because regardless of starting direction, the number of direction changes would be determined by how many times we switch between R and U.

Hold on, let's model this. If we have a path that changes direction exactly four times, how many segments of R and U does that create? Each direction change creates a new segment. So starting with
