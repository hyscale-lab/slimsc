Okay, so I've got this problem about residents in Aimeville and the things they own. Let me try to figure this out step by step. Hmm, it seems like a problem involving sets and maybe using the principle of inclusion-exclusion. I remember that from my math class, but I need to recall exactly how it works.

Alright, let's break down the information given. There are 900 residents in total. Each resident owns a bag of candy hearts, so that's a given for everyone. Then, some own a diamond ring, some own a set of golf clubs, and some own a garden spade. Let me note down the numbers:

- Diamond ring owners: 195
- Golf clubs owners: 367
- Garden spade owners: 562
- Everyone owns candy hearts.

Additionally, it's given that 437 residents own exactly two of these things, and 234 own exactly three. The question is asking for the number of residents who own all four of these items, which would be those owning a diamond ring, golf clubs, garden spade, and candy hearts.

Wait, but wait, since everyone owns a bag of candy hearts, that means that in the context of this problem, the candy hearts are something that every resident has. So, when considering overlaps, the candy hearts are always included. That might complicate things a bit, but I think I can handle it.

I remember that when dealing with multiple sets, the inclusion-exclusion principle helps to find the total number of elements in the union of the sets. The formula for four sets would be a bit complicated, but in this case, since candy hearts are universal, maybe it can simplify the problem.

Wait, actually, the problem is about ownership of four items: diamond ring, golf clubs, garden spade, and candy hearts. But candy hearts are owned by all 900 residents, so everyone has that. So, when we talk about someone owning exactly two or exactly three things, we're talking about the other three items. Because if someone owns exactly two, those two plus candy hearts would make three. Similarly, someone owning exactly three would have those three plus candy hearts, but that's four. Hmm, maybe not. Wait, no. Let me think.

No, actually, when considering exactly two things, it's out of the four items. But since candy hearts are always present, any ownership count
