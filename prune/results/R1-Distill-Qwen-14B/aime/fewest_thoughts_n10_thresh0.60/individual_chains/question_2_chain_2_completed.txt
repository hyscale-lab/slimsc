Okay, so I've got this geometry problem here, and I need to find OC², where C is a specific point on segment AB. The points given are O at (0,0), A at (1/2, 0), and B at (0, sqrt(3)/2). There's this family of segments F, which are all unit-length segments PQ in the first quadrant, with P on the x-axis and Q on the y-axis. The point C is unique in that it's on AB but not on any other segment from F except AB itself. Then I need to find OC² and express it as a fraction p/q, then find p + q.

Alright, let's break this down. First, I should visualize the setup. We have point O at the origin, A is on the x-axis at (1/2, 0), and B is on the y-axis at (0, sqrt(3)/2). So, segment AB connects these two points. The family F consists of segments PQ where P is on the x-axis, Q is on the y-axis, and PQ has length 1. Each such PQ is a unit segment in the first quadrant, stretching from the x-axis to the y-axis.

Now, point C is on AB but doesn't lie on any other segment from F except AB. So, C is the only point on AB that's not shared with any other PQ in F. That suggests that C is a point where AB is tangent to some envelope formed by the family F. Maybe the envelope of all these PQ segments forms a curve, and AB is tangent to that curve at point C.

Wait, the envelope of a family of curves is a curve that is tangent to each member of the family at some point. But here, we have a family of line segments, not curves. Hmm, but maybe each PQ is a straight line, so the envelope might be another curve, and AB is tangent to this envelope at point C. So, C would be the point of tangency.

So, perhaps I need to find the envelope of the family F and then find where AB is tangent to this envelope. The point C would then be the point of tangency, and I can compute OC² from there.

Alright, let me try to parameterize the segments PQ in F. Let's let P be a point on the x-axis at (p, 0) and Q be a point on the y-axis at (0, q). The length of PQ is 1, so by the distance formula:

sqrt[(p - 0)^2 + (0 - q)^2] = 1
Which simplifies to sqrt(p² + q²) = 1
So, p² + q² = 1.

So, each segment PQ is determined by p and q such that p² + q² = 1, with p, q >= 0 because we're in the first quadrant.

Now, the equation of the line PQ. Since it's a straight line connecting (p, 0) and (0, q), its equation can be written in intercept form as:

x/p + y/q = 1.

Alternatively, rearranged as:

(q)x + (p)y = pq.

So, the family of lines is given by q x + p y = p q, with p² + q² = 1.

Hmm, perhaps I can express this in terms of a single parameter. Since p² + q² = 1, maybe I can parameterize p and q using an angle θ. Let me let p = cos θ and q = sin θ, since cos² θ + sin² θ = 1. That way, I can write the equation of PQ as:

sin θ x + cos θ y = cos θ sin θ.

So, the equation becomes:

sin θ x + cos θ y = (1/2) sin 2θ.

Wait, because cos θ sin θ is (1/2) sin 2θ. Hmm, perhaps that's a useful identity.

Alternatively, maybe I can write it as:

sin θ x + cos θ y = (1/2) sin 2θ.

Wait, or perhaps I can write it as:

sin θ x + cos θ y = (1/2) sin 2θ.

But maybe that's complicating things. Alternatively, perhaps I can leave it as:

sin θ x + cos θ y = cos θ sin θ.

So, the equation of each PQ is sin θ x + cos θ y = cos θ sin θ.

Now, to find the envelope of this family of lines, I can use the method for finding the envelope of a family of curves. The envelope is found by solving the system:

F(x, y, θ) = sin θ x + cos θ y - cos θ sin θ = 0,

and

dF/dθ = 0.

So, let's compute dF/dθ.

So, F = sin θ x + cos θ y - cos θ sin θ.

Compute derivative of F with respect to θ:

dF/dθ = cos θ x - sin θ y - [ -sin θ sin θ + cos θ (-cos θ) ].

Wait, let me compute each term:

d/dθ [sin θ x] = x cos θ,

d/dθ [cos θ y] = -y sin θ,

d/dθ [ -cos θ sin θ ] = derivative of -cos θ sin θ.

Using product rule: derivative of -cos θ sin θ is -[ -sin θ sin θ + cos θ (-cos θ) ].

Wait, let's compute it step by step:

Let me compute d/dθ [cos θ sin θ]:

It's derivative of cos θ is -sin θ times sin θ plus cos θ times derivative of sin θ which is cos θ.

So: -sin θ * sin θ + cos θ * cos θ = -sin² θ + cos² θ.

Therefore, d/dθ [ -cos θ sin θ ] = - [ -sin² θ + cos² θ ] = sin² θ - cos² θ.

Wait, but perhaps I should double-check that.

Wait, F = sin θ x + cos θ y - (1/2) sin 2θ, since cos θ sin θ is (1/2) sin 2θ.

So, dF/dθ = x cos θ - y sin θ - (1/2)(2 cos 2θ) ) = x cos θ - y sin θ - cos 2θ.

Wait, that seems simpler because d/dθ (sin 2θ) is 2 cos 2θ, so the derivative of -(1/2) sin 2θ is -(1/2)(2 cos 2θ) = -cos 2θ.

So, dF/dθ = x cos θ - y sin θ - cos 2θ.

So, the system to solve is:

1. sin θ x + cos θ y = (1/2) sin 2θ,

2. x cos θ - y sin θ - cos 2θ = 0.

So, we have two equations:

Equation (1): sin θ x + cos θ y = (1/2)(2 sin θ cos θ) = sin θ cos θ.

Equation (2): x cos θ - y sin θ = cos 2θ.

Hmm, perhaps I can write equation (1) as:

sin θ x + cos θ y = sin θ cos θ.

And equation (2) as:

x cos θ - y sin θ = cos 2θ.

Hmm, maybe I can solve for x and y from these two equations.

Let me write equations (1) and (2) as:

(1) sin θ x + cos θ y = sin θ cos θ,

(2) cos θ x - sin θ y = cos 2θ.

Let me arrange them as a system:

[ sin θ   cos θ ] [x]   = [ sin θ cos θ ]

[ cos θ  -sin θ ] [y]     [ cos 2θ      ]

Wait, actually, equation (2) is cos θ x - sin θ y = cos 2θ.

So, let me write this as a linear system:

a11 x + a12 y = b1,

a21 x + a22 y = b2,

where a11 = sin θ,

a12 = cos θ,

a21 = cos θ,

a22 = -sin θ,

b1 = sin θ cos θ,

b2 = cos 2θ.

We can solve this system using Cramer's rule or matrix inversion. Let's compute the determinant of the coefficient matrix:

D = a11 a22 - a12 a21 = (sin θ)(-sin θ) - (cos θ)(cos θ) = -sin² θ - cos² θ = - (sin² θ + cos² θ) = -1.

So, the determinant is -1. That's good because it's non-zero, so a unique solution exists.

So, using Cramer's rule:

x = ( |b1 a12; b2 a22| ) / D,

y = ( |a11 b1; a21 b2| ) / D.

Wait, let me write down the determinants properly.

For x, replace the first column with the constants:

x = (b1 * a22 - a12 * b2) / D,

Similarly for y:

y = (a11 * b2 - b1 * a21) / D.

So, let's compute x first.

x = [ b1 * a22 - a12 * b2 ] / D,

= [ (sin θ cos θ)(-sin θ) - (cos θ)(cos 2θ) ] / (-1).

Simplify numerator:

= [ -sin² θ cos θ - cos θ cos 2θ ].

Factor out -cos θ:

= -cos θ [ sin² θ + cos 2θ ].

Hmm, let me compute sin² θ + cos 2θ.

We know that cos 2θ = 1 - 2 sin² θ, so sin² θ = (1 - cos 2θ)/2.

Substituting into sin² θ + cos 2θ:

= (1 - cos 2θ)/2 + cos 2θ

= 1/2 - (cos 2θ)/2 + cos 2θ

= 1/2 + (cos 2θ)/2

= (1 + cos 2θ)/2.

So, the numerator becomes:

-cos θ * [ (1 + cos 2θ)/2 ].

So,

x = [ -cos θ * (1 + cos 2θ)/2 ] / (-1) = [ -cos θ (1 + cos 2θ)/2 ] / (-1).

The negatives cancel, giving:

x = [ cos θ (1 + cos 2θ) ] / 2.

Similarly, let's compute y.

y = [ a11 * b2 - b1 * a21 ] / D,

where a11 = sin θ,

b2 = cos 2θ,

b1 = sin θ cos θ,

a21 = cos θ.

So,

y = [ sin θ * cos 2θ - sin θ cos θ * cos θ ] / (-1).

Simplify numerator:

= [ sin θ cos 2θ - sin θ cos² θ ].

Factor out sin θ:

= sin θ [ cos 2θ - cos² θ ].

Hmm, can we simplify cos 2θ - cos² θ?

We know that cos 2θ = 2 cos² θ - 1, so substituting:

cos 2θ - cos² θ = (2 cos² θ - 1) - cos² θ = cos² θ - 1 = -sin² θ.

So, the numerator becomes sin θ * (-sin² θ) = -sin³ θ.

Thus,

y = [ -sin³ θ ] / (-1) = sin³ θ.

So, putting it all together, the envelope is parameterized by θ as:

x = [ cos θ (1 + cos 2θ) ] / 2,

y = sin³ θ.

Wait, let me see if I can simplify x further.

We have:

x = cos θ (1 + cos 2θ) / 2.

But 1 + cos 2θ = 2 cos² θ, so:

x = cos θ * 2 cos² θ / 2 = cos θ * cos² θ = cos³ θ.

Wait, that's a simplification! So, x = cos³ θ.

And y = sin³ θ.

So, the envelope is given parametrically by x = cos³ θ, y = sin³ θ. That's the astroid curve, I think. The astroid is a type of hypocycloid, often given by x = cos³ θ, y = sin³ θ.

So, the envelope of the family F is the astroid x^(2/3) + y^(2/3) = 1, because if x = cos³ θ, then x^(1/3) = cos θ, and similarly y^(1/3) = sin θ. So, (x^(1/3))² + (y^(1/3))² = cos² θ + sin² θ = 1. So, x^(2/3) + y^(2/3) = 1.

So, the envelope is the astroid x^(2/3) + y^(2/3) = 1.

Now, the problem says that AB is a line segment from A(1/2, 0) to B(0, sqrt(3)/2). So, AB is a line in the first quadrant.

We need to find the point C on AB that lies on the astroid and is the point where AB is tangent to the astroid. Because C is the only point on AB that's on the envelope (the astroid), so it's the point of tangency.

So, AB is the line connecting (1/2, 0) and (0, sqrt(3)/2). Let me find the equation of AB.

The slope of AB is (sqrt(3)/2 - 0)/(0 - 1/2) = (sqrt(3)/2) / (-1/2) = -sqrt(3).

So, the equation of AB is y = -sqrt(3) x + b. To find b, plug in point A: (1/2, 0):

0 = -sqrt(3)*(1/2) + b => b = sqrt(3)/2.

So, equation of AB is y = -sqrt(3) x + sqrt(3)/2.

Now, we need to find the point C where this line is tangent to the astroid x^(2/3) + y^(2/3) = 1.

The condition for a line y = m x + c to be tangent to the astroid x^(2/3) + y^(2/3) = 1 is that the distance from the origin to the line is 1/(sqrt(m² + 1))^(1/3). Hmm, wait, I'm not sure about that. Alternatively, maybe I can use the condition that the system has exactly one solution, so the line intersects the astroid at exactly one point.

But perhaps a better approach is to substitute y from the line into the astroid equation and set the discriminant to zero for a single solution.

So, substituting y = -sqrt(3) x + sqrt(3)/2 into the astroid equation x^(2/3) + y^(2/3) = 1.

Let me write y as:

y = -sqrt(3) x + sqrt(3)/2.

Let me let t = x^(1/3), s = y^(1/3). Then the astroid equation is t² + s² = 1.

But perhaps it's better to work with the original variables. Let's proceed.

So, substitute y into the astroid equation:

x^(2/3) + [ -sqrt(3) x + sqrt(3)/2 ]^(2/3) = 1.

This looks messy, but maybe we can make a substitution. Let me set u = x. Then the equation becomes:

u^(2/3) + [ -sqrt(3) u + sqrt(3)/2 ]^(2/3) = 1.

Hmm, this might not be easy to solve. Alternatively, perhaps I can parameterize the astroid and AB, then find where they meet with a certain condition.

Wait, the astroid is x^(2/3) + y^(2/3) = 1. Let me parameterize the astroid as:

x = cos³ θ,

y = sin³ θ,

for θ in [0, π/2], since we're in the first quadrant.

Now, the line AB is y = -sqrt(3) x + sqrt(3)/2.

So, substituting the parameterization of the astroid into the line equation:

sin³ θ = -sqrt(3) cos³ θ + sqrt(3)/2.

Let me rearrange this:

sin³ θ + sqrt(3) cos³ θ = sqrt(3)/2.

Hmm, maybe I can factor this or find θ that satisfies this equation.

Alternatively, perhaps I can write everything in terms of sin θ and cos θ.

Let me let s = sin θ, c = cos θ. Then:

s³ + sqrt(3) c³ = sqrt(3)/2.

Hmm, and we also know that s² + c² = 1.

I need to solve for s and c such that s³ + sqrt(3) c³ = sqrt(3)/2 and s² + c² = 1.

This seems tricky, but maybe I can find a substitution or find a relation between s and c.

Alternatively, perhaps I can express s in terms of c or vice versa.

From s² + c² = 1, s = sqrt(1 - c²). But substituting into the first equation might complicate things.

Wait, maybe I can factor the equation s³ + sqrt(3) c³.

Hmm, s³ + sqrt(3) c³ = sqrt(3)/2.

Let me factor it as:

s³ + (sqrt(3) c)^3 = (sqrt(3)/2).

Wait, because (a + b)^3 = a^3 + b^3 + 3a² b + 3a b². Hmm, but I don't see an immediate way to factor this.

Alternatively, perhaps I can write this as:

s^3 + (sqrt(3) c)^3 = (sqrt(3)/2).

Let me let a = s and b = sqrt(3) c.

Then, a³ + b³ = sqrt(3)/2.

And from s² + c² = 1, we have a² / s² = c² / (1 - s²). Wait, maybe that's not helpful.

Alternatively, since b = sqrt(3) c, then c = b / sqrt(3).

So, s² + (b^2)/(3) = 1.

But I'm not sure if this substitution helps.

Alternatively, maybe we can let u = s / c, so s = u c.

Then, from s² + c² = 1, (u² c²) + c² = 1 => c² (u² + 1) = 1 => c = 1 / sqrt(u² + 1).

Similarly, s = u / sqrt(u² + 1).

Now, substitute into the first equation:

s³ + sqrt(3) c³ = sqrt(3)/2.

Expressed in terms of u:

(u / sqrt(u² + 1))³ + sqrt(3) (1 / sqrt(u² + 1))³ = sqrt(3)/2.

Simplify each term:

= u³ / (u² + 1)^(3/2) + sqrt(3) / (u² + 1)^(3/2).

Factor out 1/(u² + 1)^(3/2):

= [u³ + sqrt(3)] / (u² + 1)^(3/2).

Set equal to sqrt(3)/2:

[ u³ + sqrt(3) ] / (u² + 1)^(3/2) = sqrt(3)/2.

Cross-multiplying:

2 [u³ + sqrt(3)] = sqrt(3) (u² + 1)^(3/2).

Hmm, this looks complicated, but maybe I can square both sides to eliminate the square root.

Wait, but before squaring, let me think if there's a smarter substitution.

Wait, perhaps u is a multiple of 1/sqrt(3) or something. Let me try a substitution: Let me set u = t / sqrt(3). So, u = t / sqrt(3). Then, let's see:

u³ = t³ / (3 sqrt(3)),

sqrt(3) u³ = t³ / (3 sqrt(3)) * sqrt(3) ) = t³ / 3,

Similarly, u² = t² / 3,

u² + 1 = (t² + 3)/3,

so (u² + 1)^(3/2) = [ (t² + 3)/3 ]^(3/2).

Hmm, maybe this substitution could help.

Wait, let's proceed.

So, substituting u = t / sqrt(3):

Left side:

2 [ (t^3)/(3 sqrt(3)) + sqrt(3) ] = 2 [ (t^3 + 9 )/(3 sqrt(3)) ) ].

Right side:

sqrt(3) * [ (t^2 + 3)/3 ]^(3/2).

Hmm, perhaps this isn't the best path. Alternatively, maybe I can let u = 1, but that would give s = c, which might not satisfy.

Alternatively, perhaps I can consider that the point C is on AB and on the astroid, and also that AB is tangent to the astroid at C. So, the line AB is tangent to the astroid at point C, so the derivative of the astroid at C should be equal to the slope of AB.

So, let's compute the derivative of the astroid at point C.

The astroid is x^(2/3) + y^(2/3) = 1.

Differentiate both sides with respect to x:

(2/3) x^(-1/3) + (2/3) y^(-1/3) dy/dx = 0.

Solving for dy/dx:

dy/dx = - [ (2/3) x^(-1/3) ] / [ (2/3) y^(-1/3) ) ] = - [ x^(-1/3) / y^(-1/3) ) ] = - (y^(1/3) / x^(1/3)).

So, the slope of the tangent to the astroid at point (x, y) is - (y^(1/3) / x^(1/3)).

But the slope of AB is -sqrt(3). So, at point C, the slope of the astroid is equal to -sqrt(3).

So,

- (y^(1/3) / x^(1/3)) = -sqrt(3),

Simplify:

y^(1/3) / x^(1/3) = sqrt(3),

So,

y^(1/3) = sqrt(3) x^(1/3),

Cubing both sides:

y = (3)^(3/2) x,

Which is y = 3*sqrt(3) x.

Wait, but that's the equation of a line with slope 3*sqrt(3). But the line AB has slope -sqrt(3). Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the differentiation.

Wait, let's double-check the differentiation of the astroid.

The astroid equation is x^(2/3) + y^(2/3) = 1.

Differentiating both sides with respect to x:

(2/3) x^(-1/3) + (2/3) y^(-1/3) dy/dx = 0.

So, bringing the first term to the other side:

(2/3) y^(-1/3) dy/dx = - (2/3) x^(-1/3).

Divide both sides by (2/3) y^(-1/3):

dy/dx = - [ x^(-1/3) / y^(-1/3) ) ] = - [ y^(1/3) / x^(1/3) ).

Yes, that's correct.

So, the slope of the astroid at point C is - (y^(1/3) / x^(1/3)).

And this slope is equal to the slope of AB, which is -sqrt(3).

So,

- (y^(1/3) / x^(1/3)) = -sqrt(3),

Which simplifies to y^(1/3) / x^(1/3) = sqrt(3).

So,

y^(1/3) = sqrt(3) x^(1/3),

Which implies y = (sqrt(3))^3 x = 3*sqrt(3) x.

Wait, that's a line with slope 3*sqrt(3), but AB has slope -sqrt(3). That seems contradictory. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, the line AB is y = -sqrt(3) x + sqrt(3)/2. So, it's a line with negative slope.

Wait, maybe I got the equation of the astroid's tangent slope correctly, but perhaps I need to consider the point C lying on both the astroid and AB, and the slope of the astroid at C being equal to the slope of AB.

So, let's proceed.

We have:

1. y^(1/3) / x^(1/3) = sqrt(3),

so y = (sqrt(3))^3 x = 3*sqrt(3) x.

2. Also, point C lies on AB: y = -sqrt(3) x + sqrt(3)/2.

So, substituting y from equation 1 into equation 2:

3*sqrt(3) x = -sqrt(3) x + sqrt(3)/2.

Let's solve for x.

3*sqrt(3) x + sqrt(3) x = sqrt(3)/2,

sqrt(3) x (3 + 1) = sqrt(3)/2,

sqrt(3) x * 4 = sqrt(3)/2,

Divide both sides by sqrt(3):

4 x = 1/2,

So, x = (1/2) / 4 = 1/8.

So, x = 1/8.

Then, from equation 1, y = 3*sqrt(3) * (1/8) = 3*sqrt(3)/8.

So, point C is at (1/8, 3*sqrt(3)/8).

Wait, but let's check if this point lies on the astroid x^(2/3) + y^(2/3) = 1.

Compute x^(2/3) = (1/8)^(2/3) = (1^(2/3))/(8^(2/3)) = 1 / (4).

Similarly, y^(2/3) = (3*sqrt(3)/8)^(2/3).

Let me compute this:

First, 3*sqrt(3) = 3^(3/2).

So, y = 3^(3/2)/8.

Thus, y^(2/3) = [3^(3/2)/8]^(2/3) = (3^(3/2))^(2/3) / (8)^(2/3).

= 3^( (3/2)*(2/3) ) / (8^(2/3)).

= 3^1 / (4),

= 3/4.

So, x^(2/3) + y^(2/3) = 1/4 + 3/4 = 1.

Yes, it satisfies the astroid equation. So, point C is (1/8, 3*sqrt(3)/8).

Now, we need to find OC², which is (1/8)^2 + (3*sqrt(3)/8)^2.

Calculate:

(1/8)^2 = 1/64,

(3*sqrt(3)/8)^2 = 9*3 / 64 = 27/64.

So, OC² = 1/64 + 27/64 = 28/64 = 7/16.

Wait, 1 + 27 = 28, so 28/64 reduces to 7/16. So, 7 and 16 are coprime, so OC² = 7/16, and p + q = 7 + 16 = 23.

But wait, hold on. The problem states that C is on AB and is the unique point not lying on any other segment from F except AB. But in our calculation, we found point C at (1/8, 3*sqrt(3)/8). Let me verify if this point is indeed on AB.

AB's equation is y = -sqrt(3)x + sqrt(3)/2.

Substitute x = 1/8:

y = -sqrt(3)*(1/8) + sqrt(3)/2 = (-sqrt(3)/8) + (4 sqrt(3)/8) = (3 sqrt(3))/8.

Which matches the y-coordinate we found, so yes, point C is correctly on AB.

Hmm, but wait, when I calculated the envelope, I found the astroid, and then found the point where AB is tangent to the astroid. So, point C is (1/8, 3√3/8), and OC² is 7/16.

Wait, but let me check my earlier step where I set the slope of the astroid at C to be equal to the slope of AB. I think that's correct because if AB is tangent to the astroid at C, then their slopes must be equal at that point.

But when I calculated the slope from the astroid's equation, I got dy/dx = - (y^(1/3)/x^(1/3)), which we set equal to -sqrt(3).

But when I solved for y in terms of x, I got y = 3 sqrt(3) x, which is a line with positive slope. But AB has a negative slope. Hmm, that seems contradictory.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the sign when equating the slopes. Let me check.

We have:

dy/dx (astroid at point C) = - (y^(1/3)/x^(1/3)).

And the slope of AB is -sqrt(3).

So,

- (y^(1/3)/x^(1/3)) = -sqrt(3).

Multiply both sides by -1:

y^(1/3)/x^(1/3) = sqrt(3).

Which implies y = (sqrt(3))^3 x = 3 sqrt(3) x.

Wait, but AB is y = -sqrt(3) x + sqrt(3)/2, which is a line with negative slope. So, how can the tangent line at C on the astroid have a positive slope?

Hmm, that suggests that perhaps I made an error in the differentiation or in the setup. Let me re-examine the differentiation step.

The astroid equation is x^(2/3) + y^(2/3) = 1.

Differentiating with respect to x:

(2/3) x^(-1/3) + (2/3) y^(-1/3) dy/dx = 0.

So,

(2/3) y^(-1/3) dy/dx = - (2/3) x^(-1/3).

Divide both sides by (2/3) y^(-1/3):

dy/dx = - [ x^(-1/3) / y^(-1/3) ) ] = - (y^(1/3) / x^(1/3)).

Yes, that's correct. So, the slope is negative because it's negative y^(1/3) over positive x^(1/3), but that depends on the signs of y and x. Since we're in the first quadrant, x and y are positive, so y^(1/3) and x^(1/3) are positive, so dy/dx is negative. Which aligns with the slope of AB being negative.

So, earlier, when I wrote y^(1/3)/x^(1/3) = sqrt(3), that's correct, leading to y = 3 sqrt(3) x, which is a line with positive slope. But AB has a negative slope, so perhaps I missed a negative sign in the equation.

Wait, let me think again. The slope of the astroid is dy/dx = - (y^(1/3)/x^(1/3)).

We have this equal to the slope of AB, which is -sqrt(3).

So,

- (y^(1/3)/x^(1/3)) = -sqrt(3).

Multiply both sides by -1:

y^(1/3)/x^(1/3) = sqrt(3).

So,

y = (sqrt(3))^3 x = 3 sqrt(3) x.

Wait, but that's a line with positive slope, while AB has a negative slope. So, how can this be?

Wait, perhaps there's a miscalculation. Let me check.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the sign when equating the slopes. Let me think again.

The slope of the astroid at point C is equal to the slope of AB.

Slope of AB is -sqrt(3).

Slope of astroid at C is - (y^(1/3) / x^(1/3)).

So,

- (y^(1/3)/x^(1/3)) = -sqrt(3),

Which simplifies to (y^(1/3)/x^(1/3)) = sqrt(3).

Which gives y = (sqrt(3))^3 x = 3 sqrt(3) x.

But AB is y = -sqrt(3) x + sqrt(3)/2.

So, substituting y from the astroid's tangent line into AB's equation:

3 sqrt(3) x = -sqrt(3) x + sqrt(3)/2.

Adding sqrt(3) x to both sides:

4 sqrt(3) x = sqrt(3)/2,

Divide both sides by sqrt(3):

4 x = 1/2,

x = 1/8,

Then y = 3 sqrt(3) * (1/8) = 3 sqrt(3)/8.

So, yes, the point C is at (1/8, 3 sqrt(3)/8).

So, even though the tangent line to the astroid at C has a positive slope, the line AB is this tangent line. Wait, no, AB is a different line. Wait, no, the astroid's tangent at C is AB. So, AB is the line that is tangent to the astroid at point C. So, the slope of AB is equal to the slope of the astroid at C, which is -sqrt(3). So, when I set the slope of astroid at C to be -sqrt(3), the calculation leads to y = 3 sqrt(3) x, but this is only the point where the tangent line meets the astroid.

Wait, perhaps I confused the slope of AB with the slope of the astroid. Let me re-examine.

AB has equation y = -sqrt(3) x + sqrt(3)/2, so its slope is -sqrt(3).

The astroid at point C has slope equal to -sqrt(3), so when I set dy/dx = -sqrt(3), I get the equation of the tangent line at C, which should be AB.

Wait, but earlier, when I substituted, I got point C at (1/8, 3 sqrt(3)/8). But when I plug this into AB's equation, it works. So, perhaps the confusion arises because the tangent line at C is AB, which indeed has a negative slope, but the relation dy/dx = - (y^(1/3)/x^(1/3)) leads to a positive ratio because both x and y are positive.

Wait, maybe it's correct because the slope of the tangent line is negative, which comes from the negative in the derivative, so the ratio y^(1/3)/x^(1/3) is positive, but with the negative from the derivative, it gives the negative slope.

So, perhaps all the steps are correct, and the point C is indeed at (1/8, 3 sqrt(3)/8).

Then, OC² is (1/8)^2 + (3 sqrt(3)/8)^2 = (1 + 27)/64 = 28/64 = 7/16.

So, p = 7, q = 16, p + q = 23.

Wait, but let me verify again. I think I made a mistake because when I found the point C at (1/8, 3 sqrt(3)/8), it's on AB, but when I check the envelope, the astroid is x^(2/3) + y^(2/3) = 1, and substituting C's coordinates:

(1/8)^(2/3) + (3 sqrt(3)/8)^(2/3) = (1/4) + (3/4) = 1, so it's correct.

But wait, the problem statement says that C is on AB and is the only point on AB that doesn't lie on any other segment from F except AB. So, perhaps there's another way to approach this problem without using the envelope.

Alternatively, perhaps I can parameterize the family F and find where AB only intersects F at C.

Each segment PQ in F is from (p,0) to (0,q), with p² + q² = 1.

The equation of PQ is x/p + y/q = 1.

We can write this as q x + p y = p q.

We can write this as y = (-q/p) x + q.

Now, AB is the line y = -sqrt(3) x + sqrt(3)/2.

The point C is the only point on AB that lies on any PQ from F, but since C is unique, it must be the point where AB is tangent to the envelope, which is the astroid.

So, the earlier approach was correct.

Therefore, OC² is 7/16, so p + q = 23.


To solve the problem, we first identify the family of segments $\overline{PQ}$ as unit-length segments in the first quadrant with $P$ on the $x$-axis and $Q$ on the $y$-axis. Each segment $\overline{PQ}$ can be parameterized as $x = \cos^3 \theta$, $y = \sin^3 \theta$, forming the astroid curve $x^{2/3} + y^{2/3} = 1$.

The line segment $\overline{AB}$ connects points $A\left(\frac{1}{2}, 0\right)$ and $B\left(0, \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right)$ with the equation $y = -\sqrt{3}x + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}$. To find the unique point $C$ on $\overline{AB}$ that lies on the astroid and is tangent to it, we set the slope of the astroid at $C$ equal to the slope of $\overline{AB}$, which is $-\sqrt{3}$.

By solving the system of equations derived from the astroid and the line, we find that the point $C$ is at $\left(\frac{1}{8}, \frac{3\sqrt{3}}{8}\right)$. Calculating $OC^2$ gives:

\[
OC^2 = \left(\frac{1}{8}\right)^2 + \left(\frac{3\sqrt{3}}{8}\right)^2 = \frac{1}{64} + \frac{27}{64} = \frac{28}{64} = \frac{7}{16}.
\]

Thus, $p = 7$ and $q = 16$, leading to $p + q = 23$.

$\boxed{23}$
