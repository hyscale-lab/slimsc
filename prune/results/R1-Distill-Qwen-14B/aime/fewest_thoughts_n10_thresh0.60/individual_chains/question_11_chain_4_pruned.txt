Okay, so I have this problem here: I need to find the largest possible real part of the expression \[(75 + 117i)z + \frac{96 + 144i}{z}\], where \( z \) is a complex number with \( |z| = 4 \). Hmm, that sounds a bit tricky, but let me try to break it down step by step.

First, I remember that since \( |z| = 4 \), \( z \) lies on a circle in the complex plane with radius 4. That might be useful later on. Also, \( z \) can be written in polar form, right? So, let me represent \( z \) as \( z = 4e^{i\theta} \), where \( \theta \) is the argument of \( z \). That could simplify things because multiplying and dividing complex numbers in polar form is easier.

So, substituting \( z = 4e^{i\theta} \) into the expression, I get:

\[
(75 + 117i) \cdot 4e^{i\theta} + \frac{96 + 144i}{4e^{i\theta}}
\]

Let me compute each part separately.

First part: \( (75 + 117i) \cdot 4e^{i\theta} \)
Multiply 75 and 117 by 4:
75 * 4 = 300
117 * 4 = 468
So, this becomes \( 300 + 468i \) multiplied by \( e^{i\theta} \).

Second part: \( \frac{96 + 144i}{4e^{i\theta}} \)
Divide 96 and 144 by 4:
96 / 4 = 24
144 / 4 = 36
So, this becomes \( 24 + 36i \) divided by \( e^{i\theta} \).

Wait, actually, division by \( e^{i\theta} \) is the same as multiplying by \( e^{-i\theta} \). So, \( \frac{24 + 36i}{e^{i\theta}} = (24 + 36i)e^{-i\theta} \).

So, putting it all together, the entire expression becomes:

\[
(300 + 468i)e^{i\theta} + (24 + 36i)e^{-i\theta}
\]

Hmm, that looks a bit complicated, but maybe we can express this in terms of cosine and sine using Euler's formula. Euler's formula says that \( e^{i\theta} = \cos\theta + i\sin\theta \), and \( e^{-i\theta} = \cos\theta - i\sin\theta \). So, substituting these in:

First term: \( (300 + 468i)(\cos\theta + i\sin\theta) \)
Second term: \( (24 + 36i)(\cos\theta - i\sin\theta) \)

Let me compute each term separately.

Expanding the first term:

\( 300\cos\theta + 300i\sin\theta + 468i\cos\theta + 468i^2\sin\theta \)

But \( i^2 = -1 \), so the last term becomes \( -468\sin\theta \).

So, combining like terms:

Real parts: \( 300\cos\theta - 468\sin\theta \)
Imaginary parts: \( 300\sin\theta + 468\cos\theta \)

Similarly, expanding the second term:

\( 24\cos\theta - 24i\sin\theta + 36i\cos\theta - 36i^2\sin\theta \)

Again, \( i^2 = -1 \), so the last term becomes \( +36\sin\theta \).

So, combining like terms:

Real parts: \( 24\cos\theta + 36\sin\theta \)
Imaginary parts: \( -24\sin\theta + 36\cos\theta \)

Now, adding both terms together:

Real parts from first term: \( 300\cos\theta - 468\sin\theta \)
Real parts from second term: \( 24\cos\theta + 36\sin\theta \)
Total real part: \( (300 + 24)\cos\theta + (-468 + 36)\sin\theta \)
Which simplifies to: \( 324\cos\theta - 432\sin\theta \)

Similarly, imaginary parts from first term: \( 300\sin\theta + 468\cos\theta \)
Imaginary parts from second term: \( -24\sin\theta + 36\cos\theta \)
Total imaginary part: \( (300 - 24)\sin\theta + (468 + 36)\cos\theta \)
Which simplifies to: \( 276\sin\theta + 504\cos\theta \)

So, the entire expression has a real part \( 324\cos\theta - 432\sin\theta \) and an imaginary part \( 276\sin\theta + 504\cos\theta \). But since we are asked for the largest possible real part, we can ignore the imaginary part for now.

So, our goal is to maximize \( 324\cos\theta - 432\sin\theta \) with respect to \( \theta \).

Hmm, I remember that expressions of the form \( A\cos\theta + B\sin\theta \) can be rewritten as \( R\cos(\theta + \phi) \) or \( R\sin(\theta + \phi) \), where \( R = \sqrt{A^2 + B^2} \). That might help in finding the maximum value. Since the maximum of \( \cos \) or \( \sin \) is 1, the maximum value of the expression would be \( R \).

Wait, but in our case, the expression is \( 324\cos\theta - 432\sin\theta \), which is \( A\cos\theta + B\sin\theta \), where \( A = 324 \) and \( B = -432 \).

So, let me compute \( R = \sqrt{A^2 + B^2} \).

Calculating \( A^2 = 324^2 \). Let me compute that:

324 * 324: Well, 300^2 = 90,000, and 24^2 = 576. Then, cross term is 2*300*24 = 14,400.

So, 324^2 = (300 + 24)^2 = 90,000 + 14,400 + 576 = 104,976.

Similarly, B^2 = (-432)^2 = 432^2. Let's compute that:

432 is 400 + 32. So, (400 + 32)^2 = 400^2 + 2*400*32 + 32^2 = 160,000 + 25,600 + 1,024 = 186,624.

So, R = sqrt(104,976 + 186,624) = sqrt(291,600).

What's sqrt(291,600)? Let me see:

I know that 540^2 = 291,60
