Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the number of triples of nonnegative integers (a, b, c) that satisfy two conditions: a + b + c = 300 and a²b + a²c + b²a + b²c + c²a + c²b = 6,000,000.

Hmm, let me start by understanding what the problem is asking. I need to find all possible triples of nonnegative integers a, b, c where their sum is 300, and another expression involving their squares and products equals 6,000,000. 

So, the first condition is straightforward: a + b + c = 300. That means each of a, b, c can range from 0 up to 300, but their sum has to be exactly 300. The second condition is more complex: the sum of a²b + a²c + b²a + b²c + c²a + c²b equals 6,000,000.

I think I should try to simplify the second expression. Let me look at it again: a²b + a²c + b²a + b²c + c²a + c²b. I notice that each term is of the form a²b, which can be factored as a²(b + c). Similarly, the other terms can be grouped as well.

Let me group the terms:

a²b + a²c = a²(b + c)
b²a + b²c = b²(a + c)
c²a + c²b = c²(a + b)

So the entire expression becomes:

a²(b + c) + b²(a + c) + c²(a + b) = 6,000,000.

Wait, but from the first equation, a + b + c = 300, so I can express (b + c) as (300 - a), (a + c) as (300 - b), and (a + b) as (300 - c).

So substituting that into the expression, we get:

a²(300 - a) + b²(300 - b) + c²(300 - c) = 6,000,000.

That might be a more manageable form. Let me write that down:

300a² - a³ + 300b² - b³ + 300c² - c³ = 6,000,000.

Hmm, this seems complicated, but maybe I can factor it differently. Let me factor out 300:

300(a² + b² + c²) - (a³ + b³ + c³) = 6,000,000.

I can divide both sides by 300 to simplify:

a² + b² + c² - (a³ + b³ + c³)/300 = 20,000.

Wait, that might not be the most helpful way. Alternatively, perhaps I should consider symmetric expressions or look for symmetry in the variables.

Alternatively, maybe I can think about the expression a²(b + c) + b²(a + c) + c²(a + b) in terms of symmetric sums.

Wait, another idea: Let me factor the expression. Maybe I can write it as ab(a + b) + bc(b + c) + ca(c + a). Hmm, that's another way to look at it. So:

ab(a + b) + bc(b + c) + ca(c + a) = 6,000,000.

But since a + b + c = 300, then a + b = 300 - c, and similarly for the others. So substituting that in, we have:

ab(300 - c) + bc(300 - a) + ca(300 - b) = 6,000,000.

Expanding each term:

300ab - abc + 300bc - abc + 300ca - abc = 6,000,000.

Combine like terms:

300(ab + bc + ca) - 3abc = 6,000,000.

So that's:

300(ab + bc + ca) - 3abc = 6,000,000.

Divide both sides by 3 to simplify:

100(ab + bc + ca) - abc = 2,000,000.

Hmm, this looks a bit better. So now, the equation is:

100(ab + bc + ca) - abc = 2,000,000.

Let me rearrange it:

abc - 100(ab + bc + ca) = -2,000,000.

Or,

abc - 100(ab + bc + ca) = -2,000,000.

Hmm, this is a symmetric equation in a, b, c. Maybe I can factor or find a substitution.

I know that in symmetric equations, sometimes substituting x = a, y = b, z = c, but perhaps considering another approach.

Wait, another thought: Let me factor the left side. Maybe factor out ab, bc, ca terms.

Alternatively, let me consider that the equation could be written as:

abc - 100ab - 100bc - 100ca = -2,000,000.

Hmm, perhaps we can factor this as (a - 100)(b - 100)(c - 100). Let me check.

Let me expand (a - 100)(b - 100)(c - 100):

= abc - 100ab - 100ac + 10000a - 100bc + 10000b + 10000c - 1,000,000.

Wait, that doesn't match. Let me compute it step by step.

First, multiply two factors:

(a - 100)(b - 100) = ab - 100a - 100b + 10,000.

Now multiply by (c - 100):

(ab - 100a - 100b + 10,000)(c - 100)

= ab*c - ab*100 - 100a*c + 100a*100 - 100b*c + 100b*100 + 10,000*c - 10,000*100.

Simplify each term:

= abc - 100ab - 100ac + 10,000a - 100bc + 10,000b + 10,000c - 1,000,000.

So the expansion is:

abc - 100ab - 100ac - 100bc + 10,000a + 10,000b + 10,000c - 1,000,000.

Compare this to our equation:

abc - 100ab - 100bc - 100ca = -2,000,000.

So, if I subtract 10,000(a + b + c) from both sides of the expanded (a - 100)(b - 100)(c - 100), I get:

(a - 100)(b - 100)(c - 100) = abc - 100ab - 100ac - 100bc + 10,000(a + b + c) - 1,000,000.

But our equation is:

abc - 100ab - 100ac - 100bc = -2,000,000.

So, let's set these equal:

(a - 100)(b - 100)(c - 100) = (abc - 100ab - 100ac - 100bc) + 10,000(a + b + c) - 1,000,000.

But from our equation, abc - 100ab - 100ac - 100bc = -2,000,000.

So substituting that in:

(a - 100)(b - 100)(c - 100) = (-2,000,000) + 10,000(a + b + c) - 1,000,000.

Simplify:

= -3,000,000 + 10,000(a + b + c).

But we also know that a + b + c = 300.

So substituting that:

= -3,000,000 + 10,000 * 300

= -3,000,000 + 3,000,000

= 0.

So, (a - 100)(b - 100)(c - 100) = 0.

Wait, that's interesting
