Okay, so I have this problem about a tetrahedron ABCD. The edges are given in pairs: AB and CD are both sqrt(41), AC and BD are sqrt(80), and BC and AD are sqrt(89). Interesting, it seems like the tetrahedron has some kind of symmetry because each pair of opposite edges are equal. 

The question asks about a point I inside the tetrahedron such that the distances from I to each of the four faces are equal. That point is called the incenter, I think, like the 3D version of the inradius in a triangle. So, I need to find the distance from this incenter to each face, and express it in the form m sqrt(n)/p, then find m + n + p.

First, I remember that for a tetrahedron, the inradius can be found using the formula:

r = 3V / S

where V is the volume of the tetrahedron and S is the total surface area. Wait, is that right? Let me think. In a triangle, the inradius is A/s, where A is the area and s is the semi-perimeter. For a tetrahedron, it's similar but involves the volume and the total area of the faces. So yes, I think V is the volume, and S is the sum of the areas of the four faces.

So, I'll need to compute the volume V of the tetrahedron and the total surface area S.

But before that, I need to figure out the areas of each triangular face. Each face is a triangle, right? Since all the edge lengths are given, I can compute the area of each face using Heron's formula.

Wait, but let me confirm the edges. AB = CD = sqrt(41), AC = BD = sqrt(80), BC = AD = sqrt(89). So, each pair of opposite edges are equal. Hmm, that makes me think the tetrahedron might be isohedral or something, but I'm not sure. Maybe it's a kind of "equifacial" tetrahedron where all faces are congruent, but in this case, since each pair of opposite edges are equal, but the faces adjacent to them might not be congruent.

Wait, actually, let's list the edges:

AB = sqrt(41)
AC = sqrt(80)
AD = sqrt(89)
BC = sqrt(89)
BD = sqrt(80)
CD = sqrt(41)

So, each face has three edges. Let's look at face ABC: edges AB, AC, BC, which are sqrt(41), sqrt(80), sqrt(89). Similarly, face ABD: edges AB, AD, BD, which are sqrt(41), sqrt(89), sqrt(80). So, actually, all the faces are triangles with sides sqrt(41), sqrt(80), sqrt(89). So, all four faces are congruent triangles. That makes things easier because each face has the same area.

So, if all four faces are congruent, then computing the area of one face and multiplying by four will give the total surface area S.

So, first step: compute the area of
