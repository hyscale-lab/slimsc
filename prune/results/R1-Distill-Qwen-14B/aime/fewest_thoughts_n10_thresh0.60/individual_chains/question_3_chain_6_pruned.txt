Okay, so I have this probability problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again.

Jen enters a lottery by picking 4 distinct numbers from S = {1,2,3,...,9,10}. 4 numbers are randomly chosen from S. She wins a prize if at least two of her numbers are among the randomly chosen numbers, and she wins the grand prize if all four of her numbers are chosen. The probability of her winning the grand prize given that she won a prize is m/n, where m and n are coprime positive integers. I need to find m + n.

Hmm, so this is a conditional probability problem. The probability of the grand prize given that she won a prize. So, in probability terms, that's P(grand prize | won prize). I remember that conditional probability is defined as P(A|B) = P(A ∩ B) / P(B). But in this case, if she wins the grand prize, she definitely has won a prize. So, P(grand prize ∩ won prize) is just P(grand prize). Therefore, P(grand prize | won prize) = P(grand prize) / P(won prize).

So, I need to compute P(grand prize) and P(won prize), then divide them. Let's break it down.

First, let's understand the setup. Jen picks 4 numbers from 10. Then, 4 numbers are randomly selected from the same 10. The total number of possible combinations for the lottery is C(10,4), which is the number of ways to choose 4 numbers out of 10. Let me compute that: 10! / (4!6!) = 210. So, there are 210 possible lottery draws.

Now, let's compute P(grand prize). This is the probability that all four of Jen's numbers are chosen. How many ways can this happen? Well, there's only one specific set of 4 numbers that Jen has. So, the number of favorable outcomes is 1. Hence, P(grand prize) = 1 / 210.

Next, I need to compute P(won prize). Winning a prize means that at least two of her numbers are among the four chosen. So, this includes two scenarios: exactly two numbers match, exactly three numbers match, or exactly four numbers match. So, it's the sum of probabilities of these three cases.

Alternatively, it's easier to compute the probability of the complementary event (i.e., not winning a prize) and subtract it from 1. Not winning a prize means that fewer than two numbers match, i.e., zero or one number matches.

So, P(won prize) = 1 - P(zero matches) - P(one match).

Let me compute P(zero matches) and P(one match).

First, P(zero matches): None of Jen's numbers are chosen. So, all four numbers are selected from the remaining 6 numbers (since 10 - 4 = 6). How many ways is that? It's C(6,4) = 15. So, the number of ways is 15, and the total possible is 210. So, P(zero matches) = 15 / 210 = 1 / 14.

Wait, wait, let me double-check that. 10 - 4 = 6, so C(6,4) is 15. Yeah, that's correct.

Next, P(one match): Exactly one of Jen's numbers is chosen, and the other three are from the remaining 6. So, the
