Okay, so I have this problem about a hyperbola and a rhombus. Let me try to unpack it step by step. The hyperbola is given by the equation x²/20 - y²/24 = 1. So, it's a standard hyperbola centered at the origin, opening left and right because the positive term is with x².

Now, the problem mentions four points A, B, C, D on this hyperbola forming a rhombus ABCD. The diagonals of the rhombus intersect at the origin. So, the center of the rhombus is at the origin, which is also the center of the hyperbola.

In a rhombus, the diagonals bisect each other at right angles, right? Wait, no, they bisect each other but not necessarily at right angles unless it's a square. But in a rhombus, the diagonals are not equal but they do bisect the angles. Hmm, but in any case, since the diagonals intersect at the origin, each vertex of the rhombus is symmetric with respect to the origin.

So, if point A is (x, y), then the opposite point C would be (-x, -y), because the diagonals bisect each other. Similarly, points B and D would be such that they are also symmetric about the origin. So, if B is (p, q), then D is (-p, -q).

Wait, but in a rhombus, all sides are equal. So, the distance between A and B should be equal to the distance between B and C, and so on. Alternatively, since it's a rhombus, the vectors AB, BC, CD, DA should all have the same magnitude.

But maybe a better approach is to consider the properties of the rhombus in terms of coordinates. Since the diagonals intersect at the origin, the diagonals are AC and BD. The diagonals of a rhombus are perpendicular bisectors of each other. So, the diagonals AC and BD are perpendicular.

Given that, let's denote the coordinates of the four points as follows: A = (x, y), C = (-x, -y), B = (p, q), D = (-p, -q). So, the diagonals AC and BD are the lines connecting A to C and B to D, respectively.

Since AC and BD are perpendicular, the product of their slopes should be -1. Let me compute the slopes. The
