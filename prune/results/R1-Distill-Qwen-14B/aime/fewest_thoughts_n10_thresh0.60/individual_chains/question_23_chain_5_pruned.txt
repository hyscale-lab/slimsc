Okay, so I have this problem here about a hyperbola and a rhombus. Let me break it down and think through it step by step.

First, the hyperbola is given by the equation x²/20 - y²/24 = 1. I know that hyperbolas have two branches, and this one opens left and right because the positive term is with x². The standard form is x²/a² - y²/b² = 1, so here a² is 20 and b² is 24. That means a is sqrt(20), which is 2*sqrt(5), and b is sqrt(24), which simplifies to 2*sqrt(6).

The problem mentions points A, B, C, D on this hyperbola forming a rhombus ABCD. A rhombus has all sides equal, and its diagonals bisect each other at right angles, but wait, no, actually, in a rhombus, the diagonals bisect each other and the angles, but they aren't necessarily perpendicular unless it's a square. Wait, no, in a rhombus, the diagonals are not necessarily perpendicular unless it's a square, but actually, wait, no, in a rhombus, the diagonals are perpendicular. Yeah, I think that's right. So, in a rhombus, the diagonals are perpendicular bisectors of each other.

The diagonals intersect at the origin, so the origin is the midpoint of both diagonals. That means if points A and C are two opposite vertices, then their midpoint is the origin. Similarly for points B and D.

So, since ABCD is a rhombus with diagonals intersecting at the origin, points A and C are reflections over the origin, as are B and D.

Now, let's denote the coordinates of the points. Let's say point A is (x, y). Then, since the midpoint of AC is the origin, point C must be (-x, -y). Similarly, if point B is (u, v), then point D is (-u, -v).

Now, since all four points lie on the hyperbola, their coordinates must satisfy the equation x²/20 - y²/24 = 1. So for point A: x²/20 - y²/24 = 1, and similarly for point B: u²/20 - v²/24 = 1.

Now, the rhombus is defined by these four points. Since it's a rhombus, all sides are equal in length, and the sides are vectors. So, the vectors AB, BC, CD, DA should all have the same magnitude.

But maybe it's easier to work with the properties of the diagonals. In a rhombus, the diagonals are perpendicular and bisect each other. So, the diagonals AC and BD are perpendicular. So, the vectors AC and BD must be perpendicular.

Wait, the vectors AC and BD: AC is from A to C, which is (-x - x, -y - y) = (-2x, -2y). But actually, the diagonal AC is the vector from A to C, which would be (-x - x, -y - y) = (-2x, -2y). Similarly, BD is from B to D, which is (-u - u, -v - v) = (-2u, -2v). Wait, actually, that's the vector for BD, but the diagonals are AC and BD, so vectors AC and BD must be perpendicular.

So, the dot product of vectors AC and BD should be zero. So:

AC • BD = 0
(-2x)(-2u) + (-2y)(-2v) = 0
4xu + 4yv = 0
Simplify: xu + yv = 0.

So that's one condition.

Another thing about a rhombus is that the diagonals bisect each other, which they do at the origin, as given.

Now, the problem is to find the greatest real number that is less than BD² for all such rhombi. So, we need to find the infimum (greatest lower bound) of BD², because the problem is asking for the greatest number that is less than BD² for all possible rhombi. So, in other words, find the minimum possible value of BD², because then that would be the lower bound, and the greatest number less than BD² for all rhombi would be that minimum.

Wait, no, the problem says "the greatest real number that is less than BD² for all such rhombi." So, it's like finding the infimum of BD². So, the smallest possible BD² would be the infimum, and any number less than that would not be a lower bound for all. So, the greatest number less than BD² for all rhombi would be the infimum if BD² can get arbitrarily close to it from above.

Wait, perhaps it's better to find the minimum possible value of BD
