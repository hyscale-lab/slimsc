Okay, so I have this problem here: I need to find the largest possible real part of the expression (75 + 117i)z + (96 + 144i)/z, where z is a complex number with |z| = 4. Hmm, that seems a bit involved, but let me try to break it down step by step.

First, I know that since z is a complex number with magnitude 4, I can represent it in the form z = 4e^{iθ}, where θ is the argument of z. Alternatively, I can write it as z = 4(cosθ + i sinθ). Maybe using exponential form will be easier when dealing with multiplication and division, but I'm not sure yet. Let's see.

So the expression is (75 + 117i)z + (96 + 144i)/z. Let me denote A = 75 + 117i and B = 96 + 144i for simplicity. So the expression becomes Az + B/z.

Since |z| = 4, then 1/z is the conjugate of z divided by |z|². Because for any complex number z, 1/z = \overline{z}/|z|². So since |z| is 4, |z|² is 16. So 1/z = \overline{z}/16.

Wait, that's useful. So substituting back, the expression becomes Az + B*(\overline{z}/16). So that's Az + (B/16)\overline{z}.

Hmm, maybe I can express this in terms of z and its conjugate. Alternatively, since z = 4e^{iθ}, then \overline{z} = 4e^{-iθ}.

So substituting z and \overline{z} into the expression:

Az + (B/16)\overline{z} = A * 4e^{iθ} + (B/16) * 4e^{-iθ}.

Simplify that: 4A e^{iθ} + (B/4) e^{-iθ}.

So that gives me 4A e^{iθ} + (B/4) e^{-iθ}.

Now, the real part of this expression is Re[4A e^{iθ} + (B/4) e^{-iθ}]. Since the real part is linear, this is equal to Re[4A e^{iθ}] + Re[(B/4) e^{-iθ}].

Let me compute each term separately.

First term: Re[4A e^{iθ}]. Let's write A as 75 + 117i. So 4A is 4*(75 + 117i) = 300 + 468i.

So 4A e^{iθ} = (300 + 468i)(cosθ + i sinθ). Let's multiply this out:

= 300 cosθ + 300i sinθ + 468i cosθ + 468i^2 sinθ.

Since i^2 = -1, that becomes:

= 300 cosθ + 300i sinθ + 468i cosθ - 468 sinθ.

Combine real and imaginary parts:

Real part: 300 cosθ - 468 sinθ.

Imaginary part: (300 sinθ + 468 cosθ) i.

So Re[4A e^{iθ}] = 300 cosθ - 468 sinθ.

Similarly, the second term is Re[(B/4) e^{-iθ}].

Let me compute B/4 first. B is 96 + 144i, so B/4 is 24 + 36i.

So (B/4) e^{-iθ} = (24 + 36i)(cos(-θ) + i sin(-θ)) = (24 + 36i)(cosθ - i sinθ).

Multiplying this out:

= 24 cosθ - 24i sinθ + 36i cosθ - 36i^2 sinθ.

Again, i^2 = -1, so:

= 24 cosθ - 24i sinθ + 36i cosθ + 36 sinθ.

Combine real and imaginary parts:

Real part: 24 cosθ + 36 sinθ.

Imaginary part: (-24 sinθ + 36 cosθ) i.

So Re[(B/4) e^{-iθ}] = 24 cosθ + 36 sinθ.

Therefore, the total real part of the entire expression is:

[300 cosθ - 468 sinθ] + [24 cosθ + 36 sinθ] = (300 + 24) cosθ + (-468 + 36) sinθ.

Simplify that:

324 cosθ - 432 sinθ.

So the real part is 324 cosθ - 432 sinθ. We need to find the maximum value of this expression as θ varies.

Hmm, that seems manageable. So we have an expression of the form C cosθ + D sinθ, which can be rewritten as R cos(θ + φ), where R is the amplitude and φ is the phase shift. The maximum value of such an expression is R.

So let's compute R. For an expression a cosθ + b sinθ, R = sqrt(a² + b²). So in this case, a is 324 and b is -432.

So R = sqrt(324² + (-432)²). Let me compute that.

First, compute 324²:

324 * 324: Let's compute 300² = 90,000, 24² = 576, and cross term 2*300*24 = 14,400.

So (300 +24)^2 = 90,000 + 14,400 + 576 = 104,976.

Similarly, 432²: Let's compute 400² = 160,000, 32²=1,024, and cross term 2*400*32=25,600.

So (400 +32)^2 = 160,000 + 25,600 + 1,024 = 186,624.

But since b is -432, its square is same as 432², so 186,624.

So R = sqrt(104,976 + 186,624) = sqrt(291,600).

What is sqrt(291,600)? Hmm, 540² is 291,600 because 500²=250,000, 40²=1,600, and cross term 2*500*40=40,000. So (500+40)^2=250,000+40,000+1,600=291,600. So R=540.

Therefore, the maximum value of the real part is 540.

Wait, is that correct? Let me double-check.

Wait, the expression is 324 cosθ - 432 sinθ. So a = 324, b = -432.

So R = sqrt(a² + b²) = sqrt(324² + 432²). So yes, 324 squared is 104,976, 432 squared is 186,624. Adding them gives 291,600. Square root is 540. So yes, the maximum real part is 540.

But wait, hold on. Because when you write a cosθ + b sinθ as R cos(θ - φ), the maximum value is indeed R, but I just want to make sure that this is correct.

Alternatively, another approach is to consider the expression 324 cosθ - 432 sinθ as a dot product of vectors (324, -432) and (cosθ, sinθ). The maximum value of the dot product is the magnitude of the vector (324, -432), which is sqrt(324² + 432²) = 540, which occurs when θ is aligned with the vector (324, -432). So that makes sense.

Therefore, the maximum real part is 540.

Wait, but let me just think again. The original expression was (75 + 117i)z + (96 + 144i)/z, with |z| =4. I converted z to 4e^{iθ}, which is correct. Then 1/z is (1/4)e^{-iθ}, which is correct because |z|=4.

So then I expressed the whole thing in terms of θ, expanded, and took the real parts. That led me to 324 cosθ - 432 sinθ, which is correct. Then finding the maximum of that expression as 540.

Therefore, the largest possible real part is 540.

Wait, but 540 seems a bit large, but given the coefficients, maybe it's correct. Let me check my calculations.

Compute 324²: 324*324. Let me compute 300*300 =90,000; 300*24=7,200; 24*300=7,200; 24*24=576.

Wait, no, that's not the right way. Wait, 324 is 300 +24, so (300 +24)^2 = 300² + 2*300*24 +24² = 90,000 + 14,400 + 576 = 104,976. Correct.

432 is 400 +32, so (400 +32)^2 = 400² + 2*400*32 +32² = 160,000 + 25,600 + 1,024 = 186,624. Correct.

So adding 104,976 + 186,624: 104,976 + 186,624. Let's compute:

104,976 + 186,624: 100,000 + 180,000 = 280,000. Then 4,976 + 6,624 = 11,600. So total is 291,600. sqrt(291,600) is indeed 540 because 540*540=291,600.

So yes, that's correct.

Alternatively, maybe there's a smarter way to see this without going through all the trigonometric steps.

Wait, perhaps using complex numbers in terms of vectors.

Let me think: Let me denote f(z) = (75 + 117i)z + (96 + 144i)/z, with |z|=4.

We can write f(z) = A z + B / z, where A = 75 + 117i and B = 96 + 144i.

We know that |z|=4, so 1/z = \overline{z}/16.

Therefore, f(z) = A z + (B \overline{z}) /16.

Hmm, so f(z) = A z + (B /16) \overline{z}.

Expressed in terms of z and its conjugate. Let me write z = x + iy, but maybe that's messy. Alternatively, let me use z = 4 e^{iθ}, so \overline{z} =4 e^{-iθ}.

So, substituting:

f(z) = A *4 e^{iθ} + (B /16)*4 e^{-iθ} = 4A e^{iθ} + (B /4) e^{-iθ}.

Which is what I did earlier.

So the real part is Re[4A e^{iθ}] + Re[(B/4) e^{-iθ}].

Which gives 324 cosθ -432 sinθ.

So the maximum is 540, as before.

Alternatively, perhaps I can think of f(z) as a sum of two complex numbers: 4A e^{iθ} and (B/4) e^{-iθ}.

The real part is the sum of their real parts.

But maybe another approach is to represent the entire expression as a single complex function and find its real part, then maximize it.

Alternatively, since we're looking for the real part, maybe we can write f(z) as a sum of two vectors in the complex plane and find the maximum projection on the real axis.

Wait, maybe let me consider f(z) = 4A e^{iθ} + (B/4) e^{-iθ}.

Let me denote these two terms as vectors:

Term1: 4A e^{iθ} = 4*(75 + 117i) * e^{iθ} = (300 + 468i) e^{iθ}.

Term2: (B/4) e^{-iθ} = (24 + 36i) e^{-iθ}.

So each term is a vector rotating in the complex plane as θ changes.

The real part of f(z) is the sum of the real parts of Term1 and Term2.

So, to find the maximum of Re(f(z)), which is Re(Term1) + Re(Term2).

Alternatively, perhaps we can think of this as the real part of the sum, which is the sum of the real parts. So it's still the same as before.

Wait, another thought: perhaps express f(z) as a function and then find its real part.

Alternatively, perhaps use calculus to maximize the real part expression as a function of θ.

We have Re(f(z)) = 324 cosθ -432 sinθ.

We can write this as R cos(θ + φ), where R is sqrt(324² + 432²) = 540, as before. So the maximum value is 540.

Alternatively, to use calculus, take derivative with respect to θ, set to zero.

Let me try that.

Let me denote f(θ) = 324 cosθ -432 sinθ.

df/dθ = -324 sinθ -432 cosθ.

Set df/dθ = 0:

-324 sinθ -432 cosθ = 0.

=> 324 sinθ + 432 cosθ = 0.

Divide both sides by 108: 3 sinθ + 4 cosθ = 0.

So 3 sinθ = -4 cosθ.

So tanθ = -4/3.

Therefore, θ = arctan(-4/3). But since tanθ is periodic every π, so the solutions are θ = arctan(-4/3) + kπ.

But since we are dealing with real part as a function of θ, which is periodic, we can just consider θ in [0, 2π).

Let me compute the value of θ where tanθ = -4/3.

So, tanθ = -4/3. Let's consider θ in which quadrants? The tangent is negative, so θ is in second or fourth quadrants.

But since sine and cosine relate to the real part, perhaps the maximum occurs at a particular θ.

Wait, perhaps we can compute sinθ and cosθ at this angle.

Let me denote sinθ = -4/5 and cosθ = 3/5 if θ is in the fourth quadrant, or sinθ = 4/5 and cosθ = -3/5 if θ is in the second quadrant. Wait, wait: let's see.

If tanθ = -4/3, then in the fourth quadrant, cosθ is positive and sinθ is negative.

So, in that case, sinθ = -4/5, cosθ = 3/5.

In the second quadrant, cosθ is negative, sinθ is positive. So sinθ = 4/5, cosθ = -3/5.

So let's compute f(θ) at both these points.

First, case 1: cosθ = 3/5, sinθ = -4/5.

f(θ) = 324*(3/5) -432*(-4/5) = (972/5) + (1728/5) = (972 + 1728)/5 = 2700 /5 = 540.

Case 2: cosθ = -3/5, sinθ=4/5.

f(θ) =324*(-3/5) -432*(4/5) = (-972/5) - (1728/5) = (-972 -1728)/5 = (-2700)/5 = -540.

So the maximum is 540, the minimum is -540.

Therefore, the maximum real part is 540.

So that's consistent with what I found earlier.

Wait a second, but I just want to make sure that when I took the derivative, I correctly set it to zero. The derivative was -324 sinθ -432 cosθ = 0, which gives 324 sinθ + 432 cosθ = 0. So yes, tanθ = -432/324 = -4/3.

So that's correct.

Alternatively, perhaps another approach is to write the expression as a single cosine function with phase shift.

So, as I did before, f(θ) = 324 cosθ -432 sinθ = R cos(θ + φ), where R is sqrt(324² + 432²) = 540, and tanφ = 432/324 = 4/3.

So, φ = arctan(4/3). Therefore, f(θ) = 540 cos(θ + φ).

The maximum value of cosine is 1, so maximum f(θ) is 540.

That's another way of seeing it.

So, all methods point towards the maximum real part being 540.

Wait, but just to make sure I didn't make any mistake in the initial expansion.

Let me recompute the real parts.

First term: Re[4A e^{iθ}].

A =75 +117i, so 4A = 300 +468i.

Multiplying by e^{iθ}: (300 +468i)(cosθ +i sinθ).

Real part: 300 cosθ -468 sinθ.

Second term: Re[(B/4) e^{-iθ}].

B =96 +144i, so B/4 =24 +36i.

Multiply by e^{-iθ}: (24 +36i)(cosθ -i sinθ).

Real part:24 cosθ +36 sinθ.

So total Real part: 300 cosθ -468 sinθ +24 cosθ +36 sinθ = (300 +24) cosθ + (-468 +36) sinθ = 324 cosθ -432 sinθ.

Yes, that's correct.

So, all steps are correct. Therefore, the maximum real part is 540.


The problem requires finding the largest possible real part of the expression \[(75 + 117i)z + \frac{96 + 144i}{z}\], where \(z\) is a complex number with \(|z| = 4\).

1. **Express \(z\) in polar form**:  
   Since \(|z| = 4\), let \(z = 4e^{i\theta}\), where \(\theta\) is the argument of \(z\).

2. **Rewrite the expression**:  
   The expression becomes:
   \[
   (75 + 117i) \cdot 4e^{i\theta} + \frac{96 + 144i}{4e^{i\theta}}
   \]
   Simplify using \(1/z = \overline{z}/|z|^2 = \overline{z}/16\):
   \[
   4(75 + 117i)e^{i\theta} + \frac{96 + 144i}{4}e^{-i\theta}
   \]
   \[
   = (300 + 468i)e^{i\theta} + (24 + 36i)e^{-i\theta}
   \]

3. **Compute the real part**:  
   Expand each term:
   - \( (300 + 468i)(\cos\theta + i\sin\theta) \) has real part \(300\cos\theta - 468\sin\theta\).
   - \( (24 + 36i)(\cos\theta - i\sin\theta) \) has real part \(24\cos\theta + 36\sin\theta\).

   Summing the real parts:
   \[
   300\cos\theta - 468\sin\theta + 24\cos\theta + 36\sin\theta = 324\cos\theta - 432\sin\theta
   \]

4. **Maximize the expression**:  
   The expression \(324\cos\theta - 432\sin\theta\) can be rewritten as \(R\cos(\theta + \phi)\), where \(R = \sqrt{324^2 + (-432)^2} = 540\). The maximum value of this expression is \(R = 540\).

**Answer**: \(\boxed{540}\)
