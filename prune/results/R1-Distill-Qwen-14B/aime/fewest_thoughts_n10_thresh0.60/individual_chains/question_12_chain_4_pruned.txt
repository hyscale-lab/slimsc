Okay, so I have this problem where I need to fill a 2x3 grid with digits. Each cell gets a single digit, and there are some conditions based on the sums of numbers formed by reading the grid in specific ways.

First, I'll try to visualize the grid. It's a 2x3 grid, so there are two rows and three columns. Let me label the cells like this:

```
a b c
d e f
```

So, when we read left to right, the top row forms a two-digit number? Wait, no, wait. Wait, the top row has three cells, so reading left to right would form a three-digit number, right? Because 2x3 grid, each row is three cells. Similarly, each column has two cells, so reading top to bottom would form a two-digit number.

Wait, the example given is:

0 0 8
9 9 1

So, the top row is 008, which is 8, and the bottom row is 991. So, 8 + 991 = 999, which checks out.

Then, reading top to bottom, each column forms a number. So column 1 is 0 and 9, which is 09 or just 9, column 2 is 0 and 9, which is 9, column 3 is 8 and 1, which is 81. Then, 9 + 9 + 81 = 99, which is correct.

So, the problem is to find the number of such grids where:

1. The sum of the two three-digit numbers (top and bottom rows) is 999.
2. The sum of the three two-digit numbers (each column read top to bottom) is 99.

So, each cell can contain digits from 0 to 9. But, for the first row, since it's a three-digit number, the first digit (a) can be 0, which is fine because numbers like 008 are considered as 8, but I think in terms of digit placement, each position is just a digit regardless of leading zeros. So, for the grid, each cell is a digit, and the grid's rows and columns form numbers as specified.

So, now, let's model the problem.

First, the top row forms a number ABC, which is 100*A + 10*B + C.

The bottom row forms DEF, which is 100*D + 10*E + F.

We are told that ABC + DEF = 999.

Similarly, each column forms a two-digit number:

- First column: A followed by D, which is 10*A + D.
- Second column: B followed by E, which is 10*B + E.
- Third column: C followed by F, which is 10*C + F.

And the sum of these three two-digit numbers is 99.

So, the problem reduces to solving the equations:

1. (100A + 10B + C) + (100D + 10E + F) = 999
2. (10A + D) + (10B + E) + (10C + F) = 99

We need to find the number of possible (A,B,C,D,E,F) tuples that satisfy these two equations, where each of A,B,C,D,E,F is a digit (0-9).

Let me write these equations more clearly.

Equation 1:
100A + 10B + C + 100D + 10E + F = 999

Equation 2:
10A + D + 10B + E + 10C + F = 99

Hmm, perhaps we can subtract equation 2 from equation 1 to find a relationship between them. Let me compute equation 1 minus equation 2.

Equation 1 - Equation 2:

(100A + 10B + C + 100D + 10E + F) - (10A + D + 10B + E + 10C + F) = 999 - 99

Simplify the left side:

100A -10A + 10B -10B + C -10C + 100D - D + 10E - E + F - F = 900

Which simplifies to:

90A -9C + 99D +9E = 900

We can factor out 9:

9*(10A - C + 11D + E) = 900

Divide both sides by 9:

10A - C + 11D + E = 100

So, now we have:

10A - C + 11D + E = 100   --- Let's call this Equation 3.

So, Equation 3 is a result of combining Equations 1 and 2. Now, let's see if we can find another equation or perhaps express variables in terms of others.

Looking back at Equation 2:

10A + D + 10B + E + 1
