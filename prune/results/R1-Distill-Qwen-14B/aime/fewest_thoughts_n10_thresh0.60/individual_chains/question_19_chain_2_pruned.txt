Okay, so I have this geometry problem here. Let me try to understand it step by step.

We have triangle ABC with circumcenter O and incenter I. It says that IA is perpendicular to OI. The circumradius is 13, and the inradius is 6. We need to find the product AB times AC.

Hmm, okay. Let me recall some properties of circumcenters and incenters.

The circumradius R is given as 13, so the distance from the circumcenter O to each vertex is 13. The inradius r is 6, which is the radius of the incircle tangent to all three sides.

I also remember that the inradius can be expressed in terms of the area and the semiperimeter: r = A/s, where A is the area and s is the semiperimeter.

Wait, and the area can also be expressed using the circumradius: A = (a*b*c)/(4R), where a, b, c are the sides of the triangle. But I'm not sure how that connects yet.

The problem states that IA is perpendicular to OI. So, the line from the incenter I to vertex A is perpendicular to the line from the circumcenter O to I. That seems like a key condition to use here.

Maybe I can use coordinates. Let me try to assign a coordinate system. Let's place point A at (0,0), point B at (c,0), and point C somewhere in the plane. But I'm not sure if that will help directly, because I don't know the coordinates of O and I.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use vector geometry. But that might get complicated.

Wait, maybe there's a formula or theorem that relates the distance between the incenter and circumcenter. I recall that the distance OI can be expressed as sqrt(R(R - 2r)). Let me verify that formula.

Yes, Euler's formula states that OI² = R(R - 2r). So, plugging in R=13 and r=6, we have OI² = 13*(13 - 12) = 13*1 =13. So OI = sqrt(13).

But in the problem, IA is perpendicular to OI. So, the line IA is perpendicular to the segment OI. Which means that triangle OIA is a right-angled triangle at I.

So, in triangle OIA, angle at I is 90 degrees. So, by Pythagoras, OA² = OI² + IA².

Wait, OA is the circumradius, so OA=13. OI is sqrt(13), so OI²=13. IA is the length from incenter I to vertex A.

So, OA² = OI² + IA² => 13² = 13 + IA². So, 169 = 13 + IA² => IA²=156 => IA= sqrt(156)=2*sqrt(39).

Hmm, so IA is 2*sqrt(39). Interesting.

I remember that the length from the incenter to a vertex can be expressed using the formula IA = r / sin(A/2), where A is the angle at vertex A. Let me confirm this.

Yes, the formula for the distance from the incenter to vertex A is IA = r / sin(A/2). So, IA = 6 / sin(A/2) = 2*sqrt(39). Therefore, 6 / sin(A/2) = 2*sqrt(39).

So, sin(A/2) = 6/(2*sqrt(39)) = 3/sqrt(39) = sqrt(39)/13 (since 3/sqrt(39) = 3*sqrt(39)/39 = sqrt(39)/13).

So, sin(A/2) = sqrt(39)/13.

Now, from this, I can find cos(A/
