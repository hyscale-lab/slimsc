Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the number of ways to fill a 2x3 grid with digits (0-9) such that two conditions are met. The first condition is that when I read the grid left to right, the two numbers formed add up to 999. The second condition is that when I read the grid top to bottom, the three numbers formed add up to 99. 

Let me try to visualize the grid. It's a 2x3 grid, so two rows and three columns. If I label the cells as a1, a2, a3 in the first row and b1, b2, b3 in the second row, then the numbers formed left to right would be the first row as a number, say A = a1a2a3, and the second row as B = b1b2b3. So A + B should equal 999.

Similarly, reading top to bottom, each column forms a two-digit number. So the first column is a1b1, the second is a2b2, and the third is a3b3. The sum of these three two-digit numbers should be 99. So (a1b1) + (a2b2) + (a3b3) = 99.

Hmm, okay. Let me write this down more formally.

Let me denote:

A = 100*a1 + 10*a2 + a3

B = 100*b1 + 10*b2 + b3

And the sum A + B = 999.

Also, the column sums:

C1 = 10*a1 + b1

C2 = 10*a2 + b2

C3 = 10*a3 + b3

And C1 + C2 + C3 = 99.

So now I have these equations:

1. 100a1 + 10a2 + a3 + 100b1 + 10b2 + b3 = 999

2. 10a1 + b1 + 10a2 + b2 + 10a3 + b3 = 99

I need to find the number of possible 6-digit sequences (a1, a2, a3, b1, b2, b3) where each digit is between 0 and 9, satisfying these two equations.

Let me see if I can manipulate these equations to find relationships between the digits.

First, equation 1:

100a1 + 10a2 + a3 + 100b1 + 10b2 + b3 = 999

Equation 2:

(10a1 + b1) + (10a2 + b2) + (10a3 + b3) = 99

So, equation 1 can be rewritten by grouping the a's and b's:

(100a1 + 10a2 + a3) + (100b1 + 10b2 + b3) = 999

Which is A + B = 999 as before.

Equation 2 is:

10(a1 + a2 + a3) + (b1 + b2 + b3) = 99

So, from equation 2:

10*(sum of a's) + (sum of b's) = 99

Let me denote S_a = a1 + a2 + a3 and S_b = b1 + b2 + b3.

So equation 2 becomes: 10*S_a + S_b = 99.

From this, I can express S_b as: S_b = 99 - 10*S_a.

Since S_a and S_b are sums of digits, their possible ranges are:

For S_a: each a_i is 0-9, so sum S_a can be 0 to 27.

Similarly, S_b is 0 to 27.

But since S_b = 99 -10*S_a, let's see what possible S_a can be.

99 -10*S_a must be between 0 and 27.

So,

0 ≤ 99 -10*S_a ≤ 27

Let's solve for S_a:

First, lower bound:

99 -10*S_a ≥ 0 => 10*S_a ≤ 99 => S_a ≤ 9.9, but since S_a is an integer, S_a ≤9.

Upper bound:

99 -10*S_a ≤27 => 99-27 ≤10*S_a =>72 ≤10*S_a => S_a ≥7.2, so S_a ≥8.

So S_a must be an integer between 8 and 9, inclusive.

So S_a can be 8 or 9.

Case 1: S_a =8

Then S_b = 99 -10*8 = 99 -80=19

Case 2: S_a=9

Then S_b=99 -10*9=99-90=9

So we have two cases: either S_a=8 and S_b=19, or S_a=9 and S_b=9.

Now, let me consider equation 1.

Equation 1: A + B = 999.

But A is a 3-digit number (from a1a2a3) and B is another 3-digit number (from b1b2b3). Their sum is 999.

So A + B =999.

Which implies that A = 999 - B.

But since A and B are 3-digit numbers, their individual ranges are 0 to 999. But 999 is a 3-digit number. However, since A and B are formed by digits a1,a2,a3 and b1,b2,b3, each a_i and b_i can be zero, so A can be as low as 0 (if all a_i are 0) and up to 999. Same for B.

Wait, but if A is a 3-digit number with digits a1,a2,a3, then A can be from 0 to 999, but leading zeros are allowed. Similarly for B.

But wait, when you add two 3-digit numbers, such as A and B, the maximum sum is 999 + 999 =1998, but here the sum is exactly 999, which is less than 1000. Hmm, but 999 is a 3-digit number.

So, when adding A and B, the sum is 999, which is a 3-digit number. So, A and B are such that their sum is 999. That implies that A = 999 - B.

But A is formed by a1,a2,a3, and B by b1,b2,b3. So perhaps I can find a relationship between the digits of A and B.

But wait, maybe it's easier to think about A + B = 999 in terms of digit-wise addition, considering the carry-over.

Let me write A and B as follows:

A = 100a1 + 10a2 + a3

B = 100b1 + 10b2 + b3

So, A + B = 100(a1 + b1) + 10(a2 + b2) + (a3 + b3) = 999.

Which is:

100(a1 + b1) + 10(a2 + b2) + (a3 + b3) = 999.

But 999 is 100*9 + 10*9 +9.

So, this equation can be broken down digit-wise, considering possible carry-over from the lower digits.

Let me denote:

Let me think about the units place: a3 + b3 must equal 9, or 19 if there's a carry-over from the tens place. But wait, in this case, since A and B are both 3-digit numbers, each digit addition (units, tens, hundreds) can have a carry-over.

Wait, but let me think step by step:

Starting from the units digit:

a3 + b3 = 9 + 10 * c1, where c1 is the carry-over to the tens place (0 or 1).

Similarly, then the tens digit:

a2 + b2 + c1 = 9 + 10 * c2, where c2 is the carry-over to the hundreds place (0 or 1).

And the hundreds digit:

a1 + b1 + c2 = 9 + 10 * c3.

But since the total sum is 999, which is a 3-digit number, c3 must be zero because if a1 + b1 + c2 ≥10, then the sum would be 1000 or more, but it's 999. So c3 =0.

So:

a1 + b1 + c2 =9.

And a2 + b2 + c1 =9 + 10 c2.

And a3 + b3 =9 +10 c1.

But let me write these equations:

1. a3 + b3 = 9 + 10 c1   --> (Equation A)

2. a2 + b2 + c1 =9 +10 c2   --> (Equation B)

3. a1 + b1 + c2 =9        --> (Equation C)

And c1 and c2 are either 0 or 1.

So, possible cases for c1 and c2.

Let me think about possible values for c1 and c2.

Case 1: c1=0.

Then from Equation A: a3 + b3 =9.

From Equation B: a2 + b2 +0 =9 +10 c2. So a2 + b2=9 +10 c2.

But a2 and b2 are digits (0-9), so
