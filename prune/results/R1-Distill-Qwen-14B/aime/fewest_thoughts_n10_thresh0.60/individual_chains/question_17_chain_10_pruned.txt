Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we have a set of rectangular boxes, each with a surface area of 54 and a volume of 23. We need to find the radius of the smallest sphere that can contain each of these boxes. Then, express r squared as a fraction p/q, where p and q are coprime, and find p + q.

Hmm, the problem mentions rectangular boxes, so I'm assuming they're talking about rectangular prisms. Each box has length, width, and height, let's say a, b, c. The surface area of a rectangular box is given by 2(ab + bc + ac) = 54, and the volume is abc = 23.

Our goal is to find the smallest sphere that can contain any such box. The sphere's radius will depend on the size of the box, so we need to find the maximum possible distance from the center of the sphere to any corner of the box, which would be half the space diagonal of the box. The space diagonal d of a box with sides a, b, c is sqrt(a² + b² + c²). Therefore, the radius r of the sphere is half of that, so r = sqrt(a² + b² + c²)/2. So, we need to minimize r, which is equivalent to minimizing the space diagonal.

Wait, no, actually, since the sphere has to contain each box, and each box can potentially have different dimensions, we need to find the maximum possible space diagonal across all boxes in set B. Because the sphere has to contain the box regardless of its specific dimensions, as long as it satisfies the surface area and volume constraints. So, the smallest sphere that can contain all possible boxes in B would have a radius equal to the maximum space diagonal divided by 2.

So, we need to maximize the space diagonal sqrt(a² + b² + c²), given the constraints on surface area and volume. So, the problem reduces to maximizing a² + b² + c², given that 2(ab + bc + ac) = 54 and abc = 23.

Alternatively, since we're dealing with symmetric expressions, maybe we can express a² + b² + c² in terms of the surface area and volume.

I remember that (a + b + c)² = a² + b² + c² + 2(ab + bc + ac). So, a² + b² + c² = (a + b + c)^2 - 2(ab + bc + ac).

We know that 2(ab + bc + ac) = 54, so ab + bc + ac = 27. Therefore, a² + b² + c² = (a + b + c)^2 - 54.

So, if we can find a + b + c, then we can find a² + b² + c².

But how do we relate a + b + c to the given volume and surface area? Hmm.

I think maybe we can use Lagrange multipliers here because we're trying to maximize a function (a² + b² + c²) subject to constraints (surface area and volume). But since the problem is symmetric in a, b, c, perhaps the maximum occurs when two variables are equal or when all three are equal? Wait, but if all three are equal, then the box is a cube. Let me check if that's possible.

If a = b = c, then the surface area would be 6a² = 54, so a² = 9, so a = 3. Then the volume would be 27, but in our case, the volume is 23, which is less than 27. So, it's not a cube. Therefore, the maximum must occur at some unequal dimensions.

So, maybe we can assume two variables are equal. Let
