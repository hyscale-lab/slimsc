Okay, so I've got this geometry problem here. It says:

Let triangle ABC have circumcenter O and incenter I with IA perpendicular to OI, circumradius 13, and inradius 6. Find AB·AC.

Hmm. Alright, let's break this down. I need to find the product of sides AB and AC. The given information includes the circumradius, inradius, and a perpendicularity condition between IA and OI.

First, let's recall some concepts. The circumradius (R) is given as 13, and the inradius (r) is 6. The incenter (I) is the intersection of angle bisectors, and the circumcenter (O) is the intersection of perpendicular bisectors. Both are important centers in triangle geometry.

The condition IA ⊥ OI is interesting. So, the line from the incenter to vertex A is perpendicular to the line from the incenter to the circumcenter. That must give us some relationship between the sides or angles of the triangle.

I think I should draw a diagram to visualize this. Let me sketch triangle ABC, mark O as the circumcenter, I as the incenter, and draw IA and OI. Since IA is perpendicular to OI, that forms a right angle at I between IA and OI.

Wait, maybe I can use coordinate geometry here. If I place the triangle in a coordinate system, maybe with point I at the origin, that could simplify things. Let me try that.

Let's set up a coordinate system where point I is at (0, 0). Then, since IA is perpendicular to OI, and O is a point such that OI is a vector from I to O. Let me denote vector OI as (h, k). Then, since IA is perpendicular to OI, the vector IA must satisfy the dot product being zero.

Wait, IA is a vector from I to A, so if I is at (0,0), then A is at some point (x, y). Vector IA is (x, y), and vector OI is (h, k). Since IA is perpendicular to OI, their dot product must be zero: x*h + y*k = 0.

But I also know that the circumradius is 13, so the distance from O to each vertex (including A) should be 13. So, OA = 13. Since O is at (h, k), the distance from O to A is sqrt[(x - h)^2 + (y - k)^2] = 13.

Also, since I is the incenter, the distances from I to each side are equal to the inradius, which is 6. The inradius formula is r = A/s, where A is the area and s is the semiperimeter. Hmm, not sure if that's directly useful yet.

Wait, maybe using trigonometric identities would help here. I remember that in a triangle, the distance between the incenter and circumcenter is given by the formula:

OI = sqrt(R(R - 2r))

Where R is the circumradius and r is the inradius. Let me plug in the given values: R = 13, r = 6. So,

OI = sqrt(13(13 - 12)) = sqrt(13 * 1) = sqrt(13)

Wait, that's nice. So the distance between O and I is sqrt(13).

But in our coordinate system, OI is the distance from (0,0) to (h,k), which is sqrt(h^2 + k^2) = sqrt(13). So h² + k² = 13.

Also, from the perpendicularity condition, x*h + y*k = 0.

And OA = 13, so (x - h)^2 + (y - k)^2 = 13^2 = 169.

So, let's write down these equations:

1. h² + k² = 13
2. x*h
