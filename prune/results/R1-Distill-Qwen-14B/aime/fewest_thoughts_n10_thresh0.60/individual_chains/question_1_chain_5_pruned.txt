Okay, so I've got this problem here with logarithms and variables x, y, and z. Hmm, let me see. The equations are:

1. log₂(x/(y z)) = 1/2
2. log₂(y/(x z)) = 1/3
3. log₂(z/(x y)) = 1/4

And we need to find the absolute value of log₂(x⁴ y³ z²), which will be a fraction m/n, and then find m + n.

First, I remember that log₂(a/b) = log₂ a - log₂ b. So maybe I can rewrite each equation using that property.

Starting with the first equation:
log₂(x) - log₂(y) - log₂(z) = 1/2.

Similarly, the second equation:
log₂(y) - log₂(x) - log₂(z) = 1/3.

And the third equation:
log₂(z) - log₂(x) - log₂(y) = 1/4.

Hmm, interesting. So if I let a = log₂(x), b = log₂(y), and c = log₂(z), then the equations become:

1. a - b - c = 1/2
2. -a + b - c = 1/3
3. -a - b + c = 1/4

Now I have a system of three linear equations with three variables a, b, c. I can try solving this system.

Let me write them again:

1. a - b - c = 1/2
2. -a + b - c = 1/3
3. -a - b + c = 1/4

I think I'll add all three equations together to see if that helps. Adding equation 1, 2, and 3:

(a - b - c) + (-a + b - c) + (-a - b + c) = 1/2 + 1/3 + 1/4

Let me compute the left side:

a - b - c - a + b - c - a - b + c = combine like terms.

a - a - a = -a.

-b + b - b = -b.

-c - c + c = -c.

So altogether: -a - b - c = 1/2 + 1/3 + 1/4.

Wait, but on the right side, let's compute the sum:

1/2 is 6/12, 1/3 is 4/12, 1/4 is 3/12. So 6 + 4 + 3 = 13, so 13/12.

So, -a - b - c = 13/12.

But that's interesting. Now, if I can find a, b, c individually, then I can compute log₂(x⁴ y³ z²) as 4a + 3b + 2c.

Wait, let me make sure. Because x⁴ y³ z² would have exponents 4,3,2 on x,y,z, so log₂(x⁴ y³ z²) = log₂(x⁴) + log₂(y³) + log₂(z²) = 4 log₂x + 3 log₂y + 2 log₂z = 4a + 3b + 2c.

So we need to find 4a + 3b + 2c in absolute value.

But first, let's solve for a, b, c.

We have:

Equation 1: a - b - c = 1/2

Equation 2: -a + b - c = 1/3

Equation 3: -a - b + c = 1/4

And from adding all three, we have:

-a - b - c = 13/12 --> Equation 4.

So, equation 4: -a - b - c = 13/12.

Now, let's see if we can express other equations in terms of equation 4.

Looking back to equation 1: a - b - c = 1/2.

If I add equation 1 and equation 4:

(a - b - c) + (-a - b - c) = 1/2 + 13/12.

Simplify left side:

a -a cancels. Then -b - b = -2b. -c -c = -2c.

So left side: -2b -2c = (1/2 + 13/12).

Convert 1/2 to 6/12, so 6/12 +13/12=19/12.

So: -2b -2c = 19/12.

Divide both sides by -2:

b + c = -19/24.

Hmm, okay. Let me note that as equation 5: b + c = -19/24.

Similarly, let's take equation 2: -a + b - c =1/3.

Add equation 2 and equation 4:

(-a + b - c) + (-a - b - c) = 1/3 + 13/12.

Left side:

- a -a = -2a.

b - b cancels.

- c - c = -2c.

So left side: -2a -2c = sum.

Right side: 1/3 is 4/12, so 4/12 +13/12 =17/12.

So: -2a -2c =17/12.

Divide both sides by -2:

a + c = -17/24. Equation 6: a + c = -17/24.

Similarly, take equation3: -a - b + c =1/4.

Add equation3 and equation4:

(-a - b + c) + (-a - b - c) =1/4 +13/12.

Left side:

- a -a = -2a.

- b -b = -2b.

c -c cancels.

So left side: -2a -2b.

Right side: 1/4 is 3/12, so 3/12 +13/12=16/12=4/3.

So: -2a -2b =4/3.

Divide both sides by -2:

a + b= -2/3. Equation7: a + b= -2/3.

So now, from equation7: a + b = -2/3.

From equation6: a + c = -17/24.

From equation5: b + c =-19/24.

So, now we have:

Equation7: a + b = -2/3.

Equation6: a + c = -17/24.

Equation5: b + c = -19/24.

Let me try to solve for a, b, c.

Subtract equation6 from equation7: (a + b) - (a + c) = (-2/3) - (-17/24).

Simplify left side: a cancels, b - c.

Right side: -2/3 +17/24.

Convert to 24ths: -16/24 +17/24=1/24.

So equation8: b - c = 1/24.

From equation5: b + c = -19/24.

So now we have two equations:

Equation5: b + c = -19/24.

Equation8: b - c =1/24.

We can solve these two equations for b and c.

Adding equation5 and equation8:

(b + c) + (b - c) = (-19/24) + (1/24).

Left side: 2b.

Right side: (-18)/24 = -3/4.

So 2b = -3/4 → b = (-3/4)/2 = -3/8.

So, b= -3/8.

Now, plug b into equation5: (-3/8) + c = -19/24.

So, c= -19/24 +3/8.

Convert 3/8 to 9/24: -19/24 +9/24 = (-10)/24= -5/12.

So, c= -5/12.

Now, plug b into equation7: a + (-3/8) = -2/3.

So, a = -2/3 +3/8.

Convert to 24 denominator: -16/24 +9/24= (-7)/24.

So a= -7/24.

So, we have:

a= log₂x= -7/24.

b= log₂y= -3/8.

c=log₂z= -5/12.

Wait, but x, y, z are positive real numbers, so their logs can be negative, meaning x,y,z are fractions.

Okay, now we need to find log₂(x⁴ y³ z²)=4a +3b +2c.

So, let's compute that.

4a =4*(-7/24)= -28/24= -7/6.
