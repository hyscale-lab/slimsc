Okay, so I have this problem here where I need to find the number of triples of nonnegative integers (a, b, c) that satisfy two conditions: a + b + c = 300, and a^2b + a^2c + b^2a + b^2c + c^2a + c^2b = 6,000,000. Hmm, that seems a bit tricky, but let's try to break it down.

First, let me write down what's given:

1. a + b + c = 300.
2. a²b + a²c + b²a + b²c + c²a + c²b = 6,000,000.

I notice that the second equation has terms like a²b, which suggests that each term is a product of two variables where one is squared. Maybe I can factor or rearrange this expression to make it more manageable.

Let me see: the expression a²b + a²c + b²a + b²c + c²a + c²b. Hmm, I can factor it by grouping terms. Let's group terms with similar variables:

= a²b + a²c + b²a + b²c + c²a + c²b
= a²(b + c) + b²(a + c) + c²(a + b)

That's better. Now, since a + b + c = 300, I can express (b + c) as (300 - a), and similarly for the others.

So substituting, the second equation becomes:

a²(300 - a) + b²(300 - b) + c²(300 - c) = 6,000,000.

Hmm, that's interesting. Let me write that out:

300a² - a³ + 300b² - b³ + 300c² - c³ = 6,000,000.

Which simplifies to:

300(a² + b² + c²) - (a³ + b³ + c³) = 6,000,000.

Okay, so now I have:

300(a² + b² + c²) - (a³ + b³ + c³) = 6,000,000.

Hmm, I wonder if I can find a relationship between a² + b² + c² and a³ + b³ + c³ using the first equation a + b + c = 300.

I recall that there's an identity involving sums of powers. Let me think... Maybe I can use the identity for (a + b + c)^3?

Wait, (a + b + c)^3 = a³ + b³ + c³ + 3(a + b)(b + c)(c + a). Hmm, not sure if that's directly useful. Alternatively, another identity:

a³ + b³ + c³ - 3abc = (a + b + c)(a² + b² + c² - ab - bc - ac).

That might be useful because I have a + b + c = 300, and I also have a² + b² + c² in the equation.

Let me denote S = a + b + c = 300.

Let me denote Q = a² + b² + c².

And P = ab + bc + ac.

I also know that S² = a² + b² + c² + 2(ab + bc + ac) = Q + 2P. So, from that, I can express Q as Q = S² - 2P.

Since S = 300, Q = 300² - 2P = 90000 - 2P.

Now, going back to the expression involving a³ + b³ + c³.

From the identity:

a³ + b³ + c³ = 3abc + (a + b + c)(a² + b² + c² - ab - bc - ac).

Which is:

a³ +
