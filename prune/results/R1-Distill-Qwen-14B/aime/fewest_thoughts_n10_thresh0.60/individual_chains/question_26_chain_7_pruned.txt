Okay, so I have this geometry problem here. Let me read it again.

We have triangle ABC inscribed in a circle ω. The tangents to ω at B and C intersect at point D. Then, line AD intersects ω again at P. We are given AB=5, BC=9, AC=10. We need to find AP, express it as a fraction m/n where m and n are coprime, and then find m + n.

Hmm, okay. Let me visualize the problem. Triangle ABC with sides 5, 9, 10. The circle ω is the circumcircle of ABC. The tangents at B and C meet at D. Then, connecting A to D, and this line intersects the circle again at P. We need to find the length AP.

First, I should recall some properties about tangents and circles. The tangent at a point on a circle is perpendicular to the radius at that point. So, the tangent at B is perpendicular to OB, where O is the center of ω. Similarly, the tangent at C is perpendicular to OC.

Since D is the intersection of the two tangents, BD is tangent at B and CD is tangent at C, so BD is perpendicular to OB, and CD perpendicular to OC. Therefore, D lies on the external homothety axis of the circle, but maybe that's not directly helpful.

Alternatively, triangles DBC and ABC might have some relationship. Wait, D is the exsimilicenter of the circle with respect to B and C? Or is it the ex-pole? Hmm.

Wait, another thought: The point D is the exsimilicenter (external homothety center) of the circle ω with respect to points B and C. Because the tangents from D to ω are equal in length, so DB = DC. So, triangle DBC is an isosceles triangle with DB=DC.

Wait, no. Because BD and CD are both tangents from D to the circle ω. So, yes, BD = CD. So, triangle DBC is isosceles with DB = DC.

So, D lies on the perpendicular bisector of BC. Therefore, if I can find coordinates for the points, maybe I can find D.

Alternatively, since ABC has sides 5,9,10, perhaps I can compute its
