Okay, so I've got this problem about a regular octagon where each vertex is colored either red or blue independently with equal probability. I need to find the probability that there exists a rotation of the octagon such that all the blue vertices end up where there were originally red vertices. The answer should be in the form of a fraction m/n, where m and n are coprime, and then find m + n.

Hmm, let me break this down. First, a regular octagon has 8 sides, so it has 8 vertices. Each vertex can be colored red or blue, each with a 50% chance. So, the total number of possible colorings is 2^8 = 256. That will be our denominator when calculating the probability.

Now, the key part is figuring out how many of these colorings satisfy the condition: there exists a rotation such that all blue vertices end up where there were originally red vertices. Let me try to visualize this. If I have a certain coloring, I can rotate the octagon by 0°, 45°, 90°, ..., 315° (i.e., multiples of 45° up to 315°). For each rotation, I can check if the blue vertices in the new position were red in the original coloring.

Wait, more precisely, for a given coloring, I want to see if there's some rotation where every blue vertex after rotation was a red vertex before the rotation. So, for each possible rotation, I can think of it as mapping the original vertices to new positions. If all the blue vertices in the original coloring, when rotated, land on vertices that were originally red, then that rotation is valid.

But since the octagon is regular, its rotational symmetries form the group C8, the cyclic group of order 8. So, each rotation corresponds to an element of this group. Now, for a given coloring, we need to check if there's a group element (rotation) such that when we apply it, all blue vertices are mapped to red vertices in the original coloring.

Hmm, perhaps it's easier to think about the colorings in terms of their orbits. Or maybe using Burnside's lemma? Wait, Burnside's lemma is useful for counting the number of colorings invariant under group actions, but I'm not sure if it directly applies here. Let me think.

Alternatively, perhaps I can model this as a permutation. Each rotation is a permutation of the vertices. So, for a given coloring, I want that under some permutation (rotation), the image of the blue vertices (after rotation) are all red in the original coloring.

Wait, but in terms of the coloring itself, maybe the condition is that the set of blue vertices is a subset of the image of the red vertices under some rotation. Or is it the other way around? Let me clarify.

Suppose the original coloring has a set B of blue vertices and R of red vertices, with B ∪ R = all vertices, and B ∩ R = empty. Then, after some rotation σ, the image of B under σ (σ(B)) must be a subset of R. In other words, σ(B) ⊆ R.

But since R is the complement of B, σ(B) must be a subset of the original R, which is the same as σ(B) ∩ B = empty. Because R = V \ B
