Okay, so I'm trying to solve this geometry problem. Let me read it again carefully.

We have two rectangles, ABCD and EFGH. Points D, E, C, F are collinear. Also, points A, D, H, G lie on a circle. The given lengths are BC = 16, AB = 107, FG = 17, and EF = 184. We need to find the length of CE.

Hmm, let me visualize this. Two rectangles, so each has four right angles. Let me try to sketch a rough diagram mentally.

First, rectangle ABCD. Let me label the points: A, B, C, D. Since it's a rectangle, AB is one side, BC is another. So AB is 107 units, BC is 16 units. So AB is longer than BC. So ABCD is a rectangle where AB and CD are 107 units, and BC and AD are 16 units.

Now, the other rectangle is EFGH. Since it's a rectangle, EF and GH are one pair of sides, FG and EH are the other pair. Given FG is 17 and EF is 184. So EF is much longer than FG. So EFGH is a long and skinny rectangle.

The points D, E, C, F are collinear. That means they lie on the same straight line. So D is a corner of the first rectangle, E is a corner of the second rectangle, C is another corner of the first rectangle, and F is another corner of the second rectangle.

Wait, let me think about the order. Since D, E, C, F are collinear, the order along the line would be D, E, C, F or maybe another order? Let me think about the positions.

In rectangle ABCD, the points are in order A, B, C, D. So, if I imagine the rectangle, A is connected to B and D, B is connected to C, C is connected to D, and so on.

Similarly, rectangle EFGH: E is connected to F and H, F is connected to G, G is connected to H, and so on.

So, if D, E, C, F are collinear, probably the line goes through D, then E, then C, then F? Or maybe another order.

But let me think about the circle. Points A, D, H, G lie on a circle. So these four points are concyclic, meaning they lie on the same circle.

So, A is a corner of the first rectangle, D is another corner. H and G are corners of the second rectangle.

Hmm, this is a bit complicated. Maybe I can assign coordinates to these points to make it easier.

Let's place rectangle ABCD on a coordinate system. Let me assume point A is at the origin (0,0). Then, since AB is 107, point B would be at (107, 0). BC is 16, so point C is at (107,16), and point D is at (0,16).

Wait, no. Wait, in a rectangle, adjacent sides are perpendicular. So, if AB is 107 and BC is 16, then yes, if A is (0
