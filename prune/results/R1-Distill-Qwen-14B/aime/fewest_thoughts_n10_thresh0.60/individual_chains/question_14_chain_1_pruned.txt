Okay, so I've got this math problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again and try to understand what's being asked.

The problem says: Let N be the greatest four-digit positive integer with the property that whenever one of its digits is changed to 1, the resulting number is divisible by 7. Then, Q and R are the quotient and remainder when N is divided by 1000. I need to find Q + R.

Alright, so N is a four-digit number, which means it's between 1000 and 9999. And N is the greatest such number with this specific property. The property is that if you change any one of its digits to 1, the new number becomes divisible by 7. Interesting. So, for example, if N is ABCD, then changing A to 1 gives 1BCD, which is divisible by 7; changing B to 1 gives A1CD, which is also divisible by 7; and so on for C and D.

My goal is to find N, then divide it by 1000 to get Q (the quotient) and R (the remainder). Then add Q and R together.

Hmm. Let me break this down. First, I need to find N, the largest four-digit number with this property. Then, compute Q + R.

So, how do I approach finding N?

Let me think. N is a four-digit number, let's denote it as N = WXYZ, where W, X, Y, Z are its digits, with W being the thousands digit, X the hundreds, Y the tens, and Z the ones.

The condition is that if any single digit is changed to 1, the resulting number is divisible by 7.

So, for example:

- Changing W to 1: 1XYZ must be divisible by 7.
- Changing X to 1: W1YZ must be divisible by 7.
- Changing Y to 1: WX1Z must be divisible by 7.
- Changing Z to 1: WXY1 must be divisible by 7.

So, four different numbers, each formed by changing one digit to 1, each must be divisible by 7.

Since N is the greatest such four-digit number, I might want to start from 9999 and work my way down, checking each number to see if it satisfies this condition. But that's a lot of numbers—9999 possibilities. So, I need a smarter approach.

Let me think about the divisibility by 7. When you change a digit to 1, the number becomes divisible by 7. So, for each digit position, the modified number must be congruent to 0 mod 7.

Let me write the conditions mathematically.

For N = WXYZ, let's denote:

- When changing W to 1: 1000*1 + 100*X + 10*Y + Z ≡ 0 mod 7
- When changing X to 1: 1000*W + 100*1 + 10*Y + Z ≡ 0 mod 7
- When changing Y to 1: 1000*W + 100*X + 10*1 + Z ≡ 0 mod 7
- When changing Z to 1: 1000*W + 100*X + 10*Y + 1 ≡ 0 mod 7

So, these four conditions must all hold.

Let me compute each of these modulo 7.

First, note that 1000 mod 7, 100 mod 7, 10 mod 7, and 1 mod 7.

Calculating these:

- 1000 ÷ 7: 7*142 = 994, so 1000 - 994 = 6. So, 1000 ≡ 6 mod 7.
- 100 ÷ 7: 7*14=98, so 100 -98=2. So, 100 ≡ 2 mod 7.
- 10 ÷7 is 3 with remainder 1, so 10 ≡ 3 mod 7.
- 1 ≡1 mod7.

So, 1000 ≡6, 100≡2, 10≡3, and 1≡1 mod7.

So, let's rewrite each condition.

1. Changing W to 1: 1*1000 + X*100 + Y*10 + Z ≡0 mod7
   So, 6 + 2X +3Y + Z ≡0 mod7.

2. Changing X to 1: W*1000 +1*100 + Y*10 + Z ≡0 mod7
   So, 6W + 2 + 3Y + Z ≡0 mod7.

3. Changing Y to 1: W*1000 + X*100 +1*10 + Z ≡0 mod7
   So, 6W +2X +3 + Z ≡0 mod7.

4. Changing Z to 1: W*1000 + X*100 + Y*10 +1 ≡0 mod7
   So, 6W +2X +3Y +1 ≡0 mod7.

So, now I have four equations:

1. 6 + 2X +3Y + Z ≡0 mod7 --> let's call this Eq1.
2. 6W +2 +3Y + Z ≡0 mod7 --> Eq2.
3. 6W +2X +3 + Z ≡0 mod7 --> Eq3.
4. 6W +2X +3Y +1 ≡0 mod7 --> Eq4.

These four equations must all hold.

Hmm, so I have four equations with variables W, X, Y, Z (all digits from 0-9, but W from 1-9).

Since N is the greatest four-digit number, we can assume that W is as large as possible, starting from 9, then X, Y, Z.

But to satisfy all four equations, the digits must satisfy these modular conditions.

Let me see if I can express these equations in terms of each other.

Let's consider Eq1 and Eq4.

From Eq1: 6 +2X +3Y + Z ≡0 mod7.

From Eq4:6W +2X +3Y +1 ≡0 mod7.

If I subtract Eq1 from Eq4, I get:

(6W +2X +3Y +1) - (6 +2X +3Y + Z) ≡0 mod7.

Simplify:

6W +2X +3Y +1 -6 -2X -3Y -Z ≡0 mod7.

Which becomes:

6W -5 - Z ≡0 mod7.

So, 6W - Z ≡5 mod7.

Similarly, let's look at Eq2 and Eq3.

From Eq2:6W +2 +3Y + Z ≡0.

From Eq3:6W +2X +3 + Z ≡0.

Subtract Eq3 from Eq2:

(6W +2 +3Y + Z) - (6W +2X +3 + Z) ≡0 mod7.

Simplify:

2 +3Y + Z -2X -3 -Z ≡0 mod7.

Which becomes:

(-1) +3Y -2X ≡0 mod7.

So, 3Y -2X ≡1 mod7.

So now, from subtracting these equations, I get two new equations:

A. 6W - Z ≡5 mod7.

B. 3Y -2X ≡1 mod7.

Let me also try subtracting other pairs.

Looking at Eq1 and Eq3:

Eq1:6 +2X +3Y + Z ≡0.

Eq3:6W +2X +3 + Z ≡0.

Subtract Eq1 from Eq3:

(6W +2X +3 + Z) - (6 +2X +3Y + Z) ≡0 mod7.

Simplify:

6W +3 -6 -3Y ≡0 mod7.

Which is 6W -3 -3Y ≡0 mod7.

Divide both sides by 3 (since 3 and 7 are coprime, this is allowed):

2W -1 - Y ≡0 mod7.

So, 2W - Y ≡1 mod7.

Call this equation C.

Similarly, subtract Eq2 from Eq4:

Eq4:6W +2X +3Y +1 ≡0.

Minus Eq2:6W +2 +3Y + Z ≡0.

So, (6W +2X +3Y +1) - (6W +2 +3Y + Z) ≡0 mod7.

Simplify: 2X +1 -2 - Z ≡0 mod7.

Which is 2X -1 - Z ≡0 mod7.

So, 2X - Z ≡1 mod7. Let's call this equation D.

So now, I have four equations:

A:6W - Z ≡5 mod7.

B:3Y -2X ≡1 mod7.

C:2W - Y ≡1 mod7.

D:2X - Z ≡1 mod7.

Hmm, perhaps I can express variables in terms of others.

From equation C: 2W - Y ≡1 mod7.

Let me solve for Y:

Y ≡2W -1 mod7.

Since Y is a digit (0-9), Y can be expressed as Y = (2W -1 +7k), where k is chosen such that Y is between 0 and9.

Similarly, from equation D:2X - Z ≡1 mod7.

So, Z ≡2X -1 mod7.

Again, Z is a digit, so Z = (2X -1 +7m), where m is chosen so that Z is between 0 and9.

From equation A:6W - Z ≡5 mod7.

But from equation D, Z ≡2X -1 mod7. So, substitute into A:

6W - (2X -1) ≡5 mod7.

Simplify:

6W -2X +1 ≡5 mod7.

Which is 6W -2X ≡4 mod7.

Divide both sides by 2 (since 2 and7 are coprime):

3W - X ≡2 mod7.

So, X ≡3W -2 mod7.

Again, X is a digit, so X can be expressed as X = (3W -2 +7n), where n is chosen so that X is between0 and9.

Similarly, from equation B:3Y -2X ≡1 mod7.

From equation C, Y ≡2W -1 mod7. So, substitute Y into equation B:

3*(2W -1) -2X ≡1 mod7.

Simplify:

6W -3 -2X ≡1 mod7.

Which is 6W -2X ≡4 mod7.

Which is the same as equation A after substitution. So, that's consistent.

So, let me summarize the relations:

1. Y ≡2W -1 mod7.

2. X ≡3W -2 mod7.

3. Z ≡2X -1 mod7.

So, if I can express X, Y, Z in terms of W, then perhaps I can find possible values.

Since W is the thousands digit, it can be from1 to9.

And N is the largest possible four-digit number, so I should start with W=9 and see if such X, Y, Z exist.

Let me try W=9.

Compute X:

X ≡3*9 -2 mod7.

3*9=27; 27-2=25; 25 mod7: 7*3=21, 25-21=4. So X≡4 mod7.

So, possible X values are 4 or 11, but since X is a digit, X=4 or X=11-7=4? Wait, 4 is already less than 7, so X=4.

So, X=4.

Now compute Y:

Y ≡2*9 -1 mod7.

2*9=18; 18-1=17; 17 mod7=3. So Y≡3 mod7.

So Y can be 3 or 10, but Y is a digit, so Y=3 or Y=10-7=3. So Y=3.

Wait, 3 is less than7, so Y=3.

Then compute Z:

Z ≡2X -1 mod7.

X=4, so 2*4=8; 8-1=7; 7 mod7=0. So Z≡0 mod7.

So Z can be 0 or7. Since Z is a digit, Z=0 or7.

So, possible Z values are0 and7.

Now, let's see the digits so far: W=9, X=4, Y=3, Z=0 or7.

But wait, N must be the largest possible four-digit number. So, to maximize N, we need the largest possible digits from left to right. So, with W=9, X=4, Y=3, but Z can be 7 or0. So, to make N as large as possible, Z should be7. So N would be 9437.

Wait, but hold on. Let me check if N=9437 satisfies the original condition.

So N=9437.

Now, let's change each digit to1 and check divisibility by7.

1. Change W to1:1437.

Check if 1437 is divisible by7.

Compute 1437 ÷7: 7*205=1435. 1437-1435=2. So remainder 2. Not divisible by7. So condition fails.

Uh-oh, problem. So even though the modular equations are satisfied, the actual number doesn't meet the condition. Hmm, so my approach might have a flaw.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in translating the modular equations.

Wait, let me re-express the equations.

Wait, when I set up the equations, I said that when you change a digit to1, the resulting number is divisible by7. So, for N=9437:

- Changing W:1437. Let's check 1437 mod7.

As above, it's 2 mod7. Not 0. So, N=9437 doesn't satisfy the condition.

Hmm, so perhaps the approach is missing something. Maybe the equations are necessary but not sufficient? Or perhaps I made a mistake in the modular setup.

Wait, let me check the equations again.

Let me
