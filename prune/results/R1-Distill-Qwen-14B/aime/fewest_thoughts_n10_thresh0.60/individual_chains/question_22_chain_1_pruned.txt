Okay, so I have this geometry problem here about a convex equilateral hexagon. Let me try to visualize it first. An equilateral hexagon means all its sides are equal in length, right? And it's convex, so all the internal angles are less than 180 degrees. Also, the problem states that all pairs of opposite sides are parallel. That's an important property.

The problem mentions a triangle formed by extending segments AB, CD, and EF. These extensions form a triangle with side lengths 200, 240, and 300. My goal is to find the side length of the hexagon.

Hmm, okay. So, the hexagon is labeled ABCDEF, so the sides are AB, BC, CD, DE, EF, and FA. Since it's equilateral, all these sides are equal. Also, opposite sides are parallel: AB || DE, BC || EF, and CD || FA.

When the problem says the triangle is formed by the extensions of AB, CD, and EF, I imagine that if we extend these sides, they meet at some points forming a triangle. Let me try to draw this mentally.

So, extending AB, CD, and EF until they meet. AB is one side, CD is another, and EF is the third. Since AB, CD, EF are sides of the hexagon, which is convex, their extensions should meet outside the hexagon to form a larger triangle.

Wait, but how exactly are these sides extended? For example, AB is a side, but to extend it, we can go beyond points A and B. Similarly for CD and EF. The triangle formed is thus the outer triangle formed by these three extensions.

Since all sides of the hexagon are equal, let's denote the length of each side as 's'. The triangle formed has sides 200, 240, and 300. So, I need a way to relate the side length 's' of the hexagon to the sides of this triangle.

I remember that in such cases, similar triangles might come into play. Maybe the triangle formed by the extensions is similar to some smaller triangles within the hexagon? Or perhaps the hexagon can be seen as a truncated version of this larger triangle.

Wait, another thought: since opposite sides of the hexagon are parallel, the hexagon might be a truncated triangle. Maybe it's like cutting off the corners of a larger triangle, resulting in a hexagon with
