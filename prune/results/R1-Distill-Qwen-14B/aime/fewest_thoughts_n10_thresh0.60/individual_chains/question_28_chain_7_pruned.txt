Okay, so I have this problem about a tetrahedron ABCD with specific edge lengths, and I need to find the distance from the incenter (the point equidistant from all faces) to each face. The distance should be expressed in a particular form, and then I have to find the sum m + n + p.

First, I remember that in a tetrahedron, the inradius can be found using the formula involving the volume and the surface area. The formula is similar to the 2D case where the inradius r = A/s, where A is the area and s is the semiperimeter. For a tetrahedron, I think the formula is r = 3V / A, where V is the volume and A is the total surface area. Wait, let me think again. In 3D, the inradius is related to the volume and the "total surface area" in a way. Specifically, the formula is r = 3V / A, where A is the sum of the areas of all four faces. Yeah, that sounds right because volume can also be expressed as (1/3) * base area * height, and here the height would relate to the inradius.

So, my plan is:
1. Find the volume V of the tetrahedron.
2. Find the areas of each of the four faces.
3. Sum the areas to get the total surface area A.
4. Plug V and A into the inradius formula r = 3V / A.
5. Simplify the expression to get it in the required form.

Now, let's tackle each step.

First, I need the volume of the tetrahedron. The tetrahedron has edges with given lengths, but they aren't all the same. The edges are given in pairs: AB = CD = sqrt(41), AC = BD = sqrt(80), and BC = AD = sqrt(89). So, the opposite edges are equal. That seems symmetrical, so maybe the tetrahedron is isohedral or something. But not sure if it's regular, since the edges are different.

Wait, an isosceles tetrahedron is a tetrahedron where opposite edges are equal, which is the case here. So, I recall that for an isosceles tetrahedron, there are some properties we can exploit to calculate volume. Like, the volume can be calculated using the formula involving the edges. Alternatively, maybe I can use coordinates to compute the volume.

Let me try the coordinate approach because it's more concrete. I can place the tetrahedron in 3D space in such a way that the calculations are easier.

Let me assign coordinates to the vertices:

Letâ€™s place vertex A at (x, y, z), vertex B at (a, b, c), vertex C at (d, e, f), and vertex D at (g, h, i). But that's maybe too general. Perhaps I can place it more cleverly.

Since opposite edges are equal, perhaps the tetrahedron is symmetrical in some way. Let me think about how to arrange the points so that the opposite edges are equal.

Wait, I remember that in an isosceles tetrahedron, the opposite edges are equal, and the tetrahedron can be inscribed in a rectangular box. So, perhaps I can model the tetrahedron as formed by connecting alternate vertices of a box.

Yes, that might work. Let's try that.

Suppose I have a box with side lengths p, q, r. Then, placing the tetrahedron's vertices at four alternate vertices of the box. Then, the edges of the tetrahedron will correspond to the face diagonals of the box. Since opposite edges of the tetrahedron are equal, this should work.

So, in this case, the edges of the tetrahedron would be face diagonals of the box. Let me recall that in such a setup, the edges of the tetrahedron would be sqrt(p^2 + q^2), sqrt(q^2 + r^2), and sqrt(r^2 + p^2), each appearing twice.

Wait, in our problem, the edges are sqrt(41), sqrt(80), sqrt(89). So, perhaps sqrt(41) corresponds to sqrt(p^2 + q^2), sqrt(80) to sqrt(q^2 + r^2), and sqrt(89) to sqrt(r^2 + p^2). Or some permutation of that.

So, let me set up equations:

Let me say:
AB = sqrt(41) = sqrt(p^2 + q^2)
AC = sqrt(80) = sqrt(q^2 + r^2)
AD = sqrt(89) = sqrt(r^2 + p^2)

Is that a consistent setup? Let me check.

So, if I set up the box with sides p, q, r, and assign the edges of the tetrahedron as
