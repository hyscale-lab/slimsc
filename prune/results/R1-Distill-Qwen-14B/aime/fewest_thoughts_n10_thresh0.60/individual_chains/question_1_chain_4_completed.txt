Okay, so I have this problem with logarithms and three variables x, y, z. The equations given are all logarithms base 2, which is good because it might make things a bit simpler. The goal is to find |log₂(x⁴y³z²)| and express it as a fraction m/n where m and n are coprime, then find m + n. 

Let me write down the equations first to get a clear picture.

1. log₂(x / (y z)) = 1/2
2. log₂(y / (x z)) = 1/3
3. log₂(z / (x y)) = 1/4

Hmm. So each equation is a logarithm of a ratio of one variable over the product of the other two. Since all the logs are base 2, maybe I can convert these into exponential form to make them easier to handle.

Starting with the first equation: log₂(x / (y z)) = 1/2. Converting that, it becomes x / (y z) = 2^(1/2), which is sqrt(2). So x = y z * sqrt(2). Let me write that down:

x = y z * 2^(1/2)  ...(1)

Similarly, the second equation: log₂(y / (x z)) = 1/3. Converting, y / (x z) = 2^(1/3). So y = x z * 2^(1/3). Let me note that:

y = x z * 2^(1/3)  ...(2)

Third equation: log₂(z / (x y)) = 1/4. So z / (x y) = 2^(1/4), which implies z = x y * 2^(1/4). So:

z = x y * 2^(1/4)  ...(3)

Now I have three equations, each expressing one variable in terms of the other two and a power of 2. Maybe I can substitute these equations into each other to find expressions for x, y, z in terms that can be solved.

Let me see. From equation (1), x is expressed in terms of y and z. From equation (2), y is expressed in terms of x and z. But since equation (1) has x in terms of y and z, perhaps I can substitute equation (2) into equation (1) to express x in terms of z and then substitute into equation (3), or something like that.

Wait, maybe it's better to express all variables in terms of one variable. Let me try expressing y and z in terms of x, then substitute back.

Wait, actually, maybe another approach. Let me take all three equations and express the ratios. Let me see:

From equation (1): x / (y z) = 2^(1/2)  ...(1a)

From equation (2): y / (x z) = 2^(1/3)  ...(2a)

From equation (3): z / (x y) = 2^(1/4)  ...(3a)

If I multiply all three equations together, I get:

(x / (y z)) * (y / (x z)) * (z / (x y)) = 2^(1/2) * 2^(1/3) * 2^(1/4)

Simplify the left side:

The numerator is x * y * z. The denominator is y z * x z * x y.

Wait, let me compute step by step.

First, each fraction:

First term: x/(y z)
Second term: y/(x z)
Third term: z/(x y)

Multiply them:

(x/(y z)) * (y/(x z)) * (z/(x y)) ) = (x * y * z) / (y z * x z * x y)

Simplify numerator and denominator:

Numerator: x y z

Denominator: y z * x z * x y = (y z)(x z)(x y) = x^2 y^2 z^2

Wait, no. Let me compute the denominator step by step:

(y z) * (x z) * (x y) = y z * x z * x y

Group the terms:

= (y * x * x) * (z * z) * y
Wait, no. Let me think in terms of exponents.

Each variable in the denominator:

x appears in two terms: x z and x y, so x^2

y appears in two terms: y z and x y, so y^2

z appears in two terms: y z and x z, so z^2

Wait, no. Let me see:

The denominator is (y z) * (x z) * (x y) 

= y * z * x * z * x * y

= x^2 y^2 z^2

Because x appears twice, y appears twice, z appears twice.

So denominator is x^2 y^2 z^2.

Numerator is x y z.

So the entire product is (x y z)/(x^2 y^2 z^2) = 1/(x y z) = 2^(1/2 + 1/3 + 1/4)

Compute the exponents on the right:

1/2 + 1/3 + 1/4. Let's compute that:

Convert to common denominator, which is 12.

1/2 = 6/12, 1/3 = 4/12, 1/4 = 3/12. So 6 +4 +3=13, so 13/12

Thus, 2^(13/12)

So we have 1/(x y z) = 2^(13/12)

Which implies x y z = 2^(-13/12)

So x y z = 1 / 2^(13/12)  ...(4)

Hmm, that's a useful equation. So the product x y z is 2^(-13/12). Good.

Now, perhaps I can use this in equations (1a), (2a), (3a).

Looking back at equation (1a): x/(y z) = 2^(1/2). Since y z = (x y z)/x = (2^(-13/12))/x.

So substituting into equation (1a):

x / (y z) = x / ( (2^(-13/12))/x ) = x^2 / 2^(-13/12) = x^2 * 2^(13/12) = 2^(1/2)

So:

x^2 * 2^(13/12) = 2^(1/2)

Divide both sides by 2^(13/12):

x^2 = 2^(1/2 - 13/12) = 2^( (6/12 -13/12) ) = 2^(-7/12 )

So x^2 = 2^(-7/12 )

Taking square roots, since x is positive:

x = 2^(-7/24 )

Similarly, I can do the same for equation (2a): y/(x z) = 2^(1/3)

Again, x z = (x y z)/y = (2^(-13/12))/y

So y / (x z) = y / ( (2^(-13/12))/y ) = y^2 / 2^(-13/12) = y^2 * 2^(13/12) = 2^(1/3)

So:

y^2 * 2^(13/12) = 2^(1/3)

Divide both sides: y^2 = 2^(1/3 - 13/12 )

Compute exponent: 1/3 is 4/12, so 4/12 -13/12 = -9/12 = -3/4

So y^2 = 2^(-3/4 )

Thus, y = 2^(-3/8 )

Similarly, for equation (3a): z/(x y) = 2^(1/4)

x y = (x y z)/z = (2^(-13/12))/z

So z / (x y) = z / ( (2^(-13/12))/z ) = z^2 / 2^(-13/12) = z^2 * 2^(13/12) = 2^(1/4)

Therefore,

z^2 * 2^(13/12) = 2^(1/4 )

Divide both sides:

z^2 = 2^(1/4 - 13/12 )

Compute exponent: 1/4 is 3/12. So 3/12 -13/12 = -10/12 = -5/6

Thus, z^2 = 2^(-5/6 )

So z = 2^(-5/12 )

Wait, let me verify these exponents because it's easy to make a mistake.

For x:

From equation (1a): x/(y z) = 2^(1/2)

But y z = (y z) = (from x y z = 2^(-13/12)) => (y z) = (2^(-13/12))/x

So x / ( (2^(-13/12))/x ) = x^2 / 2^(-13/12) = x^2 * 2^(13/12) = 2^(1/2)

So x^2 = 2^(1/2 - 13/12) = 2^(6/12 -13/12) = 2^(-7/12 )

Thus x = 2^(-7/24 )

Wait, because x^2 = 2^(-7/12 ), so x = (2^(-7/12 ))^(1/2) = 2^(-7/24 )

Similarly for y:

From equation (2a): y/(x z) = 2^(1/3)

x z = (x y z)/y = 2^(-13/12)/y

Thus, y / (2^(-13/12)/y ) = y^2 * 2^(13/12) = 2^(1/3)

So y^2 = 2^(1/3 -13/12 ) = 2^(4/12 -13/12 )= 2^(-9/12 )= 2^(-3/4 )

So y = 2^(-3/8 )

And for z:

Equation (3a): z/(x y) = 2^(1/4 )

x y = (x y z)/z = 2^(-13/12)/z

So z / (2^(-13/12)/z ) = z^2 * 2^(13/12 ) = 2^(1/4 )

Thus, z^2 = 2^(1/4 -13/12 )

Which is 2^(3/12 -13/12 )= 2^(-10/12 )= 2^(-5/6 )

So z = 2^(-5/12 )

Alright, so now I have expressions for x, y, z:

x = 2^(-7/24 )

y = 2^(-3/8 )

z = 2^(-5/12 )

Now, the question is to find |log₂(x⁴ y³ z²)|.

So let's compute x⁴ y³ z².

First, express each variable raised to their respective exponents:

x⁴ = (2^(-7/24 ))^4 = 2^(-7/24 *4 )= 2^(-7/6 )

y³ = (2^(-3/8 ))^3 = 2^(-9/8 )

z² = (2^(-5/12 ))^2 = 2^(-5/6 )

Multiplying these together:

x⁴ y³ z² = 2^(-7/6 ) * 2^(-9/8 ) * 2^(-5/6 )

Since the bases are same, add the exponents:

Total exponent = (-7/6) + (-9/8) + (-5/6 )

Let me compute this step by step.

First, let's find a common denominator for the fractions. 6, 8, and 6. The least common multiple of 6 and 8 is 24.

Convert each fraction:

-7/6 = (-7 *4)/(6 *4 )= -28/24

-9/8 = (-9 *3)/(8 *3 )= -27/24

-5/6 = (-5 *4)/(6 *4 )= -20/24

Add them together:

-28/24 + (-27/24 ) + (-20/24 ) = (-28 -27 -20)/24 = (-75)/24

Simplify -75/24. Let's see, 75 and 24 are both divisible by 3.

75 ÷3 = 25, 24 ÷3=8. So it's -25/8.

So x⁴ y³ z² = 2^(-25/8 )

Therefore, log₂(x⁴ y³ z² ) = log₂(2^(-25/8 )) = -25/8.

Since the absolute value is required, | -25/8 | = 25/8.

So the value is 25/8, which is m/n=25/8. 25 and 8 are coprime, since 25 is 5² and 8 is 2³, no common factors.

Thus, m=25, n=8. So m+n=33.

Wait, but let me double-check my calculations because it's easy to make a mistake in exponents.

So starting with x =2^(-7/24 ), x⁴ is 2^(-7/24 *4)=2^(-7/6 ). Correct.

y=2^(-3/8 ), y³=2^(-9/8 ). Correct.

z=2^(-5/12 ), z²=2^(-5/6 ). Correct.

Then, x⁴ y³ z² = 2^(-7/6 -9/8 -5/6 )

Compute exponents:

-7/6 = - (7/6 )

-9/8 = - (9/8 )

-5/6 = - (5/6 )

Total: sum of the negatives.

Let me compute 7/6 +9/8 +5/6.

First, 7/6 +5/6 = (7+5)/6 =12/6=2.

Then, 2 +9/8 = 25/8.

So the sum is 25/8, so the exponent is -25/8. So yes, 2^(-25/8 )

Thus, log₂(x⁴ y³ z² )= -25/8, absolute value is 25/8.

So m=25, n=8, m +n=33.

I think that's correct. Let me just check if I've misapplied any logarithm rules.

Wait, in the beginning when I multiplied all three equations, did I compute the exponents correctly? 1/2 +1/3 +1/4.

1/2 is 6/12, 1/3 is 4/12, 1/4 is 3/12. So 6+4+3=13, 13/12. So 2^(13/12 ). Correct.

Thus, 1/(x y z )=2^(13/12 ), so x y z=2^(-13/12 ). Correct.

Then in equation (1a): x/(y z)=2^(1/2 )

Since y z= (x y z)/x = 2^(-13/12 )/x.

So x/(y z)=x / (2^(-13/12 )/x )=x² *2^(13/12 )=2^(1/2 )

So x²= 2^(1/2 -13/12 )=2^(-11/12 /2 ? Wait, hold on. Wait, 1/2 is 6/12, 13/12 is 13/12.

Wait, 1/2 =6/12, 13/12 is 13/12, so 6/12 -13/12 would be -7/12.

Ah, yes, 1/2 -13/12 = (6 -13)/12= -7/12. So x²=2^(-7/12 ), so x=2^(-7/24 ). Correct.

Similarly for y:

Equation (2a): y/(x z )=2^(1/3 )

x z=(x y z)/y=2^(-13/12 )/y

Thus, y/(x z )=y/(2^(-13/12 )/y )= y² *2^(13/12 )=2^(1/3 )

So y²=2^(1/3 -13/12 )

1/3 is 4/12, 4/12 -13/12= -9/12=-3/4. So y²=2^(-3/4 ), so y=2^(-3/8 ). Correct.

For z:

Equation (3a): z/(x y )=2^(1/4 )

x y=(x y z)/z=2^(-13/12 )/z

Thus, z/(x y )=z/(2^(-13/12 )/z )=z²*2^(13/12 )=2^(1/4 )

So z²=2^(1/4 -13/12 )

1/4 is 3/12, 3/12 -13/12= -10/12= -5/6. So z²=2^(-5/6 ), so z=2^(-5/12 ). Correct.

So all exponents correct. Then x⁴ y³ z²=2^(-25/8 ), log₂ is -25/8, absolute is 25/8.

Thus, m=25, n=8, m +n=33.

**Final Answer**
\boxed{33}


Given the system of equations involving logarithms:

1. \(\log_2\left(\frac{x}{yz}\right) = \frac{1}{2}\)
2. \(\log_2\left(\frac{y}{xz}\right) = \frac{1}{3}\)
3. \(\log_2\left(\frac{z}{xy}\right) = \frac{1}{4}\)

We convert each logarithmic equation to its exponential form:

1. \(\frac{x}{yz} = 2^{1/2}\)
2. \(\frac{y}{xz} = 2^{1/3}\)
3. \(\frac{z}{xy} = 2^{1/4}\)

Multiplying these three equations together:

\[
\left(\frac{x}{yz}\right) \left(\frac{y}{xz}\right) \left(\frac{z}{xy}\right) = 2^{1/2} \cdot 2^{1/3} \cdot 2^{1/4}
\]

Simplifying the left side:

\[
\frac{x \cdot y \cdot z}{(yz) \cdot (xz) \cdot (xy)} = \frac{1}{(xyz)}
\]

Simplifying the right side:

\[
2^{1/2 + 1/3 + 1/4} = 2^{13/12}
\]

Thus, we have:

\[
\frac{1}{xyz} = 2^{13/12} \implies xyz = 2^{-13/12}
\]

Next, we express each variable in terms of the others:

1. From \(\frac{x}{yz} = 2^{1/2}\), we get \(x = yz \cdot 2^{1/2}\).
2. From \(\frac{y}{xz} = 2^{1/3}\), we get \(y = xz \cdot 2^{1/3}\).
3. From \(\frac{z}{xy} = 2^{1/4}\), we get \(z = xy \cdot 2^{1/4}\).

Using the product \(xyz = 2^{-13/12}\), we find:

1. \(x = 2^{-7/24}\)
2. \(y = 2^{-3/8}\)
3. \(z = 2^{-5/12}\)

We need to find \(\left|\log_2(x^4 y^3 z^2)\right|\):

\[
x^4 = \left(2^{-7/24}\right)^4 = 2^{-7/6}
\]
\[
y^3 = \left(2^{-3/8}\right)^3 = 2^{-9/8}
\]
\[
z^2 = \left(2^{-5/12}\right)^2 = 2^{-5/6}
\]

Multiplying these together:

\[
x^4 y^3 z^2 = 2^{-7/6} \cdot 2^{-9/8} \cdot 2^{-5/6} = 2^{-25/8}
\]

Thus,

\[
\log_2(x^4 y^3 z^2) = \log_2(2^{-25/8}) = -\frac{25}{8}
\]

Taking the absolute value:

\[
\left|\log_2(x^4 y^3 z^2)\right| = \frac{25}{8}
\]

The fraction \(\frac{25}{8}\) is in simplest form, so \(m = 25\) and \(n = 8\). Therefore, \(m + n = 33\).

\[
\boxed{33}
\]
