Okay, so I have this problem here about a hyperbola and a rhombus. Let me try to parse it step by step.

The hyperbola is given by the equation x²/20 - y²/24 = 1. So, that's a standard hyperbola centered at the origin, opening left and right along the x-axis. The transverse axis is along the x-axis because the positive term is with x².

A rhombus ABCD is inscribed on this hyperbola, and its diagonals intersect at the origin. So, the diagonals bisect each other at the origin, which means the origin is the midpoint of both diagonals. That also suggests that the points are symmetric with respect to the origin.

Since it's a rhombus, all sides are equal in length. The diagonals of a rhombus are perpendicular bisectors of each other. So, if the diagonals are AC and BD, they intersect at the origin and are perpendicular.

We need to find the greatest real number that is less than BD² for all such rhombi. So, essentially, we're looking for the supremum (the least upper bound) of BD², but the problem asks for the greatest number that is less than BD² for all possible rhombi. Hmm, that might mean we need to find the maximum possible value of BD², but since it's a hyperbola, perhaps BD² can approach a certain limit but never actually reach it? Or maybe it can reach it in some cases. I need to think more about that.

First, let me consider the properties of the rhombus on the hyperbola. All four points A, B, C, D lie on the hyperbola. The diagonals intersect at the origin, so if A is (x, y), then C must be (-x, -y) because the origin is the midpoint. Similarly, if B is (u, v), then D must be (-u, -v). So, points are in pairs symmetric about the origin.

Since it's a rhombus, the sides are equal. So, the distance between A and B must equal the distance between B and C, and so on.

Wait, but maybe it's easier to work with the diagonals. In a rhombus, the diagonals are perpendicular. So, the diagonals AC and BD are perpendicular. So, the vectors AC and BD must be perpendicular.

Given points A and C are (-x, -y) and (x, y), so the diagonal AC is along the line connecting (x, y) and (-x, -y), which is the line y = (y/x) x, so the slope is y/x. Similarly, points B and D are at (u, v) and (-u, -v), so the diagonal BD has a slope of v/u.

Since AC and BD are perpendicular, the product of their slopes should be -1. So, (y/x) * (v/u) = -1. So, (yv)/(xu) = -1. Therefore, yv = -xu.

Alternatively, since vectors AC and BD are perpendicular, their dot product is zero. So, (2x, 2y) • (2u, 2v) = 0. Wait, wait. Let me think: the vectors AC and BD. Wait, AC is from A to C, which is (x - (-x), y - (-y)) = (2x, 2y). Similarly, BD is from B to D, which is (-u - u, -v - v) = (-2u, -2v). So, the vectors AC and BD are (2x, 2y) and (-2u, -2v). Their dot product is (2x)(-2u) + (2y)(-2v) = -4(xu + yv) = 0. So, xu + yv = 0.

So, that gives us xu + yv = 0. That's one condition.

Another condition is that all four points lie on the hyperbola. So, for point A, (x²)/20 - (y²)/24 = 1, and similarly for B, (u²)/20 - (v²)/24 = 1.

Additionally, since it's a rhombus, the lengths of the sides are equal. So, the distance between A and B must equal the distance between B and C. Let's write that condition.

The distance between A (x, y) and B (u, v) is sqrt[(u - x)² + (v - y)²]. The distance between B (u, v) and C (-x, -y) is sqrt[(-x - u)² + (-y - v)²]. Since these distances are equal, their squares must be equal:

(u - x)² + (v - y)² = (-x - u)² + (-y - v)².

Let me expand both sides:

Left side: (u² - 2ux + x²) + (v² - 2vy + y²).

Right side: (x² + 2ux + u²) + (y² + 2vy + v²).

So, setting left equal to right:

u² - 2ux + x² + v² - 2vy + y² = x² + 2ux + u² + y² + 2vy + v²

Simplify both sides by subtracting u², x², v², y² from both sides:

-2ux - 2vy = 2ux + 2vy

Bring all terms to the left:

-2ux - 2vy - 2ux - 2vy = 0

Combine like terms:

-4ux -4vy = 0

Divide both sides by -4:

ux + vy = 0

Wait, but
