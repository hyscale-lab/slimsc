Okay, so I've got this math problem to solve. Let me read it again carefully.

The problem says: Let p be the least prime number for which there exists a positive integer n such that n⁴ + 1 is divisible by p². Then, I need to find the least positive integer m such that m⁴ + 1 is divisible by p².

Hmm, right. So first, I need to find the smallest prime p where n⁴ +1 is divisible by p² for some n. Then, with that p, find the smallest m where m⁴ +1 is divisible by p².

Alright, let's try to break this down step by step.

First, I should probably look for primes p for which the equation n⁴ ≡ -1 mod p² has a solution. So, n⁴ ≡ -1 mod p². That means that -1 is a fourth power modulo p².

I remember that for primes where p ≡ 1 mod 8, the multiplicative group mod p² is cyclic, which might help. Also, for certain primes, -1 can be a quartic residue. Wait, but I'm not too sure about the exact conditions. Maybe I should look at small primes and see which one satisfies this condition.

So, let's list the primes in order and check each one. The primes are 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, etc. Let's start with p=2.

For p=2: Let's see. n⁴ +1 ≡ 0 mod 4. So, n⁴ ≡ -1 mod 4. But in mod 4, the possible residues are 0,1,2,3. Let's compute n⁴ mod 4 for n=1,2,3.

n=1: 1⁴=1 mod4=1. So 1≡-1 mod4? No, because -1 mod4 is 3.

n=2: 2⁴=16≡0 mod4. 0≡-1 mod4? No.

n=3: 3⁴=81≡1 mod4. Same as n=1, so 1≡-1? No. So no solution for p=2.

Wait, but what about n=0? n=0: 0⁴+1=1≡1 mod4, which is not 0. So, p=2 doesn't work.

Next prime: p=3. Let's check if there exists n such that n⁴ ≡ -1 mod9.

Compute n⁴ mod9 for n=1 to 8 (since mod9 has residues 0-8).

n=1: 1⁴=1 → 1 mod9=1. 1≡-1? No, since -1 mod9=8.

n=2: 16 mod9=7. 7≡-1 mod9? 8≡-1, so no.

n=3: 81 mod9=0. 0≡-1? No.

n=4: 4⁴=256. 256 mod9: 256/9=28*9=252, 256-252=4. So 4 mod9=4. Not 8.

n=5: 5⁴=625. 625/9=69*9=621, 625-621=4. So 4 mod9=4. Not 8.

n=6: 6⁴=1296. 1296/9=144, so 0 mod9. Not 8.

n=7:7⁴=2401. 2401/9: 266*9=2394, 2401-2394=7. So 7 mod9=7. Not 8.

n=8:8⁴=4096. 4096/9: 455*9=4095, 4096-4095=1. So 1 mod9=1. Not 8.

So, no solution for p=3 either. So p=3 is out.

Next prime, p=5. Let's check if there exists n such that n⁴ ≡ -1 mod25.

n⁴ ≡ 24 mod25.

Compute n⁴ mod25 for n=1 to 24. Hmm, that's a lot, but maybe we can find a pattern.

Alternatively, perhaps use Euler's
