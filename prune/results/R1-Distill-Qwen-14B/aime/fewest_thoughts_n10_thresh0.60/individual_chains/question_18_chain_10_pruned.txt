Okay, so I'm trying to solve this problem where I need to find the number of rectangles that can be formed inside a regular dodecagon. Each side of the rectangle has to lie on either a side or a diagonal of the dodecagon. Hmm, interesting.

First, I should visualize a regular dodecagon. It's a 12-sided polygon with all sides equal and all internal angles equal. Since it's regular, the symmetry should help in counting the rectangles.

I remember that in regular polygons, especially those with an even number of sides, rectangles can be formed by connecting vertices in a way that opposite sides are parallel. For a rectangle, we need two pairs of parallel sides. So, in the case of a dodecagon, I need to find sets of four vertices that form such a shape.

Wait, but the rectangle doesn't necessarily have to have sides that are sides of the dodecagon. They can also be diagonals. That complicates things a bit because the diagonals can have different lengths depending on how many vertices they skip.

So, maybe I should think about how to select four points that form a rectangle. In a regular polygon, a rectangle can be formed if the opposite sides are parallel and equal in length, and the diagonals are equal and bisect each other.

But how do I count all possible such rectangles? Maybe I can approach this by considering the properties of the dodecagon's sides and diagonals.

I recall that in any regular polygon with n sides, the number of rectangles can be calculated by considering the number of ways to choose two pairs of parallel sides. For a rectangle, we need two pairs of opposite sides, each pair being parallel and equal.

Wait, but in a dodecagon, the sides and diagonals can have different lengths. So, the sides of the rectangle could be sides of the dodecagon or diagonals of various lengths. That means I might have rectangles with sides of different lengths, but they still need to form right angles.

Alternatively, perhaps I can model the dodecagon on a coordinate system. If I place the dodecagon with its center at the origin and one vertex at (1,0), the coordinates of the vertices can be determined using polar coordinates.

The vertices would be at angles of 0°, 30°, 60°, ..., 330°, right? So each vertex can be represented as (cos θ, sin
