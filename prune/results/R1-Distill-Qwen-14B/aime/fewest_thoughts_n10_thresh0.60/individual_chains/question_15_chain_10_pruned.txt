Okay, so I need to figure out the number of paths of length 16 on an 8x8 grid that change direction exactly four times. Hmm, let's start by understanding the problem better.

First, an 8x8 grid. That means it's a grid with 8 rows and 8 columns, right? So moving from the lower left corner to the upper right corner would require moving right and up. Each move is either right (R) or up (U). Since it's an 8x8 grid, going from (0,0) to (8,8), you need 8 rights and 8 ups, totaling 16 moves. So each path is a sequence of 8 R's and 8 U's.

Now, the problem mentions paths that change direction exactly four times. That means the number of times the path switches from R to U or U to R is four. Each time the direction changes, it's a switch. So, how does that translate into the number of runs or something?

Wait, right. In a sequence of R's and U's, a run is a consecutive sequence of the same move. So if a path has four direction changes, how many runs does that correspond to? Let's think: each direction change increases the number of runs by one. Starting with the first step, suppose it's R, then if it changes to U, that's one change, increasing the runs to two. Each subsequent change adds another run.

So, if there are four direction changes, the number of runs is five. Because starting with one run, each change adds a new run. So four changes make five runs in total. So, the path will have five runs, alternating between R and U.

But wait, the direction of the first run could be either R or U. So, the five runs can start with R or U. So, there are two cases: starting with R and starting with U.

But in our case, since the grid is square, starting with R or U would be symmetric, right? Because the grid is 8x8, so the number of paths starting with R and those starting with U should be the same. So maybe I can calculate one and double it.

Wait, no. Let me think again. Because the total steps are 8 R's and 8 U's. If the path starts with R, then the runs alternate between R and U. Similarly, if it starts with U, it alternates between U and R. But since the total number of R's and U's is equal, starting with R or U might affect the number of runs.

Wait, if we have five runs, starting with R, the runs would be R, U, R, U, R. But that would mean three R runs and two U runs. But the total R's are 8, so the sum of the lengths of the R runs must be 8, same for U runs.

Similarly, if starting with U, the runs would be U, R, U, R, U. That's three U runs and two R runs. But again, the totals for R and U must be 8 each.

Wait, but in both cases, the number of runs is five. So, the number of runs is fixed. So perhaps we need to calculate the number of such sequences for both starting with R and starting with U.

But since the grid is square, maybe the number of paths starting with R is equal to those starting with U. So I can compute one and multiply by two.

Wait, but let me think about that. If I fix the starting direction, the number of such paths would depend on how the remaining steps are distributed.

So, let's structure this:

Case 1: The path starts with R.

In this case, the runs alternate R, U, R, U, R. So, three R runs and two U runs. Each run must have at least one step, so the number of ways to distribute the 8 R's into three runs and 8 U's into two runs.

Similarly, for Case 2: Starting with U, the runs would be U, R, U, R, U, so three U runs and two R runs.

So, for both cases, the number of distributions is similar, just swapping R and U.

So, let's compute the number for starting with R and then double it.

So, for starting with R, we have three R runs and two U runs.

Each R run must have at least one R, and each U run must have at least one U.

So, the number of ways to distribute 8 R's into 3 runs is equivalent to the number of integer solutions to a + b + c = 8, where a, b, c â‰¥ 1. This is a stars and bars problem. The formula is C(8-1,3-1) = C(7,2) = 21.

Similarly, the number of ways to distribute 8 U's into 2 runs is C(8-1,2-1) = C(7,1) = 7.

Since these distributions are independent, the number of sequences for starting with R is 21 * 7 = 147.

Similarly, for starting with U, it would be the same: distributing 8 U's into 3 runs and 8 R's into 2 runs. So, same calculation: 21 *7 = 147.

So total number of paths is 147 + 147 = 294.

Wait, but hold on. Is that correct?

Wait a second, no. Because in the starting with R case, the runs alternate R, U, R, U, R. So, that's three R runs and two U runs. But in the starting with U case, it's U, R, U, R, U: three U runs and two R runs.

But each run must have at least one step, so the number of ways is the same as distributing 8 steps into 3 runs for R and 2 runs for U.

Wait, but for the starting with R case, the R's are in three runs, each at least 1, and U's are in two runs, each at least 1.

Same for starting with U.

So, the number is 21 * 7 for each case, so 147 each, totaling 294.

But wait, is there a mistake here? Let me think again.

Because in both cases, the number of runs is five, but the number of runs for R and U differ depending on the starting direction.

Wait, let me think about whether the number of runs affects the count.

Wait, so for starting with R: R, U, R, U, R. So three R runs, each with at least 1 R, and two U runs, each with at least 1 U.

So, the number of ways to distribute the R's is C(8-1,3-1) = C(7,2) = 21.

Similarly, for the U's, it's C(8-1,2-1)= C(7,1)=7.

So, 21*7=147.

Same for starting with U: three U runs and two R runs.

So, 21*7=147.

So, total is 294.

But wait, is 294 the correct answer? Let me think of another way.

Another approach: the number of paths with exactly four direction
