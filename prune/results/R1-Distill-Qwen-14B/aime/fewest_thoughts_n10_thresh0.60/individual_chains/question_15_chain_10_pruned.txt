Okay, so I need to figure out how many paths of length 16 on an 8x8 grid change direction exactly four times. Hmm, let me break this down.

First, let me understand the problem. An 8x8 grid has points from (0,0) to (8,8). A path from the lower left to the upper right corner would consist of moving right and up. Since the grid is 8x8, each path will consist of 8 right moves and 8 up moves, totaling 16 moves. So, each path is a sequence of 8 R's and 8 U's.

Now, the problem says the path changes direction exactly four times. That means the path switches from moving right to up or up to right four times. So, how does that translate into the number of runs?

Wait, a run is a consecutive sequence of the same move. So for example, if I go right three times, then up twice, that's two runs. Each change in direction starts a new run.

So, if the path changes direction four times, how many runs does that correspond to? Well, every time you change direction, you start a new run. So starting with the first run (either right or up), each change adds a new run. So, if there are four direction changes, the number of runs is 5. Because starting from one run, each change increases the number by one. So four changes give five runs.

Yes, that makes sense. So each path with four direction changes corresponds to a path with five runs. Each run is a consecutive sequence of R's or U's.

So, now I need to count the number of such paths with exactly five runs, alternating between R and U.

But wait, runs can be either R or U, but they have to alternate. So the first run could be R or U, then the next run is the opposite, and so on.

Therefore, the number of such paths will be the sum of the number of paths starting with R and having five runs, and the number starting with U and having five runs.

Wait, but in our case, the path must consist of exactly 8 R's and 8 U's. So, the number of runs must be split between R and U, with possibly one more run of one direction than the other, depending on whether the number of runs is odd or even.

Wait, no. If the number of runs is five, which is odd, then the number of R runs and U runs will differ by one. Because starting with R, the runs would be R, U, R, U, R. So three R runs and two U runs. Alternatively, starting with U, it would be U, R, U, R, U. So three U runs and two R runs.

Wait, but since we have exactly 8 R's and 8 U's, we need to distribute these into runs. So, for each case (starting with R or starting with U), we can model the number of such paths.

So, let's define two cases:

Case 1: The path starts with R and has five runs, so it would go R, U, R, U, R. So, three R runs and two U runs.

Case 2: The path starts with U and has five runs, so it would go U, R, U, R, U. So, three U runs and two R runs.

In each case, the number of R's and U's must add up to 8 each.

So, for Case 1: three R runs and two U runs. Each R run has at least 1 R, each U run has at least 1 U. The total R's are 8, so the sum of R runs is 8, with three runs. Similarly, the sum of U runs is 8, with two runs.

Similarly for Case 2: three U runs and two R runs.

I can model each case using stars and bars. The number of ways to distribute 8 identical items (R's or U's) into k runs (each run at least 1) is C(8-1, k-1) = C(7, k-1).

So, for Case 1: Starting with R.

Number of ways to distribute R's: 8 R's into 3 runs. That's C(7,2).

Number of ways to distribute U's: 8 U's into 2 runs. That's C(7,1).

But wait, actually, each run must have at least one step, so yes, it's stars and bars. So the number of ways for R's is C(8-1,3-1) = C(7,2), and for U's it's C(8-1,2-1) = C(7,1).

Similarly, for Case 2: Starting with U.

Number of ways to distribute U's: 8 into 3 runs, which is C(7,2).

Number of ways to distribute R's: 8 into 2 runs, which is C(7,1).

Then, for each case, the total number of paths is the product of the number of ways for R's and U's.

So, for Case 1: C(7,2) * C(7,1).

For Case 2: C(7,2) * C(7,1).

So, the total number of paths is 2 * [C(7,2) * C(7,1)].

Wait, but let me check. For Case 1: starting with R, the run order is R, U, R, U, R. So the number of R runs is 3, U runs is 2.

Similarly, for Case 2: starting with U, the runs are U, R, U, R, U. So U runs are 3, R runs are 2.

So, for each case, the number of distributions is the same, so
