Okay, so I've got this problem here about rectangular boxes with a surface area of 54 and a volume of 23. I need to find the radius of the smallest sphere that can contain any of these boxes, and then express r squared as a fraction p/q where p and q are coprime. Finally, I have to find p + q.

Hmm, let me start by understanding what the problem is asking. We have a set of rectangular boxes, each with surface area 54 and volume 23. For each of these boxes, I need to find the smallest sphere that can contain it. Then, among all these spheres, find the one with the smallest radius. The radius squared of that smallest sphere will be a fraction, and I need to find the sum of the numerator and denominator.

Wait, no, actually, the question says "the radius of the smallest sphere that can contain each of the rectangular boxes." Hmm, maybe I misread that. So it's the smallest sphere that can contain every box in set B. That would mean the sphere has to be big enough to fit all possible boxes in B. So the sphere's radius has to accommodate the maximum possible dimension among all boxes in B.

So, to find the minimal sphere that can contain all such boxes, the sphere's diameter must be at least as large as the space diagonal of each box. Therefore, the radius is half of that space diagonal. Thus, to find the minimal r, I need to maximize the space diagonal of the boxes in B, and then divide by 2.

So, the space diagonal of a rectangular box with side lengths x, y, z is sqrt(x² + y² + z²). So, I need to maximize sqrt(x² + y² + z²) given that the surface area is 54 and the volume is 23.

But since sqrt is a monotonically increasing function, maximizing x² + y² + z² is equivalent to maximizing the space diagonal. So, it's sufficient to maximize x² + y² + z² given the constraints.

So, the problem reduces to maximizing x² + y² + z² subject to the constraints:

1. Surface area: 2(xy + yz + xz) = 54
2. Volume: xyz = 23

I remember that for optimization under constraints, Lagrange multipliers might be useful here. Alternatively, maybe using AM >= GM or other inequalities can help. Let me think.

Let me denote S = x + y + z, P = xy + yz + zx = 54/2 = 27, and V = xyz = 23.

We need to find the maximum of x² + y² + z². Note that x² + y² + z² = (x + y + z)^2 - 2(xy + yz + zx) = S² - 2P. Since P is 27, this becomes S² - 54.

So, to maximize x² + y² + z², I need to maximize S², which means I need to maximize S.

So, the problem now is to maximize S = x + y + z given that P = 27 and V = 23.

Hmm, how can I maximize x + y + z with fixed P and V?

I know that for fixed P and V, the sum S can be found, but I'm not sure about the exact relationship. Maybe I can use some inequalities.

I recall that for positive real numbers, the AM >= GM. So, (x + y + z)/3 >= (xyz)^(1/3). Plugging in the values, (S)/3 >= (23)^(1/3). So, S >= 3*(23)^(1/3). But I'm looking to maximize S, not minimize, so perhaps that's the lower bound
