Okay, so I have this math problem here that I need to solve. Let me read it again to make sure I understand it correctly.

Alice chooses a set A of positive integers. Then Bob lists all finite nonempty sets B of positive integers with the property that the maximum element of B belongs to A. Bob's list has 2024 sets. I need to find the sum of the elements of A.

Hmm, okay. So Alice picks a set A, and then Bob makes a list of all finite non-empty sets B where the maximum element of B is in A. The number of such sets is 2024, and I need to find the sum of elements in A.

Let me try to break this down. So, first, what defines a set B in Bob's list? Each set B is finite, non-empty, and its maximum element is in A. So for each element a in A, how many sets B have a as their maximum?

Well, if a is the maximum of B, then all other elements of B must be less than a. So for each a in A, the number of possible B sets with maximum a is equal to the number of non-empty subsets of the set {1, 2, ..., a-1}, because each such subset can be combined with {a} to form a set B where a is the maximum.

Wait, no, not quite. Because for a given a, the set B can include any combination of numbers less than a, but it must include a as the maximum. So the number of possible B's with maximum a is equal to the number of subsets of {1, 2, ..., a-1}, because each subset S of {1, ..., a-1} can be extended to a set S ∪ {a}, which has maximum a.

But wait, the subsets don't have to be non-empty, right? Because B must be non-empty, but S can be empty, because S ∪ {a} would just be {a}, which is non-empty.

So for each a in A, the number of B's with max a is 2^{a-1}, because each element less than a can be either included or excluded. That includes the empty set, which gives {a} when you add a.

So the total number of B's is the sum over all a in A of 2^{a-1}.

And according to the problem, this sum is 2024. So,

Sum_{a in A} 2^{a - 1} = 2024.

Our goal is to find the sum of elements in A, which is Sum_{a in A} a.

So, if I can figure out the set A such that the sum of 2^{a-1} for a in A is 2024, then I can find Sum a.

Let me write that equation again:

Sum_{a in A} 2^{a-1} = 2024.

Hmm, 2024 is a specific number. Let me see if I can represent 2024 as a sum of powers of 2. Because 2^{a-1} is a power of 2,
