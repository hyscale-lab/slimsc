Okay, so I've got this problem to solve: I need to find the largest possible real part of the expression \[(75 + 117i)z + \frac{96 + 144i}{z}\] where \( z \) is a complex number with \( |z| = 4 \). Hmm, let's see. I'm a bit rusty on complex numbers, but I'll try to work through it step by step.

First, I remember that any complex number \( z \) can be written in the form \( z = a + bi \), where \( a \) and \( b \) are real numbers. But since \( |z| = 4 \), that means \( a^2 + b^2 = 16 \). That might come in handy later.

Now, looking at the expression: \[(75 + 117i)z + \frac{96 + 144i}{z}\]. I need to find the maximum real part of this. Maybe I can simplify the expression or find a way to represent it in terms of real and imaginary parts.

Another thought: since \( |z| = 4 \), maybe it's easier to express \( z \) in polar form. So, \( z = 4e^{i\theta} \), where \( \theta \) is the argument of \( z \). That might make the expression easier to handle because multiplying and dividing by \( z \) becomes a matter of adding and subtracting exponents.

Let me try that. Let's write \( z = 4e^{i\theta} \). Then, \( 1/z = \frac{1}{4}e^{-i\theta} \). Substituting into the expression:

\[
(75 + 117i) \cdot 4e^{i\theta} + (96 + 144i) \cdot \frac{1}{4}e^{-i\theta}
\]

Simplify the constants:

First term: \( (75 * 4) + (117 * 4)i = 300 + 468i \) multiplied by \( e^{i\theta} \).

Second term: \( (96 / 4) + (144 / 4)i = 24 + 36i \) multiplied by \( e^{-i\theta} \).

So the expression becomes:

\[
(300 + 468i)e^{i\theta} + (24 + 36i)e^{-i\theta}
\]

Hmm, that looks a bit complicated, but maybe I can use Euler's formula here. Remembering that \( e^{i\theta} = \cos\theta + i\sin\theta \), and \( e^{-i\theta} = \cos\theta - i\sin\theta \).

Let me multiply out each term:

First term:
\( (300 + 468i)(\cos\theta + i\sin\theta) \)
= \( 300\cos\theta + 300i\sin\theta + 468i\cos\theta + 468i^2\sin\theta \)
Since \( i^2 = -1 \), this becomes:
= \( 300\cos\theta + 300i\sin\theta + 468i\cos\theta - 468\sin\theta \)
Combine like terms:
Real parts: \( 300\cos\theta - 468\sin\theta \)
Imaginary parts: \( (300\sin\theta + 468\cos\theta)i \)

Second term:
\( (24 + 36i)(\cos\theta - i\sin\theta) \)
= \( 24\cos\theta - 24i\sin\theta + 36i\cos\theta - 36i^2\sin\theta \)
Again, \( i^2 = -1 \), so:
= \( 24\cos\theta - 24i\sin\theta + 36i\cos\theta + 36\sin\theta \)
Combine like terms:
Real parts: \( 24\cos\theta + 36\sin\theta \)
Imaginary parts: \( (-24\sin\theta + 36\cos\theta)i \)

Now, let's add the two results together:

Real parts total:
\( (300\cos\theta - 468\sin\theta) + (24\cos\theta + 36\sin\theta) \)
= \( (300 + 24)\cos\theta + (-468 + 36)\sin\theta \)
= \( 324\cos\theta - 432\sin\theta \)

Imaginary parts total:
\( (300\sin\theta + 468\cos\theta)i + (-24\sin\theta + 36\cos\theta)i \)
= \( (300\sin\theta -24\sin\theta) + (468\cos\theta +36\cos\theta) \)i
= \( 276\sin\theta + 504\cos\theta \)i

So, the entire expression is:

\[
(324\cos\theta - 432\sin\theta) + (276\sin\theta + 504\cos\theta)i
\]

Since we're interested in the real part, that's just the first part: \( 324\cos\theta - 432\sin\theta \). We need to find the maximum value of this expression as \( \theta \) varies.

So, the problem reduces to maximizing \( 324\cos\theta - 432\sin\theta \). Hmm, I remember that expressions of the form \( A\cos\theta + B\sin\theta \) can be written as \( R\cos(\theta + \phi) \) where \( R = \sqrt{A^2 + B^2} \). Then the maximum value is \( R \).

Wait, in our case, it's \( 324\cos\theta - 432\sin\theta \). So, it's similar to \( A\cos\theta + B\sin\theta \), but B is negative. So, the maximum real part is the amplitude of this sinusoidal function.

So, let's compute \( R = \sqrt{324^2 + (-432)^2} \). Hmm, let's calculate that.

First, 324 squared: 324 * 324. Let me compute that.

324 * 300 = 97,200. 324 * 24 = 7,776. So, total 97,200 + 7,776 = 104,976.

Next, 432 squared: 432 * 432.

I recall that 400^2 = 160,000, and 32^2=1,024. But wait, 432 is 400 + 32, so (400 + 32)^2 = 400^2 + 2*400*32 + 32^2 = 160,000 + 25,600 + 1,024 = 186,624.

But since it's (-432)^2, it's the same as 432^2, which is 186,624.

So, R squared is 104,976 + 186,624 = 291,600.

So, R is sqrt(291,600). Let me compute that. Well, sqrt(291,600)
