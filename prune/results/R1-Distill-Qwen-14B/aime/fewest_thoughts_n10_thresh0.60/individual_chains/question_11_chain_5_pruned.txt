Okay, so I have this complex number problem to solve. Let me read it again: I need to find the largest possible real part of the expression (75 + 117i)z + (96 + 144i)/z, where z is a complex number with |z| = 4. Hmm, alright, where do I start?

First, let me understand what's being asked. I need to maximize the real part of a complex expression. The expression involves z and its reciprocal, and both terms have complex coefficients. Since |z| = 4, that means z lies on a circle in the complex plane with radius 4. So z can be written in polar form as z = 4e^{iθ}, where θ is the argument of z. That might simplify things because then I can express everything in terms of θ.

Let me write z as 4e^{iθ}. Then, 1/z would be (1/4)e^{-iθ} because 1/z = conjugate(z)/|z|², and since |z|=4, it's 1/4 times the conjugate of z, which in exponential form is e^{-iθ}.

So substituting z into the expression:

(75 + 117i) * 4e^{iθ} + (96 + 144i) * (1/4)e^{-iθ}.

Let me compute each part separately. Let's denote A = 75 + 117i and B = 96 + 144i. Then the expression becomes:

4A e^{iθ} + (B)/4 e^{-iθ}.

So, compute 4A and B/4. Let's see:

4A = 4*(75 + 117i) = 300 + 468i.

B/4 = (96 + 144i)/4 = 24 + 36i.

So the expression is:

(300 + 468i) e^{iθ} + (24 + 36i) e^{-iθ}.

Now, let's express this in terms of sine and cosine. Remember that e^{iθ} = cosθ + i sinθ, and e^{-iθ} = cosθ - i sinθ.

So, substituting:

(300 + 468i)(cosθ + i sinθ) + (24 + 36i)(cosθ - i sinθ).

Let me multiply each term out.

First, expand (300 + 468i)(cosθ + i sinθ):

= 300 cosθ + 300i sinθ + 468i cosθ + 468i^2 sinθ.

Since i^2 = -1, this becomes:

= 300 cosθ + 300i sinθ + 468i cosθ - 468 sinθ.

Now, group real and imaginary parts:

Real: 300 cosθ - 468 sinθ.

Imaginary: (300 sinθ + 468 cosθ) i.

Similarly, expand (24 + 36i)(cosθ - i sinθ):

= 24 cosθ - 24i sinθ + 36i cosθ - 36i^2 sinθ.

Again, i^2 = -1, so:

= 24 cosθ - 24i sinθ + 36i cosθ + 36 sinθ.

Group real and imaginary parts:

Real: 24 cosθ + 36 sinθ.

Imaginary: (-24 sinθ + 36 cosθ) i.

Now, add the two expanded expressions together. Let's add the real parts and the imaginary parts separately.

Real parts:

(300 cosθ - 468 sinθ) + (24 cosθ + 36 sinθ) =

(300 + 24) cosθ + (-468 + 36) sinθ =

324 cosθ - 432 sinθ.

Imaginary parts:

(300 sinθ + 468 cosθ) i + (-24 sinθ + 36 cosθ) i =

[300 sinθ - 24 sinθ + 468 cosθ + 36 cosθ] i =

(276 sinθ + 504 cosθ) i.

So the entire expression is:

(324 cosθ - 432 sinθ) + (276 sinθ + 504 cosθ) i.

But since we are interested in the real part, we can focus on the first part: Re = 324 cosθ - 432 sinθ.

So, Re = 324 cosθ - 432 sinθ.

We need to find the maximum value of this real part as θ varies. So, this is a function of θ: f(θ) = 324 cosθ - 432 sinθ. We can write this as R cos(θ + φ), where R is the amplitude and φ is the phase shift. The maximum value of R cos(θ + φ) is R, so the maximum real part will be R.

So, let's compute R. R is the square root of (324)^2 + (432)^2.

Compute 324 squared: 324 * 324. Let's calculate that. 300^2 = 90,000, 24^2=576, and cross term 2*300*24=14,400. So (300 +24)^2 = 300^2 + 2*300*24 +24^2 = 90,000 +14,400 + 576= 104,976.

Similarly, 432 squared: 400^2=160,000, 32^2=1,024, 2*400*32=25,600. So (400+32)^2= 160,000 +25,600 +1,024= 186,624.

So R = sqrt(104,976 + 186,624) = sqrt(291,600). Let's compute that. 500^2 is 250,000, 600^2=360,000. So 540^2=291,600. Because 500^2=250,000, 40^2=1,600, 2*500*40=40,000. So (500+40)^2=500^2 + 2*500*40 +40^2=250,000 +40,000 +1,600=291,600. So R = 540.

Wait, but hold on: f(θ) = 324 cosθ - 432 sinθ. The formula for R is sqrt(a^2 + b^2) where a and b are coefficients. So R = sqrt(324^2 + (-432)^2) = sqrt(104,976 + 186,624) = sqrt(291,600)=540. So yes, R is 540.

So the maximum value of Re is 540.

But wait a second, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in considering the sign. Because in the expression, it's 324 cosθ -432 sinθ, which can be written as R cos(θ + φ), where R is sqrt(324^2 + 432^2). Since the coefficients are 324 and -432, the formula for R is correct, regardless of the signs.

Alternatively, sometimes people write a cosθ + b sinθ as R cos(θ - φ), but the maximum is still R.

So, yes, the maximum real part is 540.

Wait, but wait, let me double-check. Let me see if I did the expansion correctly.

Original expression: (75+117i)z + (96+144i)/z. With |z|=4, so z=4e^{iθ}, 1/z=(1/4)e^{-iθ}.

So substituting:

(75+117i)*4 e
