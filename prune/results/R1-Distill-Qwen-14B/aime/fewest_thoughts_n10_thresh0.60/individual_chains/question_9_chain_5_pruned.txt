Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find real numbers x and y, both greater than 1, such that log base x of y^x equals 10, and log base y of x^{4y} also equals 10. Then, I need to find the product xy.

Hmm, let me write down the equations first so I can see them clearly. 

First equation: log_x(y^x) = 10.

Second equation: log_y(x^{4y}) = 10.

I remember that logarithms have some properties that might help here. For example, log_b(a^c) = c * log_b(a). So maybe I can simplify both equations using that property.

Starting with the first equation: log_x(y^x) = x * log_x(y) = 10. Let me denote that as equation (1).

Similarly, the second equation: log_y(x^{4y}) = 4y * log_y(x) = 10. Let's call that equation (2).

Now, I have two equations:

1) x * log_x(y) = 10

2) 4y * log_y(x) = 10

I also recall that log_b(a) is the reciprocal of log_a(b). So, log_x(y) = 1 / log_y(x). Let me write that down.

Let me set a variable to make this easier. Let’s let k = log_x(y). Then, log_y(x) would be 1/k.

Substituting into the equations:

Equation (1) becomes: x * k = 10.

Equation (2) becomes: 4y * (1/k) = 10.

So now I have:

x * k = 10 --> x = 10 / k.

And 4y / k = 10 --> 4y = 10k --> y = (10k)/4 = (5k)/2.

So now I have expressions for x and y in terms of k.

But I also know that k is log_x(y). So, k = log_x(y), which can be rewritten using the definition of logarithm as y = x^k.

Wait, that's a key point. So from k = log_x(y), we have y = x^k.

But we already have y expressed in terms of k: y = (5k)/2. So, substituting into this, we get:

(5k)/2 = x^k.

But from equation (1), x = 10 / k. So substituting that into x^k gives:

(5k)/2 = (10 / k)^k.

Hmm, this seems a bit complicated. So now we have an equation in terms of k:

(5k)/2 = (10 / k)^k.

This looks tricky because it's an equation where k appears both in the base and the exponent. I wonder if I can find a value of k that satisfies this equation.

Let me rewrite the equation:

(5k)/2 = (10 / k)^k.

Alternatively, I can write it as:

(5k)/2 = (10/k)^k.

I can take the natural logarithm of both sides to make this more manageable. Let me do that.

Taking ln on both sides:

ln[(5k)/2] = ln[(10/k)^k].

On the right side, using the logarithm power rule, ln(a^b) = b ln(a):

ln[(5k)/2] = k * ln(10/k).

So, now the equation is:

ln(5k / 2) = k * ln(10 / k).

Let me expand the right side:

k * ln(10 / k) = k * (ln(10) - ln(k)).

So, substituting back in, equation becomes:

ln(5k / 2) = k ln(10) - k ln(k).

Hmm, that's still a bit messy, but maybe I can make some substitutions or find k by trial and error.

Alternatively, perhaps I can express this in terms of other variables or use substitution.

Let me think about possible integer values for k that might satisfy this equation. Since x and y are greater than 1, k must be positive.

Let me try k = 2.

Left side: ln(5*2 / 2) = ln(5) ≈ 1.6
