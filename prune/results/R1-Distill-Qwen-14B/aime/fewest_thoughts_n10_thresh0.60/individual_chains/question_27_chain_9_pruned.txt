Okay, so I have this problem about a torus and a sphere. Let me try to visualize it first. A torus is like a donut shape, right? It's created by rotating a circle around an axis that's in the same plane as the circle but doesn't intersect it. In this case, the circle has a radius of 3, and the distance from the center of the circle to the axis of rotation is 6. So, the major radius (the distance from the center of the tube to the center of the torus) is 6, and the minor radius (the radius of the tube itself) is 3.

Now, the sphere S has a radius of 11. The torus can rest inside the sphere or outside. When it's inside, they're internally tangent along a circle with radius r_i, and when it's outside, they're externally tangent along a circle with radius r_o. I need to find the difference r_i - r_o and express it as a fraction m/n where m and n are coprime, then find m + n.

Hmm, okay, so I think the key here is to figure out the radii of the circles along which the torus and sphere are tangent in both internal and external cases. Let me break it down.

First, let's recall what it means for two surfaces to be tangent. When two surfaces are tangent, they touch at exactly one point along a circle. So, in this case, the torus and sphere touch each other along a circle. The radius of that circle will depend on the relative positions of the torus and sphere.

Let's start with the internal tangent case. The torus is inside the sphere, so the sphere is larger. The torus is touching the sphere from the inside. I need to find the radius r_i of the circle where they're tangent.

Similarly, when the torus is outside the sphere, they touch externally, and the radius of that tangent circle is r_o.

Wait, but how do I find these radii? Maybe I should think in terms of the centers. The sphere has a center, and the torus is a surface of revolution. The torus's center (if I can call it that) would be along the axis of rotation, right? So, when the torus is placed inside the sphere, the distance between their centers must be such that the torus just touches the sphere.

Let me sketch this mentally. The sphere has a radius of 11, so its center is at some point, say, the origin for simplicity. The torus is centered along the z-axis, perhaps. When it's inside the sphere, the torus is touching the sphere along a circle. So, the distance from the sphere's center to the torus's center must be such that the closest point on the torus to the sphere's center is exactly 11 (the sphere's radius).

Wait, no, because the torus is inside the sphere, so the distance from the sphere's center to the torus's center plus the maximum extent of the torus should equal the sphere's radius.

Wait, let me think again. The torus is generated by rotating a circle of radius 3 around an axis that's
