Okay, so I've got this math problem here about residents in Aimeville and the things they own. Let me try to wrap my head around it. I remember something about sets and Venn diagrams from my classes, but I'm not entirely sure how to apply it here. Let's see.

The problem says there are 900 residents. Each of them owns a bag of candy hearts. So, that's a given—everybody has candy hearts. Then, there are three other items: diamond rings, golf clubs, and garden spades. The numbers are 195 own a diamond ring, 367 own golf clubs, and 562 own a garden spade. 

Wait, so each resident owns at least the candy hearts. So, actually, the total number of residents is 900, and all of them are included in the data. So, when we talk about people owning these items, it's all relative to the 900.

Now, the problem adds that 437 residents own exactly two of these things, and 234 own exactly three of them. The question is asking for the number of residents who own all four—so, candy hearts plus diamond ring, golf clubs, and garden spade.

Hmm. I think I need to use the principle of inclusion-exclusion here. I've heard of that before, but I'm a bit fuzzy on the details. Let me recall. The inclusion-exclusion principle helps calculate the total number of elements in the union of multiple sets by adding the sizes of the individual sets and then subtracting the sizes of all possible intersections, adding back in the sizes of intersections of three sets, and so on. But in this case, we're dealing with four sets—candy hearts, diamond rings, golf clubs, and garden spades. But wait, since everyone owns the candy hearts, that's the universal set here. So maybe I can simplify the problem.

Wait, no, the four things are the four items each resident can own. So, each resident can own any combination of these four, but in reality, they all own at least the candy hearts. So the four items are kind of independent, but since the candy hearts are mandatory, that complicates things a bit.

Let me break it down. Let me denote:

- Let U be the universal set of residents, so |U| = 900.

- Let A be
