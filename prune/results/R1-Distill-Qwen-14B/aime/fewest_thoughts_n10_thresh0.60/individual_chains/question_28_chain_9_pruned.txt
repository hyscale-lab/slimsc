Okay, so I'm trying to solve this geometry problem about a tetrahedron. Let me first make sure I understand what's given and what I need to find.

We have a tetrahedron ABCD. The edges opposite each other have specific lengths: AB and CD are both √41, AC and BD are both √80, and BC and AD are both √89. So, it seems like the tetrahedron is "edge-symmetric" in a way. 

The question is about finding the distance from a special point inside the tetrahedron to each of its four faces. This point is called the incenter, I think, similar to the incenter of a triangle. For a tetrahedron, the incenter is the point equidistant from all four faces, and that distance is called the inradius. So, I need to find the inradius of this tetrahedron.

The answer should be in the form m√n/p, where m and p are coprime, and n is square-free. Then, I have to find m + n + p.

Hmm, okay. I remember that for a tetrahedron, the inradius can be found using the formula:

r = 3V / S

Where V is the volume of the tetrahedron, and S is the total surface area. So, to find r, I'll need both the volume and the surface area.

First, let's tackle the surface area. Since it's a tetrahedron, there are four triangular faces. If I can find the area of each face, I can sum them up to get S.

Looking at the edges, each pair of opposite edges has the same length. So, each face is a triangle with two sides of one length and one side of another length. Wait, no, actually, because in a tetrahedron, each face is a triangle, and each face is made up of three edges. But given the opposite edges are equal, perhaps all the faces are congruent? Hmm, let me think.

Wait, no. For example, face ABC has edges AB, BC, AC. AB is √41, BC is √89, AC is √80. Similarly, face ABD has edges AB, BD, AD. AB is √41, BD is √80, AD is √89. So, each face is a triangle with sides √41, √80, √89.

Wait, so all four faces are congruent triangles? Because each face has sides of lengths √41, √80, and √89. So, all four faces are congruent. Therefore, all four faces have the same area. So, if I find the area of one face, I can multiply by four to get the total surface area S.

So, let's compute the area of one face. Let's take triangle ABC with sides a = √41, b = √89, c = √80.

I can use Heron's formula for the area of a triangle. Heron's formula says that the area is √[s(s - a)(s - b)(s - c)], where s is the
