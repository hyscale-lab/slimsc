Okay, so I've got this math problem here about paths on an 8x8 grid. The task is to find the number of paths of length 16 that change direction exactly four times. Hmm, let me try to break this down.

First, I know that on an 8x8 grid, moving from the lower left to the upper right corner, you have to move right 8 times and up 8 times, right? So each path is a sequence of 8 rights (R) and 8 ups (U). The total number of paths without any restrictions is the combination of 16 moves taken 8 at a time, which is C(16,8). But that's without any direction change restrictions.

But this problem is asking about paths that change direction exactly four times. Hmm, changing direction means switching from moving right to up or up to right. So, each time the direction changes, it's a switch between R and U.

Wait, so if a path changes direction exactly four times, how many segments of R and U will it have? Let me think. Each direction change adds a new segment. If you start with, say, R, then the first change will make it U, then another change R, etc. So, four direction changes would mean five segments in total. Because each change adds a new segment.

Wait, so if you have four direction changes, you have five segments. Now, since the path starts with either R or U, the number of R segments and U segments will differ by at most one. So, if there are five segments, they could be arranged as three R and two U, or three U and two R. Wait, no, let me think again.

No, actually, if you start with R, then the number of R segments will be one more than the number of U segments if the number of direction changes is even. Wait, maybe I should model this more carefully.

Let me think: suppose the path starts with R. Each direction change switches to U, then R, etc. So, the number of R segments would be (number of direction changes + 1)/2 if the number of direction changes is odd. Wait, but in our case, it's four direction changes. So, four is even, so number of R segments would be (4/2) + 1 = 3, and U segments would be 2, or vice versa if starting with U.

Wait, no. Let me think again. If you start with R, and change direction four times, you'd alternate R, U, R, U, R, U, R. So that's four changes, which makes five segments, with three R and two U. Similarly, if you start with U, you'd have three U and two R.

So, the path must consist of five segments, either three R and two U or three U and two R. Wait, but each segment must consist of at least one step, right? Because you can't have a segment of zero length.

So, for each case, we need to count the number of ways to arrange these segments.

Wait, so the problem reduces to counting the number of such paths that start with R, have three R segments and two U segments, and change direction four times, plus those that start with U, have three U segments and two R segments.

But wait, no, because starting with R gives three R segments and two U segments, and starting with U gives three U segments and two R segments, each resulting in four direction changes.

So, let's calculate each case separately.

Case 1: Starting with R.

We have three R segments and two U segments. Each R segment must have at least one R, and each U segment must have at least one U.

So, the number of R's is 8, which are split into three segments. The number of ways to split 8 R's into three segments, each at least 1, is C(8-1,3-1) = C(7,2) = 21.

Similarly, the number of U's is 8, split into two segments, each at least one, so C(8-1,2-1) = C(7,1) = 7.

So, for the starting with R case, the number of paths is 21 * 7 = 147.

Similarly, Case 2: Starting with U.

Here, we have three U segments and two R segments.

Number of ways to split 8 U's into three segments: C(7,2) = 21.

Number of ways to split 8 R's into two segments: C(7,1) = 7.

So, the number of paths here is also 21 * 7 = 147.

Therefore, the total number of paths that change direction exactly four times is 147 + 147 = 294.

Wait, but wait a second. Let me make sure I didn't miss anything here.

Each direction change corresponds to a switch between R and U. So, the way I've calculated, each case has five segments, which requires four direction changes. So, that seems correct.

But let me think about another way to approach this, maybe using the concept of runs.

The number of runs of R's and U's is equal to the number of direction changes plus one. So, four direction changes mean five runs.

So, the number of runs can be either starting with R or U. So, for each case, the number of ways to distribute the steps.

Yes, that's consistent with what I did before.

So, in each case, the number of ways is (number of ways to split R's into k segments) multiplied by (number of ways to split U's into m segments), where k + m = total runs, which is five.

In our case, for starting with R, number of R runs is three, U runs is two. So, the number of ways is C(8-1,3-1) * C(8-1,2-1) = C(7,2)*C(7,1).

Which is 21 * 7 = 147.

Similarly for starting with U, it's the same, so 147 again.

So, adding them gives 294.

Wait, but wait a moment. Is there a possibility that some paths could have more direction changes but still fit into this four direction change count? No, because each time you switch direction, you're adding a new run. So, five runs imply four direction changes, which is exactly what the problem is asking for.

So, is 294 the correct answer? Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps I can model this using stars and bars.

The number of ways to split 8 R's into k segments is C(8-1, k-1). Similarly for U's.

So, in this case, for starting with R, we have three R segments and two U segments.

So, the number of ways is C(7,2) * C(7,1) = 21 *7 =147.

Similarly for starting with U, it's the same.

Total 294.

So, I think that's correct. I don't see any mistakes in the reasoning. So, the answer should be 294.


To solve the problem of finding the number of paths of length 16 on an 8x8 grid that change direction exactly four times, we consider the following steps:

1. **Understanding the Grid and Paths**: Each path from the lower left to the upper right corner consists of 8 right (R) moves and 8 up (U) moves, totaling 16 moves.

2. **Direction Changes and Segments**: A direction change occurs when transitioning from R to U or U to R. Changing direction exactly four times means the path consists of five segments (runs). These runs can either start with R and have three R segments and two U segments, or start with U and have three U segments and two R segments.

3. **Calculating Paths for Each Case**:
   - **Case 1: Starting with R**  
     - Split 8 R's into 3 segments: \( \binom{8-1}{3-1} = \binom{7}{2} = 21 \) ways.  
     - Split 8 U's into 2 segments: \( \binom{8-1}{2-1} = \binom{7}{1} = 7 \) ways.  
     - Total for this case: \( 21 \times 7 = 147 \) paths.
   - **Case 2: Starting with U**  
     - Split 8 U's into 3 segments: \( \binom{7}{2} = 21 \) ways.  
     - Split 8 R's into 2 segments: \( \binom{7}{1} = 7 \) ways.  
     - Total for this case: \( 21 \times 7 = 147 \) paths.

4. **Total Paths**: Adding both cases gives \( 147 + 147 = 294 \) paths.

Thus, the number of paths of length 16 that change direction exactly four times is:

\boxed{294}
