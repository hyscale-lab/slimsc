Okay, let's try to figure out this problem. So, Alice chooses a set A of positive integers. Then Bob lists all finite nonempty sets B of positive integers where the maximum element of B is in A. Bob's list has 2024 sets. We need to find the sum of the elements of A.

Hmm, so let me break this down. Alice picks some set A, and then Bob considers all possible finite nonempty sets B where the maximum element is in A. The total number of such sets B is 2024. Our goal is to find the sum of elements in A.

First, I think I need to understand how Bob is generating these sets B. Each B is a finite nonempty set of positive integers, and its maximum must be in A. So for each element a in A, all possible sets B where the maximum element is exactly a. Then, the total number of such sets is the sum over each a in A of the number of subsets of positive integers less than a, because for each a, you can have any subset of {1, 2, ..., a-1} combined with a to form B.

Wait, that makes sense. For a given a, the number of possible B sets where max(B) = a is equal to the number of subsets of {1, 2, ..., a-1}, since each such subset can be combined with a to form a set B with maximum a. But wait, the subsets can be empty? Because if the subset is empty, then B is just {a}. Oh, but in the problem statement, B is a finite nonempty set, so {a} is allowed.

So, for each a in A, the number of B sets with maximum a is 2^{a-1}. Because each element less than a can be either included or not in B, giving 2^{a-1} subsets. So, for each a, the number of such B is 2^{a-1}.

Therefore, the total number of B sets is the sum over all a in A of 2^{a-1}. And according to the problem, this sum is 2024.

So, mathematically, that's:

Sum_{a in A} 2^{a-1} = 2024.
