Okay, so I've got this problem about coloring the vertices of a regular octagon either red or blue. Each vertex is colored independently with equal probability, so that's a 50-50 chance for each color. The question is asking about the probability that after coloring, there's a rotation of the octagon such that all the blue vertices end up where there were originally red vertices. And they want the answer as a fraction m/n where m and n are coprime, and then m + n.

Hmm, I need to figure out how many colorings satisfy this condition and then divide that by the total number of possible colorings, which is 2^8 since each of the 8 vertices can be red or blue.

So first, let's think about what it means for the octagon to be rotatable so that all blue vertices align with the original red ones. Essentially, we're looking for colorings where the set of blue vertices is a rotation of the set of red vertices. Because if you can rotate the octagon such that blue vertices go where reds were, that implies that the blue set is just a rotated version of the red set.

Wait, but the octagon is regular, so it's symmetric. That means that any rotation is just a cyclic permutation of the vertices. So maybe the condition is that the blue set is a rotation of the red set. But since red and blue are both colorings, maybe the blue set is a translate (rotationally shifted) version of the red set.

But hold on, the octagon has rotational symmetry of order 8, meaning it can be rotated in steps of 45 degrees, which would cycle the vertices. So if the blue set is a rotation of the red set, then the number of blue vertices must equal the number of red vertices, right? Because they're just rotations of each other. So, that means that in such a case, the octagon must have exactly 4 blue and 4 red vertices. Because 8 is even, and if it's a rotation, they can't have different numbers. So, that might give me a condition: the number of blue vertices must be 4. Because otherwise, it's impossible for their sets to be rotations of each other.

Wait, but the problem says "the probability that the octagon can then be rotated so that all of the blue vertices end up at positions where there were originally red vertices." So, maybe it's not that the blue set is a rotation of the red set, but that when you rotate the octagon, the blue vertices move to where the reds were. So, perhaps the blue set is a shifted version of the red set.

Wait, but the initial red and blue colors are fixed. Let me think about it as a permutation. When you rotate the octagon, each vertex moves to a new position. So, if you have a coloring where the blue vertices are in positions that, when rotated by some k steps, become the red positions, then that coloring satisfies the condition.

So, more formally, for a given coloring, suppose there exists a rotation by k steps (k = 0,1,...,7) such that for every vertex i, if the original color was blue, then the color at position (i + k) mod 8 is red. Or wait, perhaps it's that for each vertex i, the color at position (i + k) mod 8 was red,
