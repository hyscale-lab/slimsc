Okay, so I have this problem about counting paths on an 8x8 grid. The paths are from the lower left corner to the upper right corner, and they have a specific length of 16. I need to find how many such paths change direction exactly four times. Hmm, let's try to break this down.

First, I remember that in grid paths, usually, you can only move right or up. But in this case, since it's an 8x8 grid, starting from (0,0) to (8,8), each path consists of 8 rights and 8 ups, making a total of 16 moves. So, the total number of such paths without any restrictions is the combination C(16,8). But here, we have an additional condition: the path must change direction exactly four times.

Wait, changing direction exactly four times. So, each time the path changes direction, it must switch from moving right to up or from up to right. So, if it changes direction four times, how does that affect the path structure?

Let me think. Each time the path changes direction, it's like switching from one direction to another. So, if I have four direction changes, how many segments does that create? Well, starting with the first direction, each change adds a new segment. So, four changes would mean five segments in total. Because the first segment is the initial direction, then each change adds a new segment.

So, we'll have five segments. Each segment is a consecutive series of moves in the same direction. Now, these segments can be either right or up moves, but they have to alternate. So, the path alternates between right and up segments.

Wait, but the starting direction could be either right or up. So, the first segment could be right or up. That would affect the rest of the path.

But wait, in an 8x8 grid, you have to end at (8,8), so the number of right moves and up moves must each be 8. So, the sum of the lengths of the right segments must be 8, and the same for the up segments.

Given that we have five segments, and they alternate between right and up, let's consider two cases:

1. The first segment is a right move. Then the segments will be right, up, right, up, right, up, right, up, right, up. Wait, no, that's more
