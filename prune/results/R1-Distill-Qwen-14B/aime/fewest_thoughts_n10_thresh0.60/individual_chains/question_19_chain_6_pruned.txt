Okay, so I've got this geometry problem here: Triangle ABC has circumcenter O and incenter I. It says that IA is perpendicular to OI. The circumradius is 13, and the inradius is 6. I need to find AB multiplied by AC. Hmm, interesting.

First, let me recall some properties about triangle centers. The circumradius R is given as 13, and the inradius r is 6. So, R = 13, r = 6. The incenter I is where the angle bisectors meet, and the circumcenter O is where the perpendicular bisectors meet. Now, in this triangle, IA is perpendicular to OI. That seems like a key piece of information.

I remember that in any triangle, the distance between the incenter and circumcenter can be found using the formula: OI² = R(R - 2r). Wait, is that correct? Let me think. Oh yeah, I think that's right. So, plugging in the values: OI² = 13*(13 - 2*6) = 13*(13 - 12) = 13*1 = 13. So, OI = sqrt(13). That's the length between O and I.

But wait, the problem says IA is perpendicular to OI. So, triangle IOA is a right triangle, right-angled at I. Because IA is perpendicular to OI. So, in triangle IOA, we have a right angle at I, with sides OI, IA, and OA.

I know OA is the circumradius, which is 13. OI is sqrt(13), and IA is the length from inradius to vertex A. Wait, IA isn't the inradius. The inradius is the distance from I to any side, not from I to a vertex. So, IA is the length of the segment from incenter I to vertex A. I think there's a formula for that.

Yes, the formula for the length of the inradius to a vertex is IA = sqrt(r² + (s - a)²), where s is the semiperimeter and a is the side opposite vertex A. Wait, or is it something else? Maybe I should think about coordinates or vector approaches, but that might get complicated.

Alternatively, in triangle IOA, which is right-angled at I, we can apply Pythagoras' theorem. So, OA² = OI² + IA². OA is 13, OI is sqrt(13). Let's plug in the numbers:

13² = (sqrt(13))² + IA²
169 = 13 + IA²
So, IA² = 169 - 13 = 156
Thus, IA = sqrt(156) = 2*sqrt(39)

So, IA is 2√39. Hmm, that's useful.

Now, I need to find AB * AC. Let me denote the sides opposite to A, B, C as a, b, c respectively. So, BC = a, AC = b, AB = c. Then, AB * AC is c * b.

I remember that in a triangle, the product of two sides can be related to the area and other elements. Also, knowing the inradius and semiperimeter might help. The area is r * s, where s is the semiperimeter. So, area Δ = r * s = 6s.

Also, area can be expressed using the circumradius: Δ = (a*b*c)/(4R). So, Δ = (a*b*c)/(4*13) = (a*b*c)/52.

But since Δ is also 6s, we have 6s = (a*b*c)/52, so 6s * 52 = a*b*c. Which gives a*b*c = 312s.

Hmm, that might come in handy later.

Let me also
