Okay, so I've got this problem here with three variables x, y, and z, all positive real numbers. They satisfy a system of three logarithmic equations, and I need to find the absolute value of log base 2 of (x^4 y^3 z^2), then express it as a fraction m/n where m and n are coprime, and then find m + n. 

Let me write down the equations first to get a clear picture.

The equations are:
1. log₂(x / (y z)) = 1/2
2. log₂(y / (x z)) = 1/3
3. log₂(z / (x y)) = 1/4

Hmm, logarithms can sometimes be tricky, but I remember that log_b(a) = c is equivalent to b^c = a. So maybe I can rewrite these equations in exponential form to make them easier to handle.

Starting with the first equation:
log₂(x / (y z)) = 1/2
This means 2^(1/2) = x / (y z). So, sqrt(2) = x / (y z). Let me write that as equation (1a):
x = y z sqrt(2)  --> (1a)

Similarly, the second equation:
log₂(y / (x z)) = 1/3
So, 2^(1/3) = y / (x z). Let me write that as equation (2a):
y = x z * 2^(1/3)  --> (2a)

Third equation:
log₂(z / (x y)) = 1/4
Which means 2^(1/4) = z / (x y). Equation (3a):
z = x y * 2^(1/4)  --> (3a)

Now, I have three equations (1a, 2a, 3a) that relate x, y, z. My goal is to find log₂(x^4 y^3 z^2). Let me denote that expression as E for simplicity.

E = log₂(x^4 y^3 z^2) = 4 log₂ x + 3 log₂ y + 2 log₂ z

But maybe it's easier to express everything in terms of logarithms. Let me define:
Let a = log₂ x
Let b = log₂ y
Let c = log₂ z

So, E = 4a + 3b + 2c

Now, I need to find a, b, c.

Looking back at the three original equations, let's take the logarithm base 2 of both sides of each equation (1a, 2a, 3a) because logarithms can help linearize the multiplicative relationships.

Starting with equation (1a):
x = y z sqrt(2)
Taking log₂ of both sides:
log₂ x = log₂ (y z sqrt(2)) = log₂ y + log₂ z + log₂ sqrt(2)
Which simplifies to:
a = b + c + (1/2)   --> because log₂ sqrt(2) is log₂ 2^(1/2) = 1/2

Similarly, equation (2a):
y = x z * 2^(1/3)
Taking log₂:
log₂ y = log₂ x + log₂ z + log₂ 2^(1/3)
Which simplifies to:
b = a + c + (1/3)

Equation (3a):
z = x y * 2^(1/4)
Taking log₂:
log₂ z = log₂ x + log₂ y + log₂ 2^(1/4)
Which simplifies to:
c = a + b + (1/4)

So now I have a system of three equations with a, b, c:
1. a = b + c + 1/2   --> Equation (1b)
2. b = a + c + 1/3   --> Equation (2b)
3. c = a + b + 1/4   --> Equation (3b)

Hmm, this is a linear system. Let me write them down clearly:

Equation (1b): a = b + c + 1/2
Equation (2b): b = a + c + 1/3
Equation (3b): c = a + b + 1/4

I can try to solve for a, b, c using substitution or elimination. Let's try substitution.

From equation (1b): a = b + c + 1/2 --> Let's substitute a in equations (2b) and (3b).

Substituting a into equation (2b):
b = (b + c + 1/2) + c + 1/3
Simplify:
b = b + c + 1/2 + c + 1/3
b = b + 2c + 5/6

Subtract b from both sides:
0 = 2c + 5/6
So, 2c = -5/6 --> c = -5/(12)

Wait, that's interesting. c is negative. But z is a positive real number, so log₂ z can be negative if z is between 0 and 1. That's possible, I guess.

So c = -5/12

Now, let's substitute c into equation (1b) to find a in terms of b.

From (1b): a = b + (-5/12) + 1/2
Simplify 1/2 to 6/12: a = b -5/12 +6/12 = b +1/12

So equation (1c): a = b +1/12

Now, substitute a and c into equation (3b): c = a + b +1/4

We know c = -5/12, so:

-5/12 = (b +1/12) + b +1/4

Simplify RHS:

b +1/12 + b +1/4 = 2b + (1/12 + 3/12) = 2b +4/12 = 2b +1/3

So equation becomes:
-5/12 = 2b +1/3

Convert 1/3 to 4/12 for easy subtraction:
-5/12 = 2b +4/12

Subtract 4/12 from both sides:
-9/12 = 2b

Which simplifies to:
-3/4 = 2b --> b = -3/8

So b = -3/8

Now, from equation (1c): a = b +1/12 = (-3/8) + (1/12)

Find a common denominator, which is 24:

-3/8 = -9/24
1/12 = 2/24

So a = (-9/24) + (2/24) = (-7)/24

So a = -7/24

Now we have:
a = log₂ x = -7/24
b = log₂ y = -3/8
c = log₂ z = -5/12

Now, the expression we need is E = 4a + 3b + 2c

Let's compute each term:

4a = 4*(-7/24) = -28/24 = -7/6
3b = 3*(-3/8) = -9/8
2c = 2*(-5/12) = -10/12 = -5/6

Now add them together:

E = (-7/6) + (-9/8) + (-5/6)

First, let's find a common denominator. 6, 8, 6. The least common multiple is 24.

Convert each fraction:

-7/6 = (-28)/24
-9/8 = (-27)/24
-5/6 = (-20)/24

Adding them:
(-28) + (-27) + (-20) = (-75)

So E = (-75)/24

Simplify this fraction. Let's see, 75 and 24 share a common factor of 3.

75 ÷3=25, 24 ÷3=8. So E = -25/8

But the problem asks for the absolute value of E, so |E| = | -25/8 | =25/8

25 and 8 are coprime since 25 is 5² and 8 is 2³, no common factors.

So m=25, n=8. m + n= 25+8=33

Wait, but let me double-check my steps because I don't want to make a mistake.

First, when I converted the equations into (1b), (2b), (3b), let me confirm:

Equation (1a): x = y z sqrt(2)
log₂ x = log₂ y + log₂ z + log₂ sqrt(2) = b + c + 1/2 --> correct.

Equation (2a): y = x z * 2^(1/3)
log₂ y = log₂ x + log₂ z + 1/3 = a + c + 1/3 --> correct.

Equation (3a): z = x y * 2^(1/4)
log₂ z = log₂ x + log₂ y + 1/4 = a + b +1/4 --> correct.

So the linear equations are correctly transformed.

Then, solving equation (2b):

Starting with equation (2b): b = a + c +1/3

But a was expressed as a = b + c +1/2 from equation (1b). So substituting into (2b):

b = (b + c +1/2) + c +1/3
= b + 2c + 5/6

Then subtract b from both sides: 0 = 2c +5/6
So c= -5/12 --> correct.

Then equation (1c): a = b +1/12

Substituting into equation (3b):

c = a + b +1/4
-5/12 = (b +1/12) + b +1/4
= 2b + (1/12 + 3/12)
Wait, 1/4 is 3/12. So 2b + 4/12 = 2b +1/3

So equation:
-5/12 = 2b +4/12
Subtract 4/12: -9/12 = 2b --> -3/4 =2b --> b= -3/8. Correct.

Then a = b +1/12 = (-3/8) +1/12

Convert to 24ths:

-3/8 = -9/24
