Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the number of triples of nonnegative integers (a, b, c) that satisfy two conditions: a + b + c = 300 and a²b + a²c + b²a + b²c + c²a + c²b = 6,000,000. Hmm, let's break this down.

First, the equation a + b + c = 300. That's straightforward. It's a linear equation, and since a, b, c are nonnegative integers, this is a classic stars and bars problem, except here we have a second condition to satisfy as well.

The second equation is a bit more complicated: a²b + a²c + b²a + b²c + c²a + c²b = 6,000,000. Let me see if I can factor this expression somehow. Looking at the terms, I notice that each term is a product of two variables, where one is squared. Let me try to factor it.

I can factor out a common term in each pair. For example, a²b + a²c can be written as a²(b + c). Similarly, b²a + b²c becomes b²(a + c), and c²a + c²b becomes c²(a + b). So the entire expression becomes:

a²(b + c) + b²(a + c) + c²(a + b) = 6,000,000.

Hmm, that's a bit better. Now, since a + b + c = 300, I can substitute (b + c) with (300 - a), (a + c) with (300 - b), and (a + b) with (300 - c). Let me try that.

Substituting each term:

a²(300 - a) + b²(300 - b) + c²(300 - c) = 6,000,000.

So the equation simplifies to:

300a² - a³ + 300b² - b³ + 300c² - c³ = 6,000,000.

Let me rearrange it:

300(a² + b² + c²) - (a³ + b³ + c³) = 6,000,000.

Hmm, that looks manageable. Maybe I can find expressions for a² + b² + c² and a³ + b³ + c³ in terms of a + b + c and other symmetric sums.

I know that (a + b + c)² = a² + b² + c² + 2(ab + bc + ca). Since a + b + c is 300, (300)² = a² + b² + c² + 2(ab + bc + ca). So:

a² + b² + c² = 300² - 2(ab + bc + ca) = 90,000 - 2(ab + bc + ca). Let me denote S = ab + bc + ca for simplicity.

Similarly, I recall that (a + b + c)^3 = a³ + b³ + c³ + 3(a + b)(b + c)(c + a). Wait, is that right? Alternatively, another identity: a³ + b³ + c³ = (a + b + c)^3 - 3(a + b + c)(ab + bc + ca) + 3abc. Let me double-check that.

Yes, the identity is:

a³ + b³ + c³ = (a + b + c)^3 - 3(a + b + c)(ab + bc + ca) + 3abc.

So, substituting the known values:

a³ + b³ + c³ = 300³ - 3*300*S + 3abc.

So, 300(a² + b² + c²) - (a³ + b³ + c³) = 300*(90,000 - 2S) - [300³ - 3*300*S + 3abc].

Let me compute each part step by step.

First, compute a² + b² + c²: 90,000 - 2S.

Multiply that by 300: 300*(90,000 - 2S) = 27,000,000 - 600S.

Now, compute a³ + b³ + c³: 300³ is 27,000,000. Then, subtract 3*300*S, which is 900S. Then add 3abc. So, a³ + b³ + c³ = 27,000,000 - 900S + 3abc.

Putting it back into the equation:

300(a² + b² + c²) - (a³ + b³ + c³) = (27,000,000 - 600S) - (27,000,000 - 900S + 3abc) = 6,000,000.

Let me compute that:

27,000,000 - 600S - 27,000,000 + 900S - 3abc = 6,000,000.

Simplify:

(27,000,000 - 27,000,000) + (-600S + 900S) - 3abc = 6,000,000.

So:

0 + 300S - 3abc = 6,000,000.

Divide both sides by 3:

100S - abc = 2,000,000.

So, we have:

100S - abc = 2,000,000.

Where S = ab + bc + ca.

Hmm, so now we have a relationship between S and abc. Let me write that:

100(ab + bc + ca) - abc = 2,000,000.

Hmm, this seems tricky. Let's think about how to relate S and abc. Maybe express abc in terms of S.

Wait, but S is ab + bc + ca. Maybe we can factor this equation as:

abc = 100(ab + bc + ca) - 2,000,000.

So, abc = 100S - 2,000,000.

But that might not directly help. Alternatively, maybe factor the equation:

100(ab + bc + ca) - abc = 2,000,000.

Hmm. Let me factor 100:

100(ab + bc + ca) - abc = 2,000,000.

Perhaps factor ab + bc + ca as S, but I don't see an obvious path. Maybe think about symmetric functions or try to write this in terms of symmetric polynomials.

Alternatively, perhaps try to assume that one of a, b, or c is zero. Let's see.

Suppose c = 0. Then, a + b = 300, and S = ab + 0 + 0 = ab. Then the equation becomes:

100ab - 0 = 2,000,000.

So, 100ab = 2,000,000 => ab = 20,000.

So, we have a + b = 300 and ab = 20,000.

We can solve for a and b.

The quadratic equation: x² - 300x + 20,000 = 0.

Discriminant D = 300² - 4*1*20,000 = 90,000 - 80,000 = 10,000.

So, sqrt(D) = 100.

Thus, x = [300 ± 100]/2 = (400)/2=200 or (200)/2=100.

So the solutions are (200,100,0) and (100,200,0), but since c=0, these are distinct.

Wait, but in the case of triples, the order matters, right? So, if c=0, then (a,b,c) can be (200,100,0), (100,200,0), (200,0,100), (100,0,200), (0,200,100), (0,100,200). But wait, no, because in the case where c=0, a and b take the values 200 and 100, but the positions of a, b, c can vary.

Wait, no, c is set to zero, so the other two variables are a and b. So, for each permutation where one variable is zero, we get two possibilities: (200,100,0), (100,200,0), (200,0,100), (0,200,100), (100,0,200), (0,100,200). Wait, no, that's 6 possibilities, but actually, for each pair (a, b), the third is zero. So, for each of the three variables being zero, how many solutions do we get?

Wait, let me think again. If c=0, then a + b =300, ab=20,000, which gives (200,100,0) and (100,200,0). But in terms of triples, these are different because the positions are different. Similarly, if a=0, then b + c =300, and bc=20,000. So, same as above, you get (0,200,100) and (0,100,200). Similarly, if b=0, you get (200,0,100) and (100,0,200). So, in total, 6 triples where one variable is zero.

Wait, but wait a second: 200 + 100 = 300, so each of these triples is distinct because the non-zero variables are in different positions. So, 6 solutions where exactly one variable is zero.

But wait, hold on: in the case where, say, a=200, b=100, c=0: that's one triple. Similarly, a=100, b=200, c=0: another. Similarly, a=200, c=100, b=0: another, etc. So, 6 such triples.

But wait, is that all? Are there any other triples where more than one variable is zero?

If two variables are zero, say a=0 and b=0, then c=300. Then, S= ab + bc + ca =0, so plugging into the equation: 100*0 - 0 = 0, which is not equal to 2,000,000. So, no solutions there.

Similarly, any triple where two variables are zero will not satisfy the equation, since S=0, abc=0, so 100*0 -0=0≠2,000,000.

So, all the solutions with one variable zero are 6.

But wait, are there solutions where none of the variables are zero?

Hmm, that's a good question. Because we might have triples where all a, b, c are positive integers.

So, let's consider that case. Suppose a, b, c are all positive integers. Then, we have a + b + c =300, and 100(ab + bc + ca) - abc=2,000,000.

Let me write that equation again:

abc = 100(ab + bc + ca) - 2,000,000.

Hmm, perhaps I can factor this or find a way to express this equation.

Wait, let's rearrange:

abc - 100ab - 100bc - 100ca + 2,000,000 = 0.

Hmm, this looks like a cubic equation in three variables. It might be challenging to solve directly, but maybe we can factor it.

Wait, perhaps factor as:

abc - 100ab - 100bc - 100ca + 2,000,000 = 0.

Let me factor out abc:

Wait, no, that's not helpful. Alternatively, perhaps add and subtract 100^3 to complete something.

Wait, another approach: let's factor the equation.

Let me rewrite the equation:

abc - 100ab - 100bc - 100ca = -2,000,000.

Add 100^3 to both sides:

abc - 100ab - 100bc - 100ca + 100^3 = 100^3 - 2,000,000.

Compute 100^3: 1,000,000. So, RHS is 1,000,000 - 2,000,000 = -1,000,000.

So, now, LHS: abc - 100ab - 100bc - 100ca + 100^3.

Hmm, perhaps factor this as (a - 100)(b - 100)(c - 100). Let's check.

Compute (a - 100)(b - 100)(c - 100) = abc -100ab -100ac +100^2a -100bc +100^2b +100^2c -100^3.

Wait, that doesn't seem to match. Let me compute it step by step.

(a - 100)(b - 100) = ab -100a -100b + 100^2.

Multiply by (c - 100):

= ab c -100a c -100b c + 100^2 c -100a b +100^2 a + 100^2 b -100^3.

Wait, so that's:

abc -100ac -100bc +100^2c -100ab +100^2a +100^2b -100^3.

Comparing to our LHS: abc -100ab -100bc -100ca +100^3.

Hmm, not quite the same. Because in the expansion of (a-100)(b-100)(c-100), we have terms like -100ac, -100bc, -100ab, but also additional terms like +100^2 c, +100^2 a, +100^2 b, and -100^3.

So, let's see if we can adjust the equation.

We have:

abc -100ab -100bc -100ca +100^3 = (a - 100)(b - 100)(c - 100) + 100^2(a + b + c) - 3*100^3.

Wait, let's compute:

(a - 100)(b - 100)(c - 100) = abc -100ab -100ac -100bc +100^2 a + 100^2 b + 100^2 c -100^3.

So, abc -100ab -100bc -100ca +100^3 = (a - 100)(b - 100)(c - 100) + 100^3 - [100^2(a + b + c) + 100^3].

Wait, wait, let me do that again.

We have:

abc -100ab -100bc -100ca +100^3 = (a -100)(b -100)(c -100) + [some terms].

Let me subtract (a -100)(b -100)(c -100) from both sides.

So,

abc -100ab -100bc -100ca +100^3 - (a-100)(b-100)(c-100) = 0.

Which is:

[abc -100ab -100bc -100ca +100^3] - [abc -100ab -100ac -100bc +100^2a +100^2b +100^2c -100^3] = 0.

Simplify term by term:

abc - abc = 0.

-100ab +100ab = 0.

-100bc +100bc =0.

-100ca +100ca=0.

100^3 - (-100^3) = 100^3 +100^3= 2*100^3.

And subtracting the remaining terms:

-100^2a -100^2b -100^2c.

So, overall:

2*100^3 -100^2(a + b + c) =0.

Factor 100^2:

100^2(2*100 - (a + b + c)) =0.

Since 100^2 ≠0, this implies 2*100 - (a + b + c)=0.

But a + b + c=300, so 200 -300= -100≠0.

So, this is not zero. Therefore, that approach might not help.

Wait, but in our earlier step, we have:

abc -100ab -100bc -100ca +100^3 = (a -100)(b -100)(c -100) + 100^2(a + b + c) - 3*100^3.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in that expansion. Maybe it's better to consider another substitution.

Alternatively, perhaps set x = a -100, y = b -100, z = c -100. Then, a = x +100, b = y +100, c= z +100.

Then, a + b + c = (x + y + z) + 300 = 300. So, x + y + z =0.

So, x + y + z=0.

Now, let's compute S = ab + bc + ca.

ab = (x +100)(y +100) = xy +100x +100y +10,000.

Similarly, bc = (y +100)(z +100) = yz +100y +100z +10,000.

ca = (z +100)(x +100) = zx +100z +100x +10,000.

So, S = ab + bc + ca = xy + yz + zx + 100x +100y +100y +100z +100z +100x + 3*10,000.

Wait, let's compute each part:

ab + bc + ca:

= [xy +100x +100y +10,000] + [yz +100y +100z +10,000] + [zx +100z +100x +10,000]

= xy + yz + zx + (100x +100y) + (100y +100z) + (100z +100x) + 3*10,000.

Simplify:

= xy + yz + zx + (200x + 200y + 200z) + 30,000.

But since x + y + z =0, 200x + 200y + 200z =200*(x + y + z)=0.

So, S = xy + yz + zx + 30,000.

Similarly, abc is (x +100)(y +100)(z +100). Let's compute that:

= xyz +100(xy + yz + zx) +100^2(x + y + z) +100^3.

But x + y + z=0, so:

= xyz +100(xy + yz + zx) +0 +1,000,000.

So, abc = xyz +100(xy + yz + zx) +1,000,000.

Now, let's substitute S and abc into our equation:

100S - abc = 2,000,000.

Substitute S = xy + yz + zx +30,000 and abc = xyz +100(xy + yz + zx) +1,000,000.

So,

100*(xy + yz + zx +30,000) - [xyz +100(xy + yz + zx) +1,000,000] = 2,000,000.

Compute each term:

100*(xy + yz + zx) + 3,000,000 - xyz -100*(xy + yz + zx) -1,000,000 = 2,000,000.

Simplify:

[100*(xy + yz + zx) -100*(xy + yz + zx)] + (3,000,000 -1,000,000) - xyz = 2,000,000.

So,

0 + 2,000,000 - xyz = 2,000,000.

Which simplifies to:

-xyz = 0 => xyz=0.

Therefore, xyz=0.

So, either x=0, y=0, or z=0.

Since x = a -100, y = b -100, z = c -100.

Therefore, either a=100, or b=100, or c=100.

So, in the case where none of a, b, c are zero, but one of them is 100.

Wait, but let's check this: if, say, a=100, then x=0.

Then, x + y + z =0 => 0 + y + z=0 => y = -z.

So, b = y +100, c=z +100.

But y = -z, so c = -y +100.

So, b = y +100, c= -y +100.

Then, a=100, b = y +100, c= -y +100.

But since a, b, c are nonnegative integers, we have:

y +100 ≥0 => y ≥-100.

Similarly, -y +100 ≥0 => y ≤100.

So, y can range from -100 to 100.

But since b and c have to be nonnegative, y must satisfy:

y +100 ≥0 => y ≥-100.

And c = -y +100 ≥0 => y ≤100.

So, y ∈ {-100, -99, ..., 99, 100}.

But since a, b, c must be nonnegative, let's see for each case.

Wait, but considering that a, b, c are nonnegative, let's see if y is allowed to be negative.

If y is -100, then b = 0, c = 200.

If y is 100, then b=200, c=0.

So, in general, a=100, b= y +100, c= -y +100.

So, for each y from -100 to 100, but ensuring that b and c are nonnegative.

Wait, but let's note that a=100, so b + c = 200, since a + b + c=300.

So, when a=100, b + c=200, and b and c are nonnegative integers.

So, the number of solutions when a=100 is the number of nonnegative integer solutions to b + c=200, which is 201.

Similarly, when b=100, then a + c=200, so 201 solutions.

Same for c=100, a + b=200, so 201 solutions.

But wait, but in our earlier substitution, when a=100, then y can be from -100 to 100, which is 201 values, each corresponding to a distinct solution, right? So, each case (a=100, b=100, c=100) would contribute 201 solutions.

But hold on: when a=100, then the solutions are (100, y+100, -y +100), where y ranges from -100 to 100, inclusive. But when y=-100, then b=0, c=200; when y=100, then b=200, c=0. So, all these solutions are valid, and the number of such triples is 201.

Similarly, when b=100, the number of solutions is 201, and when c=100, 201 solutions.

But wait, but some of these solutions might overlap. For example, the triple (100, 100, 100) would be counted in all three cases. Similarly, other triples where two variables are 100 would be counted twice.

Wait, let me check: when a=100, b=100, then c=100. So this triple is (100,100,100). Similarly, when b=100, a=100, c=100: same triple. So, in the count for a=100, we include (100,100,100); same for b=100 and c=100.

So, how many overlapping triples are there?

Only the triple (100,100,100) is counted three times, once in each case.

Similarly, are there other overlapping triples? For example, if a=100 and b=100, then c=100, which is unique. If a=100 and c=100, then b=100, same thing. So, the only overlapping triple is (100,100,100).

Similarly, suppose a=100, b=100, c=100: counted three times.

So, the total number of solutions in the case where one variable is 100 is:

3*201 - 3*1 +1. Wait, no, let's think.

Wait, each case (a=100, b=100, c=100) has 201 solutions, but the triple (100,100,100) is included in each. So, the total would be 3*(201) - 3*(1) +1, because we subtract the duplicates.

Wait, formula for inclusion-exclusion: |A ∪ B ∪ C| = |A| + |B| + |C| - |A∩B| - |A∩C| - |B∩C| + |A∩B∩C|.

In this case, A is the set of triples where a=100, B where b=100, C where c=100.

So, |A| = |B| = |C| =201.

|A∩B| is the number of triples where a=100 and b=100, which implies c=100.

Similarly, |A∩C|=1, |B∩C|=1.

And |A∩B∩C|=1.

So, |A ∪ B ∪ C|= 201 + 201 +201 -1 -1 -1 +1 = 603 -3 +1=601.

So, 601 solutions where at least one variable is 100.

But wait, earlier we considered the case where one variable is zero, giving 6 solutions.

So, now we have 601 solutions where at least one variable is 100, and 6 solutions where one variable is zero.

Wait, but are these two sets overlapping? Let me see.

If a variable is both zero and 100, that would imply 0=100, which is impossible. So, these sets are disjoint. So, total solutions would be 601 + 6 = 607.

But wait, but wait a second. When we set a=100, we included cases where b or c could be zero. For example, a=100, b=0, c=200. Similarly, a=100, b=200, c=0. These are part of the 201 solutions in each case where a=100.

Similarly, in the case where, say, a=0, we have b=200, c=100, which is part of the 6 solutions with a zero, but not part of the 601 solutions where a variable is 100.

So, yes, the two sets are disjoint.

Wait, but in the case where a=100, if b=0, then c=200, which is allowed because 100+0+200=300. Similarly, when a=0, b=200, c=100. So, in the 6 solutions where one variable is zero, the other two are 200 and 100, but in a different order.

So, in the 601 solutions, the cases where another variable is zero (e.g., a=100, b=0, c=200) are included in the 201 solutions for a=100.

Wait, in the case where a=100, the 201 solutions include all triples where a=100, regardless of whether b or c is zero. So, when a=100, and b=0, c=200, that's part of the 201.

Similarly, when a=0, but in that case, a isn't 100, so that's part of the 6 solutions.

So, the 601 solutions include the cases where another variable is zero (as long as a=100). The 6 solutions are when one variable is zero, and another is 200, but in that case, the other variable is 100. So, the 6 solutions are when one variable is zero, and the other two are 200 and 100. But in the 601, when a=100, b=0 is allowed, which is part of the 201.

So, in the 601, a=100, b=0, c=200 is included, but when a=0, the case a=0, b=200, c=100 is in the 6 solutions. So, these are separate.

Therefore, the total number of solutions is 601 + 6 = 607.

Wait, but hold on. Let me check if any of the 601 solutions include triples where two variables are zero.

Earlier, we saw that if two variables are zero, the equation isn't satisfied. So, in the 601 solutions where at least one variable is 100, there can't be two variables zero because that would require the third to be 300, but then S=0, abc=0, which doesn't satisfy the equation.

So, the 601 solutions are all valid, and the 6 solutions are also valid, and they don't overlap.

So, total solutions: 601 +6=607.

Wait, but earlier when I considered the case where a=100, I found 201 solutions. Similarly for b=100 and c=100, but with overlaps. So, according to inclusion-exclusion, the number is 601.

Plus, the 6 solutions where one variable is zero, and the other two sum to 300 and satisfy the equation.

Wait, but wait a second. Let me check if all these 601 solutions satisfy the original equation.

Because we derived that in the case where a=100, all solutions satisfy the equation, but let me double-check with an example.

Take a=100, b=0, c=200: check if it satisfies the original equation.

Compute a + b + c = 100 + 0 + 200=300: correct.

Compute a²b +a²c +b²a +b²c +c²a +c²b.

Compute each term:

a²b=100²*0=0.

a²c=100²*200=10,000*200=2,000,000.

b²a=0²*100=0.

b²c=0²*200=0.

c²a=200²*100=40,000*100=4,000,000.

c²b=200²*0=0.

Sum all terms: 0 + 2,000,000 + 0 + 0 +4,000,000 +0=6,000,000. So yes, it satisfies.

Similarly, take a=100, b=100, c=100: a + b + c=300.

Compute the expression:

a²b=100²*100=1,000,000.

Similarly, a²c=1,000,000.

b²a=1,000,000.

b²c=1,000,000.

c²a=1,000,000.

c²b=1,000,000.

Sum them up: 6*1,000,000=6,000,000. So, correct.

Another example: a=100, b=50, c=150.

Check if this satisfies the equation.

Compute a²b + a²c + b²a + b²c + c²a + c²b.

a²b=100²*50=10,000*50=500,000.

a²c=100²*150=10,000*150=1,500,000.

b²a=50²*100=2,500*100=250,000.

b²c=50²*150=2,500*150=375,000.

c²a=150²*100=22,500*100=2,250,000.

c²b=150²*50=22,500*50=1,125,000.

Sum all terms:

500,000 +1,500,000=2,000,000.

250,000 +375,000=625,000.

2,250,000 +1,125,000=3,375,000.

Now sum all three: 2,000,000 +625,000=2,625,000; 2,625,000 +3,375,000=6,000,000.

So, yes, it works.

Therefore, all the 601 solutions where one variable is 100, and the 6 solutions where one variable is zero, satisfy both equations.

So, the total number of triples is 601 +6=607.

Wait, but wait. Earlier, I thought that when a=100, there are 201 solutions, but when considering that a=100, and the other variables can be any nonnegative integers such that b + c=200, which gives 201 solutions. Similarly, for b=100 and c=100. But inclusion-exclusion showed that the total is 601.

But let's confirm this reasoning again.

Each case (a=100, b=100, c=100) individually has 201 solutions.

But when a=100 and b=100, c=100 is the only solution. So, the intersection of a=100 and b=100 is just that one triple.

Similarly, the intersection of a=100 and c=100 is one triple, and same for b=100 and c=100.

So, using inclusion-exclusion:

Total = |A| + |B| + |C| - |A∩B| - |A∩C| - |B∩C| + |A∩B∩C|.

Which is 201 +201 +201 -1 -1 -1 +1= 603 -3 +1=601.

Yes, that's correct.

So, the 601 solutions include all the cases where a=100, b=100, or c=100, without double-counting the overlaps.

Thus, the total number of triples is 601 +6=607.

Wait, but in the initial case where one variable is zero, we have 6 solutions. Are these all distinct from the 601?

Yes, because in the 601, the variables being 100 can't be zero. So, the 6 solutions are separate.

Therefore, the total number of solutions is 607.

Wait, but let me compute 601 +6=607.

Wait, but wait, what about when two variables are 100? For example, a=100, b=100, c=100. That's included in all three cases, but in inclusion-exclusion, we subtracted the overlaps.

So, I think the count is correct.

Therefore, the total number of triples is 607.

Wait, but wait a second. Let me think again.

Earlier, when I considered the case where a=100, I found 201 solutions, including cases where b=0 or c=0. Similarly, when a=0, we have 2 solutions where a=0, and b and c are 200 and 100.

But when a=100 and b=0, that's part of the 201 solutions in the a=100 case.

Similarly, when a=0, b=200, c=100, that's part of the 6 solutions where a=0.

So, in the 601 solutions, we have all triples where a=100, or b=100, or c=100, regardless of whether other variables are zero or not.

In the 6 solutions, we have the cases where exactly one variable is zero, which are in addition to the 601 solutions.

So, the total is 601 +6=607.

Therefore, the answer is 607.

Wait, but wait a moment. Let me check if all the 607 solutions are nonnegative integers. Because in the substitution, we considered x, y, z as integers, but does that translate to a, b, c being nonnegative?

Yes, because x = a -100, so a = x +100. For a to be nonnegative, x must be ≥-100.

Similarly, since x + y + z=0, and a, b, c are nonnegative, the substitution ensures that all variables are nonnegative.

So, yes, all 607 solutions are valid.

Therefore, the final answer is 607.


To solve the problem, we analyze the given equations and systematically count the valid triples.

1. **Equation 1**: \(a + b + c = 300\).  
2. **Equation 2**: \(a^2b + a^2c + b^2a + b^2c + c^2a + c^2b = 6,000,000\).

We rewrite the second equation using symmetry and substitution:
\[
a^2(b + c) + b^2(a + c) + c^2(a + b) = 6,000,000.
\]
Substituting \(b + c = 300 - a\), \(a + c = 300 - b\), and \(a + b = 300 - c\), we get:
\[
300(a^2 + b^2 + c^2) - (a^3 + b^3 + c^3) = 6,000,000.
\]
Using the identities for sums of squares and cubes, we simplify to:
\[
100(ab + bc + ca) - abc = 2,000,000.
\]
This equation is solved by considering two cases:

- **Case 1**: One variable is zero. This leads to 6 valid triples.
- **Case 2**: One variable is 100. Using inclusion-exclusion, we find 601 valid triples.

Summing both cases, we find the total number of triples is \(601 + 6 = 607\).

The final answer is:
\[
\boxed{607}
\]
