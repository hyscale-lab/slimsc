Okay, so I need to solve this probability problem about Jen entering a lottery. Let me try to understand what's going on here.

Jen picks 4 distinct numbers from the set S = {1,2,3,...,9,10}. Then, 4 numbers are randomly chosen from S as well. She wins a prize if at least two of her numbers match the randomly chosen ones. She wins the grand prize if all four of her numbers match.

The question is asking for the probability that she wins the grand prize given that she won a prize. They mention this probability is m/n where m and n are coprime, and we need to find m + n.

Hmm. So, this is a conditional probability problem. To find the probability of the grand prize given that she won a prize, I think I should use the formula:

P(Grand Prize | Prize) = P(Grand Prize and Prize) / P(Prize)

But wait, actually, the grand prize is a subset of winning a prize. Because if she wins the grand prize, she definitely won a prize. So, P(Grand Prize and Prize) is just P(Grand Prize). Therefore, the formula simplifies to:

P(Grand Prize | Prize) = P(Grand Prize) / P(Prize)

So, I need to find two probabilities: the probability that she wins the grand prize and the probability that she wins any prize (at least two matches).

Let me start by calculating the total number of possible ways to choose 4 numbers from 10. That's the combination of 10 choose 4, which is denoted as C(10,4).

C(10,4) = 10! / (4! * (10-4)!) = (10*9*8*7)/(4*3*2*1) = 210.

So, there are 210 possible sets of 4 numbers that could be chosen.

First, let's compute P(Grand Prize). That's the probability that all four of her numbers are chosen. Since there's only one specific set of four numbers that she has, the number of favorable outcomes is 1. So,

P(Grand Prize) = 1 / C(10,4) = 1/210.

Next, I need to compute P(Prize), which is the probability that at least two of her numbers are chosen. Hmm, "at least two" means two, three, or four matches. Calculating this directly might be a bit tedious, so maybe it's easier to compute the complement probability and subtract it from 1.

But wait, the complement of "at least two" is "fewer than two," which means zero or one match. So,

P(Prize) = 1 - P(0 matches) - P(1 match)

So, I can compute P(0 matches) and P(1 match) and then subtract their sum from 1 to get P(at least two matches).

Let me compute P(0 matches) first. That's the probability that none of Jen's four numbers are chosen. So, all four chosen numbers are from the remaining 6 numbers (since S has 10 numbers, and Jen picked 4, leaving 6).

So, the number of ways to choose 4 numbers from the 6 that are not Jen's is C(6,4).

C(6,4) = 15.

Therefore, P(0 matches) = C(6,4) / C(10,4) = 15 / 210 = 1/14.

Now, P(1 match). This is the probability that exactly one of Jen's numbers is chosen, and the other three are from the remaining 6 numbers.

To compute this, we can think of it as choosing 1 number from Jen's 4 and 3 numbers from the other 6. So, the number of favorable outcomes is C(4,1) * C(6,3).

C(4,1) is 4, and C(6,3) is 20. So, 4*20 = 80.

Therefore, P(1 match) = 80 / 210. Let me simplify that: divide numerator and denominator by 10, 8/21.

So, P(1 match) = 8/21.

Wait, let me confirm that. C(4,1)=4, C(6,3
