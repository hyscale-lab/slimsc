Okay, so I have this problem about finding the number of rectangles that can be formed inside a regular dodecagon. Each side of the rectangle has to lie on either a side or a diagonal of the dodecagon. Hmm, that sounds a bit tricky, but let me try to break it down.

First, I should probably visualize a regular dodecagon. It's a 12-sided polygon with all sides equal and all internal angles equal. Each internal angle can be calculated, but maybe I don't need that right now. Since it's regular, it's symmetric, which might help later.

The problem mentions that the sides of the rectangles lie on either sides or diagonals of the dodecagon. So, the sides of the rectangle can be sides of the dodecagon or its diagonals. That means when constructing a rectangle, I need to choose four points (vertices) of the dodecagon such that the sides between them are either sides or diagonals, and the figure formed is a rectangle.

Wait, but rectangles require specific conditions. The opposite sides must be equal and parallel, and the angles must be 90 degrees. So, in the context of the dodecagon, the sides of the rectangle must be either sides or diagonals that are parallel and equal in length.

Since the dodecagon is regular, all sides are equal, and the diagonals can have different lengths depending on how many vertices they skip. For example, a diagonal can connect two vertices with one vertex in between, two vertices, etc. So, the possible diagonals can be of different lengths, which might correspond to different possible side lengths for the rectangles.

So, maybe the key is to consider all possible pairs of parallel sides/diagonals and see how they can form rectangles.

Wait, but in a regular polygon, sides are only parallel if the number of sides they skip is the same. For example, in a regular hexagon, each side is parallel to the one three apart. Similarly, in a dodecagon, sides are parallel if they are separated by a certain number of steps. So, perhaps I need to figure out all possible pairs of parallel chords (sides or diagonals) in the dodecagon.

Each rectangle is defined by two pairs of such parallel chords. So, to form a rectangle, I need two pairs of parallel chords that are perpendicular to each other.

Wait, but in a regular dodecagon, the angles between sides
