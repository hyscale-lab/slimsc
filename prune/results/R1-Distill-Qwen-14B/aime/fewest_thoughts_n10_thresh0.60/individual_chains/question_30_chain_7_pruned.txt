Okay, so I've got this math problem to solve. It says: Let ω ≠ 1 be a 13th root of unity. Find the remainder when the product from k=0 to 12 of (2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k}) is divided by 1000. Hmm, that's a mouthful. Let me try to break it down.

First, I remember that roots of unity are complex numbers that satisfy ω^n = 1 for some integer n. In this case, n is 13, so ω is a primitive 13th root of unity because ω ≠ 1. That means ω^13 = 1, and ω^k ≠ 1 for any k from 1 to 12.

The problem is asking for the product of terms of the form (2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k}) for k from 0 to 12, and then find the remainder when that product is divided by 1000. So essentially, I need to compute:

P = product from k=0 to 12 of (2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k})

And then find P mod 1000.

Hmm, okay. Let me think about how to approach this. I remember that when dealing with products over roots of unity, sometimes it's useful to consider polynomials whose roots are these ω^k. Since ω is a 13th root of unity, the minimal polynomial for ω is the 13th cyclotomic polynomial, which is Φ_13(x) = x^12 + x^11 + ... + x + 1. Because Φ_n(x) is the product of (x - ω^k) for k from 1 to n-1 when n is prime, which 13 is.

Wait, but in this case, we're dealing with the product over k=0 to 12 of (2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k}). So k=0 is a special case because ω^0 = 1. Let me calculate that term first.

When k=0: ω^0 = 1. So the term becomes 2 - 2*1 + 1^2 = 2 - 2 + 1 = 1. So that term is 1. So the entire product is 1 multiplied by the product from k=1 to 12 of (2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k}).

So P = 1 * product_{k=1}^{12} (2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k})

So now I need to compute that product from k=1 to 12. Since ω is a primitive 13th root, ω^k for k from 1 to 12 are all the nontrivial 13th roots of unity.

I need a way to express the product in terms of polynomials. Maybe I can think of each term as a value of a polynomial evaluated at ω^k. Let me see:

Each term is (2 - 2ω^
