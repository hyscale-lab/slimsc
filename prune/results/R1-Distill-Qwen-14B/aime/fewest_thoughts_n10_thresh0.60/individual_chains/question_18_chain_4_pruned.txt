Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the number of rectangles that can be formed inside a regular dodecagon. Each side of the rectangle has to lie on either a side or a diagonal of the dodecagon. Hmm, a regular dodecagon has 12 sides, so it's a 12-sided polygon with all sides equal and all internal angles equal. The problem mentions that the sides of the rectangles lie on the sides or diagonals, so I need to figure out how these rectangles can be formed.

First, I should probably visualize a regular dodecagon. I know that in a regular polygon, the number of sides equals the number of vertices, so a dodecagon has 12 vertices. Each vertex is equally spaced around a circle. So, the central angle between any two adjacent vertices is 360/12 = 30 degrees.

Now, rectangles in a regular polygon typically have their sides aligned with the polygon's sides or diagonals. So, each rectangle must have its sides parallel to some pair of sides or diagonals of the dodecagon. Since a rectangle has opposite sides equal and all angles 90 degrees, the sides must be aligned in such a way that the angles between them are right angles. But wait, in a regular dodecagon, the sides and diagonals have angles that are multiples of 30 degrees. So, how can two lines at 30-degree increments form a right angle (90 degrees)?

Let me think. A right angle is 90 degrees. Since each step around the dodecagon is 30 degrees, the number of steps between two vertices that are perpendicular would be 90/30 = 3 steps. So, in terms of the dodecagon, two sides or diagonals are perpendicular if they are three edges apart. For example, if I pick a vertex, the vertex three steps away from it is the one that's 90 degrees around the circle. So, the chord connecting these two vertices would be a diagonal that is perpendicular to another such chord.

Wait, so for a rectangle, we need two pairs of sides that are perpendicular. That is, each side of the rectangle must lie along a chord that is three steps apart from another chord. So, perhaps the sides of the rectangle are formed by selecting two pairs of vertices that are three steps apart, and each pair is separated by a certain number of steps around
