Okay, so Alice and Bob are playing this game with a stack of n tokens. They take turns removing either 1 or 4 tokens from the stack. Alice goes first. The person who takes the last token wins. I need to figure out how many positive integers n â‰¤ 2024 allow Bob to have a winning strategy, no matter how Alice plays.

Hmm, this sounds like a classic combinatorial game theory problem. I remember that in such games, positions are often classified as either winning or losing positions. A winning position means the current player can force a win, and a losing position means no matter what the current player does, the opponent can force a win.

So, let me try to model this. Let's define a position as losing if the player whose turn it is cannot force a win, assuming the opponent plays optimally. Conversely, a winning position is one where the player can force a win.

The base case would be when there are 0 tokens left. In that case, the game is over, and the player who just moved is the winner. But wait, in our problem, the player who takes the last token wins. So, if it's your turn and there are 0 tokens left, you can't make a move, so you lose. Therefore, n=0 is a losing position.

Let's build up from there.

For n=1: The current player can take 1 token and win. So, n=1 is a winning position.

n=2: The current player can take 1 token, leaving 1 for the opponent who then takes it and wins. Wait, no, that's not right. If I take 1 token, leaving 1, opponent takes 1 and wins. Or I can take 4 tokens, but I can't because there are only 2. So I have to take 1, leaving 1 for the opponent who takes it and wins. So n=2 is a losing position? Wait, no, because the current player can take 1 and leave the opponent in a position where they can win. Wait, maybe I need to think in terms of Grundy numbers or something.

Wait, perhaps it's better to use dynamic programming. Let's create an array where each index represents the number of tokens, and the value is True if it's a winning position, False otherwise.

We can start from n=0 and go up to n=2024, determining for each n
