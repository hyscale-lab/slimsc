Okay, so I've got this problem here where I need to find the remainder when the product from k=0 to 12 of (2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k}) is divided by 1000, where ω is a 13th root of unity and ω isn't equal to 1. Hmm, that's a mouthful, but let me break it down.

First, let me recall that a 13th root of unity satisfies ω^13 = 1. So ω^k for k from 0 to 12 are all the distinct roots. Since ω isn't 1, we're excluding that particular root.

The expression we're looking at is the product of (2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k}) for k from 0 to 12. I need to compute this product modulo 1000.

I wonder if there's a way to simplify this product. Maybe using properties of roots of unity or some polynomial identities. Let me think about polynomials. Since ω is a root of x^13 - 1 = 0, perhaps I can relate this product to evaluating some polynomial at certain points.

Wait, the product is over all 13th roots of unity, except ω^0 = 1. So each term in the product is a function evaluated at ω^k. Let me denote f(x) = 2 - 2x + x^2. Then the product becomes the product of f(ω^k) for k = 0 to 12. But since ω^0 = 1, when k=0, f(1) = 2 - 2(1) + (1)^2 = 2 - 2 + 1 = 1. So the product is 1 multiplied by the product of f(ω^k) for k=1 to 12.

So, the product is equal to the product of f(ω^k) for k=1 to 12. Now, I remember that for a polynomial P(x), the product over all roots of unity of P(ω^k) is related to the resultant or something like that. Alternatively, perhaps using the fact that the product over k of (x - ω^k) is x^13 - 1. But here, instead of x - ω^k, we have something else.

Wait, f(x) = x^2 - 2x + 2. Let me check: 2 - 2x + x^2 is the same as x^2 - 2x + 2, yes. So f(x) = x^2 - 2x + 2.

So the product we're looking at is product_{k=1}^{12} f(ω^k). Hmm. Since ω is a primitive 13th root of unity, the minimal polynomial for ω is the 13th cyclotomic polynomial, which is Φ_13(x) = x^12 + x^11 + ... + x + 1. But I'm not sure if that helps directly.

Wait, perhaps I can think about the product over k=1 to 12 of f(ω^k) as the product over all roots of Φ_13(x) of f(ω). Let me consider that. Since Φ_13(x) is the minimal polynomial, and its roots are exactly the primitive 13th roots of unity.

Alternatively, maybe I can relate the product to evaluating f(ω^k) for all k from 1 to 12. But I'm not sure.

Another approach is to think about the product of f(ω^k) as the product of (ω^{2k} - 2ω^k + 2). Wait, so for each k, we're plugging ω^k into f(x). So the product becomes f(ω) * f(ω^2) * ... * f(ω^{12}).

If I can find a polynomial whose roots are ω^k for k=1 to 12, which is Φ_13(x) = x^12 + x^11 + ... + x + 1, then perhaps I can relate the product to evaluating f(x) at each root and multiplying.

Wait, I think there's a theorem that says that the product of (a - ω^k) for k=1 to 12 is equal to Φ_13(a). Let me check. Yes, for a primitive root ω, the product over k=1 to n-1 of (a - ω^k) is equal to Φ_n(a), the nth cyclotomic polynomial evaluated at a. So in this case, n =13, so Φ_13(a) = product_{k=1}^{12} (a - ω^k). So this product is Φ_13(a) = a^12 + a^11 + ... + a + 1.

But in our case, the product is product_{k=1}^{12} f(ω^k). So f(ω^k) = (ω^{2k} - 2ω^k + 2). Let me write that as (ω^k)^2 - 2ω^k + 2 = f(ω^k).

Wait, maybe I can write this as f(x) = x^2 - 2x + 2. So the product is product_{x=ω} (x^2 - 2x + 2). Let me denote P(x) = x^2 - 2x + 2. Then the product is product_{x=ω^k, k=1}^{12} P(x).

But how can I compute this product? Perhaps by considering that it's the resultant of P(x) and Φ_13(x). Alternatively, I can consider that the product over all roots x of Φ_13(x) of P(x) is equal to the resultant of P(x) and Φ_13(x), but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps I can express P(x) as a polynomial and then evaluate its product over all roots x of Φ_13(x). Since Φ_13(x) is irreducible over the rationals, I can consider that the product would be the resultant or something else.

Wait, another approach: Let me consider the product as product_{k=1}^{12} (ω^{2k} - 2ω^k + 2). Let me make a substitution: let y = ω^k, so that y^13 = 1. Then each term becomes y^2 - 2y + 2.

So the product becomes product_{y^13=1, y≠1} (y^2 - 2y + 2). So the product is equal to product_{y} (y^2 - 2y + 2), where y runs through all 13th roots of unity except 1.

But wait, that can be written as product_{y^13=1} (y^2 - 2y + 2) / (1^2 - 2*1 + 2) = product_{y^13=1} (y^2 - 2y + 2) / (1 -2 + 2) = product_{y^13=1} (y^2 - 2y + 2) / 1 = product_{y^13=1} (y^2 - 2y + 2).

So, actually, I can compute the product over all y^13=1 of (y^2 - 2y + 2). That would include y=1, which we can then divide out.

But how do I compute the product over all y^13=1 of (y^2 - 2y + 2)? Let me think. There's a formula for the product over all roots of unity of a polynomial evaluated at those roots. Specifically, if you have a polynomial f(x), then the product over all roots of unity y of f(y) is equal to the resultant of f(x) and x^n -1, which can be computed as the product of f(y) for each y being a root of x^n -1.

Alternatively, perhaps I can relate this product to evaluating another polynomial. Let me recall that for a polynomial Q(x) = product_{y^13=1} (x - y) = x^13 -1. Then product_{y^13=1} (a - y) = a^13 -1.

But in our case, we have product_{y^13=1} (y^2 - 2y + 2). Let me set z = y. Then it's product_{z^13=1} (z^2 - 2z + 2). So, if I consider the polynomial f(z) = z^2 - 2z + 2, then product_{z^13=1} f(z) is equal to the product over all 13th roots z of f(z).

I think there's a formula for this. The product over all roots z of a polynomial Q(z) of f(z) is equal to the resultant of Q and f, but I might be mixing things up.

Alternatively, perhaps I can note that product_{z^13=1} f(z) is equal to the resultant of f(z) and z^13 -1. The resultant can be computed as the product of f(z) for each root z of z^13 -1, which is exactly the product we're looking for.

But I'm not exactly sure how to compute that resultant. Maybe an easier way is to consider that product_{z^13=1} (z^2 - 2z + 2) is equal to the product of f(z) over all 13th roots z.

Alternatively, perhaps think of f(z) as a quadratic in z. So if I let f(z) = (z - a)(z - b), where a and b are roots of f(z)=0. Then, product_{z^13=1} f(z) = product_{z^13=1} (z - a)(z - b) = product_{z^13=1} (z - a) * product_{z^13=1} (z - b).

But product_{z^13=1} (z - a) = a^13 -1, because for each a, product_{z^13=1} (z - a) = z^13 - a^13 evaluated at z=1? Wait, no, that's not quite right.

Wait, actually, the product over all z^13=1 of (z - a) is equal to (a^13 -1). Because the product over all roots z of x^13 -1 of (z - a) is equal to (a^13 -1). That's because the polynomial x^13 -1 can be factored as product_{z}(x - z), so evaluating at x=a gives product_{z}(a - z) = a^13 -1. So yes, product_{z^13=1} (z - a) = a^13 -1.

Wait, but in our case, we have product_{z^13=1} (z^2 - 2z + 2). Let me write this as product_{z^13=1} (z^2 - 2z + 2) = product_{z^13=1} (z - a)(z - b), where a and b are the roots of z^2 - 2z + 2 = 0.

So the roots a and b satisfy a + b = 2 and ab = 2. Then, the product becomes [product_{z^13=1} (z - a)] * [product_{z^13=1} (z - b)] = (a^13 -1)(b^13 -1).

So, product_{z^13=1} (z^2 - 2z + 2) = (a^13 -1)(b^13 -1).

But a and b are roots of z^2 - 2z + 2 = 0, so a = [2 + sqrt(4 - 8)]/2 = [2 + sqrt(-4)]/2 = 1 + i. Similarly, b = 1 - i.

So, substituting, we get:

(a^13 -1)(b^13 -1) = [(1 + i)^13 -1][(1 - i)^13 -1].

So now, I need to compute (1 + i)^13 and (1 - i)^13.

Let me compute (1 + i)^n first. I know that 1 + i has a magnitude of sqrt(2) and an angle of 45 degrees or π/4 radians. So, (1 + i)^n = (sqrt(2))^n * e^{i n π/4}.

Similarly, (1 - i) is the conjugate, so (1 - i)^n = (sqrt(2))^n * e^{-i n π/4}.

So, for n=13:

(1 + i)^13 = (sqrt(2))^13 * e^{i 13 π/4}.

Similarly, (1 - i)^13 = (sqrt(2))^13 * e^{-i 13 π/4}.

But 13 π/4 is equal to 3π + π/4, which is the same as π/4 in the third revolution because 3π is π + 2π, but angles are periodic mod 2π.

Wait, 13 π/4 divided by 2π is 13/8, which is 1 and 5/8. So, subtract 2π (which is 8π/4) from 13π/4 to get 5π/4. So, e^{i 13π/4} = e^{i 5π/4}, and e^{-i 13π/4} = e^{-i 5π/4}.

So, (1 + i)^13 = (sqrt(2))^13 * e^{i 5π/4} = (sqrt(2))^13 * [cos(5π/4) + i sin(5π/4)] = (sqrt(2))^13 * (-sqrt(2)/2 - i sqrt(2)/2).

Similarly, (1 - i)^13 = (sqrt(2))^13 * e^{-i 5π/4} = (sqrt(2))^13 * [cos(5π/4) - i sin(5π/4)] = (sqrt(2))^13 * (-sqrt(2)/2 + i sqrt(2)/2).

So, let's compute (1 + i)^13: 

First, (sqrt(2))^13 = (2)^{6.5} = 2^6 * sqrt(2) = 64 * sqrt(2).

Then, multiply by (-sqrt(2)/2 - i sqrt(2)/2):

So, 64 * sqrt(2) * (-sqrt(2)/2 - i sqrt(2)/2) = 64 * [ (-2)/2 - i (2)/2 ] = 64 * (-1 - i) = -64 - 64i.

Similarly, (1 - i)^13 = 64 * sqrt(2) * (-sqrt(2)/2 + i sqrt(2)/2) = 64 * [ (-2)/2 + i (2)/2 ] = 64 * (-1 + i) = -64 + 64i.

So, now, let's compute (a^13 -1) and (b^13 -1):

a = 1 + i, so a^13 = -64 -64i, so a^13 -1 = (-64 -1) + (-64i) = -65 -64i.

Similarly, b = 1 - i, so b^13 = -64 + 64i, so b^13 -1 = (-64 -1) + 64i = -65 +64i.

So, the product (a^13 -1)(b^13 -1) = (-65 -64i)(-65 +64i).

This is a product of a complex number and its conjugate, which is equal to the square of the modulus.

So, modulus squared is (-65)^2 + (64)^2 = 4225 + 4096 = 8321.

Wait, let's compute it step by step:

(-65 -64i)(-65 +64i) = (-65)^2 - (64i)^2 = 4225 - (4096)(i^2) = 4225 - (4096)(-1) = 4225 + 4096 = 8321.

So, (a^13 -1)(b^13 -1) = 8321.

Wait, but earlier, we had product_{z^13=1} (z^2 -2z +2) = (a^13 -1)(b^13 -1) = 8321.

But wait, no. Wait, the product was over all z^13=1 of (z^2 -2z +2) = product_{z} (z^2 -2z +2) = 8321.

But in our original problem, we have product_{k=0}^{12} (2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k}) = product_{k=0}^{12} f(ω^k), where f(x) = x^2 - 2x +2.

But when k=0, ω^0 =1, so f(1) = 1^2 - 2*1 +2 = 1 -2 +2 =1.

So the entire product is 1 * product_{k=1}^{12} f(ω^k) = product_{k=1}^{12} f(ω^k).

But earlier, we found that product_{z^13=1} f(z) = 8321, which includes z=1, which gives f(1)=1. So, product_{k=0}^{12} f(ω^k) = product_{z} f(z) = 8321.

Wait, but the problem asks for product from k=0 to 12, which includes k=0, so that's exactly product_{z} f(z) =8321.

Wait, but earlier I thought that the product from k=1 to12 is equal to product_{z} f(z), but no, actually, the product from k=0 to12 is product_{z} f(z), which is 8321. So according to that, the answer is 8321 mod 1000.

But wait, 8321 divided by 1000 is 8*1000=8000, so 8321-8000=321. So the remainder is 321.

Wait, but I think I made a mistake. Because the product from k=0 to12 of f(ω^k) is equal to product_{z} f(z) where z are the 13th roots of unity, which is 8321. So the product is 8321. So 8321 mod 1000 is 321.

But wait, earlier I thought that product_{z} f(z) = (a^13 -1)(b^13 -1) =8321, but I need to confirm this.

Wait, going back: product_{z^13=1} (z^2 -2z +2) = product_{z} (z - a)(z - b) = product_{z} (z - a) * product_{z} (z - b) = (a^13 -1)(b^13 -1).

But a =1 +i, so a^13 = (1 +i)^13 = -64 -64i, as computed earlier. So a^13 -1 = (-64 -64i) -1 = -65 -64i. Similarly, b^13 -1 = -65 +64i.

So (a^13 -1)(b^13 -1) = (-65 -64i)(-65 +64i) = (-65)^2 - (64i)^2 = 4225 - (4096)(-1) = 4225 +4096=8321.

So yes, product_{z} f(z) =8321.

So, the product we're looking for is 8321, so 8321 mod 1000 is 321.

Wait, but hold on. The original problem was product_{k=0}^{12} (2 -2ω^k + ω^{2k}). Which is equal to product_{k=0}^{12} (ω^{2k} - 2ω^k +2). Which is the same as product_{k=0}^{12} (ω^{k})^2 - 2ω^k +2 = product_{k=0}^{12} f(ω^k) where f(x) =x^2 -2x +2.

But we've shown that product_{z} f(z) =8321, where z runs through all 13th roots of unity, including z=1. So the product is indeed 8321.

So, 8321 divided by 1000 leaves a remainder of 321.

Wait, but let me double-check. Maybe I miscalculated (1 +i)^13.

Let me compute (1 +i)^1: 1 +i.

(1 +i)^2: (1 +i)(1 +i)=1 +2i +i^2=1 +2i -1=2i.

(1 +i)^3: (1 +i)^2*(1 +i)=2i*(1 +i)=2i +2i^2=2i -2= -2 +2i.

(1 +i)^4: (1 +i)^2 squared is (2i)^2= -4.

(1 +i)^5: (1 +i)^4*(1 +i)=(-4)(1 +i)= -4 -4i.

(1 +i)^6: (1 +i)^5*(1 +i)= (-4 -4i)(1 +i)= -4(1 +i) -4i(1 +i)= -4 -4i -4i -4i^2 = -4 -8i +4= 0 -8i.

(1 +i)^7: (1 +i)^6*(1 +i)= (-8i)(1 +i)= -8i -8i^2= -8i +8=8 -8i.

(1 +i)^8: (1 +i)^4 squared is (-4)^2=16.

(1 +i)^9: (1 +i)^8*(1 +i)=16*(1 +i)=16 +16i.

(1 +i)^10: (1 +i)^9*(1 +i)= (16 +16i)(1 +i)=16(1 +i) +16i(1 +i)=16 +16i +16i +16i^2=16 +32i -16=32i.

(1 +i)^11: (1 +i)^10*(1 +i)=32i*(1 +i)=32i +32i^2=32i -32= -32 +32i.

(1 +i)^12: (1 +i)^11*(1 +i)= (-32 +32i)(1 +i)= -32(1 +i) +32i(1 +i)= -32 -32i +32i +32i^2= -32 +0i -32= -64.

(1 +i)^13: (1 +i)^12*(1 +i)= (-64)(1 +i)= -64 -64i.

Yes, that's correct. So (1 +i)^13 = -64 -64i. Similarly, (1 -i)^13 = -64 +64i.

So, as before, the product (a^13 -1)(b^13 -1) = (-65 -64i)(-65 +64i) =8321.

So, the product is 8321, mod 1000 is 321.

Wait, but let me think again. Is the product from k=0 to12 of (2 -2ω^k + ω^{2k}) equal to product_{z} (z^2 -2z +2), where z = ω^k.

Yes, because ω^k are all the 13th roots of unity, including 1. So the product is indeed 8321, as we computed.

Therefore, the remainder when divided by 1000 is 321.

But wait, just to be thorough, let me double-check the modulus calculation.

8321 divided by 1000 is 8*1000=8000, 8321-8000=321.

So yes, 8321 mod 1000 is 321.

Therefore, the answer is 321.


To solve the problem, we need to find the remainder when the product 
\[ \prod_{k=0}^{12}(2 - 2\omega^k + \omega^{2k}) \]
is divided by 1000, where \(\omega \neq 1\) is a 13th root of unity.

First, we recognize that \(\omega\) satisfies \(\omega^{13} = 1\), and the terms \(\omega^k\) for \(k = 0, 1, \ldots, 12\) are all the 13th roots of unity. The given product can be rewritten as:
\[ \prod_{k=0}^{12} (2 - 2\omega^k + \omega^{2k}) = \prod_{k=0}^{12} (\omega^{2k} - 2\omega^k + 2). \]

Let \(f(x) = x^2 - 2x + 2\). Then, the product becomes:
\[ \prod_{k=0}^{12} f(\omega^k). \]

Since \(\omega^k\) runs through all 13th roots of unity, including \(\omega^0 = 1\), the product is equivalent to:
\[ \prod_{z^{13}=1} f(z), \]
where \(z\) are all 13th roots of unity.

The product \(\prod_{z^{13}=1} f(z)\) can be computed by considering the roots of \(f(z) = z^2 - 2z + 2\), which are \(a = 1 + i\) and \(b = 1 - i\). Using the property of polynomials, we have:
\[ \prod_{z^{13}=1} f(z) = \prod_{z^{13}=1} (z - a)(z - b) = \prod_{z^{13}=1} (z - a) \cdot \prod_{z^{13}=1} (z - b). \]

Each of these products can be evaluated using the fact that the product of \((z - a)\) over all 13th roots \(z\) is \(a^{13} - 1\). Thus:
\[ \prod_{z^{13}=1} (z - a) = a^{13} - 1 \quad \text{and} \quad \prod_{z^{13}=1} (z - b) = b^{13} - 1. \]

Substituting \(a = 1 + i\) and \(b = 1 - i\), we compute:
\[ a^{13} = (1 + i)^{13} = -64 - 64i \quad \text{and} \quad b^{13} = (1 - i)^{13} = -64 + 64i. \]

Thus:
\[ a^{13} - 1 = -65 - 64i \quad \text{and} \quad b^{13} - 1 = -65 + 64i. \]

The product is:
\[ (-65 - 64i)(-65 + 64i) = (-65)^2 - (64i)^2 = 4225 + 4096 = 8321. \]

Finally, we find the remainder when 8321 is divided by 1000:
\[ 8321 \mod 1000 = 321. \]

Therefore, the remainder is:
\[
\boxed{321}
\]
