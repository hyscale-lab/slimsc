Okay, so I've got this probability problem here about Jen entering a lottery. Let me try to figure it out step by step. Hmm, let's read the problem again carefully.

Jen picks 4 distinct numbers from the set S = {1,2,3,...,9,10}. Then, 4 numbers are randomly chosen from S. She wins a prize if at least two of her numbers match two of the randomly chosen numbers. She wins the grand prize if all four of her numbers match the chosen ones. We need to find the probability that she wins the grand prize given that she won a prize. The answer should be in the form of m/n where m and n are coprime, and then find m + n.

Alright, so this is a conditional probability problem. The formula for conditional probability is P(A|B) = P(A ∩ B) / P(B). In this case, event A is winning the grand prize, and event B is winning a prize. Since winning the grand prize means all four numbers match, which certainly means she also won a prize (because she has at least four matches, which is more than the required two), so A is a subset of B. Therefore, P(A ∩ B) is just P(A). So the probability we're looking for is P(A) / P(B).

So, I need to compute P(A) and P(B). Let's figure out how to find both probabilities.

First, let's model the problem. The total number of ways to choose 4 numbers from 10 is C(10,4), which is the size of the sample space. So, the total possible outcomes are C(10,4).

For event A: Winning the grand prize. This occurs only when all four numbers Jen picked are exactly the four chosen. There is only one such combination. So, the number of favorable outcomes is 1. Therefore, P(A) = 1 / C(10,4).

For event B: Winning a prize, which means that at least two of Jen's numbers are among the four chosen. So, we need to find how many ways there are to choose four numbers such that at least two of them match Jen's numbers. Alternatively, this is the complement of choosing fewer than two of Jen's numbers. Hmm, maybe it's easier to compute the number of favorable outcomes by counting all possible cases where exactly two, exactly three, or exactly four of Jen's numbers are chosen.

Yes, that makes sense. So, the number of favorable outcomes for event B is the sum of the number of ways to choose exactly 2, exactly 3, and exactly 4 numbers from Jen's 4 numbers, and the remaining numbers from the other 6 numbers in S.

So, let's denote:

- A = number of favorable outcomes for exactly 4 matches: C(4,4) * C(6,0) = 1 * 1 = 1.

- B = number of favorable outcomes for exactly 3 matches: C(4,3) * C(6,1) = 4 * 6 = 24.

- C = number of favorable outcomes for exactly 2 matches: C(4,2) * C(6,2) = 6 * 15 = 90.

So, the total number of favorable outcomes for event B is 1 + 24 + 90 = 115.

Wait, let me check that calculation. C(4,4)=1, C(4,3)=4, C(4,2)=6. Then, for the remaining numbers, we choose 0,1,2 from the 6 non-Jen numbers. So, yes, 1*1 + 4*6 + 6*15 = 1 + 24 + 90 = 115.

Therefore, P(B) = 115 / C(10,4).

We already have P(A) = 1 / C(10,4). Therefore, the conditional probability P(A|B) is P(A)/P(B) = (1 / C(10,4)) / (115 / C(10,4)) ) = 1 / 115.

Wait, that seems straightforward, but let me double-check.

Wait, C(10,4) is 210, right? Because 10 choose 4 is (10*9*8*7)/(4*3*2*1) =
