Okay, let's try to tackle this probability problem. So, Jen is entering a lottery where she picks 4 distinct numbers from the set S = {1,2,3,...,10}. Then, 4 numbers are randomly chosen from S. She wins a prize if at least two of her numbers match the randomly chosen ones. She wins the grand prize if all four of her numbers match. We need to find the probability that she wins the grand prize given that she won a prize. The answer should be in the form m/n where m and n are coprime, and then find m + n.

Hmm, okay. So, this is a conditional probability problem. The formula for conditional probability is P(A|B) = P(A ∩ B) / P(B). In this case, event A is winning the grand prize, and event B is winning a prize. So, since winning the grand prize automatically means she won a prize, P(A ∩ B) is just P(A). Therefore, the probability we're looking for is P(A)/P(B).

First, let's find P(A), the probability of winning the grand prize. That's the probability that all four of her numbers are chosen. Since the lottery picks 4 numbers out of 10, the number of possible winning combinations is C(10,4). The number of favorable outcomes is 1 (since she picked a specific set of 4 numbers). So, P(A) = 1 / C(10,4).

Wait, let me calculate C(10,4). That's 10! / (4! * (10-4)!) = (10*9*8*7)/(4*3*2*1) = 210. So, P(A) is 1/210.

Next, we need P(B), the probability of winning a prize, which means at least two of her numbers are chosen. Hmm, how do we compute that?

I remember that sometimes it's easier to compute the complement probability and subtract from 1. The complement of winning a prize is not winning a prize, which would mean having fewer than two numbers chosen. So, that is, having zero or one of her numbers chosen.

So, P(B) = 1 - P(0 or 1 number chosen from her 4). Let's compute P(0) and P(1) and subtract their sum from 1.

First, P(0): the number of ways to choose 4 numbers none of which are in her 4. So, since she has 4 numbers, the remaining numbers are 10 - 4 = 6. So, the number of ways is C(6,4). The total number of possible combinations is C(10,4), so P(0) = C(6,4)/C(10,4).

Similarly, P(1): the number of ways to choose exactly 1 of her
