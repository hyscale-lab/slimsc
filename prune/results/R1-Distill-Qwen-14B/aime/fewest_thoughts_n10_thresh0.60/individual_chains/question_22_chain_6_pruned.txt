Okay, so I have this problem about a convex equilateral hexagon. Let me try to understand it step by step. The hexagon is labeled ABCDEF, and it's equilateral, meaning all its sides are equal in length. Also, all pairs of opposite sides are parallel. That's an important property because it tells me the hexagon is not just any random shape but has some symmetry.

The problem mentions a triangle formed by extending the sides AB, CD, and EF. The lengths of these extended sides form a triangle with sides 200, 240, and 300. I need to find the side length of the hexagon.

Hmm, let me visualize this. Since the hexagon is convex and equilateral with opposite sides parallel, it must resemble a regular hexagon in some way, but not necessarily with all sides and angles equal. Wait, no, equilateral just means all sides are equal, but in a convex hexagon, the angles can vary as long as each internal angle is less than 180 degrees. But with opposite sides being parallel, the hexagon must have some regularity in its structure.

So, in a regular hexagon, all sides are equal and all opposite sides are parallel, but the angles are all 120 degrees. However, this hexagon might not have all angles equal, but since it's equilateral and opposite sides are parallel, the direction of each side must be the same as the opposite one. So, for example, AB is parallel to DE, BC is parallel to EF, and CD is parallel to FA.

Wait, that's something. So each pair of opposite sides is not only parallel but also of equal length since the hexagon is equilateral. So AB = BC = CD = DE = EF = FA = s, where s is the side length we're trying to find.

Now, the triangle formed by extending AB, CD, and EF has sides 200, 240, and 300. Let me think about how that triangle relates to the hexagon.

When we extend AB, CD, and EF, these are three sides of the hexagon, each pair of which is opposite. So, AB is extended, CD is extended, and EF is extended. Since these sides are opposite, their extensions would form a triangle. Let me imagine the hexagon inside this larger triangle.

Since the hexagon is convex, all its sides are inside the triangle. The triangle
