Okay, so I have this problem about counting the number of paths on an 8x8 grid. The paths are from the lower left corner to the upper right corner, and each path has a length of 16. They specifically want the number of such paths that change direction exactly four times. Hmm, okay, let's break this down.

First, I know that in a grid, moving from the lower left to the upper right on an 8x8 grid without any restrictions usually involves moving right and up. So, in an 8x8 grid, you have to move 8 steps right and 8 steps up, right? So the total number of steps is 16, which matches the problem statement. 

Now, the total number of such paths without any restrictions is given by the combination formula: C(16,8), which is 12870. But here, we have a restriction: the path must change direction exactly four times. So, that's a bit more complex.

I remember that when a path changes direction, it's switching from moving right to up or up to right. So, each time you change direction, you start moving in the opposite direction. So, for example, if you start by moving right, then changing direction would mean moving up, then changing direction again would mean moving right, and so on.

So, if a path changes direction exactly four times, how does that affect the structure of the path?

Let me think. Each direction change is a switch between right and up. So, starting from the lower left, the first move is either right or up. But in this case, since we're going from lower left to upper right, the path must start with some right moves and then some up moves, or vice versa. But wait, actually, the direction can change multiple times, so it might alternate between right and up multiple times.

Wait, but in a grid, you can't move in both right and up directions simultaneously. So each step is either right or up. So, when you change direction, you switch the direction you're moving in.

Now, the number of direction changes is four. So, how does that relate to the number of segments in each direction? Let's see.

If a path changes direction four times, that means it consists of five segments. Because each direction change marks the end of a segment and the start of a new one. So, for example, if you start by moving right, then change direction once to up, then change again to right, then up, then right, that's four direction changes, resulting in five segments.

So, each path with four direction changes is made up of five segments, alternating between right and up. The first segment could be either right or up, but since we're going from lower left to upper right, the overall number of right and up steps must be equal: 8 each. So, the total number of right steps is 8, and the total number of up steps is 8, but they are broken into segments by the direction changes.

Wait, but since there are five segments, and each segment is either all right or all up, the number of right segments and up segments will differ by at most one. Let me see: if we start with a right segment, then we have R, U, R, U, R, U, R (four direction changes). Wait, that's five segments: R, U, R, U, R. Wait, no, four direction changes: initial direction is R, then after first change it's U, then R, then U, then R. So, that's four direction changes, resulting in five segments: R, U, R, U, R. So, three R segments and two U segments.

Alternatively, if we start with U, then after four direction changes, we'd have U, R, U, R, U. So, three U segments and two R segments.

Wait, but the total number of right steps is 8. So, if we have k R segments, each R segment contributes some number of right steps, and similarly for U segments. So, in the case where we have three R segments and two U segments, the sum of the lengths of R segments must be 8, and the sum of the lengths of U segments must be 8.

Similarly, if we have two R segments and three U segments, same thing.

So, for each starting direction, we have two cases: starting with R or starting with U.

So, perhaps the number of such paths is the sum over both cases (starting with R or U) of the number of ways to split 8 right steps into 3 segments and 8 up steps into 2 segments, plus the number of ways to split 8 right steps into 2 segments and 8 up steps into 3 segments.

Wait, but actually, each direction change adds a segment. So, if we have four direction changes, as in four times we switch direction, that leads to five segments. So, if we start with R, the number of R segments is three and U is two. If we start with U, it's three U and two R.

So, to compute the number of paths in each case, we can compute the number of compositions of 8 into 3 parts for R and 8 into 2 parts for U, and vice versa.

Wait, what's a composition? It's a way of writing a number as the sum of positive integers, where the order matters. So, the number of compositions of 8 into k parts is C(8-1, k-1) = C(7, k-1). So, for 3 parts, it's C(7,2)=21, and for 2 parts, it's C(7,1)=7.

So, for the case starting with R:

Number of ways to split R steps: C(7,2) = 21.

Number of ways to split U steps: C(7,1) =7.

Similarly, for the case starting with U:

Number of ways to split U steps: C(7,2)=21.

Number of ways to split R steps: C(7,1)=7.

So, then the total number of paths is (21 *7) + (21 *7) = 2*(21*7) = 2*147=294.

Wait, but that seems too low compared to the total number of paths, which is 12870. So, is that correct?

Wait, let me confirm the logic again.

Each path with four direction changes will have five segments. Each segment is a consecutive run of right or up steps.

If the path starts with right, then the segments alternate R, U, R, U, R. So, three R segments and two U segments.

Each R segment has at least one step, as does each U segment. So, the number of ways to split 8 R steps into three segments is the number of compositions of 8 into three parts, which is C(7,2) =21.

Similarly, the number of ways to split 8 U steps into two parts is C(7,1)=7.

So, the number of paths starting with R is 21 *7=147.

Similarly, starting with U, the number of U segments is three, and R segments is two.

So, the number of ways to split 8 U steps into three parts is 21, and 8 R steps into two parts is 7.

So, 21*7=147.

Thus, the total number is Okay, so I have this problem about counting the number of paths on an 8x8 grid. The paths go from the lower left corner to the upper right corner, and they have a total length of 16. Also, these paths are supposed to change direction exactly four times. Hmm, let me try to break this down.

First, I remember that on an 8x8 grid, moving from one corner to the opposite usually involves moving right and up. So, the total number of steps would be 8 rights and 8 ups, totaling 16 steps. That makes sense since each step moves you one unit either right or up.

Now, the grid is 8x8, which means there are 9 horizontal lines and 9 vertical lines. But I think the number of steps is 8 in each direction, so moving from (0,0) to (8,8).

Each path is a sequence of right (R) and up (U) moves. Without any restrictions, the number of such paths is the binomial coefficient C(16,8), which is the number of ways to arrange 8 R's and 8 U's. But here, we have an added constraint: the path must change direction exactly four times.

Wait, changing direction... so each time the path switches from moving right to up or up to right, that's a direction change. So, for example, if the path goes R, R, U, U, R, U, U, U, R, R, etc., each time it switches from R to U or U to R, that's a direction change.

So, the problem is to count the number of such paths that have exactly four direction changes. Hmm, how can I model this?

I think about the structure of such paths. Each time you change direction, you're starting a new "segment." So, for four direction changes, that means the path is made up of five segments. Because each direction change separates two segments. For example, if you change direction once, you have two segments; twice would be three segments, and so on. So, four direction changes would result in five segments.

Each segment is a consecutive sequence of R's or U's. Since the path starts at (0,0), the first segment could be either R or U, but given that we need to reach (8,8), we have to alternate directions appropriately.

Wait, but on an 8x8 grid, the path has to end at (8,8), so the number of R's and U's must each be 8.

Let me think about how the direction changes relate to the number of segments. If we have k direction changes, the number of segments is k+1. So, four direction changes give five segments.

Each segment is either all R's or all U's. So, each segment contributes a certain number of steps in one direction.

Now, the total number of R's is 8, and the total number of U's is 8. So, if we have five segments, some of them are R segments, and some are U segments.

But wait, the number of R segments and U segments could vary. Let me see: the first segment could be R, then U, then R, then U, etc., or it could start with U.

But the total number of segments is five, so the number of R segments and U segments must add up to five. Also, if the path starts with R, the number of R segments is one more than U segments because the path ends with either R or U.

Wait, let's clarify. Suppose the first segment is R. Then the number of R segments would be ceil(5/2) = 3, and U segments would be 2. Or is that correct?

Wait, no. Let's think about the number of R and U segments. Suppose the path alternates between R and U segments. If it starts with R, then the segments would be R, U, R, U, R. That's five segments: three R's and two U's. Similarly, if it starts with U, it would be U, R, U, R, U: three U's and two R's.

So, in either case, the number of R segments is either three or two, same with U's. But since we have to use exactly 8 R's and 8 U's, the number of R segments and U segments must each sum to 8.

So, if the number of R segments is three, then the sum of their lengths is 8. Similarly, if the number of U segments is three, their lengths sum to 8.

Wait, in the case where we start with R and have three R segments and two U segments, the total R steps are 8 and U steps are 8. So, we need to distribute 8 R's into three segments, each at least length 1, and 8 U's into two segments, each at least length 1.

Similarly, if the number of R segments is two and U segments is three, then we distribute 8 R's into two segments and 8 U's into three segments.

So, the problem splits into two cases:

1. The path starts with R, leading to three R segments and two U segments.
2. The path starts with U, leading to three U segments and two R segments.

Therefore, the total number of paths with exactly four direction changes is the sum of the two cases.

Let me compute each case separately.

Case 1: Starting with R, so segments are R, U, R, U, R.

We need to distribute 8 R's into three segments, each at least 1. Similarly, distribute 8 U's into two segments, each at least 1.

The number of ways to distribute the R's is the number of integer solutions to x1 + x2 + x3 = 8, where each xi ≥ 1. This is C(8-1,3-1) = C(7,2) = 21.

Similarly, the number of ways to distribute the U's is C(8-1,2-1) = C(7,1) = 7.

Since the starting direction is R, the arrangement is fixed: R, U, R, U, R. So, the number of paths for this case is 21 * 7 = 147.

Case 2: Starting with U, so segments are U, R, U, R, U.

Similarly, distribute 8 U's into three segments: each at least 1. Number of ways is C(7,2) = 21.

Distribute 8 R's into two segments: each at least 1. Number of ways is C(7,1) = 7.

So, the number of paths for this case is 21 * 7 = 147.

Therefore, the total number of paths is 147 + 147 = 294.

Wait a minute, that's 294. But wait, is that correct? Let me check my reasoning.

First, in Case 1: Starting with R, three R segments and two U segments.

Each R segment is at least 1, so x1 + x2 + x3 =8, which is C(7,2)=21.

Each U segment is at least 1, so y1 + y2 =8, which is C(7,1)=7.

So, 21*7=147.

Similarly, in Case 2: Starting with U, three U segments and two R segments.

Number of ways for U's: C(7,2)=21, for R's: C(7,1)=7. So, 21 * 7=147.

Adding both cases: 294.

But wait, wait a second. The problem says "change direction exactly four times." So, in Case 1, how many direction changes are there?

Between each segment, a direction change occurs. So, if there are five segments, the number of direction changes is four. That's correct.

But let me think about another way. Each time you switch from R to U or U to R, that's a direction change. So, if you have five segments, you have four direction changes.

So, that's correct.

Wait, but in the case when starting with R, the number of direction changes is four, right? Because you switch four times between R and U.

Same when starting with U.

So, that's correct. So, each case gives 147 paths, and the total is 294.

But wait, let me think about if the starting direction affects the number of direction changes. For example, if you have a path that starts with R, then U, then R, then U, then R. So, direction changes after each segment except the last, which is four changes.

Similarly, starting with U, the same applies.

So, that seems correct.

So, the answer is 294.

Wait, but wait another thing. The grid is 8x8, so 8 squares, implying 9 lines. So, the number of steps is 16, which is correct.

But let me think about the formula again. The number of paths with exactly k direction changes is equal to the number of compositions of 8 R's into (k+1)/2 parts and 8 U's into (k+1)/2 parts if k is odd. Wait, but in our case, k is 4, which is even.

Wait, so hold on. Wait, if the number of direction changes is even, then the number of R segments and U segments would be (k/2 +1) each? No, perhaps not.

Alternatively, the formula might be more involved.

Wait, I think I need to consider the general formula for the number of paths with exactly m direction changes.

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to model it as a sequence of runs.

Each run is a consecutive sequence of R's or U's.

Each time a run changes direction, that's a direction change. So, four direction changes give five runs.

So, the problem reduces to finding the number of compositions of 8 R's into either 3 or 2 runs, and 8 U's into the remaining number of runs.

Wait, yes. So, if starting with R, the number of R runs is 3, and U runs is 2.

If starting with U, the number of U runs is 3, and R runs is 2.

So, the number of paths is the sum over both starting directions of (number of compositions of 8 R's into r runs) multiplied by (number of compositions of 8 U's into u runs), where r and u are 3 and 2 or 2 and 3, respectively.

So, for starting with R: 8 R's into 3 runs, each at least 1. The number is C(8-1,3-1) = C(7,2) = 21.

8 U's into 2 runs: C(7,1)=7.

So, 21 *7=147.

Similarly, starting with U: 8 U's into 3 runs: 21, and 8 R's into 2 runs:7. So, 21 *7=147.

Total: 294.

So, that seems consistent.

Alternatively, I can think of it as the sum over starting direction and then the number of compositions.

Therefore, the total number of such paths is 2 * [C(7,2) * C(7,1)] = 2 * (21 *7) = 294.

Wait, but let me think if I missed any other cases.

Is there a case where the number of direction changes is four, but the number of runs is different? Hmm, four direction changes must mean five runs, so if we have five runs, the number of R runs and U runs must differ by one. Because starting with R, the runs alternate R, U, R, U, R. So, three R runs and two U runs. Similarly for starting with U.

Thus, the total is two possibilities, each contributing C(7,2)*C(7,1)=147, so total 294.

Therefore, the answer is 294.

Wait, but let me double-check by considering a smaller grid. Let's say a 2x2 grid, and paths of length 4. Suppose we want the number of paths that change direction exactly two times.

In a 2x2 grid, moving from (0,0) to (2,2). Total steps: 4.

Number of direction changes: two.

So, the path would have three runs.

Let's compute according to the formula.

If starting with R, then the runs would be R, U, R.

Distribute 2 R's into two runs: each at least 1. The number of ways is C(1,1)=1.

Distribute 2 U's into one run: C(1,0)=1.

So, 1 *1=1 path.

Similarly, starting with U: runs are U, R, U.

Distribute 2 U's into two runs: 1 way.

Distribute 2 R's into one run:1 way.

So, 1 *1=1 path.

Total: 2 paths.

But wait, let's list them.

Starting with R: RRUU, but wait, that's only two runs. Wait, no.

Wait, in a 2x2 grid, changing direction exactly two times.

So, starting with R: R, U, R. So, for example, R U R U.

Wait, no, that's four direction changes, but in a 2x2 grid. Wait, perhaps I'm making a mistake.

Wait, in a 2x2 grid, the path from (0,0) to (2,2) can be represented as a sequence of R and U steps.

Total steps: 2 R and 2 U.

If a path changes direction exactly two times, that implies it has three runs.

So, for example, RRUU has one run of R and one run of U, so only one direction change.

RURU has three runs, so two direction changes.

Similarly, URRU, etc.

Wait, let me count the number of such paths.

Each path with exactly two direction changes must have three runs.

So, starting with R: R, U, R. The lengths of the runs must be >=1.

So, distribute 2 R into two runs: each run is at least 1.

Only one way: 1 and 1.

Distribute 2 U into one run: only one way: 2.

So, the path is R R UU? Wait, no, that's two runs.

Wait, perhaps I need to model it correctly.

Wait, the runs are R, U, R. So, the first R run is at least 1, the U run is at least 1, the last R run is at least 1.

So, in terms of distributing 2 R's into three runs, each at least 1. But 2 R's can't be split into three runs each >=1. Because 3 runs each of at least 1 would require 3 R's, but we have only 2.

Ah, here's a mistake in my earlier logic.

Wait, perhaps in the 2x2 grid, it's not possible to have three runs if starting with R because we don't have enough steps.

Wait, let's see: to have three runs starting with R, you need R, U, R. Each run must be at least 1. So, the R's would be split into two runs (since starting and ending with R), each at least 1, so total R's would be at least 2. Similarly, U's would be in one run, at least 1. So, total steps would be R1 + U1 + R2, where R1 >=1, R2 >=1, U1 >=1.

So, for total R's: R1 + R2 =2. So, the number of ways to distribute R's is C(2-1,2-1)=C(1,1)=1.

Similarly, distributing U's into one run is 1 way.

So, the path would be R1, U1, R2.

Which would be R, U, R, each run of length 1. So, the path is RURU. Wait, that's four steps, which in a 2x2 grid would be R, U, R, U, but that's four steps, which is 2 R's and 2 U's, correct.

But in a 2x2 grid, to go from (0,0) to (2,2), you need four steps: 2 R and 2 U.

So, RURU is a valid path with two direction changes. Similarly, URUR is another.

Wait, but according to my earlier calculation for the starting with R case, the number of such paths would be 1, but in reality, there's only one path starting with R, which is RURU.

Wait, but the way I computed earlier, I considered distributing R's into two runs (since starting and ending with R, the number of R runs is two, which are R1 and R2) and U's into one run.

Wait, so in the 2x2 grid, starting with R, the number of R runs is two, the number of U runs is one.

So, distributing 2 R's into two runs: each at least 1. So, 1 way (1 and 1).

Distributing 2 U's into one run: 1 way.

So, 1 *1=1 path: RURU.

Similarly, starting with U: two U runs and one R run. So, distribute 2 U's into two runs:1 way, and 2 R's into one run:1 way. So, path is URUR.

So, total paths with exactly two direction changes: 2.

Which is correct.

So, my initial formula seems to hold: for each starting direction, the number is C(r-1, k-1) * C(u-1, m-1), where r is the number of steps in one direction, k is the number of runs, and similarly for u.

So, in the 2x2 grid, with two direction changes (three runs), starting with R:

Number of R runs: if starting with R, then the number of R runs is (number of runs +1)/2 if the number of runs is odd. Wait, no.

Wait, for three runs, starting with R: R, U, R. So, two R runs and one U run.

So, distributing R's into two runs: C(2-1,2-1)=1.

Distributing U's into one run: C(2-1,1-1)=C(1,0)=1.

So, 1 *1=1.

Similarly for starting with U: two U runs and one R run.

Distributing U's into two runs:1 way.

Distributing R's into one run:1 way.

Total: 1 +1=2, which is correct.

So, going back to the original problem, the formula seems correct.

Thus, in the 8x8 grid, with four direction changes, leading to five runs, and the number of R runs and U runs are either three and two or two and three.

So, each case contributes C(7,2)*C(7,1)=21*7=147.

So, total is 147*2=294.

Thus, the answer is 294.

Wait, but I have a doubt. Suppose the path starts with R and has three R runs and two U runs. The way we compute is by considering the number of compositions of 8 into three parts for R, and 8 into two parts for U.

But wait, each composition corresponds to a different way of placing the direction changes. So, for R's: in three runs, each run must have at least one R. So, the number of ways is C(8-1,3-1)=C(7,2)=21.

Similarly, for U's in two runs: C(7,1)=7.

So, 21 *7=147.

Same for starting with U.

Therefore, 294 is the correct answer.

I think I've considered all the cases and the formula holds. So, I'll go with 294.


To solve the problem of counting the number of paths of length 16 from the lower left corner to the upper right corner on an 8x8 grid that change direction exactly four times, we analyze the structure of such paths.

Each path consists of 8 right (R) moves and 8 up (U) moves. A direction change occurs when the path switches from R to U or U to R. For exactly four direction changes, the path is divided into five segments (runs), alternating between R and U.

There are two cases to consider:

1. **Starting with R**: The path has three R segments and two U segments.
   - Distribute 8 R's into three segments: \( \binom{7}{2} = 21 \) ways.
   - Distribute 8 U's into two segments: \( \binom{7}{1} = 7 \) ways.
   - Total paths for this case: \( 21 \times 7 = 147 \).

2. **Starting with U**: The path has three U segments and two R segments.
   - Distribute 8 U's into three segments: \( \binom{7}{2} = 21 \) ways.
   - Distribute 8 R's into two segments: \( \binom{7}{1} = 7 \) ways.
   - Total paths for this case: \( 21 \times 7 = 147 \).

Adding both cases, the total number of paths is \( 147 + 147 = 294 \).

\boxed{294}
