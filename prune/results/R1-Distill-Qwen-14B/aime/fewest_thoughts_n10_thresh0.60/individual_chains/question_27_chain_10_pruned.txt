Okay, so I'm trying to solve this math problem about a torus and a sphere. Let me read it again and make sure I understand what's being asked.

We have a torus T, which is formed by revolving a circle of radius 3 around an axis in the same plane as the circle. The distance from the center of the circle to the axis is 6 units. So, it's like a donut shape where the major radius (the distance from the center of the tube to the center of the torus) is 6, and the minor radius (the radius of the tube itself) is 3.

Then there's a sphere S with radius 11. The problem says when T rests on the inside of S, it's internally tangent along a circle with radius r_i, and when it rests on the outside, it's externally tangent along a circle with radius r_o. We need to find the difference r_i - r_o, express it as a reduced fraction m/n, and then find m + n.

Hmm, okay. So, I think I need to visualize both cases: the torus inside the sphere and the torus outside the sphere, and in each case, find the radius of the circle along which they are tangent.

Let me start by recalling some properties of tori and spheres. A torus can be thought of as a surface of revolution, generated by rotating a circle around an external axis. The major radius R is the distance from the center of the generating circle to the axis of revolution, and the minor radius r is the radius of the generating circle itself. So in our case, R is 6 and r is 3.

When the torus is placed inside the sphere, it's tangent internally. That probably means the sphere is larger, and the torus touches the sphere at some circle. Similarly, when the torus is placed outside, it's externally tangent, so maybe the sphere is smaller? Wait, but in the problem, the sphere has a fixed radius of 11. Wait, no, wait. When the torus is inside, it's resting on the inside of the sphere, so the sphere is fixed with radius 11, and the torus is inside it. Then when it's outside, the torus is outside the sphere, so maybe the sphere is inside the torus? Hmm, perhaps not. Wait, maybe I need to think about the positions more carefully.

Wait, no. If the torus is resting on the inside of the sphere, that means the torus is positioned such that the sphere is outside, and the torus is tangent to the sphere from the inside. Similarly, when the torus rests on the outside, the sphere is inside, and the torus is tangent to the sphere from the outside.

So, in both cases, the center of the sphere and the center of the torus must lie along the same line, perhaps? Or maybe not. Let me think.

Wait, perhaps it's better to model the torus as a surface in 3D space and figure out the points where it's tangent to the sphere. Alternatively, maybe I can model the problem in 2D first, as a circle rolled around another circle, but I'm not sure if
