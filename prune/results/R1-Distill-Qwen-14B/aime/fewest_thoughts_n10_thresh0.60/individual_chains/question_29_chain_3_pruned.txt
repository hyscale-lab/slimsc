Okay, so I'm trying to solve this geometry problem, and I need to visualize it first. Let me try to sketch the scenario in my mind. There are two rectangles, ABCD and EFGH. Points D, E, C, F are collinear. Also, points A, D, H, G lie on a circle. The given lengths are BC=16, AB=107, FG=17, and EF=184. I need to find the length of CE.

First, let's note the properties of the rectangles. In rectangle ABCD, opposite sides are equal, so AB=CD=107 and BC=AD=16. Similarly, in rectangle EFGH, opposite sides are equal, so EF=GH=184 and FG=EH=17.

Since D, E, C, F are collinear, they lie on a straight line. Let me denote this line as line l. So, points D and C are vertices of rectangle ABCD, and E and F are vertices of rectangle EFGH. So, the order on line l is probably D-E-C-F? Or maybe another order? Hmm, I need to figure that out.

Wait, rectangles have right angles. So, points A, D, H, G are on a circle. That means quadrilateral ADHG is cyclic. A cyclic quadrilateral satisfies certain properties, like the sum of opposite angles being 180 degrees. But maybe more useful for this problem is the power of a point or similar theorems.

Let me try to sketch this. Imagine rectangle ABCD with AB=107 and BC=16, so it's a tall, narrow rectangle. Then rectangle EFGH is another rectangle, with EF=184 and FG=17, which is a much longer and wider rectangle. Points D, E, C, F are on the same line.

Wait, so in rectangle ABCD, D is a corner. So, if D is on line l along with E, C, F, then perhaps E is next to D, then C, then F? Or maybe another order. Alternatively, maybe D and C are on one side, and E and F are on the other side, but still on the same line. Hmm, perhaps I should try to assign coordinates.

Let me assign coordinate system to this. Let me place point D at the origin (0,0). Since ABCD is a
