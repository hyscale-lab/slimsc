Okay, so I have this geometry problem here, and I need to figure out the value of OC² where point C is on segment AB, but it's unique in that it's only on AB and not on any other segment from this family F. Let me try to unpack the problem step by step.

First, let's understand the setup. We have points O at (0,0), A at (1/2, 0), and B at (0, sqrt(3)/2). So, O is the origin, A is on the x-axis, and B is on the y-axis. The segment AB connects these two points. 

Next, there's this family F of segments PQ. Each PQ is of unit length, lies in the first quadrant, with P on the x-axis and Q on the y-axis. So, each segment PQ starts at some point P(p, 0) on the x-axis and ends at Q(0, q) on the y-axis, such that the distance between P and Q is 1. Since they are in the first quadrant, p and q are positive numbers.

The problem states that there's a unique point C on AB, different from A and B, that doesn't lie on any other segment from F except AB itself. So, AB is one of these segments PQ, and C is a point on AB that isn't on any other PQ segment in F. We need to find OC², which is the square of the distance from the origin to point C.

So, first, I need to find the equation of line AB. Let's see: A is (1/2, 0) and B is (0, sqrt(3)/2). The slope of AB would be (sqrt(3)/2 - 0)/(0 - 1/2) = (sqrt(3)/2)/(-1/2) = -sqrt(3). So, the equation of AB is y = -sqrt(3)x + c. Plugging in point A: 0 = -sqrt(3)*(1/2) + c => c = sqrt(3)/2. So, the equation is y = -sqrt(3)x + sqrt(3)/2.

Next, I need to consider the family F of segments PQ of unit length with P on the x-axis and Q on the y-axis. Let's parameterize these segments. Let P be (p, 0) and Q be (0, q). The distance PQ is sqrt(p² + q²) = 1. So, p² + q² = 1. 

So, for each p between 0 and 1, q would be sqrt(1 - p²), but since they are in the first quadrant, q is positive. So, each segment PQ is from (p, 0) to (0, sqrt(1 - p²)).

Now, any point on PQ can be parametrized. Let me think. Let's say a point on PQ is given by (p - tp, 0 + t*sqrt(1 - p²)) where t ranges from 0 to 1. So, when t=0, it's at P, and t=1, it's at Q. Alternatively, since PQ is a straight line, the parametric equations can be written as x = p(1 - t) and y = q*t, where t is from 0 to 1.

Alternatively, using a parameter s, which might be more convenient, we can write x = p*(1 - s) and y = q*s, where s ∈ [0,1]. So, each point on PQ is (p(1 - s), q s). Since p² + q² = 1, we can use that to relate p and q.

Now, the key point is that the point C lies on AB and is not on any other PQ segment except AB itself. So, for C to be unique, it must be that the only PQ segment that passes through C is AB. So, AB is in F, and C is on AB, but for any other PQ in F, C is not on it.

So, to find C, we need to find a point on AB that only lies on AB and no other PQ from F.

Alternatively, since AB is itself a segment in F, with P at A (1
