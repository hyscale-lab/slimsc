Okay, so I've got this math problem here, and I need to figure out how many residents of Aimeville own all four things: a diamond ring, a set of golf clubs, a garden spade, and a bag of candy hearts. Let me try to break this down step by step.

First, the problem gives me some numbers:

- Total residents: 900
- Residents owning a diamond ring (let's call this D): 195
- Residents owning a set of golf clubs (G): 367
- Residents owning a garden spade (S): 562
- Everyone owns a bag of candy hearts (H), so that's 900 as well.
  
Wait, the problem says each of the 900 residents owns a bag of candy hearts. So H is universal here. That might simplify things a bit because everyone has H, so any overlaps will automatically include H. Hmm, that's something to note.

Then, it also says that 437 residents own exactly two of these things, and 234 own exactly three. The question is asking for the number of residents who own all four. So, we need to find the number of people who have D, G, S, and H.

I think this is a problem that uses the principle of inclusion-exclusion. I remember that inclusion-exclusion helps calculate the union of multiple sets by considering all possible intersections. But since there are four sets here (D, G, S, H), the formula might get a bit complicated, but let's try.

Wait, but H is universal, right? So every resident has H. That means that when considering the overlaps between D, G, and S, H is always included. So maybe the problem can be simplified by treating H as a given, and focusing on the overlaps among D, G, S, with H being automatically included.

But wait, the problem is asking for those who have all four. Since everyone has H, having all four is equivalent to having D, G, S, and H. But since H is already included in everyone, the count for all four will be the same as those who have D, G, S, because H is always there.

Wait, but the problem is phrased as "own all four of these things," which includes H. So, yeah, exactly.

So, to approach this, perhaps I can use the inclusion-exclusion principle for four sets, but I'm not sure if that's necessary. Alternatively, maybe it's easier to consider only the three items D, G, S because H is already given to everyone.

Let me think. Since everyone owns H, the counts for people owning exactly two or three things will include H automatically. So, maybe the problem reduces to finding the number of people who own all three of D, G, S, because that's the same as owning all four (since H is already included).

Wait, but the problem mentions that 437 own exactly two things and 234 own exactly three. Oh wait, exactly three of what? Because H is already given to everyone, so when someone owns exactly three things, does that include H? Let me clarify.

The problem states that 437 residents own exactly two of these things. The "these things" refer to diamond ring, golf clubs, garden spade, and candy hearts. So yes, the two things could include H or not. Similarly, 234 own exactly three, which could include H.

But since everyone has H, the number of people who own exactly two things must include H in one of them. Wait, no. Because if someone owns exactly two things, and H is one of them, then they own H and one other. Alternatively, could someone own two things without H? No, because the problem says each of the 900 owns a bag of candy hearts. So, no one can own a set without H. So, everyone has H. Therefore, any ownership must include H.

So, if someone owns exactly two things, it's H plus one other. Similarly, someone owning exactly three things is H plus two others. And someone owning all four is H plus the other three.

Wait, that's an important point. So, the categories are:

- Exactly one thing: impossible, because everyone has H, so they must have at least H. But wait, the problem says each owns a bag of candy hearts, so H is included in all. So, can someone own only H? Or must they own at least one more? The problem doesn't specify, but the counts given are for people owning exactly two or three of the four things. So, maybe someone owns exactly two, three, or four items, but let me see.

Wait, the problem says: 437 own exactly two of these things, 234 own exactly three, and the rest would be those who own one or four. But since H is included in all, owning exactly one thing would mean they only have H, but the problem doesn't specify how many own exactly one. Hmm, perhaps I can model this with inclusion-exclusion.

But perhaps another approach is to consider the total number of ownerships across all four items and then use that to find overlaps.

The total number of ownerships is the sum of the number of people owning each item.

So, D is 195, G is 367, S is 562, H is 900.

Total ownerships = 195 + 367 + 562 + 900.

Let me compute that:

195 + 367 = 562; 562 + 562 = 1124; 1124 + 900 = 2024.

Wait, 195 + 367 is 562? Let me check: 195 + 300 is 495, plus 67 is 562. Yes. 562 + 562 is 1124, plus 900 is 2024.

So total ownerships are 2024.

Now, each person can be counted multiple times depending on how many items they own. Let's denote the number of people who own exactly k items as E_k. But in this problem, we know E_2 = 437, E_3 = 234, and we need to find E_4, which is the number who own all four.

Wait, but we don't know E_1, the number of people who own exactly one item. But since H is included in everyone, can someone own exactly one item? That would mean they have only H and nothing else. So, E_1 could be non-zero.

Let me see: the total number of residents is 900. So, E_1 + E_2 + E_3 + E_4 = 900.

We know E_2 = 437, E_3 = 234. So, E_1 + E_4 = 900 - 437 - 234 = let's compute that:

900 - 437 is 463, then 463 - 234 is 229. So, E_1 + E_4 = 229.

But E_1 is the number of people who own exactly one item, which can only be H. Because if you own exactly one item, and H is already included, then you can't own anything else. So, E_1 is the number of people who own only H.

So, E_1 = number of people with only H.

Now, the total ownerships can also be calculated by considering how many times each person contributes to the total. Each person contributes as many times as the number of items they own. So, for E_1, each contributes 1 (only H). For E_2, each contributes 2 (H and one other). For E_3, each contributes 3 (H and two others). For E_4, each contributes 4 (all four).

So, the total ownerships can be expressed as:

Total = 1*E_1 + 2*E_2 + 3*E_3 + 4*E_4

We know E_2 = 437, E_3 = 234, and E_1 + E_4 = 229.

So, let's plug in the numbers:

2024 = (1)(E_1) + 2*(437) + 3*(234) + 4*E_4

Compute 2*437: that's 874.

Compute 3*234: 702.

So, 2024 = E_1 + 874 + 702 + 4E_4.

Adding 874 + 702: 874 + 700 is 1574, plus 2 is 1576.

So, 2024 = E_1 + 1576 + 4E_4.

Let me rewrite this as:

E_1 + 4E_4 = 2024 - 1576 = 448.

And from before, we have E_1 + E_4 = 229.

So, now we have two equations:

1. E_1 + E_4 = 229

2. E_1 + 4E_4 = 448

Subtract equation 1 from equation 2:

(E_1 + 4E_4) - (E_1 + E_4) = 448 - 229

This simplifies to 3E_4 = 219.

So, E_4 = 219 / 3 = 73.

So, the number of residents who own all four items is 73.

Wait a second, let me confirm that. So, 3E4 = 219, so E4 is 73. That seems right.

But let me just make sure I didn't make any calculation errors.

So, total ownerships: 195 (D) + 367 (G) + 562 (S) + 900 (H) = 2024.

Total ownerships are also E1 + 2E2 + 3E3 +4E4.

E2 is 437, E3 is 234.

Then, total ownerships: E1 + 874 + 702 +4E4 = E1 + 1576 +4E4 = 2024.

So, E1 +4E4 =2024 -1576= 448.

We also know E1 + E4=229.

Subtracting the second equation from the first: 3E4=219 => E4=73.

Yes, that seems correct.

So, the number of residents who own all four is 73.


To determine the number of residents who own all four items (diamond ring, golf clubs, garden spade, and candy hearts), we use the principle of inclusion-exclusion and the given data:

- Total residents: 900
- Residents owning diamond ring (D): 195
- Residents owning golf clubs (G): 367
- Residents owning garden spade (S): 562
- Residents owning candy hearts (H): 900 (universal)
- Residents owning exactly two items: 437
- Residents owning exactly three items: 234

First, calculate the total number of ownerships:

\[
\text{Total ownerships} = D + G + S + H = 195 + 367 + 562 + 900 = 2024
\]

Let \( E_1 \) be the number of residents owning exactly one item, \( E_2 = 437 \) (exactly two items), \( E_3 = 234 \) (exactly three items), and \( E_4 \) be the number of residents owning all four items. The total number of residents is:

\[
E_1 + E_2 + E_3 + E_4 = 900
\]

Substituting known values:

\[
E_1 + 437 + 234 + E_4 = 900 \implies E_1 + E_4 = 229
\]

The total ownerships can also be expressed as:

\[
\text{Total ownerships} = 1 \cdot E_1 + 2 \cdot E_2 + 3 \cdot E_3 + 4 \cdot E_4
\]

Substituting the known values:

\[
2024 = E_1 + 2(437) + 3(234) + 4E_4
\]

Calculate the terms:

\[
2(437) = 874, \quad 3(234) = 702
\]

So,

\[
2024 = E_1 + 874 + 702 + 4E_4 \implies E_1 + 4E_4 = 448
\]

Now, we have two equations:

1. \( E_1 + E_4 = 229 \)
2. \( E_1 + 4E_4 = 448 \)

Subtracting the first equation from the second:

\[
(E_1 + 4E_4) - (E_1 + E_4) = 448 - 229 \implies 3E_4 = 219 \implies E_4 = 73
\]

Thus, the number of residents who own all four items is:

\boxed{73}
