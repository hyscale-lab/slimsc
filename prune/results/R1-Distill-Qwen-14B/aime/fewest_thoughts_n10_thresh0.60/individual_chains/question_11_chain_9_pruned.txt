Alright, so I've got this problem here: I need to find the largest possible real part of the expression (75 + 117i)z + (96 + 144i)/z, where z is a complex number with |z| = 4. Hmm, okay, let's unpack this step by step.

First off, I remember that for complex numbers, especially when dealing with expressions like this, it's often useful to express z in polar form. Since the modulus of z is given as 4, that might simplify things. So, let me write z as 4e^{iθ}, where θ is the argument of z. That should make calculations easier because I can separate the modulus and the argument, which might help in simplifying the expression.

So, z = 4e^{iθ}, right? Then, 1/z would be (1/4)e^{-iθ}, since the reciprocal of a complex number in polar form is just the reciprocal of the modulus and the negative of the argument. So, substituting these into the expression:

(75 + 117i)z = (75 + 117i) * 4e^{iθ}
and
(96 + 144i)/z = (96 + 144i) * (1/4)e^{-iθ} = (24 + 36i)e^{-iθ}

So, the entire expression becomes:

(75 + 117i) * 4e^{iθ} + (24 + 36i)e^{-iθ}

Let me compute those coefficients first. Calculating (75 + 117i) * 4:

75 * 4 = 300 and 117 * 4 = 468, so it's 300 + 468i. So, the first term is (300 + 468i)e^{iθ}.

The second term is (24 + 36i)e^{-iθ}, which I can leave as it is for now.

So, putting it together:

Expression = (300 + 468i)e^{iθ} + (24 + 36i)e^{-iθ}

Hmm, now I need to find the real part of this expression because the problem is asking for the largest possible real part. So, I should compute Re[Expression].

To compute the real part, I'll use the fact that for any complex number a + ib, Re[(a + ib)e^{iθ}] = a cosθ - b sinθ, because e^{iθ} = cosθ + isinθ, and when you multiply (a + ib)(cosθ + isinθ), the real part becomes a cosθ - b sinθ.

So, applying this to each term:

First term: Re[(300 + 468i)e^{iθ}] = 300 cosθ - 468 sinθ
Second term: Re[(24 + 36i)e^{-iθ}] = Re[(24 + 36i)(cosθ - isinθ)] = 24 cosθ + 36 sinθ

Wait, because when I have e^{-iθ} = cosθ - isinθ. So, multiplying (24 + 36i) by (cosθ - isinθ) would give:

24 cosθ - 24i sinθ + 36i cosθ - 36i^2 sinθ

But since i^2 = -1, the last term becomes +36 sinθ. So, the real part is 24 cosθ + 36 sinθ.

So, combining both real parts:

Real part of Expression = (300 cosθ - 468 sinθ) + (24 cosθ + 36 sinθ)
= (300 + 24) cosθ + (-468 + 36) sinθ
= 324 cosθ - 432 sinθ

So, the expression I need to maximize is 324 cosθ - 432 sinθ.

Hmm, okay. So, now the problem reduces to finding the maximum value of 324 cosθ - 432 sinθ. I think this is a standard problem in trigonometry where you have an expression of the form A cosθ + B sinθ, and you want to find its maximum value.

I remember that the maximum value of A cosθ + B sinθ is sqrt(A^2 + B^2). So, in this case, A is 324 and B is -432.

So, the maximum value should be sqrt(324^2 + 432^2). Let me compute that.

First, let me calculate 324^2 and 432^2.

324^2: 324 * 324. Let me compute that.

Well, 300^2 = 90,000. 24^2 = 576. Then, 2*300*24 = 14,400. So, (300+24)^2 = 300^2 + 2*300*24 + 24^2 = 90,000 + 14,400 + 576 = 90,000 + 14,400 is 104,400; plus 576 is 104,976. So, 324^2 is 104,976.

432^2: Let's compute 400^2 = 160,000. 32^2=1,024. Then, 2*400*32=25,600. So, (400+32)^2 = 400^2 + 2*400*32 + 32^2 = 160,000 + 25,600 + 1,024 = 160,000 +25,600=185,600 +1,024=186,624.

So, 324^2 + 432^2 = 104,976 + 186,624 = Let's compute that. 104,976 + 186,624.

Adding the thousands: 100,000 + 180,000 = 280,000. Then, 4,976 + 6,624 = 11,600. So, total is 280,000 + 11,600 = 291,600.

So, sqrt(291,600). Hmm, what's the square of 540? 540^2 is 291,600 because 500^2 is 250,000, and 40^2 is 1,600. 2*500*40=40,000. So, 500+40=540, 540^2=500^2 + 2*500*40 +40^2=250,000 +40,000 + 1,600=291,600. Yep, so sqrt(291,600)=540.

So, the maximum real part is 540.

Wait, but let me make sure I applied the formula correctly. The formula says that the maximum of A cosθ + B sinθ is sqrt(A^2 + B^2). But in our case, B is negative. Does that affect anything? Well, the maximum would be the same regardless of the sign because it's squared. So, sqrt(324^2 + (-432)^2) is sqrt(324^2 + 432^2)=540. So, yes, the maximum real part is 540.

Alternatively, if I didn't remember the formula, I could approach it using calculus. Let me try that method as a double-check.

The expression is 324 cosθ -432 sinθ. Let's call this function f(θ) = 324 cosθ -432 sinθ. To find its maximum, take the derivative with respect to θ and set it to zero.

f'(θ) = -324 sinθ -432 cosθ.

Set f'(θ)=0: -324 sinθ
