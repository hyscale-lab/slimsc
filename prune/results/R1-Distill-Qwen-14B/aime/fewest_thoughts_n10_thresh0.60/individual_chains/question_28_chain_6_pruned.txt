Okay, so I have this problem about a tetrahedron ABCD with specific edge lengths, and I need to find the distance from the incenter (the point equidistant from all faces) to each face. The distance should be expressed in a certain form, and then I have to find the sum m + n + p.

First, let me try to visualize the tetrahedron. It has four triangular faces, and all the opposite edges are equal. That is, AB = CD, AC = BD, and BC = AD. The lengths given are AB = CD = √41, AC = BD = √80, and BC = AD = √89. 

Hmm, this seems like a symmetrical tetrahedron. Maybe it's a kind of isosceles tetrahedron, where opposite edges are equal. I remember that in such tetrahedrons, the incenter coincides with the centroid and the circumcenter because of the symmetry. So, the point I we're looking for is probably the centroid.

But wait, is that true? Let me think. In a regular tetrahedron, all edges are equal, and all these centers coincide. But in an isosceles tetrahedron (where opposite edges are equal but not necessarily all edges equal), the centroid, incenter, circumcenter, and orthocenter all coincide. So, I think that's the case here.

So, the inradius (the distance from the incenter to each face) can be found using the formula:

r = 3V / S

where V is the volume of the tetrahedron and S is the total surface area.

So, I need to find the volume V and the surface area S of the tetrahedron.

But how? I know all the edge lengths, so maybe I can compute the volume using the Cayley-Menger determinant, which allows computing the volume of a tetrahedron given all its edge lengths.

Yes, the Cayley-Menger determinant for a tetrahedron with edge lengths AB = a, AC = b, AD = c, BC = d, BD = e, CD = f is given by:

CM = | 0  1    1    1    1  |
        | 1  0  a²  b²  c² |
        | 1  a² 0  d²  e² |
        | 1  b² d² 0  f² |
        | 1  c² e² f² 0  |

The volume V is then sqrt( CM / 288 ).

Alternatively, the formula is:

288 V² = determinant of the Cayley-Menger matrix.

So, let's write down the Cayley-Menger matrix for this tetrahedron.

First, list all the edge lengths:

AB = √41, so AB² = 41

AC = √80, so AC² = 80

AD = √89, so AD² = 89

BC = √89, so BC² = 89

BD = √80, so BD² = 80

CD = √41, so CD² = 41

So, the Cayley-Menger matrix is:

Row 0: 0, 1, 1, 1, 1

Row 1: 1, 0, 41, 80, 89

Row 2: 1, 41, 0, 89, 80

Row 3: 1, 80, 89, 0, 41

Row 4: 1, 89, 80, 41, 0

Wait, let me check:

Wait, the Cayley-Menger matrix is a 5x5 matrix. The first row is [0, 1, 1, 1, 1], the first column is [0, 1, 1, 1, 1]^T.

Then, the other elements
