Okay, so I have this geometry problem here. Let me try to parse it step by step. 

We have triangle ABC inscribed in a circle ω. Tangents to ω at B and C intersect at point D. Then, the line AD intersects ω again at point P. The lengths of the sides are given: AB is 5, BC is 9, and AC is 10. I need to find AP, which can be written as a fraction m/n where m and n are coprime, and then find m + n.

Hmm, okay. So let me try to visualize this. Triangle ABC with sides AB=5, BC=9, AC=10. So it's a scalene triangle. The circle ω is the circumcircle of ABC.

First, tangents at B and C meet at D. So D is the ex-pole or the exsimilicenter of BC? Wait, tangents from D to ω touch at B and C, so D lies on the external tangent from BC. So, D is the intersection of the two tangents at B and C. So in other words, D is the ex-pole of BC with respect to ω.

Wait, actually, in triangle ABC, the point where the tangents at B and C meet is called the symmedian point or something? Hmm, maybe not. Alternatively, I think that point is called the exsymmedian point or maybe it's the Gergonne point? Wait, no, the Gergonne point is related to the incircle. Maybe it's the ex-pole of BC. Alternatively, perhaps it's the point D such that DB and DC are tangents to ω.

Yes, that's correct. So point D is such that DB is tangent to ω at B and DC is tangent to ω at C. So D lies outside the circle ω, and DB and DC are tangent segments.

Now, line AD intersects ω again at P. So starting from A, drawing a line to D, which is outside the circle, and then where it intersects the circle again is point P. So AP is the length from A to P. So we need to find the length of AP.

I remember that in such configurations, there might be some power of a point or similar triangle properties that can be used. Let me recall the power of a point theorem
