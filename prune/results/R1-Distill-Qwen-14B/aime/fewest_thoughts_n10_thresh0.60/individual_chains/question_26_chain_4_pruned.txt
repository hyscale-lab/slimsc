Okay, so I have this geometry problem here. Let me try to visualize it first. There's a triangle ABC inscribed in a circle ω. The tangents at points B and C to the circle ω intersect at point D. Then, the line AD intersects ω again at point P. We're given the lengths AB=5, BC=9, and AC=10. We need to find the length AP, express it as a reduced fraction m/n, and then find m + n.

Hmm, let me recall some geometry concepts. Since D is the intersection of the tangents at B and C, D is called the exsymmedian point or the symmedian point? Wait, no, the symmedian point is inside the triangle, but D is outside because it's the intersection of two tangents. So D is the exsymmedian point? Or maybe it's the ex-pole of something.

Wait, tangents from a common external point are equal in length. So DB = DC because both are tangents from D to ω. So triangle DBC is isoceles with DB = DC.

I think I can use the power of point D with respect to ω. The power of D is equal to DB² = DC², and it's also equal to DP * DA because AD is a secant. So, Power of a Point theorem: DB² = DP * DA.

So if I can find DB, then I can relate it to AP. But how?

Wait, AP is the segment from A to P, where P is on AD. So, AP = AD - DP. Hmm, but I don't know AD or DP yet.

Alternatively, maybe I can express AP in terms of AD and DP. From the power of point D: DB² = DP * DA. So, DP = DB² / DA. Then, AP = AD - DP = AD - (DB² / DA) = (AD² - DB²)/AD.

But I don't know AD or DB yet. Hmm.

Another approach: Maybe use coordinates or trigonometry? Or perhaps use properties of triangles and circles.

Wait, the triangle ABC has sides AB=5, BC=9, and AC=10. Let me compute the semiperimeter, area, and maybe circumradius.

First, semiperimeter s = (5 + 9 + 10)/2
