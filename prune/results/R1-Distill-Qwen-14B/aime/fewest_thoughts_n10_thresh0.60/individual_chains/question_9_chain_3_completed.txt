Okay, so I've got this problem here. It says that there are real numbers x and y, both greater than 1, such that log base x of y^x equals 10, and log base y of x^{4y} also equals 10. And I need to find the product xy. Hmm, alright, let's break this down.

First, let's write down the equations as given. The first equation is log_x(y^x) = 10. The second one is log_y(x^{4y}) = 10. I remember some logarithm rules, so maybe I can simplify these.

Starting with the first equation: log_x(y^x). Using the logarithm power rule, which says log_b(a^n) = n * log_b(a), this should simplify. So, that would be x * log_x(y) = 10. Hmm, right.

Similarly, for the second equation: log_y(x^{4y}). Again, applying the power rule, that becomes 4y * log_y(x) = 10.

So now I have two equations:
1. x * log_x(y) = 10
2. 4y * log_y(x) = 10

Let me think about how to relate these two. I remember that log_b(a) is the reciprocal of log_a(b). So, log_x(y) = 1 / log_y(x). That should be helpful.

Let me denote log_x(y) as A. Then, log_y(x) would be 1/A. So, substituting into the equations:

1. x * A = 10 → Equation (1)
2. 4y * (1/A) = 10 → Equation (2)

So now I have:

Equation (1): x * A = 10  
Equation (2): (4y)/A = 10

Hmm, maybe I can solve for A from both equations and set them equal? Or perhaps solve one equation for a variable and substitute into the other.

From Equation (1): A = 10 / x  
From Equation (2): 4y / A = 10 → A = (4y) / 10 = (2y)/5

So, A = 10/x and A = 2y/5. Therefore, 10/x = 2y/5.

Let me write that down:

10/x = (2y)/5

Cross-multiplying, 10 * 5 = 2y * x  
So, 50 = 2xy → xy = 25.

Wait, that's the product we're supposed to find. Wait, is that right? Let me double-check.

Because if I have 10/x = 2y/5, then cross-multiplying gives 10*5 = 2y*x → 50 = 2xy → xy = 25. Yeah, that seems straightforward.

But wait, let me make sure there are no mistakes here. Sometimes when dealing with logs, especially changing the base, things can get tricky.

Wait, let's think about it another way. Let me express both equations in terms of natural logarithms to see if I can find a relationship between x and y.

So, log_x(y^x) = 10 → (ln(y^x))/(ln x) = 10 → (x ln y)/(ln x) = 10.  
Similarly, log_y(x^{4y}) = 10 → (ln(x^{4y}))/ln y =10 → (4y ln x)/ln y =10.

So now I have:

Equation (1): (x ln y)/(ln x) =10  
Equation (2): (4y ln x)/ln y =10

Let me denote ln x as a and ln y as b. Then, the equations become:

Equation (1): (x b)/a =10  
Equation (2): (4y a)/b =10

Also, since a = ln x and b = ln y, and x and y are both greater than 1, a and b are positive.

So, Equation (1): x b =10 a  
Equation (2): 4y a =10 b

So, from Equation (1): x = (10 a)/b  
From Equation (2): y = (10 b)/(4a) = (5 b)/(2 a)

So, x = (10a)/b and y = (5b)/(2a). Let's compute xy.

xy = [(10a)/b] * [(5b)/(2a)] = (10a *5b)/(b *2a) → The a and b terms cancel out. So, 50/(2) =25.

So, xy=25. So that's the same result as before. So, that seems to confirm it.

But wait, perhaps I should check if this satisfies the original equations. Let's suppose xy=25. Let's see if that's consistent.

But wait, maybe I can find the values of x and y to be thorough. Let's see.

From the first equation: x log_x(y) =10. Let me express this as log_x(y) =10/x.

Similarly, log_y(x) = 10/(4y).

But since log_x(y) =1/(log_y(x)), so:

10/x = 1/(10/(4y)) = (4y)/10 → 10/x = (4y)/10 → 100 =4xy → xy=25.

Same result. So, that aligns.

Alternatively, maybe I can solve for x and y explicitly.

Since we have xy=25, let's express y=25/x.

Substitute into the first equation: log_x(y^x) =10.

Which is log_x((25/x)^x) =10.

Simplify (25/x)^x = (25^x)/(x^x) → Which is the same as (25/x)^x.

So, log_x[(25/x)^x] =10. Using the power rule again, this is x * log_x(25/x) =10.

So, x * [log_x(25) - log_x(x)] =10.

Because log_b(a/c) = log_b a - log_b c.

So, log_x(25) - 1. Because log_x(x) =1.

So, x [log_x(25) -1 ] =10.

Hmm, let's see. Let me write this as x log_x(25) -x =10.

But x log_x(25) can be written as log_x(25^x) = log_x(25^x). Wait, maybe not helpful.

Alternatively, perhaps express log_x(25) in terms of natural logs.

log_x(25) = ln(25)/ln(x).

So, x * (ln(25)/ln(x)) -x =10.

Hmm, but not sure if that helps directly. Maybe we can set t = ln(x), then ln(25) is a constant.

Wait, perhaps another approach. Let me think.

We have y=25/x.

From the second original equation: log_y(x^{4y})=10.

Which is log_y(x^{4y})=10 → (4y) log_y(x) =10.

So, 4y log_y(x) =10.

But log_y(x) =1/(log_x(y)).

From the first original equation: log_x(y^x) =10 → x log_x(y)=10 → log_x(y)=10/x.

So, log_y(x) = x/10.

Substitute into the second equation: 4y * (x/10)=10 → (4y x)/10=10 → (4xy)/10=10.

But since xy=25, 4*25 /10 =10 → 100/10=10 →10=10. Which is consistent.

So, all these checks out.

Therefore, xy=25.


We are given that \(\log_x(y^x) = 10\) and \(\log_y(x^{4y}) = 10\). Using logarithm properties, we rewrite the equations as:

1. \(x \cdot \log_x(y) = 10\)
2. \(4y \cdot \log_y(x) = 10\)

Let \(A = \log_x(y)\). Then, \(\log_y(x) = \frac{1}{A}\). Substituting into the equations:

1. \(x \cdot A = 10 \quad \Rightarrow \quad A = \frac{10}{x}\)
2. \(4y \cdot \frac{1}{A} = 10 \quad \Rightarrow \quad A = \frac{2y}{5}\)

Equating the two expressions for \(A\):

\[
\frac{10}{x} = \frac{2y}{5}
\]

Cross-multiplying gives:

\[
50 = 2xy \quad \Rightarrow \quad xy = 25
\]

Thus, the product \(xy\) is \(\boxed{25}\).
