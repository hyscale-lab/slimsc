Okay, so I've got this complex number problem to solve. The question is asking for the largest possible real part of the expression \[(75 + 117i)z + \frac{96 + 144i}{z}\], where \( z \) is a complex number with \( |z| = 4 \). Hmm, let me break this down and think through it step by step.

First, I know that \( z \) is a complex number, so I can represent it as \( z = a + bi \), where \( a \) and \( b \) are real numbers. But since \( |z| = 4 \), that means \( a^2 + b^2 = 16 \). That could be useful later on.

The expression we're dealing with is \((75 + 117i)z + \frac{96 + 144i}{z}\). I need to find the largest real part of this expression. Let me denote the expression as \( E \), so:

\[ E = (75 + 117i)z + \frac{96 + 144i}{z} \]

I want to find \( \text{Re}(E) \), the real part of \( E \), and determine its maximum value.

Since \( z \) is a complex number with magnitude 4, it might be easier to express \( z \) in polar form. So, let me write \( z \) as \( 4e^{i\theta} \), where \( \theta \) is the argument of \( z \). This way, \( |z| = 4 \) is automatically satisfied.

So substituting \( z = 4e^{i\theta} \), the expression becomes:

\[ E = (75 + 117i) \cdot 4e^{i\theta} + \frac{96 + 144i}{4e^{i\theta}} \]

Simplify each term:

First term: \( (75 + 117i) \cdot 4e^{i\theta} \)
Multiply 75 and 117 by 4:
75 * 4 = 300
117 * 4 = 468
So that term becomes \( 300 + 468i \) multiplied by \( e^{i\theta} \).

Second term: \( \frac{96 + 144i}{4e^{i\theta}} \)
Divide numerator by 4:
96 /4 = 24
144/4 = 36
So that term is \( 24 + 36i \) multiplied by \( e^{-i\theta} \) because \( 1/e^{i\theta} = e^{-i\theta} \).

So now, \( E = (300 + 468i)e^{i\theta} + (24 + 36i)e^{-i\theta} \).

To find the real part of \( E \), I need to compute the real parts of each term and add them together.

Let me recall that for a complex number \( w = u + vi \), \( w e^{i\theta} = (u \cos\theta - v \sin\theta) + (u \sin\theta + v \cos\theta)i \). So the real part of \( w e^{i\theta} \) is \( u \cos\theta - v \sin\theta \).

Similarly, the real part of \( w e^{-i\theta} \) would be \( u \cos\theta + v \sin\theta \), since \( e^{-i\theta} = \cos\theta - i\sin\theta \).

So applying this to both terms:

First term: \( (300 + 468i)e^{i\theta} \)
Real part: \( 300 \cos\theta - 468 \sin\theta \)

Second term: \( (24 + 36i)e^{-i\theta} \)
Real part: \( 24 \cos\theta + 36 \sin\theta \)

So adding both real parts together:

\[ \text{Re}(E) = (300 \cos\theta - 468 \sin\theta) + (24 \cos\theta + 36 \sin\theta) \]

Combine like terms:

\( (300 + 24)\cos\theta + (-468 + 36)\sin\theta \)
Which simplifies to:

\( 324 \cos\theta - 432 \sin\theta \)

So now, the problem reduces to finding the maximum value of \( 324 \cos\theta - 432 \sin\theta \) as \( \theta \) varies over all real numbers.

This is an expression of the form \( A \cos\theta + B \sin\theta \), and I remember that the maximum value of such an expression is \( \sqrt{A^2 + B^2} \). Wait, actually, the maximum is \( \sqrt{A^2 + B^2} \), but in this case, it's \( 324 \cos\theta - 432 \sin\theta \). So A is 324, and B is -432. So the maximum would be \( \sqrt{324^2 + (-432)^2} \).

Let me compute that.

First, compute 324 squared.

324^2: Let's calculate 300^2 = 90,000; 24^2 = 576; and the cross term is 2*300*24 = 14,400. So 90,000 + 14,400 + 576 = 104,976.

Similarly, 432^2: 400^2 = 160,000; 32^2=1,024; cross term 2*400*32=25,600. So 160,000 + 25,600 + 1,024 = 186,624. But since it's (-432)^2, it's same as 432^2, which is 186,624.

Adding 104,976 and 186,624:

104,976 + 186,624 = 291,600.

So the square root of 291,600 is... Let me see. 540^2 is 291,600 because 500^2=250,000, 40^2=1,600, and 2*500*40=40,000. So 250,000 + 40,000 + 1,600 = 291,600. So sqrt(291,600) is 540.

So the maximum of \( 324 \cos\theta - 432 \sin\theta \) is 540.

Wait, but let me make sure. Because I remember the formula: the maximum of \( A \cos\theta + B \sin\theta \) is \( \sqrt{A^2 + B^2} \). So in this case, A is 324, B is -432, so yes, the maximum is sqrt(324² + (-432)²) = sqrt(104,976 + 186,624) = sqrt(291,600) = 540.

So that's the maximum real part of the expression E. So the answer is 540.

But wait, let me just double-check everything to make sure I didn't make a mistake.

First, expressing z in polar form with |z|=4 is correct, so z = 4e^{iθ}.

Then, substituting into E:

(75+117i)*4e^{iθ} + (96+144i)/(4e^{iθ})

Which is (300 + 468i)e^{iθ} + (24 + 36i)e^{-iθ}.

Calculating real parts:

For (300 + 468i)e^{iθ}, real part is 300 cosθ - 468 sinθ.

For (24 + 36i)e^{-iθ}, real part is 24 cosθ + 36 sinθ.

Adding them gives 3
