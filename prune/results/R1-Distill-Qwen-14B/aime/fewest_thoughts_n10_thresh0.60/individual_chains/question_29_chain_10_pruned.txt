Okay, I'm going to try to figure out this geometry problem. Let me read it again and make sure I understand all the parts.

So, we have two rectangles, ABCD and EFGH. The points D, E, C, F are collinear. That means they all lie on the same straight line. Also, the points A, D, H, G all lie on a circle. So, those four points are concyclic or lie on the same circumference. 

The given lengths are BC = 16, AB = 107, FG = 17, and EF = 184. We need to find the length of CE.

Hmm, okay. Let me try to visualize this. I think drawing a diagram would really help, but since I can't draw, I'll try to imagine it.

First, let me note down the properties of the rectangles.

In rectangle ABCD, opposite sides are equal and all angles are 90 degrees. So, AB = CD = 107, and BC = AD = 16. Similarly, in rectangle EFGH, EF = GH = 184, and FG = EH = 17.

Wait, wait, no. Wait, FG is one side, and EF is another. Wait, in rectangle EFGH, EF and FG are adjacent sides. So, EF = 184, FG = 17. So, the sides of EFGH are 184 and 17.

Wait, but in a rectangle, opposite sides are equal. So, if EF = 184, then GH = 184. And FG = 17, so EH = 17.

Okay, got it.

Now, the points D, E, C, F are collinear. That's an important piece of information. So, E is somewhere between D and C, and F is another point on that line. Wait, but the order could vary. Let me think.

Wait, C is a vertex of rectangle ABCD. Let me try to figure out the arrangement. Let me think about the positions.

Since ABCD is a rectangle, let's assign coordinates to the points to make it easier. Maybe coordinate geometry can help here.

Let me assign coordinate system.

Let me place point D at the origin (0,0). Since ABCD is a rectangle, let's have sides DA and DC along the axes.

So, point D is at (0,0). Since AD = BC = 16, and AB = CD = 107.

So, point A would be at (0,16), point B at (107,16), and point C at (107,0).

Wait, no. Wait, if D is (0,0), then since AD is 16, and ABCD is a rectangle, if AB is 107, then yes.

Wait, actually, in a rectangle, adjacent sides are of different lengths. So, if ABCD is a rectangle with AB = 107 and BC = 16, then AB is the length and BC is the width.

So, the rectangle ABCD would have points:

- D at (0,0)
- C at (107,0)
- B at (107,16)
