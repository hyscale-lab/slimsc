Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the remainder when the product from k=0 to 12 of (2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k}) is divided by 1000. ω is a 13th root of unity and not equal to 1. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.

First, I remember that roots of unity have properties that might help here. Since ω is a primitive 13th root of unity, ω^13 = 1, and the minimal polynomial over the rationals is the 13th cyclotomic polynomial, which is Φ₁₃(x) = x¹² + x¹¹ + ... + x + 1. But I'm not sure if that's directly useful yet.

The product given is ∏_{k=0}^{12} (2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k}). Let's denote P = ∏_{k=0}^{12} (2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k}). I need to compute P mod 1000.

Wait, let me first consider what each term in the product looks like. For each k, the term is 2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k}. Maybe I can factor this expression or relate it to some polynomial evaluated at ω^k.

Let me try to rewrite the term. Let's denote z = ω^k. Then the term becomes 2 - 2z + z². So it's z² - 2z + 2. Hmm, that's a quadratic in z. Maybe I can factor it or find its roots.

Wait, the quadratic equation z² - 2z + 2 = 0. Let's compute the discriminant: D = (−2)^2 − 4*1*2 = 4 − 8 = −4. So the roots are z = [2 ± sqrt(-4)] / 2 = 1 ± i. So the roots are complex numbers 1 + i and 1 - i.

Therefore, z² - 2z + 2 = (z - (1 + i))(z - (1 - i)). So each term in the product is (ω^k - (1 + i))(ω^k - (1 - i)).

So P = ∏_{k=0}^{12} (ω^k - (1 + i))(ω^k - (1 - i)) = [∏_{k=0}^{12} (ω^k - (1 + i))] * [∏_{k=0}^{12} (ω^k - (1 - i))].

Now, I recall that for cyclotomic polynomials, the product of (x - ω^k) for k=0 to 12 is Φ₁₃(x) = x¹² + x¹¹ + ... + x + 1. But wait, actually, that product is equal to x¹³ - 1, because ω^k are the roots of x¹³ - 1 = 0. So ∏_{k=0}^{12} (x - ω^k) = x¹³ - 1.

So if I set x = (1 + i), then ∏_{k=0}^{12} ( (1 + i) - ω^k ) = (1 + i)^13 - 1. Similarly, ∏_{k=0}^{12} ( (1 - i) - ω^k ) = (1 - i)^13 - 1.

Therefore, P = [ (1 + i)^13 - 1 ] * [ (1 - i)^13 - 1 ].

So now, I need to compute (1 + i)^13 and (1 - i)^13, subtract 1 from each, multiply them together, and then take the result modulo 1000.

Hmm, let's compute (1 + i)^13 first. I know that 1 + i can be expressed in polar form. The modulus is √(1² + 1²) = √2, and the argument is π/4. So 1 + i = √2 e^{iπ/4}.

Therefore, (1 + i)^13 = (√2)^13 e^{i * 13 * π/4}.

Similarly, (1 - i) is √2 e^{-iπ/4}, so (1 - i)^13 = (√2)^13 e^{-i * 13 * π/4}.

Let me compute (√2)^13. That is (2)^{13/2} = 2^6 * √2 = 64 * √2 ≈ 90.5097. But let's keep it exact for now.

Now, let's compute the exponents:

For (1 + i)^13: e^{i * 13π/4} = e^{i*(3π + π/4)} = e^{iπ/4} * e^{i3π} = e^{iπ/4}*(-1). Because e^{i3π} = e^{iπ} = -1. Wait, wait, 13π/4 is equal to 3π + π/4. Let me compute 13π/4 modulo 2π.

13π/4 divided by 2π is (13/4)/2 = 13/8 = 1.625. So, 13π/4 = 2π * 1 + 5π/4. So 5π/4
