Okay, so I've got this geometry problem here. It's about triangle ABC with circumcenter O and incenter I. The problem states that IA is perpendicular to OI, the circumradius is 13, and the inradius is 6. I need to find AB multiplied by AC. Hmm, alright, let's try to figure this out step by step.

First, let me recall some basic properties of a triangle's circumcenter and incenter. The circumcenter O is the center of the circumscribed circle around the triangle, and it's the intersection of the perpendicular bisectors of the sides. The incenter I is the center of the inscribed circle, and it's the intersection of the angle bisectors.

Given that IA is perpendicular to OI. That's an interesting condition. I need to visualize this. Maybe drawing a rough sketch would help. Let me imagine triangle ABC, with O somewhere outside or inside the triangle depending on whether it's acute or obtuse. Since the circumradius is 13, which is a positive value, and the inradius is 6, which is also positive, the triangle is definitely not degenerate.

Wait, the inradius is 6, so the area can be expressed as r times s, where s is the semiperimeter. And the circumradius R is 13, which relates to the sides through the formula R = (a*b*c)/(4*Δ), where Δ is the area of the triangle.

Since IA is perpendicular to OI, maybe I can use some coordinate geometry here. Let me try to set up a coordinate system where point I is at the origin. That might simplify things because then OI would just be a vector from the origin to point O, and IA would be a vector from I to A, which is just the position vector of A.

If I place I at the origin, then O has coordinates (h, k), and A has coordinates (x, y). The condition IA perpendicular to OI can be written as the dot product of vectors IA and OI being zero.

Vector IA is (x, y) because I is at the origin. Vector OI is (h, k) because it goes from I (0,0) to O (h,k). So the dot product is x*h + y*k = 0.

So, that gives me xh + yk = 0.

But wait, I don't know where A is located in this coordinate system. Maybe I need a different approach.

Alternatively, perhaps using vector properties or coordinate geometry might complicate things. Maybe I should recall some formulas that relate R, r, and other triangle quantities.

I remember that in any triangle, the distance between the incenter and circumcenter is given by the formula:

OI² = R(R - 2r)

Wait, is that right? Let me check. Yes, Euler's formula states that OI² = R² - 2Rr. So substituting the given R and r, let's compute OI.

Given R = 13 and r = 6, OI² = 13² - 2*13*6 = 169 - 156 = 13. So OI is sqrt(13).

Wait, but the problem says IA is perpendicular to OI. Hmm, so IA is perpendicular to OI. So that means that in triangle OIA, angle at I is 90 degrees. So triangle OIA is right-angled at I.

Therefore, by Pythagoras' theorem, OA² = OI² + IA².

But wait, OA is just the circumradius, R, which is 13. So OA² = 13² = 169.

We know OI² is 13, as we calculated from Euler's formula. So IA² = OA² - OI² = 169 - 13 = 156.

So IA is sqrt(156). Simplify that, 156 is 4*39, so sqrt(4*39)=2*sqrt(39). So IA = 2√39.

Wait, IA is the length from inradius center I to vertex A. So IA is the distance from I to A, which is sqrt(156) or 2√39. Hmm.

Now, I recall that in a triangle, the distance from the inradius to a vertex can be expressed in terms of the triangle's sides and angles. Let's see.

From the inradius I to vertex A, the distance IA can be expressed as:

IA = √[ (r^2 + (s - a)^2 ) ]

Wait, is that correct? Let me think. Alternatively, maybe using trigonometric formulas. The distance from the inradius to a vertex can be given by IA = (r)/(sin(A/2)), but wait, let me confirm.

Wait, maybe we can use the formula for
