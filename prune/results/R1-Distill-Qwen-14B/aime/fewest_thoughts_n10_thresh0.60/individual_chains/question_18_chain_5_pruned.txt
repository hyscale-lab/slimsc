Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the number of rectangles that can be formed inside a regular dodecagon, which is a 12-sided polygon. Each side of the rectangle has to lie either on a side or a diagonal of the dodecagon. Hmm, that's interesting. I remember that in regular polygons, especially those with many sides, there are a lot of diagonals, so the number of possible rectangles might be quite high. But I need to figure out a systematic way to count them.

First, I should visualize a regular dodecagon. It has 12 sides, all equal in length, and all internal angles equal. Each internal angle in a regular dodecagon is 150 degrees, but I'm not sure if that fact will help here. Maybe not directly, but it's good to note.

Now, the problem is about rectangles, which are four-sided figures with right angles. So, to form a rectangle inside the dodecagon, I need four points (vertices) such that the lines connecting them form right angles. Each side of the rectangle must lie on a side or a diagonal of the dodecagon.

Wait, so each rectangle is determined by four vertices of the dodecagon, right? Because the sides of the rectangle must align with the sides or diagonals of the polygon. So, I might need to count all possible sets of four points that form rectangles under these constraints.

But how do I systematically find all such rectangles? Maybe I can think about the symmetry of the dodecagon. Since it's regular, it's highly symmetric, so perhaps rectangles are formed by selecting pairs of points that are symmetric with respect to the center.

Alternatively, maybe I should think about the diagonals of the dodecagon. In a regular polygon, diagonals can be classified by the number of sides they skip. For a dodecagon, the diagonals can be of different lengths depending on how many vertices they skip.

Wait, in a regular polygon, if you connect every k-th vertex, you get a diagonal. So, in a dodecagon, the possible diagonals are those that connect vertices with a step of 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6. But stepping 6 would actually be a diameter, right? Because 12 divided by 2 is 6. So, stepping 6 vertices would give the longest diagonal, passing through the center
