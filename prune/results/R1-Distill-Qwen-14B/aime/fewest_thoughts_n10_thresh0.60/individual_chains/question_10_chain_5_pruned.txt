Okay, so I'm trying to solve this math problem where Alice chooses a set A of positive integers. Then Bob lists all finite nonempty sets B of positive integers such that the maximum element of B is in A. It's given that Bob's list has 2024 sets, and I need to find the sum of the elements in A.

Hmm, let me break this down. First, I need to understand what exactly is going on here. Alice picks some set A, and based on that, Bob creates a list of all finite non-empty sets B where the maximum element of B is in A. So, for each B, max(B) is in A. And the number of such sets B is 2024.

I think the key is to figure out how the size of A relates to the number of possible sets B. Maybe if I can find out how many elements are in A, I can then figure out what those elements are and sum them up.

Wait, let's think about how Bob constructs his list. For each element a in A, Bob can create sets B where the maximum element is a. So, for each a, the number of such sets B would be the number of subsets of the positive integers that have a as their maximum. Because a is the maximum, all other elements in B must be less than a.

So, for a given a, how many such subsets are there? Well, the other elements can be any combination of the positive integers less than a. But wait, since the elements are positive integers, the numbers less than a are 1, 2, ..., a-1. Each of these can either be in B or not, except that B must be non-empty. But wait, no, because the maximum is a, and B must be non-empty. So, for each a, the number of possible B's with maximum a is equal to the number of non-empty subsets of {1, 2, ..., a-1}, each combined with the element a. Because B has to include a, and can include any combination of the smaller numbers.

Wait, no—that's not quite right. Because B can include a and any subset of {1, 2, ..., a-1}, including the empty set. But wait, B must be non-empty. So, including a and any subset of {1, 2, ..., a-1}, but since a is included, the subset can be empty. Because if you include a and nothing else, that's a valid set B.

Ah, right. So for each a, the number of sets B with max a is equal to 2^{a-1}. Because each element less than a can be either included or not, giving two choices for each, so 2^{a-1} subsets. Including the empty subset, which when combined with a gives {a}, the singleton set.

So, if A has elements a1, a2, ..., an, then the total number of sets B is the sum over each a in A of 2^{a-1}.

So, Bob's total number of sets is Σ_{a ∈ A} 2^{a-1} = 2024.

So, our equation is Σ (2^{a - 1}) for a in A equals 2024.

We need to find a set A such that when we sum 2^{a - 1} for each a in A, we get 2024. Then, once we have A, we sum its elements.

So, the problem reduces to finding a set A of positive integers where the sum of 2^{a-1} for a in A is 2024, and then find the sum of the elements in A.

Hmm. So, I need to find a collection of numbers a1, a2, ..., ak such that 2^{a1 -1} + 2^{a2 -1} + ... + 2^{ak -1} = 2024.

Wait, 2024 is a specific number. Maybe
