Okay, so I've got this math problem here about residents in Aimeville and the things they own. Hmm, let me read it again carefully.

Alright, so there are 900 residents total. Each of them owns a bag of candy hearts. That's a given. Then there are three other items: diamond rings, golf clubs, and garden spades. The numbers are 195 own a diamond ring, 367 own golf clubs, and 562 own a garden spade. Interesting, so those are the numbers for each individual item.

Now, the problem says that 437 residents own exactly two of these things, and 234 own exactly three. And I need to find how many own all four—so that's the candy hearts plus the other three items. Wait, no, actually, the candy hearts are already included in all of them, right? Or is it that the other three are separate, and the candy hearts are universal? Let me check the problem again.

Ah, yes: "each of the 900 residents owns a bag of candy hearts." So candy hearts are owned by everyone. The other three items—diamond rings, golf clubs, garden spades—are additional. So the four things are: candy hearts (which everyone has), plus the three others. So, the problem is about four items, but candy hearts are already accounted for in everyone. So when they talk about residents owning diamond rings, golf clubs, or garden spades, those are in addition to the candy hearts.

Wait, but the problem asks for the number of residents who own all four things. So that would be the residents who have the candy hearts (which everyone does), plus all three of the other items. So, I'm looking for the number of people who own all three of the other items as well as the candy hearts.

So, to model this, I think I should use the principle of inclusion-exclusion. I remember that when dealing with overlapping sets, inclusion-exclusion is the way to go. Let me recall the formula.

For four sets, the inclusion-exclusion principle is a bit involved, but maybe I can think of it in terms of the three other items. Since candy hearts are universal, maybe it's simpler.

Wait, no. Let me think again. Let me denote the sets:

Let A be the set of people who own a diamond ring.

Let B be those who own a
