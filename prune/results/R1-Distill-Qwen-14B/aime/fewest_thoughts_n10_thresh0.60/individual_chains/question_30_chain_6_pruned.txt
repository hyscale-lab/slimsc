Okay, so I've got this problem here that says: Let ω ≠ 1 be a 13th root of unity. Find the remainder when the product from k=0 to 12 of (2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k}) is divided by 1000. Hmm, that's a mouthful, but let's try to break it down.

First, I remember that roots of unity are complex numbers that satisfy ω^n = 1 for some integer n. Here, ω is a 13th root, so ω^13 = 1, and ω ≠ 1. That means ω is a primitive 13th root of unity, right? So, all the powers of ω from ω^0 up to ω^12 are distinct and lie on the unit circle in the complex plane.

The problem is asking for the product of terms of the form (2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k}) for k from 0 to 12. I need to compute this product modulo 1000. That means after computing the entire product, I have to find the remainder when it's divided by 1000.

Let me write out the product expression more clearly:

P = ∏_{k=0}^{12} (2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k})

Hmm, okay. Let me see if I can factor this expression or find a pattern or something. Since ω is a root of unity, maybe I can relate this to a polynomial with roots at these ω^k's.

Wait, I remember that for cyclotomic polynomials, the minimal polynomial for primitive roots of unity. But not sure if that's directly applicable here.

Alternatively, perhaps I can consider each term (2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k}) and see if it can be expressed as a product involving ω^k and some other terms.

Let me try to factor each term. Let's look at (2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k}). Maybe factor out something or rearrange terms.

Hmm, 2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k} can be written as ω^{2k} - 2ω^k + 2. Maybe that helps. Let me think about whether this is a quadratic in ω^k.

Yes! Let's consider t = ω^k. Then the term becomes t^2 - 2t + 2. So each term is a quadratic in t. So, the product P is the product over k=0 to 12 of (t^2 - 2t + 2), where t = ω^k.

But wait, since ω is a primitive 13th root, as k runs from 0 to 12, t = ω^k will take each of the 13th roots of unity, except that when k=0, ω^0 = 1. So, we have to be careful about that term.

Wait, for k=0, ω^0 = 1, so the term is (1)^2 - 2(1) +
