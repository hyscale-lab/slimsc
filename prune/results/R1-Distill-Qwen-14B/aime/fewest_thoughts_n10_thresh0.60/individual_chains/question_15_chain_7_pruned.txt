Okay, so I've got this problem about counting paths on an 8x8 grid. The paths go from the lower left corner to the upper right corner, have a length of 16, and they change direction exactly four times. Hmm, I need to figure out how to approach this.

First, let me visualize the grid. An 8x8 grid has lines that form squares, right? So, moving from the lower left to the upper right would involve moving right and up. Each step is either right or up, and the total number of steps is 16 because you have to move 8 steps right and 8 steps up. So the total number of paths without any restrictions would be the combination of 16 steps taken 8 at a time, which is C(16,8). But that's without considering direction changes.

Wait, but the problem isn't about the number of steps, but about the number of direction changes. So a path that changes direction exactly four times. Hmm, what does that mean?

Each time the path changes direction, it switches from moving right to up or up to right. So, for example, if a path starts by moving right, then changes direction once to move up, then again to right, etc. Each direction change is a switch between right and up.

So, in total, how many segments are there in the path? Each direction change increases the number of segments by one. Starting with one segment, each change adds another. So four direction changes would create five segments. But wait, let's think. If you have four direction changes, the number of segments is five? Let me check: starting direction, then each change adds a new segment. So yes, four changes make five segments.

Each segment is a straight line either to the right or up. So, for example, a path might go right for a while, then up, then right, up, right, up, right. That would be four direction changes, making five segments.

Now, in an 8x8 grid, the total right moves are 8 and the total up moves are 8. So each path is a sequence of right and up moves adding up to 8 each.

Each segment consists of consecutive right or up moves. So, if we have five segments, each segment is either right or up, and the sum of all right segments must be 8, and the sum of all up segments must be 8.

Also,
