Okay, so I've got this problem about counting paths on an 8x8 grid. The paths go from the lower left corner to the upper right corner, have a length of 16, and change direction exactly four times. Hmm, I need to figure out how to approach this.

First, let me make sure I understand the problem correctly. On an 8x8 grid, moving from the lower left to the upper right corner, each path has exactly 16 steps—right? Because from (0,0) to (8,8), you need 8 right and 8 up moves, totaling 16 steps. So each path is a sequence of 8 rights (R) and 8 ups (U), arranged in some order.

Now, the key part is that the path changes direction exactly four times. Hmm, changing direction... So, a direction change happens when you switch from moving right to up or from up to right. For example, if you go RRUURRUU, that's changing direction twice: from RR to UU, then UU to RR, then RR to UU again. Wait, no, let me count. Let's see: starting with R, then switching to U (that's one change), then back to R (second change), then back to U (third change). So in that 8-step path, there are three direction changes. Wait, but that's a shorter path. So maybe in a longer path, each switch counts as a change.

Wait, but in our case, the path is 16 steps long, so there are 15 direction change points. Each time the direction changes, it's a switch from R to U or U to R. So, the number of direction changes is the number of times the direction switches from one to the other.

So, if a path changes direction exactly four times, that means it alternates between R and U four times. So, for example, starting with R, then U, then R, then U, then R—so four changes. Or starting with U, then R, then U, then R, then U—so four changes. So the path is divided into segments where each segment is either all R's or all U's, and the number of such segments is one more than the number of direction changes.

Wait, that's important. If a path changes direction k times, then the number of segments is k+1. So, for four direction changes, there are five segments. Each segment is a consecutive sequence of R's or U's.

So, for our problem, each path is composed of five segments, alternating between R and U, starting with either R or U. So each path can start with R or U, and each subsequent segment alternates.

So, first, I need to figure out how many such paths there are, breaking down into these segments.

Now, since we have five segments and four direction changes, the path alternates between R and U. So, the path could be R, U, R, U, R or U, R, U, R, U. So, two possibilities for the starting direction.

Let me consider both cases separately.

Case 1: Starting with R, then U, then R, then U, then R.

Case 2: Starting with U, then R, then U, then R, then U.

So, for each case, I need to figure out how to distribute the number of steps in each segment.

Each segment must have at least one step, right? Because a direction can't be taken zero times; otherwise, it wouldn't be a segment. So, each segment must have at least one move.

So, for Case 1: starting with R, then U, then R, then U, then R.

We have five segments: R, U, R, U, R. So, the counts for each R segment (there are three R segments) and each U segment (two U segments) must be at least 1.

Similarly, for Case 2: starting with U, then R, then U, then R, then U. So, three U segments and two R segments.

Wait, no, let me think again. For a path that starts with R and has five segments, the pattern is R, U, R, U, R. So, the number of R segments is three, each requiring at least one R, and the number of U segments is two, each requiring at least one U.

Similarly, for the other case starting with U, you have three U segments and two R segments.

So, for each case, we can model the distribution of steps.

For Case 1: Starting with R, with five segments: R, U, R, U, R. So, the R segments (positions 1,3,5) each have at least one R, and the U segments (positions 2,4) each have at least one U.

Similarly for Case 2.

So, let's formalize this.

In Case 1:

Let the number of R's in each R segment be r1, r3, r5, each at least 1, and the number of U's in each U segment be u2, u4, each at least 1.

Similarly, the total number of R's is r1 + r3 + r5 = 8.

And the total number of U's is u2 + u4 = 8.

Similarly, for Case 2:

Each U segment (positions 1,3,5) has u1, u3, u5, each at least 1.

Each R segment (positions 2,4) has r2, r4, each at least 1.

Total U's: u1 + u3 + u5 = 8.

Total R's: r2 + r4 = 8.

So, for each case, we can compute the number of ways to distribute the steps.

Let's handle Case 1 first.

Case 1: Starting with R.

We have three R segments (r1, r3, r5) each at least 1, summing to 8.

Similarly, two U segments (u2, u4) each at least 1, summing to 8.

The number of ways to distribute the R's is the number of integer solutions to r1 + r3 + r5 = 8, with each ri ≥ 1.

Similarly, for U's: u2 + u4 = 8, each ≥1.

The number of solutions for R's is C(8-1,3-1) = C(7,2) = 21.

Similarly, for U's: C(8-1,2-1) = C(7,1) =7.

So, the number of ways for Case 1 is 21 * 7 = 147.

Similarly, for Case 2: Starting with U.

Three U segments: u1, u3, u5 ≥1, summing to 8.

Two R segments: r2, r4 ≥1, summing to 8.

Number of ways for U's: C(8-1,3-1)=C(7,2)=21.

Number of ways for R's: C(8-1,2-1)=C(7,1)=7.

So, number of ways for Case 2 is also 21*7=147.

So, total number of paths is 147 (Okay, so I have this problem about counting the number of paths on an 8x8 grid. The paths start from the lower left corner and go to the upper right corner, and they have a length of 16. Each path changes direction exactly four times. Hmm, interesting.

First, I need to visualize the grid. An 8x8 grid has 8 rows and 8 columns, so moving from the lower left to the upper right would require moving 8 steps up and 8 steps to the right. The total number of steps is 16, which makes sense because the problem mentions paths of length 16.

Now, the key here is that the path changes direction exactly four times. So, I should think about what that means. In a grid, a path can either move right or up. Each time the direction changes, it switches from right to up or up to right.

So, without any direction changes, the path would be a straight line, but in this case, since it's a grid, the only way to move from the start to the end is by alternating between right and up moves, but that's not necessarily the case. Wait, actually, the maximum number of direction changes would be 15, I think, because each step after the first could potentially change direction. But we're only allowing four changes.

Hmm, okay, so each time the direction changes, it's like adding a new segment to the path. So, if you have four direction changes, how many segments does that make? Let me think. Each direction change splits the path into a new segment. So, starting with the first segment, each direction change adds
