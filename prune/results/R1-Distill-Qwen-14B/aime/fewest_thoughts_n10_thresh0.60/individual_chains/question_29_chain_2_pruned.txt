Okay, so I'm trying to solve this geometry problem, and I need to figure out the length of CE. Let me try to visualize the problem first because not having a diagram might make it a bit tricky, but maybe I can sketch a rough one in my mind.

We have two rectangles, ABCD and EFGH. The points D, E, C, F are collinear, which means they all lie on a straight line. Also, the points A, D, H, G all lie on a circle. Hmm, that's interesting. So, A, D, H, G are concyclic or lie on the same circle, which might mean something about cyclic quadrilaterals.

Given lengths: BC = 16, AB = 107, FG = 17, and EF = 184. We need to find CE.

First, since ABCD is a rectangle, opposite sides are equal, so BC = AD = 16, and AB = CD = 107. Similarly, since EFGH is a rectangle, EF = GH = 184, and FG = EH = 17.

Wait, but in a rectangle, opposite sides are equal and all angles are 90 degrees. So, ABCD has AB and CD as length 107, and BC and AD as 16. Similarly, EFGH has EF and GH as 184, and FG and EH as 17.

Now, the points D, E, C, F are collinear. Let me try to imagine this. So, let's assume that the line is horizontal. Let me assign coordinates to make this easier. Maybe coordinate geometry will help here.

Let me place point D at the origin (0, 0) for simplicity. Then, since ABCD is a rectangle, and AD is 16, point A would be at (0, 16). Then, since AB is 107, point B would be at (107, 16), and point C would be at (107, 0).

Now, E, F, D, C are collinear. Since D is at (0, 0) and C is at (107, 0), the line is the x-axis. So, E and F must lie somewhere on the x-axis.

But EFGH is another rectangle. Let me think about where E and F could be on the x-axis. Let me denote E as (e, 0) and F as (f, 0). Since E and F are on the x-axis, their y-coordinates are zero.

Now, EFGH is a rectangle. So, from point F, we can go upwards to point G, and from E, we can go upwards to point H. Since FG = 17, and EF = 184, the sides of the rectangle EFGH are 17 and 184. Wait, so EF is the length 184, and FG is 17. So, the rectangle is 184 units long and 17 units tall.

But wait, if EF is 184, then the distance between E and F is 184. Since E and F are on the x-axis, |f - e| = 1
