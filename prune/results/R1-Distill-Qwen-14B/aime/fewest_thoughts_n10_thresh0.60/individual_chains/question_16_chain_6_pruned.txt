Okay, so I have this math problem to solve. Let me read it again and make sure I understand what it's asking.

The problem says: Let p be the least prime number for which there exists a positive integer n such that n⁴ + 1 is divisible by p². Then, I need to find the least positive integer m such that m⁴ + 1 is divisible by p².

Hmm. So, first, I need to find the smallest prime p where p² divides some n⁴ + 1. Then, once I find that p, find the smallest m where m⁴ + 1 is divisible by p².

I think I remember that for primes p, if p divides n⁴ + 1, then p must be congruent to 1 mod 8. Because n⁴ ≡ -1 mod p, so squaring both sides gives n^8 ≡ 1 mod p, which implies that the order of n modulo p is 8. So, by Fermat's little theorem, 8 must divide p-1, so p ≡ 1 mod 8.

Wait, but here we're dealing with p² dividing n⁴ + 1, not just p. So maybe p can be such that it's 1 mod 8, but perhaps also primes where something else holds?

Alternatively, maybe I should check small primes first to see which is the smallest prime p where p² divides n⁴ +1 for some n.

Let me list the primes in order: 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, etc.

I'll check each prime p and see if p² divides n⁴ +1 for some n.

Starting with p=2: 2²=4. Let's see if 4 divides n⁴ +1. n can be 1: 1+1=2, not divisible by 4. n=2: 16+1=17, which mod 4 is 1. 17 mod4=1, so 4 doesn't divide 17. n=3: 81+1=82, which mod4 is 2. n=4: 256+1=257 mod4=1. So it seems that for p=2, 4 never divides n⁴ +1. So p=2 is out.

Next, p=3: p²=9. Let's check if 9 divides n⁴ +1 for some n.

Let me compute n⁴ mod9 for n=1 to 8 (since mod9 cycles every 9 numbers, but n^4 is periodic).

n=1: 1+1=2 mod9 → 2, no.
n=2: 16+1=17 mod9=8, no.
n=3: 81+1=82 mod9=1, since 81 is 0 mod9, so 1. No.
n=4: 256 mod9: 256 divided by 9 is 28*9=252, 256-252=4. So 4 +1=5 mod9, no.
n=5: 5^4=625. 625 divided by 9: 9*69=621, 625-621=4. So 4 +1=5 mod9, no.
n=6: 6^4=1296. 1296 is 0 mod9. 0+1=1 mod9. No.
n=7: 7^4=2401. 2401 mod9: 2+4+0+1=7, and 7 mod9=7. So
