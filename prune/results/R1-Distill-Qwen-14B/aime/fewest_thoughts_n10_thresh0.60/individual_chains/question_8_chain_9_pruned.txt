Okay, so I've got this problem here. It says I need to find the number of triples of nonnegative integers (a, b, c) such that a + b + c = 300 and another equation involving a, b, c: a²b + a²c + b²a + b²c + c²a + c²b = 6,000,000. That looks a bit complicated, but maybe I can simplify it.

First, let's write down what's given. We have two equations:

1. a + b + c = 300
2. a²b + a²c + b²a + b²c + c²a + c²b = 6,000,000

I need to find all nonnegative integer triples (a, b, c) that satisfy both.

Hmm, the second equation seems symmetric in a, b, c. Maybe I can factor it somehow or express it in terms of symmetric functions. Let me see.

Looking at the second equation, I notice that each term is a product of two variables where one is squared. So, for example, a²b and a²c can be factored as a²(b + c). Similarly, b²a + b²c = b²(a + c), and c²a + c²b = c²(a + b). So if I group them that way:

a²(b + c) + b²(a + c) + c²(a + b) = 6,000,000.

That's a bit cleaner. Now, from the first equation, a + b + c = 300, so I can express (b + c), (a + c), and (a + b) in terms of the other variables.

Specifically:
- (b + c) = 300 - a
- (a + c) = 300 - b
- (a + b) = 300 - c

So substituting these into the second equation:

a²(300 - a) + b²(300 - b) + c²(300 - c) = 6,000,000.

Hmm, that's a helpful substitution. Let me write that down as:

a²(300 - a) + b²(300 - b) + c²(300 - c) = 6,000,000.

Now, this expression is also symmetric in a, b, c. So maybe I can find some pattern or perhaps find a way to relate this to the sum a + b + c.

Let me compute each term individually. Let's take a²(300 - a) = 300a² - a³. Similarly, each term will be 300b² - b³ and 300c² - c³. So the entire sum is:

300a² - a³ + 300b² - b³ + 300c² - c³ = 6,000,000.

I can factor out the 300:

300(a² + b² + c²) - (a³ + b³ + c³) = 6,000,000.

So, 300(a² + b² + c²) - (a³ + b³ + c³) = 6,000,000.

Hmm. I wonder if I can express a³ + b³ + c³ in terms of a + b + c and other symmetric sums. I remember that:

a³ + b³ + c³ = (a + b + c)^3 - 3(a + b + c)(ab + bc + ca) + 3abc.

Given that a + b + c = 300, let's denote S = a + b + c = 300, P = ab + bc + ca, and Q = abc.

Then, a³ + b³ + c³ = S³ - 3SP + 3Q.

So, substituting back into the equation:

300(a² + b² + c²) - [S³ - 3SP + 3Q] = 6,000,000.

But we also know that a² + b² + c² = (a + b + c)^2 - 2(ab + bc + ca) = S² - 2P.

So, substituting this in:

300(S² - 2P) - [S³ - 3SP + 3Q] = 6,000,000.

Let me plug in S = 300:

300(300² - 2P) - [300³ - 3*300*P + 3Q] = 6,000,000.

Compute 300²: 90,000.

So, 300*(90,000 - 2P) = 300*90,000 - 300*2P = 27,000,000 - 600P.

Then, the second part is:

300³ = 27,000,000.

3*300*P = 900P.

So, the second term inside the brackets is [27,000,000 - 900P + 3Q].

Putting it all together:

27,000,000 - 600P - (27,000,000 - 900P + 3Q) = 6,000,000.

Let's distribute the negative sign:

27,000,000 - 600P -27,000,000 + 900P - 3Q = 6,000,000.

Simplify:

(27,000,000 -27,000,000) cancels out.

(-600P + 900P) = 300P.

So, 300P - 3Q = 6,000,000.

Divide both sides by 3:

100P - Q = 2,000,000.

So, 100P - Q = 2,000,000. Let's note this as equation (1).

Now, our unknowns are P and Q, the symmetric sums ab + bc + ca and abc.

We have equation (1): 100P - Q = 2,000,000.

But we also have another equation from S = 300 and the definition of P and Q.

Wait, so in the original variables, we have S = 300, and we have equation (1): 100P - Q = 2,000,000.

We need another equation to relate P and Q. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps we can find another relation. Let's think. We have S = a + b + c = 300, and we can also think about the number of triples (a, b, c). But I'm not sure if that directly helps.

Alternatively, perhaps we can express Q in terms of P from equation (1):

From equation (1): Q = 100P - 2,000,000.

So, Q = 100P - 2,000,000.

Now, since a, b, c are nonnegative integers, P and Q must also be integers, and Q must be nonnegative as well because it's a product of nonnegative integers.

Wait, but Q can be zero if any of a, b, c is zero. So, if Q = 100P - 2,000,0
