Okay, so I've got this geometry problem here, and I'm trying to figure out how to approach it. Let me read it again to make sure I understand.

We have two rectangles, ABCD and EFGH. The points D, E, C, F are collinear. Also, the points A, D, H, G all lie on a circle. Given lengths are BC=16, AB=107, FG=17, and EF=184. We need to find the length of CE.

Hmm, okay. So, first, I'll try to visualize this setup. Two rectangles, with some points lying on a circle. Since ABCD and EFGH are rectangles, all their angles are right angles, and opposite sides are equal.

Let me draw a rough sketch in my mind. Rectangle ABCD: let's say it's positioned with AB as the base, BC as the height, so AB=107, BC=16. That makes it a tall, narrow rectangle. Then, rectangle EFGH is another rectangle, and D, E, C, F are collinear. So, points D, E, C, F lie on a straight line.

Also, points A, D, H, G lie on a circle. That's interesting. So, these four points form a cyclic quadrilateral. Maybe that can help us find some relationships between the sides or angles.

Given that, let's note down the given lengths:

- BC = 16 (so height of rectangle ABCD)
- AB = 107 (base of ABCD)
- FG = 17 (one side of EFGH)
- EF = 184 (another side of EFGH)

We need to find CE.

First, I think assigning coordinates to these points might help. Let me try to assign coordinates to each point to model this problem.

Let me place point D at the origin (0,0) for simplicity. Since ABCD is a rectangle, with BC=16 and AB=107, the coordinates of the other points can be determined.

If D is at (0,0), then since BC=16, point C would be at (0,16). Then, because AB=107, point B would be at (107,16). Point A would then be at (107,0). Wait, no, hold on. Because in a rectangle, moving from D to C is one side, and from D to A is another. Wait, maybe I should define the rectangle more carefully.

Wait, in rectangle ABCD, the sides are AB, BC, CD, DA. So, starting at A, moving to B, then to C, then to D, and back to A. So, if ABCD is a rectangle, and BC=16, AB=107, then AB is the base, BC is the height.

So, if I place point A at (0,0), then point B would be at (107,0), point C at (107,16), and point D at (0,16). Hmm, that makes more sense. Because then AB is the base, BC is the vertical side. So, yes, that seems right.

Now, rectangle EFGH. Points D, E,
