Okay, so I have this math problem here: I need to find the least prime number p such that there exists a positive integer n where n⁴ + 1 is divisible by p². Then, I have to find the least positive integer m such that m⁴ + 1 is divisible by p². Hmm, seems a bit tricky, but let me try to break it down.

First, I think I should start by understanding what the problem is asking. It's about primes p where p² divides n⁴ + 1 for some n. So, for these primes, n⁴ ≡ -1 mod p². I remember that for primes, especially for primes where -1 is a quadratic residue, but here it's a quartic residue.

Wait, maybe I should recall that if a number is a quadratic residue modulo p, then it's a quadratic residue modulo p² under certain conditions. But this is about quartic residues. So, maybe I should think about primes where the equation x⁴ ≡ -1 mod p² has a solution.

I think the first step is to find the smallest prime p where such an n exists. Let me list the small primes and check for each whether n⁴ +1 is divisible by p².

Starting with p=2: Let me see. For p=2, p²=4. So, n⁴ +1 mod 4. Let's test n=1: 1 +1 =2, which is 2 mod4, not divisible by 4. n=2: 16 +1=17, which is 1 mod4. n=3: 81 +1=82, which is 2 mod4. Hmm, so n=1,2,3 mod4, n⁴ is 1,0,1 respectively. So n⁴ +1 is 2,1,2 mod4. So it's only 2 mod4 when n is odd. So 2 mod4 isn't 0, so p=2 doesn't work because n⁴ +1 isn't divisible by 4 for any n.

Next prime, p=3. Let's compute n⁴ mod9. n can be 0 to 8 mod9. Let's compute n⁴ mod9 for n=0,1,...,8.

n=0: 0 mod9
n=1:1⁴=1 mod9
n=2:16 mod9=7
n=3:81 mod9=0
n=4: (4²=16 mod9=7, 7²=49 mod9=4)
n=5: (5²=25 mod9=7, 7²=49 mod9=4)
n=6:6⁴=(6²=36 mod9=0)
n=7: (7²=49 mod9=4, 4²=16 mod9=7)
n=8: (8²=64 mod9=1, 1²=1 mod9=1)

So n⁴ mod9 gives: 0,1,7,0,4,4,0,7,1. So n⁴ +1 mod9 would be 1,2,8,1,5,5,1,8,2. None of these are 0 mod9. So p=3 doesn't work either.

Next prime, p=5. Let's see if there's an n such that n⁴ ≡ -1 mod25. So, n⁴ ≡24 mod25. Let me compute n⁴ mod25 for n from 1 to 24.

But that's a lot, maybe I can find a smarter way. Let me see if 24 is a quartic residue mod25.

Alternatively, maybe I can note that for primes p ≡1 mod4, -1 is a quadratic residue. Wait, but here we have quartic residues. So perhaps if p ≡1 mod8, then -1 is a quartic residue?

Wait, I'm a bit fuzzy on quartic residues. Let's recall that the multiplicative group mod p² is cyclic of order p(p-1). So for p odd, the group is cyclic, so the number of solutions to x^k ≡ a mod p² depends on the gcd(k, φ(p²)).

Wait, φ(p²) = p(p-1). So for x^4 ≡ -1 mod p², the equation has a solution only if the order of -1 divides 4 in the multiplicative group.

Wait, the multiplicative group mod p² has order p(p-1). So to have x^4 ≡ -1, the order of -1 must divide 4. Let me think. The order of -1 in the multiplicative group mod p² is 2, since (-1)^2=1. So for x^4 to be -1, we must have that 4 is a multiple of the order of -1, which is 2, which it is. So perhaps that doesn't give a restriction.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use Hensel's lemma. If there's a solution mod p, then under certain conditions, it can be lifted to a solution mod p².

So, suppose that n⁴ ≡ -1 mod p has a solution. Then, maybe it can be lifted to a solution mod p².

So first, let's find primes p where x⁴ ≡ -1 mod p has a solution. Because if there is a solution mod p, and the derivative 4x³ is not congruent to 0 mod p at that solution, then Hensel's lemma says that it can be lifted to a solution mod p².

So, first, find primes p where x⁴ ≡ -1 mod p has a solution. Let's try small primes.

p=5: Let's compute possible n mod5.

n=1:1⁴=1 mod5
n=2:16=1 mod5
n=3:81=1 mod5
n=4:256=1 mod5
n=0:0.

So x⁴ ≡1 mod5 for any x. So x⁴ ≡-1 mod5 would be x⁴≡4 mod5. But from above, all x⁴ mod5 are 0 or 1. So 4 isn't achieved. So p=5 doesn't have a solution.

p=7: Let me compute x⁴ mod7 for x=1,2,3,4,5,6.

1⁴=1
2⁴=16=2 mod7
3⁴=81=4 mod7
4⁴=(4²=16=2, 2²=4) mod7=4
5⁴=(5²=25=4, 4²=16=2) mod7=2
6⁴= (6²=36=1, 1²=1) mod7=1.

So x⁴ mod7 can be 1, 2, or4. So x⁴ ≡-1 mod7 would be x⁴≡6 mod7. But 6 isn't achieved, so p=7 doesn't have a solution.

p=11: Let me try x=1 to 10 mod11.

1⁴=1
2⁴=16=5
3⁴=81=4
4⁴=256=3
5⁴=625=625-55*11=625-605=20=9
6⁴=1296: 1296/11=117*11=1287, 1296-1287=9, so 9 mod11
7⁴=(7²=49=5, 5²=25=3) mod11=3
8⁴=(8²=64=9, 9²=81=4) mod11=4
9⁴=(9²=81=4, 4²=16=5) mod11=5
10⁴=(10²=100=1, 1²=1) mod11=1.

So the quartic residues mod11 are 1,3,4,5,9. So x⁴ ≡-1 mod11 is x⁴≡10 mod11. But 10 isn't in the list, so no solution.

p=13: Let's compute x⁴ mod13 for x=1-12.

1⁴=1
2⁴=16=3
3⁴=81=3
4⁴=256=256-19*13=256-247=9
Wait, wait, 4²=16=3, 3²=9, so 4⁴=9 mod13.
5⁴: 5²=25=12, 12²=144=1 mod13
6⁴:6²=36=10, 10²=100=9 mod13
7⁴:7²=49=10, 10²=100=9 mod13
8⁴:8²=64=12, 12²=144=1 mod13
9⁴:9²=81=3, 3²=9 mod13
10⁴=10²=100=9, 9²=81=3 mod13
11⁴=11²=121=4, 4²=16=3 mod13
12⁴=12²=144=1, 1²=1 mod13.

So the quartic residues mod13 are 1,3,9. So x⁴ ≡-1 mod13 is x⁴≡12 mod13. But 12 isn't in the quartic residues, so no solution.

p=17: Let's compute x⁴ mod17.

1⁴=1
2⁴=16
3⁴=81=13
4⁴=256=1
5⁴=625=625-36*17=625-612=13
6⁴=1296=1296-76*17=1296-1292=4
7⁴=2401=2401-141*17=2401-2397=4
8⁴=4096=4096-241*17=4096-4097=-1=16 mod17
Wait, 8⁴=4096. Let me compute 8²=64 mod17: 64/17=3*17=51, 64-51=13. So 8²=13 mod17. Then 13²=169=169-10*17=169-170=-1=16 mod17. So 8⁴=16 mod17. So x⁴=16≡-1 mod17.

So yes, for p=17, x=8 mod17 is a solution to x⁴ ≡-1 mod17. So p=17 is a candidate. But is it the smallest?

Wait, I skipped p=13, which didn't have a solution. Next is p=17. Let me check p=11 again to make sure. Wait, p=11, x⁴ mod11 gives residues 1,3,4,5,9. So -1 is 10, which isn't there. So p=17 is the next prime after 13.

But wait, maybe I missed some primes? Let me see: after p=7, which didn't work, p=11,13,17. Wait, what about p=5? No, p=5 didn't have a solution. So p=17 is the smallest prime where x⁴ ≡-1 mod p has a solution. So p=17 is the first prime where n⁴ +1 is divisible by p.

But the problem says p is the least prime where there exists n such that n⁴ +1 is divisible by p². So even though p=17 works mod17, does it work mod17²=289?

Hmm, so I need to check whether the solution x=8 mod17 can be lifted to a solution mod289. Because if so, then p=17 is the prime we're looking for. If not, then we might need a larger prime.

To check whether x⁴ ≡-1 mod289 has a solution, I can use Hensel's lemma. But first, since x=8 is a solution mod17, I can try to find a solution mod289.

Let me set x = 8 + 17k, where k is an integer between 0 and 16. Then, compute x⁴ mod289 and see if it's ≡288 mod289 (since -1 mod289 is 288).

Compute x = 8 +17k.

First, compute x mod289. Let's compute x⁴: (8 +17k)^4. Maybe it's easier to compute (8 +17k)^4 mod289. Since 17^2=289, terms with (17k)^2 will be 0 mod289. So let me expand (8 +17k)^4 using the binomial theorem:

(8 +17k)^4 = 8^4 + 4*(8^3)*(17k) + 6*(8^2)*(17k)^2 + 4*(8)*(17k)^3 + (17k)^4.

Since we're mod289, any term with 17^2 or higher is 0. So, the expansion mod289 is:

8^4 + 4*(8^3)*(17k) mod289.

Compute 8^4: 8²=64, 64²=4096. 4096 mod289: Let's compute 289*14=4046, 4096-4046=50. So 8^4 ≡50 mod289.

Next, compute 4*(8^3)*(17k). 8^3=512. 512 mod289: 289*1=289, 512-289=223. So 8^3≡223 mod289.

So 4*(223)*(17k) = 4*223*17k. Let's compute 4*223=892. 892 mod289: 289*3=867, 892-867=25, so 892≡25 mod289. Then, 25*17=425. 425 mod289: 425-289=136. So 4*(8^3)*(17k) ≡136k mod289.

So putting it together, x⁴ ≡50 +136k mod289.

We want x⁴ ≡288 mod289. So set 50 +136k ≡288 mod289.

Subtract 50: 136k ≡238 mod289.

Simplify this equation: 136k ≡238 mod289.

We can write this as 136k ≡238 mod289. Let's compute the GCD of 136 and 289 to see if a solution exists.

136 divides into 289: 289=2*136 +17.

Then, 136=8*17 +0. So GCD is 17.

Since 17 divides 238? 238 ÷17=14. So yes, 17 divides 238, so the equation has solutions.

The general solution will be given by (136/17)k ≡ (238/17) mod (289/17).

Which simplifies to 8k ≡14 mod17.

So 8k ≡14 mod17.

Multiplicative inverse of 8 mod17: 8*2=16≡-1, so 8*(-2)=1 mod17. So inverse is -2=15 mod17.

Multiply both sides by 15: k ≡14*15 mod17.

14*15=210. 210 mod17: 17*12=204, 210-204=6. So k≡6 mod17.

So k=6 +17t, where t is an integer.

But since k is between 0 and 16 (as we're lifting mod289), k=6.

So x=8 +17*6=8+102=110.

So x=110 is a solution mod289. Let me check:

Compute 110⁴ mod289.

But 110 mod289 is 110, so let's compute 110²=12100. 12100 mod289: Let's compute how many times 289 goes into 12100.

289*41=289*40=11560 +289=11849. 12100-11849=251.

So 110²≡251 mod289.

Now, 251²: Let's compute 251²=63001. 63001 mod289.

Compute 289*217=289*(200+17)=289*200=57800; 289*17=4913. So 57800+4913=62713. 63001-62713=288.

So 251²=288 mod289. So 110⁴=(110²)²=251²=288≡-1 mod289.

Yes! So x=110 is a solution to x⁴ ≡-1 mod289. Therefore, p=17 is indeed the least prime where there exists n such that n⁴ +1 is divisible by p². So p=17.

Now, the second part is to find the least positive integer m such that m⁴ +1 is divisible by 17²=289. From above, x=110 is a solution, but 110 is quite large. Maybe there's a smaller m.

Wait, x=110 mod289. So the possible m's are 110, 110-289= -179, but we want positive integers, so m=110 is the smallest positive solution. But wait, is there a smaller positive m? Let's see.

Wait, perhaps I should check if there are smaller m. Let me think. Since 110 is 8 mod17, and in the range 1 to 17, the solutions mod17 are 8 and 9, because 8⁴≡-1 mod17, and 9=17-8=9, which would also satisfy 9⁴≡( -8)^4=8⁴≡-1 mod17.

Wait, but 9⁴= (9²)^2=81². 81 mod17: 17*4=68, 81-68=13. So 13²=169 mod17=16. 16≡-1 mod17. So yes, 9⁴≡-1 mod17 as well.

So when lifting to mod289, we have x=8+17k and x=9+17k. Wait, but earlier I only considered x=8+17k. Maybe I should also check x=9+17k. Let me see if that gives a smaller m.

Let me try x=9 +17k.

Compute x⁴ mod289. Again, expand (9 +17k)^4.

Using binomial expansion:

(9 +17k)^4 =9^4 +4*9^3*(17k) +6*9^2*(17k)^2 +4*9*(17k)^3 + (17k)^4.

Again, mod289, terms with (17k)^2 and higher are 0. So we have:

9^4 +4*9^3*(17k) mod289.

Compute 9^4: 9²=81, 81²=6561. 6561 mod289: Let's compute how many times 289 goes into 6561.

289*22=6358. 6561-6358=203. So 9^4 ≡203 mod289.

Compute 4*9³*(17k):

9³=729. 729 mod289: 289*2=578, 729-578=151. So 9³≡151 mod289.

So 4*151=604. 604 mod289: 289*2=578, 604-578=26. So 4*9³=26 mod289.

Then, 26*(17k)=26*17k=442k. 442 mod289: 442-289=153. So 442k≡153k mod289.

So overall, (9+17k)^4 ≡203 +153k mod289.

Set this equal to 288 mod289:

203 +153k ≡288 mod289.

Subtract 203: 153k ≡85 mod289.

Now, solve 153k ≡85 mod289.

Compute GCD(153,289). 289 ÷153=1, remainder 136.

153 ÷136=1, remainder 17.

136 ÷17=8, remainder 0.

So GCD is 17. Now, does 17 divide 85? 85 ÷17=5. So yes.

Divide the equation by 17: (153/17)k ≡85/17 mod289/17.

Which simplifies to 9k ≡5 mod17.

Multiplicative inverse of 9 mod17: 9*2=18≡1 mod17. So inverse is 2.

Multiply both sides: k≡5*2=10 mod17.

So k=10 +17t. But since k must be between 0 and 16, k=10.

So x=9 +17*10=9 +170=179.

So x=179 is another solution mod289. Let me check if 179⁴ ≡-1 mod289.

Compute 179 mod289 is 179. 179²=32041. 32041 mod289: Let's compute 289*110=289*100=28900, 289*10=2890, so 289*110=28900+2890=31790. 32041 -31790=251. So 179²≡251 mod289.

Then, 251²=63001 mod289: As before, 63001 -289*217=63001 -62713=288. So 251²≡288 mod289.

Thus, 179⁴=(179²)²≡251²≡288≡-1 mod289. So yes, 179 is another solution. Now, 179 is less than 289, but is it the smallest positive solution?

Wait, 110 is less than 179, so 110 is smaller. So the minimal positive m is 110? But wait, perhaps there's a smaller m than 110.

Wait, maybe I should check numbers less than 110 to see if any satisfy m⁴ ≡-1 mod289. Let me see.

Since 110 is 8 mod17, and 179 is 9 mod17. Since 8 and 9 are the only solutions mod17, the solutions mod289 would be 8 +17k and 9 +17k for k such that x is in [1,288].

So, the minimal positive solutions would be 8 +17*6=110 and 9 +17*10=179. So 110 is the smallest positive solution.

Wait, but is there a smaller positive m? Let me check m=110 mod289 is 110. So the minimal positive m is 110. So m=110.

Wait, but let me check m=110: 110⁴ +1=110⁴ +1. Let me compute 110 mod289 is 110. So 110²=12100 mod289=12100 -41*289=12100 -11849=251. Then 251²=63001, which mod289 is 288, so 110⁴=288 mod289, so 110⁴ +1=289≡0 mod289. So yes, m=110 works.

Is there a smaller m? Let's see.

Since x=110 is the smallest solution in the range 1 to 288, there's no smaller positive integer than 110 that satisfies m⁴ ≡-1 mod289. Because the next solution would be 110 -289= negative, which isn't positive. So 110 is indeed the minimal positive integer.

Wait, but wait a second, maybe I should check if m=110 is indeed the minimal. Let me see, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of k earlier. Let me go back.

When I set x=8 +17k, I found k=6, leading to m=110. Now, is there any k less than 6 that could lead to a solution mod289?

Wait, but when I solved 136k ≡238 mod289, I found k≡6 mod17. So the minimal k is 6, so x=8+17*6=110. So I don't think there's a smaller k, so 110 is the smallest positive m.

So, putting it all together, the least prime p is 17, and the minimal positive integer m is 110.


To solve the problem, we need to find the smallest prime \( p \) such that there exists a positive integer \( n \) where \( n^4 + 1 \) is divisible by \( p^2 \). Then, we need to determine the smallest positive integer \( m \) such that \( m^4 + 1 \) is divisible by \( p^2 \).

### Step 1: Identify the smallest prime \( p \)

We start by checking small primes to see if \( n^4 \equiv -1 \pmod{p} \) has a solution. 

- For \( p = 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13 \), we find that none of these primes satisfy \( n^4 \equiv -1 \pmod{p} \).
- For \( p = 17 \), we compute \( n^4 \pmod{17} \) and find that \( n = 8 \) satisfies \( 8^4 \equiv -1 \pmod{17} \).

Thus, \( p = 17 \) is the smallest prime for which \( n^4 + 1 \) is divisible by \( p \).

### Step 2: Lift the solution to \( p^2 = 289 \)

Using Hensel's lemma, we lift the solution \( n = 8 \pmod{17} \) to modulo \( 289 \). We set \( n = 8 + 17k \) and solve for \( k \) such that \( (8 + 17k)^4 \equiv -1 \pmod{289} \).

Expanding and simplifying, we find \( k = 6 \), leading to \( n = 8 + 17 \times 6 = 110 \). Thus, \( 110^4 \equiv -1 \pmod{289} \).

### Step 3: Verify minimality of \( m \)

We check if there is a smaller positive integer \( m \) than \( 110 \) satisfying \( m^4 \equiv -1 \pmod{289} \). Since the solutions mod \( 289 \) are \( 110 \) and \( 179 \), and \( 110 \) is the smaller one, it is the minimal positive integer.

### Final Answer

The least prime \( p \) is \( 17 \), and the smallest positive integer \( m \) is \( 110 \).

\boxed{110}
