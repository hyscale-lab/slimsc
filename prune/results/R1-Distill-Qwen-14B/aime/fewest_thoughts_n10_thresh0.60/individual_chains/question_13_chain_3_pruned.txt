Okay, so I've got this math problem about Aya's morning walks. Let me try to understand what's being asked here. 

Every morning, Aya goes for a 9-kilometer walk and then stops at a coffee shop. The problem gives me two different scenarios about her walking speed and the time it takes, including the time she spends in the coffee shop. I need to find out how long her walk takes when she walks at a speed of s + 1/2 kilometers per hour, including the coffee shop time.

Let me break down the information:

1. When she walks at a constant speed of s km/h, the total time for her walk, including t minutes in the coffee shop, is 4 hours. So, the walking time plus coffee time equals 4 hours. 

2. When she increases her speed to s + 2 km/h, the total time becomes 2 hours and 24 minutes, which is still including the same t minutes in the coffee shop.

I think the key here is to figure out the relationship between her walking speed, the time she spends walking, and the total time including the coffee stop. Since the distance is the same in both cases (9 km), I can set up equations based on the formula:

Time = Distance / Speed

But wait, the total time includes both the walking time and the coffee time. So, I should express both situations with the same t value.

Let me convert all the times to hours to make the units consistent. 

First scenario: Total time is 4 hours. So, walking time is 4 hours minus t minutes. But t is in minutes, so I need to convert that to hours. Since 1 hour is 60 minutes, t minutes is t/60 hours.

So, the walking time for the first scenario is (4 - t/60) hours. The distance is 9 km, so:

9 = s * (4 - t/60)   ...(1)

Second scenario: Total time is 2 hours and 24 minutes. Let me convert 24 minutes to hours: 24/60 = 0.4 hours. So total time is 2 + 0.4 = 2.4 hours. Again, walking time is (2.4 - t/60) hours. Then:

9 = (s + 2) * (2.4 - t/60)   ...(2)
