Okay, so I have this problem here where I need to find the remainder when the product from k=0 to 12 of (2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k}) is divided by 1000. ω is a 13th root of unity, and it's not equal to 1. Hmm, that seems a bit tricky, but let's try to break it down.

First, I remember that roots of unity have some nice properties, especially when it comes to polynomials. Since ω is a primitive 13th root of unity, it satisfies ω^13 = 1, and the minimal polynomial for ω is the 13th cyclotomic polynomial, which is Φ₁₃(x) = x¹² + x¹¹ + ... + x + 1. But I'm not sure how that directly helps yet.

Looking at the product, each term is (2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k}). Let me see if I can factor this or relate it to something else. Maybe I can factor out a 2 or something. Let's rewrite the term:

2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k} = 2(1 - ω^k) + ω^{2k}.

Hmm, not sure if that helps. Alternatively, maybe I can think of it as a quadratic in ω^k. Let me set x = ω^k, so the term becomes 2 - 2x + x². That's a quadratic in x: x² - 2x + 2.

Wait, I can factor that quadratic. Let me check the discriminant: b² - 4ac = 4 - 8 = -4. So the roots would be [2 ± sqrt(-4)]/2 = [2 ± 2i]/2 = 1 ± i. So it factors as (x - (1+i))(x - (1-i)).

So, the term 2 - 2x + x² is equal to (x - (1+i))(x - (1-i)). So, substituting back x = ω^k, each term in the product becomes (ω^k - (1+i))(ω^k - (1-i)).

Therefore, the entire product is the product from k=0 to 12 of (ω^k - (1+i))(ω^k - (1-i)). Which is the same as the product from k=0 to 12 of (ω^k - (1+i)) multiplied by the product from k=0 to 12 of (ω^k - (1-i)).

Now, the product over (ω^k - a) for k=0 to 12 is similar to evaluating the polynomial Φ₁₃(x) at x = a, but actually, wait, Φ₁₃(x) is the minimal polynomial, which is the product over (x - ω^k) for k=0 to 12, but ω^0 is 1, so Φ₁₃(x) would be (x - 1)(x - ω)(x - ω²)...(x - ω¹²). So, if I have the product over (ω^k - a), that's the same as evaluating Φ₁₃(a), but with a sign change? Wait, let's see:

Φ₁₃(x) = ∏_{k=0}^{12} (x - ω^k) = x¹² + x¹¹ + ... + x + 1.

So, if I have ∏_{k=0}^{12} (ω^k - a) = ∏_{k=0}^{12} (-1)(a - ω^k) = (-1)^13 ∏_{k=0}^{12} (a - ω^k) ) = (-1)^13 Φ₁₃(a).

Since 13 is odd, (-1)^13 is -1. So,
