Okay, so I have this geometry problem here about two rectangles, ABCD and EFGH. The problem says that points D, E, C, F are collinear. Also, points A, D, H, G all lie on a circle. The given lengths are BC=16, AB=107, FG=17, and EF=184. I need to find the length of CE.

Hmm, let's try to visualize this. I'm picturing two rectangles. Since ABCD is a rectangle, AB and BC are sides. So AB is 107 units long, and BC is 16 units. So, if I imagine rectangle ABCD, it's a tall, narrow rectangle because AB is much longer than BC. Let me sketch this mentally: A is connected to B, which is 107 units away, then B to C is 16 units, making a right angle. Then C to D is 107 units, and D back to A is 16 units.

Similarly, rectangle EFGH has sides EF=184 and FG=17. So EF is longer, and FG is shorter. So EFGH is another tall, narrow rectangle, but maybe even taller than ABCD since EF is longer than AB.

The points D, E, C, F are collinear. So these four points lie on a straight line. Let me think about how that could be. Since D and C are corners of rectangle ABCD, which is connected to E and F, which are corners of rectangle EFGH. Hmm, perhaps the line is along DC, and E and F lie somewhere on that line.

Wait, but in rectangle ABCD, D and C are adjacent vertices. So DC is one side of ABCD, which is 107 units long, same as AB. So DC is a horizontal side if AB is vertical.

Wait, actually, in a rectangle, adjacent sides are perpendicular. So if AB is vertical (length 107), then BC would be horizontal (length 16). So D would be the next point after C, which would be 16 units to the right of B? Wait, maybe I should assign coordinates to make this clearer.

Let's assign coordinates to the points. Let me place point A at (0, 0). Then since AB is 107 units, and AB is a vertical side, point B would be at (0, 107). BC is 16 units, so from B, moving 16 units to the right (since in a rectangle, sides are perpendicular), point C would be at (16, 107). Then point D would be at (16, 0), completing the rectangle.

Wait, but that would make AD a vertical line from (0,0) to (16, 0), but AD should be a horizontal side if AB is vertical. Wait, perhaps I'm mixing up the sides. Let me think again.

In rectangle ABCD, AB and CD are one pair of opposite sides, and BC and AD are the other pair. So if AB is 107, then CD is also 107. BC is 16, so AD is 16. So if I place A at (0,0), then B would be at
