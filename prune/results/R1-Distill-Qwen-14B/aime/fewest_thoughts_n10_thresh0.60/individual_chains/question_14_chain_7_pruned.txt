Okay, so I've got this math problem here that I need to solve. Let me read it again and make sure I understand what it's asking.

The problem says: Let N be the greatest four-digit positive integer with the property that whenever one of its digits is changed to 1, the resulting number is divisible by 7. Then, Q and R are the quotient and remainder when N is divided by 1000. We need to find Q + R.

Hmm, okay. So N is a four-digit number, the largest possible, such that if any one of its digits is replaced by 1, the new number is divisible by 7. Then, we divide N by 1000 and add the quotient and remainder together.

Let me break this down. First, I need to find N. Since N is the greatest four-digit number with this property, I should probably start checking from 9999 downwards until I find such a number. But that seems time-consuming. Maybe there's a smarter way.

Let me think about the property. For any digit in N, if I change it to 1, the number becomes divisible by 7. So, for each digit position (thousands, hundreds, tens, units), replacing that digit with 1 results in a number divisible by 7.

Let me represent N as a four-digit number: N = ABCD, where A, B, C, D are its digits, with A ≠ 0 since it's a four-digit number.

So, when we replace A with 1, the number becomes 1BCD, which must be divisible by 7.

Similarly, replacing B with 1 gives A1CD, which must be divisible by 7.

Replacing C with 1 gives AB1D, which must be divisible by 7.

Replacing D with 1 gives ABC1, which must be divisible by 7.

So each of these four numbers must be divisible by 7.

Therefore, N has four conditions:

1. 1BCD ≡ 0 mod 7
2. A1CD ≡ 0 mod 7
3. AB1D ≡ 0 mod 7
4. ABC1 ≡ 0 mod 7

Since N is the largest possible four-digit number with this property, we should aim for the largest possible N, so starting from 9999 and moving down.

Wait, but how can we use these four conditions efficiently?

Perhaps we can model each condition as a congruence. Let me try to write each condition in terms of N.

Let me express each modified number as N with a particular digit replaced by 1.

So, replacing A with 1: the new number is 1000*1 + B*100 + C*10 + D = 1000 + 100B + 10C + D.

Similarly, replacing B with 1: A*1000 + 1*100 + C*10 + D = 1000A + 100 + 10C + D.

Replacing C with 1: A*1000 + B*100 + 1*10 + D = 1000A + 100B + 10 + D.

Replacing D with 1: A*1000 + B*100 + C*10 + 1 = 1000A + 100B + 10C + 1.

Each of these numbers must be divisible by 7.

But N itself is 1000A + 100B + 10C + D.

So, let's write the four conditions
