Okay, so I've got this problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me try to parse it out and see what's going on.

First, the problem introduces three points: O at (0,0), A at (1/2, 0), and B at (0, sqrt(3)/2). So, O is the origin, A is on the x-axis halfway between the origin and (1,0), and B is on the y-axis... let me calculate that point's exact position. sqrt(3)/2 is approximately 0.866, so B is somewhere above (0, 1) but below (0, 0.9). 

Then, the problem talks about a family F of segments PQ of unit length in the first quadrant. Each segment PQ has P on the x-axis and Q on the y-axis. So, these are segments from the x-axis to the y-axis with length 1. That makes sense. So, for example, if P is some point (p, 0) on the x-axis, then Q must be a point (0, q) on the y-axis such that the distance between (p, 0) and (0, q) is 1. So, the distance formula would be sqrt(p² + q²) = 1, which simplifies to p² + q² = 1.

Wait, so for each such segment PQ, P is (p, 0) and Q is (0, q), and p² + q² = 1. So, the family F consists of all such segments where p and q are positive real numbers because we're in the first quadrant.

Now, the problem says that there's a unique point C on segment AB, different from A and B, that doesn't belong to any segment from F other than AB. So, point C is on AB, but it's not A or B. And the key is that this point C is only on the segment AB, and not on any other segment from the family F. So, for all other segments PQ in F, C is not on PQ. So, C is only on AB and none of the other PQs.

Our goal is to find OC², where O is the origin, and then express it as a fraction p/q with p and q coprime, and find p + q.

Alright, so I need to find point C on AB such that it's only on AB and not on any other PQ in F. So, C is the only such point with this property.

First, let me visualize this. Points O, A, B form a triangle in the first quadrant. AB is a line segment from (1/2, 0) to (0, sqrt(3)/2). Let me find the equation of line AB.

To find the equation of the line AB, I can compute the slope first.

Slope m = (y2 - y1)/(x2 - x1) = (sqrt(3)/2 - 0)/(0 - 1/2) = (sqrt(3)/2) / (-1/2) = -sqrt(3).

So, the slope of AB is -sqrt(3). So, the equation of line AB can be written as y = -sqrt(3)x + b. To find b, plug in point A: (1/2, 0).

0 = -sqrt(3)*(1/2) + b → b = sqrt(3)/2.

So, the equation of AB is y = -sqrt(3)x + sqrt(3)/2.

So, any point C on AB will satisfy this equation.

Now, point C is (x, y) where y = -sqrt(3)x + sqrt(3)/2.

We need to find such a point C that it's not on any other PQ in F except AB. So, for all other PQ in F, the distance from P to Q is 1, with P(p,0) and Q(0,q), p² + q² = 1.

So, if C is on AB and also on some PQ, then C must satisfy both the equation of AB and the equation of PQ.

Therefore, for each PQ, which has equation (x/p) + (y/q) = 1, since PQ is the line connecting (p,0) and (0,q). So, the equation of PQ is x/p + y/q = 1.

So, any point on PQ must satisfy x/p + y/q = 1. And since PQ is of unit length, p² + q² = 1.

So, point C = (x, y) lies on AB: y = -sqrt(3)x + sqrt(3)/2.

And if C is on any other PQ, then x/p + y/q = 1, with p² + q² = 1.

But since C is supposed to lie only on AB and no other PQ, that means that for all other PQ in F, the equation x/p + y/q = 1 does not hold. So, except for PQ being AB itself, point C is not on any other PQ.

Wait, but AB is itself a PQ in F? Let me see. Let's check if AB is such a segment.

Wait, AB is from (1/2, 0
