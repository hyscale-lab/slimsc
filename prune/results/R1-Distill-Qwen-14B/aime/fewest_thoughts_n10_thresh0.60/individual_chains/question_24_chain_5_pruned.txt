Okay, so I have this math problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again and understand what's being asked.

The problem states: There's a list of positive integers with three properties. First, the sum of all the items is 30. Second, the unique mode is 9. Third, the median is a positive integer that doesn't appear in the list itself. I need to find the sum of the squares of all the items in the list.

Alright, let's break this down. I'll start by recalling what each term means.

1. **Sum of the items is 30**: So whatever numbers are in the list, when I add them all up, they total 30.

2. **Unique mode is 9**: Mode is the number that appears most frequently in the list. Since it's the unique mode, 9 must appear more times than any other number in the list. So no other number can appear as many times as 9.

3. **Median is a positive integer not in the list**: Median is the middle value when the numbers are arranged in order. For an even-length list, it's the average of the two middle numbers. But in this case, the median is an integer that doesn't appear in the list. That's interesting because usually, the median can be one of the numbers in the list, especially if the list has an odd number of elements. But here, it's not, so that gives me some constraints.

So, let's think about the structure of the list.

First, the mode is 9, which suggests that 9 appears more times than any other number. So the list must have multiple 9s.

The median is a positive integer not in the list. Let's consider whether the list has an odd or even number of elements because that affects how the median is calculated.

Wait, since the median is an integer not in the list, that tells me something about the length of the list. Let's suppose the list has n elements.

If n is odd, the median is the middle element when sorted. For example, if n=5, the median is the 3rd element. But in this case, the median is not in the list. That would only be possible if the list has an even number of elements because then the median is the average of two middle numbers. For example, n=4, the median is (2nd + 3rd)/2. If this median is an integer and not present in the list, the two middle numbers must be such that their average is an integer but neither is equal to it.

Alternatively, for n even, the median is the average of two middle elements, and since it's an integer, those two must add up to an even number. So, the two middle numbers must either both be even or both be odd.

Wait, but the median is a positive integer that doesn't appear in the list. So for example, if the list has 4 elements, the median is (a2 + a3)/2. Since it's an integer, (a2 + a3) must be even, so a2 and a3 are both even or both odd. Also, this median integer should not be equal to a2 or a3 because then it would appear in the list. So, if the median is an integer, say m, then m = (a2 + a3)/2, but m is not equal to a2 or a3. That implies that a2 and a3 must be such that their average is a number different from both. So, for instance, a2 and a3 could be consecutive even numbers
