Okay, so I have this math problem here, and I need to figure out the sum of the squares of all the items in the list. Let me read the problem again and understand each condition.

The list of positive integers has three properties:

1. The sum of the items is 30.
2. The unique mode is 9.
3. The median is a positive integer that doesn't appear in the list itself.

And I need to find the sum of the squares of all the items. Hmm, okay. Let's break this down step by step.

First, let's recall some definitions to make sure I'm on the right track.

- **Mode**: The mode is the number that appears most frequently in the list. The problem says it's unique, so only 9 appears more times than any other number.
- **Median**: The median is the middle number when the list is ordered. If there's an even number of elements, it's the average of the two middle numbers. But the problem says the median is a positive integer that doesn't appear in the list. So, if the median is an integer, it must be either the average of two equal integers (which would make the median equal to those integers, but the problem says it doesn't appear), so maybe the median is the average of two different integers that are consecutive numbers?

Wait, that's a bit confusing. Let me think. If the median is an integer and doesn't appear in the list, that suggests that the median is the average of two different numbers. Because if you have an even number of elements, the median is the average of the two middle terms. So for the median to be an integer, those two middle terms must add up to an even number, meaning they're both even or both odd. But since the median doesn't appear in the list, those two middle numbers can't be the same. So they must be consecutive integers, right? Because if they were the same, the median would be that same number, which would appear in the list, but the problem says it doesn't. So, for example, if the two middle numbers are 8 and 10, their average is 9, which is the mode and doesn't appear in the list.

Wait, but 9 is the mode. So if I have the median as 9, but 9 doesn't appear in the list, that's conflicting because 9 is the mode, which must appear at least once. Hmm, so maybe the median isn't 9. Maybe it's something else. Let me think again.

Wait, no, the median is a positive integer that doesn't appear in the list. So the median can be any integer, but it's not in the list. The mode is 9, which does appear in the list.

So,
