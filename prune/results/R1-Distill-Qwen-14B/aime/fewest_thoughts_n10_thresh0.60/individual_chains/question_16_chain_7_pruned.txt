Okay, so I came across this math problem, and it's a bit challenging, but I'm going to try to work through it step by step. Let me try to understand what's being asked here.

The problem says: Let p be the least prime number for which there exists a positive integer n such that n⁴ + 1 is divisible by p². Then, I need to find the least positive integer m such that m⁴ + 1 is divisible by p². 

Alright, so first, I need to find the smallest prime p where p² divides some n⁴ + 1. Once I find that p, I need to find the smallest m where m⁴ +1 is divisible by p². 

Let me think about primes and their properties. I remember that for primes p, certain conditions must be met for equations like n⁴ ≡ -1 mod p² to have solutions. Maybe I should start by checking small primes and see if any satisfy this condition.

The first few primes are 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, etc. I need to check each one to see if there's an n such that n⁴ ≡ -1 mod p².

Starting with the smallest prime, p=2. Let's see if there's an n where n⁴ +1 is divisible by 2²=4. Let's test n=1: 1⁴ +1=2, which is not divisible by 4. n=2: 16 +1=17, which isn't divisible by 4. n=3: 81 +1=82, which is 2 mod 4, not divisible by 4. Wait, but wait, maybe there's a pattern here. Let me think—n⁴ mod 4: For even n, n is even, so n² is 0 mod 4, so n⁴ is 0 mod 4. Then n⁴ +1 is 1 mod 4. For odd n, n is 1 mod 2, so n² is 1 mod 4, and n⁴ is 1 mod 4. So n⁴ +1 is 2 mod 4. So for p=2, n⁴+1 is either 1 or 2 mod 4, so it's never 0 mod 4. So p=2 doesn't work.

Next, p=3. Check if there exists an n such that n⁴ ≡ -1 mod 9. Let's compute n⁴ mod 9 for n from 1 to 8, since mod 9 cycles every 9 numbers.

n=1: 1⁴=1 mod9 → 1+1=2≠0 mod9
n=2: 16 mod9=7 → 7+1=8≠0
n=3: 81 mod9=0 → 0 +1=1≠0
n=4: 256 mod9. Let's calculate: 256 divided by 9 is 28*9=252, remainder 4. So 4 mod9. 4+1=5≠0
n=5: 625 mod9. 625/9=69*9=621, remainder 4. 4+1=5≠0
n=6: 6⁴=1296 mod9=0 → 0+1=1≠0
n=7: 7⁴=2401. Let's compute 2401 mod9. Sum of digits: 2+4+0+1=7, so 7 mod9. 7+1=8≠0
n=8: 8⁴=4096. Sum of digits:4+0+9+6=19, which is 1 mod9. 1+1=2≠0.

So none of n=1 to 8 give n⁴ +1 ≡0 mod9. So p=3 doesn't work either.

Next prime, p=5. Let's check if there's an n such that n⁴ ≡ -1 mod25. So n⁴ ≡24 mod25.

I should compute n⁴ mod25 for n=1 to 24 (since mod25 cycles every 25 numbers). But that's a bit tedious, maybe I can find a smarter way.

Alternatively, maybe I can use Euler's theorem or properties of exponents modulo primes.

First, note that 5 is a prime, and 4 is even, so maybe the multiplicative order of n modulo 5²=25 is a factor here.

Wait, but perhaps it's easier to look for solutions to n⁴ ≡ -1 mod25.

I can try n=2: 16 mod25 → 16 +1=17≠0
n=3: 81 mod25=6 → 6+1=7≠0
n=7: 7⁴=49²=2401. 2401 mod25: 25*96=2400, so remainder 1. 1+1=2≠0
n=8: 8⁴=4096.
