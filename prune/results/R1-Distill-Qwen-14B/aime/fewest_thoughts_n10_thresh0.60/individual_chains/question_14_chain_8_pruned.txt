Okay, let me try to figure out this math problem. So, the problem is about finding the greatest four-digit number N with a specific property. The property is that if any one of its digits is changed to 1, the resulting number is divisible by 7. Then, once we find N, we have to find Q + R where Q is the quotient and R is the remainder when N is divided by 1000.

Hmm, okay. Let me start by breaking down the problem. First, N is a four-digit number, so it's between 1000 and 9999. We need the largest such number, so ideally, we want N to be as close to 9999 as possible. But it has to satisfy that condition where changing any single digit to 1 makes the number divisible by 7.

Let me think about what that means. So, for each digit in N, if I replace it with 1, the new number should be divisible by 7. So, N has four digits: let's denote them as d1, d2, d3, d4, where d1 is the thousands digit, d2 the hundreds, d3 the tens, and d4 the ones digit.

So, the number N is d1 d2 d3 d4. When any one of these digits is changed to 1, the resulting number must be divisible by 7. That means:

1. Changing d1 to 1: the number becomes 1 d2 d3 d4, and this should be divisible by 7.
2. Changing d2 to 1: the number becomes d1 1 d3 d4, and this should be divisible by 7.
3. Changing d3 to 1: the number becomes d1 d2 1 d4, and this should be divisible by 7.
4. Changing d4 to 1: the number becomes d1 d2 d3 1, and this should be divisible by 7.

So, all four of these modified numbers must be divisible by 7. Our goal is to find the largest N satisfying this.

Since we're looking for the greatest possible N, we can start from 9999 and check downwards until we find such a number. But since that might take a while, maybe there's a smarter way.

Let me think about the structure of N. Let's consider each digit:

1. When d1 is changed to 1, the new number is 1000 + 100*d2 + 10*d3 + d4. This must be divisible by 7.

2. When d2 is changed to 1, the new number is 1000*d1 + 100*1 + 10*d3 + d4 = 1000*d1 + 100 + 10*d3 + d4. This must be divisible by 7.

3. When d3 is changed to 1, the number is 1000*d1 + 100*d2 + 10*1 + d4 = 1000*d1 + 100*d2 + 10 + d4. This must be divisible by 7.

4. When d4 is changed to 1, the number is 1000*d1 + 100*d2 + 10*d3 + 1. This must be divisible by 7.

So, for each of these four modified numbers, the number modulo 7 must be zero. So, perhaps we can write equations based on modulo 7 for each condition.

Let me denote N as 1000a + 100b + 10c + d, where a, b, c, d are the digits (a from 1-9, others from 0-9).

Then, the four modified numbers are:

1. 1000*1 + 100b + 10c + d = 1000 + 100b + 10c + d. Let me call this N1.

2. 1000a + 100*1 + 10c + d = 1000a + 100 + 10c + d. Let me call this N2.

3. 1000a + 100b + 10*1 + d = 1000a + 100b + 10 + d. Let me call this N3.

4. 1000a + 100b + 10c + 1 = N + 1 - 10c - d + 1? Wait, no. Wait, in the original N, it's 1000a + 100b + 10c + d. When changing d to 1, it's 1000a + 100b + 10c + 1. Let me call this N4.

Each of N1, N2, N3, N4 must be divisible by 7. So, N1 ≡ 0 mod7, N2 ≡0 mod7, etc.

Alternatively, since N1 is 1000 + 100b + 10c + d, which is also N - 1000a + 1000.

Wait, let me think. N is 1000a + 100b + 10c + d. So N1 is 1000 + 100b + 10c + d. So, N1 = 1000 + (N - 1000a). Because N is 1000a + 100b + 10c + d, subtract 1000a and you get 100b + 10c + d. So N1 is 1000 + (N - 1000a).

Similarly, N2 is 1000a + 100 + 10c + d = 1000a + (100 + 10c + d). But N is 1000a + 100b + 10c + d. So N2 is N - 100b + 100.

Hmm, maybe this is getting a bit complicated. Alternatively, perhaps it's better to consider N mod7 for each condition.

Wait, let's consider N1, N2, N3, N4 each ≡0 mod7.

So, N1 ≡0 mod7. N1 is 1000 + 100b +10c +d. So, 1000 + (100b +10c +d) ≡0 mod7.

But 1000 mod7: Let's compute that. 7*142=994, so 1000-994=6. So 1000 ≡6 mod7.

So, N1 ≡6 + (100b +10c +d) ≡0 mod7.

Which implies that (100b +10c +d) ≡1 mod7 because 6 + x ≡0 ⇒ x ≡1 mod7.

Similarly, N2: 1000a + 100 +10c +d ≡0 mod7.

Compute 1000a mod7: 1000 ≡6 mod7, so 1000a ≡6a mod7.

100 ≡2 mod7 because 7*14=98, so 100-98=2.

So, 1000a + 100 ≡6a +2 mod7.

Then, adding 10c +d: which is 10c +d. Let's see, 10c mod7 is 3c because 10 ≡3 mod7.

So, 10c +d ≡3c +d mod7.

So, overall, N2 ≡6a +2 +3c +d ≡0 mod7.

Similarly, N3: 1000a +100b +10 +d ≡0 mod7.

Compute 1000a +100b mod7: 1000a ≡6a, 100b ≡2b. So 6a +2b.

Then, 10 ≡3 mod7, so 10 ≡3, so adding 3 +d.

So N3 ≡6a +2b +3 +d ≡0 mod7.

Finally, N4: 1000a +100b +10c +1 ≡0 mod7.

Which is (1000a +100b +10c) +1 ≡0 mod7.

1000a ≡6a, 100b ≡2b, 10c ≡3c. So 6a +2b +3c +1 ≡0 mod7.

So, summarizing, we have four congruence equations:

1. (100b +10c +d) ≡1 mod7.

But 100b +10c +d is N - 1000a. But perhaps better to think in terms of mod7.

Wait, 100b +10c +d is equal to 100b +10c +d.

Let me compute 100b mod7: 100 ≡2 mod7, so 100b ≡2b.

10c ≡3c mod7.

d is d mod7.

So, 100b +10c +d ≡2b +3c +d mod7.

So equation 1: 2b +3c +d ≡1 mod7.

Equation 2: 6a +2 +3c +d ≡0 mod7.

Equation 3: 6a +2b +3 +d ≡0 mod7.

Equation 4: 6a +2b +3c +1 ≡0 mod7.

So, we have:

1. 2b +3c +d ≡1 mod7. (from N1)
2. 6a +2 +3c +d ≡0 mod7. (from N2)
3. 6a +2b +3 +d ≡0 mod7. (from N3)
4. 6a +2b +3c +1 ≡0 mod7. (from N4)

So, four equations with variables a, b, c, d, each being digits (a:1-9, b,c,d:0-9).

We also know that N is a four-digit number, so a can be from 1 to 9, and b, c, d from 0 to 9.

Our goal is to find the maximum possible N, so we want a as large as possible, then b, then c, then d.

So, perhaps we can try to find a, starting from 9, and for each a, try to find b, c, d that satisfy all four equations.

Alternatively, perhaps we can find relations between the equations to solve for variables.

Let me see if I can express some variables in terms of others.

Looking at equations 2 and 3:

Equation 2: 6a +2 +3c +d ≡0 mod7.

Equation 3: 6a +2b +3 +d ≡0 mod7.

Subtract equation 3 from equation 2:

(6a +2 +3c +d) - (6a +2b +3 +d) ≡
