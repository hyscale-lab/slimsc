Okay, so I've got this math problem here. It says that there are real numbers x and y, both greater than 1, such that log base x of y^x equals 10, and log base y of x^(4y) also equals 10. I need to find the product xy.

Hmm. Let me start by writing down the given equations. So, the first equation is log_x(y^x) = 10. The second one is log_y(x^{4y}) = 10. Both logs equal 10, so maybe I can set them equal to each other or find some relationship between x and y.

Wait, logarithms. Remember that log_b(a) = c is equivalent to b^c = a. So, maybe I can rewrite these equations in exponential form to make them easier to handle.

Starting with the first equation: log_x(y^x) = 10. Converting to exponential form, that would mean x^10 = y^x. Right? Because if log_x(y^x) is 10, then x raised to the 10th power equals y^x.

Similarly, the second equation: log_y(x^{4y}) = 10. Converting that, it would be y^10 = x^{4y}. So, y^10 equals x to the power of 4y.

So now I have two equations:

1. x^10 = y^x
2. y^10 = x^{4y}

Hmm, okay. Let me see if I can express one variable in terms of the other from the first equation and substitute into the second.

From the first equation: x^10 = y^x. Let me take the xth root of both sides to get y. So, y = (x^10)^(1/x). Simplifying that exponent, it's x^(10/x). So, y = x^(10/x).

Now, substitute this expression for y into the second equation. So, the second equation is y^10 = x^{4y}. Substituting y, we have (x^(10/x))^10 = x^{4y}.

Let me compute the left side first. (x^(10/x))^10 is x^(10/x * 10) which is x^(100/x). So, the left side is x^(100/x).

The right side is x^{4y}. But y is x^(10/x), so 4y would be 4*x^(10/x). So, the right side becomes x^(4*x^(10/x)).

So now, the equation is x^(100/x) = x^(4*x^(10/x)). Since the bases are the same and x > 1, the exponents must be equal.

So, set the exponents equal to each other: 100/x = 4*x^(10/x).

Hmm, that's an equation in terms of x. Let me write that down: 100/x = 4*x^(10/x). Let me try to simplify this.

First, divide both sides by 4 to make it simpler: (100/x)/4 = x^(10/x). So, 25/x = x^(10/x).

Hmm. Let me rewrite x^(10/x) as e^( (10/x) * ln x ). But maybe that's too complicated. Alternatively, I can take both sides and take logarithms, perhaps.

Let me take the natural logarithm of both sides. So, ln(25/x) = (10/x) * ln x.

Let me compute ln(25/x). That's ln 25 - ln x. So, ln(25) - ln x = (10/x) * ln x.

So, I have the equation: ln(25) - ln x = (10 ln x)/x.

Hmm, that's a transcendental equation. Not sure if it can be solved algebraically. Maybe I can rearrange terms or make a substitution.

Let me set t = ln x. Then, x = e^t. Let's substitute that into the equation.

So, ln(25) - t = (10 t)/e^t.

So, the equation becomes: ln(25) - t = (10 t) e^{-t}.

Hmm, that's a bit better. Let me write it as:

ln(25) - t = 10 t e^{-t}

I can rearrange terms:

ln(25) = t + 10 t e^{-t}

Factor t:

ln(25) = t (1 + 10 e^{-t})

Hmm, this looks tricky. Maybe I can guess a value for t that satisfies this equation.

Wait, ln(25) is approximately ln(25) ≈ 3.2189.

So, if I can find t such that t (1 + 10 e^{-t}) ≈ 3.2189.

Let me try t=2: 2 (1 + 10 e^{-2}) ≈ 2*(1 + 10*0.1353) ≈
