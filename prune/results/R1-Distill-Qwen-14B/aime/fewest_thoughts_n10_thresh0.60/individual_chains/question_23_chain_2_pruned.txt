Okay, so I've got this problem here about a hyperbola and a rhombus. Let me read it again carefully.

It says: Let A, B, C, D be points on the hyperbola x²/20 - y²/24 = 1 such that ABCD is a rhombus whose diagonals intersect at the origin. I need to find the greatest real number that is less than BD² for all such rhombi.

Hmm, okay. So the hyperbola is given, and the rhombus has its diagonals intersecting at the origin. I remember that in a rhombus, the diagonals bisect each other at right angles, but wait, no, actually, in a rhombus, the diagonals bisect each other and are perpendicular but aren't necessarily equal in length unless it's a square. Wait, no, in a square, which is a special case of a rhombus, the diagonals are equal and perpendicular.

But in this case, it's a general rhombus with diagonals intersecting at the origin. So the origin is the midpoint of both diagonals. So points A, B, C, D are on the hyperbola, and the diagonals are AC and BD, intersecting at the origin.

Since the diagonals intersect at the origin, the coordinates of the points must be arranged such that if A is (x, y), then C is (-x, -y), because the origin is the midpoint. Similarly, if B is (p, q), then D is (-p, -q). Because in a rhombus, the diagonals bisect each other.

So the four points are A(x, y), B(p, q), C(-x, -y), D(-p, -q).

Since all four points lie on the hyperbola x²/20 - y²/24 =1, so substituting each point into the hyperbola equation:

For A: x²/20 - y²/24 =1
For B: p²/20 - q²/24 =1
For C: (-x)²/20 - (-y)²/24 = x²/20 - y²/24 =1
Same for D: (-p)²/20 - (-q)²/24 = p²/20 - q²/24 =1

So all four points satisfy the hyperbola equation.

Now, since ABCD is a rhombus, all sides are equal. So the distance between A and B must equal the distance between B and C, and so on.

But in a rhombus, it's sufficient to ensure that the adjacent sides are equal. So AB = BC = CD = DA.

Wait, but given that the diagonals intersect at the origin, another way to think about the rhombus is in terms of vectors.

Let me consider vectors OA and OB, where O is the origin. Since the diagonals are AC and BD, OA and OB are vectors from the origin to A and B respectively. Then, in a rhombus, the diagonals are perpendicular? No, wait, in a rhombus, the diagonals are not necessarily perpendicular, but in a square they are. Wait, no, actually, in a rhombus, the diagonals are perpendicular
