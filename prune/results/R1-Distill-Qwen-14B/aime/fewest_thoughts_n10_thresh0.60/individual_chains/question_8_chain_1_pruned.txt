Okay, so I've got this problem where I need to find the number of triples of nonnegative integers (a, b, c) that satisfy two conditions: a + b + c = 300 and a²b + a²c + b²a + b²c + c²a + c²b = 6,000,000. Hmm, that seems a bit tricky, but I'll try to break it down.

First, let me write down the given equations:

1. a + b + c = 300
2. a²b + a²c + b²a + b²c + c²a + c²b = 6,000,000

I need to find all nonnegative integer solutions (a, b, c) satisfying both equations.

Looking at the second equation, I notice that it has terms like a²b, a²c, etc. Maybe I can factor it somehow. Let me see.

Let's factor the second equation:

a²b + a²c + b²a + b²c + c²a + c²b

I can factor a² from the first two terms: a²(b + c). Similarly, factor b² from the next two: b²(a + c), and c² from the last two: c²(a + b). So:

= a²(b + c) + b²(a + c) + c²(a + b)

Hmm, that seems better. Now, since a + b + c = 300, I can substitute (b + c) with (300 - a), (a + c) with (300 - b), and (a + b) with (300 - c).

So substituting:

= a²(300 - a) + b²(300 - b) + c²(300 - c)

Which simplifies to:

= 300a² - a³ + 300b² - b³ + 300c² - c³

So the second equation becomes:

300a² - a³ + 300b² - b³ + 300c² - c³ = 6,000,000

Hmm, that's a cubic equation in terms of a, b, and c. It might be complicated to handle all three variables at once. Maybe I can find a way to express this in terms of the sum a + b + c or something else.

Alternatively, perhaps I can factor the entire expression. Let me think.

Wait, another idea: since a, b, c are nonnegative integers and they sum up to 300, maybe I can assume some symmetry or find a substitution.

Let me consider the symmetric nature of the equation. The second equation is symmetric in a, b, c. So perhaps the solutions have some symmetry.

But maybe it's easier to consider cases where two variables are equal, or all three are equal, and see if that helps.

First, let me check if all variables are equal. If a = b = c, then since a + b + c =300, a = 100.

So substituting a = b = c =100 into the second equation:

Each term a²b is 100² * 100 = 1,000,000. There are six such terms, so 6 * 1,000,000 = 6,000,000. So that works. So (100,100,100) is a solution. But are there others?

So maybe other triples where a, b, c are not all equal? Let's see.

Let me consider another approach. Let me denote S = a + b + c = 300.

Let me compute the second equation:

E = a²b + a²c + b²a + b²c + c²a + c²b.

I can factor E as:

E = ab(a + b) + ac(a + c) + bc(b + c)

But since a + b + c = 300, a + b = 300 - c, a + c = 300 - b, b + c = 300 - a.

So, substituting:

E = ab(300 - c) + ac(300 - b) + bc(300 - a)

But that seems similar to what I did earlier. Alternatively, perhaps I can express E in terms of S and other symmetric sums.

Another idea: Let's compute E in terms of (ab + bc + ca) and other terms.

Wait, let me compute E:

E = a²b + a²c + b²a + b²c + c²a + c²b

= a²(b + c) + b²(a + c) + c²(a + b)

As I did earlier.

But since (b + c) = 300 - a, so:

E = 300a² - a³ + 300b² - b³ + 300c² - c³

So, E = 300(a² + b² + c²) - (a³ + b³ + c³) = 6,000,000

Hmm, let me write that as:

300(a² + b² + c²) - (a³ + b³ + c³) = 6,000,000

I wonder if I can relate this to other symmetric sums.

Let me recall that for three variables, the sums can be expressed in terms of elementary symmetric sums:

Let me denote:

S1 = a + b + c = 300

S2 = ab + bc + ca

S3 = abc

But I'm not sure if that's helpful here. Alternatively, maybe I can use the identity for a³ + b³ + c³.

I remember that a³ + b³ + c³ = (a + b + c)^3 - 3(a + b + c)(ab + bc + ca) + 3abc

So, a³ + b³ + c³ = S1³ - 3 S1 S2 + 3 S3

Similarly, a² + b² + c² can be written as S1² - 2 S2.

So, substituting into E:

E = 300(S1² - 2 S2) - [S1³ - 3 S1 S2 + 3 S3
