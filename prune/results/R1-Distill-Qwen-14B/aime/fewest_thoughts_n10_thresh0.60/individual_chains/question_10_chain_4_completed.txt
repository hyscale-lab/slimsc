Okay, let me try to figure out this problem. So Alice chooses a set A of positive integers. Then Bob lists all finite nonempty sets B of positive integers such that the maximum element of B is in A. Bob's list has 2024 sets. We need to find the sum of the elements of A.

Hmm, let's break this down. First, A is a set of positive integers. So A could be something like {1,2,3} or {2,4}, etc. Bob is creating a list of sets B, where each B is finite, nonempty, and the maximum element of B is in A. The number of such sets B is 2024.

I need to relate the size of A (the number of elements in A) to the number of sets B that Bob can list. So, perhaps I should find a formula that connects the size of A to the number of possible sets B.

Let me think, for each element a in A, how many sets B can have a as their maximum element? Well, if a is the maximum, then all other elements in B must be less than a. So the elements of B can be any combination of positive integers less than a. But since B has to be non-empty, for each a, the number of possible B's is 2^{a-1} - 1. Wait, no. Because each element in B must be a positive integer less than a, so the elements can be any subset of {1, 2, ..., a-1}, but B has to be non-empty. So the number of such subsets is 2^{a-1} - 1. But wait, the problem says all finite nonempty sets B with maximum in A. So for each a in A, the number of B's is 2^{a-1}.

Wait, hold on. Let's clarify. For each a in A, the number of non-empty subsets of {1, 2, ..., a-1} is 2^{a-1} - 1, right? Because the total subsets are 2^{a-1}, and subtracting the empty set gives 2^{a-1} - 1. But wait, no, that's not exactly correct. Because the elements of B don't have to be exactly {1,2,...,a-1}; they can be any set of positive integers less than a, but not necessarily consecutive. So actually, for each a, the number of possible B's with maximum a is 2^{a-1}, because each element can be any subset of {1,2,...,a-1}, including the empty set. Wait, but B has to be non-empty. So the number of non-empty subsets is 2^{a-1} - 1.

Wait, wait, no, no. Let me think again. If the maximum is a, then the other elements have to be any subset of {1,2,...,a-1}, including the empty set. But since B must be non-empty, the empty set isn't allowed. So the total number of B's with maximum a is 2^{a-1} - 1. Because 2^{a-1} is all subsets of {1,2,...,a-1}, and subtracting 1 for the empty set.

Wait, but that can't be right because if a=1, then the number of B's with maximum 1 is 2^{0} - 1 = 1 - 1 = 0, which is wrong because the only set B is {1} itself. So maybe I got that wrong.

Wait, if a=1, then the elements of B must be less than 1, but since we are dealing with positive integers, there are no elements less than 1. So the only possible set B is {1}, because it's non-empty and its maximum is 1. So in this case, the number of sets B with maximum 1 is 1. So my previous formula must be wrong.

Let me correct this. For each a in A, the number of sets B with maximum a is equal to the number of non-empty subsets of {1, 2, ..., a-1}, each combined with a. But wait, actually, the set B can include any combination of numbers less than a, but since the maximum is a, it's just the set of all possible subsets of {1,2,...,a-1}, but each such subset must be non-empty? Or can it be empty?

Wait, no. Because B has to be non-empty. So if a is the maximum, B can be {a} alone, which corresponds to the empty subset of {1,2,...,a-1}, or it can be {a, x} where x is less than a, etc. So the number of possible B's for a given a is equal to the number of subsets of {1,2,...,a-1}, which is 2^{a-1}, but each subset can be empty as well because {a} is allowed. However, since B must be non-empty, and {a} is non-empty, the total number of B's with maximum a is exactly 2^{a-1}. Wait, but when a=1, {1} is the only set, and 2^{0}=1, which is correct. For a=2, the subsets are {} and {1}, so two sets: {2} and {1,2}, which is correct. For a=3, we have 4 sets: {3}, {1,3}, {2,3}, {1,2,3}. So yes, it's 2^{a-1} sets for each a.

Therefore, the total number of sets B is the sum over each a in A of 2^{a-1}.

So the total number of sets is sum_{a in A} 2^{a-1} = 2024.

So now, we need to find the set A such that the sum of 2^{a-1} for each a in A equals 2024. Then, the sum of the elements of A would be the sum of all a in A.

Wait, but how do we find A? Because A can be any set of positive integers whose corresponding 2^{a-1} sum to 2024. But since 2^{a-1} are powers of 2, this is similar to binary representation.

Wait, 2024 in binary is... let's compute that.

2024 divided by 2: 1012 rem 0

1012 /2=506 rem0

506/2=253 rem0

253/2=126 rem1

126/2=63 rem0

63/2=31 rem1

31/2=15 rem1

15/2=7 rem1

7/2=3 rem1

3/2=1 rem1

1/2=0 rem1

So writing the remainders from last to first: 1 1 1 1 1 0 1 0 0 0 0

Wait, let me count the steps:

1. 2024 ÷2=1012 rem 0

2. 1012 ÷2=506 rem 0

3. 506 ÷2=253 rem0

4. 253 ÷2=126 rem1

5. 126 ÷2=63 rem0

6. 63 ÷2=31 rem1

7. 31 ÷2=15 rem1

8. 15 ÷2=7 rem1

9. 7 ÷2=3 rem1

10. 3 ÷2=1 rem1

11. 1 ÷2=0 rem1

So the remainders from last to first are: 1 1 1 1 1 0 1 0 0 0 0.

Wait, count the number of digits: 11 digits. So 2024 is 11111101000 in binary.

Wait, let me verify:

Compute 1024 (2^10) + 512 (2^9) + 256 (2^8) + 128 (2^7) + 64 (2^6) + 16 (2^4) = 1024+512=1536, +256=1792, +128=1920, +64=1984, +16=2000. Wait, 2000 is less than 2024. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in binary.

Wait, let me check another way. 2^10=1024, 2^11=2048. 2024 is between 2^10 and 2^11.

2024 -1024=1000.

1000 in binary: 1024 is 2^10, but 1000 is less than that. 512 is 2^9. 1000-512=488.

488-256=232 (2^8). 232-128=104 (2^7). 104-64=40 (2^6). 40-32=8 (2^5). 8-8=0 (2^3). So 1000 is 512+256+128+64+32+8=512+256=768, +128=896, +64=960, +32=992, +8=1000.

So 1000 is 1111101000 in binary. So 2024 is 1024 + 1000, which in binary would be 1 followed by the binary of 1000. So 2024 is 11111101000 in binary.

Wait, let me check: 11111101000.

1*(2^10) +1*(2^9) +1*(2^8) +1*(2^7) +1*(2^6) +1*(2^5) +0*(2^4) +1*(2^3) +0*(2^2) +0*(2^1) +0*(2^0)

Which is 1024 + 512 + 256 + 128 + 64 + 32 + 8 = Let's compute:

1024 + 512 = 1536

1536 +256=1792

1792 +128=1920

1920 +64=1984

1984 +32=2016

2016 +8=2024. Yes, correct.

So 2024 in binary is 11111101000, which has 11 digits. So the binary representation has 1's at positions 10,9,8,7,6,5,3 (counting from 0 on the right). Wait, actually, the positions are from right to left, so the rightmost is 0.

Wait, no. Let's write it as bits:

From right to left: positions 0 to 10.

The binary is 11111101000.

So breaking down:

Position 10: 1

Position 9: 1

Position 8:1

Position7:1

Position6:1

Position5:1

Position4:0

Position3:1

Position2:0

Position1:0

Position0:0

So the 1s are at positions 10,9,8,7,6,5,3.

Which correspond to 2^10, 2^9, ..., 2^5, 2^3.

So, each 1 in the binary corresponds to a power of 2. But in our problem, the total number of sets is sum_{a in A} 2^{a-1} = 2024.

So 2024 = sum_{a in A} 2^{a-1}.

Which is the same as 2024 = sum_{a in A} 2^{a-1} = 2^{a1-1} + 2^{a2-1} + ... + 2^{ak-1}.

Given that 2024 is 2^10 + 2^9 + 2^8 + 2^7 + 2^6 + 2^5 + 2^3.

So, 2024 = 2^{11 - 1} + 2^{10 -1} + 2^{9 -1} + 2^{8 -1} + 2^{7 -1} + 2^{6 -1} + 2^{4 -1}.

Wait, wait, because 2^10 is 2^{11-1}, so 2^{a-1} = 2^10 implies a-1=10 => a=11.

Similarly, 2^{a-1}=2^9 => a=10, and so on.

So the exponents in 2024's binary representation are at positions where 2^{a-1} is present.

So looking back, 2024 in binary is 11111101000, which is 2^10 + 2^9 + 2^8 + 2^7 + 2^6 + 2^5 + 2^3.

So each of these terms is 2^{a-1}, so a-1 is 10,9,8,7,6,5,3. Therefore, a is 11,10,9,8,7,6,4.

So A is {4,6,7,8,9,10,11}.

Wait, but wait, let's check:

2^{11-1}=2^10=1024

2^{10-1}=2^9=512

2^{9-1}=2^8=256

2^{8-1}=2^7=128

2^{7-1}=2^6=64

2^{6-1}=2^5=32

2^{4-1}=2^3=8

Adding those: 1024 +512=1536; +256=1792; +128=1920; +64=1984; +32=2016; +8=2024. Correct.

So A is {4,6,7,8,9,10,11}.

Therefore, the sum of the elements of A is 4+6+7+8+9+10+11.

Let me compute that: 4+6=10; 10+7=17; 17+8=25; 25+9=34; 34+10=44; 44+11=55.

So the sum is 55.

So the answer is 55.


Alice chooses a set \( A \) of positive integers, and Bob lists all finite nonempty sets \( B \) where the maximum element of \( B \) is in \( A \). The number of such sets \( B \) is 2024. To find the sum of the elements of \( A \), we note that for each \( a \in A \), the number of sets \( B \) with maximum \( a \) is \( 2^{a-1} \). Thus, the total number of sets \( B \) is \( \sum_{a \in A} 2^{a-1} = 2024 \).

The binary representation of 2024 is \( 11111101000_2 \), which corresponds to the sum \( 2^{10} + 2^9 + 2^8 + 2^7 + 2^6 + 2^5 + 2^3 \). Each term \( 2^{a-1} \) implies \( a = 11, 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 4 \), respectively. Therefore, \( A = \{4, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11\} \).

The sum of the elements of \( A \) is \( 4 + 6 + 7 + 8 + 9 + 10 + 11 = 55 \).

\boxed{55}
