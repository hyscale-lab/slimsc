Okay, so I've got this problem here about b-eautiful numbers. Let me try to understand it step by step. 

The problem says: Given an integer b â‰¥ 2, a positive integer n is called b-eautiful if two conditions are met. First, when n is expressed in base b, it has exactly two digits. Second, the sum of these two digits equals the square root of n. 

Hmm, let me break this down. So, if a number n is in base b with two digits, that means it can be written as a * b + c, where a and c are the digits. Since it's a two-digit number in base b, the first digit a can't be zero; otherwise, it would be a single-digit number. So a must be at least 1, and c can be from 0 up to b-1 because it's a digit in base b.

The second condition is that the sum of the digits, a + c, equals the square root of n. So, we have a + c = sqrt(n). But since n is a * b + c, we can substitute that in. So:

a + c = sqrt(a * b + c)

That's the key equation we need to work with. Let me square both sides to eliminate the square root:

(a + c)^2 = a * b + c

Expanding the left side gives:

a^2 + 2ac + c^2 = a * b + c

Let me rearrange this equation to group like terms:

a^2 + 2ac + c^2 - a * b - c = 0

Hmm, maybe I can factor this or find a way to express it in terms of a and c. Let me see.

Alternatively, perhaps I can express b in terms of a and c. Let's try moving terms around:

a^2 + 2ac + c^2 = a*b + c

Subtract a*b and c from both sides:

a^2 + 2ac + c^2 - a*b - c = 0

Hmm, let's factor out a from some terms:

a^2 + a*(2c - b) + c^2 - c = 0

This is a quadratic in terms of a. Let me write it as:

a^2 + (2c - b)a + (c^2 - c) = 0

Now, for this quadratic equation to have integer solutions for a, the discriminant must be a perfect square. The discriminant D is:

D = (2c - b)^2 - 4 * 1 * (c^2 - c)

Let me compute that:

D = (4c^2 - 4bc + b^2) - 4c^2 + 4c
D = 4c^2 -4bc + b^2 -4c^2 +4c
D = (-4bc + b^2) +4c

Simplify:

D = b^2 -4b c +4c

Hmm, that's still a bit complicated. Maybe I can rearrange it:

D = b^2 + (-4c)b +4c

Wait, that's a quadratic in terms of b, but I'm not sure if that helps. Alternatively, perhaps factor out c from the last two terms.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think of this as:

D = (b^2) + (-4c)b +4c

But maybe that's not helpful. Alternatively, let's see if we can factor it differently.

Wait, D = b^2 -4b c +4c = b^2 -4c(b - 1)

Hmm, not sure if that helps immediately. Let me think about the discriminant needing to be a perfect square. So D must be a perfect square, say k^2, for some integer k.

So, we have:

b^2 -4b c +4c = k^2

Hmm, perhaps it's better to approach this problem by considering possible values of a and c, given that a and c are digits in base b.

Wait, since a is the first digit, it's between 1 and b-1, inclusive. And c is between 0 and b-1, inclusive.

So, for each base b, we can iterate over possible a and c values and check if the equation holds. But since we're looking for the least b where there are more than ten b-eautiful numbers, maybe we can find a way to express the number
