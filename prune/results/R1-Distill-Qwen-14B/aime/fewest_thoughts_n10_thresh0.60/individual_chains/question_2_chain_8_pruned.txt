Okay, so I need to solve this geometry problem. Let me read it again and try to understand each part.

We have points O at (0,0), A at (1/2, 0), and B at (0, sqrt(3)/2). So O is the origin, A is on the x-axis halfway between O and (1,0), and B is on the y-axis a bit less than (0,1), since sqrt(3)/2 is approximately 0.866.

The family F consists of segments PQ of unit length in the first quadrant. P is on the x-axis, Q is on the y-axis. So each PQ is a line segment from (p, 0) to (0, q), where p and q are positive numbers, right? And the length of PQ is 1. So, the distance from (p,0) to (0,q) is sqrt(p² + q²) = 1. Therefore, p² + q² = 1.

So, the family F is all such segments PQ where p² + q² = 1, with p and q positive. So, each PQ is a line segment from (p, 0) to (0, q), lying in the first quadrant, with p² + q² =1.

Then, the problem says there's a unique point C on AB, distinct from A and B, that does not belong to any segment from F other than AB. So, AB is one of these segments in F? Let me check: AB goes from A (1/2,0) to B (0, sqrt(3)/2). So, the length of AB is sqrt[(1/2)^2 + (sqrt(3)/2)^2] = sqrt[1/4 + 3/4] = sqrt(1) = 1. So AB is indeed a segment of unit length from the x-axis to the y-axis, so it's part of F.

Now, the point C is on AB, not being A or B, and it's the unique point on AB that is not on any other segment from F. So, for any other segment PQ in F, C is not on PQ. So, AB is the only segment in F that contains C.

We need to find OC², where O is the origin, and then express it as p/q with p and q coprime, and find p + q.

So, how do we approach this?

I think we can parametrize the line AB first. Let's figure out the equation of line AB.

Points A and B are at (1/2, 0) and (0, sqrt(3)/2). So, the slope of AB is (sqrt(3)/2 - 0)/(0 - 1/2) = (sqrt(3)/2)/(-1/2) = -sqrt(3). So, the equation of AB is y = -sqrt(3)x + b. Plugging in point A (1/2, 0): 0 = -sqrt(3)*(1/2) + b => b = sqrt(3)/2. So, equation is y = -sqrt(3)x + sqrt(3)/2.

So, any point C on AB can be written as (x, -sqrt(3)x + sqrt(3)/2). We can write this as (x, sqrt(3)(1/2 - x)).

We need to find the point C on AB such that C is not on any other segment PQ in F except AB. So, for any other PQ in F, C is not on PQ.

So, for any other PQ with endpoints (p,0) and (0,q), where p² + q² =1, the point C is not on PQ unless PQ is AB.

So, to find C, we need that for any other (p, q) with p² + q² =1, the point C does not lie on the line PQ, except when PQ is AB.

But wait, C is on AB. So, it's on AB, but not on any other PQ in F.

Alternatively, for any other segment PQ in F, C is not on PQ. So, for all other PQ in F, the point C is not on PQ.

So, if we consider the line PQ for any (p, q) with p² + q²=1, other than the line AB, then the point C is not on that line.

Wait, but maybe it's better to think in terms of parametric equations and find where C is the only intersection point with AB.

Alternatively, perhaps we can think about the envelope of the family F. The envelope is a curve that is tangent to each member of the family. If AB is part of F, then perhaps the envelope is the curve that just touches each PQ at one point, and C is the point where the envelope touches AB.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused. Let me think again.

Each PQ is a line segment from (p,0) to (0,q), with p² + q² =1. So, the line PQ can be expressed as (x/p) + (y/q) =1.

So, the equation is x/p + y/q =1, with p² + q²=1.

We can parametrize this family with p
