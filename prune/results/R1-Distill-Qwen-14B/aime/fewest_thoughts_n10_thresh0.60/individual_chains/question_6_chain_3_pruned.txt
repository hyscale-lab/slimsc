Okay, so I need to find the number of intersections between the graphs of y = 4g(f(sin(2πx))) and x = 4g(f(cos(3πy))). Hmm, that looks a bit complicated, but let me break it down step by step.

First, let's understand what the functions f(x) and g(x) are. The problem defines f(x) as ||x| - 1/2| and g(x) as ||x| - 1/4|. So both f and g are absolute value functions with some transformations. Maybe I should sketch these functions or at least understand their shapes and key points.

Let's start with f(x) = ||x| - 1/2|. The inner part is |x|, which is a V-shape with its vertex at (0,0). Then we subtract 1/2, so |x| - 1/2. This shifts the graph down by 1/2. But since it's inside another absolute value, we take the absolute value of that. So any negative parts of |x| - 1/2 will be flipped above.

So when is |x| - 1/2 negative? That happens when |x| < 1/2. So for x between -1/2 and 1/2, |x| - 1/2 is negative, and taking absolute value will flip it to positive. So the graph of f(x) will have a V-shape with its vertex at (0, 1/2) and then it will decrease on either side until it hits zero at x = ±1/2. Beyond x = ±1/2, the function behaves like |x| - 1/2, so it increases again.

Similarly, g(x) = ||x| - 1/4|. Let's analyze this. Again, starting with |x|, then subtracting 1/4. So for |x| < 1/4, this will be negative, and when we take absolute value, those parts will flip. So the vertex of g(x) is at (0, 1/4). The graph will have a V-shape with the bottom at 1/4, going up on both sides until it hits zero at x = ±1/4, and beyond that, it will follow |x| - 1/4.

Now, I need to consider the compositions. Let me think about f(sin(2πx)) first. Since sin(2πx) oscillates between -1 and 1, and f is applied to it. Similarly, cos(3πy) oscillates between -1 and 1, so g is applied to that.

But wait, f and g are both functions that take a number and return another number. So 4g(f(sin(2πx))) will be scaling the output of g(f(...)) by 4. Similarly, the other equation is x = 4g(f(cos(3πy))). So both equations involve these nested functions.

I think the key here is to first figure out the range of these functions, and then see how they can possibly intersect. Since the first equation gives y in terms of x, and the second gives x in terms of y, their intersections would be points (x, y) that satisfy both equations.

Let me break down the composition step by step. Let's start with f(sin(2πx)).

First, sin(2πx) is a sine wave with period 1, oscillating between -1 and 1. Then, f is applied to it, which is ||x| - 1/2|. So f(sin(2πx)) is ||sin(2πx)| - 1/2|.

Let me compute f(sin(2πx)):

1. Compute |sin(2πx)|: This is the absolute value of the sine function, so it's always non-negative and has a period of 1/2, oscillating between 0 and 1.

2. Subtract 1/2: So |sin(2πx)| - 1/2. This will be negative when |sin(2πx)| < 1/2, zero when |sin(2πx)| = 1/2, and positive when |sin(2πx)| > 1/2.

3. Then take absolute value: ||sin(2πx)| - 1/2|. So the negative parts will be flipped to positive.

So the graph of f(sin(2πx)) will have regions where it's 1/2 - |sin(2πx)| when |sin(2πx)| < 1/2, and |sin(2πx)| - 1/2 when |sin(2πx)| > 1/2.

Since |sin
