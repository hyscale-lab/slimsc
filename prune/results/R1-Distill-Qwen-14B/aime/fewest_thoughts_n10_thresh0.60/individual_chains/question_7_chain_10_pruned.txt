Okay, so I have this problem about coloring the vertices of a regular octagon either red or blue, each with a 50% chance. Then, I need to find the probability that the octagon can be rotated so that all the blue vertices end up where there were originally red vertices. The answer should be in the form m/n where m and n are coprime, and then find m + n.

Hmm, first, let me parse the problem correctly. Each vertex is colored red or blue independently with equal probability. So each vertex has a 1/2 chance of being red or blue, and the colors are independent across vertices.

The key part is the probability that the octagon can be rotated so that all blue vertices end up where there were originally red vertices. So, after some rotation, every blue vertex moves to a position that was previously red.

Wait, so the octagon has rotational symmetry. Let me think. A regular octagon can be rotated by multiples of 45 degrees (since 360/8 = 45). So, the rotation group is cyclic of order 8. That is, there are 8 possible rotations: 0°, 45°, 90°, ..., 315°, corresponding to rotations by 0, 1, 2, ..., 7 steps (each step being 45°).

For a coloring, we can apply one of these rotations, and we want that after rotation, every blue vertex is now on a position that was originally red. So, in other words, for each blue vertex in the original coloring, after rotation by some k steps, it's now on a red vertex of the original coloring.

Alternatively, this can be rephrased: for some rotation k, the set of blue vertices is a subset of the red vertices after rotation by k. Wait, no, more precisely, for some rotation, the image of the blue vertices under rotation is exactly the set of red vertices.

Wait, no. Wait, maybe. Let me think again.

Suppose the original coloring has some blue and red vertices. We are to find a rotation such that when we rotate the octagon by some k steps, all the blue vertices move to positions that were originally red. So, for each blue vertex in the original coloring, when we rotate it by k steps, it lands on a red vertex.

But the red and blue vertices are fixed. The octagon is fixed in space, but we can rotate it
