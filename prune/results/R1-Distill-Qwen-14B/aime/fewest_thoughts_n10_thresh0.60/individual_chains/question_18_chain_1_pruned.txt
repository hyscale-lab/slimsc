Okay, so I need to find the number of rectangles that can be formed inside a fixed regular dodecagon (12-gon) where each side of the rectangle lies on either a side or a diagonal of the dodecagon. Hmm, that sounds a bit tricky, but let me try to break it down.

First, a regular dodecagon has 12 sides, all equal in length, and all internal angles equal. Each internal angle in a regular dodecagon is 150 degrees, right? But maybe that's not directly relevant here.

So, the problem is about forming rectangles whose sides are either sides or diagonals of the dodecagon. I guess that means each side of the rectangle must align with an edge or a diagonal of the dodecagon. So, the rectangles are formed by connecting these edges or diagonals.

I remember that in regular polygons, especially those with an even number of sides, it's possible to form rectangles by selecting pairs of parallel sides or diagonals. Since a dodecagon is 12-sided, which is even, it should have multiple pairs of parallel sides and diagonals.

Wait, but how exactly do these rectangles form? I think each rectangle is determined by choosing two pairs of parallel lines (sides or diagonals) that intersect each other inside the dodecagon. The intersection points would be the vertices of the rectangle.

So, perhaps the key is to count how many such pairs of parallel lines exist in the dodecagon and then figure out how many rectangles can be formed by their intersections.

Let me think about the structure of a regular dodecagon. Each vertex is connected to others by sides and diagonals. The length of a diagonal depends on how many vertices it skips. For example, in a dodecagon, a diagonal can connect to the next vertex (which is a side), then the next (a short diagonal), and so on.

But wait, in a regular dodecagon, sides are just the edges, and diagonals can be of different lengths, depending on how many vertices they skip. Since the polygon is regular, diagonals that skip the same number of vertices are congruent and parallel.

So, perhaps the first step is to figure out how many distinct directions (slopes) the sides and diagonals can take. In a regular polygon with n sides, the number of distinct directions is n/2 because each direction has a parallel opposite direction. Since a dodecagon has 12 sides, it should have 6 distinct directions of sides and diagonals.

Wait, let me confirm that. For a regular polygon with an even number of sides, n=12, the number of distinct directions is n/2=6. So, each direction corresponds to a 'step' between vertices. For example, step 1 is the side, step 2 skips one vertex, step 3 skips two, and so on, up to step 5, because step 6 would connect vertices directly opposite, which is the longest diagonal. Hmm, but wait, step 6 would connect diametrically opposite points, so that's also a diagonal
