Okay, so I've got this problem here: Let ω ≠ 1 be a 13th root of unity. I need to find the remainder when the product from k=0 to 12 of (2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k}) is divided by 1000. Hmm, okay.

First, I remember that roots of unity have some nice properties. Since ω is a 13th root of unity, ω^13 = 1, and ω^k for k=0 to 12 are all distinct. Also, the minimal polynomial for ω over the rationals is the 13th cyclotomic polynomial, which is Φ₁₃(x) = x¹² + x¹¹ + ... + x + 1. But I'm not sure yet how that connects.

The expression I'm supposed to compute is the product for each k from 0 to 12 of (2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k}). Let me write that out:

Product = ∏_{k=0}^{12} (2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k})

Hmm, maybe I can factor this expression somehow. Let me look at each term.

Each term is 2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k}. Let's think about that. Maybe factor out a common term or see if it's a quadratic in ω^k. Let's see:

Let me set x = ω^k. Then each term becomes 2 - 2x + x². So the expression is x² - 2x + 2. Hmm, let's factor that or see if it's a known polynomial.

Wait, x² - 2x + 2 can be rewritten as (x² - 2x +1) +1 = (x-1)^2 +1. Not sure if that helps, but maybe.

Alternatively, perhaps I can factor this quadratic. Let me see if it factors over the complex numbers. The discriminant is 4 - 8 = -4, so the roots are [2 ± sqrt(-4)]/2 = 1 ± i. So, x² - 2x +2 factors as (x - (1 + i))(x - (1 - i)). So each term can be written as (ω^k - (1 + i))(ω^k - (1 - i)).

So, the product becomes ∏_{k=0}^{12} (ω^k - (1 + i))(ω^k - (1 - i)) = [∏_{k=0}^{12} (ω^k - (1 + i))] * [∏_{k=0}^{12} (ω^k - (1 - i))]

Now, I remember that for cyclotomic polynomials, the product of (x - ω^k) for k=0 to 12 is x¹³ -1, because ω is a primitive 13th root. But wait, when k=0, ω^0 =1, so the product is (x -1)(x - ω)(x - ω²)...(x - ω¹²) = x¹³ -1.

But in our case, the product is over (ω^k - a) for a fixed a. So, if I let a = 1 + i or a =1 -i, then ∏_{k=0}^{12} (ω^k - a) would be something. Wait, more precisely, since ω^k are the roots of x¹³ -1 =0, except for x=1. But when k=0, ω^0=1, so the product includes (1 - a) as a factor.

Wait, so ∏_{k=0}^{12} (ω^k - a) = (a¹³ -1). Because if you plug x = a into the product (x - ω^0)(x - ω)(x - ω
