Okay, so I have this problem about rectangular boxes with a surface area of 54 and a volume of 23. I need to find the radius of the smallest sphere that can contain each of these boxes. Then, I have to express r squared as a fraction p/q where p and q are coprime, and find p+q.

Hmm. Let me try to break this down. First, let's recall that the smallest sphere that can contain a rectangular box will have a diameter equal to the space diagonal of the box. So, the radius r will be half of that space diagonal. The space diagonal d of a rectangular box with side lengths a, b, c is given by the formula d = sqrt(a² + b² + c²). Therefore, r = (1/2) * sqrt(a² + b² + c²), so r² = (a² + b² + c²)/4.

So, to find r², I need to minimize (a² + b² + c²), given the constraints on surface area and volume. That makes sense. So, the problem reduces to minimizing a² + b² + c² given that the surface area is 54 and the volume is 23.

Let me write down the constraints:

1. Surface area: 2(ab + bc + ac) = 54
2. Volume: abc = 23

I need to minimize a² + b² + c².

Hmm, this seems like an optimization problem with constraints. Maybe I can use Lagrange multipliers or some substitution to solve it.

Alternatively, I remember that for symmetric functions, sometimes the minimum occurs when variables are equal, but in this case, the volume is 23, which is a prime number, so it's unlikely that a, b, c are equal. So, perhaps I should approach this systematically.

Let me denote S = a + b + c, P = ab + bc + ac, and Q = abc. Then, from the surface area, 2P = 54, so P = 27. And the volume is Q = 23.

We also know that a² + b² + c² = S² - 2P. So, a² + b² + c² = S² - 54. So, to minimize a² + b² + c², we need to minimize S², since 54 is a constant.

So, if I can find the minimum value of S, then I can find the minimum value of a² + b² + c².

But wait, how do I relate S and P and Q? Maybe I can use inequalities or optimization techniques.

Alternatively, perhaps I can express a² + b² + c² in terms of P and S, and find its minimum.

Wait, but let me think about how to minimize a² + b² + c² given that 2(ab + bc + ac) = 54 and abc = 23.

Let me consider using the method of Lagrange multipliers. Let me set up the function to minimize.

Let’s define f(a,b,c) = a² + b² + c²

Subject to constraints:

g(a,b,c) = 2(ab + bc + ac) - 54 = 0

h(a,b,c) = abc - 23 = 0

So, we need to find the minimum of f(a,b,c) with g=0 and h=0.

Using Lagrange multipliers, we can set up the system:

∇f = λ∇g + μ∇h

So, compute the gradients:

∇f = (2a, 2b, 2c)

∇g = (2(b + c), 2(a + c), 2(a + b))

∇h = (bc, ac, ab)

So, the system is:

2a = λ*2(b + c) + μ*bc     (1)

2b = λ*2(a + c) + μ*ac     (2)

2c = λ*2(a + b) + μ*ab     (3)

And we have the constraints:

2(ab + bc + ac) = 54       (4)

abc = 23                   (5)

Hmm, okay, so we have four equations (1-5) and four variables: a, b, c, and λ, μ.

This seems a bit complicated, but maybe we can find some symmetry or relations between a, b, c.

Let me subtract equation (1) from equation (2). So:

2b - 2a = λ*2(a + c - b - c) + μ(bc - ab)

Simplify:

2(b - a) = λ*2(a - b) + μ b(c - a)

Factor out (b - a):

2(b - a) = -2λ(b - a) + μ b (c - a)

Assuming that a ≠ b, we can divide both sides by (b - a):

2 = -2λ + μ b (c - a)/(b - a)

Wait, this might not be the easiest path. Alternatively, maybe we can assume that two variables are equal, which might reduce the complexity.

Suppose that a = b. Then, let's see if this assumption leads us somewhere.

If a = b, then from the constraints:

Surface area: 2(ab + bc + ac) = 2(a² + 2ac) = 54 → a² + 2ac = 27.

Volume: a^2 c = 23.

So, let me solve for c from the volume equation: c = 23 / (a²)

Substitute into the surface area equation:

a² + 2a*(23 / a²) = 27 → a² + (46 / a) = 27

Multiply both sides by a:

a³ + 46 = 27 a → a³ - 27 a + 46 = 0

Let me try to find a real root here. Maybe trying small integer values:

a=1: 1 -27 +46=20≠0

a=2:8 -54 +46=0 → a=2 is a root.

So, (a - 2) is a factor. Let's factor the polynomial:

a³ -27a +46 = (a -2)(a² + 2a -23)

Set equal to zero: (a -2)(a² + 2a -23)=0.

Solutions are a=2, and a=(-2 ± sqrt(4 + 92))/2 = (-2 ± sqrt(96))/2 = (-2 ± 4*sqrt(6))/2 = -1 ± 2√6.

Since a is positive (length), we have a=2, and a=-1 + 2√6 ≈-1 +4.898≈3.898.

So, possible a=2, then c=23/(a²)=23/4=5.75.

So, when a=b=2, c=5.75.

Let me check if this gives a valid box.

Surface area: 2(ab + bc + ac) = 2*(4 + 11.5 + 11.5)= 2*(27)=54. Correct.

Volume: 2*2*5.75=23. Correct.

So, this is a valid box.

Now, let's compute a² + b² + c²: 4 +4 + (5.75)^2= 8 + 33.0625=41.0625.

So, r²=41.0625 /4=10.265625.

But is this the minimum? Or is there a smaller a² + b² +c² when the variables are not equal?

Wait, when a=b, we found a solution, but perhaps the minimal a² + b² +c² occurs when a≠b. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe the minimal is when all variables are equal, but since volume is 23, which is not a cube number, that's unlikely.

Wait, let me compute a² + b² +c² when a=b=2, c=5.75.

As above, it's 4 +4 + (23/4)^2=8 + (529/16)=8 + 33.0625=41.0625.

But maybe if we have different a, b, c, we can get a smaller a² +b² +c².

Wait, let me think. If a box is more cube-like, then the space diagonal is minimized for a given volume, but
