Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the least prime number p such that there's a positive integer n where n^4 + 1 is divisible by p squared. Then, I have to find the least positive integer m where m^4 + 1 is divisible by p squared.

Hmm, let me break this down. First, I need to find the smallest prime p where p² divides some n^4 + 1. Then, once I find that p, I need to find the smallest m such that m^4 + 1 is divisible by p².

I remember that primes where -1 is a quartic residue modulo p might be relevant here. A quartic residue is a number that's a fourth power modulo p. So, if -1 is a quartic residue mod p, then there exists some number x such that x^4 ≡ -1 mod p. But wait, the problem is about p² dividing n^4 +1, which is a stronger condition.

I think this relates to higher-order congruences. Maybe Hensel's lemma could help here, which is used to lift solutions from modulo p to modulo higher powers like p².

Let me consider small primes first. Let's list the primes in order: 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, etc.

Starting with p=2. Let's see if there's an n such that n^4 +1 is divisible by 2²=4. n can be 1: 1^4 +1=2, which isn't divisible by 4. n=2: 16 +1=17, which mod 4 is 1. n=3: 81 +1=82, which mod 4 is 2. Hmm, not working. Maybe p=2 isn't possible because n^4 is always 0 or 1 mod 2, so n^4 +1 is always 1 mod 2. So 2²=4 can't divide it. So p=2 is out.

Next, p=3. Let's check if there's an n with n^4 ≡ -1 mod 9.

Compute n^4 mod 9 for n=1 to 8 (since mod 9 repeats every 9 numbers).

1^4=1 mod9
2^4=16≡7 mod
