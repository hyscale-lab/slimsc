Okay, so I have this geometry problem here. It says that in triangle ABC, the circumcenter is O and the incenter is I. They give me that IA is perpendicular to OI, the circumradius is 13, and the inradius is 6. I need to find AB times AC. Hmm, okay, let's break this down step by step.

First, I remember that the circumradius R is related to the sides of the triangle and its area. The formula is R = (a*b*c)/(4*Δ), where a, b, c are the sides and Δ is the area. But I don't know the sides yet, so maybe I need another approach.

The inradius r is given as 6. I also remember that r = Δ/s, where s is the semiperimeter. So Δ = r*s. If I can find s, I can find the area, and maybe that will help me find AB*AC.

Wait, the problem also mentions that IA is perpendicular to OI. That seems important. IA is the segment from the incenter to vertex A, and OI is the segment connecting the incenter and circumcenter. So IA ⊥ OI.

I think there's a formula or relation involving the distances between incenter and circumcenter. Let me recall. The distance between the incenter and circumcenter is given by OI² = R(R - 2r). Let me verify that. Yes, I think that's correct. So OI² = R(R - 2r). Plugging in R=13 and r=6, we get OI² = 13*(13 - 12) = 13*1 =13. So OI = sqrt(13).

Okay, so OI is sqrt(13). Now, IA is perpendicular to OI. So in triangle IOA, IA is perpendicular to OI. So triangle IOA is a right triangle with right angle at I.

Wait, is that correct? IA is the segment from I to A, but O is the circumradius. So point O is the circumcenter, so OA is the circumradius, which is 13. So in triangle IOA, we have OA = 13, OI = sqrt(13), and IA is the other side.

Since triangle IOA is right-angled at I, by the Pythagorean theorem: IA² + OI² = OA².

So IA² + 13 = 13². So IA² = 169 -13 = 156. Therefore, IA = sqrt(156) = 2*sqrt(39).

Hmm, okay. Now, IA is the length from the inradius to vertex A, so maybe I can relate that to the sides of the triangle.

I recall that the distance from the incenter to a vertex can be expressed in terms of the sides and angles. The formula for IA is (r)/sin(A/2). Wait, yes, IA = r / sin(A/2). So IA = 6 / sin(A/2) = 2*sqrt(39). Therefore, sin(A/2) = 6/(2*sqrt(39)) ) = 3/sqrt(39) = sqrt(39)/13. Wait, let me compute that correctly: 6/(2√39) is 3/√39, which can be rationalized as (3√39)/39 = √39/13. So sin(A/2) = √39/13.

Now, since sin(A/2) is known, I can find cos(A/2) using the identity sin²x + cos²x =1. So cos²(A/2) = 1 - (39/169) = (169-39)/169 =130/169. Therefore, cos(A/2) = sqrt(130)/13.

Now, I think the formula for the distance from the incenter to vertex A is IA = r / sin(A/2), which we've used. Another formula that might come in handy is the formula for the length of the side BC. I remember that BC = 2r / sin(A/2). Wait, no, that's not right. Let me think. Alternatively, since I know sin(A/2) and cos(A/2), perhaps I can find other trigonometric functions.

Wait, another approach: In triangle ABC, the sides can be related to the angles and the inradius and circumradius. Let me recall the formula for the area Δ. The area can be expressed as r*s, where s is the semiperimeter, and also as (a*b*c)/(4R). So, Δ = r*s = (a*b*c)/(4R). Given that R=13 and r=
