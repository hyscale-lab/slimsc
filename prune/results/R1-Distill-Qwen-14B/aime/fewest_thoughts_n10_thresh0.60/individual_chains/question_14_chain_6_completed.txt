Alright, so I've got this problem here about finding the greatest four-digit number, N, such that if you change any one of its digits to 1, the resulting number is divisible by 7. Then, I need to find Q + R where Q is the quotient and R is the remainder when N is divided by 1000.

Let me break this down. First, N is a four-digit number, so it's between 1000 and 9999. I need to find the largest such number. Then, when any one digit is changed to 1, the new number is divisible by 7.

Hmm, okay. Let's think about what that means. So, for N, which is a four-digit number, say N = ABCD where A, B, C, D are its digits, changing any one digit to 1 gives a number divisible by 7. So, changing A to 1 gives a number divisible by 7, changing B to 1 gives another number divisible by 7, same with C and D.

So, each of these modified numbers must be divisible by 7. That gives us four conditions. Let's write them out.

If N is ABCD, then:

1. Changing A to 1: 1BCD must be divisible by 7.
2. Changing B to 1: A1CD must be divisible by 7.
3. Changing C to 1: AB1D must be divisible by 7.
4. Changing D to 1: ABC1 must be divisible by 7.

Each of these four numbers must be divisible by 7.

Now, since we're looking for the greatest four-digit number, we want to maximize N. So, we should try to make N as large as possible, starting from 9999 and going down, checking each number to see if it satisfies these four conditions.

But wait, that might take too long. Maybe there's a smarter way.

Let me think about the properties of numbers divisible by 7. 7 is a prime number, so divisibility rules for 7 aren't as straightforward as some others. The standard test is to double the last digit, subtract it from the rest, and see if the result is divisible by 7. But that might not be too helpful here.

Alternatively, since we're dealing with numbers where changing a digit gives a multiple of 7, maybe we can express each modified number in terms of N and the digit changed.

Let me denote:

N = 1000*A + 100*B + 10*C + D.

When we change a digit to 1, say the thousands digit, A becomes 1:

Modified number = 1000*1 + 100*B + 10*C + D = 1000 + 100*B + 10*C + D.

Similarly, changing the hundreds digit to 1:

Modified number = 1000*A + 100*1 + 10*C + D = 1000*A + 100 + 10*C + D.

Same for tens and units digits.

So, each modified number can be written as N - (digit changed)*place_value + 1*place_value.

Wait, maybe it's easier to express each modified number as N plus some delta.

Let me formalize this.

Changing the thousands digit from A to 1:

Modified number = 1000*1 + 100*B + 10*C + D = 1000 + 100*B + 10*C + D.

But N = 1000*A + 100*B + 10*C + D. So the modified number is N - 1000*(A - 1).

Similarly, changing the hundreds digit:

Modified number = 1000*A + 100*1 + 10*C + D = 1000*A + 100 + 10*C + D.

Which is N - 100*(B - 1).

Wait, that's correct because N has 100*B in it, so subtracting 100*(B - 1) would set it to 100*1.

Similarly, changing the tens digit:

Modified number = 1000*A + 100*B + 10*1 + D = 1000*A + 100*B + 10 + D.

Which is N - 10*(C - 1).

And changing the units digit:

Modified number = 1000*A + 100*B + 10*C + 1 = N - (D - 1).

So, each modified number can be expressed as N - (digit - 1)*place_value.

But since these modified numbers are all divisible by 7, we can write:

1. 1BCD = N - (A - 1)*1000 ≡ 0 mod 7
2. A1CD = N - (B - 1)*100 ≡ 0 mod 7
3. AB1D = N - (C - 1)*10 ≡ 0 mod 7
4. ABC1 = N - (D - 1)*1 ≡ 0 mod 7

So, each modified number is congruent to 0 mod 7. That gives us four congruence equations:

1. N ≡ (A - 1)*1000 mod 7
2. N ≡ (B - 1)*100 mod 7
3. N ≡ (C - 1)*10 mod 7
4. N ≡ (D - 1)*1 mod 7

Wait, perhaps I should rephrase that. Since the modified number is equal to N - (digit - 1)*place_value, and that must be ≡ 0 mod 7, so:

N - (digit - 1)*place_value ≡ 0 mod 7 → N ≡ (digit - 1)*place_value mod 7.

So for each digit:

1. N ≡ (A - 1)*1000 mod 7
2. N ≡ (B - 1)*100 mod 7
3. N ≡ (C - 1)*10 mod 7
4. N ≡ (D - 1)*1 mod 7

So, all four of these expressions must be congruent to N mod 7. Which suggests that all four are congruent to each other mod 7.

So, (A - 1)*1000 ≡ (B - 1)*100 mod 7.

Similarly, (B - 1)*100 ≡ (C - 1)*10 mod 7, and so on.

Let me compute the place_values mod 7.

1000 mod 7: Let's see, 7*142=994, so 1000 - 994=6 → 1000 ≡6 mod7.
Similarly, 100 mod7: 7*14=98 → 100-98=2 → 100≡2 mod7.
10 mod7=3.
1 mod7=1.

So, the place_values mod7 are:

- Thousands: 6
- Hundreds: 2
- Tens: 3
- Units: 1.

So, the four congruence equations become:

1. N ≡ (A - 1)*6 mod7
2. N ≡ (B - 1)*2 mod7
3. N ≡ (C - 1)*3 mod7
4. N ≡ (D - 1)*1 mod7

And all four are equal to N mod7, which is the same for each equation.

Thus, each of these expressions must be equal mod7.

So, (A - 1)*6 ≡ (B - 1)*2 mod7.

Similarly, (B - 1)*2 ≡ (C - 1)*3 mod7.

And (C - 1)*3 ≡ (D - 1)*1 mod7.

So, these give equations between the digits.

Let me denote:

Let’s define variables:

Let’s set x = (A - 1), y = (B - 1), z = (C - 1), w = (D - 1).

So, the equations become:

1. x*6 ≡ y*2 mod7
2. y*2 ≡ z*3 mod7
3. z*3 ≡ w*1 mod7

So, we have a chain of congruences:

Equation 1: 6x ≡ 2y mod7 → 6x -2y ≡0 mod7 → 3x - y ≡0 mod7 (divided both sides by 2, since 2 and 7 are coprime).

Equation 2: 2y ≡3z mod7.

Equation 3: 3z ≡w mod7.

So, from Equation1: y ≡3x mod7.

From Equation2: 2y ≡3z mod7. Substitute y=3x:

2*(3x) ≡3z →6x≡3z mod7. Divide both sides by 3 (since 3 and 7 are coprime):

2x ≡ z mod7.

From Equation3: 3z ≡w mod7. Substitute z=2x:

3*(2x) ≡w →6x≡w mod7.

So, now we have:

y ≡3x mod7,

z≡2x mod7,

w≡6x mod7.

So, all variables y, z, w are expressed in terms of x.

Now, since x, y, z, w are digits that are (digits minus 1). So, x = A-1, so A = x +1. Similarly, B = y +1, C = z +1, D = w +1.

But A, B, C, D are digits, so their values are between 0 and 9 (since it's a four-digit number, A can be from 1 to 9, others from 0 to 9).

So, x = A -1: x can be from 0 (if A=1) to 8 (if A=9).

Similarly, y = B -1: y from -1 to 8? Wait, no, B is a digit from 0 to9, so y = B-1 is from -1 to8. But wait, in our congruences, we have y ≡3x mod7. Since x can be 0 to8, 3x can be 0 to24. So y can be negative, but mod7, y can be in 0 to6.

Wait, but y is B-1, which is an integer from -1 to8.

But in our equations, y is expressed as 3x mod7, which is an integer between 0 and6 since mod7.

So, y must be equal to 3x mod7, but y is B-1.

Which suggests that 3x mod7 must be in the range [ -1, 8 ].

But 3x mod7 is in [0,6], so y must be equal to 3x mod7, which is in [0,6], but since y = B-1 can be from -1 to8, that's acceptable because y can be 0-6, but also 7-8 or -1.

Wait, maybe not. Let me think.

Wait, if y must be equal to 3x mod7, but y is in the range -1 to8.

But 3x mod7 is always between 0 and6. So y must be between 0 and6, meaning that B-1 is between 0 and6, so B is between1 and7.

Wait, but B can be from0 to9, but if y = B-1 must equal 3x mod7, which is in 0-6, then B can be from1 to7. So, B can't be 0,8,9? Or can it?

Wait, no, because y can be negative. For example, if 3x mod7 is 0, then y=0, so B=1.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think about x, which is A-1, so x can be 0 to8.

Given that x is 0-8, let's see what 3x mod7 is for x from0 to8:

x | 3x | 3x mod7
0 | 0  | 0
1 |3   |3
2 |6   |6
3 |9   |2
4 |12  |5
5 |15  |1
6 |18  |4
7 |21  |0
8 |24  |3

So, 3x mod7 cycles through 0,3,6,2,5,1,4,0,3 as x increases from 0 to8.

So, y must be equal to 3x mod7. So, for each x, y is determined.

Then, z = 2x mod7.

Similarly, let's compute 2x mod7 for x=0-8:

x | 2x | 2x mod7
0 |0   |0
1 |2   |2
2 |4   |4
3 |6   |6
4 |8   |1
5 |10  |3
6 |12  |5
7 |14  |0
8 |16  |2

So, z = 2x mod7.

Similarly, w =6x mod7:

x |6x |6x mod7
0 |0  |0
1 |6  |6
2 |12 |5
3 |18 |4
4 |24 |3
5 |30 |2
6 |36 |1
7 |42 |0
8 |48 |6

So, w =6x mod7.

Now, since y =3x mod7, and y must be equal to B-1, which is in the range [ -1,8 ].

But from the above table, y can be 0,3,6,2,5,1,4,0,3 for x=0-8.

So, y must be in [0,6], because 3x mod7 is 0-6.

Thus, B = y +1, so B can be 1,4,7,3,6,2,5,1,4.

Wait, let me see:

For each x (0-8), y =3x mod7:

x=0 → y=0 → B=1
x=1 → y=3 → B=4
x=2 → y=6 → B=7
x=3 → y=2 → B=3
x=4 → y=5 → B=6
x=5 → y=1 → B=2
x=6 → y=4 → B=5
x=7 → y=0 → B=1
x=8 → y=3 → B=4

So, B can be 1,4,7,3,6,2,5,1,4 depending on x.

So, B is determined by x, and so are C and D.

Since we want N to be as large as possible, we should choose the largest possible A, then B, then C, then D.

So, let's try to maximize N=ABCD by choosing the largest possible A, then B, and so on.

A is x+1, so x can be 0-8.

Since we want A as large as possible, x should be as large as possible, i.e., x=8, which gives A=9.

So, let's set x=8.

Then, y=3x mod7=3*8=24 mod7=3. So B=y+1=4.

z=2x mod7=2*8=16 mod7=2. So C=z+1=3.

w=6x mod7=6*8=48 mod7=6. So D=w+1=7.

So, N would be A=9, B=4, C=3, D=7 → 9437.

But wait, let's check if this N=9437 satisfies the original condition: changing any digit to 1 gives a number divisible by7.

Let me check each modified number.

1. Change A to1: 1437. Check if divisible by7.

1437 ÷7: 7*205=1435. 1437-1435=2. Not divisible by7. So, 1437 mod7=2. Not 0. So, this N=9437 doesn't satisfy the condition.

Hmm, that's a problem. So, maybe x=8 is not suitable. Let's try the next lower x.

x=7: A=8.

y=3*7=21 mod7=0 → B=1.

z=2*7=14 mod7=0 → C=1.

w=6*7=42 mod7=0 → D=1.

So, N=8111.

Check if this satisfies the condition.

Changing any digit to 1: Well, all digits except the first are already 1. So, changing A to1: 1111. 1111 ÷7=158.714… Not an integer. 1111 mod7: 7*158=1106, 1111-1106=5. Not divisible.

So N=8111 doesn't work.

Hmm, so x=7 gives N=8111 which doesn't satisfy the condition. So, x=7 is invalid.

x=6: A=7.

y=3*6=18 mod7=4 → B=5.

z=2*6=12 mod7=5 → C=6.

w=6*6=36 mod7=1 → D=2.

So, N=7562.

Check the modified numbers:

1. Change A to1: 1562. Check if divisible by7.

1562 ÷7: 7*223=1561. 1562-1561=1. Not divisible.

So, 1562 mod7=1. Not 0. So, N=7562 doesn't work.

x=5: A=6.

y=3*5=15 mod7=1 → B=2.

z=2*5=10 mod7=3 → C=4.

w=6*5=30 mod7=2 → D=3.

N=6243.

Check modified numbers:

Change A to1: 1243. 1243 ÷7=177.571... Not integer.

1243 ÷7: 7*177=1239. 1243-1239=4. Not divisible. So, N=6243 doesn't work.

x=4: A=5.

y=3*4=12 mod7=5 → B=6.

z=2*4=8 mod7=1 → C=2.

w=6*4=24 mod7=3 → D=4.

N=5624.

Check modified numbers:

Change A to1: 1624. 1624 ÷7=232. So, 232*7=1624. Yes, divisible by7.

Change B to1: 5124. 5124 ÷7: 7*732=5124. Exactly. So, divisible.

Change C to1: 5614. 5614 ÷7: 7*802=5614. Yes.

Change D to1: 5621. 5621 ÷7: Let's calculate. 7*803=5621. Yes, exactly.

So, N=5624 passes all four conditions.

Wait, that's a valid N=5624. But we're looking for the greatest four-digit N, so perhaps there exists a higher N.

Wait, but when x=8, we got N=9437 which didn't satisfy the condition. x=7:8111 didn't satisfy, x=6:7562 didn't, x=5:6243 didn't, x=4:5624 did. So, x=4 is the next possible candidate.

Wait, perhaps I missed something. Let me check x=3, maybe we can get a higher N.

x=3: A=4.

y=3*3=9 mod7=2 → B=3.

z=2*3=6 mod7=6 → C=7.

w=6*3=18 mod7=4 → D=5.

So, N=4375.

Check modified numbers:

Change A to1:1375. 1375 ÷7=196.428... Not integer. 1375-7*196=1375-1372=3. Not divisible.

So, N=4375 doesn't work.

x=2: A=3.

y=3*2=6 mod7=6 → B=7.

z=2*2=4 mod7=4 → C=5.

w=6*2=12 mod7=5 → D=6.

N=3756.

Check modified numbers:

Change A to1:1756. 1756 ÷7=250.857... Not integer. 1756-7*250=1756-1750=6. Not divisible.

So, N=3756 doesn't work.

x=1: A=2.

y=3*1=3 mod7=3 → B=4.

z=2*1=2 mod7=2 → C=3.

w=6*1=6 mod7=6 → D=7.

N=2437.

Check modified numbers:

Change A to1:1437. 1437 ÷7=205.285... Not integer. 1437-7*205=1437-1435=2. Not divisible.

So, N=2437 doesn't work.

x=0: A=1.

y=3*0=0 mod7=0 → B=1.

z=2*0=0 mod7=0 → C=1.

w=6*0=0 mod7=0 → D=1.

N=1111.

Changing A to1:1111, which is the same. 1111 ÷7=158.714... Not integer. So, doesn't work.

So, from x=0 to x=8, only x=4 gives a valid N=5624. But wait, earlier I thought x=8 gives N=9437 which didn't satisfy, but what about other x's between 4 and8?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the approach. Maybe there's a higher N than 5624 that satisfies the condition.

Wait, perhaps I should try other x's in the 5-8 range and see if any N satisfies all four conditions.

Wait, but when x=8, N=9437 didn't work. x=7:8111 didn't work. x=6:7562 didn't work. x=5:6243 didn't work. So, the first valid N we found was at x=4, N=5624.

But maybe there's a higher N beyond x=4 that I missed because of some flaw in my logic.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the congruences must hold, but perhaps for some x, the digits B, C, D go beyond their limits (i.e., 0-9). So, in the case of x=8, we have:

y=3x mod7=3*8=24 mod7=3 → B=y+1=4, which is acceptable.

z=2x mod7=16 mod7=2 → C=z+1=3.

w=6x mod7=48 mod7=6 → D=w+1=7.

So, N=9437. But when I checked, changing A to1 gives 1437, which isn't divisible by7.

Hmm, so maybe there's no higher N than 5624 that satisfies the condition. But let me think again.

Wait, perhaps I can try to find a higher N by allowing some of the digits to be larger, but not necessarily following the x=4 approach.

Alternatively, maybe there's a different way to approach this problem.

Let me think differently. Since changing any digit to1 gives a multiple of7, then for each digit position, N must be such that when that digit is set to1, the number is divisible by7.

Let me denote the four modified numbers as:

N1 = 1BCD

N2 = A1CD

N3 = AB1D

N4 = ABC1

Each of these must be divisible by7.

So, N must satisfy:

1BCD ≡0 mod7

A1CD ≡0 mod7

AB1D ≡0 mod7

ABC1 ≡0 mod7

So, these are four separate conditions.

But perhaps I can model this as N must be such that when any digit is replaced by1, the number is divisible by7.

An alternative approach: Let me think about the original number N. Let me represent N as:

N = 1000A + 100B + 10C + D.

When I change A to1, N1 = 1000 + 100B + 10C + D.

Similarly, N1 = N - 1000(A -1).

So, N1 = N - 1000(A-1).

Since N1 is divisible by7, we have:

N ≡ 1000(A -1) mod7.

But 1000 mod7=6, as before. So, N ≡6*(A-1) mod7.

Similarly, when changing B to1, N2 = A*1000 + 100 + 10C + D.

Which is N2 = N - 100*(B -1).

Thus, N ≡ 100*(B -1) mod7. Since 100 mod7=2, this becomes N ≡2*(B-1) mod7.

Similarly, N3 = N -10*(C -1), so N ≡10*(C -1) mod7. 10 mod7=3. So, N ≡3*(C -1) mod7.

N4 = N - (D -1), so N ≡(D -1)*1 mod7.

So, we have four congruence equations:

1. N ≡6*(A-1) mod7.

2. N ≡2*(B-1) mod7.

3. N ≡3*(C-1) mod7.

4. N ≡(D-1) mod7.

So, all four expressions are equal to N mod7. Therefore:

6*(A-1) ≡2*(B-1) ≡3*(C-1) ≡(D-1) mod7.

So, we can set all these equal to some common value, say k mod7.

So, 6*(A-1) ≡k mod7,

2*(B-1) ≡k mod7,

3*(C-1) ≡k mod7,

(D-1) ≡k mod7.

So, each digit is related to k.

Let me solve for each digit in terms of k.

From the first equation:

6*(A-1) ≡k mod7 → A-1 ≡6^{-1} *k mod7.

What's 6 inverse mod7? Since 6*6=36≡1 mod7, so 6^{-1}=6 mod7.

So, A-1 ≡6k mod7 → A ≡6k +1 mod7.

Similarly, from the second equation:

2*(B-1)≡k mod7 → B-1≡(2^{-1})*k mod7.

2^{-1} mod7 is 4, because 2*4=8≡1 mod7.

So, B-1≡4k mod7 → B≡4k +1 mod7.

Third equation:

3*(C-1)≡k mod7 → C-1≡3^{-1}*k mod7.

3^{-1} mod7 is5, because 3*5=15≡1 mod7.

So, C-1≡5k mod7 → C≡5k +1 mod7.

Fourth equation:

D-1≡k mod7 → D≡k +1 mod7.

So, we have:

A ≡6k +1 mod7,

B ≡4k +1 mod7,

C ≡5k +1 mod7,

D ≡k +1 mod7.

Now, since A, B, C, D are digits (A from1-9, others 0-9), let's see what possible values of k mod7 would make A, B, C, D digits (i.e., within their ranges).

Let me consider k=0,1,2,3,4,5,6.

For each k, compute A, B, C, D mod7, then see what their possible values are to maximize N.

But since we want N to be as large as possible, we should try to maximize A, then B, then C, then D.

So, let's consider each possible k from0 to6 and see what gives the largest possible N.

Let me make a table:

For each k in 0-6:

Compute A mod7, B mod7, C mod7, D mod7.

Then, the maximum possible digit for each is:

A: can be up to9, so A ≡6k+1 mod7. To maximize A, set A=6k+1 +7*m, where m is as large as possible without exceeding9.

Similarly for B, C, D.

Let me compute for each k:

Case k=0:

A mod7=1 → A can be1,8,15... but since A is a digit, max A=8.

B mod7=1 → B can be1,8.

C mod7=1 → C can be1,8.

D mod7=1 → D can be1,8.

So, N would be 8881.

But let's check if this N=8881 satisfies the conditions.

Change A to1:1881. 1881 ÷7=268.714... 7*268=1876, 1881-1876=5. Not divisible.

So, N=8881 doesn't work.

But wait, maybe I can find a higher N with k=0.

Wait, but for k=0, A mod7=1, so maximum A=8.

Similarly, B=8, C=8, D=8.

So, N=8888.

Check if this works.

Change A to1:1888. 1888 ÷7=269.714... 7*269=1883, 1888-1883=5. Not divisible.

So, N=8888 doesn't work.

k=1:

A mod7=6*1+1=7→7 mod7=0 → A=7.

Wait, 6k+1=6*1+1=7→7 mod7=0. So, A≡0 mod7. Since A is a digit from1-9, possible A=7.

B mod7=4*1+1=5→ B=5.

C mod7=5*1+1=6→C=6.

D mod7=1+1=2→D=2.

So, N=7 5 6 2 →7562.

Wait, I think I saw this earlier. Changing A to1 gives1562, which isn't divisible by7.

So, N=7562 doesn't work.

But perhaps there's a higher N with k=1.

Wait, A=7+7=14, but A can't be more than9, so A=7 is the maximum.

Similarly, B=5, C=6, D=2.

So, N=7562. As before, doesn't work.

k=2:

A mod7=6*2+1=13 mod7=6 → A=6 or 6+7=13, but A can't be13. So A=6.

B mod7=4*2+1=9 mod7=2 → B=2 or9.

C mod7=5*2+1=11 mod7=4 → C=4 or11. But C can't be11, so C=4.

D mod7=2+1=3 → D=3 or10. But D can't be10, so D=3.

To maximize N, set B=9, C=4, D=3.

So, N= A B C D =6 9 4 3 →6943.

Check if this works.

Change A to1:1943. 1943 ÷7=277.571... 7*277=1939. 1943-1939=4. Not divisible.

So, N=6943 doesn't work.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in setting B=9. Let's check B=2.

N=6243.

Which we saw earlier doesn't work.

So, k=2 doesn't give a valid N.

k=3:

A mod7=6*3+1=19 mod7=5 → A=5 or12→ but A can't be12, so A=5.

B mod7=4*3+1=13 mod7=6 → B=6 or13→ B=6.

C mod7=5*3+1=16 mod7=2 → C=2 or9.

D mod7=3+1=4 → D=4 or11→ D=4.

To maximize N, set C=9, D=4.

So, N=5 6 9 4 →5694.

Check if this works.

Change A to1:1694. 1694 ÷7=242 exactly, since 7*242=1694. So, divisible.

Change B to1:5194. 5194 ÷7=742 exactly (7*742=5194). Divisible.

Change C to1:5614. 5614 ÷7=802 exactly. Divisible.

Change D to1:5691. 5691 ÷7=813 exactly. Yes, 7*813=5691.

So, N=5694 satisfies all four conditions.

Wait, this is better than the previous 5624 I found earlier. So, perhaps I made a mistake earlier.

Wait, but let me check if I correctly calculated N for k=3.

From earlier steps:

k=3:

A ≡6*3 +1=19 mod7=5 → A=5.

B≡4*3 +1=13 mod7=6 → B=6.

C≡5*3 +1=16 mod7=2 → C=2 or9.

To maximize, set C=9.

D≡3+1=4 → D=4.

So, N=5 6 9 4 →5694.

Which works.

So, this is a better candidate.

Wait, but earlier when I tried x=4, I got N=5624, which worked, but this N=5694 is higher and also works. So, perhaps my initial approach with x was flawed.

So, let's see if I can find a higher N with k=4.

k=4:

A mod7=6*4 +1=25 mod7=4 → A=4 or11→ A=4.

B mod7=4*4 +1=17 mod7=3 → B=3 or10→ B=3.

C mod7=5*4 +1=21 mod7=0 → C=0 or7.

D mod7=4+1=5 → D=5 or12→ D=5.

To maximize N, set C=7, D=5.

So, N=4 3 7 5 →4375.

Check if this works.

Change A to1:1375. 1375 ÷7=196.428... Not integer. So, N=4375 doesn't work.

Alternatively, maybe setting C=0, D=5: N=4305.

Check: Change A to1:1305. 1305 ÷7=186.428... Not integer. So, no.

So, k=4 doesn't give a valid N.

k=5:

A mod7=6*5 +1=31 mod7=3 → A=3 or10→ A=3.

B mod7=4*5 +1=21 mod7=0 → B=0 or7.

C mod7=5*5 +1=26 mod7=5 → C=5 or12→ C=5.

D mod7=5+1=6 → D=6 or13→ D=6.

To maximize N, set B=7, C=5, D=6.

So, N=3 7 5 6 →3756.

Check if this works.

Change A to1:1756. 1756 ÷7=250.857... Not integer. So, N=3756 doesn't work.

k=6:

A mod7=6*6 +1=37 mod7=2 → A=2 or9.

B mod7=4*6 +1=25 mod7=4 → B=4 or11→ B=4.

C mod7=5*6 +1=31 mod7=3 → C=3 or10→ C=3.

D mod7=6+1=7 mod7=0 → D=0 or7.

To maximize N, set A=9, B=4, C=3, D=7.

So, N=9 4 3 7 →9437.

Wait, but earlier when I tried x=8, which corresponds to k=3*8=24 mod7=3, which is k=3, but in this approach, for k=6, I get N=9437.

Wait, but earlier when I tried N=9437, changing A to1 gave1437, which wasn't divisible by7.

So, let's check again.

N=9437.

Change A to1:1437 ÷7=205.285... Not integer. So, not divisible.

Thus, N=9437 doesn't work.

But according to the congruences, it should. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, for k=6:

A ≡6*6 +1=37 mod7=2 → A=2 or9.

So, A=9 is allowed.

B≡4*6 +1=25 mod7=4 → B=4.

C≡5*6 +1=31 mod7=3 → C=3.

D≡6+1=7 mod7=0 → D=0 or7. So, D=7.

Thus, N=9437.

But when I change A to1, I get1437, which is not divisible by7.

So, perhaps there's an error in this approach.

Wait, according to the earlier congruences, N must satisfy N≡k mod7 for each condition, where k=6.

So, N=9437. Let's compute N mod7.

Compute 9437 ÷7.

7*1348=9436. So, 9437=7*1348 +1 →9437≡1 mod7.

But for k=6, N≡k=6 mod7. But 9437≡1 mod7, which contradicts.

So, something's wrong here.

Wait, perhaps I messed up the congruences.

Wait, from earlier:

N ≡6*(A-1) mod7.

But if N=9437, then N mod7=1.

So, 6*(A-1) ≡1 mod7.

But A=9 →A-1=8 →6*8=48≡6 mod7. 48 mod7=6. So, 6≡1 mod7? No, 6≠1 mod7. So, this is a contradiction.

Thus, N=9437 doesn't satisfy the congruence for k=6. So, what's wrong here?

Ah, I think I see the mistake. Earlier, when I set N≡k mod7, I think I misapplied the congruences. Let me re-examine.

We have:

N ≡6*(A-1) mod7 =k,

N ≡2*(B-1) mod7 =k,

N ≡3*(C-1) mod7 =k,

N ≡(D-1) mod7 =k.

So, all four are equal to k mod7.

But when I tried k=6, I set:

A ≡6k +1 mod7 →6*6 +1=37 mod7=2 →A=9.

But then N=9437, which mod7=1, but k=6.

Thus, 6*(A-1)=6*(8)=48≡6 mod7. So, k=6.

But N=9437≡1 mod7, which doesn't equal k=6.

So, this is a contradiction. Therefore, N=9437 doesn't satisfy the condition, which we saw earlier.

Thus, k=6 is invalid.

So, only when the congruence N≡k mod7 holds, and N is built from digits that satisfy the relations to k, then N will satisfy the conditions.

So, from the earlier cases, only for k=3, N=5694 worked.

But let me check for other k's.

Wait, earlier for k=3, N=5694 worked.

Is there a higher N for k=3?

Wait, when k=3, A=5, B=6, C=9, D=4. So, N=5694.

But perhaps if I can set A=5, B=6, C=9, D=4, but also have higher digits elsewhere.

Wait, no, because A is fixed at5 for k=3.

Wait, perhaps I can find a higher N for k=3 by increasing other digits.

Wait, for k=3, C can be 2 or9, so setting C=9 gives a higher N.

Similarly, D=4 or11, but D=4 is the only valid digit. So, N=5694 is the maximum for k=3.

Now, let's check if there's a higher N for another k.

k=3: N=5694.

k=2: N=6943 didn't work.

k=1: N=7562 didn't work.

k=0: N=8888 didn't work.

k=4: N=4375 didn't work.

k=5: N=3756 didn't work.

k=6: N=9437 didn't work.

Thus, the highest valid N is 5694.

Wait, but earlier I thought N=5624 worked, but now I'm seeing N=5694 works and is higher.

Let me check N=5694 again.

Changing A to1:1694. 1694 ÷7=242. Exactly divisible.

Changing B to1:5194. 5194 ÷7=742. Exactly divisible.

Changing C to1:5614. 5614 ÷7=802. Exactly divisible.

Changing D to1:5691. 5691 ÷7=813. Exactly divisible.

Yes, all four modified numbers are divisible by7. So, N=5694 works.

But wait, earlier when I tried x=4, I got N=5624, which also worked. So, perhaps there's a higher N than 5624.

But according to this analysis, N=5694 is higher and works. So, perhaps my earlier approach with x was missing some possibilities.

So, N=5694 is higher than 5624 and works.

Wait, but let's see if there's a higher N than 5694. Let's check k=3 and see if I can get a higher N.

Wait, for k=3:

A=5, B=6, C=9, D=4.

If I can set A higher, but for k=3, A=5 is fixed.

Wait, no, because for k=3, A≡6*3 +1=19≡5 mod7. So, A can be5 or12, but 12 is invalid. So, A=5 is the maximum.

Thus, N=5694 is the maximum for k=3.

Is there any higher N for another k?

Wait, perhaps I missed some k.

Wait, perhaps I should check for other k's where N can be higher.

Wait, for k=3, N=5694.

Let me check if there's a higher N for k=3.

Wait, but A=5 is fixed, so the maximum N for k=3 is 5694.

Now, let's check if for k=3, there's a higher N.

Wait, perhaps if C=9, D=4, but also B=6, and A=5.

Yes, that's the maximum.

So, N=5694 is the highest valid four-digit number meeting the conditions.

Wait, but earlier I thought N=5624 worked, but now I see N=5694 works and is higher.

So, perhaps I should take N=5694 as the answer.

But wait, let's check if for k=3, there's a higher N.

Wait, what's the next possible A for k=3? A=5+7=12, which is invalid. So, A=5 is the maximum.

Thus, N=5694 is the highest.

But let me cross-verify.

Compute N=5694.

Check:

Change A to1:1694 ÷7=242. Exactly.

Change B to1:5194 ÷7=742. Exactly.

Change C to1:5614 ÷7=802. Exactly.

Change D to1:5691 ÷7=813. Exactly.

All four conditions are met.

So, N=5694 is valid.

Now, let's check if there's a higher N. Let's see, the next higher number after 5694 is 5695, but let's see if it meets the conditions.

But perhaps it's easier to proceed with N=5694.

Now, the problem asks for Q and R when N is divided by1000.

N=5694.

Divide by1000: 5694 ÷1000=5 with remainder 694.

So, Q=5, R=694.

Thus, Q + R=5 + 694=699.

Wait, but earlier I thought N=5624, which would give Q=5, R=624, sum=629.

But since N=5694 is higher and valid, the correct answer should be 5 + 694=699.

Wait, but let me make sure I didn't miss any higher N.

Wait, for k=3, N=5694.

Is there a higher N for another k?

Wait, for k=3, N=5694.

What about k=3, but with higher digits elsewhere?

Wait, for k=3, A=5, B=6, C=9, D=4.

Is there a way to make B=6, but higher than that? No, because for k=3, B=6 is the maximum.

Similarly, C=9 is the maximum for C.

So, N=5694 is the maximum for k=3.

Thus, the answer should be Q + R=5 +694=699.

But wait, earlier when I thought N=5624 was the answer, I got Q+R=5+624=629.

But since N=5694 is higher and valid, 699 is the correct answer.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused because earlier I found N=5624, but upon further analysis, N=5694 works and is higher.

Let me double-check if N=5694 works.

Yes, all four modified numbers are divisible by7, as I computed earlier.

Thus, Q=5, R=694, sum=699.

Wait, but let me check for k=3, if there's another N higher than5694.

Wait, perhaps if I set A=5, B=6, C=9, D=4, but also adjust other digits? No, because for k=3, D is determined as4.

Wait, perhaps there's a higher N for another k.

Wait, another approach: Since N=5694 works, and it's the highest found so far, perhaps it's the correct answer.

Thus, the final answer is Q + R =5 +694=699.


To solve the problem, we need to find the greatest four-digit number \( N \) such that changing any one of its digits to 1 results in a number divisible by 7. Then, we compute \( Q + R \) where \( Q \) is the quotient and \( R \) is the remainder when \( N \) is divided by 1000.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Understanding the Problem**:
   - \( N \) is a four-digit number, i.e., \( 1000 \leq N \leq 9999 \).
   - Changing any single digit of \( N \) to 1 results in a number divisible by 7.

2. **Setting Up Congruences**:
   - Let \( N = 1000A + 100B + 10C + D \) where \( A, B, C, D \) are digits.
   - For each digit, changing it to 1 results in a number divisible by 7:
     - Changing \( A \) to 1: \( 1BCD \) must be divisible by 7.
     - Changing \( B \) to 1: \( A1CD \) must be divisible by 7.
     - Changing \( C \) to 1: \( AB1D \) must be divisible by 7.
     - Changing \( D \) to 1: \( ABC1 \) must be divisible by 7.

3. **Expressing in Terms of \( N \)**:
   - Each modified number can be expressed as \( N \) minus the original digit times its place value plus 1 times the place value.
   - This leads to four congruence conditions modulo 7.

4. **Simplifying Congruences**:
   - Using modular arithmetic, we derive that:
     - \( N \equiv 6(A-1) \mod 7 \)
     - \( N \equiv 2(B-1) \mod 7 \)
     - \( N \equiv 3(C-1) \mod 7 \)
     - \( N \equiv (D-1) \mod 7 \)
   - All four expressions must be congruent modulo 7.

5. **Finding Relationships Between Digits**:
   - By setting all congruences equal to a common value \( k \mod 7 \), we express each digit in terms of \( k \):
     - \( A \equiv 6k + 1 \mod 7 \)
     - \( B \equiv 4k + 1 \mod 7 \)
     - \( C \equiv 5k + 1 \mod 7 \)
     - \( D \equiv k + 1 \mod 7 \)

6. **Maximizing \( N \)**:
   - For each \( k \) from 0 to 6, compute the maximum possible digits \( A, B, C, D \) that satisfy the congruences and form the largest \( N \).
   - After evaluating all possibilities, the highest valid \( N \) found is 5694.

7. **Verification**:
   - Changing each digit of 5694 to 1 results in numbers divisible by 7:
     - \( 1694 \div 7 = 242 \) (exact division)
     - \( 5194 \div 7 = 742 \) (exact division)
     - \( 5614 \div 7 = 802 \) (exact division)
     - \( 5691 \div 7 = 813 \) (exact division)

8. **Calculating \( Q + R \)**:
   - Divide \( N = 5694 \) by 1000:
     - \( Q = 5 \)
     - \( R = 694 \)
   - Sum: \( Q + R = 5 + 694 = 699 \)

### Final Answer:
\boxed{699}
