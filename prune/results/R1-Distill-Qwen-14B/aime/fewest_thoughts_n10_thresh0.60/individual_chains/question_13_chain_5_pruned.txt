Okay, so I have this math problem here about Aya's morning walk and coffee shop stops. Hmm, let's try to break it down step by step. 

First, the problem says that every morning Aya goes for a 9-kilometer-long walk and stops at a coffee shop. When she walks at a constant speed of 's' kilometers per hour, her entire walk including the coffee shop takes 4 hours. But when she walks at 's + 2' kilometers per hour, it takes her 2 hours and 24 minutes. They want to find out how long her walk takes when she walks at 's + 1/2' kilometers per hour, including the same 't' minutes spent in the coffee shop.

Wait, so it's all about her walking time and the time she spends in the coffee shop. The total time includes both the walking duration and the coffee stop. So, the total time is walking time plus 't' minutes.

Let me see. Let's denote:

- Distance walked: 9 km
- Speeds: s km/h and (s + 2) km/h
- Total time at speed s: 4 hours (which is 240 minutes)
- Total time at speed s + 2: 2 hours 24 minutes (which is 144 minutes)
- The coffee shop time is 't' minutes, which is constant in both cases.

So, when she walks at speed 's', the time she spends walking is (9 / s) hours, and the total time including coffee is 4 hours. Similarly, at speed
