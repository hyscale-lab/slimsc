Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the radius squared of the smallest sphere that can contain any rectangular box from the set B. The set B consists of boxes with a surface area of 54 and a volume of 23. The answer should be expressed as a fraction p/q where p and q are coprime, and then I need to find p+q.

Hmm, let me start by understanding the problem. So, each box in B has surface area 54 and volume 23. I need to find the minimal sphere that can contain any such box. The sphere's radius squared will be the square of half the space diagonal of the box because the sphere must enclose the box entirely. The space diagonal is the longest distance inside the box, stretching from one corner to the opposite corner. So, the sphere's diameter must be at least as long as this diagonal, making the radius half of that diagonal.

So, the radius squared would be (1/2 * space diagonal)^2. That would be (space diagonal squared) divided by 4.

First, I need to express the space diagonal in terms of the box's dimensions. Let me denote the dimensions of the box as x, y, z. Then, the space diagonal is sqrt(x² + y² + z²). So, the radius squared would be (x² + y² + z²)/4.

Therefore, to minimize r², I need to minimize (x² + y² + z²) given the constraints of surface area and volume.

The surface area S of a rectangular box is 2(xy + yz + xz) = 54. And the volume V is xyz = 23.

So, I have two constraints: 2(xy + yz + xz) = 54 and xyz = 23.

I need to minimize x² + y² + z² under these constraints.

This sounds like a problem that can be tackled using the method of Lagrange multipliers, but maybe there's a simpler way using inequalities.

I remember that for positive real numbers, certain inequalities relate sums and products. For example, the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality or the AM ≥ GM inequality.

Wait, but in this case, we have two constraints, so maybe forming a function with two constraints is better. Alternatively, express variables in terms of others.

Alternatively, perhaps I can assume symmetry or set variables to be equal to simplify, but I don't know if the minimal diagonal occurs when all dimensions are equal. Maybe not, since the volume and surface area might not be compatible with a cube.

Wait, let me see if the box can be a cube. If x = y = z, then surface area would be 6x² = 54, so x² = 9, so x=3. Then volume would be 27, but we need volume 23, so it's not a cube. Therefore, the box isn't a cube, so the minimal diagonal isn't achieved at a cube.

So, another approach: Let me denote variables. Let’s let x, y, z be positive real numbers. So, with constraints:

1. 2(xy + yz + xz) = 54 → xy + yz + xz = 27
2. xyz = 23

We need to find the minimum of x² + y² + z².

Hmm, how can I relate x² + y² + z² with the given constraints?

I remember that (x + y + z)^2 = x² + y² + z² + 2(xy + yz + xz). Since I know xy + yz + xz = 27, then (x + y + z)^2 = x² + y² + z² + 54. Therefore, x² + y² + z² = (x + y + z)^2 - 54.

So, to minimize x² + y² + z², I need to minimize (x + y + z)^2. Thus, minimizing x + y + z would help.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use Lagrange multipliers since we have two constraints.

Let’s set up the Lagrangian. Let me denote f(x, y, z) = x² + y² + z², which I need to minimize.

The constraints are g(x, y, z) = xy + yz + xz - 27 = 0 and h(x, y, z) = xyz - 23 = 0.

So, the Lagrangian would be:

L = x² + y² + z² - λ(xy + yz + xz -
