Okay, so I'm trying to solve this geometry problem about a convex equilateral hexagon. Let me try to understand the problem first.

The hexagon is named ABCDEF, and it's convex and equilateral. That means all its sides are equal in length, but they don't necessarily have to be equal in angles, right? Also, all pairs of opposite sides are parallel. So, AB is parallel to DE, BC is parallel to EF, and CD is parallel to FA.

The problem also mentions a triangle formed by extending the sides AB, CD, and EF. The lengths of the sides of this triangle are 200, 240, and 300. I need to find the side length of the hexagon.

Hmm, so first, let me visualize this hexagon. Since it's convex and equilateral with opposite sides parallel, it's probably similar to a regular hexagon but maybe stretched or compressed along certain axes. But not necessarily regular because the triangle formed by extending AB, CD, EF has sides of different lengths.

Wait, a regular hexagon would have all sides equal and all opposite sides parallel, right? But in this case, the hexagon is just equilateral, not necessarily regular. So, the sides are equal, but the angles can be different as long as opposite sides remain parallel.

Now, the triangle formed by extending AB, CD, and EF. Let me think about how that triangle is formed. If I extend AB beyond B and beyond A, CD beyond C and D, and EF beyond E and F, these extensions should meet at some points forming a triangle. The sides of this triangle have lengths 200, 240, and 300.

I think I can model this using similar triangles or perhaps coordinate geometry. Maybe setting up coordinates to represent the hexagon and then figuring out the side length.

Let me try to assign coordinates to the hexagon. Let me place point A at the origin (0,0). Since the hexagon is convex and equilateral, each side will have the same length, say 's', which is what I need to find.

But since opposite sides are parallel, I can model each pair as vectors. Let me think in terms of vectors. Let me denote the sides as vectors:

AB, BC, CD, DE, EF, FA.

Since the hexagon is closed, the sum of these vectors is zero.

Moreover, since opposite sides are parallel and equal in length (since it's equilateral), we have AB = DE, BC = EF, CD = FA, but in the opposite direction.

Wait, no. Wait, the hexagon is equilateral, so the sides are equal in length, but opposite sides are parallel. So, AB is parallel to DE, BC parallel to EF, CD parallel to FA.

But the direction matters. So, AB and DE are in the same direction? Or opposite?

Wait, in a convex hexagon
