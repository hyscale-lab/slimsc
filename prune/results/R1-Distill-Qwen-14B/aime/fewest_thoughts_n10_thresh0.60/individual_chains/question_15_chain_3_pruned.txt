Okay, so I've got this problem here about counting the number of paths on an 8x8 grid. The paths go from the lower left corner to the upper right corner, have a length of 16, and change direction exactly four times. Hmm, okay, let me try to unpack this.

First, I know that in an 8x8 grid, moving from the lower left to the upper right, you have to make 8 moves to the right and 8 moves up, right? So, any path from start to finish is a combination of these moves. The total number of such paths without any restrictions is the binomial coefficient C(16,8), which is 12870. But that's without any constraints on the number of direction changes.

Now, the problem says the path changes direction exactly four times. Hmm, I need to figure out what that means. Every time you change direction, you switch from moving right to up or from up to right. So, each direction change corresponds to switching between these two moves.

Wait, so a path that changes direction four times would have four points where it switches from right to up or up to right. So, how does this break down the path into segments?

Let me think. If a path changes direction four times, that means it consists of five segments. Because each direction change marks the end of one segment and the start of another. So, if you have four changes, you have five straight segments.

Each segment is either a horizontal (right) move or a vertical (up) move. Now, these segments have to alternate between right and up. So, the path starts with either a right or an up move, then alternates each time it changes direction.

So, the first segment could be right or up, and then it alternates. So, the number of segments of each direction depends on whether the first move is right or up.

Let's consider two cases: paths that start with a right move and paths that start with an up move.

Case 1: Starts with right.

In this case, the segments go right, up, right, up, right. Wait, no, because there are four direction changes, so five segments. So, starting with right, the segments would be right, up, right, up, right. So, three right segments and two up segments. Wait, no, because four direction changes mean five segments. So, if starting with right, the number
