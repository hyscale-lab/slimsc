Okay, so I'm trying to solve this grid path problem. It says that we have an 8x8 grid, and we're supposed to find the number of paths of length 16 that change direction exactly four times. The paths go from the lower left corner to the upper right corner. 

First, I need to visualize the grid. An 8x8 grid has 9 points along each side, right? Because an 8x8 grid means there are 8 squares along each dimension, so the number of points is 9 in each direction. So, moving from the lower left to the upper right corner on an 8x8 grid would require 8 steps to the right and 8 steps up, in some order. That makes sense because the path has to go from (0,0) to (8,8), moving only right or up.

So, the total number of steps is 16, which is 8 rights and 8 ups. But the problem isn't just about the total number of paths; it's about the number of paths that change direction exactly four times. That part is trickier. 

Wait, let me clarify: when they say "change direction," does that mean every time the path switches from moving right to up or up to right? So, for example, if I go right, right, right, then up, up, up, that's one change of direction. Each time the direction switches, that's a change. So, the number of direction changes is one less than the number of runs in the path. A run is a consecutive sequence of the same direction. For example, a path that goes R, R, U, U, R, U would have three runs: two R's, then two U's, then one R, then one U. So, that's four runs, which would mean three direction changes. Wait, hold on, no. Wait, if you have four runs, how many direction changes? Let's see: starting with R, then switching to U is one change, then switching back to R is another, then switching to U again is the third. So, four runs mean three direction changes. So, the number of direction changes is one less than the number of runs. So, if the path has k runs, it has k-1 direction changes.

Therefore, the problem is asking for the number of paths with exactly four direction changes. So, in terms of runs, that would be 5 runs. Because 4 direction changes = 5 runs. Let me verify: for example, starting with right, then up, then right, then up, then rightâ€”this would be 5 runs and 4 direction changes. Yep, that makes sense.

So, our problem reduces to counting the number of lattice paths from (0,0) to (8,8) with exactly 5 runs. Each run is a consecutive sequence of right or up steps. So, we need to model this.

How do we model such a path? Well, each run alternates between right and up. So, the path can start with a right run or an up run. Then alternates. So, for 5 runs, it alternates 4 times. So, the number of runs would be either starting with R or U, then alternating.

So, for 5 runs, it could be R, U, R, U, R or U, R, U, R, U. So, two possible cases depending on whether the first run is R or U.

Now, each run is a consecutive sequence of right or up steps. So, let's say the path starts with a run of R steps, then a run of U steps, and so on, for a total of 5 runs. Similarly, if it starts with U, it alternates.

So, let's model each case separately.

Case 1: The path starts with a right run, then up, then right, then up, then right.

Case 2: The path starts with an up run, then right, then up, then right, then up.

So, each case has 5 runs, and in each case, we have 3 runs in one direction and 2 runs in the other. Because 5 runs, starting with R: R, U, R, U, R. That's three R runs and two U runs. Similarly, starting with U: U, R, U, R, U. That's three U runs and two R runs.

Wait, no, actually, wait: 5 runs, starting with R, then alternates. So, 3 R runs and 2 U runs. Similarly, starting with U, 3 U runs and 2 R runs.

So, in both cases, we have 3 runs in one direction and 2 in the other.

In either case, the total number of R steps is 8 and the total number of U steps is 8. So, in each case, we need to distribute the 8 R steps into 3 runs, and the 8 U steps into 2 runs, or vice versa.

Wait, in Case 1: starting with R, we have 3 R runs and 2 U runs. So, the number of ways to distribute the R steps is the number of ways to partition 8 R's into 3 runs, where each run is at least 1. Similarly for U steps.

Similarly for Case 2: 3 U runs and 2 R runs.

So, for each case, the number of ways is the product of the number of compositions of 8 into 3 parts (for R) and the number of compositions of 8 into 2 parts (for U). Then, since each case (starting with R or U) is separate, we'll have to calculate both and add them together.

Wait, but hold on: in the problem, is the starting point fixed? The path goes from lower left to upper right, which is (0,0) to (8,8). So, the path can start with either a right or an up step. So, both cases are possible.

Therefore, the total number of such paths would be the sum of the number of paths starting with R and having 5 runs, and the number starting with U and having 5 runs.

So, let's model each case.

Case 1: Starting with R.

Number of R runs: 3.

Each R run must have at least 1 step.

So, the number of ways to distribute 8 R's into 3 runs is the number of compositions of 8 into 3 parts, which is C(8-1, 3-1) = C(7,2) = 21.

Similarly, the number of U runs is 2, each with at least 1 step. So, number of compositions is C(8-1, 2-1) = C(7,1) =7.

So, the number of paths in Case 1 is 21 *7 = 147.

Similarly, Case 2: starting with U.

Number of U runs:3.

Number of compositions: C(8-1,3-1)= C(7,2)=21.

Number of R runs:2.

Number of compositions: C(8-1,2-1)=7.

So, number of paths in Case 2 is 21*7=147.

Therefore, total number of paths is 147 +147= 294.

Wait, but hold on. Let me make sure I didn't make a mistake here.

Wait, no, that can't be right because in the problem statement, the grid is 8x8, so 9x9 points. The number of total paths is C(16,8)=12870. So, 294 is a small number compared to that, which is plausible.

But let me think again. Each case is starting with R or U, and in each case, the number of ways is 21*7=147. So, total 294.

But wait, another way to think about it: the number of paths with exactly 5 runs is equal to 2*(C(7,2)*C(7,1))= 2*21*7= 294.

Yes, that's the same as before.

But wait, let me think about runs and direction changes again.

Because in a path, the number of direction changes is one less than the number of runs. So, we require exactly four direction changes, which implies exactly five runs. So, the calculation seems correct.

Another way: each path with exactly five runs must have four direction changes.

So, the formula is 2 * (C(7, k-1) * C(7, l-1)) where k is the number of runs in one direction and l in the other. Since in each case, starting with R or U, the number of runs in each direction is 3 and 2.

Wait, but perhaps I should think in terms of stars and bars.

The number of compositions of n into m parts is C(n-1, m-1). So, for each direction, it's correct.

So, for starting with R, we have 3 R runs and 2 U runs. So, the number of ways is C(7,2)*C(7,1)=21*7=147.

Similarly, starting with U, 3 U runs and 2 R runs, same result.

Thus, total 294.

Wait, but I just thought: perhaps the number of runs is only when the direction alternates. So, if you have 5 runs, but the starting direction can vary.

Wait, but the way we've considered, starting with R or U, and having 3 runs in the starting direction and 2 in the other. So, that should account for all possibilities.

Hmm, but wait, suppose I have a path that starts with R, then U, then R, then U, then R. That's 5 runs, 4 direction changes.

Similarly, starting with U, then R, U, R, U. Also 5 runs, 4 direction changes.

So, in each case, the number of such paths is C(7,2)*C(7,1) for each starting direction. So, 21*7=147 per case, so total 294.

So, that seems correct.

Wait, but maybe I should test this on a smaller grid to see if the logic holds.

Let's take a 1x1 grid, so 2x2 points. The total paths from (0,0) to (1,1) are 2: right then up, or up then right.

Each path has exactly one direction change. So, in this case, for a grid of size 1x1, the number of paths with exactly one direction change is 2.

Using our formula: For a grid of size 1x1, the number of runs would be 2. So, direction changes =1.

So, according to our formula, we would have 2*(C(0,1-1)*C(0,1-1))=2*(C(0,0)*C(0,0))=2*1*1=2, which is correct.

AnotherOkay, so I have this problem about counting paths on an 8x8 grid. The paths are from the lower left corner to the upper right corner, and they have a length of 16. I need to find the number of such paths that change direction exactly four times. Hmm, okay.

First, let me make sure I understand the problem correctly. An 8x8 grid would have 8 rows and 8 columns, right? So, moving from the lower left to the upper right, you have to move 8 steps to the right and 8 steps up. That makes a total of 16 steps, which is consistent with the path length given.

Now, the path can only move along the lines, so each step is either to the right or up. But the catch here is that the path changes direction exactly four times. So, how does that affect the count?

Let me think. Normally, without any restrictions, the number of paths from the lower left to the upper right is the number of ways to arrange 8 right steps and 8 up steps. That's the combination C(16,8), which is 12870. But here, we have the constraint of exactly four direction changes.

So, what does it mean to change direction exactly four times? Well, each time the path switches from moving right to up or from up to right, that's a direction change. So, if the path starts with a right move, then each up move after that would be a direction change until it switches back to right again.

Wait, actually, the path can start with either a right or an up move, depending on the
