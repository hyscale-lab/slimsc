Okay, so I have this problem here: There exist real numbers x and y, both greater than 1, such that log base x of y^x equals log base y of x^(4y), and both of these are equal to 10. I need to find the product xy. Hmm, let me try to figure this out.

First, let's write down what is given. The expressions are logarithmic, so maybe I can convert them into exponential form to make it easier. I remember that log_b(a) = c is equivalent to b^c = a. So, let's apply that.

The first equation is log_x(y^x) = 10. Converting that to exponential form, it should be x^10 = y^x. Wait, no, hold on. Wait, actually, log_x(y^x) = 10. Let's make sure I do this correctly. The base is x, the argument is y^x, and the result is 10. So, x^10 = y^x. Yes, that's right.

Similarly, the second equation is log_y(x^{4y}) = 10. So, converting that, it should be y^10 = x^{4y}. Got it.

So now I have two equations:

1. x^10 = y^x
2. y^10 = x^{4y}

Hmm, okay. Now, I need to find x and y, both greater than 1, and then find their product xy. So, perhaps I can solve these equations simultaneously.

Let me write them again:

1. x^10 = y^x  --> Equation (1)
2. y^10 = x^{4y} --> Equation (2)

Hmm, these are both exponential equations. Maybe I can take logarithms on both sides to make them more manageable.

Let's take the natural logarithm, for example. Taking ln of both sides of Equation (1):

ln(x^10) = ln(y^x)

Which simplifies to 10 ln x = x ln y. Because ln(a^b) = b ln a.

Similarly, for Equation (2):

ln(y^10) = ln(x^{4y})

Which becomes 10 ln y = 4y ln x.

So now I have two new equations:

3. 10 ln x = x ln y --> Equation (3)
4. 10 ln y = 4y ln x --> Equation (4)

Hmm, okay. So now I have two equations with ln x and ln y. Maybe I can express one variable in terms of the other.

Let me see. From Equation (3), 10 ln x = x ln y. Let me solve for ln y.

ln y = (10 ln x) / x.

Similarly, from Equation (4): 10 ln y = 4y ln x. Let's substitute ln y from Equation (3) into Equation (4).

So, substituting ln y = (10 ln x)/x into Equation (4):

10 * (10 ln x / x) = 4y ln x

Simplify the left side: 100 ln x / x = 4y ln x.

Hmm, okay. Now, let's see. Let me write that again:

100 ln x / x = 4y ln x.

Assuming ln x is not zero, which it can't be because x > 1, so ln x > 0. So, we can divide both sides by ln x without any issues.

So, 100 / x = 4y.

Simplify this: 100 / x = 4y.

Divide both sides by 4: 25 / x = y.

So, y = 25 / x. --> Equation (5)

Alright, so now I have y expressed in terms of x. Let me plug this back into Equation (3) or (4) to find a relation solely in terms of x.

Let me take Equation (3): 10 ln x = x ln y.

But since y = 25 / x, let's compute ln y.

ln y = ln(25/x) = ln 25 - ln x.

So, substituting into Equation (3):

10 ln x = x (ln 25 - ln x).

Let me write that out:

10 ln x = x ln 25 - x ln x.

Hmm, let me rearrange this equation:

10 ln x + x ln x = x ln 25.

Factor out ln x on the left:

ln x (10 + x) = x ln 25.

Hmm, okay. So, ln x = [x ln 25] / (10 + x). --> Equation (6)

Now, maybe I can express x in terms of another variable or find an equation that can be solved for x.

Alternatively, perhaps I can take Equation (6) and use it in another equation. Let's see.

Wait, Equation (5) is y = 25 / x, so y is related to x. Maybe I can find another equation to plug into.

Wait, let's go back to Equation (1): x^10 = y^x.

Since y =
