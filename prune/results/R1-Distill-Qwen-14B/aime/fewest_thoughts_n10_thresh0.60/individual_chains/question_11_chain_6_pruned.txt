Okay, so I've got this math problem here, and I need to find the largest possible real part of this expression: (75 + 117i)z + (96 + 144i)/z, where z is a complex number with |z| = 4. Hmm, that seems a bit complicated, but I'll try to break it down.

First, I remember that any complex number z can be written in the form z = a + bi, where a and b are real numbers, and i is the imaginary unit. But since |z| = 4, that means the magnitude of z is 4. The magnitude is calculated as sqrt(a² + b²) = 4, so a² + b² = 16. That's a constraint I have to remember.

Now, the expression given is (75 + 117i)z + (96 + 144i)/z. I'm supposed to find the largest possible real part of this. Let me denote this expression as E. So,

E = (75 + 117i)z + (96 + 144i)/z

I think it might help to express z in polar form because dealing with division in polar form is easier. Since |z| = 4, z can be written as 4e^{iθ}, where θ is the argument (angle) of z. That way, 1/z would be (1/4)e^{-iθ}.

So let's rewrite E using this polar form:

E = (75 + 117i)*4e^{iθ} + (96 + 144i)*(1/4)e^{-iθ}

Simplify the constants:

First term: (75 + 117i)*4 = 4*75 + 4*117i = 300 + 468i.

Second term: (96 + 144i)/4 = 24 + 36i.

So now E becomes:

E = (300 + 468i)e^{iθ} + (24 + 36i)e^{-iθ}

Hmm, that's better. Now, I can write each term using Euler's formula, which states that e^{iθ} = cosθ + i sinθ. So, expand each part.

Let me denote the first term as A = (300 + 468i)(cosθ + i sinθ) and the second term as B = (24 + 36i)(cosθ - i sinθ).

So, E = A + B.

I'll compute A and B separately.

Compute A:

A = (300 + 468i)(cosθ + i sinθ)
Multiply this out:
A = 300 cosθ + 300i sinθ + 468i cosθ + 468i² sinθ
Since i² = -1, this becomes:
A = 300 cosθ + (300 sinθ + 468 cosθ)i - 468 sinθ

So, A = (300 cosθ - 468 sinθ) + (300 sinθ + 468 cosθ)i

Similarly, compute B:

B = (24 + 36i)(cosθ - i sinθ)
Multiply this out:
B = 24 cosθ - 24i sinθ + 36i cosθ - 36i² sinθ
Again, i² = -1, so:
B = 24 cosθ - 24i sinθ + 36i cosθ + 36 sinθ

Grouping real and imaginary parts:
B = (24 cosθ + 36 sinθ) + (-24 sinθ + 36 cosθ)i

Now, combine A and B to get E:

E = A + B = [ (300 cosθ - 468 sinθ) + (300 sinθ + 468 cosθ)i ] + [ (24 cosθ + 36 sinθ) + (-24 sinθ + 36 cosθ)i ]

Let's add the real parts and the imaginary parts separately.

Real part:
300 cosθ - 468 sinθ + 24 cosθ + 36 sinθ
= (300 + 24) cosθ + (-468 + 36) sinθ
= 324 cosθ - 432 sinθ

Imaginary part:
(300 sinθ + 468 cosθ) + (-24 sinθ + 36 cosθ)
= (300 -24) sinθ + (468 + 36) cosθ
= 276 sinθ + 504 cosθ

So, E can be written as:

E = (324 cosθ - 432 sinθ) + (276 sinθ + 504 cosθ)i

But we're only interested in the real part of E, so let's focus on Re(E):

Re(E) = 324 cosθ - 432 sinθ

Our goal is to find the maximum value of Re(E). So, we can think of Re(E) as a function of θ, and we need to find its maximum.

Let me denote f(θ) = 324 cosθ - 432 sinθ.

To find the maximum of f(θ), I can use the method of expressing such functions in the form R cos(θ + φ), where R is the amplitude and φ is the phase shift. Alternatively, I can take the derivative and set it to zero, but since this is a sinusoidal function, the maximum will be R.

Wait, let me think. For a function like A cosθ + B sinθ, the maximum value is sqrt(A² + B²). Because it can be written as R cos(θ - φ), where R = sqrt(A² + B²).

In our case, f(θ) = 324 cosθ - 432 sinθ.

So, A = 324, B = -432.

Thus, the maximum value is sqrt(324² + (-432)^2).

Compute this:

324 squared: 324 * 324. Let me compute step by step.

324 * 300 = 97,200

324 * 24 = 7,776

So, 97,200 + 7,776 = 104,976.

Similarly, 432 squared: 432 * 432.

Well, 400² = 160,000. 32² = 1,024. Then, cross terms: 2*400*32=25,600.

So, 160,000 + 25,600 + 1,024 = 186,624.

But since it's (-432)^2, it's still 186,624.

So, R = sqrt(104,976 + 186,
