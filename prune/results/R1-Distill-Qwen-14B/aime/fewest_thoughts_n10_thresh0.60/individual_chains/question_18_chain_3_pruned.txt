Okay, so I've got this problem: find the number of rectangles that can be formed inside a regular dodecagon, where each side of the rectangle lies on either a side or a diagonal of the dodecagon. Hmm, not too bad, but I need to think carefully.

First, let me visualize a regular dodecagon. It's a 12-sided polygon with all sides equal and all internal angles equal. Each internal angle is 150 degrees, right? Because the formula for internal angles is ((n-2)*180)/n, which for n=12 gives ((10)*180)/12 = 150 degrees each.

Now, the problem says that each side of the rectangle lies on either a side or a diagonal of the dodecagon. So, I'm picturing a rectangle where each side is aligned with either a side or a diagonal of the dodecagon. That means the sides of the rectangle are either edges of the dodecagon or lines connecting non-adjacent vertices (diagonals).

I remember that in regular polygons, especially those with sides that are multiples of 4 (like a square, octagon, dodecagon), you can form rectangles by selecting pairs of parallel sides or diagonals. So, in a dodecagon, since it's 12-sided, there should be multiple sets of parallel sides and diagonals.

Wait, but how do the diagonals work in a dodecagon? Let me think. Each vertex connects to 12 - 3 = 9 other vertices via diagonals (excluding itself and its two adjacent vertices). But not all diagonals are the same length. The length depends on how many vertices apart they are.

For a regular polygon, the diagonals can be categorized by the number of vertices they skip. In a dodecagon, the diagonals can be of different lengths depending on how many steps they take around the polygon. For example, a diagonal connecting two vertices with one vertex between them is shorter than one connecting with two vertices between, and so on.

So, in a regular dodecagon, for each vertex, there are diagonals that skip 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, ..., up to 5 vertices. Because skipping 6 vertices would just give the opposite vertex, which is the diameter of the circumscribed circle, and beyond that, it's symmetric.

But wait, in terms of directions, each diagonal direction is unique for a certain step. So, for step size 'k', the diagonals are parallel to each other in a certain direction. So, in a dodecagon, each step size corresponds to a unique direction for the diagonals.

In a regular polygon, the number of distinct directions for diagonals is equal to the floor of (n-1)/2. For n=12, that would be floor(11/2) = 5. So, five distinct diagonal directions, not counting the sides as diagonals. Wait, but I'm not sure. Let me think again.

Actually, no. The sides are
