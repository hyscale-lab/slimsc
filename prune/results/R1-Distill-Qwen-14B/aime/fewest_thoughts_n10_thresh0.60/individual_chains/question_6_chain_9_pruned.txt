Okay, so I need to find the number of intersections between the graphs of y = 4g(f(sin(2πx))) and x = 4g(f(cos(3πy))). Hmm, this looks a bit complicated, but I'll try to break it down step by step.

First, I should understand what the functions f(x) and g(x) are. The problem says f(x) = ||x| - 1/2| and g(x) = ||x| - 1/4|. So, both are absolute value functions inside another absolute value. Let me visualize these functions.

For f(x): Let's start with |x|, which is a V-shape graph. Then subtract 1/2, so it's |x| - 1/2. This shifts the graph down by 1/2. But then we take the absolute value again, so ||x| - 1/2|. That means any part of the graph that's below the x-axis after subtracting 1/2 will be reflected back up. So, this function will have a W-shape, I think. Let me sketch it mentally: the original |x| has a minimum at 0, then when we subtract 1/2, the minimum becomes -1/2, but taking absolute value again, the minimum is 0, and the points where |x| was 1/2 will now be peaks at 0. So, the graph of f(x) will have a V shape in the middle, with peaks at x = ±1/2.

Similarly, for g(x) = ||x| - 1/4|. Same idea: starting with |x|, subtract 1/4, then take absolute value. So, the original |x| is shifted down by 1/4, and then any negative parts are flipped. So, the graph will have a W-shape as well, but with smaller peaks. The points where |x| is 1/4 will be the peaks. So, g(x) will have a V at the center, with peaks at x = ±1/4.

Now, let's consider the composite functions. Starting with the innermost functions:

First, for y = 4g(f(sin(2πx))). Let's break it down:

1. Start with sin(2πx). The sine function has a period of 1, because the period of sin(kx) is 2π/k, so here k=2π, so period is 1. So, it's a sine wave that completes one full cycle every unit interval. The amplitude is 1, so it ranges from -1 to 1.

2. Next, apply f to the sine function: f(sin(2πx)) = ||sin(2πx)| - 1/2|. Let me think about this. Since sin(2πx) ranges between -1 and 1, |sin(2πx)| ranges between 0 and 1. So, |sin(2πx)| - 1/2 will range between -1/2 and 1/2. Taking the absolute value of that gives us ||sin(2πx)| - 1/2|, which will range between 0 and 1/2.

3. Then, apply g to the result: g(f(sin(2πx))) = || |sin(2πx)| - 1/2 | - 1/4 |. Let's see, the input to g is a value between 0 and 1/2. So, subtracting 1/4 from that, we get a range from -1/4 to 1/4. Taking the absolute value, the output will be between 0 and 1/4.

4. Finally, multiply by 4: y = 4 * g(...). So y = 4 * [something between 0 and 1/4], which means y ranges from 0 to 1.

Similarly, for the other equation, x = 4g(f(cos(3πy))). Let's analyze that:

1. Start with cos(3πy). The period of cos(ky) is 2π/k, so here k=3π, so period is 2/3. So, it completes 3 cycles between y=0 and y=2. The amplitude is 1, so ranges from -1 to 1.

2. Apply f to the cosine function: f(cos(3πy)) = ||cos(3πy)| - 1/2|. As before, |cos(3πy)| is between 0 and 1, so subtracting 1/2 gives between -1/2 and 1/2. Taking absolute value, it ranges between 0 and 1/2.

3. Apply g to the result: g(f(cos(3πy))) = || |cos(3πy)| - 1/2 | - 1/4 |. The input is between 0 and 1/2, so subtracting 1/4 gives between -1/4 and 1/4, and absolute value gives between 0 and 1/4.

4. Multiply by 4: x = 4 * g(...), so x ranges from 0 to 1.

So both equations y = 4g(f(sin(2πx))) and x = 4g(f(cos(3πy))) have outputs ranging from 0 to 1. So, the graphs are within the square [0,1] x [0,1].

Now, to find the number of intersections between these two graphs. Each intersection is a point (a, b) where y = 4g(f(sin(2πa))) = b and x = 4g(f(cos(3πb))) = a. So, we need to solve the system:

a = 4g(f(cos(3πb)))

b = 4g(f(sin(2πa)))

So, it's a system of equations in a and b. Since both a and b are between 0 and 1, we can think of this as a mapping within the unit square.

Given the complexity, maybe we can find solutions by considering the behavior of these functions. Let's consider how 4g(f(...)) behaves.

First, let's analyze 4g(f(z)) where z is either sin(2πx) or cos(3πy). So for any z in [-1,1], f(z) = ||z| - 1/2|, which is between 0 and 1/2. Then, g(f(z)) = ||f(z) - 1/4|.

Wait, for f(z) in [0, 1/2], subtracting 1/4 gives a value in [-1/4, 1/4]. Then taking absolute value, so g(f(z)) is in [0, 1/4]. Then, multiplying by 4, we get 4g(f(z)) in [0,1]. So, 4g(f(z)) is a function that takes any z ∈ [-1,1] and maps it into [0,1].

Let me try to find an expression for 4g(f(z)). Let's denote h(z) = 4g(f(z)). Let's compute h(z):

h(z) = 4 * || |z| - 1/2 | - 1/4 |.

Let me consider different cases based on the value of |z|.

Case 1: |z| ≤ 1/4.

Then, |z| - 1/2 is negative, so | |z| - 1/2 | = 1/2 - |z|.

Then, h(z) = 4 * | (1/2 - |z|) - 1/4 | = 4 * |1/4 - |z||.

Since 1/4 - |z| is positive because |z| ≤1/4, so |1/4 - |z|| = 1/4 - |z|.

Thus, h(z) = 4*(1/4 - |z|) = 1 - 4|z|.

Case 2: 1/4 < |z| ≤ 3/4.

Wait, wait, let's think again.

Wait, f(z) = | |z| - 1/2 |. So for |z| ≤ 1/2, f(z) = 1/2 - |z|.

For |z| > 1/2, f(z) = |z| - 1/2.

Then, g(f(z)) = | f(z) - 1/4 |.

So, depending on whether f(z) is greater than or less than 1/4.

So, let's break down:

Case 1: |z| ≤ 1/2.

Then f(z) = 1/2 - |z|. So, when is 1/2 - |z| ≥ 1/4? That is, when |z| ≤ 1/4.

So, for |z| ≤ 1/4: f(z) = 1/2 - |z| ≥ 1/4. So, g(f(z)) = | (1/2 - |z|) - 1/4 | = |1/4 - |z||.

Which is 1/4 - |z| since |z| ≤ 1/4.

Thus, h(z) =4*(1/4 - |z|) = 1 -4|z|.

For |z| between 1/4 and 1/2: f(z) = 1/2 - |z| < 1/4. So, g(f(z)) = |(1/2 - |z|) - 1/4| = |1/4 - |z|| = |z| - 1/4 (since |z| >1/4).

Thus, h(z) =4*(|z| -1/4) =4|z| -1.

Case 2: |z| > 1/2.

Then, f(z) = |z| -1/2. Now, when is |z| -1/2 ≥1/4? That is, |z| ≥ 3/4.

So, for |z| between 1/2 and 3/4: f(z) = |z| -1/2 <1/4. So, g(f(z)) = |(|z| -1/2) -1/4| = | |z| - 3/4 |.

Since |z| <3/4, this becomes 3/4 - |z|.

Thus, h(z) =4*(3/4 - |z|) =3 -4|z|.

For |z| ≥3/4: f(z)=|z| -1/2 ≥1/4, so g(f(z)) = ||z| -1/2 -1/4| = ||z| -3/4|.

Which is |z| -3/4 because |z| ≥ 3/4.

Thus, h(z) =4*(|z| -3/4) =4|z| -3.

So, putting it all together, h(z) =4g(f(z)) is defined as:

h(z) =
- 1 -4|z|, when |z| ≤1/4
- 4|z| -1, when 1/4 < |z| ≤1/2
- 3 -4|z|, when 1/2 < |z| ≤3/4
-4|z| -3, when |z| >3/4

But since z is sin(2πx) or cos(3πy), which are between -1 and 1, but |z| is between 0 and 1 because of the absolute value inside. Wait no, wait:

Wait, in our case, the function h
