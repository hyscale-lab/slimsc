Okay, so I have this geometry problem here. It says: Let triangle ABC have circumcenter O and incenter I with IA perpendicular to OI, circumradius 13, and inradius 6. We need to find AB · AC. Hmm, okay, let me try to figure this out step by step.

First, I remember that in a triangle, the circumradius (R) is related to the sides by the formula R = (a)/(2 sin A), where a is the length of the side opposite angle A. But wait, maybe that's not directly useful here. Alternatively, the formula for the area of a triangle is related to both the inradius (r) and the circumradius. The area can be expressed as r * s, where s is the semi-perimeter, and also as (a * b * c)/(4R), where a, b, c are the sides.

Given that the inradius r is 6 and the circumradius R is 13, maybe I can relate these somehow to find the sides or products of sides. But the problem is asking for AB · AC, which are two sides multiplied together. Let me denote AB as c, BC as a, and AC as b, following the standard notation where side a is opposite angle A, etc. Wait, actually, in standard notation, side a is opposite angle A, so that would be BC, side b opposite angle B is AC, and side c opposite angle C is AB. So, AB is c, AC is b, so we need to find b · c.

Given that, we need to find bc, maybe through some relations involving R, r, and other elements.

Also, the problem states that IA is perpendicular to OI. IA is the inradius from I to vertex A, and OI is the line from the incenter to the circumcenter. Hmm, that's an interesting condition. I don't recall a standard formula for when IA is perpendicular to OI, so maybe I need to derive some relationship from that.

Let me recall that in a triangle, the distance between the incenter (I) and circumcenter (O) is given by the formula OI = sqrt(R(R - 2r)). Plugging in the given values, R=13 and r=6, so OI = sqrt(13*(13 - 12)) = sqrt(13 * 1) = sqrt(13). So OI is sqrt(13). Okay, that's a useful piece of information.

Now, IA is perpendicular to OI. So, triangle OIA is a right-angled triangle at I. So, in triangle OIA, angle at I is 90 degrees. So, by Pythagoras theorem, OA² = OI² + IA². But OA is the circumradius, which is 13, so OA = 13.

So, 13² = (sqrt(13))² + IA². That means 169 = 13 + IA², so IA² = 156, so IA = sqrt(156) = 2*sqrt(39). So, the length of IA is 2√39.

Wait, IA is the length from the incenter to vertex A. I remember that the length of the inradius is given by r, which is 6, but IA is not the inradius; it's the distance from the incenter to the vertex. So, is there a formula for the length of IA?

Yes, I think there is. The formula for the distance from the incenter to a vertex is given by IA = (r)/(sin (A/2)). Wait, let me confirm that. So, in a triangle, the distance from the incenter to vertex A is IA = (r)/(sin (A/2)). Alternatively, I've also heard it expressed as IA = (2R sin (A/2)). Hmm, let me think.

Wait, another approach: using trigonometric identities in triangle AIO, which is right-angled at I. So, in triangle AIO, angle at I is 90 degrees. So, perhaps we can use trigonometric relations here.

Wait, let me try to recall. In triangle AIO, which is right-angled, the sides are OI = sqrt(13), IA = 2√39, and OA = 13. So, in this right triangle, we can find the angles or use some trigonometric identities.

Alternatively, perhaps I can relate angle A with this information. Let me think. Since triangle AIO is right-angled at I, then angle OAI is some angle, say θ, which is equal to 90 - angle AIO.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use vectors or coordinates, but that might complicate things.

Wait, perhaps it's better to use trigonometric identities in triangle AIO. Let me denote angle at A as angle BAC = α. Then, in triangle AIO, which is right-angled at I, we can relate angle at A to the sides.

Wait, in triangle AIO, angle at I is 90 degrees, so angle at O is 90 - angle at A, which is angle BAC. Wait, no, not necessarily. Hmm, maybe I should think in terms of vectors or coordinate geometry.

Alternatively, another approach: let's consider the Euler line, which connects the incenter and circumcenter, but in this case, they are not on a straight line because IA is perpendicular to OI. Wait, but the Euler line is the line connecting O and H (the orthocenter), but the incenter I is not necessarily on that line unless the triangle is equilateral, which it isn't here.

Alternatively, maybe it's better to set up coordinate system. Let me try that.

Let me place the circumcenter O at the origin (0,0). Then, the incenter I has coordinates somewhere in the plane. Let me assume that point I is at (h, k). Since we know that IA is perpendicular to OI, which is the vector from O to I, which is (h, k). The vector IA goes from I to A, which is (x_A - h, y_A - k). So, the dot product of vectors OI and IA should be zero.

So, OI · IA = 0. So, (h, k) · (x_A - h, y_A - k) = 0. Which simplifies to h(x_A - h) + k(y_A - k) = 0. So, h x_A - h² + k y_A - k² = 0. So, h x_A + k y_A = h² + k².

But since O is the circumradius at (0,0), point A lies on the circumcircle, so OA = 13. So, x_A² + y_A² = 13² = 169.

Hmm, but I'm not sure if this is getting me anywhere. Maybe I need a different approach.

Wait, earlier, I found that IA = 2√39. And I also know that IA = (r)/(sin (A/2)) = 6 / sin(A/2). So, 6 / sin(A/2) = 2√39. So, sin(A/2) = 6 / (2√39) = 3 / √39 = √39 / 13. Because 3 / √39 can be rationalized as (3√39)/39 = √39/13.

So, sin(A/2) = √39 /13. Then, cos(A/2) can be found using the identity sin²θ + cos²θ = 1. So, cos²(A/2) = 1 - (39/169) = (169 - 39)/169 = 130/169 = 10*13/(13*13) = 10/13. So, cos(A/2) = √(10/13) = √130 /13.

Also, in triangle ABC, the inradius r is related to the area and the semi-perimeter. The formula is r = area / s, where s is the semi-perimeter. And the area can also be written as (a b c)/(4 R). So, maybe I can express r in terms of the sides.

We have r = 6, R =13.

So, area = r * s = 6 s.

Also, area = (a b c)/(4 *13) = (a b c)/52.

Therefore, 6 s = (a b c)/52 => a b c = 312 s.

Hmm, but not sure if that helps directly.

Alternatively, another formula: The distance from the inradius to a vertex can be expressed as IA = (r)/(sin(A/2)) = (6)/(√39/13) )= 6 * 13 /√39 = 78 / √39 = 78√39 /39 = 2√39. Which matches what we found earlier, so that's consistent.

So, maybe we can find cos A using the double-angle formula. Since we have sin(A/2) and cos(A/2).

So, cos A = 1 - 2 sin²(A/2) = 1 - 2*(39/169) = 1 - 78/169 = (169 -78)/169 = 91/169 = 7*13 / (13*13) = 7/13.

Wait, wait, that's not correct. Wait, wait, the formula is cos A = 1 - 2 sin²(A/2). So, sin(A/2) is √39 /13, so sin² is 39/169. So, 2 sin² is 78/169. So, cos A = 1 - 78/169 = (169 -78)/169 = 91/169. Simplifying, 91 is 13*7, 169 is 13², so 91/169 = 7/13. So, cos A = 7/13.

So, angle A has cosine 7/13, so sin A can be found as sqrt(1 - (49/169)) = sqrt(120/169) = (2*sqrt(30))/13.

So, sin A = 2√30 /13.

Now, in triangle ABC, using the formula for the area: area = (1/2)ab sin C. Wait, but in our case, if we're looking at angle A, the area can also be written as (1/2)*b*c*sin A. So, area = (1/2)*b*c*(2√30 /13) = (b c √30)/13.

But we also have area = r*s =6 s.

So, 6 s = (b c √30)/13 => b c = (6 s *13)/√30 = (78 s)/√30.

But we need to find bc, so if we can find s, we can find bc.

Alternatively, maybe we can find s in terms of the sides.

Wait, the semi-perimeter s = (a + b + c)/2.

Also, from the formula a = 2 R sin A, which is a = 2*13*(2√30 /13) )= 2*13*(2√30)/13, the 13 cancels out, so a = 4√30.

Wait, hold on: a is the side opposite angle A, so a = BC = 2 R sin A. Wait, sin A is 2√30 /13, so a = 2*13*(2√30 /13) )= 4√30. So, a =4√30.

So, side BC is 4√30.

So, now, we have a =4√30.

We also can find other sides using the Law of Sines. So, b = AC = 2 R sin B = 2*13 sin B. Similarly, c = AB = 2*13 sin C.

But since in a triangle, angles sum to 180 degrees, we have A + B + C = π. So, maybe we can find relations between angles.

Alternatively, maybe we can express s in terms of the sides.

Wait, s = (a + b + c)/2 = (4√30 + 2*13 sin B + 2*13 sin C)/2.

But this seems complicated. Maybe another approach.

Wait, from the inradius formula, we have area = r*s =6 s.

And from the area formula, area = (b c sin A)/2 = (b c * (2√30/13))/2 = (b c √30)/13.

So, setting equal: 6 s = (b c √30)/13 => b c = (6 s *13)/√30 = (78 s)/√30.

We can write this as bc = (78 /√30 ) s.

But s = (a + b + c)/2 = (4√30 + b + c)/2.

So, substituting:

bc = (78 /√30 ) * (4√30 + b + c)/2 = (78 /√30 ) * (4√30)/2 + (78 /√30 )*(b + c)/2.

Simplify:

First term: (78 /√30 ) * (4√30)/2 = (78 *4√30 )/(√30 *2) )= (78 *4 ) /2 = 78*2=156.

Second term: (78 /√30 )*(b + c)/2 = (78 (b + c))/(2√30 ) = (39 (b + c))/√30.

So, bc =156 + (39 (b + c))/√30.

Hmm, now, let me denote S = b + c and P = bc, so we have:

P = 156 + (39 S)/√30.

But I don't know if this substitution helps. Perhaps not directly. Maybe another formula.

Wait, from the Law of Cosines, in triangle ABC, a² = b² + c² - 2 b c cos A.

We have a =4√30, so a² = (4√30 )²=16*30=480.

And cos A =7/13, so:

480 = b² + c² - 2 b c*(7/13).

So, 480 = b² + c² - (14/13) bc.

Hmm, okay, so we have an equation involving b² + c² and bc.

Earlier, we had bc =156 + (39 S)/√30, but S = b + c.

Let me see if I can relate b² + c² to S and P (where P = bc).

Because, b² + c² = (b + c)^2 - 2 bc = S² - 2P.

So, substituting into the Law of Cosines equation:

480 = (S² - 2P) - (14/13) P.

So, 480 = S² - 2P - (14/13) P.

Combining the P terms:

-2P = -26/13 P, so -26/13 P -14/13 P = -40/13 P.

So, 480 = S² - (40/13) P.

So, 480 = S² - (40/13) P.

But from earlier, bc = P =156 + (39 S)/√30.

Hmm, so substituting P into this equation:

480 = S² - (40/13)(156 + (39 S)/√30 ).

Let me compute (40/13)(156) first.

(40/13)*156 = (40)*(156/13) = 40*(12) = 480.

Similarly, (40/13)*(39 S)/√30 = (40 *39 S)/(13√30 )= (40 *3 S)/√30 = (120 S)/√30.

So, putting it together:

480 = S² - [480 + (120 S)/√30 ]

So, bring the 480 to the left:

480 -480 = S² - (120 S)/√30.

So, 0 = S² - (120 S)/√30.

Thus, S² = (120 S)/√30.

Assuming S ≠0 (which it isn't, since sides are positive), we can divide both sides by S:

S = 120 /√30.

Simplify 120 /√30:

120 /√30 = (120√30)/30 =4√30.

So, S =4√30.

But S =b + c, so b + c =4√30.

Wait, but we have a =4√30 as well, which is side BC. So, that's interesting.

So, in triangle ABC, side BC is 4√30, and sides AB + AC =4√30.

Wait, that seems like a degenerate triangle, but no, because in a triangle, the sum of any two sides must be greater than the third. So, if AB + AC = BC, that would mean it's degenerate. So, that can't be correct. Hmm, so I must have made a mistake somewhere.

Wait, let me double-check the steps.

We had:

From the Law of Cosines: 480 = b² + c² - (14/13) bc.

Expressed as 480 = S² - 2P - (14/13) P = S² - (40/13) P.

Then, since P = bc =156 + (39 S)/√30.

Substituting into the equation:

480 = S² - (40/13)(156 + (39 S)/√30 )

Compute (40/13)*156: 40*12=480.

(40/13)*(39 S)/√30 = (40*3 S)/√30=120 S/√30.

Thus, 480 = S² - [480 + (120 S)/√30 ]

So, 480 = S² -480 - (120 S)/√30.

Bring 480 to left: 0 = S² - (120 S)/√30 - 960.

Wait, wait, I think I made a mistake here. When I subtract 480 from both sides, it's:

480 = S² - 480 - (120 S)/√30.

So, 480 +480 = S² - (120 S)/√30.

So, 960 = S² - (120 S)/√30.

So, S² - (120 S)/√30 -960 =0.

This is a quadratic in S.

Let me write it as S² - (120 /√30 ) S -960 =0.

Simplify 120/√30: 120/√30 = (120√30)/30 = 4√30.

So, the equation becomes:

S² -4√30 S -960 =0.

We can solve this quadratic for S.

Using quadratic formula: S = [4√30 ± sqrt( (4√30 )² +4*960 ) ] /2.

Compute discriminant:

(4√30 )² =16*30=480.

4*960=3840.

So, sqrt(480 +3840)=sqrt(4320)=sqrt(16*270)=4 sqrt(270)=4*sqrt(9*30)=4*3*sqrt(30)=12 sqrt(30).

So, S = [4√30 ±12√30 ] /2.

Which gives two solutions:

(4√30 +12√30)/2 =16√30 /2=8√30,

and

(4√30 -12√30)/2=(-8√30)/2=-4√30.

But since S is the sum of sides b and c, it can't be negative, so S=8√30.

So, b + c=8√30.

Earlier, we had P= bc=156 + (39 S)/√30.

So, substituting S=8√30,

P=156 + (39 *8√30 )/√30 =156 + 39*8=156 +312=468.

So, bc=468.

Wait, but the problem asks for AB · AC, which is c · b, so bc=468.

So, the answer is 468.

Wait, let me just verify all the steps again to make sure no mistakes were made.

1. OI = sqrt(R(R-2r))=sqrt(13*(13-12))=sqrt(13).

2. IA=2*sqrt(39), as found via Pythagoras in triangle AIO.

3. IA=6/sin(A/2)=> sin(A/2)=6/(2*sqrt(39))=sqrt(39)/13.

4. cos(A/2)=sqrt(10/13).

5. cos A=1-2 sin^2(A/2)=1-2*(39/169)=1-78/169=91/169=7/13.

6. Law of Cosines: a²=480= b² +c² - (14/13) bc.

7. Expressed bc in terms of s and then related to S =b +c.

8. Reached quadratic equation in S, solved to get S=8√30.

9. Substituted back to find bc=468.

So, all steps seem correct, so the answer is 468.


To solve the problem, we start by noting the given conditions: the circumradius \( R = 13 \), the inradius \( r = 6 \), and \( \overline{IA} \perp \overline{OI} \). The goal is to find \( AB \cdot AC \).

1. **Distance between Incenter and Circumcenter**:
   Using the formula \( OI = \sqrt{R(R - 2r)} \), we calculate:
   \[
   OI = \sqrt{13(13 - 12)} = \sqrt{13}.
   \]

2. **Length of \( IA \)**:
   Since \( \triangle AIO \) is right-angled at \( I \), by Pythagoras:
   \[
   OA^2 = OI^2 + IA^2 \implies 13^2 = (\sqrt{13})^2 + IA^2 \implies IA^2 = 156 \implies IA = 2\sqrt{39}.
   \]

3. **Relating \( IA \) to \( \sin(A/2) \)**:
   The length \( IA \) is given by \( IA = \frac{r}{\sin(A/2)} \). Substituting \( IA = 2\sqrt{39} \) and \( r = 6 \):
   \[
   2\sqrt{39} = \frac{6}{\sin(A/2)} \implies \sin(A/2) = \frac{\sqrt{39}}{13}.
   \]
   Using \( \cos(A/2) = \sqrt{1 - \sin^2(A/2)} \):
   \[
   \cos(A/2) = \sqrt{\frac{10}{13}} = \frac{\sqrt{130}}{13}.
   \]

4. **Finding \( \cos A \)**:
   Using the double-angle formula:
   \[
   \cos A = 1 - 2\sin^2(A/2) = 1 - 2\left(\frac{39}{169}\right) = \frac{7}{13}.
   \]

5. **Law of Cosines**:
   For side \( a = BC \) opposite angle \( A \):
   \[
   a^2 = b^2 + c^2 - 2bc \cos A.
   \]
   Since \( a = 2R \sin A = 4\sqrt{30} \), we have \( a^2 = 480 \).

6. **Expressing \( bc \) in Terms of Semi-perimeter**:
   The semi-perimeter \( s = \frac{a + b + c}{2} \). Using the area relations:
   \[
   \text{Area} = r \cdot s = 6s = \frac{1}{2} bc \sin A \implies bc = \frac{12s \cdot 13}{\sqrt{30}}.
   \]
   Substituting \( a = 4\sqrt{30} \) and solving for \( b + c \) leads to a quadratic equation in \( S = b + c \):
   \[
   S^2 - \frac{120 S}{\sqrt{30}} - 960 = 0.
   \]
   Solving this quadratic gives \( S = 8\sqrt{30} \).

7. **Final Calculation**:
   Substituting \( S = 8\sqrt{30} \) back into the expression for \( bc \):
   \[
   bc = 156 + \frac{39 \cdot 8\sqrt{30}}{\sqrt{30}} = 156 + 312 = 468.
   \]

Thus, the product \( AB \cdot AC \) is \(\boxed{468}\).
