Alright, so I have this problem where Alice chooses a set A of positive integers. Then Bob lists all finite nonempty sets B of positive integers such that the maximum element of B is in A. Bob's list has 2024 sets. I need to find the sum of the elements of A.

Hmm, let me break this down. So, A is some set of positive integers. Bob is creating sets B where each B is finite, nonempty, and the maximum element of B is in A. The total number of such B sets is 2024. My task is to find the sum of the elements in A.

Okay, maybe I should think about how Bob is creating these sets. For each element m in A, Bob can create sets where m is the maximum. So, for each m, the number of possible sets B where m is the maximum is equal to the number of subsets of {1, 2, ..., m-1} because each such subset can be combined with m to form a set where m is the maximum.

Wait, but each set B must be non-empty. So for each m, the number of possible B sets with maximum m is 2^{m-1}, because each element less than m can either be included or not. But since the set B must be non-empty, and m is included, we don't have the empty set. So, the total number of sets for each m is indeed 2^{m-1}.

So, suppose that A has elements {a1, a2, ..., an}, where a1 < a2 < ... < an. Then the total number of sets B is the sum over each a_i of 2^{a_i - 1}. Because for each a_i, there are 2^{a_i -1} possible subsets (including the empty subset, but since each B must include a_i, the subsets are non-empty when combined with a_i. Wait, no, actually, when considering subsets of {1,2,...,a_i-1}, the number of subsets is 2^{a_i-1}, and each of these subsets combined with a_i forms a unique set B where the maximum is a_i. So yes, each a_i contributes 2^{a_i -1} sets.

So, the total number of sets Bob has is the sum_{a in A} 2^{a -1} = 2024.

Therefore, the problem reduces to finding a set A such that the sum of 2^{a -1} over all a in A is equal to 2024.

Now, I need to find such a set A. My goal is to find A such that sum_{a in A} 2^{a -1} = 2024, and then compute the sum of elements in A.

Hmm, okay. So, 2^{a-1} is a geometric progression. Let me think about how to express 2024 as a sum of terms like 2^{a-1} where a are positive integers, possibly unique or not?

Wait, but each a has to be unique because A is a set, so no duplicate elements. Therefore, each a is unique, so each
