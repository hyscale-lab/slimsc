Okay, so I have this math problem here. Let me read it again to make sure I understand what's being asked.

"Let p be the least prime number for which there exists a positive integer n such that n^4 + 1 is divisible by p^2. Find the least positive integer m such that m^4 + 1 is divisible by p^2."

Alright, so I need to find the smallest prime p where n^4 + 1 is divisible by p squared for some n. Then, once I find that p, I have to find the smallest m where m^4 + 1 is divisible by p squared.

Hmm. So, first step is to find the smallest prime p with that property. Then, with that p, find the minimal m.

Let me think about how to approach this. Maybe I should start by testing small primes and see if any of them satisfy the condition that n^4 ≡ -1 mod p^2 for some n.

Starting with the smallest primes: 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, etc.

Let me check p=2 first. If p=2, then p^2=4. So, n^4 +1 must be divisible by 4. Let's see what n^4 mod 4 is.

n can be either 0,1,2,3 mod 4.

0^4 = 0 mod 4, so 0 +1 =1 mod 4. Not divisible by 4.

1^4=1 mod4, 1+1=2 mod4. Not divisible by 4.

2^4=16 mod4=0, 0+1=1 mod4.

3^4=81 mod4=1, 1+1=2 mod4.

So n^4 +1 is either 1 or 2 mod4, never 0. So p=2 doesn't work.

Next prime: p=3. Let's check if there exists n such that n^4 ≡ -1 mod9.

Compute n^4 mod9 for n=1 to 8.

n=1: 1^4=1 → 1+1=2 mod9 → not 0.
n=2: 16 mod9=7 → 7+1=8 mod9 → nope.
n=3: 81 mod9=0 → 0+1=1 → no.
n=4: 256 mod9. Let's compute 4^4: 256. 256 /9: 9*28=252, 256-252=4 → 4 mod9. 4+1=5 → no.
n=5: 5^4=625. 625 mod9: 625 - 9*69=625-621=4 → 4 mod9. 4+1=5 → no.
n=6: 6^4=1296 → 0 mod9. 0+1=1 → no.
n=7: 7^4=2401. Let's compute 2401 mod9. 2+4+0+1=7, which mod9 is 7. So 7^4 ≡7 mod9. 7 +1=8→ no.
n=8: 8^4=4096. Let's mod9: 4+0+9+6=19, mod9: 19-18=1. So 8^4 ≡1 mod9. 1+1=2→ no.

So for p=3, no n satisfies n^4 ≡-1 mod9. So p=3 is out.

Next prime: p=5.

Check if there's an n with n^4 ≡-1 mod25.

We need to find n such that n^4 ≡24 mod25.

Compute n^4 mod25 for n from 1 to 24. But that's a lot. Maybe smarter.

Alternatively, consider that n must satisfy n^4 ≡ -1 mod5 first. Because if n^4 ≡-1 mod25, then it must satisfy n^4 ≡-1 mod5. So let's see if n^4 ≡-1 mod5 is possible.

Compute n^4 mod5 for n=1,2,3,4.

n=1:1, n=2:16=1, n=3:81=1, n=4:256=1 mod5. So n^4 ≡1 mod5 for any n not a multiple of 5.

So n^4 ≡1 mod5. But we need n^4≡-1 mod5, which is 4 mod5. Since 1≡1, not 4. So no solution mod5, meaning no n exists such that n^4 ≡-1 mod25. So p=5 is out.

Wait, but wait: n must be coprime to p, which is 5, so n can't be a multiple of 5. So in mod5, n^4 is 1, which can't be -1. So p=5 doesn't work.

Next prime: p=7.

Check if n^4 ≡-1 mod49 exists.

Again, first check mod7. So n^4 ≡-1 mod7. Let's see what possible values n^4 can take mod7.

Compute n^4 mod7 for n=1 to6.

n=1:1, n=2:16=2 mod7. n=3:81=4 mod7. n=4:256=4 mod7. n=5:625=2 mod7. n=6:1296=1 mod7.

So n^4 mod7 can be 1,2,4.

Looking for n^4 ≡-1 mod7, which is 6 mod7. None of the residues are 6. So no solution mod7. Therefore, n^4 can't be ≡-1 mod49, so p=7 is out.

Next prime: p=11.

Wait, but maybe I should check p=13 or something. Alternatively, maybe p=17? Wait, perhaps I should think differently.

Wait, perhaps I can think about primes where -1 is a quartic residue mod p. For n^4 ≡-1 mod p to have a solution, -1 must be a quartic residue mod p. That requires that the order of -1 modulo p divides (p-1)/gcd(4, p-1).

Wait, the multiplicative order of -1 is 2, so for -1 to be a quartic residue, 2 must divide (p-1)/gcd(4, p-1). Hmm, maybe this is getting too abstract.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to
