Okay, so I have this problem about a torus and a sphere, and I need to find the difference between the radii of the circles where they are internally and externally tangent. Hmm, let me try to visualize this.

First, the torus T is created by revolving a circle of radius 3 around an axis in its plane, which is 6 units away from the center of the circle. So, imagine taking a circle, like a hula hoop, and spinning it around a stick that's 6 units away from the center of the hoop. That forms a donut shape, right? So, the torus has a major radius (the distance from the center of the tube to the center of the torus) of 6, and a minor radius (the radius of the tube itself) of 3. 

The sphere S has a radius of 11. So, it's a pretty big sphere, bigger than the torus. Now, when the torus rests on the inside of the sphere, it's internally tangent along a circle, and when it rests on the outside, it's externally tangent along another circle. We need to find the radii of these two circles, r_i and r_o, and then find the difference r_i - r_o, expressed as a reduced fraction m/n, and then m + n.

I think I need to recall how tangency works between a sphere and a torus. When two surfaces are tangent, their tangent planes at the point of contact are the same. But since the torus is a surface of revolution, maybe there's a way to model this using circles.

Let me think about the case when the torus is inside the sphere. The sphere has radius 11, and the torus is inside it. The point of tangency would be a circle on both the sphere and the torus.

Wait, the torus is a surface, so the internal and external tangent circles would lie on the surfaces. But perhaps we can model this by considering the centers of these tangent circles.

Wait, maybe I should model this in terms of the centers of the torus and sphere. The sphere is centered at some point, and the torus is also centered at that same point if it's resting symmetrically inside or outside. Hmm, is that the case?

Wait, when the torus is inside the sphere, it's touching along a circle, which would be a latitude line on the torus. Similarly, when it's outside, the external tangent would also be a circle on the torus.

Wait, perhaps it's better to model the torus in a coordinate system where the axis of revolution is the z-axis. So, the torus can be represented in cylindrical coordinates (r, θ, z) where r is the radial distance from the z-axis.

The standard equation for a torus with major radius R and minor radius a is:

(√(x² + y²) - R)² + z² = a²

In this case, R is 6 and a is 3. So, the equation becomes:

(√(x² + y²) - 6)² + z² = 9

Now, the sphere S has radius 11. Let
