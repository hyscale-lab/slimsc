Okay, so I need to solve this geometry problem about a tetrahedron. Let me read it again carefully.

We have a tetrahedron ABCD with specific edge lengths: AB and CD are both √41, AC and BD are √80, and BC and AD are √89. There's a point I inside the tetrahedron such that the distances from I to each of the four faces are all equal. We need to find this distance, which can be written in the form m√n / p, where m, n, p are positive integers, m and p are coprime, and n is square-free. Then we have to find m + n + p.

Hmm, okay. The point I is equidistant from all four faces, which reminds me of the incenter in a triangle, but in 3D. So in a tetrahedron, the incenter is the center of the inscribed sphere (inradius) that is tangent to all four faces. So the distance we're looking for is the inradius.

So, to find the inradius, I think I need to find the volume of the tetrahedron and the total surface area. The formula for the inradius r is 3V divided by the total surface area A, right? Because in a tetrahedron, the inradius times the total surface area gives three times the volume. So, r = 3V / A.

Wait, let me confirm that. In a tetrahedron, the volume V can be expressed as (1/3) * A * r, where A is the total area of all four faces. So, rearranging that, r = 3V / A. Yes, that seems correct.

So, I need to compute V and A.

First, let's try to visualize the tetrahedron. All opposite edges are equal: AB = CD, AC = BD, AD = BC. That suggests that this is a kind of "balanced" tetrahedron, maybe a disphenoid. A disphenoid is a tetrahedron where opposite edges are equal, and all faces are congruent triangles. Wait, but in this case, all the opposite edges are equal, but are all the faces congruent?

Wait, let me check the edge lengths:

AB = CD = √41,

AC = BD = √80,

AD = BC = √89.

So each pair of opposite edges has the same length. So yes, it's a disphenoid. Therefore, all four faces should be congruent triangles, right? Because each face is a triangle with edges of lengths √41, √80, √89. Hmm, wait, no. Wait, each face is a triangle. Let me see: for example, face ABC has edges AB, BC, and AC. AB is √41, BC is √89, AC is √80. Similarly, face ABD has edges AB, BD, AD. AB is √41, BD is √80, AD is √89. So yes, each face is a triangle with sides √41, √80, √89. So all four faces are congruent triangles. That's useful because it means each face has the same area, which might simplify calculations.

So, if all four faces are congruent, then the total surface area A is four times the area of one face. So, if I can compute the area of one face, then multiply by four to get A.

So, let's compute the area of one face. Let's take triangle ABC with sides a = √41, b = √80, c = √89.

Wait, let me write down the sides:

a = √41 ≈ 6.403,

b = √80 ≈ 8.944,

c = √89 ≈ 9.434.

So, it's a triangle with sides approximately 6.4, 8.9, and 9.4. Let
