Okay, so I have this math problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again:

We need to find the greatest four-digit positive integer, N, such that whenever one of its digits is changed to 1, the resulting number is divisible by 7. Then, when N is divided by 1000, we get Q (the quotient) and R (the remainder). We need to find Q + R.

Hmm, okay. So N is a four-digit number, which means it's between 1000 and 9999. We have to find the largest such N with this specific property. The property is that if you change any one of its digits to 1, the new number is divisible by 7.

Let me break this down. Let's represent N as a four-digit number: N = ABCD, where A, B, C, D are its digits. So, A is the thousands digit, B is hundreds, C is tens, and D is ones.

The problem states that changing any one digit to 1 results in a number divisible by 7. So, for example, if I change A to 1, getting 1BCD, that number should be divisible by 7. Similarly, changing B to 1 gives A1CD, which should also be divisible by 7, and so on for changing C or D to 1.

So, all four possible single-digit changes to 1 must result in numbers divisible by 7. Our goal is to find the largest such N.

I think the approach should be to consider what each digit change implies about the original number N. Since changing each digit to 1 gives a number divisible by 7, we can write equations for each of these cases and then solve for N.

Let me define N as 1000*A + 100*B + 10*C + D.

When we change the thousands digit to 1, the number becomes 1000*1 + 100*B + 10*C + D = 1000 + 100B + 10C + D. Let's call this N1.

Similarly, changing the hundreds digit to 1 gives 1000*A + 100*1 + 10*C + D = 1000A + 100 + 10C + D. Let's call this N2.

Changing the tens digit to 1 gives 1000*A + 100*B + 10*1 + D = 1000A + 100B + 10 + D. Let's call this N3.

Changing the ones digit to 1 gives 1000*A + 100*B + 10*C + 1 = 1000A + 100B + 10C + 1. Let's call this N4.

Each of these numbers N1, N2, N3, N4 must be divisible by 7. So, N1 ≡ 0 mod 7, N2 ≡ 0 mod 7, N3 ≡ 0 mod 7, N4 ≡ 0 mod 7.

Since N is the original number, can we find some relationships between N and these modified numbers?

Let me compute N1 - N = (1000 + 100B + 10C + D) - (1000A + 100B + 10C + D) = 1000(1 - A) + 0 + 0 + 0 = 1000(1 - A).

Similarly, N2 - N = (1000A + 100 + 10C + D) - (1000A + 100B + 10C + D) = 100(1 - B).

N3 - N = (1000A + 100B + 10 + D) - N = 10(1 - C).

N4 - N = (1000A + 100B + 10C + 1) - N = 1 - D.

Since N1, N2, N3, N4 are all divisible by 7, and N is the original number, perhaps we can find conditions on N.

Wait, if N1 ≡ 0 mod 7, then N1 = 7*k1 for some integer k1. Similarly for the others.

But N1 = N - (1000A - 1000). So, N1 ≡ 0 mod 7 => N - (1000A - 1000) ≡ 0 mod 7. So, N ≡ 1000A - 1000 mod 7.

But 1000 ≡ ? mod 7. Let me compute 1000 divided by 7. 7*142=994, so 1000-994=6. So 1000 ≡ 6 mod 7.

So, 1000A ≡ 6A mod 7. Similarly, 1000 ≡ 6 mod 7.

Thus, N ≡ 6A - 6 mod 7.

Similarly, let's compute the other cases.

For N2: N2 = N + (100 - 100B). So N2 ≡ 0 mod 7 => N + (100 - 100B) ≡ 0 mod 7.

100 mod 7: 100 /7=14*7=98, so 100 ≡ 2 mod7. So 100 - 100B ≡ 2(1 - B) mod7.

Thus, N ≡ -2(1 - B) mod7 => N ≡ 2(B -1) mod7.

Similarly, for N3: N3 = N + (10 - 10C). So N3 ≡ 0 mod7 => N + (10 - 10C) ≡ 0 mod7.

10 mod7 is 3, so 10 -10C ≡ 3(1 - C) mod7.

Thus, N ≡ -3(1 - C) mod7 => N ≡ 3(C -1) mod7.

For N4: N4 = N + (1 - D). So N4 ≡ 0 mod7 => N + (1 - D) ≡ 0 mod7.

So, N ≡ D -1 mod7.

So, putting it all together, we have four conditions:

1. N ≡ 6A -6 mod7.

2. N ≡ 2(B -1) mod7.

3. N ≡ 3(C -1) mod7.

4. N ≡ (D -1) mod7.

These four congruences must all be satisfied by N. Additionally, since all four conditions must hold, N must be congruent to each of these expressions modulo 7. Therefore, all four expressions must be congruent to each other modulo 7.

So, 6A -6 ≡ 2(B -1) ≡ 3(C -1) ≡ D -1 mod7.

This is a system of congruences that we can solve.

So, we have:

6A -6 ≡ 2(B -1) mod7,

2(B -1) ≡ 3(C -1) mod7,

3(C -1) ≡ D -1 mod7.

We can write these as:

1. 6A -6 = 2B -2 mod7 => 6A -2B = 4 mod7.

2. 2B -2 = 3C -3 mod7 => 2B -3C = -1 mod7 => 2B -3C = 6 mod7.

3. 3C -3 = D -1 mod7 => 3C - D = 2 mod7.

So, three equations:

1. 6A -2B ≡4 mod7.

2. 2B -3C ≡6 mod7.

3. 3C - D ≡2 mod7.

We can try to express these equations in terms of each variable, perhaps.

Let me note that 6 ≡ -1 mod7, so 6A ≡ -A mod7.

So equation 1 becomes:

- A - 2B ≡4 mod7 => -A -2B ≡4 => A + 2B ≡ -4 mod7 => A + 2B ≡3 mod7.

Similarly, equation 2: 2B -3C ≡6 mod7.

Equation 3: 3C - D ≡2 mod7.

So, now we have:

Equation 1: A + 2B ≡3 mod7.

Equation 2: 2B -3C ≡6 mod7.

Equation 3: 3C - D ≡2 mod7.

I think it's helpful to express each variable in terms of the next.

From equation 1: A ≡3 - 2B mod7.

From equation 2: 2B ≡6 + 3C mod7.

From equation 3: D ≡3C -2 mod7.

Let me see if I can substitute variables.

From equation 2: 2B ≡6 + 3C mod7.

Let me solve for B
