Okay, so I've got this math problem here. Let me try to figure it out step by step. I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of these kinds of problems, but I'll do my best.

The problem says: There's a list of positive integers with three properties. First, their sum is 30. Second, the unique mode is 9. Third, the median is a positive integer that doesn't appear in the list. I need to find the sum of the squares of all the items in the list.

Hmm, let's break this down. I'll start by recalling what each term means.

Mode: The mode is the number that appears most frequently in the list. And it's unique, meaning no other number appears as many times as 9.

Median: The median is the middle number when the numbers are arranged in order. If there's an even number of items, it's the average of the two middle numbers. But here, the median is a positive integer that doesn't appear in the list. That's interesting.

Sum is 30. So all the numbers added together equal 30.

Okay, so I think the first thing to do is figure out the possible structure of the list. Let me think about the mode first.

Since 9 is the unique mode, it must appear more times than any other number. So, the number of 9s in the list has to be more than the count of any other number.

Let me denote the list as a sorted list because the median is involved, and order matters for that. So the list is in non-decreasing order.

Let me think about how many numbers are in the list. Wait, the problem doesn't specify the number of elements. That's a bit tricky. So I'll have to figure that out as part of the solution.

Let me think about possible lengths of the list.

The minimum number of elements possible is probably 2, but since 9 is the mode and it's unique, it must appear at least twice. So the list must have at least two 9s. Wait, no, because if the list has only two elements and both are 9, then the mode is 9, but then the median would be 9, which is in the list. But the problem says the median is a positive integer that does not appear in the list. So that can't be. So the list can't have two elements because then the median is 9, which would be in the list. So the list must have more than two elements.

Let me consider that the list has an odd number of elements first. Let's say it has 2k+1 elements. Then the median is the (k+1)th element. Since the median is not in the list, that element
