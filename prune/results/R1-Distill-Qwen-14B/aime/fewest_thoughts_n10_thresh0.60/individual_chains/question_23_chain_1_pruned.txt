Okay, so I have this math problem here about a hyperbola and a rhombus. Let me try to break it down step by step. 

The hyperbola is given by the equation x²/20 - y²/24 = 1. So, it's a standard hyperbola centered at the origin, opening to the left and right. The transverse axis is along the x-axis because the positive term is with x². 

The problem says that points A, B, C, D lie on this hyperbola, and ABCD is a rhombus with its diagonals intersecting at the origin. I need to find the greatest real number that is less than BD² for all such rhombi. That is, I need to find the infimum (the greatest lower bound) of BD² for all possible such rhombuses.

First, let me recall some properties of a rhombus. In a rhombus, all sides are equal, and the diagonals bisect each other at right angles. Wait, no, actually, the diagonals bisect each other but they don't necessarily intersect at right angles unless it's a square. Wait, no, actually, in a rhombus, the diagonals do bisect the angles and they intersect at right angles. Hmm, I might need to double-check that.

Wait, yes, in a rhombus, the diagonals are not equal but they do bisect each other at right angles. So, each diagonal cuts the other into two equal parts, and they intersect at 90 degrees. So, the diagonals are perpendicular
