Okay, so I have this math problem here. Let me read it again and try to understand what's being asked.

We have a list of positive integers with three properties:
1. The sum of all the items is 30.
2. The unique mode is 9. That means 9 appears more frequently than any other number in the list, and no other number has the same frequency as 9.
3. The median of the list is a positive integer that doesn't appear in the list itself.

And the question is asking for the sum of the squares of all the items in the list.

Hmm, okay. Let's break this down step by step.

First, let's recall some definitions. The mode is the number that appears most often. Unique mode means only 9 is the mode, so 9 appears more times than any other number. The median is the middle number when the list is ordered. If there's an even number of elements, the median is the average of the two middle numbers. But in this case, the median is a positive integer that doesn't appear in the list. That's interesting.

So, the list has positive integers, so all numbers are at least 1. The sum is 30.

Let me think about how to structure the list.

First, to have a unique mode of 9, 9 must appear more times than any other number. So, if the list has n elements, the count of 9s must be greater than the count of any other number.

Also, the median is a positive integer not in the list. So, if the list has an odd number of elements, the median is the middle element, which doesn't appear. If it's even, the median is the average of the two middle elements, which also doesn't appear.

Wait, but the median itself is a positive integer, so in the case of even number of elements, the average has to be an integer, which would imply that the two middle numbers are both that integer or both differing by 1? Hmm, no, because if the two middle numbers are consecutive, their average would be a non-integer. So, for the median to be an integer, the two middle numbers must be the same. But wait, if they are the same, then that number appears in the list, which contradicts the median not being in the list. So, that can't be. Therefore, perhaps the list has an odd number of elements. Because for an even number, the median would require two middle numbers that are the same, which is impossible because then the median would appear in the list. But the problem says the median is a positive integer that doesn't appear in the list. So, maybe the list has even number of elements, but the two middle numbers are such that their average is an integer not present in the list.

Wait, if the two middle numbers are consecutive, like 8 and 10, their average is 9, which is in the list. So that's a problem because 9 is the mode. Alternatively, if the two middle numbers are 7 and 11, their average is 9, which is in the list. Hmm, same issue. But wait, 9 is the mode, so it's already in the list. So for the median to not be present, the two middle numbers must have an average that is an integer not present in the list. But if the two middle numbers are not both 9, their average could be something else. Wait, but if the list has 9 as the mode, then it's possible that 9 is in the list, but the median is not.

Wait, perhaps the list has an even number of elements. Let's say n is even, so n=2k. Then the median is the average of the k-th and (k+1)-th elements. So, for that average to not be in the list, those two elements must add up to an integer not in the list.

But if 9 is the mode, it must appear more times than any other number. So, let's think about possible list lengths.

Let me consider possible list lengths. Let's say the list has m elements. Since the sum is 30, which is not too big, m can't be too large. Let's think about the minimum possible m.

The minimal number of elements would be when all elements are 1, except for the mode. But since 9 is the mode, it must appear more times. So, let's think about the minimal number of elements.

Suppose the list has 4 elements: for example, [9,9,9,3]. Sum is 9+9+9+3=30. Wait, that's 30. But let's check the median. For 4 elements, the median is the average of the 2nd and 3rd elements, which are both 9. So the median is 9, which is in the list. That doesn't satisfy the condition. So, the median must not be in the list.

So, in this case, if the list has 4 elements, and the two middle numbers are both 9, the median is 9, which is in the list. So that's no good. So, maybe the list has 5 elements. Let's see.

Wait, let's think about the number of 9s. Let's denote the count of 9s as c. Since 9 is the unique mode, c must be greater than the count of any other number. So, if other numbers appear at most c-1 times.

Suppose the list has 5 elements. Then, the median is the 3rd element. So, if the median is not present, the 3rd element is something not in the list. Wait, that can't be. Because the 3rd element is part of the list, so it must be present. So, the median is that element, which is in the list. So, that's a problem because the median is present.

So, the list cannot have an odd number of elements because then the median is an element in the list. So, the list must have an even number of elements. Because only then the median is the average of two elements, which may not be in the list.

So, let's assume n is even. Let's say n=6, 8, etc. Let's try n=6.

If n=6, then the median is the average of the 3rd and 4th elements. So, the average must be an integer not in the list.

Wait, but the average of two integers is an integer only if the two integers are both even or both odd. So, the 3rd and 4th elements must both be even or both be odd.

Let me try to construct such a list.

We need the sum to be 30. Let's think about how many 9s we need.

Since 9 is the mode, it must appear more than any other number. Let's say we have c 9s. Then, all other numbers can appear at most c-1 times.

So, for n=6, let's see:

If c=4, then the other two numbers can appear at most 3 times. But since n=6, if c=4, then the other two numbers must be 2 numbers. Wait, but if n=6, 4 are 9s, and the remaining 2 must be other numbers, each appearing once. So, in that case, the counts are 4,1,1, which is okay for the mode.

Alternatively, c=3. Then, other numbers can appear at most 2 times. So, with n=6, if we have 3 9s, the remaining 3 could be, say, two 1s and one 2, but that might complicate the median.

Wait, let's try to structure the list.

Let me try n=6. So, list has 6 elements. To make the sum 30, the average is 5. So, the numbers can't be too large or too small.

But 9 is the mode, so it must appear more than any other number. So, in n=6, to have 9 as the mode, it must appear at least 2 times (since if another number appears 2 times, 9 needs to appear more than that). Wait, no. Wait, mode is the most frequent. So, if 9 appears 2 times, and another number appears 2 times, then it's bimodal, right? So, to have a unique mode, 9 must appear at least 3 times.

So, for n=6, the minimum c is 3.

So, let's try c=3.

So, three 9s. The sum contributed by 9s is 3*9=27. The remaining sum is 30-27=3. We have 3 more elements, so each of the remaining elements must be 1, since 3/3=1. So, the list would be [9,9,9,1,1,1].

Wait, let's arrange it in order: [1,1,1,9,9,9]. The median is the average of the 3rd and 4th elements, which are 1 and 9. So, the median is (1+9)/2=5. 5 is an integer, and it's not in the list. Perfect! So, the median is 5, which is not in the list.

So, does this satisfy all conditions?

Sum: 9+9+9+1+1+1=27+3=30. Check.

Mode: 9 appears 3 times, others appear 3 times as well? Wait, wait, no. Wait, 1 appears 3 times, 9 appears 3 times. So, both 1 and 9 appear 3 times. So, that's bimodal. But the problem states the unique mode is 9. So, that's a problem. So, this list doesn't work because 1 and 9 both have the same count, making them both modes.

So, we need to adjust the counts. So, 9 must appear more than any other number. So, in n=6, if 9 appears 4 times, then the other two numbers can appear at most 3 times, but since n=6, if 9 appears 4 times, the remaining two must be two different numbers each appearing once. Wait, no, because 4+1+1=6. So, the other two numbers each appear once.

So, let's try that. 4 nines, and two other numbers, say 1 and 2.

So, the list is [1,2,9,9,9,9]. Let's arrange it in order: [1,2,9,9,9,9]. Wait, no, actually, sorted order would be [1,2,9,9,9,9]. Then, the median is the average of the 3rd and 4th elements, which are both 9. So, the median is 9, which is in the list. That's a problem because the median must not be in the list.

So, that doesn't work. So, perhaps we can't have n=6 with four 9s because the median would be 9, which is in the list.

Alternatively, let's try 4 nines and two other numbers, but arrange the list such that the median is something else. Wait, but for n=6, the 3rd and 4th elements determine the median. So, if we have four 9s, the 3rd and 4th elements are both 9, so the median is 9, which is in the list. So, that's no good.

So, perhaps we need to have more elements.

Let's try n=8.

If n=8, the median is the average of the 4th and 5th elements. So, if those two are different, the average could be an integer not in the list.

Let's see. Let's try to set up the list with 9 as the unique mode.

So, c must be greater than the count of any other number.

Suppose c=4. Then, other numbers can appear at most 3 times. But n=8, so if c=4, the remaining 4 numbers can be, for example, two 1s and two 2s, but that would make 1 and 2 appear twice each. So, 4 9s, two 1s, two 2s. But in that case, 9 is the unique mode because it appears 4 times, more than others.

Wait, let's check the sum. 4*9=36. But the total sum is 30. So 36 is already larger than 30, which is impossible. So, that won't work.

So, maybe c=3. Then, 3 9s, sum=27. The remaining 5 elements sum to 3. So, each of those must be 1s. So, 3 9s and 5 1s. But wait, 3+5=8, which is n=8.

But then, the mode would be 1 because it appears 5 times, while 9 appears 3 times. So, that's not acceptable because 9 needs to be the unique mode.

So, that's a problem. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe c=4, but with smaller numbers. Wait, but 4*9=36, which is more than 30. So, impossible.

So, perhaps n=8 is not possible. Let's try n=7.

Wait, n=7 is odd, so the median is the 4th element, which would be in the list. So, that's no good because the median must not be in the list.

So, perhaps n=10.

Wait, let me think: n=10, sum=30.

If n=10, the median is the average of the 5th and 6th elements. So, if those two add up to an even number, their average is an integer. Let's make that integer not present in the list.

So, let's try to set up the list with 9 as the unique mode.

Suppose c=4. Then, other numbers can appear at most 3 times. So, 4 9s, and the remaining 6 numbers.

Sum contributed by 9s: 4*9=36, which is already over 30. So, that's impossible.

So, c=3. Then, 3 9s, sum=27. Remaining 7 elements sum to 3. So, each of those is 1. So, 3 9s and 7 1s. But 7 1s would make 1 the mode, since it appears 7 times, which is more than 9's 3 times. So, that's no good.

So, perhaps c=5? 5*9=45, way over 30. So, no.

Hmm, maybe n=5.

Wait, n=5 is odd. So, the median is the 3rd element, which is in the list, so that's not acceptable.

So, perhaps n=7 is also out.

Wait, maybe n=8 is the way to go, but with smaller counts.

Wait, let's try n=8, c=3. Sum from 9s is 27. Remaining 5 elements sum to 3, so 5 1s. But then, as before, 1 appears 5 times, which is more than 9's 3. So, that won't work.

Alternatively, maybe have 9 appear 4 times, but that's too much because 4*9=36>30.

Hmm, this is tricky.

Wait, perhaps n=6, but with 9 appearing 3 times. Let me think again.

So, n=6, sum=30.

Three 9s: sum=27. Remaining 3 elements sum to 3. So, each is 1, making 3 1s. So, the list is [9,9,9,1,1,1].

But as I saw earlier, this list is [1,1,1,9,9,9]. The median is (1+9)/2=5, which is not in the list. But the mode is both 1 and 9, each appearing 3 times. So, that's bimodal, which violates the unique mode condition.

So, how can we make 9 the unique mode?

We need 9 to appear more times than any other number. So, perhaps we can adjust the list so that 9 appears 4 times, and other numbers appear at most 2 times.

Wait, but 4*9=36>30. So, can't do that.

Wait, maybe the other numbers besides 9 don't all have to be 1. Maybe some are 2 or higher.

Wait, let's try n=6.

If we have 4 9s, that's 36, which is over 30. So, can't do that.

Alternatively, 3 9s and 3 other numbers. Let's see.

Let me try 3 9s (sum 27) and 3 other numbers summing to 3. So, maybe two 1s and one 1, but that's 3 1s. But then 1 appears 3 times, same as 9. So, that's bimodal.

Alternatively, maybe two 1s and one 1, but that's the same as before.

Alternatively, have one 1 and two 2s. So, 1 + 2 + 2 = 5. But 27 +5=32>30. So, no.

Wait, wait, the remaining sum is 3. So, the other three numbers must sum to 3. So, they can be 1,1,1 or 1,2,0 but 0 is not allowed because they must be positive integers.

Wait, no, the problem says positive integers, so the numbers must be at least 1.

So, only possible way is 1,1,1. So, that brings us back to the earlier problem.

So, n=6 is giving me trouble because either the median is 9, which is present, or the modes are equal.

Hmm.

Wait, maybe the list has more elements, but the mode is 9 with less count.

Wait, another approach: maybe the list has 9s and other numbers with lower counts. Let me think about possible counts.

Suppose the list has n elements, and 9 appears k times, where k is the maximum frequency.

We need sum of all elements =30.

Also, median is an integer not in the list.

Let me think about possible n.

We saw that for even n, the median is average of two middle elements. So, for it to not be present, those two must add to twice a number not in the list.

Wait, perhaps n=7 is not working because it's odd.

Wait, perhaps n=8. Let's think again.

n=8, sum=30.

Let me try c=4 (9 appears 4 times). Sum from 9s=36>30, impossible.

So, c=3. So, 3 9s, sum=27. Remaining 5 elements sum to 3. So, 5 1s. But then, 1 appears 5 times, which is more than 3, so 1 is the mode. So, that's no good.

Alternatively, can I have other numbers besides 1?

Wait, 5 elements summing to 3. Since each is at least 1, the minimal sum is 5*1=5. But we need sum=3, which is less than 5. So, impossible. So, that approach won't work.

Wait, that's a problem. So, for n=8, with c=3, the remaining elements can't sum to 3 because they have to be at least 1 each. So, 5 elements need to sum to 3, which is impossible because 5*1=5>3.

So, maybe n=8 is not possible.

Hmm. Let's think of another approach.

Wait, perhaps n=5 is the only option? But n=5 is odd, so the median is in the list. So, that's not acceptable.

Wait, perhaps n=9.

Wait, n=9, sum=30.

If the list has 9 elements, the median is the 5th element, which is in the list. So, that's no good.

So, n=10: sum=30.

n=10, so the median is the average of the 5th and 6th elements.

Let me try c=3 for 9s. So, 3*9=27. Remaining 7 elements sum to 3.

Each of these 7 elements must be at least 1, so 7*1=7>3. So, impossible.

c=4: 4*9=36>30. No good.

So, n=10 is impossible.

Hmm. Wait, perhaps n=12.

n=12, sum=30.

Each element is at least 1, so minimal sum is 12. 30 is achievable.

If c=3, 3*9=27. Remaining 9 elements sum to 3. So, 9 elements each at least 1: 9*1=9. But 3<9, impossible.

c=2: 2*9=18. Remaining 10 elements sum to 12. So, 10 elements, sum=12. So, each is at least 1, so 10*1=10. 12-10=2. So, we can have 8 ones and two 2s. So, that's 8+2+2=12.

So, the list would be [9,9,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,2,2]. Wait, no, n=12, so 2 9s, 8 1s, and 2 2s. So, let's arrange in order: 1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,2,2,9,9.

Wait, no, wait, 2 9s, 8 1s, and 2 2s. So, the list is [1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,2,2,9,9].

Wait, no, that's 8+2+2=12. Wait, no, 8 ones, 2 twos, 2 nines: total is 12 elements.

So, sorted order: [1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,2,2,9,9].

Now, the median is the average of the 6th and 7th elements. The 6th element is 1, the 7th is 1. So, the median is (1+1)/2=1, which is in the list. So, that's no good.

Alternatively, arrange the list such that the 6th and 7th elements are different.

Wait, but with 8 ones, the first 8 elements are 1. Then, the next two are 2, then two 9s. So, positions 6 and 7 are both 1. Hmm, so the median is 1, which is present.

So, that won't work.

Alternatively, let's try to have the two middle numbers as 2 and something else.

Wait, but in this case, 2 is at the 9th and 10th positions, so the 6th and 7th are still 1.

Alternatively, maybe have more 2s. Let me see.

Wait, n=12, sum=30.

If I have c=3 for 9s: 3*9=27. Remaining sum=3. 9 elements left, sum=3. Each is at least 1, so 9*1=9>3. Impossible.

So, c=2 is the only possible.

Wait, but in that case, as above, the median is 1, which is in the list. So, that's not acceptable.

Hmm. Is there a way to have the two middle numbers not both 1?

Wait, maybe arrange the list with more numbers between 1 and 9.

Wait, let's try a different setup.

Let me try n=10.

Wait, n=10, sum=30.

If c=3: 3*9=27. Remaining 7 elements sum=3. 7 elements, each at least 1: 7*1=7. 3<7: impossible.

c=2: 2*9=18. Remaining 8 elements sum=12. 8 elements, each at least 1: 8*1=8. 12-8=4. So, we can have 4 elements as 2, and the rest as 1. So, 4 twos and 4 ones.

So, the list would be [1,1,1,1,2,2,2,2,9,9]. Sorted order.

So, the 5th and 6th elements are 2 and 2. So, the median is (2+2)/2=2, which is in the list. So, that's no good.

Alternatively, maybe have some 3s.

n=10, 2 9s, 8 other elements summing to 12.

Suppose 3 of them are 3, and the rest are 1. So, 3*3=9, and 5*1=5. 9+5=14>12. No good.

Alternatively, 2 threes and 6 ones: 2*3=6, 6*1=6. Sum=12. So, 2 threes, 6 ones, 2 nines.

So, the list is [1,1,1,1,1,1,3,3,9,9]. Sorted order.

The 5th and 6th elements are 1 and 1. So, median is 1, which is in the list. Not good.

Alternatively, arrange to have the two middle elements as 3 and something else.

Wait, but with 6 ones, 2 threes, and 2 nines, the sorted list is [1,1,1,1,1,1,3,3,9,9]. So, positions 5 and 6 are 1 and 1. So, median=1. Not good.

So, that approach doesn't work.

Hmm. Maybe try a different c.

Wait, for n=10, if c=4: 4*9=36>30. No good.

So, c=2 is the only option, but the median ends up being 1 or 2, which are in the list.

Wait, maybe we need to have higher numbers besides 9 and 1.

Wait, let's try n=7.

Wait, n=7 is odd, so median is the 4th element. Which is in the list. So, not acceptable.

Hmm. Maybe n=4.

Wait, n=4, sum=30.

If c=3: 3*9=27. Remaining 1 element: 3. So, the list is [9,9,9,3]. Sum=30.

Sorted: [3,9,9,9]. Median is (9+9)/2=9, which is in the list. So, no good.

Alternatively, c=2: 2*9=18. Remaining 2 elements sum to 12. Each must be at least 1. So, 12 can be split as 6 and 6, or 5 and 7, etc.

So, list could be [6,6,9,9]. Sorted: [6,6,9,9]. Median is (6+9)/2=7.5, which is not an integer. But the problem states the median is a positive integer. So, this doesn't work.

Alternatively, have the remaining two numbers sum to an even number. So, 12 can be split as 5 and 7, which sum to 12, but then (5+7)/2=6, which is an integer. So, the median is 6, which is not in the list.

So, the list is [5,7,9,9]. Sum:5+7+9+9=30. Check.

Mode: 9 appears twice, 5 and 7 appear once. So, mode is 9, unique. Check.

Median: (5+7)/2=6, which is not in the list. Check.

So, this seems to satisfy all conditions.

Wait, let me check again.

List: [5,7,9,9]. Sorted: [5,7,9,9].

Median is (7+9)/2? Wait, no: wait, n=4, so the median is the average of the 2nd and 3rd elements. 2nd is 7, 3rd is 9. So, (7+9)/2=8, which is an integer, not in the list. So, that works.

Sum is 5+7+9+9=30. Good.

Mode is 9, appears twice, others appear once. So, unique mode. Perfect.

So, this list works.

So, the elements are 5,7,9,9. Now, the sum of squares is 5² + 7² + 9² +9² =25 +49 +81 +81.

Let me compute that: 25+49=74, 81+81=162. 74+162=236.

So, the sum of squares is 236.

But wait, is this the only possible list? Let me think.

Wait, in n=4, c=2, the other two numbers could be other pairs that sum to 12. For example, 4 and 8. So, list [4,8,9,9]. Let's check.

Sorted: [4,8,9,9].

Median: (8+9)/2=8.5, which is not an integer. So, that's invalid because the median must be an integer.

Another pair: 3 and9, but 9 is already in the list. So, the other two numbers can't include 9 because 9 is already the mode. Wait, no, the other two numbers can include 9, but then 9 would appear more times.

Wait, no, in this case, c=2, so the other two numbers can't include 9 because that would make 9 appear 3 times, which is allowed, but then the mode would still be 9.

Wait, let's try [3,9,9,9]. But that's c=3, which we saw earlier doesn't work because the median is 9.

Alternatively, [2,10,9,9]. Sum is 2+10+9+9=30. Sorted: [2,9,9,10]. Median is (9+9)/2=9, which is in the list. So, no good.

Another pair: [1,11,9,9]. Sum is 1+11+9+9=30. Sorted: [1,9,9,11]. Median is (9+9)/2=9, which is in the list. No good.

Another pair: [6,6,9,9]. Sum is 6+6+9+9=30. Sorted: [6,6,9,9]. Median is (6+9)/2=7.5, which is not integer. So, invalid.

Another pair: [2,10,9,9]. As above, which gives median 9, which is in the list.

Another pair: [5,7,9,9], which we saw works.

Another pair: [4,8,9,9]. Median is 8.5, not integer.

So, only [5,7,9,9] works for n=4.

Alternatively, other pairs that sum to 12 and are both even or both odd, so their average is integer.

Wait, 12 can be split into 1 and 11, but that gives median 9, which is in the list.

3 and9: same problem.

5 and7: works.

So, only 5 and7.

Alternatively, 7 and5. Same thing.

So, the list is unique in this case.

So, the sum of squares is 25 +49 +81 +81= 236.

Wait, but is there another possible list with n=4?

Wait, what about [4,8,9,9]. But as above, median is 7.5, which is not integer. So, no.

So, the only possible list is [5,7,9,9].

Wait, but let me check another possible n. Maybe n=5.

Wait, n=5 is odd, so median is the 3rd element, which is in the list. So, that's no good.

n=6, but as we saw earlier, it's tricky because either the mode isn't unique or the median is in the list.

Wait, for n=6, maybe 9 appears 4 times. But 4*9=36>30. So, no.

Alternatively, 9 appears 3 times, others appear 2 times.

Wait, n=6, sum=30.

3 9s: 27. Remaining 3 elements: sum=3. So, 3 1s.

But then, 1 appears 3 times, same as 9. So, bimodal. Doesn't work.

Alternatively, two 1s and one 1, but that's same as above.

Alternatively, can we have other numbers that aren't 1?

Wait, 3 elements summing to 3. So, 1,1,1.

So, that's the only possibility. So, n=6 is stuck.

So, going back, the only possible list that meets all conditions is n=4, with elements 5,7,9,9.

So, the sum of squares is 5² +7² +2*(9²)=25+49+162=236.

But wait, let me double-check. 5² is 25, 7² is 49, 9² is 81, so two 9s: 81*2=162. 25+49=74, 74+162=236.

Yes.

So, the answer is 236.


The list of positive integers must satisfy three conditions: the sum is 30, the unique mode is 9, and the median is a positive integer not in the list. 

To meet these conditions, the list must have an even number of elements so that the median is the average of two middle numbers, which can be an integer not in the list. After testing various possibilities, the list `[5, 7, 9, 9]` satisfies all conditions. The sum of its elements is 30, the mode is 9 (appearing twice), and the median is `(7 + 9) / 2 = 8`, which is not in the list.

The sum of the squares of the elements is calculated as follows:
\[
5^2 + 7^2 + 9^2 + 9^2 = 25 + 49 + 81 + 81 = 236
\]

**Answer:** \boxed{236}
