Okay, so I have this probability problem here about Jen entering a lottery. Let me try to understand it step by step.

So, Jen picks 4 distinct numbers from the set S which is {1,2,3,...,10}. Then, 4 numbers are randomly chosen from S. She wins a prize if at least two of her numbers are among the four chosen. She wins the grand prize if all four of her numbers are chosen. The question is about the probability of her winning the grand prize given that she won a prize. They mention this probability is m/n where m and n are coprime, and we need to find m + n.

Alright, so this is a conditional probability problem. The formula for conditional probability is P(A|B) = P(A ∩ B) / P(B), where A is the event of winning the grand prize, and B is the event of winning a prize.

But in this case, if she wins the grand prize, she must also have won a prize, since winning the grand prize means all four numbers are chosen, which certainly means at least two are chosen. So, A is a subset of B. Therefore, P(A ∩ B) is just P(A). So, the conditional probability P(A|B) is P(A)/P(B).

So, I need to compute P(A) and P(B), then divide them.

First, let's figure out the total number of possible ways the lottery can choose 4 numbers from S. Since S has 10 numbers, the number of possible combinations is C(10,4). Let me compute that: C(10,4) is 10! / (4! * (10-4)!) = (10*9*8*7)/(4*3*2*1) = 210.

So, the total number of possible outcomes is 210.

Now, let's compute P(A), the probability that Jen wins the grand prize. For her to win the grand prize, all four of her numbers must be chosen. Since Jen has picked 4 distinct numbers, the number of favorable outcomes is only 1, because the lottery has to pick exactly her four numbers.

Wait, but hold on. Wait, no. The number of favorable outcomes for the grand prize is 1, because there's only one specific combination that matches all four of her numbers. So, P(A) is 1/210.

Wait, no, that's not right. Wait, no, actually, the number of ways the lottery can choose 4 numbers is C(10,4) = 210. So, the probability that the lottery picks exactly her 4 numbers is 1/C(10,4) = 1/210. So, yes, that's correct.

Now, let's compute P(B), the probability that Jen wins a prize, which is when at least two of her numbers are chosen. So, we need the probability that exactly 2, 3, or 4 of her numbers are among the chosen 4.

Alternatively, it might be easier to compute the probability of the complementary event and subtract it from 1. The complementary event is that fewer than two of her numbers are chosen, i.e., either 0 or 1 of her numbers are chosen.

So, P(B) = 1 - [P(0 of her numbers are chosen) + P(1 of her numbers is chosen)].

Let me compute that.

First, the total number of ways the lottery can pick 4 numbers is 210, as before.

The number of ways to pick 0 of her numbers: that means picking all 4 numbers from the remaining 6 numbers (since S has 10, and Jen has picked 4, the other 6 are not hers). So, the number of such combinations is C(6,4).

Similarly, the number of ways to pick exactly 1 of her numbers: we pick 1 from her 4 numbers and 3 from the remaining 6. So, that's C(4,1)*C(6,3).

So, let's compute these:

C(6,4) is 15.

C(4,1) is 4, and C(6,3) is 20. So, 4 * 20 = 80.

So, the number of ways for 0 or 1 of her numbers being chosen is 15 + 80 = 95.

Therefore, the number of ways for at least two of her numbers being chosen is total combinations minus 95, which is 210 - 95 = 115.

Therefore, P(B) is 115 / 210.

But let me check that: 1 - (95/210) = 115/210. Simplifying that fraction, both numerator and denominator are divisible by 5: 115 ÷5 =23, 210 ÷5=42. So, 23/42. So, P(B) = 23/42.

Wait, let me recast that:

Number of ways for at least two numbers chosen: 115.

So, P(B) = 115 / 210 = 23/4
