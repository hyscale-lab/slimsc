Okay, so I've got this problem here. It says: Let ω ≠ 1 be a 13th root of unity. I need to find the remainder when the product from k=0 to 12 of (2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k}) is divided by 1000. Hmm, okay. Let me try to unpack this step by step.

First, I remember that roots of unity are complex numbers that satisfy ω^n = 1. Since ω is a 13th root of unity, it means that ω^13 = 1, and ω ≠ 1. So ω is a primitive 13th root of unity. That probably means that the minimal polynomial for ω is the 13th cyclotomic polynomial, which is Φ₁₃(x) = x¹² + x¹¹ + ... + x + 1. Not sure if that's directly useful yet, but maybe.

The problem is asking for the product of terms like (2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k}) for k from 0 to 12. So that's 13 terms multiplied together. Since ω^k are all the 13th roots of unity except 1, and when k=0, ω^0 = 1, which is excluded since ω ≠ 1. Wait, no, actually, the problem says ω ≠ 1, but the product is over all k=0 to 12, which includes ω^0 = 1. Hmm, so does that mean that in the product, when k=0, the term is (2 - 2*1 + 1²) = (2 - 2 +1) = 1? So that term is 1, and the rest are for k=1 to 12.

But the product is over k=0 to 12, so including k=0. So the first term is 1, and then we have 12 more terms. But if ω is a primitive 13th root, then ω^k for k=1 to 12 are all the roots except 1.

Now, the expression inside the product is 2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k}. Let me write that as 2(1 - ω^k) + ω^{2k}. Alternatively, perhaps factor it differently.

Wait, maybe I can factor the expression: 2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k}. Let me rearrange it: ω^{2k} - 2ω^k + 2. Hmm, that's a quadratic in ω^k. Let me think of it as x² - 2x + 2, where x = ω^k.

So, for each k, the term is x² - 2x + 2, where x is a 13th root of unity (since ω^k is a 13th root). So the product is the product over all 13th roots x of (x² - 2x + 2). Hmm, that might relate to polynomials.

Wait, I remember that the product over all roots x of a polynomial f(x) evaluated at (x - a) would be f(a), but here it's a bit different. Wait, actually, if I have a polynomial P(x) whose roots are all the ω^k for k=0 to 12, then P(x) = x¹³ - 1, since the roots are the 13th roots of unity.

But wait, the product I'm looking for is the product of (x² - 2x + 2) evaluated at each x = ω^k. So that's the product over roots x of P(x) of (x² - 2x + 2). There's a theorem about that, right? The product over roots of a polynomial P of another polynomial Q evaluated at each root is equal to the resultant or something else?

Alternatively, I recall that if
