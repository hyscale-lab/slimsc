Okay, so I've got this problem here where I need to find the number of triples of nonnegative integers (a, b, c) that satisfy two conditions: a + b + c = 300 and a²b + a²c + b²a + b²c + c²a + c²b = 6,000,000. Hmm, that's a bit intimidating at first glance, but let's try to break it down step by step.

First, I know that a, b, and c are nonnegative integers, so they can be zero or any positive integer. The first equation is straightforward: the sum of the three variables is 300. That's manageable. The second equation looks more complicated, but maybe I can factor it or find a way to relate it to the first equation.

Looking at the second equation: a²b + a²c + b²a + b²c + c²a + c²b. Hmm, I notice that each term is a product of one squared variable and another variable. Maybe I can factor this expression somehow. Let me try to factor it.

Wait, perhaps I can factor by grouping. Let's see:

a²b + a²c = a²(b + c)
Similarly, b²a + b²c = b²(a + c)
And c²a + c²b = c²(a + b)

So the entire expression becomes:
a²(b + c) + b²(a + c) + c²(a + b)

That simplifies it a bit. Now, since a + b + c = 300, we can express (b + c) as (300 - a), (a + c) as (300 - b), and (a + b) as (300 - c). Let me substitute these into the equation.

So now, the second equation becomes:
a²(300 - a) + b²(300 - b) + c²(300 - c) = 6,000,000

Hmm, that looks a bit more manageable. Let me write that out:

300a² - a³ + 300b² - b³ + 300c² - c³ = 6,000,000

I can factor out the 300:

300(a² + b² + c²) - (a³ + b³ + c³) = 6,000,000

Then, dividing both sides by 300 (since 300 isn't zero), I get:

(a² + b² + c²) - (a³ + b³ + c³)/300 = 20,000

Wait, no. Let me correct that. When I factor out 300, it's 300*(a² + b² + c²) minus (a³ + b³ + c³) equals 6,000,000. So, dividing both sides by 300:

(a² + b² + c²) - (a³ + b³ + c³)/300 = 20,000

Hmm, not sure if that helps. Maybe I should think about another approach.

Let me think: I know that a + b + c = 300. Let's denote S = a + b + c = 300. Maybe I can express a² + b² + c² in terms of S and the sum of the products.

Wait, I remember that (a + b + c)^2 = a² + b² + c² + 2(ab + bc + ac). So, from this, I can write a² + b² + c² = S² - 2(ab + bc + ac). Since S is 300, this would be 300² - 2(ab + bc + ac) = 90,000 - 2(ab + bc + ac).

So, a² + b² + c² = 90,000 - 2(ab + bc + ac). Let me denote P = ab + bc + ac, so a² + b² + c² = 90,000 - 2P.

Now, going back to the modified second equation:

300(a² + b² + c²) - (a³ + b³ + c³) = 6,000,000

Substituting a² + b² + c² as 90,000 - 2P:

300*(90,000 - 2P) - (a³ + b³ + c³) = 6,000,000

Calculating 300*90,000: 300*90,000 = 27,000,000

300*(-2P) = -600P

So, the equation becomes:

27,000,000 - 600P - (a³ + b³ + c³) = 6,000,000

Let me rearrange this:

-600P - (a³ + b³ + c³) = 6,000,000 - 27,000,000
-600P - (a³ + b³ + c³) = -21,000,000

Multiply both sides by (-1):

600P + (a³ + b³ + c³) = 21,000,000

Hmm, okay, so now I have 600P + (a³ + b³ + c³) = 21,000,000.

I wonder if I can express a³ + b³ + c³ in terms of S, P, and Q, where Q is abc. Because I recall the identity:

a³ + b³ + c³ = (a + b + c)^3 - 3(a + b + c)(ab + bc + ac) + 3abc

So, that's S³ - 3 S P + 3 Q.

Given that S = 300, P is ab + bc + ac, and Q is abc.

So, substituting into a³ + b³ + c³:

300³ - 3*300*P + 3 Q =
