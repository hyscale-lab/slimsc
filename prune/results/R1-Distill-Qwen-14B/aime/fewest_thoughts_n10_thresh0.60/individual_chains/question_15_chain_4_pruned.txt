Okay, so I have this math problem here about counting the number of paths on an 8x8 grid. The paths are of length 16, meaning they go from the lower left corner to the upper right corner, moving only right or up. But there's a catch: the paths must change direction exactly four times. Hmm, let's see how I can approach this.

First, I remember that in a grid, the number of paths from the lower left to the upper right without any restrictions is given by the binomial coefficient. For an 8x8 grid, you need to make 8 moves right and 8 moves up, so the number of paths is C(16,8), which is 12870. But this problem is more specific.

The key here is that the paths must change direction exactly four times. So, I need to figure out what that means in terms of the path's structure. Changing direction means switching from moving right to up or up to right. So, a path that changes direction exactly four times will have segments where it moves in one direction, then another, and so on, with four switches.

Each time you change direction, you're essentially starting a new "run" of moves in the new direction. So, if there are four direction changes, the path is divided into five segments. For example, the path might start with a few rights, switch to ups, then rights again, and so on, totaling five segments.

Wait, but direction changes can be either right to up or up to right. So, the path alternates between right and up segments. Let me think about how that affects the number of segments. If you start with a right move, then you'll have a right segment, then an up segment, then right, then up, and so on. Similarly, if you start with an up move, it alternates the other way.

So, the number of direction changes being four leads to five segments. Each segment is a consecutive run of right or up moves. Now, since the grid is 8x8, the total number of right moves is 8 and the total number of up moves is 8.

So, the problem reduces to distributing the 8 right moves and 8 up moves into these five segments, with the constraint that the segments alternate between right and up, depending on the starting direction.

But wait, do I know whether the path starts with a right or up move? The problem doesn't specify, so I think I have to consider both cases: starting with a right move and starting with an up move.

So, let's break it down into two scenarios:

1. Paths that start with a right move and change direction four times.
2. Paths that start with an up move and change direction four times.

For each scenario, I can calculate the number of paths and then add them together for the total.

Let's consider the first case: starting with a right move. Since there are four direction changes, the path will have segments: right, up, right, up, right. So, five segments in total, alternating right and up. Wait, no, four direction changes mean five segments, and since it starts with right, the segments will be right, up, right, up, right.

Alternatively, if starting with up, the segments are up, right, up, right, up. So, same number of segments but starting with up.

In both cases, the number of right segments and up segments will be three of one and two of the other. Because starting with right, you have three right segments and two up segments, or starting with up, three up segments and two right segments. Hmm, wait, let me count.

Starting with right: first segment is right, then up, then right, then up, then right. So that's three right segments and two up segments. Similarly, starting with up: three up segments and two right segments.

But wait, the total number of right moves is 8, and up moves is 8. So, in the first case, we have three right segments and two up segments, but each right segment must have at least one move, same with each up segment. Because if a segment has zero moves, that would mean no change in direction, which isn't allowed. But in our problem, we have exactly four direction changes, so each segment must have at least one move.

Therefore, the problem becomes a stars and bars problem where we distribute 8 right moves into 3 segments, each at least 1, and 8 up moves into 2 segments, each at least 1, for the first case (starting with right). Similarly, for the second case, distributing 8 up moves into 3 segments and 8 right into 2 segments.

So, for the first case: starting with right. The number of ways to distribute 8 right moves into 3 segments is C(8-1,3-1) = C(7,2) = 21. Similarly, the number of ways to distribute 8 up moves into 2 segments is C(8-1,2-1) = C(7,1) = 7. So, the total number of paths for this case is 21 * 7 = 147.

Similarly, for the second case: starting with up. The number of ways to distribute 8 up moves into 3 segments is C(7,2) = 21, and distributing 8 right moves into 2 segments is C(7,1) = 7. So, again, 21 *7=147.

Therefore, the total number of paths is 147 + 147 = 294.

Wait, but is that correct? Let me double-check.

Wait, the direction changes can be either right to up or up to right, but in this setup, I'm considering starting with right or up, and each scenario gives 147 paths. So, adding them gives 294. But is there any overlap or something I might have missed?

Wait, another thought: in each case, whether starting with right or up, the number of direction changes is four, so each contributes 147. So, adding them gives 294. Hmm.

Let me think of another approach to verify. Alternatively, the number of direction changes is four. So, the number of runs is five.

But in order to have five runs, the path must alternate between right and up. So, whether it starts with right or up, the number of runs of each direction is either three of one and two of the other.

Wait, another way: the number of paths with exactly k direction changes is equal to 2 * C(n-1, k/2) * C(m-1, k/2) when k is even? Wait, not exactly, perhaps.

Wait, perhaps using generating functions or recursive approaches, but maybe that's complicating.

Wait, another approach: the number of paths with exactly four direction changes is equal to the number of ways to have five runs, either starting with right or up.

For each starting direction, the number of runs is five, with three runs of the starting direction and two runs of the other.

So, for starting with right:

Number of ways to divide 8 right into 3 runs: C(8-1,3-1) = C(7,2)=21.

Number of ways to divide 8 up into 2 runs: C(8-1,2-1)=C(7,1)=7.

Multiply them: 21*7=147.

Similarly, starting with up:

Number of ways to divide 8 up into 3 runs: 21.

Number of ways to divide 8 right into 2 runs:7.

Multiply: 147.

Total is 147*2=294.

Hmm, that seems consistent. So, the answer would be 294.

But wait, just to make sure, let me think of a smaller grid example.

Suppose I have a 2x2 grid. So, from (0,0) to (2,2). The total paths without restrictions are C(4,2)=6.

Now, how many paths change direction exactly two times.

Wait, let's think: starting with right, then up, then right. That's two direction changes.

Or starting with up, then right, then up. That's two direction changes.

So, for each starting direction, how many such paths are there.

Starting with right: we have two right segments and one up segment.

Wait, no: in a 2x2 grid, starting with right, to have two direction changes, the path would be right, up
