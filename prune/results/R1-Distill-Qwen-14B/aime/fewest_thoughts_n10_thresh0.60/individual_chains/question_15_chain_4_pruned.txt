Okay, so I've got this math problem here about counting paths on an 8x8 grid. The paths are of length 16, moving from the lower left corner to the upper right corner. The catch is that these paths must change direction exactly four times. Hmm, okay, let me try to unpack this.

First, I remember that on a grid, moving from one corner to the opposite, you usually move right and up. For an 8x8 grid, that would mean moving 8 steps right and 8 steps up, totaling 16 steps. So each path is a sequence of 8 rights (R) and 8 ups (U), arranged in some order, right? But wait, the question is about changing direction exactly four times. So that must mean that the path alternates between moving right and up multiple times, but only four times in total.

Wait, let me clarify: changing direction. So if you're moving right and then switch to up, that's a direction change. Similarly, moving up and then switching to right is another direction change. So the number of direction changes is equal to the number of times you switch from R to U or U to R. 

If the path changes direction exactly four times, that means the number of runs or segments of consecutive R's or U's is five. Because each change adds a new segment. So for example, starting with R, then changing to U, that's two segments, one change. So four changes would mean five segments in total.

But wait, the starting direction can be either R or U. So there are two cases: starting with R or starting
