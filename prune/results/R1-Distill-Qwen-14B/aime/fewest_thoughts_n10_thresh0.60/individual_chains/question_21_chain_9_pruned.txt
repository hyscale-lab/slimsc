Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the least integer base b (where b is at least 2) such that there are more than ten b-eautiful integers. Hmm, let me try to understand what b-eautiful means.

From the problem statement, a positive integer n is called b-eautiful if two conditions are met:
1. When n is expressed in base b, it has exactly two digits. That means n is of the form a*base + c, where a and c are digits in base b. So, in base 10, two-digit numbers are from 10 to 99, but in base b, two-digit numbers would range from b to b^2 - 1. So n must satisfy b ≤ n ≤ b² - 1.
2. The sum of these two digits equals the square root of n. So if the digits are a and c, then a + c = sqrt(n).

Let me write this down more formally. If n is written as a two-digit number in base b, then n = a*b + c, where a and c are digits in base b. Therefore, a can range from 1 to b-1 (since it's the leading digit and can't be zero), and c can range from 0 to b-1.

The second condition is that a + c = sqrt(n). Since sqrt(n) must be an integer because a and c are integers. So n must be a perfect square. Therefore, n = k², where k is a positive integer. So combining both conditions:
- n = a*b + c = k²
- a + c = k

So, substituting the second equation into the first, we get:
k² = a*b + c
But since c = k - a, substitute that in:
k² = a*b + (k - a)
Simplify:
k² = a*b + k - a
k² = a*(b - 1) + k

Let me rearrange this equation:
k² - k = a*(b - 1)
So, a = (k² - k)/(b - 1)

Since a has to be a positive integer and a digit in base b, it must satisfy 1 ≤ a ≤ b - 1.

Similarly, c = k - a must also be a digit in base b, so 0 ≤ c ≤ b - 1. Therefore, k - a must be between 0 and b - 1.

Let me think about how to approach this. For a given base b, I need to find how many k's satisfy these conditions. Each valid k will correspond to a unique a and c, and thus a unique n which is b-eautiful.

So, for each base b, I can iterate over possible k's and see if (k² - k) is divisible by (b - 1), and then check if a and c are valid digits.

But since I need to find the smallest b where the number of such n's exceeds ten, I probably need a systematic way to count the number of valid k's for each b.

Let me think about the constraints on k. Since n is a two-digit number in base b, n must be between b and b² - 1. But n is also k², so k² must be between b and b² - 1.

So, sqrt(b) ≤ k ≤ sqrt(b² - 1). That is, k is between floor(sqrt(b)) + 1 and b - 1? Wait, let me check. For example, in base 10, n must be between 10 and 99, so k is between 4 (since 4²=16) and 9 (since 9²=81 is less than 99, but 10² is 100 which is beyond). Wait, but actually, in base b, n can go up to b² - 1, so k can go up to sqrt(b² - 1). Since b is at least 2, sqrt(b² - 1) is less than b, so k can be up to b - 1.

Wait, actually, for example, in base 13, n is 81, which is 6*13 + 3 = 81. So k is 9 because 9² = 81. So for base 13, k can be up to 9, which is less than 13.

So, the range for
