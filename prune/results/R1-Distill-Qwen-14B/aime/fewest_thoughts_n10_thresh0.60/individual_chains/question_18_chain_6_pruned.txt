Okay, so I've got this problem about counting the number of rectangles that can be formed inside a regular dodecagon. A dodecagon has 12 sides, so it's a 12-sided polygon. The rectangles are such that each side lies on either a side or a diagonal of the dodecagon. Hmm, interesting.

First off, I remember that in regular polygons, especially those with an even number of sides, there are certain symmetries that can help in counting such shapes. Rectangles would require four points where each pair of opposite sides are equal and parallel, and the angles are all right angles. But wait, in a regular dodecagon, the sides are all the same length, but the diagonals can vary in length depending on how many vertices they skip.

So, maybe I should start by visualizing a regular dodecagon. It has 12 vertices equally spaced around a circle. Each vertex is connected by sides of the dodecagon, or diagonals. Since the dodecagon is regular, all the sides and angles are equal, which should help in terms of symmetry and counting.

Now, the question is about rectangles. So, what defines a rectangle here? In a regular polygon, a rectangle is formed by four vertices where the sides are either sides of the polygon or diagonals, and the opposite sides are equal and parallel, and the angles between adjacent sides are right angles (90 degrees). But wait, in a regular dodecagon, the internal angles are 150 degrees each. So, I'm a bit confused here because if the polygon's internal angles are 150 degrees, how can the rectangles have 90-degree angles?

Ah, wait a second. The sides of the rectangle lie on the sides or diagonals of the dodecagon, but the rectangle itself doesn't have to be aligned with the sides of the dodecagon. So, the vertices of the rectangle are just four points of the dodecagon, connected in such a way that the sides of the rectangle are either sides or diagonals of the dodecagon, forming a rectangle. So, the rectangle's sides don't necessarily have to be sides of the dodecagon, but they can be any of the sides or diagonals.

Wait, actually, no. The problem says each side of the rectangle lies on either a side or a diagonal of the dodecagon. So, each edge of the rectangle is an edge (side) or a diagonal of the dodecagon. That means the edges of the rectangle must be one of the lines connecting two vertices of the dodecagon.

So, for the rectangle to be formed, the four sides must each be such lines. So, the rectangle is determined by four points in the dodecagon where each consecutive pair is connected by a side or diagonal, and the opposite sides are equal and parallel, forming a rectangle.

Hmm, but how do I ensure that the opposite sides are equal and parallel? Because in a regular polygon, the sides and diagonals have different lengths. So, the sides of the rectangle must each be either
