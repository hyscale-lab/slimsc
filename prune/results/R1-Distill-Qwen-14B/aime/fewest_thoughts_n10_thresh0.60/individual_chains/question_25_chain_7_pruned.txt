Okay, so I'm trying to solve this problem about residents in Aimeville and the things they own. Hmm, let me read it again carefully.

There are 900 residents total. Out of these, 195 own a diamond ring, 367 own a set of golf clubs, 562 own a garden spade. And everyone owns a bag of candy hearts. So, every resident has at least the candy hearts. Then, it says that 437 residents own exactly two of these things, and 234 own exactly three. I need to find how many own all four.

Wait, so each resident owns at least the candy hearts. That means the candy hearts are kind of a given for everyone. So, when it talks about owning other items, I guess it's in addition to the candy hearts. Hmm, maybe I should think of the candy hearts as a separate set, or maybe it's included in the other ownership counts.

Let me break it down. Let me denote the sets as follows:

- Let C be the set of residents who own a candy heart. Since every resident owns one, |C| = 900.

- Let D be the set of those who own a diamond ring. So, |D| = 195.

- Let G be the set of those with a golf club. |G| = 367.

- Let S be the set of those with a garden spade. |S| = 562.

We need to find the number of residents who own all four items, which is |D ∩ G ∩ S ∩ C|. But since C is everyone, it's the same as |D ∩ G ∩ S|.

We also know that 437 own exactly two of these things, and 234 own exactly three. So, these are counts of residents in exactly two and exactly three of the sets D, G, S, and C. Wait, but C is everyone, so does that affect how we count?

Hmm, maybe I should model this using the principle of inclusion-exclusion. Let me recall the formula for four sets:

|D ∪ G ∪ S ∪ C| = |D| + |G| + |S| + |C| - |D∩G| - |D∩S| - |D∩C| - |G∩S| - |G∩C| - |S∩C| + |D∩G∩S| + |D∩G∩C| + |D∩S∩C| + |G∩S∩C| - |D∩G∩S∩C|.

But wait, since everyone is in C, the union |D ∪ G ∪ S ∪ C| is actually just C, which is 900. Because every resident is in C already, so the union is just 900. So,

900 = |D| + |G| + |S| + |C| - |D∩G| - |D∩S| - |D∩C| - |G∩S| - |G∩C| - |S∩C| + |D∩G∩S| + |D∩G∩C| + |D∩S∩C| + |
