Okay, so I'm trying to solve this geometry problem about a torus and a sphere. Let me read it again and try to break it down.

The torus T is created by revolving a circle with radius 3 around an axis in the plane of the circle, and this axis is 6 units away from the center of the circle. So, that's like a donut shape. The sphere S has a radius of 11. 

When T rests on the inside of S, it's internally tangent along a circle with radius r_i. When it's on the outside, it's externally tangent along a circle with radius r_o. I need to find the difference r_i - r_o and express it as a reduced fraction m/n, then find m + n.

Hmm. Okay, so I think I need to figure out what the radii of these circles of tangency are when the torus is inside and outside the sphere.

First, let me recall some properties of a torus. A torus can be thought of as a surface of revolution generated by rotating a circle around an external axis. The torus has two important radii: the major radius R, which is the distance from the center of the generating circle to the axis of revolution, and the minor radius r, which is the radius of the generating circle itself.

In this problem, the generating circle has a radius of 3, so the minor radius r = 3. The major radius R is the distance from the center of the generating circle to the axis of revolution. The problem states that the axis is 6 units away from the center of the generating circle, so R = 6.

Therefore, the torus T has major radius R = 6 and minor radius r = 3.

Now, the sphere S has radius 11. So, when the torus is inside the sphere and tangent, the distance between their centers must be equal to the sphere's radius minus the torus's major radius, but wait, is that correct?

Wait, actually, when two surfaces are tangent internally, the distance between their centers is equal to the difference of their radii. Similarly, when they are externally tangent, the distance is equal to the sum of their radii.

But wait, in this case, the torus is a more complex shape than a sphere. So, I can't directly apply that logic because the torus isn't a sphere. Hmm, maybe I need to think about the maximum and minimum distances from the sphere's center to the torus.

Wait, another thought: the torus can be considered as a surface where every point is at a distance of 3 from a circle of radius 6. So, the torus is like a ring where each point is 3 units away from some central circle with radius 6.

So, the sphere S has radius 11. When the torus is inside S and tangent, the closest point on the torus to the center of S must be just touching the sphere. Similarly, when it's outside, the farthest point on the torus must be touching the sphere.

Wait, perhaps I should model the torus as a surface in 3D space. Let me consider the coordinate system where the axis of the tor
