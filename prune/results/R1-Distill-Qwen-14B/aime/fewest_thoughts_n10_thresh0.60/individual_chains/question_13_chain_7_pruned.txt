Okay, so I've got this math problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again and make sure I understand what's being asked.

Every morning, Aya goes for a 9-kilometer-long walk and stops at a coffee shop afterwards. When she walks at a constant speed of 's' kilometers per hour, the walk takes her 4 hours, including 't' minutes spent in the coffee shop. When she walks 's + 2' kilometers per hour, the walk takes her 2 hours and 24 minutes, including 't' minutes. Now, they're asking me to find the number of minutes the walk takes her when she walks at 's + 1/2' kilometers per hour, including the 't' minutes again.

Hmm, okay. So the key here is that the total time includes both the walking time and the coffee shop time 't'. So, for each speed, the total time is the time she spends walking plus 't' minutes.

Wait, but in the problem, when she walks at 's' km/h, the total time is 4 hours, which includes 't' minutes. Similarly, when she walks at 's + 2' km/h, the total time is 2 hours and 24 minutes, which again includes 't' minutes. So, I can set up equations based on these two scenarios.

Let me think about how to model this. The total time for each walk is equal to the walking time plus the coffee stop time. So, for the first scenario:

Total time (when speed is s) = Walking time + t
Which is 4 hours = (9 km / s km/h) + t

But wait, 't' is given in minutes. The problem says 4 hours including t minutes. So, I need to convert everything into the same units. It might be easier to convert everything into minutes. Let me try that.

So, 4 hours is 4 * 60 = 240 minutes. Similarly, t is in minutes, and the walking time would be in minutes as well. So, the first equation becomes:

240 = (9 / s) * 60 + t

Because time in hours multiplied by 60 to get minutes. So, (9 / s) hours is equal to (9 / s) * 60 minutes.

Similarly, for the second scenario,
