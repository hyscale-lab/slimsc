Okay, so I have this geometry problem here. Let me try to understand it step by step.

We have triangle ABC inscribed in a circle ω. That means ω is the circumcircle of triangle ABC. The tangents to ω at points B and C intersect at point D. Then, the line AD intersects ω again at point P. We're given the lengths of AB, BC, and AC: AB is 5, BC is 9, and AC is 10. We need to find AP, express it as a fraction m/n where m and n are coprime, and then find m + n.

First, I should probably draw a diagram to visualize this. Since Asymptote code is provided, maybe I can get some idea from it, but I think I can manage without it by just sketching it mentally.

So, triangle ABC with AB=5, BC=9, AC=10. Let me note down the sides: AB=5, BC=9, AC=10. Hmm, wait, in a triangle, the sides must satisfy the triangle inequality. Let me check: AB + BC = 5 + 9 =14 > 10=AC. Similarly, AB + AC=15>9, and BC + AC=19>5. So, it's a valid triangle.

Now, the tangents at B and C meet at D. So, D is the ex-pole or something? Wait, no. The point where two tangents meet is called the ex-pole, but I think more accurately, it's called the exsimilicenter or something like that? Or maybe the external homothety center. Hmm, perhaps. But I might be overcomplicating.

I remember that if two tangents are drawn from a common external point to a circle, their lengths are equal. So, DB = DC because both are tangents from D to ω. So, D lies on the symmetry axis of BC, meaning that BD = CD.

Wait, but since ABC is inscribed in ω, and D is the intersection of the tangents at B and C, perhaps D is the exsimilicenter of some sort. Alternatively, perhaps using properties of harmonic division or pole-polar concepts.

Alternatively, maybe using power of a point. Since D is the intersection of two tangents,
