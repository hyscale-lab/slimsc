Okay, so I have this geometry problem here. Let me try to parse it step by step.

We have three points: O at (0,0), A at (1/2, 0), and B at (0, sqrt(3)/2). So, O is the origin, A is halfway along the x-axis between O and (1,0), and B is a point on the y-axis such that its y-coordinate is sqrt(3)/2, which is approximately 0.866. So, O is the origin, A is halfway to (1,0), and B is a bit more than three-quarters of the way to (0,1) on the y-axis.

Then, the family F consists of segments PQ of unit length lying in the first quadrant, with P on the x-axis and Q on the y-axis. So, each segment PQ is of length 1, starts on the x-axis at some point P, and ends on the y-axis at some point Q, both in the first quadrant.

Now, the problem states that there's a unique point C on segment AB, different from A and B, that doesn't belong to any other segment from F except AB. So, AB is one of these PQ segments, and C is a point on AB that isn't on any other PQ from the family F.

We need to find OC^2, which is the square of the distance from the origin to point C, and express it as a reduced fraction p/q, then find p + q.

First, let's find the equation of line AB because point C is on AB. So, let's get the coordinates of A and B:

A is at (1/2, 0), and B is at (0, sqrt(3)/2). Let's find the equation of the line AB.

The slope of AB would be (y2 - y1)/(x2 - x1) = (sqrt(3)/2 - 0)/(0 - 1/2) = (sqrt(3)/2)/(-1/2) = -sqrt(3).

So, the slope is -sqrt(3). Using point-slope form, let's write the equation of AB. Let's use point A (1/2, 0):

y - 0 = -sqrt(3)(x - 1/2)
y = -sqrt(3)x + (sqrt(3)/2)

So, equation of AB is y = -sqrt(3)x + sqrt(3)/2.

Now, point C lies somewhere on this line, so its coordinates can be represented as (x, -sqrt(3)x + sqrt(3)/2) for some x between 0 and 1/2 because AB goes from (1/2,0) to (0, sqrt(3)/2).

Now, the key part is that C is on AB and doesn't lie on any other segment PQ from family F except AB. So, for any other PQ in F, C shouldn't be on PQ. So, we need to find such a point C.

I think the approach is to find the envelope of all these PQ segments. The envelope is a curve that is tangent to each member of a family of curves. Since all PQ segments are lines of length 1 from the x-axis to y-axis, their envelope might form some curve, perhaps a parabola or something else. The point C is where AB is tangent to this envelope, meaning that C is the point of tangency, and hence, it's the only point on AB that doesn't lie on any other PQ from F.

So, to find the envelope of the family F, we can parameterize the segments PQ.

Let me parameterize each segment PQ. Let's let P be a point (t, 0) on the x-axis and Q be a point (0, s) on the y-axis. Since PQ is a segment of length 1, the distance between P and Q must be 1.

Therefore, the distance formula gives sqrt((t)^2 + (s)^2) = 1, so t^2 + s^2 = 1.

But since the segment is in the first quadrant, t and s are positive. So, t and s satisfy t^2 + s^2 = 1.

The equation of the line PQ can be parametrized. Let's find the equation of PQ for given t and s.

The line PQ connects (t, 0) to (0, s). Its slope is (s - 0)/(0 - t) = -s/t.

So, the equation is y = (-s/t)x + s.

Alternatively, since t^2 + s^2 = 1, we can express s in terms of t or vice versa.

Let me express s as sqrt(1 - t^2) because s = sqrt(1 - t^2) since t and s are positive.

So, substituting s into the equation of PQ, we get:

y = (-sqrt(1 - t^2)/t)x + sqrt(1 - t^2)

We can write this as:

y = (-sqrt(1 - t^2)/t)x + sqrt(1 - t^2)

Alternatively, let's let t vary from 0 to 1, and each t gives a unique PQ segment.

To find the envelope, we can use the method of differentiation with respect to the parameter t.

The envelope of a family of curves given by F(x, y, t) = 0 satisfies both F(x, y, t) = 0 and dF/dt = 0.

So, let's write the equation of PQ as F(x, y, t) = y + (sqrt(1 - t^2)/t)x - sqrt(1 - t^2) = 0.

Wait, that might not be the best approach. Alternatively, let's write the equation of PQ as:

x/t + y/s = 1, but since t^2 + s^2 = 1, s = sqrt(1 - t^2). So, the equation becomes x/t + y/sqrt(1 - t^2) = 1.

Yes, that's another way to write the equation of PQ.

So,
