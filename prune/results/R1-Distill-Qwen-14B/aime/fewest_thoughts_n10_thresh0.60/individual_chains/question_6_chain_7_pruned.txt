Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the number of intersections between two graphs. The equations are given as:

1. \( y = 4 g(f(\sin (2 \pi x))) \)
2. \( x = 4 g(f(\cos (3 \pi y))) \)

And the functions f and g are defined as:
- \( f(x) = ||x| - 1/2| \)
- \( g(x) = ||x| - 1/4| \)

Hmm, this seems a bit complicated, but I'll try to break it down step by step.

First, let me understand what f(x) and g(x) look like. They are both absolute value functions, so their graphs will have V-shapes.

Starting with f(x) = ||x| - 1/2|.

Let me think about the inner part first: |x|. That's a V-shape with the vertex at (0,0). Then subtracting 1/2: |x| - 1/2. So, that shifts the graph down by 1/2. Now, the vertex would be at (0, -1/2). But since we take the absolute value again, any negative parts will flip up.

So, when is |x| - 1/2 negative? That happens when |x| < 1/2. So, for x between -1/2 and 1/2, |x| - 1/2 is negative, and taking the absolute value of that will make it positive.

So, f(x) will have a V-shape that's W-shaped overall. Let me plot some points.

At x=0: |0| -1/2 = -1/2; absolute value is 1/2. So f(0) = 1/2.

At x=1/2: |1/2| -1/2 = 0; absolute value is 0. So f(1/2)=0.

At x=1: |1| -1/2 = 1/2; absolute is 1/2. So f(1)=1/2.

Similarly, for negative x, it's symmetric. So f(x) is a W-shaped graph with minima at x=±1/2 and x=0, with the minima at (1/2, 0) and (-1/2, 0), and peaks at (0, 1/2).

Similarly, for g(x) = ||x| - 1/4|.

Again, let's break it down. The inner function is |x|, then subtract 1/4. So, |x| -1/4.

When is this negative? When |x| < 1/4. So, for x between -1/4 and 1/4, |x| -1/4 is negative, and taking absolute value will flip it.

So, g(x) will also have a V-shape but with a W-like graph. Let's plot some points.

At x=0: |0| -1/4 = -1/4; absolute value is 1/4. So g(0)=1/4.

At x=1/4: |1/4| -1/4 = 0; absolute is 0. So g(1/4)=0.

At x=1/2: |1/2| -1/4 = 1/4; absolute is 1/4. So g(1/2)=1/4.

Same for negative x. So g(x) is W-shaped with minima at x=±1/4 and x=0, with minima at (1/4, 0) and (-1/4, 0), and peaks at (0, 1/4).

Okay, now I have f and g. Now, let's move to the functions inside the equations.

First equation: \( y = 4 g(f(\sin (2 \pi x))) \)

Second equation: \( x = 4 g(f(\cos (3 \pi y))) \)

So, both equations involve nesting f and g functions on trigonometric functions, and then scaling by 4.

I think it's helpful to analyze the range and possible outputs of these functions.

Let me first look at the inner functions.

For the first equation, inside g, we have f(sin(2πx)).

Similarly, for the second equation, inside g, we have f(cos(3πy)).

Let me find the range of f(sin(2πx)) and f(cos(3πy)).

First, sin(2πx) has a range of [-1, 1]. Similarly, cos(3πy) also has a range of [-1,1].

So, let's consider f(z), where z is between -1 and 1.

f(z) = ||z| - 1/2|. So, let's see what's the range of f(z) for z in [-1,1].

We can think about the possible values of |z|, which is [0,1].

Then, |z| - 1/2: this would be in [-1/2, 1/2].

Taking the absolute value of that, the range is [0, 1/2].

Wait, because if |z| - 1/2 can be negative, but then we take absolute value, so the range is [0, 1/2].

So f(z) ∈ [0, 1/2].

Similarly, then g takes this as input. So g(w), where w ∈ [0, 1/2].

g(w) = ||w| - 1/4|. Since w is non-negative, this becomes |w - 1/4|.

Because w is between 0 and 1/2, let's see what g(w) is.

g(w) = |w - 1/4|.

So, when w is less than 1/4, this is 1/4 - w.

When w is equal to 1/4, it's 0.

When w is greater than 1/4, it's w - 1/4.

So, since w ranges from 0 to 1/2, let's see the range of g(w).

At w=0: g(0)=1/4.

At w=1/4: g(1/4)=0.

At w=1/2: g(1/2)=1/2 - 1/4 = 1/4.

So g(w) ∈ [0, 1/4].

Therefore, 4*g(w) ∈ [0, 1].

So, the first equation, y = 4 g(f(sin(2πx))), will have y ∈ [0,1].

Similarly, the second equation, x = 4 g(f(cos(3πy))), will have x ∈ [0,1].

So, both x and y are in [0,1], because their definitions involve 4*g(f(...)), which maps to [0,1].

Wait, but wait a second. Let me double-check.

Wait, f(z) is in [0, 1/2], as we saw. Then g(w) for w in [0,1/2] is in [0,1/4], correct? So 4*g(w) is [0,1]. So, yes, y and x are in [0,1].

So, the graphs of these equations will lie within the square [0,1] × [0,1].

Now, to find the number of intersections, we can consider the system of equations:

y = 4 g(f(sin(2πx)))

x = 4 g(f(cos(3πy)))

So, each equation is a function that maps x to y and y to x, respectively.

Wait, but since both are functions, each can be plotted as a curve in the x-y plane. The number of intersections would be the number of points (x,y) that satisfy both equations.

But solving this system might be tricky because of the nested functions. Let me try to see if I can find any symmetries or periodicities that can help.

First, let's consider the periodicity of the trigonometric functions.

In the first equation, we have sin(2πx). The period of sin(2πx) is 1, since sin(2π(x+1)) = sin(2πx + 2π) = sin(2πx).

Similarly, in the second equation, cos(3πy) has a period of 2/3, since cos(3π(y + 2/3)) = cos(3πy + 2π) = cos(3πy).

But since x and y are in [0,1], and the functions are periodic, we can expect the graphs to have multiple oscillations within this interval.

But perhaps instead of trying to plot the entire graph, I can exploit the periodicity and see how many times the functions can intersect.

Alternatively, maybe I can parameterize one variable and substitute into the other equation.

Wait, but since both equations are functions, each x corresponds to a unique y, and each y corresponds to a unique x.

But since they're both functions, maybe each is a curve, and their intersection points can be found by solving them simultaneously.

But that's abstract. Let me think about the structure of these functions.

Let me first consider the first function: y = 4 g(f(sin(2πx))).

Let me analyze the inner functions step by step.

Compute f(sin(2πx)):

We have sin(2πx) ∈ [-1,1], so |sin(2πx)| ∈ [0,1].

f(z) = ||z| - 1/2|.

So, f(sin(2πx)) = || |sin(2πx)| - 1/2 |.

Hmm, that's a bit convoluted, but let's think about it.

Similarly, g(w) = ||w| - 1/4|, so g(f(sin(2πx))) = || || |sin(2πx)| - 1/2 | - 1/4 |.

Wait, maybe it's better to compute f(z) and then g(w) step by step.
