Okay, so I have this problem here about finding the radius of the smallest sphere that can contain any rectangular box with a surface area of 54 and a volume of 23. Then, I need to express r squared as a fraction p/q where p and q are coprime, and find p+q. Hmm, okay.

First, let's get clear on the problem. A rectangular box has length, width, and height. Let's denote them as x, y, z. The surface area of a rectangular box is given by 2(xy + yz + xz) = 54, and the volume is xyz = 23. The goal is to find the minimal sphere that can contain any such box. The sphere's radius would be half the space diagonal of the box, right? Because the sphere has to enclose the box, so the maximum distance from the center of the sphere to any vertex of the box is the radius. The space diagonal is the distance from one corner of the box to the opposite corner, which passes through the center. So, the radius r would be half of that diagonal.

So, the space diagonal of the box is sqrt(x² + y² + z²). Therefore, r = (1/2)*sqrt(x² + y² + z²), and r² = (x² + y² + z²)/4. So, to find r², I need to find the minimum of (x² + y² + z²)/4, given the constraints on surface area and volume.

Wait, no. Wait a minute. Wait, the problem says the smallest sphere that can contain each of the boxes in set B. So, the sphere must contain all such boxes. So, for any box in B, the sphere must contain it. So, the sphere must be large enough that all possible boxes (with surface area 54 and volume 23) are inside it.

Wait, that's a different interpretation. So, it's not that for each box, find its minimal sphere, but rather find a sphere that works for all boxes in B. So, the radius r must be such that for any box x,y,z in B, the sphere of radius r contains it. Then, r would be the maximum possible space diagonal over all boxes in B, divided by 2. Because the sphere needs to contain the box whose space diagonal is the largest.

So, I need to maximize (x² + y² + z²) over all boxes with surface area 54 and volume 23, then take half of that square root for r, and then square it to get r².

So, the problem reduces to maximizing x² + y² + z² given 2(xy + yz + xz) = 54 and xyz = 23.

Hmm, okay. So, I need to maximize x² + y² + z² with those constraints.

I think this is an optimization problem with constraints. Maybe I can use Lagrange multipliers. Let's set up the function to maximize: f(x,y,z) = x² + y² + z².

Subject to the constraints:

g(x,y,z) = 2(xy + yz + xz) - 54 = 0,

h(x,y,z) = xyz - 23 = 0.

So, we can set up the Lagrangian: L = f - λg - μh.

So, L = x² + y² + z² - λ(2xy + 2yz + 2xz - 54) - μ(xyz - 23).

Then, take partial derivatives with respect to x, y, z, set them equal to zero.

Let's compute the partial derivatives.

dL/dx = 2x - λ(2y + 2z) - μ(yz) = 0

dL/dy = 2y - λ(2x + 2z) - μ(xz) = 0

dL/dz = 2z - λ(2x + 2y) - μ(xy) = 0

So, we have the following system of equations:

1) 2x - 2λ(y + z) - μ y z = 0

2) 2y - 2λ(x + z) - μ x z = 0

3) 2z - 2λ(x + y) - μ x y = 0

And the constraints:

4) 2(xy + yz + xz) = 54

5) xyz = 23

Hmm, that's a system of five equations with five variables x, y, z, λ, μ.

This looks a bit complicated, but maybe we can find some symmetry or make some substitutions.

Let me assume that the maximum occurs when x = y = z. Wait, but if x = y = z, then the box is a cube. Let's check if that is possible.

If x = y = z, then the surface area would be 6x² = 54, so x² = 9, x=3. Then the volume would be x³ = 27. But in our case, the volume is 23, which is less than 27. So, the cube is not in our set B. So, x, y, z cannot all be equal. So, the maximum must occur at some other point where x, y, z are not equal.

Alternatively, maybe two variables are equal, and the third
