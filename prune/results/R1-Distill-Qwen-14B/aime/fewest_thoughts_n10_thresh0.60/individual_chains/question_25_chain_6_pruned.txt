Okay, so I've got this math problem here about residents in Aimeville and the things they own. Let me try to wrap my head around it step by step. 

First, the problem says there are 900 residents in total. Each resident owns a bag of candy hearts, which is one thing. Then, there are three other items: diamond rings, golf clubs, and garden spades. The numbers given are 195 owning diamond rings, 367 owning golf clubs, and 562 owning garden spades. 

Now, some residents own exactly two of these four items, and some own exactly three. The exact numbers are 437 owning exactly two things and 234 owning exactly three. The question is asking how many residents own all four items. 

Hmm, this sounds like a problem involving sets and maybe using the principle of inclusion-exclusion. I've heard about that before. Let me recall how that works. 

Inclusion-exclusion is a formula used to calculate the number of elements in the union of multiple sets. For four sets, the formula would involve adding the sizes of each set, subtracting the sizes of all possible two-set intersections, adding back in the sizes of all possible three-set intersections, and so on. But wait, in this case, we don't have all those intersection numbers directly. Instead, we have information about how many people own exactly two or exactly three items. 

Let me think. Maybe I can model this using variables for the different overlaps. Let's denote:
- D as the set of people owning a diamond ring,
- G as those owning golf clubs,
- S as those owning a garden spade,
- C as those owning candy hearts (which everyone has, so C is the universal set here).

Wait, no, actually, the candy hearts are a given to all 900 residents. So, everyone is part of set C. So, each resident owns at least C. The other three items (D, G, S) are optional. 

So, the problem is about the overlaps between D, G, S, and C. But since C is universal, every other set is a subset of C. So, any ownership of D, G, or S is in addition to C. 

Our variables are:
- Exactly two items: 437 people own exactly two of D, G, S, and C. Wait, but since
