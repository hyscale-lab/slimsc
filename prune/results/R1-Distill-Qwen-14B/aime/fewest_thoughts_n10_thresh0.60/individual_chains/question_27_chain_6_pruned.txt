Okay, so I have this problem about a torus and a sphere. Hmm, let me try to visualize it. A torus is like a donut shape, right? So, it's formed by revolving a circle around an axis. In this case, the circle has a radius of 3 units, and the axis is in the plane of the circle, 6 units away from the center. So, the distance from the center of the generating circle to the axis is 6, and the radius of the generating circle is 3. 

I remember that a torus can be described using two radii: the major radius, which is the distance from the center of the generating circle to the axis of revolution, and the minor radius, which is the radius of the generating circle itself. So here, the major radius R is 6, and the minor radius r is 3.

Now, there's a sphere with radius 11. The torus can rest on the inside or the outside of this sphere. When it's inside, it's internally tangent along a circle, and when it's outside, it's externally tangent along another circle. The radii of these tangent circles are r_i and r_o respectively. We need to find the difference r_i - r_o and express it as a reduced fraction m/n, then find m + n.

Alright, let me think about the geometry here. When the torus is inside the sphere, it's tangent along a circle. Similarly, when it's outside, it's tangent along another circle. So, the sphere and torus touch at exactly one point along each of these circles.

I think I need to find the radii of these circles of tangency. Let me consider the case when the torus is inside the sphere first.

So, when the torus is inside the sphere, the sphere has a radius of 11, and the torus is tangent to it. Since the torus is inside, the sphere is larger. The point of tangency would be where the surfaces just touch each other.

I need to model this mathematically. Maybe I should think in terms of coordinates. Let me set up a coordinate system where the center of the sphere is at the origin (0,0,0). The torus is centered at some point along, say, the z-axis. Wait, but actually, since the torus is generated by revolving a circle around an axis, perhaps it's more convenient to place the axis of the torus along the z-axis?

Wait, no, because the torus is being placed inside the sphere. Maybe it's better to think about the sphere and the torus sharing a common center? Or not necessarily? Hmm, I'm not sure.

Wait, no. Let me think again. When the torus is inside the sphere and tangent, the closest point on the torus to the center of the sphere should be equal to the sphere's radius minus something. Hmm, maybe not. Alternatively, perhaps the distance from the center of the sphere to the center of the generating circle of the torus is such that the maximum extent of the torus just touches the sphere.

Wait, maybe I should recall the general equation of a torus. The standard equation for a torus centered at the origin with major radius R and minor radius r is:

(√(x² + y²) - R)² + z² = r²

So, in this case, R is 6, r is 3. So the equation is (√(x² + y²) - 6)² + z² = 9.

Now, the sphere has equation x² + y² + z² = 11² = 121.

We need to find the circles where these two surfaces are tangent. So, we can set up the equations and find where they are tangent.

Let me try to find the points of tangency. Since both are surfaces of revolution around the z-axis, their points of tangency should lie in a plane perpendicular to the z-axis. So, we can consider a cross-sectional view in the x-z plane, for example. So, let's look at the cross-section.

In the x-z plane, the equation of the torus becomes (|x| - 6)^2 + z^2 = 9.

And the equation of the sphere is x² + z² = 121.

We can solve these two equations and find where they are tangent. For tangency, the system should have exactly one solution, meaning the discriminant of the resulting equation is zero.

Let me solve the system:

1. (|x| - 6)^2 + z^2 = 9
2. x² + z² = 121

Subtracting equation 1 from equation 2:

x² + z² - [(|x| - 6)^2 + z²] = 121 - 9

Simplify:

x² - (|x| - 6)^2 = 112

Let me expand (|x| - 6)^2:

(|x| - 6)^2 = |x|² - 12|x| + 36

But |x|² is just x², since squaring removes the absolute value.

So,

x² - (x² - 12|x| + 36) = 112

Simplify:

x² - x² +12|x| -36 =112

Which reduces to:

12|x| -36 =112

12|x| = 148

|x| = 148 /12 = 37/3 ≈12.333...

Wait, but that seems too big. Because the torus has a major radius of 6, so the maximum x it can reach is 6 + 3 =9.
