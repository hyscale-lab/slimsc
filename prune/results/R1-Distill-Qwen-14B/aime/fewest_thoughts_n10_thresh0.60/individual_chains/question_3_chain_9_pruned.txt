Okay, so I have this probability problem here about Jen entering a lottery. Let me try to understand it step by step. 

So, Jen picks 4 distinct numbers from the set S which is {1,2,3,...,10}. Then, 4 numbers are randomly chosen from S as well. She wins a prize if at least two of her numbers match the randomly chosen ones. She wins the grand prize if all four of her numbers match. 

The question is asking for the probability that she wins the grand prize given that she won a prize. They mention this probability is m/n where m and n are coprime, and we need to find m + n.

Hmm, okay. So, this is a conditional probability problem. I remember that conditional probability is P(A|B) = P(A ∩ B) / P(B), which is the probability of A happening given that B has happened. In this case, A is winning the grand prize, and B is winning a prize. Since winning the grand prize automatically means she has at least two correct numbers, A is a subset of B. So, P(A ∩ B) is just P(A). 

So, the probability we need is P(A) / P(B). So, I need to compute P(A) and P(B). 

First, let's figure out the total number of possible ways the lottery can be drawn. Since 4 numbers are chosen from 10, the total number of possible combinations is C(10,4), which is 210. 

Now, let's compute P(A), the probability that Jen wins the grand prize. That is, all four of her numbers are the same as the four chosen. Since she has exactly one specific set of four numbers, there's only one favorable outcome. So, P(A) is 1 / C(10,4) = 1/210.

Next, we need to compute P(B), the probability that Jen wins a prize. Winning a prize means she has at least two numbers matching the four chosen. So, this includes scenarios where she has exactly two, exactly three, or exactly four numbers matching. 

So, P(B) is the sum of the probabilities of having exactly two, exactly three, or exactly four matches. 

Let me compute each of these probabilities.

First, the number of ways to choose exactly k numbers matching out of four. So, for exactly four, as we saw, it's just 1 way.

For exactly three numbers matching: We need to choose 3 numbers from Jen's 4, and 1 number from the remaining 6 numbers in the set S. So, the number of favorable combinations is C(4,3) * C(6,1) = 4 * 6 = 24.

Similarly, for exactly two numbers matching: We choose 2 from Jen's 4, and 2 from the remaining 6. So, that's C(4,2) * C(6,2) = 6 * 15 = 90.

For exactly one number matching, wait, but since she needs at least two, we don't include that in P(B). So, the total number of favorable outcomes for B is 1 (for exactly four) + 24 (for exactly three) + 90 (for exactly two) = 115.

Therefore, the probability P(B) is 115 / 210. Let me check that again. Wait, 1 + 24 + 90 is indeed 115. So, 115/210 can be simplified. Dividing numerator and denominator by 5 gives 23/42. So, P(B) is 23/42.

Wait, hold on. Let me double-check my numbers for exactly two and three. 

When calculating exactly k matches, the formula is C(4,k) * C(6,4−k), because we choose k from Jen's numbers and (4−k) from the non-Jen numbers. Wait, is that correct? Let me think.

No, actually, if she has exactly k numbers matching, the number is C(4,k) * C(6, 4−k). So, for k=2, it's C(4,2)*C(6,2)=6*15=90, which I had. For k=3, it's C(4,3)*C(6,1)=4*6=24. For k=4, it's C(4,4)*C(6,0)=1*1=1. So, yes, that's correct. Sum is 90 +24 +1=115, so 115/210 is correct.

So, P(A) is 1/210, and P(B) is 115/210.

Therefore, the conditional probability P(A|B) is (1/210) / (115/210) = 1/115.

Wait, that seems straightforward. Let me make sure I didn't mess up the conditional probability formula. So, the formula is P(A|B) = P(A ∩ B)/P(B). But since A is a subset of B (if you have all four numbers matching, you must
