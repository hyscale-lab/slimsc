Okay, so Alice and Bob are playing this game where they take turns removing either 1 or 4 tokens from a stack of n tokens. Alice goes first, and whoever takes the last token wins. I need to figure out how many positive integers n â‰¤ 2024 allow Bob to have a winning strategy, no matter how Alice plays.

Hmm, let's break this down. It sounds like a classic combinatorial game theory problem. The key is to figure out for each n whether the first player (Alice) can force a win or if the second player (Bob) can. So, I'm looking for the values of n where Bob can win, regardless of Alice's moves.

I remember that in such games, positions can be classified as either winning or losing positions. A winning position is one where the current player can force a win, and a losing position is the opposite. So, if n is a losing position for Alice, then Bob can win.

Let me start by analyzing small values of n to see if I can find a pattern.

n=1: Alice takes 1 token and wins. So, Bob can't win here. So, n=1 is a winning position for Alice.

n=2: Alice can take 1 token, leaving n=1 for Bob, who then takes the last one and wins. Wait, no, wait. If Alice takes 1 token, n becomes 1, then Bob takes the last one and wins. But wait, Alice's goal is to take the last token. So if Alice leaves n=1 for Bob, Bob can take it and win. So, n=2 is a losing position for Alice, meaning Bob can win.

Wait, wait. Let me think again. If n=2, Alice's options are to take 1 or 4. She can't take 4 because there are only 2 tokens. So she takes 1, leaving n=1 for Bob. Bob then takes 1 and wins. So, if n=2, Alice can't prevent Bob from winning. So n=2 is a losing position for Alice, meaning Bob can win. So, n=2 is one of the numbers we need to count.

n=3: Alice can take 1 token, leaving n=2 for Bob. From the previous step, n=2 is a losing position for Bob, meaning Alice can win. Wait, no. Let me clarify: If Alice leaves Bob with n=
