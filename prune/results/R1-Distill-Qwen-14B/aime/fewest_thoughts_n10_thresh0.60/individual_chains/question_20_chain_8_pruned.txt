Okay, so I've got this math problem here about placing chips on a 5x5 grid. Let me try to understand it step by step. 

The problem states that there are 25 white chips and 25 black chips, all indistinguishable. We need to place some of these chips in the 25 unit cells of a 5x5 grid. Each cell can hold at most one chip. 

The conditions are:
1. All chips in the same row must be the same color.
2. All chips in the same column must be the same color.
3. Additionally, any extra chip placed would violate one or more of the previous two conditions.

Wait, so the third condition is saying that the configuration is maximal, right? Meaning we can't add any more chips without breaking the first two rules.

Hmm, so I need to count the number of such maximal configurations. Let me think about what these configurations would look like.

First, let's consider the conditions. Each row must be all white or all black, same with each column. So, if a row is all white, then every cell in that row has a white chip. Similarly for black. But since each cell can have at most one chip, each cell can only be white or black, depending on the row and column.

Wait, but if both the row and the column are constrained, that might lead to some conflicts. For example, if I decide that row 1 is all white and column 1 is all white, then cell (1,1) is white. But if row 2 is all black and column 1 is all white, then cell (2,1) is white, which is okay because row 2 is all black, but wait, that cell is in row 2 which is supposed to be all black. Oh, no, that's a problem. So that would be conflicting.

Wait, so if a row is all white, then any column that intersects with it must also be all white. Because if a column has a white chip in that cell, but the column is supposed to be all the same color. So, if row i is all white, then every column that intersects row i at some cell must also be all white. Similarly, if a column is all black, then every row that intersects that column must also be all black.

But that seems restrictive. Because if I have a row that's all white, then all the columns intersecting it must also
