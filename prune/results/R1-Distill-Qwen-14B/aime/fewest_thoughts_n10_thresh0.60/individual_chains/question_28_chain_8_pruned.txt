Okay, so I'm trying to solve this geometry problem about a tetrahedron. Let me read it again carefully.

We have a tetrahedron ABCD with specific edge lengths: AB = CD = sqrt(41), AC = BD = sqrt(80), and BC = AD = sqrt(89). There's a point I inside the tetrahedron such that the distances from I to each of the four faces are all equal. We need to find this distance, which can be written in the form m*sqrt(n)/p, where m, n, p are positive integers, m and p are coprime, and n is square-free. Then, compute m + n + p.

Hmm. So, this point I is equidistant from all four faces. I remember that in a tetrahedron, the point equidistant from all four faces is called the incenter, analogous to the incenter of a triangle. The distance from the incenter to each face is the inradius.

So, to find this distance, I think we can use the formula involving the volume of the tetrahedron and the surface areas of its faces. I recall that for a tetrahedron, the inradius r is equal to 3 times the volume divided by the sum of the areas of the four faces. So, r = 3V / S, where S is the total surface area.

Therefore, I need to find the volume V of the tetrahedron and the total surface area S.

But wait, the tetrahedron is not regularâ€”it has edges of different lengths. But the way the edges are paired suggests some kind of symmetry. Let me note the given edge lengths:

AB = CD = sqrt(41)
AC = BD = sqrt(80)
BC = AD = sqrt(89)

So, each pair of opposite edges are equal. That makes me think this is a kind of "isohedral" tetrahedron, but not regular. I think this might be a tetrahedron where each pair of opposite edges are equal, which might have some special properties.

I remember that in such a tetrahedron, the opposite edges are equal, so perhaps it's a kind of "equifacial" tetrahedron, but I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, maybe it's a "disphenoid," which is a tetrahedron where opposite edges are equal. Yes, I think that's right. A disphenoid has four congruent triangular faces, but wait, in this case, the edges are equal in pairs, but the faces might not be congruent. Wait, no, in a disphenoid, all four faces are congruent, but here, the faces might not necessarily be congruent because the edges are of different lengths. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps they are congruent. Let me check. If AB = CD, AC = BD, BC = AD, then each face is a triangle with sides sqrt(41), sqrt(80), sqrt(89). Because each face would have one edge from each pair. So, for example, triangle ABC would have edges AB = sqrt(41), BC = sqrt(89), and AC = sqrt(80). Similarly, triangle BCD would have edges BC = sqrt
