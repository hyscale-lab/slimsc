Okay, so I've got this math problem here about something called "b-eautiful" numbers. Let me try to understand what it's asking.

So, the problem says: Let b be an integer greater than or equal to 2. A positive integer n is called b-eautiful if two conditions are met. First, when n is expressed in base b, it has exactly two digits. Second, the sum of these two digits equals the square root of n. 

They even gave an example: 81 is 13-eautiful because when you write 81 in base 13, it's 6 and 3, so 6 + 3 = 9, which is sqrt(81). Cool, that makes sense.

The task is to find the least integer b (b >= 2) for which there are more than ten b-eautiful integers. So, I need to find the smallest base b where there are more than 10 numbers n that satisfy the b-eautiful condition.

Alright, let's break this down. First, let's understand what it means for a number to have exactly two digits in base b. In base b, the two-digit numbers range from b^1 to b^2 - 1. So, the smallest two-digit number in base b is 10_b, which is equal to b in decimal, and the largest is (b^2 - 1)_b, which is b^2 - 1 in decimal.

So, any two-digit number in base b is of the form n = a * b + c, where a and c are the digits. But since it's a two-digit number, a can't be zero, and c can be zero or more. Also, since it's base b, a must be less than b, and c must be less than b as well.

Another important point is that the sum of the digits a + c must equal sqrt(n). So, sqrt(n) must be an integer because a and c are integers, and their sum is an integer. Therefore, n must be a perfect square.

Wait, that's a key insight. So, n is a perfect square because sqrt(n) is an integer. So, n = k^2, where k is a positive integer. Therefore, the condition is that a + c = k, and n = a * b + c = k^2.

So, substituting, we have a * b + c = k^2, and a + c = k. So, we can write c = k - a. Substituting into the first equation:

a * b + (k - a) = k^2

Simplify this:

a * b + k - a = k^2

Factor out a:

a * (b - 1) + k = k^2

Then, rearranged:

a * (b - 1) = k^2 - k

So,

a = (k^2 - k) / (b - 1)

Hmm, interesting. So, for given b, and for some k, a must equal (k^2 - k)/(b - 1). But a must also satisfy the digit constraints: a < b and a >= 1 (since it's the leading digit), and c = k - a must satisfy c < b.

So, for a given b, we can iterate over possible k values, compute a, and check if a is an integer, a >=1, a < b, and c = k - a is also >=0 and <b.

Wait, but the problem is to find the minimal b such that there are more than ten b-eautiful numbers. So, for each b, I need to find the number of n (which are k^2) that satisfy the above conditions.

So, perhaps I can model this as a function for a given b, how many valid k's exist such that a is an integer, a and c are digits in base b.

Let me think
