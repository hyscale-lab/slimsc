Okay, so I've got this math problem here, and I need to figure out how long Aya's walk takes when she walks at a speed of s + 1/2 km/h. Hmm, let me read the problem again to make sure I understand all the details.

Every morning, Aya goes for a 9-kilometer-long walk and stops at a coffee shop afterward. Her walking speed is s kilometers per hour, and when she walks at this speed, her entire trip—walking plus coffee shop time—takes 4 hours. But when she increases her speed to s + 2 km/h, the walking part alone takes less time, and the whole trip, including the coffee time, takes 2 hours and 24 minutes. I need to find out how long the walk takes her when she walks at s + 1/2 km/h, including the coffee shop time.

Wait, let me rephrase that to make sure I got it right. The problem gives me two scenarios:

1. At speed s km/h, total time (walking + coffee) is 4 hours.
2. At speed s + 2 km/h, total time is 2 hours and 24 minutes, which is 2.4 hours, right? Because 24 minutes is 0.4 hours.

So, the coffee shop time is the same in both cases, denoted by t minutes. So, I can set up equations based on these two scenarios.

First, let me note down the given data.

Distance walked each day: 9 km.

Case 1: Speed = s km/h. Total time = 4 hours = 240 minutes. This includes walking time plus t minutes at the coffee shop.

Case 2: Speed = s + 2 km/h. Total time = 2 hours 24 minutes = 144 minutes. Again, this includes walking time plus t minutes.

Wait, but in both cases, the coffee time is the same, t. So, the difference in total time is due to the difference in walking time. So, the walking time must be less when she walks faster, which makes sense.

Let me write the equations.

In Case 1:

Walking time = distance / speed = 9 / s hours.

Total time = walking time + coffee time. But the total time is given in hours, 4 hours. However, coffee time is t minutes, which is t/60 hours. So,

Walking time (hours) + t/60 hours = 4 hours.

So equation 1: (9 / s) + (t / 60) = 4.

Similarly, in Case 2:

Walking time = 9 / (s + 2) hours.

Total time is 2 hours 24 minutes, which is 2 + 24/60 = 2.4 hours.

So,

(9 / (s + 2)) + (t / 60) = 2.4.

That's equation 2.

So, now I have two equations:

1. (9 / s) + (t / 60) = 4.

2. (9 / (s + 2)) + (t / 60) = 2.4.

Hmm, so I can subtract equation 2 from equation 1 to eliminate t.

Let me write that:

Equation 1: (9/s) + (t/60) = 4.

Equation 2: (9/(s + 2)) + (t/60) = 2.4.

Subtracting equation 2 from equation 1:

(9/s - 9/(s + 2)) + (t/60 - t/60) = 4 - 2.4.

Which simplifies to:

9/s - 9/(s + 2) = 1.6.

Because t/60 cancels out.

So, 9/s - 9/(s + 2) = 1.6.

Let me compute this:

Factor out 9:

9[1/s - 1/(s + 2)] = 1.6.

Compute the expression inside the brackets:

1/s - 1/(s + 2) = [(s + 2) - s] / [s(s + 2)] = 2 / [s(s + 2)].

So, 9 * [2 / (s(s + 2))] = 1.6.

Which is 18 / [s(s + 2)] = 1.6.

Let me write this as:

18 = 1.6 * s(s + 2).

So, 1.6 s(s + 2) = 18.

I can write 1.6 as 8/5 to make it easier for fraction calculations.

So, (8/5) * s(s + 2) = 18.

Multiply both sides by 5/8 to solve for s(s + 2):

s(s + 2) = 18 * (5/8) = (90)/8 = 45/4.

So, s(s + 2) = 45/4.

Let me write that as:

s^2 + 2s = 45/4.

Multiply both sides by 4 to eliminate the denominator:

4s^2 + 8s = 45.

Bring all terms to one side:

4s^2 + 8s - 45 = 0.

Now, that's a quadratic equation in the form ax^2 + bx + c = 0.

Let me compute the discriminant D:

D = b^2 - 4ac = (8)^2 - 4 * 4 * (-45) = 64 + 720 = 784.

Square root of D is sqrt(784) = 28.

So, solutions are:

s = [-8 ± 28]/(2*4) = (-8 ± 28)/8.

We have two possible solutions:

1. s = (-8 + 28)/8 = 20/8 = 5/2 = 2.5 km/h.

2. s = (-8 - 28)/8 = -36/8 = -4.5 km/h.

But speed can't be negative, so s = 2.5 km/h.

So, Aya's walking speed is 2.5 km/h.

Now, let me find t.

Using equation 1: (9/s) + (t / 60) = 4.

Plug in s = 2.5:

9 / 2.5 = 3.6 hours.

So,

3.6 + (t / 60) = 4.

Subtract 3.6:

t / 60 = 0.4.

Multiply both sides by 60:

t = 24 minutes.

So, the coffee shop time is 24 minutes.

Wait, let me check this with equation 2.

Equation 2: (9/(s + 2)) + (t/60) = 2.4.

s + 2 = 2.5 + 2 = 4.5 km/h.

Walking time: 9 / 4.5 = 2 hours.

So, 2 + (t/60) = 2.4.

t/60 = 0.
