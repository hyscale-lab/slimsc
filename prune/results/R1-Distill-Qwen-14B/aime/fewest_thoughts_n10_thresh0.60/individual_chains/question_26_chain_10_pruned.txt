Okay, so I'm trying to solve this geometry problem where I have triangle ABC inscribed in a circle ω. The tangents at B and C meet at point D, and then AD intersects ω again at P. The sides AB = 5, BC = 9, and AC = 10. I need to find AP expressed as a fraction m/n where m and n are coprime, and then find m + n.

First, let me sketch out what I know. Triangle ABC has sides AB=5, BC=9, AC=10. So, it's a scalene triangle. The circle ω is the circumcircle of ABC. Then, the tangents at B and C intersect at D. From point D, we draw a line AD which intersects ω again at point P. I need to find the length AP.

Hmm, okay. So, tangents from a common external point to a circle are equal in length. That means DB = DC because they're both tangents from D to ω. That might come in handy.

I remember that if you have two tangents from a point outside the circle, the lengths are equal. So, DB = DC, as I thought. So, triangle DBC is isoceles with DB = DC.

Also, point D is the exsimilicenter or the external homothety center of the tangents from B and C. Maybe homothety could be a useful concept here. Alternatively, perhaps using power of a point.

Wait, the power of point D with respect to ω. The power of D should be equal to DB^2, since DB is the tangent from D to ω. Similarly, DC^2 is the power as well. So, power of D is DB^2 = DC^2.

But also, the power of D can be expressed as DA * DP, because AD passes through the circle, so DA * DP = DB^2.

Yes, that seems important. So, DA * DP = DB^2.

If I can find DA, then I can find DP, and then AP would be DA - DP or DP - DA, depending on the direction. Wait, actually, let me think.

AD is a line from A to D, passing through ω at P. So, starting from A, going through P, then to D. So, AP is the segment from A to P, and PD is from P to D. So, the entire length AD is AP + PD. So, the power of point D gives us DA * DP = DB^2.

But I don't know DA yet. So, perhaps I can find DA in another way.

Alternatively, maybe I should find coordinates for all the points. Let me try coordinate geometry.

Let me place the triangle ABC in a coordinate system. Let me put point C at the origin (0,0) to simplify things. Then, point A is at (10,0) since AC = 10. Point B is somewhere in the plane; I need to find its coordinates.

Given that AB = 5, BC = 9, and AC=10. So, coordinates: A(10,0), C(0,0), and B(x,y). Let me find x and y.

Distance from A to B is
