Okay, so I have this math problem here, and I need to figure out the sum of the squares of all the items in the list. Let me read the problem again carefully to make sure I understand all the conditions.

The problem states:

A list of positive integers has the following properties:

1. The sum of the items in the list is 30.
2. The unique mode of the list is 9.
3. The median of the list is a positive integer that does not appear in the list itself.

I need to find the sum of the squares of all the items in the list.

Alright, let's break this down step by step.

First, let's recall some definitions to make sure I'm on the same page:

- **Mode**: The mode is the number that appears most frequently in the list. A unique mode means that 9 appears more times than any other number.
- **Median**: The median is the middle number when the numbers are arranged in order. If the list has an odd number of elements, it's the middle one. If even, it's the average of the two middle ones. But in this case, the median is a positive integer that doesn't appear in the list. That's interesting.

So, let's think about the structure of the list. Since the mode is 9, 9 must appear more times than any other number. Let's denote the number of times 9 appears as k. So, k has to be greater than the count of any other number in the list.

The sum of all numbers is 30, so the sum of all the elements is 30.

Now, the median is a positive integer not present in the list. Let's think about what that implies.

If the median is a positive integer not in the list, then the list must have an even number of elements because if it were odd, the median would be one of the elements in the list. Wait, no, actually, no. Wait, let me think again.

Wait, no. For a list with an odd number of elements, the median is the middle element, which is part of the list. So, if the median is not in the list, that implies that the list must have an even number of elements, because then the median is the average of the two middle numbers. So, if the average is an integer not present in the list, that's possible.

So, the list must have an even number of elements. Let's denote the number of elements as n, which is even. Let's say n = 2m. Then the median would be the average of the m-th and (m+1)-th elements.

But wait, for the median to be an integer not in the list, the average of the two middle numbers must be an integer not present in the list. So, the two middle numbers must add up to an even number because their average is an integer. Therefore, the two middle numbers must be both even or both odd.

But since the median is not in the list, that means that the two middle numbers are different from each other, and their average is not present anywhere else in the list.

Wait, but the two middle numbers could be the same, but in that case, the median would be equal to them, which is in the list. So, no, to have the median not in the list, the two middle numbers must be different, and their average must not be in the list.

So, let's formalize this:

Letâ€™s denote the list as a sorted list: a1, a2, ..., an, where n is even.

Median = (a_{n/2} + a_{n/2 +
