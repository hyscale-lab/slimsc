Okay, so I have this geometry problem here. Let me read it again to make sure I get all the details right.

We have triangle ABC with circumcenter O and incenter I. The line IA is perpendicular to OI. The circumradius is 13, and the inradius is 6. We need to find the product AB · AC.

Hmm, okay. So, let's break this down. First, I know that the circumradius R is given as 13, and the inradius r is 6. The inradius is the radius of the incircle, which touches all three sides of the triangle, while the circumradius is the radius of the circumscribed circle passing through all three vertices.

The key condition here is that IA is perpendicular to OI. That means the line from the incenter I to vertex A is perpendicular to the line connecting the incenter I and the circumcenter O. That seems like an important relationship. I think this might involve some properties or theorems related to triangle centers or maybe some coordinate geometry.

Let me recall some properties of triangle centers. The circumcenter O is the intersection of the perpendicular bisectors, and the incenter I is the intersection of the angle bisectors. In some cases, these points can coincide or have specific relationships depending on the type of triangle. But in general, they are different points.

Given that IA ⊥ OI, maybe we can find a relationship between the lengths of IA, OI, and the sides of the triangle. I remember that in a triangle, the distance between the incenter and circumcenter can be found using the formula:

OI² = R(R - 2r)

Where R is the circumradius and r is the inradius. Let me verify that formula. Yes, I think that's correct. So, plugging in the given values, OI² = 13(13 - 2*6) = 13(13 - 12) = 13*1 = 13. So OI = sqrt(13).

Wait, but OI is sqrt(13), and IA is perpendicular to OI. So IA and OI form a right angle at point I. So triangle AIO is a right-angled triangle at I. So, in triangle AIO, angle at I is 90 degrees.

In this right triangle, we can apply the Pythagorean theorem. So, AI² + OI² = AO².

We know OI is sqrt(13), so OI² is 13. AO is the distance from A to O. But wait, AO is the circumradius because O is the circumcenter. So AO = R = 13. Therefore, AO² = 13² = 169.

So plugging into Pythagorean theorem: AI² + 13 = 169 => AI² = 169 -13 = 156 => AI = sqrt(156) = 2*sqrt(39).

Hmm, okay, so AI is 2*sqrt(39). I need to relate this to the sides of the triangle. I remember
