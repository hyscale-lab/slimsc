Okay, so I have this problem about a torus and a sphere. Let me try to visualize it first. A torus is like a donut shape, right? It's formed by revolving a circle around an axis that's in the same plane as the circle but doesn't intersect it. In this case, the circle has a radius of 3, and the distance from the center of the circle to the axis of revolution is 6. So the major radius (the distance from the center of the tube to the center of the torus) is 6, and the minor radius (the radius of the tube itself) is 3.

Now, there's a sphere with radius 11. The torus can rest on the inside of this sphere, meaning it's inside the sphere and tangent to it along a circle. Similarly, it can rest on the outside, meaning it's outside the sphere and tangent to it along another circle. I need to find the radii of these two circles of tangency, r_i and r_o, and then compute their difference, which will be a fraction m/n. Finally, I have to find m + n where m and n are coprime.

First, let's think about the torus. The standard equation for a torus in 3D coordinates, centered at the origin, with the z-axis as the axis of revolution, is:

((√(x² + y²) - R)² + z²) = r²

where R is the major radius (6 in this case) and r is the minor radius (3 here).

But since the problem is dealing with the torus resting inside and outside the sphere, maybe it's easier to think in terms of the distance between the centers of the sphere and the torus.

Wait, but the sphere is of radius 11, and the torus is inside or outside. Hmm.

When the torus is inside the sphere, the sphere is larger, so the torus is entirely within the sphere, touching it along a circle where their surfaces meet. Similarly, when the torus is outside, it's touching the sphere externally along another circle.

I think the key here is to find the distance from the center of the sphere to the center of the torus in both cases (resting inside and outside), and then using that to find the radii of the circles of tangency.

Wait, let me clarify. The torus is generated by revolving a circle of radius 3 around an axis 6 units away. So, the center of the generating circle is 6 units from the axis. So the major radius R is 6, minor radius r is 3.

When the torus is resting on the inside of the sphere of radius 11, the center of the torus must be some distance from the center of the sphere. Let's denote the distance between the centers as d_i when it's inside, and d_o when it's outside.

In the case of internal tangency, the sphere and torus touch along a circle. For the torus inside the sphere, the farthest point of the torus from the sphere's center would be the distance from the sphere's center to the torus's center plus the major radius of
