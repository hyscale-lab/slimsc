Okay, so I need to find the number of intersections between the graphs of two equations: 

1. \( y = 4 g(f(\sin (2 \pi x))) \)
2. \( x = 4 g(f(\cos (3 \pi y))) \)

Hmm, that's a bit complicated. Let's break it down step by step.

First, let's understand the functions f and g. 

We have \( f(x) = ||x| - 1/2| \) and \( g(x) = ||x| - 1/4| \). 

These are both functions that involve absolute values, so they're probably V-shaped or have some symmetry. Let me visualize f(x) and g(x) first.

For f(x):
- The inner part is |x|, which is a V-shape with the vertex at (0,0).
- Then we subtract 1/2: |x| - 1/2. This shifts the graph down by 1/2. So the vertex is now at (0, -1/2).
- Then we take the absolute value again: ||x| - 1/2|. This will reflect any negative parts back above the x-axis. So where |x| - 1/2 is negative (between -1/2 and 1/2), the function becomes 1/2 - |x|. So f(x) is a V-shape that has its vertex at (0, 1/2) and goes down to (1/2, 0) and (-1/2, 0), then up again.

Similarly, for g(x):
- Start with |x|, then subtract 1/4: |x| - 1/4.
- Take the absolute value: ||x| - 1/4|. So, similar to f(x), but shifted less. The vertex is at (0, 1/4). It has two points where it touches the x-axis at x = ±1/4.

Now, let's consider the compositions.

First, \( f(\sin(2\pi x)) \): 

So, f is applied to the sine function. The sine function oscillates between -1 and 1. So, let's see what f does to the sine input.

Since sin(2πx) oscillates between -1 and 1, f will take that and process it as follows:

f(sin(2πx)) = || sin(2πx) | - 1/2 |.

Similarly, g of that would be:

g(f(sin(2πx))) = || f(sin(2πx)) | - 1/4 |. But wait, f(sin(...)) is already an absolute value, so f(sin(...)) is non-negative. So, g(f(sin(...))) is | | f(sin(...)) | - 1/4 |, but since f(sin(...)) is non-negative, this is just | f(sin(...)) - 1/4 |.

But f(sin(...)) is || sin(...) - 1/2 |, so let's think about that.

Wait, perhaps it's better to first compute f(sin(2πx)) and then see how g acts on it.

Let me try to compute f(sin(2πx)):

Let me set z = sin(2πx). Then, f(z) = ||z| - 1/2|.

So, for z in [-1,1], |z| is in [0,1]. Then subtract 1/2: |z| - 1/2 can be in [-1/2, 1/2]. Taking the absolute value again, f(z) is 1/2 - |z| when |z| ≤ 1/2, and |z| - 1/2 when |z| > 1/2.

So f(z) is a function that goes from 0 to 1/2 as |z| goes from 1/2 to 0, and back to 0 as |z| approaches 1.

Similarly, g(f(z)) is ||f(z) - 1/4|.

Since f(z) is between 0 and 1/2, let's see:

If f(z) is between 0 and 1/4, then |f(z) - 1/4| = 1/4 - f(z).

If f(z) is between 1/4 and 1/2, then |f(z) - 1/4| = f(z) - 1/4.

So, g(f(z)) is a piecewise function. Let's plot it:

- When f(z) is in [0, 1/4], g(f(z)) is 1/4 - f(z).
- When f(z) is in [1/4, 1/2], g(f(z)) is f(z) - 1/4.

So g(f(z)) will have a V-shape that starts at 1/4 when f(z)=0, decreases to 0 when f(z)=1/4, then increases again to 1/4*(1/2 - 1/4) = 1/8 when f(z)=1/2. Wait, no, let me compute that.

Wait, when f(z)=1/2, which is the maximum, then g(f(z)) would be |1/2 - 1/4| = 1/4.

Wait, no: Wait, g(f(z))= |f(z) - 1/4|. So when f(z)=1/2, |1/2 - 1/4|=1/4.

So, when f(z) increases from 0 to 1/2:

- From f(z)=0 to f(z)=1/4, g(f(z)) = 1/4 - f(z), which decreases from 1/4 to 0.
- From f(z)=1/4 to f(z)=1/2, g(f(z)) = f(z) - 1/4, which increases from 0 to 1/4.

So, the graph of g(f(z)) is a V-sh
