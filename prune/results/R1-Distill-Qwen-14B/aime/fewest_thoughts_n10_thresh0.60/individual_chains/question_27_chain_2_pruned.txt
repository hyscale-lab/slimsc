Alright, so I'm trying to solve this geometry problem about a torus and a sphere. Let me read through the problem again to make sure I get all the details right.

We have a torus T, which is formed by revolving a circle of radius 3 around an axis in the plane of the circle. The distance from the center of the circle to the axis is 6 units. So, I imagine it's like a donut shape where the circular hole has a radius of 3, and the distance from the center of the generating circle to the axis is 6. That means the major radius of the torus is 6, and the minor radius is 3. 

Then, we have a sphere S with radius 11. The problem states that when the torus rests on the inside of the sphere, it's internally tangent along a circle with radius r_i, and when it rests on the outside, it's externally tangent along a circle with radius r_o. We need to find the difference r_i - r_o, express it as a reduced fraction m/n, and then find m + n.

Hmm, okay. So, the torus can be placed inside the sphere and tangent to it, and also outside, tangent as well. The tangency happens along a circle, which has a certain radius on the torus's surface. So, I need to find both r_i and r_o and then compute their difference.

Let me recall some properties of tori and spheres. A torus can be thought of as a surface of revolution generated by rotating a circle around an external axis. The distance from the center of the generating circle to the axis is called the major radius, R, and the radius of the generating circle is the minor radius, r. In this case, R is 6 and r is 3.

Now, when the torus is inside the sphere, it's tangent to the sphere along a circle. Similarly, when it's outside, it's tangent along another circle. I think these tangent circles are related to the points where the torus just touches the sphere.

I remember that the general equation for a torus is (sqrt(x² + y²) - R)² + z² = r², but I might need to think in terms of coordinates. Alternatively, maybe using the concept of the sphere and the torus in 3D space, considering their centers and how they're positioned relative to each other.

Wait, the sphere has a radius of 11. So, when the torus is inside, the sphere's center must coincide with the torus's center, right? Because otherwise, the torus would be off-center, and the tangency might not form a perfect circle. Similarly, when the torus is outside the sphere, it's probably centered at the same point as the sphere.

So, if both the sphere and the torus share the same center, the torus is centered at the origin, same as the sphere. Then, when the torus is inside the sphere, the sphere's surface is at a distance of 11 from the center, and the torus is inside it. The point of tangency would be where the sphere and torus touch, and that happens along a circle.

Similarly, when the torus is externally tangent, it must be that the sphere is inside the torus, so the sphere is tangent to the torus at another circle. But wait, actually, when the torus is outside, the sphere is inside the torus? Or is it the other way around?

Wait, no. If the torus is outside the sphere, meaning the sphere is inside the torus, then the sphere is tangent to the torus from the inside. But the problem says when the torus rests on the outside of S, it's externally tangent. So, perhaps the torus is placed such that it's outside the sphere, and the sphere is inside the torus, touching it along a circle.

I need to clarify this. When the torus is inside the sphere, it's internally tangent. So, the sphere is larger, and the torus is inside, touching the sphere. When the torus is outside the sphere,
