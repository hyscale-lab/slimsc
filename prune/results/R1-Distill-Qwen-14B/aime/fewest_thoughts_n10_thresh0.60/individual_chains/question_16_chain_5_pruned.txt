Okay, so I'm trying to solve this math problem where I need to find the least prime number p such that there's some positive integer n where p² divides n⁴ + 1. Then, I have to find the smallest m where m⁴ + 1 is divisible by p². Hmm, okay, let me think about this step by step.

First, I know that primes are numbers greater than 1 that have no divisors other than 1 and themselves. The primes start at 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, and so on. Since the question is about divisibility by p², I'm looking for primes where p² divides n⁴ + 1 for some n.

I remember that if a prime p divides a number like n⁴ + 1, then n⁸ ≡ 1 mod p. Because n⁴ ≡ -1 mod p, so squaring both sides gives n⁸ ≡ 1 mod p. That means the order of n modulo p divides 8. But since n⁴ ≡ -1 mod p, the order can't be 1, 2, or 4 because n^k would be 1 mod p for those k's. So the order must be 8. Therefore, 8 divides p-1 because the multiplicative order modulo p divides p-1 by Fermat's little theorem. So p must be ≡ 1 mod 8.

Wait, but does that apply to all primes p where p² divides n⁴ +1? Or only for primes where p divides n⁴ +1? I think it's for primes where p divides n⁴ +1. So if p² divides n⁴ +1, then p must divide n⁴ +1, so the same logic applies: the order of n mod p is 8, so 8 divides p-1, meaning p ≡ 1 mod 8.

But wait, p could be 2 as well. Let me check that. For p=2, n⁴ +1. Let's see, n=1: 1 +1=2, which is divisible by 2 but not 4. n=2: 16 +1=17, which isn't divisible by 4. n=3: 81 +1=82, which is 2*41, not divisible by 4. n=0: 0 +1=1, which isn't divisible by 2. So p=2 doesn't work because n⁴ +1 is 2 mod 4 when n is odd, and 1 mod 4 when n is even. So 2 can't divide p² because 2²=4. So p=2 is out.

So the next primes are 17, 97, etc., but wait, are there smaller primes congruent to 1 mod 8? Let's list primes and see:

Primes: 2,3,5,7,11,13,17,19,23,29,31,37, etc.

Looking for primes ≡1 mod8. 17 is 1 mod8 (since 17=8*2 +1), then 97, 113, etc. But wait, 17 is the first prime after 2 that's 1 mod8. So perhaps p=17 is the minimal prime we're looking for.

Wait, but let me check p=5. Is there a prime p=5 such that 5²=25 divides n⁴ +1 for some n? Let's check n=2: 16 +1=17, not divisible by 5. n=3: 81 +1=82, 82/25=3.28, nope. n=4: 256 +1=257, which is prime, not divisible by 25. n=1: 2, nope. n=5: 625 +1=626, 626/25=25.04, so 25*25=625, 626 is 625 +1, so 626 mod25 is 1, not 0. So 5 doesn't work.

What about p=13? Let me check if 13²=169 divides n⁴ +1 for some n. Let me try n=5: 625+1=626, 626/169 is about 3.7, not integer. n=2: 16+1=17, nope. n=3: 81+1=82, nope. n=4: 256+1=257, nope. Maybe n=10: 10000 +1=10001. 10001 divided by 169: 169*59=9971, 10001-9971=30, so 10001 isn't divisible by 169. Hmm, maybe n=7: 7⁴=2401, 2401 +1=2402. 2402 divided by 169: 169*14=2366, 2402-2366=36, which isn't zero. So 13 doesn't seem to work either.

What about p=17? Let's see if 17²=289 divides n⁴ +1 for some n. So I need to find n such that n⁴ ≡ -1 mod 289. Let me try n=4. 4^4=256. 256 +1=257. 257 mod289 is 257, not 0. n=5: 625 +1=626. 626 mod289 is 626 -2*289=626-578=48≠0. n=6: 1296 +1=1297. 1297 mod289: Let's see, 289*4=1156. 1297-1156=141. Not zero. n=7: 7^4=2401. 2401 +1=2402. 2402 mod289: 289*8=2312, 2402-2312=90. Not zero. Hmm.

Wait, maybe I should use the fact that if p=17, then in mod17
