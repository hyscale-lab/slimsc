Okay, so I've got this geometry problem here. Let me try to figure it out step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll take it slow.

The problem is about triangle ABC. It says that the circumcenter is O and the incenter is I. They give me that IA is perpendicular to OI. The circumradius is 13, and the inradius is 6. I need to find AB multiplied by AC.

Hmm, let's jot down what I know:

- Triangle ABC with circumradius R = 13 and inradius r = 6.
- Circumcenter O and incenter I.
- IA ⊥ OI.
- Find AB * AC.

First, I remember that in a triangle, the circumradius R is related to the sides and the area. The formula for the circumradius is R = (a*b*c)/(4*Δ), where a, b, c are the sides and Δ is the area.

The inradius r is given by r = Δ/s, where s is the semiperimeter, s = (a + b + c)/2. So, since r is 6, that means Δ = 6s.

Also, I know that the distance between the incenter and circumcenter can be found using the formula OI² = R(R - 2r). Let me check that. Yes, Euler's formula says OI² = R² - 2Rr. Wait, is that correct? Let me think. Euler's formula in triangle geometry is indeed OI² = R(R - 2r). So with R =13, r=6, OI² =13*(13 -12)=13*1=13. So OI = sqrt(13).

Wait, hold on, OI squared is R(R - 2r), so 13*(13 - 12) = 13*1=13. So OI is sqrt(13).

But the problem states that IA is perpendicular to OI. So, vector IA is perpendicular to vector OI. Hmm, maybe coordinate geometry could help here. Alternatively, maybe some trigonometric relationships.

Let me recall that in triangle ABC, the inradius r is related to the distance from the incenter to the circumradius
