Okay, so I have this problem here. Let me read it again: Let ω not equal to 1 be a 13th root of unity. I need to find the remainder when the product from k=0 to 12 of (2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k}) is divided by 1000.

Hmm, roots of unity, products... I remember that roots of unity have special properties, especially when it comes to cyclotomic polynomials. Maybe that can help.

First, let's understand what ω is. Since ω is a 13th root of unity, ω^13 = 1, and ω ≠ 1. So ω is a primitive 13th root.

The product we're looking at is ∏_{k=0}^{12} (2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k}). Let me denote each term as f(k) = 2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k}.

I wonder if there's a way to factor this expression or relate it to some polynomial. Maybe if I can express f(k) in terms of ω^k, I can find a pattern or a product over all roots.

Let me factor f(k):

f(k) = 2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k}.

Wait, that looks a bit like a quadratic in ω^k. Let me set x = ω^k. Then f(k) becomes 2 - 2x + x^2.

So, f(k) = x^2 - 2x + 2. Hmm, that's a quadratic. Maybe I can factor this quadratic or find its roots.

Let me compute the discriminant: D = (-2)^2 - 4*1*2 = 4 - 8 = -4. So the roots are [2 ± sqrt(-4)] / 2 = [2 ± 2i]/2 = 1 ± i.

So, f(k) factors as (x - (1 + i))(x - (1 - i)). Therefore, f(k) = (ω^k - (1 + i))(ω^k - (1 - i)).

So, the product becomes ∏_{k=0}^{12} [(ω^k - (1 + i))(ω^k - (1 - i))]
