Okay, so Iâ€™ve got this geometry problem here about a convex equilateral hexagon. Let me try to visualize it first. The hexagon is convex and equilateral, which means all its sides are equal in length, but it's not necessarily regular because the angles can be different. Also, it's given that all pairs of opposite sides are parallel. Hmm, that's interesting. So, for example, AB is parallel to DE, BC is parallel to EF, and CD is parallel to FA.

The problem mentions a triangle formed by extending the sides AB, CD, and EF. The sides of this triangle are 200, 240, and 300. We need to find the side length of the hexagon.

Let me try to draw a rough sketch in my mind. Since the hexagon is convex and equilateral with opposite sides parallel, it must look somewhat like a regular hexagon but stretched or compressed in certain directions. The triangle formed by extending AB, CD, and EF is probably a larger triangle outside the hexagon.

I recall that in such hexagons, the sides can be thought of as vectors, and because of the opposite sides being parallel, the hexagon can be considered as a centrally symmetric figure. Wait, is that correct? Actually, in a regular hexagon, it's centrally symmetric, but in this case, since it's equilateral but not necessarily regular, it might not be symmetric. Or is it? Because the opposite sides are parallel, maybe it's still symmetric in some way.

But perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think about the properties of such hexagons. If all opposite sides are parallel, then the hexagon can be inscribed in a larger triangle, with each pair of sides extending to form the sides of this triangle. The triangle in question is formed by extending AB, CD, and EF.

Wait, so if AB, CD, and EF are extended, they meet at some points forming a triangle with sides 200, 240, 300. So, each side of this triangle is an extension of one of those sides.

Let me denote the triangle as T, with sides of length 200, 240, and 300. So, the sides of T are extensions of AB, CD, EF. Let me denote the points where these extensions meet as, say, P, Q, R where PQ=200, QR=240, and RP=300.

Now, since AB, CD, EF are sides of the hexagon, and the hexagon is convex and equilateral, each of these sides must be inside the triangle T. The hexagon is formed by connecting these sides in order, with each side parallel to its opposite.

I think the key here is to use similar triangles or some proportional relationships. Since the hexagon is equilateral, each side has the same length,
