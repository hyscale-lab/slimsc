Okay, so I have this problem about counting paths on an 8x8 grid. The paths go from the lower left corner to the upper right corner, and they have a length of 16. I need to find how many such paths change direction exactly four times. Hmm, let me try to break this down.

First, I remember that on a grid, moving from one corner to another typically involves moving right and up. In an 8x8 grid, to get from the lower left to the upper right, you need to move 8 steps to the right and 8 steps up, totaling 16 steps. So any path is a sequence of 8 rights (R) and 8 ups (U), arranged in some order.

Now, the number of such paths without any restrictions is the combination of 16 steps taken 8 at a time for rights (or ups), which is C(16,8). But this problem adds a restriction: the path must change direction exactly four times. So I can't just use that straightforward combination.

Changing direction exactly four times means that the path alternates between moving right and up exactly four times. Wait, but each direction change requires a switch from right to up or up to right. So each time the direction changes, it's a switch.

Let me think about what a path with exactly four direction changes looks like. If I start with a right move, the directions would go right, up, right, up, right, up, right, up. Wait, that's four changes, right? Because each switch is a change. Starting with R, then U is the first change, then R again is the second, U is third, R is fourth, U is fifth. Wait, but that would be five direction changes, because each switch is a new direction.

Wait, maybe I'm getting confused here. Let me clarify. Each time the path switches from R to U or U to R, that's one direction change. So if I start with R, then the first time I switch to U is the first change, then switching back to R is the second change, switching to U is the third, and switching back to R is the fourth change. So in this case, the path would have four direction changes and end with R. But wait, the final step has to be at the upper right corner, which is (8,8). So if I started with R, the last move must be U, right
