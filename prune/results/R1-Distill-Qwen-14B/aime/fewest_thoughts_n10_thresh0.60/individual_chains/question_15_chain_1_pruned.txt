Okay, so I've got this problem here about counting paths on an 8x8 grid. The paths go from the lower left corner to the upper right corner, and they have a length of 16. But the catch is that these paths can only change direction exactly four times. Hmm, I need to figure out how to calculate that.

First, let me make sure I understand the grid setup. An 8x8 grid has points where each side has 8 segments, right? So moving from the lower left to the upper right would require moving 8 steps to the right and 8 steps up, in some order. That makes sense because the grid has 9 points along each side, so moving from (0,0) to (8,8) requires 8 right and 8 up moves.

Now, the total number of such paths without any restrictions is the combination of 16 moves taken 8 at a time, which is C(16,8). But that's without any direction changes. Wait, no, actually, each time you switch from right to up or up to right, that's a direction change. So in the total number of paths, the number of direction changes can vary.

Wait, the question is about paths that change direction exactly four times. So I need to count the number of such paths with exactly four direction changes.

Let me think about what a direction change means. Each time the path switches from moving right to up or from up to right, that's one change. So, starting from the lower left, the first move is either right or up. Let's say it's right. Then, each time it changes direction, it alternates between right and up.

Wait, but maybe it's better to model this as a sequence of moves. Each path is a sequence of R's and U's, right? So for an 8x8 grid, the path will consist of 8 R's and 8 U's arranged in some order. The number of direction changes is the number of times the direction switches between R and U as you go through the sequence.

So, for example, the sequence RRRUUURURURU would have several direction changes. Let me count: R to U is one change, then U to R is another, R to U is three, U to R is four, R to U is five. So that's five direction changes. But we need exactly four direction changes.

So, how do I count the number of such sequences with exactly four direction changes?

I think the key is to model the number of runs of consecutive R's and U's. Each time the direction changes, a new run starts. So, if a path has exactly four direction changes, that means it has five runs. Because the number of direction changes is one less than the number of runs. For example, if you have two runs, like RRRUUU, that's one direction change. So, four direction changes mean five runs.

Each run must consist of at least one step, right? Because you can't have zero steps in a run. So, for our case, the path is divided into five runs, alternating between R and U. Since the path starts at the lower left corner, which is (0,0), the first move can be either R or U. But in an 8x8 grid, the total number of R's and U's must both be 8.

Wait, but depending on whether the first run is R or U, the number of runs for each direction will differ. Let's think about this.

If the first run is R, then the runs will alternate as R, U, R, U, R, U, R, U. Wait, but that's eight runs, which would mean seven direction changes. Hmm, but we need four direction changes, which implies five runs. So that must be a different scenario.

Wait, perhaps I need to clarify. If a path changes direction exactly four times, that means it has five runs. Each run is a consecutive sequence of R's or U's. So, the number of runs is direction_changes + 1.

So, for four direction changes, five runs. Now, how does this split between R and U runs?

If the first run is R, then the runs will be R, U, R, U, R. That's three R runs and two U runs. Alternatively, if the first run is U, then the runs are U, R, U, R, U, which is three U runs and two R runs. Wait, no, that can't be right. Let me count again.

Wait, five runs: if the first run is R, then the runs are R, U, R, U, R. So that's three R runs and two U runs. Similarly, if the first run is U, then the runs are U, R, U, R, U. So three U runs and two R runs.

So, in either case, the number of runs for each direction is either three R runs and two U runs, or three U runs and two R runs. But since the total number of R's and U's must each be eight, we can model this as partitioning the eight R's into three runs and the eight U's into two runs, or vice versa.

Wait, so let's formalize this. Suppose the first run is R. Then, the number of R runs is three, and the number of U runs is two. Each R run must have at least one R, and each U run must have at least one U. Similarly, if the first run is U, then U runs are three and R runs are two.

So, for the case where the first run is R, we have three R runs and two U runs. The number of ways to distribute the R's into three runs is the number of positive integer solutions to a + b + c = 8, which is C(8-1,3-1) = C(7,2) = 21. Similarly, for the U runs, which are two runs, the number is C(8-1,2-1) = C(7,1) = 7. So the total number of sequences starting with R and having exactly four direction changes is 21 * 7 = 147.

Similarly, if the first run is U, then we have three U runs and two R runs. The number of ways to distribute U's into three runs is C(7,2) = 21, and R's into two runs is C(7,1) = 7. So again, 21 * 7 = 147.

Adding both cases together, the total number of such paths would be 147 + 147 = 294.

Wait, but wait a second. Is that all? Let me double-check.

Each run must have at least one step, so using stars and bars, the number of ways to split 8 identical items into k runs is C(8-1, k-1) = C(7, k-1). So for R runs: if first run is R, then 3 runs of R, so C(7,2) = 21. Similarly, 2 runs of U: C(7,1) =7. So 21*7=147. Similarly for starting with U: 21*7=147. So total is 294.

But wait, let me think about the initial direction. Does
