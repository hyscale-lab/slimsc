Okay, so I have this problem about residents in Aimeville and the things they own. Let me try to make sense of it step by step.

First, the problem says there are 900 residents. Each resident owns a bag of candy hearts, so that's one thing everyone has. Then, there are three other items: diamond rings, golf clubs, and garden spades. The numbers are 195, 367, and 562 respectively. 

Wait, but not everyone owns all of them. Some own exactly two, and some own exactly three. The problem states that 437 residents own exactly two of these things, and 234 own exactly three. The question is, how many own all four? Hmm, since everyone has the candy hearts, the four items include that as well.

Let me think about how to model this. I remember something about the principle of inclusion-exclusion. Maybe that's the way to go here.

So, the principle of inclusion-exclusion for four sets would be:

Total = A + B + C + D - (sum of all pairwise intersections) + (sum of all triple intersections) - (the intersection of all four).

Wait, but in this case, D is the candy hearts, which everyone owns. So D is 900. That might simplify things.

Let me denote:
- A = number of residents owning diamond rings = 195
- B = number owning golf clubs = 367
- C = number owning garden spades = 562
- D = number owning candy hearts = 900 (since everyone has this)

Wait, but D is the same as the total number of residents, so D is 900. So, when we're talking about intersections, like A∩B∩C∩D, that's just A∩B∩C because everyone is in D.

Let me try to structure this. The inclusion-exclusion formula for four sets is:

|A ∪ B ∪ C ∪ D| = |A| + |B| + |C| + |D| - |A∩B| - |A∩C| - |A∩D| - |B∩C| - |B∩D| - |C∩D| + |A∩B∩C| + |A∩B∩D| + |A∩C∩D| +
