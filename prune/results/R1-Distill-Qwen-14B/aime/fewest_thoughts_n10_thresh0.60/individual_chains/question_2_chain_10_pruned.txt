Okay, so I have this geometry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me start by understanding the problem.

We have three points: O at (0,0), A at (1/2, 0), and B at (0, sqrt(3)/2). So, O is the origin, A is somewhere on the x-axis, and B is on the y-axis. I can imagine these points on a coordinate plane.

The family F consists of segments PQ of unit length. Each PQ is a segment in the first quadrant with P on the x-axis and Q on the y-axis. So, P has coordinates (p, 0) and Q has coordinates (0, q) where p and q are positive real numbers. Since PQ is of unit length, the distance between P and Q is 1. Using the distance formula, that means sqrt(p² + q²) = 1. So, p² + q² = 1.

Therefore, all such segments PQ lie on the line connecting (p,0) and (0,q) where p² + q² = 1. So, they are all line segments from the x-axis to the y-axis with length 1.

Now, the problem mentions that there's a unique point C on AB, distinct from A and B, that doesn't belong to any segment from F other than AB. So, AB is one of these segments in F, right? Let me check.

Point A is at (1/2, 0) and point B is at (0, sqrt(3)/2). Let me compute the distance between A and B. The distance would be sqrt[(1/2)^2 + (sqrt(3)/2)^2] = sqrt[1/4 + 3/4] = sqrt[1] = 1. So AB is indeed a segment of length 1, so AB is in F.

So, AB is one of these segments, and point C is on AB but not on any other segment from F. So, the task is to find point C on AB (excluding A and B) such that it's not on any other PQ in F.

Once I find point C, I need to compute OC², which is the square of the distance from the origin to point C. Then express it as a fraction p/q where p and q are coprime, and find p+q.

Alright, so I need to find the point C on AB that is not on any other segment PQ from F except AB. So, how can I approach this?

First, let me parametrize point C on AB. Since AB goes from A(1/2, 0) to B(0, sqrt(3)/2), I can write the parametric equations for AB.

Let me parameterize AB as a line segment. Let me use a parameter t, where t ranges from 0 to 1. When t=0, we're at A, and when t=1, we're at B.

So, the coordinates of a general point C on AB can be written as:

x-coordinate: (1/2) * (1 - t) + 0 * t = (1/2)(1 - t)
y-coordinate: 0 * (1 - t) + (sqrt(3)/2) * t = (sqrt(3)/2) t

So, point C is ((1/2)(1 - t), (sqrt(3)/2) t) for some t between 0 and 1.

Alternatively, I can write this as:

x = (1/2)(1 - t)
y = (sqrt(3)/2) t

So, if I solve for t in terms of x: t = 1 - 2x

Then, substituting into y: y = (sqrt(3)/2)(1 - 2x)

So, the equation of line AB is y = (sqrt(3)/2)(1 - 2x). Let me confirm that when x=1/2, y=0, which is point A, and when x=0, y=sqrt(3)/2, which is point B. Yes, that looks correct.

Now, for any other segment PQ in F, which connects a point P(p, 0) to Q(0, q), with p² + q² = 1, we can write the equation of PQ. The equation of PQ is x/p + y/q = 1.

So, any PQ in F is given by x/p + y/q = 1, with p² + q² = 1.

We need to find the point C on AB that doesn't lie on any other PQ except AB itself.

So, if C is on AB, it's on AB's equation y = (sqrt(3)/2)(1 - 2x). For C not to lie on any other PQ, the system of equations:

y = (sqrt(3)/2)(1 - 2x)
x/p + y/q = 1

must have no solution for any other p and q except when PQ is AB.

Wait, but since AB is one of the PQs, then the point C could lie on AB and another PQ, unless C is such that the only PQ passing through it is AB. So, we need to find C on AB that is not on any other PQ in F.

So, perhaps C is the point where AB is tangent to some envelope of the family F. Hmm, the envelope of all such segments PQ might form a curve. The point C would be the point where AB is tangent to this envelope.

Alternatively, perhaps the point C is where the envelope of F touches AB.

So, the envelope of a family of curves is a curve that is tangent to each member of the family at some point. In this case, the family F is all segments PQ with P on x-axis, Q on y-axis, and PQ of unit length.

So, maybe the envelope of F is a curve, and AB is tangent to this envelope at point C.

Therefore, point C is the point where AB is tangent to the envelope of F.

So, I need to find the envelope of the family F, then find where AB is tangent to it, and
