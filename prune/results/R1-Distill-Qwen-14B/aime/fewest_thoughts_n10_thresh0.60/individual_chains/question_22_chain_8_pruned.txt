Okay, so I've got this geometry problem here about a convex equilateral hexagon. All the sides are equal, and each pair of opposite sides is parallel. The problem mentions a triangle formed by extending the sides AB, CD, and EF, and the lengths of the sides of this triangle are 200, 240, and 300. I need to find the side length of the hexagon.

Hmm, alright, let me try to visualize this. A convex equilateral hexagon with opposite sides parallel. That must mean it's a regular-like hexagon but maybe not exactly regular because the sides are equal, but the angles might not be. Wait, no, in a regular hexagon, all sides are equal and all angles are equal, but here it just says equilateral, so maybe only the sides are equal, and the angles can vary, but opposite sides are parallel. Interesting.

So, the hexagon is labeled ABCDEF, so the sides are AB, BC, CD, DE, EF, and FA. Since it's convex, all the internal angles are less than 180 degrees. Now, each pair of opposite sides is parallel. So, AB is parallel to DE, BC is parallel to EF, and CD is parallel to FA.

The problem says that when we extend the sides AB, CD, and EF, they form a triangle with sides 200, 240, and 300. So, AB, CD, EF are sides of the hexagon; they are each of length 's', which is what we're trying to find.

Wait, when they say the triangle is formed by the extensions of AB, CD, and EF, I think that means that each of these sides, when extended beyond their endpoints, will meet at some points forming a triangle. So, AB is extended beyond A and B, CD is extended beyond C and D, and EF is extended beyond E and F. The intersections of these extensions form the triangle.

I think this triangle is called the "outer triangle" of the hexagon. The sides of this outer triangle are 200, 240, and 300.

I need to relate the side length 's' of the hexagon to these outer triangle sides.

I remember that in such hexagons, especially when opposite sides are parallel, they might be related to a concept called a "prismatic" hexagon or something similar, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe it's similar to a translation of a triangle, where each side is translated by some vectors, but I'm not certain.

Wait, another approach: since all opposite sides are parallel, perhaps the hexagon can be thought of as formed by three pairs of parallel lines. Each pair is separated by some distance, and each side of the outer triangle is related to these distances.

Let me think about the triangle formed by the extensions. Let's denote the
