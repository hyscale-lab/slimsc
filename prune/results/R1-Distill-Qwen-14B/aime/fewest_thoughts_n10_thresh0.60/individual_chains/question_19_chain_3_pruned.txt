Okay, so I have this geometry problem here. Let me try to parse it step by step.

We have triangle ABC with circumcenter O and incenter I. The problem states that IA is perpendicular to OI. The circumradius is 13, and the inradius is 6. We need to find AB multiplied by AC, which is AB·AC.

Alright, let's jot down what we know:

1. Triangle ABC.
2. O is the circumcenter, so it's the intersection point of the perpendicular bisectors of the triangle.
3. I is the incenter, the intersection of the angle bisectors.
4. IA is perpendicular to OI. So, vector IA is perpendicular to vector OI.
5. Circumradius R = 13.
6. Inradius r = 6.
7. Need to find AB·AC.

Hmm, okay. First, let's recall some formulas related to triangle centers and radii.

The circumradius R is given by the formula R = (a)/(2 sin A), where a is the length of side BC, and angle A is opposite BC.

The inradius r is given by r = Δ/s, where Δ is the area of the triangle and s is the semiperimeter.

But I'm not sure yet how to connect IA being perpendicular to OI. Maybe I should find some relations involving vectors or coordinate geometry?

Wait, perhaps I can use coordinate geometry here. Let me try setting up a coordinate system.

Let me place the circumcenter O at the origin (0,0). Since O is the circumcenter, all the vertices of the triangle lie on the circle of radius 13 centered at O.

Now, the incenter I has coordinates (x, y), but I don't know where exactly. But I know that IA is perpendicular to OI.

Wait, IA is the line from I to A, and OI is the line from O to I. So, the vectors IA and OI are perpendicular. So, their dot product should be zero.

Let me denote vector OI as (x, y) because I is at (x, y) and O is at (0,0). Vector IA would be A - I, where A is a point on the circumcircle, so A has coordinates (a, b) such that a² + b² = 13² = 169.

So, vector IA = (a - x, b - y).

Vector OI is (x, y). The dot product of IA and OI should be zero:

(a - x)x + (b - y)y = 0.

Expanding this: a x - x² + b y - y² = 0.

So, a x + b y = x² + y².

I can note that x² + y² is the square of the distance from O to I, which is the length OI. Let's call OI = d, so d² = x² + y².

So, the equation becomes a x + b y = d².

Hmm, not sure yet. Maybe I need more relations.

I also know that the inradius r = 6. The formula for the inradius is r = Δ/s, where Δ is the area and s is the semiperimeter.

Another formula involving inradius is the distance between the incenter and circumcenter: OI² = R(R - 2r). Wait, is that correct? Let me recall.

Wait, Euler's formula in triangle geometry states that the distance between the incenter and circumcenter is OI² = R(R - 2r). So, plugging in R=13 and r=6:

OI² = 13*(13 - 12) = 13*1 = 13. So, OI = sqrt(13).

Therefore, d² = 13, so d = sqrt(13).

So, x² + y² = 13.

So, going back to the equation from the dot product:

a x +
