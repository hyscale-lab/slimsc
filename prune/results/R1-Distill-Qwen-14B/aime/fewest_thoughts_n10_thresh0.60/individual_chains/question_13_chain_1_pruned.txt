Okay, so I have this math problem about Aya's walking and coffee shop stops. Hmm, let me read it again carefully.

Every morning, Aya walks 9 kilometers and then stops at a coffee shop. When she walks at a constant speed of s km/h, the entire walk takes her 4 hours, which includes t minutes she spends in the coffee shop. When she increases her speed to s + 2 km/h, the walk takes her 2 hours and 24 minutes, again including t minutes in the coffee shop. Now, I need to find out how many minutes her walk takes when she walks at s + 1/2 km/h, including the t minutes in the coffee shop.

Alright, so let's break this down. First, I think I can model the time she spends walking without the coffee stop, and then add the coffee time t. But wait, the problem says the total time includes t minutes, so the walking time plus t is given. So, let me try to write equations based on that.

When Aya walks at speed s km/h, the total time is 4 hours. But 4 hours includes both the time she spends walking and the time t she spends in the coffee shop. Similarly, at speed s + 2 km/h, the total time is 2 hours and 24 minutes, which is 2.4 hours because 24 minutes is 0.4 hours.

Wait, let me convert 2 hours and 24 minutes entirely into hours. 24 minutes is 24/60 = 0.4 hours, so the total time is 2.4 hours. So, the total time at speed s is 4 hours, and at speed s + 2 is 2.4 hours.

But wait, the problem says "the walk takes her 4 hours, including t minutes...", which actually means the time she spends walking plus t minutes equals 4 hours. Wait, no, that's not correct. Let me think again. If she walks for a certain time, and then stops for t minutes, the total time from start to finish is 4 hours. So, the walking time plus t minutes equals 4 hours.

So, in terms of hours, the walking time is 4 hours minus t minutes. But wait, t is in minutes, so I should convert it to hours. Let me denote t as t minutes, which is t/60 hours. So
