Okay, so I have this problem here about placing chips on a 5x5 grid. Let me read through it again and try to understand what's being asked.

We have 25 white chips and 25 black chips, but they're indistinguishable. So all white chips are the same, and all black ones are the same. The grid has 25 unit cells, and each cell can hold at most one chip. 

The conditions are:
1. Each cell can have at most one chip. So no two chips in the same cell.
2. All chips in the same row must be the same color, and all chips in the same column must be the same color. So if I place a white chip in a row, every chip in that row, if any, must be white. Similarly for columns.
3. Any additional chip placed would violate one or more of the previous two conditions. So the placement is maximal; we can't add any more chips without breaking the rules.

I need to find the number of ways to place some of these chips under these constraints.

Hmm, okay. Let me try to break this down.

First, since each row must have all chips of the same color, each row can be either all white, all black, or have no chips. Wait, no, because you can have a row with no chips. Wait, but actually, each row can be either all white, all black, or empty. Similarly for each column.

But wait, if a row is empty, then any column that has a chip can't have that row interfere. Hmm, but the column condition is that all chips in the same column must be the same color. So columns can be all white, all black, or empty.

Wait, but the problem says that each cell can contain at most one chip, and the placement is such that any additional chip would violate the conditions. So this is a maximal arrangement. That means that in every row and every column, either the row is full (all white or all black) or the column is full.

Wait, no. Because if a row is not full, then perhaps it's because the column constraints are preventing it from being filled further. Hmm, maybe I should model this as a matrix where each cell is either white, black, or empty, but with the constraints that in any row, all non-empty cells are the same color, and in any column, all non-empty cells are the same color.

Alternatively, perhaps I can model the grid as a bipartite graph, where one partition is the rows and the other is the columns. Each cell is an edge, and the color is determined by the row and column.

Wait, actually, maybe each row is assigned a color (white, black, or empty), and each column is assigned a color (white, black, or empty). But then, the intersection of a row and a column can only have a chip if the row and column colors match. Because if row i is white and column j is white, then the cell (i,j) can have a white chip. But if row i is white and column j is black, then cell (i,j) cannot have a chip because it's conflicting.

Wait, but each cell can only have at most one chip. So, the color of the cell (i,j) is determined by the color assigned to row i and column j. If both are white, then cell (i,j) is white. If row is white and column is black, no chip. If both are black, then cell (i,j) is black. If both are empty, then no chip.

But wait, the colors assigned to rows and columns can't be arbitrary. Because if a row is assigned white, then all the cells in that row which are in columns assigned white must have white chips, but you can't have any cells in that row assigned to columns assigned black, because that would be conflicting.

Wait, maybe the assignment is such that for each row, the row is either white, black, or empty. Similarly for each column. But if a row is white, then all the cells in that row must be white or empty. But that's not the case because the column might have a different color constraint.

Wait, perhaps each row can be either white, black, or empty, and each column can be white, black, or empty. Then, for each cell (i,j), if row i is color A and column j is color B, then cell (i,j) will have a chip of color A if A is not empty and A equals B. Wait, no, that doesn't make sense because if row i is white and column j is black, then cell (i,j) can't have a chip because neither the row nor the column allows it. Hmm, maybe I'm complicating this.

Alternatively, perhaps the grid must be such that all white chips form a rectangle and all black chips form another rectangle. Because if all the white chips are in certain rows and certain columns, then those rows and columns are fully occupied by white chips. Similarly for black.

Wait, let me think: if a row has any white chips, then all chips in that row must be white. Similarly, if a column has any white chips, then all chips in that column must be white. So the white chips must form a rectangle covering entire rows and entire columns. The same goes for black chips.

Wait, that makes sense. So the white chips must form a rectangle, say, covering R rows and C columns, and the black chips must form another rectangle, possibly overlapping or not. But the problem is that all the white and black regions can't overlap because each cell can have at most one chip.

Wait, but the problem says that each cell can have at most one chip. So the white and black regions must be disjoint.

So, the grid is divided into two rectangles: one for white and one for black. These rectangles can't overlap, meaning they are either completely separate or one is entirely contained within the other, but in such a way that their intersection is zero. Wait, but if one is inside the other, then the overlapping cells would have both white and black chips, which is not allowed. So they must be completely disjoint.

Wait, but perhaps they can be in different parts of the grid. So the white rectangle is in some rows and columns, and the black rectangle is in the remaining rows and columns.

Wait, but each row can have at most one color, and each column can have at most one color. So, for example, if rows 1-2 are white, and columns 1-3 are white, then the white chips form a 2x3 rectangle. Similarly, if rows 3-5 are black, and columns 4-5 are black, that forms a 3x2 rectangle. But then, the black rectangle's rows and columns don't overlap with the white's. Wait, but in this case, the white rectangle uses rows 1-2 and columns 1-3, and the black rectangle uses rows 3-5 and columns 4-5. So the rows 3-5 and columns 4-5 are all black. But what about the cells in rows 3-5 and columns 1-3? Are they empty? Because the black rectangle doesn't cover those. So in this case, those cells would be empty.

But in this case, the white and black regions are in separate parts of the grid, and the rest is empty. So perhaps the arrangement is that the grid is divided into white and black rectangles that don't overlap, and the rest is empty.

But wait, the problem says that any additional chip would violate the conditions. So in this case, we can't add any more chips without violating the color constraints. So, the arrangement must be such that every row is either entirely white, entirely black, or entirely empty, and every column is either entirely white, entirely black, or entirely empty. Because if a row isn't entirely white or black, but has some empty cells, then you could potentially add a chip in that row, but that would require the column to also be the same color, which might not be the case.

Wait, so perhaps the arrangement must be such that all non-empty rows and columns are fully occupied by a single color. So, any row that has at least one chip must have all its cells filled with the same color. Similarly for columns. Therefore, the grid is partitioned into white and black rectangles, each covering entire rows and columns.

Wait, that makes sense. So for example, some rows are assigned to white, some to black, and some to empty. Similarly for columns. But the intersection of a white row and a black column would be empty, as would the intersection of a black row and a white column. The intersection of a white row and white column would be white, and similarly for black.

Wait, but if a row is white, then all the cells in that row must be white, unless the column is black, in which case the cell is empty. Similarly, if a column is black, all cells in that column must be black unless the row is white, in which case the cell is empty.

But wait, that's getting a bit confusing. Maybe it's better to model this as the grid being divided into four regions:

1. Rows assigned to white and columns assigned to white: these cells are white.

2. Rows assigned to white and columns assigned to black: these cells are empty.

3. Rows assigned to black and columns assigned to white: these cells are empty.

4. Rows assigned to black and columns assigned to black: these cells are black.

So the grid is a 5x5 grid, and we assign each row to be either white, black, or empty. Similarly, each column is assigned to be white, black, or empty. But with the constraint that if a row is assigned white, then all columns assigned white must have white chips in those cells, and all columns assigned black must have empty in those cells. Similarly for black rows.

Wait, but actually, the assignments of rows and columns can't conflict. For example, if a row is assigned white, then any column that is assigned white must have that cell filled with a white chip. So, if a column is assigned white, then all the cells in that column must be white, unless the corresponding row is assigned black or empty.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is to model this as a bipartite graph where one set is the rows and the other is the columns. Each row can be connected to a column if they are both assigned the same color. Then the white region is the union of white rows and white columns, and similarly for black.

But I'm getting a bit stuck here. Maybe I should think in terms of choosing which rows and columns are white and black, ensuring that their intersections are consistent.

Wait, another thought: the entire grid can be partitioned into four regions based on the color assignments of the rows and columns. Let me define:

- Let W_r be the set of rows assigned white.
- Let B_r be the set of rows assigned black.
- Let W_c be the set of columns assigned white.
- Let B_c be the set of columns assigned black.

Then, the cell (i,j) is white if i is in W_r and j is in W_c. It's black if i is in B_r and j is in B_c. If i is in W_r and j in B_c, then the cell is empty. Similarly, if i in B_r and j in W_c, the cell is empty. If i not in W_r or B_r, or j not in W_c or B_c, then the cell is empty.

Wait, but each row must be assigned to exactly one color (white, black, or empty), and same for each column. So W_r, B_r, and the empty rows form a partition of the 5 rows. Similarly for columns.

Wait, but the empty rows and columns can be considered as neither white nor black. So, the assignment is that for each row, it's either white, black, or empty. Similarly for columns.

But for the cells, if a row is white and a column is white, then the cell is white. If a row is white and a column is black, then cell is empty. If a row is black and column is white, cell is empty. If row is black and column is black, cell is black.

In this way, the grid is divided into four regions: white-white (white), white-black (empty), black-white (empty), black-black (black). So the only non-empty cells are in the white-white and black-black intersections.

But then, in this case, the white region is a rectangle defined by W_r and W_c, and the black region is a rectangle defined by B_r and B_c. These two rectangles cannot overlap because if they did, that cell would have to be both white and black, which is impossible.

Wait, but W_r and B_r are disjoint, as are W_c and B_c. So, the white region is W_r × W_c, and the black region is B_r × B_c. These two regions are disjoint because if i is in W_r, it's not in B_r, and same for columns. So their intersection is empty.

That makes sense. So, the grid is split into four regions, two of which (white-white and black-black) are non-empty, each being a rectangle.

But then, the problem states that we have exactly 25 white and 25 black chips. Wait, no: the problem says we have 25 white and 25 black chips available, but we can place some of them. So the total number of chips placed can be up to 50, but in this case, since the grid is 5x5, we can place up to 25 chips.

Wait, no, the grid has 25 cells, so the maximum number of chips is 25. But the problem gives us 25 white and 25 black chips, so we can choose to place any number of chips, but each placed chip must satisfy the color constraints, and the placement must be maximal, meaning we can't add any more chips without violating the conditions.

Wait, but in the scenario where we have white and black regions as rectangles, the total number of chips is |W_r| × |W_c| + |B_r| × |B_c|. And this has to be less than or equal to 25, since the grid only has 25 cells.

But the problem allows us to use any number of white and black chips, as long as we don't exceed the available 25 each. But since the grid can only hold up to 25 chips, the sum of white and black chips placed must be <=25.

But the problem says that we have 25 white and 25 black chips. So, this is just the supply. The number of chips placed can be any number up to 25, but the placement must be maximal, meaning that you can't add any more chips without violating the conditions.

Hmm, perhaps the arrangement is such that every row and column is either entirely white, entirely black, or entirely empty. Because if a row isn't entirely white or black, you could potentially add a chip, but that would require the column to also be that color, which might not be the case.

Wait, that's a key point. If a row isn't filled with a single color, then it's possible that some cells in that row could be filled, but that would require all the columns those cells are in to be of that color as well. So, perhaps the only way to make the arrangement maximal is to have all non-empty rows and columns fully filled with a single color.

So, in other words, the white chips must form a rectangle covering entire rows and entire columns, and the black chips must form another rectangle, possibly overlapping, but such that the total number of cells is such that you can't add any more chips without violating the conditions.

Wait, but if we have a white rectangle and a black rectangle, their intersection must be empty. So, for example, if the white rectangle covers rows 1-2 and columns 1-3, then the black rectangle can't cover any of those rows or columns. So it would have to cover rows 3-5 and columns 4-5, perhaps.

But then, the total number of white chips is 2x3=6, and black chips is 3x2=6, total 12. But we have 25 white and 25 black available, so we can have more.

Wait, maybe another approach: each row can be either white, black, or empty. Similarly for each column. The color assignments must be such that the white and black regions don't overlap, and that the arrangement is maximal.

Wait, perhaps the key is that the set of white rows and white columns must form a rectangle, and the set of black rows and black columns must form another rectangle, and these two rectangles are disjoint.

But each row can only be assigned to one color or empty, same for columns. So, for example, if I choose some rows to be white, some to be black, and the rest empty, and similarly for columns, then the white region is the intersection of white rows and white columns, and the black region is the intersection of black rows and black columns. These two regions must not overlap, so their row sets and column sets must be disjoint.

Wait, let me define:

Let W_r be the set of rows assigned white.

Let B_r be the set of rows assigned black.

Similarly, W_c for columns assigned white, B_c for columns assigned black.

Then, the white region is W_r × W_c, and the black region is B_r × B_c.

Since these regions must be disjoint, the intersection (W_r × W_c) ∩ (B_r × B_c) must be empty. Which implies that W_r ∩ B_r is empty and W_c ∩ B_c is empty. So, W_r and B_r are disjoint, as are W_c and B_c.

But since each row must be assigned to exactly one of white, black, or empty, the sets W_r, B_r, and E_r (empty rows) form a partition of the 5 rows. Similarly for columns: W_c, B_c, E_c partition the 5 columns.

So, in this case, the arrangement is determined by choosing subsets W_r, B_r, W_c, B_c such that W_r ∩ B_r = ∅, W_c ∩ B_c = ∅, and then the white region is W_r × W_c, the black region is B_r × B_c, and the rest are empty.

But since each row is assigned to exactly one color or empty, and same for columns, we can model this as a 3x3 matrix for rows (white, black, empty) and similarly for columns.

Wait, but perhaps the problem can be approached by considering that the grid must be a union of two rectangles: one white and one black, each covering entire rows and columns, and not overlapping.

So, the number of such arrangements is equal to the number of ways to choose W_r, B_r, W_c, B_c such that W_r and B_r are disjoint, W_c and B_c are disjoint, and E_r = all rows not in W_r or B_r, same for E_c.

But each row and column must be assigned to exactly one of white, black, or empty.

Now, the key point is that the arrangement must be maximal. That is, you can't add any more chips. So, for every empty cell (i,j), at least one of row i or column j must be assigned to a color different from the color of that cell. Wait, but in our model, if row i is empty and column j is empty, then cell (i,j) is empty, and you can't assign a color to it because both row and column are empty. But if row i is in W_r and column j is in B_c, then cell (i,j) is empty, and you can't place a chip there because row i is white and column j is black, so you can't have a white chip in column j or a black chip in row i.

Wait, but in our model, each cell is either white, black, or empty. So, to be maximal, any empty cell must have at least one of its row or column assigned to a color that would prevent placing a chip there.

Wait, let me think. For the arrangement to be maximal, every empty cell (i,j) must satisfy that either row i is not white (so if I tried to place a white chip, the row is not all white) or column j is not white (so can't place a white chip without violating column constraints). Similarly, either row i is not black or column j is not black.

Wait, no. Because if row i is not assigned to any color (i.e., it's empty), then you could potentially assign it to a color, but that would require all the columns in that row to be of that color, which might not be possible because some columns are already assigned to other colors.

But the condition is that the arrangement is maximal, meaning you can't add any more chips without violating the conditions.

So, for each empty cell, either its row is already assigned to a color, or its column is assigned to a color, such that placing a chip there would violate the constraints.

Wait, perhaps more precisely, for each empty cell (i,j), either row i is assigned to a color different from what you would place in (i,j), or column j is assigned to a color different from what you would place in (i,j).

Wait, but I'm getting a bit stuck here. Maybe I should think about the problem differently.

Let me consider that in order for the arrangement to be maximal, every row and every column that is not entirely filled must have at least one cell that is empty and cannot be filled without violating the constraints.

But in our initial model, where the grid is divided into white and black rectangles, the rest being empty, the arrangement is maximal because any empty cell is either in a row that's already assigned to a different color or a column that's assigned to a different color.

So, in this model, the arrangement is maximal because any cell not in the white or black regions is empty, and you can't add a chip there without changing the color of the row or column, which would require all other cells in that row or column to be of that color, potentially conflicting with existing assignments.

Therefore, the maximal arrangements are exactly those where the grid is divided into white and black rectangles, each covering entire rows and columns, with no overlap. The rest are empty.

So, the problem reduces to counting the number of ways to choose W_r, B_r, W_c, B_c such that:

- W_r ∩ B_r = ∅, W_c ∩ B_c = ∅.

- The white region is W_r × W_c, the black region is B_r × B_c.

- The total number of white chips is |W_r| × |W_c| ≤ 25, and the number of black chips is |B_r| × |B_c| ≤25.

But since we have 25 white and 25 black chips available, but we can use any number up to that, the constraints are automatically satisfied as long as |W_r| × |W_c| + |B_r| × |B_c| ≤25.

Wait, but actually, the problem says we have 25 white and 25 black chips, but we can place any number of them as long as we don't exceed 25 in total on the grid. So, the sum |W_r| × |W_c| + |B_r| × |B_c| can be up to 25.

But in our model, each arrangement is determined by choosing W_r, B_r, W_c, B_c, with W_r ∩ B_r = ∅ and W_c ∩ B_c = ∅, and the rest are empty.

So, to count the number of such arrangements, we can consider all possible ways to partition the rows into W_r, B_r, E_r (empty rows), and similarly for columns into W_c, B_c, E_c, such that W_r and B_r are disjoint, and W_c and B_c are disjoint.

But each row can be in exactly one of W_r, B_r, or E_r, same for columns. So, the number of ways to assign rows is 3^5, since each of the 5 rows has 3 choices. Similarly, 3^5 for columns. But we have constraints that W_r and B_r are disjoint, and same for columns. So, actually, the assignment for rows is the number of ways to assign each row to W_r, B_r, or E_r, with W_r and B_r being disjoint. Similarly for columns.

Wait, but the assignments for rows and columns are independent. So the total number of assignments is (number of row assignments) × (number of column assignments).

The number of row assignments is the number of ways to assign each row to W_r, B_r, or E_r, such that W_r ∩ B_r = ∅. That is, for each row, it can be in W_r, B_r, or E_r, but not both W_r and B_r.

Wait, no. Each row must be assigned to exactly one of W_r, B_r, or E_r. So for each row, 3 choices, and since the assignments are independent, it's 3^5.

Similarly for columns, 3^5.

So, the total number is 3^5 × 3^5 = 3^10 = 59049. But that's way too high because many of these assignments would result in overlapping white and black regions, which is not allowed.

Wait, no. Because in our model, the white region is W_r × W_c, and the black region is B_r × B_c. So, as long as W_r and B_r are disjoint, and W_c and B_c are disjoint, the white and black regions won't overlap. So, that means that the assignments for rows and columns can be any possible assignments where each row is in exactly one of W_r, B_r, E_r, and same for columns. But the problem is that when you assign rows and columns, the white and black regions might not fit into the grid without overlapping. Wait, no, because W_r and B_r are disjoint, and same for W_c and B_c, so their cross products will also be disjoint.

But wait, in this model, we don't care about the chips being placed, just the assignment of rows and columns. But the problem requires that the number of white and black chips placed does not exceed 25 each, but since the grid can hold up to 25 chips, the sum |W_r|×|W_c| + |B_r|×|B_c| must be ≤25.

Wait, but the problem allows us to use any number of chips as long as we don't exceed the 25 available. So, no, the sum could be up to 25, but in our model, it's possible that the sum exceeds 25, which would be impossible because the grid only has 25 cells.

Wait, but in our model, the white and black regions are W_r × W_c and B_r × B_c, which are disjoint, so their sizes add up to |W_r|×|W_c| + |B_r|×|B_c|. So, this must be ≤25.

Wait, but I think my initial approach is overcomplicating things. Let me try to think differently.

The problem requires that the arrangement is maximal, meaning that you can't add any more chips without violating the constraints. So, for every empty cell, either its row is already assigned to a color, or its column is assigned to a color, such that placing a chip of any color would violate the row or column constraints.

Wait, perhaps that means that every empty cell must have either its row fully assigned to a color (so adding a chip of a different color would violate the row constraint) or its column fully assigned to a color (so adding a chip of a different color would violate the column constraint).

In that case, the arrangement is maximal if for every empty cell (i,j), either row i is entirely white or black, or column j is entirely white or black.

So, the arrangement must cover the entire grid with white and black regions, such that any empty cell is in a row that's entirely white or black, or a column that's entirely white or black.

Wait, but that's not quite right. For example, if a row is entirely white, then all cells in that row must be white, so no empty cells in that row. Similarly, if a column is entirely white, all cells in that column must be white, so no empty cells in that column.

Wait, that suggests that the empty cells can only occur where both the row and the column are not entirely assigned to any color. So, for the arrangement to be maximal, every empty cell must be in a row that's not entirely white or black, and a column that's not entirely white or black. Because if either the row or the column is entirely white or black, then the cell can't be empty; it must be filled with that color.

Wait, that makes sense. So, the only empty cells are those where the row is neither entirely white nor black, and the column is neither entirely white nor black.

So, the arrangement must cover all cells except those in rows that are neither white nor black and columns that are neither white nor black. So, the empty cells form a rectangle where the rows are neither white nor black, and the columns are neither white nor black.

Wait, no. Because if a row is neither white nor black, then all cells in that row are empty, regardless of the column assignments. Similarly, if a column is neither white nor black, all cells in that column are empty, regardless of the row assignments.

Wait, perhaps it's better to model the grid as follows:

- Some rows are assigned to white: W_r.

- Some rows are assigned to black: B_r.

- The remaining rows are empty: E_r.

Similarly for columns:

- W_c: white columns.

- B_c: black columns.

- E_c: empty columns.

Then, the white region is W_r × W_c.

The black region is B_r × B_c.

The empty regions are E_r × E_c, E_r × (W_c ∪ B_c), (W_r ∪ B_r) × E_c.

Wait, but if a row is in E_r, then all cells in that row are empty, regardless of the column. Similarly, if a column is in E_c, all cells in that column are empty, regardless of the row.

So, the grid is divided into four regions:

1. W_r × W_c: white chips.

2. B_r × B_c: black chips.

3. E_r × (W_c ∪ B_c): empty because the row is empty.

4. (W_r ∪ B_r) × E_c: empty because the column is empty.

5. E_r × E_c: empty because both row and column are empty.

Wait, but in this model, the arrangement is determined by choosing W_r, B_r, W_c, B_c, E_r, E_c, such that W_r ∩ B_r = ∅, W_c ∩ B_c = ∅, and E_r = all rows not in W_r ∪ B_r, same for E_c.

But for the arrangement to be maximal, every empty cell must satisfy that either its row is in E_r, or its column is in E_c, or the row is in W_r ∪ B_r and the column is in W_c ∪ B_c, but the cell is not in W_r × W_c or B_r × B_c.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think again.

If a cell is empty, it must be because either its row is empty (E_r) or its column is empty (E_c), or the row is assigned to a color, but the column is assigned to a different color, making the cell empty.

But for the arrangement to be maximal, any empty cell must be such that you can't place a chip there without violating the row or column constraints.

So, if I have a cell (i,j) empty, then:

- If row i is in W_r, then column j must be in B_c or E_c. Because if column j were in W_c, then cell (i,j) would be white.

- Similarly, if row i is in B_r, then column j must be in W_c or E_c.

- If column j is in W_c, then row i must be in B_r or E_r.

- If column j is in B_c, then row i must be in W_r or E_r.

- If row i is in E_r or column j is in E_c, then cell (i,j) is empty.

So, in other words, the empty cells are those where:

Either row i is in E_r, or column j is in E_c, or row i is in W_r and column j is in B_c, or row i is in B_r and column j is in W_c.

Therefore, the arrangement is determined by choosing W_r, B_r, W_c, B_c, E_r, E_c, with the conditions:

- W_r ∩ B_r = ∅, W_c ∩ B_c = ∅.

- E_r = all rows not in W_r ∪ B_r.

- E_c = all columns not in W_c ∪ B_c.

And the empty cells are:

E_r × (W_c ∪ B_c) ∪ (W_r ∪ B_r) × E_c ∪ (W_r × B_c ∪ B_r × W_c).

Wait, but I'm not sure. Maybe the key is to realize that the arrangement must be such that the white and black regions are rectangles that don't overlap, and the rest are empty.

So, the number of such arrangements is equal to the number of ways to choose W_r, B_r, W_c, B_c such that W_r and B_r are disjoint, W_c and B_c are disjoint, and the white and black regions don't overlap.

But how do we count this?

Let me think about it as a bipartite graph between rows and columns. Each row can be connected to a column only if they are both assigned to the same color. Otherwise, the cell is empty.

Wait, maybe it's better to model this as a matrix where each cell is either white, black, or empty. The constraints are:

1. All white cells in a row must be the same.

2. All black cells in a row must be the same.

Wait, no. Because a row can't have both white and black cells. So, each row must be all white, all black, or all empty.

Similarly, each column must be all white, all black, or all empty.

So, this reduces the problem to assigning each row to a color (white, black, empty), and each column to a color (white, black, empty), such that:

- If a row is white, then all columns in that row must be white or empty.

- If a column is white, then all rows in that column must be white or empty.

Similarly for black.

Wait, but this is getting a bit tangled. Maybe it's better to think that each row and column is assigned a color (white, black, empty), and the cell (i,j) is white if row i and column j are both white, black if both are black, and empty otherwise.

But in this case, the arrangement is maximal if every empty cell is such that either its row or column is not white or black.

Wait, no. Because if a row is white, then all cells in that row must be white or empty, but if the column is black, then the cell is empty. So the arrangement is such that the white and black regions are rectangles, and the rest are empty.

So, the number of such arrangements is equal to the number of ways to choose subsets W_r, B_r of the rows, and W_c, B_c of the columns, such that W_r ∩ B_r = ∅, W_c ∩ B_c = ∅, and then the white region is W_r × W_c, the black region is B_r × B_c, and the rest are empty.

But each row can be in W_r, B_r, or neither, and same for columns.

So, the number of ways to assign rows is 3^5, since each row has 3 choices. Similarly, 3^5 for columns. But we have the constraints that W_r and B_r are disjoint, and W_c and B_c are disjoint.

Wait, but in reality, each row must be assigned to exactly one of W_r, B_r, or E_r (empty). So, the number of ways to assign rows is 3^5, same for columns.

But when we multiply them, we get 3^5 × 3^5 = 3^10, but this counts all possible assignments, including those where W_r and B_r are overlapping, which isn't allowed.

Wait, no. Because in our model, W_r and B_r are disjoint. So, for rows, the number of valid assignments is the number of ways to partition the 5 rows into W_r, B_r, and E_r, with W_r ∩ B_r = ∅. Similarly for columns.

Wait, but the count for rows is equal to the number of ways to assign each row to W_r, B_r, or E_r, with the condition that a row can't be in both W_r and B_r. So, for each row, 3 choices: W, B, or E. But W and B are mutually exclusive. So, the total number of row assignments is 3^5.

Similarly, for columns, it's 3^5.

But the problem is that when we choose row assignments and column assignments, the white and black regions W_r × W_c and B_r × B_c must not overlap. Since W_r and B_r are disjoint, and W_c and B_c are disjoint, the cross products will also be disjoint.

So, the total number of arrangements is 3^5 × 3^5 = 3^10.

But wait, this counts all possible assignments, including those where the white and black regions overlap, which would result in cells that are both white and black, which is impossible.

Wait, no. Because if a cell is in W_r × W_c, it's white. If it's in B_r × B_c, it's black. Since W_r and B_r are disjoint, and W_c and B_c are disjoint, their cross products are also disjoint. So, no cell is both white and black.

Wait, that's correct. So, the total number of such arrangements is indeed 3^5 × 3^5 = 3^10 = 59049.

But wait, that can't be right because the problem requires that the arrangement is maximal. So, we need to subtract the arrangements where it's possible to add more chips without violating the conditions.

In other words, some of these 59049 arrangements are not maximal. So, how do we count only the maximal ones?

Wait, the arrangement is maximal if there are no empty cells that could be filled without violating the constraints. So, in terms of our model, this would mean that every empty cell is either in a row that's already assigned to a color (so you can't place a different color there) or in a column that's already assigned to a color.

Wait, that's exactly the case in our model, because any empty cell is either in E_r × (W_c ∪ B_c) or (W_r ∪ B_r) × E_c, or in E_r × E_c. But in the first two cases, you can't place a chip because the row or column is already assigned to a color. In the last case, both row and column are empty, so you could place a chip there, but that would require assigning that row and column to a color, which would conflict with other cells.

Wait, but in our model, the arrangement is maximal if there are no empty cells where both the row and column are empty. Because if there's a cell (i,j) where row i is empty and column j is empty, then you could place a chip there, which would require assigning row i and column j to that color, which might not be possible without violating other constraints.

Wait, but in our model, the empty cells are those where either row i is empty, column j is empty, or the row and column are assigned to different colors.

Wait, perhaps the maximal condition requires that there are no empty cells where both the row and column are empty. Because in that case, you could place a chip there, which would require assigning that row and column to a color, but they're currently empty, so you could assign them to white or black.

So, to ensure the arrangement is maximal, there must be no cells (i,j) where both row i and column j are empty. Because in such a case, you could place a white or black chip there, which would require changing the assignments of row i and column j, which might not be possible without violating existing constraints.

Therefore, the arrangement is maximal if and only if the set E_r × E_c is empty. That is, there are no rows and columns that are both empty. So, E_r and E_c must be disjoint. Wait, no. Because E_r is the set of empty rows, and E_c is the set of empty columns. So, the condition is that E_r ∩ E_c = ∅. Because if there's a row in E_r and a column in E_c, their intersection is an empty cell, and you could place a chip there, making the arrangement non-maximal.

Wait, no. Because if E_r and E_c are not disjoint, meaning there exists a row i in E_r and a column j in E_c, then cell (i,j) is empty, and you could place a chip there, but that would require assigning row i and column j to that color, which might not be possible without affecting other cells.

Therefore, to make the arrangement maximal, E_r and E_c must be disjoint. That is, there are no rows and columns that are both empty. So, E_r ∩ E_c = ∅.

So, in terms of our earlier model, the condition is that the set of empty rows and the set of empty columns are disjoint. So, E_r ∩ E_c = ∅.

So, how do we count the number of such arrangements where E_r ∩ E_c = ∅?

Well, let's think about it.

Each row can be assigned to W_r, B_r, or E_r.

Each column can be assigned to W_c, B_c, or E_c.

We need to count the number of assignments where E_r ∩ E_c = ∅.

So, for any row in E_r, all columns must be in W_c ∪ B_c. Similarly, for any column in E_c, all rows must be in W_r ∪ B_r.

Wait, but E_r is the set of rows not in W_r ∪ B_r.

Similarly, E_c is the set of columns not in W_c ∪ B_c.

So, the condition E_r ∩ E_c = ∅ means that there is no row i in E_r and column j in E_c such that (i,j) is empty.

But wait, if E_r and E_c are disjoint, that means that for every row in E_r, all columns are in W_c ∪ B_c, and for every column in E_c, all rows are in W_r ∪ B_r.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to model this as a bipartite graph where we have rows and columns, and we can assign colors to them, ensuring that E_r and E_c are disjoint.

But I'm getting a bit stuck. Maybe I can think in terms of inclusion-exclusion.

The total number of assignments is 3^5 × 3^5 = 3^10.

From this, we need to subtract the number of assignments where E_r ∩ E_c ≠ ∅, i.e., there exists at least one row in E_r and one column in E_c.

But this might get complicated. Alternatively, perhaps we can model this as choosing E_r and E_c such that E_r ∩ E_c = ∅.

So, the number of ways to choose E_r and E_c such that E_r ∩ E_c = ∅.

But E_r is a subset of rows, and E_c is a subset of columns. So, the condition is that E_r and E_c are disjoint as sets.

Wait, but E_r is a subset of the 5 rows, and E_c is a subset of the 5 columns. So, the condition E_r ∩ E_c = ∅ is automatically satisfied because rows and columns are different entities. Wait, no. Because E_r is a subset of rows, and E_c is a subset of columns. They can't intersect because rows and columns are different. So, E_r and E_c are always disjoint as sets. So, the condition E_r ∩ E_c = ∅ is automatically satisfied.

Wait, that makes sense. Because E_r is a set of row indices, and E_c is a set of column indices. So, their intersection is empty because rows and columns are distinct. So, in our model, the condition E_r ∩ E_c = ∅ is automatically satisfied, meaning that all assignments where W_r, B_r, W_c, B_c are chosen with W_r ∩ B_r = ∅ and W_c ∩ B_c = ∅, the arrangement is maximal.

Wait, but that can't be right because in some cases, you could have empty cells where both row and column are empty, which would allow you to add a chip, making the arrangement non-maximal.

But according to our earlier reasoning, E_r and E_c are always disjoint because they're subsets of different sets (rows and columns). So, in our model, there are no cells where both the row and column are empty. So, all empty cells are either in a row that's assigned to a color or a column that's assigned to a color.

Wait, so in our model, any empty cell is either in a row that's white or black, or in a column that's white or black. So, you can't have a cell that's in both an empty row and an empty column. Therefore, the arrangement is automatically maximal because every empty cell is in a row or column that's already assigned a color, preventing you from adding a chip of a different color without violating the constraints.

Wait, that makes sense. So, in this model, every arrangement where the grid is divided into white and black rectangles, with the rest being empty (in rows or columns assigned to colors), is maximal because you can't add any more chips without violating the constraints.

So, the total number of such arrangements is 3^5 × 3^5 = 3^10 = 59049.

But wait, that's the total number of ways to assign rows and columns to W, B, or E, with W and B being disjoint. But the problem requires that the placement is such that any additional chip would violate the conditions. So, according to our reasoning, all these 59049 arrangements are maximal.

But that can't be right because, for example, if all rows and all columns are assigned to white, then the entire grid is white, which is maximal because you can't add any more chips. Similarly, if all rows are white and some columns are black, then the arrangement is maximal.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Let me think about a specific example. Suppose I have W_r = {1,2}, B_r = {3,4,5}, W_c = {1,2,3}, B_c = {4,5}. Then, the white region is 2x3=6 cells, black region is 3x2=6 cells. The total is 12 cells, which is less than 25. So, you could add more chips, but according to our model, this arrangement is maximal because every empty cell is in a row or column assigned to a color.

Wait, but in reality, you could add a white chip in row 1, column 4, but that would require column 4 to be white, which it's currently black. So that's not allowed. Similarly, you can't add a black chip in row 1, column 4, because row 1 is white.

So, in this case, the arrangement is indeed maximal because you can't add any more chips without violating the row or column constraints.

Another example: suppose all rows are white, and all columns are white. Then, the entire grid is white, which is maximal. Similarly, if all rows are white and some columns are black, then the white region is the intersection of white rows and white columns, and the black region is the intersection of black rows and black columns. But in this case, since all rows are white, the black region must be empty. So, the arrangement is all white, which is maximal.

Wait, but suppose I have some rows assigned to white, some to black, and some to empty. Similarly for columns. Then, the arrangement is maximal because any empty cell is in a row or column assigned to a color, so you can't add a chip there without changing the color assignment of that row or column.

Therefore, all 3^5 × 3^5 = 59049 arrangements are maximal.

But that seems too large. The problem is about placing chips on a 5x5 grid, which has 25 cells. The number of possible maximal arrangements can't be that large, can it?

Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me read it again.

The problem says: Find the number of ways to place some of these chips in the 25 unit cells of a 5x5 grid such that:

1. Each cell contains at most one chip.

2. All chips in the same row and all chips in the same column have the same color.

3. Any additional chip placed on the grid would violate one or more of the previous two conditions.

So, the arrangement must be a maximal placement satisfying conditions 1 and 2.

In our model, the arrangement is determined by assigning each row to W, B, or E, and each column to W, B, or E, with W and B being disjoint for both rows and columns. The number of such assignments is 3^5 × 3^5 = 59049.

But that seems too large. Let me think about smaller cases.

Suppose we have a 1x1 grid. Then, the number of maximal arrangements would be:

- Assign row 1 to W, column 1 to W: place a white chip.

- Assign row 1 to B, column 1 to B: place a black chip.

- Assign row 1 to W, column 1 to B: cell is empty, but since it's 1x1, can we place a chip? If we assign row 1 to W and column 1 to B, then cell (1,1) is empty. But can we place a chip there? No, because row 1 is white and column 1 is black, so we can't place a chip. So, the arrangement is already maximal.

Wait, no. Wait, in this case, the arrangement where row 1 is white and column 1 is black would have cell (1,1) empty. But can we place a chip there? No, because row 1 is white and column 1 is black, so you can't place a white or black chip there. So, the arrangement is maximal.

Similarly, if row 1 is empty and column 1 is empty, then cell (1,1) is empty. But can we place a chip there? Yes, because neither the row nor the column is assigned to any color. So, placing a white or black chip would require assigning the row and column to that color, but since they are currently empty, you could do that. Therefore, the arrangement where row 1 is empty and column 1 is empty is not maximal because you can place a chip there.

Wait, so in the 1x1 case, the maximal arrangements are:

1. Cell is white: row 1 is W, column 1 is W.

2. Cell is black: row 1 is B, column 1 is B.

3. Row 1 is W, column 1 is B: cell is empty, but can't place any chip because row is W and column is B.

4. Row 1 is B, column 1 is W: cell is empty, can't place any chip.

5. Row 1 is W, column 1 is E: cell is empty, but can't place any chip because row is W.

6. Row 1 is E, column 1 is W: cell is empty, can't place any chip because column is W.

7. Row 1 is B, column 1 is E: cell is empty, can't place any chip because row is B.

8. Row 1 is E, column 1 is B: cell is empty, can't place any chip because column is B.

9. Row 1 is E, column 1 is E: cell is empty, and you can place a chip here. So this arrangement is not maximal.

So, in the 1x1 case, the maximal arrangements are the 8 cases where either the row or column is assigned to a color, except when both are empty. So, the number of maximal arrangements is 8, which is 3^1 × 3^1 - 1 = 8.

Wait, but according to our earlier model, the number of assignments is 3^1 × 3^1 =9, and the only non-maximal arrangement is when both row and column are empty. So, maximal arrangements are 9 -1=8, which matches.

So, in the 1x1 case, the number of maximal arrangements is 8.

Similarly, in the 2x2 case, the number would be 3^2 × 3^2 - something. But according to our earlier reasoning, all assignments except those where E_r and E_c are non-empty (i.e., where both row and column are empty) are maximal.

Wait, but in the 2x2 case, the number of maximal arrangements would be 3^2 × 3^2 - (number of arrangements where E_r and E_c are non-empty). But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps in the general case, the number of maximal arrangements is 3^5 × 3^5 - (number of arrangements where E_r and E_c are non-empty). But this might not be the right approach.

Wait, but in the 1x1 case, the number of maximal arrangements is 8, which is 3^2 -1. But in the 2x2 case, it's more complicated.

Wait, perhaps the number of maximal arrangements is equal to the number of ways to assign rows and columns to W, B, or E, such that there are no empty cells where both the row and column are empty. Because in such cases, you could place a chip, making the arrangement non-maximal.

So, the number of maximal arrangements is equal to the number of assignments where for every row in E_r, all columns are in W_c ∪ B_c, and for every column in E_c, all rows are in W_r ∪ B_r. Which is equivalent to saying that E_r ∩ E_c = ∅, but since E_r is a set of rows and E_c is a set of columns, their intersection is always empty. So, perhaps all assignments are maximal except those where both row and column are empty for some cell.

Wait, but in our model, E_r and E_c are subsets of rows and columns, respectively, so their intersection is always empty. Therefore, the only non-maximal arrangements are those where there exists at least one cell (i,j) such that row i is in E_r and column j is in E_c. Because in that case, cell (i,j) is empty, and you could place a chip there, making the arrangement non-maximal.

So, the number of maximal arrangements is equal to the total number of assignments minus the number of assignments where E_r ∩ E_c ≠ ∅.

But E_r and E_c are disjoint by nature, so E_r ∩ E_c is always empty. Wait, no, E_r is a set of row indices, E_c is a set of column indices. So, E_r ∩ E_c is empty as sets, but for individual cells, a cell (i,j) could have row i in E_r and column j in E_c, making that cell empty.

Ah, that's the point. So, the condition is that there are no cells (i,j) where row i is in E_r and column j is in E_c. Because in such cases, you could place a chip there, making the arrangement non-maximal.

So, the number of maximal arrangements is equal to the number of assignments where E_r × E_c is empty. That is, there are no cells (i,j) where row i is in E_r and column j is in E_c.

In other words, for all i in E_r, j must not be in E_c. Or, for all j in E_c, i must not be in E_r.

Which is equivalent to saying that E_r and E_c are disjoint as sets of indices, but since they are from different universes (rows and columns), their intersection is always empty. Wait, no, because E_r is a subset of row indices, and E_c is a subset of column indices, their intersection is always empty. So, for any assignment, E_r and E_c are disjoint as sets, but individual cells can have row in E_r and column in E_c.

Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me rephrase.

Each assignment defines E_r and E_c. For the arrangement to be maximal, there must be no cell (i,j) where row i is in E_r and column j is in E_c. Because in such a case, you could place a chip at (i,j), which would require assigning row i and column j to that color, which would conflict with the existing assignments.

Therefore, the condition for maximality is that E_r × E_c = ∅, which means that for every i in E_r, j is not in E_c, and vice versa. But since E_r is a set of row indices and E_c is a set of column indices, the only way E_r × E_c = ∅ is if E_r = ∅ or E_c = ∅.

Wait, no. Because E_r × E_c is the set of cells where row i is in E_r and column j is in E_c. For this set to be empty, it must be that for every i in E_r, j is not in E_c for any j. Which implies that E_c must be a subset of the columns not in any row's E_r. But this is getting too abstract.

Wait, perhaps the only way to ensure that E_r × E_c = ∅ is to have E_r = ∅ or E_c = ∅. Because if E_r ≠ ∅ and E_c ≠ ∅, then there exists at least one row i in E_r and at least one column j in E_c, so cell (i,j) is empty, and you could place a chip there, making the arrangement non-maximal.

Therefore, the number of maximal arrangements is equal to the number of assignments where either E_r = ∅ or E_c = ∅.

So, the number of assignments where E_r = ∅ is the number of ways to assign rows to W_r and B_r, with W_r ∩ B_r = ∅, and assign columns to W_c, B_c, E_c. Similarly, the number of assignments where E_c = ∅ is the number of ways to assign columns to W_c and B_c, with W_c ∩ B_c = ∅, and assign rows to W_r, B_r, E_r.

But we must subtract the overlap where both E_r = ∅ and E_c = ∅, because otherwise we'd double count.

So, using inclusion-exclusion:

Number of maximal arrangements = (number of assignments with E_r = ∅) + (number of assignments with E_c = ∅) - (number of assignments with E_r = ∅ and E_c = ∅).

Now, let's compute each term.

1. Number of assignments with E_r = ∅: This means that every row is assigned to either W_r or B_r. So, each row has 2 choices: W or B. So, 2^5 ways to assign rows.

For columns, E_c can be any subset, but E_c must be disjoint from E_r. Wait, no. Wait, in this case, E_r = ∅, so columns can be assigned to W_c, B_c, or E_c without any restriction. So, for columns, each column has 3 choices: W, B, or E. So, 3^5 ways.

Therefore, the number of assignments with E_r = ∅ is 2^5 × 3^5.

2. Number of assignments with E_c = ∅: Similarly, each column is assigned to W or B, so 2^5 ways. For rows, each row can be W, B, or E, so 3^5 ways. So, 3^5 × 2^5.

3. Number of assignments with both E_r = ∅ and E_c = ∅: Here, rows are assigned to W or B (2^5 ways), and columns are assigned to W or B (2^5 ways). So, total assignments: 2^5 × 2^5 = 2^10.

Putting it all together:

Number of maximal arrangements = (2^5 × 3^5) + (3^5 × 2^5) - (2^5 × 2^5)
= 2×(2^5 × 3^5) - 2^10
= 2×(32 × 243) - 1024
= 2×7776 - 1024
= 15552 - 1024
= 14528.

Wait, but wait. Let me compute 2^5 × 3^5:

2^5 = 32

3^5 = 243

32 × 243 = 7776

So, 2×7776 = 15552

2^10 = 1024

So, 15552 - 1024 = 14528.

But wait, this seems too high. Also, in the 1x1 case, applying this formula would give:

Number of maximal arrangements = (2^1 × 3^1) + (3^1 × 2^1) - (2^1 × 2^1) = (2×3)+(3×2) - (2×2) = 6 +6 -4=8, which matches the earlier result.

So, perhaps this formula is correct.

But let me think again. For the 2x2 grid, what would this formula give?

Number of maximal arrangements = (2^2 × 3^2) + (3^2 × 2^2) - (2^2 × 2^2)
= (4×9) + (9×4) - (4×4)
= 36 + 36 -16 = 56.

But I can try to count manually for 2x2.

But perhaps it's better to proceed.

So, according to this formula, the number of maximal arrangements for the 5x5 grid is 14528.

But the problem is about placing some chips, not all possible assignments. Wait, no, the problem allows placing any number of chips up to 25, as long as the conditions are met.

But according to our model, each arrangement is determined by assigning rows and columns to W, B, or E, and the chips are placed accordingly. So, the number of maximal arrangements is 14528.

But wait, the problem statement says "any additional chip placed on the grid would violate one or more of the previous two conditions." So, the arrangement must be maximal.

Therefore, the answer should be 14528.

But let me double-check the formula.

Number of assignments where E_r = ∅: 2^5 × 3^5 = 32 × 243 = 7776.

Number of assignments where E_c = ∅: 3^5 × 2^5 = same as above, 7776.

Number of assignments where both E_r = ∅ and E_c = ∅: 2^5 × 2^5 = 1024.

So, total maximal arrangements = 7776 + 7776 - 1024 = 14528.

Yes, that seems correct.

Therefore, the number of ways is 14528.

But wait, the problem asks for the number of ways to place some of the chips. Each arrangement corresponds to a unique placement of white and black chips, with the rest empty.

But in our model, each arrangement is determined by the row and column assignments, which may result in different numbers of white and black chips.

But the problem allows us to use up to 25 white and 25 black chips, but in reality, the number of chips used is |W_r| × |W_c| + |B_r| × |B_c|, which can be up to 25.

But in our count, we're considering all possible such arrangements, regardless of the number of chips used, as long as they are maximal.

So, the answer should be 14528.

But wait, the problem specifies that we have 25 white and 25 black chips, but we're placing some of them. So, the count should consider all possible numbers of white and black chips placed, up to the grid's capacity.

But in our model, the count already considers all possible such placements, so the answer is 14528.

Wait, but 14528 is equal to 2×3^5×2^5 - 2^10, which is 2×7776 - 1024 = 14528.

But let me think about the initial model again. The problem is about placing chips on the grid, so each arrangement corresponds to a specific placement. But in our count, we're considering all possible assignments of rows and columns to W, B, or E, leading to a specific placement.

Therefore, the number of maximal arrangements is 14528.

But I'm a bit unsure. Let me think: in the 1x1 case, it's 8, which matches. For 2x2, it's 56, which seems plausible.

So, I think the answer is 14528.


The problem involves placing chips on a 5x5 grid under specific constraints. Each row and column must be uniformly white, black, or empty, and the arrangement must be maximal, meaning no additional chips can be placed without violating the constraints. 

To solve this, we model the grid by assigning each row and column to either white (W), black (B), or empty (E). The key insight is that for the arrangement to be maximal, there must be no empty cells where both the row and column are empty. This ensures that every empty cell is either in a row or column assigned to a color, preventing any additional chips from being placed.

Using combinatorial methods, we calculate the number of valid assignments:

1. **Assignments where all rows are assigned (E_r = ∅):** Each row has 2 choices (W or B), and each column has 3 choices (W, B, or E). This gives \(2^5 \times 3^5 = 7776\) arrangements.
2. **Assignments where all columns are assigned (E_c = ∅):** Similarly, each column has 2 choices, and each row has 3 choices, giving another \(3^5 \times 2^5 = 7776\) arrangements.
3. **Overlap where both rows and columns are fully assigned (E_r = ∅ and E_c = ∅):** Each row and column has 2 choices, resulting in \(2^{10} = 1024\) arrangements.

Using inclusion-exclusion, the total number of maximal arrangements is:
\[
7776 + 7776 - 1024 = 14528
\]

Thus, the number of ways to place the chips is:

\boxed{14528}
