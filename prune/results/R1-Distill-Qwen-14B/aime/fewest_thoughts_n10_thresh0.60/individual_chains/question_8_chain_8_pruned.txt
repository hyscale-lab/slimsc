Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the number of triples of nonnegative integers (a, b, c) that satisfy two conditions: a + b + c = 300 and a²b + a²c + b²a + b²c + c²a + c²b = 6,000,000. Hmm, that looks a bit intimidating at first glance, but maybe if I break it down, I can figure it out.

First, I know that a, b, and c are nonnegative integers, so they can be zero or any positive integer. The first condition is a linear equation, and the second condition is a bit more complex—a quadratic expression. I remember that sometimes when dealing with symmetric expressions, it's helpful to use symmetric sums or even think about factoring or substitution.

Let me write down the given equations:

1. a + b + c = 300
2. a²b + a²c + b²a + b²c + c²a + c²b = 6,000,000

Looking at the second equation, I notice that it's symmetric in a, b, and c. Each term is a product of one squared variable and another variable. So, maybe I can factor this expression somehow or express it in terms of symmetric sums.

I recall that for three variables, the symmetric sums are:

- S1 = a + b + c
- S2 = ab + bc + ca
- S3 = abc

But the expression I have isn't directly S1, S2, or S3, but maybe it can be expressed using these. Let me see.

Wait, the given expression is a²b + a²c + b²a + b²c + c²a + c²b. I can factor this as a²(b + c) + b²(a + c) + c²(a + b). Let's compute that.

Since a + b + c = 300, then b + c = 300 - a, a + c = 300 - b, and a + b = 300 - c. So substituting these into the expression:

= a²(300 - a) + b²(300 - b) + c²(300 - c)

Hmm, that's another way to write it, which simplifies to:

= 300(a² + b² + c²) - (a³ + b³ + c³)

So, the second equation can be rewritten as:

300(a² + b² + c²) - (a³ + b³ + c³) = 6,000,000

Let me denote Q = a² + b² + c² and C = a³ + b³ + c³. Then, the equation becomes:

300Q - C = 6,000,000

So, 300Q - C = 6,000,000. My goal is to find (a, b, c) such that this holds, along with a + b + c = 300.

I should try to express Q and C in terms of S1, S2, S3.

I remember that:

Q = a² + b² + c² = (a + b + c)² - 2(ab + bc + ca) = S1² - 2S2

Similarly, for C, the sum of cubes:

C = a³ + b³ + c³ = (a + b + c)^3 - 3(a + b + c)(ab + bc + ca) + 3abc = S1³ - 3S1S2 + 3S3

So, plugging these into the equation:

300(S1² - 2S2) - [S1³ - 3S1S2 + 3S3] = 6,000,000

We know S1 = 300, so let's substitute that in:

300(300² - 2S2) - [300³ - 3*300*S2 + 3S3] = 6,000,000

Let's compute each part step by step.

First, compute 300²: 300 * 300 = 90,000.

So, 300² - 2S2 = 90,000 - 2S2

Multiply this by 300:

300*(90,000 - 2S2) = 300*90,000 - 300*2S2 = 27,000,000 - 600S2

Next, compute the second part: [300³ - 3*300*S2 + 3S3]

300³ is 27,000,000.

3*300*S2 is 900 S2.

So, the second part is [27,000,000 - 900 S2 + 3 S3]

Now, putting it all back into the equation:

[27,000,000 - 600 S2] - [27,000,000 - 900 S2 + 3 S3] = 6,000,000

Let me distribute the negative sign:

27,000,000 - 600 S2 -27,000,000 + 900 S2 - 3 S3 = 6,000,000

Simplify terms:

27,000,000 -27,000,000 cancels out.

-600 S2 + 900 S2 = 300 S2

-3 S3 remains.

So now, the equation becomes:

300 S2 - 3 S3 = 6,000,000

I can factor out a 3:

3(100 S2 - S3) = 6,000,000

Divide both sides by 3:

100 S2 - S3 = 2,000,000

So, now I have:

100 S2 - S3 = 2,000,000

And I also know that S1 = 300.

So, to recap, I have the following:

S1 = a + b + c = 300

And,

100 S2 - S3 = 2,000,000

So, perhaps I can write S3 in terms of S2:

S3 = 100 S2 - 2,000,000

So, S3 is expressed in terms of S2.

Now, I need to find nonnegative integers a, b, c such that:

a + b + c = 300

ab + bc + ca = S2

abc = S3 = 100 S2 - 2,00
