Okay, so I'm trying to solve this problem where points A, B, C, D are on the hyperbola given by the equation x²/20 - y²/24 = 1. These points form a rhombus ABCD, and the diagonals intersect at the origin. I need to find the greatest real number that is less than BD² for all such rhombi.

First off, I remember that a rhombus has all sides equal and its diagonals bisect each other at right angles. Wait, no, actually, the diagonals bisect each other and the angles, but they don't necessarily have to be perpendicular unless it's a square. Wait, no, in a rhombus, the diagonals are not necessarily perpendicular, but they do bisect each other at right angles. Wait, no, actually, in a rhombus, the diagonals are perpendicular. Yeah, that's right. So, the diagonals intersect each other at 90 degrees and bisect each other.

Given that the diagonals intersect at the origin, which is (0,0), that must be the midpoint of both diagonals. So, if A is a point on the hyperbola, then the opposite point C must be such that the midpoint of AC is the origin. Therefore, if A has coordinates (x, y), then C must be (-x, -y). Similarly, if B is (p, q), then D is (-p, -q).

So, points A, B, C, D are (x, y), (p, q), (-x, -
