Okay, so I have this problem about Aya's morning walk. Let me try to understand what's going on here. 

Every morning, Aya walks 9 kilometers. She stops at a coffee shop afterward, and it seems like the time she spends at the coffee shop is consistentâ€”t minutes. The problem gives me two different scenarios about her walking speed and the total time, including the coffee stop. I need to find out how long her walk takes when she walks at a speed of s + 1/2 km/h, including the t minutes at the coffee shop.

Hmm, let's break down the information given.

First scenario: She walks at a constant speed of s km/h. The total time taken for the walk, including t minutes in the coffee shop, is 4 hours. So, that's 4 hours in total. 

Wait, but 4 hours is pretty long for a 9 km walk. Let me check: if she walks 9 km at s km/h, the time taken just for walking would be 9/s hours, right? And then she spends t minutes at the coffee shop. So the total time is 9/s hours plus t minutes. 

But wait, t is in minutes, so I need to convert that to hours to keep the units consistent. So t minutes is t/60 hours. So the equation from the first scenario is:

9/s + t/60 = 4 hours.

Second scenario: She walks at s + 2 km/h. The total time is 2 hours and 24 minutes. Let me convert that to hours as well. 24 minutes is 24/60 = 0.4 hours, so total time is 2.4 hours. 

Again, the time taken for walking is 9/(s+2) hours, and then she spends t minutes, which is t/60 hours. So the equation here is:

9/(s+2) + t/60 = 2.4 hours.

So now I have two equations:

1. 9/s + t/60 = 4
2. 9/(s + 2) + t/60 = 2.4

I need to solve these two equations to find s and t. Once I have s, I can compute the time when she walks at s + 1/2 km/h, which is s + 0.5 km/h. So,
