Okay, so I have this problem about a convex equilateral hexagon where each pair of opposite sides is parallel. The hexagon is labeled ABCDEF. The triangle formed by extending the sides AB, CD, and EF has side lengths of 200, 240, and 300. I need to find the side length of the hexagon.

Hmm. Let me try to visualize this. A convex hexagon with all sides equal and opposite sides parallel. That makes me think of a regular hexagon, but wait, in a regular hexagon, all sides are equal and all angles are equal, but here it's only given that opposite sides are parallel and all sides are equal. So it's not necessarily regular. But since it's equilateral and opposite sides are parallel, it must be something like a "uniform" hexagon, maybe similar to a regular one but stretched or compressed along some axes.

Now, the triangle formed by extending AB, CD, and EF. Let me think about how that works. If I extend AB, CD, and EF, they meet to form a triangle. So these three sides, when extended, intersect each other. Since the hexagon is convex, these extensions will form a triangle outside the hexagon.

I remember that in such cases, the sides of the triangle can be related to the sides of the hexagon through some ratio. Maybe similar triangles are involved here. Let me try to recall if there's a theorem or property related to this.

Wait, I think this is related to the concept of the "outer triangle" formed by extending the sides of a convex hexagon with opposite sides parallel. I remember that the sides of this outer triangle are proportional to the sides of the hexagon. But I'm not exactly sure about the exact relationship.

Let me try to draw a rough sketch in my mind. The hexagon is convex, so all the internal angles are less than 180 degrees. Since opposite sides are parallel, the hexagon is sometimes referred to as a "zonogon." In a zonogon, opposite sides are equal and parallel, but wait, in this problem, the hexagon is equilateral, so all sides are equal, but opposite sides are parallel. So that's a specific case of a zonogon.

I think in such a hexagon, the sides can be considered as vectors, and because opposite sides are equal and parallel, the sum of these vectors is zero. That makes sense because when you traverse around the hexagon, you end up where you started.

So, imagine each side is a vector: AB, BC, CD, DE, EF, FA. Since opposite sides are equal and parallel, AB is equal and parallel to DE, BC is equal and parallel to EF, and CD is equal and parallel to FA. So, AB = DE, BC = EF, CD = FA as vectors.

But since all sides are equal in length, each side has the same magnitude, but different directions.

Now, the triangle formed by extending AB, CD, and EF. Let's denote the triangle as PQR, where P is the intersection of extensions of AB and CD, Q is the intersection of extensions of CD and EF, and R is the intersection of extensions of EF and AB.

Wait, no. Let me correct that. If I extend AB, CD, and EF, they form a triangle. So, the sides of the triangle are the extensions beyond the hexagon. So, for instance, if I extend AB beyond B and A, CD beyond C and D, and EF beyond E and F, then these extensions intersect at three points forming a larger triangle.

Let me think about the proportions here. Since the hexagon is equilateral and opposite sides are parallel, the triangle formed by the extensions should be similar to the hexagon's sides in some way.

I recall that in such
