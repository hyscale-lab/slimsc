Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the number of triples of nonnegative integers (a, b, c) that satisfy two conditions: a + b + c = 300 and a²b + a²c + b²a + b²c + c²a + c²b = 6,000,000. Hmm, that seems a bit complicated, but maybe I can break it down.

First, let me write down the given equations:

1. a + b + c = 300
2. a²b + a²c + b²a + b²c + c²a + c²b = 6,000,000

I'm supposed to find the number of nonnegative integer solutions (a, b, c) to these equations.

Let me try to understand the second equation better. It looks like each term is a product of two variables where one is squared. So, for example, a²b, a²c, etc. Maybe I can factor this expression somehow.

Looking at the terms, I notice that each term has two variables, and one of them is squared. If I factor, say, a² from the first two terms, I get a²(b + c). Similarly, I can factor b² from the next two terms to get b²(a + c), and c² from the last two terms to get c²(a + b).

So, the second equation can be rewritten as:

a²(b + c) + b²(a + c) + c²(a + b) = 6,000,000

Hmm, that's a bit simpler. Now, I also know from the first equation that a + b + c = 300, so I can express (b + c) as 300 - a, (a + c) as 300 - b, and (a + b) as 300 - c.

Substituting these into the second equation, I get:

a²(300 - a) + b²(300 - b) + c²(300 - c) = 6,000,000

Hmm, this looks a bit more manageable. Let me write this as:

300a² - a³ + 300b² - b³ + 300c² - c³ = 6,000,000

Which can be rephrased as:

300(a² + b² + c²) - (a³ + b³ + c³) = 6,000,000

I wonder if there's a way to relate a² + b² + c² and a³ + b³ + c³ using known algebraic identities. Let me recall that (a + b + c)^2 = a² + b² + c² + 2(ab + bc + ca). Since a + b + c is 300, maybe I can find a² + b² + c² in terms of ab + bc + ca.

Let me denote S = a + b + c = 300, and Q = ab + bc + ca, and C = abc. I think these are standard symmetric sums.

From the identity:

S² = a² + b² + c² + 2Q

So, a² + b² + c² = S² - 2Q = 300² - 2Q = 90,000 - 2Q.

So, substituting back into the equation, 300(a² + b² + c²) becomes 300*(90,000 - 2Q) = 27,000,000 - 600Q.

Now, the equation becomes:

27,000,000 - 600Q - (a³ + b³ + c³) = 6,000,000

Let me rearrange this equation:

- (a³ + b³ + c³) = 6,000,000 - 27,000,000 + 600Q

Which simplifies to:

- (a³ + b³ + c³) = -21,000,000 + 600Q

Multiply both sides by -1:

a³ + b³ + c³ = 21,000,000 - 600Q

Hmm, okay. Now, I know another identity involving a³ + b³ + c³. The identity is:

a³ + b³ + c³ = (a + b + c)^3 - 3(a + b + c)(ab + bc + ca) + 3abc

So, substituting the known values:

a³ + b³ + c³ = S³ - 3S Q + 3C = 300³ - 3*300*Q + 3C

Compute 300³: 300^3 is 27,000,000. So,

a³ + b³ + c³ = 27,000,000 - 900 Q + 3C

But earlier, we had a³ + b³ + c³ = 21,000,000 - 600 Q

So, setting these equal:

27,000,000 - 900 Q + 3C = 21,000,000 - 600 Q

Let me bring all terms to one side:

27,000,000 - 21,000,000 - 900 Q + 600 Q + 3C = 0

Simplify:

6,000,000 - 300 Q + 3C = 0

Divide both sides by 3:

2,000,000 - 100 Q + C = 0

So,

C = 100 Q - 2,000,000

Hmm, interesting. So, C = abc = 100 Q - 2,000,000.

But wait, Q is ab + bc + ca, which is a symmetric sum. So, we have Q and C in terms of each other.

Now, let me think about what we have so far. We have:

1. a + b + c = 300
2. Q = ab + bc + ca
3. C = abc = 100 Q - 2,000,000

So, we can write the cubic equation whose roots are a, b, c:

x³ - S x² + Q x - C = 0

Which becomes:

x³ - 300 x² + Q x - (100 Q - 2,000,000) = 0

Simplify:

x³ - 300 x² + Q x - 100 Q + 2,000,000 = 0

Factor out Q:

x³ - 300 x² + Q (x - 100) + 2,000,000 = 0

Hmm, not sure if that helps directly, but perhaps I can find more constraints.

Wait, all a, b, c are nonnegative integers. So, Q and C must also be integers, and since Q = ab + bc + ca, and a, b, c are nonnegative integers, Q must be nonnegative as well. Similarly, C = abc is nonnegative.

From C = 100 Q - 2,000,000, since C must be nonnegative, 100 Q - 2,000,000 >= 0 => Q >= 20,000.

So, Q >= 20,000.

But Q is ab + bc + ca, so perhaps I can find the maximum possible value for Q?

Wait, the maximum of ab + bc + ca given a + b + c = 300 occurs when two variables are as large as possible and the third is as small as possible. For example, when c = 0, then ab is maximized when a = b = 150, so ab = 22,500. So, in that case, ab + bc + ca = 22,500 + 0 + 0 = 22,500.

Wait, wait, that can't be right because if c is 0, then a + b = 300, and ab is (a)(300 - a) which is maximized when a = 150, giving ab = 22,500.
