Okay, so I have this problem about a torus and a sphere. Let me try to visualize it. The torus, T, is formed by rotating a circle of radius 3 around an axis that's 6 units away from the center of the circle. So, it's like a donut shape with a big hole. The sphere, S, has a radius of 11. I need to find the difference between the radii of the circles where T is tangent to S when it's inside and outside. The answer should be a fraction m/n, and then I have to find m + n.

Hmm. Let me think about the torus first. A torus can be described using two radii: the major radius R, which is the distance from the center of the generating circle to the axis of revolution, and the minor radius r, which is the radius of the generating circle itself. In this case, R is 6 and r is 3. So, the torus is T = (R=6, r=3).

Now, when the torus is inside the sphere, it's tangent along a circle. Similarly, when it's outside, it's tangent along another circle. I need to find the radii of these circles, r_i and r_o, and then compute their difference.

I remember that when two surfaces are tangent, they touch along a circle. In this case, both the torus and the sphere are surfaces of revolution, so their intersection should be a circle.

Let me consider the case when the torus is inside the sphere first. So, the torus is resting on the inside of the sphere. The sphere has radius 11, and the torus is inside, so the sphere is larger.

I think the key here is to find the distance from the center of the sphere to the center of the generating circle of the torus. Wait, because the torus is a surface of revolution, maybe the distance from the sphere's center to the torus's center plays a role.

Wait, no. The torus itself is a surface, so when it's inside the sphere, the sphere's center and the torus's center might not be the same. Hmm, maybe I need to model this in 3D coordinates.

Let me set up a coordinate system. Letâ€™s assume the sphere S is centered at the origin (0,0,0). The torus T is generated by rotating a circle of radius 3 around an axis that's 6 units away from its center. Let's say the axis of revolution of the torus is along the z-axis, but offset. Wait, no, that might complicate things.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to model the torus in a way that its center is along the same axis as the sphere's center, but the torus is offset. Hmm, I'm getting confused.

Wait, no. The torus is created by revolving a circle around an axis. Let me think of the generating circle: it's a circle of radius 3, and the axis is 6 units away from its center. So, the torus has a major radius R = 6 and minor radius r = 3.

Now, when the torus is inside the
