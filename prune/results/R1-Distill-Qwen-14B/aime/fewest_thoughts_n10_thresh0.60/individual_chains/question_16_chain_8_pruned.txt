Okay, so I have this problem here: I need to find the least prime number p such that there's a positive integer n where n^4 + 1 is divisible by p squared. Then, I have to find the smallest positive integer m where m^4 +1 is divisible by p squared. Hmm, that sounds a bit tricky, but let me break it down.

First, I think I should start by recalling some number theory concepts. I remember that primes where -1 is a quadratic residue might be relevant here. Wait, but this is about fourth powers. So maybe I should think about the equation n^4 ≡ -1 mod p^2. That would mean n^4 +1 is divisible by p^2.

So I need to find the smallest prime p where this congruence has a solution. I also remember that for primes p where p ≡ 1 mod 8, -1 is a quartic residue. Because if p is 1 mod 8, then the multiplicative group mod p is cyclic with order p-1, which is divisible by 8. So maybe such p exists where n^4 ≡ -1 mod p.

But wait, here we're dealing with p squared, not just p. So maybe the prime has to satisfy some higher condition. Let me think about Hensel's lemma, which is about lifting solutions from modulo p to modulo higher powers.

Hensel's lemma says that if f(n) ≡ 0 mod p and f'(n) not ≡ 0 mod p, then there's a unique lift modulo p^2. So in this case, f(n) = n^4 +1. So f'(n) = 4n^3. So if n is a solution mod p, and f'(n) ≡ 4n^3 ≡ 0 mod p, then Hensel's lemma can't be applied, meaning the solution might not lift uniquely or might not lift at all.

Wait, so for Hensel's lemma to apply, we need f'(n) not ≡0 mod p. So if 4n^3 ≡0 mod p, that would mean p divides 4n^3. But since p is prime, if p divides n, then n ≡0 mod p, but then n^4 ≡0 mod p, so n^4 +1 ≡1 mod p, which can't be 0. So p cannot divide n, so 4n^3 ≡0 mod p implies p divides 4. So p=2.

Hmm, but p is a prime, so maybe I should consider p=2 separately. Let's check p=2 first. Is there an n such that n^4 +1 is divisible by 4.

Let's compute n^4 mod 4 for n=1 and n=2. n=1: 1^4=1, 1+1=2, which is not divisible by 4. n=2: 16, 16+1=17, which is 1 mod 4. So 17 mod 4 is 1. So 2^2=4 doesn't divide n^4 +1 for any n, because n^4 is always 0 or 1 mod 4, so n^4 +1 is 1 or 2 mod 4. So p=2 is out.

So for p>2, I think we have that if n^4 ≡ -1 mod p, then we can try to see if this can be lifted to mod p^2. But for that, we need f'(n) ≡4n^3 ≡0 mod p? Wait, no, Hensel's lemma requires f'(n) not ≡0 mod p. So if 4n^3 ≡0 mod p, which would imply p divides 4n^3, but since n and p are coprime (because n^4 ≡-1 mod p, which is impossible if p divides n), so p must divide 4. But since p is odd (we've already considered p=2), p can't divide 4. So 4n^3 ≡0 mod p would only happen if p=2, which we already saw doesn't work. Therefore, for odd primes p, 4n^3 ≡0 mod p is impossible. So Hensel's lemma applies, meaning if n^4 ≡-1 mod p, then there's a unique lift to mod p^2.

So, our task reduces to finding the smallest prime p where -1 is a quartic residue modulo p, and then the minimal m is that n lifted to mod p^2.

Therefore, we need to find the smallest prime p where n^4 ≡ -1 mod p has a solution.

I remember that -1 is a quadratic residue modulo p if p ≡1 mod 4. But for quartic residues, it's a bit different. The multiplicative group mod p is cyclic of order p-1. So, -1 is a quartic residue if the order of -1 divides (p-1)/4 or something like that.

Let me think. The equation x^4 ≡ -1 mod p has a solution if and only if the order of -1 in the multiplicative group divides (p-1)/something.

Wait, the multiplicative group mod p is cyclic of order p-1. So, the equation x^4 = -1 is equivalent
