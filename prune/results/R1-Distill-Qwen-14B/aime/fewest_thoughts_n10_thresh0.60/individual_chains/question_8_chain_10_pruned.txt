Okay, so I have this problem here where I need to find the number of triples of nonnegative integers (a, b, c) that satisfy two conditions: a + b + c = 300, and a²b + a²c + b²a + b²c + c²a + c²b = 6,000,000. Hmm, that's a bit intimidating at first glance, but let me break it down.

First, I remember that when dealing with equations involving multiple variables and sums, sometimes it's helpful to consider symmetric expressions or try to find a way to simplify the second equation using the first one. The first equation is straightforward—a linear combination of a, b, and c. The second one is a quadratic times another variable, so it's a bit more complex.

Let me write down the given equations again to have them clear:

1. a + b + c = 300
2. a²b + a²c + b²a + b²c + c²a + c²b = 6,000,000.

Looking at the second equation, I notice that each term is of the form x²y, where x and y are two different variables among a, b, c. So, it's the sum over all permutations where one variable is squared and multiplied by another.

Wait a second, maybe I can factor this somehow. Let me think. If I factor the second equation, perhaps I can express it in terms of (a + b + c) and other symmetric sums. Let me try:

The second expression can be rewritten as:
a²b + a²c + b²a + b²c + c²a + c²b = ab(a + b) + bc(b + c) + ca(c + a).

But I'm not sure if that helps directly. Alternatively, maybe I can factor out something else. Let me see another approach.

I remember that sometimes in symmetric equations, it's helpful to use substitutions based on the elementary symmetric sums. The elementary symmetric sums for three variables a, b, c are:

S1 = a + b + c,
S2 = ab + bc + ca,
S3 = abc.

Given that S1 is given as 300, but I don't know S2 or S3. Maybe I can express the second equation in terms of S1, S2, and S3.

Let me try to manipulate the second equation:

a²b + a²c + b²a + b²c + c²a + c²b.

I can factor each term as a^2(b + c) + b^2(a + c) + c^2(a + b). So:

a²(b + c) + b²(a + c) + c²(a + b).

But since a + b + c = 300, we can substitute (b + c) = 300 - a, (a + c) = 300 - b, and (a + b) = 300 - c.

So, substituting each:

a²(300 - a) + b²(300 - b) + c²(300 - c).

Expanding each term:

= 300a² - a³ + 300b² - b³ + 300c² - c³.

So, the second equation becomes:

300(a² + b² + c²) - (a³ + b³ + c³
