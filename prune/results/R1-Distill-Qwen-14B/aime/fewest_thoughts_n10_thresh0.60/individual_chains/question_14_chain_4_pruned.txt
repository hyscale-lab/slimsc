Okay, so I've got this math problem here, and I need to figure out the greatest four-digit number N. The condition is that if any one of its digits is changed to 1, the resulting number is divisible by 7. Then, I need to find Q + R where Q is the quotient and R is the remainder when N is divided by 1000.

Hmm, let me break this down. First, N is a four-digit number, so it's between 1000 and 9999. I need to find the largest such number with that property. So, I should probably start from 9999 and work my way down until I find a number that fits the condition.

The condition is that changing any single digit to 1 makes the number divisible by 7. So for each digit in N, if I replace it with 1, the new number must be a multiple of 7. That seems pretty restrictive. Let me think about what that implies about N.

Let me denote N as a four-digit number: N = ABCD, where A, B, C, D are its digits. So A is from 1 to 9, and B, C, D are from 0 to 9. Now, if I change A to 1, the number becomes 1BCD. Similarly, changing B to 1 would give A1CD. Changing C to 1 gives AB1D, and changing D to 1 gives ABC1. Each of these four numbers must be divisible by 7.

So, all four modified numbers must be multiples of 7. Therefore, N must be such that changing each digit individually to 1 results in a multiple of 7.

I wonder if there's a way to set up equations based on this. Let me think modulo 7.

Let me consider each case:

1. Changing A to 1: The number becomes 1000 + 100B + 10C + D. Since this is divisible by 7, we have:

1000 + 100B + 10C + D ≡ 0 mod 7.

But 1000 mod 7: Let's compute 1000 / 7. 7*142=994, so 1000 - 994 = 6. So 1000 ≡ 6 mod 7.

Similarly, 100B mod 7: 100 mod 7 is 2, because 7*14=98, so 100-98=2. So 100B ≡ 2B mod 7.

10C mod 7: 10 mod 7 is 3, so 10C ≡ 3C mod 7.

D mod 7 is just D.

So putting it all together:

6 + 2B + 3C + D ≡ 0 mod 7.

That's equation (1).

2. Changing B to 1: The number becomes A1CD, which is 1000A + 100 + 10C + D.

Computing mod 7:

1000A mod 7 is 6A, as before.

100 mod 7 is 2, so 100 ≡ 2 mod 7.

10C mod 7 is 3C.

D mod 7 is D.

So altogether:

6A + 2 + 3C + D ≡ 0 mod 7.

That's equation (2).

3. Changing C to 1: The number becomes AB1D, which is 1000A + 100B + 10 + D.

Modulo 7:

1000A ≡ 6A mod 7.

100B ≡ 2B mod 7.

10 ≡ 3 mod 7.

D ≡ D mod7.

So equation:

6A + 2B + 3 + D ≡ 0 mod 7.

Equation (3).

4. Changing D to 1: The number becomes ABC1, which is 1000A + 100B + 10C + 1.

Modulo 7:

1000A ≡6A, 100B ≡2B, 10C≡3C, and 1 ≡1.

So,

6A + 2B + 3C +1 ≡0 mod7.

Equation (4).

So now, I have four equations:

1. 6 + 2B + 3C + D ≡0 mod7

2. 6A + 2 + 3C + D ≡0 mod7

3. 6A + 2B + 3 + D ≡0 mod7

4. 6A + 2B + 3C +1 ≡0 mod7

I need to solve these equations to find the digits A, B, C, D.

Since N is the greatest four-digit number, we want A to be as large as possible, starting from 9 and going down. So perhaps I can fix A=9 and see if there's a solution, then A=8, etc., until I find the maximum N.

Let me try A=9.

So, substituting A=9 into the equations:

Equation (2): 6*9 + 2 +3C +D ≡0 mod7

6*9=54, 54 mod7: 7*7=49, 54-49=5, so 54≡5 mod7.

So equation (2) becomes 5 + 2 +3C +D ≡0 mod7 → 7 +3C +D ≡0 mod7.

But 7 mod7 is 0, so equation (2) simplifies to 3C + D ≡0 mod7.

Equation (3): 6*9 +2B +3 + D ≡0 mod7

6*9=54≡5 mod7, so 5 + 2B +3 + D ≡0.

5+3=8≡1 mod7, so 2B + D +1 ≡0 → 2B + D ≡6 mod7.

Equation (4): 6*9 +2B +3C +1 ≡0 mod7

54≡5, so 5 +2B +3C +1 ≡0.

5+1=6, so 2B +3C +6 ≡0 → 2B +3C ≡1 mod7.

Equation (1): 6 +2B +3C +D ≡0 mod7.

From equation (1): 2B +3C +D ≡1 mod7, since 6≡6, and 6 + ... ≡0 → ... ≡1 mod7.

Wait, perhaps I should re-express each equation with A=9:

Equation (1): 6 + 2B + 3C + D ≡0 mod7 → (2B + 3C + D) ≡1 mod7.

Equation (2): 3C + D ≡0 mod7.

Equation (3): 2B + D ≡6 mod7.

Equation (4): 2B + 3C ≡1 mod7.

So, let me write down these four equations:

1. 2B + 3C + D ≡1 mod7.

2. 3C + D ≡0 mod7.

3. 2B + D ≡6 mod7.

4. 2B + 3C ≡1 mod7.

Hmm, perhaps I can subtract equation 2 from equation 1.

Equation 1 - Equation 2:

(2B + 3C + D) - (3C + D) ≡1 -0 mod7 → 2B ≡1 mod7.

So 2B ≡1 mod7. So I can solve for B: 2B ≡1 mod7 → multiply both sides by the inverse of 2 mod7. Since 2*4=8≡1 mod7, so inverse is 4.

Thus, B ≡4*1≡4 mod7. Since B is a digit, possible values are 4 or 4+7=11, but B is a single digit, so B=4.

So B=4.

Now, let's substitute B=4 into equation 3: 2*4 + D ≡6 mod7 → 8 + D ≡6 mod7 → 8 mod7 is 1, so 1 + D ≡6 → D ≡5 mod7.

So D can be 5 or 5+7=12, but D is a digit, so D=5.

Now, from equation 2: 3C + D ≡0 mod7 → 3C +5 ≡0 →3C ≡-5 mod7 → 3C≡2 mod7 (since -5=2 mod7).

So 3C≡2 mod7. Let's solve for C.

Multiply both sides by inverse of 3 mod7. 3*5=15≡1 mod7, so inverse is 5.

Thus, C ≡2*5=10≡3 mod7. So C=3 or 3+7=10, but C is a digit, so C=3.

Now, let's check equation 4: 2B +3C ≡1 mod7.

2*4=8≡1 mod7, 3*3=9≡2 mod7. So 1 +2=3≡3 mod7. But equation 4 says it should be ≡1 mod7. 3≡3≠1 mod7. Contradiction.

Hmm, that's a problem. So when A=9, B=4, C=3, D=5, equation 4 isn't satisfied.

So perhaps A=9 doesn't work.

Let me check if I made a mistake.

Wait, equation (4): 2B +3C +1 ≡0 mod7. Wait, no, equation (4) is 6A + 2B +3C +1 ≡0 mod7. With A=9, that's 54 + 2B +3C +1. 54≡5, so 5 + 2B +3C +1≡0 → 6 + 2B +3C≡0 → 2B +3C≡1 mod7.

Which is what I had earlier.

So with B=4, C=3, 2*4=8≡1, 3*3=9≡2. So 1 +2=3≡3 mod7≠1. So equation 4 is not satisfied. So A=9 is not possible.

Thus, perhaps A=8.

Proceeding similarly, but this might take a long time. Maybe there's a better way.

Alternatively, perhaps we can set up the equations more cleverly.

From equation 2: 3C + D ≡0 mod7 → D ≡ -3C mod7.

Equation 3: 2B + D ≡6 mod7.

Substituting D from equation 2: 2B -3C ≡6 mod7.

Equation 4: 2B +3C ≡1 mod7.

So, from equation 4: 2B +3C ≡1 mod7.

Let me write:

Equation 4: 2B +3C ≡1.

Equation 3a: 2B -3C ≡6.

Let me add equations 4 and 3a:

(2B +3C) + (2B -3C) ≡1 +6 →4B ≡7 mod7 →4B≡0 mod7.

Thus, 4B≡0 mod7 → B≡0 mod7, since 4 and 7 are coprime. So B must be 0 mod7. But B is a digit (0-9), so possible B=0 or 7.

So B=0 or 7.

Wait, but earlier with A=9, we found B=4, but perhaps A is being adjusted now. So perhaps for A=8, B could be 0 or 7.

Wait, let me check. So for any A, B must be 0 or 7 mod7, so B=0 or7.

So possible B=0 or7.

Let me proceed with A=9 again, but this time, since equation 4 requires 2B +3C
