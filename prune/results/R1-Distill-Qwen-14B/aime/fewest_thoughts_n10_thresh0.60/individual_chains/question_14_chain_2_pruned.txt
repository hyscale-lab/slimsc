Okay, so I have this math problem here, and I need to figure out the greatest four-digit number N with a specific property. The property is that if you change any one of its digits to 1, the resulting number is divisible by 7. Then, I need to find Q + R where Q is the quotient when N is divided by 1000 and R is the remainder.

Let me break this down. First, I need to find N, which is a four-digit number, so it's between 1000 and 9999. The condition is that changing any single digit to 1 makes the number divisible by 7. That means, for each digit in N, replacing it with 1 should result in a multiple of 7.

So, for example, if N is ABCD (where A, B, C, D are digits), then changing A to 1 gives 1BCD, changing B to 1 gives A1CD, changing C to 1 gives AB1D, and changing D to 1 gives ABC1. Each of these four numbers must be divisible by 7.

Since we're looking for the greatest such four-digit number, it's logical to start checking from 9999 downwards until we find a number that satisfies this condition. But that might take a long time, so maybe there's a smarter approach.

Let me think about the structure of N. Each digit can be changed to 1, resulting in a number divisible by 7. Let's denote N as a four-digit number: N = a b c d, where a, b, c, d are digits, and a ≠ 0.

So, changing each digit one by one to 1 gives four new numbers:

1. Changing a to 1: 1 b c d
2. Changing b to 1: a 1 c d
3. Changing c to 1: a b 1 d
4. Changing d to 1: a b c 1

Each of these four numbers must be divisible by 7.

So, for each of these four numbers, let's write the divisibility condition.

Divisibility by 7: A number is divisible by 7 if, when you double the last digit, subtract it from the rest of the number, the result is divisible by 7. But maybe it's easier to consider modulo 7.

Alternatively, for a number x, x mod 7 should equal 0.

So, let's model this.

Let N = 1000a + 100b + 10c + d.

When we change a to 1: 1000*1 + 100b + 10c + d = 1000 + 100b + 10c + d. This must be divisible by 7.

Similarly, changing b to 1: 1000a + 100*1 + 10c + d = 1000a + 100 + 10c + d. Divisible by 7.

Changing c to 1: 1000a + 100b + 10*1 + d = 1000a + 100b + 10 + d. Divisible by 7.

Changing d to 1: 1000a + 100b + 10c + 1. Divisible by 7.

So, each of these four expressions must be congruent to 0 mod 7.

Let me write these conditions:

1. 1000 + 100b + 10c + d ≡ 0 mod 7
2. 1000a + 100 + 10c + d ≡ 0 mod 7
3. 1000a + 100b + 10 + d ≡ 0 mod 7
4. 1000a + 100b + 10c + 1 ≡ 0 mod 7

Hmm, that's four congruences. Maybe I can find relations between them.

Also, note that N = 1000a + 100b + 10c + d. So, N ≡ 0 mod 7? Wait, is it necessary? Because when you change a digit to 1, the number is divisible by 7, but N itself doesn't have to be. Let me check that.

Wait, no. Because when you change a digit to 1, the number becomes divisible by 7, but N itself isn't necessarily. So N's value mod 7 is not directly given, but each modified version is 0 mod 7.

But perhaps I can express each modified number in terms of N.

Let me see:

1. Changing a to 1: 1000 + 100b + 10c + d = 1000 + (N - a*1000)/1. Because N is 1000a + 100b + 10c + d, so N - a*1
