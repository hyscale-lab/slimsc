Okay, let me try to figure out this probability problem step by step. So, Jen is entering a lottery where she picks 4 distinct numbers from the set S = {1,2,3,...,9,10}. Then, 4 numbers are randomly chosen from S. She wins a prize if at least two of her numbers match the randomly chosen ones, and she wins the grand prize if all four of her numbers match.

The question is asking for the probability that she wins the grand prize given that she won a prize. They mention that this probability is m/n where m and n are coprime, and we need to find m + n.

Hmm, okay. So, this is a conditional probability problem. The formula for conditional probability is P(A|B) = P(A ∩ B) / P(B). In this case, event A is winning the grand prize, and event B is winning a prize. So, P(A|B) is the probability that she won the grand prize given that she won a prize.

But wait, if she wins the grand prize, she must have all four numbers correct. So, winning the grand prize is a subset of winning a prize. That means A ∩ B is just A, because if you win the grand prize, you automatically win a prize. So, P(A ∩ B) is just P(A).

So, the formula simplifies to P(A|B) = P(A) / P(B). Therefore, we need to find the probability of winning the grand prize, which is the probability that all four of her numbers are chosen, and divide that by the probability of winning a prize, which is the probability that at least two of her numbers are chosen.

Let me write that down:

P(A|B) = P(A) / P(B)

So, first, let's compute P(A), the probability of winning the grand prize. That's the probability that all four of her numbers are selected. Since the lottery chooses 4 numbers out of 10, the total number of possible combinations is C(10,4), which is 210. The number of favorable outcomes for the grand prize is just 1, because there's only one specific set of four numbers that Jen has. So, P(A) = 1 / C(10,4) = 1 / 210.

Wait, no, wait. Wait a second. Because when we compute probabilities in lotteries like this, it's often about the number of favorable combinations over the total number. So, the total possible ways the lottery can pick 4 numbers is C(10,4) = 210.

The number of favorable combinations for the grand prize is 1, as there's only one set that matches Jen's numbers. So, P(A) = 1 / 210.

Now, let's compute P(B), the probability of winning a prize, which is the probability that at least two of her numbers are chosen in the lottery. So, "at least two" includes the cases where exactly two, exactly three, or exactly four of her numbers are chosen.

Alternatively, it's easier to compute P(B) as 1 minus the probability of winning no prize. Winning no prize would mean that none or only one of Jen's numbers are chosen.

So, P(B) = 1 - [P(0 correct) + P(1 correct)].

Let me compute P(0 correct): the number of ways to choose 4 numbers from the 10, none of which are in Jen's set. Since Jen has 4 numbers, the remaining numbers are 10 - 4 = 6. So, the number of ways to choose 4 numbers from
