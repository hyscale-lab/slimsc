Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the number of intersections between two graphs. The equations are a bit complicated, so I'll try to break them down step by step.

The first function is y = 4 g(f(sin(2πx))), and the second equation is x = 4 g(f(cos(3πy))). I need to find how many points (x, y) satisfy both equations. That means I need to solve for x and y such that both equations are true simultaneously.

Let me first understand what f(x) and g(x) are. The function f(x) is defined as ||x| - 1/2|. Similarly, g(x) is ||x| - 1/4|. These are both absolute value functions, and they create V-shaped graphs with possible multiple bends because of the double absolute values.

Let me try to visualize f(x) first. The inner part is |x|, which is a V-shape with its vertex at (0,0). Then subtracting 1/2: |x| - 1/2 would shift this V down by 1/2 unit. The absolute value of that would reflect any negative parts back up. So, f(x) = ||x| - 1/2|. Let me find the points where f(x) is zero.

Setting f(x) = 0: ||x| - 1/2| = 0. So |x| - 1/2 = 0, which gives |x| = 1/2, so x = 1/2 or x = -1/2. So the graph of f(x) touches the x-axis at x = ±1/2.

Similarly, for g(x) = ||x| - 1/4|: Setting g(x) = 0 gives |x| = 1/4, so x = ±1/4.

Now, I should probably sketch or understand the behavior of these functions. For f(x), the original V is at (0,0), but after shifting down by 1/2 and taking absolute value, it creates a W shape with minima at x = ±1/2 and going up on either side.

Wait, no. Let me think again. Let me compute f(x) at various points.

For f(x):

When x is 0: f(0) = |0 - 1/2| = 1/2.

When x is 1/2: f(1/2) = |1/2 - 1/2| = 0.

When x is 1: f(1) = |1 - 1/2| = 1/2.

Similarly for x = -1/2 and x = -1, same values.

So f(x) is a V-shape that has minima at x = ±1/2 (value 0) and peaks at x=0, x=±1, etc., with value 1/2.

Similarly, for g(x):

At x=0: g(0) = |0 - 1/4| = 1/4.

At x=1/4: g(1/4) = 0.

At x=1/2: g(1/2) = |1/2 - 1/4| = 1/4.

So g(x) has a V-shape, minima at x=±1/4, and peaks at x=0, ±1/2, etc., with value 1/4.

Okay, so now both f and g are functions that have these V-shapes with certain periods.

Now, the functions inside the main equations are compositions of these functions. The first equation is y = 4 g(f(sin(2πx))), and the second is x = 4 g(f(cos(3πy))).

I need to find all (x, y) such that both equations are satisfied. So, perhaps I can substitute y from the first equation into the second equation, but given that equations are interdependent, it might get a bit complicated.

Wait, let's write down both equations:

Equation 1: y = 4 g(f(sin(2πx)))

Equation 2: x = 4 g(f(cos(3πy)))

So, to find their intersection points, I need to find (x, y) where both equations hold. Since equation 1 gives y in terms of x, I can substitute that into equation 2, but equation 2 gives x in terms of y, which would be a bit circular.

Alternatively, maybe it's better to analyze the possible ranges and periodicities of these functions.

Let me consider the inner functions first.

Consider f(sin(2πx)).

Since sin(2πx) has a period of 1 (because sin(2πx +
