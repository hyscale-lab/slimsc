Okay, so I have this problem about a convex equilateral hexagon where all pairs of opposite sides are parallel. The triangle formed by extending the sides AB, CD, and EF has side lengths of 200, 240, and 300. I need to find the side length of the hexagon.

Hmm, let me start by visualizing the hexagon. Since it's equilateral, all its sides are equal in length, let's call that length 's'. Also, the opposite sides are parallel, so it's like a regular hexagon but maybe stretched or something. But it's convex, so all the internal angles are less than 180 degrees.

The triangle formed by extending AB, CD, and EF. So AB, CD, EF are three sides of the hexagon, and when extended, they form a triangle. The sides of this triangle are 200, 240, and 300.

Wait, so if I imagine the hexagon, each pair of opposite sides is parallel. So, sides AB and DE are parallel, BC and EF are parallel, and CD and FA are parallel. Or maybe I have that wrong? Let me confirm.

Wait, the problem says all pairs of opposite sides are parallel. So, for a hexagon ABCDEF, the opposite sides would be AB and DE, BC and EF, CD and FA. Yes, that's right.

Now, when we extend AB, CD, and EF, these three lines meet to form a triangle. Let me think how that would look. Extending AB, which is one side, CD, another side, and EF, which is another side. Since AB and CD are not necessarily adjacent, but in a convex hexagon, their extensions should form a larger triangle encompassing the hexagon.

Wait, let me sketch this mentally. The hexagon is inside this triangle, and each side of the triangle is formed by the extension of AB, CD, and EF. So, the triangle is a sort of 'outer' triangle relative to the hexagon.

Since the hexagon is equilateral with side length 's', each side is length 's'. But the triangle has sides 200, 240, 300. Hmm.

I think this problem relates to similar triangles or perhaps the concept of similar triangles in the context of the hexagon.

Wait, in a convex hexagon with opposite sides parallel, the distances between the opposite sides are proportional to the side lengths of the triangle formed by extending those sides.

Alternatively, maybe we can model the hexagon as a result of cutting off three smaller triangles from the larger triangle. Since the triangle has sides 200, 240, 300, perhaps each of the three sides of the hexagon is a portion of each side of this triangle.

Wait, another approach: Let's think of the triangle being divided into smaller sections by the hexagon. Since all sides of the hexagon are equal, the lengths cut from each side of the triangle by the hexagon should be equal in some proportion.

Wait, maybe I can use the concept of similar triangles and the intercept theorem (also known as Thales' theorem). The idea is that if a line is drawn parallel to one side of a triangle, it divides the other two sides proportionally.

But in this case, the hexagon is such that each pair of opposite sides is parallel. So each side of the hexagon is part of a line that's parallel to another side. So, for example, AB is parallel to DE, which is another side of the hexagon.

Wait, perhaps each side of the triangle 200, 240, 300 is being cut by two sides of the hexagon. Each side of the triangle would have two segments corresponding to the hexagon's sides.

Wait, let's denote the triangle as triangle XYZ, with sides XY = 200, YZ = 240, XZ = 300. Then, the hexagon ABCDEF is inscribed in triangle XYZ such that each pair of opposite sides of the hexagon is parallel to each other and cuts the sides of triangle XYZ.

Wait, but ABCDEF is a convex hexagon, so it's inside XYZ, and each side of the hexagon is a part of a line segment parallel to another side.

Wait, maybe the hexagon can be thought of as a result of three cuts made on the triangle, each cut parallel to one side of the triangle. Each cut would create a smaller, similar triangle inside, and the hexagon is what's left between these cuts.

But in this case,
