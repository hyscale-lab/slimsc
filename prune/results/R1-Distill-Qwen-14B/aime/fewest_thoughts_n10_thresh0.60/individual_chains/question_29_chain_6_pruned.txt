Okay, so I'm trying to solve this geometry problem. Let me try to visualize it first. There are two rectangles, ABCD and EFGH. Points D, E, C, F are collinear. So, they lie on a straight line. Also, points A, D, H, G all lie on a circle. Hmm, that might be important later.

Given lengths: BC = 16, AB = 107, FG = 17, and EF = 184. We need to find the length of CE.

First off, since ABCD is a rectangle, opposite sides are equal and all angles are right angles. So, AB = CD = 107, BC = AD = 16. Similarly, EFGH is a rectangle, so FG = EH = 17, EF = GH = 184.

Let me sketch a rough diagram in my mind. Let's assume ABCD is positioned such that AB is the base, BC is the height. So, point A is bottom-left, B is bottom-right, C is top-right, D is top-left. Then, EFGH is another rectangle. Since D, E, C, F are collinear, that line must be the same as DC, but wait, DC is a side of ABCD. Hmm, but E and F are part of EFGH.

Wait, maybe the line containing D, E, C, F is a straight line that extends beyond DC. So, perhaps EF is an extension beyond C, making CE part of that line.

Wait, but D, E, C, F are collinear. So, starting from D, going through E, then through C, then through F. So, the order is D, E, C, F on a straight line.

Given that, E is somewhere between D and C, or is C between D and E? Hmm, the problem states D, E, C, F are collinear, so the order is D, E, C, F on the line.

So, the line starts at D, goes through E, then C, then F.

Now, considering the rectangles ABCD and EFGH. Let's consider the coordinates to model this.

Let me assign coordinates to the points to make it easier. Let's place point D at the origin (0,0). Since ABCD is a rectangle, and AB = 107, BC = 16. So, the coordinates would be:

- D: (0, 0)
- C: (107, 0) because DC is equal to AB, which is 107.
- B: (107, 16)
- A: (0, 16)

Wait, no. Wait, ABCD is a rectangle, so AB is the base, BC is the height. So, if D is at (0,0), then C is at (x, y). Wait, perhaps a better way is to have D at (0,0), and since ABCD is a rectangle, moving right to C. So, DC is the side opposite to AB, so DC should be equal in length to AB, which is 107, and BC is 16, so the height.

So, point D is (0,0). Then, point C is (
