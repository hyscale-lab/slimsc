Okay, so I have this math problem to solve, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read the problem again and try to understand what's being asked.

Every morning, Aya goes for a 9-kilometer-long walk and stops at a coffee shop afterwards. When she walks at a constant speed of s kilometers per hour, the walk takes her 4 hours, including t minutes spent in the coffee shop. When she increases her speed to s+2 kilometers per hour, the walk takes her 2 hours and 24 minutes, including the same t minutes in the coffee shop. Now, the question is, if she walks at s + 1/2 kilometers per hour, how many minutes will the walk take her, including t minutes in the coffee shop?

Alright, so the key points here are that the distance is constant at 9 km, but her speed changes, and consequently, the time she takes changes. The time includes both the walking time and the coffee shop time, which is t minutes, but it's the same in both cases. So, t is a constant value in both scenarios.

First, let's break down the information given.

Case 1: Speed = s km/h. Total time taken = 4 hours, which includes walking time plus t minutes.

Case 2: Speed = s + 2 km/h. Total time taken = 2 hours and 24 minutes, which again includes walking time plus t minutes.

We need to find the total time when her speed is s + 1/2 km/h.

So, I think the approach here is to find the values of s and t first. Once we have s and t, we can compute the total time for the new speed.

Let me write down the equations based on the information.

In Case 1:

Walking time + coffee time = total time.

Walking time = distance / speed = 9 / s hours.

Coffee time = t minutes, which is t/60 hours.

So, the equation becomes:

9/s + t/60 = 4.  [Equation 1]

In Case 2:

Walking time = 9 / (s + 2) hours.

Coffee time is same, t/60 hours.

Total time is 2 hours and 24 minutes. Let's convert that to hours. 24 minutes is 24/60 = 0.4 hours, so total time is 2.4 hours.

So, equation 2 is:

9/(s + 2) + t/60 = 2.4.  [Equation 2]

Now, I have two equations with two variables, s and t. I can solve these two equations to find s and t.

Let me subtract equation 2 from equation 1 to eliminate t.

Equation 1: 9/s + t/60 = 4

Equation 2: 9/(s+2) + t/60 = 2.4

Subtract equation 2 from equation 1:

[9/s + t/60] - [9/(s+2) + t/60] = 4 - 2.4

Simplify left side:

9/s - 9/(s+2) + t/60 - t/60 = 1.6

So, t/60 cancels out, and we have:

9/s - 9/(s+2) = 1.6

Let's factor out the 9:

9 [1/s - 1/(s+2)] = 1.6

Compute 1/s - 1/(s+2):

[ (s + 2) - s ] / [s(s+2)] = 2 / [s(s+2)]

So, 9 * [2 / (s(s+2))] = 1.6

So, 18 / [s(s+2)] = 1.6

Let me write that as:

18 = 1.6 * s(s + 2)

Compute 1.6 * s(s + 2):

1.6 s^2 + 3.2 s

So,

18 = 1.6 s^2 + 3.2 s

Let me rearrange this as:

1.6 s^2 + 3.2 s - 18 = 0

Hmm, dealing with decimals can be a bit messy. Maybe I can multiply both sides by 10 to eliminate the decimal.

16 s^2 + 32 s - 180 = 0

Simplify by dividing all terms by 4:

4 s^2 + 8 s - 45 = 0

Now, this is a quadratic equation in s. Let's solve for s using the quadratic formula.

The quadratic equation is 4s² + 8s -45 = 0.

The quadratic formula is s = [-b ± sqrt(b² - 4ac)] / (2a)

Here, a = 4, b = 8, c = -45.

Compute discriminant D:

D = b² - 4ac = (8)^2 - 4*(4)*(-45) = 64 + 720 = 784

Square root of 784 is 28.

So,

s = [ -8 ± 28 ] / (2 * 4) = [ -8 ± 28 ] / 8

So, two possible solutions:

s = (-8 + 28)/8 = 20/8 = 2.5

s = (-8 -28)/8 = (-36)/8 = -4.5

Since speed cannot be negative, we discard s = -4.5.

Thus, s = 2.5 km/h.

Now that I have s, I can find t from equation 1.

Equation 1: 9/s + t/60 = 4

Plug in s = 2.5:

9 / 2.5 + t/60 = 4

Compute 9 / 2.5:

9 divided by 2.5 is the same as 9 * (2/5) since 2.5 is 5/2.

Wait, no, 2.5 is 5/2, so 9 / (5/2) = 9 * (2/5) = 18/5 = 3.6 hours.

So,

3.6 + t/60 = 4

Subtract 3.6 from both sides:

t/60 = 4 - 3.6 = 0.4

Multiply both sides by 60:

t = 0.4 * 60 = 24 minutes.

So, t is 24 minutes.

Now, the problem asks, what is the total time when Aya walks at s + 1/2 km/h?

First, compute s + 1/2:

s = 2.5, so s + 1/2 = 2.5 + 0.5 = 3.0 km/h.

So, her speed is 3 km/h.

Now, compute the walking time: distance is 9 km, speed is 3 km/h.

Walking time = 9 / 3 = 3 hours.

But wait, that's just the walking time. The total time includes t minutes in the coffee shop, which is 24 minutes.

So, total time is 3 hours + 24 minutes.

Convert 3 hours to minutes: 180 minutes.

So, 180 + 24 = 204 minutes.

Wait, but the question says to include t minutes in the walk time. So, yes, that's correct.

But just to make sure, let's double-check the calculations.

s = 2.5 km/h, so s + 1/2 = 3.0 km/h.

Walking time = 9 km / 3 km/h = 3 hours.

Plus t =24 minutes, so 3 hours 24 minutes total. Which is 3*60 +24= 180+24=204 minutes.

Yes, that seems correct.

Wait, but let me just make sure that with s =2.5
