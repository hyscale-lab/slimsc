Okay, so I've got this probability problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me try to understand what's being asked.

Jen is entering a lottery by picking 4 distinct numbers from the set S = {1,2,3,...,10}. Then, 4 numbers are randomly chosen from S. She wins a prize if at least two of her numbers match two of the randomly chosen numbers. She wins the grand prize if all four of her numbers are the ones chosen. The question is about the probability of her winning the grand prize given that she won a prize. They mention this probability is m/n where m and n are coprime, and we have to find m + n.

Hmm, okay. So this is a conditional probability question. I remember that conditional probability is about the probability of an event given that another event has occurred. The formula is P(A|B) = P(A ∩ B) / P(B). So in this case, event A is winning the grand prize, and event B is winning any prize. So we need to find P(A|B) which is the probability of winning the grand prize given that she has won a prize.

Breaking it down, P(A ∩ B) is actually just P(A), because if she wins the grand prize, she must have won a prize. So that simplifies to P(A) divided by P(B), where P(B) is the probability of winning any prize.

So, first, I need to find P(A), the probability that she wins the grand prize. Then, I need to find P(B), the probability that she wins at least two numbers. Then, divide P(A) by P(B), and simplify the fraction to get m/n.

Let me tackle P(A) first. The grand prize is when all four of her numbers are chosen. So, how many ways are there to choose 4 numbers from 10? That's the combination of 10 choose 4, which is the total number of possible outcomes. Since Jen picks 4 specific numbers, the number of favorable outcomes is 1 (only one set of four numbers is her chosen set). So P(A) is 1 divided by the total number of ways to choose 4 numbers from 10.

Calculating that, 10 choose 4 is (10!)/(4! * (10-4)!) = (10*9*8*7)/(4*3*2*1) = 210. So P(A) = 1/210.

Okay, now I need to find P(B), the probability that she wins a prize, which is when at least two of her numbers are chosen. So, in other words, when two, three, or all four of her numbers are among the four chosen.

I think the standard way to calculate this is by using the complement: instead of calculating the probability of at least two matches, calculate the probability of fewer than two matches (i.e., zero or one matches) and subtract that from 1.

So, P(B) = 1 - P(zero matches) - P(exactly one match).

Let me compute each part.

First, the total number of possible ways the lottery can choose 4 numbers is still 10 choose 4 = 210.

Now, P(zero matches): this is the probability that none of her four numbers are chosen. So, the number of ways to choose 4 numbers from the 10 that are not her numbers. Since she has 4 numbers, there are 10 - 4 = 6 numbers she didn't pick. So, the number of ways to choose 4 numbers from these 6 is 6 choose 4.

Calculating 6 choose 4: 15. So the number of ways she can have zero matches is 15. Therefore, P(zero matches) = 15 / 210.

Next, P(exactly one match): this is the number of ways to choose exactly one of her four numbers and three numbers from the remaining six.

So, the number of ways is 4 choose 1 (to pick one of her numbers) multiplied by 6 choose 3 (to pick three from the non-her numbers).

Calculating 4 choose 1 is 4. 6 choose 3 is (6!)/(3! * 3!) = 20. So, 4 * 20 = 80.

Therefore, the number of ways for exactly one match is 80. So, P(exactly one match) = 80 / 210.

So, putting it together, P(B) = 1 - (15/210 + 80/210) = 1 - (95/210).

Calculating 95 + 80 +15= 95? Wait, no: 15 +80 =95, yes. So, 95/210 is the probability of zero or one matches. So, P(B) = 1 - 95/210 = (210 -95)/210 = 115/210.

Wait, is that right? Let me think again. P(B) is the probability of at least two matches, so yes, 1 - P(zero) - P(one) = 1 - 15/210 -80/210= 115/210.

Simplify 115/210: both are divisible by 5. 115 ÷5=23, 210 ÷5=42. So, 23/42. So P(B)=23/42.

Wait, let me double-check: 15 (zero) +80 (one)=95. 210-95=115, correct. 115/210 simplifies to 23/42. Yes.

So, P(A) is 1/210, and P(B) is 23/42. So the conditional
