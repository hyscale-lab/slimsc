      "full_content": "Okay, so I'm trying to solve this problem where there's a hyperbola given by the equation x\u00b2/20 - y\u00b2/24 = 1. Points A, B, C, and D lie on this hyperbola, forming a rhombus ABCD. The diagonals of this rhombus intersect at the origin. I need to find the greatest real number that is less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi. Hmm, that sounds a bit complicated, but let me break it down.\n\nFirst, I remember that a rhombus has all sides equal and its diagonals bisect each other at right angles. Wait, no, actually, in a rhombus, the diagonals bisect each other and bisect the angles, but they aren't necessarily perpendicular unless it's a square. Wait, is that right? I think in a rhombus, the diagonals are not perpendicular, but wait, no, actually, I'm confusing with a kite. Let me think. No, in a rhombus, the diagonals are perpendicular. Yeah, correct, every rhombus is a special kind of kite where all sides are equal, and the diagonals are perpendicular bisectors of each other. So, the diagonals intersect at 90 degrees.\n\nBut in this problem, it's given that the diagonals intersect at the origin, which is the center of the hyperbola. So, the diagonals pass through the origin, and they are perpendicular to each other because it's a rhombus.\n\nSo, let me model this. Since the diagonals intersect at the origin, which is also the center of the hyperbola, the diagonals must be lines passing through the origin. Let's denote the two diagonals as AC and BD. Since they are perpendicular, their slopes must be negative reciprocals of each other.\n\nLet me assign coordinates to the points. Since the diagonals intersect at the origin, if point A is at (p, q), then point C, being the opposite vertex, must be at (-p, -q) because the diagonals bisect each other. Similarly, if point B is at (r, s), then point D will be at (-r, -s).\n\nNow, since ABCD is a rhombus, all sides are equal. So, the distance from A to B must equal the distance from B to C, which must equal the distance from C to D, and so on.\n\nBut another approach is to use the properties of the rhombus in terms of its diagonals. In a rhombus, the diagonals are perpendicular and bisect each other. Moreover, the area of the rhombus can be expressed as (AC * BD)/2. But I'm not sure if area is directly useful here.\n\nSince the diagonals intersect at the origin, their equations can be represented as lines through the origin. Let me denote the diagonal AC as having a slope m, so its equation is y = m x. Then, since BD is perpendicular to AC, its equation must be y = (-1/m) x.\n\nNow, the points A and C lie on the line y = m x, and points B and D lie on the line y = (-1/m) x.\n\nSince all four points A, B, C, D lie on the hyperbola x\u00b2/20 - y\u00b2/24 = 1, let me substitute the coordinates of these points into the hyperbola equation.\n\nStarting with point A: (p, q) lies on the hyperbola, so p\u00b2/20 - q\u00b2/24 = 1. But since point A is on the line y = m x, q = m p. So, substituting q in terms of p, we get p\u00b2/20 - (m\u00b2 p\u00b2)/24 = 1.\n\nSimplify that equation: p\u00b2 (1/20 - m\u00b2/24) = 1.\n\nSimilarly, for point B: (r, s) lies on the hyperbola, so r\u00b2/20 - s\u00b2/24 = 1. Since point B is on y = (-1/m) x, s = (-1/m) r. Substituting, r\u00b2/20 - ( (1/m\u00b2) r\u00b2 ) /24 = 1.\n\nSimplify: r\u00b2 (1/20 - 1/(24 m\u00b2)) = 1.\n\nSo, both points A and B lie on the hyperbola, each satisfying similar equations with their respective lines. Let's solve for p\u00b2 and r\u00b2.\n\nFor point A:\n\np\u00b2 (1/20 - m\u00b2/24) = 1\n\nSo, p\u00b2 = 1 / (1/20 - m\u00b2/24) = 1 / [ (12 - 5 m\u00b2)/120 ] = 120 / (12 - 5 m\u00b2 )\n\nSimilarly, for point B:\n\nr\u00b2 (1/20 - 1/(24 m\u00b2)) = 1\n\nSimplify the coefficient:\n\n1/20 - 1/(24 m\u00b2) = (12 m\u00b2 - 5) / (240 m\u00b2 )\n\nSo, r\u00b2 = 1 / ( (12 m\u00b2 - 5)/(240 m\u00b2) ) ) = 240 m\u00b2 / (12 m\u00b2 - 5 )\n\nNow, since ABCD is a rhombus, the lengths of the sides must be equal. Let's compute the length of AB and set it equal to the length of BC or something else. But maybe another approach is better.\n\nAlternatively, in a rhombus, the diagonals are perpendicular and the sides can be found using the lengths of the diagonals. If the lengths of the diagonals are d1 and d2, then each side of the rhombus is (sqrt( (d1/2)^2 + (d2/2)^2 )).\n\nIn our case, the diagonals are AC and BD. Let me compute the lengths of these diagonals in terms of m.\n\nThe length of diagonal AC is the distance between points A(p, q) and C(-p, -q). That distance is sqrt( (2p)^2 + (2q)^2 ) = 2 sqrt(p^2 + q^2 ). Similarly, the length of BD is 2 sqrt(r^2 + s^2 ).\n\nBut since A is (p, q) on y = m x, q = m p. So, sqrt(p^2 + q^2 ) = sqrt(p\u00b2 + m\u00b2 p\u00b2 ) = p sqrt(1 + m\u00b2 ). So, the length of AC is 2 p sqrt(1 + m\u00b2 ). Similarly, for BD, since s = (-1/m) r, sqrt(r^2 + s^2 ) = sqrt(r\u00b2 + (1/m\u00b2) r\u00b2 ) = r sqrt(1 + 1/m\u00b2 ). So, length of BD is 2 r sqrt(1 + 1/m\u00b2 ).\n\nBut in a rhombus, the diagonals satisfy the relationship: (d1)^2 + (d2)^2 = 4 * (side length)^2. Wait, actually, in a rhombus, each side can be calculated as (d1/2)^2 + (d2/2)^2 = (side)^2. So, (AC/2)^2 + (BD/2)^2 = (side)^2. Therefore, (AC)^2 + (BD)^2 = 4 (side)^2.\n\nBut perhaps it's better to use the fact that in a rhombus, the diagonals are perpendicular, so the area is (AC * BD)/2, and also the area can be expressed as side^2 * sin(theta), where theta is any interior angle. But maybe that's more complicated.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using coordinates, I can compute the vectors AB and AD and set their lengths equal.\n\nLet me try that. Let's compute vectors AB and AD.\n\nPoint A is (p, q), point B is (r, s), point D is (-r, -s).\n\nVector AB = (r - p, s - q)\n\nVector AD = (-r - p, -s - q )\n\nThe lengths of AB and AD must be equal:\n\nSo, sqrt( (r - p)^2 + (s - q)^2 ) = sqrt( (-r - p)^2 + (-s - q)^2 )\n\nSquaring both sides:\n\n(r - p)^2 + (s - q)^2 = (-r - p)^2 + (-s - q)^2\n\nExpanding both sides:\n\nLeft side: (r\u00b2 - 2 p r + p\u00b2 ) + (s\u00b2 - 2 q s + q\u00b2 )\n\nRight side: (r\u00b2 + 2 p r + p\u00b2 ) + (s\u00b2 + 2 q s + q\u00b2 )\n\nSubtracting right side from left side:\n\n[ (r\u00b2 - 2 p r + p\u00b2 ) + (s\u00b2 - 2 q s + q\u00b2 ) ] - [ (r\u00b2 + 2 p r + p\u00b2 ) + (s\u00b2 + 2 q s + q\u00b2 ) ] = 0\n\nSimplify term by term:\n\nr\u00b2 - 2 p r + p\u00b2 + s\u00b2 - 2 q s + q\u00b2 - r\u00b2 - 2 p r - p\u00b2 - s\u00b2 - 2 q s - q\u00b2 = 0\n\nSo:\n\n-4 p r -4 q s = 0\n\nWhich simplifies to:\n\np r + q s = 0\n\nSo, equation (1): p r + q s = 0\n\nBut since we have points A(p, q) on y = m x and B(r, s) on y = (-1/m) x, let's substitute q = m p and s = (-1/m) r.\n\nSubstituting into equation (1):\n\np r + (m p) * ( (-1/m) r ) = 0\n\nSimplify:\n\np r + ( - p r ) = 0\n\nWhich gives:\n\n( p r - p r ) = 0 => 0 = 0\n\nHmm, so this condition is automatically satisfied. That makes sense because the points are chosen such that the diagonals are perpendicular and intersect at the origin, so the sides will naturally be equal in length.\n\nSo perhaps this doesn't give us any new information. Maybe I need another condition.\n\nAnother approach: Since ABCD is a rhombus, the midpoint of the diagonals must coincide, which they do at the origin. So, the coordinates are set up correctly.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can express BD\u00b2 in terms of m and find its minimal value, but wait, the problem is asking for the greatest real number that is less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi. So, that would be the infimum of BD\u00b2. So, the minimal possible BD\u00b2 is the lower bound, and the answer would be the supremum of all such lower bounds, which is the minimal BD\u00b2 across all possible rhombi.\n\nWait, no, the problem says the greatest real number less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi. So, it's like the infimum of BD\u00b2. Because for all rhombi, BD\u00b2 is greater than some number, and we want the largest such number. So, we need to find the minimal possible BD\u00b2, which is the infimum, and that's the number we need.\n\nSo, if I can find the minimal possible BD\u00b2, that would be the greatest lower bound.\n\nSo, let me express BD\u00b2 in terms of m, and then find its minimum.\n\nEarlier, I found that the length of BD is 2 r sqrt(1 + 1/m\u00b2 ). So, BD squared is [2 r sqrt(1 + 1/m\u00b2 )]^2 = 4 r\u00b2 (1 + 1/m\u00b2 )\n\nSimilarly, from point B, we had r\u00b2 = 240 m\u00b2 / (12 m\u00b2 - 5 )\n\nSo, substitute:\n\nBD\u00b2 = 4 * (240 m\u00b2 / (12 m\u00b2 - 5 )) * (1 + 1/m\u00b2 )\n\nSimplify 1 + 1/m\u00b2 = (m\u00b2 + 1 ) / m\u00b2\n\nSo,\n\nBD\u00b2 = 4 * (240 m\u00b2 / (12 m\u00b2 -5 )) * ( (m\u00b2 + 1 ) / m\u00b2 )\n\nSimplify:\n\nBD\u00b2 = 4 * (240 m\u00b2 * (m\u00b2 + 1 )) / ( (12 m\u00b2 -5 ) m\u00b2 )\n\nThe m\u00b2 terms cancel:\n\nBD\u00b2 = 4 * 240 (m\u00b2 + 1 ) / (12 m\u00b2 -5 )\n\nCompute 4 * 240 = 960\n\nSo,\n\nBD\u00b2 = 960 (m\u00b2 + 1 ) / (12 m\u00b2 -5 )\n\nNow, our task reduces to finding the minimal value of BD\u00b2 as m varies over all real numbers where the hyperbola and the lines intersect.\n\nBut we need to find the minimal BD\u00b2, so we can treat BD\u00b2 as a function of m\u00b2. Let me set t = m\u00b2. Since m is real and non-zero (because if m=0, the line y=0, which is the x-axis, but then s = (-1/m) r would be undefined), so m can't be zero. So, t > 0.\n\nSo, express BD\u00b2 in terms of t:\n\nBD\u00b2(t) = 960 (t + 1 ) / (12 t -5 )\n\nWe need to find the minimum of this function for t such that the points are on the hyperbola.\n\nWait, but we have to make sure that the denominators in the expressions for p\u00b2 and r\u00b2 are non-zero and that the points lie on the hyperbola. So, for points A and B to lie on the hyperbola, the denominators in p\u00b2 and r\u00b2 must be non-zero.\n\nLooking back, for point A:\n\np\u00b2 = 120 / (12 -5 t )\n\nSo, 12 -5 t \u2260 0 => t \u2260 12/5 = 2.4\n\nSimilarly, for point B:\n\nr\u00b2 = 240 t / (12 t -5 )\n\nSo, denominator 12 t -5 \u22600 => t \u22605/12 \u22480.4167\n\nTherefore, t must satisfy t \u22605/12 and t \u226012/5.\n\nMoreover, the expressions for p\u00b2 and r\u00b2 must be positive because they are squared terms.\n\nSo,\n\nFor p\u00b2: 120 / (12 -5 t ) > 0. Since 120 is positive, denominator must be positive. So, 12 -5 t >0 => t <12/5=2.4\n\nSimilarly, for r\u00b2: 240 t / (12 t -5 ) >0. Since 240 t is positive (t>0), denominator must also be positive. So, 12 t -5 >0 => t>5/12\u22480.4167\n\nTherefore, t must satisfy 5/12 < t <12/5.\n\nSo, the domain of t is (5/12, 12/5 )\n\nSo, now, we can consider BD\u00b2(t) = 960 (t +1 ) / (12 t -5 ), where t is in (5/12, 12/5).\n\nWe need to find the minimum value of BD\u00b2(t) over t in (5/12, 12/5).\n\nTo find the minimal value, let's compute the derivative of BD\u00b2 with respect to t and set it to zero.\n\nLet me denote f(t) = (t +1)/(12 t -5 )\n\nSo, BD\u00b2 = 960 f(t)\n\nCompute f'(t):\n\nf(t) = (t+1)/(12 t -5)\n\nUsing quotient rule:\n\nf'(t) = [ (1)(12 t -5) - (t+1)(12) ] / (12 t -5 )^2\n\nSimplify numerator:\n\n= [12 t -5 -12 t -12 ] / (12 t -5 )^2\n\n= [ (12 t -12 t ) + (-5 -12) ] \n\n= [ 0 t -17 ] \n\n= -17\n\nSo, f'(t) = -17 / (12 t -5 )^2\n\nWhich is always negative since denominator is positive (since t>5/12, so 12 t -5 >0, squared is positive). So, numerator is -17, so f'(t) is negative.\n\nTherefore, f(t) is a decreasing function of t. So, as t increases, f(t) decreases.\n\nTherefore, to find the minimum of BD\u00b2(t), which is proportional to f(t), we need to find the maximum t in the domain where f(t) is minimized. Since f(t) is decreasing, it attains its minimum at the maximum t.\n\nWait, let me think again. If f(t) is decreasing, then as t increases, f(t) decreases.\n\nSo, f(t) is minimized when t is as large as possible.\n\nThe maximum t is approaching 12/5=2.4 from below.\n\nSo, the minimal value of f(t) is lim t->12/5^- f(t) = lim t->12/5^- (t+1)/(12 t -5 )\n\nAt t=12/5, denominator becomes 12*(12/5) -5= (144/5)-5= (144/5 -25/5)=119/5=23.8\n\nWait, but as t approaches 12/5 from the left, denominator approaches 12*(12/5) -5 = 144/5 -25/5=119/5. Numerator approaches 12/5 +1=17/5.\n\nSo, the limit is (17/5)/(119/5) )=17/119=1/7.\n\nWait, that can't be, because 17/119 is 1/7. So, f(t) approaches 1/7 as t approaches 12/5.\n\nSimilarly, as t approaches 5/12 from above, t approaches 5/12, let's compute f(t):\n\nf(t) = (t+1)/(12 t -5 ). At t=5/12, denominator is 12*(5/12)-5=5-5=0, so f(t) approaches infinity as t approaches 5/12 from above.\n\nWait, but since t is approaching 5/12 from above, the denominator approaches zero from positive side, numerator approaches 5/12 +1=17/12, so f(t) approaches +infinity.\n\nTherefore, f(t) decreases from +infinity to 1/7 as t increases from 5/12 to 12/5.\n\nSo, BD\u00b2(t) = 960 f(t) decreases from +infinity to 960*(1/7)= 960/7 \u2248137.142857.\n\nBut wait, the problem asks for the greatest real number that is less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi. Since BD\u00b2 can approach 960/7 from above, but can't be less than that because f(t) is decreasing, approaching 1/7.\n\nWait, but wait a second. If BD\u00b2 approaches 960/7 as t approaches 12/5, then BD\u00b2 can get as close as we like to 960/7, but not less than that. So, 960/7 is the infimum, the greatest lower bound.\n\nTherefore, the greatest real number less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi is 960/7.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my steps.\n\nFirst, in expressing BD\u00b2, I think I made a mistake in the direction. Wait, when t approaches 12/5, BD\u00b2 approaches 960*(1/7)=137.142857. But is 960/7 the minimal BD\u00b2, or is there a mistake?\n\nWait, let me go back.\n\nWait, the function f(t) = (t +1)/(12 t -5 ), which is multiplied by 960 to get BD\u00b2.\n\nWe established that f(t) is decreasing in t, so it attains its minimum as t approaches 12/5 from below.\n\nSo, the minimal BD\u00b2 is 960*(1/7)=137.142857.\n\nBut wait, can BD\u00b2 be smaller? If we can make BD\u00b2 as small as possible, then 960/7 is the minimal. So, the greatest number less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi is 960/7, because BD\u00b2 is always greater than 960/7, but can approach it.\n\nWait, but the problem says \"the greatest real number that is less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi.\" So, that is the infimum of BD\u00b2. So, 960/7 is the infimum, so the answer is 960/7.\n\nBut let me confirm.\n\nWait, let me compute BD\u00b2 when t is approaching 12/5.\n\nSo, when t approaches 12/5, m\u00b2 approaches 12/5, so m approaches sqrt(12/5). Let's see what happens to points A and B.\n\nPoint A: p\u00b2=120/(12 -5 t ). When t approaches 12/5, denominator approaches 12 -5*(12/5)=12-12=0. So, p\u00b2 approaches infinity. So, point A goes to infinity.\n\nPoint B: r\u00b2=240 t/(12 t -5 ). As t approaches 12/5, denominator approaches 12*(12/5) -5=144/5 -25/5=119/5, numerator approaches 240*(12/5)= (240/5)*12=48*12=576. So, r\u00b2 approaches 576/(119/5 )=576*(5/119)=2880/119\u224824.2017.\n\nSo, point B approaches a finite point, but point A goes to infinity.\n\nWait, but if point A is going to infinity, then the rhombus becomes very large in one direction. But BD is a diagonal connecting points B and D, which are both finite as t approaches 12/5.\n\nWait, but BD is a diagonal, which depends on points B and D. Wait, D is (-r, -s), so as t approaches 12/5, r\u00b2 approaches 2880/119, so r approaches sqrt(2880/119). Let me compute sqrt(2880/119).\n\nWait, 2880 divided by 119 is approximately 24.2017, so sqrt of that is approximately 4.92.\n\nSo, BD is the distance between (r, s) and (-r, -s), which is 2*sqrt(r\u00b2 + s\u00b2 ). So, as t approaches 12/5, r approaches sqrt(2880/119), and s is (-1/m)*r, but m approaches sqrt(12/5), so s approaches (-1/sqrt(12/5)) * r.\n\nSo, s\u00b2 approaches (1/(12/5)) * r\u00b2= (5/12) r\u00b2.\n\nSo, s\u00b2 = (5/12) * r\u00b2.\n\nSo, r\u00b2 + s\u00b2 = r\u00b2 + (5/12) r\u00b2 = (17/12) r\u00b2.\n\nThus, BD\u00b2 approaches 4*(17/12) r\u00b2.\n\nWait, but I'm getting confused.\n\nWait, BD is the diagonal from B(r, s) to D(-r, -s). So, the length is sqrt( (2r)^2 + (2s)^2 )=2 sqrt(r\u00b2 + s\u00b2 ).\n\nBut since s= (-1/m) r, we have s= (-sqrt(5/(12 t )) ) r, because m\u00b2 = t=12 t -5/(240 t ), wait, no, m\u00b2 = t.\n\nWait, no, s= (-1/m ) r, so s\u00b2 = (1/m\u00b2) r\u00b2 = (1/t) r\u00b2.\n\nSo, r\u00b2 + s\u00b2= r\u00b2 + (1/t) r\u00b2 = r\u00b2 (1 +1/t )\n\nSo, BD\u00b2 =4 (r\u00b2 (1 +1/t )).\n\nBut from earlier, r\u00b2=240 t/(12 t -5 )\n\nSo, BD\u00b2=4*(240 t/(12 t -5 ))*(1 +1/t )\n\nWhich is 4*(240 t/(12 t -5 ))*( (t +1)/t )\n\nWhich is 960 (t +1 )/(12 t -5 )\n\nWhich is the same expression as before.\n\nSo, as t approaches 12/5, BD\u00b2 approaches 960*(12/5 +1)/(12*(12/5) -5 )=960*(17/5)/( (144/5 -25/5 ))=960*(17/5)/(119/5 )=960*(17/5)*(5/119 )=960*(17)/119= (960/119)*17.\n\nCompute 960 \u00f7119: 119*8=952, so 960=119*8 +8, so 960/119=8 +8/119=8.067 approx.\n\nMultiply by17: 8.067 *17 \u2248137.139, which is approximately 960/7\u2248137.142857.\n\nWait, 960 divided by 7 is 137.142857, which is the same as 960/7.\n\nSo, BD\u00b2 approaches 960/7 from above as t approaches 12/5.\n\nSo, the minimal BD\u00b2 is 960/7, which is approximately 137.142857.\n\nTherefore, the greatest real number less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi is 960/7, because BD\u00b2 can be made arbitrarily close to 960/7 but never less than that.\n\nWait, but hold on. Let me think again. Since as t approaches 12/5, BD\u00b2 approaches 960/7, which is the minimal value. So, BD\u00b2 can be as small as just above 960/7, but not smaller. So, 960/7 is the infimum. Therefore, the greatest number less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi is 960/7.\n\nWait, but wait, the problem says \"the greatest real number that is less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi.\" So, that number is 960/7, because BD\u00b2 is always greater than 960/7, but can approach it. So, 960/7 is the answer.\n\nIs 960/7 reducible? Let's see. 960 divided by 7 is 137 with remainder 1, so it is 137 and 1/7. So, 960/7 is the simplest form.\n\nSo, I think the answer is 960/7.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the derivative.\n\nEarlier, I computed f'(t)= -17/(12 t -5 )^2, which is always negative, so f(t) is decreasing. Therefore, as t increases, f(t) decreases. So, the minimal value of f(t) is at the maximum t, which is approaching 12/5.\n\nSo, yes, BD\u00b2 approaches 960/7, which is the minimal possible BD\u00b2.\n\nThus, the greatest number less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi is 960/7.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{\\dfrac{960}{7}}\n\n\nGiven the hyperbola \\(\\frac{x^2}{20} - \\frac{y^2}{24} = 1\\), we need to find the greatest real number less than \\(BD^2\\) for all rhombi \\(ABCD\\) whose diagonals intersect at the origin.\n\n1. **Hyperbola and Rhombus Properties**:\n   - The hyperbola equation is \\(\\frac{x^2}{20} - \\frac{y^2}{24} = 1\\).\n   - The diagonals of the rhombus intersect at the origin and are perpendicular.\n   - Points \\(A, B, C, D\\) lie on the hyperbola.\n\n2. **Coordinates and Lines**:\n   - Points \\(A\\) and \\(C\\) lie on the line \\(y = mx\\).\n   - Points \\(B\\) and \\(D\\) lie on the line \\(y = -\\frac{1}{m}x\\).\n\n3. **Substituting Points into Hyperbola**:\n   - For point \\(A(p, q)\\) on \\(y = mx\\), we get \\(p^2 = \\frac{120}{12 - 5m^2}\\).\n   - For point \\(B(r, s)\\) on \\(y = -\\frac{1}{m}x\\), we get \\(r^2 = \\frac{240m^2}{12m^2 - 5}\\).\n\n4. **Lengths of Diagonals**:\n   - The length of diagonal \\(BD\\) is \\(2r \\sqrt{1 + \\frac{1}{m^2}}\\).\n   - Squaring this length, we get \\(BD^2 = 4r^2 \\left(1 + \\frac{1}{m^2}\\right)\\).\n\n5. **Expressing \\(BD^2\\) in Terms of \\(t\\)**:\n   - Let \\(t = m^2\\).
