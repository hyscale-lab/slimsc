Okay, so I've got this problem here about placing chips on a 5x5 grid. Let me try to understand what it's asking.

We have 25 white chips and 25 black chips, but they're indistinct, meaning I can't tell them apart except by color. I need to place some of these chips in the 25 cells of the grid. Each cell can have at most one chip. Now, the conditions are a bit tricky.

First condition: All chips in the same row must be the same color. Similarly, all chips in the same column must be the same color. Hmm, that means if I have any chip in a row, say row 1, they all have to be white or all black. Same goes for columns.

Second condition: Any additional chip placed would violate one or more of the previous two conditions. So after placing the chips, the grid is maximal—it can't have any more chips without breaking the row or column color rules.

So, how do I approach this? Let's break it down.

Each row can be either all white, all black, or have no chips. Similarly, each column can be all white, all black, or empty. But wait, if a row is non-empty, all its chips must be same color, and same for columns.

Wait, but if a row is non-empty, then all its chips are same color, and same for columns. So, the color of a row and the color of a column must agree where they intersect.

For example, if row 1 is white, then any column that intersects row 1 must also be white if that column has a chip in row 1. Otherwise, if a column is black, it can't have any chips in row 1.

Wait, maybe not. Let me think again. The condition is that all chips in the same row are the same color, and all in the same column are the same color. So, suppose in row 1, I have some white chips. Then every chip in row 1 is white. For each column that has a chip in row 1, all other chips in that column must be white as well. Otherwise, if a column has a chip in row 1 (white) and another chip in row 2 (black), that violates the column condition because the column would have both white and black chips.

Wait, that's a crucial point. So, if any cell in a column has a white chip, all other chips in that column must also be white. Similarly for black.

Same for rows: if any cell in a row has a white chip, all other chips in that row must be white. So, the grid must be such that the rows and columns are monochromatic.

But wait, the problem allows for some cells to be empty. So, it's possible that a row has some cells occupied (all same color) and others empty. But if I have a row with some chips, all of them must be the same color, and if a column has any chip, all chips in that column must be the same color.

But this creates a sort of dependency between rows and columns. Because if row i has white chips, then any column that intersects row i must have all their chips (including the one in row i) as white. Similarly, if column j has black chips, any row that intersects column j must have all their chips as black.

This is starting to sound like a grid where the color assignments are consistent across both rows and columns. Let me consider the possibilities.

Suppose that for each row, we choose a color (white, black, or empty). Similarly, for each column, we choose a color (white, black, or empty). But these choices can't conflict: if a row is assigned white, then any column that intersects it must be assigned white as well. Or if a column is assigned black, any row that intersects it must be black.

Wait, so if row i is white, then every column that has a chip in row i must be white. So, the columns that intersect a white row must themselves be white. Similarly, if a column is black, all the rows that intersect it must be black.

This seems like a constraint where the set of white rows must correspond to the set of white columns, and the same for black.

Wait, let me try to model this.

Let R be the set of rows that have white chips. For each row in R, all the cells in that row are white. Similarly, let C be the set of columns that have white chips. For each column in C, all the cells in that column are white. The intersection of R and C is the cells that are white.

Similarly, let R' be the set of rows that have black chips, and C' be the set of columns that have black chips. The intersection of R' and C' would be the black cells.

But wait, can a cell be both white and black? No, because each cell can contain at most one chip, and chips are either white or black. So, each cell is either white, black, or empty.

But here's the thing: if a row is white and a column is black, their intersection must be empty because it can't be both white and black. Similarly, if a row is black and a column is white, their intersection must also be empty.

Therefore, the sets R and C for white must be such that R is a subset of the rows where the columns in C are white, and vice versa. Wait, maybe it's better to think in terms of matrices.

Let me think of the grid as a matrix where each cell can be W, B, or empty. But if a cell is W, then all cells in its row and column must be W or empty. Wait, no. Because if a row has W, all its non-empty cells are W, and similarly, if a column has W, all its non-empty cells are W.

Wait, but if a row has W and a column has B, their intersection can't have a chip, because that would make the cell both W and B, which is impossible.

So, perhaps the grid can be partitioned into four regions:

1. Rows in R and columns in C: cells are W.
2. Rows in R' and columns in C': cells are B.
3. Rows in R and columns not in C: cells are empty.
4. Rows not in R and columns in C: cells are empty.
5. Rows not in R and columns not in C: cells are empty.

Wait, that might be a way to model it. So, R is the set of white rows, C is the set of white columns. Then, the intersection of R and C is white cells. Similarly, R' is the set of black rows, C' is the set of black columns, and their intersection is black cells.

But wait, R and R' are disjoint because a row can't be both white and black. Similarly, C and C' are disjoint.

Moreover, if R and C are not empty, then the intersection of R and C must be all white, and the intersection of R' and C' must be all black. But also, the rows not in R can't have any white cells, so their columns can't have any white cells either.

Wait, this is getting a bit tangled. Maybe another approach: think of the grid as consisting of some white cells, some black cells, and some empty cells. The white cells form a submatrix where all rows and columns are white. Similarly, the black cells form another submatrix where all rows and columns are black.

But the white and black submatrices can't overlap, because a cell can't be both white and black. So, the grid is divided into white, black, and empty regions, with white and black regions being entirely separate.

Wait, but each cell can only be in one of these three states. So, the white region is a rectangle formed by R rows and C columns, the black region is another rectangle formed by R' rows and C' columns, and the rest are empty.

But R and R' are disjoint, C and C' are disjoint. Also, R ∪ R' is all rows, and C ∪ C' is all columns.

Wait, but the white and black regions can't overlap, so R ∩ R' is empty, and C ∩ C' is empty. Moreover, the white region is at the intersection of R and C, and black region is at the intersection of R' and C'. So, the grid is divided into four parts:

1. R × C: white cells.
2. R × C': empty cells.
3. R' × C: empty cells.
4. R' × C': black cells.

But wait, that's not quite right. Because if a row is in R (white), then all its non-empty cells must be white, so the columns in that row must be in C. Similarly, if a column is in C (white), then all its non-empty cells must be in R. So, the white region is R × C, and the black region is R' × C', but R' is the complement of R, and C' is the complement of C.

Wait, but in that case, the white and black regions are entirely separate, and the rest of the cells are empty. So, the grid consists of two rectangles: one white, one black, and the rest empty. Moreover, the white and black rectangles cannot overlap.

Wait, but the problem says that each cell can have at most one chip, so it's okay for some cells to be empty. So, the grid is divided into white, black, and empty regions, where white is a rectangle R × C, and black is a rectangle (R' × C'), where R' is the complement of R and C' is the complement of C.

But wait, the rows in R can't have any black cells because if a row is in R (white), any column intersecting it must be in C (white). Similarly, columns in C can't have any black cells.

So, the white region is a rectangle of size |R| × |C|, the black region is a rectangle of size |R'| × |C'|, and the rest are empty.

And since R and R' are complementary, |R| + |R'| = 5, and similarly |C| + |C'| =5.

Now, what's the condition for the grid to be maximal? That is, any additional chip would violate the row or column condition. So, the empty cells must not be able to accept a chip without violating the conditions.

So, for each empty cell, either its row is already filled with chips of one color, so adding a chip of another color would violate the row condition, or its column is already filled with chips of one color, so adding another color would violate the column condition. Or both.

Wait, but if a cell is empty, its row is either all white, all black, or has no chips. Similarly for the column.

If a cell is empty because its row has no chips and its column has no chips, then adding a chip there would require that all chips in that row and column would be of the same color. But since the row and column are currently empty, adding a chip of either color would be allowed, but then that would allow more chips to be added. Therefore, in order for the grid to be maximal, such cells cannot exist. Because if you could add a chip in such a cell, you could add it, and then add more chips in that row and column, violating the maximality.

So, the only empty cells must be those that are in a row that's already filled with some color, or a column that's already filled with some color. Or both.

Wait, let me think. If a row is non-empty (say, all white), then any column intersecting it must be all white or empty. But if the column is empty, can you add a chip in that cell?

If I have a row that's all white, then any column that intersects it must have all chips as white. If a column is empty, meaning it doesn't have any chips yet, then adding a white chip in that cell is allowed because it doesn't affect the row (since the row is already all white). But wait, the column would then have a white chip, so all other cells in that column must be white or empty. But the grid is supposed to be maximal, so adding that white chip would allow more chips to be added in that column, which is not allowed.

Wait, but the grid is maximal, so adding any chip would violate the conditions, meaning that for any empty cell, either its row is already filled (so can't add a chip of another color), or its column is already filled (can't add a chip of another color), or both.

Wait, but if a row is filled with white, then any empty cell in that row must have its column either filled with white or else adding a chip would require that the column becomes white, but then you could add more chips in the column, which would violate the maximality condition.

Therefore, in a maximal grid, for any empty cell, either the row is filled with some color, or the column is filled with some color, or both.

So, in other words, the empty cells are precisely those where their row is filled with some color and their column is filled with some color, but the cell itself is empty. Wait, no.

Wait, maybe the empty cells are those where either the row is filled (so can't add any more in that row) or the column is filled (can't add any more in that column). So, if a cell is empty, then either its row is filled (so can't add a chip of another color) or its column is filled (can't add a chip of another color). Otherwise, you could add a chip in that cell, and then add more in the row or column, which would violate the maximality.

So, the grid must be such that the union of filled rows and filled columns covers all empty cells. That is, every empty cell is in a filled row or a filled column.

Wait, that seems to make sense. So, the grid is divided into filled rows (all cells in these rows are filled with same color), filled columns (all cells in these columns are filled with same color), and empty cells, which are the intersection of unfilled rows and unfilled columns.

Wait, but earlier I thought of it as white and black regions, but perhaps it's better to think in terms of filled rows and filled columns, regardless of color.

But no, because rows and columns have colors, so filled rows are either all white or all black, same for columns.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused, let me try to rephrase.

Each row can be in one of three states: all white, all black, or empty.

Similarly, each column can be all white, all black, or empty.

But the grid's color assignments must be consistent. So, if a row is white, then all columns intersecting it must be white or empty. But if a column is black, all rows intersecting it must be black or empty.

Moreover, the grid must be maximal, so that no more chips can be added without violating the row or column conditions.

So, how can the grid be maximal? Suppose some rows are filled with white, some with black, and some are empty. Similarly for columns.

But the interaction between rows and columns is critical. For example, if a row is white, then all columns that intersect it must either be white or empty. If a column is black, all rows that intersect it must be black or empty.

Wait, but if a row is white and a column is black, their intersection cell can't have a chip because it would be both white and black, which is impossible. So, such a cell must be empty. But then, for the grid to be maximal, that empty cell must be in a filled row or a filled column. Because otherwise, you could add a chip there, which would cause the row to have a black chip and the column to have a white chip, which would violate the conditions.

Wait, but in this case, the cell is already in a filled row (white) and a filled column (black). So, that cell is in a filled row and a filled column, so it's empty because it can't be both white and black. So, the grid is maximal because you can't add any chip without violating the row or column conditions.

So, putting it all together, the grid can be represented as a bipartition of the rows into white, black, and empty, and similarly for columns. But the white and black regions can't overlap, so the grid is divided into four regions:

1. White rows × white columns: white chips.
2. Black rows × black columns: black chips.
3. White rows × black columns: empty.
4. Black rows × white columns: empty.
5. Empty rows × empty columns: empty.

Wait, but no. Because a row can be white, meaning all its non-empty cells are white. So, the columns in white rows must also be white if they have any chips. Similarly for black.

Alternatively, perhaps the grid is such that the set of white rows and the set of white columns form a rectangle, and the set of black rows and black columns form another rectangle, with the rest being empty.

But I'm getting stuck. Let me try a different approach.

Each row can be either white, black, or empty. Similarly, each column can be white, black, or empty. But the color assignments must be consistent.

If a row is white, then all columns that intersect it must be white or empty. If a column is black, then all rows that intersect it must be black or empty.

But since a cell can't be both white and black, the intersection of a white row and a black column must be empty.

So, for the grid to be valid, the sets of white rows and black columns must be disjoint? No, wait. The white rows can intersect with black columns, but their intersection must be empty.

So, the white region is white rows × white columns, and the black region is black rows × black columns. The rest are empty.

But then, since the grid must be maximal, every empty cell must be in a white row or a white column, or a black row or a black column. Wait, no, because if a cell is empty, it's in a row that's not white and not black (so empty), or a column that's not white and not black (so empty). But since the grid is maximal, such cells can't exist because you could add a chip there.

Wait, no. Because if a row is empty, you can add a chip in that row, but the column must then be set to that color, which might interfere with other rows or columns.

This is getting a bit too abstract. Let me try to think in terms of possible configurations.

Suppose all rows are white. Then all columns must be white, because if a column had a chip in a white row, it must be white. So, the entire grid is white. Similarly, if all columns are black, the entire grid is black.

But in that case, to be maximal, you can't add any more chips because all cells are filled. But the problem says that each cell can have at most one chip, so in that case, we've used 25 chips of one color, but since we have 25 of each, that's a possible configuration.

But wait, the problem says "some of these chips" are placed, so using all 25 of one color is allowed.

But wait, the problem states that we have 25 white and 25 black chips, but in this case, we've used 25 white chips and zero black chips, which is allowed because we're placing some of them.

But how does that fit into the maximality condition? If the entire grid is white, adding any black chip would violate the row or column condition because each row and column must be uniform. So yes, it's maximal.

Similarly, the entire grid being black is another maximal configuration.

Now, what about other configurations? Let's suppose that some rows are white, some are black, and some are empty. Similarly for columns.

But remember, if a row is white, all columns intersecting it must be white or empty. But if a column is black, all rows intersecting it must be black or empty. So, the white and black regions can't overlap.

Wait, so the grid is divided into four quadrants:

- White rows and white columns: white chips.
- White rows and black columns: empty.
- Black rows and white columns: empty.
- Black rows and black columns: black chips.

And the rest of the cells (if any rows or columns are empty) would be empty.

But to have the grid maximal, all empty cells must be in rows that are either white or black, or columns that are white or black.

Wait, but if a row is empty, then all its cells are empty. Similarly for a column. So, if a row is empty, you can't add any chips in that row because it's already considered empty, but that would conflict with the maximality condition, because you could add a chip in that row, which would require that the column be set to that color, potentially allowing more chips. Hmm, maybe not.

Wait, the maximality condition says that any additional chip would violate the conditions. So, if a row is empty, can I add a chip there? If I add a white chip in an empty row, then the entire row must become white, which would require all columns intersecting that row to be white. But if some of those columns are already black, that's impossible. So, perhaps adding a chip in an empty row would violate the column condition if the column is already set to black.

Wait, but if a row is empty, and a column is empty, their intersection is empty. So, could I add a chip there? If I do, that would require that the entire row becomes that color and the entire column becomes that color. But if the row and column were previously empty, that's allowed. But then, adding that one chip would allow me to add more chips in that row and column, which would violate the maximality.

Therefore, in a maximal grid, there can't be any cells that are in empty rows and empty columns. So, every empty cell must be in a filled row or a filled column.

Therefore, the grid must be such that the union of filled rows and filled columns covers all cells. Wait, that is, every cell is in a filled row or a filled column.

Because if a cell is in an empty row and an empty column, then you could add a chip there, which would allow more chips in that row and column, violating the maximality.

Thus, for the grid to be maximal, every empty cell must be in a filled row or a filled column.

So, the grid is divided into:

- Filled rows (all white or black)
- Filled columns (all white or black)
- Empty cells, which are in filled rows or filled columns.

Wait, but how does that interact with the colors?

Suppose I have a filled row that's white. Then, any column intersecting it must be white or empty. But if a column is filled and black, then any row intersecting it must be black or empty.

So, the white filled rows can only intersect with white or empty columns, and black filled columns can only intersect with black or empty rows.

Wait, but this is getting too tangled. Maybe it's better to think in terms of the grid being covered by filled rows and filled columns.

Each filled row is entirely white or entirely black.

Each filled column is entirely white or entirely black.

Moreover, a filled row and filled column can only intersect if they are the same color.

If a filled row is white, then the columns it intersects must be white or empty. If a filled column is black, the rows it intersects must be black or empty.

So, the white filled rows can only intersect with white filled columns, and black filled rows can only intersect with black filled columns.

Therefore, the grid is partitioned into four regions:

1. White filled rows × white filled columns: white chips.
2. Black filled rows × black filled columns: black chips.
3. White filled rows × black filled columns: empty (since white and black can't coexist).
4. Black filled rows × white filled columns: empty.

Additionally, any rows not in white or black filled rows are empty rows.

Similarly, any columns not in white or black filled columns are empty columns.

But for the grid to be maximal, every empty cell must be in a filled row or filled column. So, that means that the union of filled rows and filled columns must cover all cells.

Wait, but that's not possible because filled rows and filled columns can leave some cells empty if they are in unfilled rows and unfilled columns.

Wait, but earlier we concluded that to be maximal, every empty cell must be in a filled row or a filled column. Therefore, the set of filled rows and filled columns must cover all cells. So, the union of filled rows and filled columns must be the entire grid. Which would mean that every cell is in a filled row or a filled column.

But that can't be, because filled rows and filled columns are either white or black. So, perhaps the grid is such that every row is filled (either white or black) and every column is filled (either white or black). But that would mean the entire grid is filled, which is one case.

But wait, another possibility is that all rows and all columns are filled, but in such a way that the white and black regions don't overlap. For example, some rows are white, some are black, and same for columns, but their intersections are either white or black, but not both.

But in that case, the grid would have white and black regions, but the rows and columns are all filled. So, the grid is entirely filled, but with some cells white and some black, arranged in rectangles.

Wait, but if all rows and columns are filled, then each row is entirely white or black, and each column is entirely white or black. The only way this can happen without conflict is if the grid is monochromatic. Because suppose you have a white row and a black column; their intersection would have to be both white and black, which is impossible. So, the only way for all rows and columns to be filled is if all rows are the same color and all columns are the same color, which implies the entire grid is that color.

But that can't be the case because we can have the entire grid white or black, but the problem allows for some empty cells as well.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me try to think differently.

Suppose we model this problem as a bipartite graph between rows and columns, where each edge represents a cell. Now, each edge can be colored white, black, or not present (empty). The constraints are that all edges incident to a row must be the same color or not present, and similarly for columns.

Moreover, the grid must be maximal, meaning that no additional edge can be added without violating the color constraints.

So, in graph terms, the graph is such that every node (row or column) has all its edges of the same color or none. And the graph is maximal, meaning that you can't add any edge without causing a conflict.

This seems similar to a graph where the edges are colored with two colors, W and B, and the coloring is such that the neighborhood of each node is monochromatic.

But perhaps this is overcomplicating.

Another approach: since each row and column must be monochromatic or empty, the grid can be represented by selecting a subset of rows and columns to be white, another subset to be black, such that the white and black subsets are non-overlapping.

Wait, but how exactly?

Let me denote:

- Let R_w be the set of white rows.

- Let R_b be the set of black rows.

- Let C_w be the set of white columns.

- Let C_b be the set of black columns.

Since a row can't be both white and black, R_w and R_b are disjoint, and R_w ∪ R_b = all rows.

Similarly, C_w and C_b are disjoint, and C_w ∪ C_b = all columns.

Now, the white region is R_w × C_w, the black region is R_b × C_b.

The other regions (R_w × C_b, R_b × C_w) are empty.

Additionally, the cells not in R_w ∪ R_b or C_w ∪ C_b are empty, but since R_w ∪ R_b is all rows and C_w ∪ C_b is all columns, there are no such cells.

Wait, but then the grid is entirely covered by white and black regions, meaning the entire grid is filled, which only allows two possibilities: all white or all black. But that can't be because the problem allows for some empty cells.

Wait, perhaps my initial assumption is wrong. Maybe R_w and R_b are not necessarily covering all rows. Similarly for columns.

Wait, but if a row is not in R_w or R_b, then it's empty. Similarly for columns.

But then, the intersection of an empty row and an empty column is empty, but that would allow adding a chip there, violating the maximality.

Therefore, for the grid to be maximal, there can be no empty cells that are in empty rows and empty columns. So, the empty rows and empty columns must be such that their intersection is empty.

But how? Because if there's an empty row and an empty column, their intersection would be an empty cell, which is not allowed in a maximal grid.

Therefore, the grid cannot have both empty rows and empty columns. So, either all rows are filled (either white or black), or all columns are filled, but not both.

Wait, that might make sense.

So, the grid is either:

1. All rows are filled (each row is either white or black), and there are no empty columns. Or,

2. All columns are filled (each column is either white or black), and there are no empty rows.

But not both. Because if both exist, you could have an empty row and an empty column, whose intersection is an empty cell, which would allow adding a chip, violating maximality.

Wait, but the problem allows for some empty cells, but not such that you can add a chip without violating the conditions.

So, perhaps the grid is such that either all rows are filled (each row is white or black), and the columns are either all white, all black, or some combination. But the columns can't have empty cells because that would allow adding a chip in an empty column, which is in a filled row.

Wait, no, because if a column is empty, and a row is filled, their intersection is empty. But since the row is filled, adding a chip in that cell would require the column to be set to that color, which would conflict with any other rows in that column.

This is getting too convoluted. Let me try to think of the grid in terms of possible configurations.

Case 1: All rows are filled.

Each row is either white or black. Then, for each column, since all its cells are in filled rows, the column must be entirely white or entirely black.

But since each row is filled, the column can't be a mix of white and black. So, each column must be all white or all black.

But since each row is filled, the color of the column is determined by the color of the rows it intersects. Wait, but if a column has both white and black rows, that's impossible because the column must be uniform.

Therefore, in this case, all rows must be the same color, or the columns must be the same color.

Wait, that suggests that if all rows are filled, then all columns must be either all white or all black. So, the grid is entirely white or entirely black.

Similarly, if all columns are filled, then all rows must be entirely white or entirely black.

But then, the only maximal grids are the entirely white or entirely black grids.

But that can't be right because the problem allows for some configurations where some chips are placed, not necessarily all.

Wait, perhaps I made a wrong assumption earlier. Let's re-examine the maximality condition.

The grid is maximal if any additional chip would violate the conditions. So, in a grid where some rows and columns are filled, but not all, the empty cells must be such that adding a chip anywhere would require changing the color of a row or column, which isn't allowed.

Wait, for example, suppose I have a grid where some rows are white and some are black, and similarly for columns. Then, the empty cells are where white rows and black columns intersect, which are empty. But in such a case, could I add a chip in an empty cell? Let's say I add a white chip in a white row and a black column. But that column is currently black, so adding a white chip would conflict with the column's color.

Alternatively, if I add a black chip, the row is white, so that's a conflict.

Therefore, in this case, the empty cells cannot have any chips added without violating the row or column condition, so the grid is maximal.

Wait, but in this case, the grid isn't entirely filled, but it's maximal because you can't add any more chips. So, such grids are possible.

Therefore, the grid can be such that:

- Some rows are white (filled with white chips).

- Some rows are black (filled with black chips).

- Some columns are white (filled with white chips).

- Some columns are black (filled with black chips).

- The intersection of white rows and white columns is white.

- The intersection of black rows and black columns is black.

- The intersections of white rows and black columns, and black rows and white columns, are empty.

But in this case, the grid is maximal because any empty cell is in either a white row and black column or a black row and white column. Adding a chip there would require changing the color of the row or column, which is not allowed.

Therefore, such grids are indeed maximal.

So, the problem reduces to counting the number of such configurations where:

- Some subset of rows are white (R_w).

- Some subset of columns are white (C_w).

- The intersection R_w × C_w is all white.

- Some subset of rows are black (R_b), where R_b is disjoint from R_w.

- Some subset of columns are black (C_b), where C_b is disjoint from C_w.

- The intersection R_b × C_b is all black.

- The remaining cells (R_w × C_b and R_b × C_w) are empty.

And the grid must be such that adding any chip to an empty cell would violate the row or column condition.

Moreover, in this case, the grid is maximal because each empty cell is in a filled row or a filled column.

Wait, but in this case, the empty cells are in filled rows or filled columns. So, adding a chip to an empty cell would require that the row or column be set to that color, but since the row or column is already filled with another color, that's impossible.

Therefore, such grids are maximal.

So, the number of such grids corresponds to the number of ways to choose R_w, R_b, C_w, C_b such that:

- R_w and R_b are disjoint, and their union is all rows.

- C_w and C_b are disjoint, and their union is all columns.

- R_w × C_w is white.

- R_b × C_b is black.

But wait, no, because R_b is the set of black rows, and C_b is the set of black columns.

Wait, no. If R_w is the set of white rows, R_b is the set of black rows, which are the complement of R_w.

Similarly, C_w is the set of white columns, C_b is the complement of C_w.

Therefore, the white region is R_w × C_w, the black region is R_b × C_b.

But in this case, the grid is divided into four regions:

1. White: R_w × C_w.

2. Black: R_b × C_b.

3. Empty: R_w × C_b and R_b × C_w.

But since R_w and R_b are complementary, and C_w and C_b are complementary, their intersections define the empty regions.

So, the problem reduces to choosing subsets R_w and C_w of the rows and columns, respectively, such that R_w and C_w can be any subsets, but with the constraint that the white and black regions do not interfere.

Wait, but how does this affect the count?

Each such configuration is determined by choosing R_w (a subset of the 5 rows) and C_w (a subset of the 5 columns). Once R_w and C_w are chosen, R_b is the complement of R_w, and C_b is the complement of C_w.

Then, the white region is R_w × C_w, and the black region is R_b × C_b.

But we have to ensure that the white and black regions do not overlap, which they don't because R_b is the complement of R_w, and C_b is the complement of C_w.

But wait, the white and black regions could potentially overlap if R_w and R_b are overlapping, but since R_w and R_b are complements, they are disjoint.

So, each configuration is uniquely determined by choosing R_w and C_w.

But now, we have to ensure that the number of white chips and black chips used does not exceed 25 each.

Wait, the problem allows for using some of the 25 white and 25 black chips. So, the number of white chips used is |R_w| × |C_w|, and the number of black chips used is |R_b| × |C_b|.

But since |R_w| + |R_b| =5 and |C_w| + |C_b|=5, the total chips used are |R_w||C_w| + |R_b||C_b|.

But the problem states that we have 25 white and 25 black chips, but we don't necessarily have to use all of them. Wait, the problem says "some of these chips". So, the number of white and black chips used can be any number up to 25 each.

But wait, the problem says "some of these chips", so we can use any number from 0 to 25 for white and same for black, as long as the total number of chips is |R_w||C_w| + |R_b||C_b|.

But wait, no, because the white and black counts are fixed. We have 25 white and 25 black chips. But the problem doesn't specify how many we have to use, just that we have that many available. So, the number of white and black chips placed can be any number up to 25 each.

But in our configuration, the number of white chips is |R_w| × |C_w|, and the number of black chips is |R_b| × |C_b|.

But since |R_w| + |R_b| =5 and |C_w| + |C_b|=5, the number of white and black chips can vary.

But the problem allows for any number of chips, as long as they don't exceed 25 each.

Wait, but in our case, the maximum number of white chips is 5×5=25, same for black. So, any number of white and black chips up to 25 each is acceptable.

Therefore, for each possible R_w and C_w, as long as |R_w||C_w| ≤25 and |R_b||C_b| ≤25.

But since R_w and C_w can be any subsets, their sizes can range from 0 to 5.

Wait, but in reality, |R_w| can be from 0 to5, and same for |C_w|.

So, for each possible pair (k, l) where k is the number of white rows and l is the number of white columns, the number of white chips is k*l, and the number of black chips is (5 -k)*(5 - l).

But we have to make sure that k*l ≤25 and (5 -k)*(5 - l) ≤25. But since k and l are at most 5, the products are at most 25, so these conditions are automatically satisfied.

Therefore, the number of configurations is the number of possible R_w and C_w, which is 2^5 * 2^5 = 1024. But wait, no, because R_w and C_w can be any subsets, but we have to consider that R_b and C_b are uniquely determined as their complements.

But wait, no, because for each R_w and C_w, the black region is determined as R_b × C_b. So, each choice of R_w and C_w corresponds to exactly one configuration.

But wait, but the problem is that the white and black regions must not overlap, which they don't.

But now, the issue is that some configurations might have overlapping white and black regions. But no, because R_w and R_b are disjoint, as are C_w and C_b.

Wait, but no, R_w is a subset of rows, R_b is its complement. Similarly for columns. So, the white and black regions are in different rows and columns, so they don't overlap.

So, each configuration is uniquely determined by choosing R_w and C_w.

But now, we have to count how many such configurations there are, considering that |R_w| can be 0 to5 and |C_w| can be 0 to5.

But wait, the problem is that some configurations might result in the same grid. For example, choosing R_w = all rows and C_w = all columns is the same as choosing R_w = all rows and C_w = all columns, which results in a grid with all white chips.

Similarly, choosing R_w = empty set and C_w = empty set would result in all black chips.

Wait, no. If R_w is empty, then all rows are black. If C_w is empty, then all columns are black. So, the intersection is all black chips.

Wait, but in this case, the grid is all black. Similarly, if R_w is all rows and C_w is all columns, the grid is all white.

So, each configuration is determined by R_w and C_w, and each such pair is unique.

But the problem is that the number of possible R_w and C_w is 2^5 * 2^5 = 1024, but many of these configurations would result in the same grid. For example, choosing R_w as {1} and C_w as {1} is different from R_w as {2} and C_w as {2}, but they both result in a single white chip in the grid.

Wait, no. Because in the first case, R_w is {1}, C_w is {1}, so the white region is cell (1,1). The black region is R_b × C_b = {2,3,4,5} × {2,3,4,5}, so the black chips are in the lower right 4x4 grid. So, the configuration is unique.

Similarly, R_w as {2} and C_w as {2} would result in white chip at (2,2) and black chips at R_b × C_b. So, each configuration is unique.

Therefore, the total number of such grids is indeed 2^5 * 2^5 = 1024.

But wait, the problem says "some of these chips" are placed. So, configurations where no chips are placed are allowed? Because R_w and C_w could both be empty, leading to all black chips, but that's the same as R_w empty and C_w empty.

Wait, but in that case, R_w is empty, so all rows are black, and C_w is empty, so all columns are black. So, the grid is all black, which is one configuration.

Similarly, R_w is all rows, C_w is all columns: grid is all white.

So, each configuration is determined by R_w and C_w, and they are 2^5 * 2^5 = 1024.

But wait, the problem says "some of these chips", which would exclude the case where no chips are placed. Because "some" implies at least one chip. But the problem doesn't specify that; it says "some of these chips", which can include zero.

But the problem says, "any additional chip placed on the grid would violate one or more of the previous two conditions." So, if the grid is empty, can we add a chip? Yes, we can add a chip anywhere, which wouldn't violate any conditions because the row and column are empty. Therefore, the empty grid is not maximal because you can add a chip without violating anything.

Therefore, the empty grid is not counted. So, we have to subtract that case.

But in our count of 1024, how many configurations correspond to the empty grid?

Only one: R_w is empty and C_w is empty. Because then, all rows are black, all columns are black, but the grid is empty. Wait, no. If R_w and C_w are both empty, then R_b is all rows, C_b is all columns, so the grid is all black. So, the grid is filled with black chips.

Wait, that's not correct. If R_w is empty, then all rows are black. If C_w is empty, all columns are black. So, the intersection is all cells are black. So, the grid is entirely filled with black chips. Therefore, the only configuration that results in an empty grid is when both R_w and C_w are empty, but that leads to all black cells, not empty.

Wait, no. If R_w is empty, then all rows are black. If C_w is empty, all columns are black. So, the intersection is all cells are black. Therefore, the only way to have an empty grid is if both R_w and C_w are empty, but that leads to all cells being black. So, the empty grid is not possible under this model.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake earlier. Let me think again.

If R_w is empty, then all rows are black. If C_w is empty, all columns are black. So, the grid is entirely black. So, the only way to have an empty grid is if R_w and C_w are such that their intersections are empty, but that's not possible because if R_w is empty, then all rows are black, so the grid is entirely black.

Wait, maybe the empty grid is not possible under this model, because if you have no white rows and no white columns, the grid is entirely black. So, the only way to have an empty grid is if all rows and columns are empty, which is not possible because each row and column must be filled as white or black.

Wait, but the problem says that each cell can have at most one chip, but doesn't require that any cell must be filled. So, is the empty grid allowed? Because the problem says "some of these chips", which could mean zero or more.

But in our earlier analysis, the empty grid is not possible because the grid would have to be entirely filled as black or white if all rows and columns are filled. So, perhaps the empty grid is not part of our configurations.

Wait, but if R_w is empty and C_w is empty, then R_b is all rows and C_b is all columns, so the grid is entirely black. So, the grid is filled with 25 black chips.

Similarly, if R_w is all rows and C_w is all columns, the grid is entirely white.

So, the only way to have an empty grid is if there are no filled rows or columns. But that's impossible because if all rows are empty, then all columns must be empty as well, but then you could add a chip anywhere, which would violate the maximality.

Therefore, the empty grid is not a valid configuration because it's not maximal.

So, the total number of configurations is 2^5 * 2^5 = 1024, but minus 1 for the empty grid? But wait, in our model, the empty grid isn't possible because it would require all rows and columns to be empty, which isn't allowed as per the earlier analysis.

Wait, no. In our model, every grid is either all white, all black, or a combination where white and black regions don't overlap. So, the empty grid isn't a possible configuration because you can't have all rows and columns empty.

Therefore, the total number of configurations is 1024, but we need to subtract the two monochromatic grids because they use all 25 chips of one color, but the problem allows for using some chips, not necessarily all.

Wait, no. The problem allows for using some chips, which can be any number from zero to 25 for each color, but as long as you don't exceed 25 each.

But in our model, the number of white chips is |R_w| × |C_w|, and black chips is |R_b| × |C_b|, which can vary.

But the problem is that when |R_w|=5 and |C_w|=5, the number of white chips is 25, which is allowed. Similarly, when |R_w|=0 and |C_w|=0, the number of black chips is 25, which is allowed.

But the question is whether these are included in the count.

Wait, the problem says "some of these chips", which can include all 25 of one color and zero of the other. So, the two monochromatic grids (all white and all black) are included.

Therefore, the total number of configurations is 1024.

But wait, that can't be right because when |R_w|=k and |C_w|=l, the number of white chips is k*l, and black chips is (5 -k)*(5 - l). So, each configuration is determined by R_w and C_w, but each R_w and C_w can be any subset, leading to 32 *32 =1024 possibilities.

But the problem is that some of these configurations may not satisfy the maximality condition.

Wait, no, because earlier we concluded that each configuration where R_w and C_w are subsets, and R_b and C_b are their complements, is maximal because any empty cell is in a filled row or filled column, so adding a chip would violate the row or column condition.

Wait, but earlier I thought that the empty grid isn't possible because it would require all rows and columns to be empty, which isn't allowed. So, the empty grid isn't part of the 1024 configurations.

Wait, no, because in our model, R_w and C_w can be any subsets, including the empty set. But when R_w is empty, all rows are black, and when C_w is empty, all columns are black. So, the grid is entirely black. Similarly, when R_w is all rows and C_w is all columns, the grid is entirely white.

So, the 1024 configurations include all possible ways of choosing R_w and C_w, leading to grids that are maximal.

Therefore, the answer should be 1024.

But wait, let me think again. The problem says "some of these chips", which implies that at least one chip is placed. Because "some" usually means at least one. So, the all-black and all-white grids are included (they use all 25 chips of one color), but the empty grid is not, because it uses zero chips.

But in our model, the empty grid isn't possible because the only way to have all cells empty is if R_w and C_w are both empty, which leads to all cells being black. So, the empty grid isn't a possible configuration.

Therefore, the total number of configurations is 1024, and all of them are valid because they are maximal.

But wait, another thought: are some configurations equivalent under row and column permutations? For example, choosing R_w as the first row and C_w as the first column is equivalent to choosing R_w as the second row and C_w as the second column in terms of the structure of the grid.

But the problem says the chips are indistinct except for color, and the grid is a 5x5 grid. So, the configurations are considered different if the positions of the white and black regions are different.

For example, having a single white cell at (1,1) is different from having it at (2,2). So, the count is indeed 1024.

But wait, the problem says "the number of ways to place some of these chips". So, each configuration is a distinct placement, considering the positions on the grid.

Therefore, the answer is 1024.

But wait, 2^5 * 2^5 is 1024, which seems high. Let me check for a smaller grid.

Suppose the grid is 1x1. Then, the number of configurations would be 2^1 * 2^1 =4.

But in a 1x1 grid, the possible configurations are:

- Place a white chip.

- Place a black chip.

- Place nothing (but this isn't maximal because you can add a chip).

Wait, but in a 1x1 grid, the maximal configurations are placing a white or a black chip. Because placing nothing isn't maximal—you can place a chip.

So, the number of configurations is 2.

But according to 2^1 * 2^1 =4, which would include:

- R_w empty, C_w empty: place a black chip.

- R_w non-empty, C_w empty: same as above.

Wait, no, in 1x1, R_w can be empty or {1}, and C_w can be empty or {1}.

If R_w is {1}, C_w is {1}: white chip.

If R_w is {1}, C_w is empty: but then R_b is empty, which can't be because R_b is the complement of R_w. Wait, in 1x1, R_w is either empty or {1}. Similarly for C_w.

If R_w is {1}, C_w is {1}: white chip.

If R_w is {1}, C_w is empty: black chip, because R_b is empty (since R_w is all rows), but C_b is all columns (since C_w is empty). So, R_b × C_b is empty × all columns, which is nothing. So, the grid is empty? No, because R_w is {1}, C_w is empty, so the white region is empty. The black region is R_b × C_b = empty × all columns, which is empty. So, the grid is empty, which isn't maximal.

Wait, this suggests that our model isn't capturing the 1x1 case correctly.

In the 1x1 grid, the configurations are:

1. White chip: R_w = {1}, C_w = {1}.

2. Black chip: R_w = empty, C_w = empty.

3. Empty grid: Not maximal.

But according to our earlier model, the number of configurations is 2^1 *2^1=4, but only two of them are maximal.

So, our model overcounts in the 1x1 case.

Therefore, our approach is flawed.

Hmm, this suggests that the initial approach is incorrect.

Alternative approach: Let's model the grid as a matrix where each cell is either white, black, or empty. The constraints are:

- All cells in a row are the same color or empty.

- All cells in a column are the same color or empty.

- The grid is maximal; no additional chip can be placed without violating the above.

So, the grid must be such that:

1. Each non-empty row is monochromatic.

2. Each non-empty column is monochromatic.

3. The grid is maximal.

In the 1x1 case, the maximal configurations are placing a white or black chip, which are two possibilities.

But according to our initial model, we get four configurations, but two of them are non-maximal (empty grid). So, the initial model is wrong.

Therefore, we need a different approach.

Let me think differently. For each row, it can be in one of three states: white, black, or empty. Similarly, for each column.

But the states are not independent because the color of a row affects the possible colors of columns and vice versa.

In order to satisfy the conditions, the grid must be such that the color assignments are consistent across rows and columns.

This seems similar to a bipartite graph where rows and columns are nodes, and the edges represent the color assignments.

Wait, perhaps another way: the grid can be divided into four regions:

- White region: A rectangle of white cells.

- Black region: A rectangle of black cells.

- Empty regions elsewhere.

But the white and black regions cannot overlap.

So, the grid is divided into two rectangles: one white and one black, and the rest empty.

Moreover, the grid is maximal, so any additional chip would require adding to a row or column that's already filled, which is impossible.

So, the white region is a rectangle formed by some rows and some columns, and the black region is a rectangle formed by the remaining rows and columns.

So, in this model, the grid is determined by choosing a set of rows R and a set of columns C to be white. Then, the white region is R × C, and the black region is (R' × C'), where R' and C' are the complements of R and C.

But wait, in this case, the black region is R' × C', which may overlap with the white region if R and C are not properly chosen.

Wait, no, because R and R' are disjoint, and C and C' are disjoint. So, R × C and R' × C' are disjoint.

But in this model, the white and black regions are entirely separate.

But in this case, the empty regions would be R × C' and R' × C.

But for the grid to be maximal, every empty cell must be in a filled row or a filled column.

In other words, every empty cell is either in R (so row is filled) or in C (so column is filled).

Wait, but in this model, the empty cells are in R × C' and R' × C.

So, cells in R × C' are in a filled row (R) but empty column (C'). Similarly, cells in R' × C are in empty row (R') but filled column (C).

Therefore, every empty cell is in a filled row or a filled column, making the grid maximal.

Therefore, the grid is determined by choosing R (white rows) and C (white columns), which define the white region R × C and the black region R' × C'.

But wait, the black region is R' × C', which may not necessarily be filled with black chips. Because if R' is non-empty and C' is non-empty, then R' × C' is filled with black chips.

But if R' is empty, then there are no black chips. Similarly, if C' is empty, no black chips.

But in this model, the black region is R' × C', which may be non-empty or empty.

But in the problem statement, we have 25 white and 25 black chips. So, the number of white chips is |R| × |C|, and the number of black chips is |R'| × |C'|.

But since we have 25 of each, we have:

|R| × |C| ≤25,

|R'| × |C'| ≤25.

But |R| + |R'| =5,

|C| + |C'| =5.

So, for each possible R and C, |R| and |C| can range from 0 to5, but with the constraints that |R| × |C| ≤25 and |R'| × |C'| ≤25.

But since |R| and |C| are at most5, |R| × |C| is at most25, same for |R'| × |C'|.

Therefore, all possible R and C are allowed.

Therefore, the number of configurations is the number of ways to choose R and C, which is (number of subsets of rows) × (number of subsets of columns) =2^5 ×2^5=1024.

But wait, in the 1x1 case, this model gives 4 configurations, but only two are maximal. So, perhaps this model overcounts.

Wait, in the 1x1 case, R can be empty or {1}, same for C.

If R is {1}, C is {1}: white chip.

If R is {1}, C is empty: white region is {1} × empty = empty, black region is empty × {1} = empty. So, the grid is empty, which isn't maximal.

If R is empty, C is {1}: same as above, grid is empty.

If R is empty, C is empty: black chip.

So, only two configurations are maximal: white chip and black chip.

So, our model counts four configurations, but two are non-maximal.

Therefore, the initial approach is overcounting.

So, what's the correct way to count?

We need to count the number of pairs (R, C) where R is a subset of rows, C is a subset of columns, such that either R × C is non-empty or R' × C' is non-empty (i.e., the grid isn't empty), and the grid is maximal.

Wait, but in the 1x1 case, the configurations where R × C is empty and R' × C' is empty (i.e., the grid is empty) are not maximal, so they should be excluded.

So, in general, for a 5x5 grid, the number of maximal configurations is the number of pairs (R, C) where R is a subset of rows, C is a subset of columns, and at least one of R × C or R' × C' is non-empty.

But wait, in the 1x1 case, that would be 2^1 ×2^1 =4 total, minus 1 for the empty grid, giving 3. But in reality, only two are maximal.

Hmm, perhaps another approach is needed.

Let me think in terms of the possible colorings:

Each row can be white, black, or empty.

Each column can be white, black, or empty.

But the color assignments must be consistent.

Moreover, the grid must be maximal.

So, for each row, it can be white, black, or empty. Similarly for columns.

But the color assignments must satisfy that if a row is white, all columns intersecting it must be white or empty. If a column is black, all rows intersecting it must be black or empty.

Additionally, the grid is maximal, so no empty cell can be added without violating the row or column condition.

Therefore, the grid must be such that:

- For every empty cell (i,j), either row i is white or black (so can't add a chip of different color), or column j is white or black (so can't add a chip of different color).

Which means that every empty cell is in a non-empty row or a non-empty column.

Therefore, the set of empty cells is the complement of the union of non-empty rows and non-empty columns.

So, the grid is determined by the sets of non-empty rows and non-empty columns.

Each non-empty row is assigned a color (white or black), and each non-empty column is assigned a color (white or black).

But the color assignments must be consistent: if a row is white, all columns intersecting it must be white; if a column is black, all rows intersecting it must be black.

Therefore, the non-empty rows and non-empty columns must form a rectangle where the intersection is the same color.

Wait, this is getting complicated, but perhaps the correct way to model it is that the grid is determined by choosing a set of rows and a set of columns, and assigning them a color (white or black), such that the intersection is that color.

Moreover, the rest of the cells are empty.

But in this case, the grid is maximal because any empty cell is in a non-empty row or non-empty column.

Therefore, the number of such grids is equal to the number of ways to choose a subset of rows, a subset of columns, and assign a color (white or black) to them, ensuring that if a row is assigned a color, all columns intersecting it must be assigned that color, and vice versa.

But this seems like we're back to the initial problem.

Alternatively, perhaps the grid can be represented as selecting a rectangle (possibly empty) of white cells, and another rectangle (possibly empty) of black cells, such that they don't overlap, and the rest are empty.

But in that case, the number of such grids would be the number of ways to choose a white rectangle and a black rectangle that don't overlap.

But the white rectangle is determined by choosing some rows and some columns, and similarly for black.

But how does this relate to the count?

Each white rectangle is determined by choosing a subset of rows R_w and a subset of columns C_w.

Similarly, each black rectangle is determined by R_b and C_b.

But R_w and R_b must be disjoint, and C_w and C_b must be disjoint.

Therefore, the total number of such grids is the sum over all possible R_w, C_w, R_b, C_b where R_w ∩ R_b = empty, and C_w ∩ C_b = empty.

But R_b is the complement of R_w, and C_b is the complement of C_w.

Therefore, the number of grids is equal to the number of ways to choose R_w and C_w, which is 2^5 ×2^5=1024.

But in the 1x1 case, this leads to four configurations, but only two are maximal.

So, the discrepancy arises because in the 1x1 case, some configurations are not maximal.

Therefore, the correct count must exclude configurations where the grid isn't maximal.

So, how do we ensure that the grid is maximal?

A grid is maximal if:

- Every empty cell is in a filled row or filled column.

Which means that the union of filled rows and filled columns covers all cells.

Therefore, in terms of R and C:

The union of R (filled rows) and the columns filled with white or black must cover all cells.

Wait, but filled rows can be white or black, and filled columns can be white or black.

This is getting too tangled.

Alternative approach: Let's model this as a bipartite graph where one partition is the set of rows and the other is the set of columns.

Each edge can be colored white, black, or not present (empty).

Constraints:

- All edges from a row must be the same color or absent.

- All edges to a column must be the same color or absent.

- The graph is maximal, meaning no additional edge can be added without violating the constraints.

In graph theory terms, this is a graph where each node has edges of a single color or none, and the graph is such that adding any edge would create a conflict.

So, such graphs are called "conflict-free" or something similar.

But I'm not sure about the exact terminology.

But regardless, the number of such graphs can be determined.

Each such graph is determined by choosing a subset of rows and columns and assigning them a color, such that the intersection is that color.

Moreover, the graph must be maximal, meaning that every empty cell is in a filled row or filled column.

Therefore, the number of such graphs is equal to the number of ways to choose R_w, C_w, R_b, C_b such that:

- R_w ∩ R_b = empty,

- C_w ∩ C_b = empty,

- R_w ∪ R_b = all rows,

- C_w ∪ C_b = all columns,

- The white region is R_w × C_w,

- The black region is R_b × C_b.

But in this case, the grid is maximal because every empty cell is in R_w or R_b (filled rows) or C_w or C_b (filled columns).

Therefore, the number of such grids is (number of ways to choose R_w) × (number of ways to choose C_w).

But for each R_w, C_w can be any subset of columns, leading to 32 ×32=1024 possibilities.

But in the 1x1 case, this gives four possibilities, but only two are maximal. So, the model is overcounting.

Wait, perhaps the issue is that some configurations are equivalent when R_w and C_w are swapped or something.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct count is 3^5 +3^5 -1, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another way: For each row, it can be white, black, or empty. Similarly for each column.

But the colors must be consistent.

So, the number of colorings is equal to the number of ways to assign to each row a color (W, B, E) and to each column a color (W, B, E), such that if a row is W, all columns intersecting it must be W or E, and if a column is B, all rows intersecting it must be B or E.

But this seems complex.

Alternatively, think of the grid as a bipartition where each row is labeled with a color (W, B, E), and each column is labeled with a color (W, B, E), with the constraint that if a row is W, all its columns must be W or E, and if a column is B, all its rows must be B or E.

But this is similar to a constraint satisfaction problem.

But how does this help in counting?

Perhaps instead, the grid must be such that the set of white rows and white columns form a rectangle, and the set of black rows and black columns form another rectangle, which don't overlap.

But in this case, the number of such configurations is the number of ways to choose white rows and white columns, which is 2^5 ×2^5=1024.

But as in the 1x1 case, this counts configurations that aren't maximal.

Therefore, perhaps the correct count is the number of such configurations minus the non-maximal ones.

But I don't see an easy way to compute that.

Alternatively, perhaps the number of maximal grids is equal to the number of ways to choose a subset of rows and a subset of columns, and assign them a single color, ensuring that the grid is covered by filled rows and columns.

But I'm stuck.

Wait, perhaps another angle: Since the grid is maximal, every empty cell is in a filled row or filled column.

Therefore, the set of empty cells is the complement of the union of filled rows and filled columns.

But filled rows are those that have at least one chip, and filled columns are those that have at least one chip.

Therefore, the set of empty cells is the complement of (filled rows ∪ filled columns).

But in this case, the grid is determined by the sets of filled rows and filled columns.

Each filled row is assigned a color (W or B), and each filled column is assigned a color (W or B).

But the color assignments must be consistent: if a filled row is W, all filled columns intersecting it must be W; similarly, if a filled column is B, all filled rows intersecting it must be B.

Therefore, the colors of filled rows and filled columns must form a rectangle where the intersection is the same color.

This suggests that the grid is determined by choosing a subset of rows R and a subset of columns C, and assigning them a single color (W or B), such that R × C is filled with that color, and the rest are empty.

But if R and C are non-empty, then their intersection is filled with that color.

Wait, but then the grid can have both white and black regions, as long as they don't overlap.

Therefore, the number of such grids is the number of ways to choose R and C, and assign a color to R × C, and choose another R' and C' (complements of R and C) and assign a color to R' × C'.

But since R' and C' are uniquely determined by R and C, the number of configurations is 2^5 × 2^5 ×2= 2^11=2048. But this counts both color assignments for R × C and R' × C', which can be independently chosen.

But in reality, R' × C' can be assigned a color only if it's non-empty.

Wait, no. Because if R × C is white, then R' × C' can be black.

But the colors are independent as long as they don't overlap.

But in this case, the number of configurations is (number of ways to choose R and color) × (number of ways to choose C and color), but this seems too high.

Alternatively, let's think of it as two independent choices:

1. Choose a white rectangle: select some rows and some columns, assign white to their intersection.

2. Choose a black rectangle: select some rows (disjoint from white rows) and some columns (disjoint from white columns), assign black to their intersection.

But the rows and columns for black can be any subsets of the remaining rows and columns.

But in this case, the number of configurations would be the sum over k=0 to5, l=0 to5 of (number of ways to choose k rows and l columns for white) multiplied by (number of ways to choose (5 -k) rows and (5 -l) columns for black).

But this seems like:

Total = sum_{k=0 to5} sum_{l=0 to5} [C(5, k) * C(5, l) * C(5 -k, 5 -k) * C(5 -l, 5 -l)} ]

Wait, no, that's not correct.

Alternatively, for each possible white rectangle (k rows, l columns), the black rectangle can be any (m rows, n columns) where m ≤5 -k, n ≤5 -l.

But this seems too involved.

Alternatively, since the white and black regions are determined by choosing R_w, C_w, R_b, C_b with R_w ∩ R_b = empty, and C_w ∩ C_b = empty, the number of configurations is:

sum_{R_w, C_w} [1 if R_b × C_b is non-conflicting else 0]

But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the number of configurations is equal to the number of ways to choose R_w and C_w, where R_w is a subset of rows, C_w is a subset of columns, and R_b = all rows not in R_w, C_b = all columns not in C_w. Then, the black region is R_b × C_b, which is non-overlapping with white.

But in this case, the number of such configurations is indeed 2^5 ×2^5=1024.

But as in the 1x1 case, some of these configurations are not maximal.

Therefore, perhaps the answer is 1024, but I'm uncertain because of the 1x1 case discrepancy.

But given the problem's complexity, and considering that in the 5x5 grid, the maximal condition is satisfied for all 1024 configurations except the empty grid, which isn't possible in this model, perhaps the answer is 1024.

But I'm not entirely confident because the 1x1 case suggests otherwise.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct count is 2*(2^5 + 2^5 -1) = 62, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach: For the grid to be maximal, it must be that there are no empty rows and no empty columns. Because if there were an empty row, you could add a chip in that row, which would require the column to be set to that color, potentially allowing more chips.

Wait, no, because if a row is empty, adding a chip would require that the entire row becomes that color, which would conflict with any columns that are already filled.

Wait, but if a row is empty, and a column is empty, their intersection is empty, and you could add a chip there, violating the maximality.

Therefore, to be maximal, the grid cannot have both empty rows and empty columns.

Therefore, either all rows are filled, or all columns are filled.

So, the grid is either:

1. All rows are filled (each row is white or black), and there are no empty columns.

2. All columns are filled (each column is white or black), and there are no empty rows.

This is a key insight.

Therefore, the number of maximal grids is equal to:

- The number of ways to color all rows with white or black, leading to all columns being filled.

- Plus the number of ways to color all columns with white or black, leading to all rows being filled.

But wait, these two cases overlap when all rows and columns are filled, which is when the entire grid is monochromatic.

So, the total number is:

Number of row colorings + number of column colorings - number of monochromatic grids.

Number of row colorings: Each row can be white or black, so 2^5=32.

Similarly, number of column colorings: 2^5=32.

Number of monochromatic grids: 2 (all white or all black).

Therefore, total maximal grids: 32 +32 -2=62.

But wait, in the 1x1 case, this would give 2 +2 -2=2, which matches the correct count.

So, this seems promising.

But let's test it for a 2x2 grid.

In a 2x2 grid, the number of maximal grids would be 2^2 +2^2 -2=4 +4 -2=6.

But let's list them:

1. All rows white: two possibilities (each row can be white or black). Wait, no, if all rows are filled, each row can be white or black independently.

Wait, no, in the row coloring approach, each row is independently white or black, leading to 2^2=4 possibilities.

Similarly, column colorings give another 4.

But subtract the two monochromatic grids (all white and all black).

So, total=4+4-2=6.

Let's list them:

Row colorings:

1. Both rows white: results in all columns being white.

2. First row white, second row black: columns must be white in first row and black in second row.

3. First row black, second row white: similar to 2.

4. Both rows black: all columns black.

Column colorings:

5. Both columns white: all rows white.

6. First column white, second column black: rows must be white in first column and black in second.

7. First column black, second column white: similar to 6.

8. Both columns black: all rows black.

But wait, some of these are duplicates.

For example, case 2 (first row white, second row black) corresponds to columns being white in first row and black in second. Similarly, case 6 (first column white, second column black) corresponds to rows being white in first column and black in second.

But in the 2x2 grid, these are different configurations.

Wait, in the row coloring approach, case 2: rows 1 white, row 2 black. Therefore, columns must be white in row 1 and black in row 2. So, the grid is:

W W

B B

Similarly, case 6: columns 1 white, column 2 black. Therefore, rows must be white in column 1 and black in column 2. So, the grid is:

W B

W B

These are different configurations.

Similarly, case 3 is rows 1 black, row 2 white:

B B

W W

And case 7 is columns 1 black, column 2 white:

B W

B W

So, in total, the row colorings give four grids:

1. All white.

2. Rows 1 white, row 2 black.

3. Rows 1 black, row 2 white.

4. All black.

Similarly, column colorings give four grids:

5. All white.

6. Columns 1 white, column 2 black.

7. Columns 1 black, column 2 white.

8. All black.

But grids 1 and 5 are the same (all white). Similarly, grids 4 and 8 are the same (all black).

So, the total number of unique grids is 4 (from rows) +4 (from columns) -2 (duplicates) =6.

Which matches the earlier calculation.

So, the formula seems correct.

Therefore, for the 5x5 grid, the number of maximal grids is 2^5 (row colorings) +2^5 (column colorings) -2 (monochromatic grids) =32 +32 -2=62.

Therefore, the answer is 62.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To solve the problem, we need to count the number of ways to place chips on a 5x5 grid such that each row and column is monochromatic (all white, all black, or empty) and the grid is maximal, meaning no additional chip can be placed without violating the conditions.

### Key Insights:
1. **Monochromatic Rows and Columns**: Each row and column can be all white, all black, or empty. If a row is non-empty, all its chips must be the same color, and similarly for columns.
2. **Maximality Condition**: The grid must be such that any empty cell is in a filled row or a filled column. This ensures that adding any chip would violate the row or column condition.
3. **Two Cases for Maximality**:
   - **All Rows Filled**: Each row is either white or black, and all columns are filled as a result.
   - **All Columns Filled**: Each column is either white or black, and all rows are filled as a result.
4. **Overlap Subtraction**: The cases where all rows and columns are filled (monochromatic grids) are counted twice, so we subtract them once.

### Calculation:
- **Row Colorings**: Each of the 5 rows can independently be white or black, giving \(2^5 = 32\) possibilities.
- **Column Colorings**: Each of the 5 columns can independently be white or black, giving \(2^5 = 32\) possibilities.
- **Monochromatic Grids**: There are 2 such grids (all white and all black).

Thus, the total number of maximal grids is:
\[
32 + 32 - 2 = 62
\]

### Final Answer:
The number of ways to place the chips is \(\boxed{62}\).
