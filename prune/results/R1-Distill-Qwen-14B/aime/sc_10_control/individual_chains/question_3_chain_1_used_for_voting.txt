Okay, so I'm trying to solve this probability problem about Jen and the lottery. Let me read it again carefully.

Jen picks 4 distinct numbers from the set S = {1,2,3,...,9,10}. Then, 4 numbers are randomly chosen from S. She wins a prize if at least two of her numbers are among the four chosen. She wins the grand prize if all four of her numbers are the ones chosen. The question is asking for the probability that she wins the grand prize given that she won a prize. They mention that this probability is m/n, where m and n are coprime, and we need to find m + n.

Alright, so I think this is a conditional probability problem. The formula for conditional probability is P(A|B) = P(A ∩ B) / P(B). In this case, event A is winning the grand prize, and event B is winning a prize. Since winning the grand prize requires all four numbers to match, which is a subset of winning a prize (since having all four correct implies at least two correct), the intersection A ∩ B is just A. So, P(A|B) = P(A) / P(B).

So, I need to compute P(A) and P(B). Let's figure out how to calculate these probabilities.

First, the total number of possible ways to choose 4 numbers from S. Since S has 10 numbers, the total number of possible combinations is C(10,4). Let me compute that: 10 choose 4 is 210. So, the denominator for both probabilities will be 210.

Now, P(A) is the probability that all four of Jen's numbers are chosen. Since Jen has picked a specific set of 4 numbers, the number of favorable outcomes is 1 (only one combination where all four are correct). So, P(A) = 1 / 210.

Next, P(B) is the probability that at least two of Jen's numbers are chosen. This is a bit trickier. To find P(B), it's easier to compute 1 minus the probability of not having at least two numbers chosen, which means having zero or one of her numbers chosen. 

So, P(B) = 1 - [P(0 correct) + P(1 correct)].

Let me calculate P(0 correct) first. That's the probability that none of Jen's numbers are chosen. Since she picked 4 numbers, there are 10 - 4 = 6 numbers that are not hers. So, the number of ways to choose 4 numbers from the 6 non-Jen numbers is C(6,4). Let me compute that: 6 choose 4 is 15. So, P(0 correct) = 15 / 210.

Now, P(1 correct) is the probability that exactly one of her numbers is chosen. To compute this, we can think of it as choosing 1 number from Jen's 4, and the remaining 3 numbers from the 6 non-Jen numbers. So, the number of favorable outcomes is C(4,1) * C(6,3). Let's compute that: 4 choose 1 is 4, and 6 choose 3 is 20. So, 4 * 20 = 80. Therefore, P(1 correct) = 80 / 210.

Wait, hold on, 80? Let me verify that. So, 6 choose 3 is 20, yes, and 4 choose 1 is 4, so 4*20=80. That seems right.

So, putting it together, P(B) = 1 - (15/210 + 80/210). Let's compute that:

15 + 80 = 95, so 95/210. Therefore, 1 - 95/210 = (210 - 95)/210 = 115/210.

Simplify 115/210: both divisible by 5, so 23/42. So, P(B) is 23/42.

Wait a minute, but let me double-check the numbers because sometimes it's easy to miscalculate combinations.

Wait, the total number of ways is 210, correct. P(0 correct) is 15/210, that's right. P(1 correct) is 80/210, correct. So, 15+80=95, so 115/210 for P(B). Simplify 115/210: 115 divided by 5 is 23, 210 divided by 5 is 42. So, 23/42. That's correct.

So, P(A) is 1/210, P(B) is 23/42. So, the conditional probability P(A|B) is (1/210) divided by (23/42).

Let me compute that. Dividing by a fraction is the same as multiplying by its reciprocal, so:

(1/210) * (42/23) = (42)/(210*23) = (42)/(4830).

Simplify 42 and 4830: 42 divides by 42, 4830 divided by 42 is 4830 ÷ 42. Let's compute that: 42*115=4830 because 42*100=4200, 42*15=630, 4200+630=4830. So, 42/4830 = 1/115.

Wait, wait, hold on. Wait, 1/210 divided by 23/42 is (1/210)*(42/23) = (42)/(210*23). But 42 is a factor of 210. 210 divided by 42 is 5. So, 42/(210*23) = 1/(5*23) = 1/115.

So, P(A|B) is 1/115.

Wait, but that seems very low. Is that correct?

Let me think again. So, given that she won a prize, which means at least two correct numbers, what's the probability she actually has all four correct? So, in the space where she has at least two correct, how likely is it that she has all four?

Intuitively, it's rare because having four correct is a much more stringent condition. So, 1/115 seems plausible.

But let me think again, step by step.

Total possible combinations: 210.

Number of ways she can have at least two correct: 115 (since P(B) is 115/210). So, the number of favorable outcomes for event B is 115.

Within those 115, how many correspond to event A (all four correct)? Just 1.

So, the conditional probability is 1/115. So, that's correct.

Therefore, m is 1, n is 115. Are 1 and 115 coprime? Yes, because 115 is 5*23, and 1 shares no common factors besides 1. So, m + n is 1 + 115 = 116.

Wait, wait, but I'm a bit confused. Because in the problem statement, they say "the probability of her winning the grand prize given that she won a prize", which is P(A|B). So, my calculation comes out to 1/115, which would be m/n = 1/115, so m + n is 116.

But let me double-check my calculations because it's easy to make a mistake in combinatorics.

So, P(A) is 1/210.

P(B) is the probability of at least two correct numbers. So, another way to compute P(B) is to calculate the number of ways to have exactly 2, exactly 3, or exactly 4 correct numbers.

Wait, that's another approach. Maybe I should compute it that way to make sure.

Number of ways to have exactly 2 correct: C(4,2) * C(6,2). Because you choose 2 correct from Jen's 4, and 2 incorrect from the 6 non-Jen numbers.

C(4,2) is 6, C(6,2) is 15. So, 6*15=90.

Number of ways to have exactly 3 correct: C(4,3) * C(6,1). C(4,3)=4, C(6,1)=6. So, 4*6=24.

Number of ways to have exactly 4 correct: 1, as before.

So, total number of favorable outcomes for B is 90 + 24 + 1 = 115, which matches my previous computation. So, P(B) is 115/210.

So, that's correct.

Therefore, P(A|B) is 1/115, so m + n is 1 + 115 = 116.

Wait, but 1/115 seems a bit low, but given that winning a prize includes a lot more cases, I think it's correct.

Alright, so I think that's the solution.

To solve the problem, we need to find the probability that Jen wins the grand prize given that she won a prize. This is a conditional probability problem where we calculate \( P(A|B) \), with \( A \) being the event of winning the grand prize and \( B \) being the event of winning a prize.

1. **Total number of possible combinations**:  
   The total number of ways to choose 4 numbers from 10 is \( \binom{10}{4} = 210 \).

2. **Probability of winning the grand prize (P(A))**:  
   There is only 1 way to choose all 4 of Jen's numbers. Thus,  
   \[
   P(A) = \frac{1}{210}.
   \]

3. **Probability of winning a prize (P(B))**:  
   This is the probability of having at least 2 correct numbers. We calculate this by subtracting the probabilities of having 0 or 1 correct numbers from 1.  
   - **0 correct numbers**: The number of ways to choose 4 numbers from the 6 non-Jen numbers is \( \binom{6}{4} = 15 \).  
     \[
     P(0 \text{ correct}) = \frac{15}{210}.
     \]
   - **1 correct number**: The number of ways to choose 1 correct number from Jen's 4 and 3 incorrect numbers from the 6 non-Jen numbers is \( \binom{4}{1} \times \binom{6}{3} = 4 \times 20 = 80 \).  
     \[
     P(1 \text{ correct}) = \frac{80}{210}.
     \]
   - Therefore,  
     \[
     P(B) = 1 - \left( \frac{15}{210} + \frac{80}{210} \right) = 1 - \frac{95}{210} = \frac{115}{210} = \frac{23}{42}.
     \]

4. **Conditional probability \( P(A|B) \)**:  
   Using the formula \( P(A|B) = \frac{P(A \cap B)}{P(B)} \), and since \( A \) is a subset of \( B \),  
   \[
   P(A|B) = \frac{P(A)}{P(B)} = \frac{\frac{1}{210}}{\frac{23}{42}} = \frac{1}{210} \times \frac{42}{23} = \frac{1}{115}.
   \]

5. **Simplifying the fraction**:  
   The fraction \( \frac{1}{115} \) is already in its simplest form, with \( m = 1 \) and \( n = 115 \). Thus, \( m + n = 1 + 115 = 116 \).

The final answer is \( \boxed{116} \).
