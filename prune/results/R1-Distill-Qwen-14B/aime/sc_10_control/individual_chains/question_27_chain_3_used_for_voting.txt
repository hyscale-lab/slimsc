Okay, so I've got this problem about a torus and a sphere. Hmm, I remember a torus is like a donut shape, created by rotating a circle around an axis. The problem says the torus T has a radius of 3, and the axis is 6 units away from the center of the circle. Then there's a sphere S with radius 11. The question is about the difference between two radii: r_i, which is the radius of the circle where T is internally tangent to S, and r_o, the radius when T is externally tangent. I need to find r_i - r_o and express it as a fraction m/n, then find m + n.

Alright, let's break this down. First, understanding the torus. I know a torus can be described in terms of two radii: the major radius R, which is the distance from the center of the generating circle to the axis of revolution, and the minor radius r, which is the radius of the generating circle itself. In this problem, the generating circle has radius 3, and the major radius R is 6. So R = 6, r = 3.

Now, the sphere S has radius 11. So when the torus is inside the sphere, they're tangent along a circle, and when it's outside, they're tangent along another circle. I need to find the radii of these circles, r_i and r_o, and then find the difference.

I think I should visualize how the torus and sphere can be tangent. When the torus is inside the sphere, the closest point on the torus to the center of the sphere will be along the axis of the torus. Similarly, when it's outside, the farthest point on the torus from the sphere's center will be along the same axis.

Wait, maybe I should model this mathematically. Let me consider the centers of both the sphere and the torus. Let's set up a coordinate system where the center of the sphere S is at the origin (0,0,0). The torus T can be positioned such that its own center (the center of the generating circle) is along the z-axis at (0,0, c), where c is the distance from the sphere's center to the torus's center.

Wait, but when the torus is resting on the inside of the sphere, the center of the torus must be inside the sphere. Similarly, when it's resting on the outside, the center would be outside the sphere.

Wait, no. Actually, when the torus is internally tangent, the center of the torus is inside the sphere. So the distance from the sphere's center to the torus's center plus the torus's "reach" equals the sphere's radius. Hmm, maybe I need to think about the distance between the centers.

Let me think. For internal tangency, the sphere and torus touch at exactly one point (well, a circle, but in this case, perhaps a single point in some projection), but actually, in three dimensions, they touch along a circle. Hmm, maybe I should consider the centers.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to model the torus as a surface of revolution and then find the points of tangency with the sphere.

Wait, maybe I should use the concept of the distance from the sphere's center to the torus's surface. The sphere S has radius 11, so any point on the torus must satisfy the equation of the sphere. But the torus is itself a surface, so perhaps I can find the points where the torus and sphere are tangent, which would involve their gradients being equal.

Wait, maybe I can parametrize the torus. The standard parametrization for a torus with major radius R and minor radius r is:

x = (R + r cos θ) cos φ
y = (R + r cos θ) sin φ
z = r sin θ

Where θ and φ are angles varying from 0 to 2π. So in this case, R = 6, r = 3.

So the parametrization becomes:

x = (6 + 3 cos θ) cos φ
y = (6 + 3 cos θ) sin φ
z = 3 sin θ

Now, the sphere S is centered at the origin with radius 11, so the equation is x² + y² + z² = 11² = 121.

For the torus to be tangent to the sphere, there must be points on the torus that lie on the sphere, and at those points, the normals to both surfaces are equal, implying that the gradients are colinear. Alternatively, perhaps I can find the points where the distance from the origin to a point on the torus is equal to 11, and the derivative conditions (for tangency) are satisfied.

But this seems a bit complicated. Maybe there's a simpler approach.

Wait, perhaps I can model the problem by considering the centers. The torus is a surface of revolution around the z-axis, and the sphere is centered at the origin. So when the torus is inside the sphere, the point on the torus closest to the origin would lie along the z-axis. Similarly, when it's outside, the farthest point would lie along the z-axis.

So let's consider the distance from the origin to a point on the torus along the z-axis. For the internal tangency, the point on the torus closest to the origin must lie on the sphere, so its distance from the origin is 11. Similarly, for external tangency, the point on the torus farthest from the origin must lie on the sphere, so its distance is 11.

Wait, but let me think. The closest point on the torus to the origin would be at the inner part of the torus. The torus is generated by rotating a circle of radius 3 around the z-axis, which is 6 units away from the center of that circle. So the closest point on the torus to the origin would be along the z-axis at (0,0,6 - 3) = (0,0,3). The distance from the origin to this point is 3. Similarly, the farthest point would be at (0,0,6 + 3) = (0,0,9), with distance 9.

Wait, but that can't be right because the sphere has radius 11. If the torus's closest point is only at 3 units from the origin, then placing the torus inside the sphere would have the closest point at 3, which is much less than 11. So perhaps I'm misunderstanding the positioning.

Wait, maybe the torus is not centered along the same axis as the sphere. Oh wait, no, when the torus is inside the sphere, the center of the torus (the center of the generating circle) is at some point relative to the sphere's center. But perhaps I'm complicating it.

Wait, let me try to clarify. When the torus is placed inside the sphere, it's touching the sphere along a circle. The points of tangency would occur where the torus's surface is just touching the sphere's surface. So the distance from the origin to any point on that circle of tangency should be 11.

But perhaps it's better to model the torus as being offset from the origin. Wait, maybe I should consider the distance from the origin to the center of the generating circle of the torus, which is at (0,0, c), where c is some value.

Wait, but actually, when the torus is placed inside the sphere, the center of the torus's generating circle would be at (0,0, k), where k is such that the closest point on the torus to the origin is at a distance of 11 - something.

Wait, maybe I should find the maximum and minimum distances from the origin to the torus, and set those equal to 11 for internal and external tangency.

Wait, let's think about the distance from the origin to a general point on the torus. Using the parametrization I wrote earlier:

x = (6 + 3 cos θ) cos φ
y = (6 + 3 cos θ) sin φ
z = 3 sin θ

So the distance squared from the origin is:

x² + y² + z² = (6 + 3 cos θ)^2 (cos² φ + sin² φ) + (3 sin θ)^2
= (6 + 3 cos θ)^2 + (3 sin θ)^2
= 36 + 36 cos θ + 9 cos² θ + 9 sin² θ
= 36 + 36 cos θ + 9 (cos² θ + sin² θ)
= 36 + 36 cos θ + 9 (1)
= 36 + 36 cos θ + 9
= 45 + 36 cos θ

So the distance squared is 45 + 36 cos θ.

We can find the maximum and minimum values of this expression as θ varies from 0 to 2π.

Since cos θ varies between -1 and 1, the expression 45 + 36 cos θ will vary between 45 - 36 = 9 and 45 + 36 = 81.

So the minimum distance from the origin to the torus is sqrt(9) = 3, and the maximum is sqrt(81) = 9.

Wait, that can't be right because the sphere has radius 11, which is much larger. So perhaps I'm misunderstanding how the torus is placed relative to the sphere.

Wait a second, maybe the center of the torus's generating circle is not at (0,0,0) but at some other point relative to the sphere. Because if the torus is inside the sphere, its center must be inside the sphere, but perhaps the sphere is larger, so the torus can be placed such that its closest and farthest points from the origin are both on the sphere.

Wait, maybe the torus is placed such that it is tangent to the sphere along a circle, which would mean that the sphere's center is offset from the torus's center.

Hmm, perhaps I should model the torus as being at a certain distance from the sphere's center. Let me denote the center of the generating circle of the torus as point C, located at (0,0, h), where h is the distance along the z-axis from the origin.

Now, the distance from the origin to point C is |h|. The torus is then the set of points at a distance of 3 from C, but moving around the z-axis. So the distance from the origin to any point on the torus would vary depending on where on the torus we are.

Wait, perhaps I can model the minimum and maximum distances from the origin to the torus when it's placed inside and outside the sphere.

Wait, when the torus is inside the sphere, the closest point on the torus to the origin is at a distance of |h| - 3, and the farthest is |h| + 3. But in this case, the sphere has radius 11, so perhaps when the torus is inside, the farthest point on the torus is just touching the sphere. Similarly, when it's outside, the closest point on the torus is just touching the sphere.

Wait, no. When the torus is inside the sphere, the maximum distance from the origin to the torus would be equal to the sphere's radius, because that's where they touch. Similarly, when the torus is outside, the minimum distance would be equal to the sphere's radius.

So let's model it that way.

Case 1: Torus inside the sphere, externally tangent (wait, no, internal tangency). So when the torus is inside, it's touching the sphere along a circle where the distance from the origin is 11. So the maximum distance from the origin to the torus is 11.

Similarly, when the torus is outside, the minimum distance from the origin to the torus is 11.

Wait, but earlier, without considering the position h, the maximum distance from the origin to the torus was 9. But the sphere's radius is 11, so perhaps the torus is not centered at the origin. So maybe the center of the torus's generating circle is at (0,0, h), so that the maximum and minimum distances from the origin to the torus include this h.

Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of the center of the generating circle being at (0,0, h), so that the torus is shifted along the z-axis by h.

In that case, any point on the torus can be described in cylindrical coordinates as (r, φ, z), where r is the radial distance in the xy-plane, φ is the angle, and z is the height along the z-axis.

Wait, but the torus is created by rotating a circle of radius 3 around the z-axis, which is at a distance of 6 from the center of that circle. Wait, that's confusing. Let me clarify.

The torus is formed by rotating a circle of radius 3 around an axis that is 6 units away from the center of the circle. So in this case, the major radius R is 6, and the minor radius r is 3. So the standard parametrization would be:

x = (R + r cos θ) cos φ
y = (R + r cos θ) sin φ
z = r sin θ

But if the center of this generating circle is at (0,0, h), then perhaps the parametrization shifts. Wait, no, the standard parametrization already assumes the generating circle is centered on the z-axis. So perhaps the entire torus is shifted along the z-axis by h units.

Wait, no, the standard parametrization is for a torus centered at the origin, with the generating circle in the x-y plane. If we shift it up along the z-axis by h, then the parametrization would be:

x = (R + r cos θ) cos φ
y = (R + r cos θ) sin φ
z = h + r sin θ

So now, the center of the generating circle is at (0,0,h), and the torus is shifted along the z-axis by h.

Now, the distance from the origin to a general point on this torus is sqrt(x² + y² + z²) which is sqrt[(R + r cos θ)^2 + (h + r sin θ)^2]. Let's compute this:

= sqrt( (R + r cos θ)^2 + (h + r sin θ)^2 )
= sqrt( R² + 2 R r cos θ + r² cos² θ + h² + 2 h r sin θ + r² sin² θ )
= sqrt( R² + h² + 2 R r cos θ + r² (cos² θ + sin² θ) + 2 h r sin θ )
= sqrt( R² + h² + 2 R r cos θ + r² + 2 h r sin θ )

Since R = 6, r = 3, substitute:

= sqrt( 6² + h² + 2*6*3 cos θ + 3² + 2 h*3 sin θ )
= sqrt( 36 + h² + 36 cos θ + 9 + 6 h sin θ )
= sqrt( (36 + 9) + h² + 36 cos θ + 6 h sin θ )
= sqrt(45 + h² + 36 cos θ + 6 h sin θ )

Now, for the torus to be tangent to the sphere S (radius 11), the distance from the origin to the torus must be 11 at the point of tangency. Since the torus is a surface, the points of tangency will lie where the gradient vectors of the torus and the sphere are colinear.

But perhaps a simpler approach is to find the minimum and maximum distances from the origin to the torus and set them equal to 11 for internal and external tangency.

Wait, but the sphere has radius 11, so when the torus is inside the sphere, the maximum distance from the origin to the torus would be 11, and when it's outside, the minimum distance would be 11.

So for internal tangency, the maximum distance from the origin to the torus is 11. For external tangency, the minimum distance is 11.

So let's find the maximum and minimum of the expression inside the sqrt, which is 45 + h² + 36 cos θ + 6 h sin θ.

The expression inside the sqrt is 45 + h² + 36 cos θ + 6 h sin θ. Let's denote this as D(θ) = 45 + h² + 36 cos θ + 6 h sin θ.

We can write this as D(θ) = (45 + h²) + 36 cos θ + 6 h sin θ.

Now, to find the maximum and minimum values of D(θ), we can consider it as a function of θ. The maximum and minimum of A cos θ + B sin θ is sqrt(A² + B²). So here, A = 36, B = 6h.

So the maximum of 36 cos θ + 6h sin θ is sqrt(36² + (6h)^2) = sqrt(1296 + 36 h²).

Similarly, the minimum is -sqrt(1296 + 36 h²).

So the maximum value of D(θ) is (45 + h²) + sqrt(1296 + 36 h²).

The minimum value of D(θ) is (45 + h²) - sqrt(1296 + 36 h²).

Now, since the distance from the origin must be 11 at the point of tangency, the maximum D(θ) for internal tangency would be 11² = 121, and the minimum D(θ) for external tangency would be 121.

Wait, no. For internal tangency, the maximum distance from the origin to the torus is 11, because that's where the sphere touches the torus. So:

(45 + h²) + sqrt(1296 + 36 h²) = 121

Similarly, for external tangency, the minimum distance is 11:

(45 + h²) - sqrt(1296 + 36 h²) = 121

Wait, no, that can't be right because the minimum would be less than the maximum. Wait, wait, no, when the torus is outside the sphere, the closest point on the torus to the origin would be 11. So for external tangency, the minimum distance is 11, so:

(45 + h²) - sqrt(1296 + 36 h²) = 121.

Wait, but that would give a negative sqrt, which doesn't make sense. Hmm, perhaps I got it the other way around.

Wait, when the torus is inside the sphere, the maximum distance from the origin to the torus is 11, so:

(45 + h²) + sqrt(1296 + 36 h²) = 121.

And when the torus is outside, the minimum distance is 11, so:

(45 + h²) - sqrt(1296 + 36 h²) = 121.

But wait, that would lead to:

For internal tangency:
(45 + h²) + sqrt(1296 + 36 h²) = 121.

For external tangency:
(45 + h²) - sqrt(1296 + 36 h²) = 121.

Wait, but solving the internal tangency equation:

Let me denote sqrt(1296 + 36 h²) as S for simplicity.

So 45 + h² + S = 121.

Then, S = 121 - 45 - h² = 76 - h².

But S = sqrt(1296 + 36 h²) = 76 - h².

Square both sides:

1296 + 36 h² = (76 - h²)^2 = 76^2 - 2*76*h² + h^4.

Compute 76^2: 76*76 = 5776.

So:

1296 + 36 h² = 5776 - 152 h² + h^4.

Bring all terms to one side:

h^4 - 152 h² - 36 h² - 5776 + 1296 = 0

Simplify:

h^4 - (152 + 36) h² + (5776 - 1296) = 0

h^4 - 188 h² + 4480 = 0.

Let me write this as a quadratic in terms of h²:

Let u = h².

Equation becomes:

u² - 188 u + 4480 = 0.

Solve using quadratic formula:

u = [188 ± sqrt(188^2 - 4*1*4480)] / 2.

Compute discriminant:

188^2 = (200 - 12)^2 = 200^2 - 2*200*12 + 12^2 = 40000 - 4800 + 144 = 35344.

4*1*4480 = 17920.

So sqrt(35344 - 17920) = sqrt(17424).

What's sqrt(17424)? Let me compute:

132^2 = 17,424. Yes, because 130^2=16,900, 131^2=17,161, 132^2=17,424.

So sqrt(17424) = 132.

Thus, u = [188 ± 132]/2.

Compute both possibilities:

u1 = (188 + 132)/2 = 320/2 = 160.

u2 = (188 - 132)/2 = 56/2 = 28.

So h² = 160 or h² = 28.

But h is the distance from the origin to the center of the generating circle of the torus. When the torus is inside the sphere, h must be such that the center is inside the sphere. So h must be less than 11.

Compute h for u = 160: h = sqrt(160) ≈ 12.649, which is greater than 11. But the torus is inside the sphere, so h should be less than 11. So this solution might not be acceptable.

For u = 28: h² = 28 → h = sqrt(28) ≈ 5.2915, which is less than 11. So this is acceptable.

So for internal tangency, h = sqrt(28).

Now, let's check the external tangency case.

External tangency: the minimum distance from the origin to the torus is 11.

So:

(45 + h²) - sqrt(1296 + 36 h²) = 121.

Wait, but 45 + h² - sqrt(1296 + 36 h²) = 121.

Let's rearrange:

sqrt(1296 + 36 h²) = 45 + h² - 121 = h² - 76.

So sqrt(1296 + 36 h²) = h² - 76.

Now, since sqrt(...) is non-negative, h² - 76 must be ≥ 0 → h² ≥ 76.

Square both sides:

1296 + 36 h² = (h² - 76)^2 = h^4 - 152 h² + 5776.

Bring all terms to one side:

h^4 - 152 h² - 36 h² - 5776 + 1296 = 0

Wait, same as before:

h^4 - 188 h² + 4480 = 0.

Which is the same equation as before, leading to u = 160 and u = 28.

But in this case, h² must satisfy h² ≥ 76. So h² = 160 is acceptable, since 160 > 76. h² = 28 is less than 76, so it's not acceptable for external tangency.

So for external tangency, h² = 160 → h = sqrt(160) = 4 sqrt(10), which is approximately 12.649, which is greater than 11, which makes sense for external placement.

So now, for internal tangency, when the torus is inside the sphere, the center of the generating circle is at h = sqrt(28) ≈ 5.2915.

For external tangency, the center is at h = sqrt(160) ≈ 12.649.

Now, the problem mentions the circles along which the torus is tangent to the sphere. These are circles on the sphere where the torus touches. The radii of these circles, r_i and r_o, are the radii of the circles of tangency on the sphere.

Wait, but how to find r_i and r_o?

Hmm, perhaps it's better to think about the points where the torus and sphere are tangent. At these points, the tangent planes to both surfaces are the same, meaning the normals are colinear.

Alternatively, perhaps I can find the angle θ where the point on the torus lies on the sphere and the derivative conditions are satisfied.

Wait, let me consider the point of tangency. The point lies on both the sphere and the torus, so it satisfies both equations.

But wait, perhaps I can use the fact that the gradient vectors of the sphere and torus at the point of tangency are colinear.

The sphere's gradient at a point (x,y,z) is (2x, 2y, 2z).

The torus, being a level set F(x,y,z) = 0, where F is the parametrized equation. But perhaps it's easier to find the gradient of the torus in terms of θ and φ.

Wait, using the parametrization:

x = (6 + 3 cos θ) cos φ
y = (6 + 3 cos θ) sin φ
z = 3 sin θ

So, let me compute the partial derivatives of x, y, z with respect to θ and φ.

Partial derivatives with respect to θ:

dx/dθ = -3 sin θ cos φ
dy/dθ = -3 sin θ sin φ
dz/dθ = 3 cos θ

Partial derivatives with respect to φ:

dx/dφ = (6 + 3 cos θ) (-sin φ)
dy/dφ = (6 + 3 cos θ) cos φ
dz/dφ = 0

The gradient vector of the torus at a point (θ, φ) is the cross product of the partial derivatives with respect to θ and φ.

So, gradient = (dx/dθ, dy/dθ, dz/dθ) × (dx/dφ, dy/dφ, dz/dφ).

Let me compute this cross product:

i component: (dy/dθ * dz/dφ - dz/dθ * dy/dφ)
= (-3 sin θ sin φ * 0 - 3 cos θ * (6 + 3 cos θ) cos φ)
= -3 cos θ (6 + 3 cos θ) cos φ

j component: -(dx/dθ * dz/dφ - dz/dθ * dx/dφ)
= -[ (-3 sin θ cos φ * 0) - 3 cos θ * (6 + 3 cos θ) (-sin φ) )
= -[ 0 + 3 cos θ (6 + 3 cos θ) sin φ ]
= -3 cos θ (6 + 3 cos θ) sin φ

k component: (dx/dθ * dy/dφ - dy/dθ * dx/dφ)
= [ (-3 sin θ cos φ) * (6 + 3 cos θ) cos φ ) - (-3 sin θ sin φ) * (6 + 3 cos θ) (-sin φ) ) ]
= [ -3 sin θ (6 + 3 cos θ) cos² φ - 3 sin θ (6 + 3 cos θ) sin² φ ]
= -3 sin θ (6 + 3 cos θ) (cos² φ + sin² φ)
= -3 sin θ (6 + 3 cos θ) * 1
= -3 sin θ (6 + 3 cos θ)

So the gradient vector is:

( -3 cos θ (6 + 3 cos θ) cos φ, -3 cos θ (6 + 3 cos θ) sin φ, -3 sin θ (6 + 3 cos θ) )

We can factor out -3 (6 + 3 cos θ):

= -3 (6 + 3 cos θ) (cos θ cos φ, cos θ sin φ, sin θ )

The gradient of the sphere at (x,y,z) is (2x, 2y, 2z). So at the point of tangency, the gradient of the torus must be a scalar multiple of the gradient of the sphere.

So, the gradient of the torus is proportional to (x, y, z). Let's see:

We have gradient_torus = k * gradient_sphere, where k is some scalar.

So, the components must be proportional:

-3 (6 + 3 cos θ) cos θ cos φ = k * 2 x
-3 (6 + 3 cos θ) cos θ sin φ = k * 2 y
-3 (6 + 3 cos θ) sin θ = k * 2 z

But x = (6 + 3 cos θ) cos φ, y = (6 + 3 cos θ) sin φ, z = 3 sin θ.

So substituting x, y, z:

First component:
-3 (6 + 3 cos θ) cos θ cos φ = k * 2 (6 + 3 cos θ) cos φ

Second component:
-3 (6 + 3 cos θ) cos θ sin φ = k * 2 (6 + 3 cos θ) sin φ

Third component:
-3 (6 + 3 cos θ) sin θ = k * 2 (3 sin θ)

Assuming that (6 + 3 cos θ) ≠ 0 (which it isn't, since 6 + 3 cos θ ≥ 6 - 3 = 3), we can divide both sides by (6 + 3 cos θ):

From first component:
-3 cos θ cos φ = 2 k cos φ

Similarly, second component:
-3 cos θ sin φ = 2 k sin φ

Third component:
-3 sin θ = 6 k sin θ

Wait, third component: -3 (6 + 3 cos θ) sin θ = k * 2 * 3 sin θ → simplifies to -3 (6 + 3 cos θ) sin θ = 6 k sin θ.

But let's see:

Third component equation:
-3 (6 + 3 cos θ) sin θ = 2 k (3 sin θ)
→ -3 (6 + 3 cos θ) sin θ = 6 k sin θ

Divide both sides by sin θ (assuming sin θ ≠ 0; if sin θ = 0, then z = 0, which is possible, but let's first consider sin θ ≠ 0):

→ -3 (6 + 3 cos θ) = 6 k
→ k = [ -3 (6 + 3 cos θ) ] / 6 = [ - (6 + 3 cos θ) ] / 2

Now, from first component:

-3 cos θ cos φ = 2 k cos φ

Substituting k:

-3 cos θ cos φ = 2 * [ - (6 + 3 cos θ)/2 ] cos φ

Simplify RHS:

= [ - (6 + 3 cos θ) ] cos φ

So equation becomes:

-3 cos θ cos φ = - (6 + 3 cos θ) cos φ

Divide both sides by cos φ (assuming cos φ ≠ 0; if cos φ = 0, then x = 0, but let's first assume cos φ ≠ 0):

→ -3 cos θ = - (6 + 3 cos θ)
→ -3 cos θ = -6 - 3 cos θ
→ Adding 3 cos θ to both sides:
0 = -6 → Contradiction.

Hmm, that's a problem. So perhaps cos φ = 0, which would make x = 0. Let me check that case.

If cos φ = 0, then φ = π/2 or 3π/2. Let's take φ = π/2, then y = (6 + 3 cos θ) * 1, x = 0.

So the point on the torus is (0, 6 + 3 cos θ, 3 sin θ).

Wait, but this point must lie on the sphere, so:

0^2 + (6 + 3 cos θ)^2 + (3 sin θ)^2 = 121
Compute:

(6 + 3 cos θ)^2 + 9 sin² θ = 121
36 + 36 cos θ + 9 cos² θ + 9 sin² θ = 121
36 + 36 cos θ + 9 (cos² θ + sin² θ) = 121
36 + 36 cos θ + 9 = 121
45 + 36 cos θ = 121
36 cos θ = 76 → cos θ = 76 / 36 = 19/9 ≈ 2.111, which is impossible because cos θ cannot exceed 1.

So this case is impossible, so cos φ ≠ 0, and we have a contradiction in the earlier equation. Therefore, perhaps our assumption that the gradients are proportional is incorrect, or I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, perhaps I should instead consider that at the point of tangency, the normal vector to the torus is colinear with the normal vector to the sphere. So the normals must point in the same or opposite directions.

Alternatively, perhaps I should set up the equations differently.

Wait, let me try a different approach. Since the point of tangency lies on both the torus and the sphere, and their normals are colinear, perhaps I can find the point where the distance from the origin is 11, and the derivative conditions are satisfied.

Alternatively, perhaps I can find the points where the torus and sphere meet and the tangent planes are the same.

But this seems complicated, maybe I should instead find the angle θ where D(θ) = 121 for internal and external cases.

Wait, earlier I found that for internal tangency, the center of the generating circle is at h = sqrt(28), and for external tangency, h = sqrt(160). Now, perhaps the circles of tangency on the sphere are at a certain height z, which would correspond to the same θ for all points on the circle.

Wait, perhaps the circle of tangency lies in a plane z = k, so all points on this circle have the same z-coordinate. Therefore, the point on the torus where it is tangent to the sphere must have the same z-coordinate, which would correspond to a particular θ.

Alternatively, since the point of tangency is along a circle, maybe θ is the same for all points on that circle. Hmm, but that might not necessarily be the case.

Wait, perhaps I can find the radius of the circle of tangency on the sphere. For a sphere of radius 11, the radius r of a circle at height z is given by r = sqrt(11² - z²) = sqrt(121 - z²).

So if I can find z, the height where the tangency occurs, then I can find r_i and r_o.

Alternatively, perhaps when the torus is inside the sphere, the circle of tangency is at a certain z, and when it's outside, at another z.

Wait, maybe I can find z for the internal and external cases.

From earlier, when the torus is inside the sphere, the center of the generating circle is at h = sqrt(28). So h = sqrt(28) ≈ 5.2915.

The point of tangency on the torus is at maximum distance from the origin, which is 11. So the point on the torus with maximum distance from the origin is at (x, y, z) where z is maximum, perhaps.

Wait, but in the parametrization, when the generating circle is at (0,0, h), the z-coordinate of the torus is z = h + 3 sin θ.

Wait, no, earlier when I shifted the torus, the parametrization became z = h + 3 sin θ. So the maximum z on the torus is h + 3, and the minimum is h - 3.

So for internal tangency, the point of maximum distance from the origin would be along the positive z-axis. So let's compute the distance from the origin to the point (0,0, h + 3):

Wait, no, that's not correct. The point (0,0, h + 3) is on the torus, but the distance from the origin would be |h + 3|.

Wait, but when the torus is inside the sphere, the maximum distance from the origin to the torus is 11. So |h + 3| = 11.

So h + 3 = 11 → h = 8. But earlier, I found h = sqrt(28) ≈ 5.2915, which is not 8. So that suggests a mistake.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the parametrization. Let me re-examine.

Originally, I thought the parametrization of the torus would be:

x = (6 + 3 cos θ) cos φ
y = (6 + 3 cos θ) sin φ
z = h + 3 sin θ

But perhaps this is incorrect because the generating circle is in the plane of revolution. Wait, no, the generating circle is in the x-y plane, but when we shift the center to (0,0,h), then the z-coordinate becomes h + 3 sin θ, which makes sense for the rotation around the z-axis.

Wait, but then the point on the torus at φ = 0, θ = π/2 would be at (6 + 3 cos(π/2), 0, h + 3 sin(π/2)) = (6 + 0, 0, h + 3) = (6, 0, h +3).

So the distance from the origin to this point is sqrt(6^2 + (h +3)^2) = sqrt(36 + (h +3)^2).

We know that for internal tangency, the maximum distance is 11, so sqrt(36 + (h +3)^2) = 11.

Squaring both sides:

36 + (h +3)^2 = 121 → (h +3)^2 = 85 → h +3 = sqrt(85) → h = sqrt(85) - 3.

Similarly, for external tangency, the minimum distance would be 11, which would occur at the point (6,0, h -3), so sqrt(6^2 + (h -3)^2) = 11.

So, 36 + (h -3)^2 = 121 → (h -3)^2 = 85 → h -3 = sqrt(85) → h = sqrt(85) +3.

Wait, but earlier when solving for h, I got h = sqrt(28) for internal tangency and h = sqrt(160) for external. But this approach gives h = sqrt(85) -3 for internal and h = sqrt(85) +3 for external.

This is conflicting. So perhaps I made a mistake in earlier reasoning.

Alternatively, perhaps I should re-express D(θ) correctly.

Wait, in the earlier approach, I considered the torus shifted along the z-axis by h, leading to the distance squared from origin as 45 + h² + 36 cos θ + 6 h sin θ. But perhaps this is incorrect.

Wait, perhaps the correct parametrization after shifting the center along the z-axis is:

x = (6 + 3 cos θ) cos φ
y = (6 + 3 cos θ) sin φ
z = h + 3 sin θ

So, the distance squared is x² + y² + z² = (6 + 3 cos θ)^2 (cos² φ + sin² φ) + (h + 3 sin θ)^2.

Which simplifies to (6 + 3 cos θ)^2 + (h + 3 sin θ)^2.

Compute this:

(6 + 3 cos θ)^2 = 36 + 36 cos θ + 9 cos² θ
(h + 3 sin θ)^2 = h² + 6 h sin θ + 9 sin² θ
Total: 36 + 36 cos θ + 9 cos² θ + h² + 6 h sin θ + 9 sin² θ
= 36 + h² + 36 cos θ + 6 h sin θ + 9 (cos² θ + sin² θ)
= 36 + h² + 36 cos θ + 6 h sin θ + 9
= 45 + h² + 36 cos θ + 6 h sin θ.

So yes, D(θ) is correctly 45 + h² + 36 cos θ + 6 h sin θ.

So the maximum of D(θ) is 45 + h² + sqrt(36^2 + (6 h)^2) = 45 + h² + sqrt(1296 + 36 h²). And the minimum is 45 + h² - sqrt(1296 + 36 h²).

So for internal tangency, maximum D(θ) = 121:

45 + h² + sqrt(1296 + 36 h²) = 121 → sqrt(1296 + 36 h²) = 76 - h².

As before, leading to h² = 28, h = sqrt(28).

Similarly, for external tangency, the minimum D(θ) = 121:

45 + h² - sqrt(1296 + 36 h²) = 121 → sqrt(1296 + 36 h²) = h² - 76.

Which leads to h² = 160, h = sqrt(160).

So with h = sqrt(28) for internal tangency and h = sqrt(160) for external.

Now, the points of tangency would be where D(θ) = 121, and the gradients are colinear.

Wait, but perhaps the circles of tangency lie in planes perpendicular to the line connecting the origin and the center of the generating circle, which is along the z-axis. So the circles would be horizontal circles in the sphere, at a certain z-coordinate.

So the radius of the circle of tangency on the sphere would be sqrt(11^2 - z^2), where z is the height at which the tangency occurs.

So we need to find z for internal and external cases.

In the internal case, the center is at h = sqrt(28). The point of tangency would be at maximum distance from the origin, which is 11. So perhaps the point is at (x, y, z) where z is such that the distance from the origin is 11.

But wait, the maximum distance occurs when cos θ = 1 and sin θ = 0, perhaps? Let me think.

Wait, D(θ) = 45 + h² + 36 cos θ + 6 h sin θ.

To maximize D(θ), we set cos θ = 1, sin θ = 0, so:

D_max = 45 + h² + 36*1 + 6 h*0 = 45 + h² + 36 = 81 + h².

Wait, but earlier we set this equal to 121, so 81 + h² = 121 → h² = 40 → h = sqrt(40) = 2 sqrt(10). But earlier, for internal tangency, we had h² = 28, which is conflicting.

Hmm, perhaps this approach isn't correct because the maximum of D(θ) isn't necessarily at θ = 0.

Wait, perhaps the maximum of 36 cos θ + 6 h sin θ is achieved when cos θ = 36 / sqrt(36^2 + (6 h)^2), and sin θ = (6 h) / sqrt(36^2 + (6 h)^2).

Wait, more accurately, the maximum of A cos θ + B sin θ is sqrt(A^2 + B^2). So in this case, A = 36, B = 6 h.

So the maximum of 36 cos θ + 6 h sin θ is sqrt(36^2 + (6 h)^2) = sqrt(1296 + 36 h^2).

Hence, D_max = 45 + h^2 + sqrt(1296 + 36 h^2).

Similarly, D_min = 45 + h^2 - sqrt(1296 + 36 h^2).

So when h^2 = 28:

D_max = 45 + 28 + sqrt(1296 + 36*28) = 73 + sqrt(1296 + 1008) = 73 + sqrt(2304) = 73 + 48 = 121. Which checks out.

Similarly, when h^2 = 160:

D_min = 45 + 160 - sqrt(1296 + 36*160) = 205 - sqrt(1296 + 5760) = 205 - sqrt(7056) = 205 - 84 = 121. Correct.

So, the point of maximum distance is when 36 cos θ + 6 h sin θ is maximized. So the direction of θ and φ at this point would determine the location on the sphere.

But perhaps it's easier to find the z-coordinate at the point of tangency.

Wait, from the parametrization, z = h + 3 sin θ.

At the point of maximum D(θ), the point on the torus is where cos θ = 1, because that maximizes the term 36 cos θ. Wait, but the maximum of 36 cos θ + 6 h sin θ occurs when θ is such that:

tan φ = (6 h)/36 = h/6.

Wait, perhaps I can find θ for which 36 cos θ + 6 h sin θ is maximum.

Wait, the maximum occurs when θ is such that:

d/dθ (36 cos θ + 6 h sin θ) = -36 sin θ + 6 h cos θ = 0.

So, -36 sin θ + 6 h cos θ = 0 → 6 h cos θ = 36 sin θ → tan θ = (6 h)/36 = h/6.

So θ = arctan(h/6).

So, at this θ, the point on the torus has coordinates:

x = (6 + 3 cos θ) cos φ
y = (6 + 3 cos θ) sin φ
z = h + 3 sin θ

But I need to find the position of this point on the sphere. Since the point lies on the sphere, x² + y² + z² = 121.

But perhaps instead of going through this, I can find the z-coordinate at the point of tangency.

Alternatively, perhaps I can find the height z where the point of tangency occurs. Since the point lies on both the torus and the sphere, and the distance from the origin is 11, perhaps I can find z and use that to find the radius of the circle of tangency.

Wait, the circle of tangency lies in a plane at a certain z. So the radius of the circle would be sqrt(121 - z^2).

So, I need to find z for internal and external cases.

Wait, from earlier, in the internal case, h = sqrt(28). Also, at the point of maximum distance, the point on the torus is at (x, y, z) where x² + y² + z² = 121.

From the parametrization:

x = (6 + 3 cos θ) cos φ
y = (6 + 3 cos θ) sin φ
z = h + 3 sin θ

We know that x² + y² + z² = 121.

But this seems complicated. Alternatively, perhaps I can find z in terms of h and θ.

Wait, from the parametrization, z = h + 3 sin θ.

At the point of maximum distance, which occurs when 36 cos θ + 6 h sin θ is maximized, we have:

tan θ = h / 6.

So, sin θ = h / sqrt(h^2 + 36), cos θ = 6 / sqrt(h^2 + 36).

So, z = h + 3 * (h / sqrt(h^2 + 36)) = h + (3 h) / sqrt(h^2 + 36).

Similarly, x = (6 + 3 cos θ) cos φ, y = (6 + 3 cos θ) sin φ.

But perhaps I can find the value of z for each case.

Case 1: Internal tangency, h = sqrt(28).

So h = sqrt(28), so h^2 = 28.

Compute sin θ and cos θ:

sin θ = h / sqrt(h^2 + 36) = sqrt(28) / sqrt(28 + 36) = sqrt(28)/sqrt(64) = sqrt(28)/8 = (2 sqrt(7))/8 = sqrt(7)/4.

cos θ = 6 / sqrt(28 + 36) = 6/8 = 3/4.

So, z = sqrt(28) + 3*(sqrt(7)/4) = sqrt(28) + (3 sqrt(7))/4.

But sqrt(28) is 2 sqrt(7), so:

z = 2 sqrt(7) + (3 sqrt(7))/4 = (8 sqrt(7) + 3 sqrt(7))/4 = (11 sqrt(7))/4.

So the z-coordinate at the point of tangency for internal case is (11 sqrt(7))/4.

Thus, the radius of the circle of tangency on the sphere is sqrt(11^2 - z^2).

So, r_i = sqrt(121 - ( (11 sqrt(7))/4 )^2 )

Compute (11 sqrt(7)/4)^2 = (121 * 7) / 16 = 847 / 16.

So, r_i = sqrt(121 - 847/16) = sqrt( (1936/16) - (847/16) ) = sqrt(1089/16) = 33/4.

Similarly, for external tangency, h = sqrt(160) = 4 sqrt(10).

So h = 4 sqrt(10).

Compute sin θ and cos θ:

sin θ = h / sqrt(h^2 + 36) = 4 sqrt(10) / sqrt(160 + 36) = 4 sqrt(10)/sqrt(196) = 4 sqrt(10)/14 = (2 sqrt(10))/7.

cos θ = 6 / sqrt(160 + 36) = 6/14 = 3/7.

So, z = h + 3 sin θ = 4 sqrt(10) + 3*(2 sqrt(10)/7) = 4 sqrt(10) + (6 sqrt(10))/7 = (28 sqrt(10) + 6 sqrt(10))/7 = (34 sqrt(10))/7.

Wait, but wait, h = sqrt(160) = 4 sqrt(10), correct.

So, z = 4 sqrt(10) + 3*(2 sqrt(10)/7) = 4 sqrt(10) + (6 sqrt(10)/7) = (28 sqrt(10) + 6 sqrt(10))/7 = 34 sqrt(10)/7.

So the radius of the circle of tangency is sqrt(121 - z^2).

Compute z^2 = (34 sqrt(10)/7)^2 = (34^2 * 10) / 49 = (1156 * 10)/49 = 11560 / 49.

So, r_o = sqrt(121 - 11560/49) = sqrt( (121 * 49) - 11560 ) / 7.

Compute 121*49: 121*50=6050, minus 121=6050-121=5929.

So, 5929 - 11560 = -5631. That can't be right because we can't have a negative inside the sqrt.

Wait, this indicates a mistake. Because for external tangency, the point of tangency should be on the opposite side, perhaps with a negative z-coordinate.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the sign of z. Let me check.

In the external tangency case, the center is at h = sqrt(160), which is positive. So the point of tangency at maximum distance would have the maximum z, but perhaps the point lies below the origin.

Wait, no, when the torus is externally tangent, the center is at h = sqrt(160) ≈ 12.649, which is outside the sphere of radius 11, so the point of tangency would be in the opposite direction, perhaps with z negative.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the direction. Let me recompute.

Wait, in the external case, the minimum distance is 11. So perhaps the point of tangency is at the lowest point on the torus, which would be along the negative z-axis.

Wait, from the parametrization, z = h + 3 sin θ.

To minimize the distance from the origin, perhaps we need to minimize D(θ), which occurs when 36 cos θ + 6 h sin θ is minimized. The minimum of A cos θ + B sin θ is -sqrt(A^2 + B^2).

So, D_min = 45 + h² - sqrt(1296 + 36 h^2).

Which we set to 121.

So, for h = sqrt(160), let's compute z.

Wait, from earlier, the point of tangency occurs when θ is such that tan θ = h / 6.

Wait, wait, no. Earlier, for maximum D(θ), tan θ = h /6.

But for minimum D(θ), perhaps tan θ = -h /6, leading to sin θ negative.

So, perhaps in the external case, z = h + 3 sin θ, and sin θ would be negative, leading to a negative z.

So, let me compute sin θ and cos θ for the external case.

h = sqrt(160) = 4 sqrt(10).

At the point of minimum D(θ), the term 36 cos θ + 6 h sin θ is minimized, which is when 36 cos θ + 6 h sin θ = -sqrt(36^2 + (6 h)^2) = -sqrt(1296 + 36 h^2).

So, the condition for minimum D(θ) is:

36 cos θ + 6 h sin θ = -sqrt(1296 + 36 h^2)

Which implies:

cos θ = (-36) / sqrt(36^2 + (6 h)^2)
sin θ = (-6 h) / sqrt(36^2 + (6 h)^2)

So, for h = sqrt(160):

Compute sqrt(36^2 + (6*sqrt(160))^2) = sqrt(1296 + 36*160) = sqrt(1296 + 5760) = sqrt(7056) = 84.

So, cos θ = (-36)/84 = -3/7.

sin θ = (-6*sqrt(160))/84 = (-6*4 sqrt(10))/84 = (-24 sqrt(10))/84 = (-2 sqrt(10))/7.

So, z = h + 3 sin θ = sqrt(160) + 3*(-2 sqrt(10)/7) = 4 sqrt(10) - (6 sqrt(10))/7.

Compute 4 sqrt(10) as 28 sqrt(10)/7, so:

z = (28 sqrt(10) - 6 sqrt(10))/7 = (22 sqrt(10))/7.

Wait, but that's still positive. Hmm, perhaps I'm missing something here.

Wait, 4 sqrt(10) is about 12.649, and 6 sqrt(10)/7 is about 2.54. So 12.649 - 2.54 ≈ 10.109, which is less than 11, but the point is supposed to be on the sphere of radius 11. So that makes sense.

Wait, but the radius of the circle of tangency would be sqrt(121 - z^2).

Compute z^2 = (22 sqrt(10)/7)^2 = (484 * 10)/49 = 4840/49.

So, r_o = sqrt(121 - 4840/49) = sqrt( (121*49) - 4840 ) / 7.

121*49 = 5929.

5929 - 4840 = 1089.

So sqrt(1089/49) = 33/7.

So r_i = 33/4 and r_o = 33/7.

Thus, the difference r_i - r_o = 33/4 - 33/7 = (33*7 - 33*4)/(4*7) = (231 - 132)/28 = 99/28.

Simplify 99/28: 99 and 28 are coprime? 99 factors into 9*11, 28 is 4*7. No common factors, so m=99, n=28. Thus, m + n = 127.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The problem involves finding the difference between the radii of the circles where a torus is internally and externally tangent to a sphere. 

1. **Torus and Sphere Parameters**:
   - Torus (T) with major radius \( R = 6 \) and minor radius \( r = 3 \).
   - Sphere (S) with radius \( 11 \).

2. **Distance from Origin to Torus**:
   - The distance squared from the origin to a point on the torus is given by:
     \[
     D(\theta) = 45 + h^2 + 36 \cos \theta + 6h \sin \theta
     \]
   - For internal tangency, the maximum distance is \( 11 \), leading to \( h = \sqrt{28} \).
   - For external tangency, the minimum distance is \( 11 \), leading to \( h = \sqrt{160} \).

3. **Radius of Tangency Circles**:
   - **Internal Case**:
     - \( h = \sqrt{28} \), \( z = \frac{11\sqrt{7}}{4} \).
     - Radius \( r_i = \sqrt{121 - \left(\frac{11\sqrt{7}}{4}\right)^2} = \frac{33}{4} \).
   - **External Case**:
     - \( h = \sqrt{160} \), \( z = \frac{22\sqrt{10}}{7} \).
     - Radius \( r_o = \sqrt{121 - \left(\frac{22\sqrt{10}}{7}\right)^2} = \frac{33}{7} \).

4. **Difference in Radii**:
   - \( r_i - r_o = \frac{33}{4} - \frac{33}{7} = \frac{99}{28} \).
   - \( m = 99 \), \( n = 28 \), so \( m + n = 127 \).

The final answer is \(\boxed{127}\).
