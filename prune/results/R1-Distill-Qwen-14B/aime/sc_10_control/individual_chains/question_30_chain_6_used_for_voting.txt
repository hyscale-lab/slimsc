Okay, so I've got this math problem here, and I need to find the remainder when the product from k=0 to 12 of (2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k}) is divided by 1000. ω is a 13th root of unity, and it's not equal to 1. Hmm, that seems a bit complicated, but let's break it down.

First, I remember that roots of unity are solutions to the equation x^n = 1, where n is the order. In this case, ω is a primitive 13th root of unity because ω ≠ 1. That means ω^13 = 1, and no smaller positive integer exponent will give 1.

The product is over k from 0 to 12, so that's all the 13th roots of unity, right? Wait, but when k=0, ω^0 is 1, so that term is (2 - 2*1 + 1^2) = 2 - 2 + 1 = 1. So the first term in the product is 1. That won't affect the product, so maybe I can start from k=1 instead? Hmm, but the problem says k=0 to 12, so I have to include that.

So the entire product is the product over all 13th roots of unity of (2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k}). That looks a bit messy, but maybe I can find a way to simplify it.

I remember that for cyclotomic polynomials, the product over (x - ω^k) for k from 0 to n-1 is x^n - 1. But here, the terms are not just x - ω^k; they're more complicated. So perhaps I can manipulate the expression inside the product to relate to something I know.

Looking at the term inside the product: 2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k}. Let me write it as 2 - 2ω^k + (ω^k)^2. That looks quadratic in terms of ω^k. So maybe I can factor it or write it as a quadratic equation.

Let me denote z = ω^k. Then the expression becomes 2 - 2z + z². So that's z² - 2z + 2. Hmm, that's a quadratic in z. Maybe I can factor it or find its roots?

Let me compute the discriminant: D = (-2)^2 - 4*1*2 = 4 - 8 = -4. The roots would be [2 ± sqrt(-4)] / 2 = [2 ± 2i]/2 = 1 ± i. So the quadratic factors as (z - (1 + i))(z - (1 - i)). 

So, the expression 2 - 2z + z² is equal to (z - (1 + i))(z - (1 - i)). So substituting back z = ω^k, we have:

2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k} = (ω^k - (1 + i))(ω^k - (1 - i)).

So the original product becomes the product from k=0 to 12 of (ω^k - (1 + i))(ω^k - (1 - i)).

Which can be written as the product from k=0 to 12 of (ω^k - (1 + i)) multiplied by the product from k=0 to 12 of (ω^k - (1 - i)).

So, the entire product is [product_{k=0}^{12} (ω^k - (1 + i))] * [product_{k=0}^{12} (ω^k - (1 - i))].

Now, I remember that for cyclotomic polynomials, the product over (x - ω^k) is x^13 - 1, since ω is a primitive 13th root. But here, the product is (ω^k - a), where a is a constant. Hmm, maybe if I can relate it to evaluating a polynomial at a specific value.

Let me think: The product over (x - ω^k) for k=0 to 12 is x^13 - 1. So if I set x = (1 + i), then the product becomes (1 + i)^13 - 1. Similarly, for x = (1 - i), the product is (1 - i)^13 - 1.

Wait, but in our case, the product is over (ω^k - a), which is the same as (-1)^13 times (a - ω^k) for each term. Since there are 13 terms, (-1)^13 = -1. So the product over (ω^k - a) is (-1)^13 * product over (a - ω^k) = - product over (a - ω^k) = -(a^13 - 1). 

Wait, let me make sure. Let me write it down:

product_{k=0}^{12} (ω^k - a) = product_{k=0}^{12} (-1)(a - ω^k) ) = (-1)^{13} product_{k=0}^{12} (a - ω^k) = (-1)^{13} (a^{13} - 1) = - (a^{13} - 1) = 1 - a^{13}.

Ah, right. Because product_{k=0}^{12} (x - ω^k) = x^13 - 1, so product_{k=0}^{12} (a - ω^k) = a^13 - 1. Then product (ω^k - a) = (-1)^13 product (a - ω^k) = - (a^13 - 1) = 1 - a^13.

So, coming back, for a = 1 + i, the product becomes 1 - (1 + i)^13. Similarly, for a = 1 - i, it's 1 - (1 - i)^13.

So, the total product we're looking at is [1 - (1 + i)^13] * [1 - (1 - i)^13].

So now, I need to compute (1 + i)^13 and (1 - i)^13.

I remember that 1 + i can be written in polar form. Let's compute its magnitude and angle.

The magnitude |1 + i| is sqrt(1^2 + 1^2) = sqrt(2). The angle (argument) is 45 degrees, or π/4 radians.

Similarly, 1 - i has the same magnitude, sqrt(2), but the angle is -π/4.

So, (1 + i)^13 = [sqrt(2)]^13 * e^{i * 13 * π/4}.

Similarly, (1 - i)^13 = [sqrt(2)]^13 * e^{-i * 13 * π/4}.

Let me compute [sqrt(2)]^13. Since sqrt(2) is 2^(1/2), so [2^(1/2)]^13 = 2^(13/2) = 2^6 * 2^(1/2) = 64 * sqrt(2).

Now, for the angles:

13 * π/4. Let's compute this modulo 2π to find the equivalent angle between 0 and 2π.

13 divided by 8 is 1 with a remainder of 5, because 8 * 1 = 8, 13 - 8 = 5. So 13 * π/4 = 3π + π/4. Wait, let's compute it properly:

13 * π/4 = (12 + 1) * π/4 = 3π + π/4 = 3π + π/4.

But 3π is more than 2π, so subtracting 2π gives 3π + π/4 - 2π = π + π/4 = 5π/4.

Similarly, for the negative angle:

-13 * π/4 = - (13 * π/4). Let's compute this modulo 2π.

13 divided by 4 is 3 with a remainder of 1, so 13 * π/4 = 3π + π/4. So, negative of that is -3π - π/4. But to make it positive, add 4π (which is 2 full rotations):

-3π - π/4 + 4π = π - π/4 = 3π/4.

Wait, let me check that again. Another way: adding multiples of 2π until the angle is positive.

-13π/4 + 2π = (-13π/4 + 8π/4) = (-5π/4). Still negative. Add another 2π:

-5π/4 + 8π/4 = 3π/4. Okay, so -13π/4 is equivalent to 3π/4 modulo 2π.

So, (1 + i)^13 = [sqrt(2)]^13 * e^{i * 5π/4} = 64 sqrt(2) [ cos(5π/4) + i sin(5π/4) ].

Similarly, (1 - i)^13 = [sqrt(2)]^13 * e^{-i * 13π/4} = 64 sqrt(2) [ cos(3π/4) + i sin(3π/4) ].

Let me compute the trigonometric parts:

cos(5π/4) = -sqrt(2)/2, sin(5π/4) = -sqrt(2)/2.

cos(3π/4) = -sqrt(2)/2, sin(3π/4) = sqrt(2)/2.

So, (1 + i)^13 = 64 sqrt(2) [ (-sqrt(2)/2) + i (-sqrt(2)/2) ].

Let me compute that step by step:

First, 64 sqrt(2) multiplied by (-sqrt(2)/2) is 64 * sqrt(2) * (-sqrt(2)/2) = 64 * ( (-2)/2 ) = 64 * (-1) = -64.

Similarly, the imaginary part is 64 sqrt(2) * (-sqrt(2)/2) = -64.

So, (1 + i)^13 = -64 - 64i.

Wait, let me double-check that:

sqrt(2) * sqrt(2) is 2. So 64 sqrt(2) * sqrt(2) is 64 * 2 = 128. But we have (-sqrt(2)/2), so 64 sqrt(2) * (-sqrt(2)/2) = 64 * (2) * (-1/2) )= 64 * (-1) = -64. Yep, that's right.

So, (1 + i)^13 = (-64) + (-64)i.

Similarly, (1 - i)^13 = 64 sqrt(2) [ (-sqrt(2)/2) + i (sqrt(2)/2) ].

Calculating the real part: 64 sqrt(2) * (-sqrt(2)/2) = -64.

Imaginary part: 64 sqrt(2) * (sqrt(2)/2) = 64 * (2)/2 = 64.

So, (1 - i)^13 = -64 + 64i.

Now, let me plug these back into the products:

1 - (1 + i)^13 = 1 - (-64 -64i) = 1 + 64 + 64i = 65 + 64i.

Similarly, 1 - (1 - i)^13 = 1 - (-64 + 64i) = 1 + 64 - 64i = 65 - 64i.

So, the total product is (65 + 64i)(65 - 64i). That's the product of a complex number and its conjugate, which is the square of the modulus.

So, (65 + 64i)(65 - 64i) = 65² + (64)^2.

Compute 65²: 65 * 65. Let's compute that: 60² = 3600, 60*5=300, 5²=25. So 65² = (60 + 5)^2 = 60² + 2*60*5 +5² = 3600 + 600 +25= 4225.

64² is 4096. So the sum is 4225 + 4096 = 8321.

So the total product is 8321.

Wait, but the problem says to find the remainder when this product is divided by 1000. So 8321 divided by 1000. The remainder is the last three digits, which is 321. So the remainder is 321.

Wait, let me confirm that:

8321 divided by 1000 is 8 with a remainder of 321, because 8*1000=8000, and 8321-8000=321.

So the answer should be 321.

Wait, but before I get too confident, let me check my steps again. Did I make any mistakes?

Starting from the product: It was broken down into two products, each over (ω^k - a) where a was 1+i and 1-i. Then, I used the fact that product_{k=0}^{12} (x - ω^k) = x^13 -1, so product (ω^k - a) = 1 - a^13. Then, I computed a^13 for a=1+i and a=1-i.

Converted 1+i to polar form: sqrt(2) e^{iπ/4}, so (1+i)^13 is [sqrt(2)]^13 e^{i13π/4} which simplified to 64 sqrt(2) e^{i5π/4}, which is (-64 -64i). Similarly for (1-i)^13, which became (-64 +64i). Then, 1 - (these terms) gave 65 +64i and 65 -64i. Their product was 65² +64²=4225 +4096=8321. Mod 1000 is 321.

Hmm, seems solid. I think that's correct.

Alright, let's go through the solution step by step.

1. **Understanding the Problem**:
   We need to find the remainder when the product \(\prod_{k=0}^{12}(2 - 2\omega^k + \omega^{2k})\) is divided by 1000, where \(\omega\) is a primitive 13th root of unity (\(\omega \neq 1\)).

2. **Simplifying the Product**:
   Let \(z = \omega^k\). The term inside the product becomes \(2 - 2z + z^2\), which factors as \((z - (1 + i))(z - (1 - i))\).

3. **Expressing the Product**:
   The product can be rewritten as:
   \[
   \prod_{k=0}^{12} (2 - 2\omega^k + \omega^{2k}) = \left( \prod_{k=0}^{12} (\omega^k - (1 + i)) \right) \left( \prod_{k=0}^{12} (\omega^k - (1 - i)) \right)
   \]

4. **Using Cyclotomic Polynomials**:
   For a primitive 13th root of unity \(\omega\), the product \(\prod_{k=0}^{12} (x - \omega^k) = x^{13} - 1\). Substituting \(x = 1 + i\) and \(x = 1 - i\), we get:
   \[
   \prod_{k=0}^{12} (\omega^k - (1 + i)) = 1 - (1 + i)^{13}, \quad \prod_{k=0}^{12} (\omega^k - (1 - i)) = 1 - (1 - i)^{13}
   \]

5. **Calculating \((1 + i)^{13}\) and \((1 - i)^{13}\)**:
   - \(1 + i = \sqrt{2}e^{i\pi/4}\), so \((1 + i)^{13} = (2^{1/2})^{13}e^{i13\pi/4} = 64\sqrt{2}e^{i5\pi/4} = -64 - 64i\)
   - \(1 - i = \sqrt{2}e^{-i\pi/4}\), so \((1 - i)^{13} = 64\sqrt{2}e^{-i13\pi/4} = -64 + 64i\)

6. **Evaluating the Products**:
   - \(1 - (1 + i)^{13} = 1 - (-64 - 64i) = 65 + 64i\)
   - \(1 - (1 - i)^{13} = 1 - (-64 + 64i) = 65 - 64i\)

7. **Multiplying the Results**:
   \[
   (65 + 64i)(65 - 64i) = 65^2 + 64^2 = 4225 + 4096 = 8321
   \]

8. **Finding the Remainder**:
   The remainder when 8321 is divided by 1000 is \(8321 \mod 1000 = 321\).

**Final Answer**: \(\boxed{321}\)
