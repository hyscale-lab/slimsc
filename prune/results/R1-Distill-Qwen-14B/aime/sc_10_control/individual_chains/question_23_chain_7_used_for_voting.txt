Okay, so I've got this math problem here about a hyperbola and a rhombus. Let me try to unpack it step by step. 

First, the hyperbola is given by the equation x²/20 - y²/24 = 1. So, that's a standard hyperbola centered at the origin, opening to the left and right along the x-axis. The transverse axis is along the x-axis because the positive term is with x². 

Now, the problem mentions points A, B, C, D on this hyperbola, and these points form a rhombus ABCD. The diagonals of this rhombus intersect at the origin. So, the diagonals are AC and BD, and they cross each other at the origin, which is the center of the hyperbola. 

Since it's a rhombus, I remember that the diagonals are perpendicular bisectors of each other. So, the origin is the midpoint of both diagonals. That means if point A is (x, y), then point C, which is opposite to A, should be (-x, -y). Similarly, points B and D will be such that B is (x', y') and D is (-x', -y'). 

All four points lie on the hyperbola, so each must satisfy the equation x²/20 - y²/24 = 1. So, for point A: (x)²/20 - (y)²/24 = 1, and similarly for point B: (x')²/20 - (y')²/24 = 1.

Since ABCD is a rhombus, all sides are equal in length. So, the distance between A and B should be equal to the distance between B and C, and so on. But maybe there's a better way to approach this with the properties of the rhombus and the hyperbola.

I recall that in a rhombus, the diagonals are perpendicular. So, the product of their slopes should be -1. Let's think about the diagonals AC and BD. 

Diagonal AC goes from (x, y) to (-x, -y), so its midpoint is the origin. Similarly, BD goes from (x', y') to (-x', -y'). The slope of AC would be (y - (-y))/(x - (-x)) = (2y)/(2x) = y/x. Similarly, the slope of BD is (y' - (-y'))/(x' - (-x')) = (2y')/(2x') = y'/x'. 

Since the diagonals are perpendicular, their slopes multiply to -1. So, (y/x) * (y'/x') = -1. Which implies that (y * y') / (x * x') = -1. So, y * y' = -x * x'. That's one equation we have.

Also, since ABCD is a rhombus, the vectors AB and AD should have the same magnitude. Let me think about the coordinates. Point A is (x, y), B is (x', y'), and D is (-x', -y'). So, vector AB is (x' - x, y' - y), and vector AD is (-x' - x, -y' - y). 

The lengths of AB and AD must be equal. So, the magnitude squared of AB equals the magnitude squared of AD. So:

( (x' - x)² + (y' - y)² ) = ( (-x' - x)² + (-y' - y)² )

Let me expand both sides:

Left side: (x'² - 2x'x + x²) + (y'² - 2y'y + y²)
Right side: (x'² + 2x'x + x²) + (y'² + 2y'y + y²)

Subtract left side from right side:

[ (x'² + 2x'x + x²) + (y'² + 2y'y + y²) ) ] - [ (x'² - 2x'x + x²) + (y'² - 2y'y + y²) ) ] = 0

Simplify term by term:

x'² cancels, 2x'x - (-2x'x) = 4x'x

Similarly, x² cancels, y'² cancels, 2y'y - (-2y'y) = 4y'y

So, 4x'x + 4y'y = 0

Divide both sides by 4: x'x + y'y = 0

Hmm, so we have another equation: x'x + y'y = 0.

Previously, we had y y' = -x x'. So, let's note both equations:

1) y y' = -x x'
2) x x' + y y' = 0

Wait, substituting equation 1 into equation 2: equation 2 becomes x x' + (-x x') = 0, which is x x' - x x' = 0, which is 0 = 0. So, this doesn't give us new information. Hmm, that suggests that maybe the condition of equal sides is automatically satisfied given that the diagonals are perpendicular and the origin is the midpoint. Maybe I need another approach.

Alternatively, since all four points lie on the hyperbola, maybe we can parameterize points A and B on the hyperbola, then use the rhombus properties to find relationships between their coordinates.

Another thought: for a hyperbola x²/a² - y²/b² =1, the parametrization can be done using hyperbolic functions. So, points on the hyperbola can be represented as (a secθ, b tanθ) or (a cosh t, b sinh t). Maybe using hyperbola parametrization could simplify things.

Let me try using parametric coordinates for A and B. Let's say point A is (sqrt(20) secθ, sqrt(24) tanθ), and point B is (sqrt(20) secφ, sqrt(24) tanφ). Then, points C and D would be (-sqrt(20) secθ, -sqrt(24) tanθ) and (-sqrt(20) secφ, -sqrt(24) tanφ), respectively.

But since ABCD is a rhombus with diagonals intersecting at the origin, the sides should satisfy certain conditions. Alternatively, maybe it's better to use vectors.

Let me denote vectors OA and OB as vectors from the origin to points A and B. Since the diagonals bisect each other at the origin, the midpoint of AC is the origin, which implies that vector OA + vector OC = 0. Similarly, vector OB + vector OD = 0. So, points C and D are just the negatives of A and B.

In a rhombus, the diagonals are perpendicular. So, vectors AC and BD are perpendicular. But AC is from A to C, which is (-2x, -2y), and BD is from B to D, which is (-2x', -2y'). Wait, but AC is the diagonal, and BD is the other diagonal. So, the vectors representing the diagonals would be AC = C - A = (-2x, -2y) and BD = D - B = (-2x', -2y').

Wait, but the diagonals are AC and BD, so vectors AC and BD should be perpendicular. So, their dot product should be zero. So:

AC · BD = (-2x)(-2x') + (-2y)(-2y') = 4x x' + 4y y' = 0

Divide both sides by 4: x x' + y y' = 0.

Which is the same equation as before. So, that's consistent.

Now, let's see if we can express BD² in terms of x, y, x', y'. BD is the diagonal from B to D, which has length sqrt[ (x' - (-x'))² + (y' - (-y'))² ] = sqrt[ (2x')² + (2y')² ] = 2 sqrt( x'² + y'² ). So, BD² is [2 sqrt(x'² + y'²)]² = 4(x'² + y'²).

Similarly, AC² would be 4(x² + y²).

But since all four points are on the hyperbola, we have x²/20 - y²/24 =1, and x'²/20 - y'²/24 =1.

Hmm, so x² = 20(1 + y²/24 ) = 20 + (5/6)y².

Similarly, x'² = 20 + (5/6) y'².

So, BD² = 4(x'² + y'²) = 4[20 + (5/6)y'² + y'²] = 4[20 + (11/6)y'²] = 80 + (22/3)y'².

But since the points are on the hyperbola, y' can vary. Wait, but we also have the condition x x' + y y' = 0 from the perpendicular diagonals.

So, x x' + y y' = 0.

Let me express x in terms of y from the hyperbola equation:

From x²/20 - y²/24 =1, x² = 20(1 + y²/24).

So, x = sqrt[20(1 + y²/24)] or x = -sqrt[20(1 + y²/24)].

Similarly, x' = sqrt[20(1 + y'^2 /24)] or negative.

But in the equation x x' + y y' = 0, suppose x and x' have opposite signs because their product is negative (assuming y and y' are positive; but maybe not necessarily). Let me think: x x' = - y y'.

So, if y and y' are positive, then x and x' have opposite signs.

But perhaps it's better to square both sides to eliminate the square roots.

So, from x x' + y y' = 0, we have x x' = - y y'.

Square both sides: (x x')² = (y y')².

So, x² x'² = y² y'².

But from the hyperbola equation, x² = 20(1 + y²/24) and x'² = 20(1 + y'^2 /24). Substitute these into the equation:

[20(1 + y²/24)] [20(1 + y'^2 /24)] = y² y'².

Let me compute the left side:

20 * 20 * (1 + y²/24)(1 + y'^2 /24) = 400 (1 + y²/24 + y'^2 /24 + y² y'^2 / (24*24)).

So, 400 [1 + (y² + y'^2)/24 + (y y')² / 576 ].

Set equal to y² y'²:

400 [1 + (y² + y'^2)/24 + (y y')² / 576 ] = y² y'².

Hmm, this seems complicated, but maybe we can make a substitution. Let me let u = y² and v = y'^2. Then, the equation becomes:

400 [1 + (u + v)/24 + (uv)/576 ] = uv.

Let me compute each term:

First term: 400 *1 = 400.

Second term: 400*(u + v)/24 = (400/24)(u + v) = (50/3)(u + v).

Third term: 400*(uv)/576 = (400/576)uv = (25/36)uv.

So, the equation becomes:

400 + (50/3)(u + v) + (25/36)uv = uv.

Bring all terms to one side:

400 + (50/3)(u + v) + (25/36)uv - uv = 0.

Simplify the uv terms:

(25/36)uv - uv = (25/36 - 36/36)uv = (-11/36)uv.

So, the equation is:

400 + (50/3)(u + v) - (11/36)uv = 0.

Multiply both sides by 36 to eliminate denominators:

36*400 + 36*(50/3)(u + v) - 11 uv = 0.

Compute each term:

36*400 = 14400.

36*(50/3) = 6*50 = 300.

So, equation becomes:

14400 + 300(u + v) - 11 uv = 0.

Rearranged:

-11 uv + 300 u + 300 v + 14400 = 0.

Multiply both sides by -1 to make the coefficients positive:

11 uv - 300 u - 300 v - 14400 = 0.

Hmm, this is a quadratic in two variables. Maybe we can write it as:

11 uv - 300 u - 300 v = 14400.

Perhaps factor by grouping. Let me see:

11 uv - 300 u - 300 v = 14400.

Let me factor:

u(11 v - 300) - 300 v = 14400.

Hmm, not sure. Alternatively, maybe add 90000/(11) to both sides to complete the rectangle, but that might be messy.

Alternatively, let me denote s = u + v and p = uv. Then, the equation becomes:

11p - 300 s = 14400.

Wait, but without another equation, it might be hard to solve for s and p. Alternatively, perhaps use substitution.

Alternatively, maybe express v in terms of u from the equation.

From 11 uv - 300 u - 300 v = 14400.

Let's rearrange:

11 uv - 300 u - 300 v = 14400.

Let me factor:

v(11 u - 300) - 300 u = 14400.

Hmm, so v = (14400 + 300 u)/(11 u - 300).

But since u and v are squares of real numbers (y² and y'^2), they must be non-negative. So, the numerator and denominator must have the same sign.

So, (14400 + 300 u) and (11 u - 300) must be both positive or both negative.

Case 1: Both positive.

So, 11 u - 300 > 0 => u > 300/11 ≈ 27.27.

And 14400 + 300 u > 0, which is always true since u ≥ 0.

Case 2: Both negative.

11 u - 300 < 0 => u < 300/11 ≈ 27.27.

And 14400 + 300 u < 0. But 14400 is positive, and 300 u is non-negative since u ≥ 0. So, 14400 + 300 u is always ≥ 14400, which cannot be negative. So, Case 2 is impossible.

Therefore, only Case 1 is valid: u > 300/11.

So, v = (14400 + 300 u)/(11 u - 300).

We can also note that v must be ≥ 0 as it's y'^2.

Now, since v is expressed in terms of u, we can express BD² in terms of u.

Earlier, we had BD² = 80 + (22/3) v.

So, BD² = 80 + (22/3) * [ (14400 + 300 u)/(11 u - 300) ].

Simplify that expression.

Let me compute:

(22/3) * (14400 + 300 u)/(11 u - 300) = (22/3) * 300 (48 + u) / (11 u - 300).

Wait, 14400 = 300 * 48, right? 300 * 48 = 14,400.

So, 14400 + 300 u = 300 (48 + u).

So, substituting:

(22/3) * [300 (48 + u) / (11 u - 300) ].

Simplify:

(22/3) * 300 = 22 * 100 = 2200.

So, BD² = 80 + 2200*(48 + u)/(11 u - 300).

Now, let me simplify the fraction (48 + u)/(11 u - 300).

Let me write 48 + u as u + 48.

And denominator as 11u - 300.

Hmm, perhaps express numerator and denominator in terms of u.

Alternatively, let's let t = u, so that we have BD² expressed as:

BD² = 80 + 2200*(t + 48)/(11 t - 300).

We need to find the minimum possible BD², because the problem asks for the greatest real number less than BD² for all such rhombi. So, the infimum of BD².

Wait, no, wait. The question is to find the greatest real number that is less than BD² for all such rhombi. So, we need the supremum (least upper bound) of the lower bounds, but since BD² can vary, we need the infimum of BD², and then the answer is the greatest number less than BD² for all rhombi, which would be the infimum of BD².

Wait, maybe I should think again.

Wait, if BD² can take a minimum value, then the greatest number less than BD² for all rhombi would be that minimum value. Because if BD² can get as low as some number, then any number less than that would not be a lower bound for all rhombi. Therefore, the greatest number less than BD² for all rhombi is the infimum (greatest lower bound) of BD². So, we need to find the minimal possible BD².

So, our goal is to minimize BD², which is expressed as 80 + 2200*(t + 48)/(11 t - 300), where t = u > 300/11.

So, let me write BD² as:

BD² = 80 + 2200*(t + 48)/(11t - 300).

Let me simplify this expression.

First, factor numerator and denominator:

t + 48 = t + 48

11 t -300 = 11 t -300

Hmm, perhaps perform polynomial division or see if the fraction can be simplified.

Let me see:

Divide (t + 48) by (11t - 300):

Express as (t + 48) = (1/11)(11t - 300) + (48 + 300/11).

Compute 300/11 ≈27.27, so 48 + 27.27 ≈75.27.

So, t + 48 = (1/11)(11 t -300) + (48 + 300/11).

But 48 + 300/11 = (528 + 300)/11 = 828/11.

So, (t + 48)/(11 t - 300) = [ (1/11)(11 t -300) + 828/11 ] / (11 t -300) = (1/11) + (828/11)/(11 t -300).

So,

BD² = 80 + 2200*(1/11 + (828/11)/(11 t - 300)).

Compute each term:

2200*(1/11) = 200.

2200*(828/11)/(11 t - 300) = 200*(828)/(11 t -300) = (200 * 828)/(11 t -300).

Compute 200 *828: 200*800=160000, 200*28=5600, so total 165600.

So, BD² = 80 + 200 + (165600)/(11 t -300) = 280 + (165600)/(11 t -300).

So, BD² = 280 + 165600/(11 t - 300).

Now, since t > 300/11 ≈27.27, 11 t -300 >0.

So, denominator is positive, and as t increases, 11t -300 increases, so the fraction decreases.

Therefore, BD² is a function of t, where t > 300/11.

We can write BD²(t) = 280 + 165600/(11t - 300).

To find the minimum of BD²(t), since the function 165600/(11t -300) is positive and decreasing as t increases, the minimal BD² occurs when 165600/(11t -300) is minimized.

Wait, no. Wait, 165600/(11t -300) is positive and decreasing as t increases. So, as t approaches (300/11)+, the denominator approaches 0 from the positive side, making the fraction approach infinity. As t increases, the fraction decreases towards 0. So, BD²(t) approaches 280 + 0 = 280 as t approaches infinity. So, the minimal value of BD² is 280, but wait, can BD² approach 280? Because as t increases, BD² approaches 280 from above.

Wait, but does BD² actually attain a minimum value? Or does it just get arbitrarily close to 280?

Wait, let me think. When t approaches infinity, 165600/(11t -300) approaches 0, so BD² approaches 280. But can BD² be equal to 280? Only when t is infinite, which is not possible because t is a real number greater than 300/11. So, BD² can get as close to 280 as we like but never actually reaches 280. Therefore, the infimum of BD² is 280.

But the problem asks for the greatest real number less than BD² for all such rhombi. So, that number would be 280, since BD² can be made arbitrarily close to 280 from above, but never less than 280.

Wait, but let me verify if that's correct. Because as t increases, BD² approaches 280, so BD² can be made as close to 280 as desired. So, the greatest number less than BD² for all rhombi would be 280 because BD² is always greater than 280, but can approach it.

Wait, no. Wait, if BD² approaches 280 from above, that means BD² is always greater than 280. So, 280 is the infimum. So, the greatest number less than BD² for all rhombi is 280, because for any rhombus, BD² is greater than 280, but you can't have a number greater than 280 that is less than all BD².

Wait, but let me confirm. If the infimum is 280, then for any ε>0, there exists a rhombus with BD² < 280 + ε. But the problem asks for the greatest number that is less than BD² for all such rhombi. So, that number must be less than or equal to the infimum. Since the infimum is 280, the greatest number less than BD² for all rhombi is 280, because for any number greater than 280, there exists a rhombus with BD² less than that number. Therefore, 280 is the answer.

Wait, but let me think again. If the infimum is 280, then BD² can be made as close to 280 as we want, but never less than 280. So, 280 is the lower bound, and the problem is asking for the greatest number less than BD² for all rhombi. So, the number must be less than or equal to 280 because BD² can approach 280. So, the greatest such number is 280 itself? Wait, but 280 is not less than BD² for all rhombi, because BD² can be equal to 280 in the limit. So, perhaps the answer is 280, but I might be getting confused here.

Wait, another approach: Let me compute the limit as t approaches infinity of BD²(t). As t approaches infinity, 11t -300 approaches infinity, so 165600/(11t -300) approaches 0, so BD² approaches 280. So, BD² can be made as close to 280 as desired, but never less than 280. Therefore, the infimum is 280, which is the greatest lower bound. So, the greatest real number less than BD² for all rhombi is 280.

Wait, but 280 is the infimum, which is a lower bound. So, any number less than 280 is also a lower bound, but the greatest lower bound is 280. Therefore, the greatest number less than BD² for all rhombi is 280, because if you pick any number greater than 280, there exists a rhombus with BD² less than that number, so you can't have a number greater than 280 that is always less than BD². Hence, 280 is the correct answer.

But wait, let me check my earlier steps for any possible miscalculations. Let me retrace:

We started with the hyperbola equation, expressed x² and x'² in terms of y² and y'². Then, using the condition that diagonals are perpendicular, we arrived at the equation 11 uv -300 u -300 v =14400. Then, we expressed BD² in terms of u and v, and through substitution, expressed BD² as a function of t= u, leading to BD²= 280 + 165600/(11t-300). Then, as t increases, BD² approaches 280 from above. Therefore, the minimal BD² is 280, but it's not attainable. Hence, the infimum is 280, so the greatest number less than BD² for all rhombi is 280.

So, yes, I think 280 is the answer.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To solve the problem, we analyze the hyperbola \( \frac{x^2}{20} - \frac{y^2}{24} = 1 \) and the rhombus \(ABCD\) with diagonals intersecting at the origin. The diagonals of a rhombus are perpendicular bisectors, and since they intersect at the origin, points \(A\) and \(C\) are \((x, y)\) and \((-x, -y)\), while points \(B\) and \(D\) are \((x', y')\) and \((-x', -y')\). 

### Key Steps:
1. **Hyperbola Equation**: Each point on the hyperbola satisfies \( \frac{x^2}{20} - \frac{y^2}{24} = 1 \), leading to \( x^2 = 20(1 + \frac{y^2}{24}) \) and \( x'^2 = 20(1 + \frac{y'^2}{24}) \).

2. **Perpendicular Diagonals**: The slopes of diagonals \(AC\) and \(BD\) must satisfy \( \frac{y}{x} \cdot \frac{y'}{x'} = -1 \), implying \( xy' + yx' = 0 \).

3. **BD² Expression**: The length of diagonal \(BD\) is \(2\sqrt{x'^2 + y'^2}\), so \(BD^2 = 4(x'^2 + y'^2)\). Substituting the hyperbola equation, \(BD^2 = 80 + \frac{22}{3}y'^2\).

4. **Optimization**: Using the condition \(xy' + yx' = 0\) and substituting \(x^2\) and \(x'^2\) from the hyperbola, we derive that \(BD^2\) approaches 280 as \(y'\) increases. Thus, the greatest number less than \(BD^2\) for all such rhombi is 280.

### Final Answer:
\boxed{280}
