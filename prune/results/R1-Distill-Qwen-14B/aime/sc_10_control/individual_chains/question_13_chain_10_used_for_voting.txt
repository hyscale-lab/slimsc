Okay, so I've got this math problem here about Aya's morning walk. Let me read it again to make sure I understand.

Every morning, Aya goes for a 9-kilometer-long walk and stops at a coffee shop afterwards. When she walks at a constant speed of 's' kilometers per hour, the walk takes her 4 hours, including 't' minutes spent in the coffee shop. When she walks at 's + 2' kilometers per hour, the walk takes her 2 hours and 24 minutes, including the same 't' minutes spent in the coffee shop. Now, they want to know how long the walk takes her when she walks at 's + ½' kilometers per hour, including the 't' minutes.

Hmm, okay, so the key here is that the total time she spends is the walking time plus the coffee shop time. But the coffee shop time 't' is the same in both scenarios. So, if I can find out what 't' is and what 's' is, I can then find out the time when she walks at 's + ½' km/h.

Let me break it down. 

First, when she walks at speed 's', the time taken is 4 hours. But this includes the coffee shop time of 't' minutes. So, the actual walking time is 4 hours minus 't' minutes. Similarly, when she walks at 's + 2' km/h, the total time is 2 hours and 24 minutes, which is 2 + 24/60 = 2.4 hours. Again, this includes the same 't' minutes, so the walking time is 2.4 hours minus 't' minutes.

Wait, but time in hours and minutes might complicate things. Maybe I should convert all times to hours or all to minutes to make it consistent.

Let me convert everything to minutes because the coffee shop time is given in minutes.

So, 4 hours is 4 * 60 = 240 minutes. The total time is 240 minutes, which includes the walking time and coffee time. So, walking time is 240 - t minutes.

Similarly, 2 hours and 24 minutes is 2*60 +24= 144 minutes. So, walking time here is 144 - t minutes.

Now, walking time is distance divided by speed. The distance is 9 km in both cases.

So, when she walks at speed 's' km/h, the walking time is (9 / s) hours. But since I converted everything to minutes, maybe I should express that in minutes as well.

Wait, 1 hour is 60 minutes, so (9 / s) hours is (9 / s) * 60 minutes. So, the walking time in minutes is (540 / s) minutes.

Similarly, when she walks at speed 's + 2' km/h, the walking time is (9 / (s + 2)) hours, which is (540 / (s + 2)) minutes.

So, from the first scenario, walking time plus coffee time = 240 minutes.

So:

(540 / s) + t = 240   ...(Equation 1)

From the second scenario:

(540 / (s + 2)) + t = 144   ...(Equation 2)

Now, I can subtract Equation 2 from Equation 1 to eliminate 't'.

So, (540/s - 540/(s+2)) + (t - t) = 240 - 144

Simplify:

540/s - 540/(s + 2) = 96

Factor out 540:

540 [1/s - 1/(s + 2)] = 96

Compute 1/s - 1/(s + 2):

That's (s + 2 - s) / [s(s + 2)] = 2 / [s(s + 2)]

So, 540 * [2 / (s(s + 2))] = 96

Simplify this:

(540 * 2) / [s(s + 2)] = 96

Which is 1080 / [s(s + 2)] = 96

So, 1080 = 96 * s(s + 2)

Divide both sides by 96:

1080 / 96 = s(s + 2)

Simplify 1080 / 96:

Divide numerator and denominator by 24: 1080 ÷24=45, 96 ÷24=4. So, 45/4 = 11.25.

So, s(s + 2) = 11.25

So, s² + 2s - 11.25 = 0

Now, solve this quadratic equation for s.

The quadratic equation is s² + 2s - 11.25 = 0.

Using the quadratic formula:

s = [-2 ± sqrt( (2)^2 - 4*1*(-11.25) ) ] / (2*1)

Compute discriminant:

(2)^2 = 4

4*1*(-11.25) = -45

So, discriminant is 4 - (-45) = 4 +45=49.

So sqrt(49)=7.

Thus,

s = [ -2 ±7 ] / 2

So, two solutions:

s = (-2 +7)/2 = 5/2 = 2.5

s = (-2 -7)/2 = -9/2 = -4.5

But speed cannot be negative, so s = 2.5 km/h.

Wait, hold on. s is 2.5 km/h? That seems a bit slow for a walking speed, but okay, maybe it's correct.

So, s = 2.5 km/h.

Now, let's find 't' from Equation 1.

Equation 1: (540 / s) + t = 240.

Plug s = 2.5:

540 / 2.5 = ?

Well, 540 divided by 2.5. Let me compute:

2.5 * 216 = 540, because 2.5 * 200 = 500, 2.5*16=40, so 200+16=216.

So, 540 /2.5 = 216.

So, 216 + t = 240 => t = 240 - 216 = 24 minutes.

So, t is 24 minutes.

Now, the question is, when she walks at s + ½ km/h, which is 2.5 + 0.5 = 3 km/h, how long does the walk take, including the 24 minutes in the coffee shop.

So, first, compute the walking time at 3 km/h.

Walking time is 9 km / 3 km/h = 3 hours.

But wait, 3 hours is 180 minutes. Then, adding the coffee time, which is 24 minutes.

So, total time is 180 +24 = 204 minutes.

Wait, that's 3 hours and 24 minutes.

But let me confirm. Alternatively, do I compute the time as (9/(s + ½)) hours, then convert that to minutes plus t.

s + ½ is 3 km/h, so 9/3 = 3 hours. 3 hours is 180 minutes. Add t =24 minutes: 204 minutes, which is 3 hours 24 minutes.

So, the answer is 204 minutes.

Wait, but let me check: when s=2.5, t=24. Let's check the second scenario.

At s + 2 = 4.5 km/h.

Walking time is 9/4.5 = 2 hours, which is 120 minutes. Then, add t=24 minutes: 144 minutes, which is 2 hours 24 minutes, as given. So that checks out.

Similarly, at s=2.5 km/h, walking time is 9/2.5 = 3.6 hours = 216 minutes. Add t=24 minutes: 240 minutes, which is 4 hours. So, that also checks out.

Therefore, when she walks at 3 km/h, the walking time is 9/3=3 hours, which is 180 minutes. Including 24 minutes coffee, total is 204 minutes.

So, the answer is 204 minutes.

When Aya walks at a speed of \( s \) km/h, the total time for her walk and coffee stop is 4 hours (240 minutes). The walking time is \( \frac{9}{s} \) hours, which converts to \( \frac{540}{s} \) minutes. Similarly, when she walks at \( s + 2 \) km/h, the total time is 2 hours and 24 minutes (144 minutes), with a walking time of \( \frac{540}{s + 2} \) minutes.

Using the two scenarios, we set up the equations:
\[
\frac{540}{s} + t = 240 \quad \text{(1)}
\]
\[
\frac{540}{s + 2} + t = 144 \quad \text{(2)}
\]
Subtracting equation (2) from (1):
\[
\frac{540}{s} - \frac{540}{s + 2} = 96
\]
Simplifying:
\[
540 \left( \frac{2}{s(s + 2)} \right) = 96
\]
\[
\frac{1080}{s(s + 2)} = 96
\]
\[
s(s + 2) = \frac{1080}{96} = 11.25
\]
Solving the quadratic equation \( s^2 + 2s - 11.25 = 0 \) gives \( s = 2.5 \) km/h (since speed cannot be negative). Substituting \( s = 2.5 \) into equation (1) gives \( t = 24 \) minutes.

When Aya walks at \( s + \frac{1}{2} = 3 \) km/h, the walking time is:
\[
\frac{9}{3} = 3 \text{ hours} = 180 \text{ minutes}
\]
Including the coffee stop, the total time is:
\[
180 + 24 = 204 \text{ minutes}
\]

The final answer is \(\boxed{204}\).
