Okay, so I'm trying to solve this problem where I need to find the smallest base b (where b is at least 2) such that there are more than ten b-eautiful integers. 

First, let me make sure I understand the problem correctly. A number n is called b-eautiful if two conditions are met:
1. When n is written in base b, it has exactly two digits. That means n can be expressed as a two-digit number in base b, which would be something like ab_b, where a and b are digits in base b. But wait, actually, in base b, the digits can't be equal to or larger than b. So, the two digits, let's call them d1 and d2, must satisfy 0 ≤ d1 < b and 0 ≤ d2 < b. But since it's a two-digit number, d1 can't be zero because that would make it a single-digit number. So d1 must be at least 1, and less than b. d2 can be from 0 to b-1.

2. The sum of these two digits equals the square root of n. So, if n is written as d1 d2 in base b, then d1 + d2 = sqrt(n).

The example given is 81 is 13-eautiful. Let's check that: 81 in base 13 is 6*13 + 3 = 81. The digits are 6 and 3, which sum to 9, and sqrt(81) is 9. So that works.

So I need to find the smallest base b where there are more than ten such numbers n.

Let me think about how to model this. So, let's denote n as a two-digit number in base b. So, n = d1 * b + d2, where 1 ≤ d1 < b and 0 ≤ d2 < b.

The condition is that d1 + d2 = sqrt(n). So, sqrt(n) must be an integer because the sum of two integers is an integer. Therefore, n must be a perfect square.

So, for each base b, I need to find all two-digit numbers in base b (i.e., numbers from b to b^2 - 1, since a two-digit number in base b is between b^1 and b^2 - 1) that are perfect squares, and where the sum of their digits in base b equals the square root.

But perhaps a better approach is to model the equation. Let me write this down.

Given n = d1 * b + d2, and d1 + d2 = k, where k is sqrt(n). So, n = k^2. Therefore, d1 * b + d2 = k^2, and d1 + d2 = k.

So, substituting d2 from the second equation into the first, we get:
d1 * b + (k - d1) = k^2
Simplify:
d1 * b + k - d1 = k^2
d1 (b - 1) + k = k^2
Then:
d1 (b - 1) = k^2 - k
So,
d1 = (k^2 - k)/(b - 1)

Since d1 has to be an integer between 1 and b-1, inclusive, (k^2 - k) must be divisible by (b - 1), and the result must be an integer in that range.

Therefore, for each base b, I can find all k where (k^2 - k) is divisible by (b - 1), and the resulting d1 is between 1 and b-1. Then, d2 would be k - d1, which must also be between 0 and b-1.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to express b in terms of k. Let me try that.

From d1 = (k^2 - k)/(b - 1), since d1 is at least 1, (k^2 - k)/(b - 1) ≥ 1, so k^2 - k ≥ b - 1.

Also, d1 must be less than b, so (k^2 - k)/(b - 1) < b. So, k^2 - k < b(b - 1).

But since b is a base we're trying to find, perhaps it's better to think about for each k, what bases b would allow k^2 -k to be divisible by b -1, and d1 and d2 to be valid digits.

Wait, perhaps another approach. Let's consider that n is a two-digit number in base b, so n = d1*b + d2. And n = k^2, and d1 + d2 = k.

So, substituting d2 = k - d1 into n = d1*b + (k - d1):
k^2 = d1*b + k - d1
k^2 = d1*(b - 1) + k
So, d1*(b - 1) = k^2 - k
So, d1 = (k^2 -k)/(b -1)

Since d1 must be an integer between 1 and b-1, inclusive, (b -1) must divide (k^2 -k). So, b -1 divides k(k -1).

So, b = 1 + (k(k -1))/d1, where d1 is a divisor of k(k-1). Also, since d1 must be between 1 and b -1, which is (k(k-1))/d1 -1. Hmm, maybe that's getting a bit too abstract.

Alternatively, for each k, possible values of b can be determined by divisors of k(k -1). Because b-1 must divide k(k-1), so for each k, b-1 is a divisor of k(k-1), meaning b = 1 + d, where d divides k(k-1).

But how does this help us find the number of b-eautiful numbers for each base b?

Alternatively, perhaps for each base b, find all k such that (k^2 -k) is divisible by (b -1), and then check that d1 and d2 are valid digits.

But I think the way to proceed is to iterate over possible bases b, starting from 2 upwards, and for each base, count how many n's satisfy the conditions, and find the smallest b where this count exceeds 10.

But that might take a lot of computation. Alternatively, perhaps I can find a formula or pattern.

Wait, let me think about the equation again: d1 = (k^2 -k)/(b -1). Since d1 must be an integer, (b -1) must be a divisor of (k^2 -k). So, for a given b, we're looking for all k such that (b-1) divides k(k-1), and d1 is between 1 and b-1, and d2 = k - d1 is between 0 and b-1.

Alternatively, for each k, the possible bases b are such that b = 1 + (k(k-1))/d1, where d1 is a positive integer divisor of k(k-1), and d1 is at least 1 and less than or equal to k-1, since d1 <= b-1, and b = 1 + (k(k-1))/d1.

Wait, maybe that's a way to count the number of b-eautiful numbers for each b. Because for each k, the number of possible d1's that divide k(k-1) and satisfy 1 <= d1 <= (k(k-1))/d1 -1. Hmm, perhaps not. Alternatively, for each k, and each divisor d1 of k(k-1), compute b = 1 + (k(k-1))/d1, and then check if d1 is <= b-1, etc. But this might get complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps we can model the number of solutions for each base b. Let me think: for each base b, the number of b-eautiful numbers is the number of integers k such that there exists d1 and d2 where d1 + d2 = k, and n = k^2 = d1*b + d2. Also, d1 must be between 1 and b-1, d2 between 0 and b-1.

So, for a given b, the possible k's must satisfy two conditions:
1. k^2 is a two-digit number in base b, so b <= k^2 < b^2.
2. There exist digits d1 and d2 (with d1 >=1, d2 >=0) such that d1 + d2 = k, and d1*b + d2 = k^2.

We can think of k as being in the range sqrt(b) <= k < b, since k^2 must be >= b (as a two-digit number in base b is at least b) and less than b^2.

So, for each base b, k ranges from floor(sqrt(b)) + 1 (since k has to be an integer, but sqrt(b) may not be integer) up to b-1, because k^2 must be less than b^2, so k < b.

Wait, but k must be at least 2 because for k=1, k^2=1, which is a single-digit number in base b >=2, so it's not a two-digit number. So, k starts from 2 up to b-1.

Wait, let me confirm: for k=2, n=4. In base b, 4 must be represented as a two-digit number, which requires that b <= 4 < b^2. So, for b=2, 4 is 100, which is three digits, so 4 is not a two-digit number in base 2. For b=3, 4 is 11, which is two digits, so yes. So k=2 is acceptable for b=3 and higher.

So, for each base b, k can be from 2 up to floor(b-1). Because k^2 < b^2, so k < b.

So, for each b, k ranges from 2 to b-1.

Now, for each k in that range, we can check if there's a solution for d1 and d2.

From earlier, we have:

d1 = (k^2 -k)/(b -1)
d2 = k - d1

We need d1 to be an integer between 1 and b-1, and d2 between 0 and b-1.

So, for each b, we can iterate k from 2 to b-1 and check if (k^2 -k) is divisible by (b-1), and then verify the digit constraints.

But this would be time-consuming if I have to check each b one by one. Maybe there's a smarter way.

Alternatively, perhaps for each possible k, I can find all possible bases b where b-1 divides k(k-1), then for each such b, add 1 to the count of b-eautiful numbers in that base.

So, for each k >=2, find all bases b where b-1 divides k(k-1), and then for each such b, count the number of valid solutions.

Because each k can contribute to one or more bases b.

So, let's consider that for each k, the number of bases b where b-1 divides k(k-1) is equal to the number of divisors d of k(k-1), since b-1 = d, so b = d + 1.

But for each divisor d of k(k-1), we can compute b = d + 1, and then check if d1 and d2 are within valid ranges.

Wait, but d1 is (k^2 -k)/d, so d1 = k(k -1)/d. Since d divides k(k-1), d1 is an integer.

Then, d1 must satisfy 1 <= d1 <= b -1, which is d1 <= d.

So, substituting d1 = (k(k-1))/d <= d.

Thus, (k(k-1))/d <= d => k(k-1) <= d^2.

Since d divides k(k-1), d is a divisor of k(k-1), so d <= k(k-1). But for each d, we have to check whether k(k-1) <= d^2, which may not always hold.

Alternatively, perhaps for each k, the number of valid bases b is equal to the number of divisors d of k(k-1) where d >= k(k-1)/d, which would mean d^2 >= k(k-1), so d >= sqrt(k(k-1)).

Wait, perhaps that's getting too complicated. Let me think of an example.

Take k=3. Then k(k-1)=3*2=6. The divisors of 6 are 1,2,3,6.

For each d, compute b = d +1. Then compute d1 = (3*2)/d.

So for d=1: b=2, d1=6/1=6. Now, d1 must be <= b-1 =1. But 6>1, so invalid.

d=2: b=3, d1=6/2=3. Check if 3 <= 2 (since b-1=2). 3>2, invalid.

d=3: b=4, d1=6/3=2. Check 2 <=3 (b-1=3), yes. Then d2 =k -d1 =3-2=1. Check if d2 <=3, yes. So this is valid. So for k=3, b=4 is a possible base.

d=6: b=7, d1=6/6=1. Check 1 <=6, yes. d2=3-1=2, which is <=6. So valid. So for k=3, bases b=4 and b=7 are possible. So each k contributes as many bases as the number of divisors d of k(k-1) that are >= sqrt(k(k-1)).

Wait, because d1 = k(k-1)/d must be <= d, so (k(k-1))/d <=d => k(k-1) <=d^2 => d >= sqrt(k(k-1)).

So for each k, the number of valid bases b is equal to the number of divisors d of k(k-1) where d >= sqrt(k(k-1)).

Therefore, for each k, the number of bases b where k contributes a solution is equal to the number of such divisors d.

Now, since each base b is constructed from each k, the total number of b-eautiful numbers for a base b is the sum over k of the number of times b is generated by each k.

Wait, but perhaps I can model this as for each k, the bases b where b-1 is a divisor of k(k-1), and d1 and d2 are valid digits.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to consider that for each k, the number of bases b where a solution exists is equal to the number of divisors d of k(k-1) that are >= sqrt(k(k-1)), as I thought earlier.

Thus, the number of bases where a solution exists for a given k is equal to the number of such divisors.

So, for each k, let me compute the number of bases b that can be formed, and then for each base b, I can accumulate the count of how many solutions (n) it has.

But since I'm looking for the smallest base b where the count exceeds 10, perhaps I can iterate through k's and for each k, find all possible bases b, and for each b, increment a counter. Then, once a base's counter exceeds 10, I can return that base.

But this seems computational. Since I don't have a computer here, perhaps I can find a pattern or mathematical approach.

Let me think about small k's and see how they contribute to different bases.

Take k=2:
k(k-1)=2*1=2. Divisors of 2: 1,2.

For each d in divisors:
d=1: b=2. d1=2/1=2. Check d1 <=1? No. So invalid.
d=2: b=3. d1=2/2=1. Check d1 <=2: yes. d2=2 -1=1. Check d2 <=2: yes. So valid. So k=2 contributes to b=3.

So for b=3, there's one solution from k=2.

k=3:
k(k-1)=6. Divisors:1,2,3,6.

Check each d >= sqrt(6) ≈ 2.45. So d >=3.

d=3: b=4. d1=6/3=2. Check 2 <=3: yes. d2=3-2=1 <=3: yes. Valid.
d=6: b=7. d1=6/6=1 <=6: yes. d2=3-1=2 <=6: yes. Valid.

So k=3 contributes two bases: 4 and 7.

k=4:
k(k-1)=12. Divisors of 12:1,2,3,4,6,12.

So k=4 contributes bases 5,7,13.

So k=6 contributes bases 7,11,16,31.

k=7:
k(k-1)=42. Divisors:1,2,3,6,7,14,21,42.

d >= sqrt(42)≈6.48, so d >=7.

d=7: b=8. d1=42/7=6 <=7: yes. d2=7-6=1 <=7: yes. Valid.
d=14: b=15. d1=42/14=3 <=14: yes. d2=7-3=4 <=14: yes. Valid.

So k=7 contributes bases 8,15,22,43.

k=8:
k(k-1)=56. Divisors:1,2,4,7,8,14,28,56.

So k=9 contributes bases 10,13,19,25,37,73.

k=10:
k(k-1)=90. Divisors:1,2,3,5,6,9,10,15,18,30,45,90.

d >= sqrt(90)=9.486, so d >=10.

d=10: b=11. d1=90/10=9 <=10: yes. d2=10-9=1 <=10: yes. Valid.

So k=10 contributes bases 11,16,19,31,46,91.

k=11:
k(k-1)=110. Divisors:1,2,5,10,11,22,55,110.

d=132: b=133. d1=132/132=1 <=132: yes. d2=12-1=11 <=132: yes. Valid.

So k=12 contributes bases 13,23,34,45,67,133.

Hmm, I can see that as k increases, the number of bases each k contributes also increases, but each base is being contributed to by multiple k's.

But I'm trying to find the smallest b where the total number of b-eautiful numbers (i.e., the count across all k's) is more than 10.

So, for each base b, I can accumulate the number of times it's been contributed to by any k.

Wait, for each k, when we find a base b, that means that for that b, there's at least one solution. But each k can contribute multiple bases, and each base can be contributed to by multiple k's.

So, I need to, for each base b, count how many k's contribute to it, which would be the number of b-eautiful numbers for that base.

So, let's try to track the count for each base as we go through k's.

Let me create a list or a dictionary where the keys are the bases and the values are the counts.

Starting with k=2:

k=2: contributes b=3. So count[3] +=1.

k=3: contributes b=4 and 7. So count[4] +=1, count[7] +=1.

k=4: contributes b=5,7,13. So count[5] +=1, count[7] +=1, count[13] +=1.

k=5: contributes b=6,11,21. So count[6] +=1, count[11] +=1, count[21] +=1.

k=6: contributes b=7,11,16,31. So count[7] +=1, count[11] +=1, count[16] +=1, count[31] +=1.

k=7: contributes b=8,15,22,43. So count[8] +=1, count[15] +=1, count[22] +=1, count[43] +=1.

k=8: contributes b=9,15,29,57. So count[9] +=1, count[15] +=1, count[29] +=1, count[57] +=1.

k=9: contributes b=10,13,19,25,37,73. So count[10] +=1, count[13] +=1, count[19] +=1, count[25] +=1, count[37] +=1, count[73] +=1.

k=10: contributes b=11,16,19,31,46,91. So count[11] +=1, count[16] +=1, count[19] +=1, count[31] +=1, count[46] +=1, count[91] +=1.

k=11: contributes b=12,23,56,111. So count[12] +=1, count[23] +=1, count[56] +=1, count[111] +=1.

k=12: contributes b=13,23,34,45,67,133. So count[13] +=1, count[23] +=1, count[34] +=1, count[45] +=1, count[67] +=1, count[133] +=1.

Now, let's see how many times each base has been counted so far.

Let me list the bases and their counts:

3: 1
4:1
5:1
6:1
7:3 (from k=3,4,6)
8:1
9:1
10:1
11:3 (k=5,6,10)
12:1
13:3 (k=4,9,12)
15:2 (k=7,8)
16:2 (k=6,10)
19:2 (k=9,10)
21:1
22:1
23:2 (k=11,12)
25:1
29:1
31:2 (k=6,10)
34:1
37:1
43:1
45:1
46:1
56:1
57:1
67:1
73:1
91:1
111:1
133:1

Looking at this, the counts are still low. Let's continue with higher k's.

k=13: k(k-1)=13*12=156. Divisors: 1,2,3,4,6,12,13,26,39,52,78,156.

d >= sqrt(156)=12.489, so d >=13.

d=13: b=14. d1=156/13=12 <=13: yes. d2=13-12=1 <=13: yes. Valid.
d=26: b=27. d1=156/26=6 <=26: yes. d2=13-6=7 <=26: yes. Valid.
d=39: b=40. d1=156/39=4 <=39: yes. d2=13-4=9 <=39: yes. Valid.

So k=15 contributes bases 16,22,31,36,43,71,106,211.

k=16: k(k-1)=16*15=240. Divisors:1,2,3,4,5,6,8,10,12,15,16,20,24,30,40,48,60,80,120,240.

So k=16 contributes bases 17,21,25,31,41,49,61,81,121,241.

Let me add these to the counts:

For k=13:
14:1
27:1
40:1
53:1
79:1
157:1

For k=14:
15: count was 2, now +=1 →3
27: count was 1, now +=1 →2
92:1
183:1

For k=15:
16: count was 2, +=1 →3
22: count was1, +=1 →2
31: count was2, +=1 →3
36:1
43: count was1, +=1 →2
71:1
106:1
211:1

For k=16:
17:1
21: count was1, +=1 →2
25:1
31: count was3, +=1 →4
41:1
49:1
61:1
81:1
121:1
241:1

Now, looking at the counts:

Looking at the counts, some bases are getting higher counts. Let's check which ones.

Looking at base 31: count is now 4.

Looking for bases where count exceeds 10.

Hmm, perhaps I need to go higher with k.

k=17: k(k-1)=17*16=272. Divisors:1,2,4,8,16,17,34,68,136,272.

d >= sqrt(272)=16.49, so d >=17.

d=17: b=18. d1=272/17=16 <=17: yes. d2=17-16=1 <=17: yes. Valid.
d=34: b=35. d1=272/34=8 <=34: yes. d2=17-8=9 <=34: yes. Valid.
d=68: b=69. d1=272/68=4 <=68: yes. d2=17-4=13 <=68: yes. Valid.
d=136: b=137. d1=272/136=2 <=136: yes. d2=17-2=15 <=136: yes. Valid.
d=272: b=273. d1=272/272=1 <=272: yes. d2=17-1=16 <=272: yes. Valid.

So k=17 contributes bases 18,35,69,137,273.

Similarly, for k=18:

k(k-1)=18*17=306. Divisors:1,2,3,6,9,17,18,34,51,102,153,306.

d >= sqrt(306)=17.49, so d >=18.

d=18: b=19. d1=306/18=17 <=18: yes. d2=18-17=1 <=18: yes. Valid.
d=34: b=35. d1=306/34=9 <=34: yes. d2=18-9=9 <=34: yes. Valid.
d=51: b=52. d1=306/51=6 <=51: yes. d2=18-6=12 <=51: yes. Valid.
d=102: b=103. d1=306/102=3 <=102: yes. d2=18-3=15 <=102: yes. Valid.
d=153: b=154. d1=306/153=2 <=153: yes. d2=18-2=16 <=153: yes. Valid.
d=306: b=307. d1=306/306=1 <=306: yes. d2=18-1=17 <=306: yes. Valid.

So k=18 contributes bases 19,35,52,103,154,307.

Adding these to counts:

k=17:
18:1
35:1
69:1
137:1
273:1

k=18:
19:1
35: count was1, +=1 →2
52:1
103:1
154:1
307:1

Now, let's see the counts for some bases:

Looking for any base with count >10.

For example, base 31: count is 4.

Not enough. Let's go further.

k=19: k(k-1)=19*18=342. Divisors:1,2,3,6,9,18,19,38,57,114,171,342.

d >= sqrt(342)=18.49, so d >=19.

d=19: b=20. d1=342/19=18 <=19: yes. d2=19-18=1 <=19: yes. Valid.
d=38: b=39. d1=342/38=9 <=38: yes. d2=19-9=10 <=38: yes. Valid.
d=57: b=58. d1=342/57=6 <=57: yes. d2=19-6=13 <=57: yes. Valid.
d=114: b=115. d1=342/114=3 <=114: yes. d2=19-3=16 <=114: yes. Valid.
d=171: b=172. d1=342/171=2 <=171: yes. d2=19-2=17 <=171: yes. Valid.
d=342: b=343. d1=342/342=1 <=342: yes. d2=19-1=18 <=342: yes. Valid.

So k=19 contributes bases 20,39,58,115,172,343.

k=20: k(k-1)=20*19=380. Divisors:1,2,4,5,10,19,20,38,76,95,190,380.

d >= sqrt(380)=19.49, so d >=20.

d=20: b=21. d1=380/20=19 <=20: yes. d2=20-19=1 <=20: yes. Valid.
d=38: b=39. d1=380/38=10 <=38: yes. d2=20-10=10 <=38: yes. Valid.
d=76: b=77. d1=380/76=5 <=76: yes. d2=20-5=15 <=76: yes. Valid.
d=95: b=96. d1=380/95=4 <=95: yes. d2=20-4=16 <=95: yes. Valid.
d=190: b=191. d1=380/190=2 <=190: yes. d2=20-2=18 <=190: yes. Valid.
d=380: b=381. d1=380/380=1 <=380: yes. d2=20-1=19 <=380: yes. Valid.

So k=20 contributes bases 21,39,77,96,191,381.

Adding these:

k=19:
20:1
39:1
58:1
115:1
172:1
343:1

k=20:
21: count was2, +=1 →3
39: count was1, +=1 →2
77:1
96:1
191:1
381:1

Now, looking for bases with count >10. Let's see:

Base 31: count 4.

Hmm, this is taking a while. Maybe I should think of a different approach.

Alternatively, perhaps the number of solutions for a base b is equal to the number of k's such that b-1 divides k(k-1), and d1 and d2 are valid digits.

But perhaps for a given b, the number of possible k's is equal to the number of divisors d of b-1 that are factors of k(k-1), but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps using the fact that for each k, the number of bases contributed is equal to the number of divisors of k(k-1) that are >= sqrt(k(k-1)), as I thought earlier.

Since each such divisor d contributes to a base b = d +1, and for each b, the number of times it's contributed to is equal to the number of k's for which b-1 is a divisor of k(k-1) and d >= sqrt(k(k-1)).

But maybe it's better to consider that for a given b, the number of b-eautiful numbers is equal to the number of k's such that (b -1) divides k(k-1) and k^2 is a two-digit number in base b, i.e., b <=k^2 <b^2.

Wait, perhaps for each base b, the number of solutions is equal to the number of k's where:
- k(k-1) is divisible by (b-1), i.e., (b-1) | k(k-1),
- and k^2 >=b (so k >=sqrt(b)),
- and k^2 <b^2 (so k <b).

So, for each b, the number of k's is the number of integers k in [sqrt(b), b-1] such that (b-1) divides k(k-1).

Now, (b-1) divides k(k-1) implies that (b-1) divides k or (b-1) divides (k-1), but that's not necessarily correct because (b-1) could have factors that divide both k and k-1, but since k and k-1 are coprime, the factors must divide either k or k-1.

Wait, since k and k-1 are consecutive integers, they are coprime. Therefore, (b-1) must be a divisor of k or a divisor of (k-1). So, either (b-1) divides k or (b-1) divides (k-1).

But since k < b, because k^2 <b^2, and k >= sqrt(b).

So, let's consider that.

Case 1: (b-1) divides k.

But since k <b, and (b-1) divides k, the only possibility is that k = b-1, but since k <b, that would imply k = b-1. But then (b-1) divides (b-1), which is true. So, for k =b-1, (b-1) divides k.

Case 2: (b-1) divides (k-1).

Since k-1 <b-1 (because k <b), the only way (b-1) divides (k-1) is if k-1=0, which would imply k=1, but k >=2, so this is impossible.

Wait, that can't be right. Because if (b-1) divides (k-1), then (k-1) must be a multiple of (b-1). But since k <b, (k-1) can be at most b-2, which is less than (b-1). So the only multiple possible is 0, which would imply k=1, which is less than our lower bound of k=2.

So, the only possible case is when (b-1) divides k. But since k <b, the only k that satisfies this is k = b-1.

So, for each base b, the only possible k is k =b-1.

Wait, but this contradicts the earlier examples. For instance, in the example given, 81 is 13-eautiful. Let's check:

b=13, so k must be 13-1=12. Then, n=k^2=144. But wait, in base 13, 144 is represented as something else. Wait, earlier the example was 81 is 13-eautiful. Let me check that again.

Wait, 81 in base 13 is 6*13 + 3 = 81, which is correct. Then, 6+3=9, which is sqrt(81). So, k=9. But according to my earlier logic, for b=13, the only possible k is 12. But this is not the case. So my conclusion that only k =b-1 is possible is incorrect.

So, my earlier assumption that because k <b, the only possibility is k =b-1 is wrong. Therefore, I must have made a mistake in that reasoning.

Let me correct this. Since k and k-1 are coprime, (b-1) must divide either k or k-1. But since k <b, (b-1) is greater than k-1, except when k-1 >= (b-1)/something.

Wait, no. Let me think again.

Because (b-1) divides k(k-1), and since k and k-1 are coprime, (b-1) must be a product of factors from k and k-1. So, (b-1) can be written as d1*d2, where d1 divides k and d2 divides k-1, and d1 and d2 are coprime.

But since k and k-1 are coprime, d1 and d2 must also be coprime. So, the number of solutions is the number of ways to write (b-1) as a product d1*d2 where d1 divides k and d2 divides (k-1), for some k in [sqrt(b), b-1].

But this seems complicated. Alternatively, perhaps it's better to think of (b-1) as a divisor of k(k-1), which can happen if (b-1) divides k or (b-1) divides k-1, but since k <b, the only way (b-1) divides k is if k =b-1, but that's only possible if k= b-1 <b, which is true. Similarly, (b-1) divides k-1 would require that k-1 >= (b-1), but since k <b, k-1 <=b-2 <b-1, so that's impossible. Therefore, the only possible k is k =b-1.

But this contradicts the example where k=9 and b=13. Because 13-1=12, but k=9 in that case. So, where is the mistake?

Wait, because in the example, (b-1)=12. So, 12 divides k(k-1)=9*8=72. Indeed, 72 divided by 12 is 6, which is d1=6. And d2=3. So, 6+3=9.

So, in this case, (b-1)=12 divides k(k-1)=72, and 12 is a divisor of 72. But 12 is not a divisor of k=9 or k-1=8. So, this shows that my earlier reasoning was incorrect. So, (b-1) can divide k(k-1) even if it doesn't divide k or k-1 individually, as long as the prime factors are distributed between k and k-1.

Therefore, the initial approach that (b-1) must divide k or k-1 is incorrect. Hence, I have to abandon that line of reasoning.

Thus, perhaps the only way is to compute for each base b, the number of k's such that (b-1) divides k(k-1), and k is in [sqrt(b), b-1]. For each such k, check if d1 and d2 are valid digits.

But doing this manually for each b up to a point where the count exceeds 10 is going to be time-consuming, but perhaps manageable.

Alternatively, perhaps I can find a pattern or formula for the number of solutions per base.

Wait, perhaps for a given b, the number of solutions is equal to the number of divisors of (b-1) that are less than or equal to (b-1)/2. Because for each divisor d of (b-1), we can set d1 = (k^2 -k)/(b-1). Wait, no, perhaps not.

Alternatively, let's think of (b-1) as m. So, m = b-1. Then, for each divisor d of m, we can set d1 = (k^2 -k)/m. But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps an alternative approach: For a given m =b-1, the number of solutions is equal to the number of pairs (d1, d2) such that d1 + d2 =k, and d1*m +d2 =k^2.

Wait, but that's the same as the earlier equation.

Alternatively, perhaps for each m, the number of solutions is equal to the number of k's such that m divides k(k-1), and k is in [sqrt(m+1), m].

Wait, because b =m+1, and k must be >=sqrt(b) =sqrt(m+1), and k <b =m+1.

So, for each m, the number of k's is the number of integers k in [sqrt(m+1), m] such that m divides k(k-1).

So, for each m >=1, compute the number of k's in [sqrt(m+1), m] where m divides k(k-1).

But how to compute this?

Let me take m=12, which corresponds to b=13.

m=12. So, k must be in [sqrt(13), 12], so k=4 to 12.

Check for each k if 12 divides k(k-1).

k=4: 4*3=12, which is divisible by 12. Yes.

k=5:5*4=20. 20 mod12=8. No.

k=6:6*5=30. 30 mod12=6. No.

k=7:7*6=42. 42 mod12=6. No.

k=8:8*7=56. 56 mod12=8. No.

k=9:9*8=72. 72 mod12=0. Yes.

k=10:10*9=90. 90 mod12=6. No.

k=11:11*10=110. 110 mod12= 110 - 9*12=110-108=2. No.

k=12:12*11=132. 132 mod12=0. Yes.

So for m=12, the valid k's are 4,9,12. So three solutions.

Thus, b=13 has three b-eautiful numbers.

Wait, but earlier, when we processed k=4,9,12, how did they contribute to base 13?

From earlier:

k=4 contributed to b=5,7,13.

k=9 contributed to b=10,13,19,25,37,73.

k=12 contributed to b=13,23,34,45,67,133.

So, in the counts, base 13 had contributions from k=4,9,12, giving it a count of 3.

Which matches the manual count here.

So, for each m, the number of solutions is equal to the number of k's in [sqrt(m+1), m] where m divides k(k-1).

So, perhaps for each m, we can compute this number and find when it exceeds 10.

But I need to find the smallest b where the number of b-eautiful numbers exceeds 10. Since b =m+1, I can iterate m from 1 upwards, compute the number of k's for each m, and find the first m where the count is >10.

But doing this manually is tedious. Perhaps I can look for m where the number of k's is high. For example, m=24.

Let's try m=24 (b=25).

Compute k in [sqrt(25)=5, 24].

Check for each k in 5 to24 if 24 divides k(k-1).

24's prime factors: 2^3*3.

So, k(k-1) must be divisible by 24.

Since k and k-1 are consecutive, one is even, and among any two consecutive numbers, one is even and at least one is divisible by 4, and one is divisible by 3.

So, for k(k-1) to be divisible by 24, it's sufficient that one of k or k-1 is divisible by 8, or one divisible by 4 and the other by 2, along with one divisible by 3.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to list all k in 5<=k<=24 where 24 divides k(k-1).

Let me compute:

k=5: 5*4=20. 20 mod24=20. No.

k=6:6*5=30. 30 mod24=6. No.

k=7:7*6=42. 42 mod24=18. No.

k=8:8*7=56. 56 mod24=8. No.

k=9:9*8=72. 72 mod24=0. Yes.

k=10:10*9=90. 90 mod24= 90-3*24=90-72=18. No.

k=11:11*10=110. 110 mod24= 110-4*24=110-96=14. No.

k=12:12*11=132. 132 mod24=132-5*24=12. No, because 5*24=120, 132-120=12. So 132 mod24=12. Not 0. Wait, but 132/24=5.5, so remainder 12. So no.

Wait, but 12*11=132, which is 5*24 + 12. So remainder 12. So no.

k=13:13*12=156. 156 mod24= 156 -6*24=156-144=12. No.

k=14:14*13=182. 182 mod24= 182-7*24=182-168=14. No.

k=15:15*14=210. 210 mod24= 210-8*24=210-192=18. No.

k=16:16*15=240. 240 mod24=0. Yes.

k=17:17*16=272. 272 mod24= 272 -11*24=272-264=8. No.

k=18:18*17=306. 306 mod24=306-12*24=306-288=18. No.

k=19:19*18=342. 342 mod24=342-14*24=342-336=6. No.

k=20:20*19=380. 380 mod24= 380-15*24=380-360=20. No.

k=21:21*20=420. 420 mod24=420-17*24=420-408=12. No.

k=22:22*21=462. 462 mod24=462-19*24=462-456=6. No.

k=23:23*22=506. 506 mod24=506-21*24=506-504=2. No.

k=24:24*23=552. 552 mod24=0. Yes.

So, for m=24, the valid k's are 9,16,24. So three solutions.

Hmm, but that's not exceeding 10. Let's try m=60 (b=61).

Check k from sqrt(61)≈7.81 up to 60.

We need to find k in 8 to60 where 60 divides k(k-1).

60=2^2*3*5.

Since k and k-1 are consecutive, one is even, and one is divisible by 4. Also, one is divisible by 3, and one by 5.

So, for 60 to divide k(k-1), the product must be divisible by 4, 3, and 5.

Which happens if:
- One of k or k-1 is divisible by 4, and another divisible by 2 (but since they're consecutive, if one is divisible by 4, the other is even but not divisible by 4, so that's covered).
- One of k or k-1 is divisible by 3.
- One of k or k-1 is divisible by 5.

So, the possible k's are those where k or k-1 is divisible by 5, and either k or k-1 is divisible by 3, and either k or k-1 is divisible by 4.

This is a bit involved, but let me try to find all such k in 8<=k<=60.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to note that 60 divides k(k-1) if and only if k ≡0 or 1 mod 5, and k ≡0 or 1 mod 4, and k ≡0 or 1 mod 3.

Wait, no, because if k is divisible by 5, then k-1 is not, and vice versa.

Wait, perhaps it's better to list all k where k ≡0 or 1 mod 5, and k ≡0 or 1 mod 4, and k ≡0 or 1 mod 3.

But that might take a while. Alternatively, perhaps I can note that the number of such k's is equal to the number of integers in [8,60] where k ≡0 or 1 mod 60's factors. Hmm, not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps I can compute this by noting that 60 divides k(k-1) if and only if k ≡0 or 1 mod 60, but that's only if k or k-1 is 60. So that's not correct.

Wait, no, because 60 can divide k(k-1) even if neither k nor k-1 is 60. For example, if k=16, k-1=15, which is divisible by 5 and 3, and k=16 is divisible by 4.

So, 16*15=240, which is divisible by 60.

So, let's see:

k=16: yes.

k=15: no, because 15 is less than 8? No, k starts at 8.

Wait, let me think of another approach.

Since 60 divides k(k-1), then k(k-1) must be a multiple of 60.

Given that, let's find all k in [8,60] such that 60 divides k(k-1).

This can be done by checking for each k whether 60 divides k(k-1).

But that's time-consuming. Alternatively, perhaps note that the numbers k where 60 divides k(k-1) are those where either k ≡0 mod 60, k ≡1 mod 60, or where k is a multiple of some factors of 60 and k-1 another.

But perhaps a better approach is to note that since 60=4*3*5, and k and k-1 are consecutive, one of them must be divisible by 4, one by 3, and one by 5.

So, for each k in [8,60], check if:
- Either k or k-1 is divisible by 4,
- Either k or k-1 is divisible by 3,
- Either k or k-1 is divisible by 5.

If all three conditions are met, then 60 divides k(k-1).

So, let's list all such k:

Start with k=8:
Check:
- 8 is divisible by 4,
- 8-1=7 not divisible by 3,
- 8 not divisible by 5, 7 not divisible by 5. So no.

k=9:
-9 not divisible by 4,
-9 divisible by 3,
-9 not divisible by 5, 8 not divisible by 5. So no.

k=10:
-10 not divisible by 4,
-10 not divisible by 3,
-10 divisible by 5. But 4 and 3 conditions not met. So no.

k=11:
-11 not divisible by 4,
-11 not divisible by 3,
-11 not divisible by 5, 10 not divisible by 5 (wait, 10 is divisible by 5). So, k=11: 11-1=10, which is divisible by 5. But 4 and 3 conditions: 11 not divisible by 4, 10 not divisible by 4; 11 not divisible by 3, 10 not divisible by 3. So no.

k=12:
-12 divisible by 4,
-12 divisible by 3,
-12 not divisible by 5, 11 not. So no.

k=13:
-13 not divisible by 4,
-13 not divisible by 3,

k=14:
-14 not divisible by 4,
-14 not divisible by 3,
-14 not divisible by 5, 13 not. So no.

k=20:
-20 divisible by 4,
-20 not divisible by 3,
-20 divisible by 5. So, 20 divisible by 4 and 5, but 3 condition: 20-1=19 not divisible by 3. So no.

k=21:

k=60 is valid.

So, the valid k's for m=60 are: 16,21,25,28,33,36,37,40,41,46,49,52,53,55,56,57,58,60.

That's 18 solutions.

So, for m=60, the number of solutions is 18, which would mean that base b=61 has 18 b-eautiful numbers, which is more than 10.

But I'm looking for the smallest b where the count exceeds 10. So perhaps 61 is the answer. But let me check if there's a smaller m where the count is >10.

Wait, let's try m=36 (b=37).

Compute the number of k's in [6,36] where 36 divides k(k-1).

36=4*9.

So, k(k-1) must be divisible by 4 and 9.

Since k and k-1 are consecutive, one is even and one is odd. For divisibility by 4, either k or k-1 must be divisible by 4.

For divisibility by 9, either k or k-1 must be divisible by 9.

So, let's find all k in [6,36] where either k or k-1 is divisible by 4 and either k or k-1 is divisible by 9.

List:

k=9: k-1=8, which is divisible by 4. So yes.

k=10: k-1=9, which is divisible by 9. 10 is even, but not divisible by 4. 9 is divisible by 9. So yes.

k=16: k divisible by 4. k-1=15, which is not divisible by 9. So no.

Wait, 16: 16*15=240. 240 mod36=240-6*36=240-216=24. Not 0. So no.

Wait, perhaps I should double-check.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to compute for each k in [6,36] whether 36 divides k(k-1).

k=6:6*5=30. 30 mod36=30. No.

k=7:7*6=42. 42 mod36=6. No.

k=8:8*7=56. 56 mod36=20. No.

k=9:9*8=72. 72 mod36=0. Yes.

k=17:17*16=272. 272 mod36=272-7*36=272-252=20. No.

k=18:18*17=306. 306 mod36=306-8*36=306-288=18. No.

k=19:19*18=342. 342 mod36=342-9*36=342-324=18. No.

k=20:20*19=380. 380 mod36=380-10*36=380-360=20. No.

k=21:21*20=420. 420 mod36=420-11*36=420-396=24. No.

k=22:22*21=462. 462 mod36=462-12*36=462-432=30. No.

k=23:23*22=506. 506 mod36=506-14*36=506-504=2. No.

k=26:26*25=650. 650 mod36=650-18*36=650-648=2. No.

k=27:27*26=702. 702 mod36=702-19*36=702-684=18. No.

k=28:28*27=756. 756 mod36=756-21*36=756-756=0. Yes.

k=29:29*28=812. 812 mod36=812-22*36=812-792=20. No.

k=30:30*29=870. 870 mod36=870-24*36=870-864=6. No.

k=31:31*30=930. 930 mod36=930-25*36=930-900=30. No.

k=32:32*31=992. 992 mod36=992-27*36=992-972=20. No.

k=33:33*32=1056. 1056 mod36=1056-29*36=1056-1044=12. No.

k=34:34*33=1122. 1122 mod36=1122-31*36=1122-1116=6. No.

k=35:35*34=1190. 1190 mod36=1190-33*36=1190-1188=2. No.

k=36:36*35=1260. 1260 mod36=0. Yes.

So, valid k's are 9,28,36. That's three solutions.

Hmm, not enough. Let's try m=60, which gave 18 solutions. So, base 61 has 18 solutions. But is there a smaller m where the number of solutions is >10?

Wait, let me check m=48 (b=49).

Compute k in [7,48] where 48 divides k(k-1).

48=16*3.

k(k-1) must be divisible by 16 and 3.

Since k and k-1 are consecutive, one is even, and one is divisible by 16 or 8.

Wait, let's list the valid k's:

k must be such that either k or k-1 is divisible by 16, and either k or k-1 is divisible by 3.

So, possible k's are:

k=16: 16*15=240, which is divisible by 48. Yes.

k=17:17*16=272. 272 mod48=272-5*48=272-240=32. No.

k=24:24*23=552. 552 mod48=552-11*48=552-528=24. No.

k=25:25*24=600. 600 mod48=600-12*48=600-576=24. No.

k=32:32*31=992. 992 mod48=992-20*48=992-960=32. No.

k=33:33*32=1056. 1056 mod48=0. Yes.

k=40:40*39=1560. 1560 mod48=1560-32*48=1560-1536=24. No.

k=41:41*40=1640. 1640 mod48=1640-34*48=1640-1632=8. No.

k=48:48*47=2256. 2256 mod48=0. Yes.

So, valid k's are 16,33,48. So three solutions.

Not enough. Let's try m=60 again, which had 18 solutions. So, base 61 has 18 solutions. That's more than 10. Is there a smaller m where the count is >10?

Wait, perhaps m=24 (b=25) had 3 solutions, m=36 (b=37) had 3, m=48 (b=49) had 3, m=60 (b=61) had 18.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake earlier. Let me check m=30 (b=31).

Compute the number of k's where 30 divides k(k-1), k in [6,30].

30=2*3*5.

So, k(k-1) must be divisible by 2,3,5.

Since k and k-1 are consecutive, one is even, one is divisible by 3, and one is divisible by 5.

So, let's list the k's:

k=6:6*5=30, divisible by 30. Yes.

k=10:10*9=90, divisible by 30. Yes.

k=15:15*14=210, divisible by 30. Yes.

k=16:16*15=240, divisible by 30. Yes.

k=21:21*20=420, divisible by 30. Yes.

k=25:25*24=600, divisible by 30. Yes.

k=30:30*29=870, divisible by 30. Yes.

Wait, that's 7 solutions. So for m=30, the number of solutions is 7, which is still less than 10.

Wait, but earlier when I considered m=60, which is double of 30, I had 18 solutions. So perhaps the number of solutions increases as m increases, especially when m has more factors.

Wait, but I'm trying to find the smallest m where the number of solutions exceeds 10. So, m=60 gives 18 solutions, but perhaps a smaller m with more factors could give more than 10.

Let me check m=24 again. Wait, earlier I found m=24 had 3 solutions, but perhaps I missed some.

Wait, m=24, b=25.

k in [5,24].

Looking for k where 24 divides k(k-1).

Let me list the k's:

k=5:5*4=20. 20 mod24=20. No.

k=6:6*5=30. 30 mod24=6. No.

k=7:7*6=42. 42 mod24=18. No.

k=8:8*7=56. 56 mod24=8. No.

k=9:9*8=72. 72 mod24=0. Yes.

k=10:10*9=90. 90 mod24=18. No.

k=11:11*10=110. 110 mod24=2. No.

k=12:12*11=132. 132 mod24=12. No.

k=13:13*12=156. 156 mod24=12. No.

k=14:14*13=182. 182 mod24=14. No.

k=15:15*14=210. 210 mod24=6. No.

k=16:16*15=240. 240 mod24=0. Yes.

k=17:17*16=272. 272 mod24=8. No.

k=18:18*17=306. 306 mod24=6. No.

k=19:19*18=342. 342 mod24=6. No.

k=20:20*19=380. 380 mod24=20. No.

k=21:21*20=420. 420 mod24=12. No.

k=22:22*21=462. 462 mod24=6. No.

k=23:23*22=506. 506 mod24=2. No.

k=24:24*23=552. 552 mod24=0. Yes.

So, valid k's are 9,16,24: three solutions.

Hmm, not enough.

Wait, perhaps m=60 is the first m where the count exceeds 10, with 18 solutions. So, the base is 61.

But earlier, when I considered k=16, it contributed to b=17, which is m=16.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the earlier process, and the count for m=60 is actually the first to exceed 10.

But let me think again. If m=60, then the base is 61, and it has 18 solutions, which is more than 10. So, 61 would be the answer.

But let me check m=48 again, perhaps I missed some k's.

Wait, for m=48, I had k=16,33,48, but when I checked, only those three worked. So, 3 solutions.

Wait, maybe m=30 had 7 solutions, m=60 had 18 solutions. So, 61 is the first base where the count exceeds 10.

Thus, the least integer b is 61.
Okay, so I have this problem here where I need to find the smallest integer base b (where b is at least 2) such that there are more than ten b-eautiful integers. A number n is called b-eautiful if two conditions are met: first, when expressed in base b, it has exactly two digits. Second, the sum of these two digits equals the square root of n. 

Let me break this down. If a number n is written in base b as a two-digit number, that means it can be expressed as n = a*b + c, where a and c are digits in base b. Since it's a two-digit number, a can't be zero, so a is at least 1 and at most b-1. Similarly, c can be from 0 to b-1. 

The second condition is that the sum of the two digits a + c equals the square root of n. So, sqrt(n) must be an integer because a and c are integers, and their sum is also an integer. Therefore, n must be a perfect square. 

So, putting these together, we have:
1. n = a*b + c
2. a + c = sqrt(n)
3. Since n is a perfect square, let's let k = sqrt(n), so n = k^2.

Therefore, substituting into equation 1, we get:
k^2 = a*b + c

And from equation 2, c = k - a.

Substituting c into equation 1:
k^2 = a*b + (k - a)
=> k^2 = a*b + k - a
=> k^2 - k = a*(b - 1)
=> a = (k^2 - k)/(b - 1)

Since a must be an integer between 1 and b-1, (k^2 - k) must be divisible by (b - 1), and the result a must satisfy 1 ≤ a ≤ b - 1.

So, for each base b, we can find all integers k such that (k^2 - k) is divisible by (b - 1), and the corresponding a is between 1 and b - 1. Each such k will give a valid n, which is b-eautiful.

Our goal is to find the smallest b such that the number of such k's (and hence the number of b-eautiful numbers) exceeds 10.

Hmm, okay. So for each b, we need to count how many k's satisfy these conditions. Let's formalize this a bit.

Let me denote d = b - 1. Then, a = (k^2 - k)/d. So, for a to be an integer, d must divide (k^2 - k). That is, (k^2 - k) mod d = 0.

Since d = b - 1, and b is at least 2, d is at least 1.

Moreover, a must satisfy 1 ≤ a ≤ d, since a is a digit in base b. So:

1 ≤ (k^2 - k)/d ≤ d
=> d ≤ k^2 - k ≤ d^2

So, k must satisfy d ≤ k^2 - k ≤ d^2.

But d = b - 1, which is positive, so we can write:

b - 1 ≤ k^2 - k ≤ (b - 1)^2

But since k^2 - k must be equal to a*(b -1), and a is at least 1, the smallest possible k^2 -k is b -1, which occurs when a=1. Similarly, the maximum possible k^2 -k is (b -1)^2, when a = b -1.

So, for each b, the possible k's are those integers k where (b -1) ≤ k^2 -k ≤ (b -1)^2.

Moreover, since k = sqrt(n), and n is a two-digit number in base b, n must be less than b^2. Because the maximum two-digit number in base b is (b-1)*b + (b-1) = b^2 - 1. So, n < b^2, hence k = sqrt(n) < b. Therefore, k can be at most b -1, since it's an integer. So, k can range from, let's see, let's find the minimum k.

Wait, k is sqrt(n), and n is a two-digit number in base b, so n is at least b (the smallest two-digit number in base b is 10_b, which is equal to b in decimal). Therefore, k must be at least sqrt(b). But since k is an integer, k is at least ceil(sqrt(b)).

Wait, but for the lower bound, let's think. The smallest two-digit number in base b is b, so the smallest k is sqrt(b). But since k must be an integer, k must be at least the ceiling of sqrt(b). However, if sqrt(b) is not an integer, the smallest k is floor(sqrt(b)) + 1, but perhaps it's better to just consider k as integers such that k^2 is between b and (b^2 -1).

So, k can range from ceil(sqrt(b)) up to floor(sqrt(b^2 - 1)) = b -1.

So, for each b, the possible k's are integers from ceil(sqrt(b)) to b -1. But not all these k's will satisfy the condition that (k^2 -k) is divisible by (b -1) and that a = (k^2 -k)/(b -1) is between 1 and b -1.

Hmm. So, for each b, we can iterate over k from ceil(sqrt(b)) to b -1, check if (k^2 - k) is divisible by (b -1), and if the resulting a is within the digit range.

But since the problem asks for the minimal b where there are more than ten such numbers, it's probably better to model this in terms of divisors. Let me think.

Given that (k^2 -k) must be divisible by d = b -1, so d divides k(k -1). So, d must divide the product of two consecutive integers, k and k -1. Since k and k -1 are coprime (consecutive integers are always coprime), d must divide either k or k -1, or be a product of factors from each.

Wait, but d could be any divisor of k(k -1). Since k and k-1 are coprime, the divisors of k(k-1) are products of the divisors of k and k-1.

So, d = b -1 can be any divisor of k(k-1). Therefore, for each k, the possible d's (i.e., b -1) are the divisors of k(k -1). Thus, for each k, we can set d as any divisor of k(k -1), which would give a possible b = d + 1.

But in our problem, we are looking for the minimal b such that the number of possible k's (hence n's) is more than ten. So, perhaps for each b, the number of k's is equal to the number of divisors d of k(k -1) such that d = b -1, but that seems a bit tangled.

Alternatively, perhaps we can think of for each b, the number of k's such that d = b -1 divides k(k -1). Since k and k -1 are coprime, d must be a product of factors from k and k -1, but given that d is fixed for a given b, perhaps the number of k's for a given b is equal to the number of solutions to k(k -1) ≡ 0 mod d.

Wait, perhaps another approach. For each d, how many k's satisfy k(k -1) ≡ 0 mod d? Since d = b -1, and b can be any integer >=2, d can be any integer >=1.

So, for each d, the number of k in [ceil(sqrt(d +1)), d] such that d divides k(k -1).

Wait, but k must be in the range from ceil(sqrt(d +1)) to d, since k <= b -1 = d.

But perhaps that's getting too ahead. Let's think in terms of how many k's satisfy d divides k(k -1). Since d is fixed, the number of such k's in a certain range is equal to the number of k's where either k ≡ 0 mod d or k ≡ 1 mod d, but considering that d can have multiple prime factors.

Wait, no. Because d divides k(k -1), and since k and k -1 are coprime, d must be a product of factors of k and k -1. So, for each prime power in d, it must divide either k or k -1. So, the number of k's that satisfy this is equal to the product over each prime power in d of the number of ways to assign that prime power to either k or k -1. But this might be complicated.

Alternatively, the number of k's in [1, d] such that d divides k(k -1) is 2^{m}, where m is the number of distinct prime factors of d. Wait, is that correct?

Wait, let me test for small d. Take d=6. Its prime factors are 2 and 3. So m=2, so 2^2=4. Let's see:

k in 1 to 6:

k=1: 1*0=0, 6 divides 0: yes
k=2: 2*1=2, 6 doesn't divide 2: no
k=3: 3*2=6, yes
k=4: 4*3=12, yes (12 mod 6=0)
k=5:5*4=20, 20 mod6=2: no
k=6:6*5=30, yes.

So, k=1,3,4,6 satisfy the condition. That's 4, which is 2^2. So yes, for d=6, which has two prime factors, the number of k's is 4.

Another example: d=4, which has one prime factor (2). So 2^1=2. Let's check:

k=1: 0: yes
k=2:2*1=2: 4 doesn't divide 2: no
k=3:3*2=6: no
k=4:4*3=12: yes

So, k=1 and k=4: two, which is 2^1. So it works.

Another example: d=8. Prime factors: 2^3, but the number of distinct primes is 1. So number of k's should be 2.

Check k=1: 0: yes
k=2:2*1=2: 8 doesn't divide 2: no
k=3:6: no
k=4:12: 8 doesn't divide 12: no
k=5:20: no
k=6:30: no
k=7:42: no
k=8:56: yes.

So only k=1 and k=8: two, which is 2^1. Correct.

So the number of k's in 1..d where d divides k(k-1) is indeed 2^{m}, where m is the number of distinct prime factors of d.

Wait, but in our problem, k is not in 1..d, but in [ceil(sqrt(d+1)), d]. Because k must be at least sqrt(b) = sqrt(d +1), and at most d. So the number of k's in this range that satisfy d divides k(k-1) is not exactly 2^{m}, but depends on how many of those k's fall into the specified range.

Hmm. So, for each d, the possible k's are those congruent to 0 or 1 mod primes in the factorization of d. But perhaps to find the number of k's in [ceil(sqrt(d +1)), d] that satisfy d divides k(k-1), we can consider the number of solutions to k ≡ 0 mod p or k ≡ 1 mod p for each prime p dividing d.

Wait, this seems complicated. Maybe I can model this as follows:

Given d, the number of k's in [1, d] such that d divides k(k-1) is 2^{m}, where m is the number of distinct prime factors of d. But in our case, k must be in [ceil(sqrt(d +1)), d], so the number of k's is the number of solutions in this range.

So, for a given d, the number of k's in [1, d] that satisfy d divides k(k-1) is 2^{m}, as previously.

But some of these k's might be less than ceil(sqrt(d +1)), so we need to subtract those.

Wait, but for small d, the first few k's (like k=1) might be below sqrt(d +1). So, for each d, the number of k's satisfying the condition and k >= ceil(sqrt(d +1)) would be 2^{m} minus the number of k's that are less than ceil(sqrt(d +1)).

But this seems complicated because it depends on the specific d.

Alternatively, perhaps for each d, the number of possible k's is equal to the number of divisors of d, but I'm not sure.

Wait, maybe a better approach: for each b, d = b -1.

We can model a = (k^2 -k)/d.

We need a to be integer and 1 <= a <= d.

So, (k^2 -k) must be divisible by d, and (k^2 -k)/d must be between 1 and d.

So, for each b, the number of k's is equal to the number of integers k in [ceil(sqrt(b)), b -1] such that d | (k^2 -k) and 1 <= (k^2 -k)/d <= d.

Let me denote f(k, d) = (k^2 -k)/d.

We need f(k, d) to be integer and 1 <= f(k, d) <= d.

So for each d, the number of k's is the number of integers k in [ceil(sqrt(d +1)), d] such that d divides k(k -1), and 1 <= (k^2 -k)/d <= d.

But (k^2 -k)/d <= d => k^2 -k <= d^2.

Which is always true because k <= d, so k^2 <= d^2, so k^2 -k <= d^2 since k >=1.

So, the upper condition is automatically satisfied.

Therefore, for each d, the number of k's is equal to the number of integers k in [ceil(sqrt(d +1)), d] such that d divides k(k -1).

But how do we compute that?

Wait, for each d, the number of solutions k in [1, d] where d divides k(k-1) is 2^{m}, where m is the number of distinct prime factors of d.

But in our case, k must be in [ceil(sqrt(d +1)), d], so the number is 2^{m} minus the number of solutions in [1, ceil(sqrt(d +1)) -1].

This seems complicated because for each d, we have to compute how many of the 2^{m} solutions are less than ceil(sqrt(d +1)).

Alternatively, perhaps we can find for each d, the number of k's in [ceil(sqrt(d +1)), d] such that d divides k(k -1). 

But without knowing the exact distribution of these k's, it's challenging.

Alternatively, perhaps we can consider that for a given d, the number of k's is equal to the number of k's in [ceil(sqrt(d +1)), d] where k ≡ 0 or 1 mod p for each prime p dividing d. But again, this seems too abstract.

Wait, maybe an alternative approach. Let me think.

We can model the problem as follows: For each d, the number of k's is equal to the number of k in [ceil(sqrt(d +1)), d] such that d divides k(k -1). So, for each d, how many k's satisfy this condition?

But perhaps instead of thinking in terms of k, we can think in terms of multiples.

Given that d divides k(k -1), for each k, either d divides k or d divides k -1. But since d can have multiple prime factors, it's more complicated.

Wait, no. Because if d divides k(k -1), and since k and k -1 are coprime, d must be a product of factors that each divide either k or k -1. So, if d has prime factors, each prime factor must entirely divide k or k -1. Therefore, for each prime p in the factorization of d, p must divide either k or k -1.

This suggests that the number of possible k's is 2^{m}, where m is the number of distinct prime factors of d, because for each prime factor, we have two choices: whether it divides k or k -1. 

But wait, this is only true if d is square-free. If d has higher multiplicities, like d = p^2, then it's more complicated because p^2 must divide either k or k -1. 

So, if d is square-free, the number of k's in [1, d] is 2^{m}, where m is the number of distinct primes. If d is not square-free, then the number is less. For example, if d = p^2, then either p^2 divides k or p^2 divides k -1. So, only two possibilities: k ≡ 0 mod p^2 or k ≡ 1 mod p^2. So, in this case, the number of solutions is 2, regardless of the exponent.

Wait, so whether d is square-free or not, the number of solutions k in [1, d] is 2^{m}, where m is the number of distinct primes in d's prime factorization. Because for each prime, you choose whether it divides k or k -1, but if a prime has a higher power, it's still a single choice for that prime.

Wait, but in the case of d = p^2, the number of solutions is 2, which is 2^{1}, since m=1. So yes, that holds. Similarly, for d = p*q, where p and q are primes, the number of solutions is 2^2=4, as we saw earlier.

Therefore, the number of k's in [1, d] that satisfy d divides k(k -1) is 2^{m}, where m is the number of distinct prime factors of d.

But in our problem, k is in [ceil(sqrt(d +1)), d], not [1, d]. So, we need to subtract the number of solutions in [1, ceil(sqrt(d +1)) -1] from the total number of solutions, which is 2^{m}.

But how many solutions are there in [1, ceil(sqrt(d +1)) -1]?

This depends on d. For small d, say d=6, sqrt(d +1)=sqrt(7)≈2.645, so ceil(sqrt(7))=3. So, in [1,2], how many k's satisfy d divides k(k -1). For d=6, k=1: yes, k=2: 2*1=2, which is not divisible by 6. So only k=1 is in [1,2]. So, total solutions in [1, d]=4, solutions in [1,2]=1, so solutions in [3,6]=3? But earlier when we checked d=6, the solutions were k=1,3,4,6. So in [3,6], that's k=3,4,6: three solutions. So, 4 total, 1 below, 3 in the required range.

So, in this case, the number of k's in the required range is 2^{m} - number of solutions in [1, ceil(sqrt(d +1)) -1].

But how do we compute the number of solutions in [1, t], where t = ceil(sqrt(d +1)) -1.

This seems tricky because for each d, t is different, and we'd have to compute the number of k's <= t that satisfy d divides k(k -1). 

But maybe for the purposes of finding when the number of solutions exceeds ten, we can approximate or find a pattern.

Wait, let's consider that for each d, the number of k's is approximately 2^{m}, where m is the number of distinct prime factors of d. So, to have more than ten k's, we need 2^{m} > 10, which implies m >= 4, since 2^4=16 >10. So, d must have at least four distinct prime factors.

Wait, but is that correct? Because in the case of d=6 (m=2), we had 4 solutions, but some of them were below the required range, leading to 3 solutions in the required k range. So, perhaps not all 2^{m} solutions fall into the k range. Therefore, to have more than ten k's, we might need d to have more than four distinct prime factors, but this is getting a bit fuzzy.

Alternatively, maybe the number of k's is roughly proportional to 2^{m}, so to get more than ten, d needs to have enough prime factors such that 2^{m} is more than ten. So, m >=4, since 2^4=16.

Thus, d must be a number with at least four distinct prime factors.

So, the smallest such d would be the product of the first four primes: 2*3*5*7=210. Therefore, b = d +1 = 211.

But wait, is that the minimal b? Because maybe d can have multiple prime factors, but with exponents, but earlier we saw that exponents don't increase m, the number of distinct primes. So, the minimal d with m=4 is indeed 210.

But let's check for smaller d's. Maybe d=120, which is 2^3*3*5, so m=3. 2^3=8. So, for d=120, the number of solutions in [1,120] is 8. But the number in the required range might be less. For example, sqrt(121)=11, so k must be >=11. So, how many solutions are in [11,120]?

But since the total number of solutions is 8, and some of them might be in [1,10], the number in [11,120] would be 8 minus the number in [1,10]. Let's see for d=120:

The solutions k in [1,120] where d divides k(k-1). Since d=120, which has prime factors 2,3,5.

Each prime factor can be assigned to k or k-1.

So, the solutions are k=1 (since 0 is divisible by any d), and other k's where each prime divides either k or k-1.

But it's complicated to compute.

Alternatively, perhaps the number of k's in [ceil(sqrt(d +1)), d] is roughly 2^{m}, but since we can't be certain, maybe our initial assumption is that d must be highly composite with many small prime factors.

Wait, but perhaps a better approach is to note that for each d, the number of k's is equal to the number of ways to assign each prime factor of d to either k or k-1, which is 2^{m}.

But in reality, some assignments might lead to the same k, so it's not exactly 2^{m}.

Wait, perhaps I can think about it in terms of the multiplicative functions.

Alternatively, perhaps instead of focusing on d, I can think of the number of solutions for a given b.

Wait, perhaps I can write a small program to iterate through b starting from 2 upwards, and for each b, compute the number of k's that satisfy the conditions, and find the minimal b where this number exceeds 10.

But since I'm doing this manually, let's try to think of it step by step.

Let me consider that for a given b, d = b -1.

The number of k's is equal to the number of integers k in [ceil(sqrt(b)), b -1] such that d divides k(k -1).

But for d to have a high number of k's, it must have many divisors, which would happen when d is highly composite.

So, perhaps the minimal b is such that d is a highly composite number with many small prime factors.

The highly composite numbers are numbers like 1, 2, 4, 6, 12, 24, 36, 48, 60, 120, etc.

Let's check for d=60.

d=60, which is 2^2 * 3 *5. So, m=3, so 2^3=8 solutions in [1,60]. So, the number of solutions in [ceil(sqrt(61)),60] is 8 minus the number of solutions in [1,7].

Wait, sqrt(61)≈7.81, so ceil is 8.

So, in [8,60], how many solutions?

We need to count the number of k's in [8,60] where 60 divides k(k-1).

But 60 divides k(k-1) implies that 4,3,5 divide k(k-1).

Since 4,3,5 are pairwise coprime, k(k-1) must be divisible by 4,3,5.

So, either k or k-1 must be divisible by 4, and similarly for 3 and 5.

So, for k in [8,60], how many satisfy that k ≡0 or 1 mod 4, mod 3, mod5.

This seems like a Chinese Remainder Theorem problem.

The number of solutions is 2^3=8 in [1,60], as before.

But how many of these are in [8,60]?

Well, in [1,60], the solutions are:

k=1 (since 0 is allowed)
k=5 (since 5*4=20, which is divisible by 4,5)
Wait, no, wait: 60 divides k(k-1). So, for k=5: 5*4=20. 20 is not divisible by 60. So, perhaps k=5 is not a solution.

Wait, perhaps I should list all k's in [1,60] where 60 divides k(k-1).

But this is time-consuming. Alternatively, perhaps for k in [1,60], the number of solutions is 8, as per 2^3.

So, in [1,60], there are 8 k's. Now, how many of these are below 8?

k=1: yes
k=4: 4*3=12, 12 is not divisible by 60. So, no.
k=5: 5*4=20: no
k= 15: 15*14=210: 210 mod60=30: no
Wait, perhaps it's better to think in terms of the CRT.

Wait, the solutions are the numbers k ≡0 or 1 mod 4, 0 or 1 mod3, and 0 or 1 mod5.

So, each combination gives a unique solution modulo 4*3*5=60.

Total combinations: 2*2*2=8, so 8 solutions in [1,60].

So, the solutions are:

1. k ≡0 mod4, 0 mod3, 0 mod5: k=0 mod60. So, k=60 is one solution.

2. k ≡0 mod4, 0 mod3, 1 mod5: solve k ≡0 mod12, k≡1 mod5. The solution is k=24.

3. k ≡0 mod4,1 mod3,0 mod5: solve k≡0 mod4, k≡1 mod3, k≡0 mod5.

Find k ≡0 mod20, and k≡1 mod3. So 20≡2 mod3, so 20x ≡1 mod3 => x≡2 mod3. So x=2, so k=40.

4. k≡0 mod4,1 mod3,1 mod5: solve k≡0 mod4, k≡1 mod3, k≡1 mod5.

Find k ≡? mod60.

We can solve this step by step.

k ≡1 mod3 and k≡1 mod5 implies k≡1 mod15.

So k ≡0 mod4 and k≡1 mod15.

So, find x such that x ≡0 mod4, x≡1 mod15.

Let x=15m +1.

15m +1 ≡0 mod4 => 15m ≡-1 mod4 => 15≡3 mod4, so 3m ≡-1 ≡3 mod4 => m ≡1 mod4.

So m=4n +1.

Thus, x=15*(4n +1)+1=60n +16.

So, the smallest solution is k=16, then 76, etc. But since we're in [1,60], k=16.

5. k≡1 mod4,0 mod3,0 mod5: solve k≡1 mod4, k≡0 mod3, k≡0 mod5.

So, k must be divisible by 15, and k≡1 mod4.

Find k=15m, 15m≡1 mod4. 15≡3 mod4, so 3m≡1 mod4 => m≡3 mod4.

So m=4n +3.

Thus, k=15*(4n +3)=60n +45. In [1,60], k=45.

6. k≡1 mod4,0 mod3,1 mod5: solve k≡1 mod4, k≡0 mod3, k≡1 mod5.

Find k ≡0 mod3, k≡1 mod4, k≡1 mod5.

First, solve k≡1 mod4 and k≡1 mod5.

k ≡1 mod LCM(4,5)=20. So k=20m +1.

Now, this must be ≡0 mod3.

20m +1 ≡0 mod3 => 20≡2 mod3, so 2m +1 ≡0 mod3 => 2m≡2 mod3 => m≡1 mod3.

Thus, m=3n +1.

So, k=20*(3n +1)+1=60n +21. In [1,60], k=21.

7. k≡1 mod4,1 mod3,0 mod5: solve k≡1 mod4, k≡1 mod3, k≡0 mod5.

First, solve k≡1 mod4 and k≡1 mod3.

The LCM of 4 and3 is12. So, k≡1 mod12.

Then, k≡0 mod5.

Find k=12m +1, which is ≡0 mod5.

12m +1≡0 mod5 => 12m ≡-1 mod5 => 12≡2 mod5, so 2m≡4 mod5 => m≡2 mod5.

Thus, m=5n +2.

So, k=12*(5n +2)+1=60n +25. In [1,60], k=25.

8. k≡1 mod4,1 mod3,1 mod5: solve k≡1 mod4, k≡1 mod3, k≡1 mod5.

So, k≡1 mod LCM(4,3,5)=60. So, k=1,61, etc. But in [1,60], only k=1.

So, the solutions in [1,60] are k=1,16,21,25,45,60, and any others I might have missed.

Wait, let me list them:

1. k=1
2. k=16
3. k=21
4. k=25
5. k=45
6. k=60

Wait, that's six solutions. But earlier, we thought there should be 8. Did I miss two?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the combinations. Let me recount.

The 8 solutions would be:

1. All 0's: k=0 mod4, 0 mod3, 0 mod5: k=0, but since we're in positive integers, k=60.

2. 0 mod4, 0 mod3, 1 mod5: k=24

3. 0 mod4,1 mod3,0 mod5: k=40

4. 0 mod4,1 mod3,1 mod5: k=16

5. 1 mod4,0 mod3,0 mod5: k=45

6. 1 mod4,0 mod3,1 mod5: k=21

7. 1 mod4,1 mod3,0 mod5: k=25

8. 1 mod4,1 mod3,1 mod5: k=1

So, in [1,60], the solutions are k=1,16,21,25,24,40,45,60.

So, that's eight solutions. Now, how many of these are >=8?

k=1: <8: no
k=16: yes
k=21: yes
k=25: yes
k=24: yes
k=40: yes
k=45: yes
k=60: yes

So, in [8,60], the number of solutions is 7 (k=16,21,24,25,40,45,60). 

Therefore, for d=60 (b=61), the number of k's is 7.

So, 7 is less than 10. So, b=61 is not sufficient.

Wait, but earlier I thought that for d=60, the number of k's in [1,60] is 8, and in [8,60], it's 7.

So, to get more than ten k's, we need a higher d.

Wait, let's try d=120.

d=120, which factors into 2^3*3*5. So, m=3, so 2^3=8 solutions in [1,120].

But let's compute the number in [ceil(sqrt(120 +1)),120] = [ceil(sqrt(121))=11, 120].

So, how many of the 8 solutions are >=11.

We can list the solutions:

The solutions for d=120 are similar, but the modulus is higher.

Wait, rather than listing all, perhaps we can use the same approach as before.

But this is getting too time-consuming. Alternatively, perhaps the number of k's in the required range is approximately 2^{m} - number of small solutions.

But I need a better approach.

Wait, maybe we can model the number of solutions in the range [ceil(sqrt(d +1)), d] as roughly 2^{m} minus the number of solutions in [1, ceil(sqrt(d +1)) -1].

But without knowing how many solutions are in the lower range, it's hard to estimate.

Alternatively, perhaps the minimal b is 211, as I thought earlier, with d=210, which has four distinct prime factors, leading to 2^4=16 solutions. Assuming that in [ceil(sqrt(211)),210], most of these solutions fall into the required range, giving us more than ten.

But let's check for d=210.

d=210, which is 2*3*5*7. So, m=4. So, number of solutions in [1,210] is 2^4=16.

Now, sqrt(211)=~14.526, so ceil is 15. So, we need k's in [15,210].

How many of the 16 solutions are >=15?

Well, in [1,210], the solutions are:

k=1 (from 0 mod all primes)
k=15 (solving 1 mod 2,1 mod3,1 mod5,1 mod7)
Wait, no, perhaps it's better to consider all possible combinations.

But this is getting too involved. Alternatively, perhaps the number of solutions in [15,210] is 16 minus the number of solutions in [1,14].

But without knowing exactly how many solutions are below 15, it's hard to say. Let's assume that in the lower range, say 1-14, there are only a few solutions, maybe 3 or 4. Then, the number in [15,210] would be around 12-13, which is more than ten. Therefore, b=211 would have more than ten b-eautiful numbers.

But perhaps a smaller d would suffice. Let's try d=60, which gives 7 solutions, as above. Not enough.

What about d=30? d=30, which is 2*3*5, m=3, so 8 solutions in [1,30].

sqrt(31)=~5.56, ceil is 6.

So, in [6,30], how many solutions?

Total solutions in [1,30]:8.

Solutions below 6: k=1, perhaps k=5 (but 5*4=20, which is not divisible by 30), so only k=1.

So, in [6,30], 7 solutions. So, b=31 would have 7 solutions, still less than ten.

Next, d=42 (factors 2,3,7; m=3, 8 solutions).

sqrt(43)=~6.55, ceil=7.

Number of solutions in [7,42]: total 8 minus solutions below 7.

Solutions below 7: k=1, and perhaps k=6 (6*5=30, not divisible by 42). So, only k=1.

Thus, 7 solutions in [7,42]. So, b=43 would have 7 solutions.

Still not enough.

Next, d=60 (as before), 7 solutions.

d=120: let's see.

d=120, m=3, so 8 solutions.

sqrt(121)=11.

So, number of solutions in [11,120]: 8 minus number of solutions below 11.

Solutions below 11: k=1, and perhaps k=10 (10*9=90, not divisible by 120), k=9 (9*8=72, not divisible by 120), k=8 (8*7=56, not divisible by 120), k=7 (7*6=42, no), k=6 (6*5=30, no), k=5 (5*4=20, no), k=4 (4*3=12, no), k=3 (3*2=6, no), k=2 (2*1=2, no). So only k=1 is below 11.

Thus, in [11,120], 7 solutions. So, b=121 would have 7 solutions.

Still not enough.

What about d=180: factors 2^2,3^2,5. m=3, so 8 solutions.

sqrt(181)=~13.45, ceil=14.

Number of solutions in [14,180]: 8 minus number of solutions below 14.

Solutions below 14: k=1, and perhaps others.

Check k=10: 10*9=90, which is not divisible by 180 (since 90 <180). k=12: 12*11=132, not divisible by 180. k=15: 15*14=210, which is greater than 180, but 210 is not divisible by 180. Wait, but k must be <=d=180.

Wait, perhaps for d=180, the number of solutions in [1,180] is 8.

So, in [14,180], 8 minus number of solutions <14.

Solutions below 14: k=1, and maybe k=15 is above 14. Wait, no, k=15 is 15, which is >=14.

Wait, perhaps no other solutions below 14 except k=1.

So, in [14,180], 7 solutions. Still not enough.

This suggests that perhaps I need to find a d with m=4, which would give 16 solutions in [1,d]. Then, in the required range [ceil(sqrt(d+1)),d], the number of solutions would be 16 minus the number below ceil(sqrt(d+1)).

Assuming that d is 210, with m=4, sqrt(211)=~14.5, ceil=15.

Number of solutions in [1,210]:16.

Number of solutions below 15: k=1, and maybe others.

Check k=2: 2*1=2, d=210 doesn't divide it.
k=3:3*2=6: no
k=4:12: no
k=5:20: no
k=6:30: no
k=7:42: no
k=8:56: no
k=9:72: no
k=10:90: no
k=11:110: no
k=12:132: no
k=13:13*12=156: no
k=14:14*13=182: no

So, only k=1 is below 15.

Thus, in [15,210], 16-1=15 solutions.

Therefore, for d=210, b=211, the number of k's is 15, which is more than ten.

Is there a smaller d with m=4?

The next smallest d with four distinct prime factors is 2*3*5*7=210. The next would be 2*3*5*11=330, which would give b=331. But 210 is smaller, so b=211 is the minimal b where the number of beautiful numbers exceeds ten.

Wait, but let me confirm if there's a smaller d with m=4.

Wait, 2*3*5*7=210, which is the product of the first four primes. The next would be 2*3*5*7*... but that would have five primes, which is unnecessary. So, 210 is indeed the smallest d with four distinct prime factors.

Therefore, the minimal b is 211.

To solve the problem, we need to find the smallest base \( b \) such that there are more than ten \( b \)-eautiful integers. A number \( n \) is \( b \)-eautiful if it has exactly two digits in base \( b \) and the sum of these digits equals \( \sqrt{n} \).

### Key Steps:

   - A \(

To solve the problem, we need to find the smallest integer \( b \geq 2 \) such that there are more than ten \( b \)-eautiful integers. A number \( n \) is \( b \)-eautiful if it has exactly two digits in base \( b \) and the sum of these digits equals \( \sqrt{n} \).

### Key Steps:

1. **Definition of \( b \)-eautiful Numbers**:
   - A number \( n \) is \( b \)-eautiful if \( n = a \cdot b + c \) where \( a \) and \( c \) are digits in base \( b \), and \( a + c = \sqrt{n} \).
   - \( n \) must be a perfect square, say \( n = k^2 \), leading to \( k^2 = a \cdot b + c \) and \( a + c = k \).

2. **Expression for \( a \)**:
   - Substituting \( c = k - a \) into \( k^2 = a \cdot b + c \) gives \( k^2 = a \cdot (b - 1) + k \).
   - Rearranging, \( a = \frac{k^2 - k}{b - 1} \). For \( a \) to be an integer, \( b - 1 \) must divide \( k^2 - k \).

3. **Conditions on \( k \)**:
   - \( k \) must satisfy \( \lceil \sqrt{b} \rceil \leq k \leq b - 1 \).
   - The number of valid \( k \) values for a given \( b \) depends on the number of divisors of \( k(k - 1) \) that equal \( b - 1 \).

4. **Finding \( b \) with More Than Ten Solutions**:
   - The number of \( k \) values is related to the number of distinct prime factors of \( d = b - 1 \). For each distinct prime factor, there are two possibilities (dividing \( k \) or \( k - 1 \)), leading to \( 2^m \) solutions, where \( m \) is the number of distinct prime factors.
   - To exceed ten solutions, \( 2^m > 10 \), implying \( m \geq 4 \) (since \( 2^4 = 16 \)).

5. **Smallest \( d \) with Four Distinct Prime Factors**:
   - The smallest \( d \) with four distinct prime factors is \( 2 \times 3 \times 5 \times 7 = 210 \).
   - Thus, \( b = d + 1 = 211 \).

### Conclusion:
The smallest base \( b \) for which there are more than ten \( b \)-eautiful integers is \( \boxed{211} \).
