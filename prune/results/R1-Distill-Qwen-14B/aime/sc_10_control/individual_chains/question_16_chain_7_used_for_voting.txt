Okay, so I've got this math problem to solve, and I'm a bit nervous because it seems a bit challenging. Let me read it again to make sure I understand.

The problem says: Let p be the least prime number for which there exists a positive integer n such that n⁴ + 1 is divisible by p². Then, I need to find the least positive integer m such that m⁴ +1 is divisible by p squared. 

Alright, so the first part is to find the smallest prime p where n⁴ +1 is divisible by p² for some n. Then, using that p, find the smallest m where m⁴ +1 is divisible by p squared.

Hmm, okay. Let's break this down step by step.

First, I need to find the smallest prime p such that p² divides n⁴ +1 for some n. So, I should look for primes p where n⁴ ≡ -1 mod p² has a solution. That means that -1 is a quartic residue modulo p². 

Wait, but quartic residues modulo primes... I remember that for primes p, if p ≡ 1 mod 4, then -1 is a quadratic residue. But quartic residues are a bit different. Let me recall that for a prime p, the multiplicative group modulo p is cyclic of order p-1. So, for n⁴ ≡ -1 mod p² to have a solution, -1 must be in the subgroup of quartic residues, which requires the order of -1 in the multiplicative group modulo p² to divide 4. 

Wait, maybe that's a bit too abstract. Let me think more concretely. For a prime p, the equation x⁴ ≡ -1 mod p² must have a solution. So, let's check small primes p one by one and see if such an n exists.

Let me list the primes in order: 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, etc.

Start with p=2. Let me check if there's an n such that n⁴ +1 is divisible by 4. Since n is a positive integer, n can be 1, 2, 3, etc.

n=1: 1⁴ +1 = 2, which isn't divisible by 4.

n=2: 2⁴ +1 = 16 +1=17, which isn't divisible by 4.

Wait, but 17 mod 4 is 1, so nope.

Wait, but 2² is 4, so for p=2, does any n satisfy n⁴ ≡ -1 mod 4? Let's see: n can be 0,1,2,3 mod4.

n=0: 0⁴=0, 0+1=1 mod4, which isn't 0.

n=1: 1+1=2 mod4, nope.

n=2: 16 mod4 is 0, 0+1=1 mod4, nope.

n=3: 81 mod4 is 1, 1+1=2 mod4, nope.

So p=2 doesn't work.

Next, p=3. Let's check if there's an n such that n⁴ ≡ -1 mod9. That is, n⁴ ≡8 mod9.

Compute n⁴ mod9 for n=1 to 8 (since 9 is the modulus, and it's cyclic every 9 numbers).

n=1: 1⁴=1 mod9 → 1≡1≠8.

n=2: 16 mod9 is 7. 7≡7≠8.

n=3: 81≡0 mod9. 0≠8.

n=4: 256 mod9. 256 /9 is 28*9=252, 256-252=4, so 4. 4≡4≠8.

n=5: 625 mod9. Let's compute 625: 6+2+5=13, 13 mod9=4, so 625≡4 mod9. 4≡4≠8.

n=6: 6⁴=1296. 1296/9=144, so 1296≡0 mod9. Not 8.

n=7: 7⁴=2401. 2401 mod9: 2+4+0+1=7, 7 mod9=7. So 7≡7≠8.

n=8: 8⁴=4096. 4096 mod9: sum the digits: 4+0+9+6=19, 19 mod9 is 1. So 1≡1≠8.

So, none of these n from 1 to8 give n⁴≡8 mod9. So p=3 doesn't work either.

Next prime is p=5. Let's check if n⁴ ≡-1 mod25 has a solution. So we need n⁴ ≡24 mod25.

Let me compute n⁴ mod25 for n=1 to 24.

But that seems tedious, maybe there's a smarter way.

Wait, perhaps I can find a quadratic residue first. Since n⁴ = (n²)², so if n⁴ ≡24 mod25, then 24 must be a quadratic residue mod25.

Wait, 24 mod25 is -1. So is -1 a quadratic residue mod25? Let's see. The quadratic residues mod25 can be found by squaring 1 to 12 (since 25 is 5², and the multiplicative group mod25 is cyclic of order 20? Wait, no, the multiplicative group mod25 has order φ(25)=20, so yes.

Wait, but to check if -1 is a quadratic residue mod25. The Legendre symbol (-1|25). Since 25 is 1 mod4, because 25=1 mod4 (25-1=24, which is divisible by 4). So, -1 is a quadratic residue mod25.

Wait, but quadratic residues mod25: Let's see. Let me compute squares mod25:

1²=1

2²=4

3²=9

4²=16

5²=0

6²=36 mod25=11

7²=49 mod25=24

8²=64 mod25=14

9²=81 mod25=6

10²=100 mod25=0

11²=121 mod25=21

12²=144 mod25=19

So, the squares mod25 are: 0,1,4,6,9,11,14,16,19,21,24.

So, 24 is indeed a square mod25 (7²=49≡24). So, -1 is a quadratic residue mod25. But wait, does that mean that 24 is a quartic residue?

Because if 24 is a quadratic residue, then perhaps it's a quartic residue if it's a square of a quadratic residue.

Alternatively, perhaps we can check if there exists an n such that n⁴ ≡24 mod25.

Alternatively, let me try numbers n from 1 to24 and compute n⁴ mod25.

Alternatively, perhaps there's a smarter approach.

But maybe just computing a few n:

n=1: 1⁴=1 mod25.

n=2: 16 mod25.

n=3: 81 mod25=6.

n=4: 256 mod25=6 (since 25*10=250, 256-250=6).

Wait, let me compute n=4: 4²=16, 4⁴= (16)²=256. 256-10*25=256-250=6.

n=5: 625 mod25=0.

n=6: 6²=36 mod25=11, 6⁴=11²=121 mod25=21.

n=7: 7²=49 mod25=24, 7⁴=24²=576 mod25=576-23*25=576-575=1.

n=7: 7⁴=1 mod25.

n=8: 8²=64 mod25=14, 8⁴=14²=196 mod25=196-7*25=196-175=21.

n=9: 9²=81 mod25=6, 9⁴=6²=36 mod25=11.

n=10: 10⁴=0 mod25.

n=11: 11²=121 mod25=21. 11⁴=21²=441 mod25=441-17*25=441-425=16.

n=12: 12²=144 mod25=19. 12⁴=19²=361 mod25=361-14*25=361-350=11.

n=13: Let's compute 13 mod25 is 13. 13²=169 mod25=19. 13⁴=19²=361 mod25=11.

Wait, same as 12⁴.

n=14: 14²=196 mod25=21. 14⁴=21²=441 mod25=16.

n=15: 15⁴=0 mod25.

n=16: 16²=256 mod25=6. 16⁴=6²=36 mod25=11.

n=17: 17²=289 mod25=14. 17⁴=14²=196 mod25=21.

n=18: 18²=324 mod25=24 (since 25*12=300, 324-300=24). 18⁴=24²=576 mod25=1.

n=19: 19²=361 mod25=11. 19⁴=11²=121 mod25=21.

n=20: 20⁴=0 mod25.

n=21: 21²=441 mod25=16. 21⁴=16²=256 mod25=6.

n=22: 22²=484 mod25=9 (484-19*25=484-475=9). 22⁴=9²=81 mod25=6.

n=23: 23²=529 mod25=4 (529-21*25=529-525=4). 23⁴=4²=16 mod25.

n=24: 24²=576 mod25=1. 24⁴=1²=1 mod25.

Hmm, so looking through these, n⁴ mod25 gives: 1,16,6,6,0,21,1,21,11,0,16,11,11,21,0,11,21,0,16,6,6,16,1.

Wait, I don't see any n where n⁴ ≡24 mod25. So p=5 doesn't work either.

Hmm, okay, moving on to p=7.

So, we need to find if there exists an n such that n⁴ ≡-1 mod49, which is n⁴≡48 mod49.

Let me check if n⁴=48 mod49 has a solution.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to check if -1 is a quartic residue mod 7²=49.

Alternatively, let's consider the multiplicative group mod49, which is cyclic of order φ(49)=42. So, the group is cyclic of order 42. For -1 to be a quartic residue, the order of -1 must divide 4. Wait, but the order of -1 in the multiplicative group mod49 is... Let's compute.

But wait, the multiplicative group mod49 is cyclic of order 42, so the element -1 is an element of order 2, since (-1)^2 =1 mod49.

Wait, but if the order of -1 is 2, then for it to be a quartic residue, 2 must divide the order of the group divided by 4, but I'm getting a bit tangled here.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to compute n⁴ mod49 for some n and see if any of them equal 48.

Let me try some small n.

n=1:1⁴=1 mod49.

n=2:16.

n=3:81 mod49=81-49=32.

n=4:256 mod49. 49*5=245, 256-245=11.

n=5:625 mod49. Let's compute 49*12=588, 625-588=37.

n=6:1296 mod49. 49*26=1274, 1296-1274=22.

n=7:7⁴=2401 mod49=0.

n=8:8⁴=4096 mod49. Let's compute 49*83=49*80=3920, 49*3=147, so 3920+147=4067. 4096-4067=29.

n=9:9⁴=6561 mod49. Let's compute 49*133=49*(130+3)=49*130=6370, 49*3=147, so 6370+147=6517. 6561-6517=44.

n=10:10⁴=10000 mod49. 49*204=9996, so 10000-9996=4. So 10⁴=4 mod49.

n=11:11⁴=14641 mod49. Let me compute 49*298=49*(300-2)=49*300=14700, minus 49*2=98 →14700-98=14602. 14641-14602=39.

n=12:12⁴=20736 mod49. Let's compute 49*423=49*(400+23)=49*400=19600, 49*23=1127. So 19600+1127=20727. 20736-20727=9.

n=13:13⁴=28561 mod49. Let me compute 49*582=49*(500+80+2)=49*500=24500, 49*80=3920, 49*2=98. So total is 24500+3920=28420+98=28518. 28561-28518=43.

n=14:14⁴=0 mod49.

n=15:15⁴=50625. Let's compute 49*1033=49*(1000+33)=49*1000=49000, 49*33=1617. 49000+1617=50617. 50625-50617=8.

n=16:16⁴=65536 mod49. Let me compute 49*1337=49*(1300+37)=49*1300=63700, 49*37=1813. So 63700+1813=65513. 65536-65513=23.

n=17:17⁴=83521 mod49. Let me compute 49*1704=49*(1700+4)=49*1700=83300, 49*4=196. 83300+196=83496. 83521-83496=25.

n=18:18⁴=104976 mod49. Let me compute 49*2142=49*(2000+142)=49*2000=98000, 49*142=49*(100+40+2)=4900+1960+98=7058. So 98000+7058=105058. 104976-105058= -82 → but mod49, add 49 until positive: -82 + 2*49= -82+98=16.

So n=18⁴=16 mod49.

n=19:19²=361 mod49. 361 mod49: 49*7=343, 361-343=18. So 19²=18 mod49. So 19⁴=(18)²=324 mod49. 324/49=6*49=294, 324-294=30. So 19⁴=30 mod49.

n=20:20²=400 mod49. 49*8=392, 400-392=8 mod49. So 20⁴=8²=64 mod49=15.

n=21:21⁴=0 mod49.

n=22:22²=484 mod49. Let's compute 49*9=441, 484-441=43. So 22²=43, and 22⁴=43²=1849 mod49. Let's compute 49*37=1813, 1849-1813=36.

n=23:23²=529 mod49. Let's compute 49*10=490, 529-490=39. So 23²=39, then 23⁴=39²=1521 mod49. 49*31=1519, 1521-1519=2.

n=24:24²=576 mod49. 49*11=539, 576-539=37. So 24²=37, then 24⁴=37²=1369 mod49. 49*27=1323, 1369-1323=46.

n=25:25²=625 mod49. 49*12=588, 625-588=37. 25⁴=37²=1369 mod49=46.

n=26:26²=676 mod49. 49*13=637, 676-637=39. So 26²=39, 26⁴=39²=1521 mod49=2.

n=27:27²=729 mod49. 49*14=686, 729-686=43. So 27²=43, 27⁴=43²=1849 mod49=36.

n=28:28⁴=0 mod49.

n=29:29 mod49 is 29. 29²=841 mod49. 49*17=833, 841-833=8. So 29²=8, 29⁴=8²=64 mod49=15.

n=30:30²=900 mod49. 49*18=882, 900-882=18. So 30²=18, 30⁴=18²=324 mod49=30.

n=31:31²=961 mod49. 49*19=931, 961-931=30. 31⁴=30²=900 mod49=18.

n=32:32²=1024 mod49. 49*20=980, 1024-980=44. So 32²=44, 32⁴=44²=1936 mod49. Let's compute 49*39=1911, 1936-1911=25.

n=33:33²=1089 mod49. 49*22=1078, 1089-1078=11. So 33²=11, 33⁴=11²=121 mod49=21.

n=34:34²=1156 mod49. 49*23=1127, 1156-1127=29. So 34²=29, 34⁴=29²=841 mod49=8.

n=35:35⁴=0 mod49.

n=36:36²=1296 mod49. 49*26=1274, 1296-1274=22. So 36²=22, 36⁴=22²=484 mod49=43.

n=37:37²=1369 mod49. 49*27=1323, 1369-1323=46. So 37²=46, 37⁴=46²=2116 mod49. 49*43=2107, 2116-2107=9.

n=38:38²=1444 mod49. Let's compute 49*29=1421, 1444-1421=23. So 38²=23, 38⁴=23²=529 mod49=43.

n=39:39²=1521 mod49. 49*31=1519, 1521-1519=2. So 39²=2, 39⁴=2²=4 mod49.

n=40:40²=1600 mod49. 49*32=1568, 1600-1568=32. So 40²=32, 40⁴=32²=1024 mod49=44.

n=41:41²=1681 mod49. 49*34=1666, 1681-1666=15. So 41²=15, 41⁴=15²=225 mod49=225-4*49=225-196=29.

n=42:42²=1764 mod49. 49*35=1715, 1764-1715=49, which is 0 mod49.

n=43:43²=1849 mod49. 49*37=1813, 1849-1813=36. So 43²=36, 43⁴=36²=1296 mod49=22.

n=44:44²=1936 mod49. 49*39=1911, 1936-1911=25. So 44²=25, 44⁴=25²=625 mod49=625-12*49=625-588=37.

n=45:45²=2025 mod49. 49*41=2009, 2025-2009=16. So 45²=16, 45⁴=16²=256 mod49=256-5*49=256-245=11.

n=46:46²=2116 mod49. 49*43=2107, 2116-2107=9. So 46²=9, 46⁴=9²=81 mod49=32.

n=47:47²=2209 mod49. 49*45=2205, 2209-2205=4. So 47²=4, 47⁴=4²=16 mod49.

n=48:48²=2304 mod49. Let's compute 49*47=2303, 2304-2303=1. So 48²=1, 48⁴=1²=1 mod49.

n=49:49⁴=0 mod49.

Wait, so after all that, I don't see any n where n⁴ mod49=48. So p=7 doesn't work either.

Hmm, moving on to p=13? Wait, let me check p=7. Maybe I made a mistake earlier? Because that seems a lot of computation and maybe I missed something.

Alternatively, perhaps I should think about the conditions under which n⁴ ≡-1 mod p² has a solution.

I remember that for a prime p, if p ≡1 mod8, then 2 is a quadratic residue, and higher residues might exist.

Wait, alternatively, perhaps the prime p must be such that the multiplicative order of n modulo p² allows n⁴ ≡-1 mod p².

Wait, another thought: For n⁴ ≡-1 mod p², then n^8 ≡1 mod p². So the multiplicative order of n modulo p² divides 8, but since n^4 ≡-1, the order doesn't divide 4, so the order is 8. Therefore, 8 must divide the order of the multiplicative group modulo p², which is φ(p²)=p(p-1). Therefore, for p≠2, φ(p²)=p(p-1), so 8 divides p(p-1). Since p is an odd prime, p must be 1 mod8 or p-1 must be divisible by 8. So p ≡1 mod8 or p≡1 mod2 (which is always true) but to have 8 dividing p(p-1), either p ≡1 mod8 or p-1≡0 mod8, i.e., p≡1 mod8 or p≡1 mod8? Wait, no. Wait, if p is an odd prime, p is odd, so p-1 is even. For 8 to divide p(p-1), since p is odd, p must be 1 mod8, because p is coprime to 8. Wait, 8 divides p(p-1). Since p is odd, p and 8 are coprime, so 8 must divide (p-1). So p ≡1 mod8.

Therefore, the primes p where p≡1 mod8 may be candidates. So the smallest primes p where p≡1 mod8 are 17, 97, etc. Wait, wait, no. Wait, 17 is 1 mod16, but 17 mod8 is 1. So 17 is the next prime after 2,3,5,7,11,13. Wait, let's check: 17 is 1 mod8? 17-1=16, which is 0 mod8. So yes, 17 is 1 mod8.

Wait, but before that, p=13: 13 mod8 is 5, which is not 1. So 17 is the first prime after 2,3,5,7,11,13 that is 1 mod8.

But wait, let's make sure. 17 is 1 mod8, yes. So perhaps p=17 is the smallest prime for which n⁴ +1 is divisible by p² for some n.

Wait, but wait: Earlier, for p=2,3,5,7, I found that there's no solution. So perhaps p=17 is the least prime where this is possible.

Wait, but let me check p=13. Because maybe I was too quick to assume that p needs to be 1 mod8. Maybe I should check if p=13 allows n⁴ ≡-1 mod169.

Wait, 13 is not 1 mod8, it's 5 mod8. So according to my earlier reasoning, p=13 wouldn't satisfy 8 dividing p(p-1), since p=13, p-1=12, which is 4 mod8. So 8 doesn't divide 13*12=156, since 156/8=19.5, which is not an integer. So p=13 is out.

So, the next candidate is p=17, which is 1 mod8.

So, perhaps p=17 is the least prime where n⁴ ≡-1 mod17²=289 has a solution.

Let me check for p=17.

So, I need to find whether there exists an n such that n⁴ ≡-1 mod289.

Alternatively, perhaps I can compute n⁴ mod289 for some n and see if it's 288.

Wait, but that seems time-consuming. Maybe a smarter approach is needed.

Alternatively, perhaps I can find a solution to n² ≡ something mod17, and then lift it to mod289 using Hensel's lemma.

Wait, because if n⁴ ≡-1 mod17, and then we can find a solution mod17².

Let me first check if there's a solution mod17 for n⁴ ≡-1 mod17.

Since 17 is prime, the multiplicative group mod17 is cyclic of order 16. So, the equation n⁴ ≡-1 mod17. Let's see if this has a solution.

Compute n⁴ mod17 for n=1 to 16.

n=1:1⁴=1.

n=2:16 mod17=16.

n=3:81 mod17=81-4*17=81-68=13.

n=4:256 mod17. 17*15=255, so 256 mod17=1.

n=5:625 mod17. 17*36=612, 625-612=13.

n=6:1296 mod17. Let me compute 17*76=1292, 1296-1292=4.

n=7:2401 mod17. 17*141=2397, 2401-2397=4.

n=8:4096 mod17. Let's compute 17*241=4097, so 4096 mod17=4096-4097= -1 ≡16 mod17.

Wait, 8⁴=4096, which is 4096 mod17.

Wait, 17*241=4097, so 4096=4097-1, so 4096 mod17= -1 mod17=16 mod17.

So n=8 gives 8⁴=16≡-1 mod17.

Great! So n=8 is a solution mod17. Now, can we lift this solution to mod289=17²?

Yes, using Hensel's lemma. Since the derivative of f(n)=n⁴ +1 is f’(n)=4n³. At n=8 mod17, f’(8)=4*(8)³ mod17.

Compute 8³ mod17: 8*8=64 mod17=13, 13*8=104 mod17=104-6*17=104-102=2. So 8³≡2 mod17. So f’(8)=4*2=8 mod17.

Since 8 and 17 are coprime, the derivative is non-zero mod17, so Hensel's lemma applies, and there's a unique lift of the root mod17².

So, let's find n =8 +17k such that n⁴ ≡ -1 mod289.

Compute n=8 +17k.

Let me compute n⁴ = (8 +17k)⁴ mod289.

Expanding using binomial theorem up to terms divisible by 17²:

(8 +17k)⁴ = 8⁴ + 4*8³*(17k) + 6*8²*(17k)² + 4*8*(17k)³ + (17k)^4.

But since we're working mod289=17², any term with 17² or higher power will be 0 mod289. So, we can ignore terms beyond the second order.

So, (8 +17k)^4 ≈8⁴ + 4*8³*(17k) + 6*8²*(17k)^2.

But (17k)^2=289k²≡0 mod289, so the term 6*8²*(17k)^2 is 0 mod289.

Similarly, 4*8³*(17k) =4*8³*17k=4*512*17k, but modulo289, which is 17², any multiple of 17² is 0. Wait, but 4*8³ is 4*512=2048. So, 2048 mod289: Let's compute 289*7=2023, 2048-2023=25. So 4*8³=25 mod289. So, 4*8³*(17k) =25*17k=425k. Now, 425 mod289: 289*1=289, 425-289=136. So 425k ≡136k mod289.

Wait, but 425k=289k + 136k, so mod289, it's 136k.

So, (8 +17k)^4 ≈8⁴ +136k mod289.

But 8⁴ mod289 is 4096 mod289. Let's compute 289*14=4046, 4096-4046=50. So 8⁴ ≡50 mod289.

So, (8 +17k)^4 ≈50 +136k mod289.

We want (8 +17k)^4 ≡-1 mod289. So, 50 +136k ≡-1 mod289.

Which implies 136k ≡-51 mod289.

Simplify: 136k ≡238 mod289 (since -51=238 mod289).

Let me compute gcd(136,289). 289=17²=289, 136=17*8. So gcd is 17.

So, 136k ≡238 mod289.

Divide both sides by 17: 8k ≡14 mod17.

Because 238 ÷17=14, and 289 ÷17=17.

So, 8k ≡14 mod17.

We can solve for k: Multiply both sides by the inverse of 8 mod17.

The inverse of 8 mod17: find x such that 8x≡1 mod17.

Testing x=?

8*2=16≡-1 mod17

8*15=120≡120-7*17=120-119=1 mod17. So inverse is 15.

So, k ≡14 *15 mod17.

14*15=210. 210 ÷17=12*17=204, 210-204=6. So k≡6 mod17.

So, k=6 +17m, where m is an integer.

So, n=8 +17k=8 +17*(6 +17m)=8 +102 +289m=110 +289m.

So, n=110 mod289 is a solution.

Wait, but 110 is greater than 289/2, but maybe the minimal positive integer is 110. But let me check.

Wait, perhaps there's a smaller positive integer. Let me check n=110 mod289. But 110 is less than 289, so that's our minimal solution.

Wait, but let me check 110⁴ +1 mod289.

Compute 110 mod289 is 110.

Compute 110²=12100 mod289.

Compute 289*41=289*(40+1)=11560 +289=11849. 12100-11849=251.

So, 110²=251 mod289.

Then, 110⁴=(251)^2 mod289.

Compute 251²=63001.

Compute 289*217=289*(200+17)=289*200=57800, 289*17=4913. So 57800+4913=62713.

63001 -62713=288.

So, 251²=288 mod289, which is -1 mod289.

Thus, 110⁴=288 mod289, so 110⁴ +1=289≡0 mod289.

So, yes, n=110 is a solution.

But wait, the problem is to find the least positive integer m such that m⁴ +1 is divisible by p². So, m=110.

But wait, 110 is correct? Let me think if there's a smaller m.

Wait, when I solved for k, I found k=6 mod17, which gives n=8+17*6=8+102=110.

But perhaps there's a smaller positive integer less than 110 that also satisfies the condition.

Alternatively, perhaps 110 is indeed the smallest.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in my calculations. Let me try a smaller k.

Wait, when I solved for k in 8k≡14 mod17, I found k=6 mod17, which is the smallest positive solution. So, k=6, giving n=8+17*6=110.

So, 110 is the minimal positive integer m such that m⁴ +1 is divisible by 17²=289.

So, putting it all together, the least prime p is 17, and the minimal m is 110.

Wait, but the problem says to find the least prime p, then find the minimal m for that p. So, in this case, p=17, m=110.

Wait, but let me make sure that 110 is indeed the minimal m. Let me check if any smaller m satisfies m⁴ ≡-1 mod289.

Let me check m=34: 34 mod289=34.

34²=1156 mod289. 289*4=1156, so 34²=0 mod289. So 34⁴=0 mod289. Not -1.

m=51: 51²=2601 mod289. 289*8=2312, 2601-2312=289. 51²=289 mod289=0. So 51⁴=0 mod289.

m=68: 68²=4624 mod289. 289*16=4624, so 68²=0 mod289. 68⁴=0.

m=85: 85²=7225 mod289. 289*25=7225, so 85²=0 mod289.

m=102: 102²=10404 mod289. Let's compute 289*35=10115, 10404-10115=289, so 102²=289 mod289=0. So 102⁴=0 mod289.

m=110: as before, 110⁴=288≡-1 mod289.

So, 110 is the smallest positive integer m where m⁴ +1 is divisible by 289.

Thus, the answer is m=110.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To solve the problem, we need to find the smallest prime \( p \) such that there exists a positive integer \( n \) where \( n^4 + 1 \) is divisible by \( p^2 \). Then, we determine the smallest positive integer \( m \) for which \( m^4 + 1 \) is divisible by \( p^2 \).

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Identifying the Prime \( p \):**
   - We start by checking small primes to see if \( n^4 \equiv -1 \mod p^2 \) has a solution.
   - For \( p = 2, 3, 5, 7 \), no solutions exist as verified by direct computation.
   - Next, we consider primes where \( p \equiv 1 \mod 8 \) since such primes are candidates for \( n^4 \equiv -1 \mod p^2 \) to have a solution.
   - The smallest prime \( p \) satisfying \( p \equiv 1 \mod 8 \) is \( p = 17 \).

2. **Finding \( n \) for \( p = 17 \):**
   - We first solve \( n^4 \equiv -1 \mod 17 \). By testing values, we find \( n = 8 \) satisfies this congruence.
   - Using Hensel's Lemma, we lift this solution to modulo \( 17^2 = 289 \). Let \( n = 8 + 17k \). Expanding \( (8 + 17k)^4 \) and simplifying modulo \( 289 \), we solve for \( k \) and find \( k = 6 \).
   - Thus, \( n = 8 + 17 \times 6 = 110 \) is a solution to \( n^4 \equiv -1 \mod 289 \).

3. **Verifying \( m = 110 \):**
   - We confirm that \( 110^4 + 1 \) is indeed divisible by \( 289 \) through direct computation.

### Conclusion:
The least prime \( p \) is \( 17 \), and the smallest positive integer \( m \) such that \( m^4 + 1 \) is divisible by \( 17^2 \) is \( 110 \).

\boxed{110}
