Okay, so I have this problem here: I need to find the largest possible real part of the expression (75 + 117i)z + (96 + 144i)/z, where z is a complex number with |z| = 4. Hmm, that seems a bit involved, but let me think about how to approach it.

First, I remember that for complex numbers, if you have |z| = r, then z can be represented as r*e^{iθ}, where θ is the argument of z. Since |z| = 4 here, z can be written as 4e^{iθ}. That might be helpful.

So, perhaps I can substitute z with 4e^{iθ} in the expression. Let me write that down:

Expression = (75 + 117i)(4e^{iθ}) + (96 + 144i)/(4e^{iθ})

Simplify each term separately.

First term: (75 + 117i)*4e^{iθ} = 4*(75 + 117i)*e^{iθ}

Second term: (96 + 144i)/(4e^{iθ}) = (96 + 144i)/4 * e^{-iθ} = (24 + 36i)e^{-iθ}

So, the expression becomes:

4*(75 + 117i)*e^{iθ} + (24 + 36i)*e^{-iθ}

Hmm, now, to find the real part of this expression, I can expand each term into real and imaginary parts.

But wait, perhaps it's better to express everything in terms of cosθ and sinθ, since e^{iθ} = cosθ + i sinθ and e^{-iθ} = cosθ - i sinθ.

Let me denote A = 75 + 117i and B = 24 + 36i. So the expression is 4A e^{iθ} + B e^{-iθ}.

Expanding each term:

4A e^{iθ} = 4A (cosθ + i sinθ) = 4A cosθ + 4i A sinθ

B e^{-iθ} = B (cosθ - i sinθ) = B cosθ - i B sinθ

Adding them together:

Real parts: 4A cosθ + B cosθ = cosθ (4A + B)

Imaginary parts: 4A sinθ - B sinθ = sinθ (4A - B)

Wait, but actually A and B are complex numbers, so I can't just factor out like that directly. I need to compute the real and imaginary components correctly.

Wait, maybe I should represent A and B as complex numbers in terms of their real and imaginary parts.

Let me denote A = a + ib, where a =75, b=117

Similarly, B = c + id, where c=24, d=36

So, 4A e^{iθ} = 4(a + ib)(cosθ + i sinθ) = 4 [a cosθ - b sinθ + i (a sinθ + b cosθ)]

Similarly, B e^{-iθ} = (c + id)(cosθ - i sinθ) = [c cosθ + d sinθ + i (-c sinθ + d cosθ)]

So combining these:

Real parts:

4(a cosθ - b sinθ) + (c cosθ + d sinθ)

Imaginary parts:

4(a sinθ + b cosθ) + (-c sinθ + d cosθ)

But since we're only interested in the real part, we can focus on the real terms:

Real part = 4(a cosθ - b sinθ) + (c cosθ + d sinθ)

Let me plug in the values:

a =75, b=117, c=24, d=36

So,

Real part = 4*(75 cosθ - 117 sinθ) + (24 cosθ + 36 sinθ)

Simplify this:

= (4*75) cosθ - (4*117) sinθ + 24 cosθ + 36 sinθ

Calculate the coefficients:

4*75 = 300, 4*117 = 468

So,

= 300 cosθ - 468 sinθ + 24 cosθ + 36 sinθ

Combine like terms:

(300 + 24) cosθ + (-468 + 36) sinθ

324 cosθ - 432 sinθ

So, Real part = 324 cosθ - 432 sinθ

Now, I need to find the maximum value of this expression with respect to θ.

I remember that for expressions of the form K cosθ + M sinθ, the maximum value is sqrt(K^2 + M^2). So, perhaps I can factor this expression as R cos(θ + φ), where R is sqrt(324^2 + (-432)^2).

Wait, but wait, in my case, it is 324 cosθ - 432 sinθ, which is equivalent to K cosθ + M sinθ, where K=324, M=-432.

So, the maximum value will be sqrt(K^2 + M^2) = sqrt(324^2 + 432^2).

Let me compute that.

First, let's compute 324^2 and 432^2.

324 = 18^2 * 1. So, 324^2 = (18^2)^2 * 1^2 = 18^4 = 104976. Wait, wait, no. 18^2 is 324, so 324^2 is (324)^2.

Let me compute it:

324 * 324: 300*300=90000, 300*24=7200, 24*300=7200, 24*24=576. So, 90000 + 7200 +7200 +576 = 90000+14400=104400 +576=104976.

Similarly, 432^2: 400^2=160000, 32^2=1024, and cross terms: 2*400*32=25600. So, (400+32)^2=432^2=400^2 + 2*400*32 +32^2=160000 +25600 +1024=160000+25600=185600 +1024=186624.

So, sqrt(104976 + 186624) = sqrt(291600). Hmm, sqrt(291600). What's that?

Since 540^2 = 291600 (because 500^2=250000, 540^2=500^2 + 2*500*40 +40^2=250000 +40000 +1600=291600).

So the maximum value is 540.

Wait, but wait. Let me double-check. So, Real part = 324 cosθ -432 sinθ, which can be written as 324 cosθ + (-432) sinθ.

So, the amplitude is sqrt(324^2 + 432^2) = sqrt(104976 + 186624) = sqrt(291600)=540. So the maximum real part is 540.

Wait, but I thought that the maximum of K cosθ + M sinθ is sqrt(K^2 + M^2). So, yes, that's correct. So the maximum real part is 540.

Therefore, the largest possible real part is 540.

Wait, but let me think again about the steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake.

So, starting with the expression:

(75 + 117i) z + (96 + 144i)/z, |z|=4.

Expressed z as 4e^{iθ}, so the expression becomes:

(75 + 117i)*4e^{iθ} + (96 + 144i)/(4e^{iθ})

Simplify each term, which gave:

4*(75 +117i)e^{iθ} + (24 + 36i)e^{-iθ}

Then, expanded each term into real and imaginary parts, focusing on the real parts.

Computed the real part as 324 cosθ -432 sinθ.

Then, used the formula for maximum of K cosθ + M sinθ, which is sqrt(K^2 + M^2), and got 540.

Wait, but let me check if I correctly expanded the real parts.

When I expanded 4A e^{iθ}, A=75+117i:

4A = 4*(75 + 117i) = 300 + 468i

So, 4A e^{iθ} = (300 + 468i)(cosθ + i sinθ) = 300 cosθ + 300 i sinθ + 468i cosθ -468 sinθ.

So, the real part is 300 cosθ -468 sinθ.

Similarly, B e^{-iθ} where B=24+36i:

(24 +36i)(cosθ -i sinθ) = 24 cosθ +24 (-i sinθ) +36i cosθ -36i^2 sinθ.

Simplify:

=24 cosθ -24i sinθ +36i cosθ +36 sinθ.

So, the real part is 24 cosθ +36 sinθ.

Therefore, when adding the real parts:

From 4A e^{iθ}: 300 cosθ -468 sinθ

From B e^{-iθ}:24 cosθ +36 sinθ

Total real part: (300 +24) cosθ + (-468 +36) sinθ =324 cosθ -432 sinθ.

Yes, that's correct.

So, that part is correct. So, the maximum value is sqrt(324^2 +432^2) =540.

But wait, is that correct? Because sometimes when dealing with complex numbers, especially with products and divisions, there's a possibility of making a mistake in the expansion.

Let me check the initial substitution again.

z =4e^{iθ}, so 1/z = (1/4) e^{-iθ}.

So, (75 +117i) z = (75 +117i)*4e^{iθ} =4*(75 +117i) e^{iθ}

(96 +144i)/z = (96 +144i) * (1/(4 e^{iθ})) = (24 +36i) e^{-iθ}

Yes, that's correct.

So, the expression becomes 4*(75 + 117i) e^{iθ} + (24 +36i) e^{-iθ}

Which is same as 4A e^{iθ} + B e^{-iθ}, where A=75+117i, B=24+36i.

So, when expanded, as before, the real part is 324 cosθ -432 sinθ.

So, maximum is 540.

But wait, let me also think about whether this is achievable, i.e., is there a θ such that cosθ and sinθ align to give this maximum. Because sometimes, when you have complex expressions, the maximum might not be attainable, but in this case, since it's just a linear combination of sine and cosine, the maximum is indeed attainable.

So, I think 540 is the correct answer.

But wait, another approach: perhaps using calculus to maximize the real part.

Given that Real part = 324 cosθ -432 sinθ.

We can write this as R cos(θ + φ), where R is sqrt(324^2 +432^2) =540.

Because, for any expression a cosθ + b sinθ, it can be rewritten as R cos(θ - φ), where R = sqrt(a^2 + b^2) and tanφ = b/a.

So, in this case, tanφ = (-432)/324 = -432/324 = -16/12 = -4/3.

So, φ = arctangent(-4/3). But since R is positive, the maximum value is R.

So, maximum real part is 540.

So, yes, 540 is correct.

Another way: taking derivative.

Let me denote f(θ) =324 cosθ -432 sinθ

df/dθ = -324 sinθ -432 cosθ

Set derivative to zero:

-324 sinθ -432 cosθ =0

324 sinθ +432 cosθ =0

Divide both sides by 108:

3 sinθ +4 cosθ=0

So, 3 sinθ = -4 cosθ

tanθ = -4/3

So, θ = arctan(-4/3). So, θ is in the second or fourth quadrant.

But since tanθ is negative, θ is in second or fourth.

But to find the maximum, we can plug back into f(θ).

At tanθ= -4/3, we can represent sinθ and cosθ as follows:

Let me consider a right triangle with opposite side -4, adjacent 3, hypotenuse 5. So, sinθ = -4/5, cosθ =3/5. But we have to be careful with the signs based on the quadrant.

Wait, but tanθ = -4/3 implies that if θ is in the fourth quadrant, then cosθ is positive, sinθ is negative. If θ is in the second quadrant, cosθ is negative, sinθ is positive.

But let's think: since f(θ) =324 cosθ -432 sinθ, we want to maximize it.

We can write f(θ) as follows:

R cos(θ - φ) =540 cos(θ - φ)

Wait, but earlier, I saw R as 540, so the maximum value is 540.

But perhaps, when we plug θ where tanθ = -4/3, we can get f(θ)=540.

Wait, let's compute f(θ) at θ where tanθ=-4/3.

So, sinθ = -4/5, cosθ=3/5 (if θ is in fourth quadrant)

f(θ)=324*(3/5) -432*(-4/5) = (972/5) + (1728/5) = (972 +1728)/5=2700/5=540.

Similarly, if θ is in second quadrant, sinθ=4/5, cosθ=-3/5:

f(θ)=324*(-3/5) -432*(4/5) = (-972/5) - (1728/5) = (-2700)/5= -540.

So, the maximum is indeed 540, achieved when θ is in the fourth quadrant where cosθ=3/5, sinθ=-4/5.

So, yes, the maximum real part is 540.

Therefore, the answer is 540.

To find the largest possible real part of the expression \((75 + 117i)z + \frac{96 + 144i}{z}\) where \(|z| = 4\), we start by expressing \(z\) as \(4e^{i\theta}\), where \(\theta\) is the argument of \(z\). Substituting \(z = 4e^{i\theta}\) into the expression, we get:

\[
(75 + 117i) \cdot 4e^{i\theta} + \frac{96 + 144i}{4e^{i\theta}} = 4(75 + 117i)e^{i\theta} + (24 + 36i)e^{-i\theta}
\]

Expanding each term into real and imaginary parts, we focus on the real parts:

\[
\text{Real part} = 4(75 \cos\theta - 117 \sin\theta) + (24 \cos\theta + 36 \sin\theta)
\]

Simplifying:

\[
\text{Real part} = 324 \cos\theta - 432 \sin\theta
\]

The maximum value of an expression of the form \(K \cos\theta + M \sin\theta\) is \(\sqrt{K^2 + M^2}\). Thus, the maximum real part is:

\[
\sqrt{324^2 + (-432)^2} = \sqrt{104976 + 186624} = \sqrt{291600} = 540
\]

Therefore, the largest possible real part of the given expression is:

\[
\boxed{540}
\]
