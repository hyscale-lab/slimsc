Okay, let me try to work through this problem step by step. So, we have points O(0,0), A(1/2, 0), and B(0, sqrt(3)/2). The family F consists of segments PQ of unit length in the first quadrant, with P on the x-axis and Q on the y-axis. We need to find a point C on AB (other than A and B) that isn't on any other segment from F except AB. Then, we have to compute OC² and express it as a fraction p/q, where p and q are coprime, and find p + q.

First, let's sketch the problem mentally. O is the origin. A is at (1/2, 0), so halfway along the x-axis between O and (1,0). B is at (0, sqrt(3)/2), which is about (0, 0.866), so somewhere along the y-axis above O but below (0,1). The line AB connects these two points.

The family F consists of all segments PQ of length 1, with P on the x-axis and Q on the y-axis, both in the first quadrant. So, each PQ is a unit segment from some point P(p,0) to Q(0,q), with p and q positive. The length of PQ is 1, so sqrt(p² + q²) = 1. Therefore, p² + q² = 1. So, PQ is a line segment from (p,0) to (0, q), where p and q satisfy p² + q² = 1.

Now, the problem says that there's a unique point C on AB (other than A and B) that doesn't lie on any other segment from F except AB. That means, when we look at all the segments in F, C is only on AB and no other such segment.

We need to find OC². So, let's find coordinates of C first.

Let me think about the line AB. Let's find the equation of line AB.

Points A(1/2, 0) and B(0, sqrt(3)/2). The slope of AB is (sqrt(3)/2 - 0)/(0 - 1/2) = (sqrt(3)/2) / (-1/2) = -sqrt(3).

So, the equation of AB: y - 0 = -sqrt(3)(x - 1/2). So, y = -sqrt(3)x + (sqrt(3)/2).

So, parametric equations for AB can be written as x = t, y = -sqrt(3)t + sqrt(3)/2, where t ranges from 0 to 1/2, since A is at (1/2, 0), and B is at (0, sqrt(3)/2).

Wait, actually, if we let t go from 0 to 1, then when t=0, x=0, y=sqrt(3)/2 (point B), and when t=1, x=1, but that would be beyond point A. Hmm, maybe better to parameterize differently.

Alternatively, using the two-point form: (y - 0) = ((sqrt(3)/2 - 0)/(0 - 1/2))(x - 1/2). As before, that's y = -sqrt(3)(x - 1/2), so y = -sqrt(3)x + sqrt(3)/2.

So, any point C on AB can be written as (x, -sqrt(3)x + sqrt(3)/2), where x is between 0 and 1/2.

Now, we need to find C such that it doesn't lie on any other segment PQ from F except AB.

In other words, for C to lie on AB and on some PQ, but not on any other PQ.

Wait, but C lies on AB, which is itself a segment in F? Because AB is a segment from A(1/2, 0) to B(0, sqrt(3)/2). Let's check the length of AB to see if it's a unit length, which would imply AB is in F.

Compute AB's length: sqrt( (1/2)^2 + (sqrt(3)/2)^2 ) = sqrt(1/4 + 3/4) = sqrt(1) = 1. Yes, so AB is indeed a segment in F, since it's of unit length from (1/2,0) to (0, sqrt(3)/2). So, AB is one of the segments in family F.

Therefore, for the point C on AB, it lies on AB which is in F. But we need C to not lie on any other segment from F. So, C is on AB and on no other PQ in F.

So, we need to find a point C on AB such that it's not on any other segment PQ where PQ is in F (i.e., PQ is a unit segment from (p,0) to (0,q) with p² + q² = 1).

Therefore, we need to find C on AB such that there does not exist any other PQ in F that passes through C, except for AB itself.

Hence, our task reduces to finding C on AB such that no other PQ from F passes through C.

So, perhaps the way to approach this is to model the condition that C lies on AB and on some PQ, but for all other PQ, it doesn't lie on them.

Wait, but maybe a better approach is to find the envelope of all segments PQ in F, and then see where AB intersects this envelope. Because the envelope would be the set of points that are on exactly one PQ in F, so C would be the intersection point of AB with this envelope.

Alternatively, perhaps the envelope is a curve, and AB is tangent to it at point C, meaning that C is the only point on AB that lies on the envelope.

Let me think. The envelope of a family of curves is a curve that is tangent to each member of the family at some point. For our case, the family F is a set of straight line segments. The envelope might be another curve, perhaps a circle or something else.

But wait, the segments PQ are straight lines, each of length 1, with P on x-axis and Q on y-axis. So, each PQ is the line segment from (p,0) to (0, q), where p² + q² = 1.

Wait, but the line PQ itself can be represented parametrically as x/p + y/q = 1, for 0 ≤ x ≤ p and 0 ≤ y ≤ q.

Wait, no. The equation of the line through (p,0) and (0,q) is (x/p) + (y/q) = 1, but only for x between 0 and p, and y between 0 and q.

So, all these lines PQ lie in the first quadrant, from (p,0) to (0,q), with p² + q² =1.

So, perhaps the envelope of all these lines is a curve, and any point on the envelope lies on exactly one such line.

Thus, the point C would be where AB is tangent to this envelope. So, C is where AB touches the envelope of all the lines PQ.

Therefore, our strategy is:

1. Find the envelope of the family of lines PQ.

2. Find where AB is tangent to this envelope; the point of tangency is the required point C.

3. Compute OC².

So, let's try to find the envelope.

To find the envelope of a family of curves, we can use the method involving partial derivatives. For a family of curves F(p, q, x, y) = 0, the envelope satisfies F(p, q, x, y) = 0 and ∂F/∂λ = 0, where λ is a parameter.

In our case, each line PQ can be parameterized by p, since q is determined by p via p² + q² =1. So, we can write each line as F(p, x, y) = (x/p) + (y/q) - 1 =0, with q = sqrt(1 - p²). So, F(p, x, y) = x/p + y/(sqrt(1 - p²)) - 1 =0.

But wait, perhaps it's better to consider both p and q as variables, but with the constraint p² + q² =1. So, the family is F(p, q, x, y) = x/p + y/q -1 =0, subject to p² + q² =1.

So, to find the envelope, we can use the method of Lagrange multipliers. Alternatively, the envelope is found by solving F(p, q, x, y) =0 and ∂F/∂λ =0, where λ is a parameter. But perhaps a more straightforward approach is to eliminate p and q from the equations.

Wait, perhaps another approach. Let me consider that for each (x, y), the line x/p + y/q =1 is in F. So, to find the envelope, we can think of the system:

x/p + y/q =1,

p² + q² =1.

We can solve this system for p and q in terms of x and y, and then eliminate p and q to find an equation in x and y.

Alternatively, consider that for the envelope, each point (x, y) lies on exactly one such line, so the system has exactly one solution for p and q given x and y.

Wait, perhaps using Lagrange multipliers to find the envelope.

Let’s proceed as follows. The envelope is found by solving F(p, q, x, y) =0 and ∂F/∂λ =0, where F(p, q, x, y) = x/p + y/q -1 + λ(p² + q² -1).

Wait, perhaps another way. Let me think of F as F(p, q, x, y) = x/p + y/q -1, with the condition p² + q² =1. So, we can write the envelope condition as:

The system:

x/p + y/q =1,

p² + q² =1,

and the condition that the Jacobian determinant of F and G (where G is the constraint) is zero.

Wait, perhaps more precisely, the envelope is found by solving F(p, q, x, y) =0 and ∂F/∂p (d/dp) - ∂F/∂q (d/dq) =0, but I might be mixing things up.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to parameterize in terms of a single parameter. Let's use p as the parameter, then q = sqrt(1 - p²), but that complicates things because of the square root. Alternatively, let me use a parameter θ, such that p = cosθ and q = sinθ, since p² + q² =1.

So, p = cosθ, q = sinθ, where θ is in the first quadrant, between 0 and π/2.

Then, the line equation becomes x/(cosθ) + y/(sinθ) =1.

So, the family of lines is F(θ, x, y) = x/(cosθ) + y/(sinθ) -1 =0.

Now, to find the envelope, we can take the derivative of F with respect to θ and set it to zero.

So, the envelope satisfies both F(θ, x, y)=0 and ∂F/∂θ =0.

Compute ∂F/∂θ:

d/dθ [x/(cosθ) + y/(sinθ) -1] = x*(sinθ)/(cos²θ) + y*(-cosθ)/(sin²θ) =0.

So, the two equations are:

x/(cosθ) + y/(sinθ) =1,

and

x*(sinθ)/(cos²θ) - y*(cosθ)/(sin²θ) =0.

We can write these as:

Equation 1: x secθ + y cscθ =1,

Equation 2: x tanθ secθ - y cotθ cscθ =0.

Now, let's denote t = tanθ. Since θ is in (0, π/2), t is positive.

We can express everything in terms of t.

Let me set t = tanθ, so that sinθ = t / sqrt(1 + t²), cosθ = 1 / sqrt(1 + t²).

Then, secθ = sqrt(1 + t²),

cscθ = sqrt(1 + t²)/t,

tanθ = t,

cotθ = 1/t,

So, Equation 1 becomes:

x * sqrt(1 + t²) + y * (sqrt(1 + t²)/t) =1.

Equation 2 becomes:

x * t * sqrt(1 + t²) - y * (1/t) * (sqrt(1 + t²)/t) =0.

Simplify equation 2:

x t sqrt(1 + t²) - y (sqrt(1 + t²)/t²) =0.

Multiply both sides by t² to eliminate denominators:

x t^3 sqrt(1 + t²) - y sqrt(1 + t²) =0.

Factor out sqrt(1 + t²):

sqrt(1 + t²) (x t^3 - y) =0.

Since sqrt(1 + t²) is never zero, we have x t^3 - y =0 => y = x t^3.

Now, substitute y =x t^3 into equation 1:

x * sqrt(1 + t²) + (x t^3) * (sqrt(1 + t²)/t ) =1.

Simplify the second term:

(x t^3) * (sqrt(1 + t²)/t ) = x t^2 sqrt(1 + t²).

So, equation 1 becomes:

x sqrt(1 + t²) + x t^2 sqrt(1 + t²) =1.

Factor x sqrt(1 + t²):

x sqrt(1 + t²) (1 + t^2) =1.

But 1 + t^2 = (1 + t^2), so sqrt(1 + t^2) * (1 + t^2) = (1 + t^2)^(3/2).

Therefore, x (1 + t^2)^(3/2) =1 => x = 1 / (1 + t^2)^(3/2).

And since y =x t^3, we have y = t^3 / (1 + t^2)^(3/2).

So, the envelope is parametrized by t as:

x(t) = 1 / (1 + t^2)^(3/2),

y(t) = t^3 / (1 + t^2)^(3/2).

Now, we can eliminate t to find the equation in x and y.

Let me compute y in terms of x.

From x = 1 / (1 + t^2)^(3/2),

=> (1 + t^2)^(3/2) = 1/x,

=> 1 + t^2 = (1/x)^(2/3),

=> t^2 = (1/x)^(2/3) -1,

=> t = sqrt( (1/x)^(2/3) -1 ).

But perhaps a better approach is to express y in terms of x.

We have y = t^3 x.

From x(t) = 1 / (1 + t^2)^(3/2),

Let’s set s = t^2. Then, x = 1 / (1 + s)^(3/2),

and y = t^3 x = t^3 * 1/(1 + s)^(3/2).

But since s = t^2, t = sqrt(s), so y = s^(3/2) * 1/(1 + s)^(3/2) = (s/(1 + s))^ (3/2).

So, y = (s/(1+s))^(3/2), and x = 1/(1 + s)^(3/2).

Let me express s in terms of x.

From x = 1/(1 + s)^(3/2),

=> (1 + s)^(3/2) = 1/x,

=> 1 + s = (1/x)^(2/3),

=> s = (1/x)^(2/3) -1.

Now, substitute s into y:

y = [ (s)/(1 + s) ]^(3/2 )

= [ ( (1/x)^(2/3) -1 ) / ( (1/x)^(2/3) ) ) ]^(3/2 )

Simplify numerator:

( (1/x)^(2/3) -1 ) = (1/x^(2/3)) -1 = (1 - x^(2/3)) / x^(2/3)

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to write s = (1/x^(2/3)) -1.

So,

y = [ s/(1 + s) ]^(3/2 )

= [ ( (1/x^(2/3) -1 ) ) / (1/x^(2/3) ) ]^(3/2 )

= [ (1 - x^(2/3)) / 1 ]^(3/2 )

= (1 - x^(2/3) )^(3/2 )

So, y = (1 - x^(2/3) )^(3/2 )

Hmm, perhaps that's the equation of the envelope.

So, the envelope is y = (1 - x^(2/3))^(3/2 )

Alternatively, let's square both sides to eliminate the exponent:

y^2 = (1 - x^(2/3))^3

Expanding the right-hand side:

(1 - x^(2/3))^3 = 1 - 3x^(2/3) + 3x^(4/3) - x^2

So, y^2 = 1 - 3x^(2/3) + 3x^(4/3) - x^2

But perhaps another approach is better.

Let me check the parametric equations again:

x = 1/(1 + t^2)^(3/2 )

y = t^3/(1 + t^2)^(3/2 )

Let me compute y as a function of x.

Let’s set u = t^2, so that x = 1/(1 + u)^(3/2 ), y = (u^(3/2 )) / (1 + u)^(3/2 )

So, y = (u/(1 + u))^(3/2 )

But u = (1/x^(2/3)) -1, as before.

Wait, perhaps it's better to square both x and y.

Let me compute x^2 and y^2.

x^2 = 1/(1 + t^2)^3,

y^2 = t^6/(1 + t^2)^3.

So, y^2 = t^6 x^2.

But t^6 = (t^2)^3 = u^3.

But u = (1/x^(2/3)) -1,

So, y^2 = [ (1/x^(2/3) -1 )^3 ] * x^2.

Hmm, not sure if that helps.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to note that on the envelope, we have y = x t^3, and from equation 2, we have y = x t^3.

But from x = 1/(1 + t^2)^(3/2),

Let me try to express t in terms of x.

x = 1/(1 + t^2)^(3/2)

Take both sides to the power of 2/3:

x^(2/3) = 1/(1 + t^2 )

So, 1 + t^2 = 1/x^(2/3 )

=> t^2 = (1/x^(2/3)) -1

=> t = sqrt( (1/x^(2/3)) -1 )

So, t = (1/x^(1/3)) sqrt(1 - x^(2/3)) )

Wait, perhaps not the most useful.

But, since y =x t^3,

Let me compute t^3:

t^3 = [ (1/x^(2/3) -1 ) ]^(3/2 )

But this seems complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to note that the envelope is a semicubical parabola or some other type of curve, but I'm not sure. Maybe it's a circle or something else.

Wait, perhaps we can find the equation in x and y without parametric.

Let me note that from the parametric equations:

x = 1/(1 + t^2)^(3/2 )

y = t^3/(1 + t^2)^(3/2 )

Let me consider taking the ratio y/x:

y/x = t^3

So, t = (y/x)^(1/3 )

Now, substitute this into x's equation:

x = 1/(1 + t^2)^(3/2 )

Let me express 1 + t^2:

1 + t^2 = 1 + (y/x)^(2/3 )

So,

x = 1 / [1 + (y/x)^(2/3 ) ]^(3/2 )

Let me write this as:

x = [1 + (y/x)^(2/3 ) ]^(-3/2 )

Multiply both sides by [1 + (y/x)^(2/3 ) ]^(3/2 ):

x [1 + (y/x)^(2/3 ) ]^(3/2 ) =1

This seems complicated, but perhaps I can raise both sides to the power of 2/3 to make it manageable.

But maybe a better approach is to cube both sides to eliminate the fractional exponents.

Alternatively, let me make a substitution to simplify. Let’s set z = y^(1/3), and see if that helps, but perhaps that's overcomplicating.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to accept that the envelope is given parametrically by x(t) and y(t) as above, and proceed.

Now, our next goal is to find where AB is tangent to this envelope. Because the point C is where AB touches the envelope, making it the only point on AB that lies on the envelope, and hence only on AB in F.

So, the line AB is given by y = -sqrt(3)x + sqrt(3)/2.

We need to find the point C on AB that lies on the envelope, and is the point of tangency.

So, we can set up the system:

y = -sqrt(3)x + sqrt(3)/2,

and y = (1 - x^(2/3))^(3/2 )

But that would give us the points of intersection between AB and the envelope. Since AB is tangent, there should be exactly one solution (the point C).

So, we can set up the equation:

-sqrt(3)x + sqrt(3)/2 = (1 - x^(2/3))^(3/2 )

Let me square both sides to eliminate the exponent on the right:

[ -sqrt(3)x + sqrt(3)/2 ]^2 = [ (1 - x^(2/3))^(3/2 ) ]^2

Simplify both sides:

Left side: [ -sqrt(3)x + sqrt(3)/2 ]^2 = (sqrt(3))² [ (-x + 1/2) ]^2 = 3*(x - 1/2)^2.

Right side: (1 - x^(2/3))^3.

So, equation becomes:

3*(x - 1/2)^2 = (1 - x^(2/3))^3.

Let me let u = x^(1/3), so that x = u^3.

Then, x^(2/3) = u^2,

and (x - 1/2) = u^3 - 1/2.

So, the equation becomes:

3*(u^3 - 1/2)^2 = (1 - u^2)^3.

Let me expand both sides.

First, expand (u^3 - 1/2)^2:

= u^6 - u^3 + 1/4.

So, left side: 3*(u^6 - u^3 + 1/4 ) = 3u^6 - 3u^3 + 3/4.

Right side: (1 - u^2)^3 = 1 - 3u^2 + 3u^4 - u^6.

So, the equation is:

3u^6 - 3u^3 + 3/4 = 1 - 3u^2 + 3u^4 - u^6.

Bring all terms to left side:

3u^6 -3u^3 +3/4 -1 +3u^2 -3u^4 +u^6 =0.

Combine like terms:

(3u^6 + u^6) + (-3u^4) + (-3u^3) + (3u^2) + (3/4 -1) = 0.

So,

4u^6 -3u^4 -3u^3 +3u^2 -1/4 =0.

Hmm, this seems complicated. Maybe I made a mistake in substitution.

Wait, let me check the substitution again.

We had x = u^3, so x^(2/3) = u^2, correct.

Left side: 3*(x - 1/2)^2 = 3*(u^3 - 1/2)^2.

Wait, expanding (u^3 - 1/2)^2:

= u^6 - u^3 + 1/4. Yes, correct.

So, 3*(u^6 - u^3 + 1/4) = 3u^6 - 3u^3 + 3/4. Correct.

Right side: (1 - u^2)^3 = 1 - 3u^2 + 3u^4 - u^6. Correct.

So, moving everything to left:

3u^6 -3u^3 + 3/4 -1 +3u^2 -3u^4 +u^6 = 0.

Wait, that's 3u^6 + u^6 = 4u^6,

Then, -3u^4,

-3u^3,

+3u^2,

3/4 -1 = -1/4.

So, equation: 4u^6 -3u^4 -3u^3 +3u^2 -1/4=0.

Hmm, this is a 6th-degree polynomial in u, which seems difficult. Maybe I can factor it or find rational roots.

Let me try possible rational roots using Rational Root Theorem. The possible roots are factors of 1/4 over factors of 4, so possible roots are ±1, ±1/2, ±1/4, etc.

Let me test u=1/2.

Plug u=1/2 into the equation:

4*(1/2)^6 -3*(1/2)^4 -3*(1/2)^3 +3*(1/2)^2 -1/4.

Compute each term:

4*(1/64) = 4/64 =1/16,

-3*(1/16) = -3/16,

-3*(1/8) = -3/8,

3*(1/4) = 3/4,

-1/4 remains.

So,

1/16 -3/16 -3/8 +3/4 -1/4.

Convert all to 16 denominators:

1/16 -3/16 -6/16 +12/16 -4/16.

Add them up:

1 -3 -6 +12 -4 = (1-3)= -2; (-2-6)= -8; (-8+12)=4; (4-4)=0.

So, u=1/2 is a root. Therefore, (u - 1/2) is a factor.

Let's perform polynomial division or use synthetic division to factor out (u - 1/2).

Using synthetic division for polynomial 4u^6 -3u^4 -3u^3 +3u^2 -1/4, divided by (u - 1/2).

Wait, but the polynomial is 4u^6 +0u^5 -3u^4 -3u^3 +3u^2 +0u -1/4.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to use substitution to make it a polynomial in v= u -1/2, but that might complicate.

Alternatively, perhaps using polynomial division.

But perhaps using synthetic division with u=1/2.

The coefficients are:

u^6: 4,

u^5: 0,

u^4: -3,

u^3: -3,

u^2: 3,

u: 0,

constant: -1/4.

Set up synthetic division:

1/2 | 4   0   -3   -3   3   0   -1/4

Bring down 4.

Multiply 4 by 1/2 =2. Add to next term: 0 +2=2.

Multiply 2 by 1/2=1. Add to next term: -3 +1=-2.

Multiply -2 by 1/2=-1. Add to next term: -3 + (-1)= -4.

Multiply -4 by 1/2=-2. Add to next term:3 + (-2)=1.

Multiply 1 by 1/2=0.5. Add to next term:0 +0.5=0.5.

Multiply 0.5 by 1/2=0.25. Add to last term: -1/4 +0.25=0. Correct.

So, the result is:

4u^5 + 2u^4 -2u^3 -4u^2 + u +0.5.

Wait, but wait, let me check the coefficients:

After division, the coefficients are:

4, 2, -2, -4, 1, 0.5.

So, the polynomial is (u - 1/2)(4u^5 + 2u^4 -2u^3 -4u^2 +u + 0.5)=0.

Now, we need to check if the quintic (5th-degree) polynomial can be factored further.

Let me try to factor 4u^5 + 2u^4 -2u^3 -4u^2 +u + 0.5.

Perhaps we can factor by grouping.

Group terms as (4u^5 +2u^4) + (-2u^3 -4u^2) + (u +0.5).

Factor each group:

2u^4(2u +1) -2u^2(u +2) + (u + 0.5).

Hmm, not obvious.

Alternatively, perhaps try to factor out a (2u +1).

Let me see if u=-1/2 is a root.

Plug u=-1/2 into the quintic:

4*(-1/2)^5 +2*(-1/2)^4 -2*(-1/2)^3 -4*(-1/2)^2 + (-1/2) +0.5.

Compute each term:

4*(-1/32) = -1/8,

2*(1/16)=1/8,

-2*(-1/8)=1/4,

-4*(1/4)= -1,

(-1/2) + 0.5 = 0.

So, total:

-1/8 +1/8 +1/4 -1 +0 = (-1/8 +1/8)=0; 0 +1/4=1/4; 1/4 -1= -3/4 ≠0.

So, u=-1/2 is not a root.

Alternatively, perhaps try u=1/2 again.

Compute 4*(1/2)^5 +2*(1/2)^4 -2*(1/2)^3 -4*(1/2)^2 + (1/2) +0.5.

Which is:

4*(1/32) = 1/8,

2*(1/16)=1/8,

-2*(1/8)= -1/4,

-4*(1/4)= -1,

1/2 +0.5=1.

Adding up:

1/8 +1/8= 1/4,

1/4 -1/4=0,

0 -1= -1,

-1 +1=0.

So, u=1/2 is another root. Therefore, (u -1/2) is a factor again.

Let's perform synthetic division again on the quintic with u=1/2.

The quintic coefficients are: 4,2,-2,-4,1,0.5.

Wait, no, the quintic was 4u^5 +2u^4 -2u^3 -4u^2 +u +0.5.

So, coefficients are:

4, 2, -2, -4, 1, 0.5.

Using u=1/2:

Bring down 4.

4 * 1/2=2. Add to next term: 2 +2=4.

4 * 1/2=2. Add to next term: -2 +2=0.

0 *1/2=0. Add to next term: -4 +0=-4.

-4 *1/2=-2. Add to next term:1 + (-2)=-1.

-1 *1/2=-0.5. Add to last term:0.5 + (-0.5)=0. Correct.

So, the quintic factors as (u -1/2)(4u^4 +4u^3 +0u^2 -4u -1).

So, the original polynomial factors as:

(u -1/2)^2 (4u^4 +4u^3 -4u -1) =0.

Now, let's factor the quartic 4u^4 +4u^3 -4u -1.

Perhaps by grouping:

Group as (4u^4 +4u^3) + (-4u -1).

Factor out 4u^3 from first group: 4u^3(u +1).

Second group: -1(4u +1).

Not helpful. Alternatively, perhaps try to factor it as (au^2 + bu +c)(du^2 + eu +f).

But this might be time-consuming. Alternatively, perhaps try rational roots.

Possible rational roots are ±1, ±1/2, ±1/4.

Testing u=1:

4(1)^4 +4(1)^3 -4(1) -1=4+4-4-1=3≠0.

u=-1:

4(-1)^4 +4(-1)^3 -4(-1) -1=4 -4 +4 -1=3≠0.

u=1/2:

4*(1/2)^4 +4*(1/2)^3 -4*(1/2) -1=4*(1/16)+4*(1/8) -2 -1= 1/4 + 1/2 -2 -1= (3/4) -3= -9/4 ≠0.

u=-1/2:

4*(1/16) +4*(-1/8) -4*(-1/2) -1= 1/4 - 1/2 +2 -1= (1/4 - 1/2)= -1/4; (-1/4 +2)=7/4; 7/4 -1=3/4 ≠0.

u=1/4:

4*(1/4)^4 +4*(1/4)^3 -4*(1/4) -1.

=4*(1/256) +4*(1/64) -1 -1.

=1/64 + 1/16 -1 -1.

= (1/64 + 4/64) =5/64,

5/64 -2= -123/64 ≠0.

u=-1/4:

4*(1/256) +4*(-1/64) -4*(-1/4) -1.

=1/64 -1/16 +1 -1.

= (1/64 -4/64)= -3/64,

-3/64 +0= -3/64 ≠0.

So, no rational roots. So, perhaps this quartic doesn't factor nicely. Therefore, our equation is:

(u -1/2)^2 (4u^4 +4u^3 -4u -1) =0.

So, the real roots we found are u=1/2 (double root). The other roots are from the quartic, which may not be real or may not correspond to our problem's context.

Since we're dealing with the first quadrant and u = x^(1/3), which for x >0, u>0.

So, u=1/2 is a real root. Let me check if this is the only real root we need. Since AB is tangent to the envelope at C, and we are looking for a unique point, perhaps u=1/2 is the solution.

So, let's take u=1/2, which implies x = u^3 = (1/2)^3=1/8.

Then, y = -sqrt(3)x + sqrt(3)/2 = -sqrt(3)*(1/8) + sqrt(3)/2 = (-sqrt(3)/8) + (4sqrt(3)/8) )= (3sqrt(3)/8).

So, point C is at (1/8, 3sqrt(3)/8).

Wait, but we need to confirm that this is indeed the point where AB is tangent to the envelope.

Alternatively, perhaps we can compute the derivative of the envelope at point C and see if it's equal to the slope of AB, which is -sqrt(3).

Let me compute dy/dx for the envelope.

From parametric equations:

x = 1/(1 + t^2)^(3/2 ),

y = t^3/(1 + t^2)^(3/2 ).

Compute dy/dx:

dy/dx = (dy/dt) / (dx/dt).

Compute dy/dt:

dy/dt = [3t^2 (1 + t^2)^(3/2) - t^3 * (3/2)(2t)(1 + t^2)^(1/2) ] / (1 + t^2)^3.

Wait, perhaps it's better to compute using the quotient rule.

Alternatively, compute derivative using the parametric expressions.

Let me compute dx/dt and dy/dt.

x = (1 + t^2)^(-3/2 )

dx/dt = (-3/2)(1 + t^2)^(-5/2) * 2t = -3t (1 + t^2)^(-5/2).

Similarly, y = t^3 (1 + t^2)^(-3/2 )

dy/dt = 3t^2 (1 + t^2)^(-3/2 ) + t^3 (-3/2)(2t)(1 + t^2)^(-5/2 )

= 3t^2 (1 + t^2)^(-3/2 ) - 3t^4 (1 + t^2)^(-5/2 )

Factor out 3t^2 (1 + t^2)^(-5/2 ):

= 3t^2 (1 + t^2)^(-5/2 ) [ (1 + t^2) - t^2 ]

= 3t^2 (1 + t^2)^(-5/2 ) [1]

= 3t^2 (1 + t^2)^(-5/2 )

So, dy/dt = 3t^2 / (1 + t^2)^(5/2 )

Similarly, dx/dt = -3t / (1 + t^2)^(5/2 )

Thus,

dy/dx = (dy/dt)/(dx/dt) = [3t^2 / (1 + t^2)^(5/2 ) ] / [ -3t / (1 + t^2)^(5/2 ) ] = (3t^2) / (-3t ) ) = -t.

So, the slope of the envelope at any point t is dy/dx = -t.

At point C, where AB is tangent to the envelope, the slope of AB is -sqrt(3), so:

-t = -sqrt(3) => t = sqrt(3).

So, t = sqrt(3).

Therefore, the point C is given by:

x = 1/(1 + t^2)^(3/2 ) = 1/(1 + 3)^(3/2 ) =1/(4)^(3/2 )=1/(8).

y = t^3/(1 + t^2)^(3/2 )= ( (sqrt(3))^3 ) / (4)^(3/2 )= (3*sqrt(3)) / (8).

So, point C is at (1/8, 3sqrt(3)/8).

So, OC² is (1/8)^2 + (3sqrt(3)/8)^2 =1/64 + (27)/64 =28/64 =7/16.

Wait, 3sqrt(3) squared is 9*3=27, so:

(1/8)^2 =1/64,

(3sqrt(3)/8)^2=27/64,

So, total OC²=1/64 +27/64=28/64=7/16.

Thus, p=7, q=16, so p + q=23.

Wait, but wait, I thought earlier that u=1/2, which would imply x=1/8, but from the envelope equation, we found t=sqrt(3) leading to x=1/8. That seems correct.

So, the final answer is 7/16, so p + q=7+16=23.

To solve the problem, we first determine the equation of the line segment AB. Points A and B are given as \( A\left(\frac{1}{2}, 0\right) \) and \( B\left(0, \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right) \). The slope of AB is calculated as:
\[
\text{slope} = \frac{\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} - 0}{0 - \frac{1}{2}} = -\sqrt{3}
\]
Thus, the equation of line AB is:
\[
y = -\sqrt{3}x + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}
\]

Next, we consider the family of segments PQ where P is on the x-axis, Q is on the y-axis, and the length of PQ is 1. Each such segment can be represented by the line:
\[
\frac{x}{p} + \frac{y}{q} = 1
\]
with the constraint \( p^2 + q^2 = 1 \).

To find the envelope of these lines, we use the method of parametrization. Let \( p = \cos\theta \) and \( q = \sin\theta \), so the line equation becomes:
\[
\frac{x}{\cos\theta} + \frac{y}{\sin\theta} = 1
\]
We then find the envelope by solving for the conditions where the line is tangent to the envelope curve. After some algebraic manipulation, we find that the envelope is given by:
\[
y = \left(1 - x^{2/3}\right)^{3/2}
\]

We then determine where the line AB is tangent to this envelope. By solving the system of equations, we find the point of tangency \( C \) on AB. After some calculations, we find that \( C \) has coordinates \( \left(\frac{1}{8}, \frac{3\sqrt{3}}{8}\right) \).

Finally, we compute \( OC^2 \):
\[
OC^2 = \left(\frac{1}{8}\right)^2 + \left(\frac{3\sqrt{3}}{8}\right)^2 = \frac{1}{64} + \frac{27}{64} = \frac{28}{64} = \frac{7}{16}
\]
Thus, \( p = 7 \) and \( q = 16 \), leading to \( p + q = 23 \).

\boxed{23}
