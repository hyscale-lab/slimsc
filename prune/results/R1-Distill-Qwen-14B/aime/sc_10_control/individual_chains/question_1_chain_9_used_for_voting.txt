Okay, so I have this problem with logarithms and three variables x, y, z. They're all positive real numbers, which is good because logarithms of non-positive numbers aren't defined. The problem gives me three equations involving logarithms base 2, and I need to find the absolute value of log base 2 of (x^4 y^3 z^2), then express that as a fraction m/n where m and n are coprime, and finally find m + n.

Let me write down the equations:

1. log₂(x / (y z)) = 1/2
2. log₂(y / (x z)) = 1/3
3. log₂(z / (x y)) = 1/4

I need to solve for x, y, z and then compute |log₂(x^4 y^3 z^2)|.

Hmm, maybe I can rewrite these logarithmic equations in exponential form to make them easier to handle. Remember that log_b(a) = c is equivalent to b^c = a.

So, rewriting each equation:

1. 2^(1/2) = x / (y z)
2. 2^(1/3) = y / (x z)
3. 2^(1/4) = z / (x y)

Let me denote these as equations (1), (2), and (3) respectively.

So, equation (1): x = 2^(1/2) * y z
Equation (2): y = 2^(1/3) * x z
Equation (3): z = 2^(1/4) * x y

This looks like a system of equations where each variable is expressed in terms of the others. Maybe I can substitute them into each other to find expressions for x, y, z.

Let me try to express all variables in terms of one variable, say x, then solve for x first.

From equation (1): x = 2^(1/2) * y z. Let me solve for y in terms of x and z.

Wait, maybe it's better to express y and z in terms of x.

From equation (2): y = 2^(1/3) * x z. So, if I can express z in terms of x, I can substitute into equation (3).

From equation (3): z = 2^(1/4) * x y. But from equation (2), y is 2^(1/3) x z. So substitute that into equation (3):

z = 2^(1/4) * x * [2^(1/3) x z] = 2^(1/4 + 1/3) * x^2 z

Simplify the exponents: 1/4 + 1/3 is... let me compute that.

1/4 is 3/12, 1/3 is 4/12, so together it's 7/12. So,

z = 2^(7/12) x^2 z

Hmm, so z = 2^(7/12) x^2 z. Let's subtract 2^(7/12) x^2 z from both sides:

z - 2^(7/12) x^2 z = 0

Factor out z:

z (1 - 2^(7/12) x^2) = 0

But z is a positive real number, so z ≠ 0. Therefore:

1 - 2^(7/12) x^2 = 0

Which implies:

2^(7/12) x^2 = 1

So, x^2 = 2^(-7/12)

Taking square roots, since x is positive:

x = 2^(-7/24)

Wait, because sqrt(2^(-7/12)) = 2^(-7/24). Right.

Now that I have x, I can find y and z.

From equation (2): y = 2^(1/3) * x z

But I need z in terms of x. Let's use equation (3): z = 2^(1/4) * x y

But since y is expressed in terms of x and z, this might get circular. Maybe substitute x into equation (1) or (2).

Wait, perhaps it's better to express y and z in terms of x, and then plug back into one of the equations.

But let me see: I have x = 2^(-7/24). Let me compute 2^(-7/24) as (2^(1/24))^(-7) or something, but maybe it's better to keep it as is for now.

Let me go back to equation (1): x = 2^(1/2) y z

We have x = 2^(-7/24), so:

2^(-7/24) = 2^(1/2) y z

Divide both sides by 2^(1/2):

y z = 2^(-7/24 - 1/2)

Compute exponent: -7/24 - 1/2 = -7/24 - 12/24 = -19/24

So y z = 2^(-19/24)

Similarly, from equation (2): y = 2^(1/3) x z

We have x = 2^(-7/24), so:

y = 2^(1/3) * 2^(-7/24) * z

Combine exponents: 1/3 is 8/24, so 8/24 -7/24 = 1/24. So:

y = 2^(1/24) z

So y is expressed in terms of z. Now, from equation (1), we have y z = 2^(-19/24). Let me substitute y = 2^(1/24) z into y z:

(2^(1/24) z) * z = 2^(-19/24)

Which is 2^(1/24) z^2 = 2^(-19/24)

Divide both sides by 2^(1/24):

z^2 = 2^(-19/24 - 1/24) = 2^(-20/24) = 2^(-5/6)

Take square roots:

z = 2^(-5/12) since z is positive.

Now, z is known as 2^(-5/12). Now, substitute back into y = 2^(1/24) z:

y = 2^(1/24) * 2^(-5/12) = 2^(1/24 - 10/24) because 5/12 is 10/24.

1/24 -10/24 = -9/24 = -3/8.

So y = 2^(-3/8)

So, summarizing:

x = 2^(-7/24)

y = 2^(-3/8)

z = 2^(-5/12)

Now, I need to compute log₂(x^4 y^3 z^2) and then take its absolute value.

First, let's compute the exponent:

log₂(x^4 y^3 z^2) = 4 log₂ x + 3 log₂ y + 2 log₂ z

Since log₂(a^b) = b log₂ a.

But since x, y, z are powers of 2, log₂ x is just the exponent.

So:

log₂ x = -7/24

log₂ y = -3/8

log₂ z = -5/12

Therefore:

4*(-7/24) + 3*(-3/8) + 2*(-5/12)

Let me compute each term:

First term: 4*(-7/24) = (-28)/24 = (-7)/6

Second term: 3*(-3/8) = (-9)/8

Third term: 2*(-5/12) = (-10)/12 = (-5)/6

Now, sum them all:

(-7/6) + (-9/8) + (-5/6)

Let's find a common denominator. 6, 8, 6. The least common multiple is 24.

Convert each:

-7/6 = -28/24

-9/8 = -27/24

-5/6 = -20/24

Sum: (-28 -27 -20)/24 = (-75)/24

Simplify: Divide numerator and denominator by 3.

-75 ÷3 = -25

24 ÷3 = 8

So, (-25)/8

But the question asks for the absolute value of this, so | -25/8 | = 25/8

So, the value is 25/8, which is m/n where m=25, n=8. They are coprime since 25 is 5² and 8 is 2³, no common factors.

Thus, m +n = 25 +8 =33.

To solve the problem, we start by converting the given logarithmic equations into exponential form:

1. \( \log_2\left(\frac{x}{yz}\right) = \frac{1}{2} \) implies \( \frac{x}{yz} = 2^{1/2} \).
2. \( \log_2\left(\frac{y}{xz}\right) = \frac{1}{3} \) implies \( \frac{y}{xz} = 2^{1/3} \).
3. \( \log_2\left(\frac{z}{xy}\right) = \frac{1}{4} \) implies \( \frac{z}{xy} = 2^{1/4} \).

Rewriting these, we get:
- \( x = 2^{1/2} \cdot yz \)
- \( y = 2^{1/3} \cdot xz \)
- \( z = 2^{1/4} \cdot xy \)

Substituting \( y = 2^{1/3} \cdot xz \) into the third equation, we find:
\[ z = 2^{1/4} \cdot x \cdot (2^{1/3} \cdot xz) = 2^{7/12} \cdot x^2 z \]
Solving for \( z \), we get:
\[ z = 2^{-5/12} \]

Substituting \( z = 2^{-5/12} \) back, we find:
- \( x = 2^{-7/24} \)
- \( y = 2^{-3/8} \)

Now, compute \( \log_2(x^4 y^3 z^2) \):
\[
\log_2(x^4 y^3 z^2) = 4\log_2 x + 3\log_2 y + 2\log_2 z = 4(-7/24) + 3(-3/8) + 2(-5/12) = -25/8
\]
Taking the absolute value, we get \( 25/8 \). Thus, \( m = 25 \), \( n = 8 \), and \( m + n = 33 \).

\boxed{33}
