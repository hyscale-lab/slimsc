Okay, so I've got this geometry problem here. Let me read it again to make sure I understand it.

We have triangle ABC with circumcenter O and incenter I. It's given that IA is perpendicular to OI. The circumradius is 13, and the inradius is 6. We need to find the product AB times AC. Hmm, interesting.

Alright, let me recall some properties of triangle centers. The circumcenter O is the center of the circumscribed circle, and the incenter I is the center of the inscribed circle. IA is one of the angle bisectors, right? Because the incenter lies at the intersection of the angle bisectors.

Now, it's given that IA is perpendicular to OI. So, the line from the incenter I to vertex A is perpendicular to the line from the incenter I to the circumcenter O. That seems like a specific condition. I wonder what kind of triangle satisfies this.

I remember that in a triangle, the Euler line connects several centers, including the circumcenter, centroid, and orthocenter. But the incenter doesn't generally lie on the Euler line unless the triangle has some special properties, like being equilateral. But this triangle isn't necessarily equilateral because the circumradius and inradius are different (13 vs. 6). So, it's not equilateral.

Maybe it's a right-angled triangle? Let me check. In a right-angled triangle, the circumradius is half the hypotenuse, so if the circumradius is 13, the hypotenuse would be 26. But the inradius formula for a right-angled triangle is r = (a + b - c)/2, where c is the hypotenuse. If r is 6, then a + b - c = 12. Since c is 26, then a + b = 38. But I'm not sure if this directly helps yet.

Wait, but the condition IA perpendicular to OI might not necessarily mean it's right-angled. Let me think of another approach.

Let me recall that in a triangle, the distance between the incenter and circumcenter is given by the formula: OI = sqrt(R(R - 2r)), where R is the circumradius and r is the inradius. Plugging in the given values, OI = sqrt(13*(13 - 12)) = sqrt(13*1) = sqrt(13). So, the length of OI is sqrt(13).

Since IA is perpendicular to OI, the triangle formed by points I, A, and O is a right-angled triangle at I. So, in triangle IOA, angle at I is 90 degrees. Therefore, by the Pythagorean theorem, we have:

OA^2 = IO^2 + IA^2

But OA is the circumradius, so OA = 13. We already know IO is sqrt(13), so plugging in:

13^2 = (sqrt(13))^2 + IA^2
169 = 13 + IA^2
IA^2 = 169 - 13 = 156
IA = sqrt(156) = 2*sqrt(39)

Okay, so IA is 2*sqrt(39). Now, IA is the length from the incenter to vertex A. I remember that in a triangle, the distance from the incenter to a vertex can be expressed in terms of the triangle's sides and angles.

Specifically, the length IA can be expressed as IA = (r)/sin(A/2), where r is the inradius and A is the measure of angle at vertex A. Let me verify that formula.

Yes, in a triangle, the distance from the inradius to a vertex can be found using the formula:

d = \frac{r}{\sin(\theta/2)}

where Î¸ is the angle at that vertex. So, for vertex A, IA = r / sin(A/2).

Given that, we have IA = 6 / sin(A/2) = 2*sqrt(39). So,

6 / sin(A/2) = 2*sqrt(39)
=> sin(A/2) = 6 / (2*sqrt(39)) = 3 / sqrt(39) = sqrt(39)/13

Wait, let me compute that again:

sin(A/2) = 6 / (2*sqrt(39)) = 3 / sqrt(39) = (3*sqrt(39)) / 39 = sqrt(39)/13.

Yes, because 3/sqrt(39) can be rationalized as (3*sqrt(39))/39, which simplifies to sqrt(39)/13.

So, sin(A/2) = sqrt(39)/13.

Now, let's find cos(A/2). Since sin^2(x) + cos^2(x) = 1,

cos^2(A/2) = 1 - (39)/(169) = (169 - 39)/169 = 130/169
=> cos(A/2) = sqrt(130)/13.

Because A is an angle in a triangle, so A/2 is less than 90 degrees, so cos(A/2) is positive.

Now, another formula I remember is that in a triangle, the product of the lengths of two sides is equal to 2R times the product of the sine of the opposite angles. Wait, maybe that's not exactly it. Let me think.

Alternatively, using the formula for the area of a triangle. The area can be expressed in terms of the inradius as Area = r * s, where s is the semi-perimeter. Also, the area can be expressed using the formula (a*b*c)/(4R), where a, b, c are the sides, and R is the circumradius.

But maybe we can relate this to the given condition. Let me think about the sides AB and AC. Let me denote AB = c, AC = b, and BC = a. Then, the semi-perimeter s = (a + b + c)/2.

But I'm supposed to find AB * AC, which is b * c.

Wait, another formula I remember is that in a triangle, the length of the angle bisector can be related to the sides. But since IA is an angle bisector, but we have its length as well. Hmm, maybe that's a way to go.

Alternatively, perhaps using trigonometric identities involving the inradius and the exradius.

Wait, there's a formula that relates the product of two sides with the inradius and the semi-perimeter. Let me recall:

In a triangle, the area is r * s, and also area is (1/2)*ab*sin(C). Maybe I can relate these.

Alternatively, perhaps using the formula for the length of the angle bisector. I think the length of the internal angle bisector from angle A is given by:

IA = (2bc cos(A/2)) / (b + c)

Wait, is that correct? Let me think. I think the formula for the length of the angle bisector is a bit more complex.

Wait, the formula for the length of the angle bisector from A is:

d = (2bc cos(A/2)) / (b + c)

Yes, that seems right. Because the angle bisector divides the opposite side in the ratio of the adjacent sides, and the formula for the length involves the cosine of half the angle.

So, in this case, IA is the length of the angle bisector from A, which is equal to (2bc cos(A/2)) / (b + c). Earlier, we found that IA is 2*sqrt(39), and cos(A/2) is sqrt(130)/13.

So, plugging in:

2*sqrt(39) = (2*b*c*(sqrt(130)/13)) / (b + c)

Simplify this equation:

Multiply both sides by (b + c):

2*sqrt(39)*(b + c) = (2*b*c*sqrt(130)/13)

Divide both sides by 2:

sqrt(39)*(b + c) = (b*c*sqrt(130)/13)

Let me write this as:

sqrt(39)*(b + c) = (b*c*sqrt(130))/13

Let me rearrange terms:

(b*c*sqrt(130))/13 - sqrt(39)*(b + c) = 0

Hmm, this seems a bit messy. Maybe I can factor out sqrt(13):

sqrt(130) = sqrt(13*10) = sqrt(13)*sqrt(10)

Similarly, sqrt(39) = sqrt(13*3) = sqrt(13)*sqrt(3)

So, substituting:

sqrt(13)*sqrt(10)*(b*c)/13 - sqrt(13)*sqrt(3)*(b + c) = 0

Factor out sqrt(13):

sqrt(13) [ (sqrt(10)*(b*c)/13) - sqrt(3)*(b + c) ] = 0

Since sqrt(13) is not zero, the term in brackets must be zero:

(sqrt(10)*(b*c)/13) - sqrt(3)*(b + c) = 0

Multiply both sides by 13:

sqrt(10)*(b*c) - 13*sqrt(3)*(b + c) = 0

Hmm, this is one equation, but I have three variables: a, b, c. I need more relations to solve for b and c.

Let me think about other relations in the triangle.

First, the semi-perimeter s = (a + b + c)/2.

Area = r*s = 6*s.

Also, the area can be expressed using the formula (a*b*c)/(4R) = (a*b*c)/(4*13) = (a*b*c)/52.

So, 6*s = (a*b*c)/52.

Therefore, 6*s = (a*b*c)/52 => a*b*c = 6*52*s = 312*s.

Hmm, not sure if that's helpful yet.

Another formula: In any triangle, the distance between the inradius and the circumradius is OI = sqrt(R(R - 2r)).

We used that earlier to find OI = sqrt(13). But maybe that's already been used.

Wait, perhaps using the formula that relates the sides with the inradius and the exradius. Alternatively, maybe using the formula for the tangent of half-angle.

Wait, from earlier, we have sin(A/2) = sqrt(39)/13 and cos(A/2) = sqrt(130)/13.

We also know that tan(A/2) = sin(A/2)/cos(A/2) = (sqrt(39)/13)/(sqrt(130)/13) = sqrt(39/130) = sqrt(3/10).

Simplify sqrt(3/10) = sqrt(30)/10.

So, tan(A/2) = sqrt(30)/10.

I remember that tan(A/2) = (r)/(s - a), where s is the semi-perimeter and a is the side opposite angle A, which is BC in this case.

So, tan(A/2) = r / (s - a) = sqrt(30)/10.

So,

r / (s - a) = sqrt(30)/10

Given that r = 6,

6 / (s - a) = sqrt(30)/10

Therefore,

s - a = 60 / sqrt(30) = (60*sqrt(30))/30 = 2*sqrt(30)

So, s - a = 2*sqrt(30)

But s = (a + b + c)/2, so s - a = (-a + b + c)/2 = (b + c - a)/2 = 2*sqrt(30)

So,

(b + c - a)/2 = 2*sqrt(30)
=> b + c - a = 4*sqrt(30)
=> a = b + c - 4*sqrt(30)

So, that's another equation relating the sides.

Now, let's recap the equations we have:

1. From the angle bisector length:

sqrt(10)*(b*c) - 13*sqrt(3)*(b + c) = 0

2. From the tangent of half-angle:

a = b + c - 4*sqrt(30)

We also know that the sides a, b, c satisfy the triangle's other properties, such as the Law of Sines.

Law of Sines: a / sin A = 2R = 26.

So, a = 26 sin A

Similarly, b = 26 sin B and c = 26 sin C.

But perhaps we can express sin A in terms of sin(A/2) or cos(A/2).

We have sin A = 2 sin(A/2) cos(A/2) = 2*(sqrt(39)/13)*(sqrt(130)/13) = 2*(sqrt(39*130))/(13^2)

Compute sqrt(39*130): 39*130 = 5070, sqrt(5070). Hmm, 5070 factors as 5070 = 10*507 = 10*3*169 = 10*3*13^2. So sqrt(5070) = sqrt(10*3*13^2) = 13*sqrt(30).

So, sin A = 2*(13*sqrt(30))/(13^2) )= 2*sqrt(30)/13

Therefore, sin A = 2*sqrt(30)/13.

Thus, a = 26 sin A = 26*(2*sqrt(30)/13) = 4*sqrt(30)

So, a = 4*sqrt(30). But from the earlier equation, a = b + c - 4*sqrt(30). Therefore,

4*sqrt(30) = b + c - 4*sqrt(30)
=> b + c = 8*sqrt(30)

So, now we have that b + c = 8*sqrt(30). Let me note that down.

Now, going back to equation 1:

sqrt(10)*(b*c) - 13*sqrt(3)*(b + c) = 0

We know that b + c = 8*sqrt(30), so plugging that in:

sqrt(10)*(b*c) - 13*sqrt(3)*(8*sqrt(30)) = 0

Compute 13*sqrt(3)*8*sqrt(30):

13*8 = 104

sqrt(3)*sqrt(30) = sqrt(90) = 3*sqrt(10)

So, 104 * 3*sqrt(10) = 312*sqrt(10)

So, equation becomes:

sqrt(10)*(b*c) - 312*sqrt(10) = 0

Divide both sides by sqrt(10):

b*c - 312 = 0 => b*c = 312

But wait, b*c is exactly what we're supposed to find, AB * AC. So, AB * AC = b * c = 312.

Wait, so is the answer 312?

Let me double-check my steps.

We started with the condition that IA is perpendicular to OI. From that, we found OI = sqrt(13) using the formula OI = sqrt(R(R-2r)).

Then, using Pythagoras in triangle IOA, we found IA = 2*sqrt(39).

Then, we used the formula for the length of the angle bisector IA, which involved cos(A/2). We found cos(A/2) and sin(A/2).

From there, we found tan(A/2) and used the formula tan(A/2) = r/(s - a), leading us to find s - a = 2*sqrt(30), and hence a = b + c - 4*sqrt(30).

Then, using the Law of Sines, we found a = 4*sqrt(30), so b + c = 8*sqrt(30).

Plugging back into the angle bisector equation, we found bc = 312.

So, all steps seem to flow logically and correctly.

I think I can confidently say that the product AB * AC is 312.

To solve the problem, we start by noting that the distance between the incenter \( I \) and circumcenter \( O \) is given by \( OI = \sqrt{R(R - 2r)} \), where \( R \) is the circumradius and \( r \) is the inradius. Substituting the given values \( R = 13 \) and \( r = 6 \), we find:

\[
OI = \sqrt{13(13 - 2 \times 6)} = \sqrt{13 \times 1} = \sqrt{13}
\]

Since \( \overline{IA} \perp \overline{OI} \), triangle \( IOA \) is right-angled at \( I \). Using the Pythagorean theorem:

\[
OA^2 = OI^2 + IA^2 \implies 13^2 = (\sqrt{13})^2 + IA^2 \implies 169 = 13 + IA^2 \implies IA^2 = 156 \implies IA = 2\sqrt{39}
\]

The length \( IA \) can be expressed as \( IA = \frac{r}{\sin(A/2)} \). Substituting \( IA = 2\sqrt{39} \) and \( r = 6 \):

\[
2\sqrt{39} = \frac{6}{\sin(A/2)} \implies \sin(A/2) = \frac{3}{\sqrt{39}} = \frac{\sqrt{39}}{13}
\]

Using the identity \( \sin^2(A/2) + \cos^2(A/2) = 1 \), we find:

\[
\cos^2(A/2) = 1 - \left(\frac{\sqrt{39}}{13}\right)^2 = \frac{130}{169} \implies \cos(A/2) = \frac{\sqrt{130}}{13}
\]

The tangent of half-angle \( A \) is:

\[
\tan(A/2) = \frac{\sin(A/2)}{\cos(A/2)} = \frac{\sqrt{39}/13}{\sqrt{130}/13} = \frac{\sqrt{39}}{\sqrt{130}} = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{\sqrt{10}} = \frac{\sqrt{30}}{10}
\]

Using the formula \( \tan(A/2) = \frac{r}{s - a} \), where \( s \) is the semi-perimeter and \( a \) is the side opposite angle \( A \):

\[
\frac{\sqrt{30}}{10} = \frac{6}{s - a} \implies s - a = \frac{60}{\sqrt{30}} = 2\sqrt{30}
\]

Thus, \( a = b + c - 4\sqrt{30} \). Using the Law of Sines, \( a = 2R \sin A \). We find \( \sin A = 2 \sin(A/2) \cos(A/2) = \frac{2\sqrt{30}}{13} \), so:

\[
a = 26 \times \frac{2\sqrt{30}}{13} = 4\sqrt{30}
\]

Substituting back, \( 4\sqrt{30} = b + c - 4\sqrt{30} \implies b + c = 8\sqrt{30} \). Using the angle bisector length formula:

\[
2\sqrt{39} = \frac{2bc \cos(A/2)}{b + c} \implies \sqrt{39}(b + c) = \frac{bc \sqrt{130}}{13}
\]

Substituting \( b + c = 8\sqrt{30} \):

\[
\sqrt{39} \times 8\sqrt{30} = \frac{bc \sqrt{130}}{13} \implies bc = 312
\]

Thus, the product \( AB \cdot AC = bc = 312 \).

\[
\boxed{312}
\]
