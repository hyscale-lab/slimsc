Okay, so I have this problem about a tetrahedron ABCD. The edges are given in pairs: AB and CD are both sqrt(41), AC and BD are sqrt(80), and BC and AD are sqrt(89). I'm supposed to find the distance from the incenter I to each face, which is the same for all faces. The answer needs to be in the form m*sqrt(n)/p, where m, n, p are positive integers, m and p are coprime, and n is square-free. Then find m + n + p.

Hmm, first, since all the opposite edges are equal, this must be a kind of "isohedral" tetrahedron or maybe a "kite tetrahedron"? I'm not exactly sure of the term, but it seems symmetrical in some way. Because opposite edges are equal, maybe it's possible to compute its volume and inradius.

Wait, the inradius of a tetrahedron is the radius of the inscribed sphere that is tangent to all four faces. The formula for the inradius r is 3V / S, where V is the volume and S is the total surface area. So I need to find the volume V and the total surface area S of the tetrahedron.

But how do I find the volume? Maybe I can use coordinates to model the tetrahedron. Let me assign coordinates to the points such that it's easier to compute.

Let me think. Since opposite edges are equal, perhaps the tetrahedron is symmetric in some way, which could allow me to position it in a coordinate system.

Let’s try placing the points symmetrically. Maybe place point A at (a, b, c), point B at (-a, -b, c), point C at (-a, b, -c), and point D at (a, -b, -c). This way, the opposite edges would have the same lengths. Let me check:

AB would be the distance between (a,b,c) and (-a,-b,c). So AB = sqrt[(2a)^2 + (2b)^2 + 0^2] = sqrt(4a² + 4b²) = 2*sqrt(a² + b²). Similarly, CD is between (-a,b,-c) and (a,-b,-c). So CD = sqrt[(2a)^2 + (2b)^2 + 0^2] = 2*sqrt(a² + b²). So AB = CD, which matches the given.

Similarly, AC is between (a,b,c) and (-a,b,-c). That distance is sqrt[(2a)^2 + 0 + (2c)^2] = 2*sqrt(a² + c²). BD is between (-a,-b,c) and (a,-b,-c). That's sqrt[(2a)^2 + 0 + (2c)^2] = 2*sqrt(a² + c²). So AC = BD, which also matches.

Lastly, BC is between (-a,-b,c) and (-a,b,-c). The distance is sqrt[0 + (2b)^2 + (2c)^2] = 2*sqrt(b² + c²). Similarly, AD is between (a,b,c) and (a,-b,-c). That's sqrt[0 + (2b)^2 + (2c)^2] = 2*sqrt(b² + c²). So BC = AD, which is also given.

So this coordinate system works. Now, according to the problem, AB = sqrt(41). So AB = 2*sqrt(a² + b²) = sqrt(41). So 4(a² + b²) = 41. Similarly, AC = sqrt(80), which is 2*sqrt(a² + c²) = sqrt(80). So 4(a² + c²) = 80. And BC = sqrt(89), which is 2*sqrt(b² + c²) = sqrt(89). So 4(b² + c²) = 89.

So now I have three equations:

1. 4(a² + b²) = 41 → a² + b² = 41/4
2. 4(a² + c²) = 80 → a² + c² = 80/4 = 20
3. 4(b² + c²) = 89 → b² + c² = 89/4

Now, I can solve for a², b², c².

From equation 1: a² + b² = 41/4
From equation 2: a² + c² = 20
From equation 3: b² + c² = 89/4

Let me subtract equation 1 from equation 2: (a² + c²) - (a² + b²) = 20 - 41/4 → c² - b² = (80/4 - 41/4) = 39/4.

But from equation 3: b² + c² = 89/4. So now I have:

c² - b² = 39/4
c² + b² = 89/4

I can add these two equations: 2c² = (39 + 89)/4 = 128/4 = 32 → c² = 16 → c = 4 or -4.

Then, from c² = 16, plug into equation 2: a² + 16 = 20 → a² = 4 → a = 2 or -2.

From equation 1: a² + b² = 41/4. Since a² is 4, b² = 41/4 - 4 = 41/4 - 16/4 = 25/4 → b = 5/2 or -5/2.

So now, I have a²=4, b²=25/4, c²=16. So a=2, b=5/2, c=4. Or any combination with signs, but since I can choose the coordinate system, maybe assign a, b, c positive for simplicity.

So points are:

A: (2, 5/2, 4)
B: (-2, -5/2, 4)
C: (-2, 5/2, -4)
D: (2, -5/2, -4)

Wait, let me check that. Wait, earlier I thought of points as:

A: (a, b, c)
B: (-a, -b, c)
C: (-a, b, -c)
D: (a, -b, -c)

So with a=2, b=5/2, c=4. So points are:

A: (2, 5/2, 4)
B: (-2, -5/2, 4)
C: (-2, 5/2, -4)
D: (2, -5/2, -4)

Yes, correct.

Now, to compute the volume of the tetrahedron. The formula for the volume of a tetrahedron given coordinates can be found using the scalar triple product.

The volume is | (AB · (AC × AD)) | / 6.

Wait, let me write down the vectors.

First, let's compute vectors AB, AC, AD.

Point A is (2, 5/2, 4)
Point B is (-2, -5/2, 4)
Point C is (-2, 5/2, -4)
Point D is (2, -5/2, -4)

Vectors from A:

Vector AB = B - A = (-2 - 2, -5/2 - 5/2, 4 - 4) = (-4, -5, 0)
Vector AC = C - A = (-2 - 2, 5/2 - 5/2, -4 - 4) = (-4, 0, -8)
Vector AD = D - A = (2 - 2, -5/2 - 5/2, -4 -4) = (0, -5, -8)

Now, calculate the cross product AC × AD first.

AC × AD = |i   j   k|
             -4   0   -8
              0   -5   -8

So determinant:

i*(0*(-8) - (-5)*(-8)) - j*(-4*(-8) - 0*(-8)) + k*(-4*(-5) - 0*0)

Compute each component:

i: 0*(-8) = 0; (-5)*(-8)=40 → 0 - 40 = -40 → i*(-40)
j: - [ (-4)*(-8) - 0*(-8) ] = - [32 - 0] = -32 → j*(-32)
k: (-4)*(-5) - 0*0 = 20 → k*20

So AC × AD = (-40, -32, 20)

Now, compute AB · (AC × AD)

AB is (-4, -5, 0)
Dot product with (-40, -32, 20):

= (-4)*(-40) + (-5)*(-32) + 0*20
= 160 + 160 + 0 = 320

So the volume is |320| / 6 = 320/6 = 160/3.

Wait, that seems a bit large. Let me check the calculations.

Wait, cross product AC × AD:

i component: (0*(-8) - (-5)*(-8)) = 0 - 40 = -40
j component: - [ (-4*(-8) - 0*(-8)) ] = - [32 - 0] = -32
k component: (-4*(-5) - 0*0) =20 -0=20

So, yes, cross product is (-40, -32,20).

Then dot product with AB (-4, -5, 0):

(-4)(-40)=160; (-5)(-32)=160; 0*20=0. Sum is 320.

So volume is 320/6 = 160/3. Hmm, okay.

Alternatively, maybe I should compute the volume using another method to verify.

Wait, another way to compute volume is by using the Cayley-Menger determinant.

The formula is:

V = sqrt( | CM | / 288 ), where CM is the determinant of the Cayley-Menger matrix.

The Cayley-Menger matrix for four points in 3D space is a 5x5 matrix:

[0   1   1   1   1]
[1   0  AB² AC² AD²]
[1  AB² 0  BC² BD²]
[1  AC² BC² 0  CD²]
[1  AD² BD² CD² 0]

So let's fill this matrix.

Given AB = sqrt(41), so AB²=41
AC = sqrt(80), AC²=80
AD = sqrt(89), AD²=89
BC = sqrt(89), BC²=89
BD = sqrt(80), BD²=80
CD = sqrt(41), CD²=41

So the matrix is:

Row 0: 0, 1, 1, 1, 1
Row 1: 1, 0, 41, 80, 89
Row 2: 1, 41, 0, 89, 80
Row 3: 1, 80, 89, 0, 41
Row 4: 1, 89, 80, 41, 0

Wait, let me make sure:

Row 0: 0, 1, 1, 1, 1
Row 1: 1, 0, AB², AC², AD² → 1,0,41,80,89
Row 2: 1, AB², 0, BC², BD² → 1,41,0,89,80
Row 3: 1, AC², BC², 0, CD² → 1,80,89,0,41
Row 4: 1, AD², BD², CD², 0 → 1,89,80,41,0

Yes, correct.

Now, compute the determinant of this matrix.

The determinant is going to be a bit complicated, but maybe there's a pattern or symmetry here.

The Cayley-Menger determinant for four points in 3D is given by:

|0 1 1 1 1|
|1 0 a² b² c²|
|1 a² 0 d² e²|
|1 b² d² 0 f²|
|1 c² e² f² 0|

Where a, b, c, d, e, f are the edge lengths.

The determinant is:

- Let's denote the determinant as CM.

The formula is:

CM = 288 V² = determinant.

So determinant = 288*(160/3)^2 = 288*(25600/9) = 288*25600 /9

Wait, but maybe it's better to compute the determinant directly.

Alternatively, maybe I can compute it using expansion.

But computing a 5x5 determinant manually is tedious, but perhaps feasible with some symmetry.

Alternatively, since the tetrahedron has opposite edges equal, maybe the Cayley-Menger determinant can be simplified.

Wait, but perhaps I should trust the first calculation of the volume as 160/3. Let's proceed with that for now.

So, Volume V = 160/3.

Next, I need the total surface area S. Since all faces are congruent? Wait, no, the face areas might not be congruent because the edges are different.

Wait, but let me check: the tetrahedron has four triangular faces. Each face is a triangle with sides given by the edges of the tetrahedron.

So each face is a triangle. Let me compute the area of each face and sum them up.

Wait, but perhaps all the faces are congruent? Let's see.

Wait, the opposite edges are equal, but that doesn't necessarily imply the faces are congruent. Let me check.

Take face ABC: edges AB, BC, AC. AB = sqrt(41), BC = sqrt(89), AC = sqrt(80). Similarly, face ABD: edges AB, BD, AD. AB = sqrt(41), BD = sqrt(80), AD = sqrt(89). So face ABC has sides sqrt(41), sqrt(89), sqrt(80), same as ABD. Similarly, faces ACD and BCD will have the same edge lengths. So all four faces are congruent triangles. So each face is a triangle with sides sqrt(41), sqrt(80), sqrt(89).

Wait, that's interesting. So all four faces are congruent. So their areas are equal. Therefore, total surface area S is 4 times the area of one face.

So, I can compute the area of one face, say triangle ABC, and multiply by 4.

So, to compute the area of triangle ABC, I can use Heron's formula.

First, compute the semi-perimeter s = (sqrt(41) + sqrt(80) + sqrt(89)) / 2.

But Heron's formula might get messy with square roots. Alternatively, since I have the coordinates of the points, perhaps I can compute the area using the cross product.

Wait, points A, B, C have coordinates:

A: (2, 5/2, 4)
B: (-2, -5/2, 4)
C: (-2, 5/2, -4)

Compute vectors AB and AC, then find the cross product.

Wait, earlier I computed vectors AB and AC. Vector AB is (-4, -5, 0), vector AC is (-4, 0, -8).

The cross product AB × AC is:

|i   j   k|
|-4  -5   0|
|-4   0   -8|

Which is i*( (-5)(-8) - 0*0 ) - j*( (-4)(-8) - 0*(-4) ) + k*( (-4)(0) - (-5)(-4) )

So:

i*(40 - 0) - j*(32 - 0) + k*(0 - 20) → (40, -32, -20)

The magnitude of this vector is sqrt(40² + (-32)^2 + (-20)^2) = sqrt(1600 + 1024 + 400) = sqrt(3024).

Simplify sqrt(3024). Let's factor 3024:

Divide by 16: 3024 /16=189. So 3024=16*189.

189=9*21=9*3*7. So 3024=16*9*3*7= (4²)(3²)(3)(7). So sqrt(3024)=4*3*sqrt(3*7)=12*sqrt(21).

Thus, the area of triangle ABC is (1/2)*12*sqrt(21) = 6*sqrt(21).

Wait, but let me check the cross product again.

Wait, the cross product AB × AC is (40, -32, -20). The magnitude squared is 40² + (-32)^2 + (-20)^2 = 1600 + 1024 + 400 = 3024.

Wait, 40² is 1600, 32² is 1024, 20² is 400. So 1600 + 1024 = 2624; 2624 + 400 = 3024. Yes, correct.

sqrt(3024). Let me compute 3024:

3024 divided by 144 is 21. Because 144 * 21 = 3024. So sqrt(3024) = sqrt(144 * 21) = 12*sqrt(21). So yes, correct.

So the area is 12*sqrt(21)/2 = 6*sqrt(21).

Therefore, each face has area 6*sqrt(21), and the total surface area S = 4*6*sqrt(21) = 24*sqrt(21).

Wait, that seems manageable.

So now, the inradius r is 3V / S.

V is 160/3, S is 24*sqrt(21).

So:

r = (3*(160/3)) / (24*sqrt(21)) = (160) / (24*sqrt(21)) = (160)/(24*sqrt(21)).

Simplify this fraction:

Divide numerator and denominator by 8: 160/8=20; 24/8=3.

So r=20/(3*sqrt(21)).

Rationalize the denominator: multiply numerator and denominator by sqrt(21):

r=20*sqrt(21)/(3*21) = 20*sqrt(21)/(63).

Simplify 20 and 63 have no common factors (since 20 is 2^2 *5, 63 is 7*3^2), so it's reduced.

So r=20*sqrt(21)/63.

But the problem says the distance can be written as m*sqrt(n)/p, with m and p coprime, n square-free.

Here, m=20, n=21, p=63. But wait, are 20 and 63 coprime? 20 factors are 2^2*5, 63 is 7*3^2. No common factors, so yes.

Is n=21 square-free? 21 factors into 3*7, both primes. So yes, square-free.

So the distance is 20*sqrt(21)/63. So m=20, n=21, p=63.

So m + n + p = 20 + 21 + 63 = 104.

Wait, but let me double-check my volume and surface area calculations.

Earlier, using coordinates, I found the volume as 160/3, and the surface area as 24*sqrt(21). Then r is 3V/S = 3*(160/3)/(24*sqrt(21)) = 160/(24*sqrt(21)) = 20/(3*sqrt(21)) = 20*sqrt(21)/63. So yes.

Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the surface area.

Wait, each face is a triangle with area 6*sqrt(21), but let me check that.

Using Heron's formula, perhaps.

Given a triangle with sides a=sqrt(41), b=sqrt(80), c=sqrt(89).

Compute semi-perimeter s = (sqrt(41) + sqrt(80) + sqrt(89))/2.

Compute area = sqrt[ s(s-a)(s-b)(s-c) ].

But this looks messy. Alternatively, maybe using vectors again.

Wait, alternative method: Compute area using vectors.

From point A, vectors AB and AC.

Area is (1/2)|AB × AC|.

Earlier, I computed AB × AC as (40, -32, -20), which had magnitude 12*sqrt(21). So area is 6*sqrt(21). So that seems correct.

Alternatively, let's compute Heron's formula numerically to check.

Compute the sides:

sqrt(41) ≈ 6.4031,

sqrt(80) ≈ 8.9443,

sqrt(89) ≈ 9.4336.

s = (6.4031 + 8.9443 + 9.4336)/2 ≈ (24.780)/2 ≈ 12.39.

Compute s - a ≈ 12.39 - 6.4031 ≈ 5.9869,

s - b ≈ 12.39 - 8.9443 ≈ 3.4457,

s - c ≈ 12.39 - 9.4336 ≈ 2.9564.

Compute s*(s-a)*(s-b)*(s-c) ≈ 12.39 *5.9869 *3.4457 *2.9564.

Compute step by step:

12.39 *5.9869 ≈ 74.16,

3.4457 *2.9564 ≈ 10.17.

Then 74.16 *10.17 ≈ 754.13.

So sqrt(754.13) ≈ 27.47.

Which is approximately 6*sqrt(21) ≈ 6*4.5837 ≈27.502, which is close. So the area is correct.

Hence, yes, each face is 6*sqrt(21), so total surface area is 24*sqrt(21). So S=24*sqrt(21).

So r = 3V/S = 3*(160/3)/(24*sqrt(21)) = (160)/(24*sqrt(21)) = (20)/(3*sqrt(21)) = (20*sqrt(21))/63.

Yes, so the distance is 20*sqrt(21)/63. So m=20, n=21, p=63. Sum is 20+21+63=104.

Wait, but I thought the inradius formula was r = 3V / S. Wait a second, no, in 3D, the formula is volume = (1/3)*base area * height, but for the inradius, which is the radius of the inscribed sphere, the formula is V = (1/3)*r * S, where S is the total surface area.

So, V = (1/3)*r*S → r = 3V / S.

Yes, so that's correct. So r = 3*(160/3)/(24*sqrt(21)) = 160/(24*sqrt(21)).

Which simplifies as before.

So, I think that's correct.

**Final Answer**
The value of $m+n+p$ is $\boxed{104}$.


--- Final Answer Content ---


Given a tetrahedron \(ABCD\) with edges \(AB = CD = \sqrt{41}\), \(AC = BD = \sqrt{80}\), and \(BC = AD = \sqrt{89}\), we need to find the distance from the incenter \(I\) to each face, which is the same for all faces. This distance can be written in the form \(\frac{m \sqrt{n}}{p}\), where \(m\), \(n\), and \(p\) are positive integers, \(m\) and \(p\) are relatively prime, and \(n\) is not divisible by the square of any prime. We then find \(m + n + p\).

First, we assign coordinates to the vertices of the tetrahedron such that the opposite edges are equal. The coordinates are:
- \(A: (2, \frac{5}{2}, 4)\)
- \(B: (-2, -\frac{5}{2}, 4)\)
- \(C: (-2, \frac{5}{2}, -4)\)
- \(D: (2, -\frac{5}{2}, -4)\)

Using these coordinates, we compute the vectors and the cross product to find the volume \(V\) of the tetrahedron. The volume is calculated using the scalar triple product:
\[ V = \frac{1}{6} \left| \vec{AB} \cdot (\vec{AC} \times \vec{AD}) \right| \]
This results in the volume \(V = \frac{160}{3}\).

Next, we compute the total surface area \(S\). Each face of the tetrahedron is a triangle with sides \(\sqrt{41}\), \(\sqrt{80}\), and \(\sqrt{89}\). Using the cross product method, the area of one face is found to be \(6\sqrt{21}\). Since all four faces are congruent, the total surface area is:
\[ S = 4 \times 6\sqrt{21} = 24\sqrt{21} \]

The inradius \(r\) is given by the formula:
\[ r = \frac{3V}{S} \]
Substituting the values of \(V\) and \(S\):
\[ r = \frac{3 \times \frac{160}{3}}{24\sqrt{21}} = \frac{160}{24\sqrt{21}} = \frac{20}{3\sqrt{21}} = \frac{20\sqrt{21}}{63} \]

Thus, the distance from the incenter to each face is \(\frac{20\sqrt{21}}{63}\). The values \(m = 20\), \(n = 21\), and \(p = 63\) give us \(m + n + p = 20 + 21 + 63 = 104\).

The final answer is:
\[
\boxed{104}
\]
