Okay, so I have this geometry problem about a tetrahedron. Let me make sure I understand the problem correctly. 

We have a tetrahedron ABCD with the following edge lengths: AB and CD are both sqrt(41), AC and BD are sqrt(80), and BC and AD are sqrt(89). There's a point I inside the tetrahedron such that the distances from I to each of the four faces are all equal. I need to find this distance, which is given in the form m√n / p, where m, n, p are positive integers, m and p are coprime, and n is square-free. Then, compute m + n + p.

Hmm, okay. So, first, I recall that in a tetrahedron, a point equidistant from all four faces is called the incenter, similar to the incenter of a triangle. The distance from the incenter to each face is the inradius. So, I need to find the inradius of this tetrahedron.

I remember that the formula for the inradius (r) of a tetrahedron is given by r = (3V) / S, where V is the volume of the tetrahedron and S is the total surface area (the sum of the areas of all four faces). 

So, the plan is to find the volume V and the total surface area S of the tetrahedron. Then, compute r as 3V/S.

First, let's find the surface area. Each face is a triangle, and we know all the edge lengths, so we can find the area of each face using Heron's formula.

Wait, but before that, I should make sure I can find the areas of the four triangular faces. Let's list all the edges again:

AB = sqrt(41)
CD = sqrt(41)
AC = sqrt(80)
BD = sqrt(80)
BC = sqrt(89)
AD = sqrt(89)

So, let's see. The tetrahedron has edges AB, AC, AD, BC, BD, CD. Each pair of opposite edges are equal. AB = CD, AC = BD, BC = AD.

This seems symmetric. Maybe the tetrahedron is isohedral or something? Or maybe it's a kind of a symmetrical tetrahedron.

But perhaps I should just compute the areas of the four faces.

Wait, but hang on. Each face is a triangle with sides given by two of these edges. Let's see:

Faces are ABC, ABD, ACD, BCD.

Wait, each face is a triangle. For each face, I need the lengths of the three edges.

Let me list the faces:

1. Face ABC: edges AB, BC, AC. So, AB = sqrt(41), BC = sqrt(89), AC = sqrt(80)
2. Face ABD: edges AB, BD, AD. AB = sqrt(41), BD = sqrt(80), AD = sqrt(89)
3. Face ACD: edges AC, CD, AD. AC = sqrt(80), CD = sqrt(41), AD = sqrt(89)
4. Face BCD: edges BC, CD, BD. BC = sqrt(89), CD = sqrt(41), BD = sqrt(80)

So, each face is a triangle with sides sqrt(41), sqrt(80), sqrt(89). Wait, is that true? Let me check.

Face ABC: AB = sqrt(41), BC = sqrt(89), AC = sqrt(80). So, yes, sides sqrt(41), sqrt(80), sqrt(89).

Similarly, Face ABD: AB = sqrt(41), BD = sqrt(80), AD = sqrt(89). Same set.

Same for the other two faces. So, all four faces are congruent triangles, each with sides sqrt(41), sqrt(80), sqrt(89).

So, that's nice. So, each face has the same area, so the surface area S will be 4 times the area of one face.

So, if I can compute the area of one face, multiply by 4, and I have S.

So, let's compute the area of face ABC using Heron's formula.

First, compute the semi-perimeter, s = (a + b + c)/2.

a = sqrt(41), b = sqrt(80), c = sqrt(89).

s = (sqrt(41) + sqrt(80) + sqrt(89)) / 2.

But Heron's formula is sqrt[s(s - a)(s - b)(s - c)]. That looks complicated because of the square roots.

Wait, maybe there's a better way. Maybe the triangle is right-angled?

Let me check: is (sqrt(41))^2 + (sqrt(80))^2 equal to (sqrt(89))^2?

Compute 41 + 80 = 121. sqrt(121) is 11, but 89 is not 121. So, no. What about 41 + 89? 130, which is not 80. Or 80 + 89? 169, which is 13^2. Wait, 13^2 is 169. So, 80 + 89 is 169, which is 13^2. So, sqrt(80)^2 + sqrt(89)^2 = (sqrt(80))^2 + (sqrt(89))^2 = 80 + 89 = 169 = 13^2. So, that would mean that in the triangle with sides sqrt(80), sqrt(89), and sqrt(41), the side sqrt(41) is opposite the right angle? Wait, but 41 is not equal to 80 + 89. Wait, sorry, 80 + 89 is 169, which is 13^2. So, if we have a triangle with sides a, b, c, and a^2 + b^2 = c^2, then it's a right-angled triangle with c as the hypotenuse.

But in this case, the sides are sqrt(41), sqrt(80), sqrt(89). Let's compute the squares:

(sqrt(41))^2 = 41, (sqrt(80))^2 = 80, (sqrt(89))^2 = 89.

So, 41 + 80 = 121 = 11^2. But 11^2 is 121, which is not equal to 89. So, that's not the case. Alternatively, 41 + 89 = 130, which is not a perfect square. 80 + 89 = 169 = 13^2. So, in the triangle, the side opposite to the angle between sqrt(80) and sqrt(89) is sqrt(41). Hmm, wait. No. Wait, in a triangle, if a^2 + b^2 = c^2, then the side c is the hypotenuse. But in this case, 80 + 89 = 169, which is 13^2. So, that would mean that the side opposite to the angle between sqrt(80) and sqrt(89) is sqrt(169) = 13. But in our case, the third side is sqrt(41), not 13. So, this triangle is not right-angled. So, Heron's formula is the way to go.

Alternatively, maybe we can compute the area using vectors or coordinates? Hmm, but maybe that's more complicated.

Wait, another approach: if all edges are given, perhaps the tetrahedron is such that all opposite edges are equal, so it's a kind of isosceles tetrahedron. I think in such cases, the tetrahedron can be inscribed in a rectangular box, with edges aligned with the box's edges.

Wait, yes, I think there's a theorem about that. If a tetrahedron has all opposite edges equal, then it can be embedded in a box such that each edge corresponds to the space diagonal of a face of the box. So, maybe I can assign coordinates to the vertices such that each edge is a space diagonal.

Let me try that.

So, suppose we have a box with side lengths a, b, c. Then, the space diagonals are sqrt(a^2 + b^2 + c^2). But in our tetrahedron, opposite edges are sqrt(41), sqrt(80), sqrt(89). So, perhaps each pair of opposite edges corresponds to different space diagonals.

Wait, for the tetrahedron, the opposite edges are AB and CD, AC and BD, AD and BC. So, each pair of opposite edges has the same length.

So, perhaps each pair of opposite edges corresponds to different space diagonals of the box. So, AB, CD, AC, BD, AD, BC correspond to different space diagonals.

Wait, but in a box, there are four space diagonals, each of length sqrt(a^2 + b^2 + c^2). So, but here we have six edges, each being a space diagonal. Hmm, that might not work because a box only has four space diagonals. Hmm, perhaps that approach isn't directly applicable.

Wait, maybe not. Alternatively, perhaps the tetrahedron can fit into a cuboid such that each edge of the tetrahedron is a face diagonal of the cuboid. Hmm, that might be a way.

Wait, okay, let's think about it. If I can assign coordinates to the vertices A, B, C, D such that all the edges correspond to face diagonals of a cuboid.

So, let me try to assign coordinates.

Let me call the cuboid with edges x, y, z. Then, the face diagonals would be sqrt(x^2 + y^2), sqrt(y^2 + z^2), sqrt(z^2 + x^2).

But in our tetrahedron, the edges are sqrt(41), sqrt(80), sqrt(89). So, perhaps each pair (AB, CD), (AC, BD), (AD, BC) corresponds to these face diagonals.

So, for example, AB = sqrt(41) = sqrt(x^2 + y^2), CD = sqrt(41) = sqrt(y^2 + z^2). Similarly, AC = sqrt(80) = sqrt(x^2 + z^2), BD = sqrt(80) = sqrt(y^2 + x^2). Wait, that might not make sense.

Wait, maybe let's define the cuboid with edges a, b, c, and assign coordinates to the tetrahedron's vertices such that each edge of the tetrahedron is a face diagonal of the cuboid.

Let me think: place the points A, B, C, D at the opposite corners of the cuboid.

Wait, perhaps it's better to assign the coordinates as follows:

Let’s suppose that point A is at (0,0,0), and the other points are at (a,0,0), (0,b,0), (0,0,c), etc. But I think that might not directly work because the edges would be the edges of the cuboid, not the face diagonals.

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to arrange the tetrahedron such that each pair of opposite edges are face diagonals of the cuboid.

Wait, perhaps another strategy is to consider that if a tetrahedron has all opposite edges equal, it's called a disphenoid, and it's a tetrahedron where each pair of opposite edges are equal. So, in this case, it's a disphenoid.

And I remember that disphenoids can be embedded in a cuboid such that each edge is a face diagonal.

So, perhaps to assign coordinates to the vertices such that each edge is a face diagonal of a cuboid, and the opposite edges are the same.

Let me try to think of the cuboid. Let’s define the cuboid with edges of length x, y, z. Then, the face diagonals are sqrt(x^2 + y^2), sqrt(y^2 + z^2), sqrt(z^2 + x^2).

In our case, we have three pairs of opposite edges with lengths sqrt(41), sqrt(80), sqrt(89). So, perhaps each pair is assigned to one of these face diagonals.

So, let's set:

sqrt(x^2 + y^2) = sqrt(41)

sqrt(y^2 + z^2) = sqrt(80)

sqrt(z^2 + x^2) = sqrt(89)

So, we can write the equations:

x^2 + y^2 = 41 ...(1)

y^2 + z^2 = 80 ...(2)

z^2 + x^2 = 89 ...(3)

So, we have three equations with three variables x^2, y^2, z^2.

Let me denote a = x^2, b = y^2, c = z^2.

So,

a + b = 41 ...(1)

b + c = 80 ...(2)

c + a = 89 ...(3)

Now, let's solve this system.

From (1): a = 41 - b

From (2): c = 80 - b

Substitute into (3):

(80 - b) + (41 - b) = 89

80 + 41 - 2b = 89

121 - 2b = 89

So, 121 - 89 = 2b

32 = 2b => b = 16

Then, from (1): a = 41 - 16 = 25

From (2): c = 80 - 16 = 64

So, a = 25, b = 16, c = 64.

Therefore, x^2 = 25 => x =5

y^2 =16 => y=4

z^2=64 => z=8

So, the cuboid has sides 5, 4, 8.

Therefore, we can assign coordinates to the tetrahedron in this cuboid.

Let me assign the coordinates as follows:

Let’s place point A at (0,0,0)

Point B at (5,0,0) because AB is a face diagonal of the cuboid's front face (xy-plane). Wait, but in our case, AB is sqrt(41), which is sqrt(25 + 16) = sqrt(41), so AB is the diagonal of the face with sides 5 and 4.

Wait, actually, it's the space diagonal, but no, wait. Wait, AB is an edge of the tetrahedron, which is a face diagonal of the cuboid. So, AB is the diagonal of one face, CD is the diagonal of the opposite face.

Wait, perhaps it's better to define the points as follows:

Point A: (0,0,0)

Point B: (5,4,0) — because the edge AB is sqrt(5^2 + 4^2) = sqrt(41)

But then where would point C be?

Wait, perhaps point C is (5,0,8), so that AC is sqrt( (5-0)^2 + (0-0)^2 + (8-0)^2 ) = sqrt(25 + 64) = sqrt(89). But wait, AC should be sqrt(80). Hmm, that doesn't match.

Wait, maybe I need to adjust the coordinates.

Wait, perhaps another approach: since the cuboid has edges 5,4,8, the face diagonals are sqrt(5^2 +4^2)=sqrt(41), sqrt(4^2 +8^2)=sqrt(80), and sqrt(5^2 +8^2)=sqrt(89). So, these correspond to the face diagonals.

So, each edge of the tetrahedron is a face diagonal of the cuboid. So, AB is sqrt(41), which is the diagonal of the face with sides 5 and 4. Similarly, AC is sqrt(80), which is the diagonal of the face with sides 4 and 8, and AD is sqrt(89), the diagonal of the face with sides 5 and 8.

Wait, but how to assign the points? Maybe each pair of opposite edges is along opposite faces.

Alternatively, perhaps the tetrahedron is constructed such that each edge is a diagonal of a different face.

Let me try this:

Let me define the cuboid with opposite vertices at (0,0,0) and (5,4,8). Then, the face diagonals are:

- Front face (z=0): diagonal from (0,0,0) to (5,4,0): which is AB = sqrt(41)
- Top face (y=4): diagonal from (0,0,0) to (5,4,8): wait, that would be a space diagonal, not a face diagonal.
Wait, maybe not. Alternatively, perhaps:

Alternatively, think of the tetrahedron as having vertices at four of the eight vertices of the cuboid, such that each edge of the tetrahedron is a face diagonal.

Wait, another approach: In a cuboid, each pair of opposite edges (like AB and CD) can be the diagonals of opposite faces.

So, let's say AB is the diagonal of the front face (z=0), from (0,0,0) to (5,4,0). Then, CD is the diagonal of the back face (z=8), from (a, b,8) to (c, d,8). But wait, to make CD = sqrt(41), which is the same as AB, the face diagonal on the back face should also have length sqrt(41). So, the back face is 5x4, same as front face.

Wait, but in our cuboid, the back face (z=8) is 5x4 as well. So, CD should be the diagonal of that face, from (0,0,8) to (5,4,8). But then, CD would be the same as AB.

But that might not necessarily form a tetrahedron. Wait, but if we have four points: A(0,0,0), B(5,4,0), C(5,0,8), D(0,4,8). Then, let's compute the edges:

AB: distance from A to B: sqrt(5^2 +4^2 +0^2) = sqrt(41)

AC: distance from A to C: sqrt(5^2 +0^2 +8^2) = sqrt(25 +64) = sqrt(89)

AD: distance from A to D: sqrt(0^2 +4^2 +8^2) = sqrt(16 +64) = sqrt(80)

BC: distance from B to C: sqrt( (5-5)^2 + (0-4)^2 + (8-0)^2 ) = sqrt(0 + 16 +64) = sqrt(80)

BD: distance from B to D: sqrt( (0-5)^2 + (4-4)^2 + (8-0)^2 ) = sqrt(25 +0 +64) = sqrt(89)

CD: distance from C to D: sqrt( (0-5)^2 + (4-0)^2 + (8-8)^2 ) = sqrt(25 +16 +0) = sqrt(41)

Yes! So, this works. So, the four points are A(0,0,0), B(5,4,0), C(5,0,8), D(0,4,8). So, the edges are as required.

So, now that I have coordinates for all four points, I can compute the volume of the tetrahedron.

I remember that the volume of a tetrahedron given coordinates can be calculated using the scalar triple product. The formula is V = | (AB · (AC × AD)) | / 6.

So, let me compute vectors AB, AC, AD.

Wait, actually, points A, B, C, D are as follows:

A: (0,0,0)

B: (5,4,0)

C: (5,0,8)

D: (0,4,8)

So, vectors from A to B, A to C, A to D are:

AB = B - A = (5,4,0)

AC = C - A = (5,0,8)

AD = D - A = (0,4,8)

So, the vectors AB, AC, AD are (5,4,0), (5,0,8), (0,4,8).

Compute the cross product AC × AD first.

So, AC = (5, 0, 8)

AD = (0,4,8)

Cross product AC × AD is determinant of the matrix:

i    j    k
5    0    8
0    4    8

So, compute determinant:

i*(0*8 - 8*4) - j*(5*8 - 8*0) + k*(5*4 - 0*0)

= i*(0 -32) - j*(40 - 0) + k*(20 - 0)

= (-32, -40, 20)

So, AC × AD = (-32, -40, 20)

Now, compute AB · (AC × AD):

AB is (5,4,0)

Dot product with (-32, -40, 20):

= 5*(-32) + 4*(-40) + 0*20

= (-160) + (-160) + 0

= -320

So, the scalar triple product is -320. The absolute value is 320. So, volume V = | -320 | / 6 = 320 / 6 = 160 / 3.

So, the volume is 160/3.

Next, compute the surface area S. Since all four triangular faces are congruent, each has the same area. So, compute the area of one face and multiply by 4.

Let's compute the area of face ABC. The edges are AB, BC, AC, which are sqrt(41), sqrt(89), sqrt(80), but we can compute the area using vectors.

Alternatively, since all faces are congruent, and we have the edge lengths, we can use Heron's formula as we initially thought.

So, for face ABC, sides are a = sqrt(41), b = sqrt(80), c = sqrt(89).

Compute semi-perimeter s: (sqrt(41) + sqrt(80) + sqrt(89)) / 2.

But this seems messy, but perhaps we can find another way. Wait, given that we have coordinates for ABC, perhaps compute the area using vectors or coordinates.

Points A(0,0,0), B(5,4,0), C(5,0,8).

So, vectors AB = (5,4,0), AC = (5,0,8)

Compute the cross product AB × AC.

AB × AC = determinant:

i    j    k
5    4    0
5    0    8

= i*(4*8 - 0*0) - j*(5*8 - 0*5) + k*(5*0 -4*5)

= i*(32) - j*(40) + k*(-20)

= (32, -40, -20)

The magnitude of this vector is sqrt(32^2 + (-40)^2 + (-20)^2)

Compute 32^2 = 1024

40^2 = 1600

20^2 = 400

Total: 1024 + 1600 + 400 = 3024

sqrt(3024). Hmm, let's factor 3024.

3024 divided by 16 is 189. 189 is 9*21=9*3*7.

So, sqrt(3024) = sqrt(16 * 189) = 4 * sqrt(189)

But 189 = 9*21 = 9*3*7. So, sqrt(189) = 3*sqrt(21)

Thus, sqrt(3024) = 4 * 3 * sqrt(21) = 12 sqrt(21)

So, the magnitude of AB × AC is 12 sqrt(21). The area of triangle ABC is half of this: 6 sqrt(21).

So, the area of each face is 6 sqrt(21). Therefore, total surface area S = 4 * 6 sqrt(21) = 24 sqrt(21).

Now, compute the inradius r = (3V) / S.

V = 160/3, so 3V = 160.

S = 24 sqrt(21)

So, r = 160 / (24 sqrt(21)) = (160 / 24) / sqrt(21) = (20 / 3) / sqrt(21) = (20) / (3 sqrt(21)).

Rationalizing the denominator: multiply numerator and denominator by sqrt(21):

r = (20 sqrt(21)) / (3 * 21) = (20 sqrt(21)) / 63.

Simplify: 20 and 63 are coprime. 20 and 63 share no common factors besides 1.

So, r = (20 sqrt(21)) / 63.

So, m = 20, n = 21, p = 63.

Wait, but wait, 63 can be simplified with 20? No, because 20 factors are 2^2 *5; 63 is 7*3^2. No common factors. So, indeed, m and p are coprime.

Also, n = 21, which is 3*7, which is square-free, so that condition is satisfied.

So, the inradius is 20√21 / 63.

Thus, m + n + p = 20 + 21 + 63 = 104.

Wait, but hold on a second. Let me double-check the calculations, especially the surface area.

Wait, when I computed the cross product AB × AC, I got (32, -40, -20). The magnitude squared was 32^2 + (-40)^2 + (-20)^2 = 1024 + 1600 + 400 = 3024. sqrt(3024) is 12 sqrt(21), correct. So, area is 6 sqrt(21). So, each face is 6 sqrt(21), and four faces make 24 sqrt(21). So, S is correct.

Volume: computed as 160/3. Let me verify that.

Vectors AB = (5,4,0), AC = (5,0,8), AD = (0,4,8).

Compute cross product AC × AD: as above, (-32, -40, 20). Correct.

Dot product with AB: (5,4,0) · (-32, -40, 20) = 5*(-32) + 4*(-40) + 0*20 = -160 -160 + 0 = -320.

Absolute value is 320, volume is 320 / 6 = 160/3. Correct.

So, 3V = 160.

r = 160 / (24 sqrt(21)) = 20/(3 sqrt(21)) = 20 sqrt(21)/63.

Yes, all correct.

So, the answer is 20 + 21 + 63 = 104.

**Final Answer**
\boxed{104}


--- Final Answer Content ---


Given a tetrahedron \(ABCD\) with edge lengths \(AB = CD = \sqrt{41}\), \(AC = BD = \sqrt{80}\), and \(BC = AD = \sqrt{89}\), we need to find the distance from the incenter \(I\) to each face of the tetrahedron. This distance can be written in the form \(\frac{m \sqrt{n}}{p}\), where \(m\), \(n\), and \(p\) are positive integers, \(m\) and \(p\) are relatively prime, and \(n\) is square-free. We then compute \(m + n + p\).

First, we recognize that the tetrahedron is a disphenoid with all faces congruent. We use the coordinates of the vertices to compute the volume and surface area.

The vertices are assigned as follows:
- \(A(0,0,0)\)
- \(B(5,4,0)\)
- \(C(5,0,8)\)
- \(D(0,4,8)\)

We compute the volume using the scalar triple product. The vectors from \(A\) are:
- \(\overrightarrow{AB} = (5,4,0)\)
- \(\overrightarrow{AC} = (5,0,8)\)
- \(\overrightarrow{AD} = (0,4,8)\)

The cross product \(\overrightarrow{AC} \times \overrightarrow{AD}\) is calculated as:
\[
\overrightarrow{AC} \times \overrightarrow{AD} = \begin{vmatrix}
\mathbf{i} & \mathbf{j} & \mathbf{k} \\
5 & 0 & 8 \\
0 & 4 & 8
\end{vmatrix} = (-32, -40, 20)
\]

The dot product \(\overrightarrow{AB} \cdot (\overrightarrow{AC} \times \overrightarrow{AD})\) is:
\[
(5, 4, 0) \cdot (-32, -40, 20) = 5(-32) + 4(-40) + 0(20) = -160 - 160 = -320
\]

The volume \(V\) is:
\[
V = \frac{1}{6} | -320 | = \frac{320}{6} = \frac{160}{3}
\]

Next, we compute the surface area. Each face is a triangle with sides \(\sqrt{41}\), \(\sqrt{80}\), and \(\sqrt{89}\). Using Heron's formula, the area of one face is found using the cross product method:
\[
\text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \left| \overrightarrow{AB} \times \overrightarrow{AC} \right| = \frac{1}{2} \sqrt{3024} = 6\sqrt{21}
\]

The total surface area \(S\) is:
\[
S = 4 \times 6\sqrt{21} = 24\sqrt{21}
\]

The inradius \(r\) is given by:
\[
r = \frac{3V}{S} = \frac{3 \times \frac{160}{3}}{24\sqrt{21}} = \frac{160}{24\sqrt{21}} = \frac{20}{3\sqrt{21}} = \frac{20\sqrt{21}}{63}
\]

Thus, \(m = 20\), \(n = 21\), and \(p = 63\). Therefore, \(m + n + p = 20 + 21 + 63 = 104\).

\[
\boxed{104}
\]
