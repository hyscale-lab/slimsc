Okay, so I have this problem here: There exist real numbers x and y, both greater than 1, such that log base x of y^x equals 10, and log base y of x^{4y} also equals 10. I need to find the product xy.

Hmm, let me write down the given equations to make it clearer.

First equation: log_x(y^x) = 10.

Second equation: log_y(x^{4y}) = 10.

I remember some logarithm rules. The logarithm of a power can be rewritten by bringing the exponent in front. So, log_b(a^k) = k * log_b(a). So maybe I can apply that here.

Let's start with the first equation: log_x(y^x) = 10.

Applying the rule, this becomes x * log_x(y) = 10.

Wait, but log_x(y) is the logarithm of y with base x, which can be written as (ln y) / (ln x) if I switch to natural logs, but maybe I don't need to go that far yet.

So, let me denote log_x(y) as A. Then the first equation becomes x * A = 10.

Similarly, for the second equation: log_y(x^{4y}) = 10.

Again, using the same power rule, this becomes (4y) * log_y(x) = 10.

Wait, log_y(x) is the reciprocal of log_x(y), right? Because log_b(a) = 1 / log_a(b). So, log_y(x) = 1 / A.

So substituting that in, the second equation becomes 4y * (1/A) = 10.

So now, I have two equations:

1) x * A = 10.

2) (4y)/A = 10.

I can write this as:

Equation 1: x A = 10.

Equation 2: (4y) / A = 10.

Hmm, maybe I can solve for A from the first equation and substitute into the second.

From Equation 1: A = 10 / x.

Substitute A into Equation 2: (4y) / (10/x) ) = 10.

Simplify the denominator: 4y divided by (10/x) is the same as 4y * (x/10) ) = (4xy)/10.

So, (4xy)/10 = 10.

Multiply both sides by 10: 4xy = 100.

Divide both sides by 4: xy = 25.

Wait, that seems straightforward. So is xy equal to 25? Hmm, let me check my steps again to make sure I didn't make a mistake.

First equation: log_x(y^x) = 10 → x log_x(y) =10.

Let A = log_x(y) → x A =10. So A =10/x.

Second equation: log_y(x^{4y})=10 →4y log_y(x)=10.

But log_y(x) is 1/A, so 4y*(1/A)=10.

Substitute A=10/x: 4y*(x/10)=10 → (4xy)/10=10 → 4xy=100→ xy=25.

Wait, so that's correct. So the product xy is 25. Hmm, that seems right. But let me double-check by plugging back into the original logarithmic equations.

If xy=25, then let me pick some numbers to see if they satisfy the original equations. Wait, but I don't know x and y individually, just their product. Maybe I can express y in terms of x.

Since xy=25, y=25/x.

Let's go back to the first equation: log_x(y^x)=10.

Express y as 25/x: log_x( (25/x)^x )=10.

Simplify the inside: (25/x)^x = (25^x) / (x^x).

So log_x(25^x / x^x) = log_x(25^x) - log_x(x^x) = x log_x(25) - x.

Because log_x(a/b) = log_x(a) - log_x(b), and log_x(a^k)=k log_x(a).

So, x log_x(25) -x =10.

Factor out x: x [ log_x(25) -1 ] =10.

Hmm, that's a bit tricky, but maybe I can express log_x(25) in terms of A or something.

Wait, from earlier, we had A = log_x(y) = log_x(25/x).

Which is log_x(25) - log_x(x) = log_x(25) -1.

So, the first equation becomes x [ A ]=10, which is consistent with our previous result.

Alternatively, perhaps I can find x and y individually.

Let me try to solve for x and y.

We have two equations:

1) x A =10.

2) 4y / A =10.

And A= log_x(y)= log_x(25/x).

So from equation 1: A=10/x.

From equation 2: 4y=10A.

But y=25/x, so substituting that into equation 2:

4*(25/x) =10A → 100/x =10A → A=10/x.

Wait, that brings me back to the same place.

Alternatively, perhaps I can express log_x(y) in terms of ln or another base.

Since A = log_x(y) = (ln y)/(ln x), and from our earlier substitution, A=10/x.

So,

ln y / ln x =10/x.

But y=25/x, so:

ln(25/x) / ln x =10/x.

Simplify ln(25/x)= ln25 - lnx.

So,

(ln25 - lnx)/lnx =10/x.

Let me denote t = lnx. Then, lny = ln(25/x)= ln25 - lnx = ln25 - t.

So, (ln25 -t)/t =10/x.

But x= e^t, so 10/x =10 e^{-t}.

So, (ln25 - t)/t = 10 e^{-t}.

Hmm, this seems a bit complex. Let me see if I can make this equation manageable.

Multiply both sides by t:

ln25 - t =10 t e^{-t}.

Hmm, this is a transcendental equation and might not have a closed-form solution. Maybe I can look for integer solutions?

Wait, earlier I found that xy=25, which is 5^2. Maybe x and y are both 5? Let's check x=5, y=5.

First equation: log_5(5^5)= log_5(3125)=5. But the equation requires it to be 10. So 5≠10, so x=5, y=5 is not a solution.

Wait, that's not correct. Wait, log_x(y^x) when x=5 and y=5 would be log_5(5^5)=5. Which is not 10. So that doesn't work.

Hmm, maybe x and y are different. Let me see, perhaps if x=25, then y=1? But wait, y must be greater than 1. So y=1 is invalid.

Wait, another approach. Maybe let’s express both log equations in terms of same variables.

We have log_x(y^x)=10, which is x log_x(y)=10.

Similarly, log_y(x^{4y})=10, which is 4y log_y(x)=10.

But log_y(x)= 1 / log_x(y) =1/A.

So, 4y*(1/A)=10.

But from first equation, A=10/x, so 4y*(x/10)=10.

Which led us to 4xy=100 → xy=25, as before.

So, since the problem only asks for the product xy, which is 25, perhaps that's the answer. But let me just confirm.

Wait, another check: let's pick some x and y where xy=25, and see if they satisfy both equations.

For example, let’s pick x=2, then y=25/2=12.5.

Check first equation: log_2(12.5^2).

Compute 12.5^2=156.25.

log_2(156.25)= log2(128)=7, but 156.25 is larger than 128, so log2(156.25)= approx 7. something.

Wait, but 2^7=128, 2^7.3= approx 156.25?

Wait, 2^7=128, 2^7.2= about 128 * 2^0.2 ≈128 *1.1487≈146.87, 2^7.3=128 *2^0.3≈128 *1.231≈157.3, which is close to 156.25. So log2(156.25)≈7.3, which is not 10. So that doesn't work.

Hmm, so x=2 and y=12.5 don't satisfy the first equation.

Another example, x= sqrt(25)=5, y=5, which I already tried and didn't work.

Wait, perhaps x=25, y=1, but y must be greater than 1, so that's invalid.

Alternatively, x= 25^{1/3}= ~2.924, y=25/2.924≈8.55.

Let me compute log_x(y^x). So y^x= (8.55)^{2.924}.

Hmm, that's a big number. Let me see: 8.55^3≈624. So 8.55^2.924 is less than that, maybe around 500. Then log_x(500)= log(500)/log(x).

Wait, x=2.924, log base 2.924 of 500.

Wait, 2.924^5 is around 2.924^2=8.55, ^4≈73.1, ^5≈213.5. That's way less than 500. So log_x(500) would be higher than 5. Let's say it's around 6. But that's not 10. So this x and y don't satisfy the first equation either.

Hmm, perhaps the only way this works is if x and y are such that they satisfy both equations, but without knowing x and y individually, perhaps the product is sufficient, and the answer is 25.

Wait, the problem only asks for the product, not x and y individually, so maybe it's indeed 25.

But I'm a bit confused because I tried x=2, y=12.5 and it didn't satisfy the first condition, but perhaps I made a miscalculation.

Wait, earlier substitution led me to xy=25, so unless there's a mistake in substitution, that's the answer. Maybe I shouldn't overcomplicate it.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use another approach.

Let me try to express both logarithms in terms of natural logs.

First equation: log_x(y^x) = 10.

Which is (ln y^x)/(ln x) =10 → (x ln y)/(ln x)=10.

Second equation: log_y(x^{4y})=10 → (ln x^{4y})/(ln y) )=10 → (4y ln x)/(ln y)=10.

So now we have:

Equation 1: x ln y =10 ln x.

Equation 2: 4y ln x =10 ln y.

Hmm, let me write these as:

Equation 1: x ln y =10 ln x.

Equation 2:4y ln x =10 ln y.

Let me call Equation 1 as equation A and Equation 2 as equation B.

From equation A: x ln y =10 ln x → ln y = (10 ln x)/x.

From equation B: 4y ln x =10 ln y.

Substituting ln y from equation A into equation B:

4y ln x =10 * (10 ln x)/x.

Simplify: 4y ln x = (100 ln x)/x.

Assuming ln x ≠0 (since x>1, ln x>0), we can divide both sides by ln x:

4y = 100/x → y = (100)/(4x) =25/x.

So y=25/x → xy=25. That's consistent with the previous result.

So that's another way to get the same answer, so it must be correct.

Therefore, the product xy is 25.

The problem involves finding real numbers \(x\) and \(y\), both greater than 1, such that \(\log_x(y^x) = 10\) and \(\log_y(x^{4y}) = 10\). We aim to determine the product \(xy\).

First, we rewrite the logarithmic equations using logarithm properties:

1. \(\log_x(y^x) = 10\) becomes \(x \cdot \log_x(y) = 10\). Let \(A = \log_x(y)\), so \(x \cdot A = 10\).
2. \(\log_y(x^{4y}) = 10\) becomes \(4y \cdot \log_y(x) = 10\). Since \(\log_y(x) = \frac{1}{\log_x(y)} = \frac{1}{A}\), we substitute to get \(4y \cdot \frac{1}{A} = 10\).

From the first equation, \(A = \frac{10}{x}\). Substituting this into the second equation:

\[
\frac{4y}{\frac{10}{x}} = 10 \implies \frac{4xy}{10} = 10 \implies 4xy = 100 \implies xy = 25.
\]

Thus, the product \(xy\) is \(\boxed{25}\).
