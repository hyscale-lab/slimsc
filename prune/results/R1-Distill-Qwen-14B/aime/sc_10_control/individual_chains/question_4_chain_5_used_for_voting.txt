Okay, so I have this problem where Alice and Bob are playing a game with a stack of n tokens. They take turns removing either 1 or 4 tokens, and the person who takes the last token wins. I need to figure out how many positive integers n ≤ 2024 allow Bob to have a winning strategy, no matter how Alice plays.

Hmm, let me think. This seems like a combinatorial game theory problem. I remember that in such games, positions can be classified as winning or losing positions. A winning position means the current player can force a win no matter what the opponent does, while a losing position means the current player will lose if the opponent plays optimally.

So, in this case, the starting player is Alice, and Bob is the second player. We need to find the values of n where Bob can force a win, regardless of Alice's moves. That would mean that n is a losing position for Alice, so Bob can take advantage of that.

Let me try to model the game. Let's consider the possible moves and the resulting positions.

If a player is faced with 0 tokens, they lose because they can't make a move. So 0 is a losing position.

For n=1: Alice can take 1 token and win. So n=1 is a winning position for Alice, meaning it's a losing position for Bob.

n=2: Alice can take 1 token, leaving 1 for Bob. Bob can then take 1 and win. Wait, no, wait. Wait, if Alice takes 1, n=1 is left. Bob takes 1 and wins. So, if Alice can force Bob into a position where he can win, that's not good for her. Wait, but Alice goes first, so she wants to make a move that forces Bob into a losing position.

Wait, perhaps I should think recursively. Let me define the positions as either winning (W) or losing (L). The base case is n=0, which is losing because you can't move.

For n=1: You can take 1 token and win, so it's a winning position (W).

n=2: You can take 1 token, leaving 1 for the opponent, which is a W position. Wait, but if you leave the opponent with a W position, that's bad for you because they can win. Alternatively, can you take 4 tokens? No, because n=2 <4. So for n=2, you can only take 1 token, leaving 1 for the opponent. Since the opponent can win from 1, n=2 is a losing position for the current player. So n=2 is an L position.

Wait, no. Wait, the current player can take 1, leaving n=1 for the opponent. Since n=1 is a W position for the opponent, that means the current player can force the opponent into a W position, which is good for the current player. Wait no, that's the opposite. If I'm the current player at n=2, I can take 1, leaving n=1 for the opponent. If n=1 is a W position, that means the opponent can win from there. So n=2 is a losing position for me because whatever I do, the opponent can win. Wait, I'm getting confused.

Wait, let me get this straight. Let's use the standard definitions:

- A position is a losing position (L) if every possible move leads to a winning position (W) for the opponent.
- A position is a winning position (W) if there exists at least one move that leads to an L position for the opponent.

So, starting from n=0: it's an L position because you can't move.

n=1: You can take 1 token and win, so it's a W position.

n=2: The possible moves are taking 1 token, leaving n=1, which is a W for the opponent. Since all moves from n=2 lead to W positions for the opponent, n=2 is an L position.

n=3: You can take 1 token, leaving n=2 (which is L for the opponent). So, since there exists a move that leads to an L position, n=3 is a W position.

n=4: You can take 1 or 4 tokens. Taking 4 tokens leads to n=0, which is L for the opponent. So, n=4 is a W position.

n=5: Let's see. Possible moves: take 1, leaving n=4 (W); take 4, leaving n=1 (W). All moves lead to W positions for the opponent, so n=5 is L.

n=6: Take 1, leaving n=5 (L). So n=6 is W.

n=7: Take 1, leaves n=6 (W). Take 4, leaves n=3 (W). So all moves lead to W positions. So n=7 is L.

n=8: Take 1, leaves n=7 (L). So n=8 is W.

n=9: Take 1, leaves n=8 (W). Take 4, leaves n=5 (L). So since there's a move to L, n=9 is W.

n=10: Take 1, leaves n=9 (W). Take 4, leaves n=6 (W). So all moves lead to W, so n=10 is L.

Wait, I see a pattern here. Let me list these out:

n | Position
0 | L
1 | W
2 | L
3 | W
4 | W
5 | L
6 | W
7 | L
8 | W
9 | W
10| L
...

Looking at this, the losing positions seem to be at n=0, 2, 5, 7, 10, ...

Let me see the differences between these losing positions:

2-0=2; 5-2=3; 7-5=2; 10-7=3. So alternates between 2 and 3.

Is this a repeating cycle? Let's check n=11,12,13,14.

n=11: Can I move to a losing position?

Possible moves from 11: take 1 →10 (L!) So, n=11 is W.

Wait, if I take 1 from 11, I reach 10, which is an L. So n=11 is W.

n=12: Take 1 →11 (W). Take 4 →8 (W). So all moves lead to W. So n=12 is L.

n=13: Take 1 →12 (L). So n=13 is W.

n=14: Take 1 →13 (W). Take 4 →10 (L). So n=14 is W.

n=15: Take 1 →14 (W). Take4 →11 (W). So all moves lead to W. So n=15 is L.

Wait, so the losing positions are 0,2,5,7,10,12,15,... So the pattern is adding 2, then 3, then 2, then 3, etc.

So the losing positions are numbers congruent to 0,2,5,7,10,12,15,17,... modulo something.

Wait, let's see: 0,2,5,7,10,12,15,17,...

Let me see the differences:

From 0 to 2: +2

2 to5: +3

5 to7:+2

7 to10:+3

10 to12:+2

12 to15:+3

15 to17:+2

So it's an alternating pattern of adding 2 and 3.

So, the losing positions are every 2, then 3, then 2, then 3, etc.

So, the losing positions can be represented as:

Starting from 0, add 2, then 3, then 2, then 3, and so on.

So the sequence is 0, 2, 5, 7, 10, 12, 15, 17, 20, 22, 25, 27, etc.

Wait, what is the cycle here? It's adding 2 and 3 alternately. So each cycle is adding 5 (2+3), but the positions are every 2 and 3 alternately.

Alternatively, we can model this as a repeating pattern every 5 numbers.

Wait, let's check the losing positions:

The first few losing positions are at n=0,2,5,7,10,12,15,17,20,22,25,27, etc.

Looking at these numbers:

They can be expressed as:

0,

0 +2=2,

2 +3=5,

5 +2=7,

7 +3=10,

10 +2=12,

12 +3=15,

15 +2=17,

17 +3=20,

20 +2=22,

22 +3=25,

25 +2=27,

and so on.

So the pattern is every 2 and 3 added alternately.

But perhaps there's a way to represent these losing positions as numbers congruent to specific values modulo 5.

Looking at n:

0 mod5: 0,5,10,15,20,25 etc.

But wait, the losing positions are 0,2,5,7,10,12,15,17,20,22,25,27,...

So n=0 mod5: 0,5,10,15,20,25 etc. are losing positions.

n=2 mod5: 2,7,12,17,22,27 etc. are losing positions.

So, the losing positions are numbers congruent to 0 or 2 modulo5.

Wait, let's check:

n=0: yes,

n=2: yes,

n=5: 5 mod5=0: yes,

n=7: 7 mod5=2: yes,

n=10: 10 mod5=0: yes,

n=12:12 mod5=2: yes,

n=15:15 mod5=0: yes,

n=17:17 mod5=2: yes,

Yes, that seems to fit. So the losing positions are n≡0 or 2 mod5.

So, for any n, if n mod5 is 0 or 2, then it's a losing position.

Wait, but let me verify with n=1:

n=1: 1 mod5=1 → W, which is correct.

n=3: 3 mod5=3 → W, correct.

n=4:4 mod5=4 → W, correct.

n=6:6 mod5=1 → W, correct.

n=8:8 mod5=3 → W, correct.

n=9:9 mod5=4 → W, correct.

n=11:11 mod5=1 → W, correct.

n=13:13 mod5=3 → W, correct.

n=14:14 mod5=4 → W, correct.

n=16:16 mod5=1 → W, correct.

n=18:18 mod5=3 → W, correct.

n=19:19 mod5=4 → W, correct.

So, yes, all numbers not congruent to 0 or 2 mod5 are winning positions.

So, the losing positions are n≡0 or 2 mod5.

So, if Alice starts with n being a losing position, then Bob can win.

Wait, no. Wait, if n is a losing position, then the current player (Alice) cannot force a win. So Bob, as the second player, can win.

So, for n≡0 or 2 mod5, Alice has no winning strategy; Bob can win.

So, the question is, how many n ≤2024 satisfy n≡0 or 2 mod5.

So, we need to count the numbers ≤2024 that are ≡0 or 2 mod5.

Let me compute how many numbers ≤2024 are ≡0 mod5 and ≡2 mod5.

For mod5, each residue class has either floor(2024/5) or floor(2024/5)+1 numbers.

2024 divided by5 is 404.8. So, 404 full cycles, with a remainder of 4.

So for each residue:

Number of numbers ≡r mod5 is:

If r ≤4: for r=0,1,2,3,4.

Wait, 2024 =5*404 +4.

So for residues 0,1,2,3,4:

Residues 0: 404 +1 if the remainder includes 0? Wait, let me think.

Wait, the first number is 1, but for mod5, 0 is from 5,10,15,...

So, the count for n≡0 mod5: 2024//5=404 numbers (since 5*404=2020, and 2020+5=2025>2024).

Similarly, for n≡2 mod5: the numbers start at 2,7,12,... up to <=2024.

The last term is the largest number ≤2024 that ≡2 mod5.

2024 divided by5: 2024 =5*404 +4. So 5*404=2020. 2020 +2=2022. 2022 ≤2024. So 2022 is the last term for n≡2 mod5.

So the number of terms for n≡2 mod5 is (2022 -2)/5 +1= (2020)/5 +1=404 +1=405.

Wait, let me compute it step by step.

The first term for n≡2 mod5 is 2, the last term is 2022.

Number of terms is ((2022 -2)/5)+1= (2020/5)+1=404 +1=405.

Similarly, for n≡0 mod5: first term 5, last term 2020.

Number of terms: ((2020 -5)/5)+1= (2015/5)+1=403 +1=404.

So, total losing positions are 405 (for 2 mod5) +404 (for 0 mod5) =809.

But wait, let me double-check.

Wait, n runs from 1 to 2024.

Wait, but 0 is not included since n is positive integer. So n=0 is not part of the problem.

So, for n≡0 mod5: starting at 5,10,...2020. So numbers: (2020-5)/5 +1= (2015)/5 +1=403 +1=404.

n≡2 mod5: starting at 2,7,...2022. (2022-2)/5 +1=2020/5 +1=404 +1=405.

So total is 404 +405=809.

So the number of n ≤2024 where Bob can force a win is 809.

Wait, but let me confirm that 2022 is indeed ≤2024. Yes, 2022 is 2024-2.

So, that's correct.

So the answer is 809.

Wait, but just to make sure, let me compute total numbers:

Numbers congruent to 0 mod5: 404

Numbers congruent to 2 mod5:405

Total:809.

Which is less than 2024, which makes sense.

So, the number of positive integers n ≤2024 where Bob can guarantee a win is 809.


--- Final Answer Content ---


Alice and Bob play a game with a stack of $n$ tokens, taking turns to remove 1 or 4 tokens. The player who removes the last token wins. To determine the number of positive integers $n \leq 2024$ where Bob can guarantee a win, we analyze the game's winning and losing positions.

A position is losing if every possible move leads to a winning position for the opponent. Conversely, a position is winning if there exists at least one move that forces the opponent into a losing position. By examining small values of $n$, we identify the losing positions as those where $n \equiv 0 \text{ or } 2 \pmod{5}$.

To count the number of such $n \leq 2024$:
- Numbers $\equiv 0 \pmod{5}$: These are $5, 10, 15, \ldots, 2020$. There are $\frac{2020 - 5}{5} + 1 = 404$ such numbers.
- Numbers $\equiv 2 \pmod{5}$: These are $2, 7, 12, \ldots, 2022$. There are $\frac{2022 - 2}{5} + 1 = 405$ such numbers.

Adding these, we find there are $404 + 405 = 809$ losing positions where Bob can guarantee a win.

$\boxed{809}$
