Okay, so I have this math problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again carefully:

There's a list of positive integers with three properties:
1. The sum of all items is 30.
2. The unique mode is 9.
3. The median is a positive integer that doesn't appear in the list.

And I need to find the sum of the squares of all the items in the list.

Hmm, okay. Let's break this down.

First, let's recall some definitions to make sure I'm on the same page.

- **Sum**: The total when all items are added together. Here, it's 30.
- **Mode**: The number that appears most frequently. The unique mode is 9, meaning 9 appears more times than any other number, and no other number shares this highest frequency.
- **Median**: The middle value when the numbers are arranged in order. For a list with an odd number of elements, it's the middle one. For even, it's the average of the two middle ones. The problem states that the median is a positive integer not present in the list. So, the median must be an integer value, but it's not one of the numbers in the list.

Alright, so the list consists of positive integers, so all numbers are 1 or higher.

Let's think about the mode first. Since 9 is the unique mode, it must appear more times than any other number. So, if 9 appears 'k' times, all other numbers can appear at most 'k-1' times.

Now, let me try to figure out the possible structure of the list.

The median is a positive integer not in the list. So, for example, if the median is 8, then 8 isn't in the list. Or if it's 10, then 10 isn't in the list.

Let me consider the number of elements in the list. Let's denote n as the number of elements.

If n is odd, the median is the (n+1)/2-th term. If n is even, the median is the average of the n/2-th and (n/2 +1)-th terms.

But the median is a positive integer not in the list. So let's think about possible medians.

Wait, but the median is an integer, but the list can have non-integers? No, no, the list is of positive integers. So the median will either be an integer (if n is odd) or a half-integer (if n is even). But the problem says the median is a positive integer, so if n is even, the average of two integers must be integer, which implies the two middle numbers are the same. But if that's the case, then that number would be in the list, which would conflict with the median being a positive integer not in the list. So, wait, that's a problem.

Wait, let's think again. Let me consider n even and n odd cases.

Case 1: n is odd.

Then the median is the (n+1)/2-th term, which is an integer. Since the median is a positive integer not in the list, that means the (n+1)/2-th term is some integer not present in the list.

But wait, how can that be? Because if n is odd, the median is the middle element. So, for example, in a list of 5 numbers, the third one is the median. If that third number is not in the list, that can't be because the list is sorted, so the third element is definitely in the list. Wait, that's a contradiction. Hmm. So maybe n is even?

Wait, that's a problem. If n is odd, then the median is the middle number, which must be in the list. But the problem says the median is a positive integer not in the list. Therefore, n cannot be odd because that would require the median to be in the list, which contradicts the third condition.

Therefore, n must be even. Wait, but n even would mean that the median is the average of the two middle numbers, which can be an integer or not. But the problem says the median is a positive integer not in the list.

So if n is even, let's say n=2m. Then the median is (a_m + a_{m+1})/2, which must be an integer, because the median is given as a positive integer. Therefore, a_m + a_{m+1} must be even, so their average is an integer. And that integer is not present in the list.

So, for example, if a_m=7 and a_{m+1}=9, the median would be 8, which is not in the list. Or a_m=8 and a_{m+1}=8, then median is 8, which is in the list, which we don't want.

So, the two middle numbers must add up to an even number, and their average (the median) must not be in the list.

So, the two middle numbers must be such that their average is an integer not present in the list.

Okay, so for n even, the two middle numbers are two different integers, say x and y, such that (x+y)/2 is an integer not present in the list. So x and y must be such that x+y is even, so x and y must be both even or both odd.

Moreover, x and y cannot be equal because if they were, their average would be x, which would be present in the list, which we don't want.

So, in this case, the two middle numbers must be different and their average must not be in the list.

So, moving forward, n must be even because n odd would require the median to be in the list, which is not allowed.

So, n is even. Let's denote n=2m.

Now, let's consider the mode.

The mode is 9, which appears more times than any other number. So, the count of 9s is more than any other number's count.

Let's think of possible counts. Let's say 9 appears k times. All other numbers can appear at most k-1 times.

Now, the sum of all numbers is 30.

So, we need to construct a list of n even numbers, sum to 30, with mode 9, and median not in the list.

Another thing: the median is the average of the m-th and (m+1)-th terms. So, the two middle terms must be such that their average is an integer not in the list.

Let me try to outline possible steps:

1. Determine possible values of n (even numbers) such that the sum can be 30.

Wait, but n can be any even number, but given that the sum is 30, and all numbers are positive integers, the maximum possible n is 30 (all ones). But the mode is 9, so 9 has to appear multiple times. So, n can't be too large because 9s take up a lot of the sum.

Let me think about possible n.

Suppose mode 9 appears k times.

So, sum contributed by 9s is 9k.

The remaining sum is 30 -9k, which must be distributed among other numbers, each appearing at most k-1 times.

So, the minimal sum contributed by other numbers would be (n -k) *1, since the other numbers are at least 1.

So, 30 -9k >= (n -k)*1

Which rearranges to 30 -9k >= n -k

=> 30 -8k >=n

But n is even, so 30 -8k >=n.

Also, since 9k is part of the sum, 9k <=30, so k <=3 (since 9*3=27; 9*4=36>30).

So possible k values: 3, 2, 1. But mode must be unique and highest frequency.

If k=3, then other numbers can appear at most 2 times.

If k=2, then other numbers can appear at most once.

But wait, if k=1, then the mode is 9, but all other numbers can appear once. But then, since mode is unique, but all others can also appear once, that would make multiple modes, which isn't allowed. So k must be at least 2.

Wait, no, because the definition is unique mode, meaning only 9 has the highest frequency. So if 9 appears twice, other numbers can appear at most once. Then 9 is the unique mode.

If 9 appears three times, others can appear at most twice. But if another number appears twice, but 9 appears three times, then 9 is still the unique mode.

So, possible k is 2 or 3.

Let me try k=3 first.

Case 1: k=3, so 9 appears three times.

Sum from 9s: 9*3=27.

Remaining sum: 30-27=3.

This remaining 3 has to be distributed among (n-3) numbers, each at least 1.

So, 3 = (n-3)*1, since each must be at least 1. So n-3=3, so n=6.

Wait, n=6. So the list has 6 numbers, 3 of which are 9s, and the remaining 3 numbers sum to 3, each at least 1, and no number appears more than 2 times (since k=3 is the mode).

Wait, because if any other number appears twice, that's allowed because k=3 is still higher.

So, in this case, n=6.

Let me see if I can construct such a list.

So, sum is 30.

Numbers: 9,9,9, and three numbers summing to 3, each at least 1, and no number appears more than twice.

Possible options for the remaining three numbers:

We need three numbers, each at least 1, summing to 3.

Possible combinations:

1,1,1: sum to 3.

But they all appear once, which is okay.

Alternatively, 1,1,1 is acceptable.

Another option: 1,1,1 is the only way because any higher numbers would require others to be lower, but since each is at least 1.

So, the list would be [9,9,9,1,1,1].

Wait, but n=6, so the list is sorted: [1,1,1,9,9,9].

Now, the median would be the average of the 3rd and 4th terms.

So, the 3rd term is 1, the 4th term is 9.

Median is (1+9)/2=5.

Is 5 not present in the list? Yes.

So, the median is 5, which is not in the list.

That seems to satisfy all the conditions.

But wait, let's check the other conditions:

- Sum is 9*3 +1*3=27+3=30. Correct.

- Mode is 9, appears three times. Others appear once or three times. Wait, in this case, 1 appears three times as well. So, is 9 the unique mode?

Wait, no! Because 1 appears three times, same as 9. So, both 1 and 9 are modes, which would make it bimodal. But the problem says the unique mode is 9. So this list doesn't satisfy that condition.

Ah, so that's a problem. Because in this case, 9 and 1 both appear three times. So this violates the unique mode condition.

So, this case is invalid.

Therefore, k cannot be 3 with n=6.

Wait, but wait—n=6, and 9 appears three times, but so do the 1s. So, 1 and 9 both have frequency 3, so it's bimodal.

So, that's not allowed.

Therefore, this configuration doesn't work.

So, perhaps k=3 is not possible because it leads to another number having the same frequency.

Wait, unless the other numbers don't have the same frequency.

Wait, but in this case, the other numbers sum to 3, so if we have three 1s, they each appear once, but no, wait: the other numbers are three 1s, so each 1 appears once, but three 1s in total.

Wait, no, in the list [9,9,9,1,1,1], the number 1 appears three times, same as 9. So, that's a problem.

So, perhaps to prevent that, the other numbers can't have the same frequency as 9.

So, if 9 appears three times, other numbers must appear at most two times.

But in the case of n=6, the remaining three numbers have to sum to 3. So, if we have three 1s, each appearing once, but in total, three 1s. So, 1 appears three times, which is same as 9.

But in that case, 9 is not the unique mode.

So, perhaps we need the other numbers to appear fewer times.

Wait, perhaps instead of three 1s, we have two 1s and one 2.

So, 1,1,2: sum is 4, but we need to sum to 3. So that won't work.

Alternatively, 1,1,1: sum 3, but that leads to 1 appearing three times.

Wait, maybe a different approach: perhaps the remaining numbers can have higher values, but each appearing once.

Wait, but if n=6, and we have 3 9s, the remaining three numbers must sum to 3. The only way is 1,1,1. So that's the only possibility. So, in that case, it's impossible to have a unique mode. So, k=3 and n=6 leads to a bimodal list, which is invalid.

So, perhaps k=3 is not possible.

Wait, unless we have a different n.

Wait, let me think again. The initial assumption was that n=6 because 9*3=27, remaining sum 3, and n-3=3, so n=6.

But perhaps n is different.

Wait, the equation was 30 -9k >=n -k.

So, for k=3:

30 -9*3=3 >=n -3.

So, 3 >=n-3 => n<=6.

So, n=6 is the maximum possible for k=3.

So, with n=6, we have the problem of the other numbers potentially having the same frequency as 9.

Therefore, perhaps k=3 is not possible.

Alternatively, perhaps k=3 but the remaining numbers don't have the same frequency.

Wait, but in the case of n=6, 9 appears three times, and the remaining three numbers (each 1) also appear three times in total, but each 1 appears once. Wait, no, in the list, each 1 is a separate item, so the count for 1 is three, same as 9.

So, in this case, both 1 and 9 have a count of three. So, bimodal. So, that's not allowed.

Thus, perhaps k=3 is not a valid possibility. So, let's try k=2.

Case 2: k=2, so 9 appears twice.

Sum from 9s: 9*2=18.

Remaining sum: 30-18=12.

This remaining sum must be distributed among (n-2) numbers, each at least 1, and each appearing at most once (since mode is unique, 9 appears twice, others can appear at most once).

Wait, no—if k=2, the mode is 9, which appears twice. So, other numbers can appear at most once. Because if any other number appears twice, it would tie with 9 for mode, which is not allowed as 9 is unique.

So, the remaining numbers can each appear once.

Thus, the remaining sum is 12, and the number of remaining numbers is (n-2).

Since each is at least 1, the minimal sum is (n-2)*1 = n-2.

So, 12 >=n-2 => n<=14.

But n must be even, as we determined earlier.

So, possible n could be 4,6,8,10,12,14.

But let's think about the median.

Since n is even, the median is the average of the m-th and (m+1)-th terms, where m=n/2.

The median must be an integer not present in the list.

So, the two middle terms must add up to an even number, and their average (the median) must not be in the list.

So, let's consider possible n values.

Let me start with n=4.

n=4:

Total numbers: 4.

Two 9s, and two other numbers, each appearing once, summing to 12.

So, the two other numbers sum to 12.

Possible pairs: (1,11), (2,10), (3,9), (4,8), (5,7), (6,6).

But 9 is already in the list twice. So, if the other numbers are 3 and 9, that would mean 9 appears three times, which changes the mode, which we don't want.

So, can't have 3 and 9. Similarly, 6 and 6 would sum to 12, but 6 appears twice, which would tie with 9 only if k=3, but in this case, 9 appears twice. Wait, no, because 9 appears twice and 6 appears twice, so both would be modes, which is not allowed.

So, 6 and 6 can't be used.

Similarly, 4 and 8: both not in the list, so allowed.

So, the list could be [9,9,4,8].

Wait, but when sorted, it's [4,8,9,9].

So, the median is (8+9)/2=8.5, which is not an integer. But the problem states the median is a positive integer, so this is invalid.

Therefore, n=4 isn't possible because the median would not be an integer.

Alternatively, maybe the two numbers sum to 12 and are both such that their average is integer.

So, for the median to be integer, the two middle numbers must be both even or both odd.

So, in the case of n=4, the two middle numbers are the second and third in the sorted list.

Wait, let's try the pair (5,7): sum is 12, and average is 6.

So, the list would be [5,7,9,9].

Wait, when sorted: [5,7,9,9].

Median is (7+9)/2=8, which is an integer, and 8 is not in the list.

That works.

So, let's check the conditions:

- Sum: 5+7+9+9=30. Correct.

- Mode: 9 appears twice, others appear once. So, unique mode is 9. Correct.

- Median: 8, which is not in the list. Correct.

So, this is a valid list.

Wait, but wait, the two middle numbers are 7 and 9, which sum to 16, so median is 8.

So, that's valid.

So, in this case, n=4.

Wait, but let me check another possible pair: (2,10). Sum is 12. Sorted list: [2,9,9,10].

Median is (9+9)/2=9, which is in the list, so that's invalid.

Another pair: (1,11). Sorted list: [1,9,9,11]. Median is (9+9)/2=9, which is in the list. Invalid.

Another pair: (3,9). But 9 is already in the list, so in the list, 9 would appear three times, which we can't have because 9 is the mode, but in this case, it's already twice, and adding another 9 would make it three times, but the other numbers may not have that.

Wait, but if the two numbers are 3 and 9, then the list would be [3,9,9,9], but then 9 appears three times, which is still a unique mode, but in that case, n=4, but the two middle numbers are 9 and 9, so median is 9, which is in the list. So, invalid.

Another pair: (4,8). As before, median 8, which is not present.

So, the list [4,8,9,9] works.

Wait, is that correct?

Wait, the sorted list is [4,8,9,9]. The two middle numbers are 8 and 9. So, median is 8.5? Wait, no, wait, no, n=4, the two middle terms are the second and third, which are 8 and 9. So, median is (8+9)/2=8.5, which is not integer. So, invalid.

Wait, I think I made a mistake earlier.

Wait, no. Wait, in the list [5,7,9,9], the sorted order is [5,7,9,9]. The two middle terms are 7 and 9. Their sum is 16, so median is 8, which is an integer.

Yes, that's correct. So, in this case, n=4, the list is [5,7,9,9], sum is 30, mode is 9, median is 8, which is not in the list.

So, that's a valid list.

But wait, what about the pair (10, 2)? The list would be [2,9,9,10], sorted. The two middle terms are 9 and 9, so median is 9, which is in the list. So invalid.

Similarly, (6,6) leads to median 9.5, which is not integer.

So, only pair that works is (5,7), leading to median 8.

So, n=4 is possible.

Alternatively, let's check n=6.

n=6.

So, 9 appears twice, sum from 9s is 18.

Remaining sum is 12, to be distributed among 4 numbers, each appearing once, as mode is unique (others can appear at most once).

So, four numbers, each at least 1, summing to 12.

Possible combinations: For example, 1,2,3,6; 1,1,5,5 (but duplicates, which would cause mode issues, so not allowed).

Wait, each number must be unique or at most appearing once. Wait, no, because in the case of k=2, other numbers can appear at most once. So, in this case, the other four numbers must each appear once.

So, the four numbers must sum to 12, each appearing once.

Possible combinations:

1,2,3,6: sum is 12.

Another: 1,2,4,5: sum is 12.

Another: 1,3,4,4: but duplicates, not allowed.

So, let's take the first combination: 1,2,3,6.

So, the list is [1,2,3,6,9,9].

When sorted: [1,2,3,6,9,9].

The two middle terms are 3 and 6. So, their average is (3+6)/2=4.5, which is not an integer. So, invalid.

Another combination: 1,2,4,5.

List: [1,2,4,5,9,9].

Sorted: [1,2,4,5,9,9].

Median is (4+5)/2=4.5, again not integer.

Another combination: 2,3,4,3. Wait, no, duplicates. Not allowed.

Wait, another possible combination: 2,2,4,4. Sum is 12, but duplicates, so not allowed.

Alternatively, 1,1,5,5: duplicates, not allowed.

Hmm. Let me think of another way. Maybe including higher numbers.

Wait, another combination: 2,3,4,3: no, duplicates.

Wait, perhaps 3,4,2,3: same issue.

Alternatively, 1,3,4,4: duplicates.

Wait, maybe 2,2,2,6: sum is 12, but duplicates.

Alternatively, 1,1,1,9: sum is 12, but 9 is already in the list.

Wait, but 9 appears twice in the list.

So, perhaps the other four numbers must not include 9. So, 9 is already in the list twice, the other four numbers are different and not 9.

So, for four numbers, each at least 1, sum 12, all distinct, and none is 9.

So, let's see:

1,2,3,6: sum 12.

1,2,4,5: sum 12.

Are there others? 1,3,4,4: no, duplicates.

2,3,4,3: no.

Wait, perhaps 1,2,5,4: same as the second combination.

So, only two possible sets: 1,2,3,6 and 1,2,4,5.

Both give medians as 4.5, which is not an integer.

So, perhaps n=6 is not possible with k=2.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the two middle numbers are such that their average is integer, so their sum is even.

In the case of n=6, the two middle numbers are the 3rd and 4th terms.

So, if their sum is even, the median is integer.

So, in the list [1,2,3,6,9,9], the two middle numbers are 3 and 6, which sum to 9, which is odd, so median is 4.5.

But to have the median integer, their sum must be even. So, perhaps we can find four numbers that when sorted, the 3rd and 4th terms add up to even.

So, in the list, the four other numbers are a, b, c, d, sorted as a<=b<=c<=d.

We need (b + c) to be even.

So, either both b and c are even or both are odd.

So, in the case of the first combination: a=1, b=2, c=3, d=6.

b=2, c=3: sum is 5, odd. So, not good.

Second combination: a=1, b=2, c=4, d=5.

b=2, c=4: sum is 6, even. So, median is 3.

Wait, but in this case, the list is [1,2,4,5,9,9].

The two middle numbers are 4 and 5. Their sum is 9, which is odd. Wait, no. Wait, 4 and 5 sum to 9, which is odd. So, median is 4.5, which is not integer.

Wait, hold on. Wait, I think I made a mistake.

Wait, in the sorted list [1,2,4,5,9,9], the two middle numbers are the 3rd and 4th, which are 4 and 5. Their sum is 9, which is odd, so median is 4.5, not integer.

But in the combination where a=1, b=2, c=4, d=5, the two middle terms are 4 and 5, which sum to 9.

Wait, so that doesn't work.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps another combination: 2,3,4,3: but duplicates.

Alternatively, 3,3,4,2: duplicates.

Wait, perhaps 2,3,3,4: duplicates.

Wait, but no, because in the remaining four numbers, each can appear at most once.

So, perhaps I need to find four numbers that when added, their 3rd and 4th terms sum to even.

Wait, perhaps 1,3,5,3: duplicates, not allowed.

Alternatively, 1,3,5,3: same issue.

Wait, perhaps 2,4,4,2: duplicates.

Alternatively, 2,4,5,1: sorted as 1,2,4,5. Then, the two middle terms are 2 and 4. Sum is 6, which is even. So, median is 3, which is an integer not in the list.

Wait, let me check.

If the four numbers are 1,2,4,5. So, the list is [1,2,4,5,9,9].

Wait, but when sorted, it's [1,2,4,5,9,9]. The two middle terms are 4 and 5, sum is 9, which is odd, so median is 4.5, not integer. Wait, that's a contradiction.

Wait, no. Wait, n=6, so the two middle terms are the 3rd and 4th terms. In the sorted list [1,2,4,5,9,9], the 3rd term is 4, the 4th term is 5. So, their sum is 9, which is odd, so median is 4.5.

Wait, but earlier, when I thought the four numbers are 1,2,4,5, I thought that the middle terms would be 2 and 4, but no, because in the overall list, the 3rd and 4th terms are 4 and 5.

Wait, so perhaps I need a different approach. Maybe choose four numbers such that the 3rd and 4th terms in the entire list sum to even.

Wait, the entire list when sorted: [a, b, c, d, 9,9].

Wait, no, because the four numbers could be less than 9 or include numbers between.

Wait, perhaps the four numbers include some numbers greater than 9.

Wait, but 9 is already in the list twice, and the other four numbers must be different and not 9.

Wait, let me try another approach. Let's arrange the four numbers as follows: x, y, z, w, where x<=y<=z<=w.

We have x + y + z + w=12.

And, in the entire list of six numbers, when sorted, the 3rd and 4th terms are from the combined list.

Wait, the combined list would be [x, y, z, w,9,9], but only if x<=y<=z<=w<=9.

Alternatively, some of the four numbers could be greater than 9.

Wait, but 9 is already in the list twice, and the other numbers can be anything else.

Wait, for example, let's say the four numbers are 2,2,2,6. But duplicates, which would cause mode issues.

Wait, no, can't have duplicates because other numbers can appear at most once.

Wait, so perhaps all four numbers are unique and less than 9.

So, four unique numbers, sum 12, each at least 1.

Possible combinations:

1,2,3,6

1,2,4,5

These are the two possible combinations, as before.

In both cases, the two middle terms in the list of six numbers are 4 and 5 (from the second combination) or 3 and 6 (from the first combination), both leading to medians that are non-integers.

So, perhaps n=6 is not possible.

Wait, another idea: maybe the four numbers include a number greater than 9, which could shift the middle terms.

For example, let's say the four numbers are 1,2,3,6, but wait, that's four numbers. Wait, no, the four numbers are 1,2,3,6, sum 12.

So, the list is [1,2,3,6,9,9].

Sorted: [1,2,3,6,9,9].

The two middle terms are 3 and 6, which sum to 9, leading to median 4.5. Not integer.

Alternatively, four numbers are 1,2,4,5: sum 12.

List: [1,2,4,5,9,9].

Sorted: [1,2,4,5,9,9].

Two middle terms:4 and5, sum 9, median 4.5.

Not integer.

Another approach: perhaps the four numbers include a number higher than 9, so that when sorted, the two middle terms are both less than 9, and their sum is even.

Wait, let's say the four numbers are 1,1,1,9: but duplicates, not allowed.

Alternatively, 2,2,2,6: duplicates, not allowed.

Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe the four numbers are 3,3,3,3: duplicates, not allowed.

Wait, perhaps 5,5,1,1: duplicates.

No, because all four numbers must be unique or appear once.

Wait, perhaps the four numbers are 1,3,4,4: duplicates, not allowed.

So, perhaps n=6 is not possible.

Wait, let's try n=8.

n=8.

So, 9 appears twice, sum from 9s is 18.

Remaining sum: 30-18=12.

This sum must be distributed among 8-2=6 numbers, each appearing once, because mode is unique.

So, six numbers, each at least 1, summing to 12.

Possible combinations: 1,1,1,1,1,7: but duplicates, not allowed.

Wait, each number must be unique or appear once.

Wait, no, in this case, each number can appear once because mode is 9, which appears twice, so others can appear once.

But wait, in the remaining six numbers, if any number appears twice, it would tie with 9 for mode, which is not allowed.

So, each of the six numbers must appear once, and be unique.

So, we need six unique numbers, each at least 1, summing to 12.

The minimal sum for six unique numbers is 1+2+3+4+5+6=21, which is greater than 12.

So, this is impossible.

Therefore, n=8 is not possible.

Similarly, for n=10.

n=10.

Sum from 9s:18.

Remaining sum:12.

Number of remaining numbers:10-2=8.

Each must be at least 1 and unique.

Minimal sum is 1+2+3+4+5+6+7+8=36>12. Impossible.

Same for n=12,14: even larger minimal sums, so impossible.

Thus, the only possible n with k=2 is n=4.

So, the list is [5,7,9,9], which satisfies all conditions.

Wait, but earlier we considered n=4, and it worked.

But earlier, when I thought of n=6, I couldn't find a list that satisfies the conditions without causing the median to be a non-integer or the mode to be bimodal.

So, perhaps n=4 is the only possibility for k=2.

Wait, but wait, in the case of n=4, the list is [5,7,9,9], sum 30, mode 9, median 8, which is not in the list.

But wait, n=4: 5,7,9,9.

Sum:5+7+9+9=30.

Mode:9 appears twice, others once. So, unique mode.

Median: (7+9)/2=8, which is not in the list.

So, this is a valid list.

But earlier, I tried n=6, but couldn't find a suitable list that doesn't cause the median to be non-integer or the mode to be bimodal.

So, n=4 is the only possibility with k=2.

Wait, but let me check if k=2 with n=6 is possible with a different approach.

Wait, perhaps the four numbers are arranged such that the two middle terms sum to even.

Wait, for example, four numbers could be 2,2,4,4: sum is 12, duplicates, not allowed.

Alternatively, 3,3,3,3: duplicates.

Wait, no, perhaps 2,4,5,1: sum 12, but as before, the median is 4.5.

Wait, perhaps 4,4,2,2: duplicates.

Alternatively, 1,3,4,4: duplicates.

No, seems impossible.

Thus, perhaps the only possible list is [5,7,9,9], n=4.

But wait, let me think again.

Is there a way to arrange the four numbers such that the two middle terms sum to even?

Wait, for example, let the four numbers be 3,5,4,0: but 0 is not positive.

Wait, all numbers must be positive integers.

Alternatively, 2,4,5,1: sum 12.

Sorted list: [1,2,4,5,9,9].

Two middle terms:4 and5, sum 9, which is odd. So, median 4.5.

Not integer.

Hmm.

Wait, another combination: 3,3,3,3: duplicates, not allowed.

Alternatively, 1,1,5,5: duplicates.

No, not allowed.

Alternatively, 2,2,2,6: duplicates.

Not allowed.

So, I think n=6 is not possible.

Therefore, the only possible list is n=4: [5,7,9,9].

So, the sum of squares would be 5² +7² +9² +9²=25+49+81+81= let's compute.

25+49=74.

74+81=155.

155+81=236.

So, sum of squares is 236.

But wait, let me check if there's another possible list with k=2 and n=6.

Wait, perhaps if the four numbers are arranged such that two middle terms are both even or both odd, leading to an integer median.

Wait, let's try four numbers as 2,2,2,6: duplicates, not allowed.

Alternatively, 3,3,3,3: duplicates.

No.

Wait, perhaps four numbers are 1,3,5,3: duplicates.

No.

Alternatively, 4,4,2,2: duplicates.

No.

Wait, perhaps 6,6,0,0: but 0 is not positive.

No.

Hmm.

Alternatively, four numbers: 1,1,5,5: duplicates.

No.

Wait, perhaps 2,4,6,0: 0 invalid.

No.

Alternatively, 3,5,1,3: duplicates.

No.

Wait, perhaps 4,5,1,2: sum 12.

So, four numbers are 1,2,4,5: sum 12.

List: [1,2,4,5,9,9].

Sorted: [1,2,4,5,9,9].

Median is (4+5)/2=4.5: not integer.

So, invalid.

So, perhaps no way to get n=6.

Thus, the only possible list is n=4: [5,7,9,9].

So, sum of squares is 25 +49 +81 +81=236.

But wait, let me think again. Is there another possible list with k=2 and n=4?

Wait, the pair (5,7) is one possibility.

Another pair could be (something else that sums to 12, leading to two middle numbers that add to even).

Wait, let's think of two numbers x and y, where x + y=12, and x <= y.

We need x and y such that when arranged, the two middle terms add to even.

Wait, in the case of n=4, the two middle terms are the second and third numbers.

Wait, no, for n=4, the two middle terms are the 2nd and 3rd terms.

Wait, no, for n=4, the two middle terms are the 2nd and 3rd when sorted.

Wait, let me clarify.

Wait, for n=4, sorted list is [a, b, c, d].

Median is (b + c)/2.

We need (b + c) to be even, so median is integer.

And the median should not be in the list.

So, let's think of two numbers x and y, summing to 12, such that when combined with two 9s, the two middle terms sum to even.

So, let's say the four numbers are x, y,9,9.

When sorted, it can be arranged as [x, y,9,9] if x<=y<=9.

Or, if x or y are greater than 9, but that would complicate the order.

But since the two 9s are the largest numbers, unless x or y are larger than 9, which would require sum x+y=12, so each can be at most 11, but that's not necessary.

Wait, but let's think of x and y such that when sorted, the two middle terms are y and9.

Wait, no, let's say x <= y <=9.

So, sorted list: [x, y,9,9].

Median is (y +9)/2.

We need this to be integer, so y +9 must be even.

So, y must be odd, because 9 is odd.

So, y is odd, and x + y=12.

So, x=12 - y.

So, y can be 1,3,5,7,9,11.

But y <=9, so y can be 1,3,5,7,9.

But x must be <= y.

So, let's check possible y:

y=9: x=3.

So, numbers are 3 and9. But 9 is already in the list twice.

Wait, but x=3, y=9: so the four numbers are 3,9,9,9.

Wait, but that would make 9 appear three times, which is more than the two times.

So, invalid.

y=7: x=5.

So, numbers are 5 and7.

So, the list is [5,7,9,9].

Which is the same as before.

y=5: x=7.

But then x=7>y=5, which would swap x and y.

So, same as above.

y=3: x=9.

But x=9>y=3, so sorted list would be [3,9,9,9], which again makes 9 appear three times. Invalid.

y=1: x=11.

But x=11>y=1, sorted list: [1,9,9,11].

Wait, but then the two middle terms are 9 and9.

Median is (9+9)/2=9, which is in the list. Invalid.

So, the only possible y is 7, leading to x=5.

Thus, the only valid list is [5,7,9,9].

So, sum of squares is 25 +49 +81 +81=236.

But wait, let me verify once more.

Another possibility: can we have the two middle terms be both even or both odd, and their sum even, without the median being in the list.

Wait, if y=7, then the two middle terms are7 and9.

7 is odd,9 is odd: sum is16, which is even. So, median is8.

Which is not in the list.

Yes.

So, that's correct.

Thus, the only possible list is [5,7,9,9], sum of squares=236.

Wait, but let me think if there's another possible list with k=2 and n=4.

Wait, another pair x and y: for example, x=4 and y=8.

Sum is12.

So, the list is [4,8,9,9].

When sorted: [4,8,9,9].

Median is (8+9)/2=8.5, not integer. So, invalid.

So, that's not acceptable.

Another pair: x=6 and y=6.

But duplicates, which would make 6 appear twice, same as 9. So, bimodal, invalid.

Another pair: x=2 and y=10.

Sum is12.

List: [2,10,9,9].

Sorted: [2,9,9,10].

Median is (9+9)/2=9, which is in the list. Invalid.

Another pair: x=1 and y=11.

List: [1,11,9,9].

Sorted: [1,9,9,11].

Median is (9+9)/2=9, which is in the list. Invalid.

Thus, only the pair (5,7) works.

Therefore, the only valid list is [5,7,9,9], with sum of squares 25+49+81+81=236.

Wait, but wait a minute. Earlier, I considered n=4 with k=2, but what if k=2 and n=6 is possible with a different arrangement.

Wait, perhaps the four numbers are arranged such that the two middle terms are 8 and something else, but that seems impossible.

Alternatively, perhaps I missed a combination.

Wait, let me think of four numbers that when combined with two 9s, the two middle terms are both even or both odd.

Wait, for example, four numbers could be 2,4,6,0: but 0 is invalid.

Alternatively, 3,5,7,7: duplicates.

No.

Alternatively, 2,4,6,0: same issue.

Wait, perhaps 4,4,4,0: duplicates and 0 invalid.

No.

Hmm.

I think I've exhausted the possibilities, and the only valid list is [5,7,9,9], sum of squares 236.

Therefore, the answer is 236.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To solve the problem, we analyze the given conditions:

1. The sum of the list is 30.
2. The unique mode is 9.
3. The median is a positive integer not present in the list.

Let's break down the reasoning:

### Step 1: Determine the number of elements (n)
- The median must be an integer not in the list. This implies the list length \( n \) must be even because the median of an even-length list is the average of two middle numbers, which can be an integer if their sum is even.
- Let \( n = 2m \). The median is the average of the \( m \)-th and \( (m+1) \)-th terms.

### Step 2: Analyze the mode
- The mode is 9, appearing more frequently than any other number.
- Let 9 appear \( k \) times. Other numbers can appear at most \( k-1 \) times.

### Step 3: Consider possible values of \( k \)
- If \( k = 3 \), the sum of 9s is \( 27 \), leaving \( 3 \) to be distributed among \( n-3 \) numbers. However, this leads to another number also appearing three times, making the mode bimodal, which is invalid.
- If \( k = 2 \), the sum of 9s is \( 18 \), leaving \( 12 \) to be distributed among \( n-2 \) numbers, each appearing once.

### Step 4: Determine \( n \) for \( k = 2 \)
- For \( n = 4 \), the remaining two numbers must sum to \( 12 \). The valid pair is \( 5 \) and \( 7 \), giving the list \( [5, 7, 9, 9] \).
- Check the median: The sorted list is \( [5, 7, 9, 9] \). The median is \( \frac{7 + 9}{2} = 8 \), which is not in the list, satisfying all conditions.

### Step 5: Verify other possible \( n \) values
- For \( n = 6 \), the remaining four numbers must sum to \( 12 \) and appear once. However, all valid combinations result in a non-integer median or mode issues.
- Larger \( n \) values exceed the remaining sum or require duplicate numbers, which is invalid.

### Conclusion
The only valid list is \( [5, 7, 9, 9] \). The sum of the squares is:
\[
5^2 + 7^2 + 9^2 + 9^2 = 25 + 49 + 81 + 81 = 236
\]

**Answer:** \boxed{236}
