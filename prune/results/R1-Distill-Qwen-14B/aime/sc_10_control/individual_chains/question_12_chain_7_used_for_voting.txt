Okay, so I have this problem where I need to figure out how many ways I can fill a 2x3 grid with digits (0-9) such that two conditions are met. First, when reading the grid left to right, the two 3-digit numbers add up to 999. Second, when reading the grid top to bottom, the three 2-digit numbers add up to 99. 

Let me try to visualize the grid. It's a 2-row by 3-column grid. Let me denote the cells as follows:

a b c
d e f

So, the top row is a, b, c and the bottom row is d, e, f. 

When reading left to right, the top row forms a 3-digit number, which is abc, and the bottom row is def. So, the sum of abc and def should be 999. That means abc + def = 999.

When reading top to bottom, each column forms a 2-digit number. So, the first column is ad, the second is be, and the third is cf. Their sum should be 99. So, ad + be + cf = 99.

So, the problem is to find all possible digits a, b, c, d, e, f (each from 0 to 9) such that:

1. 100a + 10b + c + 100d + 10e + f = 999
2. 10a + d + 10b + e + 10c + f = 99

Let me write these equations more clearly.

Equation 1: 100a + 10b + c + 100d + 10e + f = 999
Equation 2: 10a + d + 10b + e + 10c + f = 99

I can try to subtract equation 2 from equation 1 to see if that simplifies things, but wait, equation 1 is the sum of two 3-digit numbers and equation 2 is the sum of three 2-digit numbers. Let me think about another approach.

Alternatively, maybe I can express equation 1 as:

(100a + 10b + c) + (100d + 10e + f) = 999

Which tells me that the sum of the top number (abc) and the bottom number (def) is 999. So, each is a 3-digit number, and their sum is 999. So, abc = 999 - def.

Similarly, equation 2 is:

(10a + d) + (10b + e) + (10c + f) = 99

Which can be written as ad + be + cf = 99.

Hmm. So, maybe I can think about the digits of abc and def in terms of their sum. Since abc + def = 999, which is a number with all 9's, I think that might imply that when adding abc and def, each digit column adds up to 9, right?

Wait, for example, if we have abc
+ def
=999

Then, adding the units place: c + f = 9 or 19, but since each digit is 0-9, c + f can only be 9 or 19. But since 19 would require a carryover of 1, but in the tens place, we have b + e plus any carryover from the units place equals 9 or 19, and similarly for the hundreds place.

Wait, but 999 is 9 in each digit place. So, in units place: c + f = 9 or 19. But since both c and f are single digits, their maximum sum is 9+9=18. So, 19 is impossible. So, c + f must be 9, and there is no carryover to the tens place.

Similarly, in the tens place: b + e must equal 9, because there's no carryover from the units place. And in the hundreds place: a + d must equal 9, because again, no carryover from the tens place.

Wait, so that gives me:

c + f = 9

b + e = 9

a + d = 9

That's from the addition abc + def = 999.

Now, looking at equation 2: ad + be + cf = 99.

Let me denote ad as 10a + d, be as 10b + e, and cf as 10c + f.

So, equation 2 is:

(10a + d) + (10b + e) + (10c + f) = 99

Hmm, okay. Let me rewrite that:

10a + d + 10b + e + 10c + f = 99

I can rearrange the terms:

10a + 10b + 10c + d + e + f = 99

Factor 10 from the first three terms:

10(a + b + c) + (d + e + f) = 99

So, 10*(a + b + c) + (d + e + f) = 99.

But wait, from equation 1, abc + def = 999, which is 100a + 10b + c + 100d + 10e + f = 999.

So, that's 100a + 10b + c + 100d + 10e + f = 999.

Which can be written as (100a + 10b + c) + (100d + 10e + f) = 999.

So, from the first part, I have a + d = 9, b + e = 9, c + f = 9.

So, each pair (a,d), (b,e), (c,f) adds to 9.

So, from equation 2's rewritten form:

10(a + b + c) + (d + e + f) = 99.

But since a + d =9, d=9 -a.

Similarly, e=9 -b, f=9 -c.

So, let me substitute d, e, f in terms of a, b, c.

So, d =9 -a, e=9 -b, f=9 -c.

Therefore, d + e + f = (9 -a) + (9 -b) + (9 -c) = 27 - (a + b + c).

So, equation 2 becomes:

10(a + b + c) + (27 - (a + b + c)) =99.

Simplify:

10S + 27 - S =99, where S = a + b + c.

So, 9S +27 =99.

Subtract 27 from both sides: 9S =72.

Divide by 9: S=8.

So, a + b + c =8.

So, now I know that a + b + c =8, and each of a, b, c is a digit (0-9), and each pair a+d=9, etc.

So, let me summarize:

From the sum abc + def =999:

a + d=9

b + e=9

c + f=9

From the sum ad + be + cf=99:

We get a + b + c =8.

So, our variables are a, b, c, d, e, f, with:

a + d=9

b + e=9

c + f=9

a + b + c=8

So, d =9 - a

e=9 - b

f=9 - c

Our constraints are:

- a is a digit (0-9), same for b, c.

- Since a is the first digit of a 3-digit number abc, a cannot be 0. Otherwise, abc would be a 2-digit number. So, a must be at least 1.

Same for d: since def is a 3-digit number, d cannot be 0. So, d=9 -a must be at least 1.

So, 9 -a >=1 => a <=8.

So, a can be from 1 to 8.

Similarly, for b: looking at the 2-digit number ad, which is 10a + d. Since d is 9 -a, which is at least 1 when a is 8 (d=1). So, ad is a two-digit number, which is fine as long as a is >=1 and d is >=1, which we've already ensured.

Similarly, for the other 2-digit numbers be and cf, their tens digits are b and c, respectively, which can be 0, since be is 10b + e, and e=9 -b. So, if b=0, e=9, so be=09, which is a valid two-digit number. Similarly, c can be 0.

So, the main constraints are:

a: 1-8

b: 0-9

c: 0-9

With a + b + c=8.

So, the problem reduces to finding the number of non-negative integer solutions to a + b + c=8, where a is at least 1 and at most8, and b and c are at least 0 and at most9.

But wait, since a can be from 1 to 8, and b and c from 0 to 9, but with a + b + c=8.

I need to count the number of ordered triples (a,b,c) where a is in [1,8], b and c are in [0,9], and a + b + c=8.

Each of these triples defines d, e, f as d=9-a, e=9-b, f=9 -c.

Moreover, we must ensure that d, e, f are digits, i.e., d, e, f are between 0 and9. But since d=9 -a, and a is at least1, d is at most8 and at least1. Similarly, e=9 -b, and since b can be up to8 (because a + b + c=8, and a is at least1, so b can be 0 to7), but wait, no: a is at least1, so b can be up to 8 -1=7? Wait, no, not necessarily. Let me think.

Wait, a can be from1 to8, and a + b + c=8. So, for each a, b can be from 0 to min(8 -a,9), and c=8 -a -b. But since c must be >=0, so b can be from 0 to8 -a, and since 8 -a can be up to7 (when a=1), down to 0 (when a=8). So, b can be up to7, but wait, 8 -a can be up to7, which is less than9, so b is actually bounded by 8 -a, which is <=7. So, in all cases, b will be <=7, so e=9 -b >=2.

Similarly, c=8 -a -b. Since a + b <=8, so c=8 -a -b >=0. Also, c can be up to8 -a, which could be up to7 (when a=1, b=0, c=7). So, f=9 -c >=2.

Wait, so all d, e, f will be >=2, except for when a=8, d=1, and when b=0, e=9, and when c=0, f=9. But wait, c can be zero, but then f=9, which is allowed, as f is a digit.

Wait, but actually, when a=8, d=1, which is fine. When b=0, e=9, which is allowed. When c=0, f=9, which is allowed.

So, all digits d, e, f will be between1 and9, which is acceptable as digits (0 is allowed but in this case, since a=8, d=1; for b=0, e=9; c=0, f=9). So, all digits are valid.

So, the problem reduces to finding the number of ordered triples (a,b,c) where a is from1 to8, b and c are from0 to9, and a + b + c=8.

So, how many solutions are there to a + b + c=8, with a ≥1, a ≤8; b ≥0, b ≤9; c ≥0, c ≤9.

This is a stars and bars problem with constraints.

The number of non-negative integer solutions to a + b + c =8 with a >=1 can be found by substituting a' =a -1, so a' >=0. Then, a' + b + c=7, with a' <=7 (since a <=8, a' <=7), and b <=9, c <=9.

So, the number of non-negative solutions without constraints is C(7 +3 -1,3 -1) = C(9,2)=36.

But we need to subtract the solutions where a' >7 or b >9 or c >9.

Wait, a' is a' =a -1, and a' <=7 because a <=8. So, a' can be 0 to7. So, the upper limit for a' is7, but since we're counting a' + b + c =7, the maximum a' can be is7, so a' can't exceed that. So, no solutions where a' >7, since a' + b + c=7 and a' >=0, so a' can't be more than7.

Similarly, for b and c, they can go up to9, but in our case, since a' + b + c=7, each of b and c can be at most7, because if b=8, then a' + c= -1, which is impossible. So, in this case, b and c cannot exceed7 because a' + b + c=7. So, the constraints b <=9 and c <=9 are automatically satisfied because b and c can be at most7.

Wait, that's not correct. Wait, in the equation a' + b + c=7, each variable is non-negative, so the maximum value of b is7 (if a'=0 and c=0). Similarly for c. So, b and c can't exceed7 here, so the constraints b <=9 and c <=9 are automatically satisfied because 7 <=9. So, the only constraint we have is a' <=7, which is already handled.

Therefore, the number of solutions is C(7 +3 -1, 3-1) = C(9,2)=36.

Wait, but wait, this counts the number of non-negative integer solutions to a' + b + c=7, which is 36. Each of these corresponds to a solution where a = a' +1, b, c.

So, the total number of ordered triples (a, b, c) is36.

But wait, I should double-check this because sometimes when variables have upper limits, you might have to subtract cases where variables exceed their limits, but in this case, since the sum is7, and each variable is non-negative, the maximum any variable can be is7, which is less than9, so no need to subtract anything.

So, 36 solutions.

But wait, let me confirm. Let's think: the original equation is a + b + c=8, with a >=1, so a' =a -1, so a' + b + c=7.

We have to find the number of non-negative integer solutions, which is C(7 +3 -1,3-1)=C(9,2)=36.

Yes, that's correct.

But wait, each a, b, c corresponds to a unique grid, right? Because once a, b, c are chosen, d, e, f are uniquely determined as d=9 -a, e=9 -b, f=9 -c.

So, each solution (a,b,c) gives a unique grid. So, the number of grids is equal to the number of solutions, which is36.

Wait, but wait, no. Because a, b, c are digits. a is from1-8, b and c from0-9, but in our substitution, a' can be0-7, and b and c can be0-7 as well. But wait, in reality, b and c can be up to9. However, in this particular case, since a' + b + c=7, the maximum b or c can be is7. So, even if the problem allows b or c to be up to9, in this particular equation, they can't exceed7. So, all solutions are valid.

Thus, the total number of grids is36.

Wait, but hold on a second. Let me think about the initial example given in the problem.

The example is:

0 0 8

9 9 1

So, the top row is0 0 8, which is 008, but that's just 8, a single-digit number. Similarly, the bottom row is9 9 1, which is991.

So, abc + def =8 +991=999. So, the top number could be a single-digit or two-digit or three-digit, depending on the leading zeros. But in our earlier reasoning, we assumed that a is at least1 because it's the first digit of a 3-digit number. But in this example, a=0, which would make abc=008, which is 8, a single-digit number. So, perhaps our initial assumption that a must be at least1 is incorrect.

Wait, this complicates things. So, the problem says "the sum of the two numbers formed by reading left to right is 999". So, if the top row is 008, that's 8, and the bottom row is991, which is991, their sum is999. So, in this case, a=0 is allowed, but that would make the top number a single-digit, but the problem says "the two numbers formed by reading left to right", so each row is a number. So, the top row is a 3-digit number, possibly with leading zeros, like 008, which is effectively 8, but in terms of the problem, it's considered as a 3-digit number 008.

Similarly, the bottom row is a 3-digit number 991.

So, in that case, a can be zero, as the top row can be 00x, which is a 3-digit number with leading zeros. Similarly, the bottom row can have d=0, but wait, in the example, d=9, so it's fine.

Wait, but if a=0, then d=9, because a + d=9.

So, in this case, a can be 0, which allows the top row to be a 3-digit number starting with zero, which is acceptable.

But in our earlier analysis, we considered a >=1, but in reality, a can be 0. So, that changes things.

Wait, so the initial mistake was assuming a >=1, but in reality, a can be0, because the top row is allowed to have leading zeros. Similarly, d=9 -a, so if a=0, d=9, which is allowed since the bottom row is a 3-digit number, so d can be zero, but in this case, d=9, which is fine.

So, let's correct that. So, a can be0-9, but wait, no. Wait, a is a digit, so a can be 0-9, but with the constraint a + d=9, so d=9 -a. Since d is a digit (0-9), a can be0-9. But if a=9, then d=0, which is allowed because the bottom row can be a 3-digit number starting with0, like 0xy, which is a 3-digit number. Wait, no, 0xy is effectively a two-digit number, but in the problem statement, it's considered a 3-digit number?

Wait, the problem says "the sum of the two numbers formed by reading left to right is 999". So, if the grid is:

0 0 8

0 0 8

Then, the top number is008=8, and the bottom number is008=8, their sum is16, which is not 999. But in this case, a=0 is allowed, but the sum is not 999. So, in the problem, the sum has to be exactly999, so the two numbers must add up to999. So, if a=0, then d=9, so def is a 3-digit number starting with9, which is fine.

Wait, but in the example given, the top number is008, which is allowed because the sum is8 +991=999.

So, perhaps, a can be0, as the problem allows leading zeros in the numbers formed by the rows.

So, going back, the initial equations were:

a + d=9

b + e=9

c + f=9

And a + b + c=8.

But now, a can be0, because the top row can be a 3-digit number starting with zero. So, let's redo the analysis.

So, a can be0-9, but with a + d=9, so d=9 -a, which must be a digit (0-9). So, a can be0-9, but d=9 -a must also be0-9, which is always true because a is0-9.

Similarly for b and c.

So, our main constraint is a + b + c=8, with a, b, c in0-9.

So, how many non-negative integer solutions are there to a + b + c=8, where a, b, c are digits (0-9).

This is a standard stars and bars problem, except that each variable is <=9, but since8 is less than9, the constraints are automatically satisfied, so every solution is valid.

The number of non-negative integer solutions is C(8 +3 -1,3 -1)=C(10,2)=45.

So, the number of solutions is45.

But wait, that would be the case if a, b, c are allowed to be0-9. But in our problem, a, b, c are digits, so 0-9, which is allowed, so indeed, all solutions are valid.

Wait, but earlier, when I thought a couldn't be0, I got36 solutions, but that was incorrect because the problem allows a=0.

So, the correct number is45.

But wait, let me check with the example.

In the example, a=0, b=0, c=8. So, a + b + c=0+0+8=8. So, this is one of the solutions. So, that's correct.

So, now, the number of solutions is45.

But wait, each solution (a, b, c) gives a unique grid, because d=9 -a, e=9 -b, f=9 -c.

But wait, we have to ensure that d, e, f are digits (0-9), which they are because a, b, c are digits, so 9 -a, 9 -b, 9 -c are also digits.

So, for each solution (a, b, c), we get a valid grid.

Hence, the total number of grids is45.

Wait, but wait a second. Let me check another example to see if all these solutions are valid.

Suppose a=8, b=0, c=0. Then d=1, e=9, f=9. So, the grid is:

8 0 0

1 9 9

So, the top number is800, the bottom number is199. Their sum is800 +199=999, which is correct.

The column sums: ad=81, be=09=9, cf=09=9. So, 81 +9 +9=99, which is correct.

Another example: a=0, b=0, c=8. Then d=9, e=9, f=1. So, as in the problem statement.

Another example: a=1, b=2, c=5. Then d=8, e=7, f=4. So, the grid is:

1 2 5

8 7 4

Sum of rows:125 +874=999. Sum of columns:18 +27 +54=18+27=45, 45+54=99. Correct.

So, seems valid.

So, the number of solutions is45.

But wait, earlier I thought it was36, but that was when a >=1. Since a can be0, the number is45.

Wait, but let me think again.

The problem is that in the equation a + b + c=8, a can be0, so the number of non-negative solutions is C(8 +3 -1, 3-1)=C(10,2)=45.

Yes, that's correct.

So, the answer should be45.

But wait, I'm a bit confused because the problem states that the example grid is:

0 0 8

9 9 1

Which gives a=0, b=0, c=8, so d=9, e=9, f=1. So, a=0 is allowed.

So, the initial mistake was thinking a >=1, which was incorrect.

Therefore, the correct number of solutions is45.

Wait, but wait another moment. Are there any constraints I'm missing? For example, in the grid, the top row is abc, which is a 3-digit number, but when a=0, it's a number like00x, which is fine because leading zeros are allowed in the problem.

Similarly, d=9 -a can be9 when a=0, which gives def as9ef, a 3-digit number.

So, all digits are allowed, including leading zeros.

So, the number of possible grids is45.

Wait, but wait, another angle: each of the digits a, b, c can be0-9, but in this case, a + b + c=8, so the maximum any of them can be is8, so all digits are allowed without issues because8 is less than9.

So, no need to worry about any digit exceeding9.

So, the total number is45.

Wait, but in the initial problem statement, the example grid uses a=0, which is allowed, so the total number of grids is45.

So, I think that's the answer.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To solve the problem, we need to determine the number of ways to fill a 2x3 grid with digits (0-9) such that:

1. The sum of the two 3-digit numbers formed by reading left to right is 999.
2. The sum of the three 2-digit numbers formed by reading top to bottom is 99.

Let the grid be represented as:

```
a b c
d e f
```

### Key Steps:

1. **Sum of Rows (abc + def = 999):**
   - Since 999 has all digits as 9, each column of digits in abc and def must add up to 9.
   - Therefore:
     - \( a + d = 9 \)
     - \( b + e = 9 \)
     - \( c + f = 9 \)

2. **Sum of Columns (ad + be + cf = 99):**
   - Expressing each column as a 2-digit number:
     - \( ad = 10a + d \)
     - \( be = 10b + e \)
     - \( cf = 10c + f \)
   - Summing these gives:
     \[
     10a + d + 10b + e + 10c + f = 99
     \]
   - Simplifying:
     \[
     10(a + b + c) + (d + e + f) = 99
     \]
   - Using \( d = 9 - a \), \( e = 9 - b \), \( f = 9 - c \), we substitute:
     \[
     10(a + b + c) + (27 - (a + b + c)) = 99
     \]
   - Simplifying further:
     \[
     9(a + b + c) + 27 = 99 \implies a + b + c = 8
     \]

3. **Counting Solutions:**
   - We need to find the number of non-negative integer solutions to \( a + b + c = 8 \), where \( a, b, c \) are digits (0-9).
   - Using stars and bars, the number of solutions is \( \binom{8 + 3 - 1}{3 - 1} = \binom{10}{2} = 45 \).

Each solution corresponds to a unique grid configuration, as \( d, e, f \) are determined by \( d = 9 - a \), \( e = 9 - b \), \( f = 9 - c \).

### Final Answer:
The number of valid grids is \(\boxed{45}\).
