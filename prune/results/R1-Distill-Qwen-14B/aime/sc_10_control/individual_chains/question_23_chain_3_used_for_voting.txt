Okay, so I've got this problem here about a hyperbola and a rhombus. Let me try to break it down step by step. The hyperbola is given by the equation x²/20 - y²/24 = 1. So, this is a standard hyperbola centered at the origin, opening to the left and right along the x-axis. The transverse axis length is sqrt(20), which is 2*sqrt(5), and the conjugate axis is sqrt(24), which is 2*sqrt(6). 

The problem mentions points A, B, C, and D on this hyperbola forming a rhombus ABCD. The diagonals of the rhombus intersect at the origin. So, the rhombus is centered at the origin, and its diagonals are along the coordinate axes? Or maybe not necessarily along the axes, but they intersect at the origin.

Wait, for a rhombus, the diagonals bisect each other at right angles, right? Or is that for a square? No, wait, in a rhombus, the diagonals bisect each other but aren't necessarily perpendicular unless it's a square. Hmm, actually, I think in a rhombus, the diagonals are not necessarily perpendicular, but in a square, which is a special case of a rhombus, they are. Wait, no, actually, now I'm getting confused.

Let me recall: In a rhombus, the diagonals bisect each other and bisect the angles, but they are not necessarily perpendicular unless it's a square. Wait, no, actually, in a rhombus, the diagonals are not perpendicular unless it's a square. No, wait, that's not right. I think in a rhombus, the diagonals are not perpendicular, but in a square, which is a rhombus, they are. Wait, no, I think that's incorrect. Let me check.

Wait, no, in a rhombus, the diagonals are not necessarily perpendicular. Wait, no, I'm wrong. Actually, in a rhombus, the diagonals are not perpendicular. Wait, no, that's not right. Hold on, I think I'm getting confused between rectangles and rhombuses. In a rectangle, the diagonals are equal in length and bisect each other but aren't perpendicular unless it's a square. In a rhombus, the diagonals are perpendicular but aren't necessarily equal. Wait, yes, that's right! In a rhombus, the diagonals are perpendicular bisectors of each other. So, they intersect at right angles, even though they aren't necessarily equal in length. So, in this case, the rhombus has its diagonals intersecting at the origin, which is the center of the hyperbola.

So, since the diagonals intersect at the origin, the points A, B, C, D must be arranged such that the diagonals are AC and BD, intersecting at the origin. So, the origin is the midpoint of both diagonals.

So, if the diagonals are AC and BD, then points A and C are endpoints of one diagonal, and points B and D are endpoints of the other. Since the origin is their midpoint, if A is (x, y), then C must be (-x, -y). Similarly, if B is (u, v), then D must be (-u, -v).

Now, since all four points lie on the hyperbola x²/20 - y²/24 = 1, then plugging in, each point satisfies this equation.

So, let me write down the coordinates:

A: (x, y)
C: (-x, -y)
B: (u, v)
D: (-u, -v)

All four points satisfy x²/20 - y²/24 = 1, so:

For A: x²/20 - y²/24 = 1
For B: u²/20 - v²/24 = 1

So, both (x, y) and (u, v) lie on the hyperbola.

Now, since ABCD is a rhombus, all sides are equal in length. So, the lengths AB, BC, CD, DA are all equal.

But perhaps it's easier to approach this using vectors or coordinates. Let me think about the vectors.

Since the diagonals intersect at the origin, the coordinates of the points are such that vectors OA and OC are negatives of each other, and similarly for OB and OD.

In a rhombus, the diagonals are perpendicular. So, vectors OA and OB should be perpendicular? Wait, no. Wait, the diagonals are AC and BD, so the vectors AC and BD should be perpendicular.

So, vector AC is from A to C, which is (-2x, -2y), and vector BD is from B to D, which is (-2u, -2v). The dot product of AC and BD should be zero because the diagonals are perpendicular.

So, AC · BD = 0.
(-2x)(-2u) + (-2y)(-2v) = 0
4xu + 4yv = 0
Divide both sides by 4:
xu + yv = 0

So, we have the condition that xu + yv = 0.

Now, we need to find BD². BD is the length of the diagonal from B to D, which is the distance between points B and D. Since D is (-u, -v), the distance BD is sqrt[(u - (-u))² + (v - (-v))²] = sqrt[(2u)² + (2v)²] = 2*sqrt(u² + v²). Therefore, BD² = (2*sqrt(u² + v²))² = 4(u² + v²).

So, BD² = 4(u² + v²). We need to find the greatest real number that is less than BD² for all such rhombi. So, essentially, we need to find the infimum of BD², i.e., the minimum possible value of BD², because the greatest number less than BD² for all rhombi would be the infimum. Wait, no. Wait, the problem says "the greatest real number that is less than BD² for all such rhombi". So, perhaps it's the infimum, as the greatest lower bound.

Wait, but let me think again. Let me consider that the question is asking for the supremum of the lower bounds for BD². So, the greatest number that is less than or equal to all BD². Hmm, that would be the infimum of BD² over all possible rhombi. Because if we can find the minimum possible BD², then any number less than that would be less than all BD², but the greatest such number would be the minimum BD² itself. But wait, the problem says "the greatest real number that is less than BD² for all such rhombi". So, it's the supremum of the lower bounds, which is the infimum. So, perhaps the minimal BD².

So, we need to minimize BD² = 4(u² + v²) subject to the conditions:

1. u²/20 - v²/24 = 1 (since B lies on the hyperbola)
2. xu + yv = 0 (from the perpendicularity of diagonals)
3. x²/20 - y²/24 = 1 (since A lies on the hyperbola)

Wait, but we don't know x and y yet. So, perhaps we need another condition. Alternatively, maybe we can express x and y in terms of u and v or vice versa.

Wait, since A is (x, y), and C is (-x, -y), and B is (u, v), and D is (-u, -v). So, we have points A, B, C, D on the hyperbola, forming a rhombus with diagonals intersecting at the origin.

In a rhombus, the sides are equal, so AB = BC = CD = DA.

Let me compute the distance AB. Point A is (x, y), point B is (u, v). So, AB² = (x - u)² + (y - v)².

Similarly, BC² = (u - (-x))² + (v - (-y))² = (u + x)² + (v + y)².

Since it's a rhombus, AB² = BC². So,

(x - u)² + (y - v)² = (x + u)² + (y + v)².

Expanding both sides:

Left: x² - 2xu + u² + y² - 2yv + v²
Right: x² + 2xu + u² + y² + 2yv + v²

Subtracting right from left:

(-2xu - 2yv) - (2xu + 2yv) = 0
-4xu -4yv = 0
Divide both sides by -4:
xu + yv = 0.

Wait, but this is the same condition as before! So, that doesn't give us any new information. So, perhaps we need another approach.

Alternatively, since the diagonals are perpendicular, AC and BD are perpendicular, which we have already considered.

We also know that in a rhombus, the area is (AC * BD)/2, but I'm not sure if that helps here.

Wait, but perhaps we can parameterize points A and B. Let me think about parametrizing the hyperbola.

The hyperbola x²/20 - y²/24 = 1 can be parametrized using hyperbolic functions. So, let me set x = sqrt(20) * coshθ, y = sqrt(24) * sinhθ. Alternatively, since hyperbola can also be parametrized using secant and tangent functions, but perhaps hyperbolic functions are better here.

So, A can be represented as (sqrt(20) coshθ, sqrt(24) sinhθ), and since C is (-sqrt(20) coshθ, -sqrt(24) sinhθ).

Similarly, for point B, let me use another parameter φ: (sqrt(20) coshφ, sqrt(24) sinhφ), and D is (-sqrt(20) coshφ, -sqrt(24) sinhφ).

Now, since diagonals AC and BD are perpendicular, the condition is that (xu + yv) = 0.

So, substituting x = sqrt(20) coshθ, y = sqrt(24) sinhθ, u = sqrt(20) coshφ, v = sqrt(24) sinhφ.

Then,

xu + yv = (sqrt(20) coshθ)(sqrt(20) coshφ) + (sqrt(24) sinhθ)(sqrt(24) sinhφ) = 0.

Simplify this:

20 coshθ coshφ + 24 sinhθ sinhφ = 0.

So,

20 coshθ coshφ + 24 sinhθ sinhφ = 0.

Let me factor this equation:

Divide both sides by 4:

5 coshθ coshφ + 6 sinhθ sinhφ = 0.

Hmm, that's an equation involving θ and φ.

Let me think about how to solve this. Maybe using hyperbolic identities. 

I recall that cosh(a - b) = cosh a cosh b - sinh a sinh b.

But in our case, the equation is 5 coshθ coshφ + 6 sinhθ sinhφ = 0.

Hmm, maybe we can write this as:

5 coshθ coshφ = -6 sinhθ sinhφ

Divide both sides by coshθ coshφ (assuming they are non-zero):

5 = -6 (sinhθ sinhφ)/(coshθ coshφ) = -6 tanhθ tanhφ

So,

5 = -6 tanhθ tanhφ

So,

tanhθ tanhφ = -5/6.

Wait, that's interesting. So, the product of tanhθ and tanhφ is -5/6.

Hmm. So, tanhθ * tanhφ = -5/6.

Now, I need to find BD², which is 4(u² + v²) = 4*(20 cosh²φ + 24 sinh²φ).

Wait, let's compute u² + v²:

u² = 20 cosh²φ

v² = 24 sinh²φ

So, u² + v² = 20 cosh²φ + 24 sinh²φ.

We can write this as 20 (cosh²φ + sinh²φ) + 4 sinh²φ.

Wait, because 20 cosh²φ + 24 sinh²φ = 20 cosh²φ + 20 sinh²φ + 4 sinh²φ = 20 (cosh²φ + sinh²φ) + 4 sinh²φ.

But cosh²φ - sinh²φ = 1, so cosh²φ + sinh²φ = 2 sinh²φ + 1.

Alternatively, perhaps another approach. Let me compute cosh²φ and sinh²φ in terms of exponentials.

cosh²φ = (e^φ + e^{-φ})² /4 = (e^{2φ} + 2 + e^{-2φ}) /4

Similarly, sinh²φ = (e^φ - e^{-φ})² /4 = (e^{2φ} - 2 + e^{-2φ}) /4

So, u² + v² = 20 cosh²φ + 24 sinh²φ
= 20*(e^{2φ} + 2 + e^{-2φ})/4 + 24*(e^{2φ} - 2 + e^{-2φ})/4
= (20/4)(e^{2φ} + 2 + e^{-2φ}) + (24/4)(e^{2φ} - 2 + e^{-2φ})
= 5(e^{2φ} + 2 + e^{-2φ}) + 6(e^{2φ} - 2 + e^{-2φ})
= 5e^{2φ} + 10 + 5e^{-2φ} + 6e^{2φ} -12 +6e^{-2φ}
= (5e^{2φ} +6e^{2φ}) + (5e^{-2φ} +6e^{-2φ}) + (10 -12)
= 11e^{2φ} +11e^{-2φ} -2
= 11(e^{2φ} + e^{-2φ}) -2

But e^{2φ} + e^{-2φ} = 2 cosh(2φ), so:

u² + v² = 11*2 cosh(2φ) - 2 = 22 cosh(2φ) -2.

So, BD² = 4*(22 cosh(2φ) -2) = 88 cosh(2φ) -8.

Hmm, so BD² is expressed as 88 cosh(2φ) -8.

But we also have the condition that tanhθ * tanhφ = -5/6.

I need to see how θ and φ are related. Hmm, perhaps I can express tanhθ in terms of tanhφ.

Wait, from tanhθ * tanhφ = -5/6, we can write tanhθ = (-5/6) / tanhφ.

But I'm not sure if that helps. Alternatively, perhaps I can express cosh(2φ) in terms of tanhφ.

Wait, since cosh(2φ) = 1/(1 - tanh²φ).

Wait, let me recall the identity:

cosh(2φ) = (1 + tanh²φ)/(1 - tanh²φ).

Yes, because:

cosh(2φ) = 2 cosh²φ -1 = (2 tanh²φ + 2)/(1 - tanh²φ) -1

Wait, perhaps another approach.

Wait, I know that 1 + tanh²φ = sech²φ + tanh²φ = 1? Wait, no, 1 + tanh²φ = sech^{-2}φ.

Wait, no, actually, cosh²φ - sinh²φ =1, so dividing both sides by cosh²φ:

1 - tanh²φ = 1 / cosh²φ

So, 1/(1 - tanh²φ) = cosh²φ.

Hmm, not sure.

Wait, perhaps it's better to use the identity:

cosh(2φ) = (1 + tanh²φ)/(1 - tanh²φ).

Wait, let me compute:

tanh(φ) = sinhφ / coshφ.

So, let me compute (1 + tanh²φ)/(1 - tanh²φ) = (1 + (sinh²φ / cosh²φ)) / (1 - (sinh²φ / cosh²φ)) = (cosh²φ + sinh²φ)/cosh²φ / (cosh²φ - sinh²φ)/cosh²φ = (cosh²φ + sinh²φ)/(cosh²φ - sinh²φ) = (cosh²φ + sinh²φ)/1 = cosh(2φ) since cosh²φ + sinh²φ = cosh(2φ). Wait, no, cosh²φ + sinh²φ = 2 sinh²φ +1? Wait, no.

Wait, cosh(2φ) = 2 cosh²φ -1 = 2 sinh²φ +1. So, actually, cosh(2φ) = 2 cosh²φ -1, which is different from cosh²φ + sinh²φ.

Wait, let me compute cosh²φ + sinh²φ:

= (cosh²φ + sinh²φ)
= ( (e^{φ} + e^{-φ})² /4 ) + ( (e^{φ} - e^{-φ})² /4 )
= (e^{2φ} + 2 + e^{-2φ} + e^{2φ} - 2 + e^{-2φ}) /4
= (2 e^{2φ} + 2 e^{-2φ}) /4
= (e^{2φ} + e^{-2φ}) / 2
= cosh(2φ)

Ah, right! So, cosh²φ + sinh²φ = cosh(2φ).

So, from earlier, we have:

cosh(2φ) = (1 + tanh²φ)/(1 - tanh²φ)

Wait, because:

(1 + tanh²φ)/(1 - tanh²φ) = (cosh²φ + sinh²φ)/(cosh²φ - sinh²φ) = (cosh(2φ))/(1) = cosh(2φ)

Yes, that's correct.

So, we have:

cosh(2φ) = (1 + tanh²φ)/(1 - tanh²φ).

So, from tanhθ * tanhφ = -5/6, and we have cosh(2φ) in terms of tanhφ.

But how does tanhθ relate to tanhφ?

Hmm, perhaps we can express tanhθ in terms of tanhφ.

From tanhθ * tanhφ = -5/6, so tanhθ = -5/(6 tanhφ).

Wait, but that introduces θ in terms of φ, but I'm not sure if that's helpful. Alternatively, maybe we can express cosh(2φ) in terms of tanhθ and tanhφ.

Alternatively, perhaps we can find a relationship between θ and φ.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think in terms of variables. Let me denote t = tanhφ, so tanhθ = (-5/6)/t.

Then, from the expression for cosh(2φ) in terms of t:

cosh(2φ) = (1 + t²)/(1 - t²)

And we can relate this to cosh(2θ) as well, but perhaps we don't need that.

Wait, our aim is to find the minimal value of BD², which is 88 cosh(2φ) -8.

So, to minimize BD², we need to minimize cosh(2φ), because 88 is positive.

The minimal value of cosh(2φ) is 1, occurring when φ = 0. But we have the condition that tanhθ * tanhφ = -5/6.

Wait, but if φ =0, then tanhφ=0, so tanhθ * 0 = -5/6, which would imply 0 = -5/6, which is impossible. So, φ cannot be zero.

So, the minimal value of cosh(2φ) is not achievable in this case because of the constraint. Therefore, we need to find the minimal value of cosh(2φ) given that tanhθ * tanhφ = -5/6.

Wait, but how are θ and φ related? We have tanhθ = (-5/6)/tanhφ.

So, perhaps we can express cosh(2θ) in terms of tanhφ.

Wait, let me compute cosh(2θ):

cosh(2θ) = (1 + tanh²θ)/(1 - tanh²θ).

Since tanhθ = (-5/6)/t, where t = tanhφ.

So, tanh²θ = (25/36)/t².

So,

cosh(2θ) = [1 + (25/36)/t²] / [1 - (25/36)/t²] = [ (t² + 25/36) / t² ] / [ (t² -25/36)/t² ] = (t² + 25/36)/(t² -25/36)

Hmm, but I'm not sure if this helps.

Alternatively, perhaps we can consider that since points A and B lie on the hyperbola, and ABCD is a rhombus, which imposes some constraints on θ and φ.

Wait, maybe an alternative approach. Let me think about the hyperbola's geometry.

Since the hyperbola is x²/20 - y²/24 =1, its asymptotes are y = ±sqrt(24/20)x = ±sqrt(6/5)x.

The rhombus is inscribed in the hyperbola, with its diagonals intersecting at the origin.

Wait, perhaps the rhombus is symmetric with respect to both axes.

Wait, but the diagonals intersect at the origin, but they don't necessarily have to be aligned with the axes. So, the rhombus can be rotated.

Wait, but perhaps for the minimal BD², the rhombus is aligned in a way that minimizes the length of BD.

Alternatively, maybe we can parametrize the points in terms of coordinates.

Let me consider that point A is (x, y) and point B is (u, v). Then, since the diagonals are AC and BD, and they are perpendicular, we have xu + yv = 0.

But both A and B lie on the hyperbola, so x²/20 - y²/24 =1 and u²/20 - v²/24 =1.

Let me try to express u and v in terms of x and y.

Wait, from xu + yv =0, we can write u = (-yv)/x.

But then, substituting into the hyperbola equation for B:

u²/20 - v²/24 =1

So, [ (y² v²)/(x²) ] /20 - v²/24 =1

Multiply through by 20*24*x² to eliminate denominators:

24 y² v² - 20*20 x² v² =20*24 x²

Hmm, this seems complicated. Maybe an alternative approach.

Alternatively, since points A and B lie on the hyperbola, and the diagonals are perpendicular, perhaps we can use the concept of conjugate points or something similar.

Wait, another approach: Let's consider that in a rhombus, the sides are equal and the diagonals bisect each other at right angles. So, if we take the origin as the midpoint, then the coordinates are as we defined before.

In this case, the vectors OA and OB must satisfy OA · OB =0 (since diagonals are perpendicular). So, OA · OB =0. Wait, but earlier, we found that xu + yv =0, which is the dot product of OA and OB being zero. So, OA is perpendicular to OB.

Wait a minute, so OA and OB are perpendicular vectors. So, the points A and B are such that OA is perpendicular to OB, and both lie on the hyperbola.

So, the problem reduces to finding two points A and B on the hyperbola x²/20 - y²/24 =1 such that OA is perpendicular to OB, and then finding the minimal BD², which is 4(u² + v²). Since BD² = 4(u² + v²), and u² + v² is the square of the distance from the origin to point B, which we can denote as |OB|².

So, the problem becomes: Find the minimal possible value of |OB|² for points B on the hyperbola such that OA is perpendicular to OB, where A is also on the hyperbola.

Wait, but if OA is perpendicular to OB, and both A and B are on the hyperbola, then perhaps we can use the concept of reciprocal hyperbolas or something related.

Alternatively, perhaps we can consider that for any point B on the hyperbola, the condition that OA is perpendicular to OB imposes a constraint on A. But since A is also on the hyperbola, this might lead us to a relation between A and B.

Wait, perhaps it's better to parameterize A and B as points on the hyperbola with OA perpendicular to OB.

So, suppose A is (x, y) and B is (u, v) on the hyperbola, with xu + yv =0.

So, xu + yv =0.

We can think of points A and B as being such that the product of their coordinates satisfies this condition.

I think we can use Lagrange multipliers here to minimize |OB|² = u² + v², subject to u²/20 - v²/24 =1 and xu + yv =0, where (x, y) is another point on the hyperbola.

But this seems complicated because we have two variables (u, v) and another point (x, y). Maybe we can eliminate variables.

Wait, from xu + yv =0, we can express v = (-xu)/y. Substituting into the hyperbola equation for B:

u²/20 - v²/24 =1
= u²/20 - (x² u²)/(y² *24) =1
= u² [1/20 - x²/(24 y²)] =1

Let me compute the coefficient:

1/20 - x²/(24 y²) = (24 y² - 20 x²)/(20*24 y²)

But since A is on the hyperbola, x²/20 - y²/24 =1, so x² = 20(1 + y²/24). Substitute this into the coefficient:

24 y² -20*(20(1 + y²/24))/24

Wait, wait, let's compute numerator:

24 y² -20 x².

But x² = 20(1 + y²/24) =20 + (20 y²)/24 =20 + (5 y²)/6

So,

24 y² -20 x² =24 y² -20*(20 + (5 y²)/6)
=24 y² -400 - (100 y²)/6
=24 y² -400 - (50 y²)/3
Convert 24 y² to thirds: 72 y²/3 -50 y²/3 =22 y²/3
So,

22 y²/3 -400

So, the coefficient becomes:

(22 y²/3 -400)/(20*24 y²) = (22 y² -1200)/(3*20*24 y²) = (22 y² -1200)/(1440 y²)

So, back to the equation:

u² [ (22 y² -1200)/(1440 y²) ] =1

So,

u² = 1440 y² / (22 y² -1200)

So, u² = (1440 y²)/(22 y² -1200)

Hmm, so u² is expressed in terms of y².

Similarly, from v = (-xu)/y, and x² =20 + (5 y²)/6, so x = sqrt(20 + (5 y²)/6).

Wait, but this is getting complicated. Maybe instead, let's consider that since x²/20 - y²/24 =1, we can write x² =20 + (5 y²)/6.

So, x² =20 + (5 y²)/6.

So, going back to the condition xu + yv =0 and the hyperbola equation for B.

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to consider that if OA is perpendicular to OB, then the product of their slopes is -1.

Wait, the slope of OA is y/x, and the slope of OB is v/u. So, (y/x)*(v/u) = -1. So,

(yv)/(xu) = -1

Which implies yv = -xu, which is consistent with what we had earlier: xu + yv =0.

So, perhaps using this condition, we can parameterize B in terms of A.

Alternatively, perhaps using parametric coordinates for hyperbola.

Let me consider parametrizing point A as (sqrt(20) secθ, sqrt(24) tanθ). Similarly, since point B is on the hyperbola, and OA is perpendicular to OB, we can parametrize B as (sqrt(20) secφ, sqrt(24) tanφ), but with the condition that OA · OB =0.

Wait, using trigonometric parametrization for hyperbola, but I have to be careful because hyperbola parametrization usually uses hyperbolic functions, not trigonometric. Trigonometric parametrization would actually be an ellipse. So, perhaps not the best approach.

Alternatively, let me think about the reflection properties.

Wait, perhaps another approach: Let me consider that points A and B lie on the hyperbola, and OA is perpendicular to OB. So, the product of their slopes is -1.

The slope of OA is y/x, so the slope of OB must be -x/y.

So, for point B, which is (u, v), its slope is v/u = -x/y.

So, v/u = -x/y => v = (-x/y) u.

So, substituting into the hyperbola equation for B:

u²/20 - v²/24 =1
= u²/20 - (x² u²)/(y² *24) =1
= u² [1/20 - x²/(24 y²)] =1

Which is the same as before.

So, the term in brackets is 1/20 - x²/(24 y²). From the equation of the hyperbola, x²/20 - y²/24 =1, so x² =20 + (5 y²)/6.

Substituting x² into the term:

1/20 - (20 + (5 y²)/6)/(24 y²)
=1/20 - [20/(24 y²) + (5 y²)/(6*24 y²)]
=1/20 - [5/(6 y²) +5/(144)]
=1/20 -5/(6 y²) -5/144

Combine the constants:

1/20 = 7.2/144
5/144 is as is.

So,

=7.2/144 -5/(6 y²) -5/144
= (7.2 -5)/144 -5/(6 y²)
=2.2/144 -5/(6 y²)
=11/720 -5/(6 y²)

Hmm, this seems complicated. Alternatively, maybe I should compute this fraction step by step.

Wait, let's compute 1/20 - x²/(24 y²) with x² =20 + (5 y²)/6.

So,

1/20 - [20 + (5 y²)/6]/(24 y²)

=1/20 - [20/(24 y²) + (5 y²)/(6*24 y²)]

=1/20 - [ (5)/(6 y²) +5/(144) ]

So, this is 1/20 -5/(6 y²) -5/144.

Combine the constants:

1/20 = 7.2/144, and 5/144 is 5/144.

So,

7.2/144 -5/144 =2.2/144 =11/720.

So, the term becomes 11/720 -5/(6 y²).

So, putting it back into the equation:

u² [11/720 -5/(6 y²)] =1

So,

u² = 1 / [11/720 -5/(6 y²)] = 1 / [ (11 - 600/(6 y²)) /720 ]

Wait, let me compute the denominator:

11/720 -5/(6 y²) = (11 y² - 600)/(720 y²)

So,

u² = 1 / [ (11 y² -600)/(720 y²) ] = 720 y² / (11 y² -600)

So, u² = 720 y² / (11 y² -600)

Now, since u² must be positive, the denominator must be positive:

11 y² -600 >0 => y² >600/11.

So, y² >600/11≈54.545.

But since point A is on the hyperbola, y² can be any positive number, as long as x² is positive.

Wait, but for the hyperbola x²/20 - y²/24 =1, x² must be at least 20, so y² can be any value greater than or equal to 0. But in our case, since y² has to be greater than 600/11≈54.545, that's acceptable.

So, now, we can express u² in terms of y². Then, since BD² is 4(u² +v²), and we have v = (-xu)/y, so v² = (x² u²)/y².

So, v² = (x² u²)/y².

But x² =20 + (5 y²)/6.

So,

v² = [20 + (5 y²)/6] * u² / y²

= [ (120 +5 y²)/6 ] * u² / y²

= (120 +5 y²) u² / (6 y² )

So, BD² =4(u² +v²) =4[ u² + (120 +5 y²) u² / (6 y² ) ]

=4 u² [1 + (120 +5 y²)/(6 y²) ]

=4 u² [ (6 y² +120 +5 y² ) / (6 y²) ]

=4 u² [ (11 y² +120 ) / (6 y² ) ]

Now, substitute u² from earlier: u²=720 y²/(11 y² -600)

So,

BD² =4 * [720 y²/(11 y² -600) ] * [ (11 y² +120 ) / (6 y² ) ]

Simplify step by step.

First, let's compute the constants:

4 *720 /6 =4*120=480.

So,

BD² =480 * [ y²/(11 y² -600) ] * [ (11 y² +120 ) / y² ]

The y² cancels out:

=480 * [ (11 y² +120 ) / (11 y² -600) ]

So,

BD² =480 * (11 y² +120 ) / (11 y² -600 )

Let me denote z=11 y² -600, then 11 y² = z +600.

So,

BD² =480 * (z +600 +120 ) / z =480*(z +720)/z =480*(1 +720/z )

=480 + 480*720/z

But z=11 y² -600, so z>0 (since y²>600/11).

So, BD² =480 + (480*720)/(11 y² -600 )

Now, to minimize BD², we need to minimize this expression.

Since 480 is a constant, we need to minimize the second term, which is (480*720)/(11 y² -600). To minimize this, we need to maximize the denominator (11 y² -600).

But as y² increases, 11 y² -600 increases, making the second term smaller. Therefore, the minimal BD² occurs when the denominator is as large as possible, which would be as y² approaches infinity.

But wait, as y² approaches infinity, the second term approaches zero, so BD² approaches 480. So, BD² can get as close to 480 as possible, but can't be less than 480.

Wait, but wait, let's check when y² is just above 600/11. Let's compute BD² when y² approaches 600/11 from above.

When y² approaches 600/11, 11 y² -600 approaches 0 from above. So, the second term (480*720)/(11 y² -600) approaches infinity. So, BD² approaches infinity. Therefore, BD² is unbounded above but has a lower bound.

Wait, but this contradicts our previous conclusion. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, looking back, BD² =480 + (480*720)/(11 y² -600 )

As y² increases beyond 600/11, 11 y² -600 increases, so the fraction (480*720)/(11 y² -600) decreases, meaning BD² decreases towards 480.

So, the minimal BD² is 480, approached as y² becomes large. But BD² can't be less than 480 because as y² increases, BD² approaches 480 from above.

Wait, but if BD² approaches 480 from above, then 480 is the infimum, the greatest lower bound. So, the greatest real number less than BD² for all such rhombi would be 480, but BD² can be made arbitrarily close to 480. Therefore, 480 is the infimum, so the greatest number less than BD² for all rhombi is 480.

Wait, but wait, let me think again. If BD² can be made arbitrarily close to 480, then 480 is the infimum, but BD² can be equal to 480? Or is it just approaching it? Because when y² approaches infinity, BD² approaches 480, but never actually reaches it. Therefore, 480 is the infimum, and the greatest real number less than BD² for all rhombi is 480.

Wait, but let me verify this with actual computation. Let me take a very large y² and compute BD².

Let me choose y² = 600/11 + ε, where ε is a very small positive number.

Then, z =11 y² -600 =11*(600/11 + ε) -600=600 +11ε -600=11ε.

So,

BD²=480 + (480*720)/(11ε)

As ε approaches zero, BD² approaches infinity. Wait, that can't be right because earlier analysis suggested that BD² approaches 480 as y² approaches infinity.

Wait, perhaps I made an error in substitution.

Wait, when y² is very large, z=11 y² -600 is approximately 11 y², so BD²≈480 + (480*720)/(11 y²)

As y² approaches infinity, (480*720)/(11 y²) approaches zero, so BD² approaches 480.

Wait, but earlier when y² approaches 600/11, z approaches zero, and BD² approaches infinity.

So, the minimal value of BD² is 480, but it's approached as y² becomes very large. So, BD² can be as close to 480 as desired, but never less than 480. Therefore, 480 is the infimum.

Therefore, the greatest real number less than BD² for all such rhombi is 480.

Wait, but let me double-check this result because the problem is about a hyperbola, and rhombus inscribed in it. So, perhaps I can think of specific points.

Alternatively, maybe I can use another approach to find the minimal BD².

Since BD² =4(u² +v²), and u²/20 -v²/24=1.

We can express BD² in terms of u² and v²:

From the hyperbola equation, u² =20(1 +v²/24)

So, BD² =4(u² +v²)=4[20(1 +v²/24) +v²]=4[20 + (20 v²)/24 +v²]=4[20 + (5 v²)/6 +v²]=4[20 + (11 v²)/6]

=80 + (44 v²)/6=80 + (22 v²)/3

So, BD² =80 + (22 v²)/3

To minimize BD², we need to minimize v².

But since point B is on the hyperbola, v² can be as small as possible, but subject to the condition that OA · OB =0.

But wait, point A is also on the hyperbola, and OA · OB=0.

Wait, but if we minimize v², what happens? Let's see.

Wait, from BD²=80 + (22 v²)/3, to minimize BD², we need to minimize v², but subject to the condition that OA is perpendicular to OB.

So, perhaps the minimal v² occurs when OA is perpendicular to OB, which might correspond to a specific point.

Alternatively, perhaps we can consider that for minimal BD², the point B is as close to the origin as possible, but still satisfying the hyperbola equation and OA · OB=0.

Wait, but the minimal distance from the origin to a point on the hyperbola is the vertex, which is at x=±sqrt(20), y=0. But in that case, point B would be (sqrt(20),0), and point A would have to satisfy OA · OB=0. So, OA would have to be a point such that (x,y)·(sqrt(20),0)=0, which implies x*sqrt(20) +0=0 => x=0.

But x=0 can't be on the hyperbola x²/20 - y²/24=1, because plugging x=0 gives -y²/24=1 => y²=-24, which is impossible. So, point B can't be at (sqrt(20),0) because then point A would have to be at (0, y), which isn't possible.

So, the minimal v² occurs at some other point.

Wait, perhaps instead of trying to minimize v², we can use the condition xu + yv=0 with x²/20 - y²/24=1 and u²/20 -v²/24=1, and find the minimum of BD²=4(u² +v²).

Alternatively, perhaps using Lagrange multipliers.

Let me set up the problem: minimize f(u, v) = u² +v², subject to the constraints g(u, v) = u²/20 -v²/24 -1=0 and h(x, y, u, v)=xu + yv=0, where (x,y) is on the hyperbola x²/20 - y²/24=1.

But this seems complicated because we have multiple variables.

Alternatively, perhaps we can express x and y in terms of u and v.

From xu + yv=0, we can express x = (-yv)/u.

Substituting into the hyperbola equation for A: x²/20 - y²/24=1.

So,

[ (y² v²)/(u²) ] /20 - y²/24=1

Which is,

y² v²/(20 u²) - y²/24=1

Factor y²:

y² [v²/(20 u²) -1/24] =1

But from the hyperbola equation for B: u²/20 -v²/24=1, we can express v²= (24/20)(u² -1)= (6/5)(u² -1)

Wait, wait:

From u²/20 -v²/24=1,

Multiply both sides by 24*20=480:

24 u² -20 v²=480

So,

24 u² -20 v²=480

Divide both sides by 4:

6 u² -5 v²=120

So,

5 v²=6 u² -120

Thus,

v²=(6 u² -120)/5

So, plugging back into the equation for A:

y² [v²/(20 u²) -1/24] =1

= y² [ ((6 u² -120)/5 )/(20 u²) -1/24 ] =1

Simplify inside the brackets:

= [ (6 u² -120)/(5*20 u²) -1/24 ]

= [ (6 u² -120)/(100 u²) -1/24 ]

Let me compute each term:

(6 u² -120)/(100 u²)= (6(u² -20))/(100 u²)= (3(u² -20))/(50 u²)

So,

= (3(u² -20))/(50 u²) -1/24

To combine these, find a common denominator, which would be 600 u².

= [3(u² -20)*12 -50 u²]/600 u²

= [36(u² -20) -50 u²]/600 u²

= [36 u² -720 -50 u²]/600 u²

= (-14 u² -720)/600 u²

= - (14 u² +720)/600 u²

So, the equation becomes:

y² [ - (14 u² +720)/600 u² ] =1

Which implies:

y² = -600 u² / (14 u² +720 )

But y² must be positive, so the RHS must be positive. Therefore,

-600 u² / (14 u² +720 ) >0

But numerator is negative, denominator is positive (since u² is positive), so overall negative. Which can't be, since y² is positive.

So, this suggests that there's no solution, which contradicts our initial assumption. Therefore, perhaps an error was made in the algebra.

Wait, let me retrace.

From the equation:

y² [v²/(20 u²) -1/24] =1

We substituted v²=(6 u² -120)/5.

So,

[ (6 u² -120)/5 ]/(20 u²) -1/24

= (6 u² -120)/(100 u²) -1/24

= [ (6 u² -120) *24 -100 u² ] / (2400 u² )

Compute numerator:

(6 u² -120)*24 =144 u² -2880

Subtract 100 u²: 144 u² -2880 -100 u²=44 u² -2880

So,

[44 u² -2880]/(2400 u² )

So,

y² [ (44 u² -2880)/(2400 u² ) ] =1

Thus,

y² = 2400 u² / (44 u² -2880 )

Simplify numerator and denominator:

Divide numerator and denominator by 4:

=600 u²/(11 u² -720 )

So,

y²=600 u²/(11 u² -720 )

Now, since y² must be positive, the denominator must be positive:

11 u² -720 >0 => u²>720/11≈65.4545.

So, u² must be greater than 720/11.

So, now, we have y²=600 u²/(11 u² -720 )

Now, from the hyperbola equation for A: x²/20 - y²/24=1

We can express x²=20(1 + y²/24)

Substituting y²:

x²=20[1 + (600 u²)/(24(11 u² -720 )) ]

=20[1 + (25 u²)/(11 u² -720 ) ]

=20[ (11 u² -720 +25 u² ) / (11 u² -720 ) ]

=20[ (36 u² -720 ) / (11 u² -720 ) ]

=20*36(u² -20 ) / (11 u² -720 )

=720(u² -20 ) / (11 u² -720 )

So, x²=720(u² -20 )/(11 u² -720 )

Now, going back to BD²=4(u² +v² )

From earlier, v²=(6 u² -120)/5.

So,

BD²=4[ u² + (6 u² -120)/5 ]=4[ (5 u² +6 u² -120 )/5 ]=4[ (11 u² -120 )/5 ]= (44 u² -480 )/5= (44 u² -480)/5

So, BD²= (44 u² -480)/5

We need to minimize this expression with respect to u², given that u²>720/11.

So, BD²= (44 u² -480)/5.

To minimize BD², we need to minimize u².

The minimal u² is just above 720/11≈65.4545.

So, as u² approaches 720/11 from above, BD² approaches:

(44*(720/11) -480)/5 = (44*720)/(11*5) -480/5

= (44*720)/(55) -96

= (44/55)*720 -96

= (4/5)*720 -96

= 576 -96=480.

So, as u² approaches 720/11, BD² approaches 480.

Therefore, the minimal BD² is 480, approached as u² approaches 720/11 from above.

Thus, the greatest real number less than BD² for all such rhombi is 480.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To solve the problem, we analyze the rhombus inscribed in the hyperbola \( \frac{x^2}{20} - \frac{y^2}{24} = 1 \) with diagonals intersecting at the origin. The goal is to find the greatest real number less than \( BD^2 \) for all such rhombi.

1. **Hyperbola and Rhombus Properties**:
   - The hyperbola is centered at the origin with \( a^2 = 20 \) and \( b^2 = 24 \).
   - The rhombus \( ABCD \) has diagonals intersecting at the origin, implying the origin is the midpoint of both diagonals.
   - The diagonals are perpendicular, so the dot product of vectors \( \overrightarrow{AC} \) and \( \overrightarrow{BD} \) is zero.

2. **Parametrization and Conditions**:
   - Points \( A \) and \( B \) lie on the hyperbola: \( \frac{x^2}{20} - \frac{y^2}{24} = 1 \).
   - The diagonals \( AC \) and \( BD \) are perpendicular, leading to the condition \( xu + yv = 0 \) where \( A = (x, y) \) and \( B = (u, v) \).

3. **Expression for \( BD^2 \)**:
   - The length of diagonal \( BD \) is \( 2\sqrt{u^2 + v^2} \), so \( BD^2 = 4(u^2 + v^2) \).
   - Using the hyperbola equation for \( B \), \( u^2/20 - v^2/24 = 1 \), we express \( v^2 \) in terms of \( u^2 \): \( v^2 = \frac{6u^2 - 120}{5} \).

4. **Minimizing \( BD^2 \)**:
   - Substitute \( v^2 \) into \( BD^2 \) to get \( BD^2 = \frac{44u^2 - 480}{5} \).
   - The minimum value of \( BD^2 \) occurs as \( u^2 \) approaches its minimum value, which is just above \( \frac{720}{11} \). This leads \( BD^2 \) to approach 480.

5. **Conclusion**:
   - The greatest real number less than \( BD^2 \) for all such rhombi is **480**.

\boxed{480}
