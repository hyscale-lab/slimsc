Okay, so I've got this math problem here, and I need to find the product of x and y, given that both are real numbers greater than 1. The problem states that log base x of y^x is equal to 10, and log base y of x^{4y} is also equal to 10. Hmm, that's a bit to unpack, but I'll try to take it step by step.

First, I remember that logarithms can be tricky, but they have certain properties that can help simplify these expressions. Let me write down the given equations to make it clearer.

The first equation is:
log_x(y^x) = 10

And the second equation is:
log_y(x^{4y}) = 10

Alright, so I have two logarithmic equations, both equal to 10. Let me try to simplify each of them using logarithm properties.

Starting with the first equation: log_x(y^x). I remember that log_b(a^k) = k * log_b(a). So applying that here, I can bring the exponent x in front of the logarithm. That would give me:

x * log_x(y) = 10

Similarly, for the second equation: log_y(x^{4y}). Again, applying the same logarithm power rule, I can write this as:

4y * log_y(x) = 10

So now I have two equations:

1. x * log_x(y) = 10
2. 4y * log_y(x) = 10

Hmm, okay. I notice that both equations involve logarithms of y with base x and logarithms of x with base y. I also remember that log_b(a) is equal to 1 / log_a(b). So, log_x(y) is the reciprocal of log_y(x). Let me denote log_x(y) as some variable to make it easier. Let's say:

Let’s let a = log_x(y). Then, log_y(x) would be 1/a.

Substituting this into the equations:

1. x * a = 10
2. 4y * (1/a) = 10

So, equation 1 is x*a = 10, and equation 2 is (4y)/a = 10.

Now, I have two equations with two variables, x and y, and the parameter a. Maybe I can express x and y in terms of a and then find a relationship between them.

From equation 1: x = 10 / a

From equation 2: (4y)/a = 10 => 4y = 10a => y = (10a)/4 => y = (5a)/2

So now I have x in terms of a and y in terms of a. Let me write that down:

x = 10 / a

y = (5a)/2

But since a is log_x(y), which is equal to log base x of y, maybe I can express a in terms of x and y. But wait, I already have a in terms of x and y through these equations. Alternatively, I can use the fact that a = log_x(y) and express y in terms of x and a to create an equation.

Wait, since a = log_x(y), by the definition of logarithms, this means that x^a = y.

So y = x^a.

But I also have from above that y = (5a)/2. So now I can set x^a equal to (5a)/2:

x^a = (5a)/2

But from earlier, x = 10 / a. So substitute that into the equation:

(10 / a)^a = (5a)/2

Hmm, that looks a bit complicated, but maybe I can work with it. Let me simplify the left side:

(10 / a)^a = (10^a) / (a^a)

So now the equation is:

10^a / a^a = (5a)/2

Let me cross-multiply to eliminate fractions:

2 * 10^a = 5a * a^a

Wait, 5a * a^a is the same as 5a^{a+1}, because when you multiply a by a^a, you add exponents: a^{1} * a^{a} = a^{a+1}.

So:

2 * 10^a = 5a^{a+1}

Divide both sides by 5 to simplify:

(2/5) * 10^a = a^{a+1}

Hmm, this equation is still quite complex because it has both a and a^{a+1}, which is a variable in the exponent. Maybe taking logarithms on both sides could help. Let me think.

Let me take the natural logarithm of both sides:

ln[(2/5) * 10^a] = ln(a^{a+1})

Using logarithm properties, ln(ab) = ln a + ln b, so:

ln(2/5) + ln(10^a) = (a+1) * ln(a)

Simplify ln(10^a) to a ln(10):

ln(2/5) + a ln(10) = (a + 1) ln(a)

Hmm, that's still a complicated equation because it involves both a and ln(a). It might not be straightforward to solve algebraically. Perhaps I can make an intelligent guess for the value of a. Let me see if a is an integer or a simple fraction.

Looking back at the equations:

We had x = 10/a and y = (5a)/2. Also, from y = x^a, we had y = (10/a)^a = (5a)/2. So maybe a is a nice integer? Let's try a=2.

If a=2, then:

x = 10/2 =5

y = (5*2)/2 =5

Then, check if y =x^a: 5 =5^2? 5^2 is 25, which is not equal to 5. So a=2 doesn't work.

Wait, maybe a=1? Let's check a=1.

x=10/1=10

y=(5*1)/2=2.5

Check if y=x^a: 2.5 =10^1=10? No, 2.5 is not 10. So a=1 doesn't work.

How about a=3?

x=10/3 ≈3.333

y=(5*3)/2=7.5

Check y=x^a: 7.5 ≈(10/3)^3 ≈ (1000)/(27)≈37.037. Not equal. So a=3 is too big.

Hmm, maybe a= something else. Let me try a= 3/2 =1.5

Then x=10/(1.5)=20/3≈6.666

y=(5*1.5)/2=7.5/2=3.75

Check y =x^a: 3.75≈(20/3)^(1.5)

Compute (20/3)^1.5 = sqrt( (20/3)^3 )

(20/3)^3 = (8000)/(27) ≈296.296

Square root of that is approximately 17.21, which is way bigger than 3.75. So no, a=1.5 is not right.

Alternatively, maybe a= something like 0.5? Wait, but a is log_x(y). Since x and y are both greater than 1, log_x(y) can be greater than 0 but can be less than 1 or greater than 1. Hmm, but if a were 0.5, then:

x=10/0.5=20

y=(5*0.5)/2=2.5/2=1.25

Check y= x^a: 1.25=20^0.5= sqrt(20)≈4.472, which is not equal to 1.25. So no.

Alternatively, maybe a=4?

x=10/4=2.5

y=(5*4)/2=10

Check y=x^a: 10=2.5^4= (2.5)^2 * (2.5)^2=6.25*6.25=39.0625. Not equal. So a=4 is not working.

Hmm, maybe a= what? Alternatively, perhaps I can think of a different approach.

Wait, let me think again about the original equations. Maybe instead of substituting a, I can relate x and y directly.

We have the two equations:

1. x * log_x(y) =10
2. 4y * log_y(x)=10

But since log_x(y) =1 / log_y(x), let's denote log_y(x) as b. Then log_x(y) =1/b.

So equation 1 becomes: x*(1/b) =10 --> x =10b

Equation 2: 4y * b=10 --> y=10/(4b)=5/(2b)

So now, x=10b and y=5/(2b)

But since y =x^a, and a = log_x(y) =1/b, so:

y =x^{1/b}

But y=5/(2b) and x=10b, so substitute:

5/(2b) = (10b)^{1/b}

Hmm, this seems similar to the previous substitution. Maybe take both sides to the power of b:

(5/(2b))^b =10b

Hmm, but not sure if that helps. Let me take natural logs:

ln(5/(2b)) * b = ln(10b)

Which is:

b [ ln(5) - ln(2b) ] = ln(10) + ln(b)

Expanding:

b ln(5) - b ln(2b) = ln(10) + ln(b)

But ln(2b)=ln2 + ln b, so:

b ln5 - b (ln2 + ln b) = ln10 + ln b

Simplify:

b ln5 - b ln2 - b ln b = ln10 + ln b

Bring all terms to left:

b ln5 - b ln2 - b ln b - ln10 - ln b =0

Factor where possible:

b (ln5 - ln2 - ln b) - ln10 - ln b =0

Hmm, this seems complicated. Maybe I'll try to find b numerically. Let's see if I can make an educated guess.

Let me choose b=1:

Then,

Left side: 1*(ln5 - ln2 - ln1) - ln10 - ln1 = (ln5 - ln2) - ln10 -0

ln5≈1.609, ln2≈0.693, ln10≈2.302

So: (1.609 -0.693) -2.302 ≈0.916 -2.302≈-1.386 ≠0

So not zero. b=1 doesn't work.

How about b=2:

Left side: 2*(ln5 - ln2 - ln2) - ln10 - ln2

Compute each part:

ln5≈1.609, ln2≈0.693, ln10≈2.302

So inside the bracket: 1.609 -0.693 -0.693=1.609 -1.386≈0.223

Multiply by 2: 0.446

Then subtract ln10 + ln2 ≈2.302 + 0.693≈3. So total: 0.446 -3≈-2.554≠0

Still not zero.

b=0.5:

Left side: 0.5*(ln5 - ln2 - ln0.5) - ln10 - ln0.5

ln0.5≈-0.693

So inside the bracket: 1.609 -0.693 - (-0.693)=1.609 -0.693 +0.693=1.609

Multiply by 0.5: 0.8045

Then subtract ln10 + ln0.5≈2.302 + (-0.693)=1.609

So total:0.8045 -1.609≈-0.8045≈ -0.805≠0

Not zero.

How about b=1.5:

Compute each part:

ln5≈1.609, ln2≈0.693, ln1.5≈0.4055, ln10≈2.302

Inside the bracket: 1.609 -0.693 -0.4055≈1.609 -1.0985≈0.5105

Multiply by 1.5: 0.76575

Then subtract ln10 + ln1.5≈2.302 +0.4055≈2.7075

So total:0.76575 -2.7075≈-1.94175≠0

Still negative.

Hmm, perhaps b is less than 1. Maybe b=0.7:

Compute:

Inside the bracket: 1.609 -0.693 - ln0.7 ≈1.609 -0.693 - (-0.3567)≈1.609 -0.693 +0.3567≈1.609 -0.3363≈1.2727

Multiply by b=0.7:≈0.8909

Subtract ln10 + ln0.7≈2.302 + (-0.3567)=1.9453

So total:0.8909 -1.9453≈-1.0544≠0

Hmm, maybe b=0.6:

Inside bracket:1.609 -0.693 - ln0.6≈1.609 -0.693 - (-0.5108)=1.609 -0.693 +0.5108≈1.609 -0.1822≈1.4268

Multiply by 0.6:≈0.8561

Subtract ln10 + ln0.6≈2.302 + (-0.5108)=1.7912

So total:0.8561 -1.7912≈-0.9351≠0

Hmm, not working. Maybe I need a different approach. Let's think about the original variables.

We had x=10b and y=5/(2b). Also, since y =x^{1/b}, substituting x:

y= (10b)^{1/b}

But y is also 5/(2b). So:

(10b)^{1/b} =5/(2b)

Hmm, let me take both sides to the power of b:

(10b) = (5/(2b))^b

So,

10b = (5/(2b))^b

Hmm, perhaps I can take natural logs again:

ln(10b) = b * ln(5/(2b))

Which is:

ln10 + ln b = b*(ln5 - ln2 - ln b)

Wait, this seems similar to the equation I had earlier.

Alternatively, let me write this as:

ln10 + lnb = b ln5 - b ln2 - b ln b

Bring all terms to left:

ln10 + ln b - b ln5 + b ln2 + b ln b =0

Hmm, maybe factor terms with b:

(-b ln5 + b ln2 + b ln b) + ln10 + ln b=0

Which is:

b(-ln5 + ln2 + ln b) + ln10 + ln b=0

This is getting me back to where I was before. Maybe instead of trying to solve algebraically, I can try to approximate numerically.

Let me define a function f(b) = b(-ln5 + ln2 + ln b) + ln10 + ln b

We need to find b where f(b)=0.

We can try to find approximate roots by testing values.

Earlier, when b=1: f(1) =1*(-1.609 +0.693 +0) +2.302 +0= ( -0.916 ) +2.302≈1.386>0

Wait, wait, let me recompute f(b):

Wait, the function f(b)=b*(-ln5 + ln2 + ln b) + ln10 + ln b

So, for b=1:

f(1)=1*(-ln5 + ln2 + ln1) + ln10 + ln1

But ln1=0, so:

=1*(-1.609 +0.693 +0) +2.302 +0

=1*(-0.916) +2.302≈-0.916 +2.302≈1.386>0

Wait, earlier when I tried b=1, I thought the result was negative, but that's because I was using a different function. So actually, at b=1, f(b)=1.386>0.

At b=2:

f(2)=2*(-ln5 + ln2 + ln2) + ln10 + ln2

Compute inside the brackets:

-ln5≈-1.609, ln2≈0.693, so:

-1.609 +0.693 +0.693≈-1.609 +1.386≈-0.223

Multiply by 2: -0.446

ln10≈2.302, ln2≈0.693, so:

f(2)= -0.446 +2.302 +0.693≈-0.446 +2.995≈2.549>0

So f(2)=2.549>0.

Wait, but when I tried b=1, the previous function was negative, but this function is positive. I must have confused the functions earlier.

Wait, perhaps I need to re-examine my function definitions. Let me go back.

Wait, the function f(b) I defined was:

f(b) = b*(-ln5 + ln2 + ln b) + ln10 + ln b

But when I substituted b=1, I get:

f(1) =1*(-1.609 +0.693 +0) +2.302 +0≈1*(-0.916)+2.302≈-0.916 +2.302≈1.386>0

Similarly, at b=0.5:

f(0.5)=0.5*(-1.609 +0.693 + ln0.5) +2.302 + ln0.5

Compute ln0.5≈-0.693

So inside the brackets:

-1.609 +0.693 -0.693≈-1.609

Multiply by 0.5: -0.8045

Then, ln10≈2.302, ln0.5≈-0.693

So f(0.5)= -0.8045 +2.302 -0.693≈-0.8045 +1.609≈0.8045>0

So at b=0.5, f(b)=0.8045>0

At b=0.25:

f(0.25)=0.25*(-1.609 +0.693 + ln0.25) +2.302 + ln0.25

ln0.25≈-1.386

So inside the brackets:

-1.609 +0.693 -1.386≈-1.609 -0.693≈-2.302

Multiply by 0.25:≈-0.5755

Then, ln10≈2.302, ln0.25≈-1.386

So f(0.25)= -0.5755 +2.302 -1.386≈-0.5755 +0.916≈0.3405>0

Hmm, still positive.

Wait, but as b approaches zero, what happens to f(b)?

As b approaches zero from the positive side, ln b approaches negative infinity. So the term b*(...) would be:

b*(-1.609 +0.693 + ln b) →0*(-something) which is 0.

But ln10 + ln b approaches ln10 + (-infty)= -infty. So f(b) approaches -infty as b→0+.

Which suggests that somewhere between b=0 and b approaching 0, f(b) goes from -infty to 0.3405 at b=0.25. So there must be a root between b=0 and b=0.25.

But wait, when I computed f(0.25)=0.3405>0, so between b=0 and b=0.25, f(b) goes from -infty to 0.3405, so it must cross zero somewhere in between.

Similarly, at b=0.1:

Compute f(0.1):

f(0.1)=0.1*(-1.609 +0.693 + ln0.1) +2.302 + ln0.1

ln0.1≈-2.302

So inside the brackets:

-1.609 +0.693 -2.302≈-1.609 -1.609≈-3.218

Multiply by 0.1:≈-0.3218

Adding ln10≈2.302 and ln0.1≈-2.302:

f(0.1)= -0.3218 +2.302 -2.302≈-0.3218

So f(0.1)=≈-0.3218<0

So now, between b=0.1 and b=0.25, f(b) goes from -0.3218 to 0.3405. So by Intermediate Value Theorem, there's a root between 0.1 and 0.25.

Let me try b=0.15:

f(0.15)=0.15*(-1.609 +0.693 + ln0.15) +2.302 + ln0.15

ln0.15≈-1.897

So inside the brackets:

-1.609 +0.693 -1.897≈-1.609 -1.204≈-2.813

Multiply by 0.15:≈-0.42195

Adding ln10≈2.302 and ln0.15≈-1.897:

f(0.15)= -0.42195 +2.302 -1.897≈-0.42195 +0.405≈-0.01695≈-0.017

Almost zero. So f(0.15)≈-0.017

Close to zero. Let's try b=0.16:

ln0.16≈-1.823

Inside the brackets:

-1.609 +0.693 -1.823≈-1.609 -1.13≈-2.739

Multiply by 0.16:≈-0.4382

Adding ln10≈2.302 and ln0.16≈-1.823:

f(0.16)= -0.4382 +2.302 -1.823≈-0.4382 +0.479≈0.0408

So f(0.16)≈0.0408>0

So between b=0.15 and b=0.16, f(b) crosses zero.

Let's approximate using linear approximation.

At b=0.15: f=-0.017

At b=0.16: f=0.0408

The change in b is 0.01, and the change in f is 0.0408 - (-0.017)=0.0578

We need to find delta where f=0.

The slope is 0.0578 per 0.01 change.

We need to cover from -0.017 to 0, which is 0.017.

So delta= (0.017 / 0.0578)*0.01≈(0.294)*0.01≈0.00294

So approximate root at b=0.15 +0.00294≈0.15294≈0.153

So approximately, b≈0.153

Then, x=10b≈10*0.153≈1.53

y=5/(2b)=5/(2*0.153)≈5/0.306≈16.34

Wait, but earlier, we had y= x^{1/b}.

Let me check if y≈16.34 with x≈1.53 and b≈0.153.

Compute x^{1/b}=1.53^(1/0.153)≈1.53^6.536

Calculate 1.53^6≈1.53*1.53=2.34, 2.34*1.53≈3.58, 3.58*1.53≈5.47, 5.47*1.53≈8.37, 8.37*1.53≈12.81, 12.81*1.53≈19.61 after 6 multiplications. But wait, 1.53^6 is approximately 19.61? Wait, that can't be right because 1.53^2≈2.34, ^3≈3.58, ^4≈5.47, ^5≈8.37, ^6≈12.81, ^7≈19.61. So 1.53^7≈19.61.

Wait, so 1.53^6.536 is between 1.53^6 (≈12.81) and 1.53^7 (≈19.61). Let me compute 1.53^6.536 more accurately.

Alternatively, take natural logs. Let me compute ln(1.53^(1/0.153))= (1/0.153)*ln(1.53)=6.5358 *0.424≈6.5358*0.424≈2.769

So exponentiate: e^2.769≈15.88

Which is close to y≈16.34. So that's a bit off, but considering the approximation, it's in the ballpark.

So with b≈0.153, x≈1.53, y≈16.34.

Then, the product xy≈1.53*16.34≈25. So is the answer 25?

Wait, let me check it more accurately.

Wait, let's compute x and y precisely with b≈0.153.

x=10b≈1.53

y=5/(2b)=5/(0.306)≈16.34

Then, xy≈1.53 *16.34≈1.53*16=24.48, 1.53*0.34≈0.520, total≈24.48+0.52≈25 exactly.

So, xy≈25.

Let me check with exact values.

If xy=25, then maybe x=5 and y=5?

Wait, because 5*5=25.

Wait, let me see. If x=5 and y=5, then:

First equation: log_5(5^5)=log_5(3125)=5. But the equation says it's equal to 10. So that doesn't satisfy the first equation. So 5 and 5 are out.

Wait, but maybe x and y are 10 and 2.5? Because 10*2.5=25.

Wait, let me check:

x=10, y=2.5.

First equation: log_10( (2.5)^10 )

Wait, (2.5)^10 is a big number, but log_10 of that would be 10*log_10(2.5)≈10*0.39794≈3.9794≈4, not 10. So that doesn't satisfy.

Hmm, so perhaps the actual product is 25.

Wait, but in our approximate solution, x≈1.53 and y≈16.34, their product is 25. So maybe 25 is the answer.

Alternatively, is there a way to find exact values?

Wait, if I consider that xy=25, then y=25/x.

Let me see if that can be substituted into the original equations.

From the first equation: log_x(y^x)=10 → log_x(y^x)=x log_x(y)=10

But y=25/x, so log_x(25/x)= log_x(25) - log_x(x)= log_x(25) -1

So equation 1 becomes:

x*(log_x(25) -1)=10

Similarly, the second equation: log_y(x^{4y})=4y log_y(x)=10

Since y=25/x, log_y(x)= log_{25/x}(x)= 1 / log_x(25/x)= 1/(log_x(25)-log_x(x))=1/(log_x(25)-1)

So equation 2:4y*(1/(log_x(25)-1))=10

But y=25/x, so:

4*(25/x) * [1/(log_x(25)-1)] =10

Which is:

(100/x) / (log_x(25)-1) =10 →(100/x) =10*(log_x(25)-1) →10/x= log_x(25) -1

So, from equation 1:

x*(log_x(25) -1)=10

But 10/x = log_x(25) -1. Let me substitute:

x*(10/x)=10 →10=10.

So that's an identity. Which means that as long as xy=25, the equations are satisfied.

Therefore, the product xy must be 25.

Wow, that's clever. So, by assuming that xy=25, the equations hold, meaning that regardless of the specific values of x and y (as long as they satisfy the initial conditions), their product is 25.

So the answer is 25.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To solve the problem, we start with the given equations:

\[
\log_x(y^x) = 10 \quad \text{and} \quad \log_y(x^{4y}) = 10
\]

Using logarithm properties, we can rewrite these as:

\[
x \cdot \log_x(y) = 10 \quad \text{and} \quad 4y \cdot \log_y(x) = 10
\]

Let \( a = \log_x(y) \). Then, \( \log_y(x) = \frac{1}{a} \). Substituting into the equations, we get:

\[
x \cdot a = 10 \quad \Rightarrow \quad x = \frac{10}{a}
\]
\[
4y \cdot \frac{1}{a} = 10 \quad \Rightarrow \quad y = \frac{5a}{2}
\]

Since \( a = \log_x(y) \), by definition \( y = x^a \). Substituting \( x = \frac{10}{a} \), we have:

\[
y = \left( \frac{10}{a} \right)^a
\]

But from earlier, \( y = \frac{5a}{2} \). Equating the two expressions for \( y \):

\[
\left( \frac{10}{a} \right)^a = \frac{5a}{2}
\]

Taking natural logarithms of both sides and simplifying leads to a complex equation. However, by assuming \( xy = 25 \), we can verify that this satisfies both original equations. Substituting \( y = \frac{25}{x} \) into the equations confirms that they hold true.

Thus, the product \( xy \) is:

\[
\boxed{25}
\]
