Okay, so I've got this problem here. It says, let ω ≠ 1 be a 13th root of unity. I need to find the remainder when the product from k=0 to 12 of (2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k}) is divided by 1000. Hmm, that's a bit of a mouthful, but let's break it down.

First off, ω is a primitive 13th root of unity, right? Because it's a 13th root and not equal to 1. So, that means ω^13 = 1, and ω^k for k from 0 to 12 gives all the distinct 13th roots of unity.

The expression I need to compute is the product over k from 0 to 12 of (2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k}). Let me write that down:

Product = ∏_{k=0}^{12} (2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k})

Hmm, I remember that products involving roots of unity can sometimes be evaluated using properties of cyclotomic polynomials or by recognizing patterns in the factors. Let me think about how to approach this.

Looking at each term in the product: 2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k}. Maybe I can factor this or rewrite it in a more manageable form. Let's try to manipulate the expression inside the product.

Let me denote z = ω^k. Then each term becomes 2 - 2z + z^2. So, for each k, we're looking at z^2 - 2z + 2. Let's compute that quadratic:

z^2 - 2z + 2. Hmm. Maybe factor it? Let's check the discriminant: D = (−2)^2 - 4*1*2 = 4 - 8 = -4. Since the discriminant is negative, the roots are complex, so it doesn't factor nicely over the reals. Maybe over the complex numbers? But I'm not sure that's helpful here.

Alternatively, perhaps I can relate this quadratic to some cyclotomic polynomial. The 13th cyclotomic polynomial is Φ_13(x) = x^{12} + x^{11} + ... + x + 1, right? Because for a prime n, Φ_n(x) = x^{n-1} + x^{n-2} + ... + x + 1.

But I'm not sure how to connect z^2 - 2z + 2 to Φ_{13}(x). Let me think differently.

Wait, another approach might be to consider that for each k, z = ω^k is a root of x^{13} - 1 = 0, but not a root of x - 1 = 0. So, each z satisfies z^{13} = 1.

So, maybe if I can express the product in terms of polynomials evaluated at certain points. Since we're taking the product over all z = ω^k, which are all the 13th roots of unity except z = 1 (but wait, when k=0, ω^0 = 1, so actually, we do include z=1 as well). So, the product is over all 13th roots of unity.

Wait, so the product is ∏_{z^{13}=1} (z^2 - 2z + 2). Because each k from 0 to 12 gives a distinct 13th root of unity, so the product is over all z with z^13=1 of (z^2 - 2z + 2).

That's a key insight. So, the product is the product of (z^2 - 2z + 2) for all z such that z^13 = 1.

But how does that help? Well, in complex analysis, the product over all roots of unity of a polynomial can sometimes be related to evaluating that polynomial at specific points or using properties of cyclotomic polynomials.

I remember that if you have a polynomial P(x) and you take the product of P(z) for all roots z of another polynomial Q(x), then that product can sometimes be expressed in terms of resultant or something similar. But I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact method.

Wait, here's a thought. The product over all 13th roots of unity of (z^2 - 2z + 2) is the same as evaluating the resultant of the polynomials x^{13} - 1 and z^2 - 2z + 2. Or, more precisely, it's the product of (z^2 - 2z + 2) for each root z of x^{13} - 1 = 0.

Alternatively, perhaps we can think of this as resultant(x^{13} - 1, z^2 - 2z + 2, z). Wait, not sure about that.

Alternatively, perhaps we can think of it as the value of the polynomial P(x) = x^{13} - 1 evaluated at the roots of another polynomial. Hmm, maybe not.

Wait, another approach: consider that if f(z) = z^2 - 2z + 2, then the product over all z^{13}=1 of f(z) is equal to the product of f(z) for each z. Since f(z) is a quadratic, and z runs over all 13th roots of unity, perhaps we can express this product as the product over k=0 to 12 of f(ω^k).

So, what is f(ω^k)? It's (ω^{2k} - 2ω^k + 2). Wait, no, that's what the original term was. So, the product is the same as our original expression. Hmm, maybe this approach isn't helpful.

Alternatively, perhaps note that the product over all z^{13} = 1 of (z^2 - 2z + 2) can be thought of as the resultant of f(z) and z^{13} - 1, but I might be getting into too abstract a territory here.

Wait, another idea: Since we're dealing with polynomials, perhaps we can use logarithms? Taking the logarithm of the product turns it into a sum of logarithms, but I don't think that's helpful here.

Wait, here's a better idea: The product over all 13th roots of unity of (z^2 - 2z + 2) is equal to the product over all z with z^{13}=1 of (z^2 - 2z + 2). Let's consider that the product over all roots of unity of a function can sometimes be found by evaluating the function at certain other roots or by using properties of exponents.

Wait, perhaps we can write the product as the product from z^{13}=1 of (z^2 - 2z + 2). Let me write this as Product = ∏_{z^{13}=1} (z^2 - 2z + 2).

But how can we compute this? Well, perhaps we can consider that for any polynomial f(z), the product over all roots of unity of f(z) is equal to the resultant of f(z) and z^n - 1, where n is the order of the roots. But I'm not exactly sure about the formula.

Wait, I recall that the product over all n-th roots of unity of (z - a) is equal to z^n - 1. But in our case, the factor is (z^2 - 2z + 2), which is a quadratic, not linear. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps we can consider that the product over all z^{13}=1 of (z^2 - 2z + 2) is equal to the resultant of the polynomials z^2 - 2z + 2 and z^{13} - 1. The resultant of two polynomials is the product of f evaluated at the roots of g, which in this case would be exactly our product.

So, the resultant Res(z^2 - 2z + 2, z^{13} - 1) is equal to the product over all roots z of z^{13} -1 of (z^2 - 2z + 2), which is exactly the product we're looking for.

But how do we compute this resultant? I remember that the resultant of two polynomials f and g can be computed using their Sylvester matrix, but that might be cumbersome here.

Alternatively, we can note that the resultant Res(f, g) is equal to the product of f(z) for each root z of g, which is exactly what we have here. So, our product is the resultant of z^2 - 2z + 2 and z^{13} - 1.

But I think there's a formula for the resultant of two polynomials. Alternatively, perhaps using properties of exponents or multiplicativity.

Wait, another approach: Let me note that if f(z) = z^2 - 2z + 2, then we can write f(z) as (z - 1)^2 + 1. That is, f(z) = (z -1)^2 +1 = z^2 - 2z + 2. So, perhaps that form is helpful.

Alternatively, perhaps we can factor f(z) as (z - a)(z - b), but since the roots are complex, maybe that's not directly helpful.

Wait, perhaps if we consider the fact that the product over all z^{13}=1 of (z^2 - 2z + 2) is equal to the product over z^{13}=1 of (z^2 - 2z + 2). Let me denote this product as P.

We can note that P is equal to the product of (z^2 - 2z + 2) as z ranges over all 13th roots of unity.

But perhaps we can write this product as the product over z^{13}=1 of (z^2 - 2z + 2). Let me think about the relation between z and ω.

Wait, perhaps if we let z = ω^k, then each term becomes (ω^{2k} - 2ω^k + 2), which is exactly the term in our original product. So, in that case, the product is the same as the product over k=0 to 12 of (2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k}), which is the same as ∏_{k=0}^{12} (2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k}).

So, P = ∏_{k=0}^{12} (2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k}).

Hmm, but I'm going in circles here.

Wait, perhaps another idea: Since each term is 2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k}, maybe we can write this as 2(1 - ω^k) + ω^{2k}, but not sure if that helps.

Alternatively, maybe factor 2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k} as a quadratic in ω^k.

Let me try that. Let me let x = ω^k, so the term is 2 - 2x + x^2. Let me rearrange that: x^2 - 2x + 2.

Hmm, as before. So, perhaps I can write x^2 - 2x + 2 = (x - a)(x - b), but since the roots are complex, a and b would be 1 + i and 1 - i, since the quadratic equation gives x = [2 ± sqrt(4 - 8)] / 2 = [2 ± sqrt(-4)] /2 = 1 ± i.

So, x^2 - 2x + 2 = (x - (1+i))(x - (1-i)).

Thus, each term in the product is (x - (1+i))(x - (1-i)), where x = ω^k.

Therefore, the entire product is the product over k=0 to 12 of (ω^k - (1+i))(ω^k - (1-i)).

Which can be written as [∏_{k=0}^{12} (ω^k - (1+i))] × [∏_{k=0}^{12} (ω^k - (1-i))].

So, P = [∏_{k=0}^{12} (ω^k - (1+i))] × [∏_{k=0}^{12} (ω^k - (1-i))].

Now, perhaps I can compute each of these two products separately.

I remember that for a polynomial f(x) = x^n - 1, the product of (x - ω^k) for k=0 to n-1 is f(x). So, in our case, since ω is a primitive 13th root of unity, the product over k=0 to 12 of (x - ω^k) = x^{13} - 1.

Therefore, if we set x = (1+i), then the product ∏_{k=0}^{12} ( (1 + i) - ω^k ) = (1 + i)^{13} - 1.

Similarly, ∏_{k=0}^{12} ( (1 - i) - ω^k ) = (1 - i)^{13} - 1.

So, putting this together, P = [ (1 + i)^{13} - 1 ] × [ (1 - i)^{13} - 1 ].

Therefore, our product is equal to [ (1 + i)^{13} - 1 ][ (1 - i)^{13} - 1 ].

This seems manageable because we can compute (1 + i)^13 and (1 - i)^13.

So, let's compute (1 + i)^13 first.

We know that 1 + i can be represented in polar form. Let's compute its modulus and argument.

The modulus of 1 + i is sqrt(1^2 + 1^2) = sqrt(2).

The argument is arctan(1/1) = π/4 radians.

So, 1 + i = sqrt(2) * (cos(π/4) + i sin(π/4)).

Therefore, (1 + i)^13 = [sqrt(2)]^13 * [cos(13π/4) + i sin(13π/4)].

Similarly for (1 - i):

Modulus is sqrt(2), same as above.

Argument is -π/4.

So, (1 - i)^13 = [sqrt(2)]^13 * [cos(-13π/4) + i sin(-13π/4)].

But cos is even and sin is odd, so cos(-13π/4) = cos(13π/4), and sin(-13π/4) = -sin(13π/4).

Let me compute [sqrt(2)]^13.

sqrt(2) is 2^{1/2}, so [2^{1/2}]^13 = 2^{13/2} = 2^6 * 2^{1/2} = 64 * sqrt(2).

So, (1 + i)^13 = 64 * sqrt(2) [cos(13π/4) + i sin(13π/4)].

Similarly, (1 - i)^13 = 64 * sqrt(2) [cos(13π/4) - i sin(13π/4)].

Now, let's compute 13π/4.

13π/4 is equal to 3π + π/4, which is the same as π/4 beyond 3π, which is in the third quadrant.

But let's compute it modulo 2π to find the equivalent angle.

13π/4 divided by 2π is (13/4) / 2 = 13/8, which is 1 and 5/8, so subtract 2π once: 13π/4 - 2π = 13π/4 - 8π/4 = 5π/4.

So, 13π/4 is coterminal with 5π/4.

So, cos(5π/4) = -sqrt(2)/2, and sin(5π/4) = -sqrt(2)/2.

So, cos(13π/4) = cos(5π/4) = -sqrt(2)/2.

Similarly, sin(13π/4) = sin(5π/4) = -sqrt(2)/2.

Therefore, (1 + i)^13 = 64 * sqrt(2) [ -sqrt(2)/2 - i sqrt(2)/2 ].

Let me compute this:

First, sqrt(2) * sqrt(2)/2 = 2/2 = 1. So,

64 * sqrt(2) * (-sqrt(2)/2) = 64 * (-2/2) = 64 * (-1) = -64.

Similarly, for the imaginary part:

64 * sqrt(2) * (-i sqrt(2)/2) = 64 * (-2/2) i = -64i.

So, (1 + i)^13 = -64 - 64i.

Similarly, (1 - i)^13:

64 * sqrt(2) [cos(13π/4) - i sin(13π/4)].

Which is 64 * sqrt(2) [ (-sqrt(2)/2) - i (-sqrt(2)/2) ].

Simplify:

64 * sqrt(2) * (-sqrt(2)/2) = -64.

64 * sqrt(2) * (sqrt(2)/2) i = +64i.

So, (1 - i)^13 = -64 + 64i.

Therefore, our two terms are:

(1 + i)^13 - 1 = (-64 - 64i) - 1 = -65 - 64i.

(1 - i)^13 - 1 = (-64 + 64i) - 1 = -65 + 64i.

So, P = (-65 - 64i)(-65 + 64i).

This is a product of a complex number and its conjugate, so it's equal to the square of the modulus.

Compute modulus squared: (-65)^2 + (64)^2.

Which is 4225 + 4096 = 8321.

Wait, let me compute that:

65^2 = (60 +5)^2 = 60^2 + 2*60*5 +5^2 = 3600 + 600 +25 = 4225.

64^2 = 4096.

So, 4225 + 4096 = 8321.

So, P = 8321.

Therefore, the product is 8321.

But wait, the problem says to find the remainder when this product is divided by 1000. So, 8321 divided by 1000. The remainder is 321.

Wait, but let me confirm.

Compute 8321 mod 1000: 8321 / 1000 = 8 * 1000 = 8000, remainder 321.

So, 8321 - 8*1000 = 321.

Therefore, the remainder is 321.

Wait, but let me double-check my calculations, especially when computing (1 + i)^13 and (1 - i)^13.

Wait, I think I might have made a mistake in calculating the angle. Let me re-examine that step.

Wait, 13π/4 is indeed 3π + π/4, which is π/4 beyond 3π, which is the same as 5π/4 when considering modulo 2π.

So, cos(5π/4) is -sqrt(2)/2, and sin(5π/4) is -sqrt(2)/2. That seems correct.

Then, (1 + i)^13 = 64*sqrt(2) [cos(5π/4) + i sin(5π/4)].

Which is 64*sqrt(2) [ -sqrt(2)/2 + i (-sqrt(2)/2) ].

So, 64*sqrt(2) * (-sqrt(2)/2) = 64*(-1) because sqrt(2)*sqrt(2) is 2, 2/2=1. So, 64*(-1) = -64.

Similarly, the imaginary part: 64*sqrt(2) * (-sqrt(2)/2) i = 64*(-1) i = -64i.

So, (1 + i)^13 is -64 -64i. Correct.

Similarly, (1 - i)^13 = 64*sqrt(2) [cos(5π/4) - i sin(5π/4)].

Which is 64*sqrt(2)[ -sqrt(2)/2 - i*(-sqrt(2)/2) ].

So, the real part: 64*sqrt(2)*(-sqrt(2)/2) = -64.

The imaginary part: 64*sqrt(2)*(sqrt(2)/2) i = +64i.

So, (1 - i)^13 is -64 +64i. Correct.

Then, (1 + i)^13 - 1 = (-64 -64i) -1 = -65 -64i.

Similarly, (1 - i)^13 -1 = (-64 +64i) -1 = -65 +64i.

Multiplying these two: (-65 -64i)(-65 +64i).

Which is (-65)^2 - (64i)^2.

Wait, no, that's not the expansion. Wait, (a - b)(a + b) = a^2 - b^2.

So, here, a = -65, b = 64i.

So, [(-65)^2 - (64i)^2] = [4225 - (4096)(i^2)].

Since i^2 = -1, so:

4225 - 4096*(-1) = 4225 + 4096 = 8321.

Yes, that's correct. So, the product is indeed 8321.

Thus, 8321 divided by 1000 is 8 with a remainder of 321.

So, the remainder is 321.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To solve the problem, we start by recognizing that ω is a primitive 13th root of unity, meaning ω^13 = 1 and ω^k for k = 0, 1, ..., 12 are all distinct 13th roots of unity. The given product is:

\[
\prod_{k=0}^{12} (2 - 2\omega^k + \omega^{2k})
\]

We rewrite each term as a quadratic in z = ω^k:

\[
2 - 2z + z^2 = z^2 - 2z + 2
\]

This quadratic can be factored as:

\[
z^2 - 2z + 2 = (z - (1 + i))(z - (1 - i))
\]

Thus, the product becomes:

\[
\prod_{k=0}^{12} (2 - 2\omega^k + \omega^{2k}) = \prod_{k=0}^{12} (1 + i - \omega^k) \cdot \prod_{k=0}^{12} (1 - i - \omega^k)
\]

Recognizing that the product of (x - ω^k) for all 13th roots of unity ω^k is x^{13} - 1, we set x = 1 + i and x = 1 - i:

\[
\prod_{k=0}^{12} (1 + i - \omega^k) = (1 + i)^{13} - 1
\]
\[
\prod_{k=0}^{12} (1 - i - \omega^k) = (1 - i)^{13} - 1
\]

Next, we compute (1 + i)^{13} and (1 - i)^{13}. Expressing 1 + i and 1 - i in polar form:

\[
1 + i = \sqrt{2} \left( \cos\frac{\pi}{4} + i\sin\frac{\pi}{4} \right)
\]
\[
1 - i = \sqrt{2} \left( \cos\frac{\pi}{4} - i\sin\frac{\pi}{4} \right)
\]

Raising to the 13th power:

\[
(1 + i)^{13} = (\sqrt{2})^{13} \left( \cos\frac{13\pi}{4} + i\sin\frac{13\pi}{4} \right) = 64\sqrt{2} \left( -\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} - i\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \right) = -64 - 64i
\]
\[
(1 - i)^{13} = (\sqrt{2})^{13} \left( \cos\frac{13\pi}{4} - i\sin\frac{13\pi}{4} \right) = 64\sqrt{2} \left( -\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} + i\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \right) = -64 + 64i
\]

Subtracting 1 from each:

\[
(1 + i)^{13} - 1 = -65 - 64i
\]
\[
(1 - i)^{13} - 1 = -65 + 64i
\]

The product is:

\[
(-65 - 64i)(-65 + 64i) = (-65)^2 - (64i)^2 = 4225 + 4096 = 8321
\]

Finally, finding the remainder when 8321 is divided by 1000:

\[
8321 \mod 1000 = 321
\]

The remainder is:

\boxed{321}
