Okay, so I've got this problem about residents in Aimeville and the things they own. Let me try to break it down step by step. I'm a bit rusty on set theory, but I remember something about inclusion-exclusion principles. Let's see if I can apply that here.

Alright, the problem states there are 900 residents. Each of them owns at least one thing, but actually, it says each owns a bag of candy hearts. Wait, so candy hearts are universal—everyone has that. So, the four things we're considering are diamond rings, golf clubs, garden spades, and candy hearts. But candy hearts are owned by everyone, so maybe that's like a given. Or wait, perhaps I should consider all four items as the universal set? Hmm, the problem says each resident owns a bag of candy hearts, so maybe that's a separate thing, not part of the other three. Let me read the problem again.

It says: 195 own a diamond ring, 367 own a set of golf clubs, and 562 own a garden spade. Also, each of the 900 owns a bag of candy hearts. So candy hearts are a fourth item that everyone has. Interesting. So we're dealing with four items, but candy hearts are universal. Then, we're told that 437 residents own exactly two of these things, and 234 own exactly three. We need to find how many own all four.

Wait, but candy hearts are part of the four, right? So when they say "exactly two," does that include candy hearts? Or are they considering the other three? Hmm, the problem statement is a bit ambiguous. Let me read it again.

It says, "there are 437 residents who own exactly two of these things, and 234 residents who own exactly three of these things." The "these things" probably refer to the things mentioned earlier, which are diamond rings, golf clubs, garden spades, and candy hearts. So yes, they're part of the four. So when it says exactly two, that includes candy hearts as one of the two. Same with exactly three.

Okay, so let's define the sets:

- Let D be the set of residents owning diamond rings.
- G be those owning golf clubs.
- S be those owning garden spades.
- C be those owning candy hearts. Since everyone owns C, C is the universal set, so |C|=900.

The problem gives |D|=195, |G|=367, |S|=562, |C|=900.

We also know that 437 own exactly two of these four things, and 234 own exactly three. We're to find those who own all four, which is |D ∩ G ∩ S ∩ C|.

Wait, but since C is everyone, this is the same as |D ∩ G ∩ S|.

So, we can model this using the inclusion-exclusion principle for four sets. But since C is universal, some terms might simplify. Let me recall the inclusion-exclusion formula for four sets.

The formula for the union of four sets is:

|D ∪ G ∪ S ∪ C| = |D| + |G| + |S| + |C| - |D∩G| - |D∩S| - |D∩C| - |G∩S| - |G∩C| - |S∩C| + |D∩G∩S| + |D∩G∩C| + |D∩S∩C| + |G∩S∩C| - |D∩G∩S∩C|

But wait, since C is the universal set, C includes all other sets. So, for example, D ∩ C is just D, because everyone in D is also in C. Similarly, G ∩ C is G, and S ∩ C is S.

Same with intersections involving C. So, for instance, D ∩ G ∩ C is just D ∩ G, because all of D ∩ G are already in C. Similarly, every intersection with C is redundant because C is universal.

So, the formula simplifies a lot because any intersection with C can be considered as just the intersection of the other sets.

So, let me rewrite the formula considering that:

|D ∪ G ∪ S ∪ C| = |D| + |G| + |S| + |C| - (|D∩G| + |D∩S| + |G∩S|) - (|D∩G∩S| + |D∩G∩C| + |D∩S∩C| + |G∩S∩C|) ) + |D∩G∩S∩C|

Wait, no, that might not be the right approach. Maybe it's better to think of C as the container for all, so the union is just C, which is 900. So, |D ∪ G ∪ S ∪ C| = 900, because everyone is in C.

So, applying that:

900 = |D| + |G| + |S| + |C| - (|D∩G| + |D∩S| + |G∩S| + |D∩C| + |G∩C| + |S∩C| ) + (|D∩G∩S| + |D∩G∩C| + |D∩S∩C| + |G∩S∩C|) - |D∩G∩S∩C|

But since C is everything, D∩C = D, G∩C = G, S∩C = S, so |D∩C|=195, |G∩C|=367, |S∩C|=562.

Similarly, any three-way intersection with C is just the three-way without C. For example, D∩G∩C is D∩G, because C includes all. Similarly, D∩G∩S∩C is D∩G∩S.

So, substituting these into the formula:

900 = |D| + |G| + |S| + |C| - (|D∩G| + |D∩S| + |G∩S| + |D| + |G| + |S| ) + (|D∩G∩S| + |D∩G| + |D∩S| + |G∩S| ) - |D∩G∩S|

Wait, maybe I'm complicating this. Let me try another approach.

Alternatively, since C is the universal set, the problem reduces to three sets: D, G, S. Because anyone outside of D, G, or S is in C but not in any of the other three. But since C is everyone, the only people who don't own D, G, or S are those who only own C. So the total number of residents is 900, which equals the number of people owning at least one of D, G, S, plus the number who only own C.

Wait, but the problem says each resident owns a bag of candy hearts. So, the four things are D, G, S, and C. So, the residents can own any combination of these, including only C.

But the problem says that 437 own exactly two of these four things, and 234 own exactly three. So, this includes C as one of the possible items in the count.

Wait, but maybe it's better to model this as four sets, with C being universal.

Hmm, perhaps it's easier to think in terms of the inclusion-exclusion principle for four sets, but considering that C is the universal set, so any intersection involving C is redundant.

Let me try to approach this by considering that since everyone has C, the problem is about the other three items. So, the number of people owning at least one of D, G, or S is equal to the number of people who own at least one of these, which would be equal to the number of people not owning only C.

But the problem gives us that 437 own exactly two things, and 234 own exactly three. So, these counts include C as one of the two or three. So, for example, someone who owns exactly two things could be someone who owns C and D, but nothing else. Similarly, someone who owns exactly three could be someone who owns C, D, and G, but not S.

Hmm, this is getting a bit complicated. Let me think about how the inclusion-exclusion works when C is universal.

Alternatively, maybe I can model the problem as four sets, with C being the universal set. So, each of the other sets (D, G, S) is a subset of C.

In such a case, the formula for the union of D, G, S, and C is just C, since C includes everyone. So, |D ∪ G ∪ S ∪ C| = |C| =900.

But then, the inclusion-exclusion formula for four sets would be:

|D ∪ G ∪ S ∪ C| = |D| + |G| + |S| + |C| - |D∩G| - |D∩S| - |D∩C| - |G∩S| - |G∩C| - |S∩C| + |D∩G∩S| + |D∩G∩C| + |D∩S∩C| + |G∩S∩C| - |D∩G∩S∩C|

But since C is the universal set, any intersection with C is just the other set. For example, D∩C = D, so |D∩C|=|D|=195. Similarly, G∩C = G, so |G∩C|=367, and S∩C = S, so |S∩C|=562.

Similarly, intersections like D∩G∩C = D∩G, because C is universal. So, |D∩G∩C|=|D∩G|.

Same with D∩G∩S∩C = D∩G∩S, so |D∩G∩S∩C|=|D∩G∩S|.

So, substituting these into the formula:

900 = |D| + |G| + |S| + |C| - |D∩G| - |D∩S| - |D| - |G∩S| - |G| - |S| + |D∩G∩S| + |D∩G| + |D∩S| + |G∩S| - |D∩G∩S|

Let me plug in the numbers:

|D|=195, |G|=367, |S|=562, |C|=900.

So,

900 = 195 + 367 + 562 + 900 - |D∩G| - |D∩S| - 195 - |G∩S| - 367 - 562 + |D∩G∩S| + |D∩G| + |D∩S| + |G∩S| - |D∩G∩S|

Let me compute the left side: 900.

Right side:

Compute each term:

First, the positive terms: 195 + 367 + 562 + 900.

195 + 367 = 562; 562 + 562 = 1124; 1124 + 900 = 2024.

Now the negative terms: -|D∩G| - |D∩S| - |D| - |G∩S| - |G| - |S|

Which is: -|D∩G| - |D∩S| -195 -|G∩S| -367 -562.

Adding the constants: 195 + 367 + 562 = 195+367=562; 562+562=1124.

So negative terms: -( |D∩G| + |D∩S| + |G∩S| ) - 1124.

Now the positive terms: + |D∩G∩S| + |D∩G| + |D∩S| + |G∩S|.

Which is: |D∩G∩S| + (|D∩G| + |D∩S| + |G∩S| ).

Lastly, minus |D∩G∩S|.

So putting it all together:

900 = 2024 - (|D∩G| + |D∩S| + |G∩S| ) -1124 + |D∩G∩S| + (|D∩G| + |D∩S| + |G∩S| ) - |D∩G∩S|

Looking at this, let's see if some terms cancel out.

The term (|D∩G| + |D∩S| + |G∩S|) appears with a negative sign and then a positive sign, so they cancel each other out.

Similarly, |D∩G∩S| is added and then subtracted, so they cancel.

So, the equation simplifies to:

900 = 2024 - 1124

Compute 2024 - 1124: 2024 - 1000=1024; 1024-124= 900.

So, 900 = 900.

Hmm, that's a tautology. So, this approach doesn't help me find anything, because it's just confirming that the equation holds, but it's not giving me the values of the intersections.

So, perhaps I need a different approach.

Wait, the problem gives me that 437 people own exactly two of the four things, and 234 own exactly three. Since C is universal, owning exactly two things could involve C, and exactly three could also involve C.

Wait, but how exactly? Let me think. So, for example, someone who owns exactly two things could own C and D, but nothing else. Similarly, someone who owns exactly three could own C, D, and G, but nothing else.

So, the total number of people owning exactly two things is 437. These are the number of people owning exactly two of the four items, including C. Similarly, 234 own exactly three, including C.

Now, let me think about the inclusion-exclusion formula in terms of the number of elements in exactly one set, exactly two sets, etc.

In set theory, the inclusion-exclusion formula can be broken down into the number of elements in exactly k sets. Let me recall that.

The formula:

|A ∪ B ∪ C| = |A| + |B| + |C| - |A ∩ B| - |A ∩ C| - |B ∩ C| + |A ∩ B ∩ C|

But in our case, C is the universal set, so perhaps it's better to model it differently.

Alternatively, considering that the four sets include the universal set, but perhaps it's better to think in terms of the other three sets (D, G, S) and how they overlap, with C being present in everyone.

Wait, maybe I can model the problem as the three sets D, G, S, and note that each of them is a subset of C. So, the total number of people owning at least one of D, G, S is equal to the number of people not owning only C.

But the problem gives us the number of people owning exactly two things and exactly three things, which includes C.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to model the problem using the principle that the sum of the sizes of all subsets can be expressed in terms of the exact counts.

Wait, another approach: the total number of residents is 900. Each resident owns at least one of the four items (since C is universal). The number of people owning exactly two items is 437, and exactly three is 234. Let me denote the number of people owning all four items as x, which is what we're trying to find.

Wait, but since C is universal, owning all four is the same as owning D, G, S, and C. But since C is always there, it's the same as owning D, G, and S. So, x is the number of people owning D, G, S, and C, which is |D ∩ G ∩ S|.

So, now, considering that, let's use the formula for the union of D, G, S, and C.

The total number of residents is equal to the number of people owning at least one of D, G, S, or C. But since everyone owns C, this is the same as the number of people owning at least one of D, G, S, which is the same as the entire population, 900. Wait, no, because some people might own only C and nothing else. Oh, wait, no, because the problem states that each resident owns a bag of candy hearts. So, C is universal, so the union of D, G, S, and C is C, so the total is 900.

Wait, but the problem is giving us the exact counts of people owning exactly two and exactly three items. So, perhaps I can model the problem using the standard inclusion-exclusion principle for four sets, but with the knowledge that C is universal.

Wait, perhaps it's better to model the problem as four sets, but since C is universal, the formula simplifies.

Wait, another approach: the number of people owning exactly k of the four items (including C) can be expressed in terms of the inclusion-exclusion formula.

Let me denote:

a = number of people owning exactly one item (but since C is universal, this would be those owning only C, because owning any other single item would imply they also own C, but perhaps they own more? Wait, no, because the "exactly one" would include only C, since if someone owns only D, they also own C, but the problem counts the number of people who own exactly two items, which would include C and D, but not others. Hmm, maybe this is getting too complicated.)

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to think in terms of the principle that the sum of all the exact counts equals the total population.

So, the total population is the sum of people owning exactly one item, exactly two, exactly three, and exactly four items.

But the problem gives us that 437 own exactly two, and 234 own exactly three. We don't know the number of people owning exactly one or exactly four.

Wait, but since C is universal, any person who owns exactly one item must be owning only C, because if they own D, they also own C, so they can't own exactly one item. Similarly for G and S. So, the only people who own exactly one item are those who own only C.

Similarly, the number of people owning exactly two items would be those who own C and one other item, but not the others. Similarly, exactly three would be those owning C and two others, but not the third, and exactly four would be those owning all four, which is the same as owning D, G, S, and C.

So, let's denote:

- Let x be the number of people owning all four items (so, D, G, S, and C).

- Let y be the number of people owning exactly three items, which would be those owning C plus two others. So, for example, C, D, G but not S, etc. But the problem says exactly three, so it's 234 people.

Wait, but wait, the problem says 234 own exactly three of these things, which includes C. So, these 234 people are the ones owning exactly three items, which could be any three of the four, including C.

Similarly, the 437 own exactly two, which could include C.

So, the problem is that I need to find x, the number of people owning all four, but I don't know the number of people owning exactly one or exactly two, but the problem gives me the counts for exactly two and exactly three.

Wait, perhaps I should use the inclusion-exclusion formula for four sets, but considering the exact counts.

Alternatively, I can set up equations based on the exact counts.

Let me denote:

n1 = number of people owning exactly one item (only C)
n2 = number of people owning exactly two items (including any two of the four, with C)
n3 = number of people owning exactly three items (including C and two others)
n4 = number of people owning all four items (D, G, S, C) = x.

We know that n2 = 437, n3 = 234.

The total population is n1 + n2 + n3 + n4 = 900.

But we don't know n1. However, since C is universal, the people who own exactly one item are those who own only C, so n1 is the number of people who don't own D, G, or S. So, n1 = total number of people - number of people owning at least one of D, G, S.

Wait, but the number of people owning at least one of D, G, S is equal to the number of people owning at least one of those three, which is the union of D, G, S. Let me denote this as |D ∪ G ∪ S|.

But |D ∪ G ∪ S| = |D| + |G| + |S| - |D∩G| - |D∩S| - |G∩S| + |D∩G∩S|.

Wait, but we don't know the pairwise intersections or the triple intersection.

Hmm, maybe another approach. Let's consider that the number of people owning exactly k of the four items is given, and we can relate that to the inclusion-exclusion formula.

The formula for the union of four sets is:

|D ∪ G ∪ S ∪ C| = sum of individual sets - sum of all pairwise intersections + sum of all triple intersections - four-way intersection.

But since C is universal, it's equal to |C|, which is 900. So,

900 = |D| + |G| + |S| + |C| - (|D∩G| + |D∩S| + |D∩C| + |G∩S| + |G∩C| + |S∩C|) + (|D∩G∩S| + |D∩G∩C| + |D∩S∩C| + |G∩S∩C|) - |D∩G∩S∩C|.

But as I thought before, since C is universal, all the intersections with C are just the other sets. So, |D∩C|=|D|=195, |G∩C|=|G|=367, |S∩C|=|S|=562.

Similarly, any triple intersection like |D∩G∩C|=|D∩G|, and |D∩G∩S∩C|=|D∩G∩S|.

So, substituting these into the equation:

900 = |D| + |G| + |S| + |C| - (|D∩G| + |D∩S| + |G∩S| + |D| + |G| + |S| ) + (|D∩G∩S| + |D∩G| + |D∩S| + |G∩S| ) - |D∩G∩S|.

Simplify term by term.

First, the sum of individual sets: |D| + |G| + |S| + |C| = 195 + 367 + 562 + 900 = let's compute that.

195 + 367 = 562; 562 + 562 = 1124; 1124 + 900 = 2024.

Next, subtract the pairwise intersections: (|D∩G| + |D∩S| + |G∩S|) + |D| + |G| + |S|.

Wait, wait, the term is (|D∩G| + |D∩S| + |G∩S| + |D| + |G| + |S| ). So, this is (sum of pairwise intersections) + sum of individual sets.

Sum of individual sets is 195 + 367 + 562 = let's calculate that.

195 + 367 = 562; 562 + 562 = 1124.

So, the term being subtracted is (|D∩G| + |D∩S| + |G∩S| ) + 1124.

Now, the next term is adding (|D∩G∩S| + |D∩G| + |D∩S| + |G∩S| ).

And finally, subtract |D∩G∩S|.

So, putting it all together:

900 = 2024 - (|D∩G| + |D∩S| + |G∩S| + 1124) + (|D∩G∩S| + |D∩G| + |D∩S| + |G∩S| ) - |D∩G∩S|.

Let me distribute the signs:

= 2024 - |D∩G| - |D∩S| - |G∩S| - 1124 + |D∩G∩S| + |D∩G| + |D∩S| + |G∩S| - |D∩G∩S|.

Now, let's see which terms cancel out.

Looking at the terms:

- |D∩G| and + |D∩G| cancel each other.

- |D∩S| and + |D∩S| cancel.

- |G∩S| and + |G∩S| cancel.

Similarly, |D∩G∩S| and - |D∩G∩S| cancel.

So, all that remains is:

900 = 2024 - 1124.

Compute 2024 - 1124: 2024 - 1000 = 1024; 1024 - 124 = 900.

So, 900 = 900. Hmm, that's just a tautology. It doesn't give me any new information.

So, this approach isn't helping. I need another way.

Let me try to think about the exact counts.

We know that 437 people own exactly two of the four items, and 234 own exactly three.

Each of these counts includes C as one of the items. So, for example, someone owning exactly two items could be owning C and D, but nothing else.

Similarly, someone owning exactly three items could be owning C, D, and G, but not S.

Now, the total number of people is the sum of those owning exactly one, exactly two, exactly three, and exactly four items.

But since C is universal, the only people who own exactly one item are those who own only C, so n1 = number of people owning only C.

Similarly, the number of people owning exactly two items is 437, which includes all combinations of two items where one is C, and the other is D, G, or S.

Similarly, the number of people owning exactly three items is 234, which includes combinations where C is included with two of the other three.

And the number of people owning all four items is x, which is what we're trying to find.

So, the total number of people is:

n1 + n2 + n3 + n4 = 900.

Where:

n1 = number of people owning only C.

n2 = 437 (exactly two items, including C).

n3 = 234 (exactly three items, including C).

n4 = x (all four items).

So, n1 = 900 - (n2 + n3 + n4) = 900 - (437 + 234 + x) = 900 - 671 - x = 229 - x.

But n1 must be non-negative, so 229 - x ≥ 0 → x ≤ 229.

Now, I can model this using inclusion-exclusion for the three sets D, G, S, considering that C is universal.

Wait, perhaps I can relate the counts of exactly two and exactly three to the overlaps between D, G, and S.

Let me consider the Venn diagram for three sets D, G, S. The regions represent the number of people owning exactly those combinations.

The formula for the union is:

|D ∪ G ∪ S| = |D| + |G| + |S| - |D∩G| - |D∩S| - |G∩S| + |D∩G∩S|.

But since everyone owns C, the union |D ∪ G ∪ S| represents the number of people owning at least one of D, G, or S, which is equal to 900 - n1, where n1 is the number of people owning only C.

Wait, no, because |D ∪ G ∪ S| would be the number of people owning at least one of D, G, or S. But since everyone owns C, the total number of people is 900, so the number of people owning at least one of D, G, or S is 900 - n1, where n1 is the number owning only C.

But from earlier, n1 = 229 - x.

So, |D ∪ G ∪ S| = 900 - n1 = 900 - (229 - x) = 900 - 229 + x = 671 + x.

Now, the formula for |D ∪ G ∪ S| is:

|D| + |G| + |S| - |D∩G| - |D∩S| - |G∩S| + |D∩G∩S|.

Plugging in the known values:

195 + 367 + 562 - |D∩G| - |D∩S| - |G∩S| + |D∩G∩S| = 671 + x.

Compute the sum: 195 + 367 = 562; 562 + 562 = 1124.

So,

1124 - (|D∩G| + |D∩S| + |G∩S|) + |D∩G∩S| = 671 + x.

Let me rearrange this:

1124 - 671 - x = |D∩G| + |D∩S| + |G∩S| - |D∩G∩S|.

Compute 1124 - 671 = 453.

So,

453 - x = |D∩G| + |D∩S| + |G∩S| - |D∩G∩S|.

Hmm, but I don't know the values of |D∩G|, |D∩S|, |G∩S|, or |D∩G∩S|.

But wait, I can express |D∩G|, |D∩S|, |G∩S| in terms of the number of people owning exactly two items and those owning exactly three and four.

Because |D∩G| includes those who own exactly D and G, exactly D, G, and one other, and exactly all four.

So, |D∩G| = number of people owning exactly D and G (and nothing else) + number owning exactly D, G, and C (and nothing else) + number owning exactly D, G, S, and C.

Similarly for the other pairwise intersections.

Wait, but considering that C is always present, the number of people owning exactly D and G would be the number owning exactly D, G, and C (but not S), which is part of the exactly three items count.

Wait, perhaps a better way is to express the pairwise intersections in terms of the exact counts.

For any two sets, say D and G, the intersection |D∩G| includes:

- The number of people owning exactly D, G, and C (but not S), which is a part of the exactly three items count.

- The number of people owning exactly D, G, S, and C, which is x.

- The number of people owning exactly D and G, but since C is always present, this would be zero because someone owning D and G must also own C, so they can't own exactly D and G without C. Wait, that's not correct because the problem counts exactly two items as those who own two of the four, including C. So, someone owning exactly D and G must also own C, but not S. So, the number of people owning exactly D, G, and C is part of the exactly three items count, but wait, no, exactly three would include C and two others, but exactly two would include C and one other. Wait, no, exactly two would be two of the four, including C. So, for example, someone owning exactly C and D would be in exactly two items, and someone owning C, D, and G would be in exactly three items.

Wait, perhaps it's better to model the intersections as the sum of the exact counts.

For example, the intersection |D∩G| is the number of people owning both D and G, which includes:

- Those who own exactly D, G, and C (but not S) → this is part of the exactly three items count.

- Those who own exactly D, G, S, and C → this is x.

So, |D∩G| = number of exactly three items (D, G, C) + x.

Similarly, |D∩G| is equal to the number of people owning exactly D and G and C, plus those owning all four.

But the problem states that 234 people own exactly three items. How many of these are in each combination?

The exactly three items could be:

- C, D, G

- C, D, S

- C, G, S

- D, G, S (but since C is always present, this would be x.)

Wait, no, because C is always present, so the only exactly three items would be C plus two others. So, the 234 people owning exactly three items are distributed among the three possible combinations: C, D, G; C, D, S; and C, G, S.

Similarly, the exactly two items are:

- C, D

- C, G

- C, S

- D, G

- D, S

- G, S

Wait, no, because if someone owns exactly two items, they could be C and D, C and G, C and S, D and G (but then they must also own C, so that would be three items, which is not allowed), wait, no, if they own D and G, they must also own C, so they can't own exactly two items. Wait, that's a crucial point.

Wait, since C is universal, any person who owns D must own C, and same for G and S. Therefore, a person cannot own exactly D and G without owning C. So, the only way to own exactly two items is to own C plus one of D, G, or S. Because if you own two non-C items, you must also own C, making it three items. So, the exactly two items count (437) must be people who own C and exactly one of D, G, or S.

Wait, that changes things. So, the 437 people owning exactly two items are those who own C plus exactly one of D, G, or S, not owning any others.

Similarly, the 234 people owning exactly three items are those who own C plus exactly two of D, G, S, and not owning the third.

And the x people owning all four items are those who own C, D, G, and S.

So, with this understanding, let me model the problem.

Let me denote:

- Let a be the number of people owning exactly C and D (so, exactly two items: C and D).

- Let b be the number owning exactly C and G.

- Let c be the number owning exactly C and S.

Similarly, let d be the number owning exactly C, D, and G (exactly three items).

- Let e be the number owning exactly C, D, and S.

- Let f be the number owning exactly C, G, and S.

And let x be the number owning all four: C, D, G, S.

So, according to this:

The number of people owning exactly two items is a + b + c = 437.

The number owning exactly three items is d + e + f = 234.

The number owning all four is x.

Now, the total number of people is the sum of those owning exactly one, exactly two, exactly three, and exactly four items.

But since C is universal, the only people owning exactly one item are those owning only C, which we can call n1.

So, n1 + (a + b + c) + (d + e + f) + x = 900.

We know:

a + b + c = 437

d + e + f = 234

So,

n1 + 437 + 234 + x = 900

Thus,

n1 + x = 900 - 437 - 234 = 900 - 671 = 229.

So,

n1 = 229 - x.

Now, let's express the sizes of D, G, S in terms of these variables.

- |D| = number of people owning D. This includes those owning exactly C and D (a), exactly C, D, and G (d), exactly C, D, and S (e), and exactly all four (x).

So,

|D| = a + d + e + x = 195.

Similarly,

|G| = b + d + f + x = 367.

|S| = c + e + f + x = 562.

We have three equations:

1. a + d + e + x = 195

2. b + d + f + x = 367

3. c + e + f + x = 562

We also know:

a + b + c = 437

d + e + f = 234

And,

n1 = 229 - x.

We have six equations with variables a, b, c, d, e, f, x, and n1, but n1 is expressed in terms of x, so we can ignore it for now.

Let me see if I can express d, e, f in terms of the other variables.

But perhaps I can find a relationship between the equations.

Let me sum the three equations:

(a + d + e + x) + (b + d + f + x) + (c + e + f + x) = 195 + 367 + 562.

Calculating the left side:

a + b + c + 2d + 2e + 2f + 3x.

The right side: 195 + 367 = 562; 562 + 562 = 1124.

So,

(a + b + c) + 2(d + e + f) + 3x = 1124.

We know that a + b + c = 437 and d + e + f = 234.

Substituting:

437 + 2*234 + 3x = 1124.

Compute 2*234 = 468.

So,

437 + 468 + 3x = 1124.

437 + 468 = 905.

So,

905 + 3x = 1124.

Subtract 905:

3x = 1124 - 905 = 219.

Thus,

x = 219 / 3 = 73.

So, x is 73.

Therefore, the number of residents owning all four items is 73.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To solve the problem, we use the principle of inclusion-exclusion and analyze the given data. Let's break down the steps:

1. **Define the Sets**:  
   - Let \( D \) be the set of residents owning diamond rings (\( |D| = 195 \)).  
   - Let \( G \) be the set of residents owning golf clubs (\( |G| = 367 \)).  
   - Let \( S \) be the set of residents owning garden spades (\( |S| = 562 \)).  
   - Let \( C \) be the set of residents owning candy hearts (\( |C| = 900 \), universal set).  

2. **Given Data**:  
   - Total residents: \( 900 \).  
   - Residents owning exactly two items: \( 437 \).  
   - Residents owning exactly three items: \( 234 \).  
   - We need to find \( x \), the number of residents owning all four items (\( D \cap G \cap S \cap C \)).  

3. **Exact Ownership Counts**:  
   - Residents owning exactly two items include combinations of \( C \) with one other item.  
   - Residents owning exactly three items include combinations of \( C \) with two other items.  

4. **Set Up Equations**:  
   - Let \( a, b, c \) be the number of residents owning exactly \( C \) and one other item (diamonds, golf, spades).  
   - Let \( d, e, f \) be the number of residents owning exactly \( C \) and two other items.  
   - Let \( x \) be the number of residents owning all four items.  

   From the problem:  
   - \( a + b + c = 437 \) (exactly two items).  
   - \( d + e + f = 234 \) (exactly three items).  

5. **Total Population**:  
   The total number of residents is the sum of all ownership categories:  
   \[
   n_1 + (a + b + c) + (d + e + f) + x = 900
   \]  
   where \( n_1 \) is the number of residents owning only \( C \).  

   Substituting known values:  
   \[
   n_1 + 437 + 234 + x = 900 \implies n_1 + x = 229
   \]

6. **Express Individual Set Sizes**:  
   Each set \( D, G, S \) includes residents owning those items along with \( C \).  
   - \( |D| = a + d + e + x = 195 \)  
   - \( |G| = b + d + f + x = 367 \)  
   - \( |S| = c + e + f + x = 562 \)  

7. **Sum the Equations**:  
   Adding the three equations:  
   \[
   (a + b + c) + 2(d + e + f) + 3x = 195 + 367 + 562 = 1124
   \]  
   Substituting \( a + b + c = 437 \) and \( d + e + f = 234 \):  
   \[
   437 + 2(234) + 3x = 1124 \implies 437 + 468 + 3x = 1124
   \]  
   \[
   905 + 3x = 1124 \implies 3x = 219 \implies x = 73
   \]

**Answer**: The number of residents who own all four items is \( \boxed{73} \).
