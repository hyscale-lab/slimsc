Okay, so I have this problem here where I need to find the radius squared of the smallest sphere that can contain any rectangular box from the set B. The set B consists of boxes with a surface area of 54 and a volume of 23. Then, I have to express this radius squared as a fraction p/q, where p and q are coprime, and find p+q.

Hmm, let me break this down. First, I know that for any rectangular box, the surface area is given by 2(lw + lh + wh) and the volume is lwh, where l, w, h are the length, width, and height. So, for all boxes in B, these equations hold:

2(lw + lh + wh) = 54  
lwh = 23

I think the sphere that can contain the box must have a diameter equal to the space diagonal of the box. The space diagonal d can be found using the formula sqrt(l² + w² + h²). So, the radius r of the sphere would be half of that, which is sqrt(l² + w² + h²)/2. Therefore, r² would be (l² + w² + h²)/4.

So, my goal is to find the minimal possible value of (l² + w² + h²)/4. Wait, no, actually, since all boxes in B have surface area 54 and volume 23, I need to find the maximum space diagonal among all possible boxes in B, because the sphere must contain all such boxes. Hence, the radius must be large enough to contain the box with the largest space diagonal.

Wait, no, actually, the sphere needs to contain every box in B. So, the sphere's radius must be equal to the maximum space diagonal of any box in B divided by 2. So, I need to find the maximum value of sqrt(l² + w² + h²)/2 over all boxes with surface area 54 and volume 23.

Alternatively, to make it simpler, I can focus on maximizing l² + w² + h² given the constraints of surface area and volume.

So, the problem reduces to: maximize l² + w² + h² subject to 2(lw + lh + wh) = 54 and lwh = 23.

Let me think about how to approach this optimization problem. Since there are three variables, maybe I can use Lagrange multipliers or some substitution method.

Alternatively, perhaps I can express l, w, h in terms of symmetric variables. Let me denote x = l, y = w, z = h. So, the surface area equation becomes 2(xy + xz + yz) = 54, which simplifies to xy + xz + yz = 27. And the volume is xyz = 23.

I need to maximize x² + y² + z².

Wait, I remember that for three variables, there's an identity: (x + y + z)² = x² + y² + z² + 2(xy + xz + yz). Since I know xy + xz + yz is 27, I can write x² + y² + z² = (x + y + z)² - 2*27 = (x + y + z)² - 54.

So, if I can maximize x² + y² + z², it's equivalent to maximizing (x + y + z)². Therefore, I need to maximize x + y + z.

So, the problem now becomes: maximize (x + y + z)², given that x, y, z > 0, xy + xz + yz =27, and xyz=23.

Hmm, another approach: perhaps using the method of Lagrange multipliers. Let me set up the function to maximize: f(x, y, z) = x² + y² + z².

Subject to constraints:
1. g(x, y, z) = xy + xz + yz = 27
2. h(x, y, z) = xyz =23

Wait, but Lagrange multipliers with two constraints might be a bit complicated. Maybe I can fix two variables and express the third in terms.

Alternatively, maybe I can use the method of symmetric variables. Let me assume that two variables are equal, say x = y. Maybe the maximum occurs when two variables are equal? Not sure, but let's test that assumption.

Let me set x = y. Then, the volume becomes x² z =23, so z =23/(x²). The surface area equation becomes x² + 2xz =27. Substituting z from volume:

x² + 2x*(23/x²) =27  
x² + 46/x =27  
Multiply both sides by x:  
x³ +46 =27x  
x³ -27x +46=0

Let me try to find real roots of this equation. Maybe rational root theorem. Possible roots are ±1, ±2, ±23, ±46.

Testing x=1: 1 -27 +46=20 ≠0  
x=2:8 -54 +46=0 → x=2 is a root.

So, factor out (x-2): using polynomial division.

Divide x³ -27x +46 by (x-2). Let me do synthetic division:

2 | 1  0  -27  46  
       2   4  -46  
     1  2   -23 0

So, the cubic factors into (x-2)(x² +2x -23)=0.

So, the other roots are from x² +2x -23=0. Using quadratic formula:

x = [-2 ± sqrt(4 +92)]/2 = [-2 ± sqrt(96)]/2 = [-2 ±4*sqrt(6)]/2 = -1 ±2sqrt(6).

Negative roots are discarded since lengths are positive. So, x= -1 +2√6 ≈ -1 +4.898≈3.898.

So, possible x values when x=y=2 or x=y≈3.898.

Wait, let's compute z for each case.

First, x=2, then z=23/(2²)=23/4=5.75. So, the box is 2x2x5.75.

Compute x² + y² + z² = 4 +4 + (23/4)²=8 + (529/16)= (128 +529)/16=657/16≈41.0625.

Second, x≈3.898, z=23/(3.898)^2≈23/(15.198)≈1.514.

Then, x² + y² + z²≈2*(3.898)^2 + (1.514)^2≈2*(15.198) +2.292≈30.396 +2.292≈32.688.

Wait, so when x=y=2, l² + w² + h²≈41.06, which is larger than the other case.

So, perhaps the maximum occurs when two variables are 2 and the third is 5.75.

Wait, but why did we get a smaller value when x=y≈3.898? Maybe because the space diagonal is smaller? But I was trying to maximize x² + y² + z², so the case with x=y=2 gives a larger sum, which is better for our purpose.

But I'm not sure if this is the maximum. Maybe the maximum occurs at another point where variables are not equal. Let me think if there's a way to confirm whether the maximum occurs at x=y=2, z=5.75.

Alternatively, maybe I can use Lagrange multipliers. Let's set up the Lagrangian.

We want to maximize f(x, y, z) = x² + y² + z², subject to g(x, y, z) = xy + xz + yz =27 and h(x, y, z)=xyz=23.

The Lagrangian is L = x² + y² + z² - λ(xy + xz + yz -27) - μ(xyz -23).

Taking partial derivatives:

∂L/∂x = 2x - λ(y + z) - μ yz =0  
∂L/∂y = 2y - λ(x + z) - μ xz =0  
∂L/∂z = 2z - λ(x + y) - μ xy =0  
∂L/∂λ = -(xy + xz + yz -27)=0  
∂L/∂μ = -(xyz -23)=0

Hmm, so we have the system:

1. 2x = λ(y + z) + μ yz  
2. 2y = λ(x + z) + μ xz  
3. 2z = λ(x + y) + μ xy  
4. xy + xz + yz =27  
5. xyz=23

This looks complicated. Maybe I can subtract equations to find relations between variables.

Subtract equation 1 and 2:

2x - 2y = λ(y + z - x - z) + μ(yz - xz)  
Simplify: 2(x - y) = λ(y - x) + μ z(y -x)  
Factor (x - y): 2(x - y) = -(λ + μ z)(x - y)  
Assuming x ≠ y, we can divide both sides by (x - y), getting:

2 = -(λ + μ z)  
Similarly, subtract equation 2 and 3:

2y - 2z = λ(x + z - x - y) + μ(xz - xy)  
Simplify: 2(y - z) = λ(z - y) + μ x(z - y)  
Factor (y - z): 2(y - z) = -(λ + μ x)(y - z)  
Again, assuming y ≠ z, divide both sides:

2 = -(λ + μ x)

So, from both, we get:

-(λ + μ z) = 2  
-(λ + μ x) = 2

Which implies that λ + μ z = λ + μ x → μ z = μ x. Assuming μ ≠0, then z = x.

Wait, so if z = x, then from the first assumption, we had x=y, leading to x=y=z? Or is it x=y=z?

Wait, let me follow.

From the first subtraction, we assumed x ≠ y and found that 2 = -(λ + μ z). The second subtraction, assuming y ≠ z, led to 2= -(λ + μ x). So, if both are true, then μ z = μ x. If μ ≠0, then z = x.

So, if z = x, and from earlier, we assumed x=y, then x=y=z. So, all variables are equal.

Wait, but if x=y=z, then the box is a cube. Let's check what the surface area and volume would be.

If it's a cube, then surface area is 6x² =54 → x²=9→x=3. Volume would be x³=27. But in our problem, the volume is 23, which is less than 27. So, a cube isn't possible here. Therefore, x=y=z is not a solution because volume is 27, but we have volume 23.

Therefore, our assumption that x ≠ y and y ≠ z is incorrect, meaning that perhaps two variables are equal and the third is different, but that might not hold either. Alternatively, all variables are different.

This is getting complicated. Maybe another approach. Let's consider that the maximum of x² + y² + z² occurs when one dimension is as large as possible, and the other two are as small as possible, given the constraints. So, perhaps when one variable is maximized, and the other two are minimized.

But given that the surface area is fixed, making one variable larger would require the other two to be smaller. But how small can they be?

Alternatively, I can consider that for a given surface area, the maximum space diagonal occurs when the box is as "stretched" as possible, i.e., one dimension is as long as possible, and the other two are as short as possible. But with the volume fixed, it's a balance between the two.

Wait, so to maximize the space diagonal, perhaps we need to maximize the sum of squares l² + w² + h² given the constraints. So, given that surface area and volume are fixed, the maximum of l² + w² + h² occurs when the box is as "unequal" as possible, i.e., when one dimension is longer, and the other two are shorter.

Wait, but how can I find the maximum? Maybe I can use the method of Lagrange multipliers again, but perhaps in a reduced form.

Let me assume that two variables are equal, so w = h, for example. Then, the problem reduces to two variables, l and w.

So, surface area: 2(lw + lw + w²) = 54 → 2(2lw + w²) =54 → 4lw + 2w²=54 → 2lw + w²=27.

Volume: l w² =23 → l=23/(w²).

Substituting into surface area equation:

2*(23/(w²)) * w + w² =27  
(46/w) + w² =27  
Multiply both sides by w:  
46 + w³ =27w  
w³ -27w +46=0

Wait, this is the same equation as before when I assumed x=y. So, we have w=2, or w= -1 +2√6 ≈3.898.

So, when w=2, then l=23/(2²)=23/4=5.75. So, the box is 5.75x2x2.

Alternatively, when w≈3.898, l≈23/(3.898)^2≈1.514.

So, in both cases, when two variables are equal, we have two possible boxes.

Now, let's compute l² + w² + h² in each case.

First case: l=5.75, w=2, h=2.

Sum of squares: (5.75)^2 + 2^2 +2^2=33.0625 +4 +4=41.0625.

Second case: l≈1.514, w≈3.898, h≈3.898.

Sum of squares: (1.514)^2 + 2*(3.898)^2 ≈2.292 + 2*(15.198)=2.292 +30.396≈32.688.

So, the first case gives a larger sum of squares, which is what I want because I'm trying to maximize l² + w² + h².

So, in this case, the maximum sum of squares is 41.0625, which is 657/16.

Wait, 5.75 is 23/4, so (23/4)^2=529/16. Then 2^2 is 4, which is 64/16. So, adding three times 4: 529/16 + 64/16 +64/16 = (529 +64 +64)/16 = 657/16. So, yes, that's correct.

So, in this case, the sum of squares is 657/16, so r² is (657/16)/4=657/(16*4)=657/64.

Wait, wait. No, wait. The radius is half the space diagonal. The space diagonal is sqrt(l² + w² + h²). So, the radius is (sqrt(l² + w² + h²))/2. Then, r² is (l² + w² + h²)/4. So, if l² + w² + h²=657/16, then r² is 657/(16*4)=657/64.

Simplify 657/64: Let's see if 657 and 64 have any common factors. 64 is 2^6. 657 divided by 3 is 219, 219 divided by 3 is 73. 73 is a prime. So, 657=3^2 *73. 64 is 2^6, so no common factors. So, 657/64 is already reduced.

So, p=657, q=64. Then, p+q=657+64=721.

Wait, but before I conclude, are there any other possibilities where l, w, h are not equal, but two variables are not equal, and the sum of squares is larger than 657/16? Or is 657/16 indeed the maximum?

I think because when we assumed two variables equal, we found the maximum sum of squares in that scenario, but perhaps the maximum overall is higher or lower? Hmm.

Wait, actually, another thought: suppose the box is not symmetric in any way, so all three variables are different. Could that lead to a higher sum of squares?

But determining that would require more complex analysis. Alternatively, since when we fixed two variables equal, we found a feasible solution, but perhaps there's another configuration where the sum is higher.

Alternatively, perhaps the maximum occurs when two variables are equal, so the case I considered is indeed the maximum.

Wait, but according to the Lagrangian equations, if the variables are not equal, then we can get another critical point. But since we couldn't solve that system easily, perhaps the maximum occurs when two variables are equal, which gives us the higher sum.

Alternatively, another approach: Using the AM-QM inequality.

We know that (l² + w² + h²)/3 ≥ ((lwh)^(2/3)).

But wait, not sure if that applies here. Alternatively, perhaps using the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality.

But perhaps, since we have two constraints, maybe we can use some substitution.

Let me consider using the method of substitution. Let me set S = l + w + h, P = lw + lh + wh =27, and V = lwh =23.

We need to find l² + w² + h², which is S² - 2P = S² -54.

So, to maximize l² + w² + h², we need to maximize S². So, maximize S.

So, the problem is to maximize S = l + w + h given that P=27 and V=23.

Is there a known inequality that relates S, P, V?

Yes, for positive real numbers, there's an inequality involving S, P, V. For example, using AM ≥ GM.

But perhaps it's better to consider the function S in terms of variables with fixed P and V.

Alternatively, perhaps we can express S in terms of variables.

Wait, I can use the inequality that for positive real numbers,

S^3 ≥ 27 V.

But S^3 ≥ 27*23=621, so S ≥ cube root of 621≈8.54.

But I'm not sure if that helps. Alternatively, perhaps using the method of Lagrange multipliers again, but focused on S.

Wait, but it's tricky because we have multiple constraints.

Alternatively, perhaps I can express S in terms of P and V, but I don't recall a direct formula.

Wait, another idea: For a given P and V, the maximum of S occurs when two variables are equal, and the third is as small as possible. Wait, but in our earlier case, when two variables were 2, and the third was 5.75, S=2+2+5.75=9.75.

Alternatively, when two variables were about 3.898, and the third about 1.514, S≈3.898+3.898+1.514≈9.309, which is less than 9.75.

So, in the first case, S=9.75, which is larger than the second case. So, if S is maximized when two variables are as small as possible, and the third is as large as possible, given the constraints.

So, if I can find the maximum S, which is 9.75, then l² + w² + h² = (9.75)^2 -54 =95.0625 -54=41.0625, which is the same as before.

So, this suggests that the maximum occurs when two variables are 2, and the third is 5.75.

Therefore, r^2 is (l² + w² + h²)/4= (657/16)/4=657/64.

So, p=657, q=64. They are coprime because 657 is 3^2*73, and 64 is 2^6, no common factors. So, p+q=657+64=721.

Wait, let me double-check to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.

So, surface area is 2(lw + lh + wh)=54, so lw + lh + wh=27.

Volume is lwh=23.

Assuming two variables are equal, say l=w=2, then h=23/(2*2)=23/4=5.75.

Check surface area: 2*(2*2 + 2*5.75 + 2*5.75)=2*(4 +11.5 +11.5)=2*(27)=54. Correct.

So, the surface area is satisfied. Volume is 2*2*5.75=23. Correct.

Thus, the sum of squares is 4 +4 + (23/4)^2=8 + (529/16)= (128 +529)/16=657/16.

Then, r² is 657/64, which reduces to 657/64. So, p+q=657+64=721.

I think that's correct.

To solve the problem, we need to find the radius squared of the smallest sphere that can contain any rectangular box from the set \(\mathcal{B}\), where each box has a surface area of 54 and a volume of 23. 

First, we note that the radius \(r\) of the sphere must be half the space diagonal of the box. The space diagonal \(d\) of a rectangular box with dimensions \(l\), \(w\), and \(h\) is given by:
\[
d = \sqrt{l^2 + w^2 + h^2}
\]
Thus, the radius \(r\) is:
\[
r = \frac{d}{2} = \frac{\sqrt{l^2 + w^2 + h^2}}{2}
\]
Therefore, \(r^2\) is:
\[
r^2 = \frac{l^2 + w^2 + h^2}{4}
\]

We aim to maximize \(l^2 + w^2 + h^2\) subject to the constraints:
\[
2(lw + lh + wh) = 54 \quad \text{and} \quad lwh = 23
\]
Simplifying the surface area constraint:
\[
lw + lh + wh = 27
\]

To find the maximum \(l^2 + w^2 + h^2\), we use the identity:
\[
(l + w + h)^2 = l^2 + w^2 + h^2 + 2(lw + lh + wh)
\]
Substituting \(lw + lh + wh = 27\):
\[
l^2 + w^2 + h^2 = (l + w + h)^2 - 54
\]
Thus, maximizing \(l^2 + w^2 + h^2\) is equivalent to maximizing \((l + w + h)^2\).

Assuming two variables are equal, say \(l = w = 2\), we find the third variable \(h\):
\[
h = \frac{23}{l^2} = \frac{23}{4} = 5.75
\]
Checking the surface area:
\[
2(lw + lh + wh) = 2(2 \cdot 2 + 2 \cdot 5.75 + 2 \cdot 5.75) = 2(4 + 11.5 + 11.5) = 54
\]
The sum of squares is:
\[
l^2 + w^2 + h^2 = 2^2 + 2^2 + (5.75)^2 = 4 + 4 + 33.0625 = 41.0625 = \frac{657}{16}
\]
Thus, \(r^2\) is:
\[
r^2 = \frac{657}{16 \cdot 4} = \frac{657}{64}
\]
Since 657 and 64 are coprime, we have \(p = 657\) and \(q = 64\). Therefore, \(p + q = 657 + 64 = 721\).

The final answer is:
\[
\boxed{721}
\]
