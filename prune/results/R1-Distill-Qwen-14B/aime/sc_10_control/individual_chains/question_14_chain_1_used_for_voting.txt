Okay, so I have this math problem to solve. Let me read it again and try to understand what it's asking.

The problem says: Let N be the greatest four-digit positive integer with the property that whenever one of its digits is changed to 1, the resulting number is divisible by 7. Then, Q and R are the quotient and remainder when N is divided by 1000. I need to find Q + R.

Hmm, interesting. So N is a four-digit number, the biggest possible, with this special property. The property is that changing any one of its digits to 1 makes the number divisible by 7. So, if I take N, which is a four-digit number, and change any single digit to 1, the resulting number is divisible by 7.

My goal is to find N, then compute Q and R when N is divided by 1000. Q is the quotient, so that's like the thousands digit of N, right? Because dividing by 1000 gives me the thousands place as the quotient and the last three digits as the remainder. So, Q + R would be the thousands digit plus the last three digits. For example, if N were 1234, Q would be 1 and R would be 234, so Q + R is 1 + 234 = 235.

Wait, actually, no. Wait, when you divide N by 1000, Q is the integer division result, which is the thousands digit, and R is the remainder, which is the last three digits. So, in terms of the number, if N is ABCD, then Q is A (the thousands digit) and R is BCD (the last three digits). So, Q + R would be A + BCD, which is a number formed by adding the thousands digit to the last three digits.

So, for N = ABCD, Q = A, R = BCD, so Q + R = A + 100B + 10C + D.

But the key point is that N is a four-digit number, and we need to find the largest such N with this property. So, let's focus on figuring out what N is.

So, the problem is about a four-digit number N where changing any digit to 1 makes it divisible by 7. So, for example, if N is ABCD, then changing A to 1 gives 1BCD, changing B to 1 gives A1CD, changing C to 1 gives AB1D, and changing D to 1 gives ABC1. Each of these changes should result in a number divisible by 7.

So, N is the largest four-digit number with this property. To find N, perhaps I should start from 9999 and check downwards, but that might take too long. Maybe I can find some constraints on N.

Let me think about the properties of N.

1. When changing any digit to 1, the new number is divisible by 7.

So, for each digit position (thousands, hundreds, tens, units), changing that digit to 1 results in a number divisible by 7.

Let me denote N as a four-digit number: N = a b c d, where a, b, c, d are digits, and a ≠ 0 since it's a four-digit number.

So, N = 1000a + 100b + 10c + d.

Now, changing each digit to 1:

1. Changing a to 1: 1000*1 + 100b + 10c + d = 1000 + 100b + 10c + d. Let's call this N1.

2. Changing b to 1: 1000a + 100*1 + 10c + d = 1000a + 100 + 10c + d. Let's call this N2.

3. Changing c to 1: 1000a + 100b + 10*1 + d = 1000a + 100b + 10 + d. Let's call this N3.

4. Changing d to 1: 1000a + 100b + 10c + 1. Let's call this N4.

Each of N1, N2, N3, N4 must be divisible by 7.

So, N1 ≡ 0 mod 7

N2 ≡ 0 mod 7

N3 ≡ 0 mod 7

N4 ≡ 0 mod 7

So, perhaps I can write these congruences.

Let me denote N as 1000a + 100b + 10c + d.

Then:

N1 = 1000 + 100b + 10c + d = (1000a + 100b + 10c + d) - 1000a + 1000 = N - 1000a + 1000.

Similarly, N2 = 1000a + 100 + 10c + d = N - 100b + 100.

N3 = 1000a + 100b + 10 + d = N - 10c + 10.

N4 = 1000a + 100b + 10c + 1 = N - d + 1.

Since N1, N2, N3, N4 are all divisible by 7, their modulo 7 should be 0.

So, let's write these:

1. N1 ≡ 0 mod 7 → (N - 1000a + 1000) ≡ 0 mod 7.

But N ≡ k mod 7, so (k - 1000a + 1000) ≡ 0 mod 7.

Wait, but 1000 mod 7 is something. Let me compute that.

1000 divided by 7: 7*142=994, so 1000 -994=6. So, 1000 ≡ 6 mod 7.

Similarly, 100 mod 7: 7*14=98, so 100-98=2. So, 100 ≡ 2 mod 7.

10 mod 7 is 3.

And 1 mod 7 is 1.

So, let's compute 1000a mod 7: Since 1000 ≡6, 1000a ≡6a mod7.

Similarly, 100b ≡2b mod7.

10c ≡3c mod7.

d ≡d mod7.

So, N = 1000a + 100b +10c +d ≡6a + 2b +3c +d mod7.

So, N ≡6a + 2b +3c +d mod7.

Similarly, N1 = N -1000a +1000 → mod7:

N1 ≡ (6a + 2b +3c +d) -6a +6 ≡ 2b +3c +d +6 ≡0 mod7.

Similarly, N2 = N -100b +100 → mod7:

N2 ≡(6a + 2b +3c +d) -2b +2 ≡6a +3c +d +2 ≡0 mod7.

N3 = N -10c +10 → mod7:

N3 ≡(6a +2b +3c +d) -3c +3 ≡6a +2b +d +3 ≡0 mod7.

N4 = N -d +1 → mod7:

N4 ≡(6a +2b +3c +d) -d +1 ≡6a +2b +3c +1 ≡0 mod7.

So, we have four congruence equations:

1. 2b +3c +d +6 ≡0 mod7  → Equation (1)
2. 6a +3c +d +2 ≡0 mod7  → Equation (2)
3. 6a +2b +d +3 ≡0 mod7  → Equation (3)
4. 6a +2b +3c +1 ≡0 mod7  → Equation (4)

So, now I have four equations with four variables: a, b, c, d. But, actually, a, b, c, d are digits, so they range from 0 to 9, with a ≥1.

Hmm, solving four equations mod7 may be a bit involved, but perhaps I can manipulate them to find relationships.

Let me see if I can subtract some equations to eliminate variables.

First, let me write all four equations:

Equation (1): 2b +3c +d ≡1 mod7 (since 6 is subtracted to get 0, so 6 ≡-1 mod7. So 2b +3c +d ≡1 mod7? Wait, let me double-check.

Wait, Equation (1): 2b +3c +d +6 ≡0 mod7 → 2b +3c +d ≡-6 mod7. But -6 mod7 is 1, because 7-6=1. So, Equation (1): 2b +3c +d ≡1 mod7.

Similarly, Equation (2): 6a +3c +d ≡-2 mod7 → 6a +3c +d ≡5 mod7 (since -2 mod7 is 5).

Equation (3): 6a +2b +d ≡-3 mod7 → 6a +2b +d ≡4 mod7 (because -3 mod7 is 4).

Equation (4): 6a +2b +3c ≡-1 mod7 → 6a +2b +3c ≡6 mod7 (since -1 mod7 is 6).

So, now the equations are:

1. 2b +3c +d ≡1 mod7 → equation (1)
2. 6a +3c +d ≡5 mod7 → equation (2)
3. 6a +2b +d ≡4 mod7 → equation (3)
4. 6a +2b +3c ≡6 mod7 → equation (4)

Hmm, perhaps I can subtract equation (1) from equation (2):

Equation (2) - Equation (1):

(6a +3c +d) - (2b +3c +d) ≡5 -1 mod7 → 6a -2b ≡4 mod7.

So, 6a -2b ≡4 mod7.

Simplify: Let's divide both sides by 2 (since 2 and 7 are coprime, so this is allowed):

3a - b ≡2 mod7 → equation (5).

Similarly, maybe subtract equation (3) from equation (2):

Equation (2) - Equation (3):

(6a +3c +d) - (6a +2b +d) ≡5 -4 mod7 → 3c -2b ≡1 mod7 → equation (6).

Similarly, equation (4): 6a +2b +3c ≡6 mod7.

Let me see if I can express equation (4) in terms of equation (6).

From equation (6): 3c ≡2b +1 mod7.

Substitute into equation (4):

6a +2b + (2b +1) ≡6 mod7 → 6a +4b +1 ≡6 mod7 → 6a +4b ≡5 mod7.

Let me write that as equation (7): 6a +4b ≡5 mod7.

Now, from equation (5): 3a - b ≡2 mod7.

Let me solve equation (5) for b:

3a - b ≡2 → -b ≡ -3a +2 → b ≡3a -2 mod7.

So, b ≡3a -2 mod7.

So, b = 3a -2 + 7k, where k is some integer.

But since b is a digit (0-9), we can find possible values based on a.

Similarly, from equation (7): 6a +4b ≡5 mod7.

We can substitute b from equation (5) into equation (7).

So, b ≡3a -2 mod7.

So, 6a +4*(3a -2) ≡5 mod7.

Compute that:

6a +12a -8 ≡5 mod7.

Combine like terms:

(6a +12a) =18a → 18a mod7: 18 divided by7 is 2*7=14, remainder 4. So 18a ≡4a mod7.

-8 mod7: Since 7*1=7, 8-7=1, so -8 ≡-1 mod7, which is 6 mod7.

So, equation becomes:

4a +6 ≡5 mod7 → 4a ≡-1 mod7 → 4a ≡6 mod7.

Solve for a: 4a ≡6 mod7.

Multiply both sides by the inverse of 4 mod7. The inverse of 4 mod7 is 2 because 4*2=8≡1 mod7.

So, a ≡6*2 ≡12 ≡5 mod7.

So, a ≡5 mod7.

Since a is a digit from 1 to9, possible values are a=5 or a=5+7=12, but 12 is invalid as a digit. So, a=5.

So, a=5.

Now, from equation (5): b ≡3a -2 mod7.

a=5, so 3*5=15; 15 -2=13. 13 mod7 is 6, because 7*1=7, 13-7=6.

So, b ≡6 mod7. So, b can be 6 or 6+7=13. But b must be a digit (0-9), so b=6.

So, a=5, b=6.

Now, let's plug a=5 and b=6 into equation (6): 3c ≡2b +1 mod7.

2b=12 → 12 mod7 is 5. So, 3c ≡5 +1=6 mod7.

So, 3c ≡6 mod7 → c ≡2 mod7 (since 3*2=6). So, c=2 or c=2+7=9. So, possible c=2 or c=9.

So, c=2 or 9.

Now, let's proceed to find d.

From equation (1): 2b +3c +d ≡1 mod7.

We have b=6, so 2b=12≡5 mod7.

So, 5 +3c +d ≡1 mod7 → 3c +d ≡-4 mod7 → 3c +d ≡3 mod7 (since -4 mod7 is 3).

So, 3c +d ≡3 mod7.

We have c=2 or 9.

Case 1: c=2.

Then, 3*2=6 → 6 +d ≡3 mod7 → d ≡3-6 mod7 → d≡-3≡4 mod7.

So, d can be 4 or 4+7=11, but d is a digit, so d=4.

Case 2: c=9.

3*9=27 →27 mod7: 7*3=21, 27-21=6 → 6 +d ≡3 mod7 → d≡3-6 mod7 → d≡-3≡4 mod7.

So, d=4 or 11, but d=4.

So, in both cases, d=4.

So, now, possible N is a=5, b=6, c=2 or c=9, d=4.

So, two possibilities: N=5624 or N=5694.

But we need the greatest four-digit number, so 5694 is larger than 5624.

But wait, let me check if both of these numbers satisfy all four conditions.

Let me check N=5694 first.

Check N1: Changing a to 1: 1694.

Is 1694 divisible by7? Let's compute 1694 ÷7.

7*242=1694. So yes, 1694 is divisible by7.

N2: Changing b to1: 5194.

5194 ÷7: 7*742=5194, so yes.

N3: Changing c to1: 5614.

5614 ÷7: 7*802=5614. So, yes.

N4: Changing d to1: 5691.

5691 ÷7: 7*813=5691. Yes.

So, N=5694 satisfies all four conditions.

Now, check N=5624.

N1: Changing a to1:1624.

1624 ÷7: 7*232=1624. So, yes.

N2: Changing b to1: 5124.

5124 ÷7: 7*732=5124. Yes.

N3: Changing c to1: 5614.

As before, 5614 ÷7=802. So, yes.

N4: Changing d to1: 5621.

5621 ÷7: 7*803=5621. So, yes.

So, both N=5624 and N=5694 satisfy all the conditions.

But since we're looking for the greatest N, 5694 is larger than 5624.

So, N=5694.

But wait, let me check if there are any larger numbers possible. Because 5694 is a candidate, but perhaps there's a larger number beyond 5694 that meets the conditions.

Wait, how did we arrive at a=5? Because when solving the congruences, we found a ≡5 mod7, so the next possible a would be 5+7=12, but a must be a digit (1-9), so a=5 is the only possibility.

So, a=5, b=6. Then, c can be 2 or9, but 9 gives a larger number.

So, yes, N=5694 is the largest four-digit number with that property.

Wait, but just to be thorough, is there a possibility that a=5, b=6, c=9, d=4 is the largest, but if I can have a higher number, perhaps with a=5, b=6, c=9, d=4 is the maximum.

Wait, 5694 is the maximum possible with a=5, b=6, c=9, d=4.

Alternatively, if there were a number with a=5, b=6, c=9, d=4, which is 5694, but maybe a higher a? No, because a=5 is fixed.

Wait, a can't be higher than 5 because when solving the congruence, a ≡5 mod7, so the next possible a would be 12, which is invalid. So, a=5 is the maximum possible thousands digit, so N=5694 is indeed the largest possible.

But let me try to see if I made a mistake in assuming that a=5 is the only solution. Let me re-examine the steps.

We had equation (5): 3a - b ≡2 mod7.

Then equation (7): 6a +4b ≡5 mod7.

We substituted b in terms of a into equation (7) and found a ≡5 mod7.

So, a can be 5 or 12, but a must be a digit, so only 5.

So, a=5 is fixed, so b=6 is fixed.

Then, c can be 2 or9, and d=4.

So, the possible N are 5624 and 5694, with 5694 being the larger one.

Hence, N=5694.

So, now, the next step is to compute Q and R when N is divided by1000.

N=5694.

Divide by1000: 5694 ÷1000=5.694.

So, Q=5 (the quotient), R=694 (the remainder).

So, Q+R=5+694=699.

Wait, is that correct?

Wait, 5694 divided by1000 is 5 with a remainder of 694. So yes.

But let me verify:

1000*5=5000.

5694 -5000=694.

Yes, so Q=5, R=694.

So, Q+R=5+694=699.

Hmm, 5+694 is 699.

Wait, but let me think if I could have a larger N beyond 5694.

Wait, N is a four-digit number, so the maximum possible is 9999. But N has to satisfy the condition that changing any digit to1 makes it divisible by7.

Is there a higher N than 5694 that satisfies this condition?

Well, since a=5 is fixed, the thousands digit is 5, so the maximum possible N with a=5 is 5999, but our N is 5694, which is less than 5999.

Wait, but that suggests that perhaps my reasoning is wrong because maybe there's a larger N with a=5 but higher digits in b, c, d.

Wait, but according to our earlier analysis, a=5, b=6, c=9, d=4 is the maximum possible.

Wait, but let me try to see if N could be higher. Suppose a=5, b=7. Then, would that be possible?

But according to our previous steps, b must be ≡6 mod7, so b=6 or 13 (invalid). So, b=6 is fixed. So, b can't be higher than 6.

Similarly, c can be 2 or9, so 9 is the maximum.

d=4 is fixed.

So, N=5694 is indeed the maximum possible.

Wait, but wait a second. If I have a=5, b=6, c=9, d=4, is there a way to set d to a higher digit while still satisfying the conditions?

Wait, when we solved for d, we found d=4 in both cases of c=2 and c=9. So, d is fixed at 4.

So, even if c is 9, d must be 4. So, d can't be higher.

So, N=5694 is the maximum.

Therefore, Q=5 and R=694, so Q+R=699.

But wait, before I conclude, let me check if N=5694 is indeed the maximum possible. Let me consider N=5624, which is smaller than 5694, so 5694 is larger.

But let me verify if N=5694 is the maximum.

Wait, another thought: Could there be a number with a=5, b=6, c=9, d=4, which is 5694, but perhaps a higher digit in c beyond 9? No, since c is a single digit, 9 is the maximum.

So, yes, 5694 is the greatest four-digit number meeting the condition.

So, Q=5, R=694. Thus, Q+R=5 + 694 = 699.

Wait, but let me just confirm if 5694 is indeed the maximum. Let's see if I can find a higher number, say 57**.

Wait, but according to the equations, a=5 is fixed, and b=6 is fixed, so a=5, b=6 is the maximum possible for the thousands and hundreds digits. So, the maximum number is 5694.

Wait, but what about the thousands digit. Could a be higher, like 5+7=12? No, because a must be a single digit. So, a=5 is the highest possible. So, 5694 is the maximum.

Therefore, I think I've reasoned through this correctly, and the answer should be 699.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To solve the problem, we need to find the greatest four-digit number \( N \) such that changing any one of its digits to 1 results in a number divisible by 7. We then compute \( Q \) and \( R \), the quotient and remainder when \( N \) is divided by 1000, and find \( Q + R \).

### Step-by-Step Solution

1. **Understanding the Problem**:
   - \( N \) is a four-digit number, denoted as \( ABCD \), where \( A, B, C, D \) are digits, and \( A \neq 0 \).
   - Changing any digit of \( N \) to 1 results in a number divisible by 7.

2. **Setting Up Equations**:
   - Let \( N = 1000A + 100B + 10C + D \).
   - When changing each digit to 1, we get four new numbers:
     - Changing \( A \) to 1: \( 1000 + 100B + 10C + D \)
     - Changing \( B \) to 1: \( 1000A + 100 + 10C + D \)
     - Changing \( C \) to 1: \( 1000A + 100B + 10 + D \)
     - Changing \( D \) to 1: \( 1000A + 100B + 10C + 1 \)
   - Each of these numbers must be divisible by 7.

3. **Modular Arithmetic**:
   - Compute \( 1000 \mod 7 = 6 \), \( 100 \mod 7 = 2 \), \( 10 \mod 7 = 3 \), and \( 1 \mod 7 = 1 \).
   - Express \( N \) modulo 7: \( N \equiv 6A + 2B + 3C + D \mod 7 \).
   - For each modified number, set up congruences modulo 7 and solve the resulting system of equations.

4. **Solving the System of Congruences**:
   - Through algebraic manipulation and substitution, we find:
     - \( A \equiv 5 \mod 7 \), so \( A = 5 \) (since \( A \) is a digit).
     - \( B \equiv 6 \mod 7 \), so \( B = 6 \).
     - \( C \) can be 2 or 9, but to maximize \( N \), we choose \( C = 9 \).
     - \( D \equiv 4 \mod 7 \), so \( D = 4 \).

5. **Constructing \( N \)**:
   - Substituting the values, \( N = 5694 \).

6. **Computing \( Q \) and \( R \)**:
   - Divide \( N \) by 1000: \( 5694 \div 1000 = 5 \) with a remainder of 694.
   - Thus, \( Q = 5 \) and \( R = 694 \).

7. **Final Calculation**:
   - \( Q + R = 5 + 694 = 699 \).

### Final Answer
The value of \( Q + R \) is \(\boxed{699}\).
