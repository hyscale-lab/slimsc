Okay, so I'm trying to solve this problem where I need to figure out how many ways I can fill a 2x3 grid with digits (0-9) such that two conditions are satisfied. The first condition is that when I read the first row left to right, it forms a two-digit number, and the second row forms another two-digit number. The sum of these two numbers should be 999. The second condition is that when I read each column top to bottom, each forms a two-digit number, and the sum of these three numbers should be 99. 

Hmm, let me start by visualizing the grid. It's a 2x3 grid, so there are two rows and three columns. Let me label the cells as follows:

\[
\begin{array}{|c|c|c|}
\hline
a & b & c \\
\hline
d & e & f \\
\hline
\end{array}
\]

So, the first row is the two-digit number formed by a and b, and the second row is the two-digit number formed by d and e. Wait, no, actually, the first row is a three-digit number? Wait, hold on, no. Wait, the problem says "the sum of the two numbers formed by reading left to right." Oh, wait, the grid is 2x3, so each row has three cells. So each row is a three-digit number. Wait, the example given in the problem is:

\[
\begin{array}{|c|c|c|}
\hline
0 & 0 & 8 \\
\hline
9 & 9 & 1 \\
\hline
\end{array}
\]

And it says that 8 + 991 = 999. Wait, so the first row is 008, which is 8, and the second row is 991, which is 991. So, yeah, each row is a three-digit number. So, the first condition is that the sum of the two three-digit numbers is 999. 

The second condition is that when you read each column top to bottom, each column forms a two-digit number. So, the first column is ad, the second is be, the third is cf. Each of these is a two-digit number. The sum of these three two-digit numbers is 99. 

So, to rephrase: The grid is 2x3, each cell is a digit, the sum of the two three-digit numbers (top row and bottom row) is 999, and the sum of the three two-digit numbers (each column) is 99. I need to find how many such grids exist.

Okay, so let's define the numbers. Let me call the top row ABC, which is the three-digit number 100a + 10b + c. Similarly, the bottom row is DEF, which is 100d + 10e + f. The sum of these two numbers is 999, so:

100a + 10b + c + 100d + 10e + f = 999.

Let me rearrange this equation:

100(a + d) + 10(b + e) + (c + f) = 999.

So, 100(a + d) + 10(b + e) + (c + f) = 999.

That's equation one.

Now, the second condition is about the columns. Each column is a two-digit number. The first column is ad, which is 10a + d. The second column is be, which is 10b + e. The third column is cf, which is 10c + f. The sum of these is 99:

(10a + d) + (10b + e) + (10c + f) = 99.

Let me write that as:

10(a + b + c) + (d + e + f) = 99.

That's equation two.

So, now I have two equations:

1) 100(a + d) + 10(b + e) + (c + f) = 999.

2) 10(a + b + c) + (d + e + f) = 99.

Hmm, I can perhaps denote some variables to simplify this. Let me let S1 = a + d, S2 = b + e, S3 = c + f. Then equation 1 becomes:

100*S1 + 10*S2 + S3 = 999.

Also, equation 2: 10(a + b + c) + (d + e + f) = 99.

But wait, if I let T1 = a + b + c, and T2 = d + e + f, then equation 2 is 10*T1 + T2 = 99.

But also, S1 = a + d, S2 = b + e, S3 = c + f.

So, S1 = a + d, so d = S1 - a.

Similarly, e = S2 - b.

Similarly, f = S3 - c.

Wait, but T2 = d + e + f = (S1 - a) + (S2 - b) + (S3 - c) = (S1 + S2 + S3) - (a + b + c) = (S1 + S2 + S3) - T1.

But equation 2 is 10*T1 + T2 = 99.

So substituting T2:

10*T1 + (S1 + S2 + S3 - T1) = 99.

Simplify:

10*T1 + S1 + S2 + S3 - T1 = 99.

Which becomes:

9*T1 + S1 + S2 + S3 = 99.

From equation 1: 100*S1 + 10*S2 + S3 = 999.

So, now we have:

Equation 1: 100 S1 + 10 S2 + S3 = 999.

Equation 3: 9 T1 + S1 + S2 + S3 = 99.

Also, T1 = a + b + c.

We need to find integers S1, S2, S3, T1 that satisfy these equations, with the constraints that each of a, b, c, d, e, f are digits (0-9). 

Let me think about equation 1: 100 S1 + 10 S2 + S3 = 999. So, 100 S1 is going to be the hundreds place, 10 S2 the tens, and S3 the units. But 999 is a three-digit number. So 100 S1 + 10 S2 + S3 = 999, so S1 must be 9, because 100*9=900, and 900 + 90 + 9 = 999. So S1=9, S2=9, S3=9.

Wait, let me check that:

100*9 + 10*9 +9= 900 +90 +9=999. Yes, that's correct. So, S1=9, S2=9, S3=9. So, that's fixed. So, equation 1 gives us S1=9, S2=9, S3=9.

So, equation 3 becomes:

9 T1 + 9 + 9 +9 =99.

So, 9 T1 +27=99.

Subtract 27 from both sides: 9 T1=72.

Thus, T1=8.

So, T1=8, which is a + b + c=8.

So, now, with S1=9, S2=9, S3=9, T1=8.

Now, let's go back to the variables:

S1 = a + d =9. So, d =9 -a.

Similarly, S2= b + e=9. So, e=9 -b.

Similarly, S3= c + f=9. So, f=9 -c.

Also, T1 = a + b + c=8.

So, the variables are:

d=9 -a,

e=9 -b,

f=9 -c,

with a, b, c being digits (0-9), and d, e, f also digits (0-9).

But, since d, e, f are digits, 9 -a, 9 -b, 9 -c must all be between 0 and 9. So, a, b, c must be between 0 and 9 as well, but also, 9 -a >=0 => a <=9, which is already satisfied as a is a digit.

So, the constraints are:

a, b, c are digits (0-9),

and a + b + c=8.

Additionally, since d, e, f=9 -a, 9 -b,9 -c, which must also be digits (0-9). So, 9 -a >=0 --> a <=9, which is already true. Similarly for b and c. So, no additional constraints beyond a, b, c being digits and their sum being 8.

So, the problem reduces to finding the number of non-negative integer solutions to a + b + c =8, where a, b, c are digits (i.e., 0 <= a, b, c <=9).

But since 8 is less than 9, all solutions automatically satisfy a, b, c <=8, which is less than 9, so no need to worry about exceeding 9. So, all solutions are valid.

So, the number of solutions is the number of non-negative integer triples (a, b, c) such that a + b + c=8.

This is a classic stars and bars problem. The formula for the number of non-negative integer solutions is C(n + k -1, k -1), where n is the total, k the number of variables. So, here n=8, k=3.

So, number of solutions is C(8 +3 -1, 3 -1)=C(10,2)=45.

But wait, wait. Because a, b, c are digits, which can be 0-9, but in this case, since their sum is 8, none of them can exceed 8, which is within the digit limit. So, all 45 solutions are valid.

But wait, let me confirm: for example, if a=8, then b + c=0, which implies b=0, c=0. Similarly, a=7, then b + c=1, which has two solutions, etc. So yes, it's 45.

So, does that mean there are 45 possible grids? Wait, no, because each solution (a,b,c) defines d, e, f as 9 -a, 9 -b, 9 -c. But, we need to make sure that d, e, f are digits as well. But since a, b, c <=8, their complements 9 -a, 9 -b,9 -c are >=1. Wait, no, let's see:

If a=0, then d=9, which is a digit.

If a=9, which is possible, then d=0. But in this case, a can be at most 8, because a + b + c=8, so a cannot be 9. So, a, b, c can be from 0 to 8, so d, e, f=9 -a, 9 -b,9 -c will be from 1 to 9. So, all digits.

Therefore, each solution (a,b,c) corresponds to a unique grid.

Thus, the number of grids is equal to the number of solutions (a,b,c), which is 45. So, the answer is 45.

Wait, but let me test with the example given in the problem.

The example is:

0 0 8

9 9 1

So, a=0, b=0, c=8.

Then, d=9 -0=9, e=9 -0=9, f=9 -8=1.

So, that's the grid.

And that grid satisfies the conditions: top row is 008=8, bottom row is 991=991, sum is 8+991=999. Columns: 09=9, 09=9, 81=81. Sum is 9+9+81=99. Yes, that works.

Another example: let's take a=8, b=0, c=0.

Then, d=1, e=9, f=9.

So, the grid is:

8 0 0

1 9 9

Top row is 800, bottom row is 199. Sum is 800 +199=999.

Columns: 81=81, 09=9, 09=9. Sum is 81 +9 +9=99. That works.

Another test case: a=4, b=3, c=1.

d=5, e=6, f=8.

Grid:

4 3 1

5 6 8

Top row: 431, bottom row:568. Sum=431 +568= 999. Columns:45=45, 36=36, 18=18. Sum=45+36+18=99. Correct.

So, seems like the logic is correct. Each solution (a,b,c) adds up to 8, and the other variables are determined uniquely, and all are digits.

Therefore, the total number of such grids is the number of non-negative integer solutions to a + b + c=8, which is 45.

Wait, but hang on, I think I may have made a mistake here. Because even though a, b, c are digits, do all the variables d, e, f also have to be digits? But since d=9 -a, and a is between 0 and 8, d is between 1 and 9, which is allowed. Similarly, e and f are between 1 and 9. So, all are valid digits. So, no constraints are violated.

So yes, all 45 solutions are valid.

Wait, but let me think again: the variables a, b, c can be zero, but the problem says "a digit" in each cell. So, zero is allowed.

Therefore, the number of grids is 45. So, the answer is 45, which is 45, so in a box: \boxed{45}

But wait, hold on a second. Let me think again about the two equations.

We have S1=9, S2=9, S3=9.

And T1=8.

So, a + d=9, b + e=9, c + f=9.

And a + b + c=8.

So, with a + d=9, d=9 -a.

Similarly, e=9 -b, f=9 -c.

So, d + e + f= (9 -a) + (9 -b) + (9 -c)=27 - (a + b + c)=27 -8=19.

But in equation 2, 10*T1 + T2=99.

We have T2=19.

So, 10*8 +19=80 +19=99.

Which is correct.

But, another thought: since a, b, c are digits from 0-8 (since a + b + c=8), and d=9 -a, which is from 1-9.

So, all the digits are valid, no leading zeros? Wait, the problem doesn't specify that the numbers cannot have leading zeros. The example has the top row as 008, which is allowed. So, leading zeros are permitted.

Therefore, all 45 configurations are acceptable.

Wait, but let's think about the grid.

In the first row, the number is 100a + 10b + c.

If a is zero, then the first number is 00c, which is a two-digit number? Wait, no, the grid is 2x3, so each row is a three-digit number, even if the first digit is zero. So, 008 is 8, 091 is 91, etc. So, leading zeros are allowed in the numbers.

Same with the columns: each column is a two-digit number, so 09 is 9, which is fine.

So, all the digits are allowed, including leading zeros.

Therefore, the count is 45.

But wait, another thought: the problem says "the number formed by reading left to right" for each row. If the first row is 008, that's 8, but is 008 considered a three-digit number or a one-digit number? Because 008 is numerically equal to 8. But in the problem, when adding the two numbers, they are 8 and 991, which sum to 999. So, yes, the leading zeros are ignored in terms of the numerical value, but the grid itself is allowed to have leading zeros.

So, the digits can be zero, so all 45 possibilities are acceptable.

Therefore, the answer is 45.

To solve the problem, we need to fill a 2x3 grid with digits such that the sum of the two three-digit numbers formed by the rows is 999, and the sum of the three two-digit numbers formed by the columns is 99.

1. **Define Variables and Equations:**
   - Let the grid be:
     \[
     \begin{array}{|c|c|c|}
     \hline
     a & b & c \\
     \hline
     d & e & f \\
     \hline
     \end{array}
     \]
   - The sum of the two three-digit numbers (rows) is 999:
     \[
     100a + 10b + c + 100d + 10e + f = 999
     \]
   - The sum of the three two-digit numbers (columns) is 99:
     \[
     (10a + d) + (10b + e) + (10c + f) = 99
     \]

2. **Simplify the Equations:**
   - Let \( S1 = a + d \), \( S2 = b + e \), \( S3 = c + f \). The first equation becomes:
     \[
     100S1 + 10S2 + S3 = 999
     \]
   - The second equation can be rewritten as:
     \[
     10(a + b + c) + (d + e + f) = 99
     \]
   - Let \( T1 = a + b + c \) and \( T2 = d + e + f \). Substituting \( T2 = S1 + S2 + S3 - T1 \) into the second equation:
     \[
     10T1 + (S1 + S2 + S3 - T1) = 99 \implies 9T1 + S1 + S2 + S3 = 99
     \]

3. **Solve the Equations:**
   - From the first equation, \( 100S1 + 10S2 + S3 = 999 \), we find \( S1 = 9 \), \( S2 = 9 \), and \( S3 = 9 \).
   - Substituting these into the second equation:
     \[
     9T1 + 9 + 9 + 9 = 99 \implies 9T1 = 72 \implies T1 = 8
     \]
   - Thus, \( a + b + c = 8 \), and \( d = 9 - a \), \( e = 9 - b \), \( f = 9 - c \).

4. **Count the Solutions:**
   - The number of non-negative integer solutions to \( a + b + c = 8 \) is given by the stars and bars method:
     \[
     \binom{8 + 3 - 1}{3 - 1} = \binom{10}{2} = 45
     \]
   - Each solution corresponds to a valid grid configuration.

Thus, the number of ways to fill the grid is \(\boxed{45}\).
