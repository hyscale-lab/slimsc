Alright, let's tackle this problem. Hmm, okay, we need to find the number of triples of nonnegative integers (a, b, c) such that a + b + c = 300 and a²b + a²c + b²a + b²c + c²a + c²b = 6,000,000. 

First, I should understand what the problem is asking. We have three variables, a, b, and c, all nonnegative integers. Their sum is 300, and another expression involving their squares and products equals 6 million. So, it's a system of equations with constraints on the variables.

Let me write down what's given:

1. a + b + c = 300
2. a²b + a²c + b²a + b²c + c²a + c²b = 6,000,000

I need to find the number of triples (a, b, c) that satisfy both equations.

Looking at the second equation, it looks a bit complicated. Maybe I can factor it or express it in terms of the sum or other symmetric expressions.

Let me see. The expression is a²b + a²c + b²a + b²c + c²a + c²b. I can factor this as:

a²(b + c) + b²(a + c) + c²(a + b)

Yes, that's correct. So, factoring each term accordingly.

Now, since a + b + c = 300, I know that b + c = 300 - a, a + c = 300 - b, and a + b = 300 - c. So, I can substitute these into the expression.

Let me substitute each part:

a²(300 - a) + b²(300 - b) + c²(300 - c)

So, the second equation becomes:

a²(300 - a) + b²(300 - b) + c²(300 - c) = 6,000,000

Hmm, that's a bit simpler. Let me expand each term:

300a² - a³ + 300b² - b³ + 300c² - c³ = 6,000,000

So, combining like terms:

300(a² + b² + c²) - (a³ + b³ + c³) = 6,000,000

Hmm, okay. So, now I have an equation involving a² + b² + c² and a³ + b³ + c³.

I recall that there are some identities involving sums of powers. Let me think about how to relate these to the given equations.

We know that (a + b + c)² = a² + b² + c² + 2(ab + bc + ac). Since a + b + c = 300, we can write:

300² = a² + b² + c² + 2(ab + bc + ac)

Which simplifies to:

90,000 = a² + b² + c² + 2(ab + bc + ac)

So, if I can find ab + bc + ac, that might help. Let me denote S = a + b + c = 300, Q = ab + bc + ac, and P = abc.

Wait, but I'm not sure if that will directly help, but let me see. From the equation above, I can write:

a² + b² + c² = 90,000 - 2Q

So, substituting back into our earlier equation:

300(a² + b² + c²) - (a³ + b³ + c³) = 6,000,000

Substituting a² + b² + c²:

300(90,000 - 2Q) - (a³ + b³ + c³) = 6,000,000

Calculating 300 * 90,000: that's 27,000,000. Then, 300*(-2Q) is -600Q. So:

27,000,000 - 600Q - (a³ + b³ + c³) = 6,000,000

Let me rearrange this:

- (a³ + b³ + c³) = 6,000,000 - 27,000,000 + 600Q

Which is:

- (a³ + b³ + c³) = -21,000,000 + 600Q

Multiply both sides by -1:

a³ + b³ + c³ = 21,000,000 - 600Q

So, now I have an expression for a³ + b³ + c³ in terms of Q. Hmm.

I know another identity for a³ + b³ + c³. It is:

a³ + b³ + c³ = (a + b + c)^3 - 3(a + b + c)(ab + bc + ac) + 3abc

So, substituting S = 300, Q = ab + bc + ac, and P = abc:

a³ + b³ + c³ = 300^3 - 3*300*Q + 3P

Compute 300^3: 300*300 = 90,000; 90,000*300 = 27,000,000.

So,

a³ + b³ + c³ = 27,000,000 - 900Q + 3P

But from earlier, we have:

a³ + b³ + c³ = 21,000,000 - 600Q

So, setting them equal:

27,000,000 - 900Q + 3P = 21,000,000 - 600Q

Subtract 21,000,000 from both sides:

6,000,000 - 900Q + 3P = -600Q

Bring all terms to one side:

6,000,000 - 900Q + 3P + 600Q = 0

Combine like terms:

6,000,000 - 300Q + 3P = 0

Divide both sides by 3:

2,000,000 - 100Q + P = 0

So, P = 100Q - 2,000,000

Hmm, so P is expressed in terms of Q.

So, now I have:

From the earlier equation, when I expressed a² + b² + c² = 90,000 - 2Q

And we also have P = 100Q - 2,000,000

But I'm not sure yet how to proceed. Maybe I can relate Q and P in another way.

Wait, perhaps I can use the equation involving Q and P in terms of the variables.

Wait, another thought: perhaps I can express the second equation in terms of Q.

Wait, let me think again.

We have P = 100Q - 2,000,000

But also, from the equation:

a³ + b³ + c³ = 21,000,000 - 600Q

Which we also expressed as 27,000,000 - 900Q + 3P

So, equating, we get:

27,000,000 - 900Q + 3P = 21,000,000 - 600Q

Which led to P = 100Q - 2,000,000

So, now perhaps I can find Q in terms of other variables.

Alternatively, maybe I can express Q in terms of the variables.

Wait, let me think about the possible values of a, b, c.

Since a, b, c are nonnegative integers, and their sum is 300, each can be as large as 300, but their squares and products lead to a sum of 6,000,000.

Wait, perhaps the variables are such that two of them are zero? Let me check that.

If, say, a = 0, then the second equation becomes 0 + 0 + b²*0 + b²c + c²*0 + c²b = 0 + 0 + 0 + b²c + 0 + c²b = b c (b + c) = 6,000,000.

But since a=0, then b + c = 300.

So, b c (300) = 6,000,000.

So, 300 b c = 6,000,000

Divide both sides by 300:

b c = 20,000

So, when a=0, we have b + c = 300, and b c = 20,000.

So, the number of solutions for (b, c) is the number of pairs such that b + c = 300 and b c = 20,000.

We can solve for b and c.

Let me denote b and c as roots of the quadratic equation x² - (300)x + 20,000 = 0.

Compute discriminant D = 300² - 4*1*20,000 = 90,000 - 80,000 = 10,000.

Square root of 10,000 is 100.

So, roots are [300 ± 100]/2. So, (300 + 100)/2 = 200, and (300 - 100)/2 = 100.

So, the roots are 200 and 100. So, the pairs (b, c) are (200, 100) and (100, 200).

So, when a=0, there are two solutions: (0, 200, 100) and (0, 100, 200).

But since a, b, c are nonnegative integers, and the order matters, so each such solution counts as a distinct triple.

Wait, but wait, the variables are ordered, so (a, b, c) is ordered. So, if a=0, then (0,200,100) and (0,100,200) are two distinct solutions.

Similarly, if b=0, then we'd have similar solutions, and same with c=0.

So, let me check what happens when b=0.

If b=0, then a + c = 300, and the second equation becomes a²*0 + a² c + 0 + 0 + c² a + c²*0 = a² c + c² a = a c (a + c) = 6,000,000.

Again, since a + c = 300, so a c * 300 = 6,000,000 → a c = 20,000.

So, same as before: a c = 20,000, a + c = 300.

Which gives the same quadratic equation, leading to a=200, c=100 or a=100, c=200.

So, the triples would be (200, 0, 100) and (100, 0, 200).

Similarly, if c=0, then a + b = 300, and the second equation becomes a²b + a²*0 + b²a + b²*0 + 0 + 0 = a² b + b² a = a b (a + b) = 6,000,000.

Again, a + b = 300, so a b * 300 = 6,000,000 → a b = 20,000.

Which leads to a=200, b=100 or a=100, b=200. So, the triples (200, 100, 0) and (100, 200, 0).

So, in total, when any one variable is zero, we get 2 solutions for each case.

But since the variables are a, b, c, each can be zero, so 3 variables × 2 solutions each = 6 solutions when one variable is zero.

Wait, but for each variable being zero, we have 2 solutions, so 3 × 2 = 6 triples where exactly one variable is zero.

Now, but are there any triples where two variables are zero? Let's check.

Suppose two variables are zero, say a=0 and b=0. Then c=300. Then, the second equation becomes 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 = 0 ≠ 6,000,000. So, no solution in this case.

Similarly, any two variables being zero would lead to the second equation being zero, which doesn't equal 6,000,000. So, no solutions with two variables zero.

So, up to now, we have 6 triples where exactly one variable is zero, and the other two are 200 and 100 in some order.

But wait, let me think, are there other solutions where none of the variables are zero?

Because so far, we only considered cases where one variable is zero, but perhaps there are solutions where all a, b, c are positive integers.

So, let's explore that.

If a, b, c are all positive integers, then none are zero. Let me see if such solutions exist.

In that case, all a, b, c are at least 1.

So, we have a + b + c = 300.

And the second equation is a²b + a²c + b²a + b²c + c²a + c²b = 6,000,000.

Which we transformed earlier into:

300(a² + b² + c²) - (a³ + b³ + c³) = 6,000,000

Which led to:

a³ + b³ + c³ = 21,000,000 - 600Q

And using another identity, we had:

a³ + b³ + c³ = 27,000,000 - 900Q + 3P

Which led to:

27,000,000 - 900Q + 3P = 21,000,000 - 600Q

Simplifying, we found:

P = 100Q - 2,000,000

So, P = abc = 100Q - 2,000,000.

So, we have Q = ab + bc + ac, and P = abc.

We can think of this as a cubic equation in terms of the roots a, b, c. So, the monic cubic polynomial with roots a, b, c is:

x³ - Sx² + Qx - P = 0

Which becomes:

x³ - 300x² + Qx - (100Q - 2,000,000) = 0

Simplify:

x³ - 300x² + Qx - 100Q + 2,000,000 = 0

Factor terms with Q:

x³ - 300x² + Q(x - 100) + 2,000,000 = 0

Hmm, not sure if that helps. Maybe I can think of Q in terms of other variables.

Alternatively, perhaps I can express Q as a function of a, b, c.

Wait, another idea: perhaps to find possible values of Q, given that a, b, c are positive integers summing to 300.

But I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe trying to find when P is positive. Because P = abc = 100Q - 2,000,000.

Since a, b, c are positive integers, P must be positive. So,

100Q - 2,000,000 > 0 → Q > 20,000.

So, Q must be greater than 20,000.

But Q is ab + bc + ac. Let me find the possible range of Q.

We know that Q = ab + bc + ac. For positive integers a, b, c summing to 300, let's see the maximum and minimum possible Q.

The minimum of Q occurs when the variables are as equal as possible. For three variables, the minimum is when a, b, c are as equal as possible. Wait, actually, for ab + bc + ac, the minimum occurs when two variables are as large as possible and the third is as small as possible, but I'm not entirely sure.

Wait, actually, for fixed a + b + c, ab + bc + ac is maximized when the variables are as equal as possible, and minimized when one variable is as large as possible, and the others as small as possible.

Wait, let me test that.

Suppose a + b + c = N. Let's fix N.

Let me consider N=3. Then, the possible triples (a,b,c) are permutations of (1,1,1). Then ab + bc + ac = 3.

If I take (2,1,0), but wait, variables are positive. Hmm, so for positive integers, the minimal Q is achieved when two variables are 1 and the third is N-2.

So, for N=3, the minimal Q would be 1*1 + 1*(3-2) + (3-2)*1 = 1 + 1 + 1 = 3, same as when all are equal.

Wait, maybe my earlier assumption is wrong. Let me take a bigger N.

Take N=4. Then, possible triples:

(2,1,1): ab + bc + ac = 2*1 + 1*1 + 1*2 = 2 +1 +2 =5

(3,1,0): but variables are positive, so (3,1,0) is invalid. So, minimal Q is 5.

But for the triple (2,1,1), Q=5, while if all are equal (4/3, which isn't integer). So, in positive integers, perhaps the minimal Q is achieved when variables are as equal as possible.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Maybe ab + bc + ac is maximized when variables are equal, but minimized when one is as large as possible and others as small as possible.

Wait, let's take N=5.

Triples:

(3,1,1): ab + bc + ac = 3*1 +1*1 +1*3=3 +1 +3=7

(2,2,1): ab + bc + ac =2*2 +2*1 +1*2=4 +2 +2=8

So, in this case, (3,1,1) gives a lower Q than (2,2,1). So, that suggests that Q is minimized when one variable is as large as possible, and the others as small as possible.

So, for N=5, the minimal Q is 7, achieved by (3,1,1) and permutations.

Similarly, for N=6:

(4,1,1): ab + bc + ac=4*1 +1*1 +1*4=4 +1 +4=9

(3,2,1): ab + bc + ac=3*2 +2*1 +1*3=6 +2 +3=11

(2,2,2): ab + bc + ac=2*2 +2*2 +2*2=12

So, again, the minimal Q is achieved by the triple where one variable is as large as possible, and the others are 1.

So, this suggests that for N, the minimal Q is when two variables are 1, and the third is N-2.

So, in our case, N=300. So, minimal Q would be when two variables are 1, and the third is 297.

So, Q_min = 1*1 +1*297 +1*297=1 +297 +297=595.

Wait, that's much lower than 20,000, which is our lower bound for Q from earlier.

Wait, but wait, earlier I found that Q must be greater than 20,000 because P=100Q - 2,000,000 must be positive.

So, if Q_min is 595, which is way less than 20,000, that suggests that Q must be between 20,001 and some maximum value. Hmm.

But wait, earlier, when one variable is zero, we found that Q was 20,000, but in the case when a=0, b=200, c=100, Q=ab + bc + ac=0*200 + 200*100 + 100*0=20,000.

Wait, so in the case when one variable is zero, Q=20,000, and P=abc=0.

But when a, b, c are positive integers, Q must be greater than 20,000.

So, for positive integers, Q must be greater than 20,000.

But is that possible? Let's check.

Wait, let me see: if a, b, c are positive integers, their sum is 300, and Q=ab + bc + ac > 20,000.

But what's the maximum possible Q?

Since ab + bc + ac can be as large as possible when the variables are as unequal as possible, but in the case of positive integers, the maximum Q occurs when two variables are as large as possible, and the third as small as possible.

Wait, no, actually, for ab + bc + ac, the maximum is achieved when the variables are as equal as possible.

Wait, let me test that.

Take N=4.

Triples:

(2,1,1): Q=2*1 +1*1 +1*2=5

(2,2,0): but variables are positive, so (2,2,0) is invalid.

Wait, so in the case of positive integers, for N=4, the maximum Q is 5.

But if I take (3,1,0), which is invalid because of the zero.

So, for positive integers, the maximum Q is when the variables are as equal as possible.

Wait, for N=4, maximum Q is 5 (as in 2,1,1).

Wait, perhaps for positive integers, the maximum Q occurs when the variables are as equal as possible.

Wait, perhaps I can think of ab + bc + ac in terms of (a + b + c)^2.

We know that (a + b + c)^2 = a² + b² + c² + 2(ab + bc + ac)

So, ab + bc + ac = [ (a + b + c)^2 - (a² + b² + c²) ] / 2

So, ab + bc + ac is maximized when a² + b² + c² is minimized.

Which happens when the variables are as equal as possible.

So, for positive integers, the minimal a² + b² + c² occurs when the variables are as equal as possible.

Therefore, Q is maximized when a, b, c are as equal as possible.

So, for N=300, which is divisible by 3, each would be 100. So, in that case, a = b = c = 100.

Then, Q would be 100*100 + 100*100 + 100*100 = 3*10,000 = 30,000.

So, maximum Q is 30,000.

Wait, so Q can vary from 595 (when two variables are 1 and one is 297) up to 30,000 (when all are 100).

But in our case, Q must be greater than 20,000, so Q is in (20,000, 30,000].

So, Q is between 20,001 and 30,000.

But since Q must be an integer, because a, b, c are integers, so Q is integer.

So, with Q in that range.

Now, from earlier, we have P = 100Q - 2,000,000.

Since P must also be a positive integer, as it's the product of a, b, c.

So, P = 100Q - 2,000,000 > 0 → Q > 20,000.

Which we already have.

So, now, for each Q in 20,001 to 30,000, we have P=100Q - 2,000,000.

But we also have the relationship that a, b, c are roots of the cubic equation:

x³ - 300x² + Qx - P = 0

Which is:

x³ - 300x² + Qx - (100Q - 2,000,000) = 0

Simplify:

x³ - 300x² + Qx - 100Q + 2,000,000 = 0

Which can be rewritten as:

x³ - 300x² + Q(x - 100) + 2,000,000 = 0

Hmm, not sure if that helps.

Alternatively, maybe I can factor this cubic equation.

Wait, perhaps x=100 is a root? Let me test.

Plug x=100 into the equation:

100³ - 300*(100)² + Q*(100 - 100) + 2,000,000

= 1,000,000 - 300*10,000 + 0 + 2,000,000

= 1,000,000 - 3,000,000 + 2,000,000

= 0.

So, x=100 is a root.

Therefore, the cubic factors as (x - 100)(x² - 200x + (2,000,000 / 100))?

Wait, no, let's perform polynomial division.

We know that (x - 100) is a factor, so let's perform the division.

Divide x³ - 300x² + Qx - 100Q + 2,000,000 by (x - 100).

Using synthetic division:

Coefficients: 1 | -300 | Q | (-100Q + 2,000,000)

Bring down 1.

Multiply by 100: 1 * 100 = 100.

Add to next coefficient: -300 + 100 = -200.

Multiply by 100: -200 * 100 = -20,000.

Add to next coefficient: Q + (-20,000) = Q - 20,000.

Multiply by 100: (Q - 20,000) * 100 = 100Q - 2,000,000.

Add to last coefficient: (-100Q + 2,000,000) + (100Q - 2,000,000) = 0.

So, the cubic factors as (x - 100)(x² - 200x + (Q - 20,000)).

So, the quadratic factor is x² - 200x + (Q - 20,000).

Therefore, the roots are x=100, and the roots of x² - 200x + (Q - 20,000) = 0.

So, the other two roots are given by the quadratic equation:

x = [200 ± sqrt(200² - 4*(Q - 20,000))]/2

Simplify the discriminant:

D = 40,000 - 4*(Q - 20,000) = 40,000 - 4Q + 80,000 = 120,000 - 4Q.

So, D = 4*(30,000 - Q).

Therefore, the roots are:

x = [200 ± sqrt(4*(30,000 - Q))]/2 = [200 ± 2*sqrt(30,000 - Q)]/2 = 100 ± sqrt(30,000 - Q)

So, the other two roots are 100 + sqrt(30,000 - Q) and 100 - sqrt(30,000 - Q).

Since a, b, c are integers, the square root sqrt(30,000 - Q) must be an integer. Let me denote k = sqrt(30,000 - Q), where k is a nonnegative integer.

Then, 30,000 - Q = k² → Q = 30,000 - k².

Since Q must be greater than 20,000, as established earlier, we have:

30,000 - k² > 20,000 → k² < 10,000 → k < 100.

So, k can be 0,1,2,...,99.

But wait, k must be such that 30,000 - Q is a perfect square, and Q must be an integer as Q = ab + bc + ac.

So, k can range from 0 to 99.

So, for each k in 0 ≤ k ≤ 99, we have Q = 30,000 - k².

Then, the roots are 100 + k and 100 - k.

But wait, the other two roots are 100 + k and 100 - k.

But since a, b, c are positive integers, the roots must be positive integers.

So, 100 - k must be a positive integer. So, 100 - k ≥ 1 → k ≤ 99, which is already satisfied.

So, the three roots are 100, 100 + k, 100 - k.

But wait, 100 - k must be at least 1, so k can be up to 99.

So, for each k from 0 to 99, we have the three roots: 100, 100 + k, 100 - k.

But, wait, the roots must be integers, so k must be an integer.

So, for each integer k from 0 to 99, we can write the triple as (100, 100 + k, 100 - k).

But we need to consider permutations of these triples since a, b, c are ordered.

Wait, but in our case, the cubic equation is giving us the roots, but the variables a, b, c can be in any order. So, each set of roots can be permuted in different ways.

But in our case, the roots are 100, 100 +k, 100 -k. So, when k=0, all three roots are 100, so the triple is (100, 100, 100), which is a single solution.

For k=1 to 99, the roots are 100, 101, 99. So, the triple would be a permutation of (99, 100, 101).

Wait, but the roots are 100, 100 + k, 100 -k.

So, for each k, the set is {100 -k, 100, 100 +k}. So, the three numbers are consecutive integers centered at 100, spaced by k.

But since a, b, c can be arranged in any order, each distinct permutation would be a different triple.

So, for each k from 1 to 99, we have a set of three distinct numbers: 100 -k, 100, 100 +k.

Each of these can be arranged in 3! = 6 ways, unless two numbers are the same.

But since k ≥1, 100 -k ≠ 100 +k, and neither is equal to 100.

So, each k from 1 to 99 gives 6 distinct triples.

But wait, when k=0, we have all three numbers equal to 100, so only one triple.

So, let's count the number of triples in this scenario.

For k=0: 1 triple.

For k=1 to 99: each k gives 6 triples.

So, total number of triples is 1 + 99*6 = 1 + 594 = 595.

But wait, hold on. We need to check if these triples satisfy the original equations.

Because, for each k, the roots are 100 -k, 100, 100 +k, which sum to 300, as required: (100 -k) + 100 + (100 +k) = 300.

And, as per the earlier construction, they should satisfy the second equation.

But let me double-check with k=1.

For k=1, the triple is (99, 100, 101).

Compute a + b + c = 99 + 100 + 101 = 300. Good.

Compute a²b + a²c + b²a + b²c + c²a + c²b.

Let me compute each term:

a²b = 99² * 100 = 9801 * 100 = 980,100

a²c = 99² * 101 = 9801 * 101 = 980,100 + 9801 = 989,901

b²a = 100² * 99 = 10,000 * 99 = 990,000

b²c = 100² * 101 = 10,000 * 101 = 1,010,000

c²a = 101² * 99 = 10,201 * 99 = 1,009,899

c²b = 101² * 100 = 10,201 * 100 = 1,020,100

Now, sum all these:

980,100 + 989,901 = 1,970,001

1,970,001 + 990,000 = 2,960,001

2,960,001 + 1,010,000 = 3,970,001

3,970,001 + 1,009,899 = 4,979,900

4,979,900 + 1,020,100 = 6,000,000.

Yes, it adds up. So, the triple (99, 100, 101) satisfies the second equation.

Similarly, any permutation of this triple would also satisfy the equations because the equation is symmetric in a, b, c.

So, each such triple is valid.

So, moving on, we have 595 triples where all a, b, c are positive integers, meaning none are zero.

Earlier, we found 6 triples where exactly one variable is zero.

So, total number of triples is 595 + 6 = 601.

Wait, but wait a second. Let me check. Earlier, when k=0, we have the triple (100,100,100), which is a single solution. So, that's 1 triple.

Then, for k=1 to 99, each gives 6 triples, so 99*6=594.

Then, the cases where one variable is zero: 6 triples.

So, total is 1 + 594 + 6 = 601.

But hold on, are all these triples distinct?

Because when one variable is zero, the other two are 100 and 200, but in the case of k=100, but wait, k can't be 100 because k ≤ 99.

Wait, when k=100, Q would be 30,000 - (100)^2 = 30,000 - 10,000 = 20,000, but we have k up to 99, so when k=99, Q=30,000 - 99²=30,000 - 9801=20,199.

Wait, but when k=0, we have Q=30,000, which is the maximum Q.

When k=99, Q=30,000 - 99²=30,000 - 9801=20,199.

But earlier, when one variable is zero, we had Q=20,000.

Wait, so the case when one variable is zero is when Q=20,000, which would correspond to k= sqrt(30,000 - Q)=sqrt(10,000)=100.

But since k is up to 99, that case is not included in the previous count.

So, the 6 solutions where one variable is zero are distinct from the 595 solutions where all variables are positive.

Therefore, the total number of triples is 595 +6=601.

Wait, but wait, let me check: when k=100, we would have the roots 0,100,200, but k can't be 100 because k must be ≤99.

So, the 6 solutions where one variable is zero are separate from the 595 solutions.

Thus, the total number of solutions is 595 +6=601.

Wait, but I have a problem here. When k=0, we have the triple (100,100,100). But when one variable is zero, for example, (0, 200,100), which is a different kind of solution.

So, yes, these are distinct.

But wait another thought: when k=0, the triple is (100,100,100). That's a unique solution.

Then, for k=1 to99, we have 594 solutions.

Plus the 6 solutions where one variable is zero.

So, 1 + 594 +6=601.

But let me think again: for the cubic equation, each k from 0 to99 gives a unique set of roots, but when k=0, all roots are the same, so only one triple.

When k=1 to99, each gives a distinct triple, with three distinct numbers, which can be permuted in 6 ways each.

But each of these permutations is a distinct ordered triple.

Similarly, the 6 cases where one variable is zero are also distinct ordered triples.

So, adding them up, we get 601.

But let me confirm if all these ordered triples are unique.

For example, when k=1, the numbers are 99,100,101. Their permutations are 6 different ordered triples.

Similarly, for k=2, numbers are 98,100,102, also 6 permutations.

And so on, up to k=99, numbers 1,100,199, 6 permutations.

Plus the 6 cases where one variable is zero: (0,100,200), (0,200,100), (100,0,200), (200,0,100), (100,200,0), (200,100,0).

And the case where all are 100: (100,100,100).

So, no overlap between these sets.

Therefore, 601 is the total number.

Wait, but wait another thing: in our earlier calculation, the case when k=0, triple is (100,100,100). But in the quadratic equation, when k=0, the roots are 100,100,100.

But in reality, when k=0, the quadratic equation x² -200x + (Q -20,000)=x² -200x + (30,000 -0 -20,000)=x² -200x +10,000=0.

Wait, solving x² -200x +10,000=0.

Discriminant D=40,000 -40,000=0.

So, double root at x=100. So, the triple is (100,100,100). So, that's correct.

So, all cases accounted for.

Thus, the total number of triples is 601.

But wait, let me think about another possible case. Are there any other solutions when two variables are equal, but not covered by the above cases?

Wait, for example, suppose two variables are equal, say a = b, but c is different.

Would that lead to any additional solutions?

Wait, let me see.

Suppose a = b, then the equations become:

2a + c = 300 → c = 300 - 2a

And the second equation:

a²a + a²c + a²a + a²c + c²a + c²a = 2a³ + 2a²c + 2c²a.

Wait, no, wait: the second equation is a²b + a²c + b²a + b²c + c²a + c²b.

Since a = b, it becomes a²a + a²c + a²a + a²c + c²a + c²a.

Which is 2a³ + 2a²c + 2c²a.

Factor out 2a:

2a(a² + a c + c²)

But c = 300 - 2a.

So, substitute c:

2a [ a² + a(300 - 2a) + (300 - 2a)² ]

Compute term by term:

a² + a(300 - 2a) + (300 - 2a)² = a² + 300a - 2a² + (90,000 - 1200a + 4a²)

Simplify:

a² +300a -2a² +90,000 -1200a +4a² = (1 -2 +4)a² + (300 -1200)a +90,000

= 3a² -900a +90,000

So, the second equation becomes:

2a (3a² -900a +90,000) = 6,000,000

Divide both sides by 2a (assuming a ≠0):

3a² -900a +90,000 = 3,000,000 /a

Multiply both sides by a:

3a³ -900a² +90,000a = 3,000,000

Divide both sides by 3:

a³ - 300a² +30,000a -1,000,000 =0

Hmm, solving this cubic equation for integer a.

Let me try to find integer roots.

Possible rational roots are factors of 1,000,000 divided by factors of 1.

So, possible roots are ±1, ±2, ..., ±1,000,000.

Testing a=100:

100³ -300*(100)^2 +30,000*100 -1,000,000=1,000,000 -3,000,000 +3,000,000 -1,000,000=0.

So, a=100 is a root.

Factor the cubic as (a -100)(a² -200a +10,000)=0.

Set a² -200a +10,000=0.

Discriminant: 40,000 -40,000=0.

So, double root at a=100.

So, the only solution is a=100, which leads to c=300 -2*100=100.

So, the triple is (100,100,100), which is already accounted for in our earlier count.

So, no new solutions here.

Thus, there are no additional solutions where two variables are equal beyond what we've already considered.

Therefore, the total number of triples is 601.

Wait, but earlier, when I considered k=0, which gives (100,100,100), that's one solution.

Then, for k=1 to99, 594 solutions.

Plus the 6 solutions where one variable is zero.

Thus, 1 +594 +6=601.

But wait, wait. Let me recount.

For the case where all variables are positive, we have:

- For k=0: 1 solution.

- For k=1 to99: 99 values, each giving 6 ordered triples: 99*6=594.

So, 1 +594=595.

Plus, the 6 solutions where one variable is zero.

Total: 595 +6=601.

Yes, that's correct.

So, the answer is 601.

But wait, wait another moment.

Wait, in the case where one variable is zero, let me check if those 6 solutions have Q=20,000.

Earlier, when a=0, we had Q=ab + bc + ac=0 +200*100 +0=20,000.

So, for these solutions, Q=20,000.

But in our earlier analysis, when k=100, which is beyond our allowed k (0 to99), we would have Q=30,000 -100²=30,000 -10,000=20,000.

But since k is limited to 0 to99, these cases are not included in the 595 solutions. So, the 6 solutions are separate.

Thus, 595 +6=601.

But now I'm concerned that in our cubic equation approach, we might have missed these 6 solutions, because when k=100, it's outside our range.

Therefore, in our count, we have:

- 1 solution with all variables 100.

- 594 solutions with variables arranged as (100 -k,100,100 +k) for k=1 to99.

- 6 solutions with one variable zero, others 200 and 100.

So, total 601.

Thus, the answer should be 601.

But wait, wait a second: in the case when k=100, which is beyond our limit, but in that case, the variables would be 0,100,200.

Which is exactly the case where one variable is zero, which we've already accounted for.

Therefore, all cases are covered.

Thus, the total number is 601.

But the problem says "nonnegative integers," so including zero is allowed.

Thus, the final answer is 601.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To solve the problem, we analyze the given equations \(a + b + c = 300\) and \(a^2b + a^2c + b^2a + b^2c + c^2a + c^2b = 6,000,000\). 

First, we rewrite the second equation as:
\[
a^2(b + c) + b^2(a + c) + c^2(a + b) = 6,000,000
\]
Using \(a + b + c = 300\), we substitute \(b + c = 300 - a\), \(a + c = 300 - b\), and \(a + b = 300 - c\) into the equation:
\[
a^2(300 - a) + b^2(300 - b) + c^2(300 - c) = 6,000,000
\]
Expanding and simplifying, we find:
\[
300(a^2 + b^2 + c^2) - (a^3 + b^3 + c^3) = 6,000,000
\]
Using the identity \((a + b + c)^2 = a^2 + b^2 + c^2 + 2(ab + bc + ac)\), we express \(a^2 + b^2 + c^2\) in terms of \(ab + bc + ac\) and substitute back. After several algebraic manipulations, we find that the problem reduces to solving for \(a, b, c\) such that:
\[
a^3 + b^3 + c^3 = 21,000,000 - 600Q
\]
where \(Q = ab + bc + ac\). Further analysis reveals that \(Q\) must be greater than 20,000, leading to the conclusion that \(a, b, c\) must satisfy specific quadratic and cubic relationships.

By considering cases where one variable is zero and where all variables are positive, we find that the total number of valid triples is:
\[
\boxed{601}
