Okay, so I've got this math problem here about residents in Aimeville and the things they own. Let me read it again and try to make sense of it.

The problem says there are 900 residents. Out of these, some own a diamond ring, some own a set of golf clubs, some own a garden spade, and every single one owns a bag of candy hearts. So, four items in total: diamond ring (let's call this D), golf clubs (G), garden spade (S), and candy hearts (C). Every resident owns at least the candy hearts, so C is owned by everyone.

The numbers given are:
- 195 own a diamond ring (D)
- 367 own a set of golf clubs (G)
- 562 own a garden spade (S)
- Each owns a bag of candy hearts (C), so C is 900.

Additionally, it's mentioned that 437 residents own exactly two of these things, and 234 own exactly three of them. We need to find how many own all four: D, G, S, and C.

Hmm, okay. I remember something about inclusion-exclusion principles from set theory. Since we're dealing with overlaps between sets, that's probably the way to go here.

Inclusion-exclusion for four sets can get a bit complicated, but maybe there's a formula or a way to approach it step by step. Let me recall.

The basic inclusion-exclusion principle for four sets is:

|D ∪ G ∪ S ∪ C| = |D| + |G| + |S| + |C| - |D∩G| - |D∩S| - |D∩C| - |G∩S| - |G∩C| - |S∩C| + |D∩G∩S| + |D∩G∩C| + |D∩S∩C| + |G∩S∩C| - |D∩G∩S∩C|

But wait, in this problem, we don't know any of these pairwise or triple overlaps directly. Instead, we have information about how many people own exactly two or exactly three things. Maybe we can use that.

Wait, but the total number of residents is 900, and everyone owns at least C, the candy hearts. So, the union of all four sets is 900. So, |D ∪ G ∪ S ∪ C| = 900.

Alternatively, since C is owned by everyone, the union is just 900, which makes sense.

But how does that help me? Let's think about the exact numbers.

I know that the number of people owning exactly two things is 437, and exactly three things is 234. We need to find the number who own all four. Let me denote the number who own all four as x.

I remember that in inclusion-exclusion, the counts for exactly two and exactly three can be related to the intersections.

Wait, maybe another approach: the principle of inclusion-exclusion can also be used with the concept of exactly k elements.

The formula for exactly three is a bit involved, but perhaps using the principle that:

Total = only D + only G + only S + only C + exactly two + exactly three + exactly four.

Wait, but in our case, C is owned by everyone, so "only C" is zero, because everyone owns C. So, if someone owns exactly one thing, it must be C. But the problem doesn't mention how many own exactly one thing. Hmm, but maybe we can figure that out.

Wait, the problem says each of the 900 residents owns a bag of candy hearts. So, candy hearts are a must. So, the only way someone could own exactly one thing is if they own only C. But the problem doesn't state how many own exactly one thing, so perhaps we can denote that as y.

But the problem gives us the numbers for exactly two (437) and exactly three (234). We need to find exactly four, which is x.

So, total residents can be broken down as:

Total = only C + exactly two + exactly three + exactly four.

So, 900 = y + 437 + 234 + x.

Wait, but we don't know y (the number of people who own only C). Hmm, so that's four variables: y, exactly two (437), exactly three (234), and exactly four (x). But 900 = y + 437 + 234 + x.

Wait, but that's one equation with two unknowns. Hmm, perhaps I need another equation.

Alternatively, considering the inclusion-exclusion formula but using the counts for exactly two and exactly three.

Wait, another approach: using the inclusion-exclusion for exactly two.

Wait, the number of people owning exactly two items can be calculated as the sum of all pairwise intersections minus three times those who own exactly three, minus the triple overlaps... Hmm, I'm getting a bit confused.

Wait, maybe I should look at the inclusion-exclusion formula for four sets and relate it to the exact overlaps.

Alternatively, I remember that for four sets, the number of elements in exactly two sets is equal to the sum of all pairwise intersections minus three times those in exactly three sets minus four times those in all four sets. Wait, I'm not sure.

Let me think. Let me denote:

a = number of people who own exactly two things.

b = number who own exactly three.

c = number who own all four.

So, a = 437, b = 234, c = x.

We can also note that the total number of people is: only C (y) + exactly two (a) + exactly three (b) + exactly four (c) = 900.

So, 900 = y + 437 + 234 + x.

But I don't know y. So, let's see if we can find another equation.

Alternatively, let's think about the counts for each set:

Each set's count is the number of people who own exactly that item, plus those who own that item and exactly one other, plus those who own that item and exactly two others, etc.

Wait, but with four items, it's a bit complicated.

Wait, wait. Wait, since C is owned by everyone, the counts for D, G, S are subsets of the entire population. So, the number owning D is 195, which includes those who own only D, those who own D and another item, etc., up to those who own all four.

Similarly for G (367) and S (562).

Let me denote:

n(D) = 195

n(G) = 367

n(S) = 562

n(C) = 900

We can express each of these using inclusion-exclusion as well.

For example, n(D) = number of people who own only D + those who own D and exactly one other item + those who own D and exactly two others + those who own all four.

But since C is always owned, the "exactly one other" could be with C, but since C is already included, maybe it's better to think in terms of the other items.

Wait, but each person owns at least C. So, for n(D), the 195 includes all the people who own D and any combination including C. So, n(D) is the number of people who own D, which includes:

- Those who own only D and C.

- Those who own D and another item (but not all four).

Wait, but since everyone owns C, no one owns only D. Because if someone owns D, they must also own C. So, the only possibilities for owning D are:

- D and C only: exactly two.

- D and another item plus C: so, D, G, and C; D, S, and C.

- D, G, S, and C: all four.

Similarly for G and S.

So, perhaps the count for each set can be broken down.

Wait, but maybe a better approach is to use the inclusion-exclusion formula.

Wait, the inclusion-exclusion for four sets is:

|D ∪ G ∪ S ∪ C| = |D| + |G| + |S| + |C| - |D∩G| - |D∩S| - |D∩C| - |G∩S| - |G∩C| - |S∩C| + |D∩G∩S| + |D∩G∩C| + |D∩S∩C| + |G∩S∩C| - |D∩G∩S∩C|

But in our case, |D ∪ G ∪ S ∪ C| = 900, since everyone owns at least C.

So,

900 = |D| + |G| + |S| + |C| - [sum of all pairwise intersections] + [sum of all triple intersections] - |D∩G∩S∩C|

But we don't know the pairwise intersections, triple intersections, or the four-way intersection.

So, perhaps that's too many variables to handle. Maybe we can find expressions for the pairwise and triple intersections in terms of a, b, and c (the exactly two, exactly three, and exactly four).

Alternatively, remember that the number of people owning exactly two items is 437. Each pair of sets contributes to this exactly two count. So, the number of people owning exactly D and G is part of the 437, as is exactly D and S, exactly G and S, exactly D and C, exactly G and C, exactly S and C.

Wait, but since everyone owns C, the pair C with any other set would actually include C and that set. So, the number of people owning exactly D and C would be part of the exactly two group, same for G and C, S and C.

But in our problem, the 437 is the number of people owning exactly two of the four things. So, since C is one of the four, it's possible that some of those exactly two are C plus another item.

Wait, but in reality, since everyone owns C, the only way someone can own exactly two is if they own C plus one of D, G, or S.

Wait, no. Because if a person owns exactly two, they have to own two things. Since C is always owned, they must own C and exactly one other thing.

Wait, that's an important point. So, the exactly two group is composed of people who own C and exactly one other item (D, G, or S). Because if you own two things and C is one, the other must be one of D, G, or S. So, no one can own exactly two without C because everyone owns C.

Therefore, the 437 people who own exactly two things are exactly those who own C and one other item. So, the number of people owning exactly C and D is a part of this, as is C and G, and C and S.

So, let me define:

a = number of people owning exactly C and D.

b = exactly C and G.

c = exactly C and S.

Then, a + b + c = 437.

Similarly, the number of people owning exactly three things is 234. Since everyone owns C, these are the people who own C plus exactly two other items.

So, the exactly three group is made up of people who own C and two of D, G, S. Let me denote:

d = exactly C, D, G.

e = exactly C, D, S.

f = exactly C, G, S.

Then, d + e + f = 234.

And the exactly four group is those who own all four, which is x = exactly C, D, G, S.

So, now, we can write equations based on the counts for D, G, S.

For D: the total number of people owning D is 195. These are the people who own:

- Exactly D and C: a

- Exactly D, C, and G: d

- Exactly D, C, and S: e

- All four: x

So, n(D) = a + d + e + x = 195.

Similarly, for G:

n(G) = b + d + f + x = 367.

For S:

n(S) = c + e + f + x = 562.

And for C, since everyone owns C, that's 900, but we don't need to write that.

So, summarizing the equations:

1. a + b + c = 437 (exactly two things, each pair with C)
2. d + e + f = 234 (exactly three things, each trio with C)
3. a + d + e + x = 195 (n(D))
4. b + d + f + x = 367 (n(G))
5. c + e + f + x = 562 (n(S))
6. x is the number we need to find.

So, that's six equations, but with variables a, b, c, d, e, f, x.

Wait, but we have seven variables and six equations. So, maybe another equation is needed. But I think we can express the equations in terms of each other.

Let me see. Let me try to subtract some equations to eliminate variables.

First, let me add equations 3, 4, and 5.

Equation3 + Equation4 + Equation5:

(a + d + e + x) + (b + d + f + x) + (c + e + f + x) ) = 195 + 367 + 562

Simplify the left side:

a + b + c + 2d + 2e + 2f + 3x.

Right side: 195 + 367 = 562; 562 + 562 = 1124.

So, 1124 = a + b + c + 2d + 2e + 2f + 3x.

We know from equation1 that a + b + c = 437.

From equation2, d + e + f = 234.

So, substituting those into the equation:

1124 = 437 + 2*(d + e + f) + 3x.

We can plug in d + e + f = 234:

1124 = 437 + 2*234 + 3x.

Calculate:

2*234 = 468.

437 + 468 = 905.

So, 1124 = 905 + 3x.

Subtract 905:

1124 - 905 = 219 = 3x.

Therefore, x = 219 / 3 = 73.

So, x is 73. So, 73 residents own all four things.

Wait, that seems straightforward. Let me double-check.

So, the steps were:

1. Recognize that exactly two owners are C paired with D, G, or S.

2. Similarly, exactly three owners are C plus two of the other three.

3. The total for each of D, G, S includes their exact two, exact three, and exact four.

4. Adding equations 3,4,5 gives a combined equation which can be expressed in terms of a + b + c, d + e + f, and x.

5. Substituting the known values from a + b + c and d + e + f, we solve for x.

Yes, that makes sense. Therefore, the number of residents who own all four is 73.

To solve the problem, we use the principle of inclusion-exclusion and break down the given data into counts of residents owning exactly two, exactly three, and all four items. Let’s denote:

- \( x \) as the number of residents who own all four items (D, G, S, C).
- \( a + b + c = 437 \) as the number of residents owning exactly two items (C paired with D, G, or S).
- \( d + e + f = 234 \) as the number of residents owning exactly three items (C plus two others).

Using the counts for each item:

1. \( a + d + e + x = 195 \) (for D)
2. \( b + d + f + x = 367 \) (for G)
3. \( c + e + f + x = 562 \) (for S)

Adding these equations:

\[
(a + d + e + x) + (b + d + f + x) + (c + e + f + x) = 195 + 367 + 562
\]

Simplifying:

\[
a + b + c + 2d + 2e + 2f + 3x = 1124
\]

Substituting \( a + b + c = 437 \) and \( d + e + f = 234 \):

\[
437 + 2(234) + 3x = 1124
\]

\[
437 + 468 + 3x = 1124
\]

\[
905 + 3x = 1124
\]

\[
3x = 219 \implies x = 73
\]

Thus, the number of residents who own all four items is \(\boxed{73}\).
