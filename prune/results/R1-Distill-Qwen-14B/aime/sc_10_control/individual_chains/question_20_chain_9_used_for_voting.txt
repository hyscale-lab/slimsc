Okay, so I've got this problem here where I need to place some chips on a 5x5 grid. There are 25 white chips and 25 black chips, but they're indistinguishable. The rules are that each cell can have at most one chip, all chips in the same row must be the same color, all chips in the same column must be the same color, and any additional chip placed would violate these conditions. I need to find the number of ways to do this.

Hmm, let's break this down. First, each row has to have chips of the same color, and each column as well. So, for each row, I can choose either white or black, and same for each column. But wait, no, actually, because the row and column constraints have to be consistent. If I just choose for each row, then the columns might end up having conflicting colors.

Wait, maybe it's better to think in terms of each row and each column being monochromatic. So each row is either all white, all black, or some other color, but in this case, since the chips are either white or black, each row must be either all white or all black. Similarly for each column.

But wait, no, the problem says "all chips in the same row and all chips in the same column have the same color." So, each row must consist of all white or all black chips, and each column must consist of all white or all black chips. But the problem is that the grid has to satisfy both conditions. So, the color assignments for rows and columns must agree where they intersect.

Wait, that's a good point. For example, if row 1 is white, and column 1 is black, then the cell at (1,1) would have to be both white and black, which is impossible, so that's a conflict. So, the color assignments for the rows and columns must be consistent across the entire grid.

So, perhaps each cell (i,j) must be colored according to both row i and column j. So, for row i, if it's white, then all cells in that row must be white, but if column j is black, all cells in that column must be black. So, the only way these can coexist is if the cells where a white row and a black column intersect don't have any chips. Wait, no. Because each cell can have at most one chip, but the color is determined by both the row and column. So, if row i is white and column j is black, then the cell (i,j) can't have a chip, because it can't be both white and black.

So, in other words, the grid must be such that the coloring is a combination of some rows white and some rows black, and some columns white and some black, such that where a white row and a black column intersect, there's no chip. But wait, the problem says each cell can have at most one chip, but the coloring is determined by the rows and columns. Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating.

Alternatively, maybe the grid must be divided into four regions: rows that are white, rows that are black, columns that are white, and columns that are black. The intersection of a white row and a white column can have a white chip, the intersection of a black row and a black column can have a black chip, and the intersections of white and black rows/columns can't have any chips. Because those intersections would require the chip to be both white and black, which is impossible.

Wait, that makes sense. So, the grid can be partitioned into four blocks:

1. Top-left: rows assigned white, columns assigned white.
2. Top-right: rows assigned white, columns assigned black.
3. Bottom-left: rows assigned black, columns assigned white.
4. Bottom-right: rows assigned black, columns assigned black.

In the top-right and bottom-left blocks, there can't be any chips because the rows and columns there are conflicting colors. But in the top-left, which is white rows and white columns, those cells can have white chips. Similarly, the bottom-right can have black chips.

So, in this setup, the number of white chips is the number of cells in the top-left block, and the number of black chips is the number in the bottom-right block.

But wait, the problem states that we have 25 white and 25 black chips. So, the total number of white and black chips is 50, which is exactly the number of cells in the grid. So, in this case, the top-left and bottom-right blocks together must cover all 25 cells, and the top-right and bottom-left blocks must have 0 cells. Wait, no. Because the grid is 5x5, so each partition is a rectangle.

Wait, perhaps the grid is split into four rectangles by selecting some rows to be white and others black, and some columns to be white and others black. So, if I have r white rows and (5 - r) black rows, and c white columns and (5 - c) black columns, then the top-left block is r x c, the top-right is r x (5 - c), the bottom-left is (5 - r) x c, and the bottom-right is (5 - r) x (5 - c). 

In the top-left, we can place white chips, so the number of white chips is r*c. In the bottom-right, we can place black chips, so the number of black chips is (5 - r)*(5 - c). The top-right and bottom-left can't have any chips because of the color conflict.

But wait, the problem states that all the cells in the grid must have at most one chip, but it's not required to have a chip in every cell. So, the number of white chips can be any number up to r*c, and similarly for black chips. But in our problem, we have exactly 25 white and 25 black chips. So, we must have r*c = 25 and (5 - r)*(5 - c) = 25.

So, we have two equations:

1. r * c = 25
2. (5 - r) * (5 - c) = 25

Hmm, so we need to find integers r and c between 0 and 5 (since we can't have more than 5 rows or columns) such that both equations are satisfied.

Let me try plugging in possible values for r and c.

First, 25 factors. Since 25 is 5x5, but r and c are up to 5.

So, possible pairs (r, c) that satisfy r*c =25:

- (1,25): but c can't be 25 since maximum is 5. So invalid.
- (5,5): 5*5=25. So that's a possibility.
- (25,1): same issue, too big.
Wait, actually, 25 is 5^2, so the only possible factors within 0-5 are (5,5). Because 25 is too big for r or c, which can't exceed 5.

Wait, but 25 is 5*5, so r=5, c=5 is the only possible solution for r*c=25 within r,c <=5.

Wait, but let's check if (5,5) also satisfies the second equation: (5 -5)*(5 -5) = 0*0=0, which is not 25. So that's a problem. So that means (5,5) is not a solution.

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake. Let's think again. Maybe the equations are correct? Or perhaps I'm approaching this wrong.

Wait, if the top-left block is r rows and c columns, then the number of white chips is r*c, as those are the cells where white rows and white columns intersect. Similarly, the bottom-right is (5 - r)x(5 - c) which is (5 - r)*(5 - c) cells, each of which can have a black chip. So, the total white chips would be r*c, and the total black chips would be (5 - r)*(5 - c). Since we have 25 white and 25 black, we have:

r*c = 25

and

(5 - r)*(5 - c) =25.

So both equations must hold. So substituting the possible r and c.

We know that r and c are integers between 0 and 5.

Looking for integers r, c in [0,5] such that r*c =25 and (5 - r)(5 -c)=25.

The possible pairs where r*c=25 with r,c <=5: only (5,5) because 5*5=25, but then (5 -5)*(5 -5)=0, which doesn't satisfy the second equation. So no solution in that case.

Wait, that can't be right. Maybe I made a wrong assumption in the setup.

Wait, perhaps the initial approach is incorrect. Maybe the grid doesn't have to have all cells filled, but the sum of white and black is exactly 25 each. But in that case, the equations would be:

r*c =25 (white)

and (5 - r)*(5 - c)=25 (black)

So, adding those together, we get:

r*c + (5 - r)*(5 - c) =50

Which is correct because 25 +25=50.

But the product terms:

r*c + (5 - r)*(5 - c) = r*c + 25 -5r -5c + r*c = 2r*c -5r -5c +25 =50

So,

2r*c -5r -5c +25 =50

Simplify:

2r*c -5r -5c =25

Hmm, perhaps factor out:

Let me think. Maybe factor this equation differently.

Alternatively, let's denote a = r, b =c.

So,

2ab -5a -5b =25

We can rearrange:

2ab -5a -5b =25

Let me add 25/2 to both sides to complete the rectangle or something. Hmm, perhaps not the best approach.

Alternatively, let's factor:

2ab -5a -5b =25

Multiply both sides by 2 to make it easier:

4ab -10a -10b =50

Now, add 25 to both sides:

4ab -10a -10b +25 =75

Then,

(2a -5)(2b -5)=75

Because expanding (2a -5)(2b -5) gives 4ab -10a -10b +25.

So, we have (2a -5)(2b -5)=75.

So, now, since a and b are integers between 0 and5, 2a-5 and 2b-5 must be integers.

Possible factors of 75:

75 can be factored as:

1*75, 3*25, 5*15, 15*5,25*3,75*1, (-1)*(-75), etc.

But since 2a -5 and 2b -5 must be integers, and a and b are between 0 and5, let's find possible values.

Compute 2a -5 where a is 0 to5:

a=0: -5

a=1: -3

a=2: -1

a=3:1

a=4:3

a=5:5

Similarly for b.

So possible values for (2a -5) and (2b -5) are in {-5, -3, -1, 1,3,5}.

We need two factors of 75 where each factor is in {-5,-3,-1,1,3,5}.

So, 75 can be written as:

75=1*75, 3*25, 5*15, but 75 and 25 and 15 are beyond the possible values.

Alternatively, negative factors:

75= (-1)*(-75), (-3)*(-25), (-5)*(-15). Again, these are beyond the possible values.

Wait, but 75 can be expressed as 5*15, but 15 is too big. Alternatively, 3*25, same issue.

Wait, perhaps 75 can be expressed as 5*15, but 15 is too big for our possible factors. So, perhaps considering all possible pairs:

Looking for two numbers x and y in {-5,-3,-1,1,3,5} such that x*y=75.

Looking through the possible pairs:

5 * 15=75 → 15 not possible.

3 *25=75 → 25 not possible.

Similarly, negatives: (-5)*(-15)=75, but same problem.

Wait, maybe 75 can be expressed as something else. Wait, 75 is 25*3, but again, 25 is too big.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the factoring.

Wait, 75 is 25*3, 15*5, 75*1, etc. But none of these factor pairs lie within our possible x and y values.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the equation.

Wait, let me retrace the steps:

We had 2ab -5a -5b =25.

Multiply by 2: 4ab -10a -10b =50.

Then add 25: 4ab -10a -10b +25=75.

Which factors as (2a -5)(2b -5)=75.

So that part is correct.

So, perhaps there are no solutions where x and y are within {-5,-3,-1,1,3,5}.

Which would imply that there are no possible r and c that satisfy the conditions. But that can't be right because the problem states that we can place some chips, so there must be a solution.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing something. Maybe the grid can have all the white chips in some rows and all the black chips in other rows, but then the columns must also align. Wait, maybe the grid is entirely white or entirely black, but that can't be because then the other color would have zero chips, which is not 25.

Alternatively, perhaps all the white chips are in some rows and the black in others, but the columns are all white or all black. But that would require that the white rows and white columns are entirely white, but then the black columns would conflict with white rows, meaning that cells where white rows and black columns intersect can't have chips, which would mean that all black chips are in black rows and black columns, which would require that the black rows and columns don't overlap with white rows and columns except in such a way that all black chips are placed without conflict.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think differently.

Suppose that all the white chips are placed in some subset of rows, and all the black chips are placed in the remaining rows. Similarly, all the white columns can only have white chips, and the black columns can only have black chips.

But for a black column, the rows that have black chips must be the same for all black columns. Otherwise, if a black column has a chip in row i and another in row j, but row i is white, that would be a conflict.

Wait, perhaps the only way to satisfy both row and column constraints is if the white and black regions are rectangles that don't overlap. So, for example, some rows are entirely white, and the remaining rows are entirely black. Similarly, some columns are entirely white, others entirely black. Then, the intersection of white rows and white columns can have white chips, the intersection of black rows and black columns can have black chips, and the other intersections can't have any chips.

In this case, the number of white chips would be the number of white rows times the number of white columns (r * c), and the number of black chips would be (5 - r) * (5 - c). Since we have exactly 25 white and 25 black, we have:

r*c =25

(5 - r)*(5 - c)=25

So, same as before. So, we need to find r and c such that both equations hold.

Wait, but earlier I thought that the only possible solution is (5,5), but that doesn't satisfy the second equation. So perhaps there's no solution, but that can't be because the problem states that such a placement exists.

Wait, maybe I'm making a mistake in assuming that all the white rows and white columns must form a rectangle. Alternatively, perhaps the white and black rows and columns can be arranged in a way that allows for the required number of chips.

Wait, perhaps not all white rows are together. Maybe some rows are white and some are black, and similarly for columns, but arranged such that the white rows and white columns intersect to give 25 white chips, and black rows and columns intersect to give 25 black chips.

Wait, but given that the grid is 5x5, and 5*5=25, perhaps the only way is to have all rows and all columns be either white or black, but arranged such that the white and black regions are each 5x5 grids, but that would require the entire grid to be white or black, which isn't possible because we need both colors.

Wait, perhaps the solution is that all white rows and all black rows are arranged such that the white rows are the first k rows and the black rows are the last (5 -k) rows. Similarly, the white columns are the first m columns and the black columns are the last (5 -m) columns. Then, the white region is k x m, and the black region is (5 -k) x (5 -m). So, k*m=25 and (5 -k)*(5 -m)=25.

So, solving for k and m.

Let me try k=5, m=5: 5*5=25, but then (5-5)*(5-5)=0, which doesn't give 25. So that's no good.

What about k=5, m=5: same issue.

Wait, perhaps k=5 and m=5 is the only possibility for the first equation, but it fails the second. So perhaps there's no solution, but that's impossible because the problem says such a placement exists.

Wait, maybe I'm missing something. Let's try k=1, m=25: but m can't be 25, as it's a 5x5 grid.

Wait, maybe k=5, m=5 isn't possible, but perhaps other combinations? Like k=5, m=5 is the only way to get 25, but that doesn't help.

Alternatively, maybe I'm approaching this wrong. Perhaps the grid can have some rows all white, others all black, and similarly for columns, but the intersection of a white row and a black column can't have a chip, but the rest can.

Wait, but then the number of white chips would be the sum over white rows of the number of white columns they intersect, but that's not necessarily a rectangle. Wait, no, because each row is either all white or all black, and each column is either all white or all black. So, the white cells are the intersection of white rows and white columns, which forms a rectangle. Similarly for black cells.

So, the grid must be divided into four rectangles:

- White rows and white columns: white chips.
- Black rows and black columns: black chips.
- White rows and black columns: no chips.
- Black rows and white columns: no chips.

So, the number of white chips is r * c, where r is the number of white rows and c is the number of white columns. The number of black chips is (5 - r) * (5 - c). So, we have:

r * c =25

(5 - r) * (5 - c) =25

So, solving these equations.

We can set up the equations:

Equation 1: r*c =25

Equation 2: (5 -r)(5 -c)=25

Let me expand equation 2:

(5 - r)(5 -c) =25

25 -5r -5c + r*c =25

Subtract 25 from both sides:

-5r -5c + r*c =0

But from equation 1, r*c=25, so substitute:

-5r -5c +25=0

So,

-5r -5c = -25

Divide both sides by -5:

r + c =5

So, we have:

r + c=5

and

r*c=25

So, we can solve for r and c.

Let me write down the possible integer solutions where r and c are integers between 0 and5.

We have r + c=5 and r*c=25.

The possible pairs (r,c) that add up to 5 are:

(0,5), (1,4), (2,3), (3,2), (4,1), (5,0)

Now, check which of these pairs also satisfy r*c=25.

(0,5): 0*5=0≠25 → Not solution.

(1,4):1*4=4≠25→No.

(2,3):2*3=6≠25→No.

(3,2):3*2=6≠25→No.

(4,1):4*1=4≠25→No.

(5,0):5*0=0≠25→No.

Hmm, none of these pairs satisfy both equations. So, that suggests that there's no solution, but that can't be right because the problem says that such a placement exists.

Wait a minute, perhaps I made a mistake in the setup. Let me think again.

Wait, when I set up the equations, I assumed that all white chips are in the white rows and white columns, and all black chips are in black rows and black columns. But perhaps the problem allows for some rows to be all white and others all black, and some columns all white and others all black, but in a way that the white and black regions overlap. But wait, that would cause conflicts because a cell in a white row and black column can't have a chip.

Wait, but perhaps the problem allows for some rows and columns to be all white, others all black, but the placement of chips is such that only the intersections of same-colored rows and columns have chips. So, the white chips are placed in the intersections of white rows and white columns, and black chips in the intersections of black rows and black columns.

But then, as per the earlier equations, we end up with r +c=5 and r*c=25, which has no solution. So, perhaps the only way is if r +c=5 and r*c=25, which is impossible with integers. So, maybe the problem allows for some rows to be white and some to be black, but not all, or perhaps some rows or columns can be mixed. Wait, no, the problem states that all chips in the same row must be the same color, and all chips in the same column must be the same color. So, each row must be all white or all black, and each column must be all white or all black.

Wait, perhaps the only way is to have all the white rows and white columns arranged such that their intersection is a 5x5 grid, but that's impossible because then the black region would be zero.

Wait, perhaps the problem allows for some rows to be white and some columns to be black, but the placement of the chips is such that the white region is 25 and the black region is 25. But that would require the white and black regions to each occupy exactly half the grid, but in a 5x5 grid, which has 25 cells, that's not possible unless the regions are arranged in a way that allows for 25 each, but the grid only has 25 cells. So, that's impossible.

Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me try to think differently.

Wait, perhaps the problem allows for some rows to be white and others black, and similarly for columns, but the grid is divided in such a way that the white and black regions each have 25 cells, but arranged in a way that doesn't require them to be rectangles.

But no, because each row and each column must be all white or all black, which implies that the white and black regions must form rectangles. So, it's impossible to have 25 white and 25 black cells in a 5x5 grid with this constraint because the total cells are 25, not 50. So, perhaps the problem is to place exactly 25 chips in total, 25 in white and 25 in black, but that can't be because each cell can have at most one chip.

Wait, the problem says "all chips in the same row and all chips in the same column have the same colour." So, perhaps the grid can have some cells with white chips and some with black, but arranged such that each row is all white or all black, and each column is all white or all black.

Wait, perhaps the number of white and black chips can vary as long as each row and column is uniform. But the problem states that we have exactly 25 white and 25 black chips. So, 50 chips in total, but the grid has only 25 cells. So, that's impossible. Wait, no, the problem says "some of these chips", so perhaps we're placing some chips, not necessarily all.

Wait, the problem says: "Find the number of ways to place some of these chips... such that each cell contains at most one chip... any additional chip placed would violate one or more of the previous two conditions."

Wait, so the placement must be maximal, meaning that you can't add any more chips without violating the row and column color constraints. So, the grid will have some cells with chips, either white or black, and the remaining cells cannot have any chips because adding a chip there would require that row or column to change color, which is not allowed.

So, in this case, the number of white and black chips can be any number, but in our case, the problem says that "some of these chips" are placed, but the exact count isn't specified beyond the conditions. Wait, no, the problem says "25 indistinguishable white chips and 25 indistinguishable black chips." So, we have 25 white and 25 black chips to place on the grid, but the grid is 5x5, so 25 cells. So, each cell can have at most one chip, but since we have 50 chips, that's impossible unless some cells have multiple chips, but the problem states "each cell contains at most one chip."

Wait, this is impossible. There must be a misunderstanding. Wait, the problem says "some of these chips," so perhaps we don't have to use all 50 chips. Wait, but it says "25 indistinguishable white chips and 25 indistinguishable black chips." So, perhaps the total number of chips placed is up to 25, but that's not clear.

Wait, perhaps the problem allows for any number of chips, up to 25, but the problem says "some of these chips," so perhaps we're to place any number, but with the constraints that each row and column is uniform in color, and that the placement is maximal, meaning you can't add any more without violating the constraints.

Wait, but the problem also states that "any additional chip placed on the grid would violate one or more of the previous two conditions." So, the placement is maximal. So, given that, the number of white and black chips placed must be such that no more can be added without changing the color of a row or column.

So, perhaps the grid is colored in such a way that some rows are white, others black, and same for columns, and the number of white and black chips placed is determined by the intersection of white rows and columns, etc.

Wait, perhaps the grid can have some white rows and some black rows, and some white columns and some black columns, but the placement of chips must be in the intersections where the row and column colors agree.

So, for example, if row 1 is white and column 1 is white, then (1,1) can have a white chip. If row 2 is black and column 2 is black, then (2,2) can have a black chip. But if row 1 is white and column 2 is black, then (1,2) can't have a chip, because it's in a white row and black column.

So, the number of white chips would be the number of white rows times the number of white columns, and the number of black chips would be the number of black rows times the number of black columns.

But since the grid is 5x5, the number of white rows plus black rows equals 5, and same for columns.

So, let me denote:

Let r be the number of white rows (so black rows are 5 - r).

Let c be the number of white columns (so black columns are 5 - c).

Then, the number of white chips is r * c, and the number of black chips is (5 - r) * (5 - c).

But in our problem, we are told that we have 25 white and 25 black chips. So,

r * c =25

(5 - r) * (5 - c)=25

So, same as before.

But earlier, solving these equations leads to no solution because r +c=5 and r*c=25, which has no integer solutions in 0 ≤ r,c ≤5.

Wait, unless r and c are 5 each, but then (5-5)*(5-5)=0≠25.

Hmm, perhaps the problem is that the grid is allowed to have some rows and columns all white, others all black, but the number of white and black chips can vary, and we're to find the number of such maximal placements.

But the problem specifically says that we have 25 white and 25 black chips. So, perhaps the only way is to have all rows and columns be white, but that would require 25 white chips and zero black chips, which isn't the case. Alternatively, all rows and columns black, which would require zero white chips, which also isn't the case.

Wait, I'm stuck here. Maybe I'm making a mistake in assuming that r and c must be between 0 and5. Perhaps r and c can be any integers, but that doesn't make sense because you can't have more than 5 rows or columns.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the number of white chips is r*c and the number of black chips is (5 - r)*(5 - c), and their sum is r*c + (5 - r)*(5 - c) = r*c +25 -5r -5c +r*c = 2r*c -5r -5c +25. And this must equal 50 because we have 25 white and 25 black chips. So,

2r*c -5r -5c +25 =50

Simplify:

2r*c -5r -5c =25

Hmm, same equation as before.

Let me try to find integer solutions where r and c are between 0 and5.

I can try substituting values for r from 0 to5 and see if c comes out as integer.

For r=0:

2*0*c -5*0 -5c =25 → -5c=25 → c=-5 → invalid.

r=1:

2*1*c -5*1 -5c =2c -5 -5c= -3c -5=25 → -3c=30 → c=-10 → invalid.

r=2:

2*2*c -5*2 -5c=4c -10 -5c= -c -10=25 → -c=35 → c=-35 → invalid.

r=3:

2*3*c -5*3 -5c=6c -15 -5c= c -15=25 → c=40 → invalid.

r=4:

2*4*c -5*4 -5c=8c -20 -5c=3c -20=25 →3c=45 →c=15 → invalid.

r=5:

2*5*c -5*5 -5c=10c -25 -5c=5c -25=25 →5c=50 →c=10 → invalid.

So, none of the possible r values from 0 to5 give a valid c within 0 to5. So, that suggests that there's no solution, which contradicts the problem statement.

Wait, perhaps the problem allows for some rows or columns to have no chips. But no, because the problem states that all chips in the same row must be the same color, but it doesn't say that every row must have a chip. So, perhaps some rows can have no chips, and others can have all white or all black.

Wait, but then the number of white and black chips would be determined by the number of white rows and white columns, etc. But if some rows have no chips, then those rows could be considered as neither white nor black, but that complicates things.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think differently. Maybe the grid can have some cells with white chips and some with black, arranged such that each row and column is monochromatic, but not necessarily all rows and columns being used.

Wait, but the problem says "each cell contains at most one chip," so some cells can be empty. But the problem also states that "any additional chip placed would violate one or more of the previous two conditions." So, the placement is maximal.

So, perhaps the grid is colored in such a way that some cells are white, others black, with the constraints that each row and column is uniform, and that no more chips can be added without changing the color of a row or column.

In this case, the number of white and black chips can vary, but in our problem, we're to count the number of such maximal placements that use exactly 25 white and 25 black chips. But that's impossible because the grid only has 25 cells. So, perhaps the problem is to place up to 25 chips, but that's not clear.

Wait, perhaps the problem is to place exactly 25 chips, 25 in total, but the problem says "25 indistinguishable white chips and 25 indistinguishable black chips," which suggests that we have 25 white and 25 black chips, but we're placing some of them, not necessarily all. But that's unclear.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is to place some number of chips, up to 25, with the constraints, and count the number of ways to do that.

But I'm getting stuck, so perhaps I should think about smaller cases.

Let me consider a 1x1 grid.

If it's 1x1, then the only cell can be white or black. So, two possibilities. But since we have 25 white and 25 black chips, perhaps in this case, the number of ways is 2.

But perhaps this isn't helpful.

Wait, let's think about a 2x2 grid. How would the problem apply there?

In a 2x2 grid, we have 4 cells. The problem would require placing some white and black chips such that each row and column is uniform, and the placement is maximal.

But our problem is for a 5x5 grid, but maybe considering smaller grids can help.

Wait, perhaps the solution is that the grid must be entirely white or entirely black, but that can't be because we have both colors.

Wait, no, because if all rows are white and all columns are white, then all cells are white, and we can't have any black chips. Similarly, if all rows and columns are black, we can't have any white chips. So, that's not the case.

Wait, perhaps the grid is split into four quadrants, two of which are white and two black, but arranged such that the number of white and black chips is 25 each. But in a 5x5 grid, that's impossible because 5x5=25, so you can't have 25 white and 25 black in 25 cells.

Wait, I'm really stuck here. Maybe the initial assumption that the white and black regions form rectangles is incorrect, but given the constraints, I don't see another way.

Wait, perhaps the only solution is that the grid is entirely white and entirely black in such a way that each cell is either white or black, but that doesn't make sense because a cell can't be both.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that the rows are all white or all black, and similarly for columns, but the colors can vary across rows and columns. So, for example, some rows are white, others black, and some columns are white, others black, but arranged so that the number of white cells is 25 and black cells is 25.

But in a 5x5 grid, that's impossible because 5x5=25, so you can't have 25 white and 25 black cells. So, perhaps the problem is that we're placing exactly 25 chips, which can be any combination of white and black, but with the constraints.

Wait, the problem says "some of these chips," so perhaps we're placing up to 25 chips, but the exact count isn't specified. But the problem also says that "any additional chip placed would violate one or more of the previous two conditions." So, the placement is maximal.

So, in this case, the number of white and black chips can be any number, but such that you can't add any more without violating the row and column color constraints.

But the problem also mentions that we have 25 white and 25 black chips, but it doesn't say we have to use all of them. So, perhaps the number of white and black chips in the grid can be any number, but the problem is to count the number of maximal placements where the number of white and black chips are 25 each.

Wait, that can't be because the grid only has 25 cells. So, perhaps the problem is to place exactly 25 chips, with any number of white and black, but arranged such that each row and column is uniform, and the placement is maximal.

But then the problem states that we have 25 white and 25 black chips, which is confusing because we can't place more than 25 chips on a 5x5 grid.

Wait, perhaps the problem is to place some chips, not necessarily all, with the constraints, and the number of white and black chips can be any number, but the problem specifically mentions 25 white and 25 black. So, perhaps the problem is to place exactly 25 white and 25 black chips on the grid, but that's impossible because the grid only has 25 cells.

This is really confusing. Maybe I should re-read the problem.

The problem states: "There is a collection of 25 indistinguishable white chips and 25 indistinguishable black chips. Find the number of ways to place some of these chips in the 25 unit cells of a 5×5 grid such that:

each cell contains at most one chip

all chips in the same row and all chips in the same column have the same colour

any additional chip placed on the grid would violate one or more of the previous two conditions."

So, the problem allows placing some of the chips, not necessarily all. So, the number of white and black chips placed can be any number, as long as the constraints are satisfied and the placement is maximal.

But the problem mentions having 25 white and 25 black chips, but doesn't say we have to use all of them. So, perhaps the number of ways is to arrange the chips such that some are white and some are black, with each row and column being monochromatic, and the placement is maximal.

But then the number of white and black chips would vary, but in our case, the problem says we have 25 white and 25 black chips, but we're placing some of them. So, perhaps the number of white and black chips placed can be any number up to 25 each, but that's unclear.

Wait, perhaps the problem is to place exactly 25 white and 25 black chips, but that's impossible on a 5x5 grid because it only has 25 cells. So, perhaps the problem is to place exactly 25 chips in total, which can be any combination of white and black, but arranged such that each row and column is uniform, and the placement is maximal.

In that case, the number of white and black chips can vary, but the total is 25.

Wait, but the problem mentions having 25 white and 25 black chips, but perhaps we're just supposed to use as many as needed, not all.

But I'm getting stuck, so perhaps I should consider that the problem is to count the number of ways to partition the grid into white and black regions, each being a rectangle, such that the number of white and black cells are 25 each. But that's impossible because the grid only has 25 cells.

So, perhaps the problem is to count the number of ways to choose some rows and columns to be white or black, such that the number of white cells is 25 and black cells is 25, but that's impossible.

Wait, maybe the problem is to count the number of ways to choose rows and columns such that the number of white cells is 25 and black cells is 25, but that's impossible because 25+25=50>25.

So, perhaps the problem is misstated, or I'm misinterpreting it.

Wait, perhaps the problem is to place some chips, such that the number of white and black chips placed are each 25, but that's impossible on a 5x5 grid. So, perhaps the problem is to place exactly 25 chips, with some being white and some black, arranged such that each row and column is monochromatic, and the placement is maximal.

In that case, the number of white and black chips can vary, but their total is 25.

But the problem says "25 indistinguishable white chips and 25 indistinguishable black chips," which suggests that we have 25 white and 25 black available, but we can use any number of them.

Wait, perhaps the problem is to place exactly 25 chips, with any number of white and black, but arranged such that each row and column is monochromatic, and the placement is maximal.

In that case, the number of white and black chips can vary, but the total is 25.

But the problem mentions 25 white and 25 black chips, which might imply that we have to use all of them, but that's impossible. So, perhaps the problem is to place exactly 25 chips, with any number of white and black, but arranged under the given constraints.

In that case, the problem reduces to counting the number of maximal placements of 25 chips on a 5x5 grid where each row and column is monochromatic. But that's a different problem.

But I'm not sure. Given the confusion, perhaps I should conclude that the only possible solution is when r=5 and c=5, but that leads to a contradiction in the second equation. So, perhaps the answer is zero, but that can't be because the problem states that such a placement exists.

Alternatively, perhaps the answer is 2, corresponding to all white or all black grids, but that doesn't make sense because we have both colors.

Wait, perhaps the answer is 2^5 * 2^5 = 1024, but that's the number of ways to color each row and column, but without considering the constraints on the number of chips.

But given the time I've spent and the confusion, I think the answer is 2^5 * 2^5 = 1024, but I'm not confident.

The problem requires placing some white and black chips on a 5x5 grid such that each row and column is monochromatic, and the placement is maximal (no additional chip can be added without violating the constraints). The grid must use 25 white and 25 black chips, but since the grid only has 25 cells, this is impossible. Therefore, the number of valid ways is:

\boxed{0}
