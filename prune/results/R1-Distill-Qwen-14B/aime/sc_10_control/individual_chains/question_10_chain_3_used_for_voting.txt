Okay, so I've got this math problem here, and I need to figure out the sum of the elements of set A. Let me start by understanding what's given and what's being asked.

Alice chooses a set A of positive integers. Then Bob lists all finite nonempty sets B of positive integers such that the maximum element of B is in A. Bob's list has 2024 sets. I need to find the sum of the elements of A.

Hmm, let me break this down. So, Bob is listing all possible finite, nonempty sets B where the maximum element of each B is in A. The number of such sets B is 2024. My goal is to figure out what A is and then sum its elements.

First, let me think about what these sets B look like. Each set B is finite and nonempty, and the maximum of B is in A. So, for each element a in A, how many sets B are there where max(B) = a?

Let me consider an example. Suppose A has elements {a1, a2, a3, ..., an}. For each ai in A, the number of sets B where max(B) = ai is equal to the number of subsets of {1, 2, ..., ai-1} times 2, minus 1 (since the set can't be empty). Wait, no, actually, for each ai, the maximum is ai, so B must include ai, and the other elements can be any subset of the numbers less than ai. So, the number of such sets is 2^{ai - 1}, because for each number less than ai, it can be either included or excluded.

Wait, yes! For each ai, the number of sets B with maximum ai is 2^{ai - 1}. Because for each of the numbers from 1 to ai-1, you can choose whether to include them or not in B, but you have to include ai. So the number is 2^{ai - 1}.

Therefore, the total number of sets Bob lists is the sum over all a in A of 2^{a-1}. And according to the problem, this sum is 2024.

So, mathematically, if A = {a1, a2, ..., an}, then:

Σ (from i=1 to n) 2^{ai - 1} = 2024.

I need to find A such that this equation holds, then sum the elements of A.

So, now the problem reduces to finding a set A where the sum of 2^{a-1} for each a in A is 2024, and then find the sum of the elements of A.

Wait, actually, 2024 is the total number of sets, which is the sum of 2^{a-1} for each a in A.

So, 2024 = Σ 2^{a - 1} for each a in A.

Hmm, okay. So, I need to find a set A of positive integers such that when I take 2^{a-1} for each a in A and sum them up, I get 2024.

I think a good approach is to express 2024 as a sum of powers of 2. Because 2^{a-1} is a power of 2, so the sum would be a sum of distinct powers of 2, which corresponds to the binary representation of 2024.

Wait, but wait a second. The sum is a sum of 2^{a-1} for various a's. So each term is a distinct power of 2, since a is a positive integer, and assuming that A has distinct elements, which it does because it's a set.

So, each a is unique, so each 2^{a-1} is a distinct power of 2, which would correspond to the binary digits of 2024.

Wait, but 2024 is equal to the sum of these terms, which are 2^{k} where k is a-1. So, the sum is equal to 2024, which is a number that can be written as a sum of distinct powers of 2.

Therefore, the set A is such that the exponents (a-1) correspond to the positions of 1s in the binary representation of 2024.

So, first, I need to find the binary representation of 2024.

Let me compute that. 2024 divided by 2: 2024 /2 = 1012, remainder 0.

1012 /2=506, rem 0

506/2=253, rem 0

253/2=126 rem 1

126/2=63 rem 0

63/2=31 rem1

31/2=15 rem1

15/2=7 rem1

7/2=3 rem1

3/2=1 rem1

1/2=0 rem1

So writing the remainders from last to first: 1 1 1 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 0.

Wait, let me count: the first division gave me 0, then 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1.

Wait, perhaps I should write it step by step.

Wait, let me think another way. 2024 is equal to 2000 + 24.

2000 is 2*1000, which is 2*(2^3*5^3). Hmm, maybe that's not helpful.

Alternatively, 2024 is equal to 2^10 is 1024, 2^11 is 2048.

Wait, that's too high. So 2^10 is 1024. 2024 -1024 = 1000.

2^9 is 512. 1000-512=488.

2^8 is 256. 488-256=232.

2^7 is 128. 232-128=104.

2^6 is 64. 104-64=40.

2^5 is 32. 40-32=8.

2^3 is 8. 8-8=0.

Wait, so the powers used are 10,9,8,7,6,5,3.

So, 2^10 + 2^9 + 2^8 + 2^7 + 2^6 + 2^5 + 2^3 = 1024 + 512 + 256 + 128 + 64 + 32 + 8.

Let me compute that:

1024 +512 = 1536

1536 +256=1792

1792 +128=1920

1920 +64=1984

1984 +32=2016

2016 +8=2024. Yes.

So, 2024 is equal to 2^10 + 2^9 + 2^8 + 2^7 + 2^6 + 2^5 + 2^3.

So, in terms of exponents, the exponents are 3,5,6,7,8,9,10.

But in our original problem, each term in the sum is 2^{a-1}, so the exponents (a-1) correspond to 3,5,6,7,8,9,10.

Therefore, a-1=3,5,6,7,8,9,10.

So, each a is (3+1)=4, (5+1)=6, (6+1)=7, (7+1)=8, (8+1)=9, (9+1)=10, (10+1)=11.

Wait, hold on. Wait, no. Wait, each term is 2^{a-1}, so if the exponent is k, then a-1=k, so a=k+1.

So, in our case, the exponents are 3,5,6,7,8,9,10. So, a is 4,6,7,8,9,10,11.

Wait, but let me confirm:

If a=4, then 2^{4-1}=2^3=8.

a=6, 2^5=32.

a=7, 2^6=64.

a=8, 2^7=128.

a=9, 2^8=256.

a=10, 2^9=512.

a=11, 2^10=1024.

So, the sum is 8 +32 +64 +128 +256 +512 +1024.

Calculating this sum: 8+32=40; 40+64=104; 104+128=232; 232+256=488; 488+512=1000; 1000+1024=2024.

Yes, that's correct.

So, the set A has elements 4,6,7,8,9,10,11.

Wait, but hold on a second. Are these all the elements? Because 2024 is represented as the sum of 2^3 +2^5 +2^6 +2^7 +2^8 +2^9 +2^10.

So, the exponents are 3,5,6,7,8,9,10. So a-1=3,5,6,7,8,9,10. So a=4,6,7,8,9,10,11.

Hence, A is {4,6,7,8,9,10,11}.

Wait, but why does a-1 correspond to the exponents in the binary representation?

Because each term in the sum, 2^{a-1}, is a power of two, and when you add them up, you get 2024. So, the set A is constructed such that each element a in A corresponds to a 1 in the binary representation of 2024, but shifted by 1.

Wait, no, actually, the exponents are the positions where 2024 has 1s in its binary representation. So, the exponents are the bits set to 1, and each exponent is (a-1). Therefore, a is exponent+1.

So, for 2024 in binary, we have 11111101000, which is from the exponents 10,9,8,7,6,5,3.

Wait, hang on. Wait, 2^10 is 1024, 2^9 is 512, 2^8 is 256, 2^7 is 128, 2^6 is 64, 2^5 is 32, 2^3 is 8. So, the binary representation would have 1s at positions 10,9,8,7,6,5,3 (counting from 0).

So, the binary digits would be:

Position: 10 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 0

Bit:        1  1 1 1 1 1 0 1 0 0 0

Wait, but that can't be right because 2^3 is 8. So position 3 is the 4th bit from the right. So, the binary representation of 2024 is 11111101000.

Wait, let's confirm that.

Compute 2024 in binary:

Let me calculate 2^10 = 1024, 2024 - 1024 = 1000.

1000 - 512 (2^9) = 488.

488 -256 (2^8)=232.

232-128 (2^7)=104.

104-64 (2^6)=40.

40-32 (2^5)=8.

8-8 (2^3)=0.

So, yes, the exponents used are 10,9,8,7,6,5,3.

So, the binary representation is:

Starting from the highest bit (2^10) as 1, then 2^9=1, 2^8=1, 2^7=1, 2^6=1, 2^5=1, 2^4=0, 2^3=1, 2^2=0, 2^1=0, 2^0=0.

So, writing that out: 11111101000.

So, binary digits from 10 down to 0:

1 (2^10), 1 (2^9), 1 (2^8), 1 (2^7), 1 (2^6), 1 (2^5), 0 (2^4), 1 (2^3), 0, 0, 0.

So, positions 10,9,8,7,6,5,3 have 1s.

So, each of these exponents corresponds to a-1, where a is an element of A.

Therefore, the elements of A are:

For exponent 10: a =10+1=11

Exponent 9: a=9+1=10

Exponent 8: a=8+1=9

Exponent 7: a=7+1=8

Exponent 6: a=6+1=7

Exponent 5: a=5+1=6

Exponent 3: a=3+1=4

So, A is {4,6,7,8,9,10,11}.

Hence, the elements of A are 4,6,7,8,9,10,11.

Now, the problem asks for the sum of the elements of A. So, I need to compute 4 +6 +7 +8 +9 +10 +11.

Let me add them up step by step.

4 +6 =10

10 +7=17

17 +8=25

25 +9=34

34 +10=44

44 +11=55.

So, the sum is 55.

Wait, that seems low. Let me check my addition again.

4 +6=10

10+7=17

17+8=25

25+9=34

34+10=44

44+11=55. Yes, same result.

So, the sum of the elements of A is 55.

But let me make sure that I didn't make a mistake in interpreting the problem. Did I correctly understand how the sets B are counted?

Each set B is a finite nonempty set where the maximum is in A. For each a in A, the number of such B is 2^{a-1}. Because for each a, the set B must include a, and any subset of {1,2,...,a-1} can be included. So, the number is indeed 2^{a-1}.

Therefore, the total number of such sets is the sum over a in A of 2^{a-1}, which equals 2024.

So, I think my approach is correct. The set A is {4,6,7,8,9,10,11}, and their sum is 55.

I don't see any mistakes in the logic. So, I think the answer is 55.

Alice chooses a set \( A \) of positive integers. Bob then lists all finite nonempty sets \( B \) of positive integers where the maximum element of \( B \) is in \( A \). The number of such sets \( B \) is given as 2024. We need to determine the sum of the elements of \( A \).

For each element \( a \) in \( A \), the number of sets \( B \) with maximum element \( a \) is \( 2^{a-1} \). Therefore, the total number of sets Bob lists is the sum of \( 2^{a-1} \) for all \( a \) in \( A \). This sum equals 2024.

To find \( A \), express 2024 as a sum of distinct powers of 2. The binary representation of 2024 is \( 11111101000_2 \), which corresponds to the powers \( 2^{10} + 2^9 + 2^8 + 2^7 + 2^6 + 2^5 + 2^3 \). Each exponent \( k \) in this sum corresponds to \( a - 1 \), so \( a = k + 1 \).

Thus, the elements of \( A \) are \( 4, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11 \). Summing these elements:

\[
4 + 6 + 7 + 8 + 9 + 10 + 11 = 55
\]

The sum of the elements of \( A \) is \(\boxed{55}\).
