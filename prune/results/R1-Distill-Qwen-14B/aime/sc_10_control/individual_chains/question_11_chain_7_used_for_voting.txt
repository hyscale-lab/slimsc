Okay, so I've got this math problem here, and I need to find the largest possible real part of the expression (75 + 117i)z + (96 + 144i)/z, where z is a complex number with |z| = 4. Hmm, let me try to figure this out step by step.

First, I remember that any complex number z with |z| = 4 can be written in the form z = 4e^{iθ}, where θ is the argument of z. Alternatively, since |z| is 4, 1/z would be (1/4)e^{-iθ} because the magnitude of 1/z is 1/|z|. So maybe I can express both terms in terms of θ and then simplify.

Let me write z as 4e^{iθ}. Then, 1/z would be (1/4)e^{-iθ}. So substituting these into the expression:

(75 + 117i) * 4e^{iθ} + (96 + 144i) * (1/4)e^{-iθ}

Let me compute each part separately. 

First term: (75 + 117i) * 4e^{iθ}. Let's compute the scalar factor 4*(75 + 117i). 4*75 is 300, and 4*117i is 468i. So the first term becomes (300 + 468i)e^{iθ}.

Second term: (96 + 144i)*(1/4)e^{-iθ}. Let's compute 1/4*(96 + 144i). 96/4 is 24, and 144/4 is 36, so that's (24 + 36i)e^{-iθ}.

So the entire expression is (300 + 468i)e^{iθ} + (24 + 36i)e^{-iθ}.

Now, I need to compute the real part of this expression. Remember that Re(a e^{iθ} + b e^{-iθ}) is Re(a e^{iθ}) + Re(b e^{-iθ}).

Let me write a = 300 + 468i and b = 24 + 36i.

So Re(a e^{iθ}) = Re( (300 + 468i)(cosθ + i sinθ) )

Expanding this, it's Re(300 cosθ - 468 sinθ + i(300 sinθ + 468 cosθ)) which is 300 cosθ - 468 sinθ.

Similarly, Re(b e^{-iθ}) = Re( (24 + 36i)(cosθ - i sinθ) )

Expanding this, it's Re(24 cosθ + 36 sinθ + i(-24 sinθ + 36 cosθ)) which is 24 cosθ + 36 sinθ.

So adding these two, the total real part is (300 cosθ - 468 sinθ) + (24 cosθ + 36 sinθ).

Combining like terms: (300 + 24) cosθ + (-468 + 36) sinθ.

300 + 24 is 324, and -468 +36 is -432. So the real part simplifies to 324 cosθ - 432 sinθ.

So the problem reduces to finding the maximum value of 324 cosθ - 432 sinθ. Hmm, that sounds like an expression of the form A cosθ + B sinθ, which I can write as C cos(θ + φ), right?

Wait, actually, the general formula is that A cosθ + B sinθ can be written as R cos(θ - φ), where R = sqrt(A^2 + B^2) and tanφ = B/A. Or maybe R is sqrt(A^2 + B^2). Wait, let me recall.

Yes, for an expression like A cosθ + B sinθ, it can be rewritten as R cos(θ - φ), where R = sqrt(A² + B²) and φ is such that cosφ = A/R and sinφ = B/R. So in this case, A is 324 and B is -432.

So R would be sqrt(324² + (-432)^2). Let me compute that.

First, compute 324 squared. 324 is 18^2, so 324 * 324 = (18^2)^2 = 18^4. Wait, that's 104976. Alternatively, 300^2 is 90000, and 24^2 is 576, and cross terms 2*300*24=14400. So 324^2 = (300 + 24)^2 = 300² + 2*300*24 + 24² = 90000 + 14400 + 576 = 90000 + 14400 is 104400, plus 576 is 104976.

Similarly, 432^2: 400^2 is 160000, 32^2 is 1024, cross term 2*400*32=25600. So 432^2 = (400 + 32)^2 = 400² + 2*400*32 + 32² = 160000 + 25600 + 1024. 160000 + 25600 is 185600, plus 1024 is 186624. So R is sqrt(104976 + 186624). Let's add them: 104976 + 186624 = 291600. So R is sqrt(291600).

What's sqrt(291600)?  Well, 500² is 250000, 540² is 291600 because 54² is 2916, so 540² is 291600. So R is 540.

So the real part is equal to 540 cos(θ + φ), where φ is such that cosφ = 324/540 and sinφ = (-432)/540.

Simplify those fractions: 324/540. Let's see, both are divisible by 108? 324 ÷ 108 is 3, 540 ÷108 is 5. So 3/5. Similarly, -432/540. Let's divide numerator and denominator by 108: -432 ÷108 is -4, 540 ÷108 is 5. So -4/5.

So cosφ = 3/5, sinφ = -4/5. Therefore φ is in the fourth quadrant. Let me compute φ. tanφ = sinφ / cosφ = (-4/5)/(3/5) = -4/3. So φ = arctan(-4/3). But since it's in the fourth quadrant, φ would be -arctan(4/3). Alternatively, I can write it as 2π - arctan(4/3) if I prefer positive angles. But since cosine is even and sine is odd, I can just use this to write the expression.

But since I'm taking cos(θ + φ), and I can also write it as cos(θ - (-φ)), it doesn't really matter much. The key point is that the maximum value of cos(anything) is 1, so the maximum of 540 cos(θ + φ) is 540 *1 = 540.

Therefore, the maximum real part is 540. So that's the answer.

Wait, let me double-check because sometimes when dealing with signs, it's easy to make a mistake. The expression was 324 cosθ - 432 sinθ. So that's equivalent to A cosθ + B sinθ where A is 324, B is -432. So when I compute R, it's sqrt(324² + (-432)^2) which we found to be 540. So the maximum value is R, which is 540. So yes, that should be correct.

Alternatively, I can think of it as a dot product. The real part is 324 cosθ -432 sinθ, which can be written as [324, -432] · [cosθ, sinθ]. The maximum value of the dot product is the magnitude of the vector [324, -432], which is sqrt(324² + (-432)^2) = 540. So that's another way to see it.

Therefore, the largest possible real part is 540.
