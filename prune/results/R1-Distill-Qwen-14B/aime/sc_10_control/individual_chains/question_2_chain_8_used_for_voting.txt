Okay, so I have this problem here. Let me try to understand it step by step. There are points O, A, and B given. O is at (0,0), the origin. A is at (1/2, 0), so that's halfway along the x-axis between O and (1,0). B is at (0, sqrt(3)/2), which is somewhere along the y-axis between O and (0,1), but closer to (0,1) since sqrt(3)/2 is about 0.866.

Then, there's a family of segments PQ of unit length lying in the first quadrant. Each segment PQ has P on the x-axis and Q on the y-axis. So, these are all possible unit-length segments connecting a point on the x-axis to a point on the y-axis, staying in the first quadrant. That makes sense.

The problem says that there's a unique point C on segment AB, different from A and B, that doesn't belong to any other segment from this family F except for AB itself. So, C is on AB, and no other unit-length segment PQ from F passes through C. We need to find OC squared, which is the square of the distance from the origin to point C, and express it as a fraction p/q where p and q are coprime, then find p + q.

Hmm, okay. So, the first thing I need to figure out is what this family F of segments looks like. Each segment PQ has length 1, with P on the x-axis and Q on the y-axis. So, if a point P is (a, 0) on the x-axis, then Q would be (0, b) on the y-axis such that the distance between (a,0) and (0,b) is 1.

Let me write that down. The distance between P(a,0) and Q(0,b) is sqrt(a² + b²) = 1. So, a² + b² = 1. Therefore, for each such segment PQ, a² + b² = 1. So, these are all points (a, b) where a is on the x-axis and b is on the y-axis, linked by this equation.

Wait a second, but in this problem, the points P and Q are on the axes, so each segment is between (a,0) and (0,b) where a and b satisfy a² + b² = 1. So, the segments are all in the first quadrant, connecting (a,0) to (0,b) with that condition.

So, the family F consists of all such segments. So, for each a between 0 and 1, there's a corresponding b such that b = sqrt(1 - a²), and vice versa.

Now, the point C is on AB, and it's unique in that it's not on any other segment from F except AB. So, AB is one of these segments in F, right? Because A is (1/2, 0) and B is (0, sqrt(3)/2). Let me check if the distance between A and B is 1.

Distance AB: sqrt[(1/2 - 0)^2 + (0 - sqrt(3)/2)^2] = sqrt[(1/4) + (3/4)] = sqrt(1) = 1. Yes, so AB is indeed a member of F.

So, AB is one of these segments, and C is a point on AB that isn't on any other segment from F. Therefore, for C to be unique in this way, it must be a point where if we draw any other segment PQ from F, it doesn't pass through C. So, C is the only point on AB that lies on AB and no other PQ in F.

So, our goal is to find OC² for this point C.

How do I approach this? Maybe parametrize AB and then find C such that when we consider any other PQ from F, it doesn't pass through C.

Alternatively, maybe think about the envelope of all these segments. The envelope is a curve that is tangent to each member of a family of curves. In this case, maybe the envelope of the family F is a curve that touches each PQ, and maybe C is the point where AB is tangent to this envelope?

Wait, I'm not sure if that's the right approach. Alternatively, perhaps I can think of the set of all such segments PQ as lines in the first quadrant, each connecting (a,0) to (0,b) with a² + b² = 1. So, each PQ is a line, and the family F is a family of lines.

So, the family F is all lines that pass through (a,0) and (0,b) with a² + b² = 1.

So, each such line can be written as x/a + y/b = 1, but with the condition a² + b² = 1.

So, the equation of each PQ is x/a + y/b = 1, with a² + b² = 1.

We can parametrize this as follows. Let me use a parameter theta such that a = cos(theta) and b = sin(theta). Because then a² + b² = cos²(theta) + sin²(theta) = 1. So, yes, that works.

So, each line can be written as x / cos(theta) + y / sin(theta) = 1. So, the equation is x sec(theta) + y csc(theta) = 1.

So, that's a parametrization of the family F.

Now, AB is one such line. Let's see what theta is for AB.

Point A is (1/2, 0), so a = 1/2, which would be cos(theta) = 1/2, so theta = 60 degrees or pi/3 radians. Then b = sqrt(1 - (1/2)^2) = sqrt(3)/2, which matches point B. So, AB corresponds to theta = pi/3.

So, the line AB is x/(1/2) + y/(sqrt(3)/2) = 1, which is 2x + (2/sqrt(3)) y = 1, and indeed, that's the equation of AB.

So, now, the point C is on AB, and it's the point where no other line from F passes through it except AB.

So, for any other theta ≠ pi/3, the line x sec(theta) + y csc(theta) = 1 does not pass through C.

So, how can we find such a point C on AB?

Perhaps it's the point where AB is the only tangent line from F that passes through C. Or, more precisely, the point C lies on AB and for any other line in F, C is not on that line.

So, the point C is such that there's no theta ≠ pi/3 for which C lies on the line x sec(theta) + y csc(theta) = 1.

So, perhaps, we can write the equation for C being on another line from F, set it up, and find the condition that this equation has exactly one solution (theta = pi/3). That is, for C on AB, the equation x sec(theta) + y csc(theta) = 1 has only theta = pi/3 as a solution.

Alternatively, maybe we can use the concept of duality. Each point (x,y) in the plane can be associated with a line equation. But perhaps that might complicate things.

Alternatively, maybe find the envelope of the family F. The envelope is a curve that is tangent to each member of the family at some point. So, for each theta, the envelope touches the line x sec(theta) + y csc(theta) = 1 at exactly one point.

If we can find the envelope, then perhaps point C is the point where AB is tangent to this envelope. Because if C is on AB and also on the envelope, then it's the point of tangency. Since the envelope is the boundary of the region covered by the family F, any point inside the envelope would lie on some line from F, and any point outside wouldn't lie on any line from F. But in our case, point C is on AB and not on any other line from F, so maybe it's on the envelope.

Let me try to compute the envelope of this family of lines.

The envelope of a family of curves F(theta) = 0 satisfies both F(theta) = 0 and dF/dtheta = 0.

So, in our case, F(theta) = x sec(theta) + y csc(theta) - 1.

Compute dF/dtheta:

dF/dtheta = x * sec(theta) tan(theta) - y * csc(theta) cot(theta)

Set F(theta) = 0 and dF/dtheta = 0.

So, we have two equations:

1. x sec(theta) + y csc(theta) = 1

2. x sec(theta) tan(theta) - y csc(theta) cot(theta) = 0

Let me write them as:

Equation (1): x / cos(theta) + y / sin(theta) = 1

Equation (2): x sin(theta)/cos²(theta) - y cos(theta)/sin²(theta) = 0

Hmm, that's a bit messy, but perhaps we can manipulate these equations to eliminate theta.

Let me denote u = cos(theta), v = sin(theta). So, u² + v² = 1.

Then, equation (1): x/u + y/v = 1

Equation (2): x (v)/u² - y (u)/v² = 0

So, equation (2): (x v)/u² = (y u)/v²

Cross multiplying: x v^3 = y u^3

So, x v^3 = y u^3 → x / y = (u^3)/(v^3) = (u/v)^3.

But from equation (1), let's express x in terms of y or vice versa.

From equation (1): x = u (1 - y / v )

Plugging into x / y = (u/v)^3:

[ u (1 - y / v ) ] / y = (u / v )^3

Simplify:

u (1 - y / v ) / y = u^3 / v^3

Divide both sides by u (assuming u ≠ 0, which it isn't because theta is in the first quadrant so cos(theta) is positive):

(1 - y / v ) / y = u^2 / v^3

Hmm, not sure if that's helpful yet.

Alternatively, perhaps express x from equation (1):

x = u (1 - y / v )

Then plug into equation (2):

[ u (1 - y / v ) ] * (v) / u² = [ y u ] / v²

Simplify left side: [ (1 - y / v ) v ] / u = (v - y ) / u

Right side: y u / v²

So,

(v - y ) / u = y u / v²

Multiply both sides by u v²:

(v - y) v² = y u^2

Expand left side: v^3 - y v² = y u²

Bring all terms to one side: v^3 = y v² + y u² = y (v² + u² ) = y (1), since u² + v² = 1.

Thus, v^3 = y → y = v^3.

So, from this, we have y = v^3.

Then, from equation (1): x = u (1 - y / v ) = u (1 - v^3 / v ) = u (1 - v² )

But since u² = 1 - v², so u = sqrt(1 - v² )

Wait, but we can write u = sqrt(1 - v² ), but perhaps we can express x in terms of y.

Since y = v^3, and u = sqrt(1 - v² ). So,

x = u (1 - v² ) = sqrt(1 - v² ) (1 - v² )

But 1 - v² = u², so sqrt(1 - v² ) = u.

Wait, that's a bit circular. Let me think.

Alternatively, since y = v^3 and u = sqrt(1 - v² ), let's express x in terms of y.

We have u = sqrt(1 - v² ), and y = v^3.

Let me solve for v in terms of y: v = y^(1/3)

Then, u = sqrt(1 - (y^(1/3))^2 ) = sqrt(1 - y^(2/3) )

So, x = u (1 - v² ) = sqrt(1 - y^(2/3) ) [ 1 - (y^(1/3))^2 ]

Simplify:

x = sqrt(1 - y^(2/3)) [ 1 - y^(2/3) ]

Let me square both sides to eliminate the square root:

x² = (1 - y^(2/3))² (1 - y^(2/3))² ?

Wait, no, that's not right. Wait, let me correct that.

Wait, x = sqrt(1 - y^(2/3)) multiplied by (1 - y^(2/3)).

So, x = (1 - y^(2/3))^(3/2 )

Hmm, that doesn't seem immediately helpful, but perhaps we can square both sides:

x² = (1 - y^(2/3))^3

Let me let t = y^(1/3), so y = t^3, and then y^(2/3) = t^2.

Then, equation becomes x² = (1 - t² )^3.

So, x² = (1 - t² )^3.

But then, since y = t^3, we can express t = y^(1/3).

So, x² = (1 - (y^(2/3)) )^3.

Hmm, perhaps we can write this in terms of x and y without parameters.

Let me see. Let me write x² = (1 - y^(2/3))^3.

Maybe take the cube root on both sides:

x^(2/3) = 1 - y^(2/3)

So,

y^(2/3) = 1 - x^(2/3)

Raise both sides to the power of 3/2:

y = [1 - x^(2/3) ]^(3/2 )

Hmm, that's a parametrization of the envelope.

Wait, but perhaps it's better to write it as:

x^(2/3) + y^(2/3) = 1

Wait, is that the case?

Wait, let me see. If x^(2/3) + y^(2/3) = 1, would that be the envelope?

Wait, let me check. From x² = (1 - y^(2/3))^3, let's see if that's equivalent to x^(2/3) + y^(2/3) = 1.

Wait, no. Let's compute:

If x^(2/3) + y^(2/3) = 1, then (x^(2/3)) = 1 - y^(2/3), so x² = (1 - y^(2/3))³, which is exactly the equation we have. So, yes, the envelope is x^(2/3) + y^(2/3) = 1.

Therefore, the envelope of the family F is the astroid given by x^(2/3) + y^(2/3) = 1.

So, the envelope is an astroid, and the point C is the point where AB is tangent to this astroid.

Wait, but AB is a line in F, so it must be tangent to the envelope. Because each line in F is tangent to the envelope.

So, to find point C, we can find the point of tangency between AB and the astroid x^(2/3) + y^(2/3) =1.

So, AB is the line 2x + (2/sqrt(3)) y = 1, as we saw earlier.

We need to find the point (x, y) that lies on both AB and the astroid, and where the line AB is tangent to the astroid.

So, let's set up the equations:

1. 2x + (2/sqrt(3)) y = 1

2. x^(2/3) + y^(2/3) = 1

Additionally, the line AB must be tangent to the astroid at point C, so the gradient of the astroid at point C must be equal to the slope of AB.

First, let's find the slope of AB.

AB goes from (1/2, 0) to (0, sqrt(3)/2). So, the slope is (sqrt(3)/2 - 0)/(0 - 1/2) )= (sqrt(3)/2) / (-1/2) )= -sqrt(3).

So, the slope of AB is -sqrt(3).

Now, let's compute the derivative of the astroid at point (x, y).

The astroid equation is x^(2/3) + y^(2/3) = 1.

Differentiate both sides with respect to x:

(2/3) x^(-1/3) + (2/3) y^(-1/3) dy/dx = 0

Solving for dy/dx:

dy/dx = - [ (2/3) x^(-1/3) ] / [ (2/3) y^(-1/3) ] = - (x^(-1/3)) / (y^(-1/3)) ) = - (y^(1/3)) / (x^(1/3))

So, the slope of the astroid at point (x, y) is - (y^(1/3)) / (x^(1/3)).

We know that at point C, this slope must equal the slope of AB, which is -sqrt(3).

So,

- (y^(1/3)) / (x^(1/3)) = -sqrt(3)

Simplify:

(y^(1/3)) / (x^(1/3)) = sqrt(3)

So,

(y / x )^(1/3) = sqrt(3) → (y / x ) = (sqrt(3))^3 = 3^(3/2) = 3 * sqrt(3)

So,

y = 3 * sqrt(3) x

But wait, that seems a bit high. Let me check that step again.

Wait, (y/x)^(1/3) = sqrt(3) → (y/x) = (sqrt(3))^3 = (3^(1/2))^3 = 3^(3/2) = 3 * sqrt(3). So, yes, that's correct.

So, y = 3*sqrt(3) * x.

Now, substitute this into equation (1): 2x + (2/sqrt(3)) y =1.

Substituting y = 3*sqrt(3) x:

2x + (2/sqrt(3)) * 3*sqrt(3) x = 1

Simplify the second term: (2/sqrt(3)) * 3*sqrt(3) = 2 * 3 =6.

So, equation becomes:

2x + 6x =1 → 8x=1 → x=1/8.

Then, y=3*sqrt(3) * (1/8) )= 3*sqrt(3)/8.

So, point C is at (1/8, 3*sqrt(3)/8).

Now, let's check if this point lies on the astroid.

x^(2/3) + y^(2/3) = (1/8)^(2/3) + (3*sqrt(3)/8)^(2/3).

Compute each term:

(1/8)^(2/3) = (1^(2/3))/(8^(2/3)) = 1 / ( (8^(1/3))^2 ) = 1/(2^2) )= 1/4.

Similarly, (3*sqrt(3)/8)^(2/3) = ( (3*sqrt(3))^(2/3) ) / (8^(2/3) ).

Compute numerator: (3*sqrt(3))^(2/3) = [3^(3/2)]^(2/3) = 3^( (3/2)*(2/3) )=3^1=3.

Denominator: 8^(2/3)= (8^(1/3))^2=2^2=4.

So, (3*sqrt(3)/8)^(2/3)=3/4.

So, x^(2/3)+ y^(2/3)=1/4 +3/4=1. Correct, so point C is indeed on the astroid.

So, that checks out.

Therefore, point C is at (1/8, 3*sqrt(3)/8).

Now, we need to compute OC², where O is (0,0).

OC²= (1/8)^2 + (3*sqrt(3)/8)^2.

Calculate each term:

(1/8)^2 =1/64.

(3*sqrt(3)/8)^2 = (9 *3)/64 =27/64.

So, OC²=1/64 +27/64=28/64=7/16.

So, 7 and 16 are coprime, so p=7, q=16, and p+q=23.

Wait, that seems straightforward, but let me double-check the calculations.

So, point C is at (1/8, 3√3/8).

OC² is x² + y²: (1/8)^2 + (3√3/8)^2.

Compute each:

1/8 squared is 1/64.

3√3 is 3*1.732≈5.196, but let's compute (3√3)^2 =9*3=27.

So, (3√3/8)^2=27/64.

So, sum is 1/64 +27/64=28/64=7/16.

Yes, that's correct.

So, OC²=7/16, so p=7, q=16, p+q=23.

Therefore, the answer is 23.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To solve the problem, we start by identifying the family of segments \(\overline{PQ}\) of unit length lying in the first quadrant, with \(P\) on the x-axis and \(Q\) on the y-axis. Each such segment satisfies \(a^2 + b^2 = 1\), where \(P = (a, 0)\) and \(Q = (0, b)\). The equation of each segment can be written as \(\frac{x}{a} + \frac{y}{b} = 1\), with \(a^2 + b^2 = 1\).

We parametrize this family using \(\theta\) such that \(a = \cos(\theta)\) and \(b = \sin(\theta)\). Thus, each line is given by \(\frac{x}{\cos(\theta)} + \frac{y}{\sin(\theta)} = 1\).

The segment \(\overline{AB}\) corresponds to \(\theta = \frac{\pi}{3}\), with \(A = \left(\frac{1}{2}, 0\right)\) and \(B = \left(0, \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right)\). The equation of \(\overline{AB}\) is \(2x + \frac{2}{\sqrt{3}}y = 1\).

To find the unique point \(C\) on \(\overline{AB}\) that does not lie on any other segment from the family, we determine the envelope of the family of lines. The envelope is found by solving the system:
\[
\frac{x}{\cos(\theta)} + \frac{y}{\sin(\theta)} = 1
\]
\[
\frac{x \sin(\theta)}{\cos^2(\theta)} - \frac{y \cos(\theta)}{\sin^2(\theta)} = 0
\]
This leads to the astroid equation \(x^{2/3} + y^{2/3} = 1\).

The point \(C\) is where \(\overline{AB}\) is tangent to this astroid. The slope of \(\overline{AB}\) is \(-\sqrt{3}\), which must equal the derivative of the astroid at \(C\). Solving, we find \(C\) at \(\left(\frac{1}{8}, \frac{3\sqrt{3}}{8}\right)\).

Finally, we compute \(OC^2\):
\[
OC^2 = \left(\frac{1}{8}\right)^2 + \left(\frac{3\sqrt{3}}{8}\right)^2 = \frac{1}{64} + \frac{27}{64} = \frac{28}{64} = \frac{7}{16}
\]
Thus, \(p = 7\) and \(q = 16\), giving \(p + q = 23\).

\(\boxed{23}\)
