Okay, so I've got this problem here where I need to find the number of triples of nonnegative integers (a, b, c) that satisfy two conditions: a + b + c = 300 and a²b + a²c + b²a + b²c + c²a + c²b = 6,000,000. Hmm, that looks a bit complex, but maybe I can break it down.

First, let me understand what the problem is asking. We have three variables a, b, c, all nonnegative integers, which add up to 300. And then there's this other equation involving their squares and products. I need to find the number of such triples that satisfy both equations.

Let me write down the given equations:

1. a + b + c = 300
2. a²b + a²c + b²a + b²c + c²a + c²b = 6,000,000

Looking at the second equation, I notice that each term is a square of one variable multiplied by another. Maybe I can factor this expression somehow or relate it to the first equation.

Let me see if I can factor the second equation. It has terms like a²b and a²c. I can factor a² from those two terms, so that gives a²(b + c). Similarly, I can factor b² from the next two terms: b²(a + c), and c² from the last two: c²(a + b).

So, the second equation becomes:

a²(b + c) + b²(a + c) + c²(a + b) = 6,000,000

Now, from the first equation, I know that a + b + c = 300. So, for example, b + c = 300 - a, a + c = 300 - b, and a + b = 300 - c.

Let me substitute these into the second equation:

a²(300 - a) + b²(300 - b) + c²(300 - c) = 6,000,000

That's interesting. So now the equation is in terms of each variable squared times (300 minus that variable). Let me expand this:

a²(300) - a³ + b²(300) - b³ + c²(300) - c³ = 6,000,000

Which simplifies to:

300(a² + b² + c²) - (a³ + b³ + c³) = 6,000,000

Hmm, so now I have an equation involving a² + b² + c² and a³ + b³ + c³. Maybe I can relate these to other symmetric sums.

I know that (a + b + c)^2 = a² + b² + c² + 2(ab + bc + ac). Since a + b + c is 300, then:

300² = a² + b² + c² + 2(ab + bc + ac)

So, 90,000 = a² + b² + c² + 2(ab + bc + ac)

And from this, I can express a² + b² + c² as 90,000 - 2(ab + bc + ac). Let me note that down.

So, a² + b² + c² = 90,000 - 2(ab + bc + ac)

Now, let's go back to the other equation we had:

300(a² + b² + c²) - (a³ + b³ + c³) = 6,000,000

Substituting a² + b² + c² from above gives:

300*(90,000 - 2(ab + bc + ac)) - (a³ + b³ + c³) = 6,000,000

Let me compute 300*90,000. 300*90,000 = 27,000,000.

So, 27,000,000 - 600(ab + bc + ac) - (a³ + b³ + c³) = 6,000,000

Let me rearrange this:

-600(ab + bc + ac) - (a³ + b³ + c³) = 6,000,000 - 27,000,000

Which is:

-600(ab + bc + ac) - (a³ + b³ + c³) = -21,000,000

Multiply both sides by -1 to make it positive:

600(ab + bc + ac) + (a³ + b³ + c³) = 21,000,000

So now, I have:

a³ + b³ + c³ + 600(ab + bc + ac) = 21,000,000

Hmm, I wonder if there's a way to factor this or relate it to something else.

Wait, I remember that a³ + b³ + c³ - 3abc = (a + b + c)(a² + b² + c² - ab - bc - ac). But that's when we have a³ + b³ + c³ - 3abc. Here, I have a³ + b³ + c³ plus 600(ab + bc + ac). So maybe it's not directly applicable.

Alternatively, perhaps I can express a³ + b³ + c³ in terms of other known quantities.

Wait, let's see. We have a + b + c = 300, so maybe if I can express a³ + b³ + c³ in terms of that.

I recall that:

(a + b + c)^3 = a³ + b³ + c³ + 3(a + b)(b + c)(c + a)

Wait, no, actually, the expansion is:

(a + b + c)^3 = a³ + b³ + c³ + 3(a + b)(a + c) + 3(b + c)(a + b) ... Wait, maybe I should compute it correctly.

Let me compute (a + b + c)^3:

(a + b + c)^3 = a³ + b³ + c³ + 3a²b + 3a²c + 3ab² + 3ac² + 3b²c + 3bc² + 6abc

Which can be written as:

a³ + b³ + c³ + 3(a²b + a²c + ab² + b²c + a c² + b c²) + 6abc

But looking back at our second equation, which is the second given condition, we have a²b + a²c + b²a + b²c + c²a + c²b = 6,000,000. So that's exactly the term multiplied by 3 in the expansion above.

So, (a + b + c)^3 = a³ + b³ + c³ + 3*(6,000,000) + 6abc

But since a + b + c = 300, (a + b + c)^3 = 300^3 = 27,000,000.

So, 27,000,000 = a³ + b³ + c³ + 18,000,000 + 6abc

Let me rearrange this:

a³ + b³ + c³ + 6abc = 27,000,000 - 18,000,000 = 9,000,000

So, a³ + b³ + c³ + 6abc = 9,000,000

But earlier, we had another equation:

a³ + b³ + c³ + 600(ab + bc + ac) = 21,000,000

So, let me write both equations:

1. a³ + b³ + c³ + 6abc = 9,000,000
2. a³ + b³ + c³ + 600(ab + bc + ac) = 21,000,000

Let me subtract equation 1 from equation 2 to eliminate a³ + b³ + c³.

So, equation2 - equation1:

(a³ + b³ + c³ + 600(ab + bc + ac)) - (a³ + b³ + c³ + 6abc) = 21,000,000 - 9,000,000

Simplify:

600(ab + bc + ac) - 6abc = 12,000,000

Divide both sides by 6:

100(ab + bc + ac) - abc = 2,000,000

So now, we have:

100(ab + bc + ac) - abc = 2,000,000

Let me write this as:

abc - 100(ab + bc + ac) = -2,000,000

Hmm, that's an equation involving ab, bc, ac, and abc.

Let me think. Maybe I can factor this or find a way to express it in terms of (100 - a)(100 - b)(100 - c) or something similar.

Wait, another approach: let's denote x = a, y = b, z = c.

So, the equation becomes:

xyz - 100(xy + yz + zx) = -2,000,000

Let me rearrange:

xyz - 100xy - 100yz - 100zx = -2,000,000

Hmm, perhaps factor by grouping. Let me try adding 100^3 to both sides to see if that helps.

Wait, let me think about the form (x - 100)(y - 100)(z - 100). Let's expand that.

(x - 100)(y - 100)(z - 100) = xyz - 100xy - 100xz - 100yz + 10,000x + 10,000y + 10,000z - 1,000,000

Hmm, that's more complicated than what we have. Let me see what we have versus this expansion.

We have xyz - 100xy - 100yz - 100zx = -2,000,000

Comparing to the expansion, which is:

xyz - 100xy - 100xz - 100yz + 10,000x + 10,000y + 10,000z - 1,000,000

So, the difference is that our expression has an extra 10,000x + 10,000y + 10,000z - 1,000,000 compared to the equation we have.

So, perhaps:

xyz - 100xy - 100yz - 100zx = (x - 100)(y - 100)(z - 100) - 10,000(x + y + z) + 1,000,000

So, if I set:

xyz - 100xy - 100yz - 100zx = (x - 100)(y - 100)(z - 100) - 10,000(x + y + z) + 1,000,000

Then, our equation:

xyz - 100xy - 100yz - 100zx = -2,000,000

Can be written as:

(x - 100)(y - 100)(z - 100) - 10,000(x + y + z) + 1,000,000 = -2,000,000

Now, let's move the constants to the right:

(x - 100)(y - 100)(z - 100) - 10,000(x + y + z) = -2,000,000 - 1,000,000

Which is:

(x - 100)(y - 100)(z - 100) - 10,000(x + y + z) = -3,000,000

Hmm, but we know that x + y + z = 300. So, substituting that in:

(x - 100)(y - 100)(z - 100) - 10,000 * 300 = -3,000,000

Calculates:

(x - 100)(y - 100)(z - 100) - 3,000,000 = -3,000,000

So, (x - 100)(y - 100)(z - 100) = 0

Wait, that's interesting. So, (a - 100)(b - 100)(c - 100) = 0

Which implies that at least one of the terms (a - 100), (b - 100), or (c - 100) must be zero. Therefore, at least one of a, b, c must be equal to 100.

So, this gives me a condition that at least one of a, b, or c is 100. So, the triples (a, b, c) must have at least one variable equal to 100.

So, now, my problem reduces to finding the number of nonnegative integer triples (a, b, c) such that a + b + c = 300 and at least one of a, b, c is 100.

Wait, but I also need to ensure that the second equation holds, which we already used to get this condition. So, perhaps all triples where at least one variable is 100 automatically satisfy the second condition? Or is there more to it?

Wait, no, because when we derived the condition (a - 100)(b - 100)(c - 100) = 0, it was under the assumption that both given equations hold. So, if a triple satisfies both given equations, then it must have at least one variable equal to 100. Conversely, if a triple has at least one variable equal to 100 and satisfies a + b + c = 300, does it automatically satisfy the second equation?

I should check that.

Let me take a triple where, say, a = 100, and a + b + c = 300. So, b + c = 200. Now, let's compute the second equation: a²b + a²c + b²a + b²c + c²a + c²b.

Substituting a = 100:

100²b + 100²c + b²*100 + b²c + c²*100 + c²b

Which is 10,000b + 10,000c + 100b² + b²c + 100c² + c²b

Factor where possible.

Looking at 10,000b + 10,000c = 10,000(b + c) = 10,000*200 = 2,000,000.

Then, 100b² + 100c² = 100(b² + c²). And the remaining terms are b²c + c²b = bc(b + c) = bc*200.

So, the total expression is 2,000,000 + 100(b² + c²) + 200bc.

But since b + c = 200, we can express b² + c² in terms of (b + c)^2 - 2bc = 40,000 - 2bc.

So, substituting back:

2,000,000 + 100*(40,000 - 2bc) + 200bc

Which is 2,000,000 + 4,000,000 - 200bc + 200bc

Notice that the -200bc and +200bc cancel out, so we get 6,000,000.

So, indeed, if a = 100 and b + c = 200, then the second equation is automatically satisfied. Similarly, if b = 100 or c = 100, the same logic applies. So, any triple where at least one variable is 100 and the sum is 300 satisfies both equations. So, our problem reduces to counting such triples.

So, the problem now is: find the number of triples (a, b, c) of nonnegative integers such that a + b + c = 300 and at least one of a, b, c is 100.

So, how do I count these triples?

This is a classic stars and bars problem with inclusion-exclusion. Let me think.

The total number of triples (a, b, c) with a + b + c = 300 is C(300 + 3 - 1, 3 - 1) = C(302, 2) = (302*301)/2 = 45,301.

But we need the number of such triples where at least one variable is 100. So, we can compute the number using inclusion-exclusion.

Let me denote:

A = set of triples where a = 100

B = set of triples where b = 100

C = set of triples where c = 100

We need |A ∪ B ∪ C|.

By inclusion-exclusion principle:

|A ∪ B ∪ C| = |A| + |B| + |C| - |A∩B| - |A∩C| - |B∩C| + |A∩B∩C|

So, let's compute each term.

First, |A|: number of triples where a = 100. Then, b + c = 200. The number of nonnegative integer solutions is C(200 + 2 - 1, 2 - 1) = C(201, 1) = 201.

Similarly, |B| = |C| = 201 each.

Next, |A ∩ B|: number of triples where a = 100 and b = 100. Then, c = 300 - a - b = 100. So, c must be 100. So, the only solution is (100, 100, 100). So, |A ∩ B| = 1.

Similarly, |A ∩ C| and |B ∩ C| are each 1.

Finally, |A ∩ B ∩ C|: number of triples where a = b = c = 100. But 100 + 100 + 100 = 300, so exactly one solution. So, |A ∩ B ∩ C| = 1.

So, putting it all together:

|A ∪ B ∪ C| = |A| + |B| + |C| - |A∩B| - |A∩C| - |B∩C| + |A∩B∩C|

= 201 + 201 + 201 - 1 -1 -1 + 1

Compute step by step:

201 + 201 + 201 = 603

Subtract 1 three times: 603 - 3 = 600

Add 1: 600 + 1 = 601

So, the total number is 601.

Wait, but let me think again. Are these all the solutions? Because when a = 100, b and c can be any nonnegative integers summing to 200. Similarly for b and c. But are there any overlapping cases where two variables are 100? Well, as we saw, |A ∩ B| is 1, as it's the case where all three are 100. Wait, no, when a = 100 and b = 100, then c must be 100 as well, because a + b + c = 300. So, that triple is (100, 100, 100). Similarly, if a = 100 and c = 100, then b must be 100.

So, the intersections of two sets are each a single point.

But wait, let me check the computation again.

Each |A|, |B|, |C| is 201.

Each pairwise intersection (A∩B, A∩C, B∩C) is 1.

The triple intersection is 1.

So, inclusion-exclusion:

3*201 - 3*1 + 1 = 603 - 3 + 1 = 601.

Yes, that's correct.

So, the number of triples is 601.

Wait a second, but let me think if that's correct. So, for each variable being 100, we have 201 solutions, but when two variables are 100, they all collapse to the same point, which is when all three are 100.

Wait, but in our earlier calculation, when a = 100 and b = 100, c has to be 100, so that's only one solution. Similarly for the other intersections.

But let's also think: when we count |A|, which is 201, these include the case where (100, 100, 100), right? Because when a = 100, b can be 100 and c = 100. Similarly, |B| includes (100, 100, 100), and same for |C|.

So, in inclusion-exclusion, when we subtract the pairwise intersections, we are subtracting the cases where two variables are 100, which have been overcounted. But in our problem, the only case where two variables are 100 is when all three are 100, because a + b + c = 300. So, if two variables are 100, the third must be 100 as well. Therefore, the only case where two variables are 100 is when all three are 100.

So, in that case, the pairwise intersections each have exactly one element: the triple (100, 100, 100). So, that's why each |A∩B|, |A∩C|, |B∩C| is 1.

Now, when we apply inclusion-exclusion, we have:

|A ∪ B ∪ C| = |A| + |B| + |C| - |A∩B| - |A∩C| - |B∩C| + |A∩B∩C|

Which is 201 + 201 + 201 - 1 -1 -1 + 1 = 601.

So, the total number is 601.

Wait, but let me think: are there any other cases where variables can be 100 beyond what's already counted? For example, could we have other triples where a = 100 and b = 100 but c is not 100? But that's impossible because a + b = 200, so c must be 100. So, no, all cases where two variables are 100 must have the third also 100.

So, that seems consistent.

Therefore, the total number of triples is 601.

But let me think again about the initial problem. Are there any cases where a, b, or c is 100, but the second equation is not satisfied? But earlier, I showed that if one variable is 100 and the sum is 300, then the second equation is automatically satisfied. So, yes, all these 601 triples satisfy both equations.

Wait, but another thought: are all these 601 triples distinct? For example, when a = 100, and b and c are varying, does that include any duplicates when, say, a = 100 and b = 100, which is the same as c = 100? But in the count, |A| includes all triples where a=100, including the case where b and c are 100. Similarly for |B| and |C|. So, when I apply inclusion-exclusion, I subtract the overlaps where two variables are 100, which only occurs once in each |A|, |B|, |C|. So, the count should be correct.

Therefore, the final answer is 601.

Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make any miscalculations in the inclusion-exclusion. Let me recalculate:

Each |A|, |B|, |C|: 201.

Total for |A| + |B| + |C|: 201 * 3 = 603.

Subtract |A∩B| + |A∩C| + |B∩C|: 1 * 3 = 3. So, 603 - 3 = 600.

Add back |A∩B∩C|: 1. So, 600 + 1 = 601.

Yes, that's correct.

Alternatively, another way to think about it: The number of triples where a=100 is 201. Similarly for b and c. But when a=100 and b=100, that's one triple; same for a=100 and c=100, etc. So, the inclusion-exclusion accounts for these overlaps correctly.

Therefore, the number of triples is 601.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To solve the problem, we analyze the given conditions and use algebraic manipulation and combinatorial counting.

We are given:
1. \(a + b + c = 300\)
2. \(a^2b + a^2c + b^2a + b^2c + c^2a + c^2b = 6,000,000\)

By factoring and substituting, we find that the second equation simplifies to \((a - 100)(b - 100)(c - 100) = 0\). This implies that at least one of \(a\), \(b\), or \(c\) must be 100.

To count the number of valid triples \((a, b, c)\), we use the principle of inclusion-exclusion:
- The number of triples where \(a = 100\) is 201.
- Similarly, for \(b = 100\) and \(c = 100\), each contributes 201 triples.
- Subtract overlaps where two variables are 100, each contributing 1 triple.
- Add back the case where all three variables are 100.

Thus, the total number of valid triples is:
\[
3 \times 201 - 3 \times 1 + 1 = 601
\]

The final answer is \(\boxed{601}\).
