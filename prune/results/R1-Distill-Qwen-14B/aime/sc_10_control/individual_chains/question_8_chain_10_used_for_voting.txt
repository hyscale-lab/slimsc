Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the number of triples of nonnegative integers (a, b, c) that satisfy two conditions: a + b + c = 300 and a²b + a²c + b²a + b²c + c²a + c²b = 6,000,000.

Hmm, let me write down the equations first to get a clearer picture.

1. a + b + c = 300
2. a²b + a²c + b²a + b²c + c²a + c²b = 6,000,000

I need to find the number of nonnegative integer solutions (a, b, c) that satisfy both these equations.

Let me see. The first equation is straightforward—it's the sum of a, b, and c being 300. The second equation is more complicated. It looks like a symmetric expression in a, b, and c. Let me try to factor or simplify that expression.

Looking at the second equation: a²b + a²c + b²a + b²c + c²a + c²b. I notice that each term is a product of two variables where one is squared. So, for example, a²b and a²c both have a squared. Similarly, the terms can be grouped as a²(b + c) + b²(a + c) + c²(a + b).

Let me write that:

a²(b + c) + b²(a + c) + c²(a + b)

Since a + b + c = 300, I can substitute (b + c) with (300 - a), (a + c) with (300 - b), and (a + b) with (300 - c). That should simplify the expression.

So substituting, we get:

a²(300 - a) + b²(300 - b) + c²(300 - c) = 6,000,000.

Let me expand each term:

a²(300 - a) = 300a² - a³
Similarly, b²(300 - b) = 300b² - b³
And c²(300 - c) = 300c² - c³

So putting it all together:

(300a² - a³) + (300b² - b³) + (300c² - c³) = 6,000,000

Combine like terms:

300(a² + b² + c²) - (a³ + b³ + c³) = 6,000,000

Hmm, that's an interesting form. Maybe I can find another equation involving a² + b² + c² and a³ + b³ + c³.

I know that (a + b + c)^2 = a² + b² + c² + 2(ab + bc + ca). Since a + b + c = 300, (300)^2 = 90,000.

So, 90,000 = a² + b² + c² + 2(ab + bc + ca)

Let me denote S1 = a + b + c = 300

S2 = ab + bc + ca

S3 = abc

But wait, I don't know S3 yet, but perhaps I can express a² + b² + c² in terms of S1 and S2.

From the identity:

a² + b² + c² = S1² - 2S2 = 300² - 2S2 = 90,000 - 2S2.

So, going back to the second equation:

300(a² + b² + c²) - (a³ + b³ + c³) = 6,000,000

Let me plug in a² + b² + c² as 90,000 - 2S2:

300(90,000 - 2S2) - (a³ + b³ + c³) = 6,000,000

Calculating 300*(90,000 - 2S2):

300*90,000 = 27,000,000

300*(-2S2) = -600 S2

So, the equation becomes:

27,000,000 - 600 S2 - (a³ + b³ + c³) = 6,000,000

Let me subtract 6,000,000 from both sides:

27,000,000 - 6,000,000 - 600 S2 - (a³ + b³ + c³) = 0

Which simplifies to:

21,000,000 - 600 S2 - (a³ + b³ + c³) = 0

So,

a³ + b³ + c³ = 21,000,000 - 600 S2

Hmm, I need another way to express a³ + b³ + c³. I recall that there's an identity for the sum of cubes:

a³ + b³ + c³ = (a + b + c)^3 - 3(a + b + c)(ab + bc + ca) + 3abc

Yes, that's correct. Let me write that down.

So,

a³ + b³ + c³ = S1³ - 3 S1 S2 + 3 S3

Substituting S1 = 300,

a³ + b³ + c³ = 300³ - 3*300*S2 + 3 S3

Calculate 300³: 300*300=90,000; 90,000*300=27,000,000

So,

a³ + b³ + c³ = 27,000,000 - 900 S2 + 3 S3

Now, from the earlier equation, we have:

a³ + b³ + c³ = 21,000,000 - 600 S2

So, equate the two expressions:

27,000,000 - 900 S2 + 3 S3 = 21,000,000 - 600 S2

Let me bring all terms to one side:

27,000,000 - 900 S2 + 3 S3 - 21,000,000 + 600 S2 = 0

Simplify:

(27,000,000 - 21,000,000) + (-900 S2 + 600 S2) + 3 S3 = 0

Which gives:

6,000,000 - 300 S2 + 3 S3 = 0

Divide both sides by 3:

2,000,000 - 100 S2 + S3 = 0

So,

S3 = 100 S2 - 2,000,000

Hmm, so now I have S3 expressed in terms of S2.

From earlier, I had another equation from S1² = 90,000 = a² + b² + c² + 2 S2.

Wait, but I also know that a² + b² + c² = 90,000 - 2 S2, from the identity.

But perhaps I can find another equation involving S2 and S3. Alternatively, I can think about the fact that a, b, c are nonnegative integers and perhaps find constraints on S2 and S3.

Wait, another thought: Since a, b, c are nonnegative integers adding up to 300, perhaps we can model this using symmetric polynomials or even think about the problem in terms of variables x, y, z where x = a, y = b, z = c, but I don't know if that'll help.

Alternatively, maybe I can think of the original equation in terms of symmetric sums.

Wait, let's see. So, I have:

S3 = 100 S2 - 2,000,000

But S3 is abc, and S2 is ab + bc + ca.

So, perhaps I can find a way to relate S2 and S3 given that a + b + c = 300.

Wait, another idea: Maybe consider that the variables a, b, c are nonnegative integers, so perhaps they can be 0 or positive integers. But since they are symmetric, maybe some of them are equal or have specific relations.

Alternatively, perhaps I can consider the problem as variables a, b, c being the roots of a cubic equation. Because in symmetric polynomial terms, if a, b, c are roots of the cubic equation x³ - S1 x² + S2 x - S3 = 0.

So, the cubic equation would be:

x³ - 300 x² + S2 x - S3 = 0

But from earlier, S3 = 100 S2 - 2,000,000.

So, substituting S3 into the cubic equation:

x³ - 300 x² + S2 x - (100 S2 - 2,000,000) = 0

Simplify:

x³ - 300 x² + S2 x - 100 S2 + 2,000,000 = 0

Factor terms involving S2:

x³ - 300 x² + S2 (x - 100) + 2,000,000 = 0

Hmm, not sure if that helps directly, but maybe I can find specific values for S2 that make this equation have integer roots.

Wait, since a, b, c are nonnegative integers, they must satisfy the cubic equation I just wrote, so the roots a, b, c must be integers. So perhaps I can think about this cubic equation having integer roots, which would impose some conditions on S2.

Alternatively, maybe I can think of the cubic equation as:

x³ - 300 x² + S2 x + (2,000,000 - 100 S2) = 0

But I'm not making much progress here. Maybe I should approach the problem differently.

Let me recall that a, b, c are nonnegative integers summing to 300. So perhaps I can consider cases where two variables are equal or all three are equal.

Wait, let's see. Suppose that two variables are equal, say a = b. Then, since a + b + c = 300, we have 2a + c = 300. So c = 300 - 2a.

Then, substituting into the second equation:

a²b + a²c + b²a + b²c + c²a + c²b = 6,000,000

Since a = b, this becomes:

a³ + a²c + a³ + a²c + c²a + c²a

Simplify:

2a³ + 2a²c + 2a c²

Factor:

2(a³ + a²c + a c²) = 6,000,000

Divide both sides by 2:

a³ + a²c + a c² = 3,000,000

Since c = 300 - 2a, substitute:

a³ + a²(300 - 2a) + a(300 - 2a)² = 3,000,000

Let me compute each term:

First term: a³

Second term: a²(300 - 2a) = 300 a² - 2a³

Third term: a*(300 - 2a)². Let's expand (300 - 2a)^2 first.

(300 - 2a)^2 = 90,000 - 1200 a + 4a²

So third term: a*(90,000 - 1200 a + 4a²) = 90,000 a - 1200 a² + 4 a³

Now, combining all three terms:

a³ + (300 a² - 2a³) + (90,000 a - 1200 a² + 4a³) = 3,000,000

Combine like terms:

a³ - 2a³ + 4a³ = (1 -2 +4)a³ = 3a³

300a² - 1200a² = (-900 a²)

90,000 a remains.

So overall:

3a³ - 900a² + 90,000 a = 3,000,000

Divide both sides by 3:

a³ - 300 a² + 30,000 a = 1,000,000

Bring all terms to left:

a³ - 300 a² + 30,000 a - 1,000,000 = 0

Hmm, this is a cubic equation in a. Maybe I can find integer roots for this equation.

Let me try plugging in some integer values for a. Since a is a nonnegative integer and c = 300 - 2a must also be nonnegative, a can be from 0 to 150.

Let me try a = 100:

100³ - 300*(100)^2 + 30,000*100 - 1,000,000

= 1,000,000 - 3,000,000 + 3,000,000 - 1,000,000 = 0

So a=100 is a root.

Therefore, (a - 100) is a factor. Let's perform polynomial division or factor it.

Divide a³ - 300 a² + 30,000 a - 1,000,000 by (a - 100).

Using synthetic division:

Coefficients: 1 | -300 | 30,000 | -1,000,000

Bring down 1.

Multiply by 100: 1 * 100 = 100

Add to next coefficient: -300 + 100 = -200

Multiply by 100: -200 * 100 = -20,000

Add to next coefficient: 30,000 + (-20,000) = 10,000

Multiply by 100: 10,000 *100=1,000,000

Add to last coefficient: -1,000,000 +1,000,000 = 0

So the polynomial factors as (a - 100)(a² - 200a + 10,000) = 0

Now, set a² - 200a + 10,000 = 0

Use quadratic formula:

a = [200 ± sqrt(200² - 4*1*10,000)] / 2

= [200 ± sqrt(40,000 - 40,000)] / 2

= [200 ± 0]/2 = 100

So, the equation has a double root at a=100, so the cubic factors as (a - 100)^3 = 0

Thus, the only real solution is a=100, with multiplicity 3.

So, in the case where a = b = 100, then c = 300 - 2a = 300 - 200 = 100.

So, the triple is (100, 100, 100). That's one solution where all three are equal.

But wait, I was considering the case where a = b. There could be other cases where a, b, c are not all equal, but perhaps two are equal and the third is different.

Wait, but in this case, when a = b, the only solution is a = b = c = 100. So, in this scenario, no other solutions where two are equal but the third is different.

But maybe I should consider other cases where two variables are equal but not necessarily a = b.

Wait, no, because if I set a = b, I get only a = b = c = 100 as a solution. If I set a = c, would that give a different solution?

Let me try a = c.

So, a = c, so 2a + b = 300 => b = 300 - 2a

Plug into the second equation:

a²b + a²c + b²a + b²c + c²a + c²b

Since a = c,

= a²b + a^3 + b²a + b a² + a^3 + b²a

Wait, let me compute each term:

a²b + a²c = a²b + a²a = a²b + a³

b²a + b²c = b²a + b²a = 2 b² a

c²a + c²b = a²a + a²b = a³ + a²b

Wait, perhaps I should compute step by step:

Expression:

a²b + a²c + b²a + b²c + c²a + c²b

With a = c:

a²b + a²a + b²a + b²a + a²a + a²b

Simplify each term:

a²b + a³ + b²a + b²a + a^3 + a²b

Combine like terms:

a²b appears 3 times: 3a²b

a^3 appears 2 times: 2a³

b²a appears 2 times: 2a b²

So total expression:

3a²b + 2a³ + 2a b²

Set equal to 6,000,000:

3a²b + 2a³ + 2a b² = 6,000,000

But b = 300 - 2a, so substitute:

3a²(300 - 2a) + 2a³ + 2a(300 - 2a)^2 = 6,000,000

Compute each term:

First term: 3a²(300 - 2a) = 900a² - 6a³

Second term: 2a³

Third term: 2a*(300 - 2a)^2.

First compute (300 - 2a)^2 = 90,000 - 1200a +4a²

Multiply by 2a: 180,000 a - 2400 a² + 8 a³

Now, combine all terms:

900a² -6a³ + 2a³ + 180,000a -2400a² +8a³

Combine like terms:

a³: (-6a³ + 2a³ +8a³) = 4a³

a²: (900a² -2400a²) = -1500a²

a terms: 180,000a

So overall:

4a³ -1500a² + 180,000a = 6,000,000

Divide both sides by 4:

a³ - 375a² + 45,000a = 1,500,000

Bring all terms to left:

a³ - 375a² + 45,000a - 1,500,000 = 0

Hmm, another cubic equation. Let me try to see if a=100 is a root.

Compute:

100³ - 375*(100)^2 +45,000*100 -1,500,000

= 1,000,000 - 375*10,000 +4,500,000 -1,500,000

=1,000,000 -3,750,000 +4,500,000 -1,500,000

= (1,000,000 +4,500,000) - (3,750,000 +1,500,000)

=5,500,000 -5,250,000=250,000 ≠0

So, a=100 isn't a root here. Let me try a=50.

Compute:

50³ -375*(50)^2 +45,000*50 -1,500,000

=125,000 -375*2500 +2,250,000 -1,500,000

=125,000 -937,500 +2,250,000 -1,500,000

= (125,000 +2,250,000) - (937,500 +1,500,000)

=2,375,000 -2,437,500= -62,500 ≠0

Not a root. Maybe a=200?

But since b=300-2a must be nonnegative, a can be at most 150.

Let me try a=150:

150³ -375*(150)^2 +45,000*150 -1,500,000

=3,375,000 -375*22,500 +6,750,000 -1,500,000

=3,375,000 -8,437,500 +6,750,000 -1,500,000

= (3,375,000 +6,750,000) - (8,437,500 +1,500,000)

=10,125,000 -9,937,500=187,500 ≠0

Not a root. Maybe a=125.

125³=1,953,125

375*(125)^2=375*15,625=5,859,375

45,000*125=5,625,000

So,

1,953,125 -5,859,375 +5,625,000 -1,500,000

= (1,953,125 +5,625,000) - (5,859,375 +1,500,000)

=7,578,125 -7,359,375=218,750 ≠0

Not a root. Hmm, maybe a=100 is not a solution here.

Alternatively, perhaps I can factor this cubic equation.

Wait, let's write the equation again:

a³ - 375a² +45,000a -1,500,000 = 0

Let me factor out an 'a' first:

a(a² - 375a +45,000) -1,500,000 =0

Hmm, that doesn't seem helpful. Alternatively, maybe try grouping terms.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use rational root theorem. The possible rational roots are factors of 1,500,000 divided by factors of 1 (the leading coefficient). So possible integer roots are divisors of 1,500,000.

But that's a lot of possibilities. Maybe try a=50:

Wait I tried a=50, got -62,500, not zero.

How about a=100: got 250,000.

a= 25:

25³=15,625

375*(25)^2=375*625=234,375

45,000*25=1,125,000

So,

15,625 -234,375 +1,125,000 -1,500,000

= (15,625 +1,125,000) - (234,375 +1,500,000)

=1,140,625 -1,734,375= -593,750 ≠0

Not a root.

This is getting tedious. Maybe there are no integer roots besides a=100 in this case, meaning that the only solution where two variables are equal is when all three are 100.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider the case where all three variables are distinct.

Wait, but that might complicate things. Maybe another approach would be better.

Let me think back to the original problem and see if I can find another way.

We had:

a + b + c = 300

and

a²b + a²c + b²a + b²c + c²a + c²b = 6,000,000

Let me try to factor this expression differently.

Notice that:

a²b + a²c = a²(b + c) = a²(300 - a)

Similarly,

b²a + b²c = b²(300 - b)

c²a + c²b = c²(300 - c)

So, the second equation becomes:

a²(300 - a) + b²(300 - b) + c²(300 - c) = 6,000,000

Which is the same as:

300(a² + b² + c²) - (a³ + b³ + c³) = 6,000,000

As we had earlier. So, from that, we had:

a³ + b³ + c³ = 300(a² + b² + c²) - 6,000,000

Wait, but from the earlier identity, we had:

a³ + b³ + c³ = 27,000,000 - 900 S2 + 3 S3

And from another equation, we had:

a³ + b³ + c³ = 21,000,000 - 600 S2

So equating, we got:

27,000,000 -900 S2 +3 S3 = 21,000,000 -600 S2

Which led to:

6,000,000 - 300 S2 + 3 S3 = 0 => S3 = 100 S2 - 2,000,000

Hmm, so S3 = abc = 100 S2 - 2,000,000.

Now, since a, b, c are nonnegative integers, S3 is nonnegative.

So,

100 S2 - 2,000,000 ≥ 0 => S2 ≥ 20,000.

Also, since S2 is ab + bc + ca, with a + b + c = 300.

The maximum possible value of S2 occurs when two variables are as large as possible, and the third is as small as possible. For example, when one variable is 300 and the others are 0, S2 = 0. But that's the minimum.

Wait, no, actually, the maximum of S2 occurs when two variables are as large as possible while the third is as small as possible. Wait, actually, for fixed a + b + c, the maximum of ab + bc + ca is when two variables are equal and as large as possible, and the third is as small as possible.

Wait, more accurately, for a fixed sum, ab + bc + ca is maximized when the variables are as equal as possible.

Wait, no, actually, the maximum occurs when two variables are equal and the third is as small as possible.

Wait, let me think. Suppose a = b = x, then c = 300 - 2x.

Then S2 = ab + bc + ca = x² + x(300 - 2x) + x(300 - 2x) = x² + 600x - 4x² = -3x² + 600x

The maximum of this quadratic occurs at x = -b/(2a) = -600/(2*(-3)) )= 600/6 = 100.

So, maximum S2 when x=100, which gives S2 = -3*(100)^2 +600*100 = -30,000 +60,000=30,000.

So, S2 can range from 0 (if two variables are 150 and the third is 0, but wait, no, with a + b + c =300, if one variable is 300, others are 0, then S2 =0. If two variables are 150 and one is 0, S2=150*150 +150*0 +150*0=22,500. Hmm, so 22,500 is another possible S2.

Wait, earlier when I considered a = b =100, S2 = ab + bc + ca = 100*100 +100*100 +100*100 = 30,000. So, that's the maximum.

So, S2 can range from 0 up to 30,000.

But from earlier, we have S3 = 100 S2 - 2,000,000. Since S3 must be nonnegative, we have 100 S2 ≥2,000,000 => S2 ≥20,000.

So, S2 must be between 20,000 and 30,000.

So, 20,000 ≤ S2 ≤30,000.

But S2 is an integer (since a, b, c are integers), so S2 ranges from 20,000 to 30,000.

Wait, but that's 10,001 possibilities, which seems a lot. But perhaps we can find the possible integer values of S2 and S3 that fit.

But maybe we can find another equation involving S2 and S3.

Wait, let me think about the cubic equation whose roots are a, b, c.

The cubic equation is x³ - 300 x² + S2 x - S3 = 0.

Given that S3 =100 S2 -2,000,000, the equation becomes:

x³ -300 x² + S2 x - (100 S2 -2,000,000) =0

Which simplifies to:

x³ -300x² + S2 x -100 S2 +2,000,000 = 0

Hmm. Maybe we can factor this expression.

Let me try to group terms:

x³ -300x² + S2(x -100) +2,000,000 =0

Hmm, not sure. Alternatively, perhaps try to write it as:

x³ -300x² + (S2)(x - 100) + 2,000,000 =0

Alternatively, perhaps consider that since a, b, c are integers, the cubic must have integer roots, so perhaps we can find possible factors.

But this might not be straightforward. Alternatively, perhaps I can think of the equation as:

x³ -300x² + S2 x -100 S2 +2,000,000 =0

Which is:

x³ -300x² + S2 (x -100) +2,000,000 =0

Hmm, maybe if I set x =100, then:

100³ -300*(100)^2 + S2*(100 -100) +2,000,000

=1,000,000 -3,000,000 +0 +2,000,000 =0

So, x=100 is a root. So, (x -100) is a factor.

So, let's perform polynomial division to factor this cubic.

Divide x³ -300x² + S2 x -100 S2 +2,000,000 by (x -100).

Using synthetic division:

Write coefficients: 1 | -300 | S2 | (-100 S2 +2,000,000)

Using x=100 as the root.

Bring down 1.

Multiply by 100: 1*100=100

Add to next coefficient: -300 +100= -200

Multiply by 100: -200*100= -20,000

Add to next coefficient: S2 + (-20,000) = S2 -20,000

Multiply by 100: (S2 -20,000)*100=100 S2 -2,000,000

Add to last coefficient: (-100 S2 +2,000,000) + (100 S2 -2,000,000) =0

So, the cubic factors as (x -100)(x² -200x + (S2 -20,000)) =0

Thus, the cubic equation becomes:

(x -100)(x² -200x + (S2 -20,000))=0

So, the other two roots are the roots of x² -200x + (S2 -20,000) =0

For these roots to be integers, the discriminant must be a perfect square.

Discriminant D = (200)^2 -4*1*(S2 -20,000) =40,000 -4(S2 -20,000) =40,000 -4 S2 +80,000=120,000 -4 S2

This must be a perfect square, say k².

So,

120,000 -4 S2 =k²

Which can be rewritten as:

4 S2 =120,000 -k²

So,

S2 = (120,000 -k²)/4 =30,000 - (k²)/4

Since S2 must be an integer, k² must be divisible by 4, so k must be even.

Let me set k=2m, where m is an integer.

Then,

S2=30,000 - (4 m²)/4 =30,000 - m²

So,

S2=30,000 - m²

But from earlier, S2 must be ≥20,000, so:

30,000 -m² ≥20,000 → m² ≤10,000 → |m| ≤100.

Since k=2m and k² must be non-negative, m can range from -100 to 100, but since m² is same for m and -m, we can consider m from 0 to 100.

Also, since k² must be ≤120,000, which is satisfied as m² ≤10,000, so k²=4m² ≤40,000, which is less than 120,000.

So, the possible values of m are 0,1,2,...,100.

Thus, for each m from 0 to 100, we have S2=30,000 -m².

Then, the quadratic equation x² -200x + (S2 -20,000) = x² -200x + (30,000 -m² -20,000) =x² -200x +10,000 -m²=0

So, the roots of this quadratic are:

x = [200 ± sqrt(40,000 -4*(10,000 -m²)}]/2

Simplify discriminant:

sqrt(40,000 -40,000 +4m²) = sqrt(4m²)=2|m|

Since m is nonnegative (we considered m from 0 to100), this is 2m.

So, the roots are:

x = [200 ± 2m]/2 =100 ± m

Therefore, the roots are 100 + m and 100 - m.

Thus, the three roots of the cubic equation are 100, 100 +m, 100 -m.

But since a, b, c are nonnegative integers, each root must be ≥0.

So, 100 -m ≥0 → m ≤100.

Which is already satisfied as m ranges up to 100.

So, the three variables are 100, 100 + m, and 100 -m.

But since a, b, c are nonnegative integers, and m can be from 0 to 100, we need to consider the possible values of m such that all three roots are nonnegative.

But m can be 0,1,...,100.

Now, when m=0, all roots are 100, so a=b=c=100, as before.

For m≥1, the roots are 100 -m, 100, 100 +m.

But 100 -m must be ≥0, so m ≤100.

So, for each m from 0 to100, we get a solution where a=100 -m, b=100, c=100 +m. But since the variables are symmetric, any permutation of these would also be a solution.

Wait, but I need to count all possible triples (a, b, c) that satisfy the conditions, considering permutations.

So, for each m, the roots are 100 -m, 100, 100 +m.

But wait, let's check the sum: (100 -m) +100 + (100 +m)=300. Correct.

So, for each m from 0 to100, we get a unique set of roots up to permutation.

Now, when m=0, all three variables are 100, so only one triple (100,100,100).

When m ≥1, the variables are 100 -m, 100, 100 +m.

But these can be arranged in any order. So, how many permutations are there?

If all three are distinct, which is when m≠0, the number of permutations is 6 (3! =6). But if two are equal and one different, which is when m=0, only 1 permutation.

Wait, but in our case, for m≠0, the three numbers are 100 -m, 100, 100 +m, which are all distinct as long as m≠0. So for each m from1 to100, we have 6 different triples.

Wait, but when m=50, for example, 100 -50=50, 100, 150. These are distinct, so 6 permutations.

But let me check for m=100: 100 -100=0, 100, 200. These are distinct, so 6 permutations.

So, for m from1 to100, each gives 6 distinct triples.

Thus, the total number of solutions would be:

For m=0: 1 solution.

For m=1 to100: 100 m's, each contributing 6 solutions. So 100 *6=600.

Thus, total solutions:1 +600=601.

Wait, but let me think again. Are all these permutations valid? Because when m=0, we have all variables equal, so only one triple.

But when m=1, we have variables 99,100,101. These can be arranged in any order, giving 6 different triples.

Similarly, for m=2, variables 98,100,102, again 6 permutations.

So, for each m from1 to100, we have 6 distinct triples.

Thus, total number of triples would be 1 + 100 *6=601.

Wait, but let me double-check this.

Wait, but in the problem statement, the variables are nonnegative integers, so when m=100, one of the variables is 0, which is allowed.

But wait, the problem is to count the number of triples (a, b, c) where a, b, c are nonnegative integers satisfying the two given equations.

Each m from 0 to100 gives a distinct set of variables, and for each m≠0, the variables are distinct and can be permuted in any order.

But wait, when m=0, the variables are all 100, so only one triple.

But for each m from1 to100, we have permutations of (100 -m,100,100 +m), which are 6 distinct triples.

Hence, the total number of triples would be 1 + 100 *6=601.

Wait, but let me check for m=0: (100,100,100) is one solution.

For m=1, variables are 99,100,101. The number of distinct permutations is 6.

Similarly, for m=2, variables are98,100,102: 6 permutations.

And so on, up to m=100, where variables are0,100,200:6 permutations.

Thus, 100 values of m from1 to100, each contributing 6 triples, plus 1 triple for m=0, giving total of 601.

Wait, but is this correct? Let me see.

Wait, but I'm assuming that for each m, the variables are distinct and can be arranged in 6 ways. But when m=50, for example, the variables are50,100,150: all distinct, yes.

But what about when m=100: variables are0,100,200: yes, all distinct, so 6 permutations.

So, that seems correct.

But wait, let me think about whether each m indeed gives distinct variables. For m from1 to100, 100 -m and 100 +m are distinct as long as m≠0, which is the case. So, for each m from1 to100, the three numbers are distinct, so each m contributes 6 triples.

Thus, the total number of solutions is 1 (for m=0) +6*100=601.

Wait, but let's test m=1:

Variables are99,100,101. Plugging into the equations:

a + b + c=99+100+101=300: correct.

Compute a²b +a²c +b²a +b²c +c²a +c²b.

Compute each term:

a=99, b=100, c=101.

a²b=99²*100=9801*100=980,100

a²c=99²*101=9801*101=990, 981? Wait, let me compute:

9801 *101=9801*(100+1)=980100 +9801=990, 9801 +9801= 980100+9801= 990, 9801 +9801= 990, 9801? Wait, perhaps better to compute 9801*101:

=9801*(100 +1)=980100 +9801=990, 9801 +9801=990, 9801? Wait, that can't be right. Wait, 980100 +9801=990, 9801?

Wait, no, 980100 +9801=989,901.

Similarly, compute each term:

a²b=99²*100=9801*100=980,100

a²c=9801*101=989,901

b²a=100²*99=10,000*99=990,000

b²c=10,000*101=1,010,000

c²a=101²*99=10,201*99=1,009,899

c²b=10,201*100=1,020,100

Now, sum all these:

980,100 +989,901 =1,970,001

+990,000 =2,960,001

+1,010,000=3,970,001

+1,009,899=4,979,900

+1,020,100=6,000,000

Yes, it adds up correctly.

Similarly, for m=100:

Variables are0,100,200.

Compute a²b +a²c +b²a +b²c +c²a +c²b.

With a=0, b=100, c=200.

a²b=0

a²c=0

b²a=10,000*0=0

b²c=10,000*200=2,000,000

c²a=40,000*0=0

c²b=40,000*100=4,000,000

Sum: 0 +0 +0 +2,000,000 +0 +4,000,000 =6,000,000: correct.

So, the approach seems valid.

So, each m from1 to100 gives 6 distinct triples, and m=0 gives 1 triple. So total is 601.

Wait, but wait a second. What about the case where m=0, which gives a triple where all are 100, but if we permute them, we still get the same triple. So, only 1 solution.

But for m=1 to100, each gives 6 distinct triples because the three numbers are distinct.

Hence, the total number of solutions is 1 + 100*6=601.

Wait, but let me think again. The variables are nonnegative integers, so when m=100, one of them is zero, which is allowed. So, all 6 permutations are allowed as long as variables are nonnegative.

Thus, I think 601 is the correct answer.

But wait, let me check for m=50:

Variables are50,100,150.

Compute the sum:50+100+150=300: correct.

Compute the second equation:

a²b +a²c +b²a +b²c +c²a +c²b.

a=50, b=100, c=150.

a²b=2500*100=250,000

a²c=2500*150=375,000

b²a=10,000*50=500,000

b²c=10,000*150=1,500,000

c²a=22500*50=1,125,000

c²b=22500*100=2,250,000

Sum:

250,000 +375,000=625,000

+500,000=1,125,000

+1,500,000=2,625,000

+1,125,000=3,750,000

+2,250,000=6,000,000: correct.

So, that works.

Thus, the total number of triples is 601.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The number of triples is 601.

**Step-by-Step Explanation and Answer:**

We are to find the number of triples of nonnegative integers \((a, b, c)\) satisfying:
1. \(a + b + c = 300\)
2. \(a^2b + a^2c + b^2a + b^2c + c^2a + c^2b = 6,000,000\)

### Step 1: Simplify the Second Equation
The second equation can be rewritten as:
\[
a^2(b + c) + b^2(a + c) + c^2(a + b)
\]
Since \(a + b + c = 300\), we substitute \(b + c = 300 - a\), \(a + c = 300 - b\), and \(a + b = 300 - c\):
\[
a^2(300 - a) + b^2(300 - b) + c^2(300 - c) = 6,000,000
\]
Expanding each term:
\[
300a^2 - a^3 + 300b^2 - b^3 + 300c^2 - c^3 = 6,000,000
\]
Simplify:
\[
300(a^2 + b^2 + c^2) - (a^3 + b^3 + c^3) = 6,000,000
\]

### Step 2: Use Symmetric Sums
Let \(S_1 = a + b + c = 300\), \(S_2 = ab + bc + ca\), and \(S_3 = abc\). From the identity:
\[
(a + b + c)^2 = a^2 + b^2 + c^2 + 2(ab + bc + ca)
\]
We have:
\[
a^2 + b^2 + c^2 = S_1^2 - 2S_2 = 90,000 - 2S_2
\]
Substituting into the second equation:
\[
300(90,000 - 2S_2) - (a^3 + b^3 + c^3) = 6,000,000
\]
Simplify:
\[
27,000,000 - 600S_2 - (a^3 + b^3 + c^3) = 6,000,000
\]
\[
a^3 + b^3 + c^3 = 21,000,000 - 600S_2
\]
Using the identity for the sum of cubes:
\[
a^3 + b^3 + c^3 = S_1^3 - 3S_1S_2 + 3S_3
\]
Substitute \(S_1 = 300\):
\[
21,000,000 - 600S_2 = 27,000,000 - 900S_2 + 3S_3
\]
Simplify:
\[
6,000,000 - 300S_2 + 3S_3 = 0 \quad \Rightarrow \quad S_3 = 100S_2 - 2,000,000
\]

### Step 3: Solve for \(S_2\)
Since \(a, b, c\) are nonnegative integers, \(S_3 \geq 0\):
\[
100S_2 - 2,000,000 \geq 0 \quad \Rightarrow \quad S_2 \geq 20,000
\]
Also, \(S_2 \leq 30,000\) (maximum when \(a = b = c = 100\)).

### Step 4: Factor the Cubic Equation
The cubic equation with roots \(a, b, c\) is:
\[
x^3 - 300x^2 + S_2x - S_3 = 0
\]
Substitute \(S_3 = 100S_2 - 2,000,000\):
\[
x^3 - 300x^2 + S_2x - (100S_2 - 2,000,000) = 0
\]
Factor as:
\[
(x - 100)(x^2 - 200x + (S_2 - 20,000)) = 0
\]
The quadratic equation \(x^2 - 200x + (S_2 - 20,000) = 0\) has roots:
\[
x = 100 \pm m
\]
where \(m\) is an integer such that \(m^2 = 10,000 - (S_2 - 20,000)\).

### Step 5: Determine Possible Values of \(m\)
From \(S_2 = 30,000 - m^2\), \(m\) ranges from 0 to 100. For each \(m\):
- If \(m = 0\), \(a = b = c = 100\) (1 solution).
- If \(m \neq 0\), the roots are \(100 - m, 100, 100 + m\), which can be permuted in 6 ways.

### Step 6: Count the Solutions
- \(m = 0\): 1 solution.
- \(m = 1\) to \(100\): \(100 \times 6 = 600\) solutions.

Total solutions: \(1 + 600 = 601\).

### Final Answer:
\[
\boxed{601}
\]
