Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the radius squared of the smallest sphere that can contain any rectangular box from a set B. The set B consists of boxes with a fixed surface area of 54 and a volume of 23. The answer needs to be in the form of a fraction p/q, where p and q are coprime, and then find p + q.

Hmm, I remember that the smallest sphere that can contain a rectangular box must have a diameter equal to the space diagonal of the box. So, the radius would be half of that space diagonal. Therefore, if I can find the maximum possible space diagonal among all boxes in set B, then I can find the radius of the sphere.

Wait, but all boxes in B have the same surface area and volume. So, I need to find the box with the maximum space diagonal given these constraints. Alternatively, maybe the space diagonal is fixed? No, that doesn't seem right because for a given surface area and volume, the shape can vary, which would change the space diagonal.

So, the problem reduces to optimizing the space diagonal of a rectangular box given the constraints on surface area and volume. Since I need the maximum space diagonal, this sounds like a constrained optimization problem. I can probably use Lagrange multipliers for this.

Let me denote the dimensions of the box as x, y, z. Then, the surface area S is given by:

S = 2(xy + yz + zx) = 54

And the volume V is:

V = xyz = 23

I need to maximize the space diagonal D, which is sqrt(x² + y² + z²). Therefore, maximizing D is equivalent to maximizing D² = x² + y² + z².

So, my objective function is f(x, y, z) = x² + y² + z².

Constraints are:

g(x, y, z) = 2(xy + yz + zx) - 54 = 0

h(x, y, z) = xyz - 23 = 0

Since I have two constraints, I might need to use Lagrange multipliers with two constraints. The method involves setting up the gradient of f equal to a linear combination of gradients of g and h.

The Lagrangian would be:

L = x² + y² + z² - λ(2(xy + yz + zx) - 54) - μ(xyz - 23)

Wait, is that right? Let me think. The standard form is ∇f = λ∇g + μ∇h. So, the Lagrangian is L = f - λg - μh, right? Or is it L = f + λg + μh? Wait, actually, the sign depends on how you set it up. Since the constraints are g = 0 and h = 0, the Lagrangian is f - λ(g) - μ(h). So, when taking partial derivatives, we set ∇L = 0.

So, let me write the Lagrangian as:

L = x² + y² + z² - λ(2xy + 2yz + 2zx - 54) - μ(xyz - 23)

Wait, no, hold on. The constraint g is 2(xy + yz + zx) = 54, so g = 2xy + 2yz + 2zx - 54. So, actually, that's correct.

Now, taking partial derivatives with respect to x, y, z, λ, μ.

Partial derivative with respect to x:

dL/dx = 2x - λ(2y + 2z) - μ(yz) = 0

Similarly, dL/dy = 2y - λ(2x + 2z) - μ(xz) = 0

dL/dz = 2z - λ(2x + 2y) - μ(xy) = 0

And the constraints:

2(xy + yz + zx) = 54

xyz = 23

So, now we have a system of equations:

1. 2x - 2λ(y + z) - μyz = 0

2. 2y - 2λ(x + z) - μxz = 0

3. 2z - 2λ(x + y) - μxy = 0

4. 2(xy + yz + zx) = 54

5. xyz = 23

Hmm, this system of equations looks symmetric, which suggests that maybe the optimal box is a cube? Let me check if that's possible.

If x = y = z, then the surface area would be 6x² = 54 ⇒ x² = 9 ⇒ x = 3.

Then the volume would be 3³ = 27. But in our problem, the volume is 23, which is less than 27. So, the box isn't a cube, but perhaps is close to a cube? Or maybe two sides are equal, but the third is different. Maybe it's a square prism or something.

Alternatively, perhaps the maximum space diagonal occurs when two variables are equal. Let me assume x = y ≠ z. Then, we can reduce the problem to two variables.

Let me set x = y. Then, let's denote x = y, so we have dimensions x, x, z.

Now, the surface area becomes 2(x² + xz + xz) = 2x² + 4xz = 54.

Divide both sides by 2: x² + 2xz = 27.

The volume is x² z = 23.

We can solve for z from the volume: z = 23 / x².

Substitute into the surface area equation:

x² + 2x*(23 / x²) = 27 ⇒ x² + (46 / x) = 27.

Multiply both sides by x:

x³ + 46 = 27x ⇒ x³ - 27x + 46 = 0.

Hmm, solving this cubic equation. Let me see if it has rational roots using Rational Root Theorem. The possible rational roots are factors of 46 over 1, so ±1, ±2, ±23, ±46.

Testing x = 2: 8 - 54 + 46 = 0. Yes! So, x=2 is a root.

So, factor out (x - 2):

Using polynomial division or synthetic division.

Coefficients: 1 (x³), 0 (x²), -27 (x), 46.

Using synthetic division for root x=2:

Bring down 1.

Multiply 1*2=2, add to next coefficient: 0 + 2=2.

Multiply 2*2=4, add to next coefficient: -27 +4 = -23.

Multiply -23*2= -46, add to last term: 46 + (-46) = 0. Perfect.

So, the cubic factors as (x - 2)(x² + 2x -23) = 0.

So, the other roots are solutions to x² + 2x -23 = 0.

Using quadratic formula: x = [-2 ± sqrt(4 + 92)] / 2 = [-2 ± sqrt(96)] / 2 = [-2 ± 4*sqrt(6)] / 2 = -1 ± 2*sqrt(6).

Since x must be positive, the roots are x=2, x= -1 + 2√6 ≈ -1 + 4.898 ≈ 3.898.

So, possible x values are 2 and approximately 3.898. Let's check which one is valid.

If x=2, then z=23/(2²)=23/4=5.75.

Then, the surface area is 2*(2² + 2*5.75 + 2*5.75) = 2*(4 + 11.5 + 11.5) = 2*(27) = 54. Correct.

If x= -1 + 2√6 ≈3.898, then z=23/(x²). Let me compute x²: ( -1 + 2√6 )² = 1 -4√6 + 24 = 25 -4√6 ≈25 -9.798≈15.202. Then, z≈23 /15.202≈1.513.

Check surface area: 2*(x² + x z + x z) = 2*(15.202 + 2*3.898*1.513). Let me compute 3.898*1.513≈5.901. So, 2*(15.202 + 2*5.901) = 2*(15.202 +11.802)= 2*(27.004)=54.008. Close enough, considering rounding errors.

So, both x=2 and x≈3.898 are valid solutions when x=y.

So, now, compute the space diagonal for both cases.

Case 1: x=2, z=5.75.

Space diagonal squared is x² + y² + z² = 2² + 2² +5.75² = 4 +4 + 33.0625 = 41.0625. So, radius squared would be 41.0625 /4 = 10.265625. Wait, no, wait. Wait, space diagonal is sqrt(x² + y² + z²), so radius is half that, so radius squared is (sqrt(x²+y²+z²)/2)^2 = (x² + y² + z²)/4.

Wait, but in the problem statement, they say r is the radius of the smallest sphere that can contain each box. So, the sphere must contain the entire box, which is equivalent to the sphere's diameter being equal to the space diagonal of the box. Therefore, the space diagonal is 2r, so r = D/2. Therefore, r² = D² /4.

So, in this case, D² is 41.0625, so r² is 41.0625 /4 = 10.265625.

But 41.0625 is 657/16. Because 41.0625 = 41 + 0.0625 = 41 + 1/16 = (41*16 +1)/16 = (656 +1)/16=657/16.

So, 657/16 divided by 4 is 657/(16*4) = 657/64. So, r² is 657/64.

Case 2: x≈3.898, z≈1.513.

Compute x² + y² + z² = 2x² + z² ≈ 2*(15.202) + (1.513)^2 ≈30.404 + 2.289≈32.693.

Then, r² ≈32.693/4≈8.173.

So, in this case, the space diagonal squared is about 32.693, which is less than 657/16≈41.0625.

Wait, so which case gives a larger space diagonal? The first case, x=2, z=5.75, gives a larger space diagonal.

Hmm, so perhaps when x=y=2, z=5.75, the space diagonal is larger, so that would require a larger sphere. Therefore, this might be our candidate for the maximum space diagonal.

But wait, I assumed x=y. Maybe the maximum occurs when x≠y≠z. So, perhaps the case I considered isn't the optimal. So, I need to check whether the symmetric case (x=y) indeed gives the maximum space diagonal or not.

Alternatively, perhaps I should proceed with the Lagrangian equations.

From the partial derivatives, equations 1,2,3.

Equation 1: 2x - 2λ(y + z) - μ yz = 0

Equation 2: 2y - 2λ(x + z) - μ xz = 0

Equation 3: 2z - 2λ(x + y) - μ xy = 0

Let me subtract equation 1 and equation 2:

[2x - 2λ(y + z) - μ yz] - [2y - 2λ(x + z) - μ xz] = 0

Expand:

2x - 2λy - 2λ z - μ yz -2y +2λx +2λ z + μ xz =0

Simplify:

(2x - 2y) + (2λx -2λy) + (- μ yz + μ xz) =0

Factor terms:

2(x - y) + 2λ(x - y) + μ z(x - y) = 0

Factor out (x - y):

(x - y)(2 + 2λ + μ z) = 0

So, either x = y, or 2 + 2λ + μ z = 0.

Similarly, subtracting equation 1 and equation 3:

Equation1 - Equation3:

[2x - 2λ(y + z) - μ yz] - [2z - 2λ(x + y) - μ xy] =0

Expand:

2x - 2λy - 2λ z - μ yz -2z +2λx +2λ y + μ xy =0

Simplify:

(2x - 2z) + (2λx - 2λ z) + (- μ yz + μ xy) =0

Factor:

2(x - z) + 2λ(x - z) + μ y(x - z)=0

Factor out (x - z):

(x - z)(2 + 2λ + μ y) =0

So, either x = z, or 2 + 2λ + μ y =0.

Similarly, subtract equation 2 - equation3:

[2y - 2λ(x + z) - μ xz] - [2z - 2λ(x + y) - μ xy] =0

Expand:

2y - 2λx -2λ z - μ xz -2z +2λx +2λ y + μ xy =0

Simplify:

(2y - 2z) + (-2λx +2λx) + (-2λ z +2λ y) + (-μ xz + μ xy)=0

Wait, simplifying step by step:

2y - 2λx -2λ z - μ xz -2z +2λx +2λ y + μ xy =0

Combine like terms:

(2y + 2λ y) + (-2λx +2λx) + (-2λ z -2z) + (-μ xz + μ xy) =0

So:

2y(1 + λ) + (-2z)(λ +1) + μ x(y - z) =0

Factor:

2(y - z)(λ +1) + μ x(y - z)=0

Factor out (y - z):

(y - z)(2(λ +1) + μ x )=0

So, either y = z, or 2(λ +1) + μ x =0.

So, from these three subtractions, either two variables are equal, or certain expressions involving λ, μ, and the variables equal zero.

Assuming that x, y, z are not all equal (since if they were, volume would be 27, which is higher than 23), but perhaps two variables are equal.

So, from equation1 - equation2: Either x=y, or 2 +2λ + μ z=0

Similarly, equation1 - equation3: Either x=z, or 2 +2λ + μ y=0

equation2 - equation3: Either y=z, or 2(λ +1) + μ x=0

So, possibilities:

Case 1: x=y=z. As we saw, this gives volume 27 which is more than 23, so not our case.

Case 2: Two variables equal, third different.

Assume x=y≠z. Then, from equation1 - equation2, we have x=y, so the first possibility holds, and the other terms are not necessarily zero.

Then, from equation1: 2x - 2λ(y + z) - μ yz =0. But since x=y, this becomes 2x - 2λ(x + z) - μ x z=0.

Similarly, equation3: 2z - 2λ(2x) - μ x²=0.

So, equation3: 2z -4λ x - μ x²=0.

We can solve for μ from equation1 and substitute into equation3.

From equation1:

2x - 2λ(x + z) - μ x z=0

Rearrange to solve for μ:

- μ x z = -2x + 2λ(x + z)

μ x z = 2x - 2λ(x + z)

μ = [2x - 2λ(x + z)] / (x z)

Similarly, equation3: 2z -4λ x - μ x²=0

Substitute μ from above:

2z -4λ x - [ (2x - 2λ(x + z)) / (x z) ] * x² =0

Simplify the third term:

[ (2x - 2λ(x + z)) / (x z) ] * x² = (2x - 2λ(x + z)) * x / z

So, equation3 becomes:

2z -4λ x - [ (2x - 2λ(x + z)) * x / z ] =0

Multiply through by z to eliminate denominator:

2z² -4λ x z - (2x - 2λ(x + z)) x =0

Expand the last term:

2z² -4λ x z - [2x² - 2λ x(x + z)] =0

Distribute the negative sign:

2z² -4λ x z -2x² + 2λ x(x + z) =0

Expand 2λ x(x + z):

2λ x² + 2λ x z

So, substitution:

2z² -4λ x z -2x² +2λ x² + 2λ x z =0

Now, let's combine like terms:

Terms with λ:

-4λ x z +2λ x² +2λ x z = 2λ x² -2λ x z

Constant terms:

2z² - 2x²

So, the equation becomes:

2λ x² -2λ x z + 2z² - 2x² =0

Factor out 2:

2[λ x² - λ x z + z² - x²] =0

Divide both sides by 2:

λ x² - λ x z + z² - x² =0

Factor:

λ(x² - x z) + (z² -x²)=0

Factor z² -x² as (z -x)(z +x)

λ x(x - z) - (x - z)(x + z) =0

Factor out (x - z):

(x - z)(λ x - (x + z))=0

So, either x = z, which would imply x=y=z, but we already considered that case, which doesn't satisfy volume 23, or:

λ x - (x + z) =0 ⇒ λ x = x + z ⇒ λ = (x + z)/x = 1 + z/x

So, now, we have λ expressed in terms of x and z.

From equation3, which we've used, and equation1, which we used to get μ.

So, now, we have λ =1 + z/x.

Now, let's try to find another equation involving λ and μ.

From equation1: we have μ = [2x - 2λ(x + z)] / (x z)

We can substitute λ =1 + z/x into this.

Compute numerator:

2x - 2λ(x + z) = 2x - 2(1 + z/x)(x + z)

Expand the term:

2(1 + z/x)(x + z) = 2[ (x + z) + (z/x)(x + z) ] = 2[ x + z + z + z²/x ] = 2[ x + 2z + z²/x ]

Wait, let me compute step by step.

Wait, (1 + z/x)(x + z) = (x + z)/x * (x + z) = (x + z)^2 /x.

Wait, no, that's not correct.

Wait, (1 + a)(b) = b + a b, where a = z/x, b =x + z.

So, (1 + z/x)(x + z) = (x + z) + (z/x)(x + z) = (x + z) + z + z²/x.

Simplify:

x + z + z + z²/x = x + 2z + z²/x.

So, 2(1 + z/x)(x + z) = 2x +4z + 2 z²/x.

Thus, numerator:

2x - [2x +4z + 2 z²/x] = 2x -2x -4z -2 z²/x = -4z -2 z²/x.

So, numerator is -4z -2 z²/x.

Denominator is x z.

Thus, μ = [ -4z -2 z²/x ] / (x z ) = [ -4z -2 z²/x ] / (x z )

Simplify numerator:

Factor out -2 z:

-2 z [ 2 + z/x ]

So, μ = [ -2 z (2 + z/x ) ] / (x z ) = [ -2 (2 + z/x ) ] /x

Simplify:

μ = -2(2 + z/x ) /x = -2(2x + z)/x².

So, μ = -2(2x + z)/x².

Now, from the Lagrangian, we have another constraint, which is the volume constraint: xyz=23.

Since x=y, in this case, so volume is x² z=23.

So, z=23/(x²).

Let's substitute z into μ.

z=23/x², so:

μ = -2(2x + 23/x² ) /x² = -2(2x^3 +23)/x^4.

Now, let's see if we can find any other expressions for λ or μ.

From equation3:

We had equation3: 2z -4λ x - μ x²=0.

We have λ =1 + z/x.

Substitute λ and μ into equation3.

Compute each term.

2z = 2*(23/x²) =46/x²

4λ x =4*(1 + z/x)*x =4*(x + z)=4x +4z=4x +4*(23/x²)=4x +92/x²

μ x² = [ -2(2x + z)/x² ] *x²= -2(2x +z) = -4x -2z= -4x -46/x².

So, equation3: 2z -4λ x - μ x²=0 becomes:

46/x² - [4x +92/x²] - [ -4x -46/x² ] =0

Simplify term by term:

46/x² -4x -92/x² +4x +46/x² =0

Combine like terms:

(46/x² -92/x² +46/x²) + (-4x +4x)=0 +0=0.

So, it holds true. Which means our substitutions are consistent.

So, now, we can find λ and μ in terms of x, and then perhaps find another equation.

Wait, but perhaps we can use the surface area equation.

Surface area is 2(xy + yz + zx)=54. Since x=y, this becomes 2(x² + 2xz)=54 ⇒ x² + 2xz=27.

We already used this equation before, and found that when x=2, z=5.75, which is 23/4.

Alternatively, when x is approximately 3.898, z≈1.513.

But perhaps both solutions are valid, but we need to check which one gives a larger space diagonal.

In the first case, x=2, z=5.75, space diagonal squared is 2² + 2² +5.75²=4+4+33.0625=41.0625.

In the other case, x≈3.898, z≈1.513, space diagonal squared is 2*(3.898)^2 + (1.513)^2≈2*(15.194)+2.289≈30.388+2.289≈32.677.

So, 41.0625 is larger, so the first case gives a larger space diagonal.

So, in the case where x=y=2, z=5.75, the space diagonal is sqrt(41.0625)=6.408, so radius is 3.204, r² is 10.265625=657/64.

Wait, 41.0625 is 657/16, so 657/16 divided by4 is 657/64.

But we need to make sure that this is indeed the maximum. Because in the Lagrangian method, we found that when x=y, the system of equations is consistent, but maybe there's another solution where all three variables are different, which could lead to a larger space diagonal.

Alternatively, perhaps the maximum space diagonal occurs when two variables are equal, as in the x=y case, because when you have more variables, the space diagonal can be larger or smaller depending on the configuration.

Wait, let me think about the space diagonal squared, which is x² + y² + z².

Given the constraints on surface area and volume, perhaps the maximum occurs when two variables are as small as possible, making the third variable as large as possible, thus maximizing x² + y² + z².

So, in the case where x=y=2, z=5.75, we have a larger z, which would contribute more to the space diagonal.

Alternatively, perhaps when variables are more spread out, the sum of squares is larger.

Wait, if we have a box that's very long in one dimension and small in others, the space diagonal would be larger.

But in our case, given the constraints of surface area and volume, how much can we stretch one dimension?

Wait, let's see.

Suppose we fix x and y to be very small, then z would have to be large to keep the volume constant. But the surface area would be dominated by the xz and yz terms.

Wait, for example, if x and y approach zero, the volume xyz approaches zero, which is not our case since volume is fixed at 23. So, we can't make x and y too small.

Alternatively, perhaps the maximum occurs when two variables are equal, as in the case we considered, but I need to confirm.

Alternatively, perhaps we can consider the case where all variables are different and set up equations to find the maximum.

But that might get complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps using AM-QM inequality or other inequalities to find bounds on x² + y² + z².

Wait, but I'm not sure about that.

Alternatively, perhaps I can think of x² + y² + z² in terms of the surface area and volume.

We have surface area S=54=2(xy + yz + zx).

We also have volume V=23=xyz.

We need to maximize x² + y² + z².

Hmm, perhaps I can use the identity:

(x + y + z)^2 = x² + y² + z² + 2(xy + yz + zx)

So, from this, x² + y² + z² = (x + y + z)^2 - 2S

We need to maximize x² + y² + z², which is equivalent to maximizing (x + y + z)^2.

So, to maximize x² + y² + z², we need to maximize x + y + z.

So, the problem reduces to maximizing x + y + z given that S=54 and V=23.

Hmm, that's an interesting approach.

So, perhaps I can use the method of Lagrange multipliers again, but now to maximize x + y + z with the same constraints.

Wait, but I already did that earlier, and it's leading to the same system of equations.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use the AM ≥ GM inequality.

But I'm not sure if that's directly applicable here.

Alternatively, maybe I can use substitution.

Let me denote s = x + y + z, p = xy + yz + zx =27, and q=xyz=23.

We can think of x, y, z as the roots of the cubic equation:

t³ - s t² + p t - q =0 ⇒ t³ - s t² +27 t -23=0

But without knowing s, it's difficult to proceed.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use the inequality between quadratic mean and geometric mean.

Wait, (x² + y² + z²)/3 ≥ ((xyz)^(2/3)).

But that would be QM ≥ GM.

But (x² + y² + z²)/3 ≥ (23)^(2/3).

But 23^(2/3) is approximately 5.848, so x² + y² + z² ≥ 3 *5.848≈17.545.

But we need the maximum, not the minimum.

Alternatively, perhaps the maximum is unbounded, but given the constraints on surface area and volume, it's not.

Wait, but if we fix the surface area and volume, can the space diagonal be made arbitrarily large? I don't think so, because increasing one dimension would require decreasing others to maintain the volume, but the surface area would also change.

Wait, for example, if I make z very large, then x and y must be small to keep xyz=23. But then, the surface area would be dominated by 2(xz + yz), which would be large if z is large, but our surface area is fixed at 54. So, if z increases, x and y must decrease to keep surface area at 54, but then xyz would decrease, which is fixed at 23. So, that limits how large z can be.

Therefore, there is a maximum possible value for z, which would correspond to the case when x=y, since that's the case when the product is maximized for given surface area and volume.

Wait, I'm not sure about that. But perhaps the maximum occurs when two variables are equal.

So, in that case, the x=y=2, z=5.75 case gives the maximum space diagonal.

Therefore, the radius squared is (x² + y² + z²)/4= (4 +4 +33.0625)/4=41.0625/4=10.265625=657/64.

Therefore, p=657, q=64. They are coprime because 657 ÷ 64 is 10.265625, and 657 and 64 share no common factors besides 1.

Wait, let me check. 64 is 2^6. 657 is odd, so not divisible by 2. 657 ÷3=219, so 657=3*219=3*3*73. 73 is a prime. 64 is 2^6, so no common factors. So yes, 657 and 64 are coprime.

Therefore, p + q=657 +64=721.

So, the answer is 721.

To find the radius \( r \) of the smallest sphere that can contain any rectangular box from the set \( \mathcal{B} \), we need to maximize the space diagonal of the boxes given the constraints of surface area \( 54 \) and volume \( 23 \). The radius \( r \) is half the space diagonal, so \( r^2 = \frac{x^2 + y^2 + z^2}{4} \).

We start by denoting the dimensions of the box as \( x, y, z \). The surface area constraint is:
\[
2(xy + yz + zx) = 54
\]
and the volume constraint is:
\[
xyz = 23
\]
We aim to maximize \( x^2 + y^2 + z^2 \).

Assuming symmetry, we consider the case where \( x = y \neq z \). This simplifies the surface area equation to:
\[
2x^2 + 4xz = 54 \implies x^2 + 2xz = 27
\]
From the volume constraint:
\[
x^2 z = 23 \implies z = \frac{23}{x^2}
\]
Substituting \( z \) into the surface area equation:
\[
x^2 + 2x \left( \frac{23}{x^2} \right) = 27 \implies x^2 + \frac{46}{x} = 27
\]
Multiplying through by \( x \):
\[
x^3 - 27x + 46 = 0
\]
Using the Rational Root Theorem, we find \( x = 2 \) is a root. Factoring:
\[
(x - 2)(x^2 + 2x - 23) = 0
\]
Solving \( x^2 + 2x - 23 = 0 \) gives non-integer roots, so we take \( x = 2 \). Then:
\[
z = \frac{23}{2^2} = \frac{23}{4} = 5.75
\]
The space diagonal squared is:
\[
x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = 2^2 + 2^2 + 5.75^2 = 4 + 4 + 33.0625 = 41.0625
\]
Thus, \( r^2 = \frac{41.0625}{4} = \frac{657}{64} \). Since 657 and 64 are coprime, \( p = 657 \) and \( q = 64 \), giving \( p + q = 721 \).

\[
\boxed{721}
\]
