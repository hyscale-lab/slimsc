Okay, so I have this geometry problem here, and I need to find the product AB·AC in triangle ABC. The problem states that the circumcenter is O, the incenter is I, IA is perpendicular to OI, the circumradius is 13, and the inradius is 6. Hmm, let's try to unpack this step by step.

First, let me recall some properties. The circumradius R is given as 13, and the inradius r is 6. I know that the inradius is related to the area and the semiperimeter, right? The formula for the inradius is r = A/s, where A is the area of the triangle and s is the semiperimeter. So maybe that will come in handy later.

The circumradius formula for a triangle is R = (a b c)/(4 A), where a, b, c are the side lengths. But I don't know the side lengths yet. However, I need to find AB·AC, which is c·b in standard notation where AB = c, BC = a, and AC = b.

Wait, actually, let me confirm the notation. Usually, in triangle ABC, side a is opposite vertex A, side b is opposite vertex B, and side c is opposite vertex C. So, AB would be side c, BC is side a, and AC is side b. So AB·AC would be c·b.

But perhaps it's easier to think in terms of variables. Let me assign variables: let the sides opposite A, B, C be a, b, c respectively. Then, AB is opposite to C, so AB = c; AC is opposite to B, so AC = b. So, AB·AC = b·c.

So, the target is to find b·c. Hmm. Let's think about properties involving the inradius, circumradius, and other centers.

Given that IA is perpendicular to OI. IA is the line from incenter I to vertex A, and OI is the line connecting the incenter I to the circumcenter O. So, IA ⊥ OI. That seems like an important geometric condition. Maybe I can use coordinate geometry or vector methods, but perhaps there's a more straightforward approach using triangle properties.

I remember that in any triangle, the distance between the incenter and circumcenter is given by the formula:

OI² = R(R - 2r)

Wait, is that correct? Let me recall the formula. Yes, I think that's correct. OI² = R² - 2 R r. So, with R =13 and r =6, OI² = 13² - 2*13*6.

Calculating that: 13² is 169, 2*13*6 is 156. So OI² = 169 - 156 = 13. Therefore, OI = sqrt(13). Hmm, that's a useful piece of information.

Now, IA is perpendicular to OI. So, in triangle IOI, wait no, perhaps in triangle IOA or something else. Wait, let's consider the vectors or coordinates.

Alternatively, maybe we can set up a coordinate system. Let me try coordinate geometry. Let me place the circumcenter O at the origin (0,0). Since O is the circumcenter, all the vertices A, B, C lie on the circumference of the circle with radius 13.

The incenter I is somewhere inside the triangle. The condition IA is perpendicular to OI. So, vector IA is perpendicular to vector OI.

Wait, if I is at (x, y), then vector OI is (x, y), and vector IA is (A - I), where A is (a, b) on the circumcircle, so ||A|| = 13.

But this might get complicated. Maybe there's a better way.

Alternatively, maybe I can use trigonometric identities or relations in triangle ABC. Let me recall that in a triangle, the distance from the incenter to a vertex can be expressed in terms of the triangle's parameters.

The formula for the length of IA is given by IA = (r)/(sin(A/2)). Wait, is that correct? Let me think. Yes, I believe the distance from the inradius to vertex A is IA = r / sin(A/2). Similarly, IB = r / sin(B/2), IC = r / sin(C/2). So, IA = 6 / sin(A/2).

Since IA is perpendicular to OI, the vectors IA and OI are perpendicular, so their dot product is zero. Alternatively, the triangle formed by points I, A, O is right-angled at I.

So, in triangle IOA, we have a right angle at I. So, by the Pythagorean theorem:

IA² + OI² = OA².

But OA is the circumradius, which is 13. So:

IA² + OI² = OA² => IA² + (sqrt(13))² = 13² => IA² + 13 = 169 => IA² = 156 => IA = sqrt(156) = 2*sqrt(39). Hmm, interesting.

But we also have another expression for IA, which is IA = r / sin(A/2) = 6 / sin(A/2). So, from this, IA = 6 / sin(A/2) = 2*sqrt(39). Therefore, 6 / sin(A/2) = 2*sqrt(39) => sin(A/2) = 6 / (2*sqrt(39)) = 3 / sqrt(39) = sqrt(39)/13.

Wait, let's compute that. 3 / sqrt(39) can be rationalized as (3*sqrt(39))/39 = sqrt(39)/13. So, sin(A/2) = sqrt(39)/13.

That's a useful value. Now, from this, we can find cos(A/2) using the identity sin²θ + cos²θ = 1.

So, cos²(A/2) = 1 - (sqrt(39)/13)² = 1 - 39/169 = (169 - 39)/169 = 130/169. Therefore, cos(A/2) = sqrt(130)/13.

Since A is an angle in a triangle, A/2 is less than 90 degrees, so cos(A/2) is positive.

Now, using the formula for cos A in terms of cos(A/2):

cos A = 2 cos²(A/2) - 1 = 2*(130/169) - 1 = 260/169 - 1 = (260 - 169)/169 = 91/169.

So, cos A = 91/169. That simplifies to 91/169, which can be reduced? Let's see, 91 is 13*7, 169 is 13². So, 91/169 = 7/13. So, cos A = 7/13.

Therefore, angle A has cosine 7/13, so sin A can be found using sin²A + cos²A =1.

sin A = sqrt(1 - (7/13)^2) = sqrt(1 - 49/169) = sqrt(120/169) = (2*sqrt(30))/13.

So, sin A = 2*sqrt(30)/13.

Now, using the formula for the area of the triangle, A = (1/2)*b*c*sin A.

We know the area A can also be expressed using the inradius: A = r*s, where s is the semiperimeter.

So, A = r*s = 6*s.

Also, we have A = (1/2)*b*c*sin A.

So, let's write that:

6*s = (1/2)*b*c*(2*sqrt(30)/13) => 6*s = (b*c*sqrt(30))/13.

So, 6*s = (b c sqrt(30))/13.

Hmm, so we have 6s = (b c sqrt(30))/13.

But we need to find b*c. So, if we can express s in terms of b and c, perhaps we can find an equation.

Also, we have the circumradius formula: R = (a b c)/(4 A).

We know R =13, and A =6*s.

So, 13 = (a b c)/(4*6*s) => 13 = (a b c)/(24 s) => a b c = 13*24 s = 312 s.

Hmm, so a b c = 312 s.

Another formula I can use is the Law of Cosines. From earlier, we found cos A =7/13, and A is the angle opposite side a.

Law of Cosines: a² = b² + c² - 2 b c cos A.

So, a² = b² + c² - 2 b c*(7/13).

But I don't know a, b, c, so maybe that's too many variables. But maybe we can relate s with the sides.

The semiperimeter s = (a + b + c)/2.

We have a b c = 312 s. Hmm, perhaps if we can find expressions for a, b, c in terms of s.

Alternatively, maybe I can relate the inradius and the semiperimeter. Also, the area is A = r s =6 s.

We also have the formula for area in terms of circumradius: A = (a b c)/(4 R) = (a b c)/52.

But since A =6 s, so 6 s = (a b c)/52 => a b c = 312 s, which is the same as before. So nothing new there.

Wait, but I have another relationship: from earlier, 6 s = (b c sqrt(30))/13. So, 6 s = (b c sqrt(30))/13.

So, rearranged, s = (b c sqrt(30))/(6*13) = (b c sqrt(30))/78.

So, s = (b c sqrt(30))/78.

But s is also (a + b + c)/2.

So, (a + b + c)/2 = (b c sqrt(30))/78 => a + b + c = (b c sqrt(30))/39.

Hmm, so a = (b c sqrt(30))/39 - b - c.

But I don't know if that's helpful yet.

Alternatively, let's think about the formula involving the inradius and the exradius. Wait, maybe not.

Wait, perhaps using the formula for the length of the median? Hmm, not sure.

Wait, another thought: we can use the formula that relates the product of the sides with the inradius and semiperimeter.

Wait, the formula for the area in terms of inradius is A = r s, which we have as 6 s.

Also, the area can be written as A = (1/2)ab sin C, but perhaps that's not helpful here.

Wait, maybe I can use the formula involving the cosine of angle A and the sides.

Wait, from earlier, a² = b² + c² - 2 b c*(7/13).

Also, from the Law of Sines, a / sin A = 2 R. So, a = 2 R sin A = 2*13*(2 sqrt(30)/13) = 2*13*(2 sqrt(30)/13) = 4 sqrt(30).

Wait, that's interesting. So, a = 4 sqrt(30).

Wait, let me check that again. Law of Sines says that a/sin A = 2 R.

So, sin A is 2 sqrt(30)/13, R is 13, so 2 R = 26.

So, a = 26 * sin A = 26 * (2 sqrt(30)/13) = (26/13)*2 sqrt(30) = 2*2 sqrt(30) =4 sqrt(30). Yes, that's correct. So, a =4 sqrt(30).

Hmm, so side a is known now. So, a =4 sqrt(30). So, that's helpful.

Now, go back to the Law of Cosines expression: a² = b² + c² - 2 b c cos A.

We have a² = (4 sqrt(30))² = 16*30 =480.

So, 480 = b² + c² - 2 b c*(7/13).

So, 480 = b² + c² - (14/13) b c.

Let me rearrange this: b² + c² = 480 + (14/13) b c.

Hmm, but I don't know b and c. But I need to find b c.

Wait, maybe I can get another equation involving b and c.

From the earlier expression, a + b + c = (b c sqrt(30))/39, and a is known as 4 sqrt(30). So, plug that in:

4 sqrt(30) + b + c = (b c sqrt(30))/39.

So, let me write this as:

b + c = (b c sqrt(30))/39 -4 sqrt(30).

Hmm, maybe I can factor out sqrt(30):

b + c = sqrt(30)*(b c / 39 -4).

Hmm, but I don't know b and c, so this is still tricky.

Wait, perhaps I can let x = b + c and y = b c. Then, from the expressions above, maybe I can set up equations in x and y.

So, let me define:

x = b + c

y = b c

Then, from the Law of Cosines expression:

480 = b² + c² - (14/13) y.

But b² + c² = (b + c)^2 - 2 b c = x² - 2 y.

So, substituting into the equation:

480 = x² - 2 y - (14/13) y.

Simplify:

480 = x² - [2 + 14/13] y = x² - (26/13 +14/13) y = x² - (40/13) y.

So, 480 = x² - (40/13) y. Let's write this as equation (1):

x² - (40/13) y =480.

Now, from the semiperimeter equation earlier:

x + a = 2 s.

Wait, no, s = (a + b + c)/2 = (4 sqrt(30) +x)/2.

So, s = (4 sqrt(30) + x)/2.

From earlier, another equation was 6 s = (y sqrt(30))/13.

So, 6 * [ (4 sqrt(30) + x)/2 ] = (y sqrt(30))/13.

Simplify:

6*(4 sqrt(30) +x)/2 = (y sqrt(30))/13 => 3*(4 sqrt(30) +x) = (y sqrt(30))/13.

Multiply both sides by 13:

39*(4 sqrt(30) +x) = y sqrt(30).

So, y sqrt(30) = 39*(4 sqrt(30) +x).

Divide both sides by sqrt(30):

y = 39*(4 + (x)/sqrt(30)).

Hmm, that seems a bit messy, but let's proceed.

So, y = 39*4 + (39 x)/sqrt(30) = 156 + (39 x)/sqrt(30).

Hmm, perhaps it's better to write this as:

y = 156 + (39 x)/sqrt(30)

But I can write sqrt(30) as sqrt(30) = sqrt(30). Maybe rationalize the denominator:

(39 x)/sqrt(30) = (39 x sqrt(30))/(30) = (13 x sqrt(30))/10.

So, y =156 + (13 x sqrt(30))/10.

So, equation (2): y = 156 + (13 x sqrt(30))/10.

Now, go back to equation (1):

x² - (40/13) y =480.

Substitute y from equation (2):

x² - (40/13)*(156 + (13 x sqrt(30))/10 ) =480.

Let me compute this step by step.

First, compute (40/13)*156:

40/13 *156 =40*(156/13)=40*12=480.

Then, compute (40/13)*(13 x sqrt(30)/10):

40/13 *13 x sqrt(30)/10 = (40 *13 x sqrt(30))/(13*10) )= (40 x sqrt(30))/10 =4 x sqrt(30).

So, putting it all together:

x² - [480 +4 x sqrt(30)] =480.

So, x² -480 -4 x sqrt(30) =480.

Bring 480 to the other side:

x² -4 x sqrt(30) = 960.

So, equation: x² -4 sqrt(30) x -960=0.

This is a quadratic equation in x. Let's solve for x.

The quadratic equation is x² -4 sqrt(30) x -960=0.

Using the quadratic formula:

x = [4 sqrt(30) ± sqrt( (4 sqrt(30))² +4*960 ) ] /2.

Compute discriminant D:

D= (4 sqrt(30))² +4*960=16*30 +3840=480 +3840=4320.

So, sqrt(D)=sqrt(4320).

Simplify sqrt(4320):

4320= 16*270=16*9*30=16*9*30= (4²)(3²)(30). So sqrt(4320)=4*3*sqrt(30)=12 sqrt(30).

So, x= [4 sqrt(30) ±12 sqrt(30)] /2.

Compute both possibilities:

1. [4 sqrt(30)+12 sqrt(30)] /2=16 sqrt(30)/2=8 sqrt(30).

2. [4 sqrt(30)-12 sqrt(30)] /2= (-8 sqrt(30))/2= -4 sqrt(30).

But x is b + c, which is positive, so we discard the negative solution.

Thus, x=8 sqrt(30).

So, x=8 sqrt(30), which is b + c=8 sqrt(30).

Now, from equation (2), y=156 + (13 x sqrt(30))/10.

Plugging x=8 sqrt(30):

y=156 + (13 *8 sqrt(30)*sqrt(30))/10.

Simplify sqrt(30)*sqrt(30)=30.

So, y=156 + (13*8*30)/10.

Compute 13*8=104, 104*30=3120.

3120/10=312.

So, y=156 +312=468.

Thus, y=468, which is b c=468.

So, AB·AC= b c=468.

Let me just check my steps to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.

- Found OI²=13, so OI=sqrt(13).

- IA is perpendicular to OI, so in triangle IOA, which is right-angled at I, IA² + OI² = OA². So IA²=169-13=156, IA=sqrt(156)=2 sqrt(39).

- IA is also r / sin(A/2)=6 / sin(A/2)=2 sqrt(39). So sin(A/2)=3/sqrt(39)=sqrt(39)/13.

- Then cos(A/2)=sqrt(130)/13, and cos A=2 cos²(A/2)-1=7/13.

- From Law of Sines, a=2 R sin A=4 sqrt(30).

- Law of Cosines: a²=480= b² + c² - (14/13) bc.

- Let x=b +c, y=bc. Then, from equation 480= x² - (40/13) y.

- From semiperimeter and area, found y=156 + (13 x sqrt(30))/10.

- Substituted y into equation, solved quadratic, got x=8 sqrt(30).

- Then found y=468, so bc=468.

All the steps seem consistent. So, I think the answer is 468.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To solve the problem, we start by noting that the circumradius \( R = 13 \) and the inradius \( r = 6 \). The distance between the circumcenter \( O \) and the incenter \( I \) is given by \( OI = \sqrt{R(R - 2r)} = \sqrt{13} \). Since \( IA \perp OI \), triangle \( IOA \) is right-angled at \( I \). Using the Pythagorean theorem:

\[
IA^2 + OI^2 = OA^2 \implies IA^2 + 13 = 169 \implies IA^2 = 156 \implies IA = 2\sqrt{39}.
\]

Using the formula \( IA = \frac{r}{\sin(A/2)} \), we find:

\[
2\sqrt{39} = \frac{6}{\sin(A/2)} \implies \sin(A/2) = \frac{\sqrt{39}}{13}.
\]

Next, we calculate \( \cos(A/2) \) using the identity \( \sin^2(A/2) + \cos^2(A/2) = 1 \):

\[
\cos^2(A/2) = 1 - \left(\frac{\sqrt{39}}{13}\right)^2 = \frac{130}{169} \implies \cos(A/2) = \frac{\sqrt{130}}{13}.
\]

Using the double-angle formula for cosine:

\[
\cos A = 2\cos^2(A/2) - 1 = 2 \cdot \frac{130}{169} - 1 = \frac{91}{169} = \frac{7}{13}.
\]

The sine of angle \( A \) is:

\[
\sin A = \sqrt{1 - \cos^2 A} = \sqrt{1 - \left(\frac{7}{13}\right)^2} = \frac{2\sqrt{30}}{13}.
\]

Using the Law of Sines, the side \( a \) opposite angle \( A \) is:

\[
a = 2R \sin A = 2 \cdot 13 \cdot \frac{2\sqrt{30}}{13} = 4\sqrt{30}.
\]

Next, we use the Law of Cosines:

\[
a^2 = b^2 + c^2 - 2bc \cos A \implies 480 = b^2 + c^2 - \frac{14}{13}bc.
\]

Let \( x = b + c \) and \( y = bc \). Then, \( b^2 + c^2 = x^2 - 2y \), so:

\[
480 = x^2 - 2y - \frac{14}{13}y \implies 480 = x^2 - \frac{40}{13}y.
\]

From the area formula \( A = 6s \) and \( A = \frac{1}{2}bc \sin A \), we find:

\[
6s = \frac{bc \cdot 2\sqrt{30}}{13} \implies 6s = \frac{y\sqrt{30}}{13}.
\]

The semiperimeter \( s = \frac{a + b + c}{2} = \frac{4\sqrt{30} + x}{2} \). Substituting into the area equation:

\[
6 \cdot \frac{4\sqrt{30} + x}{2} = \frac{y\sqrt{30}}{13} \implies 3(4\sqrt{30} + x) = \frac{y\sqrt{30}}{13}.
\]

Solving for \( y \):

\[
y = 156 + \frac{13x\sqrt{30}}{10}.
\]

Substituting \( y \) into the earlier equation:

\[
x^2 - \frac{40}{13}\left(156 + \frac{13x\sqrt{30}}{10}\right) = 480 \implies x^2 - 4x\sqrt{30} - 960 = 0.
\]

Solving this quadratic equation for \( x \):

\[
x = \frac{4\sqrt{30} \pm 12\sqrt{30}}{2} \implies x = 8\sqrt{30}.
\]

Substituting \( x = 8\sqrt{30} \) back to find \( y \):

\[
y = 156 + \frac{13 \cdot 8\sqrt{30} \cdot \sqrt{30}}{10} = 156 + 312 = 468.
\]

Thus, the product \( AB \cdot AC = bc = \boxed{468} \).
