Okay, so I've got this math problem here about residents in Aimeville and what they own. Let me read it again and try to break it down step by step.

The problem says there are 900 residents total. Among these, 195 own a diamond ring, 367 own a set of golf clubs, 562 own a garden spade, and everyone owns a bag of candy hearts. So, candy hearts are universal—they’re owned by all 900 residents. Interesting.

Then, it mentions that 437 residents own exactly two of these things, and 234 own exactly three of them. The question is asking how many residents own all four items—diamond ring, golf clubs, garden spade, and candy hearts.

Hmm, okay, so this seems like a problem involving sets and maybe using the principle of inclusion-exclusion. I remember that inclusion-exclusion helps calculate the union of multiple sets by considering their intersections. Since there are four items, we might need to use the formula for four sets.

Wait, but in this case, it's a bit different because we have information about people owning exactly two or exactly three things. So, perhaps we can model this using the inclusion-exclusion principle by considering each possible combination.

Let me recall the inclusion-exclusion formula for four sets. The formula for the total number of elements in the union of four sets A, B, C, D is:

|A ∪ B ∪ C ∪ D| = |A| + |B| + |C| + |D| - |A∩B| - |A∩C| - |A∩D| - |B∩C| - |B∩D| - |C∩D| + |A∩B∩C| + |A∩B∩D| + |A∩C∩D| + |B∩C∩D| - |A∩B∩C∩D|

But wait, in our case, every resident owns at least the candy hearts. So, the total union of A, B, C, D is 900. Because everyone owns candy hearts, so no one is outside of A ∪ B ∪ C ∪ D. So, |A ∪ B ∪ C ∪ D| = 900.

Let me denote:

- D as the set of people who own a diamond ring.
- G as golf clubs.
- S as garden spade.
- H as candy hearts. But since everyone owns H, H is the universal set.

Wait, but if H is universal, then any intersection involving H is just the other set. For example, D ∩ H is just D. Similarly, G ∩ H is G, and so on.

Hmm, that might complicate things a bit, but perhaps we can proceed.

Let me denote the four sets as D, G, S, H, but since H is universal, maybe I can consider the problem in terms of the other three: D, G, S. But H is always included, so everyone owns H, so owning all four is the same as owning D, G, S, and H. Since everyone already has H, owning all four is just owning D, G, and S.

But wait, the problem is about those who own all four, which includes H, but since all own H anyway, it's just the number of people who own D, G, and S.

Wait, no. Wait, the problem says 437 own exactly two of these things, and 234 own exactly three. So, these numbers are in addition to the ownership of H.

Wait, no, because the residents own H regardless. So, the counts for exactly two and exactly three would include H as one of the items. Hmm, that might not be correct.

Let me think again. The problem states that each resident owns a bag of candy hearts. So, when it says "exactly two of these things," it includes the candy hearts. So, someone who owns a diamond ring and a garden spade also owns the candy hearts. So, when it's said that 437 own exactly two, those two could include H or not.

Wait, but actually, since H is universal, any ownership counts must include H. So, if someone owns exactly two things, those two must include H and one other. Because they can't own two things without H, since they all have H.

Similarly, someone owning exactly three things must have H plus two others. And those owning all four would have H plus the other three.

So, let's model this.

Let me define:

- Let a be the number of people who own exactly H only. But since every resident owns H, a is the number who own only H and nothing else. But wait, no—because 437 own exactly two, which includes H, and 234 own exactly three, which includes H, and some own all four.

Wait, but if all 900 own H, then the only way someone could own exactly one thing is owning only H. But the problem doesn't mention anyone owning exactly one thing. It only mentions exactly two, exactly three, and presumably, all four. Because the 437 is exactly two, 234 exactly three, and we're to find exactly four. So, perhaps some own exactly four (all four), others own exactly three (H plus two others), exactly two (H plus one other), and exactly one (H only). But the problem doesn't give info about exactly one.

Wait, but the problem says 437 own exactly two, 234 own exactly three, and we're to find exactly four. So, the remaining are those who own exactly one, which is only H.

So, let's structure the problem this way.

Total residents: 900.

They can be partitioned into four groups:

1. Exactly H only: let's call this x.

2. Exactly H and one other: 437.

3. Exactly H and two others: 234.

4. Exactly H, D, G, S: this is what we're trying to find, let's call it y.

So, x + 437 + 234 + y = 900.

So, x + y = 900 - 437 - 234.

Calculating that: 437 + 234 = 671. 900 - 671 = 229. So, x + y = 229.

But we don't know x or y yet. So, we need another equation.

We know the counts for D, G, S. Let's think about the total number of people owning D, G, S, and H.

But since H is included in all, the counts for D, G, S include people who may own other things as well.

Wait, let me think in terms of the individual counts.

The number of people owning D is 195, which includes those who own D and only D (but that's not possible because everyone owns H, so they must own D and H at least). So, the 195 are people who own D and some combination of the others, including H.

Similarly for G: 367. And S: 562.

So, the total number of D owners is 195, which includes:

- Those who own exactly D and H (i.e., only D and H).

- Those who own D, H, and one other (G or S).

- Those who own D, H, G, and S (all four).

Similarly for G and S.

So, the 195 D owners can be broken down as:

- (H and D only): let's call this d1.

- (H, D, G only): d2.

- (H, D, S only): d3.

- (H, D, G, S): y.

Similarly, for G: 367.

- (H and G only): g1.

- (H, G, D only): g2 (same as d2).

- (H, G, S only): g3.

- (H, G, D, S): y.

For S: 562.

- (H and S only): s1.

- (H, S, D only): s2 (same as d3).

- (H, S, G only): s3 (same as g3).

- (H, S, D, G): y.

So, the total for D is d1 + d2 + d3 + y = 195.

Similarly, for G: g1 + g2 + g3 + y = 367.

For S: s1 + s2 + s3 + y = 562.

Now, the number of people owning exactly two things is 437. Those are the people who own H and exactly one other.

So, exactly two things: H + D, H + G, H + S.

The counts for exactly two are:

- H and D only: d1.

- H and G only: g1.

- H and S only: s1.

So, d1 + g1 + s1 = 437.

Similarly, the number of people owning exactly three things is 234. These are the people who own H and two others. So, exactly three are:

- H, D, G only: d2.

- H, D, S only: d3.

- H, G, S only: g3.

So, d2 + d3 + g3 = 234.

And we have y as the number who own all four.

Now, let's also note that the people who own exactly four are y.

Additionally, we've got x, the number of people who own only H.

So, putting it all together, the total number of people is:

x + (d1 + g1 + s1) + (d2 + d3 + g3) + y = x + 437 + 234 + y = 900.

As I had earlier, x + y = 229.

Now, let's think about the counts for D, G, S.

From D: d1 + d2 + d3 + y = 195.

From G: g1 + g2 + g3 + y = 367.

From S: s1 + s2 + s3 + y = 562.

But wait, d2 is the same as g2, which is H, D, G only. Similarly, d3 is H, D, S, same as s2. g3 is H, G, S, same as s3.

Wait, but in the counts for exactly three, d2, d3, g3 are the same as g2, s2, s3.

So, let's see:

We have:

d1 + g1 + s1 = 437.

d2 + d3 + g3 = 234.

And y is the all-four.

Also, the counts for D, G, S are as above.

So, let me think about the total number of people owning D, which is 195.

That includes d1 (H and D), d2 (H, D, G), d3 (H, D, S), and y (all four).

Similarly for G and S.

So, for D: d1 + d2 + d3 + y = 195.

Similarly, for G: g1 + d2 + g3 + y = 367.

For S: s1 + d3 + g3 + y = 562.

Wait, that's because:

For G, the people owning G are:

- H and G only: g1.

- H, D, G: d2.

- H, G, S: g3.

- All four: y.

Similarly for S.

So, now we have three equations:

1. For D: d1 + d2 + d3 + y = 195.

2. For G: g1 + d2 + g3 + y = 367.

3. For S: s1 + d3 + g3 + y = 562.

We also have:

4. d1 + g1 + s1 = 437. (Exactly two, which are H and one other.)

5. d2 + d3 + g3 = 234. (Exactly three, which are H and two others.)

6. x + y = 229. (From the total.)

We have six equations and six variables: d1, d2, d3, g1, g3, s1, s3, but wait, no. Let me list all variables.

Wait, x is separate. So, variables are:

d1, d2, d3, g1, g3, s1, s3, y, x.

Wait, but in the equations, I think we might have more variables than equations. Hmm.

Wait, let me recount the equations.

Equation 1: d1 + d2 + d3 + y = 195.

Equation 2: g1 + d2 + g3 + y = 367.

Equation 3: s1 + d3 + g3 + y = 562.

Equation 4: d1 + g1 + s1 = 437.

Equation 5: d2 + d3 + g3 = 234.

Equation 6: x + y = 229.

So, variables are d1, d2, d3, g1, g3, s1, y, x.

That's eight variables, but we have six equations. Hmm, I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps s3 is not a variable here because s3 is the same as g3, which is H, G, S. So, in equation 3, s3 is same as g3? Or maybe I made a mistake in the variables.

Wait, in equation 3, I wrote s1 + d3 + g3 + y = 562.

But s3 is H, S, G, which is same as g3. So, in equation 3, s3 is g3.

Wait no, equation 3 is about S owners: H and S only (s1), H, D, S (d3), H, G, S (g3), and all four (y). So, equation 3 is correctly written as s1 + d3 + g3 + y = 562.

So, variables are d1, d2, d3, g1, g3, s1, y, x.

Wait, eight variables. So, equations 1-6 (6 equations) plus equation 6.

Wait, but equation 6 is x + y = 229.

Hmm, perhaps we can find expressions that relate these variables.

Let me see. Maybe if I add equations 1, 2, 3.

Adding equation 1: d1 + d2 + d3 + y = 195.

Equation 2: g1 + d2 + g3 + y = 367.

Equation 3: s1 + d3 + g3 + y = 562.

Adding these three:

(d1 + g1 + s1) + (d2 + d3 + g3) + 3y = 195 + 367 + 562.

But from equation 4, d1 + g1 + s1 = 437.

From equation 5, d2 + d3 + g3 = 234.

So substituting these into the sum:

437 + 234 + 3y = 195 + 367 + 562.

Compute the right side: 195 + 367 = 562; 562 + 562 = 1124.

Left side: 437 + 234 = 671; 671 + 3y = 1124.

So, 3y = 1124 - 671 = 453.

Therefore, y = 453 / 3 = 151.

Wait, so y is 151. That's the number of people who own all four items, which is the answer we're looking for.

Let me double-check that.

So, adding the three equations:

(d1 + d2 + d3 + y) + (g1 + d2 + g3 + y) + (s1 + d3 + g3 + y) = 195 + 367 + 562.

Which is (d1 + g1 + s1) + 2(d2 + d3 + g3) + 3y = 1124.

But from equation 4, d1 + g1 + s1 = 437.

From equation 5, d2 + d3 + g3 = 234.

So, substituting:

437 + 2*(234) + 3y = 1124.

Calculating 2*234 = 468.

So, 437 + 468 = 905.

905 + 3y = 1124.

3y = 1124 - 905 = 219.

Wait, that's conflicting with my earlier calculation. Wait, no, wait. Wait, I think I made a mistake in the addition.

Wait, no, in the initial addition, I thought that adding the three equations would give:

d1 + g1 + s1 (which is 437) + 2*(d2 + d3 + g3) (which is 2*234) + 3y = 195 + 367 + 562.

But wait, the right side is 195 + 367 + 562 = 1124.

So, 437 + 468 + 3y = 1124.

437 + 468 = 905.

So, 905 + 3y = 1124.

Thus, 3y = 1124 - 905 = 219.

Then, y = 219 / 3 = 73.

Wait, so that contradicts my earlier calculation. Now I'm confused.

Wait, wait, wait. Let me recalculate the sum.

Equation 1: d1 + d2 + d3 + y = 195.

Equation 2: g1 + d2 + g3 + y = 367.

Equation 3: s1 + d3 + g3 + y = 562.

Adding all three equations:

d1 + g1 + s1 + d2 + d3 + d2 + g3 + d3 + g3 + y + y + y = 195 + 367 + 562.

Wait, no, that's not correct. Let me do it step by step.

Equation 1: d1 + d2 + d3 + y.

Equation 2: g1 + d2 + g3 + y.

Equation3: s1 + d3 + g3 + y.

Add them:

d1 + g1 + s1 +

d2 + d2 (from equations 1 and 2) +

d3 + d3 (from equations 1 and 3) +

g3 + g3 (from equations 2 and 3) +

y + y + y.

So total sum:

(d1 + g1 + s1) + 2*d2 + 2*d3 + 2*g3 + 3y.

Which equals 195 + 367 + 562 = 1124.

From equation 4: d1 + g1 + s1 = 437.

From equation5: d2 + d3 + g3 = 234.

So, 437 + 2*(234) + 3y = 1124.

Wait, 2*(234) is 468.

So, 437 + 468 = 905.

Then, 905 + 3y = 1124.

3y = 1124 -905 = 219.

y = 219 /3 = 73.

Hmm, so that's different from my initial calculation. I must have made a mistake earlier.

So, the correct value of y is 73.

But wait, I thought earlier that adding equations 1-3 would be d1 + d2 + d3 + y + g1 + d2 + g3 + y + s1 + d3 + g3 + y, but that's incorrect because each equation is a sum, not a product. So, when adding, each variable is counted as many times as it appears in the sum.

So, in equation 1: d1, d2, d3, y.

Equation2: g1, d2, g3, y.

Equation3: s1, d3, g3, y.

So, adding them:

d1 + g1 + s1 + (d2 + d2) + (d3 + d3) + (g3 + g3) + (y + y + y).

Which is (d1 + g1 + s1) + 2d2 + 2d3 + 2g3 + 3y.

Which becomes 437 + 2*(d2 + d3 + g3) +3y.

But since d2 + d3 + g3 = 234, substituting:

437 + 2*(234) +3y = 437 + 468 +3y = 905 +3y.

Set equal to 1124:

905 +3y = 1124.

3y = 219 => y=73.

So, that must be correct. So, the number of residents who own all four is 73.

But let me verify with another approach.

Alternatively, let's think of the inclusion-exclusion principle but only for D, G, S, since H is universal.

Wait, the problem says each resident owns H, so the four items are H, D, G, S.

But since H is always included, the total number of people owning at least one of D, G, S is equal to all 900 residents.

So, using inclusion-exclusion for D, G, S:

|D ∪ G ∪ S| = |D| + |G| + |S| - |D∩G| - |D∩S| - |G∩S| + |D∩G∩S|.

But |D ∪ G ∪ S| = 900.

Because everyone owns H, so the union of D, G, S is the entire population.

So, substituting:

195 + 367 + 562 - |D∩G| - |D∩S| - |G∩S| + |D∩G∩S| = 900.

Let me compute 195 + 367 + 562.

195 + 367 = 562; 562 + 562 = 1124.

So, 1124 - (|D∩G| + |D∩S| + |G∩S|) + |D∩G∩S| = 900.

Rearranging:

(|D∩G| + |D∩S| + |G∩S|) - |D∩G∩S| = 1124 -900 = 224.

Hmm, that's equation A: (|D∩G| + |D∩S| + |G∩S|) - |D∩G∩S| = 224.

But what do these intersections represent?

Each |D∩G| includes those who own D, G, and possibly other things (including H, which is everyone). So, |D∩G| is the number of people who own both D and G, regardless of S. Similarly for the others.

But |D∩G∩S| is the number who own all three, which is the same as |D∩G∩S|, which includes H as well since everyone has H.

Wait, but the problem says 234 own exactly three things. So, the number of people who own exactly three is 234, which would be the sum of H, D, G; H, D, S; and H, G, S.

Which is d2 + d3 + g3 = 234.

But also, |D∩G| is the number of people who own D and G, regardless of S. So, |D∩G| = number of people who own H, D, G (d2) plus those who own H, D, G, S (y). So, |D∩G| = d2 + y.

Similarly, |D∩S| = d3 + y.

|G∩S| = g3 + y.

So, now, equation A becomes:

(|D∩G| + |D∩S| + |G∩S|) - |D∩G∩S| = 224.

Substituting:

[(d2 + y) + (d3 + y) + (g3 + y)] - (d2 + d3 + g3 + y) = 224.

Simplify inside the brackets:

d2 + y + d3 + y + g3 + y = (d2 + d3 + g3) + 3y.

Then, subtract (d2 + d3 + g3 + y):

(d2 + d3 + g3 + 3y) - (d2 + d3 + g3 + y) = 2y.

So, equation A simplifies to 2y = 224.

Thus, y = 112.

Wait, but wait, that's conflicting with the earlier result of y=73.

Hmm, conflicting results. Now I'm really confused. Where did I go wrong?

Wait, let me go back. In equation A, |D∩G| + |D∩S| + |G∩S| - |D∩G∩S| = 224.

But |D∩G| is d2 + y.

Similarly for the others.

So, (d2 + y) + (d3 + y) + (g3 + y) - (d2 + d3 + g3 + y) = ?

Let me compute this step by step.

First, expand the terms:

(d2 + y) + (d3 + y) + (g3 + y) = d2 + d3 + g3 + 3y.

Then, subtract (d2 + d3 + g3 + y):

= (d2 + d3 + g3 + 3y) - (d2 + d3 + g3 + y) = 2y.

So, 2y = 224 => y=112.

Hmm, but earlier when adding the three equations, I got y=73.

There's a contradiction here. Which one is correct?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the earlier approach. Let me check.

Earlier, I added equations 1,2,3 and got 437 + 2*(234) + 3y = 1124, leading to y=73.

But in the inclusion-exclusion approach, I got y=112.

So, which is correct?

Wait, I think the mistake is in the initial approach. Because when I added equations 1,2,3, I accounted for each variable correctly, but perhaps that approach was wrong.

Wait, let me think again about the variables.

Equation 1: d1 + d2 + d3 + y =195.

Equation2: g1 + d2 + g3 + y=367.

Equation3: s1 + d3 + g3 + y=562.

Equation4: d1+g1+s1=437.

Equation5: d2 +d3 +g3=234.

Equation6: x+y=229.

If I add equations1+2+3:

d1 + g1 + s1 + 2d2 + 2d3 + 2g3 + 3y = 195+367+562=1124.

But from equation4: d1+g1+s1=437.

From equation5: d2+d3+g3=234.

So, 437 + 2*(234) +3y = 437 + 468 +3y=905 +3y=1124.

So, 3y=1124-905=219 => y=73.

But according to inclusion-exclusion, I get y=112.

So, there's a conflict. Therefore, I must have made a mistake in one of the approaches.

Wait, let's think about what y represents. In the first approach, y is the number of people who own all four items, which, since H is universal, y is the number of people who own D, G, S, and H.

In the inclusion-exclusion approach, |D∩G∩S| is the number of people who own D, G, S, which is exactly y, because H is already included in everyone.

So, in the inclusion-exclusion equation, |D∩G∩S|=y.

So, equation A: 2y=224, so y=112.

But according to the first approach, y=73.

So, why the discrepancy?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in defining the variables in the first approach.

Let me re-examine the first approach.

In the first approach, the three equations for D, G, S are:

1. d1 + d2 + d3 + y =195.

2. g1 + d2 + g3 + y=367.

3. s1 + d3 + g3 + y=562.

These equations sum up to 195+367+562=1124.

But when adding equations 1,2,3, I get:

d1 + g1 + s1 + 2d2 + 2d3 + 2g3 +3y=1124.

Substituting equation4 and 5:

437 + 2*(234) +3y=1124.

Which gives 437 +468 +3y=905 +3y=1124.

So, 3y=219 => y=73.

But according to inclusion-exclusion, y=112.

Hmm, the two methods are giving different results. So, which one is correct?

Wait, perhaps there's a mistake in the inclusion-exclusion approach.

Wait, inclusion-exclusion gives |D ∪ G ∪ S|=900.

So, |D| + |G| + |S| - |D∩G| - |D∩S| - |G∩S| + |D∩G∩S|=900.

Which is 195+367+562 - (|D∩G| + |D∩S| + |G∩S|) + |D∩G∩S|=900.

But |D∩G| is the number of people who own both D and G, which is the same as the number who own D, G, and possibly S and H. So, |D∩G|=d2 + y + (those who own D, G, and S, which is y). Wait, no.

Wait, |D∩G| is the number of people who own both D and G, regardless of S. So, these include:

- Those who own only D, G, and H: d2.

- Those who own D, G, H, and S: y.

So, |D∩G|=d2 + y.

Similarly, |D∩S|=d3 + y.

|G∩S|=g3 + y.

So, substituting into inclusion-exclusion:

195 + 367 + 562 - [ (d2 + y) + (d3 + y) + (g3 + y) ] + (d2 + d3 + g3 + y) =900.

Simplify:

1124 - [d2 + y + d3 + y + g3 + y] + [d2 + d3 + g3 + y] =900.

Which becomes:

1124 - [ (d2 + d3 + g3) + 3y ] + [ (d2 + d3 + g3) + y ] =900.

Simplify inside:

1124 - d2 - d3 -g3 -3y +d2 +d3 +g3 + y =900.

The d2, d3, g3 terms cancel out:

1124 -3y + y =900.

So, 1124 -2y =900.

Which gives 2y=1124-900=224.

So, y=112.

So, according to this, y=112.

But according to the first approach, y=73.

So, why the difference?

Ah! I think I found the mistake.

In the first approach, I considered the three equations for D, G, S.

Equation1: d1 + d2 + d3 + y =195.

Equation2: g1 + d2 + g3 + y=367.

Equation3: s1 + d3 + g3 + y=562.

But when adding these, I get:

d1 + g1 + s1 + 2d2 + 2d3 + 2g3 +3y=1124.

But I substituted d1 +g1+s1=437 and d2+d3+g3=234, leading to 437 + 2*234 +3y=905 +3y=1124.

Which gives y=73.

But according to inclusion-exclusion, y=112.

So, which one is correct.

Wait, perhaps the error is in the initial definitions of the variables.

Wait, in the first approach, equation3 is s1 + d3 + g3 + y=562.

But s1 is the number of people who own only H and S.

d3 is the number who own H, D, S.

g3 is the number who own H, G, S.

y is the number who own all four.

But wait, perhaps in equation3, s1 is correct, but d3 and g3 are those who own exactly H, D, S and H, G, S. So, the counts for S owners is:

s1 (H,S) + d3 (H,D,S) + g3 (H,G,S) + y (H,D,G,S) =562.

Which is correct.

So, equations 1,2,3 and 4,5,6 should hold.

But according to inclusion-exclusion, we get a different result for y.

Hmm, perhaps the first approach is missing something.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the confusion is about what |D∩G∩S| represents. In the inclusion-exclusion, it's the number of people who own D, G, S, which is y, because everyone owns H.

So, in the inclusion-exclusion, |D∩G∩S|=y.

But in the first approach, when I added the three equations, I had:

(d1 +g1+s1) + 2*(d2+d3+g3) +3y=1124.

Which, substituting the knowns, gives y=73.

But in inclusion-exclusion, we get y=112.

So, which is correct?

Wait, perhaps I can calculate the total number of people owning exactly two, exactly three, and four, and see if that adds up.

From the first approach:

y=73.

Then, from equation5: d2 +d3 +g3=234.

From equation4: d1 +g1 +s1=437.

From equation6: x +73=229 =>x=156.

So, total people:

x=156 (only H),

d1 +g1 +s1=437 (exactly two),

d2 +d3 +g3=234 (exactly three),

y=73 (exactly four).

Total:156+437+234+73=900. Correct.

But according to the inclusion-exclusion, y=112.

So, let's see what that gives.

If y=112, then equation6: x +112=229 =>x=117.

Then, equation5: d2 +d3 +g3=234.

Equation4: d1 +g1 +s1=437.

But we would need to see if the sum of equations1+2+3 is correct.

Equation1: d1 +d2 +d3 +112=195 =>d1 +d2 +d3=83.

Equation2: g1 +d2 +g3 +112=367 =>g1 +d2 +g3=255.

Equation3: s1 +d3 +g3 +112=562 =>s1 +d3 +g3=450.

Now, adding equations1,2,3:

(d1 +d2 +d3) + (g1 +d2 +g3) + (s1 +d3 +g3) =83 +255 +450=788.

Which is d1 +g1 +s1 +2d2 +2d3 +2g3=788.

From equation4: d1 +g1 +s1=437.

So, 437 + 2*(d2 +d3 +g3)=788.

But from equation5: d2 +d3 +g3=234.

So, 2*234=468.

437 +468=905.

But 905 ≠788.

So, that's a contradiction.

So, this suggests that y=112 is not feasible, because it leads to inconsistency.

Therefore, y must be 73.

Hmm, but in the inclusion-exclusion approach, I found y=112. So, which one is correct?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the inclusion-exclusion approach.

Wait, let's go back to the inclusion-exclusion.

We have |D ∪ G ∪ S|=900.

Which is equal to 195 +367 +562 - |D∩G| - |D∩S| - |G∩S| + |D∩G∩S|.

So, 195+367+562=1124.

So, 1124 - (|D∩G| + |D∩S| + |G∩S|) + |D∩G∩S|=900.

So, |D∩G| + |D∩S| + |G∩S| - |D∩G∩S|=224.

But |D∩G|=d2 + y.

Similarly for others.

So, substituting:

(d2 + y) + (d3 + y) + (g3 + y) - (d2 + d3 + g3 + y)=224.

Which is (d2 + d3 + g3 +3y) - (d2 +d3 +g3 +y)=2y=224.

Thus, y=112.

Which seems to suggest that y=112.

But when we plug that back into the first approach, it leads to inconsistency.

But according to the first approach, the variables satisfy all equations when y=73.

Hmm.

This is confusing. Perhaps the mistake is in the inclusion-exclusion approach.

Wait, wait, another thought: the inclusion-exclusion counts the union as 900, which is correct because everyone owns H, so the union of D, G, S is the entire population.

But when we calculate |D∩G|, etc., perhaps they include more than just the people owning exactly two or three items.

Wait, actually, |D∩G| includes all people who own D and G, regardless of their ownership of S. So, that includes:

- Those who own D, G, and H only: d2.

- Those who own D, G, H, and S: y.

So, |D∩G|=d2 + y.

Same for |D∩S|=d3 + y.

|G∩S|=g3 + y.

So, substituting into inclusion-exclusion:

195 + 367 +562 - (d2 + y + d3 + y + g3 + y) + (d2 +d3 +g3 + y) =900.

Simplify:

1124 - (d2 +d3 +g3 +3y) + (d2 +d3 +g3 + y) =900.

So, 1124 -d2 -d3 -g3 -3y +d2 +d3 +g3 + y =900.

Which becomes 1124 -2y=900.

Thus, 2y=224 => y=112.

So, this approach gives y=112.

But when I tried plugging that into the first method, it didn't add up.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the first approach's variables.

In equation3: s1 +d3 +g3 +y=562.

If y=112, then s1 +d3 +g3=562-112=450.

But from equation5: d2 +d3 +g3=234.

So, d3 +g3=234 -d2.

Substituting into equation3:

s1 + (234 -d2) =450.

So, s1=450 -234 +d2=216 +d2.

From equation2: g1 +d2 +g3 +112=367 =>g1 +d2 +g3=255.

But g3=234 -d2 -d3.

Wait, equation5: d2 +d3 +g3=234 =>g3=234 -d2 -d3.

Substituting into equation2:

g1 +d2 + (234 -d2 -d3) =255.

Simplify:

g1 +234 -d3=255 =>g1=255-234 +d3=21 +d3.

From equation4: d1 +g1 +s1=437.

We have s1=216 +d2.

g1=21 +d3.

So, substituting:

d1 + (21 +d3) + (216 +d2) =437.

Simplify:

d1 +d2 +d3 +237=437.

Thus, d1 +d2 +d3=200.

From equation1: d1 +d2 +d3 +y=195.

But y=112, so d1 +d2 +d3=195 -112=83.

But from above, d1 +d2 +d3=200.

Contradiction: 83=200. Not possible.

So, this suggests that y=112 is impossible.

So, where is the mistake?

Wait, perhaps the inclusion-exclusion approach is wrong because in the problem statement, the counts for exactly two and exactly three are given. So, perhaps the inclusion-exclusion needs to be adjusted.

Alternatively, perhaps the first approach is correct, leading to y=73.

But then, in the inclusion-exclusion approach, I get y=112, which leads to a contradiction.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that the inclusion-exclusion approach is not considering that some of the intersections include people who own all four. So, when I subtract |D∩G|, |D∩S|, |G∩S|, I've subtracted the y three times and added it once.

Wait, no, because in inclusion-exclusion, it's:

|D| + |G| + |S| - |D∩G| - |D∩S| - |G∩S| + |D∩G∩S|.

And substituting |D∩G|=d2 + y, etc., so:

195 +367 +562 - (d2 + y +d3 + y +g3 + y) + (d2 +d3 +g3 + y)=900.

Which becomes 1124 - (d2 +d3 +g3 +3y) + (d2 +d3 +g3 +y)=900.

Simplify: 1124 -2y=900 => y=112.

But according to the first approach, y=73.

This is a problem. It seems both approaches should be consistent, but they are not.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that in the inclusion-exclusion, |D∩G∩S| is equal to y, but in reality, |D∩G∩S| is the number of people who own D, G, S, which is y. Because everyone owns H, so the only way to own D, G, S is to have H as well, so y is |D∩G∩S|.

Thus, the inclusion-exclusion approach should be correct, leading to y=112.

But the first approach is also correct, leading to y=73.

This is a contradiction.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that the initial assumption that D, G, S are subsets of H is correct, but the way we're defining the equations in the first approach is wrong.

Let me try to think again.

Let me model the problem using the principle of inclusion-exclusion, but considering the exact counts.

We have:

Total:900.

Number owning exactly two:437.

Number owning exactly three:234.

Number owning exactly four:y.

Number owning exactly one:x.

So, x +437 +234 +y=900.

So, x + y=229.

Now, the total number of people owning D is 195, which includes:

- Those owning exactly D and H: d1.

- Those owning exactly D, H, and one other: (d2, d3).

- Those owning exactly D, H, and two others: y.

Similarly for G and S.

So, |D|=d1 +d2 +d3 + y=195.

Similarly, |G|=g1 +d2 +g3 + y=367.

|S|=s1 +d3 +g3 + y=562.

And we know:

d1 +g1 +s1=437.

d2 +d3 +g3=234.

So, from |D|: d1 +d2 +d3=195 -y.

From |G|: g1 +d2 +g3=367 - y.

From |S|: s1 +d3 +g3=562 - y.

Now, let's add these three equations:

(d1 +d2 +d3) + (g1 +d2 +g3) + (s1 +d3 +g3) = (195 -y) + (367 -y) + (562 -y).

Left side: d1 +g1 +s1 + 2d2 + 2d3 + 2g3.

Right side: 195+367+562 -3y=1124 -3y.

But from earlier, we have:

d1 +g1 +s1=437.

d2 +d3 +g3=234.

So, substituting into left side: 437 + 2*(234) =437 +468=905.

Thus, 905=1124 -3y.

So, 3y=1124 -905=219.

Thus, y=73.

So, this approach gives y=73.

Which is consistent with the first approach.

But earlier, the inclusion-exclusion approach gave y=112, which led to a contradiction.

So, where is the error in the inclusion-exclusion approach?

Wait, perhaps the inclusion-exclusion approach is not considering that the intersections include exactly two, three, and four.

Wait, perhaps the error is that |D∩G| includes not only exactly two (d2) and exactly four (y), but also exactly three (d2 is exactly three, which includes H, D, G). Wait, no, d2 is exactly three, which is H, D, G.

Wait, but |D∩G| is the number of people who own both D and G, regardless of S. So, those who own D, G, and H only are d2.

Those who own D, G, H, and S are y.

So, |D∩G|=d2 + y.

Similarly for others.

So, in the inclusion-exclusion formula:

|D| + |G| + |S| - |D∩G| - |D∩S| - |G∩S| + |D∩G∩S| = |D ∪ G ∪ S|.

Which is 900.

So, substituting:

195 +367 +562 - (d2 + y +d3 + y +g3 + y) + (d2 +d3 +g3 + y)=900.

Which becomes:

1124 - (d2 +d3 +g3 +3y) + (d2 +d3 +g3 +y)=900.

Simplify: 1124 -2y=900.

Thus, 2y=224 => y=112.

But according to the other approach, y=73.

So, which is correct?

Well, in the first approach, when we model the equations based on the exact counts, we get y=73.

And when we plug y=73 into the inclusion-exclusion, what happens?

Let me compute:

From inclusion-exclusion,

|D ∪ G ∪ S|=900.

Which is equal to |D| + |G| + |S| - |D∩G| - |D∩S| - |G∩S| + |D∩G∩S|.

We have:

|D|=195, |G|=367, |S|=562.

|D∩G|=d2 + y= d2 +73.

|D∩S|=d3 +73.

|G∩S|=g3 +73.

|D∩G∩S|=y=73.

So, substitution:

195 +367 +562 - (d2 +73 +d3 +73 +g3 +73) +73=900.

Compute:

1124 - (d2 +d3 +g3 + 219) +73=900.

We know that d2 +d3 +g3=234.

So:

1124 - (234 +219) +73=900.

Calculate:

234 +219=453.

So, 1124 -453 +73=900.

1124 -453=671. 671 +73=744.

But 744≠900.

Hmm, so this suggests that when y=73, the inclusion-exclusion does not hold.

But this is a contradiction, because both approaches should align.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that in the first approach, I forgot that |D∩G∩S|=y is included in |D∩G|, |D∩S|, |G∩S|.

Thus, when I subtract |D∩G|, |D∩S|, |G∩S|, I've subtracted y three times, and added it once. So, total subtraction is 3y, addition is y. So net effect is -2y.

Which is correct as per inclusion-exclusion.

But according to the first approach, when y=73, the inclusion-exclusion doesn't hold.

But according to the first approach, when y=73, the equations are consistent.

But when y=73, the inclusion-exclusion gives 744 instead of 900.

This is a problem.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that the inclusion-exclusion formula is not applicable here because H is included in all, and the counts for D, G, S include H.

Wait, but no, H is not one of the sets in the inclusion-exclusion; we're only considering D, G, S.

But since all residents own H, the union of D, G, S is 900.

Wait, but perhaps the way I'm calculating the inclusion-exclusion is incorrect because D, G, S are subsets of H.

Wait, perhaps I should think of H as the universal set, and model the problem using H, D, G, S.

Wait, but in that case, the inclusion-exclusion becomes more complicated.

Wait, perhaps the initial approach is correct, and y=73, and the inclusion-exclusion approach is not applicable because H is already included.

Alternatively, perhaps the inclusion-exclusion approach is being miscalculated.

Wait, perhaps I should model it as four sets, including H.

Wait, but H is the universal set, so all other sets are subsets of H.

Thus, the inclusion-exclusion for four sets, but since H is universal, it's just the union of D, G, S equals H.

So, perhaps the inclusion-exclusion formula for four sets is not necessary, but for three sets D, G, S within H.

Wait, in that case, the inclusion-exclusion would be:

|D ∪ G ∪ S|= |D| + |G| + |S| - |D∩G| - |D∩S| - |G∩S| + |D∩G∩S|.

But since |D ∪ G ∪ S|=900, because everyone owns H, which is the universal set.

So, substituting:

195 +367 +562 - (|D∩G| + |D∩S| + |G∩S|) + |D∩G∩S|=900.

Which leads to 1124 - (sum of pairwise intersections) + |D∩G∩S|=900.

Which gives sum of pairwise intersections - |D∩G∩S|=224.

But the sum of pairwise intersections is |D∩G| + |D∩S| + |G∩S|.

But as established, each pairwise intersection is the sum of exactly three (d2, etc.) and exactly four (y).

So, |D∩G|=d2 + y.

Similarly for others.

So, sum of pairwise intersections= (d2 +y)+(d3 +y)+(g3 +y)=d2 +d3 +g3 +3y=234 +3y.

Thus, equation becomes:

(234 +3y) - y=224.

Which is 234 +2y=224.

Wait, 234 +2y=224 => 2y= -10. Which is impossible.

Wait, that can't be.

Wait, perhaps I have the equation wrong.

Earlier, from inclusion-exclusion:

sum of pairwise intersections - |D∩G∩S|=224.

But sum of pairwise intersections is (d2 +d3 +g3) +3y=234 +3y.

Thus, (234 +3y) - y=224.

Which is 234 +2y=224.

Thus, 2y= -10 => y=-5. Which is impossible.

Wait, that can't be right.

So, that suggests that the inclusion-exclusion approach is leading to an impossible y, which can't be.

So, that implies that perhaps the inclusion-exclusion approach is not applicable here, or perhaps the initial assumptions are wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is that the counts for exactly two and exactly three are not compatible with the given set sizes.

But this is getting too complicated.

Given that in the first approach, using the equations based on the exact counts, we get y=73, and that when we plug y=73 into the inclusion-exclusion, we get a contradiction, but the equations are consistent with each other.

Alternatively, perhaps the inclusion-exclusion approach is incorrect because the pairwise intersections include people who own all four, which is not accounted for correctly.

Wait, perhaps the correct way is to accept that in the first approach, the equations are consistent and yield y=73, so that must be the correct answer.

Therefore, the number of residents who own all four items is 73.
