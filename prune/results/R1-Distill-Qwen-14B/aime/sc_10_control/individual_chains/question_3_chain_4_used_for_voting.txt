Okay, so I need to figure out this probability problem about Jen and the lottery. Let me try to understand the problem step by step.

Jen is entering a lottery where she picks 4 distinct numbers from the set S = {1,2,3,...,10}. Then, 4 numbers are randomly chosen from S. She wins a prize if at least two of her numbers match the randomly chosen numbers. She wins the grand prize if all four of her numbers match.

The question is asking for the probability that she won the grand prize given that she won a prize. This is a conditional probability problem, so I remember that conditional probability formula: P(A|B) = P(A ∩ B) / P(B). But in this case, if she won the grand prize, she must have won a prize because winning the grand prize is a subset of winning a prize. So, actually, P(A ∩ B) is just P(A), since A is a subset of B. Therefore, P(A|B) = P(A)/P(B).

So, I need to compute two probabilities: the probability that she wins the grand prize (which is the probability that all four of her numbers are chosen), and the probability that she wins a prize (which is the probability that at least two of her numbers are chosen). Then, I'll divide the grand prize probability by the prize probability.

Let me break this down.

First, the total number of ways to choose 4 numbers from 10 is C(10,4). That's the denominator for all probabilities.

Calculating C(10,4): 10! / (4! * (10-4)!) = (10*9*8*7)/(4*3*2*1) = 210. So, the total possible combinations are 210.

Now, the probability of winning the grand prize: that's the probability that all four of her numbers are chosen. There's only one such combination, which is her exact set of four numbers. So, the number of favorable outcomes is 1. Therefore, P(grand prize) = 1/210.

Next, the probability of winning a prize is the probability that at least two of her numbers are chosen. This includes two scenarios: exactly two numbers match, exactly three numbers match, and exactly four numbers match. So, we need to calculate the number of ways for each of these and sum them up.

Alternatively, since it's "at least two," another approach is to calculate 1 minus the probability of having fewer than two matches, i.e., 1 minus (probability of zero matches + probability of exactly one match). That might be simpler.

Let me try that. First, compute the number of ways to choose 4 numbers with exactly k matches, where k is 0,1,2,3,4.

Wait, let's define it more clearly. For a given set of 4 numbers that Jen has, how many ways can the lottery choose 4 numbers such that exactly k numbers are in common with Jen's set.

So, for exactly k matches: the lottery must choose k numbers from Jen's 4, and the remaining (4 - k) numbers from the numbers not in Jen's set. Since the total set S has 10 numbers, and Jen has picked 4, the numbers not in her set are 6. So, the number of ways for exactly k matches is C(4,k) * C(6,4 - k).

Wait, no: the total numbers chosen in the lottery are 4, so if k are from Jen's set, the remaining (4 - k) must be from the 6 numbers not in her set. So yes, the formula is correct.

So, the number of ways for exactly k matches is C(4,k)*C(6,4−k).

Therefore, the number of ways for at least two matches is the sum from k=2 to k=4 of C(4,k)*C(6,4−k).

Alternatively, 1 minus [C(4,0)*C(6,4) + C(4,1)*C(6,3)].

Let me compute both ways to verify.

First, let's compute the number of ways for exactly 0 matches: C(4,0)*C(6,4). C(4,0)=1, C(6,4)=15. So, 1*15=15.

Exactly 1 match: C(4,1)*C(6,3). C(4,1)=4, C(6,3)=20. So, 4*20=80.

So, the number of ways for fewer than two matches is 15 + 80 = 95.

Therefore, the number of ways for at least two matches is total combinations minus 95: 210 - 95 = 115.

Alternatively, let's compute the sum for k=2,3,4.

Exactly 2 matches: C(4,2)*C(6,2) = 6 * 15 = 90.

Exactly 3 matches: C(4,3)*C(6,1) = 4 * 6 = 24.

Exactly 4 matches: C(4,4)*C(6,0) = 1 * 1 = 1.

So, summing these: 90 + 24 + 1 = 115. Same result.

So, the number of favorable outcomes for winning a prize is 115.

Therefore, the probability of winning a prize is 115/210.

Simplify that fraction: 115 and 210 are both divisible by 5. 115 ÷ 5 =23, 210 ÷5=42. So, 23/42.

So, P(prize) = 23/42.

And the probability of winning the grand prize was 1/210.

Wait, but earlier I thought of the conditional probability as P(grand prize) / P(prize), which is (1/210) / (115/210) = 1/115.

Wait, but let me check that. Because P(grand prize) is 1/210, and P(prize) is 115/210. So, 1/210 divided by 115/210 is 1/115.

But wait, 1/115 is that the correct probability? Let me think again.

Wait, another thought: the grand prize is a specific case where all four numbers match, which is included in the prize scenarios. So, the conditional probability is indeed P(grand prize) / P(prize) = (1/210) / (115/210) = 1/115.

So, the probability is 1/115. The problem states that this probability is m/n, where m and n are coprime. So, m=1, n=115. Are they coprime? Yes, because 1 and 115 share no common divisors other than 1.

Wait, 115 factors into 5*23, and 1 shares no common factors with either. So yes, m=1, n=115, so m+n=1+115=116.

Wait, but hold on a second. Is that correct? Let me double-check the numbers.

Total number of ways: C(10,4)=210. Correct.

Number of ways to win the grand prize: 1. Correct.

Number of ways to win a prize: number of ways where at least two numbers match. We calculated that as 115, so 115/210=23/42.

So, the conditional probability is 1/210 divided by 115/210=1/115. So, yes, 1/115.

Therefore, m=1, n=115, m+n=116.

Wait, but let me think another way. Maybe I made a mistake in calculating the numbers for prize.

Wait, when I calculated the number of ways to have at least two matches, I got 115. But let's think about it differently. The number of ways the lottery can choose 4 numbers with at least two overlapping with Jen's 4 is 115. Therefore, the probability is 115/210=23/42.

So, the conditional probability is (1/210) / (115/210)=1/115.

Another way: The conditional probability is the probability that all four match given that at least two match. So, in other words, the number of ways where all four match is 1, and the number of ways where at least two match is 115. Therefore, the probability is 1/115.

Alternatively, perhaps another approach is to think using hypergeometric distribution.

But I think my initial approach was correct.

Wait, but let me verify the number of ways to have exactly k matches.

For exactly two matches: C(4,2) * C(6,2)=6 * 15=90.

Exactly three: C(4,3)*C(6,1)=4 *6=24.

Exactly four: C(4,4)*C(6,0)=1*1=1.

Total: 90+24+1=115. Correct.

So, the number of ways is 115.

Thus, the probability of at least two is 115/210, which reduces to 23/42.

So, the conditional probability is (1/210)/(115/210)=1/115.

So, m=1, n=115, so m+n=116.

Wait, but wait: I have a doubt here. Because 1/210 is the number of ways to get four matches, and 115 is the number of ways to get at least two matches. So, 1/115 is the probability.

But, is there another way to compute this?

Alternatively, think of it as the conditional probability where given that at least two numbers match, what's the probability that all four match.

In combinatorics, another way to think about conditional probability is:

Number of favorable cases for both A and B, divided by number of favorable cases for B.

But in this case, A is winning the grand prize, which is a subset of B (winning a prize). So, the number of favorable cases for A is 1, and the number of favorable cases for B is 115. So, the conditional probability is 1/115.

Therefore, yes, 1/115 is correct. So, 1+115=116.

I think that's solid.

To determine the probability that Jen wins the grand prize given that she won a prize, we use conditional probability. Let \( A \) be the event that Jen wins the grand prize, and \( B \) be the event that she wins a prize. We need to find \( P(A|B) = \frac{P(A)}{P(B)} \).

1. **Total number of ways to choose 4 numbers from 10**:  
   \[
   \binom{10}{4} = 210
   \]

2. **Probability of winning the grand prize (\( P(A) \))**:  
   There is only one way to choose all four of Jen's numbers, so:
   \[
   P(A) = \frac{1}{210}
   \]

3. **Probability of winning a prize (\( P(B) \))**:  
   This includes having at least two matches. We calculate this by subtracting the probabilities of having fewer than two matches from 1.

   - **Number of ways with exactly 0 matches**:  
     \[
     \binom{4}{0} \binom{6}{4} = 1 \times 15 = 15
     \]
   
   - **Number of ways with exactly 1 match**:  
     \[
     \binom{4}{1} \binom{6}{3} = 4 \times 20 = 80
     \]
   
   - **Total ways with fewer than two matches**:  
     \[
     15 + 80 = 95
     \]
   
   - **Total ways with at least two matches**:  
     \[
     210 - 95 = 115
     \]
   
   Thus:
   \[
   P(B) = \frac{115}{210} = \frac{23}{42}
   \]

4. **Conditional probability \( P(A|B) \)**:  
   \[
   P(A|B) = \frac{P(A)}{P(B)} = \frac{\frac{1}{210}}{\frac{115}{210}} = \frac{1}{115}
   \]

The probability simplifies to \( \frac{1}{115} \), where \( m = 1 \) and \( n = 115 \). Therefore, \( m + n = 1 + 115 = 116 \).

\boxed{116}
