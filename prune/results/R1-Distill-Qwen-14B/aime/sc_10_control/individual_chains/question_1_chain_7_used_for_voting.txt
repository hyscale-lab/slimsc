Okay, so I've got this problem here with logarithms and three variables, x, y, and z. The problem gives me three equations involving logarithms base 2 of ratios of these variables. Then it's asking me to find the absolute value of log base 2 of (x^4 y^3 z^2), and express it as a fraction m/n where m and n are coprime, and then find m + n.

Hmm, let me start by writing down the given equations to get a clearer picture.

First equation: log₂(x/(y z)) = 1/2.

Second equation: log₂(y/(x z)) = 1/3.

Third equation: log₂(z/(x y)) = 1/4.

So, each of these logs equals a fraction, which suggests that each ratio inside the log is a power of 2. Since log₂(something) = a number, that means that the something is 2 raised to that number.

So, for the first equation, log₂(x/(y z)) = 1/2 implies that x/(y z) = 2^(1/2) = sqrt(2).

Similarly, the second equation: y/(x z) = 2^(1/3).

Third equation: z/(x y) = 2^(1/4).

Okay, so I can rewrite each of these as:

1. x = y z * sqrt(2)  => x = sqrt(2) y z.

2. y = x z * 2^(1/3) => y = 2^(1/3) x z.

3. z = x y * 2^(1/4) => z = 2^(1/4) x y.

Now, this gives me three equations with x, y, z in terms of each other. Maybe I can substitute them into each other to find expressions for x, y, z in terms of one variable or find a relationship between them.

Let me try substituting equation 2 into equation 1.

From equation 2: y = 2^(1/3) x z.

Plug this into equation 1: x = sqrt(2) * (2^(1/3) x z) * z.

Simplify the right side: x = sqrt(2) * 2^(1/3) * x * z^2.

So, x = (2^(1/2) * 2^(1/3)) x * z^2.

Wait, 2^(1/2) * 2^(1/3) is 2^(1/2 + 1/3) = 2^(5/6). So, x = 2^(5/6) x z^2.

Hmm, I can divide both sides by x (since x is positive, can't be zero). Then:

1 = 2^(5/6) z^2.

So, z^2 = 1 / 2^(5/6).

Which is the same as z^2 = 2^(-5/6).

Taking square roots: z = 2^(-5/12), since z is positive.

Wait, let me check: 2 * (-5/12) is -5/6, so yes, that's correct.

So z = 2^(-5/12).

Okay, so z is found. Now, can I use this to find y or x?

Looking back at equation 3: z = 2^(1/4) x y.

We know z is 2^(-5/12), so:

2^(-5/12) = 2^(1/4) x y.

Divide both sides by 2^(1/4):

x y = 2^(-5/12 - 1/4).

Let me compute the exponent: -5/12 - 1/4. Since 1/4 is 3/12, it's -5/12 - 3/12 = -8/12 = -2/3.

So, x y = 2^(-2/3).

So, equation A: x y = 2^(-2/3).

Now, from equation 2: y = 2^(1/3) x z.

We already know z is 2^(-5/12), so plug that in:

y = 2^(1/3) * x * 2^(-5/12).

Combine the exponents: 2^(1/3 - 5/12).

Let me compute 1/3 - 5/12. 1/3 is 4/12, so 4/12 - 5/12 = -1/12.

So, y = 2^(-1/12) x.

So equation B: y = x * 2^(-1/12).

Now, from equation A, x y = 2^(-2/3), and equation B gives y in terms of x.

Substitute B into A: x * (x * 2^(-1/12)) = 2^(-2/3).

Which is x^2 * 2^(-1/12) = 2^(-2/3).

So, x^2 = 2^(-2/3) / 2^(-1/12) = 2^(-2/3 + 1/12).

Compute exponent: -2/3 is -8/12, so -8/12 + 1/12 = -7/12.

So, x^2 = 2^(-7/12).

Thus, x = 2^(-7/24), since square root of 2^(-7/12) is 2^(-7/24).

Wait, let me verify that:

x^2 = 2^(-7/12) implies x = (2^(-7/12))^(1/2) = 2^(-7/(12*2)) = 2^(-7/24).

Yes, that's correct.

So x = 2^(-7/24).

Now, from equation B, y = x * 2^(-1/12) = 2^(-7/24) * 2^(-1/12).

Compute exponents: -7/24 - 1/12. 1/12 is 2/24, so -7/24 - 2/24 = -9/24 = -3/8.

So y = 2^(-3/8).

Then, from equation A: x y = 2^(-2/3), which we can check:

x y = 2^(-7/24) * 2^(-3/8).

Convert to same denominator: 24. So, -7/24 and -3/8 is -9/24.

So, total exponent: -7/24 -9/24 = -16/24 = -2/3. Yes, that's correct.

So, we have x, y, z:

x = 2^(-7/24) = 2^(-7/24).

y = 2^(-3/8) = 2^(-9/24).

z = 2^(-5/12) = 2^(-10/24).

Wait, maybe writing all in 24 denominators to see the pattern.

x: -7/24.

y: -9/24.

z: -10/24.

Hmm, maybe that's useful.

Now, the problem is to find |log₂(x^4 y^3 z^2)|.

First, let's compute x^4 y^3 z^2.

Since x, y, z are each powers of 2, their product will be 2 raised to the sum of exponents.

Let me compute exponents:

x^4: (2^(-7/24))^4 = 2^(-7/24 *4) = 2^(-7/6).

y^3: (2^(-3/8))^3 = 2^(-9/8).

z^2: (2^(-5/12))^2 = 2^(-5/6).

Multiply all together: x^4 y^3 z^2 = 2^(-7/6) * 2^(-9/8) * 2^(-5/6).

Since when multiplying same base, add exponents.

Compute total exponent: (-7/6) + (-9/8) + (-5/6).

First, let's get common denominators. 6 and 8 have LCM of 24.

Convert each:

-7/6 = -28/24.

-9/8 = -27/24.

-5/6 = -20/24.

Adding them together: (-28 -27 -20)/24 = (-75)/24.

Simplify: -75/24 can be reduced. Dividing numerator and denominator by 3: -25/8.

So, x^4 y^3 z^2 = 2^(-25/8).

So, log₂(x^4 y^3 z^2) = log₂(2^(-25/8)) = -25/8.

But the problem asks for the absolute value, so | -25/8 | = 25/8.

25 and 8 are coprime since 25 is 5^2 and 8 is 2^3, they share no common factors. So m =25, n=8, m +n=33.

Wait, that seems straightforward, but let me double-check my steps to ensure I didn't make a mistake.

First, the logs given were converted correctly into exponents:

x/(y z) = 2^(1/2), etc. Correct.

Then, substitution steps:

Substituted equation 2 into equation 1, found z^2 in terms of constants, solved for z, correct.

Then, plugged z into equation 3 to get x y = 2^(-2/3), correct.

Then, from equation 2, expressed y in terms of x, substituted into x y equation to find x, correct.

Got x, then y, then verified x y product.

Then, computed exponents for x^4, y^3, z^2 correctly.

Added exponents, converted to 24 denominators, correct.

Total exponent is (-25/8), so log is -25/8, absolute is 25/8.

Yes, seems correct.

To solve the problem, we start by converting the given logarithmic equations into their exponential forms:

1. \(\log_2\left(\frac{x}{yz}\right) = \frac{1}{2}\) implies \(\frac{x}{yz} = 2^{1/2} = \sqrt{2}\).
2. \(\log_2\left(\frac{y}{xz}\right) = \frac{1}{3}\) implies \(\frac{y}{xz} = 2^{1/3}\).
3. \(\log_2\left(\frac{z}{xy}\right) = \frac{1}{4}\) implies \(\frac{z}{xy} = 2^{1/4}\).

From these, we express \(x\), \(y\), and \(z\) in terms of each other:

1. \(x = \sqrt{2} \cdot yz\),
2. \(y = 2^{1/3} \cdot xz\),
3. \(z = 2^{1/4} \cdot xy\).

Substituting \(y = 2^{1/3} \cdot xz\) into \(x = \sqrt{2} \cdot yz\), we get:

\[
x = \sqrt{2} \cdot (2^{1/3} \cdot xz) \cdot z \implies x = 2^{5/6} \cdot x \cdot z^2 \implies z^2 = 2^{-5/6} \implies z = 2^{-5/12}.
\]

Next, substituting \(z = 2^{-5/12}\) into \(z = 2^{1/4} \cdot xy\), we find:

\[
2^{-5/12} = 2^{1/4} \cdot xy \implies xy = 2^{-2/3}.
\]

From \(y = 2^{-1/12} \cdot x\), substituting into \(xy = 2^{-2/3}\), we get:

\[
x \cdot (2^{-1/12} \cdot x) = 2^{-2/3} \implies x^2 = 2^{-7/12} \implies x = 2^{-7/24}.
\]

Then, \(y = 2^{-1/12} \cdot 2^{-7/24} = 2^{-3/8}\).

Now, we compute \(|\log_2(x^4 y^3 z^2)|\):

\[
x^4 = (2^{-7/24})^4 = 2^{-7/6}, \quad y^3 = (2^{-3/8})^3 = 2^{-9/8}, \quad z^2 = (2^{-5/12})^2 = 2^{-5/6}.
\]

Multiplying these:

\[
x^4 y^3 z^2 = 2^{-7/6} \cdot 2^{-9/8} \cdot 2^{-5/6} = 2^{-25/8}.
\]

Taking the logarithm:

\[
\log_2(x^4 y^3 z^2) = \log_2(2^{-25/8}) = -\frac{25}{8}.
\]

The absolute value is \(\left| -\frac{25}{8} \right| = \frac{25}{8}\). Thus, \(m = 25\), \(n = 8\), and \(m + n = 33\).

\(\boxed{33}\)
