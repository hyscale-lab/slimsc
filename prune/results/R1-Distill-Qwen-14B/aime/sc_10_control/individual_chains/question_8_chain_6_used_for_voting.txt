Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the number of triples of nonnegative integers (a, b, c) such that a + b + c = 300 and a²b + a²c + b²a + b²c + c²a + c²b = 6,000,000. Hmm, okay, let me try to unpack this step by step.

First, the equation a + b + c = 300 is straightforward. It's a linear equation with three variables, which means I can express one variable in terms of the other two. For example, c = 300 - a - b. Maybe substituting this into the second equation will help reduce the problem.

Looking at the second equation: a²b + a²c + b²a + b²c + c²a + c²b. Let me see if I can factor this or find a way to simplify it. Alternatively, perhaps I can write it as a sum of terms involving a², b², and c² multiplied by other variables.

Wait, let me try to group the terms differently. Notice that each term has two variables, one squared and multiplied by another. So maybe I can factor each pair:

a²b + a²c = a²(b + c)
Similarly, b²a + b²c = b²(a + c)
And c²a + c²b = c²(a + b)

So the entire expression becomes a²(b + c) + b²(a + c) + c²(a + b).

Hmm, that's a bit cleaner. Now, since a + b + c = 300, we can substitute (b + c) with (300 - a), and similarly for the others.

So substituting, we get:

a²(300 - a) + b²(300 - b) + c²(300 - c) = 6,000,000.

Let me write that out:

300a² - a³ + 300b² - b³ + 300c² - c³ = 6,000,000.

Which simplifies to:

300(a² + b² + c²) - (a³ + b³ + c³) = 6,000,000.

Hmm, okay. So I now have an equation involving a² + b² + c² and a³ + b³ + c³. Maybe I can find a way to relate these to the sum a + b + c.

I remember that for any three variables, there are some identities that relate sums of powers. Let me try to recall.

One identity I know is that:

(a + b + c)^3 = a³ + b³ + c³ + 3(a + b)(b + c)(c + a).

Wait, no, I think that's not quite right. Let me double-check. The correct identity is:

(a + b + c)^3 = a³ + b³ + c³ + 3(a + b)(b + c)(c + a) - 3abc.

Wait, maybe I should look up the expansion of (a + b + c)^3. Oh wait, I can't look it up, I have to think.

Right, the expansion is:

(a + b + c)^3 = a³ + b³ + c³ + 3a²b + 3a²c + 3ab² + 3ac² + 3b²c + 3bc² + 6abc.

Hmm, that's a lot. Let me rearrange that.

So, (a + b + c)^3 = a³ + b³ + c³ + 3(a²b + a²c + ab² + b²c + ac² + bc²) + 6abc.

Wait, that's exactly the form we have! Because in the problem statement, the second equation is a²b + a²c + b²a + b²c + c²a + c²b, which is equal to 2,000,000 when we divide 6,000,000 by 3? Wait, let me see.

Wait, no. Let me see: The second equation is a²b + a²c + b²a + b²c + c²a + c²b = 6,000,000.

Wait, in the expansion above, that term is 3*(a²b + a²c + ... ) = 3*(6,000,000). So, 3*(the second equation) is part of the expansion.

Wait, maybe I can express the second equation in terms of the expansion of (a + b + c)^3.

So, let's denote S = a + b + c = 300.

Then, S^3 = 300^3 = 27,000,000.

From the expansion:

S^3 = a³ + b³ + c³ + 3*(second equation) + 6abc.

So, rearranged:

a³ + b³ + c³ = S^3 - 3*(second equation) - 6abc.

But from the first transformed equation, we had:

300(a² + b² + c²) - (a³ + b³ + c³) = 6,000,000.

So, substituting a³ + b³ + c³ from above:

300(a² + b² + c²) - [S^3 - 3*(second equation) - 6abc] = 6,000,000.

But wait, the second equation is 6,000,000. So let me plug that in.

So:

300(a² + b² + c²) - [27,000,000 - 3*(6,000,000) - 6abc] = 6,000,000.

Wait, let's compute that step by step.

First, S^3 is 300^3 = 27,000,000.

Second equation is 6,000,000.

So, plugging into the expression for a³ + b³ + c³:

a³ + b³ + c³ = 27,000,000 - 3*(6,000,000) - 6abc.

Compute 3*(6,000,000) = 18,000,000.

So, a³ + b³ + c³ = 27,000,000 - 18,000,000 - 6abc = 9,000,000 - 6abc.

Now, substituting this into our earlier equation:

300(a² + b² + c²) - (9,000,000 - 6abc) = 6,000,000.

Let me write that:

300(a² + b² + c²) - 9,000,000 + 6abc = 6,000,000.

Bring the 9,000,000 to the other side:

300(a² + b² + c²) + 6abc = 15,000,000.

Hmm, that's a bit simpler.

Now, maybe I can factor out a 6:

6[50(a² + b² + c²) + abc] = 15,000,000.

Divide both sides by 6:

50(a² + b² + c²) + abc = 2,500,000.

Hmm, okay, so now we have:

50(a² + b² + c²) + abc = 2,500,000.

Hmm, not sure if that's immediately helpful. Alternatively, maybe I can find expressions for a² + b² + c² in terms of S and other terms.

I know that (a + b + c)^2 = a² + b² + c² + 2(ab + bc + ac).

So, given that S = 300, S² = 90,000.

Thus, a² + b² + c² = S² - 2(ab + bc + ac) = 90,000 - 2(ab + bc + ac).

So, substituting into our equation:

50*(90,000 - 2(ab + bc + ac)) + abc = 2,500,000.

Let me compute that:

50*90,000 = 4,500,000.

50*(-2(ab + bc + ac)) = -100(ab + bc + ac).

So, the equation becomes:

4,500,000 - 100(ab + bc + ac) + abc = 2,500,000.

Bring 4,500,000 to the right side:

-100(ab + bc + ac) + abc = 2,500,000 - 4,500,000 = -2,000,000.

Multiply both sides by (-1):

100(ab + bc + ac) - abc = 2,000,000.

Hmm, so:

100(ab + bc + ac) - abc = 2,000,000.

Let me write that as:

abc - 100(ab + bc + ac) = -2,000,000.

Alternatively, perhaps factor this expression. Let me see if I can factor it or find a substitution.

Let me denote t = ab + bc + ac.

Then, the equation becomes:

abc - 100t = -2,000,000.

But I also know that for three variables, we have:

(a + b + c)^3 = a^3 + b^3 + c^3 + 3t^2 - 3abc.

Wait, no, earlier expansion had S^3 = a^3 + b^3 + c^3 + 3t*(sum of a²b terms) + 6abc.

Wait, perhaps I need a different approach.

Wait, but maybe I can express abc in terms of t.

From the equation above:

abc = 100t - 2,000,000.

So, substituting this into the expression for a³ + b³ + c³.

Earlier, we had a³ + b³ + c³ = 9,000,000 - 6abc.

Which becomes:

a³ + b³ + c³ = 9,000,000 - 6*(100t - 2,000,000) = 9,000,000 - 600t + 12,000,000 = 21,000,000 - 600t.

Wait, but also, from S^3 = a^3 + b^3 + c^3 + 3*(sum of a²b terms) + 6abc.

Wait, but the sum of a²b terms is 6,000,000, so:

27,000,000 = (a^3 + b^3 + c^3) + 3*6,000,000 + 6abc.

Which is:

27,000,000 = (a^3 + b^3 + c^3) + 18,000,000 + 6abc.

So, rearranged:

a^3 + b^3 + c^3 = 27,000,000 - 18,000,000 - 6abc = 9,000,000 - 6abc.

Which matches what we had earlier. So that's consistent.

Alternatively, perhaps I can find another relation.

Wait, maybe I should consider symmetric functions.

Given that a, b, c are non-negative integers, perhaps assuming some order, like a ≤ b ≤ c, to reduce the cases, but given the problem's symmetry, maybe all permutations are possible.

Wait, but maybe it's better to approach this equation: 100(ab + bc + ac) - abc = 2,000,000.

Let me rewrite it as:

abc - 100(ab + bc + ac) = -2,000,000.

Hmm, perhaps factoring. Let's see:

abc - 100(ab + bc + ac) + 100^3 = -2,000,000 + 100^3.

Wait, where did that come from? Maybe adding 100^3 to both sides to factor.

Wait, 100^3 is 1,000,000.

So, left side becomes: (a - 100)(b - 100)(c - 100).

Wait, let me check that.

Let me compute (a - 100)(b - 100)(c - 100):

= abc - 100ab - 100ac - 100bc + 10,000a + 10,000b + 10,000c - 1,000,000.

Hmm, that's more complicated than what we have. Our target expression is abc - 100(ab + bc + ac) = -2,000,000.

So, not exactly matching. But perhaps I can manipulate it.

Let me see:

abc - 100(ab + bc + ac) = -2,000,000.

I can write this as:

abc = 100(ab + bc + ac) - 2,000,000.

Hmm, perhaps factor out 100:

abc = 100(ab + bc + ac - 20,000).

Hmm, not sure if that's helpful.

Alternatively, maybe I can divide both sides by abc, but that might not lead anywhere.

Wait, let me consider that a, b, c are non-negative integers. So, perhaps we can look for solutions where a, b, c are each 100 or so, but given that a + b + c = 300, maybe two of them are 100 each, or something like that.

Wait, but perhaps testing small values might not be feasible. Alternatively, maybe assuming that two variables are equal. Let me try assuming that a = b. Let's see how that plays out.

Assume a = b. Then, since a + b + c = 300, c = 300 - 2a.

Now, substitute into the second equation:

a²b + a²c + b²a + b²c + c²a + c²b.

Since a = b, this simplifies to:

a^3 + a^2c + a^3 + a^2c + c^2a + c^2a.

Which is 2a^3 + 2a^2c + 2c^2a.

Factor out 2a:

2a(a² + a c + c²).

So, the second equation becomes 2a(a² + a c + c²) = 6,000,000.

Divide both sides by 2a (assuming a ≠ 0):

a² + a c + c² = 3,000,000 / a.

Hmm, but since a is a positive integer, maybe we can find a such that 3,000,000 is divisible by a.

But also, c = 300 - 2a. So, substituting c:

a² + a(300 - 2a) + (300 - 2a)^2 = 3,000,000 / a.

Let me compute each term:

a² + 300a - 2a² + (90,000 - 1200a + 4a²) = 3,000,000 / a.

Simplify:

a² + 300a - 2a² + 90,000 -1200a +4a² = 3,000,000 /a.

Combine like terms:

(1 -2 +4)a² + (300a -1200a) + 90,000 = 3,000,000 /a.

So:

3a² -900a +90,000 = 3,000,000 /a.

Multiply both sides by a:

3a³ -900a² +90,000a = 3,000,000.

Divide both sides by 3:

a³ - 300a² + 30,000a -1,000,000 = 0.

Hmm, now we have a cubic equation in a:

a³ - 300a² + 30,000a -1,000,000 = 0.

Let me try to see if this cubic can be factored. Maybe using rational root theorem. Possible roots are factors of 1,000,000, which are numerous, but perhaps small ones.

Testing a=100:

100³ = 1,000,000.

-300*(100)^2 = -300*10,000= -3,000,000.

30,000*100=3,000,000.

-1,000,000.

So sum is 1,000,000 -3,000,000 +3,000,000 -1,000,000 = 0.

Yes! So a = 100 is a root. Therefore, (a - 100) is a factor.

So, let's perform polynomial division or factor it out.

Divide a³ -300a² +30,000a -1,000,000 by (a - 100).

Using synthetic division:

100 | 1   -300    30,000    -1,000,000

           100     -20,000      1,000,000

       1    -200    10,000          0

So, the cubic factors as (a - 100)(a² - 200a +10,000) = 0.

So, the quadratic factor is a² -200a +10,000.

Let me find its roots:

a = [200 ± sqrt(200^2 -4*1*10,000)] /2 = [200 ± sqrt(40,000 -40,000)]/2 = 200/2 = 100.

So, the quadratic is (a -100)^2. Thus, the cubic is (a -100)^3 =0.

Thus, a=100 is the only real root, with multiplicity 3.

Wait, that's interesting. So, when we assumed a = b, the only solution is a = b =100, which leads to c = 300 -2a = 300 - 200 = 100. So c=100.

So, the triple is (100,100,100). Let me check if this satisfies both equations.

First, a + b + c = 100 +100 +100 = 300, which works.

Second, a²b + a²c + ... Let's compute each term:

a²b = 100²*100 = 1,000,000.

Similarly, all six terms are 1,000,000, so total 6*1,000,000 = 6,000,000. So yes, this works.

So when a = b, the only solution is (100,100,100).

But this is just one particular case. Are there other solutions where a, b, c are not all equal?

Hmm, perhaps. Let me consider another approach. Maybe assuming that two variables are equal, but not necessarily a = b.

Wait, but in the case when a = b = c, we have the solution (100,100,100). So maybe other solutions exist where variables are not equal.

Wait, perhaps I can assume that one variable is zero, and see if that leads to a solution.

Let me suppose that c = 0. Then, a + b =300, and the second equation becomes a²b + a²*0 + b²a + b²*0 +0 +0 = a²b + b²a = ab(a + b) = ab*300.

So, the second equation is 300ab =6,000,000.

So, ab =6,000,000 /300 =20,000.

So, a + b =300 and ab=20,000.

So, we can solve for a and b. Let me consider the quadratic equation: x² -300x +20,000=0.

Compute discriminant: 300² -4*1*20,000 =90,000 -80,000=10,000.

So, sqrt(10,000)=100.

Thus, x=(300 ±100)/2 =200/2=100 or 400/2=200.

So, solutions are (a,b)=(100,200) or (200,100). So, when c=0, the possible triples are (100,200,0) and (200,100,0), along with permutations.

Wait, but wait, in this case, when c=0, a and b can be (100,200) or (200,100). But since a and b are symmetric, each of these is a different triple, but considering order, they are distinct.

But wait, in our problem, the triples are ordered, so (100,200,0) is different from (200,100,0), and both are different from (100,0,200), etc. So, the number of solutions when c=0 is 2: (100,200,0) and (200,100,0). But wait, actually, no, because a and b can be arranged in any order, so perhaps three times as much.

Wait, no, because c is fixed at 0. So, the possible triples are those where one variable is 0, and the other two are 100 and 200. So, the number of such triples is 3: because the zero can be in any of the three positions.

Wait, for example, (100,200,0), (200,100,0), (100,0,200), (200,0,100), (0,100,200), (0,200,100). Wait, that's 6 permutations, but in this case, c=0, so for each choice of which variable is zero, we have two possibilities for the other two variables, giving 3 positions each with two possibilities, so 6 triples.

Wait, but in our earlier calculation, for c=0, we had a=100, b=200 or a=200, b=100. So, that's two solutions for c=0, but more generally, for any variable being zero, say a=0, then we have b and c such that b + c=300 and b²c + c²b =300bc=6,000,000, so bc=20,000, similar to before, which would give us two solutions: (b,c)=(100,200) and (200,100). Similarly for b=0 and c=0.

So, each variable being zero gives two solutions, and there are three choices for which variable is zero, so 3 * 2 =6 solutions in total where one variable is zero.

So, that's six solutions.

Now, let's see if there are solutions where none of a, b, c is zero.

Let me suppose that a, b, c are all positive integers.

Hmm, but let's think about the equation we had earlier:

100(ab + bc + ac) - abc = 2,000,000.

Let me write this as:

abc -100(ab + bc + ac) = -2,000,000.

Hmm, perhaps I can write this as:

abc -100(ab + bc + ac) + 100^3 = 100^3 -2,000,000.

Which is 1,000,000 -2,000,000 = -1,000,000.

Wait, then:

abc -100(ab + bc + ac) + 100^3 = -1,000,000.

Hmm, but I was trying to factor this as (a -100)(b -100)(c -100). Let me compute (a-100)(b-100)(c-100):

= a b c -100 a b -100 a c -100 b c + 100^2 a + 100^2 b + 100^2 c - 100^3.

Which is abc -100(ab + ac + bc) +10,000(a + b + c) -1,000,000.

So, if I compare that to what I have:

abc -100(ab + bc + ac) = -2,000,000.

Hmm, so (a-100)(b-100)(c-100) = abc -100(ab + ac + bc) +10,000(a + b + c) -1,000,000.

Which is equal to (-2,000,000) +10,000*(300) -1,000,000.

Compute that:

-2,000,000 +3,000,000 -1,000,000 = 0.

So, (a-100)(b-100)(c-100) = 0.

Wait, that's a key insight! So, the equation (a-100)(b-100)(c-100) =0.

Which implies that at least one of (a -100), (b -100), or (c -100) is zero. So, at least one of a, b, c must be 100.

So, this is a crucial point.

So, this means that either a=100, b=100, or c=100.

So, we can partition the solutions into three cases:

1. a=100

2. b=100

3. c=100

But since the equation is symmetric in a, b, c, these cases are similar, so perhaps the number of solutions for each case is the same, and we can compute one and multiply by three, then subtract any overlaps if any.

Wait, but let me proceed step by step.

Case 1: a=100.

Then, since a + b + c=300, we have 100 + b + c =300 → b + c=200.

Now, the second equation is:

a^2b + a^2c + b^2a + b^2c + c^2a + c^2b =6,000,000.

Substituting a=100:

100²b + 100²c + b²*100 + b²c + c²*100 + c²b =6,000,000.

Compute each term:

100²b =10,000b

100²c=10,000c

b²*100=100b²

b²c =b²c

c²*100=100c²

c²b =c²b

So, summing all these:

10,000b +10,000c +100b² +b²c +100c² +c²b =6,000,000.

Let me factor terms where possible:

100b² +100c² +10,000b +10,000c +b²c +c²b.

Hmm, perhaps grouping terms:

100(b² + c²) +10,000(b + c) + bc(b + c).

Since b + c=200.

So, substitute:

100(b² + c²) +10,000*200 + bc*200.

Compute each part:

10,000*200=2,000,000.

bc*200=200bc.

Now, b² + c² can be written as (b + c)^2 -2bc =200^2 -2bc=40,000 -2bc.

So, substituting:

100*(40,000 -2bc) +2,000,000 +200bc.

Compute:

100*40,000=4,000,000.

100*(-2bc)=-200bc.

So, the equation becomes:

4,000,000 -200bc +2,000,000 +200bc =6,000,000.

Simplify:

4,000,000 +2,000,000 + (-200bc +200bc) =6,000,000.

Which is 6,000,000=6,000,000.

Hmm, that's an identity. So, any pair (b,c) such that b + c=200 satisfies the equation when a=100.

So, as long as a=100 and b + c=200, the second equation is satisfied.

So, how many solutions are there in this case?

Since a=100, and b and c are non-negative integers such that b + c=200.

The number of non-negative integer solutions is 201: since b can range from 0 to 200, and c=200 -b.

Each such pair gives a unique solution (100, b, c).

But wait, this includes the case where c=0 or b=0, which we've already considered earlier when we assumed one variable is zero.

Wait, but in the earlier analysis, when a=100 and b=200, c=0, and so on. So, in this case, the solutions where one variable is zero are included in this case.

But earlier, when we considered the case where, say, c=0, we found that a and b can be (100,200) or (200,100). So, when a=100, c=0, b=200 is a solution, and when b=100, c=0, a=200 is another solution, and when a=0, then b=100 and c=200, etc.

But in this case, when a=100, we have 201 solutions, including those where b or c is zero.

So, the same applies for the cases when b=100 or c=100.

So, for each case where a=100, b=100, or c=100, we have 201 solutions.

But wait, if we just multiply 201 by 3, we might be overcounting the cases where two variables are 100.

Wait, for example, when a=100 and b=100, then c=100. So, this triple is counted in all three cases: a=100, b=100, c=100. So, it's counted three times.

Similarly, in the case where a=100, b=200, c=0, this is counted once when a=100 and c=0, but not when b=100 or c=100, except when b=100, which is a different scenario.

Wait, perhaps it's better to compute the total number of solutions as 3*201 - 3*1 +1.

Wait, no, maybe using inclusion-exclusion.

Total solutions when a=100: 201.

Similarly for b=100 and c=100: each has 201.

But the overlap occurs when two variables are 100. So, for a=100 and b=100, c=100. Similarly for other pairs.

So, the number of such overlaps is 3: (100,100,100), (100,100,100), etc. But actually, each pair a=100 and b=100 implies c=100, so there is only one such triple where all three are 100.

Wait, no, the triple (100,100,100) is counted once in each of the three cases (a=100, b=100, c=100), so it's counted three times.

Similarly, the triples where two variables are 100 and the third is 100, but that's only one triple.

Wait, perhaps the inclusion-exclusion formula is:

Total = (number when a=100) + (number when b=100) + (number when c=100) - (number when a=100 and b=100) - (number when a=100 and c=100) - (number when b=100 and c=100) ) + (number when a=100 and b=100 and c=100).

So, let's compute each term.

Number when a=100: 201.

Similarly for b=100 and c=100: each 201.

Now, the number when a=100 and b=100: then c=300 -100 -100=100. So, only one solution: (100,100,100).

Similarly, when a=100 and c=100: b=100. So, same as above. Only one solution.

Same for b=100 and c=100: a=100, so same solution.

So, each pairwise intersection has one solution.

And the intersection of all three is also one solution.

So, applying inclusion-exclusion:

Total = 3*201 - 3*1 +1.

Which is 603 -3 +1 =601.

Wait, that can't be right. Because when a=100, the number of solutions is 201, which includes all cases where a=100, including those where b=100 or c=100.

Similarly for the other cases.

Wait, so the inclusion-exclusion formula is:

Total = |A| + |B| + |C| - |A∩B| - |A∩C| - |B∩C| + |A∩B∩C|,

where A is the set where a=100, B where b=100, C where c=100.

So,

|A| = |B| = |C| =201.

|A∩B| is the set where a=100 and b=100, so c=100, thus |A∩B|=1.

Similarly, |A∩C|=1, |B∩C|=1.

|A∩B∩C|=1.

Thus,

Total = 3*201 - 3*1 + 1 =603 -3 +1=601.

Hmm, but wait, in our earlier analysis, when a=100, the number of solutions is 201, which includes all possible (b,c) with b + c=200. So, each of these is a distinct triple, except when overlapping with other cases.

But according to inclusion-exclusion, the total number of triples where at least one of a, b, c is 100 is 601.

But wait, earlier when I considered the cases where one variable is zero, I found 6 solutions. Let me check if these are included in the 601.

Yes, because when a=100, b can be 200 and c=0, which is included in the 201 solutions for a=100. Similarly for other cases.

So, does this mean that all 6 solutions where a variable is zero are included in the 601?

Yes, because in each case, when a variable is zero, say c=0, then a=100 and b=200 is a solution, which is counted in the a=100 case, and similarly for other permutations.

Wait, but when c=0, and a=200, b=100, that's another solution, which would be included in the a=200 case, but a=200 isn't 100, so this might not be in the count.

Wait, no, because when a=200, that's not in a=100, b=100, or c=100, so the solution (200,100,0) wouldn't be included in the 601.

Wait, this suggests a problem with the inclusion-exclusion approach because the cases where a variable is zero are not necessarily included in the cases where a, b, or c is 100.

Wait, perhaps the initial assumption that (a-100)(b-100)(c-100)=0 implies that at least one of a, b, c is 100 is correct, but in the case where a variable is zero, we have another solution outside this.

Wait, but earlier, when I assumed c=0, I found that a=100 and b=200 is a solution, meaning that a=100, which is included in the case a=100.

Similarly, a=200, but that's not 100, but in that case, the solution is (200,100,0), which would require that b=100, which is covered in the case where b=100.

Wait, so when c=0, the solution (200,100,0) is included in the case where b=100, since b=100, and a + c=200, but a=200 and c=0.

So, yes, that solution is included in the cases where a, b, or c is 100.

So, the six solutions where one variable is zero are all included in the 601 count.

Wait, but when I considered the case where a=0, I found solutions where b=100 and c=200, which would be included in the case where b=100, as in the solution (0,100,200), which is part of the 201 solutions when b=100.

So, yes, all the six solutions are included in the 601.

But wait, this suggests that the total number of solutions is 601. But that seems high.

Wait, but the problem is that when a=100, we have 201 solutions, which includes all possible (b,c) with b + c=200, including when b or c is 100 or zero.

But wait, let me check the total number of solutions when a=100.

Each of these 201 solutions corresponds to a different triple, with a=100, and varying b and c.

Similarly for b=100 and c=100.

But when we take the union of all three cases, using inclusion-exclusion, we get 3*201 - 3*1 +1=601 solutions.

But let's see if that's correct.

Alternatively, perhaps all the solutions satisfy that at least one of a, b, c is 100. So, the total number of triples is 601.

But let me think again: when I considered a=100, I found that any pair (b,c) with b + c=200 satisfies the second equation. So, all those 201 triples are valid.

Similarly, when b=100, any (a,c) with a + c=200 will satisfy, and same for c=100.

But in this case, some triples are counted multiple times.

For example, the triple (100,100,100) is counted three times: once in a=100, once in b=100, once in c=100.

Similarly, the triple (100,200,0) is counted once in a=100 (as a=100, b=200, c=0), and also in b=200? Wait, no, because when b=100, the other variables are a and c, which sum to 200. So, in that case, (200,100,0) would be when b=100, a=200, c=0.

So, that's another solution, which is included in the b=100 case.

Thus, in the inclusion-exclusion count, each of these 601 solutions is unique, except for the overlaps where two variables are 100, which are counted three times but subtracted twice, leaving them counted once.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating, but according to inclusion-exclusion, the total number of solutions where at least one variable is 100 is 601.

But earlier, when I considered the case where a=100, I found 201 solutions, which includes any b and c that sum to 200, whether they are 100, 0, or any other number.

So, the total number of solutions is 601.

But wait, let me check if that's correct.

Wait, 3*201 =603.

Subtract 3 for the overlaps where two variables are 100: 603 -3=600.

Add back 1 for the triple where all three are 100: 600 +1=601.

Yes, that seems correct.

So, the total number of solutions is 601.

Wait, but earlier, when I considered the case where one variable is zero, I found six solutions. Are these all included in the 601?

Yes, because when c=0, a=100 and b=200 is included in the a=100 case, and a=200, b=100, c=0 is included in the b=100 case, etc.

So, all six solutions are included in the 601.

But wait, what about the triple (100,100,100)? That's included once in the 601, right?

Yes, because it's counted three times in the individual cases but subtracted twice and added back once.

So, the total number of triples is 601.

Wait, but wait a minute. When a=100, b + c=200. The number of non-negative integer solutions is 201, which includes all possible (b,c) from (0,200) up to (200,0).

Similarly for b=100 and c=100. So, the inclusion-exclusion count is correct.

But let me check with a small example to see if the inclusion-exclusion works.

Suppose we have a=100, b=100, c=100.

That's one solution.

Now, when a=100, b can be 200 and c=0, which is another solution. Similarly, when a=100, b=0 and c=200 is another solution.

But in the inclusion-exclusion, these are all counted as part of the a=100, b=100, or c=100 cases.

So, yes, 601 seems correct.

Wait, but when I first saw the problem, I thought the answer was 601, but perhaps I made a miscalculation.

Wait, but let me think: if a=100, then the number of solutions is 201, which includes all possible (b,c) with b + c=200. Similarly for the other cases.

But when a=100, b=100, c=100 is included, as is when a=100, b=200, c=0, etc.

So, the inclusion-exclusion count of 601 seems correct.

Wait, but perhaps I'm making a mistake. Let me check the case when a=100, b=100, c=100.

In this case, all three variables are 100, and it's counted once in the inclusion-exclusion.

Similarly, when a=100, b=200, c=0, that's a valid solution, and it's counted once in the a=100 case.

But when a=200, b=100, c=0, that's another solution, which is counted in the b=100 case.

So, all six solutions where one variable is zero are included in the 601.

So, the total number of solutions is 601.

Wait, but let me think: is there any other solution where none of a, b, c is 100?

Earlier, I thought that the equation (a-100)(b-100)(c-100)=0 implies that at least one variable must be 100. So, all solutions must have at least one variable equal to 100.

But wait, when I considered the case where c=0, I found that a=100, b=200 is a solution, which fits, as a=100.

Similarly, when a=200, but then b=100, which is 100, so that's included.

Wait, but what if all variables are different from 100? Then the equation (a-100)(b-100)(c-100)=0 would imply that none of them are zero, which would be a contradiction.

Thus, there are no solutions where none of a, b, c is 100. So, all solutions must have at least one variable equal to 100.

Therefore, the total number of solutions is indeed 601.

So, the answer is 601.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused because earlier, when I considered a=100, I thought that any (b,c) with b + c=200 is a solution, so 201 solutions for a=100, similarly for b=100 and c=100.

But then, when I combine them, using inclusion-exclusion, I get 601.

But let me check if that's the case with smaller numbers.

Suppose S=200, and the second equation is some value, but for testing.

Wait, perhaps I can test the case.

Wait, let me take a=100, b=100, c=100, which satisfies a + b + c=300 and the second equation.

Another test case: a=100, b=200, c=0. Then a + b + c=300, and the second equation is a²b + a²c + b²a + b²c + c²a + c²b=100²*200 + 100²*0 +200²*100 +200²*0 +0 +0=10,000*200 + 40,000*100=2,000,000 +4,000,000=6,000,000.

So, yes, that works.

Another test case: a=200, b=100, c=0. Similarly, the second equation would be 200²*100 +200²*0 +100²*200 +100²*0 +0 +0=40,000*100 +10,000*200=4,000,000 +2,000,000=6,000,000.

So, that works as well.

Another test case: a=150, b=100, c=50. Let's check the sum: 150 +100 +50=300.

Now, the second equation:

a²b +a²c +b²a +b²c +c²a +c²b.

Compute each term:

a²b=150²*100=22500*100=2,250,000.

a²c=150²*50=22500*50=1,125,000.

b²a=100²*150=10,000*150=1,500,000.

b²c=100²*50=10,000*50=500,000.

c²a=50²*150=2500*150=375,000.

c²b=50²*100=2500*100=250,000.

Now, sum all these:

2,250,000 +1,125,000=3,375,000.

3,375,000 +1,500,000=4,875,000.

4,875,000 +500,000=5,375,000.

5,375,000 +375,000=5,750,000.

5,750,000 +250,000=6,000,000.

So, yes, that works.

But in this case, a=150, which is not 100. But according to our earlier analysis, this solution shouldn't exist because it's not covered under a=100, b=100, or c=100.

Wait, that's a problem. Because according to our earlier conclusion, all solutions must have at least one variable equal to 100, but here's a solution where none are 100.

Wait, that's a contradiction. So, perhaps my earlier conclusion that (a-100)(b-100)(c-100)=0 is incorrect.

Wait, let me redo the earlier steps where I thought that (a-100)(b-100)(c-100)=0.

Wait, let me go back.

We had the equation:

100(ab + bc + ac) - abc =2,000,000.

Which I rewrote as:

abc -100(ab + bc + ac) = -2,000,000.

Then, I tried to factor it as (a -100)(b -100)(c -100), but I think I made a mistake there.

Wait, let me compute (a -100)(b -100)(c -100):

Expand it:

= abc -100ab -100ac -100bc +10,000a +10,000b +10,000c -1,000,000.

But our equation is:

abc -100(ab + bc + ac) = -2,000,000.

So, comparing, we have:

abc -100(ab + bc + ac) +10,000(a + b + c) -1,000,000 =0.

But from earlier, we have:

abc -100(ab + bc + ac) = -2,000,000.

So, substituting this into the expanded form:

-2,000,000 +10,000*(a + b + c) -1,000,000 =0.

Which is:

-3,000,000 +10,000*300= -3,000,000 +3,000,000=0.

So, (a -100)(b -100)(c -100)=0.

Wait, so that's correct. Thus, the equation reduces to (a -100)(b -100)(c -100)=0.

Which implies that at least one of a, b, c must be 100.

But in the test case where a=150, b=100, c=50, we have a solution where b=100, so it's included in the case where b=100.

So, my earlier mistake was in thinking that a=150, b=100, c=50 is a solution where none are 100, but in fact, b=100, so it's included in the case where b=100.

So, the conclusion is correct: all solutions must have at least one variable equal to 100.

Therefore, the total number of solutions is indeed 601.

Wait, but in the test case where a=150, b=100, c=50, that's a valid solution and it is included in the case where b=100.

So, that's correct.

Therefore, the total number of triples is 601.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The number of triples is found by considering cases where at least one variable is 100, leading to a total of 601 solutions.

$\boxed{601}$
