Okay, so I need to find the number of rectangles that can be formed inside a regular dodecagon. Each side of the rectangle has to lie on either a side or a diagonal of the dodecagon. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.

First, a regular dodecagon has 12 sides, all equal in length and with equal angles between them. Since it's regular, it's also convex, so all the vertices are on a circle. That might be helpful.

I remember that in regular polygons, especially those with an even number of sides, it's possible to form rectangles by connecting vertices in specific ways. Rectangles require four points, with opposite sides equal and all angles 90 degrees. But in a regular dodecagon, not every set of four points will form a rectangle. So, how do I figure out which ones do?

Wait, maybe symmetry can help. A dodecagon has 12 sides, so it has rotational symmetry of order 12 and reflectional symmetry across multiple axes. Rectangles would likely correspond to points that are symmetrically opposite in some way.

I think the key is to find pairs of parallel sides. In a regular dodecagon, sides are parallel if they are separated by a certain number of edges. For example, in a hexagon, sides opposite each other are parallel. Similarly, in a dodecagon, sides separated by 6 edges are parallel because 12/2 = 6. But wait, maybe other separations can also result in parallel sides.

Actually, in a regular n-gon, two sides are parallel if the number of edges between them is n/2. So for a dodecagon, n=12, so any sides separated by 6 edges are parallel. But what about diagonals? Diagonals can also be parallel. So, maybe considering all possible pairs of parallel lines (both sides and diagonals) and then seeing how they can form rectangles.

But how do I count all possible rectangles? Maybe I should think about selecting two pairs of parallel lines and then seeing if they intersect to form a rectangle. For a rectangle, you need two pairs of parallel lines, each pair perpendicular to the other. Wait, but in a regular dodecagon, the sides and diagonals can have different angles. So, are all pairs of perpendicular lines present?

Wait, no. The angles between the sides and diagonals may not necessarily be 90 degrees. So, perhaps only certain pairs of lines are perpendicular, which would allow the formation of rectangles.

Alternatively, maybe I can model the dodecagon as being inscribed in a unit circle, with each vertex at an angle of 30 degrees apart (since 360/12=30). Then, each vertex can be represented by a complex number or a point (cos θ, sin θ), where θ is a multiple of 30 degrees.

If I can find four points such that the lines connecting them form right angles, then those four points form a rectangle. Alternatively, maybe I can find two diameters that are perpendicular, and then the intersections of those diameters with the polygon's sides and diagonals.

Wait, but not all diameters will pass through vertices. For a regular dodecagon, there are diameters that connect opposite vertices and others that connect midpoints of opposite sides.

Wait, let me clarify: In a regular dodecagon, each vertex is connected to another vertex directly opposite, 6 edges away. So, connecting these gives a diameter of the circumscribed circle. But there are also diagonals that don't necessarily connect vertices but are still lines that can form sides or sides of rectangles.

Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me shift my approach. Maybe instead of thinking about the sides and diagonals, I can think about the possible rectangles in terms of their vertices. Since a rectangle is determined by two pairs of points that are symmetric across both the horizontal and vertical axes, perhaps?

Alternatively, maybe I should count how many pairs of parallel sides there are and then see how they can form rectangles. But I'm not sure.

Wait, another idea: In a regular polygon, a rectangle can be formed by choosing two pairs of vertices that are symmetric with respect to the center of the polygon. So, for each rectangle, it's determined by two such pairs.

But how do I count them? Maybe I can think in terms of choosing two diameters (lines passing through the center) that are perpendicular to each other, and then seeing how many intersection points with the polygon's edges they have. Each intersection would correspond to a vertex of the rectangle.

Wait, but each diameter can intersect the polygon at two points (if it's a vertex diameter) or at the midpoints of sides (if it's a side diameter). Hmm, so maybe depending on whether the diameter is connecting two vertices or two midpoints, the number of intersection points changes.

Wait, in a regular dodecagon, there are 12 vertices and 12 sides, each with a midpoint. So, each diameter can be of two types: vertex diameters (connecting two opposite vertices) or side midpoints diameters (connecting midpoints of two opposite sides).

So, there are 6 vertex diameters (since 12 vertices, each paired with one opposite) and 6 side midpoint diameters.

Now, for a rectangle, I need two perpendicular diameters. Each diameter can be either a vertex diameter or a side diameter. So, I need to choose two diameters that are perpendicular.

But in a regular dodecagon, are the diameters (vertex or side) at angles that are multiples of 30 degrees. So, the angle between two diameters is a multiple of 30 degrees. For them to be perpendicular, the angle between them must be 90 degrees, which is 3*30 degrees. So, we can find pairs of diameters that are separated by 3 steps (since each step is 30 degrees).

Wait, let me think. The diameters themselves are at angles that are multiples of 30 degrees. So, the angle between two diameters is the difference in their angles. For them to be perpendicular, that difference must be 90 degrees or 270 degrees, which is equivalent to 90 degrees modulo 360.

So, for each diameter, how many other diameters are perpendicular to it? Since each diameter is at a multiple of 30 degrees, the ones that are 90 degrees apart would be 3 steps away (because 3*30=90). So, for each diameter, there are four diameters that are perpendicular: at +90, -90, +270, -270 degrees. Wait, wait, no. Wait, for a given diameter at angle θ, the diameters perpendicular to it would be those at θ + 90 and θ - 90 degrees. So, each diameter has two perpendicular diameters. But wait, in a 12-gon, how many are there?

Wait, let's take a specific example. Suppose we have a diameter at 0 degrees (connecting vertex 1 and vertex 7). The diameters perpendicular to this would be at 90 degrees and 270 degrees. Are there diameters at these angles? Yes. The diameter at 90 degrees connects vertex 3 and vertex 9, and the diameter at 270 degrees connects vertex 11 and vertex 5. So, each diameter has two perpendicular diameters.

But wait, let me count the total number of perpendicular diameter pairs. Each pair is counted twice, once from each diameter's perspective. So, the total number of such pairs would be (number of diameters * number of perpendicular diameters per diameter) / 2.

Wait, no. Let's see: the number of diameter pairs that are perpendicular. Each diameter can pair with two others to form a perpendicular pair. But each such pair is unique. So, total number is (number of diameters * 2) / 2 = number of diameters. Wait, that can't be right. Because if each of the 12 diameters (since 12 sides, so 6 diameters? Wait, no, confusion here.

Wait, earlier I thought there are 6 vertex diameters and 6 side midpoint diameters. So, total 12 diameters. Each of these is a line passing through the center, either connecting two vertices or two midpoints of sides.

So, 12 diameters. Each has two perpendicular diameters. So, each diameter can be paired with two others to form a perpendicular pair. So, the total number of perpendicular diameter pairs would be (12 * 2)/2 = 12. Because each pair is counted twice, once from each diameter's perspective.

Wait, but let me check with specific examples. For the diameter at 0 degrees (connecting vertex 1 and 7), the perpendicular diameters would be at 90 and 270 degrees, which are at 3 and 9 vertices, and 11 and 5 vertices. So, that's two. Similarly, for the diameter at 30 degrees (connecting the midpoint of side 1 and the midpoint of side 7), the perpendicular diameters would be at 120 and 300 degrees, which are midpoints of sides 5 and 11, etc.

Wait, but in this case, each diameter has exactly two perpendicular diameters. So, 12 diameters, each with 2 perpendicular partners, but each pair is counted twice, so total pairs are 12.

Wait, but 12 pairs? Each pair consists of two perpendicular diameters. Hmm. So, for each such pair, how many rectangles do they form?

Wait, each pair of perpendicular diameters will intersect the dodecagon at four points, which can be connected to form a rectangle. But wait, not necessarily. Because the diameters could intersect the polygon at midpoints or vertices, depending on their type.

Wait, let's think. If both diameters are vertex diameters, then they each connect two opposite vertices. Their intersection points with the polygon are four vertices, which form a rectangle. That's clear.

If one diameter is a vertex diameter and the other is a side midpoint diameter, then the vertex diameter connects two vertices, and the side midpoint diameter connects two midpoints. The intersection points would be two vertices and two midpoints. Connecting these four points would form a rectangle, but wait, does that make sense?

Wait, no, because if you connect a vertex to a midpoint, is that a side or a diagonal? Hmm, maybe, but in this case, the four points would consist of two vertices and two midpoints. Let me visualize: if you have a rectangle with two vertices and two midpoints, is that possible?

Wait, for example, suppose we have a vertex at 0 degrees and a midpoint at 15 degrees. Then, the perpendicular diameters would intersect the polygon at these points. But wait, the midpoint at 15 degrees is the midpoint between vertex 12 and vertex 1. Hmm, connecting 0 degrees, 15 degrees, 180 degrees, and 195 degrees might form a rectangle? Not sure. Alternatively, maybe not all such combinations form rectangles.

Wait, maybe this complicates things. Perhaps instead, I should only consider vertex diameters, which connect opposite vertices, and side mid diameters, which connect midpoints of opposite sides. Then, when I pair a vertex diameter with a side mid diameter, the four intersection points are two vertices and two midpoints, which may not form a rectangle because the sides would be between a vertex and a midpoint, which might not be at right angles.

Alternatively, perhaps only pairs of vertex diameters and side mid diameters that are perpendicular would form rectangles.

Wait, maybe I should separate the diameters into two categories: those connecting vertices (vertex diameters) and those connecting midpoints (side mid diameters). Then, the number of rectangles can be calculated based on how these diameters interact.

Let me denote:

- VD: vertex diameters (there are 6, since 12 vertices, each paired with the opposite one)
- SM: side mid diameters (also 6, since 12 sides, each midpoint paired with the opposite)

Each VD is a line connecting two opposite vertices, and each SM connects two opposite midpoints.

Now, for a rectangle, I need two pairs of parallel lines. Each pair of parallel lines can be either two VD lines or two SM lines, but wait, no. Wait, in a regular dodecagon, the sides are all the same, but the diagonals can have different lengths.

Actually, wait, for a rectangle, we need two pairs of parallel lines. So, perhaps the sides of the rectangle lie on either sides or diagonals of the dodecagon. So, another approach: for each possible pair of parallel lines (sides or diagonals), find all possible rectangles that can be formed by choosing two such pairs that are perpendicular.

But this seems complicated. Maybe it's better to think in terms of the diameters and how they form the sides of the rectangle.

Wait, another idea: Each rectangle is determined by choosing two pairs of points that are symmetric across two perpendicular diameters. So, for each rectangle, there's a unique pair of perpendicular diameters (VD and SM, or VD and VD, or SM and SM?), but wait, VD and SM being perpendicular might not always yield a rectangle.

Alternatively, perhaps only VD and SM diameters that are perpendicular can form a rectangle. Let me think. If I have a VD at 0 degrees and an SM at 90 degrees, their intersection points would be at the vertices and midpoints, but would connecting those four points form a rectangle?

Wait, for example, if VD is connecting vertex 1 and 7, and SM is connecting the midpoints of sides 3 and 9. Then, the four points would be vertex 1, midpoint of side 3, vertex 7, midpoint of side 9. Connecting these in order would form a quadrilateral. But is this a rectangle?

Hmm, not necessarily. Because the sides between vertex 1 and midpoint of side 3 would not be perpendicular to the sides between midpoint of side 3 and vertex 7. I think the angles would not be 90 degrees. So, maybe only certain combinations of VD and SM diameters form rectangles.

Alternatively, perhaps only pairs of VD diameters that are perpendicular can form rectangles, and similarly for SM diameters.

Wait, if I take two VD diameters that are perpendicular, meaning their connecting lines are at 90 degrees. For example, VD1 at 0 degrees and VD2 at 90 degrees. These two VD diameters will intersect at the center, and their intersection points with the polygon are four vertices. Connecting these four vertices would form a rectangle.

Similarly, if I take two SM diameters that are perpendicular, then their intersection points are four midpoints, which can form another rectangle.

Additionally, if I take a VD and an SM diameter that are perpendicular, perhaps their intersection points (two vertices and two midpoints) can form another rectangle.

So, perhaps the total number of rectangles would be the sum of:

1. Rectangles formed by two perpendicular VD diameters.
2. Rectangles formed by two perpendicular SM diameters.
3. Rectangles formed by one VD and one SM diameter that are perpendicular.

So, let's calculate each part.

First, how many pairs of perpendicular VD diameters are there?

There are 6 VD diameters, each at 30-degree intervals. Each VD diameter has two others that are perpendicular to it (since 30*3=90). So, for each VD, there are two others that are perpendicular. Thus, the number of pairs is (6 * 2)/2 = 6. Because each pair is counted twice.

Similarly, for SM diameters, there are 6 SM diameters, each also at 30-degree intervals. Each SM diameter has two others that are perpendicular to it. So, the number of pairs is also (6 * 2)/2 = 6.

Now, for the third case: pairs consisting of one VD and one SM diameter that are perpendicular.

Each VD diameter can pair with two SM diameters that are perpendicular to it. Since each VD is at a certain angle, there are two SM diameters at ±90 degrees relative to it.

But wait, let's see: for each VD, how many SM diameters are perpendicular to it? Since VD diameters are at angles 0, 30, 60, ..., 330 degrees, and SM diameters are also at the same angles. Wait, no: wait, VD diameters connect vertices, so their angles are at the vertices' positions, which are every 30 degrees. But SM diameters connect midpoints, which are at 15 degrees offset. So, the SM diameters are at 15, 45, 75, ..., 345 degrees.

Ah, so the angles of VD and SM diameters are offset by 15 degrees. So, the angle between a VD diameter and an SM diameter is 15 degrees. So, can a VD and an SM diameter be perpendicular?

15 degrees difference: multiples of 15 can reach 90. 90 /15 =6. So, each VD diameter is at 0, 30, 60,...330. An SM diameter is at 15, 45, 75,...345.

So, for a VD at 0 degrees, an SM diameter at 90 degrees is at 90, which is 3*30. The SM diameters are at 15,45,75,... So, 90 is not an SM diameter; the closest is 75 and 105. The angle between 0 and 75 is 75, and between 0 and 105 is 105. Neither is 90. So, a VD and an SM diameter cannot be perpendicular because their angular difference is 15, 30,..., but 90 is not a multiple of 15 in the sense that 90 = 6 * 15. Wait, yes, 6 *15=90. So, if a VD is at 0 degrees, then the SM diameters at 0+90=90 degrees is not an SM diameter. Wait, SM diameters are at 15,45,75,105,... So, 90 is not among them.

Wait, 90 degrees is equivalent to 6 steps of 15 degrees. The SM diameters are at every 30 degrees but offset by 15. So, 15,45,75,105,...,345. So, 90 is not in this set. Therefore, there are no SM diameters at 90 degrees. So, actually, a VD and an SM diameter cannot be exactly 90 degrees apart because their angles don't align. So, the angle between a VD and an SM is always a multiple of 15 degrees, but 90 is a multiple of 15 (6*15=90). But since SM diameters are at 15,45,75, etc., 90 is not one of them. So, perhaps there are no pairs of VD and SM diameters that are exactly 90 degrees apart.

Wait, for example, VD at 0 degrees, SM diameters at 75, 85? No, 75 is 75, which is 5*15. 75-0=75, which is not 90. Similarly, VD at 30 degrees, SM diameters at 120 (30+90), but 120 is 8*15, which is 120. But does an SM diameter exist at 120? Yes, because 120 is 8*15. Wait, 15*8=120. So, SM diameters at 120 degrees would be present. So, VD at 30 and SM at 120 are 90 degrees apart.

Wait, yes. So, for a VD at θ, an SM at θ +90 degrees would be perpendicular. But since SM diameters are at θ +15k for k=0 to 11, we can check if θ +90 is congruent to any SM diameter.

Wait, for example, for VD at 0 degrees, θ +90=90. Is 90 a multiple of 30 (since SM diameters are at 15,45,75, etc.)? 90 is 3*30, which is not in the SM diameters' angles (which are 15,45,75, etc.). Wait, 90 is 6*15, but the SM diameters are at 15,45,75,105,135,165,195,225,255,285,315,345. So, 90 is not among them. So, VD at 0 and SM at 90 would not be a valid pair because SM at 90 doesn't exist.

Wait, but SM diameters are at 15,45,75, etc. So, for VD at 30 degrees, θ +90=120. 120 is 8*15, which is present as an SM diameter. Similarly, VD at 60 degrees, θ +90=150, which is 10*15=150, which is an SM diameter.

So, in this case, for each VD diameter, there exists exactly two SM diameters that are perpendicular to it. Let me check:

VD at 0: looking for SM at 90, which isn't present. So, perhaps none.

VD at 30: SM at 120 (30+90=120), which is present.

VD at 60: SM at 150 (60+90=150), present.

VD at 90: SM at 180, which is present (but 180 is a VD diameter, not an SM one. Wait, 180 is a VD diameter, connecting vertices opposite each other. So, SM diameters at 180 would connect midpoints of opposite sides. So, yes, 180 is an SM diameter.

Wait, this is getting complicated. Maybe it's better to think that each VD diameter can pair with two SM diameters that are at θ +90 and θ -90 degrees. But since SM diameters are offset by 15 degrees, maybe some of these are present.

Wait, for each VD at θ, the SM diameters at θ +90 and θ -90 may or may not exist, depending on θ.

But let's consider that for each VD, the number of SM diameters perpendicular to it would be two.

Wait, perhaps each VD can pair with two SM diameters that are perpendicular. But let's think about how many such pairs exist.

Since there are 6 VD diameters, each can pair with 2 SM diameters. So, 6*2=12. But each SM diameter is paired with two VD diameters (since each SM diameter is perpendicular to two VD diameters). So, the total number of such VD-SM pairs is (6*2)/2 =6.

Wait, that makes sense. So, there are 6 pairs where a VD and an SM diameter are perpendicular.

So, summarizing:

1. Number of rectangles from two perpendicular VD diameters: 6
2. Number of rectangles from two perpendicular SM diameters: 6
3. Number of rectangles from one VD and one SM diameter that are perpendicular: 6

So, total rectangles would be 6 +6 +6=18.

But wait, is that correct? Let me think again.

Each pair of perpendicular VD diameters gives a unique rectangle. Similarly for SM diameters. And each pair of VD and SM diameters that are perpendicular also gives a unique rectangle. So, adding them up.

But wait, is that all? Are there other rectangles that aren't accounted for by these pairs?

Wait, perhaps not, because any rectangle must have two pairs of parallel sides. In a dodecagon, the only parallel lines are those separated by 6 edges. So, perhaps all rectangles are accounted for by these pairs.

Wait, but I'm not entirely sure. Let me try to visualize or perhaps count another way.

Another approach is to consider that a rectangle is determined by choosing two distinct pairs of points that are symmetric across two perpendicular axes.

In the dodecagon, the axes are the diameters. So, each rectangle is determined by two perpendicular diameters, each contributing two points. So, each rectangle is uniquely determined by a pair of perpendicular diameters.

But wait, the diameters can be of two types: VD and SM.

So, the total number of pairs of perpendicular diameters is:

- VD and VD: 6 pairs (as calculated earlier)
- SM and SM: 6 pairs
- VD and SM: 6 pairs

So, total of 18 pairs, each forming a unique rectangle.

So, the total number of rectangles is 18.

Wait, but wait a second. When I choose two VD diameters that are perpendicular, they intersect at the center and each contribute two vertices. Connecting these four vertices gives a rectangle.

Similarly, for two SM diameters, they contribute four midpoints, which form a rectangle.

For a VD and an SM diameter that are perpendicular, they contribute two vertices and two midpoints, which form another rectangle.

So, all these 18 possibilities give a unique rectangle.

But wait, is that correct? Let me consider specific examples.

Take VD1 at 0 degrees and VD2 at 90 degrees. They form a rectangle with vertices at 0, 90, 180, 270 degrees. Makes sense.

Take SM1 at 15 degrees and SM2 at 105 degrees (since 15 +90=105). These form a rectangle with midpoints at 15, 105, 195, 285 degrees. That should be a rectangle.

And take VD1 at 30 degrees and SM1 at 120 degrees. Then, the four points are vertex at 30, midpoint at 120, vertex at 210 (30+180), and midpoint at 330 (120+210? Wait, 120+180=300, which isn't 330. Wait, maybe I'm miscalculating.

Wait, if VD is at 30 degrees, the opposite vertex is at 210. SM at 120 degrees connects midpoints at 120 and 300 degrees (since 120+180=300). So, the four points are vertex 30, vertex 210, midpoint 120, midpoint 300. Connecting these in order would form a quadrilateral, but is it a rectangle?

Wait, the sides would be from 30 to 120 (vertex to midpoint), then 120 to 210 (midpoint to vertex), then 210 to 300 (vertex to midpoint), then 300 to 30 (midpoint to vertex). Hmm, does this form a rectangle? Let me check the angles.

The angle between 30-120 and 120-210: is it 90 degrees? Hmm, the line from 30 to 120 is a diagonal, and from 120 to 210 is another diagonal. The angle between them depends on their slopes.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to model the points on a coordinate system. Let me assign coordinates:

Vertex 30: (cos 30°, sin 30°)
Midpoint 120: (cos 120°, sin 120°)
Vertex 210: (cos 210°, sin 210°)
Midpoint 300: (cos 300°, sin 300°)

So, plotting these points:

Vertex 30: (√3/2, 1/2)
Midpoint 120: (-1/2, √3/2)
Vertex 210: (-√3/2, -1/2)
Midpoint 300: (1/2, -√3/2)

Now, connecting these points in order: 30, 120, 210, 300.

Wait, but in reality, a rectangle should have four sides, each at right angles. Let me compute the vectors between these points.

Vector from 30 to 120: (-1/2 - √3/2, √3/2 - 1/2)
Vector from 120 to 210: (-√3/2 - (-1/2), -1/2 - √3/2)
Vector from 210 to 300: (1/2 - (-√3/2), -√3/2 - (-1/2))
Vector from 300 to 30: (√3/2 - 1/2, 1/2 - (-√3/2))

Hmm, calculating these:

First vector: (- (1 + √3)/2, (√3 -1)/2 )
Second vector: (-√3/2 + 1/2, -1/2 - √3/2 )
Third vector: ( (1 + √3)/2, (-√3 +1)/2 )
Fourth vector: (√3/2 -1/2, (1 +√3)/2 )

Wait, are these vectors perpendicular? Let me check the dot product between the first and second vectors.

First vector: (a, b) = (- (1 + √3)/2, (√3 -1)/2 )
Second vector: (c, d) = ( (1 - √3)/2, (-1 - √3)/2 )

Dot product: a*c + b*d
= [ (- (1 + √3)/2 ) * ( (1 - √3)/2 ) ] + [ ( (√3 -1)/2 ) * ( (-1 - √3)/2 ) ]

Calculating each term:

First term:
= [ (-1)(1) + (-1)(-√3) + (-√3)(1) + (-√3)(-√3) ] / 4
= [ -1 + √3 -√3 + 3 ] /4
= (2)/4 = 1/2

Second term:
= [ (√3)(-1) + (√3)(-√3) + (-1)(-1) + (-1)(-√3) ] /4
= [ -√3 -3 +1 +√3 ] /4
= (-2)/4 = -1/2

So, total dot product: 1/2 -1/2=0.

Ah, so the first and second vectors are perpendicular. Similarly, the other vectors would also form right angles because of the symmetry. So, yes, this does form a rectangle.

So, each of these 18 cases (6 VD-VD, 6 SM-SM, 6 VD-SM) gives a unique rectangle. Therefore, the total number of rectangles is 18.

Wait, but I have a feeling that this might not be the complete picture. Because in a regular dodecagon, there are more possibilities for rectangles beyond just these. For example, rectangles that are not aligned with the main diameters but are formed by connecting other vertices or midpoints.

Wait, another idea: The number of rectangles can also be determined by choosing two distinct pairs of parallel sides or diagonals. Each pair of parallel sides can be considered as a direction, and the number of rectangles is the number of ways to choose two such directions that are perpendicular.

So, in a regular dodecagon, how many distinct directions (slopes) are there for sides and diagonals?

Each side has a direction determined by the angle it makes with the horizontal. In a regular dodecagon, the sides are at angles of 0°, 30°, 60°, etc., up to 330°. But for diagonals, they can have angles that are multiples of 15°, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the number of distinct directions is equal to the number of distinct angles between the sides and the center. For a regular n-gon, the number of distinct directions is n, but considering both sides and diagonals, it's more complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps for a regular dodecagon, the number of distinct directions is 12, each corresponding to a vertex or a midpoint.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think again.

Each rectangle is determined by two pairs of parallel lines. Each pair can be a side or a diagonal. So, first, I need to find all possible pairs of parallel lines. Then, among these, find pairs that are perpendicular to each other, and then count the number of rectangles formed by each such pair.

But how many pairs of parallel lines are there in a regular dodecagon?

In a regular polygon, two lines are parallel if they are separated by n/2 steps. For a dodecagon, n=12, so lines separated by 6 steps are parallel.

But in a regular dodecagon, each side is a line segment, but when extended, they form lines. So, each side lies on a line that can be extended infinitely in both directions. Similarly, each diagonal can be extended.

So, the number of distinct parallel directions is equal to the number of distinct angles that these lines can make with the horizontal.

In a regular dodecagon, each vertex is at an angle of 30°, so the sides are at angles of 0°, 30°, 60°, etc. But for diagonals, the angles can be different.

Wait, maybe the number of distinct directions is 12, considering each edge and each diagonal as a separate direction. But no, because some diagonals are parallel to each other or to sides.

Wait, perhaps the number of distinct directions is equal to the number of sides plus the number of diagonals, but considering parallelism.

But perhaps another approach: in a regular n-gon, the number of distinct directions for sides and diagonals is n, because each direction corresponds to a step size k, where k ranges from 1 to floor(n/2). For n=12, k can be 1,2,3,4,5,6.

Each step size k corresponds to a direction. For k=1, it's the side; for k=2, it's a diagonal; up to k=6, which is the diameter.

But for each k, the direction is unique, except when k and n are not coprime, in which case the direction repeats.

Wait, for n=12, k=1: direction unique
k=2: direction unique
k=3: direction unique
k=4: direction unique
k=5: direction unique
k=6: direction unique

But wait, for k=6, it's the diameter, which is the same as k=6 in the other direction. So, actually, for each k from 1 to 5, and k=6.

So, the number of distinct directions is 6 (for k=1 to 6), but each direction has multiple lines.

Wait, no. For a regular n-gon, each step size k (1 ≤ k ≤ n/2) gives a distinct direction. So, for n=12, k=1 to 6, each gives a distinct direction. So, total 6 distinct directions.

But wait, for k=1 and k=11, they give the same direction but in opposite orientations. So, perhaps the number of distinct directions is 6.

But wait, in a regular dodecagon, the sides are in 6 distinct directions, each separated by 30°, but when considering diagonals, perhaps more directions emerge.

Wait, no. Actually, for each k, the direction is determined by the angle. For k=1, the angle is 0°, for k=2, 15°, for k=3, 30°, etc. Wait, maybe I need to think differently.

Wait, perhaps each chord (side or diagonal) can be characterized by the angle it makes with the horizontal axis. For a regular dodecagon, each chord of step size k has an angle of (180*(k-1))/n degrees? Not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps each chord of step size k makes an angle of (180*k)/n degrees with the horizontal. For n=12, that would be (15k) degrees. So, for k=1, 15°, k=2, 30°, k=3, 45°, etc., up to k=6, 90°.

Wait, that might make sense. So, the number of distinct directions is 6, each 15° apart, from 15° to 90°, but for each direction, there are multiple lines with that direction.

Wait, but for each direction, how many lines are there? For example, for k=1, which is 15°, how many lines are there in that direction? In a regular dodecagon, each direction k corresponds to two lines (one in each direction), but maybe in this case, each direction has multiple lines.

Wait, perhaps each direction has multiple lines because for each k, there are multiple chords with that step size. For k=1, there are 12 sides, each in the same direction but offset by the polygon's symmetry.

Wait, no, each side is in a unique direction. Wait, no, for a regular polygon, each side is in the same direction as another side, but rotated.

Wait, perhaps this is getting too tangled. Let me think differently.

Each rectangle is determined by two pairs of parallel lines, each pair in a distinct direction, and the two directions being perpendicular.

So, to count the number of rectangles, I need to count the number of ways to choose two perpendicular directions, and for each such pair, count how many rectangles can be formed.

But how many pairs of perpendicular directions are there in the dodecagon?

In a regular dodecagon, each direction is determined by a step size k, where k=1 to 6. The angle for each direction is 15k degrees. So, the angles are 15°, 30°, 45°, 60°, 75°, and 90°.

Now, which pairs of these angles are perpendicular? Two angles are perpendicular if their difference is 90°, i.e., 6*15°.

Looking at the angles:

15°, 30°, 45°, 60°, 75°, 90°.

Which pairs differ by 90°?

15° and 105° (but 105° isn't in our list)
30° and 120° (120° isn't in our list)
45° and 135° (135° not in list)
60° and 150° (150° not in list)
75° and 165° (165° not in list)
90° and 180° (180° is present, but 180° is the same as 0°, which is another direction).

Wait, none of the pairs of angles in the list differ by exactly 90°, because all the angles are 15°,30°,45°,60°,75°,90°, and adding 90° gives 105°, 120°, etc., which are not in the list. Therefore, there are no two directions among the six that are perpendicular.

But that can't be right because earlier we found that VD and SM diameters can be perpendicular. Hmm.

Wait, maybe the step size approach is not capturing the midpoints. Because when considering midpoints, the step sizes are different.

Alternatively, perhaps the step size approach is only for the vertices, and the midpoints have their own step sizes.

Wait, perhaps the midpoints correspond to step sizes that are half-integers, like k=0.5,1.5, etc. But in a 12-gon, step sizes are integers from 1 to 6.

Alternatively, perhaps midpoints are considered as step size 6.5 or something, but that complicates things.

Wait, perhaps the initial approach of counting based on diameters was correct. So, with that approach, the total number of rectangles is 18.

But I'm a bit uncertain because I feel like there should be more rectangles, especially considering other possible pairs of lines.

Wait, another idea: perhaps the number of rectangles is equal to the number of pairs of perpendicular diameters, which we calculated as 18. But each rectangle is counted once for each pair of diameters that form it.

Wait, no, each rectangle is determined by exactly one pair of perpendicular diameters. So, if there are 18 such pairs, then there are 18 rectangles.

But wait, no, actually, each pair of perpendicular diameters defines exactly one rectangle. So, 18 pairs would mean 18 rectangles.

But earlier, when I considered the VD-VD, SM-SM, and VD-SM cases, I had 6+6+6=18. So, that makes 18 rectangles.

But wait, let me think of another way. For each rectangle, how many pairs of perpendicular diameters determine it? Each rectangle is determined by exactly one pair of perpendicular diameters. So, the number of rectangles equals the number of such pairs, which is 18.

But I'm still a bit unsure because I feel like I might have missed some rectangles.

Wait, perhaps the number is higher. Let me think about smaller regular polygons and see if the method holds.

Take a square (4-gon). How many rectangles? Only 1, the square itself.

Using the method: number of VD diameters: 2, number of SM diameters: 2.

Pairs of VD-VD perpendicular: 1 (since each VD is perpendicular to the other)
Pairs of SM-SM perpendicular: 1
Pairs of VD-SM perpendicular: 0? Because in a square, VD and SM diameters are the same as the sides. Wait, perhaps in a square, midpoints and vertices coincide.

Wait, in a square, the midpoints of the sides are the same as the vertices of a smaller square. Hmm, perhaps the method isn't directly applicable to smaller polygons.

Alternatively, take a regular hexagon (6-gon). How many rectangles can be formed?

In a regular hexagon, rectangles can be formed by selecting two pairs of opposite sides. But the hexagon itself is not a rectangle. Wait, actually, in a regular hexagon, the only rectangles are those formed by selecting two pairs of opposite sides.

Wait, in a regular hexagon, each pair of opposite sides are parallel. So, the number of rectangles would be the number of ways to choose two pairs of opposite sides that are perpendicular.

But in a regular hexagon, each pair of opposite sides are separated by 3 edges, and the angle between adjacent sides is 60°, so two sides are perpendicular if they are separated by 3 steps, but in a hexagon, the opposite sides are 3 apart, but the angle between them is 60°, not 90°.

Wait, in a regular hexagon, the opposite sides are not perpendicular; they are parallel but at 60° to each other.

Wait, so maybe in a regular hexagon, there are no rectangles because no two pairs of opposite sides are perpendicular. But that's not true because you can form rectangles by connecting non-adjacent vertices.

Wait, for example, in a regular hexagon, a rectangle can be formed by connecting every other vertex, forming a regular hexagon's rectangle? No, wait, connecting every other vertex in a regular hexagon gives a equilateral triangle.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Maybe in a regular hexagon, you cannot form any rectangles because all internal angles are 120°, which doesn't allow for right angles.

Wait, perhaps the regular hexagon doesn't have any rectangles, which would make sense because all its sides and angles don't support right angles.

So, going back to the dodecagon, which does have enough symmetry to form rectangles.

So, perhaps the initial method of 18 rectangles is correct.

But another way to think about it: for each rectangle, you need two pairs of points symmetric across two perpendicular axes.

In the dodecagon, the axes are the diameters. So, each rectangle is determined by choosing two perpendicular diameters, and then taking their intersection points with the polygon.

Each such pair of diameters gives exactly one rectangle.

So, the number of rectangles is equal to the number of pairs of perpendicular diameters.

Earlier, we found that there are 6 VD-VD perpendicular pairs, 6 SM-SM perpendicular pairs, and 6 VD-SM perpendicular pairs, totaling 18.

Thus, the number of rectangles is 18.

But wait, another thought: each pair of perpendicular diameters corresponds to a unique rectangle, but perhaps some rectangles are counted multiple times. For example, a rectangle formed by VD1 and SM1 might also be formed by another pair of diameters. But I don't think so because each rectangle has a unique pair of perpendicular diameters that define it.

Therefore, the total number of rectangles is 18.

To determine the number of rectangles that can be formed inside a regular dodecagon (12-gon) where each side of the rectangle lies on either a side or a diagonal of the dodecagon, we analyze the symmetry and structure of the polygon.

A regular dodecagon has 12 sides, and its vertices are equally spaced on a circle. Rectangles are formed by selecting four points such that the lines connecting them are parallel and perpendicular. In the dodecagon, parallel lines are those separated by 6 edges, and perpendicular lines are those separated by 3 edges (since 360°/12 = 30°, and 30°×3 = 90°).

The dodecagon has two types of diameters:
1. **Vertex Diameters (VD):** These connect opposite vertices and are at angles of 0°, 30°, 60°, ..., 330°.
2. **Midpoint Diameters (SM):** These connect midpoints of opposite sides and are at angles of 15°, 45°, 75°, ..., 345°.

To form a rectangle, we need two pairs of perpendicular diameters. These pairs can be:
1. Two perpendicular VD diameters.
2. Two perpendicular SM diameters.
3. One VD diameter and one SM diameter that are perpendicular.

### Counting the Rectangles:
1. **VD-VD Perpendicular Pairs:** There are 6 VD diameters. Each VD diameter has 2 others that are perpendicular to it, but each pair is counted twice. Thus, there are \( \frac{6 \times 2}{2} = 6 \) such pairs.
2. **SM-SM Perpendicular Pairs:** Similarly, there are 6 SM diameters. Each SM diameter has 2 others that are perpendicular to it, leading to \( \frac{6 \times 2}{2} = 6 \) such pairs.
3. **VD-SM Perpendicular Pairs:** Each VD diameter can pair with 2 SM diameters that are perpendicular to it, and vice versa. However, each pair is unique, resulting in \( 6 \) such pairs.

Adding these, the total number of rectangles is:
\[
6 \, (\text{VD-VD}) + 6 \, (\text{SM-SM}) + 6 \, (\text{VD-SM}) = 18
\]

Thus, the number of rectangles that can be formed inside the regular dodecagon is:

\boxed{18}
