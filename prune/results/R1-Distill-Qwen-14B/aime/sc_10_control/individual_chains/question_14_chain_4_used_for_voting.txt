Okay, so I have this problem here where I need to find the greatest four-digit number N. The special property of N is that if you change any one of its digits to 1, the resulting number is divisible by 7. Then, once I find N, I have to divide it by 1000 and find the sum of the quotient Q and the remainder R.

Hmm, let me break this down. First, N is a four-digit number, so it's between 1000 and 9999. I need the largest such N, so I should probably start checking from 9999 downwards until I find one that meets the condition.

The condition is that changing any single digit to 1 makes the number divisible by 7. So for each digit in N, when I replace it with 1, the new number should be divisible by 7. That means I have to check four different numbers for each N: changing the thousands digit to 1, the hundreds digit to 1, the tens digit to 1, and the ones digit to 1. Each of these modified numbers must be divisible by 7.

Let me think about how I can approach this. It might be time-consuming to check every four-digit number from 9999 down, as for each number, I have to check four modified versions. But maybe there are some patterns or properties I can use to narrow down the possibilities.

First, let's consider what happens when each digit is changed to 1. For a four-digit number N = ABCD (where A, B, C, D are its digits), the modified numbers would be:

1. Changing A to 1: 1BCD
2. Changing B to 1: A1CD
3. Changing C to 1: AB1D
4. Changing D to 1: ABC1

Each of these should be divisible by 7.

Since I'm looking for the largest N, I should start with 9999 and check each number. But checking each number one by one might take too long, so perhaps I can find some constraints.

Let me think about the original number N. Since changing each digit to 1 must result in a multiple of 7, each modified number must be 0 mod 7. So, for each digit position, replacing it with 1 gives a number congruent to 0 mod 7.

Let me represent N as 1000A + 100B + 10C + D. Then, the modified numbers are:

1. 1000*1 + 100B + 10C + D = 1000 + 100B + 10C + D
2. 1000A + 100*1 + 10C + D = 1000A + 100 + 10C + D
3. 1000A + 100B + 10*1 + D = 1000A + 100B + 10 + D
4. 1000A + 100B + 10C + 1 = N + 1 - D

Each of these must be divisible by 7. So, for each modified number, (modified number) ≡ 0 mod 7.

Let me denote the original number N as n. Then, the four modified numbers can be expressed as:

1. m1 = n - (A*1000) + 1000
2. m2 = n - (B*100) + 100
3. m3 = n - (C*10) + 10
4. m4 = n - D + 1

Each m_i must be 0 mod 7, so m_i ≡ 0 mod 7.

Which can be rewritten as:

1. (n + (1000 - A*1000)) ≡ 0 mod 7
2. (n + (100 - B*100)) ≡ 0 mod 7
3. (n + (10 - C*10)) ≡ 0 mod 7
4. (n + (1 - D)) ≡ 0 mod 7

Wait, maybe that's a bit convoluted. Alternatively, since each modified number is n with one digit replaced by 1, we can write each modified number as:

- m1 = 1000 + 100B + 10C + D
- m2 = 1000A + 100 + 10C + D
- m3 = 1000A + 100B + 10 + D
- m4 = 1000A + 100B + 10C + 1

Each of these must be ≡0 mod7.

So, for each m_i, m_i ≡0 mod7.

Let me represent this as:

m1 ≡0 mod7 --> 1000 + 100B + 10C + D ≡0 mod7
m2 ≡0 mod7 --> 1000A + 100 + 10C + D ≡0 mod7
m3 ≡0 mod7 --> 1000A + 100B + 10 + D ≡0 mod7
m4 ≡0 mod7 --> 1000A + 100B + 10C + 1 ≡0 mod7

So, I have four congruence relations here. Let me see if I can express these in terms of n.

Wait, the original number n is 1000A + 100B + 10C + D.

So, for m1: m1 = 1BCD in digits, which is 1000 + 100B + 10C + D.

Similarly, m2 is A1CD: 1000A + 100 + 10C + D.

m3 is AB1D: 1000A + 100B + 10 + D.

m4 is ABC1: 1000A + 100B + 10C + 1.

Each of these m_i must be 0 mod7.

So, another approach: since N is the original number, each m_i can be written as N with a certain digit changed. So, for m1, it's N - (A*1000) + 1*1000 = N - 1000A + 1000.

Similarly, m2 = N - 100B + 100, m3 = N - 10C + 10, m4 = N - D + 1.

So, m1 = N + (1000 - 1000A)
m2 = N + (100 - 100B)
m3 = N + (10 - 10C)
m4 = N + (1 - D)

Each of these must be 0 mod7.

So, m1 ≡0 mod7 --> N + (1000 - 1000A) ≡0 mod7
m2 ≡0 mod7 --> N + (100 - 100B) ≡0 mod7
m3 ≡0 mod7 --> N + (10 - 10C) ≡0 mod7
m4 ≡0 mod7 --> N + (1 - D) ≡0 mod7

So, for each, N + (some term) ≡0 mod7.

So, perhaps I can write these as:

N ≡ - (1000 - 1000A) mod7
N ≡ - (100 - 100B) mod7
N ≡ - (10 - 10C) mod7
N ≡ - (1 - D) mod7

Which can be simplified.

But 1000 mod7: let's compute 1000/7. 7*142=994, so 1000 ≡6 mod7. Similarly, 100 ≡2 mod7 (since 7*14=98, 100-98=2), 10 ≡3 mod7, 1≡1 mod7.

So, substituting:

1. N ≡ - (6 - (1000 mod7)*A ) mod7
Wait, perhaps better to compute each coefficient mod7.

Wait, let me re-express each term.

First, m1: 1000 - 1000A mod7.

1000 ≡6 mod7, so 1000A ≡6A mod7.

Thus, 1000 -1000A ≡6 -6A mod7.

So, equation 1: N ≡ -(6 -6A) mod7 --> N ≡ (-6 +6A) mod7.

Similarly, m2: 100 -100B mod7. 100≡2, so 100B ≡2B mod7. Thus, 100 -100B ≡2 -2B mod7.

Equation 2: N ≡ -(2 - 2B) mod7 --> N ≡ (-2 +2B) mod7.

m3: 10 -10C mod7. 10≡3, so 10C≡3C mod7. Thus, 10-10C ≡3 -3C mod7.

Equation 3: N ≡ -(3 -3C) mod7 --> N ≡ (-3 +3C) mod7.

m4: 1 - D mod7, so equation 4: N ≡ -(1 - D) mod7 --> N ≡ (-1 + D) mod7.

So now, I have four congruence equations:

1. N ≡ (-6 +6A) mod7
2. N ≡ (-2 +2B) mod7
3. N ≡ (-3 +3C) mod7
4. N ≡ (-1 + D) mod7

But since N is a fixed number, all these congruences must be equal. So, N mod7 must be equal to each of the right-hand sides.

Thus, for each digit A, B, C, D, we have:

(-6 +6A) ≡ (-2 +2B) ≡ (-3 +3C) ≡ (-1 + D) mod7.

So, all four expressions must be congruent mod7.

This gives us a set of equations:

-6 +6A ≡ -2 +2B mod7
-6 +6A ≡ -3 +3C mod7
-6 +6A ≡ -1 + D mod7

Let me simplify these.

First equation:

-6 +6A ≡ -2 +2B mod7
=> 6A -2B ≡ (-2) - (-6) mod7
=> 6A -2B ≡4 mod7
We can divide both sides by 2 because 2 and 7 are coprime:
3A - B ≡2 mod7.

Second equation:

-6 +6A ≡ -3 +3C mod7
=>6A -3C ≡ (-3) - (-6) mod7
=>6A -3C ≡3 mod7
Divide both sides by 3:
2A - C ≡1 mod7.

Third equation:

-6 +6A ≡ -1 + D mod7
=>6A - D ≡ (-1) - (-6) mod7
=>6A - D ≡5 mod7.

So now, we have three equations:

1. 3A - B ≡2 mod7
2. 2A - C ≡1 mod7
3. 6A - D ≡5 mod7

These relate the digits A, B, C, D.

Additionally, since N is a four-digit number, A is from 1 to9, and B, C, D are from 0 to9.

Our goal is to find the largest N, which is 9999, so we can iterate from 9999 downwards, but perhaps using these equations can help us find N more efficiently.

So, let me consider that A is as large as possible, which is 9. Let's see if A=9 is possible.

If A=9, let's compute the required residues.

From equation 1: 3*9 - B ≡2 mod7. 27 mod7 is 6, since 7*3=21, 27-21=6.

So, 6 - B ≡2 mod7 --> -B ≡2 -6 mod7 --> -B ≡-4 mod7 --> B ≡4 mod7.

So, B can be 4 or 11, but since B is a digit, B=4 or 11 is invalid, so B=4.

From equation 2: 2*9 - C ≡1 mod7. 18 mod7 is 4, because 7*2=14, 18-14=4.

So, 4 - C ≡1 mod7 --> -C ≡1 -4 mod7 --> -C ≡-3 mod7 --> C≡3 mod7.

So C can be 3 or 10, but since it's a digit, C=3.

From equation 3:6*9 - D ≡5 mod7. 54 mod7: 7*7=49, 54-49=5, so 54≡5 mod7.

So, 5 - D ≡5 mod7 --> -D ≡0 mod7 --> D≡0 mod7.

So D must be 0 or7.

Since we want the largest N, which is 9999, but with A=9, B=4, C=3, D=0 or7.

Wait, so the digits would be A=9, B=4, C=3, D=0 or7.

So N is either 9430 or 9437.

But we're looking for the largest N, so between these two, 9437 is larger.

But wait, hold on. Let me check if these digits actually satisfy the conditions.

Wait, but wait, when A=9, B=4, C=3, D=0 or7.

So N could be 9430 or 9437.

But let's verify whether changing each digit to 1 gives a number divisible by7.

First, take N=9437.

Check m1: change A to1: 1437. Is 1437 divisible by7?

1437 ÷7: 7*205=1435, so 1437-1435=2. Remainder 2. Not divisible by7. So, m1 is not 0 mod7. So, N=9437 doesn't satisfy the condition.

Wait, that's a problem. So, perhaps I made a mistake in the equations.

Wait, because when I changed A=9 to1, I got 1437, which is not divisible by7. So, N=9437 is invalid.

So, does that mean that A=9 is not possible? Because when I set A=9, B=4, C=3, D=0 or7, neither 9430 nor 9437 satisfy m1 being divisible by7.

Wait, perhaps I did something wrong in the earlier steps.

Wait, let me double-check the equations.

We had:

1. 3A - B ≡2 mod7
2. 2A - C ≡1 mod7
3. 6A - D ≡5 mod7

For A=9:

Equation1: 3*9 - B ≡2 mod7 --> 27 - B ≡2 mod7. 27 mod7 is 6, so 6 - B ≡2 mod7 --> -B ≡-4 mod7 --> B≡4 mod7. So, B=4 or 11, but B is a digit, so B=4. That seems correct.

Equation2: 2*9 - C ≡1 mod7 --> 18 - C ≡1 mod7. 18 mod7 is 4, so 4 - C ≡1 mod7 --> -C ≡-3 mod7 --> C≡3 mod7. So, C=3 or 10, but C is a digit, so C=3. Correct.

Equation3:6*9 - D ≡5 mod7. 54 mod7 is 5, so 5 - D ≡5 mod7 --> -D ≡0 mod7 --> D≡0 mod7. So D=0 or7. Correct.

So, N=9430: let's check m1. Change A to1: 1430. 1430 ÷7: 7*204=1428, 1430-1428=2. Remainder 2. Not divisible by7. So m1 is not 0. So N=9430 is invalid.

Similarly, N=9437: m1=1437, which we already saw is not divisible by7.

Hmm, so maybe my approach is missing something. Perhaps I need to not only satisfy the congruences but also ensure that each modified number is actually divisible by7.

Wait, but the congruence equations were derived to ensure that each modified number is 0 mod7. So, why is it not working?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in setting up the equations.

Wait, let me re-express m1:

m1 is 1BCD = 1000 + 100B +10C + D.

From N = 1000A + 100B +10C + D.

So m1 = N - (A*1000) + 1000.

So, m1 = N -1000A +1000.

Thus, m1 ≡0 mod7 --> N -1000A +1000 ≡0 mod7.

Similarly, 1000A ≡ (1000 mod7)*A ≡6A mod7.

So, N -6A +6 ≡0 mod7.

Thus, N ≡6A -6 mod7.

Wait, but earlier I had N ≡ (-6 +6A) mod7, which is the same as 6A -6 mod7.

Wait, maybe I should represent it differently. Let me re-express all four congruences correctly.

Wait, perhaps I confused the equations earlier.

Let me re-express each modified number in terms of N.

m1 = 1BCD = 1000 + 100B +10C + D = (N - A*1000) + 1000.

So, m1 = N -1000*(A-1).

Similarly, m2 = N -100*(B) +100.

m3 = N -10*(C) +10.

m4 = N - D +1.

So, each m_i is N minus the digit times its place plus the new digit (1) times its place.

But this might complicate things. Alternatively, perhaps it's better to compute each m_i in terms of N and the digit changes.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute each m_i modulo7.

Given that N ≡k mod7, then m1 must be ≡0 mod7. So, m1 = N - (A*1000) +1000. So, m1 ≡k - (A*1000 mod7) + (1000 mod7) mod7.

Which is k - (6A) +6 mod7.

So, for m1 ≡0: k -6A +6 ≡0 mod7 --> k ≡6A -6 mod7.

Similarly, m2 = N - (B*100) +100. So, m2 ≡k - (2B) +2 mod7.

Set to 0: k -2B +2 ≡0 mod7 --> k ≡2B -2 mod7.

m3 = N - (C*10) +10. So, m3 ≡k -3C +3 mod7. Set to0: k ≡3C -3 mod7.

m4 = N - D +1. So, m4 ≡k - D +1 mod7. Set to0: k ≡ D -1 mod7.

So, now, we have:

k ≡6A -6 mod7 (from m1)
k ≡2B -2 mod7 (from m2)
k ≡3C -3 mod7 (from m3)
k ≡D -1 mod7 (from m4)

So, all four expressions must equal k mod7.

Thus, we can set them equal to each other:

6A -6 ≡2B -2 mod7,
6A -6 ≡3C -3 mod7,
6A -6 ≡D -1 mod7.

So, let's write these equations:

1. 6A -6 ≡2B -2 mod7
2. 6A -6 ≡3C -3 mod7
3. 6A -6 ≡D -1 mod7

Simplify each equation:

Equation1:

6A -6 -2B +2 ≡0 mod7
6A -2B -4 ≡0 mod7
Divide both sides by 2:
3A - B -2 ≡0 mod7
So, 3A - B ≡2 mod7.

Equation2:

6A -6 -3C +3 ≡0 mod7
6A -3C -3 ≡0 mod7
Divide both sides by3:
2A - C -1 ≡0 mod7
So, 2A - C ≡1 mod7.

Equation3:

6A -6 - D +1 ≡0 mod7
6A - D -5 ≡0 mod7
So, 6A - D ≡5 mod7.

So these are the same equations as before. So, that part was correct.

So, with A=9, we have:

Equation1: 3*9 - B ≡2 mod7 --> 27 - B ≡2 mod7. 27 mod7 is 6, so 6 - B ≡2 --> -B ≡-4 mod7 --> B=4.

Equation2: 2*9 - C ≡1 mod7 --> 18 - C ≡1 mod7. 18 mod7 is4, so 4 - C ≡1 --> -C ≡-3 mod7 --> C=3.

Equation3:6*9 - D ≡5 mod7 -->54 -D ≡5 mod7. 54 mod7 is5, so 5 - D ≡5 --> -D ≡0 mod7 --> D=0 or7.

So, D=0 or7.

So, N would be 9430 or9437.

But when we check m1 for N=9430:

Change A to1: 1430. 1430 ÷7: 7*204=1428, 1430-1428=2. So, 1430≡2 mod7. Not 0. Thus, m1 is not divisible by7. So, N=9430 is invalid.

Similarly, N=9437: m1=1437. 1437 ÷7: 7*205=1435, 1437-1435=2. So, 1437≡2 mod7. Not 0. So, N=9437 is invalid.

Hmm, so perhaps A=9 is invalid because when we set A=9, the equations give N with m1 not divisible by7. So maybe A=9 is impossible. So, let's try A=8.

So, A=8.

Equation1:3*8 -B ≡2 mod7 -->24 - B ≡2 mod7.

24 mod7: 7*3=21, 24-21=3. So, 3 - B ≡2 mod7 --> -B ≡-1 mod7 --> B≡1 mod7. So, B=1 or 8.

Equation2:2*8 -C ≡1 mod7 -->16 - C ≡1 mod7.

16 mod7 is2, so 2 - C ≡1 mod7 --> -C ≡-1 mod7 --> C≡1 mod7. So, C=1 or8.

Equation3:6*8 - D ≡5 mod7 -->48 - D ≡5 mod7.

48 mod7: 7*6=42, 48-42=6. So, 6 - D ≡5 mod7 --> -D ≡-1 mod7 --> D≡1 mod7. So, D=1 or8.

So, possible digits:

A=8, B=1 or8, C=1 or8, D=1 or8.

We want the largest N, so we want the largest possible digits.

So, let's set B=8 (since it's larger than1), C=8, D=8.

So, N=8888.

Wait, but let's check if this satisfies the conditions.

Check each modified number:

m1: Change A to1: 1888. Is this divisible by7? Let's compute 1888 ÷7.

7*269=1883, 1888-1883=5. So, remainder 5. Not divisible by7. So, m1 is invalid.

So, N=8888 is invalid. So, perhaps I need to try other combinations.

Wait, perhaps I should choose the largest possible digits for B, C, D, but perhaps not all 8's.

Wait, let's think: is there another combination where B, C, D=8 but perhaps A=8 but other digits being 8? Or maybe reduce some digits.

Alternatively, perhaps we can set B=1, C=1, D=1, but that would give a smaller N.

Wait, but let's see. Let's set B=8, C=8, D=8, and check N=8888, which didn't work.

Alternatively, perhaps try N=8818.

Wait, but maybe a different approach. Since A=8, B can be1 or8, same with C and D.

Let me try B=8, C=1, D=8.

So, N=8 8 1 8 = 8818.

Check m1: 1818. 1818 ÷7: 7*259=1813, 1818-1813=5. Not divisible by7.

Hmm, not good. Maybe m1 is problematic.

Alternatively, perhaps set B=8, C=8, D=1.

N=8881.

m1: 1881. 1881 ÷7: 7*268=1876, 1881-1876=5. Again, remainder5.

Not good. Alternatively, maybe D=8, but that didn't work.

Wait, perhaps N=8188.

Check m1: 1188. 1188 ÷7: 7*169=1183, 1188-1183=5. Again, same issue.

Hmm, maybe I'm stuck here. Perhaps A=8 is also invalid for m1.

Wait, perhaps I should try A=7.

Let me try A=7.

Equation1:3*7 - B ≡2 mod7 -->21 - B ≡2 mod7. 21 mod7 is0, so 0 - B ≡2 mod7 --> -B≡2 mod7 --> B≡5 mod7.

So, B=5 or12, but since it's a digit, B=5.

Equation2:2*7 - C ≡1 mod7 -->14 - C ≡1 mod7. 14 mod7 is0, so 0 - C ≡1 mod7 --> -C≡1 mod7 --> C≡6 mod7.

So, C=6 or13, but C is a digit, so C=6.

Equation3:6*7 - D ≡5 mod7 -->42 - D ≡5 mod7. 42 mod7 is0, so 0 - D ≡5 mod7 --> -D≡5 mod7 --> D≡2 mod7.

So, D=2 or9.

So, possible N digits: A=7, B=5, C=6, D=2 or9.

So, N can be 7562 or7569.

Let's check which one is larger: 7569 is larger.

Check m1: Change A to1:1569. Check if 1569 ÷7 is integer.

7*224=1568, 1569-1568=1. Remainder1. Not divisible by7.

Hmm, invalid.

Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake. Let me check N=7569.

m1:1569 →1569 mod7: 7*224=1568 →1569≡1 mod7. Not 0.

So, N=7569 is invalid.

Wait, maybe I need to choose D=2 instead.

N=7562.

Check m1:1562. 1562 ÷7: 7*223=1561, 1562-1561=1. Again, remainder1. Not divisible by7.

Hmm, that's not good. So, N=7562 is also invalid.

Wait, so perhaps A=7 is invalid. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe I should try another approach. Let me consider that each modified number must be divisible by7, so all four modified numbers must be 0 mod7.

If I can write expressions for each m_i in terms of N, maybe I can find a relationship between the digits.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to look for N such that when any digit is changed to1, the number becomes divisible by7. So, perhaps N itself has some property.

Wait, let me think about the original number N. Since changing any digit to1 results in a multiple of7, perhaps N is close to a multiple of7, but not exactly. Because when you change a digit, you're making it a multiple of7.

Alternatively, perhaps N is such that N is ≡ something mod7, and the modified numbers are 0 mod7.

Wait, perhaps I can find N modulo7 such that when I change any digit to1, the modified number is 0 mod7.

Let me consider that.

Let me denote N as n. Then, for each digit position, changing the digit to1, the modified number is n with that digit changed. So, for each position, the modified number is n - (digit * place) +1*place. So, the modified number is n - (digit -1)*place.

Thus, for each position, modified number = n - (d_i -1)*p_i, where p_i is the place value (1000,100,10,1).

So, the modified number is congruent to n - (d_i -1)*p_i ≡0 mod7.

So, n - (d_i -1)*p_i ≡0 mod7 for each digit position i.

Which can be rewritten as:

n ≡ (d_i -1)*p_i mod7 for each i.

So, for each digit position, n ≡ (d_i -1)*p_i mod7.

Wait, but n is fixed, so all these congruences must be equal. So, (d_i -1)*p_i ≡ same value mod7 for each i.

Hmm, perhaps this can be used.

Let me compute p_i mod7:

1000 mod7: 1000 ÷7=142*7=994, 1000-994=6 →1000≡6 mod7.

100 mod7: 100 ÷7=14*7=98, 100-98=2 →100≡2 mod7.

10 mod7=3.

1 mod7=1.

So, the place values mod7 are 6,2,3,1.

So, for each digit position, we have:

n ≡ (d_i -1) * p_i mod7, where p_i are 6,2,3,1.

Thus, for the four digits, we have:

1. n ≡ (A-1)*6 mod7
2. n ≡ (B-1)*2 mod7
3. n ≡ (C-1)*3 mod7
4. n ≡ (D-1)*1 mod7

So, all four expressions must be equal to n mod7.

Thus, we can set them equal to each other:

(A-1)*6 ≡ (B-1)*2 ≡ (C-1)*3 ≡ (D-1)*1 mod7.

Let me denote n mod7 as k. So, all four expressions equal to k.

So,

(A-1)*6 ≡k mod7 →6(A-1) ≡k mod7.

(B-1)*2 ≡k mod7 →2(B-1) ≡k mod7.

(C-1)*3 ≡k mod7 →3(C-1) ≡k mod7.

(D-1)*1 ≡k mod7 →D-1 ≡k mod7.

So, from the last equation, D = (k +1) mod7.

So, D is determined by k.

Similarly, from the third equation: 3(C-1) ≡k mod7 → C-1 ≡ (k * 3^{-1}) mod7.

Since 3*5=15≡1 mod7, so inverse of3 mod7 is5.

Thus, C-1 ≡5k mod7 → C ≡ (5k +1) mod7.

From the second equation: 2(B-1) ≡k mod7 → B-1 ≡ (k * 2^{-1}) mod7.

Since 2*4=8≡1 mod7, inverse of2 is4.

Thus, B-1 ≡4k mod7 → B ≡ (4k +1) mod7.

From the first equation:6(A-1) ≡k mod7.

But 6 ≡-1 mod7, so - (A-1) ≡k mod7 → A-1 ≡-k mod7 → A ≡( -k +1 ) mod7.

So, A ≡ (1 -k) mod7.

So, now we have expressions for each digit in terms of k.

But each digit must be between0 and9 (except A, which must be 1-9).

So, let's find possible k values (0-6) and see what digits they produce.

We need to find k such that when we compute A,B,C,D from k, they are valid digits.

Let me tabulate for each k from0 to6:

k | A=(1 -k) mod7 | B=(4k +1) mod7 | C=(5k +1) mod7 | D=(k +1) mod7

Let me compute each:

For k=0:

A=(1-0)=1 mod7 →A=1

B=(0+1)=1 mod7 →B=1

C=(0+1)=1 mod7 →C=1

D=(0+1)=1 mod7 →D=1

So, N=1111.

But 1111 is a four-digit number, but likely not the maximum.

k=1:

A=1-1=0 mod7 →A=0 (invalid, since A must be ≥1)

So, k=1 is invalid.

k=2:

A=1-2= -1 ≡6 mod7 →A=6

B=4*2+1=9 mod7 →9 mod7=2 →B=2

C=5*2+1=11 mod7=4 →C=4

D=2+1=3 mod7 →D=3

So, N=6 2 4 3 =6243.

Check if changing each digit to1 makes it divisible by7.

Change A to1:1243 →1243 ÷7: 7*177=1239, 1243-1239=4 → not divisible by7.

So, invalid.

k=3:

A=1-3= -2≡5 mod7 →A=5

B=4*3+1=13 mod7=6 →B=6

C=5*3+1=16 mod7=2 →C=2

D=3+1=4 mod7 →D=4

So, N=5 6 2 4=5624.

Check m1:1624. 1624 ÷7: 7*232=1624 → yes, divisible by7.

m2:5124. 5124 ÷7: 7*732=5124 → yes.

m3:5614. 5614 ÷7: 7*802=5614 → yes.

m4:5621. 5621 ÷7: 7*803=5621 → yes. So, N=5624 is valid.

But I'm looking for the largest N, so maybe there's a larger k that gives a valid N.

k=4:

A=1-4=-3≡4 mod7 →A=4

B=4*4+1=17 mod7=3 →B=3

C=5*4+1=21 mod7=0 →C=0

D=4+1=5 mod7 →D=5

So, N=4 3 0 5=4305.

Check m1:1305. 1305 ÷7: 7*186=1302, 1305-1302=3 → not divisible by7. So, invalid.

k=5:

A=1-5=-4≡3 mod7 →A=3

B=4*5+1=21 mod7=0 →B=0

C=5*5+1=26 mod7=5 →C=5

D=5+1=6 mod7 →D=6

So, N=3 0 5 6=3056.

Check m1:1056. 1056 ÷7: 7*150=1050, 1056-1050=6 → not divisible by7. Invalid.

k=6:

A=1-6=-5≡2 mod7 →A=2

B=4*6+1=25 mod7=4 →B=4

C=5*6+1=31 mod7=3 →C=3

D=6+1=7 mod7=0 →D=0

So, N=2 4 3 0=2430.

Check m1:1430 →1430 ÷7: 7*204=1428, 1430-1428=2 → remainder 2. Not divisible by7. Invalid.

So, among k=0 to6, only k=0 and k=3 give valid N, with N=1111 and N=5624.

But 5624 is larger than 1111, but perhaps there's a larger N beyond that.

Wait, but I think I might have missed some possibilities because when I set k=0, I get N=1111, but perhaps for other k values, when digits wrap around.

Wait, perhaps I can consider that each digit is in the range0-9, so even if the computed digit is less than0, I can add7 to make it positive.

Wait, for example, when k=1, A=(1-1)=0 mod7, but A=0 is invalid. So, maybe A can be 7, which is 0+7=7.

So, A=7.

Wait, let me try that. Let me re-examine k=1.

k=1:

A=1-1=0 mod7. So, possible A=7 (since 0+7=7).

B=4*1+1=5 mod7 →B=5.

C=5*1+1=6 mod7 →C=6.

D=1+1=2 mod7 →D=2.

So, N=7562.

Wait, but earlier when I tried A=7, I had N=7562, which didn't satisfy m1. Let me check again.

m1:1562 ÷7: 7*223=1561, 1562-1561=1. So, remainder1. Not divisible by7.

Hmm, so invalid.

Wait, but maybe I made a mistake in the calculations. Let me check again.

Wait, wait, from the earlier approach, when k=3, we had N=5624, which worked. Let me see if there's a higher k beyond 6, but since mod7, k can only be0-6. So, I think that's all.

So, the largest N found so far is5624. But wait, earlier I thought that when A=9, the N=9430 or9437 didn't work, but perhaps I should check other possibilities.

Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in considering only k=0 to6. Perhaps it's possible to have k beyond that, but since it's mod7, it's cyclic.

Wait, perhaps I should try all possible k and see which gives the largest N.

Wait, let me check the earlier calculation again for k=3: N=5624.

Wait, but perhaps there's a larger N with a higher A.

Wait, but earlier when I tried A=9, I couldn't find a valid N. So, maybe 5624 is the maximum N.

Wait, but let me think again. Maybe I can find a higher N by considering that each digit's condition must be satisfied.

Alternatively, perhaps the maximum N is6231 or something similar.

Alternatively, perhaps I should approach this differently.

Since each modified number must be divisible by7, perhaps I can find N by ensuring that N is such that when any digit is changed to1, the number is divisible by7. So, perhaps N has to be congruent to 1 in some way mod7, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps I can think about N as follows:

For each digit position, changing it to1 must make the number divisible by7. So, for each position, the modified number is divisible by7, which gives us a set of conditions on N.

Wait, another approach: Let me consider that each modified number is equal to7 times some integer. So, for each digit position, m_i =7 * k_i, where k_i is an integer.

So, for m1=1BCD=7k1,

m2=A1CD=7k2,

m3=AB1D=7k3,

m4=ABC1=7k4.

So, each m_i is a multiple of7.

So, perhaps I can set up the equations as:

1. 1000 + 100B +10C + D =7k1

2. 1000A +100 +10C + D =7k2

3. 1000A +100B +10 + D =7k3

4. 1000A +100B +10C +1 =7k4

And N=1000A +100B +10C + D.

So, perhaps I can subtract N from each m_i to find relations.

For m1: m1 = N - (A*1000) +1000 → m1 = N -1000A +1000.

So, N -1000A +1000 =7k1.

Similarly, m2 = N -100B +100 =7k2.

m3= N -10C +10=7k3.

m4= N - D +1=7k4.

So, from each equation, we can express N as:

N=7k1 +1000A -1000

N=7k2 +100B -100

N=7k3 +10C -10

N=7k4 +D -1

Since all equal to N, we can set them equal to each other:

7k1 +1000A -1000 =7k2 +100B -100

7k1 +1000A -1000 =7k3 +10C -10

7k1 +1000A -1000 =7k4 +D -1

But this seems complicated. Perhaps another approach.

Alternatively, perhaps I can take the differences between the modified numbers.

For example, m2 -m1 = (A1CD) - (1BCD) = (A*1000 -1*1000) + (other terms cancel).

So, m2 -m1 = (A -1)*1000.

Similarly, since both m2 and m1 are divisible by7, their difference must also be divisible by7.

So, (A -1)*1000 ≡0 mod7.

But 1000≡6 mod7, so (A-1)*6 ≡0 mod7.

So, 6(A-1) ≡0 mod7.

Since 6 and7 are coprime, this implies that (A-1)≡0 mod7.

So, A-1≡0 mod7 →A≡1 mod7.

So, A can be1 or8, since A is a digit from1-9.

So, A=1 or8.

Similarly, let's compute m3 -m2: (AB1D) - (A1CD) = (B -1)*100.

So, (B -1)*100 ≡0 mod7.

100≡2 mod7, so 2*(B-1)≡0 mod7.

Thus, 2(B-1)≡0 mod7 → B-1≡0 mod7 →B≡1 mod7.

So, B=1 or8.

Similarly, m4 -m3: (ABC1) - (AB1D) = (C -1)*10.

So, 10*(C-1) ≡0 mod7.

10≡3 mod7, so 3*(C-1)≡0 mod7.

Thus, C-1≡0 mod7 →C≡1 mod7.

So, C=1 or8.

Finally, m1 -m4: (1BCD) - (ABC1) = (1 -A)*1000 + (B -0)*100 + (C -0)*10 + (D -1).

But this seems more complicated, perhaps another way.

Wait, since we've established that A=1 or8, B=1 or8, C=1 or8, D can be determined.

But wait, perhaps I can use these findings to narrow down the possibilities.

So, A=1 or8, B=1 or8, C=1 or8.

So, let's consider possible combinations.

Case1: A=8, B=8, C=8.

Then, D must satisfy the condition from m4: m4=ABC1=8881.

Which must be divisible by7.

Check 8881 ÷7: 7*1268=8876, 8881-8876=5 → remainder5. Not divisible by7.

So, invalid.

Case2: A=8, B=8, C=1.

Then, m3=AB1D=881D.

Which must be divisible by7.

But m3=881D.

Similarly, m4=ABC1=8811.

Wait, let me compute m4=8811 ÷7: 7*1258=8806, 8811-8806=5. Not divisible.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps this approach is too time-consuming.

Wait, but earlier we found that when k=3, N=5624, which worked. So, maybe that's the answer.

But let me check another possibility where A=8, B=1, C=1.

So, A=8, B=1, C=1.

Then, D must satisfy m4=ABC1=8111.

Check 8111 ÷7: 7*1158=8106, 8111-8106=5. Not divisible by7.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps A=8, B=1, C=8.

m3=AB1D=818D.

Which must be divisible by7.

But I'm getting stuck here. Maybe I should stick with N=5624.

Wait, but earlier when I tried A=9, B=4, C=3, D=0 or7, but the modified numbers weren't divisible by7. So, perhaps N=5624 is the maximum.

Wait, but let me check N=5624.

Check m1:1624 →1624 ÷7=232 → yes, divisible.

m2:5124 →5124 ÷7=732 → yes.

m3:5614 →5614 ÷7=802 → yes.

m4:5621 →5621 ÷7=803 → yes.

So, N=5624 seems valid.

But wait, is there a larger N that satisfies the conditions?

Wait, let me check N=5624. The next possible N would be higher than this, but perhaps with A=5, B=6, C=2, D=4.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe I can try to find a higher N by considering higher A values.

Wait, perhaps I should try A=7, B=5, C=6, D=2 as earlier.

N=7562.

Check m1:1562 →1562 ÷7=223.142… → remainder1. Not divisible.

So, invalid.

Alternatively, maybe A=6, B=2, C=4, D=3.

N=6243.

Check m1:1243 ÷7=177.571… → remainder4. Not divisible.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps N=6231.

Wait, let me compute m1:1231 →1231 ÷7=175.857… → remainder6. Not divisible.

Not good.

Alternatively, maybe N=6231 is invalid.

Wait, perhaps I should accept that N=5624 is the maximum.

So, N=5624. Then, when divided by1000, Q=5, R=624. So, Q+R=5+624=629.

Wait, but earlier I thought the answer was 629, but I'm not entirely sure if N=5624 is the maximum.

Wait, perhaps I should try another approach.

Let me consider that the four modified numbers must all be divisible by7. So, perhaps N must be such that changing any digit to1 makes it a multiple of7.

So, perhaps N is 7 less than a multiple of7 when a certain digit is changed. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps I can consider that for each digit, the modified number is 0 mod7, so N must satisfy certain congruence relations.

Wait, perhaps I can write four equations based on the modified numbers:

1. 1000 + 100B +10C + D ≡0 mod7

2. 1000A +100 +10C + D ≡0 mod7

3. 1000A +100B +10 + D ≡0 mod7

4. 1000A +100B +10C +1 ≡0 mod7

From these, I can subtract equations to eliminate variables.

For example, subtract equation1 from equation2:

(1000A +100 +10C + D) - (1000 +100B +10C + D) =0 mod7

Simplify:

1000A -1000 +100 -100B =0 mod7

Factor:

1000(A-1) +100(1 - B) =0 mod7

We know 1000≡6 mod7, 100≡2 mod7.

So,

6(A-1) +2(1 - B) ≡0 mod7

Which simplifies to:

6A -6 +2 -2B ≡0 mod7 →6A -2B -4 ≡0 mod7.

Which can be written as:

3A - B ≡2 mod7.

Which matches one of our earlier equations.

Similarly, subtract equation2 from equation3:

(1000A +100B +10 + D) - (1000A +100 +10C + D) =0 mod7

Simplify:

100B -100 +10 -10C =0 mod7

Which is:

100(B-1) +10(1 - C) ≡0 mod7.

100≡2, 10≡3 mod7.

So,

2(B-1) +3(1 - C) ≡0 mod7.

Which is:

2B -2 +3 -3C ≡0 mod7 →2B -3C +1 ≡0 mod7.

Hmm, not sure if that helps.

Alternatively, subtract equation3 from equation4:

(1000A +100B +10C +1) - (1000A +100B +10 + D) =0 mod7

Simplify:

10C -10 +1 - D ≡0 mod7.

Which is:

10(C -1) + (1 - D) ≡0 mod7.

10≡3 mod7.

So,

3(C -1) + (1 - D) ≡0 mod7.

Which is:

3C -3 +1 - D ≡0 mod7 →3C - D -2 ≡0 mod7.

Which can be written as:

3C - D ≡2 mod7.

Hmm.

Alternatively, subtract equation1 from equation4:

(1000A +100B +10C +1) - (1000 +100B +10C + D) =0 mod7

Simplify:

1000A -1000 +1 - D ≡0 mod7.

Which is:

1000(A -1) + (1 - D) ≡0 mod7.

1000≡6 mod7.

So,

6(A-1) + (1 - D) ≡0 mod7.

Which is:

6A -6 +1 - D ≡0 mod7 →6A - D -5 ≡0 mod7.

Which is another equation we had earlier.

So, perhaps this isn't helping much. Maybe I should go back to the earlier solution where N=5624 is the maximum.

Thus, Q=5, R=624. So, Q+R=5+624=629.

Wait, but earlier when I thought about k=3, I got N=5624, which worked. So, perhaps that's the answer.

But I'm a bit unsure because I thought there might be a larger N, but maybe 5624 is the maximum.

Wait, just to be thorough, let me check N=5624.

m1:1624 →1624 ÷7=232. So, yes.

m2:5124 →5124 ÷7=732. So, yes.

m3:5614 →5614 ÷7=802. So, yes.

m4:5621 →5621 ÷7=803. So, yes.

All modified numbers are divisible by7. So, N=5624 is valid.

Is there a larger N? Let me check N=5625.

But wait, let me compute N=5624.

Wait, perhaps I can try N=5624 +7=5631. Let's see if this works.

Change A to1:1631. 1631 ÷7=233, since 7*233=1631. So, yes.

Change B to1:5131. 5131 ÷7=733, since 7*733=5131. Yes.

Change C to1:5611. 5611 ÷7=801.571… → remainder 5611-7*801=5611-5607=4. Not divisible by7.

So, N=5631 is invalid.

Hmm. So, 5624 is valid, but 5631 is not.

So, perhaps 5624 is the maximum.

Thus, Q=5, R=624. So, Q+R=5+624=629.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To solve the problem, we need to find the greatest four-digit number \( N \) such that changing any one of its digits to 1 results in a number divisible by 7. We then find \( Q + R \) where \( Q \) is the quotient and \( R \) is the remainder when \( N \) is divided by 1000.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Understanding the Condition**:
   - For any digit in \( N \), changing it to 1 must result in a number divisible by 7. This gives us four modified numbers:
     - Changing the thousands digit: \( 1BCD \)
     - Changing the hundreds digit: \( A1CD \)
     - Changing the tens digit: \( AB1D \)
     - Changing the ones digit: \( ABC1 \)

2. **Modulo 7 Analysis**:
   - Each modified number must be congruent to 0 modulo 7.
   - Using modulo 7 properties, we derive relationships between the digits of \( N \).

3. **Deriving Congruences**:
   - We express each modified number in terms of \( N \) and find that:
     - \( 3A - B \equiv 2 \mod 7 \)
     - \( 2A - C \equiv 1 \mod 7 \)
     - \( 6A - D \equiv 5 \mod 7 \)
   - These congruences help us determine the possible values of digits \( A, B, C, D \).

4. **Testing Possible Values**:
   - By testing possible values of \( A \) (from 9 downwards), we find that \( A = 5 \) leads to valid digits:
     - \( A = 5 \)
     - \( B = 6 \)
     - \( C = 2 \)
     - \( D = 4 \)
   - Thus, \( N = 5624 \).

5. **Verification**:
   - Check each modified number:
     - \( 1624 \div 7 = 232 \) (divisible)
     - \( 5124 \div 7 = 732 \) (divisible)
     - \( 5614 \div 7 = 802 \) (divisible)
     - \( 5621 \div 7 = 803 \) (divisible)
   - All modified numbers are divisible by 7, confirming \( N = 5624 \) is valid.

6. **Calculating \( Q + R \)**:
   - \( N = 5624 \)
   - \( Q = 5 \) (quotient when divided by 1000)
   - \( R = 624 \) (remainder when divided by 1000)
   - \( Q + R = 5 + 624 = 629 \)

### Final Answer:
\boxed{629}
