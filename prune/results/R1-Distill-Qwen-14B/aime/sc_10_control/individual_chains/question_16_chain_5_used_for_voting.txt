Okay, so I have this math problem here. It says: Let p be the least prime number for which there exists a positive integer n such that n⁴ + 1 is divisible by p². Then, I need to find the least positive integer m such that m⁴ + 1 is divisible by p². Hmm, okay, let me try to break this down.

First, I need to find the smallest prime p where n⁴ + 1 is divisible by p squared. Then, once I have that p, I have to find the smallest m where m⁴ + 1 is divisible by p².

Let me recall some number theory. If p is a prime and p² divides n⁴ + 1, then n⁴ ≡ -1 mod p². That implies that n⁸ ≡ 1 mod p², because if I square both sides, (n⁴)² ≡ (-1)² mod p², which is 1 mod p². So the order of n modulo p² divides 8, but wait, since n⁴ ≡ -1 mod p², the order can't be 4 because -1 squared is 1, which would make the order 8. So the multiplicative order of n mod p² must be 8. That means that 8 divides the order of the multiplicative group mod p², which is φ(p²) = p(p-1). So 8 divides p(p-1). Since p is prime, either 8 divides (p-1) or p=2. But p=2: let me check if p=2 works.

If p=2, then p²=4. So we need n⁴ +1 ≡0 mod 4. Let's see, n can be 1: 1 +1=2 ≡ 2 mod4, not 0. n=2: 16+1=17≡1 mod4. n=3: 81+1=82≡2 mod4. So no n satisfies n⁴ +1 ≡0 mod4. So p=2 doesn't work.

Therefore, p must be an odd prime where 8 divides (p-1). So p ≡1 mod8. So the possible primes are 17, 97, etc. But wait, 17 is the smallest prime where p=1 mod8? Wait, 17 is 1 mod16, but actually, 17 is 1 mod16, but I need primes where p ≡1 mod8. The primes in order are 17, 41, 73, 97, etc. Wait, is 17 the smallest prime that is 1 mod8? Let's see: 17 is 1 mod8, yes. Next is 41, which is 1 mod8, 73 is 1 mod8, etc. So probably 17 is the smallest.

But wait, let me think again. Wait, 17 is the first prime after 2, which is 1 mod8. But maybe there's a smaller prime than 17 that satisfies 8 divides (p-1). Let me list primes: 2,3,5,7,11,13,17. So 17 is the first prime where p-1 is divisible by 8. 17-1=16, which is 2^4, so 8 divides 16. So yes, p=17 is the smallest such prime.

Wait, but I should check if p=17 indeed has a solution n such that n⁴ ≡ -1 mod17²=289. Let me verify that.

So, first, in mod17, n⁴ ≡-1 mod17. Let's see if this is solvable. The multiplicative group mod17 is cyclic of order 16. So, the equation x⁴ ≡ -1 mod17 would have solutions if the order of -1 divides 16/(4). Wait, maybe another approach: in a cyclic group of order 16, the equation x⁴ = -1 would be possible if -1 is a fourth power. Since the group is cyclic, the fourth powers are the elements of order dividing 16/ gcd(4,16)=4. So, the fourth powers are the elements of order dividing 4. So, -1 has order 2, which divides 4, so yes, -1 is a fourth power. So, solutions exist.

Let me find such an n mod17. Let's see, 3^4=81≡81-4*17=81-68=13≡-4 mod17. Not quite.

Wait, 5^4: 5^2=25≡8 mod17, 5^4=8^2=64≡13≡-4 mod17. Hmm, same as 3.

Wait, 2^4=16≡-1 mod17. Oh, right, n=2: 2^4=16≡-1 mod17. So 2 is a solution.

So, in mod17, n=2 is a solution. Now, can we lift this solution to mod17²=289 using Hensel's lemma?

Hensel's lemma says that if f(n)=n⁴ +1, and f(n)≡0 mod p, and f’(n) not ≡0 mod p, then there is a unique lift mod p².

So f(n)=n⁴ +1. f’(n)=4n³.

At n=2 mod17, f’(2)=4*(8) mod17. 4*8=32≡15 mod17. 15 is not 0 mod17, so Hensel applies, meaning there is a unique lift of the root 2 mod17 to mod17².

Therefore, there exists an integer m ≡2 mod17 such that m⁴ +1≡0 mod289.

So, p=17 is the least prime for which such an n exists. Therefore, p=17.

Now, the second part: find the least positive integer m such that m⁴ +1 is divisible by p²=289.

So, I need to find the smallest m such that m⁴ ≡-1 mod289.

Given that Hensel's lemma gives a lift, I can compute m=2 +17k, where k is an integer. Let me compute m⁴ +1 mod289 and find k such that this is 0.

So, let m=2 +17k. Let me compute m⁴.

But calculating (2 +17k)^4 is a bit tedious, so maybe we can compute it mod289.

Alternatively, let me compute m mod17 first. m≡2 mod17, so m=2+17k.

Let me compute m^4 mod17².

Using the binomial theorem: (2 +17k)^4 = 2^4 + 4*(2^3)*(17k) + 6*(2^2)*(17k)^2 + 4*(2)*(17k)^3 + (17k)^4.

But mod289, the terms with (17k)^2 and higher powers will be multiples of 289, so they vanish mod289. So,

m^4 ≡ 2^4 + 4*(8)*(17k) mod289.

Compute each term:

2^4 =16.

4*8=32, so 32*17k= 544k.

So, m^4 ≡16 +544k mod289.

But 544 divided by 289: 289*1=289, 544-289=255. 255 is 289-34? Wait, 289*1=289, 289*2=578 which is larger than 544. So 544=289*1 +255.

Wait, but 544 mod289: 289*1=289, 544-289=255. So 544k mod289 is 255k mod289.

So, m^4 ≡16 +255k mod289.

We need m^4 +1 ≡0 mod289, so 16 +1 +255k ≡0 mod289.

So, 17 +255k ≡0 mod289.

So, 255k ≡ -17 mod289.

Let me compute 255 mod289: 255 is less than 289, so it's 255.

So, 255k ≡-17 mod289.

We can write this as 255k ≡272 mod289 (since -17=272 mod289).

We need to solve for k: 255k ≡272 mod289.

To solve this congruence, we can find the inverse of 255 mod289.

But first, let's see if 255 and 289 are coprime. 289 is 17². 255=15*17=3*5*17. So, gcd(255,289)=17.

But 17 divides 272 (since 272=16*17). So, the equation 255k ≡272 mod289 is equivalent to (255/17)k ≡272/17 mod289/17.

So, 255/17=15, 272/17=16, 289/17=17.

So, the equation reduces to: 15k ≡16 mod17.

Now, solve 15k ≡16 mod17.

15 mod17 is 15, so to find k, we can find the inverse of 15 mod17.

15 and17 are coprime. The inverse of 15 mod17 is a number x such that 15x≡1 mod17.

Trying x=8: 15*8=120. 120 mod17: 17*7=119, so 120≡1 mod17. Yes, so inverse is 8.

So, k≡16*8 mod17.

16*8=128. 128 mod17: 17*7=119, 128-119=9. So, k≡9 mod17.

Therefore, k=9 +17t, where t is an integer.

Therefore, m=2 +17k=2 +17*(9 +17t)=2 +153 +289t=155 +289t.

So, the smallest positive integer m is 155.

But wait, let me confirm that m=155 is indeed the smallest.

Alternatively, perhaps I can compute m=2 +17k, where k=9 is the smallest k that satisfies the condition. So, m=2 +17*9=2+153=155.

But let me check if m=155 is the minimal solution.

Wait, perhaps I should check if there's a smaller m, but since 289 is 17², and m must be ≡2 mod17, the next possible m would be 2, 19, 36, 53, 70, 87, 104, 121, 138, 155, etc. So, m=155 is the first m≡2 mod17 such that m⁴≡-1 mod289.

But let's check if m=155 is indeed the minimal. Alternatively, perhaps I made a miscalculation.

Wait, let me compute m=155 mod289. 155 is less than 289, so it's a candidate.

But let me compute 155⁴ mod289 to confirm.

Alternatively, compute 155 mod17: 155/17=9*17=153, so 155≡2 mod17, which matches the earlier condition.

But computing 155⁴ is a bit tedious, but perhaps I can compute step by step.

First, compute 155 mod289 is 155.

Compute 155²: 155*155.

Let me compute 150²=22500, 2*150*5=1500, 5²=25. So, (150+5)^2=22500+1500+25=24025.

Now, 24025 divided by289: Let's see, 289*83=289*(80+3)=23120 +867=23987.

24025-23987=38. So, 155²≡38 mod289.

Now, compute (155²)^2=38²=1444. Now, 1444 mod289.

Compute 289*4=1156. 1444-1156=288. 288 mod289 is 288. So, 155⁴≡288 mod289.

But 288≡-1 mod289. So, yes, 155⁴≡-1 mod289. So, m=155 works.

Is there a smaller m? Let's check m=155-289= -134. But since m must be positive, 155 is the smallest positive integer.

Wait, but let me see if any m less than155 satisfies m⁴≡-1 mod289. Since m≡2 mod17, the candidates are 2,19,36,53,70,87,104,121,138,155.

Let me check m=2: 2⁴=16≡16 mod289≠-1.

m=19: 19 mod17=2, so m=19 is also a candidate. Let's compute 19⁴ mod289.

19²=361. 361 mod289=361-289=72. So, 19²≡72 mod289.

Then, 72²=5184. Now, 5184 mod289: Let's compute how many times 289 goes into 5184.

289*17=4913. 5184-4913=271. So, 72²≡271 mod289. But 271≡-18 mod289. So, 19⁴≡-18 mod289≠-1. So, no.

Next m=36. Let's compute 36⁴ mod289.

36 mod17=2. So, m=36 is also ≡2 mod17. Let's compute 36²=1296. 1296 mod289: 289*4=1156, 1296-1156=140. So, 36²≡140 mod289.

Then, 140²=19600. 19600 mod289: Let's see, 289*67=289*(60+7)=17340 +2023=19363. 19600-19363=237. So, 140²≡237 mod289. So, 36⁴≡237 mod289≡237≠-1. So, no.

Next, m=53. 53 mod17=53-3*17=53-51=2. So, m=53 is ≡2 mod17.

Compute 53²=2809. 2809 mod289: 289*9=2601. 2809-2601=208. So, 53²≡208 mod289.

Then, 208²=43264. 43264 mod289: Let's divide 43264 by289.

289*149=289*(150-1)=289*150=43350, minus 289=43350-289=43061.

43264-43061=203. So, 208²≡203 mod289. So, 53⁴≡203≠-1. So, no.

Next, m=70: 70 mod17=70-4*17=70-68=2. So, m=70.

70²=4900. 4900 mod289: 289*16=4624. 4900-4624=276. So, 70²≡276 mod289.

276²=76176. 76176 mod289: Let's compute 289*263=289*(260+3)=289*260=75140, 289*3=867. So, 75140+867=76007. 76176-76007=169. So, 276²≡169 mod289. So, 70⁴≡169≠-1. So, no.

Next, m=87: 87 mod17=87-5*17=87-85=2. So, m=87.

87²=7569. 7569 mod289: 289*26=7514. 7569-7514=55. So, 87²≡55 mod289.

55²=3025. 3025 mod289: 289*10=2890, 3025-2890=135. So, 55²≡135 mod289. So, 87⁴≡135≠-1. So, no.

Next, m=104: 104 mod17=104-6*17=104-102=2. So, m=104.

104²=10816. 10816 mod289: 289*37=289*(30+7)=8670+2023=10693. 10816-10693=123. So, 104²≡123 mod289.

123²=15129. 15129 mod289: 289*52=289*(50+2)=14450 +578=15028. 15129-15028=101. So, 123²≡101 mod289. So, 104⁴≡101≠-1. No.

Next, m=121: 121 mod17=121-7*17=121-119=2. So, m=121.

121²=14641. 14641 mod289: Let's compute 289*50=14450. 14641-14450=191. So, 121²≡191 mod289.

191²=36481. 36481 mod289: Let's compute how many times 289 fits into 36481.

289*126=289*(100+20+6)=28900+5780+1734=28900+5780=34680 +1734=36414.

36481-36414=67. So, 191²≡67 mod289. So, 121⁴≡67≠-1. So, no.

Next, m=138: 138 mod17=138-8*17=138-136=2. So, m=138.

138²=19044. 19044 mod289: 289*65=18785. 19044-18785=259. So, 138²≡259 mod289.

259²=67081. 67081 mod289: Let me compute 289*232=289*(200+32)=57800 +9248=67048. 67081-67048=33. So, 259²≡33 mod289. So, 138⁴≡33≠-1. No.

Next, m=155: As before, we have m=155, and 155⁴≡-1 mod289. So, that's the solution.

So, the minimal m is 155. Therefore, the answer is 155.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To solve the problem, we first identify the smallest prime \( p \) such that there exists a positive integer \( n \) with \( n^4 + 1 \) divisible by \( p^2 \). 

### Step 1: Identifying the Prime \( p \)
We need \( n^4 \equiv -1 \pmod{p^2} \). This implies \( n^8 \equiv 1 \pmod{p^2} \), so the order of \( n \) modulo \( p^2 \) must divide 8. Since \( n^4 \equiv -1 \pmod{p^2} \), the order is exactly 8. Thus, 8 must divide \( \phi(p^2) = p(p-1) \). Therefore, \( p \equiv 1 \pmod{8} \).

The smallest prime \( p \) satisfying this is \( p = 17 \). We verify that \( n = 2 \) satisfies \( 2^4 \equiv -1 \pmod{17} \). Using Hensel's lemma, we confirm that there exists a lift of this solution modulo \( 17^2 = 289 \).

### Step 2: Finding the Minimal \( m \)
We solve \( m^4 \equiv -1 \pmod{289} \). Let \( m = 2 + 17k \). Expanding \( m^4 \) modulo 289, we find:
\[
m^4 \equiv 16 + 255k \pmod{289}.
\]
Setting \( m^4 + 1 \equiv 0 \pmod{289} \) gives:
\[
17 + 255k \equiv 0 \pmod{289}.
\]
Simplifying, we solve \( 255k \equiv -17 \pmod{289} \). Using the inverse of 15 modulo 17, we find \( k \equiv 9 \pmod{17} \). Thus, \( k = 9 + 17t \), and the minimal \( m \) is \( 2 + 17 \times 9 = 155 \).

### Final Answer
The least positive integer \( m \) such that \( m^4 + 1 \) is divisible by \( 17^2 \) is \( \boxed{155} \).
