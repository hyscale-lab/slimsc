Okay, so I have this problem about counting the number of paths on an 8x8 grid. The paths are of length 16, which makes sense because in an 8x8 grid, moving from the lower left to the upper right requires 8 right moves and 8 up moves, totaling 16 steps. The catch is that these paths must change direction exactly four times. Hmm, okay, I need to figure out how to count these paths.

First, let me make sure I understand what it means to change direction. In grid paths, you can only move right or up. So, each time you switch from moving right to moving up or vice versa, that's a direction change. For example, if I start by moving right, then up, then right again, that's two direction changes.

Now, the paths are from the lower left to the upper right, so they start at (0,0) and end at (8,8). Each path is a sequence of right (R) and up (U) moves. The total number of steps is 16, with 8 R's and 8 U's. Without any restrictions, the number of paths is the combination of 16 steps taken 8 at a time, which is C(16,8). But here, we need paths that change direction exactly four times.

Wait, how do the number of direction changes relate to the number of runs of consecutive R's or U's? I think each time the direction changes, a new run starts. So, if a path changes direction four times, it must have five runs. For example, starting with R, then U, then R, then U, then R would be three direction changes and four runs. Wait, no, let me think again. Starting direction is R, then to U is one change, then to R is two, then to U is three, and then to R is four changes, leading to five runs. So, yes, each direction change adds a new run.

So, the number of runs is equal to the number of direction changes plus one. So, if we have four direction changes, we have five runs. These runs alternate between R and U. So, depending on whether the path starts with R or U, the runs will alternate accordingly.

Now, since the grid is 8x8, and we have to reach (8,8), each path must have exactly 8 R's and 8 U's, but distributed across the runs.

So, if we have five runs, they must alternate between R and U. So, the path could start with R and then have R, U, R, U, R; or start with U and have U, R, U, R, U. Wait, but since the starting point is (0,0) and the ending is (8,8), which is symmetric, maybe both starting with R and starting with U will contribute similarly. Hmm, but we have to consider both cases.

Wait, no, maybe not. It depends on how the runs are arranged. Let me think: if the path starts with R, then the runs will alternate R, U, R, U, R. That's five runs: R, U, R, U, R. Similarly, if it starts with U, it'll be U, R, U, R, U. So, in either case, the number of runs is five, with three runs of one direction and two runs of the other. Wait, let me count: starting with R, the runs are R, U, R, U, R, which is three R runs and two U runs. Similarly, starting with U, it's three U runs and two R runs.

Since we're starting at (0,0) and ending at (8,8), the number of R's and U's must both be 8. So, for the case where starting with R and having three R runs and two U runs, the total R's must be 8, spread over three runs, each run being at least 1. Similarly, the U's are spread over two runs, each at least 1.

Wait, in stars and bars terms, the number of ways to distribute 8 R's into three runs is C(8-1,3-1) = C(7,2). Similarly, the number of ways to distribute 8 U's into two runs is C(8-1,2-1) = C(7,1). So, for starting with R, the number of such paths is C(7,2)*C(7,1). Similarly, for starting with U, the number of such paths is C(7,2)*C(7,1), because distributing 8 U's into three runs (if starting with U, we have three U runs and two R runs). Wait, no, wait. Let me clarify.

Wait, if we start with R, the runs are R, U, R, U, R. So, the R runs are three in number, each run length at least 1. So, the number of ways to split 8 R's into three runs is C(8-1,3-1) = C(7,2). Similarly, the U runs are two in number, so splitting 8 U's into two runs is C(8-1,2-1) = C(7,1). So, starting with R gives C(7,2)*C(7,1) paths.

Similarly, if we start with U, the runs are U, R, U, R, U. So, the U runs are three, each at least 1, so C(7,2), and the R runs are two, each at least 1, so C(7,1). So, starting with U also gives C(7,2)*C(7,1) paths.

Therefore, total number of paths with exactly four direction changes is 2 * [C(7,2) * C(7,1)]. Let me compute that.

C(7,2) is 21, and C(7,1) is 7. So, 21 * 7 = 147, and then 147 * 2 = 294.

Wait, that seems straightforward, but let me check if I missed anything.

Wait, the direction changes occur between runs. So, for starting with R, the number of direction changes is 4, which would come from the transitions between R and U runs. Let's see: R run, then U, then R, then U, then R. So, four transitions, hence four direction changes. That's correct.

Similarly, starting with U, we have U, R, U, R, U, which is four direction changes. So, that's correct.

So, the rest is about counting the number of ways to split the R's and U's into their respective runs.

Wait, another way to think about it: for each starting direction, the number of such paths is the number of compositions of 8 into 3 parts for R's and 2 parts for U's (or vice versa). The number of compositions is C(n-1,k-1) for each. So, for starting with R, it's C(7,2) for R's and C(7,1) for U's. Multiply them, then double it because starting with R or U is symmetric.

So, the total number is 2 * [C(7,2) * C(7,1)] = 2 * 21 * 7 = 294.

Wait, that seems correct, but let me think again. Is there another way to get the same result?

Alternatively, the number of paths with exactly four direction changes is equal to the number of ways to have five runs. Each run alternates direction. So, the number of runs is five, which must start with either R or U.

Each path that starts with R will have three R runs and two U runs, as we discussed, and vice versa. So, for each starting direction, the number of paths is the product of the ways to split the 8 steps of each direction into the required number of runs.

So, number of R runs: 3, number of U runs:2 if starting with R.

Number of ways to split R's: C(8-1,3-1) = C(7,2) =21.

Number of ways to split U's: C(8-1,2-1)=C(7,1)=7.

Multiply: 21*7=147.

Similarly, starting with U: number of U runs=3, R runs=2.

Number of ways to split U's: C(7,2)=21.

Number of ways to split R's: C(7,1)=7.

Multiply:21*7=147.

Total:147+147=294.

Yes, that seems consistent.

Alternatively, could I model this as a sequence of runs? For each starting direction, the number of compositions is as above. So, I think 294 is the correct answer.

Wait, but let me think of a smaller grid to see if the logic holds. Say, a 2x2 grid, and paths that change direction exactly once. So, total steps:4 (2 R, 2 U). Number of direction changes:1. So, runs would be three? Because direction changes once, so runs=2.

Wait, no: if direction changes once, you have two runs. For example, RRUU is one direction change (from R to U). Or UURR, same thing. Or RURU, but that has three direction changes. Wait, no, in 2x2 grid, let's see.

Wait, a 2x2 grid: from (0,0) to (2,2). Let's count the number of paths that change direction exactly once.

Possible paths:

- RRUU: changes direction once (after two R's).

- UURR: changes direction once (after two U's).

- RUUR: changes direction twice (R to U, then U to R).

Wait, so in a 2x2 grid, the number of paths with exactly one direction change is 2.

Using the formula above: starting with R, number of runs:2. So, R runs:1, U runs:1.

Number of ways to split R's: C(2-1,1-1)=C(1,0)=1.

Similarly for U's: C(1,0)=1.

So, starting with R:1*1=1.

Starting with U: same, 1*1=1.

Total:2, which matches manual count. So formula works here.

Another test: 3x3 grid, paths with exactly two direction changes. So, runs:3.

Starting with R: R, U, R. So, two R runs, one U run.

Number of ways: split R's into two runs: C(3-1, 2-1)=C(2,1)=2.

Split U's into one run: C(3-1,1-1)=C(2,0)=1.

So, starting with R:2*1=2.

Starting with U: similarly, split U's into two runs: C(2,1)=2. Split R's into one run: C(2,0)=1. So, 2*1=2.

Total:4.

Let me count them manually.

Possible paths:

1. RRUUURR: No, wait, 3x3 grid, total steps are 6: 3 R and 3 U.

Wait, no: 3x3 grid requires 3 R and 3 U steps, so 6 total steps.

Wait, two direction changes, so three runs.

Starting with R:

Possible runs: R, U, R.

The number of R's must sum to 3, split into two runs: possible splits are (1,2) and (2,1). Similarly, U split into one run: only (3).

So, R can be [1,2] or [2,1], and U is [3].

So, the actual paths would be:

1. R R U U U R R â†’ but that's 1 R, 3 U, 2 R: but total R is 3, U is 3.

Wait, not sure if that's the way. Wait, perhaps it's better to think of the compositions.

Wait, for starting with R:

First R run can be length 1 or 2, then U run length 3, then R run length 2 or 1 respectively.

So for R run 1: R UUU R R.

Which is R, UUU, R, R.

Wait, but that's R, U, R, R. Wait, no, the U run is length 3, then R run is length 2.

Wait, in terms of the actual path:

R R U U U R R would be R R U U U R R: that's 2 R, 3 U, 2 R: total R=4, which is more than 3. Wait, that can't be.

Wait, maybe I'm confused. Let's think again.

Wait, for starting with R, and three runs: R, U, R.

Total R's:3, so first R run is a, second R run is b, with a + b =3, a>=1, b>=1.

Similarly, U's: c=3, with c >=1.

So, possible a and b: (1,2) and (2,1).

So, the two paths starting with R would be:

1. R U U U R R (a=1, c=3, b=2)

2. R R R U U U (a=2, c=3, b=1)

Wait, no, because after the first R run (a=1), we have a U run (c=3), then the R run (b=2). So, the path is R UUU R R.

But that's R, UUU, R, R: but that would be R U U U R R, which is 1 R, 3 U, 2 R: total R=3, U=3.

Similarly, a=2, c=3, b=1: R R U U U R.

Wait, that's 2 R, 3 U, 1 R: R R U U U R, which is correct.

So, two paths starting with R.

Similarly, starting with U:

U, R, U.

U's: split into two runs: a and b, with a + b=3, a>=1, b>=1.

Possible (1,2), (2,1).

So, the two paths would be:

1. U R R R U U

Wait, no, starting with U: U, R, U.

So, first U run is a, then R run is c=3, then U run is b.

Wait, no, the R run is 3, so:

1. U U U R R R: but that's only two runs, U and R, so direction change once. Wait, wait, no, starting with U, runs U, R, U.

So, first U run: a, then R run: c=3, then U run: b.

So, a + b=3, with a>=1, b>=1.

So, possible a=1, b=2: U U R R R U U.

Wait, but that would be a=2 U's? Wait, no, starting with U, first U run is a=1, then R run is 3, then U run is b=2.

So, the path is U R R R U U.

Wait, let me count the steps: U R R R U U. That's 1 U, 3 R, 2 U. So, U, R, U: correct.

Similarly, a=2, b=1: U U R R R U. So, 2 U, 3 R, 1 U.

So, two paths starting with U.

Therefore, total four paths with exactly two direction changes in a 3x3 grid.

Which matches the calculation: 2 starting with R, 2 starting with U, total 4.

So, formula works here.

Another test: 1x1 grid, from (0,0) to (1,1). Number of paths with 0 direction changes: only two paths, RR UU and UU RR, but wait, no, in 1x1 grid, you have two paths: right then up, or up then right. Each has one direction change. So, number of direction changes is 1, not 0. Wait, that's an edge case.

Wait, but for the formula, if we set n=1, then the number of runs would be direction changes +1.

Wait, maybe the formula isn't applicable for grids smaller than 2x2, but in our original problem, it's 8x8, which is fine.

So, going back, the formula seems correct.

So, for the original problem, the number is 2 * [C(7,2) * C(7,1)] = 2 * 21 *7=294.

Thus, the answer should be 294.

To solve the problem of counting the number of paths from the lower left corner to the upper right corner of an 8Ã—8 grid that change direction exactly four times, we consider the following:

1. **Understanding Direction Changes**: Each time a path switches from moving right (R) to up (U) or vice versa, it constitutes a direction change. A path with exactly four direction changes will have five runs of consecutive moves (e.g., R, U, R, U, R).

2. **Runs and Direction Changes**: If a path starts with R, the runs will alternate as R, U, R, U, R, resulting in three R runs and two U runs. Similarly, if it starts with U, the runs will alternate as U, R, U, R, U, resulting in three U runs and two R runs. In both cases, the total number of R and U moves must sum to 8 each.

3. **Counting the Paths**:
   - **Starting with R**: The number of ways to split 8 R moves into 3 runs is given by the combination \( C(7, 2) \), and the number of ways to split 8 U moves into 2 runs is \( C(7, 1) \). Thus, the number of paths starting with R is \( C(7, 2) \times C(7, 1) = 21 \times 7 = 147 \).
   - **Starting with U**: Similarly, the number of paths starting with U is also \( C(7, 2) \times C(7, 1) = 147 \).

4. **Total Paths**: Summing the paths starting with R and U, we get a total of \( 147 + 147 = 294 \).

Therefore, the number of such paths is:

\boxed{294}
