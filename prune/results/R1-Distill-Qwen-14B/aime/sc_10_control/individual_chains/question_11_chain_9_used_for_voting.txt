Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the largest possible real part of the expression \[(75+117i)z + \frac{96+144i}{z}\], where \( z \) is a complex number with \(|z| = 4\). Hmm, complex numbers, modulus, real parts... I think I should break this down step by step.

First, I remember that any complex number \( z \) can be expressed in polar form as \( z = re^{i\theta} \), where \( r \) is the modulus and \( \theta \) is the argument. Since \(|z| = 4\), then \( r = 4 \), so \( z = 4e^{i\theta} \). Also, \( 1/z = \frac{1}{4}e^{-i\theta} \) because \(|1/z| = 1/|z| = 1/4 \).

So, substituting \( z = 4e^{i\theta} \) into the expression, we have:

\[
(75 + 117i) \cdot 4e^{i\theta} + \frac{96 + 144i}{4e^{i\theta}}
\]

Simplify each term:

First term: \( (75 + 117i) \cdot 4e^{i\theta} = 4(75 + 117i)e^{i\theta} \)

Second term: \( \frac{96 + 144i}{4e^{i\theta}} = \frac{96 + 144i}{4} e^{-i\theta} = (24 + 36i)e^{-i\theta} \)

So, the entire expression becomes:

\[
4(75 + 117i)e^{i\theta} + (24 + 36i)e^{-i\theta}
\]

Now, I can write each complex number in terms of their real and imaginary parts multiplied by \( e^{\pm i\theta} \). Remember that \( e^{i\theta} = \cos\theta + i\sin\theta \) and \( e^{-i\theta} = \cos\theta - i\sin\theta \).

Let me compute each part:

First term: \( 4(75 + 117i)(\cos\theta + i\sin\theta) \)
Let me compute \( 4(75 + 117i) \) first. 

4 * 75 = 300, 4 * 117 = 468. So, that's 300 + 468i.

Then, multiply by \( \cos\theta + i\sin\theta \):

Using distributive property: (300 + 468i)(cosθ + i sinθ) = 300 cosθ + 300 i sinθ + 468i cosθ + 468i^2 sinθ.

Since \( i^2 = -1 \), this becomes:

300 cosθ + (300 sinθ)i + 468 cosθ i - 468 sinθ.

Combine like terms:

Real parts: 300 cosθ - 468 sinθ

Imaginary parts: (300 sinθ + 468 cosθ) i

So, the first term is (300 cosθ - 468 sinθ) + (300 sinθ + 468 cosθ)i.

Second term: (24 + 36i)(cosθ - i sinθ)

Again, distribute:

24 cosθ - 24 i sinθ + 36i cosθ - 36i^2 sinθ.

Simplify, remembering \(i^2 = -1\):

24 cosθ -24 i sinθ + 36 i cosθ + 36 sinθ.

Combine like terms:

Real parts: 24 cosθ + 36 sinθ

Imaginary parts: (-24 sinθ + 36 cosθ) i

So, the second term is (24 cosθ + 36 sinθ) + (-24 sinθ + 36 cosθ)i.

Now, add the two terms together.

Let me denote the first term as A + Bi and the second term as C + Di, where:

A = 300 cosθ - 468 sinθ

B = 300 sinθ + 468 cosθ

C = 24 cosθ + 36 sinθ

D = -24 sinθ + 36 cosθ

So, adding them:

Real part: A + C = (300 cosθ - 468 sinθ) + (24 cosθ + 36 sinθ) = (300 + 24) cosθ + (-468 + 36) sinθ = 324 cosθ - 432 sinθ

Imaginary part: B + D = (300 sinθ + 468 cosθ) + (-24 sinθ + 36 cosθ) = (300 -24) sinθ + (468 +36) cosθ = 276 sinθ + 504 cosθ

But we only care about the real part of the entire expression, so we can ignore the imaginary part for now.

So, the real part is 324 cosθ - 432 sinθ.

Hmm, so I need to maximize 324 cosθ - 432 sinθ.

I remember that expressions like \( a \cos\theta + b \sin\theta \) can be rewritten as \( R \cos(\theta + \phi) \), where \( R = \sqrt{a^2 + b^2} \) and \( \phi = \arctan(b/a) \) or something like that. Wait, let me think. Actually, it's \( R \cos(\theta - \phi) \) where \( R = \sqrt{a^2 + b^2} \) and \( \phi = \arctan(b/a) \). Wait, maybe I should double-check.

Wait, the identity is \( a \cos\theta + b \sin\theta = R \cos(\theta - \phi) \), where \( R = \sqrt{a^2 + b^2} \) and \( \phi = \arctan(b/a) \). Let me verify this.

Yes, because \( R \cos(\theta - \phi) = R \cos\theta \cos\phi + R \sin\theta \sin\phi \). Comparing with \( a \cos\theta + b \sin\theta \), then \( a = R \cos\phi \), \( b = R \sin\phi \). Therefore, \( R = \sqrt{a^2 + b^2} \), and \( \tan\phi = b/a \).

In this case, the expression is 324 cosθ - 432 sinθ. So, a = 324, b = -432.

So, R = sqrt(324^2 + (-432)^2 ). Let me compute that.

First, compute 324 squared: 324 * 324. Hmm, 300^2 is 90,000, 24^2 is 576, and cross term is 2*300*24=14,400. So, (300 +24)^2 = 300^2 + 2*300*24 +24^2 = 90,000 +14,400 + 576 = 104,976.

Similarly, 432^2: 400^2=160,000, 32^2=1,024, and cross term 2*400*32=25,600. So, (400 +32)^2=160,000 +25,600 +1,024=186,624. Since b is -432, when squared it's same as 432^2.

So, R = sqrt(104,976 + 186,624) = sqrt(291,600). Let me compute sqrt(291600).

Well, 500^2=250,000, 540^2=291,600. Because 54^2=2,916, so 540^2=291,600. So, R = 540.

So, the real part is 540 cos(θ - phi), where phi is such that tan(phi) = b/a = (-432)/324.

Simplify tan(phi) = (-432)/324 = -432/324. Let me divide numerator and denominator by 108: 432 ÷108=4, 324 ÷108=3. So, -4/3.

So, tan(phi) = -4/3.

Therefore, phi is an angle whose tangent is -4/3. Since we have a negative tangent, phi is in the fourth quadrant if we take the principal value.

But when we express the phase shift, we can write phi as arctan(-4/3) or adjust accordingly. But perhaps it's better to think of it as positive by adding pi.

Wait, but for our purposes, the maximum value of 540 cos(theta - phi) is 540, since the maximum of cosine is 1. So, the maximum real part is 540.

Wait, but wait a second. Let me check. The real part is 540 cos(theta - phi). The maximum value of cosine is 1, so yes, the maximum real part is 540.

But wait, let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes in the steps.

So, the real part is 324 cosθ -432 sinθ, which we rewrote as 540 cos(theta - phi), with tan(phi)= -4/3. So, phi = arctan(-4/3). But since tangent is periodic with period pi, I can also write phi as pi - arctan(4/3) to place it in the second quadrant, but regardless, the maximum value of the expression is R, which is 540.

So, the maximum real part is 540.

Wait, but perhaps I should double-check my calculations for R.

Compute R again: sqrt(324^2 + (-432)^2) = sqrt(104,976 + 186,624) = sqrt(291,600) = 540. Yes, that's correct.

Alternatively, I can factor out common terms. Let me see if 324 and 432 have a common factor.

324 ÷ 108 = 3, 432 ÷108=4. So, 324 = 108*3, 432=108*4.

So, 324 cosθ -432 sinθ = 108*(3 cosθ -4 sinθ). Then, the expression is 108*(3 cosθ -4 sinθ).

Then, the maximum of 3 cosθ -4 sinθ is sqrt(3^2 + (-4)^2) = 5, so the maximum of the entire expression would be 108*5=540. Oh, that's another way to see it.

So, yes, that confirms the maximum is 540. So, the largest possible real part is 540.

Wait, but perhaps I should think about whether this is attainable. Since z is on the circle of radius 4, there exists a theta that makes the expression reach 540. So, yes, the maximum is 540.

So, I think that's the answer.

To find the largest possible real part of \[(75+117i)z + \frac{96+144i}{z}\] where \( z \) is a complex number with \(|z| = 4\), we express \( z \) as \( 4e^{i\theta} \). Substituting \( z \) into the expression, we simplify each term:

1. \[
(75 + 117i) \cdot 4e^{i\theta} = 4(75 + 117i)(\cos\theta + i\sin\theta)
\]
2. \[
\frac{96 + 144i}{4e^{i\theta}} = (24 + 36i)(\cos\theta - i\sin\theta)
\]

Expanding and combining like terms, the real part of the entire expression becomes:
\[
324 \cos\theta - 432 \sin\theta
\]

This can be rewritten using the identity \( a \cos\theta + b \sin\theta = R \cos(\theta - \phi) \), where \( R = \sqrt{a^2 + b^2} \). Here, \( R = \sqrt{324^2 + (-432)^2} = 540 \). The maximum value of \( \cos(\theta - \phi) \) is 1, so the largest possible real part is \( 540 \).

\[
\boxed{540}
\]
