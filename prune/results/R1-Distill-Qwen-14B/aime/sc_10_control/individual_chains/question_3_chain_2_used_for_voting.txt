Okay, so I'm trying to solve this probability problem about Jen entering a lottery. Let me read it again and make sure I understand what's being asked.

Jen picks 4 distinct numbers from the set S = {1,2,3,...,9,10}. Then, 4 numbers are randomly chosen from S. She wins a prize if at least two of her numbers match two of the randomly chosen numbers. She wins the grand prize if all four of her numbers are the ones chosen. The question is about the probability of her winning the grand prize given that she won a prize. They want this probability expressed as a fraction m/n where m and n are coprime, and then to find m + n.

Alright, so first, I think this is a conditional probability problem. The probability we're looking for is P(Grand Prize | Prize). Which, by definition, is equal to P(Grand Prize) / P(Prize). So, I need to find both the probability of winning the grand prize and the probability of winning any prize, then divide the two.

Let me start by figuring out the total number of possible ways the lottery can be drawn. Since 4 numbers are chosen from 10, the total number of possible combinations is C(10,4). I can compute that later, but for now, I'll just keep it as C(10,4).

Next, let's consider the grand prize. That's the case where all four of Jen's numbers are the ones drawn. So, how many ways can this happen? Since Jen has already picked 4 numbers, there's only 1 way that all four are drawn. So, the number of favorable outcomes for the grand prize is 1. Therefore, the probability P(Grand Prize) is 1 / C(10,4).

Now, moving on to the prize. She wins a prize if at least two of her numbers are among the four drawn. So, that includes scenarios where exactly two, exactly three, or exactly four of her numbers are drawn. Since we've already considered the four case (the grand prize), the prize includes all cases from two to four matches.

Wait, but the problem says she wins a prize if at least two of her numbers were two of the randomly chosen. So, that means exactly two, exactly three, or exactly four. So, the number of favorable outcomes for the prize is the sum of the number of ways to choose exactly two, exactly three, or exactly four of her numbers.

Let me recall how to compute these. The number of ways to choose exactly k numbers from her four is C(4, k), and then the remaining (4 - k) numbers are chosen from the remaining 6 numbers in the set S (since there are 10 - 4 = 6 numbers not chosen by Jen).

So, for exactly two matches: C(4,2) * C(6,2). Because we choose 2 from Jen's numbers and 2 from the others.

Similarly, for exactly three matches: C(4,3) * C(6,1).

And for exactly four matches: C(4,4) * C(6,0), which is 1 * 1 = 1.

Therefore, the total number of prize-winning combinations is [C(4,2)*C(6,2)] + [C(4,3)*C(6,1)] + [C(4,4)*C(6,0)].

Let me compute each term:

C(4,2) = 6, C(6,2) = 15, so the first term is 6 * 15 = 90.

C(4,3) = 4, C(6,1) = 6, so the second term is 4 * 6 = 24.

C(4,4) = 1, C(6,0) = 1, so the third term is 1 * 1 = 1.

Adding them up: 90 + 24 + 1 = 115.

So, the number of prize-winning combinations is 115. Hence, P(Prize) is 115 / C(10,4).

Now, since C(10,4) is the total number of possible 4-number combinations, let me calculate that. C(10,4) = 10! / (4! * (10-4)!) = (10*9*8*7)/(4*3*2*1) = 210.

So, C(10,4) = 210.

So, now, P(Grand Prize) is 1/210.

P(Prize) is 115/210.

Therefore, the conditional probability P(Grand Prize | Prize) is (1/210) / (115/210) = (1/210) * (210/115) = 1/115.

Wait, that simplifies to 1/115. So, m is 1, n is 115, and they are coprime because 1 and 115 share no common divisors other than 1.

Therefore, m + n = 1 + 115 = 116.

But wait, let me double-check my calculations because sometimes it's easy to make a mistake in combinatorics.

First, verifying the number of prize-winning combinations. She can have exactly two, three, or four matches.

Exactly two: C(4,2)*C(6,2) = 6*15=90. Correct.

Exactly three: C(4,3)*C(6,1)=4*6=24. Correct.

Exactly four: C(4,4)*C(6,0)=1. Correct.

Total: 90 + 24 +1 =115. Correct.

Total possible combinations: 210. Correct.

Probability of prize: 115/210. Simplify: 23/42. But for conditional probability, we have P(Grand)/P(Prize) = (1/210)/(115/210) = 1/115. So, the fraction is 1/115, which is reduced. So, m + n is 1 + 115 = 116.

Hmm, seems straightforward. But wait, let's think again. Is the conditional probability correct? The definition is P(A|B) = P(A ∩ B) / P(B). But in this case, if she won the grand prize, then she certainly won the prize. So, P(Grand Prize ∩ Prize) is just P(Grand Prize). So, yes, the formula becomes P(Grand)/P(Prize) = (1/210)/(115/210) = 1/115. So that seems correct.

Alternatively, another way to think is, given that she's won a prize, what's the chance it's the grand prize. So, the number of grand prize outcomes is 1, and the number of prize outcomes is 115. So, the probability is 1/115.

Yes, that makes sense.

So, the final answer is 1 + 115 = 116.

To solve the problem, we need to find the probability of Jen winning the grand prize given that she won a prize. This is a conditional probability problem where we use the formula:

\[
P(\text{Grand Prize} | \text{Prize}) = \frac{P(\text{Grand Prize})}{P(\text{Prize})}
\]

First, we calculate the total number of ways to choose 4 numbers from 10, which is \(\binom{10}{4} = 210\).

**Calculating \(P(\text{Grand Prize})\):**

The probability of winning the grand prize is the probability that all four of Jen's numbers are chosen. There is only 1 way this can happen, so:

\[
P(\text{Grand Prize}) = \frac{1}{210}
\]

**Calculating \(P(\text{Prize})\):**

Jen wins a prize if at least two of her numbers are chosen. This includes the cases where exactly two, three, or four of her numbers are chosen. We calculate each case:

- **Exactly two numbers:** \(\binom{4}{2} \times \binom{6}{2} = 6 \times 15 = 90\)
- **Exactly three numbers:** \(\binom{4}{3} \times \binom{6}{1} = 4 \times 6 = 24\)
- **Exactly four numbers:** \(\binom{4}{4} \times \binom{6}{0} = 1 \times 1 = 1\)

Adding these, the total number of prize-winning combinations is \(90 + 24 + 1 = 115\). Thus:

\[
P(\text{Prize}) = \frac{115}{210}
\]

**Calculating the conditional probability:**

\[
P(\text{Grand Prize} | \text{Prize}) = \frac{\frac{1}{210}}{\frac{115}{210}} = \frac{1}{115}
\]

The fraction \(\frac{1}{115}\) is already in its simplest form, so \(m = 1\) and \(n = 115\). Therefore, \(m + n = 1 + 115 = 116\).

\[
\boxed{116}
\]
