Okay, so I need to solve this math problem where I have to find the least prime number p such that there's a positive integer n where p² divides n⁴ + 1. Then, I have to find the smallest positive integer m for which m⁴ + 1 is divisible by p². Hmm, that sounds a bit tricky, but I'll try to break it down.

First, I remember that primes play a big role in number theory, especially when dealing with divisibility and modular arithmetic. So, maybe I should start by recalling some properties of primes and their relation to equations like n⁴ + 1.

I know that for a prime p, if p divides n⁴ + 1, then n⁴ ≡ -1 mod p. That implies that the order of n modulo p divides 8 because (n⁴)² ≡ 1 mod p. Wait, the order of an element a modulo p is the smallest positive integer k such that a^k ≡ 1 mod p. So if n⁴ ≡ -1 mod p, then n^8 ≡ 1 mod p. That means the order of n modulo p is 8, right? Because 8 is the smallest exponent where it becomes 1. 

But for the order to be 8, 8 must divide p-1 because the multiplicative group modulo p is cyclic with order p-1. Therefore, p ≡ 1 mod 8. So, p must be a prime that is 1 more than a multiple of 8. That narrows down the possible primes to check.

So, the primes I need to check are 17, 97, 113, etc., because 17 is the first prime that's 1 mod 8 (since 17 = 8*2 +1). Wait, actually, 17 is 8*2 +1, yeah. Let me confirm: 17 divided by 8 is 2 with a remainder of 1, so yeah, 17 is 1 mod 8. The next one is 97, then 113, and so on.

But wait, I'm not sure if 17 is the least prime where p² divides n⁴ +1. Maybe I should check smaller primes first. Wait, let's think: the least prime p where p² divides n⁴ +1 for some n. But for primes smaller than 17, like 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, etc., do they satisfy that condition?

Let me check p=2. So, does there exist an n where n⁴ +1 is divisible by 4? n⁴ is always 0 or 1 mod 4. If n is even, n⁴ is 0 mod 4, so n⁴ +1 is 1 mod 4, which isn't divisible by 4. If n is odd, n is 1 or -1 mod 4, so n⁴ is 1 mod 4, so n⁴ +1 is 2 mod 4, which isn't divisible by 4. So, p=2 doesn't work.

Next, p=3. Let's see if 3²=9 divides n⁴ +1 for some n. Let me try n=1: 1 +1=2, not divisible by 9. n=2: 16 +1=17, which is 8 mod 9. n=3: 81 +1=82, which is 1 mod 9. Hmm, maybe n=4: 256 +1=257. 257 divided by 9 is 28*9=252, so 257-252=5, so 5 mod 9. Not divisible. Hmm, maybe n=5: 625 +1=626. 626/9=69*9=621, 626-621=5, again 5 mod 9. Not working. Maybe n=7: 7⁴=2401 +1=2402. 2402 divided by 9: 2400 is 8*300, so 2402 is 8*300 + 2, so 2402 mod9 is (8+2)=10 mod9=1. So, n=7 gives 1 mod9. Seems like 3 doesn't work either.

How about p=5? Let's check if 25 divides n⁴ +1 for some n. Let's try n=2: 16 +1=17, not divisible by 25. n=3: 81 +1=82, which is 82 mod25=7. n=7: 7⁴=2401 +1=2402. 2402 mod25: 25*96=2400, so 2402 is 2 mod25. Not divisible. What about n=1: 1+1=2. No. n=4: 256 +1=257. 257 mod25 is 7. n=6: 6⁴=1296 +1=1297. 1297-25*51=1297-1275=22. So 22 mod25. Hmm, not working. Maybe n=12: 12⁴=20736 +1=20737. 20737 divided by25: 25*829=20725, so 20737-20725=12. 12 mod25. Not divisible. So p=5 doesn't work either.

Next, p=7. Let's see if 49 divides n⁴ +1. Let me try n=2: 16+1=17. n=3:81+1=82. 82 mod49=33. n=4: 256+1=257. 257 mod49: 49*5=245, 257-245=12. n=5:625+1=626. 626-49*12=626-588=38. n=6:1296+1=1297. 1297-49*26=1297-1274=23. n=7:2401+1=2402. 2402-49*49=2402-2401=1. Oh, so 2402 is 1 mod49. So n=7 gives 1 mod49. Not divisible. How about n=14: 14⁴=38416 +1=38417. Let's divide 38417 by49. 49*784=38416, so 38417 is 1 mod49 again. So same as n=7. Not working. Hmm, maybe 7 doesn't work either.

So, maybe p=17 is the first candidate. Let's check if 17²=289 divides n⁴ +1 for some n. If so, then p=17 is our prime, and then we can find the minimal m such that m⁴ +1 is divisible by 289.

But wait, is 17 the least prime? I think we've checked primes up to 7, and they don't work. Let me check p=13 next, just in case. So, p=13, and check if 13²=169 divides n⁴ +1 for some n.

Let me try n=5: 625 +1=626. 626 mod169: 169*3=507, 626-507=119. Not divisible. n=7: 2401 +1=2402. 2402 /169: 169*14=2366, 2402 -2366=36. 36 mod169. Not divisible. n=10: 10000 +1=10001. 10001 mod169: Let's calculate 169*59=9971, 10001-9971=30. So 30 mod169. Not working. n=12: 12⁴=20736 +1=20737. 20737 /169: 169*122=20558, 20737-20558=179. 179-169=10. So 10 mod169. No luck.

n=15: 15⁴=50625 +1=50626. 50626 /169: Let's see, 169*300=50700, so 50626 is 50700-74=50626. So 50626 mod169 is (50700 mod169) -74 mod169. 50700 is 169*300, so 0 mod169. So 0-74= -74 mod169=95. So 95 mod169. Not divisible.

Hmm, maybe p=13 doesn't work either. So, next is p=17. Let's see if 289 divides n⁴ +1 for some n.

I can try small n's. Let's start with n=1: 1 +1=2. No. n=2: 16 +1=17. 17 mod289=17. Not divisible. n=3: 81 +1=82. No. n=4: 256 +1=257. 257 mod289=257. Not divisible. n=5: 625 +1=626. 626-289=337. 337 mod289=48. Not divisible. n=6: 1296 +1=1297. 1297-289*4=1297-1156=141. Not divisible. n=7: 2401 +1=2402. 2402-289*8=2402-2312=90. Not divisible. n=8: 4096 +1=4097. 4097-289*14=4097-4046=51. Not divisible. n=9: 6561 +1=6562. 6562-289*22=6562-6358=204. Not divisible. n=10:10000 +1=10001. 10001-289*34=10001-9826=175. 175 mod289=175.

Hmm, maybe n=12: 12⁴=20736 +1=20737. 20737 /289: Let's compute 289*71=20519. 20737 -20519=218. 218 is less than 289, so 218 mod289. Not divisible.

n=13: 13⁴=28561 +1=28562. 28562-289*98=28562-28322=240. 240 mod289. Not zero.

n=14: 14⁴=38416 +1=38417. 38417-289*132=38417-38268=149. 149 mod289.

n=15: 15⁴=50625 +1=50626. 50626 /289: 289*175=50575. 50626-50575=51. 51 mod289.

n=16: 16⁴=65536 +1=65537. 65537 mod289: Let's compute 289*226=65494. 65537-65494=43. 43 mod289.

n=17: 17⁴=83521 +1=83522. 83522 /289: 289*289=83521. So 83522-83521=1. So 1 mod289.

Wait, maybe I need a different approach. It's taking too long to find an n for p=17. Maybe I can use some number theory to find if there exists an n such that n⁴ ≡ -1 mod 17².

Wait, I know that for primes p where p ≡ 1 mod 8, -1 is a quartic residue modulo p. So, if p ≡ 1 mod 8, then there exists some n where n⁴ ≡ -1 mod p. But for p², does such an n exist?

I think that for primes p where p ≡ 1 mod 8, and if the equation x⁴ ≡ -1 mod p² has a solution, then p² divides n⁴ +1 for some n. So, perhaps p=17 is the least such prime.

Alternatively, I remember that primes p ≡ 1 mod 8 can sometimes have solutions lifting from mod p to mod p², depending on whether the derivative of the polynomial x⁴ +1 is non-zero mod p at the root.

Wait, let me recall Hensel's lemma. If f(x) = x⁴ +1, and if f(a) ≡ 0 mod p and f'(a) not ≡ 0 mod p, then there exists a unique lifting of a to a root mod p².

So, first, I need a root a mod p where a⁴ ≡ -1 mod p, and then check whether 4a³ ≡ 0 mod p. If 4a³ is not zero mod p, which it won't be unless a ≡0 mod p, which is impossible since a⁴ ≡ -1 mod p and p is at least 2.

So, for p=17, let's see if there exists a solution to x⁴ ≡ -1 mod 17. Then, since 17 ≡ 1 mod 8, such solutions exist. Let me find such an a.

Let me compute x⁴ mod17:

Compute 1^4=1

2^4=16

3^4=81≡13 mod17

4^4=256≡1 mod17

5^4=625≡625-17*36=625-612=13 mod17

6^4=1296≡1296-17*76=1296-1292=4 mod17

7^4=2401≡2401-17*141=2401-2397=4 mod17

8^4=4096≡4096-17*241=4096-4097= -1 mod17

Ah, so x=8 mod17 is a solution because 8⁴ ≡ -1 mod17.

So, a=8 is a solution. Now, using Hensel's lemma, can we lift this to a solution mod17²=289?

The derivative f’(x) = 4x³. Evaluate at x=8: f’(8)=4*512=2048. 2048 mod17: 17*120=2040, so 2048-2040=8. So f’(8) ≡8 mod17, which is not zero. Therefore, by Hensel's lemma, there is a unique lifting of 8 mod17 to a solution mod289.

So, there exists an integer m ≡8 mod17 such that m⁴≡-1 mod289.

So, p=17 is the least prime where p² divides n⁴ +1 for some n. So, p=17 is our prime.

Now, the next part is to find the least positive integer m such that m⁴ +1 is divisible by 17²=289.

So, we need to find the minimal m>0 with m⁴ ≡ -1 mod289.

We know that m ≡8 mod17, as per the Hensel's lemma lifting.

So, m can be written as m=8+17k for some integer k≥0. We need to find the smallest k such that (8+17k)^4 ≡ -1 mod289.

So, let's compute (8 +17k)^4 mod289.

But expanding this might be tedious, but perhaps manageable.

First, note that 17²=289, so any term with 17² or higher power will be 0 mod289.

So, let's compute (8 +17k)^4 using the binomial theorem:

(8 +17k)^4 = 8^4 + 4*8^3*(17k) + 6*8^2*(17k)^2 + 4*8*(17k)^3 + (17k)^4.

But mod289, any term with (17k)^2 or higher will be 0 because (17k)^2=289k²≡0 mod289.

So, only the first two terms matter.

So, (8 +17k)^4 ≡8^4 + 4*8^3*(17k) mod289.

Compute 8^4: 4096. 4096 mod289. Let's see, 289*14=4046. 4096-4046=50. So, 8^4≡50 mod289.

Compute 4*8^3*(17k): 4*512*17k. Wait, 8^3=512.

So, 4*512*17k=4*512=2048; 2048*17k=34816k.

Wait, but 34816 mod289: since 289*120=34680, 34816-34680=136. So, 34816k≡136k mod289.

So, putting it all together, (8 +17k)^4 ≡50 +136k mod289.

We need this to be ≡-1 mod289. So,

50 +136k ≡ -1 mod289

Which is:

136k ≡ -51 mod289

Simplify: 136k ≡ 238 mod289 (since -51 +289=238)

We can write this as:

136k ≡238 mod289.

Now, we can solve for k:

k ≡238 /136 mod289.

But we need to compute the modular inverse of 136 mod289.

First, let's compute the GCD of 136 and289.

289 ÷136=2 with remainder 17 (289=2*136 +17)

136 ÷17=8 with remainder 0.

So, GCD is 17.

Wait, but 238 and136: let's check if 17 divides 238.

238 ÷17=14, because 17*14=238. So, yes, 17 divides both 136 and238.

So, the equation 136k ≡238 mod289 can be simplified by dividing both sides by17:

(136/17)k ≡238/17 mod289/17

Which is:

8k ≡14 mod17.

So, now we have:

8k ≡14 mod17.

We can solve for k:

Multiply both sides by the inverse of 8 mod17.

What's the inverse of 8 mod17? Let's find x such that 8x ≡1 mod17.

Testing x=15: 8*15=120≡120-17*7=120-119=1 mod17. So, inverse is15.

So, k ≡14 *15 mod17.

14*15=210. 210 mod17: 17*12=204, 210-204=6. So, k≡6 mod17.

So, k=6 +17t, where t is an integer ≥0.

We are looking for the smallest positive integer m=8+17k, so let's plug in k=6 first.

k=6: m=8+17*6=8+102=110.

Wait, is m=110 the minimal positive integer? Let me check m=110: compute 110^4 +1 mod289.

Alternatively, let me check if k=6 is the minimal solution, but perhaps t=0 gives k=6, which is acceptable. But wait, k is 6 mod17, so the minimal positive k is6.

So, m=8+17*6=110.

Wait, but let me make sure that 110^4 ≡-1 mod289.

Alternatively, since we have (8 +17k)^4 ≡50 +136k mod289, which for k=6 is 50 +136*6=50+816=866. 866 mod289: 289*3=867, so 866=867-1≡ -1 mod289. So yes, 866≡-1 mod289. Therefore, 110^4 ≡-1 mod289.

But wait, is there a smaller m than 110? Because 110 is quite large. Maybe there's a smaller m that also satisfies the condition.

Wait, but m must be ≡8 mod17. So, the possible m's are 8, 25 (8+17), 42, 59, 76, 93, 110, etc. So, we tried m=8,25,42,59,76,93,110.

We can compute m⁴ +1 mod289 for each of these to see if any of them satisfy the condition.

Let me start with m=8: 8⁴=4096. 4096 mod289: 289*14=4046, 4096-4046=50. So, 50 +1=51≡51 mod289≠0.

m=25: 25⁴=390625. Let's compute 390625 mod289.

But that's a big number. Maybe compute it step by step.

First, note that 25 mod289=25.

25²=625. 625 mod289: 289*2=578, 625-578=47. So, 25²≡47 mod289.

Then, 25⁴=(25²)²≡47² mod289. 47²=2209. 2209 mod289: 289*7=2023, 2209-2023=186. So, 25⁴≡186 mod289. So, 25⁴ +1=187 mod289≠0.

So, m=25 doesn't work.

Next, m=42: 42 mod289=42.

Compute 42²=1764. 1764 mod289: 289*6=1734, 1764-1734=30. So, 42²≡30 mod289.

Then, 42⁴=(42²)²≡30²=900 mod289. 900 divided by289: 289*3=867, 900-867=33. So, 42⁴≡33 mod289. 33 +1=34≠0 mod289.

So, m=42 doesn't work.

Next, m=59: 59 mod289=59.

Compute 59²=3481. 3481 mod289: 289*12=3468, 3481-3468=13. So, 59²≡13 mod289.

Then, 59⁴=(59²)²≡13²=169 mod289. 169 +1=170≠0 mod289.

Not working.

m=76: 76 mod289=76.

76²=5776. 5776 mod289: Let's compute 289*20=5780. So, 5776-5780= -4 ≡285 mod289.

So, 76²≡285 mod289.

Then, 76⁴=(76²)²≡285² mod289. 285²=81225. Let's compute 81225 mod289.

But 289*280=80920. 81225-80920=305. 305 mod289=305-289=16. So, 76⁴≡16 mod289. 16 +1=17≠0.

So, m=76 doesn't work.

m=93: 93 mod289=93.

Compute 93²=8649. 8649 mod289: 289*30=8670, so 8649=8670-21= -21 mod289≡268 mod289.

So, 93²≡268 mod289.

Then, 93⁴=(93²)²≡268² mod289. 268²=71824.

Compute 71824 mod289: Let's see, 289*248=289*(200+48)=289*200=57800, 289*48=13872, total 57800+13872=71672.

71824 -71672=152. So, 93⁴≡152 mod289. 152 +1=153≠0.

Not working.

Then, m=110: 110 mod289=110.

Compute 110²=12100. 12100 mod289: Let's see, 289*41=11849, 12100-11849=251. So, 110²≡251 mod289.

Then, 110⁴=(110²)²≡251² mod289. 251²=63001.

Compute 63001 mod289:

First, find how many times 289 fits into 63001.

289*200=57800.

63001-57800=5201.

289*18=5202, which is 1 more than 5201. So, 63001=289*200 +289*18 -1=289*218 -1.

So, 63001 mod289= (-1) mod289=288.

So, 110⁴≡288 mod289, which is -1 mod289. Therefore, 110⁴ +1 ≡0 mod289.

So, m=110 is the minimal positive integer such that m⁴ +1 is divisible by289=17².

Wait, but earlier when I was trying to compute (8 +17k)^4, I found that for k=6, m=110, which worked. So, that's the minimal m. I checked all smaller m's congruent to8 mod17, and none of them worked. So, m=110 is indeed the minimal.

So, the least prime p is17, and the minimal m is110.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To solve the problem, we need to find the smallest prime \( p \) such that there exists a positive integer \( n \) where \( p^2 \) divides \( n^4 + 1 \). Then, we must determine the smallest positive integer \( m \) for which \( m^4 + 1 \) is divisible by \( p^2 \).

### Step 1: Identify the Prime \( p \)

We start by noting that if \( p \) is a prime dividing \( n^4 + 1 \), then \( n^4 \equiv -1 \pmod{p} \). This implies that the order of \( n \) modulo \( p \) is 8, which means \( p \equiv 1 \pmod{8} \). The smallest primes congruent to 1 modulo 8 are 17, 97, 113, etc.

We check smaller primes (2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13) and find that none satisfy \( p^2 \) dividing \( n^4 + 1 \) for some \( n \). Thus, the smallest prime \( p \) is 17.

### Step 2: Find the Minimal \( m \) for \( p = 17 \)

We need the smallest \( m \) such that \( m^4 + 1 \) is divisible by \( 17^2 = 289 \). Using Hensel's lemma, we know that if \( n \equiv 8 \pmod{17} \) is a solution to \( n^4 \equiv -1 \pmod{17} \), it can be lifted to a solution modulo 289.

Let \( m = 8 + 17k \). Expanding \( (8 + 17k)^4 \) modulo 289, we find that \( k = 6 \) satisfies the condition. Thus, \( m = 8 + 17 \times 6 = 110 \).

### Final Answer

The least prime \( p \) is 17, and the minimal \( m \) is 110.

\(\boxed{110}\)
