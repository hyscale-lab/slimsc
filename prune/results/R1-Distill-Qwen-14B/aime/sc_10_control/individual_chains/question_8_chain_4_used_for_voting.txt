Alright, so I have this problem where I need to find the number of triples of nonnegative integers (a, b, c) that satisfy two conditions: a + b + c = 300 and a²b + a²c + b²a + b²c + c²a + c²b = 6,000,000. Hmm, okay, let's try to unpack this.

First, let me write down the given equations:

1. a + b + c = 300
2. a²b + a²c + b²a + b²c + c²a + c²b = 6,000,000

I need to find all nonnegative integer solutions (a, b, c) to these equations.

Looking at the second equation, I notice that each term is a product of two variables where one is squared. Maybe I can factor this expression somehow. Let me see:

a²b + a²c = a²(b + c)
Similarly, b²a + b²c = b²(a + c)
And c²a + c²b = c²(a + b)

So, the entire second equation becomes:

a²(b + c) + b²(a + c) + c²(a + b) = 6,000,000

Hmm, since a + b + c = 300, maybe I can express (b + c), (a + c), and (a + b) in terms of 300 - a, 300 - b, and 300 - c respectively.

Let me substitute:

a²(300 - a) + b²(300 - b) + c²(300 - c) = 6,000,000

Expanding each term:

= 300a² - a³ + 300b² - b³ + 300c² - c³ = 6,000,000

So, combining like terms:

300(a² + b² + c²) - (a³ + b³ + c³) = 6,000,000

Hmm, that's an interesting equation. Let me write that as:

300(a² + b² + c²) - (a³ + b³ + c³) = 6,000,000

I can factor out 300 on both sides, but maybe it's better to manipulate it differently. Let me think about the relationship between a + b + c, a² + b² + c², and a³ + b³ + c³.

I remember that for three variables, (a + b + c)^2 = a² + b² + c² + 2(ab + bc + ca). So, maybe I can express a² + b² + c² in terms of (a + b + c) and (ab + bc + ca).

Given that a + b + c = 300, let me denote S = a + b + c = 300, Q = ab + bc + ca, and P = abc.

Wait, but that might not directly help because the equation we have involves a³ + b³ + c³. Let me recall that another identity: a³ + b³ + c³ = (a + b + c)^3 - 3(a + b + c)(ab + bc + ca) + 3abc.

So, a³ + b³ + c³ = S^3 - 3S Q + 3P.

Let me plug that into our equation:

300(a² + b² + c²) - [S^3 - 3S Q + 3P] = 6,000,000

We know S is 300, so let's compute S^3:

300^3 = 27,000,000

So, substituting S:

300(a² + b² + c²) - [27,000,000 - 3*300*Q + 3P] = 6,000,000

Simplify the equation:

300(a² + b² + c²) - 27,000,000 + 900 Q - 3P = 6,000,000

Let me bring the constants to the right:

300(a² + b² + c²) + 900 Q - 3P = 6,000,000 + 27,000,000
300(a² + b² + c²) + 900 Q - 3P = 33,000,000

Hmm, now let's express a² + b² + c² using the identity:

a² + b² + c² = S^2 - 2Q = 300^2 - 2Q = 90,000 - 2Q

So, substituting back:

300*(90,000 - 2Q) + 900 Q - 3P = 33,000,000

Compute 300*90,000:

300 * 90,000 = 27,000,000

300*(-2Q) = -600 Q

So, the equation becomes:

27,000,000 - 600 Q + 900 Q - 3P = 33,000,000

Simplify terms:

27,000,000 + 300 Q - 3P = 33,000,000

Subtract 27,000,000 from both sides:

300 Q - 3P = 6,000,000

Divide both sides by 3:

100 Q - P = 2,000,000

So, 100 Q - P = 2,000,000, which implies:

P = 100 Q - 2,000,000

Hmm, so now I have an expression for P in terms of Q.

But I need to relate this back to the variables a, b, c. Since a, b, c are nonnegative integers, and S = 300, Q = ab + bc + ca, and P = abc.

I'm trying to find integer solutions (a, b, c) such that:

1. a + b + c = 300
2. Q = ab + bc + ca
3. P = abc

And we have P = 100 Q - 2,000,000

So, substituting P into the equation, we have:

abc = 100(ab + bc + ca) - 2,000,000

Let me rearrange this:

abc - 100(ab + bc + ca) = -2,000,000

Hmm, that's a bit tricky. Maybe factor out something? Let's see:

ab(c - 100) + c(-100a - 100b) = -2,000,000

Wait, that doesn't seem helpful. Maybe factor differently. Alternatively, perhaps factor 100:

abc - 100(ab + bc + ca) = -2,000,000

Divide both sides by 100:

(ab c)/100 - (ab + bc + ca) = -20,000

Hmm, but since a, b, c are integers, abc must be divisible by 100 for this to be an integer equation. So, 100 must divide abc.

Which means at least two of a, b, c must be multiples of 2 and 5, or one of them is a multiple of 100.

But perhaps this is a detour. Let me think about another approach.

Given that a, b, c are nonnegative integers summing to 300, and with P = 100 Q - 2,000,000.

Alternatively, perhaps express the equation as:

abc + 2,000,000 = 100(ab + bc + ca)

Hmm, so 100(ab + bc + ca) - abc = 2,000,000

Factor:

Let me think, perhaps factor (a - 100), (b - 100), etc., but not sure.

Alternatively, write it as:

100(ab + bc + ca) - abc = 2,000,000

I can write this as:

abc - 100(ab + bc + ca) = -2,000,000

Perhaps factor:

Let me try to factor this expression. Let's consider that expression as:

ab(c - 100) + c(-100a - 100b) = -2,000,000

Wait, that seems similar to what I did before. Alternatively, perhaps factor 100:

= 100(ab + bc + ca) - abc = 2,000,000

Hmm. Maybe we can factor this as:

ab(100 - c) + bc(100 - a) + ca(100 - b) = something?

Wait, perhaps not. Alternatively, maybe factor out something else.

Alternatively, let's consider the possibility that two variables are equal. Let's assume that a = b = c. Then, since a + b + c = 300, each would be 100. Let's check if this satisfies the second condition.

Compute a²b + a²c + b²a + b²c + c²a + c²b.

Since a = b = c = 100:

Each term is 100² * 100 = 1,000,000. There are six terms, so 6 * 1,000,000 = 6,000,000.

Which matches the second equation. So, (100, 100, 100) is a solution.

But are there other solutions where a, b, c are different?

Wait, maybe. Let's think, suppose one of them is 100, and the other two sum to 200.

Wait, suppose a = 100, then b + c = 200. Let's see if this leads to a solution.

If a = 100, then the second equation becomes:

a²b + a²c + b²a + b²c + c²a + c²b

= 100²(b + c) + b²*100 + c²*100 + bc*(a)

Wait, no, let's compute each term:

a²b = 100² * b = 10,000b

a²c = 10,000c

b²a = b²*100

c²a = c²*100

b²c = b²c

c²b = c²b

Wait, no, that's not correct. Let me list all the terms again.

Wait, the original expression is:

a²b + a²c + b²a + b²c + c²a + c²b

So, substituting a = 100:

100²b + 100²c + b²*100 + b²c + c²*100 + c²b

= 10,000(b + c) + 100b² + 100c² + bc(b + c)

But since b + c = 200, let's substitute that in:

= 10,000 * 200 + 100(b² + c²) + bc * 200

= 2,000,000 + 100(b² + c²) + 200 bc

So, the entire expression becomes:

2,000,000 + 100(b² + c²) + 200 bc = 6,000,000

Subtract 2,000,000:

100(b² + c²) + 200 bc = 4,000,000

Divide both sides by 100:

b² + c² + 2 bc = 40,000

But notice that b² + 2 bc + c² = (b + c)^2.

Which is 200² = 40,000. So,

40,000 = 40,000

Which is always true. So, when a = 100, any b and c such that b + c = 200 would satisfy the second equation.

Wait, so that suggests that any triple where one variable is 100 and the other two sum to 200 is a solution.

Similarly, if b = 100, then a + c = 200. Similarly, if c = 100, then a + b = 200.

So, how many such triples are there?

Let me count:

Case 1: a = 100. Then b + c = 200. The number of nonnegative integer solutions is 201 (since b can range from 0 to 200, and c = 200 - b).

Case 2: b = 100. Then a + c = 200. Similarly, 201 solutions.

Case 3: c = 100. Then a + b = 200. Again, 201 solutions.

But wait, we have to be careful not to double-count the case where two variables are 100. For example, if a = 100 and b = 100, then c = 100. So, the triple (100, 100, 100) is counted in all three cases.

So, the total number of triples would be 3 * (201) - 3 * 1 + 1. Wait, no. Let's think:

Each case has 201 solutions. But the triple (100, 100, 100) is included in all three cases. So, when we add the three cases, we have 3 * 201, but we've counted the triple (100,100,100) three times, while it should be counted once.

Therefore, total number of solutions is 3 * 201 - 2 * 1 = 603 - 2 = 601.

Wait, that might not be correct. Let me think again.

The number of solutions where a = 100 is 201, which includes the case where b = 100 and c = 100. Similarly, when b = 100, it includes a = 100 and c = 100, and same for c = 100.

So, the total number of distinct triples is:

Number of triples where exactly one variable is 100: 3 * (number of solutions where exactly one variable is 100).

Plus the triple where all are 100.

Wait, when a = 100, b and c sum to 200. The number of solutions where exactly one of b or c is 100 is when one is 100 and the other is 100? Wait, no.

Wait, when a = 100, b can be 100, making c = 100, which is the triple (100,100,100). The other solutions with a = 100 have either b or c not equal to 100.

So, the number of triples where exactly one variable is 100 is 3*(200). Because for a = 100, the number of solutions where b ≠ 100 and c ≠ 100 is 201 - 1 = 200. Similarly for b = 100 and c = 100.

So, number of triples where exactly one variable is 100: 3 * 200 = 600.

Plus the triple where all are 100: 1.

Total: 601.

So, that's 601 triples.

But wait, is that all? Are there other solutions where none of a, b, c is 100?

Because in the earlier reasoning, I assumed that if one variable is 100, then the other two sum to 200, and that satisfies the second equation. But what if none of the variables is 100? Could there be solutions where a, b, c are all different from 100?

Let me check.

Suppose that none of a, b, c is 100. Then, can the equation 100 Q - P = 2,000,000 hold?

Wait, in that case, from earlier:

P = 100 Q - 2,000,000

But P = abc, and Q = ab + bc + ca.

So, abc = 100(ab + bc + ca) - 2,000,000

I need to see if there exist nonnegative integers a, b, c ≠ 100 such that a + b + c = 300 and abc = 100(ab + bc + ca) - 2,000,000.

Hmm, this seems complicated. Maybe I can try to see if such solutions are possible.

Wait, let's consider small values for a. Suppose a is 0. Then, equation becomes:

0 = 100(0 + b c + 0) - 2,000,000

So, 0 = 100 bc - 2,000,000

Which implies 100 bc = 2,000,000 → bc = 20,000

But since b + c = 300, since a = 0.

So, we have b + c = 300 and bc = 20,000.

So, we can set up the quadratic equation:

x² - 300x + 20,000 = 0

Discriminant D = 90,000 - 80,000 = 10,000

So, sqrt(D) = 100

Solutions: x = [300 ± 100]/2 → x = 200 or x = 100

So, b and c would be 200 and 100.

But wait, c is 100, which is the case we already considered. So, when a = 0, we get the triple (0, 200, 100), which is already counted in the case where c = 100.

So, no new solutions here.

Similarly, if a = 1, let's see:

1 * bc = 100(1*b + 1*c + b c) - 2,000,000

But a = 1, so b + c = 299.

So, 1 * bc = 100( b + c + bc ) - 2,000,000

Simplify:

bc = 100(299 + bc) - 2,000,000

bc = 29,900 + 100 bc - 2,000,000

Bring all terms to one side:

bc - 100 bc = 29,900 - 2,000,000

-99 bc = -1,970,100

Multiply both sides by -1:

99 bc = 1,970,100

Divide both sides by 99:

bc = 1,970,100 / 99

Compute that:

1,970,100 ÷ 99.

Let me do the division:

99 * 19,900 = 99 * 20,000 = 1,980,000. So, 99 * 19,900 = 1,970,100.

So, bc = 19,900

But since b + c = 299, we have:

b + c = 299

b c = 19,900

Set up quadratic equation:

x² - 299 x + 19,900 = 0

Discriminant D = 299² - 4 * 19,900

Compute 299²: 299 * 299. Let's compute 300² = 90,000. So, 299² = (300 -1)^2 = 90,000 - 600 + 1 = 89,401

Then D = 89,401 - 79,600 = 9,801

sqrt(9,801) = 99

So, solutions x = [299 ± 99]/2 → x = (299 +99)/2= 398/2=199, and x=(299 -99)/2=200/2=100.

So, b and c would be 199 and 100.

Thus, the triple is (1,199,100), which again includes 100. So, it's already been counted in the case where c = 100.

So, no new solution here.

Similarly, if I try a = 2:

2 bc = 100(2b + 2c + bc) - 2,000,000

But a = 2, so b + c = 298

So,

2 bc = 100(298 + bc) - 2,000,000

2 bc = 29,800 + 100 bc - 2,000,000

Bring all terms to left:

2 bc - 100 bc = 29,800 - 2,000,000

-98 bc = -1,970,200

Multiply both sides by -1:

98 bc = 1,970,200

Divide by 98:

bc = 1,970,200 / 98

Calculate:

98 * 20,104 = 98 * 20,000 = 1,960,000. 1,970,200 - 1,960,000 = 10,200. 98 * 104 = 10,192. 10,200 - 10,192 = 8. So, 98 * 20,104 + 8 = 1,970,200.

Wait, that can't be exact. Maybe I made a mistake in division.

Wait, 1,970,200 ÷ 98.

Let me compute 98 * 20,100 = 98*(20,000 + 100) = 1,960,000 + 9,800 = 1,969,800.

1,970,200 - 1,969,800 = 400.

So, 400 ÷ 98 = approx 4.0816. So, it's not an integer. Thus, bc would not be an integer, which is impossible because b and c are integers.

So, no solution for a = 2.

Wait, that's interesting. So, a = 2 gives a non-integer bc, so no solution.

Similarly, maybe trying a = 3:

3 bc = 100(3b + 3c + bc) - 2,000,000

But a = 3, so b + c = 297

So,

3 bc = 100(297 + bc) - 2,000,000

3 bc = 29,700 + 100 bc - 2,000,000

Bring all terms to left:

3 bc - 100 bc = 29,700 - 2,000,000

-97 bc = -1,970,300

Multiply by -1:

97 bc = 1,970,300

Divide by 97:

bc = 1,970,300 / 97

Compute 97 * 20,314: 97 * 20,000 = 1,940,000. 97 * 314 = ?

Compute 97 * 300 = 29,100

97 * 14 = 1,358

Total: 29,100 + 1,358 = 30,458

So, 97 * 20,314 = 1,940,000 + 30,458 = 1,970,458

But 1,970,300 is less than that. So, 1,970,300 - 1,970,458 = -158. Not exact, so bc is not an integer.

Thus, no solution for a = 3.

Hmm, seems like for a = 1, we get bc = 19,900, which leads to b and c as 199 and 100, which is already counted.

For a = 0, similar thing.

For a = 100, we have triples where other variables sum to 200, which are already covered.

So, perhaps the only solutions are those where one variable is 100, and the other two sum to 200.

Hence, the total number of triples is 601.

Wait, but let me confirm. Are there any solutions where none of the variables is 100 and all are different?

Suppose a, b, c are all different and none is 100.

Is that possible?

Let me try to find such a solution.

Suppose a = 50, then b + c = 250.

We have:

50²b + 50²c + b²*50 + b²c + c²*50 + c²b = ?

Wait, let me compute this:

Compute each term:

a²b = 2500 b

a²c = 2500 c

b²a = 50 b²

b²c = b²c

c²a = 50 c²

c²b = c²b

So, summing all terms:

2500(b + c) + 50(b² + c²) + bc(b + c)

But since b + c = 250, and a = 50.

So,

2500 * 250 + 50(b² + c²) + bc * 250

= 625,000 + 50(b² + c²) + 250 bc

This must equal 6,000,000.

So,

625,000 + 50(b² + c²) + 250 bc = 6,000,000

Subtract 625,000:

50(b² + c²) + 250 bc = 5,375,000

Divide both sides by 50:

b² + c² + 5 bc = 107,500

But since b + c = 250, let me express c = 250 - b.

Substitute c:

b² + (250 - b)^2 + 5b(250 - b) = 107,500

Expand:

b² + (62,500 - 500b + b²) + 5*(250b - b²) = 107,500

Simplify:

b² + 62,500 - 500b + b² + 1,250b - 5b² = 107,500

Combine like terms:

(1 + 1 -5) b² + (-500b + 1,250b) + 62,500 = 107,500

= (-3b²) + 750b + 62,500 = 107,500

Bring all terms to left:

-3b² + 750b + 62,500 - 107,500 = 0

Simplify:

-3b² + 750b - 45,000 = 0

Multiply both sides by -1:

3b² - 750b + 45,000 = 0

Divide by 3:

b² - 250b + 15,000 = 0

Compute discriminant D = 250² - 4*1*15,000 = 62,500 - 60,000 = 2,500

sqrt(D) = 50

Solutions:

b = [250 ± 50]/2 → (300)/2=150 or (200)/2=100

So, b = 150 or 100.

Thus, if a = 50, then b = 150, c = 100.

But c = 100, which is the case we've already considered.

Alternatively, if b = 100, then c = 150, but again, one variable is 100.

So, even when a = 50, we end up with one variable being 100.

Hmm, so it seems that in any case, one of the variables ends up being 100.

Wait, let's try another approach. Suppose that none of a, b, c is 100, but all three are different. Let's see if that's possible.

Let me pick a = 150, then b + c = 150.

Compute the second equation:

a²b + a²c + b²a + b²c + c²a + c²b

= 150²b + 150²c + b²*150 + b²c + c²*150 + c²b

= 22500(b + c) + 150(b² + c²) + bc(b + c)

Since b + c = 150,

= 22500 * 150 + 150(b² + c²) + bc * 150

= 3,375,000 + 150(b² + c²) + 150 bc

Set equal to 6,000,000:

3,375,000 + 150(b² + c² + bc) = 6,000,000

Subtract 3,375,000:

150(b² + c² + bc) = 2,625,000

Divide by 150:

b² + c² + bc = 17,500

But since b + c = 150, let me set c = 150 - b.

Substitute:

b² + (150 - b)^2 + b(150 - b) = 17,500

Expand:

b² + (22,500 - 300b + b²) + (150b - b²) = 17,500

Simplify:

b² + 22,500 - 300b + b² + 150b - b² = 17,500

Combine like terms:

(1 + 1 - 1) b² + (-300b + 150b) + 22,500 = 17,500

= b² - 150b + 22,500 = 17,500

Bring all terms to left:

b² - 150b + 5,000 = 0

Compute discriminant D = 22,500 - 20,000 = 2,500

sqrt(D) = 50

Solutions:

b = [150 ± 50]/2 → 100 or 50.

Thus, b = 100 or 50. So, if a = 150, then b = 100, c = 50, or b =50, c=100. Either way, one of the variables is 100.

Hmm, so even when a = 150, we end up with another variable being 100.

This seems to suggest that all solutions must have at least one variable equal to 100.

Is that necessarily the case?

Suppose, for contradiction, that all variables are different from 100. Then, from the equation P = 100 Q - 2,000,000, which is abc = 100(ab + bc + ca) - 2,000,000.

But wait, if none of a, b, c is 100, then a, b, c ≤ 99 or ≥ 101.

But perhaps, in that case, abc would be significantly larger or smaller? Let me think.

Wait, perhaps trying a = 200, then b + c = 100.

Compute the second equation:

a²b + a²c + b²a + b²c + c²a + c²b

= 200²b + 200²c + b²*200 + b²c + c²*200 + c²b

= 40,000(b + c) + 200(b² + c²) + bc(b + c)

Since b + c = 100,

= 40,000 * 100 + 200(b² + c²) + bc * 100

= 4,000,000 + 200(b² + c²) + 100 bc

Set equal to 6,000,000:

4,000,000 + 200(b² + c²) + 100 bc = 6,000,000

Subtract 4,000,000:

200(b² + c²) + 100 bc = 2,000,000

Divide by 100:

2(b² + c²) + bc = 20,000

Express c = 100 - b:

2(b² + (100 - b)^2) + b(100 - b) = 20,000

Expand:

2(b² + 10,000 - 200b + b²) + 100b - b² = 20,000

Simplify:

2(2b² - 200b + 10,000) + 100b - b² = 20,000

= 4b² - 400b + 20,000 + 100b - b² = 20,000

Combine like terms:

3b² - 300b + 20,000 = 20,000

Subtract 20,000:

3b² - 300b = 0

Factor:

3b(b - 100) = 0

Solutions: b = 0 or b = 100

If b = 0, then c = 100. So, triple is (200, 0, 100), which is already counted in the case where c = 100.

If b = 100, then c = 0. So, triple is (200, 100, 0), which is also already counted.

Thus, no new solutions where a =200.

Hmm, so from all these trials, it seems that whenever we set one variable to a value other than 100, we end up with another variable being 100. So, perhaps all solutions must include at least one variable equal to 100.

Therefore, the only solutions are those where exactly one variable is 100, and the other two sum to 200, or all three variables are 100.

So, the number of such triples is:

Number of triples where exactly one variable is 100: 3 * (number of triples where one variable is 100 and the other two sum to 200, excluding the case where both are 100).

Plus the triple where all are 100.

Wait, earlier, I calculated that when a = 100, the number of solutions is 201, which includes the case where b = 100 and c = 100.

Similarly for the other variables.

So, the total number of triples is 3 * 201 - 2 * 1 = 601.

But wait, let me clarify:

Each case (a=100, b=100, c=100) has 201 solutions, including the triple (100, 100, 100). So, when we add all three cases, we have 3 * 201 = 603, but we have counted (100,100,100) three times. So, to correct for overcounting, we subtract 2.

Thus, total number of distinct triples is 603 - 2 = 601.

Therefore, the answer should be 601.

But wait, let me double-check this reasoning.

Each variable being 100 gives 201 solutions. So:

- For a=100: 201 solutions (including (100,100,100))
- For b=100: 201 solutions (including (100,100,100))
- For c=100: 201 solutions (including (100,100,100))

Total before removing duplicates: 3 * 201 = 603

But (100,100,100) is counted three times. So, subtract 2 to count it once.

Thus, total distinct solutions: 603 - 2 = 601.

Yes, that makes sense.

Therefore, the number of triples is 601.

To solve the problem, we analyze the given equations:

1. \( a + b + c = 300 \)
2. \( a^2b + a^2c + b^2a + b^2c + c^2a + c^2b = 6,000,000 \)

We rewrite the second equation using the identity \( a^2b + a^2c + b^2a + b^2c + c^2a + c^2b = a^2(b + c) + b^2(a + c) + c^2(a + b) \). Substituting \( b + c = 300 - a \), \( a + c = 300 - b \), and \( a + b = 300 - c \), we get:

\[
a^2(300 - a) + b^2(300 - b) + c^2(300 - c) = 6,000,000
\]

Expanding and simplifying:

\[
300(a^2 + b^2 + c^2) - (a^3 + b^3 + c^3) = 6,000,000
\]

Using the identity \( a^3 + b^3 + c^3 = (a + b + c)^3 - 3(a + b + c)(ab + bc + ca) + 3abc \), we substitute \( a + b + c = 300 \) and simplify further:

\[
300(a^2 + b^2 + c^2) - [27,000,000 - 900(ab + bc + ca) + 3abc] = 6,000,000
\]

This simplifies to:

\[
100(ab + bc + ca) - abc = 2,000,000
\]

Let \( S = a + b + c = 300 \), \( Q = ab + bc + ca \), and \( P = abc \). The equation becomes:

\[
100Q - P = 2,000,000 \quad \Rightarrow \quad P = 100Q - 2,000,000
\]

We find that the only solutions occur when one variable is 100, and the other two sum to 200. For each variable set to 100, there are 201 solutions (including cases where other variables are 100). However, the triple (100, 100, 100) is counted three times, so we subtract 2 to count it once.

Thus, the total number of distinct triples is:

\[
3 \times 201 - 2 = 601
\]

The final answer is:

\boxed{601}
