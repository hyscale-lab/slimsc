Okay, so I'm trying to solve this geometry problem. Let me read it again and try to understand what it's saying.

We have three points: O at (0,0), A at (1/2, 0), and B at (0, sqrt(3)/2). So, O is the origin, A is on the x-axis, and B is on the y-axis. 

Then, there's this family F of line segments PQ. Each PQ is of unit length (so length 1) lying in the first quadrant. Point P is on the x-axis, and Q is on the y-axis. So, each segment PQ starts on the x-axis somewhere, ends on the y-axis somewhere, and has length 1.

So, for example, if P is at (a,0) and Q is at (0,b), then the distance between them is sqrt(a² + b²) = 1. So, a² + b² = 1. That makes sense.

Now, the family F consists of all such segments PQ. So, imagine sliding a segment PQ of length 1 along the x and y axes in the first quadrant. Each such position is a member of F.

The problem says that there's a unique point C on segment AB, distinct from A and B, that doesn't belong to any segment from F other than AB itself. So, AB is one of these segments PQ, right? Because A is on the x-axis and B is on the y-axis, so AB is a segment from F.

So, point C is on AB. It's the only point on AB that isn't on any other segment from F. So, if I think about all these other segments PQ from F, none of them pass through C except AB.

We need to find OC², where O is the origin. Then express that as a fraction p/q, with p and q coprime, and find p + q.

Hmm. So, I need to find the coordinates of point C on AB such that it doesn't lie on any other segment from F except AB.

Let me try to visualize this. AB is a line segment from (1/2,0) to (0, sqrt(3)/2). So, AB is like a diagonal line in the first quadrant. The family F consists of all possible segments PQ of length 1 from the x-axis to y-axis.

Each such PQ can be parameterized. Let me think: if P is at (a,0), then Q must be at (0, sqrt(1 - a²)) because a² + b² = 1. So, as a varies from 0 to 1, Q moves from (0,1) down to (0,0). Similarly, as a goes from 0 to 1, the segment PQ sweeps across the first quadrant.

Each of these PQ segments can be represented as the line connecting (a, 0) and (0, sqrt(1 - a²)). So, the equation of PQ for a specific a is:

y = (-sqrt(1 - a²)/a) x + sqrt(1 - a²)

Because the slope is (sqrt(1 - a²) - 0)/(0 - a) = -sqrt(1 - a²)/a.

So, equation: y = m x + c, where m = -sqrt(1 - a²)/a and c = sqrt(1 - a²).

Wait, but that's for a specific a. So, each PQ corresponds to a specific a between 0 and 1.

Now, AB is a specific PQ with a = 1/2. Let me check: if a is 1/2, then b = sqrt(1 - (1/2)^2) = sqrt(3)/2, which is exactly point B. So, AB is the segment when a = 1/2.

So, the equation of AB is y = (-sqrt(3)/2 / (1/2)) x + sqrt(3)/2 = (-sqrt(3))x + sqrt(3)/2.

So, AB has the equation y = -sqrt(3) x + sqrt(3)/2.

Now, the point C is on AB, so its coordinates can be parameterized. Let's say C is at some point between A and B. Let's parameterize AB. Let me use a parameter t, where t=0 corresponds to A (1/2, 0) and t=1 corresponds to B (0, sqrt(3)/2). So, the parametric equations would be:

x = (1/2)(1 - t)
y = (sqrt(3)/2) t

So, for t between 0 and 1, we get all points on AB from A to B.

So, point C is ( (1/2)(1 - t), (sqrt(3)/2) t ) for some t between 0 and 1, and t not 0 or 1 since C is distinct from A and B.

Our goal is to find t such that C is not on any other PQ segment from F except AB.

So, for point C to not lie on any other PQ, the equation of that PQ must not be satisfied when we plug in C's coordinates.

So, let's suppose that C is on another PQ from F, with parameter a. Then, substituting x = (1/2)(1 - t) and y = (sqrt(3)/2) t into the equation of PQ (which is y = (-sqrt(1 - a²)/a) x + sqrt(1 - a²)).

So, plug in:

(sqrt(3)/2) t = (-sqrt(1 - a²)/a) * (1/2)(1 - t) + sqrt(1 - a²)

Simplify:

Multiply both sides by 2a to eliminate denominators:

sqrt(3) t a = -sqrt(1 - a²)(1 - t) + 2a sqrt(1 - a²)

Hmm, not sure if that's the best approach. Alternatively, maybe express the condition that C lies on PQ for some a, then solve for a in terms of t, and find the t for which there's no solution a except a = 1/2.

Wait, but AB is the only PQ that passes through C. So, for other a's, if any, the equation above must have no solution except a = 1/2.

Wait, but we can think of this as for each t, the equation in a must have a solution only when a = 1/2.

Alternatively, let's think about point C lying on AB, so we can express its coordinates as (x, y) = ( (1/2)(1 - t), (sqrt(3)/2) t ). Now, we want that for any a not equal to 1/2, the point C does not lie on PQ(a), the segment PQ for parameter a.

So, for a ≠ 1/2, substituting x and y into the equation of PQ(a):

y = (-sqrt(1 - a²)/a) x + sqrt(1 - a²)

So,

(sqrt(3)/2) t = (-sqrt(1 - a²)/a) * (1/2)(1 - t) + sqrt(1 - a²)

Let me write that more clearly:

(sqrt(3)/2) t = [ -sqrt(1 - a²) / a ] * (1/2)(1 - t) + sqrt(1 - a²)

Multiply through by 2a to eliminate denominators:

sqrt(3) t a = -sqrt(1 - a²)(1 - t) + 2a sqrt(1 - a²)

Let me rearrange terms:

sqrt(3) t a = sqrt(1 - a²) [ - (1 - t) + 2a ]

Hmm, let's factor sqrt(1 - a²):

sqrt(3) t a = sqrt(1 - a²) [ 2a - (1 - t) ]

So, now, let's square both sides to eliminate the square roots. But wait, I need to be cautious because squaring can introduce extraneous solutions.

So, square both sides:

(3 t² a²) = (1 - a²) [ 2a - (1 - t) ]²

This seems complicated, but perhaps manageable.

Let me denote the right-hand side as (1 - a²)(2a - 1 + t)^2.

Let me expand [2a - (1 - t)]²:

= (2a - 1 + t)^2
= (2a + (t - 1))^2
= 4a² + 4a(t - 1) + (t - 1)^2

So, the equation becomes:

3 t² a² = (1 - a²)(4a² + 4a(t - 1) + (t - 1)^2)

Let me expand the right-hand side:

= (1 - a²)(4a² + 4a(t - 1) + (t - 1)^2)
= 4a² + 4a(t - 1) + (t - 1)^2 - a² [4a² + 4a(t - 1) + (t - 1)^2]

So, that's 4a² + 4a(t - 1) + (t - 1)^2 - 4a^4 - 4a^3(t - 1) - a²(t - 1)^2

That's a bit messy, but let me write it out term by term:

= 4a² + 4a(t - 1) + (t - 1)^2 
- 4a^4 
- 4a^3(t - 1) 
- a²(t - 1)^2

So, the left-hand side is 3t² a². So, moving everything to one side:

3 t² a² - [4a² + 4a(t - 1) + (t - 1)^2 - 4a^4 - 4a^3(t - 1) - a²(t - 1)^2] = 0

Let me expand each term:

Let me compute each term:

= 3t² a² - 4a² - 4a(t - 1) - (t - 1)^2 + 4a^4 + 4a^3(t - 1) + a²(t - 1)^2 = 0

Now, collect like terms:

Let's group terms by powers of a:

a^4: 4a^4

a^3: 4(t - 1) a^3

a²: [3t² - 4 + (t - 1)^2] a²

a terms: [ -4(t - 1) ] a

constants: [ - (t - 1)^2 ]

So, putting it all together:

4a^4 + 4(t - 1)a^3 + [3t² - 4 + (t - 1)^2] a² - 4(t - 1) a - (t - 1)^2 = 0

Let me simplify the coefficients step by step.

First, compute (t - 1)^2 = t² - 2t + 1.

Then, the coefficient of a²:

3t² -4 + t² -2t +1 = 4t² - 2t -3

So, the equation becomes:

4a^4 + 4(t - 1)a^3 + (4t² - 2t -3) a² -4(t - 1)a - (t² - 2t +1) = 0

Let me write that:

4a^4 + 4(t-1)a^3 + (4t² - 2t -3)a² -4(t -1)a - (t² -2t +1) = 0

Hmm. This is a quartic equation in a. We want this equation to have a solution for a only when a = 1/2. So, perhaps a = 1/2 is a root, and the other roots are either complex or don't correspond to real a in [0,1].

Wait, so if we plug a = 1/2 into the equation, it should satisfy it. Let's check:

Compute each term at a = 1/2:

4*(1/2)^4 = 4*(1/16) = 1/4

4(t-1)*(1/2)^3 = 4(t-1)*(1/8) = (t-1)/2

(4t² - 2t -3)*(1/2)^2 = (4t² -2t -3)*(1/4) = (4t² -2t -3)/4

-4(t -1)*(1/2) = -2(t -1)

- (t² -2t +1) = -t² +2t -1

So, sum all terms:

1/4 + (t -1)/2 + (4t² -2t -3)/4 -2(t -1) -t² +2t -1

Let me compute each term step by step:

1. 1/4
2. (t-1)/2 = (t/2 - 1/2)
3. (4t² -2t -3)/4 = t² - (t/2) - 3/4
4. -2(t-1) = -2t +2
5. -t²
6. +2t
7. -1

Now, add all together:

1/4 + t/2 -1/2 + t² - t/2 - 3/4 -2t +2 -t² +2t -1

Let's combine like terms:

t² terms: t² - t² = 0

t terms: t/2 - t/2 -2t +2t = 0

Constants: 1/4 -1/2 -3/4 +2 -1

Compute constants:

1/4 - 1/2 = -1/4

-1/4 -3/4 = -1

-1 + 2 = 1

1 -1 = 0

So, when a = 1/2, the equation equals zero, which is correct.

So, a = 1/2 is a root. Let's factor (a - 1/2) out of the quartic equation. Alternatively, perhaps factor (2a -1) to make it easier.

Alternatively, maybe perform polynomial division.

Let me write the quartic as:

4a^4 + 4(t-1)a^3 + (4t² -2t -3)a² -4(t -1)a - (t² -2t +1) = 0

Let me attempt to factor (a - 1/2) or (2a -1).

Since a = 1/2 is a root, 2a -1 is a factor.

Let me perform polynomial division or use synthetic division.

But this might be time-consuming. Alternatively, perhaps factor by grouping.

Alternatively, let me denote the quartic as P(a) = 0.

We can write P(a) = (2a -1) Q(a), where Q(a) is a cubic polynomial.

Let me perform the division.

Let me denote:

Dividend: 4a^4 +4(t-1) a^3 + (4t² -2t -3) a² -4(t-1)a - (t² -2t +1)

Divisor: 2a -1.

Let me set it up:

Divide 4a^4 by (2a -1). The first term is (4a^4)/(2a) = 2a^3.

Multiply (2a -1) by 2a^3: 4a^4 -2a^3.

Subtract this from the dividend:

(4a^4 +4(t-1)a^3 + ...) - (4a^4 -2a^3) = [0a^4] + [4(t-1)a^3 +2a^3] + ... 

= [4(t-1) +2]a^3 + ... 

= (4t -4 +2)a^3 = (4t -2)a^3.

Bring down the next term: (4t² -2t -3)a².

So, now, the new dividend is (4t -2)a^3 + (4t² -2t -3)a².

Divide (4t -2)a^3 by (2a): (4t -2)a^2 / 2a = (2t -1)a².

Multiply (2a -1) by (2t -1)a²: 4t a^3 -2a^2 - (2t -1)a² ?

Wait, let me compute it correctly:

(2a -1)*(2t -1)a² = (2a*(2t -1) -1*(2t -1)) a² = (4t a - 2a - 2t +1) a².

Wait, actually, no. Wait, (2a -1)*(2t -1)a² = (2a -1)(2t -1) a² = [ (2a)(2t -1) -1*(2t -1) ] a² = [4t a -2a -2t +1] a². Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating.

Wait, perhaps it's better to compute each multiplication step by step.

Wait, alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the approach. Maybe instead of performing polynomial division, I can use the fact that a = 1/2 is a root, and factor the quartic as (2a -1)(cubic). But this might take a while.

Alternatively, perhaps there's a smarter way. Since point C is on AB, and we want it not to lie on any other PQ, meaning that the quartic equation in a has only a = 1/2 as a real root in [0,1]. So, perhaps the quartic equation can be factored as (2a -1)(quadratic)² or something, but not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the equation has a double root at a = 1/2, making it tangent, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, think geometrically: perhaps the point C is the point where AB is tangent to some envelope of the family F. The envelope of all segments PQ would form a curve, and if AB is tangent to this envelope at C, then C is the only point where AB meets the envelope, hence AB is the only PQ passing through C.

Wait, that might be a fruitful approach. So, perhaps the envelope of the family F of segments PQ is a curve, and AB is tangent to this envelope at C. Then, C would be the only point on AB that lies on the envelope, hence the only point that lies on any PQ from F is AB itself.

So, maybe I can find the envelope of the family F and then find where AB is tangent to this envelope.

Let me recall that the envelope of a family of curves f(a, x, y) = 0 is found by solving the system:

f(a, x, y) = 0
df/da = 0

So, for each a, the envelope satisfies both equations.

In our case, the family F consists of lines PQ(a), each given by y = (-sqrt(1 - a²)/a) x + sqrt(1 - a²).

Let me write this as f(a, x, y) = y + (sqrt(1 - a²)/a) x - sqrt(1 - a²) = 0.

So, f(a, x, y) = y + (sqrt(1 - a²)/a) x - sqrt(1 - a²) = 0.

Compute df/da:

df/da = d/da [ y + (sqrt(1 - a²)/a) x - sqrt(1 - a²) ]

Since y and x are variables, their derivatives with respect to a are zero. So,

df/da = [ ( (1/(2 sqrt(1 - a²))) * (-2a) ) / a ) x ] - [ (1/(2 sqrt(1 - a²))) * (-2a) ) ]

Simplify:

First term: [ (-a)/(sqrt(1 - a²) * a) ) ] x = (-1)/sqrt(1 - a²) * x

Second term: [ a / sqrt(1 - a²) ]

So, df/da = (-x)/sqrt(1 - a²) + a / sqrt(1 - a²) = (a - x)/sqrt(1 - a²)

So, the envelope condition is:

1. f(a, x, y) = 0: y + (sqrt(1 - a²)/a) x - sqrt(1 - a²) = 0
2. df/da = 0: (a - x)/sqrt(1 - a²) = 0

From the second equation, (a - x)/sqrt(1 - a²) = 0 implies a - x = 0, so x = a.

So, substituting x = a into the first equation:

y + (sqrt(1 - a²)/a) * a - sqrt(1 - a²) = y + sqrt(1 - a²) - sqrt(1 - a²) = y = 0.

Wait, that can't be right because then y = 0. But the line y=0 is the x-axis, and all segments PQ start on the x-axis, but the envelope should be a curve in the first quadrant.

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in computing df/da.

Wait, let me double-check the differentiation.

f(a, x, y) = y + (sqrt(1 - a²)/a) x - sqrt(1 - a²) = 0

df/da = derivative of f with respect to a:

= 0 + [ derivative of (sqrt(1 - a²)/a) * x ] - [ derivative of sqrt(1 - a²) ]

So, derivative of sqrt(1 - a²) is (1/(2 sqrt(1 - a²))) * (-2a) )= -a / sqrt(1 - a²)

Now, derivative of (sqrt(1 - a²)/a) is:

Let me compute d/da [ sqrt(1 - a²) / a ].

Let me denote u = sqrt(1 - a²), v = a.

So, d/da (u/v) = (u' v - u v') / v².

Compute u' = (1/(2 sqrt(1 - a²))) * (-2a) )= -a / sqrt(1 - a²)

v' = 1

So, d/da (u/v) = [ (-a / sqrt(1 - a²)) * a - sqrt(1 - a²) * 1 ] / a²

= [ (-a² / sqrt(1 - a²) ) - sqrt(1 - a²) ] / a²

= [ (-a² - (1 - a²)) / sqrt(1 - a²) ] / a²

= [ (-a² -1 + a² ) / sqrt(1 - a²) ] / a²

= [ (-1) / sqrt(1 - a²) ] / a²

= -1 / (a² sqrt(1 - a²))

So, putting it all together, df/da = [ -1 / (a² sqrt(1 - a²)) ] * x - [ -a / sqrt(1 - a²) ]

Simplify:

df/da = (-x)/(a² sqrt(1 - a²)) + a / sqrt(1 - a²)

Factor out 1 / sqrt(1 - a²):

= [ (-x)/(a²) + a ] / sqrt(1 - a²)

Set df/da = 0:

[ (-x)/(a²) + a ] / sqrt(1 - a²) = 0

So, numerator must be zero:

(-x)/(a²) + a = 0

Multiply both sides by a²:

-x + a^3 = 0 → x = a^3

So, from the envelope condition, x = a^3.

Now, substitute x = a^3 into f(a, x, y) = 0:

y + (sqrt(1 - a²)/a) * a^3 - sqrt(1 - a²) = 0

Simplify:

y + (sqrt(1 - a²) * a^2) - sqrt(1 - a²) = 0

Factor sqrt(1 - a²):

y + sqrt(1 - a²)(a^2 - 1) = 0

But a^2 - 1 = -(1 - a^2), so:

y - sqrt(1 - a²)(1 - a^2) = 0 → y = sqrt(1 - a²) (1 - a^2)

= (1 - a^2)^(3/2)

So, the envelope is parametric equations:

x = a^3
y = (1 - a^2)^(3/2)

So, we can express y in terms of x. Let me try to eliminate the parameter a.

We have x = a^3 → a = x^(1/3)

Then, y = (1 - a^2)^(3/2) = (1 - x^(2/3))^(3/2)

So, the envelope is the curve y = (1 - x^(2/3))^(3/2)

Let me check for a=1/2:

x = (1/2)^3 = 1/8

y = (1 - (1/2)^2 )^(3/2) = (3/4)^(3/2) = (sqrt(3)/2)^3 = (3 sqrt(3))/8

So, point on envelope when a=1/2 is (1/8, 3 sqrt(3)/8 )

Which is exactly point C if t is chosen such that C is (1/8, 3 sqrt(3)/8 )

Wait, because AB is parameterized as ( (1/2)(1 - t), (sqrt(3)/2) t )

So, set (1/2)(1 - t) = 1/8 → 1 - t = 1/4 → t = 3/4

Then, y = (sqrt(3)/2) * 3/4 = 3 sqrt(3)/8, which matches. So, point C is at t=3/4 on AB, and it lies on the envelope.

Since the envelope is the boundary of the family F, and AB is tangent to the envelope at C, then C is the only point where AB meets any PQ from F, which is the condition in the problem.

So, now, point C is at (1/8, 3 sqrt(3)/8 )

So, OC² is (1/8)^2 + (3 sqrt(3)/8)^2 = (1 + 27)/64 = 28/64 = 7/16

Wait, 1/8 squared is 1/64, and (3√3/8)^2 is 9*3 /64 = 27/64. So, adding 1 +27 = 28, so 28/64 = 7/16.

So, OC² is 7/16, so p=7, q=16, so p+q=23.

Wait, wait, that seems straightforward, but let me make sure.

Wait, another way to compute OC² is using the coordinates of C. From earlier steps, C is at (1/8, 3√3/8). So,

OC² = (1/8)^2 + (3√3/8)^2 = (1 + 27)/64 = 28/64 = 7/16.

Yes, that's correct.

So, the answer is 7 + 16 = 23.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To solve the problem, we analyze the family of segments PQ of unit length in the first quadrant, where P is on the x-axis and Q is on the y-axis. Each segment PQ can be parameterized by a point P at (a, 0) and Q at (0, √(1 - a²)). The equation of the line PQ for a specific parameter a is derived as y = (-√(1 - a²)/a)x + √(1 - a²).

The segment AB is a specific case of PQ with a = 1/2, giving the equation y = -√3 x + √3/2. We need to find a point C on AB such that it does not lie on any other segment from the family F except AB.

We parameterize AB as ( (1/2)(1 - t), (√3/2) t ) for t ∈ [0, 1]. The goal is to find t such that C does not lie on any other PQ segment. 

To find the envelope of the family F, we use the method of finding the envelope of curves. The envelope is found by solving the system:
1. f(a, x, y) = y + (√(1 - a²)/a)x - √(1 - a²) = 0
2. df/da = 0

After differentiation and simplification, we find the envelope to be the parametric curve x = a³ and y = (1 - a²)^(3/2). 

We determine that point C, where AB is tangent to this envelope, corresponds to a = 1/2. Substituting a = 1/2 into the parametric equations, we find C at (1/8, 3√3/8).

Finally, we compute OC² as (1/8)² + (3√3/8)² = 1/64 + 27/64 = 28/64 = 7/16. Thus, p = 7 and q = 16, giving p + q = 23.

**Answer:** \boxed{23}
