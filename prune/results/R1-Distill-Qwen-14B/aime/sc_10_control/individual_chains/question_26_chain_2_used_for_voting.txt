Okay, so I have this geometry problem here. Let me try to understand it step by step. The problem is about triangle ABC inscribed in a circle ω. The tangents to ω at B and C intersect at point D. Then, the line AD intersects ω again at point P. The sides AB, BC, and AC are given as 5, 9, and 10 units respectively. I need to find the length of AP, express it as a fraction m/n where m and n are coprime, and then find m + n.

First, I should probably sketch a rough diagram to visualize the problem. But since there's already an Asymptote figure provided, I can refer to that. So, triangle ABC with AB=5, BC=9, AC=10. The circle ω is the circumcircle of ABC.

Next, the tangents at B and C meet at D. Tangents from a common external point to a circle are equal in length, so BD = CD. That's a property I remember. Also, since D is the intersection of the two tangents, it's called the ex-pole or something like that. Hmm, maybe it's the ex-similicenter or something else?

Wait, actually, D is the ex-pole with respect to triangle ABC, but I might be mixing terms here. Anyway, moving on. The line AD intersects the circumcircle ω again at P. So, point P is the second intersection point of AD with ω. I need to find AP.

I think I need to use some properties of circles, tangents, and maybe some power of a point. The Power of a Point theorem states that for a point outside a circle, the square of the tangent is equal to the product of the lengths from that point to the points where a line through it intersects the circle.

In this case, point D is outside the circle ω, and the tangent from D to ω is DB and DC. So, the power of D with respect to ω is DB² = DC². Also, when line AD passes through ω, intersecting it at A and P, the power of D can also be expressed as DA * DP.

So, according to the power of a point: DB² = DA * DP.

That seems useful. So if I can find DB, then I can relate it to DA and DP. But I don't know DA or DP yet. Maybe I can find DB first?

To find DB, I need to find the length of the tangent from D to ω. But I don't know where D is exactly, so maybe I can find the coordinates of D or find some relation using triangle ABC.

Alternatively, maybe I can compute the circumradius of triangle ABC first since the circle ω is the circumcircle. If I can find the circumradius R, then perhaps I can find DB using some triangle properties.

Let me compute the circumradius of triangle ABC. The sides are a = BC = 9, b = AC = 10, c = AB = 5. Wait, hold on, in the standard notation, a is BC, which is opposite angle A. So, side a is opposite angle A, which is BC = 9. Side b is AC = 10, opposite angle B, and side c is AB = 5, opposite angle C.

The formula for the circumradius R is (a*b*c)/(4*Δ), where Δ is the area of the triangle. So I need to compute the area first.

I can use Heron's formula for the area. The semi-perimeter s = (a + b + c)/2 = (5 + 9 + 10)/2 = 24/2 = 12.

Then, the area Δ = sqrt[s(s - a)(s - b)(s - c)] = sqrt[12*(12-9)*(12-10)*(12-5)] = sqrt[12*3*2*7] = sqrt[504].

Wait, 12*3 is 36, 36*2 is 72, 72*7 is 504. So sqrt(504). Let me see if that simplifies. 504 factors: 504 = 16 * 31.5? No, wait, 504 divided by 16 is 31.5, but that's not helpful. Alternatively, 504 = 9 * 56, since 9 * 56 is 504. So sqrt(9*56) = 3*sqrt(56). And 56 is 4*14, so sqrt(56) = 2*sqrt(14). So the area is 3*2*sqrt(14) = 6*sqrt(14).

So Δ = 6√14.

Now, the circumradius R = (a*b*c)/(4Δ) = (5 * 9 * 10)/(4 * 6√14) = (450)/(24√14). Let me simplify that.

450 divided by 24 can be reduced. Both are divisible by 6: 450/6=75, 24/6=4. So R = 75/(4√14). To rationalize the denominator, multiply numerator and denominator by √14: (75√14)/(4*14) = (75√14)/56.

So R = (75√14)/56.

Okay, now, back to point D. Since D is the intersection of the tangents at B and C, it's the ex-pole or something. Also, triangle DBC is an isosceles triangle because DB = DC.

Wait, I think D is the ex-similicenter of the circle with respect to some other circle, but maybe that's complicating things. Alternatively, maybe I can use coordinates to find the position of D.

Alternatively, maybe I can use the fact that BD is tangent to ω at B, so angle OBD is 90 degrees, where O is the center of ω. Similarly, angle OCD is 90 degrees.

Wait, if I can find the coordinates of O, maybe I can find the equation of the tangents at B and C, find their intersection point D, then find the equation of line AD, and then find where it intersects ω again at P, and then compute AP.

That sounds like a plan, though it might involve a lot of computation. Let me try that.

First, let me assign coordinates to triangle ABC. Let me place point C at the origin (0,0). Let me place point A at (10, 0) because AC is 10 units. Then, point B is somewhere in the plane; I need to find its coordinates.

Given AB = 5, BC = 9, AC = 10. So point A is at (10,0), point C is at (0,0). Let point B be at (x,y). Then, the distance from B to C is 9, so sqrt(x² + y²) = 9 => x² + y² = 81.

The distance from A to B is 5, so sqrt((x -10)^2 + y²) = 5 => (x -10)^2 + y² = 25.

Subtract the first equation from the second: (x -10)^2 + y² - (x² + y²) = 25 - 81 => (x² -20x +100) + y² - x² - y² = -56 => -20x + 100 = -56 => -20x = -156 => x = 156/20 = 39/5 = 7.8.

So x = 7.8, which is 39/5. Then, from x² + y² = 81, y² = 81 - (39/5)^2.

Calculate (39/5)^2: 39² = 1521, so (39/5)^2 = 1521/25 = 60.84.

So y² = 81 - 60.84 = 20.16. 20.16 is 2016/100 = 504/25. So y = sqrt(504/25) = sqrt(504)/5.

Simplify sqrt(504). 504 factors: 504 = 16 * 31.5? Wait, 504 = 16 * 31.5? No, wait, 16*31.5 is 504, but 31.5 isn't an integer. Alternatively, 504 = 72 * 7 = 8*9*7, so sqrt(504) = sqrt(8*9*7) = 2*3*sqrt(14) = 6√14. So y = 6√14 /5.

So point B is at (39/5, 6√14/5).

So to recap, point A is at (10,0), point B is at (39/5, 6√14/5), point C is at (0,0).

Next, I need to find the circumcircle ω of triangle ABC. Since I have coordinates for A, B, C, I can find the circumradius and the center O.

Wait, I already calculated the circumradius R as (75√14)/56. But let me verify that.

Alternatively, let's compute the circumcenter O. The circumcenter is the intersection of the perpendicular bisectors of the sides.

Given points A(10,0), B(39/5, 6√14/5), and C(0,0), let me find the perpendicular bisector of AC and of AB, then find their intersection.

Wait, AC is from (10,0) to (0,0), so the midpoint is (5,0). The perpendicular bisector of AC is the line perpendicular to AC at (5,0). Since AC is along the x-axis, its perpendicular bisector is the vertical line x=5.

Now, let me compute the perpendicular bisector of AB.

First, find the midpoint of AB. Point A is at (10,0), point B is at (39/5, 6√14/5). So midpoint M_AB has coordinates ((10 + 39/5)/2, (0 + 6√14/5)/2).

Compute 10 as 50/5, so 50/5 +39/5 = 89/5. Then, divided by 2: 89/10 = 8.9.

Similarly, the y-coordinate is (6√14/5)/2 = 3√14/5.

So the midpoint M_AB is (89/10, 3√14/5).

Now, the slope of AB is (y_B - y_A)/(x_B - x_A) = (6√14/5 - 0)/(39/5 - 10) = (6√14/5)/(39/5 -50/5) = (6√14/5)/(-11/5) = -6√14/11.

So the slope of AB is -6√14/11. Therefore, the slope of the perpendicular bisector is the negative reciprocal, which is 11/(6√14).

Let me rationalize that: 11/(6√14) = (11√14)/(6*14) = (11√14)/84.

So the equation of the perpendicular bisector of AB is (y - 3√14/5) = (11√14/84)(x - 89/10).

Now, since the circumcenter O lies on both perpendicular bisectors, and we already have x=5 as the perpendicular bisector of AC, we can substitute x=5 into the equation of the perpendicular bisector of AB to find y-coordinate.

So substituting x=5:

y - 3√14/5 = (11√14/84)(5 - 89/10).

Compute 5 - 89/10: 5 is 50/10, so 50/10 -89/10 = (-39/10).

So y - 3√14/5 = (11√14/84)*(-39/10) = (-429√14)/(840).

Simplify (-429√14)/840. Let's see: 429 and 840 can both be divided by 3. 429/3=143, 840/3=280. So it becomes (-143√14)/280.

Therefore, y = 3√14/5 + (-143√14)/280.

Convert 3√14/5 to a denominator of 280: 3√14/5 = (3√14 * 56)/280 = 168√14/280.

So y = (168√14 - 143√14)/280 = (25√14)/280 = (5√14)/56.

So the circumcenter O is at (5, 5√14/56).

Wait, that seems a bit low for the y-coordinate, but let's proceed.

Now, the circumradius R can be computed as the distance from O to any of the points A, B, or C. Let's compute OA.

Point O is at (5,5√14/56), point A is at (10,0). So OA distance squared is (10 -5)^2 + (0 -5√14/56)^2 = 25 + (25*14)/(56^2).

Compute 25*14 = 350. 56^2 is 3136. So 350/3136 = 25/224 ≈ 0.1115.

So OA² = 25 + 25/224 = 25*(1 + 1/224) = 25*(225/224) = (5625)/224.

Wait, but earlier, I computed R as (75√14)/56. Let's square that: (75√14 /56)^2 = (5625 *14)/(3136) = (78750)/(3136).

Compute 78750 / 3136: 78750 ÷ 3136 ≈ 25.11.

Wait, but OA² is 5625/224 ≈ 25.11 as well. Let me check:

5625 ÷ 224 ≈ 25.11, yes. So that's correct.

So the circumradius R is indeed (75√14)/56.

Okay, now that I have the coordinates of O, I can find the equations of the tangents at B and C.

The tangent at B: since O is the center, the tangent at B is perpendicular to OB.

The slope of OB is (y_B - y_O)/(x_B - x_O).

Point B is at (39/5,6√14/5), and O is at (5,5√14/56).

Compute x_B - x_O = 39/5 -5 = 39/5 -25/5 =14/5.

Compute y_B - y_O = (6√14/5) - (5√14/56) = (6√14 *56 -5√14 *5)/(5*56) = [336√14 -25√14]/280 = (311√14)/280.

So the slope of OB is (311√14/280) / (14/5) = (311√14/280) * (5/14) = (311√14 *5)/(280*14) = (1555√14)/(3920).

Simplify numerator and denominator: 1555 and 3920.

Let me see if they have a common factor. 1555 ÷5 = 311, 3920 ÷5=784. So 311 and 784. 311 is a prime number, I think. 784 is 28². So the slope is (311√14)/784.

Wait, no. Wait, 1555/3920 = (311*5)/(784*5) = 311/784. So slope of OB is (311√14)/784? Wait, no, wait.

Wait, no, I think I messed up. The slope is (311√14 /280) divided by (14/5). So that's (311√14/280) * (5/14) = (311√14 *5)/(280*14). 280 is 5*56, 14 is 2*7. So 280*14= 3920.

So 311√14 *5= 1555√14, so slope is 1555√14 /3920.

Simplify 1555 and 3920: 1555 is 5*311, 3920 is 5*784. So 1555/3920 = 311/784.

So slope of OB is (311√14)/784.

Therefore, the tangent at B is perpendicular to OB, so its slope is the negative reciprocal.

So the slope of tangent at B is -784/(311√14).

Wait, let me check: the slope of OB is m, then the slope of tangent is -1/m. So m = (311√14)/784, so -1/m is -784/(311√14). Correct.

But that's a bit messy. Maybe I can rationalize the denominator.

Multiply numerator and denominator by √14:

-784√14/(311*14) = -784√14/(4354) = -392√14/2177.

Wait, 784 divided by 2 is 392, 4354 divided by 2 is 2177. So yeah, it's -392√14/2177.

Hmm, that's still messy. Alternatively, maybe I can write it as -784/(311√14) without rationalizing.

Alternatively, maybe I can find the equation of the tangent at B.

The tangent at B passes through B(39/5,6√14/5) and has slope m_tangent = -784/(311√14).

So the equation is y - 6√14/5 = [-784/(311√14)](x -39/5).

Similarly, the tangent at C is easier, as point C is at (0,0). The tangent at C is perpendicular to OC.

The slope of OC is (0 -5√14/56)/(0 -5) = (-5√14/56)/(-5) = (√14)/56.

So the slope of OC is √14/56. Therefore, the tangent at C has slope -56/√14, which simplifies to -56√14/14 = -4√14.

So equation of tangent at C is y = -4√14 x.

So now we have two tangent equations: tangent at B and tangent at C.

Point D is their intersection. So to find D, I can solve the equations of the two tangents.

Equation of tangent at C: y = -4√14 x.

Equation of tangent at B: y -6√14/5 = [-784/(311√14)](x -39/5).

Let me substitute y from tangent C into tangent B's equation.

So:

-4√14 x -6√14/5 = [-784/(311√14)](x -39/5).

Multiply both sides by 311√14 to eliminate denominators:

Left side: (-4√14 x -6√14/5) *311√14.

Right side: -784(x -39/5).

Let me compute each term.

First, expand the left side:

(-4√14 x)(311√14) + (-6√14/5)(311√14).

Compute each term:

-4√14 *311√14 = -4*311*(√14)^2 = -4*311*14.

Similarly, -6√14/5 *311√14 = -6/5 *311*(√14)^2 = -6/5*311*14.

So:

Left side:

-4*311*14 x - (6/5)*311*14

Right side:

-784x + (784*39)/5.

Wait, let me compute each part step by step.

Compute Left Side:

First term: (-4√14 x)(311√14) = (-4*311)*(√14)^2 x = (-1244)*(14)x = -17416x.

Second term: (-6√14/5)(311√14) = (-6*311/5)*(√14)^2 = (-1866/5)*14 = (-1866*14)/5 = -26124/5.

So Left Side: -17416x -26124/5.

Right Side: -784(x -39/5) = -784x + (784*39)/5.

Compute 784*39:

784 * 40 = 31360, subtract 784: 31360 -784 = 30576.

So 784*39 = 30576. So Right Side: -784x + 30576/5.

So, putting it all together:

-17416x -26124/5 = -784x + 30576/5.

Bring all terms to the left:

-17416x +784x -26124/5 -30576/5 = 0.

Compute:

-16632x - (26124 +30576)/5 = 0.

Compute 26124 +30576 = 56700. So:

-16632x -56700/5 = 0.

Simplify 56700/5 = 11340.

So:

-16632x -11340 = 0.

Bring 11340 to the other side:

-16632x = 11340.

Multiply both sides by -1:

16632x = -11340.

So x = -11340 /16632.

Simplify this fraction. Let's see:

Divide numerator and denominator by 12: 11340 ÷12=945, 16632 ÷12=1386.

So x = -945/1386.

Divide numerator and denominator by 3: 945 ÷3=315, 1386 ÷3=462.

Again by 3: 315 ÷3=105, 462 ÷3=154.

So x = -105/154.

Wait, 154 and 105 can both be divided by 7: 105 ÷7=15, 154 ÷7=22. So x= -15/22.

So x = -15/22.

Now, substitute x into the tangent at C equation: y = -4√14 x = -4√14*(-15/22) = (60√14)/22 = (30√14)/11.

So point D is at (-15/22, 30√14/11).

Now, I have point D. Next, I need to find the equation of line AD, which connects points A(10,0) and D(-15/22, 30√14/11).

Compute the slope of AD:

m_AD = (y_D - y_A)/(x_D -x_A) = (30√14/11 -0)/( -15/22 -10) = (30√14/11)/( -15/22 -220/22) = (30√14/11)/( -235/22).

Simplify:

(30√14/11) * (22/-235) = (30√14 *22)/(11*(-235)).

Simplify 22/11=2, and 30/235: 30 and 235 can both be divided by 5: 30/5=6, 235/5=47.

So:

(30√14 *2)/( -47 ) = (60√14)/(-47) = -60√14/47.

So the slope m_AD is -60√14/47.

Now, the equation of line AD is y -0 = m_AD (x -10).

So y = (-60√14/47)(x -10).

Now, I need to find the point P where AD intersects ω again. Point A is already on ω, so P is the other intersection point.

Equation of ω: since the circumcircle passes through A(10,0), B(39/5,6√14/5), C(0,0), and center O(5,5√14/56).

So the equation is (x -5)^2 + (y -5√14/56)^2 = R^2, where R^2 is (75√14/56)^2 = (5625*14)/3136.

Compute R^2: 5625*14=78750, so 78750/3136.

So the circle equation is:

(x -5)^2 + (y -5√14/56)^2 = 78750/3136.

Now, substitute y from line AD into the circle equation.

So let me write y = (-60√14/47)(x -10).

Let me denote y = m(x -10), where m = -60√14/47.

So substitute into the circle equation:

(x -5)^2 + (m(x -10) -5√14/56)^2 = 78750/3136.

That looks a bit complicated, but let's expand it step by step.

First, expand (x -5)^2: x² -10x +25.

Second, compute m(x-10) -5√14/56.

Compute each term:

m(x-10) = (-60√14/47)(x -10) = (-60√14 x)/47 + 600√14/47.

Then subtract 5√14/56: (-60√14 x)/47 + 600√14/47 -5√14/56.

So the second term is [ (-60√14 x)/47 + (600√14/47 -5√14/56) ].

Let me combine the constants:

600√14/47 -5√14/56.

Factor out √14:

√14*(600/47 -5/56).

Compute 600/47 ≈12.7659, 5/56≈0.089286.

But to compute exactly, find a common denominator for 47 and 56, which is 47*56=2632.

So 600/47 = (600*56)/2632 = 33600/2632.

5/56 = (5*47)/2632 = 235/2632.

So 600/47 -5/56 = (33600 -235)/2632 = 33365/2632.

Simplify 33365 and 2632: Let's see if they have common factors.

33365 ÷5=6673, 2632 ÷5=526.4, not integer. So 33365/2632 is in simplest form.

So the second term becomes:

(-60√14 x)/47 + √14*(33365/2632).

Now, square that term.

This is getting really messy. Maybe there's a smarter way.

Alternatively, since I know that line AD passes through A(10,0) and D(-15/22,30√14/11), and intersects ω again at P, which is different from A. So, perhaps I can parametrize AD and find its second intersection with ω.

Let me parametrize AD with parameter t.

Let me set t=0 at A(10,0), and t=1 at D(-15/22,30√14/11).

So the parametric equations are:

x(t) = 10 + t*( (-15/22) -10 ) = 10 + t*(-235/22).

y(t) = 0 + t*(30√14/11 -0 ) = t*(30√14/11).

So x(t) =10 - (235/22) t.

y(t)= (30√14/11) t.

We can substitute these into the circle equation to find t when the point is on ω.

So, plug into (x(t) -5)^2 + (y(t) -5√14/56)^2 = 78750/3136.

Compute x(t) -5 = (10 -5) - (235/22) t =5 - (235/22) t.

y(t) -5√14/56 = (30√14/11)t -5√14/56.

So, compute each squared term:

First term: [5 - (235/22)t]^2.

Second term: [ (30√14/11)t -5√14/56 ]^2.

Sum equals 78750/3136.

Let me compute each part.

Compute [5 - (235/22)t]^2 =25 - 2*5*(235/22)t + (235/22)^2 t².

=25 - (2350/22)t + (55225/484)t².

Simplify fractions:

2350/22 =1175/11.

55225/484 remains as is.

Second term: [ (30√14/11)t -5√14/56 ]^2.

Factor out √14:

√14 [ (30/11)t -5/56 ].

So squared: 14 [ (30/11 t -5/56 ) ]^2.

Compute inside:

(30/11 t -5/56 )^2 = (30/11)^2 t² - 2*(30/11)*(5/56) t + (5/56)^2.

Compute each term:

(30/11)^2 =900/121.

2*(30/11)*(5/56)= (60/11)*(5/56)= (300)/(616)=75/154.

(5/56)^2=25/3136.

So expanding:

=900/121 t² - 75/154 t +25/3136.

Multiply by 14:

=14*(900/121 t²) -14*(75/154 t) +14*(25/3136).

Compute each term:

14*(900/121) = 12600/121.

14*(75/154) = (14*75)/154 = 1050/154 = 525/77.

14*(25/3136) = 350/3136 = 25/224.

So the second term becomes:

12600/121 t² -525/77 t +25/224.

Now, sum the first and second terms:

First term:25 - (1175/11)t + (55225/484)t².

Second term:12600/121 t² -525/77 t +25/224.

So total equation:

25 - (1175/11)t + (55225/484)t² +12600/121 t² -525/77 t +25/224 = 78750/3136.

Combine like terms.

Let me compute the coefficients for t², t, and constants.

t² terms:

55225/484 +12600/121.

Convert 12600/121 to 484 denominator: 121*4=484, so 12600/121 =12600*4/484=50400/484.

So t² coefficients:55225 +50400 =105625 → 105625/484.

t terms:

-1175/11 -525/77.

Convert to common denominator, which is 77.

-1175/11 = -1175*7/77= -8225/77.

-525/77 remains as is.

So t terms: (-8225 -525)/77 = (-8750)/77.

Constants:

25 +25/224.

Convert 25 to 5600/224, so 5600/224 +25/224=5625/224.

So the equation is:

(105625/484) t² - (8750/77) t +5625/224 =78750/3136.

Bring the right-hand side to the left:

(105625/484) t² - (8750/77) t +5625/224 -78750/3136 =0.

Compute 5625/224 -78750/3136.

Convert to common denominator, 3136.

5625/224 = (5625*14)/3136 =78750/3136.

So 78750/3136 -78750/3136=0.

Wait, that's interesting. So the constants cancel out.

So equation becomes:

(105625/484) t² - (8750/77) t =0.

Factor out t:

t [ (105625/484) t -8750/77 ] =0.

So solutions are t=0, which corresponds to point A, and the other solution is when:

(105625/484) t -8750/77=0.

Solving for t:

(105625/484) t =8750/77.

Multiply both sides by 484/105625:

t= (8750/77) * (484/105625).

Simplify fractions:

First, 8750 and 77: 77=7*11, 8750=875*10=125*7*10.

So 8750/77 = (125*7*10)/(7*11)= (1250)/11.

Similarly, 484=22²=4*121=4*11².

105625=105625. Let me see: 105625 ÷25=4225, which is 65². So 105625=25*65²=25*(5*13)^2=25*25*169=625*169.

Alternatively, perhaps 105625= (325)^2, since 325^2=105625.

Wait, 300^2=90000, 325^2= (300+25)^2=90000 + 15000 +625=105625. Yes, correct.

So 105625=325².

So t= (1250/11) * (484/325²).

Compute 484=22², 325=5²*13.

So:

t= (1250/11)*(22²)/(325²)= (1250/11)*(484)/(105625).

Now, 484=4*121=4*11².

So t= (1250/11)*(4*11²)/(105625).

Simplify:

1250/11 * (4*121)/105625.

Note that 121=11², so 4*121=4*121.

105625=325²= (5²*13)^2=5^4*13².

But perhaps simplifying the fractions:

First, 1250 and 105625.

1250 ÷25=50, 105625 ÷25=4225.

So 1250/105625=50/4225.

50 and 4225 can both be divided by 25:50/25=2, 4225/25=169.

So 50/4225=2/169.

Similarly, 4*11²=4*121=484.

And 11 in the denominator from 1250/11.

So putting it together:

t= (2/169)*(484)/(11) = (2 *484)/(169*11).

Compute 484 ÷11=44.

So t= (2*44)/(169)=88/169.

So t=88/169.

Therefore, the parameter value for P is t=88/169.

Now, compute the coordinates of P using the parametric equations.

x(t) =10 - (235/22)*t =10 - (235/22)*(88/169).

Compute (235/22)*(88/169):

235 and 22: 22=2*11, 235=5*47. No common factors.

88=8*11, 169=13².

So (235/22)*(88/169)= (235*88)/(22*169).

Simplify 88/22=4, so 235*4=940.

So 940 /169.

Therefore, x(t)=10 -940/169.

Convert 10 to 1690/169, so x(t)=1690/169 -940/169=750/169.

Similarly, y(t)= (30√14/11)*t= (30√14/11)*(88/169)= (30√14 *8)/(169)=240√14/169.

So point P is at (750/169, 240√14/169).

Now, I need to find the distance AP. Point A is at (10,0), point P is at (750/169,240√14/169).

Compute the distance between them.

AP²= (750/169 -10)^2 + (240√14/169 -0)^2.

Compute 750/169 -10: 10=1690/169, so 750-1690= -940. So -940/169.

So AP²= (-940/169)^2 + (240√14/169)^2.

Compute each term:

(-940/169)^2= (940^2)/(169^2).

(240√14/169)^2= (240^2 *14)/(169^2).

Compute 940^2: 940*940. Let me compute 94^2=8836, so 940^2=883600.

240^2=57600, so 57600*14=806400.

So AP²= (883600 +806400)/(169^2).

Sum numerator: 883600+806400=1,690,000.

So AP²=1,690,000/(169^2).

169=13², so 169²=28561.

So AP²=1,690,000 /28561.

Simplify this fraction.

Let me see if 1,690,000 and 28561 have common factors.

28561 is 13^4. Let's check if 13 divides 1,690,000.

1,690,000 ÷13=130,000. Because 13*130,000=1,690,000.

So 1,690,000=13*130,000, and 28561=13^4.

So AP²= (13*130,000)/(13^4)=130,000/(13^3).

13^3=2197.

So AP²=130000/2197.

Simplify 130000/2197. Let me see if 2197 divides into 130000.

130000 ÷2197: let's compute 2197*59=?

2197*50=109,850.

2197*9=19,773.

So 109,850+19,773=129,623.

Subtract from 130,000: 130,000-129,623=377.

So 2197*59 +377=130,000.

But 377 is 2197/5.85, which is not an integer. So perhaps 130,000 and 2197 can be simplified.

Wait, 130,000=13*10,000, 2197=13^3.

So 130,000/2197= (13*10,000)/(13^3)=10,000/(13²)=10,000/169.

Wait, that's incorrect because 130,000/2197= (13*10,000)/(13^3)=10,000/(13^2)=10,000/169.

Wait, 10,000/169 is approximately 59.1716.

Wait, let me compute 10,000 ÷169.

169*59=169*(50+9)=8450+1521=9971.

10,000 -9971=29.

So 10,000=169*59 +29.

So 10,000/169=59 +29/169.

Wait, but that's not helpful. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake earlier.

Wait, AP²=1,690,000/(169^2)= (1690^2)/(169^2)= (1690/169)^2=10^2=100.

Wait, wait, hold on. 1,690,000 is (169*10)^2=169² *100.

So 1,690,000/(169²)=100.

Wait, that's much simpler. So AP²=100, so AP=10.

But that's confusing because AC is 10. But point P is different from point C, right?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, let me re-examine.

AP²= (750/169 -10)^2 + (240√14/169)^2.

Compute 750/169 -10= (750 -1690)/169= (-940)/169.

So squared: (940^2)/(169^2).

Similarly, (240√14/169)^2= (240^2 *14)/(169^2).

So AP²= [940² +240² *14]/169².

Compute numerator:

940²= (900 +40)^2=900² +2*900*40 +40²=810000 +72000 +1600= 810000+72000=882000 +1600=883600.

240²=57600, 57600*14=806400.

Sum:883600 +806400=1,690,000.

So AP²=1,690,000/(169²)=1,690,000/(28561).

But 1,690,000=169 *10,000.

So 169*10,000 / (169²)=10,000/169.

So AP²=10,000/169.

So AP=100/13.

Because sqrt(10,000/169)=100/13.

So AP=100/13.

So m=100, n=13, which are coprime.

Thus, m +n=113.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To solve the problem, we start by noting that triangle \(ABC\) is inscribed in circle \(\omega\), and the tangents at \(B\) and \(C\) intersect at point \(D\). The line \(AD\) intersects \(\omega\) again at \(P\). We are given \(AB = 5\), \(BC = 9\), and \(AC = 10\), and we need to find \(AP\).

First, we calculate the circumradius \(R\) of triangle \(ABC\). Using Heron's formula, the semi-perimeter \(s\) is \(12\), and the area \(\Delta\) is \(6\sqrt{14}\). The circumradius \(R\) is found to be \(\frac{75\sqrt{14}}{56}\).

Next, we determine the coordinates of points \(A\), \(B\), and \(C\) by placing \(C\) at the origin \((0,0)\), \(A\) at \((10,0)\), and calculating \(B\) as \((\frac{39}{5}, \frac{6\sqrt{14}}{5})\). The circumcenter \(O\) is found to be at \((5, \frac{5\sqrt{14}}{56})\).

We then find the equations of the tangents at \(B\) and \(C\). The tangent at \(C\) has a slope of \(-4\sqrt{14}\), giving the equation \(y = -4\sqrt{14}x\). The tangent at \(B\) is calculated to have a slope of \(-\frac{392\sqrt{14}}{2177}\), leading to the equation \(y - \frac{6\sqrt{14}}{5} = -\frac{392\sqrt{14}}{2177}(x - \frac{39}{5})\).

Solving these equations, we find point \(D\) at \((-\\frac{15}{22}, \frac{30\sqrt{14}}{11})\). The equation of line \(AD\) is determined to have a slope of \(-\frac{60\sqrt{14}}{47}\), giving the equation \(y = -\frac{60\sqrt{14}}{47}(x - 10)\).

To find point \(P\), we parametrize line \(AD\) and substitute into the circle equation. Solving, we find \(t = \frac{88}{169}\), leading to the coordinates of \(P\) as \((\frac{750}{169}, \frac{240\sqrt{14}}{169})\).

Finally, calculating the distance \(AP\), we find \(AP = \frac{100}{13}\). Thus, \(m = 100\) and \(n = 13\), giving \(m + n = 113\).

\(\boxed{113}\)
