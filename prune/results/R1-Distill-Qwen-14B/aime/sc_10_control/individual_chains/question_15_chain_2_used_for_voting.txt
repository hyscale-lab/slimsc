Okay, so I have this problem about counting the number of paths on an 8x8 grid. The paths are from the lower left corner to the upper right corner, and they have a length of 16. I need to find how many such paths change direction exactly four times. Hmm, let me try to break this down.

First, I know that on an 8x8 grid, moving from the lower left to the upper right requires moving 8 steps to the right and 8 steps up, in some order. So the total number of paths without any restrictions is the combination of 16 steps taken 8 at a time, which is C(16,8). But wait, the problem isn't just about any paths—it's specifically about paths that change direction exactly four times.

Changing direction exactly four times... Hmm. Let me think about what that means. Each time the path changes direction, it switches from moving right to up or up to right. So, for example, if I start moving right, then change direction to up, that's one change. Then if I change again back to right, that's a second change, and so on.

So, if a path changes direction exactly four times, how does that break down? Well, each direction change alternates between right and up. So, starting from right, the sequence of moves would be right, up, right, up, etc., or starting from up, up, right, up, right, etc. But in our case, since we start at the lower left, the first move is either right or up. Wait, no, actually, in a grid path, you can choose any direction first, but for the most straightforward case, perhaps starting with right or up. Hmm, maybe I should consider both cases separately.

Wait, no. Wait, in a grid, the path can start with either a right or an up move. But in our case, since we have to reach the upper right corner, if the first move is right, then at some point we have to switch to up, and vice versa.

But the number of direction changes is four. So, let me think about how many runs of right and up moves there are. Each direction change corresponds to a new "run" of steps in that direction.

If a path changes direction four times, that means there are five runs in total. Because each direction change adds a new run. So, starting direction is either right or up.

Case 1: The path starts with a right move. Then, the number of runs would be right, up, right, up, etc. Since it changes direction four times, the number of runs is five. So, starting with right, it will have right, up, right, up, right. So, five runs: three right runs and two up runs? Or, wait, no, starting with right, with four direction changes, how many runs of each direction?

Wait, let me think more carefully.

Each direction change is a switch between right and up. So, if I have four direction changes, that means the path alternates direction four times. So, starting from right, the sequence would be right, up, right, up, right. That's five runs. So, three right runs and two up runs. Similarly, starting from up, it would be up, right, up, right, up. So, three up runs and two right runs.

So, in either case, the number of runs is five, with three runs in the starting direction and two in the other direction.

Wait, but the starting direction can be either right or up. So, I need to consider both possibilities.

So, for the starting direction right: 3 right runs and 2 up runs.

For the starting direction up: 3 up runs and 2 right runs.

So, each case would have a different number of runs, but the total number of runs is five in each case.

But wait, how does that affect the number of direction changes? Because each time, the direction changes, so four direction changes would lead to five runs. So, yes, that makes sense.

Now, the key idea is that in each case, we have a certain number of runs in each direction. So, for each possible starting direction, we can model the problem as partitioning the steps into runs.

So, the problem reduces to: how many ways can we arrange the 8 right steps into 3 runs, and the 8 up steps into 2 runs (if starting with right), or vice versa.

So, let's formalize this.

If starting with right:

- The number of right runs is 3, and each right run has at least 1 step.

- Similarly, the number of up runs is 2, each with at least 1 step.

Similarly, if starting with up:

- The number of up runs is 3, each with at least 1 step.

- The number of right runs is 2, each with at least 1 step.

So, the problem becomes, for each case, compute the number of ways to distribute the steps into the respective runs, and then sum over both cases.

So, for starting with right:

We have 8 right steps to distribute into 3 runs, each run at least 1. The number of ways to do this is C(8-1,3-1) = C(7,2) = 21.

Similarly, for the up steps: 8 up steps into 2 runs, each at least 1. So, C(8-1,2-1)=C(7,1)=7.

So, for starting with right, the number of paths is 21*7=147.

Similarly, for starting with up:

8 up steps into 3 runs: C(7,2)=21.

8 right steps into 2 runs: C(7,1)=7.

So, the number of paths starting with up is 21*7=147.

Therefore, the total number of paths changing direction exactly four times is 147 + 147 = 294.

Wait, but hold on. Let me verify that because sometimes when you model it this way, you might have counted something twice or missed constraints.

Alternatively, perhaps I should think of the number of runs as being 5, with either 3 right and 2 up or 3 up and 2 right.

Wait, but in either case, the number of ways for each is the same, so it's symmetric. So, perhaps I can model it as 2 * [C(7,2) * C(7,1)].

Wait, no, because for each starting direction, the number is 147, and since starting direction can be either right or up, it's 2*147=294.

Wait, but another way to think about this is that the number of runs is five, either three right and two up or three up and two right.

So, the total number of paths is:

Number of ways when starting with right: C(7,2) * C(7,1) = 21*7=147

Number of ways when starting with up: C(7,2) * C(7,1)=21*7=147

Total: 147*2=294.

So, the answer is 294.

But wait, hold on, let me see if that reasoning is correct.

Each time, when starting with right, it's 3 runs of right and 2 runs of up. So, for right steps, the number of compositions is C(8-1,3-1)=C(7,2)=21, and for up steps, C(8-1,2-1)=C(7,1)=7. So, 21*7=147.

Similarly, when starting with up, it's 3 runs of up and 2 runs of right, so same calculation.

So, 294 in total.

But wait another thing: do these runs have to be in order? Like, starting with right, the runs are right, up, right, up, right. So, the runs alternate.

Similarly, starting with up, it's up, right, up, right, up.

So, yes, the order is fixed once you choose the starting direction.

So, the number of ways is the product of the compositions for each direction.

Therefore, 294 seems correct.

But let me think of another way. The total number of direction changes is four, so the number of runs is five.

Each run is either right or up, and the runs alternate.

So, the number of runs starting with right is five runs, with 3 right and 2 up.

Similarly, starting with up, 3 up and 2 right.

So, in each case, the number of compositions is same: for 3 runs of one direction, it's C(8-1,3-1)=21, and for 2 runs of the other, C(7,1)=7.

So, 21*7*2=294.

So, yeah, I think that's the answer.

Wait, but wait another thought. The problem says "change direction exactly four times". So, the path could start with any direction, but after that, it alternates. So, the number of direction changes is four, which implies five runs, as each direction change adds a new run.

So, yeah, for both starting directions, we have 147 each, so 294. So, I think that's correct.

Therefore, the answer is 294.

To solve the problem, we need to count the number of paths from the lower left corner to the upper right corner of an 8×8 grid that change direction exactly four times. 

A path changing direction exactly four times means it has five runs (consecutive steps in the same direction). These runs alternate between right and up. For example, starting with a right move, the sequence would be right, up, right, up, right, resulting in three right runs and two up runs. Similarly, starting with an up move would result in three up runs and two right runs.

For each starting direction:
1. If starting with right:
   - Distribute 8 right steps into 3 runs: \( \binom{7}{2} = 21 \) ways.
   - Distribute 8 up steps into 2 runs: \( \binom{7}{1} = 7 \) ways.
   - Total paths starting with right: \( 21 \times 7 = 147 \).

2. If starting with up:
   - Distribute 8 up steps into 3 runs: \( \binom{7}{2} = 21 \) ways.
   - Distribute 8 right steps into 2 runs: \( \binom{7}{1} = 7 \) ways.
   - Total paths starting with up: \( 21 \times 7 = 147 \).

Summing both cases, the total number of paths is \( 147 + 147 = 294 \).

Thus, the number of such paths is:

\boxed{294}
