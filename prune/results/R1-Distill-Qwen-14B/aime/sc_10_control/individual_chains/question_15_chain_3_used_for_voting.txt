Okay, so I have this problem about counting the number of paths on an 8x8 grid. The paths start from the lower left corner and go to the upper right corner, with a total length of 16 steps. Each step must be either right or up, I assume. The condition is that the path changes direction exactly four times. Hmm, okay.

Let me think about grids and paths. I remember that in an 8x8 grid, moving from the bottom-left to the top-right requires moving 8 steps to the right and 8 steps up, in some order. So, the total number of steps is 16, right? That makes sense because 8+8=16. So, each path is a sequence of 8 rights (R) and 8 ups (U), arranged in some order.

Now, the number of such paths without any restrictions is the combination of 16 steps taken 8 at a time, which is C(16,8). But the problem here is that we need to count only those paths that change direction exactly four times.

Wait, what does changing direction mean? In a grid path, a direction change occurs when you switch from moving right to up or from up to right. So, for example, if you have a path like RRRUUURRUU, each time you switch from R to U or U to R, that's a direction change.

Let me think about how direction changes relate to the number of runs. A run is a consecutive sequence of the same direction. So, for example, RRR is a run of length 3, and UUU is another run. Each time the direction changes, a new run starts.

So, the number of direction changes is equal to the number of runs minus one. Because each run after the first starts with a direction change. For example, if there are 5 runs, there are 4 direction changes.

Wait, let me confirm. If a path has k runs, then the number of direction changes is k-1. So, if I want exactly four direction changes, that means the path has 5 runs.

So, the problem reduces to counting the number of paths with exactly 5 runs. Each run alternates between R and U, starting with either R or U.

So, the first run could be R or U. Then the next run is the other direction, and so on, alternating each time. Since we have 5 runs, the starting direction can be R or U, but we need to make sure that the total number of R steps is 8 and U steps is 8.

Let me formalize that. Let's consider two cases:

Case 1: The path starts with R and has 5 runs. Since it starts with R, the runs alternate R, U, R, U, R. Wait, no, 5 runs starting with R would go R, U, R, U, R. That's 5 runs. Similarly, if it starts with U, the runs would be U, R, U, R, U.

Wait, but 5 runs would mean that the number of runs R and U could differ by at most one. Let me see. If starting with R, then the number of R runs would be 3 and U runs would be 2. Because R is first, then U, R, U, R. That's 3 R runs and 2 U runs. Similarly, starting with U would lead to 3 U runs and 2 R runs.

But in our problem, we have an equal number of R and U steps: 8 each. So, we need to distribute 8 R's into the R runs and 8 U's into the U runs.

Let's think about the runs. For example, in Case 1, starting with R, we have 3 R runs and 2 U runs. The total number of R steps is 8, so we need to distribute 8 R's into 3 runs. Each run must have at least 1 step because you can't have a run of zero. Similarly for U steps: 8 U's into 2 runs, each run at least 1 step.

So, this becomes a stars and bars problem. The number of ways to distribute n indistinct items into k distinct boxes with each box having at least one item is C(n-1, k-1). So, for R's: C(8-1,3-1) = C(7,2). Similarly, for U's: C(8-1,2-1) = C(7,1).

But wait, we have to multiply these because the distributions are independent. So, for starting with R, the number of paths is C(7,2) * C(7,1).

Similarly, for Case 2, starting with U: 3 U runs and 2 R runs. So, the number of ways is C(7,2) * C(7,1), same as Case 1.

Therefore, the total number of paths with exactly 5 runs (so 4 direction changes) is 2 * [C(7,2) * C(7,1)].

Wait, let me check. C(7,2) is 21, C(7,1) is 7. So 21*7=147, and then multiplied by 2 gives 294. But is that correct?

Wait, let me make sure I've considered everything correctly. So, we have two cases: starting with R or starting with U.

In each case, the number of runs is 5, which is an odd number. So, starting with R will have (ceil(5/2)) R runs, which is 3, and (floor(5/2)) U runs, which is 2. Similarly, starting with U will have 3 U runs and 2 R runs.

Yes, that's correct.

So, for each case, the number of ways is C(7,2) * C(7,1). Let me see why. For R runs: We have 8 R's to distribute into 3 runs, each run at least 1. So, 8-3=5, and we need to place 2 dividers, so C(5+2-1,2-1)=C(6,1)=6. Wait, wait, wait. Wait, no, maybe I'm mixing up.

Wait, no, stars and bars says that the number of ways to distribute n identical items into k boxes with each box at least one is C(n-1, k-1). So, for 8 R's into 3 runs: C(8-1,3-1)=C(7,2)=21. Similarly, 8 U's into 2 runs: C(8-1,2-1)=C(7,1)=7. So, yes, 21 *7=147 per starting direction.

So, 147 for starting with R, 147 for starting with U. Total of 294.

Wait, but the grid is 8x8, so moving from (0,0) to (8,8). So, the number of steps is 8 right and 8 up. So, yes, 8 R's and 8 U's.

Wait, but if I start with R, the number of R runs is 3, each run has at least 1 R. So, 8 R's into 3 runs: 8 = r1 + r2 + r3, where each ri >=1. The number of solutions is C(8-1,3-1)=C(7,2)=21. Similarly for U's: 8 U's into 2 runs: C(7,1)=7. So, 21*7=147. Same for starting with U.

So, 147*2=294.

Wait, but let me think again about direction changes. Each run alternates direction, so starting with R means the runs are R, U, R, U, R. So, 3 R runs and 2 U runs.

Wait, but the total number of direction changes is 4, right? Because each time you switch direction, that's a change. So, 5 runs mean 4 changes. So, yes, correct.

Alternatively, another way to think about it is that the number of direction changes is one less than the number of runs, so 5 runs =>4 changes.

So, seems like 294 is the answer.

Wait, but let me check with another approach to make sure.

Another approach: The number of paths with exactly k direction changes is equal to 2 * C(n-1, k/2) * C(m-1, k/2) when k is even, but wait, that might not apply here. Alternatively, perhaps using generating functions or recursive methods.

Wait, but maybe I can think in terms of the number of runs. So, in general, the number of lattice paths from (0,0) to (m,n) with exactly r runs is given by... Hmm, I'm not sure if I remember the exact formula, but perhaps I can derive it.

The number of runs is equal to the number of times the direction changes plus one. So, for r runs, there are r-1 direction changes.

Each run alternates between R and U. So, if the path starts with R, the number of R runs is ceil(r/2), and U runs is floor(r/2). Similarly, if it starts with U, it's the opposite.

In our case, r=5 runs.

So, starting with R: 3 R runs and 2 U runs. Starting with U: 3 U runs and 2 R runs.

So, for starting with R, the number of paths is C(8-1,3-1) * C(8-1,2-1) = C(7,2) * C(7,1) = 21*7=147.

Same for starting with U: 147.

So, total is 294.

Yes, that matches my earlier calculation. So, I think 294 is correct.

Wait, but let me think if there's any other constraint or consideration I might have missed.

For example, the grid is 8x8, but the number of steps is 16, which is correct because 8 right and 8 up.

Each run must consist of at least one step, so the distributions are correct with the stars and bars.

Wait, but another thought: is there a problem with having too many runs? For instance, is 5 runs possible on an 8x8 grid?

Well, the maximum number of runs is 16, if you alternate every step. But since we're dealing with 8 R and 8 U steps, the maximum number of runs is 16, but that's not relevant here. 5 runs is definitely possible.

Wait, let me think about an example. Let's take a smaller grid, say 2x2 grid. How many paths with exactly 3 runs?

In a 2x2 grid, the total steps are 4: 2 R and 2 U. The number of direction changes is 3. So, the number of runs is 4.

Wait, how? Wait, no, if you have 3 direction changes, you have 4 runs.

Wait, no, if you have 3 direction changes, the runs are 4. So, for a 2x2 grid, the number of paths with 3 direction changes would be starting with R and having 2 R runs and 2 U runs, or starting with U and having 2 U runs and 2 R runs.

Wait, but 2 R runs and 2 U runs would require distributing 2 R's into 2 runs: C(1,1)=1 way, and same for U's. So, each starting direction gives 1*1=1, so total 2.

But in reality, in a 2x2 grid, the number of paths with exactly 3 direction changes is 2. Let me list them:

R, U, R, U

and

U, R, U, R

Yes, that's it. So, 2 paths, which matches our calculation. So, 2 = 2*(C(1,1)*C(1,1))=2*(1*1)=2.

So, that seems to check out.

Similarly, in our original problem, 294 seems correct.

Wait, but let me also think about another small grid to verify.

Take a 1x1 grid, from (0,0) to (1,1). So, 2 steps: R then U, or U then R. Each path has exactly one direction change. So, how many runs? 2 runs. So, the number of direction changes is 1, which is correct.

Using our formula, for a 1x1 grid, if we want 1 direction change (so 2 runs), let's see.

Number of paths starting with R: 1 run of R (1 step) and 1 run of U (1 step). So, C(0,0)*C(0,0)=1*1=1.

Same for starting with U: 1. So, total 2, which matches.

So, the formula works in that case.

Another test case: 3x3 grid. Let's say we want paths with exactly 4 direction changes, which would mean 5 runs.

Wait, no, 4 direction changes would mean 5 runs. So, starting with R: 3 R runs and 2 U runs. Or starting with U: 3 U runs and 2 R runs.

The number of such paths would be 2*C(2,2)*C(2,1) = 2*(1 * 2 )=4.

Wait, let me check by enumerating.

Wait, in a 3x3 grid, number of paths with exactly 4 direction changes.

Each path must have 5 runs. Starting with R: R, U, R, U, R.

Each R run must have at least 1 step, and U runs as well.

So, for R runs: 3 runs, 3 R's. So, each run must be exactly 1 step. So, no choice there.

Similarly, U runs: 2 runs, 3 U's. So, distributing 3 U's into 2 runs, each at least 1. So, number of ways is C(3-1,2-1)=C(2,1)=2.

So, for starting with R: 1 way for R's, 2 ways for U's. So, 2 paths.

Similarly, starting with U: 2 paths.

Total of 4 paths. Let me see what those paths are:

Starting with R:
1. R, U, R, U, R, U, R, U, R (Wait, no, wait. Let's see:

Wait, 3 R's and 3 U's, arranged as R, U, R, U, R, U. Wait, that's 6 steps, but in a 3x3 grid, it's 6 steps (3 R and 3 U). So, a path with 5 runs would be R, U, R, U, R, U, R. Wait, that's 7 steps. Hmm, wait, maybe I confused the count.

Wait, no, in a 3x3 grid, you need 3 R and 3 U steps, so 6 steps in total. So, 5 runs would mean that the path alternates R and U five times, which would require 5 runs. Let's see:

For example:

1. R, U, R, U, R, U (but that's 6 steps, 3 R and 3 U, and 5 runs. Wait, no, that's 3 R and 3 U, but the number of runs is 6? No, each run is one step. So, 6 runs, each of length 1. So, direction changes 5 times.

Wait, I'm getting confused. Let's think again.

Wait, in a 3x3 grid, a path with 4 direction changes has 5 runs. Each run is a consecutive sequence of R or U. So, for starting with R, the runs would be R, U, R, U, R. That's 3 R runs and 2 U runs.

So, the path would be R, U, R, U, R. But that's 5 runs, but how many steps? Each run must have at least 1 step. So, 3 R runs: total R steps =3. 2 U runs: total U steps=3.

So, the path would be R, U, R, U, R, but that's 5 runs and 5 steps, but we need 6 steps. So, perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, no. Wait, in a 3x3 grid, you need 3 R and 3 U steps, so 6 steps. So, a path with 5 runs must have 5 runs with the steps distributed as such.

Wait, for starting with R, 3 R runs and 2 U runs.

Each R run has at least 1 step, so 3 R runs, total R steps =3. Each U run has at least 1 step, 2 U runs, total U steps=3. So, the path would be:

R (1), U (1), R (1), U (1), R (1). That's 5 runs, 5 steps, but we need 6 steps. Wait, that's a contradiction.

Wait, that means that perhaps such a path isn't possible? Or maybe my initial assumption is wrong.

Wait, no, 3 R runs and 2 U runs. So, in terms of steps, it's R, U, R, U, R. That's 5 runs, but only 5 steps, but in reality, the path needs 6 steps. So, I must have made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, perhaps the number of runs is 5, but the steps are 6. So, one of the runs has two steps. For example, R (2), U (1), R (1), U (1), R (1). That adds up to 6 steps: 2+1+1+1+1.

So, the number of such paths is the number of ways to distribute the additional steps. So, in this case, we have 3 R runs and 2 U runs.

Total R steps: 3, distributed into 3 runs: each run has at least 1. So, the extra R steps (3-3=0) can't be distributed. Wait, no, that can't be.

Wait, perhaps in the 3x3 grid, it's impossible to have 5 runs because 5 runs would require 5 steps, but you need 6 steps.

So, in that case, maybe the formula gives 4, but in reality, it's impossible. Hmm, that's a problem.

Wait, so perhaps my formula isn't correct because in some cases, it's impossible to have the required number of runs. So, maybe I have to add a condition that the number of runs must be such that the sum of runs is equal to the total steps.

Wait, but in the 3x3 grid, 3 R and 3 U, total steps 6. So, number of runs can be up to 6 (alternating every step). So, for 5 runs, it's possible, but requires that one run has two steps and the rest have one step.

So, the number of such paths would be:

For starting with R: 3 R runs and 2 U runs. So, the number of ways to distribute the R steps: 3 steps into 3 runs, each run at least 1: only 1 way, since 1+1+1=3. For U steps: 3 steps into 2 runs, each run at least 1: C(3-1,2-1)=C(2,1)=2 ways.

So, for starting with R, it's 1 * 2 = 2.

Similarly, starting with U: 2 * 1 =2.

So, total of 4 paths.

But when I tried to list them earlier, I was confused because I thought that 5 runs would require 5 steps, but actually, it's about how the runs are distributed.

Wait, so in the 3x3 grid, the number of paths with exactly 5 runs (i.e., 4 direction changes) is 4, which matches our formula. So, that seems correct.

So, perhaps my initial confusion was due to miscounting the runs, but the formula works.

So, returning to the original problem: 8x8 grid, 16 steps, 8 R and 8 U.

We need paths with exactly 4 direction changes, which implies 5 runs.

So, starting with R: 3 R runs, 2 U runs.

Number of ways: C(7,2) * C(7,1) = 21 *7=147.

Same for starting with U: 147.

Total: 294.

Thus, the answer is 294.

I think that's solid. I've checked with smaller grids, the formula works, so I'm confident.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To solve the problem of finding the number of paths on an 8x8 grid from the lower left corner to the upper right corner that change direction exactly four times, we can break down the problem as follows:

1. **Understanding Direction Changes and Runs**:  
   Each path consists of 8 right (R) steps and 8 up (U) steps, totaling 16 steps. A direction change occurs when switching from R to U or U to R. If a path changes direction exactly four times, it has **5 runs** (a run is a consecutive sequence of the same direction).

2. **Case Analysis**:  
   - **Case 1**: The path starts with R. This results in 3 R runs and 2 U runs.  
   - **Case 2**: The path starts with U. This results in 3 U runs and 2 R runs.  

3. **Counting Paths Using Combinations**:  
   For each case, we distribute the steps into runs using the stars and bars method:
   - **For R runs**: Distributing 8 R steps into 3 runs, each with at least 1 step: \( \binom{7}{2} = 21 \).  
   - **For U runs**: Distributing 8 U steps into 2 runs, each with at least 1 step: \( \binom{7}{1} = 7 \).  
   - Total paths for each starting direction: \( 21 \times 7 = 147 \).

4. **Combining Both Cases**:  
   Since there are two starting directions (R or U), the total number of paths is \( 147 \times 2 = 294 \).

Thus, the number of paths that change direction exactly four times is:

\boxed{294}
