Okay, so I've got this complex math problem to solve. The question is asking me to find the largest possible real part of the expression \[(75 + 117i)z + \frac{96 + 144i}{z}\] where \( z \) is a complex number with \(|z| = 4\). Hmm, that sounds a bit tricky, but let's break it down step by step.

First, I should recall that any complex number \( z \) can be expressed in polar form. Since the magnitude of \( z \) is 4, I can write \( z = 4e^{i\theta} \), where \( \theta \) is the argument of \( z \). That might make things easier to handle, especially since we're dealing with multiplications and divisions.

So, substituting \( z = 4e^{i\theta} \) into the expression, let's see:

The first term is \( (75 + 117i)z = (75 + 117i) \times 4e^{i\theta} \). Let me compute that. 

Similarly, the second term is \( \frac{96 + 144i}{z} = \frac{96 + 144i}{4e^{i\theta}} \). Since \( 1/z \) is \( \overline{z}/|z|^2 \), and \(|z| =4\), so \( 1/z = \overline{z}/16 \). Alternatively, in exponential form, \( 1/z = (1/4)e^{-i\theta} \).

Let me compute both terms separately.

First term: \( (75 + 117i) \times 4e^{i\theta} = 4(75 + 117i)e^{i\theta} \). Let me factor out the 4. Wait, 75 and 117 have a common factor. Let me see: 75 is 15*5, 117 is 13*9. Hmm, maybe 3? 75/3=25, 117/3=39. So, 3*(25 + 39i). So, the first term becomes 4*3*(25 + 39i)e^{iθ} = 12*(25 + 39i)e^{iθ}.

Second term: \( \frac{96 + 144i}{4e^{i\theta}} = (96 + 144i)/(4e^{iθ}) = (24 + 36i)/e^{iθ} \). Alternatively, \( (24 + 36i) e^{-iθ} \). Wait, because dividing by \( e^{iθ} \) is the same as multiplying by \( e^{-iθ} \).

So, the entire expression becomes:

\[ 12(25 + 39i)e^{iθ} + (24 + 36i)e^{-iθ} \]

Hmm, that looks like a combination of exponentials. Maybe I can simplify this by writing each term in terms of sine and cosine, using Euler's formula.

Alternatively, I can think of this as a sum of two complex exponentials, each multiplied by a complex coefficient.

Alternatively, perhaps I can write this expression as a single complex number in terms of \( e^{iθ} \) and \( e^{-iθ} \), and then take the real part.

Wait, another approach: Let me denote \( w = e^{iθ} \). Then \( e^{-iθ} = 1/w \). So, the expression becomes:

\( 12(25 + 39i)w + (24 + 36i)/w \)

Let me denote \( A = 12(25 + 39i) \) and \( B = 24 + 36i \). Then the expression is \( A w + B /w \).

We need to find the maximum of the real part of \( A w + B /w \) where \(|w| =1\) because \(|z|=4\) implies \(|w|=|z|/4=1\). So, \(w\) lies on the unit circle.

So, the problem reduces to maximizing \( \text{Re}(A w + B /w) \).

Hmm, that seems more manageable. So, I can write:

\( \text{Re}(A w + B /w) = \text{Re}(A w) + \text{Re}(B /w) \)

But \( \text{Re}(B /w) = \text{Re}(B \overline{w}) \) because \( 1/w = \overline{w} \) when \(|w|=1\).

So, that's equal to \( \text{Re}(A w + B \overline{w}) \).

Hmm, maybe I can express \( A w + B \overline{w} \) in terms of real and imaginary parts.

But perhaps it would be better to write \( A \) and \( B \) in terms of their real and imaginary components.

Let me compute \( A = 12(25 + 39i) = 12*25 + 12*39i = 300 + 468i \).

Similarly, \( B = 24 + 36i \).

So, our expression is \( (300 + 468i) w + (24 + 36i)/w \).

Expressed as \( A w + B /w \), where \( |w|=1 \).

Now, we need to compute the real part of this expression.

Let me write \( w = e^{iθ} = \cosθ + i sinθ \).

So, \( A w = (300 + 468i)(\cosθ + i sinθ) \). Let me compute that:

Multiply out the terms:

= 300 cosθ + 300 i sinθ + 468i cosθ + 468i^2 sinθ

= 300 cosθ + (300 sinθ + 468 cosθ) i + 468 (-1) sinθ

Because \( i^2 = -1 \), so the last term is -468 sinθ.

So, the real part of \( A w \) is \( 300 cosθ - 468 sinθ \).

Similarly, the imaginary part is \( 300 sinθ + 468 cosθ \).

Now, the other term is \( B /w = (24 + 36i)(1/w) = (24 + 36i)(\cosθ - i sinθ) \) because \( 1/w = e^{-iθ} = cosθ - i sinθ \).

Let me compute this:

= 24 cosθ - 24 i sinθ + 36i cosθ - 36i^2 sinθ

= 24 cosθ + ( -24 sinθ + 36 cosθ ) i + 36 sinθ

Again, since \( i^2 = -1 \), the term becomes +36 sinθ.

So, the real part of \( B /w \) is \( 24 cosθ + 36 sinθ \).

The imaginary part is \( -24 sinθ + 36 cosθ \).

Now, the total real part of the entire expression is the sum of the real parts from \( A w \) and \( B /w \):

Real part = [300 cosθ - 468 sinθ] + [24 cosθ + 36 sinθ]

Combine like terms:

= (300 + 24) cosθ + (-468 + 36) sinθ

= 324 cosθ - 432 sinθ

So, the real part of the expression is \( 324 \cosθ - 432 \sinθ \).

Our goal is to find the maximum value of this expression as θ varies.

So, to find the maximum of \( 324 \cosθ - 432 \sinθ \).

I recall that an expression of the form \( a \cosθ + b \sinθ \) has a maximum value of \( \sqrt{a^2 + b^2} \). Wait, actually, it's \( \sqrt{a^2 + b^2} \) because \( a \cosθ + b \sinθ = R \cos(θ - φ) \), where \( R = \sqrt{a^2 + b^2} \). So the maximum is R.

Wait, but in our case, the expression is \( 324 \cosθ - 432 \sinθ \), which can be written as \( a \cosθ + b \sinθ \) where \( a = 324 \) and \( b = -432 \).

So, the maximum value should be \( \sqrt{a^2 + b^2} \).

Let me compute that.

First, compute \( a^2 = 324^2 \). Let me compute 324 squared:

324 x 324: Let's see, 300^2 = 90,000, 24^2=576, and the cross term is 2*300*24 = 14,400. So, (300 +24)^2 = 300^2 + 2*300*24 +24^2 = 90,000 +14,400 +576 = 104,976.

Similarly, \( b^2 = (-432)^2 = 432^2. Let me compute that:

432 x 432: 400^2 = 160,000, 32^2 = 1,024, and 2*400*32=25,600. So, (400+32)^2 = 160,000 +25,600 +1,024 = 186,624.

So, \( a^2 + b^2 = 104,976 + 186,624 = 291,600 \).

Then, the square root of 291,600 is sqrt(291600). Hmm, let me see.

Well, sqrt(291600): Let me note that 291600 = 2916 * 100, so sqrt(2916)*sqrt(100) = 10*sqrt(2916).

What is sqrt(2916)? Let's compute 54^2 = 2916, because 50^2=2500, 55^2=3025. So 54*54=2916.

So sqrt(2916)=54, so sqrt(291600)=54*10=540.

So, the maximum real part is 540.

Wait, that seems straightforward. So the maximum real part is 540.

But wait, let me make sure. Because sometimes when you have a combination of cosθ and sinθ, the maximum is indeed the amplitude, which is sqrt(a^2 + b^2), and that's the maximum value.

In our case, the expression is \( 324 \cosθ -432 \sinθ \). Let me write it as \( a \cosθ + b \sinθ \), where a=324, b=-432.

So, the maximum is \( \sqrt{324^2 + (-432)^2} = \sqrt{104976 + 186624} = \sqrt{291600} = 540 \).

So yes, the maximum real part is 540.

Therefore, the largest possible real part of the given expression is 540.

To find the largest possible real part of the expression \((75 + 117i)z + \frac{96 + 144i}{z}\) where \(|z| = 4\), we start by expressing \(z\) in polar form as \(z = 4e^{i\theta}\). Substituting this into the expression, we rewrite it in terms of \(w = e^{i\theta}\), where \(|w| = 1\). The expression becomes \(12(25 + 39i)w + (24 + 36i)/w\).

Simplifying, we denote \(A = 300 + 468i\) and \(B = 24 + 36i\), so the expression is \(A w + B /w\). We compute the real part of this expression by expanding each term:

- The real part of \(A w\) is \(300 \cos\theta - 468 \sin\theta\).
- The real part of \(B /w\) is \(24 \cos\theta + 36 \sin\theta\).

Combining these, the total real part is \(324 \cos\theta - 432 \sin\theta\). To find the maximum value, we recognize this as a linear combination of sine and cosine, which has a maximum value of \(\sqrt{a^2 + b^2}\), where \(a = 324\) and \(b = -432\). Calculating this:

\[
\sqrt{324^2 + (-432)^2} = \sqrt{104976 + 186624} = \sqrt{291600} = 540.
\]

Thus, the largest possible real part is \(\boxed{540}\).
