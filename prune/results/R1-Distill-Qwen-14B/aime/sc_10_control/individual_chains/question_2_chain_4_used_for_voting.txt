Alright, I need to solve this geometry problem. Let me read it again and try to understand what's being asked.

We have three points: O at (0,0), A at (1/2, 0), and B at (0, sqrt(3)/2). So, O is the origin, A is halfway along the x-axis between O and (1,0), and B is somewhere along the y-axis, specifically at (0, sqrt(3)/2), which is approximately (0, 0.866). 

Then, there's this family F of segments PQ of unit length in the first quadrant. Each segment PQ has one endpoint P on the x-axis and the other Q on the y-axis. So, these are like line segments starting on the x-axis, going up to the y-axis, each of length 1.

The problem says that there's a unique point C on segment AB, not being A or B, that doesn't lie on any segment from F except for AB itself. So, AB is one of these segments in F, because it has P at (1/2, 0) and Q at (0, sqrt(3)/2), right? Let me check the length of AB to make sure it's 1.

Wait, the distance between A(1/2, 0) and B(0, sqrt(3)/2) is sqrt[(1/2)^2 + (sqrt(3)/2)^2] = sqrt[1/4 + 3/4] = sqrt[1] = 1. Yep, so AB is indeed a segment in F.

Now, the point C is on AB somewhere between A and B, not being A or B. The special thing about C is that it's not on any other segment from F except AB. So, for all other PQ in F, C doesn't lie on PQ. 

We need to find OC squared, where O is the origin, and then express it as a reduced fraction p/q, then find p + q.

So, I need to find the coordinates of point C on AB that isn't on any other PQ from F except AB. Then compute OC^2.

Hmm. So, maybe C is the point where AB is tangent to some envelope of the family F? Because if we think about all the segments PQ in F, they form lines from the x-axis to the y-axis with length 1. The envelope of these lines would form a curve, and perhaps AB is tangent to this curve at point C, which would make C the only point of intersection between AB and the envelope, hence not lying on any other PQ in F.

Alternatively, maybe C is the closest point to the origin on AB that is farther than all other points on AB from the origin? Not sure.

Wait, let me think about how the family F looks. Each PQ is a line segment from (x,0) to (0,y) with sqrt(x^2 + y^2) = 1. So, for each x between 0 and 1, y is sqrt(1 - x^2). So, the equation of PQ is y = (-y/x) x + y. Wait, that's the equation of the line connecting (x,0) to (0,y). The slope is (y - 0)/(0 - x) = -y/x. So, the equation is y = (-y/x) X + y.

But since y = sqrt(1 - x^2), we can write the equation as Y = (-sqrt(1 - x^2)/x) X + sqrt(1 - x^2). That's the equation for each PQ in F.

So, the family F can be represented parametrically by x, where x ranges from 0 to 1, with y = sqrt(1 - x^2). So, each line can be written as Y = (-sqrt(1 - x^2)/x) X + sqrt(1 - x^2).

Alternatively, maybe it's easier to represent the family in terms of t, where t is the x-intercept. So, let me set t = x. Then, y = sqrt(1 - t^2). So, the line PQ is Y = (-sqrt(1 - t^2)/t) X + sqrt(1 - t^2).

So, for each t in (0,1), we have a line in F.

Now, the envelope of this family is a curve that is tangent to each of these lines. So, the envelope is the set of points where each point lies on exactly one PQ in F, and the PQ at that point is tangent to the envelope.

If I can find the envelope, then the point C would be the point of tangency where AB touches the envelope. Because if AB is tangent to the envelope at C, then C is the only point where AB meets the envelope, and hence, C is not on any other PQ in F.

So, perhaps the strategy is to find the envelope of the family F, then find the equation of AB, find their intersection (which should be C), and then compute OC^2.

Alternatively, maybe I can find the envelope equation first.

To find the envelope of a family of curves given by F(t, X, Y) = 0, we can use the method where we solve the system:

F(t, X, Y) = 0

dF/dt = 0

So, let's write F(t, X, Y) = Y + (sqrt(1 - t^2)/t) X - sqrt(1 - t^2) = 0.

Let me rewrite the equation:

Y + (sqrt(1 - t^2)/t) X = sqrt(1 - t^2)

So, F(t, X, Y) = Y + (sqrt(1 - t^2)/t) X - sqrt(1 - t^2) = 0

Compute dF/dt:

dF/dt = [ derivative of Y w.r. to t: 0 ] + [ derivative of (sqrt(1 - t^2)/t) X w.r. to t ] - [ derivative of sqrt(1 - t^2) w.r. to t ]

But since X and Y are variables, I need to treat them as constants when taking derivative with respect to t.

So, dF/dt = X * d/dt [ sqrt(1 - t^2)/t ] - [ derivative of sqrt(1 - t^2) ]

Let me compute each derivative.

First, let me compute d/dt [ sqrt(1 - t^2)/t ].

Let me write sqrt(1 - t^2) as (1 - t^2)^(1/2). So, d/dt [ (1 - t^2)^(1/2) / t ].

Use the quotient rule: [ ( (1/2)(1 - t^2)^(-1/2)(-2t) ) * t - (1 - t^2)^(1/2) * 1 ] / t^2

Simplify numerator:

= [ (-t (1 - t^2)^(-1/2) ) * t - (1 - t^2)^(1/2) ] 

= [ (-t^2 (1 - t^2)^(-1/2) ) - (1 - t^2)^(1/2) ]

Factor out (1 - t^2)^(-1/2):

= (1 - t^2)^(-1/2) [ -t^2 - (1 - t^2) ]

= (1 - t^2)^(-1/2) [ -t^2 -1 + t^2 ]

= (1 - t^2)^(-1/2) [ -1 ]

So, the derivative is -1 / [ (1 - t^2)^(1/2) t^2 ]

Wait, let me re-express that:

Wait, the numerator after factoring was -1 * (1 - t^2)^(-1/2), and the denominator is t^2.

Wait, no, actually, the entire derivative was [numerator]/t^2, where numerator was -1 / (1 - t^2)^(1/2).

So, overall, d/dt [ sqrt(1 - t^2)/t ] = [ -1 / sqrt(1 - t^2) ] / t^2 = -1 / [ t^2 sqrt(1 - t^2) ]

So, going back to dF/dt:

dF/dt = X * [ -1 / ( t^2 sqrt(1 - t^2) ) ] - [ (-t) / sqrt(1 - t^2) ]

Because derivative of sqrt(1 - t^2) is (1/2)(1 - t^2)^(-1/2)(-2t) = -t / sqrt(1 - t^2)

So, putting it all together:

dF/dt = [ -X / ( t^2 sqrt(1 - t^2) ) ] + t / sqrt(1 - t^2 )

So, set dF/dt = 0:

[ -X / ( t^2 sqrt(1 - t^2) ) ] + [ t / sqrt(1 - t^2) ] = 0

Multiply both sides by sqrt(1 - t^2):

- X / t^2 + t = 0

So,

- X / t^2 + t = 0

=> t = X / t^2

=> X = t^3

So, X = t^3. Hmm, interesting.

Also, from the original equation F(t, X, Y) = 0:

Y + ( sqrt(1 - t^2)/t ) X = sqrt(1 - t^2)

We can substitute X = t^3 into this:

Y + ( sqrt(1 - t^2)/t ) * t^3 = sqrt(1 - t^2 )

Simplify:

Y + t^2 sqrt(1 - t^2) = sqrt(1 - t^2 )

So, Y = sqrt(1 - t^2 ) - t^2 sqrt(1 - t^2 )

Factor out sqrt(1 - t^2 ):

Y = sqrt(1 - t^2 )(1 - t^2 )

= (1 - t^2 )^(3/2 )

So, Y = (1 - t^2 )^(3/2 )

So, now, we have the parametric equations for the envelope:

X = t^3

Y = (1 - t^2 )^(3/2 )

So, the envelope is described by these parametric equations. So, to find the envelope, I can eliminate the parameter t.

Let me see if I can express t in terms of X and substitute into Y.

Since X = t^3, then t = X^(1/3). So, plug this into Y:

Y = (1 - (X^(1/3))^2 )^(3/2 )

= (1 - X^(2/3) )^(3/2 )

So, Y = (1 - X^(2/3) )^(3/2 )

So, that's the equation of the envelope.

Alternatively, to write it in a more familiar form, let's raise both sides to the power of 2/3:

Y^(2/3) = [ (1 - X^(2/3) )^(3/2 ) ]^(2/3 ) = 1 - X^(2/3 )

So,

Y^(2/3) + X^(2/3 ) = 1

Hmm, that's the equation of an astroid. Yeah, the envelope of these line segments forms an astroid.

So, the envelope is the astroid defined by X^(2/3) + Y^(2/3) = 1.

So, AB is tangent to this astroid at point C, meaning that point C is the point of tangency between AB and the astroid.

So, to find C, I need to find the point where AB is tangent to the astroid X^(2/3) + Y^(2/3) = 1.

Alternatively, perhaps I can parametrize AB and find where it's tangent to the astroid.

Wait, AB is the line segment from A(1/2, 0) to B(0, sqrt(3)/2). So, the equation of line AB.

Let me find the equation of AB. The slope is (sqrt(3)/2 - 0)/(0 - 1/2) = (sqrt(3)/2 ) / (-1/2 ) = -sqrt(3).

So, the equation is Y = -sqrt(3) X + c. Since it passes through A(1/2, 0):

0 = -sqrt(3)*(1/2) + c

=> c = sqrt(3)/2

So, the equation of AB is Y = -sqrt(3) X + sqrt(3)/2.

This line is tangent to the astroid X^(2/3) + Y^(2/3) = 1. So, the point C is the point of tangency.

So, to find the point of tangency, we can solve the system:

Y = -sqrt(3) X + sqrt(3)/2

and

X^(2/3) + Y^(2/3) = 1

So, substitute Y into the astroid equation.

Let me denote u = X^(1/3), v = Y^(1/3). Then, the astroid equation becomes u^2 + v^2 = 1.

But maybe substitution is better.

So, substituting Y:

X^(2/3) + [ (-sqrt(3) X + sqrt(3)/2 ) ]^(2/3) = 1

Hmm, that seems complicated. Maybe a better approach is to find the condition for the line to be tangent to the astroid.

The general equation for the tangent to the astroid X^(2/3) + Y^(2/3) = 1 is given by:

(2/3) X^(-1/3) + (2/3) Y^(-1/3) Y' = 0

Wait, no, let's compute the derivative implicitly.

Differentiate both sides with respect to X:

(2/3) X^(-1/3) + (2/3) Y^(-1/3) Y' = 0

So,

Y' = - [ X^(-1/3) / Y^(-1/3) ] = - [ Y^(1/3) / X^(1/3) ]

So, the slope of the tangent at any point (X, Y) on the astroid is m = - (Y / X )^(1/3 )

But we know that the tangent line has slope -sqrt(3). So,

- (Y / X )^(1/3 ) = -sqrt(3 )

So,

(Y / X )^(1/3 ) = sqrt(3 )

Cubing both sides:

Y / X = (sqrt(3 ))^3 = 3 sqrt(3 )

So,

Y = 3 sqrt(3 ) X

But wait, the tangent line to the astroid has equation Y = -sqrt(3) X + sqrt(3)/2.

So, setting Y = 3 sqrt(3) X into the line equation:

3 sqrt(3) X = -sqrt(3) X + sqrt(3)/2

Bring terms together:

3 sqrt(3) X + sqrt(3) X = sqrt(3)/2

4 sqrt(3) X = sqrt(3)/2

Divide both sides by sqrt(3):

4 X = 1/2

So,

X = 1/(8 )

So, X = 1/8.

Then, Y = 3 sqrt(3) * (1/8 ) = 3 sqrt(3)/8.

Wait, but wait a second, the line AB is Y = -sqrt(3) X + sqrt(3)/2.

So, plugging X=1/8 into this:

Y = -sqrt(3)*(1/8) + sqrt(3)/2 = (-sqrt(3)/8 ) + (4 sqrt(3)/8 ) = (3 sqrt(3))/8.

So, the point C is (1/8, 3 sqrt(3)/8 ).

Wait, but is that the point of tangency? Let me check.

Because the astroid equation is X^(2/3) + Y^(2/3)=1. Let's plug (1/8, 3 sqrt(3)/8 ) into this.

Compute (1/8)^(2/3 ) + (3 sqrt(3)/8 )^(2/3 )

First, (1/8)^(2/3 ) = ( (1/8)^(1/3) )^2 = (1/2)^2 = 1/4.

Second, (3 sqrt(3)/8 )^(2/3 ) = [ (3 sqrt(3))/8 ]^(2/3 )

Let me compute 3 sqrt(3) = 3 * 3^(1/2 ) = 3^(3/2 )

So, 3 sqrt(3)/8 = 3^(3/2 ) / 8.

So, [ 3^(3/2 ) /8 ]^(2/3 ) = [ 3^(3/2 ) ]^(2/3 ) / [8]^(2/3 )

= 3^( (3/2)*(2/3) ) / (8^(2/3) )

= 3^1 / (4 )

= 3/4.

So, adding together: 1/4 + 3/4 = 1. So, yes, it satisfies the astroid equation.

So, point C is (1/8, 3 sqrt(3)/8 ).

Is this on AB? Yes, because AB is from (1/2, 0) to (0, sqrt(3)/2). The point (1/8, 3 sqrt(3)/8 ) lies on AB because when X=1/8, Y=3 sqrt(3)/8, as we saw.

So, since it's the point of tangency, this is the unique point C that's on AB and not on any other PQ in F. So, we can now compute OC^2.

OC is the distance from O(0,0) to C(1/8, 3 sqrt(3)/8 ).

So, OC^2 = (1/8)^2 + (3 sqrt(3)/8 )^2

Compute each term:

(1/8)^2 = 1/64

(3 sqrt(3)/8 )^2 = (9 * 3 ) / 64 = 27/64

Add them together: 1/64 + 27/64 = 28/64 = 7/16.

So, OC^2 is 7/16.

So, p = 7, q = 16, and p + q = 23.

Wait, but let me just make sure I didn't make a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, Y = 3 sqrt(3)/8.

So, (3 sqrt(3)/8 )^2 = 9 * 3 / 64 = 27/64. Correct.

1/8 squared is 1/64.

1/64 + 27/64 = 28/64 = 7/16. Right.

So, OC^2 = 7/16.

So, 7 and 16 are coprime, so p + q = 7 + 16 = 23.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To solve the problem, we first note that the family of segments \( \overline{PQ} \) forms an envelope known as an astroid. The astroid is given by the equation \( X^{2/3} + Y^{2/3} = 1 \). The line segment \( \overline{AB} \) has the equation \( Y = -\sqrt{3}X + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \). 

To find the point \( C \) where \( \overline{AB} \) is tangent to the astroid, we use the condition for tangency. The slope of the tangent to the astroid at any point \( (X, Y) \) is \( -\left(\frac{Y}{X}\right)^{1/3} \). Setting this equal to the slope of \( \overline{AB} \), which is \( -\sqrt{3} \), we find that \( \left(\frac{Y}{X}\right)^{1/3} = \sqrt{3} \), leading to \( Y = 3\sqrt{3}X \).

Substituting \( Y = 3\sqrt{3}X \) into the line equation of \( \overline{AB} \), we solve for \( X \) and find \( X = \frac{1}{8} \). Substituting back, we get \( Y = \frac{3\sqrt{3}}{8} \). Thus, the coordinates of \( C \) are \( \left(\frac{1}{8}, \frac{3\sqrt{3}}{8}\right) \).

Finally, we compute \( OC^2 \):
\[
OC^2 = \left(\frac{1}{8}\right)^2 + \left(\frac{3\sqrt{3}}{8}\right)^2 = \frac{1}{64} + \frac{27}{64} = \frac{28}{64} = \frac{7}{16}.
\]
Thus, \( OC^2 = \frac{7}{16} \), and \( p + q = 7 + 16 = 23 \).

The final answer is \( \boxed{23} \).
