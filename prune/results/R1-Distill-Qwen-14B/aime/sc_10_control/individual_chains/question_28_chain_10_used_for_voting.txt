Okay, so I've got this problem about a tetrahedron ABCD. The edges are given in pairs: AB and CD are both sqrt(41), AC and BD are sqrt(80), and BC and AD are sqrt(89). The question is about finding the distance from a special point inside the tetrahedron to each of its faces. This distance is the same for all faces, so this point I is like the "incenter" of the tetrahedron, similar to the incenter in a triangle. The answer needs to be in a specific form and then we have to find the sum m + n + p.

First, I remember that in a tetrahedron, the inradius (the radius of the inscribed sphere) can be found using the formula: 

inradius = 3 * volume / surface area.

Wait, is that right? Let me think. In a triangle, the inradius is area divided by semiperimeter. For a tetrahedron, I believe it's 3 times the volume divided by the total surface area. Yeah, because volume is (1/3)*base area*height, so inradius would be 3V / A, where A is the total surface area.

So, the plan is: find the volume of the tetrahedron, compute the total surface area, and then use the formula inradius = 3V / A.

But wait, how do I find the volume of this tetrahedron? It's not a regular tetrahedron because all the edges aren't equal. The edges come in equal pairs: AB=CD, AC=BD, BC=AD. So it's maybe a kind of symmetric tetrahedron, perhaps called an isohedral or isosceles tetrahedron. I think the term is "equifacial" or maybe "isohedral," but I'm not sure. Whatever the case, the symmetry might help in computing the volume.

I remember that for a tetrahedron where opposite edges are equal, there is a formula for the volume. Alternatively, maybe I can place the tetrahedron in coordinate space in such a way that calculations are easier.

Let me try that approach. Let's assign coordinates to the vertices. Since opposite edges are equal, maybe I can set it up so that the tetrahedron is symmetric with respect to the origin. Let me think.

Let me denote the points as A, B, C, D. Since AB = CD, AC = BD, and BC = AD, perhaps I can set coordinates such that the midpoints of the opposite edges coincide. Hmm, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe I can set point A at (x, y, z), B at (-x, -y, -z), C at (a, b, c), and D at (-a, -b, -c). That way, the midpoints of AB and CD are at the origin. Maybe this symmetry would help.

But perhaps a better approach is to use vectors. Let me assign coordinates step by step.

Let me try to place point A at (0, 0, 0). Then, I need to assign coordinates to points B, C, D such that the given edge lengths are satisfied.

Wait, but given that AB=CD, AC=BD, and BC=AD, the tetrahedron is symmetric in a particular way. Maybe it's a "disphenoid," which is a tetrahedron where opposite edges are equal. That seems to fit here.

Yes, a disphenoid is a tetrahedron with four congruent triangular faces and opposite edges equal. Wait, but in this case, the faces might not all be congruent, because the edges are sqrt(41), sqrt(80), sqrt(89). Let me check: AB=CD=sqrt(41), AC=BD=sqrt(80), BC=AD=sqrt(89). So each pair of opposite edges is equal but the lengths are different for different pairs. So yes, it's a disphenoid.

In a disphenoid, all four faces are congruent, but in our case, the faces might not be congruent because the edge lengths are different. Wait, no. Wait, each face is a triangle. Let's see: each face is made up of edges from different pairs. For example, face ABC has edges AB, BC, and AC. AB is sqrt(41), BC is sqrt(89), AC is sqrt(80). Similarly, face ABD has edges AB, BD, AD: sqrt(41), sqrt(80), sqrt(89). So yes, each face is a triangle with sides sqrt(41), sqrt(80), sqrt(89). So all four faces are congruent. So this is indeed a disphenoid, which is a tetrahedron with four congruent triangular faces and opposite edges equal.

Therefore, the volume of a disphenoid can be calculated using a formula. I think the formula for the volume is sqrt( (a^2 + b^2 - c^2)(a^2 + c^2 - b^2)(b^2 + c^2 - a^2) ) / (something?), but I'm not sure. Wait, maybe that's for something else.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use the Cayley-Menger determinant. Yeah, that's a good approach for computing volumes of tetrahedrons given all the edge lengths. Since we know all the edges, this might be the way to go.

The Cayley-Menger determinant for a tetrahedron with edge lengths AB = a, AC = b, AD = c, BC = d, BD = e, CD = f is given by:

Volume = sqrt( determinant / 288 )

Where determinant is the determinant of the following matrix:

| 0   1    1    1    1  |
| 1   0   a²  b²  c² |
| 1  a²   0   d²  e² |
| 1  b²  d²   0   f² |
| 1  c²  e²  f²   0  |

So let's assign the edge lengths. Let me list all the edges:

AB = sqrt(41) => a = sqrt(41)
AC = sqrt(80) => b = sqrt(80)
AD = sqrt(89) => c = sqrt(89)
BC = sqrt(89) => d = sqrt(89)
BD = sqrt(80) => e = sqrt(80)
CD = sqrt(41) => f = sqrt(41)

Wait, let me confirm: AB=CD=sqrt(41), AC=BD=sqrt(80), BC=AD=sqrt(89). So yes, that's correct.

So plugging these into the Cayley-Menger matrix:

Row 0: 0, 1, 1, 1, 1

Row 1: 1, 0, (sqrt(41))², (sqrt(80))², (sqrt(89))²
Which is 1, 0, 41, 80, 89

Row 2: 1, 41, 0, (sqrt(89))², (sqrt(80))²
Which is 1, 41, 0, 89, 80

Row 3: 1, 80, 89, 0, (sqrt(41))²
Which is 1, 80, 89, 0, 41

Row 4: 1, 89, 80, 41, 0

Wait, let's make sure:

- The (1,2) entry is AB² = 41
- The (1,3) entry is AC² = 80
- The (1,4) entry is AD² = 89

Similarly for the others:

- (2,1)=41, (2,3)=0, (2,4)=89 (since BC= sqrt(89) => d²=89)
- Wait, hold on. Wait, the edges are:

Point 1: A
Point 2: B
Point 3: C
Point 4: D

So in the Cayley-Menger determinant, the entries are the squared distances between the points.

So:

CM[0][0] = 0
CM[0][1] = 1
CM[0][2] = 1
CM[0][3] = 1
CM[0][4] = 1

CM[1][0] = 1
CM[1][1] = 0
CM[1][2] = AB² = 41
CM[1][3] = AC² = 80
CM[1][4] = AD² = 89

CM[2][0] = 1
CM[2][1] = AB² = 41
CM[2][2] = 0
CM[2][3] = BC² = 89
CM[2][4] = BD² = 80

CM[3][0] = 1
CM[3][1] = AC² = 80
CM[3][2] = BC² = 89
CM[3][3] = 0
CM[3][4] = CD² = 41

CM[4][0] = 1
CM[4][1] = AD² = 89
CM[4][2] = BD² = 80
CM[4][3] = CD² = 41
CM[4][4] = 0

So the matrix is:

Row 0: 0, 1, 1, 1, 1

Row 1: 1, 0, 41, 80, 89

Row 2: 1, 41, 0, 89, 80

Row 3: 1, 80, 89, 0, 41

Row 4: 1, 89, 80, 41, 0

Now, I need to compute the determinant of this 5x5 matrix. That sounds complicated, but maybe we can find some symmetry or pattern to simplify it.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use the fact that it's a disphenoid and find a formula for the volume in terms of the edge lengths.

Wait, in a disphenoid, the volume can be computed as:

Volume = (sqrt( (a² + b² - c²)(a² + c² - b²)(b² + c² - a²) )) / (6 * sqrt(2))

Wait, but I'm not sure if that's correct. Let me think. Alternatively, perhaps the formula is Volume = (4/3) * sqrt( (a² + b² - c²)(a² + c² - b²)(b² + c² - a²) ) / something?

Wait, maybe I should just proceed with the Cayley-Menger determinant.

Alternatively, perhaps we can compute the determinant by subtracting rows to create zeros.

But 5x5 determinant is a bit too involved. Maybe another approach.

Wait, since it's a disphenoid, maybe the volume can be calculated using another method. Let's see.

Another approach for the volume of a disphenoid is as follows: since all faces are congruent, perhaps the tetrahedron can be inscribed in a rectangular box, and the volume can be calculated from the box dimensions.

Wait, that's a clever idea. In a disphenoid, you can fit it into a box such that each pair of opposite edges corresponds to the face diagonals of the box. So, if the box has dimensions x, y, z, then the edges of the tetrahedron would be the face diagonals. Let me see.

In that case, for each pair of opposite edges, their lengths would be face diagonals of the box. For example, AB and CD are sqrt(41). So, if AB is a face diagonal, then AB² = x² + y² = 41.

Similarly, AC and BD are sqrt(80), so AC² = x² + z² = 80.

And BC and AD are sqrt(89), so BC² = y² + z² = 89.

So we have three equations:

1. x² + y² = 41

2. x² + z² = 80

3. y² + z² = 89

So we can solve for x², y², z².

Let me subtract equation 1 from equation 2:

(x² + z²) - (x² + y²) = 80 - 41 => z² - y² = 39.

From equation 3: y² + z² = 89.

So we have:

z² - y² = 39

z² + y² = 89

Let's add these two equations:

2 z² = 128 => z² = 64 => z = 8.

Subtracting the equations:

2 y² = 50 => y² = 25 => y = 5.

Then from equation 1: x² + 25 = 41 => x² = 16 => x = 4.

So the dimensions of the box are 4, 5, 8.

Then, the volume of the tetrahedron is (4 * 5 * 8) / 3 = 160 / 3.

Wait, but no, hold on. For a disphenoid inscribed in a box with sides x, y, z, the volume of the tetrahedron is (x y z)/3. Because the box has volume x y z, and the tetrahedron occupies 1/6 of the box? Wait, no, wait.

Wait, actually, when you have a box and you connect alternating vertices, you get a tetrahedron whose volume is (box volume)/3. Wait, no, let me think. The box can be divided into 6 such tetrahedrons, each congruent. So each would have volume (x y z)/6.

Wait, but in our case, the tetrahedron is formed by four vertices of the box, each connected to the opposite corners. So for example, if the box has vertices (0,0,0), (x,0,0), (0,y,0), (0,0,z), and the disphenoid connects (0,0,0), (x,y,0), (x,0,z), and (0,y,z), or something like that. Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating.

Alternatively, since the tetrahedron is inscribed in the box, and the edges correspond to face diagonals, the volume of the tetrahedron would be (x y z)/3.

Wait, let me check. The volume of the box is x y z. If the tetrahedron is formed by four non-overlapping corners such that each edge is a space diagonal, but no, in our case, the edges are face diagonals. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I should visualize it. In the box with sides x, y, z, if the tetrahedron has vertices at (0,0,0), (x, y, 0), (x, 0, z), and (0, y, z), then each edge between these points is a face diagonal.

Compute the distance between (0,0,0) and (x,y,0): sqrt(x² + y²) = AB = sqrt(41).

Distance between (0,0,0) and (x,0,z): sqrt(x² + z²) = AC = sqrt(80).

Distance between (0,0,0) and (0,y,z): sqrt(y² + z²) = AD = sqrt(89).

Which matches our edge lengths. So the volume of this tetrahedron can be computed using the scalar triple product.

The vectors from (0,0,0) to the other three points are:

a = (x, y, 0)

b = (x, 0, z)

c = (0, y, z)

The volume is (1/6) | scalar triple product of a, b, c |.

Compute the scalar triple product:

a ⋅ (b × c)

First, compute b × c:

b × c = |i  j  k|
         |x  0  z|
         |0  y  z|

= i*(0*z - z*y) - j*(x*z - z*0) + k*(x*y - 0*0)

= i*(-y z) - j*(x z) + k*(x y)

So, b × c = (-y z, -x z, x y)

Then, a ⋅ (b × c) = (x, y, 0) ⋅ (-y z, -x z, x y)

= x*(-y z) + y*(-x z) + 0*(x y)

= -x y z - x y z + 0

= -2 x y z

The absolute value is 2 x y z, so the volume is (1/6)*2 x y z = (x y z)/3.

So yes, the volume is (x y z)/3.

Given that x=4, y=5, z=8, the volume is (4*5*8)/3 = 160/3.

Great! So the volume V = 160/3.

Next, we need the total surface area. Each face is a triangle with sides sqrt(41), sqrt(80), sqrt(89). So all faces are congruent.

So, compute the area of one face and multiply by 4.

But wait, let's confirm that all faces are congruent. Each face has sides sqrt(41), sqrt(80), sqrt(89). So yes, all four faces are congruent triangles.

So compute the area of one face and multiply by 4 to get the total surface area.

To compute the area of a triangle with sides a, b, c, we can use Heron's formula. The semi-perimeter s = (a + b + c)/2.

So for our triangle, s = (sqrt(41) + sqrt(80) + sqrt(89))/2.

But that seems complicated. Maybe there's a better way since we know the edge lengths and the coordinates.

Alternatively, since we placed the tetrahedron in a box, perhaps each face is a triangle with area equal to ½ * x y, ½ * x z, or something. Wait, no, each face is a triangle in 3D space, not necessarily aligned with the box faces.

Wait, perhaps another approach. Since we know the edge lengths, perhaps compute the area using Heron's formula.

Alternatively, maybe we can use vectors again.

Wait, but Heron's formula is straightforward. Let's try that.

First, compute the semi-perimeter s:

s = (sqrt(41) + sqrt(80) + sqrt(89))/2.

But that's messy. Alternatively, perhaps we can compute the area using the formula:

Area = sqrt( s(s - a)(s - b)(s - c) )

But let me compute numerically:

sqrt(41) ≈ 6.4031

sqrt(80) ≈ 8.9443

sqrt(89) ≈ 9.433

So s ≈ (6.4031 + 8.9443 + 9.433)/2 ≈ (24.7804)/2 ≈ 12.3902

Then,

Area ≈ sqrt(12.3902*(12.3902 - 6.4031)*(12.3902 - 8.9443)*(12.3902 - 9.433))

Compute each term:

12.3902 - 6.4031 ≈ 5.9871

12.3902 - 8.9443 ≈ 3.4459

12.3902 - 9.433 ≈ 2.9572

So,

Area ≈ sqrt(12.3902 * 5.9871 * 3.4459 * 2.9572 )

Calculate the product inside:

First, 12.3902 * 5.9871 ≈ 12.3902*6 ≈ ~74.34, but more accurately:

12.3902 *5.9871 ≈ 12 *5.9871=71.8452; 0.3902*5.9871≈2.337; total ≈74.182.

Then, 3.4459 * 2.9572 ≈ 3.4459*3≈10.3377 minus 3.4459*0.0428≈0.1479, so ≈10.1898.

Multiply the two products: 74.182 * 10.1898 ≈ Let's approximate 74 *10=740, 74*0.1898≈14.01, 0.182*10≈1.82, 0.182*0.1898≈0.0346. So total≈740 +14.01 +1.82 +0.0346≈755.8646.

So Area ≈ sqrt(755.8646) ≈27.5.

Wait, that's an approximate value. But we need an exact value.

Alternatively, maybe we can find the area using the coordinates.

Wait, since the tetrahedron is placed in a box with sides 4,5,8, each face is a triangle with sides sqrt(41), sqrt(80), sqrt(89). Alternatively, perhaps we can compute the area using vectors.

Wait, consider triangle ABC. Points A(0,0,0), B(4,5,0), C(4,0,8). Wait, no, earlier I considered a different coordinate system, perhaps. Wait, no, in the box, the points are A(0,0,0), B(x,y,0), C(x,0,z), D(0,y,z). So for x=4, y=5, z=8.

So point B is (4,5,0), point C is (4,0,8), point D is (0,5,8).

So let's compute vectors AB, AC, etc.

Wait, vectors AB = B - A = (4,5,0)

Vectors AC = C - A = (4,0,8)

Vectors AD = D - A = (0,5,8)

So for triangle ABC, with points A, B, C.

Compute vectors AB and AC, then the area is ½ |AB × AC|.

Compute AB × AC.

AB = (4,5,0)

AC = (4,0,8)

Cross product AB × AC:

|i    j    k|
|4    5    0|
|4    0    8|

= i*(5*8 - 0*0) - j*(4*8 - 0*4) + k*(4*0 - 5*4)

= i*(40) - j*(32) + k*(-20)

So AB × AC = (40, -32, -20)

The magnitude squared is 40² + (-32)² + (-20)² = 1600 + 1024 + 400 = 3024.

So the magnitude is sqrt(3024).

Simplify sqrt(3024):

3024 = 16 * 189 = 16 * 9 * 21 = 16 * 9 * 3 * 7.

So sqrt(3024) = 4 * 3 * sqrt(21) = 12 sqrt(21).

Therefore, the area of triangle ABC is ½ * 12 sqrt(21) = 6 sqrt(21).

Wait, that's much better. So each face has area 6 sqrt(21).

Hence, the total surface area A = 4 * 6 sqrt(21) = 24 sqrt(21).

Wait, that's the total surface area.

So now, back to the inradius formula: inradius r = 3V / A.

We have V = 160/3, A = 24 sqrt(21).

So,

r = 3*(160/3) / (24 sqrt(21)) = 160 / (24 sqrt(21)).

Simplify:

160 / 24 = (160 ÷ 8) / (24 ÷8) = 20 / 3.

So r = (20 / 3) / sqrt(21) = (20)/(3 sqrt(21)).

Rationalize the denominator:

(20 sqrt(21)) / (3 * 21) = (20 sqrt(21)) / 63.

Simplify numerator and denominator:

20 and 63 have no common factors. 21 is square-free.

So the distance is (20 sqrt(21))/63.

Expressed as m sqrt(n)/p, where m=20, n=21, p=63.

Wait, but m and p must be coprime. 20 and 63: factors of 20 are 2,4,5,10,20; factors of 63 are 3,7,9,21,63. They share no common factors, so yes, m=20, n=21, p=63.

So m + n + p = 20 + 21 + 63 = 104.

Wait, but wait. Let me double-check the inradius formula. I thought inradius = 3V / A. Let me confirm.

In 3D, the formula for the inradius of a tetrahedron is indeed r = 3V / A, where V is the volume, and A is the total surface area. Because the volume can also be expressed as (1/3)*r*A, hence r = 3V / A. So that's correct.

So the inradius is 20 sqrt(21)/63, so m + n + p is 20 +21+63=104.

Hmm, but wait, 63 can be divided by 3. Hmm, but 20 and 63 are coprime, so that's okay. So, yeah, 104 is the answer.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To solve the problem, we start by recognizing that the given tetrahedron is a disphenoid with opposite edges equal. We use the Cayley-Menger determinant to find the volume and then compute the inradius.

### Step 1: Volume Calculation
We place the tetrahedron in a coordinate system where it is inscribed in a box with dimensions \(x\), \(y\), and \(z\). The edge lengths correspond to face diagonals:
- \(AB = CD = \sqrt{41}\) implies \(x^2 + y^2 = 41\)
- \(AC = BD = \sqrt{80}\) implies \(x^2 + z^2 = 80\)
- \(BC = AD = \sqrt{89}\) implies \(y^2 + z^2 = 89\)

Solving these equations:
1. \(x^2 + y^2 = 41\)
2. \(x^2 + z^2 = 80\)
3. \(y^2 + z^2 = 89\)

Subtracting (1) from (2): \(z^2 - y^2 = 39\). Adding this to (3): \(2z^2 = 128 \implies z^2 = 64 \implies z = 8\). Substituting back, we find \(y^2 = 25 \implies y = 5\) and \(x^2 = 16 \implies x = 4\).

The volume of the tetrahedron is \(\frac{1}{3} \times x \times y \times z = \frac{1}{3} \times 4 \times 5 \times 8 = \frac{160}{3}\).

### Step 2: Surface Area Calculation
Each face is a triangle with sides \(\sqrt{41}\), \(\sqrt{80}\), and \(\sqrt{89}\). Using vectors, the area of one face is found using the cross product:
- Vectors \(\vec{AB} = (4, 5, 0)\) and \(\vec{AC} = (4, 0, 8)\)
- Cross product \(\vec{AB} \times \vec{AC} = (40, -32, -20)\)
- Magnitude: \(\sqrt{40^2 + (-32)^2 + (-20)^2} = \sqrt{3024} = 12\sqrt{21}\)
- Area of one face: \(\frac{1}{2} \times 12\sqrt{21} = 6\sqrt{21}\)

Total surface area: \(4 \times 6\sqrt{21} = 24\sqrt{21}\).

### Step 3: Inradius Calculation
The inradius \(r\) is given by \(r = \frac{3V}{A}\):
- \(r = \frac{3 \times \frac{160}{3}}{24\sqrt{21}} = \frac{160}{24\sqrt{21}} = \frac{20}{3\sqrt{21}}\)
- Rationalizing: \(r = \frac{20\sqrt{21}}{63}\)

Expressing \(r\) as \(\frac{m\sqrt{n}}{p}\), we have \(m = 20\), \(n = 21\), and \(p = 63\). Thus, \(m + n + p = 20 + 21 + 63 = 104\).

### Final Answer
\boxed{104}
