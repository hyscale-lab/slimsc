Alright, so I've got this math problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again and make sure I understand what it's asking.

It says: Let N be the greatest four-digit positive integer with the property that whenever one of its digits is changed to 1, the resulting number is divisible by 7. Then, Q and R are the quotient and remainder when N is divided by 1000. I need to find Q + R.

Okay, so N is a four-digit number, meaning it's between 1000 and 9999. And it has this special property: if you change any one of its digits to 1, the new number is divisible by 7. My goal is to find the largest such N, then divide it by 1000 to get Q and R, and sum those.

Hmm. Let me think about how to approach this.

First, let's represent N as a four-digit number. Let me denote N as ABCD, where A, B, C, D are its digits. So, A is the thousands digit, B is hundreds, C is tens, and D is ones.

The condition is that if we change any one digit to 1, the resulting number is divisible by 7. So, changing A to 1, or B to 1, or C to 1, or D to 1, each time gives a number that's a multiple of 7.

So, for each digit position, replacing it with 1 gives a number divisible by 7. Therefore, we can write four different equations based on each replacement.

Let me write these equations out:

1. Replacing A with 1: 1BCD is divisible by 7.
2. Replacing B with 1: A1CD is divisible by 7.
3. Replacing C with 1: AB1D is divisible by 7.
4. Replacing D with 1: ABC1 is divisible by 7.

So, each of these four numbers must be congruent to 0 mod 7.

But N is the largest such number. So, to maximize N, we want the highest possible digits starting from the left.

So, perhaps starting with 9999 and working our way down, checking for the condition. But that might be time-consuming. Maybe there's a smarter approach.

Alternatively, let's think about what each of these conditions implies.

Let me represent each of the four modified numbers as:

1. 1000 + 100B + 10C + D ≡ 0 mod 7
2. 1000A + 100 + 10C + D ≡ 0 mod 7
3. 1000A + 100B + 10 + D ≡ 0 mod 7
4. 1000A + 100B + 10C + 1 ≡ 0 mod 7

So, we can write these as four separate congruences.

Let me denote N as 1000A + 100B + 10C + D.

So, each modified number is N with one digit replaced by 1. Let's write that.

1. When A is replaced by 1: N - (1000A - 1000) = (1000 - 1000A) + N ≡ 0 mod 7
Wait, no, perhaps a better approach is to express each modified number in terms of N.

Wait, when we replace A with 1, the number becomes 1BCD, which is 1000 + 100B + 10C + D. Similarly, the original N is 1000A + 100B + 10C + D.

Therefore, the modified number is N - (1000A - 1000) = N - 1000(A - 1). Hmm, but that might not be the easiest way.

Alternatively, perhaps express each modified number as:

1. Modified A: 1000 + 100B + 10C + D ≡ 0 mod 7
2. Modified B: 1000A + 100 + 10C + D ≡ 0 mod 7
3. Modified C: 1000A + 100B + 10 + D ≡ 0 mod 7
4. Modified D: 1000A + 100B + 10C + 1 ≡ 0 mod 7

So, each of these four expressions must be 0 mod 7. Let me write equations based on that.

Let me denote:

1. 1000 + 100B + 10C + D ≡ 0 mod 7 → Let's call this Equation (1)
2. 1000A + 100 + 10C + D ≡ 0 mod 7 → Equation (2)
3. 1000A + 100B + 10 + D ≡ 0 mod 7 → Equation (3)
4. 1000A + 100B + 10C + 1 ≡ 0 mod 7 → Equation (4)

So, we have four equations.

Now, perhaps subtracting these equations from each other can help eliminate variables.

Let's compute Equation (1) - Equation (2):

(1000 + 100B + 10C + D) - (1000A + 100 + 10C + D) ≡ 0 mod 7

Simplify:

1000 - 1000A + 100B - 100 ≡ 0 mod 7

So, 1000(1 - A) + 100(B - 1) ≡ 0 mod 7

Similarly, 1000 ≡ (mod 7). Let's compute 1000 mod 7.

Since 7*142 = 994, 1000 - 994 = 6. So, 1000 ≡ 6 mod 7.

Similarly, 100 mod 7: 7*14=98, so 100 - 98 = 2 → 100 ≡ 2 mod 7.

So, substituting back:

6*(1 - A) + 2*(B - 1) ≡ 0 mod 7

Let's compute this:

6 - 6A + 2B - 2 ≡ 0 mod 7

Simplify:

(6 - 2) + (-6A + 2B) ≡ 0 mod 7 → 4 + (-6A + 2B) ≡ 0 mod 7

Let me rearrange:

-6A + 2B ≡ -4 mod 7 → 6A - 2B ≡ 4 mod 7.

We can write this as:

6A - 2B ≡ 4 mod 7.

Simplify by dividing both sides by 2 (since 2 and 7 are coprime, division is allowed):

3A - B ≡ 2 mod 7.

So, equation from (1)-(2) is 3A - B ≡ 2 mod 7. Let's call this Equation (5).

Now, let's compute Equation (2) - Equation (3):

(1000A + 100 + 10C + D) - (1000A + 100B + 10 + D) ≡ 0 mod 7

Simplify:

100 - 100B + 10C - 10 ≡ 0 mod 7

Which is 90 - 100B + 10C ≡ 0 mod 7.

Again, let's compute 90 mod 7 and 100 mod 7, 10 mod 7:

90 ÷ 7 is 12*7=84, remainder 6. So, 90 ≡ 6 mod 7.

100 ≡ 2 mod 7 (as before), so -100B ≡ -2B mod 7.

10C ≡ 3C mod 7 (since 10 ≡ 3 mod 7).

So, putting it all together:

6 - 2B + 3C ≡ 0 mod 7.

Rearranged:

-2B + 3C ≡ -6 mod 7 → 2B - 3C ≡ 6 mod 7.

Let me write this as Equation (6): 2B - 3C ≡ 6 mod 7.

Now, let's compute Equation (3) - Equation (4):

(1000A + 100B + 10 + D) - (1000A + 100B + 10C + 1) ≡ 0 mod 7

Simplify:

10 - 10C + D - 1 ≡ 0 mod 7 → 9 - 10C + D ≡ 0 mod 7.

Compute 9 mod 7: 9 ≡ 2 mod 7.

-10C ≡ (-3)C mod 7 (since 10 ≡ 3 mod 7).

So, 2 - 3C + D ≡ 0 mod 7.

Rearranged: -3C + D ≡ -2 mod 7 → 3C - D ≡ 2 mod 7.

Equation (7): 3C - D ≡ 2 mod 7.

Now, let's compute Equation (2) - Equation (4):

(1000A + 100 + 10C + D) - (1000A + 100B + 10C + 1) ≡ 0 mod 7

Simplify:

100 - 100B + D - 1 ≡ 0 mod 7 → 99 - 100B + D ≡ 0 mod 7.

Compute 99 mod 7: 7*14=98, so 99 ≡ 1 mod 7.

-100B ≡ -2B mod 7.

So, equation becomes:

1 - 2B + D ≡ 0 mod 7 → -2B + D ≡ -1 mod 7 → 2B - D ≡ 1 mod 7.

Equation (8): 2B - D ≡ 1 mod 7.

Now, let me summarize the equations we have so far:

Equation (5): 3A - B ≡ 2 mod 7.

Equation (6): 2B - 3C ≡ 6 mod 7.

Equation (7): 3C - D ≡ 2 mod 7.

Equation (8): 2B - D ≡ 1 mod 7.

Hmm. So, now we have four equations, but they might not all be independent. Let me see if I can solve them step by step.

Starting with Equation (5): 3A - B ≡ 2 mod 7.

Let me express B in terms of A:

B ≡ 3A - 2 mod 7. Equation (5a).

Similarly, Equation (6): 2B - 3C ≡ 6 mod 7.

From Equation (5a), B ≡ 3A -2 mod 7. Let's substitute B into Equation (6).

So, 2*(3A - 2) - 3C ≡ 6 mod 7.

Compute 2*(3A -2) = 6A -4.

So, 6A -4 -3C ≡ 6 mod 7.

Bring -4 to the other side: 6A -3C ≡ 6 +4 mod 7 → 6A -3C ≡ 10 mod 7.

But 10 mod 7 is 3. So, 6A -3C ≡ 3 mod 7.

Divide both sides by 3 (since 3 and 7 are coprime):

2A - C ≡ 1 mod 7.

So, Equation (6a): C ≡ 2A -1 mod 7.

Next, Equation (7): 3C - D ≡ 2 mod 7.

From Equation (6a), C ≡ 2A -1 mod 7. Substitute into Equation (7):

3*(2A -1) - D ≡ 2 mod 7.

Compute: 6A -3 - D ≡ 2 mod 7.

Bring -3 to the other side: 6A - D ≡ 2 +3 mod 7 → 6A - D ≡ 5 mod 7.

So, Equation (7a): D ≡ 6A -5 mod 7.

Now, Equation (8): 2B - D ≡ 1 mod 7.

Again, substitute B from Equation (5a) and D from Equation (7a).

B ≡ 3A -2 mod7; D ≡ 6A -5 mod7.

So, 2*(3A -2) - (6A -5) ≡ 1 mod7.

Compute: 6A -4 -6A +5 ≡ 1 mod7.

Simplify: (6A -6A) + (-4 +5) ≡ 1 mod7 → 0A +1 ≡1 mod7.

So, 1 ≡1 mod7. Which is always true. So, Equation (8) doesn't give us new information beyond Equations (5), (6), and (7). So, our variables are expressed in terms of A.

So, to summarize:

B ≡ 3A -2 mod7.

C ≡ 2A -1 mod7.

D ≡ 6A -5 mod7.

So, now we can express B, C, D in terms of A modulo7.

But since A, B, C, D are digits (0-9), we can find their possible values.

Let me note that A is the thousands digit, so A can be from 1 to9, inclusive.

But since N is the greatest four-digit number with this property, we want A to be as large as possible. So, ideally, we want A=9, but we need to check if the other digits can satisfy the conditions.

So, let's attempt A=9 first.

Case 1: A=9.

Compute B, C, D modulo7.

B ≡3*9 -2 mod7 → 27 -2 =25 → 25 mod7: 7*3=21, 25-21=4. So, B≡4 mod7.

Since B is a digit, possible values for B are 4 or 11, but 11 is invalid, so B=4.

C ≡2*9 -1 mod7 →18 -1=17 →17 mod7: 7*2=14, 17-14=3. So, C≡3 mod7. Possible values are 3, 10 (invalid). So, C=3.

D ≡6*9 -5 mod7 →54 -5=49 →49 mod7=0. So, D≡0 mod7. D is a digit, so possible D=0 or7.

So, D can be 0 or7.

So, with A=9, B=4, C=3, D can be 0 or7.

So, let's check if N=9430 or N=9437 satisfies the original condition.

But wait, N is the greatest four-digit number, so between 9437 and 9430, 9437 is larger, so let's check N=9437 first.

But before that, let's confirm that all the equations are satisfied.

So, N=9437.

We need to check that replacing any digit with 1 gives a multiple of7.

Let's compute each modified number.

1. Replace A with1: 1437.

Check if 1437 is divisible by7.

Compute 1437 ÷7: 7*205=1435, 1437-1435=2. So, 1437≡2 mod7. Not divisible by7. So, N=9437 doesn't satisfy the condition.

Hence, N=9437 is invalid.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake. Let me check again.

Wait, when we set A=9, we get B=4, C=3, D=0 or7. So, N can be 9430 or 9437. But let's check both.

First, N=9437.

Replacing A with1: 1437.

As above, 1437 ÷7 = 205.285..., remainder 2. Not divisible by7. So, N=9437 fails the condition.

Now, N=9430.

Replacing A with1: 1430.

Check if 1430 is divisible by7.

Compute 1430 ÷7: 7*204=1428, 1430-1428=2. So, 1430≡2 mod7. Not divisible. Therefore, N=9430 also doesn't satisfy the condition. So, both N=9430 and 9437 fail.

Hmm. So, A=9 doesn't seem to work. So, maybe A=8.

Case 2: A=8.

Compute B, C, D modulo7.

B ≡3*8 -2 mod7 →24 -2=22 →22 mod7: 7*3=21, 22-21=1 → B≡1 mod7.

Possible B=1 or 8 (since B is a digit: 0-9). But 8 is ≡1 mod7 because 8-7=1. So, B can be1 or8.

C ≡2*8 -1 mod7 →16 -1=15 →15 mod7=1. So, C≡1 mod7. So, possible C=1 or8.

D ≡6*8 -5 mod7 →48-5=43 →43 mod7: 7*6=42, so 43-42=1 → D≡1 mod7. So, D=1 or8.

So, A=8, B can be1 or8, C can be1 or8, D can be1 or8.

So, let's see. Since we want the greatest N, we want the largest possible digits. So, B=8, C=8, D=8.

So, N=8888.

But let's check if N=8888 satisfies the condition.

Wait, let me compute each modified number:

1. Replace A with1: 1888.

Check 1888 ÷7: 7*269=1883, 1888-1883=5 → remainder5. Not divisible by7.

So, N=8888 fails.

Wait, maybe the digits aren't all 8. Let's think: perhaps B, C, D take the minimal possible value. But since we want the maximum N, we need to choose the largest possible digits.

Wait, perhaps I need to find the correct B, C, D for A=8.

Wait, let's figure out possible B, C, D for A=8. Since B≡1 mod7, B can be1 or8.

Similarly for C and D.

So, for maximum N, we'd set B=8, C=8, D=8. But as above, N=8888 doesn't satisfy the condition.

Alternatively, perhaps another combination: B=8, C=8, D=1.

Wait, but let's check each modified number.

Let me try N=8881.

Replace A with1: 1881.

1881 ÷7: 7*268=1876, 1881-1876=5 → remainder5. Not divisible by7.

Hmm. Maybe another combination.

Alternatively, what's the correct way? Maybe let's compute each modified number and see if they are divisible by7. But that's time-consuming.

Alternatively, perhaps I need to go back and ensure that the equations we derived, which were mod7, are satisfied.

Wait, but with A=8, B=1.

Wait, if we set B=1, C=1, D=1, N=8111.

But that's much smaller than 8888. But we need the maximum N, so higher digits are better.

Wait, perhaps I need to see what's the correct value for B, C, D for A=8.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the earlier reasoning. Let me re-express the equations.

Wait, for A=8:

B ≡3*8 -2 mod7 →24-2=22≡1 mod7. So, B≡1 mod7.

So, B can be1 or8.

Similarly, C≡2*8 -1=16-1=15≡1 mod7. So, C=1 or8.

D≡6*8 -5=48-5=43≡1 mod7. So, D=1 or8.

So, for each digit, they can be either 1 or8, mod7.

So, to maximize N, set B=8, C=8, D=8.

So, N=8888.

But as above, when we change A to1, we get 1888. 1888 ÷7: 7*269=1883, 1888-1883=5. Not divisible.

So, A=8 doesn't work. So, perhaps try A=7.

Case3: A=7.

Compute B, C, D.

B ≡3*7 -2 mod7→21-2=19≡5 mod7. So, B≡5 mod7. Possible B=5 or12→12 is invalid, so B=5.

C≡2*7 -1 mod7→14-1=13≡6 mod7. So, C≡6 mod7. So, C=6 or13→invalid, thus C=6.

D≡6*7 -5 mod7→42-5=37≡2 mod7. So, D≡2 mod7. So, D=2 or9.

So, for A=7, B=5, C=6, D=2 or9. So, N can be 7562 or7569.

Which is larger? 7569 is larger. So, let's check N=7569.

Check each modified number:

1. Replace A with1: 1569.

1569 ÷7: 7*224=1568, 1569-1568=1 → remainder1. Not divisible by7.

So, N=7569 fails.

Alternatively, N=7562.

Replace A with1:1562.

1562 ÷7: 7*223=1561, 1562-1561=1 → remainder1. So, not divisible.

Hmm, both N=7562 and 7569 fail when replacing A with1. So, A=7 doesn't work.

Case4: A=6.

Compute B, C, D.

B≡3*6-2=18-2=16≡2 mod7. So, B=2 or9.

C≡2*6-1=12-1=11≡4 mod7. So, C=4 or11→invalid, so C=4.

D≡6*6-5=36-5=31≡3 mod7. So, D=3 or10→invalid, so D=3.

So, for A=6, B=2 or9, C=4, D=3.

To maximize N, set B=9, others to max: but B=9 is allowed as 9≡2 mod7? Wait, 9 mod7 is2. So, yes, B=9 is ≡2 mod7. So, set B=9, C=4, D=3.

Thus, N=6943.

Check if this N satisfies the condition.

Replace A with1:1943.

Check divisibility by7: 1943 ÷7. 7*277=1939, 1943-1939=4 → remainder4. Not divisible.

So, N=6943 fails.

Alternatively, perhaps set B=2, C=4, D=3: N=6243.

But that's smaller than 6943. So, let's check N=6943.

Wait, already checked, it fails when A is replaced with1.

Thus, A=6 also doesn't work.

Case5: A=5.

Compute B, C, D.

B≡3*5-2=15-2=13≡6 mod7. So, B=6 or13→invalid, so B=6.

C≡2*5 -1=10-1=9≡2 mod7. So, C=2 or9.

D≡6*5 -5=30-5=25≡4 mod7. So, D=4 or11→invalid, so D=4.

To maximize N, set B=6, C=9, D=4.

So, N=5 6 9 4 →5694.

Check each modified number.

1. Replace A with1:1694.

1694 ÷7: 7*242=1694. Oh, that's exact. So, 1694 is divisible by7.

Good.

2. Replace B with1:5194.

5194 ÷7: Let's compute.

7*742=5194? Let's see: 7*700=4900, 7*42=294. 4900+294=5194. Yes, 7*742=5194. So, divisible by7.

Good.

3. Replace C with1:5614.

5614 ÷7: Let's compute.

7*802=5614? 7*800=5600, 7*2=14. 5600+14=5614. Yes, divisible by7.

4. Replace D with1:5691.

5691 ÷7: Let's compute.

7*813=5691. 7*800=5600, 7*13=91. 5600+91=5691. So yes, divisible by7.

So, all four modified numbers are divisible by7. So, N=5694 satisfies the condition.

But wait, is this the largest possible N? Because we had A=5, but maybe a higher A with a lower digit somewhere could result in a higher N.

Wait, we tried A=9,8,7,6, and they didn't work. So, perhaps A=5 is the maximum.

But wait, let's check if any higher A (but less than 9) could satisfy the condition.

Wait, perhaps I made an error in calculation for A=7 or A=8.

Wait, let me double-check A=8 case.

Earlier, for A=8:

We had B≡1 mod7, so B=1 or8.

C≡1 mod7, so C=1 or8.

D≡1 mod7, so D=1 or8.

So, N could be 8888 or 8881, etc.

But when we set N=8888, changing A to1 gives 1888. Which is 1888 mod7=5, as before.

Wait, perhaps a different combination of B, C, D for A=8.

Wait, maybe if B=1, C=1, D=1, N=8111.

But that's lower than 8888, but let's check the condition.

Replace A with1:1111.

1111 ÷7: 7*158=1106, 1111-1106=5 → remainder5. Not divisible.

Hmm. So, regardless of the digits, if A=8, changing A to1 would give a number starting with1, which may not be divisible by7.

Thus, perhaps the only way for A=8 is if 1BCD is divisible by7. But as in the earlier case, N=8888 gives 1888 which is not divisible by7. So, perhaps A=8 isn't possible.

Similarly, for A=7, N=7569 or 7562 didn't work when we changed A to1.

So, the next possible A=5, which gives N=5694, which works.

But let's check if there is a higher N with A=5 but with larger digits in B, C, D.

Wait, for A=5, we have:

B≡6 mod7. So, B=6 or13→ invalid, so B=6.

C≡2 mod7: C=2 or9.

D≡4 mod7: D=4 or11→invalid, so D=4.

So, to maximize N, we set B=6 (since next is 13 which isn't allowed), C=9, D=4. So, N=5694.

Is there a higher N with A=5? Let's see: 5694 is the highest possible with A=5, because B=6, C=9, D=4. So, the next higher would have to be 5695, but D=5 isn't allowed since D≡4 mod7.

Wait, no, if D can be 4 or 11, but 11 is invalid. So, D=4.

So, N=5694 is the maximum with A=5.

But wait, let's check if another combination gives a higher N.

Wait, if A=5, B=6, C=2, D=4→N=5624, which is smaller than 5694.

So, 5694 is the maximum for A=5.

But let me check if A=5 is indeed the maximum possible. Since A=6,7,8,9 didn't work, 5 is the highest possible.

Wait, but perhaps when A=5, but B=6, C=9, D=4, giving N=5694.

Is there a way to get a higher N with a different A? For example, if A=5, but with B=6, C=9, D=4; but perhaps a higher N with A=5 and B=6, C=9, D=4 is the maximum. So, yes, 5694.

But wait, let's think again: perhaps N=5694 is the maximum, but maybe a higher N exists with a lower A but higher digits in B, C, D.

But since A is the thousands digit, which has the most weight, so a higher A would give a higher N, even if other digits are lower.

But in this case, higher A didn't work.

Wait, perhaps I missed something. Let me think: when A=9, we had B=4, C=3, D=0 or7. N=9430 or9437. But changing A to1 gives 1430 or1437, which were not divisible by7.

So, perhaps N=5694 is the answer. But let me check if A=5 is indeed the correct maximum.

Wait, another approach: perhaps N=8888 is invalid, but maybe N=8xxx where B, C, D are different. But how?

Wait, perhaps it's better to note that N=5694 is the maximum possible.

But wait, let me check N=5694 and see if any higher four-digit numbers with A=5 and higher digits in B, C, D satisfy the condition.

Wait, 5694 is the highest for A=5. Let's see N=5700: but that might not satisfy the conditions.

Alternatively, let's see if A=5, B=7 is possible. But wait, B must be ≡6 mod7, so B=6 or13. So, 7 is not allowed because 7≡0 mod7, which isn't 6.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that when A=5, we have N=5694, but maybe there's a higher N with A=5, but with different B, C, D.

Wait, but B is fixed at6, because B≡6 mod7, and B is a digit, so B can only be6 or13. 13 is invalid, so B=6.

Similarly, C=9 (since C≡2 mod7, and 9 is the higher digit) and D=4 (as D≡4 mod7, and 4 is the only digit allowed). So, N=5694 is indeed the maximum for A=5.

So, perhaps N=5694 is the maximum four-digit number with the given property.

But wait, let me make sure there isn't a higher N with A=5 but with different digits.

Wait, perhaps for A=5, can B be higher than6? For example, B=13 is invalid. So, no. So, B=6 is the maximum.

Similarly, C=9 is allowed because C≡2 mod7, and 9≡2 mod7.

And D=4 is allowed because D≡4 mod7.

So, N=5694 is the maximum.

But let me verify once more the modified numbers:

1. Replace A with1:1694 →1694 ÷7=242 → exactly divisible.

2. Replace B with1:5194 →5194 ÷7=742 → exactly divisible.

3. Replace C with1:5614 →5614 ÷7=802 → exactly divisible.

4. Replace D with1:5691 →5691 ÷7=813 → exactly divisible.

All four modified numbers are divisible by7. So, N=5694 satisfies the condition.

But wait, is there a higher N that also satisfies the condition?

Wait, perhaps N=5694 is not the highest.

Wait, what about N=5694 +1=5695? Let's see if that works.

But N=5695:

Check each modified number.

1. Replace A with1:1695.

1695 ÷7: 7*242=1694, 1695-1694=1 → remainder1. Not divisible.

So, N=5695 doesn't work.

Similarly, N=5694 is the maximum for A=5.

But let me check N=5694 and ensure that no higher four-digit number satisfies the condition.

Wait, perhaps another approach is needed. Since N=5694 works, but maybe a higher N exists with different digits.

Wait, perhaps if we have A=5, B=6, C=9, D=4, that's 5694.

Is there a way to make N higher by changing other digits? For example, if D can be higher than4.

Wait, no, because D must be ≡4 mod7, so next higher is11, which is invalid. So, D=4 is the only option.

Similarly, C is9, which is the highest possible for C≡2 mod7.

B is6, which is the highest possible for B≡6 mod7.

So, N=5694 is indeed the maximum.

Wait, but wait another moment. Let me think—what if N is 5694, but if I set D=4, but perhaps a different D is allowed? No, because D must be ≡4 mod7, so D=4 is the only digit.

So, N=5694 is the maximum.

Therefore, Q and R are the quotient and remainder when N is divided by1000.

So, N=5694 ÷1000=5 with remainder 694.

So, Q=5, R=694.

Therefore, Q + R =5 + 694=699.

Wait, but before finalizing, let me confirm that N=5694 is indeed the correct answer.

Wait, but earlier, when I tried A=8, I thought of N=8888, which didn't work, but perhaps another N with A=8 exists which works.

Wait, perhaps for A=8, let's find B, C, D such that all modified numbers are divisible by7.

Wait, let me try to compute N=8888.

As before, replacing A with1 gives1888. 1888 ÷7: 7*269=1883, 1888-1883=5→ remainder5. Not divisible.

So, N=8888 doesn't work.

Alternatively, maybe with A=8, but B, C, D different.

Wait, from earlier, for A=8:

B≡1 mod7, so B=1 or8.

C≡1 mod7, so C=1 or8.

D≡1 mod7, so D=1 or8.

So, let's try N=8181.

Check the modified numbers:

1. Replace A with1:1181.

1181 ÷7: 7*168=1176, 1181-1176=5→ remainder5. Not divisible.

Hmm. How about N=8118.

Replace A with1:1118.

1118 ÷7: 7*159=1113, 1118-1113=5→ remainder5. Not divisible.

Wait, maybe N=8811.

Replace A with1:1811.

1811 ÷7: 7*258=1806, 1811-1806=5→remainder5. Not divisible.

Hmm, seems like no matter what, when A=8, changing A to1 always gives a number not divisible by7.

Wait, let me check if 1BCD=1xxx is divisible by7.

For A=8:

We have B≡1 mod7, C≡1 mod7, D≡1 mod7.

So, 1BCD=1 1 1 1? No, because B, C, D can be1 or8.

Wait, if B=1, C=1, D=1: N=8111.

Replace A with1:1111.

1111 ÷7: 7*158=1106, 1111-1106=5→remainder5. Not divisible.

Alternatively, if B=8, C=8, D=8: N=8888.

Replace A with1:1888.

Which as before, gives remainder5.

So, yes, for A=8, any N will have 1BCD≡5 mod7, which isn't 0. So, A=8 is invalid.

Thus, the maximum possible N is 5694.

So, Q=5, R=694. Q + R=5 +694=699.

Wait, but let me double-check the division.

N=5694 ÷1000=5 with remainder 694. Yes.

So, Q + R=5 +694=699.

Thus, the final answer is 699.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To solve the problem, we need to find the greatest four-digit number \( N \) such that changing any one of its digits to 1 results in a number divisible by 7. We then need to find \( Q + R \) where \( Q \) and \( R \) are the quotient and remainder when \( N \) is divided by 1000.

1. **Representation of \( N \):** Let \( N = ABCD \) where \( A, B, C, D \) are its digits. The conditions imply that changing each digit to 1 yields a number divisible by 7.

2. **Modular Equations:** We derived four modular equations based on the conditions:
   - \( 3A - B \equiv 2 \mod 7 \)
   - \( 2B - 3C \equiv 6 \mod 7 \)
   - \( 3C - D \equiv 2 \mod 7 \)
   - \( 2B - D \equiv 1 \mod 7 \)

3. **Solving the Equations:** By solving these equations, we found:
   - \( B \equiv 3A - 2 \mod 7 \)
   - \( C \equiv 2A - 1 \mod 7 \)
   - \( D \equiv 6A - 5 \mod 7 \)

4. **Testing Values of \( A \):** We tested values of \( A \) from 9 downwards to find the largest \( N \) that satisfies all conditions. After testing \( A = 9, 8, 7, 6 \), we found that \( A = 5 \) yields \( N = 5694 \), which satisfies all conditions.

5. **Verification:** We verified that changing any digit of \( N = 5694 \) to 1 results in a number divisible by 7.

6. **Division by 1000:** Dividing \( N = 5694 \) by 1000 gives \( Q = 5 \) and \( R = 694 \).

7. **Final Result:** \( Q + R = 5 + 694 = 699 \).

Thus, the final answer is:

\boxed{699}
