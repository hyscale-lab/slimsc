Okay, so I have this math problem here about residents of Aimeville and the things they own. Let me try to figure it out step by step. 

First, the problem says there are 900 residents. Each resident owns a bag of candy hearts. So, that's a given for everyone. Then, some of them own other things: diamond rings, golf clubs, garden spades. Let me write down the numbers:

- Diamond ring owners: 195
- Golf clubs owners: 367
- Garden spade owners: 562

Also, every resident owns a bag of candy hearts. So, the candy hearts are like a universal set here—everyone has them.

Now, the problem also mentions that 437 residents own exactly two of these things, and 234 own exactly three. I'm supposed to find how many own all four—so those who have a diamond ring, golf clubs, garden spade, and candy hearts.

Hmm, okay. I think this is a problem about sets and Venn diagrams. Maybe using the principle of inclusion-exclusion? Let me recall that formula.

The inclusion-exclusion principle for four sets is a bit complicated, but I think the formula for the union of four sets is:

|A ∪ B ∪ C ∪ D| = |A| + |B| + |C| + |D| - |A∩B| - |A∩C| - |A∩D| - |B∩C| - |B∩D| - |C∩D| + |A∩B∩C| + |A∩B∩D| + |A∩C∩D| + |B∩C∩D| - |A∩B∩C∩D|

But wait, in this problem, everyone has a candy heart. So, D is the set of everyone, right? Because every resident owns the candy hearts. So, D is the universal set with 900 elements.

Wait, so maybe D is the same as the universal set. That might simplify things. So, in that case, any intersection involving D would just be the other set. For example, A ∩ D is just A, because D is everything. Similarly, A ∩ B ∩ D is just A ∩ B, etc.

But wait, that might not be entirely correct because D is the set of candy heart owners, which is all 900. So, yes, any intersection with D is just the other set. So, for example, |A ∩ D| = |A|, since A is a subset of D.

But then, let me think about the problem. Since D is the universal set, the total number of people in the union of A, B, C, D is just 900. Because everyone is in D, so the union is also 900.

Wait, so |A ∪ B ∪ C ∪ D| = 900, because D is everything.

So, applying the inclusion-exclusion formula:

|A ∪ B ∪ C ∪ D| = |A| + |B| + |C| + |D| - |A∩B| - |A∩C| - |A∩D| - |B∩C| - |B∩D| - |C∩D| + |A∩B∩C| + |A∩B∩D| + |A∩C∩D| + |B∩C∩D| - |A∩B∩C∩D|

But since |A ∪ B ∪ C ∪ D| = 900, and |D| is 900 as well.

Let me substitute:

900 = |A| + |B| + |C| + 900 - (|A∩B| + |A∩C| + |A∩D| + |B∩C| + |B∩D| + |C∩D|) + (|A∩B∩C| + |A∩B∩D| + |A∩C∩D| + |B∩C∩D|) - |A∩B∩C∩D|

Hmm, this looks a bit messy, but maybe I can rearrange terms. Let's subtract 900 from both sides:

0 = |A| + |B| + |C| - (|A∩B| + |A∩C| + |A∩D| + |B∩C| + |B∩D| + |C∩D|) + (|A∩B∩C| + |A∩B∩D| + |A∩C∩D| + |B∩C∩D|) - |A∩B∩C∩D|

That's a bit complicated. Maybe I can find another approach.

Wait, the problem gives me the number of people owning exactly two things and exactly three things. Let me use that information.

Let me denote:

- Let x be the number of people who own all four things: diamond ring, golf clubs, garden spade, and candy hearts. So, x = |A ∩ B ∩ C ∩ D|.

But since D is the universal set, x = |A ∩ B ∩ C|, because D is everyone. Wait, no, because A, B, C are subsets of D. So, yes, A ∩ B ∩ C ∩ D is the same as A ∩ B ∩ C, because D includes everyone.

Wait, but in the problem, the total is 900. So, maybe I can think about the total number of people in each category.

Let me recall that in such problems, the total number of elements is the sum of people owning exactly one thing, exactly two things, exactly three things, and exactly four things.

Wait, in this case, the problem says that 437 own exactly two things, and 234 own exactly three. But it doesn't mention exactly one or exactly four. Hmm.

Wait, but all residents own at least the candy hearts. So, no one owns zero things. So, everyone owns at least one thing.

So, the total is:

Number of people owning exactly 1 thing + exactly 2 + exactly 3 + exactly 4.

But the problem doesn't give us the numbers for exactly 1 or exactly 4. So, we need to find x, which is the number of people owning exactly four.

Wait, but maybe I can find the number of people owning exactly one thing, and then use that to find x.

Alternatively, perhaps using the inclusion-exclusion principle in a different way.

Wait, let me think about the counts. Let me denote:

- a = number of people with exactly 1 thing.
- b = exactly 2 things: given as 437.
- c = exactly 3 things: given as 234.
- d = exactly 4 things: which is x.

So, the total number of people is a + b + c + d = 900.

But I don't know a or d. So, maybe I can find another equation.

Another approach is to consider the sum of all the ownerships. Let's see.

Each person owning exactly 1 thing contributes 1 to the total count.

Each person owning exactly 2 contributes 2.

Exactly 3: contributes 3.

Exactly 4: contributes 4.

So, the total sum of all ownerships is: a * 1 + b * 2 + c * 3 + d * 4.

But I can compute this sum in another way: the sum of the sizes of each set. Because each set counts all the people who own that item, regardless of how many other items they own.

So, for the diamond ring owners: |A| = 195.

Golf clubs: |B| = 367.

Garden spade: |C| = 562.

Candy hearts: |D| = 900.

But wait, the candy hearts are universal, so everyone is counted in D. So, the sum of all ownerships would be |A| + |B| + |C| + |D|.

Let me compute that:

195 + 367 + 562 + 900.

Let me add them step by step:

195 + 367 = 562.

562 + 562 = 1124.

1124 + 900 = 2024.

So, the total ownership is 2024.

But this must equal the sum from the individual counts: a + 2b + 3c + 4d.

So:

a + 2b + 3c + 4d = 2024.

We also have from the total people:

a + b + c + d = 900.

So, now we have two equations:

1. a + b + c + d = 900

2. a + 2b + 3c + 4d = 2024

Let me subtract equation 1 from equation 2 to eliminate a:

( a + 2b + 3c +4d ) - (a + b + c + d ) = 2024 - 900

Simplify:

0a + (2b - b) + (3c - c) + (4d - d) = 1124

So:

b + 2c + 3d = 1124

We know that b is 437, c is 234, and d is x. Let me plug those in:

437 + 2*234 + 3x = 1124

Calculate 2*234: 468.

So:

437 + 468 + 3x = 1124

437 + 468 = let's compute: 400+400=800, 37+68=105. So, 800 + 105 = 905.

So, 905 +3x = 1124

Subtract 905 from both sides:

3x = 1124 - 905 = 219

So, 3x = 219 → x = 219 /3 = 73.

So, x is 73. That would be the number of people who own all four things.

Wait, let me double-check my calculations.

Compute 437 + 2*234:

2*234 = 468.

437 + 468:

400 + 400 = 800.

37 + 68 = 105.

Total: 905.

Then, 1124 - 905 = 219.

219 divided by 3 is 73.

Yes, that seems correct.

So, the answer is 73.

To solve the problem, we use the principle of inclusion-exclusion and the given data about ownership of items in Aimeville.

1. **Define Variables:**
   - Let \( a \) be the number of residents owning exactly one item.
   - Let \( b = 437 \) be the number owning exactly two items.
   - Let \( c = 234 \) be the number owning exactly three items.
   - Let \( d = x \) be the number owning all four items.

2. **Total Population Equation:**
   \[
   a + b + c + d = 900
   \]

3. **Total Ownership Count:**
   Each resident contributes to the count based on the number of items they own. The total ownership count is the sum of the sizes of each set:
   \[
   |A| + |B| + |C| + |D| = 195 + 367 + 562 + 900 = 2024
   \]
   This can also be expressed as:
   \[
   a \cdot 1 + b \cdot 2 + c \cdot 3 + d \cdot 4 = 2024
   \]

4. **Set Up Equations:**
   From the total population:
   \[
   a + 437 + 234 + x = 900 \quad \Rightarrow \quad a + x = 229
   \]
   From the total ownership:
   \[
   a + 2(437) + 3(234) + 4x = 2024
   \]
   Simplify:
   \[
   a + 874 + 702 + 4x = 2024 \quad \Rightarrow \quad a + 4x = 448
   \]

5. **Solve the System:**
   Subtract the first equation (\( a + x = 229 \)) from the second (\( a + 4x = 448 \)):
   \[
   (a + 4x) - (a + x) = 448 - 229 \quad \Rightarrow \quad 3x = 219 \quad \Rightarrow \quad x = 73
   \]

Thus, the number of residents who own all four items is \(\boxed{73}\).
