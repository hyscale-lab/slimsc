Okay, so I need to solve this math problem where I have to find the least prime number p such that there's a positive integer n where n⁴ + 1 is divisible by p². Then, I need to find the smallest m such that m⁴ + 1 is divisible by p². Hmm, that sounds a bit challenging, but let me try to break it down.

First, let me understand the problem. I'm looking for the smallest prime p where p² divides n⁴ + 1 for some n. Once I find that p, I need the smallest m where m⁴ + 1 is divisible by p².

I remember that for primes, if p divides n⁴ + 1, then n⁸ ≡ 1 mod p. That's because (n⁴)² ≡ (-1)² ≡ 1 mod p. So the order of n modulo p must divide 8. But since n⁴ ≡ -1 mod p, the order can't be 1, 2, or 4 because that would imply n⁴ ≡ 1 mod p, which contradicts n⁴ ≡ -1. So the order must be 8. That means 8 divides p-1, so p ≡ 1 mod 8.

Wait, primes that are 1 mod 8 are primes where 8 divides p-1. So the smallest such primes are 17, 97, etc. But wait, is 17 the smallest? Let me check primes in order: 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17. So 17 is the first prime where p ≡ 1 mod 8.

But wait, does 2 work? Let's check. For p=2, n⁴ +1. Let me see: n can be 1: 1 +1=2, which is divisible by 2, but 2²=4. Is 2 divisible by 4? No. So n=1 gives 2, which is 2^1, not 2². What about n=2: 16 +1=17, which is not divisible by 4. Similarly, n=3: 81 +1=82, which is 2×41, still not divisible by 4. So p=2 doesn't work because n⁴ +1 is only divisible by 2 once, not squared.

Similarly, check p=5. For p=5, let's see if there's an n such that n⁴ ≡ -1 mod 5. Let me compute n⁴ mod 5 for n=1,2,3,4.

n=1: 1^4=1 mod5
n=2: 16 mod5=1
n=3:81 mod5=1
n=4: 256 mod5=1
So n⁴ ≡ 1 mod5 for any n coprime to 5. So n⁴ ≡1, so n⁴ +1 ≡2 mod5. So 5 doesn't divide n⁴ +1 at all, so p=5 is out.

Similarly, let's check p=3. n⁴ mod3. Let's compute n=1:1, n=2:16 mod3=1. So n⁴ ≡1 mod3. So n⁴ +1 ≡2 mod3, so 3 doesn't divide n⁴ +1. So p=3 is out.

Next, p=7. Let's compute n⁴ mod7.

n=1:1
n=2:16 mod7=2
n=3:81 mod7=81-11*7=81-77=4
n=4:256 mod7. 7*36=252, 256-252=4, so 4.
n=5:625 mod7. 7*89=623, so 625-623=2.
n=6:1296 mod7. 7*185=1295, so 1.

So n⁴ mod7 is 1,2,4,4,2,1 for n=1,2,3,4,5,6.

So n⁴ can be 1,2,4 mod7. So n⁴ +1 can be 2,3,5 mod7. None of these are 0 mod7, so 7 doesn't divide n⁴ +1. So p=7 is out.

Next, p=13. Let's see. Maybe I should check primes in order after 2,3,5,7,11,13. Let me check p=13.

Compute n⁴ mod13. Let me compute n from 1 to 12.

n=1:1
n=2:16 mod13=3
n=3:81 mod13. 13*6=78, so 81-78=3
n=4:256 mod13. 13*19=247, 256-247=9
n=5:625 mod13. 13*48=624, so 1
n=6:1296 mod13. 13*99=1287, 1296-1287=9
n=7:2401 mod13. Let me compute 2401/13: 13*184=2392, 2401-2392=9
n=8:4096 mod13. 13*315=4095, 4096-4095=1
n=9:6561 mod13. 13*504=6552, 6561-6552=9
n=10:10000 mod13. Let's compute 10^4=10000. 10 mod13=10, 10^2=100≡9 mod13, 10^4=9²=81≡3 mod13.
n=11:14641 mod13. 11 mod13=11, 11²=121≡4, 11^4=4²=16≡3 mod13.
n=12:12^4 mod13. 12≡-1, so (-1)^4=1 mod13.

So n⁴ mod13 is:

1:1
2:3
3:3
4:9
5:1
6:9
7:9
8:1
9:9
10:3
11:3
12:1

So the possible residues are 1,3,9.

Thus, n⁴ + 1 mod13 can be 2,4,10. None are 0, so 13 doesn't divide n⁴ +1.

Next prime is 17. Let's check p=17.

I need to see if there's an n for which n⁴ ≡ -1 mod17. So n⁴ ≡16 mod17.

Let me compute n^4 mod17 for n=1 to 16.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to note that since 17 ≡1 mod8, the multiplicative group mod17 is cyclic of order 16. So the equation x^8 ≡1 mod17.

Wait, since n^8 ≡1 mod17, as 16 divides 16 (the order of the group). So n^8≡1 for all n coprime to 17.

But we have n^4 ≡-1 mod17. Then (n^4)^2 ≡1 mod17, so n^8≡1, which is consistent.

So let's see if there's an n where n^4 ≡-1 mod17.

Let me compute n^4 mod17 for n from 1 to 8 (since beyond that it repeats due to symmetry).

n=1:1
n=2:16 (since 2^4=16)
n=3:81 mod17. 17*4=68, 81-68=13
n=4:256 mod17. 17*15=255, so 1.
n=5:625 mod17. Let's compute 17*36=612, 625-612=13
n=6:1296 mod17. 17*76=1292, 1296-1292=4
n=7:2401 mod17. 17*141=2397, 2401-2397=4
n=8:4096 mod17. 17*241=4097, so 4096≡-1 mod17.

Wait, n=8: 8^4=4096. 4096 divided by 17: 17*241=4097, so 4096≡-1 mod17. So yes, n=8 satisfies n^4 ≡-1 mod17.

So p=17 is the least prime where p² divides n⁴ +1 for some n. Because for all smaller primes, we saw that n⁴ +1 isn't divisible by them, or if it is, not by p².

Wait, but I should check whether for p=17, does n=8 satisfy n⁴ +1 ≡0 mod17²?

Because p=17 is a candidate, but we need to confirm if 17² divides 8⁴ +1.

Compute 8^4: 8^2=64, so 8^4=64^2=4096. Now, 4096 +1=4097.

Check if 4097 is divisible by 17²=289.

Compute 289*14=4046. 4097-4046=51. 51 is less than 289. So 4097=289*14 +51. So 4097 mod289=51≠0. So 17² does not divide 8⁴ +1.

Hmm, so p=17 doesn't work because although 17 divides 8⁴ +1, 17² doesn't. So I need to look for a higher prime.

Wait, maybe I need to find a prime p where n⁴ ≡-1 mod p² for some n. So perhaps p=17 isn't the one because even though it works mod17, it doesn't mod289.

So let's see. So maybe p=101 or another prime. Wait, but p needs to be the least such prime where p² divides n⁴ +1 for some n.

So perhaps I need to look for primes where -1 is a quartic residue mod p². I remember that for primes p≡1 mod8, -1 is a quartic residue mod p. But does it lift to mod p²?

I think Hensel's lemma might be useful here. Hensel's lemma says that if f(n)≡0 mod p and f'(n) not ≡0 mod p, then there's a unique lift mod p².

In this case, f(n)=n⁴ +1. So f'(n)=4n³.

At n=8 mod17, f(n)≡0 mod17, and f'(8)=4*8³=4*512=2048. 2048 mod17: 17*120=2040, 2048-2040=8. So f'(8)≡8 mod17. Since 8≡8≠0 mod17, the derivative is non-zero mod17. So by Hensel's lemma, there's a unique lift of n=8 mod17 to a solution mod17².

So that means there exists an n such that n≡8 mod17 and n⁴ ≡-1 mod17². So p=17 is the prime we're looking for. But earlier, when I computed 8⁴ +1=4097, which is 17*241. So 4097 mod17² is 4097 mod289=51, as I saw before. But since n=8 is a solution mod17, Hensel's lemma tells us there's a unique solution mod17², which is n=8 +17*k for some k. So let me compute what k should be.

Let me let n =8 +17k. Then n⁴ +1 ≡0 mod17².

Compute n⁴ mod17².

First, compute n =8 +17k. Let's compute n²: (8 +17k)² =64 + 2*8*17k + (17k)^2=64 + 272k + 289k². Since we're working mod17²=289, terms with 289k² vanish. So n² ≡64 +272k mod289.

Similarly, compute n⁴=(n²)^2: (64 +272k)^2.

Compute 64²=4096.

2*64*272k=2*64*272*k. Let me compute 64*272= (64*200)+(64*72)=12800 +4608=17408. 2*17408=34816. So 34816k.

Then (272k)^2=73984k², but mod289, this is 73984 mod289.

Wait, 289*256=73984, so 73984k²≡0 mod289.

So putting it all together, n⁴ ≡4096 +34816k mod289.

Now, compute 4096 mod289. Let's compute 289*14=4046. 4096-4046=50. So 4096≡50 mod289.

Similarly, 34816 mod289. Let's compute 289*120=34680. 34816-34680=136. So 34816k ≡136k mod289.

So n⁴ ≡50 +136k mod289.

We want n⁴ ≡-1 mod289, which is 288 mod289.

So 50 +136k ≡288 mod289 → 136k ≡238 mod289.

We can write 136k ≡238 mod289.

Let me solve for k.

First, find the inverse of 136 mod289.

Compute gcd(136,289). 289 ÷136=2*136=272, remainder 17.
136 ÷17=8, remainder 0. So gcd is17. Wait, but 136 and 289 have a common divisor of17. So 136 and289 are not coprime. So the equation 136k ≡238 mod289 may not have a solution unless 17 divides 238.

Compute 238 ÷17: 17*14=238. Yes, 17 divides 238. So we can divide the entire equation by17.

136/17=8, 238/17=14, 289/17=17.

So the equation becomes 8k ≡14 mod17.

Now, solve 8k ≡14 mod17.

Find the inverse of8 mod17. 8*2=16≡-1 mod17, so 8*(-2)=1 mod17 → inverse is 15 (since -2 mod17=15).

So k≡14*15 mod17. 14*15=210. 210 ÷17: 17*12=204, remainder6. So k≡6 mod17.

So k=6 +17m for some integer m.

But since we're solving mod17², the solution for k is k=6 mod17, so the minimal k is6.

Thus, n=8 +17*6=8+102=110.

Wait, wait. Let me check that.

Wait, n=8 +17k. We found that k=6 mod17, so the minimal positive k is6.

So n=8+17*6=8+102=110.

Now, let's compute 110⁴ +1 mod17².

But that's a bit time-consuming, but perhaps I can compute 110 mod17²=289.

Wait, 110 is less than289, so 110 is itself.

Compute 110²=12100.

12100 mod289: Let's compute 289*41=11849. 12100-11849=251.

So 110²≡251 mod289.

Then 110⁴=(110²)²=251² mod289.

Compute 251²: 251*251. Let's compute 250²=62500, plus 2*250*1=500, plus1²=1. So (250+1)^2=62500+500+1=63001.

Now, 63001 ÷289: Let's find how many times 289 goes into 63001.

Compute 289*200=57800. 63001-57800=5201.

289*17=4913. 5201-4913=288.

So 63001=289*(200+17)+288=289*217 +288.

So 251²≡288 mod289.

Thus, 110⁴=251²≡288 mod289.

So 110⁴ +1 ≡288 +1=289≡0 mod289.

Yes! So 110⁴ +1 is divisible by17²=289.

So p=17 is indeed the least prime for which p² divides n⁴ +1 for some n.

Now, the second part is to find the least positive integer m such that m⁴ +1 is divisible by17²=289. So I need the smallest m where m⁴ ≡-1 mod289.

From earlier, we found that n=110 is a solution, but perhaps there's a smaller m.

Since 110 is a solution, but maybe a smaller positive integer exists.

We can note that in mod289, solutions to n⁴ ≡-1 mod289 will be congruent to 110 mod something. Let me think about the structure.

We can consider the multiplicative order. Since 17²=289, the multiplicative group mod289 has order 289-1=288=16*18=16*2*9=32*9.

We know that n^4 ≡-1 mod289, so n^8≡1 mod289. So the order of n must divide 8.

Wait, but n^4 ≡-1 implies that the order is 8.

So the multiplicative order of n modulo289 is8. So the order of the multiplicative group is288, which is divisible by8, so such elements exist.

The number of solutions is given by the number of elements of order8 in the multiplicative group, which is φ(8)=4, so there are four solutions.

We found n=110. Are there smaller solutions?

We can try to find the smallest m>0 such that m⁴ ≡-1 mod289.

We can check m=10:

10^4=10000. 10000 ÷289: 289*34=9826. 10000-9826=174. So 10^4≡174 mod289≠288.

m=22: 22^4=(22²)^2=484². 484 mod289: 289*1=289, 484-289=195. So 484≡195 mod289.

195²=38025. 38025 ÷289: 289*131=38059. 38025-38059=-34≡255 mod289. So 195²≡255 mod289. So 22^4≡255≠288.

m=24: 24^4. 24²=576. 576 mod289: 289*1=289, 576-289=287≡-2 mod289.

Then, (-2)^2=4 mod289. So 24^4≡4 mod289≠288.

m=34: 34^4. 34²=1156. 1156 mod289: 289*4=1156. So 1156≡0 mod289. So 34^4≡0 mod289. Not good.

m=40: 40²=1600. 1600 mod289: 289*5=1445. 1600-1445=155. 155²=24025. 24025 ÷289: 289*83=24047. 24025-24047=-22≡267 mod289. So 40^4≡267≠288.

m=50: 50²=2500. 2500 mod289: 289*8=2312. 2500-2312=188. 188²=35344. 35344 mod289: Let's compute 289*122=289*120 +289*2=34680 +578=35258. 35344-35258=86. So 50^4≡86 mod289.

Hmm, not 288.

m=60: 60²=3600. 3600 mod289: 289*12=3468. 3600-3468=132. 132²=17424. 17424 ÷289: 289*60=17340. 17424-17340=84. So 60^4≡84 mod289.

Still not.

m=70: 70²=4900. 4900 mod289: 289*16=4624. 4900-4624=276. 276²=76176. 76176 ÷289: 289*263=76147. 76176-76147=29. So 70^4≡29 mod289.

No.

m=80: 80²=6400. 6400 mod289: 289*22=6358. 6400-6358=42. 42²=1764. 1764 ÷289: 289*6=1734. 1764-1734=30. So 80^4≡30 mod289.

Hmm, not 288.

Wait, maybe I should approach this differently. Since n=110 is a solution, but maybe there's a smaller solution. Since the multiplicative group mod289 is cyclic of order288, and the solutions to x^4 ≡-1 are the elements of order8. The number of such elements is φ(8)=4, so four solutions.

Given that n=110 is one solution, the others would be 110, 110*3, 110*9, 110*27 mod289? Wait, no, because in a cyclic group of order288, the elements of order8 are the generators raised to exponents that are multiples of 288/8=36. So the elements would be g^{36*k} for k=1,2,3,4, where g is a primitive root.

Wait, but perhaps it's better to note that the solutions to x^4 ≡-1 mod289 are the same as x^8 ≡1 mod289, but x^4≡-1, so the order is8.

So the four solutions would be 110, 110*3, 110*9, 110*27, but wait, 3^4=81≡81 mod289, but maybe I'm complicating things.

Alternatively, perhaps I can compute 110 mod289 is 110, but perhaps 110-289= -179, which is equivalent to 110 mod289. But that's negative, so perhaps the smallest positive is 110.

Alternatively, maybe 110 is the smallest positive solution. Let's check m=10: 10^4=10000 mod289=174. Not 288.

m=22: 22^4=234256 mod289=255.

m=34: 34^4=1336336 mod289=0.

m=46: 46²=2116. 2116 mod289: 289*7=2023. 2116-2023=93. 93²=8649. 8649 ÷289=29*289=8381, 8649-8381=268. So 46^4≡268 mod289.

m=58: 58²=3364. 3364 ÷289=11*289=3179, 3364-3179=185. 185²=34225. 34225 ÷289=118*289=34162, 34225-34162=63. So 58^4≡63 mod289.

m=70: earlier was29.

m=82: 82²=6724. 6724 ÷289: 289*23=6647, 6724-6647=77. 77²=5929. 5929 ÷289=20*289=5780, 5929-5780=149. So 82^4≡149 mod289.

m=94: 94²=8836. 8836 ÷289=30*289=8670, 8836-8670=166. 166²=27556. 27556 ÷289=95*289=27455, 27556-27455=101. So 94^4≡101 mod289.

Hmm, not 288. Maybe I should try m=110. Wait, 110 is a solution, but perhaps a smaller one exists. Alternatively, maybe 110 is the smallest.

Alternatively, perhaps m=10 is too small, but let me check m=110. 110 is the solution we found earlier, but perhaps there's a smaller m.

Alternatively, perhaps we can find m by considering that 110 ≡8 mod17. So perhaps m=8 is a solution mod17, but not mod289. But we saw that 8⁴ +1=4097≡51 mod289≠0.

Wait, perhaps I can find a solution less than110.

Wait, let me think. In the group mod289, the solutions to x^4 ≡-1 are the four elements of order8. So the four solutions would be x, x*3, x*9, x*27 mod289, where x is the smallest positive solution. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the four solutions are 110, 110*3=330≡330-289=41 mod289, 110*9=990≡990-3*289=990-867=123 mod289, and 110*27=2970≡2970-10*289=2970-2890=80 mod289.

Wait, let's compute 110*3 mod289: 110*3=330. 330-289=41. So 41 is another solution.

Check if 41⁴ +1 is divisible by289.

Compute 41²=1681. 1681 mod289: 289*5=1445. 1681-1445=236.

41⁴=(41²)²=236²=55696. 55696 ÷289: Let's compute 289*192=289*(200-8)=289*200=57800, minus 289*8=2312 → 57800-2312=55488. 55696-55488=208. So 41⁴≡208 mod289. 208 +1=209≡209≠0 mod289. So that can't be right. Did I make a mistake?

Wait, maybe I should compute 41⁴ mod289 more carefully.

41²=1681. 1681 mod289: 289*5=1445. 1681-1445=236.

Then 41⁴=(41²)²=236². 236²=55696. Now, compute 55696 mod289.

Let me compute how many times 289 goes into 55696.

Compute 289*192=289*(200-8)=289*200=57800; 289*8=2312. So 57800-2312=55488.

55696-55488=208. So 41⁴≡208 mod289.

208 +1=209≡209 mod289≠0. So 41⁴ +1≡209 mod289≠0. So that's not a solution. Hmm, so perhaps my earlier approach is wrong.

Wait, maybe the four solutions are more scattered. Alternatively, perhaps my initial assumption that multiplying by3 gives another solution is incorrect.

Alternatively, perhaps I should note that in the multiplicative group mod289, which is cyclic of order288, the solutions to x^4 ≡-1 are the elements of order8, as -1 has order2, and x^4=-1 implies x^8=1.

So the number of solutions is φ(8)=4.

So perhaps the four solutions are 110, 110*3^k mod289, for k=0,1,2,3.

Wait, let me compute 110*3 mod289=330, which is 330-289=41.

110*9=990 mod289: 289*3=867, 990-867=123.

110*27=2970 mod289: Let's compute 289*10=2890, 2970-2890=80. So 80.

So the four solutions are110,41,123,80.

Wait, let me check 80. 80⁴ +1 mod289.

Compute 80²=6400 mod289: 289*22=6358, 6400-6358=42.

80⁴=(80²)^2=42²=1764 mod289: 289*6=1734, 1764-1734=30. So 80⁴≡30 mod289. 30+1=31≠0. So that's not a solution.

Hmm, perhaps my assumption is wrong. Maybe the four solutions are 110, 110*3, 110*9, 110*27, but when I computed 41 and 123, they don't satisfy the condition. So perhaps I'm making a mistake in assuming that multiplying by3 gives another solution. Alternatively, perhaps the solutions are 110, 110*3^1, 110*3^2, 110*3^3, but that doesn't seem to work.

Alternatively, perhaps I should note that in the multiplicative group, the solutions are the generators raised to exponents that are 36*k, since 288/8=36. So, if g is a primitive root mod289, then the solutions are g^{36}, g^{72}, g^{108}, g^{144}.

But without knowing a primitive root, it's hard to proceed.

Alternatively, perhaps I can try m=110, 80, 41, 123, etc., and see which is the smallest.

We saw that 110 is a solution, but 80 isn't. 41: when I checked 41⁴≡208 mod289, which +1=209≠0.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation for 41⁴.

Let me recalculate 41⁴ mod289.

41²=1681. 1681 ÷289=5*289=1445. 1681-1445=236. So 41²≡236 mod289.

Then, 41⁴=(41²)²=236²=55696. Now, compute 55696 ÷289.

Compute 289*192=289*(200-8)=57800-2312=55488.

55696-55488=208. So 236²≡208 mod289. Thus, 41⁴≡208 mod289. 208+1=209≠0 mod289. So 41 isn't a solution.

Wait, perhaps I'm miscalculating. Let me try m=110.

110²=12100. 12100 ÷289: 289*41=11849. 12100-11849=251. So 110²≡251 mod289.

Then 110⁴=(251)^2=63001. Compute 63001 ÷289.

Compute 289*217=289*(200+17)=57800 +4913=62713.

63001-62713=288. So 251²≡288 mod289. Thus, 110⁴≡288 mod289, so 110⁴ +1≡289≡0 mod289. So 110 is a solution.

What about m=80? 80²=6400 mod289: 289*22=6358, 6400-6358=42. So 80²≡42 mod289.

80⁴=42²=1764 mod289: 289*6=1734, 1764-1734=30. So 80⁴≡30 mod289. 30+1=31≠0. So not a solution.

Wait, maybe m=110 is the smallest solution.

Alternatively, perhaps I can find a smaller m by checking numbers less than110.

Let me check m=40:

40²=1600. 1600 mod289: 289*5=1445, 1600-1445=155. 155²=24025. 24025 ÷289=83*289=24047. 24025-24047=-22≡267 mod289. So 40⁴≡267 mod289. Not 288.

m=50: 50²=2500. 2500 mod289: 289*8=2312, 2500-2312=188. 188²=35344. 35344 ÷289: 289*122=35258, 35344-35258=86. So 50⁴≡86 mod289.

m=60: 60²=3600. 3600 mod289=3600-12*289=3600-3468=132. 132²=17424. 17424 mod289: 289*60=17340, 17424-17340=84. So 60⁴≡84 mod289.

m=70: 70²=4900. 4900 mod289=4900-16*289=4900-4624=276. 276²=76176. 76176 ÷289=263*289=76147, 76176-76147=29. So 70⁴≡29 mod289.

m=80: as before, 30.

m=90: 90²=8100. 8100 mod289: 289*27=7803, 8100-7803=297. 297 mod289=8. So 90²≡8 mod289. 8²=64. So 90⁴≡64 mod289. 64+1=65≠0.

m=100: 100²=10000. 10000 mod289: 289*34=9826, 10000-9826=174. 174²=30276. 30276 ÷289=104*289=30056, 30276-30056=220. So 100⁴≡220 mod289.

m=105: 105²=11025. 11025 mod289: 289*38=10982, 11025-10982=43. 43²=1849. 1849 mod289: 289*6=1734, 1849-1734=115. So 105⁴≡115 mod289.

Hmm, not 288.

m=106: 106²=11236. 11236 mod289: 289*38=10982, 11236-10982=254. 254²=64516. 64516 ÷289: 289*223=64527, which is larger than64516, so 222*289=64278, 64516-64278=238. So 106⁴≡238 mod289. 238 +1=239≠0.

m=107: 107²=11449. 11449 mod289: 289*39=11271, 11449-11271=178. 178²=31684. 31684 ÷289: 289*109=31501, 31684-31501=183. So 107⁴≡183 mod289.

m=108: 108²=11664. 11664 mod289: 289*40=11560, 11664-11560=104. 104²=10816. 10816 mod289: 289*37=10693, 10816-10693=123. So 108⁴≡123 mod289.

m=109: 109²=11881. 11881 mod289: 289*41=11849, 11881-11849=32. 32²=1024. 1024 mod289: 289*3=867, 1024-867=157. So 109⁴≡157 mod289.

m=110: As before, 110⁴≡288 mod289. So 110 is a solution.

So from m=1 to m=110, the smallest m where m⁴ +1≡0 mod289 is m=110.

Wait, but earlier I thought m=8 was a solution mod17, but not mod289. But maybe there's a smaller m than110 that works. Alternatively, perhaps 110 is indeed the minimal.

Wait, wait. Let me think again. When I used Hensel's lemma, I found that the solution lifts from n=8 mod17 to n=8 +17*6=110 mod289. So 110 is the unique solution congruent to8 mod17. But perhaps there are other solutions not congruent to8 mod17. For example, maybe n=110 is the only solution in the range 1 to110, but I'm not sure.

Wait, but in the multiplicative group mod289, which is cyclic of order288, the solutions to x^4≡-1 are the four elements of order8. So perhaps the four solutions are 110, 110*3, 110*3², 110*3³ mod289.

Let me compute 110*3=330≡330-289=41.

110*3²=110*9=990≡990-3*289=990-867=123.

110*3³=110*27=2970≡2970-10*289=2970-2890=80.

So the four solutions are110,41,123,80.

We checked 41 and80, and they didn't work. So perhaps my earlier calculation was wrong.

Wait, let me recheck 123.

Compute 123²=15129. 15129 mod289: 289*52=15028, 15129-15028=101. 101²=10201. 10201 mod289: 289*35=10115, 10201-10115=86. So 123⁴≡86 mod289. 86+1=87≠0. So not a solution.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in my approach. Alternatively, perhaps the four solutions are 110, 41, 123, 80, but none of them except110 satisfy m⁴ +1≡0 mod289.

Wait, that can't be right because I know that there are four solutions. So perhaps I made a mistake in my calculations for 41 and80.

Wait, let me compute 41⁴ again.

41²=1681. 1681 mod289: 289*5=1445, 1681-1445=236.

Then, 41⁴=(236)^2=55696. Now, compute 55696 mod289:

Compute 289*192=55488. 55696-55488=208.

So 41⁴≡208 mod289. 208+1=209≡209 mod289≠0.

Hmm, same as before. So 41 isn't a solution.

What about 123?

123²=15129. 15129 mod289: Let's compute 289*52=15028, so 15129-15028=101.

101²=10201. 10201 mod289: 289*35=10115, 10201-10115=86.

So 123⁴≡86 mod289. 86+1=87≡87 mod289≠0.

Similarly, 80²=6400 mod289=42. 42²=1764 mod289=30. 80⁴≡30 mod289. 30+1=31≡31 mod289≠0.

So that leaves only110 as a solution. That can't be right because there should be four solutions.

Wait, perhaps my initial assumption about the solutions is incorrect. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the Hensel's step.

Wait, going back, when I applied Hensel's lemma, I found that n=8 mod17 lifts to n=110 mod289. But perhaps the multiplicative group has more solutions.

Alternatively, perhaps I can find another solution by taking a different lift. For example, perhaps n=8 +17k for a different k.

Wait, no, Hensel's lemma says that if f'(n)≠0 mod p, which it isn't in this case, then the lift is unique mod p². So there should only be one solution congruent to8 mod17. But in the multiplicative group, there are four solutions, so there must be others not congruent to8 mod17.

Alternatively, perhaps I should find another starting point. For example, maybe another n that satisfies n^4≡-1 mod17.

Wait, earlier, when I computed n^4 mod17, I found that n=8 mod17 was a solution. Are there others?

Let me check n=15 mod17. 15≡-2. (-2)^4=16≡-1 mod17. So yes, n=15 mod17 is another solution.

So perhaps I can apply Hensel's lemma to n=15 mod17.

So let's compute n=15 +17k such that n⁴ ≡-1 mod289.

Compute f(n)=n⁴ +1.

f(15)=15⁴ +1=50625 +1=50626.

50626 mod17²=289: 289*175=50575, 50626-50575=51. So 50626≡51 mod289≠0.

Now, compute f'(15)=4*15³=4*3375=13500. 13500 mod17. 17*794=13500-17*794=13500-13500+17*0=0? Wait, 17*794=13500- no, 17*794=17*(700+94)=11900 + 1598=13498. 13500-13498=2. So f'(15)≡2 mod17≠0. So Hensel's lemma applies, and there's a unique lift mod289.

So let's solve for n=15 +17k such that n⁴ ≡-1 mod289.

Compute n=15 +17k.

Compute n²=(15 +17k)²=225 + 2*15*17k + (17k)^2=225 + 510k +289k²≡225 +510k mod289.

Since 510 mod289: 289*1=289, 510-289=221. So 510k≡221k mod289.

So n²≡225 +221k mod289.

Then, n⁴=(n²)^2=(225 +221k)^2=225² + 2*225*221k + (221k)^2.

Compute each term mod289:

225²=50625. 50625 mod289: 289*175=50575, 50625-50575=50.

2*225*221k=2*225*221*k. Compute 225*221 mod289.

Compute 225 mod289=225, 221 mod289=221.

225*221: Let's compute 225*200=45000, 225*21=4725. Total 45000+4725=49725.

49725 mod289: Let's find how many times 289 fits into49725.

Compute 289*172=289*(170+2)=289*170=49130, 289*2=578. So 49130+578=49708.

49725-49708=17. So 225*221≡17 mod289.

So 2*225*221k≡2*17k=34k mod289.

Lastly, (221k)^2=48841k² mod289. Compute 48841 mod289.

Compute 289*169=289*(170-1)=289*170=49130, 49130-289=48841. So 48841≡0 mod289.

So n⁴≡50 +34k mod289.

We want n⁴≡-1 mod289→50 +34k≡288 mod289→34k≡238 mod289.

Solve 34k≡238 mod289.

Find the inverse of34 mod289.

Compute gcd(34,289). 289=34*8 +17.

34=17*2 +0. So gcd is17. Check if17 divides238. 238 ÷17=14. Yes.

So divide equation by17: 34/17=2, 238/17=14, 289/17=17.

So equation becomes 2k≡14 mod17.

Solve 2k≡14 mod17→k≡7 mod17.

So k=7 +17m.

Thus, n=15 +17*7=15 +119=134.

So n=134 mod289.

Check 134⁴ +1 mod289.

Compute 134 mod289=134.

134²=17956. 17956 mod289: 289*62=17978, which is larger than17956, so 289*61=17629, 17956-17629=327. 327-289=38. So 134²≡38 mod289.

134⁴=(38)^2=1444. 1444 mod289: 289*5=1445, so 1444≡-1 mod289.

So 134⁴≡-1 mod289, so 134⁴ +1≡0 mod289. So 134 is another solution.

So now I have two solutions:110 and134.

Wait, earlier when I multiplied110 by3, I got41,123,80, but none worked except110. So perhaps the four solutions are110,134, something else.

Wait, let me compute 134*3=402≡402-289=113 mod289.

Check 113⁴ +1 mod289.

Compute 113²=12769. 12769 mod289: 289*44=12716, 12769-12716=53.

113⁴=53²=2809. 2809 mod289: 289*9=2601, 2809-2601=208. 208+1=209≡209≠0 mod289.

Hmm, not a solution.

Wait, perhaps the four solutions are110,134,110+134=244, and another one.

Wait, 110+134=244. Let me check 244⁴ +1 mod289.

244 mod289=244.

244²=59536. 59536 mod289: 289*205=59405, 59536-59405=131.

244⁴=131²=17161. 17161 mod289: 289*59=17051, 17161-17051=110. 110+1=111≡111≠0.

So that's not a solution.

Wait, perhaps the four solutions are110,134, and two others. Alternatively, perhaps I should compute 110*3=330≡41 mod289 and 134*3=402≡113 mod289. Neither of these worked, as seen earlier.

Alternatively, perhaps the four solutions are110,134, 244, and another. But this approach isn't working.

Alternatively, perhaps I can accept that 110 is the smallest solution, even though I thought there were four solutions. But according to my earlier checks, only110 and134 are solutions. Maybe I made a mistake in the earlier assumption.

Wait, let me check 134⁴ +1 mod289 again.

134²=17956. 17956 mod289: 289*62=17978, which is larger, so 289*61=17629. 17956-17629=327. 327-289=38. So 134²≡38 mod289.

Then, 134⁴=38²=1444. 1444 mod289: 289*5=1445, so 1444≡-1 mod289. So 134⁴≡-1 mod289. So 134⁴ +1≡0 mod289. So yes, 134 is a solution.

Similarly, let me check 134*3=402≡113 mod289. 113⁴ +1:

113²=12769 mod289=53. 53²=2809 mod289=208. 208+1=209≡209≠0.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps I should note that 110 and134 are the only solutions below289/2, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the four solutions are110,134,179, and another. But I'm not sure.

In any case, from my checks, the smallest m is110. So the least positive integer m is110.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The least prime \( p \) for which there exists a positive integer \( n \) such that \( p^2 \) divides \( n^4 + 1 \) is \( 17 \). To find the smallest positive integer \( m \) such that \( m^4 + 1 \) is divisible by \( 17^2 = 289 \), we use Hensel's lemma to lift the solution \( n \equiv 8 \mod 17 \) to modulo \( 289 \). After solving, we find that \( m = 110 \) is the smallest such integer.

\boxed{110}
