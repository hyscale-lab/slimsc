Okay, so I've got this problem about coloring the vertices of a regular octagon either red or blue. Each vertex is colored independently with equal probability, so each color has a 50% chance. The question is asking for the probability that we can rotate the octagon such that all the blue vertices end up where the red ones were originally, and vice versa. They mention that the probability is m/n where m and n are coprime, and we need to find m + n.

Hmm, let's break this down. First, a regular octagon has eight sides, so eight vertices. Each vertex can be red or blue, each with a 50% chance. So the total number of possible colorings is 2^8, which is 256. That seems straightforward.

Now, the problem is about rotations. So we're considering rotations of the octagon, which would permute the positions of the vertices. If after some rotation, all the blue vertices end up where red ones were, and all red ones where blue were, that would mean that the coloring is symmetric under that rotation, but with colors swapped.

Wait, actually, the problem says "so that all of the blue vertices end up at positions where there were originally red vertices." So, after rotation, every blue vertex moves to a position that was previously red, and every red vertex moves to a position that was previously blue. So essentially, the coloring is being swapped by a rotation.

So for this to happen, the coloring must be such that when we rotate it by a certain number of positions, the colors are inverted. So, for example, if we rotate by k positions, each red vertex moves to a position that was blue, and each blue to a red.

But how does this work? Let me think. Each rotation corresponds to a cyclic shift. So, for example, rotating by 1 position moves each vertex to the next one, and so on. The key is that after such a rotation, the colors are flipped.

So, the coloring must be such that it's invariant under rotation by k positions, but with colors swapped. That is, the coloring is a "swap orbit" under rotation by k.

Wait, perhaps we can model this as a function f such that f(v_i) = color of vertex i. Then, after rotation by k, each vertex i goes to i + k mod 8. So the color of vertex i after rotation is f(i + k). For the colors to be swapped, we need f(i + k) = opposite of f(i). So, f(i + k) = not f(i) for all i.

But wait, in that case, applying the rotation twice would give f(i + 2k) = not f(i +k) = not (not f(i)) = f(i). So, after two rotations, we get back the original colors. So, if we rotate by k twice, we have the identity permutation, so the colors must satisfy f(i + 2k) = f(i). So, the period must divide 2k.

But since the octagon has 8 vertices, the possible rotation symmetries are rotations by 0, 1, 2, ..., 7 positions. But 0 is the identity, so it doesn't change anything. So, the possible nontrivial rotations are by 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 positions. But since rotation by k is the same as rotation by 8 -k in the opposite direction, we can consider k from 1 to 4, as beyond that, it's equivalent to a smaller k.

So, for each possible rotation k, we need to find colorings where f(i +k) = not f(i) for all i. Then, the total number of such colorings would be the union over all possible k's. However, we have to be careful about overlapping cases where a coloring might satisfy the condition for multiple k's.

Wait, but the problem is asking for the probability that there exists some rotation k such that after rotating by k, all blue vertices are now where red ones were. So, the event is that such a rotation exists. So we're looking for colorings where the coloring is a "swap" under some rotation.

So, perhaps we can model this as the union over all possible rotations k of the colorings that satisfy f(i +k) = not f(i) for all i. Then, by inclusion-exclusion, we can compute the probability.

But inclusion-exclusion over 7 rotations (k=1 to 7) might get complicated. Alternatively, maybe the only nontrivial k's that can satisfy f(i +k) = not f(i) for all i are those where 2k is a multiple of 8, so that applying the rotation twice brings you back to the original. Because if 2k is a multiple of 8, then f(i + 2k) = f(i), which is consistent with f(i +k) = not f(i).

So, 2k must be congruent to 0 mod 8, so k must be 0, 4. But k=0 is trivial (identity). So the only nontrivial k is 4, which is rotation by 4 positions. Wait, because 2*4=8, which is 0 mod 8. So, only k=4 would satisfy the condition that rotating twice brings you back.

Wait, but if you rotate by k=2, then 2k=4, which is not 0 mod 8. So, for k=2, f(i+2)=not f(i). Then, f(i+4)= not f(i+2) = not (not f(i))=f(i). So, the coloring would have period 4. But that might not necessarily be a swap when you rotate by 2, unless all the colorings are periodic with period 4.

Wait, perhaps I need to think about the possible k's and how they affect the coloring.

Let me consider each possible rotation k and see if such colorings exist.

First, k=1: Suppose we rotate by 1 position and the colors are swapped. Then, for each vertex i, f(i+1) = not f(i). But then, applying this recursively, f(i+2) = not f(i+1) = not (not f(i)) = f(i). Then f(i+3)=not f(i+2)=not f(i), f(i+4)=f(i), etc. So, this would imply that the coloring is periodic with period 2, alternating colors. However, for an octagon, which has 8 vertices, a period of 2 would mean that the entire octagon is colored in an alternating fashion, like red, blue, red, blue, etc. So, is this possible?

Yes, but wait, let's check. If we have a rotation by 1, then f(i+1) = not f(i). So, starting from i=0, f(0) is red, then f(1) is blue, f(2) is red, etc. So, the coloring would be R, B, R, B, R, B, R, B. Then, rotating by 1 would shift all colors, but since it's alternating, after rotation, it would swap colors. So, the blue would be where red was, and vice versa. So, this is a valid coloring.

But wait, in that case, such a coloring would also satisfy rotation by 1, 3, 5, 7, because those are all odd rotations. Because if you rotate by an odd number, it's equivalent to an odd number of shifts, which would flip the colors. But wait, no, because rotating by 1 is different from rotating by 3. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I need to think in terms of group theory. The rotation group of the octagon is cyclic of order 8. So, the possible rotations are generated by rotation by 1. Each rotation can be thought of as an element of the group C8.

Now, for a coloring to satisfy f(i + k) = not f(i) for all i, the coloring must be a "swap" under rotation by k. So, for each k, we can define a function f that is invariant under rotation by k, but with the colors swapped.

Now, to find the number of such colorings for each k, and then combine them.

But how many such colorings exist for each k?

First, consider k=0: rotation by 0 (identity). Then, f(i +0)=f(i)=not f(i) implies f(i)=not f(i), which is only possible if f(i) is undefined, which is impossible. So, no colorings satisfy this except the empty set, but since all vertices must be colored, k=0 is invalid.

Wait, but actually, perhaps k=0 isn't considered because you can't have a swap under the identity rotation. So, we can ignore k=0.

Now, for k=1: as I thought earlier, the coloring must satisfy f(i+1)=not f(i). So, the coloring must alternate between red and blue. So, the colorings that are alternating R, B, R, B,... etc., which are exactly two colorings: one starting with red, and one starting with blue.

Wait, but no, wait: Let me think. If you have a cyclic octagon, starting with red, then blue, red, etc., after 8 steps, you'd end up with red again. So, the last vertex would be red, which is the same as the first. So, the coloring is consistent.

But for an octagon, which has even number of vertices, starting with R and alternating gives R, B, R, B, R, B, R, B. Similarly, starting with B gives B, R, B, R, etc. So, those are two distinct colorings.

So, for k=1, there are two colorings that satisfy f(i+1)=not f(i). Similarly, for k=3, 5, 7, which are coprime to 8 (since 8 is 2^3, the numbers coprime are 1,3,5,7), the same would apply.

Wait, but for k=2, which is not coprime to 8, let's see. If we have k=2, then f(i+2)=not f(i). Then, applying this twice, f(i+4)=not f(i+2)=not (not f(i))=f(i). So, the coloring is periodic with period 4. So, f(i+4)=f(i), and f(i+2)=not f(i).

So, that would mean the coloring is R, B, R, B, R, B, R, B, but wait, that's the same as k=1. Hmm, no, in this case, for k=2, the coloring must have f(0)=R, f(2)=B, f(4)=R, f(6)=B; and f(1)=?, but from f(i+2)=not f(i), so f(1)=not f(-1)=not f(7). Wait, this might get complicated.

Wait, perhaps it's better to model each possible k and see how many colorings satisfy f(i +k)=not f(i) for all i.

So, for k=1: as above, the colorings must alternate, so two colorings.

For k=2: Let's try to find such colorings. So, f(i+2)=not f(i). So, let's index the vertices from 0 to 7.

So, for i=0: f(2)=not f(0)

i=1: f(3)=not f(1)

i=2: f(4)=not f(2)=not(not f(0))=f(0)

i=3: f(5)=not f(3)=not(not f(1))=f(1)

i=4: f(6)=not f(4)=not f(0)

i=5: f(7)=not f(5)=not f(1)

i=6: f(0)=not f(6)=not(not f(0))=f(0) --> which is consistent.

i=7: f(1)=not f(7)=not(not f(1))=f(1) --> consistent.

So, we see that f(0) determines f(2)=not f(0), f(4)=f(0), f(6)=not f(0).

Similarly, f(1) determines f(3)=not f(1), f(5)=f(1), f(7)=not f(1).

So, the coloring is determined by f(0) and f(1). Each can be red or blue. So, there are 2*2=4 possible colorings for k=2.

Wait, let me check. For example, if f(0)=R, then f(2)=B, f(4)=R, f(6)=B.

Similarly, f(1)=R, then f(3)=B, f(5)=R, f(7)=B.

So, the coloring would be R, R, B, B, R, R, B, B.

Similarly, other combinations would lead to different colorings. So, yes, 4 colorings for k=2.

Similarly, for k=3, since 3 and 8 are coprime, it's similar to k=1.

Wait, let me check for k=3.

For k=3, f(i+3)=not f(i) for all i.

So, let's see the implications.

For i=0: f(3)=not f(0)

i=1: f(4)=not f(1)

i=2: f(5)=not f(2)

i=3: f(6)=not f(3)=not(not f(0))=f(0)

i=4: f(7)=not f(4)=not(not f(1))=f(1)

i=5: f(0)=not f(5)=not(not f(2))=f(2)

i=6: f(1)=not f(6)=not f(0)

i=7: f(2)=not f(7)=not f(1)

Wait, this seems more complicated. Let me see if I can find a pattern.

If we follow the cycle starting at 0:

0 →3 →6 →1 →4 →7 →2 →5 →0

So, each step adds 3, modulo 8.

So, the cycle is: 0,3,6,1,4,7,2,5,0.

So, the coloring must alternate along this cycle.

Starting with f(0), then f(3)=not f(0), f(6)=not f(3)=f(0), f(1)=not f(6)=not f(0), f(4)=not f(1)=f(0), f(7)=not f(4)=not f(0), f(2)=not f(7)=f(0), f(5)=not f(2)=not f(0), f(0)=not f(5)=f(0). Hmm, this is consistent.

Wait, but this seems to require that f(0) = f(0), which is always true, but let me see:

Wait, starting from f(0), f(3) is not f(0), f(6) is not f(3)=f(0), f(1)=not f(6)=not f(0), etc. So, the entire cycle is determined by f(0). So, if f(0)=R, then the sequence is R, B, R, B, etc., along the cycle.

Similarly, if f(0)=B, then the sequence is B, R, B, R, etc.

But wait, the cycle has 8 elements, which is even. So, starting with R, the cycle would be R, B, R, B, R, B, R, B, which is consistent when you get back to f(0)=R. So, this is possible.

Similarly, starting with B would lead to B, R, B, R, etc.

So, for k=3, there are two possible colorings: one starting with R and one starting with B.

Similarly, for k=5 and k=7, since they are coprime with 8, I think the same applies. So, each would have two colorings. Wait, let me check for k=5.

For k=5: f(i+5)=not f(i). Let's see the cycle:

Starting from 0: 0,5,2,7,4,1,6,3,0.

So, similar to k=3, because 5 is -3 mod 8.

So, the cycle is 0→5→2→7→4→1→6→3→0.

So, again, the coloring must alternate along this cycle. So, starting with f(0)=R, then f(5)=B, f(2)=R, f(7)=B, etc. So, consistent.

Thus, for k=3,5,7, which are coprime to 8, each has two colorings.

Now, for k=4: Let's see. f(i+4)=not f(i).

So, for i=0: f(4)=not f(0)

i=1: f(5)=not f(1)

i=2: f(6)=not f(2)

i=3: f(7)=not f(3)

i=4: f(0)=not f(4)=not(not f(0))=f(0) → consistent

i=5: f(1)=not f(5)=not(not f(1))=f(1) → consistent

i=6: f(2)=not f(6)=not(not f(2))=f(2) → consistent

i=7: f(3)=not f(7)=not(not f(3))=f(3) → consistent

So, in this case, each f(i) is determined by f(i+4)=not f(i). So, the coloring is such that each vertex and its opposite (since 4 is half of 8) have opposite colors.

So, this would mean that for each pair of opposite vertices, one is red and the other is blue. Since there are four such pairs, each pair has two colorings (R,B or B,R). So, the total number of colorings is 2^4=16.

Wait, but wait: For each of the four pairs, we can choose the color of one vertex, and the other is determined. So, for each pair, two choices: R and B or B and R. So, four pairs, each with two choices: 2^4=16 colorings.

So, for k=4, there are 16 colorings.

Now, for k=6: Since 6 mod 8 is equivalent to -2, so it's similar to k=2.

So, let's see for k=6: f(i+6)=not f(i).

But wait, 6 is equivalent to -2 mod 8, so f(i+6)=f(i-2)=not f(i).

So, similar to k=2.

So, the implications would be similar to k=2.

So, for k=6, the cycle would be similar to k=2, leading to periodicity of 4.

Wait, let me think. For k=6, the cycle is 0,6,4,2,0; 1,7,5,3,1; etc.

So, each cycle has length 4, so the coloring is determined by the first four vertices, with each pair of opposite vertices (in the cycle) being opposite colors.

So, for each of the two cycles (0,6,4,2) and (1,7,5,3), we can choose the color of the starting vertex, and the rest are determined.

So, for each cycle, 2 choices, so total colorings: 2*2=4.

So, for k=6, there are 4 colorings.

Similarly, for k=2, we have 4 colorings.

Now, for k=7: Since 7 is coprime to 8, similar to k=1,3,5,7, which are all coprime.

Wait, but earlier I thought k=7 would be similar to k=1, but let me check.

Wait, for k=7, which is -1 mod 8, so f(i+7)=not f(i). So, similar to k=1, but in the opposite direction.

But the cycle would be 0→7→6→5→4→3→2→1→0.

So, along this cycle, the colors must alternate.

So, similar to k=1, each coloring is determined by the starting color, and alternates around the cycle.

So, two colorings for k=7.

Similarly, for k=3,5,7, which are coprime to 8, each has two colorings.

So, now, summarizing:

For each rotation k, the number of colorings that satisfy f(i +k) = not f(i) for all i is as follows:

k=1: 2 colorings

k=2:4 colorings

k=3:2 colorings

k=4:16 colorings

k=5:2 colorings

k=6:4 colorings

k=7:2 colorings

Wait, but I think I need to check for overlaps. Because some colorings might satisfy the condition for multiple k's. For example, the fully alternating coloring (k=1) also satisfies k=3,5,7, because it's invariant under rotation by any odd number. Wait, no, because for the fully alternating coloring, rotating by 1 gives the same as swapping colors, but rotating by 3 would also require that f(i+3)=not f(i). But in the fully alternating coloring, f(i+3)=not f(i) only if 3 is even, which it isn't. Wait, no, in the fully alternating coloring, the colors alternate every step, so f(i+1)=not f(i), and so f(i+3)=not f(i+2)=not(not f(i))=f(i). So, for the fully alternating coloring, f(i+3)=f(i), which would mean that if we rotate by 3, the colors don't swap; instead, they stay the same. So, that coloring wouldn't satisfy the condition for k=3.

Wait, that suggests that colorings for different k's are distinct. So, perhaps the colorings for different k's don't overlap. But I'm not entirely sure.

Wait, let's take a specific example. Suppose I have a fully alternating coloring: R,B,R,B,R,B,R,B. Let's see if this satisfies any other k besides k=1,7.

For k=3: f(i+3) should be not f(i). Let's check for i=0: f(3)=B, not f(0)=not R=B. So, yes, f(3)=B=not R. For i=1: f(4)=R, not f(1)=not B=R. So, yes. Similarly, for i=2: f(5)=B=not R.

Wait, but wait, in the fully alternating coloring, f(i+3)=not f(i). Because every step flips the color. So, the fully alternating coloring actually satisfies f(i +k)=not f(i) for any odd k, because adding an odd number of steps would flip the color. So, for k=1,3,5,7, the fully alternating coloring satisfies f(i+k)=not f(i).

But that's a problem because it would mean that this coloring is being counted multiple times across different k's.

Wait, but in reality, each coloring can only be counted once, but in our earlier count, we assumed that each k's colorings are unique. But clearly, the fully alternating coloring is counted in k=1,3,5,7, as it satisfies all of them.

Similarly, the other fully alternating coloring (starting with B) is also counted in all these k's.

So, that suggests that our initial counts for each k are overcounting, because the fully alternating colorings are being counted multiple times.

Similarly, for the k=4 colorings, where each pair of opposite vertices are different, those colorings don't satisfy any other k's, because if you rotate by 1, the colors wouldn't swap. For example, if you have R,B,R,B,R,B,R,B, rotating by 1 would give B,R,B,R,B,R,B,R, which is the swapped version. But in the case of the fully alternating colorings, they satisfy multiple k's.

So, to accurately count the total number of colorings that satisfy any of the k's, we need to use inclusion-exclusion, considering overlaps between different k's.

So, let's denote the sets A_k as the set of colorings satisfying f(i +k)=not f(i) for all i. We need to find |A_1 ∪ A_2 ∪ A_3 ∪ A_4 ∪ A_5 ∪ A_6 ∪ A_7|.

By the inclusion-exclusion principle:

|A1 ∪ A2 ∪ ... ∪ A7| = Σ|Ak| - Σ|Ak ∩ Al| + Σ|Ak ∩ Al ∩ Am| - ... + (-1)^{n+1}|A1 ∩ A2 ∩ ... ∩ A7}|.

But since this can get very complicated, perhaps we can find a smarter way.

Wait, another approach: the problem is equivalent to finding the number of colorings for which there exists a rotation k such that applying rotation k swaps the colors. So, each such k corresponds to a permutation of the vertices, and the coloring is swapped under that permutation.

In group theory terms, each rotation is an element of the group C8, and the colorings we're interested in are those that are swapped by some non-identity element of the group.

But perhaps another way to think about it is to consider that for a coloring to be swappable by some rotation, it must be compatible with the rotation's cycle structure.

For example, for a rotation by k, the permutation decomposes into cycles. For each cycle, the colors must alternate between red and blue. So, in each cycle, the coloring must alternate, which implies that the length of each cycle must be even, because you can't alternate colors in an odd-length cycle without ending up with a contradiction.

Wait, that's an important point. So, for a rotation by k, the permutation of the vertices can be decomposed into cycles. For the coloring to be swapped under this rotation, each cycle must have even length, so that the colors alternate correctly.

So, for a given k, the number of colorings that satisfy f(i +k)=not f(i) is zero unless all cycles in the permutation induced by k have even length.

Wait, but in our earlier analysis, for k=1, the permutation is a single 8-cycle, which has even length (8), so it's possible. For k=2, the permutation breaks into two 4-cycles, each of even length. For k=3, it's a single 8-cycle again, so possible. For k=4, it breaks into four 2-cycles, which are even. For k=5, same as k=3, single 8-cycle. For k=6, same as k=2, two 4-cycles. For k=7, same as k=1, single 8-cycle.

So, all these k's have cycle decompositions with even-length cycles, which allows for the colorings to satisfy f(i+k)=not f(i).

Now, the number of colorings for each k is 2^{number of cycles}, because each cycle can be independently assigned a starting color (R or B), and the rest are determined.

Wait, for k=1: single 8-cycle. So, number of colorings is 2^1=2, which matches our earlier count.

For k=2: two 4-cycles. So, number of colorings is 2^2=4, which matches.

For k=3: single 8-cycle, so 2 colorings.

For k=4: four 2-cycles, so 2^4=16 colorings.

For k=5: single 8-cycle, 2 colorings.

For k=6: two 4-cycles, 4 colorings.

For k=7: single 8-cycle, 2 colorings.

So, that seems consistent.

Now, the problem is that some colorings are counted in multiple A_k's. For example, the fully alternating colorings are counted in A_1, A_3, A_5, A_7, because they are invariant under rotation by any odd k.

Similarly, the colorings for k=2 and k=6 have their own colorings that don't overlap with each other or with the others.

Wait, but let's think about which colorings are common between different A_k's.

For example, the fully alternating colorings (A_1, A_3, A_5, A_7) are the same for all these k's. So, these two colorings (starting with R and starting with B) are counted four times each, once for each k=1,3,5,7.

Similarly, the colorings for k=2 and k=6: are they overlapping? Let's see.

For k=2, the colorings are R,B,R,B,R,B,R,B, but wait no, for k=2, the colorings are periodic with period 4, not period 2. Wait, earlier for k=2, the colorings were R,R,B,B,R,R,B,B and similar.

Wait, no, for k=2, the colorings are determined by two independent cycles, each of length 4. So, for example, one such coloring is R,R,B,B,R,R,B,B, where vertices 0,2,4,6 are R and 1,3,5,7 are B. Another is R,B,R,B,R,B,R,B, but no, that's for k=1.

Wait, no, for k=2, the colorings are such that each 4-cycle (0,2,4,6) and (1,3,5,7) are each colored in an alternating fashion. So, for example, in the first 4-cycle, f(0)=R, f(2)=B, f(4)=R, f(6)=B. Similarly, in the second 4-cycle, f(1)=R, f(3)=B, f(5)=R, f(7)=B. So, the entire coloring would be R,R,B,B,R,R,B,B.

Wait, but then for this coloring, if we rotate by 2, we get R→B, B→R, etc. So, f(i+2)=not f(i). So, this coloring is in A_2.

But does this coloring belong to any other A_k's?

For example, does it belong to A_6? Because k=6 is equivalent to rotating by -2.

So, for this coloring, would f(i+6)=not f(i)?

Let's see: i=0: f(6)=B, not f(0)=not R=B → yes.

i=1: f(7)=B, not f(1)=not R=B → yes.

i=2: f(0)=R, not f(2)=not B=R → yes.

i=3: f(1)=R, not f(3)=not B=R → yes.

i=4: f(2)=B, not f(4)=not R=B → yes.

i=5: f(3)=B, not f(5)=not R=B → yes.

i=6: f(4)=R, not f(6)=not B=R → yes.

i=7: f(5)=R, not f(7)=not B=R → yes.

So, yes, this coloring is also in A_6.

Similarly, any coloring in A_2 is also in A_6, because rotating by 2 and rotating by 6 are inverses, and the condition is symmetric.

So, the colorings in A_2 and A_6 are the same set. So, |A_2 ∩ A_6|=4, and the colorings are exactly the same.

Similarly, the colorings in A_4 are those where each pair of opposite vertices are different. So, for example, R,B,R,B,R,B,R,B is one such coloring, but wait, no, that's the fully alternating one, which is in A_1, etc.

Wait, no, the colorings in A_4 have each pair of opposite vertices being different. For example, R,B,R,B,R,B,R,B is such a coloring, but it's also in A_1,3,5,7.

Wait, no, earlier I thought that the colorings in A_4 are those where each pair of opposite vertices are different, which is 16 colorings. But the fully alternating colorings are a subset of those 16. Because in the fully alternating colorings, each opposite pair is different, but also, the coloring alternates every step.

So, the fully alternating colorings are a subset of A_4. So, the two colorings in A_1 are also in A_4.

Similarly, the colorings in A_2 and A_6 are the same, and they are a subset of A_4? Let's check.

Take the coloring R,R,B,B,R,R,B,B. In this coloring, each pair of opposite vertices are the same: 0 and 4 are R, 1 and 5 are R, 2 and 6 are B, 3 and 7 are B. So, this coloring is not in A_4, because in A_4, each opposite pair must be different.

Wait, so actually, the colorings in A_2 and A_6 are not in A_4, because in A_4, each opposite pair must be different, but in A_2, the opposite pairs are same-colored.

Wait, that makes sense because A_4's condition is stronger: it requires that each pair of opposite vertices are different, which is a stricter condition than A_2's condition, which only requires that every 4th vertex is different.

Wait, no, in A_2, each vertex and the one two steps away are different. So, for example, 0 and 2 are different, 2 and 4 are different, etc. But 0 and 4 are the same in A_2's colorings. So, in A_2, the opposite vertices (separated by 4 steps) are the same color, which violates A_4's condition.

So, the colorings in A_2 and A_6 are distinct from those in A_4.

So, to recap:

- A_1, A_3, A_5, A_7: each has 2 colorings, but these colorings are shared among all four sets. So, the two fully alternating colorings are in all four A_k's.

- A_2 and A_6: each has 4 colorings, and these are the same set, so |A_2 ∩ A_6|=4.

- A_4: 16 colorings, which include the two fully alternating colorings (since in A_4, opposite vertices are different, which is true for the fully alternating colorings).

So, when we apply inclusion-exclusion, we have to account for overlaps.

So, let's define:

- S1 = sum of |A_k| for k=1 to 7.

- S2 = sum of |A_k ∩ A_l| for all k < l.

- S3 = sum of |A_k ∩ A_l ∩ A_m| for all k < l < m.

- etc.

But this is going to get complicated, but perhaps manageable.

First, S1 = |A1| + |A2| + |A3| + |A4| + |A5| + |A6| + |A7|

From earlier, |A1|=|A3|=|A5|=|A7|=2 each, so 4*2=8.

|A2|=|A6|=4 each, so 2*4=8.

|A4|=16.

So, S1=8+8+16=32.

Now, S2: sum over all pairs (k < l) of |A_k ∩ A_l|.

We need to find |A_k ∩ A_l| for each pair.

Let's consider different cases based on k and l.

Case 1: Both k and l are odd (1,3,5,7).

In this case, A_k and A_l both require that the coloring is fully alternating. Because any odd rotation would require that, as we saw earlier.

So, for any two odd k and l, A_k ∩ A_l is the set of fully alternating colorings, which are two in number.

So, for any pair of odd k and l, |A_k ∩ A_l|=2.

How many such pairs are there? There are C(4,2)=6 pairs among the four odd k's.

Case 2: One k is odd, and l is even (2,4,6).

So, for example, k=1 and l=2.

What's |A1 ∩ A2|?

A1 requires fully alternating coloring, A2 requires colorings where f(i+2)=not f(i).

But in the fully alternating coloring, f(i+2)=not f(i) only if the coloring alternates every two steps. Wait, no, in the fully alternating coloring, f(i+1)=not f(i), so f(i+2)=f(i). So, in the fully alternating coloring, f(i+2)=f(i), which is the opposite of what A2 requires (f(i+2)=not f(i)).

So, the only way both can be satisfied is if f(i+2)=f(i) and f(i+2)=not f(i), which implies f(i)=not f(i), which is impossible unless f(i) is undefined. So, there are no colorings that satisfy both A1 and A2.

So, |A1 ∩ A2|=0.

Similarly, for any pair where one is odd and the other is even (except when the even is 4?), let's check.

Wait, for A4, which requires that each opposite pair is different.

In the fully alternating coloring, each opposite pair is different. So, the two colorings in A1 are also in A4.

So, |A1 ∩ A4|=2.

Similarly, |A3 ∩ A4|=2, |A5 ∩ A4|=2, |A7 ∩ A4|=2.

Now, for even k and l:

Case 3: Both k and l are even (2,4,6).

So, for example, k=2 and l=4.

What's |A2 ∩ A4|?

A2 requires that f(i+2)=not f(i), and A4 requires that f(i+4)=not f(i).

But from A2, f(i+4)=f(i), because f(i+2)=not f(i), so f(i+4)=f(i+2+2)=not f(i+2)=not(not f(i))=f(i).

But A4 requires f(i+4)=not f(i).

So, combining these, f(i)=f(i+4)=not f(i), which implies f(i)=not f(i), which is impossible. So, |A2 ∩ A4|=0.

Similarly, |A2 ∩ A6|=4, because A2 and A6 are the same set.

Wait, no, A2 and A6 are the same set, so |A2 ∩ A6|=4.

Similarly, |A6 ∩ A4|=0, because as above, A6's condition is similar to A2's, which conflicts with A4.

So, let's break down the even-even pairs:

- (2,6): |A2 ∩ A6|=4.

- (2,4): 0.

- (6,4): 0.

- (2,2): same set, but since we're considering k < l, we don't include duplicates.

Wait, actually, in the sum S2, we're considering all unordered pairs with k < l, so the even-even pairs are (2,4), (2,6), (4,6).

We've established:

- (2,4): 0.

- (2,6):4.

- (4,6):0.

So, for even-even pairs, sum is 0 +4 +0=4.

Now, let's tabulate all possible pairs:

Total pairs: C(7,2)=21.

We've considered:

- 6 pairs among the four odd k's: each contributes 2.

- 3 pairs among the three even k's: contributing 4.

- The other 12 pairs are between odd and even k's, each contributing 0, except for the pairs where the even k is 4 and the odd k's: for each odd k, |A_k ∩ A4|=2. So, how many such pairs are there?

There are four odd k's (1,3,5,7), each paired with 4. So, four pairs: (1,4), (3,4), (5,4), (7,4). Each contributes 2.

So, these four pairs contribute 4*2=8.

The remaining pairs are between odd k's and even k's other than 4. There are 4 odd k's and 2 even k's (2,6). So, 4*2=8 pairs. Each contributes 0.

So, summing up:

S2 = sum of |A_k ∩ A_l| for all k < l.

Which is:

- 6 pairs (odd-odd): 6*2=12.

- 4 pairs (odd-even where even=4): 4*2=8.

- 1 pair (even-even where even=2 and 6): 4.

- The rest are 0.

Wait, but wait, the even-even pairs are only (2,4), (2,6), (4,6). Among these, only (2,6) contributes 4, the others contribute 0.

So, S2=12 (from odd-odd) +8 (from odd-even where even=4) +4 (from even-even (2,6))=24.

Wait, but let me recount:

- Odd-odd pairs: C(4,2)=6 pairs, each contributes 2: 6*2=12.

- Odd-even pairs where even=4: 4 pairs (each odd with 4), each contributes 2: 4*2=8.

- Even-even pairs: (2,4), (2,6), (4,6). Only (2,6) contributes 4, others 0: total 4.

So, S2=12+8+4=24.

Now, S3 is the sum over all triplets (k < l < m) of |A_k ∩ A_l ∩ A_m|.

This is getting more complicated, but let's try.

First, any triplet including two or more odd k's:

For example, triplet (1,3,5): since all are odd, their intersection is the fully alternating colorings, which are 2. So, |A1 ∩ A3 ∩ A5|=2.

Similarly, any triplet of three odd k's contributes 2.

How many such triplets are there? C(4,3)=4 triplets.

Now, triplet with two odd and one even:

For example, (1,3,2): |A1 ∩ A3 ∩ A2|=0, because as before, A1 and A2 have no common colorings.

Similarly, any triplet with two odd and one even (other than 4) would contribute 0.

What about triplet with one odd and two even:

For example, (1,2,4): |A1 ∩ A2 ∩ A4|=0, because A1 and A2 have no common colorings.

Similarly, any triplet with even-even and one odd would contribute 0.

What about triplet (2,4,6): |A2 ∩ A4 ∩ A6|=0, because A2 and A4 have no common colorings.

Similarly, any triplet with all three even would contribute 0, except perhaps if all are 4, but we're considering distinct k's.

Wait, but in our case, the even k's are 2,4,6. So, a triplet could be (2,4,6). But |A2 ∩ A4 ∩ A6|=0, because A2 and A4 have no common colorings.

So, the only triplets that contribute are those with all three k's odd, each contributing 2.

So, S3=4 triplets * 2=8.

Similarly, S4 is the sum over all 4-wise intersections. Let's see:

The only 4-wise intersection that contributes is (1,3,5,7), which has |A1 ∩ A3 ∩ A5 ∩ A7|=2.

Similarly, any 4-wise intersection with all four k's odd contributes 2.

There's only one such 4-wise intersection: (1,3,5,7).

So, S4=1 *2=2.

Similarly, higher-order intersections (5-wise, etc.) would be the same as the 4-wise, since adding more sets doesn't change the intersection beyond the four odd k's.

So, S5=0, because any 5-wise intersection would include the four odd k's and another even k, but the intersection of four odd k's is already 2, and adding an even k would bring it down to 0.

Wait, no, actually, the intersection of four odd k's is already the two fully alternating colorings. Adding another set (even k) would require that these colorings also satisfy the even k's condition, which they don't, except when the even k is 4.

Wait, for example, the intersection (1,3,5,7,4) would require colorings that are in all A_k's for k=1,3,5,7,4. But the only colorings in all A_k's for k=1,3,5,7 are the two fully alternating colorings, which are also in A4. So, |A1 ∩ A3 ∩ A5 ∩ A7 ∩ A4|=2.

But wait, in higher-order intersections, we have to consider all possible combinations. But this is getting too complicated, and perhaps beyond the scope of what's needed.

Alternatively, perhaps the inclusion-exclusion stops at S4 because beyond that, the intersections are empty or already accounted for.

But for the sake of completeness, let's proceed.

S5 would be the sum over all 5-wise intersections.

The only 5-wise intersections that could contribute are those that include all four odd k's and one even k. Let's check if the two fully alternating colorings also satisfy the even k's condition.

As we saw earlier, the fully alternating colorings satisfy A4's condition, but not A2 or A6's.

So, for example, the intersection (1,3,5,7,4) would have |A1 ∩ A3 ∩ A5 ∩ A7 ∩ A4|=2.

Similarly, any 5-wise intersection that includes the four odd k's and k=4 would contribute 2.

How many such 5-wise intersections are there? Only one: (1,3,5,7,4).

Similarly, any other 5-wise intersection would include some even k's other than 4, which would result in |...|=0.

So, S5=1*2=2.

Similarly, S6 would be the sum over all 6-wise intersections.

The only 6-wise intersection that could contribute is (1,3,5,7,4, something). But adding another even k (2 or 6) would require that the colorings also satisfy A2 or A6, which they don't. So, |A1 ∩ A3 ∩ A5 ∩ A7 ∩ A4 ∩ A2|=0.

Similarly, any 6-wise intersection would have |...|=0.

So, S6=0.

Similarly, S7=0, because any 7-wise intersection would require colorings to satisfy at least one even k and one odd k, leading to |...|=0.

Finally, S8=|A1 ∩ A2 ∩ A3 ∩ A4 ∩ A5 ∩ A6 ∩ A7|=0, since it requires colorings to satisfy all conditions, which is impossible.

So, putting it all together:

Inclusion-exclusion formula:

|A1 ∪ A2 ∪ ... ∪ A7| = S1 - S2 + S3 - S4 + S5 - S6 + S7 - S8

Plugging in the numbers:

= 32 (S1) -24 (S2) +8 (S3) -2 (S4) +2 (S5) -0 +0 -0

Calculating step by step:

32 -24 =8

8 +8=16

16 -2=14

14 +2=16

So, total |A1 ∪ ... ∪ A7|=16.

Wait, that can't be right because the total number of colorings is 256, and we're getting only 16 colorings that satisfy the condition, but I thought there were more.

Wait, let's check the calculations again.

S1=32.

S2=24.

S3=8.

S4=2.

S5=2.

So,

|A1 ∪ ... ∪ A7|=32 -24 +8 -2 +2=16.

Hmm, that seems correct according to the inclusion-exclusion steps.

But wait, earlier we thought that A4 has 16 colorings, which include the two fully alternating colorings. But according to inclusion-exclusion, the total number is 16. So, that suggests that all colorings that satisfy any A_k are exactly the 16 colorings in A4.

But that can't be right because A2 and A6 have 4 colorings each, which are not in A4.

Wait, no, because in inclusion-exclusion, we're considering the union, which includes all colorings that are in any A_k. So, if |A1 ∪ ... ∪ A7|=16, that suggests that there are 16 colorings that satisfy any of the A_k conditions.

But earlier, we thought that A4 has 16 colorings, which include the two fully alternating colorings. So, perhaps the other colorings (from A2 and A6) are not being counted because they are also part of A4? But no, earlier we saw that the colorings in A2 and A6 are not in A4.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating S3 and beyond.

Wait, let's re-examine S3.

In S3, we considered only the triplets of odd k's, each contributing 2. But actually, there are other triplets that might contribute.

For example, triplet (2,4,6): |A2 ∩ A4 ∩ A6|=0, because A2 and A4 have no common colorings.

Similarly, triplet (1,2,4): |A1 ∩ A2 ∩ A4|=0.

But are there any triplets that include both even and odd k's that contribute?

Wait, let's think about triplet (1,3,4): |A1 ∩ A3 ∩ A4|=2, because the fully alternating colorings are in all three.

Similarly, triplet (1,5,4), etc., would also contribute 2.

So, how many such triplets are there?

There are C(4,2)=6 ways to choose two odd k's and one even k=4.

Each of these triplets contributes 2.

So, S3 should include these as well.

So, in addition to the 4 triplets of three odd k's, each contributing 2, we have 6 triplets of two odd k's and one even=4, each contributing 2.

So, S3=4*2 +6*2=8+12=20.

Similarly, S4 is the sum of all 4-wise intersections.

The 4-wise intersections include:

- The four odd k's: (1,3,5,7), contributing 2.

- The triplet of three odd k's plus 4: (1,3,5,4), etc. Each contributes 2.

How many such 4-wise intersections are there?

First, the one with all four odd k's:1.

Then, the ones with three odd k's and 4: C(4,3)=4.

Each contributes 2.

So, S4=1*2 +4*2=2+8=10.

Wait, but earlier I thought S4 was just 2, but that was incomplete.

Similarly, S5 would include:

- The four odd k's plus 4: contributing 2.

- The four odd k's plus 2: which is impossible, because the intersection would be 0.

- The four odd k's plus 6: same as above.

- The triplet of three odd k's plus 4 plus another even: which would require the fully alternating colorings to also satisfy A2 or A6, which they don't.

So, only the intersection (1,3,5,7,4) contributes 2.

So, S5=1*2=2.

Similarly, S6 would include:

- The four odd k's plus 4 plus another even: but the intersection would require colorings to satisfy both even and odd conditions, which only the fully alternating colorings do, but they don't satisfy the even conditions except for A4.

Wait, but the intersection (1,3,5,7,4,2) would require colorings to be in all A_k's, which is impossible, so |...|=0.

Similarly, S6=0.

So, updating the inclusion-exclusion:

S1=32

S2=24

S3=20

S4=10

S5=2

S6=0

S7=0

S8=0

So,

|A1 ∪ ... ∪ A7|= S1 - S2 + S3 - S4 + S5 - S6 + S7 - S8

=32 -24 +20 -10 +2 -0 +0 -0

Calculating step by step:

32-24=8

8+20=28

28-10=18

18+2=20

So, |A1 ∪ ... ∪ A7|=20.

Hmm, that seems better.

So, the total number of colorings that satisfy the condition is 20.

Wait, but earlier we thought that A4 has 16 colorings, which are the ones where each pair of opposite vertices are different. But according to inclusion-exclusion, the total is 20, which includes the 16 from A4 plus the 4 from A2 and A6.

Wait, but wait, the 16 from A4 include the two fully alternating colorings, which are also in A1,3,5,7.

So, perhaps the 20 colorings are:

- 16 from A4.

- 4 from A2 and A6.

But wait, that would be 20, but the two fully alternating colorings are already included in A4, so they are not adding any new colorings beyond the 16.

Wait, but according to inclusion-exclusion, the total is 20. So, perhaps the colorings in A2 and A6 are 4, and the colorings in A4 are 16, but they overlap in the two fully alternating colorings.

So, total colorings would be 16 +4 -2=18.

But according to inclusion-exclusion, it's 20. So, perhaps my approach is flawed.

Alternatively, perhaps the inclusion-exclusion is correct, and the total is 20.

But let's think differently.

Each coloring that satisfies the condition must be such that there exists a rotation k where applying it swaps the colors.

The possible k's are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7.

As we've found, the colorings are:

- For k=1,3,5,7: 2 colorings each, but overlapping for all four.

- For k=2,6:4 colorings each, but they're the same set.

- For k=4:16 colorings.

But the fully alternating colorings are in both A4 and the A_1,3,5,7.

So, the total number of colorings is:

Number of colorings in A4:16.

Number of colorings in A2 and A6:4, but subtract the overlap with A4.

Wait, but in A2 and A6, the colorings are not in A4, as we saw earlier.

Because in A2 and A6, opposite vertices are the same color, which violates A4's condition.

So, the 4 colorings in A2 and A6 are distinct from those in A4.

So, total colorings would be 16 +4=20.

But wait, according to inclusion-exclusion, it's 20.

So, the total number is 20.

So, the probability is 20/256=5/64.

But wait, 20 divided by 256 is 5/64.

But earlier, I thought that A4 has 16 colorings, and A2 and A6 add 4 more, totaling 20.

So, the probability is 20/256=5/64.

But wait, let me check if this is correct.

Wait, but let me think: the colorings in A4 are those where each pair of opposite vertices are different. There are four such pairs, each with two choices, so 2^4=16.

The colorings in A2 and A6 are those where each 4-cycle is colored alternately. Each 4-cycle has two choices, so 2^2=4.

These two sets are distinct because in A4, opposite vertices are different, while in A2 and A6, opposite vertices are the same.

So, indeed, total colorings are 16 +4=20.

Thus, the probability is 20/256=5/64.

Simplifying 5/64: 5 and 64 are coprime, so m=5, n=64, m+n=69.

Wait, but earlier, when I did inclusion-exclusion, I got 20 colorings, which gives 20/256=5/64.

But wait, in the problem statement, the probability is given as m/n, and the answer is m +n.

So, the answer would be 5 +64=69.

But wait, let me double-check because I might have missed something.

Wait, the colorings in A4 include the two fully alternating colorings, which are also in A1,3,5,7. But in the inclusion-exclusion, we accounted for overlaps, ending up with 20 colorings.

So, the answer should be 5/64, leading to 5+64=69.

But wait, another way to think about it: the number of colorings where there exists a rotation that swaps the colors is equal to the number of colorings that are symmetric under some rotation with swapped colors.

Which, as we saw, are the colorings in A4 (16) and the colorings in A2 and A6 (4), totaling 20.

Thus, the probability is 20/256=5/64.

So, the final answer is 5+64=69.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The probability that the octagon can be rotated so that all blue vertices end up where there were originally red vertices is 5/64. Therefore, m + n is 5 + 64 = 69.

$\boxed{69}$
