Okay, so I'm trying to solve this problem where I need to find the greatest four-digit number N. The condition is that if any one of its digits is changed to 1, the resulting number is divisible by 7. Then, I have to find Q + R where Q is the quotient and R is the remainder when N is divided by 1000.

Hmm, let's break this down. First, N is a four-digit number, so it ranges from 1000 to 9999. We need the greatest such number, so I might want to start checking from 9999 downwards until I find a number that satisfies the given condition.

But before jumping into that, let me understand the condition better. Whenever one of its digits is changed to 1, the number becomes divisible by 7. That means, for each digit in N, if I replace it with 1, the new number must be divisible by 7.

So, N has four digits: let's denote them as D1 D2 D3 D4. So N is 1000*D1 + 100*D2 + 10*D3 + D4.

When we change any one digit to 1, the resulting number must be divisible by 7. So, if I change D1 to 1, the number becomes 1000*1 + 100*D2 + 10*D3 + D4, which should be divisible by 7.

Similarly, if I change D2 to 1, the number becomes 1000*D1 + 100*1 + 10*D3 + D4, which must also be divisible by 7.

Same logic applies when changing D3 and D4 to 1.

So, for each digit position, changing it to 1 must result in a number divisible by 7.

This gives me four separate conditions, each corresponding to one digit position.

So, perhaps I can model each condition mathematically.

Let me denote N as N = 1000a + 100b + 10c + d, where a, b, c, d are digits from 0 to 9, with a ≠ 0 (since it's a four-digit number).

Now, when we replace a with 1, the number becomes N1 = 1000*1 + 100b + 10c + d = 1000 + 100b + 10c + d.

Similarly, replacing b with 1: N2 = 1000a + 100*1 + 10c + d.

Replacing c with 1: N3 = 1000a + 100b + 10*1 + d.

Replacing d with 1: N4 = 1000a + 100b + 10c + 1.

Each of these N1, N2, N3, N4 must be divisible by 7.

So N1 ≡ 0 mod 7,

N2 ≡ 0 mod 7,

N3 ≡ 0 mod 7,

N4 ≡ 0 mod 7.

So, let's write these congruences.

First, N1 = 1000 + 100b + 10c + d ≡ 0 mod 7.

Similarly, N2 = 1000a + 100 + 10c + d ≡ 0 mod 7.

N3 = 1000a + 100b + 10 + d ≡ 0 mod 7.

N4 = 1000a + 100b + 10c + 1 ≡ 0 mod 7.

I can compute the coefficients of a, b, c, d for each of these congruences.

First, let's compute 1000 mod 7, 100 mod 7, 10 mod 7, and 1 mod 7.

1000 / 7 is 142 *7 = 994, 1000 - 994=6. So 1000 ≡6 mod7.

100 /7: 7*14=98, 100-98=2, so 100≡2 mod7.

10 mod7 is 3.

1 mod7 is 1.

So, substituting into the congruences:

For N1: 6 + 2b + 3c + d ≡0 mod7.

For N2: 6a + 2 + 3c + d ≡0 mod7.

For N3: 6a + 2b +3 +d ≡0 mod7.

For N4:6a + 2b +3c +1 ≡0 mod7.

So, we have four equations:

1) 6 + 2b + 3c + d ≡0 mod7.

2) 6a + 2 + 3c + d ≡0 mod7.

3) 6a + 2b +3 +d ≡0 mod7.

4)6a + 2b +3c +1 ≡0 mod7.

Hmm, that's a system of four congruences with variables a, b, c, d.

Our goal is to find a four-digit number N=abcd, so a is from 1-9, b,c,d from 0-9.

We need to find the largest possible N, so we want a as large as possible, then b, etc.

So perhaps I can approach this by trying the largest possible a, then b, etc., and check these congruences.

Alternatively, maybe I can manipulate the equations to find relations between a, b, c, d.

Let me see. Let's write down the equations:

Equation 1: 2b + 3c + d ≡ -6 mod7.

Equation 2:6a +3c + d ≡ -2 mod7.

Equation 3:6a +2b +d ≡ -3 mod7.

Equation 4:6a +2b +3c ≡ -1 mod7.

Hmm, perhaps we can find some relations between these equations.

Let me subtract equation 1 from equation 2.

Equation2 - Equation1:

[6a +3c +d] - [2b +3c +d] ≡ (-2) - (-6) mod7.

Which simplifies to:6a -2b ≡4 mod7.

Simplify: 6a -2b =4 mod7.

I can factor 2: 2*(3a - b) ≡4 mod7.

Divide both sides by 2 (since 2 and 7 are coprime, 2 has an inverse mod7, which is 4 because 2*4=8≡1 mod7.

So, multiplying both sides by 4: (3a - b) ≡4*4=16≡2 mod7.

So, 3a -b ≡2 mod7. Let's call this Equation5: 3a -b ≡2 mod7.

Similarly, let's subtract equation 3 from equation2.

Equation2 - Equation3:

[6a +3c +d] - [6a +2b +d] ≡ (-2) - (-3) mod7.

Simplifies to:3c -2b ≡1 mod7. Let's call this Equation6: 3c -2b ≡1 mod7.

Similarly, subtract equation3 from equation4.

Equation4 - Equation3:

[6a +2b +3c] - [6a +2b +d] ≡ (-1) - (-3) mod7.

Simplifies to:3c -d ≡2 mod7. Equation7:3c -d ≡2 mod7.

Similarly, subtract equation1 from equation4.

Equation4 - Equation1:

[6a +2b +3c] - [2b +3c +d] ≡ (-1) - (-6) mod7.

Simplifies to:6a -d ≡5 mod7. Equation8:6a -d ≡5 mod7.

We can also consider other subtractions, but perhaps these four equations (Equation5, 6,7,8) can help us solve for variables.

Let me list the equations I have:

Equation5:3a -b ≡2 mod7.

Equation6:3c -2b ≡1 mod7.

Equation7:3c -d ≡2 mod7.

Equation8:6a -d ≡5 mod7.

Hmm, perhaps I can express some variables in terms of others.

From Equation5: b ≡3a -2 mod7.

From Equation8: d ≡6a -5 mod7.

From Equation7: d ≡3c -2 mod7.

So, from Equations7 and 8:

6a -5 ≡3c -2 mod7.

So, 6a -5 +2 ≡3c mod7.

6a -3 ≡3c mod7.

Divide both sides by 3 (since 3 and 7 are coprime, inverse is 5 because 3*5=15≡1 mod7).

So, (6a -3)/3 ≡c mod7.

Which is 2a -1 ≡c mod7.

So, c ≡2a -1 mod7.

Similarly, from Equation5: b ≡3a -2 mod7.

From Equation6:3c -2b ≡1 mod7.

We can substitute c and b from above into Equation6.

So, substitute c=2a -1 mod7 and b=3a -2 mod7.

So,

3*(2a -1) -2*(3a -2) ≡1 mod7.

Compute:

6a -3 -6a +4 ≡1 mod7.

Simplify:

(6a -6a) + (-3 +4) ≡1 mod7.

Which is 0a +1 ≡1 mod7.

Which is 1≡1 mod7. So, this is always true.

That's good; it doesn't give any new information.

So, now, variables b, c, d can be expressed in terms of a.

So, let's write:

b ≡3a -2 mod7.

c ≡2a -1 mod7.

d ≡6a -5 mod7.

Since b, c, d are digits (0-9), their values modulo7 are as above, but their actual values can be in that range.

So, perhaps I can write b = (3a -2) +7k1,

c= (2a -1) +7k2,

d= (6a -5) +7k3,

where k1, k2, k3 are integers such that b, c, d are between 0 and9.

Now, our aim is to find a, b, c, d such that all are digits, and N is as large as possible.

Since N is four-digit, a must be from 9 down to 1.

We can try a=9 first, see if we can find suitable b, c, d.

So, let's set a=9.

Compute b, c, d modulo7.

Compute b ≡3*9 -2=27-2=25≡4 mod7. So b=4 +7k1.

But b is a digit, so 0<=b<=9.

So possible values for b when k1=0:4; k1=1:11, which is invalid. So b=4.

Similarly, c ≡2*9 -1=18-1=17≡3 mod7. So c=3 +7k2. Possible c:3,10,17,... but c must be ≤9. So c=3 or 10 is invalid. So c=3.

d ≡6*9 -5=54-5=49≡0 mod7. So d=0 +7k3. Possible d:0,7,14,... but d ≤9. So d=0 or7.

So, d can be 0 or7.

Now, let's check if these values satisfy the original equations.

So, a=9, b=4, c=3, d can be 0 or7.

So, let's first try d=7.

So N=9437.

Now, let's check the four conditions.

Replace a with1:1437. Check if 1437 divisible by7.

Compute 1437 /7: 7*205=1435, 1437-1435=2. Not divisible. So this condition fails.

Wait, that's a problem.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the approach.

Wait, when a=9, b=4, c=3, d=7, the condition when changing a to1 gives 1437, which should be divisible by7. But 1437 divided by7 is 205.285..., which is not an integer. So, this N=9437 doesn't satisfy the condition.

Hmm. So, maybe d=0?

Let's try d=0.

So N=9430.

Check replacing a with1:1430.

1430 /7: 7*204=1428, 1430-1428=2. Again, not divisible by7.

Hmm, that's also not good.

Wait, so perhaps a=9 is not possible.

Wait, but why? Did I compute the congruences correctly?

Let me check the equations again.

Wait, when a=9, the calculations were:

b ≡3*9 -2=25≡4 mod7, so b=4.

c≡2*9 -1=17≡3 mod7, c=3.

d ≡6*9 -5=49≡0 mod7, so d=0 or7.

But when I plug d=7 into N=9437, changing a to1 gives 1437, which is 1437 mod7.

Wait, let's compute 1437 mod7.

Compute 1437 ÷7:

7*205=1435, so 1437-1435=2. So 1437≡2 mod7. That's not 0, so condition fails.

Similarly, for N=9430, changing a to1 gives 1430.

1430 ÷7: 7*204=1428, 1430-1428=2. So 1430≡2 mod7. Not 0.

Hmm, so a=9 is invalid.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in setting a=9. Let's try a=8.

So a=8.

Compute b=3*8 -2=24-2=22≡1 mod7. So b=1 +7k1.

Possible b:1,8,15,... but b must be ≤9, so b=1 or8.

Similarly, c=2*8 -1=16-1=15≡1 mod7. So c=1 +7k2: possible c=1,8.

d=6*8 -5=48-5=43≡1 mod7 (since 43 ÷7 is 6*7=42, 43-42=1). So d=1 +7k3: possible d=1,8.

So now, N could be 8b c d, with b=1 or8, c=1 or8, d=1 or8.

We need to choose the largest possible N, so we choose the largest possible digits.

So, b=8, c=8, d=8. So N=8888.

Wait, let's check if this satisfies the conditions.

Changing any digit to1:

- Change first digit to1:1888. Check if 1888 is divisible by7.

Compute 1888 ÷7: 7*269=1883, 1888-1883=5. Not divisible by7.

So, condition fails.

Wait, so that's not good. Let's try another combination.

Wait, perhaps b=8, c=8, d=1.

N=8881.

Check changing a=8 to1:1881.

1881 ÷7: 7*268=1876, 1881-1876=5. Not divisible by7.

Hmm.

Maybe try b=8, c=1, d=8: N=8818.

Change a=8 to1:1818.

1818 ÷7: 7*259=1813, 1818-1813=5. Not divisible.

Alternatively, maybe b=1, c=1, d=1: N=8111.

Changing a=8 to1:1111.

1111 ÷7: 7*158=1106, 1111-1106=5. Not divisible.

Hmm, none of these seem to work. Maybe a=8 is invalid.

Wait, perhaps I need to compute more carefully. Let's choose N=8188.

Wait, or perhaps my approach is flawed. Maybe I should check each possible a from 9 down, and for each a, compute the possible b, c, d, and then check all four conditions.

Alternatively, perhaps there's a smarter way.

Wait, let's think about the four conditions again.

Each of N1, N2, N3, N4 must be divisible by7.

But N1 is when a is replaced by1, so N1 = 1000 + 100b +10c +d.

Similarly, N2 is when b is replaced by1:1000a +100 +10c +d.

N3 is when c is replaced by1:1000a +100b +10 +d.

N4 is when d is replaced by1:1000a +100b +10c +1.

Each must be divisible by7.

So, perhaps for each a from9 down, I can compute possible b, c, d, ensuring that all four conditions are satisfied.

But this seems time-consuming, but perhaps manageable.

Alternatively, maybe I can express N in terms of a, b, c, d and find some relation.

Wait, another thought: N itself, when you replace any digit with1, becomes divisible by7. So, N is such that N - (digit -1)*10^k is divisible by7, for each digit position k=0,1,2,3.

Wait, more precisely, when you change the digit at position k (where position 0 is units, 1 is tens, etc.) from D to1, the number becomes N - D*10^k +1*10^k.

So, the difference is (1 - D)*10^k.

So, (N - (D -1)*10^k ) must be divisible by7.

Wait, that might not be the exact way to express it, but the idea is that the modified number is N - (digit)*10^k +1*10^k.

So, N - (digit)*10^k +10^k = N + (1 - digit)*10^k.

So, N + (1 - digit)*10^k ≡0 mod7.

So, for each digit, N ≡ (digit -1)*10^k mod7.

Wait, let me make sure.

If the modified number is N', then N' = N + (1 - digit)*10^k.

And N' ≡0 mod7.

So, N + (1 - digit)*10^k ≡0 mod7.

So, N ≡ (digit -1)*10^k mod7.

That's correct.

So, for each digit position k=0,1,2,3, N must be ≡ (digit -1)*10^k mod7.

Wait, that's an interesting way to model it. So, for each digit Dk at position k, we have N ≡ (Dk -1)*10^k mod7.

So, for each k=0,1,2,3, N ≡ (Dk -1)*10^k mod7.

So, that gives us four congruences:

1. N ≡ (a -1)*10^3 mod7.

2. N ≡ (b -1)*10^2 mod7.

3. N ≡ (c -1)*10^1 mod7.

4. N ≡ (d -1)*10^0 mod7.

But wait, 10^k mod7 has a cycle. Let's compute 10^k mod7 for k=0,1,2,3.

10^0 mod7=1.

10^1 mod7=3.

10^2 mod7=2.

10^3 mod7=6.

So,

1. N ≡ (a-1)*6 mod7.

2. N ≡ (b-1)*2 mod7.

3. N ≡ (c-1)*3 mod7.

4. N ≡ (d-1)*1 mod7.

So, now we have four congruences:

Equation1: N ≡6(a-1) mod7.

Equation2: N ≡2(b-1) mod7.

Equation3: N ≡3(c-1) mod7.

Equation4: N ≡1*(d-1) mod7.

But N is equal to 1000a + 100b +10c +d.

So, N ≡ (1000a + 100b +10c +d) mod7.

Earlier, we found that 1000≡6, 100≡2, 10≡3, 1≡1 mod7.

So, N ≡6a +2b +3c +d mod7.

So, we have N ≡6a +2b +3c +d mod7.

So, from the four congruences:

6a +2b +3c +d ≡6(a-1) mod7. (Equation A)

6a +2b +3c +d ≡2(b-1) mod7. (Equation B)

6a +2b +3c +d ≡3(c-1) mod7. (Equation C)

6a +2b +3c +d ≡d -1 mod7. (Equation D)

Let me process each equation.

Equation A: 6a +2b +3c +d ≡6a -6 mod7.

Subtract 6a from both sides: 2b +3c +d ≡-6 mod7.

Which is same as 2b +3c +d ≡1 mod7 (since -6 ≡1 mod7).

Similarly, Equation B:6a +2b +3c +d ≡2b -2 mod7.

Subtract 2b:6a +3c +d ≡-2 mod7.

Which is 6a +3c +d ≡5 mod7.

Equation C:6a +2b +3c +d ≡3c -3 mod7.

Subtract 3c:6a +2b +d ≡-3 mod7.

Which is 6a +2b +d ≡4 mod7.

Equation D:6a +2b +3c +d ≡d -1 mod7.

Subtract d:6a +2b +3c ≡-1 mod7.

Which is 6a +2b +3c ≡6 mod7.

So now, the four equations are:

A:2b +3c +d ≡1 mod7.

B:6a +3c +d ≡5 mod7.

C:6a +2b +d ≡4 mod7.

D:6a +2b +3c ≡6 mod7.

Hmm, that's similar to the equations I had before, but let's see if we can solve these.

Perhaps subtract equation A from equation B:

Equation B -Equation A:

(6a +3c +d) - (2b +3c +d) =6a -2b ≡5 -1=4 mod7.

So, 6a -2b ≡4 mod7.

Which simplifies to 6a ≡2b +4 mod7.

Divide both sides by 2 (since 2 and7 are coprime, multiply by inverse 4):

3a ≡b + 2 mod7.

So, 3a -b ≡2 mod7. This is similar to before.

Similarly, subtract equation C from equation B:

Equation B - Equation C:

(6a +3c +d) - (6a +2b +d) =3c -2b ≡5-4=1 mod7.

So, 3c -2b ≡1 mod7. Same as before.

Subtract equation C from equation D:

Equation D -Equation C:

(6a +2b +3c) - (6a +2b +d) =3c -d ≡6 -4=2 mod7.

So, 3c -d ≡2 mod7. Same as before.

Equation D -Equation A:

(6a +2b +3c) - (2b +3c +d) =6a -d ≡6 -1=5 mod7.

So, 6a -d ≡5 mod7. Same as before.

So, same set of equations as before.

So, perhaps I can proceed as before.

From 3a -b ≡2 mod7, b ≡3a -2 mod7.

From 6a -d ≡5 mod7, d ≡6a -5 mod7.

From 3c -d ≡2 mod7, substituting d:3c - (6a -5) ≡2 mod7.

Which is 3c -6a +5 ≡2 mod7.

3c -6a ≡-3 mod7.

Which is 3c -6a ≡4 mod7.

Factor 3: 3(c -2a) ≡4 mod7.

Multiply both sides by inverse of3 mod7, which is5.

So, (c -2a) ≡4*5=20≡6 mod7.

So, c ≡2a +6 mod7.

Wait, earlier I thought c ≡2a -1 mod7. Let me check.

Wait, in previous steps, I had:

From 3c -d ≡2 mod7 and d=6a-5 mod7,

3c - (6a -5) ≡2 mod7,

3c -6a +5 ≡2,

3c -6a ≡-3,

3(c -2a) ≡4 mod7,

Then c -2a ≡(4 * 5) mod7 (since 3*5=15≡1 mod7).

So c -2a ≡20 mod7→20-14=6 mod7.

So, c ≡2a +6 mod7.

Wait, earlier I thought c=2a-1, but that was perhaps a mistake.

Wait, let me get back. So, now from this, c≡2a+6 mod7.

Which is same as c≡2a-1 mod7, since 6≡-1 mod7. Because 2a+6=2a-1 mod7.

Yes, because 6=7-1→6≡-1 mod7.

So, c≡2a -1 mod7.

So, correct.

So, c=2a -1 +7k2.

Similarly, from 3c -2b ≡1 mod7, we have that equation was satisfied when substituting b and c in terms of a.

So, no new information there.

So, now, for each a from9 down, we can compute b, c, d in terms of a.

So, let's try a=9.

b=3a -2 mod7: 3*9=27-2=25≡25-21=4 mod7. So, b=4 +7k1.

c=2a -1 mod7=18-1=17≡3 mod7. So, c=3 +7k2.

d=6a -5 mod7=54-5=49≡0 mod7. So, d=0 +7k3.

So, possible values:

b:4 or 11 (invalid), so b=4.

c:3 or10 (invalid), so c=3.

d:0 or7 or14 (invalid). So, d=0 or7.

So, N is 9430 or 9437.

But earlier, when I tried N=9437, it didn't satisfy the condition when a is replaced with1.

Wait, let's double-check.

For N=9437:

Changing a to1 gives 1437.

Compute 1437 mod7: 1437 ÷7=205*7=1435, remainder2. So, 1437≡2 mod7. Not divisible.

Similarly, for N=9430:

Changing a to1 gives 1430.

1430 mod7: 1430-7*204=1430-1428=2. So, 1430≡2 mod7. Not divisible.

Hmm, so a=9 doesn't work.

Next, a=8.

Compute:

b=3*8 -2=24-2=22≡1 mod7. So, b=1 or8.

c=2*8 -1=16-1=15≡1 mod7. So, c=1 or8.

d=6*8 -5=48-5=43≡1 mod7. So, d=1 or8.

So, N could be 8b c d, with b=1 or8, c=1 or8, d=1 or8.

We want the largest possible N, so set b=8, c=8, d=8. So N=8888.

Check if this satisfies the conditions.

Change a=8 to1:1888.

1888 ÷7=269.714... 7*269=1883, 1888-1883=5. So, 1888≡5 mod7. Not divisible.

So, this doesn't work.

Next, try N=8881.

Change a=8 to1:1881.

1881 ÷7: 7*268=1876, 1881-1876=5. Not divisible.

Hmm.

Try N=8818.

Change a=8 to1:1818.

1818 ÷7: 7*259=1813, 1818-1813=5. Not divisible.

Same result.

Alternatively, N=8188.

Change a=8 to1:1188.

1188 ÷7: 7*169=1183, 1188-1183=5. Not divisible.

Hmm.

Let me try another combination: b=8, c=1, d=8: N=8818. Already tried.

Alternatively, b=8, c=1, d=1: N=8811.

Change a=8 to1:1811.

1811 ÷7: 7*258=1806, 1811-1806=5. Not divisible.

Hmm.

Maybe b=1, c=8, d=8: N=8188.

Change a=8 to1:1188. As before, 1188 mod7=5.

Not good.

Alternatively, N=8118.

Change a=8 to1:1118.

1118 ÷7: 7*159=1113, 1118-1113=5. Not divisible.

Hmm.

Perhaps a=8 is invalid. Let's try a=7.

a=7.

Compute:

b=3*7 -2=21-2=19≡5 mod7. So, b=5 or12 (invalid). So, b=5.

c=2*7 -1=14-1=13≡6 mod7. So, c=6 or13 (invalid). So, c=6.

d=6*7 -5=42-5=37≡2 mod7. So, d=2 or9.

So, d can be2 or9.

So, possible N=7562 or7569.

Check N=7569.

Change a=7 to1:1569.

Compute 1569 ÷7: 7*224=1568, 1569-1568=1. So, 1569≡1 mod7. Not divisible.

Change a=7 to1:1569≡1 mod7. Not good.

Next, N=7562.

Change a=7 to1:1562.

1562 ÷7: 7*223=1561, 1562-1561=1. So, 1562≡1 mod7. Not divisible.

Hmm, so a=7 not working.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me check the equations again.

Wait, for a=7:

b=5, c=6, d=2 or9.

So, N=7562 or7569.

Check N=7569.

Changing a=7 to1:1569.

1569 mod7: 7*224=1568, so 1569-1568=1. Not divisible.

Changing b=5 to1:7169.

Compute 7169 ÷7: 7*1024=7168, 7169-7168=1. Not divisible.

Hmm, seems not working.

Alternatively, perhaps I should check all four conditions for N=7569.

Wait, for N=7569:

Changing a to1:1569≡1 mod7.

Changing b to1:7169≡1 mod7.

Changing c to1:7519.

7519 ÷7: 7*1074=7518, 7519-7518=1.≡1 mod7.

Changing d to1:7561.

7561 ÷7: 7*1080=7560, 7561-7560=1.≡1 mod7.

So, all four modified numbers ≡1 mod7. So, none are 0 mod7. So, N=7569 doesn't satisfy the condition.

Similarly, N=7562.

Changing a=7→1:1562≡1 mod7.

Same issue.

Hmm.

Let me proceed to a=6.

a=6.

Compute:

b=3*6 -2=18-2=16≡2 mod7. So, b=2 or9.

c=2*6 -1=12-1=11≡4 mod7. So, c=4 or11 (invalid). So, c=4.

d=6*6 -5=36-5=31≡3 mod7. So, d=3 or10 (invalid). So, d=3.

So, possible N=6b43, with b=2 or9.

So, N=6943 or6243.

Check N=6943.

Change a=6→1:1943.

Compute 1943 ÷7: 7*277=1939, 1943-1939=4. So, 1943≡4 mod7. Not 0.

Change b=9→1:6143.

6143 ÷7: 7*877=6139, 6143-6139=4.≡4 mod7. Not good.

Change c=4→1:6913.

6913 ÷7: 7*987=6909, 6913-6909=4.≡4 mod7. Not good.

Change d=3→1:6941.

6941 ÷7: 7*991=6937, 6941-6937=4.≡4 mod7. Not good.

Hmm, doesn't work.

Next, N=6243.

Change a=6→1:1243.

1243 ÷7: 7*177=1239, 1243-1239=4.≡4 mod7. Not good.

Same issue.

So, a=6 invalid.

Proceed to a=5.

a=5.

Compute:

b=3*5 -2=15-2=13≡6 mod7. So, b=6 or13 (invalid). So, b=6.

c=2*5 -1=10-1=9≡2 mod7. So, c=2 or9.

d=6*5 -5=30-5=25≡4 mod7. So, d=4 or11 (invalid). So, d=4.

So, possible N=56c4, with c=2 or9.

So, N=5694 or5624.

Check N=5694.

Change a=5→1:1694.

1694 ÷7: 7*242=1694. So, 1694=7*242. So, divisible by7. Good.

Change b=6→1:5194.

5194 ÷7: 7*742=5194. Exactly. So, divisible.

Change c=9→1:5614.

5614 ÷7: 7*802=5614. Exactly.

Change d=4→1:5691.

5691 ÷7: 7*813=5691. Exactly.

Wait, that's all four conditions satisfied!

Wait, really?

Wait, let me double-check.

N=5694.

Changing a=5→1:1694. 1694 ÷7=242, which is exact. So, yes.

Changing b=6→1:5194. 5194 ÷7=742, exact.

Changing c=9→1:5614. 5614 ÷7=802, exact.

Changing d=4→1:5691. 5691 ÷7=813, exact.

So, all four modified numbers are divisible by7. So, N=5694 satisfies the condition.

But wait, is this the largest possible N?

Wait, earlier, a=5 gives N=5694, but we tried a=9,8,7,6, which didn't satisfy the conditions. So, 5694 is a candidate.

But wait, let's see if there's a larger N. Because a=5 is less than 6,7, etc., but maybe a=5, but higher b, c, d.

Wait, earlier for a=5, possible N=5694 or5624. 5694 is larger.

But perhaps I can check a=5, but with higher digits.

Wait, for a=5, b=6, c=9, d=4 is the maximum possible.

But perhaps when a=5, c can be higher?

Wait, c=2 or9. So, 9 is higher, so N=5694.

Is there a higher N with a=5?

Wait, if I set c=9 and d=4, that's the highest possible for a=5.

But maybe if I set b=6, c=9, d=4, that's the maximum for a=5.

But perhaps, are there higher a's that might work?

Wait, I tried a=9,8,7,6 and none worked. So, perhaps 5694 is the maximum.

But wait, wait, wait. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps I made a miscalculation earlier.

Wait, when a=5, N=5694.

But perhaps, for a=5, could I have a higher N? For example, if c=9 and d=4, but perhaps if I set d=4, but is there a higher d?

No, d=4 is fixed by d=6a-5 mod7.

Wait, a=5: d=6*5-5=25≡4 mod7. So, d=4 or11 (invalid). So, d=4.

Similarly, c=2a-1=10-1=9≡2 mod7. Wait, 2a-1=9, which is 9≡2 mod7. So, c=9 or16 (invalid). So, c=9.

Similarly, b=3a-2=15-2=13≡6 mod7. So, b=6 or13 (invalid). So, b=6.

So, N=5694 is the only possible N when a=5.

But wait, let me check if a=5 is the maximum possible.

Wait, I tried a=9,8,7,6 and they didn't work, so the next is a=5.

Wait, perhaps I can check if a=4 gives a higher N than a=5.

Wait, no. Because a=5 is higher than a=4, so N=5xxx is higher than N=4xxx.

So, 5694 is the maximum possible N.

Wait, but wait, let me check a=5, b=6, c=9, d=4: N=5694.

But I can try a=5, but with higher digits.

Wait, can I have b=6, which is the maximum for a=5, and c=9, which is the maximum, and d=4, which is maximum for d.

So, N=5694 is the maximum possible for a=5.

So, perhaps that's our N.

Wait, but let me make sure there are no higher N with a=5, perhaps with higher digits in b, c, d.

Wait, no, because for a=5:

b=6 is the maximum possible (since b=6 or13, but 13 is invalid).

c=9 is the maximum possible (since c=2 or9).

d=4 is the maximum possible.

So, N=5694 is the maximum possible for a=5.

So, perhaps that's the answer.

But wait, let me check if N=5694 is indeed the correct answer.

Wait, when I change any digit to1, the number becomes divisible by7.

As I checked earlier:

Change a=5 to1:1694, which is 7*242=1694. Good.

Change b=6 to1:5194, which is 7*742=5194. Good.

Change c=9 to1:5614, which is 7*802=5614. Good.

Change d=4 to1:5691, which is 7*813=5691. Good.

So, all four modified numbers are divisible by7. So, N=5694 is valid.

But wait, let me check a=5, but maybe a higher N is possible with a=5, but higher digits.

Wait, N=5694 is 5694.

Is there a higher N with a=5? Like 5999 or something.

Wait, no, because when a=5, the maximum possible b is6, c=9, d=4.

So, N=5694 is the maximum for a=5.

But wait, maybe I can find a higher N with a=5 but different digits.

Wait, for example, if b=6, c=9, d=4: N=5694.

Alternatively, could I have a=5, b=6, c=9, d=4: yes, that's the maximum.

Wait, but maybe I can have a higher N by setting a=5, but b=6, c=9, d=4.

Wait, that's the maximum for a=5.

So, N=5694 is our candidate.

Now, let's check if there's any higher N with a=5.

Wait, for a=5, N=5694 is the maximum.

Wait, but perhaps a=5, b=6, c=9, d=4 is the only possible N.

So, perhaps 5694 is our answer.

But wait, before finalizing, let me check if a=5 is indeed the maximum.

Wait, a=6,7,8,9 didn't work, so a=5 is the highest possible a that works.

So, N=5694.

Wait, but wait, let me check if there's a higher N with a=5 but with b, c, d as 9s.

Wait, for a=5, b=6, c=9, d=4. So, perhaps if I can increase d beyond4, but d is fixed to4 because 6a-5 mod7=25≡4 mod7.

So, d=4 or11 (invalid). So, d=4.

So, no, I can't have d=9.

So, N=5694 is the maximum.

But wait, let me check a=5, b=6, c=9, d=4: N=5694.

Now, Q is the quotient when N is divided by1000, so Q=5, and R is the remainder when divided by1000, which is694.

So, Q+R=5+694=699.

But let me make sure.

Wait, N=5694.

N divided by1000 is5, remainder694.

So, Q=5, R=694.

So, Q+R=5+694=699.

But wait, let me check if N=5694 is indeed the correct answer.

Wait, I think I might have made a mistake because when I tried a=5, I found N=5694, but I thought a=9,8,7,6 didn't work, but perhaps I made a mistake in their calculations.

Wait, let me double-check a=9,8,7,6.

For a=9:

b=4, c=3, d=0 or7.

N=9430 or9437.

Changing a=9→1:1430 or1437.

1430 mod7=2, 1437 mod7=2. So, not 0.

So, no good.

a=8:

b=1 or8, c=1 or8, d=1 or8.

We tried N=8888, but changing a=8→1:1888≡5 mod7.

No good.

a=7:

b=5, c=6, d=2 or9.

N=7562 or7569.

Changing a=7→1:1562 or1569.

1562 mod7=1, 1569 mod7=1.

Not 0.

a=6:

b=2 or9, c=4, d=3.

N=6943 or6243.

Changing a=6→1:1943 or1243.

1943 mod7=4, 1243 mod7=4.

Not 0.

So, yes, a=5 is the highest possible a that works, giving N=5694.

Thus, Q=5, R=694, Q+R=699.

Wait, but the problem says "the greatest four-digit positive integer", so 5694 is the answer.

But wait, let me confirm once more.

Wait, perhaps there's a higher N with a=5, but with higher digits in b, c, d.

Wait, for a=5:

b=6, c=9, d=4: N=5694.

Wait, is there any way to make N higher with a=5?

If I set b=6, c=9, d=4, that's the maximum possible for a=5.

So, I think 5694 is the correct answer.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The greatest four-digit number \( N \) that satisfies the given condition is 5694. When \( N \) is divided by 1000, the quotient \( Q \) is 5 and the remainder \( R \) is 694. Therefore, \( Q + R = 5 + 694 = 699 \).

\boxed{699}
