Okay, so I have this problem here about b-eautiful numbers. Let me try to understand what it's asking for. 

First, the problem defines a positive integer n as b-eautiful if two conditions are met: when n is written in base b, it has exactly two digits. And the sum of these two digits equals the square root of n. An example is given: 81 is 13-beautiful because in base 13, it's written as 63, and 6 + 3 equals 9, which is the square root of 81.

So, I need to find the least integer b (where b is at least 2) such that there are more than ten b-eautiful integers. Hmm, okay. That means I need to find the smallest base where there are over ten numbers that satisfy this condition.

Let me break down the problem. A two-digit number in base b can be written as n = a * b + c, where a and c are the digits. Since it's a two-digit number, a can't be zero, so a is between 1 and b-1, and c is between 0 and b-1.

The sum of the digits is a + c, and this sum should equal sqrt(n). So, sqrt(n) = a + c. Therefore, n = (a + c)^2.

But n is also equal to a*b + c. So, (a + c)^2 = a*b + c. Let me write that equation:

(a + c)^2 = a*b + c.

I need to find all possible a and c for a given base b such that this equation holds. Then, for each b, count how many such numbers n exist. The goal is to find the smallest b where this count exceeds ten.

Let me rearrange this equation to make it easier to handle. Expanding the left side:

a^2 + 2*a*c + c^2 = a*b + c.

Let me bring everything to one side:

a^2 + 2*a*c + c^2 - a*b - c = 0.

Hmm, maybe it's better to group terms differently. Let's see:

a^2 + (2c - b)*a + (c^2 - c) = 0.

This is a quadratic equation in terms of a. So for each base b, and for each possible c, I can solve for a.

Wait, but a and c must be integers, right? Since they are digits in base b.

So, for each b, I can iterate through possible c values (from 0 to b-1, but since a must be at least 1, c can be 0), and for each c, solve the quadratic equation for a. Then check if a is an integer within the valid range (1 to b-1). If yes, then that's a valid pair (a, c), and hence a valid n.

Alternatively, I might think of this equation differently. Let me consider that n is a two-digit number in base b, so n is between b and b^2 - 1. Wait, no, the two-digit numbers in base b start from b (which is 10_b) up to (b-1)(b-1)_b, which is (b-1)*b + (b-1) = b^2 - 1. So n must satisfy b <= n <= b^2 - 1.

But n is also equal to (a + c)^2. So, (a + c)^2 must be between b and b^2 - 1. So, sqrt(b) <= a + c <= sqrt(b^2 - 1). Since a and c are digits, a + c can vary from 1 + 0 = 1 up to (b-1) + (b-1) = 2b - 2. But since n must be at least b, (a + c)^2 >= b, so a + c >= sqrt(b). 

But b is at least 2, so sqrt(b) is at least sqrt(2), which is about 1.414. So a + c must be at least 2 since a + c is an integer. Therefore, a + c >= 2.

Wait, but n is (a + c)^2, and n must be a two-digit number in base b, so n must be between b and b^2 - 1. So, (a + c)^2 must be >= b and <= b^2 - 1.

So for each b, the possible values of s = a + c are integers such that sqrt(b) <= s <= sqrt(b^2 - 1). But sqrt(b^2 - 1) is just less than b. So s must satisfy 2 <= s <= b - 1, since for b >= 2, sqrt(b^2 - 1) is less than b.

Wait, let's compute sqrt(b^2 - 1). For example, when b is 2, sqrt(3) is about 1.732, so s must be at least 2. So s can be 2 only. For b = 3, sqrt(8) is about 2.828, so s can be 2 or 3. Since 3 <= sqrt(b^2 - 1) is 3 <= 2.828? No, that's not right. Wait, no, for b=3, sqrt(b^2 -1) is sqrt(8) ≈2.828, so s must be up to 2. So s can be 2.

Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me think again.

Given that n is a two-digit number in base b, which is between b and b^2 -1. So (a + c)^2 is between b and b^2 -1.

Therefore, the square of s = a + c is between b and b^2 -1.

So s must satisfy sqrt(b) <= s <= sqrt(b^2 -1).

But sqrt(b^2 -1) is less than b, because (b)^2 = b^2, so sqrt(b^2 -1) = b * sqrt(1 - 1/b²) ≈ b - 1/(2b) for large b.

Therefore, s must be an integer in the range [sqrt(b), b - 1/(2b)]. But since s is integer, s can be from ceiling(sqrt(b)) up to floor(sqrt(b^2 -1)).

But let's compute sqrt(b^2 -1). For integer b, sqrt(b^2 -1) is just less than b.

So, if s is integer, then s can be from ceiling(sqrt(b)) up to b - 1.

Wait, but if b is an integer >=2, then s can be from 2 up to b -1, because for b=2, sqrt(2) ≈1.414, so s starts at 2. For b=3, sqrt(3)≈1.732, so s starts at 2. Hmm, but 3^2 -1=8, sqrt(8)=2.828, so s can be 2.

Wait, that can't be right because for b=3, n must be a two-digit number, so n is between 3 and 8. Therefore, s^2 must be between 3 and 8. So s can be 2 or 3 because 2^2=4, 3^2=9. Wait, 9 is larger than 8, so s can only be 2. So for b=3, s=2.

Wait, this is conflicting with earlier thoughts. Let me compute for b=3:

n must be in 3 <= n <= 8.

s must satisfy s^2 >=3 and <=8.

So s can be 2 because 2^2=4, which is in 3-8. 3^2=9, which is larger than 8, so s can't be 3. So s=2 is the only possibility.

Wait, but then n=4. So in base 3, 4 is written as 11 (since 1*3 +1=4), so a=1, c=1, sum is 2, which is sqrt(4). So that works.

So for b=3, only one b-eautiful number: 4.

Wait, but the problem says the example is b=13, n=81=63_13, which is a=6, c=3, sum=9, sqrt(81)=9.

So, in that case, s=9, which is less than b=13.

So, perhaps for a base b, s can range from 2 up to s_max, where s_max is the largest integer s such that s^2 <= b^2 -1.

But s_max = floor(sqrt(b^2 -1)).

But sqrt(b^2 -1) is less than b, so s_max is b-1.

Wait, for example, when b=13, s_max is sqrt(13^2 -1)=sqrt(168)=12.96, so floor(12.96)=12. So s can go up to 12.

But wait, 12^2=144. But in base 13, n=144 is a three-digit number (since 13^2=169, which is greater than 144). So 144 is two digits in base 13: 11*13 + 1=144? Wait, 11*13=143, plus 1 is 144, so yes, it's two digits: 11 1 in base 13. So 144 is a two-digit number in base 13, but 144 is less than 13^2=169. So for b=13, s can be up to 12.

Wait, but for b=2, n must be between 2 and 3 (since two-digit numbers in base 2 are 10 (2) and 11 (3)). So s^2 must be between 2 and 3. So s can be 2, because 2^2=4 is too big. Wait, that's confusing.

Hold on, perhaps I've made a mistake. Let's clarify:

For a base b, the two-digit numbers range from b (which is 10_b) to (b-1)(b-1)_b, which is (b-1)*b + (b-1) = b^2 -1.

So for b=2, n must be between 2 and 3. So (a + c)^2 must be in [2,3]. But the squares of integers are 1,4,9... So no integer s satisfies s^2 in [2,3]. Therefore, for b=2, there are no b-eautiful numbers.

Wait, that's a problem. So maybe the initial statement in the problem is that n is a positive integer. So for b=2, there are no such numbers because s^2 can't be in [2,3]. So for b=2, zero numbers. Similarly, for b=3, s must be 2 because n=4 is the only possible.

I think I need a better approach. Let's go back to the equation:

(a + c)^2 = a*b + c.

I can rearrange this as:

(a + c)^2 - c = a*b.

So,

b = [(a + c)^2 - c]/a.

Since b must be an integer, [(a + c)^2 - c] must be divisible by a.

So, for given a and c, we can compute b as ( (a + c)^2 - c ) / a.

But b must also be an integer greater than or equal to the maximum of a and c +1. Because in base b, a is a digit, so a < b, and c is a digit, so c < b. Since a is at least 1, b must be at least a +1. Similarly, c must be less than b.

So, for each a and c, we can compute b as above and check if b > a and b > c.

Wait, but a and c are digits in base b, so a < b and c < b.

But if we have a and c, and compute b in terms of a and c, then b must be greater than both a and c.

Hmm, but this seems a bit abstract. Maybe it's better to fix b and find all possible a and c.

But since we need to find the minimal b where the number of solutions exceeds ten, perhaps I can find for each b, how many pairs (a, c) satisfy (a + c)^2 = a*b + c.

Alternatively, I can represent this as:

Let s = a + c.

Then, n = s^2 = a*b + c.

But since s = a + c, we can write c = s - a.

Substituting into the equation:

s^2 = a*b + (s - a).

Simplify:

s^2 = a*b + s - a.

Rearrange:

s^2 - s = a*(b - 1).

So,

a = (s^2 - s)/(b - 1).

Since a must be an integer between 1 and b - 1, and c = s - a must be between 0 and b -1.

So, for each b, and for each s where s^2 is a two-digit number in base b, we can compute a as (s^2 - s)/(b - 1). Then check if a is an integer, and whether c = s - a is a valid digit (i.e., 0 <= c < b).

Wait, but s itself is a function of b because n = s^2 must be a two-digit number in base b, so n is between b and b^2 -1. So s must satisfy sqrt(b) <= s <= sqrt(b^2 - 1). But as I thought earlier, sqrt(b^2 -1) is less than b, so s must be less than b.

So for a given b, s can range from ceiling(sqrt(b)) up to floor(sqrt(b^2 -1)).

But since sqrt(b^2 -1) is less than b, the maximum integer s can be is b -1.

Wait, for example, if b=13, then sqrt(13^2 -1)=sqrt(168)=~12.96, so s can be up to 12.

So, for each b, s can range from 2 up to b -1 (since s must be at least 2 because n must be at least b >= 2, and s^2 >= b).

But wait, when b=4, sqrt(b)=2, so s starts at 2. For b=5, sqrt(b)=~2.236, so s starts at 3.

Wait, no, because n must be a two-digit number in base b, so n is between b and b^2 -1. So s must be such that s^2 is in [b, b^2 -1].

So, s must be at least ceiling(sqrt(b)).

So, for each b, s ranges from ceiling(sqrt(b)) to floor(sqrt(b^2 -1)).

Which is from ceiling(sqrt(b)) to b -1.

So, for each b, s can take on values from s_min = ceiling(sqrt(b)) up to s_max = b -1.

So, for each such s, we can compute a as (s^2 - s)/(b -1). Then, check if a is an integer, 1 <= a <= b -1, and c = s - a is between 0 and b -1.

If all these conditions are met, then that (a, c) pair is valid, and n = s^2 is a b-eautiful number.

So, the plan is:

1. For each base b starting from 2 upwards:
   a. Compute s_min = ceiling(sqrt(b)).
   b. s_max = b -1.
   c. For each s from s_min to s_max:
      i. Compute a = (s^2 - s)/(b - 1).
      ii. Check if a is an integer.
      iii. Check if a is between 1 and b -1.
      iv. Compute c = s - a.
      v. Check if c is between 0 and b -1.
      vi. If all conditions are met, count this as a valid b-eautiful number.
   d. After checking all s for this b, record the count.
2. Find the smallest b where the count exceeds ten.

So, I need to implement this process step by step.

Let me try to compute the number of b-eautiful numbers for small b to see the pattern.

Starting with b=2:

- s_min = ceiling(sqrt(2)) = 2.
- s_max = 1. So, since s_min > s_max, no numbers. So count=0.

b=3:

- s_min=ceiling(sqrt(3))=2.
- s_max=2.
- s=2:
   a=(4 -2)/(3-1)=2/2=1.
   a=1 is valid (1 <= a <=2).
   c=2 -1=1, which is <=2.
   So, n=4 is 11_3, which is valid.

So, count=1.

b=4:

- s_min=ceiling(sqrt(4))=2.
- s_max=3.
- s=2:
   a=(4 -2)/(4-1)=2/3, not integer. So invalid.
- s=3:
   a=(9 -3)/(4-1)=6/3=2.
   a=2 <=3.
   c=3-2=1 <=3.
   So, n=9 is 21_4 (2*4 +1=9). Valid.
   So count=1.

b=5:

- s_min=ceiling(sqrt(5))=3.
- s_max=4.
- s=3:
   a=(9 -3)/(5-1)=6/4=1.5. Not integer.
- s=4:
   a=(16 -4)/4=12/4=3.
   a=3 <=4.
   c=4-3=1 <=4.
   So n=16 is 31_5 (3*5+1=16). Valid.
   So count=1.

b=6:

- s_min=ceiling(sqrt(6))=3.
- s_max=5.
- s=3:
   a=(9-3)/5=6/5=1.2. Not integer.
- s=4:
   a=(16-4)/5=12/5=2.4. Not integer.
- s=5:
   a=(25 -5)/5=20/5=4.
   a=4 <=5.
   c=5-4=1 <=5.
   So n=25 is 41_6 (4*6+1=25). Valid.
   So count=1.

b=7:

- s_min=ceiling(sqrt(7))=3.
- s_max=6.
- s=3:
   a=(9-3)/6=6/6=1.
   a=1 <=6.
   c=3-1=2 <=6.
   So n=9 is 12_7 (1*7 +2=9). Valid.
- s=4:
   a=(16 -4)/6=12/6=2.
   a=2 <=6.
   c=4-2=2 <=6.
   So n=16 is 22_7 (2*7 +2=16). Valid.
- s=5:
   a=(25 -5)/6=20/6≈3.333. Not integer.
- s=6:
   a=(36 -6)/6=30/6=5.
   a=5 <=6.
   c=6-5=1 <=6.
   So n=36 is 51_7 (5*7 +1=36). Valid.
   So total count=3.

Wait, so for b=7, count=3.

b=8:

- s_min=ceiling(sqrt(8))=3.
- s_max=7.
- s=3:
   a=(9-3)/7=6/7≈0.857. Not integer.
- s=4:
   a=(16 -4)/7=12/7≈1.714. Not integer.
- s=5:
   a=(25 -5)/7=20/7≈2.857. Not integer.
- s=6:
   a=(36 -6)/7=30/7≈4.285. Not integer.
- s=7:
   a=(49 -7)/7=42/7=6.
   a=6 <=7.
   c=7-6=1 <=7.
   So n=49 is 61_8 (6*8 +1=49). Valid.
   So count=1.

b=9:

- s_min=ceiling(sqrt(9))=3.
- s_max=8.
- s=3:
   a=(9-3)/8=6/8=0.75. Not integer.
- s=4:
   a=(16 -4)/8=12/8=1.5. Not integer.
- s=5:
   a=(25 -5)/8=20/8=2.5. Not integer.
- s=6:
   a=(36 -6)/8=30/8=3.75. Not integer.
- s=7:
   a=(49 -7)/8=42/8=5.25. Not integer.
- s=8:
   a=(64 -8)/8=56/8=7.
   a=7 <=8.
   c=8-7=1 <=8.
   So n=64 is 71_9 (7*9 +1=64). Valid.
   Count=1.

b=10:

- s_min=ceiling(sqrt(10))=4.
- s_max=9.
- s=4:
   a=(16 -4)/9=12/9=1.333. Not integer.
- s=5:
   a=(25 -5)/9=20/9≈2.222. Not integer.
- s=6:
   a=(36 -6)/9=30/9≈3.333. Not integer.
- s=7:
   a=(49 -7)/9=42/9≈4.666. Not integer.
- s=8:
   a=(64 -8)/9=56/9≈6.222. Not integer.
- s=9:
   a=(81 -9)/9=72/9=8.
   a=8 <=9.
   c=9 -8=1 <=9.
   So n=81 is 81_10 (but that's 8*10 +1=81). Wait, but 81 in base 10 is written as 81, which is two digits. So yes, that's valid.
   So count=1.

Wait, so for b=10, count=1.

Wait, but in the example given in the problem statement, 81 is 13-beautiful. So maybe for b=10, n=81 is also 10-beautiful. But wait, no, because 81 is a two-digit number in base 10, but in this case, a=8 and c=1. The sum a + c=9, which is sqrt(81). So, yes, it is 10-beautiful. So why did the problem mention 13? Because perhaps they were giving an example for a higher base where multiple digits can be used.

But in any case, moving on.

b=11:

- s_min=ceiling(sqrt(11))=4.
- s_max=10.
- s=4:
   a=(16 -4)/10=12/10=1.2. Not integer.
- s=5:
   a=(25 -5)/10=20/10=2.
   a=2 <=10.
   c=5 -2=3 <=10.
   So n=25 is 23_11 (2*11 +3=25). Valid.
- s=6:
   a=(36 -6)/10=30/10=3.
   a=3 <=10.
   c=6 -3=3 <=10.
   So n=36 is 33_11 (3*11 +3=36). Valid.

- s=10:
   a=(100 -10)/10=90/10=9.
   a=9 <=10.
   c=10 -9=1 <=10.
   So n=100 is 91_11 (9*11 +1=100). Valid.
   So total count=3.

So, for b=11, count=3.

b=12:

- s_min=ceiling(sqrt(12))=4.
- s_max=11.
- s=4:
   a=(16 -4)/11=12/11≈1.09. Not integer.

- s=9:
   a=(81 -9)/11=72/11≈6.545. Not integer.
- s=10:
   a=(100 -10)/11=90/11≈8.18. Not integer.
- s=11:
   a=(121 -11)/11=110/11=10.
   a=10 <=11.
   c=11 -10=1 <=11.
   So n=121 is 101_12 (10*12 +1=121). Valid.
   So count=1.

b=13:

- s_min=ceiling(sqrt(13))=4.
- s_max=12.
- s=4:
   a=(16 -4)/12=12/12=1.
   a=1 <=12.
   c=4 -1=3 <=12.
   So n=16 is 13_13 (Wait, 1*13 +3=16). So 13_13 is 16 in decimal. So valid.
- s=5:
   a=(25 -5)/12=20/12≈1.666. Not integer.
- s=6:
   a=(36 -6)/12=30/12=2.5. Not integer.

- s=9:
   a=(81 -9)/12=72/12=6.
   a=6 <=12.
   c=9 -6=3 <=12.
   So n=81 is 63_13 (6*13 +3=81). Valid. (This is the example given.)
- s=10:
   a=(100 -10)/12=90/12=7.5. Not integer.
- s=11:
   a=(121 -11)/12=110/12≈9.166. Not integer.
- s=12:
   a=(144 -12)/12=132/12=11.
   a=11 <=12.
   c=12 -11=1 <=12.
   So n=144 is 111_13 (11*13 +1=144). Valid.
   So, for b=13, count=3.

Wait, but I thought the example was for b=13. So n=81 is 13-beautiful, but in this calculation, I found three b=13-eautiful numbers: n=16,81,144. So count=3.

Continuing:

b=14:

- s_min=ceiling(sqrt(14))=4.
- s_max=13.
- s=4:
   a=(16 -4)/13=12/13≈0.923. Not integer.

- s=12:
   a=(144 -12)/13=132/13≈10.153. Not integer.
- s=13:
   a=(169 -13)/13=156/13=12.
   a=12 <=13.
   c=13 -12=1 <=13.
   So n=169 is 121_14 (12*14 +1=169). Valid.
   Count=1.

b=15:

- s_min=ceiling(sqrt(15))=4.
- s_max=14.
- s=4:
   a=(16 -4)/14=12/14≈0.857. Not integer.
- s=5:
   a=(25 -5)/14=20/14≈1.428. Not integer.
- s=6:
   a=(36 -6)/14=30/14≈2.142. Not integer.
- s=7:
   a=(49 -7)/14=42/14=3.
   a=3 <=14.
   c=7 -3=4 <=14.
   So n=49 is 34_15 (3*15 +4=49). Valid.
- s=8:
   a=(64 -8)/14=56/14=4.
   a=4 <=14.
   c=8 -4=4 <=14.
   So n=64 is 44_15 (4*15 +4=64). Valid.
- s=9:
   a=(81 -9)/14=72/14≈5.142. Not integer.
- s=10:
   a=(100 -10)/14=90/14≈6.428. Not integer.
- s=11:
   a=(121 -11)/14=110/14≈7.857. Not integer.
- s=12:
   a=(144 -12)/14=132/14≈9.428. Not integer.
- s=13:
   a=(169 -13)/14=156/14≈11.142. Not integer.
- s=14:
   a=(196 -14)/14=182/14=13.
   a=13 <=14.
   c=14 -13=1 <=14.
   So n=196 is 131_15 (13*15 +1=196). Valid.
   So count=3.

Hmm, so for b=15, count=3.

Wait, I'm seeing a pattern here. For each base b, the number of b-eautiful numbers is 1 or 3, depending on whether s^2 - s is divisible by b -1.

But the problem asks for the least b where the count exceeds ten. So ten is a big number. So, perhaps I need to look for a base where there are multiple s values that satisfy the condition, leading to multiple a and c pairs.

Alternatively, perhaps for certain bases, the equation has multiple solutions, maybe s and b are related in a way that s^2 - s is a multiple of b -1. So, if b-1 divides s(s-1), then a is integer.

So, b -1 must be a divisor of s(s -1).

Which means, for a given b, s(s -1) must be divisible by (b -1). So, if s and s -1 are consecutive integers, they are coprime. Therefore, (b -1) must divide the product s(s -1), which is the product of two consecutive integers.

Since s and s-1 are coprime, (b -1) must divide either s or s-1, or be a product of factors from each.

Wait, that's an important point. Since s and s-1 are coprime, any divisor of their product must divide s or s-1. So, in other words, (b -1) must be a product of factors where each factor divides either s or s-1.

But since s can vary, perhaps for some b, there are multiple s where (b-1) divides s(s-1).

Alternatively, if we can factor (b -1) as d1*d2, where d1 divides s and d2 divides s-1, then for each such factorization, we can get a value of s.

Wait, but maybe it's too abstract. Let me consider that for a given b, the number of s is equal to the number of divisors of (b -1) that can be expressed as s or s-1.

But this is getting complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps for certain bases, s can be written as multiples or something else. Wait, perhaps if b -1 is a factorial or something, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe to find a base where (b -1) has many small factors, which would allow for multiple s where s(s -1) is divisible by (b -1).

But I think I'm overcomplicating.

Let me try to think differently. For each s, a = (s^2 - s)/(b -1). So, for a to be integer, (s^2 - s) must be divisible by (b -1).

Which can be written as s(s -1) ≡ 0 mod (b -1).

So, for each s, (b -1) must divide s(s -1). So, for each s, b must be equivalent to 1 modulo the greatest common divisor of (b -1, s) and (b -1, s -1). Hmm, not sure.

Alternatively, for each s, b can be expressed as 1 + k, where k divides s(s -1).

So, b = 1 + k, where k | s(s -1).

Therefore, for each s, possible b's are 1 + divisors of s(s -1).

But since we're looking for the minimal b where there are more than ten b-eautiful numbers, perhaps I need to find a b where s(s -1) has many divisors, leading to multiple a's.

So, perhaps for a b where (b -1) is highly composite, meaning it has a lot of divisors, then the number of s's that satisfy the condition will be higher.

Therefore, to maximize the number of s's, we need (b -1) to be a number with many divisors.

So, let's think of highly composite numbers for (b -1). For example, 12, 24, 36, 60, 120, etc., are highly composite.

So, perhaps if we set b -1 = 12, which is a highly composite number, then b=13. Wait, but earlier for b=13, we found three numbers. So maybe 12 is not enough.

Wait, but when b=13, (b-1)=12. So, s must satisfy s(s-1) divisible by 12.

So, s(s -1) must be divisible by 12. So, s or s-1 must be divisible by 4, and one of them must be divisible by 3.

So, s can be congruent to 0 mod 4 or 1 mod 4, and also congruent to 0 mod 3 or 1 mod 3.

Let me compute the s's for b=13:

s must be in 4 to 12.

s=4: 4*3=12, which is divisible by 12. So yes.
s=5: 5*4=20. 20 mod 12 = 8. Not divisible.
s=6:6*5=30. 30 mod12=6. Not divisible.
s=7:7*6=42. 42 mod12=6. Not divisible.
s=8:8*7=56. 56 mod12=8. Not divisible.
s=9:9*8=72. 72 mod12=0. Yes.
s=10:10*9=90. 90 mod12=6. No.
s=11:11*10=110. 110 mod12=10. No.
s=12:12*11=132. 132 mod12=0. Yes.

So, s=4,9,12 are valid. So, 3 solutions, which matches the earlier count.

So, if I want more solutions, I need (b-1) to have more divisors, which allows s(s-1) to be divisible by (b-1) in more cases.

So, if I take a larger (b-1) with many small factors, maybe s(s-1) will be divisible by (b-1) for more s's.

For example, take (b-1)=24, which is highly composite.

Then, b=25.

Let's compute the count for b=25.

s_min=ceiling(sqrt(25))=5.

s_max=24.

For each s from 5 to 24, check if s(s-1) is divisible by 24.

s(s-1) must be divisible by 24. 24=8*3.

So, s or s-1 must be divisible by 8, and one of them must be divisible by 3.

So, s can be:

- s ≡0 mod8, and s ≡0 or 1 mod3.

Or,

- s ≡1 mod8, and s ≡0 or 1 mod3.

Wait, perhaps it's better to list all s where s(s-1) is divisible by 24.

s ranges from 5 to 24.

Let's list s where s or s-1 is divisible by 8, and s or s-1 divisible by 3.

Alternatively, s(s-1) must be divisible by 24.

Let me check each s:

s=5: 5*4=20. Not divisible by24.

s=6:6*5=30. 30/24=1.25. No.

s=7:7*6=42. 42/24=1.75. No.

s=8:8*7=56. 56/24≈2.333. No.

Wait, 56 /24=2 and 8/24. So no.

s=9:9*8=72. 72/24=3. Yes.

s=10:10*9=90. 90/24=3.75. No.

s=11:11*10=110. 110/24≈4.583. No.

s=12:12*11=132. 132/24=5.5. No.

s=13:13*12=156. 156/24=6.5. No.

s=14:14*13=182. 182/24≈7.583. No.

s=15:15*14=210. 210/24=8.75. No.

s=16:16*15=240. 240/24=10. Yes.

s=17:17*16=272. 272/24≈11.333. No.

s=18:18*17=306. 306/24=12.75. No.

s=19:19*18=342. 342/24=14.25. No.

s=20:20*19=380. 380/24≈15.833. No.

s=21:21*20=420. 420/24=17.5. No.

s=22:22*21=462. 462/24≈19.25. No.

s=23:23*22=506. 506/24≈21.083. No.

s=24:24*23=552. 552/24=23. Yes.

So, s=9,16,24.

So, three s's. So, count=3.

Hmm, not enough.

Wait, maybe I need a different approach. Perhaps, for a given (b-1), the number of s's is equal to the number of divisors of (b-1) that are less than or equal to s_max, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps for a given b, the number of solutions is equal to the number of divisors of (b-1) that are less than or equal to s_max, which is b -1.

Wait, but s_max is b-1.

Wait, for s from s_min to s_max, for each s, if (b-1) divides s(s-1), then it's a solution.

So, the number of s's is equal to the number of s in [s_min, s_max] such that s ≡0 or 1 mod (b-1)'s factors.

But this seems a bit vague.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to think that for each divisor d of (b-1), we can set s = d or s = d +1, and check if s is within the s_min and s_max.

Wait, for example, if (b-1) has divisors d1, d2, d3,..., then for each d, set s=d or s=d+1, and check if s is in the range.

But I'm not sure. Maybe I need to look for a b where (b-1) has many small divisors, allowing s(s-1) to be divisible by (b-1) in multiple cases.

Wait, perhaps b-1 being a factorial number would help, since factorial numbers have many small factors.

Let me try b-1=24, which is 4!, but that didn't help as we saw earlier.

Wait, perhaps b-1=60, which is 5*4*3.

Let me compute for b=61.

s_min=ceiling(sqrt(61))=8.

s_max=60.

We need s(s-1) divisible by 60.

60=4*3*5.

So, s(s-1) must be divisible by 4,3,5.

Which implies, s or s-1 must be divisible by 4, s or s-1 divisible by 3, and s or s-1 divisible by 5.

So, we can find s where:

Either s ≡0 mod4 and s ≡0 mod3 and s≡0 mod5,

Or s ≡1 mod4 and s ≡0 mod3 and s≡0 mod5,

Or similar combinations.

But perhaps it's easier to list s in 8 to 60 where s(s-1) is divisible by 60.

But this might take a while.

Alternatively, perhaps I can think of s such that s or s-1 is divisible by 5, s or s-1 divisible by 3, and s or s-1 divisible by 4.

So, s can be:

- s ≡0 mod5, and s ≡0 mod3, and s ≡0 mod4. So s ≡0 mod lcm(5,3,4)=60. So s=60.

- s ≡1 mod5, and s ≡0 mod3, and s ≡0 mod4. So s ≡1 mod5, and s ≡0 mod12. Let's find s= x where x ≡0 mod12 and x≡1 mod5.

Find x such that x ≡1 mod5 and x ≡0 mod12.

Solutions: x ≡ 12 mod60? Wait, no. Let's compute:

Numbers divisible by 12: 12,24,36,48,60,...

Check which are 1 mod5:

12 mod5=2. No.

24 mod5=4. No.

36 mod5=1. Yes. So s=36.

Next would be 36 +60=96, which is beyond s_max=60.

- s ≡0 mod5, and s ≡1 mod3, and s ≡0 mod4.

So s ≡0 mod5, s ≡1 mod3, s≡0 mod4.

Find s ≡0 mod20 (since 4 and5 are coprime, lcm=20), and s ≡1 mod3.

Numbers divisible by 20: 20,40,60.

20 mod3=2. No.

40 mod3=1. Yes. So s=40.

60 mod3=0. No.

- s ≡1 mod5, s≡1 mod3, s≡0 mod4.

So s ≡1 mod5, s≡1 mod3, s≡0 mod4.

Find s ≡1 mod15 (since 3 and5 are coprime), and s≡0 mod4.

Numbers congruent to 1 mod15:1,16,31,46,61,...

Check which are 0 mod4:

16 mod4=0. So s=16.

Next would be 16+60=76>60.

- s ≡0 mod5, s≡2 mod3, s≡0 mod4.

Wait, this is getting too complicated. Maybe it's better to list s where s(s-1) is divisible by 60.

But for s from 8 to60.

Let me think of s where s is 0 mod5:

s=10,15,20,25,30,35,40,45,50,55,60.

For each, check if s(s-1) divisible by 60.

Wait, s=10:

10*9=90. 90/60=1.5. No.

s=15:

15*14=210. 210/60=3.5. No.

s=20:

20*19=380. 380/60≈6.333. No.

s=25:

25*24=600. 600/60=10. Yes.

s=30:

30*29=870. 870/60=14.5. No.

s=35:

35*34=1190. 1190/60≈19.833. No.

s=40:

40*39=1560. 1560/60=26. Yes.

s=45:

45*44=1980. 1980/60=33. Yes.

s=50:

50*49=2450. 2450/60≈40.833. No.

s=55:

55*54=2970. 2970/60=49.5. No.

s=60:

60*59=3540. 3540/60=59. Yes.

So, s=25,40,45,60.

Now, check s=1 mod5:

s=11,16,21,26,31,36,41,46,51,56.

For each, check s(s-1):

s=11:11*10=110. 110/60≈1.833. No.

s=16:16*15=240. 240/60=4. Yes.

s=21:21*20=420. 420/60=7. Yes.

s=26:26*25=650. 650/60≈10.833. No.

s=31:31*30=930. 930/60=15.5. No.

s=36:36*35=1260. 1260/60=21. Yes.

s=41:41*40=1640. 1640/60≈27.333. No.

s=46:46*45=2070. 2070/60=34.5. No.

s=51:51*50=2550. 2550/60=42.5. No.

s=56:56*55=3080. 3080/60≈51.333. No.

So, s=16,21,36.

Now, check s=2 mod5:

s=7,12,17,22,27,32,37,42,47,52,57.

But s starts at 8, so s=12,17,22,27,32,37,42,47,52,57.

Check s(s-1):

s=12:12*11=132. 132/60=2.2. No.

s=17:17*16=272. 272/60≈4.533. No.

s=22:22*21=462. 462/60=7.7. No.

s=27:27*26=702. 702/60=11.7. No.

s=32:32*31=992. 992/60≈16.533. No.

s=37:37*36=1332. 1332/60=22.2. No.

s=42:42*41=1722. 1722/60=28.7. No.

s=47:47*46=2162. 2162/60≈36.033. No.

s=52:52*51=2652. 2652/60=44.2. No.

s=57:57*56=3192. 3192/60=53.2. No.

So, no s in this category.

s=3 mod5:

s=3,8,13,18,23,28,33,38,43,48,53,58.

But s starts at 8, so s=8,13,18,23,28,33,38,43,48,53,58.

Check s(s-1):

s=8:8*7=56. 56/60<1. No.

s=13:13*12=156. 156/60=2.6. No.

s=18:18*17=306. 306/60=5.1. No.

s=23:23*22=506. 506/60≈8.433. No.

s=28:28*27=756. 756/60=12.6. No.

s=33:33*32=1056. 1056/60=17.6. No.

s=38:38*37=1406. 1406/60≈23.433. No.

s=43:43*42=1806. 1806/60=30.1. No.

s=48:48*47=2256. 2256/60=37.6. No.

s=53:53*52=2756. 2756/60≈45.933. No.

s=58:58*57=3306. 3306/60=55.1. No.

So, no s in this category.

So, for b=61, s=25,40,45,60,16,21,36.

Total of 7 s's.

Wait, let's count them:

From s=0 mod5:25,40,45,60 (4 s's).

From s=1 mod5:16,21,36 (3 s's).

Total of 7 s's.

But s must be >=8. So all these s's are valid.

Now, for each of these s's, compute a and c:

s=25:

a=(25^2 -25)/(61-1)= (625 -25)/60=600/60=10.

a=10 <=60.

c=25 -10=15 <=60.

So, valid. n=625 is 10 15 in base61: 10*61 +15=625.

s=40:

a=(1600 -40)/60=1560/60=26.

a=26 <=60.

c=40 -26=14 <=60.

n=1600 is 26 14 in base61: 26*61 +14=1600.

s=45:

a=(2025 -45)/60=1980/60=33.

a=33 <=60.

c=45 -33=12 <=60.

n=2025 is 33 12 in base61: 33*61 +12=2025.

s=60:

a=(3600 -60)/60=3540/60=59.

a=59 <=60.

c=60 -59=1 <=60.

n=3600 is 59 1 in base61:59*61 +1=3600.

s=16:

a=(256 -16)/60=240/60=4.

a=4 <=60.

c=16 -4=12 <=60.

n=256 is 4 12 in base61:4*61 +12=256.

s=21:

a=(441 -21)/60=420/60=7.

a=7 <=60.

c=21 -7=14 <=60.

n=441 is7 14 in base61:7*61 +14=441.

s=36:

a=(1296 -36)/60=1260/60=21.

a=21 <=60.

c=36 -21=15 <=60.

n=1296 is21 15 in base61:21*61 +15=1296.

So, total count=7.

Wait, so for b=61, there are seven b-eautiful numbers. Still less than ten.

I need a base where the count is more than ten. So perhaps larger b's.

Wait, perhaps for b=121, which is 11^2, but that might be too big.

Alternatively, perhaps I should look for b where (b-1) is a multiple of many small numbers, which would allow for more s's.

Alternatively, maybe I should take (b-1)=240, which is 16*15, which has many factors.

But this is getting too time-consuming.

Alternatively, perhaps the minimal b is 121. Let me check.

Wait, if b=121, then (b-1)=120, which has many factors.

So, s must satisfy s(s-1) divisible by 120.

120=8*3*5.

So, s or s-1 must be divisible by 8, 3, and5.

So, s can be:

- s ≡0 mod8, s≡0 mod3, s≡0 mod5.

Or,

- s ≡1 mod8, s≡0 mod3, s≡0 mod5.

And so on.

But I think I need a better approach.

Alternatively, perhaps the number of solutions for a given b is equal to the number of divisors of (b-1) that are less than or equal to s_max.

Wait, perhaps the number of solutions is equal to the number of ways to write (b-1) as a product of two consecutive integers.

But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the number of solutions is equal to the number of s where s or s-1 is a multiple of (b-1)'s factors.

But I'm stuck.

Wait, perhaps the number of s's is equal to the number of divisors of (b-1) that are less than s_max.

But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps for each divisor d of (b-1), we can set s=d or s=d+1, and count how many such s are in the range [s_min, s_max].

So, for example, for (b-1)=24, the divisors are 1,2,3,4,6,8,12,24.

So, s can be 2,3,4,5,7,9,13,25.

But s must be >=4, so s=4,5,7,9,13,25.

Wait, but earlier for b=25, s=9,16,24, etc. Hmm, perhaps this approach is not accurate.

Wait, perhaps the number of s's is equal to the number of ways to write (b-1) as a product of two consecutive integers, plus the number of ways to write (b-1) as a product of two consecutive integers in reverse.

But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the number of s's is equal to the number of pairs (d, d+1) such that d*(d+1) is a multiple of (b-1).

But again, not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps for each divisor d of (b-1), set s=d or s=d+1, and see if s is in the range.

So, for (b-1)=12, divisors are 1,2,3,4,6,12.

So, s can be 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,13.

But s must be >=4, so s=4,5,6,7,13.

But for b=13, earlier count was 3.

So this approach may not directly give the count.

Alternatively, perhaps the number of solutions is equal to the number of divisors of (b-1) that are <= s_max.

But for b=13, (b-1)=12, which has 6 divisors. So, 6 possible s's, but earlier count was 3.

So, perhaps each divisor contributes half a solution, but not sure.

At this point, I think I need to find a more systematic way to compute the count for each b until I find one where the count exceeds ten.

Given that for b=61, count was 7, perhaps for larger b, the count increases.

Let me try b=121:

(b-1)=120.

s_min=ceiling(sqrt(121))=11.

s_max=120.

We need s(s-1) divisible by 120.

120=8*3*5.

So, s or s-1 must be divisible by 8, 3, and5.

So, s can be:

- s ≡0 mod8, s≡0 mod3, s≡0 mod5.

Which is s ≡0 mod120.

So, s=120.

- s ≡1 mod8, s≡0 mod3, s≡0 mod5.

So, s ≡1 mod8, s≡0 mod15.

Find s=16 mod40? Wait, let's solve:

s ≡0 mod15,

s ≡1 mod8.

Find s:

60 mod8=4. No.

75 mod8=3. No.

90 mod8=2. No.

105 mod8=1. Yes.

120 mod8=0. No.

So, s=105.

- s ≡0 mod8, s≡1 mod3, s≡0 mod5.

So, s ≡0 mod40 (since 8 and5 are coprime),

s ≡1 mod3.

Numbers divisible by40:40,80,120.

40 mod3=1. Yes.

80 mod3=2. No.

120 mod3=0. No.

So, s=40.

- s ≡1 mod8, s≡1 mod3, s≡0 mod5.

So, s ≡1 mod8,

s ≡1 mod3,

s ≡0 mod5.

Find s:

s ≡1 mod24 (since 8 and3 are coprime),

and s ≡0 mod5.

Find s ≡1 mod24 and s≡0 mod5.

Numbers congruent to1 mod24:1,25,49,73,97,121,...

Which are 0 mod5:

25 mod5=0. So s=25.

Next would be 25 + 120=145>120.

- s ≡0 mod8, s≡2 mod3, s≡0 mod5.

s ≡0 mod40,

s ≡2 mod3.

40 mod3=1. So 40 +2=42 mod3=0. Not helpful.

Wait, find s divisible by40, and s≡2 mod3.

Numbers:40,80,120.

40 mod3=1. 40 +2=42≡0. Not 2.

80 mod3=2. So s=80.

120 mod3=0. Not 2.

So, s=80.

- s ≡1 mod8, s≡2 mod3, s≡0 mod5.

s≡1 mod8,

s≡2 mod3,

s≡0 mod5.

Find s:

s ≡1 mod8,

s ≡2 mod3,

s≡0 mod5.

Let me solve:

s ≡0 mod5 => s=5k.

Also, s ≡2 mod3 =>5k≡2 mod3 => 5k≡2 mod3 => 2k≡2 mod3 =>k≡1 mod3. So k=3m +1.

So s=5*(3m +1)=15m +5.

Also, s ≡1 mod8.

So 15m +5 ≡1 mod8 =>15m ≡-4 mod8 =>15m≡4 mod8.

15 mod8=7, so 7m ≡4 mod8.

Multiply both sides by inverse of7 mod8. 7*7=49≡1 mod8, so inverse is7.

So m ≡4*7=28≡4 mod8.

So m=8n +4.

Thus, s=15*(8n +4) +5=120n +65.

Within s_max=120, n=0: s=65.

n=1: s=185>120.

So, s=65.

- s ≡0 mod8, s≡0 mod3, s≡1 mod5.

s ≡0 mod24,

s≡1 mod5.

s=24k.

24k ≡1 mod5 =>24k≡1 mod5 =>4k≡1 mod5 =>k≡4^{-1} mod5.

Since 4*4=16≡1 mod5, so inverse is4.

Thus, k≡4 mod5.

So, k=5m +4.

s=24*(5m +4)=120m +96.

Within s_max=120, m=0: s=96.

m=1: s=216>120.

So, s=96.

- s ≡1 mod8, s≡0 mod3, s≡1 mod5.

s≡1 mod8,

s≡0 mod3,

s≡1 mod5.

Find s:

s ≡1 mod8,

s≡0 mod3,

s≡1 mod5.

Use Chinese Remainder Theorem.

Let me solve step by step.

First, solve s ≡1 mod8 and s≡1 mod5.

Find s ≡1 mod lcm(8,5)=40.

So s=40k +1.

Now, s must be ≡0 mod3.

40k +1 ≡0 mod3 =>40k ≡-1 mod3 =>(40 mod3=1) =>k ≡-1 mod3 =>k≡2 mod3.

So, k=3m +2.

Thus, s=40*(3m +2) +1=120m +81.

Within s_max=120, m=0: s=81.

m=1: s=201>120.

So, s=81.

- s ≡0 mod8, s≡1 mod3, s≡1 mod5.

s ≡0 mod8,

s≡1 mod3,

s≡1 mod5.

Find s:

s ≡0 mod8,

s≡1 mod15 (since 3 and5 are coprime).

Find s ≡1 mod15 and s≡0 mod8.

Numbers ≡1 mod15:1,16,31,46,61,76,91,106,121,...

Check which are 0 mod8:

16 mod8=0. So s=16.

Next would be 16 +120=136>120.

So, s=16.

- s ≡1 mod8, s≡2 mod3, s≡1 mod5.

s ≡1 mod8,

s≡2 mod3,

s≡1 mod5.

Find s:

s ≡1 mod8,

s≡2 mod3,

s≡1 mod5.

Use Chinese Remainder Theorem.

First, solve s ≡1 mod8 and s≡1 mod5.

As before, s=40k +1.

Now, 40k +1 ≡2 mod3 =>40k ≡1 mod3 =>1k ≡1 mod3 =>k≡1 mod3.

So, k=3m +1.

Thus, s=40*(3m +1) +1=120m +41.

Within s_max=120, m=0: s=41.

m=1: s=161>120.

So, s=41.

- s ≡0 mod8, s≡2 mod3, s≡1 mod5.

s ≡0 mod8,

s≡2 mod3,

s≡1 mod5.

Find s:

s ≡0 mod8,

s≡2 mod15 (since 3 and5 are coprime).

Find s ≡2 mod15 and s≡0 mod8.

Numbers ≡2 mod15:2,17,32,47,62,77,92,107,122,...

Check which are 0 mod8:

32 mod8=0. So s=32.

Next would be 32 +120=152>120.

So, s=32.

- s ≡1 mod8, s≡0 mod3, s≡2 mod5.

s ≡1 mod8,

s≡0 mod3,

s≡2 mod5.

Find s:

s ≡1 mod8,

s≡0 mod3,

s≡2 mod5.

Use Chinese Remainder Theorem.

First, solve s ≡1 mod8 and s≡2 mod5.

s ≡1 mod8 =>s=8k +1.

8k +1 ≡2 mod5 =>8k ≡1 mod5 =>3k ≡1 mod5 =>k≡2 mod5.

So, k=5m +2.

Thus, s=8*(5m +2) +1=40m +17.

Now, s must be ≡0 mod3.

40m +17 ≡(40 mod3=1)m + (17 mod3=2) =>m +2 ≡0 mod3 =>m≡1 mod3.

So, m=3n +1.

Thus, s=40*(3n +1) +17=120n +57.

Within s_max=120, n=0: s=57.

n=1: s=177>120.

So, s=57.

- s ≡0 mod8, s≡1 mod3, s≡2 mod5.

s ≡0 mod8,

s≡1 mod3,

s≡2 mod5.

Find s:

s ≡0 mod8,

s≡1 mod3,

s≡2 mod5.

Use Chinese Remainder Theorem.

s ≡0 mod8,

s ≡1 mod3,

s ≡2 mod5.

First, solve s ≡0 mod8 and s ≡2 mod5.

s=8k.

8k ≡2 mod5 =>3k ≡2 mod5 =>k ≡4 mod5.

So, k=5m +4.

Thus, s=8*(5m +4)=40m +32.

Now, s must be ≡1 mod3.

40m +32 ≡(40 mod3=1)m + (32 mod3=2) =>m +2 ≡1 mod3 =>m ≡-1 ≡2 mod3.

So, m=3n +2.

Thus, s=40*(3n +2) +32=120n +112.

Within s_max=120, n=0: s=112.

n=1: s=232>120.

So, s=112.

So, compiling all s's:

From previous steps, we have s=120,105,40,25,80,65,96,81,16,41,32,57,112.

Wait, let's count them:

1. 120
2. 105
3. 40
4. 25
5.80
6.65
7.96
8.81
9.16
10.41
11.32
12.57
13.112

So, total of13 s's.

But s must be >=11.

So, all these s's are valid.

Now, compute a and c for each s:

s=120:

a=(120^2 -120)/120= (14400 -120)/120=14280/120=119.

c=120 -119=1.

So, valid. n=14400 is 119 1 in base121.

s=105:

a=(105^2 -105)/120= (11025 -105)/120=10920/120=91.

c=105 -91=14.

Valid. n=11025 is 91 14 in base121.

s=40:

a=(1600 -40)/120=1560/120=13.

c=40 -13=27.

Valid. n=1600 is13 27 in base121.

s=25:

a=(625 -25)/120=600/120=5.

c=25 -5=20.

Valid. n=625 is5 20 in base121.

s=80:

a=(6400 -80)/120=6320/120≈52.666. Wait, no, 6320 divided by 120:

120*52=6240.

6320 -6240=80.

So, 52 + 80/120=52 + 2/3. Not integer. Wait, something's wrong.

Wait, 80^2=6400.

a=(6400 -80)/120=6320/120.

Divide 6320 by120:

120*52=6240.

6320-6240=80.

So, 52 and 80/120=52 and 2/3. Not integer.

Hmm, this is a problem. Did I make a mistake?

Wait, earlier steps: s=80 was obtained from the case where s≡0 mod8, s≡2 mod3, s≡0 mod5.

But when computing a, it's giving a non-integer. So, perhaps s=80 is not a solution? But I thought s(s-1)=80*79=6320, which is 6320/120=52.666, which is not integer. So, s=80 is invalid.

Wait, that's a contradiction. Did I make a mistake in the earlier steps?

Wait, s=80: s(s-1)=80*79=6320.

6320 divided by120 is 52.666..., which is not integer. So, s=80 is not a solution.

So, perhaps my approach to list s's is flawed.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in solving the congruences.

Earlier, for s≡0 mod8, s≡2 mod3, s≡0 mod5.

Which would be s ≡0 mod lcm(8,5)=40,

and s≡2 mod3.

So, s=40k,

40k ≡2 mod3,

40 mod3=1, so k≡2 mod3.

Thus, k=3m +2,

s=40*(3m +2)=120m +80.

So, s=80,200,...

But s=80: s(s-1)=80*79=6320,

6320 /120=52.666..., which is not integer. So, s=80 is invalid.

So, perhaps my earlier approach is wrong.

Wait, perhaps I need to ensure that s(s-1) is divisible by (b-1). So, for s=80, 80*79=6320, which is not divisible by120, thus s=80 is invalid.

So, my mistake was assuming that solving the congruences would automatically give s where s(s-1) is divisible by120, but in reality, s must satisfy s(s-1) divisible by120, which is a different condition.

Therefore, my earlier approach is incorrect. I need a better way.

Perhaps, instead of listing s's based on congruences, I should iterate through s from s_min to s_max and check if (s^2 -s) is divisible by (b-1).

But this is time-consuming.

Alternatively, perhaps for each b, the number of s's is equal to the number of divisors of (b-1) that are less than or equal to s_max, but I'm not sure.

Wait, for b=121, (b-1)=120.

The number of divisors of120 is 16 (since 120=2^3*3*5, so (3+1)(1+1)(1+1)=4*2*2=16).

But s can be from11 to120.

So, for each divisor d of120, s can be d or d+1, but s must be >=11 and <=120.

So, list of divisors of120:

1,2,3,4,5,6,8,10,12,15,20,24,30,40,60,120.

So, possible s's:

d=1: s=1 or2.

But s >=11, so discard.

d=2: s=2 or3.

Discard.

d=3: s=3 or4.

Discard.

d=4: s=4 or5.

Discard.

d=5: s=5 or6.

Discard.

d=6: s=6 or7.

Discard.

d=8: s=8 or9.

Discard.

d=10: s=10 or11.

s=11 is acceptable.

d=12: s=12 or13.

s=12,13 are acceptable.

d=15: s=15 or16.

s=15,16.

d=20: s=20 or21.

d=24: s=24 or25.

d=30: s=30 or31.

d=40: s=40 or41.

d=60: s=60 or61.

d=120: s=120 or121. But s_max=120, so s=120.

So, possible s's:

11,12,13,15,16,20,21,24,25,30,31,40,41,60,61,120.

Now, check which of these s's satisfy s(s-1) divisible by120.

Compute s(s-1) for each:

s=11:11*10=110. 110/120=0.916... No.

s=12:12*11=132. 132/120=1.1. No.

s=13:13*12=156. 156/120=1.3. No.

s=15:15*14=210. 210/120=1.75. No.

s=16:16*15=240. 240/120=2. Yes.

s=20:20*19=380. 380/120≈3.166. No.

s=21:21*20=420. 420/120=3.5. No.

s=24:24*23=552. 552/120=4.6. No.

s=25:25*24=600. 600/120=5. Yes.

s=30:30*29=870. 870/120=7.25. No.

s=31:31*30=930. 930/120=7.75. No.

s=40:40*39=1560. 1560/120=13. Yes.

s=41:41*40=1640. 1640/120≈13.666. No.

s=60:60*59=3540. 3540/120=29.5. No.

s=61:61*60=3660. 3660/120=30.5. No.

s=120:120*119=14280. 14280/120=119. Yes.

So, valid s's are 16,25,40,120.

So, four s's.

Therefore, for b=121, count=4.

Hmm, still less than ten.

I think I need a different approach.

Wait, perhaps for each b, the number of solutions is equal to the number of pairs (d, e) where d*e=(b-1), and d and e are consecutive integers.

Wait, because s(s-1) must be divisible by (b-1), which can be written as s(s-1) = k*(b-1), where k is integer.

But s and s-1 are coprime, so (b-1) must be a product of two coprime numbers, one dividing s and the other dividing s-1.

So, (b-1) can be factored into two coprime factors, d and e, such that d divides s and e divides s-1, or vice versa.

Therefore, the number of solutions is equal to the number of ways to factor (b-1) into two coprime factors d and e, multiplied by the number of solutions to s ≡0 mod d and s ≡1 mod e, or s ≡1 mod d and s ≡0 mod e.

But this is getting too complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps the number of solutions is equal to the number of ways to write (b-1) as d*e where d and e are coprime, and then solve for s.

But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps I should accept that this problem is complex and the minimal b is 121, but since for b=121, count=4, which is still less than ten, I need to go higher.

Alternatively, perhaps the minimal b is 241, which is (b-1)=240.

But this is getting too time-consuming.

Alternatively, perhaps the minimal b is 121, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the minimal b is 121, but as I saw, count=4, which is still less than ten.

Wait, perhaps I should try b=21, which is (b-1)=20.

s_min=ceiling(sqrt(21))=5.

s_max=20.

So, s ranges from5 to20.

Compute s(s-1) divisible by20.

20=4*5.

So, s or s-1 must be divisible by4 and5.

So, s can be:

- s ≡0 mod4 and s≡0 mod5: s≡0 mod20.

So, s=20.

- s≡1 mod4 and s≡0 mod5: s≡1 mod4 and s≡0 mod5.

Find s=5, 15,25,... But s <=20.

s=5:5 mod4=1. So s=5.

s=15:15 mod4=3. No.

- s≡0 mod4 and s≡1 mod5: s≡0 mod4 and s≡1 mod5.

Find s= 16 mod20.

s=16.

- s≡1 mod4 and s≡1 mod5: s≡1 mod20.

s=1, but s >=5, so s=21>20. No.

So, s=5,16,20.

Now, compute a and c:

s=5:

a=(25 -5)/20=20/20=1.

c=5 -1=4.

Valid. n=25 is14_21 (1*21 +4=25).

s=16:

a=(256 -16)/20=240/20=12.

c=16 -12=4.

Valid. n=256 is12 4 in base21:12*21 +4=256.

s=20:

a=(400 -20)/20=380/20=19.

c=20 -19=1.

Valid. n=400 is19 1 in base21:19*21 +1=400.

So, count=3.

Hmm, same as before.

Wait, perhaps I need to find a b where (b-1) is a factorial number, like 120, but as before, count was 4.

Wait, perhaps the minimal b is 241, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating and the minimal b is 121.

But earlier, for b=121, count was4.

Wait, perhaps I should try b=241.

(b-1)=240.

s_min=ceiling(sqrt(241))=16.

s_max=240.

We need s(s-1) divisible by240.

240=16*15=16*3*5.

So, s or s-1 must be divisible by16, and s or s-1 must be divisible by3 and5.

So, s can be:

- s ≡0 mod16, s≡0 mod15.

Which is s≡0 mod240. So s=240.

- s≡1 mod16, s≡0 mod15.

Find s≡1 mod16 and s≡0 mod15.

So, s=81.

s=16k,

16k≡7 mod15 =>k≡7 mod15.

k=15m +7.

s=16*(15m +7Okay, so I have this problem here about b-eautiful numbers. Let me try to understand what it's asking. 

So, a positive integer n is called b-eautiful if two conditions are met: first, when n is written in base b, it has exactly two digits. Second, the sum of those two digits equals the square root of n. The example given is 81, which is 13-eautiful because in base 13, it's written as 63, and 6+3=9, which is sqrt(81). 

The task is to find the least integer b (where b is at least 2) such that there are more than ten b-eautiful numbers. Hmm, okay. So I need to figure out for each base b starting from 2 upwards, how many numbers n satisfy the given conditions, and find the smallest b where this count exceeds ten.

Let me break down the problem. 

First, n has exactly two digits in base b. That means n can be written as a two-digit number in base b, which translates to n = a * b + c, where a and c are the digits. But in any base, the digits must satisfy 0 ≤ a, c < b. Since it's a two-digit number, the first digit a can't be zero, so a is from 1 to b-1, and c is from 0 to b-1.

Second, the sum of the digits a + c must equal sqrt(n). So, putting it all together, we have:

n = a * b + c

and

a + c = sqrt(n).

So, substituting sqrt(n) into the first equation, we get:

n = a * b + c

But since a + c = sqrt(n), let's let s = a + c. Then, s = sqrt(n), so n = s^2.

Substituting back into the first equation:

s^2 = a * b + c.

But since c = s - a, because a + c = s, we can substitute that in:

s^2 = a * b + (s - a)

Simplify this:

s^2 = a*b + s - a

Let me rearrange terms:

s^2 - s = a*(b - 1)

So, s^2 - s must be equal to a*(b - 1). 

Now, since a is a digit in base b, a can be from 1 to b-1. So, a must be a positive integer less than b.

Also, s = a + c, and since c is a digit (0 to b-1), s must be at most a + (b-1). Since a is at most b-1, s can be as high as (b-1) + (b-1) = 2b - 2. But s is sqrt(n), which is sqrt(a*b + c). Since a*b is the main term, s is roughly sqrt(a*b). So, s is going to be somewhere between... let's think. The smallest n is 10_b which is b in decimal, so s = sqrt(b). The largest n is (b-1)(b) + (b-1) = b(b-1) + (b-1) = (b-1)(b + 1) = b^2 -1, so s = sqrt(b^2 - 1) ≈ b.

So, s is between roughly sqrt(b) and b. 

But perhaps more importantly, s must be an integer because it's the sum of two integers a and c, and it's equal to sqrt(n), which is sqrt(s^2) = s. So s must be an integer.

So, s is an integer, and n = s^2. 

So, let's recap:

We have s^2 = a*b + c, and c = s - a. So substituting, we get:

s^2 = a*b + (s - a)

Which simplifies to:

s^2 - s = a*(b - 1)

So, s^2 - s must be divisible by (b - 1), and a must be s^2 - s divided by (b - 1). But a must be an integer between 1 and b-1.

So, for each base b, we can look for integers s where s^2 - s is divisible by (b - 1), and when we compute a = (s^2 - s)/(b - 1), a must be an integer in [1, b-1]. 

Also, since c = s - a, c must also satisfy 0 ≤ c < b. So, c = s - a must be >=0 and <b.

So, putting it all together, for each b, we can iterate over possible s values and see if a computed as (s^2 -s)/(b-1) is an integer between 1 and b-1, and c = s - a is between 0 and b-1.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to fix s and see for which b's it's valid.

Wait, but I'm trying to find for each b, how many s's satisfy the conditions, and then find the smallest b where the number of such s's is greater than 10.

So, maybe for each b, I can compute the number of valid s's, and then find the minimal b where that count is >10.

Alternatively, maybe it's better to model this as for each s, find all possible b's where (s^2 - s) is divisible by (b -1), and a = (s^2 -s)/(b -1) is between 1 and b-1, and c = s - a is between 0 and b-1.

But that might be complicated. Perhaps it's better to think in terms of s.

Wait, but s is an integer, and n = s^2 is the number, which is two digits in base b, so n >= b (since two-digit numbers in base b start from 10_b which is b in decimal) and n <= b*(b-1) + (b-1) = b^2 -1.

So, s^2 must satisfy b <= s^2 <= b^2 -1.

Taking square roots, sqrt(b) <= s <= sqrt(b^2 -1) ≈ b.

So, s ranges from roughly sqrt(b) up to b.

But s must be an integer, so s is from ceil(sqrt(b)) up to b.

Wait, but for a given b, s can be from floor(sqrt(b)) +1 up to b.

Wait, let me think again. For n to be a two-digit number in base b, n must be at least b (10_b) and at most b^2 -1.

So, n = s^2 must satisfy b <= s^2 <= b^2 -1.

So, s must satisfy sqrt(b) <= s <= sqrt(b^2 -1). Which is approximately s >= sqrt(b) and s <= b.

But since s is an integer, the minimum s is ceil(sqrt(b)), and the maximum s is b.

Wait, because s can be up to b, since s^2 = n <= b^2 -1, so s can be up to b-1? Wait, because if s = b, then s^2 = b^2, but n is at most b^2 -1, so s can be at most b-1.

Wait, that's a correction. So s must satisfy sqrt(b) <= s <= b -1.

Because n = s^2 must be less than or equal to b^2 -1, so s can't be equal to b.

So, s ranges from ceil(sqrt(b)) up to b-1.

Hmm. So for each b, s can be in [ceil(sqrt(b)), b-1].

But s must be an integer, so s can be from m to b-1, where m is the smallest integer greater than or equal to sqrt(b).

So, for each b, the number of possible s's is (b-1 - m +1) = b - m.

But not all s's will satisfy the condition that (s^2 - s) is divisible by (b -1), and that a is in [1, b-1].

So, for each b, we can iterate through s from m to b-1, compute (s^2 - s) and see if it's divisible by (b-1). If it is, then compute a = (s^2 - s)/(b-1). Then, check whether a is in [1, b-1], and whether c = s - a is in [0, b-1].

If all these conditions are satisfied, then n = s^2 is a b-eautiful number.

So, the problem is to find the minimal b where the number of such s's is more than ten.

Hmm, okay. So perhaps I can write an equation for a in terms of s and b.

We have a = (s^2 - s)/(b -1).

But a must be an integer between 1 and b-1.

So, for a given b, the possible s's must satisfy that (s^2 - s) is divisible by (b -1), and a must be in [1, b-1], and c = s - a must be in [0, b-1].

Alternatively, perhaps for each b, we can find the number of s such that (s^2 - s) is divisible by (b-1), and a and c satisfy their respective constraints.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to model this as a quadratic in s.

Wait, but maybe let's think about s and b.

Let me consider that for a given s, the possible b's must satisfy (s^2 - s) is divisible by (b-1). So, (b -1) must be a divisor of s(s -1). So, for each s, b -1 can be any divisor of s(s -1), and then b is one more than such a divisor.

But then, we also have to ensure that a = (s^2 - s)/(b -1) is between 1 and b -1.

Wait, that's a bit of a circular argument because b is defined in terms of s.

Alternatively, perhaps for each s, we can find possible b's such that (b -1) divides s(s -1), and then check if a and c are within their digit constraints.

But since we're looking for the minimal b where the count exceeds ten, perhaps it's better to iterate over b starting from 2 upwards, and for each b, count the number of valid s's, and stop when the count exceeds ten.

But doing this manually for each b would be tedious, but maybe I can find a pattern or formula.

Let me first express the equation again:

s^2 = a*b + c

with a + c = s.

So substituting c = s - a into the first equation:

s^2 = a*b + (s - a)

Rearranged as:

s^2 - s = a*(b -1)

So, a = (s^2 - s)/(b -1)

Since a must be an integer, (s^2 - s) must be divisible by (b -1). So, (b -1) must be a factor of s(s -1).

So, for each b, (b -1) must be a divisor of s(s -1). Also, a must satisfy 1 ≤ a ≤ b -1, and c = s -a must satisfy 0 ≤ c ≤ b -1.

So, another way to think about this is that for each b, the number of b-eautiful numbers is equal to the number of pairs (s, a) such that (b -1) divides s(s -1), a = (s^2 - s)/(b -1), and a and c satisfy their constraints.

Alternatively, perhaps I can write this as:

Let d = b -1. Then d must be a divisor of s(s -1). So, for each s, d can be any divisor of s(s-1). Then, b = d +1.

But for each s, how many d's (divisors of s(s-1)) will lead to a valid a and c?

Wait, but perhaps it's better to fix s and find all possible d's, then b = d +1.

But since we need to find b's where the number of such s's is >10, perhaps it's better to iterate over s and find all possible b's for each s, and then count how many times each b occurs, and find the smallest b with count >10.

Wait, but this might be a bit complicated.

Alternatively, maybe we can express d as a divisor of s(s-1), so d | s(s-1). Then, a = s^2 - s / d.

But a must be between 1 and d (since b = d +1, so b -1 = d, so a must be ≤ d).

So, a = (s^2 - s)/d = s(s -1)/d.

But since d divides s(s -1), a is an integer.

Moreover, a must be at least 1 and at most d.

So, 1 ≤ s(s -1)/d ≤ d.

Which implies:

s(s -1)/d ≥ 1 => d ≤ s(s -1)

and

s(s -1)/d ≤ d => s(s -1) ≤ d^2.

So, combining these, we have:

sqrt(s(s -1)) ≤ d ≤ s(s -1)

But since d is a divisor of s(s -1), d must be in the range [1, s(s-1)].

But wait, from the inequalities above, d must also be ≥ sqrt(s(s -1)).

So, d is a divisor of s(s -1) that is at least sqrt(s(s -1)).

Hmm, perhaps this can help limit the possible d's.

But I'm not sure if this approach is making it easier.

Let me consider specific examples to get a better understanding.

Take the example given: 81 is 13-eautiful.

In this case, n =81, which is 63 in base 13. So, a=6, c=3, s=9.

So, s^2 =81, which is equal to a*b +c =6*13 +3=78+3=81.

So, s=9, b=13.

Substituting into the equation:

s^2 - s =9^2 -9 =81-9=72.

b -1=12.

So, 72 must be divisible by 12, which it is. a=72/(13-1)=72/12=6.

Then, c= s -a=9-6=3.

Which is valid because c=3 is less than b=13.

So, that works.

Another example: Let me see.

Suppose b=2.

Then, n must be a two-digit number in base 2, which can only be 10_2 = 2.

So, n=2.

Digits a=1, c=0.

Sum a +c=1, which should equal sqrt(2). But sqrt(2) is about 1.414, which is not integer. So, no b=2 has any b-eautiful numbers.

Similarly, b=3.

Two-digit numbers in base 3: 10_3=3, 11_3=4, 12_3=5, 20_3=6, 21_3=7, 22_3=8.

So n can be 3,4,5,6,7,8.

For each of these n, check if a + c = sqrt(n).

n=3: digits a=1, c=0. Sum=1. sqrt(3)=1.732, not integer.

n=4: a=1, c=1. Sum=2. sqrt(4)=2. So yes, 4 is 3-eautiful.

n=5: a=1, c=2. Sum=3. sqrt(5)=2.236, no.

n=6: a=2, c=0. Sum=2. sqrt(6)=2.449, no.

n=7: a=2, c=1. Sum=3. sqrt(7)=2.645, no.

n=8: a=2, c=2. Sum=4. sqrt(8)=2.828, no.

So, only n=4 is 3-eautiful. So count=1.

Similarly, for b=4.

Two-digit numbers: from 4 to 15.

Check each n:

n=4: digits 10_4. sum=1, sqrt(4)=2. No.

n=5: 11_4. sum=2, sqrt(5)=2.236. No.

n=6: 12_4. sum=3, sqrt(6)=2.449. No.

n=7: 13_4. sum=4, sqrt(7)=2.645. No.

n=8: 20_4. sum=2, sqrt(8)=2.828. No.

n=9: 21_4. sum=3, sqrt(9)=3. Yes. So 9 is 4-eautiful.

n=10: 22_4. sum=4, sqrt(10)=3.162. No.

n=11: 23_4. sum=5, sqrt(11)=3.316. No.

n=12: 30_4. sum=3, sqrt(12)=3.464. No.

n=13: 31_4. sum=4, sqrt(13)=3.605. No.

n=14: 32_4. sum=5, sqrt(14)=3.741. No.

n=15: 33_4. sum=6, sqrt(15)=3.872. No.

So, only n=9 is 4-eautiful. Count=1.

Hmm, so for b=3 and 4, only one number each.

Let me check b=5.

Two-digit numbers in base 5: from 5 to 24.

n=5: 10_5. sum=1. sqrt(5)=2.236. No.

n=6:11_5. sum=2. sqrt(6)=2.449. No.

n=7:12_5. sum=3. sqrt(7)=2.645. No.

n=8:13_5. sum=4. sqrt(8)=2.828. No.

n=9:14_5. sum=5. sqrt(9)=3. So yes, sum=5≠3, no.

Wait, wait, n=9 is 14_5, sum=1+4=5≠3. So no.

n=10:20_5. sum=2. sqrt(10)=3.162. No.

n=11:21_5. sum=3. sqrt(11)=3.316. No.

n=12:22_5. sum=4. sqrt(12)=3.464. No.

n=13:23_5. sum=5. sqrt(13)=3.605. No.

n=14:24_5. sum=6. sqrt(14)=3.741. No.

n=15:30_5. sum=3. sqrt(15)=3.872. No.

n=16:31_5. sum=4. sqrt(16)=4. So, yes, 16 is 5-eautiful.

n=17:32_5. sum=5. sqrt(17)=4.123. No.

n=18:33_5. sum=6. sqrt(18)=4.242. No.

n=19:34_5. sum=7. sqrt(19)=4.358. No.

n=20:35_5. sum=8. sqrt(20)=4.472. No.

n=21:40_5. sum=4. sqrt(21)=4.583. No.

n=22:41_5. sum=5. sqrt(22)=4.690. No.

n=23:42_5. sum=6. sqrt(23)=4.795. No.

n=24:43_5. sum=7. sqrt(24)=4.899. No.

So, only n=16 is 5-eautiful. Count=1.

Hmm, so same as before.

Okay, let's try b=10, perhaps.

n must be a two-digit number in base 10, so from 10 to 99.

For each n, check if a + c = sqrt(n).

But this might take a while. Alternatively, using the earlier equation:

s^2 - s = a*(b-1).

Here, b=10, so b-1=9.

So, s^2 - s must be divisible by 9.

Find s where 10 <= s^2 <= 99, so s can be from 4 to 9 (since 4^2=16, 9^2=81, 10^2=100 which is beyond 99).

So s in 4,5,6,7,8,9.

Compute s^2 -s for each:

s=4: 16-4=12. 12/9=1.333. Not integer. So a not integer.

s=5:25-5=20. 20/9≈2.222. Not integer.

s=6:36-6=30. 30/9=3.333. Not integer.

s=7:49-7=42. 42/9=4.666. No.

s=8:64-8=56. 56/9≈6.222. No.

s=9:81-9=72. 72/9=8. So a=8.

Check c =s -a=9-8=1. c=1, which is <10. So yes, valid.

So n=81 is 10-eautiful? Wait, but in the example, it's 13-eautiful. Wait, but in base 10, 81 is written as 81, so digits a=8, c=1. Sum=9, which is sqrt(81)=9. So yes, 81 is 10-eautiful as well.

Wait, but earlier in the problem statement, it was 13-eautiful. So, it's possible for a number to be b-eautiful in multiple bases.

So, for b=10, we have s=9, a=8, c=1.

So, only one number, 81, is 10-eautiful.

Hmm, so count=1.

Wait, but maybe I missed some s's.

Wait, s=3: n=9. Two-digit in base 10? No, it's a single digit.

s=10: n=100, which is three-digit in base 10, so beyond our consideration.

So, for b=10, only s=9 works.

So, count=1.

Wait, but maybe b=16.

Let me try b=16.

Two-digit numbers in base 16 go from 16 (10_16) to 255 (FF_16).

s must be from 4 (sqrt(16)=4) up to 15 (sqrt(255)≈15.97, so s=15).

So s=4 to 15.

Compute s^2 -s for each and check if divisible by 15 (since b=16, b-1=15).

s=4: 16-4=12. 12/15=0.8. Not integer.

s=5:25-5=20. 20/15≈1.333. No.

s=6:36-6=30. 30/15=2. So a=2. c=6-2=4. c=4 <16. So yes.

Thus, n=36 is 16-eautiful? Wait, n=s^2=36. In base 16, 36 is 24_16. So a=2, c=4. Sum=6, which is sqrt(36)=6. So yes.

s=7:49-7=42. 42/15=2.8. Not integer.

s=8:64-8=56. 56/15≈3.733. No.

s=9:81-9=72. 72/15=4.8. No.

s=10:100-10=90. 90/15=6. So a=6. c=10-6=4. Which is <16. So yes.

n=100. In base 16, 100 is 64_16 (6*16 +4=100). Sum 6+4=10, which is sqrt(100)=10. So yes.

s=11:121-11=110. 110/15≈7.333. No.

s=12:144-12=132. 132/15=8.8. No.

s=13:169-13=156. 156/15=10.4. No.

s=14:196-14=182. 182/15≈12.133. No.

s=15:225-15=210. 210/15=14. So a=14. c=15-14=1. c=1 <16. So yes.

n=225. In base 16, 225 is E1_16 (14*16 +1=225). Sum=14+1=15, sqrt(225)=15. So yes.

So, for b=16, s=6,10,15 are valid. So count=3.

Hmm, so for b=16, count=3.

But we're looking for a b where count>10.

So, perhaps higher bases have more s's.

Wait, let's think about what affects the number of s's.

Each s must satisfy that (s^2 -s) is divisible by (b-1). So, for a given b, the number of s's is equal to the number of divisors of s(s-1) that are equal to (b-1). Wait, no, actually, for each s, (b-1) must be a divisor of s(s-1). So, (b-1) divides s(s-1). So, for a given b, the number of s's is equal to the number of s's where (b-1) divides s(s-1).

But s must be in [ceil(sqrt(b)), b-1].

So, perhaps for a given b-1, the number of s's is equal to the number of s's in [ceil(sqrt(b)), b-1] such that (b-1) divides s(s-1).

Alternatively, since b-1 is fixed, the number of s's is equal to the number of s's in the range where s(s-1) is a multiple of (b-1).

Alternatively, for a given d = b-1, the number of s's is the number of s in [ceil(sqrt(d+1)), d] such that d divides s(s-1).

So, we can model this as: for each d, count the number of s in [ceil(sqrt(d+1)), d] where d | s(s-1).

Then, the count for base b = d +1 is equal to the number of such s's.

Hence, to find the minimal d +1 where the count exceeds 10, we need to find the smallest d where the number of s in [ceil(sqrt(d+1)), d] with d | s(s-1) is >10.

Perhaps it's easier to think in terms of d.

So, for each d, starting from d=1 (b=2), count the number of s's in [ceil(sqrt(d+1)), d] where d | s(s-1).

We need to find the smallest d where this count >10.

But how?

Alternatively, perhaps we can think about the factors of d. Since d divides s(s-1), and s and s-1 are coprime, d must be a product of factors of s and factors of s-1.

But s and s-1 are coprime, so d can be written as d1*d2, where d1 divides s and d2 divides s-1, and d1 and d2 are coprime.

But I'm not sure if that helps.

Alternatively, perhaps for each d, the number of s's in [ceil(sqrt(d+1)), d] where s ≡0 or 1 mod factors of d.

Wait, perhaps another way: since d divides s(s-1), then either d divides s or d divides s-1. But since s and s-1 are coprime, d must divide either s or s-1, but not both unless d=1.

Wait, that might not be correct because d can have factors that divide s and others that divide s-1, even if s and s-1 are coprime.

Wait, for example, d=6. Then s=4: s(s-1)=4*3=12. 6 divides 12. So, 6 divides s(s-1). But 6 doesn't divide s=4, nor does it divide s-1=3. Wait, 6 divides 12, but 6 doesn't divide 3 or 4. So, my earlier thought was incorrect.

So, perhaps the correct approach is that for d to divide s(s-1), the prime factors of d must be distributed between s and s-1.

Since s and s-1 are coprime, the prime factors of d must be entirely in s or entirely in s-1. Wait, no, that's not correct either. Because s and s-1 are coprime, any prime factor of d must divide either s or s-1, but not both. So, for d to divide s(s-1), d must be a product of factors where each prime factor is entirely in s or entirely in s-1.

So, for example, if d has prime factors p1, p2, etc., then for each prime pi, pi must divide either s or s-1, but not both.

So, perhaps for each d, s can be either congruent to 0 mod p, or 1 mod p, for each prime p dividing d.

But since this is getting complicated, perhaps a better approach is to model this as for each d, the number of s's is equal to the number of solutions s in [ceil(sqrt(d+1)), d] such that s ≡0 or 1 mod some factors of d.

But this seems too vague.

Alternatively, perhaps for each d, the number of s's is equal to the number of divisors of d, but this might not be the case.

Wait, perhaps for d, the number of s's is equal to the number of s in [ceil(sqrt(d+1)), d] where s ≡0 or 1 mod k, where k is a divisor of d.

Wait, perhaps not.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to model this as s ≡0 or 1 mod d.

Wait, no. Because for example, d=6.

s=4: 4*3=12. 6 divides 12. So s=4 is a solution.

s=7:7*6=42. 6 divides 42.

s=1:1*0=0. 6 divides 0.

But s must be >= ceil(sqrt(d+1)).

So, for d=6, sqrt(7)=2.645, so s starts from 3.

s=3:3*2=6. 6 divides 6. So s=3 is a solution.

s=4:4*3=12. 6 divides 12: yes.

s=5:5*4=20. 6 doesn't divide 20.

s=6:6*5=30. 6 divides 30: yes.

So, s=3,4,6 are solutions for d=6.

So, count=3.

Hmm, so for d=6, count=3.

Wait, but earlier for d=15 (b=16), we had s=6,10,15, which is count=3 as well.

Wait, but perhaps the number of s's depends on the number of divisors of d.

Wait, for d=6, which has 4 divisors (1,2,3,6), but we have 3 s's.

Wait, maybe the number of s's is equal to the number of pairs (a, d') where d' is a divisor of d, and a is such that s ≡0 mod d' or s ≡1 mod d'.

But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps for each d, the number of s's is equal to the number of divisors of d, but I don't think that's the case, as seen in the example with d=6.

Alternatively, perhaps for each d, the number of s's is equal to the number of divisors t of d where t <= s <=d and s ≡0 or 1 mod t.

But this seems too vague.

Alternatively, perhaps I can think of s(s-1) must be a multiple of d.

So, s(s-1) = k*d, where k is some integer.

But since s and s-1 are coprime, k must be a multiple of both s and s-1, but that's not necessarily the case. Hmm, perhaps this is not helpful.

Alternatively, perhaps for each d, the number of s's is equal to the number of ways to write d as a product of two coprime numbers, say a and b, such that a divides s and b divides s-1.

Since s and s-1 are coprime, if d = a*b where a and b are coprime, then a divides s and b divides s-1, or vice versa.

So, for each divisor pair (a,b) of d with a and b coprime, we can solve for s ≡0 mod a and s ≡1 mod b, or s ≡1 mod a and s ≡0 mod b.

The solutions to these congruences can be found using the Chinese Remainder Theorem (CRT), as a and b are coprime.

Thus, for each such pair (a,b), there is a unique solution modulo a*b =d.

So, for each such pair, we can find s in the range [1, d], and then check if s is within [ceil(sqrt(d+1)), d].

Thus, the number of s's is equal to the number of such pairs (a,b) where a*b =d, a and b are coprime, and the solution s for the congruence is in the required range.

Therefore, the number of solutions s is equal to the number of such coprime divisor pairs (a,b) of d, leading to s in the desired range.

But since this is a bit involved, perhaps it's better to consider that the number of solutions s is equal to 2^{k}, where k is the number of distinct prime factors of d.

Wait, for example, d=6=2*3, which has two distinct prime factors. So, number of coprime pairs (a,b) where a*b=6 is (1,6), (2,3), (3,2), (6,1). But since a and b must be coprime, (2,3) and (3,2) are valid, as 2 and 3 are coprime. Similarly, (1,6) and (6,1), but 1 is coprime with any number.

Wait, so for each d, the number of coprime pairs (a,b) with a*b=d is 2^{m}, where m is the number of distinct prime factors of d.

Wait, perhaps. For d=6, m=2, so 2^2=4. But in reality, we have four pairs: (1,6), (6,1), (2,3), (3,2). But only (2,3) and (3,2) are coprime. So, actually, the number is 2^m, where m is the number of distinct prime factors, but only considering the pairs where a and b are greater than 1.

Wait, this is getting complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps the number of coprime pairs (a,b) with a*b=d is 2^{m}, where m is the number of distinct prime factors of d.

But for d=6, which has two distinct primes, 2 and 3, the number of such pairs is 2^{2}=4, which is correct: (1,6), (6,1), (2,3), (3,2). But only those where a and b are coprime are valid, which are all four, since 1 is coprime with everything, and 2 and 3 are coprime.

Wait, but for each such pair, we can solve for s.

For example, for d=6, the pairs are:

1. a=1, b=6: s ≡0 mod 1 and s ≡1 mod 6. Since s ≡0 mod 1 is always true, s ≡1 mod 6. So s=1,7,13, etc. But s must be <=d=6, so s=1.

2. a=6, b=1: s ≡0 mod 6 and s ≡1 mod 1. s≡0 mod6 and s≡1 mod1 is s≡0 mod6. So s=6.

3. a=2, b=3: s ≡0 mod2 and s≡1 mod3.

Looking for s in [ceil(sqrt(7))=3,6]. Let's see:

s=4: 4 mod2=0, 4 mod3=1. So s=4 is a solution.

s=10: but s=10 >6, so beyond our range.

4. a=3, b=2: s ≡0 mod3 and s≡1 mod2.

Looking for s in [3,6]:

s=3: 3 mod3=0, 3 mod2=1. So yes.

s=9: beyond range.

So, for d=6, the solutions s are 1,3,4,6.

But s must be in [3,6], so s=3,4,6. So, count=3.

Which matches our earlier result.

So, for each d, the number of s's is equal to the number of coprime divisor pairs (a,b) of d, leading to s in the required range.

Thus, the number of solutions s is equal to the number of such pairs where the solution s is within [ceil(sqrt(d+1)), d].

Therefore, to find the minimal d where the count exceeds 10, we need to find the smallest d such that the number of coprime divisor pairs (a,b) with a*b=d, leading to s in [ceil(sqrt(d+1)),d], is greater than 10.

But this seems quite involved. Perhaps we can find a pattern or formula for the number of s's in terms of the number of divisors of d.

Alternatively, perhaps the number of s's for a given d is equal to the number of divisors of d that are <= s_max, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the number of s's is equal to the number of ways to write d as a product of two coprime numbers, which is 2^{k}, where k is the number of distinct prime factors of d.

Wait, for d=6=2*3, which has 2 distinct primes, the number of coprime pairs (a,b) is 4, but in our case, only 3 s's were valid because s=1 was below the minimum s.

Similarly, for d=4=2^2, which has one distinct prime factor, the number of coprime pairs (a,b) would be 2^1=2. Let's check:

d=4.

Possible coprime pairs (a,b) where a*b=4:

(1,4), (4,1), (2,2). But (2,2) are not coprime.

So, valid pairs: (1,4), (4,1).

For each:

1. a=1, b=4: s≡0 mod1 and s≡1 mod4. So s≡1 mod4. Solutions in [2,4] (since sqrt(5)=~2.236, so s>=3). s=3: 3 mod4=3≠1. s=4:4 mod4=0≠1. So no solution in this case.

2. a=4, b=1: s≡0 mod4 and s≡1 mod1. So s≡0 mod4. Solutions in [3,4]: s=4.

So, only s=4 is a solution.

Thus, for d=4, count=1.

So, for d=4, which has one distinct prime factor, the number of coprime pairs (a,b) is 2^1=2, but the number of valid s's is 1.

So, the formula isn't directly 2^k.

But perhaps the number of s's is equal to the number of coprime pairs (a,b) such that the solution s is within the range.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to note that for each divisor a of d (with a<=sqrt(d)), the number of solutions s is given by the number of a's such that a and d/a are coprime, and the solution s falls within the required range.

But this is getting too abstract.

Perhaps it's better to write a program to compute for each d starting from 1, compute the number of s's in [ceil(sqrt(d+1)),d] where d divides s(s-1), and find the minimal d where this count exceeds 10.

But since I'm doing this manually, perhaps I can look for d's with many small factors, as they would likely have more s's.

For example, highly composite numbers.

Let me consider d=12.

d=12.

Compute s in [ceil(sqrt(13))=4,12].

Check for each s=4 to 12 whether 12 divides s(s-1).

s=4:4*3=12. 12 divides 12: yes.

s=5:5*4=20. 12 doesn't divide 20.

s=6:6*5=30. 12 doesn't divide 30 (30/12=2.5).

s=7:7*6=42. 42/12=3.5. No.

s=8:8*7=56. 56/12≈4.666. No.

s=9:9*8=72. 72/12=6. Yes.

s=10:10*9=90. 90/12=7.5. No.

s=11:11*10=110. 110/12≈9.166. No.

s=12:12*11=132. 132/12=11. Yes.

So, s=4,9,12 are solutions. So count=3.

Hmm.

d=24.

s ranges from ceil(sqrt(25))=5 to 24.

Check s=5 to24:

s=5:5*4=20. 24 doesn't divide20.

s=6:6*5=30. 24 doesn't divide30.

s=7:7*6=42. 24 doesn't divide42.

s=8:8*7=56. 24 doesn't divide56.

s=9:9*8=72. 72/24=3. Yes.

s=10:10*9=90. 90/24=3.75. No.

s=11:11*10=110. 110/24≈4.583. No.

s=12:12*11=132. 132/24=5.5. No.

s=13:13*12=156. 156/24=6.5. No.

s=14:14*13=182. 182/24≈7.583. No.

s=15:15*14=210. 210/24=8.75. No.

s=16:16*15=240. 240/24=10. Yes.

s=17:17*16=272. 272/24≈11.333. No.

s=18:18*17=306. 306/24=12.75. No.

s=19:19*18=342. 342/24=14.25. No.

s=20:20*19=380. 380/24≈15.833. No.

s=21:21*20=420. 420/24=17.5. No.

s=22:22*21=462. 462/24=19.25. No.

s=23:23*22=506. 506/24≈21.083. No.

s=24:24*23=552. 552/24=23. Yes.

So, s=9,16,24 are solutions. Count=3.

Hmm, still only 3.

Wait, perhaps I need a d that's a factorial or highly composite.

Let me try d=60.

d=60.

s ranges from ceil(sqrt(61))=8 to 60.

Check s=8 to60:

But this is a lot. Maybe look for s where s(s-1) is divisible by 60.

Factors of 60: 2^2 *3 *5.

So, s and s-1 must cover these factors.

Since s and s-1 are coprime, one must be divisible by 4, another by 3 and 5.

So, either:

Case 1: s ≡0 mod4, s ≡1 mod15 (since 3*5=15)

Or

Case 2: s ≡1 mod4, s ≡0 mod15.

Let's solve for each case.

Case 1: s ≡0 mod4 and s ≡1 mod15.

Using CRT, find s such that:

s ≡0 mod4

s ≡1 mod15

Let’s find the smallest s satisfying both.

Looking for s=15k +1, which is ≡0 mod4.

15k +1 ≡ 3k +1 mod4.

Set 3k +1 ≡0 mod4 => 3k ≡-1 mod4 => 3k ≡3 mod4 => k ≡1 mod4.

So k=4m +1.

Thus, s=15*(4m +1)+1=60m +16.

So, the smallest s in [8,60] is s=16.

Next, s=16, 76 (which is beyond 60).

So, only s=16 in this case.

Case 2: s ≡1 mod4 and s ≡0 mod15.

So,

s ≡1 mod4

s ≡0 mod15

Let’s solve.

s=15k.

15k ≡1 mod4 => 15k ≡3k ≡1 mod4 => 3k ≡1 mod4 => k ≡3 mod4.

So k=4m +3.

Thus, s=15*(4m +3)=60m +45.

So, s=45 is the first solution in [8,60], next would be 105, which is beyond.

Thus, s=45.

So, solutions are s=16 and s=45.

Wait, but earlier when I was computing for d=60, maybe I missed some.

Wait, perhaps there are more solutions.

Wait, another approach: since d=60=4*15, and 4 and15 are coprime, the solutions are s=16 and s=45.

Additionally, perhaps other factor pairs?

d=60 can also be written as 3*20, but 3 and20 are coprime.

Case 3: s ≡0 mod3, s ≡1 mod20.

So,

s=20k +1.

20k +1 ≡(20 mod3)k +1 ≡(2k)+1 ≡0 mod3.

So, 2k +1 ≡0 mod3 => 2k ≡-1 mod3 => 2k ≡2 mod3 => k≡1 mod3.

Thus, k=3m +1.

So, s=20*(3m +1)+1=60m +21.

s=21, 81, etc. s=21 is within [8,60]. Next is 81, which is beyond.

Case 4: s ≡1 mod3, s ≡0 mod20.

s=20k.

20k ≡(20 mod3)k ≡2k ≡1 mod3.

So, 2k ≡1 mod3 => k≡2 mod3.

Thus, k=3m +2.

s=20*(3m +2)=60m +40.

So, s=40, 100, etc. s=40 is within [8,60].

Thus, s=40.

So, now we have additional solutions: s=21 and s=40.

Similarly, d=60 can be written as 5*12, which are coprime.

Case 5: s ≡0 mod5, s ≡1 mod12.

s=12k +1.

12k +1 ≡(12 mod5)k +1≡2k +1≡0 mod5.

So, 2k +1≡0 mod5 => 2k≡-1 mod5 => 2k≡4 mod5 =>k≡2 mod5.

Thus, k=5m +2.

s=12*(5m +2)+1=60m +25.

s=25, 85, etc. s=25 is within [8,60].

Case 6: s ≡1 mod5, s ≡0 mod12.

s=12k.

12k ≡(12 mod5)k≡2k≡1 mod5.

So, 2k≡1 mod5 => k≡3 mod5.

Thus, k=5m +3.

s=12*(5m +3)=60m +36.

s=36, 96, etc. s=36 is within [8,60].

So, s=36.

Thus, now we have s=16,45,21,40,25,36.

Are there more?

d=60 can also be expressed as 6*10, but 6 and10 are not coprime.

But wait, since s and s-1 are coprime, perhaps other factor pairs?

Wait, 60=2^2*3*5.

Other coprime pairs:

(1,60), (3,20), (4,15), (5,12), (6,10) – but 6 and10 are not coprime.

We've already considered (3,20), (4,15), (5,12).

So, perhaps only four coprime pairs: (1,60), (3,20), (4,15), (5,12).

Thus, for each, we found solutions as above.

So, s=16 (from 4,15), s=45 (from 4,15), s=21 (from3,20), s=40 (from3,20), s=25 (from5,12), s=36 (from5,12).

Additionally, from (1,60):

Case 7: a=1, b=60: s≡0 mod1 and s≡1 mod60. So s≡1 mod60. s=1,61,… but s must be >=8, so s=61 is beyond 60.

Case 8: a=60, b=1: s≡0 mod60 and s≡1 mod1. So s≡0 mod60. s=60 is within [8,60].

Thus, s=60.

So, adding s=60.

Similarly, from (6,10), which are not coprime, but perhaps I can still try.

But since 6 and10 are not coprime, their solutions would not be unique in the CRT, but perhaps still valid.

But perhaps it's better to stick to coprime pairs.

So, with the above, the solutions are s=16,45,21,40,25,36,60.

Wait, that's seven solutions.

Wait, did I miss any?

Let me check s=24:

s=24:24*23=552. 552/60=9.2. No, not divisible.

s=12:12*11=132. 132/60=2.2. No.

s=30:30*29=870. 870/60=14.5. No.

So, only the seven s's I found earlier.

Thus, for d=60, count=7.

Still less than 10.

Hmm.

Let me try d=120.

d=120.

s ranges from ceil(sqrt(121))=11 to 120.

Compute s where 120 divides s(s-1).

Factors of 120: 2^3*3*5.

We need s and s-1 to cover these factors, with s and s-1 coprime.

So, possible coprime pairs (a,b) where a*b=120:

(1,120), (3,40), (5,24), (8,15), (10,12).

Wait, but 10 and12 are not coprime, so discard that.

So, coprime pairs: (1,120), (3,40), (5,24), (8,15).

For each pair:

1. a=1, b=120:

s ≡0 mod1 (always true), s≡1 mod120.

Thus, s=1,121,… s=1 is below the minimum s=11. So no solution.

2. a=120, b=1:

s ≡0 mod120, s ≡1 mod1.

Thus, s=120.

3. a=3, b=40:

s ≡0 mod3, s≡1 mod40.

Solve:

s=40k +1.

40k +1 ≡(40 mod3)k +1≡(1)k +1≡k +1≡0 mod3.

Thus, k ≡-1 mod3 => k=3m +2.

So, s=40*(3m +2)+1=120m +81.

s=81 is within [11,120].

4. a=40, b=3:

s ≡0 mod40, s≡1 mod3.

s=40k.

40k ≡(40 mod3)k≡1k≡1 mod3 => k≡1 mod3.

Thus, k=3m +1.

s=40*(3m +1)=120m +40.

s=40,160,… s=40 is within [11,120].

5. a=5, b=24:

s ≡0 mod5, s≡1 mod24.

s=24k +1.

24k +1 ≡(24 mod5)k +1≡4k +1≡0 mod5.

4k +1≡0 mod5 =>4k≡-1 mod5 =>4k≡4 mod5 =>k≡1 mod5.

Thus, k=5m +1.

s=24*(5m +1)+1=120m +25.

s=25,145,… s=25 is within [11,120].

6. a=24, b=5:

s ≡0 mod24, s≡1 mod5.

s=24k.

24k ≡(24 mod5)k≡4k≡1 mod5.

4k≡1 mod5 =>k≡4 mod5.

Thus, k=5m +4.

s=24*(5m +4)=120m +96.

s=96 is within [11,120].

7. a=8, b=15:

s ≡0 mod8, s≡1 mod15.

s=15k +1.

15k +1 ≡(15 mod8)k +1≡7k +1≡0 mod8.

7k +1≡0 mod8 =>7k≡-1 mod8 =>7k≡7 mod8 =>k≡1 mod8.

Thus, k=8m +1.

s=15*(8m +1)+1=120m +16.

s=16,136,… s=16 is within [11,120].

8. a=15, b=8:

s ≡0 mod15, s≡1 mod8.

s=15k.

15k ≡(15 mod8)k≡7k≡1 mod8.

7k≡1 mod8 =>k≡7 mod8.

Thus, k=8m +7.

s=15*(8m +7)=120m +105.

s=105 is within [11,120].

So, solutions from each pair:

From (3,40): s=81

From (40,3): s=40

From (5,24): s=25

From (24,5): s=96

From (8,15): s=16

From (15,8): s=105

From (120,1): s=120

So, s=16,25,40,81,96,105,120.

That's 7 solutions.

Wait, but let's check if there are more:

Wait, perhaps I missed some coprime pairs.

d=120 can be written as (1,120), (3,40), (5,24), (8,15), (10,12), but (10,12) are not coprime.

Wait, also, (2,60): but 2 and60 are not coprime.

So, only the four coprime pairs.

Thus, only seven solutions.

But wait, when s=24:24*23=552. 552/120=4.6. No, not divisible.

Similarly, s=30:30*29=870. 870/120=7.25. No.

So, only seven s's.

Hmm, so count=7.

Still not exceeding 10.

Wait, perhaps d=30.

d=30.

s ranges from ceil(sqrt(31))=6 to30.

Check s=6 to30.

Compute s(s-1) divisible by30.

30=2*3*5.

So, s and s-1 must cover 2,3,5.

Possible coprime pairs (a,b) where a*b=30: (1,30),(2,15),(3,10),(5,6).

But (2,15),(3,10),(5,6) are coprime.

Let's solve for each:

1. a=1, b=30: s≡0 mod1, s≡1 mod30.

s=1,31,… s=1 is below 6. So no.

2. a=30, b=1: s≡0 mod30, s≡1 mod1. So s=30.

3. a=2, b=15: s≡0 mod2, s≡1 mod15.

s=15k +1.

15k +1 ≡(15 mod2)k +1≡1k +1≡0 mod2.

Thus, k +1≡0 mod2 =>k≡1 mod2.

So, k=2m +1.

s=15*(2m +1)+1=30m +16.

s=16,46,… s=16 is within [6,30].

4. a=15, b=2:

s≡0 mod15, s≡1 mod2.

s=15k.

15k ≡(15 mod2)k≡1k≡1 mod2 =>k≡1 mod2.

Thus, k=2m +1.

s=15*(2m +1)=30m +15.

s=15,45,… s=15 is within [6,30].

5. a=3, b=10:

s≡0 mod3, s≡1 mod10.

s=10k +1.

10k +1 ≡(10 mod3)k +1≡1k +1≡0 mod3.

So, k +1≡0 mod3 =>k≡2 mod3.

Thus, k=3m +2.

s=10*(3m +2)+1=30m +21.

s=21,51,… s=21 is within [6,30].

6. a=10, b=3:

s≡0 mod10, s≡1 mod3.

s=10k.

10k ≡(10 mod3)k≡1k≡1 mod3 =>k≡1 mod3.

Thus, k=3m +1.

s=10*(3m +1)=30m +10.

s=10,40,… s=10 is within [6,30].

7. a=5, b=6:

s≡0 mod5, s≡1 mod6.

s=6k +1.

6k +1 ≡(6 mod5)k +1≡1k +1≡0 mod5.

So, k +1≡0 mod5 =>k≡4 mod5.

Thus, k=5m +4.

s=6*(5m +4)+1=30m +25.

s=25,55,… s=25 is within [6,30].

8. a=6, b=5:

s≡0 mod6, s≡1 mod5.

s=6k.

6k ≡(6 mod5)k≡1k≡1 mod5 =>k≡1 mod5.

Thus, k=5m +1.

s=6*(5m +1)=30m +6.

s=6,36,… s=6 is within [6,30].

So, solutions from each pair:

From (2,15): s=16

From (15,2): s=15

From (3,10): s=21

From (10,3): s=10

From (5,6): s=25

From (6,5): s=6

From (30,1): s=30

So, s=6,10,15,16,21,25,30.

That's seven solutions.

Wait, but when s=6:6*5=30. 30/30=1. So yes.

s=10:10*9=90. 90/30=3. Yes.

s=15:15*14=210. 210/30=7. Yes.

s=16:16*15=240. 240/30=8. Yes.

s=21:21*20=420. 420/30=14. Yes.

s=25:25*24=600. 600/30=20. Yes.

s=30:30*29=870. 870/30=29. Yes.

So, count=7.

Still less than 10.

Hmm.

Perhaps trying a larger d.

Let me try d=240.

d=240.

s ranges from ceil(sqrt(241))=16 to240.

Compute s where 240 divides s(s-1).

Factors of 240=16*15=2^4*3*5.

Coprimality pairs (a,b):

(1,240),(3,80),(5,48),(8,30),(10,24),(15,16).

But only coprime pairs: (1,240),(3,80),(5,48),(8,30),(15,16).

Wait, check if (15,16) are coprime: yes, since 15 and16 are consecutive.

So, let's process each pair:

1. a=1, b=240: s≡1 mod240. s=1,241,… s=1 is below 16. So no.

2. a=240, b=1: s≡0 mod240. s=240.

3. a=3, b=80: s≡0 mod3, s≡1 mod80.

s=80k +1.

80k +1 ≡(80 mod3)k +1≡2k +1≡0 mod3.

2k +1≡0 mod3 =>2k≡-1≡2 mod3 =>k≡1 mod3.

Thus, k=3m +1.

s=80*(3m +1)+1=240m +81.

s=81,321,… s=81 is within [16,240].

4. a=80, b=3: s≡0 mod80, s≡1 mod3.

s=80k.

80k ≡(80 mod3)k≡2k≡1 mod3.

2k≡1 mod3 =>k≡2 mod3.

Thus, k=3m +2.

s=80*(3m +2)=240m +160.

s=160,400,… s=160 is within [16,240].

5. a=5, b=48: s≡0 mod5, s≡1 mod48.

s=48k +1.

48k +1 ≡(48 mod5)k +1≡3k +1≡0 mod5.

3k +1≡0 mod5 =>3k≡-1≡4 mod5 =>k≡3 mod5.

Thus, k=5m +3.

s=48*(5m +3)+1=240m +145.

s=145,385,… s=145 is within [16,240].

6. a=48, b=5: s≡0 mod48, s≡1 mod5.

s=48k.

48k ≡(48 mod5)k≡3k≡1 mod5.

3k≡1 mod5 =>k≡2 mod5.

Thus, k=5m +2.

s=48*(5m +2)=240m +96.

s=96,336,… s=96 is within [16,240].

7. a=8, b=30: s≡0 mod8, s≡1 mod30.

s=30k +1.

30k +1 ≡(30 mod8)k +1≡6k +1≡0 mod8.

6k +1≡0 mod8 =>6k≡-1≡7 mod8.

Multiply both sides by inverse of 6 mod8. Since 6*7=42≡2 mod8, not helpful. Alternatively, try values:

6k ≡7 mod8.

k=?

6*1=6≡6 mod8→6≠7.

6*3=18≡2 mod8→2≠7.

6*5=30≡6 mod8→6≠7.

6*7=42≡2 mod8→2≠7.

6*9=54≡6 mod8→6≠7.

Hmm, no solution? That can't be right. Maybe I made a mistake.

Wait, 6k ≡7 mod8.

Looking for k such that 6k mod8=7.

Let me test k=1:6→6≠7.

k=3:18→2→2≠7.

k=5:30→6→6≠7.

k=7:42→2→2≠7.

k=9:54→6→6≠7.

k=11:66→2→2≠7.

Hmm, no solution for this congruence.

Wait, maybe there's no solution for this case.

Thus, no s from this pair.

8. a=30, b=8: s≡0 mod30, s≡1 mod8.

s=30k.

30k ≡(30 mod8)k≡6k≡1 mod8.

6k≡1 mod8.

Looking for k such that 6k mod8=1.

6*1=6→6≠1.

6*3=18→2→2≠1.

6*5=30→6→6≠1.

6*7=42→2→2≠1.

6*9=54→6→6≠1.

No solution here either.

9. a=15, b=16: s≡0 mod15, s≡1 mod16.

s=16k +1.

16k +1 ≡(16 mod15)k +1≡1k +1≡0 mod15.

Thus, k +1≡0 mod15 =>k≡14 mod15.

Thus, k=15m +14.

s=16*(15m +14)+1=240m +225.

s=225,465,… s=225 is within [16,240].

10. a=16, b=15: s≡0 mod16, s≡1 mod15.

s=16k.

16k ≡(16 mod15)k≡1k≡1 mod15 =>k≡1 mod15.

Thus, k=15m +1.

s=16*(15m +1)=240m +16.

s=16,256,… s=16 is within [16,240].

So, solutions from each pair:

From (3,80): s=81

From (80,3): s=160

From (5,48): s=145

From (48,5): s=96

From (15,16): s=225

From (16,15): s=16

From (240,1): s=240

Thus, s=16,81,96,145,160,225,240.

That's seven solutions.

Wait, but earlier when I thought about d=240, s=16 comes from both (16,15) and maybe others.

But that's only seven solutions.

Wait, did I miss any?

Let me check if there are other coprime pairs.

Wait, d=240 can also be expressed as (2,120), but 2 and120 are not coprime.

Similarly, (4,60): not coprime.

(6,40): not coprime.

(10,24): not coprime.

(12,20): not coprime.

( etc.)

So, only the coprime pairs I considered earlier.

Thus, count=7.

Still not over 10.

Hmm, maybe I need a different approach.

Wait, perhaps if I consider that for each prime factor in d, the number of solutions increases.

Alternatively, perhaps the minimal d is 60, but it only gave 7 solutions.

Wait, perhaps I need to find a d that is a multiple of several small primes, allowing more factor pairs.

Alternatively, perhaps d=360.

But this is getting too time-consuming.

Alternatively, maybe I can find a pattern.

Wait, for d=6: count=3.

d=12: count=3.

d=24: count=3.

d=30: count=7.

d=60: count=7.

d=120: count=7.

d=240: count=7.

Wait, no, for d=30, count=7.

Wait, perhaps the number of solutions increases as d has more small prime factors.

Wait, perhaps the minimal d where the count exceeds 10 is d=60, but earlier I saw count=7.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier.

Wait, for d=60, s ranges from 8 to60.

We found s=16,25,36,40,45,60, and s= something else?

Wait, let me recount:

From (3,40): s=81? Wait, no, for d=60, s=81 is beyond.

Wait, no, for d=60, the solutions were s=16,21,25,36,40,45,60.

Wait, that's seven solutions.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider that the number of solutions is equal to the number of divisors of d that are <= s_max and satisfy certain conditions.

Alternatively, perhaps I can think of the number of solutions s as equal to the number of ways to write d as a product of two coprime numbers, leading to s in the required range.

But without a formula, it's hard.

Alternatively, perhaps the minimal d where the count exceeds 10 is d=60, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps looking for d with more coprime pairs.

Wait, d=210=2*3*5*7.

Number of coprime pairs would be higher.

But this is getting too complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps the minimal b is 121.

Wait, but that seems too high.

Alternatively, perhaps the minimal b is 121, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the minimal b is 21.

Wait, no, let's think.

Alternatively, perhaps the minimal b is 121, but that's a guess.

Wait, perhaps I can think of the number of solutions s for d=b-1 being equal to the number of positive integers s such that s(s-1) is divisible by d, and s is in [ceil(sqrt(d+1)),d].

Thus, for each d, the count is equal to the number of s in that range where d divides s(s-1).

But to have more than 10 solutions, d must be such that many s's satisfy this condition.

Which would happen when d has many small factors, allowing multiple s's to satisfy s(s-1) divisible by d.

Perhaps d=60 is the minimal d where count exceeds 10.

Wait, but earlier for d=60, I found 7 solutions.

Wait, perhaps I missed some.

Wait, let me recheck d=60.

d=60.

s ranges from 8 to60.

So, for d=60, count=8.

Still less than 10.

Wait, but earlier I thought I had seven, but clearly, I missed many.

So, for d=120, count=13.

Which is more than 10.

So, the minimal d where the count exceeds 10 is d=120, which corresponds to b=d+1=121.

Is there a smaller d where count>10?

Okay, so the problem says: Let b be an integer greater than or equal to 2. A positive integer n is called b-eautiful if two conditions are met. First, when you express n in base b, it has exactly two digits. Second, the sum of those two digits equals the square root of n. An example is given: 81 is 13-eautiful because 81 in base 13 is 63, and 6 + 3 equals 9, which is the square root of 81.

The task is to find the least integer b (where b is at least 2) such that there are more than ten b-eautiful integers. So, we need to find the smallest base b where there are over ten numbers that satisfy these conditions.

Hmm, okay. Let me break this down. First, I need to understand what it means for a number to have exactly two digits in base b. In any base b, a two-digit number would be something like "ab" where a and b are digits in that base. But wait, in base b, the digits can't be equal to or larger than b. So, the first digit (the "a" in "ab") must be between 1 and b-1, and the second digit (the "b" in "ab") must be between 0 and b-1.

So, when we convert "ab" from base b to base 10, it's equal to a*b + b. Wait, no, actually, it's a*b^1 + b*1. No, wait, no. Let me clarify. If the number is written as "ab" in base b, that's equal to a*b + b. Wait, no, that can't be right. Because the second digit is just the units place. So, it's a*b + digit2. So, if the two digits are, say, a and c, then the number n is equal to a*b + c. Right.

So, n = a*b + c.

Now, the second condition is that a + c = sqrt(n). So, sqrt(n) must be equal to the sum of the two digits a and c.

Since sqrt(n) must be an integer, because a and c are integers, n must be a perfect square. So, n is a perfect square, and when written in base b, it has two digits, a and c, such that a + c equals the square root of n.

So, let's write down the equations:

1. n = a*b + c
2. a + c = sqrt(n)
3. n must be a perfect square.

Also, since n is a two-digit number in base b, the smallest two-digit number in base b is 10_b, which is b in decimal. The largest two-digit number is (b-1)(b-1)_b, which is (b-1)*b + (b-1) = b^2 -1. So, n must satisfy b ≤ n ≤ b^2 -1.

But n is also a perfect square. So, n = k^2, where k is an integer. And we have that a + c = k.

So, substituting n with k^2 in equation 1: k^2 = a*b + c.

And from equation 2: a + c = k.

So, now we have two equations:

a + c = k ... (Equation A)

a*b + c = k^2 ... (Equation B)

I can solve these two equations. Let's subtract Equation A from Equation B:

(a*b + c) - (a + c) = k^2 - k

Simplify:

a*b - a = k^2 - k

Factor a on the left:

a*(b - 1) = k*(k - 1)

So, a = [k*(k - 1)] / (b - 1)

Hmm, interesting. So, a must be an integer because it's a digit in base b. So, [k*(k - 1)] must be divisible by (b - 1). That gives us a condition on b.

Also, remember that a must be a digit in base b, so 1 ≤ a ≤ b-1.

Similarly, c is a digit in base b, so 0 ≤ c ≤ b-1.

From Equation A: c = k - a.

So, c must satisfy 0 ≤ c ≤ b-1, which implies that 0 ≤ k - a ≤ b-1.

But since a is at least 1, c can be as low as k - (b-1) ?

Wait, let me think. Since a is at least 1, c = k - a is at most k - 1, and since c can't be negative, a can't be larger than k.

Wait, but a is positive, so a is at least 1, which implies that c = k - a is at most k -1.

But c must be a digit in base b, so c ≤ b-1. Therefore, k - a ≤ b -1.

Similarly, c = k - a ≥ 0, so k - a ≥ 0 → a ≤ k.

So, a must satisfy 1 ≤ a ≤ min(k, b-1).

But wait, I think another approach would be to express a in terms of k and b.

From equation: a = [k(k - 1)] / (b - 1)

Since a must be an integer, (b - 1) must divide k(k -1). Also, a must be at least 1 and at most b-1.

So, for each base b, we can look for integers k such that k^2 is in [b, b^2 -1], and k(k -1) is divisible by (b -1). Then, a would be k(k -1)/(b -1), and c would be k - a.

We need to find for each b, how many such k's exist, and then find the smallest b where the number of k's is more than 10.

So, the problem reduces to, for each base b, find the number of integers k where:

1. b ≤ k^2 ≤ b^2 -1
2. (b - 1) divides k(k - 1)
3. a = k(k -1)/(b -1) must satisfy 1 ≤ a ≤ b-1
4. c = k - a must satisfy 0 ≤ c ≤ b-1

So, let's outline the steps:

1. For each base b starting from 2 upwards, compute the range of k such that sqrt(b) ≤ k ≤ sqrt(b^2 -1). Since b ≤ k^2 ≤ b^2 -1, then sqrt(b) ≤ k ≤ sqrt(b^2 -1).

Wait, but sqrt(b^2 -1) is just slightly less than b. So, k can be from ceil(sqrt(b)) up to floor(sqrt(b^2 -1)).

But sqrt(b^2 -1) is less than b, so floor(sqrt(b^2 -1)) is b -1.

Wait, let's compute:

b^2 -1 is (b-1)(b+1). So, sqrt(b^2 -1) is approximately b - 1/(2b) for large b.

So, floor(sqrt(b^2 -1)) = b -1, but for small b, let's check:

Take b=2: b^2 -1 =3, sqrt(3)=1.732, so floor is 1.

But wait, for b=2, the two-digit numbers in base 2 are 10_2=2, 11_2=3. So, n can be 2 or 3. But sqrt(2) is about 1.414, which isn't integer, same for 3. So n has to be a perfect square, so for b=2, n can only be 1 (but 1 is a single-digit number in base 2), or 4, which is 100_2, which is three digits. So, for b=2, there are no b-eautiful numbers. So, moving on.

But in general, for base b, the possible k's are integers such that k^2 is between b and b^2 -1, so k is in [ceil(sqrt(b)), b -1].

Wait, let me check for b=3.

b=3: two-digit numbers are 10_3=3, 11_3=4, 12_3=5, 20_3=6, 21_3=7, 22_3=8. So, n can be from 3 to 8.

k^2 must be in this range, so possible k's are 2 (since 2^2=4), 3 (3^2=9 is beyond 8, so no). So, only k=2.

But sqrt(4)=2. So, n=4.

Expressed in base 3, 4 is 11_3. The sum of digits is 1+1=2, which equals sqrt(4)=2. So, yes, 4 is 3-eautiful. So, for b=3, there's 1 such number.

Similarly, for b=4:

Two-digit numbers in base 4 go from 4 (10_4) to 15 (33_4). So, n must be a perfect square between 4 and 15: 4,9,16. But 16 is beyond 15, so n can be 4,9.

For n=4 (2^2), base4 is 10_4. Sum of digits 1+0=1≠2. So, not b-eautiful.

n=9: 21_4. Sum 2+1=3≠3? Wait, 3 is sqrt(9). So, yes, 9 is 4-eautiful.

So, for b=4, we have one number:9.

Wait, let me see. So, for each base b, I need to find all k such that k^2 is a two-digit number in base b, and a + c =k, where n=k^2.

So, perhaps a better approach is to iterate over possible k and see for which bases b, the number n=k^2 is two-digit in b, and a + c =k.

But that might be time-consuming, but perhaps manageable.

Alternatively, perhaps we can find for each b, the number of possible k's.

Wait, let's think about the equation a = [k(k -1)]/(b -1). Since a must be an integer, (b -1) must divide k(k -1). So, for a given k, b -1 must be a divisor of k(k -1).

But perhaps for our purposes, it's better to fix the base b and find the possible k's.

Wait, so for each b, the possible k's are integers from ceil(sqrt(b)) to b-1, because n =k^2 must be a two-digit number in base b, which as we saw, has maximum value b^2 -1. So, k^2 ≤ b^2 -1 → k ≤ sqrt(b^2 -1) ≈ b. But since n can't be b^2, because that would be three digits in base b, so k must be less than b.

Wait, but wait: For example, when b=13, n=81=6*13 +3=81. So, 6+3=9, which is sqrt(81). So, k=9. So, in this case, k is 9, which is less than 13.

Wait, but earlier when b=4, k=3, which is less than 4.

So, generally, k can be up to b-1. Because if k = b, then k^2 = b^2, which is three digits in base b, so n can't be that.

So, for each base b, k ranges from ceil(sqrt(b)) to b-1.

Now, for each such k, we can compute a = [k(k-1)]/(b-1). a must be an integer, and a must be between 1 and b-1, inclusive. Also, c = k - a must be between 0 and b-1.

So, for each base b, the number of b-eautiful numbers is the number of k's in [ceil(sqrt(b)), b-1] such that (b -1) divides k(k -1), and the resulting a and c are valid digits.

Our goal is to find the smallest b where the number of such k's is more than 10.

So, perhaps the approach is to iterate b from 2 upwards, for each b compute the number of valid k's, and find the smallest b where this number exceeds 10.

But since the problem is asking for the minimal b where the count exceeds 10, perhaps we can find a pattern or a formula to compute the number of k's for a given b.

Let me think about the equation a = [k(k -1)]/(b -1).

Since a must be an integer, (b -1) must divide k(k -1). So, (b -1) | [k(k -1)].

But note that k and k-1 are consecutive integers, so they are coprime. So, the factors of (b -1) must be distributed between k and k-1.

So, (b -1) can be factored into two parts: d1 and d2, such that d1 divides k and d2 divides (k -1), and d1*d2 = b -1.

Alternatively, since k and k-1 are coprime, the divisors of (b -1) must be entirely within k or entirely within k-1.

Wait, perhaps it's better to model this as follows: For (b -1) to divide k(k-1), since k and k-1 are coprime, the factors of (b -1) must be entirely in k or entirely in k-1.

Wait, that's not necessarily true. Because (b -1) could have factors that divide both k and k-1, but since k and k-1 are coprime, actually, they share no common factors besides 1. So, the factors of (b -1) must be entirely in k or entirely in k-1.

Wait, perhaps I should consider the prime factors of (b -1). Since k and k-1 are coprime, any prime factor of (b -1) can't divide both k and k-1. So, all prime factors must divide either k or k-1, but not both. So, in other words, (b -1) must be such that it can be expressed as a product of a divisor of k and a divisor of k-1, but since they are coprime, the entire (b -1) must divide either k or k-1.

Wait, no, that's not quite right. Because if (b -1) is a product of two coprime numbers, say m and n, where m divides k and n divides k -1, then (b -1) = m*n, and m and n are coprime. So, in that case, (b -1) divides k(k -1).

So, for each (b -1), we can factor it into m and n, where m and n are coprime, and then for each such pair, find k such that m divides k and n divides k -1.

But this might complicate things. Alternatively, perhaps for each (b -1), we can note that (b -1) divides k(k -1), so (b -1) divides k(k -1). Since k and k -1 are consecutive, their GCD is 1. So, (b -1) must be a product of two coprime numbers, say d and e, such that d divides k and e divides k-1.

Therefore, for each such d and e where d*e = b -1 and GCD(d,e)=1, we can find solutions k ≡ 0 mod d and k ≡ 1 mod e.

By the Chinese Remainder Theorem, since d and e are coprime, there exists a unique solution modulo d*e, which is b -1.

So, for each such factorization of (b -1) into coprime d and e, we have a solution for k. But we need k to be in the range [ceil(sqrt(b)), b-1].

So, for each such d and e, the solution k is congruent to 0 mod d and 1 mod e. The minimal positive solution would be some k0, and then k can be k0 + t*(d*e) for t ≥ 0. But since k must be ≤ b-1, there might be only a limited number of solutions.

Wait, but for each factorization, we might get one solution in the range [ceil(sqrt(b)), b-1]. So, the number of solutions for k would correspond to the number of such coprime factorizations of (b -1).

But considering that (b -1) can be factored in multiple ways into coprime pairs (d, e), the number of possible k's would depend on the number of such coprime factorizations.

Wait, for a given (b -1), the number of coprime pairs (d, e) such that d*e = (b -1) is 2^{ω(n)}, where ω(n) is the number of distinct prime factors of n. Because each prime factor can be assigned to either d or e, giving 2^ω(n) possible coprime pairs.

But wait, for each such coprime pair, we get a solution for k. So, the number of solutions k would be equal to the number of coprime factorizations of (b -1), which is 2^{ω(b-1)}}.

But each coprime factorization gives a distinct solution for k. However, some solutions might lie outside the desired range [ceil(sqrt(b)), b -1].

So, for each base b, the number of b-eautiful numbers is roughly equal to the number of coprime factorizations of (b -1), but only those k's that fall into the range [ceil(sqrt(b)), b -1] are counted.

Wait, but perhaps it's more accurate to say that for each coprime pair (d, e), we can find a solution k, and then check if that k is in the desired range.

But this seems a bit involved. Maybe there's a better approach.

Another thought: The equation is a = [k(k -1)]/(b -1). Since a must be at least 1, [k(k -1)]/(b -1) ≥ 1 → k(k -1) ≥ (b -1).

But k is up to b -1, so k(k -1) = (b -1)(b -2) when k = b -1. So, for k = b -1, a = (b -1)(b -2)/(b -1) = b -2. Which is within 1 ≤ a ≤ b -1.

So, for k = b -1, a = b -2, c = k -a = (b -1) - (b -2) = 1. So, digits are (b-2) and 1, and n = a*b + c = (b-2)*b + 1 = b^2 - 2b + 1 = (b -1)^2. So, n is (b -1)^2, which is a perfect square, and the sum of digits is (b -2) + 1 = b -1, which is sqrt(n). So, this always works. So, for any base b, k = b -1 is a valid solution.

Similarly, for k = (b -1)/2, but only if (b -1) is even.

Wait, perhaps not. Maybe another approach is needed.

Alternatively, let's consider that (b -1) must divide k(k -1). So, the number of k's is equal to the number of divisors d of (b -1) such that d divides k and (b -1)/d divides k -1.

But since k and k -1 are coprime, each divisor d of (b -1) which divides k must be coprime with the co-divisor (b -1)/d, which divides k -1.

So, for each divisor d of (b -1), there's a corresponding co-divisor e = (b -1)/d.

Then, we can set up the congruence:

k ≡ 0 mod d,

k ≡ 1 mod e.

By the Chinese Remainder Theorem, since d and e are coprime (because if they had a common factor, it would divide both d and e, hence their product (b -1), but since d and e are divisors of (b -1), any common factor would have to be a factor of (b -1). But since d and e are complementary divisors, they are coprime only if d and e are coprime. Wait, not necessarily. For example, if (b -1) is 12, which factors into 3*4, but 3 and 4 are coprime. So, in that case, d=3, e=4 would be coprime. But if (b -1) is 16, which factors into 4*4, but 4 and 4 are not coprime. So, in that case, the pair (4,4) is not coprime.

So, for (d,e) to be coprime, the divisor d must be a unitary divisor. Hmm, maybe I'm getting into more complicated territory.

Alternatively, perhaps for each divisor d of (b -1), if d and (b -1)/d are coprime, then we can find a solution k for the congruence k ≡0 mod d and k ≡1 mod (b -1)/d. If d and (b -1)/d are not coprime, then we cannot guarantee a solution, because the congruences might be incompatible.

Wait, but according to the Chinese Remainder Theorem, the system of congruences k ≡ a mod m and k ≡ b mod n has a solution if and only if a ≡ b mod gcd(m,n). So, in our case, the congruences are k ≡0 mod d and k ≡1 mod e, where e = (b -1)/d.

So, for the system to have a solution, 0 ≡1 mod gcd(d, e).

But gcd(d, e) = gcd(d, (b -1)/d) = gcd(d, b -1)/d.

Wait, perhaps not straightforward. Let me compute gcd(d, e) where e = (b-1)/d.

If d is a divisor of (b -1), then e = (b -1)/d is also a divisor. The gcd(d, e) is the same as the greatest common divisor of d and (b -1)/d.

This is equal to the product of the primes in (b -1) that are common to both d and (b -1)/d. But since d and (b -1)/d are complementary divisors, their gcd is 1 only if d is a unitary divisor.

Wait, unitary divisor is a divisor d of n such that d and n/d are coprime. So, yes, in that case, the system k ≡0 mod d and k ≡1 mod e has a solution if and only if d and e are coprime.

So, only when d is a unitary divisor of (b -1), the system of congruences has a solution.

Therefore, the number of solutions k is equal to the number of unitary divisors of (b -1). Because each such d gives a unique solution modulo (b -1), which is the product of d and e.

So, the number of k's is equal to the number of unitary divisors of (b -1). Because each unitary divisor d will give a unique solution k in the range [0, b -2], perhaps.

But unitary divisors come in pairs: for each d, e = (b -1)/d is also a unitary divisor. So, except for the square case, where d = e.

So, the number of unitary divisors is 2^m, where m is the number of distinct prime factors of (b -1). Because each prime factor can be assigned to either d or e, but not both.

Wait, yes. For example, if (b -1) has prime factorization p1^a1 * p2^a2 * ... * pn^an, then each unitary divisor is of the form product of some subset of the primes. So, the number of unitary divisors is 2^m, where m is the number of distinct prime factors.

Wait, actually, no. Unitary divisors are those where each prime's exponent is either 0 or the exponent in the original number. So, for (b -1) = p1^a1 * p2^a2 * ... * pn^an, the number of unitary divisors is 2^n, where n is the number of distinct prime factors. Because for each prime, you can choose to include it with exponent a_i or exclude it.

So, the number of unitary divisors is 2^m, where m is the number of distinct prime factors of (b -1). So, for each base b, the number of k's is 2^m, where m is the number of distinct prime factors of (b -1).

But wait, does that mean that for each base b, the number of b-eautiful numbers is 2^m, where m is the number of distinct prime factors of (b -1)?

Wait, but in the earlier example, b=13, b -1=12. 12 has prime factors 2 and 3, so m=2. So, number of solutions k is 2^2=4.

But for b=13, n=81 is 6*13 + 3 =81. So, a=6, c=3. a + c=9, which is sqrt(81). So, that's one solution. Are there others?

Wait, perhaps I should check. For b=13, (b -1)=12. The unitary divisors of 12 are 1, 3, 4, 12. Because 12's prime factors are 2^2 *3^1. The unitary divisors are 1 (include none), 3 (include 3), 4 (include 2^2), 12 (include all). So, m=2, number of unitary divisors is 4.

So, for each unitary divisor d of 12, we can solve for k:

Case 1: d=1, e=12. So, k ≡0 mod1 (always true), and k ≡1 mod12. So, k=12t +1. The possible k's in [ceil(sqrt(13))=4,12] are 13 is beyond, so k=13 is too big. So, k=1: but 1 is less than 4, so not in range.

Case 2: d=3, e=4. So, solve k ≡0 mod3, k≡1 mod4.

Find k ≡0 mod3 and k≡1 mod4.

Let me solve this: k=3t. We have 3t ≡1 mod4 → 3t ≡1 → t ≡3 mod4 (since 3*3=9≡1 mod4). So, t=4s +3. So, k=3*(4s +3)=12s +9.

Within the range 4 ≤k ≤12, s=0: k=9, which is valid. s=1: k=21, which is beyond 12. So, only k=9 is valid.

Case3: d=4, e=3. So, solve k≡0 mod4, k≡1 mod3.

k=4t. 4t ≡1 mod3 → 4t ≡1 → t ≡1 mod3 (since 4≡1 mod3, so t≡1). So, t=3s +1. So, k=4*(3s +1)=12s +4.

In the range 4 ≤k ≤12, s=0: k=4, s=1: k=16 (too big). So, k=4 is a solution.

Check if k=4 is valid: n=16. But n must be two-digit in base13, which is 13 ≤n ≤168 (Wait, wait, base13 two-digit numbers go up to 12*13 +12=168. So, 16 is within that range. So, n=16.

Expressed in base13: 16 ÷13=1 with remainder 3, so 13. So, digits are 1 and 3. Sum is 1 +3=4, which equals sqrt(16)=4. So, yes, 16 is 13-eautiful.

Case4: d=12, e=1. So, solve k≡0 mod12 and k≡1 mod1. Always true, but k must be in [4,12]. So, k=12.

Check: n=12^2=144. In base13, 144 ÷13=11 with remainder 1, since 11*13=143, 144-143=1. So, digits are 11 and 1. But wait, in base13, digits go up to 12, so 11 is a valid digit. The sum is 11 +1=12, which is sqrt(144)=12. So, yes, 144 is 13-eautiful.

So, for b=13, we have four solutions: k=4,9,12. Wait, but earlier cases gave us k=4,9,12. But according to our earlier calculation, for each unitary divisor, we have one solution. So, 4 solutions, but for b=13, we have k=4,9,12, and possibly another?

Wait, perhaps I missed one. Let me see.

Wait, when d=1, e=12, we had k=1, which is below the range, so not counted. When d=3, e=4, we had k=9. When d=4, e=3, we had k=4. When d=12, e=1, we had k=12. So, three valid k's:4,9,12.

But according to the number of unitary divisors, which is 4, but perhaps one of them doesn't yield a valid k in the range. So, the number of solutions is 3, not 4.

Wait, but earlier, I thought it was 4. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake.

But regardless, for b=13, the number of b-eautiful numbers is 3.

Wait, but according to the problem statement, 81 is 13-eautiful, which is k=9. Also, we found k=4 (n=16) and k=12 (n=144). So, three numbers: 16,81,144.

Wait, but 144 is in base13: 11*13 +1=144, which is two digits. So, yes, that works.

So, for b=13, the count is 3.

But according to the earlier logic, the number of solutions is equal to the number of unitary divisors, which is 4, but one of them (k=1) is outside the range, so we have 3 solutions.

So, perhaps the general formula is that for base b, the number of b-eautiful numbers is equal to the number of unitary divisors of (b -1) minus the number of those divisors that lead to k outside the required range [ceil(sqrt(b)), b -1].

But this seems complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps the number of b-eautiful numbers is equal to the number of k's in [ceil(sqrt(b)), b -1] such that (b -1) divides k(k -1).

But how do we count that?

Wait, perhaps it's better to proceed computationally. For each base b, compute (b -1), find all k in [ceil(sqrt(b)), b -1] such that (b -1) divides k(k -1). For each such k, compute a = k(k -1)/(b -1), check if a is a digit (1 ≤ a ≤ b -1) and c =k - a is a digit (0 ≤ c ≤ b -1). If both are satisfied, count it as a valid b-eautiful number.

So, perhaps the steps are:

1. For each base b starting from 2 upwards:

   a. Compute the range of k: k_min = ceil(sqrt(b)), k_max = b -1.

   b. For each k in [k_min, k_max], check if (b -1) divides k(k -1).

   c. For each such k, compute a = k(k -1)/(b -1).

   d. Check if a is between 1 and b -1, and c =k -a is between 0 and b -1.

   e. If both a and c are valid digits, increment the count.

2. Once we find a base b where the count exceeds 10, return that b as the answer.

This seems tedious, but perhaps manageable for small b.

But since the problem is about finding the minimal b where the count exceeds 10, we can perhaps find a pattern or a formula.

Wait, another thought: The equation a = [k(k -1)]/(b -1). Since a must be an integer, and 1 ≤ a ≤ b -1, then [k(k -1)] must be between (b -1)*1 and (b -1)*(b -1).

But k(k -1) is between k_min(k_min -1) and (b -1)(b -2).

But perhaps not helpful.

Wait, perhaps it's better to express this as:

a = [k(k -1)] / (b -1) → a = [k^2 -k]/(b -1)

But n =k^2 = a*b + c = a*b + (k -a) = a*(b -1) +k

So, n = a*(b -1) +k → k^2 = a*(b -1) +k → k^2 -k = a*(b -1)

Which brings us back to the original equation.

Hmm.

Alternatively, let's consider that a*(b -1) =k(k -1).

Since a and b are positive integers, with a ≤ b -1, and k ≤ b -1.

So, for each base b, the number of solutions is equal to the number of k's in [ceil(sqrt(b)), b -1] such that k(k -1) is divisible by (b -1), and the quotient a is between 1 and b -1.

But how can we find the number of such k's?

Wait, perhaps for a given b, the number of k's is equal to the number of divisors of (b -1) that are less than or equal to b -1, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps for each divisor d of (b -1), we can set d = a, then a = d, and k(k -1) = d*(b -1). So, k^2 -k -d*(b -1) =0.

This is a quadratic in k: k^2 -k -d*(b -1)=0.

The discriminant is 1 +4d*(b -1). For k to be integer, the discriminant must be a perfect square. So, 1 +4d*(b -1) must be a perfect square.

Let me denote discriminant D =1 +4d*(b -1)=m^2, where m is integer.

So, m^2 -4d*(b -1)=1.

This is a form of Pell's equation, but perhaps it's not helpful.

Alternatively, perhaps the number of solutions is limited for each b.

But perhaps stepping back, let's think about the initial problem.

We need to find the smallest b where the number of b-eautiful numbers exceeds 10. So, perhaps the minimal such b is 121, but that seems too high. Alternatively, perhaps 101.

But maybe not. Let's think about how the number of solutions grows with b.

Each time (b -1) has more factors, the number of possible k's increases.

In particular, when (b -1) is a number with many unitary divisors, which is when (b -1) is square-free with many prime factors.

Because the number of unitary divisors is 2^m, where m is the number of distinct prime factors. So, for (b -1) being a product of m distinct primes, it has 2^m unitary divisors, leading to 2^m solutions for k, but some may be outside the required range.

So, to maximize the number of unitary divisors, we need (b -1) to be a product of as many distinct primes as possible.

So, for example, if (b -1) is the product of the first t primes, then it has 2^t unitary divisors, which would give up to 2^t solutions for k.

But since each solution k must be ≤ b -1, which is the product, the number of solutions would be roughly 2^t, but perhaps some are excluded.

So, to get more than 10 solutions, we need 2^t >10 → t≥4, since 2^3=8 <10, 2^4=16>10.

So, if (b -1) is the product of 4 distinct primes, it will have 16 unitary divisors, leading to 16 possible k's, but some of them might be below the required k_min.

So, perhaps the minimal b is such that (b -1) is the product of the first 4 primes, which is 2*3*5*7=210. So, b=211.

But wait, that seems quite large. Maybe there's a smaller b where (b -1) has 4 distinct prime factors, but perhaps not necessarily the first four.

Alternatively, perhaps a smaller number with 4 distinct prime factors exists, such as 2*3*5*7=210, but maybe 2*3*5*7 is 210, which is the smallest number with 4 distinct prime factors. So, b=211 would be the minimal b with 16 unitary divisors, leading to 16 possible k's, but only a subset of them would be in the required range.

But perhaps the number of valid k's is less than 16.

Wait, for b=211, (b -1)=210=2*3*5*7. So, the number of unitary divisors is 2^4=16. Each unitary divisor d gives a solution k as follows:

For each d, solve k≡0 mod d and k≡1 mod (210/d).

Since d and e=210/d are coprime, each pair (d,e) will give a unique solution modulo 210.

So, for each d, the minimal solution k0 is in the range [1,210]. Then, the next solution would be k0 +210, which is beyond our k_max=210. So, only one solution per pair.

So, for each of the 16 unitary divisors, we get a unique k in [1,210]. Now, we need to check if k is in [ceil(sqrt(211)),210], which is [15,210].

So, all 16 solutions for k would be in this range, except possibly those where k is less than 15.

But let's see: For d=1, e=210. Solve k ≡0 mod1 (always true) and k≡1 mod210. So, k=210t +1. The minimal k is 1, which is less than 15. So, discard.

For d=2, e=105. Solve k≡0 mod2 and k≡1 mod105.

k=2t. 2t ≡1 mod105 → 2t ≡1 → t ≡53 mod105. So, t=105s +53. So, k=2*(105s +53)=210s +106. Minimal k=106, which is ≥15. So, valid.

Similarly, for d=3, e=70. Solve k≡0 mod3 and k≡1 mod70.

k=3t. 3t ≡1 mod70 → 3t ≡1 → t ≡47 mod70. So, t=70s +47. k=3*(70s +47)=210s +141. Minimal k=141≥15. Valid.

d=5, e=42. Solve k≡0 mod5, k≡1 mod42.

k=5t. 5t ≡1 mod42 → 5t ≡1 → t ≡17 mod42 (since 5*17=85≡1 mod42). So, t=42s +17. k=5*(42s +17)=210s +85. Minimal k=85≥15. Valid.

d=6, e=35. Wait, but 6 and 35 are coprime, so this is a valid pair. Solve k≡0 mod6, k≡1 mod35.

k=6t. 6t ≡1 mod35 → 6t ≡1 → t ≡6 mod35 (since 6*6=36≡1 mod35). So, t=35s +6. k=6*(35s +6)=210s +36. Minimal k=36≥15. Valid.

d=7, e=30. Solve k≡0 mod7, k≡1 mod30.

k=7t. 7t ≡1 mod30 → 7t ≡1 → t ≡13 mod30 (since 7*13=91≡1 mod30). So, t=30s +13. k=7*(30s +13)=210s +91. Minimal k=91≥15. Valid.

d=10, e=21. Solve k≡0 mod10, k≡1 mod21.

k=10t. 10t ≡1 mod21 →10t ≡1 → t ≡19 mod21 (since 10*19=190≡190-9*21=190-189=1 mod21). So, t=21s +19. k=10*(21s +19)=210s +190. Minimal k=190≥15. Valid.

d=14, e=15. Solve k≡0 mod14, k≡1 mod15.

k=14t. 14t ≡1 mod15 →14t ≡1 → (-1)t ≡1 → t≡-1≡14 mod15. So, t=15s +14. k=14*(15s +14)=210s +196. Minimal k=196≥15. Valid.

d=15, e=14. Solve k≡0 mod15, k≡1 mod14.

k=15t. 15t ≡1 mod14 →15t ≡1 → t ≡1 mod14. So, t=14s +1. k=15*(14s +1)=210s +15. Minimal k=15≥15. Valid.

d=21, e=10. Solve k≡0 mod21, k≡1 mod10.

k=21t. 21t ≡1 mod10 →1t ≡1 mod10 → t≡1 mod10. So, t=10s +1. k=21*(10s +1)=210s +21. Minimal k=21≥15. Valid.

d=30, e=7. Solve k≡0 mod30, k≡1 mod7.

k=30t. 30t ≡1 mod7 →2t ≡1 mod7 → t≡4 mod7. So, t=7s +4. k=30*(7s +4)=210s +120. Minimal k=120≥15. Valid.

d=35, e=6. Solve k≡0 mod35, k≡1 mod6.

k=35t. 35t ≡1 mod6 →35 mod6=5, so 5t ≡1 mod6 → t≡5 mod6. So, t=6s +5. k=35*(6s +5)=210s +175. Minimal k=175≥15. Valid.

d=42, e=5. Solve k≡0 mod42, k≡1 mod5.

k=42t. 42t ≡1 mod5 →2t ≡1 mod5 → t≡3 mod5. So, t=5s +3. k=42*(5s +3)=210s +126. Minimal k=126≥15. Valid.

d=70, e=3. Solve k≡0 mod70, k≡1 mod3.

k=70t. 70t ≡1 mod3 →1t ≡1 mod3 →t≡1 mod3. So, t=3s +1. k=70*(3s +1)=210s +70. Minimal k=70≥15. Valid.

d=105, e=2. Solve k≡0 mod105, k≡1 mod2.

k=105t. 105t ≡1 mod2 →t ≡1 mod2. So, t=2s +1. k=105*(2s +1)=210s +105. Minimal k=105≥15. Valid.

d=210, e=1. Solve k≡0 mod210, k≡1 mod1. Always true, but k must be ≤210. So, k=210 is a solution, but n=k^2=44100, which is way beyond the two-digit number in base211. Wait, no, n must be two-digit in base211, which is up to 210*211 +210 = 44310 +210=44520. But 210^2=44100, which is less than 44520. So, n=44100 is a two-digit number in base211: 210*211 + 0? Wait, no. Wait, 210 in base211 is 10_211, which is 211. So, 210 is 10_211 minus 1, which is 10_211 -1 = 210. So, 210 is 210_10, but in base211, it's 0*211 +210, which is two digits: 0 and 210. Wait, but in base211, the digits must be less than 211. So, 0 and 210 are valid digits.

So, n=210^2=44100.

Expressed in base211: 44100 ÷211=209*211=44099, remainder 1. So, 44100=209*211 +1. So, digits are 209 and 1. So, a=209, c=1. Sum is 210, which is sqrt(44100)=210. So, yes, valid.

So, for each of the 16 unitary divisors, we have a k in the range [15,210], except for d=1 which gives k=1, which is below 15. So, the number of valid k's is 16 -1=15.

Wait, but earlier in our analysis for b=13, we had 3 solutions, but the number of unitary divisors was 4. So, perhaps the formula isn't directly applicable.

But in this case, for b=211, we have 15 valid k's, each corresponding to a unitary divisor except d=1. So, 15 solutions.

But 15 is more than 10, so b=211 would satisfy the condition.

But is 211 the minimal such b? Because there might be smaller b where (b -1) has enough unitary divisors such that the number of k's exceeds 10.

So, let's check smaller b's.

Let's consider b=61. Then, b-1=60=2^2*3*5. The number of unitary divisors is 2^3=8, since 60 has 3 distinct primes. So, 8 unitary divisors.

But for each of these, we'd get a solution k, but some might be below the required k_min=ceil(sqrt(61))=8.

So, let's check:

For b=61, (b -1)=60. Unitary divisors are 1, 3, 4, 5, 12, 15, 20, 60.

Now, for each d in [1,3,4,5,12,15,20,60], solve k ≡0 mod d and k≡1 mod (60/d).

Case d=1: k=60t +1. Minimal k=1 <8. Discard.

d=3: e=20. Solve k≡0 mod3, k≡1 mod20.

k=3t. 3t≡1 mod20 → t≡7 mod20. So, t=20s +7. k=3*(20s +7)=60s +21. Minimal k=21≥8. Valid.

d=4: e=15. Solve k≡0 mod4, k≡1 mod15.

k=4t. 4t≡1 mod15 →4t≡1 →t≡4 mod15 (since 4*4=16≡1). So, t=15s +4. k=4*(15s +4)=60s +16. Minimal k=16≥8. Valid.

d=5: e=12. Solve k≡0 mod5, k≡1 mod12.

k=5t. 5t≡1 mod12 →5t≡1 →t≡5 mod12. So, t=12s +5. k=5*(12s +5)=60s +25. Minimal k=25≥8. Valid.

d=12: e=5. Solve k≡0 mod12, k≡1 mod5.

k=12t. 12t≡1 mod5 →2t≡1 →t≡3 mod5. So, t=5s +3. k=12*(5s +3)=60s +36. Minimal k=36≥8. Valid.

d=15: e=4. Solve k≡0 mod15, k≡1 mod4.

k=15t. 15t≡1 mod4 →15 mod4=3, so 3t≡1 →t≡3 mod4. So, t=4s +3. k=15*(4s +3)=60s +45. Minimal k=45≥8. Valid.

d=20: e=3. Solve k≡0 mod20, k≡1 mod3.

k=20t. 20t≡1 mod3 →2t≡1 →t≡2 mod3. So, t=3s +2. k=20*(3s +2)=60s +40. Minimal k=40≥8. Valid.

d=60: e=1. Solve k≡0 mod60, k≡1 mod1. Always true, so k=60. But k_max=60 (since b=61, k_max=60). So, valid.

So, for each d, except d=1, we have a valid k. So, total valid k's: 7.

Wait, but there are 8 unitary divisors, but one (d=1) gives k=1, which is below 8. So, 7 valid k's. So, for b=61, count=7.

But 7 is less than 10. So, not enough.

Next, let's try b=121. Then, b-1=120=2^3*3*5. The number of unitary divisors is 2^3=8, same as 60. So, probably similar count.

But let's see:

b=121, so k_min=ceil(sqrt(121))=11.

(b-1)=120, unitary divisors are 1,3,4,5,8,15,20,24,40,60,120.

Wait, wait, no. Wait, unitary divisors are those where each prime is taken with exponent 0 or all exponents. Since 120=2^3*3^1*5^1, the unitary divisors are:

1, 2^3=8, 3^1=3, 5^1=5, 2^3*3=24, 2^3*5=40, 3*5=15, 2^3*3*5=120.

So, unitary divisors are 1,3,5,8,15,24,40,120. So, 8 unitary divisors.

For each d in [1,3,5,8,15,24,40,120], solve k ≡0 mod d, k≡1 mod (120/d).

Case d=1: k=120t +1. Minimal k=1 <11. Discard.

d=3: e=40. Solve k≡0 mod3, k≡1 mod40.

k=3t. 3t≡1 mod40 → t≡27 mod40. So, t=40s +27. k=3*(40s +27)=120s +81. Minimal k=81≥11. Valid.

d=5: e=24. Solve k≡0 mod5, k≡1 mod24.

k=5t. 5t≡1 mod24 →5t≡1 →t≡5 mod24 (since 5*5=25≡1). So, t=24s +5. k=5*(24s +5)=120s +25. Minimal k=25≥11. Valid.

d=8: e=15. Solve k≡0 mod8, k≡1 mod15.

k=8t. 8t≡1 mod15 →8t≡1 →t≡2 mod15 (since 8*2=16≡1). So, t=15s +2. k=8*(15s +2)=120s +16. Minimal k=16≥11. Valid.

d=15: e=8. Solve k≡0 mod15, k≡1 mod8.

k=15t. 15t≡1 mod8 →15 mod8=7→7t≡1 →t≡7 mod8. So, t=8s +7. k=15*(8s +7)=120s +105. Minimal k=105≥11. Valid.

d=24: e=5. Solve k≡0 mod24, k≡1 mod5.

k=24t. 24t≡1 mod5 →24 mod5=4→4t≡1 →t≡4 mod5. So, t=5s +4. k=24*(5s +4)=120s +96. Minimal k=96≥11. Valid.

d=40: e=3. Solve k≡0 mod40, k≡1 mod3.

k=40t. 40t≡1 mod3 →40 mod3=1→1t≡1 →t≡1 mod3. So, t=3s +1. k=40*(3s +1)=120s +40. Minimal k=40≥11. Valid.

d=120: e=1. Solve k≡0 mod120, k≡1 mod1. So, k=120. Which is within [11,120]. So, valid.

So, for each d except d=1, we have a valid k. So, 7 valid k's. Again, same as b=61.

So, count=7, which is still less than 10.

Hmm, so maybe we need a b where (b -1) has more unitary divisors. Let's try b=85. Then, b-1=84=2^2*3*7. Unitary divisors are 1,3,4,7,12,21,28,84. So, 8 unitary divisors.

Check for each d:

d=1: k=84t +1. Minimal k=1 <9 (since sqrt(85)=9.21). So, discard.

d=3: e=28. Solve k≡0 mod3, k≡1 mod28.

k=3t. 3t≡1 mod28 →3t≡1 →t≡19 mod28. So, t=28s +19. k=3*(28s +19)=84s +57. Minimal k=57≥9. Valid.

d=4: e=21. Solve k≡0 mod4, k≡1 mod21.

k=4t. 4t≡1 mod21 →4t≡1 →t≡16 mod21. So, t=21s +16. k=4*(21s +16)=84s +64. Minimal k=64≥9. Valid.

d=7: e=12. Solve k≡0 mod7, k≡1 mod12.

k=7t. 7t≡1 mod12 →7t≡1 →t≡7 mod12 (since 7*7=49≡1 mod12). So, t=12s +7. k=7*(12s +7)=84s +49. Minimal k=49≥9. Valid.

d=12: e=7. Solve k≡0 mod12, k≡1 mod7.

k=12t. 12t≡1 mod7 →12 mod7=5→5t≡1 →t≡3 mod7. So, t=7s +3. k=12*(7s +3)=84s +36. Minimal k=36≥9. Valid.

d=21: e=4. Solve k≡0 mod21, k≡1 mod4.

k=21t. 21t≡1 mod4 →21 mod4=1→1t≡1 →t≡1 mod4. So, t=4s +1. k=21*(4s +1)=84s +21. Minimal k=21≥9. Valid.

d=28: e=3. Solve k≡0 mod28, k≡1 mod3.

k=28t. 28t≡1 mod3 →28 mod3=1→1t≡1 →t≡1 mod3. So, t=3s +1. k=28*(3s +1)=84s +28. Minimal k=28≥9. Valid.

d=84: e=1. Solve k≡0 mod84, k≡1 mod1. So, k=84. Within [9,84]. Valid.

So, for each d except d=1, we have a valid k. So, 7 solutions again.

Hmm, same as before. So, seems that with (b -1) having 8 unitary divisors, we only get 7 valid k's.

We need to find a b where (b -1) has enough unitary divisors such that the number of valid k's exceeds 10.

So, perhaps we need (b -1) to have 12 unitary divisors, leading to 12 solutions, but subtract those that are below k_min.

Wait, but the number of unitary divisors is 2^m, where m is the number of distinct prime factors.

So, to get 2^m ≥12, m needs to be at least 4, as 2^4=16.

So, the smallest (b -1) with 4 distinct prime factors is 2*3*5*7=210, which we already considered earlier.

So, for b=211, (b -1)=210, which has 16 unitary divisors, leading to 15 valid k's (excluding d=1). So, 15>10, so b=211 is a candidate.

But is there a smaller b where (b -1) has 4 distinct prime factors? The next smallest would be 2*3*5*7=210, which is already the smallest. So, 210 is the minimal (b -1) with 4 distinct prime factors, leading to b=211.

But wait, what about b=127? Then, (b -1)=126=2*3^2*7. The number of unitary divisors is 2^3=8, since 126 has three distinct primes. So, same as before.

Alternatively, perhaps a number with higher exponents but more factors.

Wait, but unitary divisors depend only on the distinct primes, not their exponents. So, 2^3*3*5*7 would still have 16 unitary divisors.

So, the minimal b where (b -1) has 4 distinct primes is 211.

But wait, let's check another b: b=101. Then, (b -1)=100=2^2*5^2. The number of unitary divisors is 2^2=4 (primes 2 and5). So, 4 unitary divisors.

But for b=101, the count would be less than 10.

Alternatively, let's try b=68. Then, (b -1)=67, which is prime. So, unitary divisors are 1 and 67. So, only two k's: k=67 (valid) and k=1 (invalid). So, count=1.

Not helpful.

Alternatively, b=122. Then, (b-1)=121=11^2. Unitary divisors are 1 and 121. So, two k's: k=121 (valid) and k=1 (invalid). Count=1.

Not helpful.

Alternatively, b=128. (b-1)=127, which is prime. So, same as above.

Alternatively, b=257. (b-1)=256=2^8. Unitary divisors: 1,2,4,8,16,32,64,128,256. But wait, for a number that's a power of a single prime, the number of unitary divisors is equal to the number of exponents, which is 9 here. So, 9 unitary divisors.

Wait, no. Wait, for a prime power p^k, the number of unitary divisors is 2 (1 and p^k). Because unitary divisors must include all exponents or none. Wait, no, for p^k, the unitary divisors are 1 and p^k. So, only 2 unitary divisors.

So, for (b -1)=256=2^8, unitary divisors are 1 and 256. So, two k's: k=256 (valid) and k=1 (invalid). So, count=1.

Not helpful.

Hmm, so seems that the only way to get a high number of solutions is to have (b -1) with many distinct prime factors.

Thus, the minimal b where (b -1) has four distinct prime factors is b=211, leading to 15 solutions.

But wait, let's check another b: b=106. (b -1)=105=3*5*7. So, three distinct primes. Number of unitary divisors is 8. So, let's see how many valid k's.

b=106: k_min=ceil(sqrt(106))=11.

(b-1)=105. Unitary divisors: 1,3,5,7,15,21,35,105.

For each d:

d=1: k=105t +1. Minimal k=1 <11. Discard.

d=3: e=35. Solve k≡0 mod3, k≡1 mod35.

k=3t. 3t≡1 mod35 →t≡12 mod35. So, t=35s +12. k=3*(35s +12)=105s +36. Minimal k=36≥11. Valid.

d=5: e=21. Solve k≡0 mod5, k≡1 mod21.

k=5t. 5t≡1 mod21 →t≡13 mod21. So, t=21s +13. k=5*(21s +13)=105s +65. Minimal k=65≥11. Valid.

d=7: e=15. Solve k≡0 mod7, k≡1 mod15.

k=7t. 7t≡1 mod15 →7t≡1 →t≡13 mod15. So, t=15s +13. k=7*(15s +13)=105s +91. Minimal k=91≥11. Valid.

d=15: e=7. Solve k≡0 mod15, k≡1 mod7.

k=15t. 15t≡1 mod7 →15 mod7=1→1t≡1 →t≡1 mod7. So, t=7s +1. k=15*(7s +1)=105s +15. Minimal k=15≥11. Valid.

d=21: e=5. Solve k≡0 mod21, k≡1 mod5.

k=21t. 21t≡1 mod5 →21 mod5=1→1t≡1 →t≡1 mod5. So, t=5s +1. k=21*(5s +1)=105s +21. Minimal k=21≥11. Valid.

d=35: e=3. Solve k≡0 mod35, k≡1 mod3.

k=35t. 35t≡1 mod3 →35 mod3=2→2t≡1 →t≡2 mod3. So, t=3s +2. k=35*(3s +2)=105s +70. Minimal k=70≥11. Valid.

d=105: e=1. Solve k≡0 mod105, k≡1 mod1. So, k=105. Which is within [11,105]. Valid.

So, for each d except d=1, we have a valid k. So, 7 solutions. Again, same as before.

So, seems that to get more than 10 solutions, we need (b -1) to have four distinct prime factors, leading to 16 unitary divisors, with 15 valid k's.

Thus, the minimal such b is 211.

Wait, but let's check another b: b=121. (b-1)=120=2^3*3*5. Unitary divisors: 1,3,5,8,15,24,40,120. 8 unitary divisors. So, 7 solutions, as before.

So, yes, the minimal b is 211.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To solve the problem, we need to find the smallest base \( b \) such that there are more than ten \( b \)-eautiful integers. A number \( n \) is \( b \)-eautiful if it has exactly two digits in base \( b \) and the sum of these digits equals \( \sqrt{n} \). 

### Key Steps and Analysis:

1. **Understanding the Problem**:
   - A two-digit number in base \( b \) is of the form \( ab_b \), where \( a \) and \( b \) are digits in base \( b \). This translates to \( n = a \cdot b + c \) in decimal.
   - The sum of the digits \( a + c \) must equal \( \sqrt{n} \), implying \( n \) is a perfect square.

2. **Formulating the Equations**:
   - Let \( n = k^2 \), where \( k \) is an integer.
   - From the digit sum condition: \( a + c = k \).
   - From the number representation: \( k^2 = a \cdot b + c \).
   - Solving these, we derive \( a = \frac{k(k - 1)}{b - 1} \), which must be an integer.

3. **Finding Valid \( k \) Values**:
   - For each base \( b \), \( k \) must satisfy \( \lceil \sqrt{b} \rceil \leq k \leq b - 1 \).
   - \( (b - 1) \) must divide \( k(k - 1) \), and \( a \) and \( c \) must be valid digits in base \( b \).

4. **Maximizing the Number of Solutions**:
   - The number of valid \( k \) values depends on the number of unitary divisors of \( (b - 1) \). Each unitary divisor pair contributes a solution for \( k \).
   - To exceed ten \( b \)-eautiful numbers, \( (b - 1) \) must have at least 11 unitary divisors, which occurs when \( (b - 1) \) has four distinct prime factors.

5. **Identifying the Minimal \( b \)**:
   - The smallest \( (b - 1) \) with four distinct prime factors is \( 210 \) (product of the first four primes: \( 2, 3, 5, 7 \)).
   - Thus, \( b = 211 \) is the minimal base where there are more than ten \( b \)-eautiful numbers.

### Final Answer:
The least integer \( b \) for which there are more than ten \( b \)-eautiful integers is \(\boxed{211}\).
