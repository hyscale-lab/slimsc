Okay, so I have this complex number problem to solve. The problem is asking for the largest possible real part of the expression \[(75 + 117i)z + \frac{96 + 144i}{z}\], where \( z \) is a complex number with magnitude \( |z| = 4 \). Hmm, alright, let me try to break this down step by step.

First, since \( z \) is a complex number with \( |z| = 4 \), I know that \( z \) can be written in the form \( z = 4e^{i\theta} \) where \( \theta \) is the argument of \( z \). That's because the magnitude is 4, so representing it in polar form makes sense here.

Now, substituting \( z = 4e^{i\theta} \) into the expression, I can write:

\[
(75 + 117i) \cdot 4e^{i\theta} + \frac{96 + 144i}{4e^{i\theta}}
\]

Simplifying each term:

The first term becomes \( 4(75 + 117i)e^{i\theta} \). Let me compute 4 times (75 + 117i):

\( 4 * 75 = 300 \)

\( 4 * 117 = 468 \)

So, the first term is \( (300 + 468i)e^{i\theta} \).

The second term is \( \frac{96 + 144i}{4e^{i\theta}} \). Let me compute 96 + 144i divided by 4:

\( 96 / 4 = 24 \)

\( 144 / 4 = 36 \)

So, the second term is \( (24 + 36i)e^{-i\theta} \) because dividing by \( e^{i\theta} \) is the same as multiplying by \( e^{-i\theta} \).

So now, the expression becomes:

\[
(300 + 468i)e^{i\theta} + (24 + 36i)e^{-i\theta}
\]

Hmm, okay. Now, I need to find the real part of this expression because the problem is asking for the largest possible real part. So, let me denote this entire expression as \( E \):

\[
E = (300 + 468i)e^{i\theta} + (24 + 36i)e^{-i\theta}
\]

To find the real part of \( E \), I can write \( e^{i\theta} \) as \( \cos\theta + i\sin\theta \) and \( e^{-i\theta} \) as \( \cos\theta - i\sin\theta \). Let me expand each term.

First, expand \( (300 + 468i)(\cos\theta + i\sin\theta) \):

Multiply 300 by \( \cos\theta \): \( 300\cos\theta \)

Multiply 300 by \( i\sin\theta \): \( 300i\sin\theta \)

Multiply 468i by \( \cos\theta \): \( 468i\cos\theta \)

Multiply 468i by \( i\sin\theta \): \( 468i^2\sin\theta \). Since \( i^2 = -1 \), this becomes \( -468\sin\theta \).

So, combining these terms:

Real parts: \( 300\cos\theta - 468\sin\theta \)

Imaginary parts: \( 300\sin\theta + 468\cos\theta \)

Similarly, expanding \( (24 + 36i)(\cos\theta - i\sin\theta) \):

Multiply 24 by \( \cos\theta \): \( 24\cos\theta \)

Multiply 24 by \( -i\sin\theta \): \( -24i\sin\theta \)

Multiply 36i by \( \cos\theta \): \( 36i\cos\theta \)

Multiply 36i by \( -i\sin\theta \): \( -36i^2\sin\theta = 36\sin\theta \) (since \( i^2 = -1 \)).

So, combining these terms:

Real parts: \( 24\cos\theta + 36\sin\theta \)

Imaginary parts: \( -24\sin\theta + 36\cos\theta \)

Now, adding both expanded terms together for the entire expression \( E \):

Real parts:

\( (300\cos\theta - 468\sin\theta) + (24\cos\theta + 36\sin\theta) = (300 + 24)\cos\theta + (-468 + 36)\sin\theta = 324\cos\theta - 432\sin\theta \)

Imaginary parts:

\( (300\sin\theta + 468\cos\theta) + (-24\sin\theta + 36\cos\theta) = (300 - 24)\sin\theta + (468 + 36)\cos\theta = 276\sin\theta + 504\cos\theta \)

So, the expression \( E \) can be written as:

\[
E = [324\cos\theta - 432\sin\theta] + i[276\sin\theta + 504\cos\theta]
\]

Since we're only interested in the real part, let's denote \( \text{Re}(E) = 324\cos\theta - 432\sin\theta \). We need to find the maximum value of this expression as \( \theta \) varies.

To find the maximum of \( A\cos\theta + B\sin\theta \), where \( A \) and \( B \) are constants, the maximum value is \( \sqrt{A^2 + B^2} \). This is a standard result from trigonometry where the maximum of such an expression is the amplitude, which is the square root of the sum of the squares of the coefficients.

Wait, but in our case, the expression is \( 324\cos\theta - 432\sin\theta \), which can be written as \( A\cos\theta + B\sin\theta \) where \( A = 324 \) and \( B = -432 \).

So, the maximum real part is \( \sqrt{A^2 + B^2} \).

Calculating that:

\( A^2 = 324^2 \)
\( B^2 = (-432)^2 = 432^2 \)

Let me compute these squares:

324 squared: 324 * 324. Hmm, 300^2 is 90,000, 24^2 is 576, and cross term is 2*300*24=14,400. So,

\( 324^2 = (300 + 24)^2 = 300^2 + 2*300*24 + 24^2 = 90000 + 14400 + 576 = 90000 + 14400 is 104400, plus 576 is 104,976.

Similarly, 432 squared: 432 * 432. Let me compute this.

Well, 400^2 = 160,000

32^2 = 1,024

Cross term is 2*400*32 = 25,600

So,

\( (400 + 32)^2 = 400^2 + 2*400*32 + 32^2 = 160,000 + 25,600 + 1,024 = 160,000 + 25,600 = 185,600; 185,600 + 1,024 = 186,624.

So, \( A^2 + B^2 = 104,976 + 186,624 = 291,600 \).

Wait, 104,976 + 186,624: 104,976 + 186,624.

Let me add:

104,976 + 186,624:

100,000 + 180,000 = 280,000

4,976 + 6,624 = 11,600.

So, total is 280,000 + 11,600 = 291,600.

So, the square root of 291,600. Let me see.

What's sqrt(291600). Well, 500^2 is 250,000. 540^2 is 291,600 because 54^2 is 2,916, so 540^2 is 291,600.

Yes, because 540 * 540 = (500 + 40)^2 = 500^2 + 2*500*40 + 40^2 = 250,000 + 40,000 + 1,600 = 291,600.

So, sqrt(291,600) = 540.

Therefore, the maximum real part is 540.

Wait, but hold on a second. Because the expression is \( A\cos\theta + B\sin\theta \), the maximum value is indeed sqrt(A² + B²). But in our case, it's 324 cosθ - 432 sinθ, which is A cosθ + B sinθ with B negative. But since we're squaring, the sign doesn't matter. So, yes, the maximum is 540.

Wait, but just to make sure I didn't make any miscalculations. Let me double-check the computation steps.

Original expression after substitution:

E = (300 + 468i)e^{iθ} + (24 + 36i)e^{-iθ}

Expanding both terms:

First term:

(300 + 468i)(cosθ + i sinθ) = 300 cosθ + 300i sinθ + 468i cosθ + 468i² sinθ

Which is 300 cosθ - 468 sinθ + i(300 sinθ + 468 cosθ)

Second term:

(24 + 36i)(cosθ - i sinθ) = 24 cosθ -24i sinθ +36i cosθ -36i² sinθ

Which is 24 cosθ + 36 sinθ + i(-24 sinθ + 36 cosθ)

Adding the two, real parts:

(300 cosθ -468 sinθ) + (24 cosθ +36 sinθ) = 324 cosθ -432 sinθ

Imaginary parts: 

(300 sinθ +468 cosθ) + (-24 sinθ +36 cosθ) = 276 sinθ +504 cosθ

So, that seems correct.

Then, taking the real part as 324 cosθ -432 sinθ.

So, to find its maximum, we use the formula sqrt(A² + B²) where A = 324, B = -432.

Which is sqrt(324² + (-432)^2) = sqrt(104976 + 186624) = sqrt(291600) = 540.

So, yes, correct.

Therefore, the largest possible real part is 540.

To find the largest possible real part of the expression \((75 + 117i)z + \frac{96 + 144i}{z}\) where \(|z| = 4\), we start by expressing \(z\) in polar form as \(z = 4e^{i\theta}\). Substituting this into the expression, we rewrite it as:

\[
(300 + 468i)e^{i\theta} + (24 + 36i)e^{-i\theta}
\]

Expanding both terms using \(e^{i\theta} = \cos\theta + i\sin\theta\) and \(e^{-i\theta} = \cos\theta - i\sin\theta\), we separate the real and imaginary parts:

- Real parts: \(324\cos\theta - 432\sin\theta\)
- Imaginary parts: \(276\sin\theta + 504\cos\theta\)

The real part of the expression is \(324\cos\theta - 432\sin\theta\). To find its maximum value, we use the formula for the maximum of \(A\cos\theta + B\sin\theta\), which is \(\sqrt{A^2 + B^2}\). Calculating:

\[
\sqrt{324^2 + (-432)^2} = \sqrt{104976 + 186624} = \sqrt{291600} = 540
\]

Thus, the largest possible real part is \(\boxed{540}\).
