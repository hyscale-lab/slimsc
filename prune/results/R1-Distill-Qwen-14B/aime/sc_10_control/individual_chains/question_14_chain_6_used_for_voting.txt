Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the greatest four-digit number N. The special property of N is that if you change any one of its digits to 1, the resulting number is divisible by 7. Then, I have to find Q + R where Q is the quotient and R is the remainder when N is divided by 1000.

Hmm, let me break this down. First, I'm looking for a four-digit number, so it's between 9999 and 1000. But since we want the greatest one, I should probably start checking from 9999 downwards until I find such a number.

Wait, but the problem says whenever one of its digits is changed to 1, the number is divisible by 7. So for N, changing any digit (thousands, hundreds, tens, units) to 1 should result in a number divisible by 7.

That means for each digit position in N, if I replace it with 1, the new number must be divisible by 7. So for example, if N is abcd, then replacing the thousands digit a with 1 gives 1bcd, which must be divisible by 7. Similarly, replacing b with 1 gives a1cd, which must also be divisible by 7, and so on for c and d.

So, N has four digits. Let me denote N as D = d1 d2 d3 d4, where d1 is the thousands digit, d2 the hundreds, d3 the tens, and d4 the units.

Now, for each i from 1 to 4, if I replace di with 1, the new number must be divisible by 7.

So, I need to find D such that:

1. 1 d2 d3 d4 is divisible by 7
2. d1 1 d3 d4 is divisible by 7
3. d1 d2 1 d4 is divisible by 7
4. d1 d2 d3 1 is divisible by 7

Hmm, okay. So each of these four modified numbers must be divisible by 7.

Since we're looking for the greatest such D, it's probably best to start checking from 9999 downwards until I find a D that satisfies all four conditions.

But that might take a long time. Maybe there's a smarter way.

Let me think about the divisibility by 7. There are some rules for checking divisibility by 7, but I don't remember exactly. One method is to take the last digit, double it, subtract it from the rest of the number, and see if the result is divisible by 7. But I'm not sure if that will help here.

Alternatively, perhaps I can model each condition as a congruence.

Let me consider each modified number.

Let me represent D as 1000d1 + 100d2 + 10d3 + d4.

So, when I replace d1 with 1, the number becomes 1000*1 + 100d2 + 10d3 + d4 = 1000 + 100d2 + 10d3 + d4. This must be divisible by 7.

Similarly, replacing d2 with 1 gives 1000d1 + 100*1 + 10d3 + d4 = 1000d1 + 100 + 10d3 + d4, which must be divisible by 7.

Replacing d3 with 1 gives 1000d1 + 100d2 + 10*1 + d4 = 1000d1 + 100d2 + 10 + d4, must be divisible by 7.

Replacing d4 with 1 gives 1000d1 + 100d2 + 10d3 + 1, which must be divisible by 7.

So, we have four conditions:

1. 1000 + 100d2 + 10d3 + d4 ≡ 0 mod 7
2. 1000d1 + 100 + 10d3 + d4 ≡ 0 mod 7
3. 1000d1 + 100d2 + 10 + d4 ≡ 0 mod 7
4. 1000d1 + 100d2 + 10d3 + 1 ≡ 0 mod 7

Each of these must be congruent to 0 mod 7.

Let me compute each of these expressions modulo 7.

First, note that 1000 mod 7: 1000 /7 is 142*7=994, remainder 6, so 1000 ≡ 6 mod 7.

Similarly, 100 mod 7: 100 /7=14*7=98, so 100 ≡ 2 mod 7.

10 mod 7 is 3.

1 mod 7 is 1.

So let's rewrite each condition:

1. 6 + 2d2 + 3d3 + d4 ≡ 0 mod 7
2. 6d1 + 2 + 3d3 + d4 ≡ 0 mod 7
3. 6d1 + 2d2 + 3 + d4 ≡ 0 mod 7
4. 6d1 + 2d2 + 3d3 + 1 ≡ 0 mod 7

So these are four congruences.

Let me write them as:

(1) 2d2 + 3d3 + d4 ≡ -6 ≡ 1 mod 7

(2) 6d1 + 3d3 + d4 ≡ -2 ≡ 5 mod 7

(3) 6d1 + 2d2 + d4 ≡ -3 ≡ 4 mod 7

(4) 6d1 + 2d2 + 3d3 ≡ -1 ≡ 6 mod 7

Hmm, okay. So now I have four equations:

1. 2d2 + 3d3 + d4 ≡ 1 mod 7

2. 6d1 + 3d3 + d4 ≡ 5 mod 7

3. 6d1 + 2d2 + d4 ≡ 4 mod 7

4. 6d1 + 2d2 + 3d3 ≡ 6 mod 7

I need to solve these equations for digits d1, d2, d3, d4 (each from 0 to 9, except d1 which is from 1 to 9 since it's a four-digit number).

Since d1 is as large as possible (since we want the greatest number), perhaps starting with d1=9 and then trying to find d2, d3, d4 that satisfy all four conditions.

Alternatively, maybe I can express some variables in terms of others.

Let me see. Let's subtract equation (3) from equation (2):

Equation (2): 6d1 + 3d3 + d4 ≡5

Equation (3): 6d1 + 2d2 + d4 ≡4

Subtracting (3) from (2):

(6d1 -6d1) + (3d3 - 2d2) + (d4 -d4) ≡5-4

So, 3d3 - 2d2 ≡1 mod 7.

That's equation (5): 3d3 -2d2 ≡1 mod7.

Similarly, subtract equation (1) from equation (4):

Equation (4):6d1 +2d2 +3d3 ≡6

Equation (1): 2d2 +3d3 +d4 ≡1

Subtract (1) from (4):

6d1 +2d2 +3d3 - (2d2 +3d3 +d4) ≡6-1

Simplify:

6d1 -d4 ≡5 mod7.

So equation (6):6d1 -d4 ≡5 mod7.

So, equation (6) gives d4 ≡6d1 -5 mod7.

Similarly, equation (5):3d3 -2d2 ≡1 mod7.

Let me note that.

So, perhaps I can express d4 in terms of d1, and other variables in terms of others.

Also, equation (3):6d1 +2d2 +d4 ≡4 mod7.

But from equation (6), d4 = (6d1 -5) mod7.

So substitute d4 in equation (3):

6d1 +2d2 + (6d1 -5) ≡4 mod7

So, 6d1 +2d2 +6d1 -5 ≡4

12d1 +2d2 -5 ≡4 mod7.

12 mod7 is 5 (since 7*1=7, 12-7=5), so 12d1 ≡5d1.

Similarly, 2d2 remains as is.

So, 5d1 +2d2 -5 ≡4 mod7.

Which simplifies to:

5d1 +2d2 ≡9 mod7.

Since 9 mod7 is 2, so:

5d1 + 2d2 ≡2 mod7.

Let me note that as equation (7):5d1 +2d2 ≡2 mod7.

Similarly, equation (5):3d3 -2d2 ≡1 mod7.

So, perhaps I can express d3 in terms of d2.

From equation (5):3d3 ≡2d2 +1 mod7.

Multiply both sides by the inverse of 3 mod7. Since 3*5=15≡1 mod7, so inverse of 3 is 5.

Thus, d3 ≡5*(2d2 +1) mod7.

Which is d3 ≡10d2 +5 mod7.

10 mod7 is 3, so d3 ≡3d2 +5 mod7.

So, d3 ≡3d2 +5 mod7.

So, d3 is determined by d2 modulo7.

But since d3 is a digit (0-9), so d3 can be written as 7k + (3d2 +5 mod7) for some integer k such that d3 is between 0 and 9.

Similarly, equation (7):5d1 +2d2 ≡2 mod7.

I can write this as 2d2 ≡ (2 -5d1) mod7.

So, 2d2 ≡ (2 -5d1) mod7.

Again, since I have 2d2 ≡ something mod7, I can solve for d2.

Multiplying both sides by inverse of 2 mod7. Since 2*4=8≡1 mod7, inverse of 2 is 4.

Thus, d2 ≡4*(2 -5d1) mod7.

Which is d2 ≡ (8 -20d1) mod7.

Simplify:

8 mod7 is 1, and 20 mod7 is 6 (since 7*2=14, 20-14=6). So:

d2 ≡ (1 -6d1) mod7.

So, d2 ≡ (1 -6d1) mod7.

Therefore, d2 can be written as d2 =7m + (1 -6d1 mod7), where m is an integer such that d2 is between 0 and9.

Wait, actually, d2 is a digit (0-9), so for each d1, we can compute (1 -6d1) mod7, and then find possible d2.

But perhaps it's better to express d2 in terms of d1.

So, let's note:

d2 ≡ (1 -6d1) mod7.

Which is same as d2 ≡ (1 + ( -6d1 mod7 )) mod7.

But -6 mod7 is 1, since -6 +7=1.

So, -6d1 ≡d1 mod7.

Thus, d2 ≡(1 + d1) mod7.

So, d2 ≡(d1 +1) mod7.

Wait, let me check:

-6 ≡1 mod7, so -6d1 ≡d1 mod7.

So, 1 -6d1 ≡1 +d1 mod7.

So, yes, d2 ≡1 +d1 mod7.

Therefore, d2 = (d1 +1) mod7 +7k, where k is an integer such that d2 is between 0 and9.

Wait, but d2 is a digit (0-9), so for each d1, d2 can be either (d1 +1) mod7 or (d1 +1) mod7 +7, provided it's less than or equal to9.

So, for example, if (d1 +1) mod7 is s, then d2 can be s or s+7, as long as s+7 <=9.

Similarly, s can be from 0 to6.

So, for each d1, d2 can be in {s, s+7} where s=(d1+1) mod7, and s+7 <=9.

Given that d1 is from1 to9, let's see.

Let me tabulate d1 from9 down, trying to find d2, d3, d4.

Starting with d1=9:

d1=9.

Compute s=(9+1) mod7=10 mod7=3.

So s=3.

Thus, d2 can be 3 or 3+7=10. But d2 must be <=9, so d2 can be 3 or10, but 10 is invalid. So d2=3.

So, d2=3.

Then, from equation (5): d3 ≡3d2 +5 mod7.

d2=3, so 3*3=9, 9+5=14. 14 mod7=0.

So d3 ≡0 mod7.

Since d3 is a digit, d3 can be 0 or7.

So, d3=0 or7.

Now, from equation (6): d4 ≡6d1 -5 mod7.

d1=9, so 6*9=54, 54-5=49. 49 mod7=0.

So, d4 ≡0 mod7.

Thus, d4 can be 0 or7.

So, d4=0 or7.

So, for d1=9, d2=3, d3=0 or7, d4=0 or7.

Now, we need to check if any of these combinations satisfy all four equations.

Wait, but perhaps it's better to construct D as 9 3 d3 d4, where d3 and d4 are 0 or7.

But we need to ensure that when any digit is replaced by1, the number is divisible by7.

So, let's try D=9300.

Check each condition:

1. Replace d1 with1: 1300. 1300/7=185.714... Not an integer. So 1300 is not divisible by7.

Wait, but according to our earlier equations, it should satisfy the conditions.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the congruences.

Wait, let me check.

Wait, if D=9300:

Change d1 to1:1300.

1300 divided by7: 7*185=1295, 1300-1295=5. So remainder5, not divisible by7.

Hmm, that's a problem. So our equations must be correct, but perhaps D=9300 doesn't satisfy all the conditions.

Wait, but according to our earlier reasoning, it should. So maybe I made a mistake in the setup.

Alternatively, perhaps I need to check all four numbers.

Wait, let's take D=9300.

Check each modified number:

1. 1300: 1300 mod7=5, not 0.

So, already fails condition1. So D=9300 is invalid.

Hmm, so something is wrong. Maybe I need to check more carefully.

Wait, perhaps I need to check all four conditions for each possible D.

Wait, but for D=9300, when we change d1, d2, d3, d4 to1, we get:

1300, 9100, 9310, 9301.

We need all four to be divisible by7.

Let me compute each:

1. 1300: 1300 ÷7=185.714... Remainder5. Not divisible.

So, D=9300 is invalid.

So, perhaps I need to try next possible d3 and d4.

Wait, for d3, we had 0 or7. Similarly, d4=0 or7.

So, possible combinations:

d3=0, d4=0: D=9300, which we saw fails.

d3=0, d4=7: D=9307.

Check:

1. 1307: 1307 ÷7=186.714... 7*186=1302, remainder5. Not divisible.

So, fails.

d3=7, d4=0: D=9370.

Check:

1. 1370: 1370 ÷7=195.714... 7*195=1365, remainder5. Not divisible.

Fails.

d3=7, d4=7: D=9377.

Check:

1. 1377: 1377 ÷7=196.714... 7*196=1372, remainder5. Not divisible.

Hmm, all possibilities with d1=9, d2=3 fail.

So, perhaps d1=9 is not possible. Let's try d1=8.

Wait, but wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the equations.

Wait, when d1=9, d2=3.

But when we set d2=3, d3=0 or7, d4=0 or7.

But the resulting numbers don't satisfy the conditions. So maybe I need to check higher k for d2.

Wait, earlier I said d2=3 or10, but 10 is invalid. So only d2=3.

So, perhaps d1=9 is not possible, and we need to try d1=8.

So, let's try d1=8.

Compute s=(8+1) mod7=9 mod7=2.

So, s=2.

Thus, d2=2 or2+7=9.

So, d2 can be 2 or9.

So, two possibilities: d2=2 or9.

First, let's try d2=9.

Then, d3 ≡3d2 +5 mod7.

d2=9, which is 2 mod7 (since 9-7=2).

So, 3*2 +5=6+5=11≡4 mod7.

Thus, d3≡4 mod7.

So, d3 can be4 or11, but 11 is invalid. So d3=4.

Then, d4≡6d1 -5 mod7.

d1=8, so 6*8=48, 48-5=43. 43 mod7: 7*6=42, remainder1. So d4≡1 mod7.

Thus, d4=1 or8.

So, possible D=8 9 4 1 or 8 9 4 8.

Check D=8941.

Check all four modified numbers:

1. 1941: 1941 ÷7=277.285... 7*277=1939, remainder2. Not divisible.

So, fails.

Next, D=8948.

Check:

1. 1948: 1948 ÷7=278.285... 7*278=1946, remainder2. Not divisible.

Fails.

So, d2=9 doesn't work. Try d2=2.

d2=2.

Then, d3≡3d2 +5 mod7=3*2 +5=11≡4 mod7.

So, d3=4 or11, but 11 invalid. So d3=4.

Then, d4≡6d1 -5 mod7=6*8-5=48-5=43≡1 mod7. So d4=1 or8.

So, D=8 2 4 1 or8 2 4 8.

Check D=8241.

Check all four modified numbers:

1. 1241: 1241 ÷7=177.285... 7*177=1239, remainder2. Not divisible.

Fails.

D=8248.

Check:

1. 1248: 1248 ÷7=178.285... 7*178=1246, remainder2. Not divisible.

Fails.

Hmm, so d1=8 also doesn't work. Let's try d1=7.

d1=7.

Compute s=(7+1) mod7=8 mod7=1.

So, s=1.

Thus, d2=1 or8.

First, d2=1.

Then, d3≡3d2 +5 mod7=3*1 +5=8≡1 mod7.

So, d3=1 or8.

Then, d4≡6d1 -5 mod7=6*7 -5=42-5=37≡2 mod7.

So, d4=2 or9.

Thus, possible D=7 1 1 2, 7 1 1 9, 7 1 8 2, 7 1 8 9.

Check D=7112.

Check each modified number:

1. 1112: 1112 ÷7=158.857... 7*158=1106, remainder6. Not divisible.

Fails.

D=7119.

1. 1119: 1119 ÷7=159.857... 7*159=1113, remainder6. Not divisible.

Fails.

D=7182.

Check:

1. 1182: 1182 ÷7=168.857... 7*168=1176, remainder6. Not divisible.

Fails.

D=7189.

Check:

1. 1189: 1189 ÷7=169.857... 7*169=1183, remainder6. Not divisible.

Fails.

Now, try d2=8.

d2=8.

Then, d3≡3d2 +5 mod7.

d2=8≡1 mod7, so 3*1 +5=8≡1 mod7.

So, d3=1 or8.

Then, d4≡6d1 -5 mod7=6*7 -5=42-5=37≡2 mod7. So d4=2 or9.

Thus, D=7 8 1 2,7 8 1 9,7 8 8 2,7 8 8 9.

Check D=7812.

1. 1812: 1812 ÷7=258.857... 7*258=1806, remainder6. Not divisible.

Fails.

D=7819.

1. 1819: 1819 ÷7=259.857... 7*259=1813, remainder6. Not divisible.

Fails.

D=7882.

1. 1882: 1882 ÷7=268.857... 7*268=1876, remainder6. Not divisible.

Fails.

D=7889.

1. 1889: 1889 ÷7=269.857... 7*269=1883, remainder6. Not divisible.

Fails.

So, d1=7 doesn't work.

Proceeding to d1=6.

d1=6.

s=(6+1) mod7=7 mod7=0.

So, s=0.

Thus, d2=0 or7.

First, d2=0.

Then, d3≡3d2 +5 mod7=3*0 +5=5 mod7.

So, d3=5 or12 (invalid). So d3=5.

Then, d4≡6d1 -5 mod7=6*6 -5=36-5=31≡3 mod7.

So, d4=3 or10 (invalid). So d4=3.

Thus, D=6 0 5 3.

Check:

1. 1053: 1053 ÷7=150.428... 7*150=1050, remainder3. Not divisible.

Fails.

Next, try d2=7.

d2=7.

Then, d3≡3d2 +5 mod7=3*7 +5=21+5=26≡5 mod7.

So, d3=5 or12 (invalid). So d3=5.

d4≡6d1 -5 mod7=6*6 -5=31≡3 mod7. So d4=3 or10 (invalid). So d4=3.

Thus, D=6 7 5 3.

Check:

1. 1753: 1753 ÷7=250.428... 7*250=1750, remainder3. Not divisible.

Fails.

So, d1=6 doesn't work.

Moving on to d1=5.

d1=5.

s=(5+1) mod7=6 mod7=6.

So, d2=6 or13 (invalid). So d2=6.

Then, d3≡3d2 +5 mod7=3*6 +5=18+5=23≡2 mod7.

So, d3=2 or9.

Then, d4≡6d1 -5 mod7=6*5 -5=30-5=25≡4 mod7.

So, d4=4 or11 (invalid). So d4=4.

Thus, D=5 6 2 4 or5 6 9 4.

Check D=5624.

1. 1624: 1624 ÷7=232. 7*232=1624. Exactly divisible. Good.

2. 5124: 5124 ÷7=732. 7*732=5124. Divisible.

3. 5614: 5614 ÷7=802. 7*802=5614. Divisible.

4. 5621: 5621 ÷7=803. 7*803=5621. Divisible.

Wait, all four numbers are divisible by7.

So, D=5624 is a valid number.

But wait, are there larger numbers with d1=5? Because we're looking for the greatest four-digit number.

Wait, let's check if d3=9 works.

D=5694.

Check:

1. 1694: 1694 ÷7=242. 7*242=1694. Divisible.

2. 5194: 5194 ÷7=742. 7*742=5194. Divisible.

3. 5694: Wait, no, the third condition is replacing d3 with1: 5614. Which we already checked.

Wait, no, let me recheck.

Wait, D=5694.

1. Replace d1 with1:1694, which is 1694 ÷7=242. So yes.

2. Replace d2 with1:5194 ÷7=742. So yes.

3. Replace d3 with1:5614 ÷7=802. So yes.

4. Replace d4 with1:5691 ÷7=813. 7*813=5691. Divisible.

So, D=5694 is also valid.

Now, since we're looking for the greatest four-digit number, between 5694 and 5624, 5694 is larger.

So, D=5694 is a candidate.

But wait, perhaps there are larger numbers with d1=5 and d2=6, d3=9, d4=4.

But wait, is 5694 the maximum? Let's see.

Wait, perhaps with d1=5, can we have higher d2, d3, d4.

Wait, d2 was fixed at6 because s=6, so d2=6 or13 invalid.

So, d2=6 is fixed.

Then, d3=2 or9, and d4=4.

Thus, the maximum D with d1=5 would be 5694.

But wait, perhaps there are higher d1.

Wait, we tried d1=9,8,7,6,5. Maybe d1=5 is the highest possible.

Wait, no, perhaps not. Let's see.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let's go back.

Wait, when d1=9, d2=3, but the resulting D didn't satisfy the condition. So maybe I need to try d1=9 again, but perhaps with different d3 and d4.

Wait, earlier when d1=9, d2=3, d3=0 or7, d4=0 or7.

But all four combinations didn't work. So perhaps d1=9 is impossible.

Similarly, d1=8 didn't work, d1=7 didn't work, d1=6 didn't work, but d1=5 worked with D=5694.

But wait, perhaps I missed something.

Wait, when d1=5, we found D=5694.

But wait, let's check if there's a higher D with d1=5.

Wait, D=5694 is 5 6 9 4.

Is there a higher D with d1=5, d2=6, d3=9, d4=4? That's the maximum for d3=9 and d4=4.

Wait, but perhaps I can have d4=11, but no, digits can't be more than9.

So, 5694 is the highest with d1=5.

But wait, perhaps I can have a higher d1.

Wait, d1=6 didn't work, but maybe I need to try d1=6 again with different d2.

Wait, when d1=6, s=0, so d2=0 or7.

We tried d2=0 and d2=7, but the resulting D didn't satisfy all conditions.

Wait, perhaps I need to try d1=6 again.

Wait, when d1=6, d2=0.

Then, d3=5, d4=3.

D=6053.

Check:

1. 1053 ÷7=150.428... No.

So, invalid.

d2=7, d3=5, d4=3: D=6753.

Check:

1. 1753 ÷7=250.428... No.

Invalid.

So, d1=6 doesn't work.

Thus, the next possible is d1=5, which gives D=5694.

Wait, but let's check if there's a higher D with d1=5 and higher digits.

Wait, 5694 is 5 6 9 4.

If I can have d3=9, d4=4, that's the maximum. So, 5694 is the maximum for d1=5.

But wait, let's check if there's a higher D with d1=5 and d2=6, d3=9, d4=4. That's the maximum possible.

Alternatively, perhaps there's a higher D with d1=5, d2=6, d3=9, d4=4.

Wait, that's 5694.

But wait, is there a higher D with d1=5, d2=6, d3=9, d4=4? Or perhaps d4=11, which is invalid.

So, 5694 is the highest with d1=5.

But wait, perhaps there's a higher D with d1=5, d2=6, d3=9, d4=4.

Wait, that's the highest possible for d1=5.

But wait, let me check d1=5, d2=6, d3=9, d4=4.

Yes, that's 5694.

But wait, perhaps I can have d4=11, but that's invalid.

So, 5694 is the highest.

But wait, wait a minute. When I tried d1=5, I found D=5694, but when I tried d1=6, I didn't find any valid D, same with d1=7,8,9.

So, is 5694 the answer?

Wait, but let me check if there's a higher D with d1=5, d2=6, d3=9, d4=4. That's 5694.

But wait, let me think again.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the earlier steps. Let's try d1=5 again.

Wait, when d1=5, d2=6, d3=9, d4=4.

So, D=5694.

Check all four conditions:

1. Replace d1 with1:1694. 1694 ÷7=242. So yes.

2. Replace d2 with1:5194. 5194 ÷7=742. So yes.

3. Replace d3 with1:5614. 5614 ÷7=802. So yes.

4. Replace d4 with1:5691. 5691 ÷7=813. So yes.

All four numbers are divisible by7. So D=5694 is valid.

But wait, is there a higher D?

Wait, perhaps with d1=5, d2=6, d3=9, d4=4 is the highest.

But wait, let me think. What if d4=4, can I have a higher d4?

No, because d4=4 is fixed by equation (6).

Wait, d4≡6d1 -5 mod7=6*5 -5=30-5=25≡4 mod7.

So, d4=4 or11, but 11 is invalid.

Thus, d4=4 is fixed.

Similarly, d3=9 is the maximum possible for d3≡2 mod7.

Wait, no, d3=2 or9. So 9 is the maximum.

Thus, D=5694 is the highest possible for d1=5.

But wait, let's check d1=5, d2=6, d3=9, d4=4.

Yes, that's 5694.

But wait, perhaps I can try another approach.

Wait, perhaps I can consider that N is the number, and when any digit is replaced by1, it's divisible by7.

So, let's consider N as abcd.

Then, replacing a with1:1bcd must be divisible by7.

Similarly, replacing b with1:a1cd must be divisible by7.

And so on.

So, for N=5694:

1. 1694 ÷7=242. Correct.

2. 5194 ÷7=742. Correct.

3. 5614 ÷7=802. Correct.

4. 5691 ÷7=813. Correct.

So, yes, N=5694 is valid.

But wait, is there a higher N?

Wait, perhaps I can try N=5694+7=5701.

Wait, but 5701 is higher than5694. Let's check if it satisfies the conditions.

Wait, but I don't know if it does. Let's check:

Replace a with1:1701.

1701 ÷7=243. So yes.

Replace b with1:5101. 5101 ÷7=728.714... No, remainder5. So, invalid.

Thus, N=5701 doesn't satisfy all conditions.

So, 5694 is the highest.

Wait, but wait, perhaps I can find a higher N.

Wait, let's think differently. Since N=5694 is valid, but perhaps there's a higher N with d1=5, d2=6, d3=9, d4=4.

Wait, that's the highest possible.

Alternatively, perhaps I can find a higher N with d1=5, d2=6, d3=9, d4=4.

Wait, but that's the maximum.

Thus, the answer is N=5694.

But wait, let me check N=5694.

Wait, when we replace d4 with1, we get5691, which is divisible by7.

Yes, because 5691 ÷7=813.

Yes.

So, N=5694.

Now, the question asks for Q and R when N is divided by1000.

So, N=5694.

Divide by1000: Q=5, R=694.

Thus, Q+R=5+694=699.

Wait, but let's check.

Wait, 5694 ÷1000=5 with remainder694.

Yes.

So, Q=5, R=694.

Thus, Q+R=5+694=699.

So, the answer is699.

To solve the problem, we need to find the greatest four-digit number \( N \) such that changing any one of its digits to 1 results in a number divisible by 7. We then find \( Q + R \) where \( Q \) is the quotient and \( R \) is the remainder when \( N \) is divided by 1000.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Understanding the Problem**:
   - \( N \) is a four-digit number \( d_1d_2d_3d_4 \).
   - Changing any digit \( d_i \) to 1 results in a number divisible by 7.
   - We need to find the largest such \( N \) and compute \( Q + R \) when \( N \) is divided by 1000.

2. **Setting Up Congruences**:
   - Denote \( N = 1000d_1 + 100d_2 + 10d_3 + d_4 \).
   - For each digit \( d_i \), replacing it with 1 yields a number divisible by 7. This gives four congruences modulo 7:
     1. \( 1000 + 100d_2 + 10d_3 + d_4 \equiv 0 \mod 7 \)
     2. \( 1000d_1 + 100 + 10d_3 + d_4 \equiv 0 \mod 7 \)
     3. \( 1000d_1 + 100d_2 + 10 + d_4 \equiv 0 \mod 7 \)
     4. \( 1000d_1 + 100d_2 + 10d_3 + 1 \equiv 0 \mod 7 \)

3. **Simplifying the Congruences**:
   - Using modulo 7:
     - \( 1000 \equiv 6 \mod 7 \)
     - \( 100 \equiv 2 \mod 7 \)
     - \( 10 \equiv 3 \mod 7 \)
     - \( 1 \equiv 1 \mod 7 \)
   - Rewriting the congruences:
     1. \( 6 + 2d_2 + 3d_3 + d_4 \equiv 0 \mod 7 \)
     2. \( 6d_1 + 2 + 3d_3 + d_4 \equiv 0 \mod 7 \)
     3. \( 6d_1 + 2d_2 + 3 + d_4 \equiv 0 \mod 7 \)
     4. \( 6d_1 + 2d_2 + 3d_3 + 1 \equiv 0 \mod 7 \)

4. **Solving the System of Congruences**:
   - Subtracting equations to eliminate variables:
     - From equations (2) and (3): \( 3d_3 - 2d_2 \equiv 1 \mod 7 \)
     - From equations (1) and (4): \( 6d_1 - d_4 \equiv 5 \mod 7 \)
   - Expressing variables in terms of others:
     - \( d_2 \equiv (1 - 6d_1) \mod 7 \)
     - \( d_3 \equiv 3d_2 + 5 \mod 7 \)
     - \( d_4 \equiv 6d_1 - 5 \mod 7 \)

5. **Testing Possible Values**:
   - Start with the largest possible \( d_1 = 9 \) and work downwards.
   - For \( d_1 = 5 \), the system yields \( d_2 = 6 \), \( d_3 = 9 \), and \( d_4 = 4 \), giving \( N = 5694 \).

6. **Verifying \( N = 5694 \)**:
   - Replace each digit with 1 and check divisibility by 7:
     1. \( 1694 \div 7 = 242 \) (exact)
     2. \( 5194 \div 7 = 742 \) (exact)
     3. \( 5614 \div 7 = 802 \) (exact)
     4. \( 5691 \div 7 = 813 \) (exact)
   - All conditions are satisfied.

7. **Calculating \( Q + R \)**:
   - \( N = 5694 \)
   - Dividing by 1000: \( Q = 5 \), \( R = 694 \)
   - \( Q + R = 5 + 694 = 699 \)

### Final Answer:
\boxed{699}
