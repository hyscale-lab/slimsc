Okay, so I have this math problem where I need to find the sum of the squares of a list of positive integers. The list has some specific properties: the sum is 30, the unique mode is 9, and the median is a positive integer that doesn't appear in the list. Hmm, let me break this down step by step.

First, let me recall what each term means. The mode is the number that appears most frequently in the list, and it's unique, so no other number can appear as many times as 9. The median is the middle number when the list is ordered from smallest to largest. Since the median doesn't appear in the list, that means when the list is ordered, the middle value is not one of the numbers we have. Interesting.

So, the sum is 30, which is a key constraint. Let me think about how the numbers are arranged. Let's denote the list as a sorted list, so it's in non-decreasing order. Let's say the list has n elements. The median would be the average of the two middle numbers if n is even, or the middle number if n is odd. But since the median isn't in the list, that suggests that if n is odd, the median is the middle number, but it doesn't appear. Wait, but if it's the middle number and not in the list, that's confusing. So perhaps n is even? Because then the median would be the average of two middle numbers, which might not be in the list. Yeah, that makes sense.

Wait, but the median has to be a positive integer. So, for example, if the two middle numbers are 8 and 10, the median would be 9. Oh! That's interesting because 9 is the mode. So in that case, the median is 9, which is the mode, but it doesn't appear in the list. Hmm, but 9 is the mode, meaning it appears more than any other number. So if 9 is the mode but doesn't appear in the list, that's a contradiction because the mode has to be present in the list. So wait, that can't be. So perhaps my initial thought process is wrong.

Wait, maybe the median is not 9. Let me think again. The median is a positive integer that doesn't appear in the list, and the unique mode is 9. So maybe the two middle numbers are such that their average is some other integer that's not in the list. Let's try to model this.

Let me consider the possible lengths of the list. The sum is 30, so the number of elements can't be too large. Let's consider n being even or odd.

If n is odd, then the median is the middle element. But the problem says the median doesn't appear in the list, which is impossible because the median is one of the elements if n is odd. So n must be even. Therefore, the list has an even number of elements, and the median is the average of the two middle numbers. So the median is (a_{k} + a_{k+1}) / 2, where k is n/2. Since it's an integer, (a_k + a_{k+1}) must be even, so their sum is even.

So, the median is an integer, but it doesn't appear in the list. So, for example, if the two middle numbers are 8 and 10, the median is 9, which is not in the list. So 9 is the mode, which is fine because the mode is 9, but the median is 9, which isn't in the list. Hmm, but wait, if the mode is 9, 9 must appear more times than any other number. So if 9 is the mode, but it's not present in the list, that can't be. Wait, this is a contradiction.

Wait, so the median is 9, which is an integer, and it's the mode. But the problem says the median is a positive integer that does not appear in the list. So the mode is 9, but 9 isn't in the list? That's impossible because mode is the most frequent value, so it must appear in the list. Therefore, perhaps my initial assumption is wrong. Maybe the median is not 9, but some other integer. Let me think again.

Wait, no. The median must be an integer, but it's not in the list. The mode is 9, which is in the list. So perhaps the median is a different integer, say m, which is not in the list. How is that possible?

Let me try an example. Suppose the list is [1, 2, 3, 4]. The median is (2 + 3)/2 = 2.5, which is not an integer, so that doesn't fit. Another example: [1, 3, 4, 5]. The median is (3 + 4)/2 = 3.5, not integer. Hmm.

But we need the median to be an integer and not in the list. So the two middle numbers must add up to an even number, and their average is not present in the list. So for example, if the two middle numbers are 8 and 10, the median is 9, which is not in the list. So that works. But in that case, 9 is the mode. So the list would have several 9s, but if 9 isn't in the list, that's a problem because mode must be present. So this is a contradiction.

Wait, so maybe the mode is 9, but it appears more times than any other number, so it must appear in the list multiple times. But the median is an integer not in the list. So how?

Alternatively, maybe the two middle numbers are both 9. Then the median would be 9, but since 9 is in the list, that's not allowed because the median must not appear in the list. So that's not possible.

Wait, maybe the two middle numbers are different, and their average is an integer not equal to 9. Hmm, but then the mode is 9, which is in the list. Let me think.

Let me try to think about the structure of the list. Since the mode is 9, 9 must appear more frequently than any other number. So the number of 9s must be greater than the count of any other number. So, suppose the list has k instances of 9. Then, all other numbers can appear at most k-1 times.

The sum is 30, so the sum contributed by the 9s is 9 * k. The remaining sum is 30 - 9k, which must be distributed among the other numbers.

The list is sorted, and the median is an integer not in the list. Let's consider the length of the list, n.

Since the median is an integer, and it's the average of a_k and a_{k+1}, which are the two middle numbers. So (a_k + a_{k+1}) must be even, and the median m is (a_k + a_{k+1}) / 2, which is not in the list.

Also, the list must have more 9s than any other number. So, let's suppose n is even, so n = 2k, and the median is the average of the k-th and (k+1)-th elements.

Since the median is m, which is not in the list, m must be an integer. So m = (a_k + a_{k+1}) / 2.

But in our case, the mode is 9, so 9 must appear more times than any other number. So, if 9 is in the list, but the median is not 9, perhaps the two middle numbers are such that their average is m, which is not 9.

Wait, but if the two middle numbers are both 9, then the median is 9, which is in the list, which is not allowed. So to have the median as m ≠9, the two middle numbers must not be both 9. So, one of them is less than 9, and the other is greater than 9, or both are the same but not 9.

Wait, but if the two middle numbers are the same, say x, then the median is x, which would be in the list, which is not allowed. So, the two middle numbers must be different, and their average is m, which is not in the list.

So, the two middle numbers, a_k and a_{k+1}, must satisfy a_k < m < a_{k+1}, and m is an integer. So, a_k and a_{k+1} must be such that (a_k + a_{k+1}) is 2m, and m is not present in the list.

Now, since the mode is 9, and it's unique, the count of 9s is higher than any other number.

Let me try to construct such a list. Let me consider possible values for n. Let's see:

If n is 6, then the median is (a_3 + a_4)/2. Let's try to have the median as 8, which is not in the list. So a_3 + a_4 = 16. Let's say a_3 =7 and a_4=9. Then the median is 8, which is not in the list. But then, we have a 9 in the list, which is okay because the mode is 9. Now, how many 9s do we have? Let's see.

Let me try to make a list of 6 numbers where 9 is the mode.

Wait, but let's think about the counts. Suppose we have multiple 9s. Let's say 9 appears 3 times. Then, the other numbers can appear at most 2 times.

So, n=6, 3 9s, and the sum contributed by 9s is 27. The remaining sum is 3, to be distributed among the other 3 numbers. But each of these can be at most 2, so we can have, for example, three 1s. So the list would be [1,1,1,9,9,9]. But let's see the median. The sorted list is [1,1,1,9,9,9]. The median is (1 +9)/2 =5, which is not in the list. Wait, no, that's not correct because the two middle numbers are 1 and 9, so median is 5, which is not in the list. So that satisfies the median condition. But wait, the mode is 9, which appears 3 times, and the others appear once or three times. Wait, in this case, 1 appears three times as well. Oh no, that's a problem because the mode is supposed to be unique. So 1 appears three times and 9 appears three times. So that's bimodal, which contradicts the unique mode condition.

So I need to adjust that. Let me try making 9 appear four times. So sum from 9s is 36, but wait, the total sum is 30, so that's too much. So 3 9s would require the rest to sum to 3, which is possible, but as above, that causes another number to appear three times, conflicting with the unique mode.

So maybe n is larger. Let's try n=8. Then the median is the average of a_4 and a_5. Let's say the median is 8, so a_4 + a_5 =16. Let's say a_4=7 and a_5=9. Then the list has 7,9 as the two middle numbers. So the median is 8, which is not in the list.

Now, let's have 9 as the mode. So we need more 9s than any other number. Let's say 9 appears 3 times. Then the other numbers can appear at most 2 times.

Total sum from 9s: 9*3=27. Remaining sum:30-27=3. The remaining 5 numbers (since n=8, and 3 are 9s) need to sum to 3. So, possible numbers: maybe five 1s? Wait, 5 numbers summing to 3. So, three 1s and two 0s? But the numbers must be positive integers. So the smallest possible is 1.

Wait, but 5 numbers summing to 3 with each at least 1: that's impossible because 5*1=5>3. So that doesn't work. So maybe 9 appears twice. Then sum from 9s is 18, remaining sum is 12. The remaining 6 numbers sum to 12. Let's see: 6 numbers, sum 12, all positive integers. The maximum any can be is 2 (since 9 appears twice). Wait, no, other numbers can appear up to 1 time because mode is 9 which appears twice. So each other number can appear at most once. Wait, no, 9 is the mode, so any other number can appear at most once less than 9's count. If 9 appears twice, others can appear once. So, the remaining 6 numbers can be six 2s? No, wait, sum is 12 over 6 numbers: each is 2. But 2 appears 6 times, which is more than 9's two times. That would make 2 the mode, which is a problem because 9 is the unique mode.

So that doesn't work. Hmm, maybe 9 appears three times, but then the remaining sum is 3, which as above, is not possible because we can't have 5 numbers sum to 3 with all ≥1.

Wait, maybe n is 5. Let's see, n=5 is odd, but earlier I thought that's impossible because the median would have to be in the list. But wait, the problem says the median is a positive integer that does not appear in the list. So n=5 is possible? Let me think. For n=5, the median is the 3rd element. If the median is m, which is not in the list, but the 3rd element is part of the list. So that can't happen. So n can't be odd. So n must be even, like 6,8,10, etc.

Wait, let's try n=6 again. Let's try to have 9 appear three times. So sum from 9s is 27, remaining sum is 3. The other three numbers must sum to 3, each being at least 1. So, we can have three 1s. So the list would be [1,1,1,9,9,9]. Wait, but as before, the 1s appear three times, same as 9s. So that's bimodal. To avoid that, maybe have 9 appear four times. But 4*9=36>30, which is too much. So that's not possible.

Alternatively, maybe have 9 appear three times, and the other three numbers as 1,1,1, but then 1 appears three times as well. So that's a problem.

Alternatively, maybe have the other three numbers sum to 3 with different numbers. For example, one 1, one 2, and one 0. But 0 is not allowed since all numbers are positive. So that's not possible. So n=6 with 9 appearing three times doesn't work.

What if 9 appears two times. Then sum from 9s is 18. Remaining sum is 12, spread over four numbers. Let's see, four numbers summing to 12, each at least 1. Let's say 3,3,3,3. But then 3 appears four times, which is more than 9's two times. Not good. Alternatively, 2,2,2,6: but 2 appears three times, which is more than 9's two. Or 1,1,1,9: but 1 appears three times, same as 9. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe 1,2,3,6: sum is 12, but each appears once. So the list would be [1,2,3,6,9,9]. Let's sort it: [1,2,3,6,9,9]. Median is (3+6)/2=4.5, which is not an integer. So that doesn't satisfy the median condition. We need the median to be an integer.

So, to get an integer median, the two middle numbers must add to an even number. So, in n=6, a_3 + a_4 must be even. In the above list, a_3=3 and a_4=6, sum is 9, which is odd. So median is 4.5, which is not integer.

So, let's adjust. Maybe have a_3=4 and a_4=4, but then the median is 4, which is in the list, which is not allowed. So, perhaps a_3=3 and a_4=5, sum is 8, median is 4. So the list would be [1,2,3,5,9,9]. Sum is 1+2+3+5+9+9=29, which is less than 30. So we need one more. Maybe add a 1 somewhere. So the list becomes [1,1,2,3,5,9,9]. Wait, n=7, which is odd, and the median would be the 4th element, which is 3, but that's in the list, which is not allowed. So that's not good.

Wait, maybe I need to have n=8. Let's try n=8. Let's have 9 appear three times. Sum from 9s is 27, remaining sum is 3, over five numbers. Five numbers summing to 3, each at least 1: that's 1,1,1,0,0, but 0 is not allowed. So that doesn't work. So maybe 9 appears twice. Sum from 9s is 18, remaining sum is 12, over six numbers. Each can be at least 1, sum 12. Let me see: if I have six numbers summing to 12, possible as 2,2,2,2,2,2. But then 2 appears six times, which is more than 9's two. Not good. Alternatively, 3,3,3,3,0,0: but again 0 is not allowed.

Alternatively, 1,1,1,1,1,6: sum is 11, not 12. Or 1,1,1,1,2,6: sum is 12. So list would be [1,1,1,1,2,6,9,9]. Let's sort it: [1,1,1,1,2,6,9,9]. The two middle numbers are 1 and 2, wait no, n=8, a_4 and a_5 are the middle. Wait, n=8, indices 1-8. Middle indices are 4 and 5. So a_4=1 and a_5=2. So median is (1+2)/2=1.5, which is not integer. Not good.

Alternatively, adjust the numbers so that a_4 and a_5 add to even. Let's have a_4=2 and a_5=2. Then the median is 2, which is in the list. Not allowed. So maybe a_4=1 and a_5=3. Then median is 2, which is not in the list. Let's try that.

So, list would be [1,1,1,1,3, something,9,9]. Wait, the sum needs to be 30. Let's calculate:

We have two 9s: 18. The rest: six numbers summing to 12. Let me arrange them as [1,1,1,1,3,3,9,9]. Sum is 1+1+1+1+3+3+9+9= 28. Need 2 more. So maybe add a 2 somewhere. So [1,1,1,1,2,3,9,9]. Sum is 1+1+1+1+2+3+9+9=27. Still need 3 more. Hmm, maybe this approach isn't working.

Wait, maybe the two middle numbers are 3 and 5. Then median is 4, which is not in the list. Let's try that.

So, for n=8, the list would have a_4=3 and a_5=5. So the list would be something like [x, x, x, 3,5, x, x,9,9]. Wait, no, n=8, so the list is [a,b,c,3,5,d,e,9]. Wait, but the two 9s are at the end. So the list would be [a,b,c,3,5,d,e,9]. Wait, but need two 9s, so maybe [a,b,c,3,5,d,e,9,9], but that's n=9, which is odd. So no, for n=8, the list is [a,b,c,3,5,d,e,9]. Wait, but we need two 9s, so perhaps the last two numbers are 9. So the list is [a,b,c,3,5,d,9,9]. Now, the sum is 30. Let's calculate the sum contributed by known numbers: 3+5=8, 9+9=18. So remaining numbers a,b,c,d sum to 30 -8-18=4. So a+b+c+d=4. Each of these is at least 1, so possible combinations:

We can have 1,1,1,1: sum=4. So the list would be [1,1,1,3,5,1,9,9]. Wait, but then we have 1 appearing four times, which is more than 9's two times. So 1 becomes the mode, which contradicts the unique mode being 9.

Alternatively, maybe have a=1, b=1, c=1, d=1. Same problem.

Alternatively, maybe a=1, b=1, c=1, d=1. As above, same issue.

Alternatively, a=1, b=1, c=1, d=1. No, same problem.

Hmm, maybe 9 appears three times. Then sum from 9s is 27, leaving 3 to be distributed among five numbers. Each at least 1: 1,1,1,0,0. But 0 is invalid. So that's not possible.

Alternatively, perhaps n=10. Let's see. For n=10, the median is the average of a_5 and a_6. Let's say the median is 8, so a_5 + a_6 =16. Let's set a_5=7 and a_6=9. Then the median is 8, which is not in the list.

Now, 9 needs to be the mode. Let's have 9 appear three times. Sum from 9s is 27. Remaining sum is 3, spread over seven numbers. Each must be at least 1, so 1,1,1,0,0,0,0: but zeros are invalid. So that doesn't work. So 9 must appear at least four times. 4*9=36>30, which is too much.

Alternatively, 9 appears three times, remaining sum is 30-27=3, over seven numbers. Each at least 1, total 7. But 3 is less than 7, so impossible. So n=10 is not working.

Wait, maybe n=4. Let's try n=4. Then, the median is the average of a_2 and a_3. Let's say the median is 8, so a_2 +a_3=16. Let's set a_2=7 and a_3=9. Then the list is [x,7,9,y]. The sum is x +7 +9 + y=30 => x+y=14. Now, 9 is the unique mode, so it must appear more than any other number. Currently, 9 appears once. So to make it the mode, we need to have 9 appear at least twice. So let's set y=9, so sum x +9=14 => x=5. So the list would be [5,7,9,9]. Now, check the mode: 9 appears twice, others once. So mode is 9, which is good.

Median is (7+9)/2=8, which is not in the list. That's perfect. So this list works.

Wait, let's check the sum:5+7+9+9=30. Yes, that's correct. The mode is 9, which appears twice, others once. So unique mode. The median is 8, which is not in the list. Perfect.

So the list is [5,7,9,9]. Now, the sum of squares is 5² +7² +9² +9²=25+49+81+81= 25+49=74, 74+81=155, 155+81=236.

Wait, but let me think if there's another possible list. For example, if the median is 8, and the list is [5,7,9,9], that works. Alternatively, maybe another list.

Wait, another possibility: let's say the two middle numbers are 8 and 8, so median is 8, but then 8 is in the list, which is not allowed. So that's not possible. So the previous list is the only option for n=4.

Alternatively, maybe n=6, but earlier attempts didn't work. Let me see again.

Wait, for n=6, let's try to have 9 appear three times. Sum from 9s is 27, remaining sum is 3, over three numbers. So three 1s. So list is [1,1,1,9,9,9]. But as before, 1 appears three times, same as 9, which is bimodal. So that's not allowed.

Alternatively, have 9 appear four times. Sum is 36>30, no good.

Alternatively, have 9 appear three times, and the other three numbers sum to 3 with one of them being 3 and the rest 0, but zeros are invalid. So that doesn't work.

So the only viable option is n=4 with the list [5,7,9,9]. Sum of squares is 25 +49 +81 +81=236.

Wait, but let me check if there's another list with a different median. For example, if the median is 7, which is in the list, so that's invalid. If the median is 6, which is not in the list, how?

Let me try that. Suppose the median is 6, which is not in the list. For n=4, the two middle numbers must add to 12. So a_2 +a_3=12. Let me choose a_2=5 and a_3=7. Then the list is [x,5,7,y]. Sum is x+5+7+y=30 =>x+y=18. To have 9 as the mode, it needs to appear more than any other number. So 9 must appear at least twice. Let's set y=9, then x=9. So the list is [9,5,7,9]. Sorted: [5,7,9,9]. Which is the same as before. So same sum of squares.

Alternatively, maybe a_2=4 and a_3=8. Then the list is [x,4,8,y]. Sum x+4+8+y=30 =>x+y=18. To have 9 as mode, set x=9, y=9. So the list is [9,4,8,9]. Sorted: [4,8,9,9]. Median is (8+9)/2=8.5, which is not integer. So that doesn't satisfy the median condition. So that's invalid.

Alternatively, a_2=6 and a_3=6. Then median is 6, which is in the list. Not allowed.

So the only way to have the median as an integer not in the list is when the two middle numbers add to an even sum, and their average is not in the list. The only viable list I can find is [5,7,9,9], which gives the sum of squares as 236.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The list must have a sum of 30, unique mode 9, and a median that is an integer not in the list. After analyzing possible configurations, the list [5, 7, 9, 9] satisfies all conditions. The sum of the squares of its elements is \(5^2 + 7^2 + 9^2 + 9^2 = 25 + 49 + 81 + 81 = 236\).

\boxed{236}
