Okay, so I have this geometry problem here. Let me try to parse it step by step. We have points O at (0,0), A at (1/2, 0), and B at (0, sqrt(3)/2). So O is the origin, A is halfway along the x-axis between O and (1,0), and B is somewhere on the y-axis, sqrt(3)/2 is approximately 0.866, so a bit less than 1. 

Then, the family F consists of segments PQ of unit length lying in the first quadrant, with P on the x-axis and Q on the y-axis. So each PQ is a line segment from some point P(p,0) to Q(0,q), where p and q are positive real numbers, and the length of PQ is 1. Since it's in the first quadrant, both p and q are positive.

So, for each PQ in F, we know that sqrt(p^2 + q^2) = 1, because the distance between (p,0) and (0,q) is sqrt(p^2 + q^2). So each segment PQ is from (p,0) to (0,q), where p^2 + q^2 = 1. Therefore, the set of all such segments is a family of lines in the first quadrant, each of length 1, with endpoints on the axes.

Now, the problem says that there's a unique point C on AB, distinct from A and B, that does not belong to any segment from F other than AB. So, point C is on AB, but it's not on any other segment PQ from F except for AB itself. So AB is one of the segments in F, right? Because let me check: AB goes from (1/2, 0) to (0, sqrt(3)/2). The length of AB is sqrt( (1/2)^2 + (sqrt(3)/2)^2 ). Let's compute that: (1/2)^2 is 1/4, (sqrt(3)/2)^2 is 3/4, so total is 1, so AB is length 1, which is in F.

So AB is in F, and the point C is on AB, but not on any other segment in F. So, if I can find C such that it's the only point on AB that doesn't lie on any other PQ from F, then OC^2 is the value we need.

Our goal is to compute OC^2 and express it as p/q, then find p + q where p and q are coprime.

First, perhaps I should find the equation of AB. Let's see, points A(1/2, 0) and B(0, sqrt(3)/2). The slope of AB is (sqrt(3)/2 - 0)/(0 - 1/2) = (sqrt(3)/2) / (-1/2) = -sqrt(3). So the equation of AB is y = -sqrt(3)x + b. Plugging in point A: 0 = -sqrt(3)*(1/2) + b => b = sqrt(3)/2. So equation is y = -sqrt(3)x + sqrt(3)/2.

So any point C on AB can be parameterized as (t, -sqrt(3)t + sqrt(3)/2), where t ranges from 0 to 1/2.

Wait, actually, t should be such that when x is 1/2, y is 0, and when x is 0, y is sqrt(3)/2. So if parametrized with x from 0 to 1/2, y goes from sqrt(3)/2 to 0. So the parametric equations are:

x = 1/2 * s

y = sqrt(3)/2 * (1 - s)

where s ranges from 0 to 1. Because when s=0, x=0, y=sqrt(3)/2, which is point B. When s=1, x=1/2, y=0, which is point A.

Alternatively, I can use a parameter t such that t=0 is at B and t=1 at A, but perhaps it's easier to use s as above.

So, any point on AB is ( (1/2)s, (sqrt(3)/2)(1 - s) ) for s between 0 and 1.

So, point C is somewhere on AB, so its coordinates are ( (1/2)s, (sqrt(3)/2)(1 - s) ), and we need to find s such that C is not on any other segment from F except AB.

So, C is on AB, which is in F. But for all other PQ in F, C is not on PQ.

So, the problem is to find such a point C on AB, and compute OC^2.

So, perhaps the point C is where AB is tangent to some envelope of the family F. Because if we think about all the segments PQ in F, they form a family of lines, and their envelope would be a curve. The point C would be where AB is tangent to this envelope, so that near C, AB is the only segment from F passing through C.

Alternatively, perhaps the point C is where AB is the only segment in F that passes through it, meaning that for all other segments PQ in F, C is not on PQ.

Alternatively, perhaps we can model this by considering the equations of the segments PQ in F and seeing under what conditions a point C is on multiple such segments.

But since the problem states that C is on AB and not on any other PQ in F, except AB, then we can model this by ensuring that the coordinates of C don't satisfy any other equation of PQ in F.

So, perhaps to find C, we can consider the system where C lies on AB and also lies on another PQ in F. We need to find the point C where there's no other PQ in F passing through it, except AB.

Alternatively, perhaps the point C is the point on AB where AB is the limit of another PQ in F approaching it. Hmm, maybe the envelope approach is better.

Let me think: the family F is the set of line segments PQ from (p,0) to (0,q), where p^2 + q^2 =1. So each such segment lies on the line x/p + y/q = 1.

So, the equation of PQ is x/p + y/q = 1, with p^2 + q^2 =1.

So, perhaps we can model this as a family of lines x/p + y/q =1 with p^2 + q^2 =1.

We can parameterize p and q. Since p^2 + q^2 =1, we can write p = cosθ, q = sinθ, where θ is between 0 and π/2 (since p and q are positive). So, each line is x/cosθ + y/sinθ =1, where θ ∈ (0, π/2).

Then, the family of lines is x secθ + y cscθ =1.

We can write this as x secθ + y cscθ =1.

The envelope of this family is the curve that is tangent to each of these lines. So, to find the envelope, we can use the method where we take the derivative with respect to θ and solve the system.

The envelope satisfies both the equation of the line and the derivative with respect to θ.

So, let me denote F(x, y, θ) = x secθ + y cscθ -1 =0.

Then, the envelope is found by solving F(x, y, θ)=0 and ∂F/∂θ=0.

Compute ∂F/∂θ:

∂F/∂θ = x secθ tanθ - y cscθ cotθ =0.

So, x secθ tanθ = y cscθ cotθ.

Simplify:

x (1/cosθ)(sinθ/cosθ) = y (1/sinθ)(cosθ/sinθ).

Simplify LHS: x (sinθ)/(cos²θ).

RHS: y (cosθ)/(sin²θ).

So,

x sinθ / cos²θ = y cosθ / sin²θ

Cross multiply:

x sin³θ = y cos³θ

So,

x / y = (cos³θ)/(sin³θ) = (cosθ/sinθ)^3 = cot³θ.

So, x/y = cot³θ.

But from the original equation, F(x, y, θ)=0:

x secθ + y cscθ =1.

Which is x / cosθ + y / sinθ =1.

Let me express this as x / cosθ + y / sinθ =1.

Let me solve for x and y in terms of θ.

Let me set t = θ.

So, from the envelope condition, we have x / y = cot³t.

Let me write x = y cot³t.

Substituting into the original equation:

(y cot³t)/ cos t + y / sin t =1.

Factor y:

y [ cot³t / cos t + 1/sin t ] =1.

Simplify cot³t / cos t:

cot t = cos t / sin t.

So, cot³t = cos³t / sin³t.

So, cot³t / cos t = (cos³t / sin³t) / cos t = cos²t / sin³t.

So, the equation becomes:

y [ (cos²t / sin³t) + (1/sin t) ] =1.

Combine terms inside the brackets:

= [ cos²t / sin³t + 1/sin t ] = [ cos²t + sin²t ] / sin³t.

Because 1/sin t = sin²t / sin³t.

So,

= (cos²t + sin²t) / sin³t = 1 / sin³t.

So, now we have:

y [ 1 / sin³t ] =1 => y = sin³t.

Then, x = y cot³t = sin³t * (cos t / sin t)^3 = sin³t * (cos³t / sin³t) = cos³t.

So, x = cos³t, y = sin³t.

Therefore, the envelope of the family F is the parametric curve x = cos³t, y = sin³t, for t ∈ (0, π/2).

This is known as the astroid curve, but in this case, it's the envelope of the lines x secθ + y cscθ =1.

Wait, actually, the astroid is usually given by x^(2/3) + y^(2/3) = a^(2/3), but in this case, the parametric equations are x = cos³t, y = sin³t, which indeed satisfy x^(2/3) + y^(2/3) = cos²t + sin²t =1. So the envelope is the astroid x^(2/3) + y^(2/3) =1.

So, the envelope is the astroid, and AB is one of the lines in the family F. We need to find the point C on AB that's also on the envelope, because that would be the point where AB is tangent to the astroid. Because the envelope is the curve tangent to each member of the family, so at the point of tangency, the line AB is tangent to the astroid.

So, point C is the point where AB is tangent to the astroid x^(2/3) + y^(2/3) =1.

Hence, to find C, we can find the point of tangency between AB and the astroid.

So, let's compute the equation of AB and find its point of tangency with the astroid.

The equation of AB is y = -sqrt(3) x + sqrt(3)/2.

We can write this as y = -sqrt(3) x + (sqrt(3)/2).

So, we need to find the point (x, y) that lies on both AB and the astroid, and also satisfies the condition that AB is tangent to the astroid at that point.

The condition for tangency is that the derivative of the astroid at that point equals the slope of AB.

First, let's find the derivative of the astroid x^(2/3) + y^(2/3) =1.

Differentiate both sides:

(2/3) x^(-1/3) + (2/3) y^(-1/3) dy/dx =0.

Solving for dy/dx:

dy/dx = - (x^(-1/3)) / (y^(-1/3)) ) = - (y^(1/3)) / (x^(1/3)).

So, dy/dx at point (x,y) is - (y^(1/3)) / (x^(1/3)).

The slope of AB is -sqrt(3).

So, at the point of tangency, the derivative of the astroid equals the slope of AB.

Therefore,

- (y^(1/3)) / (x^(1/3)) = -sqrt(3).

Simplify:

(y^(1/3)) / (x^(1/3)) = sqrt(3).

Raise both sides to the power of 3:

(y) / (x) = (sqrt(3))^3 = 3*sqrt(3).

So,

y = 3*sqrt(3) x.

But we also know that the point (x,y) lies on AB, so y = -sqrt(3) x + sqrt(3)/2.

So, substituting y from above into this equation:

3*sqrt(3) x = -sqrt(3) x + sqrt(3)/2.

Let me write that down:

3√3 x = -√3 x + √3/2.

Bring all terms to the left:

3√3 x + √3 x - √3/2 =0.

Factor x:

(3√3 + √3) x = √3/2.

So,

4√3 x = √3/2.

Divide both sides by √3:

4x = 1/2.

So,

x = 1/(8).

So, x = 1/8.

Then, y = 3√3 x = 3√3 * (1/8) = 3√3 /8.

So, the point of tangency is (1/8, 3√3/8).

Therefore, point C is (1/8, 3√3/8).

So, OC is the distance from the origin to C, which is sqrt( (1/8)^2 + (3√3/8)^2 ).

Compute OC^2:

(1/8)^2 + (3√3/8)^2 = 1/64 + (9*3)/64 = 1/64 + 27/64 = 28/64 = 7/16.

Simplify 28/64: divide numerator and denominator by 4: 7/16.

So, OC^2 = 7/16.

Therefore, p=7, q=16, so p + q=23.

Wait, but I should verify this. Let me double-check.

First, point C is (1/8, 3√3/8). Let me check if it lies on AB.

Equation of AB: y = -sqrt(3) x + sqrt(3)/2.

Compute y when x=1/8:

y = -sqrt(3)*(1/8) + sqrt(3)/2 = (-sqrt(3)/8) + (4 sqrt(3)/8) = (3 sqrt(3))/8. Which matches the y-coordinate. So, yes, C is on AB.

Now, does C lie on any other segment from F besides AB?

But since C is the point where AB is tangent to the envelope (the astroid), it should lie only on AB and no other PQ in F. Because the envelope consists of points where each line is tangent, so each point on the envelope lies on exactly one line from F (the tangent line). So, since C is on the envelope, it's on AB and no other PQ from F.

Thus, it should be correct.

Hence, OC^2 is 7/16, so p + q is 23.

The problem involves finding a unique point \( C \) on the line segment \( \overline{AB} \) such that \( C \) does not lie on any other segment from the family \( \mathcal{F} \) except \( \overline{AB} \). 

1. **Equation of Line AB**: The points \( A \) and \( B \) are \( \left(\frac{1}{2}, 0\right) \) and \( \left(0, \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right) \), respectively. The slope of \( AB \) is \( -\sqrt{3} \), leading to the equation \( y = -\sqrt{3}x + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \).

2. **Family of Segments \( \mathcal{F} \)**: Each segment \( \overline{PQ} \) in \( \mathcal{F} \) has endpoints \( P(p, 0) \) and \( Q(0, q) \) with \( p^2 + q^2 = 1 \). These segments form lines of the form \( \frac{x}{p} + \frac{y}{q} = 1 \).

3. **Envelope of the Family**: The envelope of these lines is found to be the astroid \( x^{2/3} + y^{2/3} = 1 \).

4. **Point of Tangency**: The point \( C \) is where \( AB \) is tangent to the astroid. Solving for the intersection and ensuring the slopes match, we find \( C \) at \( \left(\frac{1}{8}, \frac{3\sqrt{3}}{8}\right) \).

5. **Distance Calculation**: The distance \( OC \) is calculated as \( \sqrt{\left(\frac{1}{8}\right)^2 + \left(\frac{3\sqrt{3}}{8}\right)^2} \), leading to \( OC^2 = \frac{7}{16} \).

Thus, \( OC^2 = \frac{7}{16} \), so \( p = 7 \) and \( q = 16 \), giving \( p + q = 23 \).

\boxed{23}
