Okay, so I've got this math problem here. Let me try to figure it out step by step. The problem says:

"Let \( p \) be the least prime number for which there exists a positive integer \( n \) such that \( n^4 + 1 \) is divisible by \( p^2 \). Find the least positive integer \( m \) such that \( m^4 + 1 \) is divisible by \( p^2 \)."

Hmm, okay. So I need to find the smallest prime \( p \) where \( p^2 \) divides \( n^4 + 1 \) for some positive integer \( n \). Then, once I find that prime, I have to find the smallest \( m \) such that \( m^4 + 1 \) is divisible by \( p^2 \).

Let me break this down. First, I need to find the smallest prime \( p \) such that \( p^2 \) divides \( n^4 + 1 \) for some \( n \). That means for this prime \( p \), there exists \( n \) where \( n^4 \equiv -1 \mod p^2 \).

I remember that for primes where -1 is a quartic residue modulo \( p \), there might be solutions to such congruences. Also, I think that primes where \( p \equiv 1 \mod 8 \) might have certain properties with quartic residues. Not too sure, but maybe I should check small primes and see.

Let me list the primes in order: 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, etc.

I should check each prime \( p \) starting from the smallest to see if \( n^4 \equiv -1 \mod p^2 \) has a solution.

Starting with \( p = 2 \). Let's see: \( n^4 + 1 \) modulo \( 4 \).

If \( n \) is even, say \( n = 2k \), then \( n^4 = 16k^4 \equiv 0 \mod 4 \), so \( n^4 + 1 \equiv 1 \mod 4 \). If \( n \) is odd, \( n = 2k + 1 \), then \( n^4 = (2k+1)^4 \). Let's compute \( (2k+1)^4 \) modulo 4:

First, \( (2k+1)^2 = 4k^2 + 4k + 1 \equiv 1 \mod 4 \). So \( (2k+1)^4 = ((2k+1)^2)^2 \equiv 1^2 = 1 \mod 4 \). Thus, \( n^4 + 1 \equiv 2 \mod 4 \) for odd \( n \). So for \( p = 2 \), \( p^2 = 4 \). We can't get \( n^4 + 1 \equiv 0 \mod 4 \) because both cases give 1 or 2 mod 4, neither of which is 0. So \( p=2 \) doesn't work.

Next, \( p = 3 \). Let's check if there's an \( n \) such that \( n^4 \equiv -1 \mod 9 \).

Compute \( n^4 \) modulo 9 for \( n = 1,2,...,8 \):

1^4 = 1 mod 9

2^4 = 16 mod 9 = 7

3^4 = 81 mod 9 = 0

4^4 = (4^2)^2 = 16^2 mod 9. 16 mod 9 is 7, so 7^2 = 49 mod 9 = 4

5^4 = (5^2)^2 = 25^2 mod 9. 25 mod 9 is 7, so 7^2 = 49 mod 9 = 4

6^4 = (6^2)^2 = 36^2 mod 9 = 0

7^4 = (7^2)^2 = 49^2 mod 9. 49 mod 9 is 4, so 4^2 = 16 mod 9 = 7

8^4 = (8^2)^2 = 64^2 mod 9. 64 mod 9 is 1, so 1^2 = 1 mod 9.

So the possible residues are 0,1,4,7. -1 mod 9 is 8. None of the \( n^4 \) mod 9 is 8. So \( p=3 \) doesn't work either.

Next, \( p=5 \). Let's see if there's an \( n \) with \( n^4 \equiv -1 \mod 25 \).

First, I can check whether -1 is a quartic residue mod 5, then see if it's a quartic residue mod 25.

In mod 5, the possible residues are 0,1,2,3,4.

Compute \( n^4 \) mod 5:

1^4 = 1

2^4 = 16 mod 5 = 1

3^4 = 81 mod 5 = 1

4^4 = 256 mod 5 = 1

So all non-zero n^4 mod 5 are 1. So -1 mod 5 is 4, which isn't achieved by any n^4 mod 5. So in mod 5, there's no solution. Hence, mod 25, since mod 5 doesn't have a solution, mod 25 won't either. So \( p=5 \) doesn't work.

Next prime: \( p=7 \).

Check if \( n^4 \equiv -1 \mod 49 \).

First, let's check mod 7 whether -1 is a quartic residue.

Compute \( n^4 \) mod 7 for n=1 to 6:

1^4=1

2^4=16 mod7=2

3^4=81 mod7=4

4^4=256 mod7=256-7*36=256-252=4

Wait, 4^4 is (4^2)^2=16^2 mod7=2^2=4 mod7.

5^4: (5^2)^2=25^2 mod7=4^2=16 mod7=2.

6^4: (6^2)^2=36^2 mod7=1^2=1.

So the quartic residues mod7 are 1,2,4. -1 mod7 is 6, which isn't among them. So mod7, -1 isn't a quartic residue. Therefore, mod49 also won't have a solution. So \( p=7 \) is out.

Next prime: \( p=11 \).

Check mod 11 whether -1 is a quartic residue.

Compute \( n^4 \) mod11 for n=1 to 10:

1^4=1

2^4=16 mod11=5

3^4=81 mod11=4

4^4=256 mod11=256-23*11=256-253=3

5^4=625 mod11: 625 /11=56*11=616, 625-616=9

6^4=1296 mod11: 1296 /11=117*11=1287, 1296-1287=9

7^4=2401 mod11: 2401 - 218*11=2401-2398=3

8^4=4096 mod11: 4096 - 372*11=4096-4092=4

9^4=6561 mod11: 6561 /11=596*11=6556, 6561-6556=5

10^4=10000 mod11: 10000 mod11: 10000 /11=909*11=9999, 10000-9999=1.

So the quartic residues mod11 are 1,3,4,5,9. -1 mod11 is 10, which is not in the list. So mod11, no solution, hence mod121 also no. So \( p=11 \) doesn't work.

Next prime: \( p=13 \).

Check mod13 if -1 is a quartic residue.

Compute n^4 mod13 for n=1 to 12:

1^4=1

2^4=16 mod13=3

3^4=81 mod13= 81-6*13=81-78=3

Wait, that can't be right. Let me compute each step carefully:

1^4=1 mod13=1

2^4=16 mod13=3

3^4=81 mod13: 13*6=78, 81-78=3

4^4: 256 mod13. 13*19=247, 256-247=9

5^4: 625 mod13. 13*48=624, 625-624=1

6^4=1296 mod13. 13*99=1287, 1296-1287=9

7^4=2401 mod13. Let me compute 7^2=49 mod13=10, then 10^2=100 mod13=9.

8^4: 8^2=64 mod13=12, then 12^2=144 mod13=1.

9^4: 9^2=81 mod13=3, 3^2=9 mod13.

10^4: 10^2=100 mod13=9, 9^2=81 mod13=3.

11^4: 11^2=121 mod13=4, 4^2=16 mod13=3.

12^4: 12^2=144 mod13=1, 1^2=1 mod13.

So the quartic residues mod13 are 1,3,9. -1 mod13 is 12, which isn't in the list. So mod13, no solution, hence mod169 also no. So \( p=13 \) is out.

Next prime: \( p=17 \).

Check mod17 whether -1 is a quartic residue.

Compute n^4 mod17 for n=1 to 16.

Alternatively, perhaps there's a smarter way.

First, note that the multiplicative group mod17 is cyclic of order 16. The quartic residues are the 4th powers, which would form a subgroup of order 4. So the quartic residues are the squares of the squares, so they would be the squares in the subgroup of quadratic residues.

Wait, perhaps I can compute the quartic residues mod17.

Compute each n^4 mod17:

1^4=1

2^4=16 mod17

3^4=81 mod17: 81 - 4*17=81-68=13

4^4=256 mod17: 256 /17=15*17=255, 256-255=1

5^4=625 mod17. 625 - 36*17=625-612=13

6^4=1296 mod17. Let's compute 1296 /17: 17*76=1292, 1296-1292=4

7^4=2401 mod17. 2401 /17=141*17=2397, 2401-2397=4

8^4=4096 mod17. 4096 - 241*17=4096-4097= -1 mod17=16

9^4=6561 mod17. 6561 /17=385*17=6545, 6561-6545=16

10^4=10000 mod17. Let's compute 10000 mod17. 17*588=10000-17*588=10000-10000=0? Wait, 17*588=10000-17*588= Wait, 17*588=10,000-17*588? Wait, 17*500=8500, 17*588=17*(500+88)=8500 + 17*88. 17*80=1360, 17*8=136, so 1360+136=1496. So 8500 +1496=9996. So 10,000 mod17=10,000 - 9996=4.

So 10^4 mod17=4.

11^4: 11^2=121 mod17=121-7*17=121-119=2. Then 2^2=4 mod17.

12^4: 12^2=144 mod17=144-8*17=144-136=8. Then 8^2=64 mod17=13.

13^4: 13^2=169 mod17=169-9*17=169-153=16. Then 16^2=256 mod17=1.

14^4: 14^2=196 mod17=196-11*17=196-187=9. Then 9^2=81 mod17=13.

15^4: 15^2=225 mod17=225-13*17=225-221=4. Then 4^2=16 mod17.

16^4: 16^2=256 mod17=1. Then 1^2=1 mod17.

So compiling the quartic residues mod17: 1,4,13,16. -1 mod17 is 16. Oh, wait, 16 is in the quartic residues! Because 8^4 mod17=16, as we saw earlier.

So, mod17, -1 is a quartic residue, because 8^4 ≡ -1 mod17. So that means there exists an n with n^4 ≡ -1 mod 17. Since mod17 works, maybe mod17^2=289 also works? Or perhaps not necessarily. I need to check if there's an n such that n^4 ≡ -1 mod289.

Wait, so p=17 is a candidate. Is it the smallest prime where such an n exists?

Wait, we've checked primes up to 17, and only 17 has a solution mod p. So 17 is the least such prime.

So p=17 is the prime we're looking for. Now, the second part is to find the minimal positive integer m such that m^4 +1 is divisible by p^2=289.

So, find the least m where m^4 ≡ -1 mod 289.

Given that 8^4 ≡ -1 mod17, perhaps m is congruent to 8 mod17. But we need to lift this solution to mod289.

This is similar to solving a congruence modulo a prime power, where we have a solution modulo p and want to find a solution modulo p^2.

I remember Hensel's lemma, which allows lifting solutions under certain conditions. Since we have a solution modulo 17, and we're looking for a solution modulo 17^2=289, let's try to find m ≡8 mod17 such that m^4 ≡-1 mod289.

Let me set m =8 +17k, where k is an integer we need to determine.

Compute m^4 = (8 +17k)^4.

But expanding this might be tedious. Let me compute it step by step.

First, compute (8 +17k)^4. Let me use the binomial theorem:

(8 +17k)^4 = 8^4 + 4*8^3*(17k) + 6*8^2*(17k)^2 + 4*8*(17k)^3 + (17k)^4.

Compute each term modulo 289, since higher powers of 17 will be 0 mod289.

First, 8^4: 8^2=64, 64^2=4096. 4096 mod289: Let's divide 4096 by 289.

289 *14=4046. 4096-4046=50. So 8^4=4096≡50 mod289.

Next term: 4*8^3*(17k). 8^3=512. 512*4=2048. 2048*(17k) = 34816k. 34816 mod289: Let's compute 289*119=289*(120-1)=289*120 -289=34680 -289=34391. 34816-34391=425. 425 mod289=425-289=136. So this term is 136k mod289.

Third term: 6*8^2*(17k)^2. 8^2=64, (17k)^2=289k^2. So 6*64=384. 384*289k^2. But 289k^2 is 0 mod289, so this term is 0 mod289.

Fourth term: 4*8*(17k)^3. 17^3=4913, which is 0 mod289 because 289*17=4913. So this term is 0 mod289.

Fifth term: (17k)^4=83521k^4, which is 0 mod289.

So putting it all together:

m^4 ≡50 +136k mod289.

We need m^4 ≡-1 mod289. Since -1 mod289 is 288.

So set up the equation:

50 +136k ≡288 mod289.

Subtract 50: 136k ≡238 mod289.

So, 136k ≡238 mod289.

We can write this as: 136k ≡238 mod289.

To solve for k, we can find the inverse of 136 mod289.

First, check if 136 and 289 are coprime. 289 is 17^2, 136=8*17. So 136 and 289 share a common factor of 17. Hmm, so 136k ≡238 mod289.

Divide both sides by 17: 8k ≡14 mod17.

So, 8k ≡14 mod17.

Find the inverse of 8 mod17. 8*x ≡1 mod17.

Testing x= 15: 8*15=120 mod17=120-7*17=120-119=1. So inverse is 15.

So k ≡14*15 mod17=210 mod17. 17*12=204, 210-204=6. So k≡6 mod17.

So k=6 +17t.

So m=8 +17k=8 +17*(6 +17t)=8+102 +289t=110 +289t.

So the minimal positive m is 110. So m=110.

Wait, but let me check if 110^4 +1 is indeed divisible by 289.

Compute 110^4:

First, 110 mod289 is 110.

Compute 110^2=12100. 12100 mod289: Let's compute how many times 289 fits into 12100.

289*41=289*(40+1)=11560 +289=11849.

12100 -11849=251. So 110^2 ≡251 mod289.

Now compute 110^4=(110^2)^2=251^2 mod289.

251^2=63001. Now divide 63001 by289.

Compute 289*217=289*(200+17)=57800 +4913=62713.

63001 -62713=288. So 251^2 ≡288 mod289.

So 110^4 ≡288 mod289. So 110^4 +1 ≡288 +1=289≡0 mod289.

Yes, that works. So m=110 is the minimal such positive integer.

But wait, could there be a smaller m? Let me think. We constructed m=8 +17k, with k=6. So that's the minimal solution. But perhaps another solution with a smaller k? Let me check k=6, which gives m=110. But maybe if t is negative, but since m has to be positive, the minimal t is zero. So m=110 is the smallest positive integer.

Wait, but let me check if m=8 is a solution mod289. 8^4=4096, which mod289 is 50. 50 +1=51≠0 mod289, so no. So the next possible is 110. So m=110 is indeed the minimal.
