Okay, so I've got this problem here: Let ω ≠ 1 be a 13th root of unity. I need to find the remainder when the product from k=0 to 12 of (2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k}) is divided by 1000. Hmm, that's a mouthful. Let me try to unpack this.

First, I know that ω is a primitive 13th root of unity because it's given that ω ≠ 1 and it's a 13th root. So ω^13 = 1, and ω^k for k=0 to 12 gives all the distinct 13th roots of unity.

The product we're looking at is ∏_{k=0}^{12} (2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k}). That seems complicated, but maybe I can find a way to simplify it.

Let me write out a few terms to see if I can spot a pattern or find a way to factor or manipulate the product.

Wait, the product goes from k=0 to 12, which are all the exponents of ω, each appearing once. So each term is a function of ω^k.

Let me denote ζ = ω^k. Then each term becomes 2 - 2ζ + ζ². So the product is the product over all ζ ≠ 1 (since ω ≠1, but wait, when k=0, ω^0 =1. So one of the terms is when ζ=1.

Wait, so for k=0, the term is 2 - 2*(1) + (1)^2 = 2 - 2 +1 =1. So the first term is 1.

So the product is 1 times the product from k=1 to 12 of (2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k}).

Hmm. So maybe I can consider the polynomial whose roots are ω^k for k=1 to 12, which is the cyclotomic polynomial Φ_13(x) = x^12 + x^11 + ... + x +1. But I'm not sure if that directly helps here.

Alternatively, perhaps I can consider the polynomial P(x) = ∏_{k=0}^{12} (x - ω^k) = x^13 - 1. Because the roots are all the 13th roots of unity.

But here, I'm dealing with a product that's not linear in x. Each term is 2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k}. Maybe I can factor that expression.

Let me see: 2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k} = 2(1 - ω^k) + ω^{2k}.

Alternatively, let's write it as ω^{2k} - 2ω^k + 2. Maybe that's a quadratic in ω^k? Let's see:

Let me denote ζ = ω^k. Then the term becomes ζ² - 2ζ + 2. So for each k, the term is ζ² - 2ζ + 2.

So the product becomes ∏_{k=0}^{12} (ζ² - 2ζ + 2), evaluated at ζ = ω^k.

Wait, but when k=0, ζ=1, so that term is 1 - 2 + 2 = 1, as before.

So the product is 1 * ∏_{ζ ≠1} (ζ² - 2ζ + 2). So the product is ∏_{ζ ≠1} (ζ² - 2ζ + 2).

Hmm, now I need to compute this product over all ζ ≠1, where ζ^13 =1.

Wait, perhaps I can relate this product to polynomials evaluated at certain points.

I know that for cyclotomic polynomials, Φ_n(x) is the product of (x - ζ) where ζ runs over the primitive nth roots of unity. But in this case, ζ runs over all 13th roots of unity except 1, so that product is Φ_13(x) = x^12 + x^11 + ... + x + 1.

But I'm dealing with the product of (ζ² - 2ζ + 2) over all ζ^13=1, ζ≠1.

Alternatively, perhaps I can write this product as the value of a certain polynomial evaluated at x= something.

Wait, let's think about the product ∏_{ζ} (ζ² - 2ζ + 2), where ζ^13 =1.

If I can find a polynomial Q(x) such that Q(ζ) = ζ² - 2ζ + 2, then the product would be the product of Q(ζ) over all ζ^13=1. 

Alternatively, consider that for each ζ, the term is (ζ)^2 - 2ζ + 2. So maybe we can write this as (ζ - a)(ζ - b), where a and b are roots of x² -2x +2=0.

Let me solve x² -2x +2 =0. The roots are [2 ± sqrt(4 -8)] / 2 = [2 ± sqrt(-4)] /2 = 1 ± i.

So the term (ζ² -2ζ +2) factors as (ζ - (1+i))(ζ - (1-i)).

Therefore, the product ∏_{ζ} (ζ - (1+i))(ζ - (1-i)) = [∏_{ζ} (ζ - (1+i))] [∏_{ζ} (ζ - (1-i))].

But ζ runs over all 13th roots of unity, except ζ=1. Wait, no. Wait, when k=0, ζ=1, and the term is 1 as before, but in the product after removing k=0, it's from k=1 to 12, so all ζ except ζ=1.

Wait, no. Wait, when k=0, ζ=1, and the term is 1, but in the product for the overall expression, the product is from k=0 to 12, which includes ζ=1.

Wait, no, actually, the product is ∏_{k=0}^{12} (2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k}) = 1 * ∏_{k=1}^{12} (2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k}).

But wait, in the initial product, when k=0, it's 1, so the rest from k=1 to 12 are the other 12 terms. So the product ∏_{k=1}^{12} (2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k}) is equal to ∏_{ζ ≠1} (ζ² - 2ζ + 2).

But the product over all ζ^13=1 is ∏_{ζ} (ζ² - 2ζ + 2) = ∏_{ζ} (ζ - (1+i))(ζ - (1-i)).

But ζ runs over all 13th roots of unity, including 1. So the product is [∏_{ζ} (ζ - (1+i))] [∏_{ζ} (ζ - (1-i))].

But the product over all ζ of (x - ζ) is x^13 -1. So ∏_{ζ} (x - ζ) = x^13 -1.

Therefore, ∏_{ζ} (x - (1+i)) = (1+i)^13 -1, and ∏_{ζ} (x - (1-i)) = (1 -i)^13 -1.

Wait, let's verify that.

Wait, no, that's not quite right. The product over ζ of (x - ζ) is x^13 -1, which is true. So, if we set x = (1+i), then ∏_{ζ} ((1+i) - ζ) = (1+i)^13 -1.

Similarly, ∏_{ζ} ((1 -i) - ζ) = (1 - i)^13 -1.

So then, the overall product ∏_{ζ} (ζ² -2ζ +2) = ∏_{ζ} (ζ - (1+i))(ζ - (1 -i)) = [(1+i)^13 -1] * [(1 -i)^13 -1].

But wait, in our case, we don't have all ζ, but ζ ≠1. Because the product starts at k=1, so ζ ≠1. So we need to adjust for that.

Wait, because when k=0, ζ=1, and the term is 1, so the product from k=1 to 12 is ∏_{ζ ≠1} (ζ² -2ζ +2) = [∏_{ζ} (ζ² -2ζ +2)] / (1² -2*1 +2) = [ ( (1+i)^13 -1 ) * ( (1 -i)^13 -1 ) ] / (1 -2 +2) ) = [ ( (1+i)^13 -1 ) * ( (1 -i)^13 -1 ) ] / 1.

Wait, because when ζ=1, the term is (1)^2 -2(1) +2 = 1 -2 +2 =1. So the product over all ζ, including ζ=1, is ( (1+i)^13 -1 ) * ( (1 -i)^13 -1 ). But since we're excluding ζ=1, and the term at ζ=1 is 1, the product from ζ≠1 is equal to that same product. So that product is [ (1+i)^13 -1 ] * [ (1 -i)^13 -1 ].

Wait, but wait, if the product over all ζ^13=1 of (ζ² -2ζ +2) is equal to [ (1+i)^13 -1 ][ (1 -i)^13 -1 ], then that includes ζ=1. But our original product is from k=0 to 12, which includes ζ=1, so the product is exactly that value, which is [ (1+i)^13 -1 ][ (1 -i)^13 -1 ].

Wait, that's conflicting with my earlier thought where I thought the product from k=1 to 12 is equal to this. Wait, no, in the problem, it's the product from k=0 to 12, which includes ζ=1, so the product is indeed [ (1+i)^13 -1 ][ (1 -i)^13 -1 ].

Wait, but let me double-check. If I have ∏_{k=0}^{12} (2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k}) = ∏_{k=0}^{12} (ω^{2k} - 2ω^k + 2). Let me denote each term as (ω^{2k} - 2ω^k +2). Since ω^13=1, ω^{2k} is also a root of unity, but perhaps that's not directly helpful.

But earlier, I saw that each term can be written as (ω^k - (1+i))(ω^k - (1 -i)). So the product over k=0 to 12 is ∏_{k=0}^{12} (ω^k - (1+i)) (ω^k - (1 -i)).

But since ω^k runs through all 13th roots of unity as k goes from 0 to 12, the product becomes [∏_{ζ} (ζ - (1+i))] [∏_{ζ} (ζ - (1 -i))], where ζ are the 13th roots of unity.

And as I noted earlier, ∏_{ζ} (x - ζ) = x^13 -1. So substituting x =1+i, we get ∏_{ζ} (1+i - ζ) = (1+i)^13 -1. Similarly, substituting x=1-i, we get ∏_{ζ} (1-i - ζ) = (1-i)^13 -1.

Therefore, the product is [ (1+i)^13 -1 ] * [ (1-i)^13 -1 ].

So that's the value of the product. Now, I need to compute this and then find the remainder when divided by 1000.

So let me compute (1+i)^13 and (1-i)^13 first.

Let me compute (1+i)^13. Since 1+i can be expressed in polar form. The modulus is sqrt(1^2 +1^2) = sqrt(2), and the argument is π/4 radians (45 degrees). So (1+i) = sqrt(2) * e^{iπ/4}.

Therefore, (1+i)^13 = (sqrt(2))^13 * e^{i *13π/4}.

Similarly, (1-i)^13 = (sqrt(2))^13 * e^{-i *13π/4}.

Now, let's compute these exponents.

First, (sqrt(2))^13 = (2^{1/2})^13 = 2^{13/2} = 2^6 * 2^{1/2} = 64 * sqrt(2).

Next, let's compute the angles.

13π/4 can be simplified by subtracting multiples of 2π. 13/4 = 3 + 1/4, so 3π + π/4. But 3π is equivalent to π modulo 2π because 3π - 2π = π.

Wait, wait: 13π/4 is equal to 3π + π/4. But 3π is more than 2π, so let's subtract 2π: 13π/4 - 2π = 13π/4 - 8π/4 = 5π/4. So e^{i*13π/4} = e^{i*5π/4}.

Similarly, e^{-i*13π/4} = e^{-i*5π/4}.

So now, (1+i)^13 = 64*sqrt(2) * e^{i*5π/4}.

Similarly, (1 -i)^13 = 64*sqrt(2) * e^{-i*5π/4}.

So, let's compute (1+i)^13 and (1-i)^13:

e^{i*5π/4} = cos(5π/4) + i sin(5π/4) = (-sqrt(2)/2) - i (sqrt(2)/2).

Similarly, e^{-i*5π/4} = cos(5π/4) - i sin(5π/4) = (-sqrt(2)/2) + i (sqrt(2)/2).

So, (1+i)^13 = 64*sqrt(2) * [ (-sqrt(2)/2) - i (sqrt(2)/2) ].

Multiply this out: 64*sqrt(2) * (-sqrt(2)/2) = 64*(-2/2) = 64*(-1) = -64. Similarly, the imaginary part is 64*sqrt(2) * (-sqrt(2)/2) i = -64i.

So (1+i)^13 = -64 - 64i.

Similarly, (1-i)^13 = 64*sqrt(2) * [ (-sqrt(2)/2) + i (sqrt(2)/2) ].

Multiplying out: 64*sqrt(2)*(-sqrt(2)/2) = -64, and 64*sqrt(2)*(sqrt(2)/2)i = 64i.

So (1-i)^13 = -64 + 64i.

Now, compute (1+i)^13 -1 = (-64 -64i) -1 = -65 -64i.

Similarly, (1-i)^13 -1 = (-64 +64i) -1 = -65 +64i.

So the product is [ -65 -64i ] * [ -65 +64i ].

Let me compute this product. It's of the form (a - b)(a + b) = a^2 - b^2, where a = -65 and b=64i.

Wait, no, wait: The product is (-65 -64i)(-65 +64i) = (-65)^2 - (64i)^2.

Compute each part:

(-65)^2 = 4225.

(64i)^2 = (64)^2 * i^2 = 4096 * (-1) = -4096.

So the product is 4225 - (-4096) = 4225 +4096 = 8321.

So the product is 8321.

Wait, that seems manageable. But let me double-check the multiplication.

Alternatively, expand the product:

(-65 -64i)(-65 +64i) = (-65)(-65) + (-65)(64i) + (-64i)(-65) + (-64i)(64i).

Calculate term by term:

First term: (-65)*(-65) = 4225.

Second term: (-65)*(64i) = -4160i.

Third term: (-64i)*(-65) = 4160i.

Fourth term: (-64i)*(64i) = (-64)(64)(i^2) = (-4096)(-1) = +4096.

Now, add all terms:

4225 -4160i +4160i +4096.

The -4160i and +4160i cancel out, leaving 4225 +4096 = 8321.

Yes, that's correct.

So the product is 8321.

Wait, but wait a second, the original product is from k=0 to 12, which is the product we just calculated as 8321.

But I need to find the remainder when 8321 is divided by 1000.

So 8321 divided by 1000 is 8 with a remainder of 321, because 8*1000=8000, and 8321-8000=321.

So the remainder is 321.

Wait, let me confirm:

1000 *8=8000.

8321-8000=321.

Yes, so 8321 mod1000 is 321.

But wait, hold on. Wait, did I compute everything correctly?

Wait, let me go back through the steps.

First, I expressed each term as (ζ^2 -2ζ +2), which factors into (ζ - (1+i))(ζ - (1-i)).

Then, the product becomes the product over all ζ (including ζ=1) of (ζ - (1+i))(ζ - (1-i)).

Which is equal to [(1+i)^13 -1] * [(1 -i)^13 -1].

Then I computed (1+i)^13 = -64 -64i, and (1 -i)^13 = -64 +64i.

Subtracting 1 from each gives (-65 -64i) and (-65 +64i).

Multiplying those gives 8321.

Wait, but earlier, when I thought about the product from ζ≠1, I thought that the product would be [ (1+i)^13 -1 ] * [ (1 -i)^13 -1 ] because the term at ζ=1 is 1, so the product remains the same as including it.

Wait, no, but in the problem, the product is from k=0 to 12, so it includes ζ=1, which gives 1, so the product is exactly [ (1+i)^13 -1 ] * [ (1 -i)^13 -1 ] which is 8321. So the remainder when divided by 1000 is 321.

But wait, another approach: sometimes in these problems, the product might not include ζ=1, but in this case, since k=0 is included, the product does include ζ=1.

Wait, but let me check: when k=0, ζ=1. The term is 2 -2*1 +1^2 = 2 -2 +1=1, as we saw earlier. So yes, the product is indeed 8321, and 8321 mod1000 is 321.

Wait, but perhaps I made a miscalculation in computing (1+i)^13 and (1-i)^13. Let me check that again.

Wait, so (1+i) in polar form is sqrt(2) e^{iπ/4}, so raising to the 13th power: (sqrt(2))^13 e^{i*13π/4}.

(sqrt(2))^13 = (2^{1/2})^13 = 2^{13/2} = 2^6 * 2^{1/2} = 64 * sqrt(2).

13π/4 is equal to 3π + π/4. Since angles are periodic modulo 2π, 13π/4 - 2π = 13π/4 - 8π/4 =5π/4, which is in the third quadrant. So e^{i5π/4} = cos(5π/4) + i sin(5π/4) = (-sqrt(2)/2) - i (sqrt(2)/2).

So (1+i)^13 = 64*sqrt(2) * [ (-sqrt(2)/2) - i (sqrt(2)/2) ].

Multiply this out: 64*sqrt(2)*(-sqrt(2)/2) = 64*(-2/2) = -64.

Similarly, the imaginary part is 64*sqrt(2)*(-sqrt(2)/2) i = -64i.

So (1+i)^13 = -64 -64i.

Similarly, (1 -i)^13 is the conjugate, so it's -64 +64i.

So then, (1+i)^13 -1 is (-64 -64i) -1 = -65 -64i.

And (1 -i)^13 -1 is (-64 +64i) -1 = -65 +64i.

Multiplying these two: (-65 -64i)(-65 +64i) = (-65)^2 - (64i)^2 = 4225 - (4096)(-1) = 4225 +4096 = 8321.

Yes, that's correct.

So the product is 8321, which mod 1000 is 321.

Therefore, the remainder is 321.

The product is computed by recognizing each term as a quadratic in a root of unity, factoring it, and then evaluating the product over all roots, leading to the result 8321. The remainder when divided by 1000 is 321.

\boxed{321}
