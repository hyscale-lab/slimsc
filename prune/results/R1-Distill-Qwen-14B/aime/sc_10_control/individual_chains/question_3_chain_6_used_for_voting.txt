Okay, so I've got this probability problem here about Jen entering a lottery. Let me try to understand it step by step. 

Jen picks 4 distinct numbers from the set S, which is {1,2,3,...,9,10}. So, S has 10 numbers in total. Then, 4 numbers are randomly chosen from S. She wins a prize if at least two of her numbers match the randomly chosen numbers. She wins the grand prize if all four of her numbers match the chosen numbers.

The question is about finding the probability that she wins the grand prize given that she won a prize. They mention this probability is m/n where m and n are coprime, and we need to find m + n.

Hmm, okay. So, this is a conditional probability problem. The formula I remember for conditional probability is P(A|B) = P(A ∩ B) / P(B). In this case, event A is winning the grand prize, and event B is winning a prize. Since winning the grand prize inherently means she has at least two numbers matching, A is a subset of B. So, the intersection A ∩ B is just A. That simplifies things a bit.

So, P(A|B) = P(A) / P(B).

So, I need to compute P(A) and P(B).

Let me figure out what P(A) is. P(A) is the probability that all four of Jen's numbers match the randomly chosen four numbers. Since 4 numbers are chosen from 10, the total number of possible combinations is C(10,4). The number of favorable outcomes for A is just 1, because there's only one way that all four numbers match.

So, P(A) = 1 / C(10,4). Let me compute C(10,4). That's 10! / (4! * (10-4)!) = (10*9*8*7)/(4*3*2*1) = 210. So, P(A) is 1/210.

Now, I need to find P(B), the probability that she wins at least two numbers. So, she wins a prize if she matches at least two of the four numbers. So, P(B) is the probability that she has exactly 2, 3, or 4 matching numbers.

Alternatively, it's easier to compute 1 minus the probability that she has fewer than two matches, i.e., zero or one matches.

Wait, but I think it's manageable to compute it directly. Let me outline the possible favorable cases for B:

- Exactly 2 matches
- Exactly 3 matches
- Exactly 4 matches

So, P(B) = [C(4,2) * C(6,2) + C(4,3) * C(6,1) + C(4,4) * C(6,0)] / C(10,4)

Wait, hold on. Let me think. When she has exactly k matches, the number of ways is C(4,k) * C(6, 4 - k). Because she has to choose k numbers from her 4, and the remaining (4 - k) numbers from the 6 numbers she didn't choose.

Wait, no. Wait, wait. The total numbers she didn't choose are 10 - 4 = 6. So, if she has exactly k matches, that means she has k numbers correct and (4 - k) numbers incorrect. So, the number of favorable combinations is C(4,k) * C(6, 4 - k). So, yes, that's correct.

Therefore, the total number of favorable combinations for B is:

C(4,2)*C(6,2) + C(4,3)*C(6,1) + C(4,4)*C(6,0)

Let me compute each term:

C(4,2)*C(6,2) = 6 * 15 = 90
C(4,3)*C(6,1) = 4 * 6 = 24
C(4,4)*C(6,0) = 1 * 1 = 1

Adding these up: 90 + 24 + 1 = 115

So, P(B) is 115 / 210. Let me simplify that. Divide numerator and denominator by 5: 23/42.

Wait, 115 divided by 5 is 23, and 210 divided by 5 is 42. So, yes, 23/42.

So, now, going back to P(A|B) = P(A)/P(B) = (1/210)/(23/42) = (1/210) * (42/23) = (42)/(210*23) = (1)/(5*23) = 1/115.

Wait, that simplifies to 1/115? Let me check the calculations again.

Wait, 42/210 is 1/5, right? Because 42*5=210. So, yeah, 42/210 is 1/5. So, (1/210) divided by (23/42) is (1/210) * (42/23) = (42)/(210*23) = 1/(5*23) = 1/115.

So, the probability is 1/115, so m=1, n=115. Are they coprime? Yes, since 1 and 115 share no common divisors other than 1.

So, m + n is 1 + 115 = 116.

Wait, but let me double-check everything because sometimes it's easy to make a mistake in combinatorics.

So, the total number of possible draws is C(10,4)=210. Correct.

For exactly k matches, where k=2,3,4:

- Exactly 2 matches: C(4,2)*C(6,2). So, 6 * 15=90. Correct.
- Exactly 3 matches: C(4,3)*C(6,1)=4*6=24. Correct.
- Exactly 4 matches: C(4,4)*C(6,0)=1*1=1. Correct.

Total is 90+24+1=115. So, P(B)=115/210=23/42. Correct.

P(A) is 1/210. So, P(A|B)= (1/210)/(23/42)= (1/210)*(42/23)= (42)/(210*23)= 1/(5*23)=1/115. Correct.

So, yeah, the probability is 1/115, so m + n=1+115=116.

To solve the problem, we need to find the probability that Jen wins the grand prize given that she won a prize. This is a conditional probability problem where event \( A \) is winning the grand prize (all four numbers matching) and event \( B \) is winning a prize (at least two numbers matching).

Using the formula for conditional probability:
\[
P(A|B) = \frac{P(A \cap B)}{P(B)} = \frac{P(A)}{P(B)}
\]
since \( A \) is a subset of \( B \).

1. **Calculate \( P(A) \):**
   - The total number of ways to choose 4 numbers from 10 is \( \binom{10}{4} = 210 \).
   - There is only 1 way for all four numbers to match.
   \[
   P(A) = \frac{1}{210}
   \]

2. **Calculate \( P(B) \):**
   - Jen wins a prize if she has exactly 2, 3, or 4 matches.
   - The number of favorable combinations for each case:
     - Exactly 2 matches: \( \binom{4}{2} \times \binom{6}{2} = 6 \times 15 = 90 \)
     - Exactly 3 matches: \( \binom{4}{3} \times \binom{6}{1} = 4 \times 6 = 24 \)
     - Exactly 4 matches: \( \binom{4}{4} \times \binom{6}{0} = 1 \times 1 = 1 \)
   - Total favorable combinations: \( 90 + 24 + 1 = 115 \)
   \[
   P(B) = \frac{115}{210} = \frac{23}{42}
   \]

3. **Calculate \( P(A|B) \):**
   \[
   P(A|B) = \frac{\frac{1}{210}}{\frac{23}{42}} = \frac{1}{210} \times \frac{42}{23} = \frac{1}{115}
   \]

The probability is \( \frac{1}{115} \), where \( m = 1 \) and \( n = 115 \). Therefore, \( m + n = 1 + 115 = 116 \).

\[
\boxed{116}
\]
