Okay, so I've got this math problem here. It says, let ω not equal to 1 be a 13th root of unity. Then I need to find the remainder when the product from k=0 to 12 of (2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k}) is divided by 1000. Hmm, that's a mouthful. Let me try to break it down.

First, I remember that roots of unity are complex numbers that satisfy ω^n = 1 for some integer n. Since ω is a 13th root of unity and ω ≠ 1, it must be one of the primitive roots. So ω^13 = 1, and the minimal polynomial for ω is the 13th cyclotomic polynomial, which is Φ₁₃(x) = x¹² + x¹¹ + ... + x + 1. Wait, no, actually Φ₁₃(x) is x¹² + x¹¹ + ... + x + 1 because 13 is prime.

But how does that help me here? The product is over k from 0 to 12 of (2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k}). Hmm, okay. Maybe I can find a pattern or simplify the expression inside the product first.

Let me write the general term as 2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k}. Maybe I can factor this or express it in terms of some polynomial. Let me consider it as a quadratic in ω^k. Let's set z = ω^k. Then the term becomes 2 - 2z + z². So the product becomes the product over z of (z² - 2z + 2), where z ranges over all 13th roots of unity except z=1 (since ω ≠ 1, but wait, when k=0, ω^0=1, so does that term include z=1? Wait, the product is from k=0 to 12, so z=ω^0=1 is included. But the problem states ω ≠ 1, but since we're taking all k from 0 to 12, including k=0, so z=1 is included in the product. So maybe I need to reconsider.

So, the product is over all 13th roots of unity, including z=1, of (z² - 2z + 2). So, it's the product of (z² - 2z + 2) for each 13th root of unity z.

Wait, but if I think about polynomials, the product over all roots of a polynomial evaluated at a certain expression can sometimes be related to the polynomial's value or its derivatives. Alternatively, maybe I can think of the product as evaluating a certain polynomial at specific points.

Wait, more specifically, if I have a polynomial P(z) whose roots are all the 13th roots of unity, then P(z) = z¹³ - 1. So, P(z) = (z - 1)(z¹² + z¹¹ + ... + z + 1). But how does that relate to the product we have here?

Our product is over (z² - 2z + 2) for each 13th root z. So, perhaps I can consider the product as the product over all roots of P(z) of (z² - 2z + 2). So, product_{z^13=1} (z² - 2z + 2). 

I remember that for a polynomial Q(z), the product over all roots of P(z) of Q(root) is equal to the resultant of P and Q, or something like that. Alternatively, it might be related to evaluating another polynomial at a certain point.

Wait, another approach: for a polynomial P(z), the product of (z - a_i) where a_i are the roots of P(z) is P(z). But here, we're taking the product of Q(a_i), where Q(z) = z² - 2z + 2. So, product_{i} Q(a_i) = product_{i} (a_i² - 2a_i + 2).

I think there's a formula for this. If P(z) is a monic polynomial with roots a_i, then the product of Q(a_i) for all roots a_i is equal to the resultant of P and Q, which can be computed as the determinant of the Sylvester matrix, but that might be complicated. Alternatively, it's also equal to (-1)^{deg P} times the constant term of Q(z) composed with P(z), but I'm not sure.

Wait, another idea: if I consider the polynomial R(z) = P(z) * Q(z), but that doesn't directly help. Wait, perhaps if I think of it as the product over all roots of P(z) of Q(z), then this is equal to the product Q(z) evaluated at each root, which is the same as the product Q(z) for z^13 = 1.

Alternatively, maybe I can write this product as the resultant of P(z) and Q(z). But I'm not familiar enough with that to compute it directly.

Alternatively, perhaps I can consider that for each root z, z^13 = 1. So, maybe I can express Q(z) = z² - 2z + 2 in terms of z^13. Hmm, not sure.

Wait, let me think about another approach. Let me consider that the product we're looking for is the product over all 13th roots of unity of (z² - 2z + 2). So, that's equal to product_{z^13=1} (z² - 2z + 2). 

Alternatively, I can write this as product_{z^13=1} (z² - 2z + 2) = product_{z^13=1} (z² - 2z + 2). 

But this product can be expressed as the product of Q(z) over all z where z^13 = 1. So, perhaps we can consider that as evaluating the resultant of Q(z) and z^13 - 1.

Wait, the resultant of two polynomials is the product of Q(z) for all roots z of P(z), where P(z) is another polynomial. So yes, in our case, P(z) = z^13 - 1 and Q(z) = z² - 2z + 2. So, the resultant Res(P, Q) is equal to the product of Q(z) for all roots z of P(z).

So, Res(P, Q) = product_{z^13=1} Q(z) = product_{z^13=1} (z² - 2z + 2). Which is exactly the product we're supposed to compute.

Now, the resultant can be computed using the Sylvester matrix, but that might be a bit involved. Alternatively, perhaps another way.

Alternatively, perhaps I can express Q(z) = z² - 2z + 2 as a polynomial in terms of z and z^{-1}, since for roots of unity, z ≠ 0, so z^{-1} = conjugate(z) if z is on the unit circle.

Wait, but perhaps another idea: since z^13 = 1, then z^k = z^{k mod 13}. So, maybe I can express the product as the product over k=0 to 12 of (z² - 2z + 2), where z = ω^k.

Wait, but that's the same as the original problem. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps I can write the product as evaluating another polynomial. For example, product_{k=0}^{12} (2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k}) = product_{k=0}^{12} (ω^{2k} - 2ω^k + 2).

Wait, let me factor this expression. Let me see, can I factor ω^{2k} - 2ω^k + 2? Let me try to see if this factors into something.

Alternatively, perhaps I can write it as (ω^k - a)(ω^k - b), but with real coefficients or something else. Let me compute the discriminant of the quadratic z² - 2z + 2. The discriminant D is 4 - 8 = -4. So, the roots are [2 ± 2i]/2 = 1 ± i. So, the quadratic factors into (z - (1 + i))(z - (1 - i)).

So, Q(z) = (z - (1 + i))(z - (1 - i)). So, product_{z^13=1} Q(z) = product_{z^13=1} (z - (1 + i))(z - (1 - i)).

So, this product is equal to the product over all 13th roots of unity z of (z - (1 + i)) multiplied by the product over all z of (z - (1 - i)). 

But each of these products is equal to the resultant of z^13 - 1 and (z - (1 ± i)). Alternatively, since z^13 - 1 is the polynomial whose roots are the 13th roots of unity, then the product over z of (z - a) is equal to (a^13 - 1), right? Because product_{z^13=1} (z - a) = a^13 - 1. Wait, is that correct? Let me think.

Wait, no. The polynomial z^13 - 1 factors as product_{z^13=1} (z - z'), where z' are the roots. So, more accurately, product_{z^13=1} (z - a) would be evaluated as substituting a into the polynomial? Wait, perhaps it's the other way around.

Wait, let me recall that for a polynomial P(z) = product_{i} (z - a_i), then product_{i} (b - a_i) = P(b). So, in our case, Q(z) = product_{z^13=1} (z - a) = z^13 - 1 evaluated at z=a, which is a^13 - 1. Wait, no, I think it's the other way around.

Wait, perhaps I'm confusing the variables here. Let me think again.

Suppose we have a polynomial P(z) = z^13 - 1, which has roots at all 13th roots of unity. Then, the product over all roots z of P(z) of (z - a) is equal to P(a). Because P(z) = product_{i=0}^{12} (z - ω^i), so substituting z = a gives P(a) = product_{i=0}^{12} (a - ω^i). So, product_{i=0}^{12} (a - ω^i) = a^13 - 1.

So, in our case, we have product_{z^13=1} (z - (1 + i)) = (1 + i)^13 - 1. Similarly, product_{z^13=1} (z - (1 - i)) = (1 - i)^13 - 1.

Therefore, the original product is equal to [(1 + i)^13 - 1] * [(1 - i)^13 - 1]. 

Hmm, that seems manageable. So, let's compute each term separately.

First, compute (1 + i)^13. Let me compute powers of (1 + i). I know that (1 + i)^2 = 1 + 2i + i² = 1 + 2i - 1 = 2i. So, (1 + i)^2 = 2i.

Then, (1 + i)^4 = (2i)^2 = -4.

(1 + i)^8 = (-4)^2 = 16.

(1 + i)^12 = (16)*(2i)^2 = 16*(-4) = -64.

Wait, no, that's not correct. Wait, (1 + i)^1 = 1 + i.

(1 + i)^2 = 2i.

(1 + i)^3 = (1 + i)*(2i) = 2i + 2i² = 2i - 2 = -2 + 2i.

(1 + i)^4 = (-2 + 2i)*(1 + i) = -2(1 + i) + 2i(1 + i) = -2 -2i + 2i + 2i² = -2 + 0i - 2 = -4.

(1 + i)^5 = (1 + i)^4 * (1 + i) = (-4)*(1 + i) = -4 -4i.

(1 + i)^6 = (-4 -4i)*(1 + i) = -4(1 + i) -4i(1 + i) = -4 -4i -4i -4i² = -4 -8i +4 = 0 -8i.

(1 + i)^7 = (-8i)*(1 + i) = -8i -8i² = -8i +8 = 8 -8i.

(1 + i)^8 = (8 -8i)*(1 + i) = 8*(1 + i) -8i*(1 + i) = 8 +8i -8i -8i² = 8 +0i +8 = 16.

(1 + i)^9 = 16*(1 + i) = 16 +16i.

(1 + i)^10 = (16 +16i)*(1 + i) = 16(1 + i) +16i(1 + i) = 16 +16i +16i +16i² = 16 + 32i -16 = 0 +32i.

(1 + i)^11 = 32i*(1 + i) = 32i +32i² = 32i -32.

(1 + i)^12 = (32i -32)*(1 + i) = 32i*(1 +i) -32*(1 +i) = 32i +32i² -32 -32i = 32i -32 -32 -32i = -64.

(1 + i)^13 = (1 + i)^12 * (1 +i) = (-64)*(1 + i) = -64 -64i.

So, (1 + i)^13 = -64 -64i. Therefore, (1 + i)^13 -1 = (-64 -64i) -1 = -65 -64i.

Similarly, let's compute (1 - i)^13.

Compute (1 - i)^13.

Similarly, (1 - i)^2 = 1 -2i +i² = 1 -2i -1 = -2i.

(1 - i)^2 = -2i.

(1 - i)^4 = (-2i)^2 = (-2)^2*(i)^2 = 4*(-1) = -4.

(1 - i)^8 = (-4)^2 = 16.

(1 - i)^12 = (16)*(-2i)^2 = 16*(-4) = -64.

Wait, no, let's compute step by step.

(1 - i)^1 = 1 -i.

(1 - i)^2 = -2i.

(1 - i)^3 = (1 -i)*(-2i) = -2i + 2i² = -2i -2 = -2 -2i.

(1 - i)^4 = (-2 -2i)*(1 -i) = (-2)(1 -i) -2i(1 -i) = -2 +2i -2i +2i² = -2 +0i -2 = -4.

(1 - i)^5 = (-4)*(1 -i) = -4 +4i.

(1 - i)^6 = (-4 +4i)*(1 -i) = -4*(1 -i) +4i*(1 -i) = -4 +4i +4i -4i² = -4 +8i +4 = 0 +8i.

(1 - i)^7 = 8i*(1 -i) = 8i -8i² =8i +8.

(1 - i)^8 = (8 +8i)*(1 -i) =8*(1 -i) +8i*(1 -i) =8 -8i +8i -8i² =8 +0i +8 =16.

(1 - i)^9 =16*(1 -i) =16 -16i.

(1 - i)^10 = (16 -16i)*(1 -i) =16*(1 -i) -16i*(1 -i) =16 -16i -16i +16i² =16 -32i -16=0 -32i.

(1 - i)^11 = (-32i)*(1 -i) =-32i +32i² =-32i -32.

(1 - i)^12 = (-32 -32i)*(1 -i) = -32*(1 -i) -32i*(1 -i) =-32 +32i -32i +32i² =-32 +0i -32 =-64.

(1 - i)^13 = (-64)*(1 -i) =-64 +64i.

So, (1 - i)^13 = -64 +64i. Therefore, (1 -i)^13 -1 = (-64 +64i) -1 = -65 +64i.

So, now the product is [(-65 -64i)] * [(-65 +64i)].

That's a product of a complex number and its conjugate, so it's equal to (-65)^2 + (64)^2.

Compute that: 65² = 4225; 64² =4096. So, 4225 +4096= 8321.

So, the product is 8321.

Wait, but let me double-check that multiplication.

(-65 -64i)(-65 +64i) = (-65)^2 - (64i)^2 = 4225 - (64^2)(i^2) =4225 - (4096)(-1) = 4225 +4096=8321.

Yes, that's correct.

So, the product is 8321.

Wait, but the problem says to find the remainder when this product is divided by 1000. So, 8321 divided by 1000. The remainder is 321.

So, the answer is 321.

Wait, but let me think again. Did I do all the computations correctly? Let me double-check.

First, (1 +i)^13: I computed it step by step up to (1 +i)^13 =-64 -64i. Let me confirm that.

(1 +i)^1 =1 +i.

(1 +i)^2=2i.

(1 +i)^3=(2i)(1 +i)=2i +2i²=2i-2= -2 +2i.

(1 +i)^4=(-2 +2i)(1 +i)= -2(1 +i) +2i(1 +i)= -2 -2i +2i +2i²= -2 +0i -2= -4.

(1 +i)^4 =-4.

(1 +i)^5=(-4)(1 +i)= -4 -4i.

(1 +i)^6=(-4 -4i)(1 +i)= -4(1 +i) -4i(1 +i)= -4 -4i -4i -4i²= -4 -8i +4=0 -8i.

(1 +i)^6= -8i.

(1 +i)^7=(-8i)(1 +i)= -8i -8i²= -8i +8=8 -8i.

(1 +i)^7=8 -8i.

(1 +i)^8=(8 -8i)(1 +i)=8(1 +i) -8i(1 +i)=8 +8i -8i -8i²=8 +0i +8=16.

(1 +i)^8=16.

(1 +i)^9=16(1 +i)=16 +16i.

(1 +i)^10=(16 +16i)(1 +i)=16(1 +i) +16i(1 +i)=16 +16i +16i +16i²=16 +32i -16=32i.

(1 +i)^10=32i.

(1 +i)^11=32i(1 +i)=32i +32i²=32i -32= -32 +32i.

(1 +i)^11= -32 +32i.

(1 +i)^12=(-32 +32i)(1 +i)= -32(1 +i) +32i(1 +i)= -32 -32i +32i +32i²= -32 +0i -32= -64.

(1 +i)^12= -64.

(1 +i)^13=(-64)(1 +i)= -64 -64i.

Yes, that's correct.

Similarly, for (1 -i)^13:

(1 -i)^1=1 -i.

(1 -i)^2= -2i.

(1 -i)^3=(-2i)(1 -i)= -2i + 2i²= -2i -2= -2 -2i.

(1 -i)^4=(-2 -2i)(1 -i)= -2(1 -i) -2i(1 -i)= -2 +2i -2i +2i²= -2 +0i -2= -4.

(1 -i)^4= -4.

(1 -i)^5=(-4)(1 -i)= -4 +4i.

(1 -i)^6=(-4 +4i)(1 -i)= -4(1 -i) +4i(1 -i)= -4 +4i +4i -4i²= -4 +8i +4=0 +8i.

(1 -i)^6=8i.

(1 -i)^7=8i(1 -i)=8i -8i²=8i +8=8 +8i.

(1 -i)^7=8 +8i.

(1 -i)^8=(8 +8i)(1 -i)=8(1 -i) +8i(1 -i)=8 -8i +8i -8i²=8 +0i +8=16.

(1 -i)^8=16.

(1 -i)^9=16(1 -i)=16 -16i.

(1 -i)^10=(16 -16i)(1 -i)=16(1 -i) -16i(1 -i)=16 -16i -16i +16i²=16 -32i -16=0 -32i.

(1 -i)^10= -32i.

(1 -i)^11=(-32i)(1 -i)= -32i +32i²= -32i -32= -32 -32i.

(1 -i)^11= -32 -32i.

(1 -i)^12=(-32 -32i)(1 -i)= -32(1 -i) -32i(1 -i)= -32 +32i -32i +32i²= -32 +0i -32= -64.

(1 -i)^12= -64.

(1 -i)^13=(-64)(1 -i)= -64 +64i.

Yes, that's correct. So, (1 -i)^13= -64 +64i.

Therefore, (1 -i)^13 -1= -65 +64i.

So, the product is (-65 -64i)(-65 +64i)= (-65)^2 - (64i)^2= 4225 - (4096)(-1)=4225 +4096=8321.

Yes, that's 8321.

Now, 8321 divided by 1000 is 8 with a remainder of 321, because 8*1000=8000, and 8321-8000=321.

So, the remainder is 321.

Wait, but just to be thorough, let me check if I made any mistake in the earlier steps. For example, is the product over all 13th roots of (z² -2z +2) equal to product_{z} (z - (1+i))(z - (1 -i)).

Wait, since Q(z) = (z - (1 +i))(z - (1 -i)), then the product over all roots z of (z^13 -1) of Q(z) is equal to the product over all z of (z - (1 +i))(z - (1 -i)).

Which is [ product_{z} (z - (1 +i)) ] * [ product_{z} (z - (1 -i)) ].

And each of these products is equal to (1 +i)^13 -1 and (1 -i)^13 -1, respectively. So, that's correct.

So, the product is indeed [(1 +i)^13 -1] * [(1 -i)^13 -1] = (-65 -64i)(-65 +64i)=8321.

Therefore, the remainder when 8321 is divided by 1000 is 321.

I think that's solid. So, yeah, the answer is 321.

To solve the problem, we need to compute the product \(\prod_{k=0}^{12}(2 - 2\omega^k + \omega^{2k})\) where \(\omega\) is a primitive 13th root of unity, and then find the remainder when this product is divided by 1000.

First, we recognize that \(\omega^k\) for \(k = 0, 1, 2, \ldots, 12\) are all the 13th roots of unity. The given product can be rewritten as \(\prod_{z^{13}=1} (z^2 - 2z + 2)\), where \(z\) ranges over all 13th roots of unity.

Next, we factor the quadratic polynomial \(z^2 - 2z + 2\) as \((z - (1 + i))(z - (1 - i))\). Thus, the product becomes:

\[
\prod_{z^{13}=1} (z - (1 + i))(z - (1 - i)) = \left( \prod_{z^{13}=1} (z - (1 + i)) \right) \left( \prod_{z^{13}=1} (z - (1 - i)) \right)
\]

Each of these products is equivalent to evaluating the polynomial \(z^{13} - 1\) at \(z = 1 + i\) and \(z = 1 - i\), respectively. Therefore, we compute:

\[
(1 + i)^{13} - 1 \quad \text{and} \quad (1 - i)^{13} - 1
\]

Calculating \((1 + i)^{13}\) and \((1 - i)^{13}\) using powers of complex numbers, we find:

\[
(1 + i)^{13} = -64 - 64i \quad \text{and} \quad (1 - i)^{13} = -64 + 64i
\]

Thus:

\[
(1 + i)^{13} - 1 = -65 - 64i \quad \text{and} \quad (1 - i)^{13} - 1 = -65 + 64i
\]

Multiplying these results:

\[
(-65 - 64i)(-65 + 64i) = (-65)^2 + (64)^2 = 4225 + 4096 = 8321
\]

Finally, to find the remainder when 8321 is divided by 1000, we compute:

\[
8321 \mod 1000 = 321
\]

Thus, the remainder is \(\boxed{321}\).
