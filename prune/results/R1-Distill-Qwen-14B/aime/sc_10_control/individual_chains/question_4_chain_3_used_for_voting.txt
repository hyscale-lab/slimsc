Okay, so I have this problem where Alice and Bob are playing a game with a stack of n tokens. They take turns removing either 1 or 4 tokens. Alice goes first, and the person who takes the last token wins. I need to find how many positive integers n ≤ 2024 make Bob the winner, assuming he plays optimally.

Hmm, alright. Let me start by understanding the game mechanics. Each player can take 1 or 4 tokens on their turn. The key here is to find the losing positions for Alice, which would mean Bob can force a win. A losing position is when no matter what move Alice makes, Bob can always respond in a way that leads to Alice's loss.

So, I think I should model this using the concept of "winning" and "losing" positions. Let's denote a position as losing if the player whose turn it is cannot force a win, assuming the opponent plays optimally.

Let's start by analyzing small values of n and see if we can find a pattern.

n=1: Alice takes the 1 token and wins. So, Bob can't win here. So, n=1 is a winning position for Alice.

n=2: Alice can take 1 token, leaving 1 for Bob. Then Bob would take that 1 and win. Wait, but Alice wants to win. Wait, no. Wait, wait. Let me think again.

Wait, the person who takes the last token wins. So, for n=2, Alice's options are:

- Take 1 token, leaving 1 for Bob. Then Bob takes 1 and wins.
- Take 4 tokens: But n=2, so she can't take 4. So, she has to take 1.

Thus, Bob can take the last token and win. So, n=2 is a losing position for Alice, meaning Bob can win. So, n=2 is a losing position for Alice, so Bob can win.

Wait, no. Wait: When n=2, after Alice takes 1, Bob takes 1 and wins. So, if Alice is forced to take 1, then Bob can win. So, n=2 is a losing position for Alice, which is a winning position for Bob.

Wait, but I might be getting confused with the terminology. Let me clarify:

A position is losing if the current player cannot force a win, regardless of the opponent's moves. So, for n=1, Alice can take 1 and win. So, n=1 is a winning position. For n=2, Alice's only move is to take 1, leaving 1 for Bob, who then takes it and wins. So, Alice can't force a win from n=2. So, n=2 is a losing position for Alice.

Similarly, n=3:

Alice can take 1, leaving 2. From n=2, the next player (Bob) is in a losing position, meaning Bob can't win, so Alice can win. Alternatively, if Alice takes 4 from n=3, she can't because 4 >3. So, she takes 1, leaves 2, which is a losing position for Bob. So, n=3 is a winning position for Alice.

n=4: Alice can take 4 tokens and win immediately. So, n=4 is a winning position.

n=5: Alice can take 1, leaving 4 for Bob. Since 4 is a winning position for Bob, he can take 4 and win. Alternatively, Alice could take 4, leaving 1 for Bob, who then takes 1 and wins. So, regardless of Alice's move, Bob can win. So, n=5 is a losing position for Alice, meaning Bob can win.

n=6: Let's see. Alice can take 1, leaving 5. From n=5, we know that it's a losing position for the player whose turn it is. So, if Alice leaves 5 for Bob, Bob is in a losing position, meaning Alice can win. Alternatively, Alice could take 4, leaving 2 for Bob. From n=2, Bob is in a losing position as we saw earlier. So, if Alice takes 4, Bob is left with 2. Wait, but earlier we saw n=2 is a losing position for the player whose turn it is. So, if Alice leaves 2 for Bob, Bob is in a losing position, meaning Alice can win.

Wait, but n=6: If Alice can choose to take 1 or 4, both leading to Bob being in a losing position, then n=6 is a winning position for Alice. So, Bob can't win here.

Wait, but wait. Let me double-check. For n=6:

- If Alice takes 1, n becomes 5, which is a losing position for Bob. So, Bob can't win, meaning Alice can win.
- If Alice takes 4, n becomes 2, which is a losing position for Bob. So, again, Bob can't win.
So, Alice has two options that put Bob in a losing position. So, n=6 is a winning position for Alice, meaning Bob can't win.

Wait, so n=6 is a winning position for Alice. So, Bob can't force a win here.

Hmm, so let's recap:

n : outcome (W for Alice can win, L for Alice can't win, so Bob can win)
1: W
2: L
3: W
4: W
5: L
6: W
7: Let's check n=7.

n=7: Alice can take 1, leaving 6, which is a W position for Bob. So, if Alice takes 1, Bob is in a W position, so Bob can win. Alternatively, Alice can take 4, leaving 3. From n=3, we know it's a W position for Bob. So, Bob can win either way. So, n=7 is a losing position for Alice, so Bob can win.

Wait, wait a minute. Let me think again.

Wait, n=7: If Alice takes 1, n becomes 6, which is a W for Bob. If Alice takes 4, n becomes 3, which is a W for Bob. So, Bob can win in either case. So, n=7 is a losing position for Alice, so Bob can win. So, n=7: L.

n=8: Alice can take 1, leaving 7, which is an L position for Bob. So, Bob is in a losing position. Thus, Alice can win by taking 1. Alternatively, she can take 4, leaving 4, which is a W for Bob. So, if Alice takes 4, Bob can take 4 and win. So, Alice would prefer to take 1, leaving 7, which is L for Bob. So, n=8: W for Alice.

n=9: Alice can take 1, leaving 8 (W for Bob) or 4, leaving 5 (L for Bob). So, if she takes 4, leaving 5, which is an L position for Bob. So, Bob can't win, so Alice can win. So, n=9: W.

n=10: Alice can take 1, leaving 9 (W for Bob), or take 4, leaving 6 (W for Bob). Wait, both moves leave Bob in a W position. So, Alice can't force a win. So, n=10: L.

Wait, but let me check again. For n=10:

- If Alice takes 1, n=9, which is W for Bob. So, Bob can win from 9.
- If Alice takes 4, n=6, which is W for Bob. So, Bob can win from 6.

So, regardless of what Alice does, Bob can win. So, n=10 is L for Alice, so Bob can win.

Hmm, so let's list the outcomes so far:

n : outcome
1: W
2: L
3: W
4: W
5: L
6: W
7: L
8: W
9: W
10: L

Wait, let me see if I can find a pattern. Let's list the losing positions up to n=10: n=2,5,7,10.

Hmm, 2,5,7,10. The differences between these are 3,2,3.

Wait, not sure. Maybe it's a repeating cycle. Let me compute a few more.

n=11:

Alice can take 1, leaving 10 (L for Bob). So, if Alice takes 1, Bob is in L, meaning Alice can win. Alternatively, she can take 4, leaving 7 (L for Bob). So, either way, Alice can leave Bob in a losing position. So, n=11: W.

n=12:

Alice can take 1, leaving 11 (W for Bob) or 4, leaving 8 (W for Bob). So, both moves leave Bob in a W position. So, n=12: L.

Wait, no. Wait, n=12: Alice can take 1, leaving 11 (W for Bob) or 4, leaving 8 (W for Bob). So, both options leave Bob in a W position. So, Bob can win from either 11 or 8. So, n=12 is L for Alice, meaning Bob can win.

Wait, but I thought n=11 is W, so if Alice leaves 11, Bob can win.

Wait, let me think again. For n=12:

If Alice takes 1, leaving 11. From n=11, it's a W for Bob. So, Bob can win from 11.

If Alice takes 4, leaving 8, which is a W for Bob, so Bob can win from 8.

So, no matter what Alice does, Bob can win. So, n=12 is L.

n=13:

Alice can take 1, leaving 12 (L for Bob). So, she can leave Bob in a losing position. So, n=13: W.

n=14:

Alice can take 1, leaving 13 (W for Bob) or 4, leaving 10 (L for Bob). So, if she takes 4, leaving 10, which is L for Bob. So, Alice can win. So, n=14: W.

n=15:

Alice can take 1, leaving 14 (W for Bob) or 4, leaving 11 (W for Bob). So, both options leave Bob in a W position. So, n=15: L.

Wait, so n=15: L.

So, up to n=15, the losing positions are 2,5,7,10,12,15.

Hmm, what's the pattern here? Let me list them:

2,5,7,10,12,15.

Looking at the differences between consecutive terms:

5-2=3

7-5=2

10-7=3

12-10=2

15-12=3

So, the pattern is alternating between adding 3 and 2. So, 2, +3=5, +2=7, +3=10, +2=12, +3=15, and so on.

So, the losing positions are following the pattern where each losing position is 3 more than the previous, then 2 more, then 3, etc.

So, the sequence is 2,5,7,10,12,15,17,20,22,25,27,30, etc.

Wait, so the losing positions are numbers congruent to 2 mod 5? Because 2,5: 2 mod 5 is 2, 5 mod 5 is 0. Hmm, no. Alternatively, maybe it's a cycle of 5 numbers where two are losing positions.

Wait, perhaps it's better to model this using modular arithmetic. Let me think about the possible remainders when n is divided by 5.

Wait, considering that each move can take 1 or 4 tokens, which are 1 and 4 mod 5. So, perhaps the losing positions are when the number of tokens is congruent to 0 mod 5, but looking at our earlier analysis, n=5 is a losing position, n=10 is losing, n=15 is losing, etc. So, n=5k is a losing position.

Wait, but wait. From our earlier analysis, n=2 is a losing position, which is 2 mod 5, not 0. So, that contradicts that idea.

Alternatively, perhaps the losing positions follow a different modulus.

Wait, maybe it's better to model this as a state machine where each state is either a winning (W) or losing (L) position.

Let me try to think of the losing positions as those n where n ≡ 2 mod 5, but that doesn't fit because n=5 is a losing position, which is 0 mod 5.

Wait, maybe the losing positions are every 5 steps starting from 2, but that doesn't fit the pattern either.

Wait, let's see:

Looking at the losing positions:

2,5,7,10,12,15,17,20,22,...

Let me see the differences between them: 3,2,3,2,3,2,3,2,...

So, the pattern alternates adding 3 and 2. So, the sequence is built by alternately adding 3 and 2.

So, starting at 2:

2 +3=5

5 +2=7

7 +3=10

10 +2=12

12 +3=15

15 +2=17

17 +3=20

20 +2=22

22 +3=25

25 +2=27

27 +3=30

and so on.

So, the losing positions can be generated by this sequence.

So, the losing positions are all numbers of the form 5k + 2 and 5k +0? Wait, let's check:

n=2: 5*0 +2=2. Yes.

n=5: 5*1 +0=5.

n=7: 5*1 +2=7.

n=10:5*2 +0=10.

n=12:5*2 +2=12.

n=15:5*3 +0=15.

n=17:5*3 +2=17.

n=20:5*4 +0=20.

Yes, so the losing positions are numbers that are either 0 mod 5 or 2 mod 5.

Wait, because 5k is 0 mod5, and 5k+2 is 2 mod5.

So, the losing positions are n ≡0 mod5 or n≡2 mod5.

Wait, let me check:

n=2: 2 mod5=2 → losing.

n=5:5 mod5=0 → losing.

n=7:7 mod5=2 → losing.

n=10:10 mod5=0 → losing.

n=12:12 mod5=2 → losing.

n=15:15 mod5=0 → losing.

n=17:17 mod5=2 → losing.

Yes, that seems to fit.

So, the losing positions are all numbers where n ≡0 or 2 mod5.

Thus, for any n where n mod5 is 0 or 2, Bob can force a win.

So, the number of such n ≤2024 is the number of integers ≤2024 where n ≡0 or 2 mod5.

So, we can compute this as follows.

First, find how many numbers ≤2024 are ≡0 mod5.

That's floor(2024/5) + (if 2024 is divisible by5, add 1, else 0).

Similarly, numbers ≡2 mod5: same approach.

Calculate the count for each residue.

Total losing positions = count(0 mod5) + count(2 mod5).

Let me compute:

Numbers ≡0 mod5 up to 2024:

The largest multiple of5 ≤2024 is 2024//5=404.8 → 404*5=2020.

So, numbers: 5,10,...,2020. The count is 2020/5=404.

Similarly, numbers ≡2 mod5 up to 2024:

The sequence is 2,7,12,..., up to the largest number ≤2024.

The largest number ≡2 mod5 ≤2024: Let's compute 2024//5=404.8, so 404*5=2020. 2020+2=2022 ≤2024. So, the largest is 2022.

So, the sequence starts at 2, ends at 2022, with step 5.

Number of terms: ((2022 -2)/5) +1 = (2020/5)+1=404+1=405.

So, count for 0 mod5 is 404.

Count for 2 mod5 is 405.

Thus, total losing positions:404 +405=809.

Wait, but let me double-check.

Wait, 2024//5=404.8, so 404*5=2020. So, 2020 is ≡0 mod5.

For 2022=2020+2, which is ≡2 mod5.

So, numbers ≡2 mod5: from 2 to 2022, step5.

Number of terms: Let's compute (2022 -2)/5 +1 = (2020)/5 +1=404+1=405.

Similarly, numbers ≡0 mod5: up to 2020, which is 2020/5=404.

So, total is 404 +405=809.

So, the number of n ≤2024 where Bob can force a win is 809.

Wait, but let me check if 2024 is included. Since 2024 is ≡4 mod5 (since 2024/5=404.8, 5*404=2020, so 2024-2020=4). So, 2024 is not a losing position. So, our count up to 2024 is correct.

So, the answer is 809.

Wait, but wait a second. Let me make sure that the initial analysis is correct. Because sometimes when you model these games, there might be a different pattern.

Wait, let me check n=7 and n=10 again.

n=7: Alice can take 1, leaving 6, which is a winning position for Bob? Wait, earlier I thought n=6 is a winning position for Alice, but that would mean Bob is in a losing position when it's his turn. So, if Alice leaves 6 for Bob, and Bob is in a losing position, then n=7 would be a winning position for Alice. But earlier I thought n=7 was a losing position for Alice. Hmm, this is conflicting.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier in assigning W and L.

Let me re-examine the earlier analysis.

n=1: W

n=2: L

n=3: W

n=4: W

n=5: L

n=6: W

n=7: ?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake when evaluating n=7.

Let me re-examine n=7.

At n=7, Alice can take 1, leaving 6. If n=6 is a W for the player whose turn it is, then Bob would be able to win from n=6, making n=7 a losing position for Alice.

Wait, but earlier I thought n=6 was a W for Alice. Let me check n=6 again.

n=6: Alice can take 1, leaving 5 (L for Bob), so Bob can't win. So, n=6 is a W for Alice.

So, when Alice is at n=7, she can take 1, leaving 6 (W for Bob), which means Bob can win. Alternatively, she can take 4, leaving 3 (W for Bob). Wait, so n=7: if Alice takes 1, Bob is at 6, which is a W position for Bob, meaning Bob can win. If Alice takes 4, Bob is at 3, which is a W position for Bob. So, regardless of Alice's move, Bob can win. So, n=7 is a losing position for Alice.

So, my initial analysis was correct, n=7 is L.

Similarly, n=10: Alice can take 1, leaving 9 (W for Bob). Or take 4, leaving 6 (W for Bob). So, Bob can win. So, n=10 is L.

Thus, the pattern holds. So, the initial analysis is correct.

Therefore, the number of losing positions is 809.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the number of positive integers \( n \leq 2024 \) for which Bob can guarantee a win, we analyze the game using the concept of winning (W) and losing (L) positions. A losing position is one where the current player cannot force a win, regardless of the opponent's moves.

### Key Observations:
1. **Winning and Losing Positions**:
   - A position \( n \) is a losing position if every possible move (taking 1 or 4 tokens) leads to a winning position for the opponent.
   - Conversely, a position is a winning position if there exists at least one move that forces the opponent into a losing position.

2. **Pattern Identification**:
   - By evaluating small values of \( n \), we observe that losing positions occur at \( n \equiv 0 \pmod{5} \) and \( n \equiv 2 \pmod{5} \). This pattern emerges because these positions leave the opponent in a winning state no matter their move.

### Calculation:
- **Numbers \( \equiv 0 \pmod{5} \)**:
  - The largest multiple of 5 less than or equal to 2024 is 2020.
  - Count: \( \left\lfloor \frac{2020}{5} \right\rfloor = 404 \).

- **Numbers \( \equiv 2 \pmod{5} \)**:
  - The sequence starts at 2 and ends at 2022 (since 2022 is the largest number \( \equiv 2 \pmod{5} \) ≤ 2024).
  - Count: \( \left\lfloor \frac{2022 - 2}{5} \right\rfloor + 1 = 405 \).

- **Total Losing Positions**:
  - \( 404 + 405 = 809 \).

Thus, there are **809** positive integers \( n \leq 2024 \) where Bob can guarantee a win.

\boxed{809}
