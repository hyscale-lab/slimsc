Okay, so I've got this probability problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again and make sure I understand what's being asked.

Jen is entering a lottery by picking 4 distinct numbers from the set S = {1,2,3,...,9,10}. Then, 4 numbers are randomly chosen from S. She wins a prize if at least two of her numbers match two of the randomly chosen numbers. She wins the grand prize if all four of her numbers match the four randomly chosen ones. The question is about the probability of her winning the grand prize given that she won a prize. They mention this probability can be expressed as m/n where m and n are coprime, and we need to find m + n.

Alright, so this is a conditional probability problem. The formula for conditional probability is P(A|B) = P(A ∩ B) / P(B), but in this case, if A is "winning the grand prize" and B is "winning a prize", then A is a subset of B because if she wins the grand prize, she must have at least four numbers matching, which means she definitely has at least two matching. So P(A ∩ B) is just P(A). Therefore, the conditional probability is P(A)/P(B).

So, I need to calculate P(A), the probability of winning the grand prize, and P(B), the probability of winning any prize (at least two numbers matching). Then, divide them to get the required probability.

Let's compute these probabilities.

First, the total number of ways to choose 4 numbers from 10 is C(10,4). So, the total possible combinations are C(10,4) = 210.

P(A) is the probability that all four numbers match. Since there's only one such combination (the exact set Jen picked), the number of favorable outcomes is 1. So, P(A) = 1 / C(10,4) = 1/210.

Next, P(B) is the probability of winning a prize, which means at least two of her numbers are among the four chosen. So, the number of favorable outcomes here is the number of ways to choose 4 numbers such that at least two match Jen's numbers.

To compute this, it's sometimes easier to calculate the complement probability and subtract from 1. The complement of winning a prize is having fewer than two matches, i.e., zero or one matches.

The number of ways to choose 4 numbers with zero matches is C(6,4), since Jen has 4 numbers, so the remaining 6 numbers are non-matching. So, C(6,4) = 15.

The number of ways to choose 4 numbers with exactly one match is C(4,1)*C(6,3). That's because we choose 1 number from Jen's 4, and 3 numbers from the remaining 6. C(4,1) is 4, and C(6,3) is 20. So, 4*20=80.

Therefore, the number of ways to not win a prize (i.e., zero or one matches) is 15 + 80 = 95.

So, the number of ways to win a prize is the total combinations minus the non-winning ones: 210 - 95 = 115.

Hence, P(B) = 115 / 210.

Simplify that: 115 and 210 are both divisible by 5. 115 ÷5=23, 210 ÷5=42. So, 23/42.

Wait, that's the probability of B. And P(A) is 1/210.

Wait, but hold on. Wait, P(A) is 1/210, and P(B) is 115/210. So, the conditional probability P(A|B) is (1/210) / (115/210) = (1/210) * (210/115) ) = 1/115.

Wait, that seems too straightforward. Let me double-check.

Wait, another way: the number of favorable outcomes for A is 1, and the number of favorable for B is 115. So, the conditional probability is 1 / 115, which is 1/115. So, m=1, n=115. Wait, but 1 and 115 are coprime, so m + n is 116.

But wait, let me think again. Is that correct? Let me go through the steps again.

Total number of possible 4-number combinations: C(10,4) = 210.

Number of ways to win grand prize: 1. So, P(A) = 1/210.

Number of ways to win a prize (at least two matches):

Alternative approach: this is equal to the sum of the number of ways to have exactly two, exactly three, or exactly four matches.

So, exactly two matches: C(4,2)*C(6,2). That is 6 * 15 = 90.

Exactly three matches: C(4,3)*C(6,1) = 4 *6=24.

Exactly four matches: C(4,4)*C(6,0)=1*1=1.

So, total for winning a prize: 90 +24 +1=115. So, P(B)=115/210=23/42. So, that's same as before.

Therefore, P(A|B)= P(A)/P(B)= (1/210)/(115/210)=1/115.

So, m=1, n=115, which are coprime. So, m + n=116.

Wait, but in the earlier step, I thought the number of ways to win a prize is 115, so the conditional probability is 1/115, so m +n is 116.

But let me just think again: is this correct?

Wait, another way: suppose we're given that at least two numbers matched. So, the conditional probability space is all possible 4-number combinations that have at least two matches with Jen's numbers. The size of this space is 115, as we found. The number of combinations that result in the grand prize is 1. So, the probability is 1/115.

Yes, that seems correct.

So, 1 and 115 are coprime since 115 factors into 5*23, and 1 shares no common factors with them. So, m=1, n=115, and m +n=116.

So, the answer is 116.

Wait, but I just have a feeling that sometimes in these problems, the counts might be different. Let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in computing the number of ways to have at least two matches.

So, for exactly two matches: C(4,2)*C(6,2). 4 choose 2 is 6, 6 choose 2 is 15. 6*15=90.

Exactly three: C(4,3)*C(6,1)=4*6=24.

Exactly four: 1.

Total 90 +24 +1=115. That's correct.

So, B has 115 favorable cases, A is 1, so conditional probability is 1/115.

Yes, so m=1, n=115, m +n=116.

**Final Answer**
\boxed{116}

Jen enters a lottery by picking 4 distinct numbers from the set \( S = \{1, 2, 3, \ldots, 9, 10\} \). Four numbers are randomly chosen from \( S \). She wins a prize if at least two of her numbers match two of the randomly chosen numbers, and wins the grand prize if all four of her numbers match the four randomly chosen ones. We need to find the probability of her winning the grand prize given that she won a prize.

First, we calculate the total number of ways to choose 4 numbers from 10, which is \( \binom{10}{4} = 210 \).

The probability of winning the grand prize \( P(A) \) is the probability that all four numbers match. There is only one such combination, so:
\[ P(A) = \frac{1}{210} \]

Next, we calculate the probability of winning a prize \( P(B) \), which means at least two of her numbers match. We use the complement rule to find the number of ways to choose 4 numbers with fewer than two matches (i.e., zero or one matches).

- The number of ways to choose 4 numbers with zero matches is \( \binom{6}{4} = 15 \).
- The number of ways to choose 4 numbers with exactly one match is \( \binom{4}{1} \binom{6}{3} = 4 \times 20 = 80 \).

Thus, the number of ways to not win a prize is \( 15 + 80 = 95 \). Therefore, the number of ways to win a prize is:
\[ 210 - 95 = 115 \]

So, the probability \( P(B) \) is:
\[ P(B) = \frac{115}{210} = \frac{23}{42} \]

The conditional probability \( P(A|B) \) is given by:
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(A \cap B)}{P(B)} = \frac{P(A)}{P(B)} = \frac{\frac{1}{210}}{\frac{115}{210}} = \frac{1}{115} \]

Thus, the probability is \( \frac{1}{115} \), where \( m = 1 \) and \( n = 115 \). Therefore, \( m + n = 1 + 115 = 116 \).

\[
\boxed{116}
