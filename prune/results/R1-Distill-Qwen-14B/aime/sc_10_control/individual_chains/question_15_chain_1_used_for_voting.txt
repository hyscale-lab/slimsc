Alright, so I've got this problem about counting the number of paths on an 8x8 grid. The paths go from the lower left corner to the upper right corner, have a length of 16, and change direction exactly four times. Hmm, okay, let me try to unpack this step by step.

First, I remember that on a grid, moving from one corner to the opposite typically involves moving right and up. For an 8x8 grid, you have to move 8 steps to the right and 8 steps up, in some order. The total number of such paths without any restrictions is the binomial coefficient C(16,8), which is 12870. But this problem adds some constraints, so I'll need to adjust for that.

The problem says the paths change direction exactly four times. Wait, what does that mean exactly? So, each time you change direction, you switch from moving right to up or up to right. So, if you start moving right, then after some steps you change direction to up, and so on. Each change counts as one direction switch.

Let me think: on a grid path, each time you make a turn, that's a direction change. So, if I have a path that never turns, it's just a straight line, but since we're on a grid, that would mean going all right first then all up, or all up then all right. But those paths change direction only once, right? Because you go right until you can't, then up.

Wait, so the number of direction changes is the number of times you switch from right to up or up to right. So, for a path that goes R, R, U, U, R, R, U, U, etc., each switch from R to U or U to R counts as a direction change.

So, the path starts with either R or U. Let's say it starts with R; then the first move is R, and if it changes direction, it will switch to U, then maybe back to R, and so on. Each time it switches, that's a direction change.

So, the problem wants exactly four such direction changes. So, how many direction changes are possible for a path? Well, the maximum number of direction changes is 15, I think, because each step could potentially alternate direction. But obviously, for our case, it's four.

Wait, but each direction change requires at least one step in each direction. So, for example, if you change direction four times, how does that partition the path into segments?

Hmm, maybe another way to think about it is that each direction change marks the end of a straight segment. So, if you have four direction changes, that would split the path into five straight segments. Because each direction change is between segments.

So, starting direction, then four changes, so five segments total.

Wait, how does that work? Let me see: suppose you start moving right. Then, after some steps, you change direction to up for a segment, then change back to right, etc. So, each direction change adds a new segment. So, direction changes = number of segments minus one.

So, if you have four direction changes, you have five segments. So, the path is made of five straight segments, each either all right or all up, alternating directions.

Wait, but the starting direction could be right or up, so that might affect the count.

So, let's break it down. Each path with four direction changes must have five segments, alternating between right and up moves. Since the grid is 8x8, the total right steps must be 8 and the total up steps must be 8.

So, for the path, each segment is a consecutive series of right or up moves. Each segment must have at least one step, because you can't have a segment of zero steps. So, each of the five segments must have at least one step. But the segments alternate direction, starting with either right or up.

So, let's consider two cases: paths that start with a right move, and paths that start with an up move. Then, in each case, we can model the number of steps in each segment.

Wait, but since the grid is symmetric, maybe the count for starting with right is the same as starting with up, so we can compute one and double it.

Let me try that.

Case 1: Path starts with a right move.

Since we have five segments, starting with right, the direction of the segments will be R, U, R, U, R. So, the directions alternate, starting and ending with R. Hmm, because the number of segments is five, which is odd.

Similarly, Case 2: Path starts with an up move. Then the directions are U, R, U, R, U.

But wait, the direction changes are four, so starting with R, the segments are R, U, R, U, R — that's five segments. So, in this case, the number of right segments and up segments can differ by one.

Specifically, in Case 1, you have three right segments and two up segments. Because starting with R, directions go R, U, R, U, R — so that's three R and two U. Similarly, in Case 2, starting with U, you have three U and two R.

So, for both cases, the number of right segments is three or two, depending on starting direction.

But wait, in Case 1, the starting direction is R, so the number of R segments is three, and U segments is two. Therefore, the total right steps are the sum of the lengths of the three R segments, and the total up steps are the sum of the two U segments.

Similarly, in Case 2, starting with U, the three U segments and two R segments.

But since the grid is 8x8, the total right steps must be 8, and the total up steps must be 8.

So, for Case 1: three R segments with total 8 steps, and two U segments with total 8 steps.

Similarly, for Case 2: three U segments with total 8 steps, and two R segments with total 8 steps.

So, for each case, we can model this as distributing the steps into the segments.

But each segment must have at least one step. So, for Case 1: three R segments, each at least one step, totaling 8. Similarly, two U segments, each at least one step, totaling 8.

So, the number of ways to distribute the steps in the R segments is the number of integer solutions to a + b + c = 8, where a, b, c ≥ 1. That's equivalent to (8-1) choose (3-1) = 7 choose 2 = 21.

Similarly, for the U segments, it's a + b = 8, with a,b ≥1, so (8-1) choose (2-1) = 7 choose 1 =7.

Therefore, the number of ways for Case 1 is 21 * 7 = 147.

Similarly, for Case 2: three U segments, each at least one step, summing to 8. The number of ways is 21. And two R segments, each at least one step, summing to 8: 7. So, 21 *7=147.

Therefore, the total number of paths is 147 + 147 = 294.

Wait, but hold on. Is that all? Let me think again.

Because each direction change corresponds to a segment, and each segment is a straight line. So, for each case, starting with R or U, we calculate the number of distributions and multiply them.

But let me think about the initial assumption. Each direction change is counted as a switch. So, for the path starting with R, the sequence is R, U, R, U, R. So, four direction changes. Similarly for starting with U.

Yes, that's correct. So, the total number is 294.

Wait, but let me double-check my reasoning.

Each path is a sequence of moves, either right or up, with four direction changes, so five segments. Each segment must have at least one step.

Since the grid is 8x8, the total steps right are 8, total up are 8.

For starting with R: three R segments, each at least one step, summing to 8. So, the number of ways to distribute 8 steps into three R segments is C(8-1,3-1)=C(7,2)=21.

Similarly, two U segments, each at least one step: C(8-1,2-1)=C(7,1)=7.

Multiply: 21*7=147.

Same for starting with U: C(7,2)*C(7,1)=147.

Total: 147*2=294.

So, that seems consistent.

Wait, but let me think about the order of the segments. Once we distribute the steps, and assign directions, does the order matter? Or is that already accounted for?

Wait, no, because once you choose the distribution and the starting direction, the order is fixed. So, for starting with R, the segments are R, U, R, U, R, with the step distributions as calculated.

Similarly, starting with U, the segments are U, R, U, R, U.

So, each case is accounted for separately, and the counts are correct.

So, the total number of such paths is 294.

Wait, but let me think again. For the path starting with R, four direction changes would mean you switch four times. So, the sequence is R, U, R, U, R. That's four switches.

But wait, in this case, you have three R segments and two U segments. So, the number of direction changes is equal to the number of switches between R and U, which is four.

Similarly, starting with U, you have three U segments and two R segments, which also gives four direction changes.

Yes, that's correct.

Alternatively, another way to think about it is that the number of direction changes is equal to the number of times the direction switches, which is one less than the number of segments. So, four direction changes mean five segments.

But in this case, since the number of direction changes is even, perhaps? Or is it?

Wait, no, four direction changes can be either starting with R or U, as above.

Wait, but another approach: the number of direction changes is equal to the number of times you switch from R to U or U to R. So, if you have four direction changes, that's equivalent to five runs.

A run is a consecutive sequence of the same move.

So, in combinatorics, the number of ways to have a certain number of runs (here, five runs) with the constraints on the total steps.

Wait, but in our case, the runs are alternating between R and U, starting with either R or U.

So, for five runs, starting with R, you have three R runs and two U runs.

Similarly, starting with U, you have three U runs and two R runs.

So, in each case, the number of ways is the number of compositions of 8 into three parts (for R) multiplied by the number of compositions of 8 into two parts (for U), and vice versa.

Which is exactly what I did earlier.

So, that gives 21*7 + 21*7 = 294.

So, that seems consistent.

Wait, but let me confirm with a smaller grid to see if this approach works.

Suppose I have a 2x2 grid, and I want to count the number of paths that change direction exactly twice.

So, the total steps needed are 4 (2 right, 2 up). The path must change direction twice.

So, according to the same reasoning, the number of direction changes is two, which would correspond to three segments.

So, starting with R: three segments, R, U, R.

So, the number of ways to distribute 2 R steps into two R runs: wait, no, starting with R, two R runs? Wait, no, if direction changes twice, then the number of segments is three.

Wait, in a 2x2 grid, the path must go from (0,0) to (2,2). Let's say it changes direction twice.

So, starting with R, the path would have runs R, U, R, or starting with U, runs U, R, U.

Wait, but for a 2x2 grid, let's see:

Case 1: Start with R.

So, R, U, R.

Each R run must have at least one R, and U run must have at least one U.

So, for R runs: two runs, each ≥1, sum to 2: number of ways C(2-1,2-1)=1. So, both R runs are 1 step each.

Similarly, the U run: one run, must be 2 steps: only 1 way.

So, the number of paths starting with R is 1*1=1.

Similarly, starting with U: two U runs, each ≥1, sum to 2: only 1 way, and one R run, 2 steps: only 1 way. So, 1*1=1.

Total paths: 2.

But in reality, how many paths are there with exactly two direction changes in a 2x2 grid?

Let me list them:

1. R, R, U, U: one direction change (from R to U). So, that's only one direction change, not two.

2. R, U, R, U: two direction changes.

3. R, U, U, R: two direction changes.

4. U, R, R, U: two direction changes.

5. U, R, U, R: two direction changes.

6. U, U, R, R: one direction change.

Wait, so total of four paths with exactly two direction changes.

But according to my earlier method, it's 2. So, that's a discrepancy.

Hmm, so perhaps my initial approach is incorrect.

Wait, what's the issue here?

In the 2x2 grid, the number of direction changes is equal to the number of times the direction switches.

So, for a path like R, U, R, U, the direction changes occur after the first R, then after the U, then after the R. So, three direction changes? Wait, no.

Wait, actually, the number of direction changes is the number of times the direction switches.

So, in the path R, U, R, U, the direction changes after the first step (R→U), then after the second step (U→R), then after the third step (R→U). So, three direction changes.

Wait, that's three. But in a 2x2 grid, the path has four steps. So, how many direction changes can you have?

Wait, each step is either R or U. So, the direction can change after each step. So, for four steps, you can have up to three direction changes.

Wait, but in the 2x2 grid, the maximum number of direction changes is three, which would be R, U, R, U or U, R, U, R.

Wait, but the problem I was trying to solve earlier was for two direction changes. So, how many paths have exactly two direction changes.

Wait, in my earlier example, I listed some paths as having two direction changes, but maybe I was wrong.

Wait, let's clarify:

- Path R, R, U, U: only one direction change (after two steps).

- Path R, U, R, U: three direction changes.

Wait, no, that's four steps:

Step 1: R

Step 2: U (direction change 1)

Step 3: R (direction change 2)

Step 4: U (direction change 3)

So, that path has three direction changes.

Similarly, path R, U, U, R: direction changes after step 1 (R→U), step 3 (U→R). So, two direction changes.

Similarly, U, R, R, U has two direction changes.

Wait, so in that case, the number of paths with exactly two direction changes in a 2x2 grid is two.

Wait, but earlier I thought there were four. Hmm, confusion arises from how direction changes are counted.

So, perhaps in the 2x2 grid, the number of direction changes is equal to the number of times the direction switches, which for a four-step path can be 0, 1, 2, or 3.

But wait, in this case, the maximum direction changes is three, as in R, U, R, U.

Wait, so for two direction changes, let's see:

How many paths have exactly two direction changes.

In the 2x2 grid:

1. R, U, U, R: direction changes after step 1 and step 3.

2. U, R, R, U: direction changes after step 1 and step 3.

3. R, R, U, U: direction change after step 2.

Wait, no, that's only one direction change.

Wait, no, the path R, U, U, R: direction changes after first step (R→U), then after third step (U→R). So, two direction changes.

Similarly, R, U, R, U has three direction changes.

So, in the 2x2 grid, how many paths have exactly two direction changes?

They are:

- R, U, U, R.

- U, R, R, U.

- R, R, U, U: one direction change.

Wait, no, R, R, U, U has only one direction change.

Wait, maybe I'm getting confused.

Wait, the number of direction changes is equal to the number of times the direction switches. So, for a path like R, U, U, R:

- After the first step (R), direction changes to U. So, that's one change.

- Then, after the third step (U), direction changes to R. That's the second change.

So, total two direction changes.

Similarly, U, R, R, U:

- After first step U, change to R: first change.

- After third step R, change to U: second change.

So, two direction changes.

What about R, U, R, U:

- After step 1: R→U (1st change).

- Step 3: U→R (2nd change).

- Step 4: R→U (3rd change). So, three direction changes.

Wait, so in the 2x2 grid, how many paths have exactly two direction changes?

Two: R, U, U, R and U, R, R, U.

Therefore, in the 2x2 grid, the number is two.

But according to my initial approach:

Number of direction changes is two, which implies three segments.

So, starting with R: three segments, R, U, R.

Each R run must have at least one step, so distributing 2 R steps into two runs: C(2-1,2-1)=1 way.

Distributing 2 U steps into one run: only 1 way.

So, 1*1=1 path starting with R.

Similarly, starting with U: three U segments? Wait, no.

Wait, in the 2x2 grid, starting with U, three U segments would require distributing 2 U steps into three runs, which isn't possible because each run must have at least one step, and 3 runs would require at least 3 steps, but we only have 2. So, that's impossible.

Wait, so starting with U in this case would require more U steps than available. So, perhaps in the 2x2 grid, you can't have a path starting with U, with three U segments and two R segments, because you only have 2 U steps. So, three U segments would require at least 3 U steps, which is not possible.

So, in this case, starting with R: 1 path.

Starting with U: impossible, since you can't have three U segments with only two U steps.

Thus, total paths: 1.

But earlier, we saw that there are two paths with exactly two direction changes.

So, this suggests that my initial approach is incorrect.

Hmm, what's the issue here?

Wait, perhaps the problem is that when the number of direction changes is four in the 8x8 grid, but in the 2x2 grid, four direction changes isn't possible because of the grid size.

Wait, but in the 2x2 grid, two direction changes are possible, but according to my initial approach, starting with R, I get one path, starting with U, impossible, so total 1, but actual count is two.

So, my initial approach is flawed.

Hmm, so perhaps I need a different approach.

Wait, maybe another way to model this is to think of the number of direction changes as the number of times the direction is switched, which is equal to the number of runs minus one.

In our problem, for an 8x8 grid, the path has 16 steps, 8 R and 8 U. We want the number of such paths with exactly four direction changes, which implies five runs.

Each run is a consecutive sequence of R or U.

So, the number of runs is five.

So, the number of runs can be either starting with R or starting with U.

If it starts with R, then the runs are R, U, R, U, R: three R runs and two U runs.

Similarly, starting with U: three U runs and two R runs.

So, the number of such paths is equal to the number of ways to distribute the R steps into three runs, each at least one, multiplied by the number of ways to distribute the U steps into two runs, each at least one, plus the same starting with U.

Wait, that's exactly what I did earlier, so for the 8x8 grid, it's 21*7*2=294.

But in the 2x2 grid, starting with R: three R runs and two U runs.

But in the 2x2 grid, starting with R, you have to distribute 2 R steps into three runs, which is impossible, because 3 runs would require at least 3 R steps, but you only have 2. So, it's zero.

Similarly, starting with U: three U runs, two U steps: impossible.

But wait, in the 2x2 grid, the two paths with two direction changes are R, U, U, R and U, R, R, U.

So, in each case, the number of runs is three.

Wait, R, U, U, R: runs are R, U, R → three runs.

Similarly, U, R, R, U: runs are U, R, U → three runs.

So, for two direction changes, the number of runs is three.

Which is consistent with what I thought before: direction changes = runs -1.

But in the 2x2 grid, for two direction changes, you have three runs, but distributing the steps.

So, starting with R: three runs: R, U, R.

But in this case, the R runs must sum to 2, with two runs (first and third).

Wait, no, no, three runs, starting with R, so R, U, R.

So, two R runs and one U run.

Wait, that would mean distributing 2 R steps into two runs, each ≥1: C(2-1,2-1)=1 way.

And distributing 2 U steps into one run: only 1 way.

So, 1*1=1 path starting with R.

Similarly, starting with U: three runs: U, R, U.

So, two U runs and one R run.

Distribute 2 U steps into two runs: 1 way.

Distribute 2 R steps into one run: 1 way.

So, 1*1=1 path starting with U.

Thus, total paths: 1+1=2, which matches the actual count.

Wait, so in the 2x2 grid, the count is 2.

So, perhaps my initial approach is correct, but in the 8x8 grid, it's 21*7*2=294.

Wait, but why did I get a different result earlier? Because in the 2x2 grid, the starting direction affects the counts, but in the 8x8 grid, both starting directions are possible.

Wait, so perhaps my initial conclusion is correct.

Wait, so in the 2x2 grid, the number of paths with exactly two direction changes is two, which is 2. And according to the formula:

For starting with R: C(2-1,2-1) * C(2-1,1-1) =1 *1=1.

Similarly, starting with U:1*1=1.

Total:2.

Which is correct.

So, perhaps my approach is correct.

Wait, but for the 8x8 grid, the number of direction changes is four, leading to five runs.

So, for starting with R, three R runs and two U runs.

Number of ways: C(8-1,3-1) * C(8-1,2-1) = C(7,2)*C(7,1)=21*7=147.

Similarly, starting with U: same thing, 147.

Total: 294.

So, perhaps the initial approach is correct, and the 2x2 example was just a check.

So, perhaps the answer is 294.

But wait, let me think again.

Wait, another way: each direction change corresponds to a switch, and the number of direction changes is four, so the number of runs is five.

So, in the 8x8 grid, the number of such paths is given by:

If starting with R: the number of compositions of 8 into three parts (R runs) multiplied by the number of compositions of 8 into two parts (U runs).

Similarly, starting with U: same for U and R.

So, it's 2 * [C(7,2) * C(7,1)].

Which is 2*21*7=294.

So, yes, that's consistent.

Therefore, I think the answer is 294.

But wait, another thought: are we overcounting any paths?

Wait, because in this model, each path is uniquely determined by the number of steps in each run, and the starting direction.

So, for starting with R, the run lengths are uniquely determined, so each path is counted once.

Similarly for starting with U.

So, no overcounting.

Therefore, the total is 294.

But let me think of another way.

Alternatively, the number of paths with exactly four direction changes is equal to the number of ways to arrange the runs.

Since four direction changes correspond to five runs.

The number of such paths is 2 * C(7,2) * C(7,1).

Which is 2*21*7=294.

So, I think I'm confident now. The answer is 294.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To solve the problem of counting the number of paths of length 16 on an 8×8 grid that change direction exactly four times, we analyze the structure of such paths. Each path consists of 8 right (R) and 8 up (U) moves, arranged in segments that alternate directions. A direction change occurs when the path switches from R to U or U to R. 

With exactly four direction changes, the path is divided into five segments. These segments alternate between R and U, starting with either R or U. Thus, there are two cases to consider:

1. **Starting with R**: The path has three R segments and two U segments.
2. **Starting with U**: The path has three U segments and two R segments.

For each case, we distribute the 8 R or U steps into the required number of segments, ensuring each segment has at least one step. This is equivalent to finding the number of compositions of 8 into a given number of parts, which can be calculated using combinations.

- For three R segments (Case 1), the number of compositions is \( \binom{7}{2} = 21 \).
- For two U segments (Case 1), the number of compositions is \( \binom{7}{1} = 7 \).
- Similarly, for three U segments (Case 2), the number of compositions is \( \binom{7}{2} = 21 \).
- For two R segments (Case 2), the number of compositions is \( \binom{7}{1} = 7 \).

Thus, the number of paths for each case is \( 21 \times 7 = 147 \). Since there are two cases (starting with R or U), the total number of paths is:

\[
147 \times 2 = 294
\]

Therefore, the number of paths that change direction exactly four times is:

\boxed{294}
