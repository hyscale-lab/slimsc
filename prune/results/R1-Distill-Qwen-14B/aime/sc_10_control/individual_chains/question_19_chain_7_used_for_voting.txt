Okay, so I'm trying to solve this geometry problem about triangle ABC. Let me read the problem again and make sure I understand all the given information.

We have triangle ABC with circumcenter O and incenter I. It's given that IA is perpendicular to OI. The circumradius is 13, and the inradius is 6. We need to find the product AB·AC.

Hmm, okay. So let's jot down the given information:

1. Triangle ABC with circumradius (R) = 13. So the circumcircle has a radius of 13.
2. Inradius (r) = 6. The inradius is the radius of the incircle.
3. IA is perpendicular to OI. So the line from incenter I to vertex A is perpendicular to the line from circumcenter O to incenter I.

We need to find AB multiplied by AC.

Let me recall some properties and formulas related to triangle centers and radii.

First, the circumradius R is related to the sides of the triangle. The formula for the circumradius is R = (a b c) / (4Δ), where a, b, c are the sides, and Δ is the area.

The inradius r is related to the area and the semiperimeter. The formula is r = Δ / s, where s is the semiperimeter.

Also, the distance between the incenter and circumcenter, OI, can be found using the formula OI² = R(R - 2r). Wait, is that correct? Let me remember. Yes, Euler's formula states that OI² = R(R - 2r). So that's a useful formula here.

Given that IA is perpendicular to OI, perhaps I can use coordinate geometry or vector methods, but maybe there's a more straightforward approach using triangle properties.

Alternatively, maybe I can relate this perpendicularity condition to some trigonometric identities or properties.

Let me think about the incenter I and the circumcenter O. The incenter is the intersection of the angle bisectors, and the circumcenter is the intersection of the perpendicular bisectors.

Given that IA is perpendicular to OI, that seems like a specific condition. Maybe I can express this in terms of vectors or coordinates.

Wait, maybe if I place the triangle in a coordinate system, it might simplify things. Let me try that.

Let me assume point A is at (0,0), and the incenter I is somewhere in the plane. Since IA is perpendicular to OI, maybe I can set up some coordinates such that this condition is satisfied.

But before diving into coordinates, perhaps there's a trigonometric relationship I can use.

I remember that in a triangle, the distance from the incenter to a vertex can be expressed in terms of the sides and angles. Specifically, the length of IA can be expressed as IA = r / sin(A/2), where r is the inradius and A is the angle at vertex A.

Wait, is that correct? Let me think. The distance from the incenter I to vertex A can be found using the formula IA = (r) / sin(A/2). Yes, I think that's right because in the triangle formed by the inradius and the angle bisector, the distance IA is the hypotenuse, and r is the opposite side to angle A/2.

So IA = r / sin(A/2) = 6 / sin(A/2).

Similarly, the distance from the incenter to the circumradius is given by OI² = R(R - 2r) = 13(13 - 12) = 13(1) = 13. So OI = √13.

So OI is √13, and IA is 6 / sin(A/2). Also, IA is perpendicular to OI.

Hmm, so we have two lines, IA and OI, which are perpendicular. So perhaps we can use the Pythagorean theorem in triangle OIA.

Wait, triangle OIA: OI is one leg, IA is another leg, and OA is the hypotenuse? Wait, but OA is the circumradius, so OA = R = 13.

Wait, is that correct? Let me think. Point O is the circumcenter, so OA is the radius of the circumcircle, which is 13. Point I is the incenter. So triangle OIA has sides OI, IA, and OA. Since IA is perpendicular to OI, triangle OIA is a right-angled triangle with right angle at I.

So, by the Pythagorean theorem:

OA² = OI² + IA²

We know OA = 13, OI = √13, so plug in:

13² = (√13)² + IA²

169 = 13 + IA²

IA² = 169 -13 = 156

So IA = sqrt(156) = 2*sqrt(39).

But earlier, I thought IA = 6 / sin(A/2). So:

6 / sin(A/2) = sqrt(156)

So sin(A/2) = 6 / sqrt(156) = 6 / (2*sqrt(39)) = 3 / sqrt(39) = 3√39 / 39 = √39 / 13.

Wait, let me compute that again.

6 / sqrt(156) = 6 / (√(4*39)) = 6 / (2√39) ) = 3 / √39.

Rationalizing the denominator:

3 / √39 = (3√39) / 39 = √39 / 13.

So sin(A/2) = √39 / 13.

Okay, now I can find cos(A/2) using the identity sin²θ + cos²θ =1.

So cos(A/2) = sqrt(1 - sin²(A/2)) = sqrt(1 - (39/169)) = sqrt(130/169) = sqrt(130)/13.

So, now I have sin(A/2) and cos(A/2). Maybe I can find angle A.

But perhaps another approach is needed. Let's see.

We need to find AB·AC. Let's denote AB = c, AC = b, BC = a.

We can recall that in a triangle, AB·AC can be expressed in terms of the sides and angles. Using the formula:

AB·AC = 2Δ / sin A

Wait, because area Δ = (1/2)ab sin C, but in this case, AB·AC would be c·b.

Wait, actually, in triangle ABC, AB = c, AC = b, so AB·AC = b c.

Alternatively, using the formula for area Δ = (1/2)ab sin C, but I'm not sure if that directly helps here.

Wait, another formula: In any triangle, the product of two sides is equal to 2R times the product of the circumradius and the sine of the included angle.

Wait, actually, the Law of Sines says that a / sin A = 2R. So, a = 2R sin A, b = 2R sin B, c = 2R sin C.

So, AB = c = 2R sin C, AC = b = 2R sin B.

So, AB·AC = (2R sin C)(2R sin B) = 4 R² sin B sin C.

Hmm, but I don't know angles B and C. Maybe I can relate this to other quantities.

Alternatively, the product AB·AC can be expressed in terms of the semiperimeter s, inradius r, and other terms.

Wait, another formula: In a triangle, the product AB·AC can be expressed as (b c). Let me think about other relations.

We also know that in a triangle, the area Δ = r s, where s is the semiperimeter, and also Δ = (a b c) / (4 R).

So, (a b c)/(4 R) = r s.

But we're supposed to find b c. So, if I can find b c, that's what we need.

Alternatively, perhaps I can find expressions for b and c in terms of the given data.

Wait, let me think about other relationships. The inradius is r = 6, and the semiperimeter s = (a + b + c)/2.

Also, we have formulas involving the exradius and other properties, but maybe that's too complicated.

Wait, let's go back to the right triangle OIA. We found that IA = sqrt(156) = 2 sqrt(39), and we found that sin(A/2) = sqrt(39)/13, cos(A/2) = sqrt(130)/13.

Another formula for IA: IA = (r) / sin(A/2) = 6 / sin(A/2). So that's consistent with what we have.

Wait, maybe I can find angle A.

We have sin(A/2) = sqrt(39)/13.

So, A/2 = arcsin(sqrt(39)/13). Let's compute this angle.

Compute sqrt(39): sqrt(39) ≈ 6.245, but exact value is irrational. But perhaps we can find cos A or sin A.

Alternatively, using double angle formulas.

We can compute cos A using cos A = 1 - 2 sin²(A/2) = 1 - 2*(39/169) = 1 - 78/169 = (169 -78)/169 = 91/169 = 7*13 / 13² = 7/13.

Wait, wait, cos A = 1 - 2 sin²(A/2)

So, sin(A/2) = sqrt(39)/13, so sin²(A/2) = 39/169.

Then cos A = 1 - 2*(39/169) = 1 - 78/169 = (169 -78)/169 = 91/169 = 7*13 / 13² = 7/13.

So cos A = 7/13.

Great, so cos A = 7/13. Then, sin A can be found using sin² A + cos² A =1.

So sin A = sqrt(1 - (49/169)) = sqrt(120/169) = 2*sqrt(30)/13.

So sin A = 2 sqrt(30)/13.

Now, let's think about the area of the triangle.

The area can be expressed as Δ = (1/2)ab sin C, but perhaps it's more useful to use Δ = r s and Δ = (a b c)/(4 R).

We have r =6, R=13, so if we can find s, the semiperimeter, or the sides a, b, c, that could help.

Alternatively, since we know angle A and sin A, perhaps we can express sides b and c in terms of the other variables.

Wait, if I can find sides b and c, then b*c is what we need.

Wait, from Law of Sines, a = 2 R sin A = 2*13*(2 sqrt(30)/13) = 4 sqrt(30).

So side a (BC) is 4 sqrt(30).

So, a = 4 sqrt(30).

We can also relate the sides using the inradius formula.

We know that r = Δ / s, so Δ = r s =6 s.

Also, Δ = (a b c)/(4 R) = (4 sqrt(30) * b * c)/(4*13) = (sqrt(30) b c)/13.

So, Δ = (sqrt(30) b c)/13.

But Δ is also 6 s, so 6 s = (sqrt(30) b c)/13.

So, 6 s = (sqrt(30) b c)/13.

We can write this as:

b c = (6 s *13)/sqrt(30) = (78 s)/sqrt(30).

But we need to find b c. Hmm, not sure if this helps yet.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use the formula for the area in terms of the inradius and semiperimeter.

Also, another formula: tan(A/2) = r / (s - a).

Wait, yes, tan(A/2) = r / (s - a).

We have tan(A/2) = [sin(A/2)/cos(A/2)] = [sqrt(39)/13] / [sqrt(130)/13] = sqrt(39)/sqrt(130) = sqrt(39/130) = sqrt(3/10).

So tan(A/2) = sqrt(3/10).

But tan(A/2) is also equal to r / (s - a).

So, sqrt(3/10) = 6 / (s - a).

So, (s - a) = 6 / sqrt(3/10) = 6 * sqrt(10/3) = 6 sqrt(10)/sqrt(3) = 6 sqrt(30)/3 = 2 sqrt(30).

So, s - a = 2 sqrt(30).

But s is the semiperimeter, so s = (a + b + c)/2.

We know a =4 sqrt(30). So,

s = (4 sqrt(30) + b + c)/2.

So, s - a = (4 sqrt(30) + b + c)/2 - 4 sqrt(30) = [4 sqrt(30) + b + c - 8 sqrt(30)] / 2 = (b + c -4 sqrt(30))/2.

But we found s - a = 2 sqrt(30). So,

(b + c -4 sqrt(30))/2 = 2 sqrt(30).

Multiply both sides by 2:

b + c -4 sqrt(30) = 4 sqrt(30).

So,

b + c = 8 sqrt(30).

Okay, so we have that the sum of sides b and c is 8 sqrt(30).

Now, we also have another relation from the area.

We had earlier that 6 s = (sqrt(30) b c)/13.

We can express s as (a + b + c)/2 = (4 sqrt(30) + b + c)/2 = (4 sqrt(30) +8 sqrt(30))/2 = (12 sqrt(30))/2 = 6 sqrt(30).

Wait, because earlier we found that b + c =8 sqrt(30), and a is 4 sqrt(30). So, s = (4 sqrt(30) + 8 sqrt(30))/2 = 12 sqrt(30)/2 =6 sqrt(30).

So s =6 sqrt(30).

Then, 6 s =6 *6 sqrt(30)=36 sqrt(30).

But we also have 6 s = (sqrt(30) b c)/13.

So,

36 sqrt(30) = (sqrt(30) b c)/13.

Divide both sides by sqrt(30):

36 = (b c)/13.

Multiply both sides by 13:

b c = 36 *13=468.

So, AB·AC =b c=468.

So, the answer is 468.

Wait, let me double-check to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.

We know that a=4 sqrt(30), s=6 sqrt(30), b + c=8 sqrt(30).

We found that b c=468.

Let me verify using another formula.

We can also compute the area in two ways.

First, Δ = r s =6 *6 sqrt(30)=36 sqrt(30).

Alternatively, Δ = (a b c)/(4 R) = (4 sqrt(30) * b * c)/(4*13)= (sqrt(30) * b c)/13.

Set them equal:

36 sqrt(30) = (sqrt(30) * b c)/13.

Solving for b c gives b c=36 sqrt(30)*13 / sqrt(30)=36 *13=468.

Yes, that's correct.

So, AB·AC=468.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To solve the problem, we start by noting the given information: the circumradius \( R = 13 \), the inradius \( r = 6 \), and \( \overline{IA} \perp \overline{OI} \). We aim to find \( AB \cdot AC \).

Using Euler's formula, the distance between the circumcenter \( O \) and incenter \( I \) is given by:
\[
OI^2 = R(R - 2r) = 13(13 - 12) = 13
\]
Thus, \( OI = \sqrt{13} \).

Since \( \overline{IA} \perp \overline{OI} \), triangle \( OIA \) is a right triangle with \( OA = R = 13 \) as the hypotenuse. Applying the Pythagorean theorem:
\[
OA^2 = OI^2 + IA^2 \implies 13^2 = (\sqrt{13})^2 + IA^2 \implies 169 = 13 + IA^2 \implies IA^2 = 156 \implies IA = \sqrt{156} = 2\sqrt{39}
\]

The length \( IA \) can also be expressed as \( IA = \frac{r}{\sin(A/2)} \). Substituting \( r = 6 \) and \( IA = 2\sqrt{39} \):
\[
2\sqrt{39} = \frac{6}{\sin(A/2)} \implies \sin(A/2) = \frac{6}{2\sqrt{39}} = \frac{3}{\sqrt{39}} = \frac{\sqrt{39}}{13}
\]

Using the identity \( \cos(A/2) = \sqrt{1 - \sin^2(A/2)} \):
\[
\cos(A/2) = \sqrt{1 - \left(\frac{\sqrt{39}}{13}\right)^2} = \sqrt{\frac{130}{169}} = \frac{\sqrt{130}}{13}
\]

Next, we find \( \cos A \) using the double-angle formula:
\[
\cos A = 1 - 2\sin^2(A/2) = 1 - 2\left(\frac{39}{169}\right) = 1 - \frac{78}{169} = \frac{91}{169} = \frac{7}{13}
\]

The side \( a = BC \) opposite angle \( A \) is found using the Law of Sines:
\[
a = 2R \sin A = 2 \times 13 \times \frac{2\sqrt{30}}{13} = 4\sqrt{30}
\]

The semiperimeter \( s \) is:
\[
s = \frac{a + b + c}{2}
\]
Using the relationship \( s - a = 2\sqrt{30} \) (derived from \( \tan(A/2) = \frac{r}{s - a} \)), we find:
\[
s = 6\sqrt{30}
\]

The area \( \Delta \) of the triangle is:
\[
\Delta = r \cdot s = 6 \times 6\sqrt{30} = 36\sqrt{30}
\]

Using the area formula \( \Delta = \frac{abc}{4R} \):
\[
36\sqrt{30} = \frac{a \cdot b \cdot c}{4 \times 13} \implies 36\sqrt{30} = \frac{4\sqrt{30} \cdot b \cdot c}{52} \implies 36\sqrt{30} = \frac{\sqrt{30} \cdot b \cdot c}{13}
\]
Solving for \( b \cdot c \):
\[
b \cdot c = 36 \times 13 = 468
\]

Thus, the product \( AB \cdot AC = b \cdot c = 468 \).

\[
\boxed{468}
\]
