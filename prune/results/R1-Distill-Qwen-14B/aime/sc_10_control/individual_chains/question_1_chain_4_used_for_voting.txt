Okay, so I have this problem with logarithms and three variables x, y, z. The equations given are all logarithms base 2, which is good because it might make things a bit simpler. The goal is to find |log₂(x⁴y³z²)| and express it as a fraction m/n where m and n are coprime, then find m + n. 

Let me write down the equations first to get a clear picture.

1. log₂(x / (y z)) = 1/2
2. log₂(y / (x z)) = 1/3
3. log₂(z / (x y)) = 1/4

Hmm. So each equation is a logarithm of a ratio of one variable over the product of the other two. Since all the logs are base 2, maybe I can convert these into exponential form to make them easier to handle.

Starting with the first equation: log₂(x / (y z)) = 1/2. Converting that, it becomes x / (y z) = 2^(1/2), which is sqrt(2). So x = y z * sqrt(2). Let me write that down:

x = y z * 2^(1/2)  ...(1)

Similarly, the second equation: log₂(y / (x z)) = 1/3. Converting, y / (x z) = 2^(1/3). So y = x z * 2^(1/3). Let me note that:

y = x z * 2^(1/3)  ...(2)

Third equation: log₂(z / (x y)) = 1/4. So z / (x y) = 2^(1/4), which implies z = x y * 2^(1/4). So:

z = x y * 2^(1/4)  ...(3)

Now I have three equations, each expressing one variable in terms of the other two and a power of 2. Maybe I can substitute these equations into each other to find expressions for x, y, z in terms that can be solved.

Let me see. From equation (1), x is expressed in terms of y and z. From equation (2), y is expressed in terms of x and z. But since equation (1) has x in terms of y and z, perhaps I can substitute equation (2) into equation (1) to express x in terms of z and then substitute into equation (3), or something like that.

Wait, maybe it's better to express all variables in terms of one variable. Let me try expressing y and z in terms of x, then substitute back.

Wait, actually, maybe another approach. Let me take all three equations and express the ratios. Let me see:

From equation (1): x / (y z) = 2^(1/2)  ...(1a)

From equation (2): y / (x z) = 2^(1/3)  ...(2a)

From equation (3): z / (x y) = 2^(1/4)  ...(3a)

If I multiply all three equations together, I get:

(x / (y z)) * (y / (x z)) * (z / (x y)) = 2^(1/2) * 2^(1/3) * 2^(1/4)

Simplify the left side:

The numerator is x * y * z. The denominator is y z * x z * x y.

Wait, let me compute step by step.

First, each fraction:

First term: x/(y z)
Second term: y/(x z)
Third term: z/(x y)

Multiply them:

(x/(y z)) * (y/(x z)) * (z/(x y)) ) = (x * y * z) / (y z * x z * x y)

Simplify numerator and denominator:

Numerator: x y z

Denominator: y z * x z * x y = (y z)(x z)(x y) = x^2 y^2 z^2

Wait, no. Let me compute the denominator step by step:

(y z) * (x z) * (x y) = y z * x z * x y

Group the terms:

= (y * x * x) * (z * z) * y
Wait, no. Let me think in terms of exponents.

Each variable in the denominator:

x appears in two terms: x z and x y, so x^2

y appears in two terms: y z and x y, so y^2

z appears in two terms: y z and x z, so z^2

Wait, no. Let me see:

The denominator is (y z) * (x z) * (x y) 

= y * z * x * z * x * y

= x^2 y^2 z^2

So numerator is x y z, denominator is x² y² z². So the entire product is (x y z) / (x² y² z²) = 1/(x y z). 

So left side is 1/(x y z).

Right side: 2^(1/2 + 1/3 + 1/4). Let me compute the exponent:

1/2 + 1/3 + 1/4. Common denominator is 12.

1/2 = 6/12

1/3 = 4/12

1/4 = 3/12

So sum is 6 + 4 + 3 = 13 over 12, so 13/12.

Therefore, 2^(13/12).

Putting it together:

1/(x y z) = 2^(13/12)

Which implies that x y z = 2^(-13/12)

Hmm, that's a useful equation. Let me denote that as equation (4):

x y z = 2^(-13/12)  ...(4)

So the product of x, y, z is 2^(-13/12). Cool.

Now, I need to find |log₂(x⁴ y³ z²)|. Let me write that expression in terms of logarithms.

log₂(x⁴ y³ z²) = log₂(x^4) + log₂(y^3) + log₂(z^2) = 4 log₂x + 3 log₂y + 2 log₂z

So I need to find 4a + 3b + 2c, where a = log₂x, b = log₂y, c = log₂z.

Alternatively, I can let a = log₂x, b = log₂y, c = log₂z, and express the given equations in terms of a, b, c.

Let me try that substitution. Since log₂(x/(y z)) = 1/2, which is equivalent to log₂x - log₂y - log₂z = 1/2.

Similarly, log₂(y/(x z)) = 1/3 becomes log₂y - log₂x - log₂z = 1/3.

And log₂(z/(x y)) = 1/4 becomes log₂z - log₂x - log₂y = 1/4.

So now, I have a system of three equations with three variables: a, b, c.

Rewrite the equations:

1. a - b - c = 1/2  ...(1b)
2. -a + b - c = 1/3  ...(2b)
3. -a - b + c = 1/4  ...(3b)

So now, I can set up this system:

Equation (1b): a - b - c = 1/2

Equation (2b): -a + b - c = 1/3

Equation (3b): -a - b + c = 1/4

Let me write this in matrix form to see if I can solve for a, b, c.

The coefficients matrix:

[1   -1   -1]

[-1   1   -1]

[-1  -1    1]

The constants are [1/2, 1/3, 1/4]

Hmm, perhaps I can solve this system using elimination.

Let me try adding all three equations together. Let's see:

Adding (1b), (2b), (3b):

(a - b - c) + (-a + b - c) + (-a - b + c) = 1/2 + 1/3 + 1/4

Compute left side:

a - a -a = -a

-b + b - b = -b

-c -c + c = -c

So overall, left side is -a - b - c.

Right side: 1/2 + 1/3 + 1/4. As before, the sum is 13/12.

So we have -a - b - c = 13/12.

Multiply both sides by -1: a + b + c = -13/12  ...(5)

So equation (5): a + b + c = -13/12.

Now, perhaps I can use equation (1b): a - b - c = 1/2. Let me add equation (1b) and equation (5):

Equation (1b) + equation (5):

(a - b - c) + (a + b + c) = 1/2 + (-13/12)

Left side: 2a

Right side: (6/12 - 13/12) = (-7/12)

So 2a = -7/12 → a = -7/(24)

So a = -7/24. That's log₂x = -7/24, so x = 2^(-7/24).

Now, let's find another variable. Let's use equation (2b): -a + b - c = 1/3.

We know a = -7/24, so plug that in:

-(-7/24) + b - c = 1/3 → 7/24 + b - c = 1/3.

Compute 1/3 as 8/24.

So 7/24 + b - c = 8/24 → b - c = 8/24 - 7/24 = 1/24.

So equation (2c): b - c = 1/24.

Similarly, equation (3b): -a - b + c = 1/4.

Again, a = -7/24, so:

-(-7/24) - b + c = 1/4 → 7/24 - b + c = 1/4.

1/4 is 6/24.

So 7/24 - b + c = 6/24 → -b + c = 6/24 -7/24 = -1/24.

So equation (3c): -b + c = -1/24.

So now, from equation (2c) and (3c):

Equation (2c): b - c = 1/24.

Equation (3c): -b + c = -1/24.

Wait, equation (3c) is just -1*(equation (2c)). So equation (3c) is redundant? Because if equation (2c) is b - c = 1/24, then equation (3c) is -b + c = -1/24, which is the same equation multiplied by -1. So that's consistent, but doesn't give a new equation.

So I need another equation to find b and c. Maybe use equation (5): a + b + c = -13/12.

We know a = -7/24, so:

-7/24 + b + c = -13/12.

Convert -13/12 to 24 denominator: -26/24.

So, -7/24 + b + c = -26/24 → b + c = -26/24 + 7/24 = (-26 +7)/24 = (-19)/24.

So equation (5a): b + c = -19/24.

Now, from equation (2c): b - c = 1/24.

So we have:

Equation (2c): b - c = 1/24.

Equation (5a): b + c = -19/24.

We can solve these two equations for b and c.

Adding them:

(b - c) + (b + c) = 1/24 + (-19/24)

2b = (-18)/24 → 2b = -3/4 → b = -3/8.

So b = -3/8.

Now, substitute back into equation (2c): b - c = 1/24.

So -3/8 - c = 1/24.

Convert to 24 denominators:

-9/24 - c = 1/24 → -c = 1/24 + 9/24 = 10/24 → c = -10/24 → c = -5/12.

So c = -5/12.

So now, we have:

a = log₂x = -7/24 → x = 2^(-7/24)

b = log₂y = -3/8 → y = 2^(-3/8)

c = log₂z = -5/12 → z = 2^(-5/12)

Now, the problem asks for |log₂(x⁴ y³ z²)|.

Let me compute that.

log₂(x⁴ y³ z²) = 4 log₂x + 3 log₂y + 2 log₂z = 4a + 3b + 2c.

We have a, b, c:

a = -7/24 → 4a = -7/6

b = -3/8 → 3b = -9/8

c = -5/12 → 2c = -5/6

So adding them:

4a + 3b + 2c = (-7/6) + (-9/8) + (-5/6)

First, convert all to 24 denominators:

-7/6 = -28/24

-9/8 = -27/24

-5/6 = -20/24

Adding: (-28 -27 -20)/24 = (-75)/24

Simplify: -75/24. Let me see if this reduces. 75 and 24 share a factor of 3.

75 ÷3 =25, 24 ÷3=8. So -25/8.

So log₂(x⁴ y³ z²) = -25/8.

Taking absolute value: | -25/8 | = 25/8.

So the value is 25/8, which is already in simplest terms since 25 and 8 are coprime.

Thus, m =25, n=8. m+n=33.

**Final Answer**
The value of \( m + n \) is \boxed{33}.

Given the system of equations involving logarithms:

1. \(\log_2\left(\frac{x}{yz}\right) = \frac{1}{2}\)
2. \(\log_2\left(\frac{y}{xz}\right) = \frac{1}{3}\)
3. \(\log_2\left(\frac{z}{xy}\right) = \frac{1}{4}\)

We convert these logarithmic equations into their exponential forms:

1. \(\frac{x}{yz} = 2^{1/2}\)
2. \(\frac{y}{xz} = 2^{1/3}\)
3. \(\frac{z}{xy} = 2^{1/4}\)

Multiplying these three equations together, we get:

\[
\frac{x}{yz} \cdot \frac{y}{xz} \cdot \frac{z}{xy} = 2^{1/2} \cdot 2^{1/3} \cdot 2^{1/4}
\]

Simplifying the left side:

\[
\frac{x \cdot y \cdot z}{(yz) \cdot (xz) \cdot (xy)} = \frac{1}{x^2 y^2 z^2} = \frac{1}{(xyz)^2}
\]

Simplifying the right side:

\[
2^{1/2 + 1/3 + 1/4} = 2^{13/12}
\]

Thus, we have:

\[
\frac{1}{(xyz)^2} = 2^{13/12} \implies (xyz)^2 = 2^{-13/6} \implies xyz = 2^{-13/12}
\]

Next, we express the given logarithmic equations in terms of \(a = \log_2 x\), \(b = \log_2 y\), and \(c = \log_2 z\):

1. \(a - b - c = \frac{1}{2}\)
2. \(-a + b - c = \frac{1}{3}\)
3. \(-a - b + c = \frac{1}{4}\)

Adding these three equations:

\[
(a - b - c) + (-a + b - c) + (-a - b + c) = \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{3} + \frac{1}{4}
\]

Simplifying the left side:

\[
-a - b - c
\]

Simplifying the right side:

\[
\frac{13}{12}
\]

Thus, we get:

\[
-a - b - c = \frac{13}{12} \implies a + b + c = -\frac{13}{12}
\]

We solve the system of equations:

1. \(a - b - c = \frac{1}{2}\)
2. \(-a + b - c = \frac{1}{3}\)
3. \(-a - b + c = \frac{1}{4}\)

From these, we find:

\[
a = -\frac{7}{24}, \quad b = -\frac{3}{8}, \quad c = -\frac{5}{12}
\]

We need to find \(\left|\log_2(x^4 y^3 z^2)\right|\):

\[
\log_2(x^4 y^3 z^2) = 4a + 3b + 2c
\]

Substituting the values of \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\):

\[
4a + 3b + 2c = 4\left(-\frac{7}{24}\right) + 3\left(-\frac{3}{8}\right) + 2\left(-\frac{5}{12}\right) = -\frac{28}{24} - \frac{9}{8} - \frac{10}{24} = -\frac{25}{8}
\]

Taking the absolute value:

\[
\left| -\frac{25}{8} \right| = \frac{25}{8}
\]

Thus, the value is \(\frac{25}{8}\), where \(m = 25\) and \(n = 8\). Therefore, \(m + n = 25 + 8 = 33\).

The final answer is \(\boxed{33}\).
