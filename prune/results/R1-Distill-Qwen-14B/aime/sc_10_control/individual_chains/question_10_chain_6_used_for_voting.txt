Alright, so I'm trying to solve this problem where Alice chooses a set A of positive integers. Then Bob lists all finite nonempty sets B of positive integers such that the maximum element of B is in A. Bob's list has 2024 sets. I need to find the sum of the elements of A.

Hmm, okay. Let's break this down. First, Alice picks a set A. Bob then considers all finite non-empty sets B where the maximum element of B is in A. The count of such sets is 2024. I need to find the sum of elements in A.

Wait, so A is a set of positive integers, right? So A could be something like {1,2,3}, or {5,10}, anything. Bob is making a list of all finite non-empty sets B where the maximum of B is in A. So for each element a in A, Bob is considering all possible finite sets where a is the maximum element.

So, for each a in A, the number of such sets B is equal to the number of non-empty subsets of the set {1, 2, ..., a-1}, because for a particular a, the maximum is a, so all other elements in B must be less than a. Wait, no, actually, no. Wait, the elements of B can be any positive integers, but the maximum must be a. So the other elements can be any positive integers less than a. But wait, positive integers less than a would be 1, 2, ..., a-1. So the number of non-empty subsets is 2^{a-1} - 1. Wait, no. Wait, the number of subsets where the maximum is a is equal to the number of subsets of {1,2,...,a-1}, because each such subset can have any combination of elements less than a, and then include a as the maximum.

Wait, no. Let me think. For a given a, to construct a set B where the maximum is a, B must contain a and any subset of the numbers less than a. So the number of such sets is equal to the number of subsets of {1,2,...,a-1}, including the empty subset, because you can have B = {a} as well. Therefore, for each a, the number is 2^{a-1}.

Wait, because for each a, the number of possible subsets where the maximum is a is 2^{a-1}. Because each element less than a can be either included or not in B, and a must be included. So the number is 2^{a-1}.

So, if A is a set with elements a1, a2, ..., an, then the total number of sets B that Bob lists is the sum over each a in A of 2^{a-1}.

In the problem, Bob's list has 2024 sets, so the sum of 2^{a-1} for each a in A is 2024.

So, mathematically, sum_{a in A} 2^{a-1} = 2024.

And the question is to find the sum of the elements of A, which is sum_{a in A} a.

So, if I can figure out what the elements of A are such that the sum of 2^{a-1} is 2024, then I can compute the sum of a.

Wait, 2024 is a specific number. Let's see if 2024 can be expressed as a sum of distinct powers of 2, since each term 2^{a-1} is a power of 2. Because for each a, 2^{a-1} is a unique power of 2, as long as the elements of A are distinct. Because A is a set, so its elements are unique.

So, perhaps A consists of integers such that 2^{a-1} are the binary digits of 2024.

Wait, that is, 2024 can be written as a sum of powers of 2, each corresponding to 2^{a-1} for some a in A.

So, first, let's find the binary representation of 2024 to see which powers of 2 are present.

2024 divided by 2: 1012, remainder 0

1012 / 2 = 506, rem 0

506 /2=253, rem 0

253/2=126 rem1

126/2=63 rem0

63/2=31 rem1

31/2=15 rem1

15/2=7 rem1

7/2=3 rem1

3/2=1 rem1

1/2=0 rem1

So writing the remainders from last to first:

11111101000.

Wait, let me count the bits.

Wait, 2024 is less than 2048, which is 2^11. So, 2^11 is 2048. So 2024 is 2048 - 24.

Wait, 24 is 16+8, which is 2^4 + 2^3. So 2024 = 2048 - 16 - 8 = 2^11 - 2^4 - 2^3.

But in terms of binary, 2024 is 11111101000.

Let me compute 2024 in binary:

Compute 2^0=1, 2^1=2, 2^2=4, 2^3=8, 2^4=16, 2^5=32, 2^6=64, 2^7=128, 2^8=256, 2^9=512, 2^10=1024, 2^11=2048.

2024 is 2048 - 24. So 2048 is 1 followed by eleven zeros in binary. Subtracting 24 (which is 16+8), so subtract 16 (2^4) and 8 (2^3). So 2024 is 2048 minus 24, which in binary is 11111101000.

Let me confirm:

11111101000 in binary:

From right (LSB) to left (MSB):

Positions: 0 to 10.

1*(2^10) = 1024

1*(2^9) = 512

1*(2^8) = 256

1*(2^7) = 128

1*(2^6) = 64

1*(2^5) = 32

0*(2^4) = 0

1*(2^3) = 8

0*(2^2) = 0

0*(2^1) = 0

0*(2^0) = 0

Wait, that sums to 1024 + 512 + 256 + 128 + 64 + 32 + 8 = 2024. Yes, that's correct.

So, 2024 is 11111101000 in binary, which is 11 bits. So the binary digits set are at positions 10,9,8,7,6,5,3. Wait, but actually, the rightmost bit is position 0.

So, let's number from right starting at 0:

Bit 10: 1

Bit 9:1

Bit8:1

Bit7:1

Bit6:1

Bit5:1

Bit4:0

Bit3:1

Bit2:0

Bit1:0

Bit0:0

So the bits set are at positions 10,9,8,7,6,5,3.

Which correspond to exponents 10,9,8,7,6,5,3.

But wait, in the problem, each term is 2^{a-1}, so 2^{a-1} is a term. So each term is a power of 2, and the sum of these terms is 2024.

So, 2024 is equal to sum_{a in A} 2^{a-1}.

So, each 2^{a-1} is a power of 2, and the sum is 2024. So the binary representation tells us which exponents are present.

Each term 2^{a-1} corresponds to a bit in the binary representation. So if 2024 is expressed as a sum of distinct powers of 2, each 2^{k} corresponds to 2^{a-1}, so a-1 = k, so a = k +1.

Therefore, the exponents in the binary representation are the k's, so the a's are k+1.

Looking at the binary representation of 2024, which is 11111101000, the positions where the bits are set correspond to exponents 3,5,6,7,8,9,10.

Wait, let me list the exponents where the bits are set:

From the binary representation, bits are set at positions 3,5,6,7,8,9,10 (since position 3 is the 4th bit from the right, etc.)

Wait, actually, in binary, the rightmost bit is position 0. So in 11111101000, the leftmost 1 is at position 10, then 9,8,7,6,5, and then position 3.

So the exponents are 10,9,8,7,6,5,3.

So 2^{a-1} = 2^{10}, 2^9, ..., 2^3.

Therefore, a-1 = 10,9,8,7,6,5,3.

Hence, a = 11,10,9,8,7,6,4.

Wait, so A is {4,6,7,8,9,10,11}.

Wait, checking: 2^{10} is 1024, 2^9=512, 2^8=256, 2^7=128, 2^6=64, 2^5=32, 2^3=8.

Sum: 1024 + 512 = 1536; 1536+256=1792; 1792+128=1920; 1920+64=1984; 1984+32=2016; 2016+8=2024. Yes, that adds up.

So A = {4,6,7,8,9,10,11}.

So the sum of elements of A is 4+6+7+8+9+10+11.

Let me compute that:

4+6=10

10+7=17

17+8=25

25+9=34

34+10=44

44+11=55.

So the sum is 55.

Wait, that makes sense. So the answer is 55.

But wait, just to confirm: Let's make sure that the number of sets B is indeed 2024 when A is {4,6,7,8,9,10,11}.

Each a in A contributes 2^{a-1} sets.

So, for a=4: 2^{3}=8 sets.

a=6: 2^5=32

a=7: 64

a=8:128

a=9:256

a=10:512

a=11:1024

Sum:8+32=40; +64=104; +128=232; +256=488; +512=999; +1024=2023? Wait, that's 2023? Wait, no.

Wait, 8+32=40

40+64=104

104+128=232

232+256=488

488+512= 1000

1000 + 1024=2024.

Yes, correct. So the sum is 2024.

Therefore, A is {4,6,7,8,9,10,11}, sum is 55.

Wait, but just to make sure I didn't miss any exponents. The binary representation was 11111101000. So which exponents are set? Let's write the binary number as bits:

From right to left: positions 0 to 10.

Position 10: 1

9:1

8:1

7:1

6:1

5:1

4:0

3:1

2:0

1:0

0:0

So the exponents are 10,9,8,7,6,5,3.

Therefore, a-1 =10,9,8,7,6,5,3.

Thus, a=11,10,9,8,7,6,4.

Yes, that's correct. So A is {4,6,7,8,9,10,11}.

Adding them: 4+6+7+8+9+10+11.

Wait, let's add them again:

4+6=10

10+7=17

17+8=25

25+9=34

34+10=44

44+11=55.

Yes, 55.

So the sum is 55.

I think that's solid. So I'll go with 55 as the answer.

Alice chooses a set \( A \) of positive integers. Bob then lists all finite nonempty sets \( B \) of positive integers where the maximum element of \( B \) belongs to \( A \). The total number of such sets \( B \) is 2024. To find the sum of the elements of \( A \):

1. **Understanding the Problem**: For each \( a \in A \), the number of sets \( B \) where the maximum element is \( a \) is \( 2^{a-1} \). Thus, the total number of sets is \( \sum_{a \in A} 2^{a-1} = 2024 \).

2. **Binary Representation**: Expressing 2024 in binary gives \( 11111101000 \), which corresponds to the sum of powers of 2: \( 2^{10} + 2^9 + 2^8 + 2^7 + 2^6 + 2^5 + 2^3 \).

3. **Determining Set \( A \)**: Each term \( 2^{a-1} \) corresponds to \( a = k + 1 \) where \( k \) is the exponent in the binary representation. Thus, \( A = \{4, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11\} \).

4. **Calculating the Sum**: The sum of the elements in \( A \) is \( 4 + 6 + 7 + 8 + 9 + 10 + 11 = 55 \).

The sum of the elements of \( A \) is \(\boxed{55}\).
