Okay, so I've got this problem here about 900 residents in Aimeville, and they own different things like diamond rings, golf clubs, garden spades, and everyone has a bag of candy hearts. The question is asking how many people own all four of these things. Hmm, seems like a problem where I need to use some set theory or inclusion-exclusion principle.

Let me start by jotting down the given numbers. So, total residents, which is the universal set, is 900. Now, the number of people owning each item: diamond rings (D) = 195, golf clubs (G) = 367, garden spades (S) = 562. Oh, and everyone owns a bag of candy hearts (C). So, C is 900. That's interesting because it means that C is the universal set here—everybody owns it.

The problem also states that 437 residents own exactly two of these things, and 234 own exactly three. So, I need to find the number who own all four. Let's denote the number of people owning all four as x. So, x is our unknown.

I remember the inclusion-exclusion principle for four sets. The formula is:

|D ∪ G ∪ S ∪ C| = |D| + |G| + |S| + |C| - |D∩G| - |D∩S| - |D∩C| - |G∩S| - |G∩C| - |S∩C| + |D∩G∩S| + |D∩G∩C| + |D∩S∩C| + |G∩S∩C| - |D∩G∩S∩C|

But wait, since every resident owns at least C (the candy hearts), the union of all four sets is actually 900. Because you can't have someone not owning C. So, |D ∪ G ∪ S ∪ C| = 900.

Hmm, but I think this might get complicated because I don't have all the pairwise or triple overlaps. Maybe I should think in terms of the principle that counts the number of elements in the union as the sum of individual sets minus the sum of all possible two-set intersections plus the sum of three-set intersections, and so on.

Alternatively, I remember that the total number is equal to the sum of each individual set minus the sum of all pairs plus the sum of all triples minus the four-way intersection. But in this case, since every person owns at least C, perhaps the four-way intersection is just the number of people owning all four, which is x. Wait, no, because the four-way intersection is exactly those who own all four, yes.

But let me think again. Maybe it's better to use the formula that relates the number of elements in the union, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps I can use the fact that the total number is 900, and express that in terms of the given numbers.

Wait, another approach is to consider the principle that the sum of all individual set sizes equals the number of elements in the union plus the number of elements in exactly two sets plus twice the number in exactly three sets plus three times the four-way intersection. Or maybe I need to think about how inclusion-exclusion accounts for overlaps.

Wait, no, maybe it's better to think in terms of the principle where the sum of the sizes of all sets is equal to the number of elements in exactly one set plus twice the number in exactly two sets plus three times the number in exactly three sets plus four times the number in all four sets.

But in this problem, we know the number of people in exactly two sets (437) and exactly three sets (234). But we don't know the number in exactly one set or the four-way intersection.

Wait, but the total number of people is 900, which is the sum of people in exactly one set, exactly two sets, exactly three sets, exactly four sets, and perhaps considering that everyone owns at least C.

Wait, but actually, since everyone owns C, the possible ownerships can be considered as being in various combinations of the other three items. But maybe it's better to approach this using the inclusion-exclusion formula for four sets.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to model this by considering the problem as four sets where each element is in at least one set, but since C is universal, that's not the case here—it's possible for someone not to own D, G, or S, but they must own C. Wait, no, that's not necessarily the case. Wait, no, the problem says that each of the 900 residents owns a bag of candy hearts. So, C is the universal set. So, the union of D, G, S, and C is 900, but since C is 900, that means that the union of D, G, S, and C is 900, which is the same as C, so all residents are in C, but some may also be in D, G, or S.

Wait, but in this case, maybe the inclusion-exclusion formula can be adjusted. Let me think again. So, the formula for the union of four sets is:

|D ∪ G ∪ S ∪ C| = |D| + |G| + |S| + |C| - |D∩G| - |D∩S| - |D∩C| - |G∩S| - |G∩C| - |S∩C| + |D∩G∩S| + |D∩G∩C| + |D∩S∩C| + |G∩S∩C| - |D∩G∩S∩C|

But since |D ∪ G ∪ S ∪ C| is 900, and C is 900, this equation becomes:

900 = 195 + 367 + 562 + 900 - [sum of all pairwise intersections] + [sum of all triple intersections] - |D∩G∩S∩C|

Wait, but this seems a bit messy because I don't have any of the pairwise or triple intersection values. But maybe I can find another way.

Wait, perhaps I can use the principle that the total number of residents is equal to the number of people owning exactly one item plus the number owning exactly two, exactly three, and exactly four. Since everyone owns at least C, but some may own more.

Wait, no, because the problem states that residents can own any combination, including none of D, G, S, but they must own C. So, the possible ownerships are:

- Exactly one item: could be C only, but since C is a must, maybe it's someone who owns only C. But in the problem, the counts for D, G, and S are given, but C is everyone. Wait, but the problem says "each of the 900 residents owns a bag of candy hearts." So, C is universal. So, when it counts 195 owning D, 367 owning G, 562 owning S, these are the numbers for those who own each of those, but all of them are also in C.

So, perhaps we can model the problem as follows. Each resident is in C, and may be in D, G, or S, or any combination of those. So, the counts for exactly two, exactly three, and all four would be the overlaps between D, G, and S, along with C.

Wait, so maybe the total number of people is 900, which can be represented as the sum of:

- a: people owning exactly one of D, G, S (but since C is universal, these people would also own C. So, their total is a + b + c, but since C is always included, perhaps the 'exactly one' refers to exactly one of D, G, S, while also owning C. Hmm, maybe I should model this in terms of the inclusion-exclusion formula for three sets, considering that C is always present.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to adjust the problem by considering that since C is universal, it's included in all the ownership counts. So, the numbers for D, G, S are the number of people owning those in addition to C. So, perhaps the counts are:

- Only D and C: d

- Only G and C: g

- Only S and C: s

- Both D and G and C: dg

- Both D and S and C: ds

- Both G and S and C: gs

- All three D, G, S and C: dgs

And then the number of people owning exactly two of D, G, S, C would be those who own exactly two of D, G, S, along with C. So, for example, someone owning D and C but not G or S would be in the 'exactly two' category if they own exactly two, which would require that they don't own any of the others. Wait, no, because the problem states that 437 own exactly two of these things, and 234 own exactly three. So, I need to model the overlaps.

Wait, perhaps I should use the counts for exactly two and exactly three to find the four-way intersection. Let me think.

Let me denote:

- Let a = number of people owning exactly one of D, G, S (but they all own C as well, so they have exactly one of D, G, S plus C).

- Let b = number owning exactly two of D, G, S (but they also own C, so their total is two from D, G, S, plus C).

- Let c = number owning exactly three of D, G, S (so they have all three plus C).

- Let x = number owning all four (D, G, S, C).

Wait, but the problem says that 437 own exactly two of these things, and 234 own exactly three. So, the 'exactly two' is 437, which would include those who own two of D, G, S, and C. Similarly, 'exactly three' would be 234, which includes those who own all three of D, G, S, and C. But wait, does that include C? I think so because C is always present.

Wait, no. Because in the problem statement, when they say 'exactly two of these things', they probably mean exactly two of the four, including C. So, someone who owns D and C but not G or S would be counted in exactly two. Similarly, someone who owns D and G and C but not S would be counted in exactly three.

So, the sum of all residents is:

a (exactly one) + b (exactly two) + c (exactly three) + x (exactly four) = 900.

But wait, the problem gives us that exactly two is 437, exactly three is 234. So, that would mean:

a + 437 + 234 + x = 900

Wait, but that leaves a + x = 900 - 437 - 234 = 900 - 671 = 229.

So, a + x = 229.

Hmm, but we need another equation to find x, so we need to involve the counts of D, G, S.

So, the number of people owning D is 195. This includes all the people who own D and any combination with G, S, or both, along with C.

Similarly, the count for D is the number of people owning exactly D and C (a part of 'exactly one'), plus those who own D and another item (part of 'exactly two'), plus those who own D and two others (part of 'exactly three'), and those who own all four.

So, in terms of the variables I defined earlier:

|D| = number of people owning D = a_D + b_DG + b_DS + c_DGS + x

Wait, perhaps it's better to think in terms of:

The number of people owning D is equal to the number of people who own D and exactly one other thing (excluding C, but since C is always present, I'm a bit confused), plus those who own D and two others, plus those who own all three others.

Wait, perhaps it's better to model it as:

The number of people owning D is equal to the number of people owning only D and C (i.e., exactly one item, D) plus those owning D and exactly one other (so, D and G, D and S) plus those owning D and two others (D, G, S) plus those owning all four.

But in our earlier variables, a, b, c, x are defined as:

a: exactly one of D, G, S (but they all own C, so they have exactly one item besides C)

b: exactly two of D, G, S (so they have exactly two items besides C)

c: exactly three of D, G, S (they have exactly three items besides C)

x: all four (so D, G, S, C)

Wait, but the problem says that 437 own exactly two of the four things. Since C is always present, the 'exactly two' would be those who own C plus exactly one other item (either D, G, or S). So, for example, someone who owns C and D but not G or S would be counted in exactly two.

Similarly, someone who owns C, D, and G but not S would be in exactly three.

Wait, so perhaps the counts a, b, c, x are as follows:

a: exactly one of D, G, S (so they own C plus exactly one of D, G, S). So, number of people owning exactly C and D, C and G, or C and S.

b: exactly two of D, G, S, but in addition to C, so they own C plus two of D, G, S.

c: exactly three of D, G, S, plus C, so they own all three plus C.

x: exactly four, which is everyone owning D, G, S, and C.

But then the problem states that 437 own exactly two of the four things. So, exactly two would include those who have two of D, G, S plus C. So, for example, someone who owns D, G, and C but not S would be in exactly three of the four things (D, G, C). Wait, no, wait: the four things are D, G, S, C. So, someone who owns D, G, and C would have exactly three of the four, because C is always present. No, wait, C is the fourth thing, so if someone owns D, G, and C, then they own three things: D, G, C. So, that would be in the 'exactly three' category. Similarly, someone who owns D and C would have exactly two of the four: D and C.

Wait, so the 'exactly two' category includes people who own exactly two of the four: either (C and D), (C and G), (C and S), or any combination of two among D, G, S, plus C.

Wait, no, that's not correct. Because if someone owns D and G, they also have C, so they have three things: D, G, C. So, they would be in the 'exactly three' category.

Wait, I'm getting confused here. Let me try to clarify.

The four items are D, G, S, C.

Each resident owns some subset of these, with C being included in everyone.

So, when the problem says someone owns exactly two of these things, it means exactly two of the four, which includes C. So, for example, someone owning C and D would be exactly two. Similarly, someone owning C and G is exactly two. But someone owning D, G, and C would be exactly three.

So, in this case, the 'exactly two' category includes those who own any two of the four, which would be the combinations including C plus one other. Because if they have two other items besides C, that would be three things, hence in 'exactly three'.

Wait, no. Wait, if someone owns C and D, that's two things. If someone owns C, D, and G, that's three things. So, the 'exactly two' includes people who own C plus exactly one other item. So, the count of 437 is the number of people who own exactly one of D, G, S plus C, so exactly two of the four.

Similarly, the 234 who own exactly three of the four would be those who own C plus exactly two of D, G, S. So, they have three things: C and two others.

And the x is the number who own all four: C plus D, G, S.

Wait, that makes sense. So, the counts are:

- Exactly two: 437, which is the number of people who own C plus exactly one of D, G, S.

- Exactly three: 234, which is the number of people who own C plus exactly two of D, G, S.

- Exactly four: x, which is C plus D, G, S.

And the rest would be those who own only C, so exactly one of the four things: C.

Wait, but the problem says that each of the 900 residents owns a bag of candy hearts. So, the number of people who own exactly C is 900 minus (exactly two + exactly three + exactly four). So, 900 - (437 + 234 + x) = 900 - 671 - x = 229 - x.

So, the number of people owning exactly C is 229 - x, but since we don't have any restrictions on that, perhaps that's not needed.

Now, the next step is to relate the counts of D, G, and S to these categories.

Let's start with the number of people owning D, which is 195. These include:

- People who own exactly C and D (part of exactly two: 437)

- People who own exactly C, D, and G (part of exactly three: 234)

- People who own exactly C, D, and S (part of exactly three: 234)

- People who own exactly C, D, G, S (x: all four)

Wait, but let me think. For D, the count is the sum of:

- Those who own only D and C: this is part of the exactly two category (C and D), so the number is a subset of 437.

- Those who own D, C, and another item (either G or S): these would be part of the exactly three category (C, D, G or C, D, S), so each of these is a subset of 234.

- Those who own D, C, and both G and S: that's the exactly four category, x.

Similarly, the count for D is:

|D| = (number with C and D only) + (number with C, D, G) + (number with C, D, S) + (number with C, D, G, S)

But in terms of our variables:

|D| = (let's say, a1) + (b1) + (b2) + x

Where a1 is the number of people owning exactly C and D (so part of exactly two: 437), b1 is the number owning exactly C, D, G (part of exactly three: 234), b2 is the number owning exactly C, D, S (part of exactly three: 234), and x is the number owning all four.

But wait, perhaps it's better to model it as:

The number of people owning D is equal to the number of people who own D and exactly one other thing (C), plus those who own D and exactly two others (C and G or C and S), plus those who own D and all three others (C, G, S).

So, |D| = (number with exactly C and D) + (number with exactly C, D, G) + (number with exactly C, D, S) + (number with C, D, G, S)

But in terms of the variables we have:

The 'exactly two' category (437) includes people who own exactly C and D, exactly C and G, or exactly C and S.

Similarly, the 'exactly three' category (234) includes those who own C, D, G; C, D, S; C, G, S.

And the 'exactly four' category (x) is those who own all four.

So, for D:

|D| = (number of people with exactly C and D) + (number with exactly C, D, G) + (number with exactly C, D, S) + x.

Similarly, the same applies for G and S.

But how do we relate this to the given numbers? Let me denote:

Let’s say:

- a1: number of people owning exactly C and D (so part of exactly two: 437)

- a2: number owning exactly C and G

- a3: number owning exactly C and S

Then, a1 + a2 + a3 = 437 (the exactly two category)

Similarly, for exactly three:

- b1: number owning exactly C, D, G

- b2: number owning exactly C, D, S

- b3: number owning exactly C, G, S

So, b1 + b2 + b3 = 234

And x is the number owning all four.

Now, the count for D is a1 + b1 + b2 + x = 195.

Similarly, for G: a2 + b1 + b3 + x = 367.

And for S: a3 + b2 + b3 + x = 562.

So, we have three equations:

1) a1 + b1 + b2 + x = 195

2) a2 + b1 + b3 + x = 367

3) a3 + b2 + b3 + x = 562

And we also know:

4) a1 + a2 + a3 = 437

5) b1 + b2 + b3 = 234

Our unknowns are a1, a2, a3, b1, b2, b3, x.

So, that's seven variables and five equations. Hmm, seems like we need more equations. But perhaps we can find a way to express the sum of the three equations.

Let me add equations 1, 2, and 3:

(a1 + a2 + a3) + (b1 + b2 + b3) + 3x = 195 + 367 + 562

We know from equations 4 and 5 that a1+a2+a3=437 and b1+b2+b3=234.

So, substituting:

437 + 234 + 3x = 195 + 367 + 562

Let me compute the right side:

195 + 367 = 562; 562 + 562 = 1124

So, 437 + 234 + 3x = 1124

Compute 437 + 234: 437 + 200 = 637; 637 +34=671

So, 671 + 3x = 1124

Subtract 671 from both sides:

3x = 1124 - 671 = 453

So, x = 453 / 3 = 151.

Wait, so x is 151. That would be the number of people owning all four things.

Let me check if this makes sense. So, x=151.

Let me see if this works.

From the sum of the three equations:

437 + 234 + 3x = 1124

Which gives 3x=453, x=151.

So, that seems to check out.

Now, let me see if the other variables make sense. For example, let's compute the sum of the individual equations.

But perhaps I can just accept that since the math checks out, x=151 is the correct answer.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To solve the problem, we use the principle of inclusion-exclusion and the given data:

- Total residents: 900
- Residents owning exactly two items: 437
- Residents owning exactly three items: 234
- Residents owning all four items: \( x \) (to be determined)
- Residents owning only candy hearts: \( 900 - (437 + 234 + x) = 229 - x \)

We denote:
- \( a_1 \): Residents owning exactly candy hearts and diamond rings.
- \( a_2 \): Residents owning exactly candy hearts and golf clubs.
- \( a_3 \): Residents owning exactly candy hearts and garden spades.
- \( b_1 \): Residents owning exactly candy hearts, diamond rings, and golf clubs.
- \( b_2 \): Residents owning exactly candy hearts, diamond rings, and garden spades.
- \( b_3 \): Residents owning exactly candy hearts, golf clubs, and garden spades.

From the problem:
- \( a_1 + a_2 + a_3 = 437 \) (exactly two items)
- \( b_1 + b_2 + b_3 = 234 \) (exactly three items)

The counts for each item are:
1. Diamond rings (\( |D| \)): \( a_1 + b_1 + b_2 + x = 195 \)
2. Golf clubs (\( |G| \)): \( a_2 + b_1 + b_3 + x = 367 \)
3. Garden spades (\( |S| \)): \( a_3 + b_2 + b_3 + x = 562 \)

Adding these three equations:
\[
(a_1 + a_2 + a_3) + (b_1 + b_2 + b_3) + 3x = 195 + 367 + 562
\]
Substituting known values:
\[
437 + 234 + 3x = 1124
\]
\[
671 + 3x = 1124
\]
\[
3x = 453
\]
\[
x = 151
\]

Thus, the number of residents who own all four items is:

\boxed{151}
