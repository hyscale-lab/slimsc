Okay, so I have this problem about a regular octagon where each vertex is colored either red or blue, each with a 50-50 chance. The question is about finding the probability that there exists a rotation of the octagon such that all the blue vertices end up where the red ones were originally and vice versa. The answer needs to be in the form of a reduced fraction m/n, and then we have to find m + n.

Hmm, let me break this down. First, a regular octagon has eight vertices, each colored red or blue independently. So, the total number of possible colorings is 2^8 = 256. That's straightforward.

Now, the problem is about the probability that we can rotate the octagon so that the set of blue vertices maps exactly onto the set of red vertices. So, essentially, if after some rotation, every blue vertex is where a red was before, and every red is where a blue was before. 

Wait, does that mean the number of blue and red vertices must be the same? Because if you're swapping the colors, the counts must match. So, the number of blue vertices must equal the number of red vertices. Since there are 8 vertices, that means there must be exactly 4 blue and 4 red vertices. 

So, first, maybe I should calculate the number of colorings where there are exactly 4 blue and 4 red vertices. That's C(8,4) = 70. But wait, not all of these 70 colorings satisfy the condition about rotation. So, the total number of favorable colorings is less than 70, and the probability is that number divided by 256.

Now, the key is to find how many colorings allow for such a rotation. So, for a given coloring with 4 blue and 4 red vertices, when is there a rotation that swaps all the blues with reds?

This seems related to group theory and perhaps Burnside's lemma or something similar. Wait, Burnside's lemma is about counting orbits, but maybe I can approach this problem by considering the symmetries of the octagon.

The octagon has rotational symmetries of order 8, meaning rotations by 0°, 45°, 90°, ..., 315°. For each coloring, we can consider the set of rotations that map the coloring to its complement (i.e., swapping blue and red). 

But perhaps it's easier to think about each rotation and see how many colorings are fixed by that rotation in a way that their image under rotation is the complement.

Wait, another approach: For the coloring to be such that some rotation maps blue to red, the set of blue vertices must be a rotation of the set of red vertices. So, the blue vertices must form a rotationally symmetric set relative to the red ones.

In other words, the blue vertices must be a translate (rotation) of the red vertices. So, for each possible rotation, we can check if the blue vertices are a rotation image of the red vertices. But since the octagon is regular, all rotations are cyclic shifts.

Alternatively, the set of blue vertices must be a union of orbits under the rotation action. Wait, but each orbit is a single vertex if we're considering the full symmetry group, but maybe not. Wait, no, each rotation symmetry is a cyclic permutation of all vertices.

Wait, maybe another way: For a given rotation by k positions (where k is from 0 to 7), the coloring is such that rotating the octagon by k positions swaps blue and red. So, for each k, we can count the number of colorings where rotating by k positions maps blue to red. Then, the total number of favorable colorings would be the union over all k of these sets. But since rotations can overlap, we have to be careful not to double-count.

But perhaps inclusion-exclusion is needed here, but that might get complicated. Alternatively, maybe I can model this as a necklace problem, where we're looking for necklaces that are symmetric under some rotation when considering the color swap.

Wait, another thought: If the coloring can be rotated to swap blue and red, then the coloring must be fixed under some rotation composed with the color inversion. So, if I consider the dihedral group of the octagon, which includes rotations and reflections, but here we're only considering rotations because reflection would also be a symmetry, but the problem specifies rotation, not reflection.

Wait, no, the problem specifically says "rotated," so only rotational symmetries are considered.

So, perhaps the coloring needs to be fixed under some rotation followed by color inversion. So, if I rotate the octagon by k positions and then invert the colors (blue to red and red to blue), the coloring remains the same.

Wait, that might be an alternative way to think about it: The coloring is fixed under rotation by k and inversion. So, the coloring must satisfy the condition that rotating by k and inverting colors leaves it unchanged.

So, for each rotation k, we can find the number of colorings fixed under rotation by k and inversion. Then, the total number of such colorings is the union over all k, but again, we have to account for overlaps.

But perhaps, instead of inclusion-exclusion, we can compute the total number using Burnside's lemma.

Wait, Burnside's lemma says that the number of orbits is equal to the average number of fixed points. But I'm not sure if that's directly applicable here. Maybe I need to model this differently.

Alternatively, each rotation k can be associated with a permutation of the vertices. For a coloring to be such that rotation by k followed by color inversion leaves it unchanged, the coloring must satisfy that for each vertex i, its color is the inverse of the color of vertex i + k.

In other words, the color at position i is equal to the inverse of the color at position i + k (mod 8). Since the color inversion swaps red and blue, which are two colors, each color is the inverse of the other.

So, for each rotation k, the condition is that color(i) = inverse(color(i + k)) for all i.

Now, if the rotation by k has order d (i.e., the smallest positive integer m such that km ≡ 0 mod 8), then d is the gcd(k,8). So, for each k, the cycle decomposition under rotation by k will have cycles of length d. For example, if k=2, then the cycles are (0,2,4,6) and (1,3,5,7), each of length 4.

Wait, but in this case, for each cycle, the coloring must satisfy that each color is the inverse of the color two steps ahead. So, if we have a cycle of even length, perhaps this imposes some constraints.

Wait, let's consider a specific k. Let me pick k=0 first. Rotation by 0 positions is the identity. Then the condition becomes color(i) = inverse(color(i)) for all i. Since color(i) must equal its own inverse, which implies that each color must be fixed under inversion. But red and blue are swapped under inversion, so the only way color(i) = inverse(color(i)) is if color(i) is fixed. But red inverts to blue and vice versa, so the only way color(i) remains the same under inversion is if it's fixed, but that's not possible unless red=blue, which isn't the case. Therefore, for k=0, there are no colorings fixed under rotation by 0 and inversion. Wait, but that can't be right because if the coloring is all red or all blue, then rotating by 0 positions would leave it unchanged, but inverting colors would change it. So, maybe I'm not applying this correctly.

Wait, perhaps I'm mixing up the interpretation. Let me clarify: For a coloring to satisfy rotation by k followed by inversion, it must be that after rotating by k and inverting colors, the coloring is the same as before. So, if C is the coloring, then Invert(Rotate_k(C)) = C.

Which implies that for each vertex i, the color at i in C must be equal to the inverted color at (i - k) mod 8 in C. Because rotating by k moves vertex i -k to i, and then inverting that color gives the color at i.

So, color(i) = inverse(color(i -k)).

But since inversion swaps red and blue, this implies that color(i) ≠ color(i -k). Because inverse(color(i -k)) is the opposite color of color(i -k), so color(i) must be the opposite of color(i -k).

Therefore, for each i, color(i) is the opposite of color(i -k). So, the coloring must alternate in some way determined by k.

But wait, if k is such that rotating by k gives a permutation with cycles, then the coloring must alternate colors in each cycle.

Wait, for example, if k=1, then the permutation is a single cycle of length 8. So, the coloring must alternate colors every step. That would require that the colors alternate R, B, R, B, etc. But since 8 is even, this is possible. So, for k=1, the only colorings that satisfy the condition are the two alternating colorings: starting with red or starting with blue.

Wait, but if the octagon is rotated by 1 and then inverted, does that result in the original coloring? Let's check.

Suppose we have a coloring where the colors alternate R, B, R, B... If we rotate by 1, the first vertex becomes the second, which is blue, then invert the colors: blue becomes red, red becomes blue. So, the first vertex would become blue, the second becomes red, and so on. So, the coloring after rotation and inversion is B, R, B, R... which is the other alternating coloring. So, that's different from the original R, B, R, B... So, actually, this doesn't satisfy the condition that Rotate_k followed by inversion equals the original.

Wait, but if we invert the colors before rotating, would that fix it? No, because the problem says rotate then invert.

Hmm, maybe I need to think differently. For a coloring to be fixed under Rotate_k followed by inversion, we must have that for each vertex i, color(i) = inverse(color((i -k) mod 8)).

So, for k=1, each color(i) must equal inverse(color(i -1 mod 8)). So, this creates a chain: color(0) = inverse(color(7)), color(1) = inverse(color(0)), color(2) = inverse(color(1)), and so on.

This would mean that the colors must alternate, but in a way that color(0) = inverse(color(7)), color(1) = inverse(color(0)), etc. But since k=1, the cycle is length 8, which is even. So, if we follow the chain, color(0) = inverse(color(7)) = inverse(color(6)) if we follow the cycle. Wait, no, because each step is inverse of the previous.

Wait, perhaps it's better to see that for a cycle of length d, the coloring must alternate colors every step, but for parity reasons, if d is even, this is possible, but if d is odd, it's impossible because it would lead to a contradiction.

Wait, for k=1, the cycle length is 8, which is even. So, we can have two possible colorings: one where the colors alternate R, B, R, B, etc., and another where they alternate B, R, B, R, etc. But as I saw earlier, rotating by 1 and inverting doesn't leave these colorings invariant. So, perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, let's take a specific example. Suppose the coloring is R, B, R, B, R, B, R, B. Now, rotate by 1: the first vertex becomes the color of the second, which is B. Then invert: B becomes R. So, the first vertex is now R, which was the original first vertex. The second vertex becomes the third, which is R, invert to B. So, the second vertex is B, which was the original. Wait, so actually, in this case, Rotate_1 followed by inversion leaves the coloring invariant.

Wait, but let's check:

Original: R, B, R, B, R, B, R, B.

After Rotate_1: B, R, B, R, B, R, B, R.

After inversion: R, B, R, B, R, B, R, B.

Which is the original coloring. So yes, this coloring is fixed under Rotate_1 followed by inversion.

Similarly, the other alternating coloring B, R, B, R, B, R, B, R would also be fixed under Rotate_1 followed by inversion.

So, for k=1, there are two colorings that are fixed under Rotate_k followed by inversion.

Similarly, for other k's, we can find the number of colorings.

So, for each rotation k, the number of colorings fixed under Rotate_k followed by inversion is equal to 2^{c}, where c is the number of cycles in the permutation induced by rotation k.

Wait, because each cycle can be independently assigned a color, but under the condition that each position in the cycle is the inverse of the previous. Since the cycle has length d, if d is even, then the number of fixed colorings is 2, because you can choose the starting color and it alternates. If d is odd, then it's impossible because you end up with a contradiction.

Wait, let me think again. For a cycle of length d, the condition is that color(i) = inverse(color(i -k)). So, in each cycle, we have a system of equations where each color is the inverse of the previous. So, if we traverse the entire cycle, starting from some color, it alternates each step. So, for the cycle to be consistent, the number of steps must be even, otherwise, you end up with a contradiction where a color is equal to its own inverse, which isn't possible.

Therefore, for a given k, if the cycle length d is even, then each cycle can be assigned a consistent coloring (two possibilities: starting with red or blue), and if d is odd, there are no such colorings.

Therefore, for each rotation k, the number of fixed colorings under Rotate_k followed by inversion is 0 if any of the cycles has odd length, and 2^{number of cycles} if all cycles have even length.

Wait, but the cycle decomposition of rotation k is determined by the gcd(k,8). For example, if k is 2, then gcd(2,8)=2, so the cycle length is 8/2=4. Wait, no, actually, the number of cycles is gcd(k,8). So, for k=2, the number of cycles is 2, each of length 4.

Wait, let's clarify:

In permutation terms, a rotation by k positions decomposes into gcd(k,8) cycles, each of length 8/gcd(k,8). So, for example, if k=2, gcd(2,8)=2, so there are 2 cycles, each of length 4.

Now, for each cycle, the condition is that each color is the inverse of the next. So, for a cycle of even length, we can assign colors consistently, starting with red or blue. So, each cycle contributes a factor of 2.

Therefore, the number of colorings fixed under rotation by k and inversion is 2^{number of cycles}, provided that all cycles have even length. If any cycle has odd length, then the condition cannot be satisfied, and the number of fixed colorings is zero.

Wait, but 8 is even, so for any k, the cycle length is 8/gcd(k,8). So, when is 8/gcd(k,8) even?

Well, 8 is 2^3, so the possible values of gcd(k,8) are 1, 2, 4, 8.

So,

- If gcd(k,8)=1: cycle length=8, which is even. So, number of cycles=1. So, number of fixed colorings=2^1=2.

- If gcd(k,8)=2: cycle length=4, which is even. Number of cycles=2. So, fixed colorings=2^2=4.

- If gcd(k,8)=4: cycle length=2, which is even. Number of cycles=4. Fixed colorings=2^4=16.

- If gcd(k,8)=8: cycle length=1, which is odd. So, fixed colorings=0, because we can't have color(i)=inverse(color(i)), which as before, is impossible because red and blue are swapped.

So, for each k in 0 to 7, we can compute the number of fixed colorings under rotation by k followed by inversion.

But let's tabulate this:

k | gcd(k,8) | Number of cycles | Cycle length | Fixed colorings
---|--------|---------------|-------------|--------------
0 | 8      | 8 cycles of length 1 | 1 (odd) | 0 (since cycle length is odd)
1 | 1      | 1 cycle of length 8 | 8 (even) | 2
2 | 2      | 2 cycles of length 4 | 4 (even) | 4
3 | 1      | 1 cycle of length 8 | 8 (even) | 2
4 | 4      | 4 cycles of length 2 | 2 (even) | 16
5 | 1      | 1 cycle of length 8 | 8 (even) | 2
6 | 2      | 2 cycles of length 4 | 4 (even) | 4
7 | 1      | 1 cycle of length 8 | 8 (even) | 2

So, for each k from 0 to 7, the number of fixed colorings is as above.

Now, the total number of colorings that are fixed under some rotation k followed by inversion is the union over all k of these fixed colorings. But since some colorings might be fixed under multiple rotations, we need to compute the total using inclusion-exclusion or Burnside's lemma.

Wait, but Burnside's lemma is about the number of orbits, but here we're trying to count the number of colorings fixed under at least one rotation k followed by inversion.

Alternatively, perhaps we can model this as the total number of colorings fixed by any of these operations, which is the union of the fixed sets for each k. So, the total number is the sum over k of fixed(k), minus the sum over pairs (k1,k2) of fixed(k1,k2), plus the sum over triples, etc.

But this seems complicated. Maybe a better approach is to use the principle of inclusion-exclusion, but perhaps it's easier to compute the total number using generating functions or Möbius inversion.

Alternatively, perhaps each coloring that satisfies the condition is counted exactly once for each rotation k that fixes it. So, the total number of such colorings is equal to the average number of fixed colorings per rotation.

Wait, no, that’s not correct. Because Burnside's lemma says that the number of orbits is equal to the average number of fixed points, but here we're looking for the total number of colorings fixed by at least one rotation.

Alternatively, perhaps the total number of colorings fixed by any rotation is equal to the sum over k of fixed(k), divided by something. Hmm, I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach: Each coloring that can be rotated to swap blue and red must have a certain symmetry. Specifically, it must be fixed under some rotation followed by inversion. So, the set of such colorings is exactly the union over all k of the fixed colorings under rotation by k followed by inversion.

So, the total number is the size of this union. To compute the size, we can use inclusion-exclusion:

Total = sum_{k=0}^7 fixed(k) - sum_{k1 < k2} fixed(k1, k2) + sum_{k1 <k2 <k3} fixed(k1,k2,k3)} - ... + (-1)^{m} sum_{all k's} fixed(all k's)}

But this seems computationally intensive because there are 8 rotations, leading to 2^8 -1 terms, which is 255 terms. That's impractical.

Alternatively, perhaps we can compute the total number of colorings fixed by at least one rotation by considering the least common multiple of the rotation orders.

Wait, but maybe it's better to model this using the principle that the number of colorings fixed by at least one rotation is equal to the sum_{d | 8} φ(d) * N(d), where N(d) is the number of colorings fixed by a rotation of order d.

Wait, no, perhaps not. Alternatively, perhaps for each divisor d of 8, we can compute the number of colorings fixed under rotation by d and inversion, and then use Möbius inversion to sum over the divisors.

Wait, maybe another approach: The colorings that are fixed under some rotation k followed by inversion are those that are periodic with period k and satisfy the alternation condition. So, perhaps for each divisor d of 8, we can find the number of colorings that are fixed under rotation by d and inversion.

Wait, let me think again. For each d dividing 8, the number of colorings fixed under rotation by d and inversion would be 2^{number of cycles}, where the number of cycles is d, as rotation by d would decompose into 8/d cycles, each of length d.

Wait, no, when we rotate by d, the number of cycles is gcd(d,8). Wait, no, when you rotate by k positions, the number of cycles is gcd(k,8). But in our earlier table, for each k, the number of cycles is gcd(k,8), and the length is 8/gcd(k,8).

Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of the rotation's order. The order of rotation k is 8/gcd(k,8). So, for each divisor d of 8, the number of k's with order d is φ(d). But perhaps I'm overcomplicating.

Wait, perhaps the total number of colorings fixed under some rotation k and inversion is equal to the sum over k=1 to 7 of fixed(k) minus the overlaps. But maybe it's easier to compute the total number using Möbius inversion.

Wait, another idea: Each coloring that is fixed under some rotation followed by inversion must have a certain periodicity. For example, if a coloring is fixed under rotation by k and inversion, then it must also be fixed under rotation by 2k, 3k, etc., modulo 8.

Wait, perhaps using the concept of necklaces with rotation symmetry. In combinatorics, a necklace is a sequence considered up to rotation, but here we have an additional inversion symmetry.

Wait, but perhaps the total number of such colorings is equal to the sum over all divisors d of 8 of μ(d) * something, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps it's better to compute the total number of colorings that are fixed under any rotation k and inversion, using Burnside's lemma.

Wait, Burnside's lemma says that the number of orbits is equal to the average number of fixed points. But in this case, the group is the cyclic group C8, and the action is rotation followed by inversion. So, the group has 8 elements: rotations by 0,1,2,...,7 positions, each followed by inversion.

Wait, no, actually, in this problem, the group is the cyclic group C8, and the action is rotation by k followed by inversion. So, each element of the group is a rotation by k and inversion.

So, the group has 8 elements, each corresponding to rotation by k and inversion, for k=0,1,2,...,7.

Then, according to Burnside's lemma, the number of colorings fixed by at least one group element is equal to the sum over each group element of the number of colorings fixed by that element, divided by the group size. Wait, no, Burnside's lemma counts the number of orbits, but here we want the number of colorings fixed by at least one group element. Hmm, perhaps not directly applicable.

Wait, no, actually Burnside's lemma counts the number of orbits as the average number of fixed points per group element. But here, we're interested in the number of colorings fixed by at least one group element, not the number of orbits.

Wait, so maybe the total number of such colorings is the sum over each group element of the number of colorings fixed by that element, minus the sum over pairs of group elements of the colorings fixed by both, and so on. But this inclusion-exclusion approach is complicated for 8 elements.

Alternatively, perhaps we can compute the total number as the sum over each group element g of Fix(g), where Fix(g) is the number of colorings fixed by g, minus the overlaps.

But this seems too time-consuming. Instead, maybe we can think of the colorings that are fixed under some rotation and inversion as those that are periodic with period d, where d divides 8, and satisfy the alternation condition.

Wait, perhaps for each divisor d of 8, we can compute the number of colorings that are fixed under rotation by d and inversion, and then sum appropriately.

Wait, let me try that.

For each divisor d of 8, which are 1,2,4,8, we can compute the number of colorings that are fixed under rotation by d and inversion.

Wait, but in our earlier table, for each k, the number of fixed colorings under rotation by k and inversion is as follows:

- For d=1 (k=1,3,5,7): Each has 2 fixed colorings. So, 4 values of k, each contributing 2, but these are different colorings.

Wait, no, perhaps for each d, the number of colorings fixed under rotation by d is 2^{number of cycles}, as previously.

Wait, for d=1, which corresponds to k=1,3,5,7, each has rotation order 8, but the fixed colorings under rotation by k and inversion are 2 for each k.

Wait, but perhaps for d=8, which is k=0. But as earlier, fixed colorings here are 0.

Wait, perhaps another approach: For each divisor d of 8, the number of colorings fixed under rotation by d and inversion is 2^{number of orbits under rotation by d}.

Wait, the number of orbits under rotation by d is d, since each orbit has length 8/d. So, for each d, the number of colorings fixed under rotation by d and inversion is 2^{d}.

Wait, no, that doesn't seem right. For example, for d=8, the number of orbits is 8, but the number of fixed colorings is 0, as seen earlier.

Wait, perhaps another way. The number of colorings fixed under rotation by k and inversion is 2^{number of cycles}, which is 2^{gcd(k,8)}.

Wait, because the number of cycles is gcd(k,8). So, for each k, the fixed colorings are 2^{gcd(k,8)}.

Wait, that seems promising.

Looking back at our earlier table:

- For k=0, gcd(0,8)=8, so 2^8=256, but we saw that fixed colorings are 0. So, this contradicts.

Hmm, maybe not. Alternatively, perhaps the number of fixed colorings is 2^{number of cycles}, which is 2^{gcd(k,8)}.

Wait, for k=0, the number of cycles is 8, so 2^8=256. But as we saw, for k=0, fixed colorings are 0 because you can't have color(i)=inverse(color(i)).

Wait, so perhaps that approach is incorrect.

Wait, perhaps another angle: Each rotation k corresponds to a permutation of the vertices, and the fixed colorings under rotation k and inversion are those colorings where for each vertex i, color(i) = inverse(color((i -k) mod 8)).

This condition must hold for all i. So, for each cycle in the permutation induced by rotation k, the coloring must alternate colors. So, for each cycle of even length, it's possible to assign colors in two different ways. For cycles of odd length, it's impossible, so no colorings are fixed.

Therefore, for a given k, the number of fixed colorings is 0 if any cycle has odd length, and 2^{c} where c is the number of cycles otherwise.

So, as earlier, for each k, if the cycle length is even (i.e., 8/gcd(k,8) is even), then the number of fixed colorings is 2^{gcd(k,8)}. Otherwise, it's 0.

Wait, let's check:

- For k=0: cycles are 8 cycles of length 1. 1 is odd, so fixed colorings=0.

- For k=1: gcd(1,8)=1, cycle length=8, which is even. So, fixed colorings=2^1=2.

- For k=2: gcd(2,8)=2, cycle length=4, even. Fixed colorings=2^2=4.

- For k=3: same as k=1, fixed=2.

- For k=4: gcd=4, cycle length=2, even. Fixed=2^4=16.

- For k=5: same as k=1, fixed=2.

- For k=6: same as k=2, fixed=4.

- For k=7: same as k=1, fixed=2.

So, the fixed colorings per k are as follows.

Now, the total number of colorings fixed by at least one rotation k and inversion is the union over all k of the fixed colorings. So, to compute this, we can use inclusion-exclusion, but it's complicated because some colorings are fixed by multiple k's.

Alternatively, perhaps the total number is equal to the sum over k of fixed(k) minus the sum over pairs (k1,k2) of fixed(k1, k2) + sum over triplets, etc. But this is impractical for 8 elements.

Wait, perhaps the only colorings fixed by multiple k's are the completely alternating colorings. For example, the two alternating colorings (RBRBRB... and BRBRBR...) are fixed under rotations by 1,3,5,7, right?

Because rotating by 1 and inverting would give the same coloring. Similarly for rotating by 3,5,7, you end up rotating by an odd number of steps, which, when combined with inversion, would still result in the same coloring.

Wait, let's see: Take the alternating RBRBRB... coloring. Rotating by 1 gives BRGB..., then inverting gives RBRGBR..., which is the same as the original. So, yes, this coloring is fixed under rotation by 1 and inversion. Similarly, rotating by 3 would rotate three positions, but since 3 is odd, the same logic applies.

So, the two alternating colorings are fixed under rotations by any odd k and inversion. How many such colorings are there? Only two.

So, in the sum over k of fixed(k), the two alternating colorings are counted multiple times. For each odd k (k=1,3,5,7), they are counted once each. So, each of these two colorings is counted four times in the sum.

Similarly, the other colorings fixed under some rotation may be fixed under multiple rotations as well.

Wait, let's see another example. The colorings fixed under rotation by 2 and inversion are those that alternate every two positions. For example, R, R, B, B, R, R, B, B. Rotating by 2 would shift two positions, then inverting would give B, B, R, R, B, B, R, R, which is not the same as the original, so perhaps such colorings don't exist. Wait, but according to our earlier table, for k=2, the number of fixed colorings is 4. So, perhaps there are four colorings that are fixed under rotation by 2 and inversion.

Wait, perhaps these are colorings where the color repeats every two positions, but in a way that satisfies the inversion condition. For example, R, R, B, B, R, R, B, B. Let's check:

Rotate by 2: the sequence becomes B, B, R, R, B, B, R, R.

Invert colors: R, R, B, B, R, R, B, B.

Which is the original. So, yes, this coloring is fixed. Similarly, R, B, R, B, R, B, R, B is fixed under rotation by 1 and inversion, but it's also fixed under rotation by 3,5,7, right?

Wait, no, because rotating by 2 and inverting gives the same as before, but rotating by 1 and inverting gives the other alternating coloring. So, perhaps it's better to think that each of these colorings is fixed under rotation by certain k's.

But perhaps the two alternating colorings are fixed under all odd rotations, while the others are fixed under only specific rotations.

So, to find the total number of colorings fixed under at least one rotation and inversion, I need to sum the fixed colorings for each k and subtract overlaps.

But this seems complicated. Alternatively, perhaps the total number is equal to the sum over each d dividing 8 of μ(d) * something, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach: Each coloring that is fixed under rotation by k and inversion must have a period that divides k. Or perhaps, the coloring must have a period that is a divisor of k. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the total number of such colorings is the sum over all possible d (divisors of 8) of the number of colorings fixed under rotation by d and inversion, divided by the number of times each is counted.

Wait, perhaps using Möbius inversion. The formula for the number of colorings fixed under rotation by d and inversion is 2^{number of cycles}, which is 2^{d'}, where d' = number of cycles, which is gcd(k,8).

Wait, but I'm getting stuck here. Maybe it's better to proceed step by step.

We have 8 rotations, each contributing a certain number of fixed colorings:

k=0: 0

k=1:2

k=2:4

k=3:2

k=4:16

k=5:2

k=6:4

k=7:2

So, the sum over all k is 0+2+4+2+16+2+4+2=32.

But this counts colorings that are fixed under multiple rotations multiple times. So, the actual number of unique colorings is less than 32.

We know that the two alternating colorings are each fixed under four rotations (k=1,3,5,7). So, each is counted four times in the sum.

Similarly, let's look at colorings fixed under rotation by 2 and inversion. There are four such colorings. Are they fixed under any other rotations besides k=2 and k=6?

Let me check one of them: R, R, B, B, R, R, B, B.

Rotating by 4 and inverting: Rotating by 4 gives B, B, R, R, B, B, R, R. Inverting gives R, R, B, B, R, R, B, B, which is the original. So, this coloring is fixed under rotation by 4 and inversion as well.

Wait, but according to our earlier table, for k=4, the number of fixed colorings is 16, which includes these colorings.

Wait, so the coloring R, R, B, B, R, R, B, B is fixed under rotation by 2,4,6, and possibly others?

Wait, let's check rotation by 2: the original is R,R,B,B,R,R,B,B.

Rotate by 2: B,B,R,R,B,B,R,R.

Invert: R,R,B,B,R,R,B,B. So, same as original.

Similarly, rotate by 4: R,R,B,B,R,R,B,B becomes B,B,R,R,B,B,R,R.

Invert: R,R,B,B,R,R,B,B. Same.

So, this coloring is fixed under rotation by 2,4,6, etc.

Wait, but let's check rotation by 1:

Rotate by 1: R becomes position 1, which was R. Then the sequence is R,B,B,R,R,B,B,R.

Invert: B,R,R,B,B,R,R,B.

Which is B,R,R,B,B,R,R,B, which is different from the original R,R,B,B,R,R,B,B.

So, this specific coloring is fixed under rotation by 2,4,6, and 8 (but 8 is identity, which we already saw gives 0 fixed colorings except for some cases).

Wait, no, rotation by 8 is same as 0, which gives no fixed colorings except for all red or all blue, which don't satisfy.

So, this specific coloring is fixed under rotations by 2,4,6, and inversion.

Wait, but in our earlier sum, the colorings fixed under rotation by 2 are 4, and those fixed under rotation by 4 are 16, which includes this coloring.

So, this coloring is being counted multiple times.

This suggests that the inclusion-exclusion principle is needed to compute the total number of unique colorings fixed under any rotation and inversion.

But this is getting too involved. Maybe another approach is needed.

Wait, perhaps the total number of such colorings is equal to the sum over all possible d (divisors of 8) of μ(d) * something, but perhaps I can find a formula.

Alternatively, perhaps I can model this as a necklace problem with rotation and reflection symmetries, but I'm not sure.

Wait, I think I'm overcomplicating. Let's go back to the problem. We need the probability that there exists a rotation such that after rotating, all blue vertices are now where reds were, and vice versa.

So, the condition is that the set of blue vertices is a rotation of the set of red vertices.

In other words, the set of blue vertices is a rotation of the set of red vertices, which is equivalent to saying that the set of blue vertices is a translate (rotation) of the set of red vertices.

So, for the octagon, the number of such colorings is equal to the number of subsets S of the 8 vertices such that S is a rotation of its complement. Because if S is a rotation of its complement, then rotating S by that amount will map it to the complement.

So, the problem reduces to counting the number of subsets S of an 8-element set such that S is a rotation of its complement.

Wait, that's a key insight. So, each such subset S must be a rotation of its complement. So, the number of such subsets is equal to the number of orbits under the rotation action where each subset is paired with its complement.

Wait, but how many such subsets S are there?

Each such subset S must satisfy that S = r(S'), where r is some rotation, and S' is the complement of S.

But perhaps it's better to think that for each rotation r, the subset S must be equal to r(S'). So, S ∪ r(S') = S, which implies that S is a fixed point under the rotation r composed with complement.

Wait, perhaps not. Alternatively, for a given rotation r, the number of subsets S such that S = r(S') is equal to 2^{number of orbits under rotation r}.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, for a specific rotation r, the condition S = r(S') implies that S is fixed under the transformation T_r, where T_r(S) = r(S').

So, the number of subsets fixed under T_r is equal to the number of S such that S = r(S').

Hmm, for each rotation r, the number of subsets S such that S = r(S') is equal to 2^{number of orbits under the rotation r's action on the power set}.

Wait, but perhaps each S must satisfy that for each vertex i, i is in S if and only if r(i) is not in S.

So, for each i, S(i) = not S(r(i)).

Which implies that S is a function that alternates along each cycle of the rotation r.

So, as before, for each cycle in the rotation, the colors must alternate, which is only possible if the cycle length is even.

Therefore, for each rotation r, the number of subsets S such that S = r(S') is equal to 0 if any cycle length is odd, and 2^{number of cycles} if all cycle lengths are even.

Which is exactly what we calculated earlier for the number of fixed colorings under rotation r followed by inversion.

So, the number of such subsets S is equal to the number of colorings fixed under rotation r and inversion, which is 2^{number of cycles} if all cycles have even length, else 0.

So, for each rotation r, the number is as we have in our earlier table.

Now, the total number of such subsets S is the number of subsets fixed under at least one rotation r.

But wait, each such subset S is counted once for each rotation r that satisfies S = r(S'). So, the same subset can be fixed under multiple rotations.

But in our problem, we only need to know that such a subset exists for at least one rotation. So, the number of subsets S that are fixed under at least one rotation r is equal to the union over all r of the fixed subsets.

So, to find the number of such subsets S, we can sum the fixed subsets for each r, minus the overlaps.

But again, this is complicated. Perhaps, instead, the number of such subsets S is equal to the number of colorings where S is a rotation of its complement, which is exactly the condition we're looking for.

But perhaps another approach: For each possible rotation r, the number of subsets S that are equal to r(S') is equal to 2^{number of cycles} as before. So, for each r, the number is:

- If rotation r has cycle length even: 2^{number of cycles}.

- Else: 0.

So, the total number of such subsets, counting overlaps, is sum_{r} 2^{number of cycles(r)}, where the sum is over all rotations r where all cycles have even length.

Wait, but this counts each subset S multiple times, once for each rotation r that maps S to its complement.

So, perhaps the actual number of unique subsets S is less than the total sum.

But maybe we can compute the total sum and then divide by the number of rotations that fix each subset.

But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the only subsets S that satisfy S = r(S') for some rotation r are those that are periodic with some period d, and for each d dividing 8, we can compute the number of such subsets.

Wait, but I'm not making progress here. Let me try a different approach.

Each subset S that is a rotation of its complement must have the same size as its complement, which implies that the size of S is 4, since the octagon has 8 vertices.

So, the number of such subsets S is a subset of the C(8,4)=70 subsets.

Now, the problem reduces to counting how many of these 70 subsets are rotations of their complements.

So, perhaps the number we're looking for is the number of subsets S of size 4 such that S is a rotation of S', its complement.

Alternatively, S is a rotation of S', meaning there exists a rotation r such that r(S) = S'.

But S' is the complement of S, so r(S) = S' implies that r(S) = all vertices not in S.

So, S is a rotation of its complement.

So, the number we need is the number of 4-element subsets S of the octagon's vertices such that S is a rotation of its complement.

So, how many such subsets S are there?

Let's think about the possible rotational symmetries.

The rotation that maps S to S' must be such that applying it to each element of S gives an element not in S.

So, for example, the two alternating colorings we discussed earlier are such that rotating by 1 maps S to S'.

Similarly, any subset that is periodic with a certain period will satisfy this condition.

Wait, perhaps another approach: The subsets S that are rotations of their complements are exactly those subsets that are fixed under some rotation composed with complementation.

So, for each rotation r, the number of subsets S fixed under r composed with complementation is equal to 2^{number of cycles}, as before.

But since we're looking for subsets S of size 4, we need to find among these fixed subsets how many have exactly 4 elements.

Wait, let's see. For example, when k=1 (rotation by 1), the fixed subsets under rotation by 1 and complementation are the two alternating subsets, each of size 4. So, these are valid.

Similarly, for k=2, the fixed subsets under rotation by 2 and complementation are the subsets that alternate every two positions. For example, {0,1,4,5}, but wait, rotating by 2 would map 0→2,1→3, etc. Wait, perhaps a better example is a subset that consists of two blocks of two consecutive vertices each separated by two positions. Like {0,1,4,5}, which when rotated by 2 becomes {2,3,6,7}, which is the complement if the original subset was {0,1,4,5}.

Wait, let's check: If S = {0,1,4,5}, then S' = {2,3,6,7}. Rotating S by 2 positions gives {2,3,6,7}, which is S'. So, yes, S is a rotation of its complement.

Similarly, another subset could be {0,2,4,6}, but rotating by 2 would give {2,4,6,0}, which is the same as S, so S'= {1,3,5,7}. So, that's not a rotation of S', unless rotation by 4.

Wait, perhaps not. Alternatively, let's consider S = {0,1,4,5}. Rotating by 2 gives {2,3,6,7}, which is S'. So, this works.

Similarly, S = {0,3,4,7} would rotate by 2 to {2,5,6,1}, but that's not the complement. Wait, maybe not.

Wait, perhaps it's better to model this as the number of such subsets being equal to the number of orbits under the rotation action where subsets are considered equivalent if they are rotations of each other. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the number of subsets S of size 4 that are rotations of their complements is equal to the number of such subsets fixed under rotation by k and inversion for some k.

But given the time I've spent, perhaps it's better to make an educated guess based on our earlier sum.

We found that the total sum over all rotations of fixed colorings is 32. But this counts subsets that are fixed under multiple rotations multiple times.

We know that the two alternating subsets are each counted four times (once for each odd rotation).

The other subsets fixed under rotation by 2 and 4 are counted twice each? Or perhaps more.

Wait, earlier for k=2, we have four fixed subsets. Each of these subsets is fixed under rotation by 2 and 6, I think.

Wait, let me take an example: S = {0,1,4,5}.

Rotate by 2: {2,3,6,7} = S'.

Rotate by 4: {4,5,0,1} = S.

Rotate by 6: {6,7,2,3} = S'.

So, this subset is fixed under rotations by 2 and 4 and 6 in the sense that rotating by 2 gives S', rotating by 4 gives S, and rotating by 6 gives S'.

So, in our earlier count, this subset would be counted for k=2,4,6.

Similarly, for k=2, the four fixed subsets are:

1. {0,1,4,5}

2. {0,3,4,7}

3. {1,2,5,6}

4. {2,3,6,7}

Wait, but actually, rotating {0,3,4,7} by 2 gives {2,5,6,1}, which is not the complement of {0,3,4,7}. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps the four fixed subsets under rotation by 2 are:

- {0,1,4,5}

- {0,1,6,7}

- {2,3,4,5}

- {2,3,6,7}

Wait, no, but in any case, each of these subsets is fixed under rotation by 2 and inversion, and also perhaps under other rotations.

But regardless, it's clear that the two alternating subsets are each counted four times, and the other subsets are counted multiple times as well.

Given the complexity, perhaps the total number of unique subsets S that are rotations of their complements is 8.

Wait, because for each divisor d of 8, we can have certain subsets. But that might not be correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the number is 8, considering the two alternating subsets and others.

Wait, another approach: The two alternating subsets are the only ones fixed under rotation by 1,3,5,7 and inversion.

Then, for rotation by 2, we have four subsets fixed, which are {0,1,4,5}, {0,3,4,7}, {1,2,5,6}, {2,3,6,7}. Wait, but earlier, when we checked, rotating {0,1,4,5} by 2 gives S', which is {2,3,6,7}, which is another fixed subset.

Similarly, rotating {0,3,4,7} by 2 gives {2,5,6,1}, which is another fixed subset. So, each of these four subsets is fixed under rotation by 2 and inversion, but are they unique?

Yes, they are four distinct subsets.

Similarly, for rotation by 4, the number of fixed subsets is 16, but most of them are not size 4. Wait, no, because the subsets must have size 4 to be complements of each other.

Wait, actually, when considering subsets of size 4, the number of subsets fixed under rotation by 4 and inversion would be those that are symmetric under rotation by 4, which swaps vertices 0↔4, 1↔5, 2↔6, 3↔7.

So, the fixed subsets under rotation by 4 and inversion must satisfy that if vertex i is in S, then vertex i+4 is not in S.

So, such subsets are determined by their first four elements, but ensuring that no two elements are in the same swapped pair.

Wait, but since rotation by 4 is two swaps: 0↔4, 1↔5, 2↔6, 3↔7.

So, for a subset to be fixed under rotation by 4 and inversion, it must include exactly one from each pair {0,4}, {1,5}, {2,6}, {3,7}.

Since the subset size is 4, we choose one from each of four pairs, giving 2^4=16 subsets. But these are all possible subsets fixed under rotation by 4 and inversion, regardless of size.

But we're only interested in subsets of size 4. So, the number of such subsets would be C(4,4) =1 for each choice, but wait, no, each pair contributes a choice of including one element or the other. To get a subset of size 4, we must choose exactly one from each pair, so the number is 2^4=16, but each of these subsets has size 4. Because each choice selects one from each of the four pairs, leading to four elements.

So, for rotation by 4, the number of fixed subsets S of size 4 is 16.

But wait, in our earlier count, the fixed colorings for k=4 was 16, which includes all subsets fixed under rotation by 4 and inversion, regardless of size. But since we're only interested in subsets of size 4, all 16 are valid.

But wait, no. Because the condition for a coloring to be fixed under rotation by 4 and inversion is that color(i) = inverse(color(i+4)). So, for each pair {i, i+4}, one must be red and the other blue. So, the subset S must include exactly one from each pair, leading to 2^4=16 subsets, each of size 4.

So, the four subsets fixed under rotation by 2 and inversion are a subset of these 16.

Similarly, the two alternating subsets are also included in these 16.

Wait, no. The two alternating subsets are fixed under rotation by 1,3,5,7 and inversion, not necessarily under rotation by 4.

Wait, for example, the subset {0,1,4,5} is fixed under rotation by 2 and inversion, but not under rotation by 4 and inversion, because rotating {0,1,4,5} by 4 gives {4,5,0,1}, which is the same subset, but inverting would require that color(0) = inverse(color(4)), which in this case, both are red (assuming 0 and 4 are red). Wait, no, in the subset {0,1,4,5}, 0,1,4,5 are blue, say, and 2,3,6,7 are red. Rotating by 4 would give {4,5,0,1}, which is the same subset, but then inversion would require that color(4) = inverse(color(0)). But color(4) is blue, and color(0) is blue, so this would require blue = inverse(blue), which is red, which is a contradiction. Therefore, this subset is not fixed under rotation by 4 and inversion.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake earlier. Let me clarify:

A subset S is fixed under rotation by r and inversion if rotating S by r and inverting gives S. So, in terms of elements, for each i, if i is in S, then (i + r) mod 8 is not in S.

So, for rotation by 4, the condition is that for each i, if i is in S, then (i +4) mod 8 is not in S.

Which means that S contains exactly one element from each pair {i, i+4}.

So, the number of such subsets S is 2^4=16, each choosing one from each of the four pairs {0,4}, {1,5}, {2,6}, {3,7}.

Each of these subsets S has size 4, since they pick one from each of four pairs.

So, the number of subsets fixed under rotation by 4 and inversion is 16.

Similarly, the subsets fixed under rotation by 2 and inversion are those where for each i, if i is in S, then (i +2) mod8 is not in S.

Which would require that S includes either all even positions or all odd positions, but no, that's not correct.

Wait, for rotation by 2, the condition is that if i is in S, then (i +2) mod8 is not in S. So, the subset must not contain any two elements that are two apart. So, it's like a no-two-consecutive rule every two steps.

But wait, this is similar to a binary string of length 8 with no two 1's at distance 2.

But perhaps the number of such subsets is 4, as we saw earlier.

Similarly, the subsets fixed under rotation by 1 and inversion are the two alternating subsets.

So, putting it all together, the total number of subsets S of size 4 that are fixed under some rotation r and inversion is:

- Two subsets fixed under rotation by 1,3,5,7.

- Four subsets fixed under rotation by 2 and 6.

- Sixteen subsets fixed under rotation by 4.

Wait, but this seems to overcount because some subsets are fixed under multiple rotations.

Wait, but the two alternating subsets are fixed under rotations by 1,3,5,7, which are four rotations each.

The four subsets fixed under rotation by 2 and 6 are two each, perhaps?

Wait, no, for k=2, we have four subsets fixed, and for k=6, another four? Or are they the same?

Wait, perhaps the four subsets fixed under rotation by 2 and inversion are the same as those fixed under rotation by 6 and inversion, because rotation by 6 is equivalent to rotation by -2.

So, perhaps the four subsets are fixed under both k=2 and k=6.

Similarly, the 16 subsets fixed under rotation by 4 are fixed under rotation by 4 and inversion.

So, the total unique subsets would be:

- Two alternating subsets.

- Four subsets fixed under rotation by 2 and 6.

- Sixteen subsets fixed under rotation by 4.

But wait, this would give 2 + 4 + 16 = 22 subsets, but some of these might overlap.

Wait, no, the two alternating subsets are also included in the 16 subsets fixed under rotation by 4.

Because, for example, the subset {0,1,4,5} is fixed under rotation by 2, but not under rotation by 4.

Wait, no, earlier I saw that {0,1,4,5} is not fixed under rotation by 4 and inversion. So, perhaps the 16 subsets fixed under rotation by 4 are distinct from the four subsets fixed under rotation by 2.

Similarly, the two alternating subsets are distinct from all others.

So, the total number of unique subsets S would be 2 (alternating) + 4 (fixed under rotation by 2) + 16 (fixed under rotation by 4) = 22.

But wait, this can't be right because the total number of 4-element subsets is 70, and 22 seems too low.

Wait, perhaps I'm making a mistake here. Let's think differently.

Each rotation r can fix some subsets S such that S = r(S'). For each rotation r, we can compute the number of such subsets S.

As earlier, for each rotation r, the number is 2^{number of cycles} if all cycle lengths are even, else 0.

So, for each rotation r, the number of such subsets S is:

- For r=0: 0.

- For r=1,3,5,7 (each with cycle length 8): 2 subsets each.

- For r=2,6 (each with cycle length 4): 4 subsets each.

- For r=4 (cycle length 2): 16 subsets.

So, the total number of such subsets S, counting duplicates, is:

- r=1: 2

- r=3: 2

- r=5: 2

- r=7: 2

- r=2:4

- r=6:4

- r=4:16

Adding these up: 2+2+2+2+4+4+16=32.

But this counts each subset S as many times as the number of rotations r for which S = r(S').

So, to find the actual number of unique subsets S, we can use inclusion-exclusion.

But perhaps the total number is 32, but with overlaps, so the unique number is less.

But I'm stuck. Maybe I can compute the number of unique subsets S by considering the orbits.

Each subset S is counted once for each rotation r that maps S to its complement.

The two alternating subsets are each counted four times (for r=1,3,5,7).

The four subsets fixed under rotation by 2 and 6 are each counted twice (for r=2 and r=6).

The 16 subsets fixed under rotation by 4 are each counted once (only for r=4).

So, total counts: 2*4 + 4*2 + 16*1 = 8 + 8 +16=32, which matches our earlier sum.

So, the number of unique subsets S is 2 + 4 + 16 =22.

Wait, but that can't be right because 22 is much less than 70, and the two alternating subsets are included, as well as others.

Wait, but let me check: Are the 16 subsets fixed under rotation by 4 and inversion all unique and not overlapping with the others?

Yes, because the subsets fixed under rotation by 4 are those that select one element from each pair {0,4}, {1,5}, {2,6}, {3,7}, leading to 16 distinct subsets of size 4.

Similarly, the four subsets fixed under rotation by 2 are distinct from these.

And the two alternating subsets are also distinct.

So, the total number of unique subsets is 2 + 4 + 16 = 22.

Wait, but I thought earlier that the two alternating subsets were included in the 16 subsets fixed under rotation by 4, but apparently not. Let me check:

Take the alternating subset {0,2,4,6}.

Applying rotation by 4 gives {4,6,0,2}, which is the same subset. Inverting would require that each element is not in S, which is not the case. So, this subset is not fixed under rotation by 4 and inversion. So, it's not included in the 16 subsets fixed under rotation by 4.

Similarly, the other alternating subset {1,3,5,7} is not fixed under rotation by 4 and inversion.

So, the 16 subsets fixed under rotation by 4 do not include the two alternating subsets. Therefore, the total number of unique subsets S is indeed 2 + 4 + 16 =22.

Thus, the number of favorable colorings is 22.

Wait, but no, because each subset S corresponds to a coloring where the subset is blue and its complement is red. So, each subset S gives exactly one coloring. So, the number of colorings is equal to the number of such subsets S, which is 22.

But wait, each subset S is size 4, and corresponds to a unique coloring where S is blue and S' is red.

So, the number of favorable colorings is 22.

But earlier, I thought the sum over all rotations was 32, which counts each subset multiple times. So, the actual number is 22.

Wait, but that would make the probability 22/256 = 11/128.

But let me check: 22 is the number of subsets S that are rotations of their complements, so the number of colorings is 22. Therefore, the probability is 22/256, which simplifies to 11/128. So, m=11, n=128, which are coprime. Then, m+n=139.

But wait, I'm not sure if this is correct. Let me check again.

Wait, the two alternating subsets: Each is counted four times in the sum.

The four subsets fixed under rotation by 2: Each is counted twice.

The 16 subsets fixed under rotation by 4: Each is counted once.

Total subsets S: 2 + 4 + 16 =22.

Therefore, the probability is 22/256=11/128.

Thus, the answer would be 11 + 128=139.

Wait, but I'm not entirely confident. Let me double-check.

The two alternating subsets are fixed under four rotations each, contributing 2 subsets.

The four subsets fixed under rotation by 2 are fixed under two rotations each, contributing 4 subsets.

The 16 subsets fixed under rotation by 4 are fixed under one rotation each, contributing 16 subsets.

So, total unique subsets S is 2 +4 +16=22.

Thus, the probability is 22/256=11/128.

So, m=11, n=128, m+n=139.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The probability that the octagon can be rotated so that all blue vertices align with the original red vertices is $\frac{11}{128}$. Thus, $m + n = 11 + 128 = 139$.

$\boxed{139}$
