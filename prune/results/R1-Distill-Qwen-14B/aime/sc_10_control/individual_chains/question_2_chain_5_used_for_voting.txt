Alright, so I have this problem here. Let me read it again and try to understand what it's asking. 

We have three points: O at (0,0), A at (1/2, 0), and B at (0, sqrt(3)/2). These are in the coordinate plane. Then there's this family F of segments PQ, each of unit length, lying in the first quadrant. P is on the x-axis and Q is on the y-axis. 

The problem says there's a unique point C on segment AB, not equal to A or B, that doesn't belong to any segment from F except for AB itself. We need to find OC squared, which is the square of the distance from the origin to point C. Then express that as a fraction p/q where p and q are coprime, and find p + q.

Hmm. Okay, let me try to visualize this. 

First, O is the origin. A is halfway between O and (1,0), but not exactly halfway because (1/2, 0) is one unit from O. Wait, actually, the distance from O to A is 1/2. Similarly, B is at (0, sqrt(3)/2). Let me compute the distance from O to B: it's sqrt( (0)^2 + (sqrt(3)/2)^2 ) = sqrt(3/4) = sqrt(3)/2, which is approximately 0.866. So OA is 1/2 and OB is sqrt(3)/2.

Wait, but AB is a segment connecting A and B. So I think I should find the equation of AB first. Let me find the coordinates of A and B:

A is (1/2, 0), B is (0, sqrt(3)/2). So the line AB can be found using the two-point form.

The slope of AB is (sqrt(3)/2 - 0)/(0 - 1/2) = (sqrt(3)/2) / (-1/2) = -sqrt(3). So the equation is y = -sqrt(3) x + c. Plugging in point A (1/2, 0):

0 = -sqrt(3)*(1/2) + c => c = sqrt(3)/2. So the equation of AB is y = -sqrt(3) x + sqrt(3)/2.

Wait, let me check that:

At x = 0, y should be sqrt(3)/2, which matches point B. At x = 1/2, y = -sqrt(3)*(1/2) + sqrt(3)/2 = 0, which matches point A. So yes, correct.

Now, the family F is all segments PQ where PQ is of unit length, P is on the x-axis, Q on the y-axis, and both P and Q are in the first quadrant. So each PQ is a line segment from (p,0) to (0,q), with p and q positive, and the distance between P and Q is 1. 

So, the distance formula gives sqrt( p^2 + q^2 ) = 1 => p^2 + q^2 = 1.

So for each such segment PQ, p and q satisfy p^2 + q^2 =1, and p, q >0.

So, the family F is all such segments PQ in the first quadrant with P on x-axis, Q on y-axis, and PQ =1.

The problem says that there's a unique point C on AB (other than A and B) which is not on any other segment from F besides AB. So C is only on AB and no other PQ from F. We need to find OC^2.

So, to find C, perhaps we can think about the envelope of all these segments PQ, and see where AB intersects this envelope. But wait, since C is on AB and only lies on AB among all these F's, maybe it's the point where AB is tangent to the envelope of F.

Alternatively, perhaps we can parametrize each PQ and find where AB intersects these PQs, and then find the condition that C is the only such intersection point.

Wait, but the problem says that C is on AB and not on any other PQ from F except AB itself. So, for all other PQs in F, they don't pass through C.

Therefore, C is the point on AB where AB is only intersected by itself (among F) and no other PQ from F. So, perhaps C is the point where AB is tangent to the envelope of F.

Hmm, let's think about the envelope of the family F.

The family F consists of segments PQ where P is (p,0), Q is (0,q), with p^2 + q^2 =1.

So the equation of PQ is x/p + y/q = 1. So the equation is x/p + y/( (sqrt(1 - p^2)) ) = 1.

But we can write it as x/p + y/sqrt(1 - p^2) =1, where p is in (0,1).

Wait, but F is all such lines. The envelope of these lines is the curve that is tangent to each member of F.

The envelope can be found by solving the system:

x/p + y/sqrt(1 - p^2) = 1

and

d/dp (x/p + y/sqrt(1 - p^2)) = 0

So, let me compute the derivative.

First, the equation is F(p, x, y) = x/p + y/sqrt(1 - p^2) - 1 = 0.

The derivative with respect to p is:

dF/dp = -x / p^2 + (y * (1/2)(1 - p^2)^(-3/2) * 2p) ) = 0

Simplify:

-x/p^2 + (y p) / ( (1 - p^2)^(3/2) ) = 0

So,

x/p^2 = (y p) / ( (1 - p^2)^(3/2) )

Let me write this as:

x = y p^3 / ( (1 - p^2)^(3/2) )

Hmm, that looks complicated. Alternatively, let's express in terms of p.

From the first equation:

x/p + y / sqrt(1 - p^2) = 1

Let me denote t = p. Then, we have:

x = t*(1 - y / sqrt(1 - t^2))

But this might not be helpful.

Alternatively, let's try to express x and y in terms of p.

Let me let x = p * (1 - something), but perhaps better to parametrize in terms of an angle.

Wait, since p^2 + q^2 =1, perhaps we can parametrize p = cosθ, q = sinθ, where θ is from 0 to π/2.

Then, the equation of PQ is x / cosθ + y / sinθ =1.

So, the equation is x secθ + y cscθ =1.

Then, to find the envelope, we can use the method where we take F(θ, x, y) = x secθ + y cscθ -1 =0, and dF/dθ =0.

So,

dF/dθ = -x secθ tanθ + (-y cscθ cotθ) =0

So,

- x secθ tanθ - y cscθ cotθ =0

Multiply both sides by cosθ sinθ to eliminate denominators:

- x sinθ tanθ - y cosθ cotθ =0

But tanθ = sinθ / cosθ, cotθ = cosθ / sinθ.

So,

- x sinθ (sinθ / cosθ) - y cosθ (cosθ / sinθ) =0

Simplify:

- x (sin^2θ / cosθ ) - y (cos^2θ / sinθ ) =0

Multiply both sides by sinθ cosθ to eliminate denominators:

- x sin^3θ - y cos^3θ =0

So,

x sin^3θ + y cos^3θ =0

But since x and y are positive (in the first quadrant), and sinθ, cosθ are positive in (0, π/2), this would imply that x and y must be zero, which they aren't. So perhaps I made a mistake in the differentiation.

Wait, let's go back. The derivative dF/dθ is:

d/dθ [x secθ + y cscθ -1] = x secθ tanθ + (-y cscθ cotθ) =0

Wait, no: derivative of secθ is secθ tanθ, so:

dF/dθ = x secθ tanθ - y cscθ cotθ =0

So,

x secθ tanθ = y cscθ cotθ

Let me write that as:

x / cosθ * (sinθ / cosθ) ) = y / sinθ * (cosθ / sinθ )

Simplify:

x (sinθ / cos²θ ) = y (cosθ / sin²θ )

So,

x sinθ / cos²θ = y cosθ / sin²θ

Cross-multiplied:

x sin^3θ = y cos^3θ

So,

x = y (cos^3θ / sin^3θ )

So,

x = y cot^3θ

Wait, that's better. So, x = y cot^3θ.

Now, from the original equation:

x secθ + y cscθ =1

Substitute x = y cot^3θ:

y cot^3θ * secθ + y cscθ =1

Let me express everything in terms of sinθ and cosθ.

cotθ = cosθ / sinθ, so cot^3θ = cos^3θ / sin^3θ

secθ = 1 / cosθ, cscθ = 1 / sinθ

So,

y (cos^3θ / sin^3θ ) * (1 / cosθ ) + y (1 / sinθ ) =1

Simplify:

y (cos²θ / sin^3θ ) + y (1 / sinθ ) =1

Factor out y / sinθ:

y / sinθ [ cos²θ / sin²θ + 1 ] =1

Compute the bracket:

cos²θ / sin²θ + 1 = (cos²θ + sin²θ ) / sin²θ = 1 / sin²θ.

So,

y / sinθ * (1 / sin²θ ) = y / sin^3θ =1

Thus,

y = sin^3θ

Then, from x = y cot^3θ:

x = sin^3θ * (cosθ / sinθ )^3 = sin^3θ * cos^3θ / sin^3θ = cos^3θ

So, we have x = cos^3θ, y = sin^3θ.

Therefore, the envelope is the parametric curve:

x = cos^3θ, y = sin^3θ.

So, the envelope is the astroid given by x^(2/3) + y^(2/3) =1.

Wait, let me check that. If x = cos^3θ, y = sin^3θ, then x^(2/3) = cos²θ, y^(2/3) = sin²θ. So cos²θ + sin²θ =1, which gives x^(2/3) + y^(2/3) =1. Yes, that's right. So the envelope is the astroid x^(2/3) + y^(2/3) =1.

So, the family F of segments PQ is the set of lines tangent to this astroid.

Now, our point C is on AB and lies only on AB among all segments in F. So, perhaps C is the point where AB is tangent to the astroid? Because if AB is tangent to the astroid, then C would be the only point of intersection between AB and the astroid, hence the only point where AB meets any PQ from F except for itself.

Wait, but AB is one of the segments in F. Wait, no. Wait, AB is the segment from A(1/2, 0) to B(0, sqrt(3)/2). Let me check if AB is in F.

Wait, F consists of segments PQ where P is on x-axis, Q on y-axis, and PQ has length 1. So, let's compute the length of AB.

Point A is (1/2, 0), B is (0, sqrt(3)/2). So the distance AB is sqrt( (1/2)^2 + (sqrt(3)/2)^2 ) = sqrt(1/4 + 3/4 ) = sqrt(1) =1. So AB is a segment of length 1, lying in the first quadrant with P on x-axis and Q on y-axis. So AB is in F. So AB is one of the PQ segments.

So the problem says that C is on AB, but does not belong to any other segment from F. So, C is the point where AB is tangent to the astroid. Because if AB is tangent at C, then it only intersects the astroid at C, so C is the only point on AB that lies on any PQ in F, since all other PQs are tangent to the astroid at other points, so AB would only intersect them at C.

Wait, but wait. The astroid is the envelope of all the PQs, so each PQ is tangent to the astroid at one point. So AB is one such PQ, tangent at some point, which would be the only point where AB meets the astroid. So that point would be our C.

So, to find C, we can find the point where AB is tangent to the astroid x^(2/3) + y^(2/3) =1.

So, we have the equation of AB: y = -sqrt(3)x + sqrt(3)/2.

We can substitute this into the astroid equation and find where they are tangent, meaning the system has exactly one solution.

So, let's substitute y from AB into the astroid equation.

So,

x^(2/3) + ( (-sqrt(3) x + sqrt(3)/2 ) )^(2/3) =1

Hmm, that looks complicated. Maybe instead of substituting, we can use the condition for tangency.

Alternatively, since AB is tangent to the astroid at point C, the gradient of AB should be equal to the derivative of the astroid at point C.

The slope of AB is -sqrt(3). So, we can compute the derivative of the astroid at a general point (x, y) and set it equal to -sqrt(3). Then solve for x and y, ensuring that the point lies on AB.

Let's compute dy/dx for the astroid.

Given x^(2/3) + y^(2/3) =1.

Differentiating both sides:

(2/3) x^(-1/3) + (2/3) y^(-1/3) dy/dx =0

So,

dy/dx = - [ (2/3) x^(-1/3) ] / [ (2/3) y^(-1/3) ) ] = - (y^(1/3) ) / (x^(1/3) )

So, dy/dx = - (y/x )^(1/3 )

We want dy/dx = -sqrt(3)

So,

- (y/x )^(1/3 ) = - sqrt(3 )

Simplify:

(y/x )^(1/3 ) = sqrt(3 )

Cube both sides:

y/x = (sqrt(3 ))^3 = 3^(3/2 ) = 3*sqrt(3 )

So,

y = 3*sqrt(3 ) x

But the point (x, y) lies on AB, whose equation is y = -sqrt(3)x + sqrt(3)/2.

So,

3*sqrt(3) x = -sqrt(3) x + sqrt(3)/2

Let me solve for x.

Bring -sqrt(3)x to the left:

3*sqrt(3)x + sqrt(3)x = sqrt(3)/2

Factor sqrt(3)x:

sqrt(3)x (3 +1 ) = sqrt(3)/2

So,

sqrt(3) x *4 = sqrt(3)/2

Divide both sides by sqrt(3):

4x = 1/2 => x=1/8.

Then y = 3*sqrt(3) * (1/8 ) = (3 sqrt(3))/8.

So, point C is at (1/8, 3 sqrt(3)/8 ).

Wait, let me check if this point lies on AB.

Equation of AB: y = -sqrt(3)x + sqrt(3)/2.

Substitute x=1/8:

y = -sqrt(3)*(1/8) + sqrt(3)/2 = (-sqrt(3)/8 ) + (4 sqrt(3)/8 ) = (3 sqrt(3))/8.

Yes, that matches. So, point C is (1/8, 3 sqrt(3)/8 ).

Now, we need to compute OC squared, which is (1/8)^2 + (3 sqrt(3)/8 )^2.

Compute each term:

(1/8)^2 = 1/64.

(3 sqrt(3)/8 )^2 = 9 *3 /64 = 27/64.

So, sum is 1/64 +27/64=28/64=7/16.

So, OC^2=7/16.

So p=7, q=16, which are coprime. So p+q=23.

Wait, but let me double-check. Did I make any mistake in the calculations?

Wait, when I set y=3 sqrt(3) x and substituted into AB's equation:

3 sqrt(3) x = -sqrt(3)x + sqrt(3)/2.

Then,

3 sqrt(3)x + sqrt(3)x = sqrt(3)/2.

That gives 4 sqrt(3) x = sqrt(3)/2.

Divide both sides by sqrt(3):

4x=1/2 => x=1/8.

Yes, correct.

Then y=3 sqrt(3)*(1/8)=3 sqrt(3)/8. Correct.

Then OC squared: (1/8)^2 + (3 sqrt(3)/8)^2.

Which is 1/64 + 27/64=28/64=7/16.

Yes, correct.

So, the answer is 7 +16=23.

To solve the problem, we first identify the points and the family of segments. Points \( O(0,0) \), \( A\left(\frac{1}{2}, 0\right) \), and \( B\left(0, \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right) \) form the segment \( AB \). The equation of \( AB \) is found to be \( y = -\sqrt{3}x + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \).

The family \( \mathcal{F} \) consists of segments \( \overline{PQ} \) of unit length with \( P \) on the \( x \)-axis and \( Q \) on the \( y \)-axis. These segments are tangent to the astroid \( x^{2/3} + y^{2/3} = 1 \). The point \( C \) on \( AB \), other than \( A \) and \( B \), that does not lie on any other segment from \( \mathcal{F} \) is the point where \( AB \) is tangent to this astroid.

To find \( C \), we compute the derivative of the astroid at a general point \( (x, y) \), which gives \( \frac{dy}{dx} = -\left(\frac{y}{x}\right)^{1/3} \). Setting this equal to the slope of \( AB \), \( -\sqrt{3} \), we solve for \( x \) and \( y \). Substituting into the equation of \( AB \), we find \( C \) at \( \left(\frac{1}{8}, \frac{3\sqrt{3}}{8}\right) \).

The distance \( OC^2 \) is calculated as:
\[
OC^2 = \left(\frac{1}{8}\right)^2 + \left(\frac{3\sqrt{3}}{8}\right)^2 = \frac{1}{64} + \frac{27}{64} = \frac{28}{64} = \frac{7}{16}.
\]
Thus, \( p = 7 \) and \( q = 16 \), leading to \( p + q = 23 \).

The final answer is \(\boxed{23}\).
