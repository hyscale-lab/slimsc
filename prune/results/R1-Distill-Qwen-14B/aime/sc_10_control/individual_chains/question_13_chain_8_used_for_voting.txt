Okay, so I have this math problem here about Aya's morning walks. Let me try to figure it out step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll take it slow.

Alright, so Aya walks 9 kilometers every morning. She stops at a coffee shop afterwards, and her walking speed affects how long her walk takes, but she spends t minutes in the coffee shop each time. The problem gives me two scenarios with different speeds and times, and then asks me to find the time when she walks at a speed of s + 1/2 km/h.

Let me write down what I know:

1. First scenario: speed = s km/h, time taken = 4 hours, which includes t minutes in the coffee shop.
2. Second scenario: speed = s + 2 km/h, time taken = 2 hours and 24 minutes, which also includes t minutes in the coffee shop.

Wait, but time taken includes both walking and the coffee shop. So the total time is walking time plus t minutes. I need to find the walking time separately for each scenario.

Let me convert all times to minutes to make it easier. Because the coffee shop time is given in minutes, I should probably convert the total time to minutes as well.

First scenario:
- Total time = 4 hours = 4 * 60 = 240 minutes.
- This includes walking time plus t minutes.

Second scenario:
- Total time = 2 hours 24 minutes. 2 hours is 120 minutes, plus 24 minutes is 144 minutes.
- Again, this includes walking time plus t minutes.

So, for both scenarios, the walking time plus t equals the total time given.

I can set up equations for each scenario.

Let me denote walking time as Tw.

So, for the first scenario:
Tw = (9 km) / (s km/h) = 9/s hours.

But wait, the total time is 4 hours, which is 240 minutes. So, the walking time plus t minutes equals 240 minutes.

Similarly, the walking time in the first case is 9/s hours. But to add it to t, which is in minutes, I should convert the walking time to minutes.

1 hour = 60 minutes, so walking time = (9/s) * 60 minutes.

So, equation 1:
(9/s) * 60 + t = 240.

Similarly, for the second scenario:
Speed = s + 2 km/h.
Walking time = 9 / (s + 2) hours = (9 / (s + 2)) * 60 minutes.

Total time is 144 minutes, so equation 2:
(9/(s + 2)) * 60 + t = 144.

Now I have two equations:

1. (540/s) + t = 240
2. (540/(s + 2)) + t = 144

Hmm, I can subtract equation 2 from equation 1 to eliminate t.

So, (540/s + t) - (540/(s + 2) + t) = 240 - 144.

Simplify the left side:
540/s - 540/(s + 2) = 96.

So, 540*(1/s - 1/(s + 2)) = 96.

Let me compute 1/s - 1/(s + 2) = (s + 2 - s)/(s(s + 2)) ) = 2/(s(s + 2)).

So, 540*(2/(s(s + 2))) = 96.

Simplify:

(1080)/(s(s + 2)) = 96.

Multiply both sides by s(s + 2):

1080 = 96 * s(s + 2).

Divide both sides by 96:

1080 / 96 = s(s + 2)

Let me compute 1080 divided by 96.

Hmm, 96 * 11 = 1056, 96*11.25 = 1080, because 96 * 0.25 =24, so 1056 + 24 = 1080.

So, 1080 /96 =11.25 = s(s +2).

Therefore:

s^2 + 2s =11.25.

Bring 11.25 to the left:

s^2 + 2s -11.25=0.

This is a quadratic equation. Let's solve for s.

The quadratic formula: s = [-b ± sqrt(b^2 -4ac)]/(2a).

Here, a=1, b=2, c=-11.25.

So,

s = [-2 ± sqrt( (2)^2 -4*1*(-11.25) ) ]/(2*1)

= [-2 ± sqrt(4 +45)]/2

= [-2 ± sqrt(49)]/2

= [-2 ±7]/2.

So, two solutions:

s = (-2 +7)/2 =5/2=2.5 km/h

s = (-2 -7)/2= -9/2= -4.5 km/h.

But speed can't be negative, so s=2.5 km/h.

So, s is 2.5 km/h.

Now, we need to find the time when she walks at s + 1/2 km/h.

s + 1/2 =2.5 +0.5=3 km/h.

So, her speed is 3 km/h.

The distance is still 9 km.

Time taken walking is 9 /3 =3 hours.

But wait, that's just the walking time. The total time includes t minutes in the coffee shop.

But I need to find t first to compute the total time.

So, let's use one of the earlier equations to find t.

Let me take equation 1:

(540/s) + t =240.

s=2.5, so 540/2.5 =?

540 divided by 2.5: 540 /2.5 = (540 *2)/5=1080/5=216 minutes.

So,

216 + t =240.

t=240 -216=24 minutes.

So, she spends 24 minutes in the coffee shop.

Now, when she walks at 3 km/h, the walking time is 3 hours, which is 180 minutes.

So, the total time including coffee shop is 180 +24=204 minutes.

Wait, that's 204 minutes. Let me convert that to hours and minutes if needed, but the question asks for the number of minutes, so 204 minutes.

Wait, let me double-check everything.

First, s=2.5 km/h.

First scenario: 9 km at 2.5 km/h. Time is 9/2.5 = 3.6 hours. 3.6 *60=216 minutes. Add t=24 minutes, total 240 minutes (4 hours). Correct.

Second scenario: speed is 4.5 km/h (s +2). 9/4.5=2 hours. 2 hours is 120 minutes. Add t=24, total 144 minutes (2h24m). Correct.

So, when she walks at 3 km/h, time is 9/3=3 hours=180 minutes. Add t=24, total 204 minutes.

So, the answer is 204 minutes.

Aya walks 9 kilometers at different speeds, with the total time including coffee shop breaks. Using the given scenarios, we set up equations to solve for her walking speed \( s \) and coffee shop time \( t \).

1. **First Scenario**:
   - Speed: \( s \) km/h
   - Total time: 4 hours = 240 minutes
   - Walking time: \( \frac{9}{s} \) hours = \( \frac{540}{s} \) minutes
   - Equation: \( \frac{540}{s} + t = 240 \)

2. **Second Scenario**:
   - Speed: \( s + 2 \) km/h
   - Total time: 2 hours 24 minutes = 144 minutes
   - Walking time: \( \frac{9}{s + 2} \) hours = \( \frac{540}{s + 2} \) minutes
   - Equation: \( \frac{540}{s + 2} + t = 144 \)

Subtracting the second equation from the first eliminates \( t \):
\[
\frac{540}{s} - \frac{540}{s + 2} = 96
\]
Simplifying:
\[
540 \left( \frac{2}{s(s + 2)} \right) = 96 \quad \Rightarrow \quad \frac{1080}{s(s + 2)} = 96
\]
\[
s(s + 2) = \frac{1080}{96} = 11.25
\]
Solving the quadratic equation \( s^2 + 2s - 11.25 = 0 \) gives \( s = 2.5 \) km/h (since speed cannot be negative).

Using \( s = 2.5 \) km/h in the first equation:
\[
\frac{540}{2.5} + t = 240 \quad \Rightarrow \quad 216 + t = 240 \quad \Rightarrow \quad t = 24 \text{ minutes}.
\]

When walking at \( s + \frac{1}{2} = 3 \) km/h:
- Walking time: \( \frac{9}{3} = 3 \) hours = 180 minutes.
- Total time including coffee shop: \( 180 + 24 = 204 \) minutes.

The final answer is \(\boxed{204}\).
