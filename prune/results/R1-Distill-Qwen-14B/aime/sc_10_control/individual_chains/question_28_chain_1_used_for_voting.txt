Okay, so I've got this tetrahedron ABCD with some specific edge lengths, and I need to find the distance from the incenter (the point equidistant from all faces) to each face. The answer needs to be in the form m√n/p, where m, n, p are positive integers, m and p are coprime, and n is square-free. Then, I have to find m + n + p.

First, let me jot down the given edge lengths:

- AB = CD = √41
- AC = BD = √80
- BC = AD = √89

Hmm, interesting. It seems like the opposite edges are equal. So AB = CD, AC = BD, BC = AD. That probably means the tetrahedron is "isohedral" or something like that, but I'm not sure. Maybe it's a kind of symmetrical tetrahedron.

I remember that in a tetrahedron, the inradius can be found using the formula:

r = 3V / S

where V is the volume of the tetrahedron, and S is the total surface area. So I need to find both the volume and the surface area.

But wait, how do I find the volume of a tetrahedron when all edges are given? I think I can use coordinates. Maybe assign coordinates to the points A, B, C, D such that the distances correspond to the given edges.

Alternatively, I could use the Cayley-Menger determinant, which gives the volume of a tetrahedron based on its edge lengths. That might be a good approach since I have all the edges.

Let me recall the formula for the Cayley-Menger determinant. The volume V is given by:

V = √[ CM / 288 ]

where CM is the determinant of the Cayley-Menger matrix, which is a 5x5 matrix. The matrix is constructed as follows:

The Cayley-Menger matrix for points A, B, C, D is:

| 0   1    1    1    1  |
| 1   0   AB² AC² AD² |
| 1  AB²  0   BC² BD² |
| 1  AC² BC²  0   CD² |
| 1  AD² BD² CD²  0  |

So, let's plug in the given edge lengths.

Given:
AB = √41, so AB² = 41
AC = √80, so AC² = 80
AD = √89, so AD² = 89
BC = √89, so BC² = 89
BD = √80, so BD² = 80
CD = √41, so CD² = 41

So, the Cayley-Menger matrix is:

Row 0: 0, 1, 1, 1, 1
Row 1: 1, 0, 41, 80, 89
Row 2: 1, 41, 0, 89, 80
Row 3: 1, 80, 89, 0, 41
Row 4: 1, 89, 80, 41, 0

Now, I need to compute the determinant of this 5x5 matrix. That sounds a bit daunting, but maybe there's some symmetry I can exploit.

Let me write the matrix more clearly:

0  1    1    1    1
1  0   41   80   89
1 41    0   89   80
1 80   89    0   41
1 89   80   41    0

Hmm, let me see if I can find a pattern. Rows 1, 2, 3, 4 seem to have a sort of symmetry. For example, row 1: 1, 0, 41, 80, 89
Row 2: 1, 41, 0, 89, 80
Row 3: 1, 80, 89, 0, 41
Row 4: 1, 89, 80, 41, 0

It seems like each row is a permutation of the entries in row 1. Maybe this symmetry can help simplify the determinant calculation.

Alternatively, maybe I can use properties of determinants to simplify this. For instance, if rows or columns are permutations of each other, perhaps the determinant can be factored or something like that.

But I'm not sure. Maybe I should try to compute the determinant step by step.

The Cayley-Menger determinant is:

CM = determinant of the above matrix.

Let me denote this matrix as M. So,

M = [
[0, 1, 1, 1, 1],
[1, 0, 41, 80, 89],
[1, 41, 0, 89, 80],
[1, 80, 89, 0, 41],
[1, 89, 80, 41, 0]
]

Computing a 5x5 determinant manually is tedious, but perhaps I can perform row or column operations to simplify it.

Alternatively, maybe I can expand the determinant using the first row.

The determinant is calculated as:

CM = 0 * det(minor) - 1 * det(minor) + 1 * det(minor) - 1 * det(minor) + 1 * det(minor)

But since the first element is 0, the first term is 0. So,

CM = -1 * det(M1) + 1 * det(M2) - 1 * det(M3) + 1 * det(M4)

Where M1, M2, M3, M4 are minors corresponding to the elements in the first row (excluding the first element, which was 0).

But this approach might not be the easiest. Maybe I should use some other method.

Wait, perhaps there's a formula for the volume of a tetrahedron with opposite edges equal. Since AB=CD, AC=BD, BC=AD, as given.

I recall that such a tetrahedron is called a "equifacial" tetrahedron if all faces are congruent, but I'm not sure if that's the case here.

Alternatively, maybe I can assign coordinates to the points to make the calculations manageable.

Let's try that approach. Let me place point A at (0, 0, 0). Let me assign coordinates to other points such that the given edge lengths are satisfied.

Let’s denote the coordinates as follows:
- A = (0, 0, 0)
- B = (x, y, z)
- C = (p, q, r)
- D = (s, t, u)

But that might get too complicated with too many variables. Maybe I can make some smart choices to reduce variables.

Since the tetrahedron has opposite edges equal, perhaps it's symmetric with respect to some plane or line. Maybe it's a disphenoid, which is a tetrahedron where opposite edges are equal and each pair of opposite edges are equal in length.

Yes, a disphenoid. So, this tetrahedron is a disphenoid. In a disphenoid, all four faces are congruent triangles. Wait, no, not necessarily all four, but in this case, let me check.

Given the edges:

AB = CD = √41

AC = BD = √80

AD = BC = √89

So, each pair of opposite edges are equal. So, yes, it is a disphenoid. And in a disphenoid, all four faces are congruent.

Wait, but in this case, the faces might not be congruent because the edges are of different lengths.

Wait, no, each face is a triangle with edges of two different lengths.

Wait, for example, face ABC has edges AB = √41, BC = √89, and AC = √80. Similarly, face ABD has edges AB = √41, BD = √80, and AD = √89. So, all four faces are congruent triangles because each face has sides √41, √80, √89.

So, each face is congruent, so the tetrahedron is isohedral, meaning it's face-transitive.

That's useful because it might imply that the inradius can be found more straightforwardly.

But perhaps I should still proceed with coordinates.

Let me try to assign coordinates such that the centroid is at the origin or something, but maybe it's easier to place A at (0,0,0), B at (a,0,0), C at (0,b,0), and D at (0,0,c). But wait, would that satisfy the edge lengths? Let me check.

Wait, in this coordinate system, AB would be length a, AC would be length b, AD would be length c. Then, BC would be the distance between (a,0,0) and (0,b,0), which is √(a² + b²). Similarly, BD would be √(a² + c²), and CD would be √(b² + c²).

But in our case, AB = √41, so a = √41.

AC = √80, so b = √80.

AD = √89, so c = √89.

Then, BC would be √(a² + b²) = √(41 + 80) = √121 = 11. But wait, in the given problem, BC is √89. Hmm, that's a problem.

So, this coordinate system doesn't work because BC in this setup comes out as 11, but it's supposed to be √89.

So, perhaps this coordinate assignment is not suitable.

Alternatively, maybe I can place the points such that the centroid is at the origin, but that might complicate things.

Alternatively, since the tetrahedron is a disphenoid, it has a symmetric structure. I remember that in a disphenoid, the coordinates can be expressed in terms of two orthonormal vectors.

Wait, maybe I can use vectors. Let me think. In a disphenoid, the midpoints of the edges are all equidistant from the centroid.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use the fact that in a disphenoid, the volume can be calculated using the formula:

V = (4/3) * sqrt(det(G))

where G is a Gram matrix, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe I can use the formula for the volume of a disphenoid. I recall that for a disphenoid with edges a, b, c, the volume is:

V = (sqrt((a² + b² - c²)(a² - b² + c²)(-a² + b² + c²)))/72

Wait, but I'm not sure if that formula applies here. Maybe I need to verify.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to go back to the Cayley-Menger determinant. Let's try to compute that.

So, the matrix is:

Row 0: 0, 1, 1, 1, 1

Row 1: 1, 0, 41, 80, 89

Row 2: 1, 41, 0, 89, 80

Row 3: 1, 80, 89, 0, 41

Row 4: 1, 89, 80, 41, 0

Computing the determinant of this 5x5 matrix. Maybe I can use the fact that the matrix has a lot of symmetry, so perhaps the determinant can be simplified.

Alternatively, maybe I can perform row and column operations to make it upper triangular or something.

Let me note the structure of the matrix. The first row is [0,1,1,1,1], and the first column is [0,1,1,1,1]^T.

The other entries are symmetric in a way. For example, the (1,2) entry is 41, (2,1) is 41. Similarly, (1,3)=80, (3,1)=80, etc. So, it's a symmetric matrix except for the first row and column.

Wait, no, the entire matrix is symmetric because the distances are symmetric. So, M is a symmetric matrix.

Given that, perhaps I can use properties of symmetric matrices. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe I can compute the determinant step by step using expansion by minors.

But that's going to take a lot of steps.

Alternatively, maybe I can write this matrix as a sum of a diagonal matrix and a rank-1 matrix. Let's see.

The first row and column have 0 and 1s, so the matrix can be written as:

M = [0, 1, 1, 1, 1;
     1, 0, 41, 80, 89;
     1,41,0,89,80;
     1,80,89,0,41;
     1,89,80,41,0]

Let me denote the vector of ones as e = [0,1,1,1,1]^T. Then, the matrix can be written as:

M = e * [1 1 1 1 1]^T + [the rest of the matrix]

Wait, no, because the first row and column have 0 and 1s, but the rest of the matrix is symmetric.

Wait, perhaps M = e * [1 1 1 1 1]^T + N, where N is the matrix with N[0,0] = 0, N[1,1]=0, N[1,2]=41, N[1,3]=80, etc. So, N is a matrix with the same structure as M but subtracting the rank-1 matrix.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use the Sherman-Morrison formula or matrix determinant lemma, which relates the determinant of a matrix plus a rank-one matrix to the determinant of the original matrix and some other terms.

The matrix determinant lemma says that det(A + uv^T) = det(A) (1 + v^T A^{-1} u)

But in our case, M is a symmetric matrix, and perhaps I can express it as a rank-one update to a diagonal matrix.

Wait, let me think. Let me denote D as the diagonal matrix with D[1,1] = 0, D[2,2]=0, D[3,3]=0, D[4,4]=0, D[5,5]=0. That's a zero matrix, which is not helpful.

Alternatively, perhaps I can take a different approach.

Alternatively, maybe I can use the fact that in a disphenoid, the volume can be expressed in terms of the edges.

Wait, I found a formula for the volume of a disphenoid. The volume is given by:

V = (sqrt( (a² + b² - c²)(a² - b² + c²)(-a² + b² + c²) )) / 72

But I'm not sure if this is correct. Let me check.

Wait, for a tetrahedron, the volume can be found using Heron's formula if it's a disphenoid. But I'm not sure if that's applicable here.

Wait, another approach: for a disphenoid, all four faces are congruent triangles. So, each face has sides a, b, c, where a, b, c are √41, √80, √89.

So, the area of each face can be calculated using Heron's formula, which would be the same for all four faces.

Wait, so maybe I can compute the area of one face, then multiply by four to get the total surface area, then find the volume, and then use that to find the inradius.

Wait, but Heron's formula requires knowing all three sides. Let me compute the area of face ABC.

Sides: AB = √41, BC = √89, AC = √80.

Compute semi-perimeter, s = (√41 + √89 + √80)/2

But that's going to be messy. Alternatively, use the formula for area in terms of vectors, but perhaps it's not helpful.

Alternatively, I can compute the area with the formula:

Area = (1/4) * sqrt( (a + b + c)(-a + b + c)(a - b + c)(a + b - c) )

So, plugging in the values:

a = √41, b = √89, c = √80

Compute each term:

a + b + c = √41 + √89 + √80

That's a big expression. Let me compute numerically to check if it's positive.

√41 ≈ 6.403
√80 ≈ 8.944
√89 ≈ 9.434

So, sum ≈ 6.403 + 8.944 + 9.434 ≈ 24.781

Now, (-a + b + c) = (-6.403 + 8.944 + 9.434) ≈ 12.0

(a - b + c) = (6.403 - 8.944 + 9.434) ≈ 6.893

(a + b - c) = (6.403 + 8.944 - 9.434) ≈ 6.013

Now, compute the product:

24.781 * 12.0 * 6.893 * 6.013

Hmm, that's a lot, but let's compute step by step.

First, 24.781 * 12.0 = 297.372

Then, 6.893 * 6.013 ≈ 41.463

Then, 297.372 * 41.463 ≈ 12,300 (approx)

So, the square root of that would be sqrt(12,300) ≈ 110.9

Then, Area = (1/4) * 110.9 ≈ 27.725

But that's an approximate value. Maybe I can compute it exactly.

Wait, let's compute the exact value.

Compute the product:

(a + b + c)(-a + b + c)(a - b + c)(a + b - c)

= ( (√41 + √89 + √80) ) * ( (-√41 + √89 + √80) ) * ( (√41 - √89 + √80) ) * ( (√41 + √89 - √80) )

Hmm, this seems complicated, but perhaps we can simplify it.

Let me denote x = √41, y = √89, z = √80.

So, the product is (x + y + z)(-x + y + z)(x - y + z)(x + y - z)

I recall that this is equal to 2(x² y² + y² z² + z² x²) - (x^4 + y^4 + z^4)

Wait, is that correct?

Wait, actually, the product (a + b + c)(-a + b + c)(a - b + c)(a + b - c) is known as 16 times the square of the area of the triangle. Wait, no, wait, Heron's formula says that 16 Area² = (a + b + c)(-a + b + c)(a - b + c)(a + b - c). So, in our case, 16 A² = that product.

So, we can compute the exact value.

Let me compute:

Term1 = (x + y + z)
Term2 = (-x + y + z)
Term3 = (x - y + z)
Term4 = (x + y - z)

Compute Term1 * Term2 = [ (y + z) + x ] [ (y + z) - x ] = (y + z)^2 - x²

Similarly, Term3 * Term4 = [x + (z - y)] [x - (z - y)] = x² - (z - y)^2

So, overall product becomes:

[ (y + z)^2 - x² ] * [ x² - (z - y)^2 ]

Let me compute each part.

First, (y + z)^2 - x² = y² + 2 y z + z² - x²

Similarly, x² - (z - y)^2 = x² - (z² - 2 y z + y²) = x² - z² + 2 y z - y²

Now, multiply these two:

(y² + 2 y z + z² - x²) * (x² - z² + 2 y z - y²)

Let me denote A = y² + z² - x², B = 2 y z

So, first term is (A + B), second term is (x² - (y² + z² - A) + B )

Wait, maybe that's not helpful.

Alternatively, let me denote:

Let me compute it as:

= (y² + 2 y z + z² - x²) * (x² - y² - z² + 2 y z )

= [ (y² + z² - x²) + 2 y z ] * [ (x² - y² - z²) + 2 y z ]

Let me let C = y² + z² - x², D = x² - y² - z²

So, the expression becomes (C + 2 y z)(-C + 2 y z) = (2 y z)^2 - C^2

So, that's 4 y² z² - (y² + z² - x²)^2

Now, compute that:

= 4 y² z² - (y² + z² - x²)^2

Expand the square:

= 4 y² z² - [ y^4 + z^4 + x^4 + 2 y² z² - 2 y² x² - 2 z² x² ]

= 4 y² z² - y^4 - z^4 - x^4 - 2 y² z² + 2 y² x² + 2 z² x²

Simplify:

= (4 y² z² - 2 y² z²) - y^4 - z^4 - x^4 + 2 y² x² + 2 z² x²

= 2 y² z² - y^4 - z^4 - x^4 + 2 y² x² + 2 z² x²

= - y^4 - z^4 - x^4 + 2 y² z² + 2 y² x² + 2 z² x²

Wait, this looks like - (x^4 + y^4 + z^4) + 2(x² y² + y² z² + z² x²)

So, the product is 2(x² y² + y² z² + z² x²) - (x^4 + y^4 + z^4)

So, 16 A² = 2(x² y² + y² z² + z² x²) - (x^4 + y^4 + z^4)

So, compute that:

Given x² = 41, y² = 89, z² =80.

Compute x² y² = 41 * 89 = let's compute that:

41 * 90 = 3690, subtract 41: 3690 -41= 3649.

Similarly, y² z² = 89 *80=7120.

z² x²=80 *41=3280.

So, sum is 3649 +7120 +3280 = let's compute:

3649 +7120 = 10769; 10769 +3280=14049.

So, 2*(sum) = 2*14049=28098.

Now, compute x^4 + y^4 + z^4.

x^4 = (41)^2=1681

y^4 = (89)^2=7921

z^4 = (80)^2=6400

Sum: 1681 +7921=9602; 9602 +6400=16002

So, 16 A²= 28098 -16002=12096

Thus, A²=12096 /16=756

So, A=√756.

Simplify √756:

756=4*189=4*9*21=4*9*3*7=2² *3² *3*7

So, √756=2*3*√(3*7)=6√21

Thus, Area A=6√21

Therefore, the area of each face is 6√21, and since there are four faces, the total surface area S=4*6√21=24√21.

Okay, so S=24√21.

Now, I need to find the volume V.

Using the Cayley-Menger determinant. Let me go back to that.

Earlier, I had the Cayley-Menger determinant matrix:

Row 0: 0,1,1,1,1

Row 1:1,0,41,80,89

Row 2:1,41,0,89,80

Row 3:1,80,89,0,41

Row 4:1,89,80,41,0

I need to compute the determinant of this matrix.

Wait, maybe I can compute it numerically.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use the fact that in a disphenoid, the volume can be expressed in terms of the edge lengths.

Wait, from the formula I found earlier, the volume V is sqrt( (a² + b² - c²)(a² - b² + c²)(-a² + b² + c²) ) / 72.

Wait, but in this case, the edges are different. Wait, perhaps I need to assign a, b, c correctly.

Wait, in a disphenoid, the edge lengths can be considered as three pairs of equal lengths, which we have.

So, perhaps for the formula, a, b, c are the lengths of the three unequal edges. So, in this case, a=√41, b=√80, c=√89.

So, plugging into the formula:

V = sqrt( (a² + b² - c²)(a² - b² + c²)(-a² + b² + c²) ) / 72

Compute each term:

a² =41, b²=80, c²=89

(a² + b² - c²) =41 +80 -89= 32

(a² - b² + c²)=41 -80 +89=50

(-a² + b² + c²)= -41 +80 +89=128

So, the product is 32 *50 *128= 32*50=1600; 1600*128=204,800

So, sqrt(204800)=sqrt(2048 *100)=10*sqrt(2048)

Simplify sqrt(2048):

2048=1024*2=32² *2, so sqrt(2048)=32*sqrt(2)

So, sqrt(204800)=10*32*sqrt(2)=320√2

Thus, V=320√2 /72= (320/72)√2= (40/9)√2

Simplify 40/9: 40 and 9 are coprime.

So, V= (40√2)/9

Wait, does that make sense? Let me check the calculation.

Wait, product:32 *50 *128.

32*50=1600, 1600*128=204,800.

sqrt(204,800)=sqrt(2048*100)=sqrt(2048)*10.

2048=2^11, so sqrt(2048)=2^(11/2)=2^5 *sqrt(2)=32√2.

So, sqrt(2048)*10=32√2*10=320√2.

Then, volume is 320√2 /72= (320/72)√2= 40/9 √2.

Yes, that seems correct.

So, V=40√2 /9.

Now, I can compute the inradius r=3V/S.

We have S=24√21, V=40√2 /9.

So,

r= 3*(40√2 /9) / (24√21)

Simplify numerator:

3*(40√2 /9)= (120√2)/9= (40√2)/3

Denominator is 24√21.

So,

r= (40√2 /3) / (24√21) = (40√2)/(3*24√21) = (40√2)/(72√21)

Simplify fractions:

40 and 72 have a common factor of 8: 40/8=5, 72/8=9.

So, 5√2/(9√21)

Multiply numerator and denominator by √21 to rationalize:

=5√2 *√21 / (9*21)=5√42 / (189)

Simplify:

√42 can't be simplified further, and 5 and 189 are coprime (since 189=9*21=9*3*7, 5 is prime and doesn't divide 189).

So, r=5√42 /189.

Wait, that seems small. Let me check the calculations.

Wait, inradius r=3V/S.

V=40√2 /9

3V= (120√2)/9= (40√2)/3

S=24√21

So, r= (40√2 /3) / (24√21)= (40√2)/(3*24√21)= 40/(72) * √2/√21= 5/9 * (√2/√21)=5√2/(9√21)

Rationalizing the denominator:

Multiply numerator and denominator by √21:

5√2 *√21 / (9*21)=5√42 / 189.

Yes, that's correct.

So, r=5√42 /189.

But the problem states that the distance can be written as m√n /p, where m and p are coprime, and n is square-free.

Check if 5 and 189 are coprime. 189=3^3 *7, 5 is prime, so yes, they are coprime.

Check n=42: 42 factors into 2*3*7, which are all primes, so 42 is square-free.

Thus, m=5, n=42, p=189.

Therefore, m +n +p=5+42+189=236.

Wait, but that seems a bit high. Let me double-check all steps in case of any miscalculations.

Wait, when I computed the Cayley-Menger determinant, I used the formula:

V = sqrt( |CM| /288 )

But earlier, when I used the disphenoid volume formula, I got V=40√2 /9.

But let me confirm if that formula is correct.

The formula I used for the volume was:

V= sqrt( (a² + b² - c²)(a² - b² + c²)(-a² + b² + c²) ) /72

But actually, upon checking, I think that the correct formula for the volume of a disphenoid is:

V = sqrt( (a² + b² - c²)(a² - b² + c²)(-a² + b² + c²) ) / (72)

Which is what I used. So, that should be correct.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in computing the surface area.

Wait, each face has area 6√21, so four faces make 24√21.

Yes, that seems correct.

So, r=3V/S = 3*(40√2/9)/(24√21)= (40√2/3)/(24√21)= 40√2/(3*24√21)=5√2/(9√21)=5√42/(9*21)=5√42/189.

Yes, that seems correct.

So, the answer is 5√42 /189, so m=5, n=42, p=189. Sum is 5+42+189=236.

Wait, but in the problem statement, it says the inradius is the distance from I to each face. So, yes, that's correct.

Therefore, the final answer is 236.

The given tetrahedron \(ABCD\) has opposite edges equal: \(AB = CD = \sqrt{41}\), \(AC = BD = \sqrt{80}\), and \(BC = AD = \sqrt{89}\). This makes it a disphenoid, a tetrahedron where all faces are congruent triangles.

To find the inradius \(r\), we use the formula \(r = \frac{3V}{S}\), where \(V\) is the volume and \(S\) is the total surface area.

1. **Surface Area Calculation**:
   Each face is a triangle with sides \(\sqrt{41}\), \(\sqrt{80}\), and \(\sqrt{89}\). Using Heron's formula, the area of one face is calculated to be \(6\sqrt{21}\). Since there are four congruent faces, the total surface area \(S = 4 \times 6\sqrt{21} = 24\sqrt{21}\).

2. **Volume Calculation**:
   Using the formula for the volume of a disphenoid:
   \[
   V = \frac{\sqrt{(a^2 + b^2 - c^2)(a^2 - b^2 + c^2)(-a^2 + b^2 + c^2)}}{72}
   \]
   where \(a = \sqrt{41}\), \(b = \sqrt{80}\), and \(c = \sqrt{89}\). Substituting the values:
   \[
   V = \frac{\sqrt{(41 + 80 - 89)(41 - 80 + 89)(-41 + 80 + 89)}}{72} = \frac{\sqrt{32 \times 50 \times 128}}{72} = \frac{40\sqrt{2}}{9}
   \]

3. **Inradius Calculation**:
   Substituting \(V\) and \(S\) into the formula for \(r\):
   \[
   r = \frac{3V}{S} = \frac{3 \times \frac{40\sqrt{2}}{9}}{24\sqrt{21}} = \frac{40\sqrt{2}}{72\sqrt{21}} = \frac{5\sqrt{42}}{189}
   \]
   Simplifying, the inradius is \(\frac{5\sqrt{42}}{189}\).

The values are \(m = 5\), \(n = 42\), and \(p = 189\). Thus, \(m + n + p = 5 + 42 + 189 = 236\).

\boxed{236}
