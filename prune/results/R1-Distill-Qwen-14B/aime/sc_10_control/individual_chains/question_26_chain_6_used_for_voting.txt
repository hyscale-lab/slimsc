Okay, so I have this geometry problem here. Let me try to visualize it first. There's a triangle ABC inscribed in a circle ω. The tangents at B and C meet at point D, and then line AD intersects the circle again at point P. We're given the lengths AB=5, BC=9, and AC=10. We need to find AP expressed as a fraction m/n, where m and n are coprime, and then find m + n.

Hmm, okay. So, first, I should probably draw a diagram. But since I don't have paper right now, I'll try to imagine it. Triangle ABC with sides AB=5, BC=9, AC=10. So, it's a scalene triangle. The circle ω is the circumcircle of ABC. Then, the tangents at B and C meet at D. Tangents from a common external point to a circle are equal in length, so BD = CD.

Then, line AD intersects ω again at P. So, P is the second intersection point of AD with the circumcircle. We need to find the length AP.

I remember that when dealing with points where lines intersect circles, power of a point might come in handy. The power of point D with respect to ω should be equal to DB² = DC² because D is the point where the tangents meet. Also, since AD intersects the circle at A and P, the power of point D with respect to ω can also be expressed as DP * DA.

Wait, let me write that down:

Power of D with respect to ω is DB² = DC² = DP * DA.

So, if I can find DB, which is equal to DC, then I can set up an equation involving DP and DA.

But I don't know DB yet. Hmm. Maybe I can find DB in terms of the sides of the triangle.

Alternatively, maybe I can find coordinates for all these points. Coordinate geometry might be a way, but that might get messy. Alternatively, maybe using similar triangles or other circle theorems.

Wait, let me think about the properties. Since BD and CD are tangents, angles between tangent and chord are equal to the angles in the alternate segment. So, angle between BD and BC is equal to angle BAC, and similarly, angle between CD and CB is equal to angle BAC as well.

Wait, no, actually, the angle between tangent and chord is equal to the angle in the alternate segment. So, angle between tangent BD and chord BC is equal to angle BAC, and similarly, angle between tangent CD and chord CB is equal to angle BAC as well. So, both angles at D are equal to angle BAC.

Wait, no. Let me correct that. The angle between tangent at B and chord BC is equal to the angle that BC makes with the arc in the alternate segment. So, it's equal to angle BAC. Similarly, the angle between tangent at C and chord CB is equal to angle CAB as well.

So, in triangle DBC, angles at B and C are both equal to angle BAC. Wait, no. Let me clarify: the angle between tangent BD and BC is equal to angle BAC. Similarly, the angle between tangent CD and CB is equal to angle BAC. So, angle DBC = angle BAC, and angle DCB = angle BAC. So, triangle DBC has two angles equal to angle BAC. Therefore, triangle DBC is similar to triangle ABC? Wait, not necessarily, because the sides might not be proportional.

Wait, maybe not similar. Alternatively, perhaps triangle DBC is isosceles with DB=DC, which we already know.

So, let's denote angle BAC as α. Then, angle DBC = angle DCB = α. Therefore, triangle DBC is isosceles with DB=DC, and base angles equal to α.

So, in triangle DBC, the apex angle at D is equal to 180° - 2α.

Hmm, maybe I can find angle BAC first. Since I know the sides of triangle ABC, I can use the Law of Cosines to find angle BAC.

Yes, that's a good idea. Let's compute angle BAC first.

Given triangle ABC with sides AB=5, BC=9, AC=10.

Using Law of Cosines:

cos(angle BAC) = (AB² + AC² - BC²) / (2 * AB * AC)

Plugging in the values:

cos(α) = (5² + 10² - 9²) / (2 * 5 * 10) = (25 + 100 - 81) / 100 = (44) / 100 = 0.44

So, α = arccos(0.44). I don't need the exact angle, but maybe I can find sin(α) for later use.

sin(α) = sqrt(1 - (0.44)^2) = sqrt(1 - 0.1936) = sqrt(0.8064) ≈ 0.898. But let's keep it exact: sin(α) = sqrt( (1 - (11/25)) ) = sqrt(14/25) = sqrt(14)/5 ≈ 0.898.

Wait, wait. Let me compute 0.44 squared: 0.44*0.44 is 0.1936. So, 1 - 0.1936 is 0.8064. So, sqrt(0.8064) is sqrt(8064/10000) = sqrt(8064)/100. Let me see if 8064 can be simplified.

8064 divided by 16 is 504. 504 divided by 16 is 31.5, no. Let's factor 8064:

8064 = 64 * 126 = 64 * 9 * 14 = 64 * 9 * 2 * 7.

So sqrt(8064) = 8 * 3 * sqrt(2*7) = 24 * sqrt(14). So, sqrt(8064)/100 = (24 sqrt(14))/100 = (6 sqrt(14))/25. So, sin(α) = 6√14 / 25.

Okay, so sin(α) = 6√14 /25.

Now, going back to triangle DBC. We know that angles at B and C are both equal to α. So, angle at D is 180° - 2α.

So, in triangle DBC, sides DB = DC (tangents from D), BC is 9, and angles at B and C are α.

Wait, perhaps using the Law of Sines on triangle DBC.

Law of Sines: DB / sin(angle DCB) = BC / sin(angle D)

So, DB / sin(α) = 9 / sin(180 - 2α)

But sin(180 - 2α) = sin(2α) = 2 sin α cos α.

So, substituting:

DB / sin α = 9 / (2 sin α cos α)

Multiply both sides by sin α:

DB = 9 / (2 cos α)

We have cos α = 0.44 = 11/25. So,

DB = 9 / (2 * (11/25)) ) = 9 / (22/25) = 9 * (25/22) = 225/22.

So, DB = 225/22. Since DB = DC, both are 225/22.

So, now, the power of point D with respect to ω is DB² = (225/22)^2.

But power of D is also equal to DP * DA. Since DA is the line from D through A to P.

So, DA = DP + PA. But we can write DA = DP + AP, but actually, since AD passes through P, it's DA = DP + PA? Wait, no. Point P is on AD, so AP is part of DA beyond A. Wait, actually, D is outside the circle, and AD passes through A and then P. So, DA is the segment from D to A, and DP is from D to P. So, DA = DP - AP? Wait, no. Wait, A is between D and P. So, DA is the length from D to A, and DP is the length from D to P, so DA = DP - AP. Therefore, DP = DA + AP.

Wait, let me clarify. If I have points D, A, P in that order along the line AD, then DA is the distance from D to A, and DP is the distance from D to P. So, since A is between D and P, DP = DA + AP.

Therefore, the power of point D is DP * DA = (DA + AP) * DA.

Wait, no, power of a point D with respect to ω is equal to DB² = DC² = DP * DA', where DA' is the length from D to the other intersection point. Wait, actually, the power of D is equal to DB² = DP * DQ, where DQ is the entire secant. Wait, no, the formula is power = (distance from D to center)^2 - radius^2, but in this case, it's equal to DB² because DB is the tangent.

But also, for a secant DP intersecting the circle at A and P, the power is DP * DQ, where Q is the other intersection point. Wait, no, the power is DA * DP, because DA is from D to A, and DP is from D to P. Wait, no, the power formula is DA * DP, where DA is the entire secant and DP is the external part. No, wait, maybe it's DA * DP? Or is it DA * (DA + AP)?

Wait, let's get this straight. The power of a point D with respect to circle ω is equal to the square of the tangent length from D to ω, which is DB². It's also equal to the product of the lengths from D to the two intersection points of any secant line through D. So, in this case, the secant is DP, which intersects ω at A and P. So, the power is DA * DP.

Wait, but in the standard formula, it's DA * DP, where DA is the length from D to A, and DP is the length from D to P. Wait, but if A is between D and P, then DA is the shorter segment, and DP is the longer. So, DA * DP would be DA * (DA + AP). Hmm, but I think the formula is DA * DP, where DA is the entire length from D to A, and DP is DA + AP.

Wait, no, I think the correct formula is that if a secant from D passes through the circle at A and P, then the power is DA * DP, with DA being the distance from D to A, and DP being the distance from D to P, so DA * DP is equal to DB².

Wait, let me check the formula. The power of a point D outside the circle is equal to DB² = DA * DP, where DA is the distance from D to A, and DP is the distance from D to P. But since A is on the circle and P is another point on the circle, DA is the length from D to A, and DP is the length from D to P. So, if DA is the shorter segment and DP is longer, then DA * DP is equal to DB².

Wait, no. Actually, the correct formula is that the power is equal to DA * (DA + AP), because DP = DA + AP, since A is between D and P. So, it's DA * DP = DB².

Wait, no, more accurately, the power is DA * DP, where DA is the length from D to the first intersection point (A), and DP is the length from D to the second intersection point (P). But in reality, if the line passes through the circle, the power is equal to DA * DP, where DA is the distance from D to A, and DP is the distance from D to P. So, if A is closer to D than P, then DA < DP, and the power is DA * DP.

But in this case, since D is outside the circle, and A is on the circle, and P is another point on the circle, then DA is the distance from D to A, and DP is the distance from D to P. So, the power of D is DA * DP = DB².

But wait, that would mean DB² = DA * DP.

But we can write DP = DA + AP. So, DB² = DA * (DA + AP). Hmm, but we don't know DA.

Wait, but maybe we can find DA in terms of other lengths.

Alternatively, maybe using Menelaus' theorem or something else.

Wait, perhaps coordinate geometry is the way to go. Let me try that.

Let me place point C at the origin (0,0), point A at (10, 0), and point B somewhere in the plane. Then, I can calculate coordinates for B.

Given AB=5, BC=9, and AC=10.

So, coordinates:

C: (0,0)
A: (10,0)
B: (x,y), which we need to find.

Distance from A to B is 5: sqrt( (x-10)^2 + y^2 ) = 5 → (x-10)^2 + y^2 =25.

Distance from B to C is 9: sqrt(x^2 + y^2 )=9 → x^2 + y^2=81.

So, subtracting the two equations:

(x-10)^2 + y^2 - (x^2 + y^2) = 25 - 81 → x² -20x +100 + y² - x² - y² = -56 → -20x +100 = -56 → -20x = -156 → x = 156/20 = 39/5 = 7.8.

So, x=7.8, which is 39/5.

Now, plug x=39/5 into x² + y²=81:

(39/5)^2 + y^2 =81 → (1521/25) + y^2 =81 → y²=81 - 1521/25 = (2025/25 - 1521/25)=504/25.

So, y= sqrt(504/25)=sqrt(504)/5. Simplify sqrt(504):

504=16*31.5, but 504=16*31.5 is not helpful. Let me factor 504:

504= 16*31.5? No, 504 divided by 16 is 31.5? Wait, 16*31=496, 16*31.5=504. So, 504= (16)*(63/2). Alternatively, 504= 72*7= 8*9*7= 8*63.

So, sqrt(504)=sqrt(8*63)=sqrt(8)*sqrt(63)= 2√2 * 3√7=6√14.

Wait, wait, let me compute sqrt(504):

504= 16*31.5 → no, 16*31=496, 16*31.5=504, but 31.5=63/2. So, 504=16*(63/2)=8*63. So, sqrt(504)=sqrt(8*63)=sqrt(8)*sqrt(63)= 2√2 * 3√7=6√14. So, sqrt(504)=6√14.

Therefore, y=6√14 /5.

So, point B is at (39/5, 6√14/5).

So, coordinates:

A: (10,0)
B: (39/5, 6√14/5)
C: (0,0)

Now, we need to find point D, which is the intersection of the tangents at B and C.

Wait, the tangent at C is easy since C is at (0,0). The tangent at C to the circumcircle ω.

Wait, but what is the circumcircle ω? Let me find the equation of the circumcircle first.

We have three points A(10,0), B(39/5, 6√14/5), C(0,0). Let's find the circumcircle equation.

The general equation of a circle is x² + y² + 2gx + 2fy + c =0.

Since point C(0,0) is on the circle: 0 +0 +0 +0 +c=0 → c=0.

So, equation becomes x² + y² + 2gx + 2fy =0.

Now, plug point A(10,0):

10² + 0 + 2g*10 + 2f*0 =0 → 100 +20g=0 → 20g= -100 → g= -5.

Now, plug point B(39/5, 6√14/5):

(39/5)^2 + (6√14/5)^2 + 2*(-5)*(39/5) + 2f*(6√14/5) =0.

Compute each term:

(39/5)^2 = (1521)/25.

(6√14/5)^2= (36*14)/25=504/25.

2*(-5)*(39/5)= 2*(-5)*(39/5)= 2*(-39)= -78.

2f*(6√14/5)= (12√14 f)/5.

So, putting it all together:

1521/25 + 504/25 -78 + (12√14 f)/5 =0.

Combine the first two terms:

(1521 + 504)/25 = 2025/25=81.

So:

81 -78 + (12√14 f)/5 =0 → 3 + (12√14 f)/5=0 → (12√14 f)/5= -3 → f= (-3 *5)/(12√14)= (-15)/(12√14)= (-5)/(4√14).

Rationalizing the denominator:

f= (-5)/(4√14) * (√14/√14)= (-5√14)/(4*14)= (-5√14)/56.

So, f= -5√14 /56.

Therefore, the equation of the circumcircle ω is x² + y² + 2*(-5)x + 2*(-5√14/56)y =0 → x² + y² -10x - (5√14/28)y =0.

Alternatively, x² + y² -10x - (5√14/28)y =0.

So, now, we need the equations of the tangents at B and C.

First, tangent at C(0,0). The equation of the tangent to a circle at a point (x₁,y₁) is given by:

xx₁ + yy₁ + g(x + x₁) + f(y + y₁) + c =0.

But since c=0, it's xx₁ + yy₁ + g(x +x₁) + f(y + y₁)=0.

So, for point C(0,0):

x*0 + y*0 + g(x +0) + f(y +0)=0 → gx + fy=0.

So, tangent at C is: (-5)x + (-5√14/56)y=0 → -5x - (5√14/56)y=0.

Multiply both sides by 56 to eliminate denominators:

-280x -5√14 y=0 → 280x +5√14 y=0.

Wait, but since it's a tangent, it should pass through C(0,0), which it does.

Wait, but perhaps I should compute it another way. Another formula for tangent at point (x₁,y₁) is:

(x₁)x + (y₁)y + g(x + x₁) + f(y + y₁) + c =0.

But with c=0, and (x₁,y₁)=(0,0), it's 0 +0 + g x + f y=0 → gx + fy=0.

But in our case, g=-5, f=-5√14/56.

So, tangent at C is: (-5)x + (-5√14/56)y=0 → -5x - (5√14/56)y=0.

We can write this as 5x + (5√14/56)y=0, but that would be the same line in opposite direction. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in sign.

Wait, point C is (0,0), and the tangent line is given by T: xx₁ + yy₁ + g(x +x₁) + f(y + y₁) + c =0.

But, with (x₁,y₁)=(0,0), and c=0, it's just gx + fy=0. Since g=-5 and f=-5√14/56, the equation becomes:

-5x - (5√14/56)y=0.

We can factor out -5:

-5 [x + (√14/56)y ] =0 → x + (√14/56)y=0.

But this is the equation of the tangent at C.

Wait, that seems a bit messy. Maybe it's better to compute the slope.

Alternatively, the tangent at C is perpendicular to the radius OC, where O is the center of the circle.

Wait, the center of the circle is at (-g, -f) = (5, 5√14/56).

So, center O is at (5, 5√14/56).

Therefore, the radius OC is the vector from O to C, which is (0 -5, 0 -5√14/56) = (-5, -5√14/56).

The tangent at C is perpendicular to OC, so its slope is the negative reciprocal of the slope of OC.

Slope of OC: (Δy)/(Δx)= (-5√14/56)/(-5)= (√14/56)/1= √14/56.

So, slope of OC is √14/56. Therefore, the slope of the tangent at C is the negative reciprocal: -56/√14= -56√14/14= -4√14.

So, the tangent at C has a slope of -4√14 and passes through C(0,0). So, equation is y= -4√14 x.

Similarly, let's find the tangent at B.

Point B is (39/5, 6√14/5). The tangent at B is perpendicular to the radius OB.

Compute the slope of OB: from center O(5,5√14/56) to B(39/5,6√14/5).

Compute Δx= 39/5 -5= 39/5 -25/5=14/5.

Δy= 6√14/5 -5√14/56.

Compute 6√14/5 -5√14/56.

Find a common denominator, which is 280.

Convert 6√14/5: multiply numerator and denominator by 56: (6√14 *56)/280= 336√14 /280.

Convert 5√14/56: multiply numerator and denominator by 5: (5√14 *5)/280=25√14/280.

So, Δy= (336√14 -25√14)/280= (311√14)/280.

So, the slope of OB is Δy/Δx= (311√14/280) / (14/5)= (311√14/280) * (5/14)= (311√14 *5)/(280*14)= (1555√14)/(3920).

Simplify numerator and denominator: 1555 and 3920.

Divide numerator and denominator by 5: 311/784.

So, slope of OB is (311√14)/784.

Therefore, slope of tangent at B is the negative reciprocal: -784/(311√14).

Wait, that's a bit messy. Let me rationalize it:

Slope = -784/(311√14) = (-784√14)/(311*14)= (-784√14)/(4354)= (-784/4354)√14.

Simplify 784/4354: both divided by 2: 392/2177. 2177 is a prime? Let me check: 2177 divided by 7 is 311, yes, 7*311=2177. 392 is 49*8, so 392=49*8, 2177=7*311.

So, 392/2177= (49*8)/(7*311)= (7*7*8)/(7*311)= (7*8)/311=56/311.

So, slope= (-56√14)/311.

So, the equation of the tangent at B is:

y - y_B = m*(x -x_B).

So, y - (6√14/5) = (-56√14/311)(x - 39/5).

Now, that's the equation of the tangent at B.

We have the equations of the two tangents: tangent at C is y= -4√14 x, and tangent at B is y= (-56√14/311)(x -39/5) +6√14/5.

We need to find the intersection point D of these two tangents.

So, set y= -4√14 x into the equation of tangent at B.

So,

-4√14 x -6√14/5 = (-56√14/311)(x -39/5).

Simplify this equation.

First, let me write both sides:

Left side: -4√14 x -6√14/5

Right side: (-56√14/311)(x -39/5)

Let me factor out √14 on both sides:

√14 [ -4x -6/5 ] = √14 [ (-56/311)(x -39/5) ]

Divide both sides by √14:

-4x -6/5 = (-56/311)(x -39/5)

Now, multiply both sides by 311 to eliminate denominators:

311*(-4x -6/5) = -56(x -39/5)

Compute left side:

311*(-4x) + 311*(-6/5) = -1244x - (1866/5)

Right side:

-56x + (56*39)/5= -56x + 2184/5.

So, equation becomes:

-1244x -1866/5 = -56x +2184/5.

Bring all terms to left side:

-1244x +56x -1866/5 -2184/5=0 → (-1188x) - (4050)/5 =0 → -1188x -810=0.

So,

-1188x =810 → x=810/(-1188)= -810/1188.

Simplify this fraction.

Divide numerator and denominator by 9:

810 ÷9=90; 1188 ÷9=132.

So, x= -90/132= -15/22.

So, x= -15/22.

Now, find y using y= -4√14 x:

y= -4√14*(-15/22)= (60√14)/22= (30√14)/11.

So, point D is at (-15/22, 30√14/11).

So, now, we have point D at (-15/22,30√14/11) and point A at (10,0). We need to find the equation of line AD and find its intersection with the circumcircle ω again at point P.

First, find the parametric equation of line AD.

Parametric equations:

x = x_A + t(x_D -x_A) =10 + t*(-15/22 -10)=10 + t*(-235/22).

y= y_A + t(y_D - y_A)=0 + t*(30√14/11 -0)= t*(30√14/11).

We can write this as:

x=10 - (235/22)t

y=(30√14/11)t

We need to find t such that this point (x,y) lies on the circumcircle ω.

The equation of ω is x² + y² -10x - (5√14/56)y=0.

Substitute x and y:

[10 - (235/22)t]^2 + [ (30√14/11 t ) ]^2 -10[10 - (235/22)t ] - (5√14/56)(30√14/11 t )=0.

Let me compute each term step by step.

First term: [10 - (235/22)t]^2.

Let me compute this:

=100 - 2*10*(235/22)t + (235/22)^2 t²

=100 - (4700/22)t + (55225/484) t²

Simplify:

4700/22 = 2350/11 ≈213.636

But I'll keep it as fractions.

Second term: [ (30√14/11 t ) ]^2.

= (900 *14)/121 t²= 12600/121 t².

Third term: -10[10 - (235/22)t ]

= -100 + (2350/22)t.

Fourth term: -(5√14/56)(30√14/11 t )

= -(5*30)*(14)/(56*11) t

= -(150 *14)/(616) t

Simplify 150*14=2100; 616=56*11= (8*7)*11.

2100/616: divide numerator and denominator by 28: 75/22.

So, it's -(75/22) t.

Now, combine all terms:

First term: 100 - (4700/22)t + (55225/484)t²

Second term: +12600/121 t²

Third term: -100 + (2350/22)t

Fourth term: - (75/22)t

Now, combine like terms:

Constants: 100 -100=0.

t terms: (-4700/22 +2350/22 -75/22 ) t

= [ (-4700 +2350 -75)/22 ] t

= [ (-2425)/22 ] t.

t² terms: (55225/484 +12600/121 ) t².

Convert 12600/121 to denominator 484: multiply numerator and denominator by 4: 50400/484.

So, 55225 +50400=105625.

So, t² terms: 105625/484 t².

So, overall equation:

0 - (2425/22) t + (105625/484) t²=0.

Multiply through by 484 to eliminate denominators:

0 - (2425/22)*484 t +105625 t²=0.

Compute (2425/22)*484:

2425 * (484/22) =2425 *22= since 484/22=22.

2425 *22= (2400*22)+(25*22)=52800 +550=53350.

So, equation becomes:

-53350 t +105625 t²=0.

Factor t:

t(-53350 +105625 t)=0.

So, solutions t=0 and t=53350/105625.

Simplify 53350/105625.

Divide numerator and denominator by 25: 53350/25=2134, 105625/25=4225.

So, 2134/4225.

Check if they can be reduced further.

2134: let's see, 2134 divided by 2 is 1067, which is prime? 1067 divided by 11 is 97, yes, 11*97=1067. So, 2134=2*11*97.

4225: 4225=65^2= (5*13)^2=5²*13².

So, no common factors. So, t=2134/4225.

But t=0 corresponds to point A(10,0). The other solution is t=2134/4225, which corresponds to point P.

Wait, but 2134 and 4225: 2134 is 2*11*97, 4225 is 5²*13². No common factors. So, t=2134/4225.

Now, compute coordinates of P:

x=10 - (235/22)t=10 - (235/22)*(2134/4225).

Compute this:

First, compute (235/22)*(2134/4225).

Multiply numerators: 235*2134= let's compute 235*2000=470000, 235*134=235*(100+34)=23500 +800 + (235*4)=23500 +800 +940=25240. So, total 470000 +25240=495240.

Wait, no, 235*2134=235*(2000+134)=235*2000 +235*134=470000 +235*134.

Compute 235*134:

235*100=23500,

235*34=235*(30+4)=7050 +940=7990.

So, 235*134=23500+7990=31490.

So, 235*2134=470000 +31490=501,490.

Wait, no: 470,000 +31,490=501,490? Wait, 470,000 +31,490=501,490? No, 470,000 +31,000=501,000, plus 490 is 501,490. Yes.

Denominator:22*4225= 22*(4200 +25)=22*4200=92,400 +22*25=550 → 92,400 +550=92,950.

So, (235/22)*(2134/4225)=501,490 /92,950.

Simplify this fraction.

Divide numerator and denominator by 10: 50,149 /9,295.

Check if 50,149 and 9,295 have common factors.

Compute GCD(50149,9295).

Compute 50149 ÷9295: 5 times 9295=46,475. Subtract from 50,149: 50,149 -46,475=3,674.

Now, find GCD(9295,3674).

9295 ÷3674=2 times, 2*3674=7348. Subtract:9295-7348=1947.

GCD(3674,1947).

3674 ÷1947=1 time, remainder 3674-1947=1727.

GCD(1947,1727).

1947-1727=220.

GCD(1727,220).

1727 ÷220=7 times, 7*220=1540. Subtract:1727-1540=187.

GCD(220,187).

220-187=33.

GCD(187,33).

187 ÷33=5 times, 5*33=165. Subtract:187-165=22.

GCD(33,22).

33-22=11.

GCD(22,11)=11.

So, GCD is 11.

So, 50,149 ÷11=4559 (since 11*4559=50,149).

9,295 ÷11=845 (11*845=9,295).

So, 50,149/9,295=4559/845.

Check if 4559 and 845 have common factors.

845=5*13^2.

4559 ÷13= 350.69… not integer. 4559 ÷5=911.8, not integer.

So, 4559/845 is reduced.

So, (235/22)*(2134/4225)=4559/845.

So, x=10 - (4559/845)= (8450/845 -4559/845)= (8450 -4559)/845= 3891/845.

Similarly, compute y=(30√14/11)t= (30√14/11)*(2134/4225).

Compute numerator:30*2134=64,020.

Denominator:11*4225=46,475.

So, y=64,020√14 /46,475.

Simplify numerator and denominator:

Divide numerator and denominator by 5: 12,804√14 /9,295.

Check if 12,804 and 9,295 have common factors.

Compute GCD(12804,9295).

12804 ÷9295=1 rem 3509.

GCD(9295,3509).

9295 ÷3509=2 rem 2277.

GCD(3509,2277).

3509-2277=1232.

GCD(2277,1232).

2277 ÷1232=1 rem 1045.

GCD(1232,1045).

1232-1045=187.

GCD(1045,187)= same as before, GCD is 11.

So, divide numerator and denominator by 11:

12,804 ÷11=1,164.

9,295 ÷11=845.

So, y=1,164√14 /845.

So, point P has coordinates (3891/845, 1164√14/845).

Now, we need to find the length AP.

Point A is at (10,0) and point P is at (3891/845, 1164√14/845).

Compute the distance between A and P.

First, compute Δx=3891/845 -10= (3891 -8450)/845= (-4559)/845.

Δy=1164√14/845 -0=1164√14/845.

So, AP= sqrt( (Δx)^2 + (Δy)^2 )= sqrt( ( (-4559/845)^2 ) + (1164√14/845)^2 )

Factor out 1/845^2:

AP= (1/845) * sqrt(4559² + (1164² *14) ).

Compute 4559² and 1164²:

First, compute 4559²:

4559 *4559. Hmm, that's a big number. Let's compute:

4559^2 = (4500 +59)^2=4500² +2*4500*59 +59²=20,250,000 +531,000 +3,481=20,250,000 +531,000=20,781,000 +3,481=20,784,481.

Next, compute 1164²:

1164^2= (1000 +164)^2=1000² +2*1000*164 +164²=1,000,000 +328,000 +26,896=1,000,000 +328,000=1,328,000 +26,896=1,354,896.

Multiply by 14: 1,354,896 *14=19,  let's compute:

1,354,896 *10=13,548,960

1,354,896 *4=5,419,584

Total=13,548,960 +5,419,584=18,968,544.

So, sqrt(20,784,481 +18,968,544 )=sqrt(40,753,025).

Compute sqrt(40,753,025).

Let me see: 6,385^2=?

6,385^2: compute 6,000^2=36,000,000.

385^2=148,225.

2*6,000*385=4,620,000.

So, (6,385)^2=36,000,000 +4,620,000 +148,225=40,768,225.

Wait, but 40,753,025 is less than that.

Wait, 6,380^2= (6,300 +80)^2=6,300² +2*6,300*80 +80²=39,690,000 +1,008,000 +6,400=40,704,400.

40,704,400. We have 40,753,025 -40,704,400=48,625.

So, (6,380 + x)^2=40,753,025.

Find x where (6,380 +x)^2=40,704,400 + 2*6,380 x +x²=40,704,400 +12,760x +x²=40,753,025.

So, 12,760x +x²=48,625.

Assume x is small, so x² is negligible.

12,760x≈48,625 → x≈48,625 /12,760≈3.807.

Check 6,380 +3=6,383. 6,383²=6,380² +2*6,380*3 +3²=40,704,400 +38,280 +9=40,742,689.

Which is less than 40,753,025.

Difference:40,753,025 -40,742,689=10,336.

So, try x=3.807. Let's compute 6,383 + y:

Wait, maybe better to compute 6,383²=40,742,689.

40,753,025 -40,742,689=10,336.

Compute (6,383 + y)^2=40,742,689 + 2*6,383 y + y²=40,753,025.

So, 12,766 y ≈10,336 → y≈10,336 /12,766≈0.807.

So, x≈3.807.

So, sqrt(40,753,025)=6,383.807≈6,383.807.

But perhaps 6,385^2 is 40,768,225, which is larger than 40,753,025.

Wait, alternatively, maybe it's 6,385 - something.

Wait, 6,385^2=40,768,225.

40,768,225 -40,753,025=15,200.

So, 6,385^2=40,753,025 +15,200.

Wait, that's not helpful.

Wait, perhaps 6,385 - 12=6,373.

Compute 6,373^2: 6,373^2=?

6,373=6,300 +73.

(6,300 +73)^2=6,300^2 +2*6,300*73 +73^2=39,690,000 +911,400 +5,329=40,606,729.

Which is way lower than 40,753,025.

Hmm, maybe my approach is wrong. Alternatively, perhaps 6,385 -12=6,373, which we saw gives 40,606,729. Not helpful.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake earlier.

Wait, wait, 6,385^2= (6,300 +85)^2=6,300² +2*6,300*85 +85²=39,690,000 +1,071,000 +7,225=40,768,225.

Which is correct.

So, 40,753,025 is 15,200 less than 40,768,225.

So, sqrt(40,753,025)=6,385 - (15,200)/(2*6,385) approximately.

Which is 6,385 -15,200/(12,770)=6,385 - approx 1.19.

So, sqrt≈6,383.81.

But this is getting too messy. Maybe the number 40,753,025 is a perfect square. Let's check.

Compute 6,385 -12=6,373: 6,373²=40,606,729.

6,373 +100=6,473. 6,473²= (6,400 +73)^2=40,960,000 + 2*6,400*73 +73²=40,960,000 + 934,400 +5,329=41,899,729.

Wait, 40,753,025 is between 40,606,729 and 41,899,729.

Wait, perhaps 6,385 - 13=6,372. 6,372²= (6,370 +2)^2=6,370² +4 +4*6,370=40,566,900 +4 +25,480=40,602,384.

Still lower.

Wait, perhaps 6,385 - 18=6,367. 6,367²=?

6,367=6,300 +67.

(6,300 +67)^2=6,300² + 2*6,300*67 +67²=39,690,000 +869,400 +4,489=40,563,889.

Still lower.

Wait, perhaps I need another approach. Alternatively, perhaps 40,753,025 is 6,385² -15,200. So, not a perfect square. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating 4559² and 1164².

Wait, let's verify 4559²:

4559 *4559.

Compute 4559 *4559:

Compute 4559 *4559 as follows:

= (4500 +59)^2

=4500² +2*4500*59 +59²

=20,250,000 + 2*4500*59 +3,481

Compute 2*4500*59=9000*59=531,000.

So, 20,250,000 +531,000=20,781,000.

20,781,000 +3,481=20,784,481. So that's correct.

1164²:

1164 *1164.

Compute 1164²:

= (1000 +164)^2

=1,000,000 + 2*1000*164 +164²

=1,000,000 +328,000 +26,896

=1,000,000 +328,000=1,328,000

1,328,000 +26,896=1,354,896.

So, 1,354,896 *14=18,968,544. Correct.

So, 20,784,481 +18,968,544=40,753,025.

Wait, 40,753,025. Let me check if this is a perfect square.

Compute 6,385²=40,768,225.

40,768,225 -40,753,025=15,200.

So, it's less than 6,385² by 15,200.

So, sqrt(40,753,025)=6,385 - (15,200)/(2*6,385)=6,385 -15,200/12,770≈6,385 -1.19≈6,383.81.

But since we can't have an exact value, perhaps 40,753,025 is a perfect square. Wait, let me check sqrt(40,753,025).

Wait, 6,385²=40,768,225.

So, 40,753,025 is less than that by 15,200. So, perhaps it's 6,385 - x, where x is around 1.19.

But I don't think it's a perfect square, so maybe I messed up the earlier steps.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating coordinates.

Wait, maybe instead of using coordinates, there's a better way. Since we found DB=225/22, then using power of a point:

DB²= (225/22)^2= (225^2)/(22^2)=50,625 /484.

Also, power of D is DA * DP=50,625 /484.

But DA is the distance from D to A, and DP is DA + AP.

So, DA * (DA + AP)=50,625/484.

But I don't know DA yet.

Wait, but if I can find DA, then I can set up the equation and solve for AP.

So, let's compute DA.

Point D is at (-15/22,30√14/11), and point A is at (10,0).

Compute DA:

DA= sqrt[ (10 - (-15/22))² + (0 -30√14/11)^2 ]

Compute Δx=10 +15/22=220/22 +15/22=235/22.

Δy= -30√14/11.

So, DA= sqrt[ (235/22)^2 + (30√14/11)^2 ]

Compute each term:

(235/22)^2=55,225 /484.

(30√14/11)^2=900*14 /121=12,600 /121.

Convert 12,600/121 to denominator 484: multiply numerator and denominator by4:50,400/484.

So, DA²=55,225/484 +50,400/484=105,625/484.

So, DA= sqrt(105,625/484)=sqrt(105,625)/sqrt(484)=325/22.

So, DA=325/22.

So, DA=325/22, and power of D is DA * DP= (325/22) * DP= (225/22)^2=50,625/484.

So,

(325/22)*DP=50,625/484.

Solve for DP:

DP= (50,625/484) / (325/22)= (50,625/484) * (22/325)= (50,625 *22)/(484 *325).

Simplify:

50,625=225^2; 484=22^2; 325=25*13.

So,

(225² * 22)/(22² *25*13)= (225²)/(22 *25*13).

Simplify 225²=50,625.

22*25=550; 550*13=7,150.

So, DP=50,625 /7,150.

Simplify this fraction.

Divide numerator and denominator by 25: numerator=2,025; denominator=286.

So, DP=2,025/286.

But 2,025 and 286: 286=2*11*13. 2,025=25*81=25*9². No common factors. So, DP=2,025/286.

But DP=DA + AP → 2,025/286=325/22 + AP.

Compute 325/22 in terms of denominator 286: 325/22= (325*13)/(22*13)=4,225/286.

So,

2,025/286=4,225/286 + AP → AP=2,025/286 -4,225/286= (2,025 -4,225)/286= (-2,200)/286.

Wait, that can't be. AP can't be negative.

Wait, maybe I messed up the direction. Earlier, I thought that DP=DA + AP, but since A is between D and P, DA is from D to A, and AP is from A to P, so DP=DA + AP.

But according to the calculation, DP=2,025/286=approx 7.09, and DA=325/22≈14.77. So, 7.09=14.77 + AP → AP= -7.68, which is impossible.

So, clearly, I messed up the direction. Maybe DP=DA - AP? Because if A is between D and P, then DA is longer than DP? No, that can't be because D is outside the circle, so DA is the distance from D to A, which is on the circle, and DP is the distance from D to P, which is on the other side. So, AP would be the extension beyond A, meaning DP=DA + AP.

Wait, but according to the power of point formula, it's DP * DA = DB², but that would mean DA * DP= DB², which is 50,625 /484.

But if DA=325/22≈14.77, and DP=2,025/286≈7.09, then DA * DP≈14.77 *7.09≈104.6.

But DB²= (225/22)^2≈(10.227)^2≈104.6. So, the calculation is correct.

But then DP=7.09, and DA=14.77, so AP=DP - DA=7.09 -14.77= -7.68, which is negative. Which doesn't make sense.

Wait, perhaps I have the direction wrong. Maybe it's AP= DA - DP.

Wait, AP is the distance from A to P, so if DA is from D to A, and DP is from D to P, then AP= |DP - DA| if A is between D and P. Since DA is longer than DP, AP= DA - DP.

So, AP= DA - DP=325/22 -2,025/286.

Convert to common denominator: denominator 286.

325/22= (325*13)/286=4,225/286.

So, AP=4,225/286 -2,025/286= (4,225 -2,025)/286=2,200/286.

Simplify 2,200/286.

Divide numerator and denominator by 2: 1,100/143.

Check if reducible: 143=11*13; 1,100=100*11.

So, 1,100/143=100/13.

Wait, 143*7=1,001. 143*7=1,001, so 143*7.692=1,100.

Wait, 143*7=1,001; 1,100-1,001=99.

So, 1,100/143=7 +99/143=7 +9*11/(11*13)=7 +9/13=7 9/13.

But as an improper fraction, 1,100/143=92.23? Wait, 143*7=1,001, 143*7.692≈1,100.

Wait, 143*7=1,001; 143*7.692≈1,001 +143*0.692≈1,001 +99≈1,100.

But 1,100/143= (1,100 ÷11)/(143 ÷11)=100/13.

Wait, 143 ÷11=13, yes. 1,100 ÷11=100. So, 1,100/143=100/13.

So, AP=100/13.

So, m=100, n=13. They are coprime. So, m +n=113.

Wait, let me confirm this:

AP= DA - DP=325/22 -2025/286.

325/22= (325*13)/286=4,225/286.

2025/286 remains.

4,225 -2,025=2,200.

2,200/286= (2,200 ÷2)/(286 ÷2)=1,100/143=100/13.

Yes, correct.

So, AP=100/13, so m +n=100 +13=113.

To solve for \( AP \), we use the power of point \( D \) with respect to the circumcircle of \( \triangle ABC \). The power of \( D \) is given by \( DB^2 = DP \cdot DA \). We calculate \( DB \) using the Law of Cosines and find \( DA \) using coordinate geometry. Finally, solving the equation \( DB^2 = DP \cdot DA \) gives us \( AP = \frac{100}{13} \).

\(\boxed{113}\)
