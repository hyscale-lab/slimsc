Okay, so I need to figure out how many positive integers n ≤ 2024 where Bob can guarantee a win in this game. Let me try to understand the rules first.

The game is between Alice and Bob, starting with n tokens. They take turns, Alice goes first. On each turn, a player can remove either 1 or 4 tokens. The person who takes the last token wins. So, the goal is to be the one to take the last token. I need to find all n up to 2024 where Bob has a winning strategy, meaning no matter how Alice plays, Bob can always win.

Hmm, this sounds like a combinatorial game theory problem. These often involve figuring out winning and losing positions. A position is a losing position if the player whose turn it is cannot force a win, assuming the opponent plays optimally. So, I need to determine the losing positions where Bob can force Alice into a losing position on her first move.

Let me think about small values of n first and see if I can find a pattern.

n=1: Alice takes 1 token and wins. So, Bob can't win here. So n=1 is a losing position for Bob.

n=2: Alice can take 1 token, leaving 1 for Bob. Then Bob can take that 1 and win. Wait, no, because if Alice leaves 1 token after taking 1, Bob would take it and win. So, in that case, Bob would win. Wait, but wait, if n=2, Alice's options are to take 1 or 4. She can't take 4 because there are only 2 tokens. So she takes 1, leaving 1 for Bob, who then takes it and wins. So, in n=2, Alice can't force Bob to lose, because Bob can win. Wait, but Alice is the first player. So, if n=2, Alice takes 1, leaving 1 for Bob, who takes it and wins. So Bob wins. But that's not right because if Alice leaves 1 token for Bob, Bob can take it and win. So for n=2, Alice can't win because Bob can take the last token. Wait, that doesn't make sense because Alice is going first. Wait, no, Alice takes 1, leaving 1 for Bob, who takes it and wins. So Bob wins when n=2. So n=2 is a winning position for Alice? Or is it a losing position for Alice?

Wait, maybe I'm confused. Let me clarify the definitions. A position is a losing position if the player whose turn it is cannot force a win. So, if it's Bob's turn, and he's facing n=1, he can take it and win. But in the game, the initial player is Alice. So, maybe I should model this from Alice's perspective.

Wait, perhaps I should model this recursively. Let me define a position as losing if the current player cannot force a win. So, for n=0, it's an invalid position because there are no tokens. For n=1, the current player can take 1 and win, so it's a winning position. For n=2, the current player can take 1, leaving 1 for the opponent, who can then take it and win. Or can the current player take 4? No, n=2 is less than 4, so the only move is to take 1, leaving n=1, which is a winning position for the opponent. Thus, n=2 is a losing position because the current player can't force a win. Wait, but n=2: current player takes 1, leaving n=1 for the opponent, who can take it and win. So, the current player cannot force a win, making n=2 a losing position. So, if the current player is Bob when n=2, Bob can take 1, leaving 1 for Alice, who would then be forced to take it and lose? Wait, no, because if Bob is the one whose turn it is when n=2, he can take 1, leaving n=1 for Alice, who then takes the last token and wins. So Bob doesn't win in that case. Therefore, n=2 is a losing position for Bob. Wait, this is getting confusing.

Let me try to approach this systematically. Let me define P(n) as true if the current player can force a win from n tokens, and false otherwise.

Base cases:
- P(0) is false, because there are no tokens to take, so the player can't win.
- P(1) is true: take 1 and win.
- P(2): current player can take 1, leaving 1 for the opponent, who can then take it and win. So P(2) is false because the current player can't force a win. Wait, no, if the current player takes 1, leaving n=1, which is a winning position for the opponent, meaning the opponent can take it and win, which means the current player can't force a win. So P(2) is false.

Similarly, P(3): the current player can take 1, leaving 2, which is a losing position for the opponent. So if current player takes 1, opponent is faced with P(2)=false, so opponent can't win. Therefore, current player can force a win. So P(3)=true.

P(4): current player can take 4 and win immediately. So P(4)=true.

P(5): current player can take 1, leaving 4 (which is a winning position for the opponent), or take 4, leaving 1 (which is a winning position for the opponent). Wait, but if both options leave the opponent in a winning position, then P(5)=false. Because no matter what the current player does, the opponent can win. So P(5)=false.

Wait, let me recheck that. For P(5), current player can take 1, leaving 4. P(4)=true, so opponent can win. Or take 4, leaving 1, which is P(1)=true, so opponent can win. So yes, P(5)=false.

P(6): current player can take 1, leaving 5, which is P(5)=false. So opponent can't win, meaning current player can force a win by taking 1. So P(6)=true.

P(7): current player can take 1, leaving 6 (P(6)=true), so opponent can win. Or take 4, leaving 3 (P(3)=true), so opponent can win. So both options leave opponent in a winning position, so P(7)=false.

P(8): current player can take 1, leaving 7 (P(7)=false). So current player can take 1 and force opponent into a losing position, so P(8)=true.

P(9): current player can take 1, leaving 8 (P(8)=true), or take 4, leaving 5 (P(5)=false). So if current player takes 4, leaving 5, which is a losing position for the opponent. So P(9)=true.

P(10): current player can take 1, leaving 9 (P(9)=true), or take 4, leaving 6 (P(6)=true). So both options leave opponent in a winning position, so P(10)=false.

Hmm, so the pattern so far is:

n: 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10

P(n): F T F T T F T F T T F

So, let's list the losing positions (P(n)=false) up to n=10: 0,2,5,7,10.

Wait, 0 is the losing position when there are no tokens. But in our problem, n starts at 1, so the losing positions for the first player (Alice) would be n=2,5,7,10.

Wait, but in our problem, we need to find n where Bob can force a win, regardless of Alice's play. So, for Bob to have a winning strategy, n must be such that when it's Alice's turn, she is in a losing position. Because if Alice is in a losing position, then Bob can win.

Wait, but in the initial problem, Alice goes first. So, for Bob to have a winning strategy, the initial position n must be a losing position for Alice, meaning P(n)=false. Because if P(n)=false, Alice can't force a win, so Bob can.

So, the losing positions for Alice (where P(n)=false) are n=2,5,7,10, etc.

Wait, but let me check my earlier analysis again to make sure I'm correct.

At n=2: Alice can take 1, leaving 1 for Bob, who then takes it and wins. So Bob wins. So, in this case, Alice is in a losing position, n=2 is a losing position for Alice, so Bob can win.

Similarly, n=5: Alice can take 1, leaving 4 for Bob, who can take 4 and win. Or take 4, leaving 1 for Bob, who takes it and wins. So, no matter what Alice does, Bob can win. So n=5 is a losing position for Alice.

n=7: If Alice takes 1, she leaves 6 for Bob, which is a winning position for Bob. If Alice takes 4, she leaves 3 for Bob, which is a winning position for Bob. So, Bob can win regardless of Alice's move. So, n=7 is a losing position for Alice.

n=10: Let's see. Alice can take 1, leaving 9. P(9)=true, so Bob can win. Or take 4, leaving 6. P(6)=true, so Bob can win. So, again, Alice is in a losing position because no matter what she does, Bob can win.

So, the losing positions for Alice are n=2,5,7,10. Let's see if there's a pattern here. Let me compute a few more terms to see if the pattern continues.

P(11): current player can take 1, leaving 10 (P(10)=false). So, current player can take 1 and leave opponent in a losing position. So P(11)=true.

P(12): current player can take 1, leaving 11 (P(11)=true), or take 4, leaving 8 (P(8)=true). So, both options leave opponent in a winning position, so P(12)=false.

Wait, so P(12)=false, which would mean n=12 is a losing position for Alice, so Bob can win.

Wait, so the losing positions are n=2,5,7,10,12,... Let me check P(13):

P(13): take 1, leaving 12 (P(12)=false). So current player can take 1 and force opponent into losing position, so P(13)=true.

P(14): take 1, leaving 13 (P(13)=true), or take 4, leaving 10 (P(10)=false). So, current player can take 4 and leave opponent with P(10)=false, so P(14)=true.

P(15): take 1, leaving 14 (P(14)=true), or take 4, leaving 11 (P(11)=true). So, both options leave opponent in a winning position, so P(15)=false.

So P(15)=false, so n=15 is a losing position for Alice.

Wait, so the losing positions so far are n=2,5,7,10,12,15. Hmm, what's the pattern here?

Looking at the differences between the losing positions:

2,5: +3

5,7: +2

7,10: +3

10,12: +2

12,15: +3

So, it alternates between adding 3 and 2. So the sequence is 2,5,7,10,12,15,17,20,22,25,... etc.

Let me check if this pattern continues. P(16):

P(16): take 1, leaving 15 (P(15)=false). So current player can take 1 and force opponent into losing position. So P(16)=true.

P(17): take 1, leaving 16 (P(16)=true), or take 4, leaving 13 (P(13)=true). So both options leave opponent in a winning position, so P(17)=false. So n=17 is a losing position.

P(18): take 1, leaving 17 (P(17)=false). So current player can take 1 and win, so P(18)=true.

P(19): take 1, leaving 18 (P(18)=true), or take 4, leaving 15 (P(15)=false). So current player can take 4 and leave opponent in losing position, so P(19)=true.

P(20): take 1, leaving 19 (P(19)=true), or take 4, leaving 16 (P(16)=true). So both options leave opponent in winning position, so P(20)=false. So n=20 is a losing position.

So the pattern continues: 2,5,7,10,12,15,17,20,22,25,...

So the losing positions are every 2 and 3 steps alternately. So, starting from 2, adding 3 (5), then 2 (7), then 3 (10), then 2 (12), then 3 (15), then 2 (17), then 3 (20), then 2 (22), etc.

So, the losing positions are numbers congruent to 2 mod 5, but wait, perhaps I can model this with a mathematical formula.

Wait, looking at the losing positions: 2,5,7,10,12,15,17,20,22,25,...

Let me see if these can be expressed in terms of some formula. Let's see:

Looking at the losing positions:

2,5,7,10,12,15,17,20,22,25,27,30,...

Hmm, perhaps they can be expressed as 2 mod 5 and 0 mod 5? Or perhaps another modulus.

Wait, 2 mod 5 is 2,7,12,17,22,27,... but 5 is 0 mod5, 10 is 0 mod5, 15 is 0 mod5, etc.

Wait, that doesn't fit. Alternatively, perhaps the losing positions are numbers where n ≡ 2 mod 5 or n ≡ 0 mod5. Wait, checking:

n=2: 2 mod5=2 → yes.

n=5: 5 mod5=0 → yes.

n=7: 7 mod5=2 → yes.

n=10:10 mod5=0 → yes.

n=12:12 mod5=2 → yes.

n=15:15 mod5=0 → yes.

n=17:17 mod5=2 → yes.

n=20:20 mod5=0 → yes.

Yes, that seems to fit. So the losing positions are n ≡0 mod5 and n≡2 mod5.

Wait, let me check n=25:25 mod5=0 → yes, it's a losing position. n=27:27 mod5=2 → yes.

So, the losing positions are numbers where n ≡0 or 2 mod5.

So, if n is congruent to 0 or 2 modulo 5, then Alice is in a losing position, so Bob can win.

Wait, let me confirm this with P(25). P(25)=false.

Wait, let's compute P(25):

P(25): current player can take 1, leaving 24 (P(24)=true), or take 4, leaving 21 (P(21)=true). So, no matter what the current player does, the opponent can win. So P(25)=false. So yes, it's a losing position.

Similarly, P(27):

P(27): take 1, leaving 26 (P(26)=true), or take 4, leaving 23 (P(23)=true). So, P(27)=false, which matches n=27 being 2 mod5.

So, the losing positions are n where n ≡0 or 2 mod5.

Therefore, for Bob to have a winning strategy, n must be ≡0 or 2 mod5.

So, the problem asks for the number of positive integers n ≤2024 where Bob can win, which is the number of n ≤2024 where n ≡0 or 2 mod5.

So, how many numbers ≤2024 are congruent to 0 or 2 modulo5?

We can compute the count for each congruence and sum them.

For n ≡0 mod5:

The smallest is 5, the largest ≤2024 is 2020 (since 2020=5*404). So the count is 404 (from 5*1 to 5*404).

Wait, but wait: 5*404=2020, and 2020 ≤2024. So the number of terms is 404.

Similarly, for n≡2 mod5:

The smallest is 2, the largest ≤2024 is 2022 (since 2022=5*404 + 2=2020+2=2022). So the number of terms is 404 as well.

Wait, but let me check:

For n≡0 mod5:

Numbers are 5,10,15,...,2020.

Number of terms: (2020 -5)/5 +1 = (2015)/5 +1 =403+1=404.

For n≡2 mod5:

Numbers are 2,7,12,...,2022.

Number of terms: (2022-2)/5 +1 =2020/5 +1=404+1=405.

Wait, wait, let me compute correctly.

Wait, for n≡2 mod5, the first term is 2, and the last term is 2022.

The number of terms is ((2022 -2)/5) +1 = (2020/5)+1 =404 +1=405.

Similarly, for n≡0 mod5, the last term is 2020, which is 5*404, so the number of terms is 404.

So total numbers where n ≡0 or 2 mod5 is 404 +405=809.

Wait, but let me double-check.

Wait, the number of terms in an arithmetic sequence is given by:

Number of terms = ((last - first) / step) +1.

For n≡0 mod5:

First term:5, last term:2020.

((2020 -5)/5)+1 = (2015/5)+1=403+1=404.

For n≡2 mod5:

First term:2, last term:2022.

((2022 -2)/5)+1= (2020/5)+1=404+1=405.

So total is 404+405=809.

But wait, let me check if 2022 is indeed ≤2024. Yes, 2022 is less than 2024, so it's included.

So, the total number of n ≤2024 where Bob can guarantee a win is 809.

Wait, but let me confirm that n=2025 would be 2025 mod5=0, but 2025>2024, so not included.

So, the answer is 809.

Wait, but let me check if 2022 is indeed the last term for n≡2 mod5.

n=2022: 2022/5=404.4, so 5*404=2020, 2020+2=2022, yes.

So, the count is correct.

Thus, the number of positive integers n ≤2024 where Bob can guarantee a win is 809.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the number of positive integers \( n \leq 2024 \) for which Bob can guarantee a win, we analyze the game's winning and losing positions. A position \( n \) is losing if the current player cannot force a win, regardless of the opponent's moves.

We start by examining small values of \( n \) and identifying patterns. Through recursive analysis, we find that the losing positions (where the current player cannot force a win) occur at \( n \equiv 0 \pmod{5} \) and \( n \equiv 2 \pmod{5} \).

For \( n \equiv 0 \pmod{5} \):
- The sequence is \( 5, 10, 15, \ldots, 2020 \).
- Number of terms: \( \frac{2020 - 5}{5} + 1 = 404 \).

For \( n \equiv 2 \pmod{5} \):
- The sequence is \( 2, 7, 12, \ldots, 2022 \).
- Number of terms: \( \frac{2022 - 2}{5} + 1 = 405 \).

Summing these, the total number of losing positions \( n \leq 2024 \) is \( 404 + 405 = 809 \).

Thus, the number of positive integers \( n \leq 2024 \) where Bob can guarantee a win is:

\boxed{809}
