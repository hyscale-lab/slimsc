Okay, so I'm trying to solve this problem where I need to find the largest possible real part of the expression \[(75+117i)z + \frac{96+144i}{z}\], given that \( z \) is a complex number with \( |z| = 4 \). Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.

First, I remember that any complex number \( z \) with modulus 4 can be written in the form \( z = 4e^{i\theta} \), where \( \theta \) is the argument of \( z \). That might make things easier because it's often simpler to work with exponentials when dealing with modulus and arguments.

Let me write down \( z = 4e^{i\theta} \). Then, \( 1/z \) would be \( \frac{1}{4}e^{-i\theta} \) because \( |1/z| = 1/|z| = 1/4 \).

So substituting \( z \) into the original expression, I get:

\[
(75 + 117i) \cdot 4e^{i\theta} + \frac{96 + 144i}{4e^{i\theta}}
\]

Simplify each term:

First term: \( (75 + 117i) \cdot 4e^{i\theta} = 4(75 + 117i)e^{i\theta} \)

Second term: \( \frac{96 + 144i}{4e^{i\theta}} = \frac{96 + 144i}{4} \cdot e^{-i\theta} = (24 + 36i)e^{-i\theta} \)

So the entire expression is:

\[
4(75 + 117i)e^{i\theta} + (24 + 36i)e^{-i\theta}
\]

Hmm, maybe I can factor this expression further or find a common form. Let me denote \( A = 75 + 117i \) and \( B = 24 + 36i \), so the expression becomes \( 4A e^{i\theta} + B e^{-i\theta} \).

I need to find the real part of this expression, so let me compute each part's real component.

I know that \( e^{i\theta} = \cos\theta + i\sin\theta \) and \( e^{-i\theta} = \cos\theta - i\sin\theta \).

So, the first term:

\( 4A e^{i\theta} = 4(75 + 117i)(\cos\theta + i\sin\theta) \)

Let me multiply this out:

First, \( 75(\cos\theta + i\sin\theta) = 75\cos\theta + 75i\sin\theta \)

Then, \( 117i(\cos\theta + i\sin\theta) = 117i\cos\theta + 117i^2\sin\theta = 117i\cos\theta - 117\sin\theta \) (since \( i^2 = -1 \))

Adding these together:

\( 75\cos\theta - 117\sin\theta + i(75\sin\theta + 117\cos\theta) \)

Multiply by 4:

\( 4(75\cos\theta - 117\sin\theta) + i4(75\sin\theta + 117\cos\theta) \)

Which simplifies to:

\( 300\cos\theta - 468\sin\theta + i(300\sin\theta + 468\cos\theta) \)

Similarly, the second term:

\( B e^{-i\theta} = (24 + 36i)(\cos\theta - i\sin\theta) \)

Multiplying this out:

\( 24\cos\theta - 24i\sin\theta + 36i\cos\theta - 36i^2\sin\theta \)

Simplify:

\( 24\cos\theta -24i\sin\theta + 36i\cos\theta + 36\sin\theta \) (since \( i^2 = -1 \))

Group real and imaginary parts:

Real: \( 24\cos\theta + 36\sin\theta \)

Imaginary: \( (-24\sin\theta + 36\cos\theta)i \)

So, the entire expression is:

First term + Second term = \( (300\cos\theta - 468\sin\theta) + i(300\sin\theta + 468\cos\theta) + (24\cos\theta + 36\sin\theta) + i(-24\sin\theta + 36\cos\theta) \)

Combine like terms:

Real parts:

\( (300\cos\theta - 468\sin\theta) + (24\cos\theta + 36\sin\theta) = (300 + 24)\cos\theta + (-468 + 36)\sin\theta = 324\cos\theta - 432\sin\theta \)

Imaginary parts:

\( (300\sin\theta + 468\cos\theta) + (-24\sin\theta + 36\cos\theta) = (300 - 24)\sin\theta + (468 + 36)\cos\theta = 276\sin\theta + 504\cos\theta \)

So, the expression simplifies to:

\( (324\cos\theta - 432\sin\theta) + i(276\sin\theta + 504\cos\theta) \)

But we're only interested in the real part, so that's:

\( 324\cos\theta - 432\sin\theta \)

Our goal is to find the maximum value of this real part as \( \theta \) varies. So, we need to maximize \( 324\cos\theta - 432\sin\theta \).

Hmm, I remember that expressions of the form \( a\cos\theta + b\sin\theta \) can be rewritten as \( R\cos(\theta + \phi) \) where \( R = \sqrt{a^2 + b^2} \) and \( \phi = \arctan(b/a) \) or something like that. Wait, actually, it's \( R\cos(\theta - \phi) \) or \( R\sin(\theta + \phi) \), depending on convention.

Let me recall: \( a\cos\theta + b\sin\theta = R\cos(\theta - \phi) \), where \( R = \sqrt{a^2 + b^2} \) and \( \phi = \arctan(b/a) \). Alternatively, sometimes it's written as \( R\sin(\theta + \phi) \), but the exact form depends on whether you're expressing it in terms of sine or cosine.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to think of it as \( R \cos(\theta + \phi) \), where \( R \) is the amplitude and \( \phi \) is a phase shift. In any case, the maximum value of this expression would be \( R \), since the maximum of cosine is 1, and similarly, the minimum would be \( -R \).

So, to find the maximum of \( 324\cos\theta - 432\sin\theta \), I can write this as \( R\cos(\theta + \phi) \), and the maximum value will be \( R \).

Let me compute \( R \):

\( R = \sqrt{324^2 + (-432)^2} \)

Calculating that:

First, \( 324^2 \): 324 * 324. Hmm, 300^2 is 90,000, 24^2 is 576, and cross terms are 2*300*24=14,400. So 90,000 + 14,400 + 576 = 104,976.

Wait, no, actually, 324^2: Let's compute 324*324:

300*300 = 90,000

300*24 = 7,200

24*300 = 7,200

24*24 = 576

So, 90,000 + 7,200 + 7,200 + 576 = 90,000 + 14,400 + 576 = 104,976.

Similarly, (-432)^2 is 432^2. Let me compute 400^2=160,000, 32^2=1,024, and 2*400*32=25,600. So, 160,000 + 25,600 + 1,024 = 186,624.

So, R^2 = 104,976 + 186,624 = 291,600.

Therefore, R = sqrt(291,600). Let's compute that.

I know that 540^2 = (500 + 40)^2 = 500^2 + 2*500*40 + 40^2 = 250,000 + 40,000 + 1,600 = 291,600. So R = 540.

Therefore, the maximum value of \( 324\cos\theta - 432\sin\theta \) is 540.

So, the largest possible real part of the given expression is 540.

Wait, but let me double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.

Starting with the expression:

(75 + 117i)z + (96 + 144i)/z, with |z|=4.

Expressed z as 4e^{iθ}, so 1/z is (1/4)e^{-iθ}.

Substituted into the expression: 4(75 + 117i)e^{iθ} + (24 + 36i)e^{-iθ}.

Then I expanded both terms. For the first term, I correctly multiplied out (75 + 117i)(cosθ + i sinθ), getting 75 cosθ - 117 sinθ + i(75 sinθ + 117 cosθ), then multiplied by 4: 300 cosθ - 468 sinθ + i(300 sinθ + 468 cosθ).

Second term: (24 + 36i)(cosθ - i sinθ) becomes 24 cosθ + 36 sinθ + i(-24 sinθ + 36 cosθ). That seems correct.

Adding both terms: real parts (300 cosθ - 468 sinθ) + (24 cosθ + 36 sinθ) = 324 cosθ - 432 sinθ.

Imaginary parts: (300 sinθ + 468 cosθ) + (-24 sinθ + 36 cosθ) = 276 sinθ + 504 cosθ, which I didn't need for the real part.

So the real part is 324 cosθ - 432 sinθ. To find the maximum, I calculated R as sqrt(324^2 + (-432)^2) = 540. So the maximum is 540.

That seems correct. So the largest possible real part is 540.
