Okay, so I need to find the length of AP in triangle ABC where ABC is inscribed in a circle ω. The tangents at B and C meet at D, and AD intersects ω again at P. The sides are given: AB=5, BC=9, and AC=10. I need to express AP as a reduced fraction m/n and find m + n.

First, let me visualize the problem. Triangle ABC with AB=5, BC=9, AC=10. Since the sides are all given, maybe I can find some angles or other lengths using the Law of Cosines or Law of Sines. But the problem involves tangents and a point D where the tangents at B and C meet. Then AD intersects the circumcircle again at P.

I remember that the point where two tangents meet is called the exsymcon or something like that. Also, the tangent from a point to a circle is equal in length. So, DB and DC are equal because they're both tangents from D to ω. So triangle DBC is isoceles with DB = DC.

Let me try to draw this in my mind: ABC with AB=5, BC=9, AC=10. The circumcircle ω passes through all three. The tangents at B and C meet at D. So D is outside the circle, and DB and DC are equal.

I think I can use properties of poles and polars here, but maybe that's too advanced. Alternatively, perhaps power of a point. Since D is the intersection of two tangents, the power of D with respect to ω is DB² = DC².

Power of point D: DB² = DC² = DA * DP, because AD is a secant line intersecting the circle at A and P. So DP = (DB²) / DA.

Wait, but I don't know DA yet. So I need to find DA first.

How can I find DA? Maybe using triangle properties. Let me think. Since D is the intersection of the tangents at B and C, maybe I can find coordinates or use coordinate geometry.

Alternatively, maybe use Ceva's theorem or Menelaus. Hmm. Alternatively, use coordinates.

Let me try coordinate geometry. Let me place point C at the origin (0,0). Let me place point A somewhere on the x-axis, say at (10,0) because AC=10. Then point B is somewhere in the plane. Let me find coordinates of B.

Given triangle ABC with AB=5, BC=9, AC=10.

So points: C(0,0), A(10,0). Let me find coordinates of B.

Using the distance formula:

AB = 5: The distance from A(10,0) to B(x,y) is 5.

So sqrt( (x-10)^2 + (y)^2 ) = 5 → (x-10)^2 + y^2 = 25.

BC = 9: The distance from B(x,y) to C(0,0) is 9.

So sqrt(x^2 + y^2) =9 → x² + y² =81.

So we have two equations:

1. (x-10)^2 + y^2 = 25

2. x² + y² =81

Subtract equation 2 from equation 1:

(x-10)^2 + y^2 - x² - y² = 25 -81 → (x² -20x +100) -x² = -56 → -20x +100 = -56 → -20x = -156 → x = 156/20 = 39/5 = 7.8.

So x = 39/5. Then substitute back into equation 2: x² + y² =81.

x² = (39/5)^2 = (1521/25). So y² =81 - 1521/25 = (2025 - 1521)/25 = 504/25. So y = sqrt(504)/5.

Simplify sqrt(504): 504=16*31.5=16*9*3.5=16*9*7/2 → Wait, 504 = 16*31.5? No, 16*31.5 = 504? Let me compute 16*31=496, 16*31.5=504. So 504 = 16*31.5=16*(63/2)= (16*63)/2= (1008)/2=504. So sqrt(504)=sqrt(16*31.5)=4*sqrt(31.5). Hmm, but 31.5 is 63/2, so sqrt(63/2)=sqrt(63)/sqrt(2)= (3*sqrt(7))/sqrt(2). Therefore, sqrt(504)=4*(3*sqrt(7))/sqrt(2)=12*sqrt(7)/sqrt(2)=12*sqrt(14)/2=6*sqrt(14).

Wait, let me do it step by step:

504 divided by 4 is 126. So 504=4*126. 126=9*14. So 504=4*9*14=36*14. So sqrt(504) = sqrt(36*14)=6*sqrt(14). So y=6*sqrt(14)/5.

So point B is at (39/5, 6√14/5). So coordinates are:

A(10,0), B(39/5, 6√14/5), C(0,0).

Now, need to find point D, the intersection of tangents at B and C.

How do I find the tangent at a point on a circle? The tangent at a point on a circle is perpendicular to the radius at that point. So if I have the center of the circle, O, then the tangent at B is perpendicular to OB, and the tangent at C is perpendicular to OC.

First, I need to find the circumcircle ω of triangle ABC. So find the circumradius and the coordinates of the center O.

To find the circumcenter O, which is the intersection of the perpendicular bisectors of AB and AC.

Compute the midpoint of AB and AC, then find the equations of their perpendicular bisectors.

Midpoint of AC: A(10,0), C(0,0). Midpoint is (5,0). The slope of AC is (0-0)/(0-10)=0, so it's horizontal. The perpendicular bisector is vertical, x=5.

Midpoint of AB: A(10,0), B(39/5,6√14/5). Coordinates:

Midpoint M: ( (10 + 39/5)/2 , (0 + 6√14/5)/2 )

Compute 10 = 50/5, so 50/5 + 39/5 = 89/5. Divide by 2: 89/10.

Similarly, 0 + 6√14/5 = 6√14/5. Divide by 2: 3√14/5.

So midpoint M is (89/10, 3√14/5).

The slope of AB is (6√14/5 - 0)/(39/5 -10) = (6√14/5) / (39/5 -50/5) = (6√14/5)/(-11/5) = -6√14/11.

So the perpendicular bisector of AB has slope reciprocal and opposite: 11/(6√14).

So equation of perpendicular bisector of AB: passes through M(89/10, 3√14/5), slope 11/(6√14).

Equation: y - 3√14/5 = (11/(6√14))(x - 89/10).

We also have the perpendicular bisector of AC is x=5. So the circumcenter O is at x=5, plug into the other equation.

So set x=5 and solve for y.

y - 3√14/5 = (11/(6√14))(5 - 89/10).

Compute 5 - 89/10: 50/10 - 89/10 = (-39/10).

So, y = 3√14/5 + (11/(6√14))*(-39/10).

Compute this:

First, let's compute (11/(6√14))*(-39/10) = (-429)/(60√14) = (-143)/(20√14).

So, y = (3√14)/5 - 143/(20√14).

Let me rationalize the denominators:

(3√14)/5 = (3√14)/5.

143/(20√14) = (143√14)/(20*14) = (143√14)/280.

So, y = (3√14)/5 - (143√14)/280.

Convert to a common denominator:

3√14/5 = (168√14)/280.

So y = (168√14 - 143√14)/280 = (25√14)/280 = (5√14)/56.

So the circumcenter O is at (5, 5√14/56).

So O(5,5√14/56).

Now, the tangent at C: point C is (0,0), and the radius OC has slope (5√14/56 - 0)/(5 -0) = (5√14/56)/5 = √14/56. So the tangent at C is perpendicular to OC, so its slope is -56/√14.

Simplify: 56/√14 = (56√14)/14 = 4√14. So the slope is -4√14.

So equation of tangent at C: passes through (0,0), slope -4√14. So equation is y = -4√14 x.

Similarly, tangent at B: point B(39/5,6√14/5). The radius OB has slope (6√14/5 - 5√14/56)/(39/5 -5).

Compute numerator: 6√14/5 -5√14/56 = (6√14 *56 -5√14 *5)/(5*56) = (336√14 -25√14)/280 = 311√14/280.

Denominator: 39/5 -5 = 39/5 -25/5 =14/5.

So slope of OB is (311√14/280)/(14/5) = (311√14/280)*(5/14) = (311√14 *5)/(280*14) = (1555√14)/(3920).

Simplify: 1555 and 3920, do they have a common factor? Let's see: 1555 ÷5=311, 3920 ÷5=784. So 311/784. So slope is (311√14)/(784).

So the tangent at B is perpendicular to OB, so its slope is the negative reciprocal: -784/(311√14).

Simplify: rationalize denominator.

-784/(311√14) = -784√14/(311*14) = (-784/14) * √14/(311) = (-56√14)/311.

So equation of tangent at B: passes through (39/5,6√14/5), slope -56√14/311.

Equation: y -6√14/5 = (-56√14/311)(x -39/5).

So now, we have two tangent lines: at C is y = -4√14 x, and at B is y = (-56√14/311)(x -39/5) +6√14/5.

We need to find their intersection point D.

So solve the two equations:

1. y = -4√14 x.

2. y = (-56√14/311)(x -39/5) +6√14/5.

Set equation 1 equal to equation 2:

-4√14 x = (-56√14/311)(x -39/5) +6√14/5.

Let me multiply both sides by 311 to eliminate denominators:

-4√14 x *311 = -56√14 (x -39/5) +6√14 *311/5.

Simplify:

-1244√14 x = -56√14 x + (56√14 *39)/5 + (1866√14)/5.

Multiply all terms by 5 to eliminate denominators:

-6220√14 x = -280√14 x + 56√14 *39 +1866√14.

Compute 56*39: 56*30=1680, 56*9=504, total 1680+504=2184.

So,

-6220√14 x = -280√14 x +2184√14 +1866√14.

Combine like terms on the right:

2184√14 +1866√14 = (2184+1866)√14 = 4050√14.

So,

-6220√14 x +280√14 x = 4050√14.

Factor out √14:

√14*(-6220x +280x) = √14*4050.

Divide both sides by √14:

-6220x +280x =4050.

Compute -6220x +280x = (-6220 +280)x = (-5940)x.

So,

-5940x =4050.

Solve for x:

x= 4050 / (-5940) = simplify.

Divide numerator and denominator by 10: 405/-594.

Simplify further: divide numerator and denominator by 9: 45/-66. Again by 3: 15/-22.

So x= -15/22.

Now, plug x into equation 1: y = -4√14 x = -4√14*(-15/22) = (60√14)/22 = 30√14/11.

So point D is at (-15/22, 30√14/11).

Now, I need to find point P where line AD intersects the circumcircle ω again. Since A is already on ω, P is the other intersection.

First, find the parametric equation of line AD. Points A(10,0) and D(-15/22,30√14/11).

Let me find the vector from A to D: D - A = (-15/22 -10, 30√14/11 -0) = (-235/22, 30√14/11).

Parametric equations:

x =10 + (-235/22)t

y =0 + (30√14/11)t

Where t=0 at A, t=1 at D.

We can parametrize this line as:

x(t) =10 - (235/22)t

y(t) = (30√14/11) t

We need to find t where this line intersects ω again (i.e., P). So plug into the equation of ω.

Equation of ω: (x -5)^2 + (y -5√14/56)^2 = R^2, where R is the radius.

Wait, but we can compute R as the distance from O(5,5√14/56) to A(10,0):

OA: sqrt( (10-5)^2 + (0 -5√14/56)^2 )= sqrt(25 + (25*14)/(56^2)).

Wait, let me compute it:

(10-5)^2 =25.

(0 -5√14/56)^2 = (25*14)/(56^2)= (350)/(3136)= 350/3136= 25/224.

So OA^2 =25 +25/224= (25*224 +25)/224=25*(224+1)/224=25*225/224=5625/224.

So R^2=5625/224.

So equation of ω: (x -5)^2 + (y -5√14/56)^2 =5625/224.

Now, substitute x(t) and y(t) into this equation.

So,

[ (10 - (235/22)t -5 )^2 + ( (30√14/11 t) -5√14/56 )^2 ] =5625/224.

Simplify each term:

First term: (5 - (235/22)t )^2.

Second term: ( (30√14/11 t) -5√14/56 )^2.

Compute each part step by step.

First term squared:

(5 - (235/22)t )^2 = [5 - (235/22)t]^2 =25 - 2*5*(235/22)t + (235/22)^2 t².

=25 - (2350/22)t + (55225/484)t².

Simplify:

25 - (1175/11)t + (55225/484)t².

Second term squared:

( (30√14/11 t) -5√14/56 )^2.

Factor out √14:

√14(30/11 t -5/56). So squared: 14*(30/11 t -5/56)^2.

Compute inside the square:

(30/11 t -5/56). Let me find a common denominator, which is 11*56=616.

30/11 t = 30*56 t /616 = 1680 t /616.

5/56 = 55 t /616? Wait, no, 5/56 is 5/56, not involving t. Wait, it's 30/11 t -5/56.

So,

= (1680 t /616 -55/616) = (1680 t -55)/616.

So squared: (1680 t -55)^2 / (616)^2.

Multiply by 14: 14*(1680 t -55)^2/(616^2).

Simplify:

14*(1680 t -55)^2/(616^2).

Note that 616=1680/2.666... Hmm, maybe factor more.

Wait, 616=8*77=8*7*11.

1680= 168*10= 8*21*10= 8*3*7*2*5.

55=5*11.

So, the numerator is 14*(1680t -55)^2 =14*(1680t -55)^2.

Denominator: 616^2 = (8*7*11)^2= 64*49*121.

Simplify 14/(64*49*121) = (14)/(64*49*121) = (2*7)/(64*49*121).

But maybe it's easier to compute numerically.

Alternatively, let's compute each part step by step.

Wait, perhaps expanding is better, but this seems messy. Maybe there's a smarter way.

Wait, since point A is already on the circle, when t=0, the equation is satisfied. So the other intersection point is when t is such that the parametric equations are satisfied. So substituting into the circle equation, we'll get a quadratic equation in t. Since t=0 is a solution, we can solve for t and get the other solution.

Let me write the equation:

[5 - (235/22)t]^2 + [ (30√14/11 t -5√14/56 ) ]^2 =5625/224.

Let me compute each term separately.

First term: [5 - (235/22)t]^2.

Let me write 235/22 as approximately 10.68, but exact fractions are better.

Let me compute 5 - (235/22)t = (110/22 -235/22 t )= (110 -235 t)/22.

So squared: (110 -235 t)^2 / (22)^2.

Similarly, the second term:

(30√14/11 t -5√14/56 ) = √14*(30/11 t -5/56).

Compute the expression inside the square:

(30/11 t -5/56). Let me find a common denominator for 30/11 and 5/56.

The common denominator is 616.

30/11 = (30*56)/616 = 1680/616.

5/56 = (5*11)/616 =55/616.

So,

30/11 t -5/56 = (1680 t -55)/616.

So, the second term squared is [√14*(1680 t -55)/616]^2 =14*(1680 t -55)^2/(616)^2.

So now, the equation becomes:

[(110 -235 t)^2]/(22)^2 + [14*(1680 t -55)^2]/(616)^2 =5625/224.

Let me compute denominators:

22²=484.

616²=616*616. Let me compute 616²:

616*616: 600²=360000, 2*600*16=19200, 16²=256. So (600+16)²=600² +2*600*16 +16²=360000+19200+256=379456.

So,

[(110 -235 t)^2]/484 + [14*(1680 t -55)^2]/379456 =5625/224.

Let me find common denominators or try to simplify the equation.

Alternatively, multiply both sides by 379456*484*224 to eliminate denominators. That seems too messy. Maybe factor out some terms.

Alternatively, note that 616=22*28. So 616=22*28.

So 616²= (22²)(28²)=484*784.

So 379456=484*784.

So denominator terms:

First term denominator:484.

Second term denominator:484*784.

So let's factor 484 out.

Multiply equation by 484*784*224 to eliminate denominators.

Wait, let me see:

Equation multiplied by 484*784*224:

Left side:

First term: [(110-235t)^2]/484 *484*784*224= (110-235t)^2 *784*224.

Second term: [14*(1680t-55)^2]/(484*784) *484*784*224=14*(1680t -55)^2 *224.

Right side:5625/224 *484*784*224=5625*484*784.

So now equation is:

(110 -235t)^2 *784*224 +14*(1680t -55)^2 *224 =5625*484*784.

Simplify:

Factor out 224:

224*[ (110 -235t)^2 *784 +14*(1680t -55)^2 ] =5625*484*784.

Divide both sides by 224:

(110 -235t)^2 *784 +14*(1680t -55)^2 = (5625*484*784)/224.

Compute (5625*484*784)/224:

First, simplify 784/224= 3.5. Because 224*3=672, 224*3.5=784. So 784/224=3.5=7/2.

So,

5625 *484 *784 /224=5625*484*(784/224)=5625*484*(3.5)=5625*484*(7/2).

Compute 5625*(7/2)= (5625*7)/2=39375/2.

So,

(110 -235t)^2 *784 +14*(1680t -55)^2 = (39375/2)*484.

Now, compute (39375/2)*484:

39375/2 *484= (39375 *484)/2.

Compute 39375*484:

Well, 39375= 39375= 40000 -625=40000 -625.

But perhaps 39375= 39375= 39375.

Let me compute 39375 *484:

First, compute 39375 *484.

But maybe it's better to note that 39375= 75^2 * 15? Not sure.

Alternatively, compute 39375 *484= 39375*(400+80+4)=39375*400 +39375*80 +39375*4.

Compute each term:

39375 *400= 15,750,000.

39375 *80=3,150,000.

39375 *4=157,500.

Sum:15,750,000 +3,150,000=18,900,000 +157,500=19,057,500.

So,

(39375/2)*484=19,057,500 /2=9,528,750.

So now, the equation is:

(110 -235t)^2 *784 +14*(1680t -55)^2 =9,528,750.

Now, let me expand (110 -235t)^2 and (1680t -55)^2.

First, expand (110 -235t)^2:

=110² - 2*110*235 t + (235t)^2=12100 -51,700t +55,225t².

Multiply by 784:

=12100*784 -51,700*784 t +55,225*784 t².

Compute each term:

12100 *784: Let me compute 12100 *700=8,470,000; 12100*84=1,016,400. So total 8,470,000 +1,016,400=9,486,400.

-51,700*784: 51,700 *700=36,190,000; 51,700 *84=4,342,800. So total 36,190,000 +4,342,800=40,532,800. So with negative sign: -40,532,800.

55,225 *784: Let's compute 55,225 *700=38,657,500; 55,225*84=4,643, 100. Wait, 55,225*80=4,418,000; 55,225*4=220,900. So 4,418,000 +220,900=4,638,900. So total 38,657,500 +4,638,900=43,296,400.

So the first part is:

9,486,400 -40,532,800 t +43,296,400 t².

Now, expand the second term:14*(1680t -55)^2.

First compute (1680t -55)^2= (1680t)^2 -2*1680t*55 +55²= 2,822,400 t² -184,800 t +3,025.

Multiply by 14:

14*2,822,400 t²=39,513,600 t².

14*(-184,800 t)= -2,587,200 t.

14*3025=42,350.

So the second term is:

39,513,600 t² -2,587,200 t +42,350.

Now, add both parts:

First part: 9,486,400 -40,532,800 t +43,296,400 t².

Second part: +39,513,600 t² -2,587,200 t +42,350.

Sum:

t² term:43,296,400 +39,513,600=82,810,000.

t term: -40,532,800 -2,587,200= -43,120,000.

Constants:9,486,400 +42,350=9,528,750.

So equation becomes:

82,810,000 t² -43,120,000 t +9,528,750 =9,528,750.

Subtract 9,528,750 from both sides:

82,810,000 t² -43,120,000 t=0.

Factor out t:

t*(82,810,000 t -43,120,000)=0.

Solutions: t=0, which is point A, and t=43,120,000 /82,810,000.

Simplify the fraction:

43,120,000 /82,810,000 =4312/8281.

Wait, let's see:

Divide numerator and denominator by 100,000: 431200/828100.

Wait, 43120 and 82810. Wait, 43120 ÷10=4312, 82810 ÷10=8281.

So 4312/8281.

Check if 4312 and 8281 have common factors.

Compute GCD(4312,8281):

Divide 8281 by 4312: 8281=4312*1 + 3969.

Now GCD(4312,3969).

4312=3969*1 +343.

GCD(3969,343).

3969 ÷343=11*343=3773, remainder 3969-3773=196.

GCD(343,196).

343 ÷196=1, remainder 147.

GCD(196,147).

196 ÷147=1, remainder49.

GCD(147,49)=49.

So GCD is 49.

So 4312 ÷49= 4312 /49= 88.

8281 ÷49= 8281/49= 169.

So t=88/169.

So t=88/169.

So the parameter t=88/169. Now, find point P.

Recall parametric equations:

x=10 - (235/22)t.

y= (30√14/11)t.

So plug t=88/169.

Compute x:

10 - (235/22)*(88/169).

235/22 *88/169= (235*88)/(22*169).

Simplify 88/22=4, so (235*4)/169=940/169.

So x=10 -940/169= (1690 -940)/169=750/169.

Similarly, y= (30√14/11)*(88/169).

Compute 30/11 *88=30*8=240.

So y=240√14 /169.

So point P is at (750/169,240√14 /169).

Now, need to find AP.

Points A(10,0) and P(750/169,240√14 /169).

Compute distance AP.

AP = sqrt[ (750/169 -10)^2 + (240√14/169 -0)^2 ].

Compute 750/169 -10=750/169 -1690/169= (750 -1690)/169= (-940)/169.

So,

AP= sqrt[ ( (-940/169)^2 ) + (240√14 /169)^2 ].

Factor out 1/169^2:

= sqrt[ (940² + (240√14 )² ) /169² ]= sqrt[ (940² +240²*14 ) ] /169.

Compute numerator:

940²= 883,600.

240²=57,600. 57,600*14=806,400.

So total=883,600 +806,400=1,690,000.

sqrt(1,690,000)=1300.

So AP=1300 /169.

Simplify 1300 /169: 1300 ÷13=100, 169 ÷13=13. So 1300/169=100/13.

Wait, 13*100=1300, and 13*13=169.

So AP=100/13.

Therefore, AP=100/13, so m=100, n=13, m +n=113.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To find the length of \( AP \) in triangle \( ABC \) with given sides \( AB = 5 \), \( BC = 9 \), and \( AC = 10 \), we use coordinate geometry and properties of circles and tangents.

1. **Coordinates of Points**:
   - Place \( C \) at the origin \((0,0)\) and \( A \) at \((10,0)\).
   - Find coordinates of \( B \) using the distance formula:
     \[
     B\left(\frac{39}{5}, \frac{6\sqrt{14}}{5}\right)
     \]

2. **Circumcenter \( O \)**:
   - Calculate the circumcenter \( O \) of \( \triangle ABC \):
     \[
     O\left(5, \frac{5\sqrt{14}}{56}\right)
     \]

3. **Equations of Tangents**:
   - Tangent at \( C \): \( y = -4\sqrt{14}x \)
   - Tangent at \( B \): \( y = \frac{-56\sqrt{14}}{311}(x - \frac{39}{5}) + \frac{6\sqrt{14}}{5} \)

4. **Intersection Point \( D \)**:
   - Solve the equations of the tangents to find \( D \):
     \[
     D\left(-\frac{15}{22}, \frac{30\sqrt{14}}{11}\right)
     \]

5. **Parametric Equation of Line \( AD \)**:
   - Parametric equations for line \( AD \):
     \[
     x(t) = 10 - \frac{235}{22}t, \quad y(t) = \frac{30\sqrt{14}}{11}t
     \]

6. **Intersection with Circumcircle**:
   - Substitute parametric equations into the circumcircle equation and solve for \( t \). The non-zero solution is \( t = \frac{88}{169} \).

7. **Coordinates of Point \( P \)**:
   - Using \( t = \frac{88}{169} \), find \( P \):
     \[
     P\left(\frac{750}{169}, \frac{240\sqrt{14}}{169}\right)
     \]

8. **Distance \( AP \)**:
   - Calculate the distance between \( A(10,0) \) and \( P \):
     \[
     AP = \sqrt{\left(\frac{750}{169} - 10\right)^2 + \left(\frac{240\sqrt{14}}{169}\right)^2} = \frac{100}{13}
     \]

Thus, \( AP = \frac{100}{13} \), and \( m + n = 100 + 13 = 113 \).

\boxed{113}
