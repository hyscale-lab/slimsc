Okay, I'm trying to solve this problem where I have to find the radius squared of the smallest sphere that can contain any rectangular box from the set B. The set B consists of boxes with a surface area of 54 and a volume of 23. The answer needs to be expressed as a fraction p/q where p and q are coprime, and then I have to find p + q.

First, I need to understand the problem. We're dealing with rectangular boxes, so they have length, width, and height, let's say x, y, z respectively. The surface area is given as 54, so the formula for the surface area of a rectangular box is 2(xy + yz + xz) = 54. The volume is xyz = 23.

We need to find the smallest sphere that can contain any such box. The sphere must enclose the box completely. The radius of the smallest such sphere would be half the space diagonal of the box because the space diagonal is the longest distance between any two opposite corners of the box. Therefore, the radius r is half of that diagonal.

The space diagonal d of a box with sides x, y, z is given by the formula d = sqrt(x² + y² + z²). So, r = d/2 = sqrt(x² + y² + z²)/2. Then, r² would be (x² + y² + z²)/4.

So, our goal is to find the maximum possible value of (x² + y² + z²) given the constraints on surface area and volume. Because we need the smallest sphere that can contain any box in B, we need the maximum possible space diagonal squared over all such boxes, which will give us the minimal r².

Wait, no, hold on. Actually, the sphere must contain all boxes in B, so we need the maximum value of the space diagonal across all boxes in B, which would be the minimal sphere that can contain any such box. So, yes, we have to find the maximum of (x² + y² + z²) given the constraints 2(xy + yz + xz) = 54 and xyz = 23. Then, r² is (max (x² + y² + z²))/4.

So, how can I find the maximum of x² + y² + z² given these constraints?

I think I can use methods from optimization with constraints. Maybe using Lagrange multipliers. Alternatively, maybe express variables in terms of others using the given equations.

Let me think. Let me denote S = x + y + z, P = xy + yz + xz, and Q = xyz. We know that P = 27 because 2P = 54, so P = 27. And Q = 23.

We need to find x² + y² + z², which is equal to (x + y + z)² - 2(xy + yz + xz) = S² - 2P. Since P is 27, it's S² - 54.

So, x² + y² + z² = S² - 54.

Therefore, to maximize x² + y² + z², we need to maximize S². So, the problem reduces to finding the maximum possible value of S, given that P = 27 and Q = 23.

So, how can I find the maximum possible value of S?

I know that for positive real numbers x, y, z, the relationship between S, P, and Q is given by the inequalities of symmetric functions. Also, maybe using AM ≥ GM or other inequalities.

Alternatively, perhaps I can express this as a system of equations and use substitution.

Wait, let me consider that x, y, z are positive real numbers. Let me assume that x ≤ y ≤ z. So, perhaps setting x = a, y = a, z = b. Maybe not, but perhaps it's better to consider symmetry.

Wait, actually, without loss of generality, perhaps the maximum of S occurs when two variables are equal. So, maybe setting x = y, and then solving for z. Let's try that.

Let me set x = y. Then, we can express z in terms of x.

So, if x = y, then the volume equation is x² z = 23, so z = 23/(x²).

The surface area equation is 2(xy + yz + xz) = 54. Since x = y, this becomes 2(x² + x z + x z) = 54. Simplify:

2(x² + 2x z) = 54 → x² + 2x z = 27.

Substitute z = 23/(x²):

x² + 2x*(23/(x²)) = 27 → x² + (46/x) = 27.

Multiply both sides by x to eliminate denominator:

x^3 + 46 = 27x → x^3 - 27x + 46 = 0.

So, we have the equation x^3 -27x +46 = 0. Let's try to find its roots.

First, let's check for rational roots using Rational Root Theorem. The possible roots are factors of 46 over factors of 1, so ±1, ±2, ±23, ±46.

Testing x = 1: 1 -27 +46 = 20 ≠ 0.

x = 2: 8 -54 +46 = 0. Yes, x = 2 is a root.

So, we can factor the polynomial as (x - 2)(x² + 2x -23) = 0.

Thus, x = 2 is a real root, and the quadratic equation x² + 2x -23 = 0 has roots at x = [-2 ± sqrt(4 +92)]/2 = [-2 ± sqrt(96)]/2 = [-2 ± 4*sqrt(6)]/2 = -1 ± 2*sqrt(6).

Therefore, the real roots are x = 2 and x = -1 + 2√6 ≈ 3.45, and x = -1 - 2√6 (negative, so discard since x must be positive).

So, possible x values are x = 2 and x = -1 + 2√6 ≈ 3.45.

Wait, but when x = 2, then z = 23/(2)^2 = 23/4 = 5.75.

So, the box would have sides 2, 2, 5.75.

But when x = -1 + 2√6, approximately 3.45, then z = 23/(x²). Let's compute x²:

x = -1 + 2√6, so x² = [(-1) + 2√6]^2 = 1 -4√6 + (2√6)^2 = 1 -4√6 + 24 = 25 -4√6.

So, z = 23 / (25 -4√6). Let's rationalize the denominator:

Multiply numerator and denominator by (25 +4√6):

z = [23*(25 +4√6)] / [ (25)^2 - (4√6)^2 ] = [23*(25 +4√6)] / [625 - 16*6] = [23*(25 +4√6)] / [625 - 96] = [23*(25 +4√6)] / 529.

Simplify: 23 and 529: 529 is 23^2, so [23*(25 +4√6)]/(23^2) = (25 +4√6)/23.

So, z = (25 +4√6)/23 ≈ (25 + 9.798)/23 ≈ 34.798 /23 ≈ 1.513.

Wait, but x was approximately 3.45, which is bigger than z ≈1.513. But earlier, I assumed x = y, but now z is smaller. That contradicts my assumption that x ≤ y ≤ z.

So, perhaps when x = -1 + 2√6 ≈3.45, then z ≈1.513, which is smaller than x. So, in reality, the sides would be z ≈1.513, x ≈3.45, but that would mean that the ordering is z ≤ x ≤ y if x = y. Wait, but in reality, x = y, so if z is smaller, the box's dimensions would be z, x, y where z < x = y. So, that's a different box compared to when x = y =2 and z=5.75.

So, in both cases, we have two possible boxes when assuming two sides are equal. Now, which one gives a larger x² + y² + z²?

In the first case, with x = y =2 and z=5.75, x² + y² + z² = 4 +4 + (5.75)^2 = 8 + 33.0625 =41.0625.

In the second case, x = y ≈3.45, z≈1.513. Then, x² + y² + z² ≈ (3.45)^2 + (3.45)^2 + (1.513)^2 ≈11.90 +11.90 +2.29 ≈26.09.

So, the first case gives a larger sum of squares. So, the maximum occurs when x = y =2, z=5.75.

Wait, but that's under the assumption that two variables are equal. Maybe there's a box where all variables are unequal that gives a larger sum of squares.

Alternatively, perhaps the maximum occurs when two variables are equal, so that case gives the maximum. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps we can use the method of Lagrange multipliers. Let's try that.

We need to maximize f(x, y, z) = x² + y² + z².

Subject to the constraints:

g(x, y, z) = 2(xy + yz + xz) = 54,

h(x, y, z) = xyz =23.

So, we can set up the Lagrangian:

L = x² + y² + z² - λ(2(xy + yz + xz) -54) - μ(xyz -23).

Then, take partial derivatives with respect to x, y, z, set them equal to zero.

Compute ∂L/∂x = 2x - λ(2(y + z)) - μ(yz) =0.

Similarly,

∂L/∂y = 2y - λ(2(x + z)) - μ(xz)=0,

∂L/∂z = 2z - λ(2(x + y)) - μ(xy)=0.

So, we have the system:

2x - 2λ(y + z) - μ yz =0,

2y - 2λ(x + z) - μ xz =0,

2z - 2λ(x + y) - μ xy =0.

Hmm, this seems a bit complicated, but perhaps we can find a relationship between x, y, z.

Let me subtract the first equation from the second equation:

[2y - 2λ(x + z) - μ xz] - [2x - 2λ(y + z) - μ yz] =0.

Simplify:

2(y -x ) -2λ(x + z - y - z) - μ(xz - yz) =0.

Simplify terms:

2(y -x) -2λ(x - y) - μ z(x - y) =0.

Factor out (y - x) = -(x - y):

2(y -x) + 2λ(x - y) + μ z (x - y)=0.

Factor:

(y -x)(2 -2λ - μ z )=0.

So, either y =x, or 2 -2λ - μ z=0.

Similarly, if we subtract the first equation from the third equation:

[2z - 2λ(x + y) - μ xy] - [2x - 2λ(y + z) - μ yz] =0.

Simplify:

2(z -x) -2λ(x + y - y - z) - μ (xy - yz )=0.

Simplify:

2(z -x) -2λ(x - z) - μ y (x - z) =0.

Factor out (z -x) = -(x - z):

2(z -x) + 2λ(x - z) + μ y (x -z )=0.

Factor:

(z -x)(2 +2λ + μ y )=0.

So, either z =x, or 2 +2λ + μ y =0.

Similarly, subtracting the second equation from the third equation would give us a similar result.

So, from these results, either variables are equal, or certain terms involving λ and μ are zero.

If we suppose that two variables are equal, say x = y, then we can proceed as before.

Alternatively, if all variables are equal, but in that case, the box would be a cube. Let me check if a cube is possible.

If x = y = z, then surface area is 6x² =54 →x²=9→x=3. Volume would be 27, which is larger than 23, so it's not possible. Therefore, the box cannot be a cube, so variables are not all equal.

So, perhaps the maximum occurs when two variables are equal. So, earlier when I set x = y, got two possible solutions, and the first one gave a larger x² + y² + z².

But I need to confirm whether this is indeed the maximum.

Alternatively, perhaps I can parameterize the variables. Let me try to express variables in terms of each other.

From the volume constraint: xyz=23.

Let me express z =23/(xy).

Then, substitute into the surface area equation:

2(xy + y*(23/(xy)) + x*(23/(xy))) =54.

Simplify:

2[ xy + (23)/(x) + (23)/(y) ] =54.

Divide both sides by 2:

xy + (23/x) + (23/y) =27.

Let me denote u = x + y, v = xy. Then, we have:

v + 23/x + 23/y =27.

But 23/x +23/y =23*(1/x +1/y) =23*(y +x)/(xy) =23*(u)/(v).

So, equation becomes:

v + (23 u)/v =27.

Multiply both sides by v:

v² +23 u =27 v.

So, v² -27 v +23 u =0.

But u =x + y, and v=xy. So, we have a relationship between u and v.

But I also know that x and y are positive real numbers, so u ≥ 2√v by AM ≥ GM.

So, u ≥ 2√v.

Let me see if I can express u in terms of v. From the equation:

v² -27 v +23 u =0 → 23 u =27 v -v² → u= (27v -v²)/23.

But u ≥2√v, so:

(27v -v²)/23 ≥ 2√v.

Multiply both sides by 23:

27v -v² ≥46√v.

Let me set t =√v. Then, v =t².

So, 27 t² -t^4 ≥46 t.

Rearrange:

-t^4 +27 t² -46 t ≥0.

Multiply both sides by -1 (inequality sign reverses):

t^4 -27 t² +46 t ≤0.

We need to find t >0 such that t^4 -27 t² +46 t ≤0.

Hmm, this seems complex. Maybe we can factor or find roots.

Alternatively, perhaps we can consider specific values of t to see where the inequality holds.

Let me try t=2.

t=2: 16 - 27*4 +46*2 =16 -108 +92= (16 +92) -108= 108 -108=0. So, t=2 is a root.

Similarly, we can factor out (t-2). Let's perform polynomial division.

Divide t^4 -27 t² +46 t by (t-2).

Using synthetic division:

Coefficients: 1 (t^4), 0 (t^3), -27 (t^2), 46 (t), 0 (constant).

Wait, but t=2 is a root, so divide t^4 -27 t² +46 t -0 by (t-2).

Set up synthetic division:

2 | 1  0  -27  46  0

Bring down 1.

Multiply 1*2=2, add to next coefficient: 0+2=2.

Multiply 2*2=4, add to -27: -23.

Multiply -23*2=-46, add to 46: 0.

Multiply 0*2=0, add to 0:0.

So, the polynomial factors as (t -2)(t^3 +2 t^2 -23 t).

So, t^4 -27 t² +46 t = (t -2)(t^3 +2 t^2 -23 t).

Factor further:

t^3 +2 t^2 -23 t = t(t^2 +2 t -23).

So, the polynomial is (t-2) t (t^2 +2 t -23).

Set equal to zero: (t-2) t (t^2 +2 t -23)=0.

Solutions are t=0, t=2, and t^2 +2 t -23=0.

Solving t^2 +2 t -23=0, t = [-2 ± sqrt(4 +92)]/2 = [-2 ± sqrt(96)]/2 = [-2 ±4√6]/2 = -1 ±2√6.

So, positive roots are t=2 and t=-1 +2√6 ≈3.45.

So, the inequality t^4 -27 t² +46 t ≤0 is satisfied between the roots.

The roots are t=0, t=2, and t≈3.45.

So, the sign of the polynomial:

- For t <0, test t=-1: positive (since even powers dominate).

Between t=0 and t=2:

Let me choose t=1: 1 -27 +46=20>0.

Between t=2 and t≈3.45: Let's pick t=3:

3^4=81, 27*9=243, 46*3=138.

So, 81 -243 +138= (81+138) -243=219-243=-24 <0.

For t >3.45: Let's pick t=4:

256 -27*16 +46*4=256 -432 +184= (256+184) -432=440-432=8>0.

So, the polynomial is ≤0 in [0,2] and [2,3.45]. Wait, no, the polynomial is t^4 -27 t² +46 t, which is ≤0 in the intervals where it's negative or zero.

From the analysis:

- For t <0: positive.

- 0 <t <2: positive.

- 2 < t <3.45: negative.

- t>3.45: positive.

So, the inequality t^4 -27 t² +46 t ≤0 is satisfied when 2 ≤t ≤ (-1 +2√6)≈3.45.

So, t is between 2 and≈3.45.

Thus, u= (27v -v²)/23, and v= t².

So, t is between 2 and≈3.45, so v= t² is between 4 and≈11.90.

So, let's see, when t=2, v=4.

Then, u= (27*4 -4²)/23= (108 -16)/23=92/23≈4.

Similarly, when t≈3.45, v≈11.90, and u≈(27*11.90 - (11.90)^2)/23.

Compute numerator: 27*11.90≈321.3, 11.90^2≈141.61, so 321.3 -141.61≈179.69.

So, u≈179.69/23≈7.81.

So, u ranges from 4 to≈7.81.

Wait, but u is x + y, and v=xy.

We can use these expressions to find x and y.

We have u = x + y and v=xy.

So, the quadratic equation would be s² - u s + v=0, where s is x or y.

So, if we have u and v, we can find x and y.

But perhaps this isn't directly helpful. Alternatively, maybe we can express x² + y² + z² in terms of u and v.

Wait, earlier, we had x² + y² + z² = S² -54, where S =x + y + z.

But S = u + z.

And z =23/(xy)=23/v.

So, S = u + 23/v.

So, x² + y² + z² = (u + 23/v)^2 -54.

But u is related to v by u = (27v -v²)/23.

So, substitute u into the expression:

x² + y² + z² = [ (27v -v²)/23 + 23/v ]^2 -54.

Simplify the expression inside the square:

Let me compute A = (27v -v²)/23 +23/v.

Combine terms:

A = [ (27v -v²) *v + 23*23 ] / (23v )

Wait, no, wait:

Wait, (27v -v²)/23 +23/v = [ (27v -v²) *v + 23*23 ] / (23v )

Wait, no, actually, to add the two terms, they need a common denominator.

The first term is (27v -v²)/23, the second is 23/v.

So, common denominator is 23v.

So, A = [ (27v -v²) *v + 23*23 ] / (23v )

= [27v² -v^3 + 529 ] / (23v )

So, A = ( -v^3 +27v² +529 ) / (23v )

Thus, x² + y² + z² = [ ( -v^3 +27v² +529 ) / (23v ) ]² -54.

This looks complicated, but perhaps we can find the maximum by taking the derivative with respect to v and setting it to zero.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to proceed numerically or see if the maximum occurs at one of the endpoints.

Earlier, when we set x=y=2, then v =x y=4, and u =x + y=4.

So, z=23/v=23/4=5.75.

So, S = u + z =4 +5.75=9.75.

x² + y² + z² = (9.75)^2 -54=95.0625 -54=41.0625.

In the other case, when t≈3.45, v≈11.90, u≈7.81.

So, z=23/v≈23/11.90≈1.932.

Then, S =u + z≈7.81 +1.932≈9.742.

So, x² + y² + z² = (9.742)^2 -54≈94.92 -54≈40.92.

Which is slightly less than 41.0625.

Wait, but that contradicts the earlier computation where x = y ≈3.45, z≈1.513, giving a sum of squares≈26.09. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the earlier substitution.

Wait, perhaps I need to re-examine.

Earlier, when I set x = y, I found that x^3 -27x +46 =0, which had roots x=2 and x=-1 +2√6≈3.45.

So, when x=2, y=2, z=23/(2*2)=23/4=5.75.

Sum of squares: 4 +4 + (5.75)^2=8 +33.0625=41.0625.

When x= -1 +2√6≈3.45, z=23/(x^2)=23/( (-1 +2√6)^2 ).

Compute denominator:

(-1 +2√6)^2=1 -4√6 + (2√6)^2=1 -4√6 +24=25 -4√6.

So, z=23/(25 -4√6).

Rationalizing:

Multiply numerator and denominator by (25 +4√6):

z= [23*(25 +4√6)] / [ (25)^2 - (4√6)^2 ] = [23*(25 +4√6)]/(625 -96)= [23*(25 +4√6)]/529.

Since 529=23^2, this simplifies to (25 +4√6)/23≈ (25 +9.798)/23≈34.798/23≈1.513.

So, in this case, x=y≈3.45, z≈1.513.

Then, sum of squares: (3.45)^2 + (3.45)^2 + (1.513)^2≈11.90 +11.90 +2.29≈26.09.

Wait, that's a lot less than 41.0625. So, why did the earlier substitution when assuming x = y give me a lower sum of squares?

Ah, perhaps because when x=y=3.45, z=1.513, the sum of squares is lower, but when x=y=2, z=5.75, the sum is higher.

Therefore, the maximum sum of squares occurs when x=y=2, z=5.75, giving x² + y² + z²=41.0625.

So, then, the radius squared is (41.0625)/4=10.265625.

But wait, 41.0625 is equal to 41 + 1/16, since 0.0625=1/16. So, 41.0625=657/16.

Wait, 41 *16=656, plus 1 is 657. So, 657/16.

Then, r²= (657/16)/4=657/(16*4)=657/64.

Wait, 657 divided by 64 is 10.265625, as before.

So, 657 and 64: are they coprime? Let's check.

64=2^6.

657: 6+5+7=18, so divisible by 9. 657 ÷9=73. So, 657=9*73.

73 is a prime number.

64 and 657 share no common factors, since 657 is 9*73 and 64 is 2^6. So, yes, 657/64 is reduced.

Therefore, p=657, q=64, so p+q=657 +64=721.

Wait, but earlier I thought S was 9.75, and x² + y² +z²= (9.75)^2 -54=95.0625 -54=41.0625, which is 657/16. Then, r²=657/(16*4)=657/64.

But wait, let me compute 9.75 squared: 9.75^2 = (39/4)^2=1521/16=95.0625. Then, subtract 54: 95.0625 -54=41.0625=657/16.

Yes, so x² + y² +z²=657/16, so r²=657/(16*4)=657/64.

Therefore, the answer is 657 +64=721.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To solve the problem, we need to find the radius squared of the smallest sphere that can contain any rectangular box from the set $\mathcal{B}$, where each box has a surface area of 54 and a volume of 23. The radius of the sphere is half the space diagonal of the box, so we need to maximize the space diagonal squared, which is $x^2 + y^2 + z^2$ for a box with dimensions $x, y, z$.

Given the constraints:
1. Surface area: $2(xy + yz + xz) = 54 \implies xy + yz + xz = 27$.
2. Volume: $xyz = 23$.

The space diagonal squared is $x^2 + y^2 + z^2$. Using the identity $(x + y + z)^2 = x^2 + y^2 + z^2 + 2(xy + yz + xz)$, we can express $x^2 + y^2 + z^2$ as $(x + y + z)^2 - 54$.

To maximize $x^2 + y^2 + z^2$, we need to maximize $(x + y + z)^2$. We consider the case where two dimensions are equal, $x = y$, and solve for $z$. Substituting $x = y$ into the constraints, we find that $x = 2$, $y = 2$, and $z = 5.75$ satisfy both the surface area and volume conditions. This gives $x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = 4 + 4 + (5.75)^2 = 41.0625$.

Thus, the radius squared of the sphere is $r^2 = \frac{41.0625}{4} = \frac{657}{64}$. The fraction $\frac{657}{64}$ is in simplest form, so $p = 657$ and $q = 64$. Therefore, $p + q = 721$.

The final answer is $\boxed{721}$.
