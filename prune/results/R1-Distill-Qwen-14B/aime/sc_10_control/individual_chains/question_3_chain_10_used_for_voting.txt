Okay, so I need to solve this probability problem. Let me read it again and make sure I understand all parts.

Jen is entering a lottery. She picks 4 distinct numbers from the set S = {1,2,3,...,9,10}. Then, 4 numbers are randomly chosen from S. She wins a prize if at least two of her numbers match two of the randomly chosen numbers. She wins the grand prize if all four of her numbers are the ones chosen. The question is about the probability of her winning the grand prize given that she won a prize. They mention this probability is m/n, where m and n are coprime, and we need to find m + n.

Hmm. So, it's a conditional probability problem. The formula for conditional probability is P(A|B) = P(A ∩ B) / P(B). But in this case, if she wins the grand prize, she must have won a prize. So, the event of winning the grand prize is a subset of winning a prize. Therefore, P(A ∩ B) is just P(A). So, the probability we're looking for is P(grand prize) / P(prize).

So, I need to find the probability of winning the grand prize divided by the probability of winning a prize.

First, let me figure out the total number of possible ways the lottery can be run. Since the lottery picks 4 numbers from 10, the total number of possible combinations is C(10,4). Let me compute that: C(10,4) = 10! / (4! * (10-4)!) = (10*9*8*7)/(4*3*2*1) = 210.

So, there are 210 possible sets of 4 numbers that could be chosen.

Jen picks 4 distinct numbers, so there's only one specific combination she has. Let's denote her chosen numbers as J. The randomly chosen numbers from the lottery can be thought of as a random set L.

She wins a prize if L and J share at least two numbers. That is, the intersection of L and J has size ≥ 2. She wins the grand prize if L and J are exactly the same, so the intersection has size 4.

So, to compute P(grand prize), that's straightforward. The probability that L is exactly J is 1/C(10,4) because there's only one favorable outcome. So, P(grand prize) = 1/210.

Now, I need to compute P(prize), which is the probability that L and J share at least two numbers. That is, |L ∩ J| ≥ 2. So, this can be calculated by summing the probabilities that L and J share exactly 2, 3, or 4 numbers.

Alternatively, it's easier to compute 1 minus the probability that L and J share fewer than two numbers. That is, P(prize) = 1 - P(|L ∩ J| < 2). So, P(prize) = 1 - P(|L ∩ J| = 0) - P(|L ∩ J| = 1).

Let me compute P(|L ∩ J| = k) for k=0,1,2,3,4.

In general, the number of ways to choose a set L of 4 numbers that intersects J in exactly k numbers is C(4,k) * C(6,4 - k). Because we choose k numbers from J (which has 4) and 4 - k numbers from the remaining 6 numbers not in J.

So, the number of favorable outcomes for exactly k matches is C(4,k) * C(6,4 - k).

Therefore, the total number of such sets is C(4,k)*C(6,4 -k). So, the probability of exactly k matches is [C(4,k)*C(6,4 -k)] / C(10,4).

So, let's compute for k=0,1,2,3,4.

For k=0: C(4,0)*C(6,4) = 1 * 15 = 15.

For k=1: C(4,1)*C(6,3) = 4 * 20 = 80.

For k=2: C(4,2)*C(6,2) = 6 * 15 = 90.

For k=3: C(4,3)*C(6,1) = 4 * 6 = 24.

For k=4: C(4,4)*C(6,0) = 1 * 1 = 1.

Let me check if these all add up to 210.

15 + 80 = 95; 95 + 90 = 185; 185 +24=209; 209 +1=210. Yep, that adds up.

So, the number of ways to have exactly 0 matches is 15, exactly 1 is 80, exactly 2 is 90, exactly 3 is 24, exactly 4 is 1.

Therefore, the probability of exactly 2 matches is 90/210, exactly 3 is 24/210, exactly 4 is 1/210.

So, P(prize) is the sum of probabilities for k=2,3,4. Which is (90 +24 +1)/210 = 115/210. Simplify that: 115 and 210 are both divisible by 5. 115 ÷5=23, 210 ÷5=42. So, 23/42.

Alternatively, using the complementary probability: 1 - [P(k=0) + P(k=1)] = 1 - [15 +80]/210 = 1 -95/210= (210 -95)/210=115/210=23/42.

So, P(prize) =23/42.

P(grand prize) is 1/210, as calculated before.

Therefore, the conditional probability P(grand prize | prize) is (1/210)/(23/42) = (1/210)*(42/23)= (42)/(210*23).

Simplify 42/210: 42 ÷42=1, 210 ÷42=5. So, 1/5.

Thus, (1/5)/23 = 1/(5*23)=1/115.

Wait, no. Let me do it step by step.

(1/210) divided by (23/42) is equal to (1/210) multiplied by (42/23).

So, 42 divided by 210 is 42/210 = 1/5.

So, (1/210)*(42/23)= (1/5)*(1/23)=1/115.

So, the probability is 1/115. Therefore, m=1 and n=115. Are they coprime? 1 and 115 share no common divisors besides 1, so yes.

So, m +n=1+115=116.

Wait, but let me think again. Am I sure about the calculations?

Wait, 42/210 is indeed 1/5. So, 1/210 *42/23 = (42)/(210*23) = 1/(5*23)=1/115.

Yes, that's correct.

Alternatively, another way to think about it: given that she won a prize, the probability that it was the grand prize.

Which is the same as, given that |L ∩ J| ≥2, what's the probability |L ∩ J|=4.

So, in other words, the probability mass function at 4, given that k is at least 2.

Which is P(k=4) / P(k≥2) = (1/210)/(115/210)=1/115.

So, same result.

Okay, so I think the answer is 1/115, so m +n=1+115=116.

The probability of Jen winning the grand prize given that she won a prize is \(\frac{1}{115}\). Therefore, \(m = 1\) and \(n = 115\), and \(m + n = 116\).

\boxed{116}
