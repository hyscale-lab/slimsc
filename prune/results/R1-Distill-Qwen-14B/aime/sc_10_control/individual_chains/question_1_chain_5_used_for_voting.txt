Okay, so I've got this problem here with logarithms and variables x, y, and z. Hmm, let me see. The equations are:

1. log₂(x/(y z)) = 1/2
2. log₂(y/(x z)) = 1/3
3. log₂(z/(x y)) = 1/4

And we need to find the absolute value of log₂(x⁴ y³ z²), which will be a fraction m/n, and then find m + n.

First, I remember that log₂(a/b) = log₂ a - log₂ b. So maybe I can rewrite each equation using that property.

Starting with the first equation:
log₂(x) - log₂(y) - log₂(z) = 1/2.

Similarly, the second equation:
log₂(y) - log₂(x) - log₂(z) = 1/3.

And the third equation:
log₂(z) - log₂(x) - log₂(y) = 1/4.

Hmm, interesting. So if I let a = log₂(x), b = log₂(y), and c = log₂(z), then the equations become:

1. a - b - c = 1/2
2. -a + b - c = 1/3
3. -a - b + c = 1/4

Now I have a system of three linear equations with three variables a, b, c. I can try solving this system.

Let me write them again:

1. a - b - c = 1/2
2. -a + b - c = 1/3
3. -a - b + c = 1/4

I think I'll add all three equations together to see if that helps. Adding equation 1, 2, and 3:

(a - b - c) + (-a + b - c) + (-a - b + c) = 1/2 + 1/3 + 1/4

Let me compute the left side:

a - b - c - a + b - c - a - b + c = combine like terms.

a - a - a = -a.

-b + b - b = -b.

-c - c + c = -c.

So altogether: -a - b - c = 1/2 + 1/3 + 1/4.

Wait, but on the right side, let's compute the sum:

1/2 is 6/12, 1/3 is 4/12, 1/4 is 3/12. So 6 + 4 + 3 = 13, so 13/12.

So, -a - b - c = 13/12.

But that's interesting. Now, if I can find a, b, c individually, then I can compute log₂(x⁴ y³ z²) as 4a + 3b + 2c.

Wait, let me make sure. Because x⁴ y³ z² would have exponents 4,3,2 on x,y,z, so log₂(x⁴ y³ z²) = log₂(x⁴) + log₂(y³) + log₂(z²) = 4 log₂x + 3 log₂y + 2 log₂z = 4a + 3b + 2c.

So we need to find 4a + 3b + 2c in absolute value.

But first, let's solve for a, b, c.

We have:

Equation 1: a - b - c = 1/2

Equation 2: -a + b - c = 1/3

Equation 3: -a - b + c = 1/4

And from adding all three, we have:

-a - b - c = 13/12 --> Equation 4.

So, equation 4: -a - b - c = 13/12.

Now, let's see if we can express other equations in terms of equation 4.

Looking back to equation 1: a - b - c = 1/2.

If I add equation 1 and equation 4:

(a - b - c) + (-a - b - c) = 1/2 + 13/12.

Simplify left side:

a -a cancels. Then -b - b = -2b. -c -c = -2c.

So left side: -2b -2c = (1/2 + 13/12).

Convert 1/2 to 6/12, so 6/12 +13/12=19/12.

So: -2b -2c = 19/12.

Divide both sides by -2:

b + c = -19/24 --> Equation 5.

Similarly, let's take equation 2: -a + b - c = 1/3.

Add equation 2 and equation 4:

(-a + b - c) + (-a - b - c) = 1/3 + 13/12.

Left side:

- a -a = -2a.

b - b = 0.

- c - c = -2c.

So left side: -2a -2c = 1/3 +13/12.

Convert 1/3 to 4/12, so 4/12 +13/12=17/12.

Thus: -2a -2c = 17/12.

Divide both sides by -2:

a + c = -17/24 --> Equation 6.

Similarly, take equation 3: -a - b + c =1/4.

Add equation 3 and equation4:

(-a - b + c) + (-a - b -c) =1/4 +13/12.

Left side:

- a -a = -2a.

- b -b = -2b.

c - c = 0.

So: -2a -2b = (3/12 +13/12)=16/12=4/3.

Divide both sides by -2:

a + b = -4/3 / 2 = -2/3 --> equation 7.

Now, so far, equations 5,6,7.

Equation5: b + c = -19/24.

Equation6: a + c = -17/24.

Equation7: a + b = -2/3.

So, from equation7: a + b = -2/3.

From equation6: a + c = -17/24.

From equation5: b + c = -19/24.

I think we can solve for a, b, c.

Let me write down:

From equation6: a = (-17/24) - c. [expression for a in terms of c].

From equation5: b = (-19/24) - c. [expression for b in terms of c].

Now plug these into equation7:

a + b = (-17/24 -c) + (-19/24 - c) = (-17/24 -19/24) - 2c = (-36/24) -2c = (-3/2) -2c.

But from equation7, a + b = -2/3.

So:

-3/2 -2c = -2/3.

Solve for c:

-2c = -2/3 + 3/2.

Find a common denominator for the right side, which is 6.

-2/3 is -4/6, 3/2 is 9/6.

So: -2c = (-4/6 +9/6)=5/6.

Thus, c = (5/6)/(-2) = -5/(12).

So, c = -5/12.

Now, from equation6: a + c = -17/24.

So a = (-17/24) - c = (-17/24) - (-5/12) = (-17/24) +5/12.

Convert 5/12 to 10/24, so:

a = (-17 +10)/24= (-7)/24.

So a = -7/24.

Similarly, from equation5: b + c = -19/24.

So b = (-19/24) - c = (-19/24) - (-5/12) = (-19/24) +5/12.

Convert 5/12 to 10/24: (-19 +10)/24= (-9)/24= -3/8.

So, b = -3/8.

So, now we have:

a = log₂x = -7/24.

b = log₂y = -3/8.

c = log₂z = -5/12.

Now, we need to compute 4a +3b +2c.

Let me compute each term:

4a =4*(-7/24)= -28/24= -7/6.

3b=3*(-3/8)= -9/8.

2c=2*(-5/12)= -10/12= -5/6.

So adding them all:

-7/6 -9/8 -5/6.

First, find a common denominator. 6,8,6. The least common multiple is 24.

Convert each:

-7/6= -28/24.

-9/8= -27/24.

-5/6= -20/24.

Adding them: (-28 -27 -20)/24= (-75)/24.

Simplify: -75/24. Both divisible by 3: 25/8.

Wait, no, 75 divided by3 is25, 24 divided by3 is8. So, it's -25/8.

So, 4a +3b +2c= -25/8.

But the problem asks for the absolute value of this, so | -25/8 | =25/8.

So the value is 25/8, which is m/n with m=25, n=8. They are coprime.

So m +n=25 +8=33.

**Final Answer**
\boxed{33}

Given the system of equations involving logarithms:

1. \(\log_2\left(\frac{x}{yz}\right) = \frac{1}{2}\)
2. \(\log_2\left(\frac{y}{xz}\right) = \frac{1}{3}\)
3. \(\log_2\left(\frac{z}{xy}\right) = \frac{1}{4}\)

We introduce \(a = \log_2(x)\), \(b = \log_2(y)\), and \(c = \log_2(z)\). This transforms the equations into:

1. \(a - b - c = \frac{1}{2}\)
2. \(-a + b - c = \frac{1}{3}\)
3. \(-a - b + c = \frac{1}{4}\)

Adding all three equations, we get:

\[
(a - b - c) + (-a + b - c) + (-a - b + c) = \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{3} + \frac{1}{4}
\]

Simplifying the left side:

\[
-a - b - c = \frac{6}{12} + \frac{4}{12} + \frac{3}{12} = \frac{13}{12}
\]

Thus, we have:

\[
-a - b - c = \frac{13}{12}
\]

We now solve for \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) using the system of equations. Adding pairs of the original equations and combining with the result above, we find:

1. From \(a - b - c = \frac{1}{2}\) and \(-a - b - c = \frac{13}{12}\), we get:
   \[
   -2b - 2c = \frac{19}{12} \implies b + c = -\frac{19}{24}
   \]

2. From \(-a + b - c = \frac{1}{3}\) and \(-a - b - c = \frac{13}{12}\), we get:
   \[
   -2a - 2c = \frac{17}{12} \implies a + c = -\frac{17}{24}
   \]

3. From \(-a - b + c = \frac{1}{4}\) and \(-a - b - c = \frac{13}{12}\), we get:
   \[
   -2a - 2b = \frac{16}{12} \implies a + b = -\frac{2}{3}
   \]

Solving these, we find:

- \(a = -\frac{7}{24}\)
- \(b = -\frac{3}{8}\)
- \(c = -\frac{5}{12}\)

We need to compute \(4a + 3b + 2c\):

\[
4a = 4 \left(-\frac{7}{24}\right) = -\frac{7}{6}
\]
\[
3b = 3 \left(-\frac{3}{8}\right) = -\frac{9}{8}
\]
\[
2c = 2 \left(-\frac{5}{12}\right) = -\frac{5}{6}
\]

Adding these together:

\[
-\frac{7}{6} - \frac{9}{8} - \frac{5}{6} = -\frac{28}{24} - \frac{27}{24} - \frac{20}{24} = -\frac{75}{24} = -\frac{25}{8}
\]

Taking the absolute value, we get \(\left| -\frac{25}{8} \right| = \frac{25}{8}\). Thus, \(m = 25\) and \(n = 8\), giving \(m + n = 33\).

\[
\boxed{33}
\]
