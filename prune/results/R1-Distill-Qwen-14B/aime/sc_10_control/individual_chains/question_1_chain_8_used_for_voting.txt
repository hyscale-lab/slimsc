Okay, let's try to solve this system of logarithmic equations. So, we have three equations:

1. log₂(x/(yz)) = 1/2
2. log₂(y/(xz)) = 1/3
3. log₂(z/(xy)) = 1/4

And we need to find the absolute value of log₂(x⁴y³z²), which will be a fraction m/n, then find m + n.

Hmm, logarithms can sometimes be tricky, but I remember that log₂(a/b) = log₂ a - log₂ b, so maybe I can rewrite each equation using that property.

Let me write each equation in terms of logs.

Starting with the first equation:

log₂(x) - log₂(y) - log₂(z) = 1/2.

Similarly, the second equation:

log₂(y) - log₂(x) - log₂(z) = 1/3.

And the third equation:

log₂(z) - log₂(x) - log₂(y) = 1/4.

Hmm, okay, so now we have three equations with three variables: log₂(x), log₂(y), log₂(z). Let's assign variables to make it easier. Let me let:

a = log₂(x),
b = log₂(y),
c = log₂(z).

So now the equations become:

1. a - b - c = 1/2
2. -a + b - c = 1/3
3. -a - b + c = 1/4

So now we have a system of three linear equations with three variables a, b, c.

Let me write them again:

1. a - b - c = 1/2
2. -a + b - c = 1/3
3. -a - b + c = 1/4

I need to solve for a, b, c. Let me try to add and subtract these equations to eliminate variables.

Maybe adding equation 1 and equation 2. Let's see:

Equation 1: a - b - c = 1/2
Equation 2: -a + b - c = 1/3
Adding them:
( a - a ) + (-b + b) + (-c - c) = 1/2 + 1/3
Simplifies to:
0 + 0 - 2c = 5/6
So, -2c = 5/6 => c = -5/(6*2) = -5/12.

Wait, c is negative? But z is a positive real number, so log₂(z) could be negative if z is between 0 and 1. Okay, that's fine.

So c = -5/12.

Now, let's try adding another pair. Maybe equation 1 and equation 3.

Equation 1: a - b - c = 1/2
Equation 3: -a - b + c = 1/4
Adding them:
(a - a) + (-b - b) + (-c + c) = 1/2 + 1/4
Which becomes:
0 - 2b + 0 = 3/4
So, -2b = 3/4 => b = -3/(4*2) = -3/8.

Hmm, b is also negative. So log₂(y) is negative, meaning y is less than 1.

Now, we have b = -3/8 and c = -5/12.

Now, let's find a. Let's use equation 1: a - b - c = 1/2

Substituting b and c:

a - (-3/8) - (-5/12) = 1/2

Simplify:

a + 3/8 + 5/12 = 1/2

Let me find a common denominator for the fractions. 8 and 12 have a common denominator of 24.

So, 3/8 = 9/24, 5/12 = 10/24.

Adding them: 9/24 + 10/24 = 19/24.

So, a + 19/24 = 1/2.

1/2 is 12/24, so:

a = 12/24 - 19/24 = (12 - 19)/24 = (-7)/24.

So, a = -7/24.

So now, a = log₂(x) = -7/24,
b = log₂(y) = -3/8,
c = log₂(z) = -5/12.

Double-checking these values with the equations:

Equation 2: -a + b - c = 1/3
Substitute a, b, c:
-(-7/24) + (-3/8) - (-5/12) = 7/24 - 3/8 + 5/12
Convert all to 24 denominator:
7/24 - 9/24 + 10/24 = (7 - 9 + 10)/24 = 8/24 = 1/3. Correct.

Equation 3: -a - b + c = 1/4
Substitute:
-(-7/24) - (-3/8) + (-5/12) = 7/24 + 3/8 - 5/12
Convert to 24:
7/24 + 9/24 - 10/24 = (7 +9 -10)/24 = 6/24 = 1/4. Correct.

Good, so the values are consistent.

Now, we need to compute |log₂(x⁴ y³ z²)|.

Let's express log₂(x⁴ y³ z²) as 4 log₂(x) + 3 log₂(y) + 2 log₂(z). Because log₂(ab) = log₂ a + log₂ b, and the power rule.

So, substituting a, b, c:

4a + 3b + 2c.

Which is:

4*(-7/24) + 3*(-3/8) + 2*(-5/12).

Let me calculate each term:

4*(-7/24) = (-28)/24 = (-7)/6 ≈-1.1667

3*(-3/8) = (-9)/8 ≈-1.125

2*(-5/12) = (-10)/12 = (-5)/6 ≈-0.8333

Now, adding them together:

(-7/6) + (-9/8) + (-5/6).

Let me convert all to 24 denominator:

-7/6 = -28/24,

-9/8 = -27/24,

-5/6 = -20/24.

Adding: (-28 -27 -20)/24 = (-75)/24.

Simplify: -75/24. Let me reduce this fraction.

Divide numerator and denominator by 3: 75 ÷ 3 = 25; 24 ÷3=8. So, -25/8.

So, log₂(x⁴ y³ z²) = -25/8.

But we take the absolute value, so | -25/8 | = 25/8.

So, the value is 25/8. Since 25 and 8 are coprime (no common factors besides 1), m =25, n=8. So m + n = 33.

Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make an arithmetic error in the calculation.

Let me re-calculate 4a + 3b + 2c:

a = -7/24, so 4a = -7/6.

b = -3/8, so 3b = -9/8.

c = -5/12, so 2c = -5/6.

So, sum is (-7/6) + (-9/8) + (-5/6).

Combine the first and third terms: (-7/6 -5/6) = (-12/6) = -2.

Then, -2 + (-9/8) = -(2 + 9/8). 2 is 16/8, so 16/8 +9/8=25/8. So total is -25/8. Absolute value is 25/8. Correct.

So, the answer is 25/8, which is m/n where m=25, n=8. 25 and 8 are coprime, so m +n=33.

We are given a system of logarithmic equations involving positive real numbers \(x\), \(y\), and \(z\):

\[
\begin{cases}
\log_2\left(\dfrac{x}{yz}\right) = \dfrac{1}{2} \\
\log_2\left(\dfrac{y}{xz}\right) = \dfrac{1}{3} \\
\log_2\left(\dfrac{z}{xy}\right) = \dfrac{1}{4}
\end{cases}
\]

We need to find the value of \(\left|\log_2(x^4y^3z^2)\right|\) expressed as \(\dfrac{m}{n}\), where \(m\) and \(n\) are relatively prime positive integers, and compute \(m + n\).

### Step 1: Convert Logarithmic Equations to Linear Form
Using the property \(\log_b\left(\dfrac{a}{c}\right) = \log_b a - \log_b c\), we rewrite each equation:

\[
\begin{cases}
\log_2 x - \log_2 y - \log_2 z = \dfrac{1}{2} \\
-\log_2 x + \log_2 y - \log_2 z = \dfrac{1}{3} \\
-\log_2 x - \log_2 y + \log_2 z = \dfrac{1}{4}
\end{cases}
\]

Let \(a = \log_2 x\), \(b = \log_2 y\), and \(c = \log_2 z\). The system becomes:

\[
\begin{cases}
a - b - c = \dfrac{1}{2} \\
-a + b - c = \dfrac{1}{3} \\
-a - b + c = \dfrac{1}{4}
\end{cases}
\]

### Step 2: Solve the Linear System
Adding the first two equations to eliminate \(a\):

\[
(a - b - c) + (-a + b - c) = \dfrac{1}{2} + \dfrac{1}{3} \\
-2c = \dfrac{5}{6} \implies c = -\dfrac{5}{12}
\]

Adding the first and third equations to eliminate \(a\):

\[
(a - b - c) + (-a - b + c) = \dfrac{1}{2} + \dfrac{1}{4} \\
-2b = \dfrac{3}{4} \implies b = -\dfrac{3}{8}
\]

Substituting \(b\) and \(c\) into the first equation to solve for \(a\):

\[
a - \left(-\dfrac{3}{8}\right) - \left(-\dfrac{5}{12}\right) = \dfrac{1}{2} \\
a + \dfrac{3}{8} + \dfrac{5}{12} = \dfrac{1}{2} 
\]

Converting to a common denominator (24):

\[
a + \dfrac{9}{24} + \dfrac{10}{24} = \dfrac{12}{24} \\
a + \dfrac{19}{24} = \dfrac{12}{24} \implies a = \dfrac{-7}{24}
\]

### Step 3: Compute \(\left|\log_2(x^4y^3z^2)\right|\)
We need to find:

\[
\log_2(x^4y^3z^2) = 4\log_2 x + 3\log_2 y + 2\log_2 z = 4a + 3b + 2c
\]

Substituting \(a = -\dfrac{7}{24}\), \(b = -\dfrac{3}{8}\), and \(c = -\dfrac{5}{12}\):

\[
4\left(-\dfrac{7}{24}\right) + 3\left(-\dfrac{3}{8}\right) + 2\left(-\dfrac{5}{12}\right) = -\dfrac{7}{6} - \dfrac{9}{8} - \dfrac{5}{6}
\]

Converting to a common denominator (24):

\[
-\dfrac{28}{24} - \dfrac{27}{24} - \dfrac{20}{24} = -\dfrac{75}{24} = -\dfrac{25}{8}
\]

Taking the absolute value:

\[
\left|-\dfrac{25}{8}\right| = \dfrac{25}{8}
\]

Thus, \(m = 25\) and \(n = 8\), so \(m + n = 33\).

### Final Answer
\[
\boxed{33}
\]
