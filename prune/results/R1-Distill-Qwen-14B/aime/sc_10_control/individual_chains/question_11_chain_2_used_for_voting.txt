Okay, so I have this problem here: I need to find the largest possible real part of the expression \[(75 + 117i)z + \frac{96 + 144i}{z}\], where \( z \) is a complex number with \( |z| = 4 \). Hmm, okay, let me break this down step by step.

First, I remember that any complex number \( z \) can be written in the form \( z = re^{i\theta} \), where \( r \) is the modulus of \( z \) and \( \theta \) is the argument. Since \( |z| = 4 \), that means \( r = 4 \). So, \( z = 4e^{i\theta} \). That seems straightforward.

Now, let's substitute \( z \) into the expression. The first part is \( (75 + 117i)z \). So substituting \( z = 4e^{i\theta} \), that becomes \( (75 + 117i) \times 4e^{i\theta} \). Let me compute that first.

Multiply 75 and 117 by 4: 75*4 is 300, and 117*4 is 468. So it becomes \( 300 + 468i \) multiplied by \( e^{i\theta} \). Wait, actually, that's not correct. Wait, no, \( (75 + 117i) \times 4 = 300 + 468i \), right. So the first term is \( (300 + 468i)e^{i\theta} \).

The second term in the expression is \( \frac{96 + 144i}{z} \). Since \( z = 4e^{i\theta} \), \( 1/z = \frac{1}{4}e^{-i\theta} \). So, substituting, that term becomes \( (96 + 144i) \times \frac{1}{4}e^{-i\theta} \). Let me compute the scalar multiplication: 96/4 is 24, and 144/4 is 36. So that term is \( (24 + 36i)e^{-i\theta} \).

So now, the entire expression becomes:
\[
(300 + 468i)e^{i\theta} + (24 + 36i)e^{-i\theta}
\]
Hmm, okay. I need to find the real part of this expression and then maximize it with respect to \( \theta \).

Let me think about how to compute this. Since \( e^{i\theta} = \cos\theta + i\sin\theta \) and \( e^{-i\theta} = \cos\theta - i\sin\theta \), I can expand both terms.

Let me denote \( A = 300 + 468i \) and \( B = 24 + 36i \). So, the expression is \( A e^{i\theta} + B e^{-i\theta} \).

Expanding each term:
\( A e^{i\theta} = (300 + 468i)(\cos\theta + i\sin\theta) \)
Similarly, \( B e^{-i\theta} = (24 + 36i)(\cos\theta - i\sin\theta) \)

Let me compute each product separately.

First, \( A e^{i\theta} \):
= 300\cos\theta + 300i\sin\theta + 468i\cos\theta + 468i^2 \sin\theta
= 300\cos\theta + (300\sin\theta + 468\cos\theta)i - 468\sin\theta
Because \( i^2 = -1 \).

So, the real part is \( 300\cos\theta - 468\sin\theta \) and the imaginary part is \( 300\sin\theta + 468\cos\theta \).

Similarly for \( B e^{-i\theta} \):
= 24\cos\theta -24i\sin\theta +36i\cos\theta -36i^2 \sin\theta
= 24\cos\theta + ( -24\sin\theta +36\cos\theta )i +36\sin\theta
Again, since \( i^2 = -1 \), the last term becomes positive.

So, the real part is \( 24\cos\theta +36\sin\theta \) and the imaginary part is \( -24\sin\theta + 36\cos\theta \).

Now, adding the two expanded terms together:

Real parts:
\( (300\cos\theta - 468\sin\theta) + (24\cos\theta +36\sin\theta) \)
= \( (300 +24)\cos\theta + (-468 +36)\sin\theta \)
= 324\cos\theta - 432\sin\theta

Imaginary parts:
\( (300\sin\theta +468\cos\theta) + (-24\sin\theta +36\cos\theta) \)
= \( (300 -24)\sin\theta + (468 +36)\cos\theta \)
= 276\sin\theta + 504\cos\theta

But since we're only interested in the real part of the entire expression, we can ignore the imaginary parts.

So, our real part is \( 324\cos\theta -432\sin\theta \). Now, we need to find the maximum value of this expression as \( \theta \) varies.

Hmm, so I have an expression of the form \( R\cos\theta + S\sin\theta \), which can be rewritten as \( C\cos(\theta + \phi) \) or \( C\sin(\theta + \phi) \), and the maximum of that would be \( C \), where \( C = \sqrt{R^2 + S^2} \).

Wait, but in our case, it's \( R\cos\theta + S\sin\theta \), right? Let me check. So \( R = 324 \), \( S = -432 \).

Wait, no, actually, it's \( 324\cos\theta -432\sin\theta \). That can be written as \( R\cos\theta + S\sin\theta \) with \( S = -432 \).

So, to write this as a single sinusoidal function, we can express it as \( C\cos(\theta + \phi) \), where \( C = \sqrt{R^2 + S^2} \).

Wait, let me recall the formula. The expression \( a\cos\theta + b\sin\theta \) can be written as \( C\cos(\theta - \phi) \), where \( C = \sqrt{a^2 + b^2} \) and \( \tan\phi = b/a \). Alternatively, depending on the signs, it might be \( C\sin(\theta + \phi) \) or something similar. But the main point is that the maximum value is \( C \), the amplitude.

So, let me compute \( C = \sqrt{324^2 + (-432)^2} \). Let me compute each square.

324 squared: 324 * 324. Let me compute 300^2 = 90,000, 24^2=576, and cross term 2*300*24=14,400. So, (300+24)^2 = 300^2 + 2*300*24 +24^2 = 90,000 + 14,400 + 576 = 105, 000 +14,400 is 104,400 + 576 is 104,976. So 324^2 = 104,976.

Similarly, 432 squared: 400^2=160,000, 32^2=1,024, cross term 2*400*32=25,600. So, (400+32)^2 = 160,000 + 25,600 + 1,024 = 160,000 +25,600 = 185,600 +1,024=186,624. But since it's (-432)^2, it's the same as 432^2, which is 186,624.

So, \( C = \sqrt{104,976 + 186,624} \). Let's compute 104,976 + 186,624.

104,976 + 186,624: 100,000 + 180,000 = 280,000; 4,976 + 6,624 = 11,600. So total is 291,600.

So, \( C = \sqrt{291,600} \). Let me compute that. I know that 500^2 = 250,000, 600^2=360,000. So it's between 500 and 600.

Let me see: 540^2 = (500 + 40)^2 = 500^2 + 2*500*40 +40^2 = 250,000 +40,000 +1,600=291,600. Oh! So, 540^2 is exactly 291,600.

So, \( C = 540 \). Therefore, the maximum real part is 540.

Wait, but wait a second. Let me make sure I didn't make a mistake here. So, the expression was \( 324\cos\theta - 432\sin\theta \). When I converted it to \( C\cos(\theta + \phi) \), the maximum value is \( C \), which is 540. So, the maximum real part is 540.

But hold on, is there a possibility that this maximum is achieved? Because sometimes, when dealing with phasors or sinusoidal functions, the maximum is indeed the amplitude. But let me verify.

Alternatively, I can think of this expression as a function \( f(\theta) = 324\cos\theta -432\sin\theta \). To find its maximum, I can take the derivative and set it to zero.

The derivative of \( f(\theta) \) with respect to \( \theta \) is \( -324\sin\theta -432\cos\theta \). Setting this equal to zero:

\( -324\sin\theta -432\cos\theta = 0 \)

Which simplifies to:

\( 324\sin\theta + 432\cos\theta = 0 \)

Divide both sides by 108 (the greatest common divisor of 324 and 432):

324/108 = 3; 432/108 =4.

So, 3 sinθ + 4 cosθ = 0.

Rearranged: 3 sinθ = -4 cosθ

Divide both sides by cosθ (assuming cosθ ≠ 0):

3 tanθ = -4

tanθ = -4/3

So, θ is in the second or fourth quadrant. Let's pick θ = arctan(-4/3). But since tangent is periodic with π, the principal value is in the fourth quadrant.

But perhaps it's better to compute θ in the second quadrant as well. Let's denote θ = arctan(-4/3). But regardless, when I plug θ back into the original expression, I should get the maximum.

Alternatively, since we already know the amplitude is 540, which is the maximum value of \( f(\theta) \), so that's consistent.

So, the maximum real part is 540.

Wait, but let me double-check. Sometimes, when dealing with complex expressions, especially when you have both \( z \) and \( 1/z \), is there a different approach?

Alternatively, maybe using the fact that if \( |z|=4 \), then \( z \overline{z} = |z|^2 =16 \), so \( \overline{z} = 16/z \). Hmm, not sure if that helps here, but perhaps I can represent the expression differently.

Let me write the original expression:

\( (75 + 117i)z + \frac{96 + 144i}{z} \)

Since \( |z|=4 \), \( z \overline{z} =16 \), so \( \overline{z} =16/z \). Hmm, so maybe I can write the entire expression in terms of \( z + \overline{z} \) or something similar.

Wait, let's denote \( w = z \). Then, the expression becomes:

\( (75 + 117i)w + (96 + 144i)/w \)

But I don't see an immediate simplification here. Alternatively, perhaps I can factor something out.

Wait, looking back, I think my initial approach is correct. Expressing \( z \) as \( 4e^{i\theta} \), substituting, expanding, and then finding the real part, which simplifies to \( 324\cos\theta -432\sin\theta \), whose maximum is 540.

Alternatively, perhaps I can factor the expression further. Let me see:

The real part is \( 324\cos\theta -432\sin\theta \). Let me factor out 108:

108*(3 cosθ -4 sinθ). Hmm, 3 and 4, that's familiar. The expression inside the parentheses is 3cosθ -4 sinθ. So, this is similar to R cos(theta + phi), but in any case, the amplitude would be 5, because sqrt(3^2 +4^2)=5.

Wait, 3cosθ -4 sinθ can be written as 5 cos(theta + phi), where phi is arctan(4/3). So, 3cosθ -4 sinθ =5 cos(theta + phi). Therefore, 108*5=540. So, that's consistent with my previous calculation. So, the maximum is indeed 540.

Therefore, the largest possible real part is 540.

To find the largest possible real part of the expression \[(75 + 117i)z + \frac{96 + 144i}{z}\] where \( z \) is a complex number with \( |z| = 4 \), we start by expressing \( z \) as \( 4e^{i\theta} \). Substituting \( z = 4e^{i\theta} \) and \( 1/z = \frac{1}{4}e^{-i\theta} \) into the expression, we get:

\[
(300 + 468i)e^{i\theta} + (24 + 36i)e^{-i\theta}
\]

Expanding each term using \( e^{i\theta} = \cos\theta + i\sin\theta \) and \( e^{-i\theta} = \cos\theta - i\sin\theta \), we find the real part of the expression:

\[
324\cos\theta - 432\sin\theta
\]

This can be rewritten as \( 108(3\cos\theta - 4\sin\theta) \), which has an amplitude of \( 108 \times 5 = 540 \). Thus, the maximum real part is:

\[
\boxed{540}
\]
