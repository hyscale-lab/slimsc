Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the number of triples of nonnegative integers (a, b, c) such that a + b + c = 300 and a²b + a²c + b²a + b²c + c²a + c²b = 6,000,000. Hmm, that seems a bit complicated, but let me try to break it down.

First, I remember that when dealing with equations involving sums of variables and their products, sometimes symmetric expressions or factoring can help. Let me write down what's given:

1. a + b + c = 300
2. a²b + a²c + b²a + b²c + c²a + c²b = 6,000,000

Looking at the second equation, it's a sum of terms where each term is a square of one variable multiplied by another. It seems symmetric in a, b, c but not entirely because each term is a product of two different variables. Maybe I can factor it somehow.

Let me see: a²b + a²c = a²(b + c). Similarly, b²a + b²c = b²(a + c), and c²a + c²b = c²(a + b). So, if I rewrite the second equation using this:

a²(b + c) + b²(a + c) + c²(a + b) = 6,000,000.

Hmm, okay. Now, since a + b + c = 300, I can express (b + c) as (300 - a), (a + c) as (300 - b), and (a + b) as (300 - c). Let me substitute that in:

a²(300 - a) + b²(300 - b) + c²(300 - c) = 6,000,000.

That simplifies the equation a bit. Let me expand each term:

= 300a² - a³ + 300b² - b³ + 300c² - c³
= 300(a² + b² + c²) - (a³ + b³ + c³)

So now, the equation becomes:

300(a² + b² + c²) - (a³ + b³ + c³) = 6,000,000.

Hmm, maybe I can relate this to known symmetric sums. Let me recall that (a + b + c)^2 = a² + b² + c² + 2(ab + ac + bc). So, since a + b + c = 300, we have:

300² = a² + b² + c² + 2(ab + ac + bc)
=> 90,000 = a² + b² + c² + 2(ab + ac + bc)
So, a² + b² + c² = 90,000 - 2(ab + ac + bc).

Let me denote S = a + b + c = 300, Q = ab + ac + bc, and P = abc. Maybe I can find expressions in terms of S, Q, and P.

From the above, a² + b² + c² = S² - 2Q = 90,000 - 2Q.

So, plugging back into the equation 300(a² + b² + c²) - (a³ + b³ + c³) = 6,000,000:

300(90,000 - 2Q) - (a³ + b³ + c³) = 6,000,000.

Calculate 300 * 90,000: that's 27,000,000. Then 300 * (-2Q) is -600Q. So,

27,000,000 - 600Q - (a³ + b³ + c³) = 6,000,000.

Let me rearrange:

- (a³ + b³ + c³) = 6,000,000 - 27,000,000 + 600Q
=> -(a³ + b³ + c³) = -21,000,000 + 600Q
Multiply both sides by -1:

a³ + b³ + c³ = 21,000,000 - 600Q.

Hmm, is there a formula for a³ + b³ + c³ in terms of S, Q, and P? Yes! The formula is:

a³ + b³ + c³ = S³ - 3S Q + 3P.

Let me verify that. Let me expand (a + b + c)^3:

(a + b + c)^3 = a³ + b³ + c³ + 3(a²b + a²c + b²a + b²c + c²a + c²b) + 6abc.

So, a³ + b³ + c³ = S³ - 3(a²b + a²c + b²a + b²c + c²a + c²b) - 6abc.

Wait, but in our case, the second equation is a²b + a²c + ... which is 6,000,000. Hmm, so perhaps I can connect this.

Wait, no, let me be precise. I have:

From the expansion,

S³ = a³ + b³ + c³ + 3(a²b + a²c + b²a + b²c + c²a + c²b) + 6abc.

So,

a³ + b³ + c³ = S³ - 3(a²b + a²c + ...) - 6abc.

But from the given, a²b + a²c + ... = 6,000,000.

So,

a³ + b³ + c³ = 300³ - 3*6,000,000 - 6abc.

Calculate 300³: 300*300=90,000, 90,000*300=27,000,000.

So,

a³ + b³ + c³ = 27,000,000 - 18,000,000 - 6abc
= 9,000,000 - 6abc.

So, from earlier, I had:

a³ + b³ + c³ = 21,000,000 - 600Q.

Therefore,

9,000,000 - 6abc = 21,000,000 - 600Q.

Let me rearrange:

-6abc = 21,000,000 - 600Q - 9,000,000
=> -6abc = 12,000,000 - 600Q
Multiply both sides by (-1):

6abc = -12,000,000 + 600Q
Divide both sides by 6:

abc = (-12,000,000)/6 + (600Q)/6
abc = -2,000,000 + 100Q.

So, we have:

abc = 100Q - 2,000,000.

Hmm, okay. So, now I have expressions relating Q and abc. Let me see what I can do next.

Recall that S = a + b + c = 300, Q = ab + ac + bc, and P = abc.

So, perhaps I can find Q in terms of P or vice versa.

Wait, from the above, I have P = 100Q - 2,000,000.

So, I can write Q = (P + 2,000,000) / 100.

But I also know that for three variables, the elementary symmetric sums are S, Q, P. Maybe I can find a relationship that uses these.

Alternatively, perhaps I can consider the variables a, b, c as roots of a cubic equation. Let me think about that.

If a, b, c are roots of the cubic equation x³ - Sx² + Qx - P = 0, then the equation would be x³ - 300x² + Qx - P = 0.

But I'm not sure if that helps directly, but maybe I can think about the possible integer roots.

Alternatively, perhaps I can look for possible values of a, b, c such that their sum is 300 and they satisfy the other equation. Since all are nonnegative integers, perhaps the variables are not too large.

But 300 is a large number, so a, b, c could be anywhere from 0 up to 300. But with the second condition, maybe that restricts them more.

Wait, let's think about the second condition: a²b + a²c + b²a + b²c + c²a + c²b = 6,000,000.

Let me factor this as ab(a + b) + bc(b + c) + ac(a + c).

Hmm, but since a + b + c = 300, each of these pairs sums to 300 minus the third variable.

So, (a + b) = 300 - c, (b + c) = 300 - a, (a + c) = 300 - b.

So, the second equation can be written as ab(300 - c) + bc(300 - a) + ac(300 - b) = 6,000,000.

Let me expand this:

ab*300 - ab c + bc*300 - bc a + ac*300 - ac b = 6,000,000.

Factor the terms:

300(ab + bc + ac) - abc(a + b + c) = 6,000,000.

Ah! Because:

- ab c is abc, and similarly for the others. So, the sum is 300(ab + bc + ac) - 3abc*(something?), wait, no:

Wait, each term is ab*c, bc*a, ac*b. So, each is abc, but multiplied by different variables. Wait, no, let me check:

Wait, ab*c = abc, bc*a = abc, ac*b = abc. So, the sum is 3abc.

So, the equation becomes:

300(ab + bc + ac) - 3abc = 6,000,000.

So, 300Q - 3P = 6,000,000.

Divide both sides by 3:

100Q - P = 2,000,000.

So, P = 100Q - 2,000,000.

Wait, that's the same equation I had earlier. So, that's consistent.

So, now, I have two equations:

1. a + b + c = 300
2. ab + bc + ac = Q
3. abc = 100Q - 2,000,000

So, in terms of symmetric sums, the variables a, b, c are the roots of the cubic equation x³ - 300x² + Qx - (100Q - 2,000,000) = 0.

Simplify the equation:

x³ - 300x² + Qx - 100Q + 2,000,000 = 0.

Hmm, this feels a bit tricky. Maybe I can write it as:

x³ - 300x² + Q(x - 100) + 2,000,000 = 0.

But I'm not sure if that helps. Alternatively, perhaps I can factor this.

Wait, maybe I can factor x³ - 300x² as x²(x - 300). So:

x²(x - 300) + Q(x - 100) + 2,000,000 = 0.

Hmm, not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps I can think of this as a cubic equation in x, and think about possible integer roots.

If a, b, c are integers, then they are roots of this cubic. So, maybe I can try to find integer roots.

But 300 is a large number, so perhaps the variables are in the hundreds. Maybe I can look for small roots or something.

Wait, perhaps I can assume that two variables are equal? Or maybe one variable is zero?

Wait, if one variable is zero, say c = 0, then a + b = 300, and the second equation becomes a²b + a²*0 + b²a + b²*0 + 0²a + 0²b = a²b + b²a = ab(a + b) = ab*300.

So, 300ab = 6,000,000 => ab = 20,000.

So, if c = 0, then a + b = 300 and ab = 20,000.

Then, how many solutions are there for a and b?

We can write this as a quadratic: x² - 300x + 20,000 = 0.

The discriminant is 300² - 4*20,000 = 90,000 - 80,000 = 10,000.

Which is 100², so roots are [300 ± 100]/2.

So, (300 + 100)/2 = 400/2 = 200, and (300 - 100)/2 = 200/2 = 100. So, a=200, b=100 or a=100, b=200.

So, for c=0, we have two solutions: (200,100,0) and (100,200,0). But since the problem counts ordered triples, each is distinct.

But wait, are we considering ordered triples? The question says "triples of nonnegative integers (a,b,c)", so order matters. So, each permutation is a different solution.

But in this case, c=0, so a and b can be swapped. So, for c=0, we have two ordered triples.

Similarly, if a=0, then we'd have b + c = 300 and bc = 20,000. Which would give similar solutions: (0,200,100) and (0,100,200).

Similarly for b=0, we'd have (200,0,100) and (100,0,200). So, for each variable set to zero, we have two solutions, and there are three variables, so 3 * 2 = 6 solutions where one variable is zero.

But wait, wait, let me check that.

If a=0, then b + c = 300, and bc = 20,000. The solutions for b and c are 200 and 100, as before, so the triples would be (0,200,100) and (0,100,200). Similarly for b=0, we get (200,0,100) and (100,0,200). And for c=0, (200,100,0) and (100,200,0). So, yes, 6 ordered triples where one variable is zero.

But are there other solutions where none of a, b, c are zero? That is, all a, b, c are positive integers.

So, let me consider that case.

If a, b, c are all positive, then perhaps I can write the equations:

a + b + c = 300,

and

ab + bc + ac = Q,

and

abc = P = 100Q - 2,000,000.

But I also have the cubic equation:

x³ - 300x² + Qx - P = 0,

which is

x³ - 300x² + Qx - (100Q - 2,000,000) = 0.

So, let me write:

x³ - 300x² + Qx - 100Q + 2,000,000 = 0.

Hmm, maybe I can factor this equation.

Let me try to factor by grouping.

Group first two terms and last two terms:

(x³ - 300x²) + (Qx - 100Q + 2,000,000) = 0.

Factor x² from first group:

x²(x - 300) + Q(x - 100) + 2,000,000 = 0.

Hmm, not sure if that helps.

Alternatively, perhaps I can write it as:

x³ - 300x² + Q(x - 100) + 2,000,000 = 0.

Wait, maybe I can let x=100 and see if it's a root.

Plugging x=100:

100³ - 300*(100)² + Q*(100 - 100) + 2,000,000.

= 1,000,000 - 300*10,000 + 0 + 2,000,000

= 1,000,000 - 3,000,000 + 2,000,000 = 0.

So, x=100 is a root. That's interesting.

So, (x - 100) is a factor of the cubic. Let me perform polynomial division to factor it out.

Dividing x³ - 300x² + Qx - 100Q + 2,000,000 by (x - 100):

Using synthetic division:

100 | 1   -300      Q        (-100Q + 2,000,000)
          100     -20,000      Q - 20,000
      ----------------------------------------
        1   -200      Q - 20,000      ( -100Q + 2,000,000 + Q - 20,000 )

Wait, that's a bit messy, but let me compute step by step.

The coefficients are 1, -300, Q, (-100Q + 2,000,000).

Bring down the 1.

Multiply 1 by 100: 100. Add to -300: -200.

Multiply -200 by 100: -20,000. Add to Q: Q - 20,000.

Multiply (Q - 20,000) by 100: 100Q - 2,000,000. Add to (-100Q + 2,000,000):

(100Q - 2,000,000) + (-100Q + 2,000,000) = 0.

So, the cubic factors as (x - 100)(x² - 200x + (Q - 20,000)).

So, the cubic equation is:

(x - 100)(x² - 200x + Q - 20,000) = 0.

Therefore, the roots are x=100, and the roots of x² - 200x + (Q - 20,000) = 0.

So, the other two roots (since the cubic has three roots a, b, c) must satisfy the quadratic equation x² - 200x + (Q - 20,000) = 0.

Let me denote these roots as r and s. Then, r + s = 200 and rs = Q - 20,000.

But wait, the original sum a + b + c = 300, and one of them is 100. So, the other two add up to 200. Which matches.

So, a, b, c are 100, r, s where r + s = 200 and rs = Q - 20,000.

But also, since a, b, c are 100, r, s, then Q = ab + ac + bc.

Let me compute Q:

Q = (100*r) + (100*s) + (r*s).

But since r + s = 200, 100*(r + s) = 100*200 = 20,000. And r*s = Q - 20,000.

So, Q = 20,000 + (Q - 20,000) = Q.

Wait, that's a tautology. Hmm, perhaps another approach.

Wait, from the quadratic, we have rs = Q - 20,000.

So, Q = rs + 20,000.

But from the definition of Q, it's also Q = 100r + 100s + rs.

But since r + s = 200, 100(r + s) = 20,000.

So, Q = 20,000 + rs.

Which is consistent with the earlier equation Q = rs + 20,000.

So, that's consistent.

So, we have that the other two variables r and s satisfy r + s = 200 and rs = Q - 20,000.

But we also have from the earlier equation:

abc = 100Q - 2,000,000.

Since one of the variables is 100, abc = 100 * r * s.

So,

100 * r * s = 100 Q - 2,000,000.

Divide both sides by 100:

r * s = Q - 20,000.

But from the quadratic, we have rs = Q - 20,000. So, that's consistent.

Therefore, the variables are 100, r, s with r + s = 200 and rs = Q - 20,000.

So, perhaps this means that the only possible triples are those where one variable is 100, another is r, and the third is s, where r + s = 200 and rs = Q - 20,000.

But I think I'm going in circles here. Maybe I can consider that since a, b, c are nonnegative integers, and one of them is 100, the other two add up to 200.

So, perhaps the variables are 100, m, and 200 - m, where m is a nonnegative integer.

So, let me set a = 100, b = m, c = 200 - m.

Then, let me compute the second equation.

Wait, earlier, when one variable is 100, the other two add up to 200, so let's see what happens.

Wait, but in our earlier analysis, setting one variable to zero gave us two solutions, but in this case, setting one variable to 100, perhaps we can find the other variables.

Wait, but if one variable is 100, and the other two add up to 200, let's compute the second equation:

a²b + a²c + b²a + b²c + c²a + c²b.

With a=100, b=m, c=200 - m.

So,

100²*m + 100²*(200 - m) + m²*100 + m²*(200 - m) + (200 - m)^2*100 + (200 - m)^2*m.

Let me compute each term:

1. 100² * m = 10,000 m
2. 100² * (200 - m) = 10,000 (200 - m) = 2,000,000 - 10,000 m
3. m² * 100 = 100 m²
4. m² * (200 - m) = 200 m² - m³
5. (200 - m)^2 * 100 = 100*(40,000 - 400m + m²) = 4,000,000 - 40,000m + 100m²
6. (200 - m)^2 * m = m*(40,000 - 400m + m²) = 40,000m - 400m² + m³

Now, let me sum all these terms:

Terms 1 and 2:
10,000m + (2,000,000 - 10,000m) = 2,000,000.

Terms 3 and 5:
100m² + (4,000,000 - 40,000m + 100m²) = 200m² - 40,000m + 4,000,000.

Terms 4 and 6:
(200m² - m³) + (40,000m - 400m² + m³) = (200m² - 400m²) + (-m³ + m³) + 40,000m = (-200m²) + 0 + 40,000m.

Now, adding all together:

2,000,000 + (200m² - 40,000m + 4,000,000) + (-200m² + 40,000m) = 2,000,000 + 200m² -40,000m +4,000,000 -200m² +40,000m.

Simplify:

2,000,000 + 4,000,000 = 6,000,000.

The other terms cancel out: 200m² -200m² = 0, -40,000m +40,000m =0.

So, total is 6,000,000, which matches the second equation.

Wait a minute, that means that for any m, as long as a=100, b=m, c=200 -m, the second equation is satisfied.

So, does that mean that for any m from 0 to 200, inclusive, the triple (100, m, 200 -m) satisfies both equations?

But wait, let's check m=0: then c=200.

So, a=100, b=0, c=200.

Then, the first equation: 100 + 0 + 200 = 300. Correct.

Second equation: 100²*0 + 100²*200 + 0²*100 + 0²*200 + 200²*100 + 200²*0.

Which is 0 + 2,000,000 + 0 + 0 + 4,000,000 + 0 = 6,000,000. Correct.

Similarly, m=100: then b=100, c=100.

So, a=100, b=100, c=100.

Sum is 300. Second equation:

100²*100 * 2 (since three terms: a²b, a²c, b²c, etc., but with a=b=c=100, all terms are 100³, and there are 6 terms, so 6*100³=6,000,000. Correct.

So, seems like any triple where one variable is 100 and the other two add up to 200 will satisfy both conditions.

So, how many such triples are there?

Well, let's think about ordered triples.

Case 1: a=100, then b + c = 200. The number of ordered pairs (b,c) is 201 (since b can be 0 to 200, c=200 -b).

Similarly, if b=100, then a + c = 200, which gives 201 ordered triples where a=anything and c=200 -a.

Same for c=100: a + b =200, giving 201 ordered triples.

But wait, if we just add them up, 3*201=603, but this counts the cases where two variables are 100 multiple times.

For example, the triple (100,100,100) is counted three times: once in each case.

Similarly, the triple (100, 100, 100) is the only triple where two variables are 100, but in our earlier analysis, when one variable is zero, the other two are 200 and 100, but that's not the same.

Wait, actually, no. In the case where a=100, b=100, then c=100. So, this is the only triple where two variables are 100.

Wait, but when a=100, and b=100, then c=100. Similarly for other permutations.

So, how many ordered triples have two variables as 100?

If a=100 and b=100, then c=100.

Similarly, a=100 and c=100, then b=100.

And b=100 and c=100, then a=100.

So, three ordered triples where two variables are 100: all are the same triple (100,100,100), but in different orders. Wait no, (100,100,100) is the same in all orders.

Wait, no, in ordered triples, all permutations are considered different if the positions differ. But in this case, (100,100,100) is the same in all positions, so it's only one unique ordered triple.

Wait, but in reality, it's the same triple regardless of permutation since all are 100. So, when we count ordered triples, (100,100,100) is just one.

But in our earlier counting, when a=100, we have (100, b, c) where b + c=200, which includes (100,100,100) once.

Similarly, when b=100, we have (a,100,c) where a + c=200, which includes (100,100,100) once.

Same for c=100. So, in total, (100,100,100) is counted three times in the total of 3*201=603.

So, total number of ordered triples where at least one variable is 100 is 603, but we have to subtract the duplicates.

Wait, the triple (100,100,100) is counted three times, but it's a single unique triple. So, how do we adjust for that?

Wait, actually, in the case where a=100, the number of triples is 201, as b can range from 0 to 200, so c=200 -b.

Similarly, for b=100, 201 triples, and same for c=100. So, total is 3*201=603.

But in these 603, the triple (100,100,100) is counted three times.

So, to find the total number of distinct ordered triples where at least one variable is 100, we can compute:

Total = 3*201 - 3*2 +1 ?

Wait, perhaps it's better to think that the number of ordered triples where exactly one variable is 100 is 3*(200), because for each position, there's 200 possibilities where the other two add up to 200 and are not 100.

Wait, maybe not. Let me think differently.

When a=100, the number of ordered triples is 201 (b from 0 to 200). Similarly for b=100 and c=100.

But in each of these, the triple (100,100,100) is included once. So, overlapping occurs only at this triple.

So, the total number of ordered triples is:

Number when a=100: 201

Number when b=100: 201

Number when c=100: 201

But subtract the overlaps where two variables are 100. Each overlap is counted twice.

Wait, actually, the triple (100,100,100) is the only triple where two variables are 100, and it's counted three times in the initial count.

So, using inclusion-exclusion:

Total = (3 * 201) - (3 * 1) + 1

Wait, no. Let me recall inclusion-exclusion formula.

Total = |A| + |B| + |C| - |A∩B| - |A∩C| - |B∩C| + |A∩B∩C|

Where A is the set where a=100, B where b=100, C where c=100.

So,

|A| = |B| = |C| = 201

|A∩B| is the set where a=100 and b=100, which implies c=100. So, |A∩B|=1.

Similarly, |A∩C|=1, |B∩C|=1.

|A∩B∩C| is the set where a=100, b=100, c=100: size 1.

So,

Total = 201 + 201 + 201 - 1 -1 -1 +1 = 603 - 3 +1 = 601.

So, the total number of ordered triples where at least one variable is 100 is 601.

Wait, but earlier when we set a variable to zero, we found 6 ordered triples. Are these included in the 601?

Yes, because when a=100, b can be zero, which gives c=200. Similarly for other variables.

So, all the triples where one variable is zero are included in the 601.

But wait, in our earlier analysis, when one variable is zero, we get 6 ordered triples. But in this inclusion-exclusion, we have 601 ordered triples where at least one variable is 100, which includes those with a zero.

But in the problem statement, we have to count all triples where a + b + c =300 and the other equation holds. From earlier, we saw that any triple where one variable is 100 and the other two add to 200 will satisfy both equations, regardless of whether the other variables are zero or not.

So, that would suggest that the total number of solutions is 601.

Wait, but let me think again.

Earlier, when we set a=100, and let b and c be 200 - b, we saw that the second equation is satisfied. So, for each of the 201 ordered pairs (b,c) with b + c=200, the triple (100, b, c) satisfies both equations.

Similarly, when b=100 or c=100, the same logic applies.

Therefore, all these 601 ordered triples satisfy the conditions. But wait, let me check.

Wait, 601 includes all triples where a=100, b=100, or c=100, with the other variables adding up appropriately. But in our earlier analysis, when one variable is zero, the other two are 200 and 100, which are included in these 601.

But wait, when a=100, b=0, c=200 is included in the 201 when a=100. Similarly, when a=0, b=200, c=100 is included in the 201 when b=100.

Wait, no. When a=0, it's not included in the a=100 case. So, perhaps the 601 includes only the triples where one variable is 100, not variables being zero.

Wait, I think I'm getting confused.

Actually, when a=100, b can be zero, making c=200. So, in this case, the triple (100,0,200) is included in the a=100 count.

Similarly, (100,200,0) is another triple when a=100, b=200, c=0.

But when a=0, it's not part of the a=100 count. So, to get all the triples where one variable is zero, we have to look separately.

Wait, but earlier, when a=0, then b + c=300, and bc=20,000, which gave us two triples: (0,200,100) and (0,100,200).

Similarly for b=0 and c=0. So, 6 triples in total.

But in the 601 count, these 6 triples are included, because when a=100, b can be 0 or 200; when b=100, a can be 0 or 200; and when c=100, a can be 0 or 200.

Wait, let me check:

For a=100, b can be 0 to 200. So, when b=0, c=200; when b=200, c=0. So, two triples: (100,0,200) and (100,200,0).

Similarly, for b=100, a can be 0 to 200. So, a=0, c=200; a=200, c=0. So, (0,100,200) and (200,100,0).

For c=100, a can be 0 to 200. So, a=0, b=200; a=200, b=0. So, (0,200,100) and (200,0,100).

So, in total, 6 ordered triples where one variable is 100 and another is zero, and the third is 200.

So, these 6 are included in the 601 count.

But wait, 601 is the total number of ordered triples where at least one variable is 100. So, in addition to these, are there other triples where none of the variables are 100, but still satisfy the equations?

Wait, from the earlier analysis, the only solutions are those where one variable is 100 and the others add to 200. So, there are no other solutions where none of the variables are 100.

Wait, because when we started with the cubic equation, we found that x=100 is a root, so the other two variables must satisfy r + s = 200 and rs = Q - 20,000.

Therefore, the only solutions are those where one variable is 100, and the other two sum to 200.

Therefore, all solutions are captured in the 601 count.

Wait, but let's double-check.

Suppose I take a triple where none of a, b, c is 100. Would it satisfy the given equations?

Suppose a=1, b=1, c=297.

Compute a + b + c = 300, that's correct.

Compute a²b + a²c + b²a + b²c + c²a + c²b.

= 1²*1 + 1²*297 + 1²*1 + 1²*297 + 297²*1 + 297²*1.

= 1 + 297 + 1 + 297 + 88209 + 88209

= (1 + 297 +1 +297) + (88209 +88209)

= (600) + (176,418) = 177,018 ≠ 6,000,000.

So, that triple doesn't satisfy the equation.

Another example: a=50, b=150, c=100.

Sum is 50 + 150 + 100 = 300.

Compute the second equation:

50²*150 + 50²*100 + 150²*50 + 150²*100 + 100²*50 + 100²*150.

Compute each term:

50²=2500: 2500*150=375,000; 2500*100=250,000.

150²=22500: 22500*50=1,125,000; 22500*100=2,250,000.

100²=10,000: 10,000*50=500,000; 10,000*150=1,500,000.

Sum all these:

375,000 + 250,000 = 625,000

1,125,000 + 2,250,000 = 3,375,000

500,000 + 1,500,000 = 2,000,000

Total: 625,000 + 3,375,000 = 4,000,000; 4,000,000 + 2,000,000 = 6,000,000.

So, this triple satisfies the equations, and in this case, c=100, so it's included in the 601 count.

Another example: a=99, b=101, c=100.

Sum is 300.

Compute the second equation:

99²*101 + 99²*100 + 101²*99 + 101²*100 + 100²*99 + 100²*101.

99²=9801: 9801*101=989,901; 9801*100=980,100.

101²=10,201: 10,201*99=1,009, 899; 10,201*100=1,020,100.

100²=10,000: 10,000*99=990,000; 10,000*101=1,010,000.

Adding all:

989,901 + 980,100 = 1,970,001

1,009,899 + 1,020,100 = 2,029,999

990,000 + 1,010,000 = 2,000,000

Total: 1,970,001 + 2,029,999 = 4,000,000; 4,000,000 + 2,000,000 = 6,000,000.

So, this also satisfies. And here, c=100. So, included in the count.

So, seems like all the solutions are accounted for in the 601 count.

But wait, is that correct? Because earlier, when I thought about setting a variable to zero, I only found 6 solutions, but in reality, when a variable is 100, and another is zero, that's 6 solutions. But the total number of solutions where one variable is 100 is 601, which includes these 6.

Therefore, the total number of solutions is 601.

But wait, earlier, when I considered the case where a=100, the number of ordered triples is 201, same for b=100 and c=100. But when summed, they include overlaps.

But according to inclusion-exclusion, the total is 601.

But wait, let me compute 3*201 - 3*1 +1:

3*201 = 603

Subtract 3*1=3: 603-3=600

Add 1: 601.

Yes, that's correct.

So, the number of ordered triples is 601.

Wait, but earlier when I thought about when one variable is zero, there were 6 solutions. So, 6 is much less than 601. So, 601 is the correct total.

But wait, just to be thorough, let me think: How many triples have exactly one variable as 100, and the other two not equal to 100.

For a=100, the number of triples where b ≠100 and c≠100: b can be from 0 to 200, excluding 100. So, 201 total, minus 1 (where b=100) = 200.

Similarly for b=100, 200 triples where a≠100 and c≠100.

And same for c=100.

But wait, the triple where two variables are 100 is (100,100,100), which is counted once.

So, the number of triples where exactly one variable is 100: 3*(201 -1) - 3*(1) +1.

Wait, maybe it's better not to get bogged down, since according to inclusion-exclusion, the total is 601.

So, I think that's the answer: 601.

But wait, let me think again.

Wait, each time we fix a=100, and vary b from 0 to 200. So, 201 possibilities.

Similarly, for b=100 and c=100.

But when you do this, the triple (100,100,100) is counted three times.

So, the total number of ordered triples is 3*201 - 2*1 = 603 -2=601.

Yes, that makes sense.

Therefore, the number of ordered triples is 601.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The problem requires finding the number of ordered triples of nonnegative integers \((a, b, c)\) such that \(a + b + c = 300\) and \(a^2b + a^2c + b^2a + b^2c + c^2a + c^2b = 6,000,000\).

First, we rewrite the second equation using the identity \(a^2b + a^2c + b^2a + b^2c + c^2a + c^2b = 300(ab + bc + ac) - 3abc\). Substituting this into the equation gives:

\[
300(ab + bc + ac) - 3abc = 6,000,000.
\]

Dividing through by 3 simplifies to:

\[
100(ab + bc + ac) - abc = 2,000,000.
\]

Let \(S = a + b + c = 300\), \(Q = ab + bc + ac\), and \(P = abc\). The equation becomes:

\[
100Q - P = 2,000,000 \quad \Rightarrow \quad P = 100Q - 2,000,000.
\]

We also know that \(a, b, c\) are roots of the cubic equation:

\[
x^3 - 300x^2 + Qx - P = 0.
\]

Substituting \(P = 100Q - 2,000,000\) into the cubic equation gives:

\[
x^3 - 300x^2 + Qx - (100Q - 2,000,000) = 0.
\]

Factoring this equation reveals that \(x = 100\) is a root. Thus, the cubic factors as:

\[
(x - 100)(x^2 - 200x + Q - 20,000) = 0.
\]

This implies that one of the variables is 100, and the other two variables, say \(r\) and \(s\), satisfy \(r + s = 200\) and \(rs = Q - 20,000\). Therefore, the triples \((a, b, c)\) must include 100 and two other nonnegative integers that sum to 200.

To count the number of such ordered triples, consider the following:

1. Fix \(a = 100\). Then \(b + c = 200\), giving 201 ordered pairs \((b, c)\).
2. Similarly, fix \(b = 100\) or \(c = 100\), each yielding 201 ordered triples.

However, the triple \((100, 100, 100)\) is counted three times in the above steps. Using inclusion-exclusion:

\[
\text{Total} = 3 \times 201 - 3 \times 1 + 1 = 603 - 3 + 1 = 601.
\]

Thus, the number of ordered triples is:

\[
\boxed{601}
\]
