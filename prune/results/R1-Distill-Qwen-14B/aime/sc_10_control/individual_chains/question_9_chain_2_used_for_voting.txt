Okay, so I've got this problem here where I need to find the product of two real numbers x and y, both greater than 1. The conditions given are that the logarithm of y^x with base x is 10, and the logarithm of x^{4y} with base y is also 10. Hmm, that's a bit to unpack, but I think I can handle it.

Let me write down the equations to make it clearer. The first equation is log base x of y^x equals 10. So, in mathematical terms, that would be:

log_x(y^x) = 10

And the second equation is log base y of x^{4y} equals 10, which is:

log_y(x^{4y}) = 10

Okay, I remember that logarithms can be tricky, but there are some properties I can use here. The general property is that log_b(a) = c means that b^c = a. So maybe I can rewrite these logarithmic equations into exponential form. Let me try that.

Starting with the first equation: log_x(y^x) = 10. Converting this to exponential form, it means that x^10 = y^x. So:

x^10 = y^x  ... (1)

Now, moving on to the second equation: log_y(x^{4y}) = 10. Applying the same property, this converts to y^10 = x^{4y}. So:

y^10 = x^{4y}  ... (2)

Alright, so now I have two equations:

1. x^10 = y^x
2. y^10 = x^{4y}

Hmm, I need to relate these to find x and y. Maybe I can express one variable in terms of the other and substitute. Let me see.

From equation (1): x^10 = y^x. Let's take both sides to the power of 1/x to solve for y. So,

y = (x^10)^(1/x) = x^(10/x)

So, y is equal to x raised to the power of 10/x. That gives me y in terms of x. Maybe I can substitute this into equation (2).

Substituting y = x^(10/x) into equation (2):

(y)^10 = x^{4y}

Which becomes:

(x^(10/x))^10 = x^{4y}

Simplify the left side: (x^(10/x))^10 is x^{(10/x)*10} = x^{100/x}

So:

x^{100/x} = x^{4y}

Since the bases are the same and x > 1, their exponents must be equal. So:

100/x = 4y

Hmm, that's a useful equation. Let me write that down:

100/x = 4y  ... (3)

But from earlier, I have y = x^(10/x). Let me substitute that into equation (3):

100/x = 4 * x^(10/x)

So, 100/x = 4x^(10/x)

Let me divide both sides by 4 to make it simpler:

25/x = x^(10/x)

Hmm, okay. So now I have:

25/x = x^{10/x}

Hmm, this seems a bit complicated. Maybe I can take logarithms on both sides to simplify it. Let's choose natural logarithm for this purpose.

Taking ln of both sides:

ln(25/x) = ln(x^{10/x})

Simplify the right side using logarithm properties: ln(a^b) = b ln a.

So, right side becomes (10/x) ln x

The left side, ln(25/x), can be written as ln 25 - ln x.

So:

ln 25 - ln x = (10/x) ln x

Let me rearrange this:

ln 25 = (10/x) ln x + ln x

Factor out ln x on the right side:

ln 25 = ln x * (10/x + 1)

Hmm, that's an equation with ln x. Let me denote t = ln x to make it simpler. So, t = ln x. Then, x = e^t.

Substituting into the equation:

ln 25 = t * (10/(e^t) + 1)

Wait, 10/x is 10/(e^t), which is 10 e^{-t}.

So:

ln25 = t (10 e^{-t} + 1)

Hmm, this seems a bit messy, but maybe I can multiply both sides by e^t to eliminate the exponential in the denominator.

Multiply both sides by e^t:

e^t ln25 = t (10 + e^t)

Hmm, so:

e^t ln25 = 10t + t e^t

Let me rearrange all terms to one side:

e^t ln25 - t e^t - 10t = 0

Factor out e^t from the first two terms:

e^t (ln25 - t) - 10t = 0

Hmm, not sure if that helps directly, but maybe I can write it as:

e^t (ln25 - t) = 10t

Divide both sides by t (assuming t ≠ 0, which it can't be because x > 1, so t = ln x > 0):

e^t (ln25 - t)/t = 10

Hmm, still looks complicated. Maybe I can make a substitution here. Let me set u = t. Then, the equation is:

e^u (ln25 - u)/u = 10

Hmm, but that doesn't seem to help much. Alternatively, perhaps I can try to find a value for t that makes this equation true.

This seems a bit tricky, but maybe there's a clever substitution or perhaps we can assume that t is a multiple of ln25. Let me see.

Alternatively, perhaps I can take a step back and see if there's another way to approach this problem without getting into such complex equations.

Wait, maybe taking logs in a different base or using logarithm properties differently.

Let me go back to equation (1) and (2):

Equation (1): x^10 = y^x

Equation (2): y^10 = x^{4y}

I can take logarithms of both equations with the same base, say base 10, to make it easier.

Taking log of equation (1):

log(x^10) = log(y^x)

Which simplifies to:

10 log x = x log y

Similarly, taking log of equation (2):

log(y^10) = log(x^{4y})

Which simplifies to:

10 log y = 4y log x

So now, I have two equations:

10 log x = x log y  ... (4)

10 log y = 4y log x  ... (5)

Hmm, now I have a system of two equations with two variables: log x and log y.

Let me denote a = log x and b = log y. Then, equations become:

10a = x b  ... (4a)

10b = 4y a  ... (5a)

But wait, x = 10^{a} because a = log x. Similarly, y = 10^{b}.

So, substituting x = 10^a and y = 10^b into equations (4a) and (5a):

Equation (4a): 10a = 10^a * b

Equation (5a): 10b = 4 * 10^b * a

So, now the system is:

10a = 10^a b  ... (6)

10b = 4 * 10^b a  ... (7)

Hmm, this might not be much better, but maybe I can express b from equation (6) and substitute into equation (7).

From equation (6): b = (10a) / 10^a.

So, b = 10a / 10^a.

Substituting this into equation (7):

10*(10a / 10^a) = 4 * 10^b * a

Simplify left side: 100a / 10^a.

Right side: 4 * 10^b * a.

So,

100a / 10^a = 4 * 10^b * a.

We can cancel a from both sides (since a is log x, which is positive because x >1, so a ≠ 0):

100 / 10^a = 4 * 10^b

Simplify 100 / 10^a as 10^{2 - a}.

So,

10^{2 - a} = 4 * 10^b

Hmm, 4 is 2^2, so maybe I can write this as:

10^{2 - a} = 2^2 * 10^b

But I don't see an immediate way to combine these. Alternatively, perhaps I can take log base 10 of both sides.

Taking log10 of both sides:

log10(10^{2 - a}) = log10(4 * 10^b)

Left side: 2 - a.

Right side: log10(4) + log10(10^b) = log10(4) + b.

So,

2 - a = log10(4) + b

But from equation (6), b = 10a / 10^a.

So,

2 - a = log10(4) + (10a / 10^a)

Hmm, this is getting more complicated. Maybe I can plug in some integer values for a to see if it works. Since a is log x, and x >1, a must be positive.

Let me see, trying a = 2:

Then, b = (10*2)/10^2 = 20/100 = 0.2

So, b = 0.2

Then, equation (2 - a) = log10(4) + b becomes:

2 - 2 = log10(4) + 0.2 → 0 = approx 0.60206 + 0.2 → 0 ≈ 0.80206, which is not true.

So, a=2 doesn't work.

Trying a=1:

b = (10*1)/10^1 = 10 /10 = 1.

Then, equation becomes 2 -1 = log10(4) +1 → 1 = approx 0.60206 +1 → 1 ≈ 1.60206, which is also not true.

Hmm.

Trying a=3:

b = (10*3)/10^3 = 30 / 1000 = 0.03.

Equation: 2 -3 = log10(4) +0.03 → -1 ≈ 0.60206 +0.03 → -1≈0.63206, which is not true.

Hmm, maybe a=0.5:

b= (10*0.5)/10^0.5 = 5 / sqrt(10) ≈5/3.1623≈1.5811.

Equation: 2 -0.5 = log10(4) +1.5811 →1.5 ≈0.60206 +1.5811≈2.18316, which is not equal.

Hmm, maybe a= log10( something ). Wait, perhaps a= log10(2), so a≈0.3010.

Wait, a= log10(2) ≈0.3010.

Then, b=10a /10^a = 10*0.3010 /10^{0.3010}.

10^{0.3010} is approximately 2 because log10(2)=0.3010, so 10^{0.3010}=2.

So, b≈ (3.010)/2≈1.505.

Then, equation 2 - a ≈2 -0.3010=1.699.

log10(4)≈0.60206, so 0.60206 +1.505≈2.10706.

So, 1.699 ≈2.107? No, not really.

Hmm, this trial and error approach isn't working too well. Maybe I need a different method.

Wait, going back to the equations:

From equation (6): 10a = x b.

But x =10^a and b= log y.

Wait, maybe I need to find a relation between a and b.

Alternatively, let's think about the equations we have:

From equation (4a) and (5a):

10a = x b

10b =4y a

We can substitute x =10^a and y =10^b into these:

10a =10^a * b → equation (6)

10b =4*10^b *a → equation (7)

Let me try to write equation (6) as:

b = (10a)/10^a → b =10a e^{-a ln10}

Similarly, equation (7):

10b =4 a 10^b → 10b =4 a 10^b → b = (4 a 10^b)/10 → b= (4 a 10^{b})/10 → b= (2 a 10^{b})/5

Hmm, so from equation (6), b =10a e^{-a ln10}.

From equation (7), b= (2a/5) 10^b.

So, setting them equal:

10a e^{-a ln10} = (2a/5) 10^b

Assuming a ≠0, we can divide both sides by a:

10 e^{-a ln10} = (2/5) 10^b

Multiply both sides by 5:

50 e^{-a ln10} = 2 *10^b

Divide both sides by 2:

25 e^{-a ln10} =10^b

But 10^b is (e^{ln10})^b = e^{b ln10}, so:

25 e^{-a ln10} = e^{b ln10}

Take natural log of both sides:

ln25 + (-a ln10) = b ln10

So,

ln25 = (b + a) ln10

So,

ln25 / ln10 = a + b

But ln25 is ln(5^2)=2 ln5, so:

2 ln5 / ln10 = a + b

Hmm, 2 ln5 / ln10 is approximately 2*(0.6931)/(2.3026)≈ (1.3862)/(2.3026)≈0.60206.

Wait, that's exactly log10(4), since log10(4)=~0.60206.

So, a + b = log10(4)≈0.60206.

Wait, but earlier I had a + b = ln25 / ln10.

Wait, but ln25 is 2 ln5, so that gives 2 ln5 / ln10, which is log10(25)=log10(5^2)=2 log10(5)=2*(0.69897)=1.39794.

Wait, wait, wait. Wait, this is conflicting. Because ln25 / ln10 is log10(25)=1.39794, not 0.60206.

Wait, so earlier conclusion is wrong. Let me recheck.

Wait, I have ln25 = (b + a) ln10.

So, (a + b) = ln25 / ln10.

Which is log10(25). Because log10(25)=ln25 / ln10.

So, a + b = log10(25)=approx1.39794.

But earlier, when I tried a=log10(2)≈0.3010 and b=1.505, their sum was about 1.806, which is larger than log10(25)≈1.39794. So that trial didn't work.

Wait, perhaps I can write a + b = log10(25). So, a + b = log10(25).

But from equation (6) and (7), we have expressions for b in terms of a and vice versa.

From equation (6): b=10a /10^a.

From equation (7): b= (2a 10^b)/5.

So, setting them equal:

10a /10^a = (2a 10^b)/5

As done earlier, leading to a + b = log10(25)

Wait, but I'm just going in circles here. Maybe I can think of it differently.

Let me consider that a + b = log10(25) = 2 log10(5). So, a + b ≈1.39794.

But I also have:

From equation (6): b = (10a)/10^a.

So, substituting into a + b = log10(25):

a + (10a)/10^a = log10(25)

So,

a (1 + 10^{1 - a}) = log10(25)

Hmm, that's a transcendental equation. Maybe I can try to find a value of a that satisfies this.

Let me try a=1.

Left side: 1*(1 +10^{1-1})=1*(1+1)=2.

Right side: log10(25)=~1.39794. So, 2 ≈1.39794. No.

a=0.5.

Left side:0.5*(1 +10^{0.5})=0.5*(1 + sqrt(10))≈0.5*(1+3.1623)=0.5*(4.1623)=2.08115.

Right side: ~1.39794. Doesn't match.

a=1.5.

Left side:1.5*(1 +10^{-0.5})=1.5*(1 +0.3162)=1.5*1.3162≈1.9743.

Right side:1.39794. Doesn't match.

a=2.

Left side:2*(1 +10^{-1})=2*(1+0.1)=2*1.1=2.2.

Right side:1.39794. Still no.

Wait, what about a= log10(5). Since log10(25)=2 log10(5), which is log10(25).

So, a= log10(5)≈0.69897.

Then, a=0.69897.

Left side:0.69897*(1 +10^{1 -0.69897})=0.69897*(1 +10^{0.30103}).

10^{0.30103}=2, since log10(2)=0.30103.

So, left side:0.69897*(1 +2)=0.69897*3≈2.09691.

Which is larger than log10(25)=1.39794.

Hmm. Not matching.

Alternatively, maybe a= log10( sqrt(25) )= log10(5)=0.69897, but that didn't work.

Wait, perhaps a= log10( something else ). Maybe a=0. Let's try a=0. But a= log x, which is positive since x>1, so a>0. So, a=0 is not valid.

Hmm, maybe I can set t = a, then write the equation as t*(1 +10^{1 -t})= log10(25)=1.39794.

So,

t = 1.39794 / (1 +10^{1 -t})

This is an equation in t that I can try to solve numerically.

Let me try t=0.5:

Denominator:1 +10^{0.5}=1 +3.1623≈4.1623.

t=1.39794/4.1623≈0.336.

But I started with t=0.5. So, actually, t=0.336.

Now, let me take t=0.336 and compute denominator:

1 +10^{1 -0.336}=1 +10^{0.664}≈1 +4.64≈5.64.

t=1.39794/5.64≈0.2478.

Hmm, it's decreasing. Maybe try t=0.25.

Denominator:1 +10^{0.75}≈1 +5.6234≈6.6234.

t=1.39794/6.6234≈0.211.

So, t≈0.211.

Let me compute denominator again with t=0.211.

10^{1 -0.211}=10^{0.789}≈6.16.

Denominator:1 +6.16≈7.16.

t=1.39794 /7.16≈0.195.

Hmm, still decreasing. Let's go to t=0.195.

Denominator:1 +10^{1 -0.195}=1 +10^{0.805}=1 +6.36≈7.36.

t=1.39794/7.36≈0.190.

So, t≈0.190.

Compute denominator again with t=0.190.

10^{1 -0.190}=10^{0.81}≈6.56.

Denominator:1 +6.56=7.56.

t=1.39794/7.56≈0.1847.

Hmm, it's converging around t≈0.185.

Let me take t=0.185.

Denominator:1 +10^{0.815}=1 +10^{0.815}.

10^{0.815}= about 6.48.

So denominator=7.48.

t=1.39794/7.48≈0.1867.

Hmm, oscillating around t≈0.186.

So, t≈0.186.

Thus, a≈0.186.

So, a= log x ≈0.186 → x=10^{0.186}≈1.545.

Then, from equation (6), b=10a /10^a.

Compute 10a=10*0.186=1.86.

10^a=10^{0.186}=approx 1.545.

So, b=1.86 /1.545≈1.204.

So, b= log y≈1.204 → y=10^{1.204}≈15.75.

So, x≈1.545, y≈15.75.

Let me check if these approximate values satisfy the original equations.

First equation: log_x(y^x)=10.

Compute y^x:15.75^{1.545}.

15.75^1=15.75.

15.75^2=248.0625.

1.545 is between 1 and 2, so approx, say 15.75^(1.5)=sqrt(15.75^3).

15.75^3≈15.75*248.0625≈~3,910. So sqrt(3,910)=~62.5.

So, y^x≈62.5.

Then, log_x(62.5)=10 →x^10≈62.5.

Compute x^10: (1.545)^10.

1.545^2≈2.387.

1.545^4≈(2.387)^2≈5.70.

1.545^5≈1.545 *5.70≈8.86.

1.545^10≈(8.86)^2≈78.5.

But 62.5≠78.5. So, the first equation isn't satisfied. Hmm, that's a problem. Maybe my approximation is off.

Alternatively, perhaps I need a better approach.

Wait, perhaps instead of trying to solve for a and b, I can find a relationship between x and y.

From equation (1): x^10 = y^x.

From equation (2): y^10 =x^{4y}.

Let me take the first equation and raise both sides to the power of 10:

(x^10)^10 = (y^x)^10 → x^{100}= y^{10x}.

Similarly, the second equation is y^10 =x^{4y}.

So, from first raised to 10: x^{100}= y^{10x}.

Second equation: y^{10}=x^{4y}.

Now, let me write both x and y in terms of each other.

From equation (1): y= x^{10/x}.

Substitute this into the second equation.

So, equation (2): (x^{10/x})^{10} =x^{4y}.

Simplify left side: x^{100/x} =x^{4y}.

So, 100/x =4y.

But y= x^{10/x}.

So, 100/x =4 x^{10/x}.

Which is the same equation I had earlier.

Divide both sides by 4:25/x =x^{10/x}.

Hmm, 25/x =x^{10/x}.

Let me take the natural log of both sides:

ln(25/x) = (10/x) ln x.

Which is the same as earlier.

Hmm, perhaps I can set k= x^{10/x}.

Wait, but 25/x =k.

So, x=25/k.

But k= x^{10/x}= (25/k)^{10/(25/k)}.

Wait, that seems complicated.

Wait, 10/(25/k)=10*(k/25)= (10k)/25= (2k)/5.

So, k= (25/k)^{(2k)/5}.

Hmm, take both sides to the power of 5/(2k):

k^{5/(2k)}=25/k.

Hmm, not sure if that helps.

Alternatively, take logs:

ln k = (2k)/5 ln(25/k).

Hmm, but this seems even more complicated.

Wait, maybe it's better to make a substitution z = x^{1/x}.

Because x^{10/x}= (x^{1/x})^{10}=z^{10}.

So, from 25/x =x^{10/x}=z^{10}.

But z= x^{1/x}.

So, x= e^{ln x}.

Wait, perhaps setting t= x^{1/x}.

Then, t= e^{(ln x)/x} → ln t=(ln x)/x.

So, x= (ln t)^{-1} ln x. Hmm, not helpful.

Alternatively, perhaps let me set t =x^{1/x}, so ln t= (ln x)/x.

But I don't know if that helps.

Wait, perhaps I can find x such that x^{1/x} is a nice number.

Wait, x= e^k.

Then, t= e^{k/(e^k)}.

Hmm, not helpful.

Alternatively, perhaps trying specific x values.

Wait, when x=5:

x=5.

y=5^{10/5}=5^2=25.

Check equation (2): y^10=25^10.

x^{4y}=5^{4*25}=5^{100}.

But 25^10=(5^2)^10=5^{20}≠5^{100}. So, not equal.

Hmm.

x=25:

y=25^{10/25}=25^{0.4}=5^{2*0.4}=5^{0.8}≈3.311.

Check equation (2): y^10≈3.311^10≈ approx sqrt(3.311^20). Hmm, 3.311^2≈10.96, so 10.96^10≈ huge number, but x^{4y}=25^{4*3.311}=25^{13.244}=5^{26.488}, which is way bigger than y^10.

Not matching.

x= sqrt(10)= approx3.162.

y= (3.162)^{10/3.162}=3.162^{3.162}.

Wait, 3.162^3≈31.62, 3.162^0.162≈1.19. So, y≈31.62 *1.19≈37.67.

Check equation (2): y^10=37.67^10.

x^{4y}= (3.162)^{4*37.67}=(3.162)^{150.68}.

Which is way larger than 37.67^10. So, not matching.

Hmm, perhaps x=2.

y=2^{10/2}=2^5=32.

Check equation (2): y^10=32^10.

x^{4y}=2^{4*32}=2^{128}.

32^10= (2^5)^10=2^50.

Which is not equal to 2^128. So, no.

x=4:

y=4^{10/4}=4^{2.5}=sqrt(4^5)=sqrt(1024)=32.

Check equation (2): y^10=32^10.

x^{4y}=4^{4*32}=4^{128}= (2^2)^{128}=2^{256}.

32^10= (2^5)^10=2^{50}.

Not equal.

Hmm.

Wait, maybe x= y^{1/4}.

Wait, not sure. Alternatively, maybe try to see if x*y is a constant.

Wait, the problem is to find x*y. Maybe instead of finding x and y separately, find x*y.

Let me denote k= x*y.

I need to express equations in terms of k.

But not sure.

Wait, from equation (3): 100/x=4y → 25/x=y.

So, y=25/x.

So, k= x*y= x*(25/x)=25.

Wait, is that possible?

From equation (3): 100/x=4y → y=25/x.

So, x*y =x*(25/x)=25.

Wait, that seems too straightforward. Did I miss something?

Wait, equation (3) came from equating exponents after substitution. So, from equation (1) and (2), we get equation (3): 100/x=4y.

So, 25/x=y.

So, x*y= x*(25/x)=25.

So, the product x*y is 25? Hmm, that seems plausible.

But wait, I need to make sure that this is consistent with all the other equations.

So, if x*y=25, then y=25/x.

Substituting into equation (1):x^10=y^x=(25/x)^x.

So,

x^10= (25/x)^x → x^10=25^x /x^x →x^{10 +x}=25^x.

So,

x^{10 +x}=25^x.

Take natural log of both sides:

(10 +x) ln x =x ln25.

So,

10 ln x +x ln x =x ln25.

Rearranged:

10 ln x =x (ln25 - ln x).

But from equation (3), y=25/x, and from equation (1): y= x^{10/x}.

So,

25/x= x^{10/x}.

So, 25/x= x^{10/x}.

This is the same as equation (3), which is how we got y=25/x.

Wait, but if x*y=25, then xy=25 is the answer.

But let me confirm if this is possible.

Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake when I thought I had to go through all those steps, but in reality, equation (3) gives y=25/x, so x*y=25.

But let me make sure that this is consistent.

Wait, equation (3) is derived from the substitution of equations (1) and (2). So, if equation (3) is correct, then indeed x*y=25.

So, perhaps the answer is 25.

Wait, but let me check with the numbers I approximated earlier. x≈1.545, y≈15.75. Their product is ≈24.23, which is close to 25, but not exactly. So, maybe the exact answer is 25.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in earlier steps.

Wait, equation (1):x^10 = y^x.

Equation (2):y^10 =x^{4y}.

From equation (1):y= x^{10/x}.

Substituting into equation (2):

(x^{10/x})^10 =x^{4y} →x^{100/x}=x^{4y}.

So, 100/x=4y.

So, y=25/x.

Thus, x*y= x*(25/x)=25.

So, regardless of what x and y are, as long as they satisfy the given equations, their product is 25.

Therefore, the answer is 25.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To solve the problem, we start by converting the given logarithmic equations into exponential form:

1. \(\log_x(y^x) = 10\) implies \(x^{10} = y^x\).
2. \(\log_y(x^{4y}) = 10\) implies \(y^{10} = x^{4y}\).

From the first equation, we express \(y\) in terms of \(x\):

\[
y = x^{10/x}.
\]

Substituting this into the second equation:

\[
\left(x^{10/x}\right)^{10} = x^{4y}.
\]

Simplifying the left side:

\[
x^{100/x} = x^{4y}.
\]

Since the bases are the same, the exponents must be equal:

\[
\frac{100}{x} = 4y.
\]

From this, we find:

\[
y = \frac{25}{x}.
\]

Thus, the product \(xy\) is:

\[
xy = x \cdot \frac{25}{x} = 25.
\]

Therefore, the value of \(xy\) is \(\boxed{25}\).
