Okay, so I have this math problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again to make sure I understand.

The problem says: Let N be the greatest four-digit positive integer with the property that whenever one of its digits is changed to 1, the resulting number is divisible by 7. Then, Q and R are the quotient and remainder when N is divided by 1000. I need to find Q + R.

Hmm, okay. So N is a four-digit number, the largest possible, such that if you change any one of its digits to 1, the new number is divisible by 7. Then, I have to find Q + R where Q is the thousands digit (since dividing by 1000 gives the quotient as the thousands digit, and the remainder is the last three digits). Wait, no, actually, when you divide N by 1000, the quotient Q is the number formed by the first one or two digits? Wait, no. Let me think. For example, if N is 5000, then dividing by 1000 gives Q=5 and R=0. If N is 1234, then Q=1 and R=234. So, Q is the thousands place digit, and R is the last three digits. So Q is a single digit, and R is a three-digit number. Then Q + R would be like, for N=1234, 1 + 234 = 235. So, the problem is asking for the sum of the thousands digit and the last three digits of N.

But before I get there, I need to find N itself. So, what's the key property of N? Whenever one of its digits is changed to 1, the resulting number is divisible by 7.

Hmm. So, N is a four-digit number, say, with digits a, b, c, d. So, N = 1000a + 100b + 10c + d.

The property is that if I replace any digit (a, b, c, or d) with 1, the new number is divisible by 7. So, let's think about what that implies for N.

Let me denote the digits as D1, D2, D3, D4 (since it's a four-digit number, D1 is thousands place, D2 is hundreds, D3 is tens, D4 is units). So, N = D1 D2 D3 D4.

Now, when I replace D1 with 1, the number becomes 1 D2 D3 D4. Similarly, replacing D2 with 1: D1 1 D3 D4. Replacing D3 with 1: D1 D2 1 D4. Replacing D4 with 1: D1 D2 D3 1. Each of these numbers must be divisible by 7.

So, for each position i (1 to 4), replacing Di with 1 gives a number divisible by 7.

I need to find the maximum N (so largest possible four-digit number) with this property.

Let me think about the implications.

Suppose N is such a number. Then, for each digit Di, changing it to 1 gives a number divisible by 7. So, for each i, N with Di changed to 1 ≡ 0 mod 7.

But N itself may not be divisible by 7. So, let's write equations for each case.

Let me denote the original number as N = 1000*D1 + 100*D2 + 10*D3 + D4.

When we replace D1 with 1: 1000*1 + 100*D2 + 10*D3 + D4 = 1000 + 100*D2 + 10*D3 + D4. Let's call this number N1.

Similarly, replacing D2 with 1: 1000*D1 + 100*1 + 10*D3 + D4 = 1000*D1 + 100 + 10*D3 + D4. Let's call this N2.

Replacing D3 with 1: 1000*D1 + 100*D2 + 10*1 + D4 = 1000*D1 + 100*D2 + 10 + D4. Let's call this N3.

Replacing D4 with 1: 1000*D1 + 100*D2 + 10*D3 + 1. Let's call this N4.

Each of N1, N2, N3, N4 must be divisible by 7.

So, we can write:

N1 ≡ 0 mod 7

N2 ≡ 0 mod 7

N3 ≡ 0 mod 7

N4 ≡ 0 mod 7

Let me think of each case.

Let me express each of these in terms of N.

But perhaps it's better to express in terms of N and the digit changes.

Alternatively, perhaps we can find constraints on each digit.

Let me see.

First, let's compute N1 = 1000 + 100*D2 + 10*D3 + D4.

But N1 ≡ 0 mod 7.

Similarly, N = 1000*D1 + 100*D2 + 10*D3 + D4.

So, N1 = 1000 + 100*D2 + 10*D3 + D4.

But N = 1000*D1 + 100*D2 + 10*D3 + D4.

So, N1 = 1000 + (N - 1000*D1).

Which is N1 = N - 1000*D1 + 1000.

Similarly, we can write N1 = N + 1000*(1 - D1).

Since N1 is divisible by 7, N + 1000*(1 - D1) ≡ 0 mod 7.

But 1000 mod 7: Let's compute 1000 /7: 7*142=994, so 1000 ≡ 6 mod 7.

So, 1000 ≡ 6 mod7.

Therefore, N1 ≡ N + 6*(1 - D1) ≡ 0 mod7.

So, equation from N1: N + 6*(1 - D1) ≡ 0 mod7.

Similarly, let's compute the other cases.

Next, N2 = 100*D1 + 100 + 10*D3 + D4.

Wait, N2 = 1000*D1 + 100*1 + 10*D3 + D4.

Which is N2 = 1000 D1 + 100 + 10 D3 + D4.

But N = 1000 D1 + 100 D2 + 10 D3 + D4.

So, N2 = N - 100 D2 + 100.

So, N2 = N + 100*(1 - D2).

Again, since N2 ≡0 mod7, we have N + 100*(1 - D2) ≡0 mod7.

Compute 100 mod7: 100 /7=14*7=98, so 100≡2 mod7.

Thus, equation from N2: N + 2*(1 - D2) ≡0 mod7.

Similarly, let's do N3.

N3 = 1000 D1 + 100 D2 + 10 + D4.

Which is N3 = N - 10 D3 +10.

So, N3 = N + 10*(1 - D3).

Since N3 ≡0 mod7, equation: N +10*(1 - D3) ≡0 mod7.

10 mod7=3, so equation becomes N +3*(1 - D3) ≡0 mod7.

Similarly, N4 is 1000 D1 + 100 D2 + 10 D3 +1.

Which is N4 = N - D4 +1.

So, N4 = N + (1 - D4).

Thus, equation: N + (1 - D4) ≡0 mod7.

So, now, we have four equations:

1. N + 6*(1 - D1) ≡0 mod7.

2. N + 2*(1 - D2) ≡0 mod7.

3. N +3*(1 - D3) ≡0 mod7.

4. N + (1 - D4) ≡0 mod7.

So, these four equations must hold.

Let me write them as:

1. N ≡ -6*(1 - D1) mod7.

2. N ≡ -2*(1 - D2) mod7.

3. N ≡ -3*(1 - D3) mod7.

4. N ≡ -(1 - D4) mod7.

Since all four must be congruent to N mod7, all the right-hand sides must be congruent modulo7.

Therefore, the expressions -6*(1 - D1), -2*(1 - D2), -3*(1 - D3), -(1 - D4) must all be congruent mod7.

So, set all these equal to N mod7.

Therefore, we can write:

-6*(1 - D1) ≡ -2*(1 - D2) mod7.

Similarly,

-2*(1 - D2) ≡ -3*(1 - D3) mod7.

And,

-3*(1 - D3) ≡ -(1 - D4) mod7.

Hmm, that's a chain of congruences. Let's try to simplify these.

First, take the first pair:

-6*(1 - D1) ≡ -2*(1 - D2) mod7.

Multiply both sides by -1:

6*(1 - D1) ≡ 2*(1 - D2) mod7.

We can divide both sides by 2, since 2 and 7 are coprime, so 2 has an inverse mod7. The inverse of 2 mod7 is 4, because 2*4=8≡1 mod7.

So, multiply both sides by 4:

6*4*(1 - D1) ≡ 2*4*(1 - D2) mod7.

24*(1 - D1) ≡ 8*(1 - D2) mod7.

But 24 mod7: 7*3=21, so 24≡3 mod7; 8 mod7=1. So,

3*(1 - D1) ≡1*(1 - D2) mod7.

So,

3*(1 - D1) - (1 - D2) ≡0 mod7.

Let me expand that:

3 - 3 D1 -1 + D2 ≡0 mod7.

Simplify:

(3-1) + (-3 D1 + D2) ≡0 mod7.

2 + (-3 D1 + D2) ≡0 mod7.

So,

-3 D1 + D2 ≡ -2 mod7.

Multiply both sides by -1:

3 D1 - D2 ≡2 mod7.

So, equation (A): 3 D1 - D2 ≡2 mod7.

Similarly, take the next pair:

-2*(1 - D2) ≡ -3*(1 - D3) mod7.

Multiply both sides by -1:

2*(1 - D2) ≡3*(1 - D3) mod7.

Again, let's express this as:

2 - 2 D2 ≡3 - 3 D3 mod7.

Bring all terms to left:

2 -2 D2 -3 +3 D3 ≡0 mod7.

Simplify:

(-1) + (-2 D2 +3 D3) ≡0 mod7.

So,

-2 D2 +3 D3 ≡1 mod7.

Let me write this as equation (B): 3 D3 -2 D2 ≡1 mod7.

Now, take the next pair:

-3*(1 - D3) ≡ -(1 - D4) mod7.

Multiply both sides by -1:

3*(1 - D3) ≡1 - D4 mod7.

Which is:

3 -3 D3 ≡1 - D4 mod7.

Bring all terms to left:

3 -3 D3 -1 + D4 ≡0 mod7.

Simplify:

2 -3 D3 + D4 ≡0 mod7.

So,

-3 D3 + D4 ≡-2 mod7.

Multiply both sides by -1:

3 D3 - D4 ≡2 mod7.

Equation (C): 3 D3 - D4 ≡2 mod7.

So, now we have three equations:

(A): 3 D1 - D2 ≡2 mod7.

(B): 3 D3 -2 D2 ≡1 mod7.

(C): 3 D3 - D4 ≡2 mod7.

Additionally, from the four original equations, we can express N in terms of each digit. Let me see if I can find N mod7.

From equation 1:

N ≡ -6*(1 - D1) mod7.

Which is N ≡6*(D1 -1) mod7.

Similarly, from equation 2:

N ≡-2*(1 - D2)=2*(D2 -1) mod7.

From equation3:

N ≡-3*(1 - D3)=3*(D3 -1) mod7.

From equation4:

N ≡-(1 - D4)=D4 -1 mod7.

So, all these expressions must be congruent mod7.

Thus:

6*(D1 -1) ≡2*(D2 -1) ≡3*(D3 -1)≡ D4 -1 mod7.

So, perhaps we can express D2, D3, D4 in terms of D1.

From equation (A): 3 D1 - D2 ≡2 mod7.

So, D2 ≡3 D1 -2 mod7.

Similarly, from equation (B):3 D3 -2 D2 ≡1 mod7.

We can substitute D2 from above into this.

So, 3 D3 -2*(3 D1 -2) ≡1 mod7.

Let me compute:

3 D3 -6 D1 +4 ≡1 mod7.

So,

3 D3 -6 D1 ≡ -3 mod7.

Simplify:

3 D3 ≡6 D1 -3 mod7.

Divide both sides by 3 mod7. 3*5=15≡1 mod7, so inverse of 3 is 5.

So,

D3 ≡5*(6 D1 -3) mod7.

Compute 6 mod7=6, 3 mod7=3.

So,

D3 ≡5*(6 D1 -3) mod7.

Compute 5*6 D1=30 D1, 5*(-3)=-15.

30 mod7: 7*4=28, so 30≡2 mod7.

-15 mod7: 15/7=2*7=14, 15≡1 mod7, so -15≡-1 mod7≡6 mod7.

So,

D3 ≡2 D1 +6 mod7.

So, equation (D): D3 ≡2 D1 +6 mod7.

Similarly, from equation (C):3 D3 - D4 ≡2 mod7.

Substitute D3 from equation (D):

3*(2 D1 +6) - D4 ≡2 mod7.

Compute:

6 D1 +18 - D4 ≡2 mod7.

Simplify:

6 D1 +18 ≡ D4 +2 mod7.

Compute 18 mod7: 7*2=14, 18-14=4, so 18≡4 mod7.

Thus,

6 D1 +4 ≡ D4 +2 mod7.

Bring 2 to left:

6 D1 +4 -2 ≡ D4 mod7.

6 D1 +2 ≡ D4 mod7.

So,

D4 ≡6 D1 +2 mod7.

So, equation (E): D4 ≡6 D1 +2 mod7.

So, now, we can express D2, D3, D4 in terms of D1.

Let me summarize:

D2 ≡3 D1 -2 mod7. (from equation A)

D3 ≡2 D1 +6 mod7. (from equation D)

D4 ≡6 D1 +2 mod7. (from equation E)

Additionally, each digit is between 0 and 9, inclusive.

So, D1 is from 1 to9 (since it's a four-digit number), D2, D3, D4 from 0 to9.

But since we are looking for the greatest four-digit number, N, it's best to start with D1 as large as possible, which is 9, and see if it's possible, then 8, etc., until we find a solution.

So, let's try D1=9.

Compute D2, D3, D4 mod7.

From D1=9:

Compute D2 ≡3*9 -2 mod7.

3*9=27, 27 mod7: 7*3=21, 27-21=6, so 27≡6 mod7.

So, D2 ≡6 -2=4 mod7. So, D2 can be 4 or 11, but since D2 is a digit, 0-9, the possible values are 4 and 11, but 11 is invalid, so D2=4.

Similarly, D3 ≡2*9 +6 mod7.

2*9=18, 18 mod7=4 (since 7*2=14, 18-14=4).

So, D3 ≡4 +6=10 mod7=3.

So, D3 ≡3 mod7. So, D3 can be 3, 10, but since it's a digit, only 3 is valid.

Next, D4 ≡6*9 +2 mod7.

6*9=54. 54 mod7: 7*7=49, 54-49=5. So, 54≡5 mod7.

So, D4 ≡5 +2=7 mod7≡0 mod7.

So, D4 ≡0 mod7. So, possible D4 digits are 0 or 7.

Wait, D4 can be 0 or7 because 0≡0 mod7 and 7≡0 mod7.

So, if D4 is 0 or7.

But our goal is the largest possible N, so ideally, we want D4 to be as large as possible, so 7.

So, let me see:

If D1=9, D2=4, D3=3, D4=7.

So, N=9 4 3 7.

But let's check whether this N satisfies the original condition.

That is, changing each digit to 1 and checking if the new number is divisible by7.

Let me compute each modified number.

First, changing D1 to1: 1437.

Is 1437 divisible by7? Let's check.

7*205=1435. 1437-1435=2. So, 1437=7*205 +2. Not divisible by7.

So, this fails. Hence, N=9437 does not satisfy the condition.

Hmm, so perhaps my approach is incorrect? Because we derived the congruencies but perhaps the digits don't satisfy the original condition.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me check.

Wait, the four equations we derived are based on the digits mod7, but when I set D1=9, D2=4, D3=3, D4=7, the modified numbers might not satisfy the divisibility by7.

Therefore, perhaps I need to look for N where each of the modified numbers is exactly divisible by7, not just congruent mod7.

So, perhaps in addition to the congruence conditions, the actual values must be divisible by7.

Therefore, perhaps N=9437 doesn't satisfy the condition because when you change D1 to1, you get 1437, which is not divisible by7.

So, perhaps I need to adjust the digits so that not only do they satisfy the congruences, but also the modified numbers are exactly divisible by7.

Hmm, this complicates things.

Alternatively, perhaps I can model the problem differently.

Each of the modified numbers must be divisible by7, so N1, N2, N3, N4 are all multiples of7.

So, let's denote:

N1 = 1XYZ, where X is D2, Y is D3, Z is D4.

Similarly, N2 = X1YZ, N3 = XY1Z, N4 = XYZ1.

Each of these must be divisible by7.

Additionally, N is the original number, which is the largest possible four-digit number with this property.

So, perhaps I can think of N as ABCD, and when I replace any digit with1, I get a number divisible by7.

So, to maximize N, I should try to have the highest possible digits starting from the left.

So, I should try D1=9 first, then D2=9, etc., but ensuring that each modified number is divisible by7.

But this trial and error approach might be tedious, but perhaps manageable.

Wait, but perhaps a better approach is to use the congruence equations we derived earlier.

We have D1=9, D2=4, D3=3, D4=7.

But when we change D1 to1, we get 1437 which is not divisible by7. So, perhaps the issue is that the congruence conditions are necessary but not sufficient. So, perhaps we need to find N such that N1, N2, N3, N4 are all divisible by7, which may require that the modified numbers are exactly 0 mod7, not just that N satisfies certain congruence relations.

Alternatively, perhaps I need to consider that N must be such that N ≡ something mod7, but each modified number must be 0 mod7. So, perhaps N must be congruent to a specific value mod7, and each modified number must be 0.

Wait, let me think again.

We have N1 ≡0 mod7.

N1=1000 + 100 D2 +10 D3 + D4.

But N =1000 D1 + 100 D2 +10 D3 + D4.

So, N1 = N - (1000 D1 -1000).

So, N1 = N -1000(D1 -1).

Since N1 ≡0 mod7, and 1000≡6 mod7, so 1000(D1 -1)≡6(D1 -1) mod7.

So, N -6(D1 -1) ≡0 mod7.

Which implies N ≡6(D1 -1) mod7.

Similarly, from N2: N2=100 D1 +100 +10 D3 + D4.

N2 = N - (100 D2 -100).

So, N2 = N -100(D2 -1).

Since N2 ≡0 mod7, and 100≡2 mod7, so 100(D2 -1)≡2(D2 -1) mod7.

Hence, N -2(D2 -1) ≡0 mod7.

Thus, N ≡2(D2 -1) mod7.

Similarly, from N3: N3 =10 D1 +100 D2 +10 + D4.

N3 = N - (10 D3 -10).

So, N3 = N -10(D3 -1).

10≡3 mod7, so 10(D3 -1)≡3(D3 -1) mod7.

Thus, N -3(D3 -1)≡0 mod7.

So, N ≡3(D3 -1) mod7.

From N4: N4=1000 D1 +100 D2 +10 D3 +1.

N4 = N - (D4 -1).

So, N4 = N - (D4 -1).

Thus, N - (D4 -1) ≡0 mod7.

So, N ≡D4 -1 mod7.

Therefore, N must satisfy four congruencies:

1. N ≡6(D1 -1) mod7.

2. N ≡2(D2 -1) mod7.

3. N ≡3(D3 -1) mod7.

4. N ≡D4 -1 mod7.

So, all four expressions must be equal mod7.

So, 6(D1 -1) ≡2(D2 -1) ≡3(D3 -1) ≡D4 -1 mod7.

Earlier, we derived equations from this.

But when we set D1=9, we found D2=4, D3=3, D4=7, but that didn't satisfy the original condition.

So, perhaps D1=9 is not possible, or perhaps I need to adjust D4.

Wait, but D4 can be 0 or7, as per the congruence.

But let me think, perhaps the problem is that when we set D1=9, D4=7, but the modified number N4=9437 with D4 changed to1 is 9431.

Wait, no, N4 is changing D4 to1: 9431.

Wait, is 9431 divisible by7?

Let me compute 9431 /7.

7*1347=9429. 9431-9429=2. So, 9431 is 7*1347 +2. So, not divisible by7.

Hmm, so that's a problem.

So, perhaps our approach is missing something.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is that the digits D2, D3, D4 must satisfy not just their congruence mod7, but also that when we change them, the resulting number is exactly divisible by7, which is a stricter condition than just being 0 mod7.

Wait, but the congruence conditions should be sufficient, because if N1 is 0 mod7, it must be divisible by7.

Wait, but when we set D1=9, D2=4, D3=3, D4=7, then N1=1437, which is 1437 mod7: 1437 /7=205*7=1435. 1437-1435=2. So, 1437≡2 mod7, which is not 0. So, this suggests that our earlier approach is missing something.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that when we set D1=9, D2=4, D3=3, D4=7, the original N=9437, but N itself may not satisfy N ≡6(D1 -1) mod7.

Wait, let me compute N mod7. N=9437.

Compute 9437 mod7.

Calculate 9437 /7: 7*1348=9436, so 9437 ≡1 mod7.

Now, according to equation1: N ≡6(D1-1) mod7.

D1=9, D1-1=8. 6*8=48. 48 mod7=6, since 7*6=42, 48-42=6.

So, N should be ≡6 mod7.

But N=9437≡1 mod7, which is inconsistent.

So, that's a contradiction.

Hence, our initial assumption that D1=9 is valid is wrong. Therefore, D1 cannot be9.

Hmm, that's a problem.

Therefore, perhaps D1 cannot be9, so let's try D1=8.

So, D1=8.

Compute D2, D3, D4.

From equation A: D2 ≡3 D1 -2 mod7.

3*8=24, 24 mod7=3 (since 7*3=21, 24-21=3).

So, D2≡3 -2=1 mod7. So, D2 can be1 or8.

But D2 is a digit, so 1 or8.

Similarly, from equation D: D3≡2 D1 +6 mod7.

2*8=16, 16 mod7=2.

So, D3≡2 +6=8≡1 mod7.

So, D3≡1 mod7. So, possible D3=1 or8.

From equation E: D4≡6 D1 +2 mod7.

6*8=48, 48 mod7=6.

So, D4≡6 +2=8≡1 mod7.

So, D4≡1 mod7. So, D4=1 or8.

So, now, with D1=8, D2 can be1 or8, D3 can be1 or8, D4 can be1 or8.

But we need the largest possible N, so we should choose the largest possible digits.

So, let's try D2=8, D3=8, D4=8.

So, N=8 8 8 8.

Check if N=8888.

But let me check if changing any digit to1 gives a number divisible by7.

Changing D1 to1: 1888.

1888 /7: 7*269=1883, 1888-1883=5. Not divisible.

So, 1888 not divisible by7.

So, that fails.

So, N=8888 is invalid.

Next, let's try D2=8, D3=8, D4=8: same as above, but it's invalid.

Alternatively, perhaps D2=8, D3=8, D4=1.

N=8 8 8 1.

Check changing each digit:

Change D1 to1: 1881.

1881 /7: 7*268=1876, 1881-1876=5. Not divisible.

So, invalid.

Similarly, D2=8, D3=1, D4=8.

N=8 8 1 8.

Change D1 to1: 1818.

1818 /7: 7*259=1813, 1818-1813=5. Not divisible.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps D2=1, D3=1, D4=1.

N=8 1 1 1.

Check changing D1 to1: 1111.

1111 /7: 7*158=1106, 1111-1106=5. Not divisible.

So, that's no good.

Alternatively, perhaps D2=8, D3=1, D4=1.

N=8 8 1 1.

Change D1 to1:1811.

1811 /7: 7*258=1806, 1811-1806=5. Not divisible.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps D2=1, D3=8, D4=8.

N=8 1 8 8.

Change D1 to1:1188.

1188 /7: 7*169=1183, 1188-1183=5. Not divisible.

Hmm.

Wait, seems like with D1=8, no matter what D2, D3, D4 we choose (as per the congruence), N fails because the modified numbers are not divisible by7.

So, perhaps D1=8 is also invalid.

Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the congruence.

Wait, perhaps I should not just take the minimal solution for D2, D3, D4 but consider other possibilities.

Wait, when D1=8, D2≡1 mod7. So, D2 can be 1,8,15, etc. But since D2 is a digit, only 1 and8 are possible.

Similarly for D3 and D4.

So, perhaps try different combinations.

Wait, let's try D2=1, D3=1, D4=1.

So, N=8 1 1 1.

Check the modified numbers:

Changing D1 to1:1111. 1111/7=158.714... Not integer.

So, no.

Alternatively, D2=1, D3=1, D4=8.

N=8 1 1 8.

Change D1 to1:1118. 1118/7: 7*159=1113, 1118-1113=5. Not divisible.

Hmm.

Alternatively, D2=1, D3=8, D4=8.

N=8 1 8 8.

Change D1 to1:1188. 7*169=1183, 1188-1183=5. Not divisible.

Hmm.

Alternatively, D2=8, D3=1, D4=1.

N=8 8 1 1.

Change D1 to1:1811. 1811-7*258=1811-1806=5.

Not divisible.

So, perhaps D1=8 is invalid.

Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe D1=7.

So, let's set D1=7.

Compute D2, D3, D4.

From equation A: D2 ≡3*7 -2=21-2=19≡5 mod7.

So, D2≡5 mod7. So, possible D2=5 or12, but 12 is invalid. So, D2=5.

From equation D: D3≡2*7 +6=14+6=20≡6 mod7.

So, D3≡6 mod7. Possible D3=6 or13, but 13 invalid. So, D3=6.

From equation E: D4≡6*7 +2=42+2=44≡44-6*7=44-42=2 mod7.

So, D4≡2 mod7. So, D4=2 or9.

So, D4 can be 2 or9.

Since we want the largest N, we pick D4=9.

So, N=7 5 6 9.

Check if this satisfies the condition.

Change each digit to1:

1. Changing D1 to1:1569.

Check if 1569 divisible by7.

7*224=1568, so 1569-1568=1. So, not divisible.

Hmm, that fails.

So, perhaps N=7569 is invalid.

Wait, so let's try D4=2 instead.

So, N=7 5 6 2.

Check changing each digit to1:

Change D1 to1:1562.

1562/7: 7*223=1561, 1562-1561=1. Not divisible.

Hmm, same issue.

So, D1=7 doesn't seem to work.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the congruences.

Wait, let's compute N mod7 for N=7569.

Compute 7569 mod7.

Compute 7569 /7: 7*1081=7567. 7569-7567=2. So, 7569≡2 mod7.

Now, from equation1: N ≡6(D1 -1) mod7.

D1=7, so 6*(7-1)=6*6=36≡1 mod7.

So, N should be≡1 mod7, but N=7569≡2 mod7.

So, inconsistency.

Hmm, so perhaps D1=7 is invalid.

Wait, maybe I made a miscalculation in the congruence.

Wait, let me recheck.

From equation A: D2 ≡3 D1 -2 mod7.

D1=7: 3*7=21≡0 mod7. So, D2≡0 -2=5 mod7. So, D2=5 or12, which is correct.

From equation D: D3≡2 D1 +6 mod7.

2*7=14≡0 mod7. So, D3≡0 +6=6 mod7. So, D3=6 or13, correct.

From equation E: D4≡6 D1 +2 mod7.

6*7=42≡0 mod7. So, D4≡0 +2=2 mod7. So, D4=2,9.

So, that's correct.

But when we set N=7569, N≡2 mod7, but equation1 says N≡6(D1 -1)=6*6=36≡1 mod7. So, inconsistency.

So, N=7569 doesn't satisfy the congruence.

So, perhaps D1=7 is invalid.

Wait, perhaps I need to choose D1 such that all congruence conditions are satisfied.

Alternatively, perhaps I need to find D1 such that when we compute N, it satisfies all four congruence conditions.

Alternatively, perhaps I can model the problem as a system of equations.

Let me try to find D1, D2, D3, D4 such that:

1. 3 D1 - D2 ≡2 mod7.

2. 3 D3 -2 D2 ≡1 mod7.

3. 3 D3 - D4 ≡2 mod7.

And:

N=1000 D1 + 100 D2 +10 D3 + D4.

Additionally, when any digit is changed to1, the number is divisible by7.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps I can set up the following system:

From N1: 1000 + 100 D2 +10 D3 + D4 ≡0 mod7.

From N2: 1000 D1 + 100 +10 D3 + D4 ≡0 mod7.

From N3: 1000 D1 + 100 D2 +10 + D4 ≡0 mod7.

From N4: 1000 D1 + 100 D2 +10 D3 +1 ≡0 mod7.

So, we have four equations:

1. (1000 + 100 D2 +10 D3 + D4) ≡0 mod7.

2. (1000 D1 + 100 +10 D3 + D4) ≡0 mod7.

3. (1000 D1 + 100 D2 +10 + D4) ≡0 mod7.

4. (1000 D1 + 100 D2 +10 D3 +1) ≡0 mod7.

Let me compute each coefficient mod7.

1000 mod7=6, 100 mod7=2, 10 mod7=3, 1 mod7=1.

So, rewrite each equation:

1. 6 + 2 D2 +3 D3 + D4 ≡0 mod7.

2. 6 D1 +2 +3 D3 + D4 ≡0 mod7.

3. 6 D1 +2 D2 +3 D4 ≡0 mod7. Wait, no. Let me recheck.

Wait, equation3: 1000 D1 + 100 D2 +10 + D4.

So, mod7, this is 6 D1 + 2 D2 +3 + D4 ≡0 mod7.

Equation4:1000 D1 +100 D2 +10 D3 +1.

Mod7:6 D1 +2 D2 +3 D3 +1 ≡0 mod7.

So, equations:

1. 6 +2 D2 +3 D3 + D4 ≡0 mod7. (E1)

2.6 D1 +2 +3 D3 + D4 ≡0 mod7. (E2)

3.6 D1 +2 D2 +3 + D4 ≡0 mod7. (E3)

4.6 D1 +2 D2 +3 D3 +1 ≡0 mod7. (E4)

So, now, four equations.

Let me try to express variables in terms.

From E1: 6 +2 D2 +3 D3 + D4 ≡0 mod7.

From E2:6 D1 +2 +3 D3 + D4 ≡0 mod7.

Subtract E1 from E2:

(6 D1 +2 +3 D3 + D4) - (6 +2 D2 +3 D3 + D4) ≡0 mod7.

Simplify:

6 D1 +2 +3 D3 + D4 -6 -2 D2 -3 D3 - D4 ≡0 mod7.

So,

6 D1 -2 D2 + (2 -6) ≡0 mod7.

6 D1 -2 D2 -4 ≡0 mod7.

Which is,

6 D1 -2 D2 ≡4 mod7.

Divide both sides by2: 3 D1 - D2 ≡2 mod7.

Which is equation (A) we had earlier. So, consistent.

Similarly, let's subtract E3 from E2.

E2:6 D1 +2 +3 D3 + D4 ≡0 mod7.

E3:6 D1 +2 D2 +3 + D4 ≡0 mod7.

Subtract E3 from E2:

(6 D1 +2 +3 D3 + D4) - (6 D1 +2 D2 +3 + D4) ≡0 mod7.

Simplify:

6 D1 -6 D1 +2 -3 +3 D3 -2 D2 + D4 - D4 ≡0 mod7.

So,

-1 +3 D3 -2 D2 ≡0 mod7.

Which is,

3 D3 -2 D2 ≡1 mod7.

Which is equation (B). So, consistent.

Similarly, let's subtract E4 from E3.

E3:6 D1 +2 D2 +3 + D4 ≡0 mod7.

E4:6 D1 +2 D2 +3 D3 +1 ≡0 mod7.

Subtract E4 from E3:

(6 D1 +2 D2 +3 + D4) - (6 D1 +2 D2 +3 D3 +1) ≡0 mod7.

Simplify:

6 D1 -6 D1 +2 D2 -2 D2 +3 -1 + D4 -3 D3 ≡0 mod7.

So,

2 + D4 -3 D3 ≡0 mod7.

Which is,

D4 -3 D3 ≡-2 mod7≡5 mod7.

So,

D4 ≡3 D3 -2 mod7.

Which is similar to equation (C), which was 3 D3 - D4 ≡2 mod7, which is equivalent to D4 ≡3 D3 -2 mod7.

Hence, consistent.

Therefore, our earlier approach is correct.

But then, when I tried D1=9, got D2=4, D3=3, D4=0 or7, which didn't satisfy the condition.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that when I set D1=9, D4=7, but when you change D4 to1, you get N4=9431, which is not divisible by7.

But according to the problem, all four modified numbers must be divisible by7.

So, perhaps N=9437 is invalid because N4=9431 isn't divisible by7.

So, perhaps the issue is that when D4=7, N4=9431 must be divisible by7.

But 9431/7=1347.285..., which isn't an integer.

So, perhaps even though D4≡0 mod7, meaning D4=0 or7, but 7431 is not divisible by7.

Wait, but according to our earlier congruence, N4=9431 must be 0 mod7, but 9431≡9431 mod7.

Wait, 9431 divided by7: Let's compute 9431 /7.

7*1347=9429. 9431-9429=2. So, 9431≡2 mod7, which is not 0.

So, that's the problem.

So, perhaps the issue is that the congruence conditions are necessary but not sufficient.

So, perhaps I need to find N where not only the digits satisfy the congruence, but also the modified numbers are exactly divisible by7.

So, perhaps I need to find N such that:

1. N1=1000 + 100 D2 +10 D3 + D4 is divisible by7.

2. N2=1000 D1 + 100 +10 D3 + D4 is divisible by7.

3. N3=1000 D1 + 100 D2 +10 + D4 is divisible by7.

4. N4=1000 D1 + 100 D2 +10 D3 +1 is divisible by7.

So, perhaps I can model this as a system where N1, N2, N3, N4 are all multiples of7, and find the largest N=1000 D1 +100 D2 +10 D3 + D4.

This seems a bit involved, but perhaps manageable.

Alternatively, perhaps I can find N such that N1, N2, N3, N4 are multiples of7, and N is the largest such four-digit number.

Let me think about how to maximize N.

Since N is a four-digit number, the largest possible is9999, but it must satisfy the condition.

So, perhaps I can start from9999 and go downwards, checking each number to see if it satisfies the condition.

But this might take a long time, but perhaps manageable.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use the congruence conditions to find the digits.

Alternatively, perhaps considering that N must be such that N1, N2, N3, N4 are all multiples of7.

So, N1=1 D2 D3 D4 must be divisible by7.

Similarly, N2=D1 1 D3 D4 must be divisible by7.

N3=D1 D2 1 D4 must be divisible by7.

N4=D1 D2 D3 1 must be divisible by7.

So, perhaps I can write each of these numbers as N1, N2, N3, N4, which are all divisible by7.

Let me denote:

N1 = 1000 + 100 D2 +10 D3 + D4.

N2 = 1000 D1 + 100 +10 D3 + D4.

N3 = 1000 D1 + 100 D2 +10 + D4.

N4 = 1000 D1 + 100 D2 +10 D3 +1.

We can write each of these as:

N1 = 1000 + 100 D2 +10 D3 + D4.

N2 = 100*(10 D1 +1) + 10 D3 + D4.

N3 = 1000 D1 + 100 D2 + 10 + D4.

N4 = 1000 D1 + 100 D2 +10 D3 +1.

Each of these must be divisible by7.

So, perhaps I can express N1, N2, N3, N4 in terms of N.

Wait, N = 1000 D1 +100 D2 +10 D3 + D4.

So, N1 = 1000 +100 D2 +10 D3 + D4 = 1000 + (N - 1000 D1).

Similarly, N1 = N -1000(D1 -1).

Similarly, N2 = 1000 D1 +100 +10 D3 + D4 = 1000 D1 +100 +10 D3 + D4 = N -100 D2 +100.

So, N2 = N -100(D2 -1).

Similarly, N3 = 1000 D1 +100 D2 +10 + D4 = N -10 D3 +10.

N3 = N -10(D3 -1).

N4 = 1000 D1 +100 D2 +10 D3 +1 = N - D4 +1.

So, N4 = N - (D4 -1).

Since each of N1, N2, N3, N4 must be divisible by7, we can write:

N -1000(D1 -1) ≡0 mod7.

N -100(D2 -1) ≡0 mod7.

N -10(D3 -1) ≡0 mod7.

N - (D4 -1) ≡0 mod7.

Which, as before, gives:

N ≡1000(D1 -1) mod7.

N ≡100(D2 -1) mod7.

N ≡10(D3 -1) mod7.

N ≡(D4 -1) mod7.

But since 1000≡6 mod7, 100≡2 mod7, 10≡3 mod7, 1≡1 mod7.

So,

N ≡6(D1 -1) mod7.

N ≡2(D2 -1) mod7.

N ≡3(D3 -1) mod7.

N ≡D4 -1 mod7.

So, all four expressions must be congruent mod7.

Therefore, 6(D1 -1) ≡2(D2 -1) ≡3(D3 -1)≡D4 -1 mod7.

So, earlier, we derived:

3 D1 - D2 ≡2 mod7.

3 D3 -2 D2 ≡1 mod7.

3 D3 - D4 ≡2 mod7.

So, we can use these equations to express D2, D3, D4 in terms of D1.

From equation (A): D2 ≡3 D1 -2 mod7.

From equation (B): 3 D3 ≡2 D2 +1 mod7.

Substituting D2 from (A): 3 D3 ≡2*(3 D1 -2) +1 mod7.

Compute:

3 D3 ≡6 D1 -4 +1 ≡6 D1 -3 mod7.

Multiply both sides by5 (inverse of3 mod7):

D3 ≡5*(6 D1 -3) mod7.

Compute:

5*6=30≡2 mod7.

5*(-3)= -15≡-15+21=6 mod7.

So,

D3 ≡2 D1 +6 mod7.

Similarly, from equation (C):3 D3 - D4 ≡2 mod7.

Substitute D3:

3*(2 D1 +6) - D4 ≡2 mod7.

Compute:

6 D1 +18 - D4 ≡2 mod7.

18 mod7=4, so,

6 D1 +4 - D4 ≡2 mod7.

So,

6 D1 +4 -2 ≡ D4 mod7.

6 D1 +2 ≡ D4 mod7.

So,

D4 ≡6 D1 +2 mod7.

So, now, we have:

D2 ≡3 D1 -2 mod7.

D3 ≡2 D1 +6 mod7.

D4 ≡6 D1 +2 mod7.

Each digit must be between0-9, so let's find D1 (1-9) such that D2, D3, D4 are valid digits.

So, let's tabulate possible D1 from9 down to1, compute D2, D3, D4, and then check if the modified numbers N1, N2, N3, N4 are divisible by7.

Let's start with D1=9.

D1=9:

D2=3*9 -2=27-2=25≡25 mod7=4 (since 7*3=21, 25-21=4). So, D2=4.

D3=2*9 +6=18+6=24≡24 mod7=3 (24-21=3). So, D3=3.

D4=6*9 +2=54+2=56≡56 mod7=0. So, D4=0 or7.

So, D4 can be0 or7.

So, possible N with D1=9:

Case1: D4=7.

N=9 4 3 7.

Check modified numbers:

N1=1 4 3 7=1437.

1437/7=205.285..., which is 7*205=1435, 1437-1435=2. Not divisible.

So, N1 invalid.

Case2: D4=0.

N=9 4 3 0.

Check modified numbers:

N1=1430.

1430/7=204.285..., 7*204=1428, 1430-1428=2. Not divisible.

So, N1 invalid.

Thus, D1=9 invalid.

Next, D1=8.

D1=8:

D2=3*8 -2=24-2=22≡22 mod7=1 (22-21=1). So, D2=1 or8.

D3=2*8 +6=16+6=22≡1 mod7. So, D3=1 or8.

D4=6*8 +2=48+2=50≡50 mod7=1 (50-49=1). So, D4=1 or8.

So, possible N with D1=8:

We need to choose D2, D3, D4 as 1 or8, but to maximize N, we choose the largest possible digits.

So, try D2=8, D3=8, D4=8: N=8 8 8 8.

Check modified numbers:

N1=1888.

1888/7=269.714..., 7*269=1883, 1888-1883=5. Not divisible.

So, invalid.

Next, D2=8, D3=8, D4=1: N=8 8 8 1.

Check N1:1881.

1881/7=268.714..., 7*268=1876, 1881-1876=5. Not divisible.

Invalid.

Next, D2=8, D3=1, D4=8: N=8 8 1 8.

Check N1=1818.

1818/7=259.714..., 7*259=1813, 1818-1813=5. Not divisible.

Invalid.

Next, D2=8, D3=1, D4=1: N=8 8 1 1.

N1=1811.

1811/7=258.714..., 7*258=1806, 1811-1806=5. Not divisible.

Invalid.

Next, D2=1, D3=8, D4=8: N=8 1 8 8.

N1=1188.

1188/7=169.714..., 7*169=1183, 1188-1183=5. Not divisible.

Invalid.

Next, D2=1, D3=8, D4=1: N=8 1 8 1.

N1=1181.

1181/7=168.714..., 7*168=1176, 1181-1176=5. Not divisible.

Invalid.

Next, D2=1, D3=1, D4=8: N=8 1 1 8.

N1=1118.

1118/7=159.714..., 7*159=1113, 1118-1113=5. Not divisible.

Invalid.

Next, D2=1, D3=1, D4=1: N=8 1 1 1.

N1=1111.

1111/7=158.714..., 7*158=1106, 1111-1106=5. Not divisible.

Invalid.

So, D1=8 is invalid.

Next, D1=7.

D1=7:

D2=3*7 -2=21-2=19≡19 mod7=5. So, D2=5.

D3=2*7 +6=14+6=20≡20 mod7=6. So, D3=6.

D4=6*7 +2=42+2=44≡44 mod7=2. So, D4=2 or9.

So, D4=9 is better to maximize N.

So, N=7 5 6 9.

Check modified numbers:

N1=1569.

1569/7=224.142..., 7*224=1568, 1569-1568=1. Not divisible.

Invalid.

Next, D4=2: N=7 5 6 2.

Check N1=1562.

1562/7=223.142..., 7*223=1561, 1562-1561=1. Not divisible.

Invalid.

Thus, D1=7 invalid.

Next, D1=6.

D1=6:

D2=3*6 -2=18-2=16≡16 mod7=2. So, D2=2 or9.

D3=2*6 +6=12+6=18≡18 mod7=4. So, D3=4 or11 (invalid).

D4=6*6 +2=36+2=38≡38 mod7=3 (38-35=3). So, D4=3 or10 (invalid). So, D4=3.

So, to maximize N, set D2=9, D3=4, D4=3.

N=6 9 4 3.

Check modified numbers:

N1=1943.

1943/7=277.571..., 7*277=1939, 1943-1939=4. Not divisible.

Invalid.

Alternatively, D2=2, D3=4, D4=3: N=6 2 4 3.

N1=1243.

1243/7=177.571..., 7*177=1239, 1243-1239=4. Not divisible.

Invalid.

So, D1=6 invalid.

Next, D1=5.

D1=5:

D2=3*5 -2=15-2=13≡13 mod7=6. So, D2=6 or13 (invalid).

D3=2*5 +6=10+6=16≡16 mod7=2. So, D3=2 or9.

D4=6*5 +2=30+2=32≡32 mod7=4. So, D4=4 or11 (invalid).

To maximize N, set D2=6, D3=9, D4=4.

N=5 6 9 4.

Check modified numbers:

N1=1694.

1694/7=242 exactly, since 7*242=1694. So, N1 divisible by7.

Good.

Check N2=5194.

5194/7=742 exactly, since 7*742=5194. So, N2 divisible by7.

Good.

Check N3=5644.

5644/7=806.285... 7*806=5642, 5644-5642=2. Not divisible.

So, N3 invalid.

Thus, N=5694 invalid.

Alternatively, perhaps D3=2, D4=4.

N=5 6 2 4.

Check modified numbers:

N1=1624.

1624/7=232 exactly, since 7*232=1624. Good.

N2=5124.

5124/7=732 exactly, since 7*732=5124. Good.

N3=5624.

5624/7=803.428..., 7*803=5621, 5624-5621=3. Not divisible.

Invalid.

Thus, D1=5 invalid.

Next, D1=4.

D1=4:

D2=3*4 -2=12-2=10≡10 mod7=3. So, D2=3 or10 (invalid).

D3=2*4 +6=8+6=14≡14 mod7=0. So, D3=0 or7.

D4=6*4 +2=24+2=26≡26 mod7=5. So, D4=5 or12 (invalid).

To maximize N, set D2=3, D3=7, D4=5.

N=4 3 7 5.

Check modified numbers:

N1=1375.

1375/7=196.428..., 7*196=1372, 1375-1372=3. Not divisible.

Invalid.

Alternatively, D3=0, D4=5.

N=4 3 0 5.

N1=1305.

1305/7=186.428..., 7*186=1302, 1305-1302=3. Not divisible.

Invalid.

Thus, D1=4 invalid.

Next, D1=3.

D1=3:

D2=3*3 -2=9-2=7≡7 mod7=0. So, D2=0 or7.

D3=2*3 +6=6+6=12≡12 mod7=5. So, D3=5 or12 (invalid).

D4=6*3 +2=18+2=20≡20 mod7=6. So, D4=6 or13 (invalid).

To maximize N, set D2=7, D3=5, D4=6.

N=3 7 5 6.

Check modified numbers:

N1=1756.

1756/7=250.857..., 7*250=1750, 1756-1750=6. Not divisible.

Invalid.

Alternatively, D2=0, D3=5, D4=6.

N=3 0 5 6.

N1=1056.

1056/7=150.857..., 7*150=1050, 1056-1050=6. Not divisible.

Invalid.

Thus, D1=3 invalid.

Next, D1=2.

D1=2:

D2=3*2 -2=6-2=4≡4 mod7=4. So, D2=4.

D3=2*2 +6=4+6=10≡10 mod7=3. So, D3=3 or10 (invalid).

D4=6*2 +2=12+2=14≡14 mod7=0. So, D4=0 or7.

To maximize N, set D2=4, D3=3, D4=7.

N=2 4 3 7.

Check modified numbers:

N1=1437.

1437/7=205.285..., 7*205=1435, 1437-1435=2. Not divisible.

Invalid.

Alternatively, D4=0.

N=2 4 3 0.

N1=1430.

1430/7=204.285..., 7*204=1428, 1430-1428=2. Not divisible.

Invalid.

Thus, D1=2 invalid.

Finally, D1=1.

D1=1:

D2=3*1 -2=3-2=1≡1 mod7=1. So, D2=1.

D3=2*1 +6=2+6=8≡8 mod7=1. So, D3=1 or8.

D4=6*1 +2=6+2=8≡8 mod7=1. So, D4=1 or8.

To maximize N, set D2=1, D3=8, D4=8.

N=1 1 8 8.

Check modified numbers:

N1=1188.

1188/7=169.714..., 7*169=1183, 1188-1183=5. Not divisible.

Invalid.

Alternatively, D3=1, D4=8.

N=1 1 1 8.

N1=1118.

1118/7=159.714..., 7*159=1113, 1118-1113=5. Not divisible.

Invalid.

Thus, D1=1 invalid.

Wait, so none of the D1 from1 to9 gives a valid N where all modified numbers are divisible by7.

But the problem says that such a number exists, so perhaps I made a mistake in calculations.

Wait, perhaps I missed some possibilities in D1=5.

Earlier, when D1=5, N=5 6 9 4.

We saw that N3=5644, which is 5644/7=806.285..., which is not divisible.

But wait, perhaps I miscalculated.

Wait, 7*806=5642, 5644-5642=2. So, not divisible.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the digits.

Wait, when D1=5, D2=6, D3=9, D4=4.

N=5694.

Check N1=1694. 1694/7=242, which is exact. Good.

N2=5194. 5194/7=742, exact. Good.

N3=5644. 5644/7=806.285..., which is not exact.

But wait, perhaps I made a mistake in constructing N3.

N3 is changing D3 to1: D1 D2 1 D4=5 6 1 4=5614.

Wait, wait, no, N3 is changing D3 to1, so N3=5 6 1 4=5614.

Wait, earlier I thought it was 5644, but no, that's incorrect.

Wait, changing D3 from9 to1: N3=5 6 1 4=5614.

Check 5614/7=802, since 7*800=5600, 7*2=14, so 7*802=5614.

Yes, that's exact.

Wait, I think I made a mistake earlier when calculating N3.

So, N3=5614, which is divisible by7.

Similarly, N4=5691.

Wait, N4 is changing D4 to1: N4=5 6 9 1=5691.

Check 5691/7=813, since 7*800=5600, 7*13=91, so 7*813=5691. Yes, divisible.

So, N=5694 is valid.

Wait, earlier I thought N3 was5644, but no, it's5614.

So, N=5694 is valid.

But wait, is this the largest possible N?

Earlier, I tried D1=5, got N=5694.

But wait, perhaps there are larger N with D1=5.

Wait, let's see, D1=5, D2=6, D3=9, D4=4.

Alternatively, D4=9, but D4≡2 mod7, so D4=2 or9. Wait, for D1=5, D4=6*5 +2=32≡4 mod7, so D4=4 or11, which is invalid.

Wait, no, earlier calculations for D1=5: D4≡6*5 +2=32≡4 mod7, so D4=4 or11. So, D4=4.

Thus, N=5 6 9 4.

But wait, D3=9, which is allowed since D3=2*5 +6=16≡2 mod7, so D3=2 or9. So, choosing D3=9.

Thus, N=5 6 9 4.

Which is5694.

Now, let me check all modified numbers:

N1=1 6 9 4=1694.

1694/7=242, exact.

N2=5 1 9 4=5194.

5194/7=742, exact.

N3=5 6 1 4=5614.

5614/7=802, exact.

N4=5 6 9 1=5691.

5691/7=813, exact.

So, all four modified numbers are divisible by7.

So, N=5694 is a valid number.

Is this the largest possible?

Wait, when D1=5, we have N=5694.

But earlier, when D1=6, I tried N=6943, but that didn't work.

Wait, perhaps I missed a higher N with D1=6.

Wait, D1=6: D2=2 or9.

D3=4 or11 (invalid). So, D3=4.

D4=3 or10 (invalid). So, D4=3.

So, N=6 9 4 3.

But N1=1943, which is not divisible.

But wait, is there another possibility?

Wait, D2=9, D3=4, D4=3: N=6 9 4 3.

Check N1=1943.

1943/7=277.571..., which isn't exact.

But wait, perhaps D4 can be another value?

Wait, D4=6 D1 +2=6*6 +2=38≡38 mod7=3. So, D4=3 or10.

So, only 3 is valid.

Thus, N=6943 is invalid.

So, the next possible N is5694.

But wait, perhaps there's a larger N with D1=5.

Wait, D1=5, D2=6, D3=9, D4=4: 5694.

Alternatively, if D2=6, D3=2, D4=4: N=5 6 2 4=5624.

But 5624 is less than5694.

So, 5694 is larger.

So, is 5694 the maximum?

Wait, let's check D1=5, D2=6, D3=9, D4=4.

Is there a way to make D4=9? Wait, D4=6*5 +2=32≡4 mod7. So, D4=4 or11, which is invalid. So, D4=4 is the only option.

Thus, N=5694 is the largest possible.

Wait, but let me check if there's a larger N with D1=5.

Wait, D2=6 is the maximum possible for D2 when D1=5.

Yes, because D2=6 is the maximum digit for D2 when D1=5.

So, N=5694 is the maximum.

Wait, but let's check if N=5994 satisfies the condition.

Wait, N=5994.

But according to our earlier equations, when D1=5, D2=6, D3=9, D4=4.

So, N=5694 is the maximum.

So, the answer is N=5694.

Wait, but let me confirm once more.

Compute N=5694.

Check modified numbers:

N1=1694: 1694/7=242, exact.

N2=5194:5194/7=742, exact.

N3=5614:5614/7=802, exact.

N4=5691:5691/7=813, exact.

So, all modified numbers are divisible by7.

Thus, N=5694 is valid.

Now, the problem asks for Q and R when N is divided by1000.

N=5694.

Divide by1000: Q=5, R=694.

Thus, Q + R=5 +694=699.

Wait, but wait: 5694 divided by1000 is5 with remainder694.

Thus, Q=5, R=694.

So, Q + R=5 +694=699.

But wait, is N=5694 the largest possible?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier.

Wait, when D1=5, D2=6, D3=9, D4=4: N=5694.

But perhaps there's a larger N with D1=5, like5994.

Wait, but according to our earlier equations, when D1=5, D2=6, D3=9, D4=4.

So, D3=9 is allowed because D3=2 D1 +6=16≡2 mod7, so D3=2 or9. So, choosing D3=9.

But D4=6 D1 +2=32≡4 mod7, so D4=4.

Thus, N=5694.

But wait, N=5994 would require D2=9, but when D1=5, D2=3*5 -2=13≡6 mod7. So, D2=6 or13 (invalid). So, D2=6.

Thus, N=5 6 9 4=5694.

So, N=5694 is the maximum.

So, the answer is Q + R=5 +694=699.

Wait, but the problem says "the greatest four-digit positive integer". So, 5694 is a four-digit number, but perhaps there exists a larger N, say, 7000-something.

Wait, let's see.

Wait, earlier when D1=7, we tried N=7569, which didn't work because N1 wasn't divisible by7.

But perhaps another N with D1=7 could work.

Wait, D1=7:

D2=3*7 -2=19≡5 mod7, so D2=5.

D3=2*7 +6=20≡6 mod7, so D3=6.

D4=6*7 +2=44≡2 mod7, so D4=2 or9.

So, N=7 5 6 9.

Check modified numbers:

N1=1569.

1569/7=224.142..., which is not exact.

But wait, perhaps if D4=9, N=7569.

But N1=1569 is not divisible by7.

Alternatively, perhaps D4=2: N=7562.

Check N1=1562.

1562/7=223.142..., which is not exact.

Thus, D1=7 invalid.

So, N=5694 is the maximum.

Thus, the answer is Q + R=5 +694=699.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The greatest four-digit number \( N \) satisfying the given condition is 5694. When \( N \) is divided by 1000, the quotient \( Q \) is 5 and the remainder \( R \) is 694. Therefore, \( Q + R = 5 + 694 = 699 \).

\boxed{699}
