Okay, so I have this math problem to solve. It says: Let p be the least prime number for which there exists a positive integer n such that n⁴ + 1 is divisible by p². Then I need to find the least positive integer m such that m⁴ + 1 is divisible by p². Hmm, okay. Let me try to break this down.

First, I need to find the smallest prime p where p² divides n⁴ + 1 for some positive integer n. Once I find that p, I have to find the smallest m where m⁴ +1 is divisible by p².

I remember that for primes p, if p divides a⁴ +1, then certain conditions must hold. I think primes dividing a⁴ +1 must be of the form 8k +1 because a⁴ ≡ -1 mod p. Let me check that.

If a⁴ ≡ -1 mod p, then raising both sides to the power of 2 gives a^8 ≡ 1 mod p. So the order of a modulo p divides 8. But since a^4 ≡ -1 mod p, the order can't be 4 because then a^4 ≡ 1 mod p, which contradicts a^4 ≡ -1 mod p. Therefore, the order must be 8. By Fermat's little theorem, the order of a modulo p must divide p-1. Therefore, 8 divides p-1, which implies p ≡ 1 mod 8. So primes p ≡ 1 mod 8 can divide numbers of the form a⁴ +1.

But wait, the problem is about p² dividing n⁴ +1. So we need primes where not only p divides n⁴ +1, but p² also does. I think these are called Wieferich primes, but I'm not sure. Or maybe they're called something else. I remember that primes where p² divides a^{p-1} -1 are Wieferich primes, which are rare.

But here, it's about n⁴ +1. So perhaps I need to find primes p ≡ 1 mod 8 where p² divides some n⁴ +1.

I think I need to check small primes p ≡1 mod8 and see if p² divides n⁴ +1 for some n. The primes p ≡1 mod8 are 17, 97, 113, etc. Wait, the smallest such primes are 17, 97, 113, 193, and so on. Let me check p=17 first.

So for p=17, does there exist n such that n⁴ ≡ -1 mod 17²=289? Let me try to find such an n.

First, let's see if n⁴ +1 ≡0 mod17. Because if n⁴ ≡-1 mod17, then maybe it can be lifted to mod289 using Hensel's lemma.

So modulo 17, n⁴ ≡-1. Let's find n such that n⁴ ≡16 mod17.

We can compute n from 1 to 8 to see which satisfy n⁴ ≡16 mod17.

Compute 1⁴=1 mod17 → 1, not 16.

2⁴=16 mod17. Oh, 2⁴=16 which is -1 mod17. So n=2 is a solution.

Similarly, 15⁴ would be (-2)^4=16 mod17, so n=15 is another solution.

So n=2 and n=15 satisfy n⁴ ≡-1 mod17. Now, does there exist a solution mod289?

To check if 2 can be lifted to a solution mod289, we can use Hensel's lemma. Since the derivative of f(n)=n⁴ +1 is f’(n)=4n³. At n=2, f’(2)=4*(8)=32 mod17. 32 mod17 is 15, which is not zero. Therefore, Hensel's lemma applies, and there exists a unique lift of n=2 mod17 to a solution mod289.

So n=2 +17k. Let me compute n⁴ +1 mod289.

Let me compute n=2 first: 2⁴ +1=16+1=17, which is 17 mod289, not 0.

So, let's compute (2 + 17k)^4 +1 mod289. Maybe find k such that this is 0.

But this might be tedious. Alternatively, can we solve n⁴ ≡ -1 mod289?

Alternatively, perhaps 2 is a primitive root modulo 17, but I'm not sure. Wait, 2^4=16≡-1 mod17, so 2 has order 8 mod17. Since 8 divides 16 (phi(17)=16), that's consistent.

But for mod289, which is 17², things are more complicated. Let me see if 2 can be lifted.

I can follow Hensel's lemma steps. Let me set n = 2 + 17t, where t is an integer we need to find.

Compute f(n) = n⁴ +1.

f(2) = 17, which is 17 mod289.

Compute f(n) - f(2) ≈ f’(2)*(n -2) mod17².

Wait, f’(2) = 4*(2)^3=32.

So, f(n) ≈ f(2) + f’(2)*(n-2) mod289.

So, set f(n)=0 mod289: 17 +32*(n-2) ≡0 mod289.

So 32*(n-2) ≡ -17 mod289.

Compute 32*(n-2) ≡ 272 mod289.

Wait, because -17 mod289 is 272.

So, 32*(n-2) ≡272 mod289.

Divide both sides by GCD(32,289). Since 289 is 17², and 32 is 2^5, so GCD is 1. Therefore, 32 has an inverse mod289.

Compute inverse of 32 mod289.

We can use the extended Euclidean algorithm.

Find x such that 32x ≡1 mod289.

Let me compute:

289 = 9*32 + 1 (since 9*32=288, 289-288=1).

So, 1=289 -9*32.

Therefore, inverse of 32 is -9 mod289, which is 280.

So, x=280.

Thus, n-2 ≡272 *280 mod289.

Compute 272*280 mod289.

But 272 is -17 mod289, 280 is -9 mod289.

So, (-17)*(-9)=153 mod289.

So, n-2 ≡153 mod289.

Thus, n=2 +153=155 mod289.

Wait, but 2 +153=155. Let me check if 155⁴ +1 is divisible by 289.

Compute 155 mod17: 155 /17=9*17=153, so 155≡2 mod17, which is consistent.

Compute 155^2: 155²=24025.

Divide 24025 by289: 289*83=24047, which is larger than 24025. Let me compute 289*82=289*(80+2)=23120 + 578=23698. 24025-23698=327. 289*1=289, 327-289=38, so 24025=289*82 +327. 327 is less than 289? Wait, 327=289+38, so 24025=289*(82+1)+38=289*83 +38.

So 155²≡38 mod289.

Then compute 155^4=(155²)^2≡38²=1444 mod289.

Compute 1444 divided by289: 289*4=1156, 1444-1156=288. So 1444≡288 mod289.

Thus, 155^4 +1 ≡288 +1=289≡0 mod289. Oh, that works! So 155 is a solution. So n=155 is the solution mod289.

But wait, 155 is a positive integer. However, the problem is to find the least positive integer m such that m⁴ +1 is divisible by p². Since p=17 is the smallest prime where p² divides some n⁴ +1, then m would be 155? Or maybe there's a smaller m for p=17.

Wait, 155 is the solution I found, but perhaps there exists a smaller m.

Wait, the solutions mod289 would be 155 and its additive inverse. Let me see, 155 mod289 is 155, and the other solution would be -155 mod289, which is 134. So 134 is another solution. So 134 is smaller than 155, so maybe m=134?

Wait, 134 is smaller. Let me check 134⁴ +1.

Compute 134 mod17: 134 /17=7*17=119, so 134-119=15. 15≡-2 mod17.

So 134⁴≡(-2)^4=16≡-1 mod17, which is correct. Now mod289:

Compute 134 mod289 is 134.

Compute 134^2: 134*134=17,956.

Divide 17,956 by289: 289*62=17,918. 17,956-17,918=38. So 134²≡38 mod289.

Then 134^4=(134²)^2=38²=1444. As before, 1444 mod289 is 288. So 134^4 +1=288+1=289≡0 mod289. So yes, 134 is also a solution.

So the minimal positive integer m would be 134? But wait, 134 is bigger than 17, but let's check if there exists a smaller m.

Wait, 134 is the solution, but maybe there's a smaller m than 134. Let me check m=2: 2⁴ +1=17, which is 17, not divisible by 289. So 2 is too small.

Wait, 2 is a solution mod17, but not mod289. So the minimal solution mod289 is 134, which is the minimal positive integer m for p=17.

Wait, but wait, 134 is 134, but wait, 134 is the same as -155 mod289. But maybe the smallest positive solution is 134, but I'm not sure if there's a smaller positive integer m.

Wait, let me think differently. When we lift the solution from mod17 to mod289, the solutions are 2 +17k where k is such that when we plug into Hensel's lemma, we get the lift. But in this case, we found k=153/17=9. So n=2+17*9=155, but that's larger than 134. Alternatively, maybe we can find a smaller k.

Wait, but when I solved for k, I got n=2 +17k where k=153. But wait, 153 is 153 mod289, which is 153. Wait, maybe I should have considered that k could be smaller? Wait, no, because Hensel's lemma gave me a unique lift in this case because the derivative was non-zero mod17.

So the solutions mod289 are 2 +17k where k is such that the correction term gives the zero. So perhaps the minimal positive solution is 134, which is 2 +17*(-9) =2 -153= -151, which mod289 is 138? Wait, no, perhaps I should compute 2 +17k where k= -9, which is 2 -153= -151. mod289, that's 289-151=138. But 138 is less than 134? Wait, 134 is 134, 138 is larger. Wait, maybe I messed up the calculation.

Wait, when I found that n=2 +17k where k=153, that's 2 +17*9=155, as 17*9=153. Alternatively, is there a negative k that gives a smaller positive n? Let's see: 2 +17k ≡0 mod289.

Wait, Hensel's lemma told me that n=2 +17k, where k=153 mod289. But 153 is 153, but 153-289= -136. So 2 +17*(-136)=2 -2312= -2310, which mod289 is equivalent to some positive number. But this seems complicated.

Wait, maybe the minimal positive solution is 134, as that's the smaller of the two solutions 134 and 155. So m=134. But wait, is 134 the minimal possible?

Wait, let me check m=34. 34 is less than 134. Let's compute 34⁴ +1.

But 34 mod17 is 0, so 34⁴ +1 ≡0 +1=1 mod17, which is not 0. So 34 can't be a solution.

What about 15? 15 mod17 is -2. 15⁴ +1≡(-2)^4 +1=16 +1=17≡0 mod17, but mod289?

Compute 15²=225. 225 mod289 is 225.

15⁴=225²=50625. 50625 divided by289: Let's compute 289*175=289*(100+75)=28900 + 21675=50575. 50625-50575=50. So 15⁴≡50 mod289. 50 +1=51≡51 mod289≠0. So 15 isn't a solution mod289.

Similarly, 2: 2⁴ +1=17≡17 mod289≠0.

What about 17? 17⁴ is (17²)²=289²=83521. 83521 +1=83522. Divide by289: 289*289=83521, so 83522=83521 +1=289*289 +1. So 83522 mod289 is 1. So 17⁴ +1≡1 mod289≠0.

What about 19? 19 mod17=2. So 19⁴≡2⁴=16≡-1 mod17, so 19⁴ +1≡0 mod17. Let's compute mod289.

19²=361. 361 mod289=361-289=72.

19⁴=(72)^2=5184. 5184 divided by289: 289*17=4913. 5184-4913=271. So 19⁴≡271 mod289. 271+1=272≡272 mod289≠0.

Hmm. So 19 isn't a solution.

Wait, maybe I need a better approach. Since p=17 is the smallest prime where p² divides n⁴ +1, then m must be 134 or 155. But 134 is smaller, so m=134.

But wait, is 134 the minimal positive integer? Let me try m=118. 118 mod17=118-6*17=118-102=16≡-1 mod17. So 118⁴≡(-1)^4=1 mod17. 1+1=2 mod17≠0. So 118 not a solution.

How about m=113? 113 mod17: 17*6=102, 113-102=11. So 11⁴=14641. 14641 mod17: Let's compute 11 mod17=11. 11²=121≡121-7*17=121-119=2 mod17. 11⁴=(11²)^2=2²=4 mod17. 4+1=5≡5 mod17≠0.

Hmm, so 113 isn't a solution.

Wait, perhaps m=134 is indeed the minimal solution.

But wait, 134 is less than 155, so it's the smaller one. So I think m=134 is the least positive integer such that m⁴ +1 is divisible by17²=289.

Wait, but is 134 the minimal? Let me check m=22. 22 mod17=5. 5⁴=625. 625 mod17: 17*36=612, 625-612=13≡13 mod17. 13+1=14≡14 mod17≠0.

How about m=10? 10 mod17=10. 10²=100≡15, 10⁴=15²=225≡225-12*17=225-204=21 mod17=4. 4+1=5≡5 mod17≠0.

Hmm. It seems like m=134 is indeed the minimal solution.

Wait, but maybe I made a mistake in the Hensel's step. Let me double-check.

We had f(n) =n⁴ +1. At n=2, f(2)=17, which is 17 mod289. We want to find t such that f(2+17t)=0 mod289.

Expanding f(2+17t) ≈ f(2) + f’(2)*(17t) mod289.

f’(2)=4*(2)^3=32.

So f(2+17t) ≈17 +32*(17t) mod289.

Wait, 32*(17t)=544t.

544 mod289: 289*1=289, 544-289=255, which is still bigger than 289? Wait, 289*2=578. 544 is less than 578, so 544 mod289=544-289=255.

So 544t=255t mod289.

So f(2+17t) ≈17 +255t ≡0 mod289.

So 255t ≡-17 mod289.

But 255 mod289 is 255, and -17 is 272.

So 255t ≡272 mod289.

We can write this as 255t ≡272 mod289.

Now, since 255 and 289 may have a GCD. Compute GCD(255,289).

289 = 1*255 + 34

255 =7*34 + 17

34=2*17 +0

So GCD is17.

So, check if 17 divides 272. 272/17=16. Yes, 17*16=272.

Thus, the equation reduces to (255/17)t ≡272/17 mod289/17.

Which is 15t ≡16 mod17.

Because 255/17=15, 272/17=16, and 289/17=17.

So, 15t≡16 mod17.

Find t: 15t ≡16 mod17.

Find inverse of15 mod17. 15≡-2 mod17. So inverse of -2 is -9, because (-2)*(-9)=18≡1 mod17.

So, t≡16*(-9) mod17.

16*(-9)= -144. 144 mod17: 17*8=136, 144-136=8. So -144≡-8≡9 mod17.

So t≡9 mod17.

So t=9 +17s, where s is integer.

Thus, the solution is n=2 +17t=2 +17*(9 +17s)=2 +153 +289s=155 +289s.

Therefore, the minimal positive solution is n=155, but wait, earlier I thought n=134 was a solution. Hmm, seems like a conflict.

Wait, but earlier when I computed n=134, it worked. So is there a mistake here?

Wait, n=134 is 134 mod289. Let me compute t for n=134.

n=2 +17t=134 =>17t=132 =>t=132/17=7.764... which is not an integer. So 134 is not of the form 2 +17t? Wait, that can't be, because 134≡2 mod17, so 134=2 +17k for some k. Let me compute k=(134-2)/17=132/17=7.764… which is 7.764, which is not integer. Wait, that can't be. So 134 is not congruent to 2 mod17? Wait, 134 divided by17 is 7*17=119, 134-119=15. So 134≡15 mod17, not 2 mod17. Oh! So I was mistaken earlier.

Wait, so n=134 is another solution, but it's congruent to 15 mod17, not 2. So perhaps, in addition to the solutions derived from n=2 mod17, there are solutions from n=15 mod17.

Wait, so let me redo Hensel's lemma for n=15 mod17.

So, n=15 mod17. Let me set n=15 +17t, and find t such that n⁴ +1 ≡0 mod289.

Compute f(n)=n⁴ +1.

f(15)=15^4 +1. 15 mod17= -2, so 15^4= (-2)^4=16≡-1 mod17. So 15^4 +1≡0 mod17.

Compute f’(15)=4*(15)^3=4*(3375). Wait, but mod289.

But 15 mod289 is 15, so compute f’(15)=4*(15)^3=4*3375=13,500.

Compute 13,500 mod289.

Compute 289*46=13,294. 13,500-13,294=206. So f’(15)≡206 mod289.

So, f(n)=f(15) + f’(15)*(n-15)≡0 mod289.

We have f(15)=15^4 +1.

15^2=225 mod289=225.

15^4=225²=50,625. 50,625 divided by289: 289*175=50,575. 50,625 -50,575=50. So f(15)=50 +1=51 mod289.

So, f(n) ≈51 +206*(n-15) ≡0 mod289.

Set 206*(n -15) ≡-51 mod289.

-51 mod289 is 238.

So, 206*(n-15) ≡238 mod289.

Compute GCD(206,289). 289=1*206 +83; 206=2*83 +40; 83=2*40 +3; 40=13*3 +1; 3=3*1 +0. So GCD is1.

So inverse of206 mod289 exists. Let me compute it.

Find x such that206x ≡1 mod289.

Using the extended Euclidean algorithm.

289 =1*206 +83

206=2*83 +40

83=2*40 +3

40=13*3 +1

3=3*1 +0

Now backtracking:

1=40 -13*3

But 3=83 -2*40

So, 1=40 -13*(83 -2*40)=27*40 -13*83

But 40=206 -2*83

So, 1=27*(206 -2*83) -13*83=27*206 -54*83 -13*83=27*206 -67*83

But 83=289 -1*206

So, 1=27*206 -67*(289 -1*206)=27*206 -67*289 +67*206= (27+67)*206 -67*289=94*206 -67*289.

Therefore, 94*206 ≡1 mod289. So inverse of206 is94 mod289.

Thus, n-15 ≡238*94 mod289.

Compute 238*94:

First, compute 238 mod289=238.

94 mod289=94.

Compute 238*94:

Well, 200*94=18,800; 38*94=3,572. Total is 18,800 +3,572=22,372.

Compute 22,372 mod289.

Compute how many times 289 fits into22,372.

289*77=289*(70+7)=20,230 +2,023=22,253.

22,372 -22,253=119. So 22,372≡119 mod289.

So, n-15≡119 mod289.

Thus, n=15 +119=134 mod289.

Ah! So n=134 is a solution when starting from n=15 mod17. So 134 is the solution lifting from n=15 mod17.

So the solutions mod289 are n=155 (from n=2 mod17) and n=134 (from n=15 mod17). So the minimal positive solution is134.

So the minimal m is134.

Wait, but earlier when I tried m=134, it worked. So yes, m=134 is the minimal positive integer such that m⁴ +1 is divisible by17²=289.

Therefore, the least prime p is17, and the minimal m is134.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To solve the problem, we need to find the smallest prime \( p \) such that \( p^2 \) divides \( n^4 + 1 \) for some positive integer \( n \). Then, we determine the least positive integer \( m \) such that \( m^4 + 1 \) is divisible by \( p^2 \).

### Step 1: Identifying the Prime \( p \)
Primes \( p \) that divide \( n^4 + 1 \) must satisfy \( p \equiv 1 \pmod{8} \) because \( n^4 \equiv -1 \pmod{p} \) implies the order of \( n \) modulo \( p \) is 8, which divides \( p - 1 \). The smallest such prime is \( p = 17 \).

### Step 2: Finding \( m \) for \( p = 17 \)
We need to find the smallest \( m \) such that \( m^4 + 1 \) is divisible by \( 17^2 = 289 \). 

1. **Modulo 17**: First, find \( n \) such that \( n^4 \equiv -1 \pmod{17} \). Testing small values, \( n = 2 \) works since \( 2^4 = 16 \equiv -1 \pmod{17} \).

2. **Hensel's Lemma**: Lift \( n = 2 \) modulo \( 17 \) to a solution modulo \( 289 \). Set \( n = 2 + 17k \) and solve for \( k \) such that \( (2 + 17k)^4 \equiv -1 \pmod{289} \). After calculations, we find \( k = 153 \), giving \( n = 155 \).

3. **Alternative Solution**: Similarly, starting with \( n = 15 \) modulo \( 17 \) (since \( 15^4 \equiv -1 \pmod{17} \)), we lift to modulo \( 289 \) and find another solution \( n = 134 \).

4. **Minimal Solution**: The smallest positive \( m \) is \( 134 \).

Thus, the least prime \( p \) is \( 17 \), and the minimal \( m \) is \( 134 \).

### Final Answer
The least positive integer \( m \) is \(\boxed{134}\).
