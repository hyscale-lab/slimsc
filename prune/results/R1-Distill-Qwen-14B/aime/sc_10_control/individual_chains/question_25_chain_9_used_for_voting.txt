Okay, so I've got this problem about the residents of Aimeville and the things they own. Let me try to figure this out step by step. 

First, I'll try to list down all the given information so I can see everything clearly. 

We have 900 residents in total. Each resident owns at least one of the four items: a diamond ring, a set of golf clubs, a garden spade, or a bag of candy hearts. Wait, no, actually, wait—the problem says each of the 900 residents owns a bag of candy hearts. So, does that mean every resident has at least the candy hearts? Hmm, that might be important.

Now, the numbers given are:
- 195 own a diamond ring.
- 367 own a set of golf clubs.
- 562 own a garden spade.
- 900 own candy hearts, but since it says "each of the 900 residents owns a bag of candy hearts," that implies that everyone has candy hearts. So, the set for candy hearts is 900.

Then, it says that 437 residents own exactly two of these things, and 234 own exactly three of them. The question is asking for the number of residents who own all four of these things.

Hmm, okay. So, I think this is a problem about sets and their intersections. I remember something about the principle of inclusion-exclusion. Maybe I can use that here.

Let me recall: the inclusion-exclusion principle helps calculate the size of the union of multiple sets by adding the sizes of the individual sets, subtracting the sizes of all possible two-set intersections, adding back the sizes of all possible three-set intersections, and so on.

The formula for four sets is a bit involved, but let me try to write it down. Let’s denote the four sets as follows:
- D: set of residents owning diamond rings.
- G: set of residents owning golf clubs.
- S: set of residents owning garden spades.
- C: set of residents owning candy hearts (which is everyone, so |C|=900).

We’re looking for |D ∩ G ∩ S ∩ C|, the number of residents who own all four.

But wait, since everyone owns C (candy hearts), the intersection of all four is the same as the intersection of D, G, S. So, perhaps it's easier to think in terms of three sets, since C is universal.

But let me proceed step by step.

The total number of residents is 900.

Let me denote:
a = number of residents owning exactly one item.
b = number owning exactly two items (given as 437).
c = number owning exactly three items (given as 234).
d = number owning all four items (this is what we need to find).

So, the total number of residents is a + b + c + d = 900.

But we don't know a yet.

Wait, but inclusion-exclusion might help. Let me try to express it for four sets.

The formula for the union of four sets is:

|D ∪ G ∪ S ∪ C| = |D| + |G| + |S| + |C| - |D∩G| - |D∩S| - |D∩C| - |G∩S| - |G∩C| - |S∩C| + |D∩G∩S| + |D∩G∩C| + |D∩S∩C| + |G∩S∩C| - |D∩G∩S∩C|

But since everyone owns C, the unions and intersections involving C can be simplified. For example, D∩C is just D, because every D resident also has C. Similarly, D∩G∩C is just D∩G, because if someone is in D and G, they must have C as well.

Wait, that might make things easier. Let me think again.

Since C is the set of everyone, any intersection with C is just the other set. So, for example:
- |D ∩ C| = |D| = 195
- Similarly, |G ∩ C| = |G| = 367
- |S ∩ C| = |S| = 562
- And |C| = 900.

So, the inclusion-exclusion formula for |D ∪ G ∪ S ∪ C| becomes:

|D ∪ G ∪ S ∪ C| = |D| + |G| + |S| + |C| - |D∩G| - |D∩S| - |G∩S| - |D∩G∩S| - |D∩G∩S∩C|

Wait, is that right? Because any intersection involving C is just the other sets. So, for example, |D ∩ G ∩ C| = |D ∩ G| because C is universal.

Wait, let me re-examine the inclusion-exclusion formula. Normally, it's:

|A ∪ B ∪ C ∪ D| = |A| + |B| + |C| + |D| - |A∩B| - |A∩C| - |A∩D| - |B∩C| - |B∩D| - |C∩D| + |A∩B∩C| + |A∩B∩D| + |A∩C∩D| + |B∩C∩D| - |A∩B∩C∩D|.

But since C is the universal set, any intersection with C is just the other set. So, for example, |A ∩ C| = |A|, |A ∩ B ∩ C| = |A ∩ B|, |A ∩ B ∩ C ∩ D| = |A ∩ B ∩ D|, because C is included.

Wait, this is getting a bit confusing. Maybe it's better to consider that since C includes everyone, the union of D, G, S, and C is just the union of D, G, S because C covers everything. So, |D ∪ G ∪ S ∪ C| = |D ∪ G ∪ S|, because adding C doesn't change the union.

But wait, no, because D, G, and S are subsets of C. So, their union is still part of C, and since C is the entire population, the union is just C, which is 900. So, |D ∪ G ∪ S ∪ C| = 900.

But wait, that can't be right because D, G, S are subsets of C. So, the union of D, G, S, and C is just C, which is 900. So, |D ∪ G ∪ S ∪ C| = |C| = 900.

So, plugging into the inclusion-exclusion formula:

900 = |D| + |G| + |S| + |C| - |D∩G| - |D∩S| - |G∩S| - |D∩G∩S| - |D∩G∩S∩C|.

Wait, but |C| is 900, and |D|, |G|, |S| are 195, 367, 562 respectively. So, let's plug those in.

900 = 195 + 367 + 562 + 900 - |D∩G| - |D∩S| - |G∩S| - |D∩G∩S| - |D∩G∩S∩C|.

Wait, that seems like a lot. Let me compute the sum: 195 + 367 is 562. 562 +562 is 1124. 1124 +900 is 2024.

So, 900 = 2024 - (|D∩G| + |D∩S| + |G∩S| + |D∩G∩S| + |D∩G∩S∩C|).

Rearranging, |D∩G| + |D∩S| + |G∩S| + |D∩G∩S| + |D∩G∩S∩C| = 2024 - 900 = 1124.

Hmm, okay. Now, I need to relate this to the given information about exactly two and exactly three items.

Let me think about what |D∩G| represents. It's the number of people who own both a diamond ring and a set of golf clubs. But this includes those who might own more than just those two—like those who also own a garden spade or candy hearts.

Wait, but candy hearts are universal, so anyone in D∩G also has candy hearts. So, when considering those who have exactly two items, we have to consider the overlaps that don't include the third item.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to think in terms of the different regions in a Venn diagram. Let's consider all possible overlaps and subtract those who have exactly three or four items.

Wait, the problem states that 437 residents own exactly two of the four things, and 234 own exactly three. Since everyone owns candy hearts, the four things include the candy hearts. So, when they say "exactly two," they mean exactly two of the four, which includes candy hearts.

Wait, but let's break it down. Let me think about how the inclusion-exclusion formula relates to exactly two and exactly three.

In the context of four sets, the number of people owning exactly two items is the sum over all pairs of (|A∩B| - 2|A∩B∩C| + |A∩B∩C∩D|) or something? Wait, maybe that's more complicated.

Alternatively, I remember that for each pair of sets, the intersection's size includes those who have exactly those two, those who have those two plus the third, and those who have all four.

So, for example, |D∩G| includes:
- The number of people who have exactly D and G (and nothing else except C, which is universal).
- Plus those who have D, G, and S (and C).
- Plus those who have D, G, S, and C (all four).

Similarly for the other pairwise intersections.

So, in terms of the counts:
For each pair, |A∩B| = a_AB + a_AB_C + a_AB_C_D,

where a_AB is the number with exactly A and B,
a_AB_C is the number with exactly A, B, and C,
and a_AB_C_D is the number with all four.

Wait, but since C is universal, a_AB_C is actually the number of people with exactly A and B, because C is already included in everyone. Hmm, maybe I'm complicating this.

Alternatively, perhaps we can express the pairwise intersections in terms of exactly two, exactly three, and exactly four.

Let me denote:
- Let x be the number of people who own exactly two items (given as 437).
- Let y be the number who own exactly three (given as 234).
- Let z be the number who own all four (what we need to find).

So, the total number of residents is:

a (exactly one) + x (exactly two) + y (exactly three) + z (exactly four) = 900.

But we don't know a yet.

Wait, but each of the individual sets like |D| includes people who have D and nothing else, D plus one other, D plus two others, etc. So, |D| = (number with exactly D) + (number with exactly D and one other) + (number with exactly D and two others) + (number with all four).

But perhaps that's getting too detailed. Maybe a better approach is to consider the sum of all pairwise intersections, etc.

Wait, another approach: the sum of the sizes of all individual sets equals the number of items owned by all residents. Let me think.

Each resident owns some number of items. The sum over all residents of the number of items they own is equal to the sum of the sizes of all four sets.

So, sum of |D| + |G| + |S| + |C| = sum over all residents of the number of items they own.

But since |C|=900, and everyone owns C, the sum of the sizes is 195 + 367 + 562 + 900 = 195+367=562; 562+562=1124; 1124+900=2024.

So, the total number of items owned by all residents is 2024.

Now, the total number of items can also be calculated by considering each resident and how many items they own. Since each resident can own 1, 2, 3, or 4 items.

Let me denote:
- a: number of residents owning exactly 1 item.
- x: exactly 2 items (437).
- y: exactly 3 items (234).
- z: exactly 4 items (the one we need to find).

So, the total number of residents is a + x + y + z = 900.

The total number of items owned is then:

a*(1) + x*(2) + y*(3) + z*(4) = 1*a + 2*x + 3*y +4*z.

But we know from earlier that this equals 2024.

So, a + 2x + 3y + 4z = 2024.

We have two equations:

1) a + x + y + z = 900
2) a + 2x + 3y +4z =2024

We can subtract equation 1 from equation 2 to eliminate a:

(a + 2x +3y +4z) - (a +x + y + z) )= 2024 -900
Which gives:
x + 2y +3z = 1124.

We know x is 437 and y is 234, so plug those in:

437 + 2*234 +3z = 1124.

Calculating:

2*234 = 468. So:

437 +468 = 905.

So, 905 +3z =1124.

Subtract 905:

3z = 1124 -905 = 219.

So, z =219 /3 = 73.

So, the number of residents who own all four items is 73.

Wait, let me check that again.

Wait, 437 + 2*234 = 437 + 468 = 905.

1124 - 905 = 219.

219 divided by 3 is 73.

Yep, that seems correct.

So, the answer should be 73.

To solve the problem, we use the principle of inclusion-exclusion and the given data about the residents of Aimeville.

We denote:
- \( |D| = 195 \) (diamond rings),
- \( |G| = 367 \) (golf clubs),
- \( |S| = 562 \) (garden spades),
- \( |C| = 900 \) (candy hearts, universal set),
- \( x = 437 \) (exactly two items),
- \( y = 234 \) (exactly three items),
- \( z \) (exactly four items, to find).

The total number of residents is:
\[
a + x + y + z = 900
\]
where \( a \) is the number of residents owning exactly one item.

The total number of items owned by all residents is:
\[
|D| + |G| + |S| + |C| = 195 + 367 + 562 + 900 = 2024
\]
This can also be expressed as:
\[
a \cdot 1 + x \cdot 2 + y \cdot 3 + z \cdot 4 = 2024
\]

Subtracting the first equation from the second:
\[
(a + 2x + 3y + 4z) - (a + x + y + z) = 2024 - 900
\]
\[
x + 2y + 3z = 1124
\]

Substituting \( x = 437 \) and \( y = 234 \):
\[
437 + 2(234) + 3z = 1124
\]
\[
437 + 468 + 3z = 1124
\]
\[
905 + 3z = 1124
\]
\[
3z = 219
\]
\[
z = 73
\]

Thus, the number of residents who own all four items is \(\boxed{73}\).
