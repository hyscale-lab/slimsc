Okay, so I have this problem about rectangular boxes with a given surface area and volume, and I need to find the radius of the smallest sphere that can contain any of these boxes. Then, express r squared as a fraction p/q, where p and q are coprime, and find p+q.

Alright, let's break down the problem.

First, the boxes are rectangular, so their dimensions are length, width, and height, which I'll denote as x, y, z. 

Given:
- Surface area = 54
- Volume = 23

I remember that for a rectangular box, the surface area S is 2(xy + yz + zx), and the volume V is xyz. So:

2(xy + yz + zx) = 54 ⇒ xy + yz + zx = 27.

And xyz = 23.

I need to find the smallest sphere that can contain the box, so the sphere's diameter must be equal to the space diagonal of the box. The space diagonal d of a rectangular box is sqrt(x² + y² + z²). Therefore, the radius r is half of that: r = d/2 ⇒ r² = (x² + y² + z²)/4.

So, my goal is to find the minimal value of sqrt(x² + y² + z²)/2, which translates to minimizing x² + y² + z², given the constraints on surface area and volume.

So I need to minimize x² + y² + z², given that xy + yz + zx = 27 and xyz = 23.

Hmm, this seems like an optimization problem with constraints. Maybe I can use Lagrange multipliers or some inequality to find the minimum.

Let me think about symmetric conditions. If I assume x = y = z, that might not satisfy the volume condition because if x = y = z, then the volume would be x³, and surface area would be 6x². Let me check:

If x = y = z, then:

6x² = 54 ⇒ x² = 9 ⇒ x = 3. Then volume would be 27, but our volume is 23. So the box can't be a cube. So the minimal sphere might not correspond to a cube, but perhaps to a more elongated box.

Alternatively, maybe the minimal diagonal occurs when two variables are equal, and the third is different. Let's assume x = y, so it's a square prism instead of a cube.

Let me try setting x = y. Then, our variables are x, x, z.

So, surface area:

2(x^2 + xz + xz) = 2x² + 4xz = 54 ⇒ x² + 2xz = 27.

Volume:

x * x * z = x² z = 23 ⇒ x² z = 23.

So from the volume, z = 23 / x².

Substitute into the surface area equation:

x² + 2x*(23 / x²) = 27 ⇒ x² + (46 / x) = 27.

Multiply through by x to eliminate the denominator:

x³ + 46 = 27x ⇒ x³ - 27x + 46 = 0.

Hmm, I need to solve this cubic equation: x³ -27x +46 = 0.

Let me try rational roots. The possible rational roots are factors of 46 over factors of 1, so ±1, ±2, ±23, ±46.

Testing x=1: 1 -27 +46 = 20 ≠0

x=2: 8 -54 +46 = 0 ⇒ 0! So x=2 is a root.

So, I can factor this as (x - 2)(x² + 2x -23) = 0.

Setting x² + 2x -23 =0 gives x = [-2 ± sqrt(4 +92)]/2 = (-2 ± sqrt(96))/2 = (-2 ± 4*sqrt(6))/2 = -1 ± 2sqrt(6). Since x>0, x= -1 + 2sqrt(6). Let me compute that: sqrt(6)≈2.449, so 2sqrt(6)≈4.898, so x≈3.898.

So we have two possible x values when x=y: x=2 and x≈3.898.

But does x=2 make sense? Let me check.

If x=2, then z=23/(2²)=23/4=5.75.

So, dimensions x=2, y=2, z=5.75.

Surface area: 2(4 + 2*5.75 + 2*5.75) = 2(4 + 11.5 + 11.5) = 2(27) =54. That's correct.

Volume: 2*2*5.75=23. Correct.

So x=2 is a valid solution.

Similarly, the other root x≈3.898 would give z=23/(x²). Let me compute x²: (approx 3.898)^2 ≈15.196. So z≈23/15.196≈1.514.

So dimensions x≈3.898, y≈3.898, z≈1.514.

Surface area: 2(x² + y z + y z) ≈ 2(15.196 + 3.898*1.514 * 2) ≈ 2(15.196 + 3.898*3.028) ≈ 2(15.196 + 11.809) ≈ 2(27) ≈54. Correct.

Volume: 3.898^2 *1.514 ≈15.196 *1.514≈23. Correct.

So both solutions are valid, but for the minimal sphere, I think the diagonal might be smaller for the x=2 case.

Wait, let's compute x² + y² + z² for both cases.

Case 1: x=2, y=2, z=5.75.

x² + y² + z² = 4 +4 + (5.75)^2 = 8 +33.0625=41.0625.

So r²=41.0625/4=10.265625.

Case 2: x≈3.898, y≈3.898, z≈1.514.

x² + y² + z² ≈2*(3.898)^2 + (1.514)^2 ≈2*15.196 + 2.292≈30.392 +2.292≈32.684.

So r²≈32.684/4≈8.171.

Wait, but 8.171 is smaller than 10.265, so the sphere radius squared is smaller in this second case.

But wait, that can't be right, because when I set x=y, perhaps that's not the case where the sphere is smallest. Maybe the minimal occurs when all variables are different. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that maybe the minimal sphere occurs when the box is a cube, but we saw that a cube gives a volume of 27, which is higher than 23, so it's not possible. So, it's a more stretched box.

Alternatively, maybe the minimal sphere corresponds to the box where the space diagonal is minimized, given the constraints.

Alternatively, perhaps using the method of Lagrange multipliers.

Let me denote f(x,y,z) = x² + y² + z².

Subject to constraints:

g(x,y,z) = xy + yz + zx =27,

h(x,y,z) = xyz=23.

So, using Lagrange multipliers, I can set up the following system:

∇f = λ∇g + μ∇h.

Which gives:

2x = λ(y + z) + μ(yz),

2y = λ(x + z) + μ(xz),

2z = λ(x + y) + μ(xy).

Hmm, that gives three equations.

Also, we have the constraints:

xy + yz + zx =27,

xyz=23.

So, altogether, five equations with five variables: x,y,z,λ,μ.

This might get complicated, but perhaps we can find symmetry or ratios.

Let me assume that two variables are equal, but not necessarily all three. So, perhaps x = y.

Wait, I already tried that, and found x=2 and x≈3.898. Could it be that in the minimal case, x = y?

Wait, in the case where x = y, we found a smaller sphere when using x≈3.898, but perhaps that's not the minimal.

Wait, actually, when you have a box, the space diagonal is minimized when the box is as "cube-like" as possible, given constraints.

But in our case, the volume is fixed at 23, which is less than the cube volume of 27 when surface area is the same.

So perhaps the minimal occurs when the box is as close to a cube as possible, but given that the volume is lower, it might be more elongated in one direction.

Alternatively, perhaps the minimal occurs when two variables are equal, so I can proceed with the case x=y.

Wait, in the case where x=y, we have two solutions. One with x=2, z=5.75, which gives a larger diagonal, and another with x≈3.898, z≈1.514, which gives a smaller diagonal.

So, perhaps the minimal occurs when x=y, so the minimal r² is approximately 8.171.

But let me compute it exactly.

Given that we had x³ -27x +46=0, and x=2 is a root, we factored it as (x-2)(x² +2x -23)=0.

So the other roots are x = [-2 ± sqrt(4 +92)]/2 = (-2 ± sqrt(96))/2 = (-2 ± 4*sqrt(6))/2 = -1 ± 2sqrt(6).

Since x must be positive, x= -1 + 2sqrt(6). Let's compute that.

sqrt(6) is approximately 2.449, so 2sqrt(6)≈4.898. Then, -1 + 4.898≈3.898. So x= -1 + 2sqrt(6).

So, x=2sqrt(6) -1.

So, exact value of x is 2sqrt(6) -1.

Then, z=23/x².

So, let's compute x²:

x=2sqrt(6)-1,

x² = (2sqrt(6) -1)^2 = (2sqrt(6))^2 - 2*(2sqrt(6))*(1) +1^2 = 24 -4sqrt(6) +1=25 -4sqrt(6).

Then, z=23/(25 -4sqrt(6)).

To rationalize the denominator:

Multiply numerator and denominator by (25 +4sqrt(6)):

z=23*(25 +4sqrt(6))/[(25)^2 - (4sqrt(6))^2] =23*(25 +4sqrt(6))/(625 - 16*6)=23*(25 +4sqrt(6))/(625-96)=23*(25 +4sqrt(6))/529.

Simplify 23/529=1/23.

So z= (25 +4sqrt(6))/23.

So z=(25 +4sqrt(6))/23.

Now, the dimensions are x=2sqrt(6)-1, y=2sqrt(6)-1, z=(25 +4sqrt(6))/23.

We need to compute x² + y² + z².

Since x=y, this is 2x² + z².

We already have x²=25 -4sqrt(6).

So, 2x²=2*(25 -4sqrt(6))=50 -8sqrt(6).

z²= [ (25 +4sqrt(6))/23 ]^2.

Compute numerator: (25)^2 + 2*25*4sqrt(6) + (4sqrt(6))^2 =625 + 200sqrt(6) + 16*6=625 +200sqrt(6)+96=721 +200sqrt(6).

So z²= (721 +200sqrt(6))/(23^2)= (721 +200sqrt(6))/529.

Thus, x² + y² + z²= 50 -8sqrt(6) + (721 +200sqrt(6))/529.

Let me write all terms over 529:

50 = (50*529)/529=26450/529,

-8sqrt(6)= (-8sqrt(6)*529)/529= (-4232sqrt(6))/529,

(721 +200sqrt(6))/529 remains as is.

So adding them together:

(26450 -4232sqrt(6) +721 +200sqrt(6))/529.

Combine like terms:

26450 +721 =27171,

-4232sqrt(6) +200sqrt(6)= (-4232 +200)sqrt(6)= (-4032)sqrt(6).

So x² + y² + z²= (27171 -4032sqrt(6))/529.

Now, r² = (x² + y² + z²)/4 = (27171 -4032sqrt(6))/(4*529).

Compute denominator: 4*529=2116.

So r²= (27171 -4032sqrt(6))/2116.

Hmm, that's a fraction. Let me see if I can simplify this.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me double-check.

Wait, when I was computing x² + y² + z², that's:

2x² + z² = 2*(25 -4sqrt(6)) + (721 +200sqrt(6))/529.

Which is 50 -8sqrt(6) + (721 +200sqrt(6))/529.

To combine these, we can write 50 as 50*529/529=26450/529.

-8sqrt(6) as (-8sqrt(6)*529)/529= (-4232sqrt(6))/529.

So adding all together:

(26450 -4232sqrt(6) +721 +200sqrt(6))/529.

Yes, that's correct.

26450 +721 =27171,

-4232sqrt(6) +200sqrt(6)= (-4032sqrt(6)).

So numerator is 27171 -4032sqrt(6).

Denominator is 529.

Then, r²= (27171 -4032sqrt(6))/2116.

Wait, 2116 is 4*529, correct.

But let me check if 27171 and 2116 have a common factor.

27171 ÷ 2116: 2116*12=25392, 27171-25392=1779.

2116 and 1779: 1779 ÷ 2116, no. Let me check gcd(27171,2116).

2116=4*529=4*23².

27171: let's see if 23 divides it.

23*1181=27163, which is 27171-27163=8, so 23*1181 +8=27171. So 23 doesn't divide 27171.

Similarly, 2116 is divisible by 4 and 23².

So the fraction (27171 -4032sqrt(6))/2116 is already in simplest terms because numerator is 27171 -4032sqrt(6), and denominator 2116=4*529.

Wait, but sqrt(6) is irrational, so we can't combine terms. Thus, the expression is as simplified as it can be.

But wait, the problem states that r² can be written as p/q where p and q are coprime positive integers. But in my expression, it's (27171 -4032sqrt(6))/2116, which includes a radical. That can't be expressed as a fraction of integers. So perhaps my approach is wrong.

Hmm, maybe assuming x=y is not the way to go, or perhaps the minimal occurs when x, y, z are all distinct.

Wait, another approach: perhaps using the inequality between the space diagonal and the surface area and volume.

I remember that for a rectangular box, the space diagonal squared is x² + y² + z², which I need to minimize.

We have two constraints: xy + yz + zx=27 and xyz=23.

I wonder if there's a way to express x² + y² + z² in terms of these.

We know that (x + y + z)^2 = x² + y² + z² + 2(xy + yz + zx).

So, x² + y² + z² = (x + y + z)^2 - 2*27 = (x + y + z)^2 -54.

So, to minimize x² + y² + z², we need to minimize (x + y + z)^2.

Thus, minimizing (x + y + z).

Hmm, maybe I can use AM >= GM or other inequalities.

But since we have fixed surface area and volume, perhaps we can find the minimal value of x + y + z.

Wait, but how?

Alternatively, maybe use the method of Lagrange multipliers without assuming x=y.

Let me try that.

We have function to minimize: f(x,y,z)=x² + y² + z².

Constraints:

g(x,y,z)=xy + yz + zx=27,

h(x,y,z)=xyz=23.

Using Lagrange multipliers, set up:

∇f = λ∇g + μ∇h.

Which gives:

2x = λ(y + z) + μ(yz),

2y = λ(x + z) + μ(xz),

2z = λ(x + y) + μ(xy).

So, three equations.

We also have the two constraints: xy + yz + zx=27 and xyz=23.

So, five equations with five variables x,y,z,λ,μ.

This is a system of nonlinear equations. Hmm, looks complicated, but perhaps we can find ratios.

Let me subtract the first equation from the second:

2y - 2x = λ(x + z - y - z) + μ(yz - xz)

Simplify:

2(y - x) = λ(x - y) + μ z(y - x).

Factor out (y - x):

2(y - x) = (λ(x - y) + μ z(y - x)) = ( -λ(y -x) + μ z (y -x)) = (y -x)(-λ + μ z).

So, if y ≠ x, we can divide both sides by (y -x):

2 = -λ + μ z.

Similarly, subtract the first equation from the third:

2z -2x = λ(x + y - y - z) + μ(zx - yz).

Simplify:

2(z - x) = λ(x - z) + μ z(x - y).

Factor:

2(z -x) = λ(x - z) + μ z(x - y).

Let me write it as:

2(z -x) = -λ(z -x) + μ z(x - y).

If z ≠x, we can divide both sides by (z -x):

2 = -λ + μ z ( (x - y)/(z -x) )

Hmm, this is getting complicated. Maybe another approach.

Alternatively, let's consider that the ratios of the partial derivatives should be equal.

From the three Lagrange multiplier equations:

2x / (y + z + (μ yz)/2 ) = 2y / (x + z + (μ xz)/2 ) = 2z / (x + y + (μ xy)/2 )

Wait, perhaps not helpful.

Alternatively, let me consider the ratios of the equations.

From first and second equation:

2x / (y + z) = [λ + μ(yz)/2 ]

Similarly, 2y / (x + z) = [λ + μ(xz)/2 ]

Set them equal:

2x/(y+z) = 2y/(x+z)

Cross multiply:

2x(x + z) = 2y(y + z)

Simplify:

x² + xz = y² + yz

Rearranged:

x² - y² + xz - yz =0 ⇒ (x - y)(x + y) + z(x - y)=0 ⇒ (x - y)(x + y + z)=0.

So either x=y, or x + y + z=0.

But x, y, z are positive, so x + y + z ≠0. Hence, x=y.

Similarly, subtracting other pairs will give y=z or x=z.

So, from this, we can conclude that either x=y=z, which is the cube case, but as we saw earlier, that's not possible because volume would be 27, which is higher than 23.

Alternatively, if x=y, but z different.

Which is the case we considered earlier.

So, this suggests that the minimal occurs when two variables are equal, and the third is different.

Hence, I can go back to the case where x=y, which we already explored.

Thus, the minimal r² is (27171 -4032sqrt(6))/2116.

Wait, but the problem says r² can be written as p/q where p and q are coprime positive integers. But my expression has a sqrt(6), which is irrational. So, perhaps I made a mistake in my approach.

Wait, perhaps I should not assume x=y, but rather, that the minimal occurs when variables are not equal.

Wait, but according to the Lagrange multipliers, we get that x=y, but perhaps there's another condition when variables are not equal.

Alternatively, perhaps the minimal occurs when z is the geometric mean of x and y, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps I can express x, y, z in terms of variables a, b, c such that x= a + b, y= a + c, z= b + c, but that might complicate.

Wait, another approach: Let me denote S= x + y + z, P=xyz=23, and Q=xy + yz + zx=27.

We also have that x² + y² + z² = S² - 2Q = S² -54.

So, to minimize x² + y² + z², we need to minimize S².

So, our goal is to find the minimal possible S given that P=23 and Q=27.

Hmm, perhaps we can use the inequality that relates S, Q, and P.

I know that for positive real numbers, (x + y + z)^3 >= 27xyz, but that's AM >= GM.

But in this case, (S)^3 >= 27P=27*23=621.

So, S^3 >=621 ⇒ S>= cube root(621).

Compute cube root of 621: 8^3=512, 9^3=729. So cube root(621)≈8.53.

But this is just a lower bound, not necessarily achievable.

But in our case, when x=y, we found S≈2*3.898 +1.514≈7.796 +1.514≈9.31. Which is higher than 8.53.

So maybe the minimal S occurs when x, y, z are not equal, but more balanced.

Alternatively, maybe I can use the inequality that relates S, Q, and P.

Another approach: Let me consider the cubic equation whose roots are x, y, z.

Let the cubic equation be t^3 - At^2 + Bt - C=0, where A=x+y+z, B=xy+yz+zx=27, C=xyz=23.

So, t^3 - A t^2 +27 t -23=0.

We can analyze this cubic equation to find the roots.

But this might not directly help in finding A.

Alternatively, perhaps using the method of symmetric polynomials.

Alternatively, perhaps use the inequality that for any real numbers,

(x + y + z)^2 >= 3(xy + yz + zx).

Which would give S² >= 81 ⇒ S >=9.

Wait, (x + y + z)^2 >= 3(xy + yz +zx)=81 ⇒ x + y + z >=9.

So, S>=9.

In our earlier case where x=y≈3.898 and z≈1.514, S≈3.898 +3.898 +1.514≈9.31, which is above 9.

So, the minimal S is 9, but can it be achieved?

If S=9, then x + y + z=9, and xy + yz +zx=27.

But if x + y + z=9, and xy + yz +zx=27, then from the identity:

(x + y + z)^2 = x² + y² + z² + 2(xy + yz +zx).

So, 81= x² + y² + z² +54 ⇒ x² + y² + z²=27.

But wait, the volume is xyz=23.

So, for x + y + z=9, xy + yz +zx=27, and xyz=23.

Is this possible? Let's check if such real positive numbers exist.

Alternatively, let me see if the cubic equation t^3 -9t^2 +27t -23=0 has three positive real roots.

Compute its discriminant.

The discriminant D of a cubic equation t^3 + a t^2 +b t +c=0 is D=18abc -4a^3c +a^2b^2 -4b^3 -27c^2.

Wait, more accurately, for equation t^3 + pt^2 + qt + r=0,

D=18pqr -4p^3 r +p^2 q^2 -4q^3 -27r^2.

In our case, equation is t^3 -9t^2 +27t -23=0, so p=-9, q=27, r=-23.

Compute D:

18*(-9)*27*(-23) -4*(-9)^3*(-23) + (-9)^2*(27)^2 -4*(27)^3 -27*(-23)^2.

Let me compute each term step by step.

First term: 18*(-9)*27*(-23).

Compute 18*9=162, 162*27=4374, 4374*23=99, 4374*20=87,480; 4374*3=13,122; total 87,480 +13,122=100,602. So first term is 100,602.

Second term: -4*(-9)^3*(-23).

(-9)^3= -729. So, -4*(-729)*(-23)= -4*(729*23)= -4*(16,767)= -67,068.

Third term: (-9)^2*(27)^2=81*729=59,049.

Fourth term: -4*(27)^3= -4*19,683= -78,732.

Fifth term: -27*(-23)^2= -27*529= -14,283.

So, summing all terms:

100,602 -67,068 +59,049 -78,732 -14,283.

Compute step by step:

100,602 -67,068=33,534.

33,534 +59,049=92,583.

92,583 -78,732=13,851.

13,851 -14,283= -432.

So discriminant D= -432.

Since D<0, the cubic has one real root and two complex conjugate roots.

Thus, the equation t^3 -9t^2 +27t -23=0 has one real root and two complex roots.

But we need all roots positive real, so S=9 is not achievable because it would require all roots real, but the discriminant is negative.

Thus, S must be greater than 9.

So, minimal S is greater than 9.

Wait, so the minimal S is higher than 9, so the minimal x^2 + y^2 + z^2 is greater than 27.

But in our earlier case, x=y≈3.898, z≈1.514, x^2 + y^2 + z^2≈32.684.

But according to the Lagrange multiplier, the minimal occurs when x=y, so is that the minimal?

But according to the cubic equation, when x=y, it's a valid case, but perhaps the minimal is indeed when x=y.

Wait, but maybe the minimal occurs when two variables are equal, but not all three, which is what we have.

So, perhaps the minimal r² is (27171 -4032sqrt(6))/2116.

But the problem states that r² can be written as p/q, implying a rational number. But my calculation gives an expression with sqrt(6).

Hmm, maybe I made a mistake earlier.

Wait, perhaps I should not assume x=y, but instead use a different substitution.

Alternatively, perhaps I can express the problem in terms of u = x + y + z, v = xy + yz + zx=27, w=xyz=23.

We know that x² + y² + z²= u² - 2v= u² -54.

We need to minimize u² -54, which is equivalent to minimizing u.

So, minimal u.

But to find the minimal u, perhaps I can use the inequality that for positive reals,

u^3 >= 27w,

which is u^3 >=27*23=621 ⇒ u >= cube_root(621)≈8.53.

But earlier, we saw that u must be at least 9. So, which one is it?

Wait, perhaps I can use the inequality that relates u, v, w.

From the theory of symmetric means, we have u >= 3*(w)^{1/3}.

But in our case, u >= 3*(23)^{1/3}≈3*2.843≈8.529, which is about 8.53.

But from the other inequality, (x + y + z)^2 >=3(xy + yz +zx)=81 ⇒ u >=9.

So, the tighter lower bound is u >=9.

So, we know that u must be at least 9, but in reality, the minimal u is higher than 9 because when u=9, the cubic equation has only one real root, so it's not achievable.

So, the minimal u is somewhere above 9.

But how to find it?

Alternatively, perhaps minimal occurs when two variables are equal, which gives us u=2x + z, and we can express in terms of x.

Wait, earlier when we set x=y, and solved for x, we found two solutions, x=2 and x=2sqrt(6)-1≈3.898.

Wait, for x=2, u=2+2+5.75=9.75.

For x=2sqrt(6)-1≈3.898, u≈2*3.898 +1.514≈7.796 +1.514≈9.31.

Which is less than 9.75, so perhaps the minimal u is around 9.31.

But is that the minimal possible u?

Wait, perhaps not, because when variables are unequal, u can be even smaller.

Wait, but according to the Lagrange multipliers, the minimal occurs when two variables are equal, so perhaps that's the minimal.

Alternatively, perhaps when one variable is as small as possible, making the other two as large as possible, but that would probably increase u.

Wait, perhaps it's better to accept that the minimal occurs when two variables are equal, so the minimal u is when x=y, and that gives us the minimal x^2 + y^2 + z^2.

Thus, going back to the earlier calculation, the minimal x² + y² + z² is (27171 -4032sqrt(6))/529, and then r²=(27171 -4032sqrt(6))/(4*529)= (27171 -4032sqrt(6))/2116.

But this can't be expressed as a rational number, so perhaps I made a mistake in the approach.

Wait, perhaps I should have used different variables or a different substitution.

Alternatively, perhaps I can let a = x, b=y, c=z, and try to find the minimal value of a² + b² +c² given that ab + bc +ac=27 and abc=23.

Wait, perhaps I can use the method of substitution.

Let me set variables in terms of a single variable.

Let me set a = b, as before.

So, a^2 + 2ac=27 and a^2 c=23.

From a^2 c=23, c=23/(a^2).

Substitute into a^2 + 2a*(23/(a^2))=27,

Which is a^2 +46/a=27.

Multiply both sides by a: a^3 +46=27a ⇒ a^3 -27a +46=0.

We solved this earlier, and found a=2 and a= -1 +2sqrt(6).

So, for a=2, c=23/(4)=5.75.

So, dimensions (2,2,5.75), sum of squares=4+4+33.0625=41.0625.

r²=41.0625/4=10.265625=41.0625/4= (657/16). Wait, 41.0625 is 41 +1/16=657/16. So, 657/16 divided by 4 is 657/(16*4)=657/64.

Wait, 657 divided by 64 is 10.265625. So, r²=657/64.

Wait, but earlier when I computed for a=2sqrt(6)-1≈3.898, I got x² + y² + z²≈32.684, which is less than 41.0625.

But that led to an expression with sqrt(6), which can't be expressed as p/q.

But if I take the other solution, a= -1 +2sqrt(6), which is approximately 3.898, then let's compute x² + y² + z² exactly.

As we did earlier, x=2sqrt(6)-1, y=2sqrt(6)-1, z=(25 +4sqrt(6))/23.

So, x² + y² + z²=2*(25 -4sqrt(6)) + (25 +4sqrt(6))²/(23²).

Wait, compute (25 +4sqrt(6))²=625 + 200sqrt(6) + 16*6=625 +200sqrt(6) +96=721 +200sqrt(6).

So, z²=(721 +200sqrt(6))/529.

So, x² + y² + z²= 2*(25 -4sqrt(6)) + (721 +200sqrt(6))/529.

Compute 2*(25 -4sqrt(6))=50 -8sqrt(6).

So, total is 50 -8sqrt(6) + (721 +200sqrt(6))/529.

To combine, write 50 as 50*529/529=26450/529.

-8sqrt(6)= (-8sqrt(6)*529)/529= -4232sqrt(6)/529.

So total is (26450 -4232sqrt(6) +721 +200sqrt(6))/529.

Combine terms:

26450 +721=27171,

-4232sqrt(6)+200sqrt(6)= (-4032sqrt(6)).

So, x² + y² + z²= (27171 -4032sqrt(6))/529.

Thus, r²= (27171 -4032sqrt(6))/(4*529)= (27171 -4032sqrt(6))/2116.

Hmm, but this is irrational, which contradicts the problem statement that r² is a rational number p/q.

Therefore, my assumption that x=y must be incorrect, or perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, perhaps the minimal occurs when all three variables are equal, but that's impossible because the volume would be 27, not 23.

Alternatively, perhaps the minimal occurs when one variable is as small as possible, but that's not necessarily the case.

Wait, perhaps I can consider that when the sphere is minimal, the box is inscribed such that all its vertices touch the sphere. But that requires the space diagonal to be equal to 2r.

Wait, but regardless, the space diagonal is the same as the diameter of the sphere.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the sphere must contain all points of the box, so the sphere's diameter is the space diagonal.

Thus, regardless of the box's dimensions, the minimal sphere is determined by the space diagonal.

Wait, so perhaps the minimal r is the minimal possible space diagonal divided by 2.

But how do I find the minimal space diagonal given the surface area and volume.

Wait, perhaps using the method of Lagrange multipliers without assuming x=y.

Let me try that again.

We have to minimize f(x,y,z)=x² + y² + z²,

subject to g(x,y,z)=xy + yz + zx=27,

and h(x,y,z)=xyz=23.

Using Lagrange multipliers, we have:

2x = λ(y + z) + μ(yz),

2y = λ(x + z) + μ(xz),

2z = λ(x + y) + μ(xy).

Let me write these as:

2x = λ(y + z) + μ yz,

2y = λ(x + z) + μ xz,

2z = λ(x + y) + μ xy.

Let me subtract the first equation from the second:

2y - 2x = λ(x + z - y - z) + μ(xz - yz).

Simplify:

2(y - x)=λ(x - y) + μ z(x - y).

Factor (y -x):

2(y -x)= (λ(x - y) + μ z(x - y))= (x - y)(-λ + μ z).

So, if y≠x, divide both sides by (y -x):

2= -λ + μ z.

Similarly, subtract first equation from third:

2z -2x = λ(x + y - y - z) + μ(zx - yz).

Simplify:

2(z -x)=λ(x - z) + μ z(x - y).

Factor:

2(z -x)=λ(x - z) + μ z(x - y).

If z≠x, divide both sides by (z -x):

2= -λ + μ z ( (x - y)/(z -x) ).

Hmm, this is getting complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps express λ and μ in terms of variables.

From the first equation:

2x = λ(y + z) + μ yz ⇒ λ= [2x - μ yz]/(y + z).

Similarly, from the second equation:

2y=λ(x + z) + μ xz ⇒ λ= [2y - μ xz]/(x + z).

Set them equal:

[2x - μ yz]/(y + z) = [2y - μ xz]/(x + z).

Cross multiplying:

(2x - μ yz)(x + z) = (2y - μ xz)(y + z).

Expand both sides:

2x(x + z) - μ yz(x + z) = 2y(y + z) - μ xz(y + z).

Simplify:

2x² + 2xz - μ yz x - μ yz z = 2y² + 2yz - μ xz y - μ xz z.

Bring all terms to left side:

2x² + 2xz - μ yz x - μ yz z -2y² -2yz + μ xz y + μ xz z=0.

Simplify term by term:

2x² - 2y²,

2xz - 2yz,

- μ yz x + μ xz y=0,

- μ yz z + μ xz z= μ z^2(x - y).

So, overall:

2(x² - y²) + 2z(x - y) + μ z²(x - y)=0.

Factor (x - y):

[2(x + y) + 2z + μ z²] (x - y)=0.

So, either x=y, or 2(x + y) + 2z + μ z²=0.

But since x, y, z are positive, 2(x + y) + 2z + μ z²=0 is impossible because all terms are positive except possibly μ, but μ would have to be negative to make this zero, but I'm not sure.

Thus, the only possibility is x=y.

Similarly, by symmetry, if we subtract other pairs, we get y=z or x=z.

Thus, the minimal occurs when two variables are equal, which is what I initially assumed.

Therefore, the minimal occurs when x=y, leading to the solution we found earlier, even though it results in an irrational r².

But the problem states that r² can be written as p/q, which is a rational number.

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation earlier.

Wait, let me recompute the expression for x² + y² + z² when x=y=2sqrt(6)-1 and z=(25 +4sqrt(6))/23.

Compute x²:

x=2sqrt(6)-1,

x²= (2sqrt(6))² - 2*2sqrt(6)*1 +1²=24 -4sqrt(6) +1=25 -4sqrt(6).

So, 2x²=50 -8sqrt(6).

z=(25 +4sqrt(6))/23,

z²= (25 +4sqrt(6))² /23²= (625 + 200sqrt(6) + 96)/529=(721 +200sqrt(6))/529.

So, x² + y² + z²=2x² + z²=50 -8sqrt(6) + (721 +200sqrt(6))/529.

Convert to a common denominator:

50=50*529/529=26450/529,

-8sqrt(6)= -8sqrt(6)*529/529= -4232sqrt(6)/529,

So, x² + y² + z²= (26450 -4232sqrt(6) +721 +200sqrt(6))/529.

Simplify numerator:

26450 +721=27171,

-4232sqrt(6) +200sqrt(6)=(-4032sqrt(6)).

So, x² + y² + z²=(27171 -4032sqrt(6))/529.

Then, r²=(27171 -4032sqrt(6))/(4*529)= same as (27171 -4032sqrt(6))/2116.

Wait, but this is an irrational number, but the problem says it's a rational number p/q.

Thus, perhaps I made a wrong assumption somewhere.

Alternatively, perhaps the minimal occurs when all three variables are different.

Wait, perhaps using the method of Lagrange multipliers, but without assuming x=y, leads to a solution where x, y, z are all different, and the resulting r² is rational.

But this would require solving the system of equations, which is complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps there's a different approach.

Wait, perhaps using the inequality that relates the space diagonal to surface area and volume.

I recall that for a rectangular box, the space diagonal squared is x² + y² + z².

We need to minimize this given that xy + yz + zx=27 and xyz=23.

Let me consider the expression x² + y² + z².

We can write this as (x + y + z)^2 - 2(xy + yz + zx)=S² -54.

So, to minimize x² + y² + z², we need to minimize S².

So, how can we find the minimal S?

We have constraints: S² -54 and xyz=23.

But I don't see an immediate way to relate S and P.

Alternatively, perhaps use the AM >= GM inequality on S.

Wait, S =x + y + z >= 3*(xyz)^{1/3}=3*(23)^{1/3}≈3*2.843≈8.53.

But as we saw earlier, from the other inequality, S >=9.

So, minimal S is 9, but we saw that when S=9, the cubic equation has only one real root.

Thus, the minimal S must be greater than 9.

But how to find it?

Alternatively, perhaps consider that for a given surface area and volume, the minimal space diagonal occurs when the box is as close to a cube as possible.

But in our case, the volume is less than that of a cube with surface area 54, so the minimal space diagonal might be when two sides are equal, and the third is adjusted to meet the volume constraint.

Which is what we did earlier.

But that leads to an irrational r².

Hmm, perhaps I need to accept that and check if I can express r² as a fraction.

Wait, let me compute 27171 and 4032.

Are they both divisible by 3?

27171 ÷3=9057, 4032 ÷3=1344.

So, we can factor 3:

(27171 -4032sqrt(6))/2116=3*(9057 -1344sqrt(6))/2116.

But 2116=4*529=4*23².

Check if 9057 and 1344 have common factors with 2116.

But 2116's prime factors are 2² and 23².

9057 ÷23=9057/23=393.782... Not integer.

1344 ÷23≈58.43, not integer.

So, the fraction is (9057 -1344sqrt(6))/(2116/3)= (9057 -1344sqrt(6))/(705.333...).

Not helpful.

Alternatively, perhaps the minimal occurs when variables are not equal, and the expression simplifies to a rational number.

But I can't see how.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the initial substitution.

Let me try setting variables as a, a, and b, as before.

Given:

2(a² +ab)=54 ⇒ a² +ab=27.

Volume: a² b=23 ⇒ b=23/(a²).

Substitute into a² +ab=27:

a² +a*(23/a²)=27 ⇒a² +23/a=27 ⇒a³ -27a +23=0.

Wait, wait, earlier I thought a^3 -27a +46=0, but now it's a^3 -27a +23=0.

Wait, no, let me recheck.

Wait, surface area when x=y=a, z=b:

Surface area=2(a² +ab +ab)=2a² +4ab=54 ⇒a² +2ab=27.

Volume: a^2 b=23 ⇒b=23/a².

Substitute into a² +2a*(23/a²)=27 ⇒a² +46/a=27 ⇒a³ -27a +46=0.

Ah, I see, I had it correct earlier. So, the cubic is a^3 -27a +46=0.

So, solutions are a=2 and a=(-2 ±sqrt(4 + 4*46))/2=(-2 ±sqrt(188))/2=(-2 ±2sqrt(47))/2=-1 ±sqrt(47).

But a must be positive, so a=2 or a=-1 +sqrt(47).

Wait, sqrt(47)≈6.855, so -1 +6.855≈5.855.

Wait, but earlier I thought a=2sqrt(6)-1≈3.898, but that was when I set x=y=2sqrt(6)-1, but that led to a different cubic.

Wait, no, perhaps I made a mistake earlier.

Wait, when I set x=y, the cubic equation is a^3 -27a +46=0, which has roots a=2 and a=(-2 ±sqrt(4 + 4*46))/2= (-2 ±sqrt(188))/2= (-2 ± 2sqrt(47))/2= -1 ± sqrt(47).

Thus, a=2 or a≈5.855.

But then, for a=2, z=23/(2²)=5.75.

For a≈5.855, z=23/(a²)≈23/(34.28)≈0.671.

So, dimensions would be a≈5.855, a≈5.855, z≈0.671.

Compute x² + y² + z²=2*(5.855)^2 + (0.671)^2≈2*34.28 +0.45≈68.56 +0.45≈69.01.

r²=69.01/4≈17.25.

But earlier, when a=2, x² + y² + z²≈41.0625, which is less than 69.01.

Wait, so the minimal x² + y² + z² is 41.0625, which is when a=2.

Wait, but when a=2, x=y=2, z=5.75.

But earlier, I thought the minimal occurs when a=2sqrt(6)-1≈3.898, which leads to a smaller x² + y² + z²≈32.684, but that seems conflicting.

Wait, no, in this case, the cubic equation when x=y leads to a=2 and a≈5.855, but when I set x=y=2sqrt(6)-1≈3.898, perhaps that was a different approach.

Wait, no, I think I made a mistake earlier. The correct cubic equation when x=y is a^3 -27a +46=0, which has roots a=2 and a=-1 ±sqrt(47).

Thus, the only real positive roots are a=2 and a≈5.855.

Thus, the minimal x² + y² + z² is when a=2, which gives x² + y² + z²=4 +4 + (5.75)^2=8 +33.0625=41.0625.

Thus, r²=41.0625/4=10.265625=657/64.

Wait, because 41.0625=657/16, so divided by 4 is 657/(16*4)=657/64.

Yes, 657 and 64 are coprime because 64 is 2^6 and 657 is divisible by 3 (6+5+7=18), so 657=3*219=3*3*73. 73 is prime. So, 657 and 64 share no common factors.

Thus, p=657, q=64, p+q=657+64=721.

Wait, but earlier when I thought x=y=2sqrt(6)-1, that led to a different cubic equation, but perhaps that was incorrect.

Wait, no, let's re-examine that.

When I set x=y=2sqrt(6)-1, I found that x≈3.898, z≈1.514.

But when I substituted into the cubic equation, I got a different equation, but perhaps that was incorrect.

Wait, let me check: when x=y=2sqrt(6)-1, then:

Surface area: 2(x² +2xz)=54 ⇒x² +2xz=27.

Volume: x² z=23 ⇒z=23/x².

Substituting into x² +2x*(23/x²)=27 ⇒x² +46/x=27.

Multiply by x: x³ +46=27x ⇒x³ -27x +46=0.

Which is the same as the equation we had when setting x=y.

Thus, the roots are x=2 and x=-1 ±sqrt(47).

Thus, the only real positive roots are x=2 and x≈5.855.

Thus, the minimal occurs when x=2, giving r²=657/64.

Thus, the answer is 657 +64=721.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The problem involves finding the radius \( r \) of the smallest sphere that can contain any rectangular box with a surface area of 54 and a volume of 23. The radius squared, \( r^2 \), is expressed as a fraction \( \frac{p}{q} \), and we need to find \( p + q \).

1. **Define Variables and Constraints**:
   - Let the dimensions of the rectangular box be \( x, y, z \).
   - Surface area: \( 2(xy + yz + zx) = 54 \) ⇒ \( xy + yz + zx = 27 \).
   - Volume: \( xyz = 23 \).

2. **Space Diagonal and Sphere Radius**:
   - The space diagonal of the box is \( \sqrt{x^2 + y^2 + z^2} \).
   - The radius \( r \) of the sphere is half the space diagonal: \( r = \frac{\sqrt{x^2 + y^2 + z^2}}{2} \).
   - Thus, \( r^2 = \frac{x^2 + y^2 + z^2}{4} \).

3. **Minimizing \( x^2 + y^2 + z^2 \)**:
   - Using the identity \( (x + y + z)^2 = x^2 + y^2 + z^2 + 2(xy + yz + zx) \), we rewrite \( x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = (x + y + z)^2 - 54 \).
   - To minimize \( x^2 + y^2 + z^2 \), we need to minimize \( (x + y + z)^2 \).

4. **Assume Symmetry**:
   - Assume \( x = y \). Then, the surface area becomes \( x^2 + 2xz = 27 \) and the volume becomes \( x^2 z = 23 \).
   - Solving for \( z \) from the volume equation: \( z = \frac{23}{x^2} \).
   - Substitute into the surface area equation: \( x^2 + 2x \cdot \frac{23}{x^2} = 27 \) ⇒ \( x^3 - 27x + 46 = 0 \).

5. **Solve the Cubic Equation**:
   - The cubic equation \( x^3 - 27x + 46 = 0 \) has roots \( x = 2 \) and \( x = -1 \pm \sqrt{47} \).
   - Only positive roots are considered: \( x = 2 \) and \( x \approx 5.855 \).

6. **Calculate Dimensions and \( r^2 \)**:
   - For \( x = 2 \), \( z = \frac{23}{2^2} = 5.75 \).
   - Compute \( x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = 2(2^2) + (5.75)^2 = 8 + 33.0625 = 41.0625 \).
   - Thus, \( r^2 = \frac{41.0625}{4} = \frac{657}{64} \).

7. **Express \( r^2 \) as \( \frac{p}{q} \)**:
   - \( p = 657 \) and \( q = 64 \), which are coprime.
   - Therefore, \( p + q = 657 + 64 = 721 \).

**Answer**:  
\boxed{721}
