Okay, so I need to solve this math problem about Aya's morning walk. Let me read it again and try to understand what's being asked.

Aya walks 9 kilometers every morning. She sometimes walks at a speed of 's' km/h and sometimes at 's + 2' km/h. Each walk includes a stop at a coffee shop where she spends 't' minutes. 

The problem gives me two scenarios:

1. When she walks at speed 's', the entire walk (including the coffee stop) takes 4 hours. But wait, that can't be right because 4 hours walking at 's' km/h would mean she walks 4s kilometers, but the problem says it's 9 km. Hmm, maybe I misread.

Wait, no. Let me read again. "When she walks at a constant speed of s kilometers per hour, the walk takes her 4 hours, including t minutes spent in the coffee shop." Oh okay, so the total time is 4 hours, which includes both the walking time and the coffee stop time 't'. Similarly, when she walks at s+2 km/h, the total time is 2 hours and 24 minutes, including the same 't' minutes.

And the question is, if she walks at s + 1/2 km/h, how much time will the walk take, including 't' minutes?

Alright, so I think I need to set up some equations based on the given information.

First, let's convert all times to hours because the speed is in km/h. 

In the first scenario:
- Walking speed = s km/h
- Total time (walking + coffee) = 4 hours
- Distance walked = 9 km

So, the time she spends walking is 9 / s hours. But the total time is 4 hours, which includes 't' minutes. Since 't' is in minutes, I should convert it to hours. Let's denote 't' minutes as t/60 hours.

So, the equation for the first scenario is:
Walking time + coffee time = total time
9/s + t/60 = 4

Similarly, in the second scenario:
- Walking speed = s + 2 km/h
- Total time = 2 hours 24 minutes. Let me convert 24 minutes to hours: 24/60 = 0.4 hours. So total time is 2.4 hours.
- Distance walked is still 9 km.

So, walking time is 9 / (s + 2) hours, and coffee time is t/60 hours. The equation is:
9/(s + 2) + t/60 = 2.4

Now I have two equations:

1. 9/s + t/60 = 4
2. 9/(s + 2) + t/60 = 2.4

I can solve these two equations to find 's' and 't'. Once I have 's', I can find the time when she walks at s + 1/2 km/h.

Let me write the equations again:

Equation 1: 9/s + t/60 = 4
Equation 2: 9/(s + 2) + t/60 = 2.4

I can subtract Equation 2 from Equation 1 to eliminate 't'.

So, (9/s - 9/(s+2)) + (t/60 - t/60) = 4 - 2.4
Which simplifies to: 9/s - 9/(s + 2) = 1.6

Let me compute 9/s - 9/(s + 2). I can factor out 9:

9 [1/s - 1/(s + 2)] = 1.6

Compute the expression inside the brackets:

1/s - 1/(s + 2) = ( (s + 2) - s ) / [s(s + 2)] = 2 / [s(s + 2)]

So the equation becomes:

9 * (2 / [s(s + 2)]) ) = 1.6
=> 18 / [s(s + 2)] = 1.6

So, 18 = 1.6 * s(s + 2)

Let me compute 1.6 * s(s + 2) = 18

First, 1.6 is equal to 8/5, so maybe it's easier to write it as fractions.

18 = (8/5) * s(s + 2)

Multiply both sides by 5 to eliminate the denominator:

18 * 5 = 8 * s(s + 2)
90 = 8s(s + 2)

Divide both sides by 2 to simplify:

45 = 4s(s + 2)

So, 4s^2 + 8s = 45
=> 4s^2 + 8s - 45 = 0

This is a quadratic equation in terms of 's'. Let me write it as:

4s² + 8s - 45 = 0

I can solve this using the quadratic formula. The quadratic formula is s = [ -b ± sqrt(b² - 4ac) ] / (2a)

Here, a = 4, b = 8, c = -45

So, discriminant D = b² - 4ac = 64 - 4 * 4 * (-45) = 64 + 720 = 784

sqrt(784) = 28

So, s = [ -8 ± 28 ] / (2 * 4 ) = [ -8 ± 28 ] / 8

We can have two solutions:

1. [ -8 + 28 ] / 8 = 20 /8 = 2.5
2. [ -8 -28 ] /8 = -36 /8 = -4.5

But speed can't be negative, so s = 2.5 km/h

Wait, is this correct? Because 2.5 km/h is a pretty slow walking speed, but maybe it's okay.

Now that I have s = 2.5 km/h, let me find 't' using one of the original equations. Let's use Equation 1:

9/s + t/60 = 4

Plug s = 2.5:

9 / 2.5 + t/60 = 4

9 divided by 2.5 is equal to 3.6, because 2.5 * 3.6 = 9.

So, 3.6 + t/60 = 4

Subtract 3.6 from both sides:

t/60 = 0.4

Multiply both sides by 60:

t = 0.4 * 60 = 24 minutes

So, t is 24 minutes.

Wait, but let me check with the second equation to ensure there are no mistakes.

Equation 2: 9/(s + 2) + t/60 = 2.4

s + 2 = 2.5 + 2 = 4.5 km/h

9 /4.5 = 2 hours.

t/60 = 24/60 = 0.4 hours.

So, 2 + 0.4 = 2.4 hours, which matches the given data. So that's correct.

Now, the question is: if Aya walks at s + 1/2 km/h, how much time does she take, including 't' minutes?

s = 2.5 km/h, so s + 1/2 = 2.5 + 0.5 = 3 km/h.

So, walking speed is 3 km/h.

The distance is 9 km, so walking time is 9 / 3 = 3 hours.

Plus the coffee time, which is 24 minutes.

So total time is 3 hours + 24 minutes.

Convert 3 hours to minutes: 180 minutes. 180 + 24 = 204 minutes.

Alternatively, in hours, it's 3 hours and 24 minutes, but the question asks for the number of minutes, so 204 minutes.

Wait, let me double-check the calculations.

s = 2.5 km/h.

s + 1/2 = 3 km/h.

Time walking: 9 /3 = 3 hours.

t = 24 minutes.

Total time: 3 hours 24 minutes, which is 3*60 +24 = 180 +24=204 minutes.

Yes, that's correct.

So, the answer is 204 minutes.

To solve the problem, we first set up equations based on the given scenarios.

When Aya walks at speed \( s \) km/h, the total time is 4 hours:
\[
\frac{9}{s} + \frac{t}{60} = 4
\]

When she walks at \( s + 2 \) km/h, the total time is 2 hours and 24 minutes (which is 2.4 hours):
\[
\frac{9}{s + 2} + \frac{t}{60} = 2.4
\]

Subtracting the second equation from the first to eliminate \( t \):
\[
\frac{9}{s} - \frac{9}{s + 2} = 1.6
\]
Simplifying:
\[
9 \left( \frac{2}{s(s + 2)} \right) = 1.6 \implies \frac{18}{s(s + 2)} = 1.6
\]
\[
18 = 1.6 \cdot s(s + 2) \implies 90 = 8s(s + 2) \implies 4s^2 + 8s - 45 = 0
\]

Solving the quadratic equation \( 4s^2 + 8s - 45 = 0 \) using the quadratic formula:
\[
s = \frac{-8 \pm \sqrt{784}}{8} = \frac{-8 \pm 28}{8}
\]
We take the positive root:
\[
s = \frac{20}{8} = 2.5 \text{ km/h}
\]

Using \( s = 2.5 \) in the first equation to find \( t \):
\[
\frac{9}{2.5} + \frac{t}{60} = 4 \implies 3.6 + \frac{t}{60} = 4 \implies \frac{t}{60} = 0.4 \implies t = 24 \text{ minutes}
\]

When Aya walks at \( s + \frac{1}{2} = 3 \) km/h, the walking time is:
\[
\frac{9}{3} = 3 \text{ hours} = 180 \text{ minutes}
\]
Adding the coffee stop:
\[
180 + 24 = 204 \text{ minutes}
\]

The total time is \(\boxed{204}\) minutes.
