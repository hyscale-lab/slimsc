Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the number of triples of nonnegative integers (a, b, c) that satisfy two conditions: a + b + c = 300 and a²b + a²c + b²a + b²c + c²a + c²b = 6,000,000. Hmm, this seems a bit challenging, but I'll try to break it down step by step.

First, let me write down the given equations:

1. a + b + c = 300
2. a²b + a²c + b²a + b²c + c²a + c²b = 6,000,000

I need to find all nonnegative integer solutions (a, b, c) that satisfy both equations.

Looking at the second equation, I notice that it's symmetric in a, b, and c. That probably means that the variables can be interchanged, so maybe there's a way to simplify it by using some symmetric properties or by substitution.

Let me try to factor the second equation. Let's see:

a²b + a²c + b²a + b²c + c²a + c²b

I can factor terms as follows:

= a²(b + c) + b²(a + c) + c²(a + b)

Hmm, since a + b + c = 300, I can substitute (b + c) with (300 - a), (a + c) with (300 - b), and (a + b) with (300 - c). Let me do that.

So, the second equation becomes:

a²(300 - a) + b²(300 - b) + c²(300 - c) = 6,000,000

That's a bit simpler. Let me write this as:

300a² - a³ + 300b² - b³ + 300c² - c³ = 6,000,000

I can factor out the 300:

300(a² + b² + c²) - (a³ + b³ + c³) = 6,000,000

Hmm, maybe I can find expressions for a² + b² + c² and a³ + b³ + c³ in terms of a + b + c.

I know that (a + b + c)² = a² + b² + c² + 2(ab + bc + ac). Since a + b + c = 300, this gives:

300² = a² + b² + c² + 2(ab + bc + ac)
90,000 = a² + b² + c² + 2(ab + bc + ac)

So, a² + b² + c² = 90,000 - 2(ab + bc + ac)

Let me denote S = a + b + c = 300, Q = ab + bc + ac, and P = abc.

Wait, maybe I can express a³ + b³ + c³ in terms of S, Q, and P as well. I remember that:

a³ + b³ + c³ = (a + b + c)^3 - 3(a + b + c)(ab + bc + ac) + 3abc
= S³ - 3 S Q + 3 P

So, plugging in the values:

a³ + b³ + c³ = 300³ - 3*300*Q + 3P

Which is:

= 27,000,000 - 900 Q + 3P

Now, going back to the equation we had earlier:

300(a² + b² + c²) - (a³ + b³ + c³) = 6,000,000

Substituting a² + b² + c² = 90,000 - 2 Q and a³ + b³ + c³ = 27,000,000 - 900 Q + 3 P:

300*(90,000 - 2 Q) - (27,000,000 - 900 Q + 3 P) = 6,000,000

Let me compute each term step by step.

First, 300*(90,000 - 2 Q) = 300*90,000 - 300*2 Q = 27,000,000 - 600 Q

Then, subtracting the other terms:

27,000,000 - 600 Q - 27,000,000 + 900 Q - 3 P = 6,000,000

Simplify the left side:

(27,000,000 - 27,000,000) + (-600 Q + 900 Q) - 3 P = 6,000,000

So:

0 + 300 Q - 3 P = 6,000,000

Which simplifies to:

300 Q - 3 P = 6,000,000

Divide both sides by 3:

100 Q - P = 2,000,000

So, P = 100 Q - 2,000,000

Now, remember that S = 300, Q = ab + bc + ac, and P = abc.

So, we have P = 100 Q - 2,000,000.

Hmm, I can think of this as a system of equations involving S, Q, and P.

So, to recap:

S = 300

Q = ab + bc + ac

P = abc = 100 Q - 2,000,000

But I also know that for three variables a, b, c, the monic cubic polynomial with roots a, b, c is:

x³ - S x² + Q x - P = 0

Which becomes:

x³ - 300 x² + Q x - (100 Q - 2,000,000) = 0

Simplify the constants:

x³ - 300 x² + Q x - 100 Q + 2,000,000 = 0

Factor the terms with Q:

x³ - 300 x² + Q(x - 100) + 2,000,000 = 0

Hmm, not sure if this helps directly. Maybe I can think of Q in terms of S and other variables.

Alternatively, perhaps I can find possible integer solutions for a, b, c. Since a, b, c are nonnegative integers and their sum is 300, they can't be too large. Also, the second equation is 6,000,000, so maybe the values of a, b, c are such that a, b, c are not too small either.

Wait, maybe I can think about variables being equal or having some symmetry. For example, if two variables are equal, perhaps that can help reduce the problem.

Alternatively, perhaps assume that a ≥ b ≥ c. Since the problem is symmetric, we can count the number of ordered triples, but since it's symmetric, perhaps we can count the number of unordered triples and then multiply by the number of permutations, but wait, unless there are duplicates.

Alternatively, maybe it's easier to think in terms of variables that sum to 300 and with the given product condition.

Wait, another approach: Let me denote x = a, y = b, z = c. Then, x + y + z = 300, and we have the equation involving x²y + x²z + y²x + y²z + z²x + z²y = 6,000,000.

Alternatively, I can factor this as follows:

x²(y + z) + y²(x + z) + z²(x + y) = 6,000,000

But since x + y + z = 300, y + z = 300 - x, x + z = 300 - y, and x + y = 300 - z.

So, the equation becomes:

x²(300 - x) + y²(300 - y) + z²(300 - z) = 6,000,000

Which is the same as the equation I had earlier.

Hmm. So, perhaps I can think about each term x²(300 - x). Maybe this function is convex or has certain properties that can help me bound the possible values of x, y, z.

Alternatively, perhaps I can consider using Lagrange multipliers, but since we're dealing with integers, that might not directly help, but maybe gives some intuition.

Wait, let's consider the function f(t) = t²(300 - t). Let's find its maximum. Taking derivative:

f'(t) = 2t(300 - t) - t² = 600t - 2t² - t² = 600t - 3t².

Setting to zero: 600t - 3t² = 0 → t(600 - 3t) = 0 → t=0 or t=200.

So the maximum of f(t) occurs at t=200, f(200) = 200² * 100 = 40000 * 100 = 4,000,000.

So each term x²(300 - x) is at most 4,000,000. Since the sum is 6,000,000, that suggests that each variable can't be too large or too small.

Wait, if all three variables were 200, then each term would be 4,000,000, but their sum would be 12,000,000, which is way above 6,000,000. So, that's not going to happen.

Alternatively, maybe two variables are 200, and the third is 0. Let's test that. Let's say a=200, b=200, c=0.

Then, a + b + c = 400, which is more than 300, so that's invalid.

Wait, so the maximum sum of a, b, c is 300, so the maximum any single variable can be is 300.

Wait, but when a=200, the other variables can be up to 100, but let's see.

Wait, perhaps a=100, b=100, c=100.

Then, each x²(300 -x) would be 100² * 200 = 10,000 * 200 = 2,000,000. So the sum is 6,000,000, which is exactly the desired value.

So, (a, b, c) = (100, 100, 100) is a solution.

Are there other solutions? Let's see.

Suppose two variables are 100, and the third is 100 as well, so that's the same as above.

Wait, what if one of them is 200, and the other two sum to 100.

Let me try a=200, then b + c = 100.

So, let's compute the sum:

a²(b + c) + b²(a + c) + c²(a + b)

= 200² * 100 + b²(200 + c) + c²(200 + b)

= 40,000 * 100 + b²(200 + c) + c²(200 + b)

= 4,000,000 + [b²(200 + c) + c²(200 + b)]

We need this to equal 6,000,000, so the sum in the brackets must be 2,000,000.

But since b + c = 100, let's let b = 100 - c.

So, substituting b = 100 - c, we get:

Sum = (100 - c)^2 (200 + c) + c^2 (200 + (100 - c))

Simplify each term:

First term: (100 - c)^2 (200 + c) = (10,000 - 200c + c²)(200 + c)

Second term: c² (300 - c)

This seems a bit complicated, but maybe I can compute it for specific c values.

Alternatively, perhaps c=0: Then b=100.

Sum becomes (100)^2*(200 + 0) + 0 = 10,000 * 200 = 2,000,000. So total sum becomes 4,000,000 + 2,000,000 = 6,000,000. So (200, 100, 0) is a solution.

Similarly, any permutation of this, like (200, 0, 100), (100, 200, 0), etc., would also be solutions.

Wait, so if one variable is 200, another is 100, and the third is 0, that works.

So, another set of solutions is permutations of (200, 100, 0).

How many such triples are there?

Since the variables are nonnegative integers, the number of permutations would be 3! / 1! (since all are distinct). Wait, no: 200, 100, 0 are all distinct, so there are 3! = 6 permutations.

But wait, let me check: if two variables are the same, then the number of permutations would be less. But in this case, 200, 100, 0 are all distinct, so each permutation is unique. So, 6 solutions from this case.

Now, let's see if there are other solutions beyond the case where one variable is 200, another is 100, and the third is 0.

Wait, earlier we found that (100, 100, 100) is a solution. Are there other triples where all three variables are equal? Let's check.

Suppose a = b = c. Then, a + a + a = 3a = 300 → a = 100. So, that's the only case where all three variables are equal, which gives (100, 100, 100).

Now, let's see if there are other cases where two variables are equal, say a = b, and c is different.

Let me assume that a = b, so then 2a + c = 300 → c = 300 - 2a.

Now, substituting into the second equation:

a²b + a²c + b²a + b²c + c²a + c²b = 6,000,000

Since a = b, this simplifies to:

a²a + a²c + a²a + a²c + c²a + c²a

= 2a³ + 2a²c + 2a c²

Factor out 2a:

2a(a² + a c + c²) = 6,000,000

Divide both sides by 2:

a(a² + a c + c²) = 3,000,000

But since c = 300 - 2a, let's substitute that in:

a [a² + a(300 - 2a) + (300 - 2a)^2 ] = 3,000,000

Simplify inside the brackets:

= a [ a² + 300a - 2a² + (300)^2 - 4*300 a + (2a)^2 ]

Wait, perhaps expanding (300 - 2a)^2 correctly:

(300 - 2a)^2 = 90,000 - 1,200a + 4a²

So, putting it all together inside the brackets:

a² + a*(300 - 2a) + (90,000 - 1,200a + 4a²)
= a² + 300a - 2a² + 90,000 - 1,200a + 4a²
= (a² - 2a² + 4a²) + (300a - 1,200a) + 90,000
= (3a²) + (-900a) + 90,000

So, the equation becomes:

a [3a² - 900a + 90,000] = 3,000,000

Let me expand this:

3a³ - 900a² + 90,000a = 3,000,000

Divide both sides by 3:

a³ - 300a² + 30,000a = 1,000,000

Bring all terms to one side:

a³ - 300a² + 30,000a - 1,000,000 = 0

Hmm, that's a cubic equation. Let me try to find integer roots. Maybe using rational root theorem. Possible roots are factors of 1,000,000 divided by factors of 1, so possible roots are ±1, ±2, ..., up to 1000, but it's a bit time-consuming.

Alternatively, maybe I can guess a solution. Let's try a=100:

100³ - 300*(100)^2 + 30,000*100 - 1,000,000
= 1,000,000 - 3,000,000 + 3,000,000 - 1,000,000
= 0

So a=100 is a root. So, we can factor (a - 100) from the cubic.

Using polynomial division or synthetic division:

Divide a³ - 300a² + 30,000a - 1,000,000 by (a - 100).

Using synthetic division:

100 | 1   -300    30,000    -1,000,000
           100    -20,000      1,000,000
       --------------------------------
           1    -200     10,000         0

So, the cubic factors as (a - 100)(a² - 200a + 10,000) = 0

Set each factor to zero:

a = 100

or

a² - 200a + 10,000 = 0

Solve the quadratic equation:

a = [200 ± sqrt(40,000 - 40,000)] / 2 = [200 ± 0]/2 = 100

So, the only real roots are a=100, a=100, and a=100. Wait, that can't be right. Wait, the quadratic would have a discriminant of (200)^2 - 4*1*10,000 = 40,000 - 40,000 = 0, so a double root at a=100.

Wait, so the cubic equation has a triple root at a=100. That means when a=100, the equation holds.

So, in this case, when a = 100, then c = 300 - 2a = 300 - 200 = 100. So, the triple is (100, 100, 100), which we already knew.

So, in the case where a = b, the only solution is when all are 100.

So, no other solutions come from the case where two variables are equal except for the all-equal case.

Hmm, perhaps I need to consider cases where two variables are equal, but not all three. Maybe I missed something.

Wait, let's try the case where two variables are zero. Suppose c=0, then we have a + b = 300, and the equation becomes:

a²b + a²*0 + b²a + b²*0 + 0 + 0 = a²b + b²a = ab(a + b) = ab * 300 = 6,000,000

Wait, because a + b = 300.

So, ab * 300 = 6,000,000 → ab = 20,000.

So, a + b = 300, ab = 20,000.

We can solve for a and b. The quadratic equation would be x² - 300x + 20,000 = 0.

Discriminant: 90,000 - 80,000 = 10,000.

Solutions: [300 ± 100]/2 → 400/2=200 and 200/2=100.

So, a=200, b=100 or a=100, b=200. So, we get the triples (200, 100, 0), (100, 200, 0), etc.

Wait, but this is the same as the earlier solution where one variable is 200, another is 100, and the third is 0. So, these are the same solutions we found earlier.

So, in this case, that's covered in the c=0 case, which gives us permutations of (200, 100, 0).

So, so far, the solutions we have are:

1. (100, 100, 100) → 1 solution (since all are same, no permutations)
2. All permutations of (200, 100, 0) → 6 solutions

Are there any other solutions where none of the variables are zero?

Let me check another case. Suppose two variables are equal but not all three, but not the case where a = b as we checked before, which only gave the all-equal case.

Alternatively, maybe we can look for other triples where a, b, c are distinct and none are zero.

Wait, let's try a=150, b=150, c=0. Then a + b + c = 300.

Compute the second equation:

a²b + a²c + b²a + b²c + c²a + c²b
= 150²*150 + 150²*0 + 150²*150 + 150²*0 + 0 + 0
= 2*(150^3)
= 2*(3,375,000) = 6,750,000, which is more than 6,000,000. So that's too big.

Hmm, perhaps trying a=150, b=100, c=50.

Check a + b + c = 300? 150+100+50=300. Yes.

Now, compute the second equation:

a²b + a²c + b²a + b²c + c²a + c²b
= 150²*100 + 150²*50 + 100²*150 + 100²*50 + 50²*150 + 50²*100

Compute each term:

150²=22,500
22,500 * 100 = 2,250,000
22,500 * 50 = 1,125,000
100²=10,000
10,000 * 150 = 1,500,000
10,000 * 50 = 500,000
50²=2,500
2,500 * 150 = 375,000
2,500 * 100 = 250,000

Sum them all:

2,250,000 + 1,125,000 = 3,375,000
1,500,000 + 500,000 = 2,000,000
375,000 + 250,000 = 625,000
Total sum: 3,375,000 + 2,000,000 = 5,375,000 + 625,000 = 6,000,000

Oh! So, this triple (150, 100, 50) also satisfies the equation.

Wait, that's interesting. So, that's another solution. Let's check if this is correct.

Yes, when I compute each term, the sum is 6,000,000. So, (150, 100, 50) is a solution.

Now, are there other triples like this?

Wait, let me think about how this works. So, (150, 100, 50) is a solution, but are their permutations also solutions?

Let me check another permutation: (150, 50, 100). Let's compute the sum.

a=150, b=50, c=100.

Compute each term:

a²b = 150² *50 = 22,500 *50=1,125,000
a²c = 22,500 *100=2,250,000
b²a = 50² *150=2,500 *150=375,000
b²c = 2,500 *100=250,000
c²a = 100² *150=10,000 *150=1,500,000
c²b = 10,000 *50=500,000

Now, sum all:

1,125,000 + 2,250,000 = 3,375,000
375,000 + 250,000 = 625,000
1,500,000 + 500,000 = 2,000,000

Adding together: 3,375,000 + 625,000 = 4,000,000 + 2,000,000 = 6,000,000.

Yes, so (150,50,100) is also a solution. So, all permutations of (150,100,50) will be solutions.

So, how many permutations are there? Since all three numbers are distinct, the number of permutations is 3! =6.

Wait, that's 6 more solutions.

So, now we have:

1. (100,100,100) → 1 solution
2. All permutations of (200,100,0) →6 solutions
3. All permutations of (150,100,50) →6 solutions

Are there any more solutions?

Let me think if there are other triples that satisfy the conditions.

Wait, perhaps other triples where the numbers are in a different ratio.

Wait, let me think about the equation again.

We have P = 100 Q - 2,000,000.

But P = abc, and Q = ab + bc + ac.

So, abc = 100(ab + bc + ac) - 2,000,000.

Let me write this as:

abc - 100(ab + bc + ac) = -2,000,000

Hmm, perhaps factor this.

Wait, maybe we can factor this expression. Let's see:

abc - 100(ab + bc + ac) = ab(c - 100) - 100 c (a + b)

But a + b + c = 300, so a + b = 300 - c.

So, substituting:

= ab(c - 100) - 100 c (300 - c)
= ab(c - 100) - 100c (300 - c)

Hmm, not sure if that helps.

Alternatively, perhaps I can write this as:

abc - 100ab - 100ac - 100bc = -2,000,000

Let me add 100^3 to both sides to see if that helps:

abc - 100ab - 100ac - 100bc + 100^3 = -2,000,000 + 100^3

= -2,000,000 + 1,000,000 = -1,000,000

Hmm, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps factor (a - 100)(b - 100)(c - 100). Let me compute that:

(a - 100)(b - 100)(c - 100) = abc -100ab -100ac -100bc + 10000a + 10000b + 10000c - 1,000,000

But that seems more complicated. Not sure if that helps.

Alternatively, perhaps I can write:

abc - 100(ab + bc + ac) = -2,000,000

Let me factor 100:

abc = 100(ab + bc + ac) - 2,000,000

Hmm, maybe I can write this as:

abc = 100(ab + bc + ac) - 2,000,000

Divide both sides by abc (assuming abc ≠ 0):

1 = 100(ab + bc + ac)/(abc) - 2,000,000/(abc)

Which simplifies to:

1 = 100(1/c + 1/a + 1/b) - 2,000,000/(abc)

But that might not be helpful for integer solutions.

Alternatively, maybe I can let x = a, y = b, z = c, and think about possible integer solutions where x, y, z are positive integers summing to 300 and satisfying that equation.

But perhaps it's better to think in terms of variables that are multiples of 50, given that the earlier solutions involved 100, 150, 200, etc., which are multiples of 50.

Wait, perhaps all solutions have a, b, c as multiples of 50.

Let me check the solutions we have so far:

- (100,100,100): multiples of 50
- (200,100,0): 200, 100 are multiples of 50, 0 is allowed
- (150,100,50): all multiples of 50

So, perhaps all solutions can be found by scaling down by 50, leading to a, b, c in {0,1,2,3} after scaling, but let me check.

Wait, for example, (150,100,50) would scale down to (3,2,1).

Similarly, (200,100,0) scales to (4,2,0).

And (100,100,100) scales to (2,2,2).

Let me see if this scaling can help.

Let me define a' = a/50, b' = b/50, c' = c/50. Then, a', b', c' are nonnegative integers, and a' + b' + c' = 6 (since 300/50=6).

Now, substituting into the second equation:

a²b + a²c + b²a + b²c + c²a + c²b = 6,000,000

Expressed in terms of a', b', c':

(50a')²(50b') + (50a')²(50c') + (50b')²(50a') + (50b')²(50c') + (50c')²(50a') + (50c')²(50b') = 6,000,000

Simplify each term:

= 50² * a'² * 50 b' + 50² * a'² * 50 c' + ... etc.

Each term is 50^3 a'^2 b', etc.

So, the sum becomes:

6 * 50^3 (a'^2 b' + a'^2 c' + b'^2 a' + b'^2 c' + c'^2 a' + c'^2 b') = 6,000,000

Compute 6 * 50^3:

6 * 125,000 = 750,000

So:

750,000 (a'^2 b' + a'^2 c' + b'^2 a' + b'^2 c' + c'^2 a' + c'^2 b') = 6,000,000

Divide both sides by 750,000:

a'^2 b' + a'^2 c' + b'^2 a' + b'^2 c' + c'^2 a' + c'^2 b' = 8

So, now the problem is reduced to finding nonnegative integers a', b', c' such that:

a' + b' + c' =6

and

a'^2 b' + a'^2 c' + b'^2 a' + b'^2 c' + c'^2 a' + c'^2 b' =8

This seems more manageable.

Now, let's find all triples (a', b', c') of nonnegative integers where a' + b' + c' =6 and the sum of the terms equals 8.

We can list all possible triples where a', b', c' are nonnegative integers summing to 6, and check which ones satisfy the second condition.

Given that a', b', c' are nonnegative integers summing to 6, and the sum is small, perhaps we can find all possible triples.

Let's start by considering the possible values for a', b', c'.

But since the sum is small (8), perhaps the variables can't be too large.

First, note that a', b', c' are nonnegative integers, and their sum is 6.

So, possible values for a', b', c' can be from 0 up to 6.

Let me consider all possible ordered triples (a', b', c') where a' + b' + c' =6, and compute the sum S = a²b + a²c + b²a + b²c + c²a + c²b.

We need S=8.

Let me list the possible triples systematically.

We can assume without loss of generality that a' ≥ b' ≥ c' to reduce the number of cases, but since the problem is symmetric, we can count all permutations later.

Let me proceed step by step.

Case 1: All variables are equal.

a' = b' = c' = 2.

Sum: 2+2+2=6.

Compute S:

Each term is 2²*2 = 4*2=8, and there are 6 terms: 6*8=48. But 48 ≠8, so this doesn't work.

Case 2: Two variables are equal, third is different.

Let me try a'=3, b'=3, c'=0. Sum=6.

Compute S:

a²b + a²c + b²a + b²c + c²a + c²b
=3²*3 +3²*0 +3²*3 +3²*0 +0²*3 +0²*3

Nope.

Wait, perhaps I missed some cases where the sum is 8.

Wait, let me think of smaller values.

Wait, what if one of the variables is 4, another is 1, and the third is 1? Wait, that's a'=4, b'=1, c'=1. Sum=6.

Compute S:

4²*1 +4²*1 +1²*4 +1²*1 +1²*4 +1²*1
=16 +16 +4 +1 +4 +1=42≠8.

Nope.

What about a'=3, b'=2, c'=1: sum=6.

But that gives sum S=48, as before.

Wait, perhaps a'=1, b'=2, c'=3.

Compute S:

1²*2 +1²*3 +2²*1 +2²*3 +3²*1 +3²*2
=2 +3 +4 +12 +9 +18=48≠8.

Nope.

Hmm, maybe the only way to get S=8 is when two variables are 2 and the third is 2, but that gives S=48, which is way higher.

Wait, perhaps one variable is 0, another is 2, and the third is 4.

Wait, a'=0, b'=2, c'=4.

Compute S:

0²*2 +0²*4 +2²*0 +2²*4 +4²*0 +4²*2
=0 +0 +0 +16 +0 +32=48≠8.

Nope.

Wait, maybe a'=1, b'=1, c'=4.

Compute S:

1²*1 +1²*4 +1²*1 +1²*4 +4²*1 +4²*1
=1 +4 +1 +4 +16 +16=42≠8.

Hmm, not helpful.

Wait, maybe there are no other solutions except the ones we found earlier. But that can't be right because we found (150,100,50) as a solution, which in terms of a', b', c' is (3,2,1).

So, let's compute S for a'=3, b'=2, c'=1.

Compute S:

3²*2 +3²*1 +2²*3 +2²*1 +1²*3 +1²*2
=9*2 +9*1 +4*3 +4*1 +1*3 +1*2
=18 +9 +12 +4 +3 +2=48.

Wait, that's 48, but earlier when we scaled up (3,2,1) by 50, we got (150,100,50), which worked. But in scaled-down terms, S=48≠8.

So, that's a contradiction. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in scaling.

Wait, no, wait: when I scaled the variables, I defined a' = a/50, etc., and then the transformed equation became S'=8, but in the example, the scaled-down variables (3,2,1) give S'=48, which is 6 times higher than 8.

Wait, that suggests that there's a mistake in my scaling.

Wait, let me recheck the scaling.

Original variables: a, b, c.

Scaled variables: a' = a/50, b' = b/50, c' = c/50.

So, a = 50a', etc.

The second equation in terms of a', b', c' is:

a²b + a²c + b²a + b²c + c²a + c²b = 6,000,000

Substituting a =50a', etc.:

(50a')² (50b') + (50a')² (50c') + (50b')² (50a') + (50b')² (50c') + (50c')² (50a') + (50c')² (50b') =6,000,000

Compute each term:

= (2500a'²)(50b') = 2500 *50 a'² b' = 125,000 a'² b'

Similarly, each term has a factor of 125,000.

So, the sum is:

125,000 (a'²b' + a'²c' + b'²a' + b'²c' + c'²a' + c'²b') =6,000,000

Divide both sides by 125,000:

(a'²b' + a'²c' + b'²a' + b'²c' + c'²a' + c'²b') =6,000,000 / 125,000 =48.

So, the transformed equation is S'=48, not 8.

Wait, that's different from what I thought earlier. I must have miscalculated earlier.

So, correct equation after scaling is:

a'^2 b' + a'^2 c' + b'^2 a' + b'^2 c' + c'^2 a' + c'^2 b' =48

Given that a' + b' + c' =6.

So, I need to find all triples (a', b', c') where a', b', c' are nonnegative integers summing to 6, and the sum of the terms equals48.

That makes more sense, because when a'=3, b'=2, c'=1, we get S'=48, which fits.

So, the problem reduces to finding all triples (a', b', c') with a' + b' + c' =6 and S'=48.

So, let's look for such triples.

We can approach this systematically.

Case 1: All variables equal. a'=b'=c'=2. Then S'=6*(2²*2)=6*8=48. So, this is a solution.

Case 2: Two variables equal, third different.

Subcase 2a: a'=3, b'=3, c'=0.

Compute S':

3²*3 +3²*0 +3²*3 +3²*0 +0²*3 +0²*3=9*3 +0 +9*3 +0 +0 +0=27+27=54≠48.

Nope.

Subcase 2b: a'=4, b'=1, c'=1.

Compute S':

4²*1 +4²*1 +1²*4 +1²*1 +1²*4 +1²*1=16+16+4+1+4+1=42≠48.

Nope.

Subcase 2c: a'=2, b'=2, c'=2. This is Case 1, which works.

Subcase 2d: a'=3, b'=2, c'=1.

Compute S':

3²*2 +3²*1 +2²*3 +2²*1 +1²*3 +1²*2=9*2 +9*1 +4*3 +4*1 +1*3 +1*2=18+9+12+4+3+2=48. Yes, works.

Subcase 2e: a'=5, b'=1, c'=0.

Compute S':

5²*1 +5²*0 +1²*5 +1²*0 +0²*5 +0²*1=25+0+5+0+0+0=30≠48.

Nope.

Subcase 2f: a'=4, b'=2, c'=0.

Compute S':

4²*2 +4²*0 +2²*4 +2²*0 +0²*4 +0²*2=16*2 +0 +4*4 +0 +0 +0=32+16=48. Yes, works.

So, another solution is (4,2,0).

Similarly, permutation of (4,2,0) would also be solutions.

So, in scaled terms, the solutions are:

1. (2,2,2) → gives (100,100,100) when scaled up
2. (3,2,1) → gives (150,100,50)
3. (4,2,0) → gives (200,100,0)

Are there any other triples?

Let me check another case.

Case 3: All variables distinct, none zero.

Let me try a'=5, b'=0, c'=1. But that's not all positive, but let's see:

Wait, a'=5, b'=0, c'=1. Sum=6.

Compute S':

5²*0 +5²*1 +0²*5 +0²*1 +1²*5 +1²*0=0 +25 +0 +0 +5 +0=30≠48.

Nope.

What about a'=3, b'=3, c'=0: already checked, sum=54≠48.

Another case: a'=3, b'=1, c'=2.

Compute S':

3²*1 +3²*2 +1²*3 +1²*2 +2²*3 +2²*1=9*1 +9*2 +1*3 +1*2 +4*3 +4*1=9+18+3+2+12+4=48. Yes, works.

So, (3,1,2) also works, which is same as (3,2,1) when permuted.

Another case: a'=2, b'=4, c'=0.

Compute S':

2²*4 +2²*0 +4²*2 +4²*0 +0²*2 +0²*4=4*4 +0 +16*2 +0 +0 +0=16+32=48. Yes, works.

So, (2,4,0) is another solution, which when scaled up gives (100, 200, 0).

Wait, so in scaled terms, the solutions are:

- (2,2,2)
- (3,2,1) and its permutations
- (4,2,0) and its permutations

So, in terms of the original variables, these correspond to:

1. (100,100,100)
2. (150,100,50) and permutations
3. (200,100,0) and permutations

So, now, let's count the number of solutions.

1. (2,2,2) in scaled terms: only 1 solution. Scaled up to (100,100,100): 1 solution.

2. (3,2,1) in scaled terms: all permutations, which are 6 in total. Each corresponds to a unique solution in the original variables. So, 6 solutions.

3. (4,2,0) in scaled terms: all permutations, which are 3! =6, but since one variable is zero, the number of unique permutations is 3 (since zero can be in any of the three positions). Wait, no: (4,2,0) has 3 distinct elements, so number of permutations is 6. But when scaling up, (4,2,0) becomes (200,100,0), and all permutations, which are 6. But wait, when a'=4, b'=2, c'=0, the scaled variables give a=200, b=100, c=0. But also, when a'=2, b'=4, c'=0, it's a=100, b=200, c=0, which is a different permutation. So, yes, 6 permutations.

Wait, but when we scaled down (200,100,0), we get (4,2,0), and all permutations of this are 6 solutions.

Similarly, for (3,2,1), all permutations are 6 solutions.

So, total solutions:

1 (from all 100s) + 6 (from 150,100,50) +6 (from 200,100,0) =13.

Wait, but wait, when I scaled down, I found that the solutions are:

- (2,2,2)
- (3,2,1) and all permutations
- (4,2,0) and all permutations

Which correspond to:

- (100,100,100)
- (150,100,50) and permutations (6 solutions)
- (200,100,0) and permutations (6 solutions)

So, that's 1 +6 +6=13 solutions.

Wait, but let me confirm if there are other scaled-down solutions.

Wait, I think that's all. Because in the scaled-down problem, any other triple either doesn't sum to 6 or doesn't give S'=48.

So, the total number of solutions is 13.

Wait, but let me make sure I didn't miss any other triples in the scaled-down problem.

Wait, another possible triple: a'=5, b'=0, c'=1. But that gives S'=30≠48.

Another case: a'=3, b'=3, c'=0: S'=54≠48.

a'=1, b'=1, c'=4: S'=42≠48.

a'=2, b'=2, c'=2: S'=48, which we already counted.

a'=4, b'=1, c'=1: S'=42≠48.

So, no, I think those are the only possible triples that satisfy both conditions in the scaled-down problem.

Thus, in the original problem, the number of triples is 13.

Wait, but wait: when I scaled down, each solution in the scaled-down problem corresponds to 3^k solutions in the original? No, actually, each solution in the scaled-down problem corresponds to exactly one solution in the original, considering all permutations.

Wait, no, because each permutation in the scaled-down problem corresponds to a unique permutation in the original.

So, for example, (3,2,1) in scaled-down corresponds to (150,100,50) in original, and all permutations of it are valid.

Similarly, (4,2,0) in scaled-down corresponds to (200,100,0) in original, and all permutations are valid.

So, in total, 1 +6 +6=13 solutions.

Wait, but wait, in the scaled-down problem, (2,2,2) is only one solution, which gives one solution in the original. The other two cases each have 6 permutations, so 6+6=12, plus 1, for total 13.

So, the total number of triples is 13.

Therefore, the answer is 13.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The number of triples is determined by analyzing the given equations and checking all possible cases. The valid solutions are:

1. (100, 100, 100) → 1 solution.
2. All permutations of (150, 100, 50) → 6 solutions.
3. All permutations of (200, 100, 0) → 6 solutions.

Adding these together gives a total of 13 solutions.

$\boxed{13}$
