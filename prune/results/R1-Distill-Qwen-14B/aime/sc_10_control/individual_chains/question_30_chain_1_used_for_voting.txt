Okay, so I have this problem to solve: I need to find the remainder when the product from k=0 to 12 of (2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k}) is divided by 1000. ω is a 13th root of unity, and it's not equal to 1. Hmm, that sounds a bit intimidating at first, but let me break it down.

First, I remember that roots of unity have some special properties. Since ω is a 13th root, ω^13 = 1, and ω^k for k=0 to 12 are all the distinct roots. So ω^0 is 1, ω^1 is ω, ω^2, up to ω^12. 

The expression I'm looking at is a product of terms from k=0 to 12. Each term is 2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k}. Let me write that out more clearly: for each k, the term is (2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k}). I need to compute the product of all these terms.

Hmm, maybe I can factor this expression somehow. Let me see. Let me consider a single term: 2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k}. Maybe I can write this as a quadratic in ω^k? Let's see:

Let x = ω^k. Then the term becomes 2 - 2x + x^2. So that's x^2 - 2x + 2. Hmm, can I factor this quadratic? Let me check the discriminant: b² - 4ac = 4 - 8 = -4. So it factors into complex numbers. Wait, but maybe that's not helpful for the product.

Alternatively, perhaps I can relate this to cyclotomic polynomials. I remember that cyclotomic polynomials have roots that are primitive roots of unity. For a 13th root, the cyclotomic polynomial is Φ₁₃(x) = x¹² + x¹¹ + ... + x + 1, since 13 is prime.

But I'm not sure how to connect this yet. Let me think differently. Since ω is a 13th root of unity, ω^k for k=0 to 12 are all the roots of x¹³ - 1 = 0. So, x¹³ - 1 = (x - 1)(x¹² + x¹¹ + ... + x + 1). That might come into play later.

Wait, maybe I can consider this product as evaluating a polynomial at certain points or something like that. Let me think: if I have a product over k=0 to 12 of (a - bω^k + cω^{2k}), perhaps there's a way to express this product in terms of another polynomial evaluated at a certain value.

Alternatively, perhaps I can manipulate the expression 2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k} into a more manageable form. Let me see: 2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k} = ω^{2k} - 2ω^k + 2. Hmm, that's the same as the quadratic in ω^k as before.

Wait, if I factor that quadratic, maybe I can write it as (ω^k - something)(ω^k - something else). But since the discriminant is negative, the roots are complex, which might not help me directly.

Another thought: maybe I can write ω^{2k} in terms of (ω^k)^2. So, 2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k} = (ω^k)^2 - 2ω^k + 2. Let me denote this as f(ω^k), where f(x) = x² - 2x + 2.

So, the product I'm looking for is the product of f(ω^k) as k ranges from 0 to 12. So, that's ∏_{k=0}^{12} f(ω^k). 

But since ω^k are all the 13th roots of unity, except that when k=0, ω^0=1. So, the product is f(1) times the product over the other 12 roots.

Wait, but the product over f(ω^k) for k=0 to 12 is the same as the product over f(x) where x runs through all the 13th roots of unity. 

So, perhaps I can use the fact that if a polynomial P(x) has roots r_1, r_2, ..., r_n, then the product of (x - r_i) is P(x). But in this case, I have the product of f(r_i), where r_i are the roots of x¹³ - 1 = 0.

Wait, another approach: the product over all f(r_i) where r_i are the roots of some polynomial can be found using the resultant or something like that. Alternatively, perhaps using the fact that the product over (a - r_i) is equal to the polynomial evaluated at a, with certain conditions.

Wait, I think for a monic polynomial P(x) with roots r_1, r_2, ..., r_n, the product of (a - r_i) is P(a). So, in this case, if P(x) = x^13 - 1, then the product of (x - r_i) for all r_i is x^13 - 1. But in our case, the product is of f(r_i) = r_i² - 2r_i + 2. Hmm, so that's not directly the same as evaluating at a point.

Wait, perhaps I can think of the product ∏_{k=0}^{12} (x^2 - 2x + 2) evaluated at x = ω^k. But that seems unclear.

Alternatively, perhaps I can express the product as the product over all 13th roots of unity of (ω^k)^2 - 2ω^k + 2. So, that's the product of f(ω^k) for each root.

But wait, if I have a polynomial f(x) = x² - 2x + 2, then the product over all roots ω^k of f(ω^k) is equal to the resultant of f(x) and the minimal polynomial of ω, which is x^13 - 1. Or perhaps it's the product of f(ω^k) for each k. Hmm, maybe that's a bit too abstract.

Wait, another approach: since ω^k are all the roots of x¹³ - 1, then the product over (x - ω^k) is x¹³ - 1. But here, I have a product of f(ω^k), which is a product of (ω^{2k} - 2ω^k + 2). Maybe I can relate this to evaluating another polynomial at x=2 or something.

Alternatively, perhaps I can think of f(x) = x² - 2x + 2, and then the product over f(ω^k) is equal to the product of (ω^{2k} - 2ω^k + 2). Let me see if I can write this as another polynomial evaluated at some point.

Wait, another idea: consider that for each ω^k, f(ω^k) = (ω^k)^2 - 2ω^k + 2. So, if I consider the product over all k, it's the product over all 13th roots of (x² - 2x + 2) evaluated at x=ω^k. So maybe this product is equal to the resultant of x^13 - 1 and x² - 2x + 2. 

Alternatively, perhaps I can consider that the product over (x^2 - 2x + 2) as x runs over the roots of x^13 - 1 = 0. So maybe that's the same as evaluating some resultant or using the fact that the product is equal to the resultant of x^13 - 1 and x² - 2x + 2. 

But I'm not exactly sure about that. Maybe a more straightforward approach: since ω is a primitive 13th root, then the minimal polynomial is Φ₁₃(x) = x¹² + x¹¹ + ... + x + 1, as I thought earlier.

Wait, so perhaps I can express the product as f(1) times the product over the other roots. Wait, f(1) is 1² - 2*1 + 2 = 1 -2 +2=1. So f(1)=1. So the product becomes the product over k=1 to 12 of (ω^{2k} - 2ω^k + 2). So that's the same as product over ω^k where ω^k are the primitive 13th roots.

Hmm, so maybe I can think of the product as product_{k=1}^{12} (ω^{2k} - 2ω^k + 2). 

Alternatively, perhaps I can write this as product_{k=1}^{12} ( (ω^k)^2 - 2ω^k + 2 ). So, if I let y = ω^k, then each term is y² - 2y + 2. So, for each primitive 13th root y, compute y² - 2y + 2, and take the product.

Wait, but since y runs over all primitive 13th roots, which are the roots of Φ₁₃(x) = x¹² + x¹¹ + ... + x + 1. So, perhaps the product over y of (y² - 2y + 2) is equal to the resultant of Φ₁₃(x) and the polynomial x² - 2x + 2.

But I'm not sure about that. Maybe another approach: the product over (y² - 2y + 2) for y being all primitive 13th roots is equal to the product over (y - a)(y - b), where a and b are the roots of x² - 2x + 2 = 0. 

Wait, since x² - 2x + 2 = 0 has roots (2 ± sqrt(4 - 8))/2 = (2 ± sqrt(-4))/2 = 1 ± i. So, a=1+i and b=1-i. So, then the product over (y - a)(y - b) for y in the primitive 13th roots is equal to the product over (y - a) times the product over (y - b). 

Which would be equal to Φ₁₃(a) * Φ₁₃(b), since for each root y of Φ₁₃(x), (y - a) is a factor, so the product over (y - a) is Φ₁₃(a), and similarly for (y - b).

Ah, that seems promising. So, the product over all primitive 13th roots y of (y² - 2y + 2) is equal to Φ₁₃(a) * Φ₁₃(b), where a=1+i and b=1-i.

So, then the product I'm looking for is f(1) times Φ₁₃(a) * Φ₁₃(b). Since f(1)=1, the total product is Φ₁₃(a) * Φ₁₃(b).

Now, Φ₁₃(x) is x¹² + x¹¹ + ... + x + 1. So, Φ₁₃(x) = (x¹³ - 1)/(x - 1) when x ≠ 1.

So, Φ₁₃(a) = (a¹³ - 1)/(a - 1). Similarly, Φ₁₃(b) = (b¹³ - 1)/(b - 1).

So, perhaps I can compute a¹³ and b¹³. Since a=1+i, which is sqrt(2) e^{iπ/4}, so a^k would be (sqrt(2))^k e^{i k π/4}.

Wait, but 13 is the exponent. So, a¹³ = (sqrt(2))^{13} e^{i 13 π/4}.

Similarly, sqrt(2)^13 is 2^(13/2) = 2^6 * 2^(1/2) = 64 * sqrt(2). 

As for e^{i 13 π/4}, 13 π/4 is equal to 3π + π/4, which is the same as π/4 in the next rotation, because angles are periodic modulo 2π. So 13π/4 = 3π + π/4 = π + π/4 + 2π = π + π/4. Wait, maybe better to compute 13 mod 8, since 2π is a full circle. 13 divided by 8 is 1 with remainder 5. So 13π/4 = (8 + 5)π/4 = 2π + 5π/4. So, e^{i 13π/4} = e^{i 5π/4} = cos(5π/4) + i sin(5π/4) = (-sqrt(2)/2) - i sqrt(2)/2.

So, a¹³ = 64 sqrt(2) * [ (-sqrt(2)/2) - i sqrt(2)/2 ].

Let me compute that: 64 sqrt(2) * (-sqrt(2)/2) = 64 * (2)/2 * (-1) = 64 * (-1) = -64.

Similarly, 64 sqrt(2) * (-i sqrt(2)/2) = 64 * (2)/2 * (-i) = 64*(-i) = -64i.

So, a¹³ = -64 - 64i. 

Similarly, b = 1 - i, which is sqrt(2) e^{-iπ/4}, so b¹³ = (sqrt(2))^{13} e^{-i 13π/4}. 

Again, sqrt(2)^13 is 64 sqrt(2). e^{-i13π/4} is e^{-i(5π/4)} because 13π/4 mod 2π is 5π/4 as before, but negative. So e^{-i5π/4} = cos(-5π/4) + i sin(-5π/4) = cos(5π/4) - i sin(5π/4) = (-sqrt(2)/2) + i sqrt(2)/2.

So, b¹³ = 64 sqrt(2) * [ (-sqrt(2)/2) + i sqrt(2)/2 ].

Calculating this: 64 sqrt(2) * (-sqrt(2)/2) = 64*(-1) = -64.

64 sqrt(2) * (i sqrt(2)/2) = 64 i.

So, b¹³ = -64 + 64i.

Now, let's compute Φ₁₃(a) = (a¹³ - 1)/(a - 1). We have a¹³ = -64 -64i, so a¹³ - 1 = (-64 -64i) - 1 = -65 -64i.

a = 1 + i, so a -1 = i.

So, Φ₁₃(a) = (-65 -64i)/i. Let's compute this: multiply numerator and denominator by -i to rationalize.

(-65 -64i) * (-i) / (i * -i) = (65i + 64i²) / 1, since i*(-i)=1.

But i² = -1, so 64i² = -64. So, numerator becomes 65i -64.

Thus, Φ₁₃(a) = 65i -64.

Similarly, compute Φ₁₃(b) = (b¹³ - 1)/(b - 1).

b¹³ = -64 +64i, so b¹³ - 1 = (-64 +64i) -1 = -65 +64i.

b = 1 - i, so b -1 = -i.

Thus, Φ₁₃(b) = (-65 +64i)/(-i).

Multiply numerator and denominator by i:

(-65 +64i)*i / (-i * i) = (-65i +64i²)/1.

i² = -1, so 64i² = -64. So numerator becomes -65i -64.

Thus, Φ₁₃(b) = (-65i -64).

So, now the product Φ₁₃(a) * Φ₁₃(b) = (65i -64) * (-65i -64).

Let me compute this:

= (65i)(-65i) + (65i)(-64) + (-64)(-65i) + (-64)(-64)

= (-4225 i²) + (-4160i) + (4160i) + 4096.

Simplify each term:

-4225 i² = -4225*(-1) = 4225.

-4160i + 4160i = 0.

4096 remains.

So total is 4225 + 4096 = 8321.

Wait, that can't be right because 4225 + 4096 is 8321, but let me check the calculation again.

Wait, let me recast the multiplication:

(65i -64)(-65i -64) = (-65i)(65i) + (-65i)(-64) + (-64)(65i) + (-64)(-64)

Wait, no, that's not correct. It's better to do it as (a + b)(c + d) = ac + ad + bc + bd.

Wait, more accurately: 

(65i -64)(-65i -64) = (65i)*(-65i) + (65i)*(-64) + (-64)*(-65i) + (-64)*(-64).

Compute each term:

65i * -65i = - (65)^2 i² = -4225*(-1) = 4225.

65i * (-64) = -64*65 i = -4160 i.

-64 * (-65i) = 4160 i.

-64 * (-64) = 4096.

So, now adding all these terms:

4225 -4160i + 4160i + 4096.

The -4160i and +4160i cancel each other out, leaving 4225 + 4096.

4225 + 4096: let's compute that.

4225 + 4000 = 8225.

8225 + 96 = 8321.

So, the product Φ₁₃(a)*Φ₁₃(b) is 8321.

Wait, but earlier I thought the product over (y² - 2y +2) for all primitive 13th roots y is equal to Φ₁₃(a)*Φ₁₃(b), which is 8321. But wait, wait: in the problem statement, the product is from k=0 to 12, which includes k=0. When k=0, ω^0=1, so the term is 2 -2*1 +1^2 = 2 -2 +1=1. So, the total product is Φ₁₃(a)*Φ₁₃(b) *1 = 8321.

Wait, but earlier steps: the product over k=0 to 12 is f(ω^k) where f(x)=x² -2x +2. So, that product is ∏_{k=0}^{12} (ω^{2k} - 2ω^k +2). Which, as we considered, is equal to Φ₁₃(a) * Φ₁₃(b), which is 8321.

So, the problem asks for the remainder when this product is divided by 1000. So, 8321 divided by 1000 leaves a remainder of 321.

Wait, let me check my steps again to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. 

First, I wrote f(x) = x² -2x +2.

Then, for each 13th root of unity ω^k, I computed f(ω^k) and took the product.

I realized that the product over all ω^k of f(ω^k) is equal to Φ₁₃(a)*Φ₁₃(b), where a and b are roots of f(x)=0.

Then, I computed Φ₁₃(a) and Φ₁₃(b) by evaluating Φ₁₃(x) at x=a and x=b, which are 1+i and 1-i.

Then, Φ₁₃(x) = (x¹³ -1)/(x-1). So, I calculated a^13 and b^13, which were -64 -64i and -64 +64i respectively.

Then, Φ₁₃(a) = (a^13 -1)/(a -1) = (-65 -64i)/i = 65i -64, and similarly Φ₁₃(b) = (-65 +64i)/(-i) = -65i -64.

Then, I multiplied these two to get 8321. 

Wait, but let me confirm the multiplication:

(65i -64)(-65i -64).

Let me do it again:

Multiply 65i by each term in the second bracket: 65i*(-65i) = - (65)^2 i² = -4225*(-1)=4225, and 65i*(-64) = -4160i.

Then, multiply -64 by each term: -64*(-65i) = +4160i, and -64*(-64) = +4096.

So, adding all together: 4225 -4160i +4160i +4096 = 4225 +4096 = 8321.

Yes, that seems correct.

So, the product is 8321. Then, 8321 mod 1000 is the last three digits, which is 321.

Wait, because 1000*8=8000, so 8321-8000=321.

So, the remainder is 321.

Wait, but I should make sure I didn't make any mistake in the earlier steps.

Wait, another way to compute the product could be to note that the product is equal to the absolute value squared of Φ₁₃(a), since a and b are complex conjugates, and Φ₁₃(a) and Φ₁₃(b) are also conjugates. So, their product is |Φ₁₃(a)|².

Wait, but in our case, Φ₁₃(a) was 65i -64, which is a complex number. Its conjugate would be -65i -64, which is Φ₁₃(b). So, their product is |Φ₁₃(a)|².

So, |65i -64|² = (65)^2 + (64)^2 = 4225 + 4096 = 8321.

Yes, that's correct. So, that approach also gives 8321, same as before.

So, I think the answer is 321. Therefore, the remainder when the product is divided by 1000 is 321.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To solve the problem, we need to find the remainder when the product \( \prod_{k=0}^{12}(2 - 2\omega^k + \omega^{2k}) \) is divided by 1000, where \( \omega \) is a primitive 13th root of unity.

1. **Express the term as a quadratic**: Each term in the product can be written as \( f(\omega^k) \) where \( f(x) = x^2 - 2x + 2 \).

2. **Roots of the quadratic**: The roots of \( f(x) = 0 \) are \( a = 1 + i \) and \( b = 1 - i \).

3. **Cyclotomic polynomial**: The product over all 13th roots of unity of \( f(\omega^k) \) can be expressed using the cyclotomic polynomial \( \Phi_{13}(x) \), which is \( x^{12} + x^{11} + \dots + x + 1 \).

4. **Evaluate at \( a \) and \( b \)**: The product \( \prod_{k=0}^{12} f(\omega^k) \) is equal to \( \Phi_{13}(a) \cdot \Phi_{13}(b) \).

5. **Compute \( \Phi_{13}(a) \) and \( \Phi_{13}(b) \)**:
   - \( a = 1 + i \) and \( b = 1 - i \).
   - Using \( \Phi_{13}(x) = \frac{x^{13} - 1}{x - 1} \), compute \( a^{13} \) and \( b^{13} \).
   - \( a^{13} = -64 - 64i \) and \( b^{13} = -64 + 64i \).
   - \( \Phi_{13}(a) = \frac{-65 - 64i}{i} = 65i - 64 \).
   - \( \Phi_{13}(b) = \frac{-65 + 64i}{-i} = -65i - 64 \).

6. **Multiply results**: The product \( \Phi_{13}(a) \cdot \Phi_{13}(b) = (65i - 64)(-65i - 64) = 8321 \).

7. **Find the remainder**: The remainder when 8321 is divided by 1000 is 321.

Thus, the remainder is \(\boxed{321}\).
