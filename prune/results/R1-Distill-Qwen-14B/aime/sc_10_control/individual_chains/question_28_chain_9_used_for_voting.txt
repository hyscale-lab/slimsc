Okay, so I've got this problem about a tetrahedron ABCD. Let me try to visualize it first. A tetrahedron has four triangular faces, right? The problem states some specific edge lengths: AB and CD are both sqrt(41), AC and BD are sqrt(80), and BC and AD are sqrt(89). Interesting, so each pair of opposite edges are equal. That seems symmetrical in some way.

The question is about finding the distance from a special point I inside the tetrahedron to each of its faces. This point is called the incenter, similar to the incenter of a triangle. In a tetrahedron, the incenter is equidistant from all four faces, and that distance is what we're trying to find.

I remember that in a triangle, the inradius can be found using the formula r = A/s, where A is the area and s is the semi-perimeter. But in a tetrahedron, it's a bit more complicated. I think the formula involves the volume and the surface area. Maybe something like r = 3V/S, where V is the volume and S is the total surface area. Let me check if that makes sense.

Yes, in a tetrahedron, the formula for the inradius is indeed 3 times the volume divided by the total surface area. So, first, I need to find the volume of this tetrahedron, and then calculate the surface area.

But wait, calculating the volume of an arbitrary tetrahedron can be tricky. However, since the opposite edges are equal, maybe the tetrahedron is "equifacial" or something. Alternatively, maybe it's a kind of isosceles tetrahedron, which allows for some symmetry to be exploited.

I think such a tetrahedron is called a "disphenoid." Yes, a disphenoid is a tetrahedron where each pair of opposite edges are equal. So, in this case, ABCD is a disphenoid. That should help because there are some known properties about disphenoids that might make calculating the volume easier.

I recall that in a disphenoid, the volume can be calculated if we know the lengths of the edges. There might be a specific formula for that. Let me try to recall or derive it.

Alternatively, maybe I can place the tetrahedron in a coordinate system to simplify calculations. Let me try that approach.

Since the opposite edges are equal, perhaps I can assign coordinates to the vertices such that the centroid is at the origin or something. But maybe it's better to place the points in such a way that the calculations are symmetric.

Let me think: suppose I set point A at (x, y, z), point B at (-x, -y, z), point C at (-x, y, -z), and point D at (x, -y, -z). This setup might make the opposite edges equal because of the symmetry.

Wait, let me check that. The distance between A and B would be sqrt[(2x)^2 + (2y)^2 + 0^2] = sqrt(4x² + 4y²) = 2*sqrt(x² + y²). Similarly, the distance between C and D would be the same because of their coordinates. So, AB = CD as desired. Similarly, let's compute AC.

Point A is (x,y,z) and point C is (-x,y,-z). The distance AC is sqrt[(2x)^2 + 0^2 + (2z)^2] = sqrt(4x² + 4z²) = 2*sqrt(x² + z²). Similarly, BD would be between B (-x,-y,z) and D (x,-y,-z): sqrt[(2x)^2 + 0^2 + (2z)^2] = same as AC. So AC = BD, which matches the problem statement.

Similarly, BC is between (-x,-y,z) and (-x,y,-z). The distance is sqrt[0 + (2y)^2 + (2z)^2] = 2*sqrt(y² + z²). Similarly, AD is between (x,y,z) and (x,-y,-z): sqrt[0 + (2y)^2 + (2z)^2] = same as BC. So BC = AD, which also matches.

Great, so with this coordinate system, the tetrahedron is symmetric, and we have AB = CD, AC = BD, BC = AD. So, now, given the edge lengths, we can set up equations to find x, y, z.

So, given AB = sqrt(41). From earlier, AB = 2*sqrt(x² + y²) = sqrt(41). So, 2*sqrt(x² + y²) = sqrt(41) => sqrt(x² + y²) = sqrt(41)/2 => x² + y² = 41/4.

Similarly, AC = sqrt(80). AC = 2*sqrt(x² + z²) = sqrt(80) => sqrt(x² + z²) = sqrt(80)/2 => x² + z² = 80/4 = 20.

Similarly, BC = sqrt(89). BC = 2*sqrt(y² + z²) = sqrt(89) => sqrt(y² + z²) = sqrt(89)/2 => y² + z² = 89/4.

So now we have three equations:

1. x² + y² = 41/4
2. x² + z² = 20
3. y² + z² = 89/4

We can solve these equations for x², y², z².

Let me write them down:

Equation 1: x² + y² = 41/4

Equation 2: x² + z² = 20

Equation 3: y² + z² = 89/4

Let's subtract Equation 1 from Equation 2:

(x² + z²) - (x² + y²) = 20 - 41/4

z² - y² = (80/4 - 41/4) = 39/4

So, z² - y² = 39/4.

But from Equation 3: y² + z² = 89/4.

Let me write:

Equation 4: z² - y² = 39/4

Equation 3: z² + y² = 89/4

Now, adding Equations 3 and 4:

2 z² = (39/4 + 89/4) = 128/4 = 32

So, z² = 16 => z = 4 or z = -4. Since we're dealing with lengths, the sign doesn't matter, so z = 4.

Subtracting Equations 4 from Equation 3:

2 y² = (89/4 - 39/4) = 50/4 = 25/2

So, y² = 25/4 => y = 5/2 or y = -5/2, so y = 5/2.

Then, from Equation 1: x² + y² = 41/4 => x² + 25/4 = 41/4 => x² = 16/4 = 4 => x = 2 or x = -2, so x = 2.

So, now we have x = 2, y = 5/2, z =4.

So, the coordinates are:

A = (2, 5/2, 4)

B = (-2, -5/2, 4)

C = (-2, 5/2, -4)

D = (2, -5/2, -4)

Wait, let me confirm:

Wait, in my initial setup, point A was (x,y,z), B was (-x,-y,z), C was (-x,y,-z), D was (x,-y,-z). So, with x = 2, y = 5/2, z =4, so:

A = (2, 5/2, 4)

B = (-2, -5/2, 4)

C = (-2, 5/2, -4)

D = (2, -5/2, -4)

Yes, that looks right.

Now, to find the volume of the tetrahedron. One way to calculate the volume is to use the scalar triple product formula. The formula is (1/6)*| (AB · (AC × AD)) |.

Wait, let me pick vectors AB, AC, AD from point A.

First, let's compute vectors AB, AC, AD.

Point A is (2,5/2,4)

Point B is (-2,-5/2,4), so vector AB = B - A = (-2-2, -5/2 -5/2,4-4) = (-4, -5, 0)

Point C is (-2,5/2,-4), so vector AC = C - A = (-2-2,5/2 -5/2, -4-4) = (-4, 0, -8)

Point D is (2,-5/2,-4), so vector AD = D - A = (2-2, -5/2 -5/2, -4 -4) = (0, -5, -8)

So vectors:

AB = (-4, -5, 0)

AC = (-4, 0, -8)

AD = (0, -5, -8)

Now, the scalar triple product AB · (AC × AD) is the determinant of the matrix formed by these vectors as columns (or rows).

Let me compute the cross product AC × AD first.

AC × AD = |i   j   k|
             -4   0  -8
              0  -5  -8

= i*(0*(-8) - (-8)*(-5)) - j*(-4*(-8) - (-8)*0) + k*(-4*(-5) - 0*0)

Compute each component:

i-component: 0*(-8) - (-8)*(-5) = 0 - 40 = -40

j-component: - [(-4)*(-8) - (-8)*0] = - [32 - 0] = -32

k-component: (-4)*(-5) - 0*0 = 20 - 0 = 20

So, AC × AD = (-40, -32, 20)

Now, take the dot product with AB = (-4, -5, 0):

AB · (AC × AD) = (-4)*(-40) + (-5)*(-32) + 0*20 = 160 + 160 + 0 = 320

So, the scalar triple product is 320.

Thus, the volume V = (1/6)*|320| = 320/6 = 160/3.

Wait, that seems a bit large, but let me check the calculations again.

Wait, cross product:

AC × AD:

i: (0*(-8) - (-8)*(-5)) = 0 - 40 = -40

j: - [ (-4)*(-8) - (-8)*0 ] = - [32 - 0] = -32

k: (-4*(-5) - 0*0 ) = 20 - 0 = 20

So, yes, that's correct.

Dot product with AB: (-4, -5, 0) · (-40, -32, 20) = ( (-4)*(-40) ) + ( (-5)*(-32) ) + 0 = 160 + 160 = 320. Correct.

So, V = 320 / 6 = 160/3. So, volume is 160/3.

Okay, now I need the total surface area S of the tetrahedron. Since all faces are triangles, and each pair of opposite edges are equal, the faces might all be congruent or something. Wait, but not necessarily.

Wait, the edges are AB=CD=sqrt(41), AC=BD=sqrt(80), BC=AD=sqrt(89). So, each face is a triangle with sides sqrt(41), sqrt(80), sqrt(89). Wait, is that true?

Wait, each face is a triangle. Let me see.

Take face ABC: it has edges AB, BC, and AC. AB is sqrt(41), BC is sqrt(89), AC is sqrt(80). So yes, each face has sides sqrt(41), sqrt(80), sqrt(89). So all four faces are congruent triangles. That makes things easier.

So, if each face is a triangle with sides sqrt(41), sqrt(80), sqrt(89), then the area of each face is the same, so the total surface area S is 4 times the area of one face.

So, I just need to compute the area of one face and multiply by 4.

Let me compute the area of triangle ABC with sides a = sqrt(41), b = sqrt(89), c = sqrt(80).

I can use Heron's formula here. Heron's formula says that the area is sqrt[s(s-a)(s-b)(s-c)], where s is the semi-perimeter.

So, s = (sqrt(41) + sqrt(89) + sqrt(80)) / 2.

Hmm, computing this might get messy. Maybe there's a better way, perhaps using vectors or coordinates.

Alternatively, since I know the coordinates of points A, B, and C, I can compute the area using the cross product.

Point A is (2, 5/2, 4), point B is (-2, -5/2, 4), point C is (-2,5/2,-4).

Wait, but in 3D, the area of triangle ABC is (1/2)*|AB × AC|.

Wait, AB is (-4, -5, 0), AC is (-4, 0, -8). So, cross product AB × AC.

AB × AC = |i   j   k|
             -4   -5    0
             -4    0   -8

i-component: (-5*(-8) - 0*0) = 40 - 0 = 40

j-component: - [ (-4*(-8) - 0*(-4) ) ] = - [32 - 0 ] = -32

k-component: (-4*0 - (-5)*(-4)) = 0 - 20 = -20

So, AB × AC = (40, -32, -20)

The magnitude of this vector is sqrt(40² + (-32)^2 + (-20)^2) = sqrt(1600 + 1024 + 400) = sqrt(3024).

Simplify sqrt(3024). Let's factor 3024:

3024 ÷ 16 = 189 → 16 * 189.

189 = 9*21 = 9*3*7. So, 3024 = 16 * 9 * 3 * 7 = 16 * 9 * 21.

sqrt(3024) = sqrt(16 * 9 * 21) = 4 * 3 * sqrt(21) = 12 sqrt(21).

So, |AB × AC| = 12 sqrt(21), so the area of triangle ABC is (1/2)*12 sqrt(21) = 6 sqrt(21).

Therefore, each face has area 6 sqrt(21), so total surface area S = 4 * 6 sqrt(21) = 24 sqrt(21).

Wait a second, let me double-check that cross product calculation.

AB × AC:

i: (-5)*(-8) - 0*0 = 40 - 0 = 40

j: - [ (-4)*(-8) - 0*(-4) ) ] = - [32 - 0] = -32

k: (-4)*0 - (-5)*(-4) = 0 - 20 = -20

Yes, that's correct. So, the cross product is (40, -32, -20). Its magnitude is sqrt(40^2 + (-32)^2 + (-20)^2) = sqrt(1600 + 1024 + 400) = sqrt(3024). 3024 is 16*189, and 189 is 9*21, so sqrt(3024) = 4*3*sqrt(21) = 12 sqrt(21). So, the area is (1/2)*12 sqrt(21) = 6 sqrt(21). Correct.

So, the total surface area S = 4 * 6 sqrt(21) = 24 sqrt(21).

Now, the inradius r is 3V/S.

We have V = 160/3, S = 24 sqrt(21).

So, r = 3*(160/3) / (24 sqrt(21)) ) = (160) / (24 sqrt(21)).

Simplify this fraction.

160 / 24 = (160 ÷ 8)/(24 ÷ 8) = 20/3.

So, r = (20/3) / sqrt(21) = 20/(3 sqrt(21)).

We can rationalize the denominator: 20 sqrt(21) / (3 * 21) ) = 20 sqrt(21) / 63.

So, r = (20 sqrt(21))/63.

But let me check the calculation again.

r = 3V/S, which is 3*(160/3) / (24 sqrt(21)).

3*(160/3) is 160. So, 160 / (24 sqrt(21)) = (160 ÷ 8)/(24 ÷ 8) sqrt(21) ) = 20/(3 sqrt(21)).

Yes, that's correct. Then, rationalizing:

20/(3 sqrt(21)) * (sqrt(21)/sqrt(21)) = 20 sqrt(21) / (3 * 21) = 20 sqrt(21)/63.

So, the distance is 20 sqrt(21)/63.

But let me check if 20 and 63 have any common factors. 20 factors are 2,2,5. 63 is 7,3,3. So, no common factors. So, the fraction is in simplest terms.

Also, sqrt(21) is already simplified because 21 is 3*7, neither of which is a square.

So, the distance is 20 sqrt(21)/63, which is written as (20√21)/63.

So, m =20, n=21, p=63.

Wait, but wait, 20 and 63: gcd(20,63) is 1, so they are coprime. n=21 is square-free, since 21=3*7, which are primes. So, yes, the form is correct.

So, m + n + p = 20 + 21 + 63 = 104.

Wait, but let me check all steps again to make sure I didn't make any miscalculations.

Wait, in the cross product AB × AC, I think I computed it correctly. Let me recheck:

AB is (-4, -5, 0), AC is (-4, 0, -8).

So, cross product:

i ( (-5)(-8) - 0*0 ) = i*40

-j ( (-4)(-8) - 0*(-4) ) = -j*(32 - 0)= -32j

+k ( (-4)(0) - (-5)(-4) ) = k*(0 -20)= -20k

So, (40, -32, -20), which is correct.

Magnitude squared: 40² + (-32)^2 + (-20)^2 = 1600 +1024 +400= 3024. Yes.

3024 is 16 * 189, 189 is 9*21, so sqrt(3024)=12 sqrt(21). So, area of triangle is 6 sqrt(21). Correct.

Total surface area 4 * 6 sqrt(21) = 24 sqrt(21). Correct.

Volume is 160/3. So, inradius r = (3V)/S = (160)/(24 sqrt(21)) = (20)/(3 sqrt(21)) = (20 sqrt(21))/63. Correct.

So, all steps seem okay. Therefore, the answer is 20 +21 +63 = 104.

**Final Answer**
\boxed{104}


--- Final Answer Content ---


Given a tetrahedron \(ABCD\) with equal opposite edges: \(AB = CD = \sqrt{41}\), \(AC = BD = \sqrt{80}\), and \(BC = AD = \sqrt{89}\). We need to find the distance from the incenter \(I\) to each face, which is the inradius.

First, we recognize that the tetrahedron is a disphenoid, meaning it has symmetry which allows us to place the vertices in a coordinate system. We assign coordinates to the vertices as follows:
- \(A = (2, \frac{5}{2}, 4)\)
- \(B = (-2, -\frac{5}{2}, 4)\)
- \(C = (-2, \frac{5}{2}, -4)\)
- \(D = (2, -\frac{5}{2}, -4)\)

We calculate the volume \(V\) using the scalar triple product of vectors from point \(A\):
- Vectors: \(\overrightarrow{AB} = (-4, -5, 0)\), \(\overrightarrow{AC} = (-4, 0, -8)\), \(\overrightarrow{AD} = (0, -5, -8)\)
- Cross product \(\overrightarrow{AC} \times \overrightarrow{AD} = (-40, -32, 20)\)
- Dot product \(\overrightarrow{AB} \cdot (\overrightarrow{AC} \times \overrightarrow{AD}) = 320\)
- Volume \(V = \frac{1}{6} |320| = \frac{160}{3}\)

Next, we calculate the total surface area \(S\). Each face is a triangle with sides \(\sqrt{41}\), \(\sqrt{80}\), and \(\sqrt{89}\). Using the cross product to find the area of one face:
- Cross product \(\overrightarrow{AB} \times \overrightarrow{AC} = (40, -32, -20)\)
- Magnitude of cross product: \(\sqrt{40^2 + (-32)^2 + (-20)^2} = 12\sqrt{21}\)
- Area of one face: \(\frac{1}{2} \times 12\sqrt{21} = 6\sqrt{21}\)
- Total surface area \(S = 4 \times 6\sqrt{21} = 24\sqrt{21}\)

The inradius \(r\) is given by \(r = \frac{3V}{S}\):
- \(r = \frac{3 \times \frac{160}{3}}{24\sqrt{21}} = \frac{160}{24\sqrt{21}} = \frac{20\sqrt{21}}{63}\)

The distance is in the form \(\frac{20\sqrt{21}}{63}\), where \(m = 20\), \(n = 21\), and \(p = 63\). Thus, \(m + n + p = 20 + 21 + 63 = 104\).

\[
\boxed{104}
