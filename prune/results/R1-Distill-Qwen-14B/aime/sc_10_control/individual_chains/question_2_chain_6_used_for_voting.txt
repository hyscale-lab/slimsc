Okay, so I've got this geometry problem here. Let me try to understand it step by step. 

We have points O, A, and B with coordinates O(0,0), A(1/2, 0), and B(0, sqrt(3)/2). So O is the origin, A is on the x-axis at (1/2, 0), and B is on the y-axis at (0, sqrt(3)/2). That makes triangle OAB with vertices at those points.

The family F consists of segments PQ of unit length. Each PQ is a segment of length 1, lying in the first quadrant. P is on the x-axis, and Q is on the y-axis. So for each PQ in F, P is some point (p, 0) and Q is some point (0, q), with p and q positive real numbers, such that the distance between P and Q is 1. 

So, the distance between P and Q is sqrt((p)^2 + (q)^2) = 1. Therefore, p^2 + q^2 = 1. That means each PQ is a line segment from (p, 0) to (0, q), where p and q satisfy p^2 + q^2 = 1. So, this is a family of line segments that are all of unit length, starting on the x-axis and ending on the y-axis in the first quadrant.

The problem states that there's a unique point C on segment AB, different from A and B, that doesn't lie on any segment from F except for AB itself. So, C is on AB, and for any other segment PQ in F, C isn't on PQ. We need to find OC^2, where O is the origin, and express it as a fraction p/q with p and q coprime, then find p + q.

Alright, so first, I think I need to find the equation of line AB. Then, parametrize point C on AB, and then find conditions such that C does not lie on any other PQ in F except AB.

Let me find the equation of AB. Points A(1/2, 0) and B(0, sqrt(3)/2). The slope of AB is (sqrt(3)/2 - 0)/(0 - 1/2) = (sqrt(3)/2)/(-1/2) = -sqrt(3). 

So, the equation of AB is y = -sqrt(3)(x - 1/2). Let me check that. When x = 1/2, y = 0, which matches point A. When x = 0, y = -sqrt(3)*(-1/2) = sqrt(3)/2, which matches point B. Yes, that's correct.

So, any point C on AB can be written as (x, y) = (x, -sqrt(3)(x - 1/2)). Alternatively, parametrizing AB, we can write it as t*(1/2, 0) + (1 - t)*(0, sqrt(3)/2) for t between 0 and 1. That would give points C(t) = (t*(1/2), (1 - t)*(sqrt(3)/2)).

So, coordinates of C are (t/2, sqrt(3)/2*(1 - t)), where t is between 0 and 1.

Now, for each segment PQ in F, which is from (p, 0) to (0, q) with p^2 + q^2 = 1, we can write the equation of PQ. Let me recall that the equation of a line passing through (p, 0) and (0, q) is (x/p) + (y/q) = 1.

So, the equation is x/p + y/q = 1. Since p^2 + q^2 = 1, we can maybe express q in terms of p or vice versa.

Our point C(t) must not lie on any such PQ except when PQ is AB itself. Wait, but AB is a specific PQ in F? Let me check: AB is from A(1/2, 0) to B(0, sqrt(3)/2). So p = 1/2, q = sqrt(3)/2. Then, p^2 + q^2 = (1/4) + (3/4) = 1, so yes, AB is indeed in F. So, for other segments PQ in F, C(t) must not lie on PQ.

So, for C(t) to not lie on any PQ except AB, the equation x/p + y/q = 1 should not hold for any other p and q such that p^2 + q^2 = 1, except when p = 1/2 and q = sqrt(3)/2.

So, for point C(t) = (t/2, sqrt(3)/2*(1 - t)), plugging into the PQ equation:

(t/2)/p + (sqrt(3)/2*(1 - t))/q = 1.

We want this equation to hold only when p = 1/2 and q = sqrt(3)/2.

So, for other p and q, this should not hold. So, we need to find t such that the above equation is only satisfied for the specific p and q of AB.

Alternatively, to find t such that the system:

x/p + y/q = 1,

with x = t/2, y = sqrt(3)/2*(1 - t),

and p^2 + q^2 = 1,

has only one solution (p, q) = (1/2, sqrt(3)/2).

So, when we substitute x and y into the first equation, we get:

(t/2)/p + (sqrt(3)/2*(1 - t))/q = 1.

Let me denote this as equation (1):

(t/(2p)) + (sqrt(3)(1 - t)/(2q)) = 1.

We also have the condition p^2 + q^2 = 1, which is equation (2).

We can think of equation (1) as a linear equation in p and q, and equation (2) as a quadratic. So, the system has a solution (p, q). For the system to have only one solution, the equations must be dependent in a certain way.

Wait, but we have two equations and two variables (p and q). So, the system could have zero, one, or infinitely many solutions. But since we know that p = 1/2 and q = sqrt(3)/2 is a solution, if the system has another solution, then point C lies on another PQ in F.

So, to have only one solution, the equations should have exactly one solution, i.e., the system should be such that the line (1) is tangent to the unit circle (2).

Wait, yes, that makes sense. So, equation (1) is a line in the (p, q) plane, and equation (2) is the unit circle. For the system to have exactly one solution, the line must be tangent to the circle.

Therefore, the condition is that the line (t/(2p)) + (sqrt(3)(1 - t)/(2q)) = 1 is tangent to the unit circle p^2 + q^2 = 1.

So, to find t such that this line is tangent to the unit circle. 

The condition for a line a p + b q = c to be tangent to the unit circle is that the distance from the center (0,0) to the line is equal to 1. The formula for the distance is |c| / sqrt(a^2 + b^2). So, we have:

|c| / sqrt(a^2 + b^2) = 1.

In our case, the line equation is:

(t/(2p)) + (sqrt(3)(1 - t)/(2q)) = 1.

Let me write it as:

(t/(2)) * (1/p) + (sqrt(3)(1 - t)/2) * (1/q) = 1.

So, in the standard form a p + b q = c, a = t/(2), b = sqrt(3)(1 - t)/2, and c = 1.

So, the distance from (0,0) to this line is |c| / sqrt(a^2 + b^2) = 1.

So, 1 / sqrt( (t/2)^2 + (sqrt(3)(1 - t)/2)^2 ) = 1.

Therefore, sqrt( (t^2)/4 + (3(1 - t)^2)/4 ) = 1.

Simplify inside the square root:

( t^2 + 3(1 - 2t + t^2) ) / 4 = 1^2.

Multiply both sides by 4:

t^2 + 3(1 - 2t + t^2) = 4.

Expand the terms:

t^2 + 3 - 6t + 3t^2 = 4.

Combine like terms:

(1 + 3) t^2 -6t + 3 = 4.

So, 4t^2 -6t +3 =4.

Subtract 4:

4t^2 -6t -1 =0.

So, quadratic equation 4t^2 -6t -1=0.

Let me solve for t.

Using quadratic formula: t = [6 ± sqrt(36 + 16)] / 8.

Compute sqrt(36 +16)=sqrt(52)=2*sqrt(13).

So, t = [6 ± 2sqrt(13)] /8 = [3 ± sqrt(13)] /4.

Now, we need to find t between 0 and 1, since point C is on AB from A( t=0 ) to B( t=1 ). So, let's compute the two roots:

t1 = [3 + sqrt(13)] /4 ≈ (3 + 3.6055)/4 ≈ 6.6055/4 ≈1.651. That's greater than 1, so it's outside the interval [0,1].

t2 = [3 - sqrt(13)] /4 ≈ (3 -3.6055)/4 ≈ (-0.6055)/4 ≈ -0.1514. That's negative, also outside the interval [0,1].

Wait, that's a problem. Did I do the algebra correctly?

Wait, let's re-examine the steps.

We had:

Equation (1): (t/(2p)) + (sqrt(3)(1 - t)/(2q)) =1.

Equation (2): p^2 + q^2 =1.

We rearranged equation (1) as (t/(2)) * (1/p) + (sqrt(3)(1 - t)/2) * (1/q) =1.

Then, the standard form is a p + b q = c, but actually, wait a second, is that correct?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in treating the equation. Let me write equation (1) again:

(t/(2p)) + (sqrt(3)(1 - t)/(2q)) =1.

Multiplying both sides by 2p q to eliminate denominators:

t q + sqrt(3)(1 - t) p = 2 p q.

But that seems more complicated. Alternatively, perhaps it's better to use the condition for tangency correctly.

Wait, perhaps an alternative approach.

The line equation is (x/p) + (y/q) =1, and we are substituting x = t/2 and y = sqrt(3)/2 (1 - t). So, equation (1) becomes:

(t/(2p)) + (sqrt(3)(1 - t)/(2q)) =1.

Let me denote this as (t)/(2p) + (sqrt(3)(1 - t))/(2q) =1.

Let me denote that as (t)/(2p) + (sqrt(3)(1 - t))/(2q) =1.

Let me write this as:

(t q + sqrt(3)(1 - t) p ) / (2 p q) ) =1.

Wait, but that's just rearrangement. Alternatively, let me think of it as:

(t q + sqrt(3)(1 - t) p ) = 2 p q.

Hmm, perhaps not helpful.

Alternatively, perhaps I can write equation (1) as:

t/(2p) + (sqrt(3)(1 - t))/(2 q) =1.

Let me write this as:

t/(2p) + (sqrt(3)(1 - t))/(2 q) -1 =0.

Multiplying both sides by 2 p q:

t q + sqrt(3)(1 - t) p - 2 p q =0.

So, t q + sqrt(3) p (1 - t) - 2 p q =0.

Let's collect terms:

( sqrt(3)(1 - t) p ) + ( t q - 2 p q )=0.

Factor out p and q:

p [ sqrt(3)(1 - t) ] + q [ t - 2 p ] =0.

Hmm, not sure if that helps. Maybe I should approach it differently.

Wait, perhaps I should think of p and q as variables, and write the equation in terms of p and q. So, equation (1) is:

(t/(2p)) + (sqrt(3)(1 - t)/(2 q)) =1.

Multiply both sides by 2 p q to eliminate denominators:

t q + sqrt(3)(1 - t) p = 2 p q.

Rearranged:

sqrt(3)(1 - t) p + t q - 2 p q =0.

Wait, perhaps factor terms:

sqrt(3)(1 - t) p + q (t - 2 p) =0.

Hmm, perhaps not helpful. Alternatively, let's express in terms of p and q.

Let me write equation (1):

sqrt(3)(1 - t) p + t q = 2 p q.

Let me bring all terms to one side:

sqrt(3)(1 - t) p + t q - 2 p q =0.

Factor terms with p:

p [ sqrt(3)(1 - t) - 2 q ] + t q =0.

Hmm, not obviously helpful.

Alternatively, perhaps express q from equation (1) in terms of p and t.

From equation (1):

t/(2p) + sqrt(3)(1 - t)/(2 q) =1.

Let me solve for q:

sqrt(3)(1 - t)/(2 q) =1 - t/(2p).

Multiply both sides by 2 q:

sqrt(3)(1 - t) = 2 q (1 - t/(2p)).

Divide both sides by sqrt(3)(1 - t):

1 = (2 q)/(sqrt(3)) * (1 - t/(2p)) / (1 - t).

Wait, maybe that's complicating.

Alternatively, perhaps I can write q in terms of p:

From equation (1):

sqrt(3)(1 - t)/(2 q) =1 - t/(2p).

Multiply both sides by 2 q / sqrt(3)(1 - t):

1 = (2 q)/(sqrt(3)(1 - t)) * (1 - t/(2p)).

Hmm, not helpful.

Perhaps I can consider p and q as variables and use the condition p^2 + q^2 =1.

Wait, maybe a better approach is to consider the system:

sqrt(3)(1 - t) p + t q = 2 p q,

and

p^2 + q^2 =1.

We can solve this system for p and q.

Let me try to solve for p in terms of q or vice versa.

From the first equation:

sqrt(3)(1 - t) p + t q = 2 p q.

Let me rearrange terms:

sqrt(3)(1 - t) p = 2 p q - t q.

Factor q on the right:

sqrt(3)(1 - t) p = q (2 p - t).

So,

sqrt(3)(1 - t) p = q (2 p - t).

Let me solve for q:

q = [ sqrt(3)(1 - t) p ] / (2 p - t).

Now, substitute this into equation (2): p^2 + q^2 =1.

So,

p^2 + [ sqrt(3)(1 - t) p / (2 p - t) ]^2 =1.

Let me write that out:

p^2 + [ 3(1 - t)^2 p^2 ] / (2 p - t)^2 =1.

Let me factor p^2:

p^2 [ 1 + 3(1 - t)^2 / (2 p - t)^2 ] =1.

Let me write:

p^2 [ ( (2 p - t)^2 + 3(1 - t)^2 ) / (2 p - t)^2 ) ] =1.

So,

p^2 [ (4 p^2 -4 p t + t^2 + 3(1 - 2 t + t^2) ) / (2 p - t)^2 ) ] =1.

Compute numerator inside the brackets:

4 p^2 -4 p t + t^2 + 3(1 -2 t + t^2) =4 p^2 -4 p t + t^2 +3 -6 t +3 t^2.

Combine like terms:

4 p^2 + (-4 p t) + (t^2 +3 t^2) + (-6 t) +3.

So,

4 p^2 -4 p t +4 t^2 -6 t +3.

So, the equation becomes:

p^2 [ (4 p^2 -4 p t +4 t^2 -6 t +3 ) / (2 p - t)^2 ) ] =1.

Multiply both sides by (2 p - t)^2:

p^2 (4 p^2 -4 p t +4 t^2 -6 t +3 ) = (2 p - t)^2.

Expand the right-hand side:

(2 p - t)^2 =4 p^2 -4 p t + t^2.

So, left side is p^2 (4 p^2 -4 p t +4 t^2 -6 t +3 ).

So, let me write both sides:

Left: 4 p^4 -4 p^3 t +4 p^2 t^2 -6 p^2 t +3 p^2.

Right:4 p^2 -4 p t + t^2.

Bring all terms to left:

4 p^4 -4 p^3 t +4 p^2 t^2 -6 p^2 t +3 p^2 -4 p^2 +4 p t - t^2 =0.

Simplify term by term:

4 p^4: same.

-4 p^3 t: same.

4 p^2 t^2: same.

-6 p^2 t: same.

3 p^2 -4 p^2: (3 -4)p^2 = -p^2.

+4 p t: same.

- t^2: same.

So, putting it all together:

4 p^4 -4 p^3 t +4 p^2 t^2 -6 p^2 t - p^2 +4 p t - t^2 =0.

This looks messy, but perhaps factor terms:

Let me see:

Group terms:

4 p^4 -4 p^3 t + (4 t^2 -6 t -1) p^2 +4 p t - t^2 =0.

Hmm, quartic in p. Not sure if this can be factored.

Alternatively, perhaps substitute u = p, and write it as a quartic equation in u. But that might not help.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the algebra earlier. Let me double-check.

Wait, perhaps instead of substituting q in terms of p and then plugging into p^2 + q^2 =1, which leads to a quartic, perhaps I can parametrize p and q on the unit circle.

Let me try parameterizing p and q as p = cos θ, q = sin θ, since p^2 + q^2 =1.

Then, equation (1):

(t/(2p)) + (sqrt(3)(1 - t)/(2 q)) =1.

Substituting p = cos θ, q = sin θ:

t/(2 cos θ) + sqrt(3)(1 - t)/(2 sin θ) =1.

Multiply both sides by 2:

t / cos θ + sqrt(3)(1 - t)/ sin θ =2.

Let me write this as:

t sec θ + sqrt(3)(1 - t) csc θ =2.

Hmm, perhaps I can write this equation in terms of sin and cos.

Wait, another approach: Let me denote tan θ = k. Then, sin θ = k / sqrt(1 +k^2), cos θ = 1 / sqrt(1 +k^2).

But maybe that's complicating.

Alternatively, let me set r = tan(theta/2), but that might not help.

Wait, perhaps I can express the equation as:

t sec θ + sqrt(3)(1 - t) csc θ =2.

Let me write this as:

t / cos θ + sqrt(3)(1 - t)/ sin θ =2.

Let me write this as:

t / cos θ + sqrt(3)(1 - t)/ sin θ =2.

Let me write everything in terms of sin θ and cos θ:

Multiply both sides by sin θ cos θ:

t sin θ + sqrt(3)(1 - t) cos θ = 2 sin θ cos θ.

So,

t sin θ + sqrt(3)(1 - t) cos θ = sin(2 θ).

Hmm, interesting. So, equation becomes:

t sin θ + sqrt(3)(1 - t) cos θ = sin(2 θ).

Now, perhaps I can write the left side as a single sinusoidal function.

Recall that A sin θ + B cos θ = C sin(theta + phi), where C = sqrt(A^2 + B^2), and tan phi = B/A.

So, let me compute A and B:

A = t,

B = sqrt(3)(1 - t).

So,

C = sqrt(t^2 + 3(1 - t)^2).

And,

tan phi = B / A = sqrt(3)(1 - t)/t.

So, the left side can be written as:

sqrt(t^2 + 3(1 - t)^2) sin(theta + phi) = sin(2 theta).

Hmm, but I don't know. Maybe another approach.

Alternatively, perhaps we can square both sides to eliminate theta.

So, starting from:

t sin θ + sqrt(3)(1 - t) cos θ = sin(2 theta).

Square both sides:

[ t sin θ + sqrt(3)(1 - t) cos theta ]^2 = sin^2(2 theta).

Left side:

t^2 sin^2 theta + 2 t sqrt(3)(1 - t) sin theta cos theta + 3(1 - t)^2 cos^2 theta.

Right side:

sin^2(2 theta) =4 sin^2 theta cos^2 theta.

So, equation becomes:

t^2 sin^2 theta + 2 t sqrt(3)(1 - t) sin theta cos theta +3 (1 - t)^2 cos^2 theta =4 sin^2 theta cos^2 theta.

Hmm, this seems complicated, but perhaps we can express everything in terms of sin^2 theta and cos^2 theta.

Let me denote s = sin theta, c = cos theta.

Then, s^2 + c^2 =1.

Equation becomes:

t^2 s^2 + 2 t sqrt(3)(1 - t) s c +3 (1 - t)^2 c^2 =4 s^2 c^2.

Bring all terms to left:

t^2 s^2 + 2 t sqrt(3)(1 - t) s c +3 (1 - t)^2 c^2 -4 s^2 c^2 =0.

Factor terms:

s^2 ( t^2 -4 c^2 ) + c^2 (3 (1 - t)^2 ) + 2 t sqrt(3)(1 - t) s c =0.

Hmm, not helpful. Alternatively, perhaps factor s^2 and c^2.

Wait, another idea: let me express the equation as:

t^2 s^2 + 3(1 - t)^2 c^2 + 2 t sqrt(3)(1 - t) s c =4 s^2 c^2.

Let me bring all terms to left:

t^2 s^2 +3(1 - t)^2 c^2 +2 t sqrt(3)(1 - t) s c -4 s^2 c^2 =0.

Not obvious.

Alternatively, perhaps use substitution variables. Let me set u = s/c = tan theta.

Then, s = u c, and since s^2 + c^2=1, we have u^2 c^2 + c^2 =1 => c^2 =1/(1 + u^2).

So, let me substitute s = u c into the equation.

Equation becomes:

t^2 (u^2 c^2) +3 (1 - t)^2 c^2 + 2 t sqrt(3)(1 - t) (u c) c -4 (u^2 c^2) c^2=0.

Simplify each term:

t^2 u^2 c^2 +3 (1 - t)^2 c^2 + 2 t sqrt(3)(1 - t) u c^2 -4 u^2 c^4 =0.

Factor c^2:

c^2 [ t^2 u^2 +3 (1 - t)^2 + 2 t sqrt(3)(1 - t) u ] -4 u^2 c^4 =0.

But c^2 =1/(1 + u^2). So, c^4 =1/(1 + u^2)^2.

Substitute c^2 and c^4:

[1/(1 + u^2)] [ t^2 u^2 +3 (1 - t)^2 + 2 t sqrt(3)(1 - t) u ] -4 u^2 [1/(1 + u^2)^2 ]=0.

Multiply both sides by (1 + u^2)^2 to eliminate denominators:

(1 + u^2) [ t^2 u^2 +3 (1 - t)^2 + 2 t sqrt(3)(1 - t) u ] -4 u^2 =0.

Expand the first term:

t^2 u^2 (1 + u^2) +3(1 - t)^2 (1 + u^2) +2 t sqrt(3)(1 - t) u (1 + u^2) -4 u^2 =0.

This is getting too complicated. Maybe there's a smarter approach.

Wait, perhaps instead of parametrizing with theta, we can think geometrically.

Each segment PQ in F is a line from (p,0) to (0,q), with p^2 + q^2=1.

The point C(t) is (t/2, sqrt(3)(1 - t)/2).

We need C(t) not to lie on any PQ except AB.

So, in other words, for any other PQ (p, q) in F, the point C(t) is not on PQ.

Thus, for the system:

x/p + y/q =1,

x = t/2,

y = sqrt(3)(1 - t)/2.

We want that this system has only one solution, which is when PQ is AB.

Which implies that the line x/p + y/q =1 is tangent to the line AB at point C(t). But line AB is fixed.

Wait, no, because AB is a specific PQ in F.

Wait, perhaps C(t) is the point where the envelope of all PQ in F touches AB.

Wait, envelope... Hmm, maybe that's a good approach.

The envelope of a family of curves is a curve that is tangent to each member of the family at some point.

In this case, the family F is lines PQ. So, the envelope would be a curve that is tangent to each PQ in F at some point.

But our problem is about a point C on AB that is not on any other PQ in F except AB itself. So, perhaps C is the point where AB is tangent to the envelope of F.

Wait, that sounds promising.

So, if I can find the envelope of F, then the point C is the intersection of AB and the envelope.

To find the envelope, we can use the method of solving for the condition that the system of equations (the line PQ and the envelope) has a double solution, i.e., the line is tangent to the envelope.

Wait, let me recall the method for finding the envelope of a family of curves.

Given a family of curves F(p, q, x, y)=0, where p is a parameter, the envelope satisfies F(p, q, x, y)=0 and dF/dp =0.

In our case, the family is x/p + y/q =1, with p^2 + q^2=1.

Wait, so we can treat q as a function of p, since p^2 + q^2=1. So, q = sqrt(1 - p^2), but since we are in the first quadrant, q is positive.

So, the equation of PQ can be written as x/p + y/sqrt(1 - p^2) =1, with p in (0,1).

So, the family is F(p, x, y) = x/p + y/sqrt(1 - p^2) -1 =0.

To find the envelope, we solve F(p, x, y)=0 and dF/dp=0.

Compute dF/dp:

dF/dp = (-x)/p^2 + [ y * (p) ] / (1 - p^2)^(3/2) )=0.

So, set dF/dp=0:

(-x)/p^2 + (y p)/(1 - p^2)^(3/2) )=0.

So, 

(y p)/( (1 - p^2)^(3/2) ) = x / p^2.

Let me write this as:

y p * p^2 = x (1 - p^2)^(3/2).

So,

y p^3 = x (1 - p^2)^(3/2).

Let me express (1 - p^2)^(3/2) as (1 - p^2) * sqrt(1 - p^2).

So,

y p^3 = x (1 - p^2) sqrt(1 - p^2).

Hmm, not sure if that's helpful.

Alternatively, square both sides to eliminate the square root.

From:

y p^3 = x (1 - p^2)^{3/2}.

Squaring both sides:

y^2 p^6 = x^2 (1 - p^2)^3.

Let me write this as:

y^2 p^6 = x^2 (1 - 3 p^2 + 3 p^4 - p^6).

Bring all terms to left:

y^2 p^6 -x^2 +3 x^2 p^2 -3 x^2 p^4 +x^2 p^6 =0.

Factor terms:

p^6 (y^2 +x^2) + p^2 (3 x^2) -3 x^2 p^4 -x^2 =0.

Hmm, perhaps factor differently. Let me arrange by powers of p:

(y^2 +x^2) p^6 -3 x^2 p^4 +3 x^2 p^2 -x^2 =0.

This is a cubic equation in p^2.

Let me set z = p^2.

Then, equation becomes:

(y^2 +x^2) z^3 -3 x^2 z^2 +3 x^2 z -x^2 =0.

Hmm, seems complicated. Maybe I can find a factor.

Let me try z=1:

(y^2 +x^2)(1) -3 x^2 (1) +3 x^2 (1) -x^2 = y^2 +x^2 -3x^2 +3x^2 -x^2= y^2 +x^2 -x^2= y^2. Not zero unless y=0, which it's not.

Wait, perhaps z= x/(y +x)? Not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps use the original equation F(p, x, y)=0: x/p + y/sqrt(1 - p^2) =1.

We have two equations:

1. x/p + y/sqrt(1 - p^2) =1,

2. y p^3 = x (1 - p^2)^{3/2}.

Let me solve equation 2 for y:

y = [x (1 - p^2)^{3/2} ] / p^3.

Substitute into equation 1:

x/p + [ x (1 - p^2)^{3/2} / p^3 ] / sqrt(1 - p^2) =1.

Simplify:

x/p + [ x (1 - p^2)^{3/2} ] / [ p^3 sqrt(1 - p^2) ) ] =1.

Simplify the second term:

(1 - p^2)^{3/2} / sqrt(1 - p^2) )= (1 - p^2)^{ (3/2 -1/2) }= (1 - p^2)^1=1 -p^2.

So, equation becomes:

x/p + x (1 - p^2)/p^3 =1.

Factor x:

x [ 1/p + (1 - p^2)/p^3 ] =1.

Compute inside the brackets:

( p^2 +1 - p^2 ) / p^3 =1/p^3.

Wait, let me compute:

1/p + (1 - p^2)/p^3 = [ p^2 +1 - p^2 ] / p^3 =1 / p^3.

So, equation becomes:

x * (1 / p^3 ) =1.

So,

x = p^3.

So, from this, x = p^3.

Then, from equation 2:

y = [x (1 - p^2)^{3/2} ] / p^3.

Substitute x = p^3:

y = [ p^3 (1 - p^2)^{3/2} ] / p^3 = (1 - p^2)^{3/2}.

So, we have:

x = p^3,

y = (1 - p^2)^{3/2}.

So, the envelope is parametrized by p:

x = p^3,

y = (1 - p^2)^{3/2}.

To eliminate p and find the relation between x and y.

Let me express p in terms of x.

From x = p^3, we have p = x^{1/3}.

Then,

y = (1 - (x^{1/3})^2 )^{3/2} = (1 -x^{2/3})^{3/2}.

So, raise both sides to the 2/3 power:

y^{2/3} = 1 -x^{2/3}.

So,

x^{2/3} + y^{2/3} =1.

That's the equation of the envelope: x^{2/3} + y^{2/3}=1.

So, the envelope is an astroid.

Now, the point C lies on AB and on the envelope, because it's the unique point where AB is tangent to the envelope.

So, to find point C, we can solve the system:

x^{2/3} + y^{2/3}=1,

and

y = -sqrt(3) (x -1/2).

So, substituting y from AB into the envelope equation.

So,

x^{2/3} + [ -sqrt(3)(x -1/2) ]^{2/3}=1.

Let me compute [ -sqrt(3)(x -1/2) ]^{2/3}.

First, since we're raising to 2/3, which is an even root followed by a cube, it's equivalent to [ (sqrt(3)(x -1/2))^2 ]^{1/3}.

Wait, but the exponent is 2/3, which can be written as (something)^{2/3}.

But note that [ -sqrt(3)(x -1/2) ]^{2/3} = [ (sqrt(3)(x -1/2))^2 ]^{1/3}.

Because (-a)^{2/3} = (a^2)^{1/3}.

So,

x^{2/3} + [ (sqrt(3)(x -1/2))^2 ]^{1/3}=1.

Compute (sqrt(3)(x -1/2))^2:

= 3 (x -1/2)^2.

So,

x^{2/3} + [3 (x -1/2)^2 ]^{1/3}=1.

Let me write [3 (x -1/2)^2 ]^{1/3}= [3]^{1/3} (x -1/2)^{2/3}.

So,

x^{2/3} + [3]^{1/3} (x -1/2)^{2/3} =1.

Let me denote u = x^{1/3}.

Then, x = u^3.

Similarly, (x -1/2)^{1/3} = (u^3 -1/2)^{1/3}.

But this might complicate things.

Alternatively, let me set t = x^{1/3}, so x = t^3.

Then, (x -1/2) = t^3 -1/2.

So, (x -1/2)^{2/3}= (t^3 -1/2)^{2/3}.

Hmm, not helpful.

Alternatively, let me set z = x^{1/3}, so x = z^3.

Then, equation becomes:

(z^3)^{2/3} + [3 (z^3 -1/2)^2 ]^{1/3}=1.

Simplify:

z^2 + [3 (z^3 -1/2)^2 ]^{1/3}=1.

Not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps cube both sides. Let me consider:

Let me denote A = x^{2/3}, B = [3 (x -1/2)^2 ]^{1/3}.

So, equation is A + B =1.

Cube both sides:

(A + B)^3 =1.

Which is A^3 + 3 A^2 B + 3 A B^2 + B^3 =1.

Compute each term:

A^3 = (x^{2/3})^3 =x^2.

B^3 = [3 (x -1/2)^2 ]^{1/3 *3}=3 (x -1/2)^2.

So,

x^2 + 3 A^2 B + 3 A B^2 +3(x -1/2)^2 =1.

Hmm, but this seems to get more complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps let me make a substitution.

Let me let u = x^{1/3}, v = y^{1/3}.

But since y = -sqrt(3)(x -1/2), maybe that's not helpful.

Alternatively, perhaps consider that the point C is on AB, so plug in y from AB into the envelope equation.

Given that AB is y = -sqrt(3)(x -1/2).

So, substituting into envelope equation:

x^{2/3} + [ -sqrt(3)(x -1/2) ]^{2/3}=1.

Which is:

x^{2/3} + [ sqrt(3)(1/2 -x) ]^{2/3}=1.

Because [ -sqrt(3)(x -1/2) ]^{2/3} = [ sqrt(3)(1/2 -x) ]^{2/3}.

So,

x^{2/3} + [ sqrt(3)(1/2 -x) ]^{2/3}=1.

Let me denote [ sqrt(3)(1/2 -x) ]^{2/3} as [3^{1/2} (1/2 -x) ]^{2/3}= 3^{1/3} (1/2 -x)^{2/3}.

So,

x^{2/3} + 3^{1/3} (1/2 -x)^{2/3}=1.

Let me let u = x^{1/3}, v = (1/2 -x)^{1/3}.

Then, the equation becomes:

u^2 + 3^{1/3} v^2=1.

But since v = (1/2 -x)^{1/3}= (1/2 - u^3)^{1/3}.

Hmm, not helpful.

Alternatively, perhaps let me set t = x^{1/3}, so that x = t^3.

Then, (1/2 -x) =1/2 -t^3.

So,

x^{2/3}= t^2,

and (1/2 -x)^{2/3}= (1/2 -t^3)^{2/3}.

So, the equation becomes:

t^2 +3^{1/3} (1/2 -t^3)^{2/3}=1.

This seems complicated, but perhaps we can solve numerically or find a substitution.

Alternatively, perhaps make another substitution.

Let me set w = t^3.

But then w =x.

Wait, maybe not helpful.

Alternatively, perhaps consider that the equation is symmetric in some way.

Wait, perhaps let me consider that the solution for x is (1/2), but that's point A, which is already on AB and on F as PQ=AB.

But we need another point C on AB that's not on any other PQ in F. So, perhaps the envelope meets AB at C and at A.

But we need to find another intersection point.

Wait, perhaps I can consider that the envelope x^{2/3} + y^{2/3}=1 meets AB at two points: A and C.

So, let me solve for x in the system:

x^{2/3} + y^{2/3}=1,

y = -sqrt(3)(x -1/2).

Substitute y into the envelope equation:

x^{2/3} + [ -sqrt(3)(x -1/2) ]^{2/3}=1.

Which is the same as:

x^{2/3} + [sqrt(3)(1/2 -x)]^{2/3}=1.

Let me denote z =x^{1/3}.

Then, x = z^3,

and 1/2 -x =1/2 - z^3.

So,

z^2 + [sqrt(3)(1/2 - z^3)]^{2/3}=1.

Compute [sqrt(3)(1/2 -z^3)]^{2/3}= [3^{1/2} (1/2 - z^3)]^{2/3}=3^{1/3} (1/2 - z^3)^{2/3}.

So,

z^2 +3^{1/3} (1/2 - z^3)^{2/3}=1.

This seems still complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps we can let u = z^3, but I don't think that helps.

Alternatively, perhaps assume a value for z and see if it satisfies the equation.

Wait, let me think about the point C. It's on AB between A(1/2,0) and B(0, sqrt(3)/2). So, x ranges from 0 to 1/2.

Wait, no, AB is from A(1/2,0) to B(0, sqrt(3)/2). So, x goes from 1/2 to 0 as we move from A to B.

Wait, but the envelope x^{2/3} + y^{2/3}=1 is an astroid.

The astroid is a curve in the first quadrant since x and y are positive here.

Wait, but the point C is in the first quadrant as well.

Wait, but the astroid equation is x^{2/3} + y^{2/3}=1, which is a closed curve in the first quadrant.

So, point C is the intersection of the astroid and the line AB in the first quadrant, other than point A.

Wait, point A is (1/2, 0). Plugging into the astroid equation:

(1/2)^{2/3} +0= (1/2)^{2/3} ≈0.63. Which is less than 1. So, point A is inside the astroid.

But wait, the envelope is the astroid, which is the boundary. So, points on the envelope are on the boundary, but point A is inside.

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake earlier.

Wait, the envelope of the family F is the astroid x^{2/3} + y^{2/3}=1, which is a convex curve in the first quadrant.

Our line AB connects A(1/2,0) to B(0, sqrt(3)/2). So, B is (0, sqrt(3)/2) ≈(0, 0.866). Plugging into the astroid equation:

0 + (sqrt(3)/2)^{2/3}= (3^{1/2}/2)^{2/3}= (3^{1/2})^{2/3} /2^{2/3}= 3^{1/3}/2^{2/3}.

Compute 3^{1/3} ≈1.442, 2^{2/3}≈1.587, so 1.442/1.587≈0.908<1. So, point B is also inside the astroid.

Hmm, so both A and B are inside the astroid, but the line AB connects them, crossing the astroid somewhere.

So, the astroid is the envelope, meaning each PQ in F is tangent to the astroid. So, AB is one of those tangent lines, touching the astroid at point C.

Wait, so AB is tangent to the astroid at point C, which is the point of contact.

So, we can find point C by finding the point where AB is tangent to the astroid x^{2/3} + y^{2/3}=1.

Thus, to find the point of tangency, we can set up the condition that AB has a double intersection with the astroid, i.e., it is tangent.

So, substituting y = -sqrt(3)(x -1/2) into x^{2/3} + y^{2/3}=1, we get a system where the line intersects the astroid at point C with multiplicity two.

So, let me substitute y into the astroid equation:

x^{2/3} + [ -sqrt(3)(x -1/2) ]^{2/3}=1.

As before, simplifies to:

x^{2/3} + [sqrt(3)(1/2 -x)]^{2/3}=1.

Let me write this as:

x^{2/3} + (3)^{1/3} (1/2 -x)^{2/3}=1.

Let me denote u =x^{1/3}, v=(1/2 -x)^{1/3}.

So, the equation becomes:

u^2 + 3^{1/3} v^2 =1.

But, since v = (1/2 -x)^{1/3} = (1/2 - u^3)^{1/3}.

This substitution might not help, but perhaps consider that the system has a double solution.

So, the equation after substitution must have a repeated root, which occurs when the derivative is zero.

Alternatively, perhaps proceed by parametrizing.

Let me let x = t^3, then x^{2/3}= t^2.

Then, 1/2 -x =1/2 -t^3,

so (1/2 -x)^{2/3}= (1/2 -t^3)^{2/3}.

So, equation becomes:

t^2 +3^{1/3} (1/2 -t^3)^{2/3}=1.

Hmm, difficult to solve analytically. Maybe try to find a value of t that satisfies this equation.

Alternatively, perhaps use substitution.

Let me let s = t^3, so t = s^{1/3}.

Then,

t^2 =s^{2/3},

and 1/2 -t^3=1/2 -s.

So,

s^{2/3} +3^{1/3} (1/2 -s)^{2/3}=1.

Hmm, still complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps make the substitution z = s^{1/3}, but not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps use trial and error.

Let me test t=1/2:

x= (1/2)^3=1/8,

then, 1/2 -x=3/8,

so (3/8)^{2/3}= (3)^{2/3}/(8)^{2/3}=3^{2/3}/4.

So,

x^{2/3}= (1/8)^{2/3}=1/4,

so equation:1/4 +3^{1/3}*(3^{2/3}/4)=1/4 + (3^{1/3 +2/3})/4=1/4 +3/4=1.

So, t=1/2 is a solution. Therefore, x= (1/2)^3=1/8.

So, x=1/8, then y= -sqrt(3)(1/8 -1/2)= -sqrt(3)*(-3/8)= (3 sqrt(3))/8.

So, the point C is (1/8, 3 sqrt(3)/8).

Wait, but is this correct?

Wait, let me verify:

x=1/8,

y= -sqrt(3)(1/8 -1/2)= -sqrt(3)*(-3/8)= (3 sqrt(3))/8.

So, plugging into the envelope equation:

x^{2/3} + y^{2/3}= (1/8)^{2/3} + (3 sqrt(3)/8)^{2/3}.

Compute (1/8)^{2/3}= (1/2^3)^{2/3}=1/2^2=1/4.

Compute (3 sqrt(3)/8)^{2/3}= [3^{3/2}/8 ]^{2/3}= [3^{3/2}]^{2/3}/8^{2/3}=3^{(3/2 * 2/3)} /4=3^{1}/4=3/4.

So, total x^{2/3} + y^{2/3}=1/4 +3/4=1. Correct.

So, point C is (1/8, 3 sqrt(3)/8).

So, OC^2 is (1/8)^2 + (3 sqrt(3)/8)^2=1/64 + (27)/64=28/64=7/16.

Wait, 1^2=1, (3 sqrt(3))^2=9*3=27, so total (1 +27)/64=28/64=7/16.

So, OC^2=7/16.

Thus, p=7, q=16, p+q=23.

Wait, but earlier, when I tried to solve the quadratic for t, I got t=(3 ±sqrt(13))/4, but those were outside [0,1]. But through the envelope approach, I got a valid t=1/2, which gives x=1/8.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the earlier approach when I tried to set the line tangent to the unit circle. It seems that the envelope method gives the correct point C.

So, the answer is OC^2=7/16, so p+q=7+16=23.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To solve the problem, we first identify the equation of line segment AB. Points A and B have coordinates (1/2, 0) and (0, √3/2), respectively. The slope of AB is -√3, leading to the equation y = -√3(x - 1/2).

Next, we consider the family of segments PQ of unit length, where P is on the x-axis and Q is on the y-axis. Each segment PQ satisfies p² + q² = 1, and its equation is x/p + y/q = 1.

We need to find a point C on AB that does not lie on any other segment from this family except AB itself. This point C is where the line AB is tangent to the envelope of the family of segments PQ.

The envelope of the family of curves x/p + y/q = 1, with p² + q² = 1, is found to be the astroid x^(2/3) + y^(2/3) = 1.

To find the point of tangency, we substitute y = -√3(x - 1/2) into the astroid equation:

x^(2/3) + [√3(1/2 - x)]^(2/3) = 1.

By solving this equation, we find that x = 1/8 and y = (3√3)/8. Thus, point C is (1/8, 3√3/8).

Finally, we calculate OC²:

OC² = (1/8)² + (3√3/8)² = 1/64 + 27/64 = 28/64 = 7/16.

Therefore, p = 7 and q = 16, leading to p + q = 23.

\boxed{23}
