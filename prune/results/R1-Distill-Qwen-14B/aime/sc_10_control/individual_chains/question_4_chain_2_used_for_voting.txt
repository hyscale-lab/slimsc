Okay, so I've got this problem where Alice and Bob are playing a game with a stack of n tokens. They take turns removing either 1 or 4 tokens. Alice goes first, and whoever takes the last token wins. I need to find how many positive integers n ≤ 2024 where Bob can guarantee a win, no matter how Alice plays.

Hmm, let me start by understanding the game better. It seems similar to other impartial games like Nim, but with specific move options. The key here is to figure out for each n whether the starting player (Alice) can force a win or if the second player (Bob) can.

I remember that in such games, we can often determine winning and losing positions. A winning position is one where the current player can force a win regardless of what the opponent does. A losing position is the opposite—no matter what the current player does, the opponent can force a win.

So, I should probably try to find a pattern or a mathematical expression that tells whether a position is winning or losing. Maybe I can use recursion or dynamic programming for this.

Let's denote the positions as either winning (W) or losing (L). For n=0, that's a losing position because there are no tokens to take, so the player can't make a move. Wait, but in the problem statement, the player who takes the last token wins. So, if n=0, the game is already over, so the previous player took the last token. So, n=0 is a losing position for the current player.

Let me make a table for small n to see the pattern.

n | winner (if both play optimally)
--- | ---
0 | L (current player loses)
1 | W (take 1 token, win)
2 | W (take 1, opponent gets 1 which is W, so you can win)
Wait, no. Let's think carefully.

For each n, determine if the current player can win.

n=0: L (no move)
n=1: Current player takes 1, wins. So W.
n=2: Current player can take 1, leaving n=1 for opponent. Since n=1 is W, the opponent can win. So, if I take 1, opponent can win. Alternatively, can I take 4? No, because n=2 <4. So only move is to take 1, which leads to opponent winning. So n=2 is L.
Wait, that can't be right. Because if I take 1 from n=2, opponent gets n=1 which is a winning position for them. So I can't force a win. So n=2 is L.

n=3: Current player can take 1, leaving n=2 which is L for opponent. So opponent is in a losing position. So n=3 is W.
n=4: Current player can take 4, leaving n=0, which is L. So opponent loses. So n=4 is W.

n=5: Current player can take 1 or 4.
If take 1: leaves n=4, which is W for opponent.
If take 4: leaves n=1, which is W for opponent.
So n=5 is L because all moves lead to opponent's W position.

n=6: Current player can take 1, leaving n=5 (L for opponent). So opponent is in losing position. So n=6 is W.

n=7: Current player can take 1, leaving n=6 (W for opponent). Or take 4, leaving n=3 (W for opponent). So both moves leave opponent in W. So n=7 is L.

Wait, is that right? Let me double-check.

Wait, n=5 is L. So for n=6, taking 1 leaves n=5 (L), which is good for current player. So n=6 is W.

n=7: taking 1 leaves n=6 (W), taking 4 leaves n=3 (W). So all moves leave opponent in W. So n=7 is L.

n=8: taking 1 leads to n=7 (L), so current player can win by taking 1. So n=8 is W.

n=9: taking 1 leads to n=8 (W). Taking 4 leads to n=5 (L). So, if current player takes 4, opponent gets n=5 (L), so current player can win. So n=9 is W.

n=10: taking 1 leads to n=9 (W). Taking 4 leads to n=6 (W). So both moves leave opponent in W. So n=10 is L.

Hmm, let's list these out:

n : 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10
Result: L W L W W L W L W W L

Wait, so the pattern seems to repeat every 5? Let me check the sequence.

Looking at the results:

n=0: L
n=1: W
n=2: L
n=3: W
n=4: W
n=5: L
n=6: W
n=7: L
n=8: W
n=9: W
n=10: L
n=11: W
n=12: L
n=13: W
n=14: W
n=15: L
n=16: W
n=17: L
n=18: W
n=19: W
n=20: L

So from n=0 to 4: L, W, L, W, W
n=5 to 9: L, W, L, W, W
n=10 to 14: L, W, L, W, W
And so on.

So the pattern repeats every 5 numbers. The losing positions are n=0,2,5,7,10,12,15,17,20,...

Looking at the losing positions: 0,2,5,7,10,12,15,17,20,...

What's the pattern here? Let's see the differences between them.

From 0 to 2: +2

2 to 5: +3

5 to 7: +2

7 to10:+3

10 to12:+2

12 to15:+3

15 to17:+2

17 to20:+3

So the pattern alternates between adding 2 and 3.

So starting from 0, add 2, get 2. Then add 3 to get 5. Add 2 to get 7. Add 3 to get 10, and so on.

So the losing positions can be expressed as:

0, 2, 5, 7, 10, 12, 15, 17, 20, 22, etc.

So every 5 numbers, the pattern repeats.

So to find all n ≤2024 where n is a losing position, we can model the losing positions as numbers congruent to 0,2 mod 5? Wait, no.

Wait, let's see:

n=0: 0 mod5=0

n=2: 2 mod5=2

n=5:5 mod5=0

n=7:7 mod5=2

n=10:10 mod5=0

n=12:12 mod5=2

So the losing positions are numbers where n mod5 is 0 or 2.

Wait, let's check n=5, which is 0 mod5. So yes, the losing positions are n ≡0 or 2 mod5.

But wait, let's check n=17:17 mod5=2, which is a losing position.

n=20 mod5=0, losing.

n=22 mod5=2, losing.

Yes, this seems to hold.

Wait, but let's confirm with n=10: 10 mod5=0, which is a losing position.

n=1:1 mod5=1 → winning.

n=3:3 mod5=3→winning.

n=4:4 mod5=4→winning.

n=6:1 mod5=1→winning.

Wait, n=6 mod5=1, which is a winning position, which matches our earlier table.

So the losing positions are n where n mod5 is 0 or 2.

But wait, looking back, n=5: 5 mod5=0, which is a losing position.

n=7:7 mod5=2, also losing.

n=10:10 mod5=0, losing.

So the losing positions are when n ≡0 or 2 mod5.

So, for the original problem, Bob can win if and only if n is a losing position for Alice, which is when n mod5 is 0 or 2.

Thus, the count is the number of n ≤2024 where n mod5 is 0 or 2.

So, how many numbers ≤2024 are ≡0 mod5?

That's floor(2024/5) +1 if 2024 is divisible by5.

Wait, 2024 divided by5 is 404.8, so 404 full multiples, and 2024=5*404 +4. So the largest multiple of5 ≤2024 is 5*404=2020.

So numbers ≡0 mod5: 0,5,10,...,2020. The count is 2020/5 +1=404+1=405 numbers. Wait, no, wait.

Wait, the number of terms in the sequence a, a+d, a+2d,..., L is floor((L -a)/d) +1.

Here, a=0, d=5, L=2020.

So number of terms is (2020-0)/5 +1=404+1=405.

Similarly, numbers ≡2 mod5: 2,7,12,..., up to ≤2024.

What's the largest number ≡2 mod5 ≤2024? Let's see: 2024 divided by5 is 404.8, so 5*404=2020, 2020+2=2022. So the largest is 2022.

So numbers ≡2 mod5: 2,7,12,...,2022.

Number of terms: ((2022 -2)/5)+1= (2020/5)+1=404+1=405.

So total numbers where n mod5 is 0 or 2 is 405 +405=810.

Wait, but wait. Wait, 0 is included, but the problem says positive integers n ≤2024. So n=0 is excluded.

Wait, in the problem statement, it's about positive integers n. So n starts at 1, not 0.

So for n≡0 mod5: numbers are 5,10,15,...,2020. So how many terms?

The first term is 5, last term 2020, common difference 5.

Number of terms: ((2020 -5)/5)+1 = (2015/5)+1=403 +1=404.

Similarly, for n≡2 mod5: starting at 2, next 7,12,...,2022.

Number of terms: ((2022-2)/5)+1=2020/5+1=404+1=405.

Wait, wait: 2022-2=2020, 2020/5=404. So 404+1=405 terms.

So total losing positions are 404 (for 0 mod5) +405 (for2 mod5)=809.

Wait, but wait, 2024 is the upper limit. So for n≡2 mod5, the last term is 2022, which is ≤2024. So that's fine.

But n=2025 would be next, but we don't include that.

So total losing positions where n≤2024 are 404 +405=809.

So the answer should be 809.

Wait, but let me double-check. Let's think about it differently.

Total numbers from 1 to 2024:2024 numbers.

Each residue mod5 appears either floor(2024/5)=404 or 405 times.

Residues 0,1,2,3,4.

Number of numbers ≡0 mod5: floor(2024/5)=404 (since 5*404=2020, which is ≤2024, and 5*405=2025>2024).

Similarly, numbers ≡1 mod5: 405.

Numbers ≡2 mod5: 405.

Numbers ≡3 mod5: 405.

Numbers ≡4 mod5:404.

Because 2024=5*404 +4. So residues 0:404, 1:405, 2:405, 3:405,4:404.

So, n≡0 mod5:404 numbers.

n≡2 mod5:405 numbers.

So total losing positions:404 +405=809.

Yes, that seems correct.

So the number of positive integers n ≤2024 where Bob can guarantee a win is 809.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the number of positive integers \( n \leq 2024 \) for which Bob can guarantee a win, we analyze the game's winning and losing positions. A losing position is one where the current player cannot force a win, regardless of the opponent's moves.

We observe that the losing positions occur at \( n \equiv 0 \) or \( 2 \pmod{5} \). This pattern repeats every 5 numbers. 

- For \( n \equiv 0 \pmod{5} \), there are 404 numbers between 1 and 2024.
- For \( n \equiv 2 \pmod{5} \), there are 405 numbers between 1 and 2024.

Adding these, the total number of losing positions is \( 404 + 405 = 809 \).

Thus, the number of positive integers \( n \leq 2024 \) where Bob can guarantee a win is \(\boxed{809}\).
