Okay, so Alice and Bob are playing this game with a stack of n tokens. They take turns, Alice goes first. On each turn, a player can remove either 1 or 4 tokens. The person who takes the last token wins. I need to find how many positive integers n ≤ 2024 make Bob the winner, no matter how Alice plays. 

Hmm, let's think about this. It sounds like a classic game theory problem, probably involving finding winning and losing positions. A winning position is one where the current player can force a win, and a losing position is one where no matter what the current player does, the opponent can force a win.

So, the key is to determine for each n whether it's a winning or losing position. If n is a losing position, then Bob can win if Alice starts with that n. Wait, no, wait. Actually, if n is a losing position, then the player who has to move (in this case, Alice) will lose if both play optimally. So, if n is a losing position, Bob can win. So, the question is: how many losing positions are there up to 2024?

Let me try to model this.

Let’s denote the positions as either winning (W) or losing (L). The base case is n=0. If there are no tokens left, the game is over, so the player who just moved wins. So, n=0 is a losing position because the player can't make a move.

Wait, no, actually, if n=0, the previous player has already taken the last token and won. So, in this game, the initial player is Alice. So, if n=0, the game is over, and the previous player (Bob, if it was Bob's turn) has already won. Wait, maybe I should think of n=0 as a losing position for the current player because they can't make a move.

Wait, perhaps it's better to define the positions as follows: for each n, if the current player can force a win, it's W; else, it's L.

So, n=0: current player can't move, so it's a losing position.

n=1: current player can take 1 token and win, so W.

n=2: take 1, leaving n=1 for the opponent. But n=1 is a winning position for the opponent, so they can win. Wait, but if n=2, current player can take 1, leaving n=1. But if the opponent is faced with n=1, they can take it and win. So, is n=2 a losing position? Or can the current player take 4? No, n=2 <4, so they can't take 4, only 1. So, taking 1 leaves n=1 for the opponent, who can then win. So, n=2 is a losing position. Hmm, wait, but that can't be right because the current player can take 1, and opponent is forced to take 1, then current player can take 1 and win? Wait, no, n=2: current player takes 1, leaves n=1. Opponent takes 1 and wins. So, n=2 is a losing position.

Wait, maybe I should think through small n step by step.

Let me list n from 0 upwards and mark them as W or L.

n=0: L (can't move)
n=1: can take 1, so W.
n=2: can take 1, leaving n=1 (W for opponent). So, opponent can win. So, is n=2 a losing position? Because whatever you do, opponent can win. So n=2 is L.
n=3: take 1, leaving n=2 (L). So, opponent is in losing position; so n=3 is W.
n=4: can take 1, leaving n=3 (W), or take 4, leaving n=0 (L). So, taking 4 would leave opponent with n=0, which is L, meaning opponent can't win. So, n=4 is W.
n=5: can take 1, leaving n=4 (W), or take 4, leaving n=1 (W). So, both options leave opponent in W positions. So, n=5 is L.
n=6: can take 1, leaving n=5 (L), so opponent is in L. So, n=6 is W.
n=7: take 1, leaving n=6 (W). Or take 4, leaving n=3 (W). So, regardless, opponent can win. So, n=7 is L.
n=8: take 1, leaving n=7 (L). So, opponent is in L. So, n=8 is W.
n=9: take 1, leaving n=8 (W); take 4, leaving n=5 (L). So, taking 4 leaves opponent in L. So, n=9 is W.
Wait, because taking 4 from n=9 leaves n=5, which is L, so opponent can't win. So, n=9 is W.
n=10: take 1, leaves n=9 (W); take 4, leaves n=6 (W). So, both options lead to opponent in W. So, n=10 is L.
n=11: take 1, leaves n=10 (L). So, n=11 is W.
n=12: take 1, leaves n=11 (W); take 4, leaves n=8 (W). So, n=12 is L.
n=13: take 1, leaves n=12 (L). So, n=13 is W.
n=14: take 1, leaves n=13 (W); take 4, leaves n=10 (L). So, n=14 is W.
n=15: take 1, leaves n=14 (W); take 4, leaves n=11 (W). So, n=15 is L.
n=16: take 1, leaves n=15 (L). So, n=16 is W.

Wait, let me tabulate these:

n | outcome
0 | L
1 | W
2 | L
3 | W
4 | W
5 | L
6 | W
7 | L
8 | W
9 | W
10 | L
11 | W
12 | L
13 | W
14 | W
15 | L
16 | W

Hmm, looking for a pattern. Let me see:

Looking at the outcomes, from n=0, the pattern is L, W, L, W, W, L, W, L, W, W, L, W, L, W, W, L, W...

So, the pattern seems to repeat every 5 numbers: L, W, L, W, W, then L, W, L, W, W, etc. Let's check:

From n=0:

0: L
1: W
2: L
3: W
4: W
5: L
6: W
7: L
8: W
9: W
10: L
11: W
12: L
13: W
14: W
15: L
16: W

Yes, the pattern repeats every 5. So, positions 0,5,10,15,... are L. So, multiples of 5 are losing positions?

Wait, n=5: L
n=10: L
n=15: L
So, yes, every 5n is L.

Wait, but let's check n=20: would that be L?

n=17: take 1, leaves n=16 (W); take 4, leaves n=13 (W). So, n=17 is L? Because all options leave opponent in W? No, wait, no. Wait, wait, if n=17, current player can take 1, leaving n=16 (W), so opponent can win. Or take 4, leaving n=13 (W). So, opponent can win either way. So, n=17 is L.

n=18: take 1, leaves n=17 (L). So, opponent is in L, so n=18 is W.

n=19: take 1, leaves n=18 (W); take 4, leaves n=15 (L). So, taking 4 leaves opponent in L, so n=19 is W.

n=20: take 1, leaves n=19 (W); take 4, leaves n=16 (W). So, n=20 is L.

Yes, so the pattern holds: every multiple of 5 is a losing position.

Wait, but let's make sure. Let's see n=5: L, n=10: L, n=15: L, n=20: L.

So, the losing positions are n=5k, where k is a positive integer. So, for these n, the current player cannot force a win. So, if n is a multiple of 5, it's a losing position.

Therefore, if the starting position is a multiple of 5, the first player (Alice) cannot force a win, so Bob can win. So, the number of n ≤2024 where n is a multiple of 5 is the number of such n.

So, number of multiples of 5 from 1 to 2024 inclusive.

The number of multiples of 5 ≤2024 is floor(2024/5).

Calculating 2024 ÷5:

5×404=2020, so 404×5=2020. 2024-2020=4, so floor(2024/5)=404.

But wait, wait: n=0 is a losing position, but n=0 isn't in our range (positive integers). So, the multiples start at n=5,10,...2020.

Number of terms: from 5×1=5 to 5×404=2020. So, 404 terms.

Wait, but wait another thing: n must be a positive integer. So, n=5,10,...2020. 404 numbers.

So, the answer is 404.

But wait, let me double-check my initial analysis because sometimes the patterns can be more complex.

Wait, let's make sure that every multiple of 5 is a losing position.

At n=5, as we saw, the player can take 1, leaving n=4 (W), or take 4, leaving n=1 (W). So, both moves leave the opponent in a winning position, so n=5 is L.

Similarly, n=10: taking 1 leaves n=9 (W), taking 4 leaves n=6 (W). So, n=10 is L.

Similarly, n=15: taking 1 leaves n=14 (W), taking 4 leaves n=11 (W). So, n=15 is L.

So, yes, seems correct.

Another way to think: the losing positions are those where n ≡0 mod5.

So, the number of such n ≤2024 is floor(2024/5)=404.

So, the answer is 404.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The problem involves determining the number of positive integers \( n \leq 2024 \) for which Bob can guarantee a win regardless of Alice's moves. By analyzing the game, we identify that positions where \( n \) is a multiple of 5 are losing positions. Thus, there are 404 such numbers up to 2024.

The final answer is \(\boxed{404}\).
