Okay, so I'm trying to solve this geometry problem about triangle ABC. The problem states that the circumcenter is O and the incenter is I. It also says that IA is perpendicular to OI, the circumradius is 13, and the inradius is 6. I need to find the product AB·AC.

Hmm, let me recall some properties of circumcenters and incenters. The circumradius R is given as 13, so that's the radius of the circumscribed circle around triangle ABC. The inradius r is 6, which is the radius of the inscribed circle.

Since IA is perpendicular to OI, that must form a right angle where they meet. Maybe I can use some coordinate geometry here. Let me try setting up a coordinate system with point I at the origin to simplify things. Wait, but then O would be somewhere else, and IA would be a line from I to A, and OI would be the line from O to I. Since IA is perpendicular to OI, their dot product should be zero if I use coordinates.

Wait, maybe it's better to place the incenter I at the origin (0,0). Then the circumcenter O would be somewhere else, say (h, k). Point A is a vertex of the triangle, so its coordinates would be (x, y). Since IA is perpendicular to OI, the vector IA, which is (x, y), should be perpendicular to the vector OI, which is (h, k). So their dot product should be zero.

So, x*h + y*k = 0. That's one equation. But I'm not sure if that's the best way to model this. Maybe there's a better approach without coordinates.

Alternatively, I remember that in a triangle, the distance between the incenter and circumcenter is given by the formula OI² = R(R - 2r), where R is the circumradius and r is the inradius. Let me check that formula. Oh right, that's a known formula. So OI² = R² - 2Rr.

Given R = 13 and r = 6, so OI² = 13² - 2*13*6. Let me compute that:

13² is 169, and 2*13*6 is 156. So 169 - 156 = 13. So OI² = 13, so OI = sqrt(13).

Wait, but in the problem, IA is perpendicular to OI. So in triangle IOA, we have a right angle at I. So triangle IOA is right-angled at I.

So by the Pythagorean theorem, OA² = IO² + IA². But OA is the circumradius, which is 13. So 13² = (sqrt(13))² + IA². Let me compute that:

13² = 169, (sqrt(13))² is 13, so 169 = 13 + IA². Then IA² = 169 - 13 = 156. So IA is sqrt(156), which simplifies to 2*sqrt(39).

Wait, IA is the length from the inradius to vertex A. The inradius is 6, but IA is the distance from incenter I to vertex A. Hmm, is there a formula that relates IA to other triangle quantities?

Yes, I think the formula for the length of the inradius to a vertex is IA = r / sin(A/2), where r is the inradius and A is the angle at vertex A. Let me confirm that. I think that's correct because in the triangle formed by the inradius and angle bisector, IA can be expressed in terms of r and the half-angle.

So, IA = r / sin(A/2). So we have IA = sqrt(156) = 12.49 (but we'll keep it exact). So, sqrt(156) = 6 / sin(A/2). Let me solve for sin(A/2):

sin(A/2) = 6 / sqrt(156). Let me simplify sqrt(156). 156 factors into 4 * 39, so sqrt(156) is 2*sqrt(39). So sin(A/2) = 6 / (2*sqrt(39)) = 3 / sqrt(39) = (3*sqrt(39)) / 39 = sqrt(39)/13. Because 3/sqrt(39) is the same as sqrt(39)/13 after rationalizing the denominator.

So sin(A/2) = sqrt(39)/13. Therefore, cos(A/2) can be found using the identity sin²x + cos²x = 1.

So cos²(A/2) = 1 - (39)/(169) = (169 - 39)/169 = 130/169. So cos(A/2) = sqrt(130)/13.

Wait, but in a triangle, the product AB·AC can be expressed in terms of other variables. Let me think. AB and AC are the sides adjacent to angle A. Let's denote AB = c, AC = b, as per standard notation (opposite to angles B and C).

Wait, no, actually, standard notation is a = BC, b = AC, c = AB, with angles A, B, C opposite those sides respectively.

So, AB = c, AC = b. We need to find b·c.

I remember that in a triangle, the area can be expressed in terms of inradius and semiperimeter: area = r*s, where s is the semiperimeter.

Also, the area can be expressed as (1/2)*ab*sin C, but maybe that's not directly helpful here.

Wait, another formula for the area is (a*b*c)/(4R), where R is the circumradius. So area = (a*b*c)/(4*13) = (a*b*c)/52.

Wait, but I'm not sure if that's directly helpful. Maybe I should find expressions involving angles.

Alternatively, I remember that in a triangle, the length from the inradius to a vertex can be expressed as IA = (r)/sin(A/2). Which I already used.

But perhaps I can find cos A using the double angle formula. Since I have sin(A/2) and cos(A/2), I can find sin A and cos A.

So, sin A = 2 sin(A/2) cos(A/2) = 2*(sqrt(39)/13)*(sqrt(130)/13) = 2*sqrt(39*130)/(13*13).

Let me compute 39*130: 39 * 130 = 39 * 13 * 10 = (507) *10 = 5070. So sqrt(5070). Wait, but 5070 can be factored. Let me see: 5070 = 10 * 507 = 10 * 3 * 169 = 10 * 3 * 13². So sqrt(5070) = sqrt(10 * 3 * 13²) = 13 * sqrt(30).

So sin A = 2 * (13 * sqrt(30)) / (13²) ) = 2 * sqrt(30) / 13.

So sin A = (2 sqrt(30))/13. Then, cos A can be found using sin² A + cos² A =1.

So cos² A = 1 - (4*30)/(169) = 1 - 120/169 = (169 -120)/169 = 49/169. So cos A = 7/13 or -7/13. But since angle A is in a triangle, it's between 0 and 180 degrees, so cos A could be positive or negative depending on whether angle A is acute or obtuse.

Wait, but let's see. If IA is perpendicular to OI, and O is the circumradius, then maybe angle A is acute? I'm not sure, but let me proceed.

We'll assume cos A = 7/13 for now, but I might need to check later.

Now, in triangle ABC, using the Law of Cosines, we have:

a² = b² + c² - 2bc cos A.

But I don't know a, b, or c, so maybe that's not helpful yet.

Wait, but the area of the triangle can be expressed in terms of the inradius and semiperimeter: area = r*s, where s = (a+b+c)/2.

Also, the area can be expressed as (1/2)*b*c*sin A. From earlier, we found sin A = (2 sqrt(30))/13.

So area = (1/2)*b*c*(2 sqrt(30)/13) = (b c sqrt(30))/13.

Also, area = r*s = 6*s.

So, 6*s = (b c sqrt(30))/13.

So, 6s = (b c sqrt(30))/13. Let me write that as equation (1).

Also, the semiperimeter s = (a + b + c)/2.

Another formula relates the circumradius R and the sides: a/(sin A) = 2R. So a = 2R sin A. Since R=13, a = 2*13*(2 sqrt(30)/13) = 26*(2 sqrt(30)/13) = 4 sqrt(30).

Wait, wait, let me double-check that. a = 2R sin A = 2*13*(2 sqrt(30)/13) = 26*(2 sqrt(30)/13) = (26/13)*2 sqrt(30) = 2*2 sqrt(30) = 4 sqrt(30). So a = 4 sqrt(30).

So side BC (a) is 4 sqrt(30). Now, knowing a, let's try to relate it to other variables.

We have a² = (4 sqrt(30))² = 16 * 30 = 480.

From the Law of Cosines: a² = b² + c² - 2bc cos A.

We know a² = 480, cos A = 7/13, so 480 = b² + c² - 2bc*(7/13).

Hmm, that's one equation involving b and c. Let me write it as:

b² + c² - (14/13) bc = 480. Let me call this equation (2).

We also have from equation (1): 6s = (b c sqrt(30))/13.

But s = (a + b + c)/2 = (4 sqrt(30) + b + c)/2.

So, 6*(4 sqrt(30) + b + c)/2 = (b c sqrt(30))/13.

Simplify left side: 6*( (4 sqrt(30) + b + c)/2 ) = 3*(4 sqrt(30) + b + c) = 12 sqrt(30) + 3b + 3c.

So, 12 sqrt(30) + 3b + 3c = (b c sqrt(30))/13.

Let me write that as:

(b c sqrt(30))/13 - 3b - 3c = 12 sqrt(30).

Hmm, this seems a bit complicated. Maybe I can introduce some substitution. Let me set x = b and y = c. Then, equation (2) becomes:

x² + y² - (14/13) xy = 480.

And equation from area:

( x y sqrt(30) ) /13 - 3x - 3y = 12 sqrt(30).

This system looks a bit messy, but perhaps I can find another approach.

Wait, maybe I can express x + y and x y in terms of s.

Let me denote x + y = p and x y = q.

Then, equation (2): x² + y² - (14/13) xy = 480.

But x² + y² = (x + y)^2 - 2xy = p² - 2q.

So, substituting into equation (2):

p² - 2q - (14/13) q = 480.

Which becomes p² - (2 + 14/13) q = 480.

2 + 14/13 = (26 +14)/13 = 40/13.

So, p² - (40/13) q = 480. Let me call this equation (2a).

From the area equation, equation (1):

6*(4 sqrt(30) + p)/2 = (q sqrt(30))/13.

Simplify: 3*(4 sqrt(30) + p) = (q sqrt(30))/13.

Multiply both sides by 13: 39*(4 sqrt(30) + p) = q sqrt(30).

So, q = [39*(4 sqrt(30) + p)] / sqrt(30).

Let me rationalize the denominator:

sqrt(30) is in the denominator, so multiply numerator and denominator by sqrt(30):

q = [39*(4 sqrt(30) + p) * sqrt(30)] / 30.

Simplify numerator:

39*sqrt(30)*(4 sqrt(30) + p) = 39*(4*30 + p sqrt(30)) = 39*(120 + p sqrt(30)).

So, q = [39*(120 + p sqrt(30))]/30.

Simplify this fraction by dividing numerator and denominator by 3:

39 ÷ 3 =13, 30 ÷3=10.

So, q = [13*(120 + p sqrt(30))]/10 = (1560 +13 p sqrt(30))/10.

Hmm, this is getting complicated. Maybe I should find another way.

Wait, another formula: In any triangle, the product of a side and the corresponding inradius is related to the area. Wait, perhaps I can find another relation.

Wait, the formula for IA is IA = sqrt(r^2 + (s - a)^2), where s is the semiperimeter. Wait, is that correct?

Wait, let me think. The distance from the inradius to a vertex can be expressed in terms of the inradius, semiperimeter, and the sides. I think the formula is IA = sqrt(r^2 + (s - a)^2). Let me check: yes, I recall that the length from the inradius to vertex A is given by IA = sqrt( r^2 + (s - a)^2 ), where s is the semiperimeter.

So, IA = sqrt(r² + (s - a)^2).

We have IA = sqrt(156), r =6, so:

sqrt(156) = sqrt(6² + (s - a)^2) = sqrt(36 + (s - a)^2).

So, squaring both sides: 156 = 36 + (s - a)^2.

So, (s - a)^2 = 156 -36 = 120. So, s - a = sqrt(120) = 2*sqrt(30).

But s = (a + b + c)/2, so s - a = (b + c - a)/2.

We know a =4 sqrt(30), so:

(b + c -4 sqrt(30))/2 = 2 sqrt(30).

Multiply both sides by 2:

b + c -4 sqrt(30) =4 sqrt(30).

So, b + c = 8 sqrt(30). So, p = b + c =8 sqrt(30).

Now, that's a useful piece of information. So, p =8 sqrt(30).

Now, going back to equation (2a):

p² - (40/13) q =480.

We can plug p=8 sqrt(30) into this.

First, compute p²:

(8 sqrt(30))² =64 *30=1920.

So, equation becomes:

1920 - (40/13) q =480.

Subtract 480 from both sides:

1920 -480 = (40/13) q.

1440 = (40/13) q.

Multiply both sides by 13/40:

q =1440 * (13/40).

Simplify:

1440 ÷40=36. 36 *13=468.

So, q=468.

But q is b*c, so bc=468.

So, the product AB·AC is bc=468.

Wait, that's the answer? Let me verify all steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake.

We found that IA = sqrt(156), which came from the right triangle IOA where OA=13, OI=sqrt(13), so IA²=13² - (sqrt(13))² =169-13=156.

Then, using IA = sqrt(r² + (s -a)^2), we set sqrt(156)=sqrt(36 + (s-a)^2), so (s -a)^2=120, so s -a=2 sqrt(30). Then, since s=(a+b+c)/2, s -a=(b +c -a)/2, which led to b +c= 8 sqrt(30).

Then, using the area expressions, we found bc=468.

Yes, that seems correct. So the product AB·AC is 468.

To solve the problem, we start by noting that the circumradius \( R = 13 \) and the inradius \( r = 6 \). The distance between the circumcenter \( O \) and the incenter \( I \) is given by the formula \( OI^2 = R(R - 2r) \). Substituting the given values:

\[
OI^2 = 13^2 - 2 \cdot 13 \cdot 6 = 169 - 156 = 13 \quad \Rightarrow \quad OI = \sqrt{13}.
\]

Since \( \overline{IA} \perp \overline{OI} \), triangle \( IOA \) is right-angled at \( I \). By the Pythagorean theorem:

\[
OA^2 = OI^2 + IA^2 \quad \Rightarrow \quad 13^2 = (\sqrt{13})^2 + IA^2 \quad \Rightarrow \quad IA^2 = 169 - 13 = 156 \quad \Rightarrow \quad IA = \sqrt{156}.
\]

The length \( IA \) can be expressed as \( IA = \frac{r}{\sin(A/2)} \). Substituting \( r = 6 \) and \( IA = \sqrt{156} \):

\[
\sqrt{156} = \frac{6}{\sin(A/2)} \quad \Rightarrow \quad \sin(A/2) = \frac{6}{\sqrt{156}} = \frac{\sqrt{39}}{13}.
\]

Using the identity \( \cos^2(A/2) = 1 - \sin^2(A/2) \):

\[
\cos^2(A/2) = 1 - \left(\frac{\sqrt{39}}{13}\right)^2 = \frac{49}{169} \quad \Rightarrow \quad \cos(A/2) = \frac{7}{13}.
\]

The angle \( A \) can be found using the double-angle formulas:

\[
\sin A = 2 \sin(A/2) \cos(A/2) = 2 \cdot \frac{\sqrt{39}}{13} \cdot \frac{7}{13} = \frac{2\sqrt{30}}{13},
\]
\[
\cos A = 1 - 2\sin^2(A/2) = 1 - 2 \cdot \frac{39}{169} = \frac{49}{169} \quad \Rightarrow \quad \cos A = \frac{7}{13}.
\]

Using the Law of Cosines for side \( a \) (opposite angle \( A \)):

\[
a^2 = b^2 + c^2 - 2bc \cos A.
\]

The semiperimeter \( s \) is given by \( s = \frac{a + b + c}{2} \). The area of the triangle can be expressed as \( \text{Area} = r \cdot s = 6s \) and also as \( \text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} bc \sin A \). Equating these:

\[
6s = \frac{1}{2} bc \cdot \frac{2\sqrt{30}}{13} \quad \Rightarrow \quad 6s = \frac{bc \sqrt{30}}{13}.
\]

The length \( a \) can be found using the circumradius formula \( a = 2R \sin A \):

\[
a = 2 \cdot 13 \cdot \frac{2\sqrt{30}}{13} = 4\sqrt{30}.
\]

Using \( a = 4\sqrt{30} \) and the semiperimeter \( s \), we find:

\[
s - a = \frac{b + c - a}{2} = \frac{b + c - 4\sqrt{30}}{2}.
\]

From the formula \( IA = \sqrt{r^2 + (s - a)^2} \):

\[
\sqrt{156} = \sqrt{6^2 + (s - a)^2} \quad \Rightarrow \quad (s - a)^2 = 120 \quad \Rightarrow \quad s - a = 2\sqrt{30}.
\]

This gives:

\[
\frac{b + c - 4\sqrt{30}}{2} = 2\sqrt{30} \quad \Rightarrow \quad b + c = 8\sqrt{30}.
\]

Finally, using the area equation and solving for \( bc \):

\[
6 \cdot \frac{8\sqrt{30} + 4\sqrt{30}}{2} = \frac{bc \sqrt{30}}{13} \quad \Rightarrow \quad bc = 468.
\]

Thus, the product \( AB \cdot AC = bc = 468 \).

\[
\boxed{468}
\]
