Okay, so I've got this problem here with three variables x, y, and z, all positive real numbers. They satisfy a system of three logarithmic equations, and I need to find the absolute value of log base 2 of (x^4 y^3 z^2), then express it as a fraction m/n where m and n are coprime, and then find m + n. 

Let me write down the equations first to get a clear picture.

The equations are:
1. log₂(x / (y z)) = 1/2
2. log₂(y / (x z)) = 1/3
3. log₂(z / (x y)) = 1/4

Hmm, logarithms can sometimes be tricky, but I remember that log_b(a) = c is equivalent to b^c = a. So maybe I can rewrite these equations in exponential form to make them easier to handle.

Starting with the first equation:
log₂(x / (y z)) = 1/2
This means 2^(1/2) = x / (y z). So, sqrt(2) = x / (y z). Let me write that as equation (1a):
x = y z sqrt(2)  --> (1a)

Similarly, the second equation:
log₂(y / (x z)) = 1/3
So, 2^(1/3) = y / (x z). Let me write that as equation (2a):
y = x z * 2^(1/3)  --> (2a)

Third equation:
log₂(z / (x y)) = 1/4
Which means 2^(1/4) = z / (x y). Equation (3a):
z = x y * 2^(1/4)  --> (3a)

Now, I have three equations (1a, 2a, 3a) that relate x, y, z. My goal is to find log₂(x^4 y^3 z^2). Let me denote that expression as E for simplicity.

E = log₂(x^4 y^3 z^2) = 4 log₂ x + 3 log₂ y + 2 log₂ z

But maybe it's easier to express everything in terms of logarithms. Let me define:
Let a = log₂ x
Let b = log₂ y
Let c = log₂ z

So, E = 4a + 3b + 2c

Now, I need to find a, b, c.

Looking back at the three original equations, let's take the logarithm base 2 of both sides of each equation (1a, 2a, 3a) because logarithms can help linearize the multiplicative relationships.

Starting with equation (1a):
x = y z sqrt(2)
Taking log₂ of both sides:
log₂ x = log₂ (y z sqrt(2)) = log₂ y + log₂ z + log₂ sqrt(2)
Which simplifies to:
a = b + c + (1/2)   --> because log₂ sqrt(2) is log₂ 2^(1/2) = 1/2

Similarly, equation (2a):
y = x z * 2^(1/3)
Taking log₂:
log₂ y = log₂ x + log₂ z + log₂ 2^(1/3)
Which simplifies to:
b = a + c + (1/3)

Equation (3a):
z = x y * 2^(1/4)
Taking log₂:
log₂ z = log₂ x + log₂ y + log₂ 2^(1/4)
Which simplifies to:
c = a + b + (1/4)

So now I have a system of three equations with a, b, c:
1. a = b + c + 1/2   --> Equation (1b)
2. b = a + c + 1/3   --> Equation (2b)
3. c = a + b + 1/4   --> Equation (3b)

Hmm, this is a linear system. Let me write them down clearly:

Equation (1b): a = b + c + 1/2
Equation (2b): b = a + c + 1/3
Equation (3b): c = a + b + 1/4

I can try to solve for a, b, c using substitution or elimination. Let's try substitution.

From equation (1b): a = b + c + 1/2 --> Let's substitute a in equations (2b) and (3b).

Substituting a into equation (2b):
b = (b + c + 1/2) + c + 1/3
Simplify:
b = b + c + 1/2 + c + 1/3
b = b + 2c + 5/6  (since 1/2 + 1/3 = 3/6 + 2/6 = 5/6)

Subtract b from both sides:
0 = 2c + 5/6
So, 2c = -5/6
c = -5/12

Wait, c is log₂ z, and since z is a positive real number, c can be negative. That's fine.

Now, from equation (1b): a = b + c + 1/2
We can write a = b + (-5/12) + 1/2
Which is a = b - 5/12 + 6/12 = b + 1/12

So, a = b + 1/12 --> Equation (4)

Now, let's substitute a into equation (3b):
c = a + b + 1/4
We know c = -5/12, so:
-5/12 = a + b + 1/4

But from equation (4): a = b + 1/12, substitute into above:

-5/12 = (b + 1/12) + b + 1/4
Simplify:
-5/12 = 2b + 1/12 + 3/12 (since 1/4 is 3/12)
Wait, 1/4 is 3/12, so:

-5/12 = 2b + (1/12 + 3/12) = 2b + 4/12 = 2b + 1/3

So, 2b = -5/12 - 4/12 = -9/12 = -3/4

Thus, b = (-3/4) / 2 = -3/8

Now, from equation (4): a = b + 1/12 = (-3/8) + 1/12

Convert to common denominator, which is 24:
-3/8 = -9/24
1/12 = 2/24
So, a = (-9/24) + (2/24) = (-7)/24

So, a = -7/24, b = -3/8, c = -5/12

Now, let me write down the values:

a = log₂ x = -7/24
b = log₂ y = -3/8
c = log₂ z = -5/12

But let's check if these values satisfy all three equations (1b, 2b, 3b):

Equation (1b): a = b + c + 1/2
Left side: a = -7/24
Right side: b + c + 1/2 = (-3/8) + (-5/12) + 1/2

Convert to 24 denominator:

-3/8 = -9/24
-5/12 = -10/24
1/2 = 12/24

So, right side: (-9 -10 +12)/24 = (-7)/24 --> which equals a. Okay, that checks out.

Equation (2b): b = a + c + 1/3
Left side: b = -3/8
Right side: a + c + 1/3 = (-7/24) + (-5/12) + 1/3

Convert to 24 denominator:

a = -7/24
c = -5/12 = -10/24
1/3 = 8/24

So, right side: (-7 -10 +8)/24 = (-9)/24 = -3/8, which equals b. Good.

Equation (3b): c = a + b + 1/4
Left side: c = -5/12
Right side: a + b +1/4 = (-7/24) + (-3/8) +1/4

Convert to 24 denominator:

a = -7/24
b = -3/8 = -9/24
1/4 = 6/24

So, right side: (-7 -9 +6)/24 = (-10)/24 = -5/12, which is equal to c. Perfect.

So the values of a, b, c are correct.

Now, our target is E = 4a + 3b + 2c.

Substituting the values:

E = 4*(-7/24) + 3*(-3/8) + 2*(-5/12)

Let me compute each term:

4*(-7/24) = (-28)/24 = (-7)/6
3*(-3/8) = (-9)/8
2*(-5/12) = (-10)/12 = (-5)/6

Now, E = (-7/6) + (-9/8) + (-5/6)

Combine terms:

First, combine (-7/6) and (-5/6): (-7 -5)/6 = (-12)/6 = -2

So, E = -2 + (-9/8) = -2 - 9/8

Convert -2 to eighths: -16/8

So, -16/8 -9/8 = (-25)/8

So, E = -25/8

But the problem asks for the absolute value of E, so |E| = | -25/8 | = 25/8

So, the value is 25/8. Now, 25 and 8 are coprime since their GCD is 1.

Thus, m =25, n=8, so m +n=33.

Wait, let me just double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any arithmetic errors.

Computing E:

4a =4*(-7/24)= -28/24= -7/6≈-1.1667
3b=3*(-3/8)= -9/8≈-1.125
2c=2*(-5/12)= -10/12= -5/6≈-0.8333

Adding them: -7/6 -9/8 -5/6

First, combine -7/6 and -5/6: (-7 -5)/6= -12/6= -2

Then, -2 -9/8

Convert -2 to eighths: -16/8

-16/8 -9/8= -25/8

Yes, that seems correct.

So, the absolute value is 25/8. Therefore, m=25, n=8, so m +n=33.

To solve the problem, we start by converting the given logarithmic equations into exponential form:

1. \(\log_2\left(\frac{x}{yz}\right) = \frac{1}{2}\) implies \(x = yz \cdot 2^{1/2}\).
2. \(\log_2\left(\frac{y}{xz}\right) = \frac{1}{3}\) implies \(y = xz \cdot 2^{1/3}\).
3. \(\log_2\left(\frac{z}{xy}\right) = \frac{1}{4}\) implies \(z = xy \cdot 2^{1/4}\).

Next, we take the logarithm base 2 of each equation to linearize the system:

1. \(\log_2 x = \log_2 y + \log_2 z + \frac{1}{2}\)
2. \(\log_2 y = \log_2 x + \log_2 z + \frac{1}{3}\)
3. \(\log_2 z = \log_2 x + \log_2 y + \frac{1}{4}\)

Let \(a = \log_2 x\), \(b = \log_2 y\), and \(c = \log_2 z\). This gives us the system:

1. \(a = b + c + \frac{1}{2}\)
2. \(b = a + c + \frac{1}{3}\)
3. \(c = a + b + \frac{1}{4}\)

Solving this system, we find:
- \(a = -\frac{7}{24}\)
- \(b = -\frac{3}{8}\)
- \(c = -\frac{5}{12}\)

We then compute \(E = 4a + 3b + 2c\):
\[
E = 4\left(-\frac{7}{24}\right) + 3\left(-\frac{3}{8}\right) + 2\left(-\frac{5}{12}\right) = -\frac{7}{6} - \frac{9}{8} - \frac{5}{6} = -\frac{25}{8}
\]

Taking the absolute value, we get \(\left|-\frac{25}{8}\right| = \frac{25}{8}\). Thus, \(m = 25\) and \(n = 8\), leading to \(m + n = 33\).

The final answer is \(\boxed{33}\).
