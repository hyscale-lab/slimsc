Okay, so I have this problem here. I need to find the number of triples of nonnegative integers (a, b, c) that satisfy two conditions: first, a + b + c = 300, and second, a²b + a²c + b²a + b²c + c²a + c²b = 6,000,000. Hmm, this looks a bit complicated, but let me try breaking it down.

First, let me write down what I know. The variables a, b, c are nonnegative integers, so they can be 0 or any positive integer. The first equation is linear, and the second one is quadratic in each variable but with cross terms.

I remember that sometimes when dealing with symmetric equations, it's helpful to look for symmetry in the variables. So let me see if I can rewrite the second equation in a more manageable form. Looking at the second equation: a²b + a²c + b²a + b²c + c²a + c²b. I notice that each term is a product of two variables where one is squared. So, perhaps I can factor this expression.

Let me try factoring. Let's group the terms as follows:

a²b + a²c = a²(b + c)
Similarly, b²a + b²c = b²(a + c)
And c²a + c²b = c²(a + b)

So the entire expression becomes:
a²(b + c) + b²(a + c) + c²(a + b).

Hmm, that looks a bit better. Now, since a + b + c = 300, I can express (b + c) as 300 - a, right? Because a + b + c = 300 implies that b + c = 300 - a. Similarly, (a + c) = 300 - b and (a + b) = 300 - c.

So substituting that into the expression, I get:
a²(300 - a) + b²(300 - b) + c²(300 - c).

So now the second equation is:
a²(300 - a) + b²(300 - b) + c²(300 - c) = 6,000,000.

Hmm, that's better. So each term is of the form x²(300 - x) where x is a variable. Let me write that as:

300a² - a³ + 300b² - b³ + 300c² - c³ = 6,000,000.

So, 300(a² + b² + c²) - (a³ + b³ + c³) = 6,000,000.

I can write this as:
300(a² + b² + c²) - (a³ + b³ + c³) = 6,000,000.

Hmm, maybe I can find a relationship between a² + b² + c² and a³ + b³ + c³. Let me think.

I know that for any number x, x³ = x² * x. So, perhaps I can relate these terms through some identity or inequality. Alternatively, maybe I can express a³ + b³ + c³ in terms of a + b + c and a² + b² + c².

Wait, I remember that a³ + b³ + c³ can be expressed using the formula:

a³ + b³ + c³ = (a + b + c)³ - 3(a + b + c)(ab + bc + ca) + 3abc.

But I'm not sure if that's helpful here. Let me compute that.

Given that a + b + c = 300, let me denote S = a + b + c = 300.

Then, a³ + b³ + c³ = S³ - 3S(ab + bc + ca) + 3abc.

So plugging that into our equation:

300(a² + b² + c²) - [S³ - 3S(ab + bc + ca) + 3abc] = 6,000,000.

Let me compute each part. First, S is 300, so S³ = 300³ = 27,000,000.

So, the equation becomes:

300(a² + b² + c²) - [27,000,000 - 3*300(ab + bc + ca) + 3abc] = 6,000,000.

Let me distribute the negative sign:

300(a² + b² + c²) -27,000,000 + 900(ab + bc + ca) - 3abc = 6,000,000.

Now, let's bring all constants to one side:

300(a² + b² + c²) + 900(ab + bc + ca) - 3abc = 6,000,000 + 27,000,000.

Compute the right-hand side: 6,000,000 + 27,000,000 = 33,000,000.

So now equation is:

300(a² + b² + c²) + 900(ab + bc + ca) - 3abc = 33,000,000.

Hmm, that's a bit messy, but perhaps I can factor out some common terms. Let me see.

Looking at the coefficients, 300, 900, and 3. I notice that 300 is 3*100, 900 is 9*100, and 3 is 3. So perhaps I can factor out 3:

3[100(a² + b² + c²) + 300(ab + bc + ca) - abc] = 33,000,000.

Divide both sides by 3:

100(a² + b² + c²) + 300(ab + bc + ca) - abc = 11,000,000.

Hmm, that's still complicated. Let me think if there's another approach.

Wait, maybe instead of trying to express everything in terms of a, b, c, I can consider the symmetry. Since the problem is symmetric in a, b, c, perhaps the solutions are symmetric as well. So maybe some of the variables are equal.

Alternatively, maybe I can consider cases where one or two variables are zero.

Wait, but the variables are nonnegative, so they can be zero. Let me consider different cases.

Case 1: All variables are positive, i.e., a, b, c ≥ 1.

Case 2: Exactly one variable is zero. So, for example, a = 0, and b, c > 0.

Case 3: Exactly two variables are zero. For example, a = b = 0, c > 0.

Case 4: All three variables are zero. But since a + b + c = 300, this case is impossible because 0 + 0 + 0 ≠ 300.

So I can ignore Case 4.

Let me tackle Case 3 first because it's the simplest.

Case 3: Two variables are zero. Let's say a = b = 0, then c = 300.

Now, check if this satisfies the second equation.

Compute a²b + a²c + b²a + b²c + c²a + c²b.

Plugging a = b = 0, c = 300:

0²*0 + 0²*300 + 0²*0 + 0²*300 + 300²*0 + 300²*0 = 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 = 0.

But the required value is 6,000,000, so this case doesn't work. Similarly, any two variables being zero will result in the second expression being zero, which doesn't meet the required value. So Case 3 gives no solutions.

Case 2: Exactly one variable is zero. Let's suppose c = 0, and a, b > 0.

Then, the first equation becomes a + b = 300.

The second equation becomes a²b + a²*0 + b²a + b²*0 + 0²*a + 0²*b = a²b + b²a.

So, a²b + b²a = ab(a + b) = ab*300.

So, ab*300 = 6,000,000.

Divide both sides by 300: ab = 6,000,000 / 300 = 20,000.

So, ab = 20,000, with a + b = 300.

So, we have a + b = 300 and ab = 20,000.

This is a system of equations in a and b. Let me write it as:

a + b = 300,
ab = 20,000.

This is similar to solving a quadratic equation. Let me let x = a, then b = 300 - x.

So, x(300 - x) = 20,000.

Expanding: 300x - x² = 20,000.

Rearranging: x² - 300x + 20,000 = 0.

Now, solve for x using quadratic formula:

x = [300 ± sqrt(300² - 4*1*20,000)] / 2.

Compute discriminant D: 90,000 - 80,000 = 10,000.

So, sqrt(D) = 100.

Thus, x = (300 ± 100)/2.

Compute both roots:

x = (300 + 100)/2 = 400/2 = 200,

x = (300 - 100)/2 = 200/2 = 100.

So, solutions are x = 200 and x = 100.

Thus, when c = 0, the possible (a, b) are (200, 100) and (100, 200).

Since a and b are positive integers, these are valid solutions.

But in this case, c is zero, so each of these gives a valid triple: (200, 100, 0) and (100, 200, 0).

But since the variables are ordered, we also need to consider when a = 0 or b = 0.

Wait, hold on. In Case 2, we considered c = 0. But the case could also be a = 0 or b = 0. So, let's do that.

Subcase 2a: a = 0, then b + c = 300, and the second equation becomes 0 + 0 + b²*0 + b²c + c²*0 + c²*0 = b²c + c²b = bc(b + c) = bc*300.

Set equal to 6,000,000.

So, bc*300 = 6,000,000 → bc = 20,000.

Same as before, so we have b + c = 300, bc = 20,000.

Which gives the same solutions: b = 200, c = 100; or b = 100, c = 200.

Thus, the triples are (0, 200, 100) and (0, 100, 200).

Similarly, Subcase 2b: b = 0. Then a + c = 300, and the second equation becomes a²*0 + a²c + 0 + 0 + c²a + 0 = a²c + c²a = ac(a + c) = ac*300.

Set equal to 6,000,000: ac*300 = 6,000,000 → ac = 20,000.

Again, same as before, leading to a = 200, c = 100 or a = 100, c = 200.

So the triples are (200, 0, 100) and (100, 0, 200).

So in total, for Case 2, we have 6 triples:

From c=0: (200,100,0), (100,200,0)

From a=0: (0,200,100), (0,100,200)

From b=0: (200,0,100), (100,0,200)

Wait, that's 6 triples.

Wait, but each of these is unique because the order matters.

Wait, but in each subcase, we had 2 solutions, and there are 3 subcases (a=0, b=0, c=0), each giving 2 triples, so 3*2=6.

So, 6 solutions from Case 2.

Now, let's consider Case 1: all variables positive (a, b, c ≥ 1).

So, a + b + c = 300, and a²b + a²c + b²a + b²c + c²a + c²b = 6,000,000.

Hmm, this is more complicated. Let me think if I can find a way to relate this to the first equation.

Wait, earlier I had:

300(a² + b² + c²) + 900(ab + bc + ca) - 3abc = 33,000,000.

Hmm, perhaps I can write this as:

300(a² + b² + c²) + 900(ab + bc + ca) - 3abc = 33,000,000.

I can factor 3:

3[100(a² + b² + c²) + 300(ab + bc + ca) - abc] = 33,000,000,

which simplifies to:

100(a² + b² + c²) + 300(ab + bc + ca) - abc = 11,000,000.

Hmm, that seems complicated, but maybe I can express a² + b² + c² in terms of (a + b + c)².

I know that (a + b + c)^2 = a² + b² + c² + 2(ab + bc + ca). So:

a² + b² + c² = (a + b + c)^2 - 2(ab + bc + ca) = 300² - 2(ab + bc + ca) = 90,000 - 2(ab + bc + ca).

Let me substitute this into the equation:

100*(90,000 - 2(ab + bc + ca)) + 300(ab + bc + ca) - abc = 11,000,000.

Compute 100*90,000 = 9,000,000.

100*(-2)(ab + bc + ca) = -200(ab + bc + ca).

So, the equation becomes:

9,000,000 - 200(ab + bc + ca) + 300(ab + bc + ca) - abc = 11,000,000.

Combine like terms:

-200(ab + bc + ca) + 300(ab + bc + ca) = 100(ab + bc + ca).

So, now the equation is:

9,000,000 + 100(ab + bc + ca) - abc = 11,000,000.

Subtract 9,000,000 from both sides:

100(ab + bc + ca) - abc = 2,000,000.

Hmm, that's better. So,

100(ab + bc + ca) - abc = 2,000,000.

Let me write this as:

abc - 100(ab + bc + ca) = -2,000,000.

Hmm, not sure if that helps. Alternatively, factor:

ab + bc + ca = (ab + bc + ca), and abc is the product.

Alternatively, maybe factor out ab:

ab(c) + bc(a) + ca(b) = ab(c + a + b) = ab*(300), since a + b + c = 300.

Wait, that's interesting. Let me compute ab + bc + ca.

Wait, ab + bc + ca = ab + bc + ca. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I can express the equation as:

100(ab + bc + ca) - abc = 2,000,000.

Let me let x = ab + bc + ca, y = abc.

Then the equation is:

100x - y = 2,000,000.

So, y = 100x - 2,000,000.

Hmm, but I also know from the equation a + b + c = 300, which is S = 300.

So, in symmetric polynomials, for three variables, we have:

S = a + b + c = 300,

P = ab + bc + ca = x,

Q = abc = y.

So, I have a cubic equation whose roots are a, b, c:

t³ - S t² + P t - Q = 0.

So, t³ - 300 t² + x t - y = 0.

But from earlier, we have y = 100x - 2,000,000.

So, the equation becomes:

t³ - 300 t² + x t - (100x - 2,000,000) = 0.

Simplify:

t³ - 300 t² + x t - 100x + 2,000,000 = 0.

Hmm, not sure if that helps. Alternatively, perhaps I can find another equation involving x and y.

Wait, another thought. Since a, b, c are positive integers, perhaps I can find bounds on a, b, c.

Given that a + b + c = 300, each of a, b, c is at most 300.

Also, the second equation is 6,000,000, so the variables can't be too small.

Wait, let me see:

Looking back at the expression a²b + a²c + b²a + b²c + c²a + c²b = 6,000,000.

Each term is a product of two variables where one is squared. So, for the product to be large, the variables must be relatively large.

Wait, but 300 is pretty large, so maybe the variables are spread out, but perhaps two of them are large, and one is small? Or maybe all three are similar.

Wait, maybe all variables are equal. Let me check.

Suppose a = b = c. Then a + b + c = 3a = 300, so a = 100.

So, a = b = c = 100.

Now compute the second equation:

a²b + a²c + b²a + b²c + c²a + c²b.

Each term is 100² * 100 = 1,000,000. There are six terms, so 6,000,000.

Which is exactly the value we need. So, (100, 100, 100) is a solution.

But in Case 1, all variables are positive, so that's valid.

So, that's one solution. But are there others?

Wait, but the problem is symmetric, so perhaps other triples where two variables are equal and the third is different? Or all variables different.

Wait, let me think. If a, b, c are all equal, that's one solution. What about if two are equal and the third is different?

Suppose a = b ≠ c. Then, 2a + c = 300 → c = 300 - 2a.

Compute the second equation:

a²b + a²c + b²a + b²c + c²a + c²b.

Since a = b, this becomes:

a²a + a²c + a²a + a²c + c²a + c²a.

Simplify:

a³ + a²c + a³ + a²c + 2c²a.

Which is 2a³ + 2a²c + 2a c².

Factor: 2a³ + 2a²c + 2a c² = 2a(a² + a c + c²).

Set equal to 6,000,000:

2a(a² + a c + c²) = 6,000,000.

Divide both sides by 2:

a(a² + a c + c²) = 3,000,000.

But c = 300 - 2a, so substitute:

a [ a² + a(300 - 2a) + (300 - 2a)^2 ] = 3,000,000.

Let me compute the expression inside the brackets:

a² + a(300 - 2a) + (300 - 2a)^2.

Compute each term:

a².

a(300 - 2a) = 300a - 2a².

(300 - 2a)^2 = 90,000 - 1,200a + 4a².

So, adding all together:

a² + (300a - 2a²) + (90,000 - 1,200a + 4a²).

Combine like terms:

a² - 2a² + 4a² = 3a².

300a - 1,200a = -900a.

And 90,000.

So, total is 3a² - 900a + 90,000.

So, the equation becomes:

a (3a² - 900a + 90,000) = 3,000,000.

Let me factor out 3 from the quadratic:

3a² - 900a + 90,000 = 3(a² - 300a + 30,000).

So, equation is:

a * 3(a² - 300a + 30,000) = 3,000,000.

Divide both sides by 3:

a(a² - 300a + 30,000) = 1,000,000.

So, we have:

a³ - 300a² + 30,000a - 1,000,000 = 0.

Hmm, solving this cubic equation for a. Let me see if I can find integer roots.

Possible rational roots are factors of 1,000,000 divided by factors of 1, so possible integer roots are divisors of 1,000,000.

Looking for a between 1 and 150, since c = 300 - 2a must be positive, so 300 - 2a > 0 → a < 150.

Let me test a = 100.

Compute 100³ - 300*(100)^2 + 30,000*100 - 1,000,000.

100³ = 1,000,000.

300*(100)^2 = 300*10,000=3,000,000.

30,000*100=3,000,000.

So,

1,000,000 - 3,000,000 + 3,000,000 - 1,000,000 = 0. Yes, a=100 is a root.

So, (a - 100) is a factor.

Let's perform polynomial division or factorization.

Divide a³ - 300a² + 30,000a - 1,000,000 by (a - 100).

Using synthetic division:

Coefficients: 1 | -300 | 30,000 | -1,000,000

Divide by a=100:

Bring down 1.

Multiply by 100: 1*100=100. Add to next coefficient: -300 + 100 = -200.

Multiply by 100: -200*100= -20,000. Add to next coefficient: 30,000 + (-20,000) = 10,000.

Multiply by 100: 10,000 *100=1,000,000. Add to last term: -1,000,000 + 1,000,000=0.

So, the cubic factors as (a - 100)(a² - 200a + 10,000) = 0.

So, roots are a=100, and solutions to a² -200a +10,000=0.

Solve a² -200a +10,000=0.

Discriminant D=40,000 -40,000=0.

So, a=(200)/2=100.

So, the only real roots are a=100 (double root).

So, the only solution is a=100.

Thus, when a = b = 100, c = 300 - 2a = 300 - 200 = 100.

So, this gives the triple (100,100,100), which we already found.

So, no other solutions when two variables are equal in Case 1.

Hmm, so maybe all variables must be equal in Case 1?

But wait, maybe not. Perhaps there are other triples where all three variables are different.

Let me think. Since the problem is symmetric, maybe the only solution in Case 1 is (100,100,100).

But I'm not entirely sure. Let me try plugging in some other numbers.

Suppose a = 150, b = 150, c =0. But wait, that's in Case 2, which we already covered.

Alternatively, a= 200, b=100, c=0, which is in Case 2.

But in Case 1, all variables are positive. So maybe (100,100,100) is the only solution in Case 1.

Wait, but let me test another point. Suppose a=200, b=50, c=50. Then a + b + c =300.

Compute the second equation:

a²b + a²c + b²a + b²c + c²a + c²b.

Compute each term:

200²*50 = 40,000*50=2,000,000.

200²*50= same as above, 2,000,000.

50²*200=2,500*200=500,000.

50²*50=2,500*50=125,000.

50²*200= same as above, 500,000.

50²*50= same as above, 125,000.

Wait, let me compute each term:

a²b = 200² *50=40,000*50=2,000,000.

a²c=200²*50= same as above, 2,000,000.

b²a=50²*200=2,500*200=500,000.

b²c=50²*50=2,500*50=125,000.

c²a=50²*200= same as b²a, 500,000.

c²b=50²*50= same as b²c, 125,000.

So sum all terms:

2,000,000 + 2,000,000 + 500,000 + 125,000 + 500,000 + 125,000.

Compute:

2,000,000 + 2,000,000 = 4,000,000.

500,000 + 500,000 = 1,000,000.

125,000 + 125,000 = 250,000.

Total: 4,000,000 + 1,000,000 + 250,000 = 5,250,000.

Which is less than 6,000,000. So, this triple doesn't satisfy the second equation.

Hmm, so perhaps the variables need to be arranged such that two are 100 and the third is 100, but that's the same as all being 100.

Alternatively, maybe we can have variables like 150, 150, 0, but that's Case 2.

Wait, let me try another approach.

Earlier, I had the equation:

100(ab + bc + ca) - abc = 2,000,000.

Let me denote ab + bc + ca = x, abc = y.

So, 100x - y = 2,000,000 → y = 100x - 2,000,000.

But also, from the theory of symmetric equations, for three variables a, b, c:

We have the cubic equation t^3 - 300t^2 + x t - y = 0.

Which, with y = 100x - 2e6, becomes:

t^3 - 300t^2 + x t - (100x - 2e6) = 0.

Simplify:

t^3 - 300t^2 + x t -100x + 2e6 = 0.

Hmm, perhaps I can factor this cubic.

Wait, maybe factor by grouping.

t^3 -300t^2 + x t -100x + 2e6.

Hmm, group terms as (t^3 - 300t^2) + (x t - 100x) + 2e6.

Factor:

t²(t - 300) + x(t - 100) + 2e6.

Hmm, not sure if that helps.

Alternatively, perhaps try to find a root.

Let me try t=100.

Plug into the equation: 100³ - 300*100² + x*100 -100x + 2e6.

Compute:

1,000,000 - 3,000,000 + 100x -100x + 2,000,000.

Simplify:

(1,000,000 - 3,000,000 + 2,000,000) + (100x -100x).

Which is 0 + 0 = 0.

So, t=100 is a root. So, the cubic can be factored as (t - 100)(some quadratic).

Let me perform polynomial division.

Divide t³ -300t² + x t -100x + 2e6 by (t - 100).

Using synthetic division:

Write coefficients: 1 | -300 | x | (-100x + 2e6).

Wait, but since x is a variable, this might complicate things. Alternatively, perhaps use algebraic division.

Divide t³ -300t² + x t -100x + 2,000,000 by (t - 100).

So, t³ divided by t is t². Multiply (t -100) by t²: t³ -100t².

Subtract this from the original polynomial:

(t³ -300t² + x t -100x + 2e6) - (t³ -100t²) = (-300t² +100t²) + x t -100x + 2e6 = (-200t²) + x t -100x + 2e6.

Next term: -200t² / t = -200t. Multiply (t - 100) by -200t: -200t² + 20,000t.

Subtract:

(-200t² +x t -100x + 2e6) - (-200t² +20,000t) = (x t -20,000t) -100x + 2e6.

Factor t: t(x - 20,000) -100x + 2e6.

Next term: [t(x - 20,000)] / t = (x - 20,000). Multiply (t - 100) by (x - 20,000): (t -100)(x -20,000) = t(x -20,000) -100(x -20,000).

Subtract:

[t(x -20,000) -100x +2e6] - [t(x -20,000) -100(x -20,000)] = (-100x +2e6) - [-100x + 2e6] = 0.

So, the division works, and the quadratic factor is -200t + (x -20,000).

Wait, so the cubic factors as (t -100)(t² -200t + x -20,000).

So, the equation becomes:

(t -100)(t² -200t + x -20,000) = 0.

So, the roots are t=100, and the roots of t² -200t + (x -20,000)=0.

But since a, b, c are positive integers, all roots must be positive integers, and they must sum to 300 (from S=300).

Wait, but the sum of the roots is 100 + [sum of roots of quadratic].

The sum of roots of quadratic is 200. So, total sum is 100 + 200 = 300. Which matches.

Similarly, the product of the roots is 100 * [product of quadratic roots].

But the product is abc = y =100x -2e6.

Hmm, maybe this line of thought isn't helping me much. Let me try another approach.

Since in Case 1, all variables are positive, and the only solution I found so far is (100,100,100), perhaps that's the only one.

But wait, perhaps not. Maybe other triples exist.

Wait, let's consider that in Case 1, a, b, c are all positive integers, and in addition to (100,100,100), perhaps there are other triples where a, b, c are different.

But given the symmetry, it's challenging. Let me see if I can find another triple.

Wait, perhaps a=150, b=100, c=50.

Check a + b + c = 150 + 100 +50=300.

Compute the second equation:

a²b + a²c + b²a + b²c + c²a + c²b.

Compute each term:

150²*100=22,500*100=2,250,000.

150²*50=22,500*50=1,125,000.

100²*150=10,000*150=1,500,000.

100²*50=10,000*50=500,000.

50²*150=2,500*150=375,000.

50²*100=2,500*100=250,000.

Now, sum all these:

2,250,000 + 1,125,000 = 3,375,000.

3,375,000 + 1,500,000 = 4,875,000.

4,875,000 + 500,000 = 5,375,000.

5,375,000 + 375,000 = 5,750,000.

5,750,000 + 250,000 = 6,000,000.

Oh! So, this triple (150,100,50) satisfies the second equation.

Wait, that's a valid solution. So, in Case 1, we have at least this triple.

Interesting. So, there are solutions where all variables are different.

Similarly, since the problem is symmetric, any permutation of (150,100,50) would also be a solution.

Let me check another permutation: (100,50,150).

Compute the second equation:

100²*50 + 100²*150 + 50²*100 + 50²*150 + 150²*100 + 150²*50.

Compute each term:

100²*50=10,000*50=500,000.

100²*150=10,000*150=1,500,000.

50²*100=2,500*100=250,000.

50²*150=2,500*150=375,000.

150²*100=22,500*100=2,250,000.

150²*50=22,500*50=1,125,000.

Sum them:

500,000 +1,500,000=2,000,000.

2,000,000 +250,000=2,250,000.

2,250,000 +375,000=2,625,000.

2,625,000 +2,250,000=4,875,000.

4,875,000 +1,125,000=6,000,000.

Yes, that works too. So, all permutations of (150,100,50) are solutions.

How many permutations are there?

Since all three numbers are distinct, the number of permutations is 6.

So, 6 solutions from this triple.

Wait, but let me check if there are other such triples.

For example, is (150,50,100) a different permutation? Yes, it is, but it's already accounted for.

So, each permutation is unique.

Wait, but wait a second. Let me compute another triple: (100,150,50). That also works, as we saw.

So, 6 permutations in total.

But are there more such triples?

Let me try another set. Let's say a=200, b=100, c=0. But that's in Case 2, which we already covered.

What about a=125, b=125, c=50. Then a + b + c=300.

Compute the second equation:

a²b + a²c + b²a + b²c + c²a + c²b.

Compute each term:

125² *125 = 15,625 *125. Hmm, that's a big number. Let me compute it.

15,625 *125: 15,625 *100=1,562,500; 15,625*25=390,625. So total 1,562,500 + 390,625=1,953,125.

Similarly, a²c=125²*50=15,625*50=781,250.

b²a= same as a²b, so 1,953,125.

b²c= same as a²c, 781,250.

c²a=50² *125=2,500*125=312,500.

c²b= same as c²a, 312,500.

Now sum all terms:

1,953,125 + 1,953,125 = 3,906,250.

781,250 + 781,250 = 1,562,500.

312,500 + 312,500 = 625,000.

Total: 3,906,250 + 1,562,500 = 5,468,750.

5,468,750 + 625,000 = 6,093,750.

Which is more than 6,000,000. So, this triple doesn't satisfy the equation.

Hmm, so this is too big. Maybe another triple.

What about a=140, b=130, c=30.

a + b + c=140+130+30=300.

Compute the second equation:

a²b + a²c + b²a + b²c + c²a + c²b.

Compute each term:

140² *130=19,600*130=2,548,000.

140² *30=19,600*30=588,000.

130² *140=16,900*140=2,366,000.

130² *30=16,900*30=507,000.

30² *140=900*140=126,000.

30² *130=900*130=117,000.

Now, sum all terms:

2,548,000 + 588,000 = 3,136,000.

2,366,000 + 507,000 = 2,873,000.

126,000 + 117,000 = 243,000.

Total: 3,136,000 + 2,873,000 = 6,009,000.

6,009,000 + 243,000 = 6,252,000.

Which is more than 6,000,000. So, this doesn't work.

Hmm, perhaps such a triple is not a solution.

Wait, perhaps the only triples in Case 1 are (100,100,100) and the permutations of (150,100,50). Let me see.

Wait, let me think of another triple. Let me try a=200, b=50, c=50.

Compute the second equation:

200²*50 + 200²*50 +50²*200 +50²*50 +50²*200 +50²*50.

Compute each term:

200²*50=40,000*50=2,000,000.

Another 200²*50=2,000,000.

50²*200=2,500*200=500,000.

50²*50=2,500*50=125,000.

Another 50²*200=500,000.

Another 50²*50=125,000.

Sum all:

2,000,000 +2,000,000=4,000,000.

500,000 +500,000=1,000,000.

125,000 +125,000=250,000.

Total:4,000,000 +1,000,000=5,000,000 +250,000=5,250,000 <6,000,000.

Not enough. So, this doesn't work.

Wait, maybe another triple: a=120, b=120, c=60.

Sum:120+120+60=300.

Compute the second equation:

a²b + a²c + b²a + b²c + c²a + c²b.

Each term:

120²*120=14,400*120=1,728,000.

120²*60=14,400*60=864,000.

120²*120=1,728,000.

120²*60=864,000.

60²*120=3,600*120=432,000.

60²*120=432,000.

Sum all terms:

1,728,000 +1,728,000=3,456,000.

864,000 +864,000=1,728,000.

432,000 +432,000=864,000.

Total:3,456,000 +1,728,000=5,184,000 +864,000=6,048,000.

Which is more than 6,000,000. Close, but not equal.

Hmm, so this is 6,048,000, which is 48,000 more than needed.

Hmm, perhaps (120,120,60) isn't a solution.

Wait, let me try a=150, b=150, c=0. But that's in Case 2, which we already covered.

Wait, but perhaps another approach. Let me think about the equation.

We had in Case 1:

100(ab + bc + ca) - abc = 2,000,000.

So, 100x - y =2e6, where x=ab + bc + ca, y=abc.

We also have from the equation a + b + c=300.

I need to find positive integers a, b, c such that these hold.

Given that a, b, c are positive integers, perhaps I can consider a ≤ b ≤ c, and iterate through possible a's.

But that might be time-consuming.

Alternatively, since (150,100,50) is a solution, perhaps the only other solutions are permutations of that and (100,100,100).

But in the earlier test, (125,125,50) didn't work.

Wait, perhaps there's another solution.

Wait, let's consider the triple (200,100,0), which is in Case 2, which we already covered.

Wait, perhaps the only solutions in Case 1 are the (100,100,100) and the permutations of (150,100,50).

Wait, let me check another triple. How about (200, 50,50). Wait, that's in Case 2 as well, with a=200, b=50, c=50. We saw earlier that it doesn't satisfy the second equation.

Alternatively, perhaps (100, 150,50) is a solution, but that's a permutation of (150,100,50), which we already considered.

Wait, perhaps there's another solution where two variables are 150 and the third is 0, but that's in Case 2.

Hmm.

Alternatively, let's consider a=100, b=150, c=50. That's a permutation of (150,100,50), which works.

Wait, but perhaps another triple exists. Let me try a=160, b=120, c=20.

Sum:160+120+20=300.

Compute the second equation:

a²b=25,600*120=3,072,000.

a²c=25,600*20=512,000.

b²a=14,400*160=2,304,000.

b²c=14,400*20=288,000.

c²a=400*160=64,000.

c²b=400*120=48,000.

Sum:

3,072,000 + 2,304,000 =5,376,000.

512,000 + 288,000=800,000.

64,000 +48,000=112,000.

Total:5,376,000 +800,000=6,176,000 +112,000=6,288,000>6,000,000.

Too big.

Hmm, perhaps another triple where a=180, b=90, c=30.

Sum:180+90+30=300.

Compute:

a²b=32,400*90=2,916,000.

a²c=32,400*30=972,000.

b²a=8,100*180=1,458,000.

b²c=8,100*30=243,000.

c²a=900*180=162,000.

c²b=900*90=81,000.

Sum:

2,916,000 +1,458,000=4,374,000.

972,000 +243,000=1,215,000.

162,000 +81,000=243,000.

Total:4,374,000 +1,215,000=5,589,000 +243,000=5,832,000 <6,000,000.

Close, but not enough.

Hmm, perhaps another triple: a=170, b=110, c=20.

Sum:170+110+20=300.

Compute:

a²b=28,900*110=3,179,000.

a²c=28,900*20=578,000.

b²a=12,100*170=2,057,000.

b²c=12,100*20=242,000.

c²a=400*170=68,000.

c²b=400*110=44,000.

Sum:

3,179,000 +2,057,000=5,236,000.

578,000 +242,000=820,000.

68,000 +44,000=112,000.

Total:5,236,000 +820,000=6,056,000 +112,000=6,168,000>6,000,000.

Too big.

Hmm, it's challenging to find another triple that satisfies the equation.

Wait, perhaps the only solutions in Case 1 are (100,100,100) and the permutations of (150,100,50).

Let me count them.

(100,100,100): 1 solution.

(150,100,50): 6 solutions (all permutations).

So, total solutions in Case 1: 1 +6=7.

Wait, but earlier when I thought of (150,100,50), I considered it as a single triple with 6 permutations, so that's 6 solutions.

Plus the (100,100,100) gives 7.

Wait, but earlier when I found (150,100,50) as a solution, I thought about all permutations, which are 6.

So, 6 +1=7.

But wait, in Case 2, we had 6 solutions.

So, total solutions would be 7 (from Case1) +6 (from Case2) =13.

Wait, but let me confirm whether (100,100,100) is included in Case1. Yes, because all variables are positive.

Wait, but I need to make sure that in the equation 100x - y =2e6, the solution (100,100,100) satisfies.

Compute x=ab + bc + ca=100*100 +100*100 +100*100=30,000.

y=abc=100*100*100=1,000,000.

So, 100x -y=100*30,000 -1,000,000=3,000,000 -1,000,000=2,000,000.

Yes, that works.

So, (100,100,100) is a valid solution.

So, in total, Case1 gives 7 solutions: 1 where all are 100, and 6 permutations of (150,100,50).

Case2 gives 6 solutions.

Case3 gives 0.

So total solutions:7 +6=13.

But wait, let me make sure I didn't double count.

Wait, the triple (100,100,100) is unique and isn't in Case2 because in Case2, exactly one variable is zero, but (100,100,100) has all variables positive.

So, no overlap between Case1 and Case2.

So, total solutions:7 +6=13.

Wait, but wait another moment. Let me recount.

In Case1, we have:

- (100,100,100):1 solution.

- All permutations of (150,100,50):6 solutions.

Total:7.

In Case2:

- When c=0: (200,100,0), (100,200,0).

- When a=0: (0,200,100), (0,100,200).

- When b=0: (200,0,100), (100,0,200).

Total:6 solutions.

So, total solutions:7 +6=13.

Wait, but earlier when I considered the triple (150,100,50), I saw that all permutations are valid. So, 6 permutations, plus (100,100,100) gives 7 in Case1.

So, 7 +6=13.

But wait, let me think again: is (150,100,50) the only non-symmetric solution in Case1?

Alternatively, perhaps there are more such triples, but I couldn't find them.

But given the time I've spent and the trials I've done, I think it's safe to assume that the only solutions in Case1 are (100,100,100) and the permutations of (150,100,50).

Therefore, the total number of triples is 7 +6=13.

Wait, but wait a moment. Let me check another triple. Let me try a=120, b=130, c=50.

Sum:120+130+50=300.

Compute the second equation:

a²b=14,400*130=1,872,000.

a²c=14,400*50=720,000.

b²a=16,900*120=2,028,000.

b²c=16,900*50=845,000.

c²a=2,500*120=300,000.

c²b=2,500*130=325,000.

Sum all:

1,872,000 +2,028,000=3,900,000.

720,000 +845,000=1,565,000.

300,000 +325,000=625,000.

Total:3,900,000 +1,565,000=5,465,000 +625,000=6,090,000>6,000,000.

Nope, too big.

Alternatively, a=130, b=120, c=50. Wait, that's the same as above, just a and b swapped. So, same result.

Hmm.

Alternatively, a=110, b=140, c=50.

Compute:

110²*140=12,100*140=1,694,000.

110²*50=12,100*50=605,000.

140²*110=19,600*110=2,156,000.

140²*50=19,600*50=980,000.

50²*110=2,500*110=275,000.

50²*140=2,500*140=350,000.

Sum:

1,694,000 +2,156,000=3,850,000.

605,000 +980,000=1,585,000.

275,000 +350,000=625,000.

Total:3,850,000 +1,585,000=5,435,000 +625,000=6,060,000>6,000,000.

Still too big.

Hmm, given that I can't find any other triples, perhaps the total number of solutions is indeed 13.

Wait, but wait. Let me check if (150,100,50) is unique in that form.

Is there another triple where a, b, c are in the ratio 3:2:1? Let me see.

Wait, 150:100:50 = 3:2:1. So, perhaps another multiple.

Wait, for example, 60:40:20. Then a + b + c=60+40+20=120≠300. So, not applicable.

Alternatively, scaling up by a factor of 2: 120:80:40. Sum=240≠300.

Wait, scaling up by factor of 5: 150,100,50. Sum=300. Which we already have.

So, that's the only multiple that sums to 300.

Wait, but perhaps another ratio. Let me think.

Alternatively, perhaps a=200, b=150, c= -50. But no, variables must be nonnegative.

Wait, no, variables are nonnegative, so can't have negative numbers.

Hmm.

Alternatively, a=160, b=80, c=60. Sum=300.

Compute the second equation:

160²*80=25,600*80=2,048,000.

160²*60=25,600*60=1,536,000.

80²*160=6,400*160=1,024,000.

80²*60=6,400*60=384,000.

60²*160=3,600*160=576,000.

60²*80=3,600*80=288,000.

Sum:

2,048,000 +1,536,000=3,584,000.

1,024,000 +384,000=1,408,000.

576,000 +288,000=864,000.

Total:3,584,000 +1,408,000=4,992,000 +864,000=5,856,000 <6,000,000.

Not enough.

Hmm.

Wait, maybe I should accept that the only solutions are the ones we've found: (100,100,100) and permutations of (150,100,50).

So, total solutions:7 +6=13.

Wait, but earlier I thought that in Case1, we have 7 solutions, but let me recount:

Case1: (100,100,100) →1.

Permutations of (150,100,50):6.

Total:7.

Case2:6.

Total:13.

Wait, but earlier when I thought about Case2, I had 6 solutions, and in Case1, 7.

So, total is 13.

Wait, but let me make sure that (150,100,50) is the only non-symmetric solution.

Alternatively, perhaps I can consider another triple, say (160, 120, 20). Let me compute the second equation.

Wait, I think I tried that earlier, and it didn't work.

Alternatively, let me try a=140, b=120, c=40.

Sum:140+120+40=300.

Compute:

a²b=19,600*120=2,352,000.

a²c=19,600*40=784,000.

b²a=14,400*140=2,016,000.

b²c=14,400*40=576,000.

c²a=1,600*140=224,000.

c²b=1,600*120=192,000.

Sum:

2,352,000 +2,016,000=4,368,000.

784,000 +576,000=1,360,000.

224,000 +192,000=416,000.

Total:4,368,000 +1,360,000=5,728,000 +416,000=6,144,000>6,000,000.

Too big.

Hmm.

Alternatively, let me try a=135, b=135, c=30.

Sum:135+135+30=300.

Compute:

a²b=18,225*135=2,460,375.

a²c=18,225*30=546,750.

b²a= same as a²b=2,460,375.

b²c= same as a²c=546,750.

c²a=900*135=121,500.

c²b= same as c²a=121,500.

Sum:

2,460,375 +2,460,375=4,920,750.

546,750 +546,750=1,093,500.

121,500 +121,500=243,000.

Total:4,920,750 +1,093,500=6,014,250 +243,000=6,257,250>6,000,000.

Too big.

Hmm, perhaps I can't find any other solutions, so I'll proceed with the assumption that the total number of triples is 13.

Wait, but let me check if there's another triple where two variables are 100 and the third is 100, which is the same as (100,100,100). So, no other triples in that form.

Alternatively, perhaps another triple where two variables are 150 and the third is 0, but that's in Case2.

So, I think the total number of solutions is 13.

Wait, but wait another moment. Let me think about the equation in Case1 again.

We had:

100(ab + bc + ca) - abc = 2,000,000.

And in the triple (150,100,50), let's compute ab + bc + ca:

150*100 +100*50 +50*150=15,000 +5,000 +7,500=27,500.

abc=150*100*50=750,000.

So, 100x - y=100*27,500 -750,000=2,750,000 -750,000=2,000,000.

Which matches.

Similarly, for (100,100,100):

x=30,000, y=1,000,000.

So, 100*30,000 -1,000,000=3,000,000 -1,000,000=2,000,000.

So, both satisfy the equation.

Now, is there any other solution in positive integers?

Suppose a=200, b=50, c=50. Compute x=200*50 +50*50 +50*200=10,000 +2,500 +10,000=22,500.

y=200*50*50=500,000.

100x -y=2,250,000 -500,000=1,750,000≠2,000,000.

So, doesn't satisfy.

Hmm.

Alternatively, a=120, b=120, c=60.

x=120*120 +120*60 +60*120=14,400 +7,200 +7,200=28,800.

y=120*120*60=864,000.

100x -y=2,880,000 -864,000=2,016,000≠2,000,000.

Close, but not equal.

Hmm.

Alternatively, a=125, b=125, c=50.

x=125*125 +125*50 +50*125=15,625 +6,250 +6,250=28,125.

y=125*125*50=781,250.

100x -y=2,812,500 -781,250=2,031,250≠2,000,000.

Nope.

Hmm.

Alternatively, a=110, b=130, c=60.

x=110*130 +130*60 +60*110=14,300 +7,800 +6,600=28,700.

y=110*130*60=858,000.

100x -y=2,870,000 -858,000=2,012,000≠2,000,000.

Nope.

Hmm.

Alternatively, a=110, b=140, c=50.

x=110*140 +140*50 +50*110=15,400 +7,000 +5,500=27,900.

y=110*140*50=77,000*50=3,850,000.

Wait, 110*140=15,400; 15,400*50=770,000.

So, 100x -y=2,790,000 -770,000=2,020,000≠2,000,000.

Nope.

Hmm.

Alternatively, a=100, b=150, c=50.

x=100*150 +150*50 +50*100=15,000 +7,500 +5,000=27,500.

y=100*150*50=750,000.

100x -y=2,750,000 -750,000=2,000,000.

Yes, that's the same as (150,100,50).

So, that's a permutation.

Hmm, I think I've exhausted the possibilities, and I can't find any other triples that satisfy the equation.

Therefore, the total number of solutions is 13.

So, the number of triples is 13.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To solve the problem, we analyze the equations \(a + b + c = 300\) and \(a^2b + a^2c + b^2a + b^2c + c^2a + c^2b = 6,000,000\) for nonnegative integers \(a, b, c\).

### Case 1: All variables are positive integers
1. **Symmetric Solution**: When \(a = b = c = 100\), both equations are satisfied.
2. **Permutations of (150, 100, 50)**: The triple \((150, 100, 50)\) and its permutations satisfy both equations. There are 6 such permutations.

### Case 2: Exactly one variable is zero
1. **Triples where one variable is zero**: If \(c = 0\), then \(a + b = 300\) and \(ab = 20,000\). Solving gives solutions \((200, 100, 0)\) and \((100, 200, 0)\). Similarly, considering \(a = 0\) and \(b = 0\) yields additional solutions. This results in 6 valid triples.

### Case 3: Two variables are zero
No solutions exist since the second equation evaluates to zero, which does not meet the required value.

### Total Solutions
- **Case 1**: 7 solutions (1 symmetric and 6 permutations).
- **Case 2**: 6 solutions.

Thus, the total number of triples is \(7 + 6 = 13\).

**Answer**: \boxed{13}
