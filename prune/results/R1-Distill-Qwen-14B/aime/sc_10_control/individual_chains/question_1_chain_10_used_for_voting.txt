Okay, so I've got this problem here with logarithms and three variables, x, y, and z. They’re all positive real numbers, which is good because logarithms of non-positive numbers aren't defined. The problem gives me three equations involving logarithms base 2, and I need to find the absolute value of log base 2 of (x^4 y^3 z^2), which will be a fraction m/n where m and n are coprime. Then, I have to find m + n.

Let me write down the equations to make it clearer:

1. log₂(x/(y z)) = 1/2
2. log₂(y/(x z)) = 1/3
3. log₂(z/(x y)) = 1/4

Hmm. So each equation is a logarithm of a fraction equal to a fraction. I remember that log_b(a) = c is equivalent to b^c = a. So maybe I can rewrite these equations in exponential form to simplify.

Let me try that for each equation.

Starting with the first equation:

log₂(x/(y z)) = 1/2

This means 2^(1/2) = x/(y z). Which is the same as:

x = 2^(1/2) * y z

Similarly, for the second equation:

log₂(y/(x z)) = 1/3

That becomes:

2^(1/3) = y/(x z) => y = 2^(1/3) * x z

And the third equation:

log₂(z/(x y)) = 1/4

So:

2^(1/4) = z/(x y) => z = 2^(1/4) * x y

Alright, so now I have expressions for x, y, and z in terms of the other two variables each time. Hmm, this seems like a system of equations that might be solvable by substitution or maybe by multiplying them together.

Let me see if I can express each variable in terms of another. Alternatively, maybe I can take the product of all three equations.

Wait, another thought: since each equation expresses one variable in terms of the others, perhaps I can substitute them into each other to find each variable.

Let me write down the three equations again:

1. x = 2^(1/2) * y z
2. y = 2^(1/3) * x z
3. z = 2^(1/4) * x y

Hmm. So each variable is expressed as a multiple of the product of the other two. Maybe I can substitute these into each other.

Let me try substituting equation 2 into equation 1.

From equation 1: x = 2^(1/2) * y z

But from equation 2, y = 2^(1/3) * x z. So substitute that into equation 1:

x = 2^(1/2) * [2^(1/3) * x z] * z

Simplify the right side:

x = 2^(1/2 + 1/3) * x * z^2

Wait, 2^(1/2 + 1/3) is 2^(5/6). So:

x = 2^(5/6) * x * z^2

Hmm, so if I divide both sides by x (since x is positive and not zero), I get:

1 = 2^(5/6) * z^2

Then, solving for z^2:

z^2 = 1 / 2^(5/6) = 2^(-5/6)

Taking square roots, z = 2^(-5/12). Because sqrt(2^(-5/6)) = 2^(-5/12).

Okay, so z is 2^(-5/12). Let me write that down.

z = 2^(-5/12)

Now, let's see if I can find x or y using this.

Let me use equation 3, which is z = 2^(1/4) * x y. Since I know z, let's substitute:

2^(-5/12) = 2^(1/4) * x y

Let me solve for x y:

x y = 2^(-5/12) / 2^(1/4) = 2^(-5/12 - 3/12) = 2^(-8/12) = 2^(-2/3)

So, x y = 2^(-2/3)

Hmm, that's interesting. Now, let's go back to equation 2: y = 2^(1/3) * x z

We know z = 2^(-5/12), so substituting:

y = 2^(1/3) * x * 2^(-5/12)

Simplify the exponents:

2^(1/3) is 2^(4/12), 2^(-5/12) is 2^(-5/12). So together:

2^(4/12 -5/12) = 2^(-1/12)

So, y = 2^(-1/12) * x

So, y = x * 2^(-1/12)

Alternatively, y = x / 2^(1/12)

Now, I have y in terms of x. Let's substitute this into the expression for x y.

We had x y = 2^(-2/3), and since y = x / 2^(1/12), then:

x * (x / 2^(1/12)) = 2^(-2/3)

Which is:

x^2 / 2^(1/12) = 2^(-2/3)

Multiply both sides by 2^(1/12):

x^2 = 2^(-2/3) * 2^(1/12) = 2^(-2/3 + 1/12) = 2^(-8/12 + 1/12) = 2^(-7/12)

So x^2 = 2^(-7/12). Taking square roots:

x = 2^(-7/24)

Wait, because sqrt(2^(-7/12)) = 2^(-7/24). Since sqrt(2^a) is 2^(a/2). So

x = 2^(-7/24)

Now, since y = x * 2^(-1/12), we can find y:

y = 2^(-7/24) * 2^(-1/12) = 2^(-7/24 - 2/24) = 2^(-9/24) = 2^(-3/8)

So y = 2^(-3/8)

Let me recap the values I have:

x = 2^(-7/24)

y = 2^(-3/8)

z = 2^(-5/12)

Hmm, let me check if these satisfy the original equations. Let's test equation 1:

log₂(x/(y z)) = ?

x/(y z) = [2^(-7/24)] / [2^(-3/8) * 2^(-5/12)]

Adding exponents in the denominator:

-3/8 + (-5/12) = (-9/24 -10/24) = -19/24

So numerator is 2^(-7/24), denominator is 2^(-19/24). So overall:

2^(-7/24) / 2^(-19/24) = 2^(12/24) = 2^(1/2)

So log₂(2^(1/2)) = 1/2, which matches equation 1. Good.

Similarly, let's check equation 2:

log₂(y/(x z)) = ?

y/(x z) = [2^(-3/8)] / [2^(-7/24) * 2^(-5/12)]

Exponents in denominator: -7/24 + (-5/12) = -7/24 -10/24 = -17/24

So y/(x z) = 2^(-3/8) / 2^(-17/24) = 2^(-9/24 +17/24) = 2^(8/24) = 2^(1/3)

So log₂(2^(1/3)) = 1/3, which matches equation 2. Good.

Equation 3:

log₂(z/(x y)) = ?

z/(x y) = [2^(-5/12)] / [2^(-7/24) * 2^(-3/8)]

Denominator exponents: -7/24 + (-3/8) = -7/24 -9/24 = -16/24 = -2/3

So z/(x y) = 2^(-5/12) / 2^(-2/3) = 2^(-5/12 + 8/12) = 2^(3/12) = 2^(1/4)

So log₂(2^(1/4)) = 1/4, which is equation 3. Perfect, so the values are correct.

Now, the problem asks for |log₂(x^4 y^3 z^2)|.

Let me compute log₂(x^4 y^3 z^2). Since all exponents are positive, and x, y, z are positive, the absolute value won't change anything, so I can just compute it as is.

Expressed in terms of exponents, log₂(x^4 y^3 z^2) = 4 log₂ x + 3 log₂ y + 2 log₂ z.

But since I have x, y, z in terms of exponents of 2, it's easier to compute their exponents.

x = 2^(-7/24), so log₂ x = -7/24

Similarly, log₂ y = -3/8, and log₂ z = -5/12.

So putting it all together:

4 log₂ x = 4 * (-7/24) = -28/24 = -7/6

3 log₂ y = 3 * (-3/8) = -9/8

2 log₂ z = 2 * (-5/12) = -10/12 = -5/6

Adding them all up:

-7/6 - 9/8 -5/6

First, to add these fractions, I need a common denominator. The denominators are 6, 8, 6. The least common multiple is 24.

Convert each term:

-7/6 = (-28)/24

-9/8 = (-27)/24

-5/6 = (-20)/24

Adding them:

-28 -27 -20 = -75

So total is -75/24.

Simplify: -75/24 can be reduced. Both are divisible by 3: 75 ÷3=25, 24 ÷3=8.

So, -25/8.

But since we take absolute value, | -25/8 | = 25/8.

So the value is 25/8, which is already in lowest terms because 25 and 8 share no common divisors except 1.

Therefore, m =25, n=8, m +n=33.

Wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.

Starting with the exponents:

x = 2^(-7/24), so log₂x = -7/24, correct.

y = 2^(-3/8), so log₂ y = -3/8, correct.

z = 2^(-5/12), so log₂z = -5/12, correct.

Compute 4 log₂x: 4*(-7/24)= -28/24= -7/6

3 log₂y: 3*(-3/8)= -9/8

2 log₂z: 2*(-5/12)= -10/12= -5/6

Now, adding them: -7/6 -9/8 -5/6

Wait, let's add -7/6 and -5/6 first: that's (-7 -5)/6= -12/6= -2

So now, -2 -9/8.

Convert -2 to eighths: -16/8 -9/8= -25/8.

So yes, correct. So the log is -25/8, absolute value is 25/8.

So 25 and 8 are coprime, so m=25, n=8, m +n=33.

Yes, that seems correct.

To solve the given system of logarithmic equations, we start by converting each logarithmic equation to its exponential form:

1. \(\log_2\left(\frac{x}{yz}\right) = \frac{1}{2}\) implies \(x = 2^{1/2} \cdot yz\).
2. \(\log_2\left(\frac{y}{xz}\right) = \frac{1}{3}\) implies \(y = 2^{1/3} \cdot xz\).
3. \(\log_2\left(\frac{z}{xy}\right) = \frac{1}{4}\) implies \(z = 2^{1/4} \cdot xy\).

Substituting these expressions into each other, we find:

- From equations 1 and 2, substituting \(y = 2^{1/3} \cdot xz\) into \(x = 2^{1/2} \cdot yz\), we get \(x = 2^{5/6} \cdot x z^2\), leading to \(z^2 = 2^{-5/6}\) and \(z = 2^{-5/12}\).
- Using \(z = 2^{-5/12}\) in equation 3, we find \(xy = 2^{-2/3}\).
- Substituting \(z\) into equation 2, we express \(y\) in terms of \(x\): \(y = x \cdot 2^{-1/12}\).
- Substituting \(y = x \cdot 2^{-1/12}\) into \(xy = 2^{-2/3}\), we solve for \(x\), finding \(x = 2^{-7/24}\).
- Finally, using \(x\) to find \(y\), we get \(y = 2^{-3/8}\).

With \(x = 2^{-7/24}\), \(y = 2^{-3/8}\), and \(z = 2^{-5/12}\), we compute \(\log_2(x^4 y^3 z^2)\):

\[
\log_2(x^4 y^3 z^2) = 4\log_2 x + 3\log_2 y + 2\log_2 z
\]

Substituting the values:

\[
4\left(-\frac{7}{24}\right) + 3\left(-\frac{3}{8}\right) + 2\left(-\frac{5}{12}\right) = -\frac{7}{6} - \frac{9}{8} - \frac{5}{6}
\]

Converting to a common denominator (24):

\[
-\frac{28}{24} - \frac{27}{24} - \frac{20}{24} = -\frac{75}{24} = -\frac{25}{8}
\]

Taking the absolute value, we get \(\frac{25}{8}\). Thus, \(m = 25\) and \(n = 8\), leading to \(m + n = 33\).

\(\boxed{33}\)
