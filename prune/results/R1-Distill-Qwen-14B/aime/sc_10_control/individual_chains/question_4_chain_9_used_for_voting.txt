Okay, so I've got this problem where Alice and Bob are playing a game with a stack of n tokens. They take turns removing either 1 or 4 tokens each turn, and the person who takes the last token wins. I need to find how many positive integers n ≤ 2024 allow Bob to have a winning strategy, no matter how Alice plays.

Hmm, let me break this down. Since Alice goes first, Bob's ability to win depends on the starting number of tokens. I think this is a classic combinatorial game problem, so maybe I can model it using something like the Sprague-Grundy theorem or by finding a pattern in winning and losing positions.

Wait, let's start by considering small values of n and see if a pattern emerges. Often, these types of games have periodic patterns, so maybe I can find the losing positions (where the current player cannot force a win) and then count how many such positions are there up to 2024.

Let's list out the possible outcomes for small n:

n = 0: Well, this is a losing position because there are no tokens to take. But in our problem, n starts from 1, so maybe we can ignore this.

n = 1: Alice takes 1 token and wins. So Bob can't win here.

n = 2: Alice can take 1 token, leaving 1 token for Bob. Then Bob takes the last one and wins. Wait, but hold on—if Alice takes 1, Bob takes 1 and wins. So n=2 is a winning position for Bob if Alice makes a mistake? No, wait, Alice is trying to win, so she won't make a mistake. Wait, no, because Alice can choose whether to take 1 or 4 tokens each turn. Wait, but when n=2, Alice can only take 1 because she can't take 4. So she takes 1, leaving 1 for Bob, who then takes it and wins. So n=2 is a winning position for Bob. But wait, no, because if n=2, Alice takes 1, leaving 1, which is a winning position for Bob because Bob can take it. So in this case, does that mean that Bob can win when n=2? Hmm, maybe I need to think in terms of P-positions and N-positions.

Wait, let's define P-positions as those where the previous player can force a win, regardless of what the next player does. Or wait, maybe I have that backwards. Actually, in combinatorial game theory, P-positions are those where the previous player can force a win, which are also called losing positions for the current player. So if I'm the current player and I'm faced with a P-position, then no matter what I do, the opponent can win. On the other hand, N-positions are those where the current player can force a win.

Wait, perhaps it's better to model each n as either a winning (N-position) or losing (P-position) position for the current player.

Let me try to model for n from 0 upwards.

n=0: P-position (no moves possible, so current player loses)
n=1: Current player can take 1 and win, so N-position.
n=2: Current player takes 1, leaving n=1 for opponent (N-position). But wait, if the opponent is in an N-position, that means the current player just gave them a chance to win. Wait, no—wait, if I take 1 from n=2, leaving n=1 for the opponent, which is an N-position, meaning the opponent can win. So that's bad for me. So if I take 1, opponent can win. Are there any other moves? No, because I can't take 4. So n=2 must be a P-position? Because the current player can't force a win, so it's a losing position.

Wait, that doesn't make sense with my earlier thought. Let me re-examine.

Wait, for n=2, if I take 1, opponent gets n=1 and takes it to win. So for n=2, current player can't force a win, so it's a P-position.

n=3: Current player can take 1, leaving n=2, which is a P-position. So the opponent is now faced with a P-position, meaning they can't force a win, so the current player can win by moving to n=2. So n=3 is an N-position.

n=4: Current player can take 4 and win immediately. So n=4 is an N-position.

n=5: Let's see. The current player can take 1, leaving n=4 (N-position), or take 4, leaving n=1 (N-position). But if the current player leaves the opponent in an N-position, that's bad because the opponent can win. Alternatively, maybe the current player can leave the opponent in a P-position. Wait, let me check if any of the moves from n=5 lead to a P-position.

From n=5, taking 1 leads to n=4 (N), taking 4 leads to n=1 (N). So both options leave opponent in N-positions, meaning n=5 is a P-position. Because no matter what the current player does, the opponent can win.

Wait, that's interesting. So n=5 is a P-position.

n=6: Let's see. The current player can take 1, leaving n=5 (P-position). Since P-position is losing for the opponent, that means the current player can force a win by moving to n=5. So n=6 is an N-position.

n=7: Current player can take 1, leaving n=6 (N), or take 4, leaving n=3 (N). So if all moves from n=7 lead to N-positions, then n=7 must be a P-position. Because no matter what you do, the opponent can win.

Wait, is that right? If I take 1 from 7, opponent gets 6 (N), so they can win. If I take 4 from 7, opponent gets 3 (N), so they can win. So yes, n=7 is a P-position.

n=8: Current player can take 1, leaving n=7 (P), or take 4, leaving n=4 (N). So if the current player takes 1, leaving n=7 (P), then the opponent is in a losing position. So current player can force a win by moving to n=7. So n=8 is an N-position.

n=9: Let's see. Current player can take 1, leaving n=8 (N), or take 4, leaving n=5 (P). So if the current player takes 4, leaving n=5 (P), then opponent is in a losing position. So n=9 is an N-position because the current player can force a win by moving to a P-position.

n=10: Current player can take 1, leaving n=9 (N), or take 4, leaving n=6 (N). So all moves lead to N-positions. Thus, n=10 is a P-position.

Wait, so let me list these out:

n : 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16
pos: P N P N N P N P N N P  ... ?

Wait, let me confirm:

n=0: P

n=1: N (can take 1 to win)

n=2: P (only can take 1, leaving n=1 for opponent, which is N, so opponent can win, so current player can't force a win)

n=3: N (take 1, leaving n=2 (P), so opponent can't win, so current player can win)

n=4: N (take 4 and win)

n=5: P (taking 1 leads to n=4 (N), taking 4 leads to n=1 (N). Both options leave opponent in N, so current player can't force a win, so n=5 is P)

n=6: N (take 1, leaving n=5 (P), opponent can't win. So current player can win)

n=7: P (taking 1 leads to n=6 (N), taking 4 leads to n=3 (N). Both moves leave opponent in N, so current player can't force a win, so n=7 is P)

n=8: N (take 1, leaving n=7 (P), so opponent can't win. Current player can win)

n=9: N (take 4, leaving n=5 (P), opponent can't win. So current player can win)

n=10: P (taking 1 leads to n=9 (N), taking 4 leads to n=6 (N). So both options leave opponent in N, so current player can't force a win. So n=10 is P)

n=11: N (taking 1 leads to n=10 (P), so opponent can't win. Current player can win)

n=12: N (taking 4 leads to n=8 (N), but wait, taking 1 leads to n=11 (N). Hmm, maybe I made a mistake. Wait, n=12 can take 1, leading to n=11 (N), or take 4, leading to n=8 (N). So if all moves lead to N-positions, then n=12 would be P. But wait, no, because if current player can't move to a P-position, then n=12 is P.

Wait, let's re-examine: For n=12, possible moves are to n=11 (N) and n=8 (N). Since both are N-positions, so current player can't force a win, so n=12 is P.

Wait, but earlier at n=6, taking 1 leads to n=5 (P), so n=6 is N. Similarly, n=8: taking 1 leads to n=7 (P), so n=8 is N.

So n=12 is P.

n=13: Current player can take 1, leading to n=12 (P), so opponent can't win. So current player can win, making n=13 N.

n=14: Current player can take 1, leading to n=13 (N), or take 4, leading to n=10 (P). So if current player takes 4, leaving n=10 (P), opponent can't win. So n=14 is N.

n=15: Current player can take 1, leading to n=14 (N), or take 4, leading to n=11 (N). So all moves lead to N-positions, making n=15 a P-position.

Wait a second, so the pattern so far is:

n : 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16
pos: P N P N N P N P N N P N P N N P ...

Wait, let me check n=16. Current player can take 1, leading to n=15 (P), so opponent can't win. So n=16 is N.

So perhaps the pattern repeats every 5? Let me see.

Looking at the positions, from n=0 to n=7, the positions are P, N, P, N, N, P, N, P.

Wait, that's a cycle of 5: P, N, P, N, N, then P again at n=5.

Wait, from n=0: P

n=1: N

n=2: P

n=3: N

n=4: N

n=5: P

n=6: N

n=7: P

n=8: N

n=9: N

n=10: P

n=11: N

n=12: P

n=13: N

n=14: N

n=15: P

n=16: N

Hmmm, so the pattern seems to be P, N, P, N, N, repeating every 5.

Wait, so positions 0, 2, 5, 7, 10, 12, 15, 17,... are P-positions.

Wait, but let me check n=10: 10 is P, then n=11: N, n=12: P, n=13: N, n=14: N, n=15: P, n=16: N, n=17: P.

Yes, the pattern seems to be that every 5 steps, the P-positions occur at n=0,2,5,7,10,12,15,17,20, etc.

Wait, so the P-positions are numbers congruent to 0, 2, or 3 mod 5? No, wait.

Looking at the P-positions up to n=15: 0,2,5,7,10,12,15.

Wait, 0 mod5 is 0.

2 mod5 is 2.

5 mod5 is 0.

7 mod5 is 2.

10 mod5 is 0.

12 mod5 is 2.

15 mod5 is 0.

So it's every number divisible by 5 (0,5,10,15,...) and numbers that are 2 mod5 (2,7,12,17,...).

Wait, but wait: n=5 is 0 mod5, n=7 is 2 mod5, n=10 is 0 mod5, n=12 is 2 mod5, n=15 is 0 mod5, etc.

So P-positions are numbers where n ≡ 0 mod5 or n ≡ 2 mod5.

Wait, but let me check n=20: n=20 is 0 mod5, so P-position. Then n=21: N, n=22: P, etc.

So the P-positions are n ≡0 or 2 mod5.

Wait, but let's check n=3: n=3 is 3 mod5, which is an N-position.

Wait, maybe the P-positions are n ≡0 or 2 mod5.

Wait, what about n=5: yes, 0 mod5, P.

n=7: 2 mod5, P.

n=10: 0 mod5, P.

n=12: 2 mod5, P.

n=15: 0 mod5, P.

n=17: 2 mod5, P.

So the P-positions are numbers where n mod5 is 0 or 2.

If that's the case, then the losing positions are when n ≡0 or 2 mod5.

So for Bob to have a winning strategy, the starting number of tokens n must be a P-position, i.e., n ≡0 or 2 mod5.

Wait, but let's make sure. Because if n is a P-position, then the first player (Alice) cannot force a win, so Bob can. So the number of such n ≤2024 where n is 0 or 2 mod5.

Wait, but n=0 isn't considered since n starts from 1. So we count n=2,5,7,10,12,... up to 2024.

So how many numbers ≤2024 are ≡0 or 2 mod5.

Let me calculate the count.

First, find the numbers ≡0 mod5: these are 5,10,15,... up to the maximum ≤2024.

Similarly, numbers ≡2 mod5: 2,7,12,... up to ≤2024.

Let me compute each separately.

For ≡0 mod5:

The smallest is 5, largest is 2020 (since 2020=5×404, 2025 would be 5×405=2025 which is over 2024).

So the count is 2020 /5 = 404 numbers.

Similarly, for ≡2 mod5:

The numbers start at 2, then 7,12,... up to the largest ≤2024.

What's the largest number ≤2024 that is ≡2 mod5?

2024 divided by 5: 2024/5=404.8, so 5×404=2020, 2020+2=2022.

So the sequence is 2,7,12,...2022.

This is an arithmetic sequence with first term a=2, common difference d=5.

The nth term is a + (n-1)*d = 2 +5(n-1)=5n-3.

Set 5n-3 ≤2024 →5n ≤2027 →n ≤405.4. So n=405.

So the count is 405 numbers.

Wait, let me check:

The last term is when 5n-3=2022 →5n=2025 →n=405.

So yes, 405 terms.

So total P-positions are numbers ≡0 mod5: 404, and ≡2 mod5:405.

Wait, but wait, when counting ≡0 mod5, from 5 to 2020, that's 2020/5=404 numbers.

For ≡2 mod5, from 2 to 2022, which is (2022-2)/5 +1 = (2020)/5 +1=404+1=405.

So total P-positions are 404 +405=809.

Wait, but let me check if 2022 is the last term ≤2024.

Yes, 2022 +5=2027>2024, so 2022 is correct.

So the total P-positions are 404 +405=809.

So the answer is 809.

Wait, but I should make sure that my initial analysis is correct. Let me verify with a few more terms.

n=16: N

n=17: P (2 mod5=17 mod5=2). Correct.

n=18: N

n=19: N

n=20: P (0 mod5)

n=21: N

n=22: P (2 mod5)

Yes, the pattern holds. So the P-positions are n ≡0 or 2 mod5.

Thus, the number of such n ≤2024 is 404 (for 0 mod5) plus 405 (for 2 mod5), totaling 809.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the number of positive integers \( n \leq 2024 \) for which Bob can guarantee a win, we analyze the game by identifying winning (N-positions) and losing (P-positions) positions.

1. **Game Analysis**:
   - Players take turns removing 1 or 4 tokens.
   - The player who removes the last token wins.
   - Positions where the current player cannot force a win are P-positions; otherwise, they are N-positions.

2. **Pattern Identification**:
   - By examining small \( n \), we observe that P-positions occur at \( n \equiv 0 \) or \( 2 \mod 5 \).
   - This pattern repeats every 5 numbers.

3. **Counting P-positions**:
   - **For \( n \equiv 0 \mod 5 \)**: The sequence is 5, 10, 15, ..., 2020. This gives \( \frac{2020}{5} = 404 \) numbers.
   - **For \( n \equiv 2 \mod 5 \)**: The sequence is 2, 7, 12, ..., 2022. This gives \( \frac{2022 - 2}{5} + 1 = 405 \) numbers.

4. **Total P-positions**:
   - Summing both cases: \( 404 + 405 = 809 \).

Thus, the number of positive integers \( n \leq 2024 \) where Bob can guarantee a win is **809**.

\boxed{809}
