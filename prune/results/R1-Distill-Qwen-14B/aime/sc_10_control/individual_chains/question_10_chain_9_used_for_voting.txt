Okay, so I've got this math problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again to make sure I understand.

"Alice chooses a set A of positive integers. Then Bob lists all finite nonempty sets B of positive integers with the property that the maximum element of B belongs to A. Bob's list has 2024 sets. Find the sum of the elements of A."

Hmm. So, Alice picks a set A, and based on that, Bob makes a list of all finite non-empty sets B where the maximum of B is in A. The number of such sets B is 2024. We need to find the sum of the elements in A.

Alright, let's break this down. First, let's understand what Bob is doing. He is listing all finite non-empty sets B where the maximum element of B is in A. So, for each element m in A, Bob can create sets B where m is the maximum. Each such set B would consist of any combination of elements from the positive integers, as long as all elements are less than or equal to m, and m is included.

So, for a single m in A, how many such sets B can we form? Well, if the maximum is m, the other elements of B can be any subset of {1, 2, ..., m-1}, but since B must be non-empty, and m is included, the number of possible sets B for a given m is 2^{m-1}. Because each element less than m can be either included or not, and m is always included. That makes sense.

Therefore, if A has elements m_1, m_2, ..., m_k, then the total number of sets B that Bob can list is the sum over each m in A of 2^{m-1}. So, total sets = sum_{m in A} 2^{m-1} = 2024.

So, our equation is sum_{m in A} 2^{m-1} = 2024.

Our goal is to find the sum of elements in A, which is sum_{m in A} m.

Now, the problem is essentially to find a set A such that the sum of 2^{m-1} for each m in A equals 2024, and then find the sum of the elements in A.

Hmm, okay. So, this seems connected to binary representations or something because 2^{m-1} is a power of two. Maybe A is a set where each 2^{m-1} corresponds to a bit in the binary representation of 2024, but I'm not entirely sure yet.

Wait, let's think. Let's represent 2024 in binary. Maybe that will help. So, 2024 divided by 2:

2024 ÷ 2 = 1012, remainder 0

1012 ÷ 2 = 506, remainder 0

506 ÷ 2 = 253, remainder 0

253 ÷ 2 = 126, remainder 1

126 ÷ 2 = 63, remainder 0

63 ÷ 2 = 31, remainder 1

31 ÷ 2 = 15, remainder 1

15 ÷ 2 = 7, remainder 1

7 ÷ 2 = 3, remainder 1

3 ÷ 2 = 1, remainder 1

1 ÷ 2 = 0, remainder 1

So, writing the remainders from last to first: 11111101000. Let me count the bits. Let's see:

Starting from the last division:

1 (2^10) = 1024

1 (2^9) = 512, total so far 1536

1 (2^8) = 256, total 1792

1 (2^7) = 128, total 1920

1 (2^6) = 64, total 1984

1 (2^5) = 32, total 2016

0 (2^4) = 0, remains 2016

1 (2^3) = 8, total 2024

0 (2^2), 0 (2^1), 0 (2^0)

Wait, that can't be right. Let me do it more carefully.

Wait, I think I messed up the powers. Let me write it down:

2024 in binary:

Let's compute the powers of 2:

2^0 = 1

2^1 = 2

2^2 =4

2^3=8

2^4=16

2^5=32

2^6=64

2^7=128

2^8=256

2^9=512

2^10=1024

2^11=2048 (which is more than 2024)

So, let's subtract 1024 from 2024: 2024-1024=1000.

Now, 512 is the next lower. 1000-512=488.

Next is 256: 488-256=232.

Next, 128: 232-128=104.

Next, 64: 104-64=40.

Next, 32: 40-32=8.

Now, 8 is 2^3. So, 8-8=0.

So, the bits set are at positions 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 3.

So, in binary, 2024 is 11111101000.

Wait, that's 11 bits: from 2^10 to 2^0.

So, the binary representation is 11111101000.

So, 2024 is equal to 2^10 + 2^9 + 2^8 + 2^7 + 2^6 + 2^5 + 2^3.

So, 2^10 is 1024, 2^9 is 512, 2^8 is 256, 2^7 is 128, 2^6 is 64, 2^5 is 32, 2^3 is 8.

Adding them together: 1024+512=1536, +256=1792, +128=1920, +64=1984, +32=2016, +8=2024.

So, the exponents where the bits are set are 3,5,6,7,8,9,10.

Wait, but in the binary representation, the rightmost bit is 2^0, so the positions are 0 to 10. So, the 1s are at positions 3,5,6,7,8,9,10.

Wait, so 2024 = sum_{k=3,5,6,7,8,9,10} 2^k.

Hmm. So, how does this relate to our problem?

Earlier, we had that the sum over m in A of 2^{m-1} equals 2024.

So, sum_{m in A} 2^{m-1} = 2024.

Which is equal to sum_{k in K} 2^k, where K is a set of exponents.

Wait, in this case, 2024 is already a sum of powers of two. So, perhaps A is such that m-1 is each of the exponents in the binary representation.

So, the exponents in 2024's binary form are 3,5,6,7,8,9,10. So, m-1 must be these exponents.

Thus, m = 4,6,7,8,9,10,11.

Wait, let me see:

For each term 2^{m-1} in the sum, m-1 must be one of the exponents in the binary representation of 2024. Because 2024 is a sum of distinct powers of two, so each 2^{m-1} must correspond to one of those exponents.

Therefore, m-1 can be 3,5,6,7,8,9,10, so m is 4,6,7,8,9,10,11.

So, A = {4,6,7,8,9,10,11}.

Therefore, the sum of the elements of A is 4+6+7+8+9+10+11.

Let me compute that:

4+6=10

10+7=17

17+8=25

25+9=34

34+10=44

44+11=55.

So, the sum is 55.

Wait, but I should verify that this is indeed the case.

So, A = {4,6,7,8,9,10,11}

For each m in A, 2^{m-1} is 2^3=8, 2^5=32, 2^6=64, 2^7=128, 2^8=256, 2^9=512, 2^10=1024.

Sum these up: 8 +32=40, +64=104, +128=232, +256=488, +512=1000, +1024=2024.

Yep, that adds up to 2024. So, that's correct.

Therefore, the sum of elements in A is 55.

Wait, but hold on a second. Are there other possible sets A that could sum up to 2024 in the same way? Because 2024 is a sum of distinct powers of two, so the only way to express it as a sum of 2^{m-1} terms is if each m-1 is a unique exponent in the binary representation, i.e., each m-1 is unique and corresponds to a bit set in 2024.

Therefore, A must consist of the numbers m where m-1 are the exponents where 2^{m-1} is present in the sum. So, indeed, the only possible A is {4,6,7,8,9,10,11}. There are no other possibilities because if there were, the sum would include other exponents, which would change the total.

Wait, but wait another thought. Suppose A has elements that are not in the set I found. Could they also sum to 2024? For example, what if A has some elements where 2^{m-1} are not in the binary representation? But since 2024 is a sum of distinct powers of two, any other 2^{m-1} would have to be included as a separate term, but if 2024 doesn't have that power, that can't happen. So, no, there's no alternative set A that can sum up to 2024, because 2024 is a unique combination of powers of two.

Therefore, the sum of the elements of A is 55.

Alice selects a set \( A \) of positive integers. Bob then lists all finite nonempty sets \( B \) where the maximum element of \( B \) is in \( A \). The number of such sets \( B \) is 2024. We need to determine the sum of the elements in \( A \).

For each element \( m \) in \( A \), the number of sets \( B \) with maximum \( m \) is \( 2^{m-1} \). Therefore, the total number of sets \( B \) is the sum of \( 2^{m-1} \) for all \( m \) in \( A \):

\[
\sum_{m \in A} 2^{m-1} = 2024.
\]

Expressing 2024 in binary, we find it is \( 11111101000_2 \), which corresponds to the sum of powers of two:

\[
2024 = 2^{10} + 2^9 + 2^8 + 2^7 + 2^6 + 2^5 + 2^3.
\]

Thus, the exponents \( m-1 \) in the sum must be 3, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, and 10. Therefore, the elements of \( A \) are:

\[
A = \{4, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11\}.
\]

Summing these elements:

\[
4 + 6 + 7 + 8 + 9 + 10 + 11 = 55.
\]

The sum of the elements of \( A \) is \(\boxed{55}\).
