Okay, so I have this geometry problem here, and I need to find the length of AP in the given triangle setup. Let me try to visualize the problem and figure out the steps I need to take.

First, the problem says that triangle ABC is inscribed in a circle ω. The tangents to ω at points B and C intersect at point D. Then, the line AD intersects the circle ω again at point P. We're given the side lengths: AB is 5, BC is 9, and AC is 10. We need to find AP expressed as a reduced fraction m/n and then compute m + n.

Hmm, let me draw a rough sketch in my mind. Triangle ABC with AB=5, BC=9, and AC=10. The circle ω is the circumcircle of ABC. The tangents at B and C meet at D, so D is the ex-pole or something related to the tangents. Then, drawing AD and seeing where it intersects ω again at P.

I remember that when two tangents are drawn from a point to a circle, that point is called the ex-pole, and the lengths of the tangents from that point to the circle are equal. So, DB and DC should be equal because they're both tangents from D to ω.

Wait, but in this case, the tangents are at B and C, so D is the point where the two tangents meet. So yes, DB = DC.

I think the first step is to find some key properties of triangle ABC. Since I'm given all three sides, maybe I can compute some angles or maybe find the circumradius. That might help because points related to the circumcircle are involved.

Let me compute the semiperimeter (s) of triangle ABC to see if it's a Heronian triangle or not. s = (5 + 9 + 10)/2 = 24/2 = 12.

Now, using Heron's formula, the area (Δ) is sqrt[s(s - AB)(s - BC)(s - AC)] = sqrt[12*(12-5)*(12-9)*(12-10)] = sqrt[12*7*3*2] = sqrt[504] = sqrt[16*31.5] but wait, 504 factors: 504 = 16 * 31.5, but that's not helpful. Let me compute it numerically. 12*7=84, 3*2=6, so 84*6=504. So sqrt(504) = sqrt(16*31.5) but perhaps I can factor it as 504 = 72 * 7, so sqrt(504) = sqrt(72 * 7) = sqrt(36 * 2 * 7) = 6 * sqrt(14). So the area is 6√14.

Now, since the area is 6√14, I can find the circumradius R using the formula:

Δ = (a b c) / (4 R)

Where a, b, c are the sides. So, R = (a b c) / (4Δ).

Let me compute that:

a = 5, b = 9, c =10.

So, a*b*c = 5*9*10 = 450.

4Δ = 4*(6√14) = 24√14.

Thus, R = 450 / (24√14) = (450)/(24√14).

Simplify 450/24: Divide numerator and denominator by 6: 450 ÷6=75, 24 ÷6=4. So 75/(4√14). Rationalizing the denominator: multiply numerator and denominator by √14:

(75√14)/(4*14) = (75√14)/56.

So R = 75√14 / 56. Hmm, that's the circumradius.

Alternatively, maybe I can find coordinates for the triangle and compute the necessary points. That might be a bit involved, but perhaps manageable.

Alternatively, maybe use power of a point. Since D is the intersection of the two tangents, the power of point D with respect to circle ω is DB² = DC² = DP * DA, since AD intersects the circle at A and P. Wait, actually, power of a point says that for point D outside the circle, the square of the tangent is equal to the product of the lengths from D to the intersection points on a secant. So, DB² = DP * DA.

Wait, so DB² = DP * DA.

Our goal is to find AP, which is equal to DP - DA? Wait, no. Wait, AP is the length from A to P. So, if AD intersects the circle again at P, then AP is equal to DP - DA? Wait, no, because AP is from A to P, which is a segment on AD. So, if we let AD = x, then AP would be the distance from A to P, which is less than AD. Alternatively, if I denote AP as y, then PD would be AD - AP = x - y. But according to power of a point, DB² = DP * DA, so DB² = (x - y) * x.

But perhaps I can find DB in terms of other known quantities. Since D is the intersection of the two tangents, and in triangle ABC, maybe triangle DBC is something we can compute.

Wait, but perhaps using coordinates would help. Let me try to assign coordinate system to this problem.

Let me place point C at the origin (0,0), point A at (10,0) because AC is 10 units. Then point B is somewhere in the plane. I can compute the coordinates of B using the distances AB=5 and BC=9.

So, point C is (0,0), point A is (10,0). Let me denote point B as (x,y). Then, the distance from B to C is 9, so sqrt(x² + y²) = 9. The distance from B to A is 5, so sqrt( (x -10)^2 + y^2 ) =5.

So, we have two equations:

1. x² + y² = 81

2. (x -10)^2 + y² = 25

Subtracting equation 1 from equation 2:

(x -10)^2 + y^2 - x² - y^2 = 25 -81 ⇒ (x² -20x +100) -x² = -56 ⇒ -20x +100 = -56 ⇒ -20x = -156 ⇒ x = 156/20 = 39/5 = 7.8.

So x is 7.8, which is 39/5.

Now, plug x back into equation 1 to find y:

(39/5)^2 + y² = 81 ⇒ (1521/25) + y² = 81 ⇒ y² = 81 - (1521/25) = (2025/25 - 1521/25) = 504/25 ⇒ y = sqrt(504/25) = (sqrt(504))/5.

Simplify sqrt(504):

504 = 16 * 31.5? Wait, wait, 504 ÷16 is 31.5, which isn't a perfect square. Let's factor 504 properly.

504 = 16 * 31.5 is not correct. Let me factor 504:

504 ÷ 2 = 252

252 ÷ 2 =126

126 ÷2=63

63 ÷3=21

21 ÷3=7

So, 504 = 2^3 * 3^2 *7^1.

So sqrt(504) = sqrt(2^3 * 3^2 *7) = 2^(1.5) * 3 * sqrt(7) = 2*sqrt(2) *3 *sqrt(7) = 6*sqrt(14).

Wait, because sqrt(2^3) is 2*sqrt(2), sqrt(3^2)=3, sqrt(7)=sqrt(7). So altogether, 2*3*sqrt(2*7) =6*sqrt(14).

So, y = (6√14)/5.

Thus, point B is at (39/5, 6√14/5).

Now, we have coordinates for A (10,0), B (39/5, 6√14/5), and C (0,0).

Now, we need to find point D, which is the intersection of tangents at B and C to the circumcircle ω of triangle ABC.

I remember that the tangent to a circle at a point is perpendicular to the radius at that point. So, the tangent at B is perpendicular to the radius OB, where O is the circumcenter.

Similarly, the tangent at C is perpendicular to the radius OC.

So, perhaps I need to find the circumcenter O of triangle ABC.

Since we have coordinates for A, B, and C, I can compute the circumcenter O by finding the perpendicular bisectors of two sides and finding their intersection.

Let me compute the midpoints and slopes needed for the perpendicular bisectors.

First, the midpoint of AB and the midpoint of AC.

Wait, but perhaps it's better to compute the perpendicular bisectors of AB and AC.

Wait, but maybe I can compute the perpendicular bisectors of AB and BC, or any two sides.

Let me choose AB and AC.

Wait, but let's compute the perpendicular bisector of AB.

Point A is (10,0), point B is (39/5, 6√14/5).

Midpoint of AB is ((10 + 39/5)/2, (0 + 6√14/5)/2).

Compute 10 as 50/5, so 50/5 +39/5=89/5, divided by 2: 89/10.

Similarly, the y-coordinate is (6√14/5)/2 = 3√14/5.

So the midpoint is (89/10, 3√14/5).

Now, the slope of AB is (yB - yA)/(xB - xA) = (6√14/5 - 0)/(39/5 -10) = (6√14/5)/(39/5 -50/5) = (6√14/5)/(-11/5) = -6√14/11.

So the slope of AB is -6√14/11. The perpendicular bisector will have a slope that's the negative reciprocal, so 11/(6√14).

Similarly, let's compute the perpendicular bisector of AC.

Point A is (10,0), point C is (0,0). Midpoint of AC is (5,0).

The slope of AC is (0 -0)/(0 -10)=0, so it's a horizontal line. So the perpendicular bisector will be a vertical line through (5,0), which is x=5.

Therefore, the perpendicular bisector of AC is x=5.

Now, the perpendicular bisector of AB has the midpoint at (89/10, 3√14/5) and slope 11/(6√14). So let's write the equation of this line.

Using point-slope form: y - 3√14/5 = (11/(6√14))(x - 89/10).

Now, since the perpendicular bisectors intersect at O, we can find O by solving this equation along with x=5.

So, substitute x=5 into the equation:

y - 3√14/5 = (11/(6√14))(5 - 89/10).

Compute 5 - 89/10: 5 is 50/10, so 50/10 -89/10 = -39/10.

So:

y - 3√14/5 = (11/(6√14))*(-39/10).

Multiply that out:

11 * (-39) = -429.

Denominator: 6√14 * 10 = 60√14.

So:

y - 3√14/5 = (-429)/(60√14).

Simplify numerator and denominator:

Divide numerator and denominator by 3: 429 ÷3=143, 60 ÷3=20.

So it becomes (-143)/(20√14).

Now, rationalize the denominator:

(-143)/(20√14) = (-143√14)/(20*14) = (-143√14)/280.

So:

y = 3√14/5 + (-143√14)/280.

Let me convert 3√14/5 to a denominator of 280:

3√14/5 = (3√14 *56)/280 = 168√14/280.

So:

y = (168√14 -143√14)/280 = (25√14)/280 = (5√14)/56.

So the circumcenter O is at (5, 5√14/56).

Wait, let me double-check that calculation for y. Because:

Starting from:

y = 3√14/5 - 143√14/(280).

Express 3√14/5 as (3√14 * 56)/280 = 168√14/280.

So, 168√14/280 -143√14/280 = (168 -143)√14 /280 =25√14/280 =5√14/56. Yes, that's correct.

So, O is at (5,5√14/56).

Now, we can find the equation of the tangent at point B. Since the tangent at B is perpendicular to the radius OB.

The slope of OB is (yB - yO)/(xB - xO).

Point B is (39/5, 6√14/5), point O is (5,5√14/56).

So, xB - xO = 39/5 -5 = 39/5 -25/5=14/5.

yB - yO = 6√14/5 -5√14/56.

Let me compute this:

Express both terms with denominator 280.

6√14/5 = (6√14 *56)/280 = 336√14/280.

5√14/56 = (5√14 *5)/280 =25√14/280.

So, yB - yO = 336√14/280 -25√14/280 =311√14/280.

So the slope of OB is (311√14/280) / (14/5) = (311√14/280) * (5/14) = (311√14 *5)/(280*14) =1555√14/(3920).

Simplify 1555 and 3920.

Hmm, 1555 ÷5=311, 3920 ÷5=784. So, 311√14/(784).

So, the slope of OB is 311√14/784.

Therefore, the tangent at B is perpendicular to this, so its slope is the negative reciprocal.

So slope_tangent_at_B = -784/(311√14).

We can rationalize this if needed, but maybe it's fine for now.

Similarly, the tangent at C is perpendicular to the radius OC.

Point C is at (0,0), point O is at (5,5√14/56).

So, the slope of OC is (5√14/56 -0)/(5 -0) = (5√14/56)/5 = √14/56.

Thus, the tangent at C is perpendicular to OC, so its slope is the negative reciprocal: -56/√14.

Simplify: -56/√14 = -56√14/(14) = -4√14.

So, the tangent at C has slope -4√14.

Now, equation of tangent at C: since it passes through C (0,0), its equation is y = -4√14 x.

Similarly, equation of tangent at B: passes through B (39/5, 6√14/5), with slope -784/(311√14).

So, let's write the equation:

y - 6√14/5 = (-784/(311√14))(x -39/5).

That's a bit complicated, but maybe I can work with it.

Now, the point D is the intersection of the two tangents: tangent at B and tangent at C.

We have the equations:

1. y = -4√14 x (tangent at C)

2. y = (-784/(311√14))(x -39/5) + 6√14/5 (tangent at B)

Let me substitute y from equation 1 into equation 2.

So:

-4√14 x = (-784/(311√14))(x -39/5) +6√14/5.

Let me multiply both sides by 311√14 to eliminate denominators:

-4√14 x *311√14 = -784 (x -39/5) + (6√14/5)*311√14.

Compute each term:

Left-hand side: -4√14 *311√14 x = -4*311*(√14)^2 x = -4*311*14 x = -4*4354 x = -17416 x.

Right-hand side:

First term: -784(x - 39/5) = -784x + (784*39)/5.

Compute 784*39: Let's compute 700*39=27300, 84*39=3276, so total 27300+3276=30576. So, (30576)/5 = 6115.2.

Second term: (6√14/5)*311√14 = 6*311*(√14)^2 /5 = 6*311*14 /5.

Compute 6*311=1866; 1866*14=26124. 26124 /5=5224.8.

So, right-hand side becomes:

-784x +6115.2 +5224.8 = -784x + (6115.2 +5224.8) = -784x + 11340.

So, the equation is:

-17416x = -784x +11340.

Bring the -784x to left:

-17416x +784x =11340 ⇒ (-17416 +784)x =11340 ⇒ (-16632)x=11340.

Thus, x=11340/(-16632).

Simplify this fraction.

First, note that both numerator and denominator are divisible by 12.

11340 ÷12=945, 16632 ÷12=1386.

So, x=945/(-1386).

Simplify further: divide numerator and denominator by 3.

945 ÷3=315, 1386 ÷3=462.

x=315/(-462).

Again, divide by 3: 315 ÷3=105, 462 ÷3=154.

x=105/(-154).

Check if 105 and 154 have a common factor.

154=14*11, 105=15*7. 105 and 154 share a factor of 7? 105 ÷7=15, 154 ÷7=22. So, yes.

So, x= (15*(-7))/(22*(-7)) → Wait, wait: 105/(-154) = (15*7)/(-22*7) )= (15)/(-22) = -15/22.

So, x= -15/22.

Now, substitute x into equation 1 (y= -4√14 x) to find y.

y= -4√14*(-15/22)= (60√14)/22 = (30√14)/11.

So, point D is at (-15/22, 30√14/11).

Now, I need to find point P where line AD intersects the circumcircle ω again.

Point A is at (10,0), point D is at (-15/22, 30√14/11).

So, let's find the parametric equation of line AD.

Parametric equations can be written as:

x = 10 + t*( (-15/22 -10) ) = 10 + t*( (-15/22 - 220/22) ) =10 + t*(-235/22)

y= 0 + t*(30√14/11 -0 )= t*(30√14/11)

So, x=10 - (235/22) t

y= (30√14/11) t

Now, this line intersects the circumcircle ω again at point P. The circumcircle has center O (5,5√14/56) and radius R=75√14/56.

The equation of ω is (x -5)^2 + (y -5√14/56)^2 = (75√14/56)^2.

We can substitute the parametric equations into this equation to find the parameter t values where AD intersects ω.

Plugging x and y into the circle equation:

[ (10 - (235/22)t -5 )^2 + ( (30√14/11) t -5√14/56 )^2 ] = (75√14/56)^2.

Simplify each term.

First, compute (10 -5) =5, so first term is (5 - (235/22) t)^2.

Second term: (30√14/11 t -5√14/56)^2.

Let's compute each part step by step.

First term:

(5 - (235/22) t)^2 = [5 - (235/22)t]^2 = 25 - 2*5*(235/22) t + (235/22)^2 t^2

=25 - (2350/22) t + (55225/484) t^2.

Second term:

(30√14/11 t -5√14/56)^2.

Factor out √14:

= (√14 (30/11 t -5/56 ))^2 =14*(30/11 t -5/56)^2.

Compute inside the square:

30/11 t -5/56 = (30*56 t -5*11)/(11*56) )= (1680 t -55)/(616).

So, the term becomes 14*( (1680 t -55)^2 )/(616)^2.

Simplify 14 and 616: 616=14*44, so 14/(616)^2 =1/(44*616).

Wait, maybe it's better to compute as is.

Wait, let's compute the square:

(30/11 t -5/56)^2 = (30/11 t)^2 - 2*(30/11 t)*(5/56) + (5/56)^2.

= (900/121) t² - (300/616) t +25/(56²).

Simplify each term:

300/616 can be reduced. 300 and 616 are both divisible by 4: 300 ÷4=75, 616 ÷4=154. So, 75/154.

So, second term is (900/121) t² - (75/154) t +25/(3136).

Then, multiply by 14:

14*(900/121 t²) = (12600/121) t²

14*(-75/154 t) = (-1050/154) t = (-525/77) t, which simplifies to (-525 ÷7)/(77 ÷7)= (-75/11) t.

14*(25/3136) = (350)/3136 = 350 ÷14=25, 3136 ÷14=224. So, 25/224.

So, the second term becomes:

(12600/121) t² - (75/11) t +25/224.

Now, putting it all together, the entire equation is:

[25 - (2350/22)t + (55225/484) t²] + [ (12600/121) t² - (75/11) t +25/224 ] = (75√14/56)^2.

Compute the right-hand side: (75√14/56)^2 = (75^2 *14)/(56^2) = (5625 *14)/(3136) = (78750)/(3136).

Simplify 78750/3136: Let's see if both are divisible by 2: 78750/2=39375, 3136/2=1568. Again, 39375 and 1568: 39375 ÷ 7=5625, 1568 ÷7=224. Wait, 1568 ÷7=224? 7*224=1568. Yes. So, 39375 ÷7=5625, 1568 ÷7=224.

So, 78750/3136= (5625 *14)/(3136) → Wait, no, right-hand side is 78750/3136, which simplifies by dividing numerator and denominator by 14: 78750 ÷14=5625, 3136 ÷14=224. So, 5625/224.

So, the equation becomes:

25 - (2350/22)t + (55225/484) t² + (12600/121) t² - (75/11)t +25/224 =5625/224.

Let me combine like terms.

First, t² terms:

55225/484 +12600/121.

Convert to common denominator. 484 is 22², 121 is 11²=121, which is 484/4. So, 12600/121 = (12600*4)/484 =50400/484.

So, 55225/484 +50400/484= (55225 +50400)/484=105625/484.

Next, t terms:

-2350/22 t -75/11 t.

Convert to common denominator, which is 22.

-2350/22 t - (75/11 t)*(2/2)= -2350/22 t -150/22 t = -(2350 +150)/22 t = -2500/22 t = -1250/11 t.

Constant terms:

25 +25/224.

Convert 25 to 224 denominator: 25=5600/224. So, 5600/224 +25/224=5625/224.

So, combining all terms, the equation is:

(105625/484) t² - (1250/11) t +5625/224 =5625/224.

Subtract 5625/224 from both sides:

(105625/484) t² - (1250/11) t =0.

Factor out t:

t [ (105625/484) t -1250/11 ] =0.

So, solutions are t=0 and t= (1250/11)/(105625/484).

t=0 corresponds to point A (10,0), so the other solution is t= (1250/11) * (484/105625).

Compute this:

1250 *484 = ?

Well, 1250 *484 = 1250*(400 +80 +4) = 1250*400=500,000; 1250*80=100,000; 1250*4=5,000. So total 500k+100k=600k+5k=605,000.

Denominator: 11*105625=1,161,875.

So, t=605000 / 1,161,875.

Simplify the fraction.

Divide numerator and denominator by 25: 605000 ÷25=24,200; 1,161,875 ÷25=46,475.

24,200/46,475.

Check if both are divisible by 5: 24,200 ÷5=4,840; 46,475 ÷5=9,295.

4,840/9,295. Check divisibility by 5: 4,840 ÷5=968; 9,295 ÷5=1,859.

968/1859. Let's check if 968 and 1859 have a common factor.

Divide 1859 by 968: 1859=968*1 + 891.

Then, 968 ÷891=1 + 77.

891 ÷77=11*77=847. 891-847=44.

77 ÷44=1 +33.

44 ÷33=1 +11.

33 ÷11=3.

So, GCD is 11.

Wait, wait, let me compute GCD(968,1859):

Compute GCD(1859,968):

1859 ÷968 =1 with remainder 891.

GCD(968,891).

968 ÷891=1 with remainder 77.

GCD(891,77).

891 ÷77=11*77=847, remainder 44.

GCD(77,44).

77 ÷44=1, rem 33.

GCD(44,33).

44 ÷33=1, rem 11.

GCD(33,11)=11.

So, GCD is 11.

So, 968 ÷11= 88, 1859 ÷11=169.

So, 968/1859=88/169.

So, t=88/169.

Wait, wait, let me retrace:

We started with t=605000 /1,161,875.

Divided numerator and denominator by 25: 24,200 /46,475.

Then by 5: 4,840 /9,295.

Then by 5 again: 968/1,859.

Wait, wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the denominator earlier.

Wait, 1,161,875 ÷25 is 46,475, correct. Then, 46,475 ÷5=9,295. Correct.

Wait, 1,161,875 ÷25=46,475.

Then, 46,475 ÷5=9,295.

Then, 9,295 ÷5=1,859.

So, 605000 /1,161,875 = (605000 ÷25 ÷5 ÷5) / (1,161,875 ÷25 ÷5 ÷5) =24,200/46,475 =4,840/9,295=968/1,859.

Then, GCD(968,1859)=11, so 968/1,859=88/169.

So, t=88/169.

Thus, the parameter t for point P is 88/169.

Now, using the parametric equations for AD:

x=10 - (235/22) t =10 - (235/22)(88/169).

Similarly, y= (30√14/11) t = (30√14/11)(88/169).

Compute x:

Compute (235/22)*(88/169): 235 and 88: 235=5*47, 88=8*11. 22=2*11. So, 235/22 *88/169 = (235 *88)/(22*169).

Simplify 88/22=4. So, =235 *4 /169=940/169.

So, x=10 -940/169. Convert 10 to 1690/169: 10=1690/169. So, x=1690/169 -940/169=750/169.

Similarly, y=(30√14/11)*(88/169)= (30*88√14)/(11*169).

Simplify 88/11=8, so:

=30*8√14 /169=240√14/169.

Thus, point P is at (750/169, 240√14/169).

Now, we need to find AP.

Point A is at (10,0), point P is at (750/169,240√14/169).

Compute the distance between A (10,0) and P (750/169,240√14/169).

Use distance formula:

AP = sqrt[ (10 -750/169)^2 + (0 -240√14/169)^2 ].

Compute each term:

10 -750/169 = (1690/169 -750/169)=940/169.

So, (940/169)^2.

Second term: (240√14/169)^2 = (240^2 *14)/(169^2).

Compute 240^2=57,600. So, 57,600 *14=806,400.

So, (240√14/169)^2=806,400/(169^2).

Now, compute the first square: (940)^2= (900 +40)^2=900² +2*900*40 +40²=810,000 +72,000 +1,600=883,600.

So, (940/169)^2=883,600/(169^2).

So, AP^2=883,600/(169²) +806,400/(169²)= (883,600 +806,400)/169²=1,690,000/(169²).

Simplify 1,690,000/(169²).

Note that 169²=28,561.

1,690,000 =169 *10,000.

So, 169*10,000 / (169²)=10,000/169.

Thus, AP^2=10,000/169 ⇒ AP=100/13.

So, AP is 100/13, which is in reduced form because 100 and 13 are coprime (13 is prime, doesn't divide 100).

Therefore, m=100, n=13, so m +n=113.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To solve the problem, we start by noting that triangle \(ABC\) has sides \(AB = 5\), \(BC = 9\), and \(AC = 10\). Using Heron's formula, we calculate the area of the triangle and then find the circumradius \(R\). The circumradius \(R\) is found to be \(\frac{75\sqrt{14}}{56}\).

Next, we place the triangle in a coordinate system with \(C\) at the origin \((0,0)\), \(A\) at \((10,0)\), and determine the coordinates of \(B\) as \(\left(\frac{39}{5}, \frac{6\sqrt{14}}{5}\right)\). Using the perpendicular bisectors of \(AB\) and \(AC\), we find the circumcenter \(O\) at \(\left(5, \frac{5\sqrt{14}}{56}\right)\).

We then find the equations of the tangents at \(B\) and \(C\) to the circumcircle. The intersection of these tangents gives the point \(D\), which is calculated to be \(\left(-\frac{15}{22}, \frac{30\sqrt{14}}{11}\right)\).

Using parametric equations, we determine the line \(AD\) and find its intersection with the circumcircle again at point \(P\). By solving the parametric equations with the circumcircle's equation, we find the parameter \(t\) corresponding to \(P\). Substituting \(t = \frac{88}{169}\) into the parametric equations, we find the coordinates of \(P\) as \(\left(\frac{750}{169}, \frac{240\sqrt{14}}{169}\right)\).

Finally, we calculate the distance \(AP\) using the distance formula. The result is \(AP = \frac{100}{13}\), leading to \(m = 100\) and \(n = 13\), so \(m + n = 113\).

\(\boxed{113}\)
