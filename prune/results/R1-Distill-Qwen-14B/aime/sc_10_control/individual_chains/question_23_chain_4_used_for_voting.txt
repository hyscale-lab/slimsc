Okay, so I have this problem about a hyperbola and a rhombus. Let me read it again:

We have points A, B, C, D on the hyperbola x²/20 - y²/24 = 1. These points form a rhombus ABCD, and the diagonals intersect at the origin. We need to find the greatest real number that is less than BD² for all such rhombi. So, essentially, we're looking for the supremum (the least upper bound) of BD² as we vary the rhombus on the hyperbola.

Hmm, okay. Let me start by recalling some properties. A rhombus is a quadrilateral with all sides equal, and its diagonals bisect each other at right angles? Wait, no, that's a square. Actually, in a rhombus, the diagonals bisect each other at any angle, but they are perpendicular. So, wait, no, correction: In a rhombus, the diagonals are not necessarily perpendicular, but in a square, which is a special case of a rhombus, they are.

Wait, no, actually, in a rhombus, the diagonals are perpendicular. Yeah, I think that's correct. So, in a rhombus, the diagonals are perpendicular bisectors of each other. So, since the diagonals intersect at the origin, that means the origin is the midpoint of both diagonals.

So, points A, B, C, D are on the hyperbola, and they form a rhombus. The diagonals AC and BD intersect at the origin. So, if O is the origin, then OA = OC and OB = OD. Since it's a rhombus, all sides are equal, so AB = BC = CD = DA.

Given that, I should probably parametrize the points. Maybe I can represent points A and C as (x, y) and (-x, -y), since the origin is the midpoint. Similarly, points B and D would be (p, q) and (-p, -q).

Wait, but in a rhombus, the diagonals are perpendicular. So, the product of their slopes is -1. So, if AC has slope m, then BD has slope -1/m.

But wait, AC is from (x, y) to (-x, -y), so its slope is ( -y - y ) / ( -x - x ) = (-2y)/(-2x) = y/x. So, the slope of AC is y/x. Therefore, the slope of BD should be -x/y.

But BD connects (p, q) to (-p, -q), so its slope is ( -q - q ) / ( -p - p ) = (-2q)/(-2p) = q/p. So, the slope of BD is q/p.

Since AC and BD are perpendicular, their slopes multiply to -1:

(y/x) * (q/p) = -1

So, (y q) / (x p) = -1

Which implies y q = -x p.

So, y q = -x p.

That's one equation.

Now, all four points A, B, C, D are on the hyperbola x²/20 - y²/24 = 1. So, substituting each into the hyperbola equation:

For point A: x²/20 - y²/24 = 1

For point B: p²/20 - q²/24 = 1

Similarly, points C and D are (-x, -y) and (-p, -q), which will satisfy the same equation since substituting (-x, -y) into the hyperbola equation gives x²/20 - y²/24 = 1, same as point A.

So, all four points satisfy the hyperbola equation, so we have two equations:

1. x²/20 - y²/24 = 1

2. p²/20 - q²/24 = 1

And from the slope condition, we have y q = -x p.

Additionally, since ABCD is a rhombus, all sides are equal. So, the distance between A and B should equal the distance between B and C, etc.

So, distance AB = distance BC = distance CD = distance DA.

Let me compute AB² and BC².

AB² = (p - x)² + (q - y)²

BC² = (-p - x)² + (-q - y)²

Wait, but that seems complicated. Maybe there's a better way.

Alternatively, since the sides are equal, all sides must have the same length.

But perhaps an easier approach is to use vectors.

Let me denote vectors OA = (x, y), OB = (p, q). Then, vector AB = OB - OA = (p - x, q - y). Similarly, vector BC = OC - OB = (-x - p, -y - q). Since ABCD is a rhombus, |AB| = |BC|.

So, |AB|² = |BC|².

Compute |AB|²: (p - x)² + (q - y)²

Compute |BC|²: (-x - p)^2 + (-y - q)^2 = (x + p)^2 + (y + q)^2

Set them equal:

(p - x)² + (q - y)² = (p + x)^2 + (q + y)^2

Expanding both sides:

Left: p² - 2px + x² + q² - 2qy + y²

Right: p² + 2px + x² + q² + 2qy + y²

Subtract left from right:

( p² + 2px + x² + q² + 2qy + y² ) - ( p² - 2px + x² + q² - 2qy + y² ) = 0

Simplify:

4px + 4qy = 0

Divide both sides by 4:

px + qy = 0

So, px + qy = 0.

But earlier, from the slopes, we had y q = -x p. Which is the same as px + qy = 0. So, that's consistent.

So, that's another equation.

So, so far, we have:

1. x²/20 - y²/24 = 1

2. p²/20 - q²/24 = 1

3. px + qy = 0

We need to find BD². BD is the distance between points B and D, which are (p, q) and (-p, -q). So, BD² is (p - (-p))² + (q - (-q))² = (2p)^2 + (2q)^2 = 4p² + 4q² = 4(p² + q²).

So, BD² = 4(p² + q²). So, we need to find the supremum of 4(p² + q²) given the constraints.

So, our goal is to maximize p² + q² subject to the constraints.

We have three equations:

1. x²/20 - y²/24 = 1

2. p²/20 - q²/24 = 1

3. px + qy = 0

We have four variables: x, y, p, q.

We need to find the maximum of p² + q².

Hmm. Let's see. Perhaps we can express x and y in terms of p and q, or vice versa.

From equation 3: px + qy = 0 => y = (-px)/q, assuming q ≠ 0.

Wait, but if q=0, then from equation 2, p²/20 = 1 => p²=20. Then, from equation 3, px=0. So, either p=0 or x=0. But p²=20, so p≠0, so x=0. Then, from equation 1, 0 - y²/24=1 => y²=-24, which is impossible. So, q can't be zero. Similarly, if p=0, from equation 3, 0 + qy=0 => qy=0. If q=0, as before, leads to contradiction. If y=0, then from equation 1, x²/20=1 => x²=20. From equation 3, 0 + q*0=0, which holds. Then, from equation 2, p²/20 - 0=1 => p²=20. So, p=±√20. So, points B and D would be (√20,0) and (-√20, 0). Points A and C would be (0, ±√(-24)), but that's imaginary. So, y can't be zero either. So, neither p nor q can be zero. So, we can safely say that q ≠ 0, and hence y = (-px)/q.

So, let's substitute y = (-px)/q into equation 1.

Equation 1: x²/20 - y²/24 = 1

Substitute y:

x²/20 - [ ( (-p x)/q )² ] /24 = 1

Simplify:

x²/20 - (p² x²)/(24 q²) = 1

Factor out x²:

x² [ 1/20 - p²/(24 q²) ] = 1

So,

x² = 1 / [ 1/20 - p²/(24 q²) ] 

Similarly, equation 2 is p²/20 - q²/24=1.

So, let me write equation 2 as:

p²/20 = 1 + q²/24

So, p² = 20(1 + q²/24) = 20 + (20 q²)/24 = 20 + (5 q²)/6

So, p² = 20 + (5 q²)/6

Wait, so p² is expressed in terms of q².

Similarly, from equation 3, we have y = (-p x)/q.

So, let me substitute p² into the expression for x².

From equation 1:

x² = 1 / [ 1/20 - p²/(24 q²) ]

Substitute p² = 20 + (5 q²)/6:

x² = 1 / [ 1/20 - (20 + (5 q²)/6 ) / (24 q²) ]

Let's compute the denominator:

Denominator = 1/20 - [ (20 + (5 q²)/6 ) / (24 q²) ]

Let me compute each term:

First term: 1/20

Second term: (20 + (5 q²)/6 ) / (24 q²) 

Let me split the second term into two fractions:

= [20/(24 q²)] + [ (5 q²)/6 / (24 q²) ]

Simplify each part:

20/(24 q²) = (5)/(6 q²)

(5 q²)/(6 * 24 q²) = 5/(144)

So, the denominator is 1/20 - [5/(6 q²) + 5/144]

So, denominator = 1/20 - 5/(6 q²) - 5/144

So, putting it all together:

x² = 1 / [ 1/20 - 5/(6 q²) - 5/144 ]

This seems a bit complicated, but perhaps I can write all terms with a common denominator.

Let me compute the denominator:

1/20 - 5/(6 q²) -5/144

Let me find a common denominator for these terms. Let's see, the denominators are 20, 6 q², and 144.

The least common multiple (LCM) of 20 and 144 is 720. But since there's a q² in the denominator, perhaps it's better to write each term with denominator 720 q².

But let me think differently. Let me denote t = q². Then, denominator becomes:

1/20 - 5/(6 t) -5/144

So, let me express all terms in terms of t:

1/20 = 18 t / (720 t)  because 720/20=36, so 1/20=36 t/(720 t). Wait, maybe that's not the way. Alternatively, let me compute each term over 720 t:

1/20 = (36 t)/720 t

5/(6 t) = (600)/(720 t)

5/144 = (25 t)/720 t

Wait, this might not be the right approach. Alternatively, let me compute the denominator as:

Denominator = (1/20) - (5/(6 q²)) - (5/144)

Let me express all terms with denominator 720 q²:

1/20 = 36 q² / 720 q²

5/(6 q²) = 600 / 720 q²

5/144 = 25 q² / 720 q²

Wait, no, that's not correct. Let me think:

To express 1/20 as something over 720 q²:

Multiply numerator and denominator by 720 q²:

1/20 = (720 q² * 1) / (20 * 720 q²) )= 720 q² / (14400 q²)

Wait, 20 * 720 q² = 14400 q². Hmm, that seems messy.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to combine the terms:

Denominator = 1/20 - 5/(6 q²) -5/144

= (1/20 - 5/144) - 5/(6 q²)

Compute 1/20 - 5/144:

Find a common denominator, which is 360.

1/20 = 18/360

5/144 = 12.5/360

Wait, 5/144 = (5*2.5)/360 = 12.5/360? Wait, no.

Wait, 144 * 2.5 = 360, so 5/144 = (5 * 2.5)/360 = 12.5/360.

So, 1/20 -5/144 = 18/360 -12.5/360 = 5.5/360 = 11/720.

So, denominator = 11/720 - 5/(6 q²)

Therefore, x² = 1 / [11/720 - 5/(6 q²) ]

= 1 / [ (11 - 60/(q²)) / 720 ]

= 720 / (11 - 60/(q²))

So, x² = 720 / (11 - 60/(q²))

Hmm, so x² is expressed in terms of q². Let me denote t = q². Then,

x² = 720 / (11 - 60/t )

So, x² = 720 t / (11 t - 60 )

Similarly, since x² must be positive, the denominator 11 t -60 must be positive, because 720 t is positive (t is positive as it's q squared).

So, 11 t -60 > 0 => t > 60/11 ≈5.4545.

So, q² must be greater than 60/11.

So, that's a condition on t.

Now, we can express x² and p² in terms of t.

We had p² = 20 + (5 t)/6

And x² = 720 t / (11 t -60 )

Now, since points A and B are on the hyperbola, their coordinates must satisfy the hyperbola equation, but I think the main equations are already accounted for.

Wait, but perhaps we can find a relationship between x and p, or in terms of t.

Wait, another thought: since ABCD is a rhombus, the sides are equal, so the vectors OA and OB must satisfy certain conditions.

Alternatively, perhaps we can parametrize the points on the hyperbola.

For hyperbola x²/a² - y²/b² =1, parametrization can be done using hyperbolic functions: x = a secθ, y = b tanθ.

Alternatively, sometimes people use x = a cosh t, y = b sinh t, but that's for one branch.

Since hyperbola has two branches, but in this problem, the points could be on either branch.

Wait, but the hyperbola is x²/20 - y²/24 =1, so a²=20, a=2√5, b²=24, b=2√6.

So, parametrization could be x = a secθ, y = b tanθ, where θ is a parameter.

So, for point A, we can write:

x = a secθ = 2√5 secθ

y = b tanθ = 2√6 tanθ

Similarly, for point B, perhaps we can write another parameter, say φ.

But since in our case, the origin is the intersection point of the diagonals, which suggests that points A and C are reflections across the origin, as are B and D. So, for point C, it would be (-2√5 secθ, -2√6 tanθ). Similarly, point D would be (-p, -q), if point B is (p, q).

But I'm not sure if parametrizing with θ and φ will help here.

Alternatively, since we have expressions for x² and p² in terms of t, and t is q², perhaps we can relate x and p.

Wait, from equation 3: px + qy =0.

We had y = (-p x)/q.

So, substituting into equation 1, which we've already done.

Alternatively, perhaps we can express the rhombus condition in terms of vectors.

Since ABCD is a rhombus, vectors AB and AD have the same length and the angle between them is such that the sides are equal.

But maybe that's complicating things.

Wait, another idea: in a rhombus, the diagonals are perpendicular and bisect each other. So, since the diagonals intersect at the origin, and are perpendicular, the diagonals AC and BD are perpendicular vectors.

So, vectors AC and BD are perpendicular.

Wait, vector AC is from A to C, which is (-2x, -2y). Vector BD is from B to D, which is (-2p, -2q). So, the dot product of AC and BD should be zero.

So, (-2x)(-2p) + (-2y)(-2q) = 0

Which is 4xp + 4yq = 0

Divide both sides by 4: xp + y q = 0

Which is the same as equation 3 (since equation 3 is px + q y =0). So, that's consistent.

So, that doesn't give us any new information.

Alternative approach: Let's consider that in the rhombus, the diagonals are perpendicular and bisect each other.

Given that, the diagonals AC and BD are perpendicular. So, their dot product is zero.

But since AC is (x, y) to (-x, -y), which is vector (-2x, -2y). Similarly, BD is (p, q) to (-p, -q), vector (-2p, -2q).

So, their dot product is (-2x)(-2p) + (-2y)(-2q) =4xp +4yq=0 => xp + yq=0, which is again the same equation.

So, that's consistent.

So, perhaps the key is to parametrize in terms of t=q².

We have x² = 720 t / (11 t -60 )

p² =20 + (5 t)/6

So, BD²=4(p² + q²)=4(p² + t)

But p²=20 + (5t)/6, so BD²=4(20 + (5t)/6 + t )=4(20 + (11t)/6 )

So, BD²=4*(20 + (11t)/6 )=80 + (44 t)/6=80 + (22 t)/3

So, BD²=80 + (22/3) t

So, since BD² is a linear function of t, to find its maximum, we need to find the maximum possible t (q²) given the constraints.

But what's the maximum possible t?

We have t>60/11≈5.4545.

But how big can t get?

Wait, from equation 2: p²/20 - q²/24=1

p²=20 + (5 q²)/6=20 + (5 t)/6

So, p² must be positive, which it is as t>0.

But are there any other constraints on t?

Since x² must be positive, as we had earlier, 11 t -60>0 => t>60/11.

But also, from equation 1: x²/20 - y²/24=1

But y²= [ ( -p x ) / q ]²= (p² x² ) / q²= (p² / q² ) x²

So, equation1: x²/20 - (p² x²)/(24 q² )=1

Which can be written as x² [1/20 - p²/(24 q² ) ]=1

We already used that to express x² in terms of t.

But perhaps there's a condition on x² being positive, which we already have.

Wait, but maybe another way: Since x² must be real, the expression 720 t / (11 t -60 ) must be positive.

Since t>60/11, denominator is positive, numerator is positive, so x² is positive.

So, the only real constraint is t>60/11.

Wait, but as t increases, BD²=80 + (22/3) t increases without bound, right?

But that can't be, because the hyperbola only extends to infinity. So, maybe as t increases, p² increases, but does that mean BD² can be made as large as possible?

Wait, but the problem says "the greatest real number that is less than BD² for all such rhombi."

Wait, that suggests that BD² can get arbitrarily large, so the supremum is infinity? But the problem says "the greatest real number that is less than BD² for all such rhombi." So, maybe the question is not about the supremum, but the infimum? No, wait, the wording says "the greatest real number that is less than BD² for all such rhombi." So, that would be the infimum of BD², right?

Wait, no. If BD² can be made as large as possible, then the greatest number less than BD² for all rhombi would be negative infinity, which doesn't make sense. So, perhaps I made a mistake in assuming that t can go to infinity.

Wait, perhaps there's a constraint on t beyond t>60/11. Because as t increases, x² increases as well, but points A and B have to lie on the hyperbola.

Wait, no, the hyperbola extends to infinity, so points can be as far as possible.

Wait, but perhaps not. Let me check.

Wait, if t increases, then q² increases. From equation 2: p²=20 + (5t)/6. So, as t increases, p² increases. From equation 3: px + qy=0 => y = (-p x)/q. So, as t increases, q increases, but p also increases. So, x² is 720 t / (11 t -60 ). As t increases, denominator is ~11 t, numerator is ~720 t. So, x² ~720 t /11 t=720/11≈65.45.

So, as t approaches infinity, x² approaches 720/11≈65.45. So, x² approaches 65.45, but can't exceed that.

Wait, that's interesting. So, x² is bounded above by 720/11.

Because as t approaches infinity, x² approaches 720/11. So, x² cannot be larger than that.

So, the maximum x² can be is 720/11.

Similarly, for t approaching infinity, q² approaches infinity, but x² approaches 720/11.

So, in that case, BD²=80 + (22/3) t. As t approaches infinity, BD² approaches infinity.

But wait, but x² is bounded above, so t can't be infinity. Wait, but t is q², which is unbounded. Because as t increases, x² approaches 720/11, which is finite.

So, is t allowed to go to infinity?

Wait, perhaps not, because when t increases, point B is moving further away on the hyperbola, but point A is approaching a certain x².

Wait, but the hyperbola allows points to go to infinity, so t can be as large as possible, making BD² as large as possible.

But the problem says "the greatest real number that is less than BD² for all such rhombi."

Wait, that would be the infimum of BD², because if BD² can get arbitrarily large, then there's no upper bound, but the question is asking for the greatest number less than BD² for all rhombi.

Wait, that is, the question is looking for the infimum (greatest lower bound) of BD², because for all rhombi, BD² is greater than some number, and we need the greatest such number.

Wait, no, "greatest real number that is less than BD² for all such rhombi." So, for all rhombi, BD² > L, and we need the maximum L. So, it's the infimum of BD², which is the greatest lower bound.

But in our case, BD² can be as small as possible, but can it be made arbitrarily small?

Wait, let's see. Let's see what happens when t approaches 60/11 from above.

So, t approaches 60/11 (~5.4545). Then, x² approaches 720*(60/11)/(11*(60/11)-60)=720*(60/11)/(60-60)=720*(60/11)/0, which tends to infinity.

So, x² approaches infinity as t approaches 60/11 from above.

But x² is 720 t/(11 t -60). As t approaches 60/11 from above, denominator approaches zero, so x² approaches infinity.

So, as t approaches 60/11+, x² approaches infinity, which would make y² approach [ (p x )² ] / q².

Wait, from equation 3: y= (-p x)/q, so y²= (p² x²)/ q².

But p²=20 + (5 t)/6.

So, as t approaches 60/11+, x² approaches infinity, and p² approaches 20 + (5*(60/11))/6=20 + (300/11)/6=20 + 50/11≈20+4.545≈24.545.

So, p² approaches ~24.545, so p approaches sqrt(24.545)=~4.954.

And q² approaches 60/11≈5.4545, so q approaches sqrt(60/11)=~2.33.

So, y²= (p² x²)/q².

p² ~24.545, x² approaches infinity, q² ~5.4545.

So, y² ~ (24.545 /5.4545)*x² ~ (4.5)*x².

So, y² approaches infinity as x² approaches infinity.

So, point A is approaching infinity along the hyperbola as t approaches 60/11 from above.

But in that case, BD²=80 + (22/3) t.

As t approaches 60/11+, BD² approaches 80 + (22/3)*(60/11)=80 + (22*60)/(3*11)=80 + (1320)/(33)=80 + 40=120.

So, as t approaches 60/11 from above, BD² approaches 120.

On the other hand, as t increases beyond 60/11, x² approaches 720/11≈65.45, but t can go to infinity, making BD² go to infinity.

So, the minimal value of BD² is approaching 120 as t approaches 60/11 from above.

But wait, is BD² approaching 120, or is it approaching from above?

Wait, when t approaches 60/11+, BD² approaches 80 + (22/3)*(60/11)=80 + (22*60)/(33)=80 + (1320)/(33)=80 + 40=120.

So, as t approaches 60/11+, BD² approaches 120 from above.

Therefore, BD² can be made arbitrarily close to 120, but cannot be less than 120.

Wait, no. When t approaches 60/11 from above, BD² approaches 120. But for t>60/11, BD²>120.

So, BD² can be as close to 120 as possible, but cannot be less than 120.

Therefore, the infimum of BD² is 120, meaning BD² is always greater than 120.

So, the greatest real number that is less than BD² for all such rhombi is 120, because BD² is always greater than 120, but can get as close as desired to 120.

Hence, the answer is 120.

Wait, but let me confirm.

So, when t approaches 60/11 from above, BD² approaches 120.

So, BD² can be made as close to 120 as desired, but cannot be less than 120.

Hence, the greatest real number less than BD² for all such rhombi is 120.

So, the answer is 120.

But wait, let me think again. When t approaches 60/11+, BD² approaches 120. So, for any epsilon>0, there exists a rhombus with BD²=120 + epsilon.

But can BD² be exactly 120? Probably not, because t=60/11 would make the denominator in x² expression zero, leading to x² approaching infinity, which isn't possible. So, BD² approaches 120 but never actually reaches it.

Therefore, 120 is the infimum, and thus the greatest number less than BD² for all rhombi.

So, the answer is 120.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To solve the problem, we analyze the rhombus \(ABCD\) on the hyperbola \(\frac{x^2}{20} - \frac{y^2}{24} = 1\) with diagonals intersecting at the origin. The goal is to find the greatest real number less than \(BD^2\) for all such rhombi.

1. **Hyperbola and Rhombus Properties**:
   - Points \(A, B, C, D\) lie on the hyperbola, and diagonals \(AC\) and \(BD\) intersect at the origin.
   - The diagonals are perpendicular, so their slopes multiply to \(-1\).
   - The sides of the rhombus are equal, leading to the condition \(px + qy = 0\).

2. **Parametrization and Constraints**:
   - Using the hyperbola equation, we express \(x^2\) and \(p^2\) in terms of \(t = q^2\).
   - We derive \(BD^2 = 4(p^2 + q^2)\), which simplifies to \(BD^2 = 80 + \frac{22}{3}t\).

3. **Behavior as \(t\) Varies**:
   - As \(t\) approaches \(60/11\) from above, \(BD^2\) approaches \(120\).
   - For \(t > 60/11\), \(BD^2\) increases without bound.

4. **Conclusion**:
   - The infimum of \(BD^2\) is \(120\), as \(BD^2\) can be made arbitrarily close to \(120\) but never less than it.

Thus, the greatest real number less than \(BD^2\) for all such rhombi is \(\boxed{120}\).
