Okay, so I have this problem about counting the number of paths on an 8x8 grid. The paths need to be of length 16, which makes sense because an 8x8 grid has 8 rows and 8 columns, so from the lower left to the upper right, you have to move 8 times right and 8 times up, totaling 16 steps. 

But the catch here is that the paths must change direction exactly four times. Hmm, changing direction... so in grid paths, moving right or up are the two directions. So, a path changes direction when it switches from moving right to up or from up to right. 

Let me think about what exactly constitutes a direction change. Each time the path switches from moving in one direction to the other, that's a direction change. For example, if a path starts by moving right a few steps, then up, then right again, each switch is a direction change.

So, for the entire path, which is of length 16, we need exactly four direction changes. That means the path will alternate between moving right and up, but only four times. So, how does that translate into the number of runs?

Wait, runs. Oh right, in combinatorics, a run is a consecutive sequence of the same thing. So, if we have a path that alternates between right and up, each run is a consecutive sequence of right or up moves. 

Each time we change direction, we start a new run. So, if there are four direction changes, how many runs do we have? Let's see, starting with a run, each direction change adds a new run. So, direction changes = number of runs minus 1. 

Wait, no. Let's think. Suppose we have a path that starts with a run of right moves. Then, each direction change adds a new run. So, for example:

- 1 run: all rights then all ups, but that's only one direction change. Wait, no. Wait, starting with all rights, then all ups: that's one direction change. So, 1 direction change corresponds to 2 runs. Similarly, two direction changes would correspond to 3 runs. So, in general, the number of runs R is equal to the number of direction changes D + 1. So, if D=4, then R=5 runs. 

So, the path will have exactly 5 runs, alternating between right and up. But wait, in an 8x8 grid, the path must go from lower left (0,0) to upper right (8,8). So, the path will consist of some number of right moves (total 8) and some number of up moves (total 8). These moves are divided into runs. 

Since the path alternates between right and up, depending on whether it starts with right or up, the runs will be in the order R, U, R, U, etc. or U, R, U, R, etc. So, the number of runs must be odd, right? Because 5 runs would mean starting with R, then U, R, U, R. Or starting with U, R, U, R, U. 

Wait, 5 runs would be either 3 right runs and 2 up runs or 3 up runs and 2 right runs, depending on the starting direction. But in the grid, both starting with right or up are possible. So, do we have to account for both possibilities?

Wait, let's see. Let's suppose that the first run is right. Then, R, U, R, U, R. So, 3 right runs and 2 up runs. Alternatively, starting with up, U, R, U, R, U. So, 3 up runs and 2 right runs. So, both cases are possible. So, the total number of runs is 5, but they can be split into 3 of one direction and 2 of the other. 

So, for each case (starting with R or starting with U), we can compute the number of paths, and then add them together. 

But wait, does the grid allow for both starting directions? Let me think. Since the path goes from lower left to upper right, which is moving right and up. So, the starting direction can be either right or up. So, both possibilities are valid. So, we need to consider both cases.

So, the plan is:

1. Calculate the number of paths starting with a right move, having 5 runs, with exactly 4 direction changes (so, 5 runs). These runs would be R, U, R, U, R, totaling 3 R runs and 2 U runs.

2. Similarly, calculate the number of paths starting with an up move, having 5 runs, which would be U, R, U, R, U, totaling 3 U runs and 2 R runs.

3. Sum the results from both cases.

So, let me break it down.

First, case 1: starting with R, then the runs are R, U, R, U, R. So, 3 R runs and 2 U runs. 

We need to distribute the 8 R moves into 3 runs, each run having at least 1 R. Similarly, distribute the 8 U moves into 2 runs, each run having at least 1 U.

Similarly, for case 2: starting with U, the runs are U, R, U, R, U. So, 3 U runs and 2 R runs. So, distribute the 8 U into 3 runs and 8 R into 2 runs.

So, for each case, the number of ways is the number of ways to distribute the R's multiplied by the number of ways to distribute the U's.

In combinatorics, the number of ways to distribute n indistinct items into k distinct boxes, each with at least 1 item, is C(n-1, k-1). So, for each case:

Case 1: Starting with R.

Number of ways to split 8 R's into 3 runs: C(8-1,3-1) = C(7,2).

Similarly, number of ways to split 8 U's into 2 runs: C(8-1,2-1) = C(7,1).

So, total for case 1: C(7,2) * C(7,1).

Case 2: Starting with U.

Number of ways to split 8 U's into 3 runs: C(7,2).

Number of ways to split 8 R's into 2 runs: C(7,1).

So, total for case 2: same as case 1, C(7,2)*C(7,1).

Therefore, total number of paths is 2 * [C(7,2) * C(7,1)].

Wait, but hold on. Is that correct?

Wait, let me verify. Because the runs have to alternate, so for case 1, starting with R, the runs are R, U, R, U, R. So, each R run has at least 1 R, and each U run has at least 1 U.

So, the number of ways to break 8 R's into 3 runs is C(7,2), since we're putting 2 dividers in the 7 gaps between the R's. Similarly, 8 U's into 2 runs is C(7,1).

Similarly, case 2 is the same.

Therefore, each case contributes C(7,2)*C(7,1). So, total is 2 * C(7,2) * C(7,1).

Computing the values:

C(7,2) = 21,

C(7,1) = 7.

So, 2 * 21 *7 = 2*147=294.

Wait, but wait a second. I think I might have made a mistake here. Because each run has to be at least 1 step, but in the grid, it's possible to have more than one step in a run. So, the number of ways to split into runs is correct.

But let me think about the actual path.

Each run is a consecutive sequence of steps in one direction. So, for case 1, starting with R, the path is R... U... R... U... R...

Each ... represents a run. So, the first run is R, then U, and so on. 

The number of ways to arrange the R runs is the number of compositions of 8 into 3 parts, each at least 1, which is C(7,2). Similarly, for U runs, it's C(7,1).

So, that seems correct.

But wait, when we split the steps into runs, the order matters. So, for R runs, the lengths are r1, r2, r3, where r1 + r2 + r3 =8, each ri â‰¥1. The number of such compositions is C(8-1,3-1)=C(7,2)=21. Similarly, for U, it's 8 into 2 parts, which is 7.

So, for each case, 21 *7 =147, and since we have two cases (starting with R or U), total is 2*147=294.

But wait, but the problem says "exactly four direction changes", which would correspond to five runs, which we accounted for.

But wait, wait another thing. The problem is on an 8x8 grid, but the path is from lower left to upper right, which is 8 right and 8 up steps, so 16 steps in total. So, a path with 5 runs must have 4 direction changes.

So, the calculation seems correct, but let me think if there's another way to approach this.

Alternatively, perhaps the number of such paths is equal to the number of ways to arrange the runs, which is 2*(number of ways starting with R + starting with U). But since starting with R and starting with U are symmetric, and each contributes the same number, it's 2*(number of ways starting with R).

So, I think the calculation is correct.

Wait, but let me think about the number of direction changes. Suppose we have 5 runs. So, the number of direction changes is 4. So, that's correct.

Alternatively, another way to think about this is to model the path as a sequence of steps, where each step is either R or U. But since the direction changes exactly four times, the sequence must consist of alternating R and U blocks, with each block being at least length 1.

So, starting with R: R, U, R, U, R. So, three R blocks and two U blocks.

Similarly, starting with U: U, R, U, R, U. So, three U blocks and two R blocks.

So, in each case, the number of ways is the number of ways to partition the R steps into their respective blocks multiplied by the number of ways to partition the U steps into their respective blocks.

Since the partitions are independent, we can multiply them.

So, for starting with R, the number of R partitions is C(8-1,3-1)=C(7,2)=21, and U partitions is C(8-1,2-1)=C(7,1)=7. So, 21*7=147.

Similarly, for starting with U, the partitions are the same: C(7,2)*C(7,1)=147.

So, total is 147 + 147=294.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused because I remember that in similar problems, sometimes the starting direction is considered, but perhaps in this case, since the grid is square, both starting directions are equally valid and contribute the same amount, so we just double it.

So, putting it all together, I think the answer is 294.

But wait, let me cross-verify this.

Wait, I think another way to model this is to consider the number of ways to have 5 runs, starting with either R or U, and each run has at least one step.

So, the number of such paths is equal to 2*(number of compositions of 8 R's into 3 parts * number of compositions of 8 U's into 2 parts).

Which is exactly what I did earlier.

Alternatively, perhaps using generating functions or recursive methods, but I think the combinatorial approach is correct here.

So, the final answer would be 294.

Wait, but let me think again. Is there a possibility that the starting direction is fixed? For example, if the grid is 8x8, starting at lower left (0,0), moving to (8,8). So, the first step can be either right or up. So, both cases are possible, so I think we have to consider both. 

Wait, but in the examples shown in the problem statement, I don't know what those examples look like. But since the problem says "as in the examples shown below," but I don't have access to those examples. So, I have to proceed with the given information.

But in any case, I think the logic is correct: 5 runs, 4 direction changes, which can be either starting with R or starting with U, each case contributing 147, so total 294.

So, I'm confident that the answer is 294.

To solve the problem of counting the number of paths of length 16 on an 8x8 grid that change direction exactly four times, we analyze the structure of such paths. Each path must consist of 8 right (R) moves and 8 up (U) moves, alternating between R and U. 

A path with exactly four direction changes will have five runs of consecutive steps. These runs can either start with R or U, leading to two distinct cases:

1. **Starting with R**: The runs alternate as R, U, R, U, R. This requires distributing 8 R's into 3 runs and 8 U's into 2 runs. The number of ways to do this is:
   - For R's: \( \binom{7}{2} = 21 \) ways (compositions of 8 into 3 parts).
   - For U's: \( \binom{7}{1} = 7 \) ways (compositions of 8 into 2 parts).
   - Total for this case: \( 21 \times 7 = 147 \).

2. **Starting with U**: The runs alternate as U, R, U, R, U. This requires distributing 8 U's into 3 runs and 8 R's into 2 runs. The number of ways is the same as the first case:
   - For U's: \( \binom{7}{2} = 21 \) ways.
   - For R's: \( \binom{7}{1} = 7 \) ways.
   - Total for this case: \( 21 \times 7 = 147 \).

Since both starting directions are valid, we sum the results from both cases:

\[
\text{Total number of paths} = 147 + 147 = 294.
\]

Thus, the number of paths that change direction exactly four times is \(\boxed{294}\).
