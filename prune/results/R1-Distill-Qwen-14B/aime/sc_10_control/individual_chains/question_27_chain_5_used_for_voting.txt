Alright, so I'm trying to solve this problem about a torus and a sphere. Let me try to visualize what's going on here. 

First, the torus T is created by rotating a circle of radius 3 around an axis in its plane, and the distance from the center of the circle to the axis is 6. So, I remember that a torus can be described using two radii: the major radius R, which is the distance from the center of the tube to the center of the torus, and the minor radius r, which is the radius of the tube itself. In this case, R is 6 and r is 3. 

Next, there's a sphere S with radius 11. The torus can rest either on the inside or the outside of this sphere. When it's inside, it's tangent along a circle with radius r_i, and when it's outside, it's tangent along a circle with radius r_o. We're supposed to find the difference r_i - r_o and express it as a fraction m/n where m and n are coprime, then find m + n.

I think I need to find the radii of these tangent circles for both internal and external tangency. Let me break it down.

When the torus is inside the sphere, it's tangent along a circle. Similarly, when it's outside, it's tangent along another circle. The tangent circle's radius depends on the orientation and the distances involved.

Let me recall that the torus can be represented parametrically. The standard equation for a torus is (R - sqrt(x^2 + y^2))^2 + z^2 = r^2. But I'm not sure if I need the equation or if there's a geometric way to figure this out.

Wait, maybe I can think about the centers. The sphere has radius 11, and the torus has major radius 6 and minor radius 3. So, when the torus is resting inside the sphere, the center of the sphere must be aligned with the center of the torus. Or is that the case?

Hmm, actually, when two surfaces are tangent, their centers (if they are spheres or something similar) are aligned along the line connecting their centers. But the torus is a bit more complicated.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the points of tangency. For a sphere and a torus, the point where they touch should lie along the line connecting the centers of the sphere and the torus. But how do I find the circle along which they are tangent?

Alternatively, maybe I can model the torus as a surface of revolution. So, when the torus is inside the sphere, the sphere's center is at some distance from the torus's center. Similarly when it's outside.

Let me consider the internal tangent first. When the torus is inside the sphere, the sphere's surface touches the torus at a circle. The distance from the sphere's center to the torus's center should be equal to the sphere's radius minus the distance from the torus's center to the point of tangency on the torus.

But wait, the torus is a surface, so in 3D, the distance from the sphere's center to any point on the torus must be equal to the sphere's radius. So, the points of tangency lie on both the sphere and the torus.

Alternatively, perhaps I can model the torus as a surface in polar coordinates or something. Wait, maybe it's better to model the torus as the set of points where the distance from the center is such that the square of that distance is equal to (R ± sqrt(x^2 + y^2) )^2 + z^2, but I might be mixing things up.

Wait, let me clarify. The standard equation for a torus is:

(√(x² + y²) − R)² + z² = r²

Where R is the major radius, and r is the minor radius. So, in this case, R is 6 and r is 3.

So the equation is:

(√(x² + y²) − 6)² + z² = 9

Now, the sphere S has radius 11. Let's place the sphere's center at the origin for simplicity. So the equation of the sphere is x² + y² + z² = 11² = 121.

When the torus is inside the sphere, they are tangent along a circle. Similarly, when the torus is outside, they are tangent along another circle.

Wait, but when the torus is inside the sphere, the sphere is larger, so the torus is entirely inside except for the point(s) of tangency. Similarly, when it's outside, the torus is larger, and the sphere is inside.

Wait, no, the torus is fixed. It's either placed inside the sphere (so the sphere is outside the torus) or outside (the sphere is inside the torus). Hmm, maybe not. Wait, the problem says when T rests on the inside of S, it's internally tangent. So, when T is inside S, it's tangent internally, meaning S is larger. So S is outside, and T is inside, touching along a circle.

Similarly, when T is outside S, meaning S is inside T, and they are tangent externally.

So, perhaps in both cases, the centers are aligned along the axis of the torus.

Wait, the torus has an axis of revolution. Let me consider that axis as the z-axis for simplicity. So the torus is centered at the origin, and its axis is the z-axis. So the sphere is also centered at the origin? Or is the center of the sphere somewhere else?

Wait, the problem doesn't specify the position of the sphere relative to the torus. But in both cases (internal and external), they must be tangent along a circle. So I think that in both cases, the center of the sphere coincides with the center of the torus. Because otherwise, the circle of tangency wouldn't make sense.

Wait, no, because when the torus is inside the sphere, the sphere's center is at a certain distance, and when it's outside, maybe the center is somewhere else. Hmm, this is a bit confusing.

Wait, perhaps the torus is fixed, and the sphere is either inside or outside. No, the problem says when T rests on the inside of S, so T is inside S, and when it rests on the outside, T is outside S.

Wait, but the torus is a surface; resting on the inside would mean that the torus is sitting inside the sphere, touching it along a circle. Similarly, when it's outside, it's touching the sphere along another circle.

So, perhaps the sphere is fixed, and the torus is either inside or outside. But perhaps the sphere is also centered at the origin, and the torus is centered there as well.

So, the sphere is centered at the origin with radius 11, and the torus is also centered at the origin, with major radius 6 and minor radius 3.

So, when the torus is inside the sphere, the sphere's surface is outside the torus, and touches it at points. Similarly, when the torus is outside, the sphere is inside the torus.

Wait, but the torus is a surface, so in reality, when the torus is inside the sphere, the sphere is larger, so the sphere will touch the torus at a certain point. But wait, the torus is a 2D surface in 3D space. So, the sphere and the torus can intersect along a circle, which would be the case when they are tangent along a circle.

So, in the case of internal tangency, the sphere is larger, and the torus is inside. So, the sphere's surface touches the torus along a circle. Similarly, in external tangency, the sphere is inside the torus, and they touch along another circle.

Wait, but the sphere is fixed with radius 11. So, when the torus is inside, the sphere is bigger, and when the torus is outside, the sphere is inside the torus.

But how to find the radii r_i and r_o of the circles along which they are tangent.

Hmm. Maybe I can think of the points where the sphere and the torus are tangent. Since both are surfaces of revolution around the same axis (the z-axis, which I can assume), the circle of tangency will lie in a plane perpendicular to the z-axis.

So, let's consider the cross-sectional view in the x-z plane. The torus in cross-section would look like two circles (each of radius 3) centered at (6,0) and (-6,0), but wait, no. Wait, actually, in cross-section, the torus would look like a circle of radius 3, centered at a distance R (6) from the origin, so when you look at the cross-section along the plane perpendicular to the axis, it's a circle.

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to consider the points of tangency in cylindrical coordinates. Let me model the problem in cylindrical coordinates (ρ, φ, z), where ρ is the radial distance in the x-y plane.

The equation of the sphere is ρ² + z² = 11² = 121.

The equation of the torus is (ρ - 6)² + z² = 3² = 9.

We need to find the points where the sphere and the torus are tangent. Since they are both surfaces of revolution, the points of tangency will lie in a plane perpendicular to the z-axis, i.e., for a fixed z.

Wait, no. Actually, in 3D, the points of tangency for two surfaces of revolution around the same axis should lie along a circle, which is a level set in the torus and the sphere. So, for each point on the circle of tangency, the gradients (normals) of the sphere and the torus should be aligned.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to consider the cross-section in the x-z plane, treating everything as 2D circles, and then the circle of tangency would correspond to points where both curves are tangent in this plane.

Wait, but in 3D, the sphere is a surface, and the torus is another surface, and their intersection is a circle where their normals are the same. So, perhaps if I can find the points where their normals are the same, that will give me the circle of tangency.

Alternatively, maybe I can parameterize the torus and find where it intersects the sphere, then find the condition for tangency.

Alternatively, perhaps I can find the distance from the origin to the torus and set that equal to the sphere's radius, then find the points where the surfaces are tangent.

Wait, let me try this approach.

The distance from the origin to a point on the torus can be found using the equation of the torus. For a point (x, y, z) on the torus, we have:

(√(x² + y²) - 6)² + z² = 9.

Let me denote ρ = √(x² + y²). Then the equation becomes:

(ρ - 6)² + z² = 9.

Expanding that, we get:

ρ² - 12ρ + 36 + z² = 9

ρ² + z² -12ρ + 36 -9 =0

ρ² + z² -12ρ +27=0

But the sphere's equation is ρ² + z² = 121.

So, substituting ρ² + z² from the sphere's equation into the torus's equation:

121 -12ρ +27 =0

So, 148 -12ρ=0

12ρ=148

ρ=148/12=37/3≈12.333...

Wait, that's interesting. So, the value of ρ where the sphere and torus are tangent is 37/3. But wait, that's the radial distance in the x-y plane. So, the circle of tangency lies in a plane where ρ=37/3, and z is determined by the sphere's equation.

Wait, but wait a second. If I substitute ρ² + z²=121 into the torus equation, I get a condition that ρ must be 37/3. So, substituting that back, the z-coordinate is sqrt(121 - (37/3)^2). Let me compute that.

(37/3)^2 = (1369)/9 ≈152.111

121 is 1089/9.

So, 1089/9 - 1369/9 = (1089 -1369)/9 = (-280)/9.

Wait, that's negative, which would mean z is imaginary. That can't be right. Hmm, so perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, let me redo the substitution.

Sphere: ρ² + z² = 121

Torus: (ρ -6)^2 + z² =9

Subtract the torus equation from the sphere equation:

ρ² + z² - [(ρ -6)^2 + z²] =121 -9

Simplify:

ρ² - (ρ² -12ρ +36) =112

ρ² -ρ² +12ρ -36=112

12ρ -36=112

12ρ=148

ρ=148/12=37/3≈12.333...

So, same result. Then z²=121 - (37/3)^2=121 - 1369/9.

Compute 121 as 1089/9.

1089/9 -1369/9= (1089-1369)/9= (-280)/9.

Negative, which is impossible because z² can't be negative.

Hmm, that suggests that there is no real solution, which can't be the case, because the sphere and torus must intersect (be tangent) along a circle.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that when the torus is inside the sphere, the sphere's equation is ρ² + z² =121, and the torus's equation is (ρ -6)^2 + z²=9. So, when we subtract the two equations, we get:

ρ² + z² - [(ρ -6)^2 + z²] =121 -9=112

Which simplifies to 12ρ -36=112 → 12ρ=148 → ρ=37/3≈12.333, which is greater than the sphere's radius (11), which is impossible because ρ can't be larger than the sphere's radius if the torus is inside.

Wait, that suggests that when the torus is inside the sphere, the points where they are tangent must have a ρ less than 11.

But according to the calculation, ρ=37/3≈12.333, which is bigger than 11, which is impossible. So, perhaps my approach is wrong.

Wait, maybe I should model it differently. Let me think: When the torus is inside the sphere, the sphere is larger, so the sphere's center is at the origin, and the torus is inside it. The points of tangency would be where the sphere and torus touch. But according to the previous calculation, the ρ where this occurs is 37/3≈12.333, which is outside the sphere. That can't be.

Hence, perhaps I made a mistake in the setup.

Wait, maybe the sphere isn't centered at the origin. Wait, no, the problem doesn't specify, but I assumed the sphere is centered at the origin. Alternatively, perhaps the torus is centered at the origin, but the sphere is offset.

Wait, perhaps the internal and external cases involve different positions of the sphere relative to the torus.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the distance between the centers of the sphere and the torus. But the torus is a surface, not a solid, so maybe the "center" of the torus isn't clearly defined. Hmm, maybe I should think about the center of the generating circle of the torus.

Wait, the generating circle has radius 3, and the distance from its center to the axis is 6. So, the major radius is 6, minor radius 3.

So, the center of the generating circle is at a distance 6 from the axis. So, in cylindrical coordinates, that's at (ρ=6, φ=0, z=0).

So, the center of the generating circle is at (6,0,0). So, when the torus is inside the sphere, the sphere must be centered such that the point on the torus closest to the sphere's center is at a distance of 11 (the sphere's radius).

Wait, maybe the sphere is centered at a point along the axis of the torus. So, for internal tangency, the sphere is outside the torus, so the center of the sphere is along the axis, at some distance from the torus's center.

Wait, perhaps I should model the torus as a surface where each point on the torus is at a distance of 6 + 3 cos θ from the origin in the radial direction, but that's not exactly correct.

Wait, maybe it's better to think in terms of points on the torus. The torus can be parameterized as:

x = (6 + 3 cos φ) cos θ

y = (6 + 3 cos φ) sin θ

z = 3 sin φ

Where φ and θ are angles parameterizing the torus.

But I'm not sure if that helps. Alternatively, perhaps I can consider the distance from the origin to a point on the torus.

So, the distance squared from the origin is x² + y² + z².

From the torus equation, we have (ρ -6)^2 + z² =9, where ρ² = x² + y².

So, distance squared from origin is ρ² + z².

From the torus equation, (ρ -6)^2 + z²=9 → ρ² -12 ρ +36 + z²=9 → ρ² + z² =12 ρ -27.

So, from the sphere's perspective, we have sphere equation: ρ² + z² =121.

So, set 12 ρ -27=121 → 12 ρ=148 → ρ=148/12=37/3≈12.333.

Wait, that brings us back to the same problem. So, the point on the torus that's farthest from the origin is at ρ=37/3≈12.333, which is larger than the sphere's radius of 11, so the torus would stick out beyond the sphere. But that's when the sphere is centered at the origin.

Wait, perhaps when the torus is inside the sphere, the sphere must be larger, but the sphere is fixed at radius 11. So, perhaps the torus must be centered at a different point relative to the sphere.

Wait, maybe the sphere is centered at the origin, and the torus is placed such that its center (the center of the generating circle) is at some point along the axis. Let me think: when the torus is inside the sphere, the sphere's center is at the origin, and the torus is placed such that the generating circle is centered at (d, 0, 0), where d is the distance from the origin.

Wait, maybe I should model it this way. Let me denote the center of the generating circle as point C, which is at (d, 0, 0). The generating circle has radius 3, so any point on the torus is at a distance of 3 from C, and C is at distance d from the origin.

So, the distance from the origin to any point P on the torus is |OP| = sqrt( (d + 3 cos φ cos θ)^2 + (3 cos φ sin θ)^2 + (3 sin φ)^2 )

Wait, that seems complicated. Maybe I can compute |OP|².

|OP|² = (d + 3 cos φ cos θ)^2 + (3 cos φ sin θ)^2 + (3 sin φ)^2

Expanding:

= d² + 6 d cos φ cos θ + 9 cos² φ cos² θ + 9 cos² φ sin² θ + 9 sin² φ

Simplify the terms:

The terms with cos² φ: 9 cos² φ (cos² θ + sin² θ) =9 cos² φ

So, |OP|²= d² +6 d cos φ cos θ +9 cos² φ +9 sin² φ

Simplify further:

= d² +6 d cos φ cos θ +9 (cos² φ + sin² φ)

= d² +6 d cos φ cos θ +9

Hmm, but this still seems complicated. Maybe I can consider the maximum and minimum distances from the origin to points on the torus.

Wait, but I'm looking for points where the sphere and torus are tangent. So, the distance from the origin to the torus must be 11 at those points.

Wait, maybe I can model the problem such that the torus is inside the sphere, so the sphere is centered at the origin, and the torus is placed such that the center of its generating circle is along the z-axis at a distance of a from the origin.

Wait, perhaps it's better to represent the torus as a surface where each point on the torus is at a distance of R ± r from the origin, where R is the major radius and r is the minor radius. But wait, that's not accurate because the torus is a surface of revolution, not a spherical shell.

Alternatively, maybe I can model the torus as the set of points where the distance from the origin is between R - r and R + r. But that's also not correct because the torus is a surface, not a solid.

Wait, perhaps the maximum and minimum distances from the origin to the torus are R + r and R - r, respectively. So, when the sphere is centered at the origin with radius 11, the torus can be placed such that its maximum distance from the origin is 6 + 3 =9, which is less than 11, so the sphere would enclose the torus. But then, the sphere and torus would intersect in more than a circle, which contradicts the problem statement.

Wait, perhaps I'm making this more complicated. Let me think differently. The torus is a surface, and so is the sphere. When they are tangent along a circle, their centers are aligned along the axis of the torus, which I can take as the z-axis.

So, let me position the sphere such that its center is along the z-axis, but not necessarily at the origin. Let's say the sphere's center is at (0, 0, h). Then, the sphere's equation is x² + y² + (z - h)^2 = 11² =121.

The torus is centered at the origin, with major radius 6, minor radius 3, so its equation is (sqrt(x² + y²) -6)^2 + z²=9.

Now, when the sphere and torus are tangent along a circle, they share a common tangent plane at every point on that circle. So, the gradients (normals) of the sphere and torus at those points must be the same.

The normal vector to the sphere at a point (x, y, z) is (2x, 2y, 2(z - h)), and the normal to the torus is found by taking the gradient of its equation.

The torus equation: (sqrt(x² + y²) -6)^2 + z²=9.

Let me compute the gradient. Let me denote f(x,y,z)=(sqrt(x² + y²) -6)^2 + z² -9.

The partial derivatives:

df/dx = 2(sqrt(x² + y²) -6) * (x / sqrt(x² + y²))

Similarly, df/dy = 2(sqrt(x² + y²) -6) * (y / sqrt(x² + y²))

df/dz = 2z

So, the normal vector to the torus is (df/dx, df/dy, df/dz) = [2x ( (sqrt(x² + y²) -6) / sqrt(x² + y²) ), 2y ( (sqrt(x² + y²) -6) / sqrt(x² + y²) ), 2z ]

And the normal to the sphere is (2x, 2y, 2(z - h)).

For the normals to be colinear, the torus's normal must be a scalar multiple of the sphere's normal.

So, for some scalar λ, we have:

2x ( (sqrt(x² + y²) -6) / sqrt(x² + y²) ) = λ * 2x

2y ( (sqrt(x² + y²) -6) / sqrt(x² + y²) ) = λ * 2y

2z = λ * 2(z - h)

Let me simplify this.

From the first equation, if x ≠ 0, we can divide both sides by 2x:

( (sqrt(x² + y²) -6) / sqrt(x² + y²) ) = λ

Similarly, from the second equation, if y ≠0,

( (sqrt(x² + y²) -6) / sqrt(x² + y²) ) = λ

So, both give the same expression for λ. Now, from the third equation:

2z = λ * 2(z - h)

Divide both sides by 2:

z = λ (z -h)

So, substituting λ from above:

z = [ (sqrt(x² + y²) -6) / sqrt(x² + y²) ] * (z - h)

Let me denote ρ = sqrt(x² + y²). Then,

z = [ (ρ -6)/ρ ] (z - h)

Multiply both sides by ρ:

ρ z = (ρ -6)(z - h)

Expand the right side:

ρ z = (ρ z - ρ h -6 z +6 h )

Bring all terms to the left:

ρ z - (ρ z - ρ h -6 z +6 h ) =0

Simplify:

ρ z -ρ z + ρ h +6 z -6 h =0

So,

ρ h +6 z -6 h =0

Factor:

h (ρ -6) +6 z =0

So,

h (ρ -6) = -6 z

Let me write this as:

h (ρ -6) = -6 z → equation (1)

Now, we also have the equations of the sphere and the torus.

Sphere: x² + y² + (z - h)^2 =121 → ρ² + (z -h)^2=121 → equation (2)

Torus: (ρ -6)^2 + z²=9 → equation (3)

So, now we have three equations: (1), (2), and (3).

Let me try to solve these.

From equation (1):

h (ρ -6) = -6 z → z= [ -h (ρ -6) ] /6 = [ h (6 - ρ) ] /6

So, z= [h (6 - ρ)] /6 → equation (1a)

Now, substitute z into equations (2) and (3).

From equation (2):

ρ² + (z -h)^2=121

Substituting z from (1a):

ρ² + ( [h(6-ρ)/6 ] - h )² =121

Simplify the second term:

[ h(6 - ρ)/6 - h ] = h [ (6 - ρ)/6 - 1 ] = h [ (6 - ρ -6)/6 ] = h [ (-ρ)/6 ] = - h ρ /6

So, equation (2) becomes:

ρ² + ( - h ρ /6 )² =121 → ρ² + (h² ρ²)/36 =121

Factor:

ρ² [1 + h²/36 ] =121 → ρ² =121 / [1 + h²/36 ] =121 *36 / (36 + h²)

Similarly, equation (3):

(ρ -6)^2 + z²=9

Again, substitute z from (1a):

(ρ -6)^2 + [ h (6 - ρ)/6 ]² =9

Let's compute each term:

(ρ -6)^2 = (6 -ρ)^2

[ h (6 -ρ)/6 ]^2 = h² (6 -ρ)^2 /36

So, equation (3) becomes:

(6 -ρ)^2 [1 + h²/36 ]=9

So, (6 -ρ)^2 =9 / [1 + h²/36 ]

Take square roots:

6 -ρ = ±3 / sqrt(1 + h²/36 )

But since we're dealing with a torus inside a sphere, let's think about the geometry. When the torus is inside, the sphere is larger. The point of tangency would lie where ρ is maximum, I think. Or perhaps minimum. Wait, maybe not. Alternatively, perhaps the circle of tangency is at a particular ρ.

But perhaps I can square both sides:

(6 -ρ)^2 =9 / [1 + h²/36 ]

So,

(6 -ρ)^2 =9 / [ (36 + h²)/36 ] =9 *36 / (36 + h² )=324/(36 +h² )

Thus,

(6 -ρ)^2 = 324/(36 +h² )

But from equation (2), we have ρ²= 121 *36 / (36 +h² )

So, let me denote D =36 +h²

So, equation (2) becomes ρ²= (121 *36 )/ D

Equation (3) becomes (6 -ρ)^2 =324/D

So, we have:

(6 -ρ)^2 =324/D

From equation (2), D=36 +h²= (121 *36 ) / ρ² → h²= (121 *36 ) / ρ² -36.

But perhaps we can relate (6 -ρ)^2 and ρ².

Compute (6 -ρ)^2 = 36 -12ρ +ρ²

So, 36 -12ρ +ρ²=324/D

But D=36 +h², and from equation (2), D= (121 *36 ) / ρ²

So,

36 -12ρ +ρ²=324/( (121 *36 ) / ρ² )=324 * ρ²/(121 *36 )

Simplify:

36 -12ρ +ρ²= (324 / (121 *36 )) * ρ²

Compute 324/(121*36 )= (324/36)/121=9/121

So,

36 -12ρ +ρ²= (9/121) ρ²

Multiply both sides by 121 to eliminate denominators:

121*(36) -121*12ρ +121 ρ² =9 ρ²

Simplify:

4356 -1452ρ +121ρ² =9ρ²

Bring all terms to left:

4356 -1452ρ +121ρ² -9ρ²=0 → 4356 -1452ρ +112ρ²=0

Let me write it as:

112ρ² -1452ρ +4356=0

Let me simplify the coefficients by dividing by 4:

28ρ² -363ρ +1089=0

Check if this quadratic can be solved.

Use quadratic formula:

ρ = [363 ± sqrt(363² -4*28*1089)]/(2*28)

Compute discriminant:

363² = (360 +3)^2=360² +2*360*3 +3²=129600 +2160 +9=131769

4*28*1089=4*28*1089=112*1089= Let me compute 1000*112=112000, 89*112= (90-1)*112=10080 -112=9968 → total 112000+9968=121,968.

So, discriminant=131769 -121968=9801.

sqrt(9801)=99.

So,

ρ= [363 ±99]/(56)

Compute both possibilities:

1. (363 +99)/56=462/56=462 ÷14=33; 56 ÷14=4 → 33/4=8.25

2. (363 -99)/56=264/56=264 ÷8=33; 56 ÷8=7 →33/7≈4.714

So, ρ=33/4=8.25 or ρ=33/7≈4.714.

Now, let's consider each case.

Case 1: ρ=33/4=8.25

Compute h from equation (1):

h (ρ -6)= -6 z

But from equation (1a):

z= [h (6 -ρ)] /6 = [h (6 -33/4)]/6= [h (-15/4)]/6= (-15 h)/(24)= (-5 h)/8

So, z= (-5h)/8.

From equation (1):

h (ρ -6)= -6 z → h*(33/4 -6)= -6*(-5h/8 )

Simplify:

h*(33/4 -24/4)= h*(9/4)= 6*(5h/8 )=30h/8=15h/4

So,

(9/4)h = (15/4)h → 9h/4=15h/4 → 9h=15h → 6h=0 → h=0.

So, h=0. So, the sphere is centered at the origin.

Wait, but earlier when I tried this, I found that ρ=37/3≈12.333, which didn't make sense because it was greater than the sphere's radius. But in this case, with h=0, let's see:

From equation (2):

ρ²= (121*36)/D, where D=36 +h²=36.

So, ρ²= (121*36)/36=121 → ρ=11.

But from case 1, ρ=8.25. So, this is a contradiction. So, perhaps case 1 is not valid.

Case 2: ρ=33/7≈4.714.

Compute h from equation (1):

h (33/7 -6)= -6 z.

Compute 33/7 -6=33/7 -42/7= -9/7.

So,

h*(-9/7)= -6 z → z= [ (9/7) h ] /6= (3 h)/14.

From equation (1a):

z= [h (6 -ρ)] /6= h*(6 -33/7)/6= h*(42/7 -33/7)/6= h*(9/7)/6= (9 h)/(42)= (3 h)/14.

Which matches the previous result. So, no contradiction.

Now, compute D=36 +h².

From equation (2):

ρ²= (121*36)/D → (33/7)^2= (121*36)/D → (1089/49)= (4356)/D → D=4356*(49/1089)= (4356/1089)*49.

Compute 4356 ÷1089: 1089*4=4356 → so 4356/1089=4.

So, D=4*49=196.

Thus, D=36 +h²=196 → h²=160 → h=±sqrt(160)=±4*sqrt(10).

So, h=±4√10.

Now, since we're considering the internal tangent, the sphere is outside the torus, so the center should be along the positive z-axis. So, h=4√10.

Wait, but let me check whether this makes sense.

So, with h=4√10, the sphere is centered at (0,0,4√10), and the torus is centered at the origin. The points of tangency are at ρ=33/7≈4.714, and z= (3 h)/14= (3*4√10)/14= (12√10)/14= (6√10)/7.

So, the circle of tangency lies in the plane z=6√10/7.

The radius of this circle is the radius of the sphere at that height. The sphere's equation is x² + y² + (z -4√10)^2=121.

At z=6√10/7, the radius r_i is sqrt(121 - (6√10/7 -4√10)^2 )

Compute (6√10/7 -4√10)= (6√10 -28√10)/7= (-22√10)/7.

So, ( -22√10 /7 )^2= (484*10)/49=4840/49.

So, r_i= sqrt(121 -4840/49 )

Convert 121 to 121*49/49=5929/49.

So, r_i= sqrt( (5929 -4840)/49 )= sqrt(1089/49 )=33/7≈4.714.

Wait, that's the same as ρ. So, the radius of the circle of tangency r_i is 33/7.

Wait, but earlier, when we had the sphere centered at the origin, the ρ was 37/3≈12.333, which was beyond the sphere's radius of 11, which suggested an inconsistency. But in this case, when the sphere is centered at (0,0,4√10), the circle of tangency has radius r_i=33/7.

Similarly, for the external tangent, when the torus is outside the sphere, we can perform a similar analysis.

Wait, but in the problem statement, when T rests on the inside of S, it's internally tangent along a circle with radius r_i, and when it rests on the outside, it's externally tangent along a circle with radius r_o. So, I think I just found r_i=33/7.

Now, I need to find r_o, the radius of the circle when the torus is externally tangent to the sphere.

In this case, the sphere is inside the torus. So, the sphere must be smaller, but the sphere's radius is fixed at 11. Wait, no, the torus can be placed such that the sphere is inside the torus, and they are tangent along another circle.

Wait, perhaps the external case is when the sphere is inside the torus, and the point of tangency is on the outer side of the torus.

Wait, let me model this similarly. The sphere is centered at (0,0,h), and the torus is centered at the origin. Now, when the sphere is inside the torus, the sphere's surface is tangent to the torus's outer surface.

So, similar to before, the normals must be colinear, leading to similar equations. So, let me go through the process again, but perhaps with a different h.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use symmetry. When the sphere is inside the torus, the center of the sphere will be along the negative z-axis.

Wait, but perhaps the process is similar. So, let me proceed.

Again, the sphere's equation is x² + y² + (z - h)^2=121.

The torus's equation is (sqrt(x² + y²) -6)^2 + z²=9.

The normals must be colinear, leading to the same equations as before, but perhaps with h negative.

Wait, but let me follow the same steps.

The normal vectors must be colinear, so from the previous analysis, we had:

h (ρ -6) = -6 z.

And from the equations of the sphere and torus, we arrived at:

28ρ² -363ρ +1089=0, which had solutions ρ=33/4 and 33/7.

Wait, but in the case where the sphere is inside the torus, perhaps we take h negative. Let me try h=-4√10.

Compute h=-4√10.

Then, from equation (1a):

z= [h (6 -ρ)]/6= [(-4√10)(6 -ρ)]/6= [ (-4√10)(6 -ρ) ]/6= [ (-4√10)(6 -ρ) ]/6= [ (-2√10)(6 -ρ) ]/3= [ 2√10 (ρ -6) ]/3.

Wait, but let's compute from equation (1):

h (ρ -6)= -6 z → (-4√10)(ρ -6)= -6 z → z= [4√10 (ρ -6)]/6= [2√10 (ρ -6)]/3.

Which is the same as before.

Now, from equation (2):

ρ²= (121*36)/D, where D=36 +h²=36 + (16*10)=36+160=196.

So, ρ²= (121*36)/196= (4356)/196= 22.2857...

Wait, but 4356 ÷196: 196*22=4312, 4356-4312=44 → 22 +44/196=22+11/49≈22.224.

So, ρ= sqrt(22.224)= approximately 4.714, which is 33/7, same as before.

Wait, but that's the same ρ as in the internal case. That can't be right, can it?

Wait, perhaps I'm making a mistake here. Let me double-check.

Wait, when the sphere is inside the torus, the points of tangency would be on the outer part of the torus, so perhaps the ρ would be larger. But according to the solution, it's the same ρ as the internal case. That seems contradictory.

Wait, perhaps my earlier assumption that the sphere's center is at (0,0,4√10) is incorrect. Maybe for external tangency, the sphere's center is at a different position.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that for external tangency, the sphere is inside the torus, so the center of the sphere is closer to the torus's center.

Wait, but then the distance from the origin to the sphere's center would be different.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider a different approach. Let me think about the maximum and minimum distances from the origin to the torus.

Wait, for a point on the torus, the distance from the origin can be found from the equation (sqrt(x^2 + y^2) -6)^2 + z^2=9.

The maximum distance occurs when sqrt(x^2 + y^2) is maximum, which would be when sqrt(x^2 + y^2)=6 +3=9, so the maximum distance is sqrt(9^2 +3^2)=sqrt(81+9)=sqrt(90)=3√10≈9.4868.

The minimum distance occurs when sqrt(x^2 + y^2)=6 -3=3, so the minimum distance is sqrt(3^2 +3^2)=sqrt(18)=3√2≈4.2426.

So, the torus is a surface where points range from 3√2≈4.2426 to 3√10≈9.4868 from the origin.

The sphere has a radius of 11, so when the sphere is centered at the origin, the torus lies entirely inside the sphere because 3√10≈9.4868 <11.

Wait, but that contradicts the problem statement, which suggests that when the torus is inside the sphere, it's tangent along a circle. If the torus is entirely inside, they would intersect in more than a single circle.

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake earlier in my model.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that the torus is in 3D, and when it's inside the sphere, the sphere is larger, but the torus is placed such that the sphere is not centered at the origin. So, the sphere is centered elsewhere, and the torus is centered at the origin.

Wait, but that complicates things. Alternatively, perhaps the sphere is fixed, and the torus is moved inside or outside relative to it.

Wait, the problem says "When T rests on the inside of S, it is internally tangent to S along a circle with radius r_i, and when T rests on the outside of S, it is externally tangent to S along a circle with radius r_o."

So, perhaps the sphere is fixed, and the torus is positioned such that it is either inside or outside, touching along a circle.

Wait, but the sphere is fixed with radius 11, so when the torus is inside, it's entirely inside except for the tangent circle, and when it's outside, it's entirely outside except for the tangent circle.

Wait, but how can the torus, which has a maximum distance from its center of 9.4868, fit inside a sphere of radius 11? Because 9.4868 <11, so the torus can be placed inside the sphere, touching it along a circle. Similarly, when the torus is outside, the sphere must be placed inside the torus, but the sphere's radius is 11, which is larger than the torus's maximum distance from its center (9.4868), which would mean the sphere can't fit inside the torus. Hmm, that doesn't make sense.

Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Maybe the torus is not centered at the origin when it's inside or outside the sphere. Alternatively, perhaps the sphere is fixed at the origin, and the torus is positioned such that its center is at a certain point, leading to internal or external tangency.

Wait, perhaps I should model the problem by considering the sphere as fixed at the origin, and the torus is placed such that it is either inside or outside, touching the sphere along a circle.

But for external tangency, the torus must encompass the sphere, but the torus's maximum radius is only 9.4868, while the sphere's radius is 11. So, that would mean the sphere is larger than the torus, making external tangency impossible. Hmm, this is confusing.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the maximum and minimum distances from the origin to the torus.

Wait, the equation of the torus is (sqrt(x² + y²) -6)^2 + z²=9.

Expressed as (ρ -6)^2 + z²=9, where ρ=sqrt(x² + y²).

So, to find the maximum and minimum distances from the origin, we can find the maximum and minimum of sqrt(ρ² + z²).

But from the torus equation, (ρ -6)^2 + z²=9.

Let me consider rho and z as variables.

Let me denote D = sqrt(ρ² + z²). We need to find the maximum and minimum of D subject to (ρ -6)^2 + z²=9.

Let me set up the Lagrangian:

L=ρ² + z² + λ[(ρ -6)^2 + z² -9]

Take partial derivatives:

dL/dρ=2ρ + λ*2(ρ-6)=0 → 2ρ + 2λ(ρ -6)=0 → ρ(1 + λ)=6λ

dL/dz=2z + λ*2z=0 → 2z(1 + λ)=0

dL/dλ=(ρ -6)^2 + z² -9=0

From the z derivative: 2z(1 + λ)=0 → Either z=0 or λ=-1.

Case 1: z=0.

Then, from the torus equation: (ρ -6)^2=9 → ρ-6=±3 → ρ=9 or ρ=3.

Thus, D= sqrt(ρ² +0)=|ρ|=9 or 3.

So, maximum D=9, minimum D=3.

Case 2: λ=-1.

From dL/dρ equation: ρ(1 -1)=6*(-1) → 0= -6 → Contradiction. So, no solution.

Thus, maximum distance is 9, minimum is 3.

So, the torus lies between 3 and 9 units from the origin.

So, the sphere of radius 11 is larger than the torus's maximum distance of 9. So, the torus can be placed inside the sphere, touching it along a circle where D=11.

Wait, but wait, the maximum distance from the origin to the torus is 9, which is less than 11. So, the entire torus lies inside the sphere, so the sphere and torus would intersect along a circle where the distance from the origin is 9.

Wait, but that's the maximum distance. So, perhaps the sphere and torus are tangent along that circle.

Wait, but if the sphere is centered at the origin, then the points on the torus at maximum distance (9) would lie on the sphere's surface only if 9=11, which is not the case. So, that suggests that the sphere and torus don't touch unless the sphere is moved.

Hmm, this is getting confusing. Let me try to think differently. Maybe I should model the problem such that the sphere is fixed, and the torus is placed such that it is tangent to the sphere either internally or externally.

Wait, perhaps when the torus is inside the sphere, the sphere's center is at a certain position relative to the torus, and when it's outside, it's at another position.

Alternatively, perhaps I should think of the sphere as fixed, and the torus being placed such that it is externally or internally tangent.

Wait, let me think about the internal tangent case. The sphere is fixed with radius 11, centered at the origin. The torus is placed such that it's inside the sphere and tangent along a circle.

In this case, the center of the torus's generating circle is at some point, say, along the z-axis at (0,0,a), and the sphere is at (0,0,0). The points of tangency would lie along a circle where the sphere and torus touch.

But earlier calculations suggest that the points of tangency are at ρ=33/7≈4.714, which is within the sphere's radius of 11.

Similarly, for external tangency, the sphere is inside the torus, so the torus's generating circle's center is placed such that the sphere touches the torus's outer surface.

But given that the torus's maximum distance from its center is 9.4868, and the sphere's radius is 11, perhaps the sphere can't fit inside the torus. So, maybe external tangency isn't possible, which contradicts the problem statement.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the maximum distance.

Wait, earlier I considered that the maximum distance from the origin to the torus is 9, but that's when the torus is centered at the origin. If the torus is placed such that its generating circle's center is at a different point, perhaps the maximum distance increases.

Wait, no. The torus is defined with major radius 6 and minor radius 3. So, its maximum distance from its own center is 6 +3=9. So, if it's centered at the origin, the maximum distance from the origin is 9. But if it's placed elsewhere, the distances would change.

Wait, but in the problem, the torus is fixed with major radius 6 and minor radius 3. So, perhaps when it's placed inside the sphere, it's centered at the origin, and when it's placed outside, it's shifted so that the sphere is inside the torus.

Wait, but the sphere has a radius of 11, which is larger than the torus's maximum distance of 9 from its own center. So, the sphere can't fit inside the torus.

Hmm, this is getting me stuck. Let me try to think differently.

Wait, perhaps the problem is not about the sphere and torus being centered at the same point. Instead, when the torus is inside the sphere, the sphere's center is not at the origin of the torus. So, perhaps the sphere's center is at a point along the axis of the torus, and the torus is placed such that it's inside the sphere and tangent along a circle. Similarly, when it's outside, the sphere is placed inside the torus.

Wait, let's model this case. Let me denote the sphere's center as point C, and the torus's generating circle's center as point O. The distance between C and O is d.

When the torus is inside the sphere, the sphere's radius is 11, and the torus is placed such that the distance from C to O is such that the sphere and torus are tangent.

Similarly, when the torus is outside, the sphere is placed inside the torus, and their centers are separated by a distance d.

Wait, perhaps using the method of offset between centers, similar to two circles in 2D, but in 3D.

In 2D, when two circles are externally tangent, the distance between centers is equal to the sum of their radii. When internally tangent, it's equal to the difference.

Similarly, in 3D, for spheres, the distance between centers is the sum (external) or difference (internal) of their radii.

But the torus is not a sphere, so perhaps this approach doesn't apply directly.

Wait, but perhaps I can model the torus as a surface where each point on the torus is at a distance of R ± r from the generating circle's center. So, in 3D, the torus can be thought of as a surface where each point is at a distance of 6 + 3 cos θ from the generating circle's center, which is at a distance of 6 from the torus's main center.

Wait, perhaps this is getting too abstract. Maybe I should find the radii of the circles of tangency by considering the points where the sphere and torus touch.

Wait, from the earlier calculation, when the sphere is placed such that the torus is inside and tangent, the radius of the circle of tangency is r_i=33/7.

Similarly, when the torus is outside and tangent, perhaps the radius is r_o= something else.

Wait, but I'm not sure how to find r_o. Let me think.

Wait, perhaps when the torus is outside the sphere, the sphere is inside the torus, and the points of tangency are on the outer part of the torus. So, the distance from the origin to the sphere's center would be such that the sphere touches the torus's outer surface.

Wait, but earlier, I found that when the sphere is centered at (0,0,4√10), the points of tangency are at ρ=33/7, which is about 4.714. But if I instead place the sphere's center at (0,0,-4√10), perhaps the points of tangency would be at a larger ρ, leading to a different r_o.

Wait, let's try that. Let me assume h=-4√10.

Then, from equation (1a):

z= [h (6 -ρ)] /6= [ (-4√10)(6 -ρ) ]/6= [ (-4√10)(6 -ρ) ]/6= [ (-2√10)(6 -ρ) ]/3= [ 2√10 (ρ -6) ] /3.

Now, from equation (2):

ρ²= (121*36)/D, where D=36 +h²=36 + (16*10)=36+160=196.

So, ρ²= (121*36)/196= (4356)/196=22.2857.

So, ρ= sqrt(22.2857)= approximately 4.714, which is 33/7.

Wait, same as before. So, this suggests that regardless of the position of the sphere's center along the z-axis, the points of tangency have the same ρ, which is 33/7.

Hmm, that's strange. Perhaps the radius of the circle of tangency is the same in both internal and external cases, which would mean r_i - r_o=0, but the problem says they're different. So, I must have made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps I'm confusing the radius of the circle of tangency with the radius in the direction perpendicular to the z-axis.

Wait, when the sphere is inside the torus, the circle of tangency would have a different radius. But according to my calculations, it's the same. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm missing something in the equations. Let me check.

Wait, when I solved the quadratic equation, I got two solutions for ρ: 33/4 and 33/7. When h=4√10, I got ρ=33/7, which gave a valid solution. When h=-4√10, I still get ρ=33/7, which is the same as the internal case.

But this suggests that the radius of the circle of tangency is the same for both internal and external cases, which contradicts the problem statement.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the setup. Let me go back.

The problem states that the torus is the surface formed by revolving a circle of radius 3 around an axis in its plane, at a distance 6 from the center. So, the major radius R=6, minor radius r=3.

The sphere has radius 11. When the torus is inside the sphere, they are tangent along a circle with radius r_i. When the torus is outside, they're tangent along a circle with radius r_o.

Wait, perhaps the difference is that in the internal case, the sphere is larger, and the circle of tangency is on the outer part of the torus, while in the external case, the sphere is smaller, and the circle is on the inner part.

But in our earlier calculation, we found that the circle of tangency is at ρ=33/7, which is approximately 4.714, which is less than the maximum distance of 9 from the origin to the torus. So, perhaps when the sphere is inside the torus, the points of tangency are at a larger ρ, but my calculation only gave ρ=33/7.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that when the sphere is inside the torus, the points of tangency are at a different ρ.

Wait, let me think about another approach. Let me consider a cross-sectional view in the x-z plane.

The sphere has a radius of 11, centered at (0,0,h). The torus is centered at the origin, with major radius 6 and minor radius 3.

In cross-section, the torus would appear as two circles: one at (6,0) with radius 3, and another at (-6,0) with radius 3.

The sphere in cross-section is a circle with radius 11, centered at (0,h).

The points of tangency would be where the sphere and the torus's cross-sectional circles are tangent.

So, for external tangency, the sphere would be outside the torus's cross-sectional circles, so the distance between centers would be equal to the sum of radii. For internal tangency, it's the difference.

Wait, perhaps this approach can help.

So, in cross-section, the torus is represented by two circles: one at (6,0) with radius 3, and another at (-6,0) with radius 3.

The sphere in cross-section is a circle of radius 11 centered at (0,h).

For internal tangency, the sphere is outside the torus, so the distance between the sphere's center and the torus's cross-sectional circle's center must be equal to 11 -3=8.

Similarly, for external tangency, the distance between centers must be 11 +3=14.

Wait, but in the cross-sectional view, the torus appears as two circles, each at (6,0) and (-6,0). So, perhaps the sphere is tangent to one of these circles.

Wait, but the problem states that the tangency is along a circle, which in cross-section would appear as a single point. Hmm, perhaps not.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Let me model the cross-sectional circle of the torus as a circle at (6,0) with radius 3.

The sphere in cross-section is a circle of radius 11 centered at (0,h).

The condition for tangency is that the distance between centers is equal to the sum or difference of radii.

So, for external tangency, the distance between centers is 11 +3=14.

The center of the torus's cross-sectional circle is at (6,0), and the sphere's center is at (0,h).

So, the distance between centers is sqrt(6^2 + h^2)=sqrt(36 +h²).

Set this equal to 14:

sqrt(36 +h²)=14 → 36 +h²=196 → h²=160 → h=±4√10.

Similarly, for internal tangency, the distance between centers is 11 -3=8.

So,

sqrt(36 +h²)=8 →36 +h²=64 →h²=28 →h=±2√7.

So, in cross-section, the sphere is tangent to the torus's cross-sectional circle at a single point when the centers are separated by 14 or 8.

But in 3D, this would correspond to a circle of tangency. So, the radius of the circle of tangency in 3D would be the same as the radius of the cross-sectional circle, which is 3. Wait, but that can't be right because the problem states different radii for internal and external tangency.

Wait, perhaps not. Let me think. The cross-sectional view shows the sphere tangent to the torus at a single point, but in 3D, this would correspond to a circle. So, the radius of this circle would be determined by the geometry.

Wait, in cross-section, the point of tangency is at (x, z). The 3D circle of tangency would lie in a plane perpendicular to the z-axis, so the radius in that plane would be x.

Wait, in cross-section, for external tangency, the point of tangency is at (x, z), so in 3D, the circle would have radius x.

Similarly, for internal tangency, the point of tangency is at (x, z), so the circle's radius is x.

So, let me compute x for both cases.

For external tangency, the sphere's center is at (0, h)= (0,4√10), and the torus's cross-sectional circle is at (6,0).

The point of tangency lies along the line connecting (6,0) and (0,4√10). The point can be found using similar triangles.

The distance between centers is 14, and the radius of the torus's cross-sectional circle is 3, so the point of tangency is 3 units from (6,0) towards (0,4√10).

Wait, using vectors, the direction vector from (6,0) to (0,4√10) is (-6,4√10).

The unit vector in this direction is (-6,4√10)/14= (-3/7, 2√10/7).

So, the point of tangency is (6,0) +3*(-3/7, 2√10/7)= (6 -9/7, 0 +6√10/7)= (33/7, 6√10/7).

So, in cross-section, the point is (33/7, 6√10/7). So, in 3D, this would correspond to a circle in the plane z=6√10/7, with radius x=33/7.

Similarly, for internal tangency, the distance between centers is 8, and the point of tangency is 3 units from (6,0) towards (0,2√7).

Wait, let me compute for internal tangency.

For internal tangency, the sphere's center is at (0,2√7), because sqrt(36 +h²)=8 → h²=64-36=28 → h=2√7.

The direction vector from (6,0) to (0,2√7) is (-6,2√7).

Unit vector is (-6,2√7)/8= (-3/4, √7/4).

The point of tangency is (6,0) +3*(-3/4, √7/4)= (6 -9/4, 0 +3√7/4)= (15/4, 3√7/4).

Thus, in cross-section, the point is (15/4, 3√7/4). So, in 3D, the circle of tangency lies in the plane z=3√7/4, with radius x=15/4.

Therefore, r_i=33/7 and r_o=15/4.

Wait, but in the cross-sectional analysis, the torus is represented by two circles, each of radius 3, centered at (6,0) and (-6,0). The sphere is tangent to one of these circles in cross-section, so in 3D, the circle of tangency would be in the plane where the cross-section occurs, which is the x-z plane. But I'm not sure if the radius of the circle of tangency is the same as the x-coordinate in the cross-section.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the actual radius in 3D.

In the cross-section, the point of tangency is at (x, z), so in 3D, the circle lies in the plane z=constant, and the radius of the circle would be x. Because in that plane, the sphere and torus are both circles, and their intersection is a single point, which in 3D becomes a circle with radius x.

So, for external tangency, the cross-sectional point is at (33/7, 6√10/7), so the radius of the circle is 33/7.

For internal tangency, the cross-sectional point is at (15/4, 3√7/4), so the radius of the circle is 15/4.

Thus, r_i=33/7 and r_o=15/4.

Therefore, the difference r_i - r_o=33/7 -15/4= (132 -105)/28=27/28.

So, m=27, n=28, which are coprime. Thus, m+n=55.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To solve the problem, we analyze the torus \( T \) and sphere \( S \) in 3D space. The torus has a major radius \( R = 6 \) and minor radius \( r = 3 \). The sphere has a radius of \( 11 \).

### Internal Tangency (\( r_i \))
When the torus is inside the sphere, the sphere is centered at \( (0, 0, 4\sqrt{10}) \). The points of tangency lie in the plane \( z = \frac{6\sqrt{10}}{7} \). Using the cross-sectional analysis, the radius of the circle of tangency is found to be \( \frac{33}{7} \).

### External Tangency (\( r_o \))
When the torus is outside the sphere, the sphere is centered at \( (0, 0, 2\sqrt{7}) \). The points of tangency lie in the plane \( z = \frac{3\sqrt{7}}{4} \). The radius of the circle of tangency is found to be \( \frac{15}{4} \).

### Difference Calculation
The difference between the radii is:
\[
r_i - r_o = \frac{33}{7} - \frac{15}{4} = \frac{132 - 105}{28} = \frac{27}{28}
\]
Thus, \( m = 27 \) and \( n = 28 \), leading to \( m + n = 55 \).

\boxed{55}
