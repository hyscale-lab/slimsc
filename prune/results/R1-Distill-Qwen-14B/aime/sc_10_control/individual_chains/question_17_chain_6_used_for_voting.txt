Okay, so I have this math problem to solve. Let me read it again and try to understand what it's asking.

The problem says: Let B be the set of rectangular boxes with surface area 54 and volume 23. Let r be the radius of the smallest sphere that can contain each of these rectangular boxes. We need to find r squared, which can be written as a fraction p/q where p and q are coprime positive integers. Then, we have to find p + q.

Alright, so I need to find the minimal sphere that can contain any rectangular box from set B. The boxes have a fixed surface area (54) and fixed volume (23). So, all these boxes have the same surface area and volume, but their dimensions can vary as long as they satisfy these two conditions. The sphere must be able to contain any such box, so I need to find the maximum possible space required, which would correspond to the box with the largest possible space diagonal. Because the sphere must enclose the box, the diameter of the sphere must be at least the space diagonal of the box. Hence, the radius would be half of that.

So, the key is to find the box in set B with the maximum space diagonal. Then, the radius r would be half of that diagonal, and r squared would be (diagonal squared)/4. But wait, actually, since r is the radius, the diameter is 2r, so the space diagonal of the box would be equal to 2r. Therefore, r = (space diagonal)/2, so r^2 = (diagonal^2)/4.

Therefore, our task reduces to finding the maximum value of the space diagonal of a box with surface area 54 and volume 23. Once we find that maximum diagonal, we can compute r^2.

Let me denote the dimensions of the rectangular box as x, y, z. So, the surface area S is given by 2(xy + yz + xz) = 54. The volume V is given by xyz = 23.

We need to find the space diagonal, which is sqrt(x^2 + y^2 + z^2). We need to maximize this value given the constraints on S and V.

So, the problem is an optimization problem: maximize sqrt(x^2 + y^2 + z^2) subject to 2(xy + yz + xz) = 54 and xyz = 23.

Since the square root is a monotonically increasing function, maximizing sqrt(x^2 + y^2 + z^2) is equivalent to maximizing x^2 + y^2 + z^2.

So, let's restate the problem: maximize x^2 + y^2 + z^2 subject to 2(xy + yz + xz) = 54 and xyz = 23.

Hmm, this seems like a problem that can be approached using Lagrange multipliers or perhaps some inequalities. Since it's symmetric in x, y, z, maybe the maximum occurs when two variables are equal, or maybe all three are equal? Wait, but if all three are equal, that would be a cube, but let's check if a cube satisfies the given surface area and volume.

If x = y = z, then surface area is 6x^2 = 54, so x^2 = 9, so x = 3. Then, volume would be 3^3 = 27. But our volume is 23, which is less than 27. So, a cube is not the case here, but maybe the box is close to a cube.

Alternatively, maybe the box is such that two sides are equal, say x = y, and z is different. That might simplify things.

Let me try assuming x = y. Then, the surface area becomes 2(x^2 + 2xz) = 54, which simplifies to x^2 + 2xz = 27.

The volume becomes x^2 z = 23.

So, from the volume equation, z = 23 / (x^2).

Substituting into the surface area equation:

x^2 + 2x*(23 / x^2) = 27

Simplify:

x^2 + (46 / x) = 27

Multiply both sides by x to eliminate the denominator:

x^3 + 46 = 27x

Bring all terms to one side:

x^3 - 27x + 46 = 0

Hmm, solving this cubic equation. Let me see if I can find rational roots. By Rational Root Theorem, possible roots are factors of 46 over factors of 1, so ±1, ±2, ±23, ±46.

Let's test x=1: 1 -27 +46 = 20 ≠0

x=2: 8 -54 +46= 0. Oh, x=2 is a root.

So, we can factor out (x-2). Using polynomial division or synthetic division:

Divide x^3 -27x +46 by (x-2):

Using synthetic division:

2 | 1  0  -27  46

          2   4  -46

      1  2  -23   0

So, the cubic factors as (x - 2)(x^2 + 2x -23).

Set equal to zero:

(x - 2)(x^2 + 2x -23) = 0

So, x = 2, or x^2 + 2x -23=0.

Solving x^2 + 2x -23=0, using quadratic formula:

x = [-2 ± sqrt(4 + 92)] / 2 = [-2 ± sqrt(96)] / 2 = [-2 ± 4*sqrt(6)] / 2 = -1 ± 2*sqrt(6).

So, possible roots: x = 2, x = -1 + 2√6 ≈ -1 + 4.898 ≈ 3.898, and x = -1 -2√6, which is negative. Since x is a length, it can't be negative, so x=2 and x≈3.898.

So, we have two possible x's when x=y: x=2 and x≈3.898.

Let me find the corresponding z for each case.

Case 1: x=2. Then, z = 23/(x^2) = 23/4 = 5.75.

So, the box dimensions are 2, 2, 5.75.

Then, the space diagonal is sqrt(2^2 + 2^2 + (5.75)^2) = sqrt(4 + 4 + 33.0625) = sqrt(41.0625) ≈ 6.408.

Case 2: x= -1 + 2√6 ≈ 3.898. Let me compute z:

z = 23/(x^2) = 23 / (( -1 + 2√6 )^2 )

Compute denominator: (-1 + 2√6)^2 = 1 - 4√6 + (2√6)^2 = 1 -4√6 + 24 = 25 -4√6.

So, z = 23 / (25 -4√6)

To rationalize the denominator:

Multiply numerator and denominator by (25 +4√6):

z = 23*(25 +4√6) / [ (25)^2 - (4√6)^2 ) ] = 23*(25 +4√6) / (625 - 16*6) = 23*(25 +4√6)/(625 -96) = 23*(25 +4√6)/529.

Simplify 23/529 = 1/23.

So, z = (25 +4√6)/23 ≈ (25 +4*2.449)/23 ≈ (25 +9.796)/23 ≈ 34.796/23 ≈ 1.513.

So, the box dimensions here are approximately 3.898, 3.898, 1.513.

Compute the space diagonal: sqrt( (3.898)^2 + (3.898)^2 + (1.513)^2 )

Calculate each term:

3.898^2 ≈ 15.193

1.513^2 ≈ 2.289

So, sum: 15.193 +15.193 +2.289 ≈ 32.675

Square root of that is approximately 5.716.

So, the space diagonal here is about 5.716, which is less than the other case.

Wait, so in case 1, when x=2, the space diagonal is about 6.408, which is larger than the other case.

Hmm, that suggests that x=2, y=2, z=5.75 gives a larger space diagonal. But wait, is that the maximum?

Wait, but perhaps the maximum occurs when all three variables are different. So, maybe assuming x=y isn't sufficient. Maybe the maximum occurs when the variables are not equal.

But this complicates things, as we'd have to deal with more variables. Alternatively, perhaps we can use Lagrange multipliers to find the maximum.

So, let's set up the problem with Lagrange multipliers.

We need to maximize f(x,y,z) = x² + y² + z²,

subject to g(x,y,z) = 2(xy + yz + xz) = 54,

and h(x,y,z) = xyz = 23.

So, we can set up the Lagrangian:

L = x² + y² + z² - λ(2(xy + yz + xz) -54) - μ(xyz -23)

Then, taking partial derivatives:

∂L/∂x = 2x - λ(2y + 2z) - μ(yz) = 0

Similarly,

∂L/∂y = 2y - λ(2x + 2z) - μ(xz) = 0

∂L/∂z = 2z - λ(2x + 2y) - μ(xy) = 0

And the constraints:

2(xy + yz + xz) = 54

xyz =23

So, we have a system of five equations with five variables: x, y, z, λ, μ.

This seems quite involved, but perhaps we can find symmetry or some relations.

Let me consider the case where two variables are equal, say x = y. Then, we can see if this assumption satisfies the Lagrangian conditions.

If x = y, then from the first two equations:

2x - λ(2x + 2z) - μ(xz) = 0

2x - λ(2x + 2z) - μ(xz) = 0

These two equations are the same, which is consistent.

But the third equation is:

2z - λ(4x) - μ(x²) = 0

So, we have:

Equation 1: 2x - λ(2x + 2z) - μ(xz) = 0

Equation 3: 2z - 4x λ - x² μ = 0

Let me try to express λ and μ in terms of x and z.

From Equation 1:

2x = λ(2x + 2z) + μ(xz)

Let me solve for μ:

μ(xz) = 2x - λ(2x + 2z)

μ = [2x - 2λ(x + z)] / (xz)

Similarly, from Equation 3:

2z = 4x λ + x² μ

Substitute μ from above:

2z = 4x λ + x² * [2x - 2λ(x + z)] / (xz)

Simplify the second term:

x² * [2x - 2λ(x + z)] / (xz) = x * [2x - 2λ(x + z)] / z = [2x² - 2λ x(x + z)] / z

So, Equation 3 becomes:

2z = 4x λ + [2x² - 2λ x(x + z)] / z

Multiply both sides by z to eliminate denominator:

2z² = 4x λ z + 2x² - 2λ x(x + z)

Let me expand the last term:

-2λ x(x + z) = -2λ x² - 2λ x z

So, putting it all together:

2z² = 4x λ z + 2x² - 2λ x² - 2λ x z

Bring all terms to the left:

2z² -4x λ z -2x² + 2λ x² + 2λ x z =0

Factor terms:

2z² -2x² + (-4x λ z +2λ x z) +2λ x²=0

Simplify coefficients:

-4x λ z +2λ x z = (-2x λ z)

So:

2z² -2x² -2x λ z + 2λ x²=0

Factor out 2:

2[ z² -x² -x λ z + λ x² ] =0

So, z² -x² -x λ z + λ x² =0

Let me factor terms:

z² -x² + λ ( -x z +x² )=0

Hmm, we can write this as z² -x² + λ x (x - z )=0

Not sure if helpful. Perhaps I can factor this differently.

Alternatively, let's try to collect terms with λ:

z² -x² + λ (x² - x z )=0

So,

λ (x² -x z ) = x² - z²

Thus,

λ = (x² - z² ) / (x² - x z )

Simplify denominator:

x² - x z = x(x - z )

Numerator: x² - z² = (x - z)(x + z )

Thus,

λ = [ (x - z)(x + z) ] / [ x (x - z) ] = (x + z ) / x, provided x ≠ z.

So, λ = (x + z ) / x = 1 + z / x

So, now, from Equation 1, we can express μ in terms of x, z, and λ.

We had earlier:

μ = [2x - 2λ(x + z)] / (xz )

Substitute λ = (x + z)/x:

μ = [2x - 2*( (x + z)/x )*(x + z) ] / (xz )

Simplify numerator:

2x - 2*( (x + z)^2 ) / x

So,

μ = [ 2x - 2(x² + 2x z + z² ) / x ] / (xz )

= [ (2x^2 ) - 2(x² + 2x z + z² ) ] / (x z )

Expand numerator:

2x² - 2x² -4x z -2 z² = -4x z -2 z²

Thus,

μ = (-4x z -2 z² ) / (x z ) = - (4x z + 2 z² ) / (x z )

Factor z in numerator:

= - z (4x + 2 z ) / (x z ) = - (4x + 2 z ) / x = -4 - (2 z ) / x

So, μ = -4 - (2 z ) / x

Now, let's remember that we have the constraint xyz =23. Since x = y, this becomes x² z =23.

So, z = 23 / x²

So, substitute z =23/x² into the expressions for λ and μ.

First, λ = 1 + z/x = 1 + (23/x² ) / x = 1 + 23 / x^3

Wait, that can't be right. Wait, z =23/x², so z/x =23/(x^3)

Wait, no, because z/x is (23/x² ) /x =23/x^3. So, λ =1 + 23/x^3.

Wait, let me recompute.

Wait, λ =1 + z/x. Since z =23/x², then z/x =23/(x^3). So, yes, λ =1 +23/(x^3).

Similarly, μ = -4 - (2 z)/x = -4 - (2*(23/x² )) /x = -4 -46/(x^3 )

So, now, let's see if we can find x.

We also have the surface area constraint: 2(xy + yz + xz )=54. Since x=y, this is 2(x² + 2xz )=54 → x² + 2x z =27.

But z=23/x², so substituting:

x² + 2x*(23/x² )=27 → x² +46/x =27. Which is the same equation I had earlier: x³ -27x +46=0.

Which we already solved, the roots are x=2 and x= -1 ±2√6.

So, the possible x's are x=2 and x= -1 +2√6 (≈3.898). So, the only positive roots are x=2 and x≈3.898.

So, let's compute λ and μ for these cases.

Case 1: x=2.

Then, z=23/(2)^2=23/4=5.75.

λ =1 +23/(2)^3=1 +23/8= (8 +23)/8=31/8=3.875.

μ= -4 -46/(2)^3= -4 -46/8= -4 -5.75= -9.75.

So, now, let's check if these satisfy the third equation, which we derived from the Lagrangian.

Wait, no, we already used the constraints to find x and z, so perhaps they are consistent. Since we already derived the values of x, y, z, we can proceed.

Case 2: x= -1 +2√6≈3.898.

Compute z=23/(x² ). Let's compute x²:

x= -1 +2√6, so x²=( -1 +2√6 )²=1 -4√6 + (2√6 )²=1 -4√6 +24=25 -4√6.

Thus, z=23/(25 -4√6 ). As before, which is approximately 1.513.

Then, λ =1 +23/(x^3 ). Hmm, x^3 is (−1 +2√6 )^3. Let me compute that.

Alternatively, since x^3= (x)(x² )=x*(25 -4√6 )= (−1 +2√6 )(25 -4√6 )

Multiply out:

= (-1)(25) + (-1)(-4√6 ) +2√6 *25 +2√6 * (-4√6 )

= -25 +4√6 +50√6 -8*(6)

= -25 +54√6 -48

= (-25 -48 ) +54√6 = -73 +54√6.

So, x^3= -73 +54√6.

Thus, 23/x^3=23/( -73 +54√6 )

Hmm, let me rationalize that.

Multiply numerator and denominator by ( -73 -54√6 ):

23*( -73 -54√6 ) / [ ( -73 )² - (54√6 )² ]

Compute denominator:

73²=5329, and (54√6 )²=54² *6=2916*6=17496.

So, denominator=5329 -17496= -12167.

Thus, 23/x^3= [23*(-73 -54√6 ) ] / (-12167 )= [ -1679 -1242√6 ] / (-12167 )= (1679 +1242√6 ) /12167.

Simplify: numerator and denominator can be divided by GCD(1679,12167). Let me check if 1679 divides into 12167.

12167 ÷1679 ≈7.24, so not exactly. Maybe 1679 is prime. Let me check.

1679 ÷13=129.15... Not integer. 1679 ÷7≈239.85, nope. 1679 ÷17≈98.76, nope. 1679 ÷ 23≈73, exactly, because 23*73=1679.

Yes, 23*73=1679. So, numerator is 23*(73 +54√6 )

Denominator is 12167=23^3=23*23*23=12167.

So, 23/x^3= [23*(73 +54√6 ) ] /23^3= (73 +54√6 ) /23^2= (73 +54√6 ) /529.

So, λ=1 + (73 +54√6 ) /529= (529 +73 +54√6 ) /529= (602 +54√6 ) /529.

Similarly, μ= -4 -46/x^3.

Compute 46/x^3=46/( -73 +54√6 )= same as before, but multiplied by 2.

Wait, 46=2*23, so 46/x^3=2*(23/x^3 )=2*(73 +54√6 )/529= (146 +108√6 ) /529.

So, μ= -4 - (146 +108√6 ) /529.

Convert -4 to over 529: -4= -2116/529.

So, μ= (-2116 -146 -108√6 ) /529= (-2262 -108√6 ) /529.

Now, perhaps it's better to leave it as it is.

But perhaps I can check if these values satisfy the third equation.

Wait, but since we've already used the constraints, perhaps they do. So, maybe these are valid.

So, from the two cases, when x=2, we get a space diagonal of sqrt(4 +4 + (5.75)^2 )=sqrt(41.0625)=6.408.

When x= -1 +2√6≈3.898, the space diagonal is sqrt( (3.898)^2 + (3.898)^2 + (1.513)^2 )≈sqrt(15.193 +15.193 +2.289)=sqrt(32.675)=5.716.

So, the first case gives a larger space diagonal. So, perhaps the maximum occurs when two variables are equal and the third is different.

But wait, is there a case where all variables are different that gives a larger space diagonal?

Alternatively, perhaps the maximum occurs when two variables are equal, as we found, and that's the maximum.

Alternatively, maybe when the box is a cube, but as we saw earlier, the cube would have volume 27, which is higher than 23, so it's not applicable here.

Alternatively, perhaps the maximum occurs when one variable is as large as possible, and the other two as small as possible, but constrained by the surface area and volume.

Wait, but for a given surface area and volume, making one side longer would require the other sides to be shorter, but how does that affect the space diagonal?

Let me think: the space diagonal is sqrt(x² + y² + z² ). So, if one variable increases while others decrease, it's not clear whether the sum of squares increases or decreases.

Alternatively, perhaps we can use some inequality to relate the sum of squares, surface area, and volume.

We know that for positive real numbers, the sum of squares is minimized when variables are equal, but here we want the maximum.

But I'm not sure about the maximum. Alternatively, we can use the method of Lagrange multipliers, but it's complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps we can parameterize the problem.

Let me consider the variables x, y, z, with surface area 2(xy + yz +xz )=54, volume xyz=23.

We can let x, y, z be positive real numbers.

We can also consider that for a given surface area, the volume is maximized when x=y=z, but here the volume is fixed, so perhaps the shape deviates from the cube.

Alternatively, perhaps using the inequality between quadratic and cubic means.

Wait, not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps I can express the sum x² + y² + z² in terms of the surface area and the volume.

We know that (x + y + z )² =x² + y² + z² + 2(xy + yz +xz )

So, x² + y² + z² = (x + y + z )² - 2(xy + yz + xz )= (x + y + z )² -54.

So, to maximize x² + y² + z², we need to maximize (x + y + z )².

So, we can instead try to maximize x + y + z, given the constraints.

So, the problem reduces to maximizing x + y + z, with 2(xy + yz + xz )=54 and xyz=23.

Hmm, perhaps that's easier.

So, we need to maximize S =x + y + z, given that 2(xy + yz + xz )=54 and xyz=23.

Let me denote P =x + y + z, Q=xy + yz + xz=27, and R=xyz=23.

We can think of x, y, z as the roots of the cubic equation t³ - P t² + Q t - R =0 → t³ - P t² +27 t -23=0.

We need to find the maximum possible value of P, given that the cubic has three positive real roots.

So, the cubic equation must have three positive real roots. So, we can use the theory of equations to find the conditions on P.

For the cubic equation t³ - P t² +27 t -23=0 to have three positive real roots, the following must hold:

1. The cubic must have three real roots. So, its discriminant must be non-negative.

The discriminant D of a cubic equation t³ + a t² + b t +c =0 is given by D=18 a b c -4 a³ c +a² b² -4 b³ -27 c².

Wait, let me check the exact formula, because I might be mixing up the coefficients.

Wait, for equation t³ + pt² + qt + r =0, the discriminant is:

Δ = 18 p q r -4 p³ r +p² q² -4 q³ -27 r².

Wait, but in our case, the equation is t³ - P t² +27 t -23=0.

So, p= -P, q=27, r= -23.

Plugging into the discriminant formula:

Δ = 18*(-P)*27*(-23) -4*(-P)^3*(-23) + (-P)^2*(27)^2 -4*(27)^3 -27*(-23)^2.

This seems complicated, but let me compute each term step by step.

First term: 18*(-P)*27*(-23) =18*P*27*23.

Second term: -4*(-P)^3*(-23)= -4*(-P)^3*(-23)= -4*(-P)^3*(-23)= -4*(P^3)*(23)= -92 P³.

Wait, let me double-check:

Wait, the term is -4 p³ r.

Given p= -P, r= -23.

So, -4*(-P)^3*(-23)= -4*(-P)^3*(-23)= -4*(-1)^3 P^3*(-23)= -4*(-1) P^3*(-23)= -4*( -P^3 )*(-23)= -4*P^3*23= -92 P^3.

Third term: p² q²= (-P)^2*(27)^2= P²*729.

Fourth term: -4 q³= -4*(27)^3= -4*19683= -78732.

Fifth term: -27 r²= -27*( -23 )²= -27*529= -14283.

Putting all together:

Δ = (18*P*27*23 ) + (-92 P³ ) + (729 P² ) + (-78732 ) + (-14283 )

Compute each term numerically.

First term: 18*27=486; 486*23=11,178. So, 11,178 P.

Second term: -92 P³.

Third term: 729 P².

Fourth term: -78,732.

Fifth term: -14,283.

So, Δ=11178 P -92 P³ +729 P² -78732 -14283.

Combine constants: -78732 -14283= -93,015.

So, Δ= -92 P³ +729 P² +11178 P -93015.

For the cubic to have three real roots, the discriminant must be non-negative:

-92 P³ +729 P² +11178 P -93015 ≥0.

This is a cubic inequality in P, which is complicated to solve. Maybe we can find the maximum P numerically.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to use the method of Lagrange multipliers again.

Wait, but maybe I can consider that when x, y, z are all positive real numbers, the maximum of P occurs when variables are equal or when two are equal.

Wait, earlier when I assumed x=y, I found P= x + x + z=2x +23/(x² )

So, P=2x +23/x².

We can find the maximum of this function.

Wait, but wait, actually, we were trying to maximize P, so perhaps for x=y, P=2x +23/x², and we can find the value of x that maximizes P.

Wait, but earlier, when I did the optimization assuming x=y, I found the x that satisfied the constraints, but perhaps that was for the case when we were minimizing or maximizing something else.

Wait, no, when I assumed x=y, I derived the possible x's, but for each x, P=2x +z=2x +23/x².

So, let me consider P(x)=2x +23/x².

To find its maximum, take derivative with respect to x:

P’(x)=2 -46/x³.

Set to zero: 2 -46/x³=0 → 2=46/x³ → x³=23 → x=∛23≈2.843.

So, the function P(x) has a critical point at x=∛23, but is it a maximum or a minimum?

Second derivative: P''(x)=0 + 138/x^4.

Since P''(x) is positive for x>0, this critical point is a minimum.

So, P(x) has a minimum at x=∛23, so the maximum occurs at the endpoints.

But x can't be too small or too large.

Wait, as x approaches zero, 23/x² approaches infinity, so P(x) approaches infinity. But in reality, x can't be zero because then volume would be zero, which contradicts xyz=23.

Wait, but in reality, x can't be zero, but as x approaches zero, the other dimensions blow up, but the surface area is fixed, so perhaps it's not possible.

Wait, perhaps there's a lower bound on x.

Wait, let me think: when x approaches zero, z=23/(x² ) approaches infinity, but the surface area is fixed at 54.

So, 2(x² + 2xz )=54 → x² +2x z=27. If x approaches zero, then 2x z approaches 27, so z approaches 27/(2x ), which also approaches infinity as x approaches zero.

But this would require the surface area term 2(xy + yz +xz )=54, but with x approaching zero, and z approaching infinity, the term yz would dominate, but y=x, so y approaches zero, so yz would approach zero. Wait, no, y=x, so as x approaches zero, y approaches zero, but z approaches infinity. So, the term yz would approach zero, as y approaches zero faster than z approaches infinity.

Wait, but in reality, with x approaching zero, and x=y, the surface area equation becomes x² + 2x z=27, so z=(27 -x² )/(2x ). As x approaches zero, z approaches 27/(2x ) → infinity.

So, the volume is x² z=23. Substituting z=27/(2x ) -x²/(2x )=27/(2x ) -x/2.

So, x²*(27/(2x ) -x/2 )=23 → x*(27/(2x ) -x/2 )=23 → (27/2 -x²/2 )=23.

So, 27/2 -x²/2 =23 → multiply both sides by 2: 27 -x²=46 → x²=27-46= -19, which is impossible. So, x cannot approach zero because it would require x² negative, which is impossible.

Thus, x must be at least some positive value where x² ≤27.

Wait, but for the surface area equation, x² + 2x z=27 → z=(27 -x² )/(2x ), so 27 -x² must be positive, so x² <27 →x <sqrt(27 )≈5.196.

So, x can vary between some lower bound and up to sqrt(27 ).

But when x approaches sqrt(27 ), z approaches (27 -27)/(2*sqrt(27 ))=0.

So, x can't be larger than sqrt(27 ), otherwise z would be negative, which is impossible.

Thus, x must be in (0, sqrt(27 )).

So, with that in mind, the function P(x)=2x +23/x² has its minimum at x=∛23≈2.843, and as x approaches 0, P(x) approaches infinity, but in reality, x can't approach zero because it would violate the volume constraint.

Wait, but earlier, when x approaches zero, the volume equation would require z to approach infinity, but that leads to a contradiction in the surface area equation, as shown earlier.

Thus, perhaps the maximum of P(x)=2x +23/x² occurs at the endpoints, i.e., at the minimal and maximal possible x.

Wait, but in reality, the maximum value of x is sqrt(27 )≈5.196, but when x approaches sqrt(27 ), z approaches zero, and the volume x² z=23 would require z=23/(x² ) approaching 23/27≈0.851.

Wait, no, if x approaches sqrt(27 ), then z=23/x² approaches 23/27≈0.851.

So, let's compute P(x) at x= sqrt(27 )=3√3≈5.196.

Then, P=2*(5.196 ) +23/(5.196 )² ≈10.392 +23/(27 )≈10.392 +0.851≈11.243.

But earlier, when x=2, P=2*2 +23/(2 )²=4 +23/4=4 +5.75=9.75.

Wait, but when x= -1 +2√6≈3.898, let's compute P=2x + z=2*(3.898 ) + z.

z=23/(x² )=23/(25 -4√6 )≈23/(25 -9.798 )=23/15.202≈1.513.

So, P≈2*3.898 +1.513≈7.796 +1.513≈9.309.

Wait, that's less than when x=2, which gave P=9.75.

Wait, but when x= sqrt(27 )≈5.196, P≈11.243, which is higher than 9.75.

But wait, earlier, when x=5.196, z=23/(27 )≈0.851.

But in that case, the space diagonal would be sqrt( (5.196 )^2 + (5.196 )^2 + (0.851 )^2 )≈sqrt(27 +27 +0.724 )=sqrt(54.724 )≈7.398, which is less than the case when x=2, which had a space diagonal of ~6.408. Wait, no, 7.398 is larger than 6.408.

Wait, that suggests that if x can approach 5.196, then the space diagonal can be up to approximately7.398, which is larger than the previous case.

But wait, earlier when I assumed x=y, I found that when x=2, the space diagonal is sqrt(4 +4 + (5.75)^2 )=sqrt(41.0625 )=6.408, and when x=3.898, it's sqrt(15.193 +15.193 +2.289 )=sqrt(32.675 )≈5.716.

But if x can be up to ~5.196, then the space diagonal would be sqrt(5.196² +5.196² +0.851² )=sqrt(27 +27 +0.724 )=sqrt(54.724 )≈7.398.

But this suggests that the space diagonal can be larger than 6.408, which was the case when x=2 and y=2, z=5.75.

So, perhaps the maximum space diagonal is achieved when one of the variables is as large as possible, i.e., approaching sqrt(27 ), and the other two variables are approaching zero.

Wait, but in that case, the volume would be x*y*z= x*(x)*(z )=x² z=23.

As x approaches sqrt(27 ), z approaches 23/27≈0.851.

So, in that case, the space diagonal would approach sqrt( (sqrt(27 ))^2 + (sqrt(27 ))^2 + (0.851 )^2 )=sqrt(27 +27 +0.724 )=sqrt(54.724 )≈7.398.

But is this the maximum?

Alternatively, perhaps the maximum occurs when two variables are as unequal as possible.

Wait, perhaps the maximum occurs when one variable is as large as possible, and the other two are as small as possible, given the constraints.

Wait, but to check that, perhaps I can consider the function x² + y² + z², given the constraints.

Wait, another approach: using the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality.

We know that (x + y + z )² ≤3(x² + y² + z² ), but that might not help here.

Alternatively, perhaps I can express x² + y² + z² in terms of the surface area and the volume.

Wait, we have:

(x + y + z )² =x² + y² + z² + 2(xy + yz +xz )=x² + y² + z² +54.

So, x² + y² + z² = (x + y + z )² -54.

We need to maximize x² + y² + z², which is equivalent to maximizing (x + y + z )².

So, the problem reduces to maximizing (x + y + z )², which is equivalent to maximizing x + y + z.

So, now, the problem is to maximize x + y + z, given that 2(xy + yz +xz )=54 and xyz=23.

So, perhaps using the method of Lagrange multipliers again, but I think I need a different approach.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use the AM ≥ GM inequality.

But I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps I can let u =x + y + z, v=xy + yz +xz=27, w=xyz=23.

We can think of u as the variable to maximize, given v and w.

In the case of three variables, the maximum u given v and w can be found by considering the cubic equation with roots x, y, z.

The cubic equation is t³ - u t² + v t -w=0 → t³ -u t² +27 t -23=0.

For this cubic to have three positive real roots, the discriminant must be non-negative, as I started earlier.

So, the discriminant D= -92 u³ +729 u² +11178 u -93015 ≥0.

I need to solve this inequality for u.

But solving a cubic inequality is difficult without knowing the roots.

Alternatively, perhaps I can estimate the maximum u.

From earlier, when x approaches sqrt(27 ), u approaches 2*sqrt(27 ) +23/(27 )≈5.196*2 +0.851≈10.392 +0.851≈11.243.

When x=2, u=2+2+5.75=9.75.

When x≈3.898, u≈3.898+3.898+1.513≈9.309.

Wait, so the maximum u seems to approach approximately11.243 as x approaches sqrt(27 ).

But let me check if u can be higher.

Alternatively, perhaps the maximum occurs at some point where x is not equal to y.

But I think that when x approaches sqrt(27 ), u approaches approximately11.243, which is higher than when x=2.

So, perhaps the maximum u is around11.243.

But to find the exact maximum, perhaps I can set up the derivative of u with respect to x, given the constraints.

Wait, but u is a function of x, y, z, which are interdependent.

Alternatively, perhaps I can parameterize two variables and express the third in terms of them.

Let me consider x and y as variables, then z=23/(x y ).

Substituting into the surface area equation:

2(xy + y*(23/(x y )) + x*(23/(x y )) )=54 → 2[ xy +23/x +23/y ]=54 → xy +23/x +23/y=27.

So, we have:

xy +23/x +23/y=27.

We need to maximize u=x + y + z= x + y +23/(x y ).

So, the problem becomes: maximize u=x + y +23/(x y ), subject to xy +23/x +23/y=27.

This seems quite complicated, but perhaps I can make a substitution.

Let me let a=x, b=y.

Then, the constraint is ab +23/a +23/b=27.

We can write this as ab +23(1/a +1/b )=27.

Let me denote s= a + b, and p=ab.

Then, 1/a +1/b=(a +b )/(ab )=s/p.

So, the constraint becomes p +23*(s/p )=27.

So, p + (23 s )/p=27.

Multiply both sides by p: p² +23 s=27 p.

Thus, p² -27 p +23 s=0.

We need to express s in terms of p.

But, we also have u= a +b +23/(ab )=s +23/p.

So, to maximize u=s +23/p, we need to find s and p such that p² -27 p +23 s=0 and s is expressed in terms of p.

From p² -27 p +23 s=0 → s=(27 p -p² )/23.

So, u= s +23/p= (27 p -p² )/23 +23/p.

So, u= (27 p -p² )/23 +23/p.

Now, we can consider u as a function of p:

u(p )= (27 p -p² )/23 +23/p.

We need to find the maximum value of u(p ).

To find the maximum, take derivative of u with respect to p and set to zero.

Compute u’(p ):

u’(p )= [27 -2p ]/23 + (-23)/p².

Set u’(p )=0:

[27 -2p ]/23 -23/p²=0.

Multiply both sides by 23 p² to eliminate denominators:

(27 -2p ) p² -529=0.

So, 27 p² -2 p³ -529=0.

Rearranged: -2 p³ +27 p² -529=0 → 2 p³ -27 p² +529=0.

We need to solve 2 p³ -27 p² +529=0.

This is a cubic equation in p. Let's try to find rational roots using Rational Root Theorem.

Possible rational roots are factors of 529 over factors of 2. 529=23², so possible roots are ±1, ±23, ±529, ±1/2, ±23/2, ±529/2.

Let me test p=23/2=11.5.

Compute 2*(11.5 )³ -27*(11.5 )² +529.

Compute 11.5³= (11 +0.5 )³=1331 + 3*121*0.5 +3*11*(0.5 )² +0.5³= 1331 + 181.5 + 8.25 +0.125=1331+181.5=1512.5+8.25=1520.75+0.125=1520.875.

So, 2*1520.875=3041.75.

11.5²=132.25. 27*132.25=27*132 +27*0.25=3564 +6.75=3570.75.

So, 2 p³ -27 p² +529=3041.75 -3570.75 +529= (3041.75 -3570.75 ) +529= (-529 ) +529=0.

So, p=23/2=11.5 is a root.

So, we can factor the cubic as (p -11.5 )(quadratic ).

Using polynomial division or synthetic division.

Divide 2 p³ -27 p² +529 by (p -11.5 ).

Alternatively, write as:

2p³ -27 p² +0 p +529 divided by p -11.5.

Using synthetic division:

11.5 | 2   -27     0      529

Multiply and add:

Bring down 2.

2*(11.5 )=23 → add to -27 → -4.

-4*(11.5 )= -46 → add to 0 → -46.

-46*(11.5 )= -539 → add to 529 → -10.

Wait, that doesn't give zero. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps I should use the exact root p=23/2.

Let me perform polynomial division.

Divide 2p³ -27 p² +0 p +529 by p -23/2.

Let me write the cubic as:

2p³ -27 p² +0 p +529.

Divide by p -23/2.

Using polynomial long division:

Divide 2p³ by p → 2p². Multiply divisor (p -23/2 ) by 2p² → 2p³ -23 p².

Subtract from dividend:

(2p³ -27 p² ) - (2p³ -23 p² )= (-27 p² +23 p² )= -4 p².

Bring down the next term: 0 p.

So, now we have -4 p² +0 p.

Divide -4 p² by p → -4 p.

Multiply divisor by -4 p → -4 p² +46 p.

Subtract:

(-4 p² +0 p ) - (-4 p² +46 p )= 0 p² -46 p.

Bring down the next term: +529.

Now, we have -46 p +529.

Divide -46 p by p → -46.

Multiply divisor by -46 → -46 p +527.

Subtract:

(-46 p +529 ) - (-46 p +527 )= 0 p +2.

So, remainder is 2, which suggests that p=23/2 is not a root, which contradicts earlier calculation.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the synthetic division.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use exact fractions.

Let me try p=23/2.

Compute 2*(23/2 )³ -27*(23/2 )² +529.

Compute (23/2 )³= (23 )³/(2 )³=12167 /8.

So, 2*(12167 /8 )=24334 /8=12167 /4.

(23/2 )²=529 /4.

27*(529 /4 )=14283 /4.

So, expression becomes:

12167 /4 -14283 /4 +529.

Compute 12167 -14283= -2116.

So, -2116 /4 +529= -529 +529=0.

Yes, p=23/2 is a root.

So, the cubic factors as (p -23/2 )(2p² + a p +b )=0.

To find a and b, let's multiply out:

(p -23/2 )(2p² +a p +b )=2p³ +a p² +b p -23/2 *2 p² -23/2 a p -23/2 b.

=2p³ +a p² +b p -23 p² - (23 a /2 ) p - (23 b )/2.

Combine like terms:

2p³ + (a -23 )p² + (b -23 a /2 ) p - (23 b )/2.

This should equal 2 p³ -27 p² +0 p +529.

So, equating coefficients:

a -23 = -27 → a= -4.

b -23 a /2=0 → b -23*(-4)/2= b +46=0 → b= -46.

-23 b /2=529 → -23*(-46 )/2= (1058 )/2=529, which matches.

So, the cubic factors as (p -23/2 )(2p² -4 p -46 )=0.

Set equal to zero: p=23/2 or roots of 2p² -4 p -46=0.

Solve 2p² -4p -46=0 → p² -2p -23=0.

Using quadratic formula: p= [2 ±sqrt(4 +92 )]/2= [2 ±sqrt(96 )]/2= [2 ±4√6 ]/2=1 ±2√6.

Since p=xy must be positive, we discard the negative root: p=1 +2√6≈1+4.899≈5.899.

So, the critical points are p=23/2=11.5 and p=1 +2√6≈5.899.

Now, we can compute u(p ) at these critical points.

Case 1: p=23/2=11.5.

Then, s=(27 p -p² )/23= (27*11.5 - (11.5 )² )/23.

Compute 27*11.5=27*(10 +1.5 )=270 +40.5=310.5.

(11.5 )²=132.25.

So, numerator=310.5 -132.25=178.25.

s=178.25 /23=7.75.

So, u= s +23/p=7.75 +23/11.5=7.75 +2=9.75.

Case 2: p=1 +2√6≈5.899.

Compute s=(27 p -p² )/23.

Compute p²=(1 +2√6 )²=1 +4√6 +24=25 +4√6≈25+9.798≈34.798.

27 p≈27*(5.899 )≈160.273.

So, numerator≈160.273 -34.798≈125.475.

s≈125.475 /23≈5.455.

Then, u≈5.455 +23/p≈5.455 +23/5.899≈5.455 +3.9≈9.355.

So, the maximum u occurs at p=23/2=11.5, with u=9.75.

So, the maximum value of x + y + z is 9.75, achieved when p=11.5, which corresponds to x= y=2, z=5.75, as found earlier.

Wait, but earlier when I thought that as x approaches sqrt(27 ), u approaches ~11.243, but according to this analysis, the maximum u is 9.75, achieved at x=2, y=2, z=5.75.

This suggests that the earlier assumption that u can approach ~11.243 is incorrect, and the actual maximum is 9.75.

So, perhaps the maximum space diagonal is achieved when x=2, y=2, z=5.75, giving a space diagonal of sqrt(4 +4 +33.0625 )=sqrt(41.0625 )=6.408.

But wait, earlier I thought that when x approaches sqrt(27 ), u approaches ~11.243, but according to the cubic equation solution, the maximum u is 9.75.

So, perhaps the maximum occurs when x=y=2, z=5.75, giving u=9.75.

Thus, the maximum x² + y² + z² is u² -54= (9.75 )² -54=95.0625 -54=41.0625.

So, the maximum space diagonal squared is 41.0625, which is 41.0625= 41 + 0.0625= 41 + 1/16= (41*16 +1 )/16= (656 +1 )/16=657/16.

Wait, 657 and 16: 657 ÷16=41.0625.

Yes, so 41.0625=657/16.

Thus, r^2= (space diagonal )^2 /4= (657/16 ) /4=657/(16*4 )=657/64.

Check if 657 and 64 are coprime.

64 is 2^6. 657 ÷3=219, so 657=3*219=3*3*73. 73 is a prime. So, 657 and 64 share no common factors besides 1.

Thus, r^2=657/64, so p=657, q=64, p+q=657+64=721.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To solve the problem, we need to find the radius \( r \) of the smallest sphere that can contain any rectangular box with a surface area of 54 and a volume of 23. The value of \( r^2 \) is expressed as a fraction \( \frac{p}{q} \), and we need to find \( p + q \).

### Key Steps:

1. **Define Variables**: Let the dimensions of the rectangular box be \( x, y, z \). The surface area constraint is \( 2(xy + yz + xz) = 54 \), and the volume constraint is \( xyz = 23 \).

2. **Space Diagonal**: The space diagonal of the box is \( \sqrt{x^2 + y^2 + z^2} \). The radius \( r \) of the smallest enclosing sphere is half of this diagonal, so \( r = \frac{\sqrt{x^2 + y^2 + z^2}}{2} \).

3. **Maximize Space Diagonal**: To find the smallest enclosing sphere, we need to maximize the space diagonal. This is equivalent to maximizing \( x^2 + y^2 + z^2 \).

4. **Use Constraints**: Using the surface area and volume constraints, we express \( x^2 + y^2 + z^2 \) in terms of \( x + y + z \) and other known quantities.

5. **Lagrange Multipliers and Optimization**: By setting up the problem with Lagrange multipliers and solving the resulting equations, we find that the maximum space diagonal occurs when two dimensions are equal (\( x = y = 2 \)) and the third dimension is \( z = 5.75 \).

6. **Calculate Space Diagonal**: For \( x = y = 2 \) and \( z = 5.75 \), the space diagonal is \( \sqrt{2^2 + 2^2 + 5.75^2} = \sqrt{41.0625} \).

7. **Compute \( r^2 \)**: The radius squared is \( \frac{41.0625}{4} = \frac{657}{64} \).

8. **Final Answer**: The fraction \( \frac{657}{64} \) is in simplest terms, so \( p = 657 \) and \( q = 64 \). Thus, \( p + q = 721 \).

### Final Answer:
\boxed{721}
