Okay, so I've got this problem about counting paths on an 8x8 grid. The paths are from the lower left corner to the upper right corner, with a length of 16 steps. And the condition is that they change direction exactly four times. Hmm, let me try to unpack this.

First, I remember that in grid path problems, each path is a sequence of moves, usually right (R) and up (U). For an 8x8 grid, moving from the lower left to upper right requires 8 rights and 8 ups, in some order. So the total number of paths without any restrictions is the combination C(16,8), which is 12870. But here, the condition is about changing direction exactly four times. That complicates things.

Wait, changing direction exactly four times. So, what does that mean? Each time the path changes direction, it switches from moving right to up or vice versa. So, for example, if a path goes RRRUUURRUU, that's a few direction changes. Let me count: R to U after the first three Rs, then U to R after five Us, then R to U again. That's two changes. Hmm, so the number of direction changes is one less than the number of runs. Wait, runs mean consecutive same moves. So each run is a consecutive sequence of same steps. So, if you have k direction changes, that would split the path into k+1 runs.

Wait, right. So, for a path that changes direction four times, the number of runs would be five. Because each direction change signifies the start of a new run. So, for four direction changes, there are five runs. So, the path is made up of five runs, each of which is either all rights or all ups.

Now, the problem is to count the number of such paths with exactly four direction changes, meaning five runs. But each run must consist of at least one step, right? Because you can't have a run of zero steps.

So, each run is at least length one. So, the path consists of five runs, each of length at least one, and the total number of right steps is 8 and up steps is 8.

Wait, so the entire path must be a combination of right and up runs. So, the five runs are alternately right and up, but which direction starts first? Because the path starts at the lower left corner, so the first move could be right or up, depending on how it's constructed.

Wait, but in the problem statement, it's on an 8x8 grid. So, the starting point is (0,0) and the ending point is (8,8). So, the path should consist of 8 right moves and 8 up moves, in some order, but divided into runs of consecutive rights or ups, with exactly four direction changes. So, the number of runs is five.

So, if I think of the runs, they alternate between right and up. So, the first run could be right or up, and then the next run alternates. So, the number of runs is five, so the number of direction changes is four.

So, to model this, I can think of the path as starting with either a right run or an up run, then alternating. So, if it starts with a right run, the runs would be R, U, R, U, R. That's five runs, four direction changes. Alternatively, starting with an up run, the runs would be U, R, U, R, U.

So, the number of such paths starting with R is equal to the number starting with U, perhaps? Let me see. Since the total number of rights and ups is equal (8 each), the number of paths starting with R and having four direction changes should be equal to those starting with U.

So, perhaps I can calculate the number starting with R and then double it, but wait: no, because the starting direction could affect the counts, depending on the number of runs. Let me think.

Wait, the number of runs is five, which is odd. So, if the path starts with R, it will have three R runs and two U runs, because the runs alternate. Or is it the other way around?

Wait, let me see: starting with R, the runs would be R, U, R, U, R. So, 3 R runs and 2 U runs. Similarly, starting with U, it would be U, R, U, R, U: 3 U runs and 2 R runs. So, in each case, the number of runs for the starting direction is one more than the other.

So, for each starting direction, the number of runs for the starting direction is 3, and the other is 2.

But in this problem, since the total number of R and U steps is equal (8 each), the number of runs for R and U must satisfy certain conditions.

Wait, for example, if the path starts with R and has three R runs and two U runs, then the sum of the lengths of R runs is 8, and the sum of U runs is 8. Each R run is at least length 1, and each U run is at least length 1.

So, for R runs: 3 runs, each at least 1, summing to 8. Similarly for U runs: 2 runs, each at least 1, summing to 8.

So, the number of ways to split 8 R steps into 3 runs is C(8-1,3-1) = C(7,2) = 21. Similarly, for U steps into 2 runs: C(8-1,2-1) = C(7,1) =7. So, for each starting direction R, the number of such paths would be 21 *7=147.

Similarly, if the path starts with U, then U runs are 3, each at least 1, summing to 8: C(7,2)=21. R runs are 2, each at least 1, summing to 8: C(7,1)=7. So, the number of such paths starting with U is 21*7=147 as well.

So, total number of paths with exactly four direction changes would be 147 +147=294.

Wait, but let me verify that. So, the reasoning is, for each starting direction, the number of runs is 3 for the starting direction and 2 for the other, and the number of ways to partition steps is as above.

But let me check if I'm considering all possible cases correctly.

Alternatively, perhaps the number of runs is five, and the starting direction could be either R or U, as long as the total number of R and U steps is 8 each.

Wait, but for each starting direction, the number of runs for R and U depends on whether the number of runs is odd or even.

Wait, the number of runs is five, which is odd, so if starting with R, the number of R runs is (5+1)/2=3, and U runs is (5-1)/2=2. Similarly, starting with U, it would have 3 U runs and 2 R runs.

So, for each starting direction, the number of ways would be the product of the combinations for each direction.

So, for starting with R:

Number of ways to split 8 R into 3 runs: C(8-1,3-1)=C(7,2)=21.

Number of ways to split 8 U into 2 runs: C(8-1,2-1)=C(7,1)=7.

Multiply them together: 21 *7=147.

Similarly for starting with U: same calculation, 21 *7=147.

So total is 147 +147=294.

So, that's the total number of paths. So, the answer should be 294.

Wait, but let me think again: is there any overcounting or undercounting? Let me try to consider a smaller grid, say 2x2, and see if the method works.

For a 2x2 grid, the number of paths from (0,0) to (2,2) with exactly four direction changes. Wait, but for a 2x2 grid, the minimal path is 4 steps, so four direction changes would imply five runs, which is impossible because you can't have more runs than steps. Wait, maybe that's not the best example.

Alternatively, perhaps 3x3 grid. But maybe I should try a different approach.

Alternatively, maybe the formula is correct. Let me try to think of the general case.

So, for a grid of size n x n, the number of paths from (0,0) to (n,n) with exactly k direction changes. Wait, but in our problem, n=8, and the number of direction changes is four.

Wait, but let's think of it as the number of runs. So, the number of runs is k+1, where k is the number of direction changes. So, for four direction changes, five runs.

In each case, the number of runs for R and U depends on whether the starting direction is R or U. So, if the number of runs is five, which is odd, then starting with R would give (5+1)/2=3 R runs and 2 U runs. Similarly, starting with U, 3 U runs and 2 R runs.

The number of ways to split the R steps into 3 runs is C(8-1,3-1) = C(7,2)=21. Similarly, the U steps into 2 runs is C(7,1)=7. So, 21 *7=147. Similarly for starting with U, same number. So, total 294.

Thus, I think the answer is 294.

But to be thorough, let me consider another approach.

Alternatively, each path with exactly four direction changes must have five runs. So, let's model it as a sequence of runs: R, U, R, U, R or U, R, U, R, U.

Each run must have at least one step.

So, for each case, starting with R, we have three R runs and two U runs.

The sum of the lengths of R runs is 8, and each R run has at least 1, so the number of solutions is C(8-1,3-1)=C(7,2)=21.

Similarly, the sum of U runs is 8, with two runs, each at least 1: C(7,1)=7.

So, the number of such paths starting with R is 21 *7=147.

Similarly, starting with U, we have three U runs and two R runs.

Sum of U runs is 8, so C(7,2)=21.

Sum of R runs is 8, with two runs: C(7,1)=7.

So, 21*7=147.

Total number of paths: 147 +147=294.

So, yeah, that seems correct.

Wait, but let me think about the formula again.

In general, for a grid of size m x n, the number of paths from (0,0) to (m,n) with exactly k direction changes.

Wait, but in our problem, it's 8x8, so m=n=8, and k=4.

Wait, but in general, for such a problem, the number of paths with exactly k direction changes is 2 * C(m-1, a) * C(n-1, b), where a and b depend on the number of runs.

But perhaps I can model it more formally.

Each path is a sequence of runs. Each run is either R or U, and the runs alternate between R and U. So, starting with R, the runs are R, U, R, U, R (for five runs). Similarly, starting with U, the runs are U, R, U, R, U.

In either case, the number of R runs is three and U runs is two, or vice versa.

The number of ways to split the R steps into three runs is C(8-1,3-1)=C(7,2)=21.

The number of ways to split the U steps into two runs is C(8-1,2-1)=C(7,1)=7.

So, for each starting direction, it's 21*7=147.

Since starting direction can be R or U, the total is 147*2=294.

Therefore, the answer is 294.

I think I'm confident with that.

To solve the problem of counting paths of length 16 on an 8x8 grid that change direction exactly four times, we consider the following:

1. **Understanding Direction Changes**: A path changing direction exactly four times means it has five runs. Each run is a consecutive sequence of either right (R) or up (U) moves.

2. **Runs and Direction Changes**: The path alternates between R and U runs. Starting with R, the runs would be R, U, R, U, R (3 R runs and 2 U runs). Similarly, starting with U, the runs would be U, R, U, R, U (3 U runs and 2 R runs).

3. **Counting Paths**:
   - For paths starting with R:
     - Split 8 R steps into 3 runs: \( \binom{7}{2} = 21 \) ways.
     - Split 8 U steps into 2 runs: \( \binom{7}{1} = 7 \) ways.
     - Total paths starting with R: \( 21 \times 7 = 147 \).
   - For paths starting with U:
     - Split 8 U steps into 3 runs: \( \binom{7}{2} = 21 \) ways.
     - Split 8 R steps into 2 runs: \( \binom{7}{1} = 7 \) ways.
     - Total paths starting with U: \( 21 \times 7 = 147 \).

4. **Total Paths**: Adding both cases, the total number of paths is \( 147 + 147 = 294 \).

Thus, the number of such paths is \(\boxed{294}\).
