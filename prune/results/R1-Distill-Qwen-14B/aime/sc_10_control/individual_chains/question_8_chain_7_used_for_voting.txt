Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the number of triples of nonnegative integers (a, b, c) that satisfy two conditions: a + b + c = 300 and a²b + a²c + b²a + b²c + c²a + c²b = 6,000,000. Hmm, that seems a bit complicated, but let me try to break it down.

First, the equation a + b + c = 300 is straightforward. This means that the sum of the three variables is fixed at 300. So, I can think of this as partitioning 300 into three nonnegative integers. The number of such triples is a classic stars and bars problem, which is C(300 + 3 - 1, 3 - 1) = C(302, 2). But of course, not all of these will satisfy the second equation, so I need to find which ones do.

The second equation is a bit more complex: a²b + a²c + b²a + b²c + c²a + c²b = 6,000,000. Let me see if I can factor or simplify this expression. Looking at each term, I notice that each term is a product of two variables, one squared. So, for example, a²b and a²c both have a squared.

Wait, maybe I can factor this differently. Let me group the terms:

a²(b + c) + b²(a + c) + c²(a + b).

Yes, that makes sense. So, the equation becomes:

a²(b + c) + b²(a + c) + c²(a + b) = 6,000,000.

Hmm, but since a + b + c = 300, I can express (b + c) as (300 - a), (a + c) as (300 - b), and (a + b) as (300 - c). Let me substitute these into the equation.

So, the equation becomes:

a²(300 - a) + b²(300 - b) + c²(300 - c) = 6,000,000.

That's a bit better. Let me write it out:

300a² - a³ + 300b² - b³ + 300c² - c³ = 6,000,000.

Hmm, maybe I can factor out 300 from the first terms:

300(a² + b² + c²) - (a³ + b³ + c³) = 6,000,000.

So, 300(a² + b² + c²) - (a³ + b³ + c³) = 6,000,000.

Divide both sides by 300 to simplify:

(a² + b² + c²) - (a³ + b³ + c³)/300 = 20,000.

Hmm, not sure if that helps directly. Maybe I need a different approach.

Wait, another idea: perhaps express the original equation in terms of symmetric sums. Let's recall that symmetric sums can sometimes be manipulated using known identities.

Let's denote S1 = a + b + c = 300.

S2 = ab + bc + ca.

S3 = abc.

But how does that help with the given expression?

Wait, the original equation is a²b + a²c + b²a + b²c + c²a + c²b = 6,000,000.

Let me note that a²b + a²c = a²(b + c) = a²(300 - a), as I did earlier. Similarly for the other terms.

Alternatively, another thought: the expression a²b + a²c + b²a + b²c + c²a + c²b can be rewritten as ab(a + b) + bc(b + c) + ca(c + a). Hmm, but not sure if that helps.

Wait, maybe factor it as ab(a + b) + bc(b + c) + ca(c + a) = 6,000,000.

But since a + b + c = 300, a + b = 300 - c, similarly for the others.

So substituting:

ab(300 - c) + bc(300 - a) + ca(300 - b) = 6,000,000.

Hmm, that seems complicated, but maybe expanding it could lead somewhere.

Let's expand each term:

ab*300 - ab c + bc*300 - bc a + ca*300 - ca b.

So, 300(ab + bc + ca) - 3abc.

Which is 300 S2 - 3 S3 = 6,000,000.

Ah, now that's a useful expression!

So, 300 S2 - 3 S3 = 6,000,000.

Divide both sides by 3:

100 S2 - S3 = 2,000,000.

So, S3 = 100 S2 - 2,000,000.

Now, S1 = 300, S2 is the sum of the pairwise products, and S3 is the product of all three.

I know that for three variables, the elementary symmetric sums relate to each other in certain ways, and perhaps I can find another equation involving S1, S2, S3.

Wait, perhaps using the identity related to the sum of cubes.

Recall that:

a³ + b³ + c³ = (a + b + c)³ - 3(a + b + c)(ab + bc + ca) + 3abc.

So, a³ + b³ + c³ = S1³ - 3 S1 S2 + 3 S3.

We can compute S1³:

300³ = 27,000,000.

So, 3 S1 S2 = 3 * 300 * S2 = 900 S2.

And 3 S3 is just 3 S3.

So, a³ + b³ + c³ = 27,000,000 - 900 S2 + 3 S3.

But from the equation earlier, we have S3 = 100 S2 - 2,000,000.

So, let's substitute S3 into the sum of cubes:

a³ + b³ + c³ = 27,000,000 - 900 S2 + 3*(100 S2 - 2,000,000).

Compute that:

3*(100 S2 - 2,000,000) = 300 S2 - 6,000,000.

So, a³ + b³ + c³ = 27,000,000 - 900 S2 + 300 S2 - 6,000,000.

Simplify:

27,000,000 - 6,000,000 = 21,000,000.

-900 S2 + 300 S2 = -600 S2.

So, a³ + b³ + c³ = 21,000,000 - 600 S2.

Now, going back to the earlier equation I had, which was:

300(a² + b² + c²) - (a³ + b³ + c³) = 6,000,000.

Wait, let's compute a² + b² + c² in terms of S1 and S2.

We know that:

a² + b² + c² = (a + b + c)^2 - 2(ab + bc + ca) = S1² - 2 S2.

So, a² + b² + c² = 300² - 2 S2 = 90,000 - 2 S2.

Substituting back into the equation:

300*(90,000 - 2 S2) - (21,000,000 - 600 S2) = 6,000,000.

Compute each term:

300*90,000 = 27,000,000.

300*(-2 S2) = -600 S2.

So, 27,000,000 - 600 S2 - 21,000,000 + 600 S2 = 6,000,000.

Wait, let me compute this step by step.

First, 300*(90,000 - 2 S2) = 27,000,000 - 600 S2.

Then, subtract (21,000,000 - 600 S2):

So, 27,000,000 - 600 S2 - 21,000,000 + 600 S2.

Let's compute the constants: 27,000,000 - 21,000,000 = 6,000,000.

Now, the terms with S2: -600 S2 + 600 S2 = 0.

So, the entire expression becomes 6,000,000 = 6,000,000.

Wait, that's an identity. It doesn't give me any new information. Hmm, that's a problem. It means that my substitution led me to a tautology, which doesn't help me find S2 or S3.

So, perhaps I need another approach. Maybe I should consider specific cases or look for patterns.

Let me think about the possible values of a, b, c. Since a, b, c are nonnegative integers, and their sum is 300, each of them can range from 0 to 300.

But with the second equation, which is 300 S2 - 3 S3 = 6,000,000, or simplified as S3 = 100 S2 - 2,000,000.

Wait, since S3 must be nonnegative (as a product of nonnegative integers), 100 S2 - 2,000,000 ≥ 0. So, S2 ≥ 20,000.

Also, S2 has a maximum value. The maximum S2 occurs when two variables are as large as possible. For example, if a = b = 150 and c = 0, then S2 = ab + bc + ca = 150*150 + 150*0 + 150*0 = 22,500. Wait, but is that the maximum?

Wait, actually, the maximum of S2 occurs when two variables are as large as possible, given the constraint a + b + c = 300.

If I set a = b = 150, c = 0, S2 = 150*150 + 150*0 + 150*0 = 22,500.

Alternatively, if a = 299 and b = 1, c = 0, S2 = 299*1 + 1*0 + 299*0 = 299.

Wait, that's way smaller. So, the maximum S2 is 22,500, when a = b = 150, c = 0. So, S2 can range from 0 (if all are 0, but a + b + c = 300, so that's not possible) up to 22,500.

Wait, but we have S2 ≥ 20,000 from the earlier condition. So, S2 is in [20,000, 22,500].

So, S2 can be 20,000, 20,001, ..., up to 22,500.

That's a lot of possibilities, but maybe it's manageable.

But since S2 must be an integer because a, b, c are integers, so S2 is an integer.

Given that, S3 = 100 S2 - 2,000,000, so S3 must also be an integer.

So, for each S2 from 20,000 to 22,500, S3 is determined.

But how do I relate this to the variables a, b, c?

Wait, perhaps using the fact that S1, S2, S3 are the elementary symmetric sums, we can think of a, b, c as roots of a cubic equation.

Specifically, the monic cubic polynomial with roots a, b, c is x³ - S1 x² + S2 x - S3 = 0.

So, x³ - 300 x² + S2 x - (100 S2 - 2,000,000) = 0.

Simplify:

x³ - 300 x² + S2 x - 100 S2 + 2,000,000 = 0.

Factor out S2:

x³ - 300 x² + S2(x - 100) + 2,000,000 = 0.

Not sure if that helps.

Alternatively, maybe I can think of this as:

x³ - 300 x² + S2 x - (100 S2 - 2,000,000) = 0.

Hmm, perhaps I can factor this equation.

Let me try to factor by grouping:

Take the first two terms: x³ - 300 x² = x²(x - 300).

Then, the next two terms: S2 x - 100 S2 = S2(x - 100).

So, equation becomes:

x²(x - 300) + S2(x - 100) + 2,000,000 = 0.

Not sure if that's helpful.

Wait, maybe I can treat it as a cubic in x, but that might not be straightforward.

Alternatively, perhaps I can consider that a, b, c are integers, so the cubic must factor into integers.

But without knowing the roots, that seems difficult.

Wait, perhaps another approach: think about the variables a, b, c in terms of their values.

Given that a + b + c = 300, and S2 is around 20,000 to 22,500.

Let me think about the possible values of a, b, c.

Suppose that two of them are equal. Maybe that could simplify the problem.

Let me suppose that a = b. Then, since a + b + c = 300, c = 300 - 2a.

Then, S2 = ab + bc + ca = a² + 2a c = a² + 2a(300 - 2a) = a² + 600a - 4a² = -3a² + 600a.

Similarly, S3 = abc = a * a * c = a² (300 - 2a).

So, substituting into S3 = 100 S2 - 2,000,000:

a² (300 - 2a) = 100*(-3a² + 600a) - 2,000,000.

Let me compute the right-hand side:

100*(-3a² + 600a) = -300a² + 60,000a.

So,

a² (300 - 2a) = -300a² + 60,000a - 2,000,000.

Left side: 300a² - 2a³.

Right side: -300a² + 60,000a - 2,000,000.

Bring all terms to left:

300a² - 2a³ + 300a² - 60,000a + 2,000,000 = 0.

Combine like terms:

600a² - 2a³ - 60,000a + 2,000,000 = 0.

Divide both sides by -2 to simplify:

-300a² + a³ + 30,000a - 1,000,000 = 0.

Rearranged:

a³ - 300a² + 30,000a - 1,000,000 = 0.

Hmm, that's a cubic equation in a. Maybe I can factor this.

Let me try plugging in some integer values for a.

Let me try a = 100:

100³ - 300*(100)^2 + 30,000*100 - 1,000,000.

Compute each term:

1,000,000 - 300*10,000 + 3,000,000 - 1,000,000.

So,

1,000,000 - 3,000,000 + 3,000,000 - 1,000,000 = 0.

Oh, so a = 100 is a root.

So, we can factor (a - 100) from the cubic.

Using polynomial division or synthetic division.

Divide a³ - 300a² + 30,000a - 1,000,000 by (a - 100).

Using synthetic division:

Coefficients: 1 | -300 | 30,000 | -1,000,000

Root: 100.

Bring down 1.

Multiply by 100: 1*100 = 100. Add to next coefficient: -300 + 100 = -200.

Multiply by 100: -200 *100 = -20,000. Add to next coefficient: 30,000 + (-20,000) = 10,000.

Multiply by 100: 10,000 *100 = 1,000,000. Add to last coefficient: -1,000,000 +1,000,000 = 0.

So, the cubic factors as (a - 100)(a² - 200a + 10,000).

Now, set the quadratic factor equal to zero:

a² - 200a + 10,000 = 0.

Compute discriminant: 200² - 4*1*10,000 = 40,000 - 40,000 = 0.

So, a = [200 ± sqrt(0)] / 2 = 100.

Thus, the cubic factors as (a - 100)^2 (a - 100) ??? Wait, no.

Wait, wait. The quadratic factor was a² - 200a +10,000, which factors as (a - 100)^2 because (100)^2 = 10,000 and 2*100 = 200.

Wait, actually, (a - 100)^2 = a² - 200a + 10,000. So yes, the cubic is (a - 100)^3 = 0.

Wait, but that would mean the cubic equation only has a root at a = 100 with multiplicity 3.

But that contradicts our earlier division, where the cubic was (a - 100)(a² - 200a +10,000) = (a -100)^3.

So, the only solution is a = 100.

So, if a = b =100, then c = 300 - 2a = 300 - 200 = 100.

So, the triple is (100, 100, 100).

So, that's one solution where a = b = c = 100.

But that's just one triple. Are there others?

Wait, maybe not only when a = b. Perhaps if two variables are equal, but the third is different, but the cubic equation only gave a = 100.

Hmm, maybe I need to consider cases where all three variables are equal, but that's only (100,100,100). Or perhaps cases where two variables are equal, and the third is different, but in that case, the cubic equation didn't yield any other roots.

Alternatively, maybe I should consider cases where one of the variables is zero.

Let me suppose that c = 0. Then, a + b = 300, and the second equation becomes:

a²b + a²*0 + b²a + b²*0 + 0²a + 0²b = a²b + b²a = ab(a + b) = ab*300 = 6,000,000.

So, ab*300 = 6,000,000 → ab = 20,000.

So, with a + b = 300 and ab = 20,000, we can find a and b.

We can write quadratic equation: x² - 300x + 20,000 = 0.

Discriminant D = 90,000 - 80,000 = 10,000.

Solutions: x = [300 ± sqrt(10,000)] / 2 = [300 ± 100]/2.

So, x = (300 + 100)/2 = 200 or x = (300 - 100)/2 = 100.

So, the solutions are a = 200, b = 100 or a = 100, b = 200.

So, when c = 0, the triples are (200, 100, 0) and (100, 200, 0). But since the variables are nonnegative integers and the order matters, these are distinct triples.

But wait, in the original problem, the variables are ordered triples (a, b, c), so (200,100,0) is different from (100,200,0), etc.

So, for c=0, we have two solutions.

Similarly, if we set a=0, we can have similar solutions. Let me check.

If a = 0, then b + c = 300, and the second equation becomes:

0²b + 0²c + b²*0 + b²c + c²*0 + c² b = b² c + c² b = bc(b + c) = bc*300 = 6,000,000.

So, bc = 20,000.

So, same as before, b + c = 300, bc = 20,000.

Which gives the same quadratic: x² - 300x + 20,000 = 0, with solutions x=200 and x=100.

Thus, the triples are (0, 200, 100) and (0, 100, 200).

Similarly, if b=0, then a + c =300, and the equation becomes a²*0 + a²c + 0²a + 0²c + c²a + c²*0 = a²c + c²a = ac(a + c) = ac*300 =6,000,000.

So, ac=20,000, a +c=300.

Same as before, so triples are (200, 0, 100) and (100, 0, 200).

So, in total, for cases where one variable is zero, we have 2 (for c=0) + 2 (for a=0) + 2 (for b=0) = 6 triples.

But wait, is that correct? Because each case (a=0, b=0, c=0) gives two triples, so 3 variables * 2 =6.

But wait, actually, when c=0, we get (200,100,0) and (100,200,0). Similarly, when a=0, we get (0,200,100) and (0,100,200). And when b=0, we get (200,0,100) and (100,0,200). So, yes, 6 distinct ordered triples.

Additionally, we have the case where all three variables are equal: (100,100,100). So that's one more.

But are there other triples where none of the variables are zero, and not all equal?

Hmm, that's the question.

Let me think about whether there are other solutions where a, b, c are all positive integers.

Let me assume that none of a, b, c is zero. So, a, b, c ≥ 1.

Given that, perhaps I can try to find if there are other triples.

Wait, from the earlier equation S3 =100 S2 - 2,000,000.

And S1 =300.

We also have the relationship a³ + b³ + c³ =21,000,000 -600 S2.

But I don't know if that's helpful.

Alternatively, perhaps I can look for triples where two variables are equal but the third is different.

Wait, earlier when I assumed a = b, I only got a = 100, leading to c=100. So, perhaps if two variables are equal but not to 100, maybe I can find another solution.

Wait, let me suppose that a = b ≠ c.

Then, a + a + c =300 → c = 300 - 2a.

Then, S2 =ab + bc + ca = a² + 2a c =a² + 2a(300 - 2a) =a² + 600a -4a²= -3a² +600a.

Similarly, S3 =abc = a²c =a²(300 - 2a).

From the equation S3 =100 S2 -2,000,000.

So,

a²(300 - 2a) =100*(-3a² +600a) -2,000,000.

Compute the right-hand side:

= -300a² +60,000a -2,000,000.

Left-hand side: 300a² -2a³.

So,

300a² -2a³ = -300a² +60,000a -2,000,000.

Bring all terms to left:

300a² -2a³ +300a² -60,000a +2,000,000 = 0.

Combine like terms:

600a² -2a³ -60,000a +2,000,000 =0.

Divide by -2:

-300a² +a³ +30,000a -1,000,000=0.

Which is the same equation as before: a³ -300a² +30,000a -1,000,000=0.

Which only has a=100 as the real root, with multiplicity 3.

So, in this case, the only solution is a=100, so c=100 as well. So, that gives the triple (100,100,100). So, no other solutions where two variables are equal, except when all three are equal.

Thus, the only solutions are when either all variables are 100, or when one variable is 0 and the other two are 200 and 100 in some order.

So, that gives 1 (all 100s) + 6 (one zero, others 200 and 100) =7 triples.

Wait, but let me verify this. I have 1 triple where all are 100, and 6 triples where one is zero and the others are 200 and 100.

But wait, could there be other cases where none of a, b, c are zero, and all are distinct?

Suppose a, b, c are all positive integers, none equal to each other or zero.

Is that possible?

Let me suppose a, b, c ≥1, and a ≠ b ≠ c.

Then, S2 must be between 20,000 and 22,500, but in our earlier case, when a=100, b=100, c=100, S2=3*100*100=30,000, which is higher than 22,500.

Wait, wait, earlier I thought the maximum S2 was 22,500 when two variables are 150 and the third is 0. But if a=100, b=100, c=100, then S2=3*(100*100)=30,000, which is higher than 22,500. That can't be right.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier.

Wait, S2 is ab + bc + ca. If a, b, c are all 100, then S2=100*100 + 100*100 +100*100=30,000.

But earlier, when I thought that the maximum S2 occurs when two variables are 150 and the third is 0, which gives S2=150*150=22,500.

But wait, 30,000 is higher than 22,500, so that suggests that the maximum S2 is actually higher than 22,500.

Wait, maybe I miscalculated earlier.

Wait, let's think about what S2 can be.

If a, b, c are all 100, S2=3*100*100=30,000.

If two variables are 150 and the third is 0, S2=150*150 +150*0 +150*0=22,500.

But if all three variables are 100, S2=30,000, which is higher than 22,500.

So, in that case, the maximum S2 is 30,000.

Wait, but that contradicts my earlier assumption.

Wait, another case: if a=199, b=1, c=0.

Then S2=199*1 +1*0 +199*0=199.

If a=190, b=10, c=0, S2=190*10=1900.

If a=150, b=150, c=0, S2=150*150=22,500.

If a=100, b=100, c=100, S2=3*(100*100)=30,000.

So, yes, S2 can range up to 30,000.

Wait, but in our problem, from S3 =100 S2 -2,000,000.

Since S3 must be nonnegative, 100 S2 -2,000,000 ≥0 → S2 ≥20,000.

So, S2 is in [20,000, 30,000].

Hmm, that's a much larger range.

So, in our earlier assumption, I thought S2 maximum was 22,500, but actually, it's 30,000.

So, S2 can range from 20,000 up to 30,000.

So, S3 is from 0 up to 100*30,000 -2,000,000= 3,000,000 -2,000,000=1,000,000.

Wait, but S3 must also be an integer, as a, b, c are integers.

So, for each S2 in 20,000 to 30,000, S3 is determined.

But how can I find all possible triples (a,b,c) that satisfy the equations?

It's getting a bit complicated.

Wait, perhaps I can use the fact that a, b, c are integers, so the cubic equation must have integer roots.

Earlier, when I set a = b, the only solution was a = b = c = 100. So, that's one solution.

When one of the variables is zero, we get six more solutions.

But what about other possibilities where none of the variables are zero and all are distinct?

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps I can consider that the equation S3 =100 S2 -2,000,000 can be rewritten as S3 =100 S2 -2*10^6.

But S3 is abc, and S2 is ab + bc + ca.

So, perhaps in cases where a, b, c are all non-zero and distinct, I can find solutions.

But this might be time-consuming.

Wait, perhaps I can think of the equation 300 S2 -3 S3=6,000,000 as:

S2 - (1/100) S3 = 20,000.

But not sure.

Alternatively, let me consider that S3 =100 S2 -2,000,000.

So, abc=100(ab + bc + ca) -2,000,000.

Hmm, let me rearrange:

abc -100ab -100 bc -100 ca = -2,000,000.

Factor:

ab(c -100) -100 c (a + b) = -2,000,000.

But since a + b + c =300, a + b =300 -c.

So,

ab(c -100) -100 c (300 -c) = -2,000,000.

Hmm, that might not be helpful.

Alternatively, let me write abc =100(ab + bc + ca) -2,000,000.

Divide both sides by abc (assuming a, b, c ≠0):

1 =100(1/c + 1/a + 1/b) -2,000,000/(abc).

But this seems messy.

Wait, maybe think in terms of reciprocals.

Alternatively, let me think about the equation:

abc =100(ab + bc + ca) -2,000,000.

Let me factor 100:

abc =100(ab + bc + ca) -2,000,000.

Divide both sides by 100:

(abc)/100 = ab + bc + ca -20,000.

Hmm, not sure.

Wait, let me write it as:

abc -100ab -100 bc -100 ca = -2,000,000.

Factor:

ab(c -100) -100 c (a + b) = -2,000,000.

Again, since a + b =300 -c,

ab(c -100) -100 c (300 -c) = -2,000,000.

Hmm, maybe express ab in terms of S2 and c.

Since ab = S2 - c(a + b) = S2 -c(300 -c).

So, ab = S2 -300 c + c².

Substituting into the equation:

(S2 -300 c + c²)(c -100) -100 c (300 -c) = -2,000,000.

But this seems to get even more complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps I can set t = c.

Then, a + b =300 -t.

And S2 =ab + bc + ca =ab +c(a + b) =ab +c(300 -c).

So, ab = S2 -c(300 -c).

Then, substituting back into the equation:

(S2 -c(300 -c)) * (c -100) -100c(300 -c) = -2,000,000.

But since S3 = abc = c(ab) = c(S2 -c(300 -c)).

Hmm, perhaps I'm going in circles.

Alternatively, maybe try to represent the equation differently.

Wait, let me think about the original equation: a + b + c =300, and 300 S2 -3 S3=6,000,000.

We can write this as 100 S2 - S3 = 2,000,000.

Also, the identity a³ + b³ + c³ -3abc = (a + b + c)(a² + b² + c² -ab - bc -ca).

Which is another symmetric identity.

So, a³ + b³ + c³ -3abc = S1 ( (a² + b² + c²) - S2 ).

We know S1=300, so:

a³ + b³ + c³ -3abc =300 ( (a² + b² + c²) - S2 ).

But from earlier, a³ + b³ + c³ =21,000,000 -600 S2.

So, substituting:

(21,000,000 -600 S2) - 3 S3 =300 ( (90,000 - 2 S2) - S2 ).

Simplify the right-hand side:

300(90,000 -3 S2 )= 27,000,000 -900 S2.

So, left side:

21,000,000 -600 S2 -3 S3 =27,000,000 -900 S2.

Bring all terms to left:

21,000,000 -600 S2 -3 S3 -27,000,000 +900 S2 =0.

Simplify:

-6,000,000 +300 S2 -3 S3=0.

Divide by 3:

-2,000,000 +100 S2 - S3=0.

Which is the same as 100 S2 - S3=2,000,000. So, that's consistent with our earlier equation. So, again, no new information.

Hmm, seems like I'm stuck here.

Wait, another idea: Since a, b, c are positive integers, perhaps I can express them as a =100 + x, b=100 + y, c=100 +z, such that x + y + z =0.

Wait, but that might not necessarily help, unless x, y, z are constrained.

But perhaps, thinking about the deviations from 100.

Alternatively, maybe think of a, b as 100 + k and 100 + m, and c as 100 -k -m.

But not sure.

Alternatively, let me think about the original equation:

300 S2 -3 S3=6,000,000.

Divide both sides by 3:

100 S2 - S3=2,000,000.

So, S3=100 S2 -2,000,000.

Since S3=abc, and S2=ab + bc + ca.

So, abc=100(ab + bc + ca) -2,000,000.

Hmm, so, perhaps I can write:

abc -100ab -100 bc -100 ca = -2,000,000.

Factor:

ab(c -100) -100 c (a + b) = -2,000,000.

But a + b=300 -c, so:

ab(c -100) -100 c (300 -c) = -2,000,000.

This seems similar to earlier steps.

So, ab(c -100) =100 c (300 -c) -2,000,000.

But ab= S2 - c (a + b) = S2 -c (300 -c).

So,

(S2 - c (300 -c))(c -100) =100 c (300 -c) -2,000,000.

But S2 is also related to abc.

Wait, maybe substituting S3 =100 S2 -2,000,000 into ab.

Wait, S3 =abc =100 S2 -2,000,000.

So, ab= (100 S2 -2,000,000)/c.

But S2=ab + bc + ca.

So,

S2 = (100 S2 -2,000,000)/c + bc + ca.

Multiply all terms by c:

c S2 =100 S2 -2,000,000 + bc² + c² a.

Hmm, not helpful.

Alternatively, perhaps this approach is not leading anywhere.

Wait, perhaps try specific values for c and see if we can find integer solutions for a and b.

Let me suppose that c=100.

Then, a + b=200.

S2=ab +100a +100b =ab +100(a +b)=ab +100*200=ab +20,000.

S3=ab*100.

From S3=100 S2 -2,000,000:

ab*100=100(ab +20,000) -2,000,000.

Simplify:

100ab=100ab +2,000,000 -2,000,000.

So, 100ab=100ab +0.

Which is an identity. So, any a, b such that a + b=200 will satisfy the equation when c=100.

So, the triples are (a, 200 -a, 100) where a is from 0 to 200.

But wait, in this case, c=100, which is non-zero. So, in this scenario, all triples where c=100, a + b=200.

So, how many such triples are there?

Since a can be 0,1,2,...,200, that's 201 possibilities. But wait, but in our earlier cases, when one variable is zero, we have specific solutions.

Wait, but in this case, if c=100, and a=0, then b=200. So, the triple is (0,200,100), which we already considered earlier.

Similarly, if a=100, then b=100, which is the all-100s triple.

So, for c=100, we have 201 possible triples, but many of them are already counted in the cases where one variable is zero or all variables are 100.

Wait, but no, because when c=100, and a=200, b=0, which is the triple (200,0,100), which is already counted.

Similarly, a=100, b=100, c=100 is another case.

So, in this case, when c=100, we get 201 triples, but they include the cases where another variable is zero or all are 100.

But wait, in our earlier approach, we found 7 triples: 1 where all are 100, and 6 where one is zero and the others are 200 and 100.

But according to this, for c=100, there are 201 possible triples, which is way more than 7.

So, this seems conflicting.

But wait, no. Because when c=100, the second equation is automatically satisfied for any a and b such that a + b=200.

So, for any a and b where a + b=200, the triple (a, b, 100) satisfies both equations.

So, that's a lot more solutions than I initially thought.

Wait, but earlier when we considered cases where one variable is zero, we found 6 solutions, but in this case, when c=100, we have 201 solutions, which are all triples where c=100 and a + b=200.

So, that suggests that the total number of solutions is way more than 7.

Wait, that's confusing. So, perhaps my earlier approach was incorrect.

Wait, let's go back.

We have the equation 300 S2 -3 S3=6,000,000, which simplifies to S3=100 S2 -2,000,000.

So, for any triple (a, b, c), if S3=100 S2 -2,000,000, then it satisfies the second equation.

So, perhaps when c=100, as we saw, S3=ab*100, and S2=ab +100a +100b.

So, substituting into S3=100 S2 -2,000,000:

ab*100=100(ab +100a +100b) -2,000,000.

Simplify:

100ab=100ab +10,000a +10,000b -2,000,000.

Subtract 100ab:

0 =10,000a +10,000b -2,000,000.

Divide by 10,000:

0 =a + b -200.

Which gives a + b=200.

Which is consistent with c=100, since a +b +c=300.

So, all triples where c=100 and a + b=200 satisfy the second equation.

So, that gives 201 triples (since a can be 0 to 200).

Similarly, if I set a=100, then b + c=200, and similar reasoning would apply.

Wait, let me test this.

Set a=100, then b +c=200.

Compute S2=ab + bc + ca=100b + bc +100c=100(b +c) + bc=100*200 + bc=20,000 + bc.

S3=abc=100 bc.

From S3=100 S2 -2,000,000:

100 bc=100*(20,000 + bc) -2,000,000.

Simplify:

100 bc=2,000,000 +100 bc -2,000,000.

Which reduces to 100 bc=100 bc.

So, again, identity.

Thus, any triple where a=100, b +c=200 satisfies the second equation.

So, that's another 201 triples.

Similarly, if b=100, then a +c=200, and the same reasoning applies, giving another 201 triples.

So, in total, setting a=100, b=100, or c=100 each gives 201 triples.

But wait, but when a=100, b=100, c=100 is counted in all three cases.

Also, when a=100 and c=100, then b=100, which is the same as the all-100s case.

So, the total number of distinct triples where at least one variable is 100 is 3*201 -3*1 +1= ?

Wait, no, the inclusion-exclusion is a bit tricky.

Wait, each of the three cases (a=100, b=100, c=100) gives 201 triples, but they have overlaps.

Specifically, when two variables are 100, the third is 100 as well.

So, the triple (100,100,100) is counted three times, once in each case.

So, the total number is 3*201 -3*1 +1=603 -3 +1=601? Wait, no, inclusion-exclusion is more like |A ∪ B ∪ C|= |A| + |B| + |C| - |A∩B| - |A∩C| - |B∩C| + |A∩B∩C|.

So, |A|=|B|=|C|=201.

|A∩B| is the number of triples where a=100 and b=100, which is c can be 100, so only 1 triple.

Similarly, |A∩C|=1 and |B∩C|=1.

|A∩B∩C|=1.

So, total number is 3*201 -3*1 +1=603 -3 +1=601.

Wait, but 3*201=603, minus 3*1=3 (the intersections of two sets), plus 1 (the intersection of all three sets).

So, 603 -3 +1=601.

But wait, this counts all triples where a=100 or b=100 or c=100.

But in our problem, we also have the cases where one variable is zero, which are not included in the above.

Earlier, we found 6 such triples: (200,100,0) and permutations.

So, if I have 601 triples where at least one variable is 100, and 6 triples where one variable is zero, but wait, are these disjoint sets?

Because in the 601, are there any triples where a variable is zero?

When a=100, b +c=200. If c=0, then b=200. So, the triple (100,200,0) is in the set where a=100.

Similarly, (100,0,200) is also in a=100.

Similarly, when c=100, a +b=200. So, (0,200,100) and (200,0,100) are in c=100.

When b=100, a +c=200. So, (200,100,0) and (0,100,200) are in b=100.

So, the 6 triples where one variable is zero are all included in the 601 triples where at least one variable is 100.

Therefore, the total number of triples is 601.

But wait, wait. Let me think again.

When a=100, b +c=200. So, c can be 0, leading to b=200. So, (100,200,0) is included.

Similarly, when c=100, a can be 0, leading to b=200. So, (0,200,100) is included.

Similarly, when b=100, a can be 0, leading to c=200. So, (0,100,200) is included.

So, yes, the 6 triples with one zero are already included in the 601.

So, the total number of solutions is 601.

But wait, this seems high.

Wait, let me think: the number of triples where at least one variable is 100 is 601.

But wait, when a=100, b +c=200, so there are 201 such triples.

Similarly for b=100 and c=100.

But the overlaps occur when two variables are 100, which is only the triple (100,100,100).

Wait, no, wait: when a=100 and b=100, then c=100, so that's only one triple.

Similarly for a=100 and c=100, b=100, and b=100 and c=100, a=100.

So, each pair intersection gives one triple.

So, using inclusion-exclusion:

Total = |a=100| + |b=100| + |c=100| - |a=100 ∧ b=100| - |a=100 ∧ c=100| - |b=100 ∧ c=100| + |a=100 ∧ b=100 ∧ c=100|.

Which is 201 +201 +201 -1 -1 -1 +1= 603 -3 +1=601.

So, 601 is correct.

But wait, in our earlier analysis, when we set a=100, b +c=200, c can be 0, which gives (100,200,0), which is a valid triple.

Similarly, when c=100, a can be 0, giving (0,200,100).

And when b=100, a can be 0, giving (0,100,200).

So, these 6 triples are included in the 601.

So, the total number of triples is 601.

But wait, let me check with another approach.

Another way to think about this: for each variable being 100, we have 201 triples, but overlapping when two variables are 100, which only occurs when all three are 100.

So, the total number is 3*201 -3*1 +1=603 -3 +1=601.

So, that seems to be the case.

Therefore, the answer should be 601.

But let me double-check.

Wait, the problem says "nonnegative integers". So, including zero.

So, in all the cases where a variable is 100, whether others are positive or zero, it's allowed.

So, the inclusion-exclusion count of 601 is correct.

Thus, the number of triples is 601.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To solve the problem, we analyze the given equations and identify the valid triples \((a, b, c)\) that satisfy both \(a + b + c = 300\) and \(a^2b + a^2c + b^2a + b^2c + c^2a + c^2b = 6,000,000\). 

First, we express the second equation in terms of symmetric sums:
\[
a^2b + a^2c + b^2a + b^2c + c^2a + c^2b = 300(ab + bc + ca) - 3abc = 6,000,000.
\]
This simplifies to:
\[
100(ab + bc + ca) - abc = 2,000,000.
\]
Let \(S_2 = ab + bc + ca\) and \(S_3 = abc\). Then:
\[
100S_2 - S_3 = 2,000,000 \quad \Rightarrow \quad S_3 = 100S_2 - 2,000,000.
\]

We consider cases where one of the variables is 100. For example, if \(a = 100\), then \(b + c = 200\). Substituting into the equation, we find that any pair \((b, c)\) such that \(b + c = 200\) satisfies the condition. This gives 201 solutions for \(a = 100\). Similarly, setting \(b = 100\) or \(c = 100\) each yields 201 solutions. 

Using the principle of inclusion-exclusion, we account for overlaps where two variables are 100, which only occurs when all three variables are 100. Thus, the total number of valid triples is:
\[
3 \times 201 - 3 \times 1 + 1 = 601.
\]
