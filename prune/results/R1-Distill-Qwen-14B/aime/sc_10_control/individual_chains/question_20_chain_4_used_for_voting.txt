Okay, so I've got this problem here about placing chips on a 5x5 grid. There are 25 white chips and 25 black chips, all indistinguishable. The goal is to find the number of ways to place some of these chips in the grid under certain conditions.

Let me first parse the problem statement carefully.

1. Each cell can contain at most one chip. So no cell is left with two chips; it's either occupied by a white or black chip or is empty.

2. All chips in the same row must be the same color. That means, for any given row, if there's a white chip in that row, all chips in that row must be white, and similarly for black. So a row can't have both white and black chips. Wait, but can a row be empty? The problem doesn't say anything about rows or columns needing to have at least one chip. So a row could be entirely empty, or entirely white, or entirely black. Same for columns.

3. The same logic applies to columns as well. All chips in the same column must be the same color. So if there's a white chip in a column, all chips in that column must be white, and if a column has any black chip, all must be black. But again, a column could be empty.

4. The last condition is that any additional chip placed on the grid would violate one or more of the previous two conditions. So the placement is maximal in the sense that you can't add another chip without violating the same-row or same-column color condition. So, in other words, the placement is such that every empty cell is such that if you try to place a chip there, it would either conflict with the row's existing color or the column's existing color.

Hmm. So let me think about how this works.

First, let's consider the rows. Each row can be either all white, all black, or empty. Similarly, each column can be all white, all black, or empty.

But wait, if a row is non-empty, it has to be all one color. Same for columns. So the grid is constrained in such a way that for each row and column, their color assignments are uniform if they're non-empty.

Now, the last condition says that the placement is maximal. That means that for every empty cell, placing a chip of either color would violate the row or column condition. So, for each empty cell, either its row is non-empty (and thus already has a color assigned), or its column is non-empty (and thus already has a color assigned), or both. Because if a cell is empty and both its row and column are empty, then placing a chip there would not violate any condition—since the row and column are both empty, you could place a chip of either color without violating the same-row or same-column condition. But the problem states that the placement must be such that adding any chip would violate the conditions, so such a cell cannot exist. Therefore, every empty cell must be in a row that already has a color (so the row is non-empty) or a column that already has a color (so the column is non-empty). So, the placement must cover all rows and columns such that every empty cell is in a row that has at least one chip or a column that has at least one chip.

Wait, but that might be a bit more precise. Let me think again.

Suppose I have an empty cell at (i,j). Then, if I place a white or black chip there, it should violate the row or column condition. So, placing a chip of color C there would require that either the row i already has a different color, or the column j already has a different color.

So, for cell (i,j) to be empty, it must be that row i is non-empty, or column j is non-empty, or both. Because if both row i and column j are empty, then placing a chip there would not violate any condition, which violates the maximal condition.

Therefore, every empty cell must be in a row that's non-empty or a column that's non-empty. Which implies that the union of all non-empty rows and non-empty columns must cover all empty cells.

Wait, but that's a bit abstract. Let me think in terms of the grid.

Each cell is either occupied (by a chip) or empty. For each empty cell (i,j), either row i is non-empty or column j is non-empty (or both). So, the set of empty cells is covered by the union of the non-empty rows and non-empty columns.

This is starting to sound like a bipartite graph problem, but maybe that's complicating things.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to model the rows and columns as sets. Let me denote R as the set of non-empty rows, and C as the set of non-empty columns. Then, any cell (i,j) where i is not in R and j is not in C must be empty, because if i is not in R and j is not in C, then row i and column j are both empty, which would allow a chip to be placed there without violating any condition. But the maximal condition forbids that, so such cells can't exist. Therefore, all cells (i,j) where i is not in R and j is not in C must be empty. Wait, but that's not necessarily the case because the cell (i,j) could be empty even if either i is in R or j is in C. Hmm.

Wait, no. The condition is that every empty cell must be in a row that's non-empty or a column that's non-empty. So, the complement of the union of R and C would be the set of cells where both the row and column are empty. But those cells cannot exist because you can't place a chip there without violating the maximal condition. Therefore, the union of R and C must cover all empty cells. But wait, in reality, R and C are sets of rows and columns that are non-empty. So, the cells not in R (rows) or C (columns) are the empty cells. Wait, I'm getting a bit tangled here.

Alternatively, perhaps I can model the problem as follows:

Each non-empty row has a color (white or black), and each non-empty column has a color (white or black). The placement of chips is such that in each non-empty row, all chips are the same color, same for columns.

But wait, there's a conflict here. If a row is non-empty, it has a color (say, white). If a column is non-empty, it has a color (say, black). But if a cell is at the intersection of a white row and a black column, then what? Because placing a chip there would have to satisfy both the row's color and the column's color. But they might be conflicting.

Wait a minute, that's a crucial point. If row i is white, then all non-empty cells in row i must be white. Similarly, if column j is black, all non-empty cells in column j must be black. So, for a cell (i,j) to be non-empty, the row i's color and column j's color must agree. Otherwise, you can't have a chip there because the row says white and the column says black, which is impossible. So, in other words, the only cells that can be non-empty are those where the row's color and the column's color are the same.

Ah, so that gives us more structure. So, for row i, if it's non-empty, it's color is either white or black. Similarly for column j. But if a cell (i,j) is non-empty, then the color of row i and column j must be the same. So, the non-empty cells lie at the intersection of rows and columns of the same color.

So, perhaps this can be modeled as a bipartition of the rows and columns into white and black, such that the only cells that can be occupied are those where the row and column have the same color.

Wait, that's an interesting approach. Let me think.

Let me denote:

- Let R_w be the set of rows colored white.
- Let R_b be the set of rows colored black.
- Similarly, C_w be the set of columns colored white.
- C_b be the set of columns colored black.

Each row is either in R_w or R_b or is empty. Similarly for columns.

But wait, earlier I thought that rows and columns can be non-empty or empty. But now, perhaps it's better to model each row as being either white, black, or empty. Similarly for columns. But considering the condition that a cell (i,j) can be non-empty only if row i and column j have the same color.

So, the non-empty cells must lie in the intersections where row and column colors agree.

Wait, but for a row to be non-empty, it must have some cells occupied, but those cells must also lie in columns that are either the same color or empty. Wait, no. If row i is non-empty, then all cells in row i must be the same color. But for a cell (i,j) to be non-empty, column j must have the same color as row i.

So, if row i is white, then all non-empty cells in row i must lie in columns that are white. Similarly, if row i is black, then all non-empty cells in row i must lie in columns that are black. The same applies for columns: if column j is white, then all non-empty cells in column j must lie in rows that are white, and same for black.

This structure implies that the grid is divided into four blocks:

1. Rows colored white and columns colored white: cells (i,j) where i ∈ R_w and j ∈ C_w.
2. Rows colored white and columns colored black: cells (i,j) where i ∈ R_w and j ∈ C_b.
3. Rows colored black and columns colored white: cells (i,j) where i ∈ R_b and j ∈ C_w.
4. Rows colored black and columns colored black: cells (i,j) where i ∈ R_b and j ∈ C_b.

Now, in each of these four blocks, the cells can be non-empty only if their row and column have the same color. But wait, in block 2, row i is white and column j is black, so the cell (i,j) must be empty because you can't have a chip there (as row i is white, column j is black, which are different). Similarly, block 3 must be empty. Only blocks 1 and 4 can have non-empty cells.

Wait, that's not correct. Because in block 1, row i is white and column j is white, so the cell can be non-empty. Similarly, in block 4, row i is black and column j is black, so cell can be non-empty. But in blocks 2 and 3, the row and column colors conflict, so those cells must be empty.

So, the grid is divided such that non-empty cells can only be in blocks 1 and 4, while blocks 2 and 3 are entirely empty.

Wait, but that seems too restrictive. Let me check with an example. Suppose row 1 is white, column 1 is white. Then cell (1,1) can be non-empty, say white. Now, if row 2 is black and column 2 is black, then cell (2,2) can be black. But what about cell (1,2)? Since row 1 is white and column 2 is black, cell (1,2) can't be non-empty. Similarly, cell (2,1) can't be non-empty because row 2 is black and column 1 is white. So, in this scenario, the non-empty cells are only along the diagonal where rows and columns have the same color.

Wait, that's a possible scenario, but perhaps more generally, the non-empty cells can be anywhere as long as their row and column have the same color. So, for instance, if R_w includes multiple rows and C_w includes multiple columns, then the intersection of these rows and columns can be filled with white chips. Similarly for R_b and C_b.

But wait, there's a catch here. Because if R_w includes row i and C_w includes column j, then cell (i,j) can be non-empty, but how does that interact with the rest of the grid?

Moreover, each row in R_w must have all its non-empty cells in columns that are in C_w. Similarly, each column in C_w must have all its non-empty cells in rows that are in R_w. Wait, no, that's not necessarily the case. Because a row in R_w can have non-empty cells in any column that's in C_w. Similarly, a column in C_w can have non-empty cells in any row that's in R_w.

Wait, perhaps it's better to model this as a bipartite graph where rows and columns are nodes, and edges represent allowed cells (i,j) where row i and column j have the same color. Then, the placement of chips is a subset of these edges, with certain constraints.

But perhaps this is getting too abstract. Maybe I should think of it in terms of variables.

Let me denote:

- Let R_w be the set of rows colored white. So, |R_w| = r_w.
- Let R_b be the set of rows colored black. |R_b| = r_b.
- Similarly, C_w is the set of columns colored white. |C_w| = c_w.
- C_b is the set of columns colored black. |C_b| = c_b.

Since there are 5 rows, r_w + r_b + r_empty = 5, where r_empty is the number of empty rows. Similarly for columns: c_w + c_b + c_empty = 5.

But wait, earlier, I thought that empty rows and columns can't have any chips, but also, for the maximal condition, every empty cell must be in a row that's non-empty or a column that's non-empty.

Wait, perhaps it's better to model it as rows and columns can be either white, black, or empty, but with the constraints that any cell not in R_w ∪ R_b (i.e., in empty rows) or C_w ∪ C_b (empty columns) must be empty. But I'm not entirely sure.

Wait, maybe another approach. Since any empty cell (i,j) must be in a row that is non-empty (so row i has at least one chip) or a column that is non-empty (so column j has at least one chip), or both. Therefore, the set of empty cells is exactly the set of cells where both row i is empty and column j is empty. Because if either row i or column j is non-empty, then (i,j) could be empty but not violating the maximal condition. Wait, no, that's not quite right. Because if row i is non-empty, then cell (i,j) can be empty, but that doesn't necessarily violate the maximal condition because you could possibly add a chip there without conflicting with row i's color. Wait, no, because if row i is non-empty, all chips in that row are the same color. So, if I place a chip in (i,j), it must be the same color as the rest of row i. But if column j is empty, then placing a white or black chip there would require that the column j's color matches. Wait, perhaps it's getting too confusing.

Alternatively, perhaps the key is to model the grid as a bipartition where rows are either white, black, or empty, and similarly for columns, with the constraint that any cell (i,j) that's non-empty must have row i and column j of the same color. Then, the maximal condition implies that for every empty cell (i,j), either row i is non-empty or column j is non-empty. So, the empty cells are those that are not in any non-empty row or column. Wait, that might not make sense. Let me think again.

Wait, if a cell is empty, then either row i is non-empty or column j is non-empty. So, the empty cells are those where row i is empty AND column j is empty. Because if row i is non-empty, then cell (i,j) could be empty but not in the sense that both row and column are empty. Wait, no. Let me think about it.

Suppose row i is non-empty (say, white). Then, cell (i,j) can be empty if column j is empty, right? Because placing a white chip in (i,j) would require that column j is all white. But if column j is empty, then placing a white chip there would make column j non-empty as white. But in the maximal condition, you can't add any chip without violating the conditions. So, if row i is non-empty (white), and column j is empty, then cell (i,j) must be empty because placing a white chip there would require column j to become white, but that's allowed. Wait, but that would violate the maximal condition because you can add a chip there without violating any condition. Therefore, if row i is non-empty, then all cells in row i must be non-empty? No, that can't be, because the problem allows some cells to be empty.

Wait, perhaps the maximal condition requires that every empty cell is such that adding a chip there would make the row or column have conflicting colors. So, if row i is non-empty, say white, and column j is empty, then placing a white chip in (i,j) would mean column j is now non-empty as white, which is allowed. Therefore, that would not violate any condition, which contradicts the maximal condition. Therefore, such a cell (i,j) cannot be empty. Therefore, if row i is non-empty, then all cells in row i must be non-empty. Similarly, if column j is non-empty, all cells in column j must be non-empty.

Wait, that seems to make sense. Because if row i is non-empty, any empty cell in row i would allow adding a chip without conflict, which violates the maximal condition. Therefore, every non-empty row must have all its cells filled with chips of the same color. Similarly, every non-empty column must have all its cells filled with chips of the same color.

But wait, that's a strong condition. So, for a row to be non-empty, it must be entirely filled with chips of the same color. Similarly, for a column to be non-empty, it must be entirely filled with chips of the same color.

Wait, but in that case, how can both a row and a column be non-empty? Because if row i is non-empty (say, white), and column j is non-empty (say, black), then cell (i,j) must be both white (because row i is white) and black (because column j is black), which is impossible. Therefore, the only way this can happen is if row i and column j have the same color.

Wait, so that suggests that the non-empty rows and non-empty columns must all have the same color. Because if you have a non-empty row of white, then any non-empty column must also be white. Otherwise, their intersection would require a cell to be both white and black, which is impossible. Therefore, all non-empty rows and columns must have the same color.

This is a critical point. So, all non-empty rows and columns must have the same color. Let me formalize this.

Suppose that all non-empty rows are white and all non-empty columns are white. Then, any cell (i,j) where row i and column j are non-empty must be white. Similarly, if all non-empty rows are black and all non-empty columns are black, then their intersections are black.

But wait, what if some rows are white and others are black? No, that can't happen because then a column that is non-empty would have to agree with all the rows it intersects. But if a column is non-empty, say white, and if there's a non-empty row of black, then their intersection would require a cell to be white and black, which is impossible. Therefore, all non-empty rows must be the same color, and all non-empty columns must be the same color, and the non-empty rows and columns must all be of the same color.

So, the entire grid's non-empty rows and columns must be of a single color, either all white or all black.

Wait, that's a significant simplification. So, the grid can be partitioned into non-empty rows and columns of a single color (either white or black), and the rest are empty.

Wait, but that can't be the case because the problem allows for some rows or columns to be empty. So, let me think again.

Wait, perhaps the non-empty rows and non-empty columns are all of the same color. So, either:

1. All non-empty rows are white, all non-empty columns are white.

OR

2. All non-empty rows are black, all non-empty columns are black.

So, the non-empty rows and columns are monochromatic, but the entire set can be either white or black.

Therefore, the grid is divided into four regions:

- Rows and columns that are non-empty (all same color, say, white): their intersection cells are filled with white chips.

- Rows that are non-empty (white) and columns that are empty: these cells must be empty.

- Rows that are empty and columns that are non-empty (white): these cells must be empty.

- Rows and columns that are empty: these cells can be empty, but wait, can they be non-empty?

Wait, no. Because if a row is empty, then all cells in that row are empty. Similarly, if a column is empty, all cells in that column are empty.

Wait, but earlier I thought that the maximal condition requires that every empty cell is in a non-empty row or column. But if a row is empty, then all cells in that row are empty, and those cells are in empty rows. Similarly for columns.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let me re-examine.

If a row is non-empty, it must be filled entirely with chips of the same color. Similarly for columns.

But if a row is non-empty, then all cells in that row must be non-empty? No, that's not necessarily the case. Wait, but earlier reasoning suggested that if a row is non-empty, then all its cells must be non-empty because otherwise, you could add a chip to an empty cell in that row without violating the row's color condition. But that would violate the maximal condition.

Wait, let's think with an example. Suppose row i is non-empty and white. Then, if there's an empty cell in row i, say cell (i,j), then placing a white chip there would not violate the row's condition. However, it would require that column j is now all white. But if column j was previously empty, then placing a white chip there would make column j non-empty as white, which is allowed. But this would allow adding a chip, which violates the maximal condition. Therefore, to satisfy the maximal condition, any empty cell in a non-empty row must have its column already non-empty. Similarly, any empty cell in a non-empty column must have its row already non-empty.

Wait, but that's a bit more precise. So, for a cell (i,j) to be empty, either row i is empty or column j is empty. Because if row i is non-empty, then placing a chip in (i,j) would require that column j becomes non-empty (if it wasn't already) of the same color as row i. But then, that would allow adding a chip without violating any condition, which would violate the maximal condition. Therefore, for the maximal condition to hold, every empty cell (i,j) must have either row i or column j already non-empty. Wait, no. Because if row i is non-empty and column j is empty, then placing a chip in (i,j) would require column j to become non-empty as the same color as row i. But according to the problem statement, all chips in the same column must be the same color. So, if you place a chip in (i,j), then column j must be all the same color as row i. But if column j was previously empty, then placing a white (or black) chip there would make it non-empty. So, in that case, you could place a chip, which violates the maximal condition. Therefore, such a cell (i,j) cannot be empty. Therefore, every empty cell must be in an empty row and an empty column. Wait, that's a key insight.

So, the maximal condition implies that the empty cells are precisely those cells (i,j) where both row i and column j are empty. Because if row i is non-empty, then cell (i,j) cannot be empty, as adding a chip there wouldn't violate any condition, which violates the maximal condition. Similarly, if column j is non-empty, cell (i,j) cannot be empty. Therefore, the only cells that can be empty are those where both their row and column are empty.

Therefore, the placement is such that the non-empty rows and columns form a rectangle in the grid, and all cells outside this rectangle are empty. Moreover, the non-empty rows and columns must all be of the same color.

Wait, that makes sense. So, the non-empty rows and columns are all of the same color, say white, and their intersection is filled with white chips. The rest of the grid (rows and columns that are empty) are empty.

Alternatively, the non-empty rows and columns could be all black, and their intersection is filled with black chips.

So, the problem reduces to choosing a subset of rows and a subset of columns, all of which are either white or black, such that their intersection is filled with chips of the same color, and the rest of the grid is empty. Moreover, the number of white and black chips must not exceed 25 each.

Wait, but the problem says we have 25 white and 25 black chips, but the placement can use some of them. So, the total number of chips placed can be anywhere from 0 to 50, but subject to the conditions.

Wait, but in our current model, the entire non-empty region is either white or black. So, the number of white chips would be the number of non-empty rows multiplied by the number of non-empty columns, if all non-empty rows and columns are white. Similarly, if all non-empty rows and columns are black, then the number of black chips is rows × columns.

Wait, but the problem allows any number of white and black chips, as long as we don't exceed 25 each. So, perhaps we need to consider both possibilities: one where the non-empty rows and columns are white, and another where they're black. But wait, but the non-empty rows and columns must all be the same color, as we determined earlier.

Therefore, the problem can be split into two cases:

1. All non-empty rows and columns are white. Let the number of non-empty rows be r_w and the number of non-empty columns be c_w. Then, the number of white chips is r_w × c_w. The number of black chips is zero in this case.

2. All non-empty rows and columns are black. Similarly, number of non-empty rows r_b and columns c_b. Number of black chips is r_b × c_b. Number of white chips is zero.

But wait, the problem allows for some white and some black chips as long as they satisfy the conditions. So, perhaps I was wrong earlier. Maybe the non-empty rows and columns can be either all white or all black, but not a mix. Because mixing would cause conflicts in the cells where rows and columns intersect.

Wait, let me think again. Suppose we have some non-empty rows as white and some as black. Then, for a column to be non-empty, it would have to agree with all the rows it intersects. But if a column is non-empty as white, then any row it intersects must also be white. Similarly, if a column is non-empty as black, any row it intersects must be black. Therefore, the non-empty rows and columns must all agree on a single color. So, either all are white or all are black.

Therefore, the grid can have non-empty rows and columns of a single color, either white or black, but not both. So, the problem splits into two cases:

Case 1: All non-empty rows and columns are white.

Case 2: All non-empty rows and columns are black.

In each case, the number of white or black chips placed is r × c, where r is the number of non-empty rows and c is the number of non-empty columns.

But we have to ensure that the number of chips doesn't exceed 25 for each color. So, for case 1, r × c ≤ 25, because all chips are white. Similarly, for case 2, r × c ≤ 25.

Wait, but in case 1, the number of white chips is r × c, and black chips are zero. Similarly, in case 2, black chips are r × c, and white chips are zero.

But the problem allows us to have some white and some black chips, as long as each satisfies their own conditions. So, perhaps I'm missing something here.

Wait, no. Because if we have non-empty rows and columns of white, and also non-empty rows and columns of black, then their intersection would require cells to be both white and black, which is impossible. Therefore, the entire non-empty part of the grid must be either all white or all black.

Wait, but perhaps there's another way. Maybe the grid can be divided into two separate blocks: one where non-empty rows and columns are white, and another where non-empty rows and columns are black. But these two blocks must not intersect, meaning their rows and columns are completely separate. So, the white block uses some rows and some columns, and the black block uses entirely different rows and columns. But wait, that might not be possible because each row can be used for only one color. Let me think.

Suppose we have a set of rows R_w and columns C_w for white chips, and a set of rows R_b and columns C_b for black chips. Then, for R_w and C_w, their intersection would be white chips, and for R_b and C_b, their intersection would be black chips. But R_w and R_b must be disjoint, and C_w and C_b must be disjoint. Because if a row is in both R_w and R_b, then it would have to be both white and black, which is impossible.

Therefore, the rows and columns used for white and black chips must be entirely separate. So, for example, R_w and R_b are disjoint, and similarly for columns.

In that case, the total number of white chips is |R_w| × |C_w|, and the total number of black chips is |R_b| × |C_b|. But we must ensure that |R_w| + |R_b| ≤5 and |C_w| + |C_b| ≤5.

Moreover, the white and black regions are separate, so their intersections don't interfere.

Wait, but then each cell in R_w × C_w is white, and each cell in R_b × C_b is black. The rest of the cells are empty. Now, this setup would satisfy the conditions because:

- Each row in R_w has all white chips, and each row in R_b has all black chips.

- Each column in C_w has all white chips, and each column in C_b has all black chips.

- The empty cells are those not in R_w ∪ R_b or C_w ∪ C_b, but actually, the empty cells are those not in (R_w × C_w) ∪ (R_b × C_b). But wait, the empty cells must satisfy that every empty cell is in a non-empty row or non-empty column. So, let's see. For a cell (i,j) not in R_w × C_w or R_b × C_b, it could be in R_w but C_b, or R_b but C_w, or neither.

But in the setup where R_w and R_b are disjoint, and C_w and C_b are disjoint, then:

- If (i,j) is in R_w and C_b, then row i is non-empty (white) and column j is non-empty (black). But since row i is white and column j is black, cell (i,j) must be empty. But according to the maximal condition, this cell must be such that adding a chip would violate the conditions. Since row i is white, adding a white chip would require column j to become white, which conflicts with column j being black. Similarly, adding a black chip would conflict with row i being white. Therefore, cell (i,j) must be empty, and indeed, it is.

Similarly, for cell (i,j) in R_b and C_w, it's empty, and adding a chip would cause a conflict.

And for cell (i,j) not in R_w ∪ R_b and not in C_w ∪ C_b, i.e., both row i and column j are empty, then placing a chip there would require that row i and column j become non-empty of the same color, which is allowed. But this would violate the maximal condition because you can add a chip without violating any condition. Therefore, such cells cannot exist. Therefore, the setup where R_w, R_b, C_w, C_b are all separate is invalid because it leaves cells where both row and column are empty, which would allow adding a chip.

Therefore, our initial approach is flawed. It seems that the only way to satisfy the maximal condition is to have all non-empty rows and columns of a single color, either white or black.

Thus, the problem reduces to two cases:

1. All non-empty rows and columns are white. The number of white chips is r × c, where r is the number of non-empty rows and c is the number of non-empty columns. The number of black chips is zero.

2. All non-empty rows and columns are black. The number of black chips is r × c, where r is the number of non-empty rows and c is the number of non-empty columns. The number of white chips is zero.

But wait, the problem allows us to have some white and some black chips, but in this model, we can't have both. So, perhaps the maximal condition doesn't allow for both colors to be present. Because if you have both, then you'd have some non-empty rows and columns of white and some of black, which would leave cells that are empty but in non-empty rows or columns, which would allow adding a chip without conflict.

Wait, perhaps the only valid configurations are those where either all non-empty rows and columns are white, or all are black. So, the problem splits into two cases, and we can compute the number of ways for each case and sum them.

In each case, we choose a subset of rows and a subset of columns, all of which are non-empty and of the same color. The number of ways to choose rows and columns for white is C(5, r_w) × C(5, c_w), where r_w and c_w are the number of non-empty white rows and columns, respectively. Similarly for black.

But we have to ensure that the number of chips (r × c) does not exceed 25 for each color. Since in each case, only one color is used, the other color is zero.

But wait, the problem allows us to place up to 25 white and 25 black chips. So, in each case, when we choose r and c, their product must be ≤25, because all the chips are of that color.

So, for each color (white or black), the number of ways is the sum over all possible r and c (with r and c from 0 to 5) such that r × c ≤25, of [C(5, r) × C(5, c)]. But since 5×5=25, any r and c where r×c ≤25 is allowed. But in reality, for r and c up to 5, r×c can be up to 25, which is exactly 5×5. So, all possible r and c from 0 to 5 are allowed because r×c will be ≤25.

Wait, but in the case where r=5 and c=5, that's 25 chips, which is acceptable.

But wait, the problem states that we have 25 white and 25 black chips, but we can use any number up to those amounts. So, in each case (all white or all black), the number of chips used is r×c, which must be ≤25.

So, for each color, the number of ways is the number of possible choices of r and c, multiplied by the number of ways to choose the rows and columns, and then multiplied by 1 (since all non-empty rows and columns must be of the same color).

Wait, but in each case (white or black), the number of ways is the sum over r=0 to 5 and c=0 to 5 of [C(5, r) × C(5, c)], but with the condition that r × c ≤25.

Wait, but 5×5=25, so for all r and c from 0 to 5, r × c is ≤25, except when r=5 and c=5, which is exactly 25. So, all combinations are allowed.

Wait, but when r=0 or c=0, the number of chips is zero, which is allowed.

So, the number of ways for white is the sum over r=0 to5 and c=0 to5 of C(5, r) × C(5, c). Similarly for black.

But wait, that can't be right because when r=0 or c=0, it's an empty set, i.e., no chips placed, which is allowed.

But wait, the problem says "some of these chips," implying that at least one chip must be placed. So, perhaps we need to exclude the case where r=0 and c=0, as it represents placing no chips.

But let's check the problem statement: "place some of these chips." So, "some" implies at least one chip. Therefore, the total number of ways is the number of ways for white plus the number of ways for black minus the overlap (if any). But in this case, the overlap is zero because a configuration can't be both all white and all black.

Wait, but in the cases where r=0 and c=0, it's zero chips, which is not allowed. So, for each color, the number of ways is [sum from r=0 to5 sum from c=0 to5 C(5,r) × C(5,c)] minus 1 (for r=0 and c=0).

Wait, but let me compute the number of ways for white:

Number of ways for white = sum_{r=0 to5} sum_{c=0 to5} C(5,r)*C(5,c) - 1.

Similarly for black.

But wait, the sum_{r=0 to5} C(5,r) = 2^5 =32. Similarly for c. So, the sum over r and c is 32×32=1024. Subtract 1 for the case where r=0 and c=0, giving 1023 ways for white. Similarly, 1023 ways for black. But wait, no, because when r=0 or c=0, the number of chips is zero. But the problem allows us to place some chips, so we must have at least one chip. Therefore, for each color, the number of non-zero configurations is 1024 -1=1023. But that can't be right because when r=0 and c=5, the number of chips is zero, which is invalid. Similarly for other cases where r=0 or c=0.

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to compute the total number of ways for white as the number of ways to choose any subset of rows and any subset of columns, which is (2^5 -1) × (2^5 -1), because we need at least one row and one column to place a chip. Because if you choose zero rows or zero columns, you can't place any chips. So, for white, it's (31) × (31) = 961 ways. Similarly for black, 961 ways. So total ways would be 961 + 961 = 1922.

Wait, but this seems high. Let me think again.

Each color case (white or black) can have any non-empty subset of rows and any non-empty subset of columns. The number of non-empty subsets of rows is 2^5 -1=31, same for columns. So, the number of ways to choose non-empty rows and non-empty columns is 31×31=961 for each color. Since the two colors are mutually exclusive, the total number of configurations is 961×2=1922.

But wait, the problem allows us to place any number of chips, including zero, but "some" implies at least one. So, the 961 for each color includes all possibilities where at least one row and one column are chosen, leading to at least one chip being placed.

But wait, the problem says "some of these chips," which could mean zero or more, but I think in the context, it's at least one. So, the total number of valid configurations is 961×2=1922.

But wait, the problem allows using some white and some black chips, but our model only allows configurations where all non-empty rows and columns are of a single color. Therefore, the only possible configurations are either all white or all black. So, the total number is 2 × 961 = 1922.

But wait, let me think again. Each configuration is either entirely white or entirely black. Because if you have both white and black non-empty rows or columns, it would cause conflicts. So, the only valid configurations are those where all non-empty rows and columns are white, or all are black.

Therefore, the number of ways is 2 × (number of ways to choose non-empty rows and columns for one color).

As each color has 31×31=961 ways, the total is 1922.

But wait, let's check whether this makes sense. For example, when r=5 and c=5, that's the entire grid filled with white or black, which uses 25 chips, which is allowed. Similarly, for smaller r and c, it's allowed as long as they're non-zero.

But wait, the problem allows using any number of chips up to 25 for each color. But in our model, each configuration uses exactly r × c chips of a single color, with the other color having zero. So, the total number of white chips can range from 1 to 25, as can black chips, but in separate configurations.

Therefore, the total number of configurations is 2 × 961 = 1922.

But wait, let me confirm with a small example. Suppose we have a 1x1 grid. Then, according to this model, the number of ways would be 2 × (2^(1)-1)^2 = 2 ×1=2, which is correct: either place a white chip or a black chip. But according to the problem's maximal condition, placing zero chips is allowed only if no chips can be added, which in 1x1 grid would require that both the row and column are empty, which is the case. But in our model, we excluded zero chips because "some" implies at least one. So, perhaps the answer is 2.

But wait, in the 1x1 grid, the problem says "some of these chips," which includes zero or more. But in our model, we considered only cases where at least one chip is placed, which would be 2. But the maximal condition requires that adding another chip would violate the conditions. So, if we have zero chips, then adding a white or black chip is allowed, which violates the maximal condition. Therefore, zero chips is not a valid configuration. Hence, only the two possibilities of placing a white or black chip are valid, which aligns with our model.

So, returning to the original problem, the number of ways is 2 × 961 = 1922.

Wait, but let me think about another example. Suppose a 2x2 grid. According to our model, for each color, the number of ways is (2^2 -1)^2 = 3^2=9. So, for white and black, 9×2=18. Let's see if that makes sense.

For white:

- Choose 1 row and 1 column: C(2,1)×C(2,1)=4. Each of these places 1 white chip.

- Choose 1 row and 2 columns: C(2,1)×C(2,2)=2×1=2. Each places 2 white chips.

- Choose 2 rows and 1 column: C(2,2)×C(2,1)=1×2=2. Each places 2 white chips.

- Choose 2 rows and 2 columns: C(2,2)×C(2,2)=1×1=1. Places 4 white chips.

Total:4+2+2+1=9.

Similarly for black: 9 ways.

Total: 18.

But let's check the maximal condition. For example, placing one white chip in (1,1). Then, row 1 is white, column 1 is white. Any other cell in row 1 or column 1 cannot be placed because adding a chip there would require row 1 to remain white and column 1 to remain white. So, the configuration is valid.

Similarly, placing two white chips in (1,1) and (1,2). Then, row 1 is white, columns 1 and 2 are white. Any other cell in row 1 or columns 1,2 cannot be placed without violating the conditions. The rest of the grid is empty, satisfying the maximal condition.

Yes, that seems correct.

Therefore, applying this to the 5x5 grid, the number of ways is 2 × 31 ×31 = 1922.

Wait, but let me think again about the initial problem statement. It says "some of these chips," which could mean zero or more. But according to our model, the zero-chip configuration isn't allowed because you can add a chip without violating any conditions. Therefore, the total number of valid configurations is 1922.

But wait, the problem statement says "any additional chip placed on the grid would violate one or more of the previous two conditions." So, the configuration must be such that adding any chip is impossible without violating the same-row or same-column color condition.

In our model, when we have non-empty rows and columns of a single color, the empty cells are either in non-empty rows (but their columns are empty) or non-empty columns (but their rows are empty), or both. Wait, no, according to our earlier reasoning, in the maximal condition, all empty cells must be in non-empty rows or non-empty columns. But in our model, the empty cells are those not in the chosen rows and columns. Wait, no, in our model, the empty cells are those not in the non-empty rows and columns, but that would mean that any empty cell is in a row that's empty or a column that's empty. Therefore, the maximal condition is satisfied because you can't add a chip to an empty cell without violating the row or column condition.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let me think again.

In our model, the non-empty rows and columns are all of one color, say white. So, the intersection of non-empty rows and columns is filled with white chips. The rest of the cells are empty. Now, for any empty cell (i,j):

- If row i is non-empty (white), then column j must be empty. Because if column j was non-empty, it would have to be white, and cell (i,j) would have a white chip. Therefore, if row i is non-empty and cell (i,j) is empty, column j must be empty. Similarly, if column j is non-empty, row i must be empty.

Therefore, in this setup, any empty cell is either in a non-empty row (but its column is empty) or a non-empty column (but its row is empty). Therefore, adding a chip to (i,j) would require that row i becomes white (if it's non-empty), which would conflict with column j being empty, or that column j becomes white (if it's non-empty), which would conflict with row i being empty. Therefore, adding a chip to any empty cell would violate the conditions, satisfying the maximal condition.

Thus, the model holds, and the number of configurations is indeed 2 × 31 ×31=1922.

Wait, but let's make sure that in each configuration, the number of white and black chips doesn't exceed 25. Since each configuration is either all white or all black, and the maximum number of chips of a single color is 25 (when r=5 and c=5), which is allowed.

Therefore, the final answer is 1922.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To solve the problem, we analyze the conditions and constraints systematically. 

1. **Conditions**:
   - Each cell can contain at most one chip.
   - All chips in the same row or column must be the same color.
   - The placement is maximal, meaning no additional chip can be placed without violating the previous conditions.

2. **Maximal Condition**:
   - Every empty cell must be in a row that is non-empty or a column that is non-empty. This ensures that adding a chip to any empty cell would violate the row or column color condition.

3. **Non-Empty Rows and Columns**:
   - All non-empty rows and columns must be of the same color (either all white or all black). This prevents conflicts where a cell would need to be both white and black.

4. **Counting Configurations**:
   - For each color (white or black), we count the number of ways to choose non-empty rows and columns. The number of ways to choose non-empty rows is \(2^5 - 1 = 31\) (excluding the empty set), and similarly for columns.
   - The total number of configurations for one color is \(31 \times 31 = 961\).
   - Since there are two colors, the total number of configurations is \(2 \times 961 = 1922\).

Thus, the number of valid ways to place the chips is:

\boxed{1922}
