Okay, so I've got this math problem here about placing chips on a 5x5 grid. Let me try to understand what it's asking. There are 25 white chips and 25 black chips, and I need to place some of them in the grid. Each cell can have at most one chip. The conditions are that all chips in the same row must be the same color, and the same goes for the columns. Also, once I place some chips, if I try to add any more, it should violate one of those two conditions. Hmm, okay.

So, let me break it down. Each row can have all white, all black, or no chips. Similarly, each column can have all white, all black, or no chips. But wait, if a row has all white chips, then each column that intersects with this row must either be all white or have no chips in that column, right? Because if a column has a white chip in a row, then all chips in that column must be white. So, if a row is all white, the columns can't have any black chips in that row. The same logic applies if a row is all black.

Wait, so maybe the grid is divided into regions where some rows and columns are assigned colors, and their intersections are determined by their row and column colors. But how exactly?

I think the key is that each row and each column must be monochromatic—either all white, all black, or empty. But if a row is non-empty, then all its chips must be the same color, and similarly for columns.

But the tricky part is that the arrangement must be such that adding any more chips would violate the conditions. So, the placement is maximal—meaning it's as full as possible without violating the row and column color constraints.

Let me consider how such a grid can look. Each row can be either white, black, or empty, and the same for each column. But if a row is white, then any column that has a chip in that row must also be white. Similarly, a black row forces the intersecting columns to be black. But wait, that's not necessarily true. Wait, hold on. If a row is white, then all chips in that row are white. But if a column has a white chip in that row, does that mean the entire column must be white? Yes, because the problem states that all chips in the same column must be the same color.

So, if any cell in a column has a white chip, all chips in that column must be white. Similarly, if any cell in a column has a black chip, all chips in that column must be black. So, if a row is assigned a color, then all the columns that intersect this row must be assigned that color if they have a chip in this row. But wait, a column can also be empty, meaning no chips in that column at all.

Wait, this seems a bit conflicting. Let me think again. Suppose I have a row that's all white. Then any column that has a chip in that row must be all white. So, if I have a white row, the columns that intersect with that row can't have black chips. But those columns could still be empty.

Wait, no. Because if a column has a white chip in that row, then the column must be all white. So, the entire column must be white. So if a row is white, then any column that has a chip in that row must be white in all its cells. Similarly, if a row is black, any column that has a chip in that row must be black in all its cells.

So, the placement is such that the rows and columns that are non-empty must form a sort of rectangle where the rows and columns are all assigned the same color. So, it's like choosing some subset of rows and columns, assigning each a color, and the intersection of those rows and columns must all be that color.

Wait, but each row can be white, black, or empty, and each column can be white, black, or empty. But if a row is non-empty, its color must be the same as the colors of all columns that intersect it.

So, let me think of it as each cell can be in one of three states: white, black, or empty. But if a cell is white, then all cells in its row and column must be either white or empty. Similarly, if a cell is black, all cells in its row and column must be black or empty.

Wait, no. Because if a cell is white, then its entire row must be white, and its entire column must be white. Similarly for black.

Wait, no, that's not necessarily the case. Wait, no, the problem says that all chips in the same row have the same color. So, if a row has any chips, all of them must be the same color. So, a row can't have both white and black chips. Similarly for columns.

So, the grid has to be arranged such that each non-empty row is monochromatic (all white or all black), and each non-empty column is monochromatic (all white or all black). But also, the color of a row and column can't conflict where they intersect.

For example, if a row is white, then any column that has a chip in that row must also be white. So, the color of the row and column must agree at their intersection.

Therefore, the grid can be thought of as a union of rectangles, each of which is either all white or all black. Each such rectangle must consist of entire rows and entire columns. Because if you have a white rectangle, it must span entire rows and entire columns.

Wait, maybe not. Let me think again. Suppose I have a 2x2 white square in the top-left corner. That would require that the first two rows and the first two columns are all white. Because if any cell in the first two rows is white, then the entire row must be white, and the entire column must be white.

So, in this case, the white region must be a rectangle that spans entire rows and entire columns. Similarly, a black region must be another such rectangle.

Wait a second, so the grid is partitioned into two rectangles: one white and one black, each consisting of entire rows and columns. Or maybe more than two? Because multiple regions might be possible.

Wait, no. Because if I have a white rectangle and a black rectangle, they can't overlap. But also, the regions can't interfere with each other's color assignments.

Wait, perhaps the grid can be partitioned into some combination of white and black rectangles, each covering entire rows and columns, but arranged in such a way that their intersections don't cause color conflicts.

But how? Let me think. Let me try to model this.

Suppose I have some set of rows assigned to white, some to black, and the rest empty. Similarly for columns. But each non-empty row must align with non-empty columns of the same color.

Wait, that makes sense. So, the non-empty rows and columns are of the same color. So, if I select a subset of rows to be white, and a subset of columns to be white, then their intersection must be white. Similarly, for black.

But wait, another way to think about it: the white and black regions must form a partition of the grid, where each region is a rectangle covering entire rows and columns.

Wait, but the grid can have multiple white and black regions as long as they don't overlap and their row and column assignments don't conflict.

Wait, this is getting a bit tangled. Maybe it's better to think of the grid as being divided into four regions based on the colors of the rows and columns. For each row, it can be white, black, or empty. Similarly for each column.

But if a row is white, and a column is black, then their intersection must be empty because you can't have a white and black chip in the same cell. So, any cell where the row is white and the column is black must be empty.

Similarly, if a row is white and a column is white, then their intersection must be white. If a row is white and a column is empty, then the cell might be white or not? Wait, no, because the column is empty, meaning no chips in that column. So, if a column is empty, all its cells are empty. So, the row could be white, but the column is empty—so the cell would be empty.

Wait, no. If a column is empty, then no chips are placed in that column. So, even if a row is non-empty, the cells in the empty column are all empty.

Similarly, if a row is empty, all cells in that row are empty, regardless of the columns.

So, the grid is a combination of some rows and columns being assigned white or black, with the rest being empty. And the cells where a white row and white column intersect are white, where a black row and black column intersect are black, and all other cells are empty.

Wait, that makes sense. So, the grid is partitioned into four parts: white rows and white columns, white rows and black columns (which must be empty), black rows and white columns (also empty), and black rows and black columns.

So, the white region is the intersection of white rows and white columns, the black region is the intersection of black rows and black columns, and the rest are empty.

So, the grid can be represented as two rectangles: one white, one black, not overlapping, and each covering entire rows and columns.

But wait, this seems restrictive. Because the white rectangle would consist of some number of rows and some number of columns, all white, and the black rectangle would consist of the remaining rows and columns, all black. But what about the cells that are in white rows and black columns? They must be empty.

Similarly, cells in black rows and white columns must be empty.

Wait, but in this model, the rows are partitioned into white rows and black rows, and the columns are partitioned into white columns and black columns. So, the grid has four quadrants: white-white (all white), white-black (empty), black-white (empty), and black-black (all black).

That seems to fit. So, the grid is divided into two rectangles: a white rectangle and a black rectangle, such that the white rectangle is in the top-left and the black rectangle is in the bottom-right, or some permutation of that. But the idea is that the white and black regions are each determined by their respective rows and columns.

But wait, no. The white and black regions can be anywhere in the grid as long as they consist of entire rows and columns. So, for example, I could have the first two rows and first three columns as white, and the last three rows and last two columns as black. But wait, then the intersection of white rows and black columns would be empty, and the same for black rows and white columns.

Wait, but in this case, the white region is rows 1-2 and columns 1-3, all white. The black region is rows 3-5 and columns 4-5, all black. And the rest of the cells (rows 3-5, columns 1-3 and rows 1-2, columns 4-5) would be empty.

So, this is a possible configuration.

Another configuration could be that all rows are white, but some columns are black. Wait, no, because if a column is black, then all cells in that column must be black. But if a row is white, then all cells in that row must be white. So, the intersection of a white row and a black column would have to be both white and black, which is impossible. Therefore, if any column is black, all the rows that intersect with it must be black. Similarly, if any row is white, all the columns that intersect with it must be white.

Wait, this is an important point. Let me formalize it:

Let R be the set of rows assigned white, and B_rows the set assigned black. Similarly, C be the set of columns assigned white, and B_cols the set assigned black. Then, the cells in R x C are white, the cells in B_rows x B_cols are black, and all other cells are empty.

But since a row can't be both white and black, R and B_rows are disjoint and their union is all rows. Similarly for columns.

Moreover, if any row is in R, then all columns that intersect it must be in C, because otherwise, the cell (row, column) would be in R x B_cols, which is empty (since R and B_cols would conflict). Wait, no—that's not correct.

Wait, let's think differently. Suppose a row is white (in R). Then, all columns that intersect this row must be in C because if a column had a black chip, then the cell (row, column) would have to be both white and black, which is impossible. So, for a row in R, all columns intersecting it must be in C.

Similarly, for a column in C, all rows intersecting it must be in R.

So, if a row is white, then all columns that are in C must include all columns that intersect this row. Wait, that's not possible unless all columns are in C. Because otherwise, if a row is white, and a column is black, then their intersection must be empty. But how can that happen?

Wait, perhaps I should model this as a bipartition of the grid. Let me think in terms of set theory. Let R be the set of white rows, and B_rows the set of black rows. Similarly, C is the set of white columns, and B_cols the set of black columns. Then, the grid is divided into four regions:

1. R x C: All white.
2. R x B_cols: All empty.
3. B_rows x C: All empty.
4. B_rows x B_cols: All black.

But this requires that R and B_rows are a partition of the rows, and C and B_cols are a partition of the columns.

Wait, but for this to be consistent, if a row is in R (white), then all columns that intersect it must be in C. Because if a column is in B_cols, then the cell (row, column) would be in R x B_cols, which must be empty. So, for a row in R, all columns that it intersects must be in C.

Similarly, for a column in C, all rows that it intersects must be in R. Because if a row is in B_rows, then the cell (row, column) would be in B_rows x C, which must be empty.

So, this implies that R and C are such that R x C is a rectangle covering some rows and columns, and the rest of the grid is B_rows x B_cols, which is another rectangle.

Therefore, the grid is divided into two rectangles: a white rectangle and a black rectangle, each covering entire rows and columns, and not overlapping.

Wait, that makes sense. So, the white region is a rectangle of size a x b, and the black region is a rectangle of size (5 - a) x (5 - b), where a and b are the number of white rows and white columns, respectively.

But wait, no. Because if the white region is a x b, then the black region would have to be (5 - a) x (5 - b). But in such a case, the white and black regions would not necessarily align unless they are in opposite corners.

Wait, for example, if the white region is the first a rows and first b columns, then the black region would be the last (5 - a) rows and last (5 - b) columns. But in this case, the white and black regions don't overlap.

So, this seems to satisfy the conditions. Because all white chips are in R x C, all black chips are in B_rows x B_cols, and the other regions are empty.

So, in this model, the number of white chips is a * b, and the number of black chips is (5 - a) * (5 - b). Since we have 25 white and 25 black chips, we need a * b = 25 and (5 - a) * (5 - b) = 25.

Wait, that's an interesting equation. So, we have:

a * b = 25

and

(5 - a) * (5 - b) = 25.

We can solve these equations for integers a and b between 0 and 5, inclusive.

Let me write both equations:

1. a*b = 25
2. (5 - a)*(5 - b) = 25

So, we're looking for integer solutions (a, b) where 0 ≤ a, b ≤ 5.

First, 25 is 5x5, 25x1, 1x25, etc. But since a and b are between 0 and 5, the possible pairs (a, b) that satisfy a*b=25 are (5,5) because 5*5=25.

Wait, 25 is 5*5, and 25 can't be expressed as other products within 0 to 5 except 1*25, but 25 is larger than 5. So, the only possible solution is a=5, b=5.

Wait, let me check: 5*5=25, which is correct. (5-5)*(5-5)=0*0=0, which is not 25. So, that's a problem. Because then (5 - a)*(5 - b) = 0, which cannot equal 25.

Hmm, so that's an issue. So, there's no solution in this case. So, maybe my initial assumption that the white and black regions are in opposite corners is incorrect.

Wait, perhaps the white and black regions can be arranged in a way that they are not necessarily opposite corners. Maybe the white region is a rectangle, and the black region is another rectangle, but not necessarily in the opposite corner.

Wait, then the equations might not be a*b=25 and (5 -a)*(5 -b)=25. Instead, perhaps a different configuration where the white and black regions could be placed anywhere, not necessarily in opposite corners.

Wait, but how can that be? Because if the white region is a rectangle of a x b, then the black region would have to be a rectangle of (5 - a) x (5 - c), where c is the number of white columns. Wait, no, because if the white region is a x b, then the black region must be in the remaining rows and columns, but the arrangement could vary.

Wait, this is getting a bit confusing. Let me try a different approach. Maybe instead of forcing the white and black regions to be in opposite corners, they can be placed anywhere as long as they don't overlap and satisfy the row and column constraints.

But how? Let me think about what the constraints are.

Each row is either white, black, or empty. Similarly for each column. If a row is white, then all the columns that intersect it must be white. Similarly, if a column is white, all rows that intersect it must be white.

Wait, so if any row is white, then all columns that have a chip in that row must be white. But those columns could be a subset of the columns. Wait, no—if a row is white, then any column that has a chip in that row must be entirely white. So, if a row is white and has a chip in column c, then column c must be all white in that row and all other rows. So, if a row is white, then all columns that have any chips in that row must be white across all rows.

Similarly, if a column is white, all rows that have a chip in that column must be white across all columns.

So, this implies that the white region must be a rectangle that spans entire rows and entire columns. Similarly for black.

Therefore, the grid must be divided into white and black rectangles, each covering entire rows and columns, and arranged such that their row and column assignments don't conflict.

Wait, so maybe the grid is covered by a white rectangle and a black rectangle, but they can be in any positions, not necessarily opposite corners.

Wait, but how? Let's think of an example. Suppose the white region is the first 3 rows and first 3 columns. Then, the black region would have to be the remaining 2 rows and 2 columns. But in this case, the intersection of white rows and black columns would be empty, and vice versa.

So, in this case, the white chips would be 3x3=9, and the black chips would be 2x2=4. But 9+4=13, which is less than 25. So, that's not the case here.

Wait, but the problem states that we have 25 white and 25 black chips available, but we can use any number of them, as long as each cell has at most one chip.

Wait, no. Wait, the problem says we have 25 white and 25 black chips, but we are to place some of them. So, the total number of chips placed can be up to 25, but the constraints on their placement must be such that adding any more is impossible because it would violate the row or column color conditions.

Wait, no, actually, the problem says: "some of these chips" are placed in the grid. So, the number of chips placed is variable, but the conditions must hold, and adding any more would violate the conditions.

So, perhaps the grid can be filled with any number of chips, as long as the conditions are met and it's maximal. So, in the case where we have a white rectangle of a x b and a black rectangle of c x d, the total number of chips is a*b + c*d, and we can't add any more chips without violating the row or column conditions.

But wait, the chips are indistinct; we have 25 white and 25 black. So, we can use any number of white and black chips, but the constraints on their placement must be met.

Wait, perhaps the problem is about the number of possible maximal configurations. So, each configuration is a way of placing some white and black chips such that each non-empty row and column is monochromatic, and adding any chip would violate the conditions.

Wait, so the configuration is a maximal arrangement where every cell that could potentially have a chip either has one or is forbidden due to the row or column constraints.

So, in this case, the grid must be such that every cell is either in a white row and white column (so it's white), a black row and black column (so it's black), or in a row or column that is empty (so it's empty).

Wait, but how does that work?

Let me think of each cell. For a cell to be white, its row must be white and its column must be white. For a cell to be black, its row must be black and its column must be black. If a cell is in a row that's white and a column that's black, it must be empty. Similarly, if it's in a row that's black and column that's white, it must be empty.

So, the grid is partitioned into four regions:

1. White rows and white columns: white chips.
2. Black rows and black columns: black chips.
3. White rows and black columns: empty.
4. Black rows and white columns: empty.

So, the grid is a combination of two rectangles, one white and one black, arranged in a way that they don't overlap and their row and column assignments are consistent.

Therefore, the problem reduces to finding the number of ways to choose which rows and columns are white and which are black, such that the white and black regions don't overlap and the total number of chips is as much as possible without violating the conditions.

Wait, but in this case, the number of white chips is the number of white rows multiplied by the number of white columns, and the number of black chips is the number of black rows multiplied by the number of black columns. But the total chips can't exceed 25 white and 25 black.

But since we're placing some chips, and the configuration is maximal, perhaps the total number of white and black chips could be up to 25 each, but not necessarily.

Wait, but the problem says that we have 25 white and 25 black chips available, but we can use any number of them. So, we can have 0 to 25 white and 0 to 25 black chips in the grid.

But the key is that the configuration is such that adding any more chip of either color would violate the conditions.

So, for the configuration to be maximal, every empty cell must be in a row or column that is already assigned a color. Because otherwise, you could add a chip in that cell without violating the conditions.

Wait, no. Wait, the condition is that adding any additional chip would violate the conditions. So, every empty cell must be in a row and column that are both non-empty (i.e., assigned a color) because if a cell is empty but its row and column are both empty, then you could add a chip there without affecting the row or column color constraints.

Wait, no. If a row is empty, you can add a chip in that row only if the column it's in is also empty or if the column is assigned the same color. But if a column is non-empty, you can't change its color.

Wait, this is getting complicated. Let me think of it in terms of linear algebra. Each cell is a variable that can be white, black, or empty. But with the constraints that:

1. If a cell is white, then all cells in its row and column must be white or empty, but if any cell in a row is white, all cells in that row must be white or empty. Wait, no, that's not correct.

Wait, each row must be all white, all black, or empty. Similarly for columns. So, the grid must be such that each row is monochromatic (including empty as a color). But the color assignments must be consistent across rows and columns.

Wait, perhaps it's better to model the grid as a bipartite graph where rows and columns are nodes, and edges represent cells. Assigning a row and column to a color affects the cells.

But maybe that's overcomplicating it. Let's consider that each row can be in state W (white), B (black), or E (empty). Similarly, each column can be in state W, B, or E.

But the constraints are:

- If a row is W, then all cells in that row must be W or E. But if a column is W, then all cells in that column must be W or E. So, if a cell is in a W row and a W column, it must be W. If it's in a W row and a B column, it must be E. If in a W row and E column, it must be W or E? Wait, no.

Wait, if a row is W, then all cells in that row must be W, or if the column is E, the cell can be E. Wait, this is confusing.

Let me think again. If a row is W, then all cells in that row must be W. But if a column is B, then all cells in that column must be B. So, if a cell is in a W row and a B column, it must be both W and B, which is impossible. Therefore, such a cell must be E.

Wait, so to avoid conflicts, the grid must be such that the W rows and W columns form a rectangle, and the B rows and B columns form another rectangle, with their regions not overlapping.

So, the grid is divided into four regions:

1. W rows and W columns: white chips.
2. W rows and B columns: empty.
3. B rows and W columns: empty.
4. B rows and B columns: black chips.

So, the regions where W and B overlap (rows and columns) must be empty.

Thus, the grid can be represented by two rectangles: one white (W_rows x W_cols) and one black (B_rows x B_cols), where W_rows and B_rows are disjoint and cover all rows, and W_cols and B_cols are disjoint and cover all columns.

Therefore, the number of white chips is |W_rows| * |W_cols|, and the number of black chips is |B_rows| * |B_cols|.

But since the total number of white chips can't exceed 25, and same for black, but in our problem, we can use any number of chips as long as they meet the conditions.

But the problem says that the configuration is maximal, meaning that we can't add any more chips without violating the conditions. So, every empty cell must be in a row or column that's already assigned a color. Because otherwise, you could add a chip in that cell without affecting the row or column.

Wait, no. Let me think. If a row is empty, you could assign it a color, but you have to make sure that all columns intersecting it are also assigned that color.

Wait, but if a row is empty, and a column is also empty, then you could assign a color to both, and place a chip in their intersection. But in a maximal configuration, this shouldn't be possible.

Therefore, in a maximal configuration, every empty cell must be such that either its row is non-empty (assigned a color) or its column is non-empty (assigned a color). Wait, no. Because if a cell is empty, but its row is non-empty, and its column is non-empty, but the row and column are of different colors, that's impossible.

Wait, perhaps in a maximal configuration, every empty cell must be in a row or column that is already assigned a color, but in such a way that you can't assign the cell a color without conflicting.

Wait, perhaps the maximal condition implies that every empty cell is in a row or column that's already assigned a color, but not both. Because if a cell is in a row that's assigned white and a column that's assigned black, it's empty, and you can't place a chip there without violating the conditions.

So, in a maximal configuration, every empty cell must be in a row or a column that's already assigned a color (but not both). Wait, but if a cell is in a row assigned white and a column assigned black, it's empty, and you can't place a chip there because it would conflict. Similarly, if a cell is in a row assigned white and a column not assigned any color, then you could place a white chip there without violating the conditions, which would contradict the maximal condition.

Wait, no. Because if a row is assigned white, then all columns intersecting it must be white. So, if a cell is in a white row and an empty column, you can't place a white chip there unless the column is also assigned white. But the column is empty, meaning no chips are placed there. So, placing a white chip in that cell would require the column to be white, which would change the column's state, but the column is currently empty. So, could you do that?

Hmm, this is getting a bit tangled. Maybe it's better to think of a maximal configuration as one where every row and every column is either assigned a color or is empty, and the assignment is such that no additional chip can be placed. So, every empty cell is in a row or column that is assigned a color, but not both.

Wait, but that might not hold. Let me think. Suppose a row is empty, and a column is empty. Then, you could place a chip in their intersection, which would require the row and column to be assigned that color. But in a maximal configuration, you can't do that, so the only way that can't happen is if every empty cell is in a row or column that's already assigned a color.

Wait, perhaps a maximal configuration is when all the rows and columns are either assigned a color or are empty, and you can't assign any more colors to any rows or columns without overlapping.

Wait, maybe an alternative approach is to think of the grid as being covered by white and black regions, each consisting of entire rows and columns, and the rest being empty. And the configuration is maximal, meaning that you can't add any more regions without overlapping.

Wait, but the problem allows the placement of some chips, so the white and black regions can be any size, as long as they're maximal.

Wait, perhaps the number of maximal configurations is equal to the number of ways to choose a subset of rows and columns for white and black, such that the regions don't interfere with each other, and the configuration can't be extended further.

But I'm not sure. Let me think of small examples.

Suppose we have a 1x1 grid. Then, the possible configurations are: place a white chip, place a black chip, or place nothing. But since it's maximal, placing nothing is not allowed because you can add a chip. So, only two configurations: white or black.

Wait, no, because if you place nothing, you can add a chip, so that's not maximal. So, the maximal configurations are placing a white or a black chip.

So, the number of ways is 2.

Wait, but in this problem, the grid is 5x5, so perhaps the count is similar but more complex.

Another small example: 2x2 grid. How many maximal configurations are there?

Let me think:

1. All four cells are white. This is maximal because adding any more chips isn't possible.

2. All four cells are black. Same reasoning.

3. Two cells white and two black, arranged such that each row and column is monochromatic. For example, first row white, second row black. Then, the columns would have to be white and black accordingly. But wait, in a 2x2 grid, if the first row is white, then the first column must be white, and the second column must be white as well. Similarly, if the second row is black, the first column must be black, which conflicts with the first column being white. So, that's impossible.

Wait, so maybe in a 2x2 grid, the only maximal configurations are all white or all black. Because any other configuration would require that some row or column isn't monochromatic.

Wait, for example, if I have the top-left cell white, then the first row and first column must be white. But then the cell at (1,2) and (2,1) would have to be white as well, which would make the entire grid white. Similarly, if I have a black chip, the entire grid becomes black.

So, in a 2x2 grid, there are only two maximal configurations: all white or all black.

Wait, but what if I have a white row and a black column? Then, the intersection is empty. But that's not maximal because you could add a black chip in the white row's other column.

Wait, no. Let me see. Suppose I have the first row as white (cells (1,1) and (1,2) are white). Then, the first and second columns must be white as well. But if I have the second row as black (cells (2,1) and (2,2) are black), then the first and second columns must be black as well. But that's a conflict because the first column can't be both white and black. So, this is impossible.

Therefore, the only maximal configurations are all white or all black.

Hmm, so in a 2x2 grid, the number is 2.

Wait, but what about a 1x2 grid? The possible maximal configurations are:

1. Both cells white.

2. Both cells black.

3. First cell white, second cell black. But wait, in this case, the first column is white, the second is black. But the first row must be all white or all black. If the first cell is white and the second is black, then the first row is not monochromatic, which violates the condition.

So, in a 1x2 grid, the only maximal configurations are all white or all black. So, two configurations.

Wait, so in grids where the rows and columns can be assigned colors without conflict, the number of maximal configurations is 2: all white or all black.

But in a 5x5 grid, is that also the case? Probably not, because you can have more flexibility.

Wait, in the 5x5 grid, suppose you assign the first a rows and first b columns as white, and the remaining (5 - a) rows and (5 - b) columns as black. Then, the white region is a x b, and the black region is (5 - a) x (5 - b). 

In this case, the total number of white chips is a*b, and the total number of black chips is (5 - a)(5 - b). But we have 25 of each, so a*b <=25 and (5 -a)(5 -b) <=25.

But the problem allows us to use any number of chips, as long as the configuration is maximal.

Wait, but the condition is that adding any more chips would violate the constraints. So, in the configuration where the grid is split into white and black regions, any empty cell is in a row or column that's assigned a color. So, in such a case, you can't add any more chips because any empty cell is in a row or column that's already assigned a color, making the cell's color fixed or impossible.

Wait, no. Because if a cell is empty but in a row and column that are both empty, you could assign a color to both and place a chip there.

Therefore, in a maximal configuration, every empty cell must be in a row or column that's already assigned a color. So, no row or column can be entirely empty if there's an empty cell in it.

Wait, perhaps not. Let me think.

Suppose I have a row that's empty. Then, I could assign it a color, say white, but only if all the columns that intersect it are also assigned white. Similarly for black.

But if a row is empty, and some columns are empty, I could assign the row a color and the columns a color, and place chips there.

Therefore, in a maximal configuration, there can't be any empty rows or empty columns unless all the cells in those rows and columns are already covered by other regions.

Wait, this is getting too vague. Let me try to think of the problem in terms of assigning colors to rows and columns.

Each row can be W, B, or E (empty). Similarly, each column can be W, B, or E.

But if a row is W, then all columns that intersect it must be W. Similarly, if a column is W, all rows that intersect it must be W.

But this is only possible if the W rows and W columns form a rectangle. Similarly for B.

Wait, so this brings me back to the initial idea that the grid is divided into two rectangles: one white and one black, each covering entire rows and columns, and the rest being empty.

So, in this model, the white region is a rectangle of a x b, and the black region is a rectangle of (5 - a) x (5 - b). So, the number of white chips is a*b and black chips is (5 -a)(5 -b).

But since we have 25 white and 25 black chips, we can have a*b <=25 and (5 -a)(5 -b) <=25.

But since the problem allows us to use any number of chips, as long as the configuration is maximal, perhaps the number of white and black chips can vary, but the regions must be maximal.

Wait, but the maximal condition requires that you can't add any more chips. So, every empty cell must be in a row or column that's already assigned a color.

Therefore, the only way that can't add any more chips is if all the rows and columns are either assigned a color or are empty in such a way that any empty cell is in a row or column that's assigned a color.

Wait, but in the rectangle model, the empty cells are in rows or columns that are assigned a color. For example, in the white rectangle a x b, the black rectangle is (5 -a)x(5 -b). The cells that are in the white rows and black columns are empty, and the cells in black rows and white columns are also empty.

So, in this case, every empty cell is in a row or column that's assigned a color. Therefore, you can't add any more chips because adding a chip would require changing the color assignment of a row or column, which isn't allowed.

Wait, but in this model, the regions are fixed once the white and black rows and columns are chosen. So, the number of maximal configurations is equal to the number of ways to choose a subset of rows and columns for white and black such that the regions don't overlap.

But how many such configurations are there?

Each configuration is determined by choosing a set of white rows and white columns, such that the black rows and black columns are the complements.

But the key is that the white rows and white columns must form a rectangle, and the black rows and black columns must form another rectangle.

So, for each possible a (number of white rows) and b (number of white columns), we can have a configuration where the first a rows and first b columns are white, and the remaining are black.

But this is just one specific arrangement. However, the white and black regions can be placed anywhere in the grid as long as they form rectangles.

Wait, but how many distinct ways can we place such rectangles?

Wait, perhaps the number of ways is equal to the number of ways to choose a set of white rows and a set of white columns, such that the white rows and white columns form a rectangle, and the remaining rows and columns form another rectangle.

But in a 5x5 grid, how many such configurations are there?

Wait, for each possible a (0 to 5) and b (0 to 5), we can have a white rectangle of a x b, and the black rectangle of (5 -a)x(5 -b). But this only counts the cases where the white and black regions are in the top-left and bottom-right corners.

But what if the white rectangle is placed elsewhere, like the top-right corner? Then, the black rectangle would be in the bottom-left, but that might not satisfy the row and column assignments.

Wait, no. Because if the white rectangle is in the top-right corner, then the white rows are the first a rows, and the white columns are the last b columns. Then, the black rows would be the remaining (5 -a) rows, and the black columns would be the first (5 -b) columns. So, the black rectangle would be (5 -a) x (5 -b) in the bottom-left corner.

Similarly, the white rectangle can be placed anywhere, as long as it's a rectangle covering a x b rows and columns. So, the number of configurations is more than just the top-left placement.

Wait, but how many distinct placements are there? For each a and b, the white rectangle can be placed in different positions, but due to the grid's symmetry, some placements might be equivalent.

Wait, perhaps the number of distinct configurations is equal to the number of ways to choose a and b, multiplied by the number of ways to arrange the white and black rectangles.

But I'm not sure. Let me think of it differently.

Each configuration is determined by choosing a set of white rows and white columns, which must form a rectangle. The number of such sets is equal to the number of possible rectangles in the grid.

But the number of rectangles in a 5x5 grid is (5+1 choose 2)^2 = 15^2 = 225. But that seems too high because each rectangle corresponds to a possible white region, and the black region is determined as the complement.

Wait, but each rectangle can be placed anywhere, so for each a and b, the number of ways to choose a x b rectangle is (6 -a) * (6 -b). Because for a x b rectangle, the top-left corner can be placed in (6 -a) positions horizontally and (6 -b) vertically.

But since the white and black regions must cover the entire grid without overlapping, the black region is determined once the white region is chosen.

Wait, but no. Because the black region is the complement of the white region in terms of rows and columns, not cells. So, it's not just any rectangle, but a rectangle that is the complement.

Wait, let me clarify. If the white region is a x b, covering some a rows and b columns, then the black region must cover the remaining (5 -a) rows and (5 -b) columns, which also forms a rectangle.

Therefore, the number of such configurations is equal to the number of ways to choose a x b white rectangle and a (5 -a)x(5 -b) black rectangle.

But how many distinct ways are there to choose a x b and (5 -a)x(5 -b) in the grid?

For each a from 0 to 5 and b from 0 to 5, the number of ways to arrange the white and black rectangles is equal to the number of ways to place the white rectangle in the grid such that the black rectangle is its complement.

But for each a and b, how many distinct placements are there?

Wait, actually, for each a and b, the white rectangle can be placed in various positions, but due to the grid's structure, the black rectangle is uniquely determined as the complement.

Wait, no. Because the white and black regions are determined by the rows and columns chosen. So, for example, choosing the first a rows and first b columns as white determines the black region as the last (5 -a) rows and last (5 -b) columns.

But if you choose a different set of a rows and b columns, say the first a rows and last b columns, then the white rectangle is in the top-right corner, and the black rectangle is in the bottom-left.

So, the number of configurations for each a and b is equal to the number of ways to choose a rows and b columns, which is C(5, a) * C(5, b).

But wait, because choosing a rows and b columns, regardless of their order, defines a rectangle. But the position of the rectangle (top-left, top-right, etc.) depends on which rows and columns are chosen.

Therefore, for each a and b, the number of configurations is C(5, a) * C(5, b). But since a and b can range from 0 to 5, the total number would be the sum over a=0 to 5 and b=0 to 5 of C(5, a) * C(5, b).

But that would be (sum_{a=0 to5} C(5, a))^2 = (2^5)^2 = 1024. But that can't be right, because many of these configurations would not satisfy the maximal condition or would result in overlapping regions.

Wait, no. Because each configuration is determined by the choice of a rows and b columns, which defines the white region as their intersection. The black region is then determined as the remaining rows and columns. But the problem is that some of these choices would result in the white and black regions overlapping, which isn't allowed.

Wait, but in reality, the white and black regions are determined by the rows and columns chosen. So, if you choose a set of rows R and columns C as white, then the black region is the set of rows not in R and columns not in C. Their intersection is the black region.

But for the regions not to overlap, the white and black regions must not share any cells. Which is true because the white region is R x C, and the black region is (all rows not in R) x (all columns not in C).

So, the white and black regions are disjoint only if R x C and (all rows not R) x (all columns not C) do not overlap. Which is always true because R and (all rows not R) are disjoint, and similarly for columns.

Wait, no. Because R is a subset of rows, and (all rows not R) is its complement. Similarly for columns. So, R x C and (all rows not R) x (all columns not C) are disjoint.

Therefore, for each choice of R and C, we have a valid configuration where the white and black regions are disjoint.

But in this model, each configuration is determined by choosing R and C, the sets of white rows and columns. However, for the configuration to be maximal, the placement must satisfy that adding any more chips is impossible. Which, in this case, is true because every empty cell is in a row or column that's assigned a color.

Wait, but not necessarily. Because if R and C are such that some rows and columns are empty, then those empty rows and columns could potentially be assigned colors, allowing more chips to be placed. So, the configuration is only maximal if all rows and columns are assigned a color, either white or black, leaving no empty rows or columns.

Ah, that's an important point. So, for the configuration to be maximal, there can't be any empty rows or empty columns. Because if there's an empty row, you could assign it a color, provided all the columns intersecting it are also assigned that color. Similarly for columns.

Therefore, in a maximal configuration, every row must be either white or black, and every column must be either white or black. There are no empty rows or columns.

So, in this case, R is a subset of rows, and C is a subset of columns, such that R and C determine the white region R x C, and the black region is (all rows not R) x (all columns not C). But since there are no empty rows or columns, R must be a non-empty subset of rows, and C must be a non-empty subset of columns.

Wait, no. Because R can be all rows, or a subset, but every row must be assigned a color. Similarly for columns.

Wait, no. Because R is the set of white rows, and the black rows are the complement. Similarly, C is the set of white columns, and the black columns are the complement. So, in a maximal configuration, both R and its complement are non-empty? No, because if R is all rows, then the black region is empty.

Wait, but in that case, the black region is empty, so the black columns would have to be empty. But in a maximal configuration, every column must be assigned a color. Therefore, R cannot be all rows, because then the black rows would be empty, which would allow us to assign black to some columns, which is impossible because the black rows are empty.

Wait, this is getting too confusing. Let me think again.

In a maximal configuration, every row and every column must be assigned a color (white or black). There are no empty rows or columns. Because if a row were empty, you could assign it a color, which would allow you to place chips in that row, provided the columns are assigned the same color.

Similarly, if a column were empty, you could assign it a color, allowing you to place chips in that column.

Therefore, in a maximal configuration, all rows and all columns are assigned a color (either white or black). So, R is a non-empty proper subset of rows, and C is a non-empty proper subset of columns.

Wait, no. Because R can be all rows, but then the black rows would be empty. But since we can't have empty rows in a maximal configuration, R can't be all rows. Similarly, C can't be all columns.

Therefore, in a maximal configuration, R is a non-empty proper subset of rows, and C is a non-empty proper subset of columns.

So, for each row, it's either white or black. Similarly for each column. But the assignments must be consistent such that the white region R x C and black region (R^c x C^c) are disjoint and cover the entire grid.

Therefore, the number of maximal configurations is equal to the number of ways to choose non-empty proper subsets R of rows and non-empty proper subsets C of columns, such that R x C and R^c x C^c are disjoint.

Wait, but since R and C are non-empty and proper, R can be any subset of rows except the full set and the empty set. Similarly for C.

But how many such configurations are there?

Each row can be assigned to white or black, but not all white or all black. Similarly for columns.

Wait, but the assignments are interdependent because the white region is R x C, and the black region is R^c x C^c. So, for each row, if it's white, all columns in C must be white. If it's black, all columns in C^c must be black.

Wait, no. Because if a row is white, then all columns in C must be white. But the columns in C^c can be either white or black, but in our case, they must be black because the black region is R^c x C^c.

Wait, no. Let me clarify.

If a row is white, then all the columns that intersect it must be white. So, if a row is white, then all columns in C are white. But columns in C^c must be black because the black region is R^c x C^c.

Therefore, for the configuration to be valid, the assignments must be consistent. That is, for each row, if it's white, then all columns in C are white, and columns in C^c are black. Similarly, if a row is black, then all columns in C are black, and columns in C^c are white.

Wait, this is getting too tangled. Let me think of it as a bipartition of the grid.

Each maximal configuration corresponds to a choice of a subset R of rows and a subset C of columns, both non-empty and proper, such that R x C is the white region and R^c x C^c is the black region.

Therefore, the number of such configurations is equal to the number of ways to choose R and C, where R is a non-empty proper subset of rows, and C is a non-empty proper subset of columns.

But not all combinations of R and C are valid. Because R x C and R^c x C^c must form a partition of the grid, which they do as long as R and C are non-empty and proper.

Wait, but in this case, R x C and R^c x C^c are disjoint and their union is the entire grid, so yes, they form a partition.

Therefore, the number of maximal configurations is equal to the number of ways to choose non-empty proper subsets R of rows and non-empty proper subsets C of columns.

The number of non-empty proper subsets of rows is 2^5 - 2 = 30. Similarly for columns.

But wait, no. For each row, it can be in R or not, but R cannot be empty or all rows. So, for rows, the number of non-empty proper subsets is 2^5 - 2 = 30. Same for columns.

But each configuration is determined by a pair (R, C), where R is a non-empty proper subset of rows, and C is a non-empty proper subset of columns.

But wait, for each such pair, the white region is R x C, and the black region is R^c x C^c. So, each pair (R, C) corresponds to a unique configuration.

But wait, some pairs might result in the same configuration. For example, if R is the set of rows {1,2} and C is {1,2}, and another R' = {3,4,5} and C' = {3,4,5}, these would result in the same configuration because the white region is {1,2}x{1,2} and the black region is {3,4,5}x{3,4,5}.

Wait, no. Because R and C are independent. So, for example, choosing R = {1,2} and C = {1,2} would give a different configuration than R = {3,4,5} and C = {3,4,5}.

Wait, no, actually, no. Because in the first case, the white region is the top-left 2x2, and the black region is the bottom-right 3x3. In the second case, the white region is the bottom-right 3x3, and the black region is the top-left 2x2. So, these are two distinct configurations.

Therefore, each pair (R, C) is unique and corresponds to a different configuration.

But wait, what about when R and C are swapped? For example, R = {1,2}, C = {3,4,5} would give a white region of {1,2}x{3,4,5}, and a black region of {3,4,5}x{1,2}. But this is a different configuration than R = {3,4,5}, C = {1,2}.

Wait, no, because in one case, the white region is in the top-right, and the black region is in the bottom-left, while in the other, it's the opposite. So, these are different configurations.

Therefore, the total number of configurations is equal to the number of possible (R, C) pairs, which is (2^5 - 2) * (2^5 - 2) = 30 * 30 = 900.

But wait, this can't be right because some configurations would result in the same number of white and black chips but placed differently.

Wait, but the problem isn't asking about the number of configurations with a certain number of chips, but the total number of maximal configurations.

But in the problem statement, we have 25 white and 25 black chips available, but we're to place some of them. So, the number of chips can vary, as long as the conditions are met.

But in our model, each configuration is determined by R and C, with the number of white chips being |R|*|C| and black chips being |R^c|*|C^c|. So, the total number of chips is |R|*|C| + |R^c|*|C^c|.

But in the problem, we have 25 white and 25 black chips available. So, |R|*|C| <=25 and |R^c|*|C^c| <=25.

But the problem doesn't specify that we have to use all chips; we can use any number.

Wait, but the initial problem says "some of these chips", so we can use any number up to 25 of each. But the configuration must be maximal, meaning that you can't add any more chips without violating the conditions.

So, in our model, each configuration is maximal as long as R and C are non-empty proper subsets. Because if R or C were empty or full, you could add more chips.

Therefore, the number of maximal configurations is equal to the number of pairs (R, C), where R is a non-empty proper subset of rows, and C is a non-empty proper subset of columns.

So, for each row, there are 2^5 - 2 = 30 possible subsets. Similarly for columns.

But wait, no. Because for each row, the assignment is binary: white or black. But the subsets R and C are determined by which rows and columns are assigned white. So, the number of possible R is 2^5 - 2 = 30, as each row can be white or black, except the cases where all are white or all are black.

Similarly for C.

Therefore, the number of configurations is 30 * 30 = 900.

But wait, that seems high. Let me think again. Because for each row, it can be white or black, but R is the set of white rows, which must be non-empty and not all rows. Similarly for C.

So, the number of possible R is 2^5 - 2 = 30. Same for C.

Therefore, the total number of configurations is 30 * 30 = 900.

But let's check for a small grid, like 2x2.

In a 2x2 grid, the number of non-empty proper subsets for rows is 2^2 - 2 = 2. Similarly for columns.

So, the number of configurations would be 2 * 2 = 4.

But earlier, I concluded that in a 2x2 grid, the only maximal configurations are all white or all black, which would be 2 configurations. But according to this model, it's 4.

Hmm, that suggests a problem with the model.

Wait, let me think. In a 2x2 grid, the possible R for rows are {1}, {2}, and similarly for columns.

So, possible pairs (R, C):

1. R={1}, C={1}: white region is 1x1, black region is 1x1. But in this case, the black region is actually 1x1, which is (2-1)x(2-1)=1x1. So, the white chips are 1, black chips are 1. But the grid has four cells, so the other two cells are empty. But is this configuration maximal?

Wait, no. Because you could add a white chip in cell (1,2), which would require row 1 to be all white, and column 2 to be all white. But column 2 is currently black, so it can't be changed. Therefore, you can't add a white chip in (1,2). Similarly, you can't add a black chip in (2,1) because row 2 is currently black, and column 1 is white. So, this configuration is maximal.

Similarly, other configurations:

2. R={1}, C={2}: white region is 1x1, black region is 1x1. But this is similar to the first case, just in different cells.

Wait, no. If R={1}, C={2}, then the white region is row 1, column 2: cell (1,2). The black region is row 2, column 1: cell (2,1). The other two cells (1,1) and (2,2) are empty. But is this configuration maximal?

Can we add a chip to (1,1)? It's in row 1 (white) and column 1 (empty). But column 1 is empty, so we could assign it white or black. If we assign it white, then cell (1,1) becomes white, which doesn't conflict because row 1 is white. So, we can add a white chip there, making the configuration non-maximal. Therefore, this configuration isn't maximal.

Ah, so this shows that not all (R, C) pairs correspond to maximal configurations.

Therefore, my earlier assumption that all pairs (R, C) with R and C non-empty proper subsets correspond to maximal configurations is incorrect.

So, the problem is more complex. Some (R, C) pairs result in configurations that aren't maximal because you can add more chips.

Therefore, the number of maximal configurations is less than 900.

So, how can we correctly count the number of maximal configurations?

A configuration is maximal if no additional chips can be placed. That means for every empty cell, either its row is already assigned a color (so adding a chip would require the column to be the same color, which may not be possible), or its column is already assigned a color, or both.

Wait, more precisely, for each empty cell (i, j), either row i is assigned a color different from what the cell would require, or column j is assigned a color different from what the cell would require, or both.

Wait, no. To be maximal, every empty cell must be in a row or column that is already assigned a color, but in such a way that you can't assign the cell a color without conflicting.

Wait, perhaps the correct condition is that for every empty cell (i, j), either row i is assigned a color, or column j is assigned a color, or both. Because if both row i and column j are unassigned (empty), then you could assign them a color and place a chip there, which would violate the maximal condition.

Therefore, in a maximal configuration, every empty cell must be in a row or column that is already assigned a color.

So, in terms of R and C, this means that for every cell (i, j) not in R x C or R^c x C^c, either row i is in R or C, or column j is in R or C.

Wait, no. Let me think differently.

If a cell is empty, it's not in R x C (white) or R^c x C^c (black). So, it's in (R x C^c) or (R^c x C). For such a cell to be empty, the row or column must be assigned a color that would prevent placing a chip there.

Wait, but if a cell is in R x C^c, then row i is white, column j is black. But you can't place a chip there because it would have to be both white and black. Similarly, if a cell is in R^c x C, then row i is black, column j is white. So, you can't place a chip there.

Therefore, in this model, every empty cell is in a row or column that's assigned a color, which prevents placing a chip there. Therefore, all such configurations are maximal.

But in the 2x2 example, when R={1}, C={1}, the empty cells are (1,2), (2,1), and (2,2). Wait, no. If R={1}, C={1}, then the white region is (1,1), and the black region is (2,2). The cells (1,2) and (2,1) are in R x C^c and R^c x C, respectively. So, they're empty, but in a maximal configuration, you can't add chips there because the row and column assignments prevent it.

But earlier, I thought that in the 2x2 grid, such a configuration isn't maximal because you could add a chip in (1,2). But according to this, you can't because row 1 is white and column 2 is black, so their intersection must be empty.

Wait, but in the 2x2 grid, if R={1}, C={1}, then column 2 is in C^c, which is black. So, cell (1,2) is in R x C^c, which is white row and black column. Therefore, it's empty, and you can't place a chip there because it would have to be both white and black.

Similarly, cell (2,1) is in R^c x C, which is black row and white column, so it's empty.

Cell (2,2) is in R^c x C^c, which is black. So, it's black. Wait, no. Because R^c is {2}, and C^c is {2}, so cell (2,2) is in R^c x C^c, which is black.

Wait, no. If R={1}, C={1}, then R^c={2}, C^c={2}. So, the black region is R^c x C^c = {2}x{2}, which is cell (2,2). So, cell (2,2) is black, and cell (1,1) is white. The other cells are empty.

So, in this configuration, you can't add any chips because:

- (1,2): white row and black column → empty.
- (2,1): black row and white column → empty.
- (2,2): black.
- (1,1): white.

So, this is a maximal configuration.

Similarly, when R={1}, C={2}, the white region is {1}x{2}, and the black region is {2}x{1}. So, the empty cells are (1,1) and (2,2). But in this case, cell (1,1) is in R x C^c (white row, black column) → empty. Cell (2,2) is in R^c x C^c (black row, black column) → black. Wait, no. If R={1}, C={2}, then R^c={2}, C^c={1}. So, the black region is {2}x{1}, which is cell (2,1). The white region is {1}x{2}, which is cell (1,2). The cells (1,1) and (2,2) are empty.

But cell (1,1) is in R x C^c (white row, black column) → empty. Cell (2,2) is in R^c x C (black row, white column) → empty.

But in this case, can we add a chip to cell (1,1)? It's in a white row and a black column. So, it's empty, but if we try to place a white chip, the column would have to be white, conflicting with it being black. Similarly, placing a black chip would conflict with the row being white. So, we can't add any chips. Therefore, this configuration is also maximal.

Wait, so in the 2x2 grid, all four possible (R, C) pairs with R and C non-empty and proper subsets are maximal configurations. But earlier, I thought that only all-white and all-black configurations were maximal, but that was incorrect.

So, in the 2x2 grid, the number of maximal configurations is 4.

But let's check:

Possible R subsets (non-empty, proper):

- {1}, {2}

Same for C.

So, possible pairs:

1. R={1}, C={1}
2. R={1}, C={2}
3. R={2}, C={1}
4. R={2}, C={2}

Each of these corresponds to a unique maximal configuration.

So, in the 2x2 grid, the number is 4.

Similarly, in the 1x1 grid, the number is 2 (R={1}, C={1} and R={}, C={}, but R and C can't be empty. Wait, no. In 1x1, non-empty proper subsets are only {1}, but since it's a single row and column, the only possible R and C are {1}, leading to a single configuration. But earlier, I thought it's 2, which contradicts.

Wait, in a 1x1 grid, you can have the cell white or black. So, two configurations. But according to the model, R and C must be non-empty proper subsets. But in a 1x1 grid, the only non-empty proper subset is {1}, so R={1}, C={1}, which corresponds to the cell being white. But you can also have R={}, C={}, but that's invalid because they must be non-empty. So, perhaps in the 1x1 grid, the model breaks down because you can't have non-empty proper subsets.

Wait, perhaps the condition should be that R and C are non-empty, but not necessarily proper. So, in 1x1, R can be {1}, which is non-empty but not proper because the complement is empty. But in that case, the black region is empty, which would allow us to add chips, violating the maximal condition.

So, perhaps for grids where the number of rows or columns is 1, the model doesn't hold.

But in any case, for the 5x5 grid, the number of maximal configurations is equal to the number of pairs (R, C), where R is a non-empty subset of rows, C is a non-empty subset of columns, and neither R nor C is equal to all rows or all columns.

Therefore, the number is (2^5 - 2) * (2^5 - 2) = 30 * 30 = 900.

But earlier, in the 2x2 grid, this model gives 4 configurations, which is correct. So, perhaps for 5x5, it's 900.

But wait, let's think again. The problem states that each cell contains at most one chip. So, in our model, each cell is either white, black, or empty. So, the count is correct.

But the problem also allows any number of white and black chips, as long as the configuration is maximal. So, the answer is 900.

But wait, another thought. For each row, it's assigned white or black. Similarly for each column. But the assignment must be consistent such that for any cell, if it's in a white row and white column, it's white; if in a black row and black column, it's black; otherwise, it's empty.

But the number of such assignments is equal to the number of ways to assign each row and column a color, with the constraints that not all rows are white or black, and not all columns are white or black.

Wait, but each row can be white or black, independently, except that not all are white or all are black. Similarly for columns.

Therefore, the number of such assignments is (2^5 - 2) * (2^5 - 2) = 30 * 30 = 900.

But in the 2x2 grid, this gives 4 configurations, which is correct.

Therefore, the number of maximal configurations is 900.

But wait, the problem says "some of these chips". So, we can use any number of chips, but the configuration must be maximal.

Therefore, the answer is 900.

But let me verify once more with the 2x2 grid. It has 4 maximal configurations, which matches the model. So, scaling up, for 5x5, it's 900.

But wait, another consideration: in the problem statement, the white and black chips are indistinct. So, does this affect the count? Because in our model, we're treating R and C as sets, which are unordered. So, each configuration is uniquely determined by R and C, regardless of the order.

Therefore, the count remains 900.

So, after all this thinking, I believe the number of maximal configurations is 900.

To solve the problem, we need to determine the number of ways to place some chips on a 5x5 grid such that each row and column is monochromatic (all white, all black, or empty), and the configuration is maximal (no additional chips can be placed without violating the conditions). 

### Key Steps:

1. **Understanding Constraints**:
   - Each row and column must be entirely white, entirely black, or empty.
   - If a row is non-empty, all its chips must be the same color, and similarly for columns.
   - The configuration must be maximal, meaning no more chips can be added.

2. **Modeling the Grid**:
   - The grid can be divided into two rectangles: one white (covering some rows and columns) and one black (covering the remaining rows and columns). These rectangles must not overlap.
   - Each cell is either white, black, or empty. An empty cell must be in a row or column assigned a color, preventing the placement of a chip there.

3. **Counting Configurations**:
   - Each configuration is determined by choosing non-empty, proper subsets of rows and columns for white and black regions.
   - The number of non-empty proper subsets for rows is \(2^5 - 2 = 30\), and similarly for columns.
   - Thus, the total number of configurations is \(30 \times 30 = 900\).

### Conclusion:
The number of maximal configurations is \(\boxed{900}\).
