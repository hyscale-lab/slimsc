Okay, let's tackle this geometry problem. So, we have triangle ABC with circumcenter O and incenter I. We're given that IA is perpendicular to OI. The circumradius is 13, and the inradius is 6. We need to find the product AB·AC. Hmm, okay, let me break this down.

First, let me recall some properties. The circumradius R is given as 13, and the inradius r is 6. The circumradius is the radius of the circumscribed circle around the triangle, while the inradius is the radius of the inscribed circle. 

We're told that IA is perpendicular to OI. So, the line from the incenter I to vertex A is perpendicular to the line from the incenter I to the circumcenter O. That seems like an important condition that might relate some distances or angles in the triangle.

I remember that in any triangle, the distance between the incenter and circumcenter can be found using the formula: OI² = R(R - 2r). Wait, let me verify that. Yes, Euler's formula states that the distance between the incenter and circumcenter is sqrt(R(R - 2r)). So, plugging in the given values, OI² = 13(13 - 12) = 13(1) = 13. Therefore, OI = sqrt(13). 

Wait, but hold on, Euler's formula is OI² = R² - 2Rr. Let me double-check that. Yes, Euler's formula is OI² = R² - 2Rr. So, with R=13 and r=6, that would be OI² = 169 - 2*13*6 = 169 - 156 = 13. So, OI = sqrt(13). Okay, that's correct.

Now, since IA is perpendicular to OI, triangle IAO is a right triangle with the right angle at A. So, in triangle IAO, we can apply the Pythagorean theorem. Let's denote IA as the altitude from I to A, which is the inradius r, but wait, no, the inradius is the distance from I to any side, not necessarily to the vertex. Hmm, so IA is actually the distance from the inradius to vertex A, which isn't the same as the inradius itself. Wait, actually, IA is the length from incenter I to vertex A. That's different.

Wait, maybe I should clarify. The inradius is the distance from I to each side, but IA is the length from I to vertex A. So, we need another approach to find IA.

Alternatively, perhaps we can use coordinate geometry. Let me place the triangle in a coordinate system to simplify things. Let's place point O at the origin (0,0), since it's the circumcenter. Then, the incenter I will be somewhere else, but since IA is perpendicular to OI, maybe we can align things such that OI is along one axis and IA along another.

Let me denote the coordinates: Let’s place O at (0,0). Let’s denote I as (h, k). Since IA is perpendicular to OI, the vector IA is perpendicular to the vector OI. Vector OI is from O to I, which is (h, k). Vector IA is from I to A, which would be (x - h, y - k), where A is at (x,y). The dot product of these vectors should be zero.

Wait, but maybe that's getting too complicated. Alternatively, since triangle IAO is right-angled at A, then IA² + AO² = OI². I think that's the Pythagorean theorem here. So, IA² + AO² = OI² = 13.

But AO is the distance from A to O. Since O is the circumcenter, AO is equal to the circumradius, which is 13. So, AO = 13. Therefore, IA² + 13² = 13. Wait, that can't be right. Wait, because OI² is 13, so IA² + AO² = 13. But AO is 13, so IA² + 169 = 13. That would mean IA² is negative, which is impossible. Hmm, that can't be right. I must have messed something up.

Wait, no, perhaps I got the sides wrong. Let's think again. In triangle IAO, right-angled at A, so IA and AO are the legs, and OI is the hypotenuse.

So, IA² + AO² = OI². But AO is 13, and OI is sqrt(13), so 13² is 169, and OI² is 13. So, IA² + 169 = 13, which implies IA² = -156. That's impossible. So, I must have misapplied the Pythagorean theorem.

Wait a second, that suggests that maybe my initial assumption is wrong. Maybe the triangle IAO is right-angled not at A, but elsewhere? But the problem says IA is perpendicular to OI, so the right angle is at A. Hmm, I'm confused.

Wait, perhaps I mixed up the points. Maybe it's I, A, O forming a right triangle, but perhaps the right angle is at I? No, because the problem states that IA is perpendicular to OI, which would mean that at the point where IA and OI meet, which is point I, they are perpendicular. So, the right angle is at I, not at A. Oh! That's probably where I went wrong.

So, if the right angle is at I, then triangle IAO is right-angled at I. So, IA and IO are the legs, and AO is the hypotenuse. So, IA² + IO² = AO².

Wait, that makes more sense. So, AO is 13, IO is sqrt(13), so IA² + (sqrt(13))² = 13².

So, IA² + 13 = 169. Therefore, IA² = 169 -13 = 156, so IA = sqrt(156) = 2*sqrt(39). Okay, that seems more reasonable.

So, IA, the distance from inradius I to vertex A, is 2√39. Hmm, but how does that help us find AB·AC?

Let me think. In triangle ABC, the inradius is r = 6, and the circumradius is R =13. We're to find AB·AC.

I remember that in a triangle, the product of two sides can be related to the area and the semiperimeter. Specifically, area = r*s, where s is the semiperimeter, and area is also equal to (a*b*c)/(4R), where a, b, c are the sides. Hmm, maybe that can help.

Alternatively, perhaps we can use trigonometric identities. Let me denote the angles at A, B, and C as α, β, γ respectively. The inradius is related to the angles by r = 4R sin(α/2) sin(β/2) sin(γ/2). Hmm, not sure if that's directly helpful.

Wait, but maybe if we consider the distance IA. IA is the distance from the inradius to vertex A, which can be expressed in terms of the triangle's angles and the inradius. I think IA can be expressed as r / sin(α/2). Let me check that.

Yes, in a triangle, the distance from the inradius to vertex A is given by IA = r / sin(α/2). Since IA is 2√39, we have:

2√39 = r / sin(α/2)
=> sin(α/2) = r / (2√39)
=> sin(α/2) = 6 / (2√39) = 3 / √39 = √39 / 13.

Wait, √39 is approximately 6.245, so √39 /13 is about 0.48. That's a valid sine value.

So, sin(α/2) = √39 /13.

Then, cos(α/2) can be found using the identity sin²x + cos²x =1.

So, cos²(α/2) = 1 - (39/169) = (169 - 39)/169 = 130/169 = 10/13.

Therefore, cos(α/2) = sqrt(10/13) = sqrt(130)/13.

But how does that help us with AB·AC?

Wait, AB and AC are sides of the triangle. Let me denote AB as c, BC as a, and AC as b. So, AB = c, AC = b, and BC = a.

We need to find AB·AC = b*c.

I remember that in a triangle, the product of two sides can be related to the area and the sine of the included angle. Specifically, b*c = 2*Area / sin α.

Alternatively, since we have the circumradius R, we can use the formula: a = 2R sin α, b = 2R sin β, c = 2R sin γ.

So, AB = c = 2R sin γ, and AC = b = 2R sin β. So, AB·AC = 4R² sin β sin γ.

Hmm, but I don't know angles β and γ yet. But maybe we can relate them through other properties.

Alternatively, let's think about the semiperimeter s = (a + b + c)/2. The area is r*s = 6s. Also, the area is (a*b*c)/(4R) = (a*b*c)/(52).

So, 6s = (a*b*c)/52 => a*b*c = 312 s.

Hmm, not sure if that's directly helpful.

Wait, but maybe we can express sin β and sin γ in terms of other variables. Since the sum of angles in a triangle is π, we have α + β + γ = π.

But I'm not sure how that helps.

Alternatively, maybe using the formula for the inradius: r = (Area) / s.

We know r =6, and Area = r*s, so that's given.

Wait, but to find AB·AC, which is b*c, perhaps we can find expressions involving b and c.

Another approach: maybe using coordinates. Let me try placing the triangle in a coordinate system again, but this time, more carefully.

Let me place point A at (0,0), point B at (c,0), and point C at (d,e). Then, the incenter I can be found using the formula:

I = ( (a*A_x + b*B_x + c*C_x ) / (a + b + c), (a*A_y + b*B_y + c*C_y ) / (a + b + c) )

But this might get complicated. Alternatively, maybe I can use barycentric coordinates or something else.

Wait, perhaps it's better to use trigonometric identities and the given conditions.

Wait, let's think about the distance IA.

We found that IA = 2√39, and IA = r / sin(α/2). So, 2√39 = 6 / sin(α/2), so sin(α/2) = 6/(2√39) = 3/√39 = √39/13, as before.

Then, cos(α/2) = sqrt(1 - (39/169)) = sqrt(130/169) = sqrt(130)/13.

Hmm, maybe we can find cos α using the double-angle formula. cos α = 1 - 2 sin²(α/2) = 1 - 2*(39/169) = 1 - 78/169 = (169 -78)/169 = 91/169 = 13/23. Wait, 91 and 169 have a common factor of 13: 91 =13*7, 169=13². So, 91/169 = 7/13. So, cos α =7/13.

Alternatively, using the other double-angle formula: cos α = 2 cos²(α/2) -1 = 2*(130/169) -1 = 260/169 -1 = (260 -169)/169 = 91/169 =7/13. Same result.

So, cos α =7/13.

Now, in triangle ABC, using the Law of Cosines: BC² = AB² + AC² - 2 AB·AC cos α.

Wait, but we don't know BC, AB, or AC. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps using the formula for the area in terms of AB, AC, and angle α: Area = (1/2)*AB*AC*sin α.

We also know that Area = r*s, where s is the semiperimeter.

So, let me denote AB = c, AC = b, and BC = a.

So, s = (a + b + c)/2.

Then, Area = r*s =6s.

Also, Area = (1/2)*b*c*sin α.

So, 6s = (1/2) b c sin α.

But we can also express sin α, since cos α =7/13, so sin α = sqrt(1 - (7/13)^2) = sqrt(1 -49/169) = sqrt(120/169) = 2*sqrt(30)/13.

So, sin α = 2√30 /13.

So, 6s = (1/2) b c * (2√30 /13) => 6s = (b c √30)/13.

So, 6s = (b c √30)/13 => s = (b c √30)/(78).

But s is also (a + b + c)/2.

Hmm, not sure how that helps yet.

Alternatively, let's recall another formula involving the circumradius R: a = 2R sin α, b = 2R sin β, c = 2R sin γ.

So, a = 2*13 sin α = 26 sin α.

b =26 sin β, c =26 sin γ.

We already found sin α = 2√30 /13, so a =26*(2√30 /13)=4√30.

So, BC = a =4√30.

So, a=4√30.

Now, angle α is at vertex A, so the sides opposite to angles α, β, γ are a, b, c respectively.

Wait, wait, in standard notation, a is BC, opposite angle A; b is AC, opposite angle B; c is AB, opposite angle C.

Therefore, a=4√30, b=26 sin β, c=26 sin γ.

We can also find that angle α is known, as cos α=7/13, so α= arccos(7/13).

But perhaps we can find sin β and sin γ using other relations.

Wait, in triangle ABC, the sum of angles is π, so β + γ = π - α.

Also, from the Law of Sines, we have:

a/sin α = b/sin β = c/sin γ = 2R=26.

So, b=26 sin β, c=26 sin γ.

So, the product bc = (26 sin β)(26 sin γ) = 676 sin β sin γ.

We need to find bc, so if we can find sin β sin γ, then we can find bc.

Hmm, how?

We can use the identity:

sin β sin γ = [cos(β - γ) - cos(β + γ)] / 2.

But β + γ = π - α, so cos(β + gamma) = cos(π - alpha)= -cos alpha = -7/13.

So, sin β sin gamma = [cos(beta - gamma) - (-7/13)] /2 = [cos(beta - gamma) +7/13]/2.

But we don't know cos(beta - gamma). Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps we can find another relation.

Wait, since we know angle alpha, and Euler's formula gave us OI in terms of R and r. We also have the condition that IA is perpendicular to OI. Wait, but we already used that to find IA.

Alternatively, perhaps using the formula for IA in terms of other variables. Wait, we found IA =2√39, and IA = r / sin(alpha/2). So, that's how we got sin(alpha/2)=√39/13.

Alternatively, perhaps using the formula for the distance between the incenter and circumcenter. Wait, we already used Euler's formula to find OI.

Wait, another thought: In triangle ABC, the distance from the incenter I to vertex A can be expressed as IA = (r)/sin(alpha/2). We already have that.

But we also have another expression for IA in terms of the sides. Wait, is there a formula that relates IA to the sides?

Yes, in any triangle, the distance from the incenter to a vertex can be given by IA = sqrt(r^2 + (s - a)^2), where s is the semiperimeter and a is the side opposite angle A.

Wait, let me check that formula.

Yes, I think the formula is IA = sqrt(r² + (s - a)²). Similarly, IB = sqrt(r² + (s - b)²), IC = sqrt(r² + (s - c)²).

So, IA² = r² + (s - a)^2.

We have IA² = (2√39)^2 =4*39=156.

r=6, so r²=36.

So, 156 =36 + (s -a)^2 => (s -a)^2=156 -36=120 => s -a = sqrt(120)=2*sqrt(30).

So, s -a =2√30.

But s is the semiperimeter, (a + b + c)/2.

So, s -a = ( (a + b + c)/2 ) - a = ( -a + b + c ) /2.

Therefore, (-a + b + c)/2 = 2√30 => (-a + b + c )=4√30.

So, b + c -a =4√30.

But we have a=4√30, so b +c -4√30=4√30 => b + c =8√30.

So, b + c =8√30.

Hmm, that's useful.

Earlier, we had from the area: 6s = (b c √30)/13.

But s = (a + b + c)/2 = (4√30 + b + c)/2 = (4√30 +8√30)/2 =12√30 /2=6√30.

So, s=6√30.

So, plugging into the area equation:

6s =6*6√30=36√30.

And (b c √30)/13 =36√30 => (b c √30 )=36√30 *13=468√30.

Divide both sides by √30: b c =468.

So, bc=468.

Therefore, AB·AC= c * b=468.

So, the answer is 468. So, I think that's the solution.

To solve the problem, we start by noting that the circumradius \( R = 13 \) and the inradius \( r = 6 \). Using Euler's formula, the distance between the circumcenter \( O \) and the incenter \( I \) is given by:

\[
OI^2 = R(R - 2r) = 13(13 - 12) = 13 \implies OI = \sqrt{13}.
\]

Since \( \overline{IA} \perp \overline{OI} \), triangle \( IAO \) is a right triangle with the right angle at \( I \). Applying the Pythagorean theorem:

\[
IA^2 + OI^2 = AO^2.
\]

Here, \( AO = R = 13 \) and \( OI = \sqrt{13} \), so:

\[
IA^2 + (\sqrt{13})^2 = 13^2 \implies IA^2 + 13 = 169 \implies IA^2 = 156 \implies IA = 2\sqrt{39}.
\]

The distance from the incenter \( I \) to vertex \( A \) is expressed as \( IA = \frac{r}{\sin(\alpha/2)} \), where \( \alpha \) is the angle at vertex \( A \). Substituting \( IA = 2\sqrt{39} \) and \( r = 6 \):

\[
2\sqrt{39} = \frac{6}{\sin(\alpha/2)} \implies \sin(\alpha/2) = \frac{6}{2\sqrt{39}} = \frac{\sqrt{39}}{13}.
\]

Using the double-angle identity for cosine:

\[
\cos \alpha = 1 - 2\sin^2(\alpha/2) = 1 - 2\left(\frac{\sqrt{39}}{13}\right)^2 = 1 - \frac{78}{169} = \frac{91}{169} = \frac{7}{13}.
\]

Next, we use the Law of Cosines in triangle \( ABC \):

\[
BC^2 = AB^2 + AC^2 - 2 \cdot AB \cdot AC \cdot \cos \alpha.
\]

Since \( \cos \alpha = \frac{7}{13} \), we find \( \sin \alpha = \sqrt{1 - \left(\frac{7}{13}\right)^2} = \frac{2\sqrt{30}}{13} \).

The area of \( \triangle ABC \) can be expressed in two ways: \( \text{Area} = r \cdot s \) and \( \text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \cdot AB \cdot AC \cdot \sin \alpha \), where \( s \) is the semiperimeter. Equating these:

\[
6s = \frac{1}{2} \cdot AB \cdot AC \cdot \frac{2\sqrt{30}}{13} \implies 6s = \frac{AB \cdot AC \cdot \sqrt{30}}{13}.
\]

We also know \( s = \frac{a + b + c}{2} \). Using the relationship \( IA^2 = r^2 + (s - a)^2 \), we find:

\[
156 = 36 + (s - a)^2 \implies (s - a)^2 = 120 \implies s - a = 2\sqrt{30}.
\]

Since \( a = 4\sqrt{30} \), we have \( s = 6\sqrt{30} \). Substituting \( s \) into the area equation:

\[
6 \cdot 6\sqrt{30} = \frac{AB \cdot AC \cdot \sqrt{30}}{13} \implies 36\sqrt{30} = \frac{AB \cdot AC \cdot \sqrt{30}}{13} \implies AB \cdot AC = 468.
\]

Thus, the product \( AB \cdot AC \) is:

\[
\boxed{468}
\]
