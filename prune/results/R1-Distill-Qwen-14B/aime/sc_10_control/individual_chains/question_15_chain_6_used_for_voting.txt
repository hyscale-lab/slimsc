Okay, so I have this problem about counting the number of paths on an 8x8 grid. The paths are of length 16, which makes sense because to go from the lower left corner to the upper right corner on an 8x8 grid, you need to move 8 steps right and 8 steps up, totaling 16 steps. Each path can change direction, and the problem is asking for the number of such paths that change direction exactly four times.

Hmm, changing direction exactly four times. Let me think. So, each time you change direction, you switch from moving right to up or from up to right. Each such switch is a direction change. So, how does that relate to the number of segments in the path?

Wait, right. If a path changes direction k times, then it consists of (k + 1) segments. For example, if you change direction 0 times, you just go straight right then straight up, or straight up then straight right. But wait, that's actually two segments, so changing direction 0 times would result in two segments. Hmm, maybe I need to clarify.

Wait, no. Starting at the lower left corner, you can only move right or up. So, the first segment is either right or up. Then, each direction change adds another segment. So, the number of segments is equal to (number of direction changes) + 1. So, if you change direction 4 times, you have 5 segments.

Yes, that seems right. So, for exactly four direction changes, the path will consist of five segments. Each segment is either a horizontal (right) move or a vertical (up) move.

Now, I need to figure out how many such paths with exactly four direction changes there are. Let's think about how these segments are arranged.

Each path starts either moving right or moving up. Then, each direction change alternates the direction. So, the sequence of segments alternates between right and up. For example, starting with right, then up, then right, then up, etc.

But since we have five segments, and each direction change alternates, the number of right segments and up segments depends on whether we start with right or up.

Wait, if I start with right, then the sequence would be right, up, right, up, right. So, that's three right segments and two up segments. Alternatively, if I start with up, the sequence would be up, right, up, right, up. So, three up segments and two right segments.

So, total segments: 5. So, in either case, the number of right segments and up segments will differ by one.

But since the total number of steps right is 8 and the total steps up is 8, we need to make sure that the sum of the lengths of the right segments is 8, and the same for the up segments.

Each segment's length must be at least 1, right? Because you can't have a segment of length 0; that would mean not moving at all, which doesn't make sense in the context of the path.

So, the problem now reduces to finding the number of ways to partition 8 right steps into 3 segments (if starting with right) or 2 segments (if starting with up). Similarly for the up steps.

Wait, no. Let's think again. If we start with right, then the number of right segments is 3, and up segments is 2. So, we need to distribute 8 right steps into 3 segments, each at least 1. Similarly, distribute 8 up steps into 2 segments, each at least 1. Alternatively, if starting with up, it's 8 up steps into 3 segments and 8 right steps into 2 segments.

So, the number of such paths will be the sum of two cases: starting with right and starting with up.

So, first, let's compute the number of ways to partition 8 steps into 3 segments for right and 8 steps into 2 segments for up, then multiply by the number of ways to arrange these segments, but wait, no.

Wait, actually, no. Because once you decide the number of segments, their lengths are determined by the partitions, but the order is fixed by the starting direction.

Wait, maybe not. Let me think.

No, actually, the direction changes are already determined by the starting direction. So, for starting with right, the sequence is R, U, R, U, R. So, we need to find how many ways to split 8 R steps into 3 parts (each ≥1) and 8 U steps into 2 parts (each ≥1).

Similarly, if starting with U, the sequence is U, R, U, R, U, and we need to split 8 U steps into 3 parts and 8 R steps into 2 parts.

So, the number of such paths is equal to:

[ (number of ways to split 8 R into 3) × (number of ways to split 8 U into 2) ) ] + [ (number of ways to split 8 U into 3) × (number of ways to split 8 R into 2) ) ]

Which is:

[ C(8-1,3-1) × C(8-1,2-1) ) ] + [ C(8-1,3-1) × C(8-1,2-1) ) ]

Wait, because the number of ways to split n steps into k segments, each at least 1, is equal to C(n-1, k-1). That's stars and bars.

So, for splitting 8 into 3, it's C(7,2), and into 2, it's C(7,1).

So, putting it all together:

Case 1: Starting with R

Number of ways for R: C(7,2) = 21

Number of ways for U: C(7,1) =7

So, total for Case 1: 21 × 7 = 147

Case 2: Starting with U

Number of ways for U: C(7,2)=21

Number of ways for R: C(7,1)=7

Total for Case 2: 21 ×7=147

So total number of paths is 147 +147=294.

Wait, but hold on a second. Is that all? Because each path is uniquely determined by the starting direction and the partitions of the steps into segments.

But wait, in the problem statement, I think it's considering all paths that change direction exactly four times, regardless of starting direction. So, perhaps I'm correct in adding both starting directions.

But let me double-check. Each path that starts with R and changes direction four times is counted in Case 1, and each that starts with U is counted in Case 2. Since the total number is 147 +147=294.

But wait, is there a possibility of overcounting? No, because starting with R and starting with U are mutually exclusive.

Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the number of direction changes.

Wait, let's confirm. If a path has exactly four direction changes, then the number of segments is five. So, starting with R would have segments R, U, R, U, R: that's four direction changes, right? Because each switch is a direction change.

Wait, no: starting with R, then U (1 change), then R (2 changes), then U (3), then R (4 changes). So, four direction changes, correct.

Similarly, starting with U, then R (1), then U (2), then R (3), then U (4). So, four changes.

So, each of these cases gives exactly four direction changes.

So, the calculation seems correct, 147 +147=294.

But wait, in an 8x8 grid, moving from (0,0) to (8,8), the number of paths with exactly four direction changes is 294? Hmm.

Wait, but another way to think about this is using the concept of "runs". Each run is a consecutive sequence of steps in the same direction. So, four direction changes would imply five runs.

So, number of runs is five. So, the number of such paths is equal to the number of ways to have five runs, starting with either R or U.

Each run must have at least one step.

So, as before, starting with R: three R runs and two U runs. Or starting with U: three U runs and two R runs.

So, for starting with R:

Number of ways to split 8 R into 3 runs: C(8-1,3-1) = C(7,2)=21

Number of ways to split 8 U into 2 runs: C(7,1)=7

Multiply them since the splits are independent: 21×7=147

Similarly, starting with U: same numbers, 21×7=147

Total: 294

So, same result.

Wait, but another way to think about it: the number of monotonic paths with exactly k direction changes is 2 × C(n-1, k/2) × C(m-1, k/2), but only if k is even? Hmm, maybe not.

Wait, but in our case, the number of direction changes is four, which is even. So, for starting with R, we have three R runs and two U runs. So, the formula would be 2 × C(7,2) × C(7,1) = 2×21×7=294.

Wait, no, because starting with R and starting with U are two different cases, each contributing 147, so 147×2=294.

So, that's consistent.

But wait, let's think about another approach for cross-verification.

Alternatively, we can model this as arranging the steps. Since each direction change introduces a new segment, and the path alternates directions. So, starting with R or U.

Each path is a sequence of horizontal and vertical moves, alternating each time, with five segments in total (four changes).

So, the path is an alternation of right and up moves, starting with either R or U, and having five segments.

Each horizontal segment (if starting with R) is a run of right steps, and each vertical segment is a run of up steps.

So, for starting with R: the segments are R, U, R, U, R.

Each R segment must have at least one step, and each U segment must have at least one step.

Similarly, starting with U: U, R, U, R, U.

So, for starting with R, the number of R segments is 3, and U segments is 2.

So, the number of ways is the number of ways to divide 8 R's into 3 parts and 8 U's into 2 parts.

Which is C(7,2) × C(7,1) = 21 ×7=147.

Similarly, starting with U: 21 ×7=147.

Total: 294.

So, this approach also gives the same answer.

Wait, but perhaps I should think about the total number of paths with exactly four direction changes.

Another way: the number of such paths is equal to the number of ways to choose the positions where direction changes occur, multiplied by the number of ways to split the steps accordingly.

Hmm, but direction changes occur between steps. So, in a path of 16 steps, there are 15 possible places where a direction change can occur.

But we need exactly four direction changes. So, we need to choose four positions out of 15 where the direction changes. But, wait, that's not exactly accurate, because direction changes can't happen in the same place if they're consecutive.

Wait, no, actually, direction changes can happen between any two steps, but each direction change must switch the direction.

Wait, perhaps this approach is more complicated because you have to ensure that each direction change actually switches the direction, so the direction alternates.

So, perhaps it's better to model it as sequences of runs.

Wait, another way: for a path with exactly four direction changes, the number of runs is five.

Each run is a consecutive sequence of steps in the same direction.

So, for starting with right: three runs of right and two runs of up.

Each run has at least one step.

So, for right runs: number of compositions of 8 into 3 parts: C(7,2)=21.

Similarly, up runs: compositions of 8 into 2 parts: C(7,1)=7.

So, 21×7=147.

Same for starting with up: 147.

Total: 294.

Same answer again.

So, perhaps 294 is the correct answer.

Wait, but I've heard of a formula where the number of paths with exactly k direction changes is 2 × C(n-1, k/2) × C(m-1, k/2) when k is even.

In this case, n=8, m=8, k=4.

So, 2 × C(7,2) × C(7,2)=2 ×21×21= 882.

Wait, that's way higher than our previous result. So, which one is correct?

Hmm, maybe I'm confusing something.

Wait, perhaps the formula is 2 × C(n-1, t) × C(m-1, t), where t is the number of direction changes divided by 2.

Wait, but in our case, four direction changes, so t=2.

Wait, let's see: if k=4, then t=2.

So, the formula would be 2 × C(7,2) × C(7,2)=2×21×21=882.

But according to our previous reasoning, the answer is 294.

Which is correct?

Hmm, perhaps I should think of a smaller grid to test.

Let's take a 2x2 grid. From (0,0) to (2,2). Let's count the number of paths with exactly two direction changes.

Each path must have exactly two direction changes, so three segments.

Case 1: starting with R: R, U, R. So, two R runs and one U run.

Number of ways: R runs: C(1,1)=1 (since 2 R's into 2 runs: 1 way?), wait no.

Wait, no, 2 R's into 2 runs: each run at least 1, so it's only 1 way: 1 and 1.

Similarly, U runs: 2 U's into 1 run: only 1 way.

So, number of paths starting with R: 1×1=1.

Similarly, starting with U: same, 1×1=1.

Total: 2.

Alternatively, using the formula 2 × C(1,1) × C(1,1)=2×1×1=2.

Which matches.

But according to our previous approach, it would be:

Case 1: starting with R, number of R runs: 2, so C(1,1)=1; number of U runs:1, C(1,0)=1? Wait, no, number of ways to split 2 U's into 1 run is C(1,0)=1.

So, 1×1=1, same for starting with U, 1×1=1. Total 2.

So, that's correct.

But according to the formula 2 × C(n-1, t) × C(m-1, t), where t=2/2=1, it would be 2×C(1,1)×C(1,1)=2×1×1=2, which is correct.

Wait, in this case, the formula gives the correct result.

Wait, but in our original problem, using that formula would give 2×C(7,2)×C(7,2)=2×21×21=882.

But according to our reasoning, it's 294.

So, why the discrepancy?

Hmm, perhaps the formula is for something else.

Wait, perhaps the formula is for the number of paths with exactly k direction changes, regardless of starting direction, but in our problem, the direction changes are counted as each switch, regardless of the direction.

Wait, perhaps the formula is in terms of the number of runs. Let me think.

Wait, in the 2x2 grid, the number of paths with exactly two direction changes is 2, which is correct.

Similarly, in a 3x3 grid, let's compute.

From (0,0) to (3,3).

Number of paths with exactly four direction changes (since four changes give five segments).

Wait, that's more complicated, but let's try.

Starting with R: R, U, R, U, R.

So, three R runs and two U runs.

Number of ways: R runs: C(2,2)=1 (3 R's into 3 runs, each at least 1: only one way: 1,1,1).

U runs: C(2,1)=2 (3 U's into 2 runs: 1 and 2, 2 and 1).

So, number of paths starting with R: 1×2=2.

Similarly, starting with U: same, 2.

Total: 4.

Alternatively, using the formula: 2 × C(2,2) × C(2,1) = 2×1×2=4, which matches.

Wait, but in the 3x3 grid, the formula gives 4, which is correct.

Wait, but in the 2x2 grid, the formula gave 2, which is correct.

Wait, but in the 8x8 grid, the formula would be 2 × C(7,2) × C(7,2)=2×21×21=882.

But according to the method I used earlier, it's 294.

Hmm, so which is correct?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the earlier reasoning.

Wait, in the 3x3 grid, the formula gives 4, which is correct, as calculated.

But according to the earlier reasoning, starting with R: number of ways is C(2,2)×C(2,1)=1×2=2. Starting with U: same, so total 4. Which is correct.

But in the 8x8 grid, according to the same reasoning, starting with R: C(7,2)×C(7,1)=21×7=147. Starting with U: same, so total 294.

But according to the formula, it's 882.

So, why is there a discrepancy?

Wait, perhaps the formula counts something different.

Wait, perhaps the formula counts the number of ways to choose the direction changes, but in our case, the direction alternates, so the formula might not apply here.

Alternatively, maybe I'm confusing the formula with something else.

Wait, perhaps the formula is for the number of lattice paths with exactly k direction changes, which is 2 × C(n-1, k/2) × C(m-1, k/2) when k is even.

In our problem, n = m =8, k=4.

So, 2 × C(7,2) × C(7,2)=2×21×21=882.

But according to our earlier reasoning, it's 294.

So, which one is correct?

To check, let's consider a 1x1 grid. From (0,0) to (1,1).

Number of paths with exactly 0 direction changes: 2 (all right then up, or all up then right). Each has 1 direction change? Wait, no. Wait, in a 1x1 grid, to get from (0,0) to (1,1), you need to move right once and up once. So, each path has exactly one direction change. So, for k=1.

Wait, but in the formula, for k=1, which is odd, perhaps the formula isn't applicable.

Wait, maybe the formula is only for even k.

Wait, in the 2x2 grid, for k=2 direction changes, we have 2 paths.

Wait, let's use the formula for n=2, m=2, k=2.

It gives 2 × C(1,1) × C(1,1)=2×1×1=2, which matches.

For n=3, m=3, k=4.

Wait, in 3x3 grid, number of paths with exactly four direction changes is 4, as calculated earlier.

Using the formula: 2 × C(2,2) × C(2,2)=2×1×1=2. But that contradicts our earlier result of 4.

Wait, so the formula doesn't hold here. So, perhaps the formula is incorrect or I misunderstood it.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is for something else.

Wait, perhaps the formula is for the number of paths with exactly k direction changes, regardless of starting direction, but when the number of direction changes is even.

Wait, in the 2x2 grid, k=2: formula gives 2, which is correct.

In the 3x3 grid, k=4: formula gives 2, but actual is 4. So, formula doesn't hold.

Hmm, maybe my approach is wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps I should model this as the number of ways to interleave two sets of steps with certain constraints.

Wait, another approach: for each path that changes direction exactly four times, it's a sequence of five runs, alternating between right and up.

Each run must have at least one step.

So, the number of such paths is equal to the number of ways to partition the 8 right steps into either 3 or 2 runs, depending on starting direction, and similarly for up steps.

So, for starting with right:

Number of ways to partition 8 R into 3 runs: C(7,2)=21.

Number of ways to partition 8 U into 2 runs: C(7,1)=7.

So, 21×7=147.

Similarly, starting with up:

21×7=147.

Total: 294.

But then, why does the formula give 882?

Wait, perhaps the formula is for the number of paths with exactly k runs, regardless of direction alternation. So, if you have k runs, which can be any combination of right and up, not necessarily alternating.

But in our problem, the runs must alternate between right and up, so it's a different count.

Ah, that's probably it.

So, the formula 2 × C(n-1, t) × C(m-1, t) is for the number of paths with exactly 2t runs, regardless of alternation.

But in our case, the runs must alternate, so the number is less.

So, in our case, for exactly five runs, starting with R or U, and alternating, the number is 2 × C(7,2) × C(7,1)=294.

So, the correct answer is 294.

Therefore, I think the correct answer is 294, so the final answer is \boxed{294}.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To solve the problem of finding the number of paths of length 16 from the lower left corner to the upper right corner on an 8x8 grid that change direction exactly four times, we consider the following reasoning:

1. **Understanding Direction Changes**: A path that changes direction exactly four times consists of five segments. These segments alternate between right (R) and up (U) moves. The path can start with either an R or a U.

2. **Partitioning Steps**: For a path starting with R, we need to partition the 8 right steps into 3 segments and the 8 up steps into 2 segments. Similarly, for a path starting with U, we partition the 8 up steps into 3 segments and the 8 right steps into 2 segments.

3. **Using Combinations**: The number of ways to partition 8 steps into k segments (each at least 1) is given by the combination formula \( \binom{n-1}{k-1} \). Therefore:
   - For partitioning 8 right steps into 3 segments: \( \binom{7}{2} = 21 \)
   - For partitioning 8 up steps into 2 segments: \( \binom{7}{1} = 7 \)

4. **Calculating Paths**:
   - Starting with R: \( 21 \times 7 = 147 \) paths
   - Starting with U: \( 21 \times 7 = 147 \) paths

5. **Total Paths**: Adding the paths starting with R and U gives \( 147 + 147 = 294 \).

Thus, the number of paths that change direction exactly four times is:

\[
\boxed{294}
\]
