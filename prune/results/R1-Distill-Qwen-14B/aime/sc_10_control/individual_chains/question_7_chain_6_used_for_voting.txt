Okay, so I've got this problem about a regular octagon where each vertex is colored either red or blue, each with a 50% chance. The question is about the probability that we can rotate the octagon such that all the blue vertices end up where the red ones were originally. They mention that the probability is m/n where m and n are coprime, and we need to find m + n.

Hmm, let me start by understanding the problem. We have a regular octagon, so it has 8 sides, 8 vertices. Each vertex is colored red or blue independently with a 50-50 chance. So, each color has an equal probability for each vertex.

Now, the key part is the probability that there exists a rotation (so, a rotation by some multiple of 45 degrees, since 360/8 = 45) such that when we apply this rotation, all the blue vertices move to positions where there were originally red vertices.

Wait, let me make sure I get this right. So, imagine the octagon is fixed in space. Each vertex is colored red or blue. Then, we can rotate the entire octagon (by 0, 45, 90, ..., 315 degrees) and check if after some rotation, every blue vertex ends up on a spot that was previously red.

Alternatively, maybe it's better to think in terms of permutations. Each rotation corresponds to a permutation of the vertices. So, the rotation by k positions would shift each vertex to the next k-th position.

So, the problem is essentially asking: what's the probability that there exists a rotation (i.e., a permutation) such that, when applied, every blue vertex is mapped to a position that was originally red.

But wait, the original coloring is fixed. So, for a given coloring, we have to check if there exists a rotation such that the set of blue vertices is a subset of the red vertices after rotation.

Wait a second, no. Because each vertex is colored either red or blue. So, the original red and blue positions are fixed. When we rotate the octagon, the labels (colors) move to new positions. So, after rotation, each blue vertex (from the original) moves to another vertex. We want that all the blue vertices, after rotation, are now on positions that were originally red.

Wait, so the rotated blue vertices must exactly coincide with the original red positions. No, actually, the problem states: "all of the blue vertices end up at positions where there were originally red vertices." So, the set of blue points (after rotation) must be a subset of the original red positions. Because each blue vertex must be on a red position.

But actually, it's possible that some red positions could also be blue after rotation, but the blue ones must all be on red positions. Wait, no. Let me read it again: "the octagon can then be rotated so that all of the blue vertices end up at positions where there were originally red vertices." So, after rotating, every blue vertex is now on a position that was originally red. So, the rotated blue vertices must be exactly a subset of the original red vertices. But since we can choose the rotation, we need to find if such a rotation exists.

Alternatively, perhaps a better way to think about it is: the set of blue vertices must be a rotation of the set of red vertices. Because if you can rotate the blue set to coincide with the red set, then all blue vertices would end up on red positions. Wait, no. Because if you rotate the blue set to be the same as the red set, then each blue vertex would be on a red position. Because the red set is fixed, right?

Wait, no. Let me think again. Let me denote R as the set of originally red vertices, and B as the set of originally blue vertices. We need a rotation such that when we rotate B by some k positions, it becomes a subset of R. But since the octagon is regular, the rotations are cyclic permutations. So, if B is a subset of R after rotation, then R must be equal to the rotated B. But wait, because if you rotate B and it's a subset of R, then R must contain all elements of rotated B, but R and B are complements. So, perhaps R is equal to rotated B. So, R = rotated B.

Wait, because R and B are complements, each rotation of B would have the same size as B, so if R must contain all the elements of rotated B, then R must equal rotated B, because |R| = 8 - |B|. So, for R to contain rotated B, we must have R = rotated B. Because otherwise, the size wouldn't match.

Wait, let me think: The total number of vertices is 8. R is the set of red vertices, B is the set of blue. So, |R| + |B| = 8. If R is to contain the image of B under rotation, then the image of B must be a subset of R. But since the rotation is a bijection, the image of B has the same size as B. So, to have image(B) subset of R, we must have that |image(B)| <= |R|. But |image(B)| = |B|, so |B| <= |R|. Which is always true because |R| = 8 - |B|, so |B| <= 4.

But that's just a general condition. So, for each coloring where the number of blue vertices is at most 4, we can have a rotation such that image(B) is a subset of R. Wait, but that's not necessarily the case. Because the image depends on the specific rotation.

Alternatively, perhaps a better way is to think in terms of group theory. The set of rotations forms a group, and we're looking for a group element (rotation) that maps B into R. Since the group acts transitively on the vertices, but the structure depends on the coloring.

Wait, perhaps another approach: For each possible rotation (including the identity rotation), check if the rotated B is a subset of R. If for at least one rotation, this is true, then the coloring is counted.

But considering all possible colorings, each vertex is red or blue, so there are 2^8 = 256 possible colorings.

We need to count the number of colorings where there exists a rotation such that the rotated B is a subset of R.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to model this as a necklace counting problem. The octagon is like a necklace with 8 beads, each bead colored red or blue. We're looking for the number of necklaces where there exists a rotation such that all the blue beads are on positions that were originally red.

Wait, perhaps it's equivalent to the number of colorings where the set of blue beads is a union of some rotationally shifted red beads.

Wait, maybe another angle: For a given coloring, the condition is that the set of blue vertices is a subset of a shift (rotation) of the set of red vertices. Because if you can rotate the octagon so that all blue vertices are now on red positions, then the blue set is a rotation of the red set.

Wait, no. Because the red set is fixed. So, if you rotate the octagon, the blue set moves, and you want them to land on red positions.

Wait, perhaps it's better to model this as the set of blue vertices must be a rotation of the set of red vertices. Because if you can rotate the octagon such that B' (the rotated blue set) is equal to R, then all blue vertices are now on red positions.

Wait, but R and B are complements. So, if B' = R, then R' = B, but that's not necessarily helpful.

Wait, no. Because if you rotate the octagon by k positions, the image of B under rotation is equal to R. Then, the image of R under the inverse rotation would be equal to B.

But I'm getting a bit confused here. Let me think again.

Suppose we have a coloring where the blue vertices can be rotated to exactly align with the red vertices. That would mean that B is a rotated version of R, which is the same as R being a rotated version of B. But since R and B are complements, this would mean that the coloring is symmetric in some rotational way.

Wait, perhaps the condition is that the set of blue vertices is a rotation of the set of red vertices. So, for a given coloring, if B is a rotation of R, then there exists a rotation that maps B to R, which would mean that all blue vertices can be moved to red positions.

So, in other words, the coloring must be such that the blue set is a rotated version of the red set.

So, the problem reduces to counting the number of colorings where the blue set is a rotation of the red set. Then, the probability is that number divided by 256.

So, how many such colorings are there?

First, note that the blue set must be a rotation of the red set. So, for each possible size of B (from 0 to 8), the set B must be a rotation of R. But since R is the complement of B, this is only possible if B is a rotation of its own complement.

So, for a set B to be a rotation of R (which is the complement of B), B must be a rotationally symmetric set. Wait, but not necessarily symmetric itself, but rather, it's a shifted version of its complement.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to think about all possible sets B such that B is a rotation of R. Since R is the complement of B, this implies that B is a rotation of its own complement. So, such sets B are called "complemented rotationally isomorphic" or something like that.

Alternatively, perhaps such sets are called "symmetric" in some way. Let me think. For a set B to be a rotation of its complement, there must exist some rotation k such that B rotated by k positions is equal to R, which is the complement of B.

So, for each possible size of B, we can check whether such a set exists.

Wait, but the size of B must be equal to the size of R, which is 8 - |B|. So, that implies that |B| = 8 - |B|, so |B| = 4.

So, only sets with exactly 4 blue vertices can satisfy this condition, because only then can B and R have the same size, making it possible for B to be a rotation of R.

Ah, that's an important point. So, if |B| is not equal to |R|, which is 8 - |B|, then |B| must be 4. Therefore, only colorings with exactly 4 blue and 4 red vertices can satisfy the condition that B is a rotation of R.

So, we can limit our consideration to colorings where exactly 4 vertices are blue and 4 are red.

Now, how many such colorings are there where B is a rotation of R? Well, since R is the complement of B, and we need B to be a rotation of R, which implies that B is a rotation of its own complement.

So, the problem reduces to counting the number of 4-element subsets of an 8-element set that are rotations of their complements.

So, we need to find the number of such subsets.

But how many 4-element subsets of an 8-element set are rotations of their complements?

Wait, but in an octagon, the only subsets that are rotations of their complements are those that are fixed under some rotation. Wait, no, because a subset and its complement being rotations of each other implies that the subset is a rotation of its complement, but not necessarily fixed.

Wait, perhaps another way: Let me consider that the subset B is a rotation of its complement R, which is equivalent to saying that the indicator function of B is a rotation of the indicator function of R.

Which would mean that the characteristic vector of B is a rotation of the characteristic vector of R. Since R is the complement of B, the characteristic vector of R is the bitwise complement of B's characteristic vector.

So, we need a vector of 8 bits where the vector is a rotation of its bitwise complement.

How many such vectors are there?

Well, for the octagon, the group of rotations is cyclic of order 8. So, we can model this as binary necklaces of length 8 with 4 ones and 4 zeros, such that the necklace is a rotation of its complement.

Wait, so the set of colorings where B is a rotation of R corresponds to binary necklaces of length 8 with 4 ones, which are rotationally equivalent to their complements.

So, we need to count the number of such necklaces.

Alternatively, perhaps a better approach is to consider that such necklaces are symmetric in some way. Let me think about the possible symmetries.

Alternatively, perhaps the number of such necklaces is equal to the number of orbits under the action of the rotation group that satisfy the condition that the necklace is a rotation of its complement.

But maybe it's easier to consider that in order for B to be a rotation of R, the set B must be a union of orbits under some rotation. So, for the octagon, the possible rotations are by 0°, 45°, 90°, ..., 315°, which correspond to cyclic shifts by 0,1,2,...,7 positions.

So, for B to be a rotation of R, which is the complement of B, the set B must be a union of some number of full orbits under some rotation. Or perhaps, more specifically, B must be a shift of R, so B is a cyclic permutation of R.

Wait, perhaps a better way is to consider that if B is a rotation of R, then the indicator function of B is a cyclic shift of the indicator function of R.

So, let's model this as follows: Let’s represent the octagon as a binary string of length 8, where each bit is 1 if the vertex is blue, and 0 if it's red. So, R corresponds to the 0s and B corresponds to the 1s.

We need to find the number of binary strings of length 8 with exactly 4 ones (since |B| = 4) such that the string is a rotation of its complement.

Wait, the complement of a binary string is obtained by flipping each bit. So, the complement of B is R, which is the set of 0s in the original string.

So, for a string S, its complement is S', and we want S to be a rotation of S'.

So, the problem reduces to counting the number of binary strings S of length 8 with exactly four 1s, such that S is a rotation of S'.

Hmm, that's a more precise formulation.

Now, how can a binary string be a rotation of its complement?

Let me take an example. Suppose S is a string with four 1s. Let's say S is '11110000'. Its complement S' is '00001111'. Now, is S a rotation of S'? Well, S is '11110000' and S' is '00001111'. Shifting S by four positions gives '00001111', which is exactly S'. So, in this case, S is a rotation of its complement.

Similarly, any string that is composed of four 1s followed by four 0s would satisfy this condition because shifting by four positions would produce the complement.

But there are other possibilities as well. For example, take a string that is '10101010'. Its complement is '01010101'. Shifting by one position would turn '10101010' into '01010101', which is its complement. So, this string also satisfies the condition.

So, in this case, the condition is satisfied by any string that is a rotation of its complement.

So, how many such binary strings are there with four 1s?

Let me think about the possible symmetries.

We can model this using group theory. The rotation group of the octagon is cyclic of order 8, so it's isomorphic to Z_8. The group acts on the set of binary strings of length 8.

We need to count the number of binary strings S with four 1s such that there exists a rotation k (i.e., a shift by k positions) where rotating S by k positions gives the complement of S.

Alternatively, S shifted by k positions equals the complement of S.

So, S_{i} = 1 - S'_{i}, where S' is the complement.

Wait, but since S' is the complement, each bit is flipped. So, for each i, S_{(i + k) mod 8} = 1 - S'_i.

Wait, no. Let me clarify:

If we rotate S by k positions to get S', which is the complement of S, then for each position i, the bit at position i in S' is equal to the bit at position (i - k) mod 8 in S. So, S'_{i} = S_{(i - k) mod 8}.

But S' is the complement of S, so S'_{i} = 1 - S_{i}.

Therefore, we have that for all i, S_{(i - k) mod 8} = 1 - S_i.

Which can be rewritten as S_{j} = 1 - S_{(j + k) mod 8} for all j.

So, this gives us a system of equations that the bits of S must satisfy.

Let me try to see what this implies about the structure of S.

If we let j vary, then for each j, S_{j} = 1 - S_{(j + k) mod 8}.

This implies that S_{j + 2k} = 1 - S_{(j + k)} = 1 - (1 - S_j) = S_j.

So, S_{j + 2k} = S_j.

So, the bits of S are periodic with period 2k.

But since the string has length 8, the period must divide 8.

So, 2k must be a divisor of 8. Therefore, 2k can be 1, 2, 4, 8.

But k is an integer between 0 and 7, so 2k can be 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14.

But 2k must be a divisor of 8, so possible values of 2k are 2,4,8.

So, 2k = 2,4,8.

Thus, k =1,2,4.

So, possible rotation shifts are k=1,2,4.

So, for each possible k in {1,2,4}, we can consider the condition S_{j} = 1 - S_{j + k} for all j.

Let me analyze each case.

Case 1: k=1.

Then, for all j, S_j = 1 - S_{j + 1}.

So, this implies that the sequence alternates between 0 and 1.

Starting from S_0, S_1 = 1 - S_0, S_2 = 1 - S_1 = S_0, and so on.

Therefore, the sequence is periodic with period 2, alternating 0 and 1.

But the length is 8, which is even, so such a sequence has exactly four 1s and four 0s.

There are two such sequences: starting with 0: 01010101, and starting with 1: 10101010.

So, for k=1, there are two possible binary strings.

Case 2: k=2.

Then, for all j, S_j = 1 - S_{j + 2}.

So, the sequence alternates every two positions.

Let's write out the implications:

S_0 = 1 - S_2

S_1 = 1 - S_3

S_2 = 1 - S_4

S_3 = 1 - S_5

S_4 = 1 - S_6

S_5 = 1 - S_7

S_6 = 1 - S_0

S_7 = 1 - S_1

Now, let me try to solve this system.

From S_0 = 1 - S_2 and S_2 = 1 - S_4, we get S_0 = 1 - (1 - S_4) = S_4.

Similarly, S_4 = 1 - S_6, so S_0 = 1 - S_6.

But S_6 = 1 - S_0, so substituting, S_0 = 1 - (1 - S_0) = S_0.

Which doesn't give any new information.

Similarly, for the other equations:

S_1 = 1 - S_3

S_3 = 1 - S_5

So, S_1 = 1 - (1 - S_5) = S_5

Also, S_5 = 1 - S_7

S_7 = 1 - S_1

So, substituting, S_5 = 1 - (1 - S_1) = S_1

Therefore, S_5 = S_1

Similarly, S_7 = 1 - S_1

Putting it all together:

Positions 0, 2, 4, 6 are all equal: S_0 = S_2 = S_4 = S_6 = a

Positions 1, 3, 5, 7 are all equal: S_1 = S_3 = S_5 = S_7 = b

But from the equations, we have S_0 = 1 - S_2, which would imply a = 1 - a. So, a = 1/2. But since a is a bit (0 or 1), this is only possible if a is undefined. Wait, that can't be.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let's go back.

We have S_0 = 1 - S_2

But S_2 = 1 - S_4

So, S_0 = 1 - (1 - S_4) = S_4

Similarly, S_4 = 1 - S_6

So, S_0 = 1 - S_6

But S_6 = 1 - S_0

So, S_0 = 1 - (1 - S_0) = S_0

Which is always true, giving no constraint.

Similarly, for the odd positions:

S_1 = 1 - S_3

S_3 = 1 - S_5

S_5 = 1 - S_7

S_7 = 1 - S_1

So, let's substitute:

From S_7 = 1 - S_1, we have S_7 = 1 - S_1.

From S_5 = 1 - S_7, substituting S_7: S_5 = 1 - (1 - S_1) = S_1.

From S_3 = 1 - S_5, substituting S_5: S_3 = 1 - S_1.

From S_1 = 1 - S_3, substituting S_3: S_1 = 1 - (1 - S_1) = S_1.

Again, no new information.

So, in this case, we have two free variables: a and b, where a is the value of S_0, S_2, S_4, S_6, and b is the value of S_1, S_3, S_5, S_7.

But from the equations, we have that a = 1 - a, which would require a = 1/2, which is impossible because a must be 0 or 1.

Wait, that suggests that there are no solutions for k=2.

But that can't be right because earlier, when k=2, we have the string '11110000' and its rotations, which do satisfy the condition.

Wait, let's test with S = '11110000'.

Shifting by k=4 would give '00001111', which is the complement. So, S is a rotation of its complement.

But according to the equations above, when k=2, we have:

For all j, S_j = 1 - S_{j+2}.

Testing S = '11110000':

S_0 = 1, S_2 = 1. So, 1 = 1 - 1? No, 1 ≠ 0. So, that's a problem.

Wait, that suggests that '11110000' is not a solution for k=2, but for k=4.

Ah, so perhaps I made a mistake in assigning k=2. Because when k=4, shifting by 4 positions, which is equivalent to complementing, as in the earlier example.

So, perhaps the earlier approach is missing something.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that for each possible shift k, we can have a different condition. So, for k=4, let's see:

Case 3: k=4.

Then, for all j, S_j = 1 - S_{j+4}.

Which means that the first four bits are the complement of the last four bits.

So, S_0 = 1 - S_4, S_1 = 1 - S_5, S_2 = 1 - S_6, S_3 = 1 - S_7.

This condition implies that the first half is the complement of the second half.

So, how many such binary strings are there with four 1s in total?

Since the first four bits determine the last four bits (as their complements), the total number of 1s in the entire string would be the number of 1s in the first four bits plus the number of 0s in the first four bits.

Because each 1 in the first four corresponds to a 0 in the last four, and each 0 in the first four corresponds to a 1 in the last four.

So, the total number of 1s in the string is equal to the number of 1s in the first four bits plus the number of 0s in the first four bits.

Which is equal to (number of 1s in first four) + (4 - number of 1s in first four) = 4.

So, regardless of how we choose the first four bits, the total number of 1s will always be 4.

Therefore, the number of such strings is equal to the number of ways to choose the first four bits, with no restriction on their content, as long as they determine the last four as their complement.

So, the number of such strings is 2^4 = 16.

But wait, each of these strings has exactly four 1s. Because the total is fixed at four.

Wait, no. Wait, if the first four bits have k 1s, then the last four will have (4 - k) 1s. So, total 1s is k + (4 - k) = 4. So yes, regardless of the first four bits, the total is four.

Therefore, there are 16 such binary strings where the first four bits are arbitrary, and the last four are their complement.

But wait, let's test with S = '11110000', which has four 1s in the first four and four 0s in the last four. Its complement is '00001111', which is a rotation by four positions. So, this string satisfies the condition.

Similarly, any string where the first four are arbitrary and the last four are their complements will satisfy S_j = 1 - S_{j+4}, so when rotated by four positions, it becomes its complement.

Therefore, for k=4, we have 16 possible strings.

But wait, earlier when I considered k=2, I found that there were no solutions, but when considering k=4, I found 16 solutions.

But earlier, the example with k=1 gave two solutions.

So, putting it all together, the total number of binary strings S with four 1s that are rotations of their complements is the sum over k=1,2,4 of the number of solutions for each k.

But wait, we have to be careful not to double-count any strings that satisfy the condition for multiple k.

For example, the string '10101010' satisfies k=1 and k=2?

Wait, let's check. The string '10101010' shifted by k=1 gives '01010101', which is its complement. So, yes, it satisfies the condition for k=1.

Similarly, shifting by k=2, '10101010' becomes '01010101', which is its complement. So, it also satisfies the condition for k=2.

Wait, but earlier, when I considered k=2, I concluded that there were no solutions because it led to a contradiction. But that's not the case because '10101010' is a solution for k=2 as well.

Hmm, so perhaps my earlier analysis was flawed.

Wait, let's go back to the case k=2.

We had the conditions:

S_0 = 1 - S_2

S_1 = 1 - S_3

S_2 = 1 - S_4

S_3 = 1 - S_5

S_4 = 1 - S_6

S_5 = 1 - S_7

S_6 = 1 - S_0

S_7 = 1 - S_1

So, starting from S_0 = 1 - S_2

And S_2 = 1 - S_4, so S_0 = 1 - (1 - S_4) = S_4.

Similarly, S_4 = 1 - S_6, so S_0 = 1 - S_6.

But S_6 = 1 - S_0, so substituting, S_0 = 1 - (1 - S_0) => S_0 = S_0, which is always true.

Similarly, for the other positions:

S_1 = 1 - S_3

S_3 = 1 - S_5

S_5 = 1 - S_7

S_7 = 1 - S_1

So, substituting:

From S_7 = 1 - S_1, and S_5 = 1 - S_7 = S_1

Similarly, S_3 = 1 - S_5 = 1 - S_1

And S_1 = 1 - S_3 = 1 - (1 - S_1) = S_1

Which again is always true.

So, the conditions are satisfied if we set S_0 = S_4 = S_6, and S_1 = S_3 = S_5 = S_7 = 1 - S_1.

Wait, but S_1 = 1 - S_3, and S_3 = 1 - S_5, etc. So, let's set S_1 = a, then S_3 = 1 - a, S_5 = a, S_7 = 1 - a.

But then, from S_7 = 1 - S_1, we have 1 - a = 1 - a, which is always true.

So, in this case, S_0 can be either 0 or 1, and S_1 can be either 0 or 1, leading to four possible strings:

1. S_0 = 0, S_1 = 0

Then, S_0 = S_2 = S_4 = S_6 = 0

S_1 = S_3 = S_5 = S_7 = 0

So, the string is '00000000', which has zero 1s, but we need four 1s, so this is invalid.

2. S_0 = 0, S_1 = 1

Then, S_0 = S_2 = S_4 = S_6 = 0

S_1 = S_3 = S_5 = S_7 = 1

So, the string is '0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1', which has four 1s. This is valid.

3. S_0 = 1, S_1 = 0

Then, S_0 = S_2 = S_4 = S_6 = 1

S_1 = S_3 = S_5 = S_7 = 0

So, the string is '1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0', which has four 1s. Valid.

4. S_0 = 1, S_1 = 1

Then, S_0 = S_2 = S_4 = S_6 = 1

S_1 = S_3 = S_5 = S_7 = 1

So, the string is '1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1', which has eight 1s, but we need four, so invalid.

So, for k=2, there are two valid strings: '01010101' and '10101010', each with four 1s.

But wait, these are the same as the solutions for k=1. Because when k=1, shifting by 1 gives the complement, which requires the string to alternate. So, the same strings satisfy both k=1 and k=2.

So, in this case, the strings that satisfy k=1 are the same as those that satisfy k=2.

Wait, but earlier, when I considered k=2, I thought there were two solutions, but actually, upon closer inspection, the same two solutions satisfy both k=1 and k=2.

So, in total, the number of unique strings that satisfy the condition for any k (i.e., they are a rotation of their complement) is the sum of the solutions for each k, minus the overlaps.

But perhaps a better approach is to consider that each such string can satisfy the condition for multiple k's.

So, to avoid overcounting, perhaps we should use Burnside's lemma or something similar.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to count the number of orbits under the action of the rotation group that satisfy the condition.

But maybe a more straightforward approach is to note that the strings that satisfy the condition are either:

- The two alternating strings, which are fixed under certain rotations.

- The strings where the first four bits are arbitrary and the last four are their complements, which are fixed under rotation by four positions.

So, the two alternating strings are '01010101' and '10101010'.

The other strings are those where the first four bits are arbitrary, and the last four are their complements. There are 16 such strings, as discussed earlier.

But wait, among these 16 strings, are any of them equal to the two alternating strings?

Yes, the string '01010101' can be considered as the first four bits being '0101' and the last four being '0101' complemented, which is '1010'. But wait, that would give '01011010', which is not the same as the alternating string.

Similarly, '10101010' would require the first four bits to be '1010' and the last four to be '0101', which gives '10100101', which is not the same as the alternating string.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me write it out.

If the first four bits are '0101', then the last four bits are their complement, which is '1010', so the full string is '01011010', which is not the same as the alternating string.

Similarly, if the first four bits are '1010', the last four are '0101', giving '10100101', which is not the same as the alternating string.

So, the two alternating strings are not included in the 16 strings where the first four are arbitrary and the last four are their complements.

Therefore, the total number of strings that satisfy the condition is 16 (for k=4) plus 2 (for k=1 and k=2), totaling 18.

But wait, let me check.

Wait, no. Because the two alternating strings are already included in the 16 strings where the first four are arbitrary and the last four are their complement.

Wait, no, because in the alternating strings, the first four bits are not arbitrary; they are fixed as alternating.

Wait, let me take the string '01010101'. The first four bits are '0101', and the last four are '0101', which are not the complement of '0101'; the complement would be '1010'. So, '01010101' is not included in the 16 strings where the last four are the complement of the first four.

Therefore, the two alternating strings are separate from the 16 strings that satisfy the condition for k=4.

So, in total, the number of binary strings S with four 1s that are rotations of their complements is 16 (for k=4) plus 2 (for k=1 and k=2), totaling 18.

Wait, but I think that's not correct because some of the 16 strings might also satisfy the condition for other k's.

Wait, let's take an example. Suppose the first four bits are '1111' and the last four are '0000'. Then, shifting by four positions gives '00001111', which is the complement. So, this string is included in the 16.

But does this string also satisfy the condition for k=2? Let's check.

Shifting by two positions: '11000011'

Is this the complement of the original string? The original string is '11110000', so its complement is '00001111'. Shifting by two gives '11000011', which is not equal to the complement. So, this string only satisfies the condition for k=4.

Similarly, let's take another string from the 16: the first four bits are '1100' and the last four are '0011'. So, the string is '11000011'. Shifting by four positions gives '00111100', which is the complement. So, it satisfies k=4.

Shifting by k=2: '00110011', which is not the complement. So, it doesn't satisfy k=2.

Therefore, none of the 16 strings satisfy k=2 except the two alternating ones.

Wait, but the two alternating strings are not included in the 16. So, in total, the number of binary strings with four 1s that are rotations of their complements is 16 (for k=4) plus 2 (for k=1 and k=2), totaling 18.

But wait, another thought: The two alternating strings are also included in the 16 when considering rotations. Because, for example, the string '01010101' can be rotated to have the first four bits as '0101' and the last four as '0101', but as we saw earlier, that's not the case. So, the two alternating strings are unique and not part of the 16.

Thus, the total number is 16 + 2 = 18.

But wait, let me check if any of the 16 strings are also part of the two alternating strings.

For example, take the string '01011010' (first four '0101', last four '1010'). Its complement is '10100101', which is obtained by shifting four positions. So, this string is part of the 16.

But '01010101' is not part of the 16 because its last four are not the complement of the first four.

Therefore, the total is indeed 18.

Wait, but let me make sure. How many strings are there in total with four 1s? It's C(8,4) = 70.

So, 18 out of 70.

But let me think again: For k=1 and k=2, we have two strings each, but they are the same two strings. So, total unique strings from k=1 and k=2 is two.

From k=4, we have 16 strings.

So, total is 18.

But wait, another thought: Are any of the 16 strings also satisfying k=1 or k=2?

For example, take the string '11110000' which is part of the 16. Shifting by k=1 gives '01111000', which is not the complement '00001111'. So, it only satisfies k=4.

Similarly, take '11000011' which is part of the 16. Shifting by k=1 gives '10000111', which is not the complement.

So, none of the 16 strings satisfy k=1 or k=2 except the two alternating ones, which are not part of the 16.

Thus, the total number of such strings is 16 + 2 = 18.

Therefore, the number of colorings where B is a rotation of R is 18.

But wait, earlier I thought that for each such string, there's exactly one rotation that maps B to R. But in reality, some strings may have multiple rotations that satisfy the condition.

For example, the two alternating strings can be shifted by 1 or 2 positions to get their complements.

Wait, no. For the string '01010101', shifting by 1 gives '10101010', which is its complement. Similarly, shifting by 2 gives '01010101' again? Wait, no.

Wait, '01010101' shifted by 1 is '10101010', which is its complement.

Shifted by 2, it would be '01010101' again? No, wait, shifting by 2 would give '01010101' shifted twice, which is '01010101' again? No, because shifting by 2 would move each bit two positions to the right, with wrap-around.

Wait, let me write it out:

Original: 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1

Shift by 1: 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0

Shift by 2: 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1

So, shifting by 2 brings us back to the original string.

Wait, that's interesting. So, the string '01010101' is periodic with period 2.

Similarly, shifting by 4 would also bring it back.

So, in this case, the string is fixed under shifts of 2 and 4 positions.

Therefore, for the two alternating strings, there are multiple rotations that satisfy the condition.

But in terms of counting the number of colorings, each of these strings is unique, so we don't have to worry about overcounting them.

Wait, but in our earlier count, we have 16 strings for k=4 and two strings for k=1 and k=2.

But wait, for k=4, each of the 16 strings has exactly one rotation (shifting by 4) that maps B to R.

For the two alternating strings, shifting by 1 or 2 positions maps B to R.

But regardless, in the count of 18, each of these colorings is unique, so the total is 18.

Therefore, the number of favorable colorings is 18.

But wait, earlier I thought that the two alternating strings are part of the 16, but now I'm seeing that they are separate.

Wait, perhaps it's better to model this as the union of two sets: the set of strings fixed under rotation by 4 positions (the 16 strings), and the set of strings fixed under rotation by 1 or 2 positions (the two alternating strings). Since these sets are disjoint, the total number is 16 + 2 = 18.

Therefore, the number of favorable colorings is 18.

Thus, the probability is 18 / 256.

Simplify that: 18 and 256 are both divisible by 2. So, 9/128.

So, m = 9, n = 128. They are coprime.

Therefore, m + n = 9 + 128 = 137.

The problem involves a regular octagon where each vertex is independently colored red or blue with equal probability. We need to find the probability that there exists a rotation such that all blue vertices end up on positions that were originally red. 

### Key Steps:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: Each vertex is colored red or blue. We need a rotation such that every blue vertex moves to a position that was originally red. This implies that the set of blue vertices must be a rotation of the set of red vertices.

2. **Binary Representation**: Represent the octagon as an 8-bit binary string, where 1 represents blue and 0 represents red. We need binary strings of length 8 with exactly four 1s (blue vertices) that are rotations of their complements (red vertices).

3. **Counting Valid Strings**:
   - **Case 1 (k=1)**: Strings that alternate between 1s and 0s. There are two such strings: `01010101` and `10101010`.
   - **Case 2 (k=2)**: No valid strings as it leads to contradictions.
   - **Case 3 (k=4)**: Strings where the first four bits are arbitrary, and the last four are their complements. There are 16 such strings.

4. **Total Valid Strings**: The total number of valid strings is 16 (for k=4) + 2 (for k=1) = 18.

5. **Probability Calculation**: The total number of possible colorings is \(2^8 = 256\). The probability is \( \frac{18}{256} = \frac{9}{128} \).

6. **Final Answer**: The fraction \( \frac{9}{128} \) is in simplest terms, so \( m + n = 9 + 128 = 137 \).

**Answer**: \boxed{137}
