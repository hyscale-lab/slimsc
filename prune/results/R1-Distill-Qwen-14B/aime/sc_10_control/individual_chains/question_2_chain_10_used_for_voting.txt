Okay, so I've got this problem here with points O, A, and B. O is at (0,0), A is at (1/2, 0), and B is at (0, sqrt(3)/2). Then there's this family F of segments PQ of unit length lying in the first quadrant, with P on the x-axis and Q on the y-axis. So each PQ is a segment from the x-axis to the y-axis, length 1, all in the first quadrant.

The question is about a unique point C on AB, not being A or B, that's not on any other segment from F except AB. Then we need to find OC², which is the square of the distance from the origin to point C, and express it as p/q where p and q are coprime, then find p+q.

Hmm, okay. So first, let me visualize this. Points O, A, B. O is the origin. A is halfway between O and (1,0), since it's at (1/2, 0). B is on the y-axis at (0, sqrt(3)/2), which is a bit less than (0,1) because sqrt(3)/2 is approximately 0.866.

So AB is a line segment connecting A(1/2, 0) and B(0, sqrt(3)/2). Let me find the equation of line AB. The slope of AB would be (sqrt(3)/2 - 0)/(0 - 1/2) = (sqrt(3)/2)/(-1/2) = -sqrt(3). So the slope is -sqrt(3). Then the equation of AB is y - 0 = -sqrt(3)(x - 1/2), so y = -sqrt(3)x + (sqrt(3)/2).

So any point C on AB can be parametrized as (x, -sqrt(3)x + sqrt(3)/2). Or maybe it's better to parameterize it with a parameter t, where t goes from 0 to 1. Let me see.

Parametrizing AB from A to B: when t=0, we are at A(1/2, 0), and when t=1, we are at B(0, sqrt(3)/2). So the parametric equations would be x = 1/2 - (1/2)t, and y = 0 + (sqrt(3)/2)t. So x = (1 - t)/2, y = (sqrt(3)/2) t.

So point C is ((1 - t)/2, (sqrt(3)/2) t), where t is between 0 and 1.

Now, we need to find the point C on AB which is not on any other segment from F except AB. So, for all other segments PQ in F (other than AB), C should not lie on PQ.

What are these segments PQ? Each PQ is a unit length segment from the x-axis to the y-axis in the first quadrant. So, for any point P on the x-axis, say at (p, 0), the point Q on the y-axis would be at (0, q) such that the distance between P and Q is 1. So sqrt(p² + q²) = 1. So q = sqrt(1 - p²). Since we're in the first quadrant, p and q are between 0 and 1.

So each PQ is a line segment from (p,0) to (0, sqrt(1 - p²)), for p in [0,1].

So the family F is all such segments for p from 0 to 1.

We need to find a point C on AB such that C is only on AB and no other PQ in F.

So, for point C, the equations of all PQ in F should not pass through C, except for AB.

Wait, but AB is in F? Let me check. AB is a segment from A(1/2, 0) to B(0, sqrt(3)/2). The length of AB is sqrt( (1/2)^2 + (sqrt(3)/2)^2 ) = sqrt(1/4 + 3/4) = sqrt(1) = 1. So AB is indeed in F.

So AB is one such PQ in F, and C is on AB. But C shouldn't lie on any other PQ in F.

So, we need to find a point C on AB such that there is no other p ≠ 1/2 for which the line segment from (p, 0) to (0, sqrt(1 - p²)) passes through C.

So, point C must not lie on any of these other PQs.

So, to find such a C, we need that for any other p, the line PQ (from (p,0) to (0, sqrt(1-p²))) does not pass through C.

Alternatively, the equation of the line PQ, for any p ≠ 1/2, should not contain point C.

So, perhaps we can model this by considering the equation of a general PQ and then seeing for which C the equation is only satisfied when p=1/2.

So, let's find the equation of the line PQ for a general p.

P is at (p, 0), Q is at (0, q) where q = sqrt(1 - p²). So the equation of PQ is (x/p) + (y/q) = 1.

So, for any p, the line PQ is given by x/p + y/q = 1, where q = sqrt(1 - p²).

We can write this as x/p + y / sqrt(1 - p²) = 1.

So, if point C is on PQ, then ((1 - t)/2)/p + ( (sqrt(3)/2) t ) / sqrt(1 - p²) = 1.

So, for each t, this equation must have exactly one solution p (which is p=1/2 when t is in [0,1]), but for other p, no solution except p=1/2.

Wait, but we need that for all other p, this equation is not satisfied for any t.

Wait, maybe I'm approaching this incorrectly. Let's think differently.

For a given point C on AB, we can check whether it lies on some PQ other than AB. So, if C is on AB, which is PQ with p=1/2, then to ensure that C is not on any other PQ, we have to ensure that the system:

x/p + y / sqrt(1 - p²) = 1,

along with the equation of AB,

must have no solutions except when p=1/2.

Alternatively, for point C, the equation x/p + y / sqrt(1 - p²) = 1 has only one solution p = 1/2.

So, to find such a C, we can set up the equation:

( (1 - t)/2 ) / p + ( (sqrt(3)/2) t ) / sqrt(1 - p²) = 1.

We can rearrange this equation to see for which t this equation has only one solution p=1/2.

Alternatively, perhaps we can set this equation and the equation of AB, and find when the only solution is p=1/2.

Wait, but maybe another approach is to find the envelope of all these lines PQ. The envelope is the set of points that are touched by exactly one PQ. So, the point C must lie on the envelope of F. Because if a point lies on the envelope, it's only touched by one PQ, which would be AB.

So, to find the envelope of the family F, we can use calculus.

The envelope of a family of curves is found by solving the system:

F(p, x, y) = 0,

dF/dp = 0,

where F(p, x, y) = x/p + y / sqrt(1 - p²) - 1.

So, let's compute dF/dp and set it to zero.

Compute dF/dp:

d/dp [x/p + y / sqrt(1 - p²) - 1] = -x / p² + y * ( (1/2)(1 - p²)^(-3/2) * 2p ) ).

Simplify:

= -x / p² + y * ( p / (1 - p²)^(3/2) )

So, the two equations are:

1. x/p + y / sqrt(1 - p²) = 1,

2. -x / p² + y * p / (1 - p²)^(3/2) = 0.

We can solve these two equations for x and y in terms of p. The resulting parametric equations will give the envelope.

Let me write equation 1 as:

x/p + y / sqrt(1 - p²) = 1.

Equation 2:

(-x)/p² + y * p / (1 - p²)^(3/2) = 0.

Let me denote q = sqrt(1 - p²). Then q² = 1 - p², so p² = 1 - q².

But maybe it's better to express x and y in terms of p.

Let me solve equation 2 for x in terms of y.

Equation 2:

(-x)/p² + y * p / (1 - p²)^(3/2) = 0.

Multiply both sides by p²:

-x + y * p³ / (1 - p²)^(3/2) = 0.

So,

x = y * p³ / (1 - p²)^(3/2).

Now, substitute this into equation 1:

( y * p³ / (1 - p²)^(3/2) ) / p + y / sqrt(1 - p²) = 1.

Simplify:

y * p² / (1 - p²)^(3/2) + y / sqrt(1 - p²) = 1.

Factor out y / (1 - p²)^(3/2):

y [ p² + (1 - p²) ] / (1 - p²)^(3/2) = 1.

Simplify the numerator:

p² + 1 - p² = 1.

So, y / (1 - p²)^(3/2) = 1.

Thus,

y = (1 - p²)^(3/2).

So, we have:

x = y * p³ / (1 - p²)^(3/2).

Substituting y:

x = (1 - p²)^(3/2) * p³ / (1 - p²)^(3/2) ) = p³.

So, x = p³,

y = (1 - p²)^(3/2).

So, the envelope is parametrized by p as:

x = p³,

y = (1 - p²)^(3/2).

Now, we need to find the point C on AB that also lies on this envelope.

So, point C is on both AB and the envelope.

AB is parametrized as:

x = (1 - t)/2,

y = (sqrt(3)/2) t,

for t in [0,1].

The envelope is parametrized as:

x = p³,

y = (1 - p²)^(3/2).

So, we can set:

(1 - t)/2 = p³,

and

(sqrt(3)/2) t = (1 - p²)^(3/2).

So, we have two equations:

1. (1 - t)/2 = p³,

2. (sqrt(3)/2) t = (1 - p²)^(3/2).

We can solve these equations for t and p.

Let me express t from equation 1:

t = 1 - 2 p³.

Substitute into equation 2:

sqrt(3)/2 * (1 - 2 p³) = (1 - p²)^(3/2).

Let's square both sides to eliminate the square roots. But before that, let me write equation 2 as:

sqrt(3)/2 * (1 - 2 p³) = (1 - p²)^(3/2).

Square both sides:

(3/4) (1 - 2 p³)^2 = (1 - p²)^3.

Expand the left side:

3/4 * (1 - 4 p³ + 4 p^6) = 1 - 3 p² + 3 p^4 - p^6.

Multiply out:

3/4 - 3 p³ + 3 p^6 = 1 - 3 p² + 3 p^4 - p^6.

Bring all terms to one side:

3/4 - 3 p³ + 3 p^6 - 1 + 3 p² - 3 p^4 + p^6 = 0.

Simplify:

(3/4 - 1) + 3 p² -3 p³ -3 p^4 + (3 p^6 + p^6) = 0.

Which is:

-1/4 + 3 p² -3 p³ -3 p^4 +4 p^6 = 0.

Multiply both sides by 4 to eliminate the fraction:

-1 + 12 p² -12 p³ -12 p^4 +16 p^6 = 0.

Rearranged:

16 p^6 -12 p^4 -12 p³ +12 p² -1 =0.

Hmm, that's a sixth-degree polynomial. That seems complicated. Maybe I made a mistake in the algebra.

Wait, let me check the expansion step again.

Original equation after squaring:

3/4 (1 - 4 p³ + 4 p^6) = 1 - 3 p² + 3 p^4 - p^6.

Left side: 3/4 - 3 p³ + 3 p^6.

Right side: 1 - 3 p² + 3 p^4 - p^6.

Bring everything to the left:

3/4 -3 p³ +3 p^6 -1 +3 p² -3 p^4 + p^6 =0.

So:

(3/4 -1) = -1/4,

3 p²,

-3 p³,

-3 p^4,

(3 p^6 + p^6) =4 p^6.

So, equation is:

-1/4 +3 p² -3 p³ -3 p^4 +4 p^6 =0.

Multiply by 4:

-1 +12 p² -12 p³ -12 p^4 +16 p^6 =0.

So, the equation is 16 p^6 -12 p^4 -12 p³ +12 p² -1 =0.

Hmm, this seems tough. Maybe it's factorable. Let me try to factor it.

Let me write it as:

16 p^6 -12 p^4 -12 p^3 +12 p^2 -1 =0.

Trying to factor, maybe group terms.

Group terms as (16 p^6 -1) + (-12 p^4 +12 p²) -12 p^3.

Hmm, 16 p^6 -1 is (4 p^3)^2 -1^2 = (4 p^3 -1)(4 p^3 +1).

So, 16 p^6 -1 = (4 p^3 -1)(4 p^3 +1).

Then, the other terms: -12 p^4 +12 p² = -12 p²(p² -1) = -12 p² (p -1)(p +1).

Hmm, not sure if that helps. Alternatively, maybe factor the entire polynomial.

Alternatively, perhaps p=1 is a root. Let me plug p=1:

16(1)^6 -12(1)^4 -12(1)^3 +12(1)^2 -1 =16 -12 -12 +12 -1= 16-12=4; 4-12= -8; -8+12=4; 4-1=3≠0.

p=1 is not a root.

p=1/2: Let's compute f(1/2):

16*(1/2)^6=16*(1/64)=1/4,

-12*(1/2)^4= -12*(1/16)= -3/4,

-12*(1/2)^3= -12*(1/8)= -3/2,

12*(1/2)^2=12*(1/4)=3,

-1.

So sum:

1/4 -3/4 -3/2 +3 -1.

Compute step by step:

1/4 -3/4 = -2/4 = -1/2.

-1/2 -3/2 = -2.

-2 +3 =1.

1 -1=0.

So p=1/2 is a root.

Therefore, (p - 1/2) is a factor.

So let's perform polynomial division.

Divide 16 p^6 -12 p^4 -12 p^3 +12 p^2 -1 by (p - 1/2).

Alternatively, perhaps factor out (p - 1/2). Let me use synthetic division.

But since the polynomial is in p, and the root is p=1/2, perhaps we can write it as (p - 1/2)( ... ) =0.

Using polynomial long division or synthetic division.

Alternatively, let me write the polynomial as:

16 p^6 -12 p^4 -12 p^3 +12 p^2 -1.

Let me factor out (p - 1/2). Let me set p = 1/2.

But when p=1/2, it's a root, so we can factor.

But this is going to be complicated. Maybe a better approach is to let u = p², but since it's a sixth-degree polynomial, perhaps that's not helpful.

Alternatively, perhaps think of substitution.

Wait, another approach: since p=1/2 is a root, perhaps the polynomial can be expressed as (p - 1/2)(something). Let me try to perform the division.

But this might take a while. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in setting up the equations earlier, leading to a more complicated polynomial.

Wait, let me double-check the earlier steps.

We had point C on both AB and the envelope. So, the point C must satisfy both the parametric equations of AB and the envelope.

But perhaps there's a better approach. Maybe instead of parametrizing the envelope, consider that point C lies on AB and on exactly one PQ, which is AB itself. So, the tangent to the envelope at point C is AB. Hmm, maybe not.

Alternatively, since point C is on AB, perhaps the line AB is tangent to the envelope of the family F. That is, the envelope is a curve, and AB is tangent to this curve at point C.

If that's the case, then point C is the point of tangency, so the line AB is tangent to the envelope curve at C.

So, perhaps the envelope is a curve, and AB is tangent to it at point C.

So, the condition is that AB is tangent to the envelope at C.

So, to find point C on AB where AB is tangent to the envelope of F.

Alternatively, the envelope is the set of points where each point is on exactly one PQ. So, if AB is tangent to the envelope at C, then C is the only intersection point between AB and the envelope.

So, perhaps we can find the point C where AB is tangent to the envelope, which would imply that the system of equations (equation of AB and envelope) has exactly one solution, which is C.

Alternatively, parametrize AB as point C and substitute into envelope equations, then set up the condition for tangency.

But perhaps this is getting too abstract.

Wait, maybe I can use the parametrization of AB and substitute into the envelope equations.

AB is parametrized as x = (1 - t)/2, y = (sqrt(3)/2) t.

The envelope is given by x = p^3, y = (1 - p²)^(3/2).

So, if point C is on both, then:

(1 - t)/2 = p^3,

sqrt(3)/2 t = (1 - p²)^(3/2).

We can solve for t from the first equation:

t = 1 - 2 p^3.

Substitute into the second equation:

sqrt(3)/2 (1 - 2 p^3) = (1 - p²)^(3/2).

Square both sides:

3/4 (1 - 2 p^3)^2 = (1 - p²)^3.

Which is the same equation as before, leading to 16 p^6 -12 p^4 -12 p^3 +12 p^2 -1 =0.

We found that p=1/2 is a root, so let's factor it out.

Using synthetic division for polynomial 16 p^6 -12 p^4 -12 p^3 +12 p^2 -1, divided by (p - 1/2).

But synthetic division for a 6th-degree polynomial is tedious. Alternatively, since p=1/2 is a root, the polynomial can be written as (p - 1/2)(something).

Let me perform the division step by step.

Let me write the polynomial as:

16 p^6 + 0 p^5 -12 p^4 -12 p^3 +12 p^2 +0 p -1.

We'll divide by (p - 1/2). Using synthetic division:

Set up coefficients: 16, 0, -12, -12, 12, 0, -1.

Root: p = 1/2.

Bring down 16.

Multiply by 1/2: 8.

Add to next coefficient: 0 +8=8.

Multiply by 1/2:4.

Add to next coefficient: -12 +4= -8.

Multiply by 1/2: -4.

Add to next coefficient: -12 + (-4)= -16.

Multiply by 1/2: -8.

Add to next coefficient:12 + (-8)=4.

Multiply by 1/2: 2.

Add to next coefficient:0 +2=2.

Multiply by 1/2:1.

Add to last coefficient: -1 +1=0. Perfect.

So, the quotient polynomial is:

16 p^5 +8 p^4 -8 p^3 -16 p^2 +4 p +2.

So, now the equation becomes:

(p - 1/2)(16 p^5 +8 p^4 -8 p^3 -16 p^2 +4 p +2)=0.

So, besides p=1/2, the other roots are the roots of 16 p^5 +8 p^4 -8 p^3 -16 p^2 +4 p +2=0.

Hmm, a fifth-degree equation. That's still difficult, but perhaps there's a rational root.

Using Rational Root Theorem: possible roots are ±1, ±2, ±1/2, ±1/4, etc., over divisors of 16.

Testing p= -1:

16*(-1)^5 +8*(-1)^4 -8*(-1)^3 -16*(-1)^2 +4*(-1) +2 =

-16 +8 +8 -16 -4 +2= (-16+8)= -8; (-8 +8)=0; (0-16)= -16; (-16-4)= -20; (-20 +2)= -18≠0.

p=1:

16 +8 -8 -16 +4 +2= (16+8)=24; (24-8)=16; (16-16)=0; (0+4)=4; (4+2)=6≠0.

p=1/2:

16*(1/32) +8*(1/16) -8*(1/8) -16*(1/4) +4*(1/2) +2.

= 0.5 +0.5 -1 -4 +2 +2.

= (0.5+0.5)=1; (1-1)=0; (0-4)= -4; (-4+2)= -2; (-2+2)=0.

So, p=1/2 is also a root of the quintic.

So, we can factor out another (p -1/2).

Using synthetic division again on the quintic:

16 p^5 +8 p^4 -8 p^3 -16 p^2 +4 p +2.

Divide by (p -1/2).

Coefficients:16,8,-8,-16,4,2.

Bring down 16.

Multiply by1/2:8.

Add to next:8+8=16.

Multiply by1/2:8.

Add to next: -8 +8=0.

Multiply by1/2:0.

Add to next:-16 +0=-16.

Multiply by1/2:-8.

Add to next:4 + (-8)= -4.

Multiply by1/2:-2.

Add to next:2 + (-2)=0.

So, the quotient polynomial is:

16 p^4 +16 p^3 +0 p^2 -16 p -4.

So, the equation now is:

(p -1/2)^2 (16 p^4 +16 p^3 -16 p -4)=0.

We can factor out 4 from the quartic:

4(4 p^4 +4 p^3 -4 p -1)=0.

So, 4 p^4 +4 p^3 -4 p -1=0.

Let me see if this quartic can be factored.

Try grouping terms:

4 p^4 +4 p^3 -4 p -1 = (4 p^4 +4 p^3) + (-4 p -1) = 4 p^3(p +1) - (4 p +1).

Hmm, doesn't seem helpful.

Alternatively, perhaps factor as (ap^2 + bp + c)(dp^2 + ep +f).

Assume it factors into two quadratics:

( a p^2 + b p + c ) ( d p^2 + e p + f ) = 4 p^4 +4 p^3 -4 p -1.

Expanding:

a d p^4 + (a e + b d) p^3 + (a f + b e + c d) p^2 + (b f + c e) p + c f.

Set coefficients equal:

a d =4,

a e + b d =4,

a f + b e + c d =0,

b f +c e =-4,

c f =-1.

We need to find integers a,b,c,d,e,f such that these hold.

Looking at c f = -1. So, possible pairs (c,f) are (1,-1), (-1,1).

Try c=1, f=-1.

Then, from b f +c e =-4: b*(-1) +1*e = -4 → -b + e = -4 → e = b -4.

From a d =4. Let's try a=2, d=2.

Then, a e + b d =4 → 2 e + 2 b =4 → e +b =2.

But e =b -4. So,

b -4 +b =2 → 2b=6 →b=3.

Then e=3-4=-1.

Now, check a f + b e + c d = 2*(-1) +3*(-1) +1*2= -2 -3 +2= -3≠0.

Not matching. So discard.

Try c=-1, f=1.

Then, from b f + c e =-4: b*1 + (-1)*e =-4 → b -e = -4 → e = b +4.

From a d =4. Let's again try a=2, d=2.

Then, a e +b d =4: 2 e +2 b=4 → e +b=2.

But e = b +4. So,

b +4 + b=2 → 2b= -2 →b=-1.

Then e= -1 +4=3.

Now, a f + b e +c d = 2*1 + (-1)*3 + (-1)*2= 2 -3 -2= -3 ≠0.

Doesn't work.

Try a=4, d=1.

Then, a e +b d=4 e +b*1=4.

But e= b +4. So,

4(b +4) +b=4 →4b +16 +b=4 →5b= -12 →b= -12/5. Not integer, skip.

Alternatively, a=1, d=4.

Then, a e +b d = e +4b=4.

With e= b +4,

e +4b= b +4 +4b=5b +4=4 →5b=0→b=0.

Then e=0+4=4.

Check a f +b e +c d=1*1 +0*4 + (-1)*4=1 +0 -4= -3≠0.

Not good.

Another approach: perhaps the quartic is a biquadratic or can be transformed.

Alternatively, perhaps make substitution z = p + something.

Alternatively, try rational roots.

Possible roots for quartic 4p^4 +4 p^3 -4 p -1=0.

Possible rational roots are ±1, ±1/2, ±1/4.

Test p=1:

4 +4 -4 -1=3≠0.

p=-1:

4*(-1)^4 +4*(-1)^3 -4*(-1) -1=4 -4 +4 -1=3≠0.

p=1/2:

4*(1/16) +4*(1/8) -4*(1/2) -1= 0.25 +0.5 -2 -1= -2.25≠0.

p= -1/2:

4*(1/16) +4*(-1/8) -4*(-1/2) -1= 0.25 -0.5 +2 -1=0.75≠0.

p=1/4:

4*(1/256) +4*(1/64) -4*(1/4) -1= (1/64)+(1/16)-1-1= (1/64 +4/64)=5/64≈0.078; 0.078 -2= -1.922≠0.

p= -1/4:

4*(1/256) +4*(-1/64) -4*(-1/4) -1= (1/64) - (1/16) +1 -1= (1/64 -4/64)= -3/64≈-0.046875≠0.

So, no rational roots. So, perhaps the quartic is irreducible over rationals. Which means the only real roots we can find are p=1/2 (double root), and perhaps others.

But since we're dealing with the envelope, which is a curve in the first quadrant, p must be between 0 and1.

We have p=1/2 is a root, which is the point AB itself. So, perhaps the other real roots are outside our interval or maybe another point.

But we're looking for a point C on AB that's not on any other PQ, so we need another solution where p≠1/2. So, perhaps the quartic has another real root in (0,1).

Let me check the quartic 4 p^4 +4 p^3 -4 p -1 at p=0: 0 +0 -0 -1= -1.

At p=1:4 +4 -4 -1=3.

So, by Intermediate Value Theorem, there's a root between 0 and1.

Similarly, at p=0.5: 4*(1/16)+4*(1/8)-4*(1/2)-1=0.25+0.5-2-1= -2.25.

At p=0.75: 4*(0.75)^4 +4*(0.75)^3 -4*(0.75)-1.

Compute (0.75)^2=0.5625; (0.75)^3=0.421875; (0.75)^4≈0.31640625.

So,

4*0.31640625≈1.265625,

4*0.421875≈1.6875,

-4*0.75= -3,

-1.

Total≈1.265625 +1.6875=2.953125; 2.953125 -3= -0.046875; -0.046875 -1= -1.046875.

Wait, that can't be right because at p=1, the value is 3.

Wait, let me compute at p=0.75:

4*(0.75)^4=4*(0.31640625)=1.265625,

+4*(0.75)^3=4*(0.421875)=1.6875,

+ (-4)*(0.75)= -3,

-1.

So sum: 1.265625 +1.6875=2.953125; 2.953125 -3= -0.046875; -0.046875 -1= -1.046875.

Wait, that's less than zero, but at p=1, the value is 3. So, the function crosses from negative to positive between p=0.75 and p=1.

Similarly, let's check at p=0.9:

4*(0.9)^4≈4*(0.6561)=2.6244,

+4*(0.9)^3≈4*(0.729)=2.916,

-4*(0.9)= -3.6,

-1.

Sum: 2.6244 +2.916=5.5404; 5.5404 -3.6=1.9404; 1.9404 -1=0.9404>0.

So, root between 0.75 and 0.9.

At p=0.8:

4*(0.8)^4=4*(0.4096)=1.6384,

+4*(0.8)^3=4*(0.512)=2.048,

-4*(0.8)= -3.2,

-1.

Sum:1.6384 +2.048=3.6864; 3.6864 -3.2=0.4864; 0.4864 -1= -0.5136<0.

At p=0.85:

4*(0.85)^4≈4*(0.52200625)=2.088025,

+4*(0.85)^3≈4*(0.614125)=2.4565,

-4*(0.85)= -3.4,

-1.

Sum≈2.088025 +2.4565≈4.5445; 4.5445 -3.4≈1.1445; 1.1445 -1≈0.1445>0.

So, root between 0.8 and0.85.

At p=0.825:

4*(0.825)^4≈4*(0.825^2)^2. 0.825^2≈0.6806; then squared≈0.4632. So 4*0.4632≈1.8528.

4*(0.825)^3≈4*(0.5615)≈2.246.

-4*(0.825)= -3.3.

-1.

Sum≈1.8528 +2.246≈4.0988; 4.0988 -3.3≈0.7988; 0.7988 -1≈-0.2012<0.

So, p=0.825 gives -0.2012, p=0.85 gives 0.1445.

So, using linear approximation:

Between p=0.825 (-0.2012) and p=0.85 (0.1445). The change is 0.0487 over 0.025.

To reach zero from -0.2012, need delta p: (0.2012 / (0.0487/0.025)) ≈ (0.2012 /1.948)≈0.1032.

So, p≈0.825 +0.1032*0.025≈0.825 +0.0026≈0.8276.

But perhaps it's better to use a better approximation method, like Newton-Raphson.

Let me take p0=0.85, f(p)=4p^4 +4p^3 -4p -1.

f(0.85)=≈0.1445.

f'(p)=16 p^3 +12 p^2 -4.

At p=0.85, f'(0.85)=16*(0.85)^3 +12*(0.85)^2 -4.

Compute (0.85)^2≈0.7225; (0.85)^3≈0.6141.

So f'≈16*0.6141≈9.8256 +12*0.7225≈8.67 → total≈9.8256+8.67≈18.4956 -4=14.4956.

Then, Newton-Raphson step: p1 = p0 - f(p0)/f'(p0).

p1≈0.85 - (0.1445)/14.4956≈0.85 -0.00997≈0.84003.

Compute f(0.84):

4*(0.84)^4 +4*(0.84)^3 -4*(0.84) -1.

(0.84)^2=0.7056,

(0.84)^3=0.7056*0.84≈0.5927,

(0.84)^4≈0.5927*0.84≈0.4978.

So,

4*0.4978≈1.991,

+4*0.5927≈2.3708,

-4*0.84≈-3.36,

-1.

Sum≈1.991 +2.3708≈4.3618; 4.3618 -3.36≈1.0018; 1.0018 -1≈0.0018≈0.002.

So f(0.84)=≈0.002.

f'(0.84)=16*(0.84)^3 +12*(0.84)^2 -4≈16*0.5927≈9.4832 +12*0.7056≈8.4672 → total≈17.9504 -4=13.9504.

Next step:

p2=0.84 - (0.002)/13.9504≈0.84 -0.000143≈0.839857.

Compute f(0.839857):

Approximately, since it's very close to 0.84, f≈0.002.

But we can stop here as it's sufficiently close.

So, the quartic has a root near p≈0.8399.

So, in our original problem, the point C is at p=1/2 and another p≈0.8399.

But since we're looking for a point on AB that is not on any other PQ, it must correspond to p=1/2. But wait, that's the point AB itself.

Wait, but the problem states that there is a unique point C on AB, distinct from A and B, that does not belong to any segment from F other than AB. So, perhaps C is the other intersection point where the envelope meets AB, which is at p≈0.8399.

So, C is on AB and on the envelope at p≈0.8399. So, the coordinates of C are x=p^3, y=(1 -p²)^(3/2) with p≈0.8399.

Alternatively, since we have p≈0.8399, we can compute x and y.

But perhaps we can find an exact expression.

Wait, but the quartic equation is 4 p^4 +4 p^3 -4 p -1=0.

Let me try to find an exact solution.

Let me set q = p + something. Maybe make substitution to reduce the quartic.

Alternatively, perhaps factor it as (2 p^2 + a p + b)(2 p^2 + c p + d) =4 p^4 +4 p^3 -4 p -1.

Expanding:

4 p^4 + (2c + 2a) p^3 + (ac + 2d + 2b) p^2 + (ad + bc) p + b d.

Set equal to 4 p^4 +4 p^3 +0 p^2 -4 p -1.

So,

Equate coefficients:

4 p^4: same.

p^3: 2c + 2a=4 → c +a=2.

p^2: a c + 2d +2b=0.

p: a d +b c= -4.

constant term: b d= -1.

We need integers a,b,c,d satisfying these equations.

From b d= -1.

Possible (b,d)= (1,-1), (-1,1).

Try (b,d)=(1,-1).

Then, from a d +b c= -4:

a*(-1) +1*c= -4 → -a +c= -4.

From c +a=2.

So,

c=2 -a.

Substitute into -a +c= -4:

-a + (2 -a) = -4 → -2a +2= -4 → -2a= -6 → a=3.

Then, c=2 -3= -1.

Now, check p^2 term equation: a c +2d +2b=3*(-1) +2*(-1) +2*1= -3 -2 +2= -3≠0.

Doesn't work.

Try (b,d)= (-1,1).

Then, a d +b c= a*1 + (-1)*c= -4 →a -c= -4.

From c +a=2.

So,

c=2 -a.

Substitute into a - (2 -a)= -4 → a -2 +a= -4 → 2a= -2 → a= -1.

Then, c=2 - (-1)=3.

Check p^2 term: a c +2d +2b= (-1)*3 +2*1 +2*(-1)= -3 +2 -2= -3≠0.

Doesn't work.

So, no factorization with integer coefficients. So perhaps the quartic is irreducible, and we need to use substitution.

Alternatively, perhaps make substitution z = p + 1/p or something else, but that might complicate.

Alternatively, perhaps let me consider that the quartic equation 4 p^4 +4 p^3 -4 p -1=0 can be rewritten as:

4 p^4 -4 p +4 p^3 -1=0.

Factor:

4 p^4 -4 p +4 p^3 -1=0.

Group as (4 p^4 +4 p^3) + (-4 p -1)=0.

Factor:

4 p^3 (p +1) - (4 p +1)=0.

Hmm, doesn't help.

Alternatively, perhaps factor as p^3 (4 p +4) - (4 p +1)=0.

No, not helpful.

Alternatively, perhaps factor as (2 p^2 + a p + b)(2 p^2 + c p + d)=4 p^4 + ... as before.

Wait, perhaps non-integer coefficients.

Alternatively, perhaps use substitution t = p + k, but might not help.

Alternatively, perhaps use the depressed quartic formula, but that's complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps accept that the exact solution is messy and proceed numerically.

Wait, but maybe we can find an exact solution using trigonometric substitution.

Alternatively, perhaps this quartic is a quadratic in terms of p^2.

Wait, 4 p^4 +4 p^3 -4 p -1=0.

It's not a biquadratic, but perhaps if I let u = p + something.

Alternatively, perhaps let u = p + 1/(2 p), but not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps use substitution t = p - 1/(2 p).

Wait, not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps let me consider the quartic equation:

4 p^4 +4 p^3 -4 p -1=0.

I can divide both sides by p^2:

4 p^2 +4 p -4/p -1/p^2=0.

Let me set z = p - 1/p.

Then, z^2 = p^2 - 2 +1/p^2.

So, p^2 +1/p^2= z^2 +2.

Similarly, p -1/p = z.

But our equation is 4 p^2 +4 p -4/p -1/p^2=0.

Express in terms of z:

4 (p^2 -1/p^2) +4 (p -1/p) =0.

Which is 4 (p^2 -1/p^2) +4 z=0.

But p^2 -1/p^2=(p -1/p)(p +1/p)=z (p +1/p).

So,

4 z (p +1/p) +4 z=0.

Factor 4 z:

4 z (p +1/p +1)=0.

So, either z=0 or p +1/p +1=0.

If z=0, then p -1/p=0→p=±1. But p is between 0 and1, so p=1 is a solution. But plugging p=1 into the quartic:4+4-4-1=3≠0. So, z=0 is not a solution.

Alternatively, p +1/p +1=0.

Since p>0, p +1/p +1=0 is impossible.

Hmm, that approach didn't help.

Wait, perhaps I made an error in substitution.

Wait, original equation after dividing by p^2:

4 p^2 +4 p -4/p -1/p^2=0.

Let me group as 4 p^2 -1/p^2 +4 p -4/p=0.

Factor:

(2 p -1/p)(2 p +1/p) +4 (p -1/p)=0.

Let me set z = p -1/p.

Then, (2 p -1/p)=2 p -1/p, and (2 p +1/p).

Hmm, (2p -1/p)(2p +1/p)=4 p^2 +2 p*(1/p) -2 p*(1/p) -1/p^2=4 p^2 +2 -2 -1/p^2=4 p^2 -1/p^2.

Which is the first part.

So,

(2p -1/p)(2p +1/p) +4 z=0.

But 4 z=4(p -1/p).

So,

(4 p^2 -1/p^2) +4 (p -1/p)=0.

Which is our equation.

But I'm going in circles here.

Alternatively, perhaps let me set t = p + 1/p.

But not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps give up and accept that we can't find an exact solution, so proceed with the approximate value p≈0.84.

So, p≈0.84, then x=p^3≈0.5927.

y=(1 -p²)^(3/2).

Compute p²≈0.7056.

1-p²≈0.2944.

sqrt(0.2944)=≈0.5425.

So, y≈(0.5425)^3≈0.159.

So, point C is approximately (0.5927, 0.159).

But AB is the line from (0.5,0) to (0, sqrt(3)/2≈0.866).

So, the point C we found is not on AB? Wait, no, because we found it as the intersection point.

Wait, no. Wait, AB is parametrized as x=(1-t)/2, y=(sqrt(3)/2)t.

So, when p≈0.84, t=1 -2 p^3≈1 -2*(0.5927)=1 -1.1854≈-0.1854, which is negative, t<0, which is outside AB's parameterization.

Hmm, that's a problem. Because t must be between 0 and1 for point C to be on AB.

Wait, that suggests that the quartic root p≈0.84 corresponds to t negative, which is outside AB.

But since AB is from t=0 to t=1, we need t∈[0,1]. So, perhaps the only solution within t∈[0,1] is p=1/2, which is point AB itself.

But the problem states that there's a unique point C on AB, other than A and B, that is not on any other PQ. So, perhaps C is at p=1/2, but that's AB itself, which is already in F.

Wait, this is getting confusing. Alternatively, perhaps the only point on AB not lying on any other PQ is the midpoint?

Wait, but AB is itself a PQ in F, so points on AB are on AB, but we need a point C on AB that's not on any other PQ.

So, perhaps the only such point is the midpoint of AB.

Wait, the midpoint of AB is at ((1/2 +0)/2, (0 + sqrt(3)/2)/2)= (1/4, sqrt(3)/4).

Compute OC²= (1/4)^2 + (sqrt(3)/4)^2= 1/16 +3/16=4/16=1/4. So OC²=1/4, p=1, q=4, p+q=5.

But the problem says that C is on AB, distinct from A and B, unique, not lying on any other PQ.

But if C is the midpoint, does it lie on any other PQ?

Wait, let me check. Suppose C=(1/4, sqrt(3)/4). Is there a PQ (for some p≠1/2) that passes through C?

So, PQ is x/p + y/q=1, where q= sqrt(1 -p²).

So, plug in x=1/4, y=sqrt(3)/4:

(1/4)/p + (sqrt(3)/4)/sqrt(1 -p²)=1.

Multiply both sides by 4:

(1)/p + (sqrt(3))/sqrt(1 -p²)=4.

Let me denote u = p.

Then,

1/u + sqrt(3)/sqrt(1 -u²) =4.

Let me square both sides:

(1/u²) + 2*(1/u)*(sqrt(3)/sqrt(1 -u²)) + 3/(1 -u²)=16.

Hmm, complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps try to solve numerically.

Let me denote f(u)=1/u + sqrt(3)/sqrt(1 -u²) -4.

We need to find u in (0,1) such that f(u)=0.

Compute f(0.5)=2 + sqrt(3)/sqrt(3/4) -4=2 + sqrt(3)/(sqrt(3)/2)=2 + 2 -4=0. So, u=0.5 is a solution.

But we need another solution.

Compute f(0.25)=4 + sqrt(3)/sqrt(3/4)=4 + 2=6>0.

f(0.75)=1.333 + sqrt(3)/sqrt(1 -0.75²)=1.333 + sqrt(3)/sqrt(1 -0.5625)=1.333 + sqrt(3)/sqrt(0.4375).

sqrt(0.4375)=≈0.6614.

sqrt(3)=≈1.732.

So, 1.732/0.6614≈2.618.

So, f(0.75)=≈1.333 +2.618≈3.951>4? No, 1.333+2.618≈3.951, which is less than 4. So, f(0.75)=≈3.951-4≈-0.049<0.

So, f(0.75)≈-0.049.

f(0.7):

1/0.7≈1.4286,

sqrt(3)/sqrt(1 -0.49)=sqrt(3)/sqrt(0.51)=≈1.732/0.7141≈2.425.

So, f(0.7)=1.4286 +2.425≈3.8536-4≈-0.1464<0.

f(0.6):

1/0.6≈1.6667,

sqrt(3)/sqrt(1 -0.36)=sqrt(3)/sqrt(0.64)=≈1.732/0.8≈2.165.

f(0.6)=1.6667 +2.165≈3.8317-4≈-0.1683<0.

f(0.4):

1/0.4=2.5,

sqrt(3)/sqrt(1 -0.16)=sqrt(3)/sqrt(0.84)=≈1.732/0.9165≈1.89.

f(0.4)=2.5 +1.89≈4.39 -4=0.39>0.

So, f(0.4)=0.39, f(0.5)=0, f(0.6)= -0.1683.

So, another root between 0.5 and0.6.

Wait, but earlier we saw that p=0.5 is already a solution (AB itself). So, does that mean that the midpoint is on another PQ? But no, because at u=0.5, it's AB.

Wait, but according to this, f(u)=0 at u=0.5 and another point between 0.4 and0.5.

Wait, but when u=0.4, f(u)=0.39, u=0.5, f(u)=0.

So, the only solution in (0,1) is u=0.5.

Wait, that can't be right because when we computed f(0.75), it was negative, and f(0.4) was positive, implying another solution between 0.4 and0.5.

Wait, but when u approaches 1, f(u) tends to infinity, since 1/u tends to 1, and sqrt(3)/sqrt(1 -u²) tends to infinity.

So, f(u) starts at +infty at u approaching 0, decreases, crosses zero at u=0.5, then goes to negative, reaches a minimum, then increases to +infty as u approaches1.

Wait, but from u=0.5, f(u)=0, and at u=0.6, f(u)=≈-0.1683, and at u=0.75, f(u)=≈-0.049, and at u=0.8, f(u)=≈-0.2012, but earlier calculation may be incorrect.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in f(0.75).

Wait, f(u)=1/u + sqrt(3)/sqrt(1 -u²) -4.

At u=0.75:

1/u=1.3333,

sqrt(3)/sqrt(1 -0.75²)=sqrt(3)/sqrt(1 -0.5625)=sqrt(3)/sqrt(0.4375)=≈1.732/0.6614≈2.618.

So, f(0.75)=1.3333 +2.618≈3.9513 -4≈-0.0487.

At u=0.8:

1/u=1.25,

sqrt(3)/sqrt(1 -0.64)=sqrt(3)/sqrt(0.36)=sqrt(3)/0.6≈2.8868.

So, f(0.8)=1.25 +2.8868≈4.1368 -4≈0.1368>0.

So, f(0.8)=≈0.1368>0.

So, f(u) crosses zero between u=0.75 (f≈-0.0487) and u=0.8 (f≈0.1368). So, another root between 0.75 and0.8.

So, the equation f(u)=0 has two roots: u=0.5 and another between 0.75 and0.8.

So, when u=0.5, it's AB itself. The other root is another PQ that passes through C.

Wait, but this suggests that the midpoint C=(1/4, sqrt(3)/4) lies on another PQ. So, perhaps that's not the unique point.

Wait, this is getting too tangled. Maybe the unique point C is the point where AB is tangent to the envelope, which would mean that the system has exactly one solution, which is AB itself.

But earlier, when we set up the equations, we found that the envelope intersects AB at p=1/2 (point AB itself) and another point p≈0.84, which is outside AB's parameterization.

Wait, but in our earlier substitution, when p≈0.84, we found t≈-0.1854, which is outside AB's t∈[0,1].

So, perhaps the only intersection point within AB is p=1/2, which is AB itself. So, the point C is the point where AB is tangent to the envelope. Thus, the only point on AB that is on exactly one PQ (which is AB itself) is the point of tangency.

So, to find this point, perhaps the system has a double root, meaning that the quartic equation has a double root at p=1/2, but earlier we saw that p=1/2 is a root with multiplicity 2.

Wait, but when we divided the original polynomial by (p -1/2)^2, we got a quartic, so p=1/2 is a double root.

Thus, the envelope touches AB at p=1/2, which is point AB itself, but since AB is in F, the only point on AB that's not on any other PQ is the point where AB is tangent to the envelope, which is the double root.

But this seems conflicting.

Alternatively, perhaps the only point on AB not lying on any other PQ is the point where the envelope is tangent to AB, which is at p=1/2.

But that's the entire AB segment, which is in F.

Wait, but the problem states that C is on AB, distinct from A and B, unique, not on any other PQ. So, perhaps the midpoint is the unique point.

But earlier, we saw that the midpoint lies on another PQ.

Wait, perhaps the point C is such that the line PQ is tangent to the envelope at C, so that C is the only intersection point between AB and the envelope.

In that case, the quartic equation would have a double root at p=1/2, which is already the case.

But I'm getting confused. Maybe a better approach is to parametrize the problem differently.

Alternatively, perhaps consider the coordinates of point C on AB: ( (1 - t)/2, (sqrt(3)/2 ) t ).

We need that the line PQ from (p,0) to (0, sqrt(1 -p²)) passes through C only when p=1/2.

So, for all other p≠1/2, the equation ( (1 -t)/2 ) / p + ( (sqrt(3)/2 ) t ) / sqrt(1 -p²) ≠1.

So, for each t ∈ [0,1], the equation can be written as:

(1 -t)/(2p) + (sqrt(3) t)/(2 sqrt(1 -p²)) =1.

But this is the equation of PQ passing through C.

We need that this equation has no solution for p≠1/2.

Alternatively, for each t, there's exactly one p (which is 1/2) such that the equation holds.

Which implies that the function f(p) = (1 -t)/(2p) + (sqrt(3) t)/(2 sqrt(1 -p²)) is equal to 1 only when p=1/2.

So, for each t, f(p) =1 has only one solution p=1/2.

Which would imply that f(p) is tangent to 1 at p=1/2.

So, the derivative of f(p) at p=1/2 must be zero.

Compute f(p)= (1 -t)/(2p) + (sqrt(3) t)/(2 sqrt(1 -p²)).

Compute f'(p)= - (1 -t)/(2p²) + (sqrt(3) t)/(2) * (p)/( (1 -p²)^(3/2) ).

At p=1/2:

f'(1/2)= - (1 -t)/(2*(1/2)^2) + (sqrt(3) t)/2 * (1/2)/( (1 - (1/2)^2 )^(3/2) )

Simplify:

Denominator for first term: 2*(1/4)=1/2.

So, first term: - (1 -t)/(1/2) = -2(1 -t).

Second term: numerator sqrt(3) t /2 * 1/2 = sqrt(3) t /4.

Denominator: (sqrt(3)/2)^(3/2). Wait, sqrt(1 - (1/2)^2)=sqrt(3/4)=sqrt(3)/2.

So, (sqrt(3)/2)^(3/2)= (3^(1/2)/2)^(3/2)=3^(3/4)/2^(3/2)= 3^(3/4)/(2*sqrt(2)).

So, second term:

[ sqrt(3) t /4 ] / [ 3^(3/4)/(2 sqrt(2)) ) ] = [ sqrt(3) t /4 ] * [ 2 sqrt(2) / 3^(3/4) ) ].

Simplify:

= [ sqrt(3) * 2 sqrt(2) * t ] / (4 * 3^(3/4)) )

= [ 2 sqrt(6) t ] / (4 * 3^(3/4) )

= [ sqrt(6) t ] / (2 * 3^(3/4) )

Now, 3^(3/4)= (3^(1/4))^3.

But perhaps we can write it as 3^(3/4)=3^(1/2 +1/4)= sqrt(3) * 3^(1/4).

So,

sqrt(6)/ (2 * 3^(3/4)) = sqrt(6)/(2 * 3^(3/4)) = sqrt(6)/(2 * 3^(3/4)).

But sqrt(6)=sqrt(2*3)=sqrt(2)*sqrt(3).

Thus,

sqrt(6)/(2 * 3^(3/4))= sqrt(2)*sqrt(3)/(2 *3^(3/4))= sqrt(2)/(2) * 3^(1/2 -3/4)= sqrt(2)/2 * 3^(-1/4)= (sqrt(2)/2) / 3^(1/4).

So, second term is [ sqrt(2)/(2 * 3^(1/4)) ] * t.

So, putting it all together, f'(1/2)= -2(1 -t) + [ sqrt(2)/(2 * 3^(1/4)) ] t.

We set this derivative to zero:

-2(1 -t) + [ sqrt(2)/(2 * 3^(1/4)) ] t =0.

Solve for t:

-2 + 2 t + [ sqrt(2)/(2 * 3^(1/4)) ] t=0.

Factor t:

t [ 2 + sqrt(2)/(2 * 3^(1/4)) ] =2.

So,

t= 2 / [ 2 + sqrt(2)/(2 * 3^(1/4)) ].

This gives t in terms of radicals, which is complicated. But perhaps rationalizing or finding a common denominator.

Alternatively, let me denote a=3^(1/4), so a²= sqrt(3).

Then,

t= 2 / [ 2 + sqrt(2)/(2 a) ].

Multiply numerator and denominator by 2a:

t= (4a) / [4a + sqrt(2)].

Multiply numerator and denominator by (4a - sqrt(2)) to rationalize:

t= [4a (4a - sqrt(2)) ] / [ (4a + sqrt(2))(4a - sqrt(2)) ].

Denominator: (4a)^2 - (sqrt(2))^2=16 a² -2.

But a²=sqrt(3), so denominator=16 sqrt(3) -2.

Numerator: 16 a² -4a sqrt(2)=16 sqrt(3) -4a sqrt(2).

Thus,

t= [16 sqrt(3) -4a sqrt(2) ] / (16 sqrt(3) -2 ).

Factor numerator and denominator:

Factor numerator: 4 [4 sqrt(3) -a sqrt(2)].

Denominator: 2 [8 sqrt(3) -1 ].

So,

t= [4 (4 sqrt(3) -a sqrt(2)) ] / [2 (8 sqrt(3)-1) ]= [2 (4 sqrt(3) -a sqrt(2)) ] / (8 sqrt(3)-1 ).

But a=3^(1/4), so this is still complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps accept the complexity and proceed.

Now, with t found, point C is:

x=(1 -t)/2,

y= (sqrt(3)/2) t.

So, OC²= x² + y²= [ (1 -t)/2 ]² + [ (sqrt(3)/2 t ]².

Compute:

= (1 -2t +t²)/4 + (3 t²)/4

= [1 -2t + t² +3 t² ] /4

= [1 -2t +4 t² ] /4.

So, OC²= (4 t² -2 t +1)/4.

Now, substitute t= 2 / [ 2 + sqrt(2)/(2 * 3^(1/4)) ].

But this seems too messy. Perhaps instead of trying to find an exact expression, think differently.

Alternatively, perhaps use the fact that when AB is tangent to the envelope, the point C is where AB is tangent to the envelope, so the coordinates of C can be found by the parametrization of the envelope.

Earlier, we had the envelope parametrized as x=p³, y=(1 -p²)^(3/2).

And AB is parametrized as x=(1 -t)/2, y= (sqrt(3)/2) t.

At the point of tangency, these two must be equal, and their derivatives must match.

So, equate x and y:

p³ = (1 -t)/2,

(1 -p²)^(3/2) = (sqrt(3)/2) t.

Also, the derivatives dx/dp and dy/dp for the envelope must equal dx/dt and dy/dt for AB.

Compute derivatives:

For envelope:

dx/dp=3 p²,

dy/dp= (3/2)(1 -p²)^(1/2)*(-2p)= -3 p (1 -p²)^(1/2).

For AB:

dx/dt= -1/2,

dy/dt= sqrt(3)/2.

So, at point C:

3 p² = -1/2,

which is impossible because p>0 and 3 p² cannot be negative.

Wait, that can't be right. So, perhaps I made a mistake in the derivatives.

Wait, for the envelope, the parametrization is x=p³, y=(1 -p²)^(3/2).

So,

dx/dp=3 p²,

dy/dp= (3/2)(1 -p²)^(1/2)*(-2p)= -3 p (1 -p²)^(1/2).

For AB, parametrized as x=(1 -t)/2, y= (sqrt(3)/2) t,

dx/dt= -1/2,

dy/dt= sqrt(3)/2.

At point C, the slopes must be equal.

So, dy/dx for envelope is (dy/dp)/(dx/dp)= [ -3 p (1 -p²)^(1/2) ] / (3 p² )= - (1 -p²)^(1/2)/p.

For AB, dy/dx is (dy/dt)/(dx/dt)= [ sqrt(3)/2 ] / [ -1/2 ]= -sqrt(3).

So,

- (1 -p²)^(1/2)/p = -sqrt(3).

Simplify:

(1 -p²)^(1/2)/p = sqrt(3).

Square both sides:

(1 -p²)/p² =3.

So,

1 -p²=3 p²,

1=4 p²,

p²=1/4,

p=1/2.

So, p=1/2, which is AB itself.

So, the only point where the envelope and AB have the same slope is at p=1/2, which is AB.

But the problem says there's a unique point C on AB, other than A and B, that's not on any other PQ.

So, perhaps C is at p=1/2, but that's AB itself, so perhaps the point is the midpoint.

But earlier, we saw that the midpoint lies on another PQ, which contradicts the problem statement.

Wait, but perhaps the only point on AB that is not on any other PQ is the midpoint, as it's the only point where the envelope is tangent, but the envelope is just AB itself.

Hmm, I'm getting stuck here.

Alternatively, perhaps the point C is the point where the line AB is tangent to the envelope, which would be at p=1/2, which is AB itself. But then, all points on AB are on AB, which is in F, so the only point not on any other PQ is nowhere, which can't be.

Alternatively, perhaps the point C is where the line AB intersects the envelope at exactly one point, which is the case when AB is tangent to the envelope. So, the only such point is p=1/2, which is AB itself.

But then, the problem states that C is on AB, distinct from A and B, that's not on any other PQ. So, perhaps C is the point where AB is tangent to the envelope, which is at the midpoint.

But earlier, we saw that the midpoint lies on another PQ. So, maybe I made a mistake there.

Wait, when I plugged in the midpoint into the equation for another PQ, I found that u=0.5 is a solution, but perhaps that's only AB itself.

Wait, let me check again. Suppose I have point C=(1/4, sqrt(3)/4).

Is there a PQ other than AB that passes through C?

So, suppose there exists a p≠1/2 such that (1/4)/p + (sqrt(3)/4)/sqrt(1 -p²)=1.

Let me denote this equation as:

(1)/(4p) + (sqrt(3))/(4 sqrt(1 -p²))=1.

Multiply both sides by 4:

1/p + sqrt(3)/sqrt(1 -p²)=4.

Let me denote u=p.

So,

1/u + sqrt(3)/sqrt(1 -u²)=4.

We can square both sides:

1/u² + 2*(1/u)*(sqrt(3)/sqrt(1 -u²)) + 3/(1 -u²)=16.

But this seems complicated. Alternatively, perhaps we can find u such that this holds.

Let me try u=1/2, which is AB.

1/(1/2) + sqrt(3)/sqrt(1 - (1/2)^2)=2 + sqrt(3)/(sqrt(3)/2)=2 + 2=4. So, yes, u=1/2 is a solution.

Now, let's see if there's another solution.

Let me try u= sqrt(3)/3≈0.577.

So, 1/u≈1.732,

sqrt(3)/sqrt(1 - (1/3))=sqrt(3)/sqrt(2/3)=sqrt(3)/ (sqrt(2)/sqrt(3)) )= 3/sqrt(2)≈2.121.

So, sum≈1.732 +2.121≈3.853<4.

So, f(u)=≈3.853 -4≈-0.147<0.

At u=0.6,

1/0.6≈1.6667,

sqrt(3)/sqrt(1 -0.36)=sqrt(3)/sqrt(0.64)=sqrt(3)/0.8≈1.732/0.8≈2.165.

Sum≈1.6667 +2.165≈3.8317<4.

At u=0.4,

1/0.4=2.5,

sqrt(3)/sqrt(1 -0.16)=sqrt(3)/sqrt(0.84)=≈1.732/0.9165≈1.89.

Sum≈2.5 +1.89≈4.39>4.

So, f(0.4)=≈0.39>0.

f(0.5)=0.

f(0.6)=≈-0.1683.

So, another solution between u=0.4 and u=0.5.

Wait, that suggests that the midpoint is on another PQ besides AB, which contradicts the problem statement.

But the problem says there's a unique point C on AB, distinct from A and B, that doesn't lie on any other PQ in F.

So, perhaps my earlier assumption is wrong, and the point C is not the midpoint.

Wait, perhaps the point C is where the line AB is tangent to the envelope, which is at p=1/2, but that's the entire segment AB. So, perhaps the only point on AB not lying on any other PQ is the point where AB is tangent to the envelope, which is the entire AB.

But this is conflicting.

Alternatively, perhaps the unique point C is the point where AB is tangent to the envelope, which is at p=1/2, but that's AB itself.

I'm stuck. Maybe I should consider that the point C is (1/4, sqrt(3)/4), even though it's on another PQ, and the problem statement is incorrect, but that's unlikely.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in my approach.

Wait, perhaps the answer is OC²=1/4, so p+q=1+4=5.

But earlier, this point lies on another PQ, which contradicts.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct OC² is 1/2, giving p+q=3.

But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to parametrize AB as x = (1 -t)/2, y= (sqrt(3)/2)t, and find t such that the line from (p,0) to (0, sqrt(1 -p²)) passes through (x,y) only when p=1/2.

So, for each t, the equation (x)/p + y/sqrt(1 -p²)=1 must have exactly one solution p=1/2.

Which would mean that the equation is satisfied only at p=1/2, implying that it's tangent.

So, the system:

( (1 -t)/2 ) /p + ( (sqrt(3)/2) t ) / sqrt(1 -p²)=1,

and

d/dp [ ( (1 -t)/2 ) /p + ( (sqrt(3)/2) t ) / sqrt(1 -p²) ] =0.

Set these equal and solve for t.

Compute the derivative:

d/dp [ (1 -t)/(2p) + (sqrt(3) t)/(2 sqrt(1 -p²)) ]

= - (1 -t)/(2p²) + (sqrt(3) t)/(2) * (p)/( (1 -p²)^(3/2) ).

Set this equal to zero:

- (1 -t)/(2p²) + (sqrt(3) t p)/(2 (1 -p²)^(3/2) )=0.

Multiply both sides by 2:

- (1 -t)/p² + (sqrt(3) t p)/(1 -p²)^(3/2)=0.

Rearrange:

(sqrt(3) t p)/(1 -p²)^(3/2)= (1 -t)/p².

Multiply both sides by p² (1 -p²)^(3/2):

sqrt(3) t p^3 = (1 -t) (1 -p²)^(3/2).

Now, from the original equation:

(1 -t)/(2p) + (sqrt(3) t)/(2 sqrt(1 -p²))=1.

Multiply both sides by 2:

(1 -t)/p + (sqrt(3) t)/sqrt(1 -p²)=2.

So, now we have two equations:

1. sqrt(3) t p^3 = (1 -t) (1 -p²)^(3/2).

2. (1 -t)/p + (sqrt(3) t)/sqrt(1 -p²)=2.

Let me denote u = p².

Then, 1 -p²=1 -u.

Equation 1 becomes:

sqrt(3) t p^3 = (1 -t) (1 -u)^(3/2).

But u=p², so p^3 = p * p² = p u.

So,

sqrt(3) t p u = (1 -t) (1 -u)^(3/2).

Equation 2:

(1 -t)/p + (sqrt(3) t)/sqrt(1 -u)=2.

Let me solve equation 2 for (1 -t):

(1 -t) = 2 p - (sqrt(3) t) sqrt(1 -u).

Substitute into equation 1:

sqrt(3) t p u = [2 p - (sqrt(3) t) sqrt(1 -u) ] (1 -u)^(3/2).

This seems complicated. Maybe assume t is a constant and solve for p.

Alternatively, perhaps make substitution v= sqrt(1 -u).

Then, u=1 -v².

So, equation 1:

sqrt(3) t p (1 -v²) = (1 -t) v^3.

Equation 2:

(1 -t)/p + (sqrt(3) t)/v=2.

Let me solve equation 2 for (1 -t):

(1 -t) = 2 p - (sqrt(3) t) v.

Substitute into equation1:

sqrt(3) t p (1 -v²) = [2 p - sqrt(3) t v ] v^3.

Expand:

sqrt(3) t p (1 -v²)=2 p v^3 - sqrt(3) t v^4.

Divide both sides by p (assuming p≠0):

sqrt(3) t (1 -v²)=2 v^3 - sqrt(3) t v^4 /p.

But this brings back p, which complicates things.

Alternatively, perhaps assume t is a constant and find p in terms of t.

Alternatively, perhaps try specific values.

Wait, earlier when we set p=1/2, we get t=1 -2*(1/2)^3=1 -2*(1/8)=1 -1/4=3/4.

So, t=3/4.

Then, point C is x=(1 -3/4)/2= (1/4)/2=1/8,

y=(sqrt(3)/2)*(3/4)= (3 sqrt(3))/8.

So, OC²= (1/8)^2 + (3 sqrt(3)/8)^2=1/64 + 27/64=28/64=7/16.

So, OC²=7/16.

Then, p=7, q=16, p+q=23.

But I'm not sure if this is correct.

Alternatively, perhaps this is the correct answer.

Wait, but in this case, when p=1/2, t=3/4.

So, point C is (1/8, 3 sqrt(3)/8).

But earlier, when I checked the midpoint, it was (1/4, sqrt(3)/4), which is different.

So, perhaps the correct OC² is 7/16, leading to p+q=23.

But I'm not entirely confident.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To solve the problem, we analyze the given points and segments. Points \( O(0,0) \), \( A\left(\frac{1}{2}, 0\right) \), and \( B\left(0, \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right) \) form the line segment \( \overline{AB} \) with the equation \( y = -\sqrt{3}x + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \). 

The family \( \mathcal{F} \) consists of segments \( \overline{PQ} \) of unit length with \( P \) on the x-axis and \( Q \) on the y-axis. Each segment \( \overline{PQ} \) lies on the line \( \frac{x}{p} + \frac{y}{\sqrt{1 - p^2}} = 1 \) for some \( p \in (0,1) \).

To find the unique point \( C \) on \( \overline{AB} \) not lying on any other segment from \( \mathcal{F} \) except \( \overline{AB} \), we consider the envelope of the family \( \mathcal{F} \). The envelope is found by solving the system:

\[
\frac{x}{p} + \frac{y}{\sqrt{1 - p^2}} = 1
\]
\[
-\frac{x}{p^2} + \frac{y p}{(1 - p^2)^{3/2}} = 0
\]

Solving these equations, we parametrize the envelope as \( x = p^3 \) and \( y = (1 - p^2)^{3/2} \). 

Point \( C \) lies on both \( \overline{AB} \) and the envelope. Substituting the parametric equations of \( \overline{AB} \) into the envelope equations, we solve for \( p \) and find that the unique point \( C \) corresponds to \( p = \frac{1}{2} \), giving \( OC^2 = \frac{7}{16} \).

Thus, \( p = 7 \) and \( q = 16 \), leading to \( p + q = 23 \).

\boxed{23}
