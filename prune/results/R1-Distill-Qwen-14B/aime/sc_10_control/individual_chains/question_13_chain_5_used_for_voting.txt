Okay, so let me try to figure out this problem step by step. I'm a bit confused, but I'll take it slow.

So, Aya walks 9 kilometers every morning. She walks at a constant speed, and sometimes it takes her 4 hours, other times 2 hours and 24 minutes. Hmm, wait, but she also stops at a coffee shop for t minutes each time. The problem says that when she walks at speed s km/h, the total time is 4 hours, which includes t minutes in the coffee shop. Similarly, when she walks at s+2 km/h, the total time is 2 hours and 24 minutes, also including t minutes.

We need to find how long her walk takes when she walks at s + 1/2 km/h, including t minutes again.

Wait, so the key here is that the walking time plus the coffee shop time equals the total time given in each scenario.

Let me write down what I know:

1. Distance = 9 km.
2. First scenario: speed = s km/h, total time = 4 hours = 240 minutes. This includes walking time plus t minutes in the coffee shop.
3. Second scenario: speed = s + 2 km/h, total time = 2 hours 24 minutes = 144 minutes. Again, this includes walking time plus t minutes.

I need to find the total time when the speed is s + 1/2 km/h.

First, maybe I can set up equations for each scenario.

In the first scenario, the time she spends walking is distance divided by speed, so 9/s hours. Then, she spends t minutes in the coffee shop. But wait, the total time given is in hours, so maybe I should convert t into hours or keep everything in hours.

Wait, the total time is 4 hours, which is 240 minutes. But the coffee shop time is t minutes. So perhaps it's better to convert the walking time into minutes as well.

Wait, maybe not. Let me think. Let's convert everything into hours because speed is in km/h.

So, for the first case:

Walking time = 9 / s hours.

Total time = walking time + coffee time. But coffee time t is in minutes, so I need to convert it to hours by dividing by 60.

So,

9/s + t/60 = 4.

Similarly, for the second scenario:

Walking time = 9 / (s + 2) hours.

Total time = 2 hours 24 minutes. 24 minutes is 24/60 = 0.4 hours, so total time is 2.4 hours.

So,

9/(s + 2) + t/60 = 2.4.

Now, I have two equations:

1. 9/s + t/60 = 4

2. 9/(s + 2) + t/60 = 2.4

Hmm, so I can subtract equation 2 from equation 1 to eliminate t.

Wait, let's write them as:

Equation 1: 9/s + t/60 = 4

Equation 2: 9/(s + 2) + t/60 = 2.4

Subtract equation 2 from equation 1:

[9/s + t/60] - [9/(s + 2) + t/60] = 4 - 2.4

Simplify:

9/s - 9/(s + 2) = 1.6

Now, let's compute 9/s - 9/(s+2):

Factor 9: 9 [1/s - 1/(s + 2)] = 1.6

Compute inside the brackets:

1/s - 1/(s + 2) = [ (s + 2) - s ] / [s(s + 2)] = 2 / [s(s + 2)]

So,

9 * [2 / (s(s + 2))] = 1.6

Which is 18 / [s(s + 2)] = 1.6

Let me write that as 18 = 1.6 * s(s + 2)

So,

1.6 s(s + 2) = 18

Divide both sides by 1.6:

s(s + 2) = 18 / 1.6

Compute 18 / 1.6. Let's see, 1.6 is 8/5, so 18 * (5/8) = (18*5)/8 = 90/8 = 11.25.

So,

s^2 + 2s = 11.25

Bring 11.25 to the left:

s^2 + 2s - 11.25 = 0

This is a quadratic equation in s. Let's solve for s.

Using quadratic formula: s = [-b ± sqrt(b² - 4ac)] / (2a)

Here, a = 1, b = 2, c = -11.25

Discriminant D = b² - 4ac = 4 - 4*1*(-11.25) = 4 + 45 = 49

So,

s = [ -2 ± sqrt(49) ] / 2 = [ -2 ± 7 ] / 2

So, two solutions:

s = (-2 +7)/2 = 5/2 = 2.5

s = (-2 -7)/2 = -9/2 = -4.5

Since speed can't be negative, we take s = 2.5 km/h.

Wait, so s is 2.5 km/h. Hmm.

Now, let's find t. Let's plug s back into one of the equations.

Let's take equation 1:

9/s + t/60 = 4

So,

9/(2.5) + t/60 = 4

Compute 9/2.5: 9 divided by 2.5 is 3.6 hours.

So,

3.6 + t/60 = 4

Subtract 3.6:

t/60 = 0.4

Multiply both sides by 60:

t = 0.4 * 60 = 24 minutes.

So, she spends 24 minutes in the coffee shop each time.

Now, the question is: what is the total time when she walks at s + 1/2 km/h, including the 24 minutes.

So, s + 1/2 = 2.5 + 0.5 = 3 km/h.

So, new speed is 3 km/h.

Walking time is 9 km / 3 km/h = 3 hours.

Plus coffee shop time of 24 minutes.

So, total time is 3 hours + 24 minutes.

Convert 3 hours to minutes: 180 minutes. 180 +24=204 minutes.

Alternatively, 3 hours is 3*60=180, plus 24=204.

So, the answer is 204 minutes.

Aya walks 9 kilometers each morning. When walking at a speed of \( s \) km/h, the total time is 4 hours (240 minutes), which includes walking time and \( t \) minutes spent in the coffee shop. Similarly, when walking at \( s+2 \) km/h, the total time is 2 hours and 24 minutes (144 minutes), also including \( t \) minutes. We need to find the total time when Aya walks at \( s+\frac{1}{2} \) km/h, including \( t \) minutes.

### Step 1: Set up the equations
For the first scenario:
\[
\frac{9}{s} + \frac{t}{60} = 4
\]
For the second scenario:
\[
\frac{9}{s+2} + \frac{t}{60} = 2.4
\]

### Step 2: Subtract the equations to eliminate \( t \)
\[
\frac{9}{s} - \frac{9}{s+2} = 1.6
\]
Simplify:
\[
9 \left( \frac{2}{s(s+2)} \right) = 1.6 \implies \frac{18}{s(s+2)} = 1.6
\]
\[
1.6s(s+2) = 18 \implies s(s+2) = 11.25
\]
\[
s^2 + 2s - 11.25 = 0
\]

### Step 3: Solve the quadratic equation
Using the quadratic formula:
\[
s = \frac{-2 \pm \sqrt{4 + 45}}{2} = \frac{-2 \pm 7}{2}
\]
The positive solution is \( s = 2.5 \) km/h.

### Step 4: Find \( t \)
Substitute \( s = 2.5 \) into the first equation:
\[
\frac{9}{2.5} + \frac{t}{60} = 4 \implies 3.6 + \frac{t}{60} = 4 \implies \frac{t}{60} = 0.4 \implies t = 24 \text{ minutes.}
\]

### Step 5: Calculate the total time at \( s+\frac{1}{2} = 3 \) km/h
Walking time:
\[
\frac{9}{3} = 3 \text{ hours.}
\]
Total time including coffee shop:
\[
3 \text{ hours} + 24 \text{ minutes} = 204 \text{ minutes.}
\]

The total time is \(\boxed{204}\) minutes.
