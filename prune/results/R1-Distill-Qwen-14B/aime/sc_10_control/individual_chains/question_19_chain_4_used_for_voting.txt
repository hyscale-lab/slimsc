Okay, I've got this geometry problem here. Let me see if I can figure it out. So, the problem says:

Let triangle ABC have circumcenter O and incenter I with IA perpendicular to OI. The circumradius is 13, and the inradius is 6. We need to find the product AB times AC.

Hmm, okay. So, triangle ABC has its circumradius (R) as 13 and inradius (r) as 6. The incenter I and circumcenter O are such that IA is perpendicular to OI. Interesting condition.

I remember that in a triangle, the circumradius R is related to the sides by the formula R = (a*b*c)/(4*Δ), where a, b, c are the sides and Δ is the area. The inradius r is given by r = Δ/s, where s is the semi-perimeter.

But I don't know if that's directly helpful here. Let me think about the condition IA perpendicular to OI.

Wait, IA is the line from the incenter I to vertex A, and OI is the line from the circumcenter O to the incenter I. So, these two lines are perpendicular. That seems like a specific condition that might relate some properties of the triangle.

I think there might be some formula or theorem related to this condition. Let me try to recall. I remember something about the distance between the incenter and circumcenter: OI^2 = R(R - 2r). Wait, is that correct?

Yes, I think that's a standard formula: the square of the distance between the incenter and circumcenter is equal to R(R - 2r). So, in this case, OI^2 = 13*(13 - 12) = 13*1 = 13. So OI = sqrt(13).

Wait, so OI is sqrt(13). But the problem says IA is perpendicular to OI. Hmm. So, in the triangle IOA, angle at I is 90 degrees. So, triangle IOA is right-angled at I.

So, by the Pythagorean theorem, OA^2 = IO^2 + IA^2. But OA is the circumradius, which is 13. IA is the length from inradius to vertex A.

Wait, I think IA can be expressed in terms of the triangle's sides and angles. IA is the distance from the incenter to vertex A. I remember that the distance from the incenter to a vertex can be given by the formula:

IA = r / sin(A/2)

Is that correct? Let me think. Yes, I think that's right. Because in the triangle formed by the inradius and the angle bisector, the inradius is opposite to angle A/2, and the hypotenuse is IA.

So, IA = r / sin(A/2). Since r is 6, IA = 6 / sin(A/2).

So, going back to the right triangle IOA: OA^2 = IO^2 + IA^2.

We have OA = 13, IO = sqrt(13), IA = 6 / sin(A/2).

So plugging in, 13^2 = (sqrt(13))^2 + (6 / sin(A/2))^2.

Calculating, 169 = 13 + (36)/(sin^2(A/2)).

Subtract 13 from both sides: 156 = 36 / sin^2(A/2).

Then, sin^2(A/2) = 36 / 156. Let's simplify that.

36 divided by 156. Let's divide numerator and denominator by 12: 3/13. So, sin^2(A/2) = 3/13.

So, sin(A/2) = sqrt(3/13). Therefore, cos(A/2) can be found using the identity sin^2 + cos^2 = 1.

So, cos^2(A/2) = 1 - 3/13 = 10/13, so cos(A/2) = sqrt(10/13).

Wait, but why do I need this? Because I think the sides AB and AC can be related to the angles.

Wait, AB and AC are sides opposite to angles C and B, respectively. But maybe I'm getting confused. Let me think differently.

In triangle ABC, AB is side c, BC is side a, and AC is side b. So, AB = c, AC = b. So, the product AB*AC is b*c.

Hmm. So, perhaps I can find expressions for b and c in terms of the given data.

Alternatively, maybe I can find angle A, then use the Law of Cosines or something similar.

Since I have sin(A/2) and cos(A/2), maybe I can find sin A or cos A.

Wait, using double-angle formulas: sin A = 2 sin(A/2) cos(A/2) = 2*(sqrt(3/13))*(sqrt(10/13)) ) = 2*sqrt(30)/13.

Similarly, cos A = 1 - 2 sin^2(A/2) = 1 - 2*(3/13) = 1 - 6/13 = 7/13.

Alternatively, cos A = 2 cos^2(A/2) - 1 = 2*(10/13) - 1 = 20/13 - 13/13 = 7/13. Yep, same result.

So, cos A = 7/13 and sin A = 2*sqrt(30)/13.

Now, in triangle ABC, the Law of Cosines relates the sides:

cos A = (b^2 + c^2 - a^2)/(2bc). Hmm, but I don't know side a. Wait, but is there another way?

Alternatively, the area of the triangle can be expressed in two ways: using inradius and semi-perimeter, and using sides and angles.

Wait, the area Δ is r*s, where s is the semi-perimeter. Also, Δ = (1/2)*bc*sin A.

Since we have r = 6, and R = 13, perhaps we can find s.

But wait, I don't know the semi-perimeter yet. Hmm.

Alternatively, in terms of R, the sides can be expressed as a = 2R sin A, but wait, that's for the circumradius formula where a = 2R sin A, right?

Wait, no, more precisely, in the Law of Sines, a = 2R sin A, b = 2R sin B, c = 2R sin C.

So, a = 2*13*sin A = 26*(2*sqrt(30)/13) ) = 26*(2 sqrt(30)/13) )= 4 sqrt(30).

Wait, let me double-check. Sin A is 2 sqrt(30)/13, so a = 2R sin A = 2*13*(2 sqrt(30)/13) = 2*2 sqrt(30) = 4 sqrt(30).

Similarly, sides b and c can be expressed as 2R sin B and 2R sin C, respectively.

But without knowing angles B and C, that might not help directly.

Wait, but maybe we can relate the semi-perimeter. The semi-perimeter s = (a + b + c)/2.

Also, the area Δ can be expressed as r*s = 6s. And Δ can also be expressed as (1/2)*b*c*sin A.

So, 6s = (1/2)*b*c*sin A.

But sin A we have as 2 sqrt(30)/13.

So, 6s = (1/2)*b*c*(2 sqrt(30)/13).

Simplifying, 6s = (b*c sqrt(30))/13.

So, 6s = (b c sqrt(30))/13. --> Equation (1)

But we need another equation to relate b and c.

Wait, perhaps using the Law of Cosines. Since we know cos A = 7/13, and a^2 = b^2 + c^2 - 2bc cos A.

We can write that as:

a^2 = b^2 + c^2 - 2bc*(7/13).

But a is 4 sqrt(30), so a^2 = 16*30 = 480.

So, 480 = b^2 + c^2 - (14/13) bc.

Hmm. So, we have 480 = b^2 + c^2 - (14/13) bc. --> Equation (2)

And from Equation (1), we have 6s = (b c sqrt(30))/13.

But s is (a + b + c)/2. So, s = (4 sqrt(30) + b + c)/2.

So, plugging into Equation (1):

6*( (4 sqrt(30) + b + c)/2 ) = (b c sqrt(30))/13.

Simplify left side: 6*( (4 sqrt(30) + b + c)/2 ) = 3*(4 sqrt(30) + b + c) = 12 sqrt(30) + 3b + 3c.

So, 12 sqrt(30) + 3b + 3c = (b c sqrt(30))/13.

Hmm, this seems complicated. Maybe we can let x = b + c and y = bc, so that we can write equations in terms of x and y.

Let me try that.

Let x = b + c, y = bc.

Then, Equation (1) becomes:

12 sqrt(30) + 3x = (y sqrt(30))/13.

Equation (2) becomes:

480 = (b^2 + c^2) - (14/13) y.

But b^2 + c^2 can be written as (b + c)^2 - 2bc = x^2 - 2y.

So,

480 = x^2 - 2y - (14/13) y = x^2 - (2 + 14/13)y = x^2 - (30/13) y.

So, Equation (2): 480 = x^2 - (30/13)y --> Equation (2a)

Equation (1a): 12 sqrt(30) + 3x = (y sqrt(30))/13.

Let me solve Equation (1a) for y.

Multiply both sides by 13:

13*(12 sqrt(30) + 3x) = y sqrt(30).

So,

156 sqrt(30) + 39x = y sqrt(30).

Divide both sides by sqrt(30):

156 + (39x)/sqrt(30) = y.

So, y = 156 + (39x)/sqrt(30).

Wait, but this might get messy. Maybe rationalize the denominator.

(39x)/sqrt(30) = (39x sqrt(30))/30 = (13x sqrt(30))/10.

So, y = 156 + (13x sqrt(30))/10.

Now, plug this into Equation (2a):

480 = x^2 - (30/13)y.

Substitute y:

480 = x^2 - (30/13)*(156 + (13x sqrt(30))/10 ).

Simplify the terms:

First, (30/13)*156 = (30/13)*(13*12) )= 30*12 = 360.

Second, (30/13)*(13x sqrt(30)/10) )= (30/13)*(13/10)x sqrt(30) )= (3/1)*(x sqrt(30)) )= 3x sqrt(30).

So, 480 = x^2 - [360 + 3x sqrt(30)].

Rearranging: x^2 - 3x sqrt(30) - 360 = 480.

Wait, 480 = x^2 - 360 - 3x sqrt(30).

Bring 480 to the right: 0 = x^2 - 3x sqrt(30) - 360 - 480.

Wait, that can't be. Wait, 480 = x^2 - 360 - 3x sqrt(30).

So, bring all terms to the left: x^2 - 3x sqrt(30) - 360 - 480 = 0.

Wait, 480 = x^2 - 360 - 3x sqrt(30).

So, 480 - 360 = x^2 - 3x sqrt(30).

So, 120 = x^2 - 3x sqrt(30).

Then,

x^2 - 3 sqrt(30) x - 120 = 0.

This is a quadratic equation in x. Let me write it as:

x^2 - 3 sqrt(30) x - 120 = 0.

Let me solve this quadratic for x.

Using quadratic formula: x = [3 sqrt(30) ± sqrt( (3 sqrt(30))^2 + 480 ) ] / 2.

Calculate discriminant:

(3 sqrt(30))^2 = 9*30 = 270.

So, discriminant is 270 + 480 = 750.

So, sqrt(750) = sqrt(25*30) = 5 sqrt(30).

So, x = [3 sqrt(30) ± 5 sqrt(30)] / 2.

So, two solutions:

x = (3 sqrt(30) + 5 sqrt(30))/2 = (8 sqrt(30))/2 = 4 sqrt(30).

Or x = (3 sqrt(30) - 5 sqrt(30))/2 = (-2 sqrt(30))/2 = -sqrt(30).

But x is the sum of sides b and c, which must be positive. So, x = 4 sqrt(30).

So, x = 4 sqrt(30).

Now, using Equation (1a):

y = 156 + (13x sqrt(30))/10.

Plugging x = 4 sqrt(30):

y = 156 + (13*(4 sqrt(30)) * sqrt(30))/10.

Simplify sqrt(30)*sqrt(30) = 30.

So,

y = 156 + (13*4*30)/10.

Calculate 13*4 = 52; 52*30=1560; 1560/10=156.

So, y = 156 + 156 = 312.

So, y = 312.

But y = bc, so bc = 312.

But AB is side c, AC is side b, so AB*AC = bc = 312.

So, the answer is 312.

Wait, that seems straightforward now. Let me just recap the steps to make sure I didn't make an error:

1. Calculated OI^2 = R(R - 2r) = 13*(13 - 12) = 13, so OI = sqrt(13).

2. Used the right triangle IOA to write OA^2 = OI^2 + IA^2. OA is 13, so 169 = 13 + IA^2, leading to IA^2 = 156. IA is 6 / sin(A/2), so (6 / sin(A/2))^2 = 156. Therefore, sin(A/2) = sqrt(3/13).

3. Found cos(A/2) = sqrt(10/13), then found sin A = 2 sqrt(30)/13 and cos A = 7/13.

4. Expressed side a (BC) as 4 sqrt(30) using Law of Sines.

5. Set up equations using area expressions and Law of Cosines, leading to a system of equations in terms of b + c and bc.

6. Solved for x = b + c and y = bc, ending up with bc = 312.

So, everything seems to check out.


--- Final Answer Content ---


Given triangle \( \triangle ABC \) with circumcenter \( O \), incenter \( I \), circumradius \( R = 13 \), inradius \( r = 6 \), and \( \overline{IA} \perp \overline{OI} \), we aim to find \( AB \cdot AC \).

1. **Distance \( OI \)**:
   Using the formula \( OI^2 = R(R - 2r) \):
   \[
   OI^2 = 13(13 - 12) = 13 \implies OI = \sqrt{13}.
   \]

2. **Right Triangle \( \triangle IOA \)**:
   Since \( \overline{IA} \perp \overline{OI} \), by the Pythagorean theorem:
   \[
   OA^2 = OI^2 + IA^2 \implies 13^2 = (\sqrt{13})^2 + IA^2 \implies 169 = 13 + IA^2 \implies IA^2 = 156.
   \]
   Thus, \( IA = \sqrt{156} \).

3. **Expressing \( IA \)**:
   The distance from the incenter to vertex \( A \) is given by \( IA = \frac{r}{\sin(A/2)} \):
   \[
   \frac{6}{\sin(A/2)} = \sqrt{156} \implies \sin(A/2) = \frac{6}{\sqrt{156}} = \sqrt{\frac{3}{13}}.
   \]
   Using \( \cos^2(A/2) = 1 - \sin^2(A/2) \):
   \[
   \cos(A/2) = \sqrt{\frac{10}{13}}.
   \]

4. **Finding \( \sin A \) and \( \cos A \)**:
   Using double-angle identities:
   \[
   \sin A = 2 \sin(A/2) \cos(A/2) = 2 \sqrt{\frac{3}{13}} \sqrt{\frac{10}{13}} = \frac{2\sqrt{30}}{13},
   \]
   \[
   \cos A = 1 - 2 \sin^2(A/2) = 1 - \frac{6}{13} = \frac{7}{13}.
   \]

5. **Side \( a \) (BC)**:
   Using the Law of Sines:
   \[
   a = 2R \sin A = 2 \cdot 13 \cdot \frac{2\sqrt{30}}{13} = 4\sqrt{30}.
   \]

6. **Area Expressions**:
   The area \( \Delta \) can be expressed as \( \Delta = r \cdot s \) and \( \Delta = \frac{1}{2} bc \sin A \), where \( s \) is the semi-perimeter. Equating:
   \[
   6s = \frac{1}{2} bc \cdot \frac{2\sqrt{30}}{13} \implies 6s = \frac{bc \sqrt{30}}{13}.
   \]
   Also, using the Law of Cosines for side \( a \):
   \[
   a^2 = b^2 + c^2 - 2bc \cos A \implies 480 = b^2 + c^2 - \frac{14}{13} bc.
   \]

7. **Solving for \( bc \)**:
   Let \( x = b + c \) and \( y = bc \). From the equations:
   \[
   12\sqrt{30} + 3x = \frac{y \sqrt{30}}{13} \quad \text{and} \quad 480 = x^2 - \frac{30}{13} y.
   \]
   Solving these, we find \( x = 4\sqrt{30} \) and \( y = 312 \).

Thus, the product \( AB \cdot AC = bc = 312 \).

\[
\boxed{312}
\]
