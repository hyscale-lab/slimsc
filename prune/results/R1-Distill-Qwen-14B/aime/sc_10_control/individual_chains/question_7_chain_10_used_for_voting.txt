Okay, so I have this problem about a regular octagon where each vertex is colored either red or blue independently with equal probability. The question is about finding the probability that we can rotate the octagon such that all the blue vertices end up where there were originally red vertices. The answer should be in the form of a fraction m/n where m and n are coprime, and then find m + n.

Hmm, let me try to understand the problem. So, we're dealing with a regular octagon, which means it has 8 sides, and all sides and angles are equal. Each vertex is colored red or blue, each with a 50% chance, and each color is assigned independently. So, the total number of possible colorings is 2^8 = 256.

But the problem isn't just about any coloring. It's about colorings where there exists some rotation of the octagon such that all the blue vertices move to positions that were previously red. So, if I imagine rotating the octagon by some number of steps (like 45 degrees, 90 degrees, etc.), after the rotation, every blue vertex should now be on a vertex that was red before the rotation.

Wait, actually, I need to clarify that. The problem says the octagon can be rotated so that all blue vertices end up at positions where there were originally red vertices. So, the rotation is applied to the octagon, and after the rotation, the blue vertices should now be on the red positions. So, the original positions are the ones before rotation, I think? Or maybe it's the other way around. Wait, no, let me think again.

If we have the octagon with some red and blue vertices, and then we rotate it such that all the blue ones move to where there were reds. So, after rotation, the blue vertices are on the positions that were originally red. So, before rotation, suppose the octagon has some blue and red vertices. After rotation, the blue ones occupy the red positions. So, the rotated octagon's blue positions coincide with the original red positions.

Wait, perhaps it's better to model this mathematically. Let me denote the original coloring as a vector c = (c1, c2, ..., c8), where each ci is either red or blue. Then, a rotation by k steps would result in a new coloring c' where c'_i = c_{(i - k) mod 8} for each i from 1 to 8. So, the rotated coloring is a cyclic permutation of the original coloring.

The problem is asking for the probability that there exists some k (from 0 to 7, since it's an octagon) such that for every i, if c'_i is blue, then the original c_i was red. Wait, no, that's not quite right. Let me think again.

Wait, no. After rotation, the blue vertices in the rotated coloring should correspond to the red vertices in the original coloring. So, if c'_i is blue, then the original c_i must be red. But c'_i is c_{(i - k) mod 8}. So, for each i, if c'_{i} is blue, then c_{(i - k) mod 8} must be red.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think in terms of the original coloring: after rotation by k steps, the blue vertices in the original coloring would map to certain positions. Wait, no. Actually, I think the problem is that after rotation, the blue vertices of the original octagon are moved to positions that were red in the original octagon. So, for the rotated octagon, the blue vertices are exactly the positions that were red in the original. So, the rotated octagon's blue set is equal to the original red set.

Wait, maybe not. Let me try to clarify.

Suppose we have an original octagon with some red and blue vertices. Then we rotate it by some number of steps, say k. After rotation, the new positions of the vertices are such that the blue vertices from the original are now at positions that were red in the original. So, the set of blue vertices in the original coloring is mapped via rotation k to the set of red vertices in the original coloring.

Wait, that sounds a bit more precise. So, the rotation k must satisfy that the set of blue vertices is equal to the rotation by k of the set of red vertices. But the set of blue vertices is the complement of the set of red vertices, since each vertex is either red or blue.

Wait, let me formalize this. Let R be the set of red vertices in the original coloring, and B be the set of blue vertices. Then, the condition is that there exists a rotation k such that B = R + k mod 8. But since B is the complement of R, this would imply that R + k = B, which is R^c.

So, R + k = R^c, which implies that R + k is the complement of R, which is equivalent to R + k = (R)^c. So, in other words, R is a subset that is equal to the complement of its own rotation by k. That is, R is a set such that when you rotate it by k, you get its complement.

But another way to put it is that R is a subset of the octagon's vertices such that R is a translate (by k) of its complement. So, R = R^c + k mod 8.

Wait, but since R and R^c are complements, if R is a translate of R^c, then R is equal to R^c shifted by k. But R^c is the complement of R, so it's 8 - |R| elements. So, for such a situation to happen, the size of R must equal the size of R^c shifted by k, but since shifting doesn't change the size, that's always true. So, perhaps this is possible for certain sizes of R.

Wait, but in the case of an octagon, which has 8 vertices, if R has size m, then R^c has size 8 - m. So, for R to be equal to R^c shifted by k, it must have the same size as R^c, so m = 8 - m, implying m = 4. So, R must have exactly 4 elements, and R is equal to R^c shifted by k. So, R is a subset of size 4 that is equal to its complement shifted by some k.

Wait, but is this possible? For example, in a regular octagon, the set R could be the four even-numbered vertices, and shifting by 1 would give the four odd-numbered vertices, which are the complement. So, in that case, R would be equal to R^c shifted by 1.

Wait, let me check: let R be {1,3,5,7}, the odd positions. Then R^c is {2,4,6,8}, the even positions. If I shift R by 1, we get {2,4,6,8}, which is exactly R^c. So, yes, in this case, R is equal to R^c shifted by 1. So, such sets R do exist.

So, the problem reduces to colorings where the set of red vertices is a subset R of size 4 such that R is equal to R^c shifted by some rotation k. Then, the blue vertices would be R^c, which is exactly R shifted by k. So, in such a case, rotating the octagon by k steps would cause all the blue vertices (which are R^c) to move to the positions of R, which were originally red.

Wait, but the problem says that the octagon is colored red or blue, and we need to find the probability that there exists a rotation such that all blue vertices end up on positions that were originally red. So, this would happen if the set of blue vertices is a rotation of the set of red vertices. Which, as we saw earlier, can only happen if the number of blue and red vertices is equal, since the rotation preserves the size. So, each must have exactly 4 vertices.

So, the first condition is that exactly four vertices are red and four are blue. The number of such colorings is C(8,4) = 70, each with probability (1/2)^8. So, the total probability for this case is 70*(1/256).

But not all such colorings will satisfy the condition that the blue set is a rotation of the red set. So, we need to find how many such subsets R of size 4 satisfy R = (R^c) + k mod 8 for some k.

Wait, but as I saw in the example, the set R = {1,3,5,7} satisfies R = R^c +1. Similarly, R = {2,4,6,8} would satisfy R = R^c +1 as well. Wait, no, let me check that.

Wait, R = {1,3,5,7}, R^c = {2,4,6,8}. So R^c shifted by 1 would be {3,5,7,1}, which is R again. So yes, R is equal to R^c shifted by 1.

Similarly, if I take R as {0,2,4,6}, then R^c is {1,3,5,7}, and shifting R by 1 would give {1,3,5,7}, which is R^c. So, R = R^c +1 in this case as well.

Wait, but in the earlier example, R was {1,3,5,7}, and shifting by 1, we got R^c. So, that's the same as R^c = R +1.

So, in any case, the condition is that R is a subset of size 4 such that R is equal to R^c shifted by some k, which implies that R is a subset that is a translate of its complement.

So, how many such subsets R are there? Let me try to count them.

In the example above, {1,3,5,7} is such a subset. Similarly, {0,2,4,6} is another. Are there more?

Wait, perhaps for each rotation, there's a unique such subset. Let me think. Since the octagon is regular, the symmetry might imply that for each possible rotation, there's only one such subset R that is a translate of its complement. But I'm not sure.

Wait, in the examples I gave, shifting R by 1 gives R^c, but shifting R by 2 would give {2,4,6,8}, which is not the complement of R. So, perhaps each such R is associated with a unique shift k.

Alternatively, perhaps each such R is a so-called "balanced" set, where it's equal to its complement shifted by some k.

Wait, another way to think about this is that such a set R must be a union of cosets of some subgroup in the cyclic group Z_8. But since 8 is 2^3, the subgroups are of order 1, 2, 4, and 8. So, for example, the subset {0,2,4,6} is a subgroup of order 4, and its complement is {1,3,5,7}, which is another coset of the subgroup generated by 2. Shifting this by 1, we get {1,3,5,7}, which is the complement.

So, perhaps the possible R's are exactly the union of two cosets of a subgroup of order 4 in Z_8. There are two such subgroups: one generated by 2, which gives {0,2,4,6}, and another generated by 1, which is the entire group. But wait, the subgroup generated by 1 is the entire group, which isn't useful here.

Wait, perhaps I should think of the possible R's as those that form a subgroup of order 4. So, in Z_8, the subgroups of order 4 are generated by 2 and 4. Wait, actually, in Z_8, the elements of order 4 are 2 and 6, because 2*4=8≡0 mod8. Wait, no, in Z_8, the subgroup generated by 2 is {0,2,4,6}, which is indeed a subgroup of order 4. Similarly, the subgroup generated by 4 is {0,4}, which is a subgroup of order 2. So, perhaps the only subgroup of order 4 in Z_8 is {0,2,4,6}.

Wait, but then the complement of this subgroup is {1,3,5,7}, which is another coset of the subgroup generated by 2. So, if I shift {0,2,4,6} by 1, I get {1,3,5,7}, which is its complement. So, this gives one such subset R.

Similarly, if I take R as {1,3,5,7}, then shifting by 1 gives {2,4,6,0}, which is the complement of R. So, that's another R.

Wait, but in Z_8, the cosets of the subgroup {0,2,4,6} are {0,2,4,6} and {1,3,5,7}. So, these are the only two possible R's that are translates of their complements. So, each of these R's when shifted by 1, gives their complement.

So, are these the only possible R's that satisfy R = R^c +k for some k? Or are there more?

Wait, let me check another example. Suppose R is {0,1,4,5}. Is this a translate of its complement? The complement is {2,3,6,7}. Let's see: shifting R by 2, we get {2,3,6,7}, which is the complement. So, R shifted by 2 is equal to R^c. So, in this case, R is equal to R^c shifted by -2, which is equivalent to shifting by 6 in Z_8.

So, that's another R which satisfies the condition. Hmm, so that's another subset. So, perhaps there are more such R's beyond just the cosets of the subgroup.

Wait, so let me think: how can a set R be a translate of its complement? That is, R = R^c + k for some k.

So, in other words, for some k, R shifted by k is equal to R^c.

Which implies that R is a set such that when you shift it by k, you get its complement.

So, for example, as I saw, R = {0,1,4,5} shifted by 2 gives {2,3,6,7}, which is the complement of R. So, this is another R that satisfies the condition.

So, how many such R's are there in total? Let me try to find all such subsets.

Since each R has 4 elements, and R must be equal to R^c shifted by some k.

So, for each possible shift k from 1 to 7 (since shifting by 0 would mean R = R^c, which is impossible unless R is empty or the entire set, which isn't the case here), we can check if R shifted by k is equal to R^c.

Alternatively, perhaps for each possible shift k, there's a unique R that satisfies R shifted by k equals R^c.

Wait, but perhaps it's better to model this as a system of equations.

Let me denote the positions as 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7.

Suppose R is a subset of size 4, and R +k = R^c.

So, for each x in R, x +k is in R^c. And for each y in R^c, y is in R +k, so y = x +k for some x in R.

Since R and R^c are complements, R +k must be equal to R^c.

So, R +k = R^c.

So, the set R must be a subset such that it is equal to the complement of its shift by k.

So, for each k, how many such R's exist?

Wait, let me consider the possibilities for k.

Since the octagon is cyclic, the possible shifts are 0 to 7. But if k is 0, then R = R^c, which is impossible unless R is empty or the entire set, which can't be as R has size 4. So, k can be from 1 to 7.

But let me think: for each k, does there exist a unique R such that R +k = R^c?

Wait, perhaps not. Alternatively, for each possible R, there's some k such that R +k = R^c.

Wait, but in the examples I gave, R = {0,2,4,6} satisfies R +1 = R^c, which is {1,3,5,7}.

Similarly, R = {1,3,5,7} satisfies R +1 = R^c, which is {0,2,4,6}.

But then R = {0,1,4,5} satisfies R +2 = R^c, which is {2,3,6,7}.

Similarly, R = {2,3,6,7} satisfies R +2 = R^c, which is {0,1,4,5}.

So, for each shift k, there are two possible R's: R and R^c. Because for shift k, if R satisfies R +k = R^c, then R^c +k = R.

Wait, let's see. If R +k = R^c, then (R^c) +k = (R +k)^c = R^c. Wait, that doesn't seem right. Wait, no, the complement of R +k is R^c +k, since adding k is a bijection.

Wait, maybe I should think in terms of set operations.

If R +k = R^c, then taking the complement of both sides, we get (R +k)^c = R.

But (R +k)^c is equal to R^c + (-k), since the complement of a shifted set is the shift of the complement by the inverse element.

So, R^c + (-k) = R.

Which implies that R^c = R +k.

So, if R +k = R^c, then R^c + (-k) = R.

Which is consistent. So, for each k, the equation R +k = R^c defines R uniquely, but perhaps for each k, there are two solutions.

Wait, in the examples I saw earlier, for k=1, R could be {0,2,4,6} or {1,3,5,7}, which are complements of each other. Similarly, for k=2, R could be {0,1,4,5} or {2,3,6,7}.

So, for each k, there are two possible R's that satisfy R +k = R^c.

Since there are 7 possible shifts (k=1 to 7), and for each, two possible R's, that would give 14 subsets R of size 4 satisfying the condition. But wait, let's check if that's accurate.

Wait, but let me check for k=3. Let me try to find an R such that R +3 = R^c.

Let me assume R is a subset of size 4. Let me try R = {0,1,2,3}. Then R +3 is {3,4,5,6}, which is {3,4,5,6}. The complement of R is {4,5,6,7}. So, {3,4,5,6} is not equal to {4,5,6,7}, so this R doesn't work.

Alternatively, let me try R = {0,1,3,4}. Then R +3 is {3,4,6,7}. The complement of R is {2,5,6,7}. So, {3,4,6,7} is not equal to {2,5,6,7}, so that doesn't work.

Hmm, maybe there's no solution for k=3. Let me try another approach.

Suppose R +k = R^c. Then, since R +k must consist of exactly 4 elements, and R and R^c are complements, this equation must hold.

Wait, perhaps for a given k, the equation R +k = R^c can have zero or two solutions R.

Wait, in the cases where k and 8 are coprime, perhaps we have solutions. But since 8 is 2^3, the shifts that are coprime to 8 are 1,3,5,7. So, for k=1,3,5,7, perhaps there are solutions, while for k=2,4,6, there are no solutions.

Wait, but in the earlier examples, for k=2, I found R = {0,1,4,5} and R = {2,3,6,7}, which satisfy R +2 = R^c. So, that's possible. So, perhaps for all k from 1 to 7, there are two subsets R satisfying R +k = R^c.

Wait, but earlier, when I tried k=3, I couldn't find such an R. Maybe I need to think differently.

Wait, perhaps for each k, there are two subsets R of size 4 such that R +k = R^c.

So, for each k from 1 to 7, two R's, giving a total of 14 subsets. But wait, let's check for k=3.

Let me try to find R such that R +3 = R^c. Let me suppose R is {0,1,4,5}. Then R +3 is {3,4,7,0}, which is {0,3,4,7}. The complement of R is {2,3,6,7}. So, {0,3,4,7} is not equal to {2,3,6,7}, so that doesn't work.

Alternatively, perhaps R = {0,2,4,6} and shifting by 3 gives {3,5,7,1}, which is the same as R shifted by 3. But the complement of R is {1,3,5,7}, which is not equal to {3,5,7,1}, which is the same as the complement, just reordered. Wait, but {3,5,7,1} is the same as {1,3,5,7}, just cyclically shifted. So, perhaps R shifted by 3 is equal to the complement of R, but in this case, R shifted by 3 is {3,5,7,1}, which is the same as the complement of R, which is {1,3,5,7}. So, in this case, R shifted by 3 is the same as the complement of R, so R +3 = R^c. So, yes, R = {0,2,4,6} satisfies R +3 = R^c.

Wait, but earlier, when I tried R = {0,2,4,6}, R shifted by 3 is {3,5,7,1}, which is the complement of R, which is {1,3,5,7}. So, yes, that works. Similarly, R = {1,3,5,7} shifted by 3 gives {4,6,1,2}, which is {1,2,4,6}, which is not the complement of R. Wait, the complement of R is {0,2,4,6}, which isn't the same as {1,2,4,6}. So, perhaps for R = {1,3,5,7}, R +3 is not equal to R^c. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake there.

Wait, no, R = {1,3,5,7} shifted by 3 is {4,6,1,2}, which is {1,2,4,6}, which is not equal to {0,2,4,6}, the complement of R. So, that doesn't work. So, perhaps for R = {0,2,4,6}, shifting by 3 gives R^c. But for R = {1,3,5,7}, shifting by 3 does not give R^c.

Wait, maybe I need to adjust my approach. Perhaps for some values of k, only one subset R satisfies R +k = R^c, while for others, two subsets do. Alternatively, perhaps for each k, there are two subsets R, but some of them are the same as others when considering different k's.

Wait, perhaps the total number of such subsets R is 14, as I thought earlier, but when considering that some subsets are counted multiple times for different k's, perhaps the actual number is less.

Wait, let me think differently. Let me consider that each such subset R that satisfies R +k = R^c for some k is a so-called "symmetric" subset with respect to some shift. How many such subsets are there?

Alternatively, perhaps each such R corresponds to a rotationally symmetric pattern. For example, the subsets {0,2,4,6} and {1,3,5,7} are both symmetric under rotation by 2 positions, as shifting them by 2 gives the same set. So, in this case, these subsets are fixed under a shift of 2. So, for these subsets, shifting by 2 gives the same set, so R +2 = R, which would imply R^c +2 = R^c. But in this case, R +1 = R^c, as we saw earlier.

Hmm, perhaps this is getting too complicated. Let me try to find all such subsets R.

I think the key insight is that for each shift k, there's exactly two subsets R of size 4 such that R +k = R^c. Since there are 7 possible shifts (k=1 to 7), that would give 14 subsets. But wait, when k and 8 are coprime, shifting by k is a generator of the entire group, so perhaps for those shifts, there's only one such R. Hmm, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps I should count the number of such R's by considering the possible rotational symmetries. For each divisor d of 8, there are certain subsets that are periodic with period d.

Wait, another approach: the number of such subsets R is equal to the number of pairs (R, k) where R is a subset of size 4, and R +k = R^c. Since each R is counted once for each k that satisfies the condition, but we want the number of distinct R's, perhaps each R is associated with exactly two values of k. Because if R +k = R^c, then R^c +k = R, so for each R, there are two values of k: k and -k (mod 8). So, perhaps each R is counted twice in the total count.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps for each R, there's exactly one k such that R +k = R^c.

Wait, let me take an example. Let R = {0,2,4,6}. Then, R +1 = {1,3,5,7}, which is R^c. So, k=1 works. Also, if I take R = {1,3,5,7}, then R +1 = {2,4,6,0}, which is R^c. So, for both R and its complement, the same k=1 works.

Similarly, for R = {0,1,4,5}, R +2 = {2,3,6,7}, which is R^c. And for R = {2,3,6,7}, R +2 = {4,5,0,1}, which is R^c. So, again, the same k=2 works for both R and its complement.

So, perhaps for each R, there's exactly one k that works, and for each k, there are two R's (R and R^c) that satisfy the condition R +k = R^c.

So, the total number of such R's would be equal to the number of possible k's times 2, divided by 2 (since each R is counted once for each k that satisfies the condition, but each R is associated with exactly one k). Wait, maybe not.

Wait, let me think differently. For each shift k, how many R's satisfy R +k = R^c?

From the examples, it seems that for each k, there are exactly two R's that satisfy this condition: R and its complement. So, for each of the 7 possible non-zero shifts, we have two R's, leading to 14 subsets R.

But wait, in the case of k=1, R = {0,2,4,6} and R = {1,3,5,7} both satisfy R +1 = R^c. Similarly, for k=2, R = {0,1,4,5} and R = {2,3,6,7} satisfy R +2 = R^c.

Similarly, for k=3, I found that R = {0,2,4,6} satisfies R +3 = R^c because R +3 is {3,5,7,1}, which is the complement of R. So, for k=3, R = {0,2,4,6} is a solution, and its complement R = {1,3,5,7} would also satisfy R +3 = R^c? Let me check:

R = {1,3,5,7} shifted by 3 is {4,6,1,2}, which is {1,2,4,6}, which is not the same as R^c = {0,2,4,6}. So, this doesn't work. Hmm, so perhaps for k=3, only R = {0,2,4,6} satisfies R +3 = R^c.

Wait, but that contradicts the earlier assumption. So, perhaps for some k's, there's only one R that satisfies the condition. Hmm, this complicates things.

Alternatively, perhaps I should model this using group theory. The set of rotations forms a group Z_8. The problem is about finding subsets R where R is a translate of its complement. So, R = R^c +k for some k.

Now, let me think of the subsets as elements of the group algebra. The number of such subsets R would be the number of solutions to R +k = R^c, where R is a subset of size 4.

Wait, perhaps I can model this as a system of equations. For each element x in R, x +k is in R^c. And for each y in R^c, y -k is in R.

This is equivalent to saying that R is a subset such that R +k is exactly R^c.

So, for each such R, the equation R +k = R^c must hold.

Now, considering that R has size 4, R^c also has size 4, so R +k must also have size 4, which it does since R is size 4 and k is a fixed shift.

But how many such R's exist?

Wait, perhaps the number of such subsets R is 14, as I thought before, but let me see.

Wait, let's try to count them:

For k=1:

- R1 = {0,2,4,6}, R1 +1 = {1,3,5,7} = R1^c
- R2 = {1,3,5,7}, R2 +1 = {2,4,6,0} = R2^c

So, two subsets for k=1.

For k=2:

- R3 = {0,1,4,5}, R3 +2 = {2,3,6,7} = R3^c
- R4 = {2,3,6,7}, R4 +2 = {4,5,0,1} = R4^c

Another two subsets.

For k=3:

- R5 = {0,2,4,6}, R5 +3 = {3,5,7,1} = R5^c
- Hmm, but earlier when I checked R = {1,3,5,7}, R +3 was {4,6,1,2}, which isn't R^c. So, perhaps only one subset for k=3.

Wait, but that can't be, because for each k, I would expect two subsets R and R^c that satisfy the condition. But maybe for some k's, R and R^c are the same, which only happens if R is equal to its complement, but that's not possible unless R is empty or the entire set, which isn't the case here.

Wait, perhaps for some k's, only one R exists. Alternatively, perhaps for k=3, the same R = {0,2,4,6} is the only one that works, as R +3 = R^c.

Wait, but then how many total R's do we have?

Wait, perhaps the number of such R's is 14, but when you consider that some R's are counted for multiple k's, so the actual number of unique R's is less.

Wait, maybe it's better to think in terms of the possible symmetries. Each R that's a translate of its complement must be a union of orbits under some rotation.

Wait, alternatively, perhaps each such R corresponds to a pair of complementary subsets that are images of each other under rotation. So, how many such pairs are there?

Wait, but perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me instead think of each such R as a solution to R +k = R^c. So, for a given k, how many R's satisfy this equation?

In the case where k is coprime with 8, say k=1,3,5,7, then the mapping x → x +k is a permutation of the elements, so for each R, R +k is another subset. So, perhaps for each k, there's exactly two subsets R that satisfy R +k = R^c.

Similarly, for k's that are not coprime with 8, like k=2,4,6, the mapping x → x +k is not a permutation, but a bijection within certain orbits.

Wait, perhaps for each k, there are exactly two subsets R of size 4 that satisfy R +k = R^c. So, with k ranging from 1 to 7, that would give 14 subsets R.

But wait, when I checked for k=3, I found that R = {0,2,4,6} satisfies R +3 = R^c, but R = {1,3,5,7} doesn't. So, perhaps for some k's, only one R exists, and for others, two R's exist. So, maybe the total number is not 14, but something else.

Alternatively, perhaps I should model this using the principle of inclusion-exclusion or Burnside's lemma. But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps another way: the number of such R's is equal to the number of pairs (R, k) where R +k = R^c, divided by the number of times each R is counted. Since for each R, there's exactly one k such that R +k = R^c, the total number of such pairs is equal to the number of such R's. So, if for each R, there is exactly one k, then the number of pairs is equal to the number of R's.

Alternatively, perhaps for each R, there's exactly one k such that R +k = R^c.

Wait, let me test this with an example. Take R = {0,2,4,6}. Then, R +1 = {1,3,5,7} = R^c. So, k=1 works. Similarly, R = {0,1,4,5}, R +2 = {2,3,6,7} = R^c, so k=2 works. So, each R is associated with exactly one k.

Similarly, R = {0,3,4,7}, let's see what k would satisfy R +k = R^c. R^c is {1,2,5,6}. Let me see if any k satisfies R +k = {1,2,5,6}. Let me compute R +1 = {1,4,5,0} = {0,1,4,5}, which is not R^c. R +2 = {2,5,6,1} = {1,2,5,6}, which is R^c. So, k=2 works for R = {0,3,4,7}. So, this R is associated with k=2.

Wait, so in this case, for k=2, we have two R's: {0,1,4,5} and {0,3,4,7}? Wait, no, when I took k=2 earlier, R3 was {0,1,4,5}, and R4 was {2,3,6,7}. So, perhaps each k is associated with two R's.

Wait, but in the example I just did, R = {0,3,4,7} is another R where k=2 works. So, perhaps for each k, there are two R's.

Wait, but then how many R's are there in total?

If for each of the 7 possible k's (1 to 7), there are two R's, that would give 14 R's. But when I checked k=3, only one R worked. So, perhaps the total number is 14, but some R's are being double-counted.

Wait, perhaps the answer is that there are 14 such subsets R. Each R has size 4, and each satisfies R +k = R^c for exactly one k.

Thus, the total number of favorable colorings is 14, each corresponding to a unique R, and each R corresponds to exactly one k.

Wait, but each R corresponds to one k, and each k corresponds to two R's. So, if there are 7 k's, each with two R's, that would give 14 R's.

Wait, but when I checked k=3, I found that R = {0,2,4,6} satisfies R +3 = R^c. But R = {1,3,5,7} doesn't satisfy R +3 = R^c. So, perhaps for k=3, only one R exists. Hmm, this contradicts the earlier assumption.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in my earlier calculation. Let me check again.

R = {0,2,4,6}, k=3: R +3 = {3,5,7,1}, which is the same as {1,3,5,7}, which is R^c. So, yes, that works.

R = {1,3,5,7}, k=3: R +3 = {4,6,1,2}, which is {1,2,4,6}, which is not equal to R^c, which is {0,2,4,6}. So, that doesn't work.

So, for k=3, only R = {0,2,4,6} works. So, perhaps for some k's, only one R exists, while for others, two R's exist.

Wait, let me check for k=4.

If k=4, then R +4 = R^c.

Let me take R = {0,1,2,3}. Then R +4 = {4,5,6,7} = R^c. So, that works. Similarly, R = {4,5,6,7} would have R +4 = {0,1,2,3} = R^c. So, for k=4, two R's satisfy R +4 = R^c.

Similarly, for k=5:

Let me take R = {0,2,4,6}, R +5 = {5,7,1,3} = {1,3,5,7} = R^c. So, that works. Similarly, R = {1,3,5,7}, R +5 = {6,8,10,12} mod8 → {6,0,2,4} = {0,2,4,6} = R^c. So, that works too. So, for k=5, two R's work.

Similarly, for k=6:

Let me take R = {0,1,4,5}, R +6 = {6,7,10,11} mod8 → {6,7,2,3} = {2,3,6,7} = R^c. So, that works. Similarly, R = {2,3,6,7}, R +6 = {8,9,12,13} mod8 → {0,1,4,5} = R^c. So, that works too. So, for k=6, two R's work.

For k=7:

Let me take R = {0,2,4,6}, R +7 = {7, 9, 11, 13} mod8 → {7,1,3,5} = {1,3,5,7} = R^c. So, that works. Similarly, R = {1,3,5,7}, R +7 = {8,10,12,14} mod8 → {0,2,4,6} = R^c. So, that works too. So, for k=7, two R's work.

Wait, but for k=3, I only found one R that worked. So, perhaps the count isn't uniform across all k's.

Wait, let me list all the R's I found so far:

For k=1:

- R1 = {0,2,4,6}
- R2 = {1,3,5,7}

For k=2:

- R3 = {0,1,4,5}
- R4 = {2,3,6,7}

For k=3:

- R5 = {0,2,4,6} (same as R1)

For k=4:

- R6 = {0,1,2,3}
- R7 = {4,5,6,7}

For k=5:

- R8 = {0,2,4,6} (same as R1)
- R9 = {1,3,5,7} (same as R2)

For k=6:

- R10 = {0,1,4,5} (same as R3)
- R11 = {2,3,6,7} (same as R4)

For k=7:

- R12 = {0,2,4,6} (same as R1)
- R13 = {1,3,5,7} (same as R2)

Wait, so actually, for k=3, the only R that works is R1, which was already counted under k=1. Similarly, for k=5, the R's are R1 and R2, which were already counted. Same for k=7.

So, in reality, the only distinct R's that satisfy R +k = R^c for some k are:

- R1 = {0,2,4,6}
- R2 = {1,3,5,7}
- R3 = {0,1,4,5}
- R4 = {2,3,6,7}
- R6 = {0,1,2,3}
- R7 = {4,5,6,7}

Wait, let me check if R6 and R7 are valid.

R6 = {0,1,2,3}, k=4: R6 +4 = {4,5,6,7} = R6^c. Yes, that works.

Similarly, R7 = {4,5,6,7}, k=4: R7 +4 = {0,1,2,3} = R7^c. That works.

So, so far, I have six distinct R's:

1. {0,2,4,6}
2. {1,3,5,7}
3. {0,1,4,5}
4. {2,3,6,7}
5. {0,1,2,3}
6. {4,5,6,7}

Are there any more?

Let me check another R. Let me take R = {0,1,5,6}.

Check if there's a k such that R +k = R^c.

R^c = {2,3,4,7}.

Let's try k=2:

R +2 = {2,3,7,0} = {0,2,3,7}, which is not equal to R^c.

k=3:

R +3 = {3,4,8,9} mod8 → {3,4,0,1} = {0,1,3,4}, which is not R^c.

k=4:

R +4 = {4,5,9,10} mod8 → {4,5,1,2} = {1,2,4,5}, which is not R^c.

k=5:

R +5 = {5,6,10,11} mod8 → {5,6,2,3} = {2,3,5,6}, which is not R^c.

k=6:

R +6 = {6,7,11,12} mod8 → {6,7,3,4} = {3,4,6,7}, which is not R^c.

k=7:

R +7 = {7,8,12,13} mod8 → {7,0,4,5} = {0,4,5,7}, which is not R^c.

So, R = {0,1,5,6} doesn't seem to satisfy R +k = R^c for any k. So, perhaps this R is not among the favorable ones.

Similarly, R = {0,3,5,7}:

R^c = {1,2,4,6}.

Check k=3: R +3 = {3,6,8,10} mod8 → {3,6,0,2} = {0,2,3,6}, which is not R^c.

k=1: R +1 = {1,4,6,0} = {0,1,4,6}, which is not R^c.

k=2: R +2 = {2,5,7,1} = {1,2,5,7}, which is not R^c.

Hmm, no luck there either.

So, perhaps the only R's that satisfy R +k = R^c are the six I found earlier. So, that would give us six subsets R of size 4.

Wait, but wait, I thought for k=1,2,4,5,6,7, we had some R's, but it seems like each k beyond 3 either gives us R's that have already been counted or don't work.

So, perhaps the total number of such R's is six.

Wait, but earlier when I thought about k=3, I found that R1 = {0,2,4,6} works, but R2 doesn't. So, perhaps R1 is already counted under k=1, and R2 doesn't work for k=3.

So, in total, I found six subsets R that satisfy R +k = R^c for some k, with each R being unique. So, that would mean the number of favorable colorings is 6.

But wait, each R corresponds to a unique coloring where exactly four vertices are red and four are blue, and the set of red vertices is R. So, each R corresponds to exactly one coloring where R is red and R^c is blue.

So, the total number of favorable colorings is 6.

Wait, but that seems low. Because the number of colorings where the blue set is a rotation of the red set should be more than six.

Wait, wait, no, because each such R corresponds to exactly one coloring. So, with six R's, the number of favorable colorings is six.

But earlier, I thought that for each R, there are two colorings (R and R^c), but since R and R^c are both counted, perhaps the total number is 12, but considering that some R's are their own complements, but that's impossible for size 4 in 8 elements.

Wait, no, because R and R^c are distinct unless R is equal to its complement, which isn't possible for size 4 in 8 elements. So, for each R, R^c is a different subset. So, if I have six R's, that would correspond to 12 subsets, but when considering that R and R^c are both counted, perhaps the total number is 12/2 = 6 unique colorings.

Wait, perhaps not. Let me think again.

Each R corresponds to a unique coloring where R is red and R^c is blue. So, if there are six such R's, then there are six such colorings.

But earlier, I found that for each k, there are two R's, but when considering overlaps, the total number of unique R's is six.

Wait, but earlier, I saw that for k=1, two R's; k=2, two R's; k=4, two R's. So, that's six R's. And for other k's, the R's were duplicates of these.

So, perhaps the total number of such R's is six, each corresponding to a unique coloring.

So, the number of favorable colorings is six.

Wait, but let me confirm this.

Wait, R1 = {0,2,4,6}: coloring is R1 red, R1^c blue.

R2 = {1,3,5,7}: coloring is R2 red, R2^c blue.

R3 = {0,1,4,5}: coloring is R3 red, R3^c blue.

R4 = {2,3,6,7}: coloring is R4 red, R4^c blue.

R5 = {0,1,2,3}: coloring is R5 red, R5^c blue.

R6 = {4,5,6,7}: coloring is R6 red, R6^c blue.

So, six colorings in total.

Thus, the probability is 6 / 256, which simplifies to 3 / 128.

Wait, but wait, in the problem statement, it's about the probability that the octagon can be rotated so that all blue vertices end up where there were originally red vertices. So, in other words, for a given coloring, the set of blue vertices is a rotation of the set of red vertices. So, each such coloring corresponds to a subset R where R is a translate of R^c, as we've been discussing.

So, if there are six such subsets R, then the number of favorable colorings is six.

But wait, each R corresponds to exactly one coloring, as the red set is R and blue is R^c.

So, the number of favorable colorings is six, each with probability (1/2)^8 = 1/256.

So, the probability is 6 * (1/256) = 6/256 = 3/128.

But wait, let me think again. The problem says that the octagon can be rotated so that all blue vertices end up where originally red were. So, for a given coloring, if the blue set is a translate of the red set, then it's favorable.

So, the number of favorable colorings is the number of ordered pairs (R, k) where R is a subset of size 4, and R +k = R^c, divided by 2 because each coloring is counted twice (once as R and once as R^c), but wait, no, actually, each R corresponds to a unique coloring where R is red and R^c is blue.

Wait, but earlier, I found six such R's, each corresponding to a unique coloring. So, the total number of favorable colorings is six.

But wait, in the earlier examples, for each k, two R's are possible. But when considering that shifting R by k gives R^c, each such R is unique. So, perhaps the total number of R's is indeed 14, but some R's are duplicates when considering different k's.

Wait, this is getting confusing. Let me try another approach. Let me count the number of such R's using Burnside's lemma, which counts the number of orbits under a group action.

Wait, the group in question is the cyclic group Z_8, acting on the subsets of size 4. We're looking for the number of subsets R where R is a translate of R^c.

Wait, but perhaps using Burnside's lemma would help here. Burnside's lemma says that the number of orbits is equal to the average number of fixed points of the group elements.

But I'm not sure if that's the right approach here. Alternatively, perhaps it's better to accept that the number of such R's is 14, but when considering that each R is counted twice (once for k and once for -k), the actual number is 7. But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps it's better to look up how many such subsets exist. I think for a cyclic group of order 8, the number of subsets R of size 4 such that R is a translate of R^c is 14. But I'm not entirely sure.

Alternatively, perhaps I can compute the number of such R's by considering that for each rotation k, there are two R's, except for some symmetries.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to think in terms of the number of possible rotational symmetries. Since the octagon has 8 rotational symmetries (including identity), and for each symmetry (rotation by k positions), the number of R's fixed by that rotation is 2 for k=0 (the identity), but that's not helpful here.

Wait, perhaps I should just accept that the number of such R's is 14, leading to 14 favorable colorings, each with probability 1/256, so the total probability is 14/256 = 7/128.

Wait, but earlier, I thought the number was six, but that might have been a mistake.

Wait, perhaps the correct count is 14. Let me think: for each of the 7 non-zero rotations k, there are two R's, giving 14 R's. So, the number of favorable colorings is 14, each with probability 1/256. So, the probability is 14/256 = 7/128.

But wait, let me check again. When I considered k=3, only one R worked. So, perhaps the count isn't 14, but something else.

Alternatively, perhaps the number of such R's is 14, but some of them are duplicates when considering different k's. For example, R1 = {0,2,4,6} works for k=1, k=5, k=7, etc.

Wait, but when I considered k=1, R1 worked, and when I considered k=5, R1 also worked. So, R1 is being counted multiple times for different k's. So, the total number of unique R's would be less than 14.

So, perhaps the correct count is 6 unique R's, each corresponding to a unique coloring.

Wait, but earlier I found six R's, each for different k's, but perhaps each R corresponds to multiple k's.

Wait, perhaps each R is a solution for multiple k's. For example, R1 = {0,2,4,6} works for k=1,3,5,7.

Similarly, R2 = {1,3,5,7} works for k=1,3,5,7.

Wait, let me check R1 for k=3: R1 +3 = {3,5,7,1} = R1^c, which is correct.

Similarly, R1 +5 = {5,7,1,3} = R1^c.

R1 +7 = {7,1,3,5} = R1^c.

So, R1 works for k=1,3,5,7.

Similarly, R2 works for k=1,3,5,7.

Similarly, R3 = {0,1,4,5}:

R3 +2 = {2,3,6,7} = R3^c

R3 +6 = {6,7,10,11} mod8 → {6,7,2,3} = R3^c

So, R3 works for k=2 and k=6.

Similarly, R4 = {2,3,6,7} works for k=2 and k=6.

Similarly, R5 = {0,1,2,3} works for k=4.

R6 = {4,5,6,7} works for k=4.

So, in total, how many unique R's do we have?

Looking at this, R1 and R2 are each counted for four different k's each.

R3 and R4 are each counted for two different k's each.

R5 and R6 are each counted for one k.

So, the unique R's are:

- R1: {0,2,4,6}
- R2: {1,3,5,7}
- R3: {0,1,4,5}
- R4: {2,3,6,7}
- R5: {0,1,2,3}
- R6: {4,5,6,7}

So, that's six unique R's.

Each R1 and R2 work for four k's each, R3 and R4 work for two k's each, and R5 and R6 work for one k each.

So, the total number of (R, k) pairs is 4 (for R1) +4 (for R2) +2 (for R3) +2 (for R4) +1 (for R5) +1 (for R6) = 14.

So, there are 14 such (R, k) pairs, but only six unique R's.

Therefore, the number of favorable colorings is six, each corresponding to a unique R.

Wait, no. Each R corresponds to a unique coloring, regardless of how many k's satisfy R +k = R^c. So, each R gives exactly one favorable coloring.

Thus, the number of favorable colorings is six, each corresponding to a unique R.

Therefore, the probability is 6 / 256 = 3 / 128.

Wait, but this contradicts my earlier thought that there are 14 favorable colorings. So, I'm confused.

Alternatively, perhaps each R corresponds to multiple colorings. Wait, no, each R is a specific subset, so each R corresponds to exactly one coloring where R is red and R^c is blue.

Thus, if there are six such R's, the probability is 6/256 = 3/128.

But let me check another way.

The problem is about the probability that there exists a rotation k such that all blue vertices after rotation are on the original red positions.

Which is equivalent to saying that the blue set is a translate of the red set.

So, the number of such colorings is equal to the number of ordered pairs (R, k) where R is a subset of size 4, and R +k = R^c.

But each such coloring is determined by R, as the blue set is R^c, and R must satisfy R +k = R^c for some k.

So, each R that satisfies this condition corresponds to exactly one coloring.

Thus, the number of favorable colorings is equal to the number of such R's.

From the earlier analysis, we have six such R's. So, the number of favorable colorings is six.

So, the probability is 6/256 = 3/128.

Thus, the answer would be m + n = 3 + 128 = 131.

Wait, but I'm not entirely confident because earlier I thought the count might be 14. But perhaps I'm missing something.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in counting the R's. Let me try to list all possible R's that satisfy R +k = R^c for some k.

From earlier:

1. R1 = {0,2,4,6}: works for k=1,3,5,7
2. R2 = {1,3,5,7}: works for k=1,3,5,7
3. R3 = {0,1,4,5}: works for k=2,6
4. R4 = {2,3,6,7}: works for k=2,6
5. R5 = {0,1,2,3}: works for k=4
6. R6 = {4,5,6,7}: works for k=4

So, that's six R's. Each of these R's is unique, and each corresponds to exactly one coloring where R is red and R^c is blue.

Thus, the number of favorable colorings is six, so the probability is 6/256 = 3/128.

Therefore, m = 3, n = 128, and m + n = 131.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The probability is $\boxed{131}$.
