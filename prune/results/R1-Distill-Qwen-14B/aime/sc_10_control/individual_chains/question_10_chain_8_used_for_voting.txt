Alright, so I came across this math problem, and I thought I'd try to work through it step by step. Let's see what it's about. The problem goes like this:

Alice chooses a set A of positive integers. Then Bob lists all finite nonempty sets B of positive integers with the property that the maximum element of B belongs to A. Bob's list has 2024 sets. Find the sum of the elements of A.

Hmm, okay. So, Alice picks a set A, and Bob creates a list of all finite nonempty sets B where the maximum element of B is in A. The total number of such sets B is 2024. We need to find the sum of the elements in A.

Let me try to break this down. So, Bob is listing sets B such that each B is finite, nonempty, and the maximum element of B is in A. So, for each element a in A, Bob can create sets B where a is the maximum. The number of such sets for each a would be the number of subsets of the positive integers less than a, including the empty set, but since B has to be nonempty, we subtract one.

Wait, actually, no. For each a in A, the number of possible sets B where a is the maximum would be the number of subsets of the set {1, 2, ..., a-1}, because B can include any combination of numbers less than a, as long as a is included. But since B is nonempty, and a is included, the number of subsets would be 2^{a-1}. Because each element less than a can be either included or excluded, and a must be included.

So, for each a in A, the number of sets B with max element a is 2^{a-1}. Therefore, the total number of such sets B is the sum over all a in A of 2^{a-1}.

And according to the problem, this total is 2024. So, we have:

Sum_{a in A} 2^{a - 1} = 2024.

Our goal is to find the sum of elements in A, which is Sum_{a in A} a.

So, the problem reduces to finding a set A of positive integers such that the sum of 2^{a-1} for each a in A equals 2024. Then, once we find such an A, we compute the sum of its elements.

This seems similar to binary representations because powers of two are involved. Let me think about this.

In binary, each number can be represented as a sum of distinct powers of two. Here, the sum is 2024, which is a specific number, and each term is 2^{a-1}, so each a corresponds to a bit in the binary representation.

Wait, that might be the case. If A is a set of integers where each a corresponds to an exponent in the binary representation of 2024, then the sum of 2^{a-1} would be 2024.

But let's test this idea. Let me write 2024 in binary.

First, 2024 divided by 2: 2024 /2 = 1012, remainder 0.

1012 /2 = 506, rem 0.

506 /2 = 253, rem 0.

253 /2 = 126 rem 1.

126 /2 =63 rem 0.

63 /2=31 rem1.

31/2=15 rem1.

15/2=7 rem1.

7/2=3 rem1.

3/2=1 rem1.

1/2=0 rem1.

So writing the remainders from last to first: 11111101000.

Wait, let me verify:

Calculating 11111101000 in binary: Let's compute the value.

From right, the positions are 0 to 10.

Positions where there is a 1:

From the right: positions 3, 5, 6,7,8,9,10.

Wait, let me count the binary digits:

The binary number is 11111101000.

Breaking it down:

1 * 2^10 = 1024

1 * 2^9 = 512

1 * 2^8 =256

1 * 2^7=128

1 * 2^6=64

1 * 2^5=32

0 * 2^4=0

1 * 2^3=8

0 * 2^2=0

0 * 2^1=0

0 * 2^0=0

Adding them up: 1024 +512=1536; +256=1792; +128=1920; +64=1984; +32=2016; +8=2024. Yep, that's correct.

So, 2024 in binary is 11111101000, which has 1s at positions 3,5,6,7,8,9,10.

Wait, but in terms of bits, the rightmost is position 0. So let me list the positions with 1s:

Starting from the right:

Position 3: 8 (2^3)

Position 5: 32 (2^5)

Position 6:64 (2^6)

Position7:128

Position8:256

Position9:512

Position10:1024

So, the exponents are 3,5,6,7,8,9,10.

But wait, in the sum Sum_{a in A} 2^{a -1} = 2024, each term is 2^{a-1}, so each a corresponds to an exponent in the binary representation of 2024, but shifted by 1.

Wait, let me think again.

If 2024 is expressed as the sum of 2^{k_i}, then each k_i is such that 2^{k_i} is a term in the sum. But in our case, the sum is Sum 2^{a-1}, so each term is 2^{a-1}. So 2^{a-1}=2^{k_i}, which implies that a-1 =k_i, so a=k_i +1.

Therefore, each a in A is one more than the exponents present in the binary representation of 2024.

Wait, but 2024 is 2^10 + 2^9 + 2^8 + 2^7 + 2^6 + 2^5 + 2^3, right? Let me check:

2^10=1024

2^9=512 → 1024+512=1536

2^8=256 → 1792

2^7=128 →1920

2^6=64 →1984

2^5=32 →2016

2^3=8 →2024.

So exponents are 3,5,6,7,8,9,10.

So, for each exponent k_i, a = k_i +1.

Thus, a_i are 4,6,7,8,9,10,11.

Wait, that's 7 elements.

So, the set A would be {4,6,7,8,9,10,11}.

Then the sum of elements in A is 4 +6 +7 +8 +9 +10 +11.

Let me compute that:

4+6=10

10+7=17

17+8=25

25+9=34

34+10=44

44+11=55.

So the sum would be 55.

Wait, but let me double-check because I might have made a mistake in the correspondence between the binary representation and the exponents.

Wait, because in the binary representation, 2024 is the sum of 2^k, where k is 3,5,6,7,8,9,10.

But in our problem, the sum is Sum_{a in A} 2^{a-1} = 2024.

So, each 2^{a-1} is equal to a power of two. So, 2^{a-1} = 2^k, so a-1=k, so a=k+1.

Therefore, each a in A is one more than the exponents present in the binary decomposition of 2024.

Since 2024 is 2^3 +2^5 +2^6 +2^7 +2^8 +2^9 +2^10, the exponents are 3,5,6,7,8,9,10.

Thus, a is 4,6,7,8,9,10,11.

So, the set A is {4,6,7,8,9,10,11}.

Sum of A is 4+6+7+8+9+10+11.

Let me calculate that:

4 +6 =10

10+7=17

17+8=25

25+9=34

34+10=44

44+11=55.

So the sum is 55.

Wait, but let me think again. Is the correspondence correct? Because in the binary decomposition, each term is a distinct power of two. So each a-1 is an exponent in that decomposition, and a is one more than that exponent.

But in our problem, the sum is Sum 2^{a-1} =2024, so each 2^{a-1} must correspond to a term in the binary decomposition. Therefore, each a-1 is an exponent present in 2024's binary representation, and each a is one more than that exponent.

So yes, if the binary decompositions have exponents 3,5,6,7,8,9,10, then a is 4,6,7,8,9,10,11.

So the set A has those elements, and the sum is 55.

But wait, another thought: could there be a different set A that gives the same sum?

In other words, is 2024 uniquely expressible as a sum of distinct 2^{a-1} terms?

I think yes. Because each power of two is unique and the binary representation is unique. So, the set A is uniquely determined.

Therefore, sum of A is 55.

Wait, but I should make sure. Let me think if there's another way to express 2024 as a sum of 2^{a-1} terms.

Suppose I try to find another combination of a's such that the sum of 2^{a-1} is 2024. For example, maybe using a=4, which contributes 8, a=5, which contributes 16, etc.

Wait, but that's similar to the binary decomposition but with a shift. Let me think.

Wait, another approach: perhaps 2024 is equal to 2^11 - something? Wait, 2^11 is 2048. 2048-2024=24. So 2024=2048-24. But I'm not sure if that helps.

Alternatively, perhaps thinking of 2024 as 1024 + 512 + 256 + 128 +64 +32 +8=2024, which are the terms I mentioned before.

So, in terms of 2^{a-1}, they correspond to exponents 3,5,6,7,8,9,10.

So, a is 4,6,7,8,9,10,11.

So, their sum is 55.

Alternatively, perhaps if some a's are missing and others are larger, but I don't think that's possible because 2024 has a unique binary representation, so the set A must correspond exactly to the exponents plus one.

So, I think the answer is 55. But just to make sure, let me see:

Sum_{a in A} 2^{a-1} = 2^{3} +2^{5}+2^{6}+2^{7}+2^{8}+2^{9}+2^{10}=8 +32 +64 +128 +256 +512 +1024= indeed 2024.

Yes, that's correct.

So, the sum of elements in A is 4+6+7+8+9+10+11=55.

Therefore, the answer should be 55.

Alice chooses a set \( A \) of positive integers. Bob then lists all finite nonempty sets \( B \) of positive integers where the maximum element of \( B \) is in \( A \). The total number of such sets \( B \) is 2024. We need to find the sum of the elements of \( A \).

For each element \( a \) in \( A \), the number of finite nonempty sets \( B \) where \( a \) is the maximum element is \( 2^{a-1} \). This is because each \( B \) can include any combination of the integers less than \( a \), as long as \( a \) is included. Therefore, the total number of such sets \( B \) is given by the sum:

\[
\sum_{a \in A} 2^{a-1} = 2024
\]

To solve this, we express 2024 in binary. The binary representation of 2024 is \( 11111101000 \), which corresponds to the sum of powers of two:

\[
2024 = 2^{10} + 2^9 + 2^8 + 2^7 + 2^6 + 2^5 + 2^3
\]

Each term \( 2^{a-1} \) in the sum corresponds to a power of two in this decomposition. Therefore, \( a - 1 \) is the exponent in each term, so \( a \) is one more than each exponent. The exponents present are 3, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, and 10. Thus, the elements of \( A \) are:

\[
A = \{4, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11\}
\]

The sum of the elements of \( A \) is:

\[
4 + 6 + 7 + 8 + 9 + 10 + 11 = 55
\]

Therefore, the sum of the elements of \( A \) is \(\boxed{55}\).
