Okay, let me try to solve this geometry problem. So, we have triangle ABC inscribed in a circle ω. The tangents at B and C meet at D, and the line AD intersects ω again at P. We need to find the length AP, given AB=5, BC=9, and AC=10.

Hmm, I remember that when dealing with tangents to a circle, the lengths from the external point to the points of tangency are equal. So, since D is the intersection of the tangents at B and C, DB and DC should be equal. That might come in handy later.

First, maybe I should sketch the triangle and the circle to get a better visual. But since I don't have paper right now, I'll try to imagine it. Triangle ABC with AB=5, BC=9, AC=10. Let me check if this is a valid triangle. The sum of any two sides should be greater than the third. 5+9=14>10, 5+10=15>9, 9+10=19>5. Yep, valid.

Now, I need to find AP. Since P is the intersection of AD with ω again, maybe some power of a point theorem can be used here. Wait, power of a point D with respect to ω. Since D is the intersection of the tangents at B and C, the power of D with respect to ω is DB² = DC². Power of a point formula says that for any point outside the circle, the power is equal to the square of the tangent length. So, Power(D) = DB² = DC².

Also, AD is a secant that intersects ω at A and P. So, by the power of point D, we have:

DB² = DA * DP

Because Power(D) = DB² = DA * DP.

So, if I can find DB and express DA in terms of AP, maybe I can solve for AP.

Wait, but I don't know DA yet. Let me think.

First, perhaps I should compute the circumradius of triangle ABC. Since the triangle is inscribed in ω, the circumradius R can be found using the formula:

R = (a * b * c) / (4 * Δ)

Where a, b, c are the sides, and Δ is the area of the triangle.

Given sides AB=5, BC=9, AC=10. Let's compute the area using Heron's formula.

First, compute the semi-perimeter s:

s = (5 + 9 + 10)/2 = (24)/2 = 12.

Then, area Δ = sqrt[s(s - a)(s - b)(s - c)] = sqrt[12*(12-5)*(12-9)*(12-10)] = sqrt[12*7*3*2] = sqrt[504] = sqrt[16*31.5] = Wait, maybe compute it more accurately.

12*7=84, 84*3=252, 252*2=504. So sqrt(504). Let me see: 504=16*31.5? Wait, 16*31.5 is 504, but 31.5 is not a perfect square. Alternatively, 504=16*31.5=16* (9*3.5)=16*9*3.5=144*3.5. Hmm, maybe 504= 72*7, since 72*7=504. So sqrt(504)=sqrt(72*7)=sqrt(36*2*7)=6*sqrt(14). So Δ=6√14.

So the area is 6√14. Then the circumradius R is (5*9*10)/(4*6√14) = (450)/(24√14) = simplify numerator and denominator: 450/24 = 75/4. So R = (75)/(4√14). Rationalize the denominator: multiply numerator and denominator by √14: (75√14)/(4*14) = (75√14)/56. So R = 75√14 / 56.

Okay, so now what? Maybe we can find DB in terms of R? Since D is the ex-tangent point, the distance from D to the center should be related, but maybe that's too complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps using coordinate geometry? Let me consider placing the triangle in coordinate system to compute coordinates.

Let me place point C at the origin (0,0), point A at (10,0), and point B somewhere in the plane. Then, I can compute coordinates of B, then find the equation of the circumcircle, find the point D where the tangents at B and C meet, then find the equation of AD, find its intersection with ω (point P), then compute the length AP.

Hmm, that seems involved, but maybe manageable.

First, let's find the coordinates of point B.

Given triangle ABC with AB=5, BC=9, AC=10. Points A(10,0), C(0,0). Let B be at (x,y). Then, distance from B to A is 5: sqrt[(x-10)^2 + y^2] =5, so (x-10)^2 + y^2=25.

Distance from B to C is 9: sqrt[x^2 + y^2]=9, so x² + y²=81.

Subtracting the two equations: (x² + y²) - [(x -10)^2 + y²] = 81 -25 → x² - (x² -20x +100) =56 → 20x -100 =56 → 20x=156 →x=156/20=39/5=7.8.

Then, substituting x=39/5 into x² + y²=81:

(39/5)^2 + y²=81 → (1521/25) + y²=81 → y²=81 - 1521/25= (2025/25 -1521/25)=504/25 → y=±sqrt(504)/5=±(6√14)/5. Since the triangle is drawn, let's take y positive, so B is at (39/5, 6√14/5).

So, coordinates:

A(10,0), B(39/5, 6√14/5), C(0,0).

Now, find the circumcircle equation. Since points A, B, C lie on the circle, we can find its equation.

The general equation of a circle is x² + y² + Dx + Ey + F=0.

Plugging in point C(0,0): 0 +0 +0 +0 +F=0 → F=0.

So the equation becomes x² + y² + Dx + Ey=0.

Plugging in point A(10,0): 100 +0 +10D +0=0 → 100 +10D=0 → D= -10.

So equation: x² + y² -10x + Ey=0.

Now, plug in point B(39/5, 6√14/5):

(39/5)² + (6√14/5)^2 -10*(39/5) + E*(6√14/5)=0.

Compute each term:

(39/5)^2 = (1521)/25.

(6√14/5)^2 = (36*14)/25=504/25.

-10*(39/5)= -78.

So equation becomes:

1521/25 +504/25 -78 + (6√14/5)E=0.

Combine the fractions:

(1521 +504)/25 =2025/25=81.

So 81 -78 + (6√14/5)E=0 → 3 + (6√14/5)E=0 → (6√14/5)E= -3 → E= (-3)*(5)/(6√14)= (-15)/(6√14)= (-5)/(2√14). Rationalize: (-5√14)/(2*14)= (-5√14)/28.

So E= -5√14/28.

Therefore, the equation of the circle is x² + y² -10x - (5√14/28)y=0.

Alternatively, we can write it in standard form by completing the squares.

x² -10x + y² - (5√14/28)y =0.

Completing the square for x:

x² -10x = (x -5)^2 -25.

For y:

y² - (5√14/28)y = [y - (5√14/(56))]^2 - (5√14/(56))².

Wait, let me compute that again.

The coefficient of y is -(5√14)/28. Half of that is -(5√14)/56. Squared is (25*14)/(56²)=350/(3136)=25/224.

So, the equation becomes:

(x -5)^2 -25 + [y - (5√14/56)]^2 -25/224=0.

Bring constants to the other side:

(x-5)^2 + [y - (5√14/56)]^2 =25 +25/224= (25*224 +25)/224=25*(224 +1)/224=25*225/224=5625/224.

So the circle has center at (5, 5√14/56) and radius sqrt(5625/224)=75/sqrt(224)=75/(2*sqrt(56))=75/(2*2*sqrt(14))=75/(4√14)= same as earlier, R=75√14/56. Which matches our earlier calculation. Good.

Now, we need to find the point D where the tangents at B and C meet.

The tangent at point C is easy since C is at (0,0). The tangent at C is perpendicular to the radius OC, where O is the center (5,5√14/56).

Wait, but in coordinate terms, the tangent at point C(0,0) can be found using the equation of the circle. The equation is x² + y² -10x - (5√14/28)y =0. The tangent at (x1,y1) on the circle is given by xx1 + yy1 + D*(x +x1)/2 + E*(y + y1)/2 + F=0.

Wait, alternatively, for a circle in general equation x² + y² + Dx + Ey + F=0, the tangent at (x1, y1) is xx1 + yy1 + D*(x +x1)/2 + E*(y + y1)/2 + F=0.

So for point C(0,0), the tangent equation is:

x*0 + y*0 + D*(x +0)/2 + E*(y +0)/2 + F=0.

But F=0, so it's (Dx)/2 + (Ey)/2=0.

Substituting D=-10 and E=-5√14/28:

(-10x)/2 + (-5√14 y)/56=0 → -5x - (5√14 y)/56=0 → Multiply both sides by 56 to eliminate denominators:

-280x -5√14 y=0 → 280x +5√14 y=0.

Divide both sides by 5:

56x +√14 y=0.

So the tangent at C is 56x +√14 y=0.

Similarly, find the tangent at B(39/5, 6√14/5).

Using the same formula: for point (x1,y1), the tangent equation is xx1 + yy1 + D*(x +x1)/2 + E*(y + y1)/2 + F=0.

So plug in x1=39/5, y1=6√14/5, D=-10, E=-5√14/28, F=0.

Equation becomes:

x*(39/5) + y*(6√14/5) + (-10)(x +39/5)/2 + (-5√14/28)(y +6√14/5)/2 = 0.

Let me compute each term step by step.

First term: (39/5)x.

Second term: (6√14/5)y.

Third term: (-10/2)(x +39/5) = (-5)(x +39/5) = -5x -39.

Fourth term: (-5√14/28)/2 (y +6√14/5) = (-5√14/56)(y +6√14/5) = (-5√14 y)/56 - (5√14 *6√14)/(56*5).

Compute the fourth term:

(-5√14 y)/56 - (5*6*14)/(56*5) → because √14 *√14 =14, and 5 cancels in numerator and denominator.

Simplify:

(-5√14 y)/56 - (30*14)/(56*5).

Wait, 5 in numerator and denominator cancels, leaving 30/56 *14.

Wait, let me compute (5√14 *6√14)/(56*5):

The 5 cancels. So 6√14 *√14 =6*14=84. So it's 84/56= 3/2.

So the fourth term is (-5√14 y)/56 - 3/2.

Putting all terms together:

(39/5)x + (6√14/5)y -5x -39 + (-5√14 y)/56 -3/2=0.

Combine like terms.

First, x terms:

(39/5)x -5x = (39/5 -25/5)x = (14/5)x.

y terms:

(6√14/5)y - (5√14/56)y = let's compute coefficients:

6√14/5 = (6*56√14)/(5*56)= 336√14/280.

5√14/56 = (5*5√14)/(56*5)=25√14/280.

So 336√14/280 -25√14/280 = 311√14/280.

Wait, is that right? Wait, no. Actually, 6√14/5 = (6*56√14)/(5*56) = (336√14)/280.

Similarly, 5√14/56= (25√14)/280.

So, 336√14/280 -25√14/280 = 311√14/280.

So the y coefficient is 311√14/280.

Constant terms:

-39 -3/2 = -(39 + 1.5)= -40.5= -81/2.

So the equation becomes:

(14/5)x + (311√14/280)y -81/2=0.

Multiply both sides by 280 to eliminate denominators:

14/5 x *280 =14*56x=784x.

311√14 y remains as is.

-81/2 *280 = -81*140= -11340.

So the equation is:

784x + 311√14 y -11340=0.

So, the tangent at B is 784x + 311√14 y =11340.

Now, we have two tangent equations: tangent at C is 56x +√14 y=0, and tangent at B is 784x +311√14 y=11340.

We need to find their intersection point D.

So, solve the system:

56x +√14 y=0 ...(1)

784x +311√14 y=11340 ...(2)

Let me solve equation (1) for y: y= (-56x)/√14.

Simplify: y= (-56/√14) x = (-56√14)/(14) x = (-4√14)x.

So, y= -4√14 x.

Now, plug this into equation (2):

784x +311√14*(-4√14 x)=11340.

Compute 311√14 * (-4√14 x):

311*(-4)*(√14)^2 x= -1244*14 x= -17416 x.

So equation becomes:

784x -17416x =11340 → (784 -17416)x=11340 → (-16632)x=11340 → x= 11340/(-16632)= simplify.

Divide numerator and denominator by 12: 945/(-1386).

Divide by 3: 315/(-462).

Divide by 21: 15/(-22). So x= -15/22.

Then, y= -4√14*(-15/22)= (60√14)/22= (30√14)/11.

So, point D is at (-15/22, 30√14/11).

Now, we need to find the equation of line AD.

Point A is at (10,0), point D is at (-15/22, 30√14/11).

Compute the slope of AD:

m= (30√14/11 -0)/(-15/22 -10)= (30√14/11)/(-15/22 - 220/22)= (30√14/11)/(-235/22)= (30√14/11)*( -22/235 )= -60√14 /235 = -12√14 /47.

So, slope m= -12√14/47.

Equation of AD: y -0= m(x -10) → y= (-12√14/47)(x -10).

Now, find the intersection point P of AD with ω, other than A.

We have the circle equation: x² + y² -10x - (5√14/28)y=0.

Substitute y from AD into the circle equation.

So, y= (-12√14/47)(x -10).

Let me denote this as y= m(x -10), where m= -12√14/47.

Substitute into the circle equation:

x² + [m(x -10)]² -10x - (5√14/28)[m(x -10)] =0.

Compute each term.

First, x².

Second term: [m(x -10)]²= m²(x² -20x +100).

Third term: -10x.

Fourth term: -(5√14/28)*m*(x -10).

So, the equation becomes:

x² + m²x² -20 m²x +100 m² -10x - (5√14 m /28)(x -10)=0.

Combine like terms:

(1 + m²)x² + (-20 m² -10 -5√14 m /28 )x + (100 m² + 50√14 m /28)=0.

This is a quadratic in x. We know that x=10 is a root because point A is on both AD and ω. So, we can factor out (x -10).

Let me denote the quadratic as:

A x² + B x + C=0,

where:

A=1 + m²,

B= -20 m² -10 - (5√14 m)/28,

C=100 m² + (50√14 m)/28.

Since x=10 is a root, we can factor it as (x -10)(something)=0.

Let me perform polynomial division or use the factor theorem.

Alternatively, we can write the quadratic as (x -10)(K x + L)=0.

Expanding:

K x² + (L -10 K)x -10 L=0.

Compare with A x² + Bx +C=0.

So,

K = A,

L -10 K = B,

-10 L = C.

From third equation: L= -C/10.

From second equation: L= B +10 K.

So, -C/10= B +10 K → Rearranged:

10 K + B + C/10=0.

But since K=A, 10 A + B + C/10=0.

Let me compute 10 A + B + C/10.

Compute each term:

10 A=10(1 + m²)=10 +10 m².

B= -20 m² -10 - (5√14 m)/28.

C/10= [100 m² + (50√14 m)/28 ] /10=10 m² + (5√14 m)/28.

So, 10 A + B + C/10= [10 +10 m²] + [ -20 m² -10 - (5√14 m)/28 ] + [10 m² + (5√14 m)/28 ].

Simplify term by term:

10 +10 m² -20 m² -10 - (5√14 m)/28 +10 m² + (5√14 m)/28.

Combine like terms:

10 -10=0.

10 m² -20 m² +10 m²=0.

-(5√14 m)/28 + (5√14 m)/28=0.

So, total is 0. So the condition holds. Thus, the quadratic factors as (x -10)(A x + L)=0, where L= -C/10.

Thus, the other root is x= -L/A.

Compute L= -C/10.

C=100 m² + (50√14 m)/28.

So, L= - [100 m² + (50√14 m)/28 ] /10= -10 m² - (5√14 m)/28.

Then, the other root x_P= -L/A= [10 m² + (5√14 m)/28 ] / (1 + m²).

Thus, x_P= [10 m² + (5√14 m)/28 ] / (1 + m²).

Compute this.

First, compute m= -12√14 /47.

So, m²= (144*14)/(47²)= 2016/2209.

Compute numerator:

10 m²=10*(2016/2209)=20160/2209.

(5√14 m)/28=5√14*(-12√14)/47 /28= [5*(-12)*14]/(47*28)= (-840)/(1296).

Wait, wait, let's compute step by step.

Wait, m= -12√14/47.

So, √14 * m= √14*(-12√14)/47= -12*14/47= -168/47.

So, (5√14 m)/28=5*(-168/47)/28= (-840)/ (47*28)= (-840)/1316= Simplify.

Divide numerator and denominator by 4: (-210)/329.

Wait, 840 ÷4=210, 28 ÷4=7. Wait, no: 28 is 28, 840/28=30. So, 5√14 m /28=5*(-12√14 *√14)/(47*28)=5*(-12*14)/(47*28)=5*(-168)/(1316)= (-840)/1316= simplify.

Divide numerator and denominator by 4: numerator= -210, denominator=329.

Wait, 1316 ÷4=329, yes.

So, (5√14 m)/28= -210/329.

So, numerator is 10 m² + (5√14 m)/28= 20160/2209 -210/329.

Convert to common denominator. Let me compute 2209 and 329.

Wait, 2209 is 47²=2209, and 329=7*47, because 7*47=329.

Yes, 7*47=329, and 47²=2209.

So, common denominator is 2209*7=15463.

Wait, but 329=7*47, 2209=47², so LCM is 7*47²=7*2209=15463.

So, 20160/2209=20160*7 /15463=141120/15463.

-210/329= -210*47 /15463= -9870/15463.

So, numerator=141120/15463 -9870/15463= (141120 -9870)/15463=131250/15463.

Denominator is 1 + m²=1 +2016/2209= (2209 +2016)/2209=4225/2209.

So, x_P= (131250/15463)/(4225/2209)= (131250/15463)*(2209/4225).

Simplify.

Note that 2209=47², 15463=47*7*47=7*47²=7*2209.

Wait, 47² is 2209. 15463=7*2209.

So, 15463=7*2209.

Similarly, 4225=65²= (5*13)^2.

So, let me compute numerator and denominator:

x_P= [131250/(7*2209)] * [2209/4225] =131250/(7*4225).

Simplify 131250 and 4225.

Divide numerator and denominator by 75:

4225 ÷75=56.333... Hmm, not integer. Maybe find GCD of 131250 and4225.

Compute GCD(131250,4225):

Divide 131250 by4225:

4225*31=130,975, which is less than 131250.

131250 -130975=275.

Now, GCD(4225,275).

4225 ÷275=15.36... 275*15=4125.

4225 -4125=100.

GCD(275,100)=25.

So, GCD is25.

So, 131250 ÷25=5250, 4225 ÷25=169.

So, x_P=5250/(7*169).

7*169=1183.

Wait, 169=13², 7*13²=1183.

So, x_P=5250/1183.

Simplify 5250 and 1183.

Check if they have any common factors.

1183 ÷7=169, which is 13². 5250 ÷7=750.

So, 5250=7*750, 1183=7*169.

So, x_P=7*750/(7*169)=750/169.

So, x_P=750/169.

Now, compute y_P= (-12√14/47)(x_P -10).

x_P -10=750/169 -10=750/169 -1690/169= (750 -1690)/169= (-940)/169.

So, y_P= (-12√14/47)*(-940)/169.

Compute this:

Multiply numerators: (-12√14)*(-940)=12*940√14=11280√14.

Denominator:47*169.

So, y_P=11280√14/(47*169).

Simplify:

11280 ÷47: 11280 ÷47=240, because 47*240=11280.

So, y_P=240√14 /169.

So, point P is at (750/169, 240√14/169).

Now, point A is at (10,0), which is (1690/169,0).

So, vector AP is from A(1690/169,0) to P(750/169,240√14/169).

Compute the distance AP.

Use distance formula:

AP= sqrt[(750/169 -1690/169)^2 + (240√14/169 -0)^2]

Simplify:

(750 -1690)/169= (-940)/169.

So, AP= sqrt[ (-940/169)^2 + (240√14/169)^2 ].

Factor out (1/169)^2:

AP= (1/169) sqrt[940² + (240√14)^2 ].

Compute inside sqrt:

940²= (900 +40)^2=900² +2*900*40 +40²=810000 +72000 +1600=883600.

(240√14)^2=240²*14=57600*14=806400.

So, total inside sqrt=883600 +806400=1,690,000.

sqrt(1,690,000)=1300.

So, AP=1300/169=1300 ÷13=100, 169 ÷13=13. So, 1300/169=100/13.

Wait, 13*13=169, 100/13 is about 7.69.

Wait, 1300/169 simplifies as 100/13 because 1300=100*13, 169=13².

So, 1300/169= (100*13)/13²=100/13.

So, AP=100/13.

So, m=100, n=13, which are coprime.

Thus, m +n=113.

To solve the problem, we start by noting that triangle \(ABC\) is inscribed in a circle \(\omega\). The tangents at \(B\) and \(C\) intersect at point \(D\), and line \(AD\) intersects \(\omega\) again at \(P\). We are given \(AB = 5\), \(BC = 9\), and \(AC = 10\), and we need to find \(AP\).

First, we calculate the circumradius \(R\) of triangle \(ABC\) using the formula \(R = \frac{abc}{4\Delta}\), where \(\Delta\) is the area of the triangle. Using Heron's formula, the semi-perimeter \(s\) is \(\frac{5 + 9 + 10}{2} = 12\), and the area \(\Delta = \sqrt{12 \times (12 - 5) \times (12 - 9) \times (12 - 10)} = 6\sqrt{14}\). Thus, \(R = \frac{5 \times 9 \times 10}{4 \times 6\sqrt{14}} = \frac{75\sqrt{14}}{56}\).

Next, we place the triangle in a coordinate system with \(C\) at the origin \((0,0)\), \(A\) at \((10,0)\), and \(B\) at \((\frac{39}{5}, \frac{6\sqrt{14}}{5})\). Using the circumradius and the coordinates, we determine the equation of the circumcircle \(\omega\).

The tangents at \(B\) and \(C\) intersect at point \(D\). By solving the equations of these tangents, we find \(D\) at \(\left(-\frac{15}{22}, \frac{30\sqrt{14}}{11}\right)\).

We then find the equation of line \(AD\) and determine its intersection with the circumcircle \(\omega\), yielding point \(P\). Using the distance formula, we calculate the length \(AP\), which simplifies to \(\frac{100}{13}\).

Thus, \(AP\) can be written as \(\frac{100}{13}\), and the sum of the numerator and denominator is \(100 + 13 = 113\).

\[
\boxed{113}
