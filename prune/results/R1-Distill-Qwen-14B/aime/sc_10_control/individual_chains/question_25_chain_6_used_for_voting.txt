Okay, so I've got this math problem about residents in Aimeville and what they own. Let me try to break this down. I remember something about sets and using the principle of inclusion-exclusion. Hmm, I think that's the right approach here.

So, the problem says there are 900 residents. Each resident owns a bag of candy hearts, which is a given. Then, they also own some combination of a diamond ring, set of golf clubs, and garden spade. The numbers given are: 195 own a diamond ring, 367 own golf clubs, 562 own a garden spade. 

Additionally, it's mentioned that each resident owns a bag of candy hearts. So, that's like a fourth item everyone has. Wait, but the problem is about finding how many own all four. Oh, but I think the way it's phrased is that each resident owns all four, but that can't be right because the numbers for the other items are less than 900. Wait no, the candy hearts are separate. Let me re-read that part.

"Each of the 900 residents owns a bag of candy hearts." So, candy hearts are universal—everybody has them. Then, the other three items (diamond ring, golf clubs, garden spade) are owned by some subset of the population. So, we're dealing with four sets: D (diamond), G (golf), S (spade), and C (candy hearts, which is the whole set because everyone has it). So, actually, the problem is to find the number of people who own all four, which is the intersection D ∩ G ∩ S ∩ C. Since C is everything, this is just D ∩ G ∩ S.

The problem gives me that 437 residents own exactly two of these things, and 234 own exactly three. Wait, but does that mean exactly two of the four items, including C? Or exactly two of the three non-C items?

Wait, hold on. Let me think. Since C is a given for everyone, so when they talk about owning exactly two things, does that include C or not? Hmm.

Wait, the problem says that each resident owns a bag of candy hearts. So, when it says "exactly two," it must mean exactly two of the other three items, because they all have C. So, they have C plus exactly two others. Similarly, owning exactly three would mean C plus two others, but wait, no—if all three other items, then that would be C plus all three, but the problem says 234 own exactly three. Hmm, now I'm confused.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me try to model this.

The four items are C (candy hearts—everybody has this), D (diamond), G (golf), S (spade). So, the problem is about the other three: D, G, S. Each resident owns C, but may or may not own D, G, S.

So, the total number of residents is 900. The counts are:

- D: 195
- G: 367
- S: 562

Each resident has C, so we can think of the problem as: find the intersection of D, G, S, which is the number of people who have all three, because C is universal. So, the number we’re looking for is |D ∩ G ∩ S|.

We also know that 437 residents own exactly two of these things (excluding C). Wait, no. Wait, if someone owns exactly two, does that count C as one? Hmm, probably not. Because if they have C and two others, that would be three things. But the wording says "exactly two of these things." Wait, but the sentence says: "437 residents who own exactly two of these things." The "these things" might refer to all four, which includes C. But since everyone owns C, owning exactly two would have to include C. So, that would mean each of these 437 residents owns C and exactly one other item.

Wait, that's another possibility. Because if someone owns exactly two of all four, since they have C, they must have C and one more. So, the 437 own exactly two, meaning they have C plus one other. Similarly, the 234 who own exactly three would have C plus two others. Hmm, that might make sense.

Let me try to write this down.

Let’s denote:

- Exactly two: these are the people who have C and exactly one more item. So, for each pair, the count is the number who have C plus that pair. So, the total exactly two would be the sum of the people who have C and D only, C and G only, C and S only.

Similarly, exactly three would be the people who have C plus two of the other three. So, they have C, D, G; C, D, S; or C, G, S.

But the problem says 437 own exactly two of these things, and 234 own exactly three of these things. So, 'these things' refer to all four, including C. So, someone owning exactly two would have two of the four, which, since they have C, that means one of D, G, S.

Wait, but if that's the case, then the 437 are people who have exactly two of the four, meaning they have C plus one more. Because if they had two from D, G, S, that would be C plus two, which would make it exactly three, not two.

Wait, this is getting confusing. Maybe I should model this using the inclusion-exclusion principle.

Total number of residents is 900. Each has C. So, the problem is about the other three items: D, G, S. So, the total number is the sum over all subsets. Wait, maybe I should think of it as the union of D, G, S. But since C is universal, the counts for D, G, S are subsets of the 900.

Let me think in terms of the principle of inclusion-exclusion for three sets.

The formula is:

|D ∪ G ∪ S| = |D| + |G| + |S| - |D ∩ G| - |D ∩ S| - |G ∩ S| + |D ∩ G ∩ S|

But here, we don't know |D ∪ G ∪ S|. However, since everyone has C, but not necessarily the others. Wait, but D, G, S are just some subsets. So, the maximum possible is 900, but maybe not everyone has at least one of D, G, S. Wait, but the problem doesn't specify that. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps we can model the counts of people in different categories based on how many of D, G, S they own.

Each resident can have:

- Only C: 0 of D, G, S.

- Exactly one: C and one of D, G, S.

- Exactly two: C and two of D, G, S.

- Exactly three: C and all three of D, G, S.

So, the total number of residents is the sum of all these categories.

Let me denote:

- a = number with only C: 0 other items.

- b = number with C and exactly one other item.

- c = number with C and exactly two others.

- d = number with C and all three others.

So, a + b + c + d = 900.

We know that c = 437 (exactly two of the things, which would be C and two others), and d = 234 (exactly three of the things, which would be C and the other three).

Wait, but no, the problem says 437 own exactly two of these things. Hmm, wait, if they own exactly two of all four things, which includes C, that would mean they have C plus one other. So, in that case, c is 437.

Similarly, the 234 own exactly three of the four, which would mean they have C plus two others. So, that would be the number of people in exactly two of D, G, S, but wait, no—wait, if someone has exactly three of the four, that would be C plus two others, so that's the number of people in exactly two of D, G, S.

Wait, I'm getting confused again. Let me think carefully.

If someone owns exactly two of the four things, including C, then that means they have C and exactly one other item. So, the number of such people is the sum of those who have C and D only, C and G only, and C and S only. So, that's 437.

Similarly, if someone owns exactly three of the four things, that would mean they have C and exactly two of the other three. So, those are the people who have C plus two of D, G, S. So, that's 234.

So, let's denote:

- a: only C.

- bd: C and D only.

- bg: C and G only.

- bs: C and S only.

- dc: C, D, and G only.

- ds: C, D, and S only.

- gs: C, G, and S only.

- dgs: C, D, G, and S (all four).

So, the 437 owning exactly two would be bd + bg + bs = 437.

The 234 owning exactly three would be dc + ds + gs = 234.

And the number we're looking for is dgs, which is the number owning all four.

Now, let's express the total number of people who own D, G, S in terms of these variables.

The total number owning D is the sum of bd + dc + ds + dgs.

Similarly, for G: bg + dc + gs + dgs.

For S: bs + ds + gs + dgs.

Given that:

|D| = 195 = bd + dc + ds + dgs.

|G| = 367 = bg + dc + gs + dgs.

|S| = 562 = bs + ds + gs + dgs.

We also have:

bd + bg + bs = 437.

dc + ds + gs = 234.

And we need to find dgs.

Additionally, the total number of people is:

a + (bd + bg + bs) + (dc + ds + gs) + dgs = a + 437 + 234 + dgs = 900.

So, a = 900 - 437 - 234 - dgs = 900 - 671 - dgs = 229 - dgs.

Now, let's think about the inclusion-exclusion formula for D, G, S.

|D ∪ G ∪ S| = |D| + |G| + |S| - |D ∩ G| - |D ∩ S| - |G ∩ S| + |D ∩ G ∩ S|.

But |D ∪ G ∪ S| would be the number of people who own at least one of D, G, S. But since everyone owns C, this is the same as the number of people who own at least one of D, G, S. Alternatively, the number is equal to (total residents) minus the number of people who own only C.

So, |D ∪ G ∪ S| = 900 - a = 900 - (229 - dgs) = 900 - 229 + dgs = 671 + dgs.

Now, let's compute |D ∩ G|, |D ∩ S|, |G ∩ S|.

Wait, |D ∩ G| is the number of people who own both D and G. This includes those who own only D and G (i.e., C, D, G), those who own D, G, and S, and those who own all four. Wait no, actually, |D ∩ G| includes all people who own both D and G, regardless of other ownership. So, |D ∩ G| = dc + dgs.

Similarly, |D ∩ S| = ds + dgs.

And |G ∩ S| = gs + dgs.

But wait, from our earlier variables:

dc is the number of people with C, D, G only.

ds is the number with C, D, S only.

gs is the number with C, G, S only.

dgs is the number with all four.

So, |D ∩ G| is the number of people with D and G, which includes dc (C, D, G) and dgs (all four). So, |D ∩ G| = dc + dgs.

Similarly, |D ∩ S| = ds + dgs.

And |G ∩ S| = gs + dgs.

So, let me write down the inclusion-exclusion formula:

|D ∪ G ∪ S| = |D| + |G| + |S| - (|D ∩ G| + |D ∩ S| + |G ∩ S|) + |D ∩ G ∩ S|.

We have |D| = 195, |G|=367, |S|=562.

So,

|D ∪ G ∪ S| = 195 + 367 + 562 - ( (dc + dgs) + (ds + dgs) + (gs + dgs) ) + dgs.

Simplify:

Sum D, G, S: 195 + 367 = 562; 562 + 562 = 1124? Wait, 195 + 367 is 562? Let me compute:

195 + 367 = 562? 195 + 300 is 495, plus 67 is 562. Yes.

So, 195 + 367 + 562 = 1124.

Then, subtract (dc + dgs + ds + dgs + gs + dgs):

That's (dc + ds + gs) + 3*dgs.

We know dc + ds + gs = 234.

So, we subtract (234 + 3dgs).

Then, add back |D ∩ G ∩ S|, which is dgs.

So, putting it together:

|D ∪ G ∪ S| = 1124 - (234 + 3dgs) + dgs = 1124 -234 -2dgs = 890 - 2dgs.

But earlier, we found |D ∪ G ∪ S| = 671 + dgs.

So, set them equal:

890 - 2dgs = 671 + dgs.

Solving:

890 - 671 = 3dgs.

219 = 3dgs → dgs = 73.

So, the number of residents who own all four is 73.

To solve the problem, we use the principle of inclusion-exclusion and analyze the ownership of the items among the 900 residents.

1. **Define Variables:**
   - Let \( a \) be the number of residents who own only candy hearts (C).
   - Let \( b \) be the number of residents who own C and exactly one other item.
   - Let \( c = 437 \) be the number of residents who own C and exactly two other items.
   - Let \( d = 234 \) be the number of residents who own C and exactly three other items.
   - Let \( x \) be the number of residents who own all four items (C, D, G, S).

2. **Total Residents:**
   \[
   a + b + c + d + x = 900
   \]
   Substituting \( c = 437 \) and \( d = 234 \):
   \[
   a + b + 437 + 234 + x = 900 \implies a + b + x = 229
   \]

3. **Ownership Counts:**
   - For D: \( b_D + x = 195 \)
   - For G: \( b_G + x = 367 \)
   - For S: \( b_S + x = 562 \)
   where \( b_D, b_G, b_S \) are the counts of residents owning C and exactly two items (from the 437).

4. **Sum of Ownership Counts:**
   \[
   (b_D + b_G + b_S) + 3x = 195 + 367 + 562 = 1124
   \]
   Since \( b_D + b_G + b_S = 437 \):
   \[
   437 + 3x = 1124 \implies 3x = 687 \implies x = 229
   \]

However, this result is inconsistent with the previous equation \( a + b + x = 229 \). Re-evaluating using the inclusion-exclusion principle yields:

5. **Inclusion-Exclusion Principle:**
   \[
   |D \cup G \cup S| = 195 + 367 + 562 - (|D \cap G| + |D \cap S| + |G \cap S|) + |D \cap G \cap S|
   \]
   Simplifying:
   \[
   |D \cup G \cup S| = 1124 - (234 + 3x) + x = 890 - 2x
   \]
   Since \( |D \cup G \cup S| = 900 - a \) and \( a = 229 - x \):
   \[
   890 - 2x = 671 + x \implies 3x = 219 \implies x = 73
   \]

Thus, the number of residents who own all four items is:

\boxed{73}
