Okay, so I've got this geometry problem here, and I need to find the length of AP in triangle ABC. Let me try to unpack the problem step by step.

First, the triangle ABC is inscribed in a circle ω. That means ω is the circumcircle of triangle ABC. The problem gives me the lengths of the sides: AB is 5 units, BC is 9 units, and AC is 10 units. So, sides are 5, 9, 10. Hmm, okay, that might be useful later on. Maybe I can find some angles or other properties from that.

Next, it says that the tangents to ω at points B and C intersect at point D. So, point D is the intersection of the two tangents from B and C. I remember that the point where two tangents meet is called the ex-pole or something like that. But more importantly, I recall that the tangent from a point to a circle is perpendicular to the radius at the point of contact. So, the tangent at B is perpendicular to OB, where O is the center of ω, and similarly for the tangent at C.

Then, the line AD intersects ω again at point P. So, starting from A, drawing a line to D, which is outside the circle, and this line intersects the circle again at P. My goal is to find the length AP, expressed as a reduced fraction m/n, and then find m + n.

Alright, so I need to find AP. Let me think about the possible approaches. Since we're dealing with a circle, tangents, and intersections, maybe power of a point would come into play here. Power of a point D with respect to ω is probably a key concept here.

Power of a point D: the power of D with respect to ω is equal to DB² = DC², since D lies on both tangents. So, DB = DC because both are tangents from D to ω.

Wait, no, actually, power of a point D is equal to DB² and also DC², so indeed, DB = DC. So, D lies on the perpendicular bisector of BC. Hmm, might that help me later?

Alternatively, maybe I can use harmonic division or projective geometry concepts. Or perhaps use inversion, but that might be overcomplicating.

Alternatively, maybe Menelaus' theorem or Ceva's theorem could help here. Or perhaps using similar triangles.

Wait, let's think about power of a point. Since D is outside the circle, and AD intersects the circle at A and P, the power of D with respect to ω is equal to DB² = DC² = DA * DP. So, that gives an equation: DB² = DA * DP.

If I can find DA, then I can find DP, because I know DB. Alternatively, if I can express DP in terms of AP, since DP = AP + something? Wait, no, because P is between A and D? Or is D outside?

Wait, in the Asymptote code, they draw A connected to D and then intersect the circle again at P. So, the line AD goes from A, passes through P, then goes to D. So, the order is A, then P, then D. So, AP is from A to P, and PD is from P to D. So, the entire length AD = AP + PD.

So, from the power of point D: DB² = DA * DP.

So, DB² = (AP + PD) * PD.

Wait, no, DA is the entire length from D to A, and DP is from D to P. Wait, no, DA is from D to A, which is a straight line, and P is between A and D. So, DP = DA - AP. Wait, no, if you have points A and D, with P lying on AD, then DA is from D to A, and if P is between A and D, then DP is the same as DA - AP? Wait, I think I'm getting confused.

Wait, let me define it properly. Let me denote the length from A to P as x, which is AP. Then, the length from P to D is PD. So, the entire length DA is AP + PD, which is x + PD. But according to the power of a point, DB² = DA * DP. Wait, no: wait, power of point D with respect to ω is DB² = DP * DA. Because DA is the secant line, and DP is the external segment. Wait, actually, the formula is: if a line from D intersects the circle at two points, say X and Y, with X closer to D, then the power is DX * DY.

In this case, DA is the secant line, starting at D, passing through P (closer to D), then through A. So, the power of point D is DP * DA. Wait, no, no: the points are D---P---A, so DP is the distance from D to P, and DA is from D to A. So, the power of D is DP * DA. Wait, no, that can't be, because DA is longer than DP. Wait, perhaps I should think of it as the product of the entire secant segment and its external part.

Wait, another way: if you have a point D outside the circle, and a secant from D passing through the circle at P and A, then the power of D is equal to DP * DA. Wait, no, actually, the power is equal to DP * DA' where DA' is the entire length from D through the circle. Wait, no, more accurately, the power is equal to DP * DQ, where DP is the distance from D to the first intersection point (P), and DQ is the distance from D to the second intersection point (A). So, it's DP * DA. But wait, in this case, A is on the circle, so DA is the length from D to A, which is the same as the length from D to the second intersection point. So, the power of D is DP * DA.

But also, the power of D is equal to DB², since DB is the tangent from D to ω. So, we have:

DB² = DP * DA.

Let me write that equation down:

DB² = DP * DA.

But DA is the distance from D to A, which is equal to DP + PA. Wait, no: If the points are arranged as D---P---A, then DA = DP + PA. So, DA is longer than DP. So, substituting DA = DP + PA, we have:

DB² = DP * (DP + PA).

Hmm, but I don't know DP or DA yet. Maybe I can find DA in terms of other variables.

Alternatively, perhaps I can express DA in terms of the sides of the triangle. Let me consider triangle ABC with sides AB=5, BC=9, AC=10. Maybe I can find some angles or use the Law of Cosines to find some angles, which might help.

First, let me compute the semi-perimeter of triangle ABC to find its area. The semi-perimeter s = (5 + 9 + 10)/2 = (24)/2 = 12.

Then, using Heron's formula, the area K is sqrt[s(s - AB)(s - BC)(s - AC)] = sqrt[12*(12-5)*(12-9)*(12-10)] = sqrt[12*7*3*2] = sqrt[504] = sqrt[16*31.5] =  Hmm, wait, 504 factors: 504 = 16 * 31.5? Wait, no, 504 = 16 * 31.5 isn't an integer. Wait, let me factor 504.

504 divided by 2 is 252, divided by 2 is 126, divided by 2 is 63, which is 7*9. So, 504 = 2^3 * 3^2 * 7. So, sqrt(504) = 2^(1.5) * 3 * sqrt(7) = 2*sqrt(2)*3*sqrt(7) = 6*sqrt(14). So, area K is 6*sqrt(14).

So, area K = 6√14.

Alternatively, maybe I can use the Law of Cosines to find angles. Let me try that.

In triangle ABC, sides:

AB = c = 5

BC = a = 9

AC = b = 10

Wait, standard notation is usually opposite angles. So, a is BC, opposite angle A; b is AC, opposite angle B; c is AB, opposite angle C. Wait, maybe I should double-check.

Wait, standard notation is: side a is opposite angle A, side b opposite angle B, side c opposite angle C. So, in triangle ABC, side BC is opposite angle A, so a = BC =9; side AC is opposite angle B, so b = AC=10; and side AB is opposite angle C, so c=AB=5.

So, angles: angle A is opposite side a=9, angle B opposite side b=10, angle C opposite side c=5.

So, using the Law of Cosines, maybe I can find angle A.

Law of Cosines: cos A = (b² + c² - a²)/(2bc)

Plugging in the values:

cos A = (10² + 5² - 9²)/(2*10*5) = (100 + 25 - 81)/(100) = (44)/100 = 0.44.

So, cos A = 0.44, so angle A is arccos(0.44). Hmm, I can compute its sine as well for area purposes.

sin A = sqrt(1 - cos² A) = sqrt(1 - 0.44²) = sqrt(1 - 0.1936) = sqrt(0.8064) ≈ 0.898, but maybe exact value is better.

Wait, 0.8064 is 8064/10000, which can be reduced. Let me compute 8064/10000.

Divide numerator and denominator by 16: 8064/16 = 504; 10000/16=625. So, 504/625. So, sin A = sqrt(504/625) = sqrt(504)/25. Wait, but sqrt(504) is sqrt(16*31.5) which is 4*sqrt(31.5), but 31.5 is 63/2, so sqrt(63/2) = (3*sqrt(14))/sqrt(2) = (3*sqrt(28))/2. Hmm, getting messy. Maybe I should leave it as sqrt(504)/25 for now.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to compute the circumradius R of triangle ABC, since the circle ω is the circumcircle. The formula for the circumradius R is (a*b*c)/(4*K), where a, b, c are the sides and K is the area.

So, R = (9 * 10 * 5)/(4 * 6√14) = (450)/(24√14) = (75)/(4√14) = (75√14)/(4*14) = (75√14)/56.

Simplify that: 75 and 56 have a common factor? 75 is 15*5, 56 is 8*7, so no common factors. So, R = (75√14)/56.

Hmm, okay, so the radius of the circumcircle is known. But how does that help me?

Alternatively, perhaps I can find the coordinates of the points. Let me consider placing triangle ABC in a coordinate system to make it easier. Let me place point C at the origin (0,0), point B somewhere on the x-axis, and point A somewhere in the plane. Wait, but perhaps a better coordinate system.

Alternatively, place point C at (0,0), point B at (9,0), since BC=9, but wait, AC is 10 and AB is 5, so that might complicate things. Alternatively, set C at (0,0), and point A at (10,0), since AC=10. Then point B would be somewhere in the plane such that AB=5 and BC=9. Let me try to compute the coordinates.

So, let me set C at (0,0), A at (10,0). Then, point B is at (x,y) such that the distance from B to C is 9, and the distance from B to A is 5.

So, distance from B to C: sqrt(x² + y²) =9 → x² + y²=81.

Distance from B to A: sqrt( (x -10)^2 + y^2 )=5 → (x -10)^2 + y²=25.

Subtracting the first equation from the second:

(x -10)^2 + y² - (x² + y²) =25 -81 → x² -20x +100 + y² -x² - y² = -56 → -20x +100 = -56 → -20x = -156 → x=156/20=39/5=7.8.

So, x=7.8, which is 39/5. Then, from x² + y²=81, we can find y.

x=39/5, so x²= (39/5)²=1521/25.

So, y²=81 -1521/25 = (2025 -1521)/25 = 504/25 → y= sqrt(504)/5 = (sqrt(504))/5 = (sqrt(16*31.5))/5 = (4*sqrt(31.5))/5. But 31.5 is 63/2, so sqrt(63/2) = (3*sqrt(14))/sqrt(2) = (3*sqrt(28))/2. Hmm, perhaps better to just leave it as sqrt(504)/5 for now.

So, point B is at (39/5, sqrt(504)/5). So, coordinates are:

A: (10,0)

B: (39/5, sqrt(504)/5)

C: (0,0)

Okay, now, need to find point D, which is the intersection of the tangents at B and C.

The tangent at C is easy since C is at (0,0). The tangent at C: since the circle passes through C, the tangent at C is perpendicular to the radius OC, where O is the circumcenter.

Wait, but maybe it's easier to find the equations of the tangents at B and C.

Alternatively, perhaps I can find the equation of the tangent at B. Since point B is on the circle, the tangent at B can be found using the derivative or using the fact that it's perpendicular to the radius OB.

But first, I need to find the circumcenter O of triangle ABC, because the radius is from O to B and O to C.

Given that, let me compute the circumcenter O.

The circumcenter is the intersection of the perpendicular bisectors of the sides.

Given that, let's find the perpendicular bisector of AB and AC or something like that.

Wait, but given the coordinates, maybe I can compute O.

Points A: (10,0), B: (39/5, sqrt(504)/5), C: (0,0).

Let me find the perpendicular bisector of AB and AC.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to use the formula for circumradius and coordinates.

Alternatively, the circumcenter can be found by solving the perpendicular bisector equations.

Let me compute the midpoint of AB and the midpoint of AC, then find the equations of the perpendicular bisectors.

Midpoint of AB:

A is (10,0), B is (39/5, sqrt(504)/5).

Midpoint M1: x = (10 + 39/5)/2 = (50/5 +39/5)/2 = (89/5)/2=89/10=8.9

y = (0 + sqrt(504)/5)/2 = sqrt(504)/10.

So, M1=(89/10, sqrt(504)/10).

The slope of AB is (sqrt(504)/5 - 0)/(39/5 -10) = (sqrt(504)/5)/(39/5 -50/5) = (sqrt(504)/5)/(-11/5) = -sqrt(504)/11.

So, the slope of AB is -sqrt(504)/11. Therefore, the perpendicular bisector of AB has slope reciprocal and opposite sign: 11/sqrt(504).

So, the equation of the perpendicular bisector of AB is:

(y - sqrt(504)/10) = (11/sqrt(504))(x - 89/10)

Similarly, let's find the perpendicular bisector of AC.

Midpoint of AC:

A is (10,0), C is (0,0). Midpoint M2 is (5,0).

The slope of AC is (0 -0)/(0 -10) = 0, so it's a horizontal line. Therefore, the perpendicular bisector is vertical, with undefined slope. So, the perpendicular bisector is the line x=5.

So, now, the circumcenter O is the intersection of the two perpendicular bisectors: the perpendicular bisector of AB and the perpendicular bisector of AC (x=5).

So, plug x=5 into the equation of the perpendicular bisector of AB:

(y - sqrt(504)/10) = (11/sqrt(504))(5 - 89/10)

Compute 5 - 89/10: 5 is 50/10, so 50/10 -89/10= -39/10.

So,

y - sqrt(504)/10 = (11/sqrt(504))*(-39/10)

So,

y = sqrt(504)/10 + (11 * (-39))/(sqrt(504)*10)

Simplify:

y = [sqrt(504) - (429)/sqrt(504)] /10

Combine terms:

Multiply numerator and denominator by sqrt(504):

y = [504 - 429]/(10 * sqrt(504)) = (75)/(10 * sqrt(504)) = 15/(2 * sqrt(504))

Simplify sqrt(504): 504 = 16*31.5, which is 16*63/2=504, so sqrt(504)=sqrt(16*31.5)=4*sqrt(31.5). But 31.5 is 63/2, so sqrt(63/2)= (3*sqrt(14))/sqrt(2)= (3*sqrt(28))/2. Hmm, maybe another approach.

Alternatively, sqrt(504)=sqrt(16*31.5)=4*sqrt(31.5)=4*sqrt(63/2)=4*(3*sqrt(14)/sqrt(2))= (12 sqrt(14))/sqrt(2)= 12 sqrt(7). Wait, no: sqrt(63/2)=sqrt(63)/sqrt(2)= (3*sqrt(7))/sqrt(2). So, sqrt(504)=4*(3*sqrt(7)/sqrt(2))= (12 sqrt(7))/sqrt(2)= 12*sqrt(14)/2=6*sqrt(14).

Ah, yes! Because sqrt(63/2)= sqrt(9*7/2)=3*sqrt(7/2). So, 4*sqrt(63/2)=4*3*sqrt(7/2)=12*sqrt(7/2). But sqrt(7/2)=sqrt(14)/2. So, 12*sqrt(14)/2=6*sqrt(14).

So, sqrt(504)=6*sqrt(14). Therefore, y=15/(2*6*sqrt(14))=15/(12 sqrt(14))=5/(4 sqrt(14)).

Rationalizing the denominator:

y=5/(4 sqrt(14)) * (sqrt(14)/sqrt(14))=5 sqrt(14)/(4*14)=5 sqrt(14)/56.

So, y=5 sqrt(14)/56.

Therefore, the circumcenter O is at (5,5 sqrt(14)/56).

Wait, that seems a bit small for the y-coordinate. Let me double-check my calculations.

Wait, in the step where I compute y:

y = [sqrt(504) - (429)/sqrt(504)] /10

Which is [sqrt(504) - 429/sqrt(504)] /10.

Let me compute sqrt(504)=6 sqrt(14), as before.

So, sqrt(504)=6 sqrt(14), and 429/sqrt(504)=429/(6 sqrt(14))= (143)/(2 sqrt(14)).

So,

y= [6 sqrt(14) - 143/(2 sqrt(14)) ] /10.

To combine these terms, let's write them with a common denominator:

= [ (6 sqrt(14) * 2 sqrt(14)) - 143 ] / (2 sqrt(14)) /10

Wait, no, another approach: Let me rationalize each term.

First term: 6 sqrt(14) is fine.

Second term: 143/(2 sqrt(14))= (143 sqrt(14))/(2*14)= (143 sqrt(14))/28.

So, the numerator becomes:

6 sqrt(14) - (143 sqrt(14))/28 = (6*28 sqrt(14) -143 sqrt(14))/28 = (168 sqrt(14)-143 sqrt(14))/28 = (25 sqrt(14))/28.

So, y= (25 sqrt(14)/28)/10=25 sqrt(14)/(280)=5 sqrt(14)/56.

Yes, that's correct. So, y=5 sqrt(14)/56.

Thus, the circumradius center O is at (5,5 sqrt(14)/56).

Now, with O known, let me find the equations of the tangents at B and C.

First, the tangent at C is easy since C is at (0,0). The tangent at C is perpendicular to OC.

The slope of OC is (5 sqrt(14)/56 -0)/(5 -0)= (5 sqrt(14)/56)/5 = sqrt(14)/56.

So, the slope of OC is sqrt(14)/56. Therefore, the slope of the tangent at C is the negative reciprocal, which is -56/sqrt(14).

Simplify: -56/sqrt(14)= -56 sqrt(14)/14= -4 sqrt(14).

So, the tangent at C has slope -4 sqrt(14).

Therefore, the equation of the tangent at C is y = -4 sqrt(14) x + 0, since it passes through (0,0).

Similarly, find the tangent at B. The tangent at B is perpendicular to the radius OB.

Coordinates of B: (39/5, sqrt(504)/5)= (7.8, sqrt(504)/5). From earlier, sqrt(504)=6 sqrt(14), so sqrt(504)/5=6 sqrt(14)/5.

So, point B is (39/5,6 sqrt(14)/5).

Coordinates of O: (5,5 sqrt(14)/56).

So, the slope of OB is [6 sqrt(14)/5 -5 sqrt(14)/56 ] / [39/5 -5].

Compute numerator:

6 sqrt(14)/5 -5 sqrt(14)/56 = sqrt(14)*(6/5 -5/56)= sqrt(14)*( (6*56 -5*5)/ (5*56) )= sqrt(14)*( (336 -25)/280 )= sqrt(14)*(311/280).

Denominator:

39/5 -5 = 39/5 -25/5=14/5.

So, slope of OB is [sqrt(14)*(311/280)] / (14/5)= [sqrt(14)*(311/280)] * (5/14)= sqrt(14)*(311*5)/(280*14)= sqrt(14)*(1555)/(3920).

Simplify 1555 and 3920: Let's see if they have common factors.

1555 divided by 5 is 311. 3920 divided by 5 is 784. 311 is a prime number (I think so). So, 1555=5*311, 3920=5*784. So, the slope becomes sqrt(14)*(5*311)/(5*784)= sqrt(14)*(311/784).

So, the slope of OB is (311 sqrt(14))/784.

Therefore, the slope of the tangent at B is the negative reciprocal: -784/(311 sqrt(14)).

Rationalizing the denominator:

-784/(311 sqrt(14))= -784 sqrt(14)/(311 *14)= -56 sqrt(14)/311.

So, the slope of the tangent at B is -56 sqrt(14)/311.

Now, equation of tangent at B: passes through B (39/5,6 sqrt(14)/5), with slope -56 sqrt(14)/311.

So, equation: y -6 sqrt(14)/5 = (-56 sqrt(14)/311)(x -39/5).

Similarly, the tangent at C has equation y= -4 sqrt(14) x.

Now, to find point D, the intersection of these two tangents.

So, solve the system:

y = -4 sqrt(14) x

and

y -6 sqrt(14)/5 = (-56 sqrt(14)/311)(x -39/5).

Substitute y from the first equation into the second:

-4 sqrt(14) x -6 sqrt(14)/5 = (-56 sqrt(14)/311)(x -39/5)

Let's factor out sqrt(14):

sqrt(14)[ -4x -6/5 ] = sqrt(14)[ (-56/311)(x -39/5) ]

Divide both sides by sqrt(14):

-4x -6/5 = (-56/311)(x -39/5)

Multiply both sides by 311 to eliminate denominators:

-4x *311 - (6/5)*311 = -56(x -39/5)

Compute each term:

-4*311 x = -1244 x

-6/5 *311= - (6*311)/5= -1866/5

-56(x -39/5)= -56x + (56*39)/5= -56x + 2184/5

So, the equation becomes:

-1244x -1866/5 = -56x +2184/5

Bring all terms to left side:

-1244x +56x -1866/5 -2184/5 =0

Compute:

-1188x - (1866 +2184)/5=0

Compute 1866 +2184: 1866+2000=3866, 3866+184=4050. So,

-1188x -4050/5=0 → -1188x -810=0 → -1188x=810 → x= -810/1188.

Simplify: divide numerator and denominator by 9:

-810/1188 = -90/132 = -15/22.

So, x= -15/22.

Then, from y= -4 sqrt(14) x,

y= -4 sqrt(14)*(-15/22)= (60 sqrt(14))/22= (30 sqrt(14))/11.

So, point D is at (-15/22, 30 sqrt(14)/11).

Okay, so now I have point D at (-15/22, 30 sqrt(14)/11).

Now, need to find the equation of line AD, which connects point A (10,0) and D (-15/22,30 sqrt(14)/11).

Compute the slope of AD:

m = [30 sqrt(14)/11 -0]/[ (-15/22 -10) ] = [30 sqrt(14)/11 ] / [ (-15/22 -220/22) ] = [30 sqrt(14)/11 ] / [ (-235/22) ].

Simplify:

= [30 sqrt(14)/11 ] * [ -22/235 ] = [30 sqrt(14)*(-22) ] / [11*235 ].

Simplify numerator and denominator:

30 and 235: 30=5*6, 235=5*47, so 30/235=6/47.

22 and 11: 22=2*11, so 22/11=2.

So,

= [ (-60 sqrt(14)) ] / [47 ].

Wait, wait, let me recompute:

Numerator: 30 * (-22) = -660

Denominator:11 *235=2585.

Simplify -660/2585: divide numerator and denominator by 5: -132/517. Wait, 132 and 517: 132=4*33=4*3*11; 517 divided by 11 is 47, because 11*47=517. So, 132=11*12, 517=11*47. So, divide numerator and denominator by 11: -12/47.

So, the slope m is (-12 sqrt(14))/47.

Wait, no: wait, m= [30 sqrt(14)/11 ] * [ -22/235 ] = [30*(-22) sqrt(14)]/(11*235).

Let me compute numerator: 30*(-22)= -660.

Denominator:11*235=2585.

So, m= (-660 sqrt(14))/2585.

Simplify:

Divide numerator and denominator by 5: numerator becomes -132 sqrt(14), denominator becomes 517.

132 and 517: 132=11*12, 517=11*47. So, divide numerator and denominator by 11: numerator becomes -12 sqrt(14), denominator becomes 47.

So, slope m= (-12 sqrt(14))/47.

So, the equation of line AD is:

y -0 = m(x -10)

So,

y= [ (-12 sqrt(14))/47 ] (x -10 )

Now, find point P where this line intersects the circumcircle again.

The circumcircle has center O at (5,5 sqrt(14)/56) and radius R=75 sqrt(14)/56, as computed earlier.

Equation of the circle ω: (x -5)^2 + (y -5 sqrt(14)/56)^2 = (75 sqrt(14)/56)^2.

So, to find the intersection points of line AD with circle ω, substitute y from the line equation into the circle equation.

So, substitute y= [ (-12 sqrt(14))/47 ](x -10 ) into the circle equation.

This might get messy, but let me proceed step by step.

Let me denote m= -12 sqrt(14)/47 for simplicity.

So, y= m(x -10).

Substitute into circle equation:

(x -5)^2 + (m(x -10) -5 sqrt(14)/56 )^2 = (75 sqrt(14)/56)^2.

Expand this:

(x -5)^2 + [ m(x -10) -5 sqrt(14)/56 ]^2 - (75 sqrt(14)/56)^2 =0.

This will give a quadratic equation in x, which should have two solutions: one at point A (x=10, y=0), and the other at point P.

But since we already know that point A is on both the line and the circle, it's one solution, and P is the other.

So, solving this quadratic will give us the x-coordinate of P, and then we can find y.

Alternatively, knowing that AD intersects the circle at A and P, we can parametrize the line AD and find the point P.

But perhaps a better approach is to parametrize the line AD and find the parameter where it intersects the circle again.

Parametrize AD: starting at A (10,0), moving towards D (-15/22,30 sqrt(14)/11).

Let me write parametric equations:

x =10 + t*( (-15/22) -10 )=10 + t*( (-15/22 -220/22) )=10 + t*( -235/22 )

y=0 + t*(30 sqrt(14)/11 -0 )= t*(30 sqrt(14)/11 )

So, x=10 - (235/22) t

y= (30 sqrt(14)/11 ) t

Now, plug these into the circle equation:

(x -5)^2 + (y -5 sqrt(14)/56)^2 = (75 sqrt(14)/56)^2.

Compute x-5: (10 -5) - (235/22) t =5 - (235 t)/22.

y -5 sqrt(14)/56 = (30 sqrt(14)/11 ) t -5 sqrt(14)/56.

So, substituting:

[5 - (235 t)/22]^2 + [ (30 sqrt(14)/11 t -5 sqrt(14)/56 ) ]^2 = (75 sqrt(14)/56)^2.

Let me compute each term.

First term: [5 - (235 t)/22]^2 =25 - 2*5*(235 t)/22 + (235 t/22)^2=25 - (2350 t)/22 + (235² t²)/(22²).

Second term: [30 sqrt(14)/11 t -5 sqrt(14)/56]^2.

Factor sqrt(14):

sqrt(14)[30/11 t -5/56]^2.

So, [sqrt(14)(30/11 t -5/56)]^2=14*(30/11 t -5/56)^2.

So, expanding (30/11 t -5/56)^2:

= (30/11 t)^2 - 2*(30/11 t)*(5/56) + (5/56)^2

= (900/121) t² - (300/616) t +25/3136.

Simplify coefficients:

300/616 = 75/154.

So, second term becomes:

14*(900/121 t² -75/154 t +25/3136 )=14*(900/121) t² -14*(75/154) t +14*(25/3136).

Compute each:

14*(900/121)= 12600/121.

14*(75/154)= (14*75)/154= (1050)/154= 525/77.

14*(25/3136)=350/3136=25/224.

So, second term expansion: 12600/121 t² -525/77 t +25/224.

Now, the circle equation becomes:

First term + second term = (75 sqrt(14)/56)^2.

Compute RHS: (75 sqrt(14)/56)^2=75² *14 /56²= 5625*14/(3136)=78750/3136.

So, left side:

[25 - (2350 t)/22 + (235² t²)/(22²)] + [12600/121 t² -525/77 t +25/224] =78750/3136.

Combine like terms:

Constant terms:25 +25/224= (25*224 +25)/224= (5600 +25)/224=5625/224.

Linear terms: [ -2350/22 -525/77 ] t.

Quadratic terms: [ (235²)/(22²) +12600/121 ] t².

Let me compute each part step by step.

First, constants: 5625/224.

Linear terms:

-2350/22 -525/77.

Find common denominator:22 and77. LCM of 22 and77: 22=2*11, 77=7*11. So, LCM=2*7*11=154.

Convert each fraction:

-2350/22 = (-2350 *7)/154= -16450/154.

-525/77= (-525 *2)/154= -1050/154.

So, total linear term: (-16450 -1050)/154= -17500/154= -8750/77= -1250/11.

Wait, 17500 divided by 14 is 1250, and 154 divided by14 is 11. So, yes, -17500/154= -1250/11.

So, linear term is (-1250/11) t.

Quadratic terms:

(235²)/(22²) +12600/121.

Compute 235²:235*235=55225.

22²=484, so 55225/484.

12600/121 is as is.

So, sum is (55225/484) + (12600/121)=55225/484 + (12600*4)/484=55225/484 +50400/484=105625/484.

So, quadratic term is (105625/484) t².

So, putting it all together:

(105625/484) t² - (1250/11) t +5625/224 =78750/3136.

Multiply all terms by 484*224*3136 to eliminate denominators. Wait, that seems messy. Maybe better to bring all terms to left side and find the equation equals to zero.

So, equation:

(105625/484) t² - (1250/11) t +5625/224 -78750/3136=0.

Compute the constant term:

5625/224 -78750/3136.

Find a common denominator of 3136.

5625/224 = (5625*14)/3136=78750/3136.

So, 78750/3136 -78750/3136=0.

So, the equation reduces to:

(105625/484) t² - (1250/11) t=0.

Factor t:

t*(105625/484 t -1250/11 )=0.

Solutions: t=0, which corresponds to point A (10,0), and the other solution is:

105625/484 t -1250/11=0 →105625/484 t=1250/11 →t= (1250/11)*(484/105625).

Simplify:

Compute numerator:1250*484.

Denominator:11*105625.

1250=125*10=25*5*2*5=2*5^4.

484=22^2= (2*11)^2=4*121.

105625= let's see, 100^2=10000, 325^2=105625, because 300^2=90000, 320^2=102400, 325^2=105625.

So, 105625=325^2.

So, t= (1250 *484)/(11 *105625)= ( (2*5^4)*(2^2*11^2) )/(11*(5^2 *13)^2 )).

Wait, let me factor each term:

1250=2 *5^4.

484=2^2 *11^2.

11 is prime.

105625=325^2= (5^2 *13)^2=5^4 *13^2.

So, t= (2*5^4 *2^2 *11^2 ) / (11 *5^4 *13^2 ) = (2^3 *11^2 )/(13^2 )= (8 *121)/169= 968/169.

So, t=968/169.

So, the parameter t is 968/169.

Now, with this t, we can find the coordinates of P.

From parametrization:

x=10 - (235/22) t =10 - (235/22)*(968/169).

Compute (235/22)*(968/169):

First, note that 968 divided by 22: 968 /22=44.

So, 235/22 *968/169=235 *44/169.

Compute 235*44:

235*40=9400, 235*4=940, total=9400+940=10340.

So, 235*44=10340.

So, 235/22 *968/169=10340/169.

So, x=10 -10340/169.

Convert 10 to 1690/169.

So, x=1690/169 -10340/169= (1690 -10340)/169= (-8650)/169.

Simplify: -8650/169. Let me check if this reduces.

Divide numerator and denominator by GCD(8650,169). 169 is 13². 8650 divided by 13: 8650/13=665.38… Not integer. So, it's -8650/169.

Similarly, y= (30 sqrt(14)/11 ) t= (30 sqrt(14)/11)*(968/169).

Compute 30/11 *968/169.

968 divided by 11 is 88.

So, 30/11 *968=30*88=2640.

So, y=2640 sqrt(14)/169.

Thus, point P has coordinates (-8650/169,2640 sqrt(14)/169).

Now, need to compute the distance AP.

Point A is at (10,0), which is (1690/169,0).

Point P is at (-8650/169,2640 sqrt(14)/169).

So, vector AP is ( (-8650/169 -1690/169), 2640 sqrt(14)/169 -0 )= (-10340/169,2640 sqrt(14)/169).

So, distance AP is sqrt[ (-10340/169)^2 + (2640 sqrt(14)/169)^2 ].

Factor out (1/169)^2:

= (1/169) sqrt[ (10340)^2 + (2640^2 *14) ].

Compute inside the sqrt:

First, 10340²: let's compute 1034² first.

Wait, 10340=1034*10, so 10340²=1034² *100.

Compute 1034²:

1034 *1034:

Let me compute step by step.

1000²=1,000,000

2*1000*34=2*1000*34=68,000

34²=1,156

So, (a+b)^2= a² +2ab +b²= (1000+34)^2=1,000,000 +68,000 +1,156=1,069,156.

So, 1034²=1,069,156.

So, 10340²=1,069,156 *100=106,915,600.

Next, compute (2640)^2 *14.

2640²: 264²=69,696. So, 2640²=69,696*100=6,969,600.

Multiply by 14:6,969,600 *14=97,574,400.

So, total inside sqrt is 106,915,600 +97,574,400=204,490,000.

So, sqrt(204,490,000)=sqrt(204,490,000).

Compute sqrt(204,490,000):

Note that 204,490,000=20449 *10,000= (143)^2 *10,000, because 143²=20449.

So, sqrt(20449*10,000)=143*100=14,300.

So, sqrt(204,490,000)=14,300.

Therefore, distance AP= (1/169)*14,300=14,300/169.

Simplify:

14,300 divided by 169: 169*84=14,196. 14,300-14,196=104. 169*0.615≈104.

Wait, let me compute 14,300 ÷169.

Divide 14,300 by 169:

169*80=13,520.

14,300-13,520=780.

169*4=676.

780-676=104.

169*0.615≈104.

But 104 is exactly 169*(104/169)=104/169=8/13.

So, 14,300=169*(80+4) +104=169*84 +104.

So, 14,300/169=84 +104/169=84 + (104/169).

Simplify 104/169: both divided by 13: 104/13=8, 169/13=13. So, 104/169=8/13.

Thus, 14,300/169=84 +8/13=84 8/13= (84*13 +8)/13= (1092 +8)/13=1100/13.

Wait, wait, 84 +8/13= (84*13 +8)/13= (1092 +8)/13=1100/13=84.615...

But 1100/13 is exact.

Wait, but 14,300 divided by 169:

Wait, 169*84=14,196.

14,300-14,196=104.

104/169=8/13.

So, 84 +8/13= (84*13 +8)/13= (1092 +8)/13=1100/13.

Therefore, AP=14,300/169=1100/13.

Wait, that can't be because 1100/13 is approximately 84.615, which is a large distance given the triangle sides are 5,9,10. Wait, this suggests I made a mistake in calculations.

Wait, let me double-check the distance computation.

AP is the distance between A (10,0) and P (-8650/169,2640 sqrt(14)/169).

So, delta x: (-8650/169 -10)= (-8650/169 -1690/169)= (-10340/169).

Delta y:2640 sqrt(14)/169 -0=2640 sqrt(14)/169.

So, AP= sqrt[ (10340/169)^2 + (2640 sqrt(14)/169)^2 ].

Factor out (1/169)^2:

(1/169)*sqrt(10340² + (2640² *14)).

Compute 10340²=106,915,600.

2640²=6,969,600.

6,969,600 *14=97,574,400.

So, sum=106,915,600 +97,574,400=204,490,000.

sqrt(204,490,000)=14,300.

So, AP=14,300/169=84.615 approx.

But in the triangle, AP being longer than the sides of the triangle is possible because P is outside the triangle? Wait, but in the Asymptote code, P is drawn as a point on the circle, so it's possible.

Wait, but with AP=1100/13≈84.615, which is approximately 84.615, which is much larger than the sides. But the sides are 5,9,10.

Wait, that seems too large. Maybe I made a mistake in the coordinate system.

Wait, let me check the coordinates of point P.

Point P is at (-8650/169,2640 sqrt(14)/169). Let me compute these as decimals:

-8650/169≈-8650/169≈-51.2 (since 169*51=8619, 169*51.2≈8650).

2640 sqrt(14)/169≈2640*3.7417/169≈2640*3.7417≈9900, 9900/169≈58.52.

So, point P is at approximately (-51.2,58.52), which is quite far from A at (10,0). So, the distance AP would be sqrt( (10 - (-51.2))² + (0 -58.52)^2 )=sqrt(61.2² +58.52² )≈sqrt(3745 +3425)=sqrt(7170)≈84.68, which matches 14,300/169≈84.615.

Hmm, but the problem states that AP is to be written as m/n where m and n are coprime. So, 14,300/169 reduces.

Wait, 14,300 divided by 169: let's see, 169*84=14,196, as before. 14,300-14,196=104. So, 14,300=169*84 +104.

104=169*(104/169)=8/13.

So, 14,300/169=84 +8/13= (84*13 +8)/13= (1092 +8)/13=1100/13.

So, 1100/13 is the reduced form, as 1100 and 13 are coprime (13 is prime, doesn't divide 1100).

Therefore, AP=1100/13, so m=1100, n=13. m and n are coprime, so m +n=1100 +13=1113.

Wait, but 1100/13 is approximately 84.615, which seems very large, but perhaps it's correct.

Wait, but let me think: point P is on the circumcircle, on the opposite side of A relative to D, so it's possible that AP is longer than the sides.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculations earlier on. Let me quickly go through the steps again.

Wait, when I computed t=968/169, which is approximately 5.74, which is the parameter beyond point D (since D is at t=1: from A to D is t=0 to t=1. So, t=5.74 would be beyond D, meaning P is beyond D on the extension of AD. So, that would make AP longer than AD, which might explain the large distance.

Alternatively, perhaps I should have considered negative t, but in the parametrization, t=0 is at A, t=1 is at D, so t>1 would be beyond D, which is consistent with P being on the other side.

Wait, but in the Asymptote code, P is drawn as a point on the circle, so perhaps it's correct.

Alternatively, perhaps there's a smarter way to compute AP using power of a point.

Earlier, I had the equation DB²=DA * DP.

If I can compute DB and DA, I can find DP, then find AP=DA - DP.

Wait, let's try that.

First, compute DB.

Point D is at (-15/22,30 sqrt(14)/11).

Point B is at (39/5,6 sqrt(14)/5).

So, distance DB squared is:

(39/5 - (-15/22))² + (6 sqrt(14)/5 -30 sqrt(14)/11 )².

Compute each term.

First, x-coordinate difference:

39/5 - (-15/22)=39/5 +15/22= (39*22 +15*5)/(5*22)= (858 +75)/110=933/110.

Second, y-coordinate difference:

6 sqrt(14)/5 -30 sqrt(14)/11= sqrt(14)*(6/5 -30/11)= sqrt(14)*(66/55 -150/55)= sqrt(14)*(-84/55).

So, DB²= (933/110)^2 + ( -84 sqrt(14)/55 )^2.

Compute each:

(933/110)^2= (933^2)/(110^2).

933^2: compute 900²=810,000, 33²=1,089, cross term 2*900*33=59,400. So, (900+33)^2=810,000 +59,400 +1,089=870,489.

So, (933/110)^2=870,489/12,100.

( -84 sqrt(14)/55 )^2= (84^2 *14)/(55^2)= (7056 *14)/3025=98,784/3025.

So, DB²=870,489/12,100 +98,784/3025.

Convert to same denominator: 12,100 is 121*100, 3025 is 55²=3025. Let's convert 98,784/3025 to denominator 12,100.

Multiply numerator and denominator by 4: 98,784*4=395,136; 3025*4=12,100.

So, DB²=870,489/12,100 +395,136/12,100= (870,489 +395,136)/12,100=1,265,625/12,100.

Simplify 1,265,625 ÷25=50,625; 12,100 ÷25=484.

So, 50,625/484. Check if reducible: 50,625=25^2 *81=625*81. 484=22². No common factors. So, DB²=50,625/484.

So, DB= sqrt(50,625/484)=225/22.

Because sqrt(50,625)=225, sqrt(484)=22.

So, DB=225/22.

Now, compute DA.

Point D is at (-15/22,30 sqrt(14)/11), point A is at (10,0).

Distance DA squared is:

(10 - (-15/22))² + (0 -30 sqrt(14)/11 )².

Compute each term:

x-difference:10 +15/22= (220 +15)/22=235/22.

y-difference: -30 sqrt(14)/11.

So, DA²=(235/22)^2 + (30 sqrt(14)/11)^2.

Compute:

(235)^2=55,225, so (55,225)/(484).

(30 sqrt(14))^2=900*14=12,600, over 121.

So, DA²=55,225/484 +12,600/121.

Convert 12,600/121 to denominator 484: multiply numerator and denominator by4: 50,400/484.

So, DA²=55,225/484 +50,400/484=105,625/484.

So, DA= sqrt(105,625/484)=325/22.

Because sqrt(105,625)=325, sqrt(484)=22.

So, DA=325/22.

Now, from power of a point: DB²=DA * DP.

We have DB²= (225/22)^2=50,625/484.

DA=325/22.

So,

50,625/484 = (325/22) * DP.

Solve for DP:

DP= (50,625/484) / (325/22)= (50,625/484) * (22/325)= (50,625 *22)/(484 *325).

Simplify:

50,625 ÷25=2025; 325 ÷25=13.

22 ÷2=11; 484 ÷2=242.

Wait, perhaps factor more.

50,625=225²= (15²)²=15^4.

22=2*11.

484=22²= (2*11)^2=4*121.

325=25*13.

So,

DP= (15^4 *2*11)/(4*121 *25*13).

Simplify:

15^4=5^4 *3^4.

So,

DP= (5^4 *3^4 *2 *11)/(4 *11² *5² *13).

Simplify terms:

5^4 /5²=5²=25.

3^4 remains.

2 remains.

11 in numerator cancels one 11 in denominator (11²).

4 remains.

13 remains.

So,

DP= (25 *81 *2 )/(4 *11 *13).

Compute numerator:25*81=2025, 2025*2=4050.

Denominator:4*11=44, 44*13=572.

So, DP=4050/572.

Simplify:

Divide numerator and denominator by 2:2025/286.

Check if reducible: 286=2*11*13. 2025 divided by 11: 2025/11=184.09… Not integer. So, 2025 and 286 are coprime.

So, DP=2025/286.

Then, AP=DA - DP= (325/22) - (2025/286).

Convert to common denominator:286=13*22.

So, 325/22= (325*13)/286=4225/286.

Thus, AP=4225/286 -2025/286= (4225 -2025)/286=2200/286.

Simplify:

2200 ÷2=1100; 286 ÷2=143.

So, AP=1100/143.

Wait, but earlier I had AP=1100/13 via coordinate method. Now, via power of a point, I have AP=1100/143.

Hmm, that's conflicting. So, I must have made a mistake in one of the approaches.

Wait, wait, let me check the power of a point calculation again.

From power of a point: DB²= DA * DP.

We have DB=225/22, so DB²= (225/22)^2=50625/484.

DA=325/22.

So, DP= DB² / DA= (50625/484) / (325/22)= (50625/484)*(22/325)= (50625*22)/(484*325).

Compute numerator:50625*22=1,113,750.

Denominator:484*325=157,300.

So, DP=1,113,750 /157,300.

Simplify:

Divide numerator and denominator by 50:22,275 /3,146.

Wait, 22,275 ÷13=1713.46… Not integer. Maybe check if 22,275 and3,146 have a common factor.

Wait, 3,146=2*1573. 1573 is a prime? Let me check: 1573 ÷11=143, which is 11*13. So, 1573=11*143=11*(11*13)=11²*13. So, 3,146=2*11²*13.

22,275: 22,275 ÷25=891. 891=9*99=9*9*11. So, 22,275=25*9*9*11=25*81*11.

So, 22,275=5²*3^4*11.

3,146=2*11²*13.

So, common factors: 11.

So, divide numerator and denominator by 11:

22,275 ÷11=2025.

3,146 ÷11=286.

So, DP=2025/286.

So, yes, DP=2025/286.

Then, AP=DA - DP=325/22 -2025/286.

Convert 325/22 to 286 denominator: 325=25*13, 22=2*11.

286=2*11*13.

So, 325/22= (25*13)/(2*11)= (25*13*13)/(2*11*13)= (25*169)/286=4225/286.

So, AP=4225/286 -2025/286=2200/286=1100/143.

So, AP=1100/143.

Now, 1100 and 143: 143=11*13. 1100=100*11=2²*5²*11.

So, 1100 and143 share a common factor of 11.

Divide numerator and denominator by11:1100 ÷11=100, 143 ÷11=13.

So, AP=100/13.

Wait, what? That can't be. Wait, 1100 ÷11=100, 143 ÷11=13.

So, AP=100/13.

Wait, that's different from the previous 1100/13.

Wait, but 100/13 is approximately7.692, which is more reasonable given the triangle sides.

So, where did I go wrong earlier?

Wait, in the power of a point approach, I have:

AP=DA - DP=325/22 -2025/286= (4225 -2025)/286=2200/286=1100/143=100/13.

Ah, yes, because 2200 ÷22=100, 286 ÷22=13.

Wait, 2200 ÷22=100, 286 ÷22=13. So, 2200/286=100/13.

So, AP=100/13.

Earlier, in the coordinate method, I had AP=1100/13, which is 84.615, but via power of a point, I get 100/13≈7.692, which is more reasonable.

So, that suggests that I made a mistake in the coordinate approach. Let me see where.

Wait, in the coordinate approach, I found point P at (-8650/169,2640 sqrt(14)/169). Then, computed the distance between A (10,0) and P.

Wait, perhaps I made an error in the parametrization step.

Wait, when I parametrized AD, I set t=0 at A, t=1 at D.

But when I solved for t, I got t=968/169≈5.74, which is beyond D (which is at t=1). So, point P is beyond D on the line AD.

But according to the Asymptote code, point P is on the circle, but in the drawing, P is between A and D, but perhaps it's actually on the other side.

Wait, no, in the Asymptote code, AD is drawn from A to D, and then the circle is drawn, so P is the intersection beyond D.

Wait, in the Asymptote code, P is the intersection of AD with the circle, so if AD is extended beyond D, it would intersect the circle again at P.

So, in that case, AP would be AD + DP.

Wait, but in the power of a point, the formula is DB²=DA * DP.

Where DA is the distance from D to A, and DP is the distance from D to P along the same line.

If P is beyond D, then DA is from D to A, and DP is from D to P, but in opposite directions.

Wait, perhaps I have a sign issue in the power of a point formula.

Wait, the power of a point D with respect to ω is equal to DB²=DP * DQ, where DP and DQ are the lengths from D to P and D to Q, with P and Q being the intersection points of line DPQ with ω.

If P is on one side, and Q is on the other, but in this case, line AD intersects ω at A and P.

Wait, but in the parametrization, A is at t=0, D is at t=1, and P is at t=968/169≈5.74.

So, DA is the segment from D to A, length 325/22≈14.77. DP is from D to P, which is beyond D, so DP is longer than DA.

But according to the power of a point, DB²=DP * DA.

If P is beyond D, then DA is from D to A (towards the circle), and DP is from D to P (away from the circle). So, the lengths would be directed segments.

Wait, perhaps in the power of a point formula, it's signed lengths. If so, then DA is negative if P is on the opposite side.

Wait, but I think the formula is for magnitudes.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider that DA is the length from D to A, and DP is the length from D to P, but since P is beyond D, DP=DA + AP.

Wait, no, because in the power of a point, the formula is DB²=DP * DQ, where DP and DQ are the lengths from D to P and D to Q along the line, regardless of direction.

But in our case, line DP intersects the circle at A and P, with A between D and P, or P between D and A?

Wait, in the Asymptote code, it's drawn as A connected to D, and P is the intersection beyond D.

So, the line AD starts at A, goes through D, and then intersects the circle again at P.

Wait, but the circle is the circumcircle of ABC, so point A is on the circle, D is outside, so line AD passes through A (on the circle) and D (outside), then exits the circle again at another point P.

Wait, that would mean that P is between A and D, not beyond D.

But in my parametrization earlier, t=0 is at A, t=1 at D, and solving gave t=968/169≈5.74, which is beyond D.

But according to the Asymptote code, point P is on the line AD, which is drawn from A to D, and then P is on the circle. So, perhaps P is between A and D, which would mean t is between 0 and 1.

Wait, but in the equation we solved, we had:

(105625/484) t² - (1250/11) t=0.

Solutions t=0 and t=(1250/11)/(105625/484)= (1250/11)*(484/105625)= as before 968/169≈5.74.

Which would suggest that the only intersections are at t=0 (A) and t≈5.74 (P beyond D). But that contradicts the Asymptote code which suggests P is between A and D.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the parametrization.

Wait, in the parametrization, I set x=10 - (235/22) t, which is correct because from A (10,0) moving towards D (-15/22, ...), so the x-coordinate decreases as t increases.

But when I solved for t, I only got t=0 and t≈5.74, which suggests that the line AD only intersects the circle at A and beyond D at P.

But according to the problem statement, P is the intersection point when you extend AD beyond D, so perhaps P is indeed beyond D.

But in that case, why did the Asymptote code draw P as a point on the circle along AD from A to D?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the parametrization direction.

Wait, perhaps the parametrization should have t=0 at D and t=1 at A, so that t>1 would go beyond A.

But in that case, point P would be on the extension beyond A, but that would not make sense as per the problem statement.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the substitution.

Wait, let me think again. The line AD is parameterized as starting at A (t=0), going towards D (t=1), and beyond. The circle is the circumcircle, so when you draw line AD from A through D, it will intersect the circle again at another point P beyond D.

Thus, in the parametrization, P is indeed at t≈5.74, beyond D.

But then, the length AP would be the distance from A to P, which would be the distance from A to D plus the distance from D to P.

But according to power of a point, DB²=DA * DP.

DA is from D to A, which is 325/22.

DP is from D to P, which is 2025/286.

So, AP=DA + DP=325/22 +2025/286.

Compute:

Convert to common denominator:286.

325/22= (325*13)/286=4225/286.

2025/286 is as is.

So, AP=4225/286 +2025/286=6250/286=3125/143.

Simplify:

3125 ÷13≈240.38, but 3125 is 5^5, 143 is11*13.

So, 3125 and143 are coprime? 3125 is 5^5, 143 is11*13, so yes, coprime.

Thus, AP=3125/143≈21.85.

But that conflicts with the power of a point approach earlier.

Wait, but earlier, using power of a point, I found AP=100/13≈7.69.

Hmm, now I'm really confused.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the parametrization.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use inversion or another method.

Wait, but given that, perhaps the correct answer is 100/13, as per the power of a point approach, since it's a more straightforward method.

Wait, to resolve this, let's compute AP via both methods and see.

From the coordinate approach, I have AP=1100/13≈84.615.

From the power of a point approach, AP=100/13≈7.692.

But these are vastly different.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the coordinate approach in the calculation of the parametrization.

Wait, let me recompute the parametrization.

From parametrization:

x=10 - (235/22)t

y= (30 sqrt(14)/11 )t

Substituting into the circle equation, I get:

(x -5)^2 + (y -5 sqrt(14)/56)^2 = (75 sqrt(14)/56)^2.

Which after substitution led to:

(105625/484) t² - (1250/11) t=0.

Solutions t=0 and t=968/169≈5.74.

But according to the power of a point, AP=100/13≈7.69.

Wait, perhaps the parametrization is correct, but the distance AP is not DA + DP, but something else.

Wait, from the parametrization, AP is the distance from A to P, which is for t=968/169.

So, in parametrization, the distance from A is the distance from (10,0) to (x(t), y(t)).

Which is sqrt[ (x(t)-10)^2 + (y(t)-0)^2 ].

But x(t)=10 - (235/22)t, so x(t)-10= - (235/22)t.

y(t)= (30 sqrt(14)/11 )t.

So, distance AP= sqrt[ (235/22 t)^2 + (30 sqrt(14)/11 t)^2 ].

Factor t^2:

= t * sqrt[ (235/22)^2 + (30 sqrt(14)/11)^2 ].

Compute the expression inside sqrt:

(235/22)^2 + (30 sqrt(14)/11)^2= (55,225)/(484) + (900*14)/(121)=55,225/484 +12,600/121.

Convert 12,600/121 to 484 denominator: multiply numerator and denominator by4:50,400/484.

So, total inside sqrt= (55,225 +50,400)/484=105,625/484.

So, sqrt(105,625/484)=325/22.

Thus, AP= t*(325/22).

From the solution, t=968/169.

So, AP= (968/169)*(325/22)= (968*325)/(169*22).

Simplify:

Compute 968 ÷22=44.

325 ÷169=25/13.

So, AP=44*(25/13)=1100/13.

So, AP=1100/13≈84.615.

Therefore, the coordinate method gives AP=1100/13, but the power of a point approach gave me AP=100/13. So, one of the methods must be wrong.

Wait, but in the power of a point approach, I used DB²=DA * DP.

But from the coordinate method, DA=325/22, DP=2025/286, and DA * DP= (325/22)*(2025/286)= (325*2025)/(22*286)= (658,125)/(6,292)= approximately104.59.

But DB²= (225/22)^2=50,625/484≈104.59.

So, 50,625/484=104.59, which equals DA * DP=325/22 *2025/286≈14.77 *7.08≈104.59.

So, that's correct.

But then, AP=DA - DP=325/22 -2025/286= (4225 -2025)/286=2200/286=1100/143≈7.692.

But according to the coordinate method, AP=1100/13≈84.615.

But 1100/13≈84.615, which is much larger than the sides of the triangle, which is possible, but the power of a point approach gives a different answer.

Wait, perhaps the confusion is in the direction of DP.

Wait, in the power of a point formula, the lengths are considered as signed distances if we're dealing with directed segments.

If P is on the extension beyond D, then DP is negative if we consider DA as positive.

Wait, perhaps in the power of a point formula, it's DB²=DA * DP, where DA and DP are signed lengths.

If P is beyond D, then DP is negative relative to DA.

So, if DA is positive, DP would be negative.

So, DB²=DA*(-DP).

Therefore, DB²= -DA * DP.

Thus, DP= -DB² / DA.

So, DP= -(50,625/484)/(325/22)= -(50,625/484)*(22/325)= -(50,625*22)/(484*325)= - (1,113,750)/(157,300)= - (1,113,750 ÷50)/(157,300 ÷50)= -22,275/3,146.

Simplify:

22,275 ÷13=1,713.461… Not integer. Wait, 22,275=25*891=25*9*99=25*9*9*11.

3,146=2*1573=2*(11*143)=2*11*(11*13).

So, common factors:11.

Divide numerator and denominator by 11:

22,275 ÷11=2,025.

3,146 ÷11=286.

So, DP= -2,025/286.

Thus, AP=DA + DP=325/22 + (-2,025/286)= (325/22) - (2,025/286).

As before, 325/22=4,225/286.

So, AP=4,225/286 -2,025/286=2,200/286=1,100/143=100/13.

So, AP=100/13.

Therefore, the correct answer is 100/13, which is approximately7.692.

Thus, the coordinate approach had a mistake, likely in the parametrization direction or in the interpretation of the power of a point formula.

Therefore, the correct value of AP is 100/13, so m=100, n=13, and m +n=113.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To solve the problem, we use the power of a point theorem. Let \( D \) be the intersection of the tangents at \( B \) and \( C \). The power of point \( D \) with respect to the circumcircle \( \omega \) is \( DB^2 = DC^2 \). Let \( P \) be the second intersection of line \( AD \) with the circumcircle. By the power of a point theorem, \( DB^2 = DA \cdot DP \).

Given triangle \( ABC \) with sides \( AB = 5 \), \( BC = 9 \), and \( AC = 10 \), we first compute the circumradius \( R \) of \( ABC \). Using the formula \( R = \frac{abc}{4K} \), where \( K \) is the area of the triangle, we find \( R = \frac{75\sqrt{14}}{56} \).

Next, we compute the coordinates of points \( A \), \( B \), \( C \), and \( D \). Point \( D \) is found by solving the equations of the tangents at \( B \) and \( C \). Using coordinate geometry, we determine the coordinates of \( D \) as \( \left( -\frac{15}{22}, \frac{30\sqrt{14}}{11} \right) \).

We then find the equation of line \( AD \) and determine its intersection with the circumcircle, which gives the coordinates of \( P \). Using the distance formula, we compute \( AP \).

However, a more straightforward approach using the power of a point theorem avoids complex coordinate calculations. We find \( DB \) and \( DA \) using distance formulas and apply the power of a point theorem to find \( DP \). Finally, we compute \( AP = DA - DP \), leading to the result \( AP = \frac{100}{13} \).

Thus, \( AP \) can be written as \( \frac{100}{13} \), and \( m + n = 100 + 13 = 113 \).

\boxed{113}
