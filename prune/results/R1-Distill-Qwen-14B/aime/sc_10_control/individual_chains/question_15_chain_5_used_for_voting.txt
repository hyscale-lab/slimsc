Alright, so I've got this math problem here about counting paths on an 8x8 grid. The paths are from the lower left corner to the upper right corner, and they have to be of length 16. Also, these paths can only move along the grid lines, which means they can either go right or up. The catch is that they have to change direction exactly four times. Hmm, okay.

Let me first visualize the grid. An 8x8 grid has 8 rows and 8 columns, so moving from the lower left to the upper right requires moving 8 steps to the right and 8 steps up. So, any path will consist of a sequence of rights (R) and ups (U), totaling 16 moves. But the paths can't just be any sequence; they have to change direction exactly four times. 

Wait, changing direction... So, each time the path switches from R to U or U to R, that's a direction change. The problem states exactly four such changes. I think this means that the path alternates between R and U segments, each segment being a consecutive sequence of the same move. So, for example, a path might go R, R, U, U, U, R, R, R, U, U, R, R, U, U, U, U, but wait, that's more than four changes. Let me think.

If a path changes direction four times, that would divide the path into five segments, right? Because each direction change starts a new segment. So, starting with either R or U, each subsequent change alternates the direction. So, if you have four changes, the number of segments would be five.

But wait, in an 8x8 grid, the path must end at the upper right corner, which is (8,8). So, the number of R's and U's must each be 8. So, the path is a sequence of 8 R's and 8 U's, arranged in such a way that they change direction exactly four times.

So, for example, a path that starts with R, then U, then R, then U, then R, that would have three direction changes, resulting in four segments. Wait, no: Starting with R, then changing to U (1 change), then back to R (2), then to U (3), then to R (4). So that's four changes, making five segments. So, the path alternates directions each time, starting with either R or U, and ends with either R or U.

But wait, the total number of direction changes is four, so the number of runs (segments) is five. Each run is a consecutive sequence of R's or U's. So, each segment must consist of at least one step. So, if we have five segments, each of them must have at least one step.

But we have 8 R's and 8 U's to distribute among these segments. Since the path alternates between R and U, the number of R segments and U segments will depend on whether the path starts with R or U.

Case 1: The path starts with R. Then, the segments will be R, U, R, U, R, U, R, U, R. Wait, that's nine segments, but we only have five segments for four changes. Hmm, wait, no. Let me correct that.

Wait, no, if the path starts with R, then each change alternates the direction. So, if there are four changes, the number of segments is five. So, starting with R, the segments would be R, U, R, U, R. So, three R segments and two U segments, or the other way around if starting with U.

So, let's think: if the path starts with R, then the number of R segments is three, and U segments is two. Because each change flips the direction, so starting with R, the segments would be R, U, R, U, R. So, five segments: three R and two U.

Similarly, if the path starts with U, the segments would be U, R, U, R, U. So, three U and two R segments.

So, depending on the starting direction, the number of runs for each direction is different.

So, our problem is to count all such sequences of R and U with exactly four direction changes (hence five segments) that sum up to 8 R's and 8 U's.

So, let's model this.

If the path starts with R, then we have three R segments and two U segments. Each R segment must have at least one R, and each U segment must have at least one U. So, the number of ways to distribute the R's is the number of solutions to a + b + c = 8, where a, b, c are positive integers. Similarly for the U's: d + e = 8, where d, e are positive integers.

Similarly, if the path starts with U, then we have three U segments and two R segments. So, the number of ways to distribute U's is the number of solutions to x + y + z = 8, and R's to m + n =8.

So, the total number of paths starting with R is equal to the number of ways to distribute R's into three segments multiplied by the number of ways to distribute U's into two segments.

Similarly for paths starting with U: number of ways to distribute U's into three segments multiplied by number of ways to distribute R's into two segments.

So, the number of ways to distribute 'n' identical items into 'k' distinct segments, each with at least one item, is given by the combination formula C(n-1, k-1). Because it's equivalent to placing k-1 dividers among n-1 spaces between the items.

So, for distributing R's into three segments: C(8-1,3-1) = C(7,2) = 21.

Similarly, distributing U's into two segments: C(8-1,2-1) = C(7,1) =7.

So, the total number of paths starting with R is 21 * 7 = 147.

Similarly, for paths starting with U: distributing U's into three segments is C(7,2)=21, and R's into two segments is C(7,1)=7. So, 21 *7=147.

Therefore, the total number of such paths is 147 + 147 = 294.

Wait, but hold on a second. Is that all? Because I might have made a mistake here.

Wait, the initial assumption is that the direction changes exactly four times, regardless of starting direction. So, we considered both starting with R and starting with U. Each contributes 147, so total 294.

But let me make sure I didn't miss any constraints.

Wait, but in the problem statement, it says "change direction exactly four times," which would correspond to five segments, as we have. So, each path must have exactly five segments, which is either starting with R and having three R and two U segments, or starting with U and having three U and two R segments.

But wait, another thought: when we say 'change direction exactly four times,' does that mean that the number of runs is five, which is correct. But perhaps we need to ensure that the last segment is of certain direction? Because in some grid problems, the number of direction changes can be counted differently.

Wait, no, in the way we modeled it, starting with R and ending with R would have four changes, right? Let me count: starting R, change 1: U, change 2: R, change 3: U, change 4: R. So, five segments: R, U, R, U, R. So four changes, starting and ending with R.

Similarly, starting with U, four changes would end with U.

Wait, but in our calculation, both starting R and starting U contribute equally. So, that seems correct.

Therefore, adding both cases, 147 + 147 = 294.

But I'm a bit concerned because I remember that in similar grid problems, sometimes the number of paths with exactly k direction changes is calculated using combinations, but maybe I need to think differently.

Alternatively, perhaps the number of such paths is equal to 2 * C(7,2) * C(7,2) or something else.

Wait, wait, let's think again.

If the path starts with R, then the number of R segments is three, each with at least one R, and the number of U segments is two, each with at least one U.

So, the number of ways to distribute R's is C(8-1,3-1) = C(7,2) =21.

Similarly, the number of ways for U's is C(8-1,2-1)=C(7,1)=7.

So, 21 *7=147.

Same for starting with U: C(7,2) for U's and C(7,1) for R's, so 21 *7=147.

Thus, total 294.

Wait, but let me think about another approach. For a path with exactly four direction changes, the number of runs is five. So, the number of runs is five, which can either start with R or U.

Each run must have at least one step. So, the number of ways is 2 * [C(7,4) * C(7,4)]?

Wait, no, maybe that's not the right way. Or perhaps, considering the number of compositions.

Wait, another approach: the number of compositions of 8 into k parts is C(7, k-1). So, for R's, if we have three runs, that's C(7,2)=21. For U's, two runs, C(7,1)=7. So, for starting with R, total is 21 *7=147. Similarly for starting with U, 147. So, total 294.

That matches my earlier calculation.

So, I think 294 is the correct answer.

Wait, but let me think if I can find another way to model this.

Alternatively, the total number of monotonic paths (without any direction changes) is C(16,8) = 12870. But that's all possible paths without considering the direction changes.

But the problem is asking for the number of paths with exactly four direction changes, so 294.

Wait, but to cross-verify, suppose we have a smaller grid, say 2x2 grid, and count the number of paths from (0,0) to (2,2) with exactly two direction changes.

In this case, what's the answer?

A 2x2 grid: so, moving from (0,0) to (2,2), the path has four moves: two R's and two U's.

Number of direction changes: exactly two.

So, how many such paths?

Each path must change direction exactly two times, which would correspond to three segments.

So, starting with R: R, U, R. So, two R segments and one U segment.

Number of ways: distributing two R's into two segments: each at least one. So, C(2-1,2-1)=C(1,1)=1 for R's. Similarly, distributing two U's into one segment: only one way. So, total for starting with R: 1*1=1.

Similarly, starting with U: distributing two U's into two segments: C(1,1)=1, and R's into one segment:1. So, starting with U: 1.

Total paths: 2.

But let's count manually. The paths with exactly two direction changes in a 2x2 grid are:

1. R, R, U, U → change at step 2 (from R to U) → one change. Wait, that's only one change, so that's not two changes.

Wait, wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the direction changes.

Wait, in a 2x2 grid, each path from (0,0) to (2,2) consists of two R's and two U's.

Let me list all such paths:

1. R, R, U, U: changes once (from R to U)
2. R, U, R, U: changes three times
3. R, U, U, R: changes twice
4. U, R, R, U: changes twice
5. U, R, U, R: changes three times
6. U, U, R, R: changes once

So, paths 3 and 4 have exactly two direction changes.

So, there are two such paths.

Which matches our earlier calculation: 2.

So, in the 2x2 grid, the number of paths with exactly two direction changes is 2, which is equal to 2 * [C(1,1) * C(1,0)] -- wait, no, perhaps not. Wait, no. Wait, in that case, for a 2x2 grid, starting with R: number of R segments is two, U segments is one. So, distributing R's: 2 R's into two segments: C(1,1)=1. U's: 2 U's into one segment: 1. So, 1 *1=1. Similarly, starting with U: same, 1. So, total 2.

So, that seems correct.

So, in the original problem, 8x8 grid, similar logic applies, leading to 294.

Another way to think about it: the number of paths with exactly four direction changes is twice the number of compositions for each case.

So, yeah, I think 294 is the correct answer.

To solve the problem of counting the number of paths from the lower left corner to the upper right corner of an $8 \times 8$ grid that change direction exactly four times, we analyze the structure of such paths.

A path with exactly four direction changes consists of five segments, alternating between right (R) and up (U) moves. The path can either start with an R or a U, leading to two distinct cases:

1. **Starting with R**: This results in three R segments and two U segments. Each segment must contain at least one move.
2. **Starting with U**: This results in three U segments and two R segments, each containing at least one move.

For each case, we calculate the number of ways to distribute the moves:

- Distributing 8 R's into 3 segments: $\binom{8-1}{3-1} = \binom{7}{2} = 21$ ways.
- Distributing 8 U's into 2 segments: $\binom{8-1}{2-1} = \binom{7}{1} = 7$ ways.

Thus, for paths starting with R, there are $21 \times 7 = 147$ valid paths. Similarly, for paths starting with U, there are also $21 \times 7 = 147$ valid paths.

Adding both cases together, the total number of paths is:

\[
147 + 147 = 294
\]

Therefore, the number of paths that change direction exactly four times is $\boxed{294}$.
