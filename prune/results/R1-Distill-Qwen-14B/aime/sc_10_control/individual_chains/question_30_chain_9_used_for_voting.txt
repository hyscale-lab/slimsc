Okay, so I have this problem here: Let ω ≠ 1 be a 13th root of unity. I need to find the remainder when the product from k=0 to 12 of (2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k}) is divided by 1000. Hmm, that sounds a bit intimidating at first, but let me try to break it down step by step.

First, I remember that roots of unity are complex numbers that satisfy ω^n = 1 for some integer n. In this case, ω is a primitive 13th root of unity because it's specified that ω ≠ 1. So, ω^13 = 1, and any lower exponent won't give 1. That's good to know.

The expression we have is a product over k from 0 to 12 of (2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k}). Let me denote each term in the product as f(k) = 2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k}. So, the product is Π_{k=0}^{12} f(k).

Hmm, I wonder if I can simplify each f(k). Let me see: f(k) = 2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k}. Let me factor this expression or maybe recognize it as a quadratic in ω^k. Let's write it as: f(k) = ω^{2k} - 2ω^k + 2. That looks a bit like a quadratic equation. Maybe I can factor it or find its roots.

Let me think of it as a quadratic in x = ω^k: x² - 2x + 2. Then f(k) = x² - 2x + 2. Let me compute the discriminant to see if it factors nicely. The discriminant D is (2)^2 - 4*1*2 = 4 - 8 = -4. So, the roots are complex: [2 ± sqrt(-4)]/2 = [2 ± 2i]/2 = 1 ± i. So, x² - 2x + 2 = (x - (1 + i))(x - (1 - i)).

Therefore, f(k) = (ω^k - (1 + i))(ω^k - (1 - i)). So, each term in the product is factored into two terms. So, the entire product becomes Π_{k=0}^{12} (ω^k - (1 + i))(ω^k - (1 - i)).

Wait, so we can separate the product into two products: one involving (ω^k - (1 + i)) and the other involving (ω^k - (1 - i)). So, the product is [Π_{k=0}^{12} (ω^k - (1 + i))] * [Π_{k=0}^{12} (ω^k - (1 - i))].

Now, I recall that for roots of unity, the product Π_{k=0}^{n-1} (x - ω^k) = x^n - 1. But wait, in our case, each product is Π_{k=0}^{12} (ω^k - a), where a is a constant. Let me see, for a general a, Π_{k=0}^{12} (ω^k - a). Hmm.

But since ω is a primitive 13th root, the minimal polynomial is the cyclotomic polynomial Φ_13(x) = x^12 + x^11 + ... + x + 1. Wait, but I might need a different approach here.

Alternatively, I remember that Π_{k=0}^{n-1} (x - ω^k) = x^n - 1. So, if we set x = a, then Π_{k=0}^{n-1} (a - ω^k) = a^n - 1. So, in our case, n=13, so Π_{k=0}^{12} (a - ω^k) = a^13 - 1.

Wait, but in our case, the product is Π (ω^k - a) = (-1)^13 Π (a - ω^k) = - Π (a - ω^k) = -(a^13 - 1). Because 13 is odd, so (-1)^13 is -1.

Therefore, each product Π_{k=0}^{12} (ω^k - a) = -(a^13 - 1) = 1 - a^13.

So, applying that to our problem, each of the two products is 1 - a^13, where a is (1 + i) and (1 - i), respectively.

Therefore, the total product is [1 - (1 + i)^13] * [1 - (1 - i)^13].

So, now I need to compute (1 + i)^13 and (1 - i)^13.

I know that 1 + i can be represented in polar form. Let me recall that 1 + i = sqrt(2) * e^{iπ/4}, since its magnitude is sqrt(1^2 + 1^2) = sqrt(2), and its angle is 45 degrees or π/4 radians.

Similarly, 1 - i = sqrt(2) * e^{-iπ/4}.

So, raising them to the 13th power:

(1 + i)^13 = [sqrt(2)]^13 * e^{i * 13 * π/4}.

Similarly, (1 - i)^13 = [sqrt(2)]^13 * e^{-i * 13 * π/4}.

Let me compute [sqrt(2)]^13 first. sqrt(2) is 2^{1/2}, so (2^{1/2})^13 = 2^{13/2} = 2^6 * 2^{1/2} = 64 * sqrt(2).

Now, the exponents: 13 * π/4. Let me compute 13 * π/4 modulo 2π, because angles are periodic with period 2π.

13 divided by 8 is 1 with a remainder of 5, because 8*1=8, 13-8=5. So, 13 * π/4 = (8 + 5) * π/4 = 2π + (5π/4). So, e^{i * 13π/4} = e^{i * (2π + 5π/4)} = e^{i *5π/4} because e^{i * 2π} = 1.

Similarly, e^{-i *13π/4} = e^{-i*(5π/4)}.

So, e^{i *5π/4} is cos(5π/4) + i sin(5π/4) = (-sqrt(2)/2 - i sqrt(2)/2). Similarly, e^{-i *5π/4} is cos(5π/4) - i sin(5π/4) = (-sqrt(2)/2 + i sqrt(2)/2).

Wait, actually, cos(5π/4) is -sqrt(2)/2, and sin is -sqrt(2)/2. So, e^{i *5π/4} is -sqrt(2)/2 - i sqrt(2)/2, and e^{-i *5π/4} is -sqrt(2)/2 + i sqrt(2)/2.

So, putting it all together:

(1 + i)^13 = 64 * sqrt(2) * (-sqrt(2)/2 - i sqrt(2)/2).

Let me compute that: 64 * sqrt(2) multiplied by (-sqrt(2)/2 - i sqrt(2)/2).

First, sqrt(2) * (-sqrt(2)/2) = - (2)/2 = -1. Similarly, sqrt(2) * (-i sqrt(2)/2) = -i (2)/2 = -i.

So, 64*( -1 - i ) = -64 - 64i.

Similarly, (1 - i)^13 = 64 * sqrt(2) * (-sqrt(2)/2 + i sqrt(2)/2).

Again, sqrt(2) * (-sqrt(2)/2) = -1, and sqrt(2) * (i sqrt(2)/2) = i.

So, 64*(-1 + i) = -64 + 64i.

So, now, going back to the product:

[1 - (1 + i)^13] * [1 - (1 - i)^13] = [1 - (-64 -64i)] * [1 - (-64 +64i)].

Simplify each bracket:

First bracket: 1 - (-64 -64i) = 1 +64 +64i = 65 +64i.

Second bracket: 1 - (-64 +64i) = 1 +64 -64i = 65 -64i.

So, the product is (65 +64i)(65 -64i). That's a product of a complex number and its conjugate, so it's equal to (65)^2 + (64)^2.

Compute 65^2: 65*65 = 4225.

Compute 64^2: 4096.

Adding them together: 4225 + 4096 = 8321.

So, the total product is 8321.

Wait, but the problem says ω ≠ 1 is a 13th root of unity, so we're taking k from 0 to 12, including k=0. When k=0, ω^0=1, so let's check what f(0) is.

f(0) = 2 - 2*1 + 1 = 2 -2 +1 =1. So, in the product, one of the terms is 1. But when we computed the product as [1 - (1 + i)^13][1 - (1 - i)^13], we might have missed the k=0 term? Wait, no, because when k=0, the term is 1, but when we wrote the product as Π (ω^k - (1 + i)) * Π (ω^k - (1 - i)), that includes k from 0 to 12.

Wait, but in our computation, we considered each product as Π (ω^k - a) = 1 - a^13. However, when k=0, ω^k =1, so (1 - a) is a term in each product. So, perhaps the product Π_{k=0}^{12} (ω^k - a) = 1 - a^13 is correct, including k=0. So, I think the computation is correct.

Therefore, the total product is 8321.

Wait, but 8321 seems like a four-digit number, and the problem asks for the remainder when divided by 1000. So, 8321 divided by 1000 is 8*1000=8000, remainder 321.

So, the remainder is 321.

Wait, but let me double-check my steps. Let me go back.

First, I expressed f(k) as (ω^k - (1 + i))(ω^k - (1 - i)), which seems correct.

Then, I split the product into two products: Π (ω^k - (1 + i)) and Π (ω^k - (1 - i)).

Then, I used the formula Π_{k=0}^{n-1} (ω^k - a) = 1 - a^n, which I think is correct because Π_{k=0}^{n-1} (x - ω^k) = x^n -1, so substituting x = a, Π_{k=0}^{n-1} (a - ω^k) = a^n -1, but since we have Π (ω^k - a) = (-1)^n Π (a - ω^k) = (-1)^n (a^n -1). For n=13, which is odd, this is - (a^13 -1) = 1 - a^13. That seems correct.

So, each product is 1 - a^13, which I computed for a = 1 + i and a = 1 - i.

Then, I computed (1 + i)^13 and (1 - i)^13 as -64 -64i and -64 +64i. Then, 1 - (1 + i)^13 is 65 +64i, and 1 - (1 - i)^13 is 65 -64i. Multiplying those gives 65^2 + 64^2 = 4225 + 4096 = 8321. That seems correct.

So, 8321 divided by 1000 is 8*1000=8000, so the remainder is 321. So, the answer is 321.

Wait, but just to make sure I didn't make any computational errors.

Compute (1 + i)^13:

1 + i is sqrt(2) e^{iπ/4}, so (1 + i)^13 = (sqrt(2))^13 e^{i13π/4}.

(sqrt(2))^13 = 2^(13/2) = 2^6 * 2^(1/2) = 64 * sqrt(2). Correct.

13π/4 is equivalent to 13π/4 - 2π * 1 = 13π/4 - 8π/4 = 5π/4.

So, e^{i5π/4} is indeed (-sqrt(2)/2 - i sqrt(2)/2). Correct.

So, (sqrt(2))^13 * e^{i5π/4} = 64 sqrt(2) * (-sqrt(2)/2 - i sqrt(2)/2) = 64*(-1 -i). Because sqrt(2)*sqrt(2)/2 = 2/2=1. Correct.

Similarly for (1 - i)^13, same process, gives 64*(-1 + i). Correct.

So, 1 - (1 + i)^13 is 1 - (-64 -64i) = 65 +64i. Correct.

Similarly, 1 - (-64 +64i) = 65 -64i. Correct.

Multiplying (65 +64i)(65 -64i) = 65² - (64i)^2 = 65² + 64². Wait, 64i squared is (64)^2*(-1), so subtracting it is adding (64)^2. Correct.

65^2 is 4225, 64^2 is 4096, sum is 8321. Correct.

8321 mod 1000 is 321. Correct.

I think my steps are correct. So, the remainder is 321.

To solve the problem, we start by recognizing that ω is a primitive 13th root of unity. The given product can be expressed as:

\[
\prod_{k=0}^{12}(2 - 2\omega^k + \omega^{2k})
\]

Each term in the product can be rewritten as a quadratic in \( \omega^k \):

\[
2 - 2\omega^k + \omega^{2k} = (\omega^k - (1 + i))(\omega^k - (1 - i))
\]

Thus, the entire product becomes:

\[
\prod_{k=0}^{12} (\omega^k - (1 + i)) \cdot \prod_{k=0}^{12} (\omega^k - (1 - i))
\]

Using the property of roots of unity, we know that:

\[
\prod_{k=0}^{12} (\omega^k - a) = 1 - a^{13}
\]

Applying this to each product, we get:

\[
[1 - (1 + i)^{13}] \cdot [1 - (1 - i)^{13}]
\]

Next, we compute \( (1 + i)^{13} \) and \( (1 - i)^{13} \). Expressing \( 1 + i \) and \( 1 - i \) in polar form:

\[
1 + i = \sqrt{2} e^{i\pi/4}, \quad 1 - i = \sqrt{2} e^{-i\pi/4}
\]

Raising these to the 13th power:

\[
(1 + i)^{13} = (\sqrt{2})^{13} e^{i \cdot 13\pi/4} = 64\sqrt{2} \cdot e^{i5\pi/4} = -64 - 64i
\]
\[
(1 - i)^{13} = (\sqrt{2})^{13} e^{-i \cdot 13\pi/4} = 64\sqrt{2} \cdot e^{-i5\pi/4} = -64 + 64i
\]

Substituting back, we have:

\[
[1 - (-64 - 64i)] \cdot [1 - (-64 + 64i)] = (65 + 64i)(65 - 64i)
\]

This simplifies to:

\[
65^2 + 64^2 = 4225 + 4096 = 8321
\]

Finally, taking the remainder when 8321 is divided by 1000:

\[
8321 \mod 1000 = 321
\]

Thus, the remainder is:

\boxed{321}
