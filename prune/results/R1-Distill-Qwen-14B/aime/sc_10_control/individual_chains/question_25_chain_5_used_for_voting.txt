Okay, so I've got this math problem here, and I need to figure out how many residents of Aimeville own all four things: a diamond ring, a set of golf clubs, a garden spade, and a bag of candy hearts. Hmm, let me try to break this down.

First, let's list out the numbers given. There are 900 residents in total. Out of these:

- 195 own a diamond ring.
- 367 own a set of golf clubs.
- 562 own a garden spade.
- And all 900 own a bag of candy hearts.

Wait, that's interesting. So everyone has at least one of these four items. But some have more. 

The problem also states that 437 residents own exactly two of these things, and 234 own exactly three. We're supposed to find how many own all four. 

Alright, so I remember that in set theory, when dealing with overlapping groups, the principle of inclusion-exclusion is used. But since the problem involves exactly two or exactly three items, I think I need to adjust the standard inclusion-exclusion formula.

Let me recall the formula for four sets. The total number of elements in the union of four sets A, B, C, D is:

|A ∪ B ∪ C ∪ D| = |A| + |B| + |C| + |D| - |A ∩ B| - |A ∩ C| - |A ∩ D| - |B ∩ C| - |B ∩ D| - |C ∩ D| + |A ∩ B ∩ C| + |A ∩ B ∩ D| + |A ∩ C ∩ D| + |B ∩ C ∩ D| - |A ∩ B ∩ C ∩ D|

But wait, in this case, the total number of residents is 900. So |A ∪ B ∪ C ∪ D| = 900 because everyone owns at least one item. So the formula simplifies to:

900 = |A| + |B| + |C| + |D| - (sum of all pairwise intersections) + (sum of all triple intersections) - |A ∩ B ∩ C ∩ D|

But I don't have the individual pairwise or triple intersections, but I have information about exactly two and exactly three items. So I need to relate these to the intersections.

Wait, let's think. The number of people owning exactly two items is 437, and exactly three is 234. The number owning all four is what we're looking for, let's call that x.

I remember that in inclusion-exclusion, the counts of intersections can be related to the counts of exactly two, exactly three, etc., by considering their overlaps.

For example, the number of people owning both A and B (the pairwise intersection |A ∩ B|) includes those who own exactly A and B, as well as those who own A, B, and maybe another item, or even all four. So to get the exact number of people owning exactly two items, we have to consider that each pair's intersection includes those who have exactly two, plus those who have three, four, etc.

Similarly, the triple intersections |A ∩ B ∩ C| include those who own exactly three items, as well as those who own all four.

So, the formula for the union is:

Total = sum of individual sets - sum of exactly two intersections + sum of exactly three intersections - exactly four.

Wait, no, perhaps I should model it differently. Let me consider the standard inclusion-exclusion but adjust for the exact counts.

The total number of elements is equal to:

(A + B + C + D) - (sum of all pairs) + (sum of all triples) - (all four).

But when we have the counts of exactly two, exactly three, and exactly four, perhaps we can express the formula in terms of these.

Wait, maybe it's better to model it as:

Total = exactly one + exactly two + exactly three + exactly four.

But in this problem, since everyone owns at least one, that's correct.

So, 900 = exactly one + 437 + 234 + x.

So, exactly one = 900 - (437 + 234 + x) = 900 - 671 - x = 229 - x.

Hmm, but I don't know the number of people who own exactly one item. So that might not help directly.

Alternatively, perhaps I can express the inclusion-exclusion formula in terms of the given data.

Let me denote:

- a = number of residents who own exactly 1 item.
- b = exactly 2 items = 437.
- c = exactly 3 items = 234.
- d = exactly 4 items = x.

So, a + b + c + d = 900.

We have b = 437, c = 234, so a + 437 + 234 + x = 900.

Thus, a = 900 - 437 - 234 - x = 229 - x.

Now, the other approach is to use the inclusion-exclusion formula, which relates the sizes of the sets and their intersections.

The inclusion-exclusion formula for four sets is:

|A ∪ B ∪ C ∪ D| = |A| + |B| + |C| + |D| - (|A∩B| + |A∩C| + |A∩D| + |B∩C| + |B∩D| + |C∩D|) + (|A∩B∩C| + |A∩B∩D| + |A∩C∩D| + |B∩C∩D|) - |A∩B∩C∩D|

But we know |A ∪ B ∪ C ∪ D| is 900, and each |A|, |B|, |C|, |D| are given.

So, let's plug in the numbers:

900 = (195 + 367 + 562 + 900) - (sum of all pairwise intersections) + (sum of all triple intersections) - x

Wait a second, because all 900 own at least one item, but the individual sets are:

- Diamond ring: 195
- Golf clubs: 367
- Garden spade: 562
- Candy hearts: 900 (since everyone has this)

Wait, hold on. The candy hearts are owned by everyone. So |D| = 900. That might make things a bit easier because any intersection involving D would be the same as the other set.

Wait, let's recast that.

So, |A| = 195 (diamond ring), |B| = 367 (golf clubs), |C| = 562 (garden spade), |D| = 900 (candy hearts).

So, |A| + |B| + |C| + |D| = 195 + 367 + 562 + 900.

Calculating that:

195 + 367 = 562; 562 + 562 = 1124; 1124 + 900 = 2024.

So, the sum is 2024.

Now, the inclusion-exclusion formula gives:

900 = 2024 - (sum of all pairwise intersections) + (sum of all triple intersections) - x

So, rearranged:

sum of all pairwise intersections = 2024 - 900 + (sum of all triple intersections) - x

Which is:

sum of all pairwise intersections = 1124 + (sum of all triple intersections) - x

Hmm, but I don't know the sum of all triple intersections. Let me think about the triple intersections.

Each triple intersection, like |A ∩ B ∩ C|, includes:

- Those who own exactly three items (c = 234), but if D is involved, since D is owned by everyone, any triple that includes D would have a higher count.

Wait, perhaps it's better to express the sum of the triple intersections in terms of the exactly three and exactly four.

Each triple intersection is the sum of those who own exactly three of those three items plus those who own all four.

So, for example, |A ∩ B ∩ C| = number of people owning exactly A, B, C + x (those owning all four). Similarly, |A ∩ B ∩ D| = exactly A, B, D + x, but since D is everything, |A ∩ B ∩ D| = |A ∩ B|, because everyone owns D. Wait, no. Wait, no, because D is the set of all 900, so any intersection with D is just the other set.

Wait, wait. Let me clarify.

Since D is the set of all 900 residents, any intersection of D with another set is just that other set. So, |A ∩ D| = |A|, because everyone in A also owns D. Similarly, |A ∩ B ∩ D| = |A ∩ B|, since D includes everyone.

Wait, so that changes things. Let me think.

So, in the inclusion-exclusion formula, the sum of all triple intersections includes terms like |A ∩ B ∩ C|, |A ∩ B ∩ D|, |A ∩ C ∩ D|, |B ∩ C ∩ D|.

But since D is the entire set, these become:

|A ∩ B ∩ C|, |A ∩ B|, |A ∩ C|, |B ∩ C|.

Because, for example, |A ∩ B ∩ D| = |A ∩ B|, since D includes everyone.

So, the sum of all triple intersections is:

|A ∩ B ∩ C| + |A ∩ B| + |A ∩ C| + |B ∩ C|.

Similarly, the sum of all pairwise intersections includes |A ∩ B|, |A ∩ C|, |A ∩ D|, |B ∩ C|, |B ∩ D|, |C ∩ D|.

But again, since D is everyone, |A ∩ D| = |A|, |B ∩ D| = |B|, |C ∩ D| = |C|.

So, the sum of pairwise intersections is:

|A ∩ B| + |A ∩ C| + |A| + |B ∩ C| + |B| + |C|.

Wait, no. Wait, the pairwise intersections are all the possible pairs. There are six pairs for four sets: AB, AC, AD, BC, BD, CD.

But since AD is |A|, BD is |B|, CD is |C|.

So, sum of pairwise intersections = |A ∩ B| + |A ∩ C| + |A| + |B ∩ C| + |B| + |C|.

Wait, that's 6 terms, where three of them are the individual set sizes because of the intersections with D.

Hmm, but in the inclusion-exclusion formula, the sum is subtracted. So, let's try to write this.

The inclusion-exclusion formula is:

900 = (195 + 367 + 562 + 900) - [ |A ∩ B| + |A ∩ C| + |A| + |B ∩ C| + |B| + |C| ] + [ |A ∩ B ∩ C| + |A ∩ B| + |A ∩ C| + |B ∩ C| ] - x.

Wait, this is getting complicated. Maybe I should step back.

Alternatively, perhaps I can express the pairwise and triple intersections in terms of the exactly two and exactly three, plus x.

Because the pairwise intersections include exactly two, exactly three, and exactly four.

Similarly, the triple intersections include exactly three and exactly four.

So, let me think: the sum of all pairwise intersections is equal to the sum over all pairs of (number of people owning exactly those two plus those owning exactly those three, plus those owning all four).

But wait, for each pair, like A and B, the intersection |A ∩ B| includes:

- Those who own exactly A and B.
- Those who own exactly A, B, and C.
- Those who own exactly A, B, and D.
- Those who own all four.

Wait, but since D is everything, A ∩ B ∩ D is just A ∩ B, which is the same as |A ∩ B|. Hmm, perhaps this approach isn't the best.

Alternatively, I know that:

Each person who owns exactly two items is counted once in exactly one pairwise intersection.

Each person who owns exactly three items is counted in three pairwise intersections.

Each person who owns exactly four items is counted in six pairwise intersections (since each pair is formed by the four, so 4 choose 2 = 6).

Similarly, each person who owns exactly three items is counted in three triple intersections, and those with exactly four are counted in four triple intersections.

Wait, that might be more systematic.

So, let me denote:

Let E2 be the number of residents owning exactly two items: E2 = 437.

E3 = exactly three items: 234.

E4 = exactly four items: x.

So, the total number of people is E1 + E2 + E3 + E4 = 900.

Now, the sum of all pairwise intersections (each pair) is equal to the number of people owning exactly two items (since each E2 contributes to one pair) plus 3*E3 (each E3 contributes to three pairs) plus 6*E4 (each E4 contributes to six pairs).

So, sum of pairwise intersections = E2 + 3*E3 + 6*E4.

Similarly, the sum of all triple intersections would be equal to E3 + 3*E4 (each E3 contributes to three triples, and each E4 contributes to four triples? Wait, no. Wait, each triple is a combination of three items. So, a person with exactly four items would be in all possible triples, which is four triples (since four items, so 4 choose 3 = 4 triples). So, each E4 is counted in four triple intersections.

So, sum of triple intersections = E3 + 4*E4.

So, putting this together:

sum_pair = E2 + 3*E3 + 6*E4.

sum_triple = E3 + 4*E4.

Now, let's plug these into the inclusion-exclusion formula.

We have:

900 = (|A| + |B| + |C| + |D|) - sum_pair + sum_triple - E4.

But |A|, |B|, |C|, and |D| are 195, 367, 562, and 900, respectively.

So, |A| + |B| + |C| + |D| = 195 + 367 + 562 + 900 = let's compute that.

195 + 367 = 562; 562 + 562 = 1124; 1124 + 900 = 2024.

So, 900 = 2024 - (E2 + 3*E3 + 6*E4) + (E3 + 4*E4) - E4.

Let me simplify the right side.

First, let me expand the equation:

900 = 2024 - E2 - 3*E3 - 6*E4 + E3 + 4*E4 - E4.

Combine like terms:

- E2: -437

- E3: -3*234 + 234 = (-3 +1)*234 = -2*234.

Wait, no, better to compute coefficients step by step.

The terms are:

- E2: -E2

- E3: (-3*E3) + (1*E3) = (-2*E3)

- E4: (-6*E4) + (4*E4) + (-1*E4) = (-6 +4 -1)*E4 = (-3*E4)

So, overall:

900 = 2024 - E2 - 2*E3 - 3*E4.

Now, plug in E2 = 437 and E3 = 234:

900 = 2024 - 437 - 2*234 - 3x.

Compute each term:

2024 - 437 = 1587.

2*234 = 468.

So,

900 = 1587 - 468 - 3x.

Compute 1587 - 468:

1587 - 400 = 1187; 1187 - 68 = 1119.

So,

900 = 1119 - 3x.

Rearrange:

3x = 1119 - 900.

3x = 219.

Thus,

x = 219 / 3 = 73.

So, the number of residents who own all four items is 73.

To determine the number of residents in Aimeville who own all four items (diamond ring, golf clubs, garden spade, and candy hearts), we use the principle of inclusion-exclusion and the given data.

We denote:
- \( E_2 = 437 \) as the number of residents owning exactly two items.
- \( E_3 = 234 \) as the number owning exactly three items.
- \( E_4 = x \) as the number owning all four items.
- The total number of residents is 900.

Using the inclusion-exclusion principle:

\[
900 = |A| + |B| + |C| + |D| - \text{(sum of pairwise intersections)} + \text{(sum of triple intersections)} - E_4
\]

Where:
- \( |A| = 195 \), \( |B| = 367 \), \( |C| = 562 \), \( |D| = 900 \).
- The sum of pairwise intersections includes those owning exactly two items (\( E_2 \)), those owning exactly three items (\( 3E_3 \)), and those owning all four items (\( 6E_4 \)).
- The sum of triple intersections includes those owning exactly three items (\( E_3 \)) and those owning all four items (\( 4E_4 \)).

Substituting these into the equation:

\[
900 = 2024 - (E_2 + 3E_3 + 6E_4) + (E_3 + 4E_4) - E_4
\]

Simplifying:

\[
900 = 2024 - E_2 - 2E_3 - 3E_4
\]

Plugging in \( E_2 = 437 \) and \( E_3 = 234 \):

\[
900 = 2024 - 437 - 468 - 3x
\]

\[
900 = 1119 - 3x
\]

\[
3x = 219
\]

\[
x = 73
\]

Thus, the number of residents who own all four items is \(\boxed{73}\).
