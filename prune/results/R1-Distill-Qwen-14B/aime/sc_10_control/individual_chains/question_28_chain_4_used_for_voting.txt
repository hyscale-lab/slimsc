Okay, so I've got this problem about a tetrahedron ABCD with specific edge lengths, and I need to find the distance from the incenter (the point equidistant from all faces) to each face. The distance is supposed to be in the form m√n / p, and I need to find m + n + p. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.

First, let me recall what a tetrahedron is. It's a 3D shape with four triangular faces, four vertices, and six edges. In this case, the edges are given with specific lengths: AB and CD are √41, AC and BD are √80, and BC and AD are √89. So, each pair of opposite edges are equal. Interesting, so this seems like a symmetrical tetrahedron. Maybe it has some properties that can help me.

I remember that in a tetrahedron, the inradius (the radius of the inscribed sphere that touches all faces) can be found using the formula:

r = 3V / S

where V is the volume of the tetrahedron and S is the total surface area. So, I need to find both the volume and the surface area of this tetrahedron.

Wait, but to find V, I might need the coordinates of the vertices or some other way to compute it. Since the edge lengths are given, maybe I can use Heron's formula to find the areas of the faces and then use those to find the volume? Hmm, but I'm not sure if that's straightforward.

Alternatively, since all opposite edges are equal, maybe this tetrahedron is "equifacial" or something similar. Wait, no, equifacial tetrahedrons have all faces congruent, which isn't necessarily the case here. Let me check the face areas.

Wait, each pair of opposite edges is equal, so for instance, AB = CD, AC = BD, and BC = AD. So, maybe each pair of opposite faces are congruent? That could help.

Let me try to compute the surface area first. Each face is a triangle, so I can compute the area of each using Heron's formula and then add them up.

But wait, how many unique faces are there? Since opposite edges are equal, maybe opposite faces have equal areas. Let me see:

Face ABC: edges AB, BC, AC.
Face ABD: edges AB, BD, AD.
Face ACD: edges AC, CD, AD.
Face BCD: edges BD, CD, BC.

Given the edge lengths:

AB = CD = √41
AC = BD = √80
BC = AD = √89

So, let's compute the area of face ABC.

First, for triangle ABC, the sides are AB = √41, BC = √89, and AC = √80.

Compute the semi-perimeter (s):

s = (√41 + √89 + √80) / 2

Hmm, this looks a bit messy. Maybe I can use Heron's formula, but the square roots might complicate things. Alternatively, perhaps there's a better way.

Wait, maybe the tetrahedron is such that all its faces are congruent? But that would make it a regular tetrahedron, but with edge lengths √41, √80, √89, which are different. So, no, the faces aren't congruent.

Alternatively, perhaps the tetrahedron is "isohedral," but I think that also refers to congruent faces. Hmm.

Wait, maybe I can find the volume using another approach. There's a formula for the volume of a tetrahedron when all the edges are known, called the Cayley-Menger determinant. I think that's a possibility.

The Cayley-Menger determinant for a tetrahedron with edge lengths AB = a, AC = b, AD = c, BC = d, BD = e, CD = f is given by:

Volume = sqrt( |CM| / 288 ), where CM is the determinant of the following matrix:

| 0   1    1    1    1  |
| 1   0   a²   b²   c² |
| 1  a²   0    d²   e² |
| 1  b²  d²    0    f² |
| 1  c²  e²   f²    0  |

So, let me plug in the given edge lengths.

Given:
AB = √41 ⇒ a² = 41
AC = √80 ⇒ b² = 80
AD = √89 ⇒ c² = 89
BC = √89 ⇒ d² = 89
BD = √80 ⇒ e² = 80
CD = √41 ⇒ f² = 41

So, the Cayley-Menger matrix is:

Row 0: 0, 1, 1, 1, 1

Row 1: 1, 0, 41, 80, 89

Row 2: 1, 41, 0, 89, 80

Row 3: 1, 80, 89, 0, 41

Row 4: 1, 89, 80, 41, 0

Wait, let me confirm the positions. The first row is [0,1,1,1,1]. Then each subsequent row corresponds to the squares of the edges.

But wait, the order is AB², AC², AD², BC², BD², CD². So, the positions in the matrix should be:

- The first element is 0, then the next four are 1,1,1,1.

- The second row is 1, 0, AB², AC², AD² → 1, 0, 41, 80, 89.

- The third row is 1, AB², 0, BC², BD² → 1,41,0,89,80.

- The fourth row is 1, AC², BC², 0, CD² → 1,80,89,0,41.

- The fifth row is 1, AD², BD², CD², 0 → 1,89,80,41,0.

Yes, that looks correct.

So, the matrix is:

Row 0: 0, 1, 1, 1, 1

Row 1: 1, 0, 41, 80, 89

Row 2: 1, 41, 0, 89, 80

Row 3: 1, 80, 89, 0, 41

Row 4: 1, 89, 80, 41, 0

Now, I need to compute the determinant of this 5x5 matrix. But computing a 5x5 determinant by hand is quite tedious. Maybe I can find a pattern or some symmetry to simplify it.

Looking at the matrix, I notice that it's symmetric across the diagonal. Maybe this can help in computing the determinant.

Alternatively, perhaps there's a way to compute the determinant using properties of the matrix or by recognizing it's a special kind of matrix.

Wait, the Cayley-Menger determinant for a tetrahedron is always such that the determinant is proportional to the square of the volume. Since I need the volume, let's try to compute this determinant.

But since it's a 5x5, let me try expanding it step by step.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use a known formula or property for this specific matrix.

Alternatively, perhaps I can substitute the determinant formula. From what I remember, the formula for the Cayley-Menger determinant for four points in 3D space is:

CM = determinant of the above matrix.

And the volume is sqrt(|CM| / 288).

So, let's compute CM.

Let me denote the matrix as M. So,

M = [
[0, 1, 1, 1, 1],
[1, 0, 41, 80, 89],
[1, 41, 0, 89, 80],
[1, 80, 89, 0, 41],
[1, 89, 80, 41, 0]
]

Computing the determinant of this matrix... Hmm, maybe it's better to use expansion by minors. Let's try.

But wait, the determinant of a 5x5 matrix is going to be a lot of work. Maybe I can perform row or column operations to simplify it.

Looking at the first column, all the entries are 1 except the first one, which is 0. Maybe I can subtract the first row from the other rows to create zeros in the first column.

Let me do that:

Subtract Row 0 from Rows 1-4:

Row 0 remains: [0, 1, 1, 1, 1]

Row 1: [1-0, 0-1, 41-1, 80-1, 89-1] → [1, -1, 40, 79, 88]

Wait, no, that's not correct. Wait, when subtracting Row 0 from each row, I think it's each element of the row minus the corresponding element of Row 0.

Wait, but Row 0 is [0,1,1,1,1]. So, Row 1 is [1,0,41,80,89]. So, Row 1 - Row 0 would be [1-0, 0-1, 41-1, 80-1, 89-1] → [1, -1, 40, 79, 88].

Similarly for the other rows:

Row 2 - Row 0: [1-0, 41-1, 0-1, 89-1, 80-1] → [1,40,-1,88,79]

Row 3 - Row 0: [1-0,80-1,89-1,0-1,41-1] → [1,79,88,-1,40]

Row 4 - Row 0: [1-0,89-1,80-1,41-1,0-1] → [1,88,79,40,-1]

So, the new matrix after these operations is:

Row 0: [0, 1, 1, 1, 1]

Row 1: [1, -1, 40, 79, 88]

Row 2: [1, 40, -1, 88, 79]

Row 3: [1, 79, 88, -1, 40]

Row 4: [1, 88, 79, 40, -1]

Now, the determinant remains the same because we're subtracting rows. Wait, no, actually, when we perform row operations, adding a multiple of one row to another doesn't change the determinant. But subtracting a row from another row? Wait, no, wait, I subtracted Row 0 from each of the other rows.

Wait, actually, each of the rows 1-4 has had Row 0 subtracted. So, the new matrix is:

Row 0: [0, 1, 1, 1, 1]

Row 1: [1, -1, 40, 79, 88]

Row 2: [1, 40, -1, 88, 79]

Row 3: [1, 79, 88, -1, 40]

Row 4: [1, 88, 79, 40, -1]

But the determinant is unchanged except for the sign when rows are swapped, but we're only doing row operations that don't change the determinant. Hmm, but I'm not sure if this helps. Maybe this isn't the best approach.

Alternatively, perhaps I can compute the determinant by expanding along the first column since it has a 0 which might make things easier.

The determinant can be expanded along the first column. The first column has entries: 0,1,1,1,1.

So, the determinant is:

0 * minor - 1 * minor + 1 * minor - 1 * minor + 1 * minor

But since the first element is 0, that term drops out. So, determinant = (-1)^{1+1} * 1 * M11 + (-1)^{2+1} * 1 * M21 + (-1)^{3+1} * 1 * M31 + (-1)^{4+1} * 1 * M41 + (-1)^{5+1} * 1 * M51

Wait, actually, the general formula for the determinant expansion along the first column is:

sum_{i=1 to 5} [ (-1)^{i+1} * M[0][i] * det(minor(i,0)) ]

Wait, no, in zero-based indexing, it's sum_{i=0 to 4} [ (-1)^{i+1} * M[i][0] * det(minor(i,0)) ]

Wait, perhaps I should index it from 1. Alternatively, maybe it's better to consider 1-based indexing for this.

Wait, this is getting a bit confusing. Let me think again.

In 1-based indexing, the determinant expansion along the first column (column 1) is:

sum_{i=1 to 5} ( (-1)^{i+1} * M[i][1] * det(minor(i,1)) )

But in our matrix, the first column is [0,1,1,1,1], so the expansion becomes:

0 * det(minor(1,1)) - 1 * det(minor(2,1)) + 1 * det(minor(3,1)) - 1 * det(minor(4,1)) + 1 * det(minor(5,1))

So, the determinant is:

0 - det(minor(2,1)) + det(minor(3,1)) - det(minor(4,1)) + det(minor(5,1))

So, I need to compute four 4x4 determinants.

This is manageable but will take some time.

Let me denote each minor:

Minor(2,1) is the 4x4 matrix obtained by removing row 2 and column 1.

Similarly for others.

So, let's find each minor.

First, Minor(2,1):

Remove row 2 and column 1.

Original matrix:

Row 0: 0, 1, 1, 1, 1

Row 1:1, 0,41,80,89

Row 2:1,41,0,89,80

Row 3:1,80,89,0,41

Row 4:1,89,80,41,0

After removing row 2 and column 1, the minor is:

Row 0: [0, 1, 1, 1]

Row 1: [1,41,80,89]

Row 3: [1,89,0,41]

Row 4: [1,80,41,0]

So, the minor matrix is:

[
[0, 1, 1, 1],
[1,41,80,89],
[1,89,0,41],
[1,80,41,0]
]

Wait, no, wait. Wait: when you remove row 2 and column 1, the remaining rows are 0,1,3,4 and columns 0,2,3,4.

So, the minor(2,1) is:

Row 0: [0, 1, 1, 1]

Row 1: [1,41,80,89]

Row 3: [1,89,0,41]

Row 4: [1,80,41,0]

So, the minor matrix is:

Row 0: 0,1,1,1

Row 1:1,41,80,89

Row 2:1,89,0,41

Row 3:1,80,41,0

Wait, but in 4x4, indices are 0 to 3.

So, the minor matrix is:

[
[0, 1, 1, 1],
[1,41,80,89],
[1,89,0,41],
[1,80,41,0]
]

Hmm, computing this determinant. Let's denote this as D1.

Computing D1.

Again, maybe expand along the first column which has a 0.

So, expansion along column 0:

0 * minor - 1 * minor + 1 * minor - 1 * minor

Again, the first term is zero.

So, D1 = (-1)^{1+1} * 1 * det(minor(1,0)) + (-1)^{2+1} * 1 * det(minor(2,0)) + (-1)^{3+1} * 1 * det(minor(3,0))

So, D1 = det(minor(1,0)) - det(minor(2,0)) + det(minor(3,0))

Compute each minor:

Minor(1,0) is the 3x3 matrix obtained by removing row 1 and column 0:

[
[1,1,1],
[89,0,41],
[80,41,0]
]

Compute det of this:

= 1*(0*0 - 41*41) -1*(89*0 - 41*80) + 1*(89*41 - 0*80)
= 1*(0 - 1681) -1*(0 - 3280) + 1*(3649 - 0)
= (-1681) - (-3280) + 3649
= (-1681) + 3280 + 3649
= (3280 - 1681) + 3649
= 1599 + 3649
= 5248

Wait, let me check that calculation again.

Wait, the determinant is:

1*(0*0 - 41*41) = 1*(-1681) = -1681

-1*(89*0 - 41*80) = -1*(0 - 3280) = -1*(-3280) = +3280

+1*(89*41 - 0*80) = 1*(3649 - 0) = +3649

So, total: -1681 + 3280 + 3649.

Compute step by step:

-1681 + 3280 = 1599

1599 + 3649 = 5248

Yes, so det(minor(1,0)) = 5248.

Next, minor(2,0):

Remove row 2 and column 0 from the minor matrix. So, the minor is:

[
[0,1,1,1],
[1,41,80,89],
[1,80,41,0]
]

Wait, wait no. The minor(2,0) is the 3x3 matrix obtained by removing row 2 and column 0.

Wait, in the D1 minor matrix, which is 4x4, the minor(2,0) is row 2, column 0. So, removing row 2 and column 0, the minor is:

[
[0,1,1,1],
[1,41,80,89],
[1,80,41,0]
]

Wait, but that's 3x4. Wait, no, I think I have to adjust.

Wait, in the 4x4 minor matrix, the minor for position (2,0) is the 3x3 matrix obtained by removing row 2 and column 0.

So, the minor matrix is:

Row 0: 0,1,1,1

Row 1:1,41,80,89

Row 2:1,89,0,41

Row 3:1,80,41,0

So, removing row 2 and column 0, the minor is:

Row 0: [0,1,1,1] → becomes [1,1,1]

Row 1: [1,41,80,89] → becomes [41,80,89]

Row 3: [1,80,41,0] → becomes [80,41,0]

So, the minor matrix is:

[
[1,1,1],
[41,80,89],
[80,41,0]
]

Compute det of this:

= 1*(80*0 - 89*41) -1*(41*0 - 89*80) + 1*(41*41 - 80*80)
= 1*(0 - 3649) -1*(0 - 7120) +1*(1681 - 6400)
= (-3649) - (-7120) + ( -4719 )
= (-3649) + 7120 -4719

Compute step by step:

-3649 + 7120 = 3471

3471 -4719 = -1248

So, det(minor(2,0)) = -1248.

Next, minor(3,0):

In the D1 minor matrix, removing row 3 and column 0, so:

Row 0: [0,1,1,1] → becomes [0,1,1,1] (but removing column 0 → [1,1,1])

Row 1: [1,41,80,89] → becomes [41,80,89]

Row 2: [1,89,0,41] → becomes [89,0,41]

So, minor(3,0) is:

[
[1,1,1],
[41,80,89],
[89,0,41]
]

Compute determinant:

= 1*(80*41 - 89*0) -1*(41*41 - 89*89) +1*(41*0 - 80*89)
= 1*(3280 - 0) -1*(1681 - 7921) +1*(0 - 7040)
= 3280 - (-6240) + (-7040)
= 3280 + 6240 -7040
= (3280 +6240) = 9520 -7040 = 2480

So, det(minor(3,0)) = 2480.

So, putting it all together, D1 = 5248 - (-1248) + 2480.

Wait, no:

D1 = det(minor(1,0)) - det(minor(2,0)) + det(minor(3,0))

So, D1 = 5248 - (-1248) + 2480.

Wait, no, the signs are:

D1 = (+5248) - (-1248) + (+2480)

So, 5248 + 1248 +2480.

Compute:

5248 + 1248 = 6496

6496 +2480 = 8976

So, D1 = 8976.

Wait, but determinant can't be positive? Or is it? Wait, no, the determinant can be positive or negative. Anyway, moving on.

Next, Minor(3,1):

Wait, no, wait. Wait, in the original expansion, determinant is -D1 + D3 - D4 + D5, where D1, D3, D4, D5 are the determinants of minors(2,1), minors(3,1), etc.

Wait, no, let's go back. The determinant expansion was:

CM = 0 - det(Minor(2,1)) + det(Minor(3,1)) - det(Minor(4,1)) + det(Minor(5,1))

So, I just computed Minor(2,1) determinant as D1=8976.

Now, I need to compute Minor(3,1), which is the determinant when removing row 3 and column1.

Original matrix:

Row0:0,1,1,1,1

Row1:1,0,41,80,89

Row2:1,41,0,89,80

Row3:1,80,89,0,41

Row4:1,89,80,41,0

Minor(3,1): remove row3 and column1.

So, remaining rows: 0,1,2,4.

Remaining columns:0,2,3,4.

So, the minor matrix is:

Row0:0,1,1,1

Row1:1,41,80,89

Row2:1,0,89,80

Row4:1,80,41,0

So, minor(3,1) matrix:

[
[0,1,1,1],
[1,41,80,89],
[1,0,89,80],
[1,80,41,0]
]

Let's compute its determinant, D2.

Again, expand along the first column since it has a 0.

So, expansion along column 0:

0 * minor - 1 * minor + 1 * minor - 1 * minor

So, D2 = 0 - det(minor(1,0)) + det(minor(2,0)) - det(minor(3,0))

So, D2 = -det(minor(1,0)) + det(minor(2,0)) - det(minor(3,0)).

Compute each minor:

Minor(1,0): remove row1 and column0 from the minor matrix.

The minor matrix is:

Row0:0,1,1,1

Row1:1,41,80,89

Row2:1,0,89,80

Row3:1,80,41,0

Removing row1 and column0:

Row0: [0,1,1,1] → [1,1,1]

Row2: [1,0,89,80] → [0,89,80]

Row3: [1,80,41,0] → [80,41,0]

So, minor(1,0) is:

[
[1,1,1],
[0,89,80],
[80,41,0]
]

Compute det:

= 1*(89*0 -80*41) -1*(0*0 -80*80) +1*(0*41 -89*80)
= 1*(0 -3280) -1*(0 -6400) +1*(0 -7120)
= (-3280) - (-6400) + (-7120)
= (-3280) +6400 -7120
= (6400 -3280) = 3120 -7120 = -4000

So, det(minor(1,0)) = -4000.

Minor(2,0): remove row2 and column0.

The minor matrix:

Row0:0,1,1,1

Row1:1,41,80,89

Row2:1,0,89,80

Row3:1,80,41,0

Removing row2 and column0:

Row0: [0,1,1,1] → [1,1,1]

Row1: [1,41,80,89] → [41,80,89]

Row3: [1,80,41,0] → [80,41,0]

So, minor(2,0) is:

[
[1,1,1],
[41,80,89],
[80,41,0]
]

Compute det:

= 1*(80*0 -89*41) -1*(41*0 -89*80) +1*(41*41 -80*80)
= 1*(0 -3649) -1*(0 -7120) +1*(1681 -6400)
= (-3649) - (-7120) + (-4719)
= (-3649) +7120 -4719
= (7120 -3649)=3471 -4719= -1248

So, det(minor(2,0)) = -1248.

Minor(3,0): remove row3 and column0.

The minor matrix:

Row0:0,1,1,1

Row1:1,41,80,89

Row2:1,0,89,80

Row3:1,80,41,0

Removing row3 and column0:

Row0: [0,1,1,1] → [1,1,1]

Row1: [1,41,80,89] → [41,80,89]

Row2: [1,0,89,80] → [0,89,80]

So, minor(3,0) is:

[
[1,1,1],
[41,80,89],
[0,89,80]
]

Compute det:

= 1*(80*80 -89*89) -1*(41*80 -89*0) +1*(41*89 -80*0)
= 1*(6400 -7921) -1*(3280 - 0) +1*(3649 -0)
= ( -1521 ) -3280 +3649
= (-1521 -3280) +3649
= (-4801) +3649
= -1152

So, det(minor(3,0)) = -1152.

Putting it all together, D2 = -(-4000) + (-1248) - (-1152)

Wait, no:

D2 = -det(minor(1,0)) + det(minor(2,0)) - det(minor(3,0))

So,

= -(-4000) + (-1248) - (-1152)
= 4000 -1248 +1152
= 4000 + ( -1248 +1152 ) = 4000 -96 = 3904

So, D2 = 3904.

Wait, let me compute it again:

= -(-4000) = +4000

+ det(minor(2,0)) = -1248

- det(minor(3,0)) = - (-1152) = +1152

So, 4000 -1248 +1152.

Compute 4000 -1248 = 2752

2752 +1152 = 3904

Yes, correct.

So, D2 = 3904.

Now, moving on to Minor(4,1):

Remove row4 and column1.

Original matrix:

Row0:0,1,1,1,1

Row1:1,0,41,80,89

Row2:1,41,0,89,80

Row3:1,80,89,0,41

Row4:1,89,80,41,0

After removing row4 and column1, the minor matrix is:

Row0:0,1,1,1

Row1:1,41,80,89

Row2:1,0,89,80

Row3:1,80,41,0

Wait, that's the same as Minor(3,1), which we computed as D2=3904.

Wait, is that correct?

Wait, no, wait. When you remove row4 and column1, the remaining rows are 0,1,2,3.

So,

Row0: [0,1,1,1]

Row1: [1,0,41,80,89] → remove column1 → [1,41,80,89]

Row2: [1,41,0,89,80] → remove column1 → [1,0,89,80]

Row3: [1,80,89,0,41] → remove column1 → [1,89,0,41]

Wait, so the minor matrix is:

[
[0,1,1,1],
[1,41,80,89],
[1,0,89,80],
[1,89,0,41]
]

Wait, this is the same as Minor(3,1), which was D2=3904.

So, Minor(4,1) determinant is also 3904.

Wait, but hold on, the position is Minor(4,1). So, the sign in the expansion will be different.

Wait, the original expansion for the determinant was:

CM = 0 - D1 + D2 - D3 + D4

Wait, in the initial expansion, the signs alternate starting with positive for the first term. So, for the determinant, the expansion is:

CM = 0 - D1 + D2 - D3 + D4

Wait, but in our case, the four terms after 0 are:

- det(Minor(2,1)) + det(Minor(3,1)) - det(Minor(4,1)) + det(Minor(5,1))

But in the original matrix, the minors are 2,1; 3,1; 4,1;5,1.

But wait, the initial matrix is 5x5, so minor(5,1) would be the determinant after removing row5 and column1.

But in our case, the rows are 0-4, so row5 doesn't exist. So, perhaps it's row4.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let's clarify.

Wait, in the 5x5 matrix, the first column is column0, and the rows are 0-4.

Wait, no, in the initial expansion, I think I messed up the indices.

Wait, perhaps it's better to take a step back.

Given the complexity, maybe computing the Cayley-Menger determinant directly isn't the best approach for me right now. Maybe I can find another way to compute the volume.

Wait, another idea: since all opposite edges are equal, maybe the tetrahedron is "equidistant" in some way, and perhaps it's a disphenoid. A disphenoid is a tetrahedron where opposite edges are equal, and it's known that in a disphenoid, the volume can be calculated using a formula involving the edge lengths.

I think the formula for the volume of a disphenoid is:

V = (sqrt( (a² + b² - c²)(a² + b² + c²) )) / 8

Wait, no, that doesn't seem right. Let me think.

Wait, perhaps the formula is V = (sqrt( (a² + b² - c²)(a² - b² + c²)(-a² + b² + c²) )) / something.

Wait, no, that's the formula for a regular tetrahedron.

Wait, maybe I should look up the formula for the volume of a disphenoid.

Wait, I recall that in a disphenoid, the volume can be calculated using the formula:

V = (sqrt( (a² + b² - c²)(a² - b² + c²)(-a² + b² + c²) )) / (8)

Wait, no, that seems similar to Heron's formula but for 3D. Wait, but Heron's formula is for 2D.

Alternatively, maybe not. Alternatively, perhaps I can use the formula for the volume of a tetrahedron in terms of edge lengths for a disphenoid.

Wait, since all opposite edges are equal, the volume might have a simpler expression.

I found somewhere that in a disphenoid, the volume is given by:

V = sqrt( (a² + b² - c²)(a² - b² + c²)(-a² + b² + c²) ) / 8

Wait, but I'm not sure if that's correct. Alternatively, maybe it's half of that.

Wait, let me test with a regular tetrahedron where a = b = c. Then, each term inside the sqrt becomes (a² + a² - a²) = a², so overall sqrt(a^6) = a^3, and then V = a^3 /8. But in reality, the volume of a regular tetrahedron is V = a³/(6√2), which is different. So, that formula can't be correct.

Hmm, maybe that formula isn't applicable here. Let me think differently.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use the formula for the volume of a tetrahedron as V = (1/3)*base_area*height.

But I don't know the height yet.

Alternatively, perhaps I can find the volume by dividing the tetrahedron into two parts or using coordinates.

Wait, another approach: assign coordinates to the vertices such that the tetrahedron is centered at the origin or something, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe I can use the formula for the volume of a tetrahedron in terms of edge lengths and the inradius.

Wait, the inradius formula is r = 3V / S, where S is the total surface area.

So, if I can find S, and somehow find V, then I can find r. But I still need V.

Wait, perhaps I can compute the volume using vectors. If I can assign coordinates to the points, I can compute the volume using the scalar triple product.

Let me try that.

Let me place vertex A at the origin, (0,0,0).

Let me place vertex B along the x-axis: B = (x, 0, 0). The distance AB is sqrt(41), so AB² = x² = 41 → x = sqrt(41). So, B = (sqrt(41), 0, 0).

Now, let me place vertex C in the xy-plane. Let’s denote C = (a, b, 0). The distances AC and BC are sqrt(80) and sqrt(89), respectively.

So, distance AC² = a² + b² = 80.

Distance BC² = (a - sqrt(41))² + b² = 89.

So, subtracting the two equations:

(a - sqrt(41))² + b² - (a² + b²) = 89 -80 → (a² - 2a sqrt(41) +41) -a² =9 → -2a sqrt(41) +41=9 → -2a sqrt(41)= -32 → a = (32)/(2 sqrt(41)) = 16 / sqrt(41)

Rationalizing, a = (16 sqrt(41)) /41.

So, a = (16√41)/41.

Then, from AC² = a² + b² =80:

So, b²=80 -a².

Compute a²:

a² = (256 *41)/(41²) = (256 *41)/ (1681) = (256/41) *41/(41) ?

Wait, no, 16√41 /41 squared is (256 *41)/(41²) = 256 /41.

So, a² = 256 /41.

So, b² = 80 - 256/41 = (80*41 -256)/41 = (3280 -256)/41 = 3024 /41.

So, b = sqrt(3024 /41) = sqrt(3024)/sqrt(41).

Compute sqrt(3024):

3024 factors: 3024 = 16 * 189 = 16 * 9 *21 = 16*9*3*7.

So, sqrt(3024) = 4*3*sqrt(21) =12√21.

So, b=12√21 / sqrt(41) = (12√21√41)/41 = (12√861)/41.

Wait, but 861 factors: 861 = 3*287 =3*7*41. So, 861=3*7*41, which is square-free. So, b=12√(3*7*41)/41 =12√861 /41.

So, the coordinates of point C are:

C = (16√41 /41, 12√861 /41, 0 )

Wait, but let me check if this is correct.

Wait, let me verify the distance BC:

Compute distance between B (sqrt41,0,0) and C (16√41/41,12√861/41,0):

Difference in x: (16√41)/41 - sqrt41 = (16√41 -41√41)/41 = (-25√41)/41.

Difference in y: 12√861 /41 -0=12√861 /41.

So, distance squared is:

( (-25√41)/41 )² + (12√861 /41 )²

= (625 *41)/(41²) + (144*861)/(41²)

= (625*41 +144*861)/41²

Compute numerator:

625*41 = 25625

144*861: 144*800=115200; 144*61=8784 → total 115200 +8784=123,984.

So, numerator=25625 +123,984=149,609.

Denominator=41²=1681.

So, distance squared=149609 /1681.

Compute 149609 ÷1681.

1681*89=1681*(90-1)=1681*90=151,290 minus 1681=151,290-1,681=149,609.

So, 149609 /1681=89.

So, distance BC squared is 89, which matches. Good.

So, point C is correctly placed.

Now, let's place point D somewhere in 3D space. Let D = (p, q, r). We need to satisfy the distances:

AD = sqrt89, so distance from A(0,0,0) to D(p,q,r) is sqrt89:

p² + q² + r² =89.

Distance CD = sqrt41:

C is (16√41/41, 12√861/41, 0), D is (p,q,r).

So, distance squared:

(p -16√41/41)^2 + (q -12√861/41)^2 + (r -0)^2 =41.

Also, Distance BD = sqrt80.

B is (sqrt41, 0, 0). So, distance squared:

(p - sqrt41)^2 + q^2 + r^2 =80.

So, we have three equations:

1. p² + q² + r² =89.

2. (p -16√41/41)^2 + (q -12√861/41)^2 + r^2 =41.

3. (p - sqrt41)^2 + q^2 + r^2 =80.

Let me write equations 1,2,3.

Equation 1: p² + q² + r² =89.

Equation 2: (p -16√41/41)^2 + (q -12√861/41)^2 + r² =41.

Equation 3: (p - sqrt41)^2 + q^2 + r² =80.

Subtract equation1 from equation3:

(p - sqrt41)^2 + q^2 + r² - (p² + q² + r²) =80 -89 → (p² - 2p sqrt41 +41) -p² = -9 → -2p sqrt41 +41= -9 → -2p sqrt41= -50 → p= (50)/(2 sqrt41) =25 / sqrt41 = (25 sqrt41)/41.

So, p=25√41 /41.

Now, substitute p into equation3:

(25√41/41 - sqrt41)^2 + q^2 + r^2 =80.

Compute the first term:

25√41/41 - sqrt41 = (25√41 -41√41)/41 = (-16√41)/41.

So, squared: (256 *41)/ (41²) =256/41.

So, equation3 becomes:

256/41 + q² + r² =80 → q² + r² =80 -256/41 = (3280 -256)/41= 3024/41.

Which is the same as b² in point C. Interesting.

Now, subtract equation1 from equation2:

Equation2 - equation1:

[ (p -16√41/41)^2 -p² ] + [ (q -12√861/41)^2 -q² ] + (r² - r²) =41 -89 → -32.

Compute each term:

First term: (p -16√41/41)^2 -p² = p² - 32p√41/41 + (256*41)/(41²) - p² = (-32p√41)/41 + 256/41.

Second term: (q -12√861/41)^2 - q² = q² -24q√861/41 + (144*861)/(41²) -q² = (-24q√861)/41 + (144*861)/ (1681).

So, overall equation2 - equation1:

(-32p√41 /41 +256/41) + (-24q√861 /41 + (144*861)/1681 ) = -32.

Multiply both sides by 41 to eliminate denominators:

-32p√41 +256 -24q√861 + (144*861)/41 = -32 *41.

Compute (144*861)/41: 861 ÷41=21, so 144*21=3024.

So,

-32p√41 +256 -24q√861 +3024 = -1312.

Combine constants:

256 +3024=3280.

So,

-32p√41 -24q√861 +3280 = -1312.

Bring constants to the other side:

-32p√41 -24q√861 = -1312 -3280 = -4592.

Divide both sides by -8:

4p√41 +3q√861 = 574.

We know p=25√41 /41. Plug that in:

4*(25√41 /41)*√41 +3q√861 =574.

Compute 4*(25√41 /41)*√41:

=4*(25*(41) /41 )

=4*25=100.

So,

100 +3q√861=574 →3q√861=474 → q=474/(3√861)=158/√861.

Rationalize denominator:

q=158√861 /861.

Simplify:

158 and861: 158=2*79; 861=3*7*41. No common factors. So, q=158√861 /861.

Now, from equation1: p² + q² + r²=89.

We have p=25√41 /41, so p²=625*41 / (41²)=625/41.

q²= (158² *861)/(861²)= (24964 *861)/(741321)= Wait, perhaps better to compute q²:

q=158√861 /861 → q²= (158² *861)/ (861²) )= (24964 *861)/ (861²)=24964 /861.

So, q²=24964 /861.

Simplify 24964 ÷861:

Divide numerator and denominator by GCD(24964,861). Let's see:

861=3*7*41

24964 ÷41: 24964 /41= 24964 ÷41= 608.878 → not integer.

Wait, perhaps compute 24964 ÷861:

861*29=24969, which is 5 more than 24964. So, 29 - 5/861≈28.993. Not helpful.

So, perhaps q²=24964 /861.

So, equation1:

p² + q² + r²=625/41 +24964/861 + r²=89.

Convert 625/41 to denominator 861:

625/41= (625*21)/861=13125/861.

Similarly, 89=89*861/861=76629/861.

So, equation:

13125/861 +24964/861 + r²=76629/861.

So,

(13125 +24964)/861 + r²=76629/861 → 38089/861 + r²=76629/861.

Thus, r²= (76629 -38089)/861=38540/861.

Simplify 38540 ÷861:

861*44=37884, 38540-37884=656.

656 ÷861=656/861.

So, r²=44 +656/861.

Wait, that seems messy. Maybe can factor numerator and denominator.

656=16*41.

861=21*41.

So, 656/861=16*41/(21*41)=16/21.

So, r²=44 +16/21=44 16/21= (44*21 +16)/21= (924 +16)/21=940/21.

So, r= sqrt(940/21)=sqrt(940)/sqrt(21).

Simplify sqrt(940):

940=4*235=4*5*47. So, sqrt(940)=2 sqrt(235).

So, r=2 sqrt(235)/sqrt(21)=2 sqrt(235*21)/21=2 sqrt(4935)/21.

Wait, 235*21=4935. Hmm, 4935 factors: 5*987=5*3*329=5*3*7*47. So, square-free.

So, r=2 sqrt(4935)/21.

Wait, that's a bit complicated, but okay.

So, now, we have the coordinates of D: (25√41 /41, 158√861 /861, 2 sqrt(4935)/21 )

Wait, maybe I made an error in calculation, because the numbers are getting messy. Let me check.

Wait, when I computed q²: (158√861 /861)^2 = (158² *861)/ (861²) )= (158²)/861.

158²=24964. So, yes, q²=24964 /861.

Similarly, p²=625/41=13125/861.

So, 13125 +24964=38089. 38089/861=44.224...

Then, 89=76629/861.

So, equation1: 38089/861 + r²=76629/861 → r²=(76629-38089)/861=38540/861.

38540 ÷861=44.76...

Wait, 861*44=37884, 38540-37884=656.

So, 656/861=16/21 as before.

So, r²=44 +16/21=940/21.

Yes, that's correct.

So, r= sqrt(940/21)=sqrt(940)/sqrt(21).

940=4*235, so sqrt(940)=2 sqrt235.

Thus, r=2 sqrt235 / sqrt21=2 sqrt(235*21)/21=2 sqrt(4935)/21.

So, that's okay.

Now, with coordinates of all four points:

A=(0,0,0)

B=(sqrt41,0,0)

C=(16√41 /41, 12√861 /41, 0 )

D=(25√41 /41, 158√861 /861, 2 sqrt(4935)/21 )

Now, the volume of tetrahedron ABCD can be found using the scalar triple product formula:

V = | (AB · (AC × AD)) | / 6

But since A is at the origin, vectors AB, AC, AD are simply the coordinates of B, C, D.

So, vectors:

AB = (sqrt41, 0, 0 )

AC = (16√41 /41, 12√861 /41, 0 )

AD = (25√41 /41, 158√861 /861, 2√4935 /21 )

Compute the cross product AC × AD first.

Let me denote AC as (a, b, 0) and AD as (c, d, e).

So, cross product:

|i    j      k|
|a    b      0|
|c    d      e|

= i*(b*e - 0*d) - j*(a*e -0*c) + k*(a*d - b*c)

= (b e, -a e, a d -b c )

So, compute each component:

b=12√861/41, e=2√4935 /21.

So, first component: b e = (12√861 /41) * (2√4935 /21 )= (24 / (41*21)) * sqrt(861*4935)

Compute 861*4935: Hmm, that's a big number. Let me see.

But perhaps we can factor it:

861=3*7*41

4935=5*987=5*3*329=5*3*7*47.

So, 861*4935=3*7*41 *5*3*7*47=3² *5 *7² *41 *47.

So, sqrt(861*4935)=3*5^(1/2)*7*sqrt(41*47).

Wait, no, wait. sqrt(3² *5 *7² *41 *47)=3*7*sqrt(5*41*47).

So, sqrt(861*4935)=21*sqrt(5*41*47)=21*sqrt(10385).

Hmm, not helpful.

But maybe it's better to just keep it as sqrt(861*4935).

So, first component: (24/(41*21)) * sqrt(861*4935) = (24/(861)) * sqrt(861*4935)=24*sqrt(4935)/sqrt(861).

Wait, since sqrt(861*4935)=sqrt(861)*sqrt(4935).

So, 24/(861) * sqrt(861)*sqrt(4935)=24*sqrt(4935)/sqrt(861).

But sqrt(4935)=sqrt(5*987)=sqrt(5*3*329)=sqrt(5*3*7*47).

Similarly, sqrt(861)=sqrt(3*7*41).

So, sqrt(4935)/sqrt(861)=sqrt(5*3*7*47 / (3*7*41))=sqrt(5*47 /41)=sqrt(235/41)=sqrt(235)/sqrt(41).

Thus, first component=24*(sqrt235 /sqrt41)=24 sqrt235 /sqrt41.

But this seems messy. Maybe I can compute the cross product numerically, but perhaps there's a better way.

Alternatively, maybe I can compute the scalar triple product without explicitly computing the cross product.

Wait, the scalar triple product is AB · (AC × AD).

Which is the determinant of the matrix with columns AB, AC, AD.

So, compute determinant:

| sqrt41    16√41/41    25√41/41 |
| 0        12√861/41   158√861/861 |
| 0             0       2√4935/21 |

This is an upper triangular matrix, so determinant is product of diagonal elements.

So, determinant= sqrt41 * (12√861 /41) * (2√4935 /21 )

Compute this:

= sqrt41 *12√861 /41 *2√4935 /21

= (12*2)/(41*21) * sqrt41 * sqrt861 * sqrt4935

= 24/(861) * sqrt(41*861*4935)

Simplify sqrt(41*861*4935):

Again, factor each:

41 is prime.

861=3*7*41.

4935=5*987=5*3*329=5*3*7*47.

So, 41*861*4935=41*(3*7*41)*(5*3*7*47)=3² *5 *7² *41² *47.

So, sqrt(41*861*4935)=41 *3 *7 *sqrt(5*47)=41*21*sqrt(235).

So, sqrt(...)=861 * sqrt(235).

So, determinant=24/(861) *861*sqrt235=24 sqrt235.

So, the scalar triple product is 24 sqrt235.

Thus, the volume V= |24 sqrt235| /6=4 sqrt235.

So, V=4√235.

Wait, that's a manageable number. So, the volume is 4√235.

Wait, let me double-check the determinant calculation:

The determinant is:

sqrt41 * (12√861 /41) * (2√4935 /21 )

= sqrt41 * (12 *2 )/(41 *21) ) * sqrt861 * sqrt4935

= sqrt41 *24/(861) * sqrt(861*4935)

As before, sqrt(861*4935)=sqrt(3²*5*7²*41*47)=3*7*sqrt(5*41*47)=21 sqrt(10385).

Wait, no, wait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier.

Wait, 861*4935=3*7*41 *5*3*7*47=3²*5*7²*41*47.

So, sqrt(861*4935)=3*7*sqrt(5*41*47)=21 sqrt(10385).

Wait, 5*41=205, 205*47=9635. So, sqrt(861*4935)=21 sqrt(9635).

Wait, but 9635 factors: 5*1927=5*13*149. So, it's square-free.

Wait, so sqrt(861*4935)=21 sqrt(9635).

So, going back:

determinant= sqrt41 *24/(861) *21 sqrt(9635)

= sqrt41 *24/(861) *21 sqrt(9635)

= sqrt41 *24*21 /861 * sqrt(9635)

Simplify 24*21=504; 504/861=504/(861)= divides numerator and denominator by 21: 24/41.

So, 504/861=24/41.

Thus, determinant= sqrt41 *24/41 * sqrt(9635)

= (24 sqrt41 sqrt9635)/41

So, sqrt41 sqrt9635= sqrt(41*9635).

Compute 41*9635: 41*9000=369000; 41*635=26035; sum=369000+26035=395035.

So, sqrt(395035).

Wait, but 395035 factors: 5*79007=5*79007. 79007 is a prime? Not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps 395035=5*79007. Let me check 79007: 79007 ÷7=11286.714… not integer. 79007 ÷13=6077.46… Not integer. Maybe it's prime.

So, sqrt(395035)=sqrt(5*79007).

So, determinant=24 sqrt(5*79007)/41.

Which is messy, but in any case, the scalar triple product is this, so the volume would be this divided by 6.

But earlier, I thought the determinant was 24 sqrt235, but that seems inconsistent.

Wait, I think I made a mistake in the earlier step.

Wait, when I thought the determinant was upper triangular, but actually, the matrix is:

[ sqrt41, 16√41/41, 25√41/41 ]

[ 0, 12√861/41, 158√861/861 ]

[ 0, 0, 2√4935/21 ]

Which is indeed upper triangular, so determinant is product of diagonals: sqrt41 * (12√861/41) * (2√4935/21 )

So, compute:

sqrt41 *12√861 /41 *2√4935 /21

= (12*2)/(41*21) * sqrt41 * sqrt861 * sqrt4935

= 24/(861) * sqrt(41 *861*4935 )

As before.

But 41*861*4935=41*(3*7*41)*(5*3*7*47)=3² *5 *7² *41² *47.

So, sqrt(41*861*4935)=3*7*41*sqrt(5*47)=861 sqrt(235).

So, sqrt(41 *861 *4935 )=861 sqrt235.

Thus, determinant=24/(861) *861 sqrt235=24 sqrt235.

Yes, that makes sense. So, the scalar triple product is 24 sqrt235, so volume V=24 sqrt235 /6=4 sqrt235.

So, V=4√235.

Great, so the volume is 4√235.

Now, I need the surface area S.

Each face is a triangle, and since opposite edges are equal, perhaps opposite faces have equal areas.

Let's compute the area of one face and then multiply by 2 if possible.

Let me compute the area of face ABC.

Face ABC has edges AB=√41, BC=√89, AC=√80.

Using Heron's formula:

s=(√41 +√89 +√80)/2.

Compute s:

But this might be messy. Alternatively, since I have the coordinates of the points, I can compute the area using the cross product.

Points:

A=(0,0,0)

B=(√41, 0, 0 )

C=(16√41 /41, 12√861 /41, 0 )

So, vectors AB=(√41,0,0), AC=(16√41/41, 12√861/41, 0 )

Compute cross product AB × AC.

AB × AC = |i    j     k|
           |√41  0     0|
           |16√41/41 12√861/41 0|

= i*(0*0 -0*12√861/41) - j*(√41*0 -0*16√41/41) + k*(√41*(12√861/41) -0*(16√41/41))

= i*0 - j*0 + k*(√41 *12√861 /41 )

= (0, 0, (12√(41*861))/41 )

Compute 41*861: 41*800=32800, 41*61=2501 → total=32800+2501=35301.

So, 41*861=35301.

So, the cross product is (0,0,12√35301 /41 )

The magnitude of this vector is 12√35301 /41.

But 35301=41*861, so sqrt(35301)=sqrt(41*861)=sqrt(41)*sqrt(861).

So, magnitude=12*sqrt41*sqrt861 /41=12 sqrt861 /sqrt41.

Wait, sqrt861= sqrt(3*7*41)=sqrt(3*7)*sqrt41.

So, sqrt861/sqrt41= sqrt(21).

Thus, magnitude=12*sqrt21.

So, area of face ABC is half of this: (12√21)/2=6√21.

So, area ABC=6√21.

Similarly, face ADC: since AC=√80, AD=√89, CD=√41. So, same as face ABC.

So, area ADC=6√21.

Similarly, faces ABD and BCD: let's check.

Face ABD: edges AB=√41, BD=√80, AD=√89.

Same as face ABC, so area=6√21.

Face BCD: edges BC=√89, CD=√41, BD=√80. Same as others. So, area=6√21.

So, all four faces have area 6√21. Thus, total surface area S=4*6√21=24√21.

So, S=24√21.

Now, the inradius r=3V/S.

V=4√235, S=24√21.

So, r=3*(4√235)/(24√21)= (12√235)/(24√21)= (√235)/(2√21).

Simplify:

Multiply numerator and denominator by sqrt21:

r= sqrt235 * sqrt21 / (2*21)= sqrt(235*21)/42.

Compute 235*21=4935.

So, r= sqrt4935 /42.

Simplify sqrt4935:

4935=5*987=5*3*329=5*3*7*47.

No square factors, so sqrt4935 is simplified.

Thus, r= sqrt4935 /42.

But the problem states that the distance can be written as m√n /p, where m and p are coprime, and n is square-free.

sqrt4935= sqrt(5*3*7*47). All primes, so n=4935 is square-free? Wait, no, 4935 is 5*3*7*47, which is square-free because all exponents are 1. So, yes, n=4935.

But 4935 and42: let's see if 4935 and42 have common factors.

42=2*3*7.

4935=5*3*7*47.

So, common factors: 3 and7.

So, GCD(4935,42)=21.

Thus, we can reduce the fraction sqrt4935 /42.

Divide numerator and denominator by 21:

sqrt4935 /42= (sqrt4935 /21)/2.

But 4935=21*235.

So, sqrt4935= sqrt(21*235)=sqrt21 *sqrt235.

Thus, sqrt4935 /21= sqrt235 /sqrt21.

Wait, but that complicates it. Alternatively, perhaps factor 21 out.

Wait, but to make m and p coprime, let's write it as:

sqrt4935 /42= (sqrt4935)/42= (sqrt(4935))/(42).

But since 4935=21*235, and 21 and42 share a factor of21.

So, sqrt(21*235)/42= sqrt21*sqrt235 /42= sqrt235/(2*sqrt21).

Wait, no, that's going back.

Alternatively, write sqrt4935 as sqrt(4935)=sqrt(4935), so the fraction is sqrt4935 /42. But 4935 and42 have a GCD of21, so:

sqrt4935 /42= (sqrt4935)/ (21*2)= (sqrt4935 /21)/2.

But sqrt4935= sqrt(21*235)=sqrt21 *sqrt235.

So, sqrt4935 /21= sqrt235 /sqrt21.

Thus, r= (sqrt235 /sqrt21)/2= sqrt235/(2 sqrt21).

Rationalize denominator:

sqrt235/(2 sqrt21)= sqrt(235*21)/(2*21)= sqrt4935 /42.

Which is the same as before.

So, it seems that r= sqrt4935 /42.

But 4935=5*987=5*3*329=5*3*7*47. So, n=4935.

But the problem states that n should not be divisible by the square of any prime. Since 4935 is square-free, that's okay.

But wait, is 4935 square-free? Let's check.

4935=5 * 987=5*(3*329)=5*3*(7*47). So, no square factors. Correct.

So, r= sqrt4935 /42. But 42=2*3*7, and 4935=5*3*7*47. So, m=1, n=4935, p=42.

But wait, m and p should be coprime. GCD(1,42)=1, so it's okay.

But maybe we can simplify sqrt4935 /42 further.

Wait, 4935=21*235, and 21 and42 share a factor.

Wait, let me try:

sqrt4935 /42= sqrt(21*235)/(42)=sqrt21*sqrt235 / (42)= sqrt235/(2 sqrt21).

But that introduces a radical in the denominator. Alternatively, we can write it as sqrt4935 /42, but perhaps the problem expects a simplified form where the denominator is rationalized.

Alternatively, perhaps there's a miscalculation earlier.

Wait, let's check the inradius formula again.

r=3V/S.

V=4√235, S=24√21.

So, r=3*(4√235)/(24√21)= (12√235)/(24√21)= (√235)/(2√21).

Yes, earlier steps correct.

So, r=√235/(2√21).

Rationalizing the denominator:

Multiply numerator and denominator by sqrt21:

r=√235 * sqrt21 / (2*21)= sqrt(235*21)/42= sqrt4935 /42.

So, both forms are correct. But the problem specifies the form m√n /p, with n square-free.

So, in the form √235/(2√21), n would be 235*21=4935, which is square-free.

Alternatively, in the form sqrt4935 /42, n=4935.

Either way, the problem says n is not divisible by the square of any prime, which is true.

But perhaps the problem expects the answer written as sqrt4935 /42, so m=1, n=4935, p=42.

But m and p must be coprime. Are 1 and42 coprime? Yes.

But the problem says m, n, p are positive integers, m and p are relatively prime, and n is square-free.

So, this is acceptable.

But 4935 is a big number, so perhaps I made a miscalculation.

Wait, wait, let me see. When I computed the cross product for face ABC, I got the magnitude as 12√21, so area is 6√21. So, each face is 6√21, so total surface area is4*6√21=24√21.

Volume was 4√235.

So, r=3V/S=3*(4√235)/(24√21)=√235/(2√21)=sqrt(235)/ (2 sqrt21)=sqrt(235*21)/ (2*21)=sqrt4935 /42.

Yes, so that is correct.

So, the distance is sqrt4935 /42.

But 4935 factors as 5*987=5*3*329=5*3*7*47. So, n=4935.

Thus, m=1, n=4935, p=42.

But wait, that seems a very large n. Maybe I made a mistake in the cross product calculation.

Wait, when I computed the cross product AB × AC for face ABC, I got (0,0,12√21). Wait, let me recheck.

Wait, vectors AB=(√41,0,0), AC=(16√41/41, 12√861/41,0 )

Compute cross product:

i*(0*0 -0*12√861/41 ) - j*(√41*0 -0*16√41/41 ) + k*(√41*(12√861/41) -0*(16√41/41 )).

So, cross product is (0,0, (√41 *12√861)/41 ).

Which is (0,0,12√(41*861)/41 )

But 41*861=41*(3*7*41)=3*7*41².

So, sqrt(41*861)=sqrt(3*7*41² )=41 sqrt21.

Thus, cross product magnitude is 12*41 sqrt21 /41=12 sqrt21.

So, area is 12 sqrt21 /2=6 sqrt21. That's correct.

So, face area is 6√21, total surface area 24√21.

Volume is 4√235.

Thus, r=3*(4√235)/(24√21)= √235/(2√21)=sqrt4935/42.

So, yes, that's correct.

But 4935 is quite large. Let me see if I can write it as a multiple of smaller square-free numbers.

But 4935=5*987=5*3*329=5*3*7*47.

No, it's already square-free.

Thus, the answer is sqrt4935 /42, which is in the form m√n /p, where m=1, n=4935, p=42.

So, m +n +p=1+4935+42=4978.

Wait, that seems too big. Maybe I made a mistake earlier.

Wait, let me check the volume calculation again.

Earlier, I used the scalar triple product and got V=4√235. Let me see if that's correct.

The scalar triple product is AB · (AC × AD).

AB=(√41,0,0), AC=(16√41/41,12√861/41,0 ), AD=(25√41 /41, 158√861 /861, 2√4935 /21 )

Compute AC × AD:

Let me compute it step by step.

Let AC=(a, b, 0), AD=(c, d, e).

So, AC × AD= (b e -0*d, 0*c -a e, a d -b c )

Compute each component:

First component: b e= (12√861 /41 )*(2√4935 /21 )=24 sqrt(861*4935)/(41*21 )

As before, 861*4935=41*861*4935/(41)=861*4935= which is 3² *5 *7² *41 *47.

So, sqrt(861*4935)=3*7*sqrt(5*41*47)=21 sqrt(10385).

Wait, no, 5*41=205, 205*47=9635.

So, sqrt(861*4935)=21 sqrt(9635).

So, first component:24/(41*21)*21 sqrt(9635)=24 sqrt(9635)/41.

Second component: 0*c -a e= -a e= -√41*(2√4935 /21 )= -2 sqrt(41*4935)/21.

41*4935=41*(5*987)=41*5*3*7*47=5*3*7*41*47.

So, sqrt(41*4935)=sqrt(5*3*7*41*47)=sqrt(4935).

Thus, second component= -2 sqrt4935 /21.

Third component: a d -b c= √41*(158√861 /861 ) - (12√861 /41 )*(25√41 /41 )

Compute each term:

First term: √41*(158√861 /861 )=158 sqrt(41*861)/861.

41*861=35301.

sqrt(41*861)=sqrt(35301)=187.91… Wait, but 35301=41*861=41*(3*7*41)=3*7*41².

So, sqrt(35301)=41 sqrt(21).

Thus, first term=158*41 sqrt21 /861=158 sqrt21 /21.

Second term: (12√861 /41 )*(25√41 /41 )=12*25 sqrt(861*41)/ (41*41 )

=300 sqrt(35301)/1681.

But sqrt(35301)=41 sqrt21, so:

=300*41 sqrt21 /1681= (300/41) sqrt21.

Thus, third component=158 sqrt21 /21 - (300/41) sqrt21.

Compute 158/21= approximately 7.5238, and 300/41≈7.317.

But exact calculation:

158 sqrt21 /21 -300 sqrt21 /41= sqrt21*(158/21 -300/41 )

Compute 158/21= (158*41)/(21*41 )=6478/861.

300/41= (300*21)/(41*21 )=6300/861.

So,

sqrt21*(6478/861 -6300/861 )= sqrt21*(178/861 )= (178 sqrt21)/861.

Simplify 178 and861: 178=2*89; 861=3*7*41. No common factors.

So, third component=178 sqrt21 /861.

Thus, AC × AD= (24 sqrt9635 /41, -2 sqrt4935 /21, 178 sqrt21 /861 )

Wait, that's a complicated vector.

Then, AB · (AC × AD )= (√41,0,0 ) · (24 sqrt9635 /41, -2 sqrt4935 /21, 178 sqrt21 /861 )

= √41 *24 sqrt9635 /41 +0 +0=24 sqrt(41*9635)/41.

Compute 41*9635=41*9635=41*(9000+635)=369000 +26035=395035.

sqrt395035= same as before, which is sqrt(5*79007).

But 79007 is a prime, I think. So, sqrt395035= sqrt(5*79007).

Thus, AB · (AC × AD )=24 sqrt(5*79007)/41.

But this contradicts my earlier conclusion that the scalar triple product was 24 sqrt235.

Wait, so something is wrong here. There must be a mistake in the cross product calculation.

Wait, earlier I thought the cross product was (0,0,12 sqrt21 ), but now when I compute it step by step, it's different.

Wait, perhaps I messed up the cross product components.

Wait, let me recompute the cross product AC × AD.

Given AC=(16√41 /41, 12√861 /41, 0 )

and AD=(25√41 /41, 158√861 /861, 2√4935 /21 )

So, let me denote:

AC = (a, b, 0 )

AD = (c, d, e )

Then,

AC × AD= (b e - 0*d, 0*c - a e, a d - b c )

So,

First component: b e= (12√861 /41 )*(2√4935 /21 )

=24√(861*4935)/(41*21 )

=24√(861*4935)/861

Second component: -a e= - (16√41 /41 )*(2√4935 /21 )

= -32√(41*4935)/(41*21 )

Third component: a d -b c= (16√41 /41 )*(158√861 /861 ) - (12√861 /41 )*(25√41 /41 )

Compute each term:

First term: (16√41 /41 )*(158√861 /861 )=16*158 sqrt(41*861 )/(41*861 )

=2528 sqrt(35301 )/(41*861 )

But 35301=41*861, so sqrt(35301 )=sqrt(41*861 )=sqrt(41)*sqrt(861 )

Thus,

=2528 sqrt41 sqrt861 / (41*861 )

=2528 sqrt861 / (861 )

=2528 /861 * sqrt861.

Simplify 2528 ÷861: 861*2=1722; 2528-1722=806. So, 2 +806/861.

806 and861: GCD(806,861). 861-806=55; 806 ÷55=14.65… 55*14=770, 806-770=36. 55 and36. GCD is 1. So, 806/861=806/861.

So, first term=2 +806/861 * sqrt861.

Wait, but this is getting too complicated. Perhaps I should calculate numerically.

Wait, maybe an alternative approach: using vectors AB, AC, AD.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier in considering the cross product as upper triangular. Let me recompute the scalar triple product.

The scalar triple product is AB · (AC × AD ).

Which is determinant of the matrix with columns AB, AC, AD.

So, let's compute this determinant:

| sqrt41    16√41/41    25√41/41 |
| 0        12√861/41   158√861/861 |
| 0             0       2√4935/21 |

Wait, this is an upper triangular matrix, so determinant is product of diagonals.

So, determinant= sqrt41 * (12√861 /41 ) * (2√4935 /21 )

= sqrt41 *12√861 *2√4935 / (41 *21 )

= 24 sqrt41 sqrt861 sqrt4935 / (861 )

=24 sqrt(41 *861 *4935 ) /861.

Compute 41 *861=35301.

35301 *4935=35301*4935. Let me compute that:

35301 *4935= ?

Wait, perhaps factor out:

35301=3*7*41²

4935=5*3*7*47.

So, 35301*4935=3² *5 *7² *41² *47.

So, sqrt(35301*4935)=3*7*41*sqrt(5*47)=861*sqrt(235).

Thus, sqrt(41 *861 *4935 )=sqrt(35301 *4935 )=861 sqrt235.

So, determinant=24 *861 sqrt235 /861=24 sqrt235.

Yes, that's correct. So, the scalar triple product is 24 sqrt235, so volume V=24 sqrt235 /6=4 sqrt235.

So, the volume is indeed correct.

Thus, the inradius r=3V/S= (12 sqrt235 )/(24 sqrt21 )= sqrt235/(2 sqrt21 )= sqrt4935 /42.

So, the answer is sqrt4935 /42, which is in the form m√n /p with m=1, n=4935, p=42.

But 4935 is 5*987=5*3*329=5*3*7*47, which is square-free. So, n=4935.

Thus, m +n +p=1 +4935 +42=4978.

Wait, but 4978 seems too large. Maybe I made a mistake in the inradius formula.

Wait, another thought: in a tetrahedron, the inradius is given by r=3V/S, but is that correct?

Wait, in 3D, the formula for the inradius is r=3V/S, where S is the total surface area.

Yes, that's correct.

But to double-check, in a regular tetrahedron, the inradius is r= (a√6)/12, where a is edge length.

Let me verify with a regular tetrahedron with edge length a.

Volume V= a³/(6√2 ), surface area S=4*(√3 a²/4 )=√3 a².

So, r=3V/S=3*(a³/(6√2 )) / (√3 a² )= (a/(2√2 )) / (√3 )=a/(2√6 )=a√6 /12. Correct.

So, the formula holds.

Thus, in our case, V=4√235, S=24√21.

So, r=3*(4√235 )/(24√21 )= (12√235 )/(24√21 )=√235/(2√21 )=sqrt4935 /42.

Yes, correct.

But maybe the problem expects a different approach.

Wait, perhaps I can find the inradius using another formula. Wait, in a disphenoid, the inradius can be calculated using the formula r= sqrt( (a² + b² - c²)(a² + b² + c²)(-a² + b² + c²) )/( 12V ).

Wait, no, that's not correct.

Alternatively, perhaps I can find the inradius from the formula involving the volume and surface area, which I already did.

So, given that, the answer is sqrt4935 /42, so m +n +p=1 +4935 +42=4978.

But I feel like this might be incorrect because the problem is from a competition and the answer is usually smaller.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the surface area calculation.

Wait, each face is a triangle with sides √41, √80, √89.

So, using Heron's formula, area= sqrt[s(s -a)(s -b)(s -c) ]

Where s=(a +b +c )/2.

Compute s for one face:

s=(√41 +√80 +√89 )/2.

But this is messy, so maybe I can compute the area using vectors as I did earlier, which gave 6√21 per face.

But wait, if each face is 6√21, then total surface area is 24√21.

But let me compute the area using Heron's formula.

Compute s=(√41 +√80 +√89 )/2.

Compute numerically:

√41≈6.4031, √80≈8.9443, √89≈9.4332.

Sum≈6.4031 +8.9443 +9.4332≈24.7806.

s≈24.7806 /2≈12.3903.

Now, compute s -a=12.3903 -6.4031≈5.9872.

s -b=12.3903 -8.9443≈3.446.

s -c=12.3903 -9.4332≈2.9571.

So, area= sqrt(12.3903 *5.9872 *3.446 *2.9571 ).

Compute product inside sqrt:

12.3903 *5.9872≈12.3903*6≈74.3418, but exact:

12.3903 *5.9872≈12.3903*5 +12.3903*0.9872≈61.9515 +12.3903*0.9872.

Compute 12.3903*0.9872≈12.3903*(1 -0.0128 )≈12.3903 -0.1589≈12.2314.

So, total≈61.9515 +12.2314≈74.1829.

Then, 74.1829 *3.446≈74.1829*3 +74.1829*0.446≈222.5487 +33.036≈255.5847.

Then, 255.5847 *2.9571≈255.5847*3 -255.5847*0.0429≈766.7541 -11.046≈755.708.

So, area≈sqrt(755.708 )≈27.5.

But earlier, using vectors, I got face area=6√21≈6*4.583≈27.5. So, that's consistent.

So, area≈27.5, which is 6√21≈27.5.

Thus, the surface area S=4*6√21=24√21≈4*27.5=110.

So, that's correct.

Thus, r=3V/S=3*(4√235 )/(24√21 )=√235/(2√21 )=sqrt4935 /42.

So, the answer is sqrt4935 /42, so m +n +p=1 +4935 +42=4978.

But I think that must be correct given the calculations. So, the answer is 4978.

The problem involves finding the distance from the incenter of a tetrahedron to its faces. The tetrahedron has specific edge lengths, and the inradius can be found using the volume and surface area. After calculating the volume using the Cayley-Menger determinant and the surface area by recognizing congruent faces, the inradius is determined to be √4935 / 42. Summing the components gives 1 + 4935 + 42 = 4978.

$\boxed{4978}$
