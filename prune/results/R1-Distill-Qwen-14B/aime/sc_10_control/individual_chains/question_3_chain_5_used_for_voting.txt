Okay, so I have this probability problem here about Jen entering a lottery. Let me try to understand it step by step.

Jen picks 4 distinct numbers from the set S = {1,2,3,...,10}. Then, 4 numbers are randomly chosen from S as well. She wins a prize if at least two of her numbers match the randomly chosen ones. She wins the grand prize if all four of her numbers match. The question is about the probability that she won the grand prize given that she won a prize. They mention this probability is m/n, where m and n are coprime, and we need to find m + n.

Hmm, okay. So, this is a conditional probability problem. I remember that conditional probability is about the probability of an event given that another event has occurred. The formula is P(A|B) = P(A ∩ B) / P(B), right? So in this case, event A is winning the grand prize, and event B is winning a prize. So we need to find P(A|B) = P(A and B) / P(B). But since winning the grand prize is a subset of winning a prize, P(A and B) is just P(A). So, the formula simplifies to P(A|B) = P(A) / P(B).

So, first, let me find P(A), the probability of winning the grand prize. Then, find P(B), the probability of winning a prize. Then, divide them to get the conditional probability.

Starting with P(A): Winning the grand prize means that all four numbers Jen picked are the ones chosen. Since the lottery is choosing 4 numbers out of 10, the probability that Jen's specific 4 numbers are chosen is 1 divided by the number of ways to choose 4 numbers from 10.

The number of ways to choose 4 numbers from 10 is the combination C(10,4). So, P(A) = 1 / C(10,4). Let me calculate that.

C(10,4) is 10! / (4! * (10-4)!) = (10*9*8*7)/(4*3*2*1) = 210. So, P(A) = 1/210.

Now, onto P(B): the probability of winning a prize, which is having at least two numbers matching. So, she wins a prize if she has exactly 2, 3, or 4 numbers matching the randomly chosen ones.

I think the way to calculate P(B) is to compute the probability of having exactly 2 matches, exactly 3 matches, and exactly 4 matches, then add them all together. Alternatively, since it's sometimes easier, we can compute the probability of the complementary event (having fewer than 2 matches, i.e., 0 or 1 matches) and subtract that from 1.

Let me think which approach is better. Maybe the complementary approach is simpler because calculating the probabilities for 0, 1, 2, 3, 4 matches might involve more terms. Let me try that.

So, the total number of ways the lottery can choose 4 numbers is C(10,4) = 210, as before.

The number of ways Jen can have 0 matches: this means none of her 4 numbers are chosen. So, the lottery chooses 4 numbers all from the 6 numbers Jen didn't pick. The number of such combinations is C(6,4). Let me compute that: C(6,4) = 15. So, the number of ways for 0 matches is 15.

Similarly, the number of ways for exactly 1 match: we choose 1 number from Jen's 4, and the remaining 3 from the other 6. So, that's C(4,1)*C(6,3). C(4,1) is 4, and C(6,3) is 20. So, 4*20=80.

So, the number of ways for 0 or 1 matches is 15 + 80 = 95.

Therefore, the number of ways for at least 2 matches is total minus 95, which is 210 - 95 = 115.

Therefore, P(B) = 115 / 210.

Wait, let me double-check that. Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the number of favorable outcomes for exactly 2, 3, and 4 matches and add them up.

Number of ways for exactly 2 matches: C(4,2)*C(6,2). Because we choose 2 correct numbers from Jen's 4, and 2 incorrect numbers from the remaining 6. So, C(4,2)=6, C(6,2)=15. So, 6*15=90.

For exactly 3 matches: C(4,3)*C(6,1) = 4*6=24.

For exactly 4 matches: C(4,4)*C(6,0)=1*1=1.

So, adding them up: 90 + 24 + 1 = 115. Yep, same as before. So, P(B) = 115 / 210.

Simplify that fraction: both numerator and denominator are divisible by 5? 115 ÷5=23, 210 ÷5=42. So, 23/42. Wait, 23 is a prime number, so 23 and 42 have no common factors besides 1. So, P(B)=23/42.

Wait a minute, wait. Wait, 115/210 simplifies to (115 ÷5)/(210 ÷5) = 23/42. Yes, that's correct.

So, P(A) is 1/210, and P(B) is 23/42. So, the conditional probability P(A|B) is (1/210) / (23/42).

Let me compute that: (1/210) ÷ (23/42) = (1/210) * (42/23) = (42)/(210*23) = (1)/(5*23) = 1/115.

Wait, that seems too small. Let me check the calculations again.

Wait, 1/210 divided by 23/42 is equal to (1/210) multiplied by (42/23). So, 42/210 is 1/5. So, 1/210 * 42/23 = (42)/(210*23) = 1/(5*23) = 1/115.

Hmm, okay, so the probability is 1/115. So, m is 1, n is 115. Are they coprime? Yes, 1 and 115 share no common factors besides 1. So, m + n is 1 + 115 = 116.

Wait, but wait a second. Let me think again. Is this correct? Because 1/115 seems a bit low, but considering that winning the grand prize is extremely rare compared to just winning a prize, it might make sense.

Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in calculating P(B). Let me check.

Total ways to choose 4 numbers: C(10,4)=210.

Number of ways to have exactly 2 matches: C(4,2)*C(6,2)=6*15=90.

Exactly 3: C(4,3)*C(6,1)=4*6=24.

Exactly 4: C(4,4)=1.

Total for at least 2: 90 + 24 +1=115. So, 115/210=23/42. So that's correct.

And P(A) is 1/210.

So, P(A|B)= (1/210)/(115/210)=1/115.

Yes, that seems correct.

Wait, but another thought: when computing P(B), is that the conditional probability given that she picked 4 numbers? Or is it just the total?

Wait, no, in this setup, the lottery is selecting 4 numbers, and Jen has her 4 numbers. So, when we compute P(B), it's the probability that at least two of her numbers are in the lottery's 4. So, yes, it's 115/210, which is 23/42.

Thus, the conditional probability is (1/210)/(23/42)=1/115.

So, the answer is 1/115, so m+n=1+115=116.

Therefore, the final answer is 116.

To solve the problem, we need to find the probability that Jen wins the grand prize given that she won a prize. This is a conditional probability problem where we use the formula \( P(A|B) = \frac{P(A \cap B)}{P(B)} \). Here, \( A \) is the event of winning the grand prize, and \( B \) is the event of winning a prize.

1. **Calculate \( P(A) \):**  
   The probability of winning the grand prize is the probability that all four of Jen's numbers match the randomly chosen numbers.  
   \[
   P(A) = \frac{1}{\binom{10}{4}} = \frac{1}{210}
   \]

2. **Calculate \( P(B) \):**  
   The probability of winning a prize is the probability of having at least two numbers matching. We use the complementary probability approach to find this:  
   - The number of ways to choose 4 numbers from 10 is \( \binom{10}{4} = 210 \).  
   - The number of ways to have 0 matches: \( \binom{6}{4} = 15 \).  
   - The number of ways to have 1 match: \( \binom{4}{1} \cdot \binom{6}{3} = 4 \cdot 20 = 80 \).  
   - Total ways for 0 or 1 matches: \( 15 + 80 = 95 \).  
   - Therefore, the number of ways for at least 2 matches: \( 210 - 95 = 115 \).  
   \[
   P(B) = \frac{115}{210} = \frac{23}{42}
   \]

3. **Calculate the conditional probability \( P(A|B) \):**  
   \[
   P(A|B) = \frac{P(A)}{P(B)} = \frac{\frac{1}{210}}{\frac{23}{42}} = \frac{1}{210} \cdot \frac{42}{23} = \frac{1}{115}
   \]

4. **Simplify and find \( m + n \):**  
   The fraction \( \frac{1}{115} \) is in its simplest form, so \( m = 1 \) and \( n = 115 \).  
   \[
   m + n = 1 + 115 = 116
   \]

The final answer is \( \boxed{116} \).
