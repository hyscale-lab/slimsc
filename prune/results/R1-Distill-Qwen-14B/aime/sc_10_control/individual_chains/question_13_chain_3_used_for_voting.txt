Okay, so I've got this math problem here about Aya's morning walks. Let me try to figure it out step by step. 

So, the problem says that every morning, Aya goes for a 9-kilometer-long walk and stops at a coffee shop afterward. Sometimes she walks at a constant speed of s kilometers per hour, and other times she walks faster, at s + 2 km/h. The problem gives me two scenarios: one at speed s, taking 4 hours including t minutes in the coffee shop, and another at s+2, taking 2 hours and 24 minutes, also including t minutes in the coffee shop. 

The question is asking me to find the number of minutes her walk takes, including t minutes in the coffee shop, when she walks at s + 1/2 kilometers per hour. 

Hmm, let's break this down. First, I think I should figure out what s is because that seems like a key piece of information. Once I know s, I can compute the time it takes when her speed is s + 1/2.

Wait, but how do I find s? Well, the problem gives me two different scenarios with different speeds and different total times. The distance she walks is the same in both cases, 9 km. The difference is her walking speed and the total time taken, which includes both the walking time and the coffee shop time. 

So, let me write down the first scenario. When she walks at speed s km/h, the total time is 4 hours, which includes t minutes in the coffee shop. Wait, but 4 hours is the total time, so that means the time she spends walking is 4 hours minus t minutes. But t is in minutes, so I need to convert units to make everything consistent. Maybe I should convert everything into hours or everything into minutes.

Let me think. Maybe it's easier to convert t into hours because her speed is in km per hour. So, t minutes is t/60 hours. So, the walking time in the first scenario is 4 - t/60 hours. 

Since distance equals speed multiplied by time, I can write the equation for the first scenario as:

9 = s * (4 - t/60)

Similarly, in the second scenario, she walks at s + 2 km/h, and the total time is 2 hours and 24 minutes. Let me convert 24 minutes into hours: 24/60 = 0.4 hours. So 2.4 hours total. Again, the total time includes t minutes, which is t/60 hours. So the walking time here is 2.4 - t/60 hours.

So, the equation for the second scenario is:

9 = (s + 2) * (2.4 - t/60)

Now I have two equations with two variables, s and t. I can solve these simultaneously to find s and t.

Let me write down the two equations:

1) 9 = s * (4 - t/60)
2) 9 = (s + 2) * (2.4 - t/60)

Hmm, maybe I can set the expressions for time equal since both equal 9.

So, from equation 1, (4 - t/60) = 9/s

From equation 2, (2.4 - t/60) = 9/(s + 2)

So, now I have:

4 - t/60 = 9/s  --> Equation A

2.4 - t/60 = 9/(s + 2) --> Equation B

Now, subtract equation B from equation A to eliminate t/60.

(4 - t/60) - (2.4 - t/60) = 9/s - 9/(s + 2)

Simplify the left side: 4 - t/60 - 2.4 + t/60 = (4 - 2.4) = 1.6

Right side: 9/s - 9/(s + 2) = 9 [1/s - 1/(s + 2)]

So, 1.6 = 9 [ (s + 2 - s) / (s(s + 2)) ) ] 

Simplify the numerator: s + 2 - s = 2

So, 1.6 = 9 * (2) / (s(s + 2)) )

Which simplifies to 1.6 = 18 / (s(s + 2))

Now, I can write this as:

s(s + 2) = 18 / 1.6

Compute 18 / 1.6. Let's see, 1.6 is 8/5, so 18 divided by (8/5) is 18 * (5/8) = (90)/8 = 11.25

So, s(s + 2) = 11.25

Expanding the left side: s^2 + 2s = 11.25

Bring all terms to one side: s^2 + 2s - 11.25 = 0

So, I have a quadratic equation: s^2 + 2s - 11.25 = 0

I can solve this using the quadratic formula. The quadratic is in the form ax^2 + bx + c = 0, where a=1, b=2, c=-11.25.

So, discriminant D = b^2 - 4ac = (2)^2 - 4(1)(-11.25) = 4 + 45 = 49

Square root of D is 7.

So, solutions are s = [-b ± sqrt(D)]/(2a) = [-2 ±7]/2

So, s = (-2 +7)/2 = 5/2 = 2.5 or s = (-2 -7)/2 = -9/2 = -4.5

But speed can't be negative, so s = 2.5 km/h.

Hmm, so s is 2.5 km/h. Now, I can plug this back into equation A to find t.

Equation A: 4 - t/60 = 9/s

s = 2.5, so 9/s = 9/2.5 = 3.6

So, 4 - t/60 = 3.6

Subtract 3.6 from both sides: 0.4 = t/60

Multiply both sides by 60: t = 0.4 * 60 = 24 minutes.

So, t is 24 minutes. Wait, that's quite a long coffee break. But okay, maybe she likes her coffee.

Now, the question is: when she walks at s + 1/2 km/h, how long does her walk take, including t minutes?

So, first, her speed is s + 1/2. Since s is 2.5, that's 2.5 + 0.5 = 3 km/h.

So, walking speed is 3 km/h. The distance is still 9 km.

Time taken to walk is distance divided by speed: 9 / 3 = 3 hours.

Wait, but that's just the walking time. The total time including t minutes is 3 hours + 24 minutes.

Wait, but let me double-check. The problem says when she walks at s km/h, the total time is 4 hours, which includes t minutes. So, similar to that, when she walks at s + 1/2, the walking time is 3 hours, and then she spends t minutes, so total time is 3 + t minutes.

Wait, but let me make sure I'm interpreting the question correctly. The problem says, "the number of minutes the walk takes her, including the t minutes spent in the coffee shop."

So, I think the total time is walking time plus coffee time, so it's 3 hours (walking) + 24 minutes (coffee) = 3 hours 24 minutes. But wait, the problem says "the walk takes her", including the coffee shop time. So yes, the total time, which includes both walking and coffee.

But wait, earlier, for speed s, the total time was 4 hours, which included t minutes. So, walking time was 4 hours minus t/60 hours, which in that case, t was 24 minutes, so walking time was 3.6 hours, which is 3 hours 36 minutes? Wait, no, in the first scenario, she walked at 2.5 km/h for 4 hours total, which included t minutes. Wait, but if s is 2.5, then the walking time is 9 / 2.5 = 3.6 hours, which is 3 hours and 36 minutes. But the total time is 4 hours, so t must be 4 hours - 3.6 hours = 0.4 hours, which is 24 minutes. So that makes sense.

So, applying the same logic, when she walks at 3 km/h, the walking time is 9 / 3 = 3 hours. So, the total time including coffee is 3 hours + 24 minutes = 3 hours 24 minutes, which is 3*60 +24 = 204 minutes.

But wait, the problem says "the number of minutes the walk takes her, including the t minutes spent in the coffee shop." So, yes, 3 hours 24 minutes is 204 minutes.

Wait, but let me just make sure I didn't make a mistake in calculating the time when the speed is s + 1/2.

So, s is 2.5, so s + 1/2 is 3. So, speed is 3 km/h, distance is 9 km.

Time taken: 9 / 3 = 3 hours. So, that's 3 hours walking. Then she spends t minutes, which is 24 minutes. So, total time is 3 hours and 24 minutes, which is 204 minutes.

So, is 204 the correct answer? Let me just check my earlier steps.

First, I found s = 2.5 km/h and t = 24 minutes. Then, when she walks at 3 km/h, time is 3 hours, so total including coffee is 3 + 0.4 hours? Wait, no, wait: 3 hours is 180 minutes, plus 24 minutes is 204 minutes. That seems correct.

Alternatively, I can think in terms of equations.

Alternatively, maybe I can express everything in minutes to make it more consistent.

Let me try that approach.

So, first scenario:

Total time = 4 hours = 240 minutes. Walking time = 240 - t minutes.

At speed s, distance = 9 km = s * (240 - t)/60.

Because speed is km/h, so time should be in hours. Wait, maybe this approach is complicating. Alternatively, maybe I should think in terms of km per minute.

But perhaps the approach I took earlier is correct. Let me just recap.

I converted t into hours, set up two equations, solved for s and t, found s=2.5 and t=24. Then, computed the time for s + 1/2 speed, which is 3 km/h, and so walking time is 3 hours, total time 3 hours + 24 minutes = 204 minutes.

Alternatively, I can just compute everything in hours.

Wait, perhaps I can cross-verify.

So, when she walks at 2.5 km/h, the walking time is 9 / 2.5 = 3.6 hours, which is 3 hours 36 minutes. So, total time is 4 hours, so t is 4 hours - 3.6 hours = 0.4 hours, which is 24 minutes. That matches.

When she walks at 2.5 + 2 = 4.5 km/h, the walking time is 9 / 4.5 = 2 hours. So, total time is 2 hours 24 minutes, which the problem states. So that's correct.

So, when she walks at 3 km/h, walking time is 3 hours, so total time is 3 + 24/60 = 3.4 hours, but the problem asks for the time in minutes, including t. So, 3 hours is 180 minutes, plus 24 minutes is 204 minutes.

Yes, that seems correct.

Therefore, the answer is 204 minutes.

To solve the problem, we first determine Aya's walking speed \( s \) and the time \( t \) she spends at the coffee shop. 

### Step 1: Set up the equations
Given:
1. When walking at \( s \) km/h, the total time is 4 hours (240 minutes), including \( t \) minutes at the coffee shop.
2. When walking at \( s + 2 \) km/h, the total time is 2 hours 24 minutes (144 minutes), including \( t \) minutes at the coffee shop.

The distance walked is 9 km in both cases.

#### Equation for the first scenario:
\[
9 = s \left(4 - \frac{t}{60}\right)
\]

#### Equation for the second scenario:
\[
9 = (s + 2) \left(2.4 - \frac{t}{60}\right)
\]

### Step 2: Solve for \( s \) and \( t \)
From the first equation:
\[
4 - \frac{t}{60} = \frac{9}{s}
\]

From the second equation:
\[
2.4 - \frac{t}{60} = \frac{9}{s + 2}
\]

Subtract the second equation from the first:
\[
1.6 = 9 \left(\frac{1}{s} - \frac{1}{s + 2}\right)
\]

Simplify:
\[
1.6 = \frac{18}{s(s + 2)}
\]

Solve for \( s \):
\[
s(s + 2) = \frac{18}{1.6} = 11.25
\]
\[
s^2 + 2s - 11.25 = 0
\]

Using the quadratic formula:
\[
s = \frac{-2 \pm \sqrt{4 + 45}}{2} = \frac{-2 \pm 7}{2}
\]
\[
s = 2.5 \, \text{km/h} \quad (\text{since speed cannot be negative})
\]

Substitute \( s = 2.5 \) into the first equation to find \( t \):
\[
4 - \frac{t}{60} = \frac{9}{2.5} = 3.6
\]
\[
\frac{t}{60} = 0.4 \implies t = 24 \, \text{minutes}
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the time at \( s + \frac{1}{2} \) km/h
When Aya walks at \( s + \frac{1}{2} = 3 \) km/h, the walking time is:
\[
\text{Walking time} = \frac{9}{3} = 3 \, \text{hours} = 180 \, \text{minutes}
\]

Including the coffee shop time:
\[
\text{Total time} = 180 + 24 = 204 \, \text{minutes}
\]

### Final Answer:
\[
\boxed{204}
\]
