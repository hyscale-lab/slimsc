Okay, so I have this math problem here, and I need to figure out the sum of the squares of all the items in the list. Let me read the problem again to make sure I understand all the conditions.

The list of positive integers has three properties:
1. The sum of all items is 30.
2. The unique mode is 9.
3. The median is a positive integer that doesn't appear in the list itself.

And I need to find the sum of the squares of all the items.

Hmm. Let's break this down step by step.

First, the sum is 30. So whatever numbers are in the list, when I add them up, it should total 30.

Second, the unique mode is 9. Mode is the number that appears most frequently in the list. So 9 has to appear more times than any other number. And since it's unique, no other number can have the same count as 9.

Third, the median is a positive integer that doesn't appear in the list. Wait, median is a position in the ordered list, right? So if the list has an odd number of elements, the median is the middle number. If even, it's the average of the two middle numbers. But in this case, the median is a positive integer, but it's not in the list. So, for example, if the median is 8, then 8 isn't in the list.

Alright, so let's think about how the list can be structured. Let me consider the number of elements first. Let's say there are n numbers in the list. The mode is 9, so 9 must appear at least twice, and more than any other number.

Wait, but 9 must appear more times than any other number. So if 9 appears twice, no other number can appear twice or more. If 9 appears three times, then others can appear at most two times.

Let me also think about the median. The median is not in the list, so depending on whether n is odd or even, the median might be an integer not present.

So, perhaps it's better to try different possible list lengths and see which one fits all conditions.

Let me start by considering the number of elements, n.

Case 1: n is odd.

Suppose n is 5. Then the median is the 3rd number. Since it's not present in the list, and the list is positive integers, let's see.

But wait, the sum is 30. Let me try to construct a list.

Wait, perhaps I should think about how the mode affects the list. Since 9 is the unique mode, it's the most frequent number. So, the number of 9s must be higher than any other number.

Let me consider the minimal number of 9s needed. To have a unique mode, 9 must appear at least twice. But if there are other numbers that also appear twice, then 9 wouldn't be the unique mode. So to make 9 the unique mode, it has to appear more times than any other number.

So, for example, if 9 appears three times, then other numbers can appear at most two times. If 9 appears four times, others can appear at most three times, but since 9 is the mode, others can't reach four.

Wait, but 9 needs to be the unique mode, so it should have a higher count than all others. So if another number appears k times, 9 must appear at least k+1 times.

So, the number of 9s must be more than the count of any other number.

Let me think about possible list structures.

Let me try to figure out the minimal number of 9s. Let's say the list has m 9s. So m must be greater than the count of any other number.

Now, the sum is 30, which is fixed.

Also, the median is a positive integer not in the list. So in the sorted list, the middle number is an integer not present.

Hmm.

Let me think of possible n.

Let me consider n=7. Then the median is the 4th number. So the 4th number is not in the list.

Wait, but the list is sorted, right? So, for example, if the list is [a, b, c, d, e, f, g], then d is the median. But d is not in the list, which is confusing because d is part of the list. Wait, no, the median is a value, but it's not in the list.

Wait, no. Wait, the median is a value, but it's not in the list. So, for example, if the list is [1,2,3,4,5], the median is 3, which is in the list. But in our case, the median is a positive integer not in the list. So, for example, if the list is [1,2,3,5,6], the median is (3+5)/2 = 4, which is not in the list.

Wait, but 4 is the median, but in the list [1,2,3,5,6], which is sorted, the median is 3, right? Because it's the middle element. So maybe I'm misunderstanding.

Wait, no, for n odd, the median is the middle element. So if the median is not present, that would mean that the middle element is not in the list. But that can't happen because the list is made of elements, so the middle element is part of the list. Therefore, perhaps the problem is referring to the case where the median is an integer, but it's not one of the elements in the list. Hmm, but for an odd number of elements, the median is the middle element, which is in the list. So that's a contradiction. Therefore, the median must be for an even number of elements.

Wait, wait, no. Let me clarify.

If n is odd, the median is the middle number, which is an element of the list. So the median can't be a positive integer not in the list. Therefore, n must be even for the median to be an average of two middle numbers, which might not be present in the list.

Wait, for example, if n=4, the median is the average of the 2nd and 3rd elements. But if those two are consecutive numbers, their average could be a non-integer, but in the problem statement, the median is a positive integer. So, for the median to be an integer, the two middle numbers must add up to an even number, so their average is integer. But the median is an integer not in the list.

So let's take an example: n=4.

Suppose the list is [a, b, c, d], sorted. The median is (b + c)/2. For this to be an integer, b + c must be even. Also, the median must be an integer not present in the list.

So, for example, if the list is [1, 3, 4, 5], the median is (3 +4)/2 = 3.5, which is not an integer. So that doesn't work.

Another example: [1, 2, 4, 5]. Median is (2 +4)/2 = 3, which is not in the list. So that's valid.

So for n=4, the median is 3, which is not in the list.

So in this case, the list could be [1,2,4,5], sum is 12, which is less than 30. So I need to adjust.

Wait, but the sum needs to be 30. So let's see.

So n=4, sum=30.

We have to have four numbers, the sum is 30, mode is 9, which appears more than any other number.

But wait, in a list of four numbers, how can 9 be the mode? Because to be the mode, 9 must appear more than any other number.

So, if the list is [9,9, x, y], sorted as [x, y, 9,9]. Then the two middle numbers are y and 9, so the median is (y +9)/2. For this to be an integer, y must be odd if 9 is odd, because their sum would be even. So y must be odd.

Also, the median is an integer not in the list.

So, let's try to see.

List: [a, b, 9,9], sorted. So a <= b <=9 <=9.

Sum is a + b +9 +9 =30 → a + b =12.

The median is (b +9)/2, which must be an integer and not in the list.

So (b +9) must be even, so b must be odd. Because 9 is odd, adding two odds gives even.

So b is odd, and a <= b <=9.

Also, the mode is 9, which appears twice. So other numbers can appear at most once. So a and b must be distinct, and a !=9, b !=9.

Wait, but in this case, since the list is [a, b, 9,9], a and b are the first two numbers, which are <=9.

But since 9 is the unique mode, a and b must be unique, because if a or b were equal to another number, that would create another mode or duplicate. Hmm, no, if a and b are the same, that would make mode 9 and a/b both modes. Since the mode is unique, 9 must appear more times than any other number.

Wait, in this case, 9 appears twice. So if a and b are the same, then that number appears twice as well, making it a mode as well. Therefore, a and b cannot be the same. So a != b.

So, a and b are distinct positive integers, a <= b <=9, a + b =12.

We need to find a and b such that:

1. a + b =12
2. a < b (since a <=b and they are distinct)
3. Both a and b are positive integers <=9.

Also, the median is (b +9)/2, which must be an integer not in the list.

So, let's list possible a and b pairs where a + b =12, a < b, a, b <=9.

Possible pairs:

a=3, b=9 → 3+9=12. But b=9 is equal to the third and fourth elements, which are 9. So the list would be [3,9,9,9]. Wait, no, wait:

Wait, no, in this case, the list is [a, b,9,9], so a and b are the first two elements. If a=3 and b=9, then the list would be [3,9,9,9]. Wait, but this is actually four elements? No, wait, no. Wait, n=4. So the first two elements are a and b, which are 3 and 9. Then the last two are 9 and 9. So the sorted list is [3,9,9,9], but that's four elements. Wait, but 9 appears three times, which is more than a=3, which appears once. So mode is 9, unique.

But the median is (b +9)/2 = (9+9)/2=9. But 9 is in the list, which violates the condition that the median is not in the list. So that doesn't work.

Next pair: a=4, b=8 → sum 12. So the list is [4,8,9,9]. Sum is 4+8+9+9=30. Good.

Median is (8+9)/2=8.5, which is not an integer. So that doesn't fit.

Wait, but the median must be an integer. So we need (b +9) even. So b must be odd because 9 is odd. So b must be odd.

Possible a and b where a + b=12, a < b, b is odd, and a,b <=9.

Let me see:

b=5 → a=7. But 7>5, which contradicts a <b. So no.

b=7 → a=5. So a=5, b=7. So the list is [5,7,9,9]. Sum is 5+7+9+9=30.

Median is (7+9)/2=8, which is an integer not present in the list. Perfect.

So the list would be [5,7,9,9]. Let me check all the conditions.

Sum: 5+7+9+9=30. Yes.

Mode: 9 appears twice, others appear once. So unique mode is 9. Correct.

Median: (7+9)/2=8, which is not in the list. Correct.

So that works. So the list is [5,7,9,9].

Now, the sum of squares is 5² +7² +9² +9² =25 +49 +81 +81.

Calculating that: 25+49=74; 81+81=162; 74+162=236.

Wait, 25 +49 is 74, plus 81 is 155, plus another 81 is 236. So sum is 236.

But wait, let me make sure if n=4 is the only possibility.

Wait, could there be a longer list that satisfies the conditions?

Let me try n=5. Then the median is the 3rd number, which must be an integer not in the list.

Wait, but in a list of 5 numbers, the median is the third number, which is present in the list. So it's impossible for the median to be an integer not in the list if n is odd. So n has to be even.

So, n=4 is the only possibility? Or maybe n=6?

Wait, n=6. Then the median is the average of the 3rd and 4th numbers. So for that to be an integer, the 3rd and 4th numbers must add up to an even number. So their sum is even.

Also, the median must not be present in the list.

So let's try n=6.

We need to have 6 numbers, sum 30, mode 9, which appears more than any other number.

So, let's think about how many 9s we need.

If 9 appears three times, then the other numbers can appear at most twice.

But if 9 appears four times, others can appear at most three times, but 9 is the unique mode.

Wait, let's try 9 appearing three times.

So, the list has three 9s, and the other three numbers are different, or maybe some appear twice.

Wait, but 9 is the mode, so no other number can appear three times.

So, if the list is [a, b, c, d,9,9,9], but wait, n=6. So sorted list is [a, b, c, d, e, f], with e and f being 9.

Wait, no, three 9s would mean that in the sorted list, the last three are 9,9,9.

So the list would be [a, b, c, d,9,9,9], but that's seven elements. Wait, no, n=6.

Wait, n=6, so the list has six elements, sorted as [a, b, c, d, e, f]. The median is (c +d)/2, which must be an integer not in the list.

So, let's have three 9s. Then, the last three elements are 9,9,9.

So, the list is [a, b, c, d,9,9,9], but that can't be for n=6. Hmm, maybe I should think again.

Wait, n=6, three 9s. So in the sorted list, positions 4,5,6 are 9. So the list is [a, b, c, 9,9,9]. Then, the median is (c +9)/2. This must be an integer not in the list.

So, (c +9) must be even, so c must be odd.

Also, the sum is a + b + c +9 +9 +9=30 → a + b + c=3.

Since a, b, c are positive integers, the minimum a can be is 1. So a=1, then b must be at least 1, but since a <=b <=c <=9, and a + b + c=3.

Possible combinations:

a=1, b=1, c=1. Then the list is [1,1,1,9,9,9].

Sum: 1+1+1+9+9+9=30. Correct.

Median: (1 +9)/2=5, which is not in the list. So that works.

Mode: 9 appears three times, 1 appears three times. Oh no, that's a problem. The mode would be both 1 and 9. Because they both appear three times. But the problem says the unique mode is 9. So this doesn't work.

So we need 9 to appear more than any other number. So in this case, 9 appears three times, so other numbers can appear at most two times.

Let me try a=1, b=1, c=1: but that gives three 1s, which conflicts.

So let me try a=1, b=1, c=1: no, same problem.

Wait, a=1, b=2, c=0: no, c can't be 0. Wait, a, b, c must be positive integers. So the minimal sum a + b + c=3.

Which only allows a=1, b=1, c=1.

So that doesn't work because it creates another mode.

So, perhaps 9 needs to appear four times in n=6.

So, four 9s. Then the sum contributed by 9s is 4*9=36. But the total sum is 30, which is less than 36. So that's impossible.

So, n=6 is not feasible with four 9s.

So, maybe 9 appears three times, but other numbers appear at most two times.

Wait, let's try a=1, b=1, c=1: but again, same problem.

Alternatively, a=1, b=1, c=1: no, same as before.

Wait, maybe a=1, b=2, c=0: no, can't have 0.

Hmm, seems like n=6 is not possible because the sum of a + b + c=3 with three positive integers can only be 1,1,1, which creates another mode.

So, perhaps n=4 is the only possible even number where the sum can be achieved without creating another mode.

Wait, but let me confirm if n=4 is the only possible case.

Wait, n=2: sum=30. The list would have two numbers, both 15. So the mode would be 15, but the median is (15+15)/2=15, which is in the list. So that doesn't satisfy the median condition.

n=3: median is the second number, which is in the list. So median can't be not in the list.

n=4: as above, possible.

n=5: median is in the list.

n=6: as above, problematic.

n=7: median is the fourth element, in the list.

n=8: median is average of 4th and 5th elements.

Wait, let me check n=8.

n=8: sum=30.

Mode is 9, which must appear more than any other number.

So, number of 9s must be at least four, because if other numbers can appear at most three times.

Wait, let's try 9 appearing four times.

So, 9*4=36. But 36>30, which is impossible. So 9 can't appear four times.

So 9 appears three times.

Then, other numbers can appear at most two times.

Sum contributed by 9s is 27. So remaining sum is 3.

We have five other numbers, which must sum to 3.

But five positive integers summing to 3: the minimal sum is 5 (each being 1). So 3 is less than 5. Impossible.

Therefore, n=8 is not possible.

So, the only possible n is 4.

So going back, the list [5,7,9,9] satisfies all conditions.

Wait, let me double-check.

Sum:5+7+9+9=30. Yes.

Mode:9 appears twice, others appear once. So unique mode is 9.

Median: (7+9)/2=8, which is not in the list. Correct.

So, the sum of squares is 5² +7² +9² +9²=25+49+81+81.

Calculating this: 25+49=74, 81+81=162; 74+162=236.

So the answer is 236.

To solve the problem, we need to construct a list of positive integers that satisfies the given conditions and then compute the sum of the squares of its elements.

### Conditions:
1. **Sum of the list**: The total of all elements is 30.
2. **Unique mode**: The number 9 appears more frequently than any other number.
3. **Median**: The median is an integer that does not appear in the list.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Determine the number of elements (n)**:
   - For the median to be an integer not in the list, the number of elements must be even. If n were odd, the median would be the middle element, which is in the list, violating the condition.
   - We test even values of n. Starting with n=4, n=6, etc., we find that n=4 works.

2. **Construct the list for n=4**:
   - The list must have four elements, with 9 as the unique mode. Thus, 9 must appear at least twice.
   - Let the sorted list be [a, b, 9, 9]. The median is (b + 9)/2, which must be an integer not in the list.
   - The sum of the list is a + b + 9 + 9 = 30 ⇒ a + b = 12.
   - To ensure the median is an integer, (b + 9) must be even, so b must be odd.
   - Possible pairs (a, b) that satisfy a + b = 12, a < b, and b is odd are (5, 7). Thus, the list is [5, 7, 9, 9].

3. **Verify the conditions**:
   - **Sum**: 5 + 7 + 9 + 9 = 30 ✔️
   - **Mode**: 9 appears twice, others appear once ✔️
   - **Median**: (7 + 9)/2 = 8, which is not in the list ✔️

4. **Compute the sum of squares**:
   - Sum of squares = 5² + 7² + 9² + 9² = 25 + 49 + 81 + 81 = 236.

### Final Answer:
The sum of the squares of all the items in the list is:

\boxed{236}
