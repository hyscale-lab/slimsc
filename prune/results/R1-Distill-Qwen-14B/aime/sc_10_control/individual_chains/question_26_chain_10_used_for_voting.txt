Okay, so I've got this geometry problem here, and I need to find the length of AP in the triangle ABC. The triangle is inscribed in a circle ω. The tangents at B and C intersect at D, and AD intersects ω again at P. The sides are given: AB is 5, BC is 9, and AC is 10. I need to find AP as a fraction m/n where m and n are coprime, and then give m + n.

Hmm, let me first try to visualize the problem. There's triangle ABC with sides 5, 9, 10. The circle ω is the circumcircle of ABC. Tangents at B and C meet at D, so D is the ex-pole or something related to the circle. Then, connecting A to D, this line intersects ω again at P, and I need to find AP.

I remember that when you have tangents from a point to a circle, the lengths are equal. So, DB and DC should be equal because they're both tangents from D to ω. So, triangle DBC is isoceles with DB = DC.

But I don't know where exactly D is located. Maybe I can find some properties about D and then use that to find AP.

Wait, maybe using power of a point could help here. Since D is outside the circle ω, and DB and DC are tangents, the power of D with respect to ω is DB² = DC² = DA * DP. That seems useful. So, if I can find DB, I can relate it to DA and DP.

But I don't know DA yet. Alternatively, maybe I can express DA in terms of AP and DP, since AP is part of AD. Let me denote AP as x and DP as y. Then, AD = AP + DP = x + y. But since AD is a secant, the power of D would be DA * DP = DB². So, (x + y) * y = DB².

But I don't know DB yet. Maybe I can find DB in terms of the sides of the triangle. Alternatively, perhaps I can compute the circumradius of triangle ABC and then find DB.

Wait, the triangle ABC has sides 5, 9, 10. Let me confirm if it's a valid triangle. 5 + 9 > 10 (14>10, yes), 5 + 10 >9 (15>9, yes), 9 +10>5 (19>5, yes). So, it's a valid triangle. Let me compute some properties of triangle ABC.

First, maybe compute its area using Heron's formula. The semi-perimeter s = (5 + 9 + 10)/2 = (24)/2 =12.

Area = sqrt[s(s - a)(s - b)(s - c)] = sqrt[12*(12-5)(12-9)(12-10)] = sqrt[12*7*3*2] = sqrt[504] = sqrt[16*31.5] = 4*sqrt(31.5). Wait, 504 is 16*31.5? Wait, 16*31 is 496, 16*31.5 is 504. So, sqrt(504) is sqrt(16*31.5) = 4*sqrt(31.5). But 31.5 is 63/2, so sqrt(63/2) = (3*sqrt(14))/sqrt(2) = (3*sqrt(28))/2? Wait, maybe it's better to write it as sqrt(504) = sqrt(16*31.5) = 4*sqrt(31.5). Alternatively, maybe 504 factors into 16*31.5, but that's not the most simplified. Let me check:

504 = 16 * 31.5? Wait, 16 * 31 is 496, 16*31.5=504. Hmm. Alternatively, 504 = 4*126 = 4*9*14 = 36*14. So, sqrt(504) = 6*sqrt(14). Yeah, that makes sense because 36*14=504. So, area is 6*sqrt(14).

Alright, so area is 6√14. Now, the circumradius R of triangle ABC can be found using the formula:

R = (a*b*c)/(4*Δ) = (5*9*10)/(4*6√14) = (450)/(24√14) = (75)/(4√14). Let me rationalize the denominator:

75/(4√14) = (75√14)/(4*14) = (75√14)/56. So, R = 75√14 /56.

Wait, but I need to confirm if that's correct. The formula is R = (a b c)/(4 Δ). So, a=5, b=9, c=10, Δ=6√14.

So, a*b*c = 5*9*10 = 450. 4Δ = 4*6√14 = 24√14.

So, R = 450 / (24√14) = (450)/(24√14). Simplify numerator and denominator:

450 ÷ 6 =75; 24 ÷6=4.

So, 75/(4√14). Then, rationalize:

75√14 / (4*14) = 75√14 /56. Yes, so R is 75√14 /56.

Now, the length of the tangent from D to ω is DB = DC. The tangent length from D to ω is equal to sqrt(DO² - R²), where DO is the distance from D to the center O.

But I don't know where D is. Alternatively, perhaps I can find DB in another way.

Wait, since D is the intersection of the two tangents at B and C, D lies on the symmedian of triangle ABC. Alternatively, D is the exsymmedian point or something similar.

Alternatively, maybe it's better to use coordinates. Assign coordinates to the triangle and compute everything numerically.

Let me try that approach. Let me place point C at the origin (0,0), point A at (10,0), since AC is 10. Then, point B is somewhere in the plane. Let me compute the coordinates of B.

Given that AB=5, BC=9, and AC=10. Coordinates:

C is (0,0), A is (10,0). Let B be (x,y). Then, distance from A to B is 5:

sqrt[(x-10)^2 + y^2] =5 => (x-10)^2 + y^2=25.

Distance from B to C is 9: sqrt[x^2 + y^2] =9 => x² + y²=81.

So, subtract the two equations:

(x² + y²) - [(x-10)^2 + y^2] =81 -25 => x² - (x² -20x +100) =56 => 20x -100=56 => 20x=156 => x=7.8.

So, x=7.8=39/5. Then, plug back into x² + y²=81:

(39/5)^2 + y²=81. Compute 39/5 squared: 39²=1521, 1521/25=60.84. So, 60.84 + y²=81 => y²=20.16. So y= sqrt(20.16). Let me compute 20.16 as 2016/100=504/25.

So, y= sqrt(504/25) = (sqrt(504))/5. We know that 504=16*31.5, but earlier we saw that 504=36*14, so sqrt(504)=6*sqrt(14). So, y=6√14 /5.

So, point B is at (39/5, 6√14/5). So, coordinates:

A: (10,0)
B: (39/5, 6√14/5)
C: (0,0)

Now, I need to find the tangents from B and C to the circumcircle ω. Wait, but the tangents at B and C are already known. Because the tangent at a point on a circle is perpendicular to the radius at that point.

So, to find the tangent at point B, I need the slope of OB, where O is the circumcenter of ABC. Wait, I can compute O's coordinates.

Circumcenter O is the intersection of the perpendicular bisectors of AB and AC.

First, find the midpoint of AB: A is (10,0), B is (39/5,6√14/5). Midpoint M1:

x: (10 + 39/5)/2 = (50/5 +39/5)/2= (89/5)/2=89/10=8.9

y: (0 +6√14/5)/2= (6√14/5)/2=3√14/5.

The slope of AB is [ (6√14/5 -0) / (39/5 -10) ] = [6√14/5] / [ (39 -50)/5 ] = [6√14/5]/(-11/5) = -6√14/11.

So, the perpendicular bisector of AB will have slope reciprocal and opposite: 11/(6√14). So, equation of perpendicular bisector through M1 (89/10, 3√14/5):

y - 3√14/5 = (11)/(6√14)(x - 89/10)

Similarly, find the perpendicular bisector of AC. Midpoint of AC is (5,0). Slope of AC is (0-0)/(0-10)=0, so it's horizontal. So, perpendicular bisector is vertical, x=5.

So, the perpendicular bisector of AC is x=5. Now, find the intersection point O of x=5 and the perpendicular bisector of AB.

Plug x=5 into the equation of the perpendicular bisector of AB:

y - 3√14/5 = (11)/(6√14)(5 - 89/10)

Compute 5 as 50/10, so 50/10 -89/10 = (-39/10). So,

y = 3√14/5 + (11)/(6√14)*(-39/10)

Compute (11 * (-39))/(6√14 *10) = (-429)/(60√14) = (-143)/(20√14)

So, y = 3√14/5 - 143/(20√14)

To combine these, let me rationalize the second term:

143/(20√14) = (143√14)/(20*14) = (143√14)/280

So, y = (3√14/5) - (143√14)/280.

Convert 3√14/5 to 168√14/280:

3/5 = 168/280, so 3√14/5=168√14/280.

So, y=168√14/280 -143√14/280 =25√14/280 =5√14/56.

So, the circumcenter O is at (5,5√14/56).

Wait, that's interesting. So O is (5, 5√14/56).

Now, the tangent at B to ω: since the tangent is perpendicular to the radius OB. So, the slope of OB is [ (5√14/56 -6√14/5) / (5 -39/5) ]

Compute denominator: 5 is 25/5, so 25/5 -39/5= (-14/5). Numerator: 5√14/56 -6√14/5 = (25√14 - 336√14)/280= (-311√14)/280.

So, slope of OB is [ (-311√14/280) ] / (-14/5) )= [ (-311√14/280) ] * (-5/14)= (311√14 *5)/(280*14) )= (1555√14)/(3920).

Simplify numerator and denominator: Let's see if 1555 and 3920 have a common factor. 1555 ÷5=311, 3920 ÷5=784. So, 311 and 784. 311 is a prime number? Let me check: 311 divided by primes up to sqrt(311)~17.6. 311 ÷2 no, ÷3 no, ÷5 no, ÷7 (311/7≈44.428), ÷11 (28.27), ÷13 (23.92), ÷17 (18.29). So yes, 311 is prime. So, slope is (311√14)/(784).

Thus, the tangent at B has slope perpendicular to OB, which is negative reciprocal: -784/(311√14). Let me rationalize that: -784√14/(311*14)= -56√14/311.

So, the tangent at B is a line with slope -56√14/311 passing through point B (39/5,6√14/5).

Similarly, the tangent at C is a different line. Wait, point C is (0,0), and the tangent at C is perpendicular to OC. The slope of OC is [5√14/56 -0]/[5 -0]= (5√14/56)/5=√14/56.

So, the tangent at C has slope perpendicular to OC, which is -56/√14= -56√14/14= -4√14.

So, the tangent at C is a line with slope -4√14 passing through (0,0).

So, the equation of tangent at C is y = -4√14 x.

Now, to find point D, which is the intersection of the two tangents: tangent at B and tangent at C.

Equation of tangent at B: Let me write it down. Point-slope form: y - 6√14/5 = (-56√14/311)(x - 39/5).

Equation of tangent at C: y = -4√14 x.

So, let's substitute y from tangent C into tangent B's equation.

So, y = -4√14 x.

Plug into tangent B:

-4√14 x -6√14/5 = (-56√14/311)(x -39/5).

Let's multiply both sides by 311 to eliminate denominators:

-4√14 x *311 -6√14/5 *311 = -56√14(x -39/5).

Let me compute each term:

First term: -4√14 *311 x = -1244√14 x.

Second term: -6√14 *311 /5 = (-1866√14)/5.

Right side: -56√14 x + (56√14 *39)/5.

So, equation becomes:

-1244√14 x - (1866√14)/5 = -56√14 x + (2184√14)/5.

Bring all terms to left side:

-1244√14 x +56√14 x - (1866√14)/5 -2184√14/5 =0.

Combine like terms:

(-1244 +56)√14 x - (1866 +2184)√14 /5=0.

-1188√14 x -4050√14 /5=0.

Simplify:

-1188√14 x -810√14=0.

Factor out -√14:

-√14(1188x +810)=0.

Since -√14≠0, so 1188x +810=0.

Solve for x:

x= -810 /1188= simplify numerator and denominator by dividing by 6: -135/198. Again divide by 9: -15/22.

So, x= -15/22.

Then, y= -4√14 x= -4√14*(-15/22)=60√14/22=30√14/11.

So, point D is at (-15/22, 30√14/11).

Now, we have point D at (-15/22, 30√14/11) and point A at (10,0). We need to find the equation of line AD.

Compute the slope of AD:

m=(30√14/11 -0)/(-15/22 -10)= (30√14/11)/( (-15/22 -220/22) )= (30√14/11)/(-235/22)= (30√14/11)*( -22/235 )= (-60√14)/235= (-12√14)/47.

So, the slope is -12√14/47.

Equation of AD: point-slope from A(10,0):

y -0 = (-12√14/47)(x -10).

So, y= (-12√14/47)x + 120√14/47.

Now, this line intersects the circumcircle ω again at point P. We need to find point P.

We have the equation of the circumcircle ω. Since O is at (5,5√14/56) and R is 75√14/56.

The equation of ω is (x -5)^2 + (y -5√14/56)^2 = (75√14/56)^2.

So, let's write the equation of AD and substitute into ω's equation.

Equation of AD: y= (-12√14/47)x +120√14/47.

Substitute into ω:

(x -5)^2 + [ (-12√14/47 x +120√14/47 -5√14/56 ) ]^2 = (75√14/56)^2.

This seems complicated, but let's compute step by step.

First, compute the y-component:

y = (-12√14/47)x +120√14/47.

So, y -5√14/56 = (-12√14/47)x +120√14/47 -5√14/56.

Factor out √14:

=√14 [ (-12/47)x +120/47 -5/56 ].

Let me compute the constants:

120/47 -5/56.

Find a common denominator, which is 47*56=2632.

120/47= (120*56)/2632=6720/2632.

5/56= (5*47)/2632=235/2632.

So, 6720/2632 -235/2632=6485/2632.

So, y -5√14/56=√14 [ (-12/47)x +6485/2632 ].

Let me write it as:

=√14 [ (-12/47 x ) +6485/2632 ]

Now, let's square this term:

[√14 ( -12/47 x + 6485/2632 )]^2 =14*( (-12/47 x +6485/2632 )^2.

So, the y-component squared is 14*( ( -12/47 x +6485/2632 )^2.

Now, let's write the entire equation:

(x -5)^2 +14*( (-12/47 x +6485/2632 )^2 = (75√14/56)^2.

Compute (75√14/56)^2= (75^2 *14)/56²= (5625 *14)/3136=78750/3136.

Simplify: 78750 ÷ 2=39375, 3136 ÷2=1568. 39375 and 1568 have no common factors? 39375 ÷5=7875, 1568 ÷5=313.6, not integer. So, 78750/3136 is as simplified.

So, equation becomes:

(x -5)^2 +14*( (-12/47 x +6485/2632 )^2 =78750/3136.

This looks messy, but let's try to compute each term step by step.

First, compute (x -5)^2= x² -10x +25.

Second, compute (-12/47 x +6485/2632)^2.

Let me denote A=-12/47 x, B=6485/2632.

So, (A + B)^2= A² + 2AB + B².

Compute A²= (144/2209)x².

2AB=2*(-12/47 x)(6485/2632)= 2*(-12*6485)/(47*2632)x.

Compute numerator: -12*6485= Let's compute 12*6485=77,820, so -77,820.

Denominator:47*2632=47*(2600 +32)=47*2600=122,200; 47*32=1,504. So total 122,200 +1,504=123,704.

So, 2AB= (-77,820)/(123,704) x. Simplify:

Divide numerator and denominator by 4: -19,455/30,926 x.

Wait, 77,820 ÷4=19,455; 123,704 ÷4=30,926.

Wait, 30,926 and 19,455. Let me see if they have a common factor. 19,455 ÷5=3,891. 30,926 ÷5=6,185.2, not integer. 19,455 ÷3=6,485. 30,926 ÷3=10,308.666, no. So, 19,455/30,926 is the simplified form.

So, 2AB= (-19,455/30,926 )x.

Now, B²=(6485/2632)^2. Let's compute that.

6485²: Let's compute 6485*6485. Hmm, this is a bit tedious. Alternatively, perhaps I can note that 6485=5*1297, and 2632=8*329=8*7*47. So, 6485/2632=5*1297/(8*7*47). Hmm, perhaps no simplification.

Alternatively, perhaps I can write 6485²= (6000 +485)^2=6000² +2*6000*485 +485²=36,000,000 +5,820,000 +235,225=42,055,225.

And 2632²: 2632=2632. Let me compute 2632²:

Compute (2600 +32)^2=2600² +2*2600*32 +32²=6,760,000 +166,400 +1,024=6,927,424.

So, B²=42,055,225 /6,927,424.

So, putting it all together:

(-12/47 x +6485/2632 )^2= (144/2209)x² + (-19,455/30,926)x +42,055,225 /6,927,424.

So, the second term in the equation is 14*(144/2209 x² -19,455/30,926 x +42,055,225 /6,927,424 )

Multiply each term by 14:

14*(144/2209 x²)=2016/2209 x².

14*(-19,455/30,926 x)= (-272,370)/30,926 x. Simplify: Divide numerator and denominator by 2: -136,185/15,463 x.

14*(42,055,225 /6,927,424 )=588,773,150 /6,927,424. Let me divide numerator and denominator by 2:294,386,575 /3,463,712.

So, putting it all together, the second term is:

2016/2209 x² -136,185/15,463 x +294,386,575 /3,463,712.

Now, the entire equation:

(x² -10x +25) + (2016/2209 x² -136,185/15,463 x +294,386,575 /3,463,712 )=78750/3136.

Multiply all terms by the least common multiple of denominators to eliminate fractions. That's going to be a huge number. Maybe 2209 *15,463 *3,463,712. That's too big. Maybe instead, let's move all terms to left side:

(x² -10x +25) + (2016/2209 x² -136,185/15,463 x +294,386,575 /3,463,712 ) -78750/3136=0.

This seems unwieldy. Maybe I can instead parametrize the line AD and find the other intersection point P.

Alternatively, since A is on ω, and AD intersects ω again at P, perhaps using parametric equations could help.

Parametrize AD: Let t be a parameter, with t=0 at A(10,0) and t=1 at D(-15/22,30√14 /11).

Wait, actually, no. A is (10,0), D is (-15/22, 30√14 /11). So, the vector from A to D is D - A: (-15/22 -10, 30√14/11 -0)= (-235/22, 30√14/11).

Parametric equations:

x=10 + (-235/22)t

y=0 + (30√14/11)t

We can plug this into the equation of ω and solve for t.

Equation of ω: (x -5)^2 + (y -5√14/56)^2 = (75√14/56)^2.

Substitute x and y:

[10 -5 + (-235/22)t]^2 + [ (30√14/11 t) -5√14/56 ]^2 = (75√14/56)^2.

Simplify:

[5 - (235/22)t]^2 + [ (30√14/11 t -5√14/56 ) ]^2 = (75√14/56)^2.

Compute each term.

First term: [5 - (235/22)t]^2.

=25 - 2*5*(235/22)t + (235/22)^2 t².

=25 - (2350/22)t + (55225/484)t².

=25 - (1175/11)t + (55225/484)t².

Second term: [ (30√14/11 t -5√14/56 ) ]^2.

Factor out √14:

=14*(30/11 t -5/56 )^2.

Compute inside the square:

=14*( (30/11 t -5/56 )^2 )

=14*( ( (30*56 t -5*11)/(11*56) )^2 )

Compute numerator: 30*56=1680 t, 5*11=55. So,

=14*( (1680 t -55)/(616) )^2.

=14*( (1680t -55)^2 )/(616)^2.

=14*( (1680t -55)^2 )/(379,456).

Now, expand (1680t -55)^2:

= (1680t)^2 -2*1680t*55 +55²

=2,822,400 t² -184,800 t +3,025.

So, the second term becomes:

14*(2,822,400 t² -184,800 t +3,025)/379,456.

= (39,513,600 t² -2,587,200 t +42,350)/379,456.

Simplify each term:

39,513,600 /379,456 = approx 104.08, but exact division:

39,513,600 ÷ 379,456: Let's see, 379,456 *104= 379,456*100=37,945,600; 379,456*4=1,517,824. Total 37,945,600 +1,517,824=39,463,424. Which is less than 39,513,600 by 50,176.

50,176 ÷379,456 = 0.132 approx. Hmm, perhaps not an integer. Maybe it's better to keep as fractions.

Wait, alternatively, note that 14*(a² +b² +c)/d², but perhaps I can find a better way.

Wait, maybe instead of parametrizing with t, I can use the fact that AP * AD = something. Wait, no, power of a point says that DA * DP = DB².

Wait, earlier I thought of that. So, if I can compute DA and DB, then I can find DP, and since AP = AD - DP, I can find AP.

But I need to compute DA. DA is the distance from D to A.

Point D is (-15/22,30√14 /11), Point A is (10,0).

Compute DA:

√[ (10 - (-15/22))² + (0 -30√14/11 )² ]

= √[ ( (220 +15)/22 )² + ( -30√14/11 )² ]

=√[ (235/22 )² + (900*14)/121 ]

Compute each term:

(235/22)^2 = (235^2)/(22^2)=55,225/484.

(900*14)/121=12,600/121.

So, DA=√[55,225/484 +12,600/121 ].

Convert to common denominator:

55,225/484 and 12,600/121= (12,600 *4)/484=50,400/484.

So, sum is (55,225 +50,400)/484=105,625/484.

So, DA=√(105,625/484 )=√(105,625)/√484= 325/22.

So, DA=325/22.

Now, DB is the length of the tangent from D to ω, which is equal to DB=DC.

Wait, but since D is the intersection of the two tangents, DB=DC, and the power of D is DB²=DA * DP.

So, DB² = DA * DP.

We have DA=325/22, and DP=?

Let me compute DB.

Wait, point D is (-15/22,30√14/11), point B is (39/5,6√14/5).

Compute the distance DB:

√[ (39/5 - (-15/22))² + (6√14/5 -30√14/11 )² ]

Compute each component:

x-coordinate: 39/5 +15/22= (39*22 +15*5)/110= (858 +75)/110=933/110.

y-coordinate:6√14/5 -30√14/11= (66√14 -150√14)/55= (-84√14)/55.

So, distance DB:

√[ (933/110)^2 + ( (-84√14)/55 )^2 ]

Compute each term:

(933/110)^2= (933)^2 / (110)^2= 870,489 /12,100.

( (-84√14)/55 )^2= (7056 *14)/3025=98,784 /3025.

Convert both terms to have denominator 30,3025 (which is 12,100 *25? Wait, 12,100 *25=302,500. Hmm, perhaps better to find a common denominator.

But wait, 933²=870,489, and 84²=7056.

So, compute numerator:

870,489 /12,100 +98,784 /3025.

Find common denominator: 3025 is 55²=3025, 12,100=121*100= (11²)*(10²). So, LCM of 3025 and 12,100 is 12,100.

Convert 98,784/3025 to denominator 12,100: multiply numerator and denominator by 4: 98,784*4=395,136; 3025*4=12,100.

So, 870,489/12,100 +395,136/12,100= (870,489 +395,136)/12,100=1,265,625/12,100.

Simplify 1,265,625/12,100: divide numerator and denominator by 25: 50,625/484.

So, DB²=50,625/484.

So, DA * DP = DB²=50,625/484.

We have DA=325/22, so DP= (50,625/484)/(325/22)= (50,625/484)*(22/325)= (50,625*22)/(484*325).

Simplify:

50,625 ÷25=2,025; 484 ÷4=121; 22 ÷11=2; 325 ÷25=13.

Wait, let me compute numerator and denominator:

Numerator:50,625 *22= 50,625*20 +50,625*2=1,012,500 +101,250=1,113,750.

Denominator:484 *325=484*300 +484*25=145,200 +12,100=157,300.

So, DP=1,113,750 /157,300.

Simplify:

Divide numerator and denominator by 50: numerator=22,275; denominator=3,146.

Check if 22,275 and 3,146 have common factors.

3,146 ÷2=1,573. 22,275 ÷2=11,137.5, not integer.

Check 3,146 ÷3=1,048.666, nope.

3,146 ÷7=449.428, nope.

3,146 ÷11=286, which is exact because 11*286=3,146.

So, 3,146=11*286. 286=2*11*13. So, 3,146=2*11²*13.

22,275 ÷11=2,025. So, 22,275=11*2,025.

So, DP=(11*2,025)/(11*286)=2,025/286.

Check if 2,025 and 286 have common factors. 286=2*11*13.

2,025 ÷5=405, so 2,025=5²*81=5²*3⁴.

So, no common factors. So, DP=2,025/286.

Therefore, AP=AD - DP=325/22 -2,025/286.

Convert to common denominator: 286=13*22. So, 325/22= (325*13)/286=4,225/286.

So, AP=4,225/286 -2,025/286= (4,225 -2,025)/286=2,200/286.

Simplify 2,200 ÷2=1,100; 286 ÷2=143.

So, 1,100/143. Check if reducible: 143=11*13. 1,100 ÷11=100. So, 1,100/143=100/13.

So, AP=100/13.

Therefore, m=100, n=13. They are coprime. So, m +n=113.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To solve the problem, we start by noting that triangle \(ABC\) has sides \(AB = 5\), \(BC = 9\), and \(AC = 10\). Using Heron's formula, the semi-perimeter \(s = \frac{5 + 9 + 10}{2} = 12\), and the area \(\Delta = \sqrt{12 \times 7 \times 3 \times 2} = 6\sqrt{14}\). The circumradius \(R\) of triangle \(ABC\) is calculated as \(R = \frac{abc}{4\Delta} = \frac{75\sqrt{14}}{56}\).

Next, we place the triangle in a coordinate system with \(C\) at the origin \((0,0)\), \(A\) at \((10,0)\), and \(B\) at \((\frac{39}{5}, \frac{6\sqrt{14}}{5})\). The circumcenter \(O\) is found to be at \((5, \frac{5\sqrt{14}}{56})\).

The tangents at \(B\) and \(C\) intersect at point \(D\). Using the equations of these tangents, we determine \(D\) to be at \((- \frac{15}{22}, \frac{30\sqrt{14}}{11})\). The line \(AD\) intersects the circumcircle again at point \(P\).

Using the power of a point theorem, we know \(DB^2 = DA \times DP\). Calculating \(DA = \frac{325}{22}\) and \(DB = \sqrt{\frac{50625}{484}} = \frac{225}{22}\), we find \(DP = \frac{2025}{286}\). Thus, \(AP = DA - DP = \frac{325}{22} - \frac{2025}{286} = \frac{100}{13}\).

Therefore, \(AP = \frac{100}{13}\), and \(m + n = 100 + 13 = 113\).

\boxed{113}
