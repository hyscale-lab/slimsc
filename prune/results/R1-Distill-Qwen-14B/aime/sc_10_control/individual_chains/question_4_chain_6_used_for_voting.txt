Okay, so I have this problem where Alice and Bob are playing a game with a stack of n tokens. They take turns removing either 1 or 4 tokens. Alice goes first, and the person who takes the last token wins. I need to find how many positive integers n ≤ 2024 allow Bob to have a winning strategy, no matter how Alice plays.

Hmm, let's think about how these games work. It sounds like a variation of the Nim game, but with specific move options. So, I should model this as a combinatorial game where each player can remove 1 or 4 tokens each turn.

The key here is to determine for each n whether the starting player (Alice) can force a win, or if the second player (Bob) can. So, I need to figure out the losing and winning positions.

In game theory, a position is a losing position if the player whose turn it is cannot force a win, assuming both players play optimally. Conversely, a winning position is one where the current player can force a win.

Let's denote the positions as either Winning (W) or Losing (L). The base case is when n=0, which is a losing position because the player can't make a move. But wait, in this problem, the player who takes the last token wins. So, if n=0, the previous player has already taken the last token and won. So, maybe the base case is n=0 is a losing position for the current player.

Wait, let me think. If n=0, the current player can't move, so they lose. So yes, n=0 is an L position.

Now, for n=1: Alice can take 1 token and win. So n=1 is a W position.

n=2: Alice can take 1, leaving 1 for Bob. Bob then takes 1 and wins. So wait, if Alice takes 1, Bob takes the last one and wins. Alternatively, can Alice take 4 from n=2? No, because there are only 2 tokens. So she can only take 1, leaving n=1 for Bob, who can then take it and win. So n=2 is a W position for Bob? Wait, no, because Alice is the one who starts, so if n=2 is a W for Alice or Bob?

Wait, I'm getting confused. Let's try to structure it more clearly.

Let me create a table for small n and mark them as W or L.

n=0: L (current player can't move, so loses)
n=1: current player takes 1 and wins. So W.
n=2: current player can take 1, leaving 1 for the opponent. The opponent takes 1 and wins. So n=2 is L? Because whatever the current player does, the opponent can win. Wait, no, because if n=2, current player can take 1, leaving 1, which is a W for the opponent. So current player is forced to leave opponent in a W position, meaning current player is in L. So n=2 is L.

Wait, but is that correct? Let's see. For n=2, you can take 1, leaving 1, which is a W for the opponent. So yes, n=2 is L.

n=3: The current player can take 1, leaving 2, which is L for the opponent. Because if you leave opponent in L, then you can win. So n=3 is W.

n=4: The current player can take 4 tokens and win. Alternatively, take 1, leaving 3 for the opponent. Wait, n=3 is W, so opponent can win from there. But the current player can choose to take all 4 and win immediately. So n=4 is W.

n=5: Current player can take 1, leaving 4, which is W for the opponent. Or take 4, leaving 1, which is W for the opponent. So no matter what current player does, opponent can win. So n=5 is L.

Wait, is that right? Let me check. If n=5, current player takes 1, leaving 4 (W) for opponent, who can then take 4 and win. If current player takes 4, leaving 1 (W) for opponent, who takes 1 and wins. So yes, n=5 is L.

n=6: Current player can take 1, leaving 5 (L) for opponent. So opponent is in a losing position. So n=6 is W.

n=7: Current player takes 1, leaving 6 (W) for opponent. Or takes 4, leaving 3 (W). So opponent can win either way? Wait, no. Wait, if current player takes 1, opponent is at 6 (W) and can win. If current player takes 4, opponent is at 3 (W) and can win. So no matter what, opponent can win. So n=7 is L.

Wait, that can't be right. Let's think again. n=7: if current player takes 1, leaving 6, which is W for opponent. Opponent can take 1, leaving 5 (L) for current player. So current player is in a bad spot. Alternatively, if current player takes 4, leaving 3 (W), opponent takes 1, leaving 2 (L). So in both cases, current player is forced into L. So yes, n=7 is L.

n=8: Current player can take 1, leaving 7 (L) for opponent. So opponent is in L, which means current player can win. So n=8 is W.

n=9: Current player can take 1, leaving 8 (W) for opponent, or take 4, leaving 5 (L) for opponent. So if current player takes 4, leaving 5 (L), opponent is in losing position. So current player can force a win. So n=9 is W.

Wait, let me double-check n=9. If current player takes 4, leaving 5, which is L. So opponent can't win from there. So yes, n=9 is W.

n=10: Current player can take 1, leaving 9 (W), or take 4, leaving 6 (W). So opponent is in W position either way. So n=10 is L.

Hmm, I'm seeing a pattern here. Let's list the positions:

n : 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16...
W/L: L W L W W L W L W W L W L W W L W...

Wait, let me write it out step by step:

n=0: L
n=1: W
n=2: L
n=3: W
n=4: W
n=5: L
n=6: W
n=7: L
n=8: W
n=9: W
n=10: L
n=11: W
n=12: L
n=13: W
n=14: W
n=15: L
n=16: W
...

Looking at this, the losing positions (L) seem to be at n=0,2,5,7,10,12,15,17,...

What's the pattern here? Let's see the differences between consecutive losing positions:

From 0 to 2: +2
2 to 5: +3
5 to 7: +2
7 to 10: +3
10 to12: +2
12 to15: +3
15 to17: +2

Hmm, alternates between adding 2 and 3. So the losing positions are every 2, then 3, then 2, then 3, etc. So the losing positions are numbers congruent to 0,2,5,7,10,12,15,17 mod 5? Wait, let's check:

Wait, 0 mod 5 is 0.

2 mod 5 is 2.

5 mod 5 is 0.

7 mod 5 is 2.

10 mod 5 is 0.

12 mod 5 is 2.

15 mod 5 is 0.

17 mod 5 is 2.

Wait, that's 0,2,0,2,0,2,0,2,... So the losing positions are numbers congruent to 0 or 2 mod 5? Wait, no, because 5 mod 5 is 0, and 7 mod 5 is 2. So 0 mod 5 and 2 mod 5.

Wait, let me check n=17: 17 mod 5 is 2. So yes, it's 2 mod 5. So the losing positions are numbers where n ≡ 0 or 2 mod 5.

Wait, let's check n=10: 10 mod5 is 0, which is L.

n=12: 12 mod5 is 2, which is L.

n=15: 0 mod5, L.

n=17: 2 mod5, L.

Yes, this seems to fit. So the losing positions are numbers where n ≡ 0 or 2 mod5.

So, if n ≡0 or 2 mod5, then the current player cannot force a win, assuming the opponent plays optimally. So for those n, the second player can win.

Wait, but let me confirm for n=5: 5 mod5=0, so L. Correct.

n=7: 7 mod5=2, L. Correct.

n=10: 0 mod5, L. Correct.

So, the losing positions are n ≡0 or 2 mod5.

So, the number of such n ≤2024 is the number of integers n ≤2024 where n ≡0 or2 mod5.

So, how many numbers ≤2024 are congruent to 0 mod5 or 2 mod5?

Let's compute them separately.

Numbers ≡0 mod5: floor(2024/5) +1 if 2024 is divisible by5.

2024 ÷5=404.8, so 404 numbers (since 5×404=2020, then 2020+5=2025>2024). So 404 numbers.

Numbers ≡2 mod5: Let's see. The first number is 2, then 7,12,..., up to the largest ≤2024.

The sequence is 2,7,12,..., up to ≤2024.

The general term is 5k +2. So, find k such that 5k+2 ≤2024 → 5k ≤2022 →k≤2022/5=404.4. So k can be from 0 to404, giving 405 numbers.

Wait, wait. Let me check for k=0: 5×0 +2=2, which is ≤2024.

k=404: 5×404 +2=2020+2=2022, which is ≤2024.

So the number of terms is 405.

So total numbers where n≡0 or2 mod5 is 404 +405=809.

Wait, but let me check: 2024 divided by5 is 404.8. So numbers ≡0 mod5: 404 numbers (5×1,5×2,...,5×404=2020).

Numbers ≡2 mod5: starts at 2, ends at 2022 (since 2022=5×404 +2). The number of terms is (2022 -2)/5 +1= (2020)/5 +1=404 +1=405.

So total is 404+405=809.

Wait, but let me confirm this. Let's think of it as each cycle of 5 numbers has two losing positions: 0 and2. So, in each 5 numbers, there are 2 losing positions.

So for 2024 numbers, how many full cycles of 5 are there?

2024 ÷5=404 full cycles, with a remainder of4.

Each full cycle contributes 2 losing positions, so 404×2=808.

Now, the remaining 4 numbers: 2021,2022,2023,2024.

Check which of these are ≡0 or2 mod5.

2021 mod5: 2021-5×404=2021-2020=1→1 mod5.

2022 mod5=2.

2023 mod5=3.

2024 mod5=4.

So in the remaining 4, only 2022 is ≡2 mod5. So add 1 more.

So total is 404×2 +1=808+1=809.

Yes, that matches.

So the number of losing positions is 809.

But wait, the problem says "the number of positive integers n less than or equal to 2024 for which there exists a strategy for Bob that guarantees that Bob will win the game regardless of Alice's play."

So, for n in these losing positions, Bob can win. Because if Alice starts at a losing position, then Bob can always respond to bring it back to a losing position for Alice.

So, the answer is 809.

Wait, but let me confirm again. Because earlier, when I constructed the W and L positions, the losing positions were n=0,2,5,7,10,12,15,17,... which are 0,2 mod5. So, n≡0 or2 mod5.

But wait, let me make sure. For n=5, which is 0 mod5: is it a losing position? Let's see. If n=5, Alice can take 1, leaving 4 (W), from which Bob can take 4 and win. Alternatively, Alice can take4, leaving 1 (W), from which Bob takes1 and wins. So yes, n=5 is a losing position.

Similarly, n=2: Alice takes1, leaving1 for Bob who wins. Or Alice can't take4. So yes, n=2 is losing.

So, seems correct.

Thus, the number of such n is 809.


--- Final Answer Content ---


Alice and Bob play a game with a stack of $n$ tokens, where each player can remove 1 or 4 tokens on their turn. Alice goes first, and the player who takes the last token wins. To determine the number of positive integers $n \leq 2024$ where Bob has a winning strategy, we analyze the game using combinatorial game theory.

We identify positions as either Winning (W) or Losing (L). A position is Losing if the current player cannot force a win, assuming optimal play. Through analysis, we find that the losing positions occur at $n \equiv 0 \pmod{5}$ and $n \equiv 2 \pmod{5}$. These positions recur every 5 numbers, creating a pattern of 2 losing positions in each cycle of 5.

To count the number of losing positions up to 2024:
1. **Numbers $\equiv 0 \pmod{5}$:** There are 404 such numbers (from 5 to 2020).
2. **Numbers $\equiv 2 \pmod{5}$:** These range from 2 to 2022, giving 405 numbers.

Adding these, we get $404 + 405 = 809$ losing positions. Thus, Bob can guarantee a win for 809 values of $n \leq 2024$.

The final answer is:

\boxed{809}
