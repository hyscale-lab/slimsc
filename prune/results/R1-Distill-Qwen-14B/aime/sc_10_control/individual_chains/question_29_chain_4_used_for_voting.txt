Alright, so I've got this geometry problem here, and I need to find the length of CE. Let me try to visualize and understand what's going on.

First, there are two rectangles, ABCD and EFGH. The points D, E, C, F are collinear, which means they lie on a straight line. Also, points A, D, H, G all lie on a circle. So, that's like a cyclic quadrilateral. The given lengths are BC = 16, AB = 107, FG = 17, and EF = 184. I need to find CE.

Hmm, okay. Let me start by sketching a rough diagram in my mind. Since ABCD is a rectangle, opposite sides are equal and all angles are right angles. So, AB is 107, which would make CD also 107. BC is 16, so AD is also 16. Similarly, EFGH is a rectangle, so FG is 17, which makes EH 17, and EF is 184, so GH is also 184.

The points D, E, C, F are collinear. So, if I imagine the line that these four points lie on, they must all be in a straight line. Let me think about how these rectangles are placed. Since ABCD and EFGH are separate rectangles, but some of their points lie on the same line.

Also, points A, D, H, G lie on a circle. So, ADHG is a cyclic quadrilateral. In cyclic quadrilaterals, the opposite angles sum to 180 degrees. Maybe that property could help me later.

Let me assign coordinates to these points to make it easier. Let's set up a coordinate system where point D is at the origin (0,0). Since ABCD is a rectangle, and D is at (0,0), then C would be at (107, 0) because DC is equal to AB, which is 107. Point B would then be at (107, 16), and point A would be at (0, 16).

Wait, hold on. Let me correct that. In a rectangle, adjacent sides are equal. So, AB is 107, BC is 16. So, if I have point D at (0,0), then since DC is equal to AB, which is 107, point C would be at (107, 0). Then, since BC is 16, point B would be at (107, 16). Then point A would be at (0, 16). Yeah, that's correct.

Now, EFGH is another rectangle. Let's think about where E, F, G, H would be. Since D, E, C, F are collinear, the line must pass through D (0,0) and C (107,0). So, E and F must also lie on the x-axis. Hmm, but wait, that can't be because both rectangles are on the same line. Wait, no, maybe not necessarily on the x-axis. Wait, no, because D is at (0,0) and C is at (107,0), which are on the x-axis. So, the line DC is along the x-axis. So, E and F must lie on the same line, which is the x-axis.

Wait, but EFGH is a rectangle. So, if F is on the x-axis, then G and H must be above or below. Since EFGH is a rectangle, FG is 17, EF is 184. So, point F is somewhere on the x-axis, and E is also on the x-axis. So, EF is 184, meaning the distance between E and F is 184. But wait, E, F, D, C are collinear, but D is at 0 and C is at 107. So, E and F must be on the same line as D and C, which is the x-axis.

Wait, but if E and F are on the same line as D and C, which is the x-axis, and EF is 184, which is longer than DC which is 107. So, E and F are points on the x-axis, but they are outside the segment DC because their distance is longer. So, E could be to the left of D, and F to the right of C, or vice versa.

But let me think about the rectangle EFGH. Since EF is 184 and FG is 17, the rectangle EFGH has sides 184 and 17. So, if I place E at (x, 0), then F would be at (x + 184, 0) or (x - 184, 0). Then, points G and H would be offset by 17 units vertically.

But I'm not sure yet where E and F are located on the x-axis. Let's denote E as (e, 0) and F as (e + 184, 0), assuming E is to the left of F. But wait, the order D, E, C, F are collinear. So, the points go D, E, C, F in that order on the line. So, that would mean that E is between D and C, and F is beyond C? Or is it D, E, C, F in a straight line, so E is before C and F is after C.

Wait, the problem says D, E, C, F are collinear. So, in the order D, E, C, F. So, starting from D, moving along the line, you hit E, then C, then F. So, D is at (0,0), E is somewhere on the x-axis between D and C, which is at (107,0). But wait, if EF is 184, that's way longer than DC (which is 107). So, if E is between D and C, then F would have to be beyond C, but how much? Let me see.

Let me assign coordinates accordingly. Let me let E be at (a, 0) where a is between 0 and 107. Then, F, being on the same line, would be at (a + 184, 0). But wait, since F must be beyond C, which is at (107, 0), so a + 184 = 107 + something. So, the distance from C to F is (a + 184) - 107. That would be CE is the distance from C to E, which is |107 - a|.

Wait, but in this case, E is between D and C, so CE would be 107 - a. And CF would be 107 - a + 184? Wait, no, because F is at (a + 184, 0). So, CF is (a + 184) - 107 = a + 184 - 107 = a + 77. But also, since E is at a, which is between D (0) and C (107), then a is between 0 and 107.

Alternatively, maybe E is to the left of D, and F is somewhere else. Wait, but the order is D, E, C, F. So, starting from D, moving along the line, we hit E, then C, then F. So, if D is at 0, E must be at some point after D, but before C. So, E is between D and C, and F is beyond C. So, E is at (a,0), 0 < a < 107, and F is at (a + 184, 0). But wait, that would place F at a + 184, which is way beyond C at 107. So, a can be at most 107 - 184, but that would be negative, which doesn't make sense because E is between D and C. Hmm, this suggests that my initial assumption might be wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps the order is D, E, C, F but E is not between D and C. Maybe E is to the left of D, and F is to the right of C. So, the order would be E, D, C, F on the x-axis. That could make sense if E is at a negative coordinate, D at 0, C at 107, and F at 107 + something, which would be 107 + 184 = 291? No, because EF is 184, so E is at (F - 184, 0). So, if F is at 291, E would be at 107 + 184 = 291 for F, so E would be at 291 - 184 = 107? That can't be.

Wait, perhaps I should think more carefully. Let me denote the coordinates:

Let me let the line containing D, E, C, F be the x-axis.

Let me denote point D as (d, 0), point E as (e, 0), point C as (c, 0), and point F as (f, 0). Since D, E, C, F are in that order on the line, we have d < e < c < f.

Wait, but in the problem, D is a point of rectangle ABCD, which I placed at (0,0). So, D is at (0,0). So, E must be at (e,0), where e > 0 because the order is D, E, C, F. Then, point C is at (107, 0), so e must be between 0 and 107.

Wait, but then F is at (e + 184, 0). Because in the rectangle EFGH, EF is 184. So, the distance between E and F is 184, so F is at (e + 184, 0). But F must be after C, so e + 184 > 107. That's fine because e is at least greater than 0. So, for example, if e is 20, then F is at 202, which is way beyond C at 107.

Now, given that EFGH is a rectangle, so FG is 17. So, point F is at (e + 184, 0). Then, point G would be at (e + 184, 17) or (e + 184, -17). Similarly, point H would be at (e, 17) or (e, -17). But the rectangle has sides EF and FG. So, if EF is along the x-axis from E(e,0) to F(e + 184, 0), then FG would go up or down from F. So, G is at (e + 184, 17) and H is at (e, 17). So, the rectangle is EFGH with E(e,0), F(e + 184,0), G(e + 184,17), H(e,17).

Wait, but the problem says that points A, D, H, G lie on a circle. So, A is at (0,16), D is at (0,0), H is at (e,17), and G is at (e + 184,17). So, these four points lie on a circle.

So, four points: (0,16), (0,0), (e,17), (e + 184,17). They must lie on a circle. So, let's use the general equation of a circle: x² + y² + 2gx + 2fy + c = 0. But since points A, D, H, G are on it, let's plug these points into the circle equation.

Alternatively, since three points define a circle, let's first find the equation of the circle passing through A, D, and H, and then verify that G lies on it.

Point A: (0,16)
Point D: (0,0)
Point H: (e,17)
Point G: (e + 184,17)

Let me find the circle passing through A, D, H.

Since points A and D are both on the y-axis at (0,16) and (0,0), the circle passing through them will have its center on the perpendicular bisector of AD. The midpoint of AD is (0,8), and the perpendicular bisector is the horizontal line y = 8.

Wait, no. The perpendicular bisector of a vertical line AD (from (0,0) to (0,16)) is a horizontal line that passes through the midpoint (0,8). So, the perpendicular bisector is the line y = 8.

So, the center of the circle lies somewhere on y = 8. Let me denote the center as (h, 8). The radius can be found using the distance from the center to any of the points A, D, or H.

Distance from center (h,8) to A(0,16):

√[(h - 0)^2 + (8 - 16)^2] = √[h² + 64] = radius.

Distance from center (h,8) to D(0,0):

√[(h - 0)^2 + (8 - 0)^2] = √[h² + 64] = same radius.

Distance from center (h,8) to H(e,17):

√[(h - e)^2 + (8 - 17)^2] = √[(h - e)^2 + 81] = radius.

Since all three distances must be equal:

√[h² + 64] = √[(h - e)^2 + 81]

Squaring both sides:

h² + 64 = (h - e)^2 + 81

Expanding the right side:

h² + 64 = h² - 2he + e² + 81

Subtract h² from both sides:

64 = -2he + e² + 81

Rearranging:

-2he + e² = 64 - 81 = -17

So:

-2he + e² = -17

Which can be rewritten as:

e² - 2he + 17 = 0

Hmm, so that's one equation involving h and e.

Now, we also need the fourth point G(e + 184,17) to lie on the same circle. Let's plug G into the circle equation.

The distance from the center (h,8) to G(e + 184, 17) should equal the radius.

Distance squared:

(h - (e + 184))² + (8 - 17)^2 = (h - e - 184)^2 + 81 = radius squared.

But radius squared is h² + 64, as previously.

So:

(h - e - 184)^2 + 81 = h² + 64

Expanding the left side:

(h - e - 184)^2 = (h - e)^2 - 368(h - e) + 184²

Wait, no, let me actually compute it step by step.

(h - e - 184)^2 = [ (h - e) - 184 ]² = (h - e)^2 - 2*184*(h - e) + 184²

So, adding 81:

= (h - e)^2 - 368(h - e) + 184² + 81

Set equal to h² + 64:

(h - e)^2 - 368(h - e) + 184² + 81 = h² + 64

But from earlier, (h - e)^2 = e² - 2he + h², as per expanding (h - e)^2. Wait, no, actually (h - e)^2 = h² - 2he + e².

Wait, let's substitute (h - e)^2 from the previous equation. From equation e² - 2he + 17 = 0, we have (h - e)^2 = (e² - 2he + h²) which is (h² - 2he + e²) = (h - e)^2.

But from the earlier equation, e² - 2he = -17. So, substituting into (h - e)^2:

(h - e)^2 = h² - 2he + e² = h² + (e² - 2he) = h² -17.

So, (h - e)^2 = h² -17.

So, going back to the equation:

(h - e)^2 - 368(h - e) + 184² + 81 = h² + 64

Substitute (h - e)^2 = h² -17:

(h² -17) - 368(h - e) + 184² +81 = h² +64

Simplify:

h² -17 -368h + 368e + 184² +81 = h² +64

Subtract h² from both sides:

-17 -368h + 368e + 184² +81 = 64

Combine constants:

-17 + 81 = 64.

So:

64 -368h + 368e + 184² = 64

Subtract 64 from both sides:

-368h + 368e + 184² = 0

Factor out 368:

368( -h + e ) + 184² = 0

Divide both sides by 368:

(-h + e) + (184²)/368 = 0

Simplify (184²)/368: Note that 184 is 2*92, and 368 is 4*92. So,

184² = (2*92)^2 = 4*92²

368 = 4*92

Thus, (184²)/368 = (4*92²)/(4*92) ) = 92.

So, equation becomes:

(-h + e) +92 =0

Which is:

e - h +92 = 0

So,

e = h -92

Now, from earlier, we had e² - 2he +17=0

We have e = h -92, so substitute into this equation:

(h -92)^2 - 2h(h -92) +17=0

Expand (h -92)^2:

h² - 184h + 92²

So, equation becomes:

h² -184h + 92² - 2h² + 184h +17=0

Simplify:

h² -184h + 8464 -2h² +184h +17 =0

Combine like terms:

(-h²) + ( -184h +184h ) + (8464 +17) =0

Which simplifies to:

 -h² + 0 + 8481 =0

So,

-h² +8481=0

Which leads to:

h² =8481

Take square root:

h= sqrt(8481)

Wait, sqrt(8481)... Let me compute that. Hmm, 92 squared is 8464, and 93 squared is 8649. So, 92^2=8464, 92.5^2= (92 + 0.5)^2= 92^2 +2*92*0.5 +0.25=8464 +92 +0.25=8556.25, which is higher than 8481. Wait, 92^2=8464, so 8481-8464=17. So, 92^2 +17=8481. So, sqrt(8481)=92 + something. Wait, but 92*92=8464, 93*93=8649.

Wait, maybe 8481 is a perfect square? Let me check 92^2=8464, 93^2=8649, so it's not. Hmm. Wait, 8481 divided by 3 is 2827, not a perfect square. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake in computation.

Wait, let's recalculate:

From the equation:

e = h -92

Substitute into e² -2he +17=0:

(h -92)^2 -2h(h -92)+17=0

Expanding (h-92)^2: h² -184h +92²

Then, -2h(h-92): -2h² +184h

Adding 17: +17

So, combining all terms:

h² -184h +92² -2h² +184h +17 = 0

Simplify terms:

h² -2h² = -h²

-184h +184h = 0

92² +17 = 8464 +17 = 8481

So, equation is:

 -h² +8481 = 0 → h² =8481

So, h= sqrt(8481). Wait, 8481 divided by 3 is 2827, which is not a perfect square. Let me check 8481 divided by 9: 8481/9=942.333... Not an integer. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake earlier.

Wait, perhaps my initial assumption about the positions of E and F is wrong. Let me double-check.

Wait, so we have EFGH as a rectangle, with EF=184 and FG=17. If E is at (e,0) and F is at (e + 184,0), then G would be at (e + 184,17) and H at (e,17). But, the problem states that D, E, C, F are collinear, with D=0,0; C=107,0. So, E is between D and C, so e is between 0 and 107, and F is at e +184, which is beyond C.

But then, in the circle equation, we ended up with h²=8481, which is not a perfect square, which complicates things because h is supposed to be a coordinate of the center, which may not necessarily be an integer. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the earlier steps. Let me go back.

We have four points on the circle: A(0,16), D(0,0), H(e,17), G(e + 184,17). The circle's center is at (h,8), as determined because the perpendicular bisector of AD is y=8, so the center must lie on that line.

Then, we set up the equation for the radius from center (h,8) to A(0,16) and H(e,17) being equal.

So,

√(h² + (8-16)^2) = √[(h - e)^2 + (8 -17)^2]

Which gives:

√(h² + 64) = √[(h - e)^2 +81]

Squaring both sides:

h² +64 = (h - e)^2 +81

Which leads to:

h² +64 = h² - 2eh + e² +81

Simplify:

64 = -2eh + e² +81

Then:

-2eh + e² = -17 → e² - 2eh = -17 → e² -2eh +17 = 0 → equation (1)

Then, considering point G(e + 184,17):

Distance from center (h,8) to G is:

√[(h - (e + 184))² + (8 -17)^2] = √[(h - e -184)^2 +81]

Which must equal radius, which is √(h² +64). Squaring both sides:

(h - e -184)^2 +81 = h² +64

Expand (h - e -184)^2:

= (h - e)^2 - 368(h - e) + 184²

So,

(h - e)^2 -368(h - e) + (184)^2 +81 = h² +64

But from equation (1), we have (h - e)^2 = e² - 2eh + h² = (from equation (1), e² -2eh = -17, so (h -e)^2 = h² + (-17) )

Wait, no, (h - e)^2 = h² - 2he + e², and from equation (1), e² -2he = -17, so h² - 2he + e² = h² -17.

So, substituting (h - e)^2 = h² -17 into the equation:

(h² -17) -368(h - e) + 184² +81 = h² +64

Simplify:

h² -17 -368h +368e + 184² +81 = h² +64

Subtract h² from both sides:

-17 -368h +368e + 184² +81 =64

Combine constants:

-17 +81=64. So,

64 -368h +368e +184²=64

Subtract 64:

-368h +368e +184² =0

Factor 368:

368*(e - h) +184²=0

Divide both sides by 368:

(e - h) + (184²)/368 =0

Simplify 184² /368:

184²= (184)^2 =33856

33856 /368= 33856 ÷368. Let me compute that.

368 ×92= 368 ×90=33120, plus 368×2=736. So, 33120 +736=33856. So, 368 ×92=33856. So, 184² /368=92.

Thus,

(e - h) +92=0 → e = h -92

So, e = h -92.

Now, substitute e into equation (1):

e² -2he +17=0

e = h -92 → (h -92)^2 -2h*(h -92) +17=0

Expand (h -92)^2:

h² -184h +92²

So,

h² -184h +92² -2h² +184h +17=0

Simplify:

h² -2h²= -h²

-184h +184h=0

92² +17 = 8464 +17=8481

So,

-h² +8481=0 → h²=8481 → h= sqrt(8481).

Wait, sqrt(8481)=sqrt(92² +17)= but 92²=8464, 93²=8649, so sqrt(8481) is between 92 and 93. But is 8481 a perfect square? Let me check.

Compute 92^2=8464, 92×93= (92×90)+(92×3)=8280 + 276=8556, which is higher than 8481. So, perhaps 8481 is 92.1^2? No, but maybe it's not an integer. So, h=√8481.

Wait, maybe I made an error in the algebra earlier. Let me double-check the equations.

Wait, from the circle equation for point G:

(h - (e +184))^2 + (8 -17)^2 = h² +64

Which is:

(h - e -184)^2 +81 = h² +64

Expanding (h - e -184)^2:

= (h -e)^2 - 368(h -e) + 184²

So,

(h -e)^2 -368(h -e) +184² +81 = h² +64

But (h -e)^2 from equation (1) is h² -17.

So,

(h² -17) -368(h -e) +184² +81 = h² +64

Simplify:

h² -17 -368h +368e + 184² +81 = h² +64

Subtract h²:

-17 -368h +368e +184² +81 =64

Combine constants:

-17 +81=64, so,

64 -368h +368e +184²=64

Subtract 64:

-368h +368e +184²=0

Factor:

368(e -h) +184²=0 → 368(e -h) = -184²

Divide both sides by 184:

2(e - h) = -184

Thus,

2e -2h = -184 → e -h = -92 → e = h -92

Yes, that's correct. So, e =h -92.

Substituting into equation (1):

e² -2he +17=0 → (h -92)^2 -2h(h -92) +17=0

Expanding:

h² -184h +92² -2h² +184h +17=0 → -h² + (92² +17)=0 → h²=92² +17= 8464 +17=8481 → h= sqrt(8481)

Hmm, okay, so h is sqrt(8481). Let me compute sqrt(8481). Let me see:

92^2=8464, 93^2=8649. So, 92.1^2=92^2 + 2*92*0.1 +0.1^2=8464 +18.4 +0.01=8482.41, which is more than 8481. So, sqrt(8481) is approximately 92.098...

But perhaps 8481 is 92.098... squared. But it's not an exact integer, which is fine, but perhaps I can express it as 92.098 or in terms of exact value.

Wait, but maybe 8481 is a multiple of some square. Let me factor 8481.

Divide by 3: 8481 ÷3=2827.

2827: Let's check if it's divisible by 7: 7*404=2828, so no. 2827 ÷7=403.857… nope.

Divide by 13: 13*217=2821, 2827-2821=6, so no.

Hmm, maybe 2827 is prime? Not sure, but perhaps 8481=3*2827, and 2827 is prime. So, sqrt(8481)=sqrt(3*2827). Hmm, which is not a perfect square.

So, perhaps I can proceed without knowing the exact value of h, by expressing CE in terms of e.

Wait, CE is the distance from C to E. Point C is at (107,0) and point E is at (e,0). So, CE = |107 - e|.

So, if I can find e, then I can find CE.

From earlier, e = h -92, and h²=8481.

So, e= sqrt(8481) -92.

But we need to find CE= |107 - e|.

So, CE= |107 - (sqrt(8481) -92)| = |107 +92 - sqrt(8481)|= |199 - sqrt(8481)|.

Now, sqrt(8481) is approximately 92.098, so 199 -92.098≈106.902, which is approximately 107. But that's close to CE=107, but perhaps it's exactly 107?

Wait, let me check:

If CE=107, then e=107 -107=0. But point E is at e=0, which is point D. But in the problem, D, E are distinct points, as are C and F. So, e cannot be 0 because E would coincide with D.

Hmm, that suggests that my earlier approach is missing something.

Wait, perhaps the rectangle EFGH is constructed in the other direction. Maybe FG is not upwards but downwards. So, point F is at (e + 184,0), point G is at (e +184, -17), and point H is at (e, -17). So, the rectangle is below the x-axis.

In that case, the circle would pass through A(0,16), D(0,0), H(e, -17), G(e +184, -17).

Let me try this scenario.

So, with H at (e, -17) and G at (e +184, -17). Let's redo the circle equation.

Points on the circle: A(0,16), D(0,0), H(e, -17), G(e +184, -17).

Again, let's find the circle passing through these four points.

As before, points A and D are on the y-axis. The perpendicular bisector of AD is y=8, so the center is at (h,8).

Distance from center (h,8) to A(0,16):

√(h² + (8 -16)^2) = √(h² +64) = radius.

Distance from center (h,8) to H(e, -17):

√[(h - e)^2 + (8 +17)^2] = √[(h - e)^2 + 625] = radius.

Set equal:

√(h² +64) = √[(h -e)^2 +625]

Squaring both sides:

h² +64 = (h -e)^2 +625

→ h² +64 = h² -2he +e² +625

→ 64 = -2he + e² +625

→ e² -2he +625 -64=0 → e² -2he +561=0 → equation (1)

Now, distance from center (h,8) to G(e +184, -17):

√[(h -e -184)^2 + (8 +17)^2] = √[(h -e -184)^2 +625] = radius.

Set equal to radius squared:

(h -e -184)^2 +625 = h² +64

Expand (h -e -184)^2:

= (h -e)^2 - 368(h -e) + 184²

So,

(h -e)^2 -368(h -e) + 184² +625 = h² +64

But from equation (1), we have (h -e)^2 = e² -2he + h². From equation (1), e² -2he = -561, so (h -e)^2 = (e² -2he) + h² = h² -561.

Substituting into the equation:

(h² -561) -368(h -e) +184² +625 = h² +64

Simplify:

h² -561 -368h +368e + 184² +625 = h² +64

Subtract h²:

-561 -368h +368e + 184² +625 =64

Combine constants:

-561 +625=64. So,

64 -368h +368e +184²=64

Subtract 64:

-368h +368e +184²=0

Factor:

368(e -h) +184²=0

Divide by 368:

(e -h) + (184²)/368=0

As before, 184²=33856, 33856/368=92.

So,

e -h +92=0 → e = h -92

Now, substitute e =h -92 into equation (1):

e² -2he +561=0 → (h -92)^2 -2h(h -92) +561=0

Expand (h -92)^2:

h² -184h +92²

So,

h² -184h +92² -2h² +184h +561=0

Simplify:

h² -2h²= -h²

-184h +184h=0

92² +561= 8464 +561=9025

So,

-h² +9025=0 → h²=9025 → h= sqrt(9025)=95

Because 95^2=9025. Great, that works!

So, h=95. Then e= h -92=95 -92=3.

So, e=3.

So, point E is at (3,0), F is at (3 +184,0)= (187,0). Point G is at (187, -17), and H is at (3, -17).

Now, CE is the distance from C(107,0) to E(3,0), which is |107 -3|=104.

Wait, that's a nice integer. So, CE=104.

Let me verify this.

So, e=3, h=95.

So, the center is at (95,8).

Radius squared is 95² +64=9025 +64=9089.

Check distance from center to H(3,-17):

√[(95 -3)^2 + (8 +17)^2] = √[92² +25²] = √[8464 +625] = √9089.

Yes, same as radius.

Distance from center to G(187,-17):

√[(95 -187)^2 + (8 +17)^2] = √[(-92)^2 +25^2] = same as above.

And distance from center to A(0,16):

√[95² + (8 -16)^2] = √[9025 +64]=√9089.

All points lie on the circle. So, this makes sense.

Therefore, CE is 107 -3=104.

To solve the problem, we analyze the given rectangles $ABCD$ and $EFGH$ and use the properties of cyclic quadrilaterals and coordinates to find the length of $CE$.

1. **Assigning Coordinates:**
   - Place $D$ at $(0, 0)$, $C$ at $(107, 0)$, $A$ at $(0, 16)$, and $B$ at $(107, 16)$ for rectangle $ABCD$.
   - Points $D, E, C, F$ are collinear on the x-axis. Let $E$ be at $(e, 0)$ and $F$ at $(e + 184, 0)$ for rectangle $EFGH$.

2. **Circle Through Points $A, D, H, G$:**
   - Points $A(0, 16)$, $D(0, 0)$, $H(e, -17)$, and $G(e + 184, -17)$ lie on a circle. The center of the circle lies on the perpendicular bisector of $AD$, which is the line $y = 8$. Let the center be $(h, 8)$.

3. **Using the Circle Equation:**
   - The radius squared from the center $(h, 8)$ to $A$ is $h^2 + 64$.
   - The radius squared to $H(e, -17)$ is $(h - e)^2 + 625$. Equating these gives:
     \[
     h^2 + 64 = (h - e)^2 + 625 \implies e^2 - 2he + 561 = 0.
     \]
   - The radius squared to $G(e + 184, -17)$ is $(h - e - 184)^2 + 625$. Equating this to $h^2 + 64$ and simplifying leads to:
     \[
     e = h - 92.
     \]
   - Substituting $e = h - 92$ into $e^2 - 2he + 561 = 0$ gives $h^2 = 9025$, so $h = 95$. Thus, $e = 3$.

4. **Calculating $CE$:**
   - Point $E$ is at $(3, 0)$, and point $C$ is at $(107, 0)$. The distance $CE$ is:
     \[
     CE = |107 - 3| = 104.
     \]

**Final Answer:** $\boxed{104}$
