Okay, so I've got this math problem here about Jen entering a lottery. Let me try to parse it step by step.

So, Jen picks 4 distinct numbers from the set S, which is {1,2,3,...,9,10}. Then, the lottery randomly picks 4 numbers from the same set S. She wins a prize if at least two of her numbers match the four randomly chosen numbers. She wins the grand prize if all four of her numbers match. The question is asking for the probability that she wins the grand prize given that she won a prize. They mention that this probability can be expressed as a fraction m/n, where m and n are coprime, and we need to find m + n.

Alright, so to rephrase, we're dealing with conditional probability. The probability of event A (winning grand prize) given event B (winning a prize) is P(A|B) = P(A ∩ B)/P(B). But since if she wins the grand prize, she must have won a prize, A is a subset of B. So P(A ∩ B) is just P(A). So, P(A|B) = P(A)/P(B).

So, our goal is to compute P(A), which is the probability that all four of her numbers are chosen, and P(B), the probability that at least two of her numbers are chosen. Then, we'll take their ratio.

Let me compute these probabilities step by step.

First, let's figure out the total number of possible ways the lottery can choose 4 numbers from S. Since S has 10 elements, the number of possible combinations is C(10,4). 

C(10,4) is calculated as 10! / (4! * (10-4)!) = (10*9*8*7)/(4*3*2*1) = 210. So, there are 210 possible four-number combinations.

Now, let's compute P(A). P(A) is the probability that all four of Jen's numbers are the ones chosen. Since Jen has picked a specific set of four numbers, the number of favorable outcomes is 1 (only her specific combination). So, P(A) = 1/210.

Next, let's compute P(B). P(B) is the probability that at least two of her numbers are chosen. So, this includes cases where exactly two, exactly three, or exactly four numbers are chosen. We already know P(A) is the case where exactly four are chosen. So, to find P(B), we need to compute the probability of having exactly two or exactly three matches, and then add all three (exactly four, exactly three, exactly two) probabilities together. Actually, wait, no. Wait: the problem states she wins a prize if at least two of her numbers are chosen. So, that includes exactly two, exactly three, and exactly four. So, yes, we need to compute the sum of these probabilities.

Alternatively, sometimes it's easier to compute the probability of the complementary event and subtract from 1. The complementary event of having at least two matches is having fewer than two matches, i.e., zero or one matches. So, P(B) = 1 - P(zero matches) - P(exactly one match).

Let me try both approaches and see which is easier.

First approach: compute P(exactly two) + P(exactly three) + P(exactly four). 

Second approach: compute 1 - P(zero) - P(one). 

I think the second approach might be easier because calculating P(zero) and P(one) might be simpler.

Let's go with the second approach.

So, P(B) = 1 - P(zero matches) - P(exactly one match).

Let's compute P(zero matches). That's the probability that none of Jen's four numbers are chosen. So, the lottery picks 4 numbers entirely from the remaining 6 numbers (since S has 10, and 4 are excluded). So, the number of ways to choose 4 numbers from the 6 non-Jen numbers is C(6,4). 

C(6,4) = 15. So, the number of zero-match combinations is 15. Therefore, P(zero matches) = 15/210 = 1/14.

Next, compute P(exactly one match). This is the probability that exactly one of Jen's four numbers is chosen, and the remaining three are from the other six numbers.

To compute this, first choose 1 number from Jen's 4, and then choose 3 numbers from the remaining 6. So, the number of such combinations is C(4,1)*C(6,3).

C(4,1) is 4, and C(6,3) is 20. So, 4*20=80.

Therefore, the number of exactly one-match combinations is 80, so P(exactly one match) = 80/210.

Simplify that: 80/210 = 8/21.

So, now, P(B) = 1 - P(zero) - P(one) = 1 - (1/14 + 8/21).

Let me compute 1/14 + 8/21. To add these, they need a common denominator. 14 and 21 have a least common multiple of 42. 

1/14 = 3/42, and 8/21 = 16/42. So, together, 3/42 + 16/42 = 19/42.

Therefore, P(B) = 1 - 19/42 = (42/42 - 19/42) = 23/42.

Wait, let me double-check that calculation:

Yes, 1/14 is approximately 0.0714, and 8/21 is about 0.38095. Adding them gives roughly 0.4523, which is approximately 19/42 (since 19 ÷ 42 ≈ 0.4523). So, subtracting from 1 gives 23/42, which is about 0.5476.

Alternatively, let's compute P(B) directly by adding P(exactly two) + P(exactly three) + P(exactly four). 

But wait, since we know P(B) = 23/42, perhaps we can verify this another way.

Alternatively, compute P(exactly two), P(exactly three), and P(exactly four) and sum them.

Compute P(exactly two):

It's the number of ways to choose 2 from Jen's 4 and 2 from the remaining 6. So, C(4,2)*C(6,2).

C(4,2) = 6, C(6,2) = 15. So, 6*15=90.

P(exactly two) = 90/210 = 3/7.

Similarly, P(exactly three):

C(4,3)*C(6,1) = 4*6=24.

P(exactly three) = 24/210 = 4/35.

P(exactly four) = 1/210.

Adding these together: 90 + 24 +1 = 115. So, 115/210.

Simplify 115/210: divide numerator and denominator by 5, which gives 23/42. That matches our previous result. So, P(B) is indeed 23/42.

So, now, P(A) is 1/210, and P(B) is 23/42.

So, the conditional probability P(A|B) = P(A)/P(B) = (1/210)/(23/42).

Let me compute this: (1/210) / (23/42) = (1/210) * (42/23) = (42)/(210*23) = (42)/(4830).

Simplify 42/4830: both numerator and denominator are divisible by 42.

42 ÷ 42 = 1.

4830 ÷ 42: Let's compute 42*115 = 4830 (since 42*100=4200, 42*15=630; 4200+630=4830). So, 42/4830 = 1/115.

Wait, really? So, P(A|B) is 1/115.

But let me double-check the computation:

(1/210) divided by (23/42) is equal to (1/210) * (42/23) = (42)/(210*23).

42 divided by 210 is 1/5, because 42*5=210. So, 42/210 = 1/5.

So, 42/(210*23) = (1/5)/23 = 1/(5*23) = 1/115.

Yes, that seems correct.

So, the probability is 1/115, which is already in its simplest form as a fraction since 1 and 115 are coprime (factors of 115 are 1,5,23; 1 shares no common factors with 115 except 1).

Therefore, m = 1, n = 115. So, m + n = 1 + 115 = 116.

Wait a second, but hold on. Let me just make sure I didn't make a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, P(A) is 1/210, and P(B) is 23/42.

So, 1/210 divided by 23/42 is (1/210) * (42/23) = (42)/(210*23). 

42 divided by 210 is 0.2, which is 1/5. So, 1/5 divided by 23 is 1/(5*23) = 1/115.

Yes, that's correct.

Alternatively, 210 is 5*42, so 42/210 is 1/5. So, 1/210 is (1/5)/42, so (1/210)/(23/42) = (1/5)/42 * 42/23 = (1/5)/23 = 1/115.

Yes, same result.

So, the answer is 1/115, so m + n is 1 + 115 = 116.

Therefore, I think the answer is 116.

To solve the problem, we need to find the probability of Jen winning the grand prize given that she won a prize. This is a conditional probability problem where we use the formula \( P(A|B) = \frac{P(A \cap B)}{P(B)} \). Since winning the grand prize implies winning a prize, \( P(A \cap B) = P(A) \), so \( P(A|B) = \frac{P(A)}{P(B)} \).

1. **Total number of possible lottery combinations**:  
   The total number of ways to choose 4 numbers from 10 is \( \binom{10}{4} = 210 \).

2. **Probability of winning the grand prize (\( P(A) \))**:  
   There is only 1 favorable outcome (Jen's exact 4 numbers), so \( P(A) = \frac{1}{210} \).

3. **Probability of winning a prize (\( P(B) \))**:  
   Jen wins a prize if at least two of her numbers are chosen. Instead of calculating this directly, we calculate the complementary probability of winning no prize (i.e., fewer than two matches) and subtract it from 1.  
   - **Zero matches**: The number of ways to choose 4 numbers from the remaining 6 is \( \binom{6}{4} = 15 \). Thus, \( P(\text{zero matches}) = \frac{15}{210} = \frac{1}{14} \).  
   - **Exactly one match**: The number of ways to choose 1 number from Jen's 4 and 3 from the remaining 6 is \( \binom{4}{1} \times \binom{6}{3} = 4 \times 20 = 80 \). Thus, \( P(\text{exactly one match}) = \frac{80}{210} = \frac{8}{21} \).  
   - Therefore, \( P(B) = 1 - \left( \frac{1}{14} + \frac{8}{21} \right) = 1 - \frac{19}{42} = \frac{23}{42} \).

4. **Conditional probability**:  
   \( P(A|B) = \frac{P(A)}{P(B)} = \frac{\frac{1}{210}}{\frac{23}{42}} = \frac{1}{210} \times \frac{42}{23} = \frac{42}{4830} = \frac{1}{115} \).

5. **Simplify and find \( m + n \)**:  
   The fraction \( \frac{1}{115} \) is in simplest form, so \( m = 1 \) and \( n = 115 \). Thus, \( m + n = 1 + 115 = 116 \).

The final answer is:

\boxed{116}
