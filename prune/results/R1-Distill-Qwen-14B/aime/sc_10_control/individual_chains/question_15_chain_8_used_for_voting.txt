Okay, so I'm trying to solve this problem about counting paths on an 8x8 grid. The paths are of length 16, which makes sense because each path goes from the lower left corner to the upper right corner, moving only right or up. But the twist here is that the paths must change direction exactly four times. Hmm, okay, I need to figure out how to approach this.

First, I remember that in a grid, moving from the lower left to the upper right on an 8x8 grid means you have to make 8 moves to the right and 8 moves up, totaling 16 moves. The total number of paths without any restrictions is the combination of 16 moves taken 8 at a time, which is C(16,8). But that's just the total paths, not considering the direction changes.

Now, the problem is about paths that change direction exactly four times. So, what does it mean to change direction? Each time the path switches from moving right to up or from up to right, that's a direction change. So, in a path, each time you switch direction, that's one change.

Let me think about how direction changes relate to the number of straight segments in the path. If a path changes direction exactly four times, how many straight segments does it have? Well, each direction change adds a new segment. Starting with one segment, each change adds another. So, for four changes, the number of segments would be 5. So, the path is made up of 5 straight segments, alternating between right and up.

Wait, but in an 8x8 grid, the path must end at the upper right corner, so the starting direction could be either right or up. Hmm, but does it matter? I think it does because the number of right and up segments could be different based on that. Let me think.

If the first move is to the right, then the segments would alternate right, up, right, up, etc. Similarly, if the first move is up, it alternates up, right, etc. But since the total number of right and up moves are both 8, which is an even number, the number of segments in each direction must be the same. Wait, if there are 5 segments, considering the direction changes, then perhaps if the path starts with right, it will have 3 right segments and 2 up segments, or is it the other way around?

Wait, no. Let me think again. If you have 5 segments and you alternate directions, starting with right, then the segments would be right, up, right, up, right. So that's 3 right segments and 2 up segments. But in total, the number of right moves is 8, and up moves is 8. So each right segment must sum up to 8, same with up segments.

Wait, that's impossible if you have 3 right segments and 2 up segments. Because 8 divided by 3 isn't an integer. So, that must mean that for the number of segments, the number of right and up segments must both be equal, right? Because 8 can be divided equally into segments.

Wait, perhaps I need to adjust my approach. Let's see. The total number of direction changes is 4, which implies 5 segments. Since the starting segment can be either right or up, so the number of right segments and up segments would differ by one. For example, if starting with right, you have 3 right segments and 2 up segments, or starting with up, you have 3 up segments and 2 right segments. But wait, 8 can't be evenly divided into 3 segments for both directions. Hmm, maybe not.

Wait a second, maybe I made a mistake here. Let's consider that each segment is a straight line of consecutive rights or consecutive ups. The number of such segments depends on the number of direction changes. So, if a path has exactly four direction changes, it must have 5 segments. So, whether you start with right or up, the number of right segments and up segments will differ by one, because 5 is odd.

But wait, the total number of right moves is 8 and up moves is also 8. So, if the path starts with right, then the number of right segments is (number of segments +1)/2 and the number of up segments is (number of segments -1)/2. Since 5 segments, so 3 right and 2 up segments. But 8 divided by 3 is 8/3, which is not an integer. That's a problem because each right segment must consist of an integer number of steps. Similarly, 8 divided by 2 is 4, which is integer. So this can't be.

Wait, so perhaps starting with right isn't possible because 8 can't be divided into 3 integer lengths. Alternatively, maybe the starting direction must be such that 8 can be divided into the number of segments. Let me think.

Alternatively, maybe the number of right segments and up segments must both divide 8. So, for 5 segments, if you start with right, then you have 3 right segments and 2 up segments. For 3 right segments, each segment must contribute 8/3 steps, which isn't possible because 8 isn't divisible by 3. Similarly, if you start with up, you have 3 up segments and 2 right segments. 8 divided by 3 is again not an integer. So, wait a minute, that suggests that it's impossible to have 5 segments with 8 steps in each direction. Hmm, that can't be right, because the problem says there are examples shown.

Wait, perhaps my initial assumption is wrong. Maybe the direction changes aren't necessarily alternating between right and up. No, that doesn't make sense because each time you change direction, you switch from right to up or up to right. So, direction changes have to alternate.

Wait, okay, perhaps I'm approaching this wrong. Let me think about how the direction changes are structured. Each time you change direction, you switch from right to up or vice versa. So, for 4 direction changes, the path must have 5 runs. Each run is a consecutive set of steps in the same direction.

So, if the path starts with a right run, then the runs would be right, up, right, up, right. So, three right runs and two up runs. Similarly, if it starts with up, it would be up, right, up, right, up. Three up runs and two right runs.

But in both cases, the number of steps in each run must sum to 8 for each direction. So, for the right runs: if there are three right runs, each run must have 8/3 steps, which isn't an integer. Similarly, for up runs, if there are three up runs, each would be 8/3 steps. So, that can't be.

Hmm, maybe I'm missing something here. Alternatively, perhaps the number of runs is different. Wait, maybe I'm miscalculating the number of runs. If you have four direction changes, that means you have five runs. But if you start with right, the number of right runs is three, and up runs is two. So, the sum of right runs is 8, so each right run would have 8/3 steps. But that's not possible.

Wait, maybe the runs don't have to be the same length. Oh! I see. Each run can have a different number of steps, as long as the total is 8 for each direction. So, for example, if you have three right runs, their lengths must add up to 8, and similarly, two up runs must add up to 8. So, the lengths can vary.

So, the problem reduces to finding the number of ways to partition 8 into a certain number of positive integers. For right runs, if it's three runs, the number of ways to partition 8 into three positive integers, and similarly for up runs.

So, the approach would be:

1. Determine the number of right runs and up runs based on the starting direction.
2. For each direction, compute the number of ways to partition 8 into the required number of positive integers.
3. Multiply these two numbers together for each case (starting with right or starting with up).
4. Sum the results from both starting directions.

But wait, in this problem, since the grid is symmetric, starting with right or up might have the same number of paths. So, perhaps we can compute one and double it? Let me check.

Wait, no, because the number of right runs and up runs depends on starting direction. So, let's proceed step by step.

Case 1: The path starts with a right run.

Number of right runs: 3
Number of up runs: 2

Number of ways to split 8 into 3 right runs: That's the number of integer solutions to a + b + c = 8, where a, b, c ≥ 1. That's C(8-1,3-1) = C(7,2) = 21.

Similarly, number of ways to split 8 into 2 up runs: a + b =8, a,b ≥1. That's C(8-1,2-1)=C(7,1)=7.

So, total paths starting with right: 21 * 7 = 147.

Case 2: The path starts with an up run.

Number of up runs: 3
Number of right runs: 2

Number of ways to split 8 into 3 up runs: C(7,2)=21.

Number of ways to split 8 into 2 right runs: C(7,1)=7.

So, total paths starting with up: 21 *7=147.

So, total paths: 147 +147=294.

Wait, so is the answer 294? Hmm, but let me think again.

Wait, another way to compute the number of paths with exactly four direction changes is to consider that each path must have 5 runs. Each run is either all right or all up. So, the total number of such paths is equal to the number of compositions of 8 into 3 parts (for one direction) multiplied by the number of compositions of 8 into 2 parts (for the other direction), multiplied by 2 (for starting with right or up).

Wait, that's exactly what I did. So, 2 * [C(7,2) * C(7,1)] = 2*(21*7)=2*147=294.

But wait, let me make sure that I counted correctly.

The number of compositions of 8 into 3 parts is C(8-1,3-1)=C(7,2)=21. Similarly, compositions into 2 parts is C(7,1)=7. So yes, that seems correct.

Alternatively, another approach: the number of lattice paths from (0,0) to (8,8) with exactly four direction changes is equal to 2 * C(7,2) * C(7,1). Which is 2*21*7=294.

So, is 294 the correct answer?

Wait, but let me think about whether the starting direction affects the count. Since the grid is symmetric, starting with right or up should contribute equally, so multiplying by 2 makes sense.

Wait, but another way to think about it: the number of such paths is 2 * (number of compositions of 8 into 3 parts) * (number of compositions of 8 into 2 parts).

Which is 2 * 21 *7 = 294.

Hmm, that seems consistent.

Alternatively, perhaps I can model this problem as arranging the runs.

Each path has 5 runs, alternating between right and up. So, starting with right, the runs are R, U, R, U, R. So, three R runs and two U runs. Each R run has length ≥1, and the sum of R run lengths is 8. Similarly, each U run is ≥1 and sum to 8.

The number of ways for R runs is the number of compositions of 8 into 3 parts, which is C(7,2)=21. Similarly, the number of compositions for U runs into 2 parts is C(7,1)=7.

So, for starting with R, it's 21 *7=147. Similarly, starting with U, it's also 21 *7=147. So, total 294.

Yes, that makes sense.

Wait, but let me make sure I didn't miss anything. Are there any constraints I'm not considering? For example, in an 8x8 grid, the maximum number of right or up moves is 8, so as long as the compositions don't exceed that, which they don't because each run is at least 1.

Therefore, the total number of such paths is 294.

So, the answer is 294.

To solve the problem, we need to count the number of paths from the lower left corner to the upper right corner of an 8×8 grid that change direction exactly four times. Each path consists of 16 moves: 8 right (R) and 8 up (U). A direction change occurs when the path switches from R to U or U to R. 

A path with exactly four direction changes consists of 5 segments (runs) of consecutive moves in one direction, alternating between R and U. Since the grid is symmetric, we consider two cases: paths starting with R and paths starting with U.

### Case 1: Path starts with R
- The path has 3 R runs and 2 U runs.
- The number of ways to partition 8 R moves into 3 runs is the number of compositions of 8 into 3 parts, which is \( \binom{7}{2} = 21 \).
- The number of ways to partition 8 U moves into 2 runs is \( \binom{7}{1} = 7 \).
- Total paths starting with R: \( 21 \times 7 = 147 \).

### Case 2: Path starts with U
- The path has 3 U runs and 2 R runs.
- The number of ways to partition 8 U moves into 3 runs is \( \binom{7}{2} = 21 \).
- The number of ways to partition 8 R moves into 2 runs is \( \binom{7}{1} = 7 \).
- Total paths starting with U: \( 21 \times 7 = 147 \).

### Total Paths
Adding both cases, the total number of paths is \( 147 + 147 = 294 \).

### Final Answer
The number of such paths is \(\boxed{294}\).
