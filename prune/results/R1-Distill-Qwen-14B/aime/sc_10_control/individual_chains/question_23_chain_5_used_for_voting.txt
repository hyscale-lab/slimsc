Okay, so I've got this problem here about a hyperbola and a rhombus inscribed in it. The hyperbola is given by the equation x²/20 - y²/24 = 1. Points A, B, C, D lie on this hyperbola, forming a rhombus ABCD. The diagonals of this rhombus intersect at the origin. I need to find the greatest real number that is less than BD² for all such rhombi. Essentially, I need to find the infimum or the lower bound of BD².

Hmm, let me recall what a rhombus is. A rhombus is a quadrilateral with all sides equal in length, and its diagonals bisect each other at right angles. Wait, no, actually, in a rhombus, the diagonals bisect each other and they bisect the angles, but they aren't necessarily perpendicular unless it's a square. Wait, no, actually, in a rhombus, the diagonals are not necessarily perpendicular, but in a square, they are. Wait, no, no, I think I confused that with a kite. Wait, no, in a rhombus, the diagonals are perpendicular. Yes, okay, I think that's right. So, in a rhombus, the diagonals are perpendicular bisectors of each other.

So, given that the diagonals intersect at the origin, which is the center of the hyperbola. That makes sense because the hyperbola is symmetric about the origin.

So, the hyperbola is centered at the origin, opening along the x-axis because the positive term is with x². The standard form is x²/a² - y²/b² = 1, so here, a²=20 and b²=24, so a=√20=2√5 and b=√24=2√6.

Now, since the rhombus is inscribed in the hyperbola and the diagonals intersect at the origin, the points A, B, C, D must be symmetric with respect to the origin. So, if point A is (x,y), then point C, which is opposite, would be (-x,-y). Similarly, point B is (u,v), then point D is (-u,-v). Wait, but in a rhombus, the diagonals bisect each other, so the other two points would be such that their midpoint is also the origin. So yes, if A is (x,y), then C is (-x,-y), and if B is (u,v), D is (-u,-v).

So, the four points are A(x,y), B(u,v), C(-x,-y), D(-u,-v). Connecting these points in order would make a rhombus.

Since ABCD is a rhombus, all sides are equal. So, the distance between A and B should be equal to the distance between B and C, and so on.

But perhaps it's easier to use the properties of the diagonals. In a rhombus, the diagonals are perpendicular and bisect each other. So, the diagonals AC and BD intersect at the origin and are perpendicular.

So, the diagonal AC has endpoints at (x,y) and (-x,-y), so it's a line segment from (x,y) to (-x,-y). The diagonal BD has endpoints at (u,v) and (-u,-v).

So, since the diagonals are perpendicular, the product of their slopes should be -1.

Let me compute the slopes. The slope of AC is (y - (-y))/(x - (-x)) = (2y)/(2x) = y/x. Similarly, the slope of BD is (v - (-v))/(u - (-u)) = (2v)/(2u) = v/u.

Since they are perpendicular, (y/x) * (v/u) = -1. So, (yv)/(xu) = -1, which implies yv = -xu.

So, that's one condition.

Now, since all four points lie on the hyperbola, they must satisfy the equation x²/20 - y²/24 = 1 and similarly for u and v. So,

x²/20 - y²/24 = 1

u²/20 - v²/24 = 1

Also, because it's a rhombus, the sides are equal in length. So, the distance between A and B should equal the distance between B and C.

Wait, but actually, since diagonals bisect each other at the origin, perhaps another approach is better. Let me think.

In a rhombus, the diagonals satisfy the relationship: (d1/2)² + (d2/2)² = side². Because each side can be considered as the hypotenuse of a right triangle formed by half of each diagonal.

So, if AC and BD are diagonals, then (AC/2)² + (BD/2)^2 = (AB)^2.

But since all sides are equal, this should hold for any adjacent sides.

Alternatively, since all sides are equal, the distance between A and B should equal the distance between B and C.

But perhaps considering vectors would help here.

Let me think of vectors OA and OB, where O is the origin. Then, points A is at vector a, and B is at vector b. Since ABCD is a rhombus, the position vectors of the points are such that vectors a, b, -a, -b form the rhombus.

Wait, perhaps not exactly. If A is (x,y), B is (u,v), then the next point C would be (-x,-y), and D would be (-u,-v). So, the sides are AB, BC, CD, DA.

But in a rhombus, the vectors representing the sides should be equal in magnitude and adjacent sides should be perpendicular? No, wait, in a rhombus, adjacent sides are not necessarily perpendicular, but opposite sides are parallel.

Wait, no, in a rhombus, all sides are congruent, and opposite sides are parallel, but adjacent sides are not necessarily perpendicular. Only in a square are adjacent sides perpendicular.

But in this case, since the diagonals are perpendicular, the rhombus is actually a square? Wait, no, in a rhombus, if the diagonals are perpendicular, it's a rhombus, but a square is a special case of a rhombus with all angles equal.

Wait, no, in a rhombus, the diagonals are perpendicular, but not necessarily equal in length. In a square, the diagonals are equal and perpendicular.

So, in our case, the rhombus is such that its diagonals are perpendicular, but their lengths can vary.

So, back to the problem. Let me consider points A(x,y), B(u,v), C(-x,-y), D(-u,-v). So, the diagonals are AC and BD.

Since diagonals are perpendicular, as I found earlier, (y/x)(v/u) = -1 => yv = -xu.

Each of these points lies on the hyperbola, so:

x²/20 - y²/24 = 1

u²/20 - v²/24 = 1

Now, I need to find BD². BD is the distance between B and D, which are (u,v) and (-u,-v). Wait, no, BD is the diagonal from B to D, so its length is the distance between B(u,v) and D(-u,-v). So, BD² is (u - (-u))² + (v - (-v))² = (2u)^2 + (2v)^2 = 4u² + 4v² = 4(u² + v²).

Similarly, AC² is (2x)^2 + (2y)^2 = 4x² + 4y².

Wait, but in a rhombus, the area can also be expressed as (d1*d2)/2, where d1 and d2 are the lengths of the diagonals. But perhaps that's not directly useful here.

But, since the diagonals are perpendicular, the area is indeed (AC * BD)/2. Alternatively, the area can be calculated as 4 times the area of triangle OAB, where O is the origin.

Wait, let me think. The area of the rhombus is |(AC × BD)|/2, but since AC and BD are vectors, their cross product's magnitude is |AC||BD|sin(theta), but since theta is 90 degrees, sin(theta)=1, so area is |AC||BD|/2.

But maybe another approach is better.

Let me consider the condition that ABCD is a rhombus. So, all sides are equal. So, the distance between A and B equals the distance between B and C, etc.

So, AB² = BC².

Calculating AB²: (x - u)^2 + (y - v)^2.

Calculating BC²: (u - (-x))^2 + (v - (-y))^2 = (u + x)^2 + (v + y)^2.

So, AB² = BC² => (x - u)^2 + (y - v)^2 = (x + u)^2 + (y + v)^2.

Expanding both sides:

Left: x² - 2xu + u² + y² - 2yv + v²

Right: x² + 2xu + u² + y² + 2yv + v²

Subtracting left - right:

(-2xu - 2yv) - (2xu + 2yv) = -4xu -4yv = 0

So, -4xu -4yv = 0 => xu + yv = 0.

Wait, but earlier I had from the slopes that yv = -xu, which is the same as xu + yv = 0. So, that condition is consistent.

So, that condition is satisfied.

Therefore, the only conditions we have so far are:

1. xu + yv = 0.

2. x²/20 - y²/24 = 1

3. u²/20 - v²/24 = 1

So, now, we can think of these as equations in variables x, y, u, v. But perhaps we can parameterize points A and B.

Let me consider parametrizing points on the hyperbola.

A standard parametrization for hyperbola is using hyperbolic functions.

So, for hyperbola x²/a² - y²/b² =1, a parametrization can be x = a secθ, y = b tanθ. Alternatively, using hyperbola functions: x = a cosh t, y = b sinh t.

Similarly for the other branch, but since the points can be on either branch, but since the rhombus is symmetric about the origin, if A is on one branch, C is on the opposite branch.

But for simplicity, let me choose points A and B on the right branch, so x and u are positive.

So, let me parametrize A as (√20 secθ, √24 tanθ) and B as (√20 secφ, √24 tanφ).

So, x = √20 secθ, y = √24 tanθ.

Similarly, u = √20 secφ, v = √24 tanφ.

Now, we have the condition xu + yv = 0.

Substituting:

(√20 secθ)(√20 secφ) + (√24 tanθ)(√24 tanφ) = 0

Simplify:

20 secθ secφ + 24 tanθ tanφ = 0

Divide both sides by 4:

5 secθ secφ + 6 tanθ tanφ = 0

Hmm, let's write this equation:

5 secθ secφ + 6 tanθ tanφ = 0

Let me see if I can express everything in terms of sine and cosine.

Recall that secθ = 1/cosθ, tanθ = sinθ/cosθ.

So,

5/(cosθ cosφ) + 6 (sinθ sinφ)/(cosθ cosφ) = 0

Multiply both sides by cosθ cosφ:

5 + 6 sinθ sinφ = 0

So,

6 sinθ sinφ = -5

Therefore,

sinθ sinφ = -5/6

Interesting.

So, sinθ sinφ = -5/6.

Now, given this, perhaps we can express φ in terms of θ, or find a relation between θ and φ.

But I'm not sure yet. Let's see.

Our goal is to find BD². As I found earlier, BD² is 4(u² + v²). Since u = √20 secφ, v = √24 tanφ, so u² + v² = 20 sec²φ + 24 tan²φ.

Wait, let's compute u² + v²:

u² = 20 sec²φ

v² = 24 tan²φ

So,

u² + v² = 20 sec²φ + 24 tan²φ

But we can express sec²φ in terms of tan²φ: sec²φ = 1 + tan²φ.

So,

u² + v² = 20(1 + tan²φ) + 24 tan²φ = 20 + 44 tan²φ

Therefore, BD² = 4(u² + v²) = 4*(20 + 44 tan²φ) = 80 + 176 tan²φ

Similarly, AC² = 4(x² + y²) = 4*(20 sec²θ + 24 tan²θ) = 80 sec²θ + 96 tan²θ.

But perhaps we can find a relationship between θ and φ.

We have the equation sinθ sinφ = -5/6.

Let me denote sinθ sinφ = -5/6.

We can also consider that perhaps tanθ and tanφ are related. Since we have tanθ and tanφ in the expressions for BD², maybe we can find a relationship.

Alternatively, perhaps express tanφ in terms of tanθ.

But let me think of another approach.

Since u² + v² is part of BD², and we have u² + v² = 20 sec²φ + 24 tan²φ.

Let me compute this expression:

20 sec²φ + 24 tan²φ

= 20(1 + tan²φ) + 24 tan²φ

= 20 + 44 tan²φ

So, BD² = 4*(20 + 44 tan²φ) = 80 + 176 tan²φ.

Similarly, from the hyperbola equation for point B:

u²/20 - v²/24 = 1.

But u² = 20 sec²φ, v² = 24 tan²φ.

So, 20 sec²φ /20 - 24 tan²φ /24 = sec²φ - tan²φ = 1, which is consistent because sec²φ = 1 + tan²φ, so 1 + tan²φ - tan²φ = 1. So that's correct.

So, now, the key equation is sinθ sinφ = -5/6.

I need to relate this to tanφ.

Let me express sinθ in terms of sinφ.

sinθ = (-5)/(6 sinφ)

But sinθ must be between -1 and 1, so |(-5)/(6 sinφ)| <=1 => |5/(6 sinφ)| <=1 => |sinφ| >=5/6.

So, |sinφ| >=5/6.

Therefore, sinφ >=5/6 or sinφ <=-5/6.

Similarly, since sinθ = (-5)/(6 sinφ), then if sinφ >=5/6, sinθ will be negative, and if sinφ <=-5/6, sinθ will be positive.

But since θ and φ can be in different quadrants, perhaps we can just consider sinφ = 5/6 or sinφ = -5/6.

But let's take sinφ = -5/(6 sinθ). Wait, no, from earlier, sinθ sinφ = -5/6.

So, sinθ = (-5)/(6 sinφ).

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps express tanθ in terms of tanφ.

Let me recall that tanθ = sinθ / cosθ.

But maybe we can relate tanθ and tanφ.

Alternatively, perhaps use the relation sinθ sinφ = -5/6.

Let me square both sides:

sin²θ sin²φ = 25/36.

Now, using the identity sin²θ = 1 - cos²θ and sin²φ = 1 - cos²φ.

But I'm not sure if that's helpful.

Alternatively, maybe express cos(theta - phi) and cos(theta + phi) in terms of sinθ sinφ.

Wait, from trigonometry:

cos(theta - phi) = cosθ cosphi + sintheta sinphi

cos(theta + phi) = cosθ cosphi - sintheta sinphi

But from our condition, sintheta sinphi = -5/6.

So,

cos(theta - phi) = cosθ cosphi + (-5/6)

cos(theta + phi) = cosθ cosphi - (-5/6) = cosθ cosphi +5/6

But I'm not sure if that's helpful.

Alternatively, perhaps consider tan(theta) tan(phi).

We have from the product xu + yv =0, which led us to sintheta sinphi = -5/6.

But let me compute tan theta tan phi.

tan theta = sintheta / cos theta,

tan phi = sinphi / cos phi.

So, tan theta tan phi = (sintheta sinphi)/(cos theta cos phi).

We know sintheta sinphi = -5/6.

So, tan theta tan phi = (-5/6)/(cos theta cos phi).

But I don't know cos theta cos phi yet.

Alternatively, perhaps express cos(theta - phi) in terms of sintheta sinphi.

cos(theta - phi) = cos theta cos phi + sintheta sinphi.

We know sintheta sinphi = -5/6.

So,

cos(theta - phi) = cos theta cos phi -5/6.

Similarly,

cos(theta + phi) = cos theta cos phi +5/6.

But without knowing theta and phi, it's difficult to proceed.

Alternatively, perhaps let me denote t = tan(theta), s = tan(phi).

Then, sintheta = t / sqrt(1 + t²), cos theta = 1 / sqrt(1 + t²).

Similarly, sinphi = s / sqrt(1 + s²), cos phi = 1 / sqrt(1 + s²).

So, sintheta sinphi = (t s)/(sqrt(1 + t²) sqrt(1 + s²)) = -5/6.

So,

(t s) / sqrt( (1 + t²)(1 + s²) ) = -5/6.

Squaring both sides:

(t² s²)/( (1 + t²)(1 + s²) ) = 25/36.

Let me rearrange:

36 t² s² =25(1 + t²)(1 + s²)

Expanding RHS:

36 t² s² =25(1 + t² + s² + t² s²)

Bring all terms to left:

36 t² s² -25 -25 t² -25 s² -25 t² s² =0

Factor:

(36 t² s² -25 t² s²) -25 t² -25 s² -25=0

So,

11 t² s² -25 t² -25 s² -25=0

This looks complicated, but maybe I can factor it.

Hmm, perhaps factor as 11 t² s² -25 t² -25 s² -25 =0.

Not obvious.

Alternatively, perhaps let me set t = s, but since sintheta sinphi = -5/6, which is negative, so if t = s, then sintheta sinphi = (ts)/(sqrt(1 + t²) sqrt(1 + t²)) )= t²/(1 + t²) = -5/6.

But t²/(1 + t²) is positive, but RHS is negative, so that can't be. So t cannot equal s.

Alternatively, perhaps set s = k t, where k is a constant.

Let me let s = k t.

Then, substituting into the equation:

36 t² (k² t²) =25(1 + t²)(1 + k² t²)

36 k² t^4 =25(1 + t² + k² t² + k² t^4 )

Expanding RHS:

36 k² t^4 =25 +25 t² +25 k² t² +25 k² t^4

Bring all terms to left:

36 k² t^4 -25 k² t^4 -25 t² -25 k² t² -25=0

Factor:

(36k² -25k²) t^4 -25(1 +k²) t² -25=0

So,

11k² t^4 -25(1 +k²) t² -25=0

Hmm, this is a quadratic in t².

Let me set z = t².

Then,

11 k² z² -25 (1 +k²) z -25 =0

Let me solve for z:

z = [25(1 +k²) ± sqrt(625(1 +k²)^2 + 4*11k²*25)] / (2*11k²)

Compute discriminant:

D = 625(1 +k²)^2 + 1100 k²

= 625(1 + 2k² +k^4 ) + 1100 k²

= 625 + 1250 k² +625 k^4 + 1100k²

= 625 + (1250 +1100)k² +625k^4

=625 +2350k² +625k^4

Factor:

=625k^4 +2350k² +625

=25*(25k^4 +94k² +25)

Hmm, not sure if that's helpful.

Wait, perhaps factor 25k^4 +94k² +25.

Let me try:

Looking for factors of (ak² + b)(ck² + d) = 25k^4 +94k² +25.

ac=25, so a=5, c=5.

(5k² + m)(5k² +n) =25k^4 + (5n +5m)k² + mn.

We need mn=25 and 5(n +m)=94.

So, 5(m +n)=94 => m +n =94/5=18.8, which is not integer. So, perhaps not factorable as such.

So, perhaps it's better to leave it as is.

Therefore,

z = [25(1 +k²) ± sqrt(625(1 +k²)^2 + 1100k²) ] / (22k²)

Hmm, this is getting complicated, and I'm not sure if this substitution is leading me anywhere.

Maybe I need to think differently.

Wait, our goal is to find BD² in terms of tan²φ, which is 80 +176 tan²φ.

So, if I can find the minimum value of BD², that would be the greatest number less than BD² for all such rhombi.

Wait, but the problem says "the greatest real number that is less than BD² for all such rhombi." So, that is, the infimum of BD².

So, perhaps we can find the minimal possible BD² over all possible rhombi satisfying the conditions, and then the answer is the infimum, which is the minimal BD².

Wait, but the problem says "the greatest real number that is less than BD² for all such rhombi". So, that would be the infimum of BD².

So, perhaps I need to find the minimum possible value of BD².

So, perhaps I can express BD² in terms of a single variable and find its minimum.

Since BD² =80 +176 tan²φ, and from earlier, sintheta sinphi =-5/6.

But tan²φ = (sin²phi)/(1 - sin²phi).

We have sintheta sinphi = -5/6.

So, let me denote s = sinphi.

Then, sintheta = (-5)/(6s).

But since sintheta must satisfy |sintheta| <=1, so |(-5)/(6s)| <=1 => |5/(6s)| <=1 => |s| >=5/6.

So, s >=5/6 or s <=-5/6.

So, let me set s = sinphi, so |s| >=5/6.

Then, tan²phi = (s²)/(1 -s²).

So, BD² =80 +176*(s²)/(1 -s²) =80 + [176 s²]/(1 -s²).

Now, let me define f(s) =80 + [176 s²]/(1 -s²), where |s| >=5/6.

We need to find the minimum of f(s) over |s| >=5/6.

But since the function is even in s (symmetric about s=0), we can consider s >=5/6, and then the result will be same for s <=-5/6.

So, let me set s >=5/6.

So, f(s) =80 + [176 s²]/(1 -s²).

We can write 1 -s² = (1 -s)(1 +s). Since s >=5/6, 1 -s is positive but less than 1/6.

But let me compute f(s):

f(s) =80 + [176 s²]/(1 -s²)

Let me write this as:

f(s) =80 +176 s²/(1 -s²) =80 +176 [s²/(1 -s²)]

Let me make substitution t = s², so t >= (5/6)^2 =25/36.

Then,

f(t) =80 +176 t/(1 -t)

So, f(t) =80 + [176 t]/(1 -t)

We can write this as:

f(t) =80 +176*( -1 +1/(1 -t) )

Because note that t/(1 -t) = -1 +1/(1 -t).

Let me verify:

t/(1 -t) = (-1)(1 - t) +1)/(1 -t) = [ - (1 -t) +1 ]/(1 -t) = (-1 +t +1)/(1 -t) = t/(1 -t). So, yes.

So,

f(t) =80 +176*(-1 +1/(1 -t)) =80 -176 +176/(1 -t) = -96 +176/(1 -t)

So, f(t) = -96 +176/(1 -t)

Now, since t >=25/36, so 1 -t <=1 -25/36=11/36.

So, 1/(1 -t) >=36/11.

So, f(t) = -96 +176/(1 -t) >= -96 +176*(36/11)

Compute 176*(36)/11:

176/11=16, so 16*36=576.

So, f(t) >= -96 +576=480

Similarly, as t increases, 1 -t decreases, so 1/(1 -t) increases, so f(t) increases beyond 480.

Therefore, the minimal value of f(t) is 480, achieved when t is minimal, i.e., t=25/36.

Therefore, the minimal BD² is 480.

Hence, the greatest real number less than BD² for all such rhombi is 480.

But wait, let me verify that. Because when t=25/36, s=5/6.

So, sinphi=5/6, which is the minimal t.

So, plugging back into f(t):

f(t)= -96 +176/(1 -25/36)= -96 +176/(11/36)= -96 +176*(36/11)= -96 +16*36= -96 +576=480.

Yes, correct.

Therefore, the minimal BD² is 480, so the greatest number less than BD² for all rhombi is 480.

Wait, but is 480 the minimal BD²? Because if BD² can be as low as 480, then 480 is the infimum. So, the problem asks for the greatest real number less than BD² for all such rhombi. So, the infimum is 480, so the answer is 480.

Wait, but is there any rhombus where BD² is exactly 480? Yes, when t=25/36, so s=5/6, so sinphi=5/6.

So, when phi is such that sinphi=5/6, then BD²=480.

Therefore, 480 is attainable, so the infimum is 480, and thus the greatest real number less than BD² for all rhombi is 480.

Wait, but the problem says "the greatest real number that is less than BD² for all such rhombi." So, it's the infimum.

So, the infimum is 480, so 480 is the greatest lower bound. Therefore, the answer is 480.

But to ensure I didn't make a mistake, let me check the substitution again.

We had f(t) = -96 +176/(1 -t)

Since t >=25/36,

1 -t <=11/36,

Thus, 1/(1 -t) >=36/11,

So, 176/(1 -t) >=176*(36/11)=576,

Hence, f(t)>= -96 +576=480.

Yes, correct.

So, BD² >=480.

Thus, the minimal possible BD² is 480, so the greatest real number less than BD² for all such rhombi is 480.

Therefore, the answer is 480.

**Final Answer**
\boxed{480}


--- Final Answer Content ---


Given the hyperbola \(\frac{x^2}{20} - \frac{y^2}{24} = 1\) and a rhombus \(ABCD\) inscribed in it with diagonals intersecting at the origin, we need to find the greatest real number less than \(BD^2\) for all such rhombi.

1. **Hyperbola and Rhombus Properties**:
   - The hyperbola is centered at the origin with \(a^2 = 20\) and \(b^2 = 24\).
   - The rhombus \(ABCD\) has diagonals intersecting at the origin, implying symmetry about the origin.
   - Points \(A, B, C, D\) on the hyperbola satisfy the equation \(\frac{x^2}{20} - \frac{y^2}{24} = 1\).

2. **Diagonals and Slopes**:
   - The diagonals \(AC\) and \(BD\) are perpendicular, leading to the condition \((y/x)(v/u) = -1\) or \(yv = -xu\).

3. **Parametrization**:
   - Points \(A\) and \(B\) can be parametrized using hyperbolic functions: \(A(\sqrt{20} \sec \theta, \sqrt{24} \tan \theta)\) and \(B(\sqrt{20} \sec \phi, \sqrt{24} \tan \phi)\).
   - The condition \(xu + yv = 0\) translates to \(5 \sec \theta \sec \phi + 6 \tan \theta \tan \phi = 0\).

4. **Simplifying Conditions**:
   - Using trigonometric identities, we find \(\sin \theta \sin \phi = -\frac{5}{6}\).

5. **Expression for \(BD^2\)**:
   - \(BD^2 = 4(u^2 + v^2)\).
   - Substituting \(u = \sqrt{20} \sec \phi\) and \(v = \sqrt{24} \tan \phi\), we get \(BD^2 = 80 + 176 \tan^2 \phi\).

6. **Minimizing \(BD^2\)**:
   - Using the condition \(\sin \phi = \frac{5}{6}\) or \(\sin \phi = -\frac{5}{6}\), we find the minimum value of \(\tan^2 \phi\).
   - The minimum value of \(BD^2\) is found to be 480 when \(\tan^2 \phi\) is minimized.

Thus, the greatest real number less than \(BD^2\) for all such rhombi is \(\boxed{480}\).
