Okay, so I'm trying to solve this probability problem about Jen entering a lottery. Let me try to parse the problem step by step.

Jen picks 4 distinct numbers from the set S = {1,2,3,...,10}. Then, 4 numbers are randomly chosen from S. She wins a prize if at least two of her numbers are among the randomly chosen 4. She wins the grand prize if all four of her numbers are chosen.

The question is about finding the probability that she wins the grand prize given that she won a prize. This is a conditional probability problem. So, I need to find P(Grand Prize | Prize), which is equal to P(Grand Prize and Prize) / P(Prize). But since Grand Prize is a subset of Prize (because if she wins grand prize, she definitely won a prize), this simplifies to P(Grand Prize) / P(Prize).

So, I need to compute two probabilities: the probability that Jen wins the grand prize, and the probability that she wins any prize.

Let me think about how to compute these.

First, the total number of ways to choose 4 numbers from 10 is C(10,4), where C(n,k) is the combination formula. So, C(10,4) = 210. That's the total possible number of lottery draws.

Jen is picking 4 specific numbers, so let's denote her numbers as set A, which has 4 elements.

First, the probability of the grand prize: this is the probability that all 4 numbers she picked are chosen in the lottery. So, how many favorable outcomes are there for the grand prize? Only 1, because the lottery must choose exactly Jen's 4 numbers. So, the probability P(Grand Prize) is 1 / C(10,4) = 1/210.

Wait, no, no. Wait a second. Wait, no, the number of ways the lottery can choose 4 numbers is C(10,4) = 210. So, the probability of the lottery selecting exactly her 4 numbers is 1/210. That makes sense.

Now, the probability of her winning a prize is the probability that at least two of her numbers are selected. So, this would include cases where exactly two, exactly three, or exactly four of her numbers are selected.

So, to compute P(Prize), we can calculate the number of favorable outcomes where at least two of her four numbers are selected.

Alternatively, it's easier sometimes to compute the complement: the probability of NOT winning a prize, which is the probability that fewer than two of her numbers are selected, i.e., zero or one of her numbers are selected. So, P(Prize) = 1 - P(zero or one of her numbers are selected).

Let me compute that.

First, the total number of possible lottery draws is C(10,4) = 210.

The number of lottery draws where zero of Jen's numbers are selected: This means all four numbers are selected from the remaining 6 numbers (since 10 - 4 = 6). So, the number of such draws is C(6,4) = 15.

The number of lottery draws where exactly one of Jen's numbers is selected: We choose 1 number from her 4, and the remaining 3 from the other 6. So, the number here is C(4,1)*C(6,3) = 4 * 20 = 80.

So, the total number of draws where she doesn't win a prize is 15 + 80 = 95.

Therefore, the number of draws where she wins a prize is total draws minus non-winning draws: 210 - 95 = 115.

Wait, let me confirm. Let me calculate it directly.

Number of favorable draws for at least two matches:

- Exactly two matches: C(4,2)*C(6,2) = 6 * 15 = 90.

- Exactly three matches: C(4,3)*C(6,1) = 4 * 6 = 24.

- Exactly four matches: C(4,4)*C(6,0) = 1 * 1 = 1.

Adding these up: 90 + 24 + 1 = 115. So, that's correct.

Therefore, P(Prize) = 115 / 210.

Simplify that: 115 divides by 5, 115/5 =23. 210/5=42. So, 23/42. So, P(Prize) is 23/42.

Wait, hold on: 115 divided by 5 is 23. 210 divided by 5 is 42. So, 23/42, yes.

Now, P(Grand Prize) is 1/210.

So, the conditional probability P(Grand Prize | Prize) is (1/210) / (115/210) = 1 / 115.

Wait, that seems a bit low, but let me check.

Wait, 1/210 divided by (115/210) is indeed (1/210) * (210/115) = 1/115.

So, that would be the probability. So, 1/115 is the probability, which is already in lowest terms since 1 and 115 are coprime (115 factors into 5*23, and 1 shares no common factors with either).

Therefore, m is 1 and n is 115, so m + n is 1 + 115 = 116.

Wait, but hold on, let me think again. Is the number of Prize cases 115?

Wait, earlier I had 115 as the number of favorable cases, which is correct. So, P(Prize) is 115/210, which simplifies to 23/42. But when I compute the conditional probability, it's 1/210 divided by 115/210 = 1/115. So, yes, that seems correct.

Alternatively, another way to think about it: given that she has won a prize, which is 115 possible draws, how many of those are the grand prize? Only 1.

Therefore, the conditional probability is 1/115.

So, m is 1, n is 115, so m + n is 116. So, the answer is 116.

Wait, but I just want to make sure I didn't make any mistake in computing the number of Prize cases.

So, Prize = at least two numbers. So, exactly two: C(4,2)*C(6,2) = 6*15=90.

Exactly three: C(4,3)*C(6,1)=4*6=24.

Exactly four: C(4,4)*C(6,0)=1*1=1.

Total: 90 +24 +1 = 115. So that's correct.

Therefore, I think my calculation is correct.

To solve the problem, we need to find the probability that Jen wins the grand prize given that she won a prize. This is a conditional probability problem, where we compute \( P(\text{Grand Prize} | \text{Prize}) \).

First, we determine the total number of ways to choose 4 numbers from the set \( S = \{1, 2, 3, \ldots, 10\} \), which is \( \binom{10}{4} = 210 \).

**Calculating \( P(\text{Grand Prize}) \):**
- The grand prize occurs when all 4 of Jen's numbers are chosen. There is only 1 such combination.
- Thus, \( P(\text{Grand Prize}) = \frac{1}{210} \).

**Calculating \( P(\text{Prize}) \):**
- Winning a prize means at least two of Jen's numbers are chosen. We can compute this by subtracting the probability of not winning a prize (i.e., choosing fewer than two of her numbers) from 1.
- The number of ways to choose 0 of Jen's numbers: \( \binom{6}{4} = 15 \).
- The number of ways to choose 1 of Jen's numbers: \( \binom{4}{1} \times \binom{6}{3} = 4 \times 20 = 80 \).
- Total non-winning combinations: \( 15 + 80 = 95 \).
- Winning combinations: \( 210 - 95 = 115 \).
- Thus, \( P(\text{Prize}) = \frac{115}{210} = \frac{23}{42} \).

**Calculating the conditional probability:**
\[
P(\text{Grand Prize} | \text{Prize}) = \frac{P(\text{Grand Prize})}{P(\text{Prize})} = \frac{\frac{1}{210}}{\frac{115}{210}} = \frac{1}{115}.
\]

The fraction \( \frac{1}{115} \) is already in its simplest form, so \( m = 1 \) and \( n = 115 \). Therefore, \( m + n = 1 + 115 = 116 \).

The final answer is \(\boxed{116}\).
