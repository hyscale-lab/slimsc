Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the product of two real numbers x and y, both greater than 1. The given conditions are that the logarithm of y^x with base x is 10, and the logarithm of x^{4y} with base y is also 10. Hmm, that's interesting. Let me try to unpack this step by step.

First, I remember that logarithms can be converted to exponential form. Maybe that would help me here. So, the first equation is log_x(y^x) = 10. If I rewrite this, it means that x raised to the power of 10 equals y^x. Wait, no, actually, the definition of logarithm says that log_b(a) = c is equivalent to b^c = a. So, in this case, log_x(y^x) = 10 implies that x^10 = y^x. Let me write that down as equation (1): x^10 = y^x.

Similarly, the second equation is log_y(x^{4y}) = 10. Following the same logic, this should mean that y^10 = x^{4y}. Let me write that as equation (2): y^10 = x^{4y}.

Now I have two equations:

1. x^10 = y^x
2. y^10 = x^{4y}

I need to find x and y such that both these equations hold, and then find their product xy.

Hmm, this seems a bit tricky. Maybe I can take logarithms on both sides to make it easier to handle the exponents.

Starting with equation (1): x^10 = y^x.

Take the natural logarithm (ln) of both sides:

ln(x^10) = ln(y^x)

Using the logarithm power rule, ln(a^b) = b ln(a), so:

10 ln(x) = x ln(y)

Similarly, for equation (2): y^10 = x^{4y}

Take ln of both sides:

ln(y^10) = ln(x^{4y})

Again, applying the power rule:

10 ln(y) = 4y ln(x)

So now I have two equations:

3. 10 ln(x) = x ln(y)
4. 10 ln(y) = 4y ln(x)

Hmm, these look like simultaneous equations in terms of ln(x) and ln(y). Maybe I can solve for one variable in terms of the other.

Let me denote a = ln(x) and b = ln(y). Then, the equations become:

3. 10a = x b
4. 10b = 4y a

But wait, x and y are related to a and b as well because x = e^a and y = e^b. So, substituting x = e^a and y = e^b into equations (3) and (4):

Equation 3 becomes: 10a = e^a * b
Equation 4 becomes: 10b = 4e^b * a

So now I have:

5. 10a = b e^a
6. 10b = 4a e^b

This looks a bit complicated, but maybe I can find a relationship between a and b.

Let me see equation 5: 10a = b e^a => b = (10a) / e^a

Similarly, equation 6: 10b = 4a e^b => b = (4a e^b)/10 = (2a e^b)/5

Now, I can set the two expressions for b equal to each other:

(10a) / e^a = (2a e^b) / 5

Let me cancel out a from both sides, assuming a ≠ 0, which is reasonable since x > 1, so a = ln(x) > 0.

So, 10 / e^a = (2 e^b) / 5

Multiply both sides by e^a:

10 = (2 e^b e^a) / 5

Wait, because I multiplied both sides by e^a, which gives:

10 = (2 e^{a + b}) /5

Wait, that doesn't look right. Let me double-check.

Wait, I had:

(10a)/e^a = (2a e^b)/5

Divide both sides by a (a ≠ 0):

10 / e^a = 2 e^b /5

Multiply both sides by e^a:

10 = (2 e^b /5) * e^a

Which is 10 = (2 e^{a + b}) /5

Multiply both sides by 5:

50 = 2 e^{a + b}

Divide by 2:

25 = e^{a + b}

So, taking natural log on both sides:

ln(25) = a + b

So, a + b = ln(25). That's equation (7).

Now, from equation (5): b = (10a)/e^a

And from equation (6): b = (2a e^b)/5

Wait, maybe we can express a + b in terms of a. Let's see.

We know that b = (10a)/(e^a), so plugging into a + b:

a + (10a)/(e^a) = ln(25)

So, a [1 + 10/(e^a)] = ln(25)

Hmm, that's a transcendental equation. Maybe it's difficult to solve algebraically. Perhaps I can make a substitution or another approach.

Alternatively, perhaps I can find a relationship between x and y from equations (1) and (2).

From equation (1): x^10 = y^x

From equation (2): y^10 = x^{4y}

Let me take the ratio of these two equations:

(x^10) / (y^10) = (y^x) / (x^{4y})

Simplify the left side: (x/y)^10

The right side: y^x / x^{4y} = y^x * x^{-4y}

Hmm, not sure if that's helpful. Maybe write both sides in terms of exponents.

Alternatively, let me write both equations in terms of exponents.

Equation (1): x^10 = y^x => y = x^{10/x}

Equation (2): y^10 = x^{4y} => y = x^{(4y)/10} = x^{(2y)/5}

So, from equation (1), y = x^{10/x}, from equation (2), y = x^{(2y)/5}

So, since both equal y, set them equal:

x^{10/x} = x^{(2y)/5}

Since the bases are the same and x > 1, we can set the exponents equal:

10/x = (2y)/5

Solving for y:

Multiply both sides by x: 10 = (2y x)/5

Multiply both sides by 5: 50 = 2xy

Divide by 2: 25 = xy

Wait, that's the product we're supposed to find! So, xy =25.

Wait, that was much simpler. So, I think I might have overcomplicated it earlier by taking logarithms and introducing a and b.

So, let me recap.

From equation (1): x^10 = y^x => y = x^{10/x}

From equation (2): y^10 = x^{4y} => y = x^{(4y)/10} = x^{(2y)/5}

Setting equal the two expressions for y:

x^{10/x} = x^{(2y)/5}

Since x >1, the exponents must be equal:

10/x = (2y)/5

Solve for y:

10/x = (2y)/5

Multiply both sides by 5x: 50 = 2xy

Divide by 2: 25 = xy

So, the product xy is 25.

Wait, that was straightforward. So, maybe I didn't need to go through the substitution with a and b. I should have thought to express y from both equations and set them equal earlier.

But just to make sure, let's verify if this is consistent.

So, if xy =25, then y =25/x.

Substitute into equation (1): x^10 = y^x = (25/x)^x

So, x^10 = (25^x)/(x^x)

Multiply both sides by x^x:

x^{10 + x} =25^x

Take natural log:

(10 + x) ln(x) = x ln(25)

So, 10 ln(x) +x ln(x) =x ln(25)

Hmm, 10 ln(x) =x (ln(25) - ln(x)) 

But earlier, from equation (3), 10 ln(x) =x ln(y). Since y =25/x, ln(y) = ln(25) - ln(x). So, 10 ln(x) =x (ln(25) - ln(x)), which is consistent.

Similarly, let's check equation (2):

y^10 = x^{4y}

With y=25/x, substitute:

(25/x)^10 = x^{4*(25/x)} = x^{100/x}

Left side: (25^10)/(x^10)

So, (25^10)/(x^10) =x^{100/x}

Multiply both sides by x^10:

25^10 =x^{100/x +10}

Take natural logs:

10 ln(25) = (100/x +10) ln(x)

Hmm, which is 10 ln(25) = (100 +10x)/x * ln(x)

Which is 10 ln(25) = (100 +10x) ln(x)/x

Which can be written as 10 ln(25) =10 ln(x) + (100 ln(x))/x

Wait, from equation (3): 10 ln(x) =x ln(y) =x (ln(25/x))=x (ln(25)-ln(x))

So, 10 ln(x) =x ln(25) -x ln(x)

So, x ln(x) =x ln(25) -10 ln(x)

Hmm, this seems a bit involved. Let me see if I can find x.

Alternatively, maybe I can assume that x and y are integers? Since 25 is an integer, perhaps x and y are integers. Let me try to see if x and y are integers.

Given that xy=25, and x and y>1, possible integer pairs are (5,5) since 5*5=25.

Let me test x=5 and y=5.

Equation (1): log_5(5^5) = log_5(3125) =5, but wait, we need it to be 10. So that's not matching.

Hmm, so x and y are not 5 and5. Wait, maybe x=25 and y=1? No, because y must be greater than1.

Wait, maybe x= sqrt(25)=5, but that's same as before.

Alternatively, perhaps x= something else.

Wait, perhaps I can find x by going back to the equation after substitution.

We have from equation (1): 10 ln(x) = x ln(y)

But y=25/x, so ln(y)=ln(25) - ln(x)

So, 10 ln(x)=x (ln(25) - ln(x))

Which is 10 ln(x) =x ln(25) -x ln(x)

Bring all terms to one side:

10 ln(x) +x ln(x) -x ln(25)=0

Factor ln(x):

ln(x) (10 +x ) -x ln(25)=0

Wait, but not sure. Alternatively, arrange terms:

10 ln(x) +x ln(x) =x ln(25)

So, ln(x) (10 +x ) =x ln(25)

Then, ln(x) = [x ln(25)]/(x +10)

Hmm, maybe I can let t =x, so ln(t) = [t ln(25)]/(t +10)

Not sure if that helps. Let me see if I can express this as a function and see if it has a solution.

Let me define f(t) = ln(t) - [t ln(25)]/(t +10)

We need to find t>1 where f(t)=0.

Let me compute f(5):

ln(5) - [5 ln(25)]/(5 +10)

ln(5) ≈1.609

ln(25)=ln(5^2)=2 ln(5)=2*1.609=3.219

So,

f(5)=1.609 - [5 *3.219]/15

=1.609 - (16.095)/15

=1.609 -1.073=0.536>0

f(5) is positive.

Now, try t=10:

ln(10)≈2.303

[10 *3.219]/(20)= (32.19)/20=1.6095

f(10)=2.303 -1.6095≈0.693>0

Still positive.

t=15:

ln(15)≈2.708

[15 *3.219]/25=48.285/25≈1.9314

f(15)=2.708 -1.9314≈0.7766>0

Hmm, still positive.

t=20:

ln(20)≈2.996

[20*3.219]/30≈64.38/30≈2.146

f(20)=2.996 -2.146≈0.85>0

Still positive. Wait, but as t increases, ln(t) increases, but [t ln(25)]/(t+10) approaches ln(25)≈3.219. So, as t approaches infinity, ln(t) increases without bound, so f(t) tends to infinity.

Wait, but at t=5, f(t)=0.536, and it's increasing as t increases.

Wait, maybe I need to check lower t.

Wait, t has to be greater than1, but let's try t=2.

ln(2)=0.693

[2 *3.219]/12≈6.438/12≈0.5365

f(2)=0.693 -0.5365≈0.1565>0

t=3:

ln(3)=1.0986

[3*3.219]/13≈9.657/13≈0.743

f(3)=1.0986 -0.743≈0.355>0

t=4:

ln(4)=1.386

[4 *3.219]/14≈12.876/14≈0.9197

f(4)=1.386 -0.9197≈0.466>0

t=1:

ln(1)=0

[1 *3.219]/11≈0.2926

f(1)=0 -0.2926≈-0.2926<0

Wait, so between t=1 and t=2, f(t) goes from negative to positive. So, there is a root between 1 and2.

Wait, but x>1, so x must be in (1,2). Hmm, but then y=25/x would be greater than12.5.

Wait, but earlier, when I assumed x and y are integers, x=5 and y=5 didn't work, but maybe x is not an integer.

But regardless, I can see that the product is 25, so xy=25. So, perhaps the answer is 25, regardless of specific x and y.

Wait, actually, the problem just asks for xy, not individual x and y. So, perhaps I don't need to find x and y. Because from the equations, we derived that xy=25.

Wait, but let me make sure.

Earlier, by expressing y from both equations and setting them equal, I found that xy=25. So, regardless of the specific x and y, their product is 25.

So, perhaps the answer is 25.

Alternatively, to confirm, I can test with x and y such that xy=25.

Suppose, for instance, x= something and y=25/x, like x=10, y=2.5.

Check equation (1): log_x(y^x)=log_10((2.5)^10)=?

Wait, (2.5)^10=9536.743, so log_10(9536.743)=3.979 approx, which is not 10. So, that doesn't satisfy. Hmm.

Wait, but that's because when I took x=10, y=2.5, but they don't satisfy the original equations.

So, perhaps the correct x and y are not integers but specific numbers such that their product is 25, and they satisfy the two logarithmic equations.

But since the problem only asks for xy, which we found to be 25, perhaps that's sufficient.

Alternatively, perhaps I can accept that xy=25, based on the earlier derivation.

So, the answer is 25.

The given problem involves finding the product \( xy \) where \( x \) and \( y \) are real numbers greater than 1, satisfying the equations \( \log_x(y^x) = 10 \) and \( \log_y(x^{4y}) = 10 \).

First, we convert the logarithmic equations to their exponential forms:
1. \( \log_x(y^x) = 10 \) implies \( x^{10} = y^x \).
2. \( \log_y(x^{4y}) = 10 \) implies \( y^{10} = x^{4y} \).

From the first equation, express \( y \) in terms of \( x \):
\[ y = x^{10/x} \]

From the second equation, express \( y \) in another form:
\[ y = x^{(2y)/5} \]

Equating the two expressions for \( y \):
\[ x^{10/x} = x^{(2y)/5} \]

Since the bases are equal and \( x > 1 \), the exponents must be equal:
\[ \frac{10}{x} = \frac{2y}{5} \]

Solving for \( y \):
\[ 10 \cdot 5 = 2xy \]
\[ 50 = 2xy \]
\[ xy = 25 \]

Thus, the product \( xy \) is \( \boxed{25} \).
