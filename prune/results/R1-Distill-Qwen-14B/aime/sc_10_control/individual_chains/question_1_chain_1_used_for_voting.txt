Alright, so I've got this problem with logarithms and three variables, x, y, and z. It's a system of equations, and I need to find the absolute value of log base 2 of x^4 y^3 z^2. Then, express that as a fraction m/n where m and n are coprime, and find m + n. Hmm, okay, let's break this down.

The equations given are:

1. log₂(x / (y z)) = 1/2
2. log₂(y / (x z)) = 1/3
3. log₂(z / (x y)) = 1/4

So, all of these are logarithms base 2. Since logarithms can be tricky, maybe I can rewrite each equation in exponential form to make it simpler. Remember, log_b(a) = c is equivalent to b^c = a.

Let's rewrite each equation:

1. 2^(1/2) = x / (y z)
2. 2^(1/3) = y / (x z)
3. 2^(1/4) = z / (x y)

Simplify the exponents:

1. sqrt(2) = x / (y z) → equation (1)
2. 2^(1/3) = y / (x z) → equation (2)
3. 2^(1/4) = z / (x y) → equation (3)

Hmm, now I have three equations with variables in the numerator and denominator. Maybe I can express x, y, z in terms of each other. Let me see.

From equation (1): x = sqrt(2) * y z.

From equation (2): y = 2^(1/3) * x z.

From equation (3): z = 2^(1/4) * x y.

Hmm, substituting might get messy, but let's try to express everything in terms of one variable. Let's see if I can substitute x from equation (1) into equation (2), then into equation (3).

From equation (1), x = sqrt(2) y z. Let's plug this into equation (2):

y = 2^(1/3) * (sqrt(2) y z) * z = 2^(1/3) * sqrt(2) * y z^2.

Wait, so y = [2^(1/3) * 2^(1/2)] y z^2.

Simplify the exponents: 2^(1/3 + 1/2) = 2^(5/6). So,

y = 2^(5/6) y z^2.

Hmm, I can divide both sides by y (since y is positive, so it's not zero):

1 = 2^(5/6) z^2.

So, z^2 = 1 / 2^(5/6) = 2^(-5/6).

Taking square roots:

z = 2^(-5/12). Because sqrt(2^(-5/6)) = 2^(-5/12). Since z is positive, we take the positive root.

Okay, so z is 2^(-5/12). Let me note that down.

Now, let's go back to equation (1): x = sqrt(2) * y z.

We have z = 2^(-5/12), so let's plug that in:

x = 2^(1/2) * y * 2^(-5/12) = y * 2^(1/2 - 5/12).

Compute the exponent: 1/2 is 6/12, so 6/12 -5/12 = 1/12.

So, x = y * 2^(1/12). So, x = y * 2^(1/12). Let's keep that in mind.

Now, let's go to equation (2): y = 2^(1/3) * x z.

We already have x in terms of y, so substitute x:

y = 2^(1/3) * (y * 2^(1/12)) * z.

We also know z is 2^(-5/12), so plug that in:

y = 2^(1/3) * y * 2^(1/12) * 2^(-5/12).

Combine the exponents:

2^(1/3) * 2^(1/12 -5/12) = 2^(1/3) * 2^(-4/12) = 2^(1/3) * 2^(-1/3) = 2^(0) = 1.

So, y = 1 * y → y = y.

Wait, that just gives an identity. Hmm, that doesn't help me find y. Maybe I need to try a different approach.

Alternatively, maybe I can express all variables in terms of each other and then set up a system.

We have:

From equation (1): x = 2^(1/2) y z → equation (1a)

From equation (2): y = 2^(1/3) x z → equation (2a)

From equation (3): z = 2^(1/4) x y → equation (3a)

Let me substitute equation (1a) into equation (2a):

y = 2^(1/3) * (2^(1/2) y z) * z = 2^(1/3 + 1/2) y z^2.

Which is similar to what I did earlier, leading to z^2 = 2^(-5/6), so z=2^(-5/12). So, maybe I can now substitute z into equation (3a) to find x and y.

From equation (3a): z = 2^(1/4) x y.

We know z = 2^(-5/12), so:

2^(-5/12) = 2^(1/4) x y.

Simplify 2^(1/4) as 2^(3/12), so:

2^(-5/12) = 2^(3/12) x y → Divide both sides by 2^(3/12):

2^(-5/12 - 3/12) = x y → 2^(-8/12) = x y → 2^(-2/3) = x y.

So, x y = 2^(-2/3). Let's note that as equation (4).

From equation (1a): x = 2^(1/2) y z.

We know z = 2^(-5/12), so:

x = 2^(1/2) * y * 2^(-5/12) = y * 2^(1/2 -5/12).

Compute exponent: 1/2 = 6/12, so 6/12 -5/12 =1/12.

So, x = y * 2^(1/12). So, x = y * 2^(1/12). Let's call this equation (5).

Now, from equation (4): x y = 2^(-2/3).

But x is y * 2^(1/12), so substitute:

(y * 2^(1/12)) * y = 2^(-2/3) → y^2 * 2^(1/12) = 2^(-2/3).

So, y^2 = 2^(-2/3) / 2^(1/12) = 2^(-2/3 -1/12) = 2^(-8/12 -1/12) = 2^(-9/12) = 2^(-3/4).

So, y^2 = 2^(-3/4).

Take square root: y = 2^(-3/8), since y is positive.

So, y = 2^(-3/8).

Now, from equation (5): x = y * 2^(1/12) = 2^(-3/8) * 2^(1/12) = 2^(-3/8 + 1/12).

Convert to common denominator, which is 24:

-3/8 = -9/24, 1/12 = 2/24. So, total exponent: -9/24 + 2/24 = (-7)/24.

So, x = 2^(-7/24).

Wait, let me check that calculation again.

Wait, 2^(-3/8) * 2^(1/12) = 2^(-3/8 +1/12).

Compute the exponents:

-3/8 is equal to -9/24, and 1/12 is 2/24.

So, adding them: -9/24 + 2/24 = -7/24.

Yes, so x = 2^(-7/24).

And we already found z = 2^(-5/12).

Let me write down all variables:

x = 2^(-7/24)

y = 2^(-3/8)

z = 2^(-5/12)

Now, the problem asks for |log₂(x^4 y^3 z^2)|.

So, let's compute x^4 y^3 z^2.

Expressed in exponents:

x^4 = (2^(-7/24))^4 = 2^(-7/24 *4) = 2^(-7/6)

y^3 = (2^(-3/8))^3 = 2^(-9/8)

z^2 = (2^(-5/12))^2 = 2^(-10/12) = 2^(-5/6)

Multiply them together:

x^4 y^3 z^2 = 2^(-7/6) * 2^(-9/8) * 2^(-5/6).

Add the exponents:

-7/6 -9/8 -5/6.

Let me get a common denominator for 6 and 8, which is 24.

Convert each fraction:

-7/6 = -28/24

-9/8 = -27/24

-5/6 = -20/24

Add them up: (-28 -27 -20)/24 = (-75)/24.

Simplify: -75/24 = -25/8.

So, x^4 y^3 z^2 = 2^(-25/8).

Therefore, log₂(x^4 y^3 z^2) = log₂(2^(-25/8)) = -25/8.

Taking absolute value: | -25/8 | = 25/8.

So, the value is 25/8, which is already in lowest terms since 25 and 8 are coprime (factors of 25 are 1,5,25; factors of 8 are 1,2,4,8; only common factor is 1).

Thus, m =25, n=8. So, m + n = 25 +8=33.

I think that's the answer. Let me just double-check all steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake.

First, converting the logs to exponents was correct.

Then, solving for z correctly led to z =2^(-5/12). Then, substituting into equation (1a) gave x in terms of y, which was x = y *2^(1/12).

Then, using equation (3a) to get x y =2^(-2/3). Substituting x from equation (5) into this gave y^2 =2^(-3/4), so y=2^(-3/8). Then x=2^(-3/8)*2^(1/12)=2^(-7/24).

Calculating exponents for x^4 y^3 z^2: each variable's exponent was multiplied by their respective power (4,3,2), leading to exponents of -7/6, -9/8, -5/6.

Adding these gave -25/8, so log₂ is -25/8, absolute value is 25/8. So, 25 +8=33.

To solve the given system of logarithmic equations, we start by converting each equation into its exponential form:

1. \(\log_2\left(\frac{x}{yz}\right) = \frac{1}{2} \implies \frac{x}{yz} = 2^{1/2}\)
2. \(\log_2\left(\frac{y}{xz}\right) = \frac{1}{3} \implies \frac{y}{xz} = 2^{1/3}\)
3. \(\log_2\left(\frac{z}{xy}\right) = \frac{1}{4} \implies \frac{z}{xy} = 2^{1/4}\)

From equation 1, we express \(x\) as:
\[ x = 2^{1/2} yz \]

From equation 2, we express \(y\) as:
\[ y = 2^{1/3} xz \]

From equation 3, we express \(z\) as:
\[ z = 2^{1/4} xy \]

Substituting \(x = 2^{1/2} yz\) into equation 2:
\[ y = 2^{1/3} (2^{1/2} yz) z = 2^{5/6} yz^2 \]
Dividing both sides by \(y\) and solving for \(z^2\):
\[ 1 = 2^{5/6} z^2 \implies z^2 = 2^{-5/6} \implies z = 2^{-5/12} \]

Substituting \(z = 2^{-5/12}\) into equation 1:
\[ x = 2^{1/2} y \cdot 2^{-5/12} = y \cdot 2^{1/12} \]

Using equation 3 with \(z = 2^{-5/12}\):
\[ 2^{-5/12} = 2^{1/4} xy \implies xy = 2^{-2/3} \]

Substituting \(x = y \cdot 2^{1/12}\) into \(xy = 2^{-2/3}\):
\[ y \cdot 2^{1/12} \cdot y = 2^{-2/3} \implies y^2 = 2^{-2/3} \cdot 2^{-1/12} = 2^{-3/4} \implies y = 2^{-3/8} \]

Then, \(x = 2^{-3/8} \cdot 2^{1/12} = 2^{-7/24}\).

Now, we compute \(x^4 y^3 z^2\):
\[
x^4 = (2^{-7/24})^4 = 2^{-7/6}, \quad y^3 = (2^{-3/8})^3 = 2^{-9/8}, \quad z^2 = (2^{-5/12})^2 = 2^{-5/6}
\]
\[
x^4 y^3 z^2 = 2^{-7/6} \cdot 2^{-9/8} \cdot 2^{-5/6} = 2^{-25/8}
\]
Taking the logarithm base 2:
\[
\log_2(x^4 y^3 z^2) = -\frac{25}{8}
\]
The absolute value is \(\left| -\frac{25}{8} \right| = \frac{25}{8}\).

Thus, \(m = 25\) and \(n = 8\), so \(m + n = 33\).

\(\boxed{33}\)
