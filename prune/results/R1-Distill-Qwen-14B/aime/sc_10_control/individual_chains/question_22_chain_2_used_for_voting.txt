Okay, so I have this geometry problem here about a convex equilateral hexagon. All pairs of opposite sides are parallel, and the triangle formed by extending AB, CD, and EF has sides of lengths 200, 240, and 300. I need to find the side length of the hexagon.

Hmm, let me try to visualize this. A convex hexagon with opposite sides parallel and equal in length because it's equilateral. So, sides AB and DE are parallel and equal, BC and EF are parallel and equal, and CD and FA are parallel and equal. But wait, the problem says it's equilateral, so all sides are equal in length, not necessarily the opposite sides. Wait, no, hold on. Actually, "equilateral" usually means all sides are equal in length, but in a hexagon, if it's also convex and all opposite sides are parallel, that might imply some regularity but not necessarily a regular hexagon because the angles might not be equal.

Wait, no, actually, an equilateral hexagon is one where all six sides are equal, but it's not necessarily regular. So, in this case, all sides are equal, and opposite sides are parallel. So, it's like a regular hexagon but maybe stretched or something.

The triangle is formed by extending AB, CD, and EF. So, each of these sides is extended until they meet to form a triangle. The sides of this triangle are 200, 240, and 300. I need to relate this triangle to the hexagon's side length.

I think I should draw a diagram to understand this better. Since I can't draw, I'll try to imagine it. Let me denote the hexagon as ABCDEF, with AB, BC, CD, DE, EF, FA as the consecutive sides. All sides are equal in length, say length 's'. Opposite sides are parallel, so AB || DE, BC || EF, CD || FA.

Now, when we extend AB, CD, and EF, they form a triangle. Let me think about how these extensions would intersect. Extending AB beyond A and beyond B, CD beyond C and beyond D, and EF beyond E and beyond F. The intersections of these extended sides will form the triangle.

Wait, maybe I should consider the triangle formed by AB, CD, and EF. But AB, CD, and EF are sides of the hexagon. Since the hexagon is convex, AB and CD would meet at some point outside the hexagon when extended. Similarly, CD and EF would meet elsewhere, and EF and AB would meet as well.

Alternatively, perhaps the triangle is formed by the extensions of AB, CD, EF, meaning each of these sides is extended beyond one end, and their extensions meet to form the triangle. Let's say, for example, extending AB beyond A, CD beyond C, and EF beyond E, and these three extended lines form the triangle. Or maybe it's another combination.

I think I need to recall if there's a formula or theorem related to such hexagons. Since all opposite sides are parallel, the hexagon is called a "zonogon." In a zonogon, opposite sides are equal and parallel, and it can be thought of as a 2n-gon with opposite sides equal and parallel.

Moreover, in a convex zonogon, the extensions of every other side form a triangle. So, in this case, the triangle formed by AB, CD, EF's extensions.

I remember that in such cases, the sides of the triangle are proportional to the extensions beyond the hexagon, and the side length of the hexagon can be found using the properties of similar triangles or area ratios.

Wait, maybe I can model this problem using coordinate geometry. Let me try to assign coordinates to the hexagon's vertices and see if I can derive the side length.

Let me place the hexagon in a coordinate system such that the center is at the origin, and maybe one of the sides is aligned with an axis. But I'm not sure if this will help directly. Alternatively, perhaps I can model the hexagon as being built by translating vectors in opposite directions.

Since opposite sides are parallel, each pair can be thought of as vectors. Let me denote the vectors as follows:

Letâ€™s denote vector AB as **v**, BC as **w**, CD as **u**, DE as **v** (since opposite sides are parallel and equal), EF as **w**, and FA as **u**. So, the hexagon can be thought of as being constructed by vectors **v**, **w**, **u**, **v**, **w**, **u**, in order.

Wait, actually, in a zonogon, the sides can be represented as vectors that add up to zero because it's a closed polygon. So, **v** + **w** + **u** + **v** + **w** + **u** = 0. That simplifies to 2(**v** + **w** + **u**) = 0, so **v** + **w** + **u** = 0.

This might be useful later.

Now, considering the triangle formed by the extensions of AB, CD, and EF. Let's denote the triangle as T with sides 200, 240, 300. Let me denote the lengths of these sides as t1=200, t2=240, t3=300.

I think the triangle T is similar to some triangle related to the hexagon's sides. Alternatively, the sides of triangle T can be thought of as the result of extending the sides AB, CD, EF beyond the hexagon, and the lengths between their intersection points are 200, 240, 300.

Wait, perhaps I can use the concept of similar triangles here. When you extend the sides of the hexagon, the resulting triangle is similar to the triangle formed by the "directions" of the sides.

Alternatively, maybe I can model the triangle T as the outer triangle, and the hexagon is inscribed within it in some way.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think in terms of similar triangles and ratios.

Let me consider the hexagon being inside the triangle T. Each side of the hexagon is parallel to a side of the triangle or something like that.

Wait, no, in this case, the sides AB, CD, EF are being extended to form triangle T, so triangle T is outside the hexagon.

Let me imagine the hexagon as a sort of truncated triangle, where each side of the triangle is cut by a line parallel to it, creating a smaller hexagon inside. But in this case, the triangle is formed by the extensions, so maybe it's the opposite.

Wait, perhaps the hexagon is a section of the triangle T, such that each extension of a side of the hexagon leads to a vertex of triangle T.

Alternatively, maybe using the concept of affine transformations or similarity.

Wait, another approach: Since the hexagon is equilateral and opposite sides are parallel, the triangle T is the result of extending three sides of the hexagon. These extensions create similar smaller triangles at each corner, and the side lengths of T correspond to the sum of the side length of the hexagon and the length of these extensions.

Wait, perhaps each side of triangle T is equal to the side length of the hexagon plus twice the length of the extension beyond the hexagon. But I'm not sure.

Wait, maybe I need to use the concept of intercept theorem (Thales' theorem) here.

Let me try to model the hexagon as a central part, with lines extending from each side to form the triangle.

Let me denote the side length of the hexagon as 's'. When I extend AB, CD, and EF, they meet to form triangle T. Since AB, CD, and EF are sides of the hexagon, which is equilateral, each of these sides is length 's'.

Now, let me consider the triangle T. Each side of T is formed by the extension of one of these sides. So, for example, side opposite to vertex A in triangle T is 200, which is formed by the extension of AB beyond A and beyond B. Wait, no, actually, triangle T is formed by the extensions of AB, CD, and EF. So, each extension is a line that starts at a vertex of the hexagon and goes outward.

Wait, perhaps each side of triangle T is formed by two extensions. For instance, the extension of AB beyond A and the extension of EF beyond F meet at a point, which is a vertex of triangle T. Similarly for the others.

So, the triangle T has three vertices, each formed by the intersection of two extended sides of the hexagon. Each of these intersections is a point outside the hexagon.

Since the hexagon is convex, these intersections will form a larger triangle enclosing the hexagon.

Now, I need to relate the side lengths of triangle T (200, 240, 300) to the side length 's' of the hexagon.

I think the key is to realize that the hexagon can be thought of as a result of cutting off three smaller triangles from triangle T, each cut being parallel to a side of T. Wait, that might be the case.

Wait, if you have a large triangle T, and you cut off three smaller triangles from it, each cut being parallel to a side, you end up with a convex hexagon. Each of the cuts would be a line segment, which would be a side of the hexagon.

Since the hexagon is equilateral, all the sides are equal, so the lengths of these cuts must be equal. Also, the opposite sides of the hexagon are parallel to the sides of triangle T.

So, in this scenario, the hexagon is similar to the inner part of triangle T, with each side parallel to a side of T, and each side of the hexagon is length 's'.

Given that, I can model the hexagon as a similar figure inside triangle T, scaled down by some factor.

Let me denote the scaling factor as 'k', so that each side of the hexagon is k times the corresponding side of triangle T. Wait, no, because the sides of the hexagon are not directly proportional to the sides of T, but they are parallel and equidistant from the sides of T.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think in terms of the ratio of the areas. But I don't have the area of T, so maybe that's not helpful.

Alternatively, maybe using similar triangles.

Let me consider one side of triangle T, say length 200. The hexagon will have a side that is parallel to this side, and the distance between this side of T and the corresponding side of the hexagon is the same for all three sides.

Wait, but all sides of the hexagon are equal, so the scaling factor must be the same for all sides.

Wait, perhaps each side of the hexagon is a certain fraction of the corresponding side of triangle T, such that the remaining parts of T form similar triangles.

Let me think of triangle T as being divided into three smaller similar triangles and the hexagon. Each of these smaller triangles is similar to T because the sides are parallel.

So, each side of T is equal to the corresponding side of the hexagon plus twice the length of the extension beyond the hexagon.

Wait, maybe each side of triangle T is equal to the side length of the hexagon plus twice the length of the extension beyond the hexagon on each end.

But since the hexagon is equilateral, the extensions beyond each side must be the same in some way.

Wait, perhaps I should denote the extensions as x, y, z for each side, but since all sides of the hexagon are equal, maybe the extensions are proportional to the sides of T.

This is getting a bit confusing. Maybe I can use coordinate geometry to model this.

Let me place triangle T in a coordinate system. Let's say triangle T has vertices at points A', B', C', with sides of lengths 200, 240, and 300. Let me assign coordinates such that A' is at (0, 0), B' is at (200, 0), and C' is somewhere in the plane. I need to compute the coordinates of C'.

Wait, but triangle T has sides 200, 240, 300. Let me check if it's a right-angled triangle.

Using Pythagoras: 200Â² + 240Â² = 40000 + 57600 = 97600. 300Â² is 90000, so no, it's not a right-angled triangle.

Wait, but maybe it's similar to some other triangle. Let me compute the ratios:

200:240:300 simplifies to 10:12:15.

Hmm, 10, 12, 15. Does that form a Pythagorean triplet? 10Â² + 12Â² = 100 + 144 = 244, which is not equal to 15Â²=225. So no, it's not a right-angled triangle.

But perhaps I can compute the area using Heron's formula to find the height or something.

Wait, maybe it's better to assign coordinates in a way that will make calculations easier. Let me place A' at (0,0), B' at (200, 0), and C' somewhere in the plane such that the lengths from A' to C' is 300, and from B' to C' is 240.

So, coordinates:

A' = (0, 0)

B' = (200, 0)

C' = (x, y)

We have:

Distance from A' to C' is 300: sqrt(xÂ² + yÂ²) = 300

Distance from B' to C' is 240: sqrt((x-200)Â² + yÂ²) = 240

So, we have two equations:

1. xÂ² + yÂ² = 90000

2. (x-200)^2 + y^2 = 57600

Subtracting equation 2 from equation 1:

xÂ² + yÂ² - [(x-200)^2 + yÂ²] = 90000 - 57600

Expanding:

xÂ² - (xÂ² - 400x + 40000) = 32400

Simplify:

xÂ² - xÂ² + 400x - 40000 = 32400

400x = 32400 + 40000 = 72400

x = 72400 / 400 = 181

Then, from equation 1: xÂ² + yÂ² = 90000

So, 181Â² + yÂ² = 90000

181Â² is 32761, so yÂ² = 90000 - 32761 = 57239

So, y = sqrt(57239) â‰ˆ 239.247, but perhaps it's exact value is sqrt(57239). Let me check 239Â²=57121, 240Â²=57600, so it's between them.

But maybe it's not necessary to compute the exact value right now.

So, the coordinates of C' are (181, sqrt(57239)).

Now, the hexagon is inside triangle T, such that each side of the hexagon is parallel to a side of T, and each side of the hexagon is of length 's'.

Moreover, the hexagon is equilateral and convex.

So, the hexagon can be thought of as a similar triangle inside T, scaled down by some factor and shifted towards the centroid.

Wait, but each side of the hexagon is a side of a smaller triangle inside T, and the hexagon is formed by connecting these sides.

Wait, actually, maybe the hexagon is similar to the medial triangle or something like that, but adjusted for the three sides.

Alternatively, perhaps the hexagon is formed by lines parallel to the sides of triangle T, cutting off smaller triangles from T.

Each of these smaller triangles would be similar to T, and the side length of the hexagon would be the side length of T minus twice the length of the cut-off part.

Wait, but since the hexagon has six sides, maybe each side of the hexagon corresponds to a side of one of these smaller similar triangles.

Alternatively, perhaps I can model each side of the hexagon as a portion of the sides of T.

Wait, another idea: The hexagon can be thought of as the inner parallel curve of the triangle T, at a certain distance from each side.

Since all sides of the hexagon are equidistant from the corresponding sides of T, the side length 's' of the hexagon would be equal to the side length of T minus twice the distance multiplied by the tangent of the angle at that side.

Wait, but I'm not sure about that. Maybe I should consider the ratios.

Let me denote that each side of the hexagon is a certain ratio of the corresponding side of T. Since the hexagon is equidistant from each side, the ratio should be the same for all sides.

Wait, but the hexagon's sides are equal, but the sides of T are 200, 240, 300. So, the ratio can't be the same for all unless the hexagon's sides are scaled proportionally.

Wait, no, because the hexagon is equilateral, so all its sides are the same length, but the triangle T has sides of different lengths. So, the scaling factors for each side would be different, but somehow related to the side length 's'.

Wait, maybe I can use the concept of similar triangles for each corner. Let me imagine that each side of the hexagon is parallel to a side of T and cuts off a small triangle from T. The remaining part between the hexagon and T is a trapezoid for each side.

But since the hexagon is equilateral, the lengths of these trapezoids must be such that the remaining parts on each side of T are proportional.

Wait, perhaps each side of T is divided into two segments by the hexagon, each of length 'a' and 'b', such that a + b = side length of T.

But since the hexagon is equidistant from each side of T, the ratios a/b should be consistent across all sides.

Wait, let me think about the triangle T and the hexagon inside it.

Suppose that from each side of T, we cut off a segment of length 'a' and 'b' such that a + b equals the side length of T. Since the hexagon's sides are parallel to T's sides, the triangles cut off are similar to T.

For example, from side A'B' of length 200, we cut off a segment of length 'a' near A' and 'b' near B', with a + b = 200. Similarly for the other sides.

Since the cut-off triangles are similar to T, their sides are proportional. So, the ratio of a to the entire side is the same as the scaling factor for the similar triangle.

Let me denote the scaling factor as k for the triangles cut off from T. Then, the sides of these small triangles would be k*200, k*240, k*300.

But the sides of the hexagon are formed by the lines cutting off these triangles, so each side of the hexagon is parallel and corresponds to the base of the small triangle.

Wait, actually, the side of the hexagon would be the side of the small triangle if it's cut off, but in this case, the hexagon is formed by the inner sides of the trapezoids, so maybe the side length 's' of the hexagon relates to the remaining part of T after cutting off the small triangles.

Wait, let's consider one side of T, say A'B' of length 200. If we cut off a triangle from it with base length 'a', then the remaining length on A'B' is 200 - a, which would be the base for the corresponding trapezoid. But the side of the hexagon would be the line parallel to A'B' at a distance such that it's part of the hexagon.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider the fact that each side of the hexagon is a side of a smaller triangle similar to T, and the hexagon is formed by connecting these smaller triangles.

Wait, this is getting complicated. Maybe I should look for a formula or relationship that connects the side length of the hexagon to the sides of the outer triangle.

I recall that in such cases, the side length of the hexagon can be found using the formula:

s = (a*b + b*c + c*a) / (a + b + c)

But I'm not sure if that's correct.

Wait, let me think differently.

Since the hexagon is equilateral and all opposite sides are parallel, the hexagon can be considered as a translation of a smaller triangle inside the larger triangle T.

Wait, another approach: The lines AB, CD, EF are extended to form triangle T with sides 200, 240, 300. So, each side of T is an extension of a side of the hexagon.

Since the hexagon is equilateral, the lengths from the hexagon's vertices to the triangle T's vertices can be related proportionally.

Let me denote the points where the extensions meet as A', B', C', forming triangle T.

So, for example, extending AB beyond A and beyond B meets at A' and B', respectively. Similarly, extending CD beyond C and D meets at C' and D', but wait, the triangle is formed by the three extensions: AB, CD, EF.

Wait, perhaps each vertex of triangle T is the intersection of two extended sides of the hexagon.

For example, vertex A' is the intersection of AB extended and CD extended. Vertex B' is the intersection of CD extended and EF extended. Vertex C' is the intersection of EF extended and AB extended.

Wait, maybe not exactly, but something along those lines.

Let me try to use the concept of similar triangles for each of these intersections.

Let me denote the side length of the hexagon as 's'. When I extend AB beyond A and beyond B, these extensions will meet the extensions of CD and EF to form triangle T.

Each of these extensions will form similar triangles with the original triangle T.

Wait, for instance, when I extend AB beyond A, it will meet the extension of CD beyond C at some point, say A'. The triangle formed by A', the extension of AB, and the extension of CD would be similar to triangle T.

Similarly, extending AB beyond B will meet the extension of EF beyond F at another point, say B', forming another similar triangle.

Wait, this is getting a bit tangled. Maybe I should use coordinate geometry.

Let me assign coordinates to the hexagon and triangle T. Let me place point A at (0, 0), and since AB is of length 's', point B would be at (s, 0). But since the hexagon is convex and equilateral with opposite sides parallel, the other points can be determined based on vectors.

Wait, perhaps using vectors as I thought earlier. Let me denote the vectors AB, BC, CD, etc., as vectors **v**, **w**, **u**, etc.

Given that the hexagon is convex and equilateral with opposite sides parallel, the sum of vectors **v** + **w** + **u** = 0, as I thought earlier.

Now, the triangle T is formed by the extensions of AB, CD, EF. So, the sides of T are the lines AB extended, CD extended, EF extended.

Let me consider the lines AB, CD, EF.

Line AB can be represented parametrically as starting at A and going in the direction of vector **v**. Similarly, line CD starts at C and goes in the direction of vector **u**.

Wait, but since the hexagon is closed, point D is C plus vector **u**, etc.

Wait, maybe I can model the lines parametrically and find their intersection points to get the vertices of triangle T.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use the concept of similar triangles and ratios.

Wait, since the hexagon is equilateral and convex, and opposite sides are parallel, the distances from the sides of the hexagon to the corresponding sides of triangle T are proportional.

Wait, let me consider that each side of the hexagon is a certain distance away from the corresponding side of triangle T, and since the hexagon is equidistant, the ratios of the distances correspond to the side lengths.

Wait, perhaps I can think of the hexagon as a result of moving each side of triangle T inward by a certain distance, such that the resulting figure is a hexagon with equal sides.

In that case, the side length 's' of the hexagon would relate to the sides of triangle T through the ratio of the distances.

But I'm not sure how to compute that.

Wait, another idea: The hexagon can be considered as a section of the triangle T, where each side of the hexagon is the intersection of two lines parallel to the sides of T.

Given that, the side length of the hexagon can be found using the formula for a line parallel to a side of a triangle cutting off a smaller triangle, resulting in a hexagon.

Wait, I think the formula for the side length of the hexagon in such a case is given by the harmonic mean or some combination of the sides of the outer triangle.

Wait, perhaps the side length 's' of the hexagon is equal to (200*240 + 240*300 + 300*200)/(200 + 240 + 300). Let me compute that.

Compute numerator: 200*240 = 48,000; 240*300 = 72,000; 300*200 = 60,000. Sum: 48,000 +72,000 +60,000 = 180,000.

Denominator: 200 +240 +300 = 740.

So, s = 180,000 / 740 â‰ˆ 243.243. Hmm, not sure if that's correct.

Wait, but I think the formula is s = (a + b + c)/2, but that would be 200+240+300=740; 740/2=370, which is larger than the triangle's sides, so that can't be.

Alternatively, maybe the side length of the hexagon is the harmonic mean of the sides of the triangle.

Wait, the harmonic mean of 200, 240, 300 is 3/(1/200 + 1/240 + 1/300). Let me compute that.

Compute reciprocals:

1/200 = 0.005

1/240 â‰ˆ 0.00416667

1/300 â‰ˆ 0.00333333

Sum â‰ˆ 0.0125

So, harmonic mean H = 3 / 0.0125 = 240. Hmm, 240. But the sides of the triangle are 200,240,300, so 240 is one of them, which seems coincidental.

Alternatively, maybe it's the reciprocal of the sum of reciprocals, but that gives 1/( (1/200) + (1/240) + (1/300) ) â‰ˆ 1/0.0125 = 80. Hmm, 80 is a possible side length, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps using the formula for a hexagon formed by three pairs of parallel lines, each pair cutting off a triangle from the original triangle T.

In such a case, the side length 's' of the hexagon can be found using the formula:

s = (a*b + b*c + c*a)/(a + b + c)

Wait, earlier I calculated that as 180,000 /740 â‰ˆ 243.243.

Wait, but let me think if that makes sense.

If the triangle T has sides 200, 240, 300, and the hexagon inside it has side length s, which is about 243, but that's larger than some sides of T, which doesn't seem possible because the hexagon should be inside T.

Wait, that suggests that maybe the formula is incorrect.

Alternatively, maybe the side length is the reciprocal of that, but 740 / (200 + 240 + 300) = 740 / 740 = 1, which doesn't make sense.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider the ratios of the sides.

Let me denote the ratios of the sides of the hexagon to the sides of T as r1, r2, r3, such that s = r1*200, s = r2*240, s = r3*300.

So, r1 = s/200, r2 = s/240, r3 = s/300.

Since the hexagon is equidistant from each side, these ratios should satisfy some condition related to the area or the inradius.

Wait, but without knowing the inradius of T, I'm not sure.

Wait, another idea: Since the hexagon is equilateral and convex, with all sides equal and opposite sides parallel, it's similar to a regular hexagon but scaled.

But I don't think that's directly helpful.

Wait, perhaps using barycentric coordinates. Let me consider the triangle T with vertices A', B', C'.

The hexagon is inside T, and each side of the hexagon is parallel to a side of T.

So, each vertex of the hexagon lies on a line parallel to a side of T.

Let me denote the hexagon as ABCDEF, with AB parallel to A'B', BC parallel to B'C', etc.

Wait, but in the problem statement, all opposite sides are parallel. So, AB || DE, BC || EF, CD || FA.

Hmm, that complicates things.

Wait, perhaps it's better to consider affine transformations. Since the hexagon is equilateral with opposite sides parallel, it can be transformed into a regular hexagon via an affine transformation, which preserves ratios and parallelism.

In that case, the triangle T would also be transformed into another triangle, and the side length could be found via scaling.

But I'm not sure how to proceed with that.

Wait, another approach: Using the concept of similar triangles for each extension.

When you extend AB beyond A and beyond B, you get two lines that form two sides of triangle T.

Similarly, extending CD beyond C and D, and EF beyond E and F, you get the other sides of T.

Each of these extensions forms similar triangles with the original triangle T.

So, for example, extending AB beyond A forms a triangle similar to T, and the ratio of similarity can be used to find the side length 's'.

Wait, let's say that the extension of AB beyond A meets the extension of CD beyond C at point A'. Similarly, the extension of AB beyond B meets the extension of EF beyond F at point B', and the extension of CD beyond D meets the extension of EF beyond E at point C'.

So, triangle A'B'C' is our triangle T with sides 200, 240, 300.

Now, let me consider the triangle formed by the extension of AB beyond A and CD beyond C, which is triangle AA'C.

Wait, perhaps not, maybe it's triangle A'A''C'' where A'' is a point along the extension.

Wait, perhaps I should model this with Menelaus' theorem or something.

Alternatively, let me consider that the lines AB, CD, EF are concurrent with the sides of triangle T.

Wait, maybe using the intercept theorem.

Wait, another idea: The hexagon can be considered as the inner parallel curve of triangle T, offset by a certain distance 'd' from each side. The side length 's' of the hexagon would then relate to the sides of T and the offset distance 'd'.

But how?

Wait, perhaps the side length 's' is equal to the side of T minus twice the projection of 'd' onto that side.

But without knowing 'd', I can't compute it directly.

Wait, maybe I can express 'd' in terms of the sides of T and the side length 's'.

Alternatively, the distance 'd' can be related to the inradius of triangle T.

Wait, but the inradius r of triangle T can be found using the formula r = A/s, where A is the area and s is the semi-perimeter.

First, compute the semi-perimeter of T: (200 + 240 + 300)/2 = 740/2 = 370.

Then, compute the area using Heron's formula: sqrt[s(s - a)(s - b)(s - c)].

So, A = sqrt[370*(370 - 200)*(370 - 240)*(370 - 300)] = sqrt[370*170*130*70].

Compute inside the sqrt:

370 *170 = 62,900

130 *70 = 9,100

Then, 62,900 * 9,100 = Let me compute:

First, 62,900 * 9,100 = 62,900 * 9.1 * 10^3

Compute 62,900 * 9.1:

62,900 * 9 = 566,100

62,900 * 0.1 = 6,290

Total: 566,100 + 6,290 = 572,390

So, 572,390 * 10^3 = 572,390,000.

So, A = sqrt(572,390,000).

Compute sqrt(572,390,000):

Since 23,924^2 â‰ˆ 572,390,000 (from earlier, since 181^2=32,761, but maybe not relevant).

Wait, actually, 23,924^2 = approximately (24,000 - 76)^2 â‰ˆ 576,000,000 - 2*24,000*76 + 76^2, which is way off. Maybe I made a mistake earlier.

Wait, perhaps I should compute 370*170*130*70 numerically.

Compute step by step:

370 * 170 = 370*100 + 370*70 = 37,000 + 25,900 = 62,900.

130 *70 = 9,100.

Now, 62,900 *9,100.

Compute 62,900 *9,100:

= 62,900 * (9,000 + 100)

= 62,900*9,000 + 62,900*100

= 566,100,000 + 6,290,000

= 572,390,000.

So, area A = sqrt(572,390,000).

Compute sqrt(572,390,000):

Note that 23,924^2 = approx 572,390,000.

Wait, 23,924 * 23,924:

Compute 24,000^2 = 576,000,000.

Subtract 76*2*24,000 = 76*48,000 = 3,648,000.

So, 576,000,000 - 3,648,000 = 572,352,000.

But 23,924^2 = (24,000 - 76)^2 = 24,000^2 - 2*24,000*76 +76^2 = 576,000,000 - 3,648,000 + 5,776 = 576,000,000 - 3,648,000 = 572,352,000 + 5,776 = 572,357,776.

But our value is 572,390,000, which is higher. So, sqrt(572,390,000) is approximately 23,924 + (572,390,000 -572,357,776)/(2*23,924).

Compute difference: 572,390,000 -572,357,776 = 32,224.

So, approximate sqrt: 23,924 + 32,224/(2*23,924) â‰ˆ 23,924 + 32,224/47,848 â‰ˆ 23,924 + 0.673 â‰ˆ 23,924.673.

So, area A â‰ˆ 23,924.673.

Then, inradius r = A / s = 23,924.673 / 370 â‰ˆ 64.66.

So, the inradius is approximately 64.66.

But how does this help me? The inradius is the distance from the incenter to each side, but in this case, the hexagon is not necessarily the incircle.

Wait, but perhaps the distance from the hexagon's sides to T's sides is related to the inradius.

Wait, maybe the side length 's' of the hexagon is equal to the inradius times some factor. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the side length 's' can be found using the formula for the side of a similar figure within the triangle.

Wait, another approach: The hexagon is such that each of its sides is a certain distance away from the corresponding side of T, and because of that, the ratio of the side length 's' to the side of T is equal to (distance from side to hexagon divided by inradius).

But without knowing the exact distance, I can't compute 's'.

Wait, perhaps instead of the inradius, I should compute the distance from each side of T to the corresponding side of the hexagon. Let's denote this distance as 'd'.

Since the hexagon is equidistant from each side of T, the distance 'd' is the same for all sides.

In that case, the side length 's' of the hexagon is related to the sides of T and 'd' via the formula:

s = (a - 2d * (a / h_a)),

where h_a is the height corresponding to side a.

Wait, but I don't know the heights.

Alternatively, perhaps using the formula for the length of a line parallel to a side of a triangle at a distance 'd' from it. The length would be a - (2d / h_a) * a, where h_a is the height corresponding to side a.

Wait, actually, the length of a line parallel to side a at a distance 'd' from it would be a*(1 - (d / h_a)).

But since the hexagon is equidistant from all sides, 'd' is the same for all sides, but each h_a is different, so the scaling factor for each side would be different.

Hmm, that complicates things.

Wait, but the hexagon's side length 's' is the same for all sides, so:

s = a*(1 - d / h_a) = b*(1 - d / h_b) = c*(1 - d / h_c).

Therefore, for all three sides:

(1 - d / h_a) = (1 - d / h_b) = (1 - d / h_c) = s / a = s / b = s / c.

But since a, b, c are different, this can only be true if d is zero, which isn't the case. So, perhaps this approach is flawed.

Wait, maybe instead of being equidistant in terms of Euclidean distance, the hexagon is equidistant in terms of some other measure.

Wait, perhaps the ratio of distances is consistent across all sides, but I'm not sure.

Wait, maybe I can use the areas.

The area of triangle T is approximately 23,924.673 as computed earlier.

The hexagon is inside T, so its area is less.

But without knowing the exact area, I can't directly find 's'.

Wait, perhaps another approach: The hexagon can be considered as the inner parallel curve at a certain distance from each side of T, creating a hexagon with equal sides.

In such a case, the side length 's' of the hexagon can be found using the formula:

s = (a + b + c) / (2 + sqrt(3)),

but I'm not sure about the exact formula.

Alternatively, perhaps using the reciprocals.

Wait, maybe I can consider that the hexagon divides each side of T into segments proportional to some ratio.

Let me denote that each side of T is divided into lengths proportional to k and 1 - k, where k is the fraction from one vertex.

Then, for side A'B' of length 200, the division would be at 200k and 200(1 - k).

Similarly for other sides.

Since the hexagon is equidistant from all sides, the ratios should be consistent.

But since the hexagon is equilateral, the lengths of these segments should relate to the side length 's'.

Wait, perhaps the side length 's' relates to these segments.

Wait, if I denote that on each side of T, the length from the vertex to the point where the hexagon's side starts is 'x', then the remaining length is (side length - x).

But since the hexagon is equidistant from all sides, the ratios x / (side length) should be the same for all sides.

Let me denote this ratio as r. Then, x = r * side length.

Thus, on side A'B' of length 200, the division is at 200r and 200(1 - r).

Similarly, on side B'C' of length 240, division is at 240r and 240(1 - r).

On side C'A' of length 300, division is at 300r and 300(1 - r).

Now, the hexagon's sides are formed by lines connecting these division points.

Since the hexagon is equilateral, the lengths of these connecting lines must be equal.

So, the length of each side of the hexagon is equal to the distance between two division points on adjacent sides of T.

Let me compute the distance between two division points.

For example, on side A'B' at point P (200r from A'), and on side B'C' at point Q (240r from B'), the distance PQ should be equal to 's'.

But how do I compute PQ?

Let me model triangle T with coordinates.

Earlier, I placed A' at (0, 0), B' at (200, 0), and C' at (181, sqrt(57239)).

So, point P on A'B' is at (200r, 0).

Point Q on B'C' is somewhere along B'C'.

First, find the coordinates of point Q.

The line B'C' goes from (200, 0) to (181, sqrt(57239)).

The vector from B' to C' is (-19, sqrt(57239)).

So, the parametric equation of line B'C' is:

x = 200 - 19t

y = 0 + sqrt(57239) * t

where t ranges from 0 to 1.

The point Q is located at a fraction r from B', so t = r.

Thus, coordinates of Q are:

x = 200 - 19r

y = sqrt(57239) * r

Now, point P is at (200r, 0), and point Q is at (200 -19r, sqrt(57239)*r).

The distance PQ is sqrt[(200 -19r - 200r)^2 + (sqrt(57239)*r - 0)^2] = sqrt[(200 - 219r)^2 + (57239 r^2)].

This distance must be equal to 's'.

But the hexagon is equilateral, so all sides are equal. Therefore, the distance between any two adjacent points on T must be equal to 's'.

Wait, but this seems complicated. Maybe I can set up the equation for the distance PQ and set it equal to 's', then find 'r'.

But since this is just one side, perhaps we need another equation.

Wait, let's also compute the distance between point Q on B'C' and point R on C'A', and set that equal to 's' as well.

Point R is on C'A', which goes from (181, sqrt(57239)) to (0, 0).

The parametric equation for C'A' is:

x = 181 - 181t

y = sqrt(57239) - sqrt(57239)t

where t ranges from 0 to 1.

Point R is located at a fraction r from C', so t = r.

Thus, coordinates of R are:

x = 181(1 - r)

y = sqrt(57239)(1 - r)

Now, the distance QR is between Q(200-19r, sqrt(57239)*r) and R(181(1 - r), sqrt(57239)(1 - r)).

Compute the distance QR:

sqrt[ (181(1 - r) - (200 -19r))^2 + (sqrt(57239)(1 - r) - sqrt(57239) r)^2 ]

Simplify the x-coordinate difference:

181(1 - r) - (200 -19r) = 181 - 181r -200 +19r = (-19) -162r

Y-coordinate difference:

sqrt(57239)(1 - r) - sqrt(57239)r = sqrt(57239)(1 - 2r)

So, distance QR is sqrt[ (-19 -162r)^2 + (sqrt(57239)(1 - 2r))^2 ]

Set this equal to 's'.

But since the hexagon is equilateral, both PQ and QR must be equal to 's'.

Thus, we have two equations:

1. sqrt[ (200 - 219r)^2 + (57239 r^2) ] = s

2. sqrt[ ( -19 -162r )^2 + (57239 (1 - 2r)^2 ) ] = s

Since both equal to 's', set them equal to each other:

sqrt[ (200 - 219r)^2 + (57239 r^2) ] = sqrt[ ( -19 -162r )^2 + (57239 (1 - 2r)^2 ) ]

Square both sides:

(200 - 219r)^2 + 57239 r^2 = ( -19 -162r )^2 + 57239 (1 - 2r)^2

Expand each term:

Left side:

(200 - 219r)^2 = 200Â² - 2*200*219r + (219r)^2 = 40,000 - 87,600r + 47,961rÂ²

Plus 57239 rÂ²: 40,000 -87,600r + (47,961 +57,239)rÂ² = 40,000 -87,600r + 105,200rÂ²

Right side:

( -19 -162r )^2 = (-19)^2 + 2*(-19)*(-162r) + (162r)^2 = 361 + 6,156r + 26,244rÂ²

Plus 57239*(1 -2r)^2:

57239*(1 -4r +4rÂ²) =57239 - 228,956r + 228,956rÂ²

So, total right side:

361 +6,156r +26,244rÂ² +57,239 -228,956r +228,956rÂ²

Combine like terms:

Constant terms: 361 +57,239 =57,600

r terms:6,156r -228,956r = -222,800r

rÂ² terms:26,244rÂ² +228,956rÂ² =255,200rÂ²

So, right side is 57,600 -222,800r +255,200rÂ²

Set left and right sides equal:

40,000 -87,600r +105,200rÂ² =57,600 -222,800r +255,200rÂ²

Bring all terms to left side:

40,000 -87,600r +105,200rÂ² -57,600 +222,800r -255,200rÂ² =0

Compute each term:

Constants:40,000 -57,600= -17,600

r terms:-87,600r +222,800r=135,200r

rÂ² terms:105,200rÂ² -255,200rÂ²= -150,000rÂ²

So, equation becomes:

-150,000rÂ² +135,200r -17,600=0

Multiply both sides by -1:

150,000rÂ² -135,200r +17,600=0

Divide all terms by 100 to simplify:

1,500rÂ² -1,352r +176=0

Now, solve for r using quadratic formula:

r = [1,352 Â± sqrt(1,352Â² -4*1,500*176)] / (2*1,500)

Compute discriminant D:

1,352Â² = (1,300 +52)^2 =1,300Â² +2*1,300*52 +52Â²=1,690,000 +135,200 +2,704= 1,690,000+135,200=1,825,200 +2,704=1,827,904

4*1,500*176=6,000*176=1,056,000

So, D=1,827,904 -1,056,000=771,904

sqrt(D)=sqrt(771,904)=878. Because 878Â²=771,  since 800Â²=640,000, 878Â²= (800+78)^2=800Â² + 2*800*78 +78Â²=640,000 +124,800 +6,084=640,000+124,800=764,800+6,084=770,884. Wait, that's 770,884, which is less than 771,904.

Wait, perhaps sqrt(771,904)=878. Let me compute 878Â²:

800Â²=640,000

78Â²=6,084

2*800*78=124,800

So, 640,000 +124,800=764,800 +6,084=770,884.

Hmm, which is less than 771,904.

Wait, 879Â²= (878+1)^2=878Â² +2*878 +1=770,884 +1,756 +1=772,641.

But 772,641 is greater than 771,904. So, sqrt(771,904) is between 878 and 879.

Compute 771,904 -770,884=1,020.

So, 878 + 1,020/(2*878) â‰ˆ878 +1,020/1,756â‰ˆ878 +0.581â‰ˆ878.581.

So, sqrt(D)=approx878.581.

Thus,

r = [1,352 Â±878.581]/3,000

Compute both roots:

First root: (1,352 +878.581)/3,000â‰ˆ(2,230.581)/3,000â‰ˆ0.7435

Second root: (1,352 -878.581)/3,000â‰ˆ(473.419)/3,000â‰ˆ0.1578

Now, r must be between 0 and 0.5 because if r were greater than 0.5, the division points would be beyond the midpoints, and the hexagon might not close properly. So, we take the smaller root, râ‰ˆ0.1578.

Thus, râ‰ˆ0.1578.

Now, compute 's' using one of the earlier equations, say equation 1:

s = sqrt[ (200 -219r)^2 + (57239 rÂ²) ]

Compute 200 -219r:

200 -219*0.1578 â‰ˆ200 -34.534â‰ˆ165.466

Compute (165.466)^2â‰ˆ27,377.3

Compute 57239*(0.1578)^2â‰ˆ57239*0.0249â‰ˆ1,422.1

So, sâ‰ˆsqrt(27,377.3 +1,422.1)=sqrt(28,800)=170.

Wait, sqrt(28,800) is sqrt(100*288)=10*sqrt(288)=10*sqrt(144*2)=10*12*sqrt(2)=120*sqrt(2)â‰ˆ169.7, which is approximately 170.

So, sâ‰ˆ170.

Therefore, the side length of the hexagon is 170.

**Final Answer**
The side length of the hexagon is \boxed{170}.
