Okay, so I have this problem here about rectangular boxes with a surface area of 54 and a volume of 23. I need to find the radius of the smallest sphere that can contain any of these boxes, and then express r squared as a fraction p/q where p and q are coprime positive integers, and then find p+q. Hmm, okay, let's try to break this down.

First, I know that for a rectangular box with side lengths a, b, c, the surface area S is given by 2(ab + bc + ac) and the volume V is given by abc. So here, S = 54 and V = 23.

So, I can write:

2(ab + bc + ac) = 54
=> ab + bc + ac = 27.

And abc = 23.

Now, the sphere that contains the box must have a radius equal to half the space diagonal of the box. The space diagonal d of a box with sides a, b, c is given by sqrt(a² + b² + c²). Therefore, the radius r is d/2, so r² would be (a² + b² + c²)/4.

So, my goal is to find the minimum value of (a² + b² + c²)/4, given the constraints ab + bc + ac = 27 and abc = 23.

Wait, but actually, since the sphere must contain the box regardless of its dimensions, I think I need the maximum possible value of the space diagonal, which would correspond to the maximum of a² + b² + c². Hmm, no, wait. Actually, the sphere that can contain any box from set B must have a radius large enough to contain the box with the maximum space diagonal. So, to find the smallest such sphere, I need the maximum possible space diagonal among all boxes in B. Therefore, I need to find the maximum of a² + b² + c² given the constraints ab + bc + ac = 27 and abc = 23.

Wait, but is that correct? Because for a given surface area and volume, the space diagonal can vary. So, the boxes can have different dimensions, and each will have a different space diagonal. The sphere must be big enough to contain the box with the largest space diagonal. So, I need to find the maximum of a² + b² + c² given ab + bc + ac = 27 and abc =23.

Alternatively, maybe I can express a² + b² + c² in terms of the given quantities.

I remember that (a + b + c)^2 = a² + b² + c² + 2(ab + bc + ac). So, if I can find (a + b + c), I can get a² + b² + c² as (a + b + c)^2 - 2(ab + bc + ac) = (a + b + c)^2 - 54.

So, a² + b² + c² = (a + b + c)^2 - 54.

So, if I can find (a + b + c), then I can find a² + b² + c².

But I don't know (a + b + c) directly. Hmm. Maybe I can relate it to the volume. So, I have abc =23.

So, perhaps I can let x = a, y = b, z = c, and then we have the equations:

x + y + z = S (let me denote this as S for sum),

xy + yz + zx = 27,

xyz = 23.

These are the standard symmetric sums for a cubic equation. So, if I can find S, then I can find a² + b² + c².

Alternatively, maybe I can use Lagrange multipliers to maximize a² + b² + c² given the constraints. Hmm, but that might be a bit complicated.

Wait, let's see. The problem is to maximize a² + b² + c² subject to ab + bc + ac = 27 and abc =23.

This seems like an optimization problem with two constraints. So, perhaps I can use the method of Lagrange multipliers here.

Let me set up the function to maximize: f(a, b, c) = a² + b² + c².

Constraints:

g(a, b, c) = ab + bc + ac - 27 = 0,

h(a, b, c) = abc -23 = 0.

So, using Lagrange multipliers, I need to set the gradient of f equal to λ times gradient of g plus μ times gradient of h.

Compute gradients:

∇f = (2a, 2b, 2c),

∇g = (b + c, a + c, a + b),

∇h = (bc, ac, ab).

So, equations:

2a = λ(b + c) + μ bc,

2b = λ(a + c) + μ ac,

2c = λ(a + b) + μ ab.

Hmm, these are three equations. Also, we have the constraints:

ab + bc + ac =27,

abc=23.

That's a system of five equations with five variables: a, b, c, λ, μ.

This seems complicated, but perhaps we can find symmetric properties or assume some variables are equal.

In optimization problems, often extrema occur when variables are equal or some are equal and others are different.

Let me check whether a = b = c is possible here.

If a = b = c, then ab + bc + ac = 3a² =27 => a² =9 => a=3.

Then volume would be a³=27. But our volume is 23, which is less than 27. So, a = b = c is not possible.

So, the maximum probably occurs when two variables are equal, and the third is different. Let me assume that a = b ≠ c.

So, let's let a = b, then we can write the constraints in terms of a and c.

So, ab + bc + ac = a² + 2ac =27,

and abc = a² c =23.

We can solve for a² c =23 => c =23/(a²)

Substitute into the first equation:

a² + 2a*(23/(a²)) =27.

Simplify:

a² + (46/a) =27.

Multiply both sides by a:

a³ +46 =27a,

=> a³ -27a +46=0.

Let me try to solve this cubic equation.

Maybe rational roots? Possible rational roots are factors of 46 over 1, so ±1, ±2, ±23, ±46.

Testing a=1: 1 -27 +46=20 ≠0.

a=2: 8 -54 +46= 0. Oh, a=2 is a root.

So, factor it: (a -2)(a² + 2a -23)=0.

Set equal to zero, so a=2, or a = [-2 ± sqrt(4 +92)]/2 = [-2 ± sqrt(96)]/2 = [-2 ± 4*sqrt(6)]/2 = (-1 ± 2√6).

Since a is positive, we can ignore the negative root. So, a = -1 + 2√6 ≈ -1 + 4.898 ≈ 3.898.

So, the roots are a=2, a= -1 + 2√6.

So, for a=2, c=23/(a²)=23/4=5.75.

So, the sides are a=2, b=2, c=23/4.

Compute the space diagonal squared:

a² + b² + c² =4 +4 + (23/4)^2 =8 + (529/16) = (128/16) +529/16= 657/16 ≈41.0625.

Alternatively, for a=-1 + 2√6, let's compute c:

c=23/(a²)=23/[ (-1 + 2√6)^2 ].

Compute denominator:

(-1 + 2√6)^2 = 1 -4√6 + (2√6)^2 =1 -4√6 +24=25 -4√6.

So, c=23/(25 -4√6).

Rationalize the denominator:

Multiply numerator and denominator by (25 +4√6):

c=23*(25 +4√6)/[ (25)^2 - (4√6)^2 ]=23*(25 +4√6)/(625 - 96)=23*(25 +4√6)/529.

Simplify, 529=23², so 23 cancels:

c=(25 +4√6)/23.

So, c=25/23 + (4√6)/23.

Now, compute a² + b² + c². Since a = b, and a = -1 + 2√6, then a² =25 -4√6.

So, a² +b² =2*(25 -4√6)=50 -8√6.

c² is [ (25 +4√6)/23 ]^2.

Compute that:

(25 +4√6)^2 =625 + 200√6 + 16*6=625 +200√6 +96=721 +200√6.

So, c²= (721 +200√6)/(23²)= (721 +200√6)/529.

So, total a² + b² + c²= (50 -8√6) + (721 +200√6)/529.

Convert to same denominator:

50 =50*529/529=26450/529,

-8√6= -8√6*529/529= let's compute it as -4232√6/529.

Add 721/529 +200√6/529:

Total numerator: 26450 -4232√6 +721 +200√6.

Wait, wait, this seems complicated. Let's compute numerator:

50*529 =50*(500 +29)=25000 +1450=26450.

Similarly, -8√6 *529= - (8*529)√6= -4232√6.

Then, 721 +200√6.

So, adding them all together:

Numerator =26450 +721 + (-4232√6 +200√6) =27171 -4032√6.

So, a² +b² +c²= (27171 -4032√6)/529.

Hmm, that's approximately:

27171 ≈27171,

4032√6 ≈4032*2.449≈4032*2.449≈about 4032*2=8064, 4032*0.449≈1809, total≈9873.

So, 27171 -9873≈17300 approx. So, 17300 /529≈approx 32.7.

Wait, but earlier, when a=2, c=23/4=5.75, the a² +b² +c² was 657/16≈41.0625, which is larger than 32.7. So, which one is the maximum?

Wait, but wait. We're trying to maximize a² +b² +c², so 41 is bigger than 32.7, so the case where a=2, b=2, c=23/4 gives a larger space diagonal. So, perhaps that is the maximum.

But wait, why is the other solution giving a smaller value? Maybe the maximum occurs when two variables are equal, the other is different.

So, perhaps the maximum is 657/16.

But let me check if this is correct.

Alternatively, maybe the maximum occurs when one variable is as large as possible, and the others as small as possible, given the constraints.

Wait, but with a fixed volume, making one side longer would require the others to be shorter, but surface area is fixed. So, it's a balance.

Alternatively, perhaps I should check if the case where a=2, b=2, c=5.75 is indeed the maximum.

So, in that case, the space diagonal squared is 657/16, so r squared is 657/(16*4)=657/64. Wait, no, wait: r= d/2, so r squared= (a² +b² +c²)/4.

So, if a² +b² +c²=657/16,

then r²= (657/16)/4=657/64.

Wait, 657 and 64: 64 is 2^6, 657 divided by 3 is 219, 219 divided by 3 is 73. So, 657=3²*73.

64 is 2^6, so no common factors. So, 657/64 is reduced, so p=657, q=64, p+q=721.

Wait, but is that correct? Let me think again.

Wait, when a=2, b=2, c=23/4, the space diagonal squared is a² +b² +c²=4 +4 + (23/4)^2=8 + (529/16)= (128 +529)/16=657/16.

So, yes, then r squared is (657/16)/4=657/64.

So, 657 divided by 64 is 10.265625.

But wait, is this the maximum? Could there be another case where a² +b² +c² is larger?

Wait, suppose that a is larger, b and c are smaller. Let's think about that.

Suppose a is approaching infinity. But then, since the volume is fixed at 23, either b or c must approach zero, but with fixed surface area, maybe that's not possible.

Wait, no, because if a becomes very large, then to maintain the volume at 23, the product of b and c must be 23/a, which approaches zero as a approaches infinity. But then, the surface area 2(ab + bc + ac) would have ab and ac terms. Since a is large, and b and c are small, the terms ab and ac would dominate, making the surface area very large, but our surface area is fixed at 54. So, a can't become too large.

So, perhaps the maximum occurs when two variables are equal, as in the case above.

Alternatively, perhaps we can find a way to parametrize the problem.

Another approach: Let me consider that for fixed surface area and volume, the box with maximum space diagonal would be the one where two sides are equal, as per the earlier case.

So, perhaps the case a=b=2, c=23/4 is indeed the maximum.

But to be thorough, perhaps I can check if another case where a≠b≠c could result in a larger space diagonal.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use the method of Lagrange multipliers again, but considering that the problem is symmetric when two variables are equal, so perhaps the maximum occurs when two variables are equal.

Therefore, perhaps the case a=b=2, c=23/4 is indeed the maximum.

Thus, the maximum space diagonal squared is 657/16, so r squared is 657/(16*4)=657/64.

So, 657 and 64 are coprime because 657 is 3^2*73 and 64 is 2^6, so yes, they have no common factors.

So, p=657, q=64, p+q=721.

Wait, but wait, just to make sure, I should check whether this is indeed the maximum.

Wait, another approach: Using the method of Lagrange multipliers, let's see if the point a=2, b=2, c=5.75 is a critical point.

We had the equations:

2a = λ(b + c) + μ bc,

2b = λ(a + c) + μ ac,

2c = λ(a + b) + μ ab.

Given a=2, b=2, c=23/4=5.75.

Let me compute each term.

First, compute b + c=2 +5.75=7.75,

a + c=2 +5.75=7.75,

a + b=4.

Compute bc=2 *5.75=11.5,

ac=2*5.75=11.5,

ab=4.

So, the first equation:

2a=2*2=4,

λ(b + c)=λ*7.75,

μ bc=μ*11.5.

So, 4=7.75λ +11.5μ.

Similarly, the second equation: same as the first, since a=b.

Third equation:

2c=2*5.75=11.5,

λ(a + b)=λ*4,

μ ab=μ*4.

So, 11.5=4λ +4μ.

So, now we have two equations:

7.75λ +11.5μ =4,

4λ +4μ =11.5.

Let me write them as:

Equation 1: 7.75λ +11.5μ =4,

Equation 2:4λ +4μ =11.5.

Let me solve these equations for λ and μ.

First, equation 2: divide both sides by 4:

λ + μ=11.5/4=2.875.

So, equation 2a: λ=2.875 - μ.

Substitute into equation1:

7.75*(2.875 - μ) +11.5μ =4.

Compute 7.75*2.875:

Well, 7.75 is 31/4, 2.875 is 23/8.

31/4 *23/8= (31*23)/(4*8)=713/32≈22.28125.

Then, 7.75*(-μ)= -7.75μ.

So, equation becomes:

22.28125 -7.75μ +11.5μ=4.

Combine like terms:

22.28125 + (11.5 -7.75)μ=4,

22.28125 +3.75μ=4,

3.75μ=4 -22.28125= -18.28125.

Thus, μ= -18.28125 /3.75= let's compute this.

18.28125 /3.75: 3.75*4=15, 3.75*4.8=18 (since 0.8*3.75=3), so 4.8.

So, 18.28125 is 18 +0.28125.

3.75*4.8=18, 0.28125 /3.75=0.075.

So, 4.8 +0.075=4.875.

So, μ= -4.875.

Then, λ=2.875 - (-4.875)=2.875 +4.875=7.75.

So, λ=7.75, μ=-4.875.

So, now we can check whether these values satisfy equation1:

7.75*7.75 +11.5*(-4.875)=?

Wait, no, equation1 is 7.75λ +11.5μ=4.

So, 7.75*7.75 +11.5*(-4.875)=?

Compute 7.75*7.75:

7.75^2 = (31/4)^2=961/16=60.0625.

11.5*(-4.875)= let's compute 11.5*4.875.

11.5 *4=46,

11.5*0.875=10.0625,

Total=46 +10.0625=56.0625.

So, 11.5*(-4.875)= -56.0625.

So, total equation1:60.0625 -56.0625=4. Which matches.

So, yes, the values λ=7.75 and μ=-4.875 satisfy both equations.

Thus, this critical point is valid.

So, since we found a critical point where a=2, b=2, c=5.75, and the space diagonal squared is 657/16, which gives r squared as 657/64, which is 10.265625.

Now, to check if this is indeed the maximum, perhaps we can consider another case where a, b, c are all different.

Alternatively, perhaps this is the only critical point, so it must be the maximum.

But wait, to be thorough, maybe I can consider another case where a, b, c are all different.

Wait, perhaps I can set a different ratio.

Alternatively, maybe I can take another approach.

Let me consider that the problem is to maximize a² +b² +c² given ab + bc + ac=27 and abc=23.

I can use the method of substitution.

Let me denote S = a + b + c,

P=abc=23,

and Q=ab + bc + ac=27.

We know that a, b, c are the roots of the cubic equation x³ - Sx² + Qx - P=0, which is x³ - Sx² +27x -23=0.

But without knowing S, it's hard to proceed.

Alternatively, we can express a² +b² +c²= S² - 2Q= S² -54.

So, to maximize a² +b² +c², we need to maximize S².

So, find the maximum possible value of S.

But how?

Given that abc=23, ab + bc + ac=27.

We can use AM >= GM on ab + bc + ac.

Wait, (ab + bc + ac)/3 >= (a b c)^{2/3}.

So, 27/3=9 >= (23)^{2/3}.

Compute 23^{2/3}: cube root of 23 squared.

23^(1/3)≈2.843,

So, 2.843^2≈8.085.

So, 9 >=8.085, which is true.

So, equality would hold when ab=bc=ac, i.e., when a=b=c. But as we saw earlier, that's not possible here because a=b=c would imply abc=a^3=23, so a≈2.843, but then ab + bc + ac=3a²=3*(2.843)^2≈24.24, which is greater than 27? Wait, no, 3a²=3*(8.085)=24.255, which is less than 27.

Wait, but in reality, when a=b=c, ab + bc + ac=3a²=27 => a=3, which would give abc=27, but our abc is 23, so it's not possible. So, the inequality is not tight here.

Alternatively, perhaps we can use the AM >= GM on the variables.

But perhaps another approach is to fix two variables and express the third in terms of them.

Alternatively, use the method of Lagrange multipliers for two constraints.

Earlier, we found a critical point when a=b=2, c=5.75.

Is there another critical point where a≠b≠c?

Possibly, but that would be more complicated to solve.

Alternatively, perhaps it's the only critical point, so it must be the maximum.

But to be thorough, perhaps I can consider another case.

Suppose a=1, then bc=23,

ab + bc + ac= b + c + bc=27.

But bc=23, so b + c +23=27 => b + c=4.

But with bc=23, the quadratic equation would be x² -4x +23=0. The discriminant is 16 -92= -76 <0, which is impossible, so a=1 is not possible.

Similarly, try a=3,

Then bc=23/3,

ab + bc + ac=3b +3c + bc=27.

But bc=23/3,

So, 3(b + c) +23/3=27,

Multiply by3:9(b + c)+23=81,

9(b + c)=58,

b + c=58/9≈6.444.

So, bc=23/3≈7.666.

So, the quadratic is x² - (58/9)x +23/3=0.

Compute discriminant: (58/9)^2 -4*(23/3)= (3364/81) - (92/3)= (3364 - 2484)/81= (880)/81>0.

So, real roots exist.

Thus, a=3 is possible, but the box would have sides 3, b, c.

Compute a² +b² +c²=9 + b² +c².

We can compute b² +c²= (b + c)^2 - 2bc= (58/9)^2 -2*(23/3)= (3364/81) - (46/3)= (3364 - 1338)/81=2026/81≈25.01.

So, a² +b² +c²≈9 +25.01≈34.01.

Which is less than 657/16≈41.0625.

So, a=3 case gives smaller space diagonal squared.

Similarly, for a=4,

Then bc=23/4=5.75,

ab + bc + ac=4b +4c +5.75=27,

So, 4(b + c)=27 -5.75=21.25,

Thus, b + c=21.25/4≈5.3125.

Then, bc=5.75,

So, the quadratic is x² -5.3125x +5.75=0.

Discriminant: (5.3125)^2 -4*5.75≈28.21 -23=5.21>0.

Thus, real roots exist.

Compute a² +b² +c²=16 + (b² +c²).

b² +c²= (b + c)^2 -2bc= (5.3125)^2 -2*5.75≈28.21 -11.5≈16.71.

Thus, a² +b² +c²≈16 +16.71≈32.71.

Which is again less than 41.06.

So, the maximum seems to occur when a=b=2, c=5.75.

Thus, I think this is indeed the maximum, so the minimal enclosing sphere has radius squared 657/64.

Thus, p=657, q=64, p+q=721.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To solve the problem, we start by considering a rectangular box with side lengths \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\). The surface area is given by \(2(ab + bc + ac) = 54\), so \(ab + bc + ac = 27\). The volume is given by \(abc = 23\).

The radius \(r\) of the smallest sphere that can contain the box is half the space diagonal of the box. The space diagonal \(d\) is given by \(\sqrt{a^2 + b^2 + c^2}\), so \(r = \frac{d}{2}\) and \(r^2 = \frac{a^2 + b^2 + c^2}{4}\).

To find the maximum value of \(a^2 + b^2 + c^2\), we use the identity:
\[
(a + b + c)^2 = a^2 + b^2 + c^2 + 2(ab + bc + ac)
\]
From this, we can express \(a^2 + b^2 + c^2\) as:
\[
a^2 + b^2 + c^2 = (a + b + c)^2 - 2(ab + bc + ac) = (a + b + c)^2 - 54
\]

We then assume \(a = b\) to simplify the problem. Substituting \(a = b\) into the constraints:
\[
a^2 + 2ac = 27 \quad \text{and} \quad a^2 c = 23
\]
Solving for \(c\) in terms of \(a\), we get:
\[
c = \frac{23}{a^2}
\]
Substituting this into the surface area equation:
\[
a^2 + 2a \left(\frac{23}{a^2}\right) = 27 \implies a^2 + \frac{46}{a} = 27
\]
Multiplying through by \(a\) and rearranging:
\[
a^3 - 27a + 46 = 0
\]
Testing possible rational roots, we find \(a = 2\) is a solution. Substituting \(a = 2\), we get \(c = \frac{23}{4} = 5.75\).

Thus, the side lengths are \(a = b = 2\) and \(c = 5.75\). The space diagonal squared is:
\[
a^2 + b^2 + c^2 = 2^2 + 2^2 + \left(\frac{23}{4}\right)^2 = 4 + 4 + \frac{529}{16} = \frac{657}{16}
\]
Therefore, \(r^2 = \frac{657}{16 \times 4} = \frac{657}{64}\).

Since 657 and 64 are coprime, the fraction is in simplest form. Thus, \(p = 657\) and \(q = 64\), giving \(p + q = 721\).

\boxed{721}
