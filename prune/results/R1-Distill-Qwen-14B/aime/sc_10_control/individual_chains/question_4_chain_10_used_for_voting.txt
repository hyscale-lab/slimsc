Okay, so I've got this problem where Alice and Bob are playing a game with a stack of n tokens. They take turns, Alice goes first. Each turn, a player can remove either 1 or 4 tokens. The person who takes the last token wins. I need to find how many positive integers n ≤ 2024 allow Bob to have a winning strategy, no matter how Alice plays.

Hmm, let's think about game theory here. This seems like an impartial game, so maybe I can model it using the concept of winning and losing positions. A winning position is one where the current player can force a win no matter what the opponent does. A losing position is the opposite; no matter what the current player does, the opponent can force a win.

So, the key is to find all the losing positions n. Because if n is a losing position, then Bob can win if he's the second player. Wait, wait. Let me get this straight. In this problem, Alice goes first. So, if n is a winning position, Alice can win. If n is a losing position, then Bob can win because Alice is forced into a losing spot no matter what she does.

So, I need to find all n ≤ 2024 where n is a losing position for the first player (Alice), which makes it a winning position for Bob.

To figure out the losing positions, I can use dynamic programming. Let's define a function f(n) that returns True if the current player can force a win from n tokens, and False otherwise.

The base cases are:
- f(0): If there are no tokens, the player can't move, so they lose. But wait, in this game, the player who removes the last token wins. So, if n=0, it's the end, but the current player can't make a move. So, f(0) would be False because the player can't win.
- For n=1: The player can take 1 token and win. So f(1)=True.
- For n=4: The player can take 4 tokens and win. So f(4)=True.
- What about n=2: The player can take 1 token, leaving 1 token for the opponent, who can then take it and win. Or take 4, but that's not possible. So the player can only take 1, leaving the opponent in a winning position. So f(2)=False? Wait, no. Wait, if the player takes 1, opponent gets 1 and takes it to win. So the player can't win, so f(2) is False?

Wait, maybe I should think in terms of next moves. For each n, if there exists a move (taking 1 or 4) such that the next state is a losing position for the opponent, then the current n is a winning position. Otherwise, it's a losing position.

So, let's formalize this:

f(n) = (f(n-1) is False) || (f(n-4) is False)

Because the current player can choose to take 1, leading to n-1, or take 4, leading to n-4. If either of those options leads to the opponent being in a losing position, then the current position is a winning one.

So, f(n) is True if either f(n-1) or f(n-4) is False.

Let's work out some small n.

n=0: f(0)=False (base case)
n=1: f(1)=True (can take 1, wins)
n=2: f(2)= f(1) || f(-2). Wait, f(-2) is invalid, so only f(1). Since f(1)=True, can the current player make a move that leaves the opponent in a losing position? Taking 1 would leave n=1, which is a win for the opponent. So f(2)= True? Wait, no. Wait, no. Wait, no. Let me think.

Wait, no. The formula is: f(n) is True if either f(n-1) is False or f(n-4) is False. So for n=2, f(n-1)=f(1)=True, and f(n-4)=f(-2) which is invalid, so treated as False? Or should we treat f(k) as False for k <0?

I think for k <0, f(k)=False because you can't have negative tokens. So, for n=2:

f(2) = (f(1) is False) OR (f(-2) is False) → (True is False) OR (False is False) → False OR True → True. Wait, no, that's not right.

Wait, no, the formula is f(n) is True if either f(n-1) is False or f(n-4) is False.

So, for n=2:

f(2) = (f(1) is False) OR (f(-2) is False). f(1) is True, so f(1) is False is False. f(-2) is False, so f(-2) is False is True. So OR of False and True is True. So f(2)=True.

Wait, but that doesn't make sense. If n=2, the player can take 1 token, leaving n=1 for the opponent, who can then take it and win. So the current player (n=2) can't force a win, so f(2) should be False.

Hmm, maybe my formula is incorrect.

Wait, perhaps I got the logic reversed. Let me think again.

If the current player can make a move that leads to the opponent being in a losing position, then the current position is a winning one.

So, f(n) is True if there exists a move (taking 1 or 4 tokens) such that f(n - move) is False.

So, for n=2:

Possible moves: take 1 (leaves n=1, which is a winning position for the opponent). Or take 4 (invalid). So, all possible moves lead to the opponent being in a winning position. Therefore, f(2) is False.

Ah, that makes more sense. So the correct way is:

f(n) is True if either (n-1 >=0 and f(n-1) is False) OR (n-4 >=0 and f(n-4) is False). So, for n=2, since taking 1 leaves n=1 which is a True (winning for opponent), so f(2)=False.

Ok, so let's correct the formula.

f(n) = (n >=1 and not f(n-1)) or (n >=4 and not f(n-4))

So, f(n) is True if any of the possible next moves leads to a losing position for the opponent.

So, let's compute f(n) step by step for small n.

n=0: f(0)=False (can't move)
n=1: f(1)= (f(0) is False) → True
n=2: f(2)= (f(1) is False) → False OR (n=2-4 <0, so no) → so f(2)=False OR False → False?
Wait, no, because n=2 is >=1, so the first condition is f(1) is False? But f(1) is True. So f(2)= False.

n=3: f(3)= (f(2) is False) OR (f(-1) is False). f(2) is False, so f(3)=True OR something. So f(3)=True.

n=4: f(4)= (f(3) is False) OR (f(0) is False). f(3) is True, so f(3) is False is False. f(0) is False, so f(0) is False is True. So f(4)=True.

n=5: f(5)= (f(4) is False) OR (f(1) is False). f(4) is True, so False. f(1) is True, so False. So f(5)= False OR False → False.

Wait, let's tabulate this.

n | f(n)
0 | F
1 | T
2 | F
3 | T
4 | T
5 | F
6 | ?
Let's compute f(6):

f(6)= (f(5) is False) OR (f(2) is False). f(5)=False → True. So f(6) is True.

n=6: True

n=7:

f(7)= (f(6) is False) OR (f(3) is False). f(6)=True → False. f(3)=True → False. So f(7)= False OR False → False.

n=7: False

n=8:

f(8)= (f(7) is False) OR (f(4) is False). f(7)=False → True. So f(8)=True.

n=8: True

n=9:

f(9)= (f(8) is False) OR (f(5) is False). f(8)=True → False. f(5)=False → True. So f(9)= False OR True → True.

n=9: True

n=10:

f(10)= (f(9) is False) OR (f(6) is False). f(9)=True → False. f(6)=True → False. So f(10)=False.

n=10: False

n=11:

f(11)= (f(10) is False) OR (f(7) is False). f(10)=False → True. So f(11)=True.

n=11: True

n=12:

f(12)= (f(11) is False) OR (f(8) is False). f(11)=True → False. f(8)=True → False. So f(12)=False OR False → False.

Wait, no, wait. Wait, f(12)= (f(11) is False) OR (f(8) is False). f(11)=True → f(11) is False is False. f(8)=True → f(8) is False is False. So f(12)=False OR False → False.

Wait, but that seems to be a pattern.

Let me list the computed f(n):

n=0: F
1: T
2: F
3: T
4: T
5: F
6: T
7: F
8: T
9: T
10: F
11: T
12: F
13: T
14: T
15: F
16: T
17: F
18: T
19: T
20: F
... and so on.

Hmm, so looking at the pattern:

n | f(n)
0 | F
1 | T
2 | F
3 | T
4 | T
5 | F
6 | T
7 | F
8 | T
9 | T
10| F
11| T
12| F
13| T
14| T
15| F
16| T
17| F
18| T
19| T
20| F

I notice a cycle every 5 numbers. Let's see:

From n=0 to n=4:

F, T, F, T, T

n=5: F

n=6: T

n=7: F

n=8: T

n=9: T

n=10: F

So the pattern is: F, T, F, T, T, F, T, F, T, T, F, T, F, T, T, F, etc.

Wait, so the cycle seems to be 5: F, T, F, T, T

Then again F, T, F, T, T, etc.

So the losing positions (f(n)=False) are at n=0,2,5,7,10,12,15,17,20,...

Each losing position seems to be spaced by adding 3, then 3, then 2, then 3, then 3, etc. Wait, no, looking at the numbers:

0, 2,5,7,10,12,15,17,20,...

The differences between consecutive terms:

2-0=2

5-2=3

7-5=2

10-7=3

12-10=2

15-12=3

17-15=2

20-17=3

So the pattern is alternating between adding 2 and 3: 2,3,2,3,2,3, etc.

So starting from 0:

0 +2=2

2 +3=5

5 +2=7

7 +3=10

10 +2=12

12 +3=15

15 +2=17

17 +3=20

And so on.

So the losing positions are numbers congruent to 0 or 2 modulo 5?

Wait, let's check n=0: 0 mod5=0 → losing

n=2: 2 mod5=2 → losing

n=5:5 mod5=0 → losing

n=7:7 mod5=2 → losing

n=10:10 mod5=0 → losing

n=12:12 mod5=2 → losing

n=15:15 mod5=0 → losing

Yes, that's correct. So the losing positions are n where n mod5 is 0 or 2.

Wait, let's check n=20:20 mod5=0 → losing.

n=22:22 mod5=2 → losing.

Yes, that seems consistent.

So, in general, the losing positions are n ≡0 mod5 or n≡2 mod5.

So, to confirm, let's see:

n=22: f(22)= ?

Based on the pattern, yes, it's a losing position.

But let's compute f(22) using the formula.

f(22)= (f(21) is False) OR (f(18) is False)

Compute f(21):

f(21)= (f(20) is False) OR (f(17) is False)

f(20)=False, so (f(20) is False)=True. So f(21)=True.

f(18)= (f(17) is False) OR (f(14) is False)

f(17)=False → f(17) is False is True.

f(14)=True → f(14) is False is False.

So f(18)=True OR False= True.

So f(22)= (f(21) is False) OR (f(18) is False) → (False is False) OR (True is False) → True OR False → True. Wait, that's not matching the earlier pattern.

Wait, hold on, something's wrong here. Because according to the cycle, n=22 should be a losing position, so f(22) should be False.

But according to the computation:

f(22)= (f(21) is False) OR (f(18) is False)

f(21) is True → f(21) is False is False.

f(18) is True → f(18) is False is False.

So f(22)=False OR False→False. Wait, that contradicts my earlier conclusion. Wait, no, I think I made a mistake in computing f(18).

Wait, f(18)= (f(17) is False) OR (f(14) is False)

f(17)=False → so (f(17) is False)=True.

So f(18)=True OR something → True.

Therefore, f(22)= (False) OR (f(18) is False). f(18)=True → (f(18) is False)=False.

So f(22)=False OR False → False. So f(22)=False. So that's correct.

Wait, earlier I thought that the losing positions are n≡0 or 2 mod5, but n=5: f(5)=False, yes. n=10:False, n=15:False, n=20:False, n=22:False. Wait, n=22 is 22 mod5=2, yes.

Wait, so the losing positions are n where n mod5 is 0 or 2.

So, in the range 1 to 2024, how many numbers are ≡0 or 2 mod5?

So, the numbers are:

For mod5=0: 5,10,15,...,2020,2025 (but 2025>2024, so up to 2020)

For mod5=2:2,7,12,...,2022,2027 is beyond 2024, so up to 2022.

So, let's compute the count.

First, for mod5=0:

The sequence is 5,10,...,2020.

Number of terms: (2020 -5)/5 +1= (2015)/5 +1=403 +1=404.

Wait, (2020 -5)/5 =2015/5=403. So 403+1=404 terms.

For mod5=2:

The sequence is 2,7,12,...,2022.

Find the number of terms.

The first term is 2, last term is 2022.

Common difference is 5.

Number of terms: ((2022 -2)/5)+1= (2020/5)+1=404 +1=405.

Wait, 2022-2=2020, which is 5*404=2020. So number of terms is 404 +1=405.

So total losing positions from 1 to 2024 are 404 +405=809.

Wait, but wait a second. Let me confirm.

Wait, n=0 is a losing position, but the problem states positive integers n, so n starts from 1.

So for mod5=0, numbers are 5,10,...,2020. That's 404 numbers.

For mod5=2, numbers are 2,7,...,2022. That's 405 numbers.

So, total is 404+405=809.

But wait, let me check the last term for mod5=2: 2022 is <=2024, yes.

What about 2022+5=2027, which is beyond 2024. So 2022 is indeed the last term.

Hence, total n is 809.

Wait, but let me check the counts again.

For mod5=0: first term 5, last term 2020. The number of terms is (2020 -5)/5 +1= (2015)/5 +1=403 +1=404.

For mod5=2: first term 2, last term 2022. The number of terms is (2022 -2)/5 +1=2020/5 +1=404 +1=405.

So total is 404 +405=809.

So the answer is 809.

Wait, but wait, let me make sure that this pattern holds beyond n=22. Because when we computed f(22), it was a losing position. Let me check n=23.

n=23: f(23)= (f(22) is False) OR (f(19) is False). f(22)=False → True. So f(23)=True.

n=24: f(24)= (f(23) is False) OR (f(20) is False). f(23)=True → False. f(20)=False → True. So f(24)=True OR something? Wait, f(24)= (f(23) is False) OR (f(20) is False). So f(23)=True → (f(23) is False)=False. f(20)=False → (f(20) is False)=True. So f(24)=False OR True → True.

n=25: f(25)= (f(24) is False) OR (f(21) is False). f(24)=True → False. f(21)=True → False. So f(25)=False OR False→ False.

n=25 mod5=0, so it's a losing position.

Yes, that's consistent.

So the pattern holds.

Therefore, in the range 1 to 2024, the losing positions are numbers ≡0 or 2 mod5. Their counts are 404 and 405, respectively.

So total is 809. So the answer is 809.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the number of positive integers \( n \leq 2024 \) for which Bob can guarantee a win, we analyze the game using the concept of winning and losing positions. A position \( n \) is a losing position if the current player cannot force a win, regardless of the opponent's moves.

### Key Observations:
1. **Winning and Losing Positions**: 
   - A position \( n \) is a winning position if the current player can make a move (taking 1 or 4 tokens) that leaves the opponent in a losing position.
   - Conversely, \( n \) is a losing position if all possible moves (taking 1 or 4 tokens) leave the opponent in a winning position.

2. **Pattern Identification**:
   - By computing small values of \( n \), we observe a repeating pattern in the losing positions. Specifically, the losing positions are \( n \) where \( n \equiv 0 \pmod{5} \) or \( n \equiv 2 \pmod{5} \).

### Counting Losing Positions:
- **For \( n \equiv 0 \pmod{5} \)**:
  - The sequence is \( 5, 10, 15, \ldots, 2020 \).
  - Number of terms: \( \frac{2020 - 5}{5} + 1 = 404 \).

- **For \( n \equiv 2 \pmod{5} \)**:
  - The sequence is \( 2, 7, 12, \ldots, 2022 \).
  - Number of terms: \( \frac{2022 - 2}{5} + 1 = 405 \).

### Total Losing Positions:
- Summing both cases, the total number of losing positions \( n \leq 2024 \) is \( 404 + 405 = 809 \).

Thus, there are **809** positive integers \( n \leq 2024 \) where Bob can guarantee a win.

\boxed{809}
