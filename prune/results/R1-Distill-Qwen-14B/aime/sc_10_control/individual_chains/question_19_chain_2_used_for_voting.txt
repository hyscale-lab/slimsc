Okay, so I've got this geometry problem here, and I need to find AB multiplied by AC in triangle ABC. Let me see what information I have. The triangle has a circumradius (R) of 13 and an inradius (r) of 6. Also, the incenter I is perpendicular to the circumcenter O, meaning IA is perpendicular to OI. Hmm, that's an interesting condition. 

First, I remember that in any triangle, the circumradius R is related to the sides a, b, c by the formula R = (a*b*c)/(4*Δ), where Δ is the area of the triangle. The inradius r is related to the area and the semi-perimeter, r = Δ/s, where s is the semi-perimeter, (a+b+c)/2.

Given that IA is perpendicular to OI, that must mean that the line segment from the incenter to vertex A is perpendicular to the segment from the circumcenter to the incenter. I wonder if there's a specific property or theorem that relates this condition to other elements of the triangle.

I recall that in some triangles, like in right-angled triangles, the circumcenter and incenter have particular positions. But this isn't necessarily a right-angled triangle. Maybe I should try to find coordinates for these centers and use coordinate geometry to find the relationship.

Let me try setting up a coordinate system. Maybe place the circumcenter O at the origin (0,0). Then, the incenter I would be somewhere in the plane. Since IA is perpendicular to OI, the vector from I to A is perpendicular to the vector from O to I.

Let me denote vectors. Let vector OI be from O(0,0) to I(h,k), so OI vector is (h,k). Then, vector IA is from I(h,k) to A(x,y), which is (x - h, y - k). The dot product of OI and IA should be zero because they are perpendicular.

So, (h)(x - h) + (k)(y - k) = 0. Which simplifies to hx - h² + ky - k² = 0. Hmm, that's equation one.

But I don't know the coordinates of A, B, or C yet. Maybe I can use some other properties.

I also know that in any triangle, the distance between the incenter and circumcenter is given by the formula OI² = R(R - 2r). Let me check that. Yes, Euler's formula states that OI² = R² - 2Rr. Oh wait, is that right? Euler's formula says OI² = R(R - 2r), so substituting R=13 and r=6, OI² = 13*(13 - 12) = 13*1=13. So OI is sqrt(13).

Wait, but in that case, since O is at (0,0), the incenter I is at some point (h,k) such that h² + k² = (sqrt(13))² =13.

So I have OI² = h² + k² =13.

Also, from the earlier condition, hx + ky = h² + k². Because hx - h² + ky - k² =0 implies hx + ky = h² + k².

But h² + k² is 13, so hx + ky =13.

Hmm, but I don't know the coordinates of point A yet. Maybe it's better to assign coordinates in another way.

Alternatively, maybe I can use trigonometric identities or other triangle properties. Let me remember that in a triangle, the inradius r = Δ/s, and the circumradius R = (a*b*c)/(4Δ). Also, the area Δ can be expressed as r*s.

If I denote the sides opposite to A, B, C as a, b, c respectively, then:

r = Δ/s => Δ = r*s =6s.

Also, R = (a*b*c)/(4Δ) => 13 = (a*b*c)/(4*6s) => a*b*c = 4*6s*13 = 312s.

But I'm not sure if that's directly helpful yet.

Wait, the question asks for AB * AC. In standard notation, AB would be c, and AC would be b. So we're looking for b*c.

So maybe if I can find b*c, that's the answer.

I also know that in a triangle, the product b*c can be expressed in terms of the sides and other elements. Let me recall the formula for the area in terms of sides and angles. The area Δ = (1/2)*b*c*sin A. Also, from the Law of Sines, a = 2R sin A, so sin A = a/(2R).

So, Δ = (1/2)*b*c*(a/(2R)) )= (a*b*c)/(4R). Which connects to the formula for the circumradius. Hmm, but that might not help directly.

Alternatively, perhaps using coordinates is not the best approach. Let me think about other properties.

Given that IA is perpendicular to OI, maybe I can find some relation involving the coordinates of A, I, and O.

But perhaps there's a formula or theorem that directly relates the product of two sides with the given conditions. Let me see.

Wait, I remember that in a triangle, if IA is perpendicular to OI, then certain relations hold between the sides. Maybe I can find a relation involving the sides and the inradius and circumradius.

Alternatively, let's think about vectors again. Let me consider that vector IA is perpendicular to vector OI. So, as before, OI · IA =0.

But perhaps I should express IA in terms of vectors from O. Since O is the circumcenter, OA = OB = OC = R =13.

Let me denote vector OA as vector A, OB as vector B, and OC as vector C. Then, the incenter I can be expressed as (aA + bB + cC)/(a + b + c). Wait, that's the formula for the incenter in terms of vectors.

So, I = (aA + bB + cC)/(a + b + c).

Therefore, vector OI is I - O = I, which is (aA + bB + cC)/(a + b + c).

Vector IA is A - I = A - (aA + bB + cC)/(a + b + c).

So, IA = [ (a + b + c)A - aA - bB - cC ] / (a + b + c )

Simplify numerator: (b + c)A - bB - cC.

So, IA = [ (b + c)A - bB - cC ] / (a + b + c )

Now, the dot product of OI and IA must be zero.

So,

OI · IA = 0.

Compute OI · IA:

[ (aA + bB + cC)/(a + b + c) ] · [ ( (b + c)A - bB - cC ) / (a + b + c) ) ] = 0.

Multiply numerator and denominator:

[ (aA + bB + cC) · ( (b + c)A - bB - cC ) ] / (a + b + c)^2 = 0.

Since the denominator is positive, the numerator must be zero.

So,

(aA + bB + cC) · ( (b + c)A - bB - cC ) = 0.

Let me expand this dot product.

First, distribute each term:

aA · ( (b + c)A ) + aA · ( -bB ) + aA · ( -cC )

+ bB · ( (b + c)A ) + bB · ( -bB ) + bB · ( -cC )

+ cC · ( (b + c)A ) + cC · ( -bB ) + cC · ( -cC )

Let me compute each term:

1. aA · ( (b + c)A ) = a(b + c)(A · A) = a(b + c)|A|² = a(b + c)(13²) since OA is radius 13.

2. aA · (-bB) = -ab (A · B).

3. aA · (-cC) = -ac (A · C).

4. bB · ( (b + c)A ) = b(b + c)(B · A).

5. bB · (-bB) = -b² (B · B) = -b² |B|² = -b²*13².

6. bB · (-cC) = -bc (B · C).

7. cC · ( (b + c)A ) = c(b + c)(C · A).

8. cC · (-bB) = -bc (C · B).

9. cC · (-cC) = -c² (C · C) = -c²*13².

Now, since A, B, C are vectors from the circumcenter, |A|=|B|=|C|=13.

Also, note that (A · B) is equal to |A||B|cos θ, where θ is the angle between vectors A and B, which is equal to angle AOB. The angle AOB is twice the angle ACB in the triangle. Because in a circle, the central angle is twice the inscribed angle. So angle AOB = 2C.

Similarly, angle BOC = 2A, angle AOC = 2B.

But perhaps it's better to express the dot products in terms of the sides.

Wait, in a triangle, the dot product A · B = |A||B|cos(angle AOB) = 13² cos(2C).

Similarly, A · C = 13² cos(2B), and B · C = 13² cos(2A).

But that might complicate things further.

Alternatively, perhaps I can express A · B in terms of the sides a, b, c.

Wait, another approach: In triangle ABC, the sides are a, b, c opposite to angles A, B, C respectively. Then, using the Law of Cosines in triangle AOB: |AB|² = |OA|² + |OB|² - 2 OA OB cos(angle AOB). So, c² = 13² +13² - 2*13*13 cos(2C). So, c² = 2*169 (1 - cos 2C). And 1 - cos 2C = 2 sin² C, so c² = 4*169 sin² C = (2*13 sin C)^2 = (26 sin C)^2. So c = 26 sin C. Similarly, a = 26 sin A, b=26 sin B.

Wait, that's a useful relation. So a, b, c are proportional to the sines of their opposite angles, scaled by 26.

But I also know that in a triangle, a + b + c = 2s, where s is the semi-perimeter.

Now, let me get back to the dot product expression. Let me write down each term with the expressions I have.

So, term 1: a(b + c)(169).

Term 2: -ab (A · B) = -ab * (169 cos(2C)).

Term 3: -ac (A · C) = -ac * (169 cos(2B)).

Term 4: b(b + c) (B · A) = b(b + c) (169 cos(2C)).

Term 5: -b² (169).

Term 6: -bc (B · C) = -bc (169 cos(2A)).

Term 7: c(b + c) (C · A) = c(b + c) (169 cos(2B)).

Term 8: -bc (C · B) = -bc (169 cos(2A)).

Term 9: -c² (169).

So, let's collect like terms.

First, term 1: 169 a(b + c).

Term 5: -169 b².

Term 9: -169 c².

Now, terms 2 and 4: (-ab + b(b + c)) * 169 cos(2C).

Similarly, terms 3 and 7: (-ac + c(b + c)) * 169 cos(2B).

Terms 6 and 8: (-bc - bc) * 169 cos(2A) = (-2bc) * 169 cos(2A).

So, putting this all together:

169 [ a(b + c) - b² - c² + (-ab + b(b + c)) cos(2C) + (-ac + c(b + c)) cos(2B) - 2bc cos(2A) ] = 0.

Divide both sides by 169:

a(b + c) - b² - c² + [ (-ab + b(b + c)) cos(2C) ] + [ (-ac + c(b + c)) cos(2B) ] - 2bc cos(2A) = 0.

Let me simplify each bracketed term.

First, the term with cos(2C):

(-ab + b(b + c)) = b(b + c - a) = b(b + c - a).

Similarly, the term with cos(2B):

(-ac + c(b + c)) = c(b + c - a).

The term with cos(2A) is -2bc.

So, substituting:

a(b + c) - b² - c² + b(b + c - a) cos(2C) + c(b + c - a) cos(2B) - 2bc cos(2A) =0.

Hmm, this is getting complicated. Maybe there's a better approach.

Let me think about other properties. Since IA is perpendicular to OI, perhaps I can find the length of IA. Wait, is there a formula for the length of IA?

Yes, in a triangle, the length from the inradius to a vertex can be found using the formula:

IA = √(r² + (s - a)²),

where r is the inradius and s is the semi-perimeter, and a is the side opposite vertex A.

Wait, I think that's correct. Let me confirm. The formula for the distance from the incenter to vertex A is indeed sqrt(r² + (s - a)^2).

So IA = sqrt(6² + (s - a)^2) = sqrt(36 + (s - a)^2).

But I don't know if that's directly helpful yet.

Alternatively, I also know that in a triangle, the distance between the incenter and circumcenter is sqrt(R(R - 2r)), which in this case is sqrt(13*(13 - 12)) = sqrt(13*1) = sqrt(13). So OI = sqrt(13).

So, OI is sqrt(13), and IA is perpendicular to OI. So triangle OIA is a right triangle with legs OI and IA, and hypotenuse OA.

Wait, OA is the circumradius, which is 13. So, OA =13, OI=sqrt(13), IA=?

From the right triangle OIA, by Pythagoras:

OA² = OI² + IA².

So, 13² = (sqrt(13))² + IA².

169 =13 + IA².

Thus, IA²=156, so IA = sqrt(156) = 2*sqrt(39).

So, IA = 2*sqrt(39).

But from earlier, IA is also sqrt(36 + (s - a)^2).

So,

sqrt(36 + (s - a)^2) = 2*sqrt(39).

Squaring both sides,

36 + (s - a)^2 = 4*39 = 156.

So, (s - a)^2 = 156 - 36 = 120.

Thus, s - a = sqrt(120) = 2*sqrt(30).

So, s = a + 2*sqrt(30).

Hmm, not sure if this helps yet.

Alternatively, maybe I can express the area Δ in two ways. Since Δ = r*s =6s, and also Δ = (a*b*c)/(4R) = (a*b*c)/(4*13) = (a*b*c)/52.

So, 6s = (a*b*c)/52.

Which gives a*b*c = 312s.

But I also have that a*b*c = 312s.

Hmm, but I need to find b*c. Let me think.

Alternatively, perhaps using the formula for the area in terms of inradius and semi-perimeter, and also in terms of sides and angles.

Wait, another approach: In triangle ABC, the product AB * AC is equal to c * b. Let me denote AB = c, AC = b.

So, we need to find b*c.

From the formula, we have:

a*b*c = 312s.

So, if I can express s in terms of a, b, c, and relate it somehow.

s = (a + b + c)/2.

Hmm, but without more information, this might not be straightforward.

Wait, perhaps using the fact that IA is 2*sqrt(39), and IA is the distance from inradius to vertex A.

Alternatively, in triangle AIC, where I is the inradius, but I'm not sure.

Wait, maybe using trigonometric identities in triangle AIO, since we know OI and OA and IA.

Wait, in triangle AIO, which is a right-angled triangle at I, we have OA=13, OI= sqrt(13), IA= 2 sqrt(39).

So, sin(angle OAI) = opposite / hypotenuse = OI / OA = sqrt(13)/13 = 1/sqrt(13).

Similarly, cos(angle OAI) = IA / OA = (2 sqrt(39))/13.

But angle OAI is related to angle BAC. Let me denote angle BAC as A.

Hmm, what is angle OAI? In the triangle AIO, angle at A is angle OAI, which is part of angle BAC.

Wait, actually, point O is the circumradius, which is the center of the circumscribed circle. Point I is the inradius, inside the triangle.

So, angle OAI is part of angle BAC. But I'm not sure exactly how.

Alternatively, maybe we can express angle BAC in terms of the sides.

Wait, from the Law of Cosines, in triangle ABC:

cos A = (b² + c² - a²)/(2bc).

But I'm not sure if that helps directly.

Another angle formula: In a triangle, the angle between AI and the angle bisector is related to the sides. Wait, AI is the angle bisector of angle A.

Hmm, perhaps using the formula for the length of the angle bisector.

Wait, the length of the angle bisector from A to side BC is given by:

d = (2bc cos (A/2)) / (b + c).

But in this case, AI is the length from the incenter to vertex A. Wait, I think the formula for AI is:

AI = (r)/(sin (A/2)).

Wait, earlier I had AI = sqrt(r² + (s - a)^2). So, let's see:

From AI = 2 sqrt(39) = sqrt(36 + (s - a)^2).

Which gave (s - a)^2 = 120, so s - a = sqrt(120).

So, s = a + sqrt(120).

But s is (a + b + c)/2, so:

(a + b + c)/2 = a + sqrt(120).

Multiply both sides by 2:

a + b + c = 2a + 2 sqrt(120).

So, b + c = a + 2 sqrt(120).

Hmm, so b + c = a + 2 sqrt(120).

But I'm not sure yet how to connect this.

Wait, another formula: In a triangle, the distance from the incenter to vertex A is given by:

AI = (r)/(sin (A/2)).

Wait, earlier I had AI = sqrt(r² + (s - a)^2).

Let me compute AI using both expressions.

AI = sqrt(r² + (s - a)^2) = sqrt(36 + (s - a)^2).

Also, AI = r / sin(A/2) => 2 sqrt(39) = 6 / sin(A/2).

So, sin(A/2) = 6 / (2 sqrt(39)) )= 3 / sqrt(39) = sqrt(39)/13.

Wait, sin(A/2) = 3/sqrt(39) = 3*sqrt(39)/39 = sqrt(39)/13.

So, sin(A/2) = sqrt(39)/13.

Then, cos(A/2) = sqrt(1 - (sqrt(39)/13)^2 ) = sqrt(1 - 39/169) = sqrt(130/169) = sqrt(130)/13.

So, cos(A/2) = sqrt(130)/13.

Now, from the formula, AI = r / sin(A/2) = 6 / (sqrt(39)/13) )= 6*13 / sqrt(39) = 78 / sqrt(39) = (78 sqrt(39)) /39 = 2 sqrt(39). Which matches our earlier result.

So, that's consistent.

Now, perhaps using this, we can express other trigonometric functions.

Also, in triangle ABC, the sides can be expressed using the formula:

a = 2R sin A.

Similarly, b = 2R sin B, c = 2R sin C.

So, a = 26 sin A, b=26 sin B, c=26 sin C.

But we can also relate angles using the fact that angle A is related to angle OAI.

Wait, earlier we had in triangle AIO:

sin(angle OAI) = OI / OA = sqrt(13)/13 = 1/sqrt(13).

So, angle OAI = arcsin(1/sqrt(13)).

But angle OAI is part of angle BAC, which is angle A.

So, angle BAC = angle OAI + angle IAI'.

Wait, perhaps not exactly. Since O is the circumradius and I is the inradius, their positions relative to A might affect the angle.

Alternatively, perhaps angle between AI and AO is angle OAI, which is arcsin(1/sqrt(13)).

But I'm not sure. Maybe it's better to think about the coordinates again.

Wait, let me try to express this in terms of vectors. Since we have O at (0,0), and I at (h,k), with h² +k² =13.

Point A is at (x,y), so OA is vector (x,y), and IA is vector (x - h, y -k).

The condition is that OI · IA =0.

So, (h, k) · (x - h, y -k) =0 => h(x - h) + k(y -k) =0.

Which simplifies to hx + ky = h² +k² =13.

But hx + ky =13.

Also, OA is vector (x,y), which has magnitude sqrt(x² + y²)=13, so x² + y²=169.

So, we have two equations:

1. x² + y² =169.

2. h x + k y =13.

But I don't know h, k, x, y. So, perhaps another equation is needed.

Wait, but point I is the incenter, which has coordinates given by ( (a x_A + b x_B + c x_C)/ (a + b + c), (a y_A + b y_B + c y_C)/ (a + b + c) ).

But this might complicate things because I don't know the coordinates of B and C.

Alternatively, perhaps I can express h and k in terms of the sides.

Wait, in barycentric coordinates, the incenter is at (a : b : c), but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to use the formula for the coordinates of the incenter in terms of the sides.

In a triangle with vertices at A(x_A, y_A), B(x_B, y_B), C(x_C, y_C), the incenter I has coordinates:

I_x = (a x_A + b x_B + c x_C)/(a + b + c),

I_y = (a y_A + b y_B + c y_C)/(a + b + c).

So, in our case, since O is at (0,0), and A is at (x,y), and B and C are somewhere else on the circumcircle, we can express I in terms of these coordinates.

But this seems complicated. Maybe instead, use trigonometric properties.

Wait, another approach: Using trigonometric identities, since we know AI, OI, and OA, perhaps we can find angle AIO or something similar.

In triangle AIO, which is right-angled at I, we can find angle at I.

Wait, but we already used that OA² = OI² + IA².

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps using the formula for the distance between incenter and circumradius, which is sqrt(R(R - 2r)).

But in this case, OI = sqrt(13), which equals sqrt(13*(13 - 12)) = sqrt(13*1)=sqrt(13). So, that's correct.

But how does this help?

Wait, maybe using the formula that relates R, r, and the distance OI.

But in this problem, that's already given.

Alternatively, perhaps using the formula that relates the product bc with other elements.

Wait, another thought: In triangle ABC, the product bc can be found using the formula:

bc = 2Δ sin A,

but Δ = r*s =6s, and sin A can be found from the earlier relation.

Wait, sin(A/2) = sqrt(39)/13, so sin A = 2 sin(A/2) cos(A/2) = 2*(sqrt(39)/13)*(sqrt(130)/13) )= 2*sqrt(5070)/169.

Wait, sqrt(5070) is sqrt(5070)=sqrt(39*130)=sqrt(39)*sqrt(130). Hmm, so 2*sqrt(39)*sqrt(130)/169.

But maybe I can express this differently.

Alternatively, from the Law of Sines, a = 2R sin A = 26 sin A.

So, sin A = a/26.

But I don't know a yet.

Wait, but earlier we have s = a + sqrt(120).

Since s = (a + b + c)/2 = a + sqrt(120).

Wait, that would mean that (a + b + c)/2 = a + sqrt(120).

So, a + b + c = 2a + 2 sqrt(120).

So, b + c = a + 2 sqrt(120).

Hmm, so b + c = a + 2 sqrt(120).

But from the Law of Sines, a = 26 sin A, b=26 sin B, c=26 sin C.

So,

26 sin B + 26 sin C = 26 sin A + 2 sqrt(120).

Divide both sides by 26:

sin B + sin C = sin A + (2 sqrt(120))/26.

Simplify (2 sqrt(120))/26 = sqrt(120)/13 = (2 sqrt(30))/13.

So, sin B + sin C = sin A + (2 sqrt(30))/13.

But in triangle ABC, angles A + B + C = π.

So, B + C = π - A.

So, perhaps using the formula sin B + sin C = 2 sin( (B + C)/2 ) cos( (B - C)/2 ) ).

Which is 2 sin( (π - A)/2 ) cos( (B - C)/2 ).

= 2 sin( (π/2 - A/2 ) ) cos( (B - C)/2 )

= 2 cos(A/2 ) cos( (B - C)/2 )

So, sin B + sin C = 2 cos(A/2) cos( (B - C)/2 ).

So, from earlier,

2 cos(A/2) cos( (B - C)/2 ) = sin A + (2 sqrt(30))/13.

We know that cos(A/2 ) = sqrt(130)/13, from earlier.

So,

2*(sqrt(130)/13) * cos( (B - C)/2 ) = sin A + (2 sqrt(30))/13.

Let me compute sin A.

From earlier, sin(A/2 ) = sqrt(39)/13.

So, sin A = 2 sin(A/2) cos(A/2 ) = 2*(sqrt(39)/13)*(sqrt(130)/13 )= 2*sqrt(5070)/169.

Wait, 5070 is 39*130, which is 39*13*10. So sqrt(5070)=sqrt(39*13*10)=sqrt(507)*sqrt(10)=sqrt(39*13)*sqrt(10)=sqrt(507)*sqrt(10).

But this seems complicated. Maybe compute numerically.

Wait, sqrt(39)= approx 6.245, sqrt(130)= approx 11.401, so sqrt(39)*sqrt(130)= approx 6.245*11.401≈71.47.

So, sin A≈ 2*71.47 / (13*13)= approx 142.94 / 169≈0.844.

But perhaps it's better to keep it symbolic.

So,

Left side: 2*(sqrt(130)/13) * cos( (B - C)/2 ) = (2 sqrt(130)/13 ) * cos( (B - C)/2 )

Right side: sin A + (2 sqrt(30))/13 = [2 sqrt(5070)/169 ] + (2 sqrt(30))/13.

Hmm, not sure if this is helpful.

Wait, maybe there's another way. Since in triangle ABC, the product bc can be related to other elements.

Wait, bc = 2Δ sin A = 2*(6s)* sin A.

But s = a + sqrt(120), and a =26 sin A.

So, s =26 sin A + sqrt(120).

Thus,

bc = 2*6*(26 sin A + sqrt(120)) * sin A = 12*(26 sin A + sqrt(120)) sin A.

But bc is the product we need. Hmm, but this seems complicated.

Alternatively, I can express bc in terms of a, b, c.

Wait, from earlier, a*b*c=312s.

So, bc = (312 s)/a.

But s = (a + b + c)/2, which is equal to a + sqrt(120).

So, bc = (312*(a + sqrt(120)))/a.

Hmm.

But I can express a in terms of sin A, as a=26 sin A.

So,

bc = (312*(26 sin A + sqrt(120)))/(26 sin A )= (312/26) * (26 sin A + sqrt(120))/ sin A.

Simplify 312/26 = 12.

So, bc=12*(26 sin A + sqrt(120))/ sin A = 12*(26 + sqrt(120)/sin A ).

Hmm, but I don't know sin A yet.

Wait, earlier we had:

2 cos(A/2 ) cos( (B - C)/2 ) = sin A + (2 sqrt(30))/13.

We know cos(A/2 )= sqrt(130)/13,

So,

2*(sqrt(130)/13)* cos( (B - C)/2 ) = sin A + (2 sqrt(30))/13.

Let me denote phi = (B - C)/2.

So,

(2 sqrt(130)/13) cos phi = sin A + (2 sqrt(30))/13.

But from earlier, sin A = 2 sin(A/2 ) cos(A/2 )= 2*(sqrt(39)/13)*(sqrt(130)/13 )= 2 sqrt(5070)/169.

Wait, 5070= 39*130= (13*3)*13*10=13² *3*10.

So sqrt(5070)=13 sqrt(30).

Thus, sin A=2*(13 sqrt(30))/169= (26 sqrt(30))/169= (2 sqrt(30))/13.

So, sin A= 2 sqrt(30)/13.

So, plugging back into the equation:

(2 sqrt(130)/13) cos phi = (2 sqrt(30)/13 ) + (2 sqrt(30))/13 = (4 sqrt(30))/13.

So,

(2 sqrt(130)/13) cos phi = (4 sqrt(30))/13.

Divide both sides by (2 sqrt(130)/13):

cos phi = (4 sqrt(30)/13 ) / (2 sqrt(130)/13 )= (4 sqrt(30))/(2 sqrt(130)) )= 2 sqrt(30)/sqrt(130).

Simplify sqrt(30)/sqrt(130)=sqrt(30/130)=sqrt(3/13).

So, cos phi=2*sqrt(3/13)= 2 sqrt(39)/13.

Wait, wait, sqrt(30/130)=sqrt(3/13). So, 2*sqrt(3/13) = 2 sqrt(39)/13, because sqrt(3/13)=sqrt(39)/13.

Wait, sqrt(39)=sqrt(13*3), so sqrt(39)/13= sqrt(3)/sqrt(13).

So, 2 sqrt(3)/sqrt(13) = 2 sqrt(39)/13.

So, cos phi= 2 sqrt(39)/13.

But cos phi can't be greater than 1. Let me check this.

Compute 2 sqrt(39)/13.

sqrt(39)= approx 6.245.

So, 2*6.245=12.49. 12.49/13≈0.96.

So cos phi≈0.96, which is fine as it's less than 1.

So, phi= arccos(2 sqrt(39)/13 ).

But phi= (B - C)/2.

So, (B - C)/2 = arccos(2 sqrt(39)/13 ).

Hmm, not sure if this helps yet.

But perhaps using sin phi.

Since cos phi=2 sqrt(39)/13,

sin phi= sqrt(1 - (2 sqrt(39)/13)^2 )= sqrt(1 - (4*39)/169 )= sqrt(1 - 156/169 )= sqrt(13/169 )= sqrt(13)/13.

So, sin phi= sqrt(13)/13.

So, sin( (B - C)/2 )= sqrt(13)/13.

But in triangle ABC, angles B and C are related by B + C = π - A.

So, perhaps using sum and difference formulas.

Let me denote:

Let’s define:

Let S = B + C = π - A.

D = B - C = 2 phi.

So, B = (S + D)/2, C=(S - D)/2.

So, we can write sin B and sin C in terms of S and D.

Wait, from earlier, sin B + sin C = 2 cos(A/2) cos phi.

But we already used that.

Alternatively, using the formula:

sin B + sin C = 2 sin( (B + C)/2 ) cos( (B - C)/2 )= 2 sin( (π - A)/2 ) cos phi.

Which is 2 cos(A/2) cos phi.

Which we already have.

But perhaps also, sin B - sin C = 2 cos( (B + C)/2 ) sin( (B - C)/2 )= 2 cos( (π -A)/2 ) sin phi.

= 2 sin(A/2 ) sin phi.

So, sin B - sin C = 2 sin(A/2 ) sin phi.

We know sin(A/2 )= sqrt(39)/13, sin phi= sqrt(13)/13.

So,

sin B - sin C= 2*(sqrt(39)/13)*(sqrt(13)/13 )= 2*sqrt(507)/169.

Wait, sqrt(507)=sqrt(13*39)=sqrt(13)*sqrt(39)=sqrt(13)*sqrt(13*3)=13*sqrt(3).

So, sqrt(507)=13 sqrt(3).

So,

sin B - sin C= 2*13 sqrt(3)/169= 26 sqrt(3)/169= 2 sqrt(3)/13.

So, we have:

sin B + sin C= sin A + 2 sqrt(30)/13.

sin B - sin C= 2 sqrt(3)/13.

So, adding these two equations:

2 sin B= sin A + 2 sqrt(30)/13 + 2 sqrt(3)/13.

And subtracting:

2 sin C= sin A + 2 sqrt(30)/13 - 2 sqrt(3)/13.

So,

sin B= [ sin A + 2 sqrt(30)/13 + 2 sqrt(3)/13 ] / 2.

sin C= [ sin A + 2 sqrt(30)/13 - 2 sqrt(3)/13 ] / 2.

But we know sin A=2 sqrt(30)/13.

So,

sin B= [ (2 sqrt(30)/13 ) + 2 sqrt(30)/13 + 2 sqrt(3)/13 ] / 2.

= [ 4 sqrt(30)/13 + 2 sqrt(3)/13 ] / 2.

= [ (4 sqrt(30) + 2 sqrt(3)) /13 ] /2.

= (4 sqrt(30) + 2 sqrt(3)) /26.

= (2 sqrt(30) + sqrt(3)) /13.

Similarly,

sin C= [ (2 sqrt(30)/13 ) + 2 sqrt(30)/13 - 2 sqrt(3)/13 ] / 2.

= [4 sqrt(30)/13 - 2 sqrt(3)/13 ] /2.

= (4 sqrt(30) - 2 sqrt(3))/26.

= (2 sqrt(30) - sqrt(3))/13.

So, now we have expressions for sin B and sin C.

But from the Law of Sines, we have:

b=26 sin B=26*(2 sqrt(30) + sqrt(3))/13= 2*(2 sqrt(30) + sqrt(3)).

Similarly, c=26 sin C=26*(2 sqrt(30) - sqrt(3))/13= 2*(2 sqrt(30) - sqrt(3)).

So, b=2*(2 sqrt(30) + sqrt(3)).

c=2*(2 sqrt(30) - sqrt(3)).

Thus, the product bc= [2*(2 sqrt(30) + sqrt(3)) ] * [2*(2 sqrt(30) - sqrt(3)) ].

=4*[ (2 sqrt(30))² - (sqrt(3))² ].

=4*[4*30 - 3 ].

=4*(120 -3 )=4*117=468.

So, AB * AC= b*c=468.

So, the answer is 468.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To solve the problem, we start by noting the given conditions: the circumradius \( R = 13 \), the inradius \( r = 6 \), and \( \overline{IA} \perp \overline{OI} \). Using Euler's formula, the distance between the incenter and circumcenter is \( OI = \sqrt{R(R - 2r)} = \sqrt{13} \).

Since \( \overline{IA} \) is perpendicular to \( \overline{OI} \), triangle \( AIO \) is a right triangle with \( OA = 13 \), \( OI = \sqrt{13} \), and \( IA = 2\sqrt{39} \). Using trigonometric identities and the Law of Sines, we express the sides \( b \) and \( c \) in terms of the angles \( B \) and \( C \). After deriving the necessary relationships and solving for \( \sin B \) and \( \sin C \), we find the product \( b \cdot c \).

The final result is:

\[
\boxed{468}
