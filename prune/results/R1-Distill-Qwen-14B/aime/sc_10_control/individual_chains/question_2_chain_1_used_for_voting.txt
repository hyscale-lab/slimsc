Okay, so I have this problem here with points O, A, and B. O is at (0,0), A is at (1/2, 0), and B is at (0, sqrt(3)/2). So, O is the origin, A is on the x-axis, and B is on the y-axis. They form a triangle, I think. Let me sketch this in my mind. The first quadrant, so all points are positive.

The family F consists of segments PQ of unit length. Each PQ is a segment of length 1, lying in the first quadrant, with P on the x-axis and Q on the y-axis. So, for example, one such segment would be from (a,0) to (0,b) where a and b are positive, and the distance between them is 1. Since the distance between (a,0) and (0,b) is sqrt(a² + b²) = 1, so a² + b² = 1.

So, all these segments PQ lie in the first quadrant, with P on x-axis, Q on y-axis, each of length 1. So, the family F is all such possible segments.

Now, the problem says there's a unique point C on AB, distinct from A and B, that does not belong to any segment from F other than AB. So, AB is one of these segments in F, right? Because AB is from A (1/2, 0) to B (0, sqrt(3)/2). Let me check the length of AB. The distance between A and B is sqrt( (1/2)^2 + (sqrt(3)/2)^2 ) = sqrt(1/4 + 3/4) = sqrt(1) = 1. So, AB is a segment in F.

So, C is a point on AB, but not A or B, and C isn't on any other segment from F except AB. So, C is unique in that sense. Then, we are to find OC², which is the square of the distance from the origin to point C, and express it as p/q with p and q coprime, then find p+q.

Hmm. So, the plan is to find coordinates of C on AB such that C is not on any other segment PQ from F except AB.

First, let's parametrize AB. Since A is (1/2, 0) and B is (0, sqrt(3)/2), the line AB can be parametrized. Let me find the equation of AB. The slope is (sqrt(3)/2 - 0)/(0 - 1/2) = (sqrt(3)/2) / (-1/2) = -sqrt(3). So, the equation is y = -sqrt(3)x + c. Plugging in point A: 0 = -sqrt(3)*(1/2) + c => c = sqrt(3)/2. So, equation of AB is y = -sqrt(3)x + sqrt(3)/2.

Wait, but let me check when x=0, y should be sqrt(3)/2, which matches point B. When y=0, x= (sqrt(3)/2)/sqrt(3) = 1/2. So, correct.

So, any point C on AB can be written as (x, y) where y = -sqrt(3)x + sqrt(3)/2, and x is between 0 and 1/2.

Now, we need to find such a point C that does not lie on any other segment PQ from F except AB.

So, for point C, if we assume it's on another segment PQ in F, then that would mean that C is the intersection point of AB and PQ. But since it's unique, perhaps C is the point where all such PQ's are tangent to the curve from which AB is a secant? Or maybe it's the envelope of all these segments?

Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of the envelope of the family F. The envelope is a curve that is tangent to each member of the family. So, the family F consists of all segments PQ of length 1 from x-axis to y-axis in the first quadrant. Each such segment is a line segment between (a,0) and (0,b) where a² + b² = 1.

So, perhaps the envelope of these segments is a curve, and point C is the point where AB is tangent to this envelope. Then, C would only lie on AB and no other segment from F.

Alternatively, perhaps C is the point where AB is the first tangent to the envelope. So, to find C, I need to find the envelope of the family F.

To find the envelope, we can use the method from calculus. The envelope of a family of curves given by F(x,y,a) = 0 satisfies both F(x,y,a) = 0 and dF/da = 0.

In our case, each PQ is a line segment between (a, 0) and (0, b), with a² + b² = 1. So, the equation of PQ is x/a + y/b = 1. Since a² + b² = 1, we can write the equation as x/a + y/b = 1 with a² + b² = 1.

So, treating a as a parameter, we can write F(x,y,a) = x/a + y/b - 1 = 0. But since a² + b² =1, we can express b in terms of a, b = sqrt(1 - a²). But that would complicate things. Alternatively, perhaps we can write the equation in terms of a single parameter.

Let me consider a as the parameter. So, the equation of each PQ is x/a + y/(sqrt(1 - a²)) = 1.

So, F(x,y,a) = x/a + y/(sqrt(1 - a²)) - 1 = 0.

To find the envelope, we need to solve the system:

F(x,y,a) = 0,

dF/da = 0.

Compute dF/da:

dF/da = (-x)/a² + (y * (1/2)(1 - a²)^(-3/2) * (2a)) ) = 0.

Simplify:

(-x)/a² + (y * a) / ( (1 - a²)^(3/2) ) = 0.

So,

(-x)/a² = - (y a) / ( (1 - a²)^(3/2) )

Multiply both sides by a²:

-x = - y a^3 / ( (1 - a²)^(3/2) )

So,

x = (y a^3 ) / ( (1 - a²)^(3/2) )

But from the original equation, x/a + y / sqrt(1 - a²) =1.

Let me denote sqrt(1 - a²) as b, so b = sqrt(1 -a²). Then, x/a + y/b =1, and we have x = (y a^3 ) / ( b^3 ).

So, substitute x into equation F:

( (y a^3 ) / (b^3) ) / a + y / b = 1

Simplify:

(y a^2 ) / b^3 + y / b = 1

Factor out y / b:

y / b ( a² / b² + 1 ) = 1

But since b² = 1 - a²,

y / b ( a² / (1 - a²) + 1 ) = 1

Simplify inside the parentheses:

a²/(1 - a²) + 1 = (a² + 1 - a²)/ (1 - a²) ) = 1 / (1 - a²)

So,

y / b * (1 / (1 - a²)) ) = 1

But b = sqrt(1 - a²), so 1 - a² = b².

Thus,

y / b * (1 / b² ) = y / b^3 = 1

So,

y = b^3

But b = sqrt(1 - a²), so y = (1 - a²)^(3/2 )

Similarly, from x = (y a^3 ) / b^3, substitute y:

x = ( (1 - a²)^(3/2 ) * a^3 ) / ( (1 - a²)^(3/2 ) ) ) = a^3

So, x = a^3, y = (1 - a²)^(3/2 )

So, parametric equations for the envelope are:

x = a^3

y = (1 - a²)^(3/2 )

We can try to eliminate the parameter a to find the relation between x and y.

From x = a^3, a = x^(1/3)

Substitute into y:

y = (1 - (x^(1/3))^2 )^(3/2 ) = (1 - x^(2/3) )^(3/2 )

So, y = (1 - x^(2/3) )^(3/2 )

We can write this as y² = (1 - x^(2/3))^3

But perhaps it's better to write it in terms of x and y.

Alternatively, take both sides to the power of 2/3:

y^(2/3) = 1 - x^(2/3)

So,

x^(2/3) + y^(2/3) = 1

Ah, that's the equation of an astroid, which is a type of hypocycloid. So, the envelope of the family F is the astroid x^(2/3) + y^(2/3) =1.

So, the astroid is tangent to each segment PQ in F.

So, the astroid is the envelope, and each PQ is a tangent to the astroid.

Now, since point C is on AB and it doesn't lie on any other PQ from F except AB, it must be the point where AB is tangent to the astroid. Because if a point is on AB and the astroid, and AB is a tangent there, then it won't lie on any other PQ from F except AB.

So, our point C is the point of tangency of AB with the astroid.

So, let's find the point where AB is tangent to the astroid.

First, equation of AB: y = -sqrt(3)x + sqrt(3)/2

Equation of astroid: x^(2/3) + y^(2/3) = 1

We can substitute the equation of AB into the astroid equation and find the points of intersection.

Substitute y = -sqrt(3)x + sqrt(3)/2 into x^(2/3) + y^(2/3) =1.

So,

x^(2/3) + ( -sqrt(3)x + sqrt(3)/2 )^(2/3) =1

This seems a bit complicated, but perhaps we can find the point where AB is tangent to the astroid, which would be a single point of intersection with multiplicity two.

Alternatively, since AB is a line, and the astroid is a curve, if AB is tangent to the astroid, then the system has a double root, so the equation will have a repeated solution.

But perhaps it's easier to use calculus. The tangent to the astroid at point (x,y) has slope dy/dx.

Compute dy/dx for the astroid:

Differentiating x^(2/3) + y^(2/3) =1,

(2/3)x^(-1/3) + (2/3)y^(-1/3) dy/dx =0

So,

dy/dx = - (x^(-1/3)) / (y^(-1/3)) ) = - ( y^(1/3) ) / (x^(1/3) )

So, slope of the astroid at (x,y) is - (y^(1/3))/ (x^(1/3) )

But the line AB has slope m = -sqrt(3)

So, at the point of tangency, the slope of the astroid must be equal to -sqrt(3). Therefore,

- ( y^(1/3) ) / (x^(1/3) ) = -sqrt(3 )

Simplify:

(y^(1/3)) / (x^(1/3)) = sqrt(3 )

Raise both sides to the power of 3:

y / x = (sqrt(3))^3 = 3*sqrt(3)

So, y = 3*sqrt(3) x

But also, the point (x,y) is on AB, so y = -sqrt(3)x + sqrt(3)/2

So, set 3 sqrt(3) x = -sqrt(3) x + sqrt(3)/2

Let me solve for x:

3 sqrt(3) x + sqrt(3) x = sqrt(3)/2

Factor sqrt(3) x:

sqrt(3) x (3 +1 ) = sqrt(3)/2

So,

sqrt(3) x *4 = sqrt(3)/2

Divide both sides by sqrt(3):

4 x = 1/2

Thus, x = 1/8

Then, y = 3 sqrt(3) x = 3 sqrt(3) * 1/8 = (3 sqrt(3))/8

So, point C is at (1/8, 3 sqrt(3)/8 )

But wait, let me verify that this point is on AB.

From AB's equation: y = -sqrt(3)x + sqrt(3)/2.

Plugging x=1/8,

y = -sqrt(3)*(1/8) + sqrt(3)/2 = (-sqrt(3)/8 + 4 sqrt(3)/8 ) = (3 sqrt(3))/8. Correct.

So, C is at (1/8, 3 sqrt(3)/8 )

Now, compute OC². OC is the distance from O(0,0) to C(1/8, 3 sqrt(3)/8 )

So,

OC² = (1/8)^2 + (3 sqrt(3)/8)^2 = 1/64 + (27)/64 = (1 +27)/64 = 28/64 = 7/16

Wait, 28/64 simplifies to 7/16. So OC² is 7/16.

Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make any calculation errors.

Compute (1/8)^2: 1/64.

Compute (3 sqrt(3)/8)^2: (9 * 3)/64 = 27/64.

Sum: 1 +27 =28; 28/64 =7/16. Correct.

So, OC²=7/16.

So, p=7, q=16, p+q=23.

But before I conclude, let me just think if this makes sense. The point C is on AB, and it's the point where AB is tangent to the astroid. Thus, it's the only point on AB that doesn't lie on any other PQ from F except AB. So, that must be the point.

I think that's correct.

To solve the problem, we start by identifying the points \( O(0,0) \), \( A\left(\frac{1}{2}, 0\right) \), and \( B\left(0, \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right) \). The line segment \( \overline{AB} \) is part of the family \( \mathcal{F} \) of unit-length segments with endpoints on the axes. The equation of line \( AB \) is found to be \( y = -\sqrt{3}x + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \).

The family \( \mathcal{F} \) consists of segments between points \( (a, 0) \) and \( (0, b) \) where \( a^2 + b^2 = 1 \). The envelope of these segments forms an astroid given by \( x^{2/3} + y^{2/3} = 1 \).

To find the unique point \( C \) on \( \overline{AB} \) that does not lie on any other segment from \( \mathcal{F} \) except \( \overline{AB} \), we determine where \( \overline{AB} \) is tangent to the astroid. The slope of \( \overline{AB} \) is \( -\sqrt{3} \), which must equal the derivative of the astroid at the point of tangency. Solving, we find the coordinates of \( C \) as \( \left(\frac{1}{8}, \frac{3\sqrt{3}}{8}\right) \).

Finally, the distance \( OC \) is calculated as:
\[
OC^2 = \left(\frac{1}{8}\right)^2 + \left(\frac{3\sqrt{3}}{8}\right)^2 = \frac{1}{64} + \frac{27}{64} = \frac{28}{64} = \frac{7}{16}.
\]
Thus, \( OC^2 = \frac{7}{16} \), and \( p + q = 7 + 16 = 23 \).

The final answer is \(\boxed{23}\).
