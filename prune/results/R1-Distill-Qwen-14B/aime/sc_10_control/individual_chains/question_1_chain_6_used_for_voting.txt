Okay, so I've got this problem with three variables x, y, z, all positive real numbers. They're satisfying a system of logarithmic equations, and I need to find the absolute value of log base 2 of (x^4 y^3 z^2), which will be a fraction m/n. Then I have to find m + n.

Let me write down the given equations:

1. log₂(x/(y z)) = 1/2
2. log₂(y/(x z)) = 1/3
3. log₂(z/(x y)) = 1/4

Hmm, logarithms can be tricky, but I remember that log_b(a) = c is equivalent to b^c = a. So maybe I can rewrite each equation in exponential form to make it easier to handle.

Starting with the first equation: log₂(x/(y z)) = 1/2. Converting this, 2^(1/2) = x/(y z). 2^(1/2) is the square root of 2, so sqrt(2) = x/(y z). Let me write that as equation (1a):

(1a) x = y z * sqrt(2)

Similarly, the second equation: log₂(y/(x z)) = 1/3. So 2^(1/3) = y/(x z). Let me write that as equation (2a):

(2a) y = x z * 2^(1/3)

Third equation: log₂(z/(x y)) = 1/4. So 2^(1/4) = z/(x y). Equation (3a):

(3a) z = x y * 2^(1/4)

Okay, so now I have three equations with x, y, z in terms of the others. Maybe I can substitute these into each other to find expressions for x, y, z.

Let me see. From (1a), x is expressed in terms of y and z. From (2a), y is in terms of x and z. From (3a), z is in terms of x and y. So perhaps I can substitute each into the other.

Let me try substituting equation (2a) into equation (1a). So equation (1a) says x = y z * sqrt(2). But y = x z * 2^(1/3), so substituting that into (1a):

x = (x z * 2^(1/3)) * z * sqrt(2)

Simplify that:

x = x z^2 * 2^(1/3) * sqrt(2)

Hmm, let's compute 2^(1/3) * sqrt(2). Since sqrt(2) is 2^(1/2), so 2^(1/3) * 2^(1/2) = 2^(1/3 + 1/2) = 2^( (2 + 3)/6 ) = 2^(5/6). So:

x = x z^2 * 2^(5/6)

Divide both sides by x (assuming x ≠ 0, which it isn't since it's positive):

1 = z^2 * 2^(5/6)

Then, solving for z^2:

z^2 = 1 / (2^(5/6)) = 2^(-5/6)

Take square root:

z = 2^(-5/12), since sqrt(2^(-5/6)) = 2^(-5/12). Since z is positive, we take the positive root.

So z = 2^(-5/12). Let me note this as equation (z).

Now, from equation (3a): z = x y * 2^(1/4). We can plug z into this equation and solve for x y.

So, 2^(-5/12) = x y * 2^(1/4)

Solve for x y:

x y = 2^(-5/12) / 2^(1/4) = 2^(-5/12 - 3/12) = 2^(-8/12) = 2^(-2/3)

So x y = 2^(-2/3). Let me call this equation (xy).

Similarly, let's go back to equation (2a): y = x z * 2^(1/3). We know z from equation (z), so let's substitute that.

y = x * 2^(-5/12) * 2^(1/3)

Compute 2^(-5/12) * 2^(1/3) = 2^(-5/12 + 4/12) = 2^(-1/12). So:

y = x * 2^(-1/12)

So y = x * 2^(-1/12). Let's note this as equation (y).

Now, from equation (xy), x y = 2^(-2/3). But from equation (y), y = x * 2^(-1/12). So substituting y into (xy):

x * (x * 2^(-1/12)) = 2^(-2/3)

Which simplifies to:

x^2 * 2^(-1/12) = 2^(-2/3)

Multiply both sides by 2^(1/12):

x^2 = 2^(-2/3) * 2^(1/12) = 2^(-8/12 + 1/12) = 2^(-7/12)

So x^2 = 2^(-7/12) => x = 2^(-7/24), since x is positive.

Wait, hold on. Let me double-check that exponent.

Wait, 2^(-2/3) is 2^(-8/12). Then 2^(1/12) is 2^(1/12). So when you multiply, exponents add: (-8/12 + 1/12) = (-7/12). So x^2 = 2^(-7/12).

Therefore, x = sqrt(2^(-7/12)) = 2^(-7/24).

So x = 2^(-7/24). Let me write that as equation (x).

Now, from equation (y), y = x * 2^(-1/12). So plug in x:

y = 2^(-7/24) * 2^(-1/12) = 2^(-7/24 - 2/24) = 2^(-9/24) = 2^(-3/8)

So y = 2^(-3/8). Equation (y).

And we already had z = 2^(-5/12). Equation (z).

Now, let me write down all three variables:

x = 2^(-7/24)
y = 2^(-3/8)
z = 2^(-5/12)

To make it easier, let's express all exponents with a common denominator. Let's see, the denominators are 24, 8, and 12. The least common multiple is 24.

So converting each exponent:

x: -7/24 is already over 24.

y: -3/8 = -9/24.

z: -5/12 = -10/24.

So:

x = 2^(-7/24)
y = 2^(-9/24)
z = 2^(-10/24)

Simplify:

x = 2^(-7/24)
y = 2^(-9/24) = 2^(-3/8)
z = 2^(-10/24) = 2^(-5/12)

Okay, now the problem asks for |log₂(x⁴ y³ z²)|.

Let me compute the exponent inside the log first.

Compute x⁴ y³ z².

Since x, y, z are powers of 2, their product will be 2 raised to the sum of their exponents multiplied by their respective powers.

So:

x⁴ = (2^(-7/24))^4 = 2^(-28/24) = 2^(-7/6)
y³ = (2^(-9/24))^3 = 2^(-27/24) = 2^(-9/8)
z² = (2^(-10/24))^2 = 2^(-20/24) = 2^(-5/6)

Now, multiply these together:

x⁴ y³ z² = 2^(-7/6) * 2^(-9/8) * 2^(-5/6) = 2^(-7/6 -9/8 -5/6)

Let me compute the exponents:

First, find a common denominator for the fractions. 6, 8, 6. The least common multiple is 24.

Convert each fraction:

-7/6 = -28/24
-9/8 = -27/24
-5/6 = -20/24

Add them up: (-28 -27 -20)/24 = (-75)/24 = -25/8

So, x⁴ y³ z² = 2^(-25/8)

Therefore, log₂(x⁴ y³ z²) = log₂(2^(-25/8)) = -25/8

The absolute value is | -25/8 | = 25/8.

So the value is 25/8, which is already in lowest terms since 25 and 8 are coprime (no common divisors except 1). So m = 25, n = 8, and m + n = 33.

Wait, just to make sure I didn't make a mistake in the exponents:

Let me double-check the exponents:

x⁴: (-7/24)*4 = -28/24 = -7/6

y³: (-9/24)*3 = -27/24 = -9/8

z²: (-10/24)*2 = -20/24 = -5/6

Sum: (-7/6) + (-9/8) + (-5/6)

Convert to 24ths:

-7/6 = -28/24

-9/8 = -27/24

-5/6 = -20/24

Sum: (-28 -27 -20)/24 = (-75)/24

Simplify: -75/24 = -25/8. Yep, that's correct.

So log₂(x⁴ y³ z²) = -25/8, absolute value is 25/8. So m + n = 25 + 8 = 33.

\boxed{33}

Given the system of equations involving logarithms:

1. \(\log_2\left(\frac{x}{yz}\right) = \frac{1}{2}\)
2. \(\log_2\left(\frac{y}{xz}\right) = \frac{1}{3}\)
3. \(\log_2\left(\frac{z}{xy}\right) = \frac{1}{4}\)

We convert these logarithmic equations to their exponential forms:

1. \(\sqrt{2} = \frac{x}{yz}\) implies \(x = yz \sqrt{2}\)
2. \(2^{1/3} = \frac{y}{xz}\) implies \(y = xz \cdot 2^{1/3}\)
3. \(2^{1/4} = \frac{z}{xy}\) implies \(z = xy \cdot 2^{1/4}\)

Substituting these into each other, we find:

- From \(y = xz \cdot 2^{1/3}\) and \(x = yz \sqrt{2}\), we get \(x = xz^2 \cdot 2^{5/6}\), leading to \(z^2 = 2^{-5/6}\) and \(z = 2^{-5/12}\).
- Using \(z = 2^{-5/12}\) in \(z = xy \cdot 2^{1/4}\), we find \(xy = 2^{-2/3}\).
- Substituting \(y = x \cdot 2^{-1/12}\) into \(xy = 2^{-2/3}\), we solve for \(x\) and find \(x = 2^{-7/24}\) and \(y = 2^{-3/8}\).

Thus, we have:
- \(x = 2^{-7/24}\)
- \(y = 2^{-3/8}\)
- \(z = 2^{-5/12}\)

We need to find \(\left|\log_2(x^4 y^3 z^2)\right|\):

- Compute the exponents: \(x^4 = 2^{-7/6}\), \(y^3 = 2^{-9/8}\), \(z^2 = 2^{-5/6}\).
- Summing the exponents: \(-7/6 - 9/8 - 5/6 = -25/8\).
- Therefore, \(\log_2(x^4 y^3 z^2) = -25/8\) and the absolute value is \(25/8\).

The fraction \(25/8\) is in lowest terms, so \(m = 25\) and \(n = 8\). Thus, \(m + n = 33\).

\(\boxed{33}\)
