Okay, so I have this problem here: I need to find the greatest four-digit number N with a specific property. The property is that if any one of its digits is changed to 1, the resulting number is divisible by 7. Then, I need to find Q + R where Q is the quotient and R is the remainder when N is divided by 1000. So, that means Q is the thousands digit, and R is the last three digits of N.

First, let me break down the problem. N is a four-digit number, so it's between 1000 and 9999. The key property is that changing any single digit to 1 makes the number divisible by 7. I need to find the largest such N.

Let me denote N as a four-digit number: N = ABCD, where A, B, C, D are its digits. So A is the thousands digit, B hundreds, C tens, and D ones. Since it's a four-digit number, A can't be zero.

The problem states that if any one digit is changed to 1, the number becomes divisible by 7. So, that means:

1. Changing A to 1: The new number is 1BCD, and this should be divisible by 7.
2. Changing B to 1: The new number is A1CD, which should be divisible by 7.
3. Changing C to 1: The new number is AB1D, which should be divisible by 7.
4. Changing D to 1: The new number is ABC1, which should be divisible by 7.

So, all four of these modified numbers must be divisible by 7. Our goal is to find the largest possible N, so I should probably start checking from 9999 downwards, but that might take a lot of time. Maybe there's a smarter way.

Let me think about the constraints. Each modified number must be divisible by 7. So, for each digit position, when we change it to 1, the resulting number is 0 mod 7. So, for each digit, N with that digit changed to 1 is congruent to 0 mod 7.

Let me assign each modified number:

1. N1 = 1BCD = 1000 + B*100 + C*10 + D
2. N2 = A1CD = A*1000 + 1*100 + C*10 + D
3. N3 = AB1D = A*1000 + B*100 + 1*10 + D
4. N4 = ABC1 = A*1000 + B*100 + C*10 + 1

Each of these must be divisible by 7.

So, for N1: 1BCD ≡ 0 mod 7 → 1000 + 100B + 10C + D ≡ 0 mod 7
Similarly for the others.

But N itself, ABCD, is equal to 1000A + 100B + 10C + D. Let me denote this as N = 1000A + 100B + 10C + D.

Now, I can express each modified number in terms of N and the digit being changed.

For example, N1 is when A is changed to 1. So, N1 = 1000 + 100B + 10C + D. But N = 1000A + 100B + 10C + D. So, N1 = 1000 + (N - 1000A) = N - 1000A + 1000 = N + (1000 - 1000A). So, N1 = N + 1000(1 - A).

Similarly, N2 is when B is changed to 1. N2 = A*1000 + 100 + 10C + D. N = A*1000 + 100B + 10C + D. So, N2 = N - 100B + 100 = N + 100(1 - B).

Similarly, N3 is when C is changed to 1: N3 = A*1000 + B*100 + 10 + D = N - 10C + 10 = N + 10(1 - C).

N4 is when D is changed to 1: N4 = A*1000 + B*100 + C*10 + 1 = N - D + 1 = N + (1 - D).

So, each N1, N2, N3, N4 can be written in terms of N and the digit being changed.

Since each of these modified numbers must be divisible by 7, we have:

1. N + 1000(1 - A) ≡ 0 mod 7
2. N + 100(1 - B) ≡ 0 mod 7
3. N + 10(1 - C) ≡ 0 mod 7
4. N + (1 - D) ≡ 0 mod 7

Let me denote the congruences as:

1. N ≡ -1000(1 - A) mod 7
2. N ≡ -100(1 - B) mod 7
3. N ≡ -10(1 - C) mod 7
4. N ≡ -(1 - D) mod 7

So, all four congruences must hold for N.

But N is the same in all, so the right-hand sides must be equal mod 7.

So, for each digit, the corresponding expression must be equal mod 7.

So, let's compute each coefficient mod 7 to simplify.

First, 1000 mod 7. Let me compute 1000 /7.

7*142 = 994, 1000 - 994=6. So, 1000 ≡ 6 mod7.

Similarly, 100 mod7: 7*14=98, 100-98=2. So, 100 ≡2 mod7.

10 mod7 is 3, since 7*1=7, 10-7=3.

1 mod7 is 1.

So, substituting:

1. N ≡ -6*(1 - A) mod7
2. N ≡ -2*(1 - B) mod7
3. N ≡ -3*(1 - C) mod7
4. N ≡ -(1 - D) mod7

So, each of these expressions must be equal mod7.

So, let me write each as:

1. N ≡ (6A -6) mod7
2. N ≡ (2B -2) mod7
3. N ≡ (3C -3) mod7
4. N ≡ (-1 + D) mod7

Wait, because -6*(1 - A) = -6 + 6A ≡6A -6 mod7.

Similarly, -2*(1 - B) = -2 +2B ≡2B -2 mod7.

-3*(1 - C) = -3 +3C ≡3C -3 mod7.

-(1 - D) = -1 + D ≡D -1 mod7.

So, all four expressions must be congruent modulo7.

So, all four expressions must be equal.

Therefore:

6A -6 ≡ 2B -2 ≡ 3C -3 ≡ D -1 mod7.

So, let me denote each of these expressions as equal to some value k mod7.

So, 6A -6 ≡k mod7,

2B -2 ≡k mod7,

3C -3 ≡k mod7,

D -1 ≡k mod7.

So, for each digit, we can write:

6A ≡ k +6 mod7,

2B ≡k +2 mod7,

3C ≡k +3 mod7,

D ≡k +1 mod7.

Hmm, that's four equations.

So, for each digit, we can write:

A ≡ (k +6)/6 mod7,

B ≡ (k +2)/2 mod7,

C ≡ (k +3)/3 mod7,

D ≡ (k +1) mod7.

But division in modular arithmetic requires the divisor to be coprime with the modulus.

Mod7, 6, 2, 3 are all coprime with 7.

So, multiplicative inverses exist.

Let me compute the inverses:

Inverse of 6 mod7: 6*6=36≡1 mod7. So, inverse is 6.

Inverse of 2 mod7: 2*4=8≡1 mod7. So, inverse is 4.

Inverse of 3 mod7: 3*5=15≡1 mod7. So, inverse is5.

Inverse of 1 mod7 is 1.

So, now, the equations become:

A ≡ (k +6)*6 mod7,

B ≡ (k +2)*4 mod7,

C ≡ (k +3)*5 mod7,

D ≡ (k +1)*1 mod7.

Let me compute each:

A ≡6k + 36 mod7. 36 mod7: 36/7=5*7=35, 36-35=1. So, 36≡1. So, A≡6k +1 mod7.

Similarly,

B≡4k +8 mod7. 8 mod7=1. So, B≡4k +1 mod7.

C≡5k +15 mod7. 15 mod7=1. So, C≡5k +1 mod7.

D≡k +1 mod7.

So, now, A, B, C, D are digits (0-9), but A cannot be 0.

But since they're congruent mod7, their actual values mod7 are as above.

But digits are from 0-9, so perhaps each digit is equal to the expression mod7, but since digits are 0-9, they can be expressed as 7m + r, where r is the residue.

But since we want the largest N, which is four-digit, A is as large as possible, preferably 9.

But how do these congruences constrain each digit?

Let me think. Since A is 6k +1 mod7, let's think about possible A.

A can be 6k +1 mod7, but A is a digit from 1-9.

Similarly, B is 4k +1 mod7.

C is 5k +1 mod7.

D is k +1 mod7.

But we need to find a k (from 0 to6) such that all digits A, B, C, D are between 0 and9, considering their congruence.

Since we are trying to find the maximum N, which is 9999, but we need to find the largest N meeting the conditions, so we can start from 9999 and go down until we find a number that meets all four conditions.

But that might be time-consuming, but perhaps we can find a pattern or use the congruence relations.

Wait, another approach. Since all four expressions are congruent to k, let's set them equal:

6A -6 ≡2B -2 mod7

Subtracting the two:

6A -6 - (2B -2) ≡0 mod7 →6A -2B -4 ≡0 mod7 →6A -2B ≡4 mod7.

Divide both sides by 2: 3A - B ≡2 mod7.

Similarly, 2B -2 ≡3C -3 mod7.

So, 2B -2 -3C +3 ≡0 mod7 →2B -3C +1 ≡0 mod7.

Similarly, 3C -3 ≡ D -1 mod7 →3C - D -2 ≡0 mod7.

So, from these, we have:

1. 3A - B ≡2 mod7.

2. 2B -3C ≡-1 mod7 → 2B -3C ≡6 mod7 (since -1 mod7 is 6).

3. 3C - D ≡2 mod7.

So, these are the three equations we have.

Also, from N, we know that N must be such that when any digit is changed to 1, the number is divisible by 7. So, N must be such that all four modified numbers are 0 mod7.

But perhaps another approach is to note that N is congruent to each of the expressions above. So, from the four congruences, N must be congruent to:

6A -6 ≡ 2B -2 ≡3C -3 ≡ D -1 mod7.

So, meaning all these expressions are equal to the same value mod7, say k.

So, N ≡k mod7.

But we can also find N modulo7 in terms of its digits.

N = 1000A +100B +10C +D.

Compute N mod7.

Since 1000 ≡6 mod7, 100≡2 mod7, 10≡3 mod7, 1≡1.

So, N ≡6A +2B +3C +D mod7.

But from the congruences, N ≡k mod7, and k is equal to all four expressions.

But k is equal to 6A -6 mod7, which is same as N. So,

6A +2B +3C +D ≡6A -6 mod7.

Subtract 6A from both sides:

2B +3C +D ≡-6 mod7 →2B +3C +D ≡1 mod7 (since -6 ≡1 mod7).

But from the earlier derived equations:

From 3A - B ≡2 mod7 → B ≡3A -2 mod7.

From 2B -3C ≡6 mod7.

From 3C - D ≡2 mod7 → D ≡3C -2 mod7.

Let me substitute B and D in terms of A and C.

First, B = 3A -2 +7m, where m is an integer (since B must be a digit, m can be 0 or 1, as 3A can be from 3*1=3 to 3*9=27; so 3A-2 can be up to 25, so m can be 0 or 1).

Similarly, D =3C -2 +7n, where n is an integer. Since D is a digit (0-9), 3C -2 must be between -2 and 25, so n can be 0 or 1 or 2, but likely 0 or 1.

So, let's try to express everything in terms of A and C.

So, N mod7 is 6A +2B +3C +D ≡1 mod7.

But substituting B and D:

B =3A -2 +7m → 2B =6A -4 +14m.

D =3C -2 +7n → D =3C -2 +7n.

So, 2B +3C +D = (6A -4 +14m) +3C + (3C -2 +7n) =6A -4 +14m +6C -2 +7n =6A +6C +14m +7n -6.

So, 2B +3C +D =6A +6C +7(2m +n) -6.

So, mod7, this becomes 6A +6C -6 mod7.

So, 2B +3C +D ≡6A +6C -6 mod7.

But earlier, we have 2B +3C +D ≡1 mod7.

So,

6A +6C -6 ≡1 mod7.

Which is,

6A +6C ≡7 mod7 →6A +6C ≡0 mod7.

Divide both sides by 6 (since 6 and7 are coprime; inverse of6 is6 as before):

A + C ≡0 mod7.

So, A + C ≡0 mod7.

So, A + C must be a multiple of7.

Since A and C are digits (A:1-9, C:0-9), their sum can be from1+0=1 to9+9=18. So, the possible sums that are multiples of7 are 7,14.

So, A + C =7 or14.

Since we're looking for the largest N, which is a four-digit number, we should maximize A, then B, then C, then D. So, we want A to be as large as possible, then C as large as possible, etc.

So, A + C =7 or14.

Case1: A + C=14.

Since both A and C are digits, the maximum possible sum is 9+9=18, but 14 is less than that.

So, possible pairs where A + C =14:

A=5, C=9 → sum14

A=6, C=8

A=7, C=7

A=8, C=6

A=9, C=5

So, these are the possible (A,C) pairs for case1.

Case2: A + C=7.

Possible pairs:

A=1, C=6

A=2, C=5

A=3, C=4

A=4, C=3

A=5, C=2

A=6, C=1

A=7, C=0

These are the possible pairs for case2.

Since we want the maximum N, which is ABCD, we need A to be as large as possible. So, in case1, A can be 9,8,7,6,5.

Whereas in case2, the maximum A is7.

So, the maximum A is9, which is in case1.

Therefore, let's first explore case1, A + C=14.

So, possible (A,C):

A=9, C=5

A=8, C=6

A=7, C=7

A=6, C=8

A=5, C=9

We need to find N=ABCD, with A and C as above, and then find B and D based on the earlier equations.

From earlier, we had:

B ≡3A -2 mod7.

Since B is a digit, let's compute B for each A.

Similarly, D ≡3C -2 mod7.

Wait, no, earlier I thought B =3A -2 +7m, but perhaps I should compute B as (3A -2) mod7, and since B is a digit, it's (3A -2) mod7, but B can be that value or that value +7, but since B is a digit, it can only be from 0-9.

So, for each A in case1, let's compute (3A -2) mod7, and see possible B.

Similarly, for D, since D =3C -2 +7n, and D is a digit, n can be 0 or1.

Let me proceed step by step.

First, for A=9, C=5 (since A + C=14).

Compute B: (3*9 -2) mod7.

3*9=27, 27-2=25. 25 mod7: 7*3=21, 25-21=4. So, B≡4 mod7. So B can be 4 or 11, but since B is a digit, B=4.

Compute D: (3*5 -2) mod7.

3*5=15, 15-2=13. 13 mod7=6. So D=6 or 13, but since D is a digit, D=6.

So, for A=9, C=5, B=4, D=6.

So, the number N would be 9 4 5 6 →9456.

But wait, is this N satisfying all the conditions? Let's check.

Wait, but we're trying to find the maximum N, so perhaps N=9456 is a candidate, but let's check if there are larger numbers.

Wait, in case1, A=9, so N would be 9xxx, which is the highest possible four-digit number. So, 9456 is a candidate, but perhaps a larger N exists with A=9, C=5, but higher B and D.

Wait, but in this case, B is determined as 4, because (3A -2) mod7=4, so B can only be 4 or11, but 11 is invalid as a single digit. So, B=4.

Similarly, D is determined as6, because 3C -2 mod7=6, so D=6 or13, but 13 is invalid.

So, N=9456 is the only possible number for A=9, C=5.

But wait, wait, let me check the initial problem statement again.

Wait, the problem says that when any digit is changed to 1, the number is divisible by7. So, for N=9456:

Changing A to1: 1456. Is 1456 divisible by7?

Compute 1456 /7: 7*208=1456. Yes, it's divisible.

Changing B to1: 9156. Check 9156/7: 7*1308=9156. So, yes.

Changing C to1: 9416. 9416 /7: Let's compute. 7*1345=9415, so 9416-9415=1. So, 9416 is 1 mod7. Not divisible. So, N=9456 doesn't satisfy the condition for changing C to1. Therefore, N=9456 is invalid.

Hmm, so that means our initial approach may have a mistake. Because when we derived the congruences, perhaps we made an assumption that may not hold.

Wait, let's go back. So, we considered that N + (1 - A)*1000 ≡0 mod7. Which gave us N ≡6A -6 mod7. But perhaps this is correct.

But when we took N=9456, and changed C to1, we got 9416, which is not divisible by7.

So, perhaps our earlier approach is missing something.

Wait, but according to the congruence, N3=AB1D must be divisible by7.

So, AB1D= 9 4 1 6=9416.

We just saw that 9416 mod7 is 1, so it's not 0. So, this is a problem.

Which suggests that our approach is missing something.

Perhaps the initial step where we set up the congruences is incorrect.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the setup. Let me double-check.

We had N1 =1BCD =1000 + 100B +10C +D.

And N1 ≡0 mod7.

Similarly, N =1000A +100B +10C +D.

So, N1 = N -1000A +1000.

Thus, N1 = N +1000*(1 - A).

So, N1 ≡ N + (1000 mod7)*(1 - A) mod7.

Since 1000 mod7=6, so N1 ≡ N +6*(1 - A) mod7.

But N1 ≡0 mod7, so:

N +6*(1 - A) ≡0 mod7 → N ≡6*(A -1) mod7.

Wait, earlier I think I wrote N ≡6A -6 mod7, which is same as 6*(A -1) mod7. So, correct.

Similarly for the other digits.

But in the case of N=9456, let's compute N mod7.

N=9456.

Compute 9456 mod7:

Well, 7*1350=9450. 9456 -9450=6. So, 9456≡6 mod7.

From the congruence, N ≡6*(A -1) mod7.

A=9, so 6*(9 -1)=6*8=48≡6 mod7 (since 48/7=6*7=42, 48-42=6). So, N≡6 mod7, which matches.

Similarly, check the other congruences.

N ≡2B -2 mod7. B=4. 2*4 -2=8-2=6. So, N≡6 mod7. Correct.

N≡3C -3 mod7. C=5. 3*5 -3=15-3=12≡5 mod7. Wait, 12 mod7 is 5, but N≡6 mod7. So, this is inconsistent.

So, that's the problem. So, according to the congruence, N should ≡3C -3 mod7, but in reality, N≡6 mod7, which doesn't match.

Wait, that suggests that our earlier setup is wrong. Because for N=9456, 3C -3 =12≡5 mod7, but N≡6 mod7, so 5≡6 mod7 is not true.

So, that means that our earlier assumption that all four expressions are equal to the same k is wrong.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the setup. Let me think again.

Wait, the four modified numbers N1, N2, N3, N4 must each be ≡0 mod7.

Which gives four congruences:

1. N + 6*(1 - A) ≡0 mod7 → N ≡6*(A -1) mod7.

2. N + 2*(1 - B) ≡0 mod7 → N ≡2*(B -1) mod7.

3. N +3*(1 - C) ≡0 mod7 → N≡3*(C -1) mod7.

4. N +1*(1 - D) ≡0 mod7 → N≡(D -1) mod7.

So, all four expressions must be equal to N mod7.

So, 6*(A -1) ≡2*(B -1) ≡3*(C -1) ≡(D -1) mod7.

So, all four are equal to N mod7.

So, in the case of N=9456:

6*(9-1)=6*8=48≡6 mod7.

2*(4-1)=6≡6 mod7.

3*(5-1)=12≡5 mod7.

(D-1)=6-1=5≡5 mod7.

Wait, so 6 ≡6 ≡5 ≡5 mod7? No, that's not consistent.

So, 6≡5 mod7 is false. So, that's why N=9456 fails when changing C or D.

So, that suggests that our initial approach is missing something because N=9456 doesn't satisfy all the congruences.

So, perhaps our earlier step where we set all four congruences equal is correct, but in the case of N=9456, the congruences don't hold.

So, perhaps, the way forward is to find a number N where all four expressions 6*(A-1), 2*(B-1), 3*(C-1), and (D-1) are equal mod7.

So, let me denote:

Let’s say that 6*(A -1) ≡2*(B -1) ≡3*(C -1) ≡(D -1) ≡k mod7, where k is some constant.

So, for all four, they must be congruent to the same k mod7.

So, 6*(A -1) ≡k,

2*(B -1) ≡k,

3*(C -1) ≡k,

(D -1) ≡k.

So, solving for each digit:

A = (k/6 +1) mod7,

But 6 inverse is 6, so A = (6k +1) mod7.

Similarly,

B = (k/2 +1) mod7.

Inverse of2 is4, so B=(4k +1) mod7.

C=(k/3 +1) mod7.

Inverse of3 is5, so C=(5k +1) mod7.

D=(k +1) mod7.

So, now, A, B, C, D are determined by k.

But each is a digit (A:1-9, others 0-9). So, let's find possible k (0-6) that makes A,B,C,D valid digits.

We can try each k from0 to6 and see which gives valid digits.

Let's list k=0 to6:

For k=0:

A=(0 +1) mod7=1. So, A=1 or8 (since 1+7=8). But since A is a digit, 1 or8.

B=(0 +1) mod7=1. So, B=1 or8.

C=(0 +1) mod7=1. So, C=1 or8.

D=(0 +1) mod7=1. So, D=1 or8.

But N is a four-digit number, so A can't be0. So, possible Ns would have A=1 or8.

But we're looking for the largest N, so let's see for k=0:

If k=0,

A=1 or8,

B=1 or8,

C=1 or8,

D=1 or8.

So, the largest N would be 8888? Let's check if 8888 meets the condition.

Changing any digit to1:

8888 → changing a digit to1: e.g., 1888, 8188, 8818, 8881.

Check if these are divisible by7.

Compute 1888 /7: 7*269=1883, 1888-1883=5. Not divisible.

So, 1888 mod7=5≠0. So, N=8888 doesn't satisfy the condition. So, k=0 is invalid.

Next, k=1:

A=(6*1 +1)=7 mod7=0. But A can't be0. So invalid.

k=2:

A=(6*2 +1)=13 mod7=6. So, A=6 or13, but since A is a digit, A=6.

B=(4*2 +1)=9 mod7=2. So, B=2 or9.

C=(5*2 +1)=11 mod7=4. So, C=4 or11→4.

D=(2 +1)=3 mod7=3. So, D=3 or10→3.

So, A=6,

B=2 or9,

C=4,

D=3.

So, possible Ns are 6 2 4 3 or 6 9 4 3.

So, N=6243 or6943.

Which is larger? 6943>6243.

So, let's check N=6943.

Check that changing any digit to1 gives a multiple of7.

Changing A to1:1943. 1943 /7=277.571... Not integer. So, 1943 mod7: 7*277=1939, 1943-1939=4. So, 4≠0. So, invalid.

So, k=2 gives invalid N.

k=3:

A=(6*3 +1)=19 mod7=5.

B=(4*3 +1)=13 mod7=6.

C=(5*3 +1)=16 mod7=2.

D=(3 +1)=4 mod7=4.

So, A=5, B=6, C=2, D=4.

So, N=5624.

Check if N=5624 satisfies the condition.

Changing A to1:1624. 1624 /7=232. So, yes.

Changing B to1:5124. 5124 /7=732. So, yes.

Changing C to1:5614. 5614 /7=802. So, yes.

Changing D to1:5621. 5621 /7=803. So, yes.

So, N=5624 is a valid number. But since we're looking for the largest, maybe higher N exists.

k=4:

A=(6*4 +1)=25 mod7=4.

B=(4*4 +1)=17 mod7=3.

C=(5*4 +1)=21 mod7=0.

D=(4 +1)=5 mod7=5.

So, A=4,

B=3,

C=0,

D=5.

N=4305.

Check: changing A to1:1305. 1305 /7=186.428... 1305 mod7=1305-7*186=1305-1302=3. Not divisible.

So, invalid.

k=5:

A=(6*5 +1)=31 mod7=3.

B=(4*5 +1)=21 mod7=0.

C=(5*5 +1)=26 mod7=5.

D=(5 +1)=6 mod7=6.

So, A=3,

B=0,

C=5,

D=6.

N=3056.

Check: changing A to1:1056. 1056/7=150.857... 1056 mod7: 1056 -7*150=1056-1050=6≠0. Invalid.

k=6:

A=(6*6 +1)=37 mod7=2.

B=(4*6 +1)=25 mod7=4.

C=(5*6 +1)=31 mod7=3.

D=(6 +1)=7 mod7=0.

So, A=2,

B=4,

C=3,

D=0.

N=2430.

Check: changing A to1:1430. 1430/7=204.285... 1430 mod7=1430-7*204=1430-1428=2≠0. Invalid.

So, from k=0 to6, only k=2 and k=3 gave possible Ns, but k=2's N=6943 didn't satisfy the condition, and k=3's N=5624 did.

But wait, earlier when k=3, N=5624 is valid. But could there be a higher N?

Wait, but for k=3, A=5, which is lower than possible. Maybe if I consider that A can be 5 +7=12, which is invalid as a digit. So, no. So, A=5 is fixed.

So, N=5624 is a valid number, but perhaps there exists a larger N with a higher A.

Wait, perhaps my initial approach was wrong. Because when we set k=3, we get N=5624, but is there a higher N with a higher A, but still satisfies all four congruences?

Alternatively, perhaps I missed some k values where N is higher.

Wait, when k=3, A=5, but what if A=5 +7=12, which is invalid. So, no.

Wait, but in the earlier case, when k=2, A=6, but N=6943 didn't satisfy the condition. So, perhaps I need to think differently.

Wait, perhaps I should not limit myself to k=0-6, but instead consider that when solving for A, B, C, D, they can be in the range of 0-9, so perhaps even if the modular equations give a value, the actual digit is that value plus some multiple of7.

But I think I did that earlier by considering m and n.

Wait, perhaps N=5624 is the only valid number from this approach. But 5624 is less than9456, which we saw earlier didn't work.

Wait, but perhaps another approach is to find N such that N +1000*(1 - A) ≡0 mod7,

N +100*(1 - B) ≡0 mod7,

N +10*(1 - C) ≡0 mod7,

N +1*(1 - D) ≡0 mod7.

So, all four expressions are ≡0 mod7.

So, N ≡6*(A -1) mod7,

N ≡2*(B -1) mod7,

N ≡3*(C -1) mod7,

N ≡(D -1) mod7.

Thus, all four must equal the same value mod7, which is N mod7.

So, let me denote:

Let’s set N ≡k mod7.

Thus:

k ≡6*(A -1) mod7 → A ≡ (k +6)/6 mod7 → A ≡(k +6)*6 mod7.

Similarly,

k ≡2*(B -1) mod7 → B ≡ (k +2)/2 mod7 → B≡(k +2)*4 mod7.

k≡3*(C -1) mod7 → C≡(k +3)/3 mod7 → C≡(k +3)*5 mod7.

k≡(D -1) mod7 → D≡k +1 mod7.

So, for each k in0-6, compute A, B, C, D as follows:

A = (k +6)*6 mod7,

B=(k +2)*4 mod7,

C=(k +3)*5 mod7,

D=(k +1) mod7.

But A must be a digit from1-9, B,C,D from0-9.

So, for each k, compute A, B, C, D as:

Compute (k +6)*6 mod7 for A,

(k +2)*4 mod7 for B,

(k +3)*5 mod7 for C,

(k +1) mod7 for D.

But since A, B, C, D can be from0-9, but A can't be0, perhaps we can have A = ((k +6)*6 mod7) + 7*m, where m is such that A is a digit.

Similarly for others.

But this might complicate things. Alternatively, perhaps I can iterate k from0 to6, compute A, B, C, D, and then see if they are digits, and then see if the number is valid.

Let me try that.

k=0:

A=(0+6)*6=36 mod7=1.

B=(0+2)*4=8 mod7=1.

C=(0+3)*5=15 mod7=1.

D=(0+1)=1.

So, A=1, B=1, C=1, D=1.

N=1111.

Check: changing any digit to1 gives the same number, which is 1111, which is 1111/7=158.714... Not divisible. So, invalid.

k=1:

A=(1+6)*6=42 mod7=0.

Invalid, since A can't be0.

k=2:

A=(2+6)*6=48 mod7=6.

B=(2+2)*4=16 mod7=2.

C=(2+3)*5=25 mod7=4.

D=(2+1)=3.

So, N=6 2 4 3=6243.

Check:

Changing A to1:1243. 1243 /7=177.571... 1243 mod7=1243-7*177=1243-1239=4≠0. Invalid.

So, N=6243 doesn't work.

k=3:

A=(3+6)*6=54 mod7=5.

B=(3+2)*4=20 mod7=6.

C=(3+3)*5=30 mod7=2.

D=(3+1)=4.

So, N=5 6 2 4=5624.

Check:

Changing A to1:1624. 1624 /7=232. So, yes.

Changing B to1:5124. 5124 /7=732. So, yes.

Changing C to1:5614. 5614 /7=802. So, yes.

Changing D to1:5621. 5621 /7=803. So, yes.

So, N=5624 is valid.

k=4:

A=(4+6)*6=60 mod7=4.

B=(4+2)*4=24 mod7=3.

C=(4+3)*5=35 mod7=0.

D=(4+1)=5.

So, N=4 3 0 5=4305.

Check:

Changing A to1:1305. 1305 /7=186.428... mod7=3≠0. Invalid.

k=5:

A=(5+6)*6=66 mod7=3.

B=(5+2)*4=28 mod7=0.

C=(5+3)*5=40 mod7=5.

D=(5+1)=6.

So, N=3 0 5 6=3056.

Check:

Changing A to1:1056. 1056 /7=150.857... mod7=6≠0. Invalid.

k=6:

A=(6+6)*6=72 mod7=2.

B=(6+2)*4=32 mod7=4.

C=(6+3)*5=45 mod7=3.

D=(6+1)=0.

So, N=2 4 3 0=2430.

Check:

Changing A to1:1430. 1430 /7=204.285... mod7=2≠0. Invalid.

So, only k=3 gives a valid N=5624.

But earlier, when I tried N=9456 with A=9, C=5, it didn't work because the congruences didn't hold. So, perhaps N=5624 is the only number that satisfies all four conditions.

But wait, that seems low. I thought there might be a higher N.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the approach. Because in the earlier approach, when I assumed A + C=14, I found N=9456, but it didn't satisfy all conditions. So, perhaps I need to check if there's a higher N with A=9, but different C.

Wait, but according to the earlier congruences, when A=9, then from A + C ≡0 mod7, with A=9≡2 mod7, so C≡5 mod7. So, C=5 or12, but since C is a digit, C=5.

So, for A=9, C=5.

Then, from B= (3A -2) mod7.

A=9, so 3*9=27≡6 mod7. 6-2=4. So, B≡4 mod7. So, B=4 or11, but B must be a digit, so B=4.

From D= (3C -2) mod7.

C=5, 3*5=15≡1 mod7. 1-2=-1≡6 mod7. So, D=6 or13, but D is a digit, so D=6.

So, N=9456.

But as we saw earlier, changing C to1 gives 9416, which is not divisible by7. So, N=9456 is invalid.

So, perhaps the only valid N is5624.

But that seems low, given that we're looking for the greatest four-digit N.

Wait, perhaps I missed something. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps the mistake is that I considered only k=0 to6, but perhaps the digits can be higher by adding multiples of7, but I didn't account for that in the earlier approach.

Wait, for example, when k=3, we got A=5, B=6, C=2, D=4, giving N=5624.

But perhaps if we add 7 to A, making A=12, which is invalid. So, can't do that.

Alternatively, perhaps I need to find N such that when any digit is changed to1, the number is divisible by7, but without assuming all four congruences are equal.

Wait, perhaps the approach is different.

Wait, another way: For a number to have the property that changing any digit to1 makes it divisible by7, then each modified number must be 0 mod7.

So, let me denote the modified numbers as:

N1 =1BCD,

N2= A1CD,

N3=AB1D,

N4=ABC1.

Each N1, N2, N3, N4 must be divisible by7.

So, let me write each in terms of N.

N1 =1BCD = (N - A*1000) + 1000.

So, N1 = N - A*1000 +1000 = N + (1 - A)*1000.

Similarly,

N2 = A1CD = (N - B*100) + 100 = N + (1 - B)*100.

N3 = AB1D = (N - C*10) +10 = N + (1 - C)*10.

N4 = ABC1 = (N - D) +1 = N + (1 - D).

Each of these must be ≡0 mod7.

So,

N + (1 - A)*1000 ≡0 mod7,

N + (1 - B)*100 ≡0 mod7,

N + (1 - C)*10 ≡0 mod7,

N + (1 - D) ≡0 mod7.

So, each of these must hold.

So, let me compute 1000 mod7=6,

100 mod7=2,

10 mod7=3,

1 mod7=1.

So,

N + (1 - A)*6 ≡0 mod7,

N + (1 - B)*2 ≡0 mod7,

N + (1 - C)*3 ≡0 mod7,

N + (1 - D) ≡0 mod7.

So, these four equations must hold.

So, we can write:

1. N ≡6*(A -1) mod7,

2. N≡2*(B -1) mod7,

3. N≡3*(C -1) mod7,

4. N≡(D -1) mod7.

So, all four must be equal to N mod7.

So, 6*(A -1) ≡2*(B -1) ≡3*(C -1) ≡(D -1) mod7.

So, let me denote this common value as k mod7.

So,

6*(A -1) ≡k,

2*(B -1) ≡k,

3*(C -1) ≡k,

(D -1) ≡k.

So, solving for each digit:

A = (k/6 +1) mod7,

But 6 inverse is6, so A=(6k +1) mod7.

Similarly,

B=(k/2 +1) mod7. 2 inverse is4, so B=(4k +1) mod7.

C=(k/3 +1) mod7. 3 inverse is5, so C=(5k +1) mod7.

D=(k +1) mod7.

So, for each k=0 to6, compute A,B,C,D.

But each must be a valid digit.

Let me make a table:

k | A=(6k +1) mod7 | B=(4k +1) mod7 | C=(5k +1) mod7 | D=(k +1) mod7

0 |1 |1 |1 |1 →N=1111. Check: N1=1111. 1111 mod7=1111-7*158=1111-1106=5≠0. Invalid.

1 | (6+1)=7≡0→ A=0 invalid.

2 | (12+1)=13≡6→A=6 | (8+1)=9≡2→B=2 | (10+1)=11≡4→C=4 | (2+1)=3→D=3. So, N=6243. Check if valid.

But earlier, N=6243 didn't satisfy when changing A to1:1243 mod7=4≠0.

So, invalid.

3 | (18+1)=19≡5→A=5 | (12+1)=13≡6→B=6 | (15+1)=16≡2→C=2 | (3+1)=4→D=4. So, N=5624. Which is valid.

4 | (24+1)=25≡4→A=4 | (16+1)=17≡3→B=3 | (20+1)=21≡0→C=0 | (4+1)=5→D=5. N=4305. Changing A to1:1305 mod7=3≠0. Invalid.

5 | (30+1)=31≡3→A=3 | (20+1)=21≡0→B=0 | (25+1)=26≡5→C=5 | (5+1)=6→D=6. N=3056. Changing A to1:1056 mod7=6≠0. Invalid.

6 | (36+1)=37≡2→A=2 | (24+1)=25≡4→B=4 | (30+1)=31≡3→C=3 | (6+1)=0→D=0. N=2430. Changing A to1:1430 mod7=2≠0. Invalid.

So, only N=5624 is valid.

Wait, but that seems low. I was expecting a higher number. Did I miss any possibilities?

Wait, perhaps the digits can be higher than the mod7 values. For example, when k=3, A=5, but could A be 5 +7=12, which is invalid. So, no.

Similarly, for other digits, they can't exceed single digits.

So, perhaps N=5624 is the only four-digit number that satisfies the conditions.

But I'm not sure. Let me think differently.

Another approach: Let's assume that N is the largest possible, say 9999, and check if it satisfies the condition. If not, decrement and check.

But that would take a lot of time, but maybe I can find a pattern.

Alternatively, perhaps the number N must be such that N ≡k mod7, and each modified number is 0 mod7.

So, let me consider that N must be ≡ - (1 - A)*1000 mod7,

Which is N ≡6*(A -1) mod7.

Similarly, N≡2*(B -1) mod7,

N≡3*(C -1) mod7,

N≡(D -1) mod7.

So, all four must be equal to N mod7.

Thus, 6*(A -1) ≡2*(B -1) mod7,

6*(A -1) ≡3*(C -1) mod7,

6*(A -1) ≡(D -1) mod7.

Let me solve these congruences.

First, 6*(A -1) ≡2*(B -1) mod7.

Divide both sides by2: 3*(A -1) ≡(B -1) mod7.

So, 3A -3 ≡ B -1 mod7 →3A - B ≡2 mod7.

Similarly, 6*(A -1) ≡3*(C -1) mod7.

Divide both sides by3: 2*(A -1) ≡(C -1) mod7.

So, 2A -2 ≡C -1 mod7 →2A - C ≡1 mod7.

Third, 6*(A -1) ≡(D -1) mod7.

So, 6A -6 ≡D -1 mod7 →6A - D ≡5 mod7.

So, now we have three equations:

1. 3A - B ≡2 mod7,

2. 2A - C ≡1 mod7,

3. 6A - D ≡5 mod7.

And we also have N =1000A +100B +10C +D.

Our goal is to find the largest N, so we'll try A=9 and see if possible.

A=9.

From equation1: 3*9 -B ≡2 mod7 →27 -B ≡2 →27 mod7=6, so 6 - B ≡2 →-B ≡-4 →B≡4 mod7.

So, B=4 or11. But B is a digit, so B=4.

From equation2: 2*9 - C ≡1 mod7 →18 -C ≡1 →18 mod7=4, so 4 -C ≡1 →-C≡-3 →C≡3 mod7.

So, C=3 or10. But C is a digit, so C=3.

From equation3: 6*9 - D ≡5 mod7 →54 -D ≡5 →54 mod7=5, so 5 -D ≡5 →-D≡0 →D≡0 mod7.

So, D=0 or7.

So, D=0 or7.

So, possible Ns when A=9:

B=4, C=3, D=0 or7.

So, N=9430 or9437.

Now, check if these Ns satisfy the condition.

First, N=9430.

Check each modified number:

1. Changing A to1:1430. 1430 /7=204.285... →1430 mod7=2≠0. So, invalid.

Similarly, N=9437.

Changing A to1:1437. 1437 /7=205.285... →1437 mod7=1437-7*205=1437-1435=2≠0. Invalid.

So, A=9 doesn't give a valid N.

Next, try A=8.

From equation1:3*8 -B ≡2 →24 -B ≡2 mod7.

24 mod7=3, so 3 -B ≡2 →-B≡-1 →B≡1 mod7.

So, B=1 or8.

From equation2:2*8 -C ≡1 →16 -C ≡1 mod7.

16 mod7=2, so 2 -C≡1 →-C≡-1 →C≡1 mod7.

So, C=1 or8.

From equation3:6*8 -D ≡5 →48 -D ≡5 mod7.

48 mod7=6, so 6 -D≡5 →-D≡-1 →D≡1 mod7.

So, D=1 or8.

So, possible Ns when A=8:

B can be1 or8,

C can be1 or8,

D can be1 or8.

We need to choose the largest possible N, so let's choose the largest digits.

So, B=8, C=8, D=8.

So, N=8888.

Check if it satisfies the condition.

Changing A to1:1888. 1888 /7=269.714... 1888 mod7=1888-7*269=1888-1883=5≠0. Invalid.

So, N=8888 invalid.

Next, try B=8, C=8, D=1: N=8881.

Check:

Changing A to1:1881. 1881 /7=268.714... 1881 mod7=1881-7*268=1881-1876=5≠0. Invalid.

Similarly, other combinations will likely fail.

Alternatively, perhaps a lower N within A=8.

But since A=8 is the second highest, perhaps N=8888 is the highest, but it's invalid.

So, moving on.

A=7.

From equation1:3*7 - B ≡2 →21 - B ≡2 mod7.

21 mod7=0, so 0 - B ≡2 →-B≡2→B≡5 mod7.

So, B=5 or12→5.

From equation2:2*7 -C ≡1 →14 -C ≡1 mod7.

14 mod7=0, so 0 -C≡1 →-C≡1→C≡6 mod7.

So, C=6 or13→6.

From equation3:6*7 -D ≡5 →42 -D ≡5 mod7.

42 mod7=0, so 0 - D≡5 →-D≡5→D≡2 mod7.

So, D=2 or9.

So, possible Ns when A=7:

B=5,

C=6,

D=2 or9.

So, N=7562 or7569.

Check N=7569.

Changing A to1:1569. 1569 /7=224.142... 1569 mod7=1569-7*224=1569-1568=1≠0. Invalid.

N=7562.

Changing A to1:1562. 1562 /7=223.142... 1562 mod7=1562-7*223=1562-1561=1≠0. Invalid.

So, A=7 doesn't give a valid N.

Proceeding to A=6.

From equation1:3*6 - B ≡2 →18 - B ≡2 mod7.

18 mod7=4, so 4 - B ≡2 →-B≡-2→B≡2 mod7.

So, B=2 or9.

From equation2:2*6 - C ≡1 →12 - C ≡1 mod7.

12 mod7=5, so 5 - C ≡1 →-C≡-4→C≡4 mod7.

So, C=4 or11→4.

From equation3:6*6 - D ≡5 →36 - D ≡5 mod7.

36 mod7=1, so 1 - D≡5 →-D≡4→D≡3 mod7.

So, D=3 or10→3.

So, possible Ns when A=6:

B=2 or9,

C=4,

D=3.

To get the largest N, choose B=9.

So, N=6943.

Check if it satisfies the condition.

Changing A to1:1943. 1943 /7=277.571... 1943 mod7=1943-7*277=1943-1939=4≠0. Invalid.

So, N=6943 invalid.

Next, B=2, so N=6243.

Check:

Changing A to1:1243. 1243 mod7=1243-7*177=1243-1239=4≠0. Invalid.

So, A=6 doesn't give a valid N.

Proceeding to A=5.

From equation1:3*5 - B ≡2 →15 - B ≡2 mod7.

15 mod7=1, so 1 - B≡2 →-B≡1→B≡6 mod7.

So, B=6 or13→6.

From equation2:2*5 - C ≡1 →10 - C ≡1 mod7.

10 mod7=3, so 3 - C≡1 →-C≡-2→C≡2 mod7.

So, C=2 or9.

From equation3:6*5 - D ≡5 →30 - D ≡5 mod7.

30 mod7=2, so 2 - D≡5 →-D≡3→D≡4 mod7.

So, D=4 or11→4.

So, possible Ns when A=5:

B=6,

C=2 or9,

D=4.

To get the largest N, choose C=9.

So, N=5 6 9 4=5694.

Check:

Changing A to1:1694. 1694 /7=242. So, yes.

Changing B to1:5194. 5194 /7=742. So, yes.

Changing C to1:5614. 5614 /7=802. So, yes.

Changing D to1:5691. 5691 /7=813. So, yes.

So, N=5694 is valid.

Wait, this is higher than previous N=5624.

Wait, but earlier when I tried k=3, I got N=5624, but this approach with A=5, B=6, C=9, D=4 gives N=5694, which is higher and valid.

So, that suggests that my earlier approach was incomplete because I didn't consider that when solving for C, it could be 2 or9, not just 2.

So, N=5694 is a valid number and higher than5624.

So, perhaps this is the answer.

Wait, but let's check if there's a higher N with A=5, C=9.

But since we're at A=5, perhaps higher Ns exist with higher A.

Wait, but I just found N=5694, which is higher than5624.

So, perhaps I should continue checking higher A.

Wait, but A=5 is lower than A=9,8,7,6, which didn't give valid Ns.

So, N=5694 is a valid number, but perhaps there's a higher N.

Wait, let me check A=5, B=6, C=9, D=4.

N=5694.

Check each modified number:

1. Changing A to1:1694. 1694 /7=242. So, yes.

2. Changing B to1:5194. 5194 /7=742. So, yes.

3. Changing C to1:5614. 5614 /7=802. So, yes.

4. Changing D to1:5691. 5691 /7=813. So, yes.

So, N=5694 is valid.

Is there a higher N with A=5?

Well, if C can be9, and D=4, then N=5694.

If I can find a higher N with A=5, but higher digits in B, C, D.

But B is fixed at6, as per equation1.

C can be9.

D can be4.

So, N=5694 is the highest possible with A=5.

But wait, what about A=5, B=6, C=9, D=4.

Is there a higher N with A=5 and higher digits?

No, because B is fixed at6, C=9, D=4.

So, N=5694 is the highest for A=5.

Now, let's check if there's a higher N with A=4.

From equation1:3*4 - B ≡2 →12 - B ≡2 mod7.

12 mod7=5, so 5 - B≡2 →-B≡-3→B≡3 mod7.

So, B=3 or10→3.

From equation2:2*4 - C ≡1 →8 - C ≡1 mod7.

8 mod7=1, so 1 - C≡1 →-C≡0→C≡0 mod7.

So, C=0 or7.

From equation3:6*4 - D ≡5 →24 - D ≡5 mod7.

24 mod7=3, so 3 - D≡5 →-D≡2→D≡5 mod7.

So, D=5 or12→5.

So, possible Ns when A=4:

B=3,

C=0 or7,

D=5.

So, N=4 3 0 5=4305 or4375.

Check N=4375.

Changing A to1:1375. 1375 /7=196.428... mod7=1375-7*196=1375-1372=3≠0. Invalid.

N=4305.

Changing A to1:1305. mod7=3≠0. Invalid.

So, A=4 doesn't give a valid N.

Proceeding to A=3.

From equation1:3*3 - B ≡2 →9 - B ≡2 mod7.

9 mod7=2, so 2 - B≡2 →-B≡0→B≡0 mod7.

So, B=0 or7.

From equation2:2*3 - C ≡1 →6 - C ≡1 mod7.

6 mod7=6, so 6 - C≡1 →-C≡-5→C≡5 mod7.

So, C=5 or12→5.

From equation3:6*3 - D ≡5 →18 - D ≡5 mod7.

18 mod7=4, so 4 - D≡5 →-D≡1→D≡6 mod7.

So, D=6 or13→6.

So, possible Ns when A=3:

B=0 or7,

C=5,

D=6.

To get the highest N, choose B=7.

So, N=3 7 5 6=3756.

Check:

Changing A to1:1756. 1756 /7=250.857... mod7=1756-7*250=1756-1750=6≠0. Invalid.

So, N=3756 invalid.

Alternatively, B=0: N=3056.

Check:

Changing A to1:1056. 1056 mod7=6≠0. Invalid.

So, A=3 doesn't give a valid N.

Proceeding to A=2.

From equation1:3*2 - B ≡2 →6 - B ≡2 mod7.

6 mod7=6, so 6 - B≡2 →-B≡-4→B≡4 mod7.

So, B=4 or11→4.

From equation2:2*2 - C ≡1 →4 - C ≡1 mod7.

4 mod7=4, so 4 - C≡1 →-C≡-3→C≡3 mod7.

So, C=3 or10→3.

From equation3:6*2 - D ≡5 →12 - D ≡5 mod7.

12 mod7=5, so 5 - D≡5 →-D≡0→D≡0 mod7.

So, D=0 or7.

So, possible Ns when A=2:

B=4,

C=3,

D=0 or7.

So, N=2430 or2437.

Check N=2437.

Changing A to1:1437. mod7=2≠0. Invalid.

N=2430.

Changing A to1:1430. mod7=2≠0. Invalid.

So, A=2 doesn't give a valid N.

Finally, A=1.

From equation1:3*1 - B ≡2 →3 - B ≡2 mod7.

So, -B≡-1→B≡1 mod7.

So, B=1 or8.

From equation2:2*1 - C ≡1 →2 - C ≡1 mod7.

So, -C≡-1→C≡1 mod7.

So, C=1 or8.

From equation3:6*1 - D ≡5 →6 - D ≡5 mod7.

So, -D≡-1→D≡1 mod7.

So, D=1 or8.

So, possible Ns when A=1:

B=1 or8,

C=1 or8,

D=1 or8.

To get the highest N, choose B=8, C=8, D=8.

So, N=1888.

Check:

Changing A to1: same number, which is1888. 1888 mod7=5≠0. Invalid.

So, N=1888 invalid.

Thus, from all possible A=1 to9, the only valid Ns are5624 and5694.

Earlier, I thought N=5624 was the only one, but with A=5, B=6, C=9, D=4, I found N=5694, which is higher.

So, perhaps N=5694 is the answer.

Wait, but let me check if there's a higher N with A=5.

Wait, when A=5, B=6, C=9, D=4, N=5694.

Is there a higher N with A=5, B=6, C=9, D=11→invalid.

No, D must be4.

So, N=5694 is the highest for A=5.

Now, to confirm, let's check if N=5694 satisfies all the conditions.

Changing A to1:1694. 1694 /7=242. So, yes.

Changing B to1:5194. 5194 /7=742. So, yes.

Changing C to1:5614. 5614 /7=802. So, yes.

Changing D to1:5691. 5691 /7=813. So, yes.

All four modified numbers are divisible by7. So, N=5694 is valid.

Is there a higher N than5694 with the same property?

Let me check N=5695.

Wait, but I need to find the maximum N, so perhaps N=5694 is the highest.

But wait, maybe there's a higher N with A=5, B=6, C=9, D=4.

Alternatively, perhaps I can find a higher N with A=5, B=6, C=9, D=11→invalid.

So, no.

Thus, N=5694 is the highest four-digit number with the desired property.

Now, the problem asks for Q + R, where Q is the quotient and R is the remainder when N is divided by1000.

So, N=5694.

Dividing by1000: 5694 ÷1000=5 quotient, remainder 694.

So, Q=5, R=694.

Thus, Q + R=5 +694=699.

Wait, but wait, let me compute it again.

5694 divided by1000 is5 with a remainder of694.

So, yes, Q=5, R=694.

Thus, Q + R=5 +694=699.

But wait, earlier I thought N=5624 was the answer, but upon further exploration, found N=5694, which is higher and valid.

So, the answer should be699.

To solve the problem, we need to find the greatest four-digit number \( N \) such that changing any one of its digits to 1 results in a number divisible by 7. We then find \( Q + R \), where \( Q \) is the quotient and \( R \) is the remainder when \( N \) is divided by 1000.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Understanding the Problem**:
   - \( N \) is a four-digit number, denoted as \( ABCD \) where \( A, B, C, D \) are its digits.
   - Changing any digit to 1 must result in a number divisible by 7.

2. **Setting Up Congruences**:
   - For each digit position, when changed to 1, the resulting number must be congruent to 0 modulo 7.
   - This leads to four congruences involving \( N \) and its digits.

3. **Deriving Relationships**:
   - By analyzing the congruences, we establish relationships between the digits and \( N \) modulo 7.
   - These relationships help us express each digit in terms of a common variable \( k \) modulo 7.

4. **Finding Valid Digits**:
   - For each possible value of \( k \) (0 to 6), compute the corresponding digits \( A, B, C, D \) ensuring they are valid digits (0-9 for \( B, C, D \) and 1-9 for \( A \)).

5. **Checking Validity**:
   - For each candidate number \( N \), verify that changing each digit to 1 results in a number divisible by 7.

6. **Identifying the Largest \( N \)**:
   - Through systematic checking, we find that \( N = 5694 \) is the largest valid number meeting all conditions.

7. **Calculating \( Q + R \)**:
   - Divide \( N = 5694 \) by 1000 to get \( Q = 5 \) and \( R = 694 \).
   - Summing these gives \( Q + R = 5 + 694 = 699 \).

### Final Answer:
The value of \( Q + R \) is **699**.

\boxed{699}
