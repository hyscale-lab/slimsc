Okay, so I need to figure out how many paths of length 16 on an 8x8 grid change direction exactly four times. Hmm, let's break this down step by step.

First, the grid is 8x8, which means it's a square grid with 8 rows and 8 columns. The path goes from the lower left corner to the upper right corner. Each move in the grid can either be up or to the right. Since we're going from the lower left to the upper right, we'll need to move right 8 times and up 8 times. So, the path has 16 steps in total.

Wait, the problem mentions paths of length 16. That makes sense because each step is either right or up, and there are 8 of each, totaling 16 steps.

Now, the key part is that the path changes direction exactly four times. Hmm, direction changes. So, what does that mean? Each time the path switches from moving right to up or from up to right, that's a direction change. So, if a path goes right, right, up, up, right, right, up, up, etc., each switch counts as a direction change.

Wait, how does that relate to the number of direction changes? Let me think. If a path has k direction changes, how does that translate into the number of segments of right and up moves?

Suppose the path starts by moving right. Then, each time it changes direction, it switches to up, then back to right, and so on. So, each direction change adds a new segment. If there are four direction changes, that would mean five segments. Because the number of segments is one more than the number of direction changes. For example, starting with right, then up, then right, then up, then right: that's four direction changes and five segments.

Wait, let me check. One direction change gives two segments. So, yes, n direction changes give n+1 segments.

So, if the path has four direction changes, it'll have five segments. Each segment is a consecutive run of either right or up moves.

Now, the path starts with either right or up. But since we're going from lower left to upper right, the first move has to be either right or up. But wait, actually, no. Wait, the grid is 8x8, so to move from (0,0) to (8,8), you need 8 right and 8 up moves.

But the starting direction could be either right or up. So, the path can start with right or up, and then each direction change alternates the direction.

So, if the path changes direction four times, the number of segments is five. Each segment is either a run of right moves or a run of up moves.

Now, the total number of right moves is 8, and the total number of up moves is 8.

So, the five segments consist of some right and up runs. Let's say the path starts with right. Then the segments alternate between right and up. So, if it starts with right, the segments would be right, up, right, up, right. That's three right segments and two up segments. Alternatively, if it starts with up, it would be up, right, up, right, up: three up segments and two right segments.

But the total number of right segments must be either 3 or 2, depending on starting direction. Wait, let's see. If the number of direction changes is four, then the starting direction determines the number of segments of each type.

Wait, if you start with right and have four direction changes, the number of right segments is (number of direction changes + 1)/2 if the number of direction changes is odd? Wait, no, let me think again.

If the number of direction changes is four, which is even, then starting with right, the number of right segments would be (4/2) +1= three, and up segments would be two. Starting with up, it would be three up segments and two right segments.

Wait, that makes sense. Because each direction change flips the direction, so after four direction changes, you end up on the same direction as you started. So, if you start with right, after four changes, you end with right again. So, the pattern is right, up, right, up, right. So, three right segments and two up segments.

Similarly, if you start with up, the segments would be up, right, up, right, up: three up segments and two right segments.

Therefore, the number of right segments is either three or two, and similarly for up segments.

Wait, but the total right moves are 8, so if we have three right segments, each of which contributes some number of right moves, and two up segments contributing some number of up moves.

So, the problem now is to find the number of ways to distribute the 8 right moves into either three or two segments (depending on starting direction) and the 8 up moves into two or three segments respectively.

Wait, so for each starting direction, we can compute the number of possible distributions.

But perhaps it's better to consider both starting directions separately and then add the two cases together.

Wait, but can the starting direction affect the number of direction changes? I think not, because regardless of starting direction, four direction changes would result in five segments.

So, perhaps the total number of paths is equal to the number of paths starting with right with four direction changes plus the number starting with up with four direction changes.

Alternatively, maybe it's symmetric, so we can compute one and double it. Let's check.

If we start with right, we have three right segments and two up segments. Each right segment must have at least one right move, and same for each up segment.

Similarly, if we start with up, we have three up segments and two right segments, each with at least one up or right move.

So, the number of ways to distribute the right moves when starting with right is the number of ways to partition 8 right moves into three segments, each at least 1. Similarly for up moves.

Similarly, for starting with up, the number of ways to partition 8 up moves into three segments, each at least 1, and 8 right moves into two segments, each at least 1.

Wait, so let's model this.

Case 1: Starting with right.

Number of direction changes: 4.

Segments: R, U, R, U, R. So, three R segments and two U segments.

Each R segment must have at least 1 step, and each U segment must have at least 1 step.

So, the number of ways to distribute the 8 R steps into 3 segments: this is a stars and bars problem. The number of ways is C(8-1,3-1) = C(7,2).

Similarly, for the U steps: 8 U steps into 2 segments: C(8-1,2-1)=C(7,1).

Similarly, Case 2: Starting with up.

Segments: U, R, U, R, U. Three U segments and two R segments.

Number of ways to distribute 8 U steps into 3 segments: C(7,2).

Number of ways to distribute 8 R steps into 2 segments: C(7,1).

So, for each case, the number of paths is C(7,2)*C(7,1).

Since there are two cases (starting with R or starting with U), the total number is 2 * C(7,2)*C(7,1).

Wait, but is that correct? Let me make sure.

Wait, each case (starting with R or U) leads to the same number of possibilities because of the symmetry between R and U in the grid. Therefore, the total number would be 2 multiplied by (number of ways when starting with R).

So, let's compute C(7,2) and C(7,1).

C(7,2) is 21, and C(7,1) is 7.

So, for each starting direction, the number is 21 * 7 = 147.

Then, total number of paths is 2 * 147 = 294.

Wait, but let me double-check.

Wait, for starting with R:

Number of ways to distribute R steps: C(7,2)=21.

Number of ways to distribute U steps: C(7,1)=7.

Multiply them: 21*7=147.

Similarly, starting with U: same calculation, 147.

Total: 147*2=294.

So, the answer is 294.

Wait, but wait a second. Let me think again about the direction changes.

Each time the path changes direction, it's a new segment. So, in starting with R, four direction changes would give segments R, U, R, U, R. So five segments, three R and two U.

Similarly, starting with U, four direction changes give U, R, U, R, U: five segments, three U and two R.

But in each case, the number of R and U segments is determined by the starting direction.

So, the initial approach seems correct.

Alternatively, perhaps another way to model this is to think about the number of runs of R and U.

In the grid path, a run is a consecutive sequence of R or U moves.

Each time the direction changes, a new run begins.

So, for four direction changes, there are five runs.

If the first run is R, then the number of R runs is three and U runs is two.

If the first run is U, then the number of U runs is three and R runs is two.

So, the number of paths is equal to the number of such compositions.

So, for each starting direction, the number is C(7,2)*C(7,1), leading to 2*(21*7)=294.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps I should think of it as the number of ways to arrange the runs.

But perhaps I should model this as the number of compositions.

Wait, the number of compositions of 8 into 3 parts for R, each part at least 1, is C(8-1,3-1)=C(7,2)=21.

Similarly, for U into 2 parts: C(7,1)=7.

So, yes, that's correct.

Similarly, when starting with U, it's C(7,2) for U into 3 parts and C(7,1) for R into 2 parts.

So, 2*(21*7)=294.

But wait, I think I remember that in some problems, the number of paths with exactly k direction changes is 2 * C(n-1, k/2) * C(m-1, k/2), but in this case, n and m are both 8, and k is four.

Wait, perhaps not exactly. Let me think.

Wait, another approach: the number of paths with exactly t direction changes is equal to 2 * C(7, t/2) * C(7, t/2) when t is even.

Wait, in this case, t=4, which is even. So, each direction change is a switch, so the number of runs of each direction is (t/2 +1). Hmm, not exactly.

Wait, perhaps it's better to model it as the number of compositions.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula for the number of paths from (0,0) to (m,n) with exactly k direction changes is given by something like 2 * C(m-1, a) * C(n-1, b), where a and b depend on the number of runs.

Wait, but maybe I'm overcomplicating.

Wait, another way: the number of paths with exactly four direction changes is equal to the number of lattice paths with exactly five runs.

Each run is a consecutive sequence of right or up moves.

So, for each starting direction, the number of runs of that direction is (number of runs)/2 +1.

Wait, no. If you have five runs, and the starting direction is R, then you have three R runs and two U runs.

Similarly, starting with U, three U runs and two R runs.

So, for starting with R: number of ways to partition R steps into three runs (each at least 1) multiplied by the number of ways to partition U steps into two runs (each at least 1).

Similarly for starting with U.

So, the number of such paths is 2 * [C(7,2) * C(7,1)].

Which is 2*(21*7)=294.

So, I think that's the answer.

Wait, let me check with a smaller grid to see if this approach works.

Suppose we have a 2x2 grid, and we want paths that change direction exactly two times.

So, from (0,0) to (2,2), with exactly two direction changes.

So, how many such paths?

Each path would have three runs.

If starting with R: R, U, R.

Each R run must have at least 1, so distributing 2 R into two runs: possible distributions are (1,1). So, only one way.

Similarly, distributing U: 2 U into two runs: only (1,1), one way.

So, starting with R: 1*1=1 path.

Similarly, starting with U: U, R, U. Distributing U into two runs: (1,1). Distributing R into two runs: (1,1). So, 1*1=1 path.

Total paths: 2.

But let's enumerate all such paths.

From (0,0) to (2,2), with exactly two direction changes.

Each such path has three segments. For starting with R:

R, then U, then R.

So, first move R, then U, then R.

So, in terms of steps: R, U, R, U, R.

Wait, no, that's three direction changes.

Wait, wait, no.

Wait, in a 2x2 grid, to have two direction changes, the path must have three segments.

Wait, for example:

R, R, U, U: that's one direction change (after two R's, then U's). So, that's one direction change.

Wait, but in a 2x2 grid, a path that goes R, U, R, U would have three direction changes, which is more than two.

Wait, I'm getting confused.

Wait, perhaps my approach is incorrect.

Wait, in a 2x2 grid, the minimal number of direction changes is one, which is when you go all R's first, then all U's, or all U's first then all R's.

Wait, but to have two direction changes, the path must switch direction twice.

So, for example:

R, U, R, U: that's three direction changes, right? Because it starts with R, then switches to U (1), then back to R (2), then back to U (3). So that's three direction changes.

Wait, but in a 2x2 grid, the total steps are four: two R and two U.

Wait, so how can you have two direction changes?

Let me think. Maybe R, R, U, U: that's one direction change, after the second R.

Alternatively, R, U, R, U: that's three direction changes.

Wait, but is there a way to have exactly two direction changes?

Wait, perhaps not, because to go from (0,0) to (2,2), you need to move two R and two U steps.

If you start with R, then U, then R: that's two direction changes. Because R, then switch to U (1), then switch back to R (2). Then, you have to go U again, but that would be a third direction change.

Wait, no, if you have R, U, R, U: that's three direction changes.

Wait, perhaps in a 2x2 grid, the number of direction changes can only be 1 or 3. Hmm.

Wait, that suggests that my initial approach for the 8x8 grid may be incorrect because in the 2x2 grid, the number of direction changes must be odd.

Wait, because each direction change flips the direction, so starting with R, after an even number of direction changes, you end with R, after an odd number, you end with U.

But in a square grid, m=n=8, so to reach the end, if you start with R and have an even number of direction changes, you end with R, but you have to have made exactly 8 R steps and 8 U steps. So, if you end with R, the last step is R, so the previous step must be U. Hence, the number of direction changes must be odd.

Wait, wait, that's a key point.

In an 8x8 grid, starting with R, after an even number of direction changes, you end with R. But to have made 8 R steps, the last segment must be R, which would require that the previous segment was U.

But in that case, you have 8 R steps and 8 U steps.

Wait, perhaps in an 8x8 grid, the number of direction changes must be odd.

Wait, let's think: starting with R, each direction change flips the direction. So, after even number of changes, you end with R; after odd, you end with U.

But since the total number of R and U steps are the same (8 each), the number of direction changes must be odd. Because if you end with R, the total number of R steps is one more than U steps. Wait, no, because each R segment is followed by a U segment, except possibly the last.

Wait, no, suppose you have starting with R: R, U, R, U, R.

That's three R segments and two U segments.

Total R steps: sum of R segments =8, total U steps: sum of U segments=8.

So, in this case, the number of R segments is one more than U segments.

Similarly, if starting with U, you have three U segments and two R segments.

So, to have equal numbers of R and U steps, the number of segments for each direction must differ by one.

So, the number of direction changes is (number of segments -1). So, if the number of R segments is 3, the number of U segments is 2, total segments is 5, direction changes is 4.

But in that case, the total R steps sum to 8, and U steps sum to 8.

So, in the 8x8 grid, it's possible to have four direction changes, which is even.

Wait, but in the 2x2 grid, trying to have two direction changes would require three segments: for example, R, U, R.

But that would require two R segments and one U segment. So, R steps would be sum of two segments, U steps sum of one segment.

In a 2x2 grid, that would mean R steps: 2, so each R segment must sum to 2, but you have two R segments. So, each R segment would have to be 1 and 1.

Wait, but 1+1=2, okay.

Similarly, U steps: 2, but only one U segment, so 2.

So, the path would be R, U, R.

Which corresponds to R, U, R, U. Wait, no, that's four steps, but that's three direction changes.

Wait, maybe I'm getting confused again.

Alternatively, perhaps my initial approach is correct and the 2x2 grid is a special case where it's not possible to have an even number of direction changes.

Wait, perhaps in an n x n grid, the number of direction changes must be odd if n is even, or something like that.

Hmm, perhaps this calls for a more general formula.

Wait, perhaps the number of paths with exactly k direction changes is zero when k is even and n is even, but that can't be, because in the 8x8 grid, we're getting 294 paths with 4 direction changes.

Wait, so maybe my initial reasoning was correct despite the 2x2 grid confusion.

Alternatively, perhaps the 2x2 grid isn't the best test case.

Wait, maybe let's consider a 1x1 grid. From (0,0) to (1,1). The number of paths with exactly 0 direction changes: you have to go R then U, or U then R, so two paths, each with one direction change.

Wait, no, in a 1x1 grid, the minimal path is two steps, R then U, or U then R. Each path has one direction change.

So, trying to have zero direction changes in a 1x1 grid is impossible, because you have to switch direction once.

Wait, so in a 1x1 grid, the number of direction changes is always one.

Hmm, perhaps for an n x n grid, the minimum number of direction changes is one, and the maximum is 2n -1.

Wait, but for 8x8, we have 8 R and 8 U steps.

The maximum number of direction changes would be 15: alternating R, U, R, U,... ending with R or U.

Wait, but in that case, the number of segments would be 16, but you can't have more than 16 segments because each segment is at least one step.

Wait, but no, since you have 8 R and 8 U steps, the maximum number of direction changes is 15: each step alternates direction, but that would require 16 segments, but you only have 16 steps.

Wait, but 16 segments would require that each segment is a single step, so R, U, R, U,... 16 times.

But in this case, you'd have 8 R and 8 U steps, which is possible.

But that's 15 direction changes.

So, for 8x8 grid, direction changes can range from 1 to 15.

Wait, but in our problem, it's four direction changes.

So, perhaps the initial approach is correct, and the answer is 294.

Therefore, the number of such paths is 294.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To solve the problem, we consider paths on an 8x8 grid from the lower left to the upper right corner, consisting of 16 steps (8 right and 8 up). The task is to find the number of such paths that change direction exactly four times.

### Key Steps:

1. **Understanding Direction Changes**:  
   A direction change occurs when the path switches from moving right (R) to up (U) or vice versa. With four direction changes, the path has five segments. If the path starts with R, the segments alternate as R, U, R, U, R (three R segments and two U segments). Similarly, if it starts with U, the segments are U, R, U, R, U (three U segments and two R segments).

2. **Partitioning Steps into Segments**:  
   For each starting direction, the steps must be distributed into the respective segments.  
   - Starting with R:  
     - 8 R steps into 3 segments: \( \binom{7}{2} = 21 \) ways.  
     - 8 U steps into 2 segments: \( \binom{7}{1} = 7 \) ways.  
     - Total paths starting with R: \( 21 \times 7 = 147 \).  
   - Starting with U:  
     - 8 U steps into 3 segments: \( \binom{7}{2} = 21 \) ways.  
     - 8 R steps into 2 segments: \( \binom{7}{1} = 7 \) ways.  
     - Total paths starting with U: \( 21 \times 7 = 147 \).  

3. **Total Paths**:  
   Since the problem is symmetric for starting directions R and U, the total number of paths is the sum of both cases:  
   \[
   147 + 147 = 294.
   \]

### Final Answer:
\boxed{294}
