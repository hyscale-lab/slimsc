Okay, so Alice and Bob are playing this game with a stack of n tokens. Alice goes first, and on each turn, a player can remove either 1 or 4 tokens. The person who takes the last token wins. I need to find how many positive integers n ≤ 2024 where Bob can guarantee a win, no matter how Alice plays.

Hmm, let's think about this. It's a turn-based game, so I can model this using game theory concepts, probably something with winning and losing positions. A winning position is one where the current player can force a win, and a losing position is where no matter what the current player does, the opponent can force a win.

Since Alice goes first, if the starting position is a losing position, Bob can win. So I need to find all n where the first player is in a losing position, which would mean Bob can win.

Let me try to find a pattern or some recurrence relation for these positions. Let's denote a position as either a winning (W) or losing (L) position.

Base cases:
- n=0: If there are no tokens, the game is over. But since the player who takes the last token wins, I think n=0 is a losing position because the player can't make a move. So n=0 → L.
- n=1: The player can take 1 token and win. So n=1 → W.
- n=2: The player can take 1 token, leaving 1 for the opponent, who can then take it and win. Wait, no, if n=2, if I take 1, opponent takes 1 and wins. If I take 4, I can't because there are only 2. So no, wait, I have to take 1 or 4. So from n=2, the only move is to take 1, leaving 1. Then the opponent can take that 1 and win. So n=2 is a losing position? Wait, no. Wait, no, because if I'm at n=2, I take 1, leaving 1 for the opponent. Then opponent takes 1, wins. So n=2 is a losing position for the player whose turn it is. So n=2 → L.

Wait, that can't be right. Because if the player is at n=2, they can take 1, leaving 1, which is a winning position for the opponent. Or, can they take 4? No, because n=2, so they can't take 4. So yes, from n=2, the player can only move to n=1, which is a W for the opponent. So n=2 is L.

Wait, but I'm getting confused. Let's try to list the positions step by step.

Let me make a table from n=0 up to, say, n=10, and determine each as W or L.

n=0: L (no move, so losing)
n=1: W (take 1 and win)
n=2: ?
n=3: ?
n=4: W (take 4 and win)
n=5: ?
n=6: ?
n=7: ?
n=8: ?
n=9: ?
n=10: ?

Let me start filling this out.

n=0: L

n=1: You can take 1, so W.

n=2: You can only take 1, leaving n=1 for the opponent, which is W for them. So, if all moves from n=2 lead to opponent's W, then n=2 is L.

n=3: You can take 1, leaving n=2 (which is L for opponent). So if you leave opponent at L, then n=3 is W.

n=4: You can take 4 and win. So W.

n=5: Let's see. From n=5, you can take 1, leaving n=4 (which is W for opponent), or take 4, leaving n=1 (which is W for opponent). So all moves from n=5 lead to opponent's W. Therefore, n=5 is L.

n=6: From n=6, take 1, leaving n=5 (which is L for opponent). So n=6 is W.

n=7: From n=7, take 1, leaving n=6 (W for opponent). Or take 4, leaving n=3 (W for opponent). So all moves leave opponent at W. So n=7 is L.

n=8: From n=8, take 1, leaving n=7 (L for opponent). So n=8 is W.

n=9: From n=9, take 1, leaving n=8 (W for opponent). Take 4, leaving n=5 (L for opponent). So if you take 4, opponent is left with L. So n=9 is W.

n=10: From n=10, take 1, leaving n=9 (W). Take 4, leaving n=6 (W). So both moves leave opponent at W, so n=10 is L.

Wait, let's list all:

n : 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10

Result: L W L W W L W L W W L

Wait, that's a pattern. Let me write it out:

n | Result
0 | L
1 | W
2 | L
3 | W
4 | W
5 | L
6 | W
7 | L
8 | W
9 | W
10| L

Hmm, looking for a pattern. Let's list the losing positions: n=0,2,5,7,10,...

Looking at these numbers: 0,2,5,7,10,...

The differences between them:

2-0=2

5-2=3

7-5=2

10-7=3

So it alternates between adding 2 and adding 3.

So the sequence is 0, then +2=2, then +3=5, +2=7, +3=10, +2=12, +3=15, etc.

So the losing positions are at n=0,2,5,7,10,12,15,17,20,22,25,27,... and so on.

So the losing positions are numbers that are either 0 mod 5? Wait, 0,2,5,7,10,12,15,17,20,22,... Let me see if there's a pattern in terms of modulo.

Looking at 0,2,5,7,10,12,15,17,20,...

Wait, maybe it's numbers that are congruent to 0 or 2 mod 5? Let's check:

n=0: 0 mod5=0 → yes
n=2: 2 mod5=2 → yes
n=5: 0 mod5=0 → yes
n=7: 2 mod5=2 → yes
n=10:0 → yes
n=12: 12 mod5=2 → yes
n=15:0 → yes
n=17:2 → yes
n=20:0 → yes
n=22:2 → yes
And so on.

So the losing positions are numbers where n ≡ 0 or 2 mod5.

Wait, let me check n=3:

n=3: 3 mod5=3 → not 0 or 2 → n=3 is a winning position. Correct.

n=4:4 mod5=4 → W. Correct.

n=5:0 mod5=0 → L. Correct.

n=6:1 mod5=1 → W. Correct.

n=7:2 mod5=2 → L. Correct.

n=8:3 mod5=3 → W. Correct.

n=9:4 mod5=4 → W. Correct.

n=10:0 mod5=0 → L. Correct.

Yes, seems like the losing positions are n where n ≡0 or 2 mod5.

So if n ≡0 or 2 mod5, the current player is in a losing position if both players play optimally.

But wait, in the game, Alice goes first. So for Bob to have a winning strategy, n must be a losing position for Alice, meaning n is a losing position. Therefore, n must be ≡0 or 2 mod5.

Wait, but let me make sure. Because the starting player is Alice. So if n is a losing position, then Alice is in a losing position, meaning Bob can win.

So we need to count all n ≤2024 where n ≡0 or 2 mod5.

So now, how many such numbers are there?

Each complete block of 5 numbers contains two losing positions: 0 and 2 mod5.

So for numbers from 1 to 2024, how many numbers are ≡0 or 2 mod5.

Wait, but n starts from 1, not 0. So let's adjust for that.

Wait, n=0 is not considered since we're only counting positive integers up to 2024. So the first losing position is n=2, then 5,7,10,... etc.

Wait, let me think again.

Wait, n=0 is a losing position, but it's not a positive integer. So for n≥1, the losing positions are n≡2 mod5 and n≡0 mod5, but n must be ≥1.

Wait, n=5 is 0 mod5, which is a losing position. So the positions are n=2,5,7,10,12,15,17,... up to 2024.

So essentially, the losing positions for n ≥1 are when n ≡0 mod5 or n ≡2 mod5. So numbers divisible by 5 or 2 more than a multiple of 5.

So now, to count how many such numbers are ≤2024.

First, find how many numbers ≤2024 are ≡0 mod5.

The largest multiple of 5 ≤2024 is floor(2024/5)=404*5=2020.

So numbers: 5,10,15,...,2020. The count is 2020/5 = 404 numbers.

Next, numbers ≡2 mod5.

These are 2,7,12,17,..., up to the largest number ≤2024.

What's 2024 divided by5? 2024 ÷5=404.8.

So the largest number ≡2 mod5 ≤2024 is 5*404 +2=2020+2=2022.

So the sequence is 2,7,12,...,2022.

How many terms are there?

The first term a=2, last term l=2022, common difference d=5.

Number of terms = ((l - a)/d) +1 = ((2022-2)/5)+1 = (2020/5)+1=404+1=405.

So total numbers that are ≡0 mod5: 404

Total numbers ≡2 mod5:405

Total losing positions:404+405=809.

Wait, but let me check for n=2024. 2024 mod5 is 2024-5*404=2024-2020=4→2024≡4 mod5. So the last term for ≡2 mod5 is 2022.

So 405 terms for ≡2 mod5.

So total losing positions from n=1 to n=2024:404 (for 0 mod5) +405 (for 2 mod5)=809.

Wait, but wait, n=0 is not included because we're only considering positive integers. So n=5 is the first ≡0 mod5.

But n=2 is the first ≡2 mod5.

So yes, the count is correct.

Wait, but let me double-check the counts.

For the ≡0 mod5 numbers starting at 5, ending at 2020:

Number of terms is (2020 -5)/5 +1 = (2015)/5 +1=403 +1=404.

Yes, that's correct.

For the ≡2 mod5 numbers starting at 2, ending at 2022:

Number of terms is ((2022-2)/5)+1=(2020/5)+1=404+1=405.

Yes, correct.

So total losing positions: 404 + 405 = 809.

So the number of positive integers n ≤2024 where Bob can guarantee a win is 809.

Wait, but I should make sure that the initial analysis of the losing positions is correct.

Looking back, let me re-examine the initial steps.

n=0: L

n=1: W

n=2: L

n=3: W

n=4: W

n=5: L

n=6: W

n=7: L

n=8: W

n=9: W

n=10: L

n=11: W

n=12: L

n=13: W

n=14: W

n=15: L

Yes, the losing positions are indeed at n=0,2,5,7,10,12,15,17,... which are numbers ≡0 or 2 mod5.

So the count is 809.

Wait, but wait a second. Let me check n=7. From n=7, you can take 1, leaving n=6 (W). Or take4, leaving n=3 (W). So yes, both options leave the opponent in a winning position, so n=7 is L. Correct.

Similarly, n=10: take1→n=9 (W), take4→n=6 (W). So yes, n=10 is L.

So the pattern holds.

Thus, the number of such n is 809.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The game involves Alice and Bob taking turns removing 1 or 4 tokens from a stack of n tokens, with Alice starting first. A player wins by taking the last token. We need to determine how many positive integers n ≤ 2024 allow Bob to guarantee a win, regardless of Alice's moves.

By analyzing the game, we identify winning (W) and losing (L) positions. A losing position is one where the current player cannot force a win, regardless of the opponent's moves. Through examination, we find that the losing positions occur when n ≡ 0 or 2 mod 5.

To count the number of such n ≤ 2024:

1. **Numbers ≡ 0 mod 5**: These are multiples of 5 (5, 10, 15, ..., 2020). There are 404 such numbers.
2. **Numbers ≡ 2 mod 5**: These are numbers like 2, 7, 12, ..., 2022. There are 405 such numbers.

Adding these, there are 404 + 405 = 809 losing positions where Bob can guarantee a win.

**Answer**: The number of positive integers n ≤ 2024 where Bob can guarantee a win is \boxed{809}.
