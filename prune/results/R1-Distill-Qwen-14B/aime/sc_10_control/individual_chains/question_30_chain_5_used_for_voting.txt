Okay, so I have this problem here: Let ω ≠ 1 be a 13th root of unity. I need to find the remainder when the product from k=0 to 12 of (2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k}) is divided by 1000. Hmm, that seems a bit intimidating at first glance, but maybe I can break it down.

First, let's recall what a 13th root of unity is. A 13th root of unity is a complex number ω such that ω^13 = 1. Since ω ≠ 1, it's one of the primitive roots. These roots satisfy the equation x^13 - 1 = 0, and they can be written as ω^k for k = 0, 1, 2, ..., 12. But since ω ≠ 1, we're considering k from 1 to 12.

The product given is from k=0 to 12, so that includes all the roots. Wait, but when k=0, ω^0 = 1, so that term is (2 - 2*1 + 1^0), but maybe I should compute that separately. Let me compute that first.

When k=0: 2 - 2*1 + 1 = 2 - 2 + 1 = 1. So the first term is 1. So the entire product is 1 multiplied by the product from k=1 to 12 of (2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k}).

So now, I can focus on calculating the product from k=1 to 12 of (2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k}).

Hmm, maybe I can factor this expression or find a pattern. Let me see if I can rewrite 2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k} in a different way.

Looking at the expression: 2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k}. Let me try to see if it can be written as a polynomial in ω^k. Let's denote x = ω^k. Then the expression becomes 2 - 2x + x^2.

So, 2 - 2x + x^2. Let me rearrange it: x^2 - 2x + 2.

Hmm, that's a quadratic in x. Maybe I can factor it or find its roots. Let me check the discriminant: b² - 4ac = (−2)^2 − 4*1*2 = 4 - 8 = -4. So the roots are complex and given by [2 ± sqrt(-4)]/2 = [2 ± 2i]/2 = 1 ± i.

So, x^2 - 2x + 2 factors as (x - (1 + i))(x - (1 - i)). So, 2 - 2x + x^2 = (x - (1 + i))(x - (1 - i)).

But wait, in our case, x = ω^k, so the term becomes (ω^k - (1 + i))(ω^k - (1 - i)).

So, the product from k=1 to 12 of (2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k}) is equal to the product from k=1 to 12 of (ω^k - (1 + i))(ω^k - (1 - i)).

That is, the product is [product from k=1 to 12 of (ω^k - (1 + i))] multiplied by [product from k=1 to 12 of (ω^k - (1 - i))].

So, now, I have two products, each over k=1 to 12, of (ω^k - a) where a is (1 + i) and (1 - i) respectively.

Wait a second, I remember that for cyclotomic polynomials, the product over all primitive roots can be related to certain polynomials. Let me think.

The product over k=1 to 12 of (x - ω^k) is equal to the cyclotomic polynomial Φ_13(x), because the 13th roots of unity except 1 are all primitive. Since 13 is prime, Φ_13(x) = x^12 + x^11 + ... + x + 1. But wait, actually, Φ_13(x) is the minimal polynomial for primitive 13th roots, so it's equal to (x^13 - 1)/(x - 1) = x^12 + x^11 + ... + x + 1.

But in our case, the product is over (ω^k - a), which is similar to evaluating Φ_13(a) if a ≠ 1, but let me check.

Wait, Φ_n(a) is the product of (a - ω^k) for each primitive nth root of unity ω^k. Wait, but in our case, n=13 is prime, so all ω^k for k=1 to 12 are primitive. So, Φ_13(a) is the product from k=1 to 12 of (a - ω^k). That's exactly the product we're considering.

So, product from k=1 to 12 of (a - ω^k) = Φ_13(a). But in our case, we have (ω^k - a), which is (-1)(a - ω^k). So, the product becomes (-1)^12 * product from k=1 to 12 of (a - ω^k). Since (-1)^12 = 1, it's equal to Φ_13(a).

Therefore, the product from k=1 to 12 of (ω^k - a) = Φ_13(a).

So, going back, our original product is Φ_13(1 + i) * Φ_13(1 - i).

So, since Φ_13(x) = x^12 + x^11 + ... + x + 1, then Φ_13(a) = a^12 + a^11 + ... + a + 1.

So, we need to compute Φ_13(1 + i) and Φ_13(1 - i), then multiply them together, and then take the entire product (which is 1 * that result) and find its remainder modulo 1000.

So, let me first compute Φ_13(1 + i). Let me denote a = 1 + i, b = 1 - i. Then, Φ_13(a) = a^12 + a^11 + ... + a + 1, same for Φ_13(b).

But computing a^12 + ... + 1 directly seems difficult, perhaps there's a smarter way.

Wait, another approach: because Φ_n(a) = (a^n - 1)/(a - 1), when a is not a root of unity. Wait, actually, Φ_n(a) is equal to the product over primitive nth roots ω of (a - ω), but also equal to (a^{φ(n)} - 1)/something? Hmm, maybe not directly. Alternatively, maybe we can use the fact that Φ_13(x) is the 13th cyclotomic polynomial, which is equal to (x^{13} - 1)/(x - 1).

Wait, but that's correct. So Φ_13(x) = (x^13 - 1)/(x - 1) = x^12 + x^11 + ... + x + 1.

So, if I plug in a = 1 + i, then Φ_13(a) = (a^13 - 1)/(a - 1). Similarly for b = 1 - i.

So, let me compute a^13 where a = 1 + i.

Wait, but 1 + i is a complex number. Let me find its polar form. 1 + i has magnitude sqrt(2), angle π/4. So, (1 + i) = sqrt(2) e^{iπ/4}.

Therefore, a^13 = (sqrt(2))^13 * e^{i *13 * π/4}.

Compute (sqrt(2))^13: sqrt(2) is 2^{1/2}, so (2^{1/2})^13 = 2^{13/2} = 2^6 * 2^{1/2} = 64 * sqrt(2).

Now, e^{i *13 * π/4}: 13π/4 is equivalent to (3π/4) because 13 divided by 4 is 3 with a remainder of 1, so 13π/4 = 3π + π/4 = π/4 (since e^{iθ} is periodic with period 2π, so subtract 2π three times: 13π/4 - 2π*3 = 13π/4 - 6π = 13π/4 - 24π/4 = -11π/4, which is the same as adding 2π to get it within 0 to 2π: -11π/4 + 2π = -11π/4 + 8π/4 = π/4. So, e^{i *13π/4} = e^{iπ/4} = (sqrt(2)/2 + i sqrt(2)/2).

Thus, a^13 = 64*sqrt(2) * (sqrt(2)/2 + i sqrt(2)/2) = 64*sqrt(2)*(sqrt(2)/2)(1 + i) = 64*(2)/2*(1 + i) = 64*(1 + i).

Wait, let's verify that step:

sqrt(2) * sqrt(2)/2 = (2)/2 = 1. So, 64*sqrt(2) * (sqrt(2)/2 + i sqrt(2)/2) = 64*(1 + i). Yes, that's correct.

So, a^13 = 64(1 + i). Then, a^13 - 1 = 64(1 + i) - 1 = 64 + 64i - 1 = 63 + 64i.

Then, Φ_13(a) = (a^13 - 1)/(a - 1) = (63 + 64i)/( (1 + i) - 1 ) = (63 + 64i)/(i).

Dividing by i is the same as multiplying by -i, so:

(63 + 64i)/i = (63 + 64i)*(-i) = -63i -64i^2 = -63i +64 (since i^2 = -1).

So, Φ_13(1 + i) = 64 -63i.

Similarly, let's compute Φ_13(1 - i).

Let me denote b = 1 - i.

Again, b = 1 - i, which is sqrt(2) e^{-iπ/4}.

So, b^13 = (sqrt(2))^13 e^{-i *13π/4}.

Similarly, (sqrt(2))^13 is 64*sqrt(2) as before.

e^{-i *13π/4} = e^{-i (3π + π/4)} = e^{-i π/4} (since subtracting 13π/4 is equivalent to subtracting 3π + π/4, which is the same as e^{-i π/4} because e^{-i3π} = e^{-i\pi} = -1, but let me check:

Wait, 13π/4 is 3π + π/4. So, e^{-i *13π/4} = e^{-i (3π + π/4)} = e^{-iπ/4} * e^{-i3π}.

But e^{-i3π} = e^{-iπ} = -1 (since e^{-i2π} = 1, so e^{-i3π} = e^{-iπ} which is -1 + 0i).

So, e^{-i13π/4} = e^{-iπ/4} * (-1) = - e^{-iπ/4} = -(sqrt(2)/2 - i sqrt(2)/2).

So, b^13 = 64*sqrt(2) * (-sqrt(2)/2 + i sqrt(2)/2) = 64*sqrt(2)*(-sqrt(2)/2 + i sqrt(2)/2) = 64*( - (2)/2 + i (2)/2 ) = 64*(-1 + i).

Wait, let's compute that step:

sqrt(2) * (-sqrt(2)/2) = - (2)/2 = -1.

Similarly, sqrt(2) * (i sqrt(2)/2 ) = i (2)/2 = i.

So, b^13 = 64*(-1 + i) = -64 + 64i.

Then, b^13 - 1 = (-64 + 64i) - 1 = -65 +64i.

Φ_13(b) = (b^13 - 1)/(b - 1) = (-65 +64i)/( (1 - i) - 1 ) = (-65 +64i)/(-i).

Dividing by -i is the same as multiplying by i, so:

(-65 +64i)/(-i) = (-65 +64i)*i = (-65i +64i^2) = (-65i -64) because i^2 = -1.

So, Φ_13(1 - i) = -64 -65i.

Wait, let me check that calculation again because I might have made a mistake.

Wait, (-65 +64i)/(-i) = (-65 +64i) * (1/i) = multiply numerator and denominator by i: [(-65 +64i) * i ] / ( -i^2 ) = [ (-65i +64i^2) ] / ( -(-1) ) = [ (-65i -64) ] / 1 = -64 -65i.

Yes, that's correct.

So now, Φ_13(1 + i) = 64 -63i, Φ_13(1 - i) = -64 -65i.

So, the product Φ_13(1 + i) * Φ_13(1 - i) = (64 -63i)*(-64 -65i).

Let me compute this product:

(64 -63i)*(-64 -65i) = 64*(-64) + 64*(-65i) -63i*(-64) -63i*(-65i).

Compute each term:

64*(-64) = -4096

64*(-65i) = -4160i

-63i*(-64) = +4032i

-63i*(-65i) = +4095i^2 = +4095*(-1) = -4095.

So, adding all terms together:

-4096 -4160i +4032i -4095.

Combine like terms:

Real parts: -4096 -4095 = -8191.

Imaginary parts: (-4160i +4032i) = (-128i).

So, the product is -8191 -128i.

Wait, that's a complex number. But our original product is a real number because it's the product of terms each of which is a complex number, but since the product is symmetric, the imaginary parts should cancel out. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake somewhere.

Wait, let me check the calculation again.

Wait, when I multiplied (64 -63i)*(-64 -65i), let me compute it using the distributive property:

= 64*(-64) + 64*(-65i) + (-63i)*(-64) + (-63i)*(-65i)

= (-4096) + (-4160i) + (4032i) + (4095i^2)

Since i^2 = -1, 4095i^2 = -4095.

So, summing up:

-4096 -4095 = -8191

-4160i +4032i = (-128i)

So, total is -8191 -128i. Hmm, that's correct.

Wait, but the original product is the product of terms each of which is a complex number, but the product should be real because all the complex roots come in conjugate pairs, so their product should be real. But in this case, it's giving a complex number, which suggests I made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier when evaluating Φ_13(1 + i) and Φ_13(1 - i). Let me double-check that.

Earlier, I computed Φ_13(a) = (a^13 - 1)/(a - 1) for a = 1 + i.

We found a^13 = 64(1 + i), so a^13 - 1 = 63 + 64i.

Then, (63 + 64i)/(a - 1) = (63 + 64i)/(i) = (63 + 64i) * (-i) = -63i -64i^2 = -63i +64.

Which is 64 -63i. That seems correct.

Similarly, for b = 1 - i, we found b^13 = (-64 +64i), so b^13 -1 = -65 +64i.

Then, ( -65 +64i )/(b - 1) = ( -65 +64i )/( -i ) = multiply numerator and denominator by i: ( (-65 +64i)i ) / ( -i^2 ) = ( -65i +64i^2 ) / 1 = -65i -64, which is -64 -65i. That's correct.

So, the product is (64 -63i)*(-64 -65i) = -8191 -128i. Hmm.

Wait, but that can't be right because the product should be real. So, perhaps I made a mistake in interpreting the product. Let me think again.

Wait, our original product is from k=1 to 12 of (2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k}) = product of (ω^k - (1 + i))(ω^k - (1 - i)) = Φ_13(1 + i) * Φ_13(1 - i). So, according to this, it's (64 -63i)*(-64 -65i) = -8191 -128i.

But that's a problem because the product of real numbers should be real. So, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of Φ_13(1 + i) or Φ_13(1 - i).

Wait, let me recompute Φ_13(1 + i):

Compute a = 1 + i.

Compute a^13:

(1 + i)^13. Alternatively, maybe compute it using binomial coefficients, but that's tedious. Alternatively, note that (1 + i)^2 = 2i, so (1 + i)^4 = (2i)^2 = -4, (1 + i)^8 = (-4)^2 = 16, (1 + i)^12 = (16)*( (1 + i)^4 )^3 = 16*(-4)^3 = 16*(-64) = -1024.

Wait, wait, that's a better approach.

Wait, (1 + i)^2 = 2i.

(1 + i)^4 = (2i)^2 = -4.

(1 + i)^8 = (-4)^2 = 16.

(1 + i)^12 = (1 + i)^8 * (1 + i)^4 = 16 * (-4) = -64.

Then, (1 + i)^13 = (1 + i)^12 * (1 + i) = (-64)(1 + i) = -64 -64i.

Wait, earlier I calculated a^13 as 64(1 + i), which is incorrect. So, that was the mistake.

Let me correct that.

Compute a = 1 + i.

Compute a^2 = (1 + i)^2 = 1 + 2i + i^2 = 1 + 2i -1 = 2i.

a^4 = (a^2)^2 = (2i)^2 = -4.

a^8 = (a^4)^2 = (-4)^2 = 16.

a^12 = a^8 * a^4 = 16 * (-4) = -64.

a^13 = a^12 * a = (-64)(1 + i) = -64 -64i.

So, a^13 = -64 -64i.

Thus, a^13 - 1 = (-64 -64i) -1 = -65 -64i.

Then, Φ_13(a) = (a^13 -1)/(a - 1) = (-65 -64i)/( (1 + i) - 1 ) = (-65 -64i)/(i).

Dividing by i is same as multiplying by -i:

(-65 -64i)/i = (-65 -64i) * (-i) = 65i +64i^2 = 65i -64.

So, Φ_13(1 + i) = -64 +65i.

Similarly, compute Φ_13(1 - i). Let b = 1 - i.

Compute b^2 = (1 - i)^2 = 1 - 2i + i^2 = 1 - 2i -1 = -2i.

b^4 = (b^2)^2 = (-2i)^2 = (-2)^2 * i^2 = 4*(-1) = -4.

b^8 = (b^4)^2 = (-4)^2 = 16.

b^12 = b^8 * b^4 = 16 * (-4) = -64.

b^13 = b^12 * b = (-64)(1 - i) = -64 +64i.

b^13 -1 = (-64 +64i) - 1 = -65 +64i.

Φ_13(b) = (b^13 -1 )/(b -1 ) = (-65 +64i)/( (1 - i) - 1 ) = (-65 +64i)/(-i).

Dividing by -i is same as multiplying by i:

(-65 +64i)/(-i) = (-65 +64i)*i = (-65i +64i^2) = (-65i -64).

Thus, Φ_13(1 - i) = -64 -65i.

So now, Φ_13(1 + i) = -64 +65i, Φ_13(1 - i) = -64 -65i.

Now, the product is (-64 +65i)*(-64 -65i). Let's compute this:

(-64 +65i)*(-64 -65i) = (-64)^2 + (65i)^2 + (-64)(-65i) +65i*(-64).

Wait, no, better to use (a + b)(a - b) = a^2 - b^2, where a = -64, b = 65i.

So, (-64)^2 - (65i)^2 = 4096 - (4225 i^2) = 4096 - (4225*(-1)) = 4096 + 4225 = 8321.

Wait, that's much better. So, the product is 8321.

Wait, let me compute it step by step:

(-64 +65i)*(-64 -65i) = (-64)(-64) + (-64)(-65i) +65i*(-64) +65i*(-65i)

= 4096 + 4160i -4160i -4225i^2.

Simplify:

4096 + (4160i -4160i) + (-4225*(-1)).

= 4096 + 0 + 4225 = 8321.

Yes, that's correct. So, the product Φ_13(1 + i)*Φ_13(1 - i) = 8321.

But wait, earlier I thought the product was (64 -63i)*(-64 -65i) which gave a complex number, but that was due to an error in calculating a^13. Now, after correcting that, the product is 8321, which is real, as expected.

So, the original product is 1 * 8321 = 8321.

Wait, but the original product was from k=0 to12, which is 1 (from k=0) multiplied by the product from k=1 to12, which we found to be 8321. So, the total is 8321.

Now, the problem asks for the remainder when this product is divided by 1000.

So, compute 8321 mod 1000.

Well, 8321 divided by 1000 is 8 with a remainder of 321. Because 8*1000=8000, and 8321 -8000=321.

Thus, the remainder is 321.

Wait, so the final answer is 321.

But let me double-check everything once more to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.

1. We started with the product from k=0 to12 of (2 -2ω^k + ω^{2k}).

2. For k=0, term is 1.

3. For k=1 to12, each term is (2 - 2ω^k + ω^{2k}) = (ω^k - (1 +i))(ω^k - (1 -i)).

4. So, the product is Φ_13(1 +i) * Φ_13(1 -i).

5. Calculated Φ_13(1 +i) = -64 +65i, Φ_13(1 -i) = -64 -65i.

6. Their product is (-64 +65i)(-64 -65i) = 4096 + 4225 = 8321.

7. So, total product is 1*8321=8321.

8. 8321 mod1000 is 321.

Yes, that seems correct. So, the answer is 321.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To solve the problem, we start by noting that ω is a primitive 13th root of unity, satisfying ω^13 = 1. The given product is:

\[
\prod_{k=0}^{12}(2 - 2\omega^k + \omega^{2k})
\]

For k=0, the term is (2 - 2*1 + 1) = 1. Thus, the product simplifies to:

\[
1 \times \prod_{k=1}^{12} (2 - 2\omega^k + \omega^{2k})
\]

We rewrite each term \(2 - 2\omega^k + \omega^{2k}\) as \((\omega^k - (1 + i))(\omega^k - (1 - i))\). Therefore, the product becomes:

\[
\prod_{k=1}^{12} (\omega^k - (1 + i)) \times \prod_{k=1}^{12} (\omega^k - (1 - i))
\]

Using the properties of cyclotomic polynomials, we recognize that:

\[
\prod_{k=1}^{12} (\omega^k - a) = \Phi_{13}(a)
\]

where \(\Phi_{13}(x)\) is the 13th cyclotomic polynomial, given by \(\Phi_{13}(x) = x^{12} + x^{11} + \dots + x + 1\). Thus, the product becomes:

\[
\Phi_{13}(1 + i) \times \Phi_{13}(1 - i)
\]

To compute \(\Phi_{13}(1 + i)\) and \(\Phi_{13}(1 - i)\), we use the fact that \(\Phi_{13}(x) = \frac{x^{13} - 1}{x - 1}\) for \(x \neq 1\). Calculating:

\[
(1 + i)^{13} = -64 - 64i \quad \text{and} \quad (1 - i)^{13} = -64 + 64i
\]

Thus:

\[
\Phi_{13}(1 + i) = \frac{(1 + i)^{13} - 1}{(1 + i) - 1} = -64 + 65i
\]
\[
\Phi_{13}(1 - i) = \frac{(1 - i)^{13} - 1}{(1 - i) - 1} = -64 - 65i
\]

Multiplying these results:

\[
(-64 + 65i)(-64 - 65i) = (-64)^2 - (65i)^2 = 4096 + 4225 = 8321
\]

The total product is \(1 \times 8321 = 8321\). Finally, computing \(8321 \mod 1000\):

\[
8321 \div 1000 = 8 \quad \text{with a remainder of} \quad 321
\]

Thus, the remainder when the product is divided by 1000 is:

\[
\boxed{321}
\]
