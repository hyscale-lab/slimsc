Okay, so I have this math problem here, and I need to find the product xy where both x and y are real numbers greater than 1. The problem says that log base x of y^x equals 10, and log base y of x^(4y) also equals 10. Hmm, that's a bit to unpack. Let me try to take it step by step.

First, let's write down the given equations using logarithms. I remember that log_b(a) = c means that b^c = a. So, applying that to the first equation: log_x(y^x) = 10. That should mean that x^10 = y^x. Wait, because the base is x and the result is 10, so x^10 = y^x.

Similarly, the second equation is log_y(x^{4y}) = 10. So, that would mean y^10 = x^{4y}. Okay, so now I have two equations:

1. x^10 = y^x
2. y^10 = x^{4y}

Hmm, I need to find xy. Maybe I can express both equations in terms of x and y and then find a relationship between them.

Let me take the first equation: x^10 = y^x. I can take the natural logarithm of both sides to make it easier to handle exponents. So, ln(x^10) = ln(y^x). That simplifies to 10 ln x = x ln y. So, 10 ln x = x ln y. Let me note that as equation (1): 10 ln x = x ln y.

Similarly, for the second equation: y^10 = x^{4y}. Taking natural logarithm again, ln(y^10) = ln(x^{4y}). Which gives 10 ln y = 4y ln x. Let me note that as equation (2): 10 ln y = 4y ln x.

Now, I have two equations:

1. 10 ln x = x ln y
2. 10 ln y = 4y ln x

Hmm, perhaps I can express ln y from equation (1) and substitute into equation (2). Let's try that.

From equation (1):

ln y = (10 ln x) / x.

So, ln y is equal to (10 ln x) divided by x.

Now, substitute ln y into equation (2):

10 * [ (10 ln x) / x ] = 4y ln x.

Simplify the left side: 10*(10 ln x /x) = (100 ln x)/x.

So, (100 ln x)/x = 4y ln x.

Hmm, assuming ln x is not zero, which it can't be because x > 1, so ln x > 0. So, I can divide both sides by ln x:

100 / x = 4y.

So, 100 / x = 4y => y = (100)/(4x) => y = 25/x.

So, now I have y expressed in terms of x: y = 25/x. That's useful.

Now, let's plug this back into one of the earlier equations. Maybe equation (1) would be good. Let's recall equation (1):

10 ln x = x ln y.

But y is 25/x, so ln y = ln(25/x) = ln25 - ln x.

So, plugging back into equation (1):

10 ln x = x (ln25 - ln x).

Let me write that out:

10 ln x = x ln25 - x ln x.

Bring all terms to one side:

10 ln x + x ln x - x ln25 = 0.

Factor out ln x from the first two terms:

ln x (10 + x) - x ln25 = 0.

Hmm, so ln x (10 + x) = x ln25.

Hmm, let's write this as:

ln x = [x ln25] / (10 + x).

Alternatively, ln x = [x ln25] / (x + 10).

Wait, maybe I can write this as:

ln x = (ln25) * x / (x + 10).

Hmm, that's an equation where x is both in the numerator and denominator, which is a bit tricky. Maybe I can make a substitution to simplify it.

Let me set t = x, so I'm trying to solve for t in:

ln t = (ln25) * t / (t + 10).

Hmm, perhaps I can rearrange terms to make it exponential. Let's see:

Multiply both sides by (t + 10):

(t + 10) ln t = t ln25.

Hmm, maybe bring all terms to one side:

(t + 10) ln t - t ln25 = 0.

Hmm, this looks like a transcendental equation, which might not have a straightforward algebraic solution. Maybe I can try to find a clever substitution or perhaps find t such that both sides balance.

Alternatively, maybe I can express ln25 in terms of ln5. Since 25 is 5 squared, ln25 = 2 ln5. Let me note that.

So, equation becomes:

(t + 10) ln t = t * 2 ln5.

So:

(t + 10) ln t = 2 t ln5.

Hmm, maybe I can write this as:

(t + 10) ln t = 2 t ln5.

I wonder if there's a value of t that makes both sides equal. Let me think about possible integer values for t. Let's test t = 5.

Left side: (5 + 10) ln5 = 15 ln5. Right side: 2*5 ln5 = 10 ln5. 15 ln5 is not equal to 10 ln5. So, t=5 is not a solution.

What about t=10?

Left side: (10 +10) ln10 = 20 ln10 ≈ 20 * 2.302585 ≈ 46.0517.

Right side: 2*10 ln5 ≈ 20 * 1.609438 ≈ 32.18876. Not equal.

Hmm, what about t=25?

Left side: (25 +10) ln25 = 35 * ln25 ≈35 * 3.218876 ≈ 112.66066.

Right side: 2*25 ln5 = 50 * 1.609438 ≈80.4719. Still not equal.

Hmm, maybe t= something else. Alternatively, perhaps t= something like 10 or 5. Maybe t= something else.

Wait, maybe t=5 is part of it? Alternatively, perhaps I can take both sides as exponents. Let me think.

Alternatively, perhaps I can write this equation in terms of exponents.

Wait, let me rearrange the equation:

(t +10) ln t = 2 t ln5.

Divide both sides by t:

(1 + 10/t) ln t = 2 ln5.

Hmm, that might not be helpful. Alternatively, maybe I can express this as:

ln t / (2 ln5) = t / (t +10).

Hmm, maybe that's a better approach. Let me write it as:

(ln t) / (ln25) = t / (t +10).

Wait, because 2 ln5 is ln25. So, yes, that's correct.

So, (ln t) / (ln25) = t / (t +10).

Hmm, so (ln t) / (ln25) is log base25 of t, right? Because log_b a = ln a / ln b.

Yes, so I can write this as log_25 t = t / (t +10).

Hmm, so now I have log_25 t = t / (t +10). Hmm, that's an interesting equation. Maybe I can find t such that log_25 t = t / (t +10).

I wonder if t=25 is a solution. Let's test t=25.

Left side: log_25(25) = 1.

Right side: 25/(25 +10) =25/35=5/7≈0.714. So, 1≠0.714. Not equal.

What about t=5?

Left side: log_25(5)= 1/2 because 25^(1/2)=5.

Right side:5/(5+10)=5/15=1/3≈0.333. So, 0.5 ≠0.333.

Hmm, what about t=10?

Left side: log_25(10)= ln10 / ln25 ≈2.302585/3.218876≈0.715.

Right side:10/(10+10)=0.5. So, 0.715≈0.5? No.

Hmm, perhaps t=16?

Wait, 16 is 2^4. Let's try t=16.

Left side: log_25(16)= ln16/ln25≈2.772589/3.218876≈0.861.

Right side:16/(16+10)=16/26≈0.615. Not equal.

Hmm, what about t= something else, maybe t= something where log_25 t = t/(t+10). Maybe t= something like 25/2=12.5.

Let me try t=12.5.

Left side: log_25(12.5)= ln12.5 / ln25≈2.53102/3.218876≈0.786.

Right side:12.5/(12.5+10)=12.5/22.5≈0.555. Hmm, 0.786≠0.555.

Hmm, perhaps t is not an integer, so I might need to solve this equation numerically or find another approach.

Wait, perhaps I can let u = t. Then, the equation is log_25 u = u/(u +10). Hmm, not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps I can let u = t +10. Hmm, but not sure if that helps.

Wait, maybe it's better to go back to the original equations and see if there's another way to approach this.

We have two equations:

1. x^10 = y^x
2. y^10 = x^{4y}

And from that, we found that y=25/x.

So, let's substitute y=25/x into the first equation, x^10 = y^x.

So, x^10 = (25/x)^x.

Let me write that as x^10 = 25^x / x^x.

Multiply both sides by x^x:

x^{10 +x} = 25^x.

Hmm, so x^{x+10} =25^x.

Hmm, take the xth root of both sides:

x^{(x+10)/x} =25.

Simplify exponent:

x^{1 + 10/x} =25.

Hmm, so x^{1 + 10/x} =25.

Hmm, that's x multiplied by x^{10/x} equals 25.

So, x * (x^{10})^{1/x} =25.

Wait, x^{10/x} is the same as (x^{1/x})^{10}, which is the 10th power of the xth root of x. Hmm, not sure if that helps.

Alternatively, perhaps I can write x^{10/x} as e^{(10/x) ln x}.

Wait, but I'm not sure if that helps either.

Alternatively, maybe I can set z= x^{1/x}. So, z= x^{1/x}, then x^{10/x}= z^{10}.

So, our equation becomes x * z^{10} =25.

But z= x^{1/x}, so x= z^{-x}.

Wait, maybe this substitution is complicating things more.

Alternatively, perhaps I can take the logarithm of both sides of x^{1 +10/x}=25.

So, ln(x^{1 +10/x})= ln25.

Which is (1 +10/x) ln x= ln25.

Which is the same as ln x + (10/x) ln x= ln25.

Hmm, so (1 + 10/x) ln x= ln25.

Which is the same as the equation we had before when we substituted y=25/x into equation (1), right?

So, perhaps another approach is needed.

Wait, going back, we have y=25/x, and x^{x+10}=25^x.

Let me write 25 as 5^2. So, 25^x = (5^2)^x=5^{2x}.

So, x^{x+10}=5^{2x}.

Hmm, maybe we can write both sides with base 5 or something else.

Alternatively, perhaps take the natural log again.

ln(x^{x+10})=ln(5^{2x}).

Which gives (x+10) lnx = 2x ln5.

Which is the same equation as before. Hmm, so I'm going in circles.

Perhaps I can let x=5^k, where k is some exponent. Let's try substituting x=5^k.

Then, since x=5^k, ln x= k ln5.

So, substitute into (x +10) ln x=2x ln5.

So, (5^k +10) * k ln5 = 2*5^k ln5.

Divide both sides by ln5, since ln5 ≠0.

(5^k +10) k = 2 *5^k.

Hmm, so (5^k +10)k=2*5^k.

Let me rearrange this:

5^k * k +10k =2*5^k.

Bring all terms to left side:

5^k *k +10k -2*5^k=0.

Factor out 5^k from the first and third terms:

5^k (k -2) +10k=0.

Hmm, so 5^k (k -2) = -10k.

Hmm, maybe factor k-2:

Hmm, not sure. Let me write this as:

5^k (k -2) +10k=0.

Wait, 5^k (k -2) = -10k.

Hmm, perhaps try some integer values of k.

Let me try k=1: 5^1*(1-2)=5*(-1)=-5. RHS: -10*1=-10. Not equal.

k=2: 5^2*(2-2)=25*0=0. RHS: -10*2=-20. Not equal.

k=3:5^3*(3-2)=125*(1)=125. RHS: -10*3=-30. 125≠-30.

k=0:5^0*(0-2)=1*(-2)=-2. RHS: -10*0=0. Not equal.

k=4:5^4*(4-2)=625*2=1250. RHS: -10*4=-40. Not equal.

Hmm, not helpful. Maybe k is not an integer. Maybe try k= something else.

Wait, maybe k is between 1 and 2. Let me test k=1. Let's see, when k=1, we have -5 on left, RHS -10. So, left is -5, right is -10. So, left is higher.

At k=2, left is 0, right is -20. So, left is higher than right.

Wait, maybe k is negative? Let me try k= -1.

k=-1:5^{-1}*(-1 -2)= (1/5)*(-3)= -3/5. RHS: -10*(-1)=10. So, -3/5 ≈-0.6 ≠10.

Hmm, maybe k is a fraction. Let's try k= something like 0.5.

k=0.5:5^{0.5}*(0.5-2)=sqrt(5)*(-1.5)≈2.236*(-1.5)=≈-3.354.

RHS: -10*0.5= -5. So, -3.354≈-5? No, but they're both negative. So, perhaps k is somewhere between 0.5 and 1?

Wait, at k=0.5, left side is about -3.354, right side is -5. So, left is greater than right.

At k=1, left is -5, right is -10. So, left is greater than right.

Wait, so when k increases from 0.5 to 1, left side goes from -3.354 to -5, while right side goes from -5 to -10. So, the left side is moving downward, and the right side is moving downward faster. So, perhaps there's a point where they cross.

Alternatively, maybe I can set up an equation to solve for k numerically.

Let me write the equation again:

5^k (k -2) = -10k.

Let me rearrange:

5^k (k -2) +10k =0.

Let me define a function f(k) =5^k (k -2) +10k.

I need to find the root of f(k)=0.

We can try using the Newton-Raphson method to approximate k.

First, let's get an idea of where the root is.

We saw that at k=0.5, f(k)=5^{0.5}*(0.5-2)+10*(0.5)=sqrt(5)*(-1.5)+5≈2.236*(-1.5)+5≈-3.354 +5≈1.646.

At k=1: f(1)=5*(1-2)+10*1=5*(-1)+10=5.

Wait, earlier I thought f(1) was -5, but that's incorrect. Let me recalculate:

Wait, f(k)=5^k*(k-2)+10k.

At k=1: 5^1*(1-2) +10*1=5*(-1)+10= -5 +10=5.

At k=0:5^0*(0-2)+10*0=1*(-2)= -2.

Wait, so f(0)= -2, f(0.5)=1.646, f(1)=5.

Wait, so f(k) goes from -2 at k=0, up to 1.646 at k=0.5, then up to 5 at k=1. So, it's increasing from k=0 to k=1. So, there's no root between k=0 and k=1.

Wait, but earlier at k=0.5, f(k)=1.646, which is positive, and at k=0, f(k)=-2.

So, there must be a root between k=0 and k=0.5.

Let me check at k=0.25:

f(0.25)=5^{0.25}*(0.25-2)+10*(0.25)= (approx 1.495)*( -1.75) +2.5≈-2.616 +2.5≈-0.116.

Hmm, so at k=0.25, f(k)=~ -0.116.

At k=0.5, f(k)=1.646.

So, the function crosses zero between k=0.25 and k=0.5.

Let me try k=0.3:

5^0.3 ≈ e^(0.3 ln5)≈e^(0.3*1.60944)=e^(0.48283)≈1.620.

So, f(0.3)=1.620*(0.3-2)+10*0.3=1.620*(-1.7)+3≈-2.754 +3≈0.246.

Hmm, positive.

So, between k=0.25 and k=0.3.

At k=0.25, f(k)=~ -0.116.

At k=0.3, f(k)=0.246.

So, let's try k=0.275.

5^0.275: Let's compute ln5^0.275=0.275*1.60944≈0.4431.

So, e^0.4431≈1.558.

So, f(0.275)=1.558*(0.275 -2) +10*0.275=1.558*(-1.725)+2.75≈-2.693 +2.75≈0.057.

Hmm, positive.

So, f(0.275)= ~0.057.

We need f(k)=0 between 0.25 and 0.275.

Let me try k=0.26.

5^0.26: ln5=1.60944, so 0.26*1.60944≈0.41845.

So, e^0.41845≈1.519.

So, f(0.26)=1.519*(0.26 -2) +10*0.26=1.519*(-1.74)+2.6≈-2.653 +2.6≈-0.053.

So, f(0.26)=~ -0.053.

So, between k=0.26 and 0.275, f(k) goes from -0.053 to 0.057.

So, let me try k=0.2675.

Compute f(0.2675):

5^0.2675: ln5^0.2675=0.2675*1.60944≈0.430.

e^0.430≈1.536.

f(0.2675)=1.536*(0.2675-2) +10*0.2675=1.536*(-1.7325) +2.675≈-2.665 +2.675≈0.01.

Hmm, that's close to zero.

So, f(0.2675)=~0.01.

Now, let me try k=0.266.

5^0.266: ln5^0.266=0.266*1.60944≈0.428.

e^0.428≈1.533.

f(0.266)=1.533*(0.266-2)+10*0.266=1.533*(-1.734)+2.66≈-2.662 +2.66≈-0.002.

So, f(0.266)=~ -0.002.

So, the root is between k=0.266 and k=0.2675.

We can use linear approximation.

At k=0.266, f(k)= -0.002.

At k=0.2675, f(k)=0.01.

The change in k is 0.0015, leading to change in f(k) of 0.012.

We need to find delta such that -0.002 + (0.012)*(delta/0.0015)=0.

So, 0.012*(delta/0.0015)=0.002.

delta/0.0015= 0.002 /0.012= 1/6.

So, delta= (0.0015)*(1/6)=0.00025.

So, approximate root at k=0.266 +0.00025≈0.26625.

So, k≈0.26625.

Thus, x=5^k≈5^0.26625.

Compute 5^0.26625.

We can compute ln5^0.26625=0.26625 *1.60944≈0.4285.

So, e^0.4285≈1.535.

So, x≈1.535.

Then, y=25/x≈25/1.535≈16.3.

Wait, but let me check with the original equations.

Wait, let me see if x≈1.535, y≈16.3.

First equation: log_x(y^x)=10.

Compute y^x=16.3^1.535.

Let me compute ln(16.3)=2.793.

So, ln(y^x)=x ln y=1.535 *2.793≈4.282.

So, y^x= e^{4.282}≈73.3.

Then, log_x(73.3)= ln73.3/lnx= ln73.3/ln1.535≈4.295/(0.428)≈10.03. Which is close to 10, so that's good.

Second equation: log_y(x^{4y})=10.

Compute x^{4y}=1.535^{4*16.3}=1.535^{65.2}.

That's a huge number, but let's compute ln(x^{4y})=4y lnx=65.2 *0.428≈28.08.

So, x^{4y}=e^{28.08}.

Then, log_y(x^{4y})=ln(x^{4y}) /ln y=28.08 /2.793≈9.98≈10. Close enough.

So, our approximation seems okay.

But wait, the question asks for integer xy. Wait, so xy≈1.535 *16.3≈25. So, 25.

Wait, that's interesting. Because y=25/x, so xy=25. So, 25 is the product.

Wait, so perhaps I didn't need to compute x and y numerically. Because from y=25/x, so xy=25.

Wait, that's the product. So, the answer is 25.

Wait, so regardless of the values of x and y, as long as y=25/x, their product is 25.

So, maybe I can see that earlier. Let me retrace.

We found y=25/x, so xy=25.

So, the product is 25. So, 25 is the answer.

Wait, that's a much simpler approach. So, I didn't need to solve for x and y numerically.

Let me verify that.

Given that y=25/x, so xy=25.

So, regardless of the specific values of x and y, their product is 25.

So, perhaps I could have realized that from the earlier steps.

So, that's the answer.

Given the problem, we have two equations involving logarithms:

1. \(\log_x(y^x) = 10\)
2. \(\log_y(x^{4y}) = 10\)

Using the properties of logarithms, we can rewrite these equations as:
1. \(x^{10} = y^x\)
2. \(y^{10} = x^{4y}\)

From the first equation, taking the natural logarithm of both sides, we get:
\[
10 \ln x = x \ln y \quad \text{(1)}
\]

Similarly, from the second equation, taking the natural logarithm of both sides, we get:
\[
10 \ln y = 4y \ln x \quad \text{(2)}
\]

From equation (1), we solve for \(\ln y\):
\[
\ln y = \frac{10 \ln x}{x}
\]

Substituting this into equation (2):
\[
10 \left(\frac{10 \ln x}{x}\right) = 4y \ln x
\]
\[
\frac{100 \ln x}{x} = 4y \ln x
\]

Since \(x > 1\), \(\ln x \neq 0\), so we can divide both sides by \(\ln x\):
\[
\frac{100}{x} = 4y
\]
\[
y = \frac{25}{x}
\]

Thus, we find that \(y = \frac{25}{x}\). The product \(xy\) is then:
\[
xy = x \cdot \frac{25}{x} = 25
\]

Therefore, the value of \(xy\) is \(\boxed{25}\).
