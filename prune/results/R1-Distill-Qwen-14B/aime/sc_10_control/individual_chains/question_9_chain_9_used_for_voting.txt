Okay, so I have this logarithm problem here, and I need to find the product xy where both x and y are greater than 1. The problem states that log base x of y^x equals 10, and log base y of x^(4y) also equals 10. Hmm, that's interesting. Let me try to unpack this step by step.

First, I should probably write down the given equations using logarithm properties. I remember that log base a of b^c is equal to c times log base a of b. So, applying that to the first equation:

log_x(y^x) = 10
Which can be rewritten as x * log_x(y) = 10.

Similarly, the second equation is log_y(x^{4y}) = 10, which becomes 4y * log_y(x) = 10.

Now, I know that log_x(y) and log_y(x) are reciprocals of each other. Because log_x(y) = 1 / log_y(x). Let me denote log_x(y) as some variable to make it easier. Let's say let a = log_x(y). Then, log_y(x) would be 1/a.

So, substituting these into the equations:

First equation: x * a = 10 → equation (1)
Second equation: 4y * (1/a) = 10 → equation (2)

Simplify equation (2): 4y / a = 10 → so, 4y = 10a → y = (10a)/4 = (5a)/2.

So, from equation (1), x * a = 10 → x = 10/a.

Now, I have expressions for x and y in terms of a. Maybe I can relate them through another equation. Since a is log_x(y), and I know that logarithms can be converted using the change of base formula: log_x(y) = ln(y)/ln(x). But maybe I can use the relationship between x and y another way.

Wait, if a = log_x(y), then by the definition of logarithms, x^a = y. So, y = x^a. Hmm, that's another way to write y in terms of x and a.

But earlier, I found y = (5a)/2. So, now I have two expressions for y:

y = x^a and y = (5a)/2.

Therefore, x^a = (5a)/2.

But I also have x = 10/a from equation (1). So substituting x into this equation:

(10/a)^a = (5a)/2.

Hmm, that seems a bit complicated, but maybe I can take the natural logarithm of both sides to simplify. Let's do that.

Take ln of both sides:

ln( (10/a)^a ) = ln( (5a)/2 )

On the left side, I can bring down the exponent:

a * ln(10/a) = ln(5a/2)

Okay, so that gives me an equation in terms of a. Let me write it again:

a * ln(10/a) = ln(5a/2)

I can expand both sides using logarithm rules. Let's first handle the left side:

ln(10/a) = ln(10) - ln(a). So the left side becomes a*(ln(10) - ln(a)).

The right side is ln(5a/2) = ln(5) + ln(a) - ln(2). Wait, no, actually, ln(5a/2) = ln(5) + ln(a) - ln(2) because 5a/2 = 5/2 * a. So, it's ln(5/2) + ln(a).

So putting it all together:

Left side: a*(ln(10) - ln(a))
Right side: ln(5/2) + ln(a)

So the equation is:

a*(ln(10) - ln(a)) = ln(5/2) + ln(a)

Let me expand the left side:

a*ln(10) - a*ln(a) = ln(5/2) + ln(a)

Hmm, let's bring all terms to one side:

a*ln(10) - a*ln(a) - ln(5/2) - ln(a) = 0

Factor terms where possible. Let's see, the terms with a:

a*(ln(10) - ln(a)) and the others are constants with a:

Wait, perhaps rearrange the equation:

a*ln(10) - a*ln(a) - ln(a) - ln(5/2) = 0

Factor out a from the first three terms? Wait, no. Let me see:

Wait, a*ln(10) is separate. Then, terms with a: -a*ln(a), and terms without a: -ln(a) - ln(5/2). Hmm, maybe factor ln(a) from the terms that have it.

Wait, let me group:

a*ln(10) - a*ln(a) - ln(a) - ln(5/2) = 0

= a*(ln(10) - ln(a)) - ln(a) - ln(5/2) = 0

Hmm, not sure if that helps. Maybe factor out ln(a):

= a*(ln(10) - ln(a)) - [ln(a) + ln(5/2)] = 0

Alternatively, perhaps make a substitution to simplify. Let me let t = ln(a). Then, a = e^t, so let's try substituting:

So, t = ln(a) → a = e^t.

Plug into the equation:

a*ln(10) - a*ln(a) = ln(5/2) + ln(a)

Substitute a = e^t:

e^t * ln(10) - e^t * ln(e^t) = ln(5/2) + ln(e^t)

Simplify each term:

ln(e^t) is t, so left side becomes e^t * ln(10) - e^t * t.

Right side: ln(5/2) + t.

So now the equation is:

e^t * ln(10) - e^t * t = ln(5/2) + t

Bring all terms to the left:

e^t * ln(10) - e^t * t - ln(5/2) - t = 0

Factor terms where possible. Let's factor t in the middle terms:

= e^t * ln(10) - t*(e^t + 1) - ln(5/2) = 0

Hmm, this seems tricky. Maybe try plugging in some values for t to see if I can find a solution. Alternatively, perhaps there's a substitution or another approach.

Wait, let's check the original equations again. Maybe instead of going through logarithms, I can use the expressions for x and y in terms of a and set up another equation.

Earlier, I had:

y = x^a

And x = 10/a.

So, substituting x into y:

y = (10/a)^a

But also, from equation (2), y = (5a)/2.

Therefore, set these equal:

(10/a)^a = (5a)/2

Hmm, so (10/a)^a = (5a)/2

Maybe take the natural log again:

a * ln(10/a) = ln(5a/2)

Wait, that's the same equation as before. So, perhaps this is a dead end. Maybe I should try to express everything in terms of a single variable.

Alternatively, perhaps I can express x in terms of y or vice versa.

Wait, let me think. From the first equation, log_x(y^x) = 10 → x * log_x(y) = 10 → log_x(y) = 10/x.

Similarly, from the second equation, log_y(x^{4y}) = 10 → 4y * log_y(x) = 10 → log_y(x) = 10/(4y).

But since log_x(y) = 1 / log_y(x), we can set [10/x] = 1 / [10/(4y)].

Wait, let's write that:

log_x(y) = 10/x and log_y(x) = 10/(4y)

Since log_x(y) = 1 / log_y(x), so:

10/x = 1 / (10/(4y)) → 10/x = (4y)/10 → cross-multiplying:

10 * 10 = x * 4y → 100 = 4xy → xy = 25.

Wait, that seems straightforward. Did I miss that earlier? Hmm, let me recheck.

So, starting again, from the two equations:

log_x(y^x) = 10 → x * log_x(y) = 10 → equation (1): log_x(y) = 10/x.

Similarly, log_y(x^{4y}) = 10 → 4y * log_y(x) = 10 → equation (2): log_y(x) = 10/(4y).

But since log_x(y) = 1 / log_y(x), so:

log_x(y) = 1 / [log_y(x)] → 10/x = 1 / (10/(4y)).

So, 10/x = (4y)/10 → cross multiply: 100 = 4xy → xy = 25.

Oh, right! So that's the answer. So xy is 25. That's much simpler than the earlier approach.

I think I complicated things earlier by introducing variable a and trying to substitute, but this way, using the reciprocal relationship of logarithms, I can solve it directly.

So, the product xy is 25.

We are given two logarithmic equations involving real numbers \( x \) and \( y \), both greater than 1. The equations are:

\[
\log_x(y^x) = 10 \quad \text{and} \quad \log_y(x^{4y}) = 10.
\]

Using properties of logarithms, we rewrite these equations as:

1. \( x \cdot \log_x(y) = 10 \)  
2. \( 4y \cdot \log_y(x) = 10 \).

Since \( \log_x(y) \) and \( \log_y(x) \) are reciprocals, let \( \log_x(y) = \frac{10}{x} \) and \( \log_y(x) = \frac{10}{4y} \). Using the reciprocal relationship, we have:

\[
\frac{10}{x} = \frac{1}{\frac{10}{4y}}.
\]

Simplifying this:

\[
\frac{10}{x} = \frac{4y}{10} \implies 100 = 4xy \implies xy = 25.
\]

Thus, the product \( xy \) is:

\[
\boxed{25}
\]
